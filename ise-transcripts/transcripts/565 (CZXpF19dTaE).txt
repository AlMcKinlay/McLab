super effective I'm your host Steve with (0:27 - 0:33)
me is Greg hello happy Mother's day (0:30 - 0:35)
since recording on a Mother's Day those (0:33 - 0:38)
who celebrate and the only holiday that (0:35 - 0:40)
exists in the Pokemon world we will not (0:38 - 0:42)
be doing this for Father's Day because (0:40 - 0:44)
there are no fathers apparently (0:42 - 0:46)
unless you're in Hawaii is the only (0:44 - 0:48)
place that has a father Norman I just (0:46 - 0:51)
think about this today like how are we (0:48 - 0:52)
still (0:51 - 0:55)
only dealing with mothers at Hope like (0:52 - 0:58)
we still have this weird Homemaker mom (0:55 - 1:00)
only World in Pokemon because I (0:58 - 1:03)
restarted sword and shield again (1:00 - 1:06)
and I'm like wait we're still here was (1:03 - 1:08)
there a dad in Scarlet Violet no there's (1:06 - 1:10)
still no dads (1:08 - 1:12)
what is going on in this universe (1:10 - 1:16)
the Nintendo video game trope (1:12 - 1:19)
as someone who grew up with (1:16 - 1:22)
a secure it for me (1:19 - 1:25)
there you go Hannah's also here (1:22 - 1:25)

I moved to a different state so I didn't (1:36 - 1:39)
have to be around my parents it worked (1:38 - 1:43)
out well I'm this morning for brunch and (1:39 - 1:44)
my mother-in-law last week because (1:43 - 1:48)
they're traveling this week (1:44 - 1:48)
all right so on today's show we have uh (1:49 - 1:53)
Chestnut (1:52 - 1:55)
the (1:53 - 1:58)
you know coincidence or not that one of (1:55 - 2:00)
the least popular I'm not saying (1:58 - 2:02)
that people don't like Chestnut I'm just (2:00 - 2:05)
saying Chestnut is very (2:02 - 2:07)
not popular compared to the other (2:05 - 2:09)
Pokemon out there (2:07 - 2:11)
uh the weekend of (2:09 - 2:14)
breath of the wild where I think the (2:11 - 2:16)
entire internet shut down to play that (2:14 - 2:19)
game uh breath of the wild excuse me oh (2:16 - 2:21)
sorry tears of the Kingdom breath of the (2:19 - 2:24)
wild two two tears the kingdom or as (2:21 - 2:25)
every time I see the abbreviation I (2:24 - 2:27)
think Tick Tock yeah I also think (2:25 - 2:29)
tic-tock when I see the abbreviation uh (2:27 - 2:31)
we have some Pokemon go news but not (2:29 - 2:34)
about the game about a pretty big (2:31 - 2:37)
Community uh shutting down and then we (2:34 - 2:39)
have some new characters coming to unite (2:37 - 2:42)
which is pretty exciting yeah some new (2:39 - 2:44)
characters in Pokemon Masters some new (2:42 - 2:49)
anime coming and if you are going to the (2:44 - 2:51)
North American International (2:49 - 2:55)
championships in unfortunately Ohio uh (2:51 - 2:57)
we can give you the best information on (2:55 - 2:58)
how to (2:57 - 3:00)
navigate (2:58 - 3:03)
Ohio I guess (3:00 - 3:06)
I'm not sure (3:03 - 3:08)
people for that (3:06 - 3:10)
I mean the convention center-wise not (3:08 - 3:13)
surrounding the convention center that (3:10 - 3:16)
you're on your own for that (3:13 - 3:18)
uh all right so they announced Chestnut (3:16 - 3:22)
uh this was weakened one of that it will (3:18 - 3:25)
come back on the 18th well technically (3:22 - 3:29)
the 19th but UTC time so uh if you're in (3:25 - 3:31)
America it'd be the evening of the 18th (3:29 - 3:35)
19th 20th and 21st (3:31 - 3:39)
um Chestnut was Rock Terror type uh (3:35 - 3:42)
meaning it was weak to like water and (3:39 - 3:44)
grass and fighting and whatever else (3:42 - 3:47)
walk is week two steel there's one more (3:44 - 3:50)
ground I believe (3:47 - 3:53)
um grounded water or weak to Grass which (3:50 - 3:57)
is its primary tarot type uh steel is (3:53 - 3:59)
weak to (3:57 - 4:02)
fighting which is his other I guess (3:59 - 4:03)
people didn't know this Chestnut is (4:02 - 4:06)
grass fighting for (4:03 - 4:06)
it does have a secondary Terror type uh (4:07 - 4:12)
it's fighting (4:10 - 4:16)
um who knew who knew who could have (4:12 - 4:18)
possibly known the Pokemon that's been (4:16 - 4:21)
around for how many years now (4:18 - 4:25)
uh 10 I think X and Y is almost 10. all (4:21 - 4:27)
right I think it would be 10 in America (4:25 - 4:29)
yeah well that was the first worldwide (4:27 - 4:32)
game so yeah Ken I believe this October (4:29 - 4:34)
it would be (4:32 - 4:34)
um I think that's correct (4:35 - 4:40)
you know 20 was that 2013 (4:37 - 4:42)
yeah I think so I think so when I was (4:40 - 4:45)
making the thumbnail for my like raid (4:42 - 4:47)
help guide or whatever I didn't realize (4:45 - 4:49)
like Chestnut it's just like a bald dude (4:47 - 4:52)
he like doesn't have anything on it he (4:49 - 4:54)
doesn't have like ears or anything he (4:52 - 4:56)
doesn't have like how many horns yeah (4:54 - 4:58)
but the helmet doesn't have any like (4:56 - 5:02)
it's just a circular October 12th 2013. (4:58 - 5:05)
yike (5:02 - 5:05)
that's one big old helmet it's a big (5:06 - 5:10)
helmet it's a paladin he's he's (5:08 - 5:12)
protected (5:10 - 5:14)
yeah I think some people thought they (5:12 - 5:15)
were gonna make him Steel type which (5:14 - 5:18)
would have thought the pallet Paladin (5:15 - 5:21)
theme uh but but whatever I mean like (5:18 - 5:24)
rock made sense for the you know (5:21 - 5:26)
bring water Pokemon and then forget that (5:24 - 5:29)
he's actually we're still like we're six (5:26 - 5:31)
months in this game people still really (5:29 - 5:34)
struggling with Terror types here (5:31 - 5:37)
just uh just you know (5:34 - 5:40)
I remember back when X and Y was coming (5:37 - 5:42)
out I don't know if you two remember (5:40 - 5:44)
correct me or add-on (5:42 - 5:47)
but because that was a worldwide game (5:44 - 5:50)
yeah there were so many rumors that this (5:47 - 5:52)
was the time they were like X and Y (5:50 - 5:54)
they're gonna change the starter Pokemon (5:52 - 5:57)
we're no longer getting fire grass and (5:54 - 6:01)
water we're gonna get like dark psychic (5:57 - 6:02)
and fighting or something like that yeah (6:01 - 6:06)
it was dark side about that and that (6:02 - 6:09)
that was excited for it so hard and then (6:06 - 6:12)
it ended up coming out where they were (6:09 - 6:15)
water grass fire and then a subset a (6:12 - 6:17)
group of fans were like ah we're so sick (6:15 - 6:21)
of this I wish they would mix it up (6:17 - 6:25)
it is very clear now that the reason it (6:21 - 6:28)
is water fire and grass is because we (6:25 - 6:30)
all went online you guys can't hide it (6:28 - 6:32)
anymore none of you guys don't know (6:30 - 6:35)
typing words (6:32 - 6:35)
dark fighting and psychic (6:35 - 6:41)
it was yes the final Evolutions were (6:38 - 6:43)
what the like so we weren't wrong were (6:41 - 6:47)
we no we weren't Mr sassy pants thinking (6:43 - 6:51)
you caught everybody nah we were right I (6:47 - 6:53)
didn't get anyone they got themselves (6:51 - 6:56)
were they locked into a guard shop (6:53 - 7:00)
against like a frost last (6:56 - 7:00)
they outed themselves at not knowing (7:02 - 7:10)
weaknesses and resistances Tara type (7:06 - 7:11)
means all the moves and everything (7:10 - 7:14)
changes that's what Tara means it's a (7:11 - 7:16)
completely different Pokemon all rules (7:14 - 7:18)
are off (7:16 - 7:21)
just go with go with the flow what do (7:18 - 7:23)
you feel should be super effective and (7:21 - 7:25)
the game will probably allow that to (7:23 - 7:27)
happen (7:25 - 7:27)
it's a wild time (7:28 - 7:32)
um I like to I like the the theme they (7:30 - 7:34)
were going with Chestnut they gave it (7:32 - 7:38)
three different different ways to (7:34 - 7:42)
um boost its its physical defense mm-hmm (7:38 - 7:44)
although the last (7:42 - 7:47)
two or three tarot raids The Raid boss (7:44 - 7:49)
doesn't like (7:47 - 7:52)
clear itself it just clears you (7:49 - 7:55)
well a chestnut never cleared itself so (7:52 - 7:58)
if you if you I'm gonna argue (7:55 - 8:00)
it depends on how long you were in that (7:58 - 8:02)
raid (8:00 - 8:06)
okay go on because I was into a random (8:02 - 8:08)
one that I thought (8:06 - 8:14)
we have a slight shot at doing this (8:08 - 8:14)
I was in that raid for nobody died (8:14 - 8:23)
but it was the full timer (8:20 - 8:27)
nobody could do anything to actually do (8:23 - 8:29)
enough damage because the Pokemon they (8:27 - 8:30)
brought and I was keeping everybody (8:29 - 8:32)
alive which was my mistake but I got (8:30 - 8:35)
really interested at that point look how (8:32 - 8:38)
lucky this keeps going and you know (8:35 - 8:40)
that's when I learned and had the move (8:38 - 8:42)
curse that at some point it does start (8:40 - 8:44)
clearing things because it's like okay (8:42 - 8:47)
you've been in this forever let's just (8:44 - 8:49)
we're gonna just ramp this up it starts (8:47 - 8:52)
critting a lot more I'm like yeah that (8:49 - 8:54)
makes sense because (8:52 - 8:56)
I can't I can't sit in here anymore like (8:54 - 8:59)
I want to go I want to leave this right (8:56 - 9:02)
but I'm morbidly interested in how long (8:59 - 9:04)
if we can go the whole timer and it (9:02 - 9:06)
actually we went almost the entire timer (9:04 - 9:08)
until it started like (9:06 - 9:09)
clearing everything and creating (9:08 - 9:13)
everybody and then it sort of chunks (9:09 - 9:15)
down towards the end but I was in that (9:13 - 9:19)
thing for a long time (9:15 - 9:19)
uh it is it is day 213 of asking (9:20 - 9:29)
game freak to please put levels next to (9:25 - 9:32)
Pokemon before you enter into raids (9:29 - 9:35)
I I successfully did like 50 raids this (9:32 - 9:38)
weekend I maxed out my rock type tarot (9:35 - 9:40)
shards or whatever I maxed out my rare (9:38 - 9:42)
candy again I had to sell (9:40 - 9:44)
the one raid (9:42 - 9:47)
that I failed out of 50 was because a (9:44 - 9:50)
level 47 annihilate joined and there was (9:47 - 9:54)
that is you just can't you just can't (9:50 - 9:56)
you could be like done at that point (9:54 - 9:58)
yeah like tell the person to put down (9:56 - 10:00)
their controller (9:58 - 10:03)
they're they're not listening you can (10:00 - 10:06)
tell by the Pokemon choice you can tell (10:03 - 10:09)
by the level choice you there there's no (10:06 - 10:14)
hope we have in this world but Steve the (10:09 - 10:16)
lower the level the less they take off (10:14 - 10:19)
time when they die (10:16 - 10:19)
we had to reflect (10:25 - 10:31)
I mean I will say the one that I was in (10:29 - 10:33)
for 15 years everybody's at the (10:31 - 10:34)
appropriate level which is why it lasted (10:33 - 10:37)
for so long it just they didn't have any (10:34 - 10:39)
they didn't have any actual attacks like (10:37 - 10:40)
they didn't have anything that was going (10:39 - 10:42)
to do anything and I'm like well I'll (10:40 - 10:45)
just sit here and drop kick that's so (10:42 - 10:48)
weird usually randoms are so eager to (10:45 - 10:52)
attack yeah I I honestly I mean and the (10:48 - 10:54)
thing is is they were eager to attack (10:52 - 10:58)
but they all brought bad tight matchups (10:54 - 10:58)
Circle (11:01 - 11:04)
I'm like okay here's a shiny charizard (11:04 - 11:11)
that's (11:09 - 11:11)
Dylan something (11:11 - 11:14)
it's there (11:13 - 11:17)
it's stand alive (11:14 - 11:20)
uh uh uh uh stay in life (11:17 - 11:24)
um yeah I I still I still adore (11:20 - 11:27)
these raids I I like building Pokemon (11:24 - 11:30)
for them I I like doing them with people (11:27 - 11:34)
uh it scratches the itch that I needed (11:30 - 11:37)
leaving or not leaving but not having (11:34 - 11:38)
any time in my life for playing Final (11:37 - 11:41)
Fantasy or Destiny or any of these other (11:38 - 11:43)
games that have (11:41 - 11:45)
coordinated group I will say coordinated (11:43 - 11:48)
group contents (11:45 - 11:48)
I know I did my what what was that day (11:49 - 11:54)
Thursday yeah yeah you were extreme I (11:51 - 11:57)
did Thursday and then I was like okay (11:54 - 11:59)
we're done I don't need to do this (11:57 - 12:03)
anymore yeah I I (11:59 - 12:06)
think if there are people like me who (12:03 - 12:09)
keep doing it until you get to 999 (12:06 - 12:12)
shards and I build like six different (12:09 - 12:13)
Pokemon because I'm like oh I'm feeling (12:12 - 12:15)
Appleton I'm feeling laurentus let me (12:13 - 12:17)
like I (12:15 - 12:18)
I I think that there are people like me (12:17 - 12:21)
that are probably very few and far in (12:18 - 12:22)
between but (12:21 - 12:24)
um yeah I think I think the majority of (12:22 - 12:26)
people are probably just doing it once (12:24 - 12:28)
when you can play with a good group when (12:26 - 12:30)
you can play with people who are excited (12:28 - 12:32)
about it it's a really good experience (12:30 - 12:34)
of everybody I've talked to all of my (12:32 - 12:36)
friends who have the game and have tried (12:34 - 12:38)
doing these raids (12:36 - 12:40)
unless I send them to a group who knows (12:38 - 12:42)
how to do them they kind of just get (12:40 - 12:44)
tired with building a Pokemon and and (12:42 - 12:46)
with trying to do it at all they will (12:44 - 12:49)
just get one through wonder trade and (12:46 - 12:51)
read it that way (12:49 - 12:53)
yeah I um (12:51 - 12:57)
I I ran into a Vaporeon six star (12:53 - 12:59)
Vaporeon right before Chestnut (12:57 - 13:01)
and I was like oh I can't connect to the (12:59 - 13:03)
internet because (13:01 - 13:04)
have you ever like saved in front of (13:03 - 13:06)
like a six star raid and then like oh (13:04 - 13:08)
I'm gonna invite Greg and then as soon (13:06 - 13:09)
as you connect to the internet my RAID (13:08 - 13:13)
disappears yeah uh because it refreshes (13:09 - 13:17)
so I'm like oh okay I uh (13:13 - 13:19)
uh I can't I can't invite you guys and (13:17 - 13:21)
it's not like I need I was like I I it's (13:19 - 13:24)
it's a it's a water Vaporeon raid like (13:21 - 13:27)
it's whatever and but it's boosted Urban (13:24 - 13:29)
mystica because vaporeon's like one of (13:27 - 13:30)
like the 10 Pokemon that have like a (13:29 - 13:32)
higher chance of urban mystica so I was (13:30 - 13:33)
like ah this sucks because I want to (13:32 - 13:35)
like invite people just for the urban (13:33 - 13:39)
mystica and I went through it (13:35 - 13:42)
and I accidentally locked in the wrong (13:39 - 13:43)
Pokemon and I was like oh I was gonna (13:42 - 13:45)
bring belly bald I accidentally brought (13:43 - 13:47)
to cgy I was like that's fine and I got (13:45 - 13:49)
it to like a sliver of health and then I (13:47 - 13:51)
was like oh you've been put to sleep and (13:49 - 13:53)
I was like okay well I'm out of heels (13:51 - 13:55)
the last like 30 seconds I literally (13:53 - 13:57)
just need to wake up and do one move and (13:55 - 14:00)
of course I didn't wake up so the raid (13:57 - 14:02)
failed what about your NPCs they were (14:00 - 14:04)
there to help (14:02 - 14:04)
too bad it's a special attacker so I go (14:07 - 14:13)
back in uh I go back in with belly Bolt (14:10 - 14:18)
and I the Sleep problem solved (14:13 - 14:19)
um but I ended up getting like crit (14:18 - 14:22)
twice so again I like needed one more (14:19 - 14:25)
turn failed the raid and then I was like (14:22 - 14:27)
oh let me just change the hell item go (14:25 - 14:29)
back in same thing happened I ended up (14:27 - 14:31)
getting crit and I was like why I I (14:29 - 14:33)
should go back to the other held item (14:31 - 14:35)
and then impressively strong Vaporeon I (14:33 - 14:38)
know yeah yeah yeah (14:35 - 14:38)
uh setting up rain and then critting in (14:38 - 14:45)
the rain with surfing it's unfortunate (14:41 - 14:47)
I I (14:45 - 14:47)
after that third fail of like okay the (14:49 - 14:53)
first one was my fault kind of brought (14:52 - 14:55)
the wrong Pokemon second one like ah (14:53 - 15:00)
crit ah crit I was like it it was I (14:55 - 15:01)
don't know if you you both have played (15:00 - 15:03)
Monster Hunter it is like the monster (15:01 - 15:06)
hunter feeling in Monster Hunter you do (15:03 - 15:07)
like these really long hunts because (15:06 - 15:09)
monster hunter is like huge boss battles (15:07 - 15:10)
and they're like 45 minutes long unless (15:09 - 15:12)
you're like really good you can come to (15:10 - 15:15)
like 12 13 minutes but there's nothing (15:12 - 15:18)
more frustrating in Monster Hunter than (15:15 - 15:21)
to go for almost all 45 minutes and then (15:18 - 15:24)
die the third time and then it boots you (15:21 - 15:28)
out of like you get nothing you have you (15:24 - 15:30)
have died three times your 45 minutes (15:28 - 15:35)
are are not refunded try fresh again (15:30 - 15:37)
and (15:35 - 15:40)
I think that is a real we don't talk (15:37 - 15:41)
about this enough obviously this has (15:40 - 15:42)
been a problem since day one but like (15:41 - 15:45)
I'd imagine somebody who doesn't have (15:42 - 15:48)
like a lot of Pokemon built or a lot of (15:45 - 15:49)
resources (15:48 - 15:51)
and they lose to a six star raid three (15:49 - 15:54)
times oh yeah I think they're probably (15:51 - 15:57)
done right right yeah they're done I (15:54 - 15:59)
mean this exists I mean it's one of the (15:57 - 16:01)
weird things that like (15:59 - 16:04)
this was a problem in MMOs for large (16:01 - 16:08)
raids right like uh 24 or 40 men content (16:04 - 16:10)
was never a guarantee that you're gonna (16:08 - 16:12)
get to the end and it was three to four (16:10 - 16:13)
hours (16:12 - 16:17)
at a time and like unless you were in it (16:13 - 16:20)
to (16:17 - 16:20)
like I just want to complete this (16:20 - 16:25)
content because completion is the goal (16:22 - 16:27)
and I'm willing to do however long it (16:25 - 16:30)
takes people dropped out all the time (16:27 - 16:33)
like Final Fantasy 14 solved that (16:30 - 16:35)
problem by making different levels like (16:33 - 16:36)
if you want to smash your head against (16:35 - 16:38)
the wall and be the best then you're (16:36 - 16:40)
gonna go do Savage content because that (16:38 - 16:42)
is literally smashing your head against (16:40 - 16:44)
the wall until everybody can execute it (16:42 - 16:46)
exactly perfectly and I don't have time (16:44 - 16:49)
for that in my life anymore but they (16:46 - 16:51)
have other ways but it's also the (16:49 - 16:53)
problem of (16:51 - 16:55)
yeah I'll run into people who are like I (16:53 - 16:57)
just hate doing raid content and I (16:55 - 16:59)
always say Well when do you do it and if (16:57 - 17:00)
they doing it on the weekends I'm like (16:59 - 17:02)
well that's the problem because you're (17:00 - 17:04)
doing it with people who don't know what (17:02 - 17:06)
they're doing and you can't complete it (17:04 - 17:08)
it is just it is frustration after (17:06 - 17:11)
frustration after frustration nobody is (17:08 - 17:13)
in there explaining the moves to you (17:11 - 17:15)
because they also don't know (17:13 - 17:17)
like (17:15 - 17:20)
like when you get this is this is the (17:17 - 17:24)
unique MMO feeling is when you get in (17:20 - 17:27)
to a raid and it says two people are (17:24 - 17:29)
viewing the cutscene which means it's (17:27 - 17:30)
the first time there and it's both (17:29 - 17:32)
healers you're like (17:30 - 17:34)
oh boy (17:32 - 17:37)
two new healers I don't know can I get (17:34 - 17:39)
out of this should I accept the penalty (17:37 - 17:42)
for ditching right now (17:39 - 17:45)
I don't know should I (17:42 - 17:47)
but (17:45 - 17:48)
the the problem that I think they're (17:47 - 17:50)
facing for an uphill climb is is one of (17:48 - 17:54)
the only things that isn't PVP post game (17:50 - 17:57)
the rewards aren't great after you do it (17:54 - 18:01)
once and they themselves don't have a (17:57 - 18:02)
good way of explaining what's happening (18:01 - 18:04)
to people and if you're trying to do it (18:02 - 18:06)
on your own since it doesn't really ever (18:04 - 18:09)
give a lot of explanations you are just (18:06 - 18:11)
hitting your head against the brick wall (18:09 - 18:13)
for (18:11 - 18:16)
nothing in a lot of ways like you are (18:13 - 18:18)
getting things in game to make that (18:16 - 18:20)
stuff easier but if you're discouraged (18:18 - 18:22)
from doing them those rewards no longer (18:20 - 18:26)
matter because fine I got Tara shards to (18:22 - 18:28)
make the other things other raids easier (18:26 - 18:31)
but I'm over rating I don't want to do (18:28 - 18:32)
this anymore (18:31 - 18:35)
are you talking about seven star Seven (18:32 - 18:36)
Star well also six star because like (18:35 - 18:38)
Urban mystica is also sort of like a (18:36 - 18:39)
nebulous thing that if you don't go (18:38 - 18:42)
online and read about the perfect shiny (18:39 - 18:44)
sandwiches to make it's like okay so I (18:42 - 18:46)
got this mystical what does it do you (18:44 - 18:50)
know what's crazy is uh I I I don't ever (18:46 - 18:52)
save before I I like run into a Shiny (18:50 - 18:55)
Pokemon because I'm I'm always confident (18:52 - 18:56)
that I will catch it I always have like (18:55 - 19:00)
enough resources like and whatever but I (18:56 - 19:03)
will save before I make a sandwich using (19:00 - 19:06)
Urban mystica because I am not confident (19:03 - 19:08)
that the sandwich isn't going to fall (19:06 - 19:10)
apart and I'm gonna lose my Urban (19:08 - 19:14)
mystical Caboose yeah yep like let's (19:10 - 19:15)
also telling like people are like just (19:14 - 19:17)
do open face sandwiches I'm like that (19:15 - 19:20)
defeats the purpose of this game if (19:17 - 19:22)
putting the bread down (19:20 - 19:24)
it's not even the open face it's like (19:22 - 19:26)
when you're trying to like pull the (19:24 - 19:28)
sausage and then the tablecloth is like (19:26 - 19:32)
and you're like ah what is happening (19:28 - 19:34)
you know my ride on zooming around you (19:32 - 19:36)
like you need to calm down and make it a (19:34 - 19:38)
sandwich (19:36 - 19:40)
there's like this weird balance though (19:38 - 19:42)
to go back to the raid stuff of like so (19:40 - 19:44)
in five star raids Urban mystica is an (19:42 - 19:47)
11 drop out of all five star raids (19:44 - 19:49)
obviously there are some that have a (19:47 - 19:50)
higher drop and then in six star raids (19:49 - 19:53)
it's only a 13 drop so it's really not (19:50 - 19:55)
that much higher (19:53 - 19:58)
um so I think there is like the (19:55 - 20:01)
we understand that six stars is harder (19:58 - 20:03)
so we don't want to make it like (20:01 - 20:06)
more like like you can still get it in (20:03 - 20:08)
five stars like just you know it it (20:06 - 20:10)
there's not a huge difference between 11 (20:08 - 20:12)
and 13. (20:10 - 20:14)
but there's also like the (20:12 - 20:16)
um like always I'm gonna use Destiny in (20:14 - 20:18)
Destiny there was something called uh (20:16 - 20:20)
like the Nightfall you can only do it (20:18 - 20:23)
once a week it was a three-person (20:20 - 20:26)
um strike so strikes were just get from (20:23 - 20:28)
point A get to point B there's a there's (20:26 - 20:29)
a middle boss there's an end boss (20:28 - 20:31)
there's a bunch of enemies in between (20:29 - 20:33)
and (20:31 - 20:36)
that was it and and so all Nightfall was (20:33 - 20:38)
was a harder version of a strike so it's (20:36 - 20:40)
ultimately like five stars and six stars (20:38 - 20:42)
all six stars is is a little bit harder (20:40 - 20:44)
right a little bit higher they might (20:42 - 20:46)
have a little a couple moves so everyone (20:44 - 20:47)
knows how to do the strike it's just the (20:46 - 20:50)
Nightfall is is a lot harder and you can (20:47 - 20:51)
only do it once a week and you get (20:50 - 20:53)
better Rewards (20:51 - 20:53)
you would want to do that with other (20:54 - 20:59)
people because your other option is to (20:56 - 21:01)
do the Nightfall by yourself or do the (20:59 - 21:03)
Nightfall with three people there's no (21:01 - 21:04)
difficulty change except that you have (21:03 - 21:06)
two other people shooting guns with you (21:04 - 21:08)
then there were some people that were (21:06 - 21:10)
like I want to do this by myself because (21:08 - 21:11)
I want it to be as hard as possible (21:10 - 21:13)
that's cool you don't get any extra (21:11 - 21:16)
rewards for that but like (21:13 - 21:19)
why would you like for me it's like (21:16 - 21:21)
I've done these a million times I don't (21:19 - 21:22)
I don't need to like prove to my (21:21 - 21:25)
LinkedIn that I'm doing the solo like I (21:22 - 21:26)
would like to get it done 20 minutes (21:25 - 21:29)
faster because I got things to do so of (21:26 - 21:30)
course I would want to do it with other (21:29 - 21:32)
people (21:30 - 21:34)
um but at the time there was no (21:32 - 21:36)
matchmaking in Destiny for Nightfall you (21:34 - 21:39)
had to go to a subreddit or something or (21:36 - 21:41)
a website to like pair up with two other (21:39 - 21:44)
people because it was slightly harder (21:41 - 21:47)
and (21:44 - 21:50)
that is the thing that they made in (21:47 - 21:54)
Pokemon like it is so much easier oh (21:50 - 21:56)
yeah like if it during that Vaporeon (21:54 - 21:59)
raid it I can't (21:56 - 22:01)
lower it special attack (21:59 - 22:04)
lower lower its defenses remove rain (22:01 - 22:07)
prevent sleep and attack all the at the (22:04 - 22:10)
same time I wish my NPCs were doing one (22:07 - 22:13)
of those four or not but they're not (22:10 - 22:14)
that is not what they're there for (22:13 - 22:17)
they're for intimidation (22:14 - 22:20)
and buffing their own stats (22:17 - 22:22)
um but but yeah that's kind of the thing (22:20 - 22:26)
is like yeah I I could do this solo and (22:22 - 22:26)
like (22:26 - 22:30)
I did it solo but like who are you (22:26 - 22:32)
pressing like (22:30 - 22:34)
as it has been designed for group (22:32 - 22:37)
content yeah and I get if you don't have (22:34 - 22:40)
somebody to do it with but (22:37 - 22:40)
the the online experience isn't there (22:42 - 22:46)
yet either (22:44 - 22:48)
right I mean there are people who do (22:46 - 22:50)
solo Dungeons and MMOs right like they (22:48 - 22:52)
go in by themselves like I'm going to (22:50 - 22:54)
prove to you that I can do this which is (22:52 - 22:55)
like (22:54 - 22:58)
cool I'm glad that you tested your own (22:55 - 23:00)
skill against it I'm glad that made you (22:58 - 23:02)
happy I don't want to do that I don't (23:00 - 23:03)
want to be like I don't want to devote (23:02 - 23:05)
the (23:03 - 23:08)
four hours to doing it exactly perfectly (23:05 - 23:10)
and starting over and over and over and (23:08 - 23:12)
over and over again I just want to get (23:10 - 23:13)
in with a group of people who know what (23:12 - 23:15)
they're doing they burn through the (23:13 - 23:17)
content so that I get my rewards for the (23:15 - 23:19)
week and move on (23:17 - 23:21)
uh I (23:19 - 23:25)
laughs I think (23:21 - 23:25)
at some point Pokemon is going to have (23:26 - 23:31)
to deal with their communication problem (23:29 - 23:33)
in game (23:31 - 23:37)
because what you can say in game is (23:33 - 23:42)
nothing and the bare minimum having (23:37 - 23:46)
pre-programmed announcements (23:42 - 23:49)
would be really nice as a way to Signal (23:46 - 23:52)
the people I am doing this so that for (23:49 - 23:55)
example if I'm in a Seven Star raid and (23:52 - 23:58)
I'm going to heal cheer I heal cheer and (23:55 - 24:00)
then two other people here chair at the (23:58 - 24:02)
exact same time because we all saw it (24:00 - 24:05)
but there was no way for us to tell each (24:02 - 24:08)
other I'm going to do it so we all did (24:05 - 24:10)
it and wasted it so like it would be (24:08 - 24:12)
Nintendo and Pokemon still think like (24:10 - 24:16)
everyone's sitting on the couch together (24:12 - 24:16)
that's what they want again is like how (24:18 - 24:22)
you want people to play the game and how (24:21 - 24:24)
people are actually playing the game are (24:22 - 24:27)
often do very different things (24:24 - 24:30)
and basic like I get you don't want open (24:27 - 24:31)
communication because it's quote unquote (24:30 - 24:33)
family blah blah blah blah and you don't (24:31 - 24:34)
want kids so if there was open (24:33 - 24:36)
communication I would have been banned (24:34 - 24:37)
from Nintendo online for a moment and (24:36 - 24:42)
like everyone oh yeah I mean I I get the (24:37 - 24:44)
reasons why but you can still do (24:42 - 24:46)
pre-programmed (24:44 - 24:49)
yeah yeah (24:46 - 24:51)
they have pre-programmed ones in unite (24:49 - 24:53)
that people tend to ignore anyways but (24:51 - 24:55)
at least you're able to start a signal (24:53 - 24:57)
hey I'm doing this I'm doing that so at (24:55 - 24:59)
least you give some information away (24:57 - 25:03)
whereas in this like unless and even the (24:59 - 25:05)
weird thing is like even if I'm rating (25:03 - 25:08)
with your community like it is a one-way (25:05 - 25:10)
it is a one-way communication there's (25:08 - 25:12)
one person that is speaking and the rest (25:10 - 25:14)
of us are either taking time to try to (25:12 - 25:17)
type fast on the separate device (25:14 - 25:19)
or just like I'm gonna trust that (25:17 - 25:21)
they're listening to the same thing I am (25:19 - 25:22)
and I'll make my decisions based off (25:21 - 25:24)
that because it is still a one-way (25:22 - 25:27)
broadcast and I I can do nothing to make (25:24 - 25:32)
this better but hope and that (25:27 - 25:34)
that is a frustrating frustrating (25:32 - 25:36)
frustrating experience if you're trying (25:34 - 25:39)
to do it on your own and you just want (25:36 - 25:40)
to get it done like I don't care I go (25:39 - 25:42)
into randoms I just goof around in (25:40 - 25:44)
randoms and if I do it I'll catch my (25:42 - 25:48)
Chestnut if we don't do it that was a (25:44 - 25:50)
interesting way to spend five minutes (25:48 - 25:51)
I'm seeing what people in the community (25:50 - 25:54)
are doing or in the case of the one raid (25:51 - 25:56)
seven and a half to eight minutes I lost (25:54 - 25:58)
track of time (25:56 - 25:59)
but (25:58 - 26:03)
for a lot of people who (25:59 - 26:07)
value their time more mainly adults or a (26:03 - 26:10)
lot of a lot of people who are (26:07 - 26:13)
you know want to get this one thing this (26:10 - 26:15)
one weekend this is a this is probably a (26:13 - 26:17)
very frustrating experience for them (26:15 - 26:19)
I know a person that I always relied on (26:17 - 26:22)
who was like would do every raid has (26:19 - 26:23)
reach out to be like I've not been doing (26:22 - 26:25)
them can you just give me an egg because (26:23 - 26:28)
I find them frustrating and I'm like yep (26:25 - 26:30)
I I no problem getting you eggs I (26:28 - 26:32)
understand like you didn't have time and (26:30 - 26:34)
it's too frustrating to try to do on (26:32 - 26:36)
your own (26:34 - 26:36)
either of you used the Nintendo (26:38 - 26:42)
communication mobile app that they made (26:41 - 26:47)
for Splatoon yep I used it once like the (26:42 - 26:49)
first week of I was I think it was (26:47 - 26:50)
Splatoon 2 right it launched what I (26:49 - 26:53)
think so I use it for Splatoon (26:50 - 26:57)
I used it for (26:53 - 26:57)
one other I don't remember I was (26:57 - 27:00)
immediately switched to Discord after (26:59 - 27:02)
like 10 minutes yeah that's not great (27:00 - 27:05)
yeah (27:02 - 27:05)
uh (27:06 - 27:09)
I was gonna say speaking of not great (27:09 - 27:12)
but these this announcement is pretty (27:11 - 27:14)
great uh new characters come into (27:12 - 27:18)
Pokemon unite yeah (27:14 - 27:22)
uh we have uh Umbreon Leafeon and (27:18 - 27:26)
intellion all coming to Pokemon unite uh (27:22 - 27:28)
this is off nintendoeverything.com (27:26 - 27:31)
Umbreon will arrive first on May 25th (27:28 - 27:35)
Leafeon will follow on June 8th (27:31 - 27:38)
and uh (27:35 - 27:41)
I don't think intellion has a date no (27:38 - 27:44)
everybody is (27:41 - 27:49)
assuming it is the last week of June (27:44 - 27:50)
yeah they usually do every like three (27:49 - 27:53)
weeks for a character right or yeah and (27:50 - 27:55)
so this the assumption is it'll be (27:53 - 28:00)
around June 23rd 20 somewhere in there (27:55 - 28:02)
um (28:00 - 28:07)
is also wild that we have (28:02 - 28:09)
We're not gonna have all the evolutions (28:07 - 28:12)
except for the Gen one the three engine (28:09 - 28:15)
one have not been touched there's no way (28:12 - 28:16)
they don't like do all three of those at (28:15 - 28:19)
the same time or or in a row well or (28:16 - 28:21)
something the thing is they're doing a (28:19 - 28:23)
big Eevee events so people are like (28:21 - 28:26)
that's what I would expect they're gonna (28:23 - 28:28)
do it they're not it's just it's just (28:26 - 28:31)
these five and we finally have a team of (28:28 - 28:32)
all five except (28:31 - 28:36)
you know we none of them are support (28:32 - 28:38)
um because Leafeon is supposed to be a (28:36 - 28:39)
Speedster (28:38 - 28:43)
it says uh the Eevee appeal or Rama Rama (28:39 - 28:46)
battles in which all players on both (28:43 - 28:48)
teams play as Eevee evolutions such as (28:46 - 28:50)
Espeon Umbreon Leafeon glacion and (28:48 - 28:52)
Sylveon while the Eevee will be (28:50 - 28:54)
scattered all over the map and a (28:52 - 28:56)
gigantomax Eevee will make its (28:54 - 28:57)
appearance that's really cool players (28:56 - 29:00)
can obtain prizes including unite (28:57 - 29:02)
license puzzle pieces which can be used (29:00 - 29:05)
to unlock licenses for Espeon glacion or (29:02 - 29:08)
Sylveon once 10 Pete puzzle pieces have (29:05 - 29:10)
been obtained this will start on May (29:08 - 29:13)
25th and go till June 23rd (29:10 - 29:15)
so this is like the Pikachu unite event (29:13 - 29:17)
where it was a giant Pikachu in the (29:15 - 29:18)
middle and everybody had to be Pikachu (29:17 - 29:21)
except everybody does have to be Evie (29:18 - 29:23)
but you can quickly evolve into (29:21 - 29:26)
differently I would absolutely expect (29:23 - 29:27)
all of the evolutions to be available (29:26 - 29:32)
for that event that's weird oh no (29:27 - 29:37)
cancel fans and Champs (29:32 - 29:37)
from what I know it's not a five team it (29:38 - 29:43)
is a four team (29:41 - 29:47)
for the Eevee Rama event because on (29:43 - 29:49)
brand will be released on May 25th when (29:47 - 29:52)
that starts so they didn't do five (29:49 - 29:56)
because when it starts you can only have (29:52 - 30:01)
four and then oh I see on June 8th the (29:56 - 30:03)
fifth gets released in the middle of the (30:01 - 30:05)
EV event but they're not (30:03 - 30:08)
gonna switch it to five uh so I think (30:05 - 30:12)
they just wait until Leafeon (30:08 - 30:16)
who knows who knows the decisions (30:12 - 30:19)
um yeah they this last patch if you're (30:16 - 30:21)
everybody who's reading about the last (30:19 - 30:24)
patch the last patch was very very bad (30:21 - 30:26)
um and they still haven't fixed sashian (30:24 - 30:28)
and they took away some things why would (30:26 - 30:30)
they need a fixation when they fixed (30:28 - 30:32)
comfy (30:30 - 30:36)
oh boy come face people are mad which (30:32 - 30:39)
granted comfy was really really broken (30:36 - 30:42)
but the bigger problem is still zashian (30:39 - 30:45)
I mean they sort of like (30:42 - 30:48)
they sort of nuked (30:45 - 30:51)
confey into the ground to deal with the (30:48 - 30:53)
zashian problem instead of fix exactly (30:51 - 30:57)
it right like Kofi paid the price for a (30:53 - 31:01)
section A little bit unfairly I think (30:57 - 31:04)
has this [ __ ] happened (31:01 - 31:07)
they just like burn it down burn that (31:04 - 31:09)
little thing to the ground I think I (31:07 - 31:10)
think if there's a Pokemon that would (31:09 - 31:14)
bring an influx of players either to the (31:10 - 31:16)
game or back to the game it would be (31:14 - 31:19)
Umbreon Umbreon Espeon are incredibly (31:16 - 31:21)
popular Eevee evolutions obviously (31:19 - 31:23)
Sylveon is also very popular Leafeon (31:21 - 31:26)
Iglesias are not very popular compared (31:23 - 31:29)
to the eight of them (31:26 - 31:31)
um (31:29 - 31:33)
again this is not me saying that I (31:31 - 31:35)
dislike Leafeon and glacion it is just (31:33 - 31:38)
the standard fact of when we rank all (31:35 - 31:40)
these EVS which we have multiple times (31:38 - 31:42)
and multiple websites have done (31:40 - 31:45)
usually Umbreon and Espeon are at the (31:42 - 31:46)
top (31:45 - 31:49)
the Kanto ones are in the middle and the (31:46 - 31:52)
Gen 4 ones are at the bottom it's just (31:49 - 31:56)
this usually how it goes yep (31:52 - 31:56)
with Sylvie on topping it on the top of (31:56 - 32:01)
the list pretty frequently at this (31:59 - 32:02)
pretty frequently yeah pretty frequently (32:01 - 32:05)
and Umbreon just everybody knows it's (32:02 - 32:07)
going to be a Defender (32:05 - 32:10)
so yeah was it was it do what what's (32:07 - 32:12)
what's its defense (32:10 - 32:14)
tactic (32:12 - 32:19)
moon in front of people yeah it uh (32:14 - 32:22)
summons Mercury Simon's murder cross (32:19 - 32:25)
around uh what all can it do I know we (32:22 - 32:27)
talked about this before (32:25 - 32:29)
um it's got super high one of the things (32:27 - 32:33)
the guys has got high defenses (32:29 - 32:37)
um it has an ability uh to steal shields (32:33 - 32:40)
uh as its ultimate so (32:37 - 32:44)
um for all of the shield users like (32:40 - 32:48)
Serena and Lapras and all those things (32:44 - 32:51)
uh it can steal those basically get rid (32:48 - 32:53)
of them but still doesn't get rid of the (32:51 - 32:55)
Rayquaza one (32:53 - 32:56)
um (32:55 - 32:59)
is it like a visual Shield it's stealing (32:56 - 33:01)
yeah so you can tell whenever it has a (32:59 - 33:02)
shield because it's got the ball around (33:01 - 33:05)
it so it takes takes it away (33:02 - 33:10)
um it's got mean look uh which uh (33:05 - 33:13)
traps the Pokemon into a Zone which I (33:10 - 33:14)
can't leave (33:13 - 33:17)
uh (33:14 - 33:17)
so uh (33:17 - 33:22)
that's a thing and I think if a brand is (33:20 - 33:26)
in that black Zone it's moves get (33:22 - 33:27)
boosted (33:26 - 33:28)
um (33:27 - 33:32)
and then it's got Foul Play which uh (33:28 - 33:33)
hits the Pokemon it decreases their (33:32 - 33:37)
movement speed uh and I think that one's (33:33 - 33:39)
uh one that can chain so you can hit a (33:37 - 33:41)
bunch of things it's got wish for (33:39 - 33:43)
recovery so you can make a wish to an (33:41 - 33:45)
ally Pokemon (33:43 - 33:46)
um (33:45 - 33:49)
it so it gets like it gets reduced (33:46 - 33:51)
damage and then heals I think and then (33:49 - 33:56)
it has snarl which uh uh decrease your (33:51 - 33:57)
special attack by negative one it (33:56 - 33:59)
decreases their attack special attack (33:57 - 34:02)
and movement speed (33:59 - 34:07)
uh it also gives Umbreon a shield (34:02 - 34:08)
um (34:07 - 34:11)
and then the Moonlight prances absorbs (34:08 - 34:13)
all the shields of opposing Pokemon and (34:11 - 34:16)
takes it to themselves so if it can hit (34:13 - 34:19)
right in the middle of a group that has (34:16 - 34:22)
Shields up it will take all those and (34:19 - 34:25)
put it around itself uh (34:22 - 34:27)
seems very situational it is very (34:25 - 34:30)
situational and apparently it doesn't (34:27 - 34:32)
work on the Rayquaza Shield which is a (34:30 - 34:34)
big bummer but if you do it before the (34:32 - 34:37)
Rayquaza Shield you'll win the Rayquaza (34:34 - 34:40)
possibly uh it's good like (34:37 - 34:44)
a brand is good because uh there are a (34:40 - 34:47)
few Shield users that make them (34:44 - 34:51)
incredibly difficult to take down and uh (34:47 - 34:55)
I think uh like (34:51 - 34:56)
has (34:55 - 35:00)
give Shields as one of the options uh (34:56 - 35:02)
which it would steal (35:00 - 35:07)
and I think oh does coffee do shields or (35:02 - 35:09)
is it just straight healing I don't (35:07 - 35:10)
remember (35:09 - 35:14)
if Flora healing does a shield (35:10 - 35:16)
uh yeah flower hilling does do a shield (35:14 - 35:19)
so it's also a way to steal like it's (35:16 - 35:21)
also a sort of way to deal with comfy (35:19 - 35:22)
like (35:21 - 35:24)
putting a shield up on something it (35:22 - 35:29)
jumps in and takes it which opens up a (35:24 - 35:30)
lot for (35:29 - 35:34)
damage so my compazation with with an (35:30 - 35:37)
Umbreon next to me can stub steal this (35:34 - 35:40)
Shield of your confidence yes (35:37 - 35:44)
finally we'll see how well it plays um (35:40 - 35:46)
it's gonna be tough to defeat and take (35:44 - 35:48)
down the reigning king of Defenders (35:46 - 35:50)
which is Lapras right now (35:48 - 35:53)
um Lapras is just literally everywhere (35:50 - 35:55)
everybody's literally because it's just (35:53 - 35:58)
slipping and sliding across that map (35:55 - 36:01)
boy that thing is tough to deal with (35:58 - 36:04)
both Lapras and gudra are so hard to (36:01 - 36:06)
take down because they heal themselves (36:04 - 36:08)
so much (36:06 - 36:10)
um but yeah we'll see how (36:08 - 36:14)
Umbreon if it comes in souped up uh I (36:10 - 36:16)
imagine that it will come into op like (36:14 - 36:18)
they always do especially starting the (36:16 - 36:20)
event you gotta sell those characters (36:18 - 36:22)
sell them characters that's how that (36:20 - 36:26)
works and then you Nerf them two weeks (36:22 - 36:29)
later yep except unless it's sashian and (36:26 - 36:30)
then you don't (36:29 - 36:33)
um the other thing that has changed is (36:30 - 36:35)
super competitive people if you're (36:33 - 36:36)
seeing us are complaining because you (36:35 - 36:40)
can no longer spy on the jump pad (36:36 - 36:42)
remotely (36:40 - 36:44)
so there was a thing competitors would (36:42 - 36:45)
do is you would as you were running (36:44 - 36:47)
there you would look over to see who's (36:45 - 36:50)
on their base and then who was going on (36:47 - 36:51)
jump in which they weighed they they (36:50 - 36:53)
were jumping because it helped you get (36:51 - 36:56)
Intel for positioning and that is no (36:53 - 36:58)
longer something people can see they (36:56 - 37:00)
remove that so a lot of competitors are (36:58 - 37:03)
really really really bad right now (37:00 - 37:06)
um that's like tier level play but it is (37:03 - 37:08)
believed it's changed because of (37:06 - 37:12)
potentially the sniping actions that (37:08 - 37:14)
intellion (37:12 - 37:14)
will be I like a true MOBA sniper who (37:19 - 37:27)
will have access to view the whole map (37:24 - 37:30)
and take shots at things that is all (37:27 - 37:32)
like there's people trying to piece (37:30 - 37:33)
together their decisions and what they (37:32 - 37:35)
would do because we the only other (37:33 - 37:38)
sniper that exists in game right now is (37:35 - 37:40)
decidueye (37:38 - 37:40)
um (37:40 - 37:42)
so they're sort of thinking like you (37:40 - 37:44)
know it's signature move a snapshot (37:42 - 37:46)
they're probably trying to deal with (37:44 - 37:48)
adding another sniper to the game but a (37:46 - 37:50)
lot of people are like really mad at (37:48 - 37:52)
unite right now because this patch (37:50 - 37:56)
this that last patch was pretty poor it (37:52 - 38:00)
just yeah I didn't see anyone excited (37:56 - 38:04)
and like they did weird Buffs like pyro (38:00 - 38:07)
ball cinderace got a buff for no reason (38:04 - 38:11)
like well nobody was complaining it was (38:07 - 38:13)
fine it wasn't great to have your (38:11 - 38:15)
popular starters always good right like (38:13 - 38:19)
Charizard has to always be good yeah (38:15 - 38:23)
centers was never bad it was never a bad (38:19 - 38:25)
thing not good enough (38:23 - 38:27)
Cinder is one of the easier ones to play (38:25 - 38:29)
it was just like you just point and (38:27 - 38:30)
shoot that's all you had to do there's (38:29 - 38:32)
not a lot going on there (38:30 - 38:35)
and it got a buff uh and then they just (38:32 - 38:38)
decided to buff the heck out of Glaceon (38:35 - 38:41)
why reasons (38:38 - 38:41)
sure cool I'm making up for diamond and (38:41 - 38:48)
purple brilliant diamond yeah apparently (38:44 - 38:50)
something had to (38:48 - 38:52)
uh all right well we will take a quick (38:50 - 38:55)
break uh when we come back we got uh a (38:52 - 38:58)
little bit more news so uh uh hold your (38:55 - 39:00)
horses hold your mud brace we'll be (38:58 - 39:04)
right back and we are back from our (39:00 - 39:05)
break (39:04 - 39:08)
the end of an era (39:05 - 39:11)
I don't know I actually how much this is (39:08 - 39:14)
this is our Pokemon Go News except not (39:11 - 39:17)
really about the game more about a (39:14 - 39:20)
community about the community I think (39:17 - 39:22)
it's important even if you don't play go (39:20 - 39:24)
um well I don't know important depending (39:22 - 39:27)
on how you view things (39:24 - 39:30)
on how much you paid attention to this (39:27 - 39:33)
side of Pokemon go yeah this is a very (39:30 - 39:36)
hardcore side of Pokemon go so we're (39:33 - 39:38)
talking about the Silph Road (39:36 - 39:40)
uh this is end of an era after seven (39:38 - 39:42)
extraordinary years the Silph Road team (39:40 - 39:44)
is ceasing operations thank you all for (39:42 - 39:46)
this remarkable Journey this was posted (39:44 - 39:48)
by uh I don't know how to say their name (39:46 - 39:53)
drops drops drawn no one else I say (39:48 - 39:55)
their name (39:53 - 39:58)
uh but anyways they they started the (39:55 - 40:00)
Silph Road uh before Pokemon go even (39:58 - 40:03)
came out the Silph Road was a website as (40:00 - 40:05)
they geared up for Pokemon go (40:03 - 40:08)
I met them at the uh first Pokemon go (40:05 - 40:09)
Fest I talked to them for a little bit (40:08 - 40:12)
I've saw them at I believe the second (40:09 - 40:15)
and third go Fest it was all in Chicago (40:12 - 40:16)
um (40:15 - 40:20)
and they make this post uh saying that (40:16 - 40:23)
uh exactly a year ago they decided to go (40:20 - 40:28)
with a sponsorship with Niantic (40:23 - 40:31)
um and Niantic would help pay for their (40:28 - 40:34)
cost of the Silph roads operation and (40:31 - 40:35)
because Niantic was paying for the cost (40:34 - 40:38)
the soap Road decided to remove all the (40:35 - 40:40)
ads from their website (40:38 - 40:42)
and (40:40 - 40:45)
uh they say all good things must come to (40:42 - 40:47)
an end niantic's sponsorship has been (40:45 - 40:50)
concluded it was exactly one year so (40:47 - 40:52)
that there was no surprise there if you (40:50 - 40:54)
look at their Post history they posted (40:52 - 40:56)
exactly one year ago announcing the (40:54 - 40:57)
Niantic thing and then it's been a year (40:56 - 40:59)
later and (40:57 - 41:01)
it was a year contract or I don't know (40:59 - 41:03)
contract is the right word but probably (41:01 - 41:06)
contractors contract yeah most things (41:03 - 41:08)
are contracts (41:06 - 41:09)
um (41:08 - 41:11)
and they said after considering the (41:09 - 41:13)
mounting Financial constraints facing (41:11 - 41:15)
our team along with the momentum and (41:13 - 41:18)
Landscape of the game in 2023 (41:15 - 41:20)
also I think on the podcast last week I (41:18 - 41:22)
said 2013 and neither of you corrected (41:20 - 41:27)
me I almost did I noticed for the record (41:22 - 41:31)
I I probably wasn't paying attention our (41:27 - 41:33)
team has come to the Bittersweet (41:31 - 41:37)
conclusion that uh it is time to close (41:33 - 41:39)
and (41:37 - 41:41)
so the Silph road is a couple things (41:39 - 41:43)
it's funny because I'm pretty sure last (41:41 - 41:45)
week when we talked about the Larvesta (41:43 - 41:46)
hatch rates I said we're reading this (41:45 - 41:48)
off the self Road website which no one (41:46 - 41:49)
ever goes to they just go to the (41:48 - 41:53)
subreddit and now the website is closing (41:49 - 41:57)
it was us we killed it I mean you go to (41:53 - 41:59)
the Silph Road for other things (41:57 - 42:00)
yes (41:59 - 42:02)
um I don't know if you use those other (42:00 - 42:05)
things Hannah they had like a nest Atlas (42:02 - 42:06)
they had (42:05 - 42:08)
um like a community map they had their (42:06 - 42:10)
little like (42:08 - 42:10)
into Community Days they also were the (42:13 - 42:19)
foundation of the Grassroots PVP which (42:16 - 42:22)
is what's really kind of shaking up a (42:19 - 42:23)
lot of the community behind the scenes (42:22 - 42:25)
there (42:23 - 42:26)
um well (42:25 - 42:27)
on a side note it doesn't matter how (42:26 - 42:29)
good your Grassroots are when the game (42:27 - 42:32)
itself is broken (42:29 - 42:32)
thorough they hosted a lot in their um (42:37 - 42:44)
end of an era post they can talk about (42:42 - 42:47)
they talk about how many PVP tournaments (42:44 - 42:50)
they hosted through Silph road and it (42:47 - 42:55)
was over 135 000 tournaments which is a (42:50 - 42:57)
lot yeah that's a lot (42:55 - 43:02)
uh as of this post uh 820 000 people are (42:57 - 43:05)
subscribed to the subreddit (43:02 - 43:07)
which is a lot (43:05 - 43:08)
um (43:07 - 43:10)
although in the the grand scheme of (43:08 - 43:12)
things (43:10 - 43:15)
800 000 is is a fraction of the Pokemon (43:12 - 43:19)
go player yeah it's tiny (43:15 - 43:19)
um (43:20 - 43:25)
so it (43:21 - 43:25)
it is to me like not surprising (43:26 - 43:33)
seven years is a long time people change (43:29 - 43:35)
they grow their life changes their (43:33 - 43:37)
interest changes their Hobbies change (43:35 - 43:39)
there there are always been people that (43:37 - 43:41)
like come to me and they're like I can't (43:39 - 43:43)
believe you've been doing this podcast (43:41 - 43:46)
for 12 some years or there or they'll (43:43 - 43:47)
say like you ever think you'll get sick (43:46 - 43:51)
of Pokemon like no no not yet I I I I I (43:47 - 43:53)
love it a lot I I don't think I'll ever (43:51 - 43:55)
get sick of it (43:53 - 43:57)
um unless Pikachu comes out as a bigot (43:55 - 43:58)
or something (43:57 - 44:01)
yeah boy (43:58 - 44:04)
I think I I will always like the series (44:01 - 44:06)
right Pikachu's a good guy though like (44:04 - 44:09)
he's you know he's reliable he's (44:06 - 44:13)
friendly he's electric he's (44:09 - 44:17)
out there doing things (44:13 - 44:19)
I think the thing that bothered me about (44:17 - 44:22)
reading this is (44:19 - 44:26)
that they had options they decided not (44:22 - 44:29)
to go with which yes (44:26 - 44:31)
is fine (44:29 - 44:34)
um but like if if the reason you're (44:31 - 44:36)
closing is like (44:34 - 44:39)
uh (44:36 - 44:39)
they say after considering the mounting (44:40 - 44:45)
Financial constraints facing our team (44:42 - 44:47)
which is money along with the momentum (44:45 - 44:49)
and Landscape of the game that's hey (44:47 - 44:50)
we're not happy with the game right now (44:49 - 44:52)
so we have two problems and that's why (44:50 - 44:54)
we're closing the first problem can be (44:52 - 44:57)
solved you went you went six years (44:54 - 44:59)
without niantic's money and you were (44:57 - 45:03)
running ads and you knew (44:59 - 45:05)
because it was a contract the end date (45:03 - 45:08)
of this yeah so you had plenty of time (45:05 - 45:11)
to either renegotiate another contract (45:08 - 45:13)
uh or which I don't think Niantic would (45:11 - 45:15)
have done because they're clearly moving (45:13 - 45:17)
everything over into campfire true true (45:15 - 45:20)
uh or you can restore the ads that you (45:17 - 45:22)
had back (45:20 - 45:24)
um which like I have to deal with (45:22 - 45:26)
contracts all the time right like I I (45:24 - 45:28)
have a I have a I have a contract with G (45:26 - 45:30)
fuel if they paid me every single month (45:28 - 45:33)
and I at this point I use that money to (45:30 - 45:35)
pay my electric bill so G fuel is (45:33 - 45:37)
keeping the lights on here which is very (45:35 - 45:39)
nice of them (45:37 - 45:41)
um and uh my contract with G feel is (45:39 - 45:42)
always six months (45:41 - 45:46)
and if you know in July when my contract (45:42 - 45:48)
renews if they decide not to because to (45:46 - 45:50)
and to be completely transparent there's (45:48 - 45:52)
a lot of companies I've been dealing (45:50 - 45:54)
with that they they don't want to they (45:52 - 45:55)
don't want to give money anymore like (45:54 - 45:58)
we're you know what some people believe (45:55 - 46:01)
we're about to hit a recession whatever (45:58 - 46:03)
um a lot of companies are saying hey (46:01 - 46:05)
uh maybe next year we can talk money (46:03 - 46:07)
again but this year we're you know (46:05 - 46:09)
tightening things up (46:07 - 46:11)
same for Niantic (46:09 - 46:11)
um (46:11 - 46:13)
like (46:11 - 46:15)
you're you're (46:13 - 46:16)
when your contract is over you either (46:15 - 46:18)
gotta really prove that you're worth (46:16 - 46:21)
that money or they have to prove to (46:18 - 46:23)
higher-ups that they can continue paying (46:21 - 46:25)
you that's whatever (46:23 - 46:28)
um but if they didn't want to go the ad (46:25 - 46:30)
route going back to the self-road I am (46:28 - 46:32)
sure they could have gone patreon they (46:30 - 46:35)
could have come uh Kofi what the coffee (46:32 - 46:38)
thing there's so many revenues they (46:35 - 46:43)
could have gone to I think solve the (46:38 - 46:46)
money problem of that (46:43 - 46:46)
which is maybe one of the reasons why (46:46 - 46:51)
the second half is so important the (46:48 - 46:54)
momentum and Landscape of the game (46:51 - 46:56)
and how much factored how much that (46:54 - 46:58)
factored in there's a couple of things (46:56 - 47:00)
whenever (46:58 - 47:00)
there's an oh there's like an old (47:01 - 47:05)
business wisdom that if a restaurant (47:02 - 47:07)
makes it past a year they're golden and (47:05 - 47:09)
if a restaurant closes after it's been (47:07 - 47:11)
open for a long time it's because they (47:09 - 47:12)
just don't want to do that restaurant (47:11 - 47:13)
anymore right (47:12 - 47:17)
I have a feeling that some of this is (47:13 - 47:21)
the people who are in charge also don't (47:17 - 47:23)
want to do this much anymore because if (47:21 - 47:27)
you made it seven years you can fix the (47:23 - 47:28)
money problems and it would be tough and (47:27 - 47:31)
it would be it would be a difficult (47:28 - 47:32)
transition but it's a transition that (47:31 - 47:35)
could happen if people who are running (47:32 - 47:38)
it were still invested in it (47:35 - 47:40)
um and so there's like two things I sort (47:38 - 47:41)
of look at this as well as one they may (47:40 - 47:43)
no longer be invested in the game (47:41 - 47:45)
anymore because the game it's seven (47:43 - 47:47)
years old and it's not that exciting for (47:45 - 47:49)
a lot of people (47:47 - 47:52)
you could also look at it like (47:49 - 47:54)
you can find other people that you trust (47:52 - 47:57)
to take over the Silph Road and say (47:54 - 47:58)
we're going to hand these off and they (47:57 - 48:01)
decided not to do that so there's like a (47:58 - 48:03)
temple of things that they aren't really (48:01 - 48:05)
talking about which is their prerogative (48:03 - 48:08)
that are just like unanswered questions (48:05 - 48:11)
like you have (48:08 - 48:13)
800 (48:11 - 48:14)
000 people (48:13 - 48:16)
there's got to be people that in that (48:14 - 48:20)
that you would have trusted to take over (48:16 - 48:23)
the Reddit side the research and things (48:20 - 48:26)
like that theoretically for now are (48:23 - 48:28)
going to continue on the Reddit side the (48:26 - 48:30)
posts are still going to happen yeah but (48:28 - 48:32)
I do think that this announcement has (48:30 - 48:35)
has had an impact a lot of people were (48:32 - 48:38)
pretty shocked by it yeah (48:35 - 48:40)
yeah I I think the thing that bothers me (48:38 - 48:42)
is like people blaming this on Niantic (48:40 - 48:45)
and I don't see how this is niantic's (48:42 - 48:48)
fault at all like they they opted to pay (48:45 - 48:50)
for their website which earned their (48:48 - 48:52)
cost and I don't know how much that is I (48:50 - 48:54)
have no clue how much that is uh my (48:52 - 48:56)
website's hosted on Squarespace I think (48:54 - 48:59)
it's like 260 a year and we run a (48:56 - 49:01)
Squarespace ad in the episode and that (48:59 - 49:03)
means they give us the every time we run (49:01 - 49:06)
a Squarespace ad that means they like (49:03 - 49:08)
pay for our year of Squarespace right (49:06 - 49:10)
like I don't I'm sure the Silph Road (49:08 - 49:12)
costs more than 260. I'm sure it costs (49:10 - 49:14)
more than 260 a year (49:12 - 49:17)
um but like (49:14 - 49:19)
they they knew what they signed they (49:17 - 49:21)
they signed a one-year deal they knew it (49:19 - 49:24)
was coming up they I I promise you that (49:21 - 49:27)
Niantic didn't like let them know two (49:24 - 49:28)
days before the end of the contract that (49:27 - 49:30)
they weren't renewing like they had (49:28 - 49:33)
options to go I do think this is more (49:30 - 49:36)
the people who are running this just (49:33 - 49:39)
don't care anymore and that is oh that (49:36 - 49:41)
is totally okay I don't know if it's (49:39 - 49:44)
just don't care it could also just be (49:41 - 49:47)
our frustrated and dissatisfied with the (49:44 - 49:49)
way the game is going yeah I don't know (49:47 - 49:51)
if you're like level like 37 in Pokemon (49:49 - 49:53)
go after seven years and you haven't (49:51 - 49:55)
posted on the sub you've posted twice on (49:53 - 49:57)
the subreddit in three years and you're (49:55 - 49:59)
supposed to be the dude running it I (49:57 - 50:01)
don't know if you care anymore (49:59 - 50:04)
he's he's literally 37 in the game yeah (50:01 - 50:07)
he's not 40. he's got it (50:04 - 50:10)
there's there's a lot to look at it (50:07 - 50:14)
um and it is like (50:10 - 50:14)
like thank you for your impact great (50:14 - 50:21)
you made the choice you are making the (50:19 - 50:24)
choice to end it there are other options (50:21 - 50:26)
but the choice that you all decided as a (50:24 - 50:28)
leadership team according to it was to (50:26 - 50:31)
and to take down the website which meant (50:28 - 50:33)
like you there's a couple of things in (50:31 - 50:35)
there you didn't want to do it anymore (50:33 - 50:38)
for your own reasons and you didn't (50:35 - 50:40)
I mean the last seven years he has two (50:38 - 50:42)
kids now yeah and you also didn't have (50:40 - 50:45)
anybody that you felt you trusted enough (50:42 - 50:46)
to hand it off to (50:45 - 50:48)
or just that the website features (50:46 - 50:51)
weren't as popular as or important as (50:48 - 50:53)
the the research that was happening on (50:51 - 50:54)
the subreddit because the website (50:53 - 50:57)
features were really cool but also I (50:54 - 50:58)
didn't know very many people who use (50:57 - 51:00)
them right like you're paying for (50:58 - 51:02)
something and you can go in there and (51:00 - 51:05)
check the raid info and that was super (51:02 - 51:07)
helpful or you would go and just check (51:05 - 51:09)
something for a couple of seconds and (51:07 - 51:11)
that would be super helpful but there (51:09 - 51:13)
was a lot there were a lot of really (51:11 - 51:15)
thorough features on the website that (51:13 - 51:18)
were not used all that much (51:15 - 51:21)
yeah yeah I I think the handing it off (51:18 - 51:23)
is hard (51:21 - 51:25)
um and not not because of the the the (51:23 - 51:26)
the (51:25 - 51:30)
ropes dude but like when I was doing the (51:26 - 51:31)
carve (51:30 - 51:33)
uh which was my monster hunter podcast (51:31 - 51:35)
there was a point where I was I was just (51:33 - 51:38)
too busy I it's I'm like I don't think I (51:35 - 51:40)
was doing a good job to the listeners of (51:38 - 51:41)
the carve because I couldn't play as (51:40 - 51:43)
much as I wanted to I didn't have time (51:41 - 51:46)
to sit down and like really research (51:43 - 51:49)
more complicated mechanics to feel (51:46 - 51:51)
confident about talking about it and so (51:49 - 51:53)
what I was saying when I was like okay I (51:51 - 51:56)
like I can't do the carve as well as I (51:53 - 51:58)
should be able to and I went to at the (51:56 - 52:02)
time it was Micah and I was like hey man (51:58 - 52:05)
I'm gonna be really busy like I know I (52:02 - 52:06)
know you know we started this thing (52:05 - 52:09)
together would you like to you know take (52:06 - 52:13)
it and here's all the assets here's all (52:09 - 52:14)
the audio files here's the website (52:13 - 52:15)
here's the email (52:14 - 52:17)
uh you can do whatever you want with it (52:15 - 52:19)
and he was like nope I he's like I don't (52:17 - 52:21)
want to do any of that work he's like I (52:19 - 52:23)
just wanted to show up and talk yep and (52:21 - 52:25)
I was like okay like who am I gonna find (52:23 - 52:29)
to like host it edit it like do the (52:25 - 52:31)
social media and then when when will (52:29 - 52:34)
decided to come on it was kind of the (52:31 - 52:36)
same conversation like sword and shield (52:34 - 52:38)
were gearing up and coming out I was (52:36 - 52:40)
like I'm gonna be really busy will and I (52:38 - 52:42)
was like you were playing Monster Hunter (52:40 - 52:43)
every day (52:42 - 52:45)
and (52:43 - 52:47)
I said the same thing to will I was like (52:45 - 52:51)
do you want okay he will he was already (52:47 - 52:52)
editing and doing podcasts so at least (52:51 - 52:55)
you know he he had that under his belt I (52:52 - 52:57)
was like do you want to take over the (52:55 - 52:59)
carve and he said the same thing he was (52:57 - 53:00)
like nope I don't want that (52:59 - 53:02)
responsibility and I would not be (53:00 - 53:04)
surprised if it was the same thing here (53:02 - 53:07)
where where he went to people and was (53:04 - 53:08)
like hey do you want to take this over (53:07 - 53:11)
and they're like no that's way too much (53:08 - 53:13)
work they're all because there are (53:11 - 53:14)
probably people on that subreddit that (53:13 - 53:15)
love the Silph Road and they're probably (53:14 - 53:18)
like I'm okay with like my one Deep dive (53:15 - 53:21)
analysis once a month yeah that's my (53:18 - 53:22)
contribution I don't want to do anything (53:21 - 53:24)
more and I respect that I get it yeah (53:22 - 53:27)
it's a lot of work to yep like there are (53:24 - 53:29)
PVP people on the Silph road I don't (53:27 - 53:31)
read those posts because I don't care (53:29 - 53:32)
but when I click on them and they're (53:31 - 53:35)
like they're like longer than the Bible (53:32 - 53:37)
I'm like man you put a lot of work into (53:35 - 53:40)
this that's awesome I ain't reading it (53:37 - 53:42)
but like I got a huge respect that (53:40 - 53:44)
you've calculated what alolan executor (53:42 - 53:47)
can do against like a Chimchar in a raid (53:44 - 53:48)
like that's awesome man but that ain't (53:47 - 53:50)
for me (53:48 - 53:50)
um but but in no way is like the people (53:52 - 53:57)
that are like this is niantic's Fault (53:55 - 53:59)
like what no this is (53:57 - 54:01)
not like if that if that is your take (53:59 - 54:03)
away from this whole post like you were (54:01 - 54:05)
under your contract the one-year (54:03 - 54:07)
contract definitely seems like it was (54:05 - 54:09)
they could tell they knew it was going (54:07 - 54:11)
to be a one-year contract the Niantic (54:09 - 54:13)
was spinning up campfire campfire it was (54:11 - 54:16)
clearly something that this was going to (54:13 - 54:18)
feed into that their contract was (54:16 - 54:22)
revolving around the communities and (54:18 - 54:24)
starting working with the community (54:22 - 54:27)
programs which was then what campfire (54:24 - 54:29)
was made for and they are very (54:27 - 54:31)
thoroughly pushing campfire with their (54:29 - 54:34)
new game yes they sure are (54:31 - 54:37)
it's interesting because I think the (54:34 - 54:40)
other thing that I will (54:37 - 54:43)
I do think Niantic can be held (54:40 - 54:47)
accountable for was using a third party (54:43 - 54:50)
to buy them time (54:47 - 54:53)
to and and using somebody else to sort (54:50 - 54:55)
of figure out how they wanted their (54:53 - 54:58)
product to do right like yeah they they (54:55 - 55:01)
that that is kind of a not a business (54:58 - 55:02)
practice that I'm not particularly happy (55:01 - 55:04)
that people do all the time it's like (55:02 - 55:07)
running art contests you know at least (55:04 - 55:10)
they paid them but like there was money (55:07 - 55:11)
that exchanged hands yeah yeah I mean (55:10 - 55:14)
you were doing you're doing this to buy (55:11 - 55:18)
yourself time to eventually cut them out (55:14 - 55:21)
and like that is not a great I don't (55:18 - 55:23)
really love that part of capitalism but (55:21 - 55:26)
that is a known part of capitalism so I (55:23 - 55:27)
I will say like (55:26 - 55:30)
on Niantic Park I do find that those (55:27 - 55:32)
sort of business practices while common (55:30 - 55:36)
slightly Shady but I don't think they (55:32 - 55:38)
were (55:36 - 55:40)
I don't think they really hid that fact (55:38 - 55:43)
like I don't think that was a hidden (55:40 - 55:45)
goal of theirs (55:43 - 55:48)
uh when you sign up when your contract (55:45 - 55:49)
and you're like we're gonna start this (55:48 - 55:50)
ambassador program and we're also going (55:49 - 55:52)
to be doing campfire and we're going to (55:50 - 55:53)
be doing all these things like it wasn't (55:52 - 55:57)
particularly hidden I I agree that it's (55:53 - 56:00)
not the best thing for companies to do (55:57 - 56:03)
but it is a pretty standard business (56:00 - 56:05)
practice so like (56:03 - 56:09)
hate capitalism more than hate Niantic (56:05 - 56:14)
yeah I mean like unlike an art contest (56:09 - 56:18)
there was money right right (56:14 - 56:18)
okay do a bunch of art we'll only pick (56:18 - 56:23)
three of you but we know that at least (56:21 - 56:28)
30 000 will apply and to help out yeah (56:23 - 56:28)
yeah I I (56:28 - 56:32)
I I have no proof but I strongly suspect (56:32 - 56:38)
that they probably tried to hand this (56:36 - 56:40)
off to somebody and they just couldn't (56:38 - 56:44)
find anyone that wanted to take so many (56:40 - 56:47)
responsibilities on (56:44 - 56:50)
um as well as like a cost thing (56:47 - 56:52)
and again I think they could have done (56:50 - 56:55)
this like they could have restored the (56:52 - 56:58)
ads maybe said a patreon is coming and (56:55 - 57:00)
you'll get like a bonus badge on like (56:58 - 57:01)
the subreddit or something right like (57:00 - 57:04)
they could have set up a situation where (57:01 - 57:06)
like okay the money thing is going to be (57:04 - 57:08)
taken care of but (57:06 - 57:09)
um (57:08 - 57:11)
these are all the like the the (57:09 - 57:13)
maintenance things that you have to do (57:11 - 57:15)
on the website or the subreddit and like (57:13 - 57:18)
that is just that is probably (57:15 - 57:21)
an 80 hour work week for so for one (57:18 - 57:23)
person yeah (57:21 - 57:23)
it's a low-paying part-time job (57:24 - 57:31)
[Laughter] (57:28 - 57:31)
I mean (57:33 - 57:38)
I mean you know some things can be (57:36 - 57:41)
part-time but I mean when often people (57:38 - 57:45)
are like oh you know there's no money in (57:41 - 57:47)
X like people ask me all the time why (57:45 - 57:49)
aren't you why don't you just not take (57:47 - 57:53)
another job and just write RPGs (57:49 - 57:55)
and make that content yeah because DND (57:53 - 57:58)
patreon going Greg like because there's (57:55 - 58:02)
not enough money in it like it's a good (57:58 - 58:07)
side Hustle but not (58:02 - 58:09)
I do not I would have to have so many (58:07 - 58:13)
things on all the time and be making so (58:09 - 58:15)
many deals and so many other things or I (58:13 - 58:17)
can just get a full-time job (58:15 - 58:20)
and do it in my spare time when I am (58:17 - 58:22)
ready to make that like switching this (58:20 - 58:24)
there is so much work that goes into a (58:22 - 58:26)
lot of these things that people already (58:24 - 58:28)
undervalue like you don't understand (58:26 - 58:32)
like if a corporation hired a person to (58:28 - 58:34)
do that much work it's a full-time job (58:32 - 58:36)
with a salary and most of your patreon (58:34 - 58:39)
cash aren't doing it like you're not (58:36 - 58:41)
gonna get there (58:39 - 58:45)
it is never as easy as (58:41 - 58:48)
people think it is like monetary reasons (58:45 - 58:50)
also means people should be compensated (58:48 - 58:53)
for their time spent doing it and most (58:50 - 58:55)
people aren't willing to compensate (58:53 - 58:57)
people for that time (58:55 - 58:59)
like I'm about to crowdfund another game (58:57 - 59:01)
and people are like well how much are (58:59 - 59:03)
you paying yourself I'm like zero I am (59:01 - 59:06)
paying myself zero I have to pay (59:03 - 59:08)
everybody else who's done work for me (59:06 - 59:11)
first and generally I don't make money (59:08 - 59:16)
on this until much much much later (59:11 - 59:16)
like I'm barely now turning a profit on (59:19 - 59:26)
glitter Hearts this has been three years (59:22 - 59:26)
um (59:28 - 59:31)
I don't know how much will change in the (59:32 - 59:39)
sense of the subreddit itself (59:35 - 59:42)
I think you will still see the people (59:39 - 59:44)
reporting like New Zealand's broken (59:42 - 59:46)
again I think you will still see the (59:44 - 59:50)
Larvesta is 0.8 percent in eggs right (59:46 - 59:52)
like those those things weren't being (59:50 - 59:56)
done by the top people of the Silph road (59:52 - 59:57)
because they were doing other things (59:56 - 59:58)
like (59:57 - 60:00)
I think you will still see those long (59:58 - 60:03)
Bible verses of PVP stuff (60:00 - 60:06)
um but but just like anything else they (60:03 - 60:10)
can disappear because like think of uh (60:06 - 60:14)
think of like leak duck like he could (60:10 - 60:17)
just stop doing Graphics (60:14 - 60:20)
linkedin's website is also great (60:17 - 60:22)
so if you were using the self road you (60:20 - 60:25)
can check out leakeduck's website too (60:22 - 60:28)
yeah like (60:25 - 60:28)
I mean Serebii could just say I'm done (60:28 - 60:33)
at any moment (60:31 - 60:35)
that's true but he could say I'm done (60:33 - 60:37)
and then cash in a giant paycheck (60:35 - 60:40)
because literally there are there are (60:37 - 60:41)
big (60:40 - 60:45)
I can't even say it's conglomerates yes (60:41 - 60:47)
there are big websites that will buy (60:45 - 60:51)
that website up in a heartbeat oh yeah (60:47 - 60:52)
um that's what actually happened to (60:51 - 60:54)
Maryland at one point is a big website (60:52 - 60:56)
came in and they bought Maryland and (60:54 - 60:58)
Maryland (60:56 - 61:01)
decided a couple years later that he (60:58 - 61:02)
wanted to start over and (61:01 - 61:05)
he had to because he technically sold (61:02 - 61:07)
his website to somebody else so he had (61:05 - 61:08)
to start over (61:07 - 61:09)
um (61:08 - 61:11)
who knows if that was the right decision (61:09 - 61:12)
but it was probably the right decision (61:11 - 61:15)
for him at the time (61:12 - 61:16)
um (61:15 - 61:18)
anyways uh (61:16 - 61:19)
so yeah (61:18 - 61:21)
um (61:19 - 61:21)
I will we'll see I I don't think (61:22 - 61:28)
we'll see how much of an impact it'll (61:26 - 61:29)
have but I do think that the (61:28 - 61:33)
announcement itself had a morale impact (61:29 - 61:36)
on players who knew of the Silph Road (61:33 - 61:39)
yeah I agree I agree (61:36 - 61:42)
I think it was like another uh (61:39 - 61:44)
another after the tick for some season (61:42 - 61:47)
after the whole raid pass thing after (61:44 - 61:49)
the way the events have just been bad (61:47 - 61:52)
and boring (61:49 - 61:52)
I don't know I I think I said this last (61:53 - 61:57)
time I love Pokemon go I have loved (61:55 - 61:59)
Pokemon go and the community it has (61:57 - 62:01)
brought but I'm not (61:59 - 62:03)
happy with how it's going I'm not sure (62:01 - 62:06)
where it's going from here (62:03 - 62:06)
apparently uh uh (62:10 - 62:16)
uh a Niantic event in Seattle there was (62:12 - 62:19)
pictures of Korea I was not invited for (62:16 - 62:22)
the record I will I I am in the nine to (62:19 - 62:23)
create a group we've talked about this (62:22 - 62:25)
before (62:23 - 62:26)
didn't even know it was happening I (62:25 - 62:28)
wasn't invited probably because I say (62:26 - 62:31)
things that Niantic does not like and uh (62:28 - 62:33)
it you know (62:31 - 62:36)
uh you know we've seen creators get on (62:33 - 62:38)
the naughty list for Niantic you know (62:36 - 62:41)
remember when trainer tips did a whole (62:38 - 62:44)
dragon Pokemon Go YouTube video and then (62:41 - 62:46)
all of a sudden trainer tips was not (62:44 - 62:49)
invited to the next go Fest (62:46 - 62:51)
uh (62:49 - 62:53)
I don't know again I don't know maybe (62:51 - 62:55)
maybe they just didn't have the budget (62:53 - 62:57)
maybe I maybe they're showing features (62:55 - 62:59)
that I wouldn't use anyways I don't know (62:57 - 63:01)
why I wasn't invited it's okay it's not (62:59 - 63:03)
that big of a deal (63:01 - 63:06)
Chestnut dramatically more important for (63:03 - 63:10)
me I love the chestnut get that good (63:06 - 63:14)
Paladin but uh I know there was a (63:10 - 63:16)
handful of creators that went out to (63:14 - 63:18)
Seattle to see some new features and (63:16 - 63:20)
they said they can't talk about it I I (63:18 - 63:22)
have no clue what it is I mean there's (63:20 - 63:23)
been rumors of what new features are (63:22 - 63:25)
coming right like one of the rumors is (63:23 - 63:28)
Shadow raids I think uh and then the (63:25 - 63:29)
routes (63:28 - 63:30)
um (63:29 - 63:32)
thing has been rumored forever routes (63:30 - 63:35)
technically exist in Ingress so like (63:32 - 63:37)
that wouldn't be a surprise to anyone (63:35 - 63:39)
who was like if you haven't heard I (63:37 - 63:40)
think rats have been rumored for like (63:39 - 63:44)
what like two or three years (63:40 - 63:44)
uh I think in Ingress a route from what (63:46 - 63:52)
I remember is ideally when you get to (63:49 - 63:54)
like a big city well this only benefits (63:52 - 63:56)
people in big cities (63:54 - 63:59)
um it will take you from one place to (63:56 - 64:03)
another to let you explore that City and (63:59 - 64:05)
then because you're following a specific (64:03 - 64:06)
route (64:05 - 64:10)
in the city uh you would get a reward at (64:06 - 64:13)
the end so it's kind of like you know in (64:10 - 64:15)
in Zelda or whatever when you're doing (64:13 - 64:17)
Mission from point A to point B and then (64:15 - 64:18)
because you did them all you get (64:17 - 64:20)
something at the very end right it's (64:18 - 64:23)
supposed to be like that IRL now (64:20 - 64:24)
as I explained that that probably sounds (64:23 - 64:27)
very cool to people it exists in Ingress (64:24 - 64:29)
and it I think people like it in Ingress (64:27 - 64:33)
but again if you live in you know (64:29 - 64:35)
Appleton Wisconsin (64:33 - 64:38)
you're not using that feature I'm not (64:35 - 64:39)
even sure the city I live in would get (64:38 - 64:41)
that feature I feel like that's the kind (64:39 - 64:42)
of thing that would only come to the (64:41 - 64:45)
biggest cities yeah yeah but you know if (64:42 - 64:47)
you're traveling to Paris for the first (64:45 - 64:49)
time and you've never been (64:47 - 64:52)
that's a cool way to explore that city (64:49 - 64:55)
is like I I have personally said on this (64:52 - 64:58)
podcast I use Pokemon go to pick a (64:55 - 65:00)
direction in a new city to walk to (64:58 - 65:02)
because I know like if I look at the (65:00 - 65:03)
Pokemon go map and I see a bunch of (65:02 - 65:06)
spots stops North and I see nothing (65:03 - 65:07)
South (65:06 - 65:12)
North seems like the better option (65:07 - 65:12)
[Laughter] (65:12 - 65:16)
um so yeah I I have no clue what was (65:14 - 65:18)
shown I I (65:16 - 65:20)
I don't know why I wasn't invited not (65:18 - 65:23)
that big of a deal though but I I wish I (65:20 - 65:25)
could come on the show and be like hey (65:23 - 65:27)
Niantic showed some cool stuff be (65:25 - 65:30)
excited this year (65:27 - 65:30)
on the audio podcast I'm making some (65:30 - 65:35)
weird faces I don't know (65:33 - 65:39)
[Music] (65:35 - 65:39)
something so yeah hopefully it's good (65:39 - 65:42)
stuff (65:41 - 65:44)
uh speaking of good stuff uh Pokemon (65:42 - 65:47)
Masters uh added Cigna suit Ace Rolla (65:44 - 65:49)
and tapu bulu and then (65:47 - 65:53)
um Lana and tapu Finney (65:49 - 65:57)
I believe were also just added (65:53 - 65:59)
uh that's it you know Pokemon Master's (65:57 - 66:01)
still adding new stuff uh we're probably (65:59 - 66:05)
not going to hear too much for another (66:01 - 66:05)
two months I think is then the the (66:05 - 66:10)
anniversary yep (66:08 - 66:13)
uh everybody says that bulu is worth (66:10 - 66:17)
pulling for uh but I keep in mind that (66:13 - 66:19)
there's going to be a big event coming (66:17 - 66:21)
up too so you might want to also hold on (66:19 - 66:23)
to your gems yeah it kind of depends on (66:21 - 66:25)
what you want to do yeah um (66:23 - 66:29)
or how caught up with you on the gotcha (66:25 - 66:31)
experience you are whether (66:29 - 66:33)
I don't know I don't know what would be (66:31 - 66:36)
uh exciting for I think this would be a (66:33 - 66:39)
three year anniversary yeah (66:36 - 66:39)
um (66:39 - 66:44)
oh I think you're right I think it is (66:41 - 66:46)
you know it is yeah (66:44 - 66:48)
so it would be (66:46 - 66:50)
um gosh I can't remember like who's the (66:48 - 66:52)
exciting repeats (66:50 - 66:55)
how many cynthias (66:52 - 66:57)
we'll get Ash with Charizard because (66:55 - 66:59)
everybody has to have a Charizard (66:57 - 67:01)
oh they could bring back Ash and Pikachu (66:59 - 67:03)
they haven't that would that could be (67:01 - 67:05)
recycled yeah (67:03 - 67:07)
uh I mean they'll probably do a bunch of (67:05 - 67:10)
the Cigna suit stuff leading up to it (67:07 - 67:12)
like they always do so we might get Leon (67:10 - 67:14)
and turn us back (67:12 - 67:14)
um you know we might get Ash and Pikachu (67:16 - 67:22)
and Leon and Charizard (67:19 - 67:26)
closer yeah to the this is a good (67:22 - 67:29)
transition closer to when the episodes (67:26 - 67:32)
finally air (67:29 - 67:33)
in (67:32 - 67:37)
America which is on starting June 23rd (67:33 - 67:39)
tune in to see Ash battle Leon in the (67:37 - 67:41)
master well they just they just go ahead (67:39 - 67:43)
and spoil that whole thing or I guess it (67:41 - 67:44)
doesn't matter (67:43 - 67:46)
and it's already been spoiled it's (67:44 - 67:50)
already there it's like come on part (67:46 - 67:52)
three coming to Netflix (67:50 - 67:56)
this is off pokemon.com don't even watch (67:52 - 67:57)
our anime (67:56 - 67:59)
here's just everything that happened (67:57 - 68:02)
yeah (67:59 - 68:02)
the master AIDS tournament is underway (68:03 - 68:08)
in this collection of 15 episodes come (68:05 - 68:10)
together with Ash and Pikachu as they (68:08 - 68:12)
face some of their toughest opponents (68:10 - 68:14)
ever this all leads to Ash's dramatic (68:12 - 68:17)
battle against The Gather Champion Leon (68:14 - 68:20)
for the title of world champion so that (68:17 - 68:25)
will start in about a month on Netflix (68:20 - 68:25)
which you know look you know Batman's (68:25 - 68:30)
gonna win at the end of the movie you (68:28 - 68:32)
know that uh (68:30 - 68:35)
depends if there's a part two (68:32 - 68:38)
yeah if if we didn't know the ending if (68:35 - 68:40)
we didn't know that the next season of (68:38 - 68:42)
the Pokemon anime wasn't going to have (68:40 - 68:45)
Ash as the main character (68:42 - 68:45)
um (68:45 - 68:47)
you could still question whether you (68:45 - 68:49)
would win but (68:47 - 68:53)
but all the answers are right here (68:49 - 68:57)
on the website they've already stated (68:53 - 69:00)
you know we were debating whether or not (68:57 - 69:02)
they would continue with Ash (69:00 - 69:04)
and I think of this show I definitely (69:02 - 69:06)
said there's no way they get rid of Ash (69:04 - 69:09)
this is a worst time (69:06 - 69:12)
not only are we getting rid of them (69:09 - 69:15)
but we're just gonna tell you how it (69:12 - 69:17)
ends (69:15 - 69:19)
oh boy (69:17 - 69:22)
you don't get the satisfaction we're (69:19 - 69:25)
just gonna drip that from your hands you (69:22 - 69:29)
don't deserve it you've been bad people (69:25 - 69:29)
oh boy well you know hey that's coming (69:29 - 69:35)
to Netflix so I think uh gosh it would (69:32 - 69:37)
probably be around October we would (69:35 - 69:40)
finally get to see the uh (69:37 - 69:43)
the new anime maybe they'll hold off (69:40 - 69:45)
until november-ish or whenever maybe (69:43 - 69:47)
they'll release the first part of the (69:45 - 69:51)
DLC around the time yeah yeah yeah (69:47 - 69:52)
I mean that would be nice to be playing (69:51 - 69:54)
the DLC and being able to watch it it's (69:52 - 69:55)
it's (69:54 - 69:56)
gosh at this point it's hard to even (69:55 - 69:58)
click on cerebii and like scroll down (69:56 - 70:00)
and look at news and be like oh well I (69:58 - 70:02)
guess that's happening in the new anime (70:00 - 70:04)
great cool I'll wait another 18 months (70:02 - 70:06)
to see that happen yeah there's some (70:04 - 70:08)

uh Milwaukee regionals was like 84 to (71:59 - 72:05)
compete in the video game I'm assuming (72:02 - 72:06)
is probably the same price if not a (72:05 - 72:08)
little bit higher here for NAIC (72:06 - 72:12)
if you don't want to compete which I (72:08 - 72:15)
don't blame you and you just want to go (72:12 - 72:18)

really great if you saw the Pokemon (73:54 - 73:59)
pop-up Center in London or in Melbourne (73:55 - 74:03)
Melbourne Australia uh it was very like (73:59 - 74:06)

Steakhouse right 2013 Ruth's Ruth's (74:20 - 74:27)
Steakhouse look (74:24 - 74:29)
you know Chris isn't as great as Ruth (74:27 - 74:30)
yeah (74:29 - 74:32)
I actually did do the research as to why (74:30 - 74:34)
it's called that so if you if you want (74:32 - 74:37)
to know why you can hit me up okay uh (74:34 - 74:38)
attendees can also participate in the (74:37 - 74:41)
play lab uh which is they've been doing (74:38 - 74:42)
these at like I think there was one at (74:41 - 74:44)
Pax I think they did one at Gen Con one (74:42 - 74:46)
year (74:44 - 74:49)
um these are the Hands-On we'll teach (74:46 - 74:51)
you TCG we'll give you a couple free (74:49 - 74:53)
booster packs for playing (74:51 - 74:54)
um you don't need a badge for that (74:53 - 74:57)
either I'm pretty sure they had that pop (74:54 - 75:01)
up at the Pokemon regionals (74:57 - 75:01)
probably all of the Regionals (75:02 - 75:08)
um so yeah uh this is this is a lot you (75:05 - 75:10)
know people always ask like hey there's (75:08 - 75:13)
Originals in Daytona Beach I'm from (75:10 - 75:15)
Miami should I drive out there and I'm (75:13 - 75:17)
always like ah you know (75:15 - 75:19)
usually there's a couple of vendors you (75:17 - 75:21)
know they're kind of overpriced but you (75:19 - 75:23)
get to be around Pokemon people (75:21 - 75:27)
sometimes there's like Pokemon Go stuff (75:23 - 75:29)
on North America an international (75:27 - 75:31)
championships you know if you're I mean (75:29 - 75:33)
an hour or two away I think it's a (75:31 - 75:35)
hundred percent worth going as a Pokemon (75:33 - 75:37)
fan (75:35 - 75:39)
um obviously the more Pokemon you like (75:37 - 75:41)
the better but I (75:39 - 75:45)
you know Pokemon go in the area the (75:41 - 75:47)
Pokemon pop-up Center (75:45 - 75:49)
um (75:47 - 75:53)
watching matches I I do think that this (75:49 - 75:55)
is probably worth a I I don't know if (75:53 - 75:58)
it's worth like a plane ticket and you (75:55 - 76:01)
know a hotel if uh if you're just (75:58 - 76:04)
spectating but uh to anyone in Ohio if (76:01 - 76:06)
you are within driving distance I I (76:04 - 76:09)
think this is worth visiting for sure (76:06 - 76:11)
um and we're not getting a worlds in (76:09 - 76:14)
America this year so uh (76:11 - 76:16)
if you need that Pokemon in person itch (76:14 - 76:20)
you don't have a lot of options (76:16 - 76:22)
don't go fast (76:20 - 76:22)
it'll still go fast (76:23 - 76:25)
for a bare minimum of a hundred dollars (76:26 - 76:31)
for your weekend that'll at least get (76:28 - 76:36)
you the ticket not a minimum tickets 25. (76:31 - 76:36)
uh I will be at the North American (76:39 - 76:43)
International Championship you know I (76:41 - 76:44)
was going to go to the Milwaukee one (76:43 - 76:47)
because it's about five hour drive but I (76:44 - 76:48)
found out my hair stylist in Milwaukee (76:47 - 76:53)
who I love dearly she's fantastic uh so (76:48 - 76:55)
selfish of her apparently she's having (76:53 - 76:57)
another baby so (76:55 - 77:01)
is Pokemon and Pokemon was worth it with (76:57 - 77:03)
a possibility of a haircut but no (77:01 - 77:05)
haircut (77:03 - 77:06)
I don't know if Pokemon's worth it at (77:05 - 77:09)
that point (77:06 - 77:09)
it's not worth a five hour drive for (77:09 - 77:15)
Pokemon that's where we've gotten too (77:13 - 77:19)
but you throw it on a haircut a good (77:15 - 77:21)
haircut and I'm in (77:19 - 77:23)
um (77:21 - 77:25)
uh so yeah I'm still on the fence about (77:23 - 77:27)
Milwaukee now (77:25 - 77:30)
when is the Milwaukee when is it uh end (77:27 - 77:32)
of this month two weeks (77:30 - 77:33)
yeah I went to the very end of the (77:32 - 77:35)
Portland regionals (77:33 - 77:37)
wish I had gotten to go there earlier (77:35 - 77:39)
and actually met some of the people who (77:37 - 77:41)
were there who I would be interested in (77:39 - 77:43)
kind of hanging out with ultimately how (77:41 - 77:45)
much I wanted (77:43 - 77:47)
spectator bad spectator ticket was five (77:45 - 77:48)
dollars (77:47 - 77:50)
well it was only five dollars for you (77:48 - 77:52)
yeah participation was it a one day or (77:50 - 77:54)
was it a week was it a weekend I think (77:52 - 77:56)
there was only one option so I think (77:54 - 77:59)
that it was for the full weekend hmm I (77:56 - 78:00)
think when I was looking at Milwaukee it (77:59 - 78:04)
was like 11. weird (78:00 - 78:04)
uh you had to compete in Milwaukee was I (78:06 - 78:11)
think it was like 80 bucks it was like (78:09 - 78:13)
uh five hours (78:11 - 78:17)
I had considered trying (78:13 - 78:17)
this time around but I I'm not good (78:18 - 78:22)
enough for seventy dollars to be worth (78:21 - 78:25)
it yeah that's crazy because (78:22 - 78:28)
um I almost did the Pokemon go last year (78:25 - 78:30)
in Milwaukee (78:28 - 78:32)
because I just (78:30 - 78:35)
it was faster yeah like matches are much (78:32 - 78:38)
quicker uh the the structure is a lot (78:35 - 78:40)
quicker (78:38 - 78:43)
um and then it's just like it's so hard (78:40 - 78:45)
maybe this goes maybe the self-road (78:43 - 78:47)
closing is a bad thing it's so hard for (78:45 - 78:48)
somebody who (78:47 - 78:51)
wants to maybe compete and then to be (78:48 - 78:53)
hit with that price tag yeah like I get (78:51 - 78:56)
that there are rewards at the end and it (78:53 - 78:59)
pays for the rewards like booster boxes (78:56 - 79:01)
and prize money and travel stipends I (78:59 - 79:03)
totally understand that (79:01 - 79:04)
um (79:03 - 79:06)
I guess maybe that's where it is just to (79:04 - 79:09)
compete yeah (79:06 - 79:11)
and there's nothing wrong with being (79:09 - 79:13)
like I know I'm not good but the only (79:11 - 79:15)
way I'm gonna get better is by (79:13 - 79:17)
participating (79:15 - 79:19)
but that's still a lot of money to be (79:17 - 79:21)
like I know I'm not gonna walk away with (79:19 - 79:24)
anything except it's like ah I guess (79:21 - 79:26)
they're side tournaments and stuff like (79:24 - 79:28)
that yeah that's right Grassroots stuff (79:26 - 79:32)
mostly comes in yeah I know uh there was (79:28 - 79:34)
last year (79:32 - 79:37)
at Worlds in London there was like a (79:34 - 79:40)
topsy tourney tournament where where it (79:37 - 79:42)
was like one of the side tournaments (79:40 - 79:43)
that Pokemon was putting on but you had (79:42 - 79:46)
to play with your switch upside down and (79:43 - 79:48)
you had to do the whole match and that (79:46 - 79:50)
was like a tournament structure (79:48 - 79:52)
I love that (79:50 - 79:54)
um they and they have stuff where like (79:52 - 79:57)
uh (79:54 - 79:59)
you you can only bring like middle (79:57 - 80:01)
Evolutions or they'll have like Pokemon (79:59 - 80:03)
stadiums like they have a bunch of like (80:01 - 80:05)
side tournaments and it's you know as (80:03 - 80:07)
fun as the organizers lead it up to be (80:05 - 80:08)
and sometimes they have older side (80:07 - 80:10)
tournaments where it's like oh the you (80:08 - 80:12)
know bring your copy of X and Y and (80:10 - 80:14)
bring your X and Y you know competitive (80:12 - 80:16)
team and we'll go back and (80:14 - 80:19)
suffer through Mega Evolution for 20 (80:16 - 80:21)
minutes (80:19 - 80:21)
later badges for Milwaukee are 10.55 (80:22 - 80:30)
cents oh they get you on the 55. (80:26 - 80:32)
I wonder why it's twice as expensive as (80:30 - 80:34)
it was here (80:32 - 80:36)
maybe Portland desperate for (80:34 - 80:39)
perspectives I don't know was it crowded (80:36 - 80:41)
or was it it was it was sold out I mean (80:39 - 80:43)
I had to get the second round of (80:41 - 80:45)
spectator badges because it was (80:43 - 80:46)
completely sold out I had to wait till (80:45 - 80:48)
Saturday afternoon well that's why (80:46 - 80:51)
you're like a donut with like tricks on (80:48 - 80:53)
it and like slap a copy in your hand (80:51 - 80:55)
when you walked in that's like the (80:53 - 80:57)
Portland experience right that is the (80:55 - 80:59)
stereotypical Portland experience that's (80:57 - 81:02)
what tourists go for but now I got a (80:59 - 81:03)
wristband I still have it on my (81:02 - 81:06)
bookshelf but did they put a bird on it (81:03 - 81:08)
that's the question (81:06 - 81:10)
how many food how many donut food trucks (81:08 - 81:13)
were outside the convention (81:10 - 81:16)
there were no food what I'm out that I (81:13 - 81:18)
saw there were no food trucks that I saw (81:16 - 81:21)
of course I was there only on the Sunday (81:18 - 81:23)
I wasn't there on the big day how many (81:21 - 81:25)
vendors did they have (81:23 - 81:26)
um (81:25 - 81:31)
there were three or four independent (81:26 - 81:33)
vendors I think maybe five okay yeah and (81:31 - 81:35)
then there was the TCG (81:33 - 81:37)
stand (81:35 - 81:39)
and I would assume plushes were slightly (81:37 - 81:41)
overpriced yeah (81:39 - 81:43)
as it goes (81:41 - 81:44)
pretty much any (81:43 - 81:46)
Pokemon plushes they're gonna be (81:44 - 81:48)
overpriced in one way or another yeah (81:46 - 81:50)
that's like the one (81:48 - 81:51)
really nice thing about the pop-up (81:50 - 81:53)
Pokemon Center is their (81:51 - 81:57)
official normal price plushes uh the the (81:53 - 81:59)
I guess the downside is usually when (81:57 - 82:01)
there's a pop-up Pokemon Center they (81:59 - 82:03)
don't allow vendors to compete (82:01 - 82:06)
um like with because pricing or shops (82:03 - 82:09)
but then the the cool thing I guess (82:06 - 82:10)
about vendors is sometimes they have (82:09 - 82:13)
like Japanese plushes that have never (82:10 - 82:14)
come to America or they have some (82:13 - 82:16)
Japanese merch but (82:14 - 82:19)
you definitely pay for that like you (82:16 - 82:20)
could probably find it cheaper online (82:19 - 82:23)
but then you have to wait like six years (82:20 - 82:25)
for it to be put on a boat because forty (82:23 - 82:28)
dollars for shipping yeah (82:25 - 82:34)
it's very capitalism strikes again (82:28 - 82:37)
I will say so I've been (82:34 - 82:39)
speaking capitalism I've been searching (82:37 - 82:41)
just because I get bored in between (82:39 - 82:45)
searching for jobs so there is a website (82:41 - 82:47)
that's sold things that are coming (82:45 - 82:51)
direct from manufacturers from China (82:47 - 82:56)
and I am so tempted by the Giant (82:51 - 83:01)
100 and like 60 piece Pokemon knockoff (82:56 - 83:03)
like Minifigures like this just big box (83:01 - 83:06)
full of little (83:03 - 83:10)
not like the Pokemon company (83:06 - 83:12)
knockoff figurines and I'm so tempted to (83:10 - 83:13)
buy it (83:12 - 83:16)
Oh you mean like the (83:13 - 83:18)
like not like Legos like little like (83:16 - 83:22)
little little figures I thought you were (83:18 - 83:23)
talking about the nanoblock stuff (83:22 - 83:25)
because the nanoblock stuff is official (83:23 - 83:28)
no this is clearly to put in like (83:25 - 83:30)
there's an advent calendar that I almost (83:28 - 83:32)
bought that was the not official Pokemon (83:30 - 83:35)
Advent calendar that also had like some (83:32 - 83:37)
of the most distressed looking Pokemon (83:35 - 83:40)
not cops I've ever seen in my life I was (83:37 - 83:43)
so tempted by this giant box if I had a (83:40 - 83:45)
job I'd be like yeah fire it up you can (83:43 - 83:47)
find those at comic book stores or games (83:45 - 83:49)
yes sometimes and you can just find some (83:47 - 83:51)
really messed up looking yeah almost (83:49 - 83:53)
Pokemon and I could get this sent (83:51 - 83:56)
straight to my home a giant box of (83:53 - 83:59)
random warped Pokemon for the low low (83:56 - 84:03)
price of like 10 bucks I mean if you (83:59 - 84:04)
don't like it you could probably use it (84:03 - 84:06)
as a weapon and scatter them across the (84:04 - 84:08)
floor and then when somebody wakes up (84:06 - 84:11)
yeah their feet are done for they're (84:08 - 84:14)
done (84:11 - 84:14)
uh well that that's our show for you (84:15 - 84:20)
guys today uh I don't know why I laughed (84:18 - 84:23)
so much this episode it was pretty good (84:20 - 84:27)
we will be back next week (84:23 - 84:28)
um (84:27 - 84:30)
look I'm assuming (84:28 - 84:33)
uh that next week uh after we're done (84:30 - 84:34)
recording They will announce another (84:33 - 84:39)
seven star raid because boy the Pokemon (84:34 - 84:43)
company will allow no weekend to go (84:39 - 84:47)
empty here yep um so our our only two (84:43 - 84:50)
raid Pokemon left uh in the game code (84:47 - 84:53)
would be uh (84:50 - 84:56)
Delphox and realaboom I don't know if (84:53 - 84:57)
they're going to do two grass Pokemon (84:56 - 84:59)
back to back but they did start off with (84:57 - 85:01)
two fire Pokemon at the beginning of all (84:59 - 85:04)
of this (85:01 - 85:04)
um their tarot type fixes all of that (85:04 - 85:11)
yeah sure that's true the (85:05 - 85:14)
there there there is no for alligator (85:11 - 85:18)
there is no incineroar there is no uh (85:14 - 85:20)
Meganium in the game code currently (85:18 - 85:22)
we've talked about this I know people (85:20 - 85:25)
are like where is the Empoleon (85:22 - 85:27)
it's not (85:25 - 85:29)
it's not in the game right now (85:27 - 85:31)
um (85:29 - 85:31)
so (85:31 - 85:36)
when they're out of starters I don't (85:33 - 85:37)
know (85:36 - 85:39)
they got two left I don't know what (85:37 - 85:42)
they're gonna do besides maybe repeat (85:39 - 85:45)
I think if I do the math correctly they (85:42 - 85:48)
could technically take Charizard Cinder (85:45 - 85:51)
a screw ninja and repeat them once a (85:48 - 85:52)
week (85:51 - 85:54)
and that would pretty much get us all (85:52 - 85:57)
through summer (85:54 - 85:57)
um (85:57 - 86:01)
and I don't think that's a bad thing to (85:58 - 86:04)
do I mean plenty of people have missed (86:01 - 86:07)
cinderace or the kids who are just (86:04 - 86:09)
getting into or all of the people who (86:07 - 86:10)
are just getting into summer vacation (86:09 - 86:12)
and things like that (86:10 - 86:14)
this would be a great time for everybody (86:12 - 86:16)
to catch up on any raids they missed (86:14 - 86:18)
so I'm not saying they're gonna do that (86:16 - 86:20)
I'm just saying that like the math kind (86:18 - 86:22)
of lines up if they take (86:20 - 86:25)
everything they've released they can get (86:22 - 86:27)
another like two and a half months by (86:25 - 86:29)
just repeating these (86:27 - 86:31)
um (86:29 - 86:33)
uh they I don't know they could put like (86:31 - 86:34)
Kazooie and Pokemon in right like it (86:33 - 86:36)
doesn't have to be a starter right it (86:34 - 86:38)
could be any a seven star doesn't have (86:36 - 86:40)
to be a star it could be whatever they (86:38 - 86:42)
want it to be so (86:40 - 86:45)
um they could do his suian uh we still (86:42 - 86:47)
we are officially (86:45 - 86:50)
in the they have one month left of (86:47 - 86:51)
Pokemon home (86:50 - 86:55)
no no it's the 21st for summer right (86:51 - 86:57)
first day of summer is the 21st it is (86:55 - 87:00)
the 21st of June so they have one month (86:57 - 87:03)
in a week of (87:00 - 87:05)
maybe home will come out I I think there (87:03 - 87:06)
were rumors that it was coming out on (87:05 - 87:09)
the 18th but I think those rumors also (87:06 - 87:11)
said that gof I saw a rumor that it was (87:09 - 87:13)
supposed to come out on May 18th but I'm (87:11 - 87:15)
pretty sure that rumor also said that go (87:13 - 87:17)
Fest was going to be in Tokyo and (87:15 - 87:20)
Central Park for New York and (87:17 - 87:22)
both of those were wrong (87:20 - 87:25)
I mean the New York was right yeah I (87:22 - 87:28)
mean but the the Tokyo was very like (87:25 - 87:32)
wrong it was it's an Osaka (87:28 - 87:34)
um so I don't know how much it's in (87:32 - 87:36)
Japan yeah it's like it's all of Japan (87:34 - 87:38)
look it's going to be in the United (87:36 - 87:40)
