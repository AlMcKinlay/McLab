[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 414 episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective first podcast after the first ever Pokemon DLC so strap on in no strap so we'll in the passenger seat here oh thank goodness I'm in the passenger seat because I took a spill on my bike yesterday and I'm 50% road rash right hobby is going to kill you yes that was the intent okay I got Greg in the backseat yellow this is how it's gonna go and it's gonna go before I unreal this sucker oh it's like how you said how it's gonna go cuz it never goes that way we are going to talk about the Pokemon news that happened the announcement before the DLC came out as as kind of speculated last week the DLC did not arrive at midnight it arrived after the announcement that they planned and after the Pokemon hill maintenance so that seemed to line up pretty pretty okay so I guess for the next DLC for probably the same thing I guess I mean Japan at night America in the morning and New Zealand waiting the next day I guess Rick probably what it's gonna be so we're gonna talk about the announcement stuff then we'll go to break then we're gonna talk all about our thoughts of the DLC now the story isn't particularly long we speculated probably two to three hours which it ended up being I think unless you literally didn't get distracted by any other of the new stuff and you just did the story I'm sure you could probably do it way way quicker but I guess we'll talk about that when we get there so if you're worried about story stuff we will talk about that next week again I don't think I feel like if you don't buy the DLC in the first two weeks and you don't complete the two to three hour story in the first two weeks maybe you don't care that it's super short this is a point that will come up later yeah but we will talk about things that unlock mechanics that might but that might push you to finish the story and I don't really think those are too spoilery but that that's just the show I mean it's it's it's hard because half our audience probably doesn't want spoiler and the other half wants to hear our thoughts on literally every single thing so there's this weird balance we have to do let's just get right into things there was an 11 minute announcement on Wednesday before the DLC dropped and the first thing they opened with was Pokemon not sleep let's smile nah Pokemon smile a thing I can't use you don't smile you don't brush your teeth okay I have an electric toothbrush huh and if I have my mouth open toothpaste lies everywhere yes so no teeth in the shower I won not bringing my phone in the shower for one smile either I'm not gonna bring my mini computer into the shower so that I can spray toothpaste all over it with my electric toothbrush that already measures two minutes yeah I mean this is my problem too I brush my teeth in the shower and I don't want to bring my phone in the shower just to get a picture of a Pokemon but you might be wondering what Pokemon smile is and why there is an official website smile a Pokemon calm motivating children to brush their teeth can be tough but with this clever app brushing becomes an exciting adventure by using your smart devices camera to play the game children can brush their teeth to rescue Pokemon that have been captured by cavity-causing bacteria children will be excited to save their Pokemon friends it is a freedom at this it's it's a literally a free app not a free to start not a free to play there is nothing there's no purchases there's no scam here there's no app it's just yet free because this is specifically a children's app I have talked to a various amount of parents and those parents have said that their small children are completely in love with this app I can't get art here super cute I can't really give you my thoughts of it because I haven't used it yet I have downloaded it but I think you can catch pokemon in it and stuff when you're finished brushing your teeth and I'm pretty sure there's a four-hour cooldown in the app so you can't just like keep brushing keep brushing to unlocking Russian wear down your teeth to catch that Diglett oh yes please remember to use a medium or soft toothbrush please thank you do they even make hard toothbrushes oh yes dentures yeah switching from medium Assaf was probably the best life decision I've made in the last five years from medium to soft from medium to soft okay but yeah I can't use this because many reasons but I think the art is super cute I've seen people take pictures of it and put it on the Twitter's which is also very cute yeah it's a cute idea wait a branch out they got a Pokemon still working and dominate the lifecycle of you waking up thinking about going to bed thinking about Pokemon but clearly not while you're sleeping they announced another new game called Pokemon cafe mix in this announcement cafe mix pokemon calm it will actually be out in about a week I think it comes out on the 27th so relatively soon oddly enough that they announced two games last year that are still not out yet but this game comes out in a week it's coming to the eShop Nintendo eShop the Apple App Store and Google Play Pokemon cafe mix is a free to start puzzle game for the Nintendo switch and smart devices work together to complete puzzles and create wonderful drinks and dishes to serve at your Pokemon cafe this is pretty much tsumtsum it is a Pokemon version of tsumtsum okay I mean it was multiple games not just one is it really just one game yeah it's just the like drag to match the if you've never played Tsun Tsun i explain this i've never played it in the weird they just need to be drawing circles and then stopping into like 50 life right there I'm pretty sure Disney tsumtsum is a ripoff of another game but Disney tsumtsum is it's it's on mobile they have arcade machines of them in both America and in Japan tsumtsum whole gimmick in the arcade system was you would put your coins in and then you would get an actual figure and then you would scan the figure on the arcade machine and then it would remember Aladdin would have a different ultimate or a different super than then blink and beauty of the beast from Beauty and the Beast or from like Nemo like they would have different things but ideally in tsumtsum and I'm not sure I'm I don't know about cafe mix because we haven't seen enough about it but tsumtsum would pretty much have four different characters like buzz woody the thing from wall-e wall-e the thing for wall-e wall-e wall-e emotionally and like Cinderella and then you would have to match their faces they would be all jumbled up and you would have to drag all the buzzes to match and then all the buzzes disappear and then more drop down and then it's usually like you usually have like 60 or 120 seconds but you're trying to combo and keep matching them as fast as possible to get a high score so there's really no wind condition or a loose condition the wind condition is just beating your high score over and over but normally if you do a big enough combo you'll have ability of a like a super I don't know buzzes super might be it might turn all the Cinderella's into more buzzes so it would be easier to drag and match them so this isn't like a bejeweled thing you are literally just able to drag them around in a path and be like I did those figure-eight and hit all these and then release and that counts yeah the more you've linked together is like the the better that it is it looks a little different than tsumtsum when I see their dumb dragging it it seems that they're pushing and dragging at the same time which seems to me doesn't have they're kind of locked into place until you're done matching them and then they disappear and then everything falls this looks to have a little bit of a push feature either way I'm always down for a puzzle game I haven't I haven't had a good puzzle game in my life in a while art cute I'm into this hot liquid cocoa that is such a cute little I want that in real life I'll probably pay it play it for an hour and I'm back to garden escapes with me maybe this is your new garden escapes because you get to build out there nowadays I doubt it but look at all the cute helpers you can get but I can get the stimulus hang things and the new disappear you need to match 17 things and then they disappear no I don't know if the appeal is there look at that Lucario in an apron and little you know newsy cabin it's so cute is a Lucario in an apron that's true and a newsie hat even though this is on the antenna switch I tweeted about this but it looks like you will only be able to play this in handheld mode and then it's a no switch probably because it's it's a touchscreen game I don't know how you would drag and match with sticks well we used to have to do that in Robotron 20 what was that 20 40 but there was no dragging and matching in Robotron oh but you had two sticks does move things around true you well one was to move your feet and the other was to aim your laser Oh Roberto in 2084 we are not that far from that future horrible future of a mutant gets prepared it's only 64 years away it looks that the developer is just it just says Nintendo creatures Game Freak which probably means that creatures worked on this game I believe creatures also helps mostly with Pokemon shuffle which is another puzzle game creatures makes games every now and then yeah but usually if it's made by Game Freak they say made by game they look Game Freak is very they put their name on things like quest so I think I think this is probably made by creatures and I'm assuming Pokemon smile is also made by creatures since we don't see a different develop here here on the bottom of bottom of the website but that gets to the third game announcement which is very badly titled but new I got into this we watched the thing and then Brent's co-worker was like oh is Greg super excited for Pokemon snap too and I was like no cuz it's not called Pokemon snap dude it's called new Pokemon snap he's like so what happens when they make another lame apple I blame Apple they did this they did this is an apples this is Apple's fault yes it is yeah 100% just give it a number give it a version name it something else I mean there is problems with there is problems with naming it too because then people feel like they they didn't play the first one and put him on digital photography that's exists when the end I mean they could have done Pokemon snap : you take a picture you said it to your friends perfect licensing and cross-promotion opportunity Pokemon tick tock alright hold on he says the new Pokemon snap game for the Nintendo switches based on its namesake which was the first released for the Nintendo 64 in 1999 this game will take trainers on an adventure to the unknown island overflowing with natural sites such as jungles and beaches where they can research various Pokemon in their natural habitats they will take photos to make their very own in-game photo decks Pokemon photo decks all why discovering new never-before-seen Pokemon expressions and behaviors there's no way this games coming out this year nope really yes why why because we don't even know when to the detective Pikachu sequels coming out then I thought a year ago whatever happened to like under-promise and over-deliver they they've messed up a few of the orders of these words who here over-promising and under-delivering oh I just I could see this coming out in October if it wasn't for the fact that cafe mix is also coming out the other DLC is coming out in November like if I can't think of a time this year unless they do it around August that this has breathing room yeah hmm yeah I just they didn't even like say like all of yeah they said nothing 2020 I mean maybe it comes out like spring of 2021 like I could see it coming or out around my Pokemon day the fact that we didn't hear from Pokemon sleep and we didn't hear about detective Pikachu to which we might be hear about you know in the upcoming announcement it's just like I don't I don't know if this game is coming anytime soon which is whatever it's fine I think I think announcing it was probably good enough I'm on the website it says get ready for a new Pokemon snap an all-new adventure for them to send us which inspired by the classic Nintendo 64 game Pokemon snap in new Pokemon snap you explored depths of deserts jungles and more as you photograph fan favorite Pokemon and never-before-seen Pokemon expressions and behaviors we saw that there were pre marina we saw that there were drifloon we saw Torterra and square bunny and Audrey oh so well only the fan favorites not the fan not favorites now also the reason we brought up developers of the last two games it specifically says at the bottom of this website that it is developed by Bandai Namco they have also made Hoke pokken tournament I think they also made Katamari Damacy the greatest game of all time so you know I feel like they've also made a ton of Naruto yes man got to make money somehow can't all be great Bart so I know there's a ton of people out there who haven't played pokemon snap probably just because of their age pokemon snaps like a 20 year old game for the Nintendo 64 but I don't I just like Mario Kart there's not a person that I have ever met that hated Pokemon I think it's just a pretty universally liked franchise game well not franchise there was no okay so okay I rented Pokemon snap from the video store blockbuster was at Blockbuster not blockbuster Tomek video no local DC team monka monka I'm not quite they had numerous stores but either way successful mod but I played it for two hours I couldn't figure out what was going on and I returned it and got a different game that is my history of Pokemon snap I played the heck out of Pokemon stand because it's like you take a picture and it's like was my picture good enough I don't want a computer judging my phone look I'll give you a hot tip in Pokemon snap the computer doesn't even know if your photos it was either wonderful or it was maybe next time or whatever the he says oh but and you have to throw the apples to make the Pokemon come out and the shock balls so you have to aim and hit and you're on Rails it's so much so much going on that you can make you can make electrodes blow up and drop down Kakuna x' was a good game yeah yeah I mean it was good here's the thing for what it did which was virtually nothing it did that well it was fun to actually see for the first time ever in Pokemon snap Pokemon in a habitat my concern about this is they have changed the games so that they're already appearing in their habitat so I'm not sure how much awe and wonder a new generation is gonna get out of snap and I'm not sure that people who are now in their 20s and 30s who played this first when they're kids are gonna have a ton of fun that's not that's gonna go past their initial half an hour of install juh like there has to be some decent gameplay in this to make it successful for people I think I think what Pokemon snap does well and I was I was a kid when pokemon snap came out so what were Nintendo 64 games they were like 40 bucks 50 bucks high brainer it they were usually around 30 I think 30 or 40 I want to say there were 40 because weren't gameboy games 30 yeah yeah maybe that anyways but like even though pokemon snap is is is actually like a 45 minute game if you if you know if you've played it before and like to get some you which is I guess the the final part of that game spoiler there's sixty three Pokemon in Pokemon snap the last one you get to is mu and then when you can't take a picture of it that's kind of like the the end of it you know if you played it before you can usually beat that game in like 45 minutes maybe ninety minutes if if you need to redo a course or whatever but it's a relatively short game mm-hmm but I don't think that that's inherently bad by itself because it makes up for that with with its charm that game used with personality but that was also in a time where Pokemon Stadium also used with personality because yeah we we didn't have like the only thing we had was these the Gameboy images like we had like these very small pixelated black and white things so seeing like your black and white pixelated Charizard being a full-on moving Charizard in a video game what that was the impressive thing that was awe-inspiring yes yes and there's a lot of things in Pokemon snap that that are just very memorable like getting all the charm Anders to line up and then all of them screaming at you for the apples and I think like Pokemon snap even though like the gameplay is very shallow and and I think most people who love Pokemon and snap well while they'll probably talk about their memories of the charm Anders or the the Mull trace but busting out of that egg no one really talks about like the engaging gameplay which is pretty much non-existent like you're taking pictures the the does a very bad job at determining whether that picture is good or bad and at the end of the day like your I guess you could it could be like a Tetris game where you're like oh well you're only competing against yourself to get a higher score of your picture but a lot of that is just rng of will the computer actually accept this as a better picture so I don't know how they capture that again mechanically I think they can definitely hit it out of the park with the expressions and the animations and making you and I think if we look at sword and shield with cup foo I don't think a lot of people went into sword and shield being like oh man I'm excited for cup foo but I think if anything the story did this is not a spoiler is the story makes you walk away appreciating Cup food because they gave cub foo time to shine and I think they can do that and snap with Pokemon so I'm not worried about that part I'm more worried about like mechanically is this gonna be fun to go through it time and time again because as a kid it was but as an adult I don't know well I mean we'll all give it a try and then we'll either be pleasantly surprised or I wouldn't say disappointed because I think our expectations are right do we think this is gonna be a full $60 game yes hundra's oh look the Zelda that that zelda links awakening the remake of a $7.99 shop game on the 3ds they remade it they charged $60 and people lost their minds it like Pokemon carries they lost their minds because they thought that price was inappropriate for a complete reskin of a former two-dimensional game into something with three dimensions yes then they thought that Link's Awakening should should have been $40 instead of 60 now now that's that that I cannot agree with all they did was copy and paste an older game there's no way this is about $50 right they tried they not only charged no $60 for easily this game is not $60 no III they charged $60 for pokken tournament and then they re-released in the Wii U and charged another 60 or they away from any use for $60 pokken tournament and then they re released it on switch and again charge $60 there's no way this game is not so here's the deal I this give me a price point per number this and for all future Pokemon games this is that you give me a price point per number of Pokemon in the game and that's what okay it's like a dollar 25 per Pokemon so as many as you can jam in there that's as many as much money as your that's way too expensive that's 23 cents per Pokemon you think it do you want it to be $40 or do you think it'll be $40 you think for a game that is on Rails where you're only unless they've made like super significant changes well they have to though like there's no way it's the same thing where it's like you can't walk around you're just you are on this guided thing and it's like you aim your camera and throw an apple and hope that you mm-hmm that ain't worth $60 friend I know and the graphics didn't even look that good the amount of people that were like I don't excited for a game and not put down another game but the amount of people that were like this is what sword and shield graphics should have been but they're totally like you're comparing an open-world RPG to an on Rails video game from 30 seconds of footage that we don't even know what the rest of the game looks like we don't even know if that's we don't even know if that's just like CG footage or that's like early render like that's so frustrating like you can be excited for snap without like throwing sword and shield under the bus and I feel like every time people bring up certain chills graphics there they only focus on the wild area which is like very bad like the wild area looks like trash like no one no one's saying that but especially now but like all of these it's all of the actual routes outside of the wild area are pretty awesome yeah I mean like I would I would probably say that pokken tournament looks better than sword and shield but also pokken tournament has like 10 arenas and like 20 Pokemon yep like it's that's that's that's the key right there as well a lot of information that has to be stored and the routes are all set camera like everything that set cameras a lot easier to design because you don't have to have people try to move the camera and to make sure that it looks good from every angle you are presenting a fully rendered graphical gorgeous representation and that's a lot of what's gonna happen in snap you are in a painting that you can spin around and look at set paintings but it's not it is not the same as fully having to go up and interact and shake a tree and I mean they're very very different things I did ask on Twitter I said how many assuming that all 892 I guess that'll eventually be 95 when the other DLC comes out assuming that not all 800 some Pokemon are in it how many would be worth it to you well they can't be because it's only the fan favorites yeah there's no way it has all 800 Pokemon 21% said 200 to 300 we would be okay 31% said 300 to 400 would be okay 18% said that 400 to 500 would be okay and 29% wanted 500 plus Pokemon in Pokemon snap so in the original game it was 63 it was a 63 64 because it was the Nintendo 64 but they couldn't get Ekans to work so they pulled Ekans last minute back together and I said a bad word so that and and and that was before Jen - yeah that was before Jo Jo correct yeah that was so we're looking at about 40% of all Pokemon is what the producers of the game feel is inadequate number of Pokemon to appear in the game so what's 40% of 893 300 ish three well a 50% of 900 is 450 then 40% is between 300 and 400 I think I think it's about 400 so there you go 400 this time doing it yeah I don't I don't know mystery dungeon or a ranger or any of those other games enough to know like like I like mystery dungeon doesn't have you know 200 maybe it does does it have like 300 Pokemon in it I don't think it does have you I have no idea the new one um oh it's got a lot wasn't super missed even maybe rumble was there there had to be a rumble that had like all of them up to the point right I think rump I think one of the rumbles did are we talking about the new rescue team DX yeah yeah yeah Mike that's it that's us which game it has this the power of the switch and what is that magical power I don't know I think my favorite thing to come out of the Pokemon snap announcement and maybe it's cuz I'm like being cynical here but the people that were like I finally I was five I told you I'm Pokemon staff coming yeah I mean yeah sure I guess if you say pokemon snap every year for the last 20 years I guess you'll eventually be here right you heard it here first I bet eventually they'll redo a Gen 6 Pokemon game and we'll get us will get something X&Y related probably the next 20 years if I keep saying it often [ __ ] I'll eventually be right sure it looks like mystery dungeon had 480 okay roughly that's a pretty good number yeah I mean we're so we're counting evolutions right like yeah yes including their voice yeah yeah yeah there's like so many questions like how long is a route how many routes are on it or the Pokemon changing on their routes like obviously the the easy things to answer they're hidden things right like when you first did the the first Beach route in in the original you know Scyther was in the grass and you had to kind of like hopefully throw your pester balls in there to hit him and then he would pop up and then be like I found him so I I don't doubt there would be a bunch of hidden stuff but you know if I'm it looks like at least I'm assuming they're gonna redo the beach route for the first route because that's what they hinted at at the trailer and then there will be new routes after that but if we go through a route are they gonna change the Pokemon it's gonna be the same are they gonna add whether we're like oh because it's raining in the route now you're gonna see more water pokemon like if they're gonna do even if they're gonna do 200 Pokemon which is four times the amount that was in the original I mean the routes in the original were already pretty crowded with Pokemon yeah like you were pretty actively taking pictures of things the entire time and I don't what was the average length on a route like maybe four minutes yeah they weren't particularly they weren't long like far in that game I feel like even four minutes is too long but maybe that I mean yep maybe five minutes max they were not long yeah I'm just curious how they do it I think they can I'm not I don't I feel like it would be very hard to make it a bad game I just don't know how they make it I just don't know how a Pokemon snap looks in 2020 yeah I mean there's a thing though where I mean they still have the I'm assuming take the pictures then post them to social media which was like replicating the going and having them printed out thing so at least you can take some good pictures and share them and I think that will extend the life actually make memes yeah absolutely in I if any company could do it the Pokemon company could definitely have it where you you at the end of the game you say like I want to order these prints and then they mail it to you like they could do it by touch her prints in a frame yeah I snapped these um based based on the base and the fact that I'm that 63 percent I think of all of their revenue ever is is merchandise yeah I feel like they could sell us postcard / stickers of our pictures at the end of the game and they could probably find some company that just fulfills it and ships it to you at a cost I mean they convinced blockbuster to put giant they could do that 20 years ago they can convince some company or send us something well heck if jackbox games can send out yeah yeah I think maybe the only worry is you know it's well it's the same worried that you know parents have had for the last ten years of the Apple AppStore is you know little Timmy picks up the phone and purchases hundred gems in clash Royale or a million gems in clash Royale and then you have to send a support thing my kid bought these I don't actually want to spend a hundred dollars on your game you probably don't come across this much because it's not the way you live your life but you can actually put parental restrictions on the switch I'm gonna say purchasing from snap requires your parents to put in the password yeah I think that would probably be the coolest thing to walk away from snap with though but being getting framed pictures yeah if they want to redo the hole in the soldier thing like the picture thing if they if they have a way to do that that would I I would be I would be very impressed and I kind of thought the snap was dead in the water you know because of Pokemon go like I have a very good camera in my pocket and I have at this point five hundred plus Pokemon in cuz they're at Gen 5 now that I can take pictures of in the world yeah but the what you can't do is a lot of interaction right like they have very set poses you can't see them interacting with each other real world is definitely not the vibrancy that the Pokemon world is there is a lot that snap can do that makes it look much more fantastical than me walking through a park and having my poorly rendered tree in the background of my Pokemon I definitely agree with that absolutely it was funny cuz like right before a sword and shield came out I think I was at Eurogamer I think it was Eurogamer asked Masoud oh why didn't they do a Pokemon snap and he was like we don't have any new ideas for it so that's why we've never remade it he was lied to them well that was what ten months ago at this point yeah okay so this game has been in development for three years so he lied to them I don't know about three years we don't know the development cycle of it yet but you want us to pay $60 for a game that they published and look they're produced in under China - no I'm just saying like is falling apart before your very eyes why why would he sit at an interview and say like it's the if the interviewer goes hey you make it a Pokemon snap where's you're supposed to say yeah yes that's a bad way announcing a game well I wouldn't say it in a way that makes it sound like why would we do that we are so uncreated we can't think I would say the time for a new snap has not appeared yet or something like that that's like mysterious but not a lie yeah but they still haven't even showed what the new feature is like his words were we haven't thought of a new feature yet and I'm that trailer I haven't seen what this new feature via the new feature is it's on the switch Congrats hey at least they didn't make the mistake of putting it on the Wii U there is like little to no information about this game though so I prepared to be pleasantly surprised maybe we just won't hear about it for the next year just like sleep and detect about you they'll just be like alright well we we said if we told you you'll get it when we're good and ready well I guess there's two bits the real quick one is in collaborative and collaboration with the antic the Pokemon company announced that mega evolutions will appear in the real world and Pokemon go fans can look forward to experiencing a new take on mega evolution that takes advantage of Pokemon goes unique gameplay I sure yeah I'm not particularly excited for this right cuz I don't I don't battle in Pokemon go sowhat's mega evolution gonna get me you've summed up all of X&Y auras and sunny mood if you're not in the battle a battle in those games yeah that was always the weird thing about mega evolution to me is like it was a battle mechanic but not a in my opinion a very interesting one because not only did you only have like 59 Pokemon to pick from forced you to build your team around those Pokemon specifically whereas like Dynomax I can pick any six and any six of those can die no max yeah and mega was like if I win against somebody who had a Kangaskhan on their team that's like well that's the one that's how they trick you yeah I don't know I whatever I like obviously mega evolution was gonna come I mean mega evolution is in Pokemon masters sar enough yeah well so some some trainers can mega evolve some come at ya some cash they just don't like their Pokemon enough so I I'll be curious to see what they do I'm I hope it's not something like you gotta collect all 59 mega stones by spinning stops seven days in a row and hope that I think the 1% chance to get the mega stone and I that's that that seems to be their summer thing right they said like this summer I think yeah okay last bit last bit of news before we take a break earn a shiny Zehra aura and armor right or in pokemon sword and pokemon shield if 1 million trainers defeat Zehra aura in max raid battles players can receive a special Pokemon along with items that will be useful in the island of armor okay let's there's more to it here the island armor armor the first part of the pokemon sword expansion past and the pokemon shield expansion pass has arrived to celebrate the release of the new chapter of pokemon sword and pokemon shield adventures players can participate in max raids against the mythical Pokemon Zehra aura from June 17th to Sunday June 28th Zehra aura will appear in max rate battles your friends as you attempt to take down this mythical Pokemon Zehra aura has the append a potential to appear in three star max raids or higher and in five star max raids there is a chance that you can encounter an especially powerful shiny Zehra aura you won't be able to catch their aura after it's defeated but if at least 1 million trainers managed to defeat zero aura during the special event a Chinese air aura will be available to everyone in Pokemon home in addition to a shiny zero aura every player who takes part in these max rate battles will receive a piece of armor right or for every hundred thousand trainers that defeat Zahra aura after the first a million up to a maximum of ten pieces basic math is 2 million armor it--or can be used in the dojo of the island of armor if you have to have your Pokemon learn moves if the target numbers is reached you will be able to claim your Chinese air aura and your armor right or via mystery gifts on your mobile device of Pokemon home on Monday June 29th starting at 5 p.m. Pacific time until Monday July 6 note you do not have to have the expansion to encounter or to receive Zehra aura in order to claim these gifts you must meet the following condition all right so to make this very clear even if your if you're lazy and you don't do a single Zehra aura as long as you transfer a pokemon from home whose sword and shield between now and July 6 you will be able to redeem the zero aura if the community does the million if the community has a million people participate you have to transfer a Pokemon I would strongly encourage you to do as era aura because as of Friday morning I think we were only at two hundred and thirty seven thousand trainers and the lowboy we're back to Ultra Sun all tremé so it needs a million trainers what that means is it doesn't matter if you do one or twenty zero aura raids you only count as one trainer and the fact that on launch day and 48 hours after we're only at 237,000 is very concerning look I've been busy where do I find this surah zero so the last update that I saw was two hundred and seventy two thousand three hundred and thirty five players okay that was on June 19th I have not seen an update since then okay so we are a little over horse of the way there is still a long way to go maybe because the DLC came out on a Wednesday people were busy with work and school I mean this and what that was pre weekend I was pre weekend yeah so we may get a big update over the weekend to talk about the shinies there or a real quick Sarah B is reporting that Chinese air aura has a five percent chance to appear in a five star raid while you cannot catch it it is significantly harder all these yeah five stars their auras are normally around level 60 like most five star Pokemon um the shinies their auras level 100 and you do get better rewards from it so if you want the challenge if you're if you're one of those people that were like I wish Pokemon was harder here you go yeah it's hard I still haven't cleared a shiny one they're not too terribly defined I it it's I needed a full team of humans to to do it you do get I think the rewards are significantly better so um I guess do your part do my best and what Greg and will referenced about ultrason ultrasonic moon-like well I think one of them was like catch five million Pokemon or something in a month and I don't even think we made it to Arian they're nowhere close because that was the first one and then the then the goals dropped significant oh yes absolutely so we have failed things before five people turn on the game please so I saw some people saying I don't worry they'll just give it to us ah no no no definitely failed a lot of different things in Sun and Moon and ultra Sun and ultramoon yeah I get it there were things you had to jump through that game you had to like talk to the festival Plaza chick and everything like I understand there was more hoops to jump through but we definitely failed a lot of them um we did pass some of them I think we passed the Wonder trade one and we passed the the Mantine surf one or something but well once they dropped the gold numbers yeah we pat they started clicking those off real quick but the first one the product is first three that were like really lofty goals all of those Oh hard for whatever magical reason a million people do it we get the zero aura if then another million people do it we'd get a zero or a plus ten armor right or but maybe you don't you don't need the expansion to do it you don't need the expansion to receive it I guess now now is the now's the time I think a lot of people are missing their aura for the Pokedex this is the second time they'll be distributing it yep go get them maybe it'll give us a pity prize of the regular one if we don't hit maybe I hope so okay let's take a break when we come back we're gonna talk about our thoughts of the Isle of armor we're gonna set the story stuff aside but everything else will be fair game so we will be right back [Music] I have a very important announcement as you prepared for a very important announcement yes school accompaniment so that first happen sometimes attend major international stage it goes [Music] doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo do you recognize it so it is the intro to my new podcast kata Mari gasps : let's roll up together [Music] lost control of this show this show [Music] alright basic question did gamefreak do DLC right 80% I give it a solid B what is right means I don't I downloaded it it was content Careca 100% you you met the basic it worked actually it didn't work because I long version no I opened yeah here's the trick on how to avoid buying the wrong version you start your game go to the menu screen and buy it from there it's only and let you buy the one you want no I like all day on Wednesday I went in and was playing and didn't get any announcement that it was available but then Thursday morning when I started up to do my morning I'm still trying to finish my pokedex yeah a little thing popped up and says oh you have an Armour pass did little B and then took me I could go to the train station and it was like but I was expecting my armor passed yesterday yeah I had the forest mind to download a cup like I was really working on my I was working my switch to make it download I had I had no problems full disclosure uh Nintendo did send me two free copies of the expansion they'd sent me a free copy of the sword expansion and the shield expansion the they sent him to me lights so because I didn't want to wait I did buy the shield version myself which I have been playing just full disclosure Nintendo did provide me with free copies of the DLC that I have not redeemed yet just want to get that another way I'm really happy with the DLC and I guess if if the if our only comparison is were used to this third game I think this is better I think they were able to do it at least in this version and I think it was worth the money and I think there was enough things - there was enough things for somebody who likes a little bit of everything to feel satisfied and I can totally see if you only pokedex filler or if you were only a competitive battler that you might well competitive Ahlers there's no way they don't feel service yeah literally what this DLC who like story like me yeah mmm I think my fish might my first review that I gave both of you still stands it was worth $15 so there's a couple of things the story is really short and really thin this up bad is just I you know it made me smile yeah there's a couple yeah but overall it's just like oh like I finished it I was like oh okay well that's it uh-huh I heard and I I don't have this verified I heard if you do not finish postgame you actually don't get some of the story oh really yeah well that makes sense it does make sense because there's the important character development in the postgame and if you don't finish the post key I've heard that I'm not a hundred percent sure on that but well it does add an extra I don't know what twenty thirty minutes to the story yeah the part where it's very obvious where it's like oh okay god you're here yep I think the shining thing about the DLC is the island looks incredible oh yes much bigger than I thought it would be yeah the island looks incredible there's a lot to explore its varied its what the wild the negative I think is that it makes the first wild area feel worse can you expand can you both expand on that because I've been thinking about this for the last couple days and the the words I hear is it makes if this while there is what the old wild area should have been is what I've been hearing I mean that's one way of saying it sure yeah I don't know how to put that into words and I don't know if you guys have some thoughts on that the wild area as it is is very flat it's a very linear plane there are some ramps up and down but you can see every think it's incredibly one-dimensional when you're just looking at it like oh I can see all the way to the other end and whoa but even worse than that it's it's grass it's patches of tall grass its water features and there's the occasional tree with some sprouts around it yep hey there's a mountain over by Doral Adhan and there's the Burt tipped-over tower over by the dusk oh yeah there's no mountain there's there's like a you can't climb it but it's just like a giant stiglitz to like tight that you have to go around and Doral and Donna's on the other side of it that portion yeah it's just a big hill yeah there you go I know me too Mountain so what the isle of armour does very well is when you get to an area there's like a swamp area and actually feels and looks like a swamp like the grass varies the trees are knocked over it has a very diff the color palette which wasn't happening in the original area unless you went to does lately different by them like we are now in the desert so everything in here is beige and then when you leave the desert it goes back to being just green whereas the isle of armour varies the colors a lot since they've added caves you go in and out of things you get the sense that you're going up and down and through an actual terrain whereas the old wild area it still felt like you're just going up and down ramps on a single plane like the old area felt like a skate park compared to this that actually feels like an actual environment I think my initial thing was like oh there's still a lot of glare and Pokemon that we've already seen inhabiting in the world in here which was a little disappointing like when I went to the swap area and it was basically all dread now the first toe first things that show disappointing like oh they changed they do change but the firt that was my first experience I was like it's beautiful but it's all it's ultimately all the same Pokemon as the weather change and as you move through you got to see more things but initially I was like oh whomp like there's one or two things spawning that are new but as you export like you explore the various islands out into the bays they get a little bit more interesting they're colored different you have the sort of terrifying shark attack thing which does not help my shark fear at all Sharpedo is side side note Sharpedo is cool the only one time only the first only the first time that he gets real Annoying real quick for taking up essentially a small area it feels expansive because you move in and out and interact with the terrain in very different ways and the terrain changes naturally like when you go into a cave like theirs they chain they blend the color palette to make it seem like oh you're going into this cave when you go into the forest the grass gets darker and then it goes into the forest the forest itself has it feels very twisty and you know like mysterious so they did so much texture and color and variation that it really makes the other wild area feel very flat no III and I think that's like the main thing I absolutely agree and it's like the things to me is just like even in that first area besides the fact that yes I was really aggravated that it's the teutuls and dread nas again moving around but it's like that there's little like pawns right and they're not the water features that you can't walk you just walk into the pond and like there's different colored like flower patches and things like that that you can walk around it which is much more like natural look young and it's not you know just the tall grass or the short grass and you know it's just like back and forth the trees do look better - I don't even care enough attention my biggest issue I have two huge issues I haven't gotten that far into I have not completed the story of the DLC so that's not that's just like so that's a limitation on my issue so far but number one that dude Avery who Mari Avery the rival I know no no no no no no whatever that's and I mustered I have no job and I I have the lady rival no yeah far I am walking over to the dojo and this dude runs over he's like oh you found my Diglett you're such a cool guy thank you for helping me out he's like I have a bunch of these a lowland Diglett and I could swear I read him say three and he's like would you help me find them and I'm like sure I'll help you find your three diglettz and he's like I have a hundred and fifty one was it 151 well you find the first one first yeah so you have to find a hundred fifty matter like you jerk I don't want to have to find your dag on diglettz everywhere oh yeah you have me to save your time well don't don't don't find the Diglett no I I'm just aggravated that he was so rude to bother to ask me to find an important second wait second cap layer the spawns when the the wandering Pokemon out in the field pop up they I don't know the right way to put it it's like you don't have enough distance before they pop up and I am running over wooperz left and right cause you're just spawning right under my feet but I will say the best and I was almost going to joke that I have completed the DLC because this is like the only thing I wanted I now have a black bike that sparkles like red flash as I ride it red and black are my colors I already like in the real world have a black bike and now I have a black bike in the game with red sparklies and that's all I ever wanted in Pokemon so I'm thrilled how many hours do you think you put in well like like two three five ah I think I've put in about three hours at this point okay yeah and Greg I think I put in probably ten I was doing a lot of raids so I can't say that that was quality content I say that part of my marking it down is the Diglett thing was interesting as a way to have to explore the island the number was way too high like stop trying to shove it into the gen1 numbering says I love the they love 151 it's it's not interesting and it's way too many like when you're in there and it's like you have 5,000 more to find in this area I'm like I'm not no I'm not going to I'm done I don't want to spoil the reward was for Diglett but if the reward was like a t-shirt that I could wear and that I could show off in like a max rate battle or in a like competitive battle that I did it I think that is a pretty low bar but that is like the low bar I would have expected as the final reward and I think I would have been happy with a shirt but it was not a shirt it was much worse yeah I know what it is I have to agree I'm also surprised that still the other UK dog snubbull and granbull are still not in this game hey there's one more DLC I know but come what really well I think um I think salamence was confirmed and but that second DLC - I mean salabanzi literally a European dragon yeah can we talk about the book Mun that are in the game oh sure I was just gonna say I just for the sake of this conversation I put 30 plus hours into the DLC so far I have completed the Pokedex I've completed the story I found all the diglettz I have almost unlocked everything in the dojo I have purchased every single bit of clothing I feel like in a sense I am done with the DLC of like what you could actually do like I said could be like well I played it for ten hours but I didn't do the Diglett stuff like okay well you technically still have something to do but I mean like if the Diglett stuff isn't fun for you I would not pursue it just to get the reward because I don't think he'd be satisfied but in the sense of like it took me about 30 hours to do everything I feel pretty satisfied and I'm feel pretty pretty happy with it they added a lot of interesting Pokemon that it all existed before I think I was disappointed that there weren't really no new glaring forms oh that is that is for sure that biggest disappointment yeah that that just knowing like playing around and expecting to run into something just a Glary apprising Psyduck or like literally anything like a goal Arian likho Tong since you like you know I don't know one that's wearing a tech seat something the fact that there is just nothing I was like it makes me really worried and though like the second one I'm just now assuming that they showed their hand they they show that they it's Kalei Rex it's it's Reggie Drago and it's cash register they showed their hand there's not gonna be anything else besides that and that's I think that disappointed me just I was expecting I didn't know that I was expecting I was hoping for a surprise one just like one just like one just something something and that didn't happen but they I mean and I'm they implemented a feature that was in other games and they implemented it sort of weird and I mean I think everyone knows by the following Pokemon the following did you know this yeah yeah I've seen it on Twitter it's they did it in a weird way like I don't know you can't see anybody else's you can only see yours and often they don't move fast enough so it always seems like they're just teleporting behind you if you're going fast especially in your bike you don't interacting with them is weird it's just it's that part felt a little tagged on I think in the fact and the fact that a lot of people like oh you can go talk to the Pikachu get to turn that off and a lot of people are like oh thank you for telling me just tells me that it wasn't it wasn't well implemented that a lot of people were expecting something to be as vital as it wasn't like heartgold SoulSilver and so many people are looking for a way to turn it off but in harness over its it's like a significantly easier / smaller thing right because it's like glue to your pixels it yeah it is one square big it moves as fast as like it's so much easier in that game yeah and I'm it's it just it just goes that like all of those people being like I'm not buying the game if they don't have following Pokemon they already copy and pasted everything just copy and paste it again but it's it's not that simple because not because one let's get like look at let's go Kanto is flat there is no Hills there are no ramps there are no is a flat body of land and Galler even if you even yes especially the island armor there are ramps there are stairs there are mountains there are caves there are ups and downs and take a Pokemon like Faye links it looks bad yeah because it doesn't know how to go up and down those stairs because it is it is like a ruler that is following you like I think like it's like a giant tape measure following you and it's just it just proves that like it's not copy and paste like all of these Pokemon or like there are what now yeah almost 600 Pokemon and yeah they have to fix failings they have then the now they have to go back and start fixing these for different environments and I'm sure in future Pokemon games it will be better but it just shows you that like it ain't copy and paste yeah well they did some like a vlog in the water basin in the water like there are so many really cool little moments that you'd think oh for sure this Pokemon who is a water pokemon will be able to also swim and then that doesn't happen yeah like Blastoise can't swim yeah but like yeah but like Avila is really cool in the water Keldeo is it responds how Keldeo should like it runs across the water I'm assuming in in the crown Tundra the same thing happens I'm assuming suicune should also be able to run across the water yep and the thing is is like those moments are cool and they get dulled when you try it with like your favorite Pokemon and it doesn't it doesn't behave how you think it should behave which it's like you took two steps forward because this is a great feature and you did a lot of cool things and then you hurt yourself by having us all step back like Magikarp doesn't swim right or Blastoise doesn't swim at all yeah and it's I think that I think they knew though I think like yeah that is why it didn't they didn't include it in the base game because all of the national Dexter's would have looked at it and been like yeah that was a complaint that was a complaint they hung on to you know they took away following Pokemon again but if they would have put it in all those same people would have been look at how bad this is yeah mm-hmm yeah they wouldn't they what that was it was a lose-lose for Game three it was a lose-lose yeah and I think I think this is mostly a win but it does feel a little off it does feel not completely finished which again this is why I can't say that this that I can't give this like an A+ or an A for the expansion because I think there's a number of things that that take away from the ultimate fun it is still very solid it I am still impressed that they did a DLC that even if you thought I had to pay $30 for this even though you're getting two I still think they got so close to it being worth $30 that you are excited for the next one to come but there are imperfections everywhere it does reflect well I think Jordan Shield has the imperfections yeah there's imperfections everywhere but I think it is mostly a positive experience and I you know I have no problems telling people yeah you should buy it and play it it's fun like Brent SOT you know he's like do I get to play it in this new area cuz he hasn't played Pokemon in a while and he's excited to go there and see all the new textures and and do the few things that he wants to do so it's exciting in that way and I think for their first shot they got very close the things that disappoint me or the story is way too short the Diglett thing is way too long there aren't new glaring forms which is disappointing there are still some striking Pokemon missing I'm thrilled that Dunsparce is there because they listen to me hmm they put my blood crammed everywhere yeah the max raids are there aren't a lot of new ones they're just more variety yeah hoping there'd be some more again mortgage I can to make reforms there aren't I think the zero aura raid is is good the shiny ones hard having pleaded it but that's that started the same you to feel I think that's fun pretty happy with the story it was better than I actually expected it was although it was the exactly the life that expected it to be and I hate to I hate to always hang on complaints but III think this is I think this is a good one that people said you know people grow up with Pokemon and and and they have the nostalgia of you know discovering things for our first time and a pretty common complaint I saw for certain shield and I think it's pretty valid is that people didn't feel like there was a sense of discovery and sword and shield and we we've heard that a lot really probably around X&Y where everything felt very straight and then Sun and Moon you know the the paths were pretty straightforward but the routes between things yeah that's true yeah and I I could maybe definitely agree with those people in sword and shield except like I don't know man when you get to the wild area how do you not have a sense of discovery in that in that sense but in in this I think they I think they nailed a sense of discovery you could you could art you could say like it takes no more than two hours to do the story if you did the story but how could you walk past the new areas of the wild area and not get distracted it took me five hours to get to the Diglett bridge because I was I was like oh that there I see a Diglett so that must be the Diglett guy that I've heard about so I don't want to talk to him yet and then I'm like out in the islands I'm looking at sharpedo's there's a giant whale lord when you start there's like so didn't catch it come back there are so many different ways you can go and the game doesn't force you to go to the dojo I think they nailed that and even when you talk to the Diglett and then you go past the then you get the bike ride away and you're like I don't even want to go into the dojo I want to use this new bike yeah then when you do like part one of the dojo then like new and pcs spawn outside and you're like well I want to talk to these guys I think of anything that the if your complaint was like Pokemon doesn't do there's no sense of discovery anymore I think this DLC is is loaded with that yeah even the like Islands way out behind the towers they they have mints to give you there's the the dig in MA the dig in PHA that you can find and then they test there but they're both sham but they they disappear and then you've got to find them somewhere else which i think is cool instead of just standing there all the time I think they I think they nailed that part of the DLC I think I agree with Greg I was expecting one new Galera inform of an old Pokemon and that was a huge bummer but no no you guys gotta answer this one question for me okay okay when I first got if you're gonna call it the Diglett bridge fine I first got to the Diglett bridge there's this lady standing on there and I go to talk to her and she says man there's so many amazing and wonderful Pokemon that you can see in this world do you want to give me a hundred watts so I can show you one of these amazing Pokemon oh yeah sure I want to see an amazing pokemon and she's like here's a fungus okay fine [Laughter] I want to show you an amazing Pokemon that you've never seen before I'm like yeah show me it's a Dunsparce and I went through the RAM idol the miltank and I wasn't involved and then I was like okay this is like the once a day lady cuz she disappeared what today I went back to the Diglett bridge and she's not there yes she's somewhere else yeah she's somewhere else oh so that's like the the other lady who's like I have Pokemon from another region would you give me garyun yeah what exciting thing are you gonna give me and she gives me a regular mr. yeah yep she wanders around to I will just say one thing I did do a miltank raid and that was disturbing nice look there's nothing nothing dumber than seeing a goofy spawn in the wild and man I was I was pumped no no no I was pop there's nothing dumber than seeing a licky licky licky next one in the wild ok cuz that's good strutting around with his tongue hanging out I thought zark was only in raids no yeah no he he spawn is that I then I ran into one I'm like oh heck sweet it would have been cool if they like he disguised himself as something else but yeah yeah true maybe future games ok so these are some of the features out and lock as you as you progress I don't think they're super spoilery we we kind of said that this DLC was very competitive focus and it is I mean like Hershey vu is a come like straight-up VGC competitive Monde or both singles and doubles I don't know if it will be like top 10 Pokemon because it's I think it's special defense that is actually not that great but all of its move sets are specifically designed to shake up the meta of the game and but they do so much for competitive here so there's a point where you can talk to mustards wife honey and she will arrest her yeah boy she's a she's a she pushes the line of reading between the lines with some of the things she says anyways they they do something in a Pokemon game which kind of done in the past but because I think black and white had an upgrade system but you can upgrade your dojo and you can add new things to the dojo by paying her watts so like a basic one is you can add a salon to the dojo so you can do your hair and right in the salon but one of the closer to endgame things is a vitamin machine so you can upgrade it three times each time is two different vitamins like iron and carbo stand protein and HP up or whatever and not only does it add a vitamin machine right into the dojo that you can walk up to and buy from it adds bulk buying vitamins you can buy one five ten or twenty five not only that is it's discounted for you when you buy them they've they've lowered the bar even more and again it's also a way to and you see this a lot with deal you see this a lot with like third versions like platinum or ultrason ultrasonic you know D axis and auras or all of these other legendaries and ultrasone altra moon like here is something for you for buying the game and here's like the Rotom boost to make experience easier or hatching easier like they do that they've done this in third part that in third game so to do like here if you want to get in the competitive you want to raise your Pokemon not only is this a way to buy bulk vitamins but we're discounting them and they're right here right in this machine right next to like the the vending machine is right next to a dude that will teach you new moves some really interesting moves like I don't do competitive but the fear that I've seen I'm like oh cool that sounds interesting yeah like they added a instead of volts which they added like an aqua switch which is pretty cool and then in the kitchen they have a place for you to buy food for camping but they also have the ability so you can hand in your max mushrooms and your max honey for max soup again another competitive feature of being like you know I caught this five I be perfect gar boater it sucks that I can't use it because it's a I can't Giganta max it but now I can with max soup they've done that they have the dojo in the back which I believe has some more stuff to it and that's that's the part I actually haven't done yet is the you know post dojo stuff that you can do but all of these all of these things geared towards competitive you can find mints on Islands now the cram maduk is pretty good for competitive you can put four rare candies in it to get an ability capsule you can put four bottle caps in it to get a golden bottle cap do not put four golden bottle caps in it disappointed so I don't know if any of I don't know if any of that convinces somebody to get into competitive I think it probably does at like a lower level for people to be like oh okay um maybe I will buy some vitamins maybe I will turn your Pokemon the huge thing oh sorry go ahead I just think that it helps friends who are into competitive guide their friends into getting in competitive like it helps make that entry lower so they could say Oh buy these but like they gain tell them what to do and it seems very doable all in one place instead of flying to like six different towns you get everything like go here and then they go here and they go here the other huge thing that they didn't even talk about and and for I guess we thought they revealed their hand this was cool in the old battle tower in in windin they added a guy he's standing like right by the doors and what he will do is he will look at any of your Pokemon that are not sword and shield and he will make them competitive and battle ready for actual tournaments so if you caught a shiny Charmander in in Ruby and Sapphire and you got a bunch of ribbons on it and he was your bud and you moved him to heartgold SoulSilver and you walked with them and then you moved them into sword and shield after jumping through the hoops of black and white and Pokemon bank and Pokemon home and getting it in the sword and shield you can take a Charmander that you caught in original Ruby you can talk to this guy he will say I want to delete all the moves but in doing so you can use this in competitive battle and he will he will put a new symbol next to the sword and shield symbol next to the shiny symbol in your info and you can now use that Charmander competitively you can even take that Charmander to the area for max soup and you can make that Charmander have the ability to Giganta max that's pretty sweet that's that's unexpected and yes like that just the fact that I can now bring over all those teams that I built when I was doing a lot of competitive stuff and just have them for fun and everything I that I'm very excited like I built two completely shiny completely ready teams in ultra Sun ultra moon and it was fun to build them and it was fun to breed for them and it was fun to SOS for them and I had definitely had more fun building the team than doing the battles but like the one Pokemon I would want to use is the like the shiny Litton in a sinner or that I bred for ultra Sun all ultra moon and I was like oh okay well you know I guess I can just use a regular in center or this time I don't need to go through all the work to breed another shiny and sinner or that's fine I already have one but now I can take that one I can delete all the moves I can get the little symbol I can now get that ribbon on that in sin Aurora in the master or the sorry the ranked battle ribbon it's such a cool feature that they didn't talk about they didn't show it even during they they just didn't tell anyone it was literally somebody discovered it posted it on social media and then everyone else was like oh my gosh look at this feature this is cool and again it just kind of piggybacks on this whole dlc being very I mean look there's lots of things to do but the the core of it was you know developing your teams and and you know getting more more battle-ready stuff but there there's I'm very happy with the DLC I don't think it's perfect but I was I was very worried based on DLCs of other games that this was very easy for Game Freak to mess up and I don't think they did and some of the new clothes are super sweet I feel like the clothes alone are worth the 15 bucks I so don't I'm still wearing my gray hoodie whole three-piece suit in the DLC I wear hoodies you can get a whole black suit you can be business will not gonna happen I don't poke him on battle in a suit you can get a hot pink suit coat a black turtleneck and hot pink suit pants you can get in and be the super gay Steve Jobs of the gallery you can get at home you can get a choker if you're into that yeah no wait Craig didn't you wear a pink suit for your wedding I did well there you go that's your deal if it wasn't hot pink no okay I am I am wearing the punk pink vest right now with the ultra ball guy shirt and the collar there and I got and I got I got chairman roses hair for a while because it doesn't look bad I was disappointed in the spiked Mohawk color right coloring because I was gonna do that but I didn't like how the colors looked yeah they added three new hairstyles for the boys yeah did they add shield Burt and sortie on no hopefully cross over hopefully crown Tundra I'm so mad they added man bun yeah they added the donate force that on you would you what you put the the dojo uniform on my hair is changed just to talk about this IGN casey from IGN she was the one that reviewed sword and shield originally i think she gave it like an 8 out of 10 or something if i remember she was able to play the dlc 30 minutes early on monday and apparently she asked nintendo if the game scales with your level and nintendo said yes and that was it and I looked at that tweet and I was like mm I don't know if this means what people think it means but people were like all week on Twitch not all week the two days before the DLC came out people were like what team do you plan on going with and I was like what do you mean and they were like well Nintendo said that it scales levels so what what six Pokemon are you bringing and I was like I'm just probably gonna bring my level 100 shiny cram around and nothing else because didn't pokemons not a hard game but yeah yeah I'm there with you they're like well they said it's going to scale so everything you're gonna see is level 100 but I was like I don't think so because do we know what it means or can I speculate no we do know what it means what it means is if you do not be Leon the DLC accepts that you have not beaten the game so when you go into the DLC everything is level 20 yup okay and if you know do you beat Leon when you go into the DLC everything starts at 62 and then goes up to I think the final hardest thing I thought was like 78 yeah so true the whole wild area farce again oh we're not gonna tell you this but if you pass this trigger everything's going to jump in level yeah so you could ideally purchase sword and shield make it to the wild area by the time you get to the wild area you should be about fifteen sixteen seventeen because Milo I think is eighteen and twenty and then instead of going to Milo you could go to the island of armor and experience all that content and I think that is a good way to do it mm-hm and myself I'm not disappointed or upset I don't want to fight or catch level 100 Pokemon like like I cheated I just don't wanna like fate because that means like if a Pokemon is a higher level than you it's harder to run away and it's harder to catch it and I don't want to deal with that and there are barely any trainers to fight in this DLC besides specific dojo stuff and making those dojo Pokemon level 100 does it make it harder it just means instead of me one-shotting them I probably have to 2-shot them like that's all it does I'm sure that is a minor gripe that people had but there has to be yeah do you do you actually want to play a Pokemon game where you have to have level 100's on your team just to navigate the world uh I don't know no I think I think them being at sixty is fine they give you the experience charm right away and all that all that means is you're getting more experience per catch or per defeat so again another quality of life it's almost like a built-in roto it's literally a built-in roto XP for this game yeah if you complete the pokédex we talked about this but you'll get the mark charm I think the one of the data miners said that ideally to get a rare mark is like one in five so to get the rarest mark is one in a thousand to get a I think they called it a like a social mark like like not the so not the actual social mark but like the more rare marks that aren't the rare mark it's like 1 in 500 and then like the morning slash dusts clash night mark that you can get is like 1 in 50 and then the uncommon mark the mark that is actually common is like 1 in 25 so anyways they posted the the chance of getting a mark and the mark charm just is like the shiny charm it just adds +2 so instead of 1 in 25 or one in a thousand it's 3 + 25 or 3 and a thousand so that's all that does if you want to complete that pokedex you do get another stamp on your trainer card to of completing the armor the isle of armor pokedex so a lot of things to work for in the dlc but i think i think it's good and i think it i think of anything it also sets my expectations for the next one like I can't imagine the crown Tundra to be bigger although if it's the same size or slightly smaller I think that's awesome because I think the island of armors a lot bigger than we expected and I guess I'm not expecting any new Pokemon because or any new gallery' informs because this DLC didn't come with any but if there is that would be pleasant but I'm not gonna expect it you never know never never know you never know but I think it's good I think I think they did it I think this is better than a third version by far I love me my third friction so I'm not gonna go in that mark yeah let me see the other half and then I'll make my statement on whether I would have rather have seen a third version hmm yeah I feel like this is this is it for me as somebody who has like 100 plus bottle caps and Oh grand all those items though they also we didn't talk about this they also make you use your watts so as somebody who was who I was I had 2.5 million watts and I was hoarding them and people were like what are you gonna do with them I was like I don't know yet I just I just want them I don't understand why mr. and mrs. mustards son is like I need 500 watts to get this garbage can with a beak to operate but that's far too men like dude all you need to do is walk up to three dead what are you that early three outside of your door door okay hold up before we talk about the cran BOTS that's the last thing we got to talk about the game does make you use those watts for the dojo and I think that's good and there's a and and they do good of making it easy to get other items slash give you a way to throw away items that you don't need anymore into the cran box so I felt like sword and shield did have a currency problem of like what am I gonna do that guy literally done it like I could spend these watts I guess on luxury balls and I can sell these luxury balls for money I can use them down to my vitamin C's you use like I do not have 2.5 million watts well look that hi honey needs a lot of watts to upgrade that dojo so you gotta you guys start grinding but the watt but like getting watts encourages you to do raids encourages you to explore like the true they are trying to get this cycle of balance of well if I'm going out to this island to get the Watts I can also get a mint out here I can also shake a tree mmm-hmm that was something that I did every day and sword and shield and I know I'm an exception but when people came into my stream and they're like how do you have five hundred Perry's how do you have two million watts it's like that's that's my first 10 minutes of my stream is I just check all the trees check all the dens and then at the end of stream I do the same thing and that's just the habit I got into and now I'm exhausted in watts but in the I love Armour not only do they make that not only does it make that circle of you know tasks you have to do make a little bit more sense but they also scattered you know items that you would want to collect like the mints on the ground out in the islands and stuff so they're somewhat balancing their economy which i think is hard to do in any game cram o matic or I call it the scam o matic scam you attic gam scam scam buddy scam scam APRA cornballs returned there here uh did they and done that yet remember when we were like let's set expectations for this but I don't know there was a bunch of people that thought they were gonna be sitting in a bathtub of friend balls because of this expansion and it doesn't seem to be the case scam o matic can turn four items into an item protip get a pro controller or sorry get a turbo controller and start handing in your Dynomax candy if you can't sell it and you can't throw it away and if you're gonna be doing a bunch of raids you're gonna get more than max candy I think for Dynomax candy is one dragon Fang and then I think one dragon Fang and two Dynomax candy is a wishing piece so you can grind that out there's there's some there's some avi there's some nice combinations like form little mushrooms is one big mushroom and a big mushroom sells for like four times the price so you'd want to convert those before you sell them but while a lot of things have formulas like flame or dubious disk rare candy like there are formulas for these things some do not have formulas that are guaranteed like the APRA corn balls so I have put in probably 20 plus APRA corns into the scam o matic and i have not gotten the best thing i got was a great ball in return yep it is possible to get love balls and fred balls and even safari ball is possible but it seems to be random no matter what APRA corns you put in it doesn't guarantee anything my question is i walk what is mini mustard what what's his name does he have a first name no mustard his name is hyde hy de hide mustard okay so i went up to him and he's like would you give me a hundred watts to get a recipe and I was like sure and then he gave me a recipe and it was nothing I wanted but fine is that written down though or me any lower or was I supposed to be writing that down while he came down oh good gracious there was a waste of a hundred watts right oh don't worry well I did it about 30 times in a row because I thought it was animal crossing and I was like oh I'm gonna stock up on these recipes oh no remember the ball embelove DIY card with an acorn ah yeah I was open I was open haha get rekt Pokemon loves adding they're like extremely nerdy computer character and PC in their games they really love that trope some something about it but it's like so I mean I did the schematic once and I was just like I all right so my daily tradition now is when I first wake up in the morning and I go and I have my coffee and I play sword and I always start in what is the village that's all the way on the west side where they had this don't mural before it got destroyed and the statues was hiding behind it that town stone sigh yeah yeah and then as the so the first things I walk up to the guy he's like I want to buy something and it's like well I probably have it for you to buy and then I sell it to him and get some money and then I walked to the next guy and he's like I want to sell you something and it's like I buy it I don't even care how many of them I have it especially since they announced achromatic I'm like I'm buying them all because I'm just gonna throw them all away so anyways I have a bunch of extras of sharp beaks and black sludge and whatever you have you Reaper cloths has ones like eggs like alright here's four things where I have extras I'll throw them in the chromatic and blingy block it pops out a little glowy ball and then it says you got a satchel no no this is the thought that I immediately had because this is like the one time I used it that's the one thing I got and Steve you cursed me because that's literally what you said last week was I hope it doesn't give me a satchel I mean I want the listeners to go back to last week's episode and find that moment because it's so true and it's so like I don't even want to touch that thing anymore I put in for rare bones and got a wishing piece hey there you go I mean the the cram o matic is no Kurt Kurt knows how to craft a quality pokeball the cram o matic does not so putting four black peppercorns in you know you're probably gonna get timer ball ninety-nine times at a hundred and then maybe get a safari ball or something and there are no recipes for for APRA corns it seems like pudding for a / corns is the way to get a nap record ball but it I seen hide says that he says if you put four APRA corns in you'll get it all but yeah it seems random and I just don't like I think it's fine I mean like they don't think it's fine what is that they want these pokeballs to be rare yet you still have to put four in of a kind but you can't wait seven from a tree when you shake it yeah well if you're lucky and a variety of colors if you had to put in four of one color to get that one ball you're gonna burn through those things pretty quick you know I honestly think the crema maddox not about the APRA corns that that's that is like the second or like they add on I honestly think that in sword and shield they made it too easy to get those kinds of held items battle items and they're like we've got to find a way for people to be able to offload these and this this is their solution to that and then they're like oh well now we've got this let's do a pre-chorus to and get all those fools who are in love rap with a procore n--'s to buy our deal to see cuz they think they're gonna get something good and we said this on the show before but like they they clearly understand that people love these pokeballs they don't include them in every game they've they've given away these APRA corn balls as like downloads of like mystery gifts and people go nuts for them they're like I want that I don't even care about the gallery' and Pony - I want the one bonus love ball and lore ball I get like to me it seems like they just want to keep them semi special and make them rare in the case of like you know if you if you shook every tree every day you're probably gonna have like 40 APRA corns maybe not all the same colors but if that's giving if whatever the ratio is we don't know if it's like a one in ten chance of one in 20 chance of 100 if you're walking away with one or two a day I think that's pretty good and it's still keeping it rare and it just goes back to like it is not exciting to get droopy and wonder trade it or it's not exciting to get Dunsparce and wonder trade it is exciting to get like oh man I don't really like Dunsparce that much but I got a Dunsparce and a fastball that's actually pretty cool like that's that's like the only thing that's at this point I feel like encouraging trading is is once you catch all the Pokemon now it's like well I don't have the Pokemon in my favorite pokeball and my favorite pokeball is friend ball or something well you know it's an easy thing to do make it so that we can change the pokeball our Pokemon is in come on tundra come on count under at least for the ones that are a gift that come in a boring old pokeball let me put it into the brief and breeding center and say was in there could you just swap out just thanks umm I think that the app recording things just it's an artificial limit I think if you could get a guaranteed one or two a per cornballs a day you would have a lot of people since they see it so special engaging in your game everyday as it is it's a it's a gambling thing and only gamblers are gonna like that and everybody else be like we don't we don't we don't know if there's a better way to do it though because he doesn't tell us the formula so if you know in like a week you know Bulbul PD or something says like actually putting four of the same color is less of a chance and if you put three black in one white it's a better chance like we don't we don't know if that's the case at this point so I think we I think we just gotta wait on that I mean keep in mind it took people almost a full month I think it took three weeks to figure out actually how wormhole worked so I think we just maybe need a little bit more time the scam o matic does do good things though like the mushrooms - the big mushroom is a positive getting rid of your Dynomax candy is a positive for rare candy into ability or ability capsule positive for bottle caps into a golden bog cap super big positive like they're like it's the the whole the whole robot is not a lost cause almost it's almost Alaska but again that that that also helps people competitively right you know you you know as a competitive battler you probably don't need your rare candy you just need only be level 50 you need you probably want the ability capsule or you probably want the golden bottle cap more so there are defined formulas well in support of competitive again yeah but if okay so if you're not in competitive if you have to dig let's stuff to do you have the entire wild area to do which i think is a huge i don't think that's a huge positi one complaining about this new whale wow there is more more pokemon to find and catch heck it's better than the new pokemon snap where it's just fine to take a picture of it um I'm curious you have the story to do I'm curious if they I think the the thing that they could do that they won't do but the thing that they could do is they could say like hey this summer as we're waiting between these two DLCs now because I don't think there's enough content in the DLC to take us into fall I really don't I think there's enough Conville there's an immune I think you'll see the change in the competition's is what we get as our bat content and yeah maybe like the engagement there right I mean like if we were going from like Sun and Moon to ultra Sun and Moon you know most people fell off Sun and Moon or even let's go most people fell off both those games they came out in November they fell off I would say February March and then there was nothing to do so we're very lucky that sword and shield has been somewhat of a living game they have rotated raids out every month they have done quite a few mystery gifts and now they gave us this DLC but I can't help but think like why go back to the old wild area when this wild area is more fun to explore and maybe it's because it's like we're still in the honeymoon period of it but I feel like the thing they could do is update the old wild area or update the original Galler to you know make that while it might change the spawns of the wild area fix the trees or whatever something silly make Pokemon follow you as like a free update to everyone to not only push more people to the DLC to be like hey look come back to the game for free we've did this free update and tons up Nintendo games do this tons of like splatoon Super Mario maker those are the only two that come to mind but they have these free updates that people can come back to to explore and then also push their $30 DLC like there is still whether or not there's a new game next year or next month or in two weeks they still have there they're still not done with the current product which is this $30 package that they need to continue to push into the holidays to sell right like they got one half done they're not going to not market the other half until it's shipped like they want to sell this into the holidays so I think that I think that's more of a goodwill thing if anything to be like hey we're updating some features we're fixing some issues come back to the game for free and if you're interested we're advertising the DLC in the menu I don't know if though they'll do that I doubt it but I think I still think there's a little bit of goodwill they can do for players who players who are still on the fence and I'm sure there's lots of them out there and I'm not talking about the National dexter's they're not in the fence there they could they could say every Pokemon is coming back they're all following you and we've put the best tree graphics in the world on these games those players are still not going to purchase the game but there are plenty of players that will walk into the store this November they just got a switch or they're getting a switch and they're like I like Pokemon I heard this game was pretty okay and then I'll purchase it I heard they added a robot that scams you I'm into this I'm in AI I liked being scammed and I want to give it all my best items to get a worse item back hey I got 164 moonstones see what that cream gives me and I do have those slowly tough get a Wigglytuff army coming let's see what that cream gives me shout out to drew for bringing up the NPC in the battle tower almost forgot it but it was in the Attic channel here well we'll hold off on question the week I think we talked enough today so will give us our Pokemon of the week alright last week's Pokemon of the week was based on the very popular Pokemon Trading Card Game so folks who are familiar with the Pokemon Trading Card Game would have had an advantage knowing about things like Pokemon that have to evolve because their stage basics and stage ones and stage twos and and how that works and this particular Pokemon had a one attack called for one fire energy called Super singe it does 20 damage flicks the burn condition and then its flavor text says it uses ceilings and walls to launch aerial attacks but it's fiery tail is but one weapon and then I made the joke that I said it's not one but weapon and I'd still love that and then uh yeah and in its stage to form because this is the stage one has the ability flaming fighter where you put six damage counters instead of to on your opponent's burn Pokemon between turns who's that Pokemon it's you wow Monferno I'm Inferno correct it is mine Farah no I figured I'd give it to Steve because you know TCG is not my thing yet Here I am he's so wise once again Monferno has been a recent card it was in Sun and Moon ultra prism yeah my bet which I believe is still in rotation maybe I think ultra prism still is yeah Monferno shares its category with Pancham they are both known as the playful Pokemon that's your only trivia are cute is the ultra what as ultra prism is that a good set Steve would you open packs of ultra prism no I mean I'll take all through prism over XY evolutions and burning shadows I think ultra prism only has alternate rows ma I think that's all it has that's good at this point I said nope no boss's orders no interest yeah no boss's orders No Deal Remo boxes or dude na GX I'm out yeah get that trainer kit and hope that's why I always bring without a trainer kids that's what we talked about it last we has bosses and cards for cheap that's right not on par I think that's that card maybe thirty dollars okay it's all coming back to me now this week's Pokemon of the week will be much easier for Gregg because it is not based in the very popular game the Pokemon Trading Card Game still I got it right yes congratulations all right here we go groove on tazed field guide to pokemon visual identification has this to say about to this week's pokemon next to its image the japanese refer to this insect as pen drawer coming from Scolopendra the astute viewer will note that as this creature has unfurled from its previous form the coloring of its rings and background have been exchanged while previously it was primarily purple with magenta rings it is now primarily magenta with light purple rings coming from the pede family of pokemon its predecessors the centipede Pokemon and the curl of heat Pokemon the now mega pede Pokemon actually only stands on four of its feet holding the other eight up in the air to also appear to be vestigial across its midsection if you do come across this Pokemon use care it does carry a poison point and has been known to swarm it used to have quick feet but that has not been seen outside of you Nova while it can easily be confused for ascenta scorch it does not have any flames its coloring is similar to Dre peons but the feelers extending from its head are much smaller also make certain to note the many similarities to Giratina and there you go that's this week's Pokemon taken straight from Grove aunties field guide to Pokemon visual identification that's just not a good thing yeah it is and trying to find Monferno shuffle well hopefully you enjoyed the show hopefully made it to the end I will continue to be streaming the sword and shield DLC if you're worried about stories spoilers I'm done with it so you can come and stream knowing that I'll probably just be just wandering a booth hunt

charm too so we'll see if we get a bunch of marks also my boxes are a huge mess again still want to get that Magee Rinna I think I have until August 7th because I think that's when the ads are rude to the game and I don't know what's gonna I don't even know if you can get the Magee erna anymore I know home updated which we didn't talk about they said they'd fix some stuff but we got next week long
