about at the beginning of the the (1:15 - 1:19)
pokemon (1:18 - 1:21)
super effective podcast slack (1:19 - 1:25)
communities about 2015 time years (1:21 - 1:28)
a few friends decided to come together (1:25 - 1:29)
to form (1:28 - 1:32)
a special society (1:29 - 1:33)
that was known (1:32 - 1:35)
at the time and has been known (1:33 - 1:37)
throughout (1:35 - 1:41)
as the zigzag swag club oh yeah (1:37 - 1:43)
and it was a club (1:41 - 1:45)
for people who (1:43 - 1:47)
had captured or (1:45 - 1:51)
bred a shiny zig zagoon (1:47 - 1:54)
and you know you didn't evolve it (1:51 - 1:55)
because if you evolved it you became a (1:54 - 1:57)
lanoon goon you were kicked out of the (1:55 - 1:58)
club (1:57 - 2:01)
but it was it was a special place and (1:58 - 2:03)
and i'm here to announce today that the (2:01 - 2:04)
zigzag (2:03 - 2:08)
zigzag swag club is over (2:04 - 2:10)
when everybody can have a shiny (2:08 - 2:11)
zigzagoon (2:10 - 2:14)
there's no need for a club anymore (2:11 - 2:17)
so everyone in my three-hour window (2:14 - 2:19)
everybody had a three-hour window but i (2:17 - 2:22)
caught what 12 of them i (2:19 - 2:26)
can distribute freely yeah now (2:22 - 2:27)
i mean this is the equality that we want (2:26 - 2:29)
for we don't need your elks club (2:27 - 2:32)
nonsense in this world (2:29 - 2:34)
that's fine go on all right that that's (2:32 - 2:37)
my stuff is out of the way greg uh we (2:34 - 2:38)
have a (2:37 - 2:42)
lot of pokemon news uh the pokemon world (2:38 - 2:44)
well i guess we'll just i will just (2:42 - 2:46)
we'll start i guess the pokemon world (2:44 - 2:49)
championships is this upcoming weekend (2:46 - 2:51)
uh i will be there i will be i (2:49 - 2:53)
apparently i didn't get the memo uh (2:51 - 2:55)
people are traveling this weekend to go (2:53 - 2:58)
i'm i guess i'm doing travel wrong i (2:55 - 2:59)
always think (2:58 - 3:02)
you get there the day before the event (2:59 - 3:05)
and then you add extra days after it (3:02 - 3:07)
seems like it's the other way where (3:05 - 3:11)
people add extra days before the event (3:07 - 3:13)
but (3:11 - 3:13)
i feel like the the traveling (3:14 - 3:18)
immediately after the event is where er (3:16 - 3:20)
what is everyone is doing and that's why (3:18 - 3:21)
like you add the extra days after (3:20 - 3:22)
because then you have to deal with the (3:21 - 3:25)
airport issue of like everyone trying to (3:22 - 3:27)
but if you add the days before you deal (3:25 - 3:29)
with your jet lag so you're bright and (3:27 - 3:32)
sprightly when the actual event comes oh (3:29 - 3:34)
see if you have that problem yeah you do (3:32 - 3:36)
no you don't have a problem because you (3:34 - 3:37)
you because (3:36 - 3:40)
yeah your sleep schedule is a nightmare (3:37 - 3:43)
you are up until four (3:40 - 3:45)
and then you'll text me and you're like (3:43 - 3:48)
why aren't you up and i'm like i'm a (3:45 - 3:50)
normal human and i'm dead during those (3:48 - 3:52)
times when i'm until four that i could (3:50 - 3:54)
at least say good morning to will before (3:52 - 3:56)

i don't have jet lag is i get on (3:59 - 4:04)
everybody else's normal schedule and (4:01 - 4:06)

whether it's in authentic synthetic or (8:38 - 8:42)
uh (8:41 - 8:44)
what is what's the other one not the not (8:42 - 8:46)

called (8:49 - 8:52)
it is called phony yeah (8:50 - 8:54)
that's waffle i think it's not (8:52 - 8:56)
technically called it (8:54 - 8:58)
uh authentic i think it's called antique (8:56 - 8:59)
and then i think the other one's called (8:58 - 9:01)
phony (8:59 - 9:04)
oh the poor sinister it's it's a real (9:01 - 9:06)
dynasty (9:04 - 9:06)
it went to the wrong cup i'm gonna (9:06 - 9:11)
assume that it's antique (9:09 - 9:15)
uh i would not make that assumption (9:11 - 9:17)
here i thought they were gonna say he's (9:15 - 9:19)
gonna finally know the special (9:17 - 9:21)
move scald (9:19 - 9:22)
because it is still wild to me that a (9:21 - 9:24)
cup of tea (9:22 - 9:27)
does not know scald it would it would (9:24 - 9:31)
make it too powerful true how (9:27 - 9:31)
the (9:31 - 9:37)
the type coverage that it would get (9:32 - 9:37)
celebrates celebrating school i (9:38 - 9:42)
celebrate fine i have like a number of (9:40 - 9:44)
celebrates somewhere in my mini (9:42 - 9:45)
collections (9:44 - 9:48)
uh celebrate the 2022 pokemon world (9:45 - 9:51)
championships in pokemon go um (9:48 - 9:52)
[Music] (9:51 - 9:53)
obviously the world championships will (9:52 - 9:55)
take place from eight the 18th to the (9:53 - 9:57)
21st london england at the excel center (9:55 - 9:59)
uh the top qualifying pokemon go players (9:57 - 10:01)
around the world (9:59 - 10:03)
to determine who will be crowned will (10:01 - 10:05)
get an exclusive in-game world (10:03 - 10:08)
championship outfit and pose (10:05 - 10:10)
i think that's actually really cool (10:08 - 10:12)
for those players that end up winning so (10:10 - 10:14)
you can win unite you can win the vgc (10:12 - 10:17)
the tcg pokemon go (10:14 - 10:19)
i'm assuming that would be the same for (10:17 - 10:21)
the five people playing pokken (10:19 - 10:24)
tournament they got oh yeah (10:21 - 10:25)
but they they get this cool outfit (10:24 - 10:27)
that's like them holding the trophy and (10:25 - 10:30)
they spin so (10:27 - 10:32)
i don't know what the i would assume for (10:30 - 10:35)
the pokemon go players (10:32 - 10:37)
very very great i don't know if there's (10:35 - 10:39)
a huge crossover of like vgc players (10:37 - 10:42)
that they're probably a vg somebody who (10:39 - 10:44)
wins the vgc or tcg tournament who also (10:42 - 10:46)
is a big go player then conflicts that (10:44 - 10:49)
in raids i would hope or and or assume (10:46 - 10:50)
that (10:49 - 10:52)
that's the case (10:50 - 10:55)
i feel like if there's any crossover if (10:52 - 10:56)
there's any crossover pokemon game that (10:55 - 10:58)
i feel like everyone plays that's (10:56 - 11:00)
probably go it's like the easiest to (10:58 - 11:02)
pick up and (11:00 - 11:04)
play i would agree (11:02 - 11:07)
uh you'll be able to watch all of these (11:04 - 11:10)
matches on the uh pokemon go twitch (11:07 - 11:11)
channel slash (11:10 - 11:14)
pokemon channel slash pokemon tcg (11:11 - 11:15)
channel (11:14 - 11:18)
there will be two new in-game avatar (11:15 - 11:20)
items available for (11:18 - 11:23)
commemoration of the 2022 world (11:20 - 11:25)
championships there is a world t (11:23 - 11:28)
available globally via a code that will (11:25 - 11:30)
be shared during they really want people (11:28 - 11:32)
to watch these streams they're sharing (11:30 - 11:34)
codes left and right there will be a (11:32 - 11:35)
code shared during the world (11:34 - 11:37)
championship stream the code will be (11:35 - 11:39)
distributed on the official pokemon go (11:37 - 11:41)
media channel shortly after code is (11:39 - 11:44)
valid until august 22nd (11:41 - 11:46)
that is the (11:44 - 11:47)
blue (11:46 - 11:50)
t-shirt that you better get two t-shirts (11:47 - 11:53)
and then if you're a participant (11:50 - 11:55)
uh (11:53 - 11:58)
available from pokestops located at the (11:55 - 12:00)
pokemon go booth in the world (11:58 - 12:01)
championships (12:00 - 12:05)
so if you visit a pokestop in london at (12:01 - 12:07)
the world championships i'm assuming you (12:05 - 12:09)
just have to spin it (12:07 - 12:11)
because that's what it says visit (12:09 - 12:14)
pokestop you will get a red tea (12:11 - 12:18)
um which i think is the (12:14 - 12:20)
second time they did this the first time (12:18 - 12:24)
they did this was that north face (12:20 - 12:24)
thing where you had to go to a north (12:25 - 12:30)
face store to spin and then we at least (12:27 - 12:32)
on twitter people were like (12:30 - 12:34)
there are no north face i can't get to (12:32 - 12:36)
it i can't (12:34 - 12:39)
like i consider drive i think i was in (12:36 - 12:40)
milwaukee at the time and i considered (12:39 - 12:41)
driving (12:40 - 12:45)
to chicago to spin a pokestop to get a (12:41 - 12:47)
shirt that i really didn't care about (12:45 - 12:50)
that much (12:47 - 12:50)
i believe there was one about three (12:51 - 12:56)
miles south of me and i still didn't (12:54 - 12:58)
bother to go (12:56 - 13:00)
but then at a certain point they gave (12:58 - 13:02)
the shirts to like everyone (13:00 - 13:05)
it was just a code you had to enter (13:02 - 13:06)
so (13:05 - 13:08)
the north face one wasn't that big of a (13:06 - 13:11)
deal but they're doing it again if (13:08 - 13:12)
you're there (13:11 - 13:14)
in the london area you can reach the (13:12 - 13:16)
pokemon go booth you spin it you should (13:14 - 13:17)
get a red shirt slightly different than (13:16 - 13:19)
the blue shirt blue shirt should be (13:17 - 13:20)
available to everyone but you will have (13:19 - 13:22)
to enter a code (13:20 - 13:23)

elite fast tm the elite charge team (14:29 - 14:33)
these are the tms they usually charge (14:32 - 14:38)
for uh community boxes the scan boxes (14:33 - 14:38)
uh (14:38 - 14:42)

are all available in the wild during (14:45 - 14:49)
this event these are all pokemon well (14:47 - 14:52)
maybe the exception of manky that are (14:49 - 14:54)
pretty okay competitively (14:52 - 14:56)
i shouldn't say pretty okay like mudkip (14:54 - 14:59)
stable i meditate swab loose feel dupe (14:56 - 15:01)
dupid or like those are all really (14:59 - 15:04)
really good competitively (15:01 - 15:04)
aren't they based off people who use (15:04 - 15:07)
them in (15:06 - 15:10)
yeah well battle league (15:07 - 15:13)
is that what you just said these are the (15:10 - 15:14)
ones available no the trainers will be (15:13 - 15:16)
the trainers based off the people who (15:14 - 15:19)
won regionals in go battle league oh (15:16 - 15:20)
okay see (15:19 - 15:22)
but i mean (15:20 - 15:24)
i'm assuming a primate probably won (15:22 - 15:26)
something but like at least from the (15:24 - 15:27)
recent tournaments i've watched i've (15:26 - 15:29)
never seen a primate i've seen all the (15:27 - 15:31)
other ones like but i'm assuming primate (15:29 - 15:33)
probably wants something (15:31 - 15:35)
uh one star raids will be the world (15:33 - 15:36)
championship pikachu gallery and (15:35 - 15:39)
farfetch merrell barboach (15:36 - 15:41)
timber scraggy three star will be (15:39 - 15:44)
primate liquor tongue skarmory lickitung (15:41 - 15:46)
and skirmer and are very good for gbl (15:44 - 15:48)
five star raids will be zashi and (15:46 - 15:51)
zamazenta cannot be shiny by the way and (15:48 - 15:56)
then uh mega raids will be mega slobro (15:51 - 15:56)
and there will be some new avatar items (15:58 - 16:03)
in the shop during this event as well i (16:00 - 16:04)
am wondering (16:03 - 16:05)
uh (16:04 - 16:07)
because we talked about this before if (16:05 - 16:10)
so at the last world championships which (16:07 - 16:11)
was in dc (16:10 - 16:14)
uh where they put relicanth and (16:11 - 16:17)
aerodactyl in (16:14 - 16:19)
field research that came from pokestops (16:17 - 16:21)
that you spun by just being in the area (16:19 - 16:23)
i wonder if there will be an increase of (16:21 - 16:24)
that (16:23 - 16:27)
that will just get you pikachu um (16:24 - 16:29)
in that area because they're not really (16:27 - 16:31)
saying anything else but they're they're (16:29 - 16:32)
not saying pikachu is spawning in the (16:31 - 16:34)
wild they're saying field research raids (16:32 - 16:35)
and (16:34 - 16:37)
timed research which is that (16:35 - 16:39)
do the task stuff (16:37 - 16:42)
so i'm i'm guessing that's how (16:39 - 16:44)
people in the area will have a better (16:42 - 16:49)
chance of getting shiny pikachu maybe (16:44 - 16:49)
probably (16:50 - 16:57)
yeah that's what i would assume (16:53 - 16:57)
uh the (16:58 - 17:04)
other bit of pokemon world's news (17:00 - 17:08)
is that this came out of nowhere (17:04 - 17:08)
what's up pokemon.com pokemon the arceus (17:08 - 17:13)

sinnoh champion cynthia by their side (17:57 - 18:01)
our heroes will have a lot of help but (17:59 - 18:05)
can they get through to save to know (18:01 - 18:08)
did they say how many episodes this was (18:05 - 18:08)
it can't be a lot (18:09 - 18:12)
i mean it's gotta be like three right (18:12 - 18:17)
three half an hour to make some a 90 (18:15 - 18:18)
minute movie because it sounds like a (18:17 - 18:20)
movie that was chopped up into episodes (18:18 - 18:21)
yes (18:20 - 18:24)
which is a very (18:21 - 18:27)
netflix thing i watched the whole movie (18:24 - 18:29)
on hbo max (18:27 - 18:32)
and that same movie is now on netflix as (18:29 - 18:35)
a tv show they just broke it into three (18:32 - 18:38)
episodes and i was like i get why they (18:35 - 18:40)
did that but like also it's just it's a (18:38 - 18:43)
movie this movie it was uh it was about (18:40 - 18:46)
woodstock 90 the the bad wood the the (18:43 - 18:49)
bad woods oh the bat it would suck (18:46 - 18:51)
yes (18:49 - 18:53)
yes it talks about why this was just a (18:51 - 18:56)
bad no no no no no there were two 90s (18:53 - 18:58)
woodstocks the first one was good the (18:56 - 19:01)
second one was bad the one with lid (18:58 - 19:03)
biscuit that's the battery yeah the one (19:01 - 19:04)
without the water where they ran out of (19:03 - 19:06)
water (19:04 - 19:08)
and i thought it was a great documentary (19:06 - 19:09)
and then i saw it on netflix and i was (19:08 - 19:12)
like didn't i see this on hbo and then i (19:09 - 19:13)
clicked on it i was like why is this (19:12 - 19:14)
three episodes and then i like looked (19:13 - 19:16)
and i was like (19:14 - 19:19)
i watched this this is a movie (19:16 - 19:22)
yeah how does the fire festival compare (19:19 - 19:26)
to the bad woodstock um (19:22 - 19:28)
i saw that documentary too (19:26 - 19:30)
where the fire festival didn't actually (19:28 - 19:32)
happen (19:30 - 19:34)
yes (19:32 - 19:34)
but weren't more people (19:35 - 19:39)
put out by the fire festival like did (19:37 - 19:42)
they get stranded that whole thing look (19:39 - 19:44)
let's not get into my whole so social (19:42 - 19:46)
commentary about what the fire festival (19:44 - 19:48)
has been because tick tock is not long (19:46 - 19:50)
enough for that (19:48 - 19:50)
yeah you're right greg it does sound (19:51 - 19:54)
like a movie that they oh it's four (19:52 - 19:55)
parts four yeah (19:54 - 19:57)
that's that's right because it's like uh (19:55 - 20:01)
an episode is usually 23 to 24 minutes (19:57 - 20:04)
right then that comes to about 92 (20:01 - 20:07)
minutes total (20:04 - 20:07)
um my thing is i what i saw because you (20:07 - 20:13)
know they felt the need to email me to (20:11 - 20:15)
let me know (20:13 - 20:15)
they won't email you codes but they'll (20:16 - 20:20)
tell you about a special coming up (20:18 - 20:22)
directly to let me know that this show (20:20 - 20:24)
was coming out (20:22 - 20:26)
and it looked like in the preview that (20:24 - 20:29)
they changed their clothes (20:26 - 20:33)
so it's like my suspicion is this is (20:29 - 20:35)
like a legends arceus (20:33 - 20:36)
um (20:35 - 20:37)
and they're gonna get transported to the (20:36 - 20:40)
past oh yeah there's there's i'm sure (20:37 - 20:43)
yeah it's very like (20:40 - 20:47)
we're going into the past to (20:43 - 20:48)
whatever i'm just happy that they're (20:47 - 20:50)
bringing back one of my favorite (20:48 - 20:52)
characters mae (20:50 - 20:52)
no they said dawn not me dawn i'm sorry (20:53 - 20:59)
oh boy you heard it here everybody (20:56 - 21:03)
you're gonna send your dad and mayor (20:59 - 21:03)
and you're like all over me (21:12 - 21:18)
wow one minute all it takes is one (21:15 - 21:20)
opening (21:18 - 21:22)
uh (21:20 - 21:22)
kind of worlds related because i'm (21:24 - 21:27)
because if you're going to worlds you'll (21:26 - 21:29)
be able to (21:27 - 21:30)
uh play (21:29 - 21:32)
with these cards early because they'll (21:30 - 21:34)
have like a pre-release set but this off (21:32 - 21:38)
pokemon.com hissuian zoroark v (21:34 - 21:39)
star and more (21:38 - 21:42)
uh in pokemon tcg sword and shield lost (21:39 - 21:44)
origin (21:42 - 21:47)
lost origin will release on september (21:44 - 21:48)
9th (21:47 - 21:50)
and it will feature (21:48 - 21:53)
over 190 cards (21:50 - 21:55)
which is a lot (21:53 - 21:57)
there's an aerodactyl v star there's a (21:55 - 22:00)
kingdra there's a mirage gate there's (21:57 - 22:02)
this there's a snorlax with pretty good (22:00 - 22:03)
art (22:02 - 22:05)
um (22:03 - 22:08)
this is very uh hissui a very jesuian (22:05 - 22:10)
set not we've gotten obviously jesus (22:08 - 22:13)
cards before but they're they're going (22:10 - 22:15)
they're going in even more (22:13 - 22:17)
if you thought they went in (22:15 - 22:19)
they're going in oh boy you were wrong (22:17 - 22:19)
they're (22:19 - 22:22)
doing it bigger now (22:19 - 22:24)
at worlds do they have the option for (22:22 - 22:27)
you to go do drafts and stuff like do (22:24 - 22:29)
you run events there they run a bunch of (22:27 - 22:32)
events there's a bunch of um (22:29 - 22:33)
sword and shield events too like there's (22:32 - 22:36)
a there's like a topsy curvy (22:33 - 22:39)
topsy turvy tournament where you play (22:36 - 22:40)
vgc but you have to hold your switch (22:39 - 22:43)
upside down (22:40 - 22:43)
okay so the judge's comments make more (22:44 - 22:48)
sense (22:46 - 22:50)
very confused (22:48 - 22:52)
but that makes more sense yeah they have (22:50 - 22:53)
they have a bunch of like silly (22:52 - 22:57)
tournaments and fun tournaments and (22:53 - 22:58)
you know (22:57 - 23:00)
retro tournaments and (22:58 - 23:02)
normal tournaments that yes they do have (23:00 - 23:06)
normal tournaments drafts vgc (23:02 - 23:07)
things but (23:06 - 23:09)
at every worlds they they always do have (23:07 - 23:11)
a pre-release of the new set so you'll (23:09 - 23:12)
be able to do like the battle box which (23:11 - 23:14)
i think is (23:12 - 23:16)
gosh how much is a battle box now 35 i (23:14 - 23:17)
think which is you get like a a (23:16 - 23:19)
pre-constructed deck and then you get (23:17 - 23:21)
like six boosters and then you open the (23:19 - 23:22)
boosters and you customize your deck and (23:21 - 23:25)
then you play usually like three rounds (23:22 - 23:27)
against somebody um and then if you win (23:25 - 23:29)
you get like two extra boosters or (23:27 - 23:31)
whatever just for like winning if you (23:29 - 23:32)
don't win i mean like you still paid for (23:31 - 23:34)
six boosters you keep all that stuff (23:32 - 23:36)
yeah when you're done yeah i love and (23:34 - 23:40)
hate the battle box it's amazing yeah (23:36 - 23:42)
i mean i okay i'm gonna do my story now (23:40 - 23:45)
because we're talking about it so (23:42 - 23:48)
they should have max raid battles as (23:45 - 23:49)
well at (23:48 - 23:52)
which is what i did at gen con so max (23:49 - 23:53)
rate battery battle (23:52 - 23:55)
is (23:53 - 23:58)
where up to five people (23:55 - 24:01)
take on a big pokemon are those four (23:58 - 24:03)
well (24:01 - 24:05)
look a lot of people signed up so we had (24:03 - 24:08)
five okay i'm gonna tell you the pros (24:05 - 24:10)
and cons of this whole situation (24:08 - 24:12)
so i (24:10 - 24:15)
can a little like clarification this is (24:12 - 24:18)
like tcg this is tcg max ray bell so (24:15 - 24:21)
which we talked about like eight months (24:18 - 24:23)
ago yeah maybe a year ago that it was a (24:21 - 24:26)
print and play off pokemon.com that you (24:23 - 24:28)
could do yeah (24:26 - 24:30)
so the max raid battle is (24:28 - 24:33)
normally four we had five under table (24:30 - 24:36)
the the whole thing was wild so thanks (24:33 - 24:38)
to everybody who had me build a deck who (24:36 - 24:40)
sent me things i didn't use anybody's (24:38 - 24:43)
decks as is because apparently (24:40 - 24:46)
it had to be standard like it had to be (24:43 - 24:50)
playable in standard so i had to pick (24:46 - 24:51)
certain life cards that have a d e and (24:50 - 24:54)
an f on them yeah standard vehicle yeah (24:51 - 24:55)
yeah it has to be people said when you (24:54 - 24:57)
expanded stuff yeah it was sending me (24:55 - 24:59)
all sorts of stuff (24:57 - 25:01)
so i i put together a deck (24:59 - 25:03)
and i brought it so i have my own deck (25:01 - 25:05)
so i signed up for this max raid battle (25:03 - 25:06)
thing because i'm like i kind of want to (25:05 - 25:07)
i ca (25:06 - 25:09)
hey it'd be a good thing for me to learn (25:07 - 25:11)
how to play the game because i have (25:09 - 25:13)
other people there who are supposed to (25:11 - 25:14)
help me (25:13 - 25:16)
teach how to play this game because i (25:14 - 25:18)
kind of remember but i don't play it (25:16 - 25:19)
that often (25:18 - 25:21)
so (25:19 - 25:22)
it is (25:21 - 25:24)
there were five of us there were (25:22 - 25:26)
uh (25:24 - 25:28)
myself my friend junie who used to be a (25:26 - 25:30)
former pokemon professor who doesn't run (25:28 - 25:32)
the tcg anymore (25:30 - 25:36)
this cute 20-something couple i'm and (25:32 - 25:38)
an eight-year-old (25:36 - 25:39)
and the eight-year-olds where things (25:38 - 25:42)
went off the rails a little bit because (25:39 - 25:43)
you could bring your own decks from home (25:42 - 25:45)
so three of us had decks the (25:43 - 25:47)
eight-year-old had their deck and (25:45 - 25:49)
presented it the judge and the judge (25:47 - 25:53)
pulled it out and looked at it and said (25:49 - 25:55)
i have to count all these cards (25:53 - 25:57)
so he counts all the cards and he says (25:55 - 25:59)
okay well you have 80 (25:57 - 26:01)
you can only have 60. (25:59 - 26:03)
okay so you can't use this deck (26:01 - 26:05)
but they have (26:03 - 26:08)
they have event decks so my friend junie (26:05 - 26:10)
got the blastoise deck and they gave the (26:08 - 26:13)
eight-year-old the lycan rock deck (26:10 - 26:15)
so what's interesting about max raid (26:13 - 26:18)
battles since (26:15 - 26:19)
where did this kid come from was like (26:18 - 26:22)
parents playing with you his parents (26:19 - 26:23)
they just dropped him off and they're (26:22 - 26:26)
like good he's got a babysitter for for (26:23 - 26:27)
an hour and a half you know pokemon (26:26 - 26:29)
where our parents do (26:27 - 26:31)
drop their kids for three hours while (26:29 - 26:32)
they do their own thing (26:31 - 26:34)
so (26:32 - 26:36)
he's next to juni who's a dad thankfully (26:34 - 26:38)
and the judge who is used to kids (26:36 - 26:40)
because i'm like i am not dealing with (26:38 - 26:42)
this this is already a nightmare (26:40 - 26:47)
scenario so for max raid battles is all (26:42 - 26:49)
five of us take our turn at the same (26:47 - 26:50)
time (26:49 - 26:53)
so we all set up and we all (26:50 - 26:56)
put things out and we all get prepared (26:53 - 26:58)
and what's interesting is normally in (26:56 - 27:02)
the game you can only play one supporter (26:58 - 27:02)
per turn per turn (27:03 - 27:07)
but how it works is since we had five (27:05 - 27:08)
people (27:07 - 27:12)
we could play up to five supporters (27:08 - 27:13)
didn't matter (27:12 - 27:16)
where they came from so i so if i had (27:13 - 27:18)
three good supporters (27:16 - 27:21)
i could play three supporters and you (27:18 - 27:24)
didn't have to play them on yourself you (27:21 - 27:26)
could play them on other people but as a (27:24 - 27:28)
group you were limited to fives yes but (27:26 - 27:29)
as a group of course you had to talk (27:28 - 27:32)
about what was advantageous which is (27:29 - 27:34)
great when you have four adults (27:32 - 27:35)
it falls apart when you have an (27:34 - 27:37)
eight-year-old who screams i have a (27:35 - 27:39)
supporter and slams it down and does the (27:37 - 27:41)
action on themselves and then (27:39 - 27:42)
everybody's like (27:41 - 27:44)
well that's one (27:42 - 27:46)
used what other four is i got another (27:44 - 27:48)
one slime like (27:46 - 27:50)
love kids oh boy (27:48 - 27:54)
you love them oh boy so (27:50 - 27:55)
thankfully the judge was really helping (27:54 - 27:57)
the kid because the kid also got a duck (27:55 - 27:58)
that he'd never seen before and he's (27:57 - 28:00)
like okay well you need to bring this up (27:58 - 28:02)
and you need to do this (28:00 - 28:04)
so that was handled (28:02 - 28:06)
so what happens is he brought out three (28:04 - 28:08)
cards he's like okay you get to pick (28:06 - 28:10)
randomly pick who you're judge is being (28:08 - 28:12)
the like pikachu right or the judge is (28:10 - 28:14)
being the boss what are we what are we (28:12 - 28:16)
fighting are we fighting a piece he says (28:14 - 28:18)
okay we'll randomly pick i don't know (28:16 - 28:20)
what the other two show i randomly (28:18 - 28:21)
picked for the group and so we were (28:20 - 28:22)
fighting (28:21 - 28:24)
espeon gx (28:22 - 28:24)
okay (28:24 - 28:27)
and what's interesting about the (28:24 - 28:30)
way the game works is (28:27 - 28:34)
the boss doesn't have any health (28:30 - 28:34)
the only way you win (28:34 - 28:38)
is by milling out the boss's deck so (28:36 - 28:41)
that on their turn they can't pull (28:38 - 28:43)
another card (28:41 - 28:47)
and so the boss has a deck of 40 cards (28:43 - 28:51)
and all energy gets attached immediately (28:47 - 28:53)
and the boss has no hand size pulse (28:51 - 28:56)
plays pulls plays pulls plays and the (28:53 - 28:59)
only way to mill cards is for every 30 (28:56 - 29:02)
damage you manage to get stuck on the (28:59 - 29:04)
boss (29:02 - 29:04)
a card gets (29:04 - 29:09)
exiled or put into the lost zone for (29:06 - 29:12)
each 30 points of damage that's done (29:09 - 29:15)
the problem with this format is once all (29:12 - 29:19)
the energy of his deck was attached (29:15 - 29:22)
it was just supporter chains (29:19 - 29:25)
and so you just set one of his turn took (29:22 - 29:27)
half an hour as he went through the (29:25 - 29:30)
chain of supporter actions (29:27 - 29:32)
as he played them out he's like okay i (29:30 - 29:34)
have to draw seven cards okay so now i (29:32 - 29:36)
have seven cards i have to play this (29:34 - 29:38)
down okay this makes me draw three cards (29:36 - 29:40)
i draw three more cards okay so now i (29:38 - 29:41)
have to play these because he's not (29:40 - 29:43)
allowed to have a hand and so literally (29:41 - 29:45)
at one point a bunch of us left we're (29:43 - 29:48)
like well this is taking half an hour so (29:45 - 29:49)
we're gonna go use the restroom we're (29:48 - 29:51)
gonna get something to eat and come back (29:49 - 29:55)
and maybe his turn will be done (29:51 - 29:55)
of the boss took forever (29:56 - 30:01)
so anyways first turn i picked you know (29:58 - 30:03)
we did we did the whole thing have i (30:01 - 30:06)
have rosalia out everybody has a thing (30:03 - 30:09)
i have rowlet in the back (30:06 - 30:12)
so does the damage would cause confusion (30:09 - 30:13)
but i have aroma (30:12 - 30:16)
uh the aroma grass card that stops (30:13 - 30:17)
special conditions so i'm the only (30:16 - 30:20)
person that's not confused at the table (30:17 - 30:23)
uh and then i have a rare candy because (30:20 - 30:25)
i don't have any dart tricks in my deck (30:23 - 30:28)
so i evolved my rowlet to (30:25 - 30:30)
the newest decidueye (30:28 - 30:32)
and the ability on decidueye is deep (30:30 - 30:35)
forest camo which prevents all damage (30:32 - 30:36)
done (30:35 - 30:40)
by v and gx pokemon and so i put it down (30:36 - 30:43)
and i looked at the judge and i said (30:40 - 30:45)
am i reading this correctly and he's (30:43 - 30:48)
like oh yep i can't hurt you (30:45 - 30:51)
and the only way we can lose is when (30:48 - 30:53)
your pokemon gets knocked out you pick (30:51 - 30:56)
one of your prizes and if everybody at (30:53 - 30:58)
the table picks up all of their prizes (30:56 - 31:01)
so if everybody goes through six pokemon (30:58 - 31:02)
we all lose (31:01 - 31:05)
but at that point as like well i (31:02 - 31:09)
i can't ever get knocked out you can't (31:05 - 31:11)
hurt me (31:09 - 31:14)
all of your attacks because it's from (31:11 - 31:15)
gx (31:14 - 31:18)
do nothing there's one attack that says (31:15 - 31:19)
place up (31:18 - 31:22)
10 10 damage counters you had to put a (31:19 - 31:24)
hundred damage on (31:22 - 31:26)
one of your pokemon you got to pick so i (31:24 - 31:28)
just loaded my (31:26 - 31:30)
bench up with things with high health (31:28 - 31:32)
and when that randomly came up i would (31:30 - 31:34)
just move them and i just sat there (31:32 - 31:36)
doing 90 damage (31:34 - 31:37)
i just had a handful of cards and he'd (31:36 - 31:38)
look at me he's like okay so what are (31:37 - 31:40)
you doing i'm like well you know what (31:38 - 31:42)
i'm doing i've been doing it for the (31:40 - 31:43)
last two hours (31:42 - 31:45)
i'm doing (31:43 - 31:46)
how long did 90 (31:45 - 31:48)
game take it took two and a half hours (31:46 - 31:51)
that is called not fun (31:48 - 31:52)
so (31:51 - 31:55)
did you have fun i had a great time (31:52 - 31:58)
um once the snowball started (31:55 - 32:01)
because once you finally force it to (31:58 - 32:03)
discard the healing items out of its (32:01 - 32:04)
deck (32:03 - 32:06)
then the turns just flew because it was (32:04 - 32:08)
like i'm pulling cards but nothing's (32:06 - 32:09)
helping (32:08 - 32:12)
so once we got past the snowball part (32:09 - 32:14)
it was super fun and it was also super (32:12 - 32:16)
fun to (32:14 - 32:19)
if you have a good group like four of us (32:16 - 32:20)
were talking and talking about which (32:19 - 32:23)
supporters would use on each other which (32:20 - 32:25)
pokemon we're needing what can we what (32:23 - 32:27)
can we do to help because (32:25 - 32:30)
there's no bench pokemon for the boss (32:27 - 32:32)
so boss's orders (32:30 - 32:34)
is on another player so we everybody was (32:32 - 32:36)
that confused at the table so i'm like (32:34 - 32:38)
well i will use boss's orders on you (32:36 - 32:41)
force yours back to the bench (32:38 - 32:43)
it will stop being confused then you can (32:41 - 32:45)
move it up (32:43 - 32:47)
or we can do this so it was really (32:45 - 32:49)
interesting fun (32:47 - 32:52)
strategy that way but i was like (32:49 - 32:53)
thanks to everybody help me build this (32:52 - 32:56)
deck because i was absolutely just i was (32:53 - 32:58)
always doing 90. i'm like i can get rid (32:56 - 33:01)
of three cards every turn on my turn (32:58 - 33:03)
because it can't hurt me back i'm just (33:01 - 33:05)
sitting here (33:03 - 33:07)
doing stuff and then i got i i went with (33:05 - 33:11)
sisuyan liligan so i had the v star (33:07 - 33:14)
ability so i could search my deck for (33:11 - 33:15)
energy (33:14 - 33:17)
so i just set myself up and i'm like (33:15 - 33:20)
we're going to win the the biggest (33:17 - 33:22)
problem was trying to convince the kid (33:20 - 33:24)
so at the last turn we're like if we all (33:22 - 33:27)
pass (33:24 - 33:27)
we win (33:27 - 33:30)
there's one card he has to take five (33:28 - 33:32)
turns there's one card so he draws once (33:30 - 33:35)
and then cannot draw anymore we win so (33:32 - 33:37)
we're all like (33:35 - 33:38)
we're we're passing and the eight year (33:37 - 33:42)
goals never pass i'm playing on and (33:38 - 33:44)
we're like (33:42 - 33:45)
no (33:44 - 33:46)
no you're not (33:45 - 33:48)
we're no (33:46 - 33:50)
we're not no (33:48 - 33:54)
we said if you do nothing we win the (33:50 - 33:55)
game (33:54 - 33:57)
and then he looked at his mom and his (33:55 - 33:58)
mom's like (33:57 - 34:02)
he's like okay and then we (33:58 - 34:02)
but if you can like if you have a deck (34:02 - 34:07)
so the what the judge said is the format (34:04 - 34:10)
is set up for (34:07 - 34:12)
tournaments where people are bringing (34:10 - 34:14)
competitive decks (34:12 - 34:16)
so it goes really fast (34:14 - 34:18)
they're trying to balance it for places (34:16 - 34:20)
like gen con where they give (34:18 - 34:23)
pre-constructed decks that aren't (34:20 - 34:26)
optimized in any way right so for us it (34:23 - 34:28)
took a really long time because most of (34:26 - 34:30)
us didn't have (34:28 - 34:32)
optimized decks that could have great (34:30 - 34:33)
supporters and they're moving things (34:32 - 34:36)
around and they're changing the stadiums (34:33 - 34:37)
around and doing all these things or (34:36 - 34:39)
blocking things from happening (34:37 - 34:42)
uh so it did take a while i mean i i had (34:39 - 34:44)
a great time (34:42 - 34:45)
they are they do it on all these things (34:44 - 34:48)
so like if you want a different format (34:45 - 34:49)
and a (34:48 - 34:51)
a competitive (34:49 - 34:54)
sort of way of playing definitely do it (34:51 - 34:56)
i had a great time thanks to everybody (34:54 - 34:58)
who helped me build this deck i was the (34:56 - 35:00)
mvp at the table because nothing could (34:58 - 35:01)
touch (35:00 - 35:05)
me uh i feel like your story gave me two (35:01 - 35:06)
feelings one is the (35:05 - 35:09)
the the main reason i stopped running a (35:06 - 35:12)
pokemon league not because kids are (35:09 - 35:15)
bad it's because parents are bad right i (35:12 - 35:19)
am not here to babysit your child (35:15 - 35:22)
yep i am i am here to make sure games (35:19 - 35:24)
are going smoothly and people have their (35:22 - 35:26)
questions answered and there is a safe (35:24 - 35:28)
space for people to come and play (35:26 - 35:32)
pokemon this is not a day of care um (35:28 - 35:34)
so that was the first level of anxiety (35:32 - 35:36)
i've had when you told your story the (35:34 - 35:39)
second is just playing with a stranger (35:36 - 35:41)
and not necessarily like a kid but i (35:39 - 35:45)
feel like if you knew all five people in (35:41 - 35:46)
your group (35:45 - 35:47)
that experience probably would have been (35:46 - 35:49)
significantly better versus oh yeah i (35:47 - 35:52)
have no clue who these two people are (35:49 - 35:54)
and they're kind of ruining the mood (35:52 - 35:56)
yeah i mean we were lucky they the other (35:54 - 35:59)
two were great the kid i mean we knew (35:56 - 36:00)
were in trouble like you see my head's (35:59 - 36:03)
phones here he showed up to the table (36:00 - 36:06)
wearing these and he never took them off (36:03 - 36:08)
so already in a loud space trying to (36:06 - 36:10)
communicate to the child (36:08 - 36:13)
was tough because half the time he's he (36:10 - 36:15)
was just like in his own world which was (36:13 - 36:16)
fine (36:15 - 36:18)
um i i i think (36:16 - 36:22)
it's a super fun format um (36:18 - 36:23)
great if you (36:22 - 36:25)
like if you know all four people it (36:23 - 36:27)
would be (36:25 - 36:29)
a blast if you had competitive decks it (36:27 - 36:31)
would take way less time than it took (36:29 - 36:32)
hours (36:31 - 36:34)
um but even then we all had a great time (36:32 - 36:35)
you know because we're all talking (36:34 - 36:37)
together we're all seeing what our decks (36:35 - 36:39)
can do we're all seeing what pokemon we (36:37 - 36:42)
bring out we're all talking about what's (36:39 - 36:44)
like i have this supporter (36:42 - 36:46)
what's the best use for the supporter it (36:44 - 36:49)
was super fun in that way and since i (36:46 - 36:52)
don't play the tcg hardly at all i was (36:49 - 36:53)
like i'm actually having a really good (36:52 - 36:55)
like i can really do nothing but help (36:53 - 36:56)
everybody out because i can't get (36:55 - 36:59)
knocked out so i'm just here to support (36:56 - 37:02)
everybody else was like my ideal role in (36:59 - 37:04)
most sort of (37:02 - 37:06)
play games where we're all working (37:04 - 37:07)
together like i'll be here to support (37:06 - 37:09)
everybody (37:07 - 37:11)
um but i had a great time thanks to (37:09 - 37:14)
everybody again for the deck suggestions (37:11 - 37:15)
i built a fun deck (37:14 - 37:17)
i had a good time there i would (37:15 - 37:20)
definitely do it again it cost six (37:17 - 37:21)
dollars but i got three tickets so i got (37:20 - 37:24)
a hat i got six dollars worth a hat (37:21 - 37:25)
back (37:24 - 37:27)
um (37:25 - 37:29)
super fun like and (37:27 - 37:30)
like i would even say if you're going to (37:29 - 37:32)
worlds and you're looking for something (37:30 - 37:34)
just like i want to (37:32 - 37:36)
sort of play this game but i don't want (37:34 - 37:38)
that i don't know how to build or craft (37:36 - 37:40)
a deck for like a draft (37:38 - 37:43)
look into max raid battles because it is (37:40 - 37:43)
a very (37:43 - 37:46)
it's a very helpful (37:43 - 37:50)
team-based event that takes a lot of the (37:46 - 37:52)
stress out of it you're just there to (37:50 - 37:53)
have (37:52 - 37:55)
a good time fighting against the judge (37:53 - 37:58)
and whatever like i know the other one (37:55 - 38:00)
one of the other ones is mewtwo we saw (37:58 - 38:02)
that one i don't know what the third was (38:00 - 38:06)
probably a pikachu probably pikachu (38:02 - 38:08)
cool all right well we got some more (38:06 - 38:10)
pokemon news we'll take a quick break (38:08 - 38:12)
and when we come back we will get that (38:10 - 38:15)
covered (38:12 - 38:15)
and we are back from our break (38:15 - 38:23)
there was a new wild area event (38:20 - 38:24)
i don't (38:23 - 38:27)
know if it's because sword and shield is (38:24 - 38:29)
almost three years old or if they've (38:27 - 38:32)
they were like three days is not enough (38:29 - 38:34)
so let's make these events (38:32 - 38:36)
like 10 days now (38:34 - 38:38)
but this is the second time (38:36 - 38:40)
because the mayoral event was what 10 (38:38 - 38:42)
days (38:40 - 38:44)
but yeah i think they understand like oh (38:42 - 38:46)
it's people aren't necessarily paying (38:44 - 38:48)
attention so we need to get the word out (38:46 - 38:50)
and let people figure it out and then (38:48 - 38:51)
get on (38:50 - 38:53)
yeah so so there's a grim snarl event (38:51 - 38:54)
happening right now in pokemon sword and (38:53 - 38:57)
pokemon shield um rimstar was a very (38:54 - 38:59)
very good competitive pokemon (38:57 - 39:01)
uh and (38:59 - 39:02)
so i i (39:01 - 39:04)
i would assume the reason that grim star (39:02 - 39:06)
was picked you having merrell's pick (39:04 - 39:07)
because it was like water week or (39:06 - 39:08)
whatever yeah um (39:07 - 39:12)
is because it does overlap into the (39:08 - 39:14)
uh world championships so i think that (39:12 - 39:16)
that wasn't like (39:14 - 39:18)
a coincidence that it was grim snarl (39:16 - 39:20)
grimstar easily (39:18 - 39:22)
top 10 competitive pokemon throughout (39:20 - 39:23)
sword and shield (39:22 - 39:27)
uh it started on thursday it will run (39:23 - 39:31)
until hold on where's the date here (39:27 - 39:32)
august 21st (39:31 - 39:36)
so that that is the last day of worlds (39:32 - 39:39)
and yeah i i did expect them to run a (39:36 - 39:41)
max raid event during worlds because of (39:39 - 39:43)
course why why would they not they they (39:41 - 39:45)
love to put everything on the same exact (39:43 - 39:47)
weekend uh but them starting this really (39:45 - 39:48)
then them starting this a little bit (39:47 - 39:51)
early and doing that 10 days (39:48 - 39:53)
it is great i i wish we could be saying (39:51 - 39:57)
that like two years ago i wish we (39:53 - 39:59)
no we can't (39:57 - 40:01)
but uh yeah grim starls and raids (39:59 - 40:02)
there's a two percent chance for a shiny (40:01 - 40:05)
one um it is a hundred two percent shiny (40:02 - 40:07)
chance in five star rates i did make a a (40:05 - 40:10)
helpful infographic on instagram and (40:07 - 40:12)
twitter and all that stuff to check that (40:10 - 40:13)
out (40:12 - 40:14)
not (40:13 - 40:17)
the best odds because normally (40:14 - 40:19)
in a five star raids sometimes there's (40:17 - 40:21)
other pokemon so you can just ignore all (40:19 - 40:23)
those other pokemon in this case since (40:21 - 40:24)
all the five star promoted are grim (40:23 - 40:27)
snarl you have to check all of them to (40:24 - 40:29)
see if they're shiny or not um (40:27 - 40:31)
but still it was it was it was fun to go (40:29 - 40:32)
back (40:31 - 40:33)
because i missed the last couple raid (40:32 - 40:36)
events either because of travel (40:33 - 40:37)
short time (40:36 - 40:38)
already had that pokemon (40:37 - 40:40)
it was fun to go back this past weekend (40:38 - 40:43)
and just do some raids with people (40:40 - 40:46)
um and yeah i i ended up getting a shiny (40:43 - 40:49)
on the first you know hour of checking (40:46 - 40:51)
dens and (40:49 - 40:55)

this is too forward for you you're like (42:45 - 42:50)
well i like no but it's more standard (42:48 - 42:52)
the concept to me tha of like (42:50 - 42:56)
if my stuffed creature has a permanent (42:52 - 42:59)
facial expression it's like for all (42:56 - 43:00)
eternity you (42:59 - 43:03)
can only see out of one eye (43:00 - 43:06)

maybe maybe it only can see out of one (43:06 - 43:10)
eye it has to close i mean (43:08 - 43:13)
that's okay but if i have the ability to (43:10 - 43:16)
choose which one to bring to life (43:13 - 43:19)
i'm gonna bring the one that's looking (43:16 - 43:21)
staring at me with two (43:19 - 43:23)
cold dead empty eyes i'm sure that makes (43:21 - 43:25)

a reverse knit pikachu sweater okay i'll (46:20 - 46:26)
make you one of those let me stop here i (46:24 - 46:28)
will say the pikachu sweater was (46:26 - 46:29)
probably one of the better things they (46:28 - 46:31)
offered not because it was reversible i (46:29 - 46:33)
think it's a really bad reversible (46:31 - 46:35)
sweater i think it's (46:33 - 46:37)
it's bad (46:35 - 46:39)
uh but that pikachu sweater was also (46:37 - 46:40)
like 160 (46:39 - 46:45)
a pikachu hoodie a flying b pokemon t uh (46:40 - 46:48)
mewtwo bbc arch logo a star field (46:45 - 46:53)
pikachu tote bag and a pokemon rug (46:48 - 46:53)
there wasn't it wasn't i mean when they (46:55 - 46:58)
say capsule (46:57 - 47:00)
it's like a small set it was pretty (46:58 - 47:02)
small (47:00 - 47:04)
um it's seven items (47:02 - 47:07)
no i'm sorry the the the hoodie with the (47:04 - 47:10)
standard pikachu fighting png that they (47:07 - 47:12)
used which to be fair they have to get (47:10 - 47:14)
approval from the pokemon company for (47:12 - 47:16)
designs and stuff uh was 160 (47:14 - 47:18)
the reversible (47:16 - 47:19)
hoodie (47:18 - 47:21)
sweater not hoodie no hood (47:19 - 47:24)
the reversible sweater was 275 (47:21 - 47:27)
dollars (47:24 - 47:27)
i'll make you one don't worry about it (47:27 - 47:30)
and it (47:29 - 47:32)
it it looks good until you reverse it (47:30 - 47:35)
then it looks bad (47:32 - 47:35)
then it looks bad what it looks like it (47:36 - 47:43)
it looks terrible it didn't look good to (47:40 - 47:44)
begin with (47:43 - 47:45)
no (47:44 - 47:48)
they both look fine (47:45 - 47:50)
no because (47:48 - 47:52)
it's just a giant pikachu head and then (47:50 - 47:54)
some japanese text on an all-black (47:52 - 47:56)
sweater and then when you reverse it you (47:54 - 47:58)
just get this weird (47:56 - 48:01)
yellowish cover color on the body but (47:58 - 48:03)
then you still get (48:01 - 48:05)
a black neckline black sleeves and then (48:03 - 48:08)
you see the obvious seams that (48:05 - 48:10)
connect the sleeves to the body and that (48:08 - 48:13)
in itself makes it look bad it's called (48:10 - 48:15)
fashion when i knit it for you there (48:13 - 48:17)
will be no seams because i know how to (48:15 - 48:22)
knit without seams (48:17 - 48:22)
so mine will cost you 500. i think the (48:23 - 48:30)
pikachu on the tote bag looked good the (48:26 - 48:35)
the best product is the tote bag yes and (48:30 - 48:37)
yeah (48:35 - 48:38)
although i'm still under like the (48:37 - 48:40)
mindset that t-shirts are like twenty (48:38 - 48:42)
dollars but in reality in the last like (48:40 - 48:44)
five years t-shirts have crept up to (48:42 - 48:46)
like 25 (48:44 - 48:48)
and then like designer shirts are like (48:46 - 48:50)
they've crept up to 30. you think (48:48 - 48:53)
they're 30 now oh they are 30 now we (48:50 - 48:54)
were just at hot topic we should have (48:53 - 48:56)
checked t-shirt prices (48:54 - 48:57)
well but they didn't have any t-shirts (48:56 - 48:59)
we wanted that's true they had like no (48:57 - 49:02)
pokemon stuff at hot topic not no longer (48:59 - 49:05)
hot no longer a topic but we did go over (49:02 - 49:08)
to box lunch and almost bought a slow (49:05 - 49:10)
cooker (49:08 - 49:14)
i did have the pokemon slow cooker yeah (49:10 - 49:17)
why it was pure fire a pokemon rice (49:14 - 49:19)
maker if there was a pokemon rice maker (49:17 - 49:22)
i would have snuck it up so fast (49:19 - 49:24)
in a heartbeat (49:22 - 49:26)
take it take it home it could look like (49:24 - 49:28)
any of the pokemon (49:26 - 49:30)
let me put rice in your mouth and get (49:28 - 49:33)
hot rice out (49:30 - 49:33)
uh i want to say (49:34 - 49:38)
very it's very often i come on this (49:36 - 49:39)
program (49:38 - 49:41)
and say that i'm wrong (49:39 - 49:44)
because i'm i'm i'm almost never wrong (49:41 - 49:46)
oh (49:44 - 49:47)
ho (49:46 - 49:48)
boy (49:47 - 49:50)
ah but i want to come on this show and (49:48 - 49:52)
say i was wrong about emblems (49:50 - 49:54)
in pokemon unite (49:52 - 49:58)
they're pretty good (49:54 - 49:58)
ruining the game i did not (50:06 - 50:12)
i remember this i said (50:09 - 50:14)
they are though like paid to win in a (50:12 - 50:15)
sense of (50:14 - 50:18)
you can buy like you're only (50:15 - 50:20)
you can put so much time in unite and (50:18 - 50:23)
get like five and then if you do the (50:20 - 50:25)
like purple thing which is two bucks or (50:23 - 50:27)
four bucks or however much gems or (50:25 - 50:29)
whatever it's 200 gems which is like i (50:27 - 50:30)
actually think it's like closer to four (50:29 - 50:33)
dollars you can earn those emblems (50:30 - 50:35)
faster (50:33 - 50:37)
yeah it's still random the which ones (50:35 - 50:40)
you get like yeah it's it's it's harder (50:37 - 50:42)
to say that it's pay to win (50:40 - 50:43)
through that than it was through the (50:42 - 50:45)
items that you could literally pay money (50:43 - 50:47)
do and yes i (50:45 - 50:48)
i will (50:47 - 50:50)
i will say that it's like (50:48 - 50:52)
i i always have always agreed that like (50:50 - 50:55)
unites not really paid to win (50:52 - 50:57)
compared to something like a clash (50:55 - 50:58)
royale (50:57 - 51:01)
oh yeah yeah because like (50:58 - 51:02)
you could (51:01 - 51:05)
pay as much money as you want you unite (51:02 - 51:06)
for (51:05 - 51:09)
um held items and for emblems (51:06 - 51:12)
but if one of your (51:09 - 51:14)
players (51:12 - 51:16)
decides to sit in the base the entire 10 (51:14 - 51:19)
minutes (51:16 - 51:20)
it doesn't matter how much money you've (51:19 - 51:24)
spent correct you're going to lose one (51:20 - 51:27)
person can shank that game real good um (51:24 - 51:30)
and yeah you can like report them (51:27 - 51:31)
so like (51:30 - 51:34)
did i feel like a more (51:31 - 51:39)
powerful player by putting on emblems (51:34 - 51:40)
yes (51:39 - 51:43)
but that still (51:40 - 51:44)
doesn't (51:43 - 51:46)
change the overall teamwork needed in (51:44 - 51:49)
unite which i think is like that fine (51:46 - 51:51)
line of like paid to win or not paid to (51:49 - 51:52)
win because like (51:51 - 51:55)
i could get more emblems but i still if (51:52 - 51:57)
i still think back of situations that (51:55 - 51:59)
like oh i lost that i don't think (51:57 - 52:01)
winning that would have changed the (51:59 - 52:02)
outcome of the match because it was more (52:01 - 52:04)
of team positioning (52:02 - 52:08)
and goals than it was like (52:04 - 52:10)
oh if i if i was like slightly stronger (52:08 - 52:12)
we wouldn't have lost it's like no we i (52:10 - 52:14)
would have won that little interaction (52:12 - 52:15)
but i don't think that would have like (52:14 - 52:16)
changed the tide of the outcome of the (52:15 - 52:19)
match i i i think emblems overall are (52:16 - 52:22)
good for the game (52:19 - 52:23)
i think it gives i think they give a (52:22 - 52:26)
level of control to your play style i (52:23 - 52:28)
think it gives you (52:26 - 52:31)
custom ability some some customizing (52:28 - 52:33)
options i think they're kind of fun (52:31 - 52:35)
they're releasing a new slate apparently (52:33 - 52:37)
like more are coming so (52:35 - 52:42)
um like i expect them to expand out (52:37 - 52:46)
the emblems and i think (52:42 - 52:46)
it is good for people who play the game (52:46 - 52:51)
a lot it is an interesting (52:49 - 52:54)
aspect that as a new player like (52:51 - 52:57)
teamwork and knowing like (52:54 - 52:58)
okay do you want to hear the thing that (52:57 - 53:01)
made me so mad last night (52:58 - 53:02)
yes we played together (53:01 - 53:05)
this is after this is me okay this is (53:02 - 53:07)
this is one in the morning (53:05 - 53:10)
there is a player (53:07 - 53:12)
who is playing with champ (53:10 - 53:14)
whose name (53:12 - 53:18)
username was rotate to dread (53:14 - 53:18)
guess what they didn't do (53:19 - 53:22)
take a guess to what they did not do (53:22 - 53:30)
that entire game (53:26 - 53:30)
before you answer before you tell me (53:30 - 53:34)
what they did or did not do (53:32 - 53:36)
i played with them a champ (53:34 - 53:38)
season one and their name i played with (53:36 - 53:40)
them multiple times they were just a (53:38 - 53:42)
random person that would get queued up (53:40 - 53:44)
they were machamp player their name was (53:42 - 53:46)
i stole zapdos (53:44 - 53:49)
and i would say every time i played the (53:46 - 53:50)
game (53:49 - 53:53)
they did exactly what their name stated (53:50 - 53:55)
see see this is what i needed from (53:53 - 53:57)
rotate to dread (53:55 - 53:59)
i (53:57 - 54:03)
i had to walk away i was so mad (53:59 - 54:05)
i like at finally one person i could (54:03 - 54:07)
count on (54:05 - 54:09)
to rotate to dread (54:07 - 54:12)
not once (54:09 - 54:12)
i (54:12 - 54:16)
look i i have not played league of (54:14 - 54:17)
legends (54:16 - 54:19)
uh i have not played dota 2 i have not (54:17 - 54:22)
played heroes of the storm i have not (54:19 - 54:23)
played smite i'm trying to think of the (54:22 - 54:25)
big mobas (54:23 - 54:27)
but when when greg and i played last (54:25 - 54:28)
night (54:27 - 54:31)
uh we were in a group of three meaning (54:28 - 54:33)
we would get paired with either two solo (54:31 - 54:35)
people or a duo (54:33 - 54:37)
and i think i think squads of two and (54:35 - 54:39)
three are the best for unite because if (54:37 - 54:41)
you squad with five you're gonna get (54:39 - 54:42)
paired against five and you can't squad (54:41 - 54:43)
with four (54:42 - 54:47)
yeah you can only do so weird (54:43 - 54:49)
probably for the best i don't know (54:47 - 54:50)
so (54:49 - 54:51)
what (54:50 - 54:56)
i have what i noticed is a lot of um (54:51 - 54:59)
duos will want to claim the top lane (54:56 - 55:02)
and when i duo (54:59 - 55:04)
mostly because i play cramer ant i they (55:02 - 55:05)
recommend cramer ant for the top but (55:04 - 55:08)
like i will want to take top because (55:05 - 55:11)
then i know that at least 50 percent of (55:08 - 55:14)
the top lane is going to rotate to dread (55:11 - 55:15)
so (55:14 - 55:16)
every (55:15 - 55:18)
i think greg and i played like five (55:16 - 55:19)
matches (55:18 - 55:23)
and of the four out of five matches (55:19 - 55:26)
we got duos that both claimed the top (55:23 - 55:27)
lane (55:26 - 55:29)
they're all different duos (55:27 - 55:33)
and none of them rotated to dread (55:29 - 55:36)
which is like (55:33 - 55:36)
for a game that's been out for a year (55:36 - 55:42)
and for like two people to be like i (55:40 - 55:44)
want this lane (55:42 - 55:47)
i just don't understand i don't get it (55:44 - 55:50)
the (55:47 - 55:52)
i i i i i i (55:50 - 55:54)
i get people who argue that road time is (55:52 - 55:56)
more important the thing that makes me (55:54 - 55:59)
frustrated about it is rotom can be (55:56 - 56:00)
stopped (55:59 - 56:03)
rotom is to distract the the other team (56:00 - 56:04)
to make them (56:03 - 56:06)
think they have to stop this from (56:04 - 56:08)
scoring because it only scores two and (56:06 - 56:10)
row time is only important if you have a (56:08 - 56:12)
bunch of people (56:10 - 56:14)
lined up behind it who can make big (56:12 - 56:17)
dunks but if you go rotate to dread you (56:14 - 56:20)
kill your team gets dread you get such a (56:17 - 56:23)
huge experience boost that it doesn't (56:20 - 56:26)
care if rotom scores because you can (56:23 - 56:28)
over level and overpower the other (56:26 - 56:31)
people who are coming behind the score (56:28 - 56:33)
like it makes no and i've heard so many (56:31 - 56:34)
people like oh well row time is more (56:33 - 56:36)
important because it does points it's (56:34 - 56:40)
like rotom is the distraction rotom is (56:36 - 56:43)
there to get you to do other things so (56:40 - 56:45)
that the other team is free to steal (56:43 - 56:46)
your jungle because you're trying to (56:45 - 56:49)
stop this thing from scoring (56:46 - 56:53)
it it can be stopped it is the is so (56:49 - 56:55)
unimportant in the layers of the game (56:53 - 56:58)
until end game because what you kind of (56:55 - 57:00)
want to do is be the last people to get (56:58 - 57:02)
rotum to send it down so they have to (57:00 - 57:05)
decide are we going to give an open (57:02 - 57:07)
thing or we're going to try to take zap (57:05 - 57:10)
and and 100 of the time it's take zap it (57:07 - 57:12)
just takes literally it (57:10 - 57:13)
because if you take zap it doesn't (57:12 - 57:16)
matter what those 20 points are right (57:13 - 57:17)
um (57:16 - 57:19)
but what i don't get is those people are (57:17 - 57:23)
so adamant about taking rotom that like (57:19 - 57:25)
that i don't i've won how many matches (57:23 - 57:28)
are you winning two like if you think (57:25 - 57:30)
about the the the situation (57:28 - 57:33)
somewhat logically which maybe no one is (57:30 - 57:34)
doing like (57:33 - 57:37)
if you think that you are the strongest (57:34 - 57:39)
player on your team if you think you are (57:37 - 57:41)
the best player in your team which which (57:39 - 57:44)
i i never think i am like i i support (57:41 - 57:45)
people (57:44 - 57:47)
yeah but but if if you are that person (57:45 - 57:48)
that thinks you are the better player on (57:47 - 57:51)
the team then wouldn't ideally you want (57:48 - 57:53)
to take dread because dread gives a (57:51 - 57:55)
boost to everyone so you can be like (57:53 - 57:58)
this picks up the slack yeah (57:55 - 58:00)
um (57:58 - 58:01)
and it's (58:00 - 58:04)
the same people who go to in my opinion (58:01 - 58:05)
from my experience i played a lot of (58:04 - 58:07)
matches (58:05 - 58:08)
maybe not as much as you know some (58:07 - 58:11)
hardcore united players but the the (58:08 - 58:13)
people who also focus on rotom i see (58:11 - 58:15)
they they never go to audino and if you (58:13 - 58:17)
were to ever watch my twitter stream (58:15 - 58:19)
i'll like i'll pan i'll be like these (58:17 - 58:20)
audios are still up these autonomous are (58:19 - 58:22)
still up these autonomous like as soon (58:20 - 58:24)
as autonomous like (58:22 - 58:25)
i don't think they also understand the (58:24 - 58:27)
mechanics of why audino spawns (58:25 - 58:30)
autonomous spawns as your comeback (58:27 - 58:32)
mechanic yeah they only spawn when you (58:30 - 58:35)
lose that base and it's okay to lose (58:32 - 58:37)
that top or bottom first base because (58:35 - 58:40)
audino gives you so much more experience (58:37 - 58:43)
yeah than the combis or the core fish (58:40 - 58:43)
like (58:43 - 58:46)
the odd like as soon as audino spawns (58:43 - 58:48)
you should be taking it given that (58:46 - 58:50)
there's not another objective and as (58:48 - 58:52)
soon as you take it they they will then (58:50 - 58:55)
spawn again it is literally the comeback (58:52 - 58:56)
mechanic (58:55 - 58:58)
to get you to level appropriately so (58:56 - 59:00)
like the whole (58:58 - 59:03)
like is there some value in rotum yeah (59:00 - 59:05)
sure but like again if you're a player (59:03 - 59:08)
that thinks like you're the best player (59:05 - 59:12)
giving everyone on your team experience (59:08 - 59:15)
let's let's you like ensure that your (59:12 - 59:17)
your plays matter because like ever then (59:15 - 59:19)
it's picking up everyone's slack i also (59:17 - 59:21)
don't understand like do the people that (59:19 - 59:23)
like strongly believe in rotom have they (59:21 - 59:25)
never just like (59:23 - 59:27)
looked at a youtube video or looked at a (59:25 - 59:29)
twitch stream or like look at any guide (59:27 - 59:32)
to like there's not a single top (59:29 - 59:35)
performer in unite that will argue that (59:32 - 59:38)
rotom is better there's not like we are (59:35 - 59:39)
going into the world championships this (59:38 - 59:42)
weekend there's not a single one of (59:39 - 59:44)
those people on stage that will tell you (59:42 - 59:47)
that rotom is better are you sure not a (59:44 - 59:50)
single one of them (59:47 - 59:52)
why (59:50 - 59:54)
the thing is the thing that (59:52 - 59:55)
i i (59:54 - 59:56)
like and people are like well i don't (59:55 - 59:58)
want to leave one person up there (59:56 - 59:59)
because they're gonna they're gonna (59:58 - 60:01)
score (59:59 - 60:04)
a little they can't take rotom by (60:01 - 60:06)
themselves before everybody else comes (60:04 - 60:08)
up (60:06 - 60:10)
yeah you can leave one person up there (60:08 - 60:11)
even if you left one person up there to (60:10 - 60:14)
like defend against two then it's four (60:11 - 60:16)
verse three at the bottom (60:14 - 60:18)
but like and like if all five of you go (60:16 - 60:21)
down and there's four on their team you (60:18 - 60:23)
have the advantage leave the one person (60:21 - 60:26)
up there it's fine (60:23 - 60:27)
it's just i don't (60:26 - 60:29)
i don't get it (60:27 - 60:32)
i don't (60:29 - 60:33)
with that being said emblems doesn't (60:32 - 60:35)
change (60:33 - 60:37)
hasn't changed any of it emblems is is a (60:35 - 60:40)
deep emblem i feel like emblems is the (60:37 - 60:42)
eevees of (60:40 - 60:43)
united yes (60:42 - 60:44)
like yes (60:43 - 60:46)
the other thing that i've noticed (60:44 - 60:48)
with emblems is no one understands how (60:46 - 60:49)
they work (60:48 - 60:52)
like unite itself did such a (60:49 - 60:55)
poor just not explain at all (60:52 - 60:58)
so the the quick explanation i can give (60:55 - 61:00)
is that you probably want to focus on (60:58 - 61:01)
two colors (61:00 - 61:03)
i mean if you're not sure what colors to (61:01 - 61:05)
focus on like the probably the best (61:03 - 61:07)
color that applies to everyone is black (61:05 - 61:08)
um (61:07 - 61:11)
the top really the top are black (61:08 - 61:12)
white (61:11 - 61:14)
green and red (61:12 - 61:17)
that's yeah so ideally ideally pick two (61:14 - 61:21)
colors and slot in emblems that will get (61:17 - 61:24)
you those two colors so for black it is (61:21 - 61:26)
three i think it's three five and seven (61:24 - 61:28)
three five so ideally you want seven (61:26 - 61:31)
emblems that give you black you want you (61:28 - 61:33)
want either three (61:31 - 61:35)
or five if you have four and you can't (61:33 - 61:38)
get it to five three is okay four does (61:35 - 61:41)
not give you three five seven the same (61:38 - 61:43)
for i think blue is two four six (61:41 - 61:46)
um so again two gives you a small boost (61:43 - 61:48)
four gives you a medium boost six gives (61:46 - 61:51)
you a large boost five gives you (61:48 - 61:53)
just the same boost that (61:51 - 61:56)
four does yeah right like you wanna (61:53 - 61:58)
like you wanna fill in those circles (61:56 - 62:01)
once you get the two or three colors you (61:58 - 62:03)
want or maybe just one color because you (62:01 - 62:05)
don't have enough emblems then you start (62:03 - 62:07)
tweaking those emblems (62:05 - 62:08)
for (62:07 - 62:11)
your attack your special attack your (62:08 - 62:14)
crit your hp so for example (62:11 - 62:15)
you could (62:14 - 62:17)
want a more (62:15 - 62:20)
hp focused build (62:17 - 62:22)
so you might switch out like oh zubat (62:20 - 62:26)
gives attack but golbat gives hp they're (62:22 - 62:29)
both black i'm going to switch out zubat (62:26 - 62:31)
for goldbat oh tentacruel gives special (62:29 - 62:36)
attack and his blacken and um (62:31 - 62:36)
blue (62:36 - 62:38)
but victory rebel gives (62:36 - 62:41)
uh physical attack and that's black and (62:38 - 62:43)
green i'm going to switch out victory (62:41 - 62:44)
bell for (62:43 - 62:47)
so once the heart attack greetings the (62:44 - 62:50)
colors are way more important yeah than (62:47 - 62:52)
the numbers you see right (62:50 - 62:55)
and that's that's the best i can give in (62:52 - 62:57)
an audio podcast of like worry about the (62:55 - 62:59)
colors first (62:57 - 63:01)
and then worry about the (62:59 - 63:04)
the number stuff get your color blocks (63:01 - 63:07)
done and then fine tune from there (63:04 - 63:09)
and it's okay that you the the the (63:07 - 63:11)
numbers might not seem super great off (63:09 - 63:14)
the bat those colors have so much weight (63:11 - 63:15)
compared to the numbers you're looking (63:14 - 63:17)
at just worry about the color worry (63:15 - 63:18)
about streaming (63:17 - 63:21)
and also like pay attention to (63:18 - 63:24)
if you're a special attacker if you're (63:21 - 63:27)
a melee attacker like those things (63:24 - 63:28)
matter (63:27 - 63:31)
in your decision making but not as much (63:28 - 63:32)
as (63:31 - 63:35)
what big block of color am i going to (63:32 - 63:37)
use (63:35 - 63:39)
i do think the benefit the on the not (63:37 - 63:41)
talked about benefit of emblems is (63:39 - 63:42)
because (63:41 - 63:44)
you can customize your play style a (63:42 - 63:46)
little bit more (63:44 - 63:47)
with them (63:46 - 63:50)
um it lets you change (63:47 - 63:52)
the held items (63:50 - 63:53)
more (63:52 - 63:55)
so for example (63:53 - 63:57)
i i cannot stand lucario players (63:55 - 63:59)
but a lot of lucario players (63:57 - 64:01)
run attack weight (63:59 - 64:03)
and so they probably want to heavily (64:01 - 64:05)
invest in speed (64:03 - 64:07)
so they can get to where they want to (64:05 - 64:09)
dunk (64:07 - 64:10)
but there could be lucario players that (64:09 - 64:13)
don't care about attack weight (64:10 - 64:15)
and so they might just invest in like (64:13 - 64:18)
attack instead (64:15 - 64:19)
um (64:18 - 64:22)
and so it took i played shell bell a lot (64:19 - 64:24)
with kramer (64:22 - 64:27)
all season one and then chelbel kind of (64:24 - 64:29)
got nerfed and then people started (64:27 - 64:31)
moving to focus band kramer ant and now (64:29 - 64:33)
with the (64:31 - 64:35)
changes with emblems i could run shell (64:33 - 64:37)
bell again even though it was nerfed but (64:35 - 64:38)
it feels (64:37 - 64:41)
good again to use i'm contemplating (64:38 - 64:44)
getting rid of (64:41 - 64:46)
experienced chair to bring back shel (64:44 - 64:48)
bell for my elder glass (64:46 - 64:50)
i i'm thinking about it (64:48 - 64:51)
um (64:50 - 64:53)
because the thing is like (64:51 - 64:55)
we are still trying to figure out what (64:53 - 64:59)
movement speed actually does (64:55 - 65:01)
and when it kicks in and when it kills (64:59 - 65:03)
because movement speed doesn't apply (65:01 - 65:06)
when you're in combat (65:03 - 65:08)
so (65:06 - 65:09)
it's a little (65:08 - 65:11)
question it's like okay so when does (65:09 - 65:13)
movement speed really kick in how long (65:11 - 65:14)
does it last (65:13 - 65:16)
what is the improvement really giving (65:14 - 65:20)
you uh because attack i used to use it a (65:16 - 65:21)
lot i mean i use experience chair quite (65:20 - 65:23)
a bit because it's also a big hp boost (65:21 - 65:26)
but i'm contemplating swapping it out to (65:23 - 65:29)
see how it feels because i don't feel (65:26 - 65:30)
that movement speed is really helping me (65:29 - 65:32)
anymore because i feel like i'm (65:30 - 65:34)
constantly now even as support having to (65:32 - 65:36)
be in combat (65:34 - 65:39)
um and that is (65:36 - 65:41)
not a movement speed doesn't do anything (65:39 - 65:43)
at that point (65:41 - 65:43)
yeah (65:44 - 65:46)
and the (65:44 - 65:48)
the the main complaint is like (65:46 - 65:50)
you have to play a lot to get emblems (65:48 - 65:52)
yep (65:50 - 65:54)
and if you're i i would i would maybe (65:52 - 65:56)
argue if you're not having a good time (65:54 - 65:57)
playing (65:56 - 65:59)
to unlock emblems i don't think emblems (65:57 - 66:01)
are going to dramatically change they're (65:59 - 66:03)
not they're going to be enough change (66:01 - 66:04)
they're not (66:03 - 66:07)
um i just it for me it was just a little (66:04 - 66:09)
bit frustrating because like i i have (66:07 - 66:11)
perfected my kramer rant build (66:09 - 66:15)
um but i i could change out one emblem (66:11 - 66:16)
for a different emblem i think it's (66:15 - 66:18)
slo-bro (66:16 - 66:21)
and there's it's it's just (66:18 - 66:22)
pulling (66:21 - 66:24)
the gotcha machine and being like this (66:22 - 66:26)
isn't slow bro this isn't celebrate this (66:24 - 66:28)
isn't slow bro and like (66:26 - 66:30)
it's frustrating because it's like i (66:28 - 66:32)
know how to make my build better and (66:30 - 66:35)
there's what 90 emblems and i'm not (66:32 - 66:38)
getting the one i need um (66:35 - 66:40)
uh there there's no way they're not (66:38 - 66:42)
introducing more in september right oh (66:40 - 66:43)
yeah no (66:42 - 66:44)
there's no way they're stopping at (66:43 - 66:47)
dugong (66:44 - 66:47)
what else can we do like there's going (66:49 - 66:54)
to be at least 151 by the end of the (66:51 - 66:56)
year (66:54 - 66:56)
man if only they made more pokemon after (66:57 - 67:02)
do gong we could maybe (66:59 - 67:05)
but they didn't oh well (67:02 - 67:06)
um (67:05 - 67:08)
we (67:06 - 67:10)
greg is here and you're probably like i (67:08 - 67:12)

uh why they always do steven right (68:50 - 68:54)
before something they do (68:52 - 68:56)
they love using steven as the bait (68:54 - 68:58)
story-wise what no the real bait the (68:56 - 69:00)
real bait is they're bringing back (68:58 - 69:03)

the looker battle is the hardest thing i (69:55 - 69:59)
have ever done in that game and i (69:58 - 70:02)
haven't even done part two it took weird (69:59 - 70:04)
hours (70:02 - 70:05)
to figure out a good way to do the (70:04 - 70:07)
looker battle looker has never had a (70:05 - 70:10)
pokemon in any of the games has he (70:07 - 70:12)
uh (70:10 - 70:14)
not that you battle now that you battle (70:12 - 70:17)
i think he's always had crow gunk (70:14 - 70:19)
yes pro gunk is his partner but i don't (70:17 - 70:20)
think i've ever seen him fight with it (70:19 - 70:24)
but yeah you fight in masters and (70:20 - 70:24)
uh you are in (70:25 - 70:31)
you are in for a world of hurt (70:26 - 70:31)
uh this was sent in by (70:34 - 70:40)
kevin slash buscoy and her slack kfc (70:37 - 70:42)
china is running a pokemon toy promotion (70:40 - 70:43)
for children's day (70:42 - 70:46)
where a meal comes with a pikachu or a (70:43 - 70:47)
psyduck toy (70:46 - 70:49)
uh the psyduck toy has gone viral on (70:47 - 70:51)
social media given its dancing (70:49 - 70:53)
capabilities and is listing for up to (70:51 - 70:56)
two hundred dollars at the moment (70:53 - 70:58)
that there's your did you watch the (70:56 - 71:00)
video of that yeah it is really cute i (70:58 - 71:03)
i'm like do i want do i hunt this dog (71:00 - 71:05)
because it is so cute but (71:03 - 71:06)
it is really cute (71:05 - 71:08)
yeah um (71:06 - 71:10)
to piggyback off that news i believe uh (71:08 - 71:11)
pokemon stuff is coming back to (71:10 - 71:13)
mcdonald's i think it's already in (71:11 - 71:15)
mcdonald's canada right now (71:13 - 71:17)
um (71:15 - 71:17)
you know pokemon stuff has always done (71:18 - 71:21)
really well at mcdonald's (71:20 - 71:23)
given (71:21 - 71:26)
any of the time frames it has appeared (71:23 - 71:28)
the last time it appeared (71:26 - 71:29)
um (71:28 - 71:32)
pokemon card and card scalpers were at (71:29 - 71:34)
an all-time high (71:32 - 71:36)
and that mcdonald's pikachu was going (71:34 - 71:39)
for about eighty dollars (71:36 - 71:43)
um resale value and that same ph is (71:39 - 71:45)
going for about 15 right now uh current (71:43 - 71:47)
day as of this podcast (71:45 - 71:50)
uh while i i do still think that it (71:47 - 71:52)
might be difficult in some areas to get (71:50 - 71:54)
these cards it should be night and day (71:52 - 71:56)
difference compared to (71:54 - 71:58)
the last time (71:56 - 72:00)
there was a mcdonald's promotion (71:58 - 72:02)
so (72:00 - 72:04)
there are still cards um (72:02 - 72:08)
and i believe there are toys (72:04 - 72:09)
but i did not see a listing of the toys (72:08 - 72:12)
i'm sure probably by (72:09 - 72:14)
next week or the week after we'll have (72:12 - 72:17)
more details on that (72:14 - 72:18)
um (72:17 - 72:19)
but yeah (72:18 - 72:23)
a mcdonald's mcdonald's pokemon stuff oh (72:19 - 72:26)
and then somebody on reddit (72:23 - 72:27)
they're (72:26 - 72:30)
out of all the stores to sell this early (72:27 - 72:33)
cole's department store had the (72:30 - 72:34)
the the (72:33 - 72:37)
booster packs (72:34 - 72:39)
they put them out on shelf early i don't (72:37 - 72:40)
think they're supposed to go on sale (72:39 - 72:43)
until september 1st but kohl's and maybe (72:40 - 72:45)
they had cole's cash you know (72:43 - 72:47)
kohl's plays by their own rules they (72:45 - 72:49)
have their own currency (72:47 - 72:52)
they have everything (72:49 - 72:52)
there's gonna be there's gonna be a (72:52 - 72:56)
society one day that's just all operated (72:54 - 72:59)
by coals and the only currency that they (72:56 - 73:02)
use is cole's cash cash (72:59 - 73:05)
my mom lives off cole's cash and i'm (73:02 - 73:07)
like i you know it's a scam right (73:05 - 73:09)
no it's not it's more valuable than the (73:07 - 73:11)
dollar what's the cold cash to the usd (73:09 - 73:13)
conversion rate right now i bet you the (73:11 - 73:15)
dollar is weaker (73:13 - 73:17)
i'm gonna buy flannel shirts i'm gonna (73:15 - 73:20)
buy flannel shirts at kohl's i might as (73:17 - 73:22)
well turn that kohl's cash right back (73:20 - 73:26)
around to buy more flannel shirts (73:22 - 73:26)
anyways (73:27 - 73:30)
they (73:28 - 73:33)
they had the booster packs uh that (73:30 - 73:35)
somebody got at kohl's early they put (73:33 - 73:36)
they opened up all the cards they posted (73:35 - 73:39)
on reddit it is it is a set (73:36 - 73:41)
um it is also like spooky pokemon it's (73:39 - 73:45)
like phantom pumpkaboo esper um hatarine (73:41 - 73:48)
grim snarl uh i don't think any of the (73:45 - 73:50)
cards in that set looked incredibly rare (73:48 - 73:53)
they just look like fun halloween cards (73:50 - 73:55)
so hopefully now that the set list is (73:53 - 73:56)
out there (73:55 - 73:59)
scalpers aren't going and buying a bunch (73:56 - 74:01)
of these with the thoughts that there's (73:59 - 74:02)
there's no charizard in the set this is (74:01 - 74:03)
what i'm saying i'm saying there is no (74:02 - 74:06)
charizard there is no reason that you (74:03 - 74:08)
would buy this set without your own (74:06 - 74:10)
personal enjoyment or the enjoyment of (74:08 - 74:12)
giving them to trick-or-treaters who (74:10 - 74:16)
come to your door i i am i i don't think (74:12 - 74:18)
you buying these with the expectation of (74:16 - 74:20)
maybe there's something secretly rare (74:18 - 74:22)
that you could resell (74:20 - 74:24)
uh we know that that's not the case (74:22 - 74:25)
anymore (74:24 - 74:27)
so (74:25 - 74:27)
they're just it's like 30 (74:28 - 74:33)
ghost slash (74:30 - 74:34)
the real crime is there's no zubat in (74:33 - 74:36)
the set that's the real crime you know (74:34 - 74:38)
zubat a very spooky very halloween (74:36 - 74:40)
pokemon (74:38 - 74:42)
that's that's the real (74:40 - 74:46)
the real devastation there so (74:42 - 74:48)
i think i'm gonna buy if i can find the (74:46 - 74:50)
the booster packs i'm gonna buy it (74:48 - 74:51)
probably just for myself just to keep a (74:50 - 74:53)
couple put them next to my engine right (74:51 - 74:54)
across the river right next to the (74:53 - 74:56)
walmart there's a lot of coals (74:54 - 74:58)
they will be at target too like that's (74:56 - 75:01)
not real and i might buy an extra set oh (74:58 - 75:03)
well i don't think they listed the price (75:01 - 75:05)
now that i'm thinking about it (75:03 - 75:06)
but (75:05 - 75:07)
i suppose (75:06 - 75:10)
cost 14.99 (75:07 - 75:10)
oh (75:10 - 75:14)
for 30 booster bags that is what uh (75:10 - 75:15)
yeah pokey beach is saying they're three (75:14 - 75:18)
car booster packs yeah yeah well i mean (75:15 - 75:20)
if you bought 30 booster packs at the (75:18 - 75:22)
dollar tree that's gonna be 30 bucks (75:20 - 75:24)
well there's 40 (75:22 - 75:25)
booster packs (75:24 - 75:29)
40 for 15 yes oh that's fun (75:25 - 75:32)
pays for itself at that point oh yeah (75:29 - 75:32)
um (75:33 - 75:35)

with like as dentists (77:19 - 77:23)
in the neighborhood so we got toothbrush (77:21 - 77:26)
and toothpaste every year and that sort (77:23 - 77:28)
of smug look when you went to the house (77:26 - 77:29)
and you're like well i'm not going to (77:28 - 77:31)
not go (77:29 - 77:33)
no i mean i i didn't mind that i thought (77:31 - 77:34)
that i think that's like a pretty good (77:33 - 77:36)
like (77:34 - 77:38)
i would rather take a brand new (77:36 - 77:40)
toothbrush than like (77:38 - 77:42)
candy corn (77:40 - 77:43)
i ain't going to eat the kids i don't (77:42 - 77:45)
know what arsenic he's laced in that (77:43 - 77:47)
toothpaste or on that toothbrush (77:45 - 77:49)
they're like there's razor blades and (77:47 - 77:52)
apples and there's arsenic on toothpaste (77:49 - 77:54)
none of it's to be trusted (77:52 - 77:57)
it's not a sealed package from (77:54 - 77:59)
i've gotten an apple before (77:57 - 78:00)
trick-or-treating (77:59 - 78:02)
i've gotten the i've gotten the whole (78:00 - 78:04)
like here's a whole apple in your bag (78:02 - 78:06)
i've gotten that before (78:04 - 78:08)
um my next-door neighbor used to make (78:06 - 78:11)
popcorn balls (78:08 - 78:11)
which i love (78:11 - 78:15)
i've got like pencils laced with cyanide (78:13 - 78:17)
obsolete cyanide have you gotten like (78:15 - 78:19)
pennies from like the old lady i've (78:17 - 78:20)
gotten that before no (78:19 - 78:22)
no (78:20 - 78:23)
well they used to make us do the unicef (78:22 - 78:25)
thing and i would always just never do (78:23 - 78:26)
it (78:25 - 78:28)
like i'm already asking you for food i'm (78:26 - 78:30)
not asking you for money on top of (78:28 - 78:32)
asking you for food (78:30 - 78:34)
this is already embarrassing enough none (78:32 - 78:36)
of us like this transaction the way it (78:34 - 78:38)
is (78:36 - 78:38)
i would say (78:40 - 78:43)
along the lines of my fundamental rule (78:41 - 78:45)
which i was trying to express before is (78:43 - 78:48)
don't give out candy at halloween that (78:45 - 78:50)
somebody wouldn't purchase at any other (78:48 - 78:52)
time of the year i did have one older (78:50 - 78:54)
couple in my neighborhood they gave out (78:52 - 78:56)
those were their originals which my (78:54 - 78:57)
parents loved it i would not touch with (78:56 - 78:59)
them (78:57 - 79:00)
um (78:59 - 79:03)
so like necco wafers necco wafers are a (79:00 - 79:05)
punishment disguised as a king yeah they (79:03 - 79:06)
are oh (79:05 - 79:08)
oh bad so you're saying you would rather (79:06 - 79:11)
take the toothbrush yes i would rather (79:08 - 79:13)
take the arsenic toothbrush than a neck (79:11 - 79:16)
away for any day okay (79:13 - 79:17)
and i will tell you (79:16 - 79:18)
the absolute worst thing that you can (79:17 - 79:21)
give out on halloween (79:18 - 79:24)
the mcdonald's coupon books (79:21 - 79:27)
oh that was enough front to naked (79:24 - 79:29)
is driving themselves (79:27 - 79:32)
oh man that always made me mad those (79:29 - 79:33)
coupons (79:32 - 79:36)
i would love this no that that (79:33 - 79:38)
infuriated me you would love it at your (79:36 - 79:41)
current age when you're seven and you (79:38 - 79:43)
can't get yourself to mcdonald's they're (79:41 - 79:45)
worthless they're worse okay what do you (79:43 - 79:47)
mean by coupon book are you like because (79:45 - 79:50)
i okay first off coupon book i haven't (79:47 - 79:51)
thought about one of those since i was (79:50 - 79:54)
like 14. (79:51 - 79:55)
and but i'm thinking about gen con i (79:54 - 79:57)
know you've thought about them since you (79:55 - 79:59)
were 14. (79:57 - 80:02)
yeah i guess gen khan's book has coupons (79:59 - 80:03)
it's a good book (80:02 - 80:06)
but i'm thinking like the like the (80:03 - 80:08)
check size coupon book that you would (80:06 - 80:11)
get at like the school for like 35 (80:08 - 80:14)
dollars with like 200 worth of savings (80:11 - 80:15)
is that what they're giving out yeah (80:14 - 80:17)
they they give those up for mcdonald's (80:15 - 80:20)
versions of those yeah and it was (80:17 - 80:23)
hot garbage in my bag (80:20 - 80:27)
hot garbage because not only are you (80:23 - 80:29)
not only are you not giving me food (80:27 - 80:31)
which is the entire point why i'm there (80:29 - 80:34)
you're giving me a coupon to get food (80:31 - 80:37)
somewhere else for money i don't have as (80:34 - 80:39)
a child well but it's it's not it's (80:37 - 80:41)
worse than that (80:39 - 80:44)
right because as a child i'm not going (80:41 - 80:47)
to go on my own to use the coupon (80:44 - 80:49)
and (80:47 - 80:52)
if my parent were to take me (80:49 - 80:54)
i am never gonna remember to bring that (80:52 - 80:58)
stupid coupon book (80:54 - 80:58)
true waste of money (80:59 - 81:03)
it's an insult to halloween is what that (81:03 - 81:06)
is (81:05 - 81:09)
yeah it was rare that i got the full (81:06 - 81:11)
candy bar (81:09 - 81:11)
but the full candy bar was very (81:12 - 81:15)
memorable (81:13 - 81:17)
halloween has (81:15 - 81:20)
deceived people into thinking that the (81:17 - 81:22)
mini candy bars are better (81:20 - 81:24)

the neighborhood who keep tossing their (82:03 - 82:07)
balls over her fence (82:04 - 82:09)
here through another will anderson rule (82:07 - 82:13)
of halloween if you are so cheap (82:09 - 82:15)
that you're going to buy a bag of (82:13 - 82:18)
hershey's kisses and give each kid one (82:15 - 82:20)
hershey's kiss oh yeah (82:18 - 82:22)

candies and give each kid one and (82:22 - 82:27)
just don't bother don't bother turn your (82:25 - 82:32)
lights off exactly get out (82:27 - 82:33)

cheapest worst chocolate and you're only (82:33 - 82:37)
giving one (82:35 - 82:39)
like just admit you hate everybody and (82:37 - 82:42)
your life is miserable but but to be (82:39 - 82:43)

it's expensive now to give (82:43 - 82:47)
kids (82:46 - 82:50)
can or like to like park be a house that (82:47 - 82:53)
participates in halloween feels (82:50 - 82:56)
expensive all in or all out that's in (82:53 - 82:59)
between coverage you are not you are (82:56 - 83:01)
just a target at that point (82:59 - 83:03)
be honest we turn our lights off we (83:01 - 83:06)
close all the blinds we hide in the back (83:03 - 83:07)
and we hiss at the children that walk (83:06 - 83:08)
through our neighborhood (83:07 - 83:10)
never never looking at them in the end (83:08 - 83:12)
rule number three (83:10 - 83:14)
and let me see if i can express this the (83:12 - 83:16)
right way (83:14 - 83:18)
if you as a parent (83:16 - 83:22)
are not willing to drive your kid to (83:18 - 83:23)
edina (83:22 - 83:25)
lake harriet (83:23 - 83:28)
lindale i think is the name of the place (83:25 - 83:30)
right where the rich people (83:28 - 83:32)
and the rich houses yeah are spending (83:30 - 83:36)
money on candy your kids deserve what (83:32 - 83:39)
they get yep the cheap garbage candy but (83:36 - 83:41)
do you think that's like bad because now (83:39 - 83:43)
you're taking more kids into a (83:41 - 83:45)
neighborhood they don't belong it's (83:43 - 83:47)
called aspirations (83:45 - 83:49)
they've got candy factories in their (83:47 - 83:51)
basements yeah they're not impinging on (83:49 - 83:53)
their lifestyle (83:51 - 83:55)
jeff bezos can (83:53 - 83:59)
really afford to give kids candy bars (83:55 - 84:01)
he can give every kid in america a candy (83:59 - 84:03)
factory and (84:01 - 84:05)
not even a bat an eye not even see a (84:03 - 84:08)
dent in his income (84:05 - 84:10)
yeah i feel like it like (84:08 - 84:12)
halloween has definitely become a luxury (84:10 - 84:14)
for (84:12 - 84:16)
houses because i'm thinking like oh i (84:14 - 84:19)
want to give out the booster packs (84:16 - 84:20)
and so if i wa (84:19 - 84:23)
like again i have no clue how many kids (84:20 - 84:24)
or what to expect in my neighborhood (84:23 - 84:26)
because i i wasn't here i literally (84:24 - 84:28)
moved here the day after halloween (84:26 - 84:29)
so if i spend (84:28 - 84:31)
what 45 dollars (84:29 - 84:34)
that's 120 packs (84:31 - 84:36)
is that is that too much is that too (84:34 - 84:39)
little probably too many yeah you didn't (84:36 - 84:42)
too many yes uh it's hard to i i don't (84:39 - 84:43)
know the kid makeup in your neighborhood (84:42 - 84:45)
here's the thing (84:43 - 84:46)
if you're (84:45 - 84:48)
if you are (84:46 - 84:52)
a person with no children (84:48 - 84:54)
this is a this is just a loss for you (84:52 - 84:56)
it's not even an exchange of goods oh i (84:54 - 84:57)
see what you're saying i see we're (84:56 - 84:59)
saying halloween is just for other (84:57 - 85:01)
families with kids because at that point (84:59 - 85:03)
you're just swapping food it's like (85:01 - 85:05)
right it's it's like the it's like the (85:03 - 85:07)
uh the exchange at christmas where (85:05 - 85:09)
everyone gets each other a 20 gift card (85:07 - 85:11)
but really nothing happens well yeah if (85:09 - 85:13)
you are if you are a childless couple (85:11 - 85:16)
halloween is a lose-lose for you it's (85:13 - 85:17)
just like property taxes paying for (85:16 - 85:19)
public education i'm getting nothing out (85:17 - 85:21)
of that i get nothing out of this (85:19 - 85:23)
except for a place for kids to go so (85:21 - 85:26)
what you do as an adult with no children (85:23 - 85:28)
is you close everything down and you go (85:26 - 85:30)
to the gay bars because it's gay (85:28 - 85:32)
christmas yeah and you'll have the best (85:30 - 85:34)
time of your life because the gays know (85:32 - 85:36)
how to do halloween (85:34 - 85:37)
and (85:36 - 85:39)
you'll have plenty of tricks and treats (85:37 - 85:42)
at the bar that meet your needs but i (85:39 - 85:43)
see what you're saying like you send (85:42 - 85:46)
your kids out they get like 50 60 worth (85:43 - 85:48)
of candy you gave out like 50 worth of (85:46 - 85:52)
candy it's a wash it's a wash (85:48 - 85:55)
i see (85:52 - 85:58)
speaking of awash question of the week (85:55 - 86:02)
have to believe in the question (85:58 - 86:05)

memorable and which one is your favorite (86:29 - 86:35)
and my favorite is always the same (86:32 - 86:38)
i want to live in existence pseudopolis (86:35 - 86:39)
we do answer this question like once (86:38 - 86:41)
every six months (86:39 - 86:42)
uh and (86:41 - 86:44)
what makes (86:42 - 86:46)
so what makes a town memorable is either (86:44 - 86:48)
it has a unique feature it's the same as (86:46 - 86:50)
the real it has a unique feature it has (86:48 - 86:54)
a cool gym or has exciting things to do (86:50 - 86:56)
if your town has none of those you live (86:54 - 86:58)
in a bad town (86:56 - 86:58)
yeah pseudopolis had has wallace then (87:03 - 87:10)
one and a hidden cavern was legendary at (87:07 - 87:13)
the bottom it's got everything and it's (87:10 - 87:15)
isolated so people had really have to (87:13 - 87:18)
work to get there these exclusivity is (87:15 - 87:21)
my jam (87:18 - 87:21)
i'm a big fan of castelia it's central (87:21 - 87:26)
it's got proximity to everything (87:24 - 87:29)
amusement park (87:26 - 87:31)
it does have cones (87:29 - 87:33)
as a you can take an evening cruise and (87:31 - 87:35)
have pokemon battles on the evening (87:33 - 87:37)
cruise to see the sunset and the many (87:35 - 87:41)
beautiful bridges of unova (87:37 - 87:41)
um (87:41 - 87:45)
mine has not changed it's still (87:42 - 87:48)
goldenrod uh i love (87:45 - 87:50)
uh i love the radio tower (87:48 - 87:52)
they got they got a port they got a (87:50 - 87:54)
train station (87:52 - 87:57)
they got a good they got a good main (87:54 - 87:59)
road (87:57 - 88:00)
that goes straight up and then (87:59 - 88:02)
everything's off to the sides it's very (88:00 - 88:05)
very easy to navigate don't give me that (88:02 - 88:08)
hot mess that is lumio city that's a (88:05 - 88:11)
cristela's got a sewer system (88:08 - 88:13)
you can go down the camera ruin that (88:11 - 88:15)
it's just a circle here what you're (88:13 - 88:17)
saying is you prefer the grid of (88:15 - 88:19)
minneapolis over to the chaos that is (88:17 - 88:20)
saint paul (88:19 - 88:23)
yeah how is saint paul chaotic (88:20 - 88:25)
let me tell you about those uh on on (88:23 - 88:28)
rams and offerings oh dear let's let's (88:25 - 88:29)
talk about the fact that when saint paul (88:28 - 88:31)
was built (88:29 - 88:33)
not only did they just build roads (88:31 - 88:36)
however they let whoever was building (88:33 - 88:37)
the road (88:36 - 88:39)
named the road which is why there's no (88:37 - 88:42)
naming convention that makes sense in st (88:39 - 88:44)
paul for their streets (88:42 - 88:47)
it's the wild west over there (88:44 - 88:49)
uh this is from scott from our youtube (88:47 - 88:50)
channel if you're watching on youtube (88:49 - 88:52)
feel free to like comment subscribe all (88:50 - 88:53)
that stuff that you know helps out (88:52 - 88:54)
youtube (88:53 - 88:56)
as we lead up to scarlet and violet (88:54 - 88:58)
uh and if you're not watching on youtube (88:56 - 88:59)
thanks for listening to the audio (88:58 - 89:01)
version (88:59 - 89:03)
uh scott says a question from me do you (89:01 - 89:05)
think the catching mechanic we had in (89:03 - 89:06)
arceus will make a return for scarlet (89:05 - 89:08)
and violet i haven't seen any any (89:06 - 89:10)
evidence so it's uh so far in the (89:08 - 89:11)
trailers bit worried that we'll go back (89:10 - 89:12)
to battling and catching every single (89:11 - 89:14)
pokemon i really enjoyed catching (89:12 - 89:16)
pokemon and arceus without the battle (89:14 - 89:17)
uh (89:16 - 89:19)
though hoping i just missed it in the (89:17 - 89:22)
news slash trailer (89:19 - 89:22)
right no they have not (89:26 - 89:31)
identified how it's going to be (89:28 - 89:34)
i believe it will be like argus i i (89:31 - 89:36)
think there will be i think that we'll (89:34 - 89:40)
have options for it yeah (89:36 - 89:40)
here's my fear though i have a feeling (89:40 - 89:44)
like (89:42 - 89:48)
it's gonna be a multiplayer only option (89:44 - 89:52)
oh sneaking toss is multiplayer only nah (89:48 - 89:55)
nah i don't think so or i think or the (89:52 - 89:56)
non-multiplayer option yes the (89:55 - 89:58)
non-multiplayer (89:56 - 90:00)
um (89:58 - 90:02)
ever since they did the thing they did (90:00 - 90:04)
in sword and shield which is show that (90:02 - 90:06)
first trailer and i i remember this (90:04 - 90:07)
first trailer so much because literally (90:06 - 90:09)
the next day i left for japan they (90:07 - 90:11)
showed that first trailer and they (90:09 - 90:14)
purposely did not show pokemon walking (90:11 - 90:17)
around in the overworld they held on to (90:14 - 90:19)
that and they showed the old style which (90:17 - 90:21)
is exclamation point in the grass (90:19 - 90:24)
trainer walk-in (90:21 - 90:24)
and then the two pokemon look at each (90:25 - 90:29)
other um (90:26 - 90:29)
and (90:30 - 90:33)
i (90:32 - 90:34)
believe they're doing the same thing (90:33 - 90:39)
here they are purposely not showing (90:34 - 90:41)
certain stuff because (90:39 - 90:43)
they i don't know they're (90:41 - 90:44)
i don't know if they learn anything from (90:43 - 90:46)
the sword and shield release cycle (90:44 - 90:48)
they're like holding on to things a lot (90:46 - 90:49)
closer (90:48 - 90:50)
this time (90:49 - 90:53)
but yeah i i think it would return i do (90:50 - 90:54)
think there's going to be some limits to (90:53 - 90:56)
it and i i do think that like once you (90:54 - 90:58)
go into that multiplayer mode that (90:56 - 91:00)
they're going to either chop off (90:58 - 91:03)
features that are only limited to (91:00 - 91:04)
um (91:03 - 91:06)
a single player experience (91:04 - 91:07)
and that was like (91:06 - 91:10)
very um somebody said (91:07 - 91:12)
uh gosh i can't remember what game it (91:10 - 91:14)
was it's not like xenoblade or something (91:12 - 91:16)
where like you weren't allowed to do (91:14 - 91:19)
no genji it was gangshin impact because (91:16 - 91:21)
in genji you can join other people and (91:19 - 91:22)
they said if somebody joined you in (91:21 - 91:23)
genji and impact you weren't allowed to (91:22 - 91:25)
do any of the story missions you could (91:23 - 91:26)
do everything else but main story (91:25 - 91:28)
missions were locked when people joined (91:26 - 91:29)
you (91:28 - 91:30)
and then i also think about animal (91:29 - 91:33)
crossing yep when somebody like flew to (91:30 - 91:35)
your island which took about like 14 (91:33 - 91:37)
weeks for that internet connection to (91:35 - 91:39)
like solidify and then like one person (91:37 - 91:40)
would fly over and then they like get (91:39 - 91:42)
disconnected after 40 seconds and then (91:40 - 91:43)
you'd have to wait for another 14 weeks (91:42 - 91:45)
for them to like properly disconnect (91:43 - 91:46)
from your switch (91:45 - 91:48)
this is like the tip most worth it (91:46 - 91:50)
anyways when somebody actually arrived (91:48 - 91:51)
to your island certain things would be (91:50 - 91:53)
restricted like oh you couldn't move a (91:51 - 91:55)
bridge you couldn't talk to tom nook you (91:53 - 91:57)
couldn't like move like one table in (91:55 - 91:59)
your house like three centimeters over (91:57 - 92:01)
because somebody was like also (91:59 - 92:05)
so i do i do strongly believe that like (92:01 - 92:06)
even though we are getting this (92:05 - 92:08)
multiplayer experience we're gonna get (92:06 - 92:10)
probably some really annoying (92:08 - 92:12)
restrictions with that yep (92:10 - 92:13)
um (92:12 - 92:15)
but i don't think i i think the catching (92:13 - 92:18)
mechanic is coming back there's no way (92:15 - 92:20)
and i think they're going to (92:18 - 92:22)
do both where if you want to do it the (92:20 - 92:23)
old-fashioned way it's there (92:22 - 92:25)
if you wanted to do it the new way it's (92:23 - 92:28)
there um (92:25 - 92:31)
like legends to me just felt very much (92:28 - 92:33)
like a let's go pikachu let's go eevee (92:31 - 92:35)
of like we're using this game to test (92:33 - 92:38)
the mechanic that we are putting in a (92:35 - 92:39)
future (92:38 - 92:42)
main series whatever like big (92:39 - 92:43)
number i know i should say a number game (92:42 - 92:45)
because that's what really what they are (92:43 - 92:46)
at this point like (92:45 - 92:49)
gen 8 is gen 8 this is gen 9 (92:46 - 92:51)
and let's go pikachu let's go eevee was (92:49 - 92:53)
very much like how do you think people (92:51 - 92:55)
would feel if pokemon were just walking (92:53 - 92:58)
around and our pc was anywhere and (92:55 - 93:00)
people were like we like this i'm not (92:58 - 93:01)
good because (93:00 - 93:04)
we were testing that for jenna's (93:01 - 93:06)
and legends was very much like how do (93:04 - 93:07)
you think people would feel if we just (93:06 - 93:09)
you know change the catching and you (93:07 - 93:11)
could just kind of walk everywhere good (93:09 - 93:14)
because we're testing that for gen 9. (93:11 - 93:16)
yeah (93:14 - 93:16)
i think they've really kind of figured (93:17 - 93:22)
it out for their (93:18 - 93:24)
much as people say game freaks and (93:22 - 93:25)
confident i don't know they got a (93:24 - 93:28)
well-oiled machine working yeah (93:25 - 93:30)
they know what they're doing whether we (93:28 - 93:31)
like it or not they know what they're (93:30 - 93:33)
doing yep (93:31 - 93:36)
hey since everything went online like (93:33 - 93:37)
they're collecting your data and (93:36 - 93:40)
learning and running reports (93:37 - 93:40)
yeah um (93:42 - 93:44)
was there any other (93:46 - 93:50)
questions that we can quickly do (93:51 - 93:54)
no a lot of a lot of good comments this (94:02 - 94:06)
week though a lot of good discussion (94:04 - 94:08)
about like difficulty or whether jim (94:06 - 94:10)
should scale or not scale (94:08 - 94:11)
um (94:10 - 94:14)
mechanics uh anyways (94:11 - 94:16)
uh will pokemon of the week all right so (94:14 - 94:18)
last week's pokemon (94:16 - 94:20)
very simple (94:18 - 94:23)
no one knows yet if it will evolve but i (94:20 - 94:25)
suspect this pokemon will evolve into a (94:23 - 94:28)
pokemon called beagle spelled (94:25 - 94:30)
b-e-a-g-e-l (94:28 - 94:32)
but steve you had a better (94:30 - 94:35)
interpretation i did (94:32 - 94:37)
doberman (94:35 - 94:39)
no i'm out on all did you did you hear (94:37 - 94:41)
that from somebody (94:39 - 94:44)
uh i i was um i went through twitter and (94:41 - 94:46)
i pulled the best ones but yeah doberman (94:44 - 94:49)
was like one of my favorite ones (94:46 - 94:49)
what was the other one a br (94:50 - 94:54)
bread (94:53 - 94:57)
was it (94:54 - 94:57)
i'll look him up you can you can you can (94:57 - 95:01)
uh continue your (94:59 - 95:03)
well i mean that's that's it so greg's (95:01 - 95:05)
got a guess (95:03 - 95:07)
it's (95:05 - 95:07)
damper (95:10 - 95:12)
oh (95:11 - 95:13)
yeah (95:12 - 95:14)
it's fido (95:13 - 95:16)
fido (95:14 - 95:17)
that is correct we've got to think of (95:16 - 95:21)
all the baked good (95:17 - 95:21)
all right these were the four best (95:21 - 95:25)
because i i scoured the internet for the (95:23 - 95:27)
four best i this is why i think that's (95:25 - 95:30)
just people who replied to you correct (95:27 - 95:31)
no no (95:30 - 95:32)
no i was like looking at like retweets (95:31 - 95:37)
and stuff and so i got pure bread (95:32 - 95:37)
no that's that is a style not a dog (95:37 - 95:44)
i got doberman i like that a lot (95:40 - 95:46)
bark lava (95:44 - 95:49)
no to too convoluted (95:46 - 95:50)
yeah it really only applies to like (95:49 - 95:54)
europeans also uh baklava is a dessert (95:50 - 95:56)
it's not (95:54 - 96:00)
and then bread angry (95:56 - 96:00)
i think doberman is really good though i (96:04 - 96:08)
don't know enough about (96:06 - 96:10)
like spanish (96:08 - 96:12)
baked goods (96:10 - 96:14)
i think the bark lava how did you you (96:12 - 96:16)
said it very fancy (96:14 - 96:18)
bark lava (96:16 - 96:21)
bark lava baklava it's baklava is the (96:18 - 96:22)
dessert it's greek (96:21 - 96:26)
oh it's greek yeah yeah (96:22 - 96:27)
because when somebody first said that (96:26 - 96:28)
and everyone freaked out about it i was (96:27 - 96:30)
like i don't i don't get the joke i (96:28 - 96:31)
don't know (96:30 - 96:32)
it's like (96:31 - 96:34)
mediterranean i think is the right way (96:32 - 96:37)
but it's i don't think baklava's is (96:34 - 96:39)
spanish (96:37 - 96:41)
got it (96:39 - 96:42)
all right (96:41 - 96:45)
well there's no shiny there's no shuffle (96:42 - 96:46)
there's nothing yet (96:45 - 96:50)
super cute i want i want to know if (96:46 - 96:53)
one of the terror types is everything (96:50 - 96:55)
because i wanted everything fido a (96:53 - 96:56)
little bang (96:55 - 97:00)
but then it has to evolve into being (96:56 - 97:01)
so you get every time everything type (97:00 - 97:02)
beagle (97:01 - 97:05)
[Laughter] (97:02 - 97:07)
all right (97:05 - 97:10)
what if it evolves into a pizza man that (97:07 - 97:11)
would be really (97:10 - 97:12)
i'm into that (97:11 - 97:13)
no (97:12 - 97:15)
all right this week's pokemon (97:13 - 97:18)
this pokemon one of my favorites can (97:15 - 97:20)
exist in six possible varieties (97:18 - 97:23)
originally only three of those varieties (97:20 - 97:25)
could be caught with a pokeball (97:23 - 97:29)
in ultrasone and ultramoon four of those (97:25 - 97:30)
varieties could be caught with a (97:29 - 97:32)
pokeball (97:30 - 97:34)
one of the varieties can be seen while (97:32 - 97:36)
playing the game but has never been able (97:34 - 97:38)
to be caught evolved or received through (97:36 - 97:41)
distribution (97:38 - 97:41)
