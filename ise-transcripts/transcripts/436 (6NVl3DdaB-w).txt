[Music] (0:50 - 0:54)
i want to hear some spice in your voice (0:51 - 0:55)
i want to hear some (0:54 - 0:58)
it's been a week i get to talk to you in (0:55 - 0:59)
person that sort of (0:58 - 1:02)
energy that that i bring to the table (0:59 - 1:02)
every time (1:02 - 1:05)
i go i got energy we got things to talk (1:02 - 1:06)
about today (1:05 - 1:10)
no no will will is uh (1:06 - 1:13)
traveling which is probably better (1:10 - 1:14)
before thanksgiving than after (1:13 - 1:15)
thanksgiving (1:14 - 1:19)
some would say i guess true (1:15 - 1:21)
[Music] (1:19 - 1:23)
look you're talking to a person that (1:21 - 1:24)
does not want to leave his house right (1:23 - 1:26)
now and hasn't for like a week and a (1:24 - 1:27)
half so (1:26 - 1:32)
yeah it's uh bobby's here (1:27 - 1:34)
hey uh and apparently i'm a sucker (1:32 - 1:35)
according to greg (1:34 - 1:38)
yeah you're the pokemon go sucker kind (1:35 - 1:39)
of how many (1:38 - 1:42)
how many a how many (1:39 - 1:44)
incubators have you bought since the (1:42 - 1:46)
last time (1:44 - 1:46)
okay i only bought i only bought two (1:47 - 1:52)
yesterday to hatch the magma the shiny (1:50 - 1:54)
or the magbees (1:52 - 1:57)
and i did get one the shiny one so that (1:54 - 1:58)
was exciting (1:57 - 2:00)
so many remote raid passes have you (1:58 - 2:01)
purchased how many (2:00 - 2:02)
oh i don't want to talk about remote (2:01 - 2:05)
grade passes in way too deep on remote (2:02 - 2:06)
raid passes (2:05 - 2:09)
see so here's the question on the table (2:06 - 2:12)
was i wrong no (2:09 - 2:14)
[Music] (2:12 - 2:15)
you're not wrong i just don't like to (2:14 - 2:18)
admit it that's all (2:15 - 2:20)
i feel like that's the common theme with (2:18 - 2:24)
most pokemon fans (2:20 - 2:24)
look i pulled bravery so there you go (2:24 - 2:29)
but what did that cost you what did that (2:28 - 2:31)
cost you greg zero (2:29 - 2:33)
because i only use the the pitiful (2:31 - 2:35)
stream of gems they give me in game i (2:33 - 2:37)
don't think greg is saying such control (2:35 - 2:40)
spend any money masters i spent ten (2:37 - 2:40)
dollars once (2:40 - 2:43)
oh did you do the for the like permanent (2:40 - 2:45)
incubator right (2:43 - 2:48)
no no this is way back when there was (2:45 - 2:51)
i was testing pull rates i think i was (2:48 - 2:52)
doing something stupid (2:51 - 2:54)
i was seeing the difference between paid (2:52 - 2:55)
gym like if there was an actual (2:54 - 2:57)
difference between paid gyms (2:55 - 2:59)
and non-paid gym spoiler alert there (2:57 - 3:01)
wasn't (2:59 - 3:02)
but i figured you know i was having (3:01 - 3:04)
enough fun (3:02 - 3:06)
at that time oh to go back to talk to (3:04 - 3:08)
myself (3:06 - 3:09)
that i thought oh i'll give them ten (3:08 - 3:11)
dollars for this game (3:09 - 3:14)
i should have not done that (3:11 - 3:14)
there there is a bit of pokemon go news (3:14 - 3:19)
we got some pokemon masters news we got (3:18 - 3:21)
some cafe mix but we're going to start (3:19 - 3:25)
with some sword and shield news here (3:21 - 3:26)
[Music] (3:25 - 3:28)
by the time this podcast goes up this (3:26 - 3:29)
will be over but (3:28 - 3:32)
another month another raid event in (3:29 - 3:33)
sword and shield so (3:32 - 3:34)
uh overall pretty happy they keep doing (3:33 - 3:37)
this this is off pokemon.com (3:34 - 3:40)
they actually didn't tweet this at least (3:37 - 3:41)
that i saw over the weekend (3:40 - 3:42)
i was waiting for them to tweet it i (3:41 - 3:44)
don't think they did uh maybe there's (3:42 - 3:46)
too much on the social media (3:44 - 3:48)
plate i guess too many memes to tweet (3:46 - 3:50)
before (3:48 - 3:53)
tweeting this but it's tracked down (3:50 - 3:54)
shiny squivet (3:53 - 3:58)
in and more in max raid battles the very (3:54 - 4:00)
loving pokemon is the star of a weekend (3:58 - 4:02)
long event in sword and shield (4:00 - 4:04)
somebody was uh really happy to write (4:02 - 4:06)
this first sentence things are getting (4:04 - 4:08)
nuts in pokemon sword and shield from (4:06 - 4:10)
thursday november 19th from 4 to sunday (4:08 - 4:15)
november 22nd to 4 pst (4:10 - 4:17)
will appear more frequently in max ray (4:15 - 4:18)
battles while you're battling this (4:17 - 4:20)
cheeky pokemon you'll have a better (4:18 - 4:22)
chance of encountering a shiny squivet (4:20 - 4:24)
uh the data miners and sarah b said that (4:22 - 4:26)
was two percent (4:24 - 4:28)
in five star raids during they tweeted (4:26 - 4:29)
it (4:28 - 4:32)
oh they did tweet it okay on the 20th oh (4:29 - 4:34)
wow they tweeted it earlier i was i was (4:32 - 4:35)
expecting the (4:34 - 4:38)
the the saturday tweet oh it was ahead (4:35 - 4:39)
of the memes (4:38 - 4:41)
yeah way ahead of their memes they had (4:39 - 4:42)
to go through a lot of memes to get to (4:41 - 4:43)
this (4:42 - 4:47)
they do like four a day they do a lot (4:43 - 4:50)
yeah they do they just won um the people (4:47 - 4:51)
who (4:50 - 4:54)
uh run the social media i think just won (4:51 - 4:55)
an award for it (4:54 - 4:57)
for yeah i saw that that was exciting (4:55 - 4:59)
during the event you also notice the (4:57 - 5:00)
increased number of cherubi (4:59 - 5:03)
amungus schnattic ingredient these (5:00 - 5:05)
pokemon are very hungry uh because (5:03 - 5:08)
berries are plentiful and that's pretty (5:05 - 5:09)
much it (5:08 - 5:10)
uh so the rewards for this was actually (5:09 - 5:12)
really good uh (5:10 - 5:14)
they rewarded a bunch of the berries (5:12 - 5:16)
that re reduced your (5:14 - 5:19)
evs um if you want if you were into (5:16 - 5:21)
competitive battling so (5:19 - 5:25)
it's always nice one to do raids (5:21 - 5:27)
that feel like an event and two it's (5:25 - 5:29)
nice when the rewards are good (5:27 - 5:30)
even if you don't get a shiny you still (5:29 - 5:33)
feel like you're not wasting your time (5:30 - 5:35)
also you got to max knuckle giant (5:33 - 5:39)
squirrels in the face all i did all (5:35 - 5:40)
weekend (5:39 - 5:42)
and i never had a single shiny appear in (5:40 - 5:45)
my game no shiny for you bobby are you (5:42 - 5:46)
i mean i've caught them i've got them in (5:45 - 5:48)
others but (5:46 - 5:51)
all of my dens were just normal cheeks (5:48 - 5:52)
that i blasted (5:51 - 5:55)
into the universe (5:52 - 5:55)
uh i haven't no i didn't actually (5:55 - 5:59)
haven't played sword and shield in a (5:57 - 5:59)
little while (5:59 - 6:03)
um i was playing and i still need to go (5:59 - 6:05)
back actually and get the rest of the (6:03 - 6:07)
pikachu uh (6:05 - 6:10)
gifts before november 30th but uh you (6:07 - 6:12)
are running out of time sir bobby we (6:10 - 6:12)
talked about this (6:12 - 6:14)
i know we totally talked about this and (6:12 - 6:16)
i do we've talked about this multiple (6:14 - 6:17)
weeks (6:16 - 6:20)
well i ordered i got an xbox series s (6:17 - 6:22)
last week and so i've been kind of (6:20 - 6:25)
there's no games on that there's no (6:22 - 6:27)
new games on it but i haven't had an (6:25 - 6:29)
xbox in years (6:27 - 6:33)
so i've been actually playing old xbox (6:29 - 6:34)
games or does it pretend to play (6:33 - 6:37)
i think it plays old ones yeah it put (6:34 - 6:38)
well (6:37 - 6:40)
i have the uh that series s doesn't have (6:38 - 6:42)
a disc drive so it's all digital (6:40 - 6:43)
you can like redownload games you (6:42 - 6:44)
purchased before on the xbox one and (6:43 - 6:46)
stuff and play those so (6:44 - 6:50)
it works i i have to put on uh a tinfoil (6:46 - 6:53)
hat theory here for the squivet raids (6:50 - 6:56)
there has been a lot of these this year (6:53 - 6:58)
obviously the first time they did like a (6:56 - 7:00)
promoted raid event was (6:58 - 7:02)
over christmas last year which was like (7:00 - 7:04)
the deli bird but there was no shiny (7:02 - 7:05)
deli bird it was just (7:04 - 7:07)
here's a bunch of deli birds and i think (7:05 - 7:08)
deli bird was dropping (7:07 - 7:10)
some item that people wanted so it was (7:08 - 7:12)
like worth it to do (7:10 - 7:16)
it was dropping a lot of the xl candy (7:12 - 7:18)
yeah it was a lot of candies a lot of (7:16 - 7:19)
candy and then (7:18 - 7:21)
like two weeks after that they did the (7:19 - 7:24)
new year's eve magikarp event (7:21 - 7:26)
which everyone lost their mind for (7:24 - 7:27)
because it was like non-stop shiny (7:26 - 7:28)
magikarps it was like one in eight (7:27 - 7:30)
chance of getting a shiny magikarp (7:28 - 7:33)
and it was magikarp and i think magikarp (7:30 - 7:35)
was dropping really good rewards too i (7:33 - 7:36)
think it was dropping a lot of candy (7:35 - 7:38)
as well so you're just like no the (7:36 - 7:40)
magikarp was dropping money (7:38 - 7:42)
it was dropping like nuggets and stuff (7:40 - 7:45)
yeah yeah nuggets big yeah (7:42 - 7:47)
nuggets i feel like they didn't do (7:45 - 7:48)
anything until the like (7:47 - 7:50)
starter stuff where they put squirtle (7:48 - 7:52)
bulbasaur charmander (7:50 - 7:55)
and mewtwo into raids and that was like (7:52 - 7:57)
end of february early march (7:55 - 7:59)
um and that was good because i remember (7:57 - 8:01)
that was dropping life orb (7:59 - 8:03)
fire orb and toxic orb if i remember (8:01 - 8:04)
yeah (8:03 - 8:06)
but you couldn't catch the mewtwo or (8:04 - 8:07)
something right yeah you couldn't catch (8:06 - 8:08)
the me too (8:07 - 8:10)
and it was difficult the first day until (8:08 - 8:11)
everybody figured out what you had to do (8:10 - 8:14)
yes right right people like rates and (8:11 - 8:14)
mmos (8:14 - 8:16)
people were bringing their shinies to (8:14 - 8:17)
flex and then me too would just destroy (8:16 - 8:20)
them (8:17 - 8:20)
and some people still brought their (8:21 - 8:24)
chinese to flex and the rest of us had (8:22 - 8:25)
to carry you (8:24 - 8:30)
yeah vince and then um there was (8:25 - 8:32)
there was a bunch that kind of started (8:30 - 8:34)
early summer late spring which was the (8:32 - 8:36)
pikachu event which was in august (8:34 - 8:38)
and then there was like the wailord (8:36 - 8:40)
event that was in september (8:38 - 8:42)
and then there was the gorgeous event (8:40 - 8:45)
last month and then there was a clefable (8:42 - 8:46)
event (8:45 - 8:49)
somewhere in there somewhere (8:46 - 8:51)
that might have been so yeah somewhere (8:49 - 8:53)
there there's a clefable event (8:51 - 8:56)
um but not every month this year had the (8:53 - 8:57)
event there was also the zero horror (8:56 - 8:59)
event in june (8:57 - 9:02)
but in all those events they've like (8:59 - 9:03)
changed the (9:02 - 9:06)
catch rate and they've done this before (9:03 - 9:07)
so like magikarp (9:06 - 9:09)
was like pretty much guaranteed whether (9:07 - 9:11)
you were a guest or a host (9:09 - 9:13)
because it's a magikarp it's pretty easy (9:11 - 9:14)
to catch (9:13 - 9:17)
pikachu seemed pretty easy to catch for (9:14 - 9:19)
both guests and hosts (9:17 - 9:22)
the whale lord seemed kind of hard for (9:19 - 9:24)
everyone to catch because like waylord (9:22 - 9:24)
has like a (9:24 - 9:27)
i mean technically whaler has a harder (9:24 - 9:29)
catch rate than a magikarp or pikachu (9:27 - 9:32)
uh i don't remember the fable that well (9:29 - 9:33)
uh gore guys seemed pretty easy i like i (9:32 - 9:35)
don't think i failed the gorgeous when i (9:33 - 9:37)
found it shiny i don't think i (9:35 - 9:38)
failed the gorgeous when i was a guest (9:37 - 9:41)
either because i was using repeat balls (9:38 - 9:43)
but for this event anyways for this (9:41 - 9:45)
event it seemed (9:43 - 9:48)
almost impossible to catch a squivet (9:45 - 9:52)
which outside of raids squabbit (9:48 - 9:54)
has the same catch rate as like a pidgey (9:52 - 9:55)
or uh (9:54 - 9:57)
rattata like squabbit has the best catch (9:55 - 9:58)
rate which is (9:57 - 10:02)
255. but if you were a host (9:58 - 10:05)
and it was shiny and this is and sarah b (10:02 - 10:06)
i believe tweeted this (10:05 - 10:08)
if you it if it was shiny and you were (10:06 - 10:09)
the host it was guaranteed for you no (10:08 - 10:11)
matter what (10:09 - 10:13)
and i tested that over the weekend on my (10:11 - 10:14)
twitch streams with (10:13 - 10:18)
my viewers and they were throwing (10:14 - 10:20)
premier balls or poke balls or like (10:18 - 10:22)
dream balls and if they were the host (10:20 - 10:23)
and it was shiny (10:22 - 10:26)
i don't think any no one failed it there (10:23 - 10:28)
was very very very very few people as a (10:26 - 10:29)
guest (10:28 - 10:32)
who went to try to catch it (10:29 - 10:35)
and failed even with something like a (10:32 - 10:36)
repeat ball (10:35 - 10:39)
which should be a 100 catch rate on a (10:36 - 10:41)
255 (10:39 - 10:43)
pokemon but obviously promoted raids can (10:41 - 10:45)
adjust catch races catch rate (10:43 - 10:48)
catch rates like we're talking about but (10:45 - 10:49)
yeah i i even failed to squive it (10:48 - 10:51)
shiny squivet repeat ball is like the (10:49 - 10:53)
best chance better than like a dust ball (10:51 - 10:54)
and everything (10:53 - 10:57)
um and it didn't work and sounds like (10:54 - 10:59)
greg you had that issue as well (10:57 - 11:03)
yes uh i've had i had multiple (10:59 - 11:06)
repeat ball failures in other people's (11:03 - 11:07)
rates because i never found one on my (11:06 - 11:10)
own so i can't confirm about the (11:07 - 11:13)
100 catch right in your own but uh yeah (11:10 - 11:14)
i failed (11:13 - 11:16)
i failed a lot it's very frustrating (11:14 - 11:19)
because i've seen a lot of shinies (11:16 - 11:22)
and i only have a few but yeah repeat (11:19 - 11:24)
paul should have been (11:22 - 11:26)
i'm like it's just a squove it like yeah (11:24 - 11:28)
super easy to catch just (11:26 - 11:31)
no it's not it's just a rot one squirrel (11:28 - 11:34)
so my my tin foil hat theory is (11:31 - 11:37)
now game freak is mad about people with (11:34 - 11:38)
past (11:37 - 11:41)
the events so we've talked about like (11:38 - 11:43)
you you you can like guarantee a shiny (11:41 - 11:43)
in a (11:43 - 11:45)
in a raid by you know moving your clock (11:43 - 11:46)
forward (11:45 - 11:49)
and so when these events happen instead (11:46 - 11:51)
of people going and doing raids (11:49 - 11:53)
they'll just move the clock forward find (11:51 - 11:55)
it and then host it for people (11:53 - 11:58)
maybe they changed it or they (11:55 - 12:01)
or this is just a weird coincidence to (11:58 - 12:02)
well we don't want people (12:01 - 12:05)
hosting anymore because then people (12:02 - 12:06)
aren't actually playing they're just (12:05 - 12:07)
looking for somebody hosting it and then (12:06 - 12:08)
they're just (12:07 - 12:10)
like even even if you're not a person (12:08 - 12:12)
that normally hosts you could be like (12:10 - 12:15)
well i found it and i'm gonna keep (12:12 - 12:15)
resetting it (12:15 - 12:18)
until all my like seven friends get it (12:15 - 12:20)
and then we're done for the weekend (12:18 - 12:21)
because the host would just have to turn (12:20 - 12:23)
their game on or (12:21 - 12:26)
you know quit the raid the as long as (12:23 - 12:28)
the host doesn't catch it'll still exist (12:26 - 12:31)
but if they changed it to well guests (12:28 - 12:33)
have a very small chance of catching and (12:31 - 12:35)
the host is guaranteed to catch it (12:33 - 12:38)
then you're not incentified incentivized (12:35 - 12:39)
to host (12:38 - 12:42)
and your friends are now incentivized (12:39 - 12:46)
to find their own and help out (12:42 - 12:47)
yeah this is that's exactly what i (12:46 - 12:48)
thought as soon as you started talking (12:47 - 12:50)
about this catch rate (12:48 - 12:53)
yeah but it doesn't work that way like (12:50 - 12:54)
people are still gonna host and keep it (12:53 - 12:56)
open until everybody gets it (12:54 - 12:58)
it just takes longer of course but i bet (12:56 - 12:59)
like i could see that (12:58 - 13:01)
someone hosting being just less likely (12:59 - 13:03)
to do it thinking like well i just i'm (13:01 - 13:04)
gonna just gonna catch it (13:03 - 13:07)
first anyways and it could take hours (13:04 - 13:07)
for (13:07 - 13:09)
my friends to all catch it so they can (13:07 - 13:11)
just go get their own yeah but (13:09 - 13:15)
it's still only a two percent chance of (13:11 - 13:17)
finding one so the catch rate is still (13:15 - 13:18)
higher (13:17 - 13:22)
than finding one on your own so if it (13:18 - 13:23)
if you have your friends do it for over (13:22 - 13:25)
an hour guarantee for your friends in (13:23 - 13:27)
that hour we'll catch it whereas i spent (13:25 - 13:29)
all weekend trying to find one in my (13:27 - 13:30)
game (13:29 - 13:32)
over multiple hours and i never found (13:30 - 13:34)
one how many wishing pieces you think (13:32 - 13:34)
you burned (13:34 - 13:37)
through uh i think i burned through 30 (13:34 - 13:38)
because i just don't spend it on pushing (13:37 - 13:41)
pieces i was like i'll do it just once (13:38 - 13:43)
and then i was like nope i'm done and i (13:41 - 13:45)
did find a bunch of five stars (13:43 - 13:46)
but they just weren't shiny i probably (13:45 - 13:49)
went through like 200 pieces (13:46 - 13:52)
oh my gosh um (13:49 - 13:54)
i don't think that they it's like a (13:52 - 13:55)
foolproof plan (13:54 - 13:57)
i mean like obviously the biggest the (13:55 - 13:58)
best thing would be just if they just (13:57 - 13:59)
fix the issue (13:58 - 14:03)
um but i think it might just be (13:59 - 14:05)
something that they could at least test (14:03 - 14:07)
and see uh (14:05 - 14:09)
you know what happens i mean maybe they (14:07 - 14:10)
come back from this and they're like oh (14:09 - 14:11)
nothing changed (14:10 - 14:14)
so they go on doing their thing but um (14:11 - 14:16)
it's definitely more of an inconvenience (14:14 - 14:18)
for the host right (14:16 - 14:20)
right because like they have to keep (14:18 - 14:21)
resetting (14:20 - 14:22)
and as long as they were doing that (14:21 - 14:25)
anyways well yeah (14:22 - 14:26)
just for a longer amount of time though (14:25 - 14:28)
it's just longer yeah just longer (14:26 - 14:31)
because we don't know what the actual (14:28 - 14:32)
like like sarah b (14:31 - 14:35)
never tweeted like the guest have a five (14:32 - 14:36)
percent catch right right we don't know (14:35 - 14:39)
i know i know she tweeted though the (14:36 - 14:40)
worst or something yeah i don't know (14:39 - 14:41)
tweeted like (14:40 - 14:43)
i don't know what the worst chance or (14:41 - 14:45)
something is though (14:43 - 14:47)
is the worst like a one percent uh no i (14:45 - 14:48)
don't know he like literally said the (14:47 - 14:49)
words like (14:48 - 14:51)
if you're hosting it's guaranteed if (14:49 - 14:52)
you're a guest it's (14:51 - 14:54)
and then the words he said were like the (14:52 - 14:56)
worst chances are or something like (14:54 - 14:58)
the least chance or something like that (14:56 - 14:59)
he's (14:58 - 15:00)
very awkwardly turning into the pokemon (14:59 - 15:03)
company by not just saying numbers (15:00 - 15:04)
yeah he didn't say numbers he used a (15:03 - 15:06)
phrase like terrible chances or (15:04 - 15:08)
something like that (15:06 - 15:09)
i think if if you were if you were (15:08 - 15:10)
somebody that was hosting every one of (15:09 - 15:12)
these events the clefable the waylord (15:10 - 15:13)
the pikachu (15:12 - 15:17)
the whatever and now all of a sudden (15:13 - 15:20)
you have to do it a lot more times (15:17 - 15:22)
if it takes longer and it's on the (15:20 - 15:24)
weekend and it's right before a holiday (15:22 - 15:27)
in america at least people are gonna do (15:24 - 15:27)
it (15:27 - 15:31)
okay so so your argument is this is not (15:27 - 15:33)
affecting the people that are already (15:31 - 15:36)
resetting here okay but what i mean okay (15:33 - 15:38)
but that i still think that was the (15:36 - 15:41)
maybe the potential uh attempt (15:38 - 15:42)
from i think that's maybe what they (15:41 - 15:44)
thought but i don't think that's what (15:42 - 15:44)
happened (15:44 - 15:47)
but what about the people joining so i i (15:44 - 15:47)
would (15:47 - 15:50)
i would argue those people are even more (15:47 - 15:51)
lazy (15:50 - 15:53)
because they they're they're not turning (15:51 - 15:55)
off their game and setting their clock (15:53 - 15:56)
forward like (15:55 - 15:58)
however many times to do it for shiny (15:56 - 16:00)
they're just looking for the hand me out (15:58 - 16:03)
and i get this all the time on twitch (16:00 - 16:05)
or somebody will come in and they'll be (16:03 - 16:07)
like hey is anyone (16:05 - 16:10)
hosting we i got this this weekend right (16:07 - 16:12)
it wasn't a lot it was more it was more (16:10 - 16:13)
um (16:12 - 16:16)
when sword and shield first came out but (16:13 - 16:17)
people would come in and they'd be like (16:16 - 16:18)
is anyone hosting this event (16:17 - 16:21)
i'm looking for the shiny and so (16:18 - 16:24)
if assuming tin foil hat they did this (16:21 - 16:25)
to (16:24 - 16:28)
crack down on that those people might be (16:25 - 16:30)
like oh this is taking too long i've (16:28 - 16:32)
done this like seven times and i haven't (16:30 - 16:33)
caught the scroll of it i'm just gonna (16:32 - 16:34)
give up (16:33 - 16:36)
and or i'm just gonna look for it myself (16:34 - 16:37)
it could affect those people (16:36 - 16:39)
it could but i mean we have to we're (16:37 - 16:41)
dealing against the time sync (16:39 - 16:44)
problem too like once you cross the (16:41 - 16:46)
limit of i've done this seven times well (16:44 - 16:48)
i've already done this so many times (16:46 - 16:50)
i'm already so far down this path i'm (16:48 - 16:53)
gonna keep going until i get it (16:50 - 16:55)
like there's equal chances that they're (16:53 - 16:57)
gonna bail as they are gonna hunker down (16:55 - 16:58)
until they get it because now they're (16:57 - 17:00)
mad at it (16:58 - 17:03)
like both are in play i don't think this (17:00 - 17:03)
worked (17:03 - 17:06)
as they intended it to i think it was a (17:03 - 17:06)
test (17:06 - 17:08)
i don't think it did probably what they (17:06 - 17:10)
think what they were thinking it would (17:08 - 17:11)
do because i thought people were like (17:10 - 17:13)
i'm having it open for the next 24 hours (17:11 - 17:15)
just let me know and i'll give you a (17:13 - 17:16)
code (17:15 - 17:20)
okay cool (17:16 - 17:20)
yeah for somebody like me who's playing (17:21 - 17:25)
every day it's really easy for me to (17:24 - 17:26)
like (17:25 - 17:29)
go to the isle of armor go to the beach (17:26 - 17:31)
where like the three raid dens are (17:29 - 17:32)
literally sitting next to each other (17:31 - 17:35)
and just go in this triangle of dropping (17:32 - 17:36)
wishing pieces (17:35 - 17:40)
wishing pieces are if you're not playing (17:36 - 17:42)
every day (17:40 - 17:44)
and you're not you're not collecting (17:42 - 17:46)
watts (17:44 - 17:48)
you might not have like an inventory of (17:46 - 17:51)
like 500 wishing pieces just sitting (17:48 - 17:52)
and now that i'm like low on wishing (17:51 - 17:54)
pieces i know that like they're probably (17:52 - 17:56)
going to do an event for december (17:54 - 17:58)
so i'm going to check all my right dens (17:56 - 17:59)
every day (17:58 - 18:02)
i'm going to visit digging paw and i'm (17:59 - 18:03)
going to stock up on (18:02 - 18:05)
watts to get more wishing pieces so when (18:03 - 18:07)
december comes (18:05 - 18:10)
i'm not wasting time grinding watts i'm (18:07 - 18:11)
just (18:10 - 18:14)
wasting time throwing wishing pieces in (18:11 - 18:15)
a hole (18:14 - 18:18)
uh for whatever thing pops up assuming (18:15 - 18:19)
there is a december event (18:18 - 18:22)
i found joe's tweet it was actually not (18:19 - 18:25)
serebii it was joe's personal account (18:22 - 18:27)
uh the catch rate of the shiny squad is (18:25 - 18:29)
hosting guaranteed (18:27 - 18:32)
joining lowest chance yeah i (18:29 - 18:35)
have did did it say shiny squibbit (18:32 - 18:37)
uh shiny squibby okay yeah cause if it (18:35 - 18:39)
was a five star (18:37 - 18:41)
regular squabbit and your host it was (18:39 - 18:42)
not guaranteed catch right but he did (18:41 - 18:44)
say shawnee okay (18:42 - 18:45)
yeah he said the catch rate of the shiny (18:44 - 18:48)
squeal of it hosting guaranteed joining (18:45 - 18:50)
lowest chance the lowest chance like (18:48 - 18:52)
legendary (18:50 - 18:57)
like you left that on one percent (18:52 - 19:00)
i mean it can't have been that low or i (18:57 - 19:02)
was very lucky because i did not do that (19:00 - 19:04)
that many shiny dens (19:02 - 19:08)
in all and told and i have i would say (19:04 - 19:11)
i would say i got in 10 shiny dens and i (19:08 - 19:12)
caught three (19:11 - 19:15)
that's not terrible not terrible it's (19:12 - 19:16)
not squibbit (19:15 - 19:17)
not typical squabbit catch right but (19:16 - 19:20)
it's not terrible but it's also (19:17 - 19:22)
also i never found a shiny den in my (19:20 - 19:23)
game this entire weekend (19:22 - 19:27)
doing it myself i found one (19:23 - 19:29)
yeah i found one myself and i did about (19:27 - 19:31)
200 wishing pieces (19:29 - 19:34)
that's a lot of wishing pieces yeah it (19:31 - 19:35)
is well i mean i found a lot of five (19:34 - 19:37)
star squibbets (19:35 - 19:39)
it's just the only one which i didn't (19:37 - 19:42)
only never find anything that were shiny (19:39 - 19:44)
so ironically my very first five star (19:42 - 19:46)
swell it was the shiny one and then i (19:44 - 19:46)
didn't find anything (19:46 - 19:50)
so wow keep it coming back yeah i (19:46 - 19:54)
used my luck up right away this is off (19:50 - 19:57)

among us in the most popular category (21:29 - 21:36)
this uh this author is very very uh (21:32 - 21:38)
set on the other three not having a (21:36 - 21:40)
chance here (21:38 - 21:42)
i mean i've just gotten into gungeon (21:40 - 21:45)
impact which is dangerous (21:42 - 21:48)
yeah i saw an ad for that and thought i (21:45 - 21:49)
think you had mentioned it a couple (21:48 - 21:50)
podcasts ago so i immediately thought of (21:49 - 21:51)
you (21:50 - 21:54)
yeah i was finally convinced (21:51 - 21:56)
i was finally convinced to download it (21:54 - 21:58)
and it is (21:56 - 22:00)
very very very pretty yeah that's that's (21:58 - 22:02)
the number one danger sign of me playing (22:00 - 22:04)
a game (22:02 - 22:06)
just goes in and describes all the games (22:04 - 22:07)
uh genji (22:06 - 22:11)
impact is a gotcha game uh legends of (22:07 - 22:12)
runeterra (22:11 - 22:14)
is a free-to-play digital collectible (22:12 - 22:16)
card game (22:14 - 22:20)
made by riot and then cafe mix is (22:16 - 22:21)
the game that i refuse to play because i (22:20 - 22:24)
don't want to turn my phone sideways (22:21 - 22:27)
you are yeah that's uh (22:24 - 22:30)
just the worst reason to not play a game (22:27 - 22:34)
honestly i mean it really is it's so (22:30 - 22:38)
it makes zero sense also like your palm (22:34 - 22:39)
kind of covers the speaker (22:38 - 22:41)
on the iphone at least how are you (22:39 - 22:42)
holding your phone (22:41 - 22:44)
your palm cups it and makes the speaker (22:42 - 22:45)
point the sound at you (22:44 - 22:48)
no i would say my phone is my hand right (22:45 - 22:49)
now i would say that (22:48 - 22:53)
the uh what's the like (22:49 - 22:55)
the thing about right below your index (22:53 - 22:56)
finger that's like (22:55 - 22:58)
that for me overlaps the speaker because (22:56 - 22:59)
i want to put my (22:58 - 23:02)
index fingers to wrap around the top of (22:59 - 23:04)
the phone (23:02 - 23:05)
i want to hold it like a playstation (23:04 - 23:08)
controller (23:05 - 23:10)
don't understand how you're holding your (23:08 - 23:12)
phone well i can't take a picture of me (23:10 - 23:14)
holding my phone when i'm holding the (23:12 - 23:16)
phone i need another phone to do that (23:14 - 23:20)
well get irene in all right (23:16 - 23:23)

holding the phone and then send it to (23:23 - 23:26)
you (23:25 - 23:28)
thank you so what i'm gathering here and (23:26 - 23:30)
take it back to a line from apple is (23:28 - 23:32)
that you're just holding the phone wrong (23:30 - 23:34)
yeah yeah probably and then you use like (23:32 - 23:36)
your middle fingers to like put it (23:34 - 23:36)
behind (23:36 - 23:40)
the phone for like stability (23:36 - 23:43)
what do we have the same fingers yeah (23:40 - 23:44)

they said okay these people are on the (25:03 - 25:06)
advisory boards and their games are up (25:04 - 25:08)
for awards this is a conflict of (25:06 - 25:10)
interest i'm calling ethics violations (25:08 - 25:12)
on this whole thing (25:10 - 25:14)
uh yeah i mean he's been doing this for (25:12 - 25:16)
what like eight years now (25:14 - 25:20)
he said 2014 right yeah that's six years (25:16 - 25:21)
oh yeah six years i don't know why i (25:20 - 25:25)
thought it was in my mind it's 20 22. (25:21 - 25:29)
and everything (25:25 - 25:31)
except for how you hold your phone yeah (25:29 - 25:33)
clearly (25:31 - 25:33)
clearly not that it's uh yeah i (25:35 - 25:40)
i feel like cafe mix was like we just (25:38 - 25:42)
need to throw something up here (25:40 - 25:45)
maybe is cafe mix actually that good i (25:42 - 25:47)
think cafe mix is that popular (25:45 - 25:48)
i i mean when i when i was playing it (25:47 - 25:50)
regularly it was very fun (25:48 - 25:52)
it's a fun puzzle game and it's very (25:50 - 25:53)
cute like (25:52 - 25:56)
if you take the two seconds to turn your (25:53 - 25:58)
phone the right way (25:56 - 26:00)
which the game does automatically for (25:58 - 26:02)
you you just actually need to physically (26:00 - 26:04)
move your hand for (26:02 - 26:06)
approximately half a second to get it in (26:04 - 26:08)
the right position (26:06 - 26:10)
you would see that the game is kind of (26:08 - 26:11)

seen your trips (26:47 - 26:52)
i love trims this is off uh (26:48 - 26:53)
spencer sent this in the stuff that (26:52 - 26:55)
while pokemon masters tweeted it and (26:53 - 26:56)
it's on their instagram (26:55 - 26:59)
uh i'll just sum it up real quick they (26:56 - 27:00)
showed a trailer (26:59 - 27:04)
sword and shield people are coming (27:00 - 27:08)
two pokemon shield is coming to pokemon (27:04 - 27:09)
masters (27:08 - 27:10)
that's exciting right it breathes a (27:09 - 27:12)
little life into the game yeah (27:10 - 27:13)
you guys were worried a little bit about (27:12 - 27:15)
it well weeks ago well (27:13 - 27:17)
adding new characters doesn't i wouldn't (27:15 - 27:19)
say breathe life into the game it (27:17 - 27:22)
breathes money into the game well that's (27:19 - 27:26)
money equals life in mobile game worlds (27:22 - 27:29)
uh a lot of the comments i'm reading are (27:26 - 27:30)
people thinking it's gloria (27:29 - 27:33)
and based on like there's a howl (27:30 - 27:35)
in the trailer i'm really bad at like (27:33 - 27:37)
any time there's like audio hints in a (27:35 - 27:39)
trailer i can never hear them (27:37 - 27:41)
i haven't you got the speaker of your (27:39 - 27:42)
phone covered with your hands (27:41 - 27:44)
that's true yeah that's that's why i (27:42 - 27:45)
always have to keep it vertical because (27:44 - 27:46)
my ears are sensitive (27:45 - 27:48)
i can't remember if people were saying (27:46 - 27:50)
it was amazing or zashian (27:48 - 27:53)
but i guess like if they're doing gloria (27:50 - 27:55)
and victor i guess they're probably (27:53 - 27:56)
gonna give them (27:55 - 28:00)
zamasa tanzashian which is weird because (27:56 - 28:01)
like who are they giving the starters to (28:00 - 28:03)
if they decide to do that (28:01 - 28:05)
because hop wouldn't get a starter hop (28:03 - 28:07)
would get double (28:05 - 28:11)
yeah well yeah you're right i don't know (28:07 - 28:13)
yeah i don't know i mean i can hear i (28:11 - 28:15)
played the thing and i can hear the howl (28:13 - 28:17)
i don't know which howl that is other (28:15 - 28:18)
howls different yeah their halls are (28:17 - 28:19)
different (28:18 - 28:22)
is there youtube about the house is (28:19 - 28:24)
there owl (28:22 - 28:28)
sure there is probably (28:24 - 28:28)
and gloria is the is the female avatar (28:29 - 28:35)
right yeah she's the female protagonist (28:32 - 28:36)
well who do they usually give the (28:35 - 28:39)
starters to the protagonist yeah usually (28:36 - 28:42)
yeah like lyra has the chikorita and (28:39 - 28:42)
then (28:42 - 28:47)
ethan has cyndaquil and then um (28:42 - 28:49)
brendan has trico right yeah brendan has (28:47 - 28:50)
strico (28:49 - 28:52)
chris has total dial somebody has told (28:50 - 28:53)
how chris does (28:52 - 28:56)
chris that's so dial and you know red (28:53 - 28:57)
blue and green have all the starters (28:56 - 29:00)
right right okay whether or not they (28:57 - 29:02)
bring (29:00 - 29:05)
gen eight trainers to (29:02 - 29:07)
pokemon masters their people will (29:05 - 29:09)
continue to be upset that (29:07 - 29:11)
deanthe is still not in the game which i (29:09 - 29:12)
don't understand (29:11 - 29:14)

bad she is so good she's one of the best (29:15 - 29:22)
champions she has (29:19 - 29:25)
patrat has more character development oh (29:22 - 29:26)

bryson man bryson has (30:42 - 30:49)
he he is even courteous enough to take (30:45 - 30:51)
you on set (30:49 - 30:55)
deantha doesn't show me where she works (30:51 - 30:57)

bryson then went and told deanthe like (31:13 - 31:15)
yeah (31:14 - 31:17)
don't don't take that guy to your cool (31:15 - 31:18)

worst experience of his life (31:22 - 31:26)

lysander in the cafe when you first (31:52 - 31:56)
arrive to (31:55 - 31:59)
lumios but i don't remember the second (31:56 - 32:00)
time she (31:59 - 32:03)

or sorry thursday thursday evening to (34:17 - 34:22)
continue adapting to the changing global (34:20 - 34:24)
environment and response to the (34:22 - 34:25)
situation becoming more difficult (34:24 - 34:27)
for many of our players we are returning (34:25 - 34:29)
the following bonus beginning thursday (34:27 - 34:30)
november 19th (34:29 - 34:34)
increased effectiveness of uh in incense (34:30 - 34:37)
effectiveness will be increased now (34:34 - 34:39)
attracting pokemon to you more often (34:37 - 34:41)
your buddy will now bring you more gifts (34:39 - 34:42)
each day up to five game (34:41 - 34:46)
gifts at once up to three times a day (34:42 - 34:48)
i don't know what's happening in here (34:46 - 34:50)
maybe you're maybe you've paid attention (34:48 - 34:52)
to your buddy greg (34:50 - 34:56)
he's my best buddy we play every day (34:52 - 34:58)
i just got a sticker on stabilized (34:56 - 35:00)
forehead which is the weirdest place to (34:58 - 35:01)
have him to put it but (35:00 - 35:03)
whatever yeah there it is oh the ribbon (35:01 - 35:04)
yeah it's on his head (35:03 - 35:06)
yes that's what they did with the box (35:04 - 35:08)
fly they just slapped it on his head and (35:06 - 35:08)
i was like (35:08 - 35:11)
i'm i'm into this farfetch'd has it (35:08 - 35:13)
probably on his chest (35:11 - 35:14)
everything else has another chest except (35:13 - 35:17)
for stabilize like oink (35:14 - 35:19)
these bonuses are temporary but they (35:17 - 35:20)
will remain (35:19 - 35:24)
in the game through at minimum (35:20 - 35:28)
through june of 2021 and we will give at (35:24 - 35:28)
least (35:28 - 35:31)
one month's notice before they change (35:28 - 35:31)
monday (35:31 - 35:35)
they're changing that's uh (35:31 - 35:38)
that's good that's better than the i (35:35 - 35:39)
don't know what was (35:38 - 35:40)
maybe 24 hour notice that we had that (35:39 - 35:42)
they were going away last time (35:40 - 35:45)
so that's nice when we covered the news (35:42 - 35:46)
of them (35:45 - 35:49)
removing those two bonuses uh was like (35:46 - 35:51)
exactly a month ago (35:49 - 35:54)
yes that sounds about right was it only (35:51 - 35:55)
been a month really that those bonuses (35:54 - 35:57)
was it only this month that the bonuses (35:55 - 35:58)
were gone (35:57 - 36:01)
no i think they went in two months worth (35:58 - 36:01)
right (36:01 - 36:04)
okay yeah i think in september uh yes (36:01 - 36:06)
because they updated the original (36:04 - 36:07)
article so if i (36:06 - 36:10)
if i go to the url it says 2020 0 (36:07 - 36:13)
9 29 so a little over a month (36:10 - 36:16)
so only october yeah so that was they (36:13 - 36:17)
would oh yeah (36:16 - 36:19)
most of december i mean it was a month (36:17 - 36:21)
oh and most of november month and a half (36:19 - 36:23)
yeah right right yeah i forgot what (36:21 - 36:24)
month we were in (36:23 - 36:27)
i i thought it was 20 22 about 20 (36:24 - 36:29)
minutes ago (36:27 - 36:29)
yeah well i haven't left my house in (36:30 - 36:33)
like eight months so everything looks (36:31 - 36:34)
the same (36:33 - 36:36)
oh wait i moved a month ago but other (36:34 - 36:37)
than that (36:36 - 36:40)
i totally left myself completely picking (36:37 - 36:41)
up everything and moving it to a (36:40 - 36:45)
different house i haven't left the house (36:41 - 36:45)
i i still stand by that (36:48 - 36:54)
niantic gets so much flack for this kind (36:52 - 36:55)
of stuff but (36:54 - 36:57)
no one ever blames like the pokemon (36:55 - 36:59)
company well (36:57 - 37:01)
if niantic was to be like hey we're (36:59 - 37:02)
gonna remove the (37:01 - 37:04)
if like september 30th or whatever they (37:02 - 37:06)
were like we're gonna remove the incense (37:04 - 37:07)
and (37:06 - 37:09)
what was the other thing the buddy stuff (37:07 - 37:11)
and the pokemon company didn't step in (37:09 - 37:12)
and say like (37:11 - 37:15)
no don't do that to our players our own (37:12 - 37:16)
customers that (37:15 - 37:19)
can also probably buy merch and (37:16 - 37:20)
watch the anime and we don't want to (37:19 - 37:22)
make like what is happening between (37:20 - 37:24)
these two companies (37:22 - 37:26)
where it took them 45 days to be like (37:24 - 37:30)
you know that decision was bad (37:26 - 37:30)
like is it actually just like a (37:31 - 37:34)
translation barrier (37:32 - 37:36)
is it just because everyone's working at (37:34 - 37:37)
home and they like (37:36 - 37:38)
send an email and no one checks that (37:37 - 37:40)
email for like two weeks like (37:38 - 37:45)
why like i would i would maybe bet (37:40 - 37:46)
if if the pokemon company was an (37:45 - 37:48)
american company (37:46 - 37:50)
we wouldn't have to wait so long for (37:48 - 37:51)
simple changes to happen (37:50 - 37:55)
but maybe maybe i don't know maybe (37:51 - 37:58)
maybe we would i think because they have (37:55 - 37:59)
to look at it on (37:58 - 38:02)
a global perspective and make a decision (37:59 - 38:04)
that's for everybody so (38:02 - 38:06)
i guarantee you that niantic has to make (38:04 - 38:07)
the decision (38:06 - 38:09)
looking at their global numbers run the (38:07 - 38:11)
numbers then send it to the pokemon (38:09 - 38:12)
company (38:11 - 38:13)
and then they're going to check (38:12 - 38:16)
everything again and then send it back (38:13 - 38:18)
like there's no way that's happening in (38:16 - 38:19)
under three weeks (38:18 - 38:21)
yeah i mean yeah you're looking at like (38:19 - 38:23)
i mean they're looking at month-end (38:21 - 38:24)
numbers right (38:23 - 38:26)
right uh you know i can tell you as an (38:24 - 38:27)
accountant (38:26 - 38:29)
like it takes time to like get those (38:27 - 38:30)
official i mean you're not just you (38:29 - 38:32)
don't want to just throw (38:30 - 38:34)
estimates at them and be like well this (38:32 - 38:35)
was this or this did that (38:34 - 38:39)
and so i mean i could see it being like (38:35 - 38:39)
a month (38:39 - 38:42)
to realize like oh this just we took a (38:39 - 38:43)
hit because of this (38:42 - 38:45)
um i don't know i mean if you look at (38:43 - 38:48)
the how the world is doing right now i (38:45 - 38:49)
guess you don't need a month to look at (38:48 - 38:50)
that and be like (38:49 - 38:51)
maybe we should put those bonuses back (38:50 - 38:53)
in the game yeah but (38:51 - 38:55)
uh i mean i mean i would have argued (38:53 - 38:57)
they shouldn't have made the decision in (38:55 - 38:57)
the first place (38:57 - 39:00)
like when they cut it off the trend was (38:57 - 39:01)
really bad (39:00 - 39:03)
but if it took them 45 days to get to (39:01 - 39:04)
this point (39:03 - 39:06)
does that mean it took them 45 days to (39:04 - 39:07)
decide hey let's start (39:06 - 39:10)
removing so if they get a bonus on (39:07 - 39:12)
october 1st that means they would have (39:10 - 39:13)
started talking about it (39:12 - 39:15)
but things were a lot better yep which (39:13 - 39:17)
would have been like july (39:15 - 39:19)
wait august like august 15th because (39:17 - 39:20)
august 15th (39:19 - 39:23)
yeah and august it was looking better (39:20 - 39:23)
yeah for sure (39:23 - 39:25)
it was probably even before that to be (39:23 - 39:26)
honest because (39:25 - 39:28)
that to pla planning to like remove a (39:26 - 39:30)
feature like that (39:28 - 39:32)
i don't think that has to do so much (39:30 - 39:33)
with um like (39:32 - 39:35)
it's not as monetary as i think they (39:33 - 39:36)
were just like well we want to get the (39:35 - 39:38)
game kind of back to (39:36 - 39:40)
to where it was before that was probably (39:38 - 39:42)
a decision made a while ago (39:40 - 39:46)
as they saw the the pandemic kind of (39:42 - 39:48)
not being as bad as it was in like march (39:46 - 39:49)
april but (39:48 - 39:51)
it was still i don't know it's never (39:49 - 39:52)
been like good uh (39:51 - 39:56)
but i think that that decision was made (39:52 - 40:00)
quite a while ago and then immediately (39:56 - 40:01)
when that had when that happened and (40:00 - 40:03)
they got all the backlash (40:01 - 40:06)
uh they were like oops we need to look (40:03 - 40:07)
into reversing this (40:06 - 40:09)
the only other thing that i can think of (40:07 - 40:11)
of like why this took (40:09 - 40:15)
so long to re-vert that's the right word (40:11 - 40:17)
is because they were arguing of like (40:15 - 40:18)
well well (40:17 - 40:20)
what are we doing in the future and if (40:18 - 40:22)
the argument was (40:20 - 40:24)
a bunch of people in a boardroom or on a (40:22 - 40:26)
zoom call saying (40:24 - 40:28)
well let's revisit it in march and then (40:26 - 40:30)
be somebody be like no let's do april (40:28 - 40:31)
and then finally i guess they decided (40:30 - 40:32)
june (40:31 - 40:34)
which is i feel extremely generous but (40:32 - 40:36)
maybe not (40:34 - 40:38)
but saying that the bonuses will remain (40:36 - 40:42)
in the game minimum through june of 2021 (40:38 - 40:44)
it doesn't seem like a light decision it (40:42 - 40:46)
seems like there was probably (40:44 - 40:49)
some back and forth probably but i think (40:46 - 40:51)
there's a few things that could lead to (40:49 - 40:53)
a decision like that one being (40:51 - 40:56)
um the i don't think that they're losing (40:53 - 40:58)
a whole i mean they're probably making (40:56 - 40:59)
more money right they're making more (40:58 - 41:01)
money with these things being in game (40:59 - 41:02)
the way they are i mean people are (41:01 - 41:04)
buying more incense because they (41:02 - 41:07)
are getting because it's so much better (41:04 - 41:08)
um (41:07 - 41:10)
and to be fair uh when they did remove (41:08 - 41:12)
the bonus you know they didn't say it (41:10 - 41:13)
but like it was (41:12 - 41:15)
it didn't remove it back to five minutes (41:13 - 41:16)
for every spawn it was like 90 seconds (41:15 - 41:18)
per spawn (41:16 - 41:20)
right so like even sitting on my couch i (41:18 - 41:21)
was still getting (41:20 - 41:23)
a spawn every 90 seconds and that was a (41:21 - 41:24)
nice little surprise after being you (41:23 - 41:26)
know it was a little roller coaster of (41:24 - 41:27)
emotion of like (41:26 - 41:29)
oh i took these bonuses away i'm so (41:27 - 41:31)
bummed and then like oh well (41:29 - 41:33)
it's not that bad it you know every 90 (41:31 - 41:34)
seconds and (41:33 - 41:36)
you know how to fix that clear (41:34 - 41:37)
communication (41:36 - 41:38)
okay so that was that's the thing i (41:37 - 41:40)
think the biggest thing isn't (41:38 - 41:42)
removing features or whether what are (41:40 - 41:43)
they doing with features it's the (41:42 - 41:45)
communication of it all so (41:43 - 41:47)
if like they said now they're gonna give (41:45 - 41:49)
a month's notice before they decide to (41:47 - 41:50)
take this away (41:49 - 41:52)
that was great that would be really (41:50 - 41:54)
great to have a month's notice to be (41:52 - 41:56)
okay in a month these things are going (41:54 - 41:57)
to revert (41:56 - 42:00)
and now we're ready for it versus 24 (41:57 - 42:01)
hours when i may have (42:00 - 42:03)
bought a bunch of incense in the last (42:01 - 42:05)
day because i'm thinking oh i'm gonna (42:03 - 42:07)
buy some incense for the next week or (42:05 - 42:08)
whatever right like (42:07 - 42:11)
a month is a good amount of time to know (42:08 - 42:13)
something's gonna go away (42:11 - 42:16)
also i think that a time frame like june (42:13 - 42:18)
i don't remember if the data was out yet (42:16 - 42:19)
already when this (42:18 - 42:21)
when this decision was made but like i (42:19 - 42:23)
mean that's kind of an idea of like (42:21 - 42:27)
vaccine for stuff for the pandemic (42:23 - 42:28)
but like it's widely going to be (42:27 - 42:30)
potentially available so maybe there was (42:28 - 42:31)
ideas of like (42:30 - 42:33)
that might be a safe bet is to like go (42:31 - 42:36)
middle of next year oh i was thinking (42:33 - 42:40)
july is their big month (42:36 - 42:43)
so we roll back all the changes in june (42:40 - 42:44)
yeah but i don't i don't know if it (42:43 - 42:47)
makes a whole lot of sense from a (42:44 - 42:48)
standpoint like from that standpoint to (42:47 - 42:51)
roll everything back because i feel like (42:48 - 42:52)
rolling everything back in june when (42:51 - 42:54)
july's your big month you're betting (42:52 - 42:54)
that like (42:54 - 42:56)
all of a sudden everyone's gonna be like (42:54 - 42:57)
okay now we're all just gonna go outside (42:56 - 43:00)
yeah well they are making bad bets for (42:57 - 43:01)
sure (43:00 - 43:04)
yeah do you think that like (43:01 - 43:08)
we get go fest in july i think we get (43:04 - 43:10)
some kind of in-person one maybe (43:08 - 43:12)
definitely a virtual one (43:10 - 43:16)
i can see in person one i can see a go (43:12 - 43:17)
fest in person just because (43:16 - 43:20)
it's outside as a verse versus like a (43:17 - 43:21)
pax (43:20 - 43:25)
or an e3 which is like indoors (43:21 - 43:28)
right i think that it also depends just (43:25 - 43:29)
where we are (43:28 - 43:32)
i heard a sigh from greg i just (43:29 - 43:35)
the problem is it would be outdoors but (43:32 - 43:36)
the oh like (43:35 - 43:39)
if things aren't going to change you (43:36 - 43:39)
can't (43:39 - 43:42)
have it be hours and hours and hours (43:39 - 43:43)
right (43:42 - 43:46)
so you can probably safely get away with (43:43 - 43:46)
an (43:46 - 43:48)
hour outdoors but you still have to (43:46 - 43:50)
limit the amount of people there like oh (43:48 - 43:51)
yeah yeah (43:50 - 43:54)
everything that's here i mean to be fair (43:51 - 43:57)
when we were at go fest in chicago (43:54 - 43:59)
it was pretty easy not to be by anyone (43:57 - 44:00)
yeah (43:59 - 44:01)
yeah so if they were to pick the same (44:00 - 44:03)
location until you went over to the (44:01 - 44:04)
trade area and they're all (44:03 - 44:07)
okay yeah so yes the trade area and the (44:04 - 44:09)
spooky area was probably the biggest but (44:07 - 44:11)
there was in the middle there was that (44:09 - 44:13)
like swamp land in between the trade (44:11 - 44:14)
area (44:13 - 44:16)
and the friends where it was like all (44:14 - 44:18)
muddy and gray where like no one was but (44:16 - 44:19)
nobody like (44:18 - 44:22)
trudged through it to get to the um but (44:19 - 44:23)
they could pick an (44:22 - 44:26)
area that big and they could literally (44:23 - 44:27)
just invite (44:26 - 44:29)
half the amount of people and you would (44:27 - 44:31)
have probably 20 feet around you at all (44:29 - 44:32)
times i mean (44:31 - 44:33)
obviously unless you're playing with (44:32 - 44:35)
your own friend group which is the same (44:33 - 44:36)
situation (44:35 - 44:38)
on the plane which is don't sit by (44:36 - 44:39)
anyone (44:38 - 44:42)
unless they're your friends or family (44:39 - 44:43)
that you are traveling with then you are (44:42 - 44:45)
allowed to sit in the center seat if not (44:43 - 44:46)
you are not allowed to sit in the center (44:45 - 44:47)
seat (44:46 - 44:51)
it's just still not whatever yeah (44:47 - 44:53)
there's a lot of compromises to all of (44:51 - 44:54)
this um (44:53 - 44:57)
i mean i think it's hopeful to say that (44:54 - 44:59)
they'll be able to have an (44:57 - 45:02)
outdoor event july of next year (44:59 - 45:07)
i think that is the absolute best case (45:02 - 45:09)
everything goes right over these next (45:07 - 45:10)
six (45:09 - 45:12)
months for that to happen and that's (45:10 - 45:15)
definitely trended well in 2020 huh (45:12 - 45:18)
yeah i mean we have to sort of be honest (45:15 - 45:21)
as to what the vaccine is right (45:18 - 45:24)
how quickly it can be produced and the (45:21 - 45:26)
fact that the general public (45:24 - 45:28)
won't even begin to see the first hint (45:26 - 45:30)
of it until may of next year (45:28 - 45:32)
right exactly like unless there's some (45:30 - 45:35)
major like a million things go right (45:32 - 45:36)
between now and then (45:35 - 45:39)
that is that is a far off hope that (45:36 - 45:40)
they'll be able to have an in-person (45:39 - 45:41)
event next year (45:40 - 45:44)
so similar to a lot of things that (45:41 - 45:46)
happened are happening currently (45:44 - 45:49)
do i think they should have an event in (45:46 - 45:50)
person no (45:49 - 45:51)
do i think they will have an event in (45:50 - 45:55)
person probably (45:51 - 45:55)
so well they had to cancel the (45:55 - 46:00)
kyoto event which they they tweeted (45:58 - 46:01)
about i think (46:00 - 46:04)
niantic support tweeted about i mean the (46:01 - 46:04)
official (46:04 - 46:08)
japanese pokemon go tweeted that i don't (46:04 - 46:10)
really probably no reason for the (46:08 - 46:11)
american pokemon go to tweet hey this (46:10 - 46:14)
japanese effect is cancelled (46:11 - 46:16)
was that the city tour one that was the (46:14 - 46:18)
city tour one so (46:16 - 46:20)
there was four city tours we talked (46:18 - 46:23)
about those last week the taiwan (46:20 - 46:27)
um auckland the kyoto (46:23 - 46:28)
and then i can't remember the last one (46:27 - 46:30)
but the kyoto one got cancelled (46:28 - 46:34)
i want to say japan had 500 cases in a (46:30 - 46:35)
single day which is the highest it's (46:34 - 46:37)
been since (46:35 - 46:41)
i want to june or maybe yeah they spiked (46:37 - 46:46)
um on the 19th which is (46:41 - 46:48)
and it just keep it just keep it getting (46:46 - 46:50)
worse like they had been weighed down in (46:48 - 46:52)
over the summer but again everywhere had (46:50 - 46:53)
been way down (46:52 - 46:56)
over the summer months so like (46:53 - 46:57)
in the southern hemisphere where they're (46:56 - 46:59)
hitting summer they will i'll probably (46:57 - 47:01)
be fine right well you've got like new (46:59 - 47:02)
zealand where (47:01 - 47:04)
auckland where there's no cases or very (47:02 - 47:07)
like very very digit cases (47:04 - 47:09)
but they are very like they do things (47:07 - 47:11)
that nobody else in the world is doing (47:09 - 47:11)
so (47:11 - 47:13)
right no absolutely but again this goes (47:11 - 47:15)
back to (47:13 - 47:17)
the pokemon company has to approve these (47:15 - 47:18)
decisions (47:17 - 47:20)
if if niantic was like hey we want to do (47:18 - 47:22)
four city events in four cities that (47:20 - 47:24)
seem relatively safe one of the cities (47:22 - 47:26)
being like (47:24 - 47:29)
uh in japan and the pokemon company says (47:26 - 47:31)
yes we approve these cities (47:29 - 47:34)
they're at a base level i mean they're (47:31 - 47:35)
agreeing (47:34 - 47:38)
to let niantic do this yeah (47:35 - 47:42)
so if they're okay with doing smaller (47:38 - 47:45)
city events now when it's (47:42 - 47:49)
the worst it's been i just (47:45 - 47:51)
i'm not saying i agree with it i'm just (47:49 - 47:52)
it just seems very likely that (47:51 - 47:56)
they will definitely try tr they as (47:52 - 47:58)
the pokemon company and niantic try to (47:56 - 48:01)
do events i mean we already saw (47:58 - 48:02)
excluding niantic we've already saw the (48:01 - 48:04)
pokemon company tweet that they're (48:02 - 48:06)
trying to get the tcg back up in japan (48:04 - 48:09)
with the like the tcg glass shield (48:06 - 48:11)
things (48:09 - 48:13)
like the they look like you're like you (48:11 - 48:14)
went to prison (48:13 - 48:16)
and like you you're sitting one person's (48:14 - 48:18)
in jail the other person's not and (48:16 - 48:19)
you're like arguing about like who's (48:18 - 48:21)
getting the kids in the next weekend (48:19 - 48:25)
and and they've they've also rolled out (48:21 - 48:29)
like new rules for the tcg where like (48:25 - 48:30)
instead of your opponent cutting your (48:29 - 48:31)
deck they will (48:30 - 48:33)
they will like point at a thing of how (48:31 - 48:35)
many times they want you to cut it in (48:33 - 48:37)
front of them (48:35 - 48:39)
i mean i i think they'll try and most (48:37 - 48:41)
likely just like the kyoto event it will (48:39 - 48:42)
be cancelled (48:41 - 48:47)
yeah i don't know i mean i just (48:42 - 48:50)
don't i just don't think that in six (48:47 - 48:51)
more months (48:50 - 48:54)
it will be in control right at least in (48:51 - 48:55)
control enough to be (48:54 - 48:58)
having like a a massive event a massive (48:55 - 48:59)
i will say (48:58 - 49:01)
in six months it will be in control in (48:59 - 49:05)
every country but the united states (49:01 - 49:08)
also a somewhat safe well now (49:05 - 49:11)
we we can all point to sweden (49:08 - 49:12)
[Laughter] (49:11 - 49:16)
okay uh this is uh this is their their (49:12 - 49:17)
biggest update here (49:16 - 49:20)
this is what they say not me um (49:17 - 49:23)
not me don't even confuse that this is (49:20 - 49:24)
coming from me (49:23 - 49:27)
i would never say these things trainers (49:24 - 49:29)
since we began our journey together over (49:27 - 49:32)
four years ago pokemon go has evolved in (49:29 - 49:33)
many ways (49:32 - 49:34)
from the addition of battles raid (49:33 - 49:37)
battles trainer battles team rocket go (49:34 - 49:38)
but a team go rocket battles (49:37 - 49:41)
to the discovery of over 600 different (49:38 - 49:42)
pokemon that can be encountered in the (49:41 - 49:43)
game (49:42 - 49:46)
the world of pokemon go has changed and (49:43 - 49:48)
expanded in new ways (49:46 - 49:50)
the week of monday november 30th pokemon (49:48 - 49:51)
go will go (49:50 - 49:55)
beyond we'll be making changes (49:51 - 49:57)
to how trainers can level up and (49:55 - 49:59)
implementing seasons (49:57 - 50:03)
a new way to experience in-game events (49:59 - 50:05)
but not only that but pokemon originally (50:03 - 50:07)
discovered in the kalos region will be (50:05 - 50:10)
coming to pokemon go (50:07 - 50:12)
let's start with the the these are the (50:10 - 50:13)
three things the (50:12 - 50:16)
the level the level cap the seasons (50:13 - 50:17)
and the kalos pokemon let's just start (50:16 - 50:19)
with the callous pokemon because i don't (50:17 - 50:19)
think there's (50:19 - 50:22)
really a lot here starting uh wednesday (50:19 - 50:23)
december 2nd (50:22 - 50:25)
uh we'll be meeting pokemon first (50:23 - 50:26)
discovered in the region where (50:25 - 50:29)
dreams and adventures begin kalos i (50:26 - 50:29)
don't (50:29 - 50:32)
think that's true well uh (50:29 - 50:36)
with the a recent recent arrival of mega (50:32 - 50:39)
pokemon omega evolution of pokemon go it (50:36 - 50:40)
feels timely that pokemon originally (50:39 - 50:42)
discovered in the kalos region the (50:40 - 50:44)
region where mega evolution were first (50:42 - 50:45)
discovered will make (50:44 - 50:48)
their debut deck yeah sure (50:45 - 50:50)
okay i don't know the problem with this (50:48 - 50:53)
is like (50:50 - 50:53)
it's i don't know who to blame (50:53 - 50:58)
just this the state of how they have to (50:56 - 51:00)
like conduct their mobile game (50:58 - 51:04)
but it's like it's like five pokemon (51:00 - 51:08)
they said over 20 but like 20 are not (51:04 - 51:09)
appearing it's like (51:08 - 51:10)
five and then you have to evolve them so (51:09 - 51:12)
it's chest pain yeah (51:10 - 51:15)
it's it's seven okay (51:12 - 51:18)
all right yeah you're right it's seven (51:15 - 51:18)
chest pin (51:18 - 51:21)
fennekin froakie bunnelby fletchling lit (51:18 - 51:22)
leo (51:21 - 51:25)
and then klefki klefki will be biggersby (51:22 - 51:26)
though (51:25 - 51:29)
exclusive to france what um (51:26 - 51:32)
look let france have something (51:29 - 51:36)
no why why why do we have to let france (51:32 - 51:38)
have something i want a key (51:36 - 51:39)
we got the statue of liberty they got (51:38 - 51:41)
klefki (51:39 - 51:43)
they gave us the statue of liberty and (51:41 - 51:46)
we're giving them kluffke (51:43 - 51:49)
japan's giving them klemke you're right (51:46 - 51:51)
yes you're actually right japan probably (51:49 - 51:52)
made that decision (51:51 - 51:54)
it was probably masuda themself (51:52 - 51:56)
[Laughter] (51:54 - 51:59)
um they can have zucchini they also (51:56 - 52:02)
this is off uh i've also seen that (51:59 - 52:03)
there's like a (52:02 - 52:04)
there will be a raid exclusive pokemon (52:03 - 52:07)
we don't know what that is yet though (52:04 - 52:09)
so this will be like the shanks or the (52:07 - 52:12)
clink clink was the gen five one (52:09 - 52:15)
i think it'll be the scatter bug no way (52:12 - 52:15)
they put it (52:15 - 52:18)
no they would not put bug in there (52:15 - 52:20)
that's out that's a 7k (52:18 - 52:22)
egg if i ever heard one it's a one-star (52:20 - 52:23)
raid (52:22 - 52:26)
uh-huh it's (52:23 - 52:28)
gen 6 i mean they're doing all this (52:26 - 52:30)
trading stuff now (52:28 - 52:32)
like long distance trading something (52:30 - 52:34)
makes me feel like it's going to be (52:32 - 52:34)
scatterbug and then (52:34 - 52:37)
vivion's going to have a whole trade (52:34 - 52:38)
aspect to it (52:37 - 52:42)
yeah i i think there they did another (52:38 - 52:44)
trade thing this past weekend right this (52:42 - 52:46)
it's currently going on now (52:44 - 52:49)
until some until uh third yeah (52:46 - 52:51)
and now instead of it being like five (52:49 - 52:53)
miles it was like 30 miles or something (52:51 - 52:57)
uh 40 kilometers so i don't know (52:53 - 52:59)
put that in miles nobody knows what 4 (52:57 - 53:00)
miles or something but yeah (52:59 - 53:02)
40 kilometers seems to be about the (53:00 - 53:04)
distance uh (53:02 - 53:07)
that you can trade with someone yeah so (53:04 - 53:08)
i'm assuming they're eventually just (53:07 - 53:09)
gonna (53:08 - 53:11)
pull the trigger on this right and just (53:09 - 53:12)
do (53:11 - 53:15)
trade with anyone well they did mention (53:12 - 53:16)
in that article with the (53:15 - 53:20)
bonuses coming back uh they did mention (53:16 - 53:21)
that there are other bonuses that will (53:20 - 53:24)
be happening during events (53:21 - 53:27)
so trading for longer periods of longer (53:24 - 53:28)
distances will be (53:27 - 53:30)
coming back during events i know what's (53:28 - 53:31)
going into (53:30 - 53:35)
uh braids fur fruit and fur few (53:31 - 53:40)
perfume uh haircuts (53:35 - 53:40)
you have to collect all the haircuts i (53:40 - 53:46)
don't yeah i guess it could be scary (53:43 - 53:48)
you know they're going to do it they did (53:46 - 53:51)
all the different ones for deoxys (53:48 - 53:55)
they're going to make you hunt five star (53:51 - 53:58)
ratings (53:55 - 53:58)
yeah it won't be a one star because it's (53:58 - 54:01)
uh since it doesn't have any evolutions (54:00 - 54:02)
or anything (54:01 - 54:04)
but i really think it's going to be (54:02 - 54:05)
scatterbug i think (54:04 - 54:07)
that i just think that the the the (54:05 - 54:09)
testing of these long distance trading (54:07 - 54:11)
and this one star mystery egg during (54:09 - 54:13)
kayla's release (54:11 - 54:17)
and vivion being what it is just means (54:13 - 54:19)
i think it would be a if nothing else i (54:17 - 54:20)
think it would be really cool if they (54:19 - 54:22)
did it so (54:20 - 54:24)
so niantic if you're listening and (54:22 - 54:26)
you've already made plans change them (54:24 - 54:29)
and put scatterplot (54:26 - 54:29)
hey you've got you've got about 16 days (54:32 - 54:38)
you can er no not even you got about 10 (54:36 - 54:40)
days or 11 days before this (54:38 - 54:43)
happens um just other possibilities (54:40 - 54:46)
flow baby probably not skidoo pancham (54:43 - 54:49)
esper honage they could do homage i mean (54:46 - 54:50)
they put clink in and click (54:49 - 54:52)
is like very far in the pokedex and (54:50 - 54:55)
clink was like a unova (54:52 - 54:58)
debut right yep okay when looking at the (54:55 - 55:00)
article the the specific article for the (54:58 - 55:01)
kalos region (55:00 - 55:04)
not the main article they actually (55:01 - 55:07)
say about the mysterious raid egg that (55:04 - 55:08)
they're going to be tracking the (55:07 - 55:10)
progress of this egg on our social (55:08 - 55:11)
channels (55:10 - 55:13)
and we might need your help to get it to (55:11 - 55:15)
hatch sooner for fruit (55:13 - 55:16)
it's fur fruit and it's going to be on (55:15 - 55:19)
the haircut uh yeah i don't know (55:16 - 55:21)
scatterbugs just like for a hardcore (55:19 - 55:23)
player scatterbug makes sense and maybe (55:21 - 55:25)
i'm not saying that pokemon go fans (55:23 - 55:27)
aren't hardcore (55:25 - 55:30)
uh because they are in their own way but (55:27 - 55:30)
there's (55:30 - 55:34)
there there are people i would consider (55:30 - 55:36)
so i'm gonna word this carefully i would (55:34 - 55:38)
consider people who watch (55:36 - 55:40)
pokemon streams every day on twitch (55:38 - 55:41)
which is a small amount of people i (55:40 - 55:42)
would i would say they're pretty (55:41 - 55:43)
hardcore to the fact that they're (55:42 - 55:44)
literally watching (55:43 - 55:48)
pokemon content every day and so many of (55:44 - 55:48)
them (55:48 - 55:52)
don't know how vivian worked um and i i (55:48 - 55:53)
dedicated like two weeks to (55:52 - 55:55)
you know getting all the vivions through (55:53 - 55:58)
gts trading in pokemon home (55:55 - 56:00)
and the amount of times just it was kind (55:58 - 56:02)
of shocking how people just didn't know (56:00 - 56:03)
like (56:02 - 56:06)
vivion had 20 forms and like two forms (56:03 - 56:08)
were exclusive and you could only get (56:06 - 56:09)
forms by doing this and (56:08 - 56:12)
you can't breed it and stuff so if if it (56:09 - 56:14)
is vivian (56:12 - 56:15)
and niantic's already bad at (56:14 - 56:18)
communicating (56:15 - 56:18)
like i think it i think it's cool like (56:20 - 56:24)
it is it is obviously the (56:22 - 56:27)
the uh not the original but it is a (56:24 - 56:27)
pokemon (56:27 - 56:29)
no it is like the original region (56:27 - 56:31)
exclusive pokemon like it is (56:29 - 56:34)
exclusive to specific regions of a 3ds (56:31 - 56:37)
not exclusive to like whether your ds (56:34 - 56:38)
was (56:37 - 56:40)
a japanese game or a korean game or (56:38 - 56:42)
whatnot (56:40 - 56:45)
so if they if so i guess the balance is (56:42 - 56:46)
like (56:45 - 56:48)
we're four years into the game we're (56:46 - 56:50)
about to get (56:48 - 56:53)
eventually viviane but niantic has been (56:50 - 56:55)
doing testing for long distance trading (56:53 - 57:00)
but they've clearly wanted to protect (56:55 - 57:03)
region exclusive pokemon so (57:00 - 57:05)
are they protecting region exclusive (57:03 - 57:07)
pokemon or are they just giving up at (57:05 - 57:10)
this point and just doing trading (57:07 - 57:13)
well yeah but we're also seeing it with (57:10 - 57:13)
the (57:13 - 57:16)
lake trio already being (57:13 - 57:18)
yeah but the difference between vivian (57:16 - 57:20)
and lake trio's lake trios existed for (57:18 - 57:21)
like (57:20 - 57:23)
a year and a half and you know that (57:21 - 57:25)
they're not turning them shiny (57:23 - 57:27)
because people are going to freak out (57:25 - 57:29)
that they can finally get as elf and (57:27 - 57:32)
ooxy and mesprit and then in like six (57:29 - 57:34)
more months they'll be like we're doing (57:32 - 57:35)
it again but this time it's shiny (57:34 - 57:38)
because we want to double dip (57:35 - 57:40)
right right it's just to me vivian is (57:38 - 57:43)
too new for them to do that (57:40 - 57:46)
but the recent trades that they keep (57:43 - 57:47)
doing makes it seem like (57:46 - 57:50)
maybe they don't care as much anymore (57:47 - 57:50)
yeah (57:50 - 57:52)
it's like they're putting klefki in (57:50 - 57:54)
france so like they're still (57:52 - 57:56)
like i don't i don't know what they do (57:54 - 57:59)
they care do they not care i don't know (57:56 - 58:00)
yeah you're right i mean like maybe i (57:59 - 58:02)
mean again the trading is only 40 (58:00 - 58:03)
kilometers right (58:02 - 58:05)
it's not like it's worldwide trading so (58:03 - 58:07)
24 miles that's what i'm (58:05 - 58:08)
i'm not worried about it but i'm just (58:07 - 58:10)
thinking there's no (58:08 - 58:13)
actual technical limitation of 40 miles (58:10 - 58:14)
to unlimited they could just flip a (58:13 - 58:16)
switch (58:14 - 58:17)
no no but i'm saying like they can still (58:16 - 58:19)
care about regionals because like (58:17 - 58:21)
unless you've still traveled to that (58:19 - 58:22)
place like it's not like i can go (58:21 - 58:24)
trade someone in france right now for a (58:22 - 58:26)
klefki or when it comes out like (58:24 - 58:28)
it's still only 40 kilometers right so (58:26 - 58:30)
someone still has to have traveled there (58:28 - 58:32)
that is within 40 kilometers of me so i (58:30 - 58:34)
mean (58:32 - 58:37)
maybe maybe they hold off um (58:34 - 58:39)
on that but i don't know i mean i guess (58:37 - 58:41)
it also does say it's some mysterious (58:39 - 58:42)
pokemon (58:41 - 58:45)
uh scatterbug is not the most (58:42 - 58:52)
i mean they use this real loser (58:45 - 58:53)
i mean they're real loose with their (58:52 - 58:55)
definitions let's be real (58:53 - 58:58)
right uh yeah i don't know i mean (58:55 - 58:59)
there's a lot of theories out there (58:58 - 59:00)
it could be something that's not even (58:59 - 59:02)
kalos you know it could be something (59:00 - 59:03)
from (59:02 - 59:06)
an earlier gen but well let's let's move (59:03 - 59:08)
this conversation into (59:06 - 59:10)
seasons which i feel like no one is (59:08 - 59:11)
talking about (59:10 - 59:13)
because they did it in the game for one (59:11 - 59:16)
game and then promptly dumped it (59:13 - 59:19)
what no that literally has nothing to do (59:16 - 59:21)
with black and white (59:19 - 59:21)
i mean yeah sure black and white had (59:22 - 59:26)
seasons but like (59:24 - 59:29)
it in a in a game that takes place in (59:26 - 59:30)
real life (59:29 - 59:33)
that kind of had seasons before this (59:30 - 59:33)
like is (59:33 - 59:35)
it this actually makes sense that (59:33 - 59:37)
they're cementing it (59:35 - 59:40)
because they would be like well you can (59:37 - 59:40)
only (59:40 - 59:44)
get well i see feel all the time but i'm (59:40 - 59:44)
more (59:44 - 59:48)
like a wintery buy or a water icy biome (59:44 - 59:51)
but it would but this to me is exciting (59:48 - 59:53)
because (59:51 - 59:57)
it just makes more sense i guess (59:53 - 59:59)
to be like okay we're seeing wintry (59:57 - 60:01)
pokemon okay now we're seeing spring now (59:59 - 60:02)
we're seeing summer now we're seeing (60:01 - 60:04)
fall (60:02 - 60:06)
i think so i guess that's true i just (60:04 - 60:08)
thought that the weather system (60:06 - 60:11)
worked pretty well in how it what it did (60:08 - 60:12)
well they're not getting rid of the (60:11 - 60:14)
weather it'll still work with no i just (60:12 - 60:14)
don't know what (60:14 - 60:17)
they are improving with seasons that (60:14 - 60:19)
wasn't already done in weather (60:17 - 60:20)
right i think that what they're doing (60:19 - 60:23)
what (60:20 - 60:23)
i don't know are you going to you want (60:23 - 60:26)
to explain the article steve (60:24 - 60:28)
yeah so ideally what's happening is (60:26 - 60:30)
there's going to be two hemispheres (60:28 - 60:34)
a spoiler irl there (60:30 - 60:36)
i don't know if anyone taught you that (60:34 - 60:37)
um (60:36 - 60:40)
so seasons will be spoiler (60:37 - 60:42)
three months long because they're 12 (60:40 - 60:45)
months in a year (60:42 - 60:45)
um and different pokemon will appear in (60:45 - 60:49)
different seasons (60:48 - 60:52)
so for example the first season will (60:49 - 60:54)
start on december 1st and we'll go (60:52 - 60:58)
december january february and ideally (60:54 - 61:02)
those would be more uh well this is what (60:58 - 61:03)
they say (61:02 - 61:05)
here they say for example in the first (61:03 - 61:06)
season pokemon (61:05 - 61:09)
appearing in winter will be in the (61:06 - 61:10)
northern hemisphere while (61:09 - 61:13)
burmese dharamaka and other pokemon in (61:10 - 61:14)
the summer will be more (61:13 - 61:18)
in the southern hemisphere and i think (61:14 - 61:19)
what they can do (61:18 - 61:20)
and obviously they mentioned deerling (61:19 - 61:22)
because there's four (61:20 - 61:25)
forms of deerling per season and i think (61:22 - 61:26)
what they can do (61:25 - 61:28)
and what works in pokemon go in my (61:26 - 61:30)
opinion (61:28 - 61:33)
is that they can cut down there's (61:30 - 61:34)
there's 600 pokemon right and (61:33 - 61:36)
technically (61:34 - 61:38)
all of those pokemon can spawn with the (61:36 - 61:39)
exception of the pokemon they (61:38 - 61:40)
specifically (61:39 - 61:44)
turn off which as far as i know (61:40 - 61:46)
like yeah mask is turned off and like (61:44 - 61:48)
deliberate is turned off right (61:46 - 61:52)
yeah but like what about gen four and (61:48 - 61:53)
five (61:52 - 61:56)
uh like second level evolutions (61:53 - 61:59)
okay well they didn't turn those on yet (61:56 - 61:59)
but (61:59 - 62:02)
even if we oh god okay even if we don't (61:59 - 62:03)
count those (62:02 - 62:04)
even if you look at the first three (62:03 - 62:07)
which i'm pretty sure like (62:04 - 62:09)
sceptile can technically spawn in the (62:07 - 62:11)
wild even though i've never seen one (62:09 - 62:14)
yeah i got uh the other day i incense (62:11 - 62:15)
spawned an aggron (62:14 - 62:18)
oh that's a really cool thing yeah so (62:15 - 62:20)
you have you have all of these pokemon (62:18 - 62:20)
that (62:20 - 62:23)
exist and they technically all are (62:20 - 62:23)
spawning (62:23 - 62:26)
but the chance of you seeing like an (62:23 - 62:27)
agron (62:26 - 62:30)
is almost feels like almost impossible (62:27 - 62:33)
so with seasons they can be like well (62:30 - 62:36)
we have 200 pokemon were spawning in (62:33 - 62:37)
this season (62:36 - 62:40)
instead of 600 pokemon or even less they (62:37 - 62:43)
could maybe even say 100 or 150 (62:40 - 62:47)
and now instead of maybe getting like (62:43 - 62:48)
like if you open up your pokemon go (62:47 - 62:50)
right now it's probably like rattata (62:48 - 62:51)
zubat (62:50 - 62:53)
pidgey and purloin or something and it's (62:51 - 62:55)
like all garbage pokemon that you don't (62:53 - 62:56)
really care about (62:55 - 62:58)
i mean i don't know that season's (62:56 - 63:00)
changing that there's an event right now (62:58 - 63:03)
so but if if they could set it where (63:00 - 63:04)
like hey (63:03 - 63:07)
this month you're getting patrat next (63:04 - 63:09)
season you're only getting (63:07 - 63:10)
rattata the season after that you're (63:09 - 63:12)
only getting b-doof right (63:10 - 63:16)
they can at least cut down on the trash (63:12 - 63:16)
to be like (63:16 - 63:19)
well i'm only seeing this trash route (63:16 - 63:20)
one pokemon this (63:19 - 63:23)
for the next three months instead of (63:20 - 63:24)
rattata b (63:23 - 63:27)
doof patrat i think you're being uh (63:24 - 63:28)
really optimistic (63:27 - 63:30)
about what they're gonna cut out and (63:28 - 63:31)
what they're going to include (63:30 - 63:33)
i have a feeling all the trash is (63:31 - 63:34)
sticking around i don't think no matter (63:33 - 63:35)
what season it is i think that i think (63:34 - 63:37)
they fall into classifications (63:35 - 63:40)
and i think if they want i don't i mean (63:37 - 63:42)
there might be a small chance where like (63:40 - 63:45)
rattata isn't completely cut out but (63:42 - 63:45)
i've (63:45 - 63:47)
i i feel like if they're doing seasons (63:45 - 63:48)
they're just going to straight up cut (63:47 - 63:49)
pokemon because they've already done (63:48 - 63:50)
this with like yeah mask (63:49 - 63:53)
and deli bird and i mean i think they're (63:50 - 63:54)
going to cut pokemon but i don't think (63:53 - 63:55)
that they're going to cut the trash (63:54 - 63:58)
no i'm just saying gonna be around (63:55 - 63:59)
forever (63:58 - 64:02)
there's so much trash already in pokemon (63:59 - 64:04)
that they're just cutting the trash into (64:02 - 64:05)
four different segments (64:04 - 64:07)
like think of how much garbage like how (64:05 - 64:08)
many (64:07 - 64:10)
root one bug pokemon you see how many (64:08 - 64:11)
root one (64:10 - 64:13)
cat pokemon do you see how many route (64:11 - 64:15)
one rodent pokemon do you see there's (64:13 - 64:16)
just so (64:15 - 64:19)
much what's what season is rat it (64:16 - 64:19)
doesn't like (64:19 - 64:21)
that that that's the irrelevant part (64:19 - 64:23)
right like you can make patrat spawn (64:21 - 64:25)
literally in every season so just pick (64:23 - 64:26)
one to play yeah (64:25 - 64:28)
well i don't think they're gonna i don't (64:26 - 64:29)
think they're gonna pick one i think (64:28 - 64:30)
they're going to (64:29 - 64:33)
limit the ones that match seasons and (64:30 - 64:34)
still keep the trash (64:33 - 64:36)
i mean just based on what they're saying (64:34 - 64:40)
in the article it seems like that but (64:36 - 64:43)
i mean because like they're examples (64:40 - 64:44)
while burme and daramaka (64:43 - 64:47)
which don't appear already very much (64:44 - 64:49)
would only appear more in summer i (64:47 - 64:51)
i don't have a strong sense that they're (64:49 - 64:53)
gonna be like well b doof is (64:51 - 64:56)
a spring and rattata's a summer like (64:53 - 64:58)
i think those things are just the (64:56 - 65:00)
baseline (64:58 - 65:01)
this trash is always going to be getting (65:00 - 65:03)
that we've literally seen rattata for (65:01 - 65:05)
four years (65:03 - 65:07)
like that that is that is that is what (65:05 - 65:09)
they're fixing though that is why (65:07 - 65:10)
i don't think that's what they're fixing (65:09 - 65:11)
but they're they've already started (65:10 - 65:12)
doing that now (65:11 - 65:14)
right because they already talked about (65:12 - 65:16)
they how they've changed they've changed (65:14 - 65:17)
um (65:16 - 65:20)
spawns here and there and i mean (65:17 - 65:22)
i don't know that they would so you (65:20 - 65:24)
think they're just gonna like literally (65:22 - 65:26)
take like let's say it's a 600 pokemon (65:24 - 65:28)
you think they're going to take 150 of (65:26 - 65:29)
each and just throw them all into a (65:28 - 65:31)
specific season yes (65:29 - 65:33)
and then i will never like i will never (65:31 - 65:35)
see a rattata in fall if it's a spring (65:33 - 65:38)
pokemon yes i 100 believe that (65:35 - 65:40)
i don't think that's gonna happen i (65:38 - 65:41)
don't think this because you have to (65:40 - 65:43)
think about people who are (65:41 - 65:44)
you have to think about people who are (65:43 - 65:46)
new to the game as well okay trading and (65:44 - 65:49)
if okay wait you want delhi bird you (65:46 - 65:50)
gotta wait an entire year to get it or (65:49 - 65:51)
you trade it (65:50 - 65:53)
they've already but that's one that's (65:51 - 65:55)
one special pokemon that they made (65:53 - 65:56)
special when they released it to the for (65:55 - 65:57)
the first time yeah and they (65:56 - 66:00)
made pokemon like dratini special and (65:57 - 66:01)
marie special but now it's not special (66:00 - 66:02)
anymore but it (66:01 - 66:04)
and it doesn't even feel special when (66:02 - 66:05)
they bring it back because you just get (66:04 - 66:07)
the hardcore people complaining (66:05 - 66:08)
oh i see you stratini this event where (66:07 - 66:10)
are the bagons (66:08 - 66:13)
like there there is no winning to (66:10 - 66:16)
when a new player comes in and if a new (66:13 - 66:17)
player comes in and they're like oh man (66:16 - 66:19)
rat rattata isn't spawning for six (66:17 - 66:20)
months (66:19 - 66:21)
you can either be like here let me trade (66:20 - 66:23)
you a rat rachata and eradicate okay (66:21 - 66:25)
cool that was a hundred stardust all (66:23 - 66:26)
right you happy (66:25 - 66:29)
okay move on if they really wanted to (66:26 - 66:31)
you're the so not only could they cut (66:29 - 66:33)
rattata out for like nine months of the (66:31 - 66:35)
year and bring it back for only three (66:33 - 66:37)
months which i think they're going to do (66:35 - 66:39)
uh maybe maybe rattata's not like a good (66:37 - 66:41)
example maybe like because like rattata (66:39 - 66:43)
has like a specific metal to it (66:41 - 66:45)
so like maybe skiddy is a better example (66:43 - 66:47)
because kitty is trash (66:45 - 66:48)
well i mean i love skinny but it's like (66:47 - 66:50)
a trash spawn i mean skinny's already a (66:48 - 66:52)
rare spot this kitty is not a rare spawn (66:50 - 66:53)
i see (66:52 - 66:55)
i see like four skitties a day i see (66:53 - 66:57)
none really i don't see skitty ever (66:55 - 67:00)
i see skinny non-stop i would love to (66:57 - 67:02)
see so i mean this is because the (67:00 - 67:03)
question of what are they (67:02 - 67:05)
fixing with seasons that they don't (67:03 - 67:07)
already fix with weather and biome (67:05 - 67:09)
what do they what do they fix with (67:07 - 67:10)
seasons that they're not fixing with (67:09 - 67:12)
weather bio cutting pokemon that's (67:10 - 67:14)
literally what it does (67:12 - 67:15)
but i don't but based on based on the (67:14 - 67:17)
article literally saying (67:15 - 67:18)
in the first season you're going to see (67:17 - 67:20)
pokemon related to winter in the (67:18 - 67:21)
northern hemisphere (67:20 - 67:23)
and related to summer in the southern (67:21 - 67:25)
hemisphere literally saying (67:23 - 67:27)
that those pokemon are already related (67:25 - 67:29)
to winter and summer (67:27 - 67:31)
and so those pokemon you're mentioning (67:29 - 67:33)
aren't related to winter and summer (67:31 - 67:34)
they're not related to season at all (67:33 - 67:36)
yeah they're not related to a season (67:34 - 67:38)
whereas they're pointing out not every (67:36 - 67:40)
pokemon like like they're still going to (67:38 - 67:40)
be (67:40 - 67:42)
like exceptions to that like like that (67:40 - 67:43)
you (67:42 - 67:46)
like even in the games even if you were (67:43 - 67:46)
to go (67:46 - 67:48)
to black and white and it's like the (67:46 - 67:50)
winter season you're still going to see (67:48 - 67:53)
like abra or whatever in the grass like (67:50 - 67:53)
i wouldn't say (67:53 - 67:56)
abra is a winter pokemon but hey it just (67:53 - 67:57)
spawns like (67:56 - 67:59)
winter summer and fall and it doesn't (67:57 - 68:00)
spawn in spring (67:59 - 68:02)
like i guess my point is that i don't (68:00 - 68:03)
think that like (68:02 - 68:07)
if rattata is deemed a springtime (68:03 - 68:07)
pokemon (68:07 - 68:09)
that there is a zero percent chance i (68:07 - 68:10)
will see it in the fall (68:09 - 68:12)
okay so maybe it's not gonna spawn (68:10 - 68:14)
nearly as much but i do think that like (68:12 - 68:15)
they're still gonna (68:14 - 68:17)
have no other pokemon because they can (68:15 - 68:18)
fix this easily right (68:17 - 68:21)
so if look here here's an example and (68:18 - 68:22)
again this is (68:21 - 68:25)
this is some speculation if if they get (68:22 - 68:27)
if they say like okay skinny is only (68:25 - 68:29)
skinny is only spawning in the winter (68:27 - 68:30)
seasons (68:29 - 68:32)
per loin is only spawning in the um (68:30 - 68:33)
spring seasons (68:32 - 68:35)
we'll just do those for two for example (68:33 - 68:38)
because they're both bad cat pokemon (68:35 - 68:39)
that doesn't mean that there can't be an (68:38 - 68:42)
event in the springtime event that isn't (68:39 - 68:43)
like (68:42 - 68:46)
the delightful cat egg event where (68:43 - 68:47)
skitty purloin (68:46 - 68:49)
and litten are more are spawning in eggs (68:47 - 68:50)
right so they can (68:49 - 68:53)
cut pokemon from seasons but then they (68:50 - 68:54)
can force bring them back (68:53 - 68:56)
in advance so what they're doing that (68:54 - 68:58)
what they would be doing with this base (68:56 - 68:59)
work (68:58 - 69:01)
is cutting specific pokemon so you can (68:59 - 69:04)
be like man rattata only spawns in the (69:01 - 69:06)
in the winter season but hey there's a (69:04 - 69:08)
berry and squirrel event happening and (69:06 - 69:09)
squabbit (69:08 - 69:12)
rattata and uh amungus are now spawning (69:09 - 69:12)
in (69:12 - 69:15)
in march and they can bring pokemon back (69:12 - 69:16)
through events they've already (69:15 - 69:18)
technically have been doing this for the (69:16 - 69:20)
last year (69:18 - 69:22)
of forcing pokemon spawns to feel (69:20 - 69:24)
special the only thing they're (69:22 - 69:25)
on the only thing seasons are really (69:24 - 69:27)
doing is setting a precedent (69:25 - 69:31)
of you now accepting that pokemon are (69:27 - 69:32)
gone (69:31 - 69:34)
and once you once people accept pokemon (69:32 - 69:35)
are gone (69:34 - 69:38)
then they feel more obligated to play (69:35 - 69:40)
during the months they come back (69:38 - 69:42)
because they're introducing another (69:40 - 69:44)
level of uh fomo (69:42 - 69:46)
i mean i i agree with that part i just (69:44 - 69:47)
don't think that's going to apply to (69:46 - 69:48)
pidgey (69:47 - 69:52)
rattata i don't think they're getting (69:48 - 69:53)
rid of those (69:52 - 69:56)
base base first routes throughout (69:53 - 69:58)
that if they don't get rid of those (69:56 - 70:00)
first rounds i just don't feel like see (69:58 - 70:02)
then then there are seasons because (70:00 - 70:03)
there's just (70:02 - 70:07)
there's just so many pokemon now that (70:03 - 70:10)
they need to like separate them (70:07 - 70:12)
yeah i don't know and i guess that i (70:10 - 70:13)
mean i agree that they should i don't (70:12 - 70:15)
think they will (70:13 - 70:17)
like i don't think they're going to take (70:15 - 70:20)
away rattata pidgey spawns (70:17 - 70:23)
zubat spawns ever (70:20 - 70:25)
like i don't think those are ever going (70:23 - 70:27)
away i don't think they're gonna say (70:25 - 70:30)
we're limiting these incredibly trashy (70:27 - 70:31)
normal types (70:30 - 70:34)
to spring only no they are just going to (70:31 - 70:36)
always be the baseline (70:34 - 70:38)
and the things that have strong rarity (70:36 - 70:40)
are things that people are looking for (70:38 - 70:41)
are the things that people will feel (70:40 - 70:43)
like they're missing out on and will (70:41 - 70:44)
want to come back (70:43 - 70:46)
for i don't think that applies to the to (70:44 - 70:49)
the route one trashes (70:46 - 70:51)
i think those are going to be stuck (70:49 - 70:53)
forever no matter what you do (70:51 - 70:55)
if they were to like say caterpie's not (70:53 - 70:57)
spawning until spring (70:55 - 71:00)
and then somebody who who like they (70:57 - 71:00)
they're (71:00 - 71:02)
like missing a shiny caterpie and then (71:00 - 71:03)
spring comes around and they're like (71:02 - 71:05)
caterpie's back did you (71:03 - 71:08)
you missed them here he is people would (71:05 - 71:09)
be like oh man (71:08 - 71:11)
caterpie's back and now like that's the (71:09 - 71:12)
shiny i want like (71:11 - 71:16)
i i i think there's something (71:12 - 71:18)
okay i to bring it back to sword and (71:16 - 71:19)
shield (71:18 - 71:21)
literally everyone including myself we (71:19 - 71:22)
did the same (71:21 - 71:24)
dumb thing in the isle of armor we were (71:22 - 71:26)
like oh my gosh look at (71:24 - 71:28)
a poly toad and then you're like whoa (71:26 - 71:29)
wow look at (71:28 - 71:32)
uh uh a cramer ant and you're like oh (71:29 - 71:33)
wait no kramaran's not new (71:32 - 71:35)
but like you have that thing of being (71:33 - 71:37)
like oh look at all these pokemon that (71:35 - 71:38)
are returning (71:37 - 71:39)
and then you do the same thing for the (71:38 - 71:41)
crown tundra where you're like driving (71:39 - 71:42)
through and you're like (71:41 - 71:45)
whoa look at uh uh let's jinx oh wait (71:42 - 71:47)
hold on that's a jinx (71:45 - 71:49)
but you're like i mean you have that (71:47 - 71:50)
like i don't think that that is (71:49 - 71:51)
universal (71:50 - 71:53)
but you have that like second of (71:51 - 71:56)
excitement because (71:53 - 71:58)
as the pokemon company has proven for (71:56 - 71:59)
some reason (71:58 - 72:01)
we get really nostalgic about pokemon (71:59 - 72:03)
they take away from us (72:01 - 72:07)
and then they bring it back i think (72:03 - 72:10)
seasons are going to be a bit more (72:07 - 72:11)
extreme (72:10 - 72:13)
in removing pokemon than i feel like you (72:11 - 72:14)
guys are giving credit for (72:13 - 72:17)
i i have not seen any hint of that from (72:14 - 72:18)
what they put out (72:17 - 72:20)
did you read the rest of the article (72:18 - 72:23)
regarding that season of celebration (72:20 - 72:27)
research situation (72:23 - 72:27)
i think i just closed it it looks like (72:27 - 72:31)
there's going to be (72:29 - 72:33)
so starting on december 1st at 8 am and (72:31 - 72:35)
the first season will begin the season (72:33 - 72:37)
of celebration (72:35 - 72:38)
pokemon originally discovered in the (72:37 - 72:40)
kalos region will be appearing in (72:38 - 72:42)
pokemon go to celebrate their arrival (72:40 - 72:43)
professor willow is embarking on a quest (72:42 - 72:45)
to research the different regions of the (72:43 - 72:46)
pokemon world (72:45 - 72:48)
during the season so it sounds like (72:46 - 72:50)
during the entire season (72:48 - 72:52)
trainers will be able to participate in (72:50 - 72:54)
a series of in-game events (72:52 - 72:56)
featuring pokemon first discovered in (72:54 - 72:57)
different regions (72:56 - 72:59)
whether you're a fan of kanto johto hoen (72:57 - 73:02)
sinnoh unova or kalos pokemon originally (72:59 - 73:03)
discovered in each of these regions (73:02 - 73:05)
will be appearing as professor willow (73:03 - 73:07)
looks to discover and celebrate their (73:05 - 73:08)
rich histories (73:07 - 73:09)
yeah that's like the same as they've (73:08 - 73:11)
done for like unova (73:09 - 73:12)
like they did that for unova they did (73:11 - 73:14)
that for sinnoh they did that for hohen (73:12 - 73:15)
where they but they did them like (73:14 - 73:17)
immediately right it sounds like it's (73:15 - 73:18)
gonna like happen throughout the three (73:17 - 73:19)
months so i'm just going back to your (73:18 - 73:20)
like (73:19 - 73:22)
your point of like they can have these (73:20 - 73:23)
events where it's like (73:22 - 73:25)
not everything they can bring back (73:23 - 73:26)
skitty in like uh (73:25 - 73:29)
this is a hoenn specific one even though (73:26 - 73:30)
it's like (73:29 - 73:32)
skitty's a springtime pokemon but like (73:30 - 73:34)
here it is now for a little bit during (73:32 - 73:36)
this season or something like that (73:34 - 73:39)
like i would also probably say like (73:36 - 73:42)
i don't think that just because (73:39 - 73:45)
spheel might be a winter pokemon doesn't (73:42 - 73:46)
mean that's feel is (73:45 - 73:48)
always going to appear the same three (73:46 - 73:50)
months like i feel like (73:48 - 73:52)
like it could be possible where like (73:50 - 73:54)
they they just go like well we're gonna (73:52 - 73:56)
do spiel for (73:54 - 73:58)
like like i don't think one pokemon (73:56 - 73:59)
would be (73:58 - 74:01)
specific to a month either they could do (73:59 - 74:03)
like rattata is both (74:01 - 74:06)
spring and summer and now it's gone but (74:03 - 74:07)
that doesn't mean that (74:06 - 74:09)
coming spring and summer of next year (74:07 - 74:10)
it's gonna be rattata again it could (74:09 - 74:11)
just be maybe (74:10 - 74:13)
rattatas for spring next year like i (74:11 - 74:14)
think they can (74:13 - 74:16)
i don't think i don't think anything is (74:14 - 74:17)
set in stone i just think the (74:16 - 74:19)
the exciting thing about seasons is that (74:17 - 74:21)
they're saying like (74:19 - 74:23)
here are x amount of pokemon for three (74:21 - 74:26)
months and we are not afraid to cut the (74:23 - 74:28)
other x amount of pokemon (74:26 - 74:30)
for the time being that's what i that's (74:28 - 74:32)
that's ultimately what i think (74:30 - 74:35)
that would be i mean i would i'm excited (74:32 - 74:36)
to see this for sure i'm excited to see (74:35 - 74:38)
what they end up doing with it (74:36 - 74:39)
what you're saying would be great if (74:38 - 74:41)
they did something like that (74:39 - 74:45)
um will they act on it (74:41 - 74:48)
i will see also uh they talk about like (74:45 - 74:49)
dara mooka (74:48 - 74:52)
darumaka being available in the other (74:49 - 74:53)
houses (74:52 - 74:55)
like summer but like does that mean will (74:53 - 74:58)
galerion darumaka be available in (74:55 - 75:00)
our hemisphere since it's like seems (74:58 - 75:03)
like it's a winter type pokemon (75:00 - 75:05)
like will they will forms be different (75:03 - 75:06)
will they change will they do things (75:05 - 75:07)
like that or (75:06 - 75:09)
i wonder if it'll just be the pokemon (75:07 - 75:11)
species specifically (75:09 - 75:13)
yeah you know like could you know could (75:11 - 75:15)
you have like because they (75:13 - 75:17)
have formed these different like forms (75:15 - 75:18)
and stuff now like (75:17 - 75:19)
could you have like maybe a lowland (75:18 - 75:21)
rattata in the fall and regular rattata (75:19 - 75:22)
in the spring so you're getting a (75:21 - 75:24)
rattata of some kind (75:22 - 75:26)
either whether you're in each hemisphere (75:24 - 75:28)
in there during those seasons because (75:26 - 75:29)
right now i see both (75:28 - 75:32)
all the time right right so yeah they (75:29 - 75:33)
could do a thing where they could do a (75:32 - 75:34)
thing where they (75:33 - 75:37)
and they do on a shorter time span do (75:34 - 75:39)
the whole like well they did at one (75:37 - 75:41)
point i'm not sure how much it still (75:39 - 75:43)
works this way but the whole night and (75:41 - 75:45)
day thing right like (75:43 - 75:47)
you're much more likely to see uh an (75:45 - 75:49)
alolan rattata at night or like a hound (75:47 - 75:50)
hour at night because it's dark type (75:49 - 75:52)
and all that stuff like they were doing (75:50 - 75:53)
for a while or they would have like (75:52 - 75:54)
pokemon that were more apparent tonight (75:53 - 75:55)
than daytime (75:54 - 75:57)
um so they've done these kinds of things (75:55 - 76:00)
in the past um on a much shorter (75:57 - 76:04)
uh time line okay level 50. (76:00 - 76:06)
this is what everyone seems to be (76:04 - 76:07)
talking about but for the first time (76:06 - 76:09)
since the game's launch leveling up and (76:07 - 76:11)
go will be rebalanced there are many (76:09 - 76:12)
features and (76:11 - 76:14)
changes made to the games over the years (76:12 - 76:15)
we are revisiting them to make leveling (76:14 - 76:16)
more fun (76:15 - 76:18)
trainers who have reached level 40 will (76:16 - 76:20)
soon have the opportunity to level up to (76:18 - 76:21)
50 (76:20 - 76:23)
being one of the first uh bragging (76:21 - 76:25)
rights as a level 50 trainer if you're (76:23 - 76:26)
up for the challenge for players who (76:25 - 76:28)
haven't reached level 40 you'll find (76:26 - 76:30)
leveling up is easier than before for (76:28 - 76:31)
various adjustments of ways you can earn (76:30 - 76:32)
xp (76:31 - 76:35)
and then what they're doing is they (76:32 - 76:36)
worded this very specifically (76:35 - 76:39)
if you're a legacy 40 trainer not a (76:36 - 76:40)
legacy trainer there are plenty of (76:39 - 76:42)
people who started the game (76:40 - 76:44)
on what what day did it launch like (76:42 - 76:45)
december (76:44 - 76:48)
july 7th or something july (76:45 - 76:50)
6th is my start date yeah july 6th i (76:48 - 76:53)
believe i believe you can have the (76:50 - 76:55)
fifth if you're like in australia or (76:53 - 76:56)
something (76:55 - 76:58)
but i think july 6th is like the first (76:56 - 77:01)
day yeah july 6th for me too (76:58 - 77:04)
but if you're a legacy 40 trainer so if (77:01 - 77:04)
you hit (77:04 - 77:07)
if you are level 40 by december 31st at (77:04 - 77:07)
at (77:07 - 77:10)
midnight you will earn an exclusive (77:07 - 77:13)
gyarados hat and a special legacy (77:10 - 77:16)
40 medal to help trainers get to 40 (77:13 - 77:18)
faster double catch xp will be live (77:16 - 77:22)
until the rest of the year um if you (77:18 - 77:24)
didn't get that memo (77:22 - 77:26)
um additionally trainers will be able to (77:24 - 77:27)
power up uh (77:26 - 77:30)
pokemon higher than a level before (77:27 - 77:34)
and there's a bunch of (77:30 - 77:36)
stuff here australia already has this (77:34 - 77:37)
australia's (77:36 - 77:42)
niantic's guinea pig i guess yeah (77:37 - 77:44)
but uh like one of the examples for i (77:42 - 77:45)
think level 41 was (77:44 - 77:47)
and these could change i guess because (77:45 - 77:49)
technically it's not rolled out (77:47 - 77:51)
was you had to catch like 200 pokemon in (77:49 - 77:52)
a single day (77:51 - 77:56)
plus have a certain amount of xp plus (77:52 - 77:58)
um do like two other things yeah they've (77:56 - 77:59)
kind of listed out (77:58 - 78:02)
sort of what each of the levels is yeah (77:59 - 78:03)
i mean i know australia has like the (78:02 - 78:04)
actual tasks but (78:03 - 78:07)
i have uh 46 right here in front of me (78:04 - 78:09)
which is complete 100 field research (78:07 - 78:11)
tasks (78:09 - 78:13)
take a snapshot of a pokemon seven days (78:11 - 78:14)
in a row (78:13 - 78:17)
make 50 excellent throws and then hatch (78:14 - 78:18)
30 eggs plus (78:17 - 78:21)
you need the minimum xp that they want (78:18 - 78:23)
from you (78:21 - 78:27)
which here it says 15 (78:23 - 78:30)
million xp which that doesn't make sense (78:27 - 78:31)
to me because you need 20 million xp to (78:30 - 78:33)
be level 40. (78:31 - 78:35)
15 million xp on top of whatever level (78:33 - 78:37)
40. (78:35 - 78:40)
so like level 41 shows you it's (78:37 - 78:44)
like level 41 shows you it's uh (78:40 - 78:47)
you have so much out of that plus like 6 (78:44 - 78:49)
million like i think it's a level 41 (78:47 - 78:50)
it's 6 million (78:49 - 78:52)
more xp than whatever you have i see (78:50 - 78:54)
okay that makes sense (78:52 - 78:56)
i was like what are they lowering the xp (78:54 - 78:58)
why is it 15 million (78:56 - 78:59)
it's 20 million to get to level 40. (78:58 - 79:01)
that's like a kind of a weird way to (78:59 - 79:04)
communicate it yeah it's i think it like (79:01 - 79:05)
looks kind of weird the way that they (79:04 - 79:06)
have it (79:05 - 79:08)
set up as well but i don't know if that (79:06 - 79:09)
means (79:08 - 79:11)
so wait does that mean let's say you (79:09 - 79:13)
have what is it so it's 20 million to (79:11 - 79:14)
level 40 right yep (79:13 - 79:17)
so if you have and let's say it's (79:14 - 79:20)
it says like 6 million xp to get to 41 (79:17 - 79:22)
let's say you have 30 million xp total (79:20 - 79:23)
does that mean you've already cleared (79:22 - 79:24)
the six million or do you need to get (79:23 - 79:26)
six million more from the moment that (79:24 - 79:26)
this (79:26 - 79:29)
opens up so i i got a response from (79:26 - 79:30)
niantic from this (79:29 - 79:34)
your xp rolls over so if you have (79:30 - 79:37)
if you have 40 000 xp for sorry 40 (79:34 - 79:38)
million xp (79:37 - 79:42)
you would be clear to at least get to 46 (79:38 - 79:44)
because 46 you just need a bonus 15 (79:42 - 79:45)
million (79:44 - 79:47)
so that would be 35 i think okay i'm (79:45 - 79:48)
reading that right (79:47 - 79:51)
yeah anyways your xp rolls over (79:48 - 79:54)
so you're if you have 60 million xp (79:51 - 79:55)
you're you're good for the first couple (79:54 - 79:57)
levels you just have to do the task your (79:55 - 80:00)
tasks do not roll over so if you've (79:57 - 80:01)
completed (80:00 - 80:03)
uh like two mil if you completed two 2 (80:01 - 80:05)
000 field research (80:03 - 80:07)
and you get to level 46 once you get to (80:05 - 80:09)
46 you have to then complete (80:07 - 80:12)
another 100 field tasks same for like (80:09 - 80:14)
with team go rocket (80:12 - 80:16)
i think it's like level 45 you need to (80:14 - 80:17)
do like battle (80:16 - 80:20)
100 team go rocket grunts if you already (80:17 - 80:22)
battled 300 that doesn't count you have (80:20 - 80:24)
to once you get there (80:22 - 80:26)
you have to battle another 100 to (80:24 - 80:27)
complete that task (80:26 - 80:29)
so the only thing rolling over is your (80:27 - 80:30)
your xp (80:29 - 80:32)
levels okay and that makes sense that (80:30 - 80:34)
makes sense why the tasks are added (80:32 - 80:36)
because you know you've got your (80:34 - 80:37)
people out there with hundreds of (80:36 - 80:39)
millions of xp (80:37 - 80:43)
and so yeah um but you get nothing for (80:39 - 80:44)
being level 50. (80:43 - 80:46)
uh i mean i think you get like avatar (80:44 - 80:48)
items but (80:46 - 80:51)
um there's there's no gameplay changes (80:48 - 80:52)
here (80:51 - 80:55)
so for example once you hit level 40 (80:52 - 80:58)
um you can power your pokemon up to (80:55 - 81:01)
level 50 without you being 50 (80:58 - 81:04)
and you can power up your pokemon past (81:01 - 81:04)
level 40 (81:04 - 81:08)
sorry from 40 250 by using the new (81:04 - 81:11)
xl candy uh and there's multiple ways to (81:08 - 81:13)
earn excel candy you can earn it by (81:11 - 81:15)
trading you can earn it from (81:13 - 81:17)
hatching pokemon i believe you can earn (81:15 - 81:18)
it from raids (81:17 - 81:21)
but you use the xl candy to power a (81:18 - 81:22)
pokemon from (81:21 - 81:25)
level 40 to level 50 but you yourself (81:22 - 81:26)
don't have to be 50. nothing (81:25 - 81:30)
changes for you as a player character if (81:26 - 81:32)
you were 42 or if you were 48 nothing (81:30 - 81:33)
matters it's just (81:32 - 81:35)
literally bragging rights so except that (81:33 - 81:37)
the real real game begins (81:35 - 81:40)
yeah except right correct my gosh (81:37 - 81:42)
the real real game begins i mean i'm (81:40 - 81:44)
still not even level 40. and i'm not (81:42 - 81:46)
going to get to level 40 before december (81:44 - 81:47)
31st you don't think so (81:46 - 81:51)
what level level are you greg i'm 38 and (81:47 - 81:52)
three quarters (81:51 - 81:53)
oh you could get there before december (81:52 - 81:55)
31st (81:53 - 81:57)
don't you want the gyarados hat how am i (81:55 - 81:59)
going to do this before in a month (81:57 - 82:02)
they've doubled the xp catching for the (81:59 - 82:03)
rest of the year (82:02 - 82:06)
it's it's four million to get there and (82:03 - 82:10)
one one catch is like 200x (82:06 - 82:12)
well if you're enough of a sucker greg (82:10 - 82:14)
you'll do 50 he-tran raids with remote (82:12 - 82:15)
raid passes and (82:14 - 82:18)
not get the shiny i am not that much of (82:15 - 82:19)
a sucker (82:18 - 82:21)
uh you're getting double hearts right (82:19 - 82:23)
now when you open a gift (82:21 - 82:26)
yeah and you could open 45 gifts a day (82:23 - 82:28)
yeah that would require my buddy to (82:26 - 82:29)
bring me gifts (82:28 - 82:32)
yeah no you can open them have people (82:29 - 82:35)
send you gifts (82:32 - 82:35)
and then open 45 and that's two hearts a (82:36 - 82:40)
day (82:39 - 82:43)
and then just just pop a little (82:40 - 82:46)
egg two hearts for what oh like (82:43 - 82:47)
friendship (82:46 - 82:49)
friendship hearts because you need you (82:47 - 82:50)
need seven hearts for (82:49 - 82:53)
great friends and then 30 hearts for (82:50 - 82:56)
ultra friends and then what 90 days of (82:53 - 82:59)
hearts for best friends though yeah (82:56 - 83:01)
yeah not gonna happen hey look i'm (82:59 - 83:03)
trying to set you up for success (83:01 - 83:05)
[Laughter] (83:03 - 83:07)
i mean you all can send me stuff i mean (83:05 - 83:08)
i'll open your gifts (83:07 - 83:10)
but since my buddy is absolutely (83:08 - 83:12)
refusing to bring me gifts back (83:10 - 83:16)
this is not going to be a mutual street (83:12 - 83:16)
and tell you that much i think the (83:16 - 83:20)
overall challenge of getting the level (83:19 - 83:22)
50 i think it's cool (83:20 - 83:24)
i think i think maybe some people might (83:22 - 83:26)
get frustrated like they can't do it (83:24 - 83:28)
very quickly um but obviously it's not (83:26 - 83:30)
designed to do quickly (83:28 - 83:32)
and also it doesn't matter i'm sure (83:30 - 83:34)
there's going to be like (83:32 - 83:35)
it's like it's like that one person you (83:34 - 83:37)
meet at the like at the grocery store (83:35 - 83:39)
you're like waiting in line they're like (83:37 - 83:41)
wearing like a tank top (83:39 - 83:42)
and they're like kind of like looking at (83:41 - 83:44)
their muscles until you look over (83:42 - 83:46)
to them and then they're like hey man (83:44 - 83:49)
just to let you know i do crossfit (83:46 - 83:51)
and you're like yeah i don't need to (83:49 - 83:52)
know that but that's like literally (83:51 - 83:54)
every pokemon go player and go they're (83:52 - 83:54)
like (83:54 - 83:56)
oh are you playing pokemon go and you're (83:54 - 83:57)
like yeah they're like i'm level 40 and (83:56 - 83:59)
you're like geez i didn't i didn't even (83:57 - 84:00)
ask like why are you telling me like i (83:59 - 84:01)
don't care (84:00 - 84:04)
like that's it's like they're the same (84:01 - 84:05)
person as what i'm saying (84:04 - 84:07)
like none of this actually matters but (84:05 - 84:09)
you better believe as soon as i get 50 (84:07 - 84:10)
i'm letting you guys know every single (84:09 - 84:10)
podcast (84:10 - 84:13)
oh i know i i text with you on a (84:10 - 84:16)
continual basis (84:13 - 84:19)
you're the worst i'm excited though i (84:16 - 84:19)
think the (84:19 - 84:22)
challenge thing is is fun yeah i think i (84:19 - 84:23)
agree i think that (84:22 - 84:25)
people have been wanting this since the (84:23 - 84:27)
beginning or right or since (84:25 - 84:30)
like people they hit level 40 and (84:27 - 84:32)
for you know because we're human (84:30 - 84:34)
everybody needs (84:32 - 84:36)
like what they consider like an end goal (84:34 - 84:38)
for a game right they can't just like be (84:36 - 84:39)
okay with (84:38 - 84:41)
what it is and so this is a nice this is (84:39 - 84:42)
another nice (84:41 - 84:46)
uh goal for people to hit um (84:42 - 84:48)
that it again doesn't mean anything but (84:46 - 84:49)
it's a nice (84:48 - 84:52)
something to uh progress (84:49 - 84:54)
did we miss anything is that is that (84:52 - 84:57)
everything excel (84:54 - 85:00)
what go beyond his dumb oh (84:57 - 85:05)
the name yep uh yeah there's the 12 (85:00 - 85:07)
days of friendship event yeah that's (85:05 - 85:08)
going on now (85:07 - 85:10)
that's not yeah but that's not really (85:08 - 85:11)
any (85:10 - 85:14)
yeah yep i was gonna say it's not (85:11 - 85:16)
sorry i skipped this from the callow (85:14 - 85:19)
stuff it's not that exciting (85:16 - 85:21)
to me for the callow stuff because like (85:19 - 85:22)
chespin (85:21 - 85:24)
fennekin froakie bunnelby fletchling lit (85:22 - 85:26)
leo are gonna appear in the wild (85:24 - 85:29)
if you're in france you get klefki but (85:26 - 85:30)
bundle b is the garbage rap pokemon we (85:29 - 85:33)
just spent 20 minutes talking about (85:30 - 85:35)
it is the new rattata it is the new (85:33 - 85:37)
patrat (85:35 - 85:40)
so you'll be able to find (85:37 - 85:42)
what do you think 50 candy to evolve it (85:40 - 85:43)
so what is that (85:42 - 85:45)
like you get six so you need like 10 of (85:43 - 85:47)
them (85:45 - 85:49)
yeah you can find 10 of them probably (85:47 - 85:51)
within four minutes and now cool you you (85:49 - 85:53)
did it you did not have bundle b and you (85:51 - 85:56)
now have diggers be in like 10 minutes (85:53 - 85:58)
then that leaves like fletchling and lit (85:56 - 85:59)
leo which might be like (85:58 - 86:00)
slightly harder on the fletch things (85:59 - 86:02)
like the garbage pidgey although (86:00 - 86:03)
fletching is like significantly better (86:02 - 86:04)
than pidgey in like every (86:03 - 86:06)
yeah way in pretty much every way (86:04 - 86:08)
fletching will be like the 125 candy to (86:06 - 86:10)
get the talonflame (86:08 - 86:12)
yeah yeah yeah because you need 25 and (86:10 - 86:14)
then you need what a hundred (86:12 - 86:16)
yeah but like that wasn't hard with pduv (86:14 - 86:18)
and unpheasant like (86:16 - 86:22)
they were everywhere um and then lit leo (86:18 - 86:22)
is (86:22 - 86:24)
whatever so that just leaves like (86:22 - 86:26)
froakie fennekin and chespin and i (86:24 - 86:29)
this is like the new not new it's just (86:26 - 86:31)
like the thing that in pokemon go where (86:29 - 86:32)
you go (86:31 - 86:34)
why would i bother hunting for these (86:32 - 86:35)
because they're going to be the hardest (86:34 - 86:36)
ones out of the (86:35 - 86:39)
six pokemon to find even if i found like (86:36 - 86:42)
five in a day and i get to break breaks (86:39 - 86:44)
in braxton (86:42 - 86:47)
i'm going to have to spend so much time (86:44 - 86:49)
and effort to get to del fox but also i (86:47 - 86:52)
get punished for evolving to del fox (86:49 - 86:54)
because i didn't wait for community and (86:52 - 86:55)
also (86:54 - 86:57)
why why would i spend the time looking (86:55 - 86:59)
for these (86:57 - 87:01)
i guess to maybe like brag that i have (86:59 - 87:02)
them (87:01 - 87:05)
or maybe maybe one of them or two of (87:02 - 87:06)
them are really good for pvp and i need (87:05 - 87:08)
that for pvp (87:06 - 87:10)
why don't i just wait for community day (87:08 - 87:11)
where they have the best move and i (87:10 - 87:13)
don't have to do any work and they just (87:11 - 87:14)
come to me in my house (87:13 - 87:17)
with an incense well this goes this (87:14 - 87:18)
comes back to (87:17 - 87:20)
i mean right because we're already (87:18 - 87:21)
caught up right we're already caught up (87:20 - 87:22)
to calo so (87:21 - 87:24)
i mean the uh one thing they could do is (87:22 - 87:26)
just the community never involves the (87:24 - 87:27)
starters for (87:26 - 87:29)
gen 6 like they just cut that off and (87:27 - 87:32)
they don't do or they do it way later (87:29 - 87:35)
um but i mean it goes back to just like (87:32 - 87:37)
you know if you like collecting pokemon (87:35 - 87:39)
then you might hunt them and (87:37 - 87:41)
want to collect them i mean you can wait (87:39 - 87:43)
too but (87:41 - 87:46)
i mean i do miss the days of i guess (87:43 - 87:48)
this was like gen 2 when like they just (87:46 - 87:48)
dropped (87:48 - 87:50)
all of them yeah right like that was (87:48 - 87:52)
amazing that was so cool to just (87:50 - 87:54)
i mean they had the babies and the eggs (87:52 - 87:56)
but to (87:54 - 87:58)
walk out one day and it was just all of (87:56 - 87:59)
these pokemon there were so many new (87:58 - 88:01)
pokemon i mean i know there was only 100 (87:59 - 88:03)
total in gen 2 but (88:01 - 88:05)
uh that was amazing and i feel like they (88:03 - 88:06)
never really got back to that (88:05 - 88:10)
because they need to they want to like (88:06 - 88:13)
dribble a bit you know like yeah they (88:10 - 88:13)
want to (88:13 - 88:16)
do the the trip feed but yeah i guess my (88:13 - 88:18)
point is that i just really miss like (88:16 - 88:20)
the just dropping an entire generation (88:18 - 88:22)
and you know if they could come up with (88:20 - 88:23)
like a (88:22 - 88:25)
different way to keep people they have (88:23 - 88:26)
so many ways to keep people interested (88:25 - 88:27)
in the game at this point right they (88:26 - 88:29)
have raids and they have pvp and they (88:27 - 88:30)
have (88:29 - 88:31)
like trading they're opening up long (88:30 - 88:33)
distance trading and (88:31 - 88:35)
it almost seems like with so many (88:33 - 88:36)
different things to do (88:35 - 88:38)
like you could really drop more than (88:36 - 88:39)
just seven (88:38 - 88:41)
and not have to worry about people being (88:39 - 88:43)
really bored in a couple months (88:41 - 88:46)
you know like come time for like a lola (88:43 - 88:48)
in a year like it'd be great if they (88:46 - 88:50)
just dropped the whole generation (88:48 - 88:52)
for gen 7 at once because there are so (88:50 - 88:54)
many other things to keep people (88:52 - 88:54)
interested (88:54 - 88:56)
that even if i do get them all in the (88:54 - 88:58)
first couple months they're out (88:56 - 89:01)
there's still a lot you can do and not (88:58 - 89:03)
feel like oh i'm bored because there's (89:01 - 89:04)
not a new pokemon to catch (89:03 - 89:07)
i don't think i've evolved oshawott ted (89:04 - 89:09)
pig or (89:07 - 89:12)
snivy yet because like i have really (89:09 - 89:14)
good ones like i have a hundred (89:12 - 89:18)
iv tepig and i just (89:14 - 89:20)
like niantic has just taught me that i (89:18 - 89:22)
get punished for not waiting for the (89:20 - 89:24)
specific day to evolve it (89:22 - 89:26)
yeah because we can't tm them during the (89:24 - 89:28)
community today it's like (89:26 - 89:31)
exactly i there are some pokemon who i (89:28 - 89:32)
mean even more rare poke like i have a (89:31 - 89:35)
hundred percent uh iv gibble (89:32 - 89:38)
and i'm just like well like i feel like (89:35 - 89:40)
there will be eventually be (89:38 - 89:41)
even though it's shining again there'll (89:40 - 89:42)
be a kibble community today so i'm just (89:41 - 89:45)
not gonna evolve it until then right (89:42 - 89:47)
like i remember at the second ever go (89:45 - 89:48)
fest (89:47 - 89:51)
there was uh a hundred iv (89:48 - 89:53)
mudkip and there was like some guy who (89:51 - 89:54)
might keep (89:53 - 89:58)
100 i'm right here 100 iv mod cap (89:54 - 89:59)
and like all these people came running (89:58 - 90:02)
over and i caught it i was like oh cool (89:59 - 90:04)
100 iv mudkip sweet (90:02 - 90:07)
and then you know i evolved it (90:04 - 90:10)
to marshtop uh swampert (90:07 - 90:13)
and then the community happened and i (90:10 - 90:15)
don't have hydrocannon on it (90:13 - 90:17)
i mean but is hydra cannon really that (90:15 - 90:19)
worth it like what are you using (90:17 - 90:22)
like swampert is like super good in pvp (90:19 - 90:23)
because of hydrocannon (90:22 - 90:26)
but are you pvp no because i don't have (90:23 - 90:28)
hydrocannon (90:26 - 90:29)
i don't think that's the thing that's (90:28 - 90:30)
holding you back it is i mean i just (90:29 - 90:33)
literally i just literally used an elite (90:30 - 90:35)
tm on a swampert to turn it to (90:33 - 90:37)
hydrocannon to trade to somebody for (90:35 - 90:40)
a lucky trade because they wanted it so (90:37 - 90:42)
bad with hydrocannon (90:40 - 90:44)
now that's why his money spent i didn't (90:42 - 90:46)
spend i mean the elite tm came from (90:44 - 90:47)
whatever (90:46 - 90:48)
one of the i didn't spend money on an (90:47 - 90:51)
elite tm come on i'm not that much of a (90:48 - 90:51)
sucker (90:51 - 90:54)
remote raids incubated yeah they haven't (90:51 - 90:55)
got me there (90:54 - 90:59)
they've got me here but (90:55 - 91:03)
um it's fine it's whatever uh and then i (90:59 - 91:03)
think they're (91:03 - 91:05)
rolling out did they mention this in the (91:03 - 91:06)
press release i know we know this (91:05 - 91:08)
because it's already live in australia (91:06 - 91:10)
but there's platinum medals now (91:08 - 91:13)
so instead of gold medals um (91:10 - 91:15)
you can now earn platinum medals like i (91:13 - 91:17)
think for example one of the platinum (91:15 - 91:17)
metals (91:17 - 91:19)
and again i don't think it's final (91:17 - 91:21)
because it's not rolled out but (91:19 - 91:24)
technically in testing in australia (91:21 - 91:27)
i think one of them is uh the pikachu so (91:24 - 91:28)
pikachu is like (91:27 - 91:31)
catch three pikachu for bronze catch 50 (91:28 - 91:32)
pikachu for (91:31 - 91:36)
um silver catch 300 pikachu for (91:32 - 91:37)
gold and then i think it's catch a (91:36 - 91:40)
thousand pikachu for platinum (91:37 - 91:42)
yeesh they mention the platinum metals (91:40 - 91:44)
because you have to (91:42 - 91:45)
it says you have to get a certain number (91:44 - 91:48)
of platinum metals before getting to 43. (91:45 - 91:50)
yeah i think it's like but that's there (91:48 - 91:52)
was just that one mention of it and then (91:50 - 91:53)
before they dropped the (91:52 - 91:55)
test in australia people were like wait (91:53 - 91:56)
a second what's a platinum metal (91:55 - 92:00)
like like okay wow a thousand pikachu (91:56 - 92:00)
huh (92:00 - 92:03)
is what the yeah i'm up to 800. yeah (92:00 - 92:05)

greg give us our question of the week (93:58 - 94:02)
question of the week (94:00 - 94:06)
let's hear that question of the week (94:02 - 94:08)
i know you aren't because you're (94:06 - 94:09)
focusing on what (94:08 - 94:10)
what your world's gonna be like at level (94:09 - 94:14)
50 and it's nothing (94:10 - 94:14)
this is from franco for in our slack (94:15 - 94:18)
community (94:18 - 94:20)
for for somebody who's uh new to pokemon (94:18 - 94:22)
and wants to experience every region (94:20 - 94:23)
what is the correct combination of games (94:22 - 94:26)
to play in what order (94:23 - 94:29)
let's go heart goal sold server (94:26 - 94:32)
omega ruby alpha sapphire (94:29 - 94:34)
the remakes of sinnoh next year (94:32 - 94:37)
[Laughter] (94:34 - 94:41)
uh black and white black and white to (94:37 - 94:44)
xy sun and moon (94:41 - 94:46)
shield gosh okay well you're wrong no (94:44 - 94:49)
one should ever play sun and moon (94:46 - 94:52)
play ultra sun ultra moon oh sun and (94:49 - 94:54)
moon has the better story (94:52 - 94:57)
sun has the longer story it's the better (94:54 - 94:58)
story yeah it's (94:57 - 94:59)
it's it's definitely better that's like (94:58 - 95:01)
saying like (94:59 - 95:02)
you know you want to you want to (95:01 - 95:04)
remember it's like saying the real game (95:02 - 95:05)
starts at 40. (95:04 - 95:06)
it's like saying like you want to read (95:05 - 95:08)
like dr seuss's green eggs and ham or do (95:06 - 95:10)
you want to read dr seuss's like go dog (95:08 - 95:11)
go like (95:10 - 95:14)
like sure classic one is like slightly (95:11 - 95:15)
better than the other but i don't think (95:14 - 95:16)
like (95:15 - 95:17)
it's because you don't like story (95:16 - 95:19)
because you're a game gobbler no i do (95:17 - 95:22)
right well i think that (95:19 - 95:24)
you never read it i've seen you skip (95:22 - 95:26)
like a million times what are you doing (95:24 - 95:29)
you have you have had to ask me on (95:26 - 95:30)
multiple occasions (95:29 - 95:33)
on multiple games what happened okay in (95:30 - 95:34)
the story final fantasy (95:33 - 95:37)
is the worst at telling a story because (95:34 - 95:38)
they're like (95:37 - 95:39)
they'll do they'll do like they'll do (95:38 - 95:41)
like three lines of voice acting (95:39 - 95:44)
and they'll read it as slow as possible (95:41 - 95:46)
and then by the time like the story (95:44 - 95:47)
starts to get good (95:46 - 95:49)
then then they like cut the voice acting (95:47 - 95:50)
and then you have to read it yourself (95:49 - 95:52)
they give you reading at the bottom you (95:50 - 95:54)
can click and skip over the voice acting (95:52 - 95:56)
you don't have to wait you can just read (95:54 - 95:56)
but (95:56 - 95:59)
again you are opposed to reading story i (95:56 - 96:00)
have read (95:59 - 96:03)
every line of dialogue on my stream (96:00 - 96:06)
recorded for every pokemon game yeah (96:03 - 96:11)
because you have to now i don't have to (96:06 - 96:13)
but look there's only so much i can be (96:11 - 96:15)
called big d before i'm like come on (96:13 - 96:18)
dude well don't pick big d well it was (96:15 - 96:20)
either that or a little p (96:18 - 96:22)
i mean little p is more accurate wait (96:20 - 96:23)
why big d (96:22 - 96:27)
look you play x and y no what's the d (96:23 - 96:30)
though for d for oh bobby well (96:27 - 96:31)
i don't think we're allowed to answer (96:30 - 96:33)
that question on this podcast (96:31 - 96:35)
unfortunately (96:33 - 96:38)
jesus as it turns out d is for dog bobby (96:35 - 96:40)
jeez get your mind out of the gutter (96:38 - 96:42)
big dog (96:40 - 96:42)
um what was the question oh (96:44 - 96:49)
this is a hard question to answer (96:47 - 96:51)
because like you have to buy hardware (96:49 - 96:52)
and games to go (96:51 - 96:56)
yeah you do uh if you have a switch i (96:52 - 96:58)
think getting both let's go and sword (96:56 - 96:59)
and shield is good (96:58 - 97:03)
yeah uh if you have a 3ds i think (96:59 - 97:06)
x and y omega ruby and ultra ultrasound (97:03 - 97:08)
ultramoon are the way to go (97:06 - 97:09)
i don't think you go older than that (97:08 - 97:11)
though honestly (97:09 - 97:14)
like if you're really hardcore i guess (97:11 - 97:16)
you go back to black and white (97:14 - 97:19)
is what i would suggest yeah i mean (97:16 - 97:21)
but it does say every region you said (97:19 - 97:22)
every region though yeah (97:21 - 97:24)
so you have to go back because they (97:22 - 97:26)
haven't been remade (97:24 - 97:29)
i think that you have to go through the (97:26 - 97:31)
struggle that we went through (97:29 - 97:35)
no i don't know that's how you (97:31 - 97:35)
are so bad when you play them again (97:37 - 97:41)
you're like this is (97:40 - 97:45)
this is torture this is actual torture (97:41 - 97:48)
but i appreciate that no it doesn't it (97:45 - 97:50)
makes you hate them (97:48 - 97:52)
because you can you've experienced how (97:50 - 97:54)
good life can be (97:52 - 97:56)
and then you're like you know what i (97:54 - 97:58)
love having shoes and comfortable (97:56 - 97:58)
padding (97:58 - 98:03)
but instead i'm gonna walk on nails (97:58 - 98:07)
i couldn't go back to shoot my shoes but (98:03 - 98:10)
i'm just gonna walk on nails for for 20 (98:07 - 98:14)
hours 20 hours (98:10 - 98:17)
so that i appreciate my shoes more and (98:14 - 98:18)
everybody's like you know you don't have (98:17 - 98:19)
to walk on nails (98:18 - 98:22)
there's literally an older pair of shoes (98:19 - 98:23)
they remade (98:22 - 98:27)
that path with better shoes like nah (98:23 - 98:30)
nails only if hey i'm just saying (98:27 - 98:33)
if you don't have a switch and you want (98:30 - 98:35)
to play kanto (98:33 - 98:37)
you could either try to find leaf green (98:35 - 98:39)
or fire red for (98:37 - 98:40)
whatever can you even play that on 3ds (98:39 - 98:43)
no i can't even play it on 3ds right on (98:40 - 98:45)
the old (98:43 - 98:48)
um so you gotta go virtual console (98:45 - 98:50)
yeah i don't have to you don't do it (98:48 - 98:52)
it's better (98:50 - 98:54)
than an ideal situation if somebody had (98:52 - 98:56)
access to games and consoles (98:54 - 98:59)
and i guess never somebody who is new to (98:56 - 99:01)
pokemon wants to experience every region (98:59 - 99:02)
see (99:01 - 99:05)
that's like and it has all those (99:02 - 99:06)
consoles and games but never experienced (99:05 - 99:06)
that (99:06 - 99:09)
we are making a bet on like where like (99:06 - 99:10)
what is going to (99:09 - 99:12)
be entertaining enough for them to go (99:10 - 99:14)
through i would (99:12 - 99:15)
this is what i would say i would say you (99:14 - 99:19)
start with omega ruby alpha sapphire (99:15 - 99:20)
then you go greatest games then you go (99:19 - 99:23)
to x and y because i think x of y (99:20 - 99:27)
is a step up in in like discoverability (99:23 - 99:30)
and like variety is a step down in (99:27 - 99:31)
gameplay (99:30 - 99:34)
what x and y is so much worse than omega (99:31 - 99:35)
ruby alpha (99:34 - 99:38)
you know what in like what in every way (99:35 - 99:41)
i don't think so wow i don't think i (99:38 - 99:42)
don't know if i agree with that because (99:41 - 99:45)
because uh not every way because like (99:42 - 99:47)
literally (99:45 - 99:51)
figuratively i don't know whatever (99:47 - 99:54)
to use both words please uh omega ruby (99:51 - 99:55)
apple sapphire has (99:54 - 99:58)
hms and while (99:55 - 100:01)
x and y does have a gravity fair lets (99:58 - 100:03)
you fly on a latias (100:01 - 100:06)
around the world on a jet pokemon (100:03 - 100:09)
and has every legendary and all the (100:06 - 100:11)
megas including new ones (100:09 - 100:13)
and it's a great story x and y is (100:11 - 100:15)
weirdly paced (100:13 - 100:19)
and hasn't uh things happen (100:15 - 100:22)
oh they both have flaws but i think the (100:19 - 100:22)
the (100:22 - 100:24)
the i think we're awesome they all have (100:22 - 100:26)
flaws they the thing that x and y has (100:24 - 100:28)
going for it is it begins the (100:26 - 100:32)
removing of hm's which which (100:28 - 100:35)
for whatever reason omega ruby's alpha (100:32 - 100:37)
sapphire went 800 steps back on (100:35 - 100:40)
and they're just like hey look to the (100:37 - 100:41)
point where they're like rock (100:40 - 100:43)
rock smash isn't even an hm and they (100:41 - 100:45)
require you to have it to get (100:43 - 100:47)
through one route over and over again (100:45 - 100:49)
even after you rock smashed it (100:47 - 100:51)
it's so frustrating and there's no (100:49 - 100:52)
character customization because they (100:51 - 100:53)
went back on that (100:52 - 100:55)
because they're like hey this kid called (100:53 - 100:57)
brendan with a dumb hat you gotta be him (100:55 - 100:59)
and you're not allowed to do that is (100:57 - 101:02)
amazing and he has an incredible story (100:59 - 101:06)
like x and y is so good at making (101:02 - 101:09)
the character feel like you and giving (101:06 - 101:10)
you a (101:09 - 101:12)
huge variety of pokemon to catch early (101:10 - 101:14)
on which i think is a huge (101:12 - 101:16)
huge huge plus for anyone getting into (101:14 - 101:17)
pokemon (101:16 - 101:19)
whereas like if even though i think (101:17 - 101:21)
let's go is a good game (101:19 - 101:23)
what is your what is your route one (101:21 - 101:25)
experience rattata and pidgey (101:23 - 101:28)
cool but you are new to this you have to (101:25 - 101:29)
learn the basics (101:28 - 101:31)
that's why you don't get overwhelmed you (101:29 - 101:33)
learn with the garbage basics of omega (101:31 - 101:35)
ruby alpha sapphire which is (101:33 - 101:36)
limited pokemon on the the beginning (101:35 - 101:38)
routes (101:36 - 101:41)
no character customization and suffer (101:38 - 101:42)
through hms because this is the last (101:41 - 101:44)
game where you'll actually have to (101:42 - 101:45)
suffer through hms (101:44 - 101:47)
before you get to x and y where they (101:45 - 101:49)
hugely scale back on hm's (101:47 - 101:51)
they give you a huge variety of pokemon (101:49 - 101:52)
you can be yourself (101:51 - 101:54)
as a trainer then you move to ultrasound (101:52 - 101:56)
ultramoon (101:54 - 101:58)
get to experience all that again then (101:56 - 101:59)
you move to (101:58 - 102:01)
sword and shield and then if you were to (101:59 - 102:03)
make it through those four games (102:01 - 102:06)
then i would say your heart that that (102:03 - 102:06)
you're (102:06 - 102:09)
clearly desperate and dying for more (102:06 - 102:10)
pokemon content then i would say you go (102:09 - 102:11)
to black and white (102:10 - 102:14)
that would be my order okay so and just (102:11 - 102:15)
never seen (102:14 - 102:18)
four yeah where are you putting almia (102:15 - 102:20)
and ori (102:18 - 102:22)
because those are still two regions and (102:20 - 102:25)
the question does say every region oh my (102:22 - 102:27)
gosh (102:25 - 102:29)
where are you getting ore and which one (102:27 - 102:30)
are you doing for (102:29 - 102:34)
uh almia you finally the only answer is (102:30 - 102:37)
scales of darkness you find a trash can (102:34 - 102:39)
and or a grimer and then you throw those (102:37 - 102:42)
games into that (102:39 - 102:45)
no because those are good games which of (102:42 - 102:46)
the ranger game (102:45 - 102:48)
ranger spoke about ranger shadows follow (102:46 - 102:49)
me as a good game (102:48 - 102:51)
uh i never played it but i'll take your (102:49 - 102:53)
word for it also then we would have to (102:51 - 102:55)
also do the region of foray which is the (102:53 - 102:57)
first ranger game (102:55 - 102:59)
so you have to play both rangers you (102:57 - 103:01)
have to play gales of darkness (102:59 - 103:03)
and all the main games to experience (103:01 - 103:05)
every region that pokemon has to offer (103:03 - 103:06)
okay so (103:05 - 103:08)
and if you really want to jump into one (103:06 - 103:10)
more you hit up tumble cube island (103:08 - 103:12)
and play pokemon quest because it's (103:10 - 103:13)
wonderful (103:12 - 103:15)
yeah disrespect everything and just play (103:13 - 103:16)
quest (103:15 - 103:17)
[Laughter] (103:16 - 103:20)
is tumble cube island a region i don't (103:17 - 103:22)
know i guess it could technically (103:20 - 103:23)
probably be somewhere in kanto that was (103:22 - 103:24)
just never discovered (103:23 - 103:26)
i mean male 10's encanto was never (103:24 - 103:30)
discovered that's true (103:26 - 103:30)
that garbage pokemon oh yeah (103:30 - 103:34)
because there's no question of the week (103:33 - 103:37)

new transporter and pogo in general i (103:53 - 103:57)
understand people are frustrated (103:55 - 103:59)
but in times like these when everyone's (103:57 - 104:01)
frustrated about everything it's nice to (103:59 - 104:03)

take (104:03 - 104:05)
