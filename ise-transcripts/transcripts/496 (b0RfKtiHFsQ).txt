life (0:46 - 0:49)
i know why we're going to have so much (0:47 - 0:51)
fun catching will is bad (0:49 - 0:53)
i have returned from the islands of (0:51 - 0:56)
hawaii bringing you much love and aloha (0:53 - 0:58)
did you bring me poi (0:56 - 1:00)
no that stuff is nasty i know it's very (0:58 - 1:02)
bad (1:00 - 1:05)
do you say one thing i did like boy boy (1:02 - 1:07)
oh (1:05 - 1:09)
it's a food (1:07 - 1:11)
that tastes kind of like (1:09 - 1:15)
the closest thing would be plain yogurt (1:11 - 1:17)
i think that's an insult to plain yogurt (1:15 - 1:18)
well (1:17 - 1:20)
poi isn't (1:18 - 1:22)
i look look i can't critique poi if you (1:20 - 1:24)
eat it with the right things it's fine (1:22 - 1:25)
if you eat anything with the right (1:24 - 1:26)
things (1:25 - 1:28)
very few (1:26 - 1:32)
people seek out poi as a dish that they (1:28 - 1:34)
want to have on its own (1:32 - 1:36)
there is a special what is one of the (1:34 - 1:39)
special dishes whether like (1:36 - 1:42)
i mean i ate everything in hawaii i ate (1:39 - 1:44)
like it's like i get to go once a year (1:42 - 1:47)
and i eat literally every hawaiian thing (1:44 - 1:47)
my (1:47 - 1:50)
body does not appreciate (1:47 - 1:51)
me doing so (1:50 - 1:53)
but what is the thing that has like (1:51 - 1:55)
grown that's like a ground beef patty (1:53 - 1:58)
and rice and gravy loco moco yeah yeah (1:55 - 2:01)
look at that loco moco i had kailua pig (1:58 - 2:05)
i had a pork lau lau i had simon i had (2:01 - 2:09)
huli huli chicken oh man awesome (2:05 - 2:12)
too unfortunately and i'm glad that i'm (2:09 - 2:15)
able to restore myself i started like (2:12 - 2:16)
because when i was a little kid in (2:15 - 2:18)
hawaii i used to speak pidgin (2:16 - 2:20)
and man i started to get into my bad (2:18 - 2:23)
habits (2:20 - 2:23)
right back to where you started (2:24 - 2:29)
basically (2:26 - 2:29)
okay so for today's show we got a (2:30 - 2:36)
13 minute video on (2:33 - 2:38)
legends which we will discuss (2:36 - 2:40)
performances at (2:38 - 2:41)
a monster (2:40 - 2:45)
uh yep and then we have a little bit of (2:41 - 2:47)
other news but not a crazy amount of (2:45 - 2:49)
news i mean we could be very selective (2:47 - 2:50)
this week i suppose (2:49 - 2:51)
uh (2:50 - 2:54)
let's start with the (2:51 - 2:54)
let's start with the sword and shield (2:54 - 2:59)
news though uh which was that the (2:56 - 3:02)
japanese pokemon website announced that (2:59 - 3:06)
there will be the 2022 international (3:02 - 3:09)
challenges (3:06 - 3:11)
and there will be three different (3:09 - 3:12)
tournaments (3:11 - 3:15)
this was very similar to the end of (3:12 - 3:19)
ultrasound ultra moon which was the sun (3:15 - 3:22)
cup the ultra the sun cup the moon cup (3:19 - 3:24)
and then the ultra cup (3:22 - 3:26)
uh the only difference here is the rules (3:24 - 3:28)
are not changing between those it'll (3:26 - 3:31)
just be season 12 which they've already (3:28 - 3:32)
announced that season 12 will start on (3:31 - 3:35)
february 1st and then it will run until (3:32 - 3:38)
august which locks in the fact that (3:35 - 3:41)
that will be our our 2022 world format (3:38 - 3:42)
in (3:41 - 3:44)
uk (3:42 - 3:46)
if they decide to (3:44 - 3:48)
do that (3:46 - 3:49)
and (3:48 - 3:52)
if we get to have it yes yeah in london (3:49 - 3:54)
um when would it even be (3:52 - 3:56)
well it's usually august or september (3:54 - 3:59)
it's usually the first week of august (3:56 - 4:01)
hmm uh (3:59 - 4:02)
so i made a graphic for that that's on (4:01 - 4:04)
twitter twitter.com (4:02 - 4:06)
pkmencast that's also on instagram and (4:04 - 4:09)
stuff um if you need to remember but (4:06 - 4:10)
ultimately (4:09 - 4:12)
the first registration period will be (4:10 - 4:14)
between february 3rd to february 17th (4:12 - 4:16)
that's where you can sign up you'll be (4:14 - 4:18)
able to sign up in sword and shield how (4:16 - 4:19)

the tournament actually starts on (4:33 - 4:38)
february 18th once the tournament starts (4:35 - 4:40)
you cannot register anymore (4:38 - 4:43)
you have to register beforehand when the (4:40 - 4:44)
tournament starts that's when you can (4:43 - 4:46)

battle you can go into the battle with a (4:50 - 4:55)
wulu a squabbit uh (4:52 - 4:59)
klobupus and uh grap lock those are your (4:55 - 5:00)
four favorite (4:59 - 5:03)
it's uh sword and shield pokemon (5:00 - 5:03)
doesn't matter whether you win or lose (5:04 - 5:08)
once the battle is oh once the battles (5:06 - 5:09)
are over (5:08 - 5:12)
then you have to wait until (5:09 - 5:15)
um the rankings come out (5:12 - 5:16)
and then once the ranking comes out the (5:15 - 5:18)
gift will come and the this matters for (5:16 - 5:20)
everyone listening to the show because (5:18 - 5:23)
the gifts are for february shiny (5:20 - 5:24)
galerion articuno (5:23 - 5:27)
for march shiny galerion zapdos and then (5:24 - 5:31)
for april shiny galarian multrace (5:27 - 5:32)
now i definitely have to sign up because (5:31 - 5:34)
i haven't yeah i know (5:32 - 5:34)
it was in the game (5:34 - 5:36)
[Laughter] (5:34 - 5:38)
i wasn't gonna do it but now i have to (5:36 - 5:39)
do it (5:38 - 5:41)
um and then the (5:39 - 5:42)
the (5:41 - 5:44)
march tournament will be you can (5:42 - 5:46)
register between february 24th to march (5:44 - 5:46)
10th (5:46 - 5:49)
battles march 11th through the 13th (5:46 - 5:52)
registration for ape the mill trace (5:49 - 5:54)
which would be registration march 31st (5:52 - 5:56)
to april 14th battles april 15 through (5:54 - 5:57)
17th (5:56 - 6:00)
i did cross references with the (5:57 - 6:02)
regional tournaments that are happening (6:00 - 6:04)
none of these tournaments are taking (6:02 - 6:06)
place when a regional tournament is (6:04 - 6:07)
taking place so that would be like salt (6:06 - 6:10)
lake city uh orlando florida milwaukee (6:07 - 6:12)
wisconsin some place in canada there's (6:10 - 6:14)
like two other tournaments i'm not (6:12 - 6:16)
remembering i think one's in pittsburgh (6:14 - 6:18)
so none of these tournaments overlap (6:16 - 6:20)
with the regional tournaments that will (6:18 - 6:21)
be happening at least in the united (6:20 - 6:23)
states (6:21 - 6:23)
uh so that's relatively exciting it's (6:24 - 6:27)
also like this whole thing is very (6:25 - 6:29)
similar to the end of ultrasound (6:27 - 6:32)
ultramoon instead they did their sun (6:29 - 6:36)
moon ultra cup they gave out shiny (6:32 - 6:36)
tapu (6:36 - 6:38)
bulu lele (6:36 - 6:41)
finney (6:38 - 6:41)
if anything and we've talked about this (6:41 - 6:45)
before and this will kind of transition (6:42 - 6:47)
into us talking about legends (6:45 - 6:50)
this this seems (6:47 - 6:51)
like (6:50 - 6:53)
how can i say this (6:51 - 6:56)
there's always like the at any time (6:53 - 6:58)
there's anything pokemon related (6:56 - 7:00)
with games there's always when is the (6:58 - 7:02)
next game coming right even when like i (7:00 - 7:04)
remember the day that let's go pikachu (7:02 - 7:05)
let's go eevee came out and i was (7:04 - 7:06)
streaming on twitch and people were like (7:05 - 7:08)
what do you think the next like let's go (7:06 - 7:10)
game will be like (7:08 - 7:12)
this game has been out for two hours why (7:10 - 7:14)
are we like already looking forward to (7:12 - 7:17)
the next thing (7:14 - 7:18)
but (7:17 - 7:20)
like rumors and speculations aside of (7:18 - 7:22)
like when are they going to make black (7:20 - 7:24)
and white when are they going to remake (7:22 - 7:27)
johto when is gen 9 when is gen 10 (7:24 - 7:30)
i do really think the competitive scene (7:27 - 7:32)
for sword and shield points that were (7:30 - 7:34)
ready for (7:32 - 7:36)
the next game yeah (7:34 - 7:38)
cause (7:36 - 7:41)
the gs cup which is what the season 12 (7:38 - 7:44)
format will be which is two (7:41 - 7:46)
restricted legends restricted legends (7:44 - 7:48)
being the legends that appear on the box (7:46 - 7:51)
so you could use both kyogre and groudon (7:48 - 7:53)
on your team for example (7:51 - 7:56)
whereas past formats in (7:53 - 7:57)
sword and shield you could only use one (7:56 - 7:59)
restricted legend so you're only allowed (7:57 - 8:01)
to use groudon or you're only allowed to (7:59 - 8:03)
use kyogre you're only allowed to use (8:01 - 8:04)
ashian (8:03 - 8:07)
with this format (8:04 - 8:10)
being too restricted being the gs cup (8:07 - 8:12)
taking us to august (8:10 - 8:13)
them doing these birds just like how (8:12 - 8:18)
they did the tapus at the end of ultra (8:13 - 8:18)
if there was no gen 9 coming (8:19 - 8:23)
what is competitive supposed to do for a (8:23 - 8:26)
whole another year (8:25 - 8:27)
yeah (8:26 - 8:29)
it's also very similar to the way that (8:27 - 8:31)
they ended the omega ruby and alpha (8:29 - 8:33)
sapphire (8:31 - 8:35)
time period because that's really when (8:33 - 8:36)
they started to introduce the oh we'll (8:35 - 8:38)
do a competitive season where you can do (8:36 - 8:40)
the legendaries because previously it (8:38 - 8:41)
was like never (8:40 - 8:44)
legendaries ever (8:41 - 8:44)
yeah i think black 2y2 had like (8:45 - 8:49)
had (8:49 - 8:53)
they had restricted because i think you (8:51 - 8:55)
were allowed to use (8:53 - 8:57)
i remember i remember the early black (8:55 - 8:58)
and white (8:57 - 9:00)
where you were only allowed to use the (8:58 - 9:05)
the decks the black and white decks (9:00 - 9:05)
um (9:05 - 9:08)
i don't remember when those rules (9:06 - 9:09)
changed over (9:08 - 9:11)
obviously sword shield is the first game (9:09 - 9:13)
where (9:11 - 9:14)
they kept changing rules every like (9:13 - 9:16)
three months (9:14 - 9:19)
yeah yeah (9:16 - 9:19)
there could (9:20 - 9:24)
to be fair i guess necessarily it (9:22 - 9:28)
wouldn't have to be gen 9 it could be (9:24 - 9:30)
it could be anything (9:28 - 9:32)
it could be ultra (9:30 - 9:34)
sword ultra shield right they could (9:32 - 9:36)
package it all together and add some (9:34 - 9:37)
more stuff and then (9:36 - 9:39)
three years giving us the same game (9:37 - 9:42)
again (9:39 - 9:42)
i don't i don't think that's like the (9:42 - 9:47)
smart decision i think the dlc was fine (9:43 - 9:49)
i don't think repackaging it and adding (9:47 - 9:52)
even more stuff is is the correct way to (9:49 - 9:54)
go (9:52 - 9:54)
normally if gen 9 was coming out (9:55 - 10:00)
at the end of this year they would have (9:58 - 10:02)
teased it at the end of last year (10:00 - 10:05)
i don't think so they have in the past (10:02 - 10:07)
they have in the past but with sword and (10:05 - 10:09)
shield they yeah but teased it in (10:07 - 10:11)
february and then it came out that year (10:09 - 10:13)
yeah and with uh (10:11 - 10:16)
with kalos with x and y it was like it (10:13 - 10:18)
was february where you saw the pikachu (10:16 - 10:20)
on this on the eiffel tower and then (10:18 - 10:23)
october when the game came out (10:20 - 10:23)
so they've done the same year yeah (10:24 - 10:27)
definitely they have (10:25 - 10:28)
i'm just (10:27 - 10:30)
wondering if (10:28 - 10:34)
also that in the case of releasing (10:30 - 10:36)
diamond and pro remakes and legends they (10:34 - 10:37)
wouldn't want to (10:36 - 10:39)
detract from those sales (10:37 - 10:41)
yeah (10:39 - 10:41)
my only my only like (10:42 - 10:45)
i do believe i do believe the (10:44 - 10:47)
speculation that legends was probably (10:45 - 10:48)
supposed to come out earlier and it (10:47 - 10:50)
probably got delayed because of covid (10:48 - 10:52)
stuff i agree and i feel like they were (10:50 - 10:55)
like well we have to get it out before (10:52 - 10:57)
february because february is when we're (10:55 - 10:59)
announcing tonight (10:57 - 11:02)
i agree that's very i yes i i just i (10:59 - 11:04)
almost have i have also really been (11:02 - 11:06)
thinking like (11:04 - 11:09)
that they pushed ilka to get diamond and (11:06 - 11:11)
pearl out just so they could have (11:09 - 11:14)
something in 2021 and they're like well (11:11 - 11:15)
we don't have to take responsibility for (11:14 - 11:18)
this because it's not us (11:15 - 11:19)
and we got the good game it's just not (11:18 - 11:24)
coming in the 25th anniversary year (11:19 - 11:24)
yeah i i'm sure that i'm sure that covid (11:26 - 11:31)
and switching to a work at home (11:29 - 11:34)
lifestyle messed a lot of things up for (11:31 - 11:36)
a lot of game companies not specifically (11:34 - 11:38)
game freak um we've heard for everybody (11:36 - 11:41)
yeah (11:38 - 11:41)
i'm i'm going to say (11:41 - 11:46)
given (11:44 - 11:46)
the state of everything right now (11:47 - 11:51)
i would be concerned if they're going to (11:52 - 11:58)
try to get gen 9 out this year (11:54 - 11:58)
well ideally they would have been (11:58 - 12:01)
working on it since the end of sort (11:59 - 12:04)
right yeah that that but (12:01 - 12:06)
people can't get things to make things (12:04 - 12:08)
right now (12:06 - 12:08)
would you be like ramen noodles to sit (12:09 - 12:12)
at home (12:11 - 12:13)
like yourself (12:12 - 12:15)
uh we can point to (12:13 - 12:16)
the game that i'm playing a lot of right (12:15 - 12:18)
now which is final fantasy 14 which (12:16 - 12:20)
can't get any new servers or any (12:18 - 12:22)
computer equipment or anything (12:20 - 12:25)
to expand on anything that they're doing (12:22 - 12:27)
people can't make cartridges people (12:25 - 12:28)
can't make (12:27 - 12:32)
anything right now i am concerned (12:28 - 12:35)
uh because there is no end in sight for (12:32 - 12:37)
any of the shipping (12:35 - 12:39)
manufacturing equipment problems (12:37 - 12:41)
physical copies do everything is (12:39 - 12:44)
downloadable and problem solved mostly (12:41 - 12:46)
kind of yeah but it's also coming up (12:44 - 12:48)
with switch problems like they can't (12:46 - 12:50)
make switches they can't make a lot of (12:48 - 12:51)
things well too you shouldn't have (12:50 - 12:55)
waited get get the switch (12:51 - 12:57)
either (12:55 - 12:57)
i'm i i guess i'm not too worried about (12:59 - 13:07)
the game not being like done (13:04 - 13:09)
because they've (13:07 - 13:11)
they when they were making certain (13:09 - 13:13)
shield they made little town hero when (13:11 - 13:15)
they were making let's go they made like (13:13 - 13:17)
they had let's go pikachu and evie come (13:15 - 13:19)
out and they had (13:17 - 13:21)
uh pokemon quest came out and they had (13:19 - 13:23)
sword and shield come out like (13:21 - 13:24)
they they definitely have upped the (13:23 - 13:26)
amount of employees that have worked (13:24 - 13:27)
there since (13:26 - 13:31)
ultra since sun and moon (13:27 - 13:33)
and i still (13:31 - 13:35)
again this will bring this will move us (13:33 - 13:38)
into the legends (13:35 - 13:39)
game (13:38 - 13:41)
and seeing they showed their hand (13:39 - 13:43)
they were like here's 13 minutes of what (13:41 - 13:45)
you're doing in legends (13:43 - 13:48)
and if i was if i was to take legends (13:45 - 13:50)
and i would to put it on a scale (13:48 - 13:52)
of whether it's going to be closer to (13:50 - 13:54)
sword and shield or whether it's going (13:52 - 13:55)
to be closer to let's go pikachu let's (13:54 - 13:58)
go eevee and before i put it on the (13:55 - 14:00)
scale i will say i like both these games (13:58 - 14:01)
a lot (14:00 - 14:03)
but let's go pikachu let's see (14:01 - 14:04)
all right (14:03 - 14:06)
let's go (14:04 - 14:08)
let me explain let's go pikachu let's go (14:06 - 14:09)
evie doesn't have nearly as much content (14:08 - 14:11)
as sword and shield that's the scale (14:09 - 14:13)
okay oh okay (14:11 - 14:15)
so like let's go pikachu let's go eevee (14:13 - 14:17)
i think a very delightful game 150 (14:15 - 14:20)
pokemon eight gym leaders you can really (14:17 - 14:23)
blaze through it not a lot to do post (14:20 - 14:25)
game you can still of course shiny hunt (14:23 - 14:26)
you could still of course build a team (14:25 - 14:29)
to battle if you wanted to but there's (14:26 - 14:30)
there's no breeding in that game there's (14:29 - 14:32)
no abilities you know there's there's (14:30 - 14:34)
there's not a lot of complexity in let's (14:32 - 14:36)
go pikachu let's go eevee that's okay i (14:34 - 14:38)
think it's still a great game (14:36 - 14:39)
sword and shield (14:38 - 14:41)
tons of things to do 400 pokemon to (14:39 - 14:43)
collect max raid battles the battle (14:41 - 14:45)
tower um (14:43 - 14:47)
different areas with like (14:45 - 14:49)
side quests like you can get that ghost (14:47 - 14:51)
girl storyline and stuff online (14:49 - 14:53)
competitive battle breeding advanced (14:51 - 14:56)
breeding shiny hunting so in like in a (14:53 - 14:58)
scale of let's go pikachu let's go eevee (14:56 - 15:00)
being a very simple but still enjoyable (14:58 - 15:02)
pokemon experience and sword and shield (15:00 - 15:03)
being like probably the most complicated (15:02 - 15:05)
pokemon experience you're gonna get from (15:03 - 15:07)
game freak (15:05 - 15:09)
legends seems to me based off this (15:07 - 15:10)
trailer and based off of everything (15:09 - 15:12)
they've shown in the last year it is (15:10 - 15:13)
closer to a let's go pikachu let's go (15:12 - 15:15)
eevee i don't think it's going to be (15:13 - 15:18)
this grand adventure that (15:15 - 15:19)
that people aren't even comparing to (15:18 - 15:20)
sword and shield they're comparing to (15:19 - 15:23)
breath of the wild which (15:20 - 15:25)
i don't think is going to happen i think (15:23 - 15:27)
the appropriate scale is uh on a scale (15:25 - 15:31)
of monster hunter rise to (15:27 - 15:32)
pokemon (15:31 - 15:34)
red and blue (15:32 - 15:36)
it's gonna be (15:34 - 15:39)
much like monster hunter rise with maybe (15:36 - 15:41)
a little less complexity because man it (15:39 - 15:44)
looks so similar to a monster hunter (15:41 - 15:46)
game (15:44 - 15:49)
it's like incredible (15:46 - 15:49)
which means that they could do have a (15:52 - 15:57)
lot of dlc for the different quests that (15:54 - 15:58)
people are going to ask you to complete (15:57 - 16:00)
for them which can just (15:58 - 16:02)
add content as time goes on in a very (16:00 - 16:05)
simple way (16:02 - 16:05)
yeah they could again go back to our (16:05 - 16:10)
earlier conversation and not announce a (16:08 - 16:13)
gen 9 and just announce legends dlc or (16:10 - 16:15)
an expansion for the the fall oh man (16:13 - 16:17)
that would be the real monster (16:15 - 16:19)
it's like we'll give you the mini game (16:17 - 16:21)
first and then we'll give you the maxi (16:19 - 16:23)
game later (16:21 - 16:24)
but (16:23 - 16:26)
again what do you do with competitive (16:24 - 16:29)
and you're like what does your 2023 (16:26 - 16:31)
season look like for cancel it no more (16:29 - 16:32)
competitive nobody wants to do that what (16:31 - 16:35)
is your what does after august look like (16:32 - 16:39)
competitive wise for for (16:35 - 16:39)
and i know people some of the people (16:40 - 16:43)
listening to the show don't care about (16:42 - 16:44)
competitive but that is such an (16:43 - 16:45)
important pillar (16:44 - 16:47)
so here's the problem over the years (16:45 - 16:49)
like (16:47 - 16:51)
it is an important pillar it absolutely (16:49 - 16:53)
is but also (16:51 - 16:55)
we don't know (16:53 - 16:57)
we can't predict if there's even going (16:55 - 17:00)
to be a competitive scene in august at (16:57 - 17:02)
this point well but competitive is (17:00 - 17:04)
always online so it's like it can always (17:02 - 17:07)
exist it can exist but they may i mean (17:04 - 17:10)
we they may still be like (17:07 - 17:12)
we are pushing everything off because (17:10 - 17:15)
it's important to have a vibrant (17:12 - 17:17)
when we come back we are coming back (17:15 - 17:19)
very strong i mean they put their flag (17:17 - 17:22)
in the sand when they announced (17:19 - 17:24)
diamond and pearl and they were like no (17:22 - 17:26)
competitive it will remain in sword and (17:24 - 17:28)
shield right and they knew that this end (17:26 - 17:30)
date was coming (17:28 - 17:32)
they have to have a plan after this end (17:30 - 17:34)
date one thing that they can always do (17:32 - 17:36)
we have to you know think outside of the (17:34 - 17:37)
box a little bit (17:36 - 17:38)
is (17:37 - 17:42)
disassociate the competitive pokemon (17:38 - 17:46)
from the story type pokemon game and (17:42 - 17:48)
just make like the official version of (17:46 - 17:50)
pokemon showdown (17:48 - 17:53)
yeah we're going to get pokemon battle (17:50 - 17:55)
revolution 2 (17:53 - 17:57)
which is where all competitive is going (17:55 - 18:00)
it's like you you you make your pokemon (17:57 - 18:03)
in whatever game is approved to generate (18:00 - 18:05)
pokemon for competitive bring it into (18:03 - 18:07)
the battle system (18:05 - 18:08)
have your battles there that's where (18:07 - 18:10)
competitive is and then they can always (18:08 - 18:12)
like that can be ever green they can (18:10 - 18:14)
manage rule sets and everything within (18:12 - 18:16)
that one system and not have it tied to (18:14 - 18:19)
a specific generation of pokemon games i (18:16 - 18:21)
would like that a lot better than that (18:19 - 18:22)
right (18:21 - 18:24)
it could filter through pokemon home (18:22 - 18:26)
yeah things have to come through pokemon (18:24 - 18:28)
home meet criteria if they meet those (18:26 - 18:31)
criteria then put them into the battle (18:28 - 18:33)
simulator or battle (18:31 - 18:36)
pro pokemon battle revolution 2. (18:33 - 18:38)
one of the one of the one of the few (18:36 - 18:40)
games that i'm like i just (18:38 - 18:43)
could never like that game (18:40 - 18:47)
i tried the announcer is great though (18:43 - 18:47)
uh greg what did you think about this (18:48 - 18:52)
13-minute trailer uh i mean it's good i (18:50 - 18:55)
feel like (18:52 - 18:57)
i'm setting my expectations that the (18:55 - 18:58)
amount of pokemon that are going to be (18:57 - 19:00)
in this game is similar to how many were (18:58 - 19:02)
in snap (19:00 - 19:04)
i feel like there's going to be around (19:02 - 19:08)
250 that they're going to pick (19:04 - 19:09)
uh with (19:08 - 19:10)
with new forms (19:09 - 19:12)
uh for some of them (19:10 - 19:14)
uh i think 250 i don't remember what (19:12 - 19:18)
snap was that was 214 (19:14 - 19:18)
pretty sure it was 214. (19:19 - 19:22)
yeah (19:20 - 19:23)
so and i i'm i'm rounding it up for a (19:22 - 19:25)
nice number 250. (19:23 - 19:27)
uh the biggest one that's the number (19:25 - 19:32)
they like 251 251 yeah 251. um (19:27 - 19:34)
i thought it looked good i (19:32 - 19:36)
i think they pretty much (19:34 - 19:38)
also underlined this isn't an open world (19:36 - 19:41)
game because regions unlock (19:38 - 19:43)
like they showed like (19:41 - 19:45)
you're on this section and everything (19:43 - 19:48)
else was covered in clouds (19:45 - 19:49)
so (19:48 - 19:52)
i feel like it's a wild area situation (19:49 - 19:54)
where it's open world in that one region (19:52 - 19:57)
but new regions will unlock as you do (19:54 - 19:59)
things in the game or deal with (19:57 - 20:02)
noble versus alpha pokemon i (19:59 - 20:04)
you know put it here i don't like the (20:02 - 20:06)
term alpha pokemon but whatever it's out (20:04 - 20:08)
there (20:06 - 20:10)
that is a very um (20:08 - 20:12)
monster hunter way of doing things like (20:10 - 20:13)
when you're a monster hunter and you're (20:12 - 20:16)
assigned to do a particular quest like (20:13 - 20:18)
the quest is in (20:16 - 20:21)
area a or area b or area c and when you (20:18 - 20:23)
go you go out to that area and there's a (20:21 - 20:26)
lot of room to wander around in but you (20:23 - 20:29)
can't go well monster underworld now now (20:26 - 20:31)
you still couldn't cross over to (20:29 - 20:33)
different areas (20:31 - 20:34)
they were on the map next to each other (20:33 - 20:37)
but you still you went to one particular (20:34 - 20:39)
one and that's where you ran around (20:37 - 20:41)
i think they can fairly say it's not (20:39 - 20:42)
going to be this gigantic world that you (20:41 - 20:44)
just wander around in like you (20:42 - 20:46)
specifically set out four regions yeah (20:44 - 20:48)
and you're gonna have to keep coming (20:46 - 20:51)
back to juba life yeah and as you get (20:48 - 20:54)
pokemon to ride new regions will open up (20:51 - 20:55)
that you can get to (20:54 - 20:57)
so (20:55 - 20:59)
i think in the world that's interesting (20:57 - 21:02)
i'm (20:59 - 21:02)
i'm curious about how (21:02 - 21:07)
i'm going to like the sort of sneaking (21:08 - 21:11)
system (21:10 - 21:14)
in this one like (21:11 - 21:14)
you sneak around and you have to come (21:15 - 21:18)
from behind or they see you and then you (21:17 - 21:20)
have to better (21:18 - 21:22)
i i am 100 (21:20 - 21:24)
into the (21:22 - 21:27)
pokeball firing up a firework when it's (21:24 - 21:28)
caught the pokemon that is the cutest (21:27 - 21:30)
thing i like that little noise and i (21:28 - 21:32)
want i want that in the real games i (21:30 - 21:34)
want a little firework (21:32 - 21:36)
um (21:34 - 21:39)
i think the game looks good like i'm (21:36 - 21:41)
like oh it's pretty (21:39 - 21:43)
uh i think (21:41 - 21:46)
it's nice that they showed off (21:43 - 21:46)
there's a lot i think that i think my (21:48 - 21:53)
fear was there wasn't going to like it (21:50 - 21:54)
was going to be like diamond and pearl (21:53 - 21:56)
customization where you had (21:54 - 21:59)
the whole outfit oh yeah pieces and they (21:56 - 22:02)
showed off pieces so (21:59 - 22:02)
solid (22:02 - 22:05)
yeah i think um (22:05 - 22:10)
i did i did i couldn't help but laugh (22:08 - 22:11)
when they the first minute in the (22:10 - 22:13)
trailer they show the the the trainer (22:11 - 22:16)
like slowly walking into the the field (22:13 - 22:17)
and they're like (22:16 - 22:18)
vast (22:17 - 22:21)
areas that you can explore with tons of (22:18 - 22:22)
pokemon and like not a single pokemon (22:21 - 22:25)
was on screen yeah that was an issue yes (22:22 - 22:26)
and then he like takes a couple more (22:25 - 22:28)
steps and there's like three b dupes and (22:26 - 22:30)
it's like yeah that's looking really (22:28 - 22:32)
vast right now yeah i'm not gonna give (22:30 - 22:34)
away the secret (22:32 - 22:36)
they've deleted some from that (22:34 - 22:38)
screenshot (22:36 - 22:38)
um (22:39 - 22:41)
so i'm a little concerned with the (22:40 - 22:44)
sneaking stuff too just because i don't (22:41 - 22:47)
particularly like stealth in (22:44 - 22:49)
games but also they they made that like (22:47 - 22:51)
a big deal do you remember the like (22:49 - 22:53)
nintendo treehouse of sword and shield (22:51 - 22:54)
where they're like you can sneak and (22:53 - 22:56)
hide in the grass and they like caught a (22:54 - 22:58)
wingle and everyone was yeah mad that (22:56 - 22:59)
the winkle didn't like flap its wings or (22:58 - 23:02)
something but it's like they made that a (22:59 - 23:04)
big deal but i don't think i ever in the (23:02 - 23:06)
2000 hours i played sword and shield (23:04 - 23:07)
felt like i needed to sneak up on (23:06 - 23:08)
something (23:07 - 23:12)
no i do feel like it's going to be us (23:08 - 23:15)
so the way it seemed to me in the (23:12 - 23:16)
trailer was (23:15 - 23:20)
it's easier if you use sneaking (23:16 - 23:22)
otherwise you are going to have to go (23:20 - 23:24)
into a battle to weaken yeah the thing (23:22 - 23:26)
yeah so (23:24 - 23:28)
sneaking is going to be easier (23:26 - 23:31)
uh because things will either come at (23:28 - 23:33)
you or run away from you based off of (23:31 - 23:34)
the personality (23:33 - 23:37)
uh so in general if you just want to (23:34 - 23:39)
catch sneaking is going to be your route (23:37 - 23:40)
but (23:39 - 23:43)
also you can do these other things (23:40 - 23:43)
um i am (23:43 - 23:47)
so okay correct me if i'm wrong (23:48 - 23:53)
but (23:51 - 23:56)
every move can be chosen to be either (23:53 - 23:58)
agile or strong (23:56 - 24:01)
did you get that from the trailer (23:58 - 24:01)
okay but i don't know if it was like (24:03 - 24:09)
you only have (24:07 - 24:11)
a certain amount per battle and they (24:09 - 24:14)
reset like a z move situation (24:11 - 24:16)
or yeah or if they're pulling from some (24:14 - 24:19)
sort of inventory of like (24:16 - 24:20)
collecting (24:19 - 24:23)
scrolls like that's what i was unsure of (24:20 - 24:24)
so (24:23 - 24:27)
the way it (24:24 - 24:30)
the way it felt to me was (24:27 - 24:33)
you will be able so if you select (24:30 - 24:36)
agile it cuts the power if you select (24:33 - 24:38)
strong it (24:36 - 24:40)
increases the power but also there's (24:38 - 24:43)
just a regular just used move right yes (24:40 - 24:46)
yeah yes okay so i don't know if that's (24:43 - 24:48)
good i don't know if that's going to be (24:46 - 24:49)
limited (24:48 - 24:51)
into how many of those you get because (24:49 - 24:52)
but there's a consequence to both of (24:51 - 24:55)
them right if you do agile you move the (24:52 - 24:57)
move goes faster than it should but it's (24:55 - 25:00)
less powerful if you choose strong (24:57 - 25:04)
the move is more powerful (25:00 - 25:05)
and the opponent will get more attacks (25:04 - 25:07)
in before you get to attack again (25:05 - 25:11)
so my question about that system is for (25:07 - 25:14)
things that don't do damage so for a (25:11 - 25:15)
thunder wave (25:14 - 25:17)
where you want apparel you know get (25:15 - 25:20)
paralysis on there is there any reason (25:17 - 25:22)
why you wouldn't use agile because it (25:20 - 25:23)
would go fast and you get an immediate (25:22 - 25:24)
turn (25:23 - 25:28)
because what is it reducing in power (25:24 - 25:29)
well (25:28 - 25:31)
i don't have an answer to that but they (25:29 - 25:34)
the cleaver uses stealth rock (25:31 - 25:35)
yeah in the trailer and stealth rock (25:34 - 25:38)
just straight up does damage right away (25:35 - 25:39)
yep (25:38 - 25:41)
and seems to continue to be doing damage (25:39 - 25:44)
yeah so was that like strong style (25:41 - 25:45)
stealth rock (25:44 - 25:47)
yeah i don't know i have a lot of (25:45 - 25:49)
questions strong style thunder wave does (25:47 - 25:53)
it do electric damage and then paralyze (25:49 - 25:53)
hmm yeah the i mean i'm i'm intrigued by (25:55 - 26:01)
the system (25:59 - 26:03)
it it it's a weird (26:01 - 26:06)
active turn based system (26:03 - 26:07)
and (26:06 - 26:08)
it (26:07 - 26:10)
100 (26:08 - 26:13)
reminds me of final fantasy tactics (26:10 - 26:14)
uh (26:13 - 26:16)
so i already am like immediately into (26:14 - 26:18)
this battle system (26:16 - 26:20)
and i i like those choices as long as (26:18 - 26:22)
it's easy to see the turn order right (26:20 - 26:24)
like as long as it's easy to tell if i (26:22 - 26:26)
do this as agile this is what i'm (26:24 - 26:27)
getting (26:26 - 26:30)
if that is hidden or confusing then it's (26:27 - 26:33)
going to be a problem (26:30 - 26:33)
they showed like um (26:36 - 26:40)
they showed the trainer like running on (26:38 - 26:42)
weird deer and then running to the edge (26:40 - 26:43)
of a cliff and then it transitioning (26:42 - 26:47)
into bravery yeah like just jumping (26:43 - 26:49)
and i don't know if they hit like a (26:47 - 26:51)
button to do that or if it was automatic (26:49 - 26:54)
but it was it was really clean in a (26:51 - 26:56)
couple of the screenshots they have (26:54 - 26:59)
above they have the symbols of the (26:56 - 27:02)
pokemon that are writable did you see (26:59 - 27:04)
that yeah it's like above the pokeball (27:02 - 27:06)
yeah so i'm i'm wondering if it's just (27:04 - 27:09)
as easy as you switch between the (27:06 - 27:13)
the icon and you immediately change (27:09 - 27:15)
because they had two arrows next to it (27:13 - 27:17)
so i'm imagining (27:15 - 27:20)
like you just hit the arrow over (27:17 - 27:22)
to switch to the next one because it was (27:20 - 27:25)
very smooth in the in the trailer i want (27:22 - 27:27)
to see a graphic of me like jumping off (27:25 - 27:29)
the weird air or just off into i want to (27:27 - 27:30)
see (27:29 - 27:32)
air and then the braviaries flies under (27:30 - 27:35)
me i wanna see the braviary come grab (27:32 - 27:37)
and kill the weirder and pick you up in (27:35 - 27:39)
this claws (27:37 - 27:41)
why does it have to be violent because (27:39 - 27:43)
this is the past there's violence (27:41 - 27:46)
everywhere i didn't have to be (27:43 - 27:46)
um (27:48 - 27:51)
this is like the final fantasy problem (27:50 - 27:53)
why would i be on weird deer when i (27:51 - 27:55)
could just be on bravery (27:53 - 27:57)
because ravier is in the air and weird (27:55 - 28:00)
ears on the ground you can't get ground (27:57 - 28:04)
things if you're in the air (28:00 - 28:04)
i'm sure weird deer could swim too if it (28:05 - 28:09)
wanted to (28:06 - 28:11)
it was trying real hard like oh you're (28:09 - 28:13)
saying that you can maybe mine on weird (28:11 - 28:15)
deer maybe yeah (28:13 - 28:17)
or encounter (28:15 - 28:18)
pokemon (28:17 - 28:19)
but if i'm uh (28:18 - 28:21)
let's be honest here we've all played (28:19 - 28:22)
pokemon games there's a certain point (28:21 - 28:23)
where you don't want to encounter (28:22 - 28:25)
anything i just want to get from point a (28:23 - 28:28)
to point b it should be swanna because (28:25 - 28:32)
swanna like ducks are the ultimate (28:28 - 28:36)
animal that can do sky ground and water (28:32 - 28:39)
like very few animals can do all three (28:36 - 28:43)
swan is the true arches (28:39 - 28:43)
um (28:44 - 28:50)
so and i i also wonder if (28:45 - 28:54)
how much control you have for flying (28:50 - 28:56)
on braviary (28:54 - 29:00)
or if it is a situation where (28:56 - 29:02)
when you get to the edge of a zone and (29:00 - 29:05)
you need to transition to the next zone (29:02 - 29:07)
braviary comes to take you to the next (29:05 - 29:09)
one and that's the only really thing you (29:07 - 29:12)
get from braviary (29:09 - 29:14)
that you're going to have sky encounters (29:12 - 29:17)
and it's like bravery takes you within (29:14 - 29:19)
you can fly around within a zone but not (29:17 - 29:21)
across zones (29:19 - 29:22)
maybe (29:21 - 29:24)
they didn't answer that question (29:22 - 29:27)
bravery just hits like a invisible cloud (29:24 - 29:30)
wall yeah exactly you cannot fly any (29:27 - 29:32)
higher in this zone (29:30 - 29:34)
i'm glad they showed like what the game (29:32 - 29:38)
is because i i do think they (29:34 - 29:38)
i do think they really showed their hand (29:39 - 29:45)
of like this is what you're doing and (29:41 - 29:47)
the whole point of a video game trailer (29:45 - 29:48)
or the whole point of what this was (29:47 - 29:50)
called the gameplay preview is like this (29:48 - 29:52)
is what you're buying (29:50 - 29:53)
yeah (29:52 - 29:56)
if you're you're going to jubalife (29:53 - 29:58)
you're getting quests your your main (29:56 - 30:01)
overall goal is to complete the pokedex (29:58 - 30:03)
which involves catching pokemon (30:01 - 30:06)
they've said there is no (30:03 - 30:09)
battling other humans it doesn't even (30:06 - 30:10)
look like there are trainers in this (30:09 - 30:12)
game i'm sure there are (30:10 - 30:15)
but i can't imagine there's just (30:12 - 30:16)
youngster joey hanging out in the middle (30:15 - 30:18)
of the field and you can battle them (30:16 - 30:19)
like (30:18 - 30:21)
maybe maybe but it doesn't look like (30:19 - 30:24)
there's (30:21 - 30:24)
i think (30:24 - 30:27)
maybe they showed like one trainer (30:25 - 30:30)
battle of you battling like uh (30:27 - 30:30)
i feel like given what they've shown and (30:32 - 30:37)
said about the story having existing (30:35 - 30:38)
trainers (30:37 - 30:40)
out in the world (30:38 - 30:42)
feels not what (30:40 - 30:46)
the theme of the game is yeah agree (30:42 - 30:48)
like (30:46 - 30:51)
there may be trainers in the towns but (30:48 - 30:52)
it's definitely got the feel of you're (30:51 - 30:54)
going out and exploring and trying to (30:52 - 30:56)
find these pokemon in the wild and it (30:54 - 30:57)
says in the trailer (30:56 - 30:59)
a time before (30:57 - 31:01)
pokemon and humans really worked (30:59 - 31:02)
together (31:01 - 31:04)
so it would feel (31:02 - 31:06)
very weird to run into people who are (31:04 - 31:08)
like i have seven (31:06 - 31:10)
pokemon pals and we're gonna battle you (31:08 - 31:12)
like that doesn't feel like it fits the (31:10 - 31:16)
theme yeah to me it's more like um (31:12 - 31:18)
i know that they would have an arena in (31:16 - 31:20)
juba life and it's like if you have a (31:18 - 31:22)
pokemon team you can do like an arena (31:20 - 31:26)
quest and select somebody to battle (31:22 - 31:28)
um (31:26 - 31:28)
it doesn't look like there's any (31:31 - 31:35)
breeding of any sort no like daycare for (31:32 - 31:37)
eggs and the only reason i personally (31:35 - 31:38)
don't care (31:37 - 31:40)
but that was like a huge that was a huge (31:38 - 31:41)
complaint for let's go pikachu let's go (31:40 - 31:43)
evie people hung their hat on being very (31:41 - 31:45)
upset that there was no (31:43 - 31:47)
breeding in that game and it's like i (31:45 - 31:50)
get it i get that (31:47 - 31:52)
most main series pokemon games have (31:50 - 31:54)
breeding but i also understand that (31:52 - 31:56)
they're remaking pokemon yellow here (31:54 - 31:58)
the originals didn't have breeding (31:56 - 32:00)
there's only 150 pokemon to begin with (31:58 - 32:01)
what are you going to breed for a (32:00 - 32:03)
geodude you can find a million of those (32:01 - 32:05)
they're very easy to find i and also to (32:03 - 32:07)
be fair (32:05 - 32:10)
uh eggs weren't discovered until modern (32:07 - 32:11)
johto so (32:10 - 32:12)
yep (32:11 - 32:14)
i don't know what you expect there are (32:12 - 32:18)
no eggs they just are there just exist (32:14 - 32:20)
so you you have you have like uh uh we (32:18 - 32:24)
have this game coming out in two weeks (32:20 - 32:25)
it doesn't seem like there's a bunch of (32:24 - 32:26)
trainer battles doesn't seem like (32:25 - 32:28)
there's breeding (32:26 - 32:30)
there obviously there's no gems (32:28 - 32:31)
it seems to be replaced with those (32:30 - 32:33)
nobles (32:31 - 32:34)
so (32:33 - 32:37)
there's no multiplayer besides the fact (32:34 - 32:39)
you can trade other people (32:37 - 32:41)
yep (32:39 - 32:43)
you're completing a pokedex the pokedex (32:41 - 32:45)
that your main goal is to complete a (32:43 - 32:46)
pokedex and they haven't even told us (32:45 - 32:48)
how many pokemon there are that's (32:46 - 32:52)
concerning 250. (32:48 - 32:53)
and (32:52 - 32:55)
they (32:53 - 32:55)
like the whole gameplay loop is go out (32:56 - 33:01)
catch these pokemon some of them are (32:59 - 33:02)
more (33:01 - 33:04)
some of them are stronger than others (33:02 - 33:06)
here are some styles (33:04 - 33:09)
here's some customization (33:06 - 33:11)
and here is what a noble fight looks (33:09 - 33:13)
like (33:11 - 33:16)
and the rather if they're hiding (33:13 - 33:18)
something better (33:16 - 33:20)
that you're but (33:18 - 33:22)
this is like this is almost exactly what (33:20 - 33:23)
monster hunter is and you love monster (33:22 - 33:24)
hunter (33:23 - 33:26)
i'm not i'm not i'm not you just not (33:24 - 33:28)
want monster hunter in your pokemon (33:26 - 33:30)
first off i don't reese's peanut butter (33:28 - 33:32)
cups first of all i don't think this is (33:30 - 33:34)
going to be nearly as good as or as (33:32 - 33:36)
complex or as in depth than that monster (33:34 - 33:41)
hunter is not even close i can see that (33:36 - 33:42)
i i'm just thinking like as a game (33:41 - 33:45)
concept get a quest go out complete the (33:42 - 33:47)
quest bring it back get resources for (33:45 - 33:50)
completing that quest yes (33:47 - 33:51)
no i like that gameplay loop i like it a (33:50 - 33:54)
lot i just don't (33:51 - 33:57)
i and the game looks good i'm excited to (33:54 - 33:59)
play it (33:57 - 34:01)
i i just don't think it's gonna be this (33:59 - 34:03)
breath of the wild game that we're gonna (34:01 - 34:04)
hear about (34:03 - 34:06)
oh no (34:04 - 34:08)
no i agree (34:06 - 34:10)
that's the one in september when you can (34:08 - 34:12)
go when you get a quest you can bring (34:10 - 34:14)
three other pokemon (34:12 - 34:15)
researcher trainers whatever they're (34:14 - 34:17)
going to be called in this game with you (34:15 - 34:20)
yeah and then you all get the book (34:17 - 34:22)
pleases of arceus rise stories exactly (34:20 - 34:25)
no no it's like sun break or whatever (34:22 - 34:26)
it's called (34:25 - 34:28)
um (34:26 - 34:28)
yeah so so even though i'm like (34:30 - 34:34)
even though i'm like i i i'm very (34:32 - 34:36)
excited for the game i i i know i like (34:34 - 34:39)
that gameplay loop for monster hunter (34:36 - 34:42)
if there is something more to this game (34:39 - 34:44)
and they decided not to show it in 13 (34:42 - 34:46)
minutes (34:44 - 34:48)
what they've showed so far what they (34:46 - 34:50)
showed in this 13-minute trailer wasn't (34:48 - 34:52)
anything that (34:50 - 34:53)
they didn't already show they expanded (34:52 - 34:55)
on it a little bit more but if you (34:53 - 34:57)
weren't sold (34:55 - 34:59)
on everything leading up to this trailer (34:57 - 35:01)
and then this trailer came out and you (34:59 - 35:03)
still are not sold i don't know what (35:01 - 35:05)
they would be hiding or holding back to (35:03 - 35:07)
convince somebody that they should get (35:05 - 35:08)
this game i guess that's what i'm trying (35:07 - 35:10)
to say the only thing the way i would (35:08 - 35:11)
put it is the only things that they (35:10 - 35:15)
would be holding back are things that (35:11 - 35:18)
will make the game enjoyable (35:15 - 35:18)
but (35:18 - 35:19)
would (35:18 - 35:22)
also if not interpreted the right way (35:19 - 35:24)
would be a disincentive like what if (35:22 - 35:27)
they said like you know let's put it in (35:24 - 35:28)
a monster hunter framework what if they (35:27 - 35:31)
said like the clothing sets you can get (35:28 - 35:33)
give you buffs towards how you interact (35:31 - 35:35)
with the pokemon in the field (35:33 - 35:37)
and then people got like super like (35:35 - 35:39)
upset because it's like why should my (35:37 - 35:42)
clothes impact how my (35:39 - 35:44)
how i operate when i'm playing the game (35:42 - 35:46)
and then we find out that that's (35:44 - 35:47)
actually really cool because that's (35:46 - 35:51)
that's the fun of monster hunter (35:47 - 35:51)
it was designing those sets that like (35:51 - 35:55)
give you the buffs that you want when (35:53 - 35:57)
you're out in the field right (35:55 - 35:59)
so that could be a disincentive to some (35:57 - 36:01)
people until they start playing and (35:59 - 36:03)
realize how fun that actually is (36:01 - 36:05)
i mean (36:03 - 36:07)
the pokemon company always plays it very (36:05 - 36:08)
very safe (36:07 - 36:11)
yes (36:08 - 36:14)
so they're going to show (36:11 - 36:14)
95 of what you're going to be doing in (36:14 - 36:18)
that game yes (36:17 - 36:21)
so i do not think there is the only (36:18 - 36:23)
thing i think that they are probably not (36:21 - 36:26)
talking about is (36:23 - 36:28)
things that are for like niche market (36:26 - 36:30)
things like (36:28 - 36:31)
shiny (36:30 - 36:34)
pokemon yeah like that matters (36:31 - 36:37)
to a tiny group of people and those (36:34 - 36:39)
group of people who are obsessed with it (36:37 - 36:40)
are gonna buy the game anyway so there's (36:39 - 36:42)
no point in putting them in the trailer (36:40 - 36:43)
um (36:42 - 36:46)
they're going to keep new forms hidden (36:43 - 36:48)
because they like those to be surprises (36:46 - 36:49)
in the game (36:48 - 36:51)
yeah so if there are new forms if (36:49 - 36:53)
there's new pokemon i mean they've (36:51 - 36:55)
hidden arcanine from us they've hidden (36:53 - 36:57)
electrode from us (36:55 - 37:00)
they've hidden a lot of things so (36:57 - 37:01)
i think (37:00 - 37:05)
the gameplay trailer is exactly what it (37:01 - 37:09)
said it is this is how you play the game (37:05 - 37:11)
period (37:09 - 37:13)
and yeah and like they did like i think (37:11 - 37:15)
they did a really good job of (37:13 - 37:17)
uh giving the example of the quest (37:15 - 37:20)
system it's like you you see somebody in (37:17 - 37:22)
town that person says i want to see what (37:20 - 37:25)
shinx's ears look like then you go out (37:22 - 37:28)
catch a shanks bring it back show it to (37:25 - 37:29)
that person there's a cute little (37:28 - 37:32)
animation of the shakes turning around (37:29 - 37:34)
so you can see his ears and he's like oh (37:32 - 37:36)
boy that's what the ears look like yeah (37:34 - 37:38)
and that was the other one they had it (37:36 - 37:39)
was like something it's like i don't (37:38 - 37:41)
think pokemon can be different sizes so (37:39 - 37:44)
it's like you want to catch a bunch of (37:41 - 37:46)
one type of pokemon and (37:44 - 37:48)
also they showed at least in jubalife (37:46 - 37:50)
city you have access to everything (37:48 - 37:53)
that's in your party and in the pasture (37:50 - 37:57)
because it opens the menu to say like (37:53 - 37:58)
you know pull from here or pull from (37:57 - 38:01)
here my question is and it probably (37:58 - 38:03)
doesn't matter to gameplay is do you (38:01 - 38:06)
have access to the pasture (38:03 - 38:09)
outside of the field when you're in the (38:06 - 38:11)
field (38:09 - 38:13)
like is this up the the box goes with (38:11 - 38:16)
you wherever you go sort of situation (38:13 - 38:18)
i also greatly appreciated that they (38:16 - 38:20)
said that the ark phone was mysterious (38:18 - 38:23)
mysterious yeah the mysterious right (38:20 - 38:25)
mysterious (38:23 - 38:25)
i also don't understand the cleaver (38:27 - 38:31)
battle they show because they show much (38:29 - 38:34)
more of the cleaver battle yeah (38:31 - 38:36)
and (38:34 - 38:36)
i guess as like as as a pokemon trainer (38:38 - 38:42)
why (38:43 - 38:46)
am i throwing ramen packets at cleaver i (38:44 - 38:50)
mean it's just food that it likes (38:46 - 38:52)
yeah it says it throws bomb it's its (38:50 - 38:54)
favorite food yep yeah it can be (38:52 - 38:56)
unlimited (38:54 - 38:58)
it will calm it down (38:56 - 39:00)
what what does it make sense to me (38:58 - 39:02)
thematically (39:00 - 39:04)
is in every single pokemon game (39:02 - 39:06)
you go walk into the grass and then you (39:04 - 39:08)
get yelled at that the grass is (39:06 - 39:10)
dangerous and you need a pokemon there (39:08 - 39:12)
to protect you (39:10 - 39:14)
and this is the opposite we didn't know (39:12 - 39:16)
that yeah didn't know that this is a (39:14 - 39:18)
brave new world we don't know how (39:16 - 39:19)
dangerous the grass is it's a very (39:18 - 39:21)
chicken in the egg question it's like (39:19 - 39:23)
who was the person who threw the first (39:21 - 39:25)
pokeball no people had to be walking in (39:23 - 39:27)
that grass getting attacked first before (39:25 - 39:29)
they developed a method for (39:27 - 39:30)
ameliorating that (39:29 - 39:33)
danger (39:30 - 39:33)
also you're 10 years old you just you're (39:34 - 39:38)
not you don't know about stealth you (39:36 - 39:41)
just blindly wondering the girl gets (39:38 - 39:43)
sliced by this cleaver and she's blowing (39:41 - 39:46)
red (39:43 - 39:46)
and then eventually she brings out her s (39:46 - 39:50)
sidearm (39:49 - 39:51)
side actually brings out psyduck yeah (39:50 - 39:53)
what so (39:51 - 39:55)
the way it seems to be from what they (39:53 - 39:58)
showed is you run around throwing bombs (39:55 - 40:00)
until it calms down enough for an (39:58 - 40:03)
opening where you can actually (40:00 - 40:05)
battle it to weaken it and then (40:03 - 40:06)
that (40:05 - 40:08)
window will close and then you have to (40:06 - 40:10)
go back to ramen packets until it calms (40:08 - 40:12)
down again because it kept saying that (40:10 - 40:15)
there would be breaks i so the i saw it (40:12 - 40:16)
the opposite and you could see at the (40:15 - 40:18)
top of the screen there was like four (40:16 - 40:20)
like a four segmented yellow thing yeah (40:18 - 40:22)
and for me (40:20 - 40:23)
was (40:22 - 40:25)
battle it until it hits one of those (40:23 - 40:28)
segments then it will lower its guard (40:25 - 40:30)
that's when you throw the bomb uh i (40:28 - 40:32)
thought the other way that you throw the (40:30 - 40:33)
bomb to comet until it's one of those (40:32 - 40:35)
segments and that's when you can battle (40:33 - 40:37)
it because they said you have did (40:35 - 40:38)
there'll be moments when it lowers his (40:37 - 40:41)
defenses she was throwing the bombs (40:38 - 40:44)
and then it changed over health part and (40:41 - 40:47)
then she threw out the pokemon (40:44 - 40:50)
i would look at that again (40:47 - 40:50)
it's gonna be fun i'm gonna have a fun (40:56 - 41:00)
good time (40:57 - 41:00)
i don't know she like uses so like (41:04 - 41:08)
so i just i just rewatched it back so um (41:09 - 41:14)
she's strong styles (41:12 - 41:17)
psyduck water guns it and it takes like (41:14 - 41:19)
90 of its hp (41:17 - 41:22)
it uses stealth rock (41:19 - 41:24)
psyduck has (41:22 - 41:26)
like two hp left (41:24 - 41:28)
zydec uses water pulse (41:26 - 41:29)
which (41:28 - 41:30)
if strong style is supposed to make you (41:29 - 41:33)
like go slower (41:30 - 41:34)
it's (41:33 - 41:37)
it went next so i'm assuming the stealth (41:34 - 41:38)
rock was also strong style that's why it (41:37 - 41:40)
did damage so they both use strong (41:38 - 41:42)
styled moves (41:40 - 41:44)
she uses water pulse water pulse knocks (41:42 - 41:48)
it out and then so now cleaver has no hp (41:44 - 41:50)
and it says cleaver let its guard down (41:48 - 41:53)
now is your chance to throw bombs (41:50 - 41:56)
and now it's (41:53 - 41:59)
now is so it goes back to its overall it (41:56 - 42:01)
goes back to the huge bar and the huge (41:59 - 42:06)
bar has it at 75 percent (42:01 - 42:08)
and so now she's throwing bombs and it's (42:06 - 42:10)
bringing it down to 50 percent (42:08 - 42:12)
now it's down to 40 percent but cydex (42:10 - 42:15)
gone and then the trailer ends (42:12 - 42:17)
so psyduck does officially knock out (42:15 - 42:19)
cleaver (42:17 - 42:22)
but its hp is different than the (42:19 - 42:26)
bar at the top (42:22 - 42:26)
so i don't know (42:34 - 42:40)
it it seems fine i guess (42:36 - 42:40)
i mean it's more actiony eventually (42:41 - 42:45)
[Music] (42:44 - 42:46)
yeah (42:45 - 42:49)
so i mean the trailer starts the battle (42:46 - 42:52)
starts with that yellow bar full and (42:49 - 42:53)
she's running around trying to throw (42:52 - 42:56)
bombs on it (42:53 - 42:56)
so you bomb it you pokemon battle it you (42:59 - 43:03)
beat the battle but that takes a huge (43:02 - 43:06)
chunk out of the top bar you bomb it (43:03 - 43:07)
again you probably have to do it it's a (43:06 - 43:09)
it's a video game trope you probably (43:07 - 43:12)
have to do it three times (43:09 - 43:12)
this could just be like a one-off game (43:24 - 43:29)
something they're trying (43:26 - 43:29)
or like let's go pikachu let's go eevee (43:29 - 43:34)
doesn't seem like it's it's this ongoing (43:31 - 43:36)
series it was like something they tried (43:34 - 43:37)
well i mean (43:36 - 43:40)
when i was on the market thinking was it (43:37 - 43:43)
could be similar to um (43:40 - 43:44)
what is it like (43:43 - 43:46)
you have with like zelda where you have (43:44 - 43:48)
the one game where it's just like kill (43:46 - 43:51)
like constantly fighting lots of hordes (43:48 - 43:53)
and everything and that's just not a (43:51 - 43:56)
regular oh hyrule warrior high reward so (43:53 - 43:58)
this could be like you have like the (43:56 - 44:00)
pokemon legends games which are this (43:58 - 44:03)
type and then the pokemon (44:00 - 44:04)
maybe they'll add a name to it like (44:03 - 44:06)
which is the traditional (44:04 - 44:08)
story adventure and then you'll have (44:06 - 44:12)
battle arena which is (44:08 - 44:13)
which you can take your pokemon from (44:12 - 44:15)
either one that you catch and transfer (44:13 - 44:17)
them into battle arena for the (44:15 - 44:19)
competitive market (44:17 - 44:22)
and now we're selling like yeah eight (44:19 - 44:24)
games a year yeah (44:22 - 44:26)
win win win (44:24 - 44:26)
i wonder if this was (44:29 - 44:33)
so you know how game freak has what's (44:32 - 44:37)
called the uh what do they call that the (44:33 - 44:40)
something project gear gear project (44:37 - 44:42)
games (44:40 - 44:42)
and little town hero was a gear project (44:42 - 44:46)
and tembo the elephant was a gear (44:44 - 44:49)
project and great game (44:46 - 44:53)
i wonder if this was a gear project game (44:49 - 44:55)
and they were like (44:53 - 44:58)
you know tembo and little town hero and (44:55 - 44:59)
all this other stuff (44:58 - 45:02)
sold like garbage and no one bought it (44:59 - 45:05)
pocket jackie pocket card jockey was so (45:02 - 45:09)
good best game freak game um (45:05 - 45:09)
and they were like let's just slap (45:09 - 45:14)
pokemon on here (45:10 - 45:14)
uh i mean it was i i imagine the idea (45:18 - 45:23)
was sure (45:21 - 45:25)
but then they're like because it feels (45:23 - 45:26)
like if (45:25 - 45:28)
less like let's just slap it on there if (45:26 - 45:30)
they're going to introduce new pokemon (45:28 - 45:32)
types (45:30 - 45:34)
yeah i i guess we don't know how long (45:32 - 45:36)
this has been in development for either (45:34 - 45:37)
yeah (45:36 - 45:39)
like did they start did the team that (45:37 - 45:41)
did they start this after they finished (45:39 - 45:43)
little town hero did they start this as (45:41 - 45:47)
soon as sword shield was done (45:43 - 45:47)
when did they (45:49 - 45:52)
ask ilka to start making brilliant (45:50 - 45:55)
diamond shining pearl (45:52 - 45:59)
we will never know (45:55 - 45:59)
it looks good it looks good my like i (46:05 - 46:10)
said my only my my main concern here is (46:07 - 46:13)
it's going to be (46:10 - 46:13)
a relatively short experience (46:13 - 46:18)
but i don't think that's bad (46:17 - 46:20)
i mean pokemon quest was a pretty short (46:18 - 46:22)
experience and i love that game (46:20 - 46:24)
uh (46:22 - 46:27)
i have a feeling it (46:24 - 46:30)
judging by the previous thing (46:27 - 46:31)
that they did that had regions that (46:30 - 46:33)
unlocked and reasons to go back into (46:31 - 46:37)
them which was the new snap (46:33 - 46:38)
i have a feeling (46:37 - 46:40)
that this is going to be a longer game (46:38 - 46:42)
than we're giving credit for it (46:40 - 46:44)
yeah i mean that would be nice it'd be (46:42 - 46:45)
nice to be wrong on that you know (46:44 - 46:46)
everyone (46:45 - 46:48)
we we all three of us thought snap was (46:46 - 46:50)
going to be relatively short and (46:48 - 46:53)
so i i don't snap was long if you liked (46:50 - 46:55)
the gameplay luke right if you have a (46:53 - 46:57)
few you just wanted to see the credits (46:55 - 46:59)
snap was actually relatively short i (46:57 - 47:00)
think it's going to be the same here if (46:59 - 47:02)
you just want to follow the story line (47:00 - 47:03)
through it's a short game but if you (47:02 - 47:05)
want to do a bunch of the side quests if (47:03 - 47:06)
you really enjoy (47:05 - 47:08)
doing the game and going out and (47:06 - 47:10)
collecting resources and finding things (47:08 - 47:12)
for people it's going to be a much (47:10 - 47:15)
longer game i've i i have i get a very (47:12 - 47:18)
strong snap vibe from how this game is (47:15 - 47:21)
created and laid out (47:18 - 47:21)
i agree (47:21 - 47:24)
all right let's take a break when we (47:25 - 47:29)
come back we're going to talk about um (47:26 - 47:31)
some police officers getting arrested (47:29 - 47:32)
for (47:31 - 47:34)
playing no not arrested but yeah and (47:32 - 47:36)
arrested (47:34 - 47:39)
we will be right back (47:36 - 47:42)
[Music] (47:39 - 47:42)
this is the year of miraculous (47:45 - 47:50)
[Applause] (47:47 - 47:50)
[Music] (47:55 - 48:00)
[Applause] (47:57 - 48:00)
[Music] (48:01 - 48:04)
some could argue that 2019 is the year (48:05 - 48:10)
of practice (48:07 - 48:10)
[Music] (48:14 - 48:19)
and we are back (48:29 - 48:32)
uh (48:31 - 48:34)
all right (48:32 - 48:36)
a million people sent me this over the (48:34 - 48:38)
last week (48:36 - 48:38)
uh this is off the verge.com lapd (48:40 - 48:45)
officers fired for catching a snorlax (48:43 - 48:48)
instead of a burglar denial appeal (48:45 - 48:50)
denied appeal (48:48 - 48:54)
[Laughter] (48:50 - 48:57)
squad car recordings caught the officers (48:54 - 48:59)
playing pokemon go instead of responding (48:57 - 49:02)
for a request for backup (48:59 - 49:05)
two lapd officers who were fired from (49:02 - 49:08)
their jobs in 2017 for playing go while (49:05 - 49:10)
on duty have appealed their (49:08 - 49:13)
reinstatement denied by a california (49:10 - 49:14)
judge (49:13 - 49:17)
the two officers squad car the officer (49:14 - 49:20)
squad car video camera showed the two (49:17 - 49:21)
officers (49:20 - 49:23)
uh will ignore their names ignored a (49:21 - 49:25)
request for backup (49:23 - 49:27)
backup to play the game according to (49:25 - 49:29)
court documents the pair were stationed (49:27 - 49:31)
near robbery in progress (49:29 - 49:33)
and after responding the officers put (49:31 - 49:35)
out a call for backup (49:33 - 49:37)
two officers ignored the call and left (49:35 - 49:39)
the area when asked later why they (49:37 - 49:41)
didn't respond to the call the two (49:39 - 49:43)
officers said they were in a loud area (49:41 - 49:45)
couldn't hear the radio (49:43 - 49:46)
supervisors were skeptical of their (49:45 - 49:49)
explanation checking the car in the in (49:46 - 49:52)
car recording system known as the (49:49 - 49:54)
commonly known as a dash cam (49:52 - 49:56)
which revealed the two heard the call (49:54 - 49:57)
and chose to go elsewhere as they didn't (49:56 - 50:00)
want to help the supervisor reported the (49:57 - 50:02)
incident which opened a formal (50:00 - 50:04)
investigation (50:02 - 50:06)
after it went to court an intensive (50:04 - 50:08)
review and the in-car video system (50:06 - 50:10)
revealed that shortly after leaving the (50:08 - 50:12)
scene the two officers could be here (50:10 - 50:14)
discussing pokemon go including a (50:12 - 50:16)
snorlax that appeared and the best route (50:14 - 50:18)
to intercept to catch it (50:16 - 50:20)
for approximately 20 minutes in the (50:18 - 50:24)
in-car video system captured (50:20 - 50:24)
they (50:24 - 50:27)
saw the officers discussing pokemon as (50:25 - 50:29)
they drove to different locations where (50:27 - 50:31)
where the virtual creatures apparently (50:29 - 50:33)
appeared on the phone when confronted (50:31 - 50:35)
the officers denied they were playing go (50:33 - 50:36)
and said they were just having a (50:35 - 50:39)
conversation (50:36 - 50:39)
um that's pretty much it yeah snorlax (50:40 - 50:45)
you snore it's really loud and you can't (50:43 - 50:47)
hear the radio over snorlax snoring (50:45 - 50:49)
clearly (50:47 - 50:52)
uh until so i i saw the headline and i (50:49 - 50:54)
saw that this was trending on twitter as (50:52 - 50:55)
well (50:54 - 50:57)
snorlax the word snorlax was trending on (50:55 - 51:00)
twitter for a whole day (50:57 - 51:01)
and (51:00 - 51:04)
i didn't realize that this was a um and (51:01 - 51:05)
i'm sure people listening to the show (51:04 - 51:06)
who probably didn't read any of the (51:05 - 51:09)
articles and just read headlines (51:06 - 51:11)
didn't realize that this was from 2017 (51:09 - 51:14)
and that their case just went yeah deals (51:11 - 51:15)
yeah (51:14 - 51:17)
well that's yeah (51:15 - 51:19)
it did become public until (51:17 - 51:21)
like court records which are public (51:19 - 51:23)
could then be (51:21 - 51:24)
right (51:23 - 51:27)
right you don't discuss litigation (51:24 - 51:30)
until like the case is closed and then (51:27 - 51:32)
it becomes a matter of public record so (51:30 - 51:34)
this this whole case just went public (51:32 - 51:36)
this week that's why yeah that's why (51:34 - 51:38)
like it it came it can't delay because (51:36 - 51:41)
they had their appeal denied (51:38 - 51:43)
case closed done yeah because who (51:41 - 51:45)
doesn't have a snorlax at this point (51:43 - 51:47)
right come on i'll trade you one dude (51:45 - 51:49)

pokemon news here uh the softbookman.com (52:57 - 53:02)
pokemon unite january 2022 producer (52:59 - 53:03)
letter (53:02 - 53:06)
um revealed in the new producer level (53:03 - 53:08)
among information some exciting news for (53:06 - 53:10)
pokemon unite we'll be joining the (53:08 - 53:13)
pokemon world championships in 2022 (53:10 - 53:15)
soon teams around the globe will be able (53:13 - 53:17)
to put their pokemon unite skills into a (53:15 - 53:18)
test over the competitive season (53:17 - 53:20)
qualifying teams will make it to the (53:18 - 53:22)
pokemon world championship in august to (53:20 - 53:25)
participate for the world title (53:22 - 53:27)
uh (53:25 - 53:31)
they also added trevident (53:27 - 53:33)
or treven is coming to the game as a (53:31 - 53:34)
playable character (53:33 - 53:36)
that'll be interesting to see a tree (53:34 - 53:38)
running around yeah (53:36 - 53:42)
also i think the big thing is (53:38 - 53:44)
that they're adding (53:42 - 53:48)
what are they calling it tournament mode (53:44 - 53:48)
uh yeah yeah (53:49 - 53:53)
um the other thing they're adding is (53:51 - 53:55)
more languages (53:53 - 53:58)
uh unite will support uh brazilian (53:55 - 54:00)
portuguese hindi russian turkish a (53:58 - 54:03)
couple other languages here (54:00 - 54:07)
okay it's actually brazilian portuguese (54:03 - 54:08)
it does say brazilian portuguese yes (54:07 - 54:10)
there is no comment between yeah (54:08 - 54:13)
got it yeah (54:10 - 54:13)
and (54:13 - 54:16)
the big thing about tournament mode is (54:13 - 54:18)
uh it will even the playing field (54:16 - 54:20)
competitors regardless of their held (54:18 - 54:24)
item grades (54:20 - 54:24)
people who are um yeah you know unites a (54:31 - 54:37)
game (54:34 - 54:37)
i would i wonder if (54:42 - 54:46)
watching (54:50 - 54:53)
if people had an opportunity to watch (54:53 - 54:57)
unite at a high skill level they would (54:55 - 54:59)
be more likely to get in (54:57 - 55:01)
and the reason i say that is i remember (54:59 - 55:02)
taking (55:01 - 55:03)
a (55:02 - 55:06)
non-pokemon fan (55:03 - 55:06)
to (55:06 - 55:09)
the california world (55:06 - 55:11)
tournament (55:09 - 55:14)
they didn't know too much about pokemon (55:11 - 55:15)
they were just re they really wanted to (55:14 - 55:18)
go to california i was like looking to (55:15 - 55:20)
you know split a room with somebody in (55:18 - 55:21)
california (55:20 - 55:24)
they went to the world championship they (55:21 - 55:26)
they ended up watching (55:24 - 55:29)
at the time that was black and white (55:26 - 55:30)
they ended up watching the black and (55:29 - 55:32)
white vgc (55:30 - 55:34)
stuff live there (55:32 - 55:36)
and literally after that tournament that (55:34 - 55:37)
after that weekend they ended up buying (55:36 - 55:40)
it 3ds for the first time (55:37 - 55:43)
buying a copy of (55:40 - 55:45)
um no was it black and white it might (55:43 - 55:48)
have been black and white (55:45 - 55:50)
a copy of pokemon getting into the card (55:48 - 55:51)
game (55:50 - 55:53)
so i wonder if i i (55:51 - 55:55)
i wonder if like this is what unite (55:53 - 55:58)
needs just to be like featured (55:55 - 56:01)
on like the main stage (55:58 - 56:03)
uh i think it needs millions of dollars (56:01 - 56:05)
of prizes behind it (56:03 - 56:06)
that's what drives people these days do (56:05 - 56:08)
you think people play league of legends (56:06 - 56:09)
because they enjoy it no they play (56:08 - 56:10)
league of legends because they think (56:09 - 56:11)
they're going to make millions of (56:10 - 56:15)
dollars off of it (56:11 - 56:15)
i mean united is free and it's on ios (56:18 - 56:23)
and android and switch (56:21 - 56:25)
so besides marketing it if people aren't (56:23 - 56:27)
playing it i don't know what else to (56:25 - 56:30)
tell you (56:27 - 56:30)
probably hasn't even played it recently (56:30 - 56:34)
what (56:32 - 56:36)
was the last time you played unite (56:34 - 56:38)
halloween (56:36 - 56:40)
really so you didn't do any of the (56:38 - 56:41)
winter stuff nah (56:40 - 56:43)
well because i had a friend who said we (56:41 - 56:44)
were going to play together and he i (56:43 - 56:48)
heard this story before (56:44 - 56:50)
and i got so bitter and you act like i (56:48 - 56:52)
played without you (56:50 - 56:54)
i got so bitter and heartbroken that i (56:52 - 56:55)
just couldn't i can't i couldn't even (56:54 - 56:57)
look at the game (56:55 - 56:58)
are you telling me there was no one else (56:57 - 57:01)
you play unite with (56:58 - 57:01)
no (57:03 - 57:06)
just me (57:04 - 57:06)
no there were i mean here's the thing (57:08 - 57:14)
every time i think (57:11 - 57:14)
oh maybe i'll play unite (57:14 - 57:20)
i get slightly tired (57:17 - 57:22)
like (57:20 - 57:22)
there's going to be a lot of very (57:23 - 57:28)
frustrating maps matches and unless i (57:25 - 57:30)
know for sure somebody that i want to (57:28 - 57:32)
play with is on and i'm getting on at (57:30 - 57:34)
the same time that they are (57:32 - 57:35)
um (57:34 - 57:37)
it's just sort of hard to get plus i (57:35 - 57:39)
have i've had a (57:37 - 57:41)
much larger game that ate up all of my (57:39 - 57:43)
december so (57:41 - 57:45)
it wasn't even like (57:43 - 57:47)
a conscious decision not to play (57:45 - 57:49)
[Music] (57:47 - 57:51)
unite it was just (57:49 - 57:53)
i have a better game that i have to sit (57:51 - 57:56)
in a 3000 q for (57:53 - 57:57)
so (57:56 - 57:59)
i'm going to load that up (57:57 - 58:01)
and then watch tick tock on my phone (57:59 - 58:04)
while i sit in queue (58:01 - 58:04)
i (58:05 - 58:09)
no pokemon go news this week that we (58:07 - 58:11)
didn't really cover i mean classic (58:09 - 58:13)
community days is (58:11 - 58:14)

it it wants me he says hey you took a (58:37 - 58:40)
bunch of steps today i'm like yeah yeah (58:38 - 58:42)
whatever i have a bunch of pikmin that (58:40 - 58:44)
are currently (58:42 - 58:46)
on their way from honolulu (58:44 - 58:48)
to saint paul (58:46 - 58:50)
i also have a bunch of open that i have (58:48 - 58:52)
sent from here (58:50 - 58:56)
back to hawaii i hope they are able to (58:52 - 58:59)
breathe in water or you just doomed all (58:56 - 59:01)
your pikmin it's very interesting (58:59 - 59:04)
when you check on their travel they uh (59:01 - 59:07)
it shows us grass underneath them (59:04 - 59:08)
so (59:07 - 59:10)
they've they're making their own (59:08 - 59:12)
generate uh islands underneath their own (59:10 - 59:14)
feet (59:12 - 59:16)
pikmin are amazing (59:14 - 59:20)
greg question of the week uh (59:16 - 59:23)
okay hold on question of the week (59:20 - 59:24)
[Music] (59:23 - 59:27)
question of the week (59:24 - 59:27)
question of the week (59:28 - 59:31)
this is from alex what (59:32 - 59:36)
of the announcement features of legends (59:34 - 59:40)
arceus can make or break the game (59:36 - 59:40)
it's a tough question (59:42 - 59:46)
i mean i think crafting can always make (59:44 - 59:48)
or break a game true (59:46 - 59:50)
um (59:48 - 59:50)
we didn't talk about this but (59:52 - 59:56)
they did show that there was like uh (59:54 - 59:59)
bulk crafting in legends (59:56 - 60:01)
where you could make yeah five pokeballs (59:59 - 60:04)
at once and that was something that (60:01 - 60:07)
animal crossing new horizons did not (60:04 - 60:08)
have like if you wanted to make (60:07 - 60:10)
fish bait in animal crossing you were (60:08 - 60:14)
making it one one at a time (60:10 - 60:16)
uh bulk crafting is good um i'm trying (60:14 - 60:17)
to think (60:16 - 60:20)
i mean i think my biggest (60:17 - 60:22)
concern (60:20 - 60:24)
is how (60:22 - 60:26)
good the sneaking system is (60:24 - 60:31)
right um like if (60:26 - 60:33)
if that whole (60:31 - 60:36)
getting close to pokemon (60:33 - 60:38)
is super annoying (60:36 - 60:41)
uh no matter what route you have to take (60:38 - 60:45)
that like that is a game breaker for me (60:41 - 60:45)
i think if the only pokemon evol (60:47 - 60:52)
available in the game are the ones like (60:49 - 60:54)
the the new forms (60:52 - 60:56)
float soul or weasel i don't remember (60:54 - 60:58)
which was in the video and shanks that's (60:56 - 61:01)
going to be disappointing (60:58 - 61:03)
because it was like the only ones we've (61:01 - 61:05)
seen oh wait we've seen uh a psyduck (61:03 - 61:07)
yeah i mean pokemon selection right (61:05 - 61:11)
which pokemon are available is a big uh (61:07 - 61:14)
big detail for people (61:11 - 61:14)
well crafting solid i think that i think (61:20 - 61:25)
the character customization looks good (61:22 - 61:26)
yeah (61:25 - 61:27)
um (61:26 - 61:28)
i mean i should have character (61:27 - 61:31)
organization can always be better but it (61:28 - 61:33)
looks like this is as good this is (61:31 - 61:35)
better than (61:33 - 61:37)
sun and moon and (61:35 - 61:39)
let's go and diamond and pearl don't (61:37 - 61:41)
know if it'll be better than (61:39 - 61:43)
sword and shield but see that's also a (61:41 - 61:44)
make and break for me because there have (61:43 - 61:46)
been games where i spent two hours on (61:44 - 61:47)
character customization and then i (61:46 - 61:48)
started playing because it was like (61:47 - 61:50)
really complicated and right then i (61:48 - 61:52)
started playing the game and i was like (61:50 - 61:53)
i hate this game (61:52 - 61:55)
i have a fantastic looking character (61:53 - 61:57)
that is (61:55 - 62:00)
this game i don't want him in this world (61:57 - 62:00)
um (62:02 - 62:06)
i try to think of anything else they (62:04 - 62:07)
showed uh i mean i'm (62:06 - 62:10)
[Music] (62:07 - 62:12)
concerned about (62:10 - 62:15)
how potentially frustrating noble (62:12 - 62:17)
battles might be (62:15 - 62:20)
like if it's a thing where the pattern (62:17 - 62:22)
or (62:20 - 62:22)
what you have to do is (62:23 - 62:27)
super not obvious and just super (62:25 - 62:29)
frustrating like that is a surefire way (62:27 - 62:32)
to get me to stop playing that game like (62:29 - 62:34)
if i can't i don't mind having to figure (62:32 - 62:38)
things out but if it is (62:34 - 62:38)
so incredibly (62:39 - 62:44)
difficult or it's absolutely (62:40 - 62:48)
100 like dexterity based like (62:44 - 62:50)
you have to be so twitchy on your (62:48 - 62:52)
control that that could turn me off of (62:50 - 62:54)
this so quick one thing about because i (62:52 - 62:56)
was worried about dexterity too um one (62:54 - 62:58)
thing to notice in the screenshot is (62:56 - 63:01)
that they say zl to focus which to me (62:58 - 63:06)
says like zl for assisted aiming (63:01 - 63:06)
so it's not super dexterity it's more (63:07 - 63:10)
time yeah i'm just wondering like (63:09 - 63:13)
because you have to dodge out of attacks (63:10 - 63:14)
but there's also a button to dodge it's (63:13 - 63:17)
not like you have to like (63:14 - 63:18)
right i think it's like press the button (63:17 - 63:21)
you dodge so do your timing (63:18 - 63:22)
i'm sure there's like advanced controls (63:21 - 63:24)
of (63:22 - 63:27)
auto dodges or (63:24 - 63:27)
auto aim or whatever (63:28 - 63:31)
maybe (63:32 - 63:36)
we will see i mean that could ruin the (63:34 - 63:39)
game right (63:36 - 63:39)
this is off our youtube this is from (63:40 - 63:44)
cookie kingler question of the week if (63:42 - 63:46)
you were to update the egg breeding (63:44 - 63:50)
system what would you do to it (63:46 - 63:50)
i would make it so that the pokemon that (63:54 - 63:57)
comes out could either be mother or (63:56 - 63:59)
father (63:57 - 64:02)
and have that randomized (63:59 - 64:02)
oh instead of the mother always yeah oh (64:04 - 64:08)
yeah (64:06 - 64:08)
um yeah i think i (64:11 - 64:15)
i do have a lot of problems with the egg (64:13 - 64:16)
and breeding system only because it's (64:15 - 64:19)
been the same for so long i mean they've (64:16 - 64:22)
done minor things over the years of (64:19 - 64:24)
like (64:22 - 64:26)
passing down the ball (64:24 - 64:26)
and (64:26 - 64:28)
[Music] (64:26 - 64:30)
i get to select what ball it goes into (64:28 - 64:33)
oh please (64:30 - 64:35)
leave the extra balls at the daycare if (64:33 - 64:37)
an egg comes out let's put it with this (64:35 - 64:40)
ball okay good the egg move stuff (64:37 - 64:42)
they've they've done (64:40 - 64:44)
i (64:42 - 64:45)
think about how much (64:44 - 64:47)
what are your main problems with (64:45 - 64:50)
breeding just how long it takes (64:47 - 64:53)
how i've been doing the same thing for (64:50 - 64:55)
10 plus years i mean humanity's been (64:53 - 64:56)
doing the same thing for billions of (64:55 - 65:01)
years so so is the animal kingdom so (64:56 - 65:01)
like (65:01 - 65:04)
what about that apart from the fact that (65:02 - 65:06)
it's been the same which is you put two (65:04 - 65:10)
things together and an egg appears (65:06 - 65:10)
um i think it i i will i will say it (65:11 - 65:16)
takes too long in the sense of like (65:14 - 65:18)
waiting for five eggs to hatch and then (65:16 - 65:20)
watching each animation (65:18 - 65:24)
just seems like a waste of time (65:20 - 65:25)
if anything (65:24 - 65:27)
just let me see all five eggs hatch at (65:25 - 65:29)
the same time (65:27 - 65:31)
just put them all next to each other (65:29 - 65:33)
that would be nice (65:31 - 65:34)
um (65:33 - 65:35)
i (65:34 - 65:37)
i think at this point in the stage the (65:35 - 65:39)
step the (65:37 - 65:42)
random step requirements (65:39 - 65:44)
are (65:42 - 65:44)
pointless (65:44 - 65:47)
actually (65:46 - 65:48)
oh that some eggs take longer than (65:47 - 65:51)
others yeah (65:48 - 65:52)
i just thought of something (65:51 - 65:55)
that's based on what steve just said (65:52 - 65:55)
that (65:55 - 65:57)
because i i don't really have any (65:55 - 65:58)
frustrations with the egg system right (65:57 - 66:01)
now i'm perfectly fine with it except (65:58 - 66:04)
that i have to stop and talk to ev (66:01 - 66:06)
somebody to get a new egg (66:04 - 66:08)
each time (66:06 - 66:11)
i wish they could just like hey you had (66:08 - 66:13)
eight eggs generate while you were (66:11 - 66:17)
walking around come get all eight yeah (66:13 - 66:19)
the the conversation of do you really (66:17 - 66:21)
want the egg are you sure you want it (66:19 - 66:23)
exactly yes (66:21 - 66:26)
yes i've been biking in front of you for (66:23 - 66:28)
48 hours (66:26 - 66:30)
every time i've picked up the egg yeah i (66:28 - 66:32)
want the egg oh see now we've gone down (66:30 - 66:34)
this awful path because now i'm like (66:32 - 66:36)
could we have a system where somebody (66:34 - 66:37)
like (66:36 - 66:39)
like not only i can stockpile eggs but (66:37 - 66:41)
then somebody can smell the egg and say (66:39 - 66:42)
oh (66:41 - 66:44)
this one smells like it has really great (66:42 - 66:46)
ivs so we don't have to go through the (66:44 - 66:49)
process of hatching (66:46 - 66:51)
and then find out it was a garbage (66:49 - 66:54)
pokemon i mean the thing that i (66:51 - 66:58)
having done it the old way and honestly (66:54 - 66:59)
um (66:58 - 67:03)
item-wise what i would like to see is (66:59 - 67:05)
let's say (67:03 - 67:05)
like we have the destiny knot (67:06 - 67:11)
issue that brings him down (67:09 - 67:13)
i would like to say like let's say you (67:11 - 67:16)
have a golden bottle cap and you have (67:13 - 67:17)
one of them hold the golden bottle cap (67:16 - 67:21)
and that guarantees (67:17 - 67:21)
six perfect ivs like you have to find a (67:21 - 67:24)
golden bottle cap which is at the end of (67:23 - 67:26)
the game (67:24 - 67:28)
you have one of them hold it and it just (67:26 - 67:31)
fixes the iv problem or (67:28 - 67:32)
not even that have (67:31 - 67:35)
let's say musical instruments (67:32 - 67:37)
and like if you hold this musical in (67:35 - 67:40)
from instrument it will like give you (67:37 - 67:43)
these five ivs as perfect (67:40 - 67:45)
if you hold because you don't always (67:43 - 67:47)
want six perfect right sometimes you (67:45 - 67:50)
want one to not be so bueno and just (67:47 - 67:52)
like you select what instrument it holds (67:50 - 67:55)
and that's what ivs but like but if you (67:52 - 67:59)
could make one with six perfect and then (67:55 - 68:01)
drop back to the five (67:59 - 68:05)
not one like it cuts out so much of that (68:01 - 68:07)
build up time yeah it also stops like (68:05 - 68:11)
let's hack in six iv perfect dittos (68:07 - 68:13)
like if you can just guarantee that one (68:11 - 68:15)
of the children is gonna come out with (68:13 - 68:17)
six perfect ivs (68:15 - 68:20)
by putting on a bottle cap and then (68:17 - 68:22)
going from there i think the biggest (68:20 - 68:23)
issue (68:22 - 68:25)
that i have with breeding isn't the (68:23 - 68:28)
mechanics it's fine it's how they work (68:25 - 68:32)
is that it takes so long to build up and (68:28 - 68:34)
it is it is still one of the areas where (68:32 - 68:36)
people (68:34 - 68:40)
look at it and think it's faster to hack (68:36 - 68:42)
than to do this the old way (68:40 - 68:44)
so if there's a way to cut that out if (68:42 - 68:47)
there's a way to guarantee the ivs were (68:44 - 68:48)
all (68:47 - 68:51)
at 31s i think that would make breeding (68:48 - 68:52)
a (68:51 - 68:54)
thousand times better (68:52 - 68:56)
um (68:54 - 68:58)
yeah the two things that come to mind (68:56 - 68:59)
for me is like (68:58 - 69:01)
everyone just sticks a perfect ditto in (68:59 - 69:02)
there and then never thinks about that (69:01 - 69:04)
ditto again yep (69:02 - 69:09)
and there's like no benefit or no (69:04 - 69:09)
no there's nothing interesting about (69:09 - 69:14)
actually like using the other mechanics (69:12 - 69:16)
that they built of like water egg group (69:14 - 69:19)
dragon egg group uh (69:16 - 69:21)
and morpheus egg group like those those (69:19 - 69:23)
are never even considered or used (69:21 - 69:25)
because it's like just stick a ditto in (69:23 - 69:26)
there (69:25 - 69:27)
let's move on (69:26 - 69:29)
well i mean (69:27 - 69:31)
that was a bigger thing when you (69:29 - 69:34)
couldn't do the egg move thing right (69:31 - 69:35)
like where you could put two in there (69:34 - 69:37)
and it would teach one of the egg moves (69:35 - 69:38)
over (69:37 - 69:40)
so (69:38 - 69:42)
i think the i think (69:40 - 69:45)
for passing down moves (69:42 - 69:47)
the (69:45 - 69:49)
the groups still matter (69:47 - 69:51)
but (69:49 - 69:54)
again we've gotten to a point where (69:51 - 69:56)
even those groups don't matter because (69:54 - 69:57)
it's easier to get an egg move on to (69:56 - 70:00)
something now also you can catch things (69:57 - 70:02)
in the wild that have the egg move now (70:00 - 70:04)
right like they've (70:02 - 70:07)
slowly made the (70:04 - 70:09)
egg groups obsolete because it's way (70:07 - 70:12)
easier to get moves passed down nowadays (70:09 - 70:13)
than (70:12 - 70:17)
deform the chain like you used to (70:13 - 70:17)
the other thing i was gonna say is i i (70:17 - 70:21)
think (70:19 - 70:23)
that with how just games have moved from (70:21 - 70:26)
like even five six seven years ago that (70:23 - 70:32)
most games want you to log in every day (70:26 - 70:34)
and to like grab your attention again (70:32 - 70:37)
and pokemon has enough hooks where you (70:34 - 70:38)
would want to log in every day like (70:37 - 70:41)
things refresh pokemon refresh (70:38 - 70:43)
and (70:41 - 70:43)
i can't think about how much i liked (70:44 - 70:47)
pelego and having to put eggs in pelico (70:45 - 70:49)
and then the next day check it (70:47 - 70:52)
and that should just be like a thing (70:49 - 70:54)
in every pokemon game going forward is (70:52 - 70:57)
there's a spa here next to the (70:54 - 70:57)
um (70:57 - 71:00)
[Music] (70:57 - 71:02)
let me put like 12 eggs in it every (71:00 - 71:04)
night before i go to bed and now i have (71:02 - 71:06)
another reason to come back to your game (71:04 - 71:08)
every day (71:06 - 71:09)
even if i'm not playing (71:08 - 71:13)
or exploring or doing a battle i'm (71:09 - 71:15)
logging into your game i'm checking my (71:13 - 71:16)
eggs (71:15 - 71:18)
it could be exciting if not i'm going to (71:16 - 71:19)
put more eggs in and i'm going to come (71:18 - 71:21)
back every day it would be nice to have (71:19 - 71:23)
the guy who has the egg just say do you (71:21 - 71:25)
want to take it with you or do you want (71:23 - 71:28)
to put it in the incubator (71:25 - 71:28)
i think there could be a lot of (71:33 - 71:36)
like i i feel like the whole egg system (71:34 - 71:37)
could just be stripped out and start (71:36 - 71:39)
fresh (71:37 - 71:43)
man this question has really opened up (71:39 - 71:45)
it's like so innocuous to start i don't (71:43 - 71:46)
know (71:45 - 71:47)
what (71:46 - 71:49)
fresh looks like (71:47 - 71:53)
not sitting in front of a daycare for 20 (71:49 - 71:55)
plus hours a week spinning in circles (71:53 - 71:57)
like it would be nice that it would be (71:55 - 72:00)
nice if i could (71:57 - 72:00)
like like i think about how much time in (72:02 - 72:06)
store and shield i wasted just like okay (72:04 - 72:08)
i'm going to go through all of island of (72:06 - 72:09)
armor i'm gonna pick up all my feathers (72:08 - 72:11)
i'm gonna pick up um all the items on (72:09 - 72:13)
the ground i'm gonna shake all the trees (72:11 - 72:16)
and it's like yeah you could bring eggs (72:13 - 72:18)
with you but you still have to do the (72:16 - 72:20)
work up front to sit in front of the (72:18 - 72:23)
daycare spin in a circle talk to the old (72:20 - 72:24)
person (72:23 - 72:26)
then like the the maintenance of like (72:24 - 72:28)
moving the five into your into your (72:26 - 72:29)
inventory making sure you have flame (72:28 - 72:30)
body okay now i'm going to start (72:29 - 72:32)
exploring now i'm gonna get stopped (72:30 - 72:35)
gotta wait for these animations like (72:32 - 72:37)
there's if the game wants me to do a (72:35 - 72:40)
bunch of repetitive mindless tasks it it (72:37 - 72:42)
sucks that like i have to do so much (72:40 - 72:44)
setup to even (72:42 - 72:47)
do that like can you imagine (72:44 - 72:49)
spinning in front of the daycare (72:47 - 72:52)
for hours to get enough eggs so then you (72:49 - 72:53)
can do your dailies with your eggs so (72:52 - 72:55)
you're like trying to kill two birds (72:53 - 72:57)
with one stone but not really like (72:55 - 73:01)
it's just it's just a little like (72:57 - 73:01)
i wish there was a better system for all (73:01 - 73:08)
of this so what you want is (73:03 - 73:08)
a shorter (73:09 - 73:13)
time for the eggs to get produced (73:10 - 73:15)
i don't i wouldn't even mind if the eggs (73:13 - 73:17)
take longer to hatch (73:15 - 73:19)
no but i mean like (73:17 - 73:21)
for the person to find the egg say hey (73:19 - 73:24)
we found (73:21 - 73:27)
eggs it would almost be like just like (73:24 - 73:29)
put the two pokemon in the daycare (73:27 - 73:31)
have maybe even like a separate bag (73:29 - 73:34)
that's your egg whatever (73:31 - 73:36)
and (73:34 - 73:39)
if that is full (73:36 - 73:39)
the things will hatch when you walk (73:40 - 73:42)
around you don't have to put them in (73:41 - 73:43)
your party (73:42 - 73:46)
but once they hatch (73:43 - 73:48)
new ones fill in so it's almost like (73:46 - 73:49)
you're playing this entire game with (73:48 - 73:52)
like the eggs that you've set up (73:49 - 73:55)
so would you want like you put your two (73:52 - 73:57)
pokemon in (73:55 - 73:59)
the daycare (73:57 - 74:01)
and since we now have cell phones in (73:59 - 74:04)
literally every game including the past (74:01 - 74:07)
the person calls you and says (74:04 - 74:09)
that we found an egg do you want to come (74:07 - 74:11)
back and get it or do you want it to go (74:09 - 74:13)
in the incubator (74:11 - 74:14)
and it doesn't matter where you are in (74:13 - 74:16)
the game you just get the call (74:14 - 74:17)
and then you can say put it in the (74:16 - 74:20)
incubator or i'll come and get it (74:17 - 74:21)
yeah something like that (74:20 - 74:23)
i don't know i just i just feel like (74:21 - 74:24)
there's something better that you can do (74:23 - 74:26)
that's not just like if you wanted to if (74:24 - 74:28)
your if your goal was like i'm just (74:26 - 74:30)
gonna sit out here and grind out (74:28 - 74:32)
perfect ivs or shinies in front of the (74:30 - 74:35)
daycare like yeah go for it but (74:32 - 74:37)
it would still be nice to be like i have (74:35 - 74:38)
all these eggs and i would like to hatch (74:37 - 74:40)
them but i also just want to do other (74:38 - 74:41)
things (74:40 - 74:42)
and i don't want to pick and choose (74:41 - 74:44)
between like (74:42 - 74:46)
farming berries or sitting in front of (74:44 - 74:49)
the daycare spinning a circle i am (74:46 - 74:51)
on a romantic (74:49 - 74:54)
ferris wheel ride with my green haired (74:51 - 74:56)
boyfriend (74:54 - 74:59)
he's about to ask me a very important (74:56 - 75:00)
question (74:59 - 75:02)
ring ring (75:00 - 75:03)
ring hey (75:02 - 75:07)
this is abe from the from the nursery (75:03 - 75:09)
yeah your pokemon just got an egg (75:07 - 75:11)
what you want me to do with it (75:09 - 75:14)
this is real life will and then and it's (75:11 - 75:17)
like it's not real life because (75:14 - 75:19)
at least two out of three of us are on (75:17 - 75:23)
the do not disturb no notification squad (75:19 - 75:25)
possibly three out of three of us i (75:23 - 75:28)
don't know i can't speak for you greg (75:25 - 75:28)
youngster joey's gonna be in charge of (75:32 - 75:37)
the uh oh heck yeah (75:34 - 75:38)
here's the other here's the opposite (75:37 - 75:40)
question (75:38 - 75:43)
if gen 9 comes out do you want another (75:40 - 75:45)
game that is the same (75:43 - 75:47)
ultimately the same system that it was (75:45 - 75:49)
for sword and shield for ultrasound (75:47 - 75:51)
ultramoon for sun and moon for x and y (75:49 - 75:54)
from omega ruby for literally all the (75:51 - 75:56)
way back to original diamond pearl it (75:54 - 75:58)
has been (75:56 - 76:00)
almost exactly identical (75:58 - 76:04)
yeah no i want i want to have a very (76:00 - 76:06)
farm in one place where i can farm all (76:04 - 76:08)
my berries in one place and not have (76:06 - 76:10)
these little plots of between four and (76:08 - 76:13)
two potential berries that are ugh (76:10 - 76:17)
that you can't even fly to them (76:13 - 76:17)
berries finally it's taken two months (76:18 - 76:25)
will is on the hating brilliant (76:21 - 76:27)
i don't hate it it does i'm just very (76:25 - 76:29)
upset that i couldn't get a berry farm (76:27 - 76:31)
oros had the same problem except that (76:29 - 76:35)
you could fly to the barracks (76:31 - 76:38)
yeah i mean (76:35 - 76:38)
every game brings slight changes to (76:41 - 76:46)
breeding and i (76:43 - 76:49)
apart from the time it takes i don't (76:46 - 76:51)
have a problem with breeding (76:49 - 76:53)
again i (76:51 - 76:54)
having (76:53 - 76:58)
my biggest complaint about breeding in (76:54 - 77:02)
brilliant diamond was it took (76:58 - 77:05)
so long (77:02 - 77:06)
and (77:05 - 77:09)
it would be better if (77:06 - 77:13)
it took less time on all of the steps (77:09 - 77:16)
but i don't i still don't have a good (77:13 - 77:18)
like when we say do you want something (77:16 - 77:21)
new i don't know what something (77:18 - 77:22)
new (77:21 - 77:24)
looks like to say (77:22 - 77:25)
yeah i want that (77:24 - 77:28)
because that something new is so (77:25 - 77:29)
amorphous (77:28 - 77:32)
that i can't say like throw out all the (77:29 - 77:34)
improvements that you've made so far (77:32 - 77:36)
don't improve on things (77:34 - 77:37)
check it out and give me something (77:36 - 77:38)
completely different because i have no (77:37 - 77:40)
idea what something completely different (77:38 - 77:40)
is (77:40 - 77:43)
so my inclination isn't (77:40 - 77:45)
yeah i want something absolutely (77:43 - 77:46)
something something new and something (77:45 - 77:48)
completely different because they have (77:46 - 77:50)
done things like that and they have been (77:48 - 77:53)
awful (77:50 - 77:53)
also (77:53 - 77:56)
the one the the big trap that i think a (77:54 - 78:00)
lot of pokemon fans frequently fall into (77:56 - 78:01)
is (78:00 - 78:04)
if you make something too easy (78:01 - 78:06)
at certain points if you make something (78:04 - 78:07)
too easy (78:06 - 78:09)
people lose interest it's not worth (78:07 - 78:11)
doing anymore it's not (78:09 - 78:13)
there's just like some (78:11 - 78:16)
like level that you pass where it's like (78:13 - 78:17)
it doesn't take any effort to do this (78:16 - 78:19)
well i don't even want to bother to do (78:17 - 78:20)
this because it's not an achievement (78:19 - 78:21)
anymore (78:20 - 78:24)
and i think that's the drawback (78:21 - 78:26)
but you could look at brilliant diamond (78:24 - 78:28)
shining pearl as a good example of this (78:26 - 78:30)
why would you ever breed in those games (78:28 - 78:32)
it's awful (78:30 - 78:34)
like like the bike is awful the movement (78:32 - 78:36)
is awful the like where you can actually (78:34 - 78:38)
breed is not (78:36 - 78:41)
particularly engaging or interesting (78:38 - 78:44)
um having to start everything over again (78:41 - 78:47)
from two plus years of sword and shield (78:44 - 78:49)
where (78:47 - 78:52)
you it was way easier to get an actually (78:49 - 78:55)
like legit for iv ditto and like to (78:52 - 78:58)
trade with other people like (78:55 - 79:00)
the only (78:58 - 79:01)
way (79:00 - 79:06)
to get a 5 iv ditto (79:01 - 79:07)
is either be the luckiest person in the (79:06 - 79:11)
world and 32 times 32 times 32 times 32 (79:07 - 79:16)
or to get a radar chain of a hundred (79:11 - 79:16)
which (79:17 - 79:19)
good (79:20 - 79:24)
luck yeah (79:21 - 79:24)
so so even if (79:25 - 79:30)
even if if you were one of those lucky (79:28 - 79:32)
people and you got a five iv ditto and (79:30 - 79:34)
you found a japanese player they got a (79:32 - 79:36)
five iv ditto you decided to trade so (79:34 - 79:38)
you both come a sudo method (79:36 - 79:40)
there is still (79:38 - 79:43)
not a lot of this incentive (79:40 - 79:45)
to masuda (79:43 - 79:47)
in (79:45 - 79:47)
also like yes you can masuda but like (79:47 - 79:54)
who's gotten the shiny charm yet in in (79:51 - 79:56)
brilliant diamond shining pearl because (79:54 - 79:59)
how that has been a complete nightmare (79:56 - 80:00)
to (79:59 - 80:03)
just try to get all 400 pokemon that the (80:00 - 80:05)
493 (80:03 - 80:08)
493 (80:05 - 80:08)
i i i i don't even have a nidoqueen yet (80:10 - 80:16)
because i i i spent (80:13 - 80:19)
three hours thiefing moonstones off of (80:16 - 80:22)
clefairy and i was able to get like five (80:19 - 80:23)
of them (80:22 - 80:26)
and i'm i still need like three more (80:23 - 80:27)
i don't want to go back there (80:26 - 80:30)
i that's the the best way to get moon (80:27 - 80:32)
stones is like to find the like 10 (80:30 - 80:34)
clefairy and the thief it and hope that (80:32 - 80:35)
it has 20 (80:34 - 80:38)
moons like (80:35 - 80:38)
it has been a nightmare (80:38 - 80:42)
to complete (80:40 - 80:46)
your pokedex in this game (80:42 - 80:50)
the movement and the the bike is awful (80:46 - 80:51)
the (80:50 - 80:55)
difficulty to get a 5 i 4 3 2 (80:51 - 80:57)
difficulty of getting a decent iv ditto (80:55 - 81:01)
is awful why like there is no reason (80:57 - 81:02)
anyone should be (81:01 - 81:06)
masuda methoding anything in this game (81:02 - 81:08)
unless you care about competitive but (81:06 - 81:10)
that's already died all the competitive (81:08 - 81:11)
people that were so hot on their high (81:10 - 81:12)
horse for brilliant diamond shining (81:11 - 81:14)
pearl as soon as seafood 12 was (81:12 - 81:15)
announced for sword and shield they all (81:14 - 81:17)
just dumped diamond and pearl and moved (81:15 - 81:20)
back to sword and shield (81:17 - 81:20)
like if anything diamond and pearl has (81:22 - 81:26)
shown like (81:23 - 81:26)
even if it's the same thing the things (81:27 - 81:30)
around your game (81:28 - 81:34)
influence that same thing (81:30 - 81:34)
anyways (81:38 - 81:42)
will pokemon of the week (81:39 - 81:43)
well (81:42 - 81:45)
unfortunately (81:43 - 81:47)
i didn't save the document from last (81:45 - 81:49)
week so i don't 100 remember what the (81:47 - 81:52)
clues were but i know it's a pokemon (81:49 - 81:54)
that started with c (81:52 - 81:57)
it weighs one hectogram which for those (81:54 - 82:00)
of you who are not familiar with the (81:57 - 82:03)
metric system that's that's uh (82:00 - 82:04)
that's (82:03 - 82:06)
a hundred grams it's not even a full (82:04 - 82:08)
kilogram (82:06 - 82:08)
so (82:08 - 82:10)
keep that in mind when you're performing (82:08 - 82:13)
your considerations and also (82:10 - 82:15)
uh it is a legendary that evolves that (82:13 - 82:17)
doesn't know (82:15 - 82:20)
any moves that can attack (82:17 - 82:22)
i mean that's pretty much all you need (82:20 - 82:23)
to know (82:22 - 82:26)
oh i think oh also it's evolution i hate (82:23 - 82:29)
this it's evolution is based on the game (82:26 - 82:31)
that evolves in (82:29 - 82:33)
not like any criteria about the (82:31 - 82:35)
environment that it lives in but it's (82:33 - 82:40)
just the game that it evolves in (82:35 - 82:41)
i got it (82:40 - 82:44)
it's (82:41 - 82:44)
ducklit (82:44 - 82:48)
yeah let's start with c chat (82:45 - 82:50)
with that (82:48 - 82:50)
it's cosmog (82:51 - 82:55)
cosmog (82:53 - 82:59)
not cosmoem cosmoam is the heavy one (82:55 - 83:01)
did you not say it was heavy i said it's (82:59 - 83:04)
100 grams do you know 100 grams is like (83:01 - 83:05)
nothing (83:04 - 83:07)
oh one kilogram (83:05 - 83:10)
one kilogram is (83:07 - 83:12)
2.2 pounds about (83:10 - 83:16)
so 100 grams is a tenth of that so it's (83:12 - 83:19)
like four ounces (83:16 - 83:20)
[Music] (83:19 - 83:22)
cosmog has the lowest base stats of all (83:20 - 83:24)
engineering pokemon (83:22 - 83:25)
has the smallest move pool of all (83:24 - 83:28)
legendary pokemon (83:25 - 83:30)
uh cosmog and its evolutions are (83:28 - 83:32)
evolution are the only pokemon unable to (83:30 - 83:36)
damage an opponent outside of struggle (83:32 - 83:37)
since it cannot learn any attacking (83:36 - 83:39)
moves (83:37 - 83:41)
uh (83:39 - 83:43)
cosmog's attack animation is only seen (83:41 - 83:45)
in battle in the pokemon with illusion (83:43 - 83:49)
as a disguise as if cosmo sorry (83:45 - 83:51)
cosmog's attack animation is only seen (83:49 - 83:54)
in battle if a pokemon with illusion is (83:51 - 83:57)
disguised as cosmog and used an (83:54 - 84:00)
attacking move so basically if you have (83:57 - 84:02)
a zoroark come in as cosmog and then (84:00 - 84:04)
attack (84:02 - 84:05)
however this animation can be used (84:04 - 84:07)
viewed in the pokedex the alola photo (84:05 - 84:12)
club pokemon camp and pokemon home oh (84:07 - 84:12)
cosmog's evolution into cosmoem has the (84:12 - 84:17)
greatest standard deviation of all (84:15 - 84:18)
pokemon with (84:17 - 84:22)
47.14 meaning that it changes (84:18 - 84:25)
to its base stats on evolving are the (84:22 - 84:29)
most uneven of all pokemon (84:25 - 84:31)
i don't know what that means but sure (84:29 - 84:34)
i don't know what that means either (84:31 - 84:37)
i think the jump between (84:34 - 84:39)
oh it's stats it stats is very is the (84:37 - 84:41)
most drastic (84:39 - 84:44)
got it (84:41 - 84:44)
uh so (84:46 - 84:50)
have we never seen the shiny form for (84:47 - 84:51)
cosmog (84:50 - 84:52)
i (84:51 - 84:54)
don't think so (84:52 - 84:56)
because it's not on this page (84:54 - 85:00)
just can't be shiny (84:56 - 85:00)
because usually somebody like hacks the (85:01 - 85:06)
data and finds out that what the shiny (85:04 - 85:10)
looks like shuffle icon solid fyi (85:06 - 85:12)
uh cosmo has a shiny form yeah but are (85:10 - 85:15)
you are you seeing one for cosmog (85:12 - 85:17)
no well i mean it would be in the same (85:15 - 85:19)
place so it looks like they're identical (85:17 - 85:20)
there's probably something different (85:19 - 85:23)
about it like how marshado it looks (85:20 - 85:27)
exactly the same except um (85:23 - 85:27)
uh when it's like hood comes up that's (85:27 - 85:31)
when you can see it's shiny oh i see it (85:29 - 85:33)
i see it i see it i see it i think the (85:31 - 85:35)
purple is lighter (85:33 - 85:36)
oh (85:35 - 85:38)
if you look at look at it from behind (85:36 - 85:40)
the (85:38 - 85:43)
the it's in normal it's blue from behind (85:40 - 85:46)

miss for people (86:12 - 86:15)
here we go (86:14 - 86:19)
this pokemon beloved by a dear friend of (86:15 - 86:21)
unova's pokemon professor (86:19 - 86:23)
can be directly linked to the (86:21 - 86:26)
introduction of hidden abilities (86:23 - 86:28)
it could learn the move dream eater at (86:26 - 86:31)
level 41 when originally introduced but (86:28 - 86:34)
now has to wait until level 44 (86:31 - 86:36)
because of the introduction of fairy (86:34 - 86:39)
type moves (86:36 - 86:39)
that's all i'm giving you oh (86:40 - 86:45)
there's gonna be another sentence nope (86:42 - 86:46)

before legends comes out (86:50 - 86:55)
and then (86:52 - 86:56)
i believe greg and i will be doing some (86:55 - 86:58)
sort of mini series for legends why (86:56 - 87:02)
can't i do one you play too slow maybe (86:58 - 87:03)
i'll play (87:02 - 87:06)
fast i mean i doubt it but (87:03 - 87:07)
it's going to be a while because we need (87:06 - 87:08)
to figure out when we're recording (87:07 - 87:09)
because (87:08 - 87:12)
i'm not on vacation (87:09 - 87:14)
we'll figure it out (87:12 - 87:15)
granted (87:14 - 87:17)

out (87:47 - 87:50)
so (87:48 - 87:51)

guess the reason i start at noon on (87:51 - 87:54)
friday (87:53 - 87:56)
is so when people get it on midnight (87:54 - 87:57)
they can play and they can be a little (87:56 - 87:59)
bit ahead and then i don't have to worry (87:57 - 88:01)
about spoilers because i play (87:59 - 88:03)
a little slower (88:01 - 88:07)
some people just zoom through the game (88:03 - 88:07)
uh so that'll be exciting (88:08 - 88:11)
