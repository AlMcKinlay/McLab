dog barking at said Thunder (0:38 - 0:43)

of in line with that I just recently uh (1:15 - 1:21)
unfollowed and blocked Steve on Twitter (1:19 - 1:23)
because he broke the one rule and not (1:21 - 1:25)
Twitter Tick Tock the one rule that I (1:23 - 1:28)
set down for you guys on tick tock (1:25 - 1:31)
no (1:28 - 1:31)
I said the next time you have some (1:32 - 1:39)
random Pokemon generator thing scroll (1:35 - 1:43)
across the top of your head and it ends (1:39 - 1:44)
up with the Pokemon you don't like and (1:43 - 1:47)
you get upset about it you're done (1:44 - 1:50)
and you're like please be girachi please (1:47 - 1:54)
be like ah this is terrible dude it's a (1:50 - 1:56)
random number (1:54 - 1:56)
but what if it was Jirachi still (1:56 - 2:03)
wouldn't have cared but you're done you (2:00 - 2:04)
know I do as many more of those as you (2:03 - 2:08)
wish because I will never see them (2:04 - 2:08)
like a cutie (2:15 - 2:22)
uh not a lot of exciting news this week (2:18 - 2:28)
let's talk about bees okay all right (2:22 - 2:28)
there's one take away from that episode (2:30 - 2:35)
These are fish now (2:32 - 2:37)
uh we do it we do have some some news (2:35 - 2:39)
and uh we are getting closer and closer (2:37 - 2:42)
to the Seattle go Fest so that's uh (2:39 - 2:44)
that's a thing coming up (2:42 - 2:46)
um well speaking of Pokemon go let's (2:44 - 2:48)
start with the Pokemon TCG that's a (2:46 - 2:50)
twist (2:48 - 2:52)
really (2:50 - 2:57)
uh Pokemon TCG Pokemon go expansion it (2:52 - 2:59)
is here (2:57 - 3:02)
uh and it features radiant Pokemon (2:59 - 3:05)
which uh is radiant Venusaur radiant (3:02 - 3:08)
Charizard radiant Blastoise they have (3:05 - 3:11)
the ditto card which is like a sticker (3:08 - 3:12)
of a different Pokemon and you can peel (3:11 - 3:15)
it off and then there's ditto (3:12 - 3:16)
um there's a bunch of new item cards if (3:15 - 3:20)
you actually care about playing the TCG (3:16 - 3:20)
um and then they like feature (3:20 - 3:25)
uh Candela Blanche spark Professor (3:22 - 3:29)
Willow who is still dead in the game yo (3:25 - 3:32)
um true don't believe Greg (3:29 - 3:36)
he died he did not die he's gone by (3:32 - 3:38)
guzzlord (3:36 - 3:40)
each thing said they don't come back he (3:38 - 3:43)
is on vacation I I do think it's funny (3:40 - 3:45)
because I have seen a couple people who (3:43 - 3:48)
have zero interest in the TCG want to (3:45 - 3:49)
get these cards because they're big (3:48 - 3:52)
Pokemon go fans so marketing wise I (3:49 - 3:55)
guess that's working but they one of the (3:52 - 3:58)
questions I was asked was why are they (3:55 - 4:00)
called radiant Pokemon and just not (3:58 - 4:03)
shiny Pokemon (4:00 - 4:03)
and anytime there's like a weird naming (4:03 - 4:08)
scheme and the TCG is is is really just (4:05 - 4:10)
rules yeah (4:08 - 4:13)
like a like a radiant Pokemon there can (4:10 - 4:17)
only be one in your deck so by just (4:13 - 4:19)
saying oh this is a radiant Charizard (4:17 - 4:21)
you can only have one you can't have a (4:19 - 4:23)
radiant Charizard and a radiant Greninja (4:21 - 4:25)
and then it's like well why don't they (4:23 - 4:26)
say (4:25 - 4:28)
you can only have one Shiny Pokemon it's (4:26 - 4:31)
like well because there are other shiny (4:28 - 4:33)
Pokemon cards and it goes back like (4:31 - 4:35)
several years and what if you're playing (4:33 - 4:37)
expanded because expanded would still (4:35 - 4:39)
need those rules and their shining (4:37 - 4:42)
Pokemon which is not limited (4:39 - 4:46)
um and there are just shiny yeah it's (4:42 - 4:49)
it's a real thing why are they limited (4:46 - 4:52)
to one because they're really powerful (4:49 - 4:54)
so the Charizard this is actually maybe (4:52 - 4:57)
one of the most Charizard cards are bad (4:54 - 5:01)
this is a a long staple of the TCG but (4:57 - 5:03)
Charizard is the best Charizard cards (5:01 - 5:06)
are bad the radiant Charizard is (5:03 - 5:07)
actually really good (5:06 - 5:11)
um so it has it has an ability (5:07 - 5:12)
um sometimes they also change abilities (5:11 - 5:14)
to Pokey powers and then Pokey powers (5:12 - 5:15)
back to abilities that's just like a way (5:14 - 5:17)
they're the literally the same thing but (5:15 - 5:19)
it's a way for certain cards to say like (5:17 - 5:21)
if this Pokemon has an ability or if (5:19 - 5:23)
this Pokemon has a poke power yep (5:21 - 5:26)
there's a it's just rule changes anyways (5:23 - 5:29)
its ability is called excited heart this (5:26 - 5:32)
Pokemon's attack cost is one colorless (5:29 - 5:34)
less for each prize card your opponent (5:32 - 5:37)
has taken if you look at its move which (5:34 - 5:39)
is combustion blast which does 250 (5:37 - 5:41)
damage for five energy one of those (5:39 - 5:43)
being (5:41 - 5:45)
um fire the other four can be any energy (5:43 - 5:47)
you want during your next turn this (5:45 - 5:50)
Pokemon cannot use combustion blast so (5:47 - 5:52)
ultimately what it's saying is is (5:50 - 5:55)
because of its ability if your opponent (5:52 - 5:57)
has taken four prize cards and they need (5:55 - 6:00)
to take six prize cards to win you can (5:57 - 6:05)
do 250 damage for one energy card (6:00 - 6:08)
which is insane yeah (6:05 - 6:11)
according to the quadrant theory of tcgs (6:08 - 6:13)
though that's not a good card any card (6:11 - 6:15)
that falls into the quadrant of it's (6:13 - 6:17)
only good if you're losing is not a good (6:15 - 6:19)
card uh (6:17 - 6:21)
it is a comeback card though right like (6:19 - 6:24)
in a if you you like you don't want to (6:21 - 6:26)
start with this card ever and there's (6:24 - 6:28)
only one but (6:26 - 6:31)
if you're in a situation where it would (6:28 - 6:32)
work in a situation where you both have (6:31 - 6:36)
two prizes left right and you lie sander (6:32 - 6:37)
up a (6:36 - 6:40)
V-Star which is two prizes and then you (6:37 - 6:42)
attach your one energy and then you do (6:40 - 6:45)
your combustion blast and you win (6:42 - 6:46)
because a lot of V-Star Pokemon come in (6:45 - 6:48)
under 250. (6:46 - 6:50)
is (6:48 - 6:52)
Ultra Ball (6:50 - 6:55)
available (6:52 - 6:57)
yes (6:55 - 7:00)
well I mean it was taken out for for a (6:57 - 7:01)
while because (7:00 - 7:05)
that lets you search out any Pokemon (7:01 - 7:07)
which makes ah I don't know if Ultra (7:05 - 7:09)
Ball is back I think Ultra Ball is back (7:07 - 7:11)
there there are other pokeballs to get (7:09 - 7:12)
stuff (7:11 - 7:15)
no worries there they got okay (7:12 - 7:17)
they got cards to find cards there's a (7:15 - 7:20)
lot of there's a lot (7:17 - 7:20)
um but this this Charizard's okay I (7:21 - 7:25)
think it's like a 35 card it's not like (7:23 - 7:27)
the most expensive Charizard in the (7:25 - 7:29)
entire world (7:27 - 7:31)
I was a question yeah you did a big (7:29 - 7:32)
package (7:31 - 7:38)
recently I did get all of The Shining (7:32 - 7:40)
radiant Pokemon (7:38 - 7:43)
um yeah the Pokemon company did send me (7:40 - 7:44)
a big (7:43 - 7:48)
Pokemon go TCG package (7:44 - 7:50)
um I didn't open all the packs I did (7:48 - 7:52)
find two radiant Charizards and three (7:50 - 7:56)
radiant venusaurs no radiant Blastoise (7:52 - 7:58)
so with that logic Brady and Blastoise (7:56 - 8:00)
has to be the most rare (7:58 - 8:02)
uh expensive card with that yeah (8:00 - 8:06)
absolutely that one case study uh (8:02 - 8:08)
I'm looking on cool stuff Inc and there (8:06 - 8:10)
is an Ultra Ball from the most recent (8:08 - 8:12)
set because it's got a little F at the (8:10 - 8:15)
bottom so I'm imagining it's back okay (8:12 - 8:17)
yeah I think Ultra Ball is missing just (8:15 - 8:18)
for a little bit and then they brought (8:17 - 8:19)
it back (8:18 - 8:23)
uh I found the ditto I peeled the ditto (8:19 - 8:25)
I watched it though (8:23 - 8:28)
uh it was it was a good peel (8:25 - 8:30)
people were upset that I compared (8:28 - 8:32)
peeling the ditto to peeling a good (8:30 - 8:33)
sunburn (8:32 - 8:37)
and I I stand by that statement (8:33 - 8:40)
I think it's better (8:37 - 8:40)
sunburn's hard to peel nah I don't know (8:41 - 8:44)
if you get real burned (8:43 - 8:47)
I I saw a tick tock that said if you've (8:44 - 8:49)
gotten sunburned like four times in your (8:47 - 8:51)
life you're like twice the risk of skin (8:49 - 8:54)
cancer that's like literally every kid (8:51 - 8:56)
in the 90s yeah no one of those words no (8:54 - 8:57)
one wants to win sunscreen in the 90s (8:56 - 9:00)
that's not true yes (8:57 - 9:03)
um but any skin discoloration will lead (9:00 - 9:06)
to skin cancer as a family of five my (9:03 - 9:08)
parents were not buying sunscreen they (9:06 - 9:10)
were go outside and play you'll be fine (9:08 - 9:12)
I will one-up you (9:10 - 9:15)
in the late 70s early 80s we were (9:12 - 9:19)
actively putting oil on our skin to burn (9:15 - 9:22)
in the Sun so we could get a good tan (9:19 - 9:24)
after (9:22 - 9:24)
was that a I remember that being a thing (9:24 - 9:29)
of like you want to burn first and then (9:26 - 9:30)
afterwards and then afterwards you'll (9:29 - 9:32)
get a good tan but that's not true is (9:30 - 9:33)
that true no (9:32 - 9:35)
no it's not true (9:33 - 9:37)
and we thought we ever thought it was (9:35 - 9:42)
burning both are bad for your skin (9:37 - 9:42)
but my brother would sit out in the sun (9:42 - 9:47)
slathered in oil (9:44 - 9:49)
constantly in the summer (9:47 - 9:51)
how he's still alive is beyond me (9:49 - 9:52)
terrible (9:51 - 9:55)
uh peeling the ditto is is it's it's (9:52 - 9:57)
great (9:55 - 9:57)
it's rare (9:58 - 10:02)
good euphemism for something (9:59 - 10:06)
[Laughter] (10:02 - 10:06)
uh uh million dollar question right (10:09 - 10:15)
remember when we all got ancient mute (10:12 - 10:17)
okay I know we make the interview joke a (10:15 - 10:19)
lot but uh yeah I still have my ancient (10:17 - 10:21)
Mew yes I understand the comparison here (10:19 - 10:23)
so when we when we all went to the movie (10:21 - 10:26)
theater we all got our ancient Mew it (10:23 - 10:28)
came in like a rapper yeah (10:26 - 10:32)
and the the the not the debate but the (10:28 - 10:35)
question was do you unwrap the agent mu (10:32 - 10:38)
so you can actually see if it's centered (10:35 - 10:42)
and like printed properly or do you keep (10:38 - 10:46)
the ancient mu in the wrapper but then (10:42 - 10:47)
you don't actually know what it looks (10:46 - 10:50)
like because there's that that like info (10:47 - 10:52)
card that covers the the front so you (10:50 - 10:54)
can't actually see the ancient Mew (10:52 - 10:57)
you always see the back of it (10:54 - 11:01)
um so Flash Forward to now when you find (10:57 - 11:03)
a ditto I have a ditto right here sorry (11:01 - 11:06)
audio listeners um this is just a (11:03 - 11:08)
spinner rack but it's a ditto (11:06 - 11:12)
so I I peeled the ditto oh I have a (11:08 - 11:13)
peeled ditto right here again sorry (11:12 - 11:15)
podcast listeners here's the ditto the (11:13 - 11:17)
the card that was above this was a (11:15 - 11:20)
numble so I peeled the number by the way (11:17 - 11:22)
the number is like a sticker you can (11:20 - 11:23)
stick it on whatever you want it's like (11:22 - 11:25)
not a very strong sticker because (11:23 - 11:28)
adhesive isn't like super strong so now (11:25 - 11:30)
I have two Dittos I have a ditto ditto (11:28 - 11:33)
and I have a spinner act ditto so in (11:30 - 11:36)
like 50 years when these cards are worth (11:33 - 11:38)
like five dollars instead of like 10 (11:36 - 11:40)
cents (11:38 - 11:44)
is the Pokemon that is on top of the (11:40 - 11:48)
ditto going to determine whether it's (11:44 - 11:49)
worth more or not like people are like (11:48 - 11:52)
oh you have a spinner acted up no no no (11:49 - 11:55)
no I want the B doof ditto yeah that's (11:52 - 11:57)
one of them was printed less than the (11:55 - 11:59)
others and that will be the one that (11:57 - 12:00)
people will be seeking out the number (11:59 - 12:02)
there was actually only three numble (12:00 - 12:06)
Dittos ever oh true I've already peeled (12:02 - 12:09)
one of them the record have peeled one (12:06 - 12:11)
so there's only two left look you have (12:09 - 12:14)
to peel it so the few people who don't (12:11 - 12:17)
peel it actually see value if everybody (12:14 - 12:19)
doesn't peel it if everybody doesn't (12:17 - 12:21)
open their ancient Mew (12:19 - 12:24)
it's worthless because everybody has the (12:21 - 12:26)
same that's that's a rhetorical question (12:24 - 12:27)
because (12:26 - 12:30)
this is the very logical steps here (12:27 - 12:34)
parents buy Pokemon cards for children (12:30 - 12:37)
under 10 to keep those children quiet (12:34 - 12:40)
I pause it I think that's a valid (12:37 - 12:42)
argument (12:40 - 12:45)
second argument children under 10 cannot (12:42 - 12:47)
resist peeling the ditto (12:45 - 12:50)
they see that's peelable they will peel (12:47 - 12:53)
it I resisted (12:50 - 12:56)
not opening many ancient Muse because I (12:53 - 13:00)
did open one and that was like enough (12:56 - 13:00)
how many ancient Muse did you get (13:01 - 13:07)
oh I saw that movie like four or five (13:05 - 13:09)
times (13:07 - 13:09)
we'll be on like Tuesday where it was (13:14 - 13:18)
like two dollars or whatever right a (13:16 - 13:19)
bottle of sunscreen is two dollars it (13:18 - 13:22)
will last our entire sunscreen is a (13:19 - 13:25)
ridiculously expensive 90s no it was (13:22 - 13:27)
it's not that it was not expensive in (13:25 - 13:28)
the 90s if I want to go get banana boat (13:27 - 13:31)
it's like nine dollars (13:28 - 13:31)
right right here I'm sorry audio is n't (13:31 - 13:36)
it (13:34 - 13:36)
this brand yeah this is clinically (13:37 - 13:41)
proven it says the word clinically (13:39 - 13:44)
proven on the bottle bring me to the (13:41 - 13:45)
clinic bring me to the banana boat (13:44 - 13:47)
Clinic please I would like to see their (13:45 - 13:49)
bananas and I feel like this is our (13:47 - 13:51)
special FDA things that you should know (13:49 - 13:54)
about the FDA clinically proven means (13:51 - 13:55)
nothing (13:54 - 13:58)
there is no legal requirement for what (13:55 - 14:01)
clinically proven means (13:58 - 14:03)
foreign (14:01 - 14:03)
though Banana Boat was like nine bucks (14:04 - 14:10)
so get CVS brand what do you do you (14:07 - 14:11)
you're never have you ever even been on (14:10 - 14:16)
a boat yes let alone a banana boat (14:11 - 14:16)
I'm resaying Banana Boat is not the (14:19 - 14:25)
optimal sunscreen it is not oh no we've (14:21 - 14:26)
got much better sunscreens than I mean (14:25 - 14:28)
back in the 90s they didn't do a lot (14:26 - 14:31)
either sunscreen was real weak back then (14:28 - 14:33)
you also shouldn't get the sunscreen (14:31 - 14:35)
that has the stuff that kills the coral (14:33 - 14:38)
reefs correct is that Beach Bum or (14:35 - 14:40)
whatever no it's like 90 of all (14:38 - 14:42)
sunscreens oh (14:40 - 14:45)
uh the other thing (14:42 - 14:49)
about the Pokemon TCG Pokemon go (14:45 - 14:53)
expansion is they come with game codes (14:49 - 14:53)
for Pokemon go (14:55 - 15:01)
oh oh okay not for Pokemon live so yeah (14:57 - 15:03)
yeah yeah okay so when you when you open (15:01 - 15:05)
up when you open pack again sorry sorry (15:03 - 15:07)
audio listeners you get a game code (15:05 - 15:09)
everyone look imagine what it is it's (15:07 - 15:11)
it's the code that has the code on the (15:09 - 15:12)
back right (15:11 - 15:14)
you get you get it comes in every (15:12 - 15:17)
booster pack American booster packs but (15:14 - 15:19)
the Pokemon go comes with uh like it's (15:17 - 15:23)
like an info sheet here I'll show you (15:19 - 15:23)
it looks like this again sorry audio (15:23 - 15:28)
listeners and then on the back is a (15:26 - 15:30)
bunch of codes (15:28 - 15:32)
so it's different than the card (15:30 - 15:34)
and (15:32 - 15:37)
you have to go to either (15:34 - 15:39)
the if you have Android you can go to (15:37 - 15:41)
the bottom of the store where it says (15:39 - 15:42)
redeem code (15:41 - 15:46)
if you have IOS you have to go to the (15:42 - 15:49)
rewards.nianticlabs.com and redeem it (15:46 - 15:50)
there you could also do that on Android (15:49 - 15:51)
I guess it doesn't have to be (15:50 - 15:53)
specifically iOS it might be easier just (15:51 - 15:56)
to use a website who knows uh but you (15:53 - 15:58)
have to redeem the codes before July 1st (15:56 - 16:00)

seven which is the t-shirt and the cap (17:48 - 17:52)
for your character (17:50 - 17:54)
the t-shirt is it looks like it's a blue (17:52 - 17:55)
T-shirt with the two cards like the (17:54 - 17:57)
peaked you had (17:55 - 18:00)
so you can have a hat like Pikachu and (17:57 - 18:03)
you can have a shirt like that (18:00 - 18:06)
yeah how do you get set seven it's just (18:03 - 18:09)
random so so somebody already (18:06 - 18:12)
calculated the odds of all of this stuff (18:09 - 18:14)
and the chance of getting set seven (18:12 - 18:16)
which is the Pokemon TCG shirt and the (18:14 - 18:19)
cap is two percent (18:16 - 18:21)
it's like shiny so it's like a 150 (18:19 - 18:24)
chance to get the shirt what how are (18:21 - 18:26)
these odds calculated (18:24 - 18:29)
somebody redeemed like a thousand of (18:26 - 18:31)
them and then wrote down which which set (18:29 - 18:35)
they got and then that's us that's us a (18:31 - 18:38)
thousand is pretty good (18:35 - 18:40)
somebody out there did the work (18:38 - 18:42)
I mean it could just be one in eight and (18:40 - 18:44)
they just didn't get very much (18:42 - 18:47)
they're really automatically over odds (18:44 - 18:49)
yeah (18:47 - 18:52)
so that's how ads work if you if you (18:49 - 18:55)
like Pokemon go or you like the TCG or (18:52 - 18:57)
you like both (18:55 - 18:57)
um (18:57 - 19:00)
to me they printed this set to the moon (18:57 - 19:04)
I I I've been to targets they're they're (19:00 - 19:06)
there on the shelves they're still (19:04 - 19:08)
available on Pokemon Center they're (19:06 - 19:09)
still available on GameStop cool stuff (19:08 - 19:12)
Inc it does not look like these are sold (19:09 - 19:14)
out anywhere (19:12 - 19:17)
um it came out on July (19:14 - 19:19)

four years ago why wouldn't it still be (19:19 - 19:25)
in stores it's only four days old (19:22 - 19:29)
did do we not remember the like (19:25 - 19:32)
people can go outside again those days (19:29 - 19:36)
are over yes yes when everyone was stuck (19:32 - 19:37)
inside and the only thing keeping us (19:36 - 19:39)
sane was Pokemon cards they were very (19:37 - 19:42)
hard to find but not now we can venture (19:39 - 19:44)
outside (19:42 - 19:46)
uh you guys talked about this last week (19:44 - 19:48)
uh but Ash and Pikachu have arrived in (19:46 - 19:51)
Pokemon Masters ex and they're not a (19:48 - 19:54)

his big battle team is with him (20:28 - 20:35)

you battle him his model and thing is (22:00 - 22:06)
built there's no way he is not a single (22:04 - 22:08)
pair in the future there is one (22:06 - 22:11)
thing I have a beef with (22:08 - 22:15)
in this story (22:11 - 22:18)
they introduce a character Tina (22:15 - 22:20)
who literally comes out of nowhere and (22:18 - 22:24)
they had to look up who Tina was (22:20 - 22:27)
like who is Tina why am I here Tina no (22:24 - 22:30)
it's this it's this new traitor with the (22:27 - 22:32)
Flareon and I'm like who is Tina where (22:30 - 22:35)
did Tina come from who is she she was (22:32 - 22:38)
literally created as a new rival and (22:35 - 22:41)
introduced here with no Fanfare you just (22:38 - 22:43)
walk in with her I'm like I (22:41 - 22:45)
I don't know who where where did Tina (22:43 - 22:50)
come from and I'm hoping they do more (22:45 - 22:52)
with Tina like but they had no backstory (22:50 - 22:55)
it's not like suddenly Tina appeared on (22:52 - 22:57)
pazzio or anything it's just like your (22:55 - 22:59)
main character walking in with your pal (22:57 - 23:01)
rival Tina and I'm like who is Tina (22:59 - 23:03)
get out of here I like the idea of Tina (23:01 - 23:06)
just randomly get out of here Tina get (23:03 - 23:08)
up you're not my friend (23:06 - 23:10)
um I will also say it's a little uncanny (23:08 - 23:13)
valley to fight Ash with red because (23:10 - 23:16)
it's like looking in the mirror universe (23:13 - 23:18)
I was like this is what you could be Ash (23:16 - 23:22)
who voices Ash in Masters (23:18 - 23:25)
it's the same as the anime I mean the (23:22 - 23:26)
voice sounds exactly the same so I I (23:25 - 23:28)
don't think it's different I think Sarah (23:26 - 23:32)
tweeted something about it yeah (23:28 - 23:34)
this story is cute it's exactly what you (23:32 - 23:36)
expect from Ash (23:34 - 23:38)
it was interesting that they used the (23:36 - 23:40)
alola ash (23:38 - 23:40)
isn't that the standard now (23:42 - 23:45)
no (23:44 - 23:47)
they changed them again they switched (23:45 - 23:50)
him back yeah is it not the little Ash (23:47 - 23:51)
I'm pretty sure this is a little little (23:50 - 23:54)
Ash I thought I don't think it's the (23:51 - 23:56)
yellow lash maybe hold on I feel like (23:54 - 23:59)
his cheeks are really soft (23:56 - 23:59)
have you pinched them recently no like (23:59 - 24:06)
like the line work I (24:02 - 24:07)
um (24:06 - 24:09)
I think alola Ash's face is rounder than (24:07 - 24:12)
the one in Masters yeah I guess you're (24:09 - 24:13)
right I mean he's wearing the outfit (24:12 - 24:15)
that he's wearing in Journeys it just (24:13 - 24:18)
looks like his face is softer (24:15 - 24:18)
nah I know looking at pictures from (24:20 - 24:26)
alola his face is much (24:23 - 24:28)
rounder (24:26 - 24:31)
and that he I think they made him look (24:28 - 24:34)
younger in Masters than he does in (24:31 - 24:37)
Journeys for some reason (24:34 - 24:37)
yeah I guess his lightning bolts under (24:39 - 24:42)
his eyes they're a little bit bigger and (24:41 - 24:44)
Lola (24:42 - 24:47)
yeah (24:44 - 24:47)
also I think it's weird to see (24:47 - 24:53)
Ash in 3D (24:50 - 24:53)
oh because it's like his first character (24:54 - 24:57)
model yeah it's like weird to see it as (24:55 - 25:03)
a 3D model in in the master style (24:57 - 25:03)
uh he's here he is definitely here and (25:07 - 25:13)
here be next hopefully (25:10 - 25:15)
you know if mirror B doesn't show up (25:13 - 25:17)
soon I'm gonna get real mad (25:15 - 25:20)
yeah I don't regret asking for this you (25:17 - 25:21)
know I don't regret anything (25:20 - 25:23)
[Laughter] (25:21 - 25:27)
Mira being Ludicolo forever (25:23 - 25:27)
we need to take a break on that note (25:28 - 25:33)
when we come back we're gonna talk about (25:31 - 25:36)
uh Starly Community coming up uh (25:33 - 25:38)
unfortunately we have to talk about this (25:36 - 25:43)
Logan Paul and uh turning this (25:38 - 25:47)
illustrator card into an Abomination (25:43 - 25:50)
um and then uh no we don't why do no we (25:47 - 25:52)
we do because it's the most it is (25:50 - 25:55)
actually the rarest card that exists (25:52 - 25:57)
so (25:55 - 26:00)
we'll be right back (25:57 - 26:05)
and we are back from our break (26:00 - 26:08)
look I (26:05 - 26:10)
hope we live in a world where we never (26:08 - 26:13)
have to talk about Logan Paul I mean I (26:10 - 26:15)
live in that world and then you drag me (26:13 - 26:17)
down (26:15 - 26:17)
this is off Kotaku uh (26:19 - 26:24)
uh so (26:22 - 26:27)
back a couple months ago was a uh was a (26:24 - 26:30)
wrestling event called WrestleMania I (26:27 - 26:33)
was at your house for that will is at my (26:30 - 26:35)
house and I was not because I don't (26:33 - 26:36)
wrestle (26:35 - 26:40)
that's more power to you (26:36 - 26:42)
um and (26:40 - 26:45)
Logan Paul came out to wrestle he he (26:42 - 26:49)
made some deal with WWE right www this (26:45 - 26:50)
is not a new thing for WWE they love (26:49 - 26:53)
their celebrity guest stars because it (26:50 - 26:55)
brings new people to watch (26:53 - 26:58)
who is it bringing that does like I'm (26:55 - 26:59)
pretty sure the Venn diagram of (26:58 - 27:02)
WrestleMania fans and Logan Paul is (26:59 - 27:04)
practically a circle well no they could (27:02 - 27:06)
have gotten a few more that were still (27:04 - 27:08)
on there like the sliver like the (27:06 - 27:11)
crescent Edge squeezing that fan base (27:08 - 27:14)
but anyways he came out to WrestleMania (27:11 - 27:17)
wearing a gold chain (27:14 - 27:18)
um (27:17 - 27:21)
promo illustrator the the Pikachu (27:18 - 27:22)
illustrator card (27:21 - 27:26)
which is there's apparently only like 10 (27:22 - 27:28)
left in the world there was like 40 (27:26 - 27:31)
total they were only given out to art (27:28 - 27:34)
contest people who lived in Japan it's a (27:31 - 27:37)
very rare very very sought after card (27:34 - 27:39)
and that made the headlines in itself (27:37 - 27:41)
most people didn't actually really care (27:39 - 27:42)
that he was at WrestleMania they cared (27:41 - 27:44)
that he had a Pokemon card around his (27:42 - 27:46)
neck (27:44 - 27:46)
so he still has that card right (27:46 - 27:53)
um I mean it's his possession he does (27:50 - 27:58)
own it yes he does own it so now (27:53 - 28:02)
uh okay so I'll we'll go over the (27:58 - 28:04)
article here and kind of catch up what (28:02 - 28:06)
were happening the Pikachu illustrator (28:04 - 28:10)
Pokemon card is from 1998 uh and then it (28:06 - 28:12)
went through PSA grading which gave it a (28:10 - 28:15)
a grading of 10 (28:12 - 28:18)
and then Logan Paul paid (28:15 - 28:23)
5.2 million dollars for this card (28:18 - 28:26)
um and now he's turning that into an nft (28:23 - 28:31)
like every sentence it just gets worse (28:26 - 28:33)
right with every word like we are (28:31 - 28:36)
descending and every it's like a death (28:33 - 28:39)
by a thousand paper cuts I will not (28:36 - 28:41)
survive this article so this is the card (28:39 - 28:45)
he wore out to WrestleMania which WWE (28:41 - 28:47)
made a big deal about it he made a big (28:45 - 28:49)
deal about it news outlets like WWE (28:47 - 28:52)
actually tweeted that he was wearing the (28:49 - 28:56)
official WWE Twitter Twitter (28:52 - 28:56)
he was wearing the most expensive (28:56 - 29:01)
Pokemon card in the world around his (28:59 - 29:03)
neck (29:01 - 29:04)
um (29:03 - 29:08)
and so there is a story to how he got (29:04 - 29:10)
this card because he originally didn't (29:08 - 29:12)
own it another (29:10 - 29:14)
person owned this card (29:12 - 29:16)
and so (29:14 - 29:19)
Logan Paul initially offered that guy (29:16 - 29:22)
four million dollars that guy said no (29:19 - 29:25)
did not want to part with it (29:22 - 29:28)
um and then Logan Paul offered him four (29:25 - 29:32)
million dollars plus a PSA graded nine (29:28 - 29:35)
Pikachu (29:32 - 29:37)
so that that was the deal that ended up (29:35 - 29:39)
happening I mean PSA graded 9 (29:37 - 29:41)
illustrator Pikachu yeah Pikachu (29:39 - 29:43)
illustrator because Logan Paul had an (29:41 - 29:45)
illustrator nine himself and then he (29:43 - 29:47)
traded it plus four million dollars for (29:45 - 29:50)
a PSA graded I mean that's how trades (29:47 - 29:52)
happen that's it's a trading card game (29:50 - 29:55)
he traded cards why did these people (29:52 - 29:58)
have this kind of money and I am (29:55 - 30:01)
struggling to make it day by day (29:58 - 30:03)
wow you know what's funny too is I (30:01 - 30:06)
remember I remember like uh like a year (30:03 - 30:10)
ago we we we joked about how like PSA is (30:06 - 30:12)
just a bunch of people just kind of like (30:10 - 30:15)
eyeing it up and yes they have they have (30:12 - 30:18)
like tools to like and they have (30:15 - 30:19)
guidelines but at the end of the day (30:18 - 30:22)
it's still a human grading your card and (30:19 - 30:25)
and we had we had comments being like (30:22 - 30:27)
you guys don't know anything about PSA (30:25 - 30:29)
it's a very like delicate process like (30:27 - 30:33)
you can literally go on YouTube or Tick (30:29 - 30:36)
Tock or anything watch people get their (30:33 - 30:39)
PSA cards back crack it open send it (30:36 - 30:42)
back to PSA and get a better grade that (30:39 - 30:44)
is a thing that people do they will just (30:42 - 30:47)
keep cracking open their graded cards (30:44 - 30:49)
you send it back because they know (30:47 - 30:51)
eventually another person who probably (30:49 - 30:54)
like had a really bad day at work or (30:51 - 30:56)
maybe they had an amazing day maybe (30:54 - 30:58)
maybe they got engaged the day before (30:56 - 31:00)
and they're just stamping 10 on (30:58 - 31:01)
everything like at the end of the day (31:00 - 31:05)
humans are still determining what is a (31:01 - 31:09)
10 what is a nine what is a 8.5 some (31:05 - 31:11)
companies do like 8.5 (31:09 - 31:13)
um so it's just like he's a 10 but PSA (31:11 - 31:15)
greater than meta nine (31:13 - 31:19)
oh the the thing about three for me well (31:15 - 31:22)
the there's a whole there's a whole (31:19 - 31:25)
nother argument that because these cards (31:22 - 31:29)
are so old that PSA was less strict back (31:25 - 31:30)
then (31:29 - 31:34)
and that's why this card has a 10. (31:30 - 31:37)
but there's probably not that much of a (31:34 - 31:39)
difference between the card he traded (31:37 - 31:42)
that was graded at nine and you could be (31:39 - 31:44)
like well crack it open and set it again (31:42 - 31:46)
but they would probably receive much (31:44 - 31:49)
much lower grades because it is stricter (31:46 - 31:51)
now than it was back in the day that's (31:49 - 31:54)
why no one wants to like that's actually (31:51 - 31:57)
why this 10 is worth so much because in (31:54 - 31:59)
today's standards it's probably not (31:57 - 32:03)
actually a 10. it's probably a nine (31:59 - 32:03)
um (32:03 - 32:05)
which I think is actually probably the (32:03 - 32:06)
more interesting part of this whole (32:05 - 32:09)
Logan Paul thing is just how like (32:06 - 32:12)
the in today's standard that card is (32:09 - 32:14)
probably not a 10. (32:12 - 32:15)
um but (32:14 - 32:18)
it has a 10 on it and it's a it's it's (32:15 - 32:21)
been graded for how long so (32:18 - 32:26)
uh this has gone on to hit Guinness Book (32:21 - 32:28)
of World Records for the most expensive (32:26 - 32:31)
Pokemon Trading Card sold at a private (32:28 - 32:33)
sale (32:31 - 32:35)
um (32:33 - 32:38)
and now (32:35 - 32:39)
uh (32:38 - 32:42)
on July 9th (32:39 - 32:47)
at 3 P.M EST they started a nft on a (32:42 - 32:50)
platform that Logan Paul started or (32:47 - 32:52)
co-founded (32:50 - 32:56)
called liquid Marketplace (32:52 - 32:59)
um so this is a brand new website (32:56 - 33:02)
uh there's not just like anything nft it (32:59 - 33:03)
just popped up one day and you're (33:02 - 33:05)
supposed to give it your money and trust (33:03 - 33:08)
that it will exist in like a year it was (33:05 - 33:11)
so their mission liquid what's the (33:08 - 33:13)
website liquid Marketplace their mission (33:11 - 33:17)
is to dog it is going to infect your (33:13 - 33:20)
computer they're going to be tracking (33:17 - 33:21)
you (33:20 - 33:24)
their mission uh is uh to offer (33:21 - 33:27)
collectors the opportunity to co-own (33:24 - 33:30)
physical and digital assets through the (33:27 - 33:33)
power of tokenization (33:30 - 33:35)
um I mean there's other companies that (33:33 - 33:39)
do similar things all right it's all bad (33:35 - 33:43)
so you can so there are 50 million (33:39 - 33:47)
tokens available to buy this Pikachu at (33:43 - 33:50)
10 cents a pop (33:47 - 33:53)
um Logan Paul claims that uh he will be (33:50 - 33:55)
in the minority of ownership and he will (33:53 - 33:59)
only own 49 of the card Abby okay hold (33:55 - 34:00)
on (33:59 - 34:03)
he still physically has the card yes (34:00 - 34:06)
correct so I believe the Finders Keepers (34:03 - 34:09)
losers weepers rule applies here because (34:06 - 34:12)
he actually owns 100 of the card and you (34:09 - 34:16)
own nothing you own air (34:12 - 34:19)
uh isn't this the same as like owning a (34:16 - 34:20)
football team like like I don't know (34:19 - 34:23)
anything about sports but can't you like (34:20 - 34:26)
buy stock and then say like you're an (34:23 - 34:28)
owner of the Packers now only the (34:26 - 34:31)
Packers do that kind of ridiculous thing (34:28 - 34:33)
they're like oh wait that's only a (34:31 - 34:34)
Packers thing that's not like other (34:33 - 34:36)
football yeah that's more like I think (34:34 - 34:38)
it's like the city of Green Bay (34:36 - 34:41)
owns Oh I thought that was you said (34:38 - 34:43)
somebody who grew up in Wisconsin I (34:41 - 34:45)
thought like every sports team did that (34:43 - 34:47)
no (34:45 - 34:49)
I guess but that's like that's like the (34:47 - 34:51)
same scam right in (34:49 - 34:54)
the Vikings (34:51 - 34:55)
football team (34:54 - 34:57)
question Google yeah I just thought that (34:55 - 34:59)
was every sports team that people buy (34:57 - 35:02)
into the sports team (34:59 - 35:05)
okay so he oh he said he will own 49 of (35:02 - 35:09)
the card the rest will be crowd whatever (35:05 - 35:11)
crowd scammed (35:09 - 35:13)
um he will be able to still wear it at (35:11 - 35:16)
wrestlemanias oh wait hold on oh he can (35:13 - 35:19)
only wear it to more wrestlemanias if (35:16 - 35:22)
the majority of token holders allow him (35:19 - 35:25)
to what doesn't matter okay what does (35:22 - 35:26)
that look like an email going out to (35:25 - 35:28)
everybody please vote (35:26 - 35:31)
no no it could be like very much like (35:28 - 35:34)
with my stocks that I own the the (35:31 - 35:37)
company that I use to do my stock trades (35:34 - 35:39)
sends me the notification when it's time (35:37 - 35:41)
to vote on something (35:39 - 35:44)
and I I like just log in there and I (35:41 - 35:46)
submit my votes through that application (35:44 - 35:48)
but doesn't he only need two percent of (35:46 - 35:51)
the vote because he owns 49 of it (35:48 - 35:54)
[Applause] (35:51 - 35:57)
loophole right isn't that not how it (35:54 - 35:59)
works I mean it depends on what the (35:57 - 36:01)
contract looks like that people are (35:59 - 36:05)
signing into if the contract says the (36:01 - 36:08)
majority of non (36:05 - 36:12)
Logan Paul stakeholders have to approve (36:08 - 36:16)
then no not just two percent (36:12 - 36:16)
I mean it says in the article if the (36:18 - 36:23)
majority of token holders which would (36:20 - 36:24)
not (36:23 - 36:26)
be himself (36:24 - 36:29)
that would have to be 26 percent of the (36:26 - 36:34)
what 50 well 50 of the 50 yes now would (36:29 - 36:38)
have to be 51 of the 51. 51 right yes (36:34 - 36:40)
and look (36:38 - 36:44)
if you're if you're doing anything with (36:40 - 36:46)
Logan Paul at this point you've admitted (36:44 - 36:50)
you let Logan Paul do anything so what (36:46 - 36:53)
people who are getting yeah I would I (36:50 - 36:54)
would assume that if you're buying into (36:53 - 36:56)
this it's not because you care about the (36:54 - 36:58)
Pikachu it's because you care about him (36:56 - 36:59)
as a person right (36:58 - 37:03)
like I I think that like I I guess this (36:59 - 37:05)
article like strikes the nerve with me (37:03 - 37:07)
not necessarily because like I dislike (37:05 - 37:09)
Logan Paul but that's that's fine that (37:07 - 37:11)
that doesn't matter like I just think (37:09 - 37:13)
that this card (37:11 - 37:16)
probably deserves to be in a museum or (37:13 - 37:20)
or somewhere else that isn't like (37:16 - 37:20)
Gathering 10 cents from people to like (37:21 - 37:26)
private artwork has existed forever (37:26 - 37:30)
right like when somebody dies suddenly (37:28 - 37:32)
all these paintings that we thought were (37:30 - 37:34)
missing forever get donated to museums (37:32 - 37:37)
right like this is a much more public (37:34 - 37:38)
way of saying I have this thing that (37:37 - 37:41)
probably should be on display somewhere (37:38 - 37:43)
and like a Hall of Famer thing but I'm (37:41 - 37:45)
gonna own it and tell but this also does (37:43 - 37:49)
this exists for like normal like oil (37:45 - 37:50)
paintings and stuff you can get (37:49 - 37:52)
fractional ownership of oil paintings (37:50 - 37:54)
now (37:52 - 37:57)
terrible idea (37:54 - 37:59)
but yeah I mean I don't see like I (37:57 - 38:02)
cannot imagine there are a ton of (37:59 - 38:06)
Pokemon fans are like I want to own one (38:02 - 38:08)
billionth of a nft (38:06 - 38:10)
um I know there's a lot of Milwaukee (38:08 - 38:13)
people that want to own the Packers (38:10 - 38:16)
yeah but that's Sports and we know that (38:13 - 38:19)
that is a wild Universe of itself (38:16 - 38:22)
uh (38:19 - 38:22)
there so the the other (38:23 - 38:30)
side of this coin I guess is there is no (38:26 - 38:34)
regulation at all with nfts uh yeah it's (38:30 - 38:37)
one of the problems (38:34 - 38:41)
so it's it's I wonder if there's a point (38:37 - 38:44)
where (38:41 - 38:44)
like the Pokemon company or Nintendo (38:45 - 38:49)
steps in and they're like you can't do (38:47 - 38:52)
this with Rip but I don't (38:49 - 38:54)
no no because it's a physical item yeah (38:52 - 38:57)
like yeah but here's the thing items so (38:54 - 38:59)
they have no ownership rights over it (38:57 - 39:03)
once he's made money off of you (38:59 - 39:06)
there is no guarantee that when he is (39:03 - 39:07)
feeling that he needs views or (39:06 - 39:10)
controversy he is not going to destroy (39:07 - 39:13)
this card (39:10 - 39:13)
yeah you are literally trusting a person (39:13 - 39:17)
that has done (39:16 - 39:21)
very questionable things for views I (39:17 - 39:23)
mean he's also sat on talk shows and (39:21 - 39:25)
said I've done these questionable things (39:23 - 39:27)
because I knew that I knew they would (39:25 - 39:30)
get views yeah so you are trusting a (39:27 - 39:33)
person that has (39:30 - 39:36)
questionable ethics that he is going to (39:33 - 39:40)
keep this very expensive card in this (39:36 - 39:42)
condition and you're going to be able to (39:40 - 39:45)
make money off of it like (39:42 - 39:48)
even if you trusted nfts which is a (39:45 - 39:50)
questionable thing to begin with you (39:48 - 39:52)
should not probably trust Logan Paul to (39:50 - 39:55)
keep his word about any of this that (39:52 - 39:56)
that's that's probably that's a part of (39:55 - 39:57)
the article we didn't really talk about (39:56 - 40:00)
the why would you want to buy in (39:57 - 40:02)
the reason you would want to buy a token (40:00 - 40:04)
which costs 10 cents (40:02 - 40:09)
is the the concept is I'm buying into (40:04 - 40:12)
this card that will (40:09 - 40:15)
should is the key word get more (40:12 - 40:18)
expensive with time and then at a (40:15 - 40:21)
certain point if I feel like the card is (40:18 - 40:25)
Peak expensive I can sell my tokens to (40:21 - 40:28)
somebody else and make a profit (40:25 - 40:28)
that's ideally why you would buy it it's (40:29 - 40:35)
it's a bad stock market or you would buy (40:32 - 40:37)
in to say what people in Milwaukee say (40:35 - 40:39)
is like oh I own (40:37 - 40:43)
.0002 percent of the Green Bay Packers (40:39 - 40:43)
you could tell somebody you own yay (40:44 - 40:49)
you you (40:48 - 40:53)
[Laughter] (40:49 - 40:53)
it's (40:53 - 40:57)
it's this is probably not the first (40:55 - 40:59)
thing he's gonna this is the first thing (40:57 - 41:01)
he's putting up on liquid marketplace (40:59 - 41:04)
right not the first so yeah this is not (41:01 - 41:05)
the last thing he's probably gonna put (41:04 - 41:07)
up (41:05 - 41:07)
make your own choices I don't know I'm (41:09 - 41:13)
just here to make better choices I'm (41:11 - 41:16)
just the middleman here enjoy July (41:13 - 41:18)
Community Day meetups in select cities (41:16 - 41:20)
okay so we know Starley Community Day is (41:18 - 41:22)
coming up uh the Niantic has released (41:20 - 41:25)
the list of cities that are being (41:22 - 41:27)
um the in-person meetups I tried to go (41:25 - 41:29)
to one of these in St Louis (41:27 - 41:31)
and then it thunderstormed and they (41:29 - 41:32)
canceled that event (41:31 - 41:34)
um I did still have a very good time in (41:32 - 41:38)
St Louis uh but (41:34 - 41:38)
they have picked some more cities here (41:38 - 41:44)
and uh Mall of America is one of them (41:42 - 41:47)
this time so (41:44 - 41:48)
uh that is an in-person activation (41:47 - 41:51)
catalino Square in Milwaukee is one of (41:48 - 41:52)
them that's where I used to play (41:51 - 41:56)
Milwaukee Mega daily daily park in (41:52 - 41:59)
Chicago if you're in Denver that is the (41:56 - 42:01)
29th Street Mall (41:59 - 42:04)
in Colorado the seaport in New York the (42:01 - 42:07)
Wharf in the DC hey will you never took (42:04 - 42:08)
me to the wharf (42:07 - 42:11)
why would you go there (42:08 - 42:14)
you lived in DC there's nothing there (42:11 - 42:16)
now (42:14 - 42:18)
wait is that you sure it's the wharf (42:16 - 42:20)
yeah (42:18 - 42:22)
that's where they're doing it that seems (42:20 - 42:24)
really strange because there's a lot of (42:22 - 42:27)
better places (42:24 - 42:27)
um (42:32 - 42:36)
the shops that Braven in Washington uh (42:32 - 42:38)
you can go to Pokemon (42:36 - 42:40)
go.pokemongolive.com to see if there's (42:38 - 42:43)
in-person activations (42:40 - 42:43)
read after Colorado again (42:44 - 42:47)
what the wharf the seaport in New York (42:48 - 42:54)
the Wharf in DC okay (42:50 - 42:54)
uh I don't know if there's a Rhyme or (42:54 - 43:02)
Reason to some of these locations (42:58 - 43:04)
keep in mind that there was not an (43:02 - 43:07)
in-person activation in Ohio during the (43:04 - 43:10)
weekend of the world the U.S (43:07 - 43:12)
championships where out of all places (43:10 - 43:13)
there should have been one there should (43:12 - 43:17)
have been pretty okay (43:13 - 43:17)
uh when you go to these in-person (43:17 - 43:21)
activations though um they're not (43:19 - 43:23)
Niantic employees although I'm sure (43:21 - 43:24)
there are maybe one or two Niantic (43:23 - 43:26)
employees there but they do the thing (43:24 - 43:29)
that Nintendo does or other companies do (43:26 - 43:32)
is they hire people in the area for the (43:29 - 43:35)
weekend they pay them like 20 bucks an (43:32 - 43:37)
hour it's like an easy side gig for (43:35 - 43:40)
people (43:37 - 43:40)
um (43:40 - 43:43)
and you know when you get those kind of (43:41 - 43:46)
employees it's very Hit or Miss weather (43:43 - 43:49)
they're going to do their job (43:46 - 43:51)
when I was in Berlin the Niantic (43:49 - 43:53)
employees were wearing blue shirts and (43:51 - 43:55)
the uh (43:53 - 43:58)
German for higher employees were wearing (43:55 - 44:01)
green shirts and the green shirts kind (43:58 - 44:03)
of just sometimes didn't care (44:01 - 44:08)
they're like they're not paid to care (44:03 - 44:10)
um so I guess we'll finally see what (44:08 - 44:12)
this in-person activation will be like (44:10 - 44:14)
um and they're doing it at Mall of (44:12 - 44:17)
America which makes me S assume that (44:14 - 44:21)
mall America was like okay Niantic (44:17 - 44:21)
you're allowed to (44:21 - 44:25)
like mall America has had issues with (44:23 - 44:27)
Pokemon go players in the past yeah in (44:25 - 44:28)
this instance they would have had to (44:27 - 44:31)
make a deal with Niantic yeah so Niantic (44:28 - 44:33)
probably paid the fees to have an event (44:31 - 44:36)
at their event at their Mall yes I don't (44:33 - 44:38)
think though the Niantic Booth's gonna (44:36 - 44:40)
be in the center of the mall I think (44:38 - 44:41)
they said it said it's going to be in a (44:40 - 44:43)
parking lot (44:41 - 44:46)
North lot (44:43 - 44:46)
so is that actually the parking lot or (44:46 - 44:51)
is North Lot a part of (44:48 - 44:53)
I don't know what that means oh are they (44:51 - 44:56)
doing that again so when (44:53 - 45:00)
the mall tour happened (44:56 - 45:00)
a million years ago now you're talking (45:01 - 45:04)
about remember (45:03 - 45:08)
no it was before that (45:04 - 45:08)
um (45:08 - 45:12)
was it the Pokemon rocks Mall tour (45:08 - 45:15)
could have been that they actually (45:12 - 45:18)
sectioned off an entire section of the (45:15 - 45:22)
parking lot that's the flat part (45:18 - 45:25)
I heard that this is the Pokemon event (45:22 - 45:28)
so nobody could park there (45:25 - 45:30)
they just out loud them to set (45:28 - 45:33)
everything up in that parking area I (45:30 - 45:34)
don't know what they're setting up (45:33 - 45:37)
besides like a booth I mean who knows (45:34 - 45:40)
but also there's not a lot of flat (45:37 - 45:42)
parking left (45:40 - 45:45)
uh so I'm very curious (45:42 - 45:48)
I I guarantee it is probably outside (45:45 - 45:51)
ah since it does say North lot (45:48 - 45:53)
um it's probably a section to off area (45:51 - 45:55)
that people aren't allowed to park in so (45:53 - 45:58)
that people can gather outside (45:55 - 45:58)
yeah I guess I guess we'll find out (45:59 - 46:07)
uh with Starly Community looks like (46:03 - 46:08)
um (46:07 - 46:12)
I did a bonus podcast about my thoughts (46:08 - 46:14)
in Berlin Germany I did that with Bobby (46:12 - 46:17)
because Bobby's supposedly he tells me (46:14 - 46:19)
that he's going to Seattle so he asked (46:17 - 46:21)
questions about it like what to expect (46:19 - 46:23)
what he should expect (46:21 - 46:24)
um a really good question that he asked (46:23 - 46:26)
was um was there like different (46:24 - 46:28)
challenges like a hard easy medium I (46:26 - 46:30)

bucks a month I do have a question yes (47:00 - 47:06)
why are your feet so pure and delicate (47:03 - 47:10)
like a baby's newborn skin I want 57 (47:06 - 47:13)
miles in three days I've run marathons (47:10 - 47:14)
and didn't come out with a blister I (47:13 - 47:16)
don't know what is wrong with your feet (47:14 - 47:19)
I think at a certain point my shoes just (47:16 - 47:20)
broke (47:19 - 47:24)
what does that mean right (47:20 - 47:27)
like did The Arches fall I think so (47:24 - 47:29)
like they like they went from feeling (47:27 - 47:31)
like supportive to like feeling spongy (47:29 - 47:34)
in like a second (47:31 - 47:36)
I I have to fill out a warranty form for (47:34 - 47:37)
the shoes (47:36 - 47:40)
also was I wrong about (47:37 - 47:44)
Germany feeling like your hometown (47:40 - 47:44)
yeah I mean like like (47:45 - 47:50)
do others the US states not have like (47:48 - 47:52)
bratwurst and stuff (47:50 - 47:56)
I mean Milwaukee is the German city (47:52 - 47:58)
right very much so they've pretty much (47:56 - 48:03)
directly came from Germany to Milwaukee (47:58 - 48:03)
yeah I felt like a lot of things on the (48:06 - 48:10)
menu were here is some sort of meat with (48:07 - 48:14)
a sauce yeah German food (48:10 - 48:14)
I had a really banging Pizza though (48:15 - 48:20)
I had I had a real good slice of pizza (48:18 - 48:23)
no pizza in Germany I was told there was (48:20 - 48:26)
no tacos in Germany (48:23 - 48:28)
that not that I went out of my way to (48:26 - 48:29)
search for tacos but I was told there (48:28 - 48:31)
was no tacos (48:29 - 48:33)
are there other burgers or did you have (48:31 - 48:36)
to go to Hamburg (48:33 - 48:36)
I believe I I had I had a mega Burger (48:37 - 48:42)
thank you very much Greg (48:40 - 48:44)
did you have a Berliner (48:42 - 48:46)
no just the mega Burger it was it was (48:44 - 48:48)
probably the saddest Burger I've ever (48:46 - 48:50)
had it made McDonald's look like a (48:48 - 48:52)
million bucks also the McDonald's in (48:50 - 48:54)
Germany slapped very good hey Berliner (48:52 - 48:58)
is a donut yes oh I had (48:54 - 49:00)
um I had a donut that's true I don't (48:58 - 49:01)
think it was a Berliner it was just like (49:00 - 49:02)
a (49:01 - 49:05)
donut with chocolate frosting (49:02 - 49:07)
I think a Berliner is a jelly donut as (49:05 - 49:09)
far as yeah (49:07 - 49:12)
um I I did sit next to John Henke for (49:09 - 49:15)
quite a while (49:12 - 49:15)
um (49:15 - 49:17)
what was that (49:18 - 49:21)
I said yeah you guys awesome best (49:20 - 49:23)
friends now yeah yeah (49:21 - 49:25)
I didn't ask him what level he was for (49:23 - 49:28)
Pokemon go he I don't I don't think any (49:25 - 49:30)
of that is NDA I don't actually know um (49:28 - 49:32)
he was very nice (49:30 - 49:34)
um I did meet John Henke originally at (49:32 - 49:36)
the first Pokemon go Fest (49:34 - 49:39)
where he sat out on stage for eight (49:36 - 49:40)
hours and talked to everyone do you (49:39 - 49:42)
remember that well where I do I remember (49:40 - 49:45)
hearing about it (49:42 - 49:46)
um (49:45 - 49:49)
he uh we we had like a content creator (49:46 - 49:52)
dinner or whatever at a beer garden and (49:49 - 49:54)
then he showed up and he sat down and he (49:52 - 49:55)
talked to us (49:54 - 49:59)
um he was very obsessed with ar glasses (49:55 - 50:02)
and I know Niantic has shown off AR (49:59 - 50:03)
glasses before and they're making their (50:02 - 50:06)
own thing and supposedly apple is as (50:03 - 50:08)
well yeah and I think Google is making (50:06 - 50:11)
theirs and everyone is but he was he was (50:08 - 50:14)
very obsessed with uh like AR games and (50:11 - 50:17)
AR glasses in particular which (50:14 - 50:20)
is should not be surprising since (50:17 - 50:24)
Niantic is also an AR company I mean (50:20 - 50:24)
um he talked a little bit about parrot (50:24 - 50:29)
peridot and how like (50:27 - 50:32)
unlike so like Pokemon go (50:29 - 50:34)
um like you can have like a Pikachu come (50:32 - 50:35)
out and then it's like on the ground (50:34 - 50:37)
right but in like Peridot like the (50:35 - 50:40)
creatures will learn the environment (50:37 - 50:41)
so I don't know if you guys ever saw (50:40 - 50:43)
some of their videos they post on (50:41 - 50:45)
Instagram like there's a Peridot that (50:43 - 50:48)
like comes out of the toilet because it (50:45 - 50:49)
like knows (50:48 - 50:51)
because like you look at the toilet and (50:49 - 50:53)
like knows it's a toilet so like because (50:51 - 50:55)
it sees that as water are there ways to (50:53 - 50:58)
throw out peridots after they've gone (50:55 - 51:01)
places to come back from like the (50:58 - 51:03)
peridots are like supposed to be smart (51:01 - 51:05)
enough to know the the things in the (51:03 - 51:08)
world because it's scanning the terrain (51:05 - 51:12)
the the room textures yeah yeah (51:08 - 51:14)
um (51:12 - 51:16)
so he he talked a little bit about (51:14 - 51:17)
Peridot (51:16 - 51:18)
um (51:17 - 51:20)
he I mean like he it was like very it (51:18 - 51:21)
was a very like (51:20 - 51:23)
I don't want to say generic conversation (51:21 - 51:25)
it was like (51:23 - 51:27)
how did you let go Fest have you been to (51:25 - 51:29)
the other go fests like what did you (51:27 - 51:31)
like what did you not like (51:29 - 51:33)
um and there's a bunch of creators so it (51:31 - 51:35)
was kind of like you didn't really make (51:33 - 51:37)
it like if it was a one-on-one (51:35 - 51:39)
conversation right in like an hour you'd (51:37 - 51:40)
be like oh we made progress but since (51:39 - 51:42)
there were so many people (51:40 - 51:45)
it didn't really go anywhere I mean he (51:42 - 51:48)
he did when he asked me what my favorite (51:45 - 51:52)
part of go Fest was I said (51:48 - 51:54)
that do you know this whole conversation (51:52 - 51:56)
that I'm about to say reminds me of that (51:54 - 51:58)
time where that person was like I sat on (51:56 - 52:00)
the plane next to John hanky yeah (51:58 - 52:03)
this is the thing (52:00 - 52:05)
um (52:03 - 52:07)
I said that my favorite part of go Fest (52:05 - 52:10)
was the unknown would spawn on the hour (52:07 - 52:12)
every hour for two minutes (52:10 - 52:14)
so when you were at Berlin when it hit (52:12 - 52:16)
one o'clock all the spawns would (52:14 - 52:18)
disappear and then unknown would spawn (52:16 - 52:21)
in and then for 120 seconds they would (52:18 - 52:22)
be there and then they would disappear (52:21 - 52:24)
and then everything would go away and (52:22 - 52:26)
this actually first happened in Sevilla (52:24 - 52:28)
at the Safari Zone where I can't (52:26 - 52:30)
remember what they're called like waves (52:28 - 52:33)
or mobs or something but a core fish (52:30 - 52:34)
would spawn in for two minutes and then (52:33 - 52:36)
disappear and then I was like oh this (52:34 - 52:38)
when he was like what's her favorite (52:36 - 52:39)
part of go Fest I was like oh that's my (52:38 - 52:40)
favorite part and he's like okay that's (52:39 - 52:43)
good to know (52:40 - 52:43)
um I (52:43 - 52:48)
the one question that stood out to me (52:45 - 52:49)
that I can't remember if I asked or (52:48 - 52:52)
somebody else asked they said what if (52:49 - 52:53)
there was one thing you could change in (52:52 - 52:55)
Pokemon go right now what would you (52:53 - 52:59)
change and I think he had a really good (52:55 - 53:00)
answer (52:59 - 53:03)
um but he he said that the one thing he (53:00 - 53:05)
would change is to make Pokemon not feel (53:03 - 53:08)
like static spawns (53:05 - 53:10)
he's like I he's like I don't like that (53:08 - 53:12)
a Pokemon just pops in out of nowhere (53:10 - 53:15)
and then eventually disappears it (53:12 - 53:17)
doesn't move around doesn't yeah yeah (53:15 - 53:21)
there's no chase oh I see I see (53:17 - 53:23)
um and he said that he wanted (53:21 - 53:27)
Pokemon and I think he also said um he (53:23 - 53:29)
Pokemon company feels this way as well (53:27 - 53:32)
they want Pokemon to feel like living (53:29 - 53:33)
creatures (53:32 - 53:36)
and so like a Pokemon just materializing (53:33 - 53:38)
out of nowhere and popping in and then (53:36 - 53:40)
just eventually disappearing doesn't (53:38 - 53:42)
like he wants to make that feel more (53:40 - 53:46)
organic natural (53:42 - 53:47)
um (53:46 - 53:48)
and I was like that's a pretty good (53:47 - 53:50)
answer I don't think that I don't think (53:48 - 53:52)
that's going to make anyone happy if (53:50 - 53:53)
they're upset about incense or Raid pass (53:52 - 53:55)
prices but like (53:53 - 53:58)
it's it's like a cool Vision that like (53:55 - 54:00)
oh maybe in five years we can get there (53:58 - 54:02)
maybe in like when we open the app we (54:00 - 54:04)
can see like Pokemon just kind of walk (54:02 - 54:06)
in and walk out and it's just not like (54:04 - 54:09)
oh Pikachu spawned all right in a minute (54:06 - 54:11)
Pikachu's gonna despawn like (54:09 - 54:14)
I get where he was going with that (54:11 - 54:15)
um so that was that was like a really (54:14 - 54:16)
like (54:15 - 54:19)
cool you have like a vision for what you (54:16 - 54:20)
want to actually see what this game is (54:19 - 54:22)
going to be in a couple years (54:20 - 54:24)
I don't think it's gonna go the Harry (54:22 - 54:26)
Potter route into something like close (54:24 - 54:29)
no no no no (54:26 - 54:31)
um yeah but it was it was a lot of him (54:29 - 54:33)
like talking about you know hopefully (54:31 - 54:37)
one day you know people will (54:33 - 54:39)
connect with ar glasses and like that AR (54:37 - 54:42)
the air the AR glasses thing is so far (54:39 - 54:43)
out at this point (54:42 - 54:44)
like (54:43 - 54:47)
costs aside (54:44 - 54:49)
cost is probably the biggest thing but (54:47 - 54:52)
like most AR glasses last like what like (54:49 - 54:53)
20 minutes on your head before the (54:52 - 54:56)
battery dies (54:53 - 54:58)
uh my Google Glass lasted longer than (54:56 - 55:00)
that but you didn't have it on all the (54:58 - 55:01)
time right (55:00 - 55:04)
yeah so if you're playing like Pokemon (55:01 - 55:06)
go I yeah I don't even know how that (55:04 - 55:08)
looks but (55:06 - 55:11)
did he have anything to say about uh (55:08 - 55:15)
staff reductions project closures no no (55:11 - 55:19)
one asked him about that interesting (55:15 - 55:19)
uh he didn't say anything about that (55:20 - 55:27)
um somebody asked him if (55:23 - 55:29)
uh if there would be like a new Pokeball (55:27 - 55:31)
plus thing (55:29 - 55:33)
and he said oh no we're not like working (55:31 - 55:35)
on anything (55:33 - 55:37)
um and then he kind of mentioned that (55:35 - 55:38)
like oh it kind of like (55:37 - 55:40)
Auto catching kind of just takes away (55:38 - 55:42)
the fun of Pokemon go (55:40 - 55:44)
incorrect (55:42 - 55:47)
[Laughter] (55:44 - 55:49)
kind of like if you go back to his (55:47 - 55:53)
vision as like Pokemon being like this (55:49 - 55:55)
um like these creatures that come in and (55:53 - 55:57)
come out and they're like supposed to (55:55 - 55:59)
fit in the world like treating them like (55:57 - 56:00)
oh I'm just I'm just catching them for (55:59 - 56:03)
XP and stardust like they're actually (56:00 - 56:06)
nothing to me is like I get it like (56:03 - 56:08)
of course anyone who's like super grind (56:06 - 56:10)
heavy would be like oh like I guess I (56:08 - 56:12)
get I understand both sides right like (56:10 - 56:15)
you want to make a game that like has a (56:12 - 56:16)
grind and has an end goal but you also (56:15 - 56:18)
want to make a game that like feels (56:16 - 56:20)
organic and natural in like a real world (56:18 - 56:22)
that you can go to like (56:20 - 56:25)
there's always that weird balance of of (56:22 - 56:29)
conflicting things he was nice though (56:25 - 56:31)
um it was like cool to like (56:29 - 56:32)
ask him a couple questions and for him (56:31 - 56:34)
to like respond (56:32 - 56:36)
um there was like a couple times I think (56:34 - 56:37)
somebody asked them like questions about (56:36 - 56:38)
something he was like I actually don't (56:37 - 56:39)
know the answer to that and he's like (56:38 - 56:42)
he's like here's my email you can email (56:39 - 56:44)
me and I'll you know when I get back to (56:42 - 56:47)
the office I can figure it out for you (56:44 - 56:47)
um (56:49 - 56:52)
but yeah uh that was that was a cool (56:50 - 56:54)
experience (56:52 - 56:54)
um (56:55 - 56:57)

I get my Pokemon Go News yes it was the (58:20 - 58:26)
ultra I think both I think the the Team (58:23 - 58:28)
Rocket and the pants here were both (58:26 - 58:30)
under the ultra unlocked bonus we're (58:28 - 58:33)

Mankey but it's more like a pig monkey (58:59 - 59:03)
yeah (59:02 - 59:06)
Chimchar is real cute yeah Jim turns (59:03 - 59:08)
cute (59:06 - 59:08)
the problem is all the monkeys evolve (59:09 - 59:12)
into apes and then you can't pick them (59:11 - 59:15)
anymore (59:12 - 59:15)
they don't evolve into Apes they stay (59:25 - 59:30)
monkeys that's true but no one likes (59:28 - 59:34)
those I do like them (59:30 - 59:36)
and I am someone (59:34 - 59:39)
and (59:36 - 59:39)
Sage is the best of those three because (59:41 - 59:47)
he has broccoli on his head (59:44 - 59:49)

broccoli (59:49 - 59:54)
once have you ever ate a broccoli I had (59:51 - 59:55)

that I have broccoli like three to four (60:02 - 60:06)
times a week and he's like I had it two (60:04 - 60:10)
years ago I had a vegetable once (60:06 - 60:12)
my body has never recovered from the (60:10 - 60:15)
incident (60:12 - 60:18)

Pokemon of the week (61:50 - 61:55)
that we don't that was one question (61:52 - 61:57)
isn't there YouTube (61:55 - 61:59)
probably I looked at YouTube there was (61:57 - 62:02)
no question uh you guys prompted for a (61:59 - 62:04)
question well here if you're watching on (62:02 - 62:07)
YouTube people leave questions all that (62:04 - 62:08)
they know it's a thing you don't have to (62:07 - 62:10)
prompt every time for people you have to (62:08 - 62:11)
prompt for YouTube watch watch if you (62:10 - 62:12)
made it this far in the YouTube video (62:11 - 62:15)
hit the like button hit the Subscribe (62:12 - 62:18)
ask a question for next week I guarantee (62:15 - 62:21)
you if I go to last week's video (62:18 - 62:26)
I am adding a rule okay for both YouTube (62:21 - 62:29)
and other sources of questions (62:26 - 62:33)
it has to have a relatively simple (62:29 - 62:34)
answer (62:33 - 62:36)
so if your question and Greg you're (62:34 - 62:37)
going to see it if you go to the YouTube (62:36 - 62:40)
questions is how would you rewrite the (62:37 - 62:43)
story of Pokemon sword and shield oh yes (62:40 - 62:49)
yeah I ain't got time for I mean that no (62:43 - 62:52)
I appreciate your curiosity and wonder (62:49 - 62:53)
but (62:52 - 62:57)
no how would you fix the entire villain (62:53 - 63:00)
Arc throughout there yeah there's a (62:57 - 63:03)
second uh question of the week (63:00 - 63:05)
why is Will so handsome well it's (63:03 - 63:08)
partially genetics partially cosmetics (63:05 - 63:10)
how much doof could a beedoof doof of a (63:08 - 63:14)
beetle could have doof this does not fit (63:10 - 63:16)
Will's rule (63:14 - 63:18)
no it's the answer is six produce or six (63:16 - 63:21)
Deuce it's produced all the way down (63:18 - 63:24)
all right last week's Pokemon something (63:21 - 63:27)
to do with Fourth of July Unova Galler (63:24 - 63:30)
uh and I said the Pokemon who could (63:27 - 63:31)
originally only be found in the wild (63:30 - 63:34)
with its hidden ability had to be given (63:31 - 63:36)
a piece of candy to become catchable one (63:34 - 63:38)
characteristic it shares a (63:36 - 63:40)
cross-regional forms is the potential to (63:38 - 63:43)
be fire type (63:40 - 63:43)
I wrote something down I don't know if (63:44 - 63:47)
it's right but we're gonna go with it (63:46 - 63:49)
it's (63:47 - 63:51)
kombi no (63:49 - 63:55)
it's darmanitan darmanitan is correct (63:51 - 63:59)
hey I didn't ability Zen mode gallerian (63:55 - 64:03)
darmanitan is ice fire (63:59 - 64:05)
which I think is the only ice fire (64:03 - 64:07)
Pokemon in existence (64:05 - 64:09)
I think most people have forgotten this (64:07 - 64:11)
Pokemon exists (64:09 - 64:15)
the Zen mode ice fire one (64:11 - 64:17)
but it's just our manitan with the (64:15 - 64:18)
hidden ability (64:17 - 64:20)
and gather (64:18 - 64:22)
I like diamond used to have one of my (64:20 - 64:24)
favorite TCG cards that you couldn't use (64:22 - 64:26)
it was darmaxatan was the name of the (64:24 - 64:30)
attack it was nice (64:26 - 64:30)
I would also argue that darmanitan is (64:31 - 64:35)
potentially a monkey (64:33 - 64:35)
yeah that's fair (64:37 - 64:41)
dang I didn't know Darman 10 is 135 base (64:39 - 64:42)
speed (64:41 - 64:45)
it's fast (64:42 - 64:45)
it's our man to hit a monkey (64:46 - 64:53)
I it kind of has monkey looking features (64:48 - 64:53)
I have to look at it now (64:55 - 64:59)
yeah (65:01 - 65:03)
um (65:03 - 65:07)
yeah I would say yes (65:03 - 65:07)
is there any darmana tan trivia (65:10 - 65:17)
wait Darlington only turns into the Zen (65:13 - 65:20)
mode when it's less than 50 HP yeah you (65:17 - 65:23)
have to have the hidden ability yeah (65:20 - 65:26)
oh I don't know how that worked (65:23 - 65:29)
uh a it's got a good Shuffle icon (65:26 - 65:31)
B (65:29 - 65:34)
it has a good shiny (65:31 - 65:35)
I'm trying to see if there's something (65:34 - 65:38)
that says what it's based off of (65:35 - 65:39)
oh well you know it seems to be based (65:38 - 65:42)
off of a uh DaRuMa doll and an orangutan (65:39 - 65:46)
and orangutan fits in there somewhere (65:42 - 65:46)
uh no Pokemon has the same uh type (65:46 - 65:51)
combination as galerian Zen mode Darman (65:49 - 65:54)
attempt Valerian Darman 10 is the only (65:51 - 65:56)
Regional form Pokemon with an (65:54 - 65:57)
alternative form (65:56 - 66:01)
eunovian Zen mode darn manitan is the (65:57 - 66:03)
only alternative form revealed at the (66:01 - 66:06)
time that does not appear in Pokemon (66:03 - 66:09)
Super Mystery Dungeon that well who's (66:06 - 66:11)
writing this trivia that is a wild piece (66:09 - 66:14)
of trivia right there unknown Zen uh (66:11 - 66:17)
unknown eunovian and said mode darmana (66:14 - 66:19)
10 is tied with Litwick for the lowest (66:17 - 66:22)
base attack stat of all fire Pokemon (66:19 - 66:25)
gallerian Zen mode Darman tan has the (66:22 - 66:28)
highest speed of all ice type and fire (66:25 - 66:30)
type Pokemon wow dang (66:28 - 66:34)
um both of unovian darmanitans forms (66:30 - 66:38)
were designed by Mana EB (66:34 - 66:38)
um who made Victini Herdier (66:39 - 66:45)
daramaka darmanitan frillish Jellison (66:42 - 66:47)
Axew fracture Haxorus stunfisk and (66:45 - 66:50)
klefki (66:47 - 66:53)
that's a good uh that's good (66:50 - 66:56)
good amount of Pokemon I think I'm a big (66:53 - 66:57)

this dark type Pokemon has only been (67:14 - 67:19)
able to be caught in the wild without (67:17 - 67:22)
the use of a special item in two games (67:19 - 67:25)
Pokemon emerald and Pokemon X (67:22 - 67:28)
all other times it had to be evolved (67:25 - 67:30)
into traded in or a special item or (67:28 - 67:33)
location had to be used slash unlocked (67:30 - 67:36)
