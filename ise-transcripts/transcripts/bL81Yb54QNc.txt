what is the correct term for (1:38 - 1:43)
uh something that is both an (1:41 - 1:45)
announcement and a scold (1:43 - 1:48)
uh guten announcement no that's (1:45 - 1:52)
like i don't know either way listeners (1:48 - 1:55)
dearest listeners and that's please take (1:52 - 1:56)
that with as much sarcasm (1:55 - 2:00)
as possible if you are a pokemon go (1:56 - 2:01)

dot next to your name we would have (2:40 - 2:42)
invited you (2:41 - 2:45)
alex gets points alex yes catherine gets (2:42 - 2:47)
catherine gets points but there were a (2:45 - 2:48)
few others that did (2:47 - 2:52)
answer the qual but there were we (2:48 - 2:54)
failed a mega loaf honey because none of (2:52 - 2:56)
y'all showed up yes i would have done (2:54 - 2:56)
mega lopan (2:56 - 3:00)
well you weren't there (2:56 - 3:00)
we can't rely on you you sleep all the (3:00 - 3:04)
time do you know what the (3:02 - 3:05)
better tell is whether they're going to (3:04 - 3:07)
join your right or not (3:05 - 3:10)
what it's when they have the mega symbol (3:07 - 3:13)
next their name as well as the green dot (3:10 - 3:15)
alex did have the mega symbol next to (3:13 - 3:18)
his name the mega symbol is the ultimate (3:15 - 3:18)
like (3:18 - 3:21)
they are ready to jump because they got (3:18 - 3:23)
that uh hopefully they got that like (3:21 - 3:25)
next to them nobody has the mega hound (3:23 - 3:26)
going (3:25 - 3:28)
credit to actual shooby i can't remember (3:26 - 3:30)
actual shoe b's real name but actual (3:28 - 3:31)
shoe b showed up (3:30 - 3:34)
yeah for one congrats thank you (3:31 - 3:36)
we'll actually start off the show with (3:34 - 3:37)
something helpful i don't know if people (3:36 - 3:38)
know this or not (3:37 - 3:40)
something helpful show up for my daggone (3:38 - 3:42)
raids when i invite you (3:40 - 3:44)
otherwise i will put you on the list the (3:42 - 3:46)
bad list you will go further down you (3:44 - 3:47)
will (3:46 - 3:49)
probably removed from my list of pokemon (3:47 - 3:50)
go friends i (3:49 - 3:52)
have plenty of people who want to be my (3:50 - 3:54)
pokemon go friends who would be willing (3:52 - 3:56)
to show up for raids when i invite them (3:54 - 4:00)
thank you so i i (3:56 - 4:02)
think a lot of people were not a lot (4:00 - 4:04)
maybe many people maybe many vocal (4:02 - 4:05)
people (4:04 - 4:07)
were a little bit bummed that suabloo (4:05 - 4:09)
was not double candy (4:07 - 4:10)
and double candy would have made sense (4:09 - 4:12)
for suavelu since it cost (4:10 - 4:16)
400 to evolve swat blue into altaria (4:12 - 4:20)
and instead they did the double (4:16 - 4:23)
hatch distance this time around which i (4:20 - 4:24)
don't know maybe it was due for it i (4:23 - 4:26)
can't remember if there's like a pattern (4:24 - 4:27)
to like (4:26 - 4:30)
stardust xp hatch candy they've taught (4:27 - 4:31)
me not to (4:30 - 4:33)
not to look for patterns yeah maybe (4:31 - 4:35)
there's me so many times (4:33 - 4:40)
but um on these on these days where (4:35 - 4:41)
ideally you're supposed to play a lot of (4:40 - 4:44)
pokemon go because they're like a (4:41 - 4:47)
six-hour community day go have fun (4:44 - 4:50)
trainers here are your bonuses (4:47 - 4:52)
uh i don't know if people know this but (4:50 - 4:54)
when you mega evolve a pokemon (4:52 - 4:57)
if you mega evolve the pokemon of the (4:54 - 4:58)
type you're catching so in this case (4:57 - 5:01)
this weekend i mega evolved pidgeot (4:58 - 5:03)
because believe it or not swablu is not (5:01 - 5:05)
a dragon type it's a flying type (5:03 - 5:09)
um you get normal yeah you get like (5:05 - 5:12)
bonus energy slash whatever matching the (5:09 - 5:13)
type (5:12 - 5:16)
so if it was like squirtle you would (5:13 - 5:18)
want a mega evolved water pokemon if it (5:16 - 5:19)
was like charmander you want a mega (5:18 - 5:20)
evolve (5:19 - 5:22)
a hound doom or a charizard and i get (5:20 - 5:24)
bonus whats yeah (5:22 - 5:26)
bonus energy what are you talking about (5:24 - 5:28)
what is energy there's no energy in (5:26 - 5:29)
pokemon so like (5:28 - 5:32)
that's the tcg (5:29 - 5:32)
so you know how you need omega energy to (5:32 - 5:36)
mega evolve (5:35 - 5:40)
yes yes so for pidgeot you need (5:36 - 5:43)
once i think i think you need only a (5:40 - 5:45)
hundred mega energy to evolve it and (5:43 - 5:47)
then after you mega evolve it again it's (5:45 - 5:49)
only 20. (5:47 - 5:52)
so when you mega evolve it and then (5:49 - 5:52)
every (5:52 - 5:55)
flying type or normal type you catch you (5:52 - 5:55)
get (5:55 - 6:00)
mega energy back oh like a little refund (5:55 - 6:04)
so you have a cashback credit card (6:00 - 6:06)
you know so if you do one percent of the (6:04 - 6:07)
gas station (6:06 - 6:09)
two percent for flying three percent for (6:07 - 6:10)
normals makes sense (6:09 - 6:12)
like my chase points yeah yeah where i (6:10 - 6:13)
get all the points (6:12 - 6:16)
so you get um so by the time you catch (6:13 - 6:18)
20 swablu (6:16 - 6:23)
you're you've paid for your mega (6:18 - 6:23)
or you could not mega and not (6:23 - 6:29)
pay and keep the money in the bank yes (6:27 - 6:31)
there you go (6:29 - 6:34)
if you if you catch 40 suavelu you (6:31 - 6:36)
double your energy you (6:34 - 6:38)
you've made it nobody is catching 40 (6:36 - 6:39)
swablu (6:38 - 6:42)
but wait here let's also repeat a (6:39 - 6:43)
conversation between will (6:42 - 6:47)
and greg yesterday yes hey greg (6:43 - 6:50)
yes i guess i have to evolve one of (6:47 - 6:51)
these uh (6:50 - 6:54)
shiny golden swab blues into an alteria (6:51 - 6:57)
so i could have a shiny alteria (6:54 - 6:59)
yes and will then evolves a shiny golden (6:57 - 7:01)
swablu into a golden alteria (6:59 - 7:04)
and i say oh look there's a button that (7:01 - 7:06)
says mega evolve the alteria but it (7:04 - 7:07)
needs (7:06 - 7:11)
200 mega alteria (7:07 - 7:15)
whatevers triangles where do i get those (7:11 - 7:18)
it's not released yet no it was released (7:15 - 7:19)
it was released at the end of the radar (7:18 - 7:20)
okay you know (7:19 - 7:22)
i was working on the radar when the (7:20 - 7:24)
radar was over i lost interest (7:22 - 7:26)
then when the radar was over oh i'm (7:24 - 7:27)
sorry it's not right hour it was (7:26 - 7:28)
released at the end of the community day (7:27 - 7:32)
yeah the sensible one to three the two (7:28 - 7:34)
hours in the middle of the day we walked (7:32 - 7:36)
around the art park it was very lovely (7:34 - 7:37)
we had wonderful conversations there was (7:36 - 7:38)
friends (7:37 - 7:40)
everybody except catherine alex and (7:38 - 7:41)
other people that showed up for our (7:40 - 7:43)
raids (7:41 - 7:46)
i especially did i (7:43 - 7:49)
did god he got just raped so i wanted to (7:46 - 7:51)
do the megas (7:49 - 7:53)
so instead of doing an early community (7:51 - 7:55)
like you guys i did it near the end (7:53 - 8:00)
how is it one o'clock in the afternoon (7:55 - 8:00)
and drove the half hour up to greg's (8:05 - 8:12)
neighborhood that's you know there (8:09 - 8:15)
i went shopping i bought uh new pieces (8:12 - 8:18)
of furniture i bought a lamp i had lunch (8:15 - 8:21)
i met will at one this was my morning i (8:18 - 8:22)
didn't want to grasp (8:21 - 8:25)
twice i like to i like to sleep so my (8:22 - 8:26)
thought process was (8:25 - 8:28)
do it from three to five that's two (8:26 - 8:30)
hours and then at five the altaria (8:28 - 8:32)
starts popping and then i'm already out (8:30 - 8:34)
and i'm out and about (8:32 - 8:38)
uh turns knife delete at six turns out (8:34 - 8:41)
no this has been however many community (8:38 - 8:41)
days (8:41 - 8:44)
in a row that i've gone back to the park (8:41 - 8:48)
the park i used to go to pre-pandemic (8:44 - 8:51)
and this is like three or four and no (8:48 - 8:52)
one is out playing (8:51 - 8:55)
after like three it's like yeah people (8:52 - 8:56)
have lives (8:55 - 8:58)
yeah they don't want to play the whole (8:56 - 8:59)
six hours no (8:58 - 9:01)
um and or they just don't want to go to (8:59 - 9:03)
that park anymore i guess which i find (9:01 - 9:05)
hard to believe because that park is (9:03 - 9:07)
extremely popular that's why i go there (9:05 - 9:09)
you should have cut you should a live (9:07 - 9:11)
here b go to the air park with us there (9:09 - 9:12)
was (9:11 - 9:14)
plenty of people playing i i'm working (9:12 - 9:15)
on that (9:14 - 9:16)
so there's two ways there was two ways (9:15 - 9:19)
to get mega altar of candy this (9:16 - 9:21)
yesterday one was to do mega altaria (9:19 - 9:22)
raids (9:21 - 9:25)
the other was that some of the research (9:22 - 9:29)
the spin the pokestop stuff uh (9:25 - 9:33)
they had what do whatever to get candy (9:29 - 9:35)
that was the first time they did that (9:33 - 9:37)
and it seems like people were very (9:35 - 9:38)
excited about that like that (9:37 - 9:41)
um i didn't find a lot of those quests i (9:38 - 9:43)
mostly had like catch three and get like (9:41 - 9:45)
three ultra balls (9:43 - 9:47)
i didn't even pay attention i was so (9:45 - 9:50)
having a good time with my friend will (9:47 - 9:53)
greg and greg won community day i did (9:50 - 9:55)
because greg got the most shiny swab (9:53 - 9:56)
blues i like (9:55 - 10:00)
at one point only had one (9:56 - 10:05)
but back to the main topic here (10:00 - 10:09)
having having an altaria day (10:05 - 10:12)
where you have a pokemon that can mega (10:09 - 10:12)
evolve (10:12 - 10:14)
but you can't mega evolve it until the (10:12 - 10:16)
community day is over (10:14 - 10:17)
that's like getting a present on (10:16 - 10:19)
christmas and then (10:17 - 10:21)
the that says well but you can't (10:19 - 10:23)
actually play this until new year's day (10:21 - 10:24)
the batteries aren't released in time i (10:23 - 10:25)
was like please yeah just like don't (10:24 - 10:27)
even give me the the present okay (10:25 - 10:31)
because now i just hate you get it (10:27 - 10:35)
uh again it's it's it's like (10:31 - 10:40)
niantic hates money (10:35 - 10:41)
like but they don't they love money they (10:40 - 10:43)
don't they make a lot of it they (10:41 - 10:46)
love money but what what if you just (10:43 - 10:48)
do the raids during the raid hour why (10:46 - 10:50)
don't you boost (10:48 - 10:52)
the raids during they they have a button (10:50 - 10:54)
why didn't they just have the (10:52 - 10:57)
greg and i did raids with the occasional (10:54 - 10:57)
good (10:57 - 11:00)
people who showed up to do them with us (10:57 - 11:02)
yeah now steve (11:00 - 11:04)
sometimes they hit the wrong button and (11:02 - 11:05)
they turn off shinies or (11:04 - 11:09)
they turn off of paris and then whatever (11:05 - 11:12)
why don't they that says like (11:09 - 11:14)
triple the amount of rate this is not (11:12 - 11:16)
specific to altaria this is specific to (11:14 - 11:17)
every (11:16 - 11:20)
community today and i feel (11:17 - 11:22)
for those players who don't live in a (11:20 - 11:24)
big city (11:22 - 11:25)
i feel for those players who don't play (11:24 - 11:27)
every single day i feel for those (11:25 - 11:30)
players i respect those players let me (11:27 - 11:31)
change that word i respect those players (11:30 - 11:33)
that are not in a discord or in a (11:31 - 11:35)
facebook group because those people are (11:33 - 11:36)
out of their minds (11:35 - 11:37)
and they're they're doing the right (11:36 - 11:39)
trains and i don't want (11:37 - 11:42)
800 pings about how a low punny popped (11:39 - 11:45)
some of these people they they play (11:42 - 11:46)
pokemon go (11:45 - 11:48)
heavily but they only play once a week (11:46 - 11:50)
and usually maybe that's a saturday (11:48 - 11:53)
maybe that's a community why does (11:50 - 11:54)
niantic just not (11:53 - 11:57)
boost the raids for community today (11:54 - 11:57)
there (11:57 - 12:00)
we you are telling all your players to (11:57 - 12:02)

before like there has been community (12:43 - 12:45)
days (12:44 - 12:48)
um where i did the whole three hours at (12:45 - 12:50)
elm grove park (12:48 - 12:52)
and the entire three hours this is (12:50 - 12:54)
before pandemic (12:52 - 12:56)
um there was only like two raids the (12:54 - 12:57)
entire three hours and there's like (12:56 - 12:59)
eight gyms at this park and that's (12:57 - 13:02)
that is frustrating of like i see all (12:59 - 13:03)
these people playing (13:02 - 13:05)
they're all incense they got the lures (13:03 - 13:07)
down everyone's having a good time you (13:05 - 13:07)
got (13:07 - 13:09)
little johnny across the sidewalk (13:07 - 13:13)
yelling that he got a shiny something (13:09 - 13:16)
and it's like it's so it would be so (13:13 - 13:17)
easy to jump in our raids (13:16 - 13:20)
uh you know what they did right kanto (13:17 - 13:21)
the kanto fest (13:20 - 13:24)
there was raid after raid after raid (13:21 - 13:28)
and it was sweet um and i kind of wish (13:24 - 13:30)
community days felt a little more like (13:28 - 13:32)
that (13:30 - 13:34)
i have to pay 12.99 for that experience (13:32 - 13:36)
though (13:34 - 13:36)
if they said hey for 12.99 you'll always (13:37 - 13:41)

uh marlowe is really cute (14:35 - 14:40)
hey i got some good snaps of the more (14:41 - 14:45)
lulls (14:44 - 14:48)
and who else did i get (14:45 - 14:52)
it was like night time in the jungle (14:48 - 14:52)
my part light part is daytime light (14:52 - 14:57)
parts done we're diamond diamond diamond (14:54 - 14:58)
on life (14:57 - 15:02)
there's nothing new to learn there uh (14:58 - 15:05)
i got ya is it yanma or yon mega that is (15:02 - 15:07)
don megan (15:05 - 15:10)
i got it to look right at me it was it (15:07 - 15:11)
picked up an apple that had been (15:10 - 15:13)
floating in the water and was just (15:11 - 15:14)
chewing on it so (15:13 - 15:17)
nice and sweetly got that i'm still just (15:14 - 15:18)
i'm still having a good time but i'm (15:17 - 15:19)
also (15:18 - 15:21)
still playing each level about 30 times (15:19 - 15:24)
before i will move on to a new level (15:21 - 15:27)
uh did you make it past jungle (15:24 - 15:30)
no no (15:27 - 15:30)
all right you know you're getting your (15:31 - 15:34)
money's worth why why would i go past (15:33 - 15:36)
jungle when i still haven't finished (15:34 - 15:38)
park (15:36 - 15:40)
i still haven't finished meganium i (15:38 - 15:41)
still gotta do meganium like (15:40 - 15:44)
15 more times okay so meganium is what i (15:41 - 15:45)
want to talk about (15:44 - 15:48)
uh i i want to be as i don't want to (15:45 - 15:51)
spoil some stuff but i am going to talk (15:48 - 15:52)
very specific about the meganium thing (15:51 - 15:54)
because there's a lot there that they (15:52 - 15:54)
don't (15:54 - 15:58)
show you on the surface um but but i (15:54 - 16:00)
have a complaint with the meganium stuff (15:58 - 16:02)
uh but before i get to the meganium (16:00 - 16:03)
stuff i want to talk about (16:02 - 16:07)
how pokemon snap is is really good at (16:03 - 16:08)
discovery we've talked about this (16:07 - 16:12)
prior but it's it's so good at it um and (16:08 - 16:13)
which is why the meganium stuff is (16:12 - 16:14)
frustrating (16:13 - 16:18)
so um again i'm not going to be spoiler (16:14 - 16:19)
here (16:18 - 16:22)
so there's there's a level where the the (16:19 - 16:23)
first pokemon snap did this let me lay (16:22 - 16:25)
the groundwork the first pokemon snap (16:23 - 16:28)
in the beach level there's there's a (16:25 - 16:29)
there's a lapras (16:28 - 16:31)
so you got you got your dodrio pops out (16:29 - 16:33)
your pidgeys pop out there's a pikachu (16:31 - 16:33)
you can (16:33 - 16:35)
kite him over to the surfboard he gets (16:33 - 16:37)
on the surfboard he starts dancing (16:35 - 16:39)
but if if you look in the background in (16:37 - 16:41)
the ocean there's a lapras and if you (16:39 - 16:43)
take a picture of the lapras (16:41 - 16:45)
um when you get to the scyther part (16:43 - 16:47)
which is right past the snorlax (16:45 - 16:51)
uh more laprases will appear it tr (16:47 - 16:53)
that picture of lapras triggers more (16:51 - 16:55)
lapras so when you get to (16:53 - 16:56)
past the snorlax you get more lapras if (16:55 - 16:58)
you take a picture of those when you (16:56 - 16:59)
cross the bridge (16:58 - 17:01)
you get another if you look back to the (16:59 - 17:02)
ocean you get another lapras you take a (17:01 - 17:04)
picture of that and then finally right (17:02 - 17:05)
before you get to kangaskhan (17:04 - 17:07)
you can get some incredible pictures of (17:05 - 17:08)
lapras because it comes (17:07 - 17:11)
really close to the bridge and the only (17:08 - 17:13)
way you do that is by taking pictures of (17:11 - 17:14)
lapras (17:13 - 17:16)
um and i think there's like one or two (17:14 - 17:17)
other instances in (17:16 - 17:20)
the 64 version where it does that they (17:17 - 17:22)
brought that mechanic back (17:20 - 17:25)
um and so uh but they don't use it (17:22 - 17:29)
a lot over with (17:25 - 17:30)
the whole scope of the game it's not (17:29 - 17:32)
used a lot (17:30 - 17:34)
but in one level there's a pokemon on (17:32 - 17:35)
top of a hill (17:34 - 17:38)
and if you take a picture of it it will (17:35 - 17:39)
then appear (17:38 - 17:40)
at a different hill and if you take a (17:39 - 17:42)
picture of it it will appear in front of (17:40 - 17:43)
you and if you take a picture of it it (17:42 - 17:45)
will open a secret path (17:43 - 17:46)
and the first time you open that secret (17:45 - 17:48)
path you're like holy cow that was (17:46 - 17:49)
awesome (17:48 - 17:52)
and the game is really the game doesn't (17:49 - 17:54)
tell you that like nowhere in the (17:52 - 17:55)
instruction manual the game is like well (17:54 - 17:58)
if y'all take a picture of the pokemon (17:55 - 18:00)
instruction manual there's no (17:58 - 18:01)
instruction manual (18:00 - 18:05)
there never has been and and i think for (18:01 - 18:06)
that i think (18:05 - 18:09)
most players will eventually have that (18:06 - 18:11)
happen without looking it up because (18:09 - 18:13)
eventually you'll probably be like (18:11 - 18:15)
i need a picture of that pokemon right (18:13 - 18:16)
eventually (18:15 - 18:18)
you're probably going to be like i want (18:16 - 18:20)
a better picture of that pokemon and if (18:18 - 18:20)
you if you're (18:20 - 18:22)
if you're setting out on your level to (18:20 - 18:24)
take a picture of that pokemon (18:22 - 18:27)
and you do it and then um it's not even (18:24 - 18:28)
like a six seven (18:27 - 18:30)
it's it's less than five seconds later (18:28 - 18:31)
they appear again you do it (18:30 - 18:33)
and then maybe three to four seconds (18:31 - 18:34)
later they appear again and you do it (18:33 - 18:36)
and then they open the secret path (18:34 - 18:38)
and then that secret path is permanently (18:36 - 18:39)
opened so (18:38 - 18:43)
the game is incredible at doing that and (18:39 - 18:45)
when you first go through that secret (18:43 - 18:46)
path you're like whoa (18:45 - 18:48)
i didn't know like this was here and (18:46 - 18:49)
there's new pokemon that you've never (18:48 - 18:51)
seen on that secret path (18:49 - 18:54)
and then another example is in a (18:51 - 18:55)
different level there's a (18:54 - 19:00)
there's a pokemon that is on a rock (18:55 - 19:02)
and it's one of the pokemon where if you (19:00 - 19:04)
hit him with an apple (19:02 - 19:07)
he falls off the rock and then something (19:04 - 19:11)
exciting super happens and (19:07 - 19:13)
you have no reason to throw an apple at (19:11 - 19:14)
this pokemon because (19:13 - 19:16)
it's a pokemon that appears in a bunch (19:14 - 19:17)
of other levels you probably (19:16 - 19:20)
already have good shots of that pokemon (19:17 - 19:21)
but when you (19:20 - 19:24)
knock them off the rock something really (19:21 - 19:25)
really cool happens (19:24 - 19:28)
and it's it's it blows your mind you're (19:25 - 19:30)
like this might be the coolest picture (19:28 - 19:33)
i've ever had um well if you respond (19:30 - 19:34)
fast enough to take a picture (19:33 - 19:37)
will anderson's biggest problem well the (19:34 - 19:38)
nice part about that one is it's at the (19:37 - 19:39)
start of the level (19:38 - 19:43)
uh so but this is something that you (19:39 - 19:43)
would (19:43 - 19:46)
probably eventually do because of all (19:43 - 19:47)
your tools (19:46 - 19:49)
hey have i tried the music on this (19:47 - 19:50)
pokemon have i tried an apple on this (19:49 - 19:52)
pokemon have i tried (19:50 - 19:54)
the illuminati ball have i tried the (19:52 - 19:55)
scan (19:54 - 19:57)
right you have four different items you (19:55 - 19:59)
can use and so the game (19:57 - 20:01)
does those two interactions are both (19:59 - 20:03)
done perfectly throughout the game (20:01 - 20:06)
you'll eventually discover them if (20:03 - 20:06)
you're trying (20:06 - 20:08)
to unlock the secrets yourself obviously (20:06 - 20:10)
you could skip everything i said (20:08 - 20:12)
just go directly to therapy look up (20:10 - 20:13)
every interaction and then move on with (20:12 - 20:14)
life (20:13 - 20:18)
but the but pokemon snap is very good at (20:14 - 20:20)
at kind of encouraging you to use all (20:18 - 20:22)
your tools (20:20 - 20:25)
and then we get to the meganium level (20:22 - 20:26)
and well it's not i know what you're (20:25 - 20:28)
talking about and i have a different (20:26 - 20:29)
level that i have this i had the same (20:28 - 20:31)
problem in (20:29 - 20:34)
and the the meganium level (20:31 - 20:36)
is relatively short it's way shorter (20:34 - 20:38)
than everything else (20:36 - 20:40)
meganium starts off in a different pose (20:38 - 20:42)
every time he has like three poses one (20:40 - 20:42)
he's lying down (20:42 - 20:45)
to the eevee's jumping on him hey don't (20:42 - 20:46)
that's a spoiler (20:45 - 20:49)
you're not supposed (20:46 - 20:49)
stop now uh so (20:52 - 20:59)
um if you start off that level (20:55 - 21:03)
and you do the scan you see meganium (20:59 - 21:05)
you you so you scan the area you see (21:03 - 21:07)
meganium you see eevee and then you see (21:05 - 21:08)
a sylveon (21:07 - 21:09)
off to the side and you can scan right (21:08 - 21:11)
away so right off the bat of the (21:09 - 21:12)
mechanium level you got (21:11 - 21:16)
meganium sylveon eevee and (21:12 - 21:18)
you gotta throw the illuminati ball (21:16 - 21:20)
meganium gets all powered up (21:18 - 21:23)
and then when meganium gets to the first (21:20 - 21:26)
uh crystal when you throw the (21:23 - 21:28)
illuminati ball you can get like a four (21:26 - 21:30)
star picture of sylveon and a four-star (21:28 - 21:31)
picture of evie because they're really (21:30 - 21:32)
excited (21:31 - 21:33)
and you can get some good shots of (21:32 - 21:36)
meganium so if if you do that first part (21:33 - 21:38)
all right (21:36 - 21:40)
if you get the silvion to come over if (21:38 - 21:41)
you get the eevee to follow if you get (21:40 - 21:43)
meganium to smell the crystal (21:41 - 21:47)
then shaymin will appear on the rock (21:43 - 21:49)
and they give you a very short window (21:47 - 21:50)
and they purposely put these trees in (21:49 - 21:51)
the way (21:50 - 21:53)
where you you have a short window of (21:51 - 21:55)
hitting shaman with illuminati ball (21:53 - 21:57)
and if you hit him with the illuminati (21:55 - 21:59)
ball he uh meganium will look over (21:57 - 22:02)
shaymin will jump on meganium's head and (21:59 - 22:03)
then (22:02 - 22:07)
he'll keep going and then that seems (22:03 - 22:09)
to be and when you do that sorry right (22:07 - 22:11)
before shaymin (22:09 - 22:13)
to comfay will come out of the tree uh (22:11 - 22:15)
to like signify that (22:13 - 22:17)
shaymin is active so you did the first (22:15 - 22:18)
part with evie (22:17 - 22:20)
sylveon meganium comfey comes out of the (22:18 - 22:22)
tree meaning you did it right (22:20 - 22:23)
shaymin appears you hit shaymin with the (22:22 - 22:25)
illuminati you got five pokemon (22:23 - 22:28)
and then um there's another crystal and (22:25 - 22:29)
if you hit that (22:28 - 22:32)
correctly meganium will run around the (22:29 - 22:34)
tree and then the level is over (22:32 - 22:37)
and that's the whole level and you have (22:34 - 22:37)
these (22:37 - 22:40)
tools so there are four more pokemon in (22:37 - 22:41)
this level (22:40 - 22:43)
which is the frustrating part because (22:41 - 22:45)
you have these tools (22:43 - 22:49)
and none of them work like the entire (22:45 - 22:51)
rest of the game works and it's (22:49 - 22:53)
incredibly frustrating (22:51 - 22:56)
more specifically the scan tool so (22:53 - 23:00)
um i i'm 56 hours in (22:56 - 23:02)
this was the first time i had to look it (23:00 - 23:03)
up because i was so frustrated with (23:02 - 23:05)
doing this level over and over and (23:03 - 23:06)
there's two right (23:05 - 23:07)
there there's two reasons i knew there (23:06 - 23:08)
was more pokemon on this level number (23:07 - 23:10)
one is professor mir says like (23:08 - 23:13)
oh you can get meganium to sit down. he (23:10 - 23:15)
wants a picture of meganium sitting on (23:13 - 23:15)
his butt (23:15 - 23:17)
he's like okay well i've done this level (23:15 - 23:18)
30 times meganium's not sitting on his (23:17 - 23:20)
butt so i don't know what i'm supposed (23:18 - 23:21)
to do here (23:20 - 23:25)
and then number two is um (23:21 - 23:25)
i lost my thought for number two uh (23:26 - 23:33)
but oh number two is the leaderboard (23:29 - 23:35)
i had a score of eight hundred 000 for (23:33 - 23:36)
that level (23:35 - 23:39)
and somebody else had 1.8 million on (23:36 - 23:40)
that level (23:39 - 23:42)
and i was like how the heck did they get (23:40 - 23:45)
1.8 million because i'm getting (23:42 - 23:48)
four diamonds (23:45 - 23:50)
four star diamonds on evie and shaymin (23:48 - 23:52)
and meganium (23:50 - 23:54)
how did they get so many points unless (23:52 - 23:56)
there's more pokemon in this level (23:54 - 23:59)
and so there are there are two pokemon (23:56 - 24:01)
hidden in that giant tree that meganium (23:59 - 24:02)
runs around (24:01 - 24:05)
and the scan feature the thing that is (24:02 - 24:06)
supposed to (24:05 - 24:09)
show you where pokemon are doesn't work (24:06 - 24:10)
on the tree (24:09 - 24:12)
and before anyone says well maybe the (24:10 - 24:14)
tree is too far (24:12 - 24:19)
sylveon is a yeah across the world (24:14 - 24:22)
feature works and shows you sylveon and (24:19 - 24:24)
so the scan feature doesn't show you (24:22 - 24:26)
there are pokemon in the tree (24:24 - 24:29)
and this then piggybacks off how bad the (24:26 - 24:30)
apple (24:29 - 24:34)
physics are so you ha and again the game (24:30 - 24:35)
doesn't tell you (24:34 - 24:37)
ever you need to do this nor i don't (24:35 - 24:38)
think there's another level where this (24:37 - 24:39)
happens and unless maybe they're (24:38 - 24:41)
specific to boss levels (24:39 - 24:44)
you have to lob apple after apple at the (24:41 - 24:45)
tree (24:44 - 24:46)
and then a bunch of comb bee will come (24:45 - 24:48)
out of the tree and then a hoot hoot (24:46 - 24:50)
will come out of the tree (24:48 - 24:52)
but because the apple physics are kind (24:50 - 24:53)
of bad (24:52 - 24:56)
you literally have to crank your camera (24:53 - 25:00)
as high as possible so you can't even (24:56 - 25:02)
see meganium you can't see the tree (25:00 - 25:03)
you're just (25:02 - 25:05)
throwing apples and hoping you hit the (25:03 - 25:07)
tree and then (25:05 - 25:11)
the combi come out and then (25:07 - 25:15)
the hoot hoot comes out but (25:11 - 25:16)
one your scan doesn't show you their (25:15 - 25:19)
pokemon in the tree two (25:16 - 25:21)
i can't think of anywhere else in the (25:19 - 25:22)
game where you're just randomly throwing (25:21 - 25:23)
apples (25:22 - 25:26)
at a non-pokemon for something to happen (25:23 - 25:28)
without the scan telling you something (25:26 - 25:30)
to happen (25:28 - 25:33)
and three even if you get the combi out (25:30 - 25:34)
of the tree but you (25:33 - 25:37)
fail to get them out fast enough (25:34 - 25:41)
the meganium will not sit down and so (25:37 - 25:42)
you miss that whole moment (25:41 - 25:44)
so even though you might look it up of (25:42 - 25:47)
like oh combi and hoot are in the tree (25:44 - 25:50)
i was only able to get meganium to sit (25:47 - 25:50)
down (25:50 - 25:53)
twice after doing this like 20 (25:50 - 25:57)
times and knowing that combi and hoot (25:53 - 25:58)
hoot are in the tree (25:57 - 26:01)
it's incredibly frustrating (25:58 - 26:04)
um and then on top of that after i did (26:01 - 26:05)
that level i did this level (26:04 - 26:09)
two hours straight to try to just get a (26:05 - 26:10)
high score (26:09 - 26:12)
there are two more pokemon in the level (26:10 - 26:14)
there's a pichu (26:12 - 26:17)
and an apom in this level and there is (26:14 - 26:20)
no way of knowing they're in the level (26:17 - 26:20)
without (26:20 - 26:22)
just knowing you're supposed to randomly (26:20 - 26:25)
throw apples at this part of the cliff (26:22 - 26:27)
because your scan doesn't tell you (26:25 - 26:30)
pokemon are in this level (26:27 - 26:33)
what why is this level built so poorly (26:30 - 26:36)
yeah no no no no no (26:33 - 26:40)
no no no no number one (26:36 - 26:43)
steve the tree is made out of either (26:40 - 26:46)
adamantium or vibranium the scan can't (26:43 - 26:47)
get into the wood (26:46 - 26:48)
that's that's why you can't see the (26:47 - 26:50)
point (26:48 - 26:54)
number two clearly (26:50 - 26:58)
you were born in the late 80s (26:54 - 27:00)
because literally what you just (26:58 - 27:02)
described (27:00 - 27:06)
was all video games from like 1972 (27:02 - 27:07)
1972-1990 (27:06 - 27:11)
no explanation figure it out hope your (27:07 - 27:13)
friends figure it out so they can tell (27:11 - 27:13)
you (27:13 - 27:15)
how to do it there is a game out there (27:13 - 27:17)
called jump man which was literally just (27:15 - 27:17)
like (27:17 - 27:20)
platforms and rings and so there were (27:17 - 27:21)
levels where it's just like (27:20 - 27:24)
how the frick am i supposed to get and (27:21 - 27:25)
then like it was bad (27:24 - 27:28)
bad days peter in the you know recess (27:25 - 27:29)
coming he's like i finally beat that (27:28 - 27:31)
level here's what you got to do you got (27:29 - 27:32)
to actually jump off the screen to the (27:31 - 27:34)
left and you actually reappear (27:32 - 27:35)
not on the normal right where you (27:34 - 27:37)
normally would but you drop down from (27:35 - 27:38)
the top (27:37 - 27:39)
and that's how you do it and number (27:38 - 27:40)
three it's not frustrating it's (27:39 - 27:42)
challenging (27:40 - 27:46)
it's the challenge this is the secret of (27:42 - 27:48)
of the new pokemon snap that you you (27:46 - 27:50)
just like are completely missing (27:48 - 27:53)
it is an homage to classic (27:50 - 27:56)
classic frustration classic video games (27:53 - 27:58)
this is (27:56 - 28:00)
battletoads2021 is what this is (27:58 - 28:04)
i had a very similar experience (28:00 - 28:07)
uh and this is my spoiler warning (28:04 - 28:10)
i had a very similar experience trying (28:07 - 28:11)
to do the mini r (28:10 - 28:16)
section of the desert night (28:11 - 28:18)
but the scan feature works on all the (28:16 - 28:20)
linear no (28:18 - 28:23)
it doesn't because there's there's (28:20 - 28:27)
one that happens (28:23 - 28:30)
immediately and the scan doesn't pick it (28:27 - 28:31)
up until you're (28:30 - 28:34)
well past it i have i until i looked it (28:31 - 28:34)
up (28:34 - 28:37)
i scanned and scanned and it shows one's (28:34 - 28:38)
off in the distance (28:37 - 28:41)
but there's one immediately at the start (28:38 - 28:43)
and it does not show up until you're (28:41 - 28:45)
away from it a distance from it (28:43 - 28:49)
and it's behind you i spent three hours (28:45 - 28:51)
i wonder if the scan is broken on that (28:49 - 28:52)
level (28:51 - 28:54)
now because there's a lot of adamantium (28:52 - 28:56)
and vibranium around it just like (28:54 - 28:58)
it bounces that's why i wanted that's (28:56 - 28:59)
why i want to start off with the two (28:58 - 29:01)
examples of how pokemon snap is really (28:59 - 29:02)
great (29:01 - 29:05)
like the the picture picture pic picture (29:02 - 29:07)
picture picture open secret path (29:05 - 29:10)
and uh try reminder just to try an apple (29:07 - 29:12)
on every pokemon a reminder to try (29:10 - 29:14)
music on every pokemon a reminder to try (29:12 - 29:16)
the scan on every pokemon (29:14 - 29:17)
it gives you reasons to go back to their (29:16 - 29:19)
levels and like hey i don't think i've (29:17 - 29:21)
ever played music in front of this (29:19 - 29:22)
pokemon hey i don't think i've ever (29:21 - 29:24)
thrown an apple on this pokemon's head (29:22 - 29:26)
like it gives you so many reasons to go (29:24 - 29:27)
back (29:26 - 29:30)
and the fact that like those (29:27 - 29:33)
tools don't seem to work like they (29:30 - 29:34)
normally work in the meganium level (29:33 - 29:38)
is incredibly frustrating i believe and (29:34 - 29:41)
even when you know the answer (29:38 - 29:45)
um it's you have such a short window (29:41 - 29:48)
to complete what you want to do and i (29:45 - 29:49)
think (29:48 - 29:51)
the mechanium level maybe gets a small (29:49 - 29:53)
pass because it's a shorter level (29:51 - 29:56)
but imagine like one of the longer (29:53 - 29:58)
levels like the ice level or the (29:56 - 30:00)
um the volcano level and all you're (29:58 - 30:02)
trying to do is get something at the (30:00 - 30:03)
very end of that level (30:02 - 30:05)
and you're like i gotta suffer through (30:03 - 30:07)
the first like two minutes of this level (30:05 - 30:08)
just because i want one (30:07 - 30:11)
good shot at the end (30:08 - 30:11)
the the windows for activation sometimes (30:12 - 30:16)
just seem (30:15 - 30:20)
so incredibly small that i (30:16 - 30:22)
feel like that is more of a hindrance (30:20 - 30:24)
than a benefit (30:22 - 30:26)
and i wish there was a stopping function (30:24 - 30:28)
let me stop (30:26 - 30:31)
yeah and i think like see you're asking (30:28 - 30:33)
them to make the game easier for you no (30:31 - 30:36)
no i just yeah that that (30:33 - 30:39)
meganium level is just bad (30:36 - 30:42)
and it it would it pushes more people (30:39 - 30:44)
away than it brings people (30:42 - 30:46)
that it continues letting people play (30:44 - 30:48)
because most people out there do the (30:46 - 30:50)
mechanium level and they do it enough (30:48 - 30:51)
times to get to the end of the game and (30:50 - 30:52)
they're like (30:51 - 30:54)
that's as much as that as you're right (30:52 - 30:56)
you're right i i am sure that most (30:54 - 30:56)
people (30:56 - 30:58)
probably only did the meganium level (30:56 - 31:00)
maybe three or four (30:58 - 31:02)
what say even more right how this is an (31:00 - 31:04)
homage to classic video games because (31:02 - 31:06)
they would always put (31:04 - 31:08)
like the most complicated one up at the (31:06 - 31:09)
front and you'd get past (31:08 - 31:11)
it and then you'd be like oh wait but i (31:09 - 31:12)
missed this and then you'd like (31:11 - 31:14)
find out later oh i missed this other (31:12 - 31:15)
thing you'd keep going back and doing (31:14 - 31:17)
those levels that were just like it (31:15 - 31:19)
seemed so simple at the beginning (31:17 - 31:21)
it's easy to grind out like jungle or (31:19 - 31:24)
park because even if you had a bad run (31:21 - 31:26)
or even if you missed the one picture (31:24 - 31:27)
you wanted to get you probably have (31:26 - 31:29)
other pictures that are better (31:27 - 31:32)
or you probably at least got a pose so (31:29 - 31:33)
like there is there's like (31:32 - 31:36)
ah i almost had it that time these three (31:33 - 31:37)
pictures are better (31:36 - 31:40)
let's run it again um but with the (31:37 - 31:44)
with the meganium one um (31:40 - 31:46)
one you don't need that a palmer that (31:44 - 31:48)
pichu to appear (31:46 - 31:50)
because you probably already have one (31:48 - 31:53)
two three four stars from other levels (31:50 - 31:57)
um and two (31:53 - 31:59)
like the only reason they would really (31:57 - 32:01)
you would really want them to appear (31:59 - 32:03)
is if you wanted like a course high (32:01 - 32:04)
score (32:03 - 32:07)
uh because again you could you could (32:04 - 32:08)
easily get a 4k (32:07 - 32:13)
pichu in um park in like the first level (32:08 - 32:15)
so so they they are hidden for the like (32:13 - 32:16)
the more (32:15 - 32:18)
hardcore but i just like why if the scam (32:16 - 32:21)
can see sylveon 18 miles away (32:18 - 32:23)
why can't the scan at least tell me like (32:21 - 32:24)
it doesn't need to tell me what pokemon (32:23 - 32:25)
are in the tree it doesn't tell me (32:24 - 32:26)
it doesn't need to tell me how many (32:25 - 32:28)
pokemon on the tree but why doesn't it (32:26 - 32:28)
just show like (32:28 - 32:30)
question mark question mark question (32:28 - 32:32)
mark i can be right next to a (32:30 - 32:34)
lady lydian lady in whatever that (32:32 - 32:36)
pokemon is called (32:34 - 32:38)
in the park in the in the jungle at (32:36 - 32:40)
night and i can be right next to it and (32:38 - 32:41)
see it and it'll be like question mark (32:40 - 32:43)
question mark question mark it's like i (32:41 - 32:43)
know what it is (32:43 - 32:45)
i know it's there i know that i need to (32:43 - 32:47)
do something to get it to come out of (32:45 - 32:48)
the tree (32:47 - 32:51)
but the fact that the the scan feature (32:48 - 32:52)
doesn't work (32:51 - 32:54)
like i still don't know exactly where (32:52 - 32:56)
the apom is in that level (32:54 - 32:57)
and i know you're supposed to throw (32:56 - 33:00)
apples to like kite him out (32:57 - 33:02)
but you want me to just go through the (33:00 - 33:03)
level over and over and just (33:02 - 33:07)
throw apples because i promise you (33:03 - 33:10)
you do that the minute that apom pokes (33:07 - 33:11)
its little apom (33:10 - 33:14)
head out you're gonna be yes hooray i (33:11 - 33:15)
fight (33:14 - 33:16)
how do you know i'm not without (33:15 - 33:18)
frustrating because i'm gonna because (33:16 - 33:18)
i'm gonna (33:18 - 33:20)
miss because i'm gonna miss an (33:18 - 33:22)
activation of that i would just like (33:20 - 33:25)
feel my soul just like expands through (33:22 - 33:25)
my body (33:25 - 33:29)
i'm like oh relief (33:25 - 33:31)
i've got the combis and the hoot hoot (33:29 - 33:32)
out of the tree (33:31 - 33:35)
will you know we've met you (33:32 - 33:35)
we know how you are sense of relief my (33:36 - 33:40)
butt (33:39 - 33:44)
excuse me excuse me (33:40 - 33:46)
like in the medium level it's already (33:44 - 33:48)
really tight (33:46 - 33:51)
to go from um getting shaman (33:48 - 33:55)
on meganium's head to getting the hoot (33:51 - 33:56)
hoot and the (33:55 - 33:58)
combi out of the tree do you have to do (33:56 - 33:59)
them all (33:58 - 34:01)
do you have to have shaymin on his head (33:59 - 34:03)
to get the hoot and the combi out of the (34:01 - 34:04)
tree (34:03 - 34:05)
or can you do those as separate (34:04 - 34:07)
activities (34:05 - 34:10)
i believe i don't know the answer to (34:07 - 34:11)
that (34:10 - 34:13)
i'm not going to tell you that's what (34:11 - 34:15)
i'm sure i would assume (34:13 - 34:18)
yes you probably do because um (34:15 - 34:21)
because of how he sits down and i think (34:18 - 34:23)
you need him to sit down because him and (34:21 - 34:24)
shaymin both (34:23 - 34:26)
when he sits him and shaymin both smell (34:24 - 34:28)
the tree that's like the (34:26 - 34:31)
that's the shot that mirrors what a (34:28 - 34:33)
reward for hard work and effort (34:31 - 34:35)
but i've gotten i've gotten all the (34:33 - 34:37)
combi to come out of the tree (34:35 - 34:40)
but not the hoot hoot and then he won't (34:37 - 34:40)
sit (34:40 - 34:42)
unless the hoot hoot and the combi are (34:40 - 34:43)
both out of the tree because they're (34:42 - 34:45)
those are like two separate (34:43 - 34:47)
triggers like combi comes out first and (34:45 - 34:49)
then you gotta go a little bit farther (34:47 - 34:50)
to the right (34:49 - 34:52)
and hope you knock out the hoot hoot in (34:50 - 34:53)
time (34:52 - 34:54)
and if you don't knock it out if you (34:53 - 34:56)
don't knock those pokemon out in time (34:54 - 34:59)
then meganium won't sit down (34:56 - 35:03)
um and so in between in between (34:59 - 35:06)
shaman jumping on his head and (35:03 - 35:09)
the crystal that you have to hit and (35:06 - 35:10)
then (35:09 - 35:11)
after you hit the crystal getting them (35:10 - 35:13)
out of the tree (35:11 - 35:15)
you have to find a palm and pichu in (35:13 - 35:16)
that window (35:15 - 35:18)
and that's less than 10 seconds it just (35:16 - 35:21)
it's just this is (35:18 - 35:24)
get get on get good (35:21 - 35:27)
let's get good and i think that all of (35:24 - 35:29)
that would be (35:27 - 35:31)
better if the scan just did what it (35:29 - 35:33)
needed to do which is like just point (35:31 - 35:35)
out (35:33 - 35:38)
what you should do or try instead of (35:35 - 35:38)
just like (35:38 - 35:40)
randomly lobbing apples at a tree which (35:38 - 35:42)
no other mechanic in the entire game has (35:40 - 35:43)
ever (35:42 - 35:47)
asked you to do because like if you were (35:43 - 35:48)
to throw apples at something (35:47 - 35:51)
i don't know there's some i think in the (35:48 - 35:53)
park at night there's a tree with a hole (35:51 - 35:55)
in it that i keep throwing apples into (35:53 - 35:57)
and i'm pretty sure something's gonna (35:55 - 35:58)
happen some (35:57 - 36:01)
day in jungle there is a tree with a (35:58 - 36:02)
hole in it (36:01 - 36:04)
yes at night and if you scan it it will (36:02 - 36:06)
show you there's a pika peck in it (36:04 - 36:09)
no that's not the hole i'm thinking of (36:06 - 36:11)
it's like right before the tree branch (36:09 - 36:13)
before the two look i (36:11 - 36:15)
haven't done jungle enough i'm still on (36:13 - 36:16)
park because (36:15 - 36:18)
now that you actually were talking about (36:16 - 36:19)
secret pass i (36:18 - 36:22)
unlocked a secret path in park and i (36:19 - 36:23)
haven't (36:22 - 36:25)
taken it yet so now i got gotta go back (36:23 - 36:27)
there and do that one (36:25 - 36:30)
i don't know how i unlocked it it just (36:27 - 36:31)
told me at the end of the road (36:30 - 36:34)
one day i was like oh this secret path (36:31 - 36:35)
has opened up (36:34 - 36:37)
but now that greg said the scan didn't (36:35 - 36:39)
work on that very first menu (36:37 - 36:40)
even though it worked on every other (36:39 - 36:43)
minier i wonder if the scan is (36:40 - 36:46)
like slightly bugged no because why (36:43 - 36:47)
wouldn't it work on that very first menu (36:46 - 36:48)
because you said it eventually worked (36:47 - 36:51)
because it was too close it's (36:48 - 36:53)
i mean it could it doesn't make sense (36:51 - 36:54)
that it's too close because other things (36:53 - 36:56)
that are too close also register (36:54 - 36:59)
i don't know if it's i couldn't tell you (36:56 - 37:03)
i spent three hours and i was like (36:59 - 37:05)
this is never triggering i'm clearly (37:03 - 37:06)
missing one and i have (37:05 - 37:09)
how happy did you feel when you finally (37:06 - 37:10)
got it (37:09 - 37:13)
none i had to look it up (37:10 - 37:13)
there's nothing wrong with looking it up (37:14 - 37:18)
no (37:17 - 37:21)
but it's one of those it is one of those (37:18 - 37:24)
situations where you've given me the (37:21 - 37:25)
tools (37:24 - 37:29)
your tools work 95 percent of the time (37:25 - 37:31)
so i rely on them and when they aren't (37:29 - 37:33)
working there isn't feedback to tell you (37:31 - 37:34)
they aren't working (37:33 - 37:39)
so you have no clue that (37:34 - 37:40)
you're even missing something you have (37:39 - 37:42)
no clue that the thing that you've been (37:40 - 37:42)
looking (37:42 - 37:44)
for is because you knew you were looking (37:42 - 37:45)
for something (37:44 - 37:47)
well yeah because it the event that was (37:45 - 37:50)
supposed to trigger never triggered (37:47 - 37:52)
and eventually had to find out online (37:50 - 37:54)
why didn't trigger it because the (37:52 - 37:55)
in-game tools didn't tell me (37:54 - 37:58)
somebody out there persisted in trying (37:55 - 37:59)
every possible (37:58 - 38:02)
combination of scenarios and finally (37:59 - 38:04)
figured it out so they could put it (38:02 - 38:05)
online to tell you (38:04 - 38:10)
data miner oh dagnabbit those people (38:05 - 38:10)
i think i think that though my complaint (38:12 - 38:15)
with the meganium is (38:13 - 38:17)
is such like a one percent complaint (38:15 - 38:18)
it's such a time well (38:17 - 38:22)
like correct you are correct (38:18 - 38:26)
but but it just it just shows the (38:22 - 38:30)
like how what's the words (38:26 - 38:31)
like i think why i wanted to start off (38:30 - 38:33)
with the two positives is because of how (38:31 - 38:35)
great the game can actually be (38:33 - 38:37)
and then if you want to continue playing (38:35 - 38:38)
after credits (38:37 - 38:41)
and the tool like i think right then the (38:38 - 38:42)
challenge level (38:41 - 38:45)
increases yes (38:42 - 38:45)
withholding information uh that your (38:45 - 38:49)
tools work 95 (38:48 - 38:51)
of the time and in this situation it (38:49 - 38:52)
doesn't work the five percent of the (38:51 - 38:53)
time (38:52 - 38:55)
and like having no other situation in (38:53 - 38:56)
the entire game (38:55 - 38:57)
being similar to this i don't know maybe (38:56 - 38:59)
maybe the maybe the one of the other (38:57 - 39:01)
bosses is similar to meganium and i (38:59 - 39:01)
haven't (39:01 - 39:04)
done it enough it like it is it is (39:01 - 39:06)
frustrating (39:04 - 39:08)
um and if you already have like one (39:06 - 39:09)
percent of your players are going to (39:08 - 39:11)
play past credits that (39:09 - 39:13)
i'm i'm that i have no facts of that (39:11 - 39:14)
number i'm just saying like (39:13 - 39:16)
uh there's probably gonna be a small (39:14 - 39:17)
amount of players (39:16 - 39:19)
because most players will probably see (39:17 - 39:21)
credits they'll maybe you know go back (39:19 - 39:22)
through a level a couple more times get (39:21 - 39:23)
the legendaries get the mythicals and (39:22 - 39:24)
then be done (39:23 - 39:27)
but for somebody like me who i want to (39:24 - 39:28)
get all (39:27 - 39:30)
the photos i want to get all 4k i want (39:28 - 39:32)
to get all the titles (39:30 - 39:34)
um it is frustrating because i've (39:32 - 39:36)
already given this game 60 hours (39:34 - 39:39)
and i've spent three plus hours on one (39:36 - 39:41)
meganium level and i still haven't (39:39 - 39:43)
gotten the (39:41 - 39:46)
like by the time i was like i got 1.9 (39:43 - 39:48)
million on this course i'm now number (39:46 - 39:50)
one on my friends list of this course (39:48 - 39:53)
and then for somebody to be like there's (39:50 - 39:54)
still two more pokemon in this level and (39:53 - 39:56)
i'm like i cannot do this level anymore (39:54 - 39:58)
it's been three hours i am number one (39:56 - 39:59)
right now welcome (39:58 - 40:03)
to 1984. yes yeah but just because (39:59 - 40:07)
that's how they were in 1984 or 1972 or (40:03 - 40:07)
whatever (40:07 - 40:09)
doesn't mean that we should still be at (40:07 - 40:11)
this point like yes (40:09 - 40:14)
yes we should yes it is just the (40:11 - 40:17)
frustration comes from (40:14 - 40:17)
you've given us tools for discovery and (40:18 - 40:21)
when those (40:20 - 40:25)
tools of discovery don't work for (40:21 - 40:27)
unknown reasons that is just a (40:25 - 40:28)
frustrating experience (40:27 - 40:31)
you just don't (40:28 - 40:31)
you just don't know why they chose or (40:32 - 40:35)
why it's bugged (40:34 - 40:38)
or why in this one instance this thing (40:35 - 40:41)
that i spent three hours looking for (40:38 - 40:44)
the tool just does not work the tool you (40:41 - 40:45)
told me would work (40:44 - 40:48)
and that that is just game design that's (40:45 - 40:50)
super frustrating (40:48 - 40:52)
right and so to tie it all up and finish (40:50 - 40:55)
this conversation (40:52 - 40:57)
when i bonked that pokemon and he fell (40:55 - 40:58)
off the cliff and i was like (40:57 - 41:01)
oh i didn't think of doing this i did it (40:58 - 41:01)
it worked (41:01 - 41:05)
it was like the smile on my face was (41:01 - 41:07)
was huge when i discovered the secret (41:05 - 41:09)
path in the one level by taking a (41:07 - 41:10)
picture of the pokemon taking a picture (41:09 - 41:11)
of the pokemon taking a picture of the (41:10 - 41:12)
pokemon (41:11 - 41:15)
smile my face was huge there's no smile (41:12 - 41:16)
on my face during the meganium level (41:15 - 41:18)
but they could have eaten i did i (41:16 - 41:20)
watched it they could have easily (41:18 - 41:22)
turned that into a moment where i'm (41:20 - 41:23)
smiling if (41:22 - 41:26)
their tools worked if i'm going through (41:23 - 41:28)
like the beach level (41:26 - 41:29)
and i'm like uh i can't figure out what (41:28 - 41:32)
to do to make this pokemon four star (41:29 - 41:34)
i tried the apple i tried the aluminum (41:32 - 41:36)
illuminati ball i've gone through this (41:34 - 41:37)
level 10 times (41:36 - 41:39)
and then it dawns on me like oh i (41:37 - 41:41)
haven't tried the music (41:39 - 41:42)
and then i go back and i try the music (41:41 - 41:44)
and then it works like (41:42 - 41:47)
you did it again awesome now i got a (41:44 - 41:49)
smile on my face because i (41:47 - 41:50)
went through this level 100 times i (41:49 - 41:52)
didn't think of trying the scan feature (41:50 - 41:54)
i didn't think of trying the music (41:52 - 41:55)
i didn't think of throwing the (41:54 - 41:57)
illuminati ball and then trying the (41:55 - 41:58)
music which (41:57 - 42:02)
works on pokemon by the way um (41:58 - 42:05)
like the game is so good at (42:02 - 42:08)
giving you things to do (42:05 - 42:11)
and then once you do them you go (42:08 - 42:14)
oh i should do that in a different level (42:11 - 42:17)
with these pokemon it does such a good (42:14 - 42:18)
job but doing that (42:17 - 42:21)
and none of what i just described (42:18 - 42:22)
applies to the meganium level (42:21 - 42:26)
the meganium level is just its own weird (42:22 - 42:29)
nothing works no scan i've never done (42:26 - 42:30)
apples like this wow (42:29 - 42:32)
the apples don't even go far enough to (42:30 - 42:34)
the tree without me like (42:32 - 42:36)
looking into the sky and not seeing (42:34 - 42:37)
where anything is (42:36 - 42:41)
ah it is it is probably the worst design (42:37 - 42:43)
level which is a shame (42:41 - 42:45)
because shaman there's a joke there (42:43 - 42:47)
somewhere uh because (42:45 - 42:50)
the other because (42:47 - 42:53)
95 of the rest of the game is so (42:50 - 42:57)
solid and then this this level is an (42:53 - 43:00)
outlier (42:57 - 43:02)
i'm not going to argue anymore (43:00 - 43:05)
[Laughter] (43:02 - 43:05)
we should take a break though yes uh (43:06 - 43:10)
when we come back we're going to talk (43:08 - 43:12)
about some katy perry and some (43:10 - 43:16)
pokemon tcg we will be (43:12 - 43:18)
right back (43:16 - 43:18)
tricks lucky charms coco puffs (43:19 - 43:26)
tricks golden grahams cocoa puffs (43:22 - 43:31)
cookie crisps cocoa puffs cinnamon toast (43:26 - 43:31)
crunch (43:39 - 43:42)
[Music] (43:54 - 43:58)
is pretty good too (44:06 - 44:10)
[Music] (44:10 - 44:15)
[Applause] (44:12 - 44:15)
[Music] (44:16 - 44:24)
oh my gosh (44:19 - 44:24)
and we are back from our break (44:25 - 44:32)
uh this is off pokemon.com katy (44:29 - 44:37)
perry and pokemon together celebrate 25 (44:32 - 44:38)
years (44:37 - 44:41)
with katy perry's electric new song (44:38 - 44:43)
and music video the song is called (44:41 - 44:45)
electric (44:43 - 44:47)
it is on katy perry's official youtube (44:45 - 44:48)
channel (44:47 - 44:51)
uh they launched a specific website for (44:48 - 44:53)
it (44:51 - 44:53)
um they have hoodies and (44:54 - 44:59)
shirts with katy perry and pikachu (44:57 - 45:00)
together (44:59 - 45:02)
i don't know i'm assuming you guys (45:00 - 45:03)
listen to the song (45:02 - 45:06)
yes i listened to it and promptly forgot (45:03 - 45:07)
everything about it (45:06 - 45:10)
except oh i've got i've got words except (45:07 - 45:14)
for two things about the video one (45:10 - 45:17)
she's careless about time travel and (45:14 - 45:19)
two i disagree with you on this one but (45:17 - 45:20)
how is she (45:19 - 45:24)
not blind from staring (45:20 - 45:26)
into the light of a lighthouse multiple (45:24 - 45:28)
times (45:26 - 45:32)
because she's a lot electric uh the song (45:28 - 45:33)
is (45:32 - 45:35)
fine like i i am not a katy perry fan i (45:33 - 45:36)
am not a pop fan (45:35 - 45:39)
i listen to it and then the only katy (45:36 - 45:41)
perry song i can think of (45:39 - 45:42)
whenever someone says oh do you listen (45:41 - 45:44)
all i can hear is roar it's the one song (45:42 - 45:45)
that (45:44 - 45:48)
i remember hearing a lot so all i (45:45 - 45:49)
hear is her screaming roar and not (45:48 - 45:51)
electric i couldn't tell you (45:49 - 45:55)
anything about the song but (45:51 - 45:57)
my one complaint is i expected my (45:55 - 46:00)
pokemon (45:57 - 46:03)
music to be more pokemon (46:00 - 46:06)
and less generic pop songs (46:03 - 46:08)
like post malone was a remake of a song (46:06 - 46:09)
that didn't even happen when pokemon (46:08 - 46:10)
came out this is (46:09 - 46:14)
has apart from the electric type (46:10 - 46:18)
and the video nothing that really links (46:14 - 46:20)
it to pokemon (46:18 - 46:23)
and the merchandise is basically katy (46:20 - 46:25)
you would believe pikachu is named katy (46:23 - 46:28)
perry on these shirts (46:25 - 46:30)
i think the merchandise is cute i like (46:28 - 46:33)
the hoodie a lot i mean they're just it (46:30 - 46:36)
it feels weird to be like (46:33 - 46:39)
i want more pokemon for my pokemon 25th (46:36 - 46:41)
anniversary i don't (46:39 - 46:43)
i it's striking me as weird that it's (46:41 - 46:45)
much more a vehicle about (46:43 - 46:50)
their them just putting out a single (46:45 - 46:52)
then it is like really tiny it looks (46:50 - 46:54)
like the first mewtwo movie it was all (46:52 - 46:56)
none of those songs were pokemon it was (46:54 - 46:57)
like m2m (46:56 - 47:00)
but but uh but the soundtrack for a (46:57 - 47:01)
movie which is (47:00 - 47:03)
establishing that the soundtrack doesn't (47:01 - 47:04)
relate to it (47:03 - 47:06)
it's like saying we're going to put out (47:04 - 47:09)
the 2b a master album but none of these (47:06 - 47:10)
songs relate to pokemon (47:09 - 47:14)
like this is the 25th anniversary music (47:10 - 47:18)
of the franchise and they're (47:14 - 47:18)
tangentially a based at best it's a lose (47:18 - 47:22)
connection (47:21 - 47:24)
some would say a year is you know more (47:22 - 47:26)
exciting than a movie you've got a (47:24 - 47:29)
the soundtrack of 2021 over here i think (47:26 - 47:30)
the year (47:29 - 47:33)
should be more focused on pokemon (47:30 - 47:37)
and less on general i wonder if uh (47:33 - 47:40)
non-pokemon songs verse generic (47:37 - 47:43)
not maybe generic is the right word but (47:40 - 47:45)
you know pop songs (47:43 - 47:48)
hold up the test of time better i mean (47:45 - 47:49)
we can all look at the (47:48 - 47:51)
like diamond and pearl theme songs where (47:49 - 47:53)
they're like rap is real real (47:51 - 47:55)
hot looking like the theme song to (47:53 - 47:56)
diamond and pearl with a little (47:55 - 47:59)
you gotta do the challenges like no one (47:56 - 48:00)
wanted (47:59 - 48:01)
like at the time i don't even think (48:00 - 48:03)
people thought that was cool but it's (48:01 - 48:05)
definitely not cool now like those are (48:03 - 48:06)
some those are some of the worst (48:05 - 48:10)
time songs the poker wrap is timeless so (48:06 - 48:12)
let's poke a hole in that balloon right (48:10 - 48:13)
now (48:12 - 48:15)
uh that will what are your thoughts (48:13 - 48:17)
because you're much more of the pop (48:15 - 48:21)
pop princess i i will try to (48:17 - 48:25)
make a nice sandwich for folks here (48:21 - 48:28)
number one that crochet dress i i could (48:25 - 48:30)
make that but i did appreciate (48:28 - 48:33)
that crochet fashion is top of the line (48:30 - 48:34)
coming back (48:33 - 48:38)
or whatever so (48:34 - 48:40)
congratulations on that lovely crochet (48:38 - 48:42)
dress (48:40 - 48:46)
uh number two taylor swift called from (48:42 - 48:47)
2020 (48:46 - 48:50)
and wants her aesthetic back uh (48:47 - 48:53)
number three i don't think the time (48:50 - 48:54)
travel issue (48:53 - 48:57)
was a problem in the video she was (48:54 - 49:00)
just happened to self-create her own (48:57 - 49:01)
career (49:00 - 49:05)
that's the time travel paradox (49:01 - 49:07)
if she wasn't time traveled she never (49:05 - 49:08)
would have seen the talent show (49:07 - 49:12)
sign and so what happened the first time (49:08 - 49:14)
when she didn't time travel there was no (49:12 - 49:18)
time there is always (49:14 - 49:18)
how did you like your princess your (49:22 - 49:25)
goddess (49:24 - 49:28)
your teenage dream fireworking roaring (49:25 - 49:31)
i feel like star i don't love roar that (49:28 - 49:34)
much fireworks is okay (49:31 - 49:37)
uh as somebody who (49:34 - 49:39)
i feel like i have to prove receipts (49:37 - 49:41)
like katy perry (49:39 - 49:43)
what's her cat's name what's her cat's (49:41 - 49:44)
name (49:43 - 49:46)
what's her first album where did she get (49:44 - 49:48)
her start wait you don't know katy (49:46 - 49:49)
perry's cat's name (49:48 - 49:52)
oh my gosh this is the most common katy (49:49 - 49:54)
perry fact in the universe (49:52 - 49:59)
it's caddy perry it's kitty purry (49:54 - 49:59)
i fell off a lot of music but i fell off (50:05 - 50:09)
katy perry after the dancing sharks but (50:07 - 50:10)
i do love the (50:09 - 50:11)
i love the dancing sharks they're very (50:10 - 50:14)
good everybody loves the left shark (50:11 - 50:17)
yeah yeah the sharks are great right (50:14 - 50:18)
shark did the job (50:17 - 50:20)
left shark phoned it in and we all loved (50:18 - 50:23)
left shark for feeling how we all feel (50:20 - 50:25)
i remember when i kissed the girl was on (50:23 - 50:26)
the radio and it was very (50:25 - 50:29)
controversial controversial um (50:26 - 50:32)
and i was like i need i i need to know (50:29 - 50:34)
more about this musician (50:32 - 50:36)
and then i got the album and it was good (50:34 - 50:38)
and then i got the follow-up album and (50:36 - 50:39)
it was good and then i got carly ray (50:38 - 50:40)
jumps and (50:39 - 50:42)
jepson's album and that was also pretty (50:40 - 50:43)
good anyways (50:42 - 50:45)
i like i like pop music and now and then (50:43 - 50:47)
this song (50:45 - 50:49)
very unforgettable there's nothing (50:47 - 50:52)
specific very forgettable oh yeah (50:49 - 50:55)
very forgettable there was nothing that (50:52 - 50:57)
really stood out there it wasn't like (50:55 - 50:59)
it was fine it felt like a filler song (50:57 - 51:00)
on one of her albums (50:59 - 51:02)
that's what it felt like it didn't feel (51:00 - 51:06)
like a radio hit like a pillow yeah yeah (51:02 - 51:08)
it felt like a track that was cut from (51:06 - 51:09)
taylor swift's folklore (51:08 - 51:12)
is what it sounds like the music video (51:09 - 51:13)
was super cute (51:12 - 51:16)
the music video is cute the the (51:13 - 51:20)
the song is fine but i (51:16 - 51:23)
for a moment like for an already (51:20 - 51:26)
disappointing 25th anniversary event (51:23 - 51:28)
like this was the big thing i really (51:26 - 51:29)
wanted (51:28 - 51:32)
i really wanted (51:29 - 51:32)
something inspiring or something great (51:32 - 51:36)
and it's (51:35 - 51:38)
like if you really love katy perry and (51:36 - 51:39)
you really love that song (51:38 - 51:44)
great but as a non as a pokemon fan (51:39 - 51:47)
but a not not a katy perry or a pop fan (51:44 - 51:50)
it it again i immediate i listened to it (51:47 - 51:52)
i watched it and then immediately forgot (51:50 - 51:52)
about it (51:52 - 51:55)
like i know it's called electric i think (51:52 - 51:56)
she says electric (51:55 - 51:58)
a lot (51:56 - 51:58)
something about your life being electric (51:59 - 52:03)
i think is the (52:02 - 52:07)
chorus i don't know uh yeah so her (52:03 - 52:09)
her first album i remember seeing katy (52:07 - 52:10)
perry on (52:09 - 52:14)
warped tour when she was traveling (52:10 - 52:16)
with um i believe at the time she was (52:14 - 52:17)
dating the lead (52:16 - 52:19)
singer of gym class heroes if i remember (52:17 - 52:21)
correctly (52:19 - 52:24)
uh so when i saw katy perry on warped (52:21 - 52:25)
tour it would have been (52:24 - 52:29)
i think 2008 2009 that's when obviously (52:25 - 52:30)
i kissed a girl was (52:29 - 52:34)
on the radio i'm kind of shocked (52:30 - 52:36)
a little bit that you went and saw the (52:34 - 52:38)
warp tour wow i went to (52:36 - 52:40)
i went to warped tour five years in a (52:38 - 52:41)
row i think why (52:40 - 52:44)
oh you missed you missed the whole sky i (52:41 - 52:45)
was gator (52:44 - 52:47)
skate (52:45 - 52:48)
[Applause] (52:47 - 52:50)
i don't know you have such a i don't (52:48 - 52:52)
want to be in crowds i don't even want (52:50 - 52:53)
to go to a movie theater (52:52 - 52:55)
the thought of going to the warp tour oh (52:53 - 52:57)
yeah but (52:55 - 52:59)
warp tour is cool because like you have (52:57 - 53:02)
like six stages well warped tours done i (52:59 - 53:02)
think they (53:02 - 53:03)
closed up i don't think they exist (53:02 - 53:05)
anymore you have like six stages (53:03 - 53:08)
and um (53:05 - 53:10)
it wasn't it's not like summerfest like (53:08 - 53:12)
you can see the stage even if you're (53:10 - 53:14)
you know five miles back because you (53:12 - 53:16)
know (53:14 - 53:18)
they put benches on in front of all the (53:16 - 53:19)
stages and everyone just stands on the (53:18 - 53:20)
benches and now everyone's three feet (53:19 - 53:22)
taller because (53:20 - 53:26)
so standing is pointless um (53:22 - 53:28)
yeah i remember gosh i can't believe i (53:26 - 53:29)
just remembered this (53:28 - 53:32)
right now but yeah it was uh (53:29 - 53:35)
the warped tour crowd was not a (53:32 - 53:38)
fan of katy perry well i'm not so they (53:35 - 53:39)
had (53:38 - 53:42)
so warped tour had like six stages they (53:39 - 53:43)
had like the main stage a and the main (53:42 - 53:44)
stage b (53:43 - 53:47)
i don't know why i you know on a pokemon (53:44 - 53:49)
podcast i don't think i ever thought i (53:47 - 53:50)
would be explaining warped to her (53:49 - 53:52)
but what would happen you brought it up (53:50 - 53:53)
what would happen (53:52 - 53:57)
is that um like stage a (53:53 - 53:59)
would go on and then stage b would be (53:57 - 54:00)
setting up (53:59 - 54:03)
and then when stage a was done as soon (54:00 - 54:04)
as they finished stage b (54:03 - 54:06)
would be ready to go so like every 30 (54:04 - 54:08)
minutes each stage would be (54:06 - 54:10)
rotating artists and then there were (54:08 - 54:13)
smaller stages that would also do that (54:10 - 54:15)
so when i saw katy perry live for the (54:13 - 54:17)
first time again as a katy perry fan i (54:15 - 54:19)
kissed a girl and i liked it you know (54:17 - 54:21)
i'm one of the boys that was i believe (54:19 - 54:22)
the name of her album (54:21 - 54:25)
uh well no the album was called katy (54:22 - 54:26)
perry one of the boys was what the first (54:25 - 54:27)
track on the album (54:26 - 54:29)
no i think one of the boys was the oh (54:27 - 54:31)
you're right yes (54:29 - 54:34)
correct so i'm (54:31 - 54:38)
waiting in the crowd to see katy perry (54:34 - 54:39)
i'm like (54:38 - 54:41)
second third row you're right i don't (54:39 - 54:42)
like being in crowds greg this is a (54:41 - 54:44)
different time when i was okay with like (54:42 - 54:47)
people bumping into me (54:44 - 54:50)
this is not imagine you with a bunch of (54:47 - 54:52)
beer bros at the warp tool getting beer (54:50 - 54:54)
spilled on you and being (54:52 - 54:57)
happy about it uh warp tour is not a (54:54 - 54:58)
beer bro tour (54:57 - 54:59)
remember it's vans it was it was the (54:58 - 55:01)
skate it was more of (54:59 - 55:05)
your skaters yeah skaters spilling jager (55:01 - 55:05)
on you (55:05 - 55:08)
i will correct myself and so katy perry (55:05 - 55:09)
was on (55:08 - 55:12)
katy perry was on a smaller stage and (55:09 - 55:14)
so the stages were right next to each (55:12 - 55:16)
other so you had two huge crowds because (55:14 - 55:17)
one crowd would be waiting for (55:16 - 55:18)
the artist the other crowd would be (55:17 - 55:20)
watching the other artists and then i (55:18 - 55:21)
had to suffer through (55:20 - 55:24)
some underoath knockoff i'm not a huge (55:21 - 55:25)
fan of under oath (55:24 - 55:29)
but they were like screamo heart like (55:25 - 55:31)
and i'm that music was cool with me but (55:29 - 55:32)
this was like (55:31 - 55:34)
budget under oath over here and their (55:32 - 55:35)
crowd is (55:34 - 55:38)
very rowdy and katy perry came (55:35 - 55:42)
on after them and rowdy budget under (55:38 - 55:43)
oath crowd (55:42 - 55:46)
very not happy that katy perry is that (55:43 - 55:47)
warped to her (55:46 - 55:49)
and proceeded to throw water bottles at (55:47 - 55:50)
her (55:49 - 55:52)
um and hit her with multiple water (55:50 - 55:53)
bottles and i felt (55:52 - 55:57)
awful but dang what a champ she she (55:53 - 56:00)
she finished she did her all set um (55:57 - 56:04)
do the job you were paid for people (56:00 - 56:07)
but yeah i i really like katy perry um (56:04 - 56:08)
at least (56:07 - 56:10)
her first two albums i absolutely love (56:08 - 56:12)
them this song though (56:10 - 56:14)
i it was it felt like a fuller song to (56:12 - 56:15)
me and i know some people really liked (56:14 - 56:16)
it but i there are a lot of people (56:15 - 56:17)
really like it like (56:16 - 56:20)
i have i have huge just (56:17 - 56:23)
in general problems with i kissed a girl (56:20 - 56:24)
uh as a song (56:23 - 56:27)
and as how things were presented so like (56:24 - 56:30)
the other songs on that album is i think (56:27 - 56:32)
i think katy perry started off very much (56:30 - 56:34)
on the wrong foot with a person that (56:32 - 56:36)
already doesn't like pop music so (56:34 - 56:39)
katy perry has never been a part of my (56:36 - 56:39)
wait (56:39 - 56:42)
like i wrote her off after that i'm like (56:39 - 56:43)
i don't need this (56:42 - 56:47)
how do you feel greg about dua lipa (56:43 - 56:50)
i have never listened oh i (56:47 - 56:50)
all the plans for the remainder of this (56:53 - 56:56)
week (56:55 - 56:59)
are now in question they better i (56:56 - 57:00)
couldn't (56:59 - 57:04)
i could before go to your spotify (57:00 - 57:08)
okay and find dualipas levitating (57:04 - 57:10)
not the one that has the baby on it (57:08 - 57:12)
though you don't want to hear the baby (57:10 - 57:16)
does the plane do it all on her own (57:12 - 57:18)
link it in chat and i'll listen to it i (57:16 - 57:21)
promise eventually (57:18 - 57:21)
uh (57:21 - 57:24)
yeah i kissed a pikachu and it was (57:25 - 57:30)
shocking (57:29 - 57:34)
i'm into that i'm missing that (57:30 - 57:38)
that sounds like a billboard hit (57:34 - 57:38)
um (57:39 - 57:42)
it's cool that they like launched merch (57:40 - 57:45)
with her it's cool that (57:42 - 57:48)
she's doing this that she like i i would (57:45 - 57:50)
hope sasha assumed that she's like (57:48 - 57:52)
really into pokemon and she was excited (57:50 - 57:53)
to do a song and she was excited to do (57:52 - 57:54)
the music video (57:53 - 57:56)
and well i mean did you not see the (57:54 - 57:58)
video she grew up with a pichu i did we (57:56 - 58:00)
didn't see it evolve into a pikachu but (57:58 - 58:02)
she grew up with a pichu (58:00 - 58:04)
they must have been good friends i wish (58:02 - 58:05)
i liked the song more (58:04 - 58:07)
it just doesn't it just didn't jump out (58:05 - 58:09)
to me i mean i feel like if i liked the (58:07 - 58:11)
song as much as i liked (58:09 - 58:13)
you know hotter hot and cold or teenage (58:11 - 58:15)
dream or whatever other (58:13 - 58:18)
songs i can't remember her track listing (58:15 - 58:20)
um i feel like i would actually would (58:18 - 58:21)
have gone out and bought the shirt but (58:20 - 58:23)
i i don't know i love those i don't know (58:21 - 58:25)
i i wish i wasn't (58:23 - 58:28)
a cynical gen xer sometimes because i (58:25 - 58:29)
could i just look at the merchandise i (58:28 - 58:32)
look at the song and i'm like (58:29 - 58:35)
this was just a phoned in cash grab see (58:32 - 58:37)
that's what i hope it's not i hope that (58:35 - 58:40)
she's genuinely excited to do it (58:37 - 58:42)
[Laughter] (58:40 - 58:44)
if the song feels phoned in the (58:42 - 58:45)
everything (58:44 - 58:47)
on the website is like i'm going to slap (58:45 - 58:48)
a pikachu (58:47 - 58:51)
on a katy perry t-shirt (58:48 - 58:55)
and sell it and it just feels very (58:51 - 58:57)
cash grabby to me because i'm a cynical (58:55 - 59:01)
gen xer and i don't trust anything (58:57 - 59:01)
i kind of had a thought towards the end (59:02 - 59:06)
of the video of (59:04 - 59:08)
oh she just did this for the free trip (59:06 - 59:10)
to hawaii (59:08 - 59:10)
i may also be a cynical gen x yeah (59:11 - 59:17)
you've got a couple real big cynics (59:14 - 59:19)
uh but i think i think so far between (59:17 - 59:20)
the two songs (59:19 - 59:24)
as they've been released i am (59:20 - 59:26)
i like that post malone song i just wish (59:24 - 59:27)
they were (59:26 - 59:31)
pokemon related more than they are (59:27 - 59:35)
i just wished for a 25th anniversary (59:31 - 59:38)
event i felt the poke (59:35 - 59:40)
i felt it was much more that they were (59:38 - 59:42)
making songs (59:40 - 59:44)
specifically for this event in this (59:42 - 59:45)
company and not (59:44 - 59:47)
we're gonna have tie-ins we'll have an (59:45 - 59:50)
animated post malone in a pokemon world (59:47 - 59:53)
we'll have a real-life katy perry in a (59:50 - 59:54)
pokemon video (59:53 - 59:58)
and that's our tie-in and that bothers (59:54 - 59:58)
me (59:59 - 60:04)
i mean i'm okay with it but i also (60:01 - 60:08)
i also well like it's weird who buys (60:04 - 60:09)
music anymore (60:08 - 60:11)
like they're like they're selling the (60:09 - 60:13)
album you're like you can pre-order (60:11 - 60:14)
right now it's like 10 bucks (60:13 - 60:17)
or whatever i mean i'm gonna can i go my (60:14 - 60:18)
soapbox like (60:17 - 60:20)
if you like an artist please please buy (60:18 - 60:21)
their music (60:20 - 60:24)
yes streaming doesn't pay them enough (60:21 - 60:24)
please (60:24 - 60:28)
also if you if you like their music (60:24 - 60:30)
enough that you want to listen over and (60:28 - 60:32)
over again make sure that you own it so (60:30 - 60:33)
that a company (60:32 - 60:35)
can't take away your rights from it like (60:33 - 60:38)
get a copy of it that's your own (60:35 - 60:40)
it goes more money goes to the artist (60:38 - 60:41)
that you like but (60:40 - 60:44)
also like spotify can't decide that they (60:41 - 60:46)
no longer want to work with this artist (60:44 - 60:48)
and you lose access to all their music (60:46 - 60:50)
because you never bought it so just i (60:48 - 60:51)
think probably all the people on this (60:50 - 60:52)
album (60:51 - 60:55)
probably don't have to worry about money (60:52 - 60:55)
so far i don't think katy perry or post (60:56 - 60:59)
malone have any (60:57 - 61:02)
money problems yeah we said that about (60:59 - 61:03)
mc hammer too (61:02 - 61:06)
yeah everybody says that but everybody (61:03 - 61:08)
needs a paycheck sometime (61:06 - 61:10)
jeremy irons said the dungeons and (61:08 - 61:13)
dragons movie so he could buy a new car (61:10 - 61:17)
so let's be real about how money works (61:13 - 61:17)
also for clarification i can't really (61:18 - 61:22)
tell if that dress is knit or crochet (61:19 - 61:27)
but it is a yarn fiber it's a cute dress (61:22 - 61:30)
all right uh (61:27 - 61:30)
we got some local news here (61:30 - 61:34)
i'm ready for it i'm ready for it all (61:37 - 61:41)
right so the the (61:40 - 61:44)
the premise of this is not funny (61:41 - 61:48)
i think where the funny comes in is it's (61:44 - 61:50)
literally the target i go to so the (61:48 - 61:51)
funny is (61:50 - 61:53)
funny it starts out with it's wisconsin (61:51 - 61:54)
yeah the funny (61:53 - 61:56)
is like oh i was just there three days (61:54 - 61:57)
ago and (61:56 - 62:01)
this happened um i have also been to (61:57 - 62:01)
this target (62:01 - 62:04)
yes uh (62:01 - 62:08)
so this off waypoint from vice um (62:04 - 62:11)
man pulls gun in a trading card related (62:08 - 62:13)
attack in a target parking lot (62:11 - 62:14)
i like this article because it's not as (62:13 - 62:18)
clickbaity as the other ones um (62:14 - 62:18)
so a break (62:19 - 62:22)
a fight broke out in target parking lot (62:23 - 62:28)
in brookfield wisconsin on friday (62:26 - 62:31)
soon after the store restarts restocked (62:28 - 62:32)
trading cards police arrived to the (62:31 - 62:34)
scene when a witness called them after (62:32 - 62:36)
one man pulled a gun according to a (62:34 - 62:39)
local news report a group of men (62:36 - 62:41)
uh was attacking the gun owner when he (62:39 - 62:43)
pulled out the weapon the target and the (62:41 - 62:44)
trader joe's (62:43 - 62:47)
ironically enough i went to the trader (62:44 - 62:48)
joe's yesterday (62:47 - 62:50)
uh went into a lockdown for an hour (62:48 - 62:52)
until police arrived (62:50 - 62:54)
the man never fired his weapon no one (62:52 - 62:56)
was seriously injured according to (62:54 - 62:56)
police (62:56 - 62:59)
the incident occurred on may 7th at 8 20 (62:56 - 63:01)
a.m outside of target store remember (62:59 - 63:02)
target would only sell (63:01 - 63:05)
cards at 8 a.m on fridays uh which has (63:02 - 63:07)
been a policy of being collecting (63:05 - 63:09)
merchandise according to the police (63:07 - 63:09)
report (63:09 - 63:12)
four men attacked a fifth man when he (63:09 - 63:14)
exited the target carrying a box of (63:12 - 63:17)
sports cards (63:14 - 63:19)
four men have been arrested and charged (63:17 - 63:21)
with battery uh (63:19 - 63:23)
strangulation and disorderly contact (63:21 - 63:24)
conduct (63:23 - 63:26)
pulling a gun during a parking lot (63:24 - 63:28)
scuffle is just the latest story (63:26 - 63:29)
attached to the current resurgence of (63:28 - 63:30)
collecting cards (63:29 - 63:32)
sports magic the gathering and pokemon (63:30 - 63:34)
cards have become so (63:32 - 63:36)
sought over that stores cannot keep them (63:34 - 63:37)
in demand (63:36 - 63:39)
it is also causing a labor crisis as (63:37 - 63:41)
companies that professionally grade (63:39 - 63:42)
cards cannot (63:41 - 63:44)
keep up with the avalanche of cards (63:42 - 63:45)
we've seen this past year we've talked (63:44 - 63:46)
about that with psa (63:45 - 63:49)
i feel like labor crisis is the right (63:46 - 63:50)
word i also think that (63:49 - 63:52)
uh wizards of the coast paid advice to (63:50 - 63:54)
put magic of the gathering in there (63:52 - 63:55)
because you could find those cards (63:54 - 63:57)
literally everywhere there's never been (63:55 - 63:58)
a magic crisis (63:57 - 64:01)
i bought well time spiral but i (63:58 - 64:05)
bought magic cards at target two day (64:01 - 64:08)
two day hey maybe (64:05 - 64:10)
because target is pulling cards which is (64:08 - 64:11)
our next article (64:10 - 64:14)
maybe the magic will be next no no but (64:11 - 64:14)
they're not (64:14 - 64:17)
oh i mean they're not playing magic (64:14 - 64:19)
cards but yes right (64:17 - 64:21)
uh it is common to have 50 plus people (64:19 - 64:23)
standing in line all day six to eight (64:21 - 64:25)
hours waiting to see if they can get one (64:23 - 64:26)
box of cards brookfield sports (64:25 - 64:27)
memorabilia (64:26 - 64:31)
memorabilia store owner jeff told wisn (64:27 - 64:32)
12 news (64:31 - 64:34)
target had previously promised to call (64:32 - 64:35)
the police on (64:34 - 64:37)
rowdy customers but is unclear who (64:35 - 64:39)
notified the cops in brookfield (64:37 - 64:41)
target has already altered its policy (64:39 - 64:42)
limiting the number of collectible items (64:41 - 64:44)
that can be purchased in a day (64:42 - 64:46)
only sell selling the items briefly on (64:44 - 64:47)
friday mornings (64:46 - 64:49)
and asking customers not to wait in the (64:47 - 64:51)
parking lot overnight (64:49 - 64:53)
you know as funny as the local news (64:51 - 64:55)

insight on this (64:55 - 64:59)

may 14th the retailer the retailer cites (65:34 - 65:39)
an abundance of caution for both safety (65:37 - 65:41)
of the guests and store employees and (65:39 - 65:42)
notes (65:41 - 65:43)
that it will be selling cards on its (65:42 - 65:45)
website only (65:43 - 65:46)
currently pokemon cards and other (65:45 - 65:49)
trading cards have a moment (65:46 - 65:51)
uh it's it's sports cards you can just (65:49 - 65:52)
say sports cards yeah (65:51 - 65:55)
uh versus not magic uh or you could it's (65:52 - 65:56)
definitely not yugioh (65:55 - 65:59)
like people the tweet that they attach (65:56 - 65:59)
clearly has (65:59 - 66:02)
magic cards waiting to be purchased (65:59 - 66:03)
behind it (66:02 - 66:06)
uh people have swamped the card grading (66:03 - 66:08)
companies hoping to get their ratings on (66:06 - 66:10)
cards more valuable the pokemon (66:08 - 66:11)
company has been rushing to print enough (66:10 - 66:13)
cards to meet demand and it (66:11 - 66:15)
uh seems that all big numbers around (66:13 - 66:17)
truly rare original cards have caused a (66:15 - 66:19)
lot of new excitement about cards as (66:17 - 66:21)
well (66:19 - 66:21)
and then they talk about how target (66:22 - 66:26)
started limiting cards (66:23 - 66:28)
and that's that's the the gist of it so (66:26 - 66:29)
uh target (66:28 - 66:32)
is done selling pokemon cards for now (66:29 - 66:33)
they said that (66:32 - 66:37)
they will probably come back (66:33 - 66:39)
um (66:37 - 66:39)
so i have some thoughts on this i don't (66:43 - 66:47)
want to sugarcoat (66:45 - 66:51)
that pokemon cards are not (66:47 - 66:54)
in demand i mean they are (66:51 - 66:56)
but the i feel like out of all these (66:54 - 66:58)
stories and i feel like this show (66:56 - 67:01)
included we have really kind of pushed (66:58 - 67:02)
aside (67:01 - 67:05)
how big the sports card market is right (67:02 - 67:07)
now (67:05 - 67:11)
market is huge and and if (67:07 - 67:14)
and so this is what's happening um and (67:11 - 67:15)
this is not (67:14 - 67:17)
what like uh like obviously people still (67:15 - 67:19)
want pokemon cards (67:17 - 67:20)
although i would say it's kind of died (67:19 - 67:23)
down with battle styles (67:20 - 67:26)
and i'll get to that um but (67:23 - 67:29)
what is happening is the sports cards (67:26 - 67:33)
are worth way more than pokemon cards (67:29 - 67:36)
so these resellers will wait in line at (67:33 - 67:38)
target at 8 am (67:36 - 67:41)
and they plan (67:38 - 67:44)
all of them most of them (67:41 - 67:46)
almost all of them plan on getting (67:44 - 67:47)
sports cards (67:46 - 67:50)
and if there are not sports cards they (67:47 - 67:51)
will then (67:50 - 67:54)
default to pokemon cards because they're (67:51 - 67:56)
not waiting in line for two hours to (67:54 - 67:59)
leave empty-handed they are they need to (67:56 - 68:03)
resell something um (67:59 - 68:06)
and so the sports card market (68:03 - 68:10)
is directly hurting the pokemon market (68:06 - 68:13)
because scalpers need to walk away with (68:10 - 68:14)
something (68:13 - 68:17)
and pokemon cards still can be flipped (68:14 - 68:19)
for a slight profit not as much as it (68:17 - 68:21)
used to be with vivid voltage (68:19 - 68:24)
and darkness ablaze and shining fates (68:21 - 68:25)
and champions path (68:24 - 68:28)
because let me tell you (68:25 - 68:28)
no one is buying battle styles at an (68:28 - 68:32)
increased price and if they are they're (68:30 - 68:34)
truly desperate because there's (68:32 - 68:36)
nothing fantastic in that set there's no (68:34 - 68:39)
charizards there's no pikachus um (68:36 - 68:41)
and uh no one knows who a nurse shifu is (68:39 - 68:42)
besides (68:41 - 68:46)
people who listen to this podcast um (68:42 - 68:48)
now i am not saying that if target (68:46 - 68:49)
didn't sell sports cards (68:48 - 68:52)
it would that pokemon card the pokemon (68:49 - 68:54)
card issue would be fixed there are (68:52 - 68:55)
still (68:54 - 68:56)
plenty of people who are reselling (68:55 - 68:58)
pokemon cards there are still plenty of (68:56 - 69:00)
people who are buying as many as they (68:58 - 69:01)
can to pull the good ones to then sell (69:00 - 69:03)
them individually as singles those (69:01 - 69:04)
people still exist (69:03 - 69:07)
but i am i am saying that this show and (69:04 - 69:09)
a lot of these websites reporting are (69:07 - 69:11)
really (69:09 - 69:14)
just ignoring the fact that sports cards (69:11 - 69:18)
are out of control right now um (69:14 - 69:20)
and i mean i wouldn't say that we're (69:18 - 69:21)
ignoring it (69:20 - 69:23)
i mean we acknowledge it but that's not (69:21 - 69:24)
the point of our show well it's like (69:23 - 69:24)
it's not (69:24 - 69:28)
uh yeah so i think ignore is the wrong (69:24 - 69:29)
word but it's not (69:28 - 69:31)
our emphasis this is not our focus well (69:29 - 69:33)
when you look at people reporting on (69:31 - 69:34)
this (69:33 - 69:36)
the thing that grabs headlines is (69:34 - 69:38)
pokemon cards right right (69:36 - 69:39)
well it's never like children are in (69:38 - 69:42)
danger there's your (69:39 - 69:45)
your correlation right there (69:42 - 69:45)
like uh i was listening to another (69:46 - 69:49)
gaming podcast and and (69:47 - 69:52)
one week they were like oh yeah i guess (69:49 - 69:53)
they're limiting sports cards i don't (69:52 - 69:55)
know why we all know everyone's there (69:53 - 69:57)
for pokemon cards and the following week (69:55 - 69:58)
they were like oh (69:57 - 70:00)
i didn't know that sports cards were (69:58 - 70:01)
like this huge thing (70:00 - 70:04)
and it's like and so when you read these (70:01 - 70:05)
headlines of like oh they're pulling (70:04 - 70:06)
pokemon cards (70:05 - 70:09)
like yeah but they're also pulling the (70:06 - 70:10)
actual problem here yeah (70:09 - 70:13)
which is the sports cards cards and i (70:10 - 70:15)
i don't even know where i can go on the (70:13 - 70:18)
internet to learn more about this like (70:15 - 70:21)
i don't know what about i've i've been (70:18 - 70:22)
told that the sports card boxes are (70:21 - 70:23)
twenty dollars (70:22 - 70:25)
and then they sell them for a hundred (70:23 - 70:26)
and fifty dollars (70:25 - 70:30)
um i don't know if is it a specific card (70:26 - 70:33)
that people want is it like uh it's like (70:30 - 70:35)
players it's players players (70:33 - 70:38)
it's so i worked at i worked at a card (70:35 - 70:38)
shop (70:38 - 70:42)
uh for a while in my twenties um (70:38 - 70:46)
and it it really it varies but just like (70:42 - 70:48)
just like in pokemon certain things (70:46 - 70:50)
become super expensive or super rare or (70:48 - 70:51)
super (70:50 - 70:53)
sought out it's the same thing with (70:51 - 70:54)
sports i mean they can be much more (70:53 - 70:56)
targeted because (70:54 - 70:58)
you know you're looking for x player or (70:56 - 71:00)
x team or x whatever (70:58 - 71:05)
um but the reality is is there are way (71:00 - 71:08)
more sports card collectors than there (71:05 - 71:12)
are pokemon card players yes like there (71:08 - 71:13)
are (71:12 - 71:17)
sports cards and sports memorabilia has (71:13 - 71:20)
a huge audience a huge uh (71:17 - 71:22)
history of these cards being in the (71:20 - 71:23)
public eye people (71:22 - 71:27)
know what they are uh they only make (71:23 - 71:30)
so many teams change so it's not like (71:27 - 71:32)
you know they're going to reprint you (71:30 - 71:35)
know the twins lineup from 85 again in a (71:32 - 71:36)
2020 set (71:35 - 71:39)
but with new card mechanics like they (71:36 - 71:42)
are tied to specific things and (71:39 - 71:44)
you know some things can come back but (71:42 - 71:46)
in general you like (71:44 - 71:49)
the amount of the sports card market and (71:46 - 71:51)
the amount of people that collect it (71:49 - 71:54)
when i worked at schinder's news and (71:51 - 71:55)
books (71:54 - 71:58)
the absolute top (71:55 - 72:01)
selling thing the thing we made (71:58 - 72:05)
the most money on with sports cards (72:01 - 72:07)
uh shortly after that was adult (72:05 - 72:10)
materials but number one (72:07 - 72:13)
was sports cards can i ask a dumb (72:10 - 72:13)
question (72:13 - 72:15)
yeah you can't do anything with sports (72:13 - 72:17)
cards right why do you put them in a (72:15 - 72:17)
binder (72:17 - 72:19)
no no i know that but like with pokemon (72:17 - 72:21)
cards like (72:19 - 72:23)
no there's no you can there's a game to (72:21 - 72:24)
it i mean so (72:23 - 72:26)
there are usually like stats and trivia (72:24 - 72:27)
and stuff on the back of the garden (72:26 - 72:29)
stuff about the player so (72:27 - 72:31)
the chewing gum don't forget the chewing (72:29 - 72:32)
gum no (72:31 - 72:34)
that was a thing like there are people (72:32 - 72:36)
who are so mad that uh (72:34 - 72:39)
like they would specifically ask for (72:36 - 72:41)
packs where they could (72:39 - 72:44)
uh see that the chewing gum was still (72:41 - 72:45)
slightly (72:44 - 72:47)
pliable because it wouldn't have ruined (72:45 - 72:48)
the card that it was on and then (72:47 - 72:50)
eventually sporting card (72:48 - 72:52)
people just stopped putting the gun in (72:50 - 72:54)
all together because it was ruining the (72:52 - 72:56)
card value (72:54 - 72:58)
uh no sports card collecting is (72:56 - 72:59)
displaying (72:58 - 73:01)
right like you have cards you're putting (72:59 - 73:02)
them in frames people put them in frames (73:01 - 73:04)
they have their favorite players (73:02 - 73:06)
they bring those cars like there used to (73:04 - 73:07)
be (73:06 - 73:09)
and it will probably come back but (73:07 - 73:10)
downtown minneapolis (73:09 - 73:13)
has a hotel where sports stars would (73:10 - 73:14)
stay in (73:13 - 73:17)
a specific hotel and then every (73:14 - 73:20)
friday morning there would be a line up (73:17 - 73:20)
of (73:20 - 73:22)
people waiting to get their cards (73:20 - 73:24)
autographed because they were glossy (73:22 - 73:25)
pictures (73:24 - 73:26)
with their name and stuff and they would (73:25 - 73:28)
get it autographed that would bring the (73:26 - 73:29)
price up (73:28 - 73:31)
so like there's a huge culture around (73:29 - 73:32)
sports cards that (73:31 - 73:34)
is just like displaying it or getting it (73:32 - 73:37)
signed by your person but (73:34 - 73:38)
no there's no game to it you don't play (73:37 - 73:40)
with them you don't (73:38 - 73:42)
it's just that they're appearing long (73:40 - 73:44)
history and lore it's like (73:42 - 73:47)
maybe in the 1950s everybody was like oh (73:44 - 73:49)
these baseball cards are just for kids (73:47 - 73:52)
but like by the 80s it was like do you (73:49 - 73:55)
have the 1957 (73:52 - 73:58)
joe palace jack because that one has (73:55 - 74:00)
like one pixel off in the print and (73:58 - 74:01)
that's worth about (74:00 - 74:04)
250 000 in my store (74:01 - 74:08)
we had we had because we also sold magic (74:04 - 74:09)
cards and that was when the black lotus (74:08 - 74:12)
the original was high priced right yeah (74:09 - 74:13)
so (74:12 - 74:16)
we had a black lotus for 200 for a (74:13 - 74:17)
hundred dollars in (74:16 - 74:20)
behind the case that paled (74:17 - 74:23)
in comparison to the one (74:20 - 74:26)
thousand dollar card that was sealed in (74:23 - 74:27)
a large (74:26 - 74:30)
wedge of plastic that was in two cases (74:27 - 74:33)
that was locked down because somebody (74:30 - 74:35)
could come in and purchase that (74:33 - 74:39)
like the pricing was unbelievable (74:35 - 74:42)
and we had specialists in store (74:39 - 74:44)
that would know how to like if somebody (74:42 - 74:46)
came to me with a sports question i was (74:44 - 74:47)
like okay you have to go talk to this (74:46 - 74:48)
person (74:47 - 74:50)
because they have to do all the things (74:48 - 74:51)
to get you this card and talk to you (74:50 - 74:53)
about this card and talk to you about (74:51 - 74:54)
the mint (74:53 - 74:55)
and all of the stuff that goes around (74:54 - 74:58)
rating these cards is there like (74:55 - 75:03)
ultra rares and reverse holos and like (74:58 - 75:05)
do people do people like the whole like (75:03 - 75:07)
i want the whole set of series (75:05 - 75:10)
two i mean there were people who wanted (75:07 - 75:11)
whole sets of series (75:10 - 75:13)
i i know that they were sometimes (75:11 - 75:15)
special print cards (75:13 - 75:18)
i think hollow cards and that were (75:15 - 75:18)
really (75:18 - 75:22)
part of the game like (75:18 - 75:24)
card game things i again it's been a (75:22 - 75:26)
long time since i hadn't been around (75:24 - 75:26)
sports cards (75:26 - 75:28)
they may have introduced this to sports (75:26 - 75:30)
cards i highly doubt it because it never (75:28 - 75:32)
needed it (75:30 - 75:33)
uh but they were special they were (75:32 - 75:35)
definitely rare cards like they were (75:33 - 75:36)
definitely (75:35 - 75:38)
you know and there were definitely (75:36 - 75:40)
people i was like i have been searching (75:38 - 75:40)
for (75:40 - 75:42)
every card of every player that was a (75:40 - 75:43)
part of (75:42 - 75:46)
this sports team at this time period so (75:43 - 75:48)
they wanted a card for all the players (75:46 - 75:50)
that played in (75:48 - 75:53)
1968 and so they would travel the world (75:50 - 75:56)
trying to find to complete their team (75:53 - 75:56)
yeah but (75:56 - 75:58)
the point is the player right not the (75:56 - 76:00)
production of the card (75:58 - 76:01)
right or the rarity of the car it's just (76:00 - 76:03)
like that player (76:01 - 76:05)
that they want to have the card for that (76:03 - 76:06)
player um (76:05 - 76:09)
so the this target in in brookfield uh (76:06 - 76:12)
is is a very nice target it is a target (76:09 - 76:13)
where (76:12 - 76:16)
they you ever you ever been to a target (76:13 - 76:17)
and you can tell (76:16 - 76:20)
how good the target (76:17 - 76:23)
is or how bad the target is based on how (76:20 - 76:25)
much is on clearance (76:23 - 76:26)
have you ever noticed that like the bad (76:25 - 76:29)
targets have so much on clearance and (76:26 - 76:29)
the good (76:29 - 76:31)
targets that are like always very clean (76:29 - 76:32)

like their clearance section is like (76:32 - 76:36)

section at target yeah there can be (76:38 - 76:42)
this target never has clearance this (76:40 - 76:44)

very uh up uppity (77:08 - 77:13)
city it is an upscale target in an (77:10 - 77:14)
upscale (77:13 - 77:17)
market brookfield is a is a high (77:14 - 77:19)
corporate (77:17 - 77:21)
area i have to stay there when i go (77:19 - 77:23)
there for work (77:21 - 77:26)
um (77:23 - 77:26)
um i i can't say that i'm bummed that (77:26 - 77:30)
they're pulling cards because (77:29 - 77:32)
i cannot even remember the last time i (77:30 - 77:33)
got cards at target (77:32 - 77:36)
like their shelves are just empty (77:33 - 77:37)
consistently (77:36 - 77:40)
my go-to wait i remember the last time (77:37 - 77:41)
you got (77:40 - 77:42)
cards at target because you put it on (77:41 - 77:44)
instagram it was like three days ago (77:42 - 77:46)
yeah it was yesterday no it was on (77:44 - 77:48)
friday it was the day after the gun (77:46 - 77:49)
incident (77:48 - 77:51)
i went into that target they had a bunch (77:49 - 77:52)
of the gallerian (77:51 - 77:55)
ponytas it was pretty and all of them (77:52 - 77:57)
had stickers that said do not back stock (77:55 - 77:58)
so i think at that point (77:57 - 78:02)
i actually grabbed two gallerian ponytas (77:58 - 78:03)
they had six of them (78:02 - 78:04)
i grabbed two they had a bunch of (78:03 - 78:06)
booster packs for battle styles and then (78:04 - 78:07)
when i went to checkout (78:06 - 78:09)
it yelled at me and then the lady was (78:07 - 78:11)
like you can only get one (78:09 - 78:12)
and i was like oh that's weird because (78:11 - 78:15)
literally two days ago your rules said (78:12 - 78:18)
limit three but the register was smart (78:15 - 78:20)
enough to know that it was more than one (78:18 - 78:22)
so anyways i got one gallerian ponytail (78:20 - 78:24)
it was my last purchase at target but (78:22 - 78:26)
i'm assuming they just pulled everything (78:24 - 78:28)
forward and they just said (78:26 - 78:31)
one per person buy it we don't want it (78:28 - 78:32)
anymore don't back stock don't keep (78:31 - 78:34)
these in the back (78:32 - 78:37)
i think it's sad for the game like there (78:34 - 78:39)
are a lot of (78:37 - 78:42)
families that go to target and like it (78:39 - 78:43)
was an easy (78:42 - 78:46)
vector for pokemon to get cards in (78:43 - 78:47)
family's hands (78:46 - 78:50)
i think that i think the current sort of (78:47 - 78:52)
climate that we're in now (78:50 - 78:55)
is just it's a harmful client and (78:52 - 78:57)
ultimately harmful to the tcg (78:55 - 78:59)
and things like this pulling it out of a (78:57 - 79:01)
very common (78:59 - 79:04)
big box store is (79:01 - 79:08)
it's not a great look for (79:04 - 79:11)
for the tcg well i mean yes (79:08 - 79:15)
definitely but also right the concept (79:11 - 79:18)
the reason why they have the cards at (79:15 - 79:19)
target (79:18 - 79:21)
and why they are situated where they are (79:19 - 79:23)
situated in target (79:21 - 79:26)
is so that parents can take their kid to (79:23 - 79:26)
target and say (79:26 - 79:29)
all right if you're good i'll get you a (79:26 - 79:31)
pack of cards pack cards (79:29 - 79:36)
at the end i mean like (79:31 - 79:38)
most targets at least the milwaukee (79:36 - 79:40)
targets maybe i'm (79:38 - 79:44)
maybe i'm speaking poorly here but (79:40 - 79:46)
most targets didn't have any stock they (79:44 - 79:47)
they purposely saved it all for the (79:46 - 79:48)
friday mornings (79:47 - 79:51)
um so it wasn't it wasn't in ever since (79:48 - 79:52)
like november (79:51 - 79:54)
uh there wasn't ever the parent impulse (79:52 - 79:56)
buy of like let's get you (79:54 - 79:57)
a pack of vivid voltage because i can't (79:56 - 79:59)
even remember seeing booster packs of (79:57 - 80:00)
vivid voltage i will (79:59 - 80:03)
say at the target i went to today (80:00 - 80:07)
um they did have the big size (80:03 - 80:07)
the pikachu yeah the pikachu (80:08 - 80:14)
yeah um my go-to place has still been (80:11 - 80:16)
barnes noble (80:14 - 80:18)
uh i don't know if scalpers don't know (80:16 - 80:20)
this i feel like they probably do would (80:18 - 80:21)
you stop giving it away (80:20 - 80:25)
i know i see through barnes and noble (80:21 - 80:26)
yesterday (80:25 - 80:28)
they had six etbs on the shelf for (80:26 - 80:29)
battle styles (80:28 - 80:32)
they had all of the theme decks they had (80:29 - 80:34)
they had champions path i was like oh i (80:32 - 80:34)
don't want (80:34 - 80:37)
i don't need any more champions path um (80:34 - 80:37)
and (80:37 - 80:40)
consistently i would say four out of (80:37 - 80:42)
five times i go to barnes noble they (80:40 - 80:42)
have (80:42 - 80:46)
carts at msrp um (80:42 - 80:47)
and i bet they wouldn't have cards if (80:46 - 80:49)
they sold baseball cards next to those (80:47 - 80:52)
pokemon cards (80:49 - 80:54)
so again i'm not saying that like (80:52 - 80:56)
baseball cards are 100 ruining pokemon (80:54 - 80:58)
cards but (80:56 - 81:00)
again i think a lot of these news media (80:58 - 81:04)
outlets are overlooking the fact that (81:00 - 81:06)
the scalpers want baseball cards and if (81:04 - 81:07)
they can't get them (81:06 - 81:08)
they buy the pokemon cards yeah that's (81:07 - 81:11)
just less fun though in general people (81:08 - 81:13)
don't like knocking on sports the way (81:11 - 81:13)
they like (81:13 - 81:16)
knocking on nerd things (81:13 - 81:16)
right like like buying buying sports (81:17 - 81:21)
memorabilia (81:20 - 81:24)
has always been seen as more legitimate (81:21 - 81:27)
than buying video games (81:24 - 81:30)
so the headline that's going to get (81:27 - 81:33)
views and clicks is ragging on the video (81:30 - 81:34)
game (81:33 - 81:37)
absolutely absolutely babe ruth over (81:34 - 81:40)
pikachu charizard yeah but let's get (81:37 - 81:40)
babe ruth (81:40 - 81:45)

even imagine why is nobody putting this (83:33 - 83:37)
person in jail (83:36 - 83:40)
they are still clearly a villain they (83:37 - 83:41)
are clearly (83:40 - 83:43)
not repentant about anything they've (83:41 - 83:44)
done in the past (83:43 - 83:46)
and have said they're going to continue (83:44 - 83:48)
to be evil going into the future (83:46 - 83:50)

villain run (84:03 - 84:07)
their like champion club or whatever (84:04 - 84:09)

about the (84:09 - 84:15)
the leader of pasio island and their (84:12 - 84:16)
connection to team (84:15 - 84:19)
break or no connection to team break i'm (84:16 - 84:19)
not gonna (84:19 - 84:23)
spoil it okay fair enough (84:19 - 84:23)
i i feel like this is a problem that i (84:25 - 84:31)
have i don't know if you guys can relate (84:28 - 84:33)
like i remember the last time i played (84:31 - 84:35)
clash royale (84:33 - 84:38)
it was when sword and shield came out (84:35 - 84:41)
like when a new big game comes out and i (84:38 - 84:43)
get addicted to it it (84:41 - 84:46)
cuts off a game that i would have (84:43 - 84:48)
previously been addicted to well i'm not (84:46 - 84:50)
saying i'm not coming back to masters (84:48 - 84:53)
but the hard cutoff was the day pokemon (84:50 - 84:54)
snap came out (84:53 - 84:56)
like they're like my brain can only (84:54 - 84:58)
juggle so many games at the time (84:56 - 85:00)
why do you think my animal crossing (84:58 - 85:01)
village was abandoned (85:00 - 85:04)
oh never to be seen again yeah (85:01 - 85:07)
they they were left to their own they (85:04 - 85:09)

day (85:22 - 85:25)
well yeah because i'm not a game gobbler (85:23 - 85:26)
and i take things (85:25 - 85:30)
very very slowly (85:26 - 85:32)
i did i did walk away from animal (85:30 - 85:34)
crossing because it became (85:32 - 85:38)
animal chores yes right and uh i mean i (85:34 - 85:38)
was (85:38 - 85:41)
also watching a video where this person (85:38 - 85:41)
i know (85:41 - 85:44)
had basically dug like a thousand holes (85:41 - 85:46)
on their island so that they could make (85:44 - 85:48)
rocks show up in just like one (85:46 - 85:50)
particular location and i was like (85:48 - 85:54)
no no this is not this is the opposite (85:50 - 85:55)
of fun now (85:54 - 85:58)
i don't know i thought it was otherwise (85:55 - 85:59)
that was fun for while i was playing (85:58 - 86:00)
animal crossing (85:59 - 86:04)
uh mobile games for me are (86:00 - 86:07)

website like i no no one can steer scans (91:41 - 91:49)
but that i know of where do the scans go (91:44 - 91:50)
they go i'm assuming they go right to (91:49 - 91:52)
niantic they don't like you when you (91:50 - 91:53)
scan (91:52 - 91:58)
like a a religious statue at a cemetery (91:53 - 92:00)
like no one is seeing like that data (91:58 - 92:02)
from your phone isn't going to (92:00 - 92:04)
um what's it called what is that thing (92:02 - 92:06)
called the (92:04 - 92:09)
the wayfinder wayfinder yeah it's not (92:06 - 92:10)
going directly to wayfinder like that (92:09 - 92:11)
information (92:10 - 92:15)
up there not directly but indirectly (92:11 - 92:16)
because they have (92:15 - 92:18)
they have the kill the pokestops team (92:16 - 92:19)
look i have a friend (92:18 - 92:22)
locally who wants to destroy pokemon (92:19 - 92:23)
stops (92:22 - 92:25)
because things don't exist there anymore (92:23 - 92:27)
and i am fighting that (92:25 - 92:30)
i am fighting them by not scanning (92:27 - 92:31)
things that aren't there anymore so that (92:30 - 92:31)
means (92:31 - 92:34)
there is no way that there aren't (92:31 - 92:35)
thousands of people (92:34 - 92:38)
doing the scans every day that's (92:35 - 92:40)
so much data going back to niantic i'm (92:38 - 92:41)
sure they're using it for something but (92:40 - 92:42)
i don't think (92:41 - 92:44)
like they're there's somebody at the the (92:42 - 92:46)
checklist being like next awesome (92:44 - 92:48)
okay wait wait wait have you ever tried (92:46 - 92:50)
listening to my cell phone calls (92:48 - 92:53)
to log in to something on a web browser (92:50 - 92:55)
and it comes up and it says look at this (92:53 - 92:58)
grid of nine pictures (92:55 - 93:00)
which one is the post office that used (92:58 - 93:02)
to go greg used to go to (93:00 - 93:05)
and you have to click it right you've (93:02 - 93:06)
done this yeah (93:05 - 93:09)
because guess what those pictures (93:06 - 93:12)
come from mr google who owns (93:09 - 93:15)
mr niantic that's true is is (93:12 - 93:18)
this function the scan function is this (93:15 - 93:19)
an ingress (93:18 - 93:21)
i think it has to be an ingress right oh (93:19 - 93:22)
i have no idea (93:21 - 93:24)
like i would assume ingress players are (93:22 - 93:28)
also scanning whatever (93:24 - 93:28)
i mean i've submitted pokestops that (93:28 - 93:32)
have gotten approved (93:30 - 93:34)
but they never showed up but they show (93:32 - 93:35)
up in ingress (93:34 - 93:37)
but they do say that on wayfinder they (93:35 - 93:38)
say like (93:37 - 93:41)
we don't use pokestops for every game (93:38 - 93:43)
i've also had it where (93:41 - 93:45)
gyms turn into pokestops and then (93:43 - 93:47)
pokestops (93:45 - 93:50)
turn into gyms yes where they randomly (93:47 - 93:51)
like flip that switch (93:50 - 93:54)
all i'm saying is i am not giving big (93:51 - 93:55)
brother niantic (93:54 - 93:57)
any ammunition to close down my stops by (93:55 - 93:58)
doing their (93:57 - 94:01)
i will only are scared things that i (93:58 - 94:02)
know (94:01 - 94:06)
that the entire city of minneapolis is (94:02 - 94:06)
also (94:06 - 94:09)
not ar scanning that or pokestop yes (94:06 - 94:11)
we have all we all have an agreement (94:09 - 94:13)
except for one person and i know them (94:11 - 94:15)
personally who's trying to ruin (94:13 - 94:18)
everybody's fun not unless you live in (94:15 - 94:20)
some town of 200 people where you got (94:18 - 94:21)
three pokestops (94:20 - 94:24)
has the whole city agreed let's not (94:21 - 94:27)
ar skin you don't know our facebooks you (94:24 - 94:28)
don't know our discords you don't know (94:27 - 94:30)
how we talk (94:28 - 94:31)
everybody assumes everybody in (94:30 - 94:33)
minneapolis knows each other and that (94:31 - 94:35)
isn't a correct assessment (94:33 - 94:37)
we have all agreed except for one person (94:35 - 94:38)
who's like i'm gonna (94:37 - 94:40)
i'm gonna kill that stop because it's (94:38 - 94:42)
not there anymore sylveon will be making (94:40 - 94:44)
its pokemon go debut (94:42 - 94:48)
uh it will evolve into evie (94:44 - 94:52)
what wow that's some magic (94:48 - 94:53)
they got it backward i think out of (94:52 - 94:55)
backwards evolve evie into sylveon by (94:53 - 94:57)
earning hearts when it's your buddy (94:55 - 95:00)

items will be added to the shop (95:35 - 95:39)
okay that's it that's that's your (95:37 - 95:42)
pokemon go news (95:39 - 95:43)
greg do you want to do question of the (95:42 - 95:46)
week sure (95:43 - 95:46)
okay dearest pj ask away (95:47 - 95:54)
i can't wait to hear what you will pick (95:51 - 95:58)
for the question of the week (95:54 - 95:59)
was that a cover of katy perry's (95:58 - 96:01)
electric no because i don't know what (95:59 - 96:02)
that song sounds like (96:01 - 96:06)
all i know is it goes electric (96:02 - 96:06)
[Music] (96:06 - 96:12)
you laughing at you know that's gonna be (96:08 - 96:13)
a thing (96:12 - 96:16)
uh this is a question from jorts do you (96:13 - 96:17)
think pokemon would benefit from adding (96:16 - 96:18)
in (96:17 - 96:21)
players choice with those choices having (96:18 - 96:21)
an (96:21 - 96:25)
actual impact on game uh progression (96:21 - 96:29)
i am assuming this is like (96:25 - 96:32)
a mass effects or a dragon age where (96:29 - 96:35)
you have a dialogue tree and then you (96:32 - 96:36)
pick those things (96:35 - 96:39)
and it leads you down a branching path (96:36 - 96:40)
they already do this though (96:39 - 96:43)
helix fossil or dome make your choice (96:40 - 96:45)
and move on (96:43 - 96:49)
no big no stop why do you exist (96:45 - 96:52)
uh do do i think it would (96:49 - 96:55)
benefit from it (96:52 - 96:57)
[Music] (96:55 - 97:00)
maybe like they would have to have a (96:57 - 97:02)
much more complex story and i don't (97:00 - 97:03)
think they're going to do that (97:02 - 97:06)
so do i think do i think implementing (97:03 - 97:08)
this to get a much more complex story (97:06 - 97:10)
would benefit pokemon (97:08 - 97:15)
yes um but they would need to (97:10 - 97:18)
have much better stories i think that (97:15 - 97:22)
that is a (97:18 - 97:22)
there is a a non-linear aspect of having (97:22 - 97:27)
branching pathways that (97:26 - 97:31)
is hard it's already (97:27 - 97:34)
not easily accessed by a lot of people (97:31 - 97:35)
like that (97:34 - 97:36)
there are always people who are going to (97:35 - 97:38)
want an optimized sort of (97:36 - 97:42)
experience and a lot of choices things (97:38 - 97:42)
are leading to (97:42 - 97:45)
like this is the best best this is the (97:42 - 97:47)
not best this is oh you min maxing (97:45 - 97:50)
yeah and so in in a game that (97:47 - 97:52)
really does lean into min maxing in a (97:50 - 97:53)
lot of ways (97:52 - 97:56)
or overpowering i think i think it's a (97:53 - 97:57)
tough (97:56 - 98:01)
fit i think i think it would be a better (97:57 - 98:04)
fit for a game like coliseum (98:01 - 98:08)
or uh gale of darkness (98:04 - 98:11)
where there is where it's a that's a (98:08 - 98:12)
very story driven (98:11 - 98:16)
sort of hey you are fighting this team (98:12 - 98:18)
do you rescue this do you stop this (98:16 - 98:19)
person do you do that where (98:18 - 98:22)
you know you already have a small pool (98:19 - 98:23)
of things you can (98:22 - 98:25)
collect i think that fits better with (98:23 - 98:26)
that than (98:25 - 98:31)
the main large collecting game (98:26 - 98:35)
yeah i already i i don't want to say i (98:31 - 98:35)
hate (98:35 - 98:37)
i don't love it i don't hate it but when (98:35 - 98:39)
when they do do things like dome or (98:37 - 98:41)
helix which eevee do you want um (98:39 - 98:45)
which hershey food do you want like (98:41 - 98:48)
i want everything yeah and so when you (98:45 - 98:49)
start giving me like (98:48 - 98:51)
choices especially like oh if i do this (98:49 - 98:53)
this is going to change that (98:51 - 98:56)
point of the game like now i'm i could (98:53 - 98:57)
feel like i'm frustrated that nah i (98:56 - 98:58)
gotta play it again (98:57 - 98:59)
if i want to see that choice or i gotta (98:58 - 99:01)
look it up or yes like (98:59 - 99:02)
with the hershey food thing i had to (99:01 - 99:04)
play twice because i wanted both hershey (99:02 - 99:04)
foods well (99:04 - 99:06)
that's the thing it's like i think (99:04 - 99:08)
they've hit the limit of (99:06 - 99:10)
of a branching path concept number one (99:08 - 99:12)
by fundamentally making (99:10 - 99:14)
you have to choose are you going to do (99:12 - 99:15)
this game that has these version (99:14 - 99:17)
exclusives or this game that has these (99:15 - 99:18)
version exclusives (99:17 - 99:21)
and anything more that they do within (99:18 - 99:22)
that (99:21 - 99:24)
that would limit you to getting one (99:22 - 99:26)
pokemon or another pokemon (99:24 - 99:29)
which let's be honest would be the whole (99:26 - 99:31)
point of having branching paths in a (99:29 - 99:33)
pokemon game right (99:31 - 99:34)
uh like one would lead you to one (99:33 - 99:36)
legendary and one with legion yeah (99:34 - 99:38)
exactly that would create problems in (99:36 - 99:40)
the community in a maine (99:38 - 99:42)
series the more and it's like it would (99:40 - 99:43)
it would literally just inspire people (99:42 - 99:45)
to hack more (99:43 - 99:46)
they already did that though you want (99:45 - 99:48)
one you want this horse or you want that (99:46 - 99:49)
horse (99:48 - 99:51)
yeah but that's version exclusivity (99:49 - 99:53)
because i just have it like on both my (99:51 - 99:54)
versions and (99:53 - 99:56)
in my sword version i got ice horse and (99:54 - 99:57)
in right (99:56 - 99:58)
version i get ghost tours i think (99:57 - 100:00)
they've done as much as (99:58 - 100:04)
the game and the community can handle uh (100:00 - 100:07)
i think if if they leaned into it more (100:04 - 100:08)
in a main series game i think it would (100:07 - 100:09)
overall hurt (100:08 - 100:11)
i think it would hurt the game more if (100:09 - 100:14)
they did something where (100:11 - 100:17)
i feel like a pokemon game did this if (100:14 - 100:17)
if they (100:17 - 100:21)
i i still dislike the consequence of (100:17 - 100:25)
losing in a pokemon game (100:21 - 100:27)
because all it does is it takes your (100:25 - 100:28)
money (100:27 - 100:32)
and then that puts you at a disadvantage (100:28 - 100:35)
because you can't then use you're losing (100:32 - 100:35)
money (100:35 - 100:37)
where like let's say let's say you went (100:35 - 100:38)
through a battle this is a very common (100:37 - 100:39)
thing (100:38 - 100:40)
probably with a younger audience maybe (100:39 - 100:42)
like eight or ten years old (100:40 - 100:43)
especially me as a kid because i was (100:42 - 100:45)
dumb but you know you're (100:43 - 100:47)
you're in a battle with the elite four (100:45 - 100:49)
and you use all your potions (100:47 - 100:52)
use all your revives during the battle (100:49 - 100:53)
you make it all the way to (100:52 - 100:56)
lance let's just do red and blue (100:53 - 100:59)
and then you lose the lance and he takes (100:56 - 101:00)
your money (100:59 - 101:04)
now you have less money (101:00 - 101:06)
and you have no more hyper potions you (101:04 - 101:08)
have no more super potions you have no (101:06 - 101:09)
revives because you used them all and (101:08 - 101:12)
you lost and (101:09 - 101:14)
now it feels like it's this uphill (101:12 - 101:15)
battle (101:14 - 101:18)
because either you if if you don't (101:15 - 101:19)
buy anything because you don't have (101:18 - 101:21)
enough money and you go through again (101:19 - 101:23)
you don't have those potions you don't (101:21 - 101:24)
have those revives you lose again and (101:23 - 101:26)
they take even more money (101:24 - 101:29)
so your actual and it's not like in (101:26 - 101:31)
in those older pokemon games at least (101:29 - 101:32)
there's ways to make money (101:31 - 101:33)
like if you battled all the trainers if (101:32 - 101:36)
you found all the nuggets like you don't (101:33 - 101:37)
have (101:36 - 101:40)
income so um your best option (101:37 - 101:43)
is to at least in my opinion is to (101:40 - 101:47)
buy as much as you can buy don't use any (101:43 - 101:47)
of it (101:47 - 101:49)
go through the elite four let them (101:47 - 101:51)
defeat you and then (101:49 - 101:54)
use whatever remaining money you have (101:51 - 101:54)
and (101:54 - 101:56)
buy again and then at a certain point (101:54 - 101:57)
where you think you're going to (101:56 - 102:00)
win the run then you use those potions (101:57 - 102:01)
and those (102:00 - 102:03)
but the game it's such a weird mechanic (102:01 - 102:05)
to be like oh well we're taking money (102:03 - 102:06)
from you (102:05 - 102:08)
instead and maybe this goes back to (102:06 - 102:10)
george questions adding players choice (102:08 - 102:15)
like if trainers change their pokemon (102:10 - 102:18)
based on whether you won or lost or how (102:15 - 102:19)
good you did (102:18 - 102:20)
i think that would be more exciting i (102:19 - 102:21)
don't know if that ties into the (102:20 - 102:22)
question like (102:21 - 102:25)
um instead of like when you get to your (102:22 - 102:26)
rival (102:25 - 102:27)
like the first rival battle you're (102:26 - 102:29)
allowed to lose right like the game (102:27 - 102:31)
doesn't black you out (102:29 - 102:34)
you don't like it it continues on (102:31 - 102:37)
i would if if you if you beat that rival (102:34 - 102:40)
he should have stronger pokemon and if (102:37 - 102:41)
you lose that rival (102:40 - 102:45)
um maybe his pokemon get weaker and or (102:41 - 102:47)
like if or the other way around to get (102:45 - 102:49)
the challenge to balance right (102:47 - 102:52)
yeah so that's not really player choice (102:49 - 102:53)
though that's not a choice the player's (102:52 - 102:55)
making that's true yeah that's that is (102:53 - 102:58)
that is a that is a a consequence (102:55 - 103:02)
of in-game activity which (102:58 - 103:04)
i think is good but it is a different (103:02 - 103:06)
than i've made a choice to go down this (103:04 - 103:08)
path i've made a choice to lose to this (103:06 - 103:11)
guy i made a choice to lose to lance (103:08 - 103:12)
yeah that's true that's not player's (103:11 - 103:16)
choice um (103:12 - 103:16)
it's an interesting thing to think about (103:16 - 103:20)
yeah i think i think (103:18 - 103:23)
depending on (103:20 - 103:23)
where they go with the series i i would (103:23 - 103:26)
love to see (103:25 - 103:30)
more just pure (103:26 - 103:32)
role-playing games that have a limited (103:30 - 103:35)
pool of pokemon that you can get (103:32 - 103:38)
that would have branching paths like you (103:35 - 103:39)
know going into it this (103:38 - 103:42)
isn't a collecting game this is you know (103:39 - 103:45)
this is the story uh like caleb darkness (103:42 - 103:46)
was to some extent (103:45 - 103:49)
um and i think they should add more in (103:46 - 103:51)
there i think for the main series that (103:49 - 103:52)
is much more about collecting they (103:51 - 103:55)
have reached the limit of is it this or (103:52 - 103:55)
this (103:55 - 103:56)
are you gonna pick one of these three (103:55 - 103:59)
starters like i think (103:56 - 104:01)
i think they've reached what the (103:59 - 104:03)
community can can tolerate (104:01 - 104:04)
i think i think that could be pokemon (104:03 - 104:08)
legends yeah it could be no definitely (104:04 - 104:09)
i think i think that would be an (104:08 - 104:10)
opportunity for something like that (104:09 - 104:11)
that's more (104:10 - 104:15)
like skyrim than (104:11 - 104:18)
say a traditional pokemon game right (104:15 - 104:20)
well what is our pokemon of the week (104:18 - 104:23)
well what was our pokemon of the week (104:20 - 104:24)
last week folks (104:23 - 104:29)
it uh started out that it wasn't ihop (104:24 - 104:31)
number one so you had to think of the (104:29 - 104:33)
other one and if you were thinking (104:31 - 104:35)
huddle house please there's like six (104:33 - 104:37)
huddle houses in the entire united (104:35 - 104:37)
states (104:37 - 104:40)
obviously not what i what is the other (104:37 - 104:42)
one (104:40 - 104:45)
greg what are you (104:42 - 104:49)
serious answer for the people steve (104:45 - 104:51)
if it's not ihop what is it what's the (104:49 - 104:53)
other one pancake house (104:51 - 104:55)
why do you die not original pancake (104:53 - 104:57)
house (104:55 - 105:00)
waffle house waffle house (104:57 - 105:03)
waffle house is we i'm pretty certain i (105:00 - 105:05)
have been to a waffle house with you in (105:03 - 105:08)
indianapolis yes but not wisconsin (105:05 - 105:14)
no still it's no (105:08 - 105:14)
look all of this is irrelevant (105:14 - 105:21)
it's not fact it's highly relevant that (105:17 - 105:25)
it's waffle house and (105:21 - 105:27)
then you have to take the word waffle (105:25 - 105:29)
and make all those adjustments to the (105:27 - 105:30)
letters that i (105:29 - 105:33)
indicated where you replace the f's with (105:30 - 105:34)
p's (105:33 - 105:38)
and you get apple and then you also (105:34 - 105:41)
have to recognize that the letter (105:38 - 105:45)
which in english is w but in most other (105:41 - 105:45)
languages (105:45 - 105:48)
is double v uh which (105:45 - 105:50)
then i said is a double letter so (105:48 - 105:52)
replace it with two letters (105:50 - 105:54)
those two letters one being the f that (105:52 - 105:55)
you replaced with the p (105:54 - 105:58)
previously and the l that is at the l (105:55 - 106:02)
e end of the word and you get (105:58 - 106:02)
it's guava fat (106:03 - 106:10)
ooh wobble fat house wobba fat is not (106:06 - 106:11)
fruit based (106:10 - 106:14)
it's flapple (106:11 - 106:18)
flapple yes which i also (106:14 - 106:21)
believe mentioned like the week prior (106:18 - 106:21)
like (106:21 - 106:27)
have i ever done flapples (106:21 - 106:30)
appleton wisconsin there is trivia on (106:27 - 106:31)
flapple yeah there's (106:30 - 106:33)
oh nobody goes to appleton mm-hmm yeah (106:31 - 106:35)
appleton's (106:33 - 106:36)
love i only know what apple thing is (106:35 - 106:38)
that friend of mine grew up there (106:36 - 106:40)
i only know appleton because there's a (106:38 - 106:42)
youtube video of a person complaining (106:40 - 106:43)
about (106:42 - 106:45)
the candles that she purchased from bed (106:43 - 106:46)
bath and beyond (106:45 - 106:48)
and it's about a half hour video uh just (106:46 - 106:50)
so we all know there is no shuffle icon (106:48 - 106:52)
and it breaks my heart (106:50 - 106:54)
flapple and appleton are the only (106:52 - 106:56)
pokemon to have identical (106:54 - 106:58)
gigantomax forms although they are still (106:56 - 107:00)
treated as different pokemon and have (106:58 - 107:03)
um distinct pokedex entry gmax moves and (107:00 - 107:04)
cries (107:03 - 107:06)
this is also the only instance of two (107:04 - 107:08)
different species of pokemon that can (107:06 - 107:11)
uh that can be physically uh (107:08 - 107:14)
identical without the use of transform (107:11 - 107:16)
imposter or illusion (107:14 - 107:18)
flapland its evolutionary family are the (107:16 - 107:21)
only ones in the grass and dragon type (107:18 - 107:23)
egg group (107:21 - 107:25)
even though flapple's pokedex entry (107:23 - 107:27)
refers to spitting acid (107:25 - 107:31)
it cannot learn apple acid (107:27 - 107:31)
called apple acid (107:31 - 107:34)
only apple 10 can learn apple acid (107:34 - 107:42)
what does it do it is an 80 power move (107:38 - 107:43)
100 (107:42 - 107:46)
accuracy it's a special grass and it (107:43 - 107:48)
will lower the special defenses (107:46 - 107:51)
stacked by one stage target's special (107:48 - 107:52)

set to my cute little rose (107:52 - 107:56)
well i can't learn it only apple (107:55 - 108:00)
tinkling yeah at this time (107:56 - 108:01)
yeah of course every signature every (108:00 - 108:05)
singer's your move gets spread out (108:01 - 108:07)
you know flapple might be a combination (108:05 - 108:08)
of flap and apple whoa (108:07 - 108:13)
what or flying apple possibly (108:08 - 108:16)
