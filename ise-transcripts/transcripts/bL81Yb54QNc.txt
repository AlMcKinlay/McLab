[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 461st episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj uh we got a loaded show for you guys uh yeah we got news we got news there's looks on greg's and will's face nobody informed me i was going to coast through this greg is here ready to coast i am a look i'm on vacation okay i don't work this next week i am floating through my time here until i have to face the realities of going back to work in seven days hey that's uh decent yeah i mean i don't work my birthday week so this is my advice to everybody take your birthday week off the entire week the entire week oh give yourself the gift of doing whatever you want too late this year uh will also hear not your birthday week it is certainly not uh but i do have an important uh what is the correct term for uh something that is both an announcement and a scold uh guten announcement no that's like i don't know either way listeners dearest listeners and that's please take that with as much sarcasm as possible if you are a pokemon go player and it is pokemon go community day and you are online now here's the important part listen if greg or will invites you to a raid you show up you use that remote raid pass and you raid with us don't you ignore our invitations yeah you didn't invite me you you were not online i didn't get online i only did an hour clean it okay then get out of my school you're not in this conversation you weren't online there was no green dot next to your name we would have invited you alex gets points alex yes catherine gets catherine gets points but there were a few others that did answer the qual but there were we failed a mega loaf honey because none of y'all showed up yes i would have done mega lopan well you weren't there we can't rely on you you sleep all the time do you know what the better tell is whether they're going to join your right or not what it's when they have the mega symbol next their name as well as the green dot alex did have the mega symbol next to his name the mega symbol is the ultimate like they are ready to jump because they got that uh hopefully they got that like next to them nobody has the mega hound going credit to actual shooby i can't remember actual shoe b's real name but actual shoe b showed up yeah for one congrats thank you we'll actually start off the show with something helpful i don't know if people know this or not something helpful show up for my daggone raids when i invite you otherwise i will put you on the list the bad list you will go further down you will probably removed from my list of pokemon go friends i have plenty of people who want to be my pokemon go friends who would be willing to show up for raids when i invite them thank you so i i think a lot of people were not a lot maybe many people maybe many vocal people were a little bit bummed that suabloo was not double candy and double candy would have made sense for suavelu since it cost 400 to evolve swat blue into altaria and instead they did the double hatch distance this time around which i don't know maybe it was due for it i can't remember if there's like a pattern to like stardust xp hatch candy they've taught me not to not to look for patterns yeah maybe there's me so many times but um on these on these days where ideally you're supposed to play a lot of pokemon go because they're like a six-hour community day go have fun trainers here are your bonuses uh i don't know if people know this but when you mega evolve a pokemon if you mega evolve the pokemon of the type you're catching so in this case this weekend i mega evolved pidgeot because believe it or not swablu is not a dragon type it's a flying type um you get normal yeah you get like bonus energy slash whatever matching the type so if it was like squirtle you would want a mega evolved water pokemon if it was like charmander you want a mega evolve a hound doom or a charizard and i get bonus whats yeah bonus energy what are you talking about what is energy there's no energy in pokemon so like that's the tcg so you know how you need omega energy to mega evolve yes yes so for pidgeot you need once i think i think you need only a hundred mega energy to evolve it and then after you mega evolve it again it's only 20. so when you mega evolve it and then every flying type or normal type you catch you get mega energy back oh like a little refund so you have a cashback credit card you know so if you do one percent of the gas station two percent for flying three percent for normals makes sense like my chase points yeah yeah where i get all the points so you get um so by the time you catch 20 swablu you're you've paid for your mega or you could not mega and not pay and keep the money in the bank yes there you go if you if you catch 40 suavelu you double your energy you you've made it nobody is catching 40 swablu but wait here let's also repeat a conversation between will and greg yesterday yes hey greg yes i guess i have to evolve one of these uh shiny golden swab blues into an alteria so i could have a shiny alteria yes and will then evolves a shiny golden swablu into a golden alteria and i say oh look there's a button that says mega evolve the alteria but it needs 200 mega alteria whatevers triangles where do i get those it's not released yet no it was released it was released at the end of the radar okay you know i was working on the radar when the radar was over i lost interest then when the radar was over oh i'm sorry it's not right hour it was released at the end of the community day yeah the sensible one to three the two hours in the middle of the day we walked around the art park it was very lovely we had wonderful conversations there was friends everybody except catherine alex and other people that showed up for our raids i especially did i did god he got just raped so i wanted to do the megas so instead of doing an early community like you guys i did it near the end how is it one o'clock in the afternoon and drove the half hour up to greg's neighborhood that's you know there i went shopping i bought uh new pieces of furniture i bought a lamp i had lunch i met will at one this was my morning i didn't want to grasp twice i like to i like to sleep so my thought process was do it from three to five that's two hours and then at five the altaria starts popping and then i'm already out and i'm out and about uh turns knife delete at six turns out no this has been however many community days in a row that i've gone back to the park the park i used to go to pre-pandemic and this is like three or four and no one is out playing after like three it's like yeah people have lives yeah they don't want to play the whole six hours no um and or they just don't want to go to that park anymore i guess which i find hard to believe because that park is extremely popular that's why i go there you should have cut you should a live here b go to the air park with us there was plenty of people playing i i'm working on that so there's two ways there was two ways to get mega altar of candy this yesterday one was to do mega altaria raids the other was that some of the research the spin the pokestop stuff uh they had what do whatever to get candy that was the first time they did that and it seems like people were very excited about that like that um i didn't find a lot of those quests i mostly had like catch three and get like three ultra balls i didn't even pay attention i was so having a good time with my friend will greg and greg won community day i did because greg got the most shiny swab blues i like at one point only had one but back to the main topic here having having an altaria day where you have a pokemon that can mega evolve but you can't mega evolve it until the community day is over that's like getting a present on christmas and then the that says well but you can't actually play this until new year's day the batteries aren't released in time i was like please yeah just like don't even give me the the present okay because now i just hate you get it uh again it's it's it's like niantic hates money like but they don't they love money they don't they make a lot of it they love money but what what if you just do the raids during the raid hour why don't you boost the raids during they they have a button why didn't they just have the greg and i did raids with the occasional good people who showed up to do them with us yeah now steve sometimes they hit the wrong button and they turn off shinies or they turn off of paris and then whatever why don't they that says like triple the amount of rate this is not specific to altaria this is specific to every community today and i feel for those players who don't live in a big city i feel for those players who don't play every single day i feel for those players i respect those players let me change that word i respect those players that are not in a discord or in a facebook group because those people are out of their minds and they're they're doing the right trains and i don't want 800 pings about how a low punny popped some of these people they they play pokemon go heavily but they only play once a week and usually maybe that's a saturday maybe that's a community why does niantic just not boost the raids for community today there we you are telling all your players to play at the same time this weekend crank that raid button up just crank it then it should be non-stop parades doing giant three people recording right now only one of us has a personal relationship with mr john hanke the ceo of niantic and it's not me or greg so pick up the phone i know you made friends with him on that first pokemon go fest when you talked face to face just tell them john mr hanky whatever mr pokemon go please please crank up parades the races break the raids up or quit now fraud well i've said this before like there has been community days um where i did the whole three hours at elm grove park and the entire three hours this is before pandemic um there was only like two raids the entire three hours and there's like eight gyms at this park and that's that is frustrating of like i see all these people playing they're all incense they got the lures down everyone's having a good time you got little johnny across the sidewalk yelling that he got a shiny something and it's like it's so it would be so easy to jump in our raids uh you know what they did right kanto the kanto fest there was raid after raid after raid and it was sweet um and i kind of wish community days felt a little more like that i have to pay 12.99 for that experience though if they said hey for 12.99 you'll always have somebody to raid with and you'll never have to join a discord or a facebook group i'm in i'm 100 oh you don't have to join a discord or a facebook group uh okay you have to respond to the call when the call goes out when the pokemon go bat signal shows up and you have a green dot next to your name get thee to the raid pilgrim i i wanted to start off uh the show we got real sidetracked with community but that's fine it was pokemon related i wanted to start off the show talking about pokemon snap i don't know if i don't know if will played anymore i don't know if greg played anymore but i'm 56 hours in now i'm 56 hours in i highly agree it'll be a busy week i have played zero okay uh before i i have i have a good and a bad about pokemon snap but i will give me some more impressions what do you got here uh marlowe is really cute hey i got some good snaps of the more lulls and who else did i get it was like night time in the jungle my part light part is daytime light parts done we're diamond diamond diamond on life there's nothing new to learn there uh i got ya is it yanma or yon mega that is don megan i got it to look right at me it was it picked up an apple that had been floating in the water and was just chewing on it so nice and sweetly got that i'm still just i'm still having a good time but i'm also still playing each level about 30 times before i will move on to a new level uh did you make it past jungle no no all right you know you're getting your money's worth why why would i go past jungle when i still haven't finished park i still haven't finished meganium i still gotta do meganium like 15 more times okay so meganium is what i want to talk about uh i i want to be as i don't want to spoil some stuff but i am going to talk very specific about the meganium thing because there's a lot there that they don't show you on the surface um but but i have a complaint with the meganium stuff uh but before i get to the meganium stuff i want to talk about how pokemon snap is is really good at discovery we've talked about this prior but it's it's so good at it um and which is why the meganium stuff is frustrating so um again i'm not going to be spoiler here so there's there's a level where the the first pokemon snap did this let me lay the groundwork the first pokemon snap in the beach level there's there's a there's a lapras so you got you got your dodrio pops out your pidgeys pop out there's a pikachu you can kite him over to the surfboard he gets on the surfboard he starts dancing but if if you look in the background in the ocean there's a lapras and if you take a picture of the lapras um when you get to the scyther part which is right past the snorlax uh more laprases will appear it tr that picture of lapras triggers more lapras so when you get to past the snorlax you get more lapras if you take a picture of those when you cross the bridge you get another if you look back to the ocean you get another lapras you take a picture of that and then finally right before you get to kangaskhan you can get some incredible pictures of lapras because it comes really close to the bridge and the only way you do that is by taking pictures of lapras um and i think there's like one or two other instances in the 64 version where it does that they brought that mechanic back um and so uh but they don't use it a lot over with the whole scope of the game it's not used a lot but in one level there's a pokemon on top of a hill and if you take a picture of it it will then appear at a different hill and if you take a picture of it it will appear in front of you and if you take a picture of it it will open a secret path and the first time you open that secret path you're like holy cow that was awesome and the game is really the game doesn't tell you that like nowhere in the instruction manual the game is like well if y'all take a picture of the pokemon instruction manual there's no instruction manual there never has been and and i think for that i think most players will eventually have that happen without looking it up because eventually you'll probably be like i need a picture of that pokemon right eventually you're probably going to be like i want a better picture of that pokemon and if you if you're if you're setting out on your level to take a picture of that pokemon and you do it and then um it's not even like a six seven it's it's less than five seconds later they appear again you do it and then maybe three to four seconds later they appear again and you do it and then they open the secret path and then that secret path is permanently opened so the game is incredible at doing that and when you first go through that secret path you're like whoa i didn't know like this was here and there's new pokemon that you've never seen on that secret path and then another example is in a different level there's a there's a pokemon that is on a rock and it's one of the pokemon where if you hit him with an apple he falls off the rock and then something exciting super happens and you have no reason to throw an apple at this pokemon because it's a pokemon that appears in a bunch of other levels you probably already have good shots of that pokemon but when you knock them off the rock something really really cool happens and it's it's it blows your mind you're like this might be the coolest picture i've ever had um well if you respond fast enough to take a picture will anderson's biggest problem well the nice part about that one is it's at the start of the level uh so but this is something that you would probably eventually do because of all your tools hey have i tried the music on this pokemon have i tried an apple on this pokemon have i tried the illuminati ball have i tried the scan right you have four different items you can use and so the game does those two interactions are both done perfectly throughout the game you'll eventually discover them if you're trying to unlock the secrets yourself obviously you could skip everything i said just go directly to therapy look up every interaction and then move on with life but the but pokemon snap is very good at at kind of encouraging you to use all your tools and then we get to the meganium level and well it's not i know what you're talking about and i have a different level that i have this i had the same problem in and the the meganium level is relatively short it's way shorter than everything else meganium starts off in a different pose every time he has like three poses one he's lying down to the eevee's jumping on him hey don't that's a spoiler you're not supposed stop now uh so um if you start off that level and you do the scan you see meganium you you so you scan the area you see meganium you see eevee and then you see a sylveon off to the side and you can scan right away so right off the bat of the mechanium level you got meganium sylveon eevee and you gotta throw the illuminati ball meganium gets all powered up and then when meganium gets to the first uh crystal when you throw the illuminati ball you can get like a four star picture of sylveon and a four-star picture of evie because they're really excited and you can get some good shots of meganium so if if you do that first part all right if you get the silvion to come over if you get the eevee to follow if you get meganium to smell the crystal then shaymin will appear on the rock and they give you a very short window and they purposely put these trees in the way where you you have a short window of hitting shaman with illuminati ball and if you hit him with the illuminati ball he uh meganium will look over shaymin will jump on meganium's head and then he'll keep going and then that seems to be and when you do that sorry right before shaymin to comfay will come out of the tree uh to like signify that shaymin is active so you did the first part with evie sylveon meganium comfey comes out of the tree meaning you did it right shaymin appears you hit shaymin with the illuminati you got five pokemon and then um there's another crystal and if you hit that correctly meganium will run around the tree and then the level is over and that's the whole level and you have these tools so there are four more pokemon in this level which is the frustrating part because you have these tools and none of them work like the entire rest of the game works and it's incredibly frustrating more specifically the scan tool so um i i'm 56 hours in this was the first time i had to look it up because i was so frustrated with doing this level over and over and there's two right there there's two reasons i knew there was more pokemon on this level number one is professor mir says like oh you can get meganium to sit down. he wants a picture of meganium sitting on his butt he's like okay well i've done this level 30 times meganium's not sitting on his butt so i don't know what i'm supposed to do here and then number two is um i lost my thought for number two uh but oh number two is the leaderboard i had a score of eight hundred 000 for that level and somebody else had 1.8 million on that level and i was like how the heck did they get 1.8 million because i'm getting four diamonds four star diamonds on evie and shaymin and meganium how did they get so many points unless there's more pokemon in this level and so there are there are two pokemon hidden in that giant tree that meganium runs around and the scan feature the thing that is supposed to show you where pokemon are doesn't work on the tree and before anyone says well maybe the tree is too far sylveon is a yeah across the world feature works and shows you sylveon and so the scan feature doesn't show you there are pokemon in the tree and this then piggybacks off how bad the apple physics are so you ha and again the game doesn't tell you ever you need to do this nor i don't think there's another level where this happens and unless maybe they're specific to boss levels you have to lob apple after apple at the tree and then a bunch of comb bee will come out of the tree and then a hoot hoot will come out of the tree but because the apple physics are kind of bad you literally have to crank your camera as high as possible so you can't even see meganium you can't see the tree you're just throwing apples and hoping you hit the tree and then the combi come out and then the hoot hoot comes out but one your scan doesn't show you their pokemon in the tree two i can't think of anywhere else in the game where you're just randomly throwing apples at a non-pokemon for something to happen without the scan telling you something to happen and three even if you get the combi out of the tree but you fail to get them out fast enough the meganium will not sit down and so you miss that whole moment so even though you might look it up of like oh combi and hoot are in the tree i was only able to get meganium to sit down twice after doing this like 20 times and knowing that combi and hoot hoot are in the tree it's incredibly frustrating um and then on top of that after i did that level i did this level two hours straight to try to just get a high score there are two more pokemon in the level there's a pichu and an apom in this level and there is no way of knowing they're in the level without just knowing you're supposed to randomly throw apples at this part of the cliff because your scan doesn't tell you pokemon are in this level what why is this level built so poorly yeah no no no no no no no no no number one steve the tree is made out of either adamantium or vibranium the scan can't get into the wood that's that's why you can't see the point number two clearly you were born in the late 80s because literally what you just described was all video games from like 1972 1972-1990 no explanation figure it out hope your friends figure it out so they can tell you how to do it there is a game out there called jump man which was literally just like platforms and rings and so there were levels where it's just like how the frick am i supposed to get and then like it was bad bad days peter in the you know recess coming he's like i finally beat that level here's what you got to do you got to actually jump off the screen to the left and you actually reappear not on the normal right where you normally would but you drop down from the top and that's how you do it and number three it's not frustrating it's challenging it's the challenge this is the secret of of the new pokemon snap that you you just like are completely missing it is an homage to classic classic frustration classic video games this is battletoads2021 is what this is i had a very similar experience uh and this is my spoiler warning i had a very similar experience trying to do the mini r section of the desert night but the scan feature works on all the linear no it doesn't because there's there's one that happens immediately and the scan doesn't pick it up until you're well past it i have i until i looked it up i scanned and scanned and it shows one's off in the distance but there's one immediately at the start and it does not show up until you're away from it a distance from it and it's behind you i spent three hours i wonder if the scan is broken on that level now because there's a lot of adamantium and vibranium around it just like it bounces that's why i wanted that's why i want to start off with the two examples of how pokemon snap is really great like the the picture picture pic picture picture picture open secret path and uh try reminder just to try an apple on every pokemon a reminder to try music on every pokemon a reminder to try the scan on every pokemon it gives you reasons to go back to their levels and like hey i don't think i've ever played music in front of this pokemon hey i don't think i've ever thrown an apple on this pokemon's head like it gives you so many reasons to go back and the fact that like those tools don't seem to work like they normally work in the meganium level is incredibly frustrating i believe and even when you know the answer um it's you have such a short window to complete what you want to do and i think the mechanium level maybe gets a small pass because it's a shorter level but imagine like one of the longer levels like the ice level or the um the volcano level and all you're trying to do is get something at the very end of that level and you're like i gotta suffer through the first like two minutes of this level just because i want one good shot at the end the the windows for activation sometimes just seem so incredibly small that i feel like that is more of a hindrance than a benefit and i wish there was a stopping function let me stop yeah and i think like see you're asking them to make the game easier for you no no i just yeah that that meganium level is just bad and it it would it pushes more people away than it brings people that it continues letting people play because most people out there do the mechanium level and they do it enough times to get to the end of the game and they're like that's as much as that as you're right you're right i i am sure that most people probably only did the meganium level maybe three or four what say even more right how this is an homage to classic video games because they would always put like the most complicated one up at the front and you'd get past it and then you'd be like oh wait but i missed this and then you'd like find out later oh i missed this other thing you'd keep going back and doing those levels that were just like it seemed so simple at the beginning it's easy to grind out like jungle or park because even if you had a bad run or even if you missed the one picture you wanted to get you probably have other pictures that are better or you probably at least got a pose so like there is there's like ah i almost had it that time these three pictures are better let's run it again um but with the with the meganium one um one you don't need that a palmer that pichu to appear because you probably already have one two three four stars from other levels um and two like the only reason they would really you would really want them to appear is if you wanted like a course high score uh because again you could you could easily get a 4k pichu in um park in like the first level so so they they are hidden for the like the more hardcore but i just like why if the scam can see sylveon 18 miles away why can't the scan at least tell me like it doesn't need to tell me what pokemon are in the tree it doesn't tell me it doesn't need to tell me how many pokemon on the tree but why doesn't it just show like question mark question mark question mark i can be right next to a lady lydian lady in whatever that pokemon is called in the park in the in the jungle at night and i can be right next to it and see it and it'll be like question mark question mark question mark it's like i know what it is i know it's there i know that i need to do something to get it to come out of the tree but the fact that the the scan feature doesn't work like i still don't know exactly where the apom is in that level and i know you're supposed to throw apples to like kite him out but you want me to just go through the level over and over and just throw apples because i promise you you do that the minute that apom pokes its little apom head out you're gonna be yes hooray i fight how do you know i'm not without frustrating because i'm gonna because i'm gonna miss because i'm gonna miss an activation of that i would just like feel my soul just like expands through my body i'm like oh relief i've got the combis and the hoot hoot out of the tree will you know we've met you we know how you are sense of relief my butt excuse me excuse me like in the medium level it's already really tight to go from um getting shaman on meganium's head to getting the hoot hoot and the combi out of the tree do you have to do them all do you have to have shaymin on his head to get the hoot and the combi out of the tree or can you do those as separate activities i believe i don't know the answer to that i'm not going to tell you that's what i'm sure i would assume yes you probably do because um because of how he sits down and i think you need him to sit down because him and shaymin both when he sits him and shaymin both smell the tree that's like the that's the shot that mirrors what a reward for hard work and effort but i've gotten i've gotten all the combi to come out of the tree but not the hoot hoot and then he won't sit unless the hoot hoot and the combi are both out of the tree because they're those are like two separate triggers like combi comes out first and then you gotta go a little bit farther to the right and hope you knock out the hoot hoot in time and if you don't knock it out if you don't knock those pokemon out in time then meganium won't sit down um and so in between in between shaman jumping on his head and the crystal that you have to hit and then after you hit the crystal getting them out of the tree you have to find a palm and pichu in that window and that's less than 10 seconds it just it's just this is get get on get good let's get good and i think that all of that would be better if the scan just did what it needed to do which is like just point out what you should do or try instead of just like randomly lobbing apples at a tree which no other mechanic in the entire game has ever asked you to do because like if you were to throw apples at something i don't know there's some i think in the park at night there's a tree with a hole in it that i keep throwing apples into and i'm pretty sure something's gonna happen some day in jungle there is a tree with a hole in it yes at night and if you scan it it will show you there's a pika peck in it no that's not the hole i'm thinking of it's like right before the tree branch before the two look i haven't done jungle enough i'm still on park because now that you actually were talking about secret pass i unlocked a secret path in park and i haven't taken it yet so now i got gotta go back there and do that one i don't know how i unlocked it it just told me at the end of the road one day i was like oh this secret path has opened up but now that greg said the scan didn't work on that very first menu even though it worked on every other minier i wonder if the scan is like slightly bugged no because why wouldn't it work on that very first menu because you said it eventually worked because it was too close it's i mean it could it doesn't make sense that it's too close because other things that are too close also register i don't know if it's i couldn't tell you i spent three hours and i was like this is never triggering i'm clearly missing one and i have how happy did you feel when you finally got it none i had to look it up there's nothing wrong with looking it up no but it's one of those it is one of those situations where you've given me the tools your tools work 95 percent of the time so i rely on them and when they aren't working there isn't feedback to tell you they aren't working so you have no clue that you're even missing something you have no clue that the thing that you've been looking for is because you knew you were looking for something well yeah because it the event that was supposed to trigger never triggered and eventually had to find out online why didn't trigger it because the in-game tools didn't tell me somebody out there persisted in trying every possible combination of scenarios and finally figured it out so they could put it online to tell you data miner oh dagnabbit those people i think i think that though my complaint with the meganium is is such like a one percent complaint it's such a time well like correct you are correct but but it just it just shows the like how what's the words like i think why i wanted to start off with the two positives is because of how great the game can actually be and then if you want to continue playing after credits and the tool like i think right then the challenge level increases yes withholding information uh that your tools work 95 of the time and in this situation it doesn't work the five percent of the time and like having no other situation in the entire game being similar to this i don't know maybe maybe the maybe the one of the other bosses is similar to meganium and i haven't done it enough it like it is it is frustrating um and if you already have like one percent of your players are going to play past credits that i'm i'm that i have no facts of that number i'm just saying like uh there's probably gonna be a small amount of players because most players will probably see credits they'll maybe you know go back through a level a couple more times get the legendaries get the mythicals and then be done but for somebody like me who i want to get all the photos i want to get all 4k i want to get all the titles um it is frustrating because i've already given this game 60 hours and i've spent three plus hours on one meganium level and i still haven't gotten the like by the time i was like i got 1.9 million on this course i'm now number one on my friends list of this course and then for somebody to be like there's still two more pokemon in this level and i'm like i cannot do this level anymore it's been three hours i am number one right now welcome to 1984. yes yeah but just because that's how they were in 1984 or 1972 or whatever doesn't mean that we should still be at this point like yes yes we should yes it is just the frustration comes from you've given us tools for discovery and when those tools of discovery don't work for unknown reasons that is just a frustrating experience you just don't you just don't know why they chose or why it's bugged or why in this one instance this thing that i spent three hours looking for the tool just does not work the tool you told me would work and that that is just game design that's super frustrating right and so to tie it all up and finish this conversation when i bonked that pokemon and he fell off the cliff and i was like oh i didn't think of doing this i did it it worked it was like the smile on my face was was huge when i discovered the secret path in the one level by taking a picture of the pokemon taking a picture of the pokemon taking a picture of the pokemon smile my face was huge there's no smile on my face during the meganium level but they could have eaten i did i watched it they could have easily turned that into a moment where i'm smiling if their tools worked if i'm going through like the beach level and i'm like uh i can't figure out what to do to make this pokemon four star i tried the apple i tried the aluminum illuminati ball i've gone through this level 10 times and then it dawns on me like oh i haven't tried the music and then i go back and i try the music and then it works like you did it again awesome now i got a smile on my face because i went through this level 100 times i didn't think of trying the scan feature i didn't think of trying the music i didn't think of throwing the illuminati ball and then trying the music which works on pokemon by the way um like the game is so good at giving you things to do and then once you do them you go oh i should do that in a different level with these pokemon it does such a good job but doing that and none of what i just described applies to the meganium level the meganium level is just its own weird nothing works no scan i've never done apples like this wow the apples don't even go far enough to the tree without me like looking into the sky and not seeing where anything is ah it is it is probably the worst design level which is a shame because shaman there's a joke there somewhere uh because the other because 95 of the rest of the game is so solid and then this this level is an outlier i'm not going to argue anymore [Laughter] we should take a break though yes uh when we come back we're going to talk about some katy perry and some pokemon tcg we will be right back tricks lucky charms coco puffs tricks golden grahams cocoa puffs cookie crisps cocoa puffs cinnamon toast crunch [Music] is pretty good too [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my gosh and we are back from our break uh this is off pokemon.com katy perry and pokemon together celebrate 25 years with katy perry's electric new song and music video the song is called electric it is on katy perry's official youtube channel uh they launched a specific website for it um they have hoodies and shirts with katy perry and pikachu together i don't know i'm assuming you guys listen to the song yes i listened to it and promptly forgot everything about it except oh i've got i've got words except for two things about the video one she's careless about time travel and two i disagree with you on this one but how is she not blind from staring into the light of a lighthouse multiple times because she's a lot electric uh the song is fine like i i am not a katy perry fan i am not a pop fan i listen to it and then the only katy perry song i can think of whenever someone says oh do you listen all i can hear is roar it's the one song that i remember hearing a lot so all i hear is her screaming roar and not electric i couldn't tell you anything about the song but my one complaint is i expected my pokemon music to be more pokemon and less generic pop songs like post malone was a remake of a song that didn't even happen when pokemon came out this is has apart from the electric type and the video nothing that really links it to pokemon and the merchandise is basically katy you would believe pikachu is named katy perry on these shirts i think the merchandise is cute i like the hoodie a lot i mean they're just it it feels weird to be like i want more pokemon for my pokemon 25th anniversary i don't i it's striking me as weird that it's much more a vehicle about their them just putting out a single then it is like really tiny it looks like the first mewtwo movie it was all none of those songs were pokemon it was like m2m but but uh but the soundtrack for a movie which is establishing that the soundtrack doesn't relate to it it's like saying we're going to put out the 2b a master album but none of these songs relate to pokemon like this is the 25th anniversary music of the franchise and they're tangentially a based at best it's a lose connection some would say a year is you know more exciting than a movie you've got a the soundtrack of 2021 over here i think the year should be more focused on pokemon and less on general i wonder if uh non-pokemon songs verse generic not maybe generic is the right word but you know pop songs hold up the test of time better i mean we can all look at the like diamond and pearl theme songs where they're like rap is real real hot looking like the theme song to diamond and pearl with a little you gotta do the challenges like no one wanted like at the time i don't even think people thought that was cool but it's definitely not cool now like those are some those are some of the worst time songs the poker wrap is timeless so let's poke a hole in that balloon right now uh that will what are your thoughts because you're much more of the pop pop princess i i will try to make a nice sandwich for folks here number one that crochet dress i i could make that but i did appreciate that crochet fashion is top of the line coming back or whatever so congratulations on that lovely crochet dress uh number two taylor swift called from 2020 and wants her aesthetic back uh number three i don't think the time travel issue was a problem in the video she was just happened to self-create her own career that's the time travel paradox if she wasn't time traveled she never would have seen the talent show sign and so what happened the first time when she didn't time travel there was no time there is always how did you like your princess your goddess your teenage dream fireworking roaring i feel like star i don't love roar that much fireworks is okay uh as somebody who i feel like i have to prove receipts like katy perry what's her cat's name what's her cat's name what's her first album where did she get her start wait you don't know katy perry's cat's name oh my gosh this is the most common katy perry fact in the universe it's caddy perry it's kitty purry i fell off a lot of music but i fell off katy perry after the dancing sharks but i do love the i love the dancing sharks they're very good everybody loves the left shark yeah yeah the sharks are great right shark did the job left shark phoned it in and we all loved left shark for feeling how we all feel i remember when i kissed the girl was on the radio and it was very controversial controversial um and i was like i need i i need to know more about this musician and then i got the album and it was good and then i got the follow-up album and it was good and then i got carly ray jumps and jepson's album and that was also pretty good anyways i like i like pop music and now and then this song very unforgettable there's nothing specific very forgettable oh yeah very forgettable there was nothing that really stood out there it wasn't like it was fine it felt like a filler song on one of her albums that's what it felt like it didn't feel like a radio hit like a pillow yeah yeah it felt like a track that was cut from taylor swift's folklore is what it sounds like the music video was super cute the music video is cute the the the song is fine but i for a moment like for an already disappointing 25th anniversary event like this was the big thing i really wanted i really wanted something inspiring or something great and it's like if you really love katy perry and you really love that song great but as a non as a pokemon fan but a not not a katy perry or a pop fan it it again i immediate i listened to it i watched it and then immediately forgot about it like i know it's called electric i think she says electric a lot something about your life being electric i think is the chorus i don't know uh yeah so her her first album i remember seeing katy perry on warped tour when she was traveling with um i believe at the time she was dating the lead singer of gym class heroes if i remember correctly uh so when i saw katy perry on warped tour it would have been i think 2008 2009 that's when obviously i kissed a girl was on the radio i'm kind of shocked a little bit that you went and saw the warp tour wow i went to i went to warped tour five years in a row i think why oh you missed you missed the whole sky i was gator skate [Applause] i don't know you have such a i don't want to be in crowds i don't even want to go to a movie theater the thought of going to the warp tour oh yeah but warp tour is cool because like you have like six stages well warped tours done i think they closed up i don't think they exist anymore you have like six stages and um it wasn't it's not like summerfest like you can see the stage even if you're you know five miles back because you know they put benches on in front of all the stages and everyone just stands on the benches and now everyone's three feet taller because so standing is pointless um yeah i remember gosh i can't believe i just remembered this right now but yeah it was uh the warped tour crowd was not a fan of katy perry well i'm not so they had so warped tour had like six stages they had like the main stage a and the main stage b i don't know why i you know on a pokemon podcast i don't think i ever thought i would be explaining warped to her but what would happen you brought it up what would happen is that um like stage a would go on and then stage b would be setting up and then when stage a was done as soon as they finished stage b would be ready to go so like every 30 minutes each stage would be rotating artists and then there were smaller stages that would also do that so when i saw katy perry live for the first time again as a katy perry fan i kissed a girl and i liked it you know i'm one of the boys that was i believe the name of her album uh well no the album was called katy perry one of the boys was what the first track on the album no i think one of the boys was the oh you're right yes correct so i'm waiting in the crowd to see katy perry i'm like second third row you're right i don't like being in crowds greg this is a different time when i was okay with like people bumping into me this is not imagine you with a bunch of beer bros at the warp tool getting beer spilled on you and being happy about it uh warp tour is not a beer bro tour remember it's vans it was it was the skate it was more of your skaters yeah skaters spilling jager on you i will correct myself and so katy perry was on katy perry was on a smaller stage and so the stages were right next to each other so you had two huge crowds because one crowd would be waiting for the artist the other crowd would be watching the other artists and then i had to suffer through some underoath knockoff i'm not a huge fan of under oath but they were like screamo heart like and i'm that music was cool with me but this was like budget under oath over here and their crowd is very rowdy and katy perry came on after them and rowdy budget under oath crowd very not happy that katy perry is that warped to her and proceeded to throw water bottles at her um and hit her with multiple water bottles and i felt awful but dang what a champ she she she finished she did her all set um do the job you were paid for people but yeah i i really like katy perry um at least her first two albums i absolutely love them this song though i it was it felt like a fuller song to me and i know some people really liked it but i there are a lot of people really like it like i have i have huge just in general problems with i kissed a girl uh as a song and as how things were presented so like the other songs on that album is i think i think katy perry started off very much on the wrong foot with a person that already doesn't like pop music so katy perry has never been a part of my wait like i wrote her off after that i'm like i don't need this how do you feel greg about dua lipa i have never listened oh i all the plans for the remainder of this week are now in question they better i couldn't i could before go to your spotify okay and find dualipas levitating not the one that has the baby on it though you don't want to hear the baby does the plane do it all on her own link it in chat and i'll listen to it i promise eventually uh yeah i kissed a pikachu and it was shocking i'm into that i'm missing that that sounds like a billboard hit um it's cool that they like launched merch with her it's cool that she's doing this that she like i i would hope sasha assumed that she's like really into pokemon and she was excited to do a song and she was excited to do the music video and well i mean did you not see the video she grew up with a pichu i did we didn't see it evolve into a pikachu but she grew up with a pichu they must have been good friends i wish i liked the song more it just doesn't it just didn't jump out to me i mean i feel like if i liked the song as much as i liked you know hotter hot and cold or teenage dream or whatever other songs i can't remember her track listing um i feel like i would actually would have gone out and bought the shirt but i i don't know i love those i don't know i i wish i wasn't a cynical gen xer sometimes because i could i just look at the merchandise i look at the song and i'm like this was just a phoned in cash grab see that's what i hope it's not i hope that she's genuinely excited to do it [Laughter] if the song feels phoned in the everything on the website is like i'm going to slap a pikachu on a katy perry t-shirt and sell it and it just feels very cash grabby to me because i'm a cynical gen xer and i don't trust anything i kind of had a thought towards the end of the video of oh she just did this for the free trip to hawaii i may also be a cynical gen x yeah you've got a couple real big cynics uh but i think i think so far between the two songs as they've been released i am i like that post malone song i just wish they were pokemon related more than they are i just wished for a 25th anniversary event i felt the poke i felt it was much more that they were making songs specifically for this event in this company and not we're gonna have tie-ins we'll have an animated post malone in a pokemon world we'll have a real-life katy perry in a pokemon video and that's our tie-in and that bothers me i mean i'm okay with it but i also i also well like it's weird who buys music anymore like they're like they're selling the album you're like you can pre-order right now it's like 10 bucks or whatever i mean i'm gonna can i go my soapbox like if you like an artist please please buy their music yes streaming doesn't pay them enough please also if you if you like their music enough that you want to listen over and over again make sure that you own it so that a company can't take away your rights from it like get a copy of it that's your own it goes more money goes to the artist that you like but also like spotify can't decide that they no longer want to work with this artist and you lose access to all their music because you never bought it so just i think probably all the people on this album probably don't have to worry about money so far i don't think katy perry or post malone have any money problems yeah we said that about mc hammer too yeah everybody says that but everybody needs a paycheck sometime jeremy irons said the dungeons and dragons movie so he could buy a new car so let's be real about how money works also for clarification i can't really tell if that dress is knit or crochet but it is a yarn fiber it's a cute dress all right uh we got some local news here i'm ready for it i'm ready for it all right so the the the premise of this is not funny i think where the funny comes in is it's literally the target i go to so the funny is funny it starts out with it's wisconsin yeah the funny is like oh i was just there three days ago and this happened um i have also been to this target yes uh so this off waypoint from vice um man pulls gun in a trading card related attack in a target parking lot i like this article because it's not as clickbaity as the other ones um so a break a fight broke out in target parking lot in brookfield wisconsin on friday soon after the store restarts restocked trading cards police arrived to the scene when a witness called them after one man pulled a gun according to a local news report a group of men uh was attacking the gun owner when he pulled out the weapon the target and the trader joe's ironically enough i went to the trader joe's yesterday uh went into a lockdown for an hour until police arrived the man never fired his weapon no one was seriously injured according to police the incident occurred on may 7th at 8 20 a.m outside of target store remember target would only sell cards at 8 a.m on fridays uh which has been a policy of being collecting merchandise according to the police report four men attacked a fifth man when he exited the target carrying a box of sports cards four men have been arrested and charged with battery uh strangulation and disorderly contact conduct pulling a gun during a parking lot scuffle is just the latest story attached to the current resurgence of collecting cards sports magic the gathering and pokemon cards have become so sought over that stores cannot keep them in demand it is also causing a labor crisis as companies that professionally grade cards cannot keep up with the avalanche of cards we've seen this past year we've talked about that with psa i feel like labor crisis is the right word i also think that uh wizards of the coast paid advice to put magic of the gathering in there because you could find those cards literally everywhere there's never been a magic crisis i bought well time spiral but i bought magic cards at target two day two day hey maybe because target is pulling cards which is our next article maybe the magic will be next no no but they're not oh i mean they're not playing magic cards but yes right uh it is common to have 50 plus people standing in line all day six to eight hours waiting to see if they can get one box of cards brookfield sports memorabilia memorabilia store owner jeff told wisn 12 news target had previously promised to call the police on rowdy customers but is unclear who notified the cops in brookfield target has already altered its policy limiting the number of collectible items that can be purchased in a day only sell selling the items briefly on friday mornings and asking customers not to wait in the parking lot overnight you know as funny as the local news reached out to me asking if i could give insight on this and i was like i realized i've been to this target too i was like i would love to give you my opinion on the local news but you can't call me an hour before and say do you have time now because i'm in like three meetings today so um obviously i will read the second story off the bat and then we'll talk about this this is off the verge target will stop selling pokemon cards in stores target has decided they had enough the company has officially confirmed that they will halt the sales of pokemon cards throughout the united states starting on friday may 14th the retailer the retailer cites an abundance of caution for both safety of the guests and store employees and notes that it will be selling cards on its website only currently pokemon cards and other trading cards have a moment uh it's it's sports cards you can just say sports cards yeah uh versus not magic uh or you could it's definitely not yugioh like people the tweet that they attach clearly has magic cards waiting to be purchased behind it uh people have swamped the card grading companies hoping to get their ratings on cards more valuable the pokemon company has been rushing to print enough cards to meet demand and it uh seems that all big numbers around truly rare original cards have caused a lot of new excitement about cards as well and then they talk about how target started limiting cards and that's that's the the gist of it so uh target is done selling pokemon cards for now they said that they will probably come back um so i have some thoughts on this i don't want to sugarcoat that pokemon cards are not in demand i mean they are but the i feel like out of all these stories and i feel like this show included we have really kind of pushed aside how big the sports card market is right now market is huge and and if and so this is what's happening um and this is not what like uh like obviously people still want pokemon cards although i would say it's kind of died down with battle styles and i'll get to that um but what is happening is the sports cards are worth way more than pokemon cards so these resellers will wait in line at target at 8 am and they plan all of them most of them almost all of them plan on getting sports cards and if there are not sports cards they will then default to pokemon cards because they're not waiting in line for two hours to leave empty-handed they are they need to resell something um and so the sports card market is directly hurting the pokemon market because scalpers need to walk away with something and pokemon cards still can be flipped for a slight profit not as much as it used to be with vivid voltage and darkness ablaze and shining fates and champions path because let me tell you no one is buying battle styles at an increased price and if they are they're truly desperate because there's nothing fantastic in that set there's no charizards there's no pikachus um and uh no one knows who a nurse shifu is besides people who listen to this podcast um now i am not saying that if target didn't sell sports cards it would that pokemon card the pokemon card issue would be fixed there are still plenty of people who are reselling pokemon cards there are still plenty of people who are buying as many as they can to pull the good ones to then sell them individually as singles those people still exist but i am i am saying that this show and a lot of these websites reporting are really just ignoring the fact that sports cards are out of control right now um and i mean i wouldn't say that we're ignoring it i mean we acknowledge it but that's not the point of our show well it's like it's not uh yeah so i think ignore is the wrong word but it's not our emphasis this is not our focus well when you look at people reporting on this the thing that grabs headlines is pokemon cards right right well it's never like children are in danger there's your your correlation right there like uh i was listening to another gaming podcast and and one week they were like oh yeah i guess they're limiting sports cards i don't know why we all know everyone's there for pokemon cards and the following week they were like oh i didn't know that sports cards were like this huge thing and it's like and so when you read these headlines of like oh they're pulling pokemon cards like yeah but they're also pulling the actual problem here yeah which is the sports cards cards and i i don't even know where i can go on the internet to learn more about this like i don't know what about i've i've been told that the sports card boxes are twenty dollars and then they sell them for a hundred and fifty dollars um i don't know if is it a specific card that people want is it like uh it's like players it's players players it's so i worked at i worked at a card shop uh for a while in my twenties um and it it really it varies but just like just like in pokemon certain things become super expensive or super rare or super sought out it's the same thing with sports i mean they can be much more targeted because you know you're looking for x player or x team or x whatever um but the reality is is there are way more sports card collectors than there are pokemon card players yes like there are sports cards and sports memorabilia has a huge audience a huge uh history of these cards being in the public eye people know what they are uh they only make so many teams change so it's not like you know they're going to reprint you know the twins lineup from 85 again in a 2020 set but with new card mechanics like they are tied to specific things and you know some things can come back but in general you like the amount of the sports card market and the amount of people that collect it when i worked at schinder's news and books the absolute top selling thing the thing we made the most money on with sports cards uh shortly after that was adult materials but number one was sports cards can i ask a dumb question yeah you can't do anything with sports cards right why do you put them in a binder no no i know that but like with pokemon cards like no there's no you can there's a game to it i mean so there are usually like stats and trivia and stuff on the back of the garden stuff about the player so the chewing gum don't forget the chewing gum no that was a thing like there are people who are so mad that uh like they would specifically ask for packs where they could uh see that the chewing gum was still slightly pliable because it wouldn't have ruined the card that it was on and then eventually sporting card people just stopped putting the gun in all together because it was ruining the card value uh no sports card collecting is displaying right like you have cards you're putting them in frames people put them in frames they have their favorite players they bring those cars like there used to be and it will probably come back but downtown minneapolis has a hotel where sports stars would stay in a specific hotel and then every friday morning there would be a line up of people waiting to get their cards autographed because they were glossy pictures with their name and stuff and they would get it autographed that would bring the price up so like there's a huge culture around sports cards that is just like displaying it or getting it signed by your person but no there's no game to it you don't play with them you don't it's just that they're appearing long history and lore it's like maybe in the 1950s everybody was like oh these baseball cards are just for kids but like by the 80s it was like do you have the 1957 joe palace jack because that one has like one pixel off in the print and that's worth about 250 000 in my store we had we had because we also sold magic cards and that was when the black lotus the original was high priced right yeah so we had a black lotus for 200 for a hundred dollars in behind the case that paled in comparison to the one thousand dollar card that was sealed in a large wedge of plastic that was in two cases that was locked down because somebody could come in and purchase that like the pricing was unbelievable and we had specialists in store that would know how to like if somebody came to me with a sports question i was like okay you have to go talk to this person because they have to do all the things to get you this card and talk to you about this card and talk to you about the mint and all of the stuff that goes around rating these cards is there like ultra rares and reverse holos and like do people do people like the whole like i want the whole set of series two i mean there were people who wanted whole sets of series i i know that they were sometimes special print cards i think hollow cards and that were really part of the game like card game things i again it's been a long time since i hadn't been around sports cards they may have introduced this to sports cards i highly doubt it because it never needed it uh but they were special they were definitely rare cards like they were definitely you know and there were definitely people i was like i have been searching for every card of every player that was a part of this sports team at this time period so they wanted a card for all the players that played in 1968 and so they would travel the world trying to find to complete their team yeah but the point is the player right not the production of the card right or the rarity of the car it's just like that player that they want to have the card for that player um so the this target in in brookfield uh is is a very nice target it is a target where they you ever you ever been to a target and you can tell how good the target is or how bad the target is based on how much is on clearance have you ever noticed that like the bad targets have so much on clearance and the good targets that are like always very clean and very upcat like their clearance section is like nothing um didn't know there was a clearance section at target yeah there can be this target never has clearance this target is this target is you go there uh all their consoles are always sold out um all the nice stuff is always picked over there's no clearance it is it is a it is a target that you do not go to if you're looking for stuff if you need anything you don't go to this target because they don't got it and if you definitely if you want clearance you ain't going to this target this is a very nice target it is in brooklyn wisconsin a very uh up uppity city it is an upscale target in an upscale market brookfield is a is a high corporate area i have to stay there when i go there for work um um i i can't say that i'm bummed that they're pulling cards because i cannot even remember the last time i got cards at target like their shelves are just empty consistently my go-to wait i remember the last time you got cards at target because you put it on instagram it was like three days ago yeah it was yesterday no it was on friday it was the day after the gun incident i went into that target they had a bunch of the gallerian ponytas it was pretty and all of them had stickers that said do not back stock so i think at that point i actually grabbed two gallerian ponytas they had six of them i grabbed two they had a bunch of booster packs for battle styles and then when i went to checkout it yelled at me and then the lady was like you can only get one and i was like oh that's weird because literally two days ago your rules said limit three but the register was smart enough to know that it was more than one so anyways i got one gallerian ponytail it was my last purchase at target but i'm assuming they just pulled everything forward and they just said one per person buy it we don't want it anymore don't back stock don't keep these in the back i think it's sad for the game like there are a lot of families that go to target and like it was an easy vector for pokemon to get cards in family's hands i think that i think the current sort of climate that we're in now is just it's a harmful client and ultimately harmful to the tcg and things like this pulling it out of a very common big box store is it's not a great look for for the tcg well i mean yes definitely but also right the concept the reason why they have the cards at target and why they are situated where they are situated in target is so that parents can take their kid to target and say all right if you're good i'll get you a pack of cards pack cards at the end i mean like most targets at least the milwaukee targets maybe i'm maybe i'm speaking poorly here but most targets didn't have any stock they they purposely saved it all for the friday mornings um so it wasn't it wasn't in ever since like november uh there wasn't ever the parent impulse buy of like let's get you a pack of vivid voltage because i can't even remember seeing booster packs of vivid voltage i will say at the target i went to today um they did have the big size the pikachu yeah the pikachu yeah um my go-to place has still been barnes noble uh i don't know if scalpers don't know this i feel like they probably do would you stop giving it away i know i see through barnes and noble yesterday they had six etbs on the shelf for battle styles they had all of the theme decks they had they had champions path i was like oh i don't want i don't need any more champions path um and consistently i would say four out of five times i go to barnes noble they have carts at msrp um and i bet they wouldn't have cards if they sold baseball cards next to those pokemon cards so again i'm not saying that like baseball cards are 100 ruining pokemon cards but again i think a lot of these news media outlets are overlooking the fact that the scalpers want baseball cards and if they can't get them they buy the pokemon cards yeah that's just less fun though in general people don't like knocking on sports the way they like knocking on nerd things right like like buying buying sports memorabilia has always been seen as more legitimate than buying video games so the headline that's going to get views and clicks is ragging on the video game absolutely absolutely babe ruth over pikachu charizard yeah but let's get babe ruth to make a 25th anniversary pokemon song buddy if that could happen science will have worked wonders okay okay this is we got two short news articles and then we'll wrap it up here so we got this off pokemon.com scout nessa and dreadnaught and b and serfetch and pokemon masters ex things are getting wet and wild on passio i

doing villain stories like at the end of it you're like i can't even imagine why is nobody putting this person in jail they are still clearly a villain they are clearly not repentant about anything they've done in the past and have said they're going to continue to be evil going into the future why are these people just allowed to run around on this island please somebody somebody take care of bossio doesn't have any prisons but they have nothing they have a bunch of villains that are all teaming up to destroy everybody uh i just started i mean doesn't a villain run their like champion club or whatever i am not going to give spoilers away about the the leader of pasio island and their connection to team break or no connection to team break i'm not gonna spoil it okay fair enough i i feel like this is a problem that i have i don't know if you guys can relate like i remember the last time i played clash royale it was when sword and shield came out like when a new big game comes out and i get addicted to it it cuts off a game that i would have previously been addicted to well i'm not saying i'm not coming back to masters but the hard cutoff was the day pokemon snap came out like they're like my brain can only juggle so many games at the time why do you think my animal crossing village was abandoned oh never to be seen again yeah they they were left to their own they have been left to their own devices good luck i am off to galler and i will never speak to any of you again see i don't think this happens with will though will is like all in on gardenscapes all in on monster hunter all in and like will does a little of everything every day well yeah because i'm not a game gobbler and i take things very very slowly i did i did walk away from animal crossing because it became animal chores yes right and uh i mean i was also watching a video where this person i know had basically dug like a thousand holes on their island so that they could make rocks show up in just like one particular location and i was like no no this is not this is the opposite of fun now i don't know i thought it was otherwise that was fun for while i was playing animal crossing uh mobile games for me are they need to be quick hits so like pokemon masters i do 10 minutes on when i'm on a work meeting like what in things where i don't need to pay attention i hit it quick it's the thing like pokemon go i play it for 10 minutes in the morning and that's literally all i'll do all day and this is community today mobile games for me need to be the quick burst where i'm in and then i'm out uh bigger games like animal crossing like i can no longer devote time to you because if i'm gonna be on my switch the amount of time i need for animal crossing i would much rather be playing pokemon and when mitopia comes out i will no longer play snap [Laughter] i'm so addicted to snap i am not a leaderboard person but the snap leader boards are they got you you are a leaderboard person now exactly yeah i am a leaderboard person now uh last bit of news here is off pokemongolive.com the lumia luminous luminous i got there i got there luminous legends why yveltal joins xerneas and pokemon go and team rocket team go rocket wants it on the action um during the second week of the legends events the focus will shift from fairy uh to fairy pokemon and evie why because sylveon will making will be making its pokemon go debut the in intertwining pokemon is is an evolution of evs first discovered in the kalos region uh the gallerian fairy tale that described the beautiful sylveon vanquishing a dreadful dragon pokemon making sylveon the perfect pokemon to appear at the end of the dark themed event now i mean there's there's a lot there's a lot of stretching in that sentence but okay look forward to this fairy type vanquisher of darkness dread and dragons during part two of the legends event so this will start on may 18th through may 24th evil tall will be making its five-star raid debut in pokemon go it is a dark and flying type legendary pokemon first discovered in the kalos region pan sham will be hatching from strange eggs we have received reports that the following pokemon will also be hatching from strange eggs as well quail fish larvaetar absolutes groupie sandile scraggy pioneered lullaby and dino ooh i like me a dino yeah eight strange eggs because i'm not walking 12 kilometers ever which one is the strange one the red red the red ones that you get from defeating uh uh go rocky out i'm out um dark type pokemon will be appearing more in the wild like houndour and carvana i like how they only gave two examples well i mean those are the ones that pokemon go players know they did say and more it's just like gilligan's island when many characters were lumped into as the rest missed out on some pokemon during the first event while you're in luck many of them are returning you can look out for pokemon like spritzes spritzy swirlix and gumi appearing in the wild uh there is timed research that includes encounters with dark type pokemon like gallerian zigzagoon uh the following pokemon will be from 7k eggs alolan rattata alolan and purloin dark type pokemon like alolan meowth evital will be appearing in raids uh event exclusive research will lead to encounters with dark type pokemon including valerian zigzagoon and scraggy that's cool uh event exclusive ar mapping tests will lead to gallery and zigzagoon that's where you walk around the pokestop and scan it oh i feel so bad doing that i feel like i'm ratting out a pokestop to the pokemon company like they're they want me to verify that it's there and if it's not there anymore they're gonna take that stop away correct no i feel so bad about it clean up your community okay that was that was a soft road rumor and that that has never happened like there is no proof are you sure yeah because at any every stop they've asked me to ar map has been a stop that's been there and i've refused to do ones that i know aren't there anymore like the post office downtown i'm not going to remove the post office it's a but the post office isn't there anymore post office isn't there anymore the most destroyed the post office yes the post office is closed they rebuilt the entire life in real life that the post office that was closest to my office got destroyed and remodeled into a lobby in some other store it's gone i won't tell them i won't tell them about it and i have it five times none of my stops have been removed but were the stops still there were they still the thing that they said they were yeah i think so see that's the thing i don't want to sk the ones that i have are some things that okay so there are what like a billion poke stops who's checking these the people on that website whatever it's called i no the the the ar scan does not go to um the niantic website like i no no one can steer scans but that i know of where do the scans go they go i'm assuming they go right to niantic they don't like you when you scan like a a religious statue at a cemetery like no one is seeing like that data from your phone isn't going to um what's it called what is that thing called the the wayfinder wayfinder yeah it's not going directly to wayfinder like that information up there not directly but indirectly because they have they have the kill the pokestops team look i have a friend locally who wants to destroy pokemon stops because things don't exist there anymore and i am fighting that i am fighting them by not scanning things that aren't there anymore so that means there is no way that there aren't thousands of people doing the scans every day that's so much data going back to niantic i'm sure they're using it for something but i don't think like they're there's somebody at the the checklist being like next awesome okay wait wait wait have you ever tried listening to my cell phone calls to log in to something on a web browser and it comes up and it says look at this grid of nine pictures which one is the post office that used to go greg used to go to and you have to click it right you've done this yeah because guess what those pictures come from mr google who owns mr niantic that's true is is this function the scan function is this an ingress i think it has to be an ingress right oh i have no idea like i would assume ingress players are also scanning whatever i mean i've submitted pokestops that have gotten approved but they never showed up but they show up in ingress but they do say that on wayfinder they say like we don't use pokestops for every game i've also had it where gyms turn into pokestops and then pokestops turn into gyms yes where they randomly like flip that switch all i'm saying is i am not giving big brother niantic any ammunition to close down my stops by doing their i will only are scared things that i know that the entire city of minneapolis is also not ar scanning that or pokestop yes we have all we all have an agreement except for one person and i know them personally who's trying to ruin everybody's fun not unless you live in some town of 200 people where you got three pokestops has the whole city agreed let's not ar skin you don't know our facebooks you don't know our discords you don't know how we talk everybody assumes everybody in minneapolis knows each other and that isn't a correct assessment we have all agreed except for one person who's like i'm gonna i'm gonna kill that stop because it's not there anymore sylveon will be making its pokemon go debut uh it will evolve into evie what wow that's some magic they got it backward i think out of backwards evolve evie into sylveon by earning hearts when it's your buddy uh evie ralph spritzy swarlux will be appearing in the wild alongside dark type pokemon um ev's evolutions vaporeon jolteon flareon espeon and umbreon will be appearing in three star raids um what about that yeah you know blurs uh event exclusive tasks will lead to encounters with evs and its evolutions exclusive ar mapping tasks will reward poffins no i will not sell out my stops for poffins i cannot be bought you better believe i'll sell off the poppins sylveon inspired albums so i avatar items will be added to the shop okay that's it that's that's your pokemon go news greg do you want to do question of the week sure okay dearest pj ask away i can't wait to hear what you will pick for the question of the week was that a cover of katy perry's electric no because i don't know what that song sounds like all i know is it goes electric [Music] you laughing at you know that's gonna be a thing uh this is a question from jorts do you think pokemon would benefit from adding in players choice with those choices having an actual impact on game uh progression i am assuming this is like a mass effects or a dragon age where you have a dialogue tree and then you pick those things and it leads you down a branching path they already do this though helix fossil or dome make your choice and move on no big no stop why do you exist uh do do i think it would benefit from it [Music] maybe like they would have to have a much more complex story and i don't think they're going to do that so do i think do i think implementing this to get a much more complex story would benefit pokemon yes um but they would need to have much better stories i think that that is a there is a a non-linear aspect of having branching pathways that is hard it's already not easily accessed by a lot of people like that there are always people who are going to want an optimized sort of experience and a lot of choices things are leading to like this is the best best this is the not best this is oh you min maxing yeah and so in in a game that really does lean into min maxing in a lot of ways or overpowering i think i think it's a tough fit i think i think it would be a better fit for a game like coliseum or uh gale of darkness where there is where it's a that's a very story driven sort of hey you are fighting this team do you rescue this do you stop this person do you do that where you know you already have a small pool of things you can collect i think that fits better with that than the main large collecting game yeah i already i i don't want to say i hate i don't love it i don't hate it but when when they do do things like dome or helix which eevee do you want um which hershey food do you want like i want everything yeah and so when you start giving me like choices especially like oh if i do this this is going to change that point of the game like now i'm i could feel like i'm frustrated that nah i gotta play it again if i want to see that choice or i gotta look it up or yes like with the hershey food thing i had to play twice because i wanted both hershey foods well that's the thing it's like i think they've hit the limit of of a branching path concept number one by fundamentally making you have to choose are you going to do this game that has these version exclusives or this game that has these version exclusives and anything more that they do within that that would limit you to getting one pokemon or another pokemon which let's be honest would be the whole point of having branching paths in a pokemon game right uh like one would lead you to one legendary and one with legion yeah exactly that would create problems in the community in a maine series the more and it's like it would it would literally just inspire people to hack more they already did that though you want one you want this horse or you want that horse yeah but that's version exclusivity because i just have it like on both my versions and in my sword version i got ice horse and in right version i get ghost tours i think they've done as much as the game and the community can handle uh i think if if they leaned into it more in a main series game i think it would overall hurt i think it would hurt the game more if they did something where i feel like a pokemon game did this if if they i i still dislike the consequence of losing in a pokemon game because all it does is it takes your money and then that puts you at a disadvantage because you can't then use you're losing money where like let's say let's say you went through a battle this is a very common thing probably with a younger audience maybe like eight or ten years old especially me as a kid because i was dumb but you know you're you're in a battle with the elite four and you use all your potions use all your revives during the battle you make it all the way to lance let's just do red and blue and then you lose the lance and he takes your money now you have less money and you have no more hyper potions you have no more super potions you have no revives because you used them all and you lost and now it feels like it's this uphill battle because either you if if you don't buy anything because you don't have enough money and you go through again you don't have those potions you don't have those revives you lose again and they take even more money so your actual and it's not like in in those older pokemon games at least there's ways to make money like if you battled all the trainers if you found all the nuggets like you don't have income so um your best option is to at least in my opinion is to buy as much as you can buy don't use any of it go through the elite four let them defeat you and then use whatever remaining money you have and buy again and then at a certain point where you think you're going to win the run then you use those potions and those but the game it's such a weird mechanic to be like oh well we're taking money from you instead and maybe this goes back to george questions adding players choice like if trainers change their pokemon based on whether you won or lost or how good you did i think that would be more exciting i don't know if that ties into the question like um instead of like when you get to your rival like the first rival battle you're allowed to lose right like the game doesn't black you out you don't like it it continues on i would if if you if you beat that rival he should have stronger pokemon and if you lose that rival um maybe his pokemon get weaker and or like if or the other way around to get the challenge to balance right yeah so that's not really player choice though that's not a choice the player's making that's true yeah that's that is that is a that is a a consequence of in-game activity which i think is good but it is a different than i've made a choice to go down this path i've made a choice to lose to this guy i made a choice to lose to lance yeah that's true that's not player's choice um it's an interesting thing to think about yeah i think i think depending on where they go with the series i i would love to see more just pure role-playing games that have a limited pool of pokemon that you can get that would have branching paths like you know going into it this isn't a collecting game this is you know this is the story uh like caleb darkness was to some extent um and i think they should add more in there i think for the main series that is much more about collecting they have reached the limit of is it this or this are you gonna pick one of these three starters like i think i think they've reached what the community can can tolerate i think i think that could be pokemon legends yeah it could be no definitely i think i think that would be an opportunity for something like that that's more like skyrim than say a traditional pokemon game right well what is our pokemon of the week well what was our pokemon of the week last week folks it uh started out that it wasn't ihop number one so you had to think of the other one and if you were thinking huddle house please there's like six huddle houses in the entire united states obviously not what i what is the other one greg what are you serious answer for the people steve if it's not ihop what is it what's the other one pancake house why do you die not original pancake house waffle house waffle house waffle house is we i'm pretty certain i have been to a waffle house with you in indianapolis yes but not wisconsin no still it's no look all of this is irrelevant it's not fact it's highly relevant that it's waffle house and then you have to take the word waffle and make all those adjustments to the letters that i indicated where you replace the f's with p's and you get apple and then you also have to recognize that the letter which in english is w but in most other languages is double v uh which then i said is a double letter so replace it with two letters those two letters one being the f that you replaced with the p previously and the l that is at the l e end of the word and you get it's guava fat ooh wobble fat house wobba fat is not fruit based it's flapple flapple yes which i also believe mentioned like the week prior like have i ever done flapples appleton wisconsin there is trivia on flapple yeah there's oh nobody goes to appleton mm-hmm yeah appleton's love i only know what apple thing is that friend of mine grew up there i only know appleton because there's a youtube video of a person complaining about the candles that she purchased from bed bath and beyond and it's about a half hour video uh just so we all know there is no shuffle icon and it breaks my heart flapple and appleton are the only pokemon to have identical gigantomax forms although they are still treated as different pokemon and have um distinct pokedex entry gmax moves and cries this is also the only instance of two different species of pokemon that can uh that can be physically uh identical without the use of transform imposter or illusion flapland its evolutionary family are the only ones in the grass and dragon type egg group even though flapple's pokedex entry refers to spitting acid it cannot learn apple acid called apple acid only apple 10 can learn apple acid what does it do it is an 80 power move 100 accuracy it's a special grass and it will lower the special defenses stacked by one stage target's special defense statement set to my cute little rose well i can't learn it only apple tinkling yeah at this time yeah of course every signature every singer's your move gets spread out you know flapple might be a combination of flap and apple whoa what or flying apple possibly or flow apple no there's no apple's got no flow what about next week all right here we go i believe steve the cartoon and many others have maligned this wonderful pokemon this week's clue is a list mouse pokemon tiny mouse pokemon cheering pokemon or cheering pokemon ella's squirrel pokemon antenna pokemon roly-poly pokemon two-sided pokemon a 2012 version of this pokemon in the pokemon trading card game featured the popular attack call for family which for one colorless energy allows you to search for two basic pokemon and put them onto your bench that's all you need i know call for family it's like was printed on 400 different tcg cards so it's literally not even a clue okay um okay well we will be back next a week of course uh no greg or well on the show next
