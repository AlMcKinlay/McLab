570th episode we have these written down (0:27 - 0:34)
of the Pokemon podcast it's super (0:30 - 0:37)
effective I'm your house (0:34 - 0:41)
[Laughter] (0:37 - 0:43)
10 (0:41 - 0:46)
because Craig is yes (0:43 - 0:48)
deliberately went in there because you (0:46 - 0:51)
had it at 560. I'm like that's wrong I (0:48 - 0:53)
deliberately changed it to 570 to get it (0:51 - 0:57)
right and use for like I'm like he's (0:53 - 0:59)
gonna say 560. this is where we're stuck (0:57 - 1:01)
we're never getting off the show episode (0:59 - 1:03)
number (1:01 - 1:03)
uh I'm here I'm here (1:04 - 1:07)
I not not in a vest I will note not (1:08 - 1:16)
today but it was yesterday yeah I also (1:12 - 1:17)
realized in the last week that I (1:16 - 1:20)
actually owned three and not two vests (1:17 - 1:21)
um (1:20 - 1:25)
but but not today (1:21 - 1:25)
uh having a real hard time finding the (1:27 - 1:32)
night spawns in Pokemon go that's my my (1:30 - 1:34)
one main Pokemon thing in in this last (1:32 - 1:36)
week it's really hard to stay up late (1:34 - 1:38)
enough to get the night spawns in the (1:36 - 1:39)
new event (1:38 - 1:41)
because they start two hours after (1:39 - 1:43)
Sunset and sunset's real late here right (1:41 - 1:44)
now (1:43 - 1:45)
um (1:44 - 1:48)
yeah real late here (1:45 - 1:52)
we're approaching those 9 30 sunsets we (1:48 - 1:53)
do we do have Pokemon go news near the (1:52 - 1:55)
end of the show but uh we also have Greg (1:53 - 1:58)
here I am also here and I'm not on the (1:55 - 2:01)
30 Bananas a Day Diet (1:58 - 2:03)
we can't we can't talk about this again (2:01 - 2:06)
we're just opening the door I am (2:03 - 2:08)
drinking a banana Soylent though so this (2:06 - 2:10)
is what brought it up he's drinking a (2:08 - 2:11)
bit of toilet and then we got out of the (2:10 - 2:13)
whole pre-show topic about the 30 (2:11 - 2:16)
Bananas a Day Diet and don't look it up (2:13 - 2:18)
it's a nightmare (2:16 - 2:20)
I feel like sometimes like pre-show is (2:18 - 2:23)
longer than the actions (2:20 - 2:23)
uh okay so we have (2:24 - 2:27)
um (2:26 - 2:28)
some scarlet and violet stuff very (2:27 - 2:31)
little uh that Team Rocket collection is (2:28 - 2:33)
here and I feel like I need to talk (2:31 - 2:36)
about it because I'm very weirded out by (2:33 - 2:39)
it it's uh oh we'll get there but boy (2:36 - 2:44)
the uh the bonus set I guess I don't (2:39 - 2:45)
remember what they're called special (2:44 - 2:48)
sets seasonal sets the 151 card set is (2:45 - 2:50)
coming out soon (2:48 - 2:53)
um and there was a new Niantic store (2:50 - 2:54)
it's not really that new it's been (2:53 - 2:56)
around for like two months we just (2:54 - 2:58)
haven't talked about it uh so we're (2:56 - 2:59)
gonna talk about it (2:58 - 3:01)
um and that's pretty much Today's Show (2:59 - 3:04)
so let's start off with the exciting (3:01 - 3:06)
stuff because it's only downhill after (3:04 - 3:09)
this obviously (3:06 - 3:09)
um (3:09 - 3:11)
I actually think the Niantic store is (3:10 - 3:15)
cool but uh starting on June 30th (3:11 - 3:17)
uh you can tune into the live broadcast (3:15 - 3:21)
of the 2023 North American International (3:17 - 3:23)
championships to receive some digital (3:21 - 3:25)
distributions this is off the play (3:23 - 3:27)
Pokemon Twitter (3:25 - 3:31)
uh hey look at them giving us that's the (3:27 - 3:33)
news in itself not the actual gifts the (3:31 - 3:39)
the actual heads up oh FYI true that (3:33 - 3:41)
stuff is coming ah they did this for (3:39 - 3:43)
worlds they were like hey you're getting (3:41 - 3:45)
a Victini and a synasty (3:43 - 3:48)
um but uh we are getting our first shiny (3:45 - 3:51)
distribution so I cannot wait for (3:48 - 3:53)
everyone to say they're devaluing (3:51 - 3:56)
shinies uh and how dare they give away (3:53 - 3:58)
free shinies even though the comments (3:56 - 3:59)
before that was like why isn't this (3:58 - 4:02)
Pokemon Shiny I like to put those two (3:59 - 4:05)
audiences in a room with each other uh (4:02 - 4:07)
so uh we're getting a shiny Arcanine (4:05 - 4:10)
that will be holding safety goggles (4:07 - 4:13)
and it will have um the grass type Tara (4:10 - 4:19)
this was uh Paul (4:13 - 4:19)
gosh I can't remember his last name (4:19 - 4:21)
right now (4:20 - 4:23)
I don't know how to say it it's Chua (4:21 - 4:26)
c-h-u-a oh yeah yeah I think that is (4:23 - 4:28)
that is it (4:26 - 4:33)
um so because they won at euic (4:28 - 4:35)
uh (4:33 - 4:38)
and because they will always take like (4:35 - 4:42)
the oldest most basic Pokemon out of the (4:38 - 4:44)
mix (4:42 - 4:45)
um that's why we always get for the (4:44 - 4:47)
record that's why we always get (4:45 - 4:51)
gastrodite every time (4:47 - 4:53)
I've gotten like eight (4:51 - 4:55)
champion gastrodons in like the last (4:53 - 4:58)
like 10 years well the gastrodon's a (4:55 - 5:01)
champion so that's true that is that is (4:58 - 5:03)
very true he is a champion people (5:01 - 5:05)
complain about Legendary Pokemons but no (5:03 - 5:06)
one's complaining about the power of (5:05 - 5:08)
gastrodon (5:06 - 5:09)
um so we're getting that shiny Arcanine (5:08 - 5:12)
and then if you're playing TCG live uh (5:09 - 5:14)
you will get the (5:12 - 5:16)
uh so sought after (5:14 - 5:19)
iono card (5:16 - 5:21)
in that you'll get a digital version of (5:19 - 5:22)
that card not the real version of the (5:21 - 5:24)
card even though (5:22 - 5:25)
the real version of the card isn't worth (5:24 - 5:27)
as much as it (5:25 - 5:29)
was worth (5:27 - 5:31)
two months ago but that's like all cards (5:29 - 5:32)
that's (5:31 - 5:35)
it's the nature of like (5:32 - 5:38)
it's a TCG uh so that's cool that I (5:35 - 5:40)
think (5:38 - 5:42)
I feel like we've gotten digital cars (5:40 - 5:44)
before (5:42 - 5:46)
um but this is the first one for TCG (5:44 - 5:48)
live that I (5:46 - 5:51)
pretty sure on uh for (5:48 - 5:55)
worlds in London I think we got like (5:51 - 5:58)
secret gold rare path to the peak I (5:55 - 6:00)
think (5:58 - 6:02)
um (6:00 - 6:02)
but the the only thing that would be (6:03 - 6:08)
probably cooler or as cool not cooler (6:05 - 6:09)
but I wonder when they'll start doing (6:08 - 6:11)
like Pokemon Go stuff (6:09 - 6:13)
like it would kind of be cool to get (6:11 - 6:14)
like (6:13 - 6:18)
you got uh (6:14 - 6:21)
uh insert trainer name here you got (6:18 - 6:24)
their like toga kiss that's great League (6:21 - 6:28)
ready that is like 14 98 CP and comes (6:24 - 6:29)
with (6:28 - 6:32)
considering how hard it is to get a good (6:29 - 6:34)
PVP Pokemon in Pokemon go that would (6:32 - 6:36)
actually be really useful but I can't (6:34 - 6:39)
imagine how they do it well here we are (6:36 - 6:40)
out they would put them as trainers at (6:39 - 6:42)
trainer stops and then you'd fight them (6:40 - 6:44)
like Team Rocket and then you can catch (6:42 - 6:48)
the one that they wanted to give away (6:44 - 6:48)
I mean you could argue that getting a (6:48 - 6:52)
Shiny Pokemon is hard for the average (6:50 - 6:54)
person right like somebody who just (6:52 - 6:56)
plays through like someone who just puts (6:54 - 6:58)
40 hours in the game and gets the credit (6:56 - 6:59)
it's like getting a Shiny Pokemon is (6:58 - 7:01)
tough for them (6:59 - 7:03)
um (7:01 - 7:05)
us us hardcore people listen to this (7:03 - 7:08)
podcast are probably swimming in Chinese (7:05 - 7:11)
I'm lousy with shiny he's got nothing (7:08 - 7:13)
but shinies from here to here (7:11 - 7:15)
but yeah you're you're right like (7:13 - 7:18)
getting a (7:15 - 7:20)
getting a uh (7:18 - 7:23)
competitive viable yeah (7:20 - 7:26)
the the stats are just weird and so if (7:23 - 7:28)
you don't actually pay attention to (7:26 - 7:32)
what's a zero 15 15 IVs in Pokemon go (7:28 - 7:33)
and just release those because they're (7:32 - 7:36)
not a three star or a four star (7:33 - 7:37)
you're not keeping the ones that are (7:36 - 7:39)
great for great League or Ultra league (7:37 - 7:41)
in PvP (7:39 - 7:41)
yeah I mean I I don't know what the (7:42 - 7:47)
distribution system is like for Niantic (7:45 - 7:48)
they (7:47 - 7:52)
I do remember when the Chicago go Fest (7:48 - 7:54)
did not work and they put everyone's (7:52 - 7:56)
loogie and they gave like everyone that (7:54 - 7:59)
went a Lugia into their box but that was (7:56 - 8:04)
like the weirdest yeah it like worked (7:59 - 8:04)
but that it like came up as costume even (8:05 - 8:10)
though it isn't wearing a cost did I (8:08 - 8:13)
throw this lugioh (8:10 - 8:17)
you checked it into the candy maker (8:13 - 8:19)
um (8:17 - 8:19)
but I feel like they should do something (8:19 - 8:22)
for go even if it was like what's (8:21 - 8:24)
another good competitive Pokemon (8:22 - 8:27)
um I don't know like uh (8:24 - 8:31)
uh metucham right (8:27 - 8:33)
they could they could give you like a (8:31 - 8:35)
meta tight that's not like leveled up (8:33 - 8:38)
but is like the correct CP and then you (8:35 - 8:40)
have to put the candy into it I mean (8:38 - 8:42)
they could it's the give you part that (8:40 - 8:44)
is like a whole new (8:42 - 8:49)
you don't really get given a Pokemon (8:44 - 8:51)
you get the opportunity to catch a (8:49 - 8:53)
Pokemon and so Greg's idea kind of works (8:51 - 8:54)
although usually when there are trainers (8:53 - 8:57)
that aren't uh Team Rocket you don't (8:54 - 8:59)
catch a Pokemon after you battle them I (8:57 - 9:02)
think usually yeah but they clearly have (8:59 - 9:05)
the technology judging by the thousands (9:02 - 9:07)
of Team Rocket grunts I have to deal (9:05 - 9:10)
with in my day-to-day life (9:07 - 9:10)
I do have that Lugia still his name (9:11 - 9:17)
and we were a baited breath uh Beluga (9:14 - 9:20)
Lugia watch (9:17 - 9:22)
the Lugia watch (9:20 - 9:25)
um so that's exciting uh you the code (9:22 - 9:30)
should be redeemable until July 3rd uh I (9:25 - 9:32)
believe that (9:30 - 9:33)
well it will start with the broadcast (9:32 - 9:35)
starts so I actually don't know off the (9:33 - 9:37)
top of my head if broadcast for that (9:35 - 9:39)
event is starting on Thursday or Friday (9:37 - 9:40)
I (9:39 - 9:43)
I would assume Friday (9:40 - 9:44)
um usually Thursday is just like sign (9:43 - 9:48)
ups and yeah some other stuff (9:44 - 9:48)
so exciting I love that the first (9:48 - 9:54)
comment on the Tweet is literally how (9:51 - 9:56)
about a code for something and go and (9:54 - 9:58)
unite also like (9:56 - 10:00)
here's two free things hey but what (9:58 - 10:02)
about me (10:00 - 10:04)
different games different sets of (10:02 - 10:06)
players yeah I know (10:04 - 10:08)
and I mean guys they could give a (10:06 - 10:11)
costume they could they won't yeah (10:08 - 10:13)
they'll give you a seven day free trial (10:11 - 10:16)
for Pikachu (10:13 - 10:16)
laughs (10:18 - 10:21)
what did they do they gave away the (10:19 - 10:23)
world's shirt last year didn't they and (10:21 - 10:26)
yeah yeah (10:23 - 10:30)
I remember I remember getting off my my (10:26 - 10:32)
seven hour flight getting to the hotel (10:30 - 10:35)
and immediately making graphics for like (10:32 - 10:38)
all of these (10:35 - 10:38)
there was the whole world's event in go (10:41 - 10:45)
last year too and that was actually a (10:43 - 10:46)
really good event that was probably the (10:45 - 10:48)
closest they've gotten because they did (10:46 - 10:50)
the whole event was made up of spawns of (10:48 - 10:52)
Pokemon that are generally or at least (10:50 - 10:55)
at the time were really good in PvP (10:52 - 10:59)
yes yeah I remember that (10:55 - 10:59)
speaking of uh Sarah and violet just (11:01 - 11:06)
before we change topics too far away (11:03 - 11:11)
a chestnut returned I was I was curious (11:06 - 11:14)
here here's how here's how the Seven (11:11 - 11:16)
Star raids work on Twitch (11:14 - 11:18)
at least for me this is very like you (11:16 - 11:19)
know (11:18 - 11:22)
twitch is uh its own little nutshell of (11:19 - 11:25)
a community but usually when a new Seven (11:22 - 11:27)
Star raid comes out (11:25 - 11:31)
everyone is there on day one like the (11:27 - 11:33)
fear of missing out kicks in like that (11:31 - 11:37)
Thursday night we are popping we got we (11:33 - 11:39)
got hundreds of people and then the next (11:37 - 11:41)
day uh (11:39 - 11:44)
feels more like a normal stream (11:41 - 11:46)
uh people are still like you know it's (11:44 - 11:48)
Friday night at that point people are (11:46 - 11:49)
still getting in (11:48 - 11:51)
um and then I don't really stream on the (11:49 - 11:53)
weekend so I'm I'm sure it would be even (11:51 - 11:55)
lighter but the following week it's like (11:53 - 11:57)
that that raid never happened it's like (11:55 - 12:00)
very normal like maybe there's like one (11:57 - 12:01)
or two people that are like I haven't (12:00 - 12:03)
done Chestnut so I was curious because (12:01 - 12:06)
Chestnut came out during breath tears of (12:03 - 12:09)
the kingdom and then I saw a bunch of (12:06 - 12:10)
people be like when is it coming back I (12:09 - 12:14)
missed it uh no people still don't they (12:10 - 12:16)
didn't care about Chestnut (12:14 - 12:18)
the second time around (12:16 - 12:21)
that was like a month delayed very (12:18 - 12:23)
normal stream (12:21 - 12:25)
you know a couple few of us in there I (12:23 - 12:28)
was there getting that chest not (12:25 - 12:30)
it's a it it's a (12:28 - 12:32)
uh you know it was pretty (12:30 - 12:33)
straightforward with people's Pokemon (12:32 - 12:35)
selections and everyone kind of knew (12:33 - 12:37)
what they were doing but still fun I (12:35 - 12:39)
don't know I still I still have a great (12:37 - 12:42)
time doing raids minus getting stuck or (12:39 - 12:47)
[Laughter] (12:42 - 12:48)
covered though (12:47 - 12:51)
um because I I have uh I have the I have (12:48 - 12:53)
the privilege of having community so (12:51 - 12:54)
it's usually pretty easy to get people (12:53 - 12:56)
to join my raids and obviously it's way (12:54 - 12:59)
easier when you have IRL people (12:56 - 13:01)
um instead of the CPUs unless you hit (12:59 - 13:03)
like that Arcanine CPU which is probably (13:01 - 13:06)
the best one that our belief our (13:03 - 13:07)
believer or whatever that that's the (13:06 - 13:09)
worst one (13:07 - 13:11)
um (13:09 - 13:11)
is it worse than Martin in the soul Rock (13:11 - 13:17)
ah (13:15 - 13:17)
ah yes now come on Martin Martin Martin (13:17 - 13:24)
was iconic (13:21 - 13:26)
you're just this enough time hasn't (13:24 - 13:29)
passed to make this Arc iconic I would (13:26 - 13:31)
argue (13:29 - 13:33)
what was I gonna say oh yeah (13:31 - 13:34)
um (13:33 - 13:37)
I was curious what like the random raids (13:34 - 13:40)
look like not like just going in with (13:37 - 13:43)
NPCs but like going like I've done (13:40 - 13:46)
random raids for the seven star and you (13:43 - 13:48)
always get that weird player that's like (13:46 - 13:51)
you do the Italian but they're bringing (13:48 - 13:53)
the intelli in so you're like will you (13:51 - 13:55)
clearly beat it that's why you're here (13:53 - 13:57)
but why are you bringing this they're (13:55 - 13:59)
like oh I finished Chestnut I'm gonna (13:57 - 14:01)
bring chest I don't understand I don't (13:59 - 14:04)
understand that logic but I was like I (14:01 - 14:06)
want to do like random six star raids (14:04 - 14:08)
mostly because I want to see what (14:06 - 14:10)
players are bringing but also they're (14:08 - 14:12)
not technically as hard as Seven Star (14:10 - 14:15)
but also chance of urban mystica (14:12 - 14:19)
and it it wasn't even the players that (14:15 - 14:22)
drove me insane even though (14:19 - 14:25)
watching two iron hands both belly drum (14:22 - 14:27)
and wild charge and then proceed to (14:25 - 14:30)
knock themselves out was what I expected (14:27 - 14:33)
the thing that drove me crazy was that (14:30 - 14:36)
you ultimately have to fail (14:33 - 14:39)
to get into two raids before you can get (14:36 - 14:41)
into a raid like you'll click on the (14:39 - 14:44)
raid and it will think forever and it'll (14:41 - 14:46)
say connecting connecting connecting and (14:44 - 14:48)
then we'll say connection fail but you (14:46 - 14:50)
can't refresh that (14:48 - 14:52)
terrible looking bulletin board it looks (14:50 - 14:55)
so tacky and bad (14:52 - 14:58)
um and then it reminds me of when like (14:55 - 15:01)
apple was very into qmorphism which is (14:58 - 15:03)
it which is like making things look like (15:01 - 15:04)
what the thing is so like when you like (15:03 - 15:06)
open the notepad app it like had like (15:04 - 15:09)
the little like Frills and edges and the (15:06 - 15:12)
stuff it's very skeemorphic but then you (15:09 - 15:13)
have to like because you can't refresh (15:12 - 15:15)
the bulletin board you have to just (15:13 - 15:17)
click on something else and because (15:15 - 15:19)
you've sat in that first raid for so (15:17 - 15:21)
long everything else there is already (15:19 - 15:25)
like yep it's all outdated so you have (15:21 - 15:27)
to sit in a second one and then wait for (15:25 - 15:28)
that one to go like connecting (15:27 - 15:30)
connecting connecting and then fail out (15:28 - 15:32)
and then as soon as that one fails out (15:30 - 15:34)
you can hit X to refresh and then you (15:32 - 15:35)
have to like (15:34 - 15:37)
like desperately pick one of the eight (15:35 - 15:39)
as fast as possible so it doesn't like (15:37 - 15:41)
so you don't go through this cycle again (15:39 - 15:44)
so (15:41 - 15:44)
six star raids if it didn't take (15:46 - 15:53)
six full minutes to get into even one of (15:49 - 15:57)
them it is well I (15:53 - 15:58)
I'm thinking I don't know how they fix (15:57 - 16:01)
it because (15:58 - 16:02)
when it shows up (16:01 - 16:06)
and you click into it it searches to (16:02 - 16:09)
find you a raid that matches what you (16:06 - 16:11)
picked because you're not like it's not (16:09 - 16:12)
like sword and shields wycom where (16:11 - 16:14)
you're like you saw a person's name they (16:12 - 16:16)
had something up somebody put it up you (16:14 - 16:18)
clicked at it and it's desperately if (16:16 - 16:21)
that one's full trying to find you one (16:18 - 16:25)
that matches it which (16:21 - 16:28)
I would argue they wait too long for (16:25 - 16:29)
that result like if the person that (16:28 - 16:31)
filled up and you clicked at it and it's (16:29 - 16:34)
immediately full just end it right there (16:31 - 16:36)
stop searching the world (16:34 - 16:38)
to try to find another matching one (16:36 - 16:40)
especially on six stars it's like it was (16:38 - 16:43)
rare that that person found that one (16:40 - 16:49)
there might be another I doubt it (16:43 - 16:53)
end it the randomized button is actually (16:49 - 16:54)
the most useful if you're trying to get (16:53 - 16:56)
into into a raid through that screen (16:54 - 16:59)
without a code yeah yeah but you don't (16:56 - 17:00)
get to pick six star unfortunately yeah (16:59 - 17:03)
exactly and you get thrown into the (17:00 - 17:06)
wildest Things (17:03 - 17:06)
I like the force commitment I like being (17:10 - 17:17)
like you you spot you spun a slot (17:14 - 17:19)
machine and you're getting like a grass (17:17 - 17:22)
stable eye right now (17:19 - 17:24)
um I like that I just wish that random (17:22 - 17:26)
thing was like broken down into like I (17:24 - 17:29)
just want a random six star raids (17:26 - 17:31)
um that would be a little bit better but (17:29 - 17:33)
yeah like (17:31 - 17:35)
I I can't believe three and a half years (17:33 - 17:39)
later I'm like why come was kind of (17:35 - 17:41)
better (17:39 - 17:41)
to a good like raid system though like (17:43 - 17:47)
if I could just pick like give me random (17:45 - 17:52)
six close to an okay raid system if I if (17:47 - 17:55)
I could see what the levels are of the (17:52 - 17:58)
Pokemon coming in if I could if I could (17:55 - 18:02)
just at least change my held item of My (17:58 - 18:05)
Pokemon like it like in the waiting (18:02 - 18:07)
screen that would be (18:05 - 18:10)
that would be great or or or something (18:07 - 18:11)
also like (18:10 - 18:13)
just a side note doing it with randoms (18:11 - 18:16)
the amount of like the level 100 doesn't (18:13 - 18:18)
seem to be like a problem like almost (18:16 - 18:20)
everyone is level 100 shout out to the (18:18 - 18:22)
dude that was 97 that was like kind of (18:20 - 18:25)
funny I'm not exactly commitment (18:22 - 18:28)
teaches you're so close maybe this rate (18:25 - 18:30)
is the one that's getting you to a (18:28 - 18:32)
hundred but like (18:30 - 18:34)
the thing that was actually shocking is (18:32 - 18:36)
I'm clicking on random people is just no (18:34 - 18:38)
one has Health items (18:36 - 18:39)
like (18:38 - 18:41)
even putting like a miracle seat on your (18:39 - 18:45)
grass Pokemon is so good I mean I will (18:41 - 18:47)
freely admit that I do tend to never to (18:45 - 18:50)
put items on my Pokemon because I forget (18:47 - 18:54)
I'm like oh right that's a thing yeah (18:50 - 18:56)
right like there's three different (18:54 - 18:59)
stores that sell wild items some of the (18:56 - 19:02)
holidays are kind of expensive yeah (18:59 - 19:04)
um you have to like know which store (19:02 - 19:06)
you're going to and then you have to (19:04 - 19:08)
find the like I can never find the one (19:06 - 19:11)
what's the main City's name (19:08 - 19:11)
I can never find it I know where it is I (19:11 - 19:17)
go to that entrance and I'm still (19:15 - 19:18)
driving around like (19:17 - 19:22)
why can't I find the bagel shop I just (19:18 - 19:25)
want a churro (19:22 - 19:25)
um (19:26 - 19:29)
I don't know I I guess I bring up the (19:27 - 19:30)
right stuff a lot because I really (19:29 - 19:33)
really like it I just think of how many (19:30 - 19:35)
like slight tweaks they can do to make (19:33 - 19:38)
it better (19:35 - 19:38)
on the side of (19:38 - 19:42)
safety way too much (19:42 - 19:47)
like (19:45 - 19:49)
come on (19:47 - 19:51)
it's not but it's not even like safety (19:49 - 19:53)
with like the random thing like they (19:51 - 19:55)
have the random button there just make (19:53 - 19:58)
another random button and have like this (19:55 - 20:01)
one be like four to five star raids and (19:58 - 20:03)
then this one would be six star like or (20:01 - 20:05)
three I think I think the random will (20:03 - 20:07)
take you to three to three to six star (20:05 - 20:09)
raids (20:07 - 20:11)
there's a very bending depending on your (20:09 - 20:13)
level like what's on there no no it's (20:11 - 20:15)
completely random (20:13 - 20:17)
So like um because when you beat the (20:15 - 20:19)
game you can't see one or two star raids (20:17 - 20:21)
anymore so the random will be like three (20:19 - 20:23)
four five or six but can you do the (20:21 - 20:26)
random before you beat the game oh yeah (20:23 - 20:28)
I would assume so I would assume that (20:26 - 20:32)
you would get one two three I don't know (20:28 - 20:38)
when four or five unlocking story mode (20:32 - 20:38)
but (20:40 - 20:44)
yeah just showing like I think eight (20:42 - 20:46)
Pokemon and then being like I can't get (20:44 - 20:49)
into any of these until I just wait for (20:46 - 20:51)
it to refresh yeah (20:49 - 20:54)
force it to do that that's the other (20:51 - 20:56)
thing I'm like why can't I just have the (20:54 - 20:59)
x button (20:56 - 21:02)
the X will show up (20:59 - 21:05)
after you fail too I think it's after a (21:02 - 21:06)
certain amount of time it's after a (21:05 - 21:09)
certain amount of time (21:06 - 21:09)
I don't know what the time limit was for (21:11 - 21:15)
sword and shield I felt like maybe (21:13 - 21:17)
there's a placebo Insurgent Shield where (21:15 - 21:19)
if I kept scrolling down over and over (21:17 - 21:21)
if I kept like scrolling and moving it (21:19 - 21:23)
would be like okay we're refreshing but (21:21 - 21:27)
I mean so Placebo was was to do the (21:23 - 21:28)
coded (21:27 - 21:31)
uh uh card changer because it would (21:28 - 21:33)
refresh faster if you're actively trying (21:31 - 21:35)
to do something (21:33 - 21:37)
so you'd put in let's exchange cards but (21:35 - 21:39)
you put in a random link code and the (21:37 - 21:42)
system was like oh I'll keep checking (21:39 - 21:44)
and so it would refresh the y-com more (21:42 - 21:47)
and then you would try to quickly kill (21:44 - 21:49)
your thing to go into the one before it (21:47 - 21:51)
failed up because (21:49 - 21:53)
it was a random if it was popular it's (21:51 - 21:56)
like I gotta do this fast yeah they I (21:53 - 21:59)
don't know I don't (21:56 - 21:59)
I did do five six star raids and I got (21:59 - 22:05)
three Urban mysticas from him so (22:02 - 22:10)
can't complain with that good old HMS (22:05 - 22:10)
uh (22:11 - 22:17)
uh speaking of complaining they released (22:13 - 22:20)
the uh Team Rocket collection on Pokemon (22:17 - 22:21)
Center (22:20 - 22:24)
and (22:21 - 22:28)
they did say 30 items there there are (22:24 - 22:31)
indeed 30 items here uh (22:28 - 22:34)
before we get to said items (22:31 - 22:37)
great photography (22:34 - 22:40)
great Market they had a whole Twitter (22:37 - 22:43)
thing they had uh (22:40 - 22:45)
they were they were instagramming they (22:43 - 22:47)
were tweeting they got a whole thing on (22:45 - 22:50)
their their their website (22:47 - 22:55)
I'm I'm a bit confused because if you've (22:50 - 22:56)
been listening to the show for at least (22:55 - 22:58)
two episodes you know that we've talked (22:56 - 23:00)
about the (22:58 - 23:03)
we cannot delay anything (23:00 - 23:06)
Pokemon motto because we have to keep (23:03 - 23:08)
everything lined up (23:06 - 23:10)
uh our games have to line up with the (23:08 - 23:12)
anime that has to line up with the card (23:10 - 23:13)
game that has to line up with our (23:12 - 23:16)
spin-offs that have to line up this (23:13 - 23:19)
lines up with nothing (23:16 - 23:22)
it's just so like they were like ah you (23:19 - 23:24)
can watch the Mewtwo movie now on (23:22 - 23:26)
Pokemon TV and here are like the 10 best (23:24 - 23:28)
Giovanni episodes and it's like you (23:26 - 23:30)
could have done that in anything time (23:28 - 23:34)
yeah I guess maybe it slightly lines up (23:30 - 23:36)
with like Team Rocket weekends and (23:34 - 23:38)
Pokemon go (23:36 - 23:42)
not really but like that would make more (23:38 - 23:43)
sense if they were like hey we added (23:42 - 23:45)
like two new outfits in Pokemon go and (23:43 - 23:46)
here's (23:45 - 23:51)
but that why isn't that a thing (23:46 - 23:51)
and Okay so (23:52 - 23:57)
okay so I I I immediately went to (23:54 - 23:59)
pokemoncenter.com I have a couple gift (23:57 - 24:01)
cards Pokemon center.com don't know what (23:59 - 24:03)
to spend them on I was like I could use (24:01 - 24:07)
a new hoodie what what do we got (24:03 - 24:10)
uh and I immediately saw that almost (24:07 - 24:13)
everything in this collection is is like (24:10 - 24:16)
pushing a hundred dollars easy (24:13 - 24:19)
and so I click on something (24:16 - 24:20)
here I'll click on it right now I'll (24:19 - 24:23)
click on this Team Rocket HQ (24:20 - 24:26)
collection white fleece pullover hoodie (24:23 - 24:29)
adult 99 now I would never buy a white (24:26 - 24:31)
hoodie because that would instantly be (24:29 - 24:34)
uh stained in about 10 seconds uh and (24:31 - 24:36)
I'm like scrolling down and I'm like oh (24:34 - 24:38)
a hundred dollars who did they partner (24:36 - 24:42)
with like what designer brand am I (24:38 - 24:45)
paying for here (24:42 - 24:47)
um or at least like with some designer (24:45 - 24:48)
Brands you could be like well I know (24:47 - 24:53)
that's a good quality it's uh so and so (24:48 - 24:56)
there's nothing here there's no this (24:53 - 24:59)
stuff is more expensive than the Puma (24:56 - 25:02)
stuff that they put on and I'm not (24:59 - 25:04)
saying Puma is like known for amazing (25:02 - 25:06)
quality there might be some people who (25:04 - 25:08)
love Puma out there but like (25:06 - 25:11)
you expect that to be expensive because (25:08 - 25:12)
it's you got the Pokemon tax and then (25:11 - 25:14)
you got the Puma tax (25:12 - 25:16)
this is just (25:14 - 25:20)
this is just Pokemon tags to be fair a (25:16 - 25:23)
lot of Pokemon Center clothing is really (25:20 - 25:24)
high quality I have been pleasantly (25:23 - 25:26)
surprised by a lot of the things I've (25:24 - 25:29)
ordered from there but these aren't good (25:26 - 25:32)
pieces like these are barely Pokemon (25:29 - 25:36)
this collection is so boring (25:32 - 25:41)
and so poorly designed it's it it like (25:36 - 25:44)
there's not one piece in here that's (25:41 - 25:47)
like oh that's an interesting take I (25:44 - 25:48)
didn't expect you to do that it is (25:47 - 25:51)
literally a bunch of plain clothing with (25:48 - 25:56)
an r on it in various sizes there are (25:51 - 25:59)
bet they're these designs like I was (25:56 - 26:02)
like oh cool I could find almost all of (25:59 - 26:06)
these on Redbubble for the last 10 years (26:02 - 26:08)
okay but let's not use Redbubble they (26:06 - 26:10)
they steal people's art and then I mean (26:08 - 26:12)
correct but I'm saying if you're gonna (26:10 - 26:14)
make a new collection that is your own (26:12 - 26:16)
personal collection I shouldn't have (26:14 - 26:17)
been seeing it (26:16 - 26:21)
on an off-brand stolen website for 10 (26:17 - 26:22)
years now (26:21 - 26:24)
and none of it's rainbow rocket like one (26:22 - 26:26)
piece you can put one piece rainbow (26:24 - 26:28)
rocket in here yeah the rainbow rocket (26:26 - 26:29)
stuff was (26:28 - 26:31)
I mean the rainbow rocket stuff is the (26:29 - 26:33)
same as Team Rocket it's just the r has (26:31 - 26:35)
like rainbow the r has like it's a (26:33 - 26:38)
rainbow around it right nah well it (26:35 - 26:40)
depends it depends and Pokemon go (26:38 - 26:43)
sometimes a rainbow through yeah yeah (26:40 - 26:45)
um I mean even Pokemon go has rainbow (26:43 - 26:47)
rides right (26:45 - 26:48)
foreign (26:47 - 26:52)
yeah I mean like some of the stuff the r (26:48 - 26:54)
makes sense right like (26:52 - 26:56)
you know throw our r on the hat that (26:54 - 26:58)
makes sense I'm not sure what else (26:56 - 26:59)
you're gonna do (26:58 - 27:01)
throw an r on the socks yeah sure that (26:59 - 27:02)
makes sense (27:01 - 27:05)
like I I do think the white hoodie with (27:02 - 27:07)
the r is really clean I like the little (27:05 - 27:10)
red Silhouettes uh you get the little (27:07 - 27:12)
like drawstrings on the sleeves (27:10 - 27:13)
like (27:12 - 27:15)
I don't mind that there is some simple (27:13 - 27:19)
stuff here but like everything is the (27:15 - 27:21)
same it's also kind of weird like that (27:19 - 27:23)
some of the choices they made like the (27:21 - 27:24)
hoodies (27:23 - 27:28)
where they made the r match the color so (27:24 - 27:31)
like on the white hoodie the r is white (27:28 - 27:33)
and on the red hoodie the r is red which (27:31 - 27:37)
makes it harder to see (27:33 - 27:37)
the white one I admit is a little bit (27:37 - 27:44)
cool but everything else the white The (27:41 - 27:46)
All White and the all black ones are (27:44 - 27:48)
subtle enough to be kind of kind of neat (27:46 - 27:50)
but when everything is just a normal (27:48 - 27:52)
piece of clothing with a red ass slapped (27:50 - 27:56)
onto it yeah or almost everything I mean (27:52 - 27:58)
I did cosplay when I was in Middle (27:56 - 28:00)
School I made shirts where I printed out (27:58 - 28:02)
a thing on paper that you could then (28:00 - 28:04)
just iron onto the shirt this looks like (28:02 - 28:07)
those yes it does it it looks like (28:04 - 28:09)
decals and I'm sure it's higher quality (28:07 - 28:11)
I am sure these would last through the (28:09 - 28:14)
wash I'm pretty sure Pokemon Center (28:11 - 28:15)
seems to be doing pretty well with their (28:14 - 28:18)
quality but I I mean I would question (28:15 - 28:21)
that on is is the giant ours because (28:18 - 28:24)
they're so big and so heavily printed (28:21 - 28:28)
and so even in the pictures they look so (28:24 - 28:31)
plasticky like there's no way that's not (28:28 - 28:34)
cracking yeah that's fair like the the (28:31 - 28:37)
129 jacket (28:34 - 28:40)
looks looks great (28:37 - 28:41)
um (28:40 - 28:46)
but it's 129 jacket like like the black (28:41 - 28:48)
one with like the red on the red tips (28:46 - 28:50)
and the the r doesn't look like it's (28:48 - 28:51)
going to wash off because it looks like (28:50 - 28:53)
it's actually (28:51 - 28:57)
not just the iron on (28:53 - 28:58)
um and then like the like when I look at (28:57 - 29:00)
the group picture of like the four (28:58 - 29:03)
adults all decked out in Team Rocket (29:00 - 29:06)
stuff I'm like man that looks good (29:03 - 29:09)
it looks very like it does capture that (29:06 - 29:11)
street wear Vibe they're going for but (29:09 - 29:16)
like their whole outfit is like 500 (29:11 - 29:16)
like you you get the you get like the (29:17 - 29:22)
shirt and then like the vest and then (29:20 - 29:23)
the the pants and then the socks and (29:22 - 29:25)
you're like (29:23 - 29:29)
[Laughter] (29:25 - 29:29)
broke trying to like get everything here (29:29 - 29:35)
yeah (29:33 - 29:37)
and just like people (29:35 - 29:40)
I just like (29:37 - 29:42)
anorak jackets are are a very specific (29:40 - 29:45)
popular thing and depending on the brand (29:42 - 29:48)
but even if like if you go to like uh (29:45 - 29:51)
Columbia store to get an anorexic (29:48 - 29:53)
Colombia is a decent brand probably the (29:51 - 29:54)
same quality that you get from the (29:53 - 29:57)
Pokemon Center that jacket's about sixty (29:54 - 29:58)
dollars (29:57 - 30:02)
so this is a this is twice the price to (29:58 - 30:05)
have an r on it (30:02 - 30:05)
like (30:06 - 30:11)
even hey an r and a little tag near the (30:08 - 30:13)
bottom that has a little Pokeball on it (30:11 - 30:15)
that says Pokemon Center like even if (30:13 - 30:17)
you want to say like okay maybe it's (30:15 - 30:20)
super good quality and it's it's (30:17 - 30:22)
you know (30:20 - 30:25)
waterproof and you know all the things (30:22 - 30:27)
even those jackets are ninety dollars (30:25 - 30:32)
like the prices they have (30:27 - 30:32)
are really expensive yeah even I think I (30:32 - 30:39)
feel like even for Pokemon tax when I (30:37 - 30:43)
was looking at them I'm like these are (30:39 - 30:46)
really expensive (30:43 - 30:50)
for not great designs for designs that (30:46 - 30:51)
felt like (30:50 - 30:55)
the intern was rushed (30:51 - 30:57)
I mean I get the style they're going for (30:55 - 30:59)
but as someone who keeps waiting to see (30:57 - 31:01)
when they make things on Pokemon Center (30:59 - 31:03)
that hopefully someday will actually be (31:01 - 31:06)
as stylized Pokemon thing and not just (31:03 - 31:08)
the picture of the Pokemon slapped on a (31:06 - 31:10)
shirt this is like the other direction (31:08 - 31:12)
they just slapped an r on a shirt yeah (31:10 - 31:16)
yeah I mean I will say like I bought the (31:12 - 31:17)
Roselia jacket which actually I think (31:16 - 31:19)
was really well designed and well yeah (31:17 - 31:21)
that one was nice (31:19 - 31:26)
um and was expensive but I I feel like (31:21 - 31:28)
for what I got (31:26 - 31:33)
it it the Pokemon text was in line with (31:28 - 31:38)
what what was expected like (31:33 - 31:38)
59 (31:39 - 31:42)
80 for a long sleeve (31:42 - 31:49)
T-shirt with an r on it well it's like (31:46 - 31:51)
uh (31:49 - 31:54)
it's like a pat it's like a I don't know (31:51 - 31:56)
what to call it that if it's a textured (31:54 - 31:58)
shirt if you look at it it's just not (31:56 - 31:59)
like it (31:58 - 32:01)
oh yeah (31:59 - 32:03)
but (32:01 - 32:05)
I don't know what the waffle yeah it's (32:03 - 32:08)
some some sort of waffle like but even (32:05 - 32:11)
then like I I buy those types of shirts (32:08 - 32:13)
for everyday wear and they are thirty (32:11 - 32:15)
dollars yeah yeah yeah yeah maybe you (32:13 - 32:16)
probably get like a waffle shirt at (32:15 - 32:21)
Target for yeah 30 bucks Maybe 35. (32:16 - 32:25)
it's also weird like the patch is sewn (32:21 - 32:28)
on it is not a waffle pattern the patch (32:25 - 32:30)
is just a patch that they sewed on and (32:28 - 32:32)
you you know (32:30 - 32:34)
it all feels I mean it looks good that (32:32 - 32:36)
that white waffle shirt looks good with (32:34 - 32:38)
that vest that vest is a hundred and ten (32:36 - 32:40)
dollars though I've never seen a vest be (32:38 - 32:44)
a hunt like maybe it may be maybe maybe (32:40 - 32:46)
at like some like actual like outdoor (32:44 - 32:48)
stores but like (32:46 - 32:51)
gosh even Target's only charging like (32:48 - 32:53)
thirty dollars for event yeah maybe (32:51 - 32:54)
maybe the best (32:53 - 32:57)
woman maybe vests have gone up in prices (32:54 - 33:00)
I mean best had another comeback about (32:57 - 33:02)
10 years ago (33:00 - 33:04)
but not this price wise and like cropped (33:02 - 33:07)
hoodies they're cute but again a cropped (33:04 - 33:10)
hoodie does not cost that much money (33:07 - 33:11)
it just feels (33:10 - 33:15)
I think the problem is for us much (33:11 - 33:18)
hype and advertising that they put into (33:15 - 33:20)
it when you got to the actual collection (33:18 - 33:25)
and saw how bland it was and how (33:20 - 33:29)
out of sync their pricing is it's really (33:25 - 33:32)
a disappointing experience it's just (33:29 - 33:36)
like if this had been (33:32 - 33:36)
a third the price I I think they've been (33:36 - 33:40)
like oh that's cool like I can see those (33:38 - 33:43)
prices I I think the price (33:40 - 33:45)
even half the price (33:43 - 33:48)
would make more sense yeah (33:45 - 33:50)
um but like even there's been a third (33:48 - 33:51)
person I think more people would have (33:50 - 33:54)
been willing to forgive how sort of just (33:51 - 33:57)
like just slap an r on it it is (33:54 - 34:00)
um and like (33:57 - 34:00)
I mean I saw some people who were very (34:00 - 34:07)
excited about one or two pieces until (34:03 - 34:10)
they saw the price because there are a (34:07 - 34:12)
lot of people a lot of the gays are into (34:10 - 34:14)
the cropped hoodies another property (34:12 - 34:16)
looks great and they're like they're (34:14 - 34:18)
gorgeous eight dollars it's eighty (34:16 - 34:21)
dollars (34:18 - 34:23)
eighty dollars for a crop hoodie with an (34:21 - 34:25)
r on it I mean that is where that (34:23 - 34:28)
conversation breaks down every time is (34:25 - 34:31)
the price I think the price is just and (34:28 - 34:34)
I think it's also telling that (34:31 - 34:35)
usually when we come into the show (34:34 - 34:37)
things are sold out like the popular (34:35 - 34:39)
items and there's not a single thing (34:37 - 34:41)
sold out on this (34:39 - 34:43)
the the Puma hoodie (34:41 - 34:46)
the I've worn that one on the show it's (34:44 - 34:48)
the Blastoise one which is just like the (34:46 - 34:51)
Ken tsukumori Blastoise art with the (34:48 - 34:54)
word puma next to it yeah and we were (34:51 - 34:56)
also the lazy design but sure uh I I I (34:54 - 34:59)
had a gift card from the I did not pay (34:56 - 35:00)
well I paid for a little bit of the (34:59 - 35:03)
hoodie but the Pokemon company sent me a (35:00 - 35:04)
gift card so I was like I'll use it for (35:03 - 35:06)
the Puma hurdy because I'm not gonna (35:04 - 35:07)
spend eighty dollars so I'm looking at (35:06 - 35:10)
it right now the Puma hoodie is eighty (35:07 - 35:12)
dollars it is blue there's a Blastoise (35:10 - 35:13)
on it is the same price as the Team (35:12 - 35:15)
Rocket crop hoodie not the the other (35:13 - 35:17)
hoodies are a hundred yeah (35:15 - 35:19)
um (35:17 - 35:22)
and it's it's like an okay hoodie it is (35:19 - 35:25)
not nearly the best hoodie I I own it I (35:22 - 35:26)
feel like the arms could be a little bit (35:25 - 35:28)
longer (35:26 - 35:29)
um (35:28 - 35:31)
like it (35:29 - 35:34)
doesn't feel more high quality than a (35:31 - 35:36)
bunch of other hoodies I have right like (35:34 - 35:37)
I know there's different weights and (35:36 - 35:38)
hoodies like you can have a pretty thin (35:37 - 35:40)
hoodie or a pretty like heavy hoodie (35:38 - 35:42)
it's like a medium-sized hoodie (35:40 - 35:46)
um but like when I bought it I was like (35:42 - 35:46)
I have a gift card but two like I'm (35:46 - 35:53)
curious what the quality of a the Puma (35:50 - 35:55)
what like what is Puma bringing to this (35:53 - 35:56)
and it's like it's just it's an okay (35:55 - 35:58)
hoodie like yeah I get why it's 80 bucks (35:56 - 36:00)
you have Pokemon text and you have Puma (35:58 - 36:01)
tax (36:00 - 36:03)
this is why I was like so dumbfounded (36:01 - 36:05)
with the team rocket stuff because I'm (36:03 - 36:08)
like desperately looking of like (36:05 - 36:10)
why why is the price where did where is (36:08 - 36:12)
the price increase here (36:10 - 36:16)
yeah like like why are the like I think (36:12 - 36:18)
to me a crop hoodie should probably be (36:16 - 36:20)
like 50 bucks (36:18 - 36:22)
yeah and then like the normal the (36:20 - 36:25)
non-crops should be like 60 and even 50 (36:22 - 36:27)
and 60 dollars (36:25 - 36:29)
still seems like a lot yeah but like (36:27 - 36:31)
you're like ah Pokemon text (36:29 - 36:35)
I mean I would be very curious how high (36:31 - 36:37)
quality these are once someone gets (36:35 - 36:39)
their hands on them just because (36:37 - 36:42)
these are so expensive (36:39 - 36:44)
oh you know what we talked about last (36:42 - 36:47)
week was the the other hoodies (36:44 - 36:48)
um the (36:47 - 36:54)
the TCG yeah I I so I had uh the Pokemon (36:48 - 36:57)
company sent me they sent me a bunch of (36:54 - 36:59)
gift cards for Christmas I completely (36:57 - 37:00)
forgot about them so I was like okay (36:59 - 37:03)
I'll uh I guess I'll order one of these (37:00 - 37:06)
one of these hoodies so I I you know I (37:03 - 37:09)
added some stuff to my cart I attached (37:06 - 37:11)
the the gift card one of them was the (37:09 - 37:13)
TCG hoodie I'm looking I'm trying to (37:11 - 37:15)
look up it up right now (37:13 - 37:17)
um even if those pennies are 34.99 yeah (37:15 - 37:20)
they're 35 35 dollars (37:17 - 37:23)
it is a it actually blew me away of how (37:20 - 37:26)
great quality it was it actually to me (37:23 - 37:28)
is better than the Puma hoodie in the (37:26 - 37:31)
way it fits uh and it's like thickness (37:28 - 37:34)
the only thing that is bad about the (37:31 - 37:37)
also with the the TCG live hoodie you (37:34 - 37:40)
get like free digital packs right you (37:37 - 37:42)
get like nine free digital packs what do (37:40 - 37:44)
you get with rocket you're creating your (37:42 - 37:45)
Pokemon stolen that's what you're (37:44 - 37:47)
getting so the only thing I don't like (37:45 - 37:49)
about the Pokemon Trading Card Game (37:47 - 37:51)
hoodie is the little Pokeball symbol (37:49 - 37:56)
that they have it's like plasticky oh is (37:51 - 37:57)
that the only bit (37:56 - 38:00)
yeah so like though it's it's like blue (37:57 - 38:04)
white blue black like that's all cloth (38:00 - 38:06)
um and then a little Pokeball at the top (38:04 - 38:08)
is is kind of like a plasticky emblem (38:06 - 38:10)
yeah I mean that's what most of the R's (38:08 - 38:13)
on the team rocket stuff yeah (38:10 - 38:13)
so like I don't I don't like love that (38:13 - 38:18)
part uh but it is a pretty clean hoodie (38:15 - 38:20)
like it's I think you chose the only one (38:18 - 38:23)
that has an actual good color though you (38:20 - 38:24)
got the blue one the red and the yellow (38:23 - 38:27)
are both really bright (38:24 - 38:29)
that after I saw you got the blue one I (38:27 - 38:30)
went and looked at the red one because (38:29 - 38:32)
the blue one actually looks really good (38:30 - 38:34)
in person but the red is just such a (38:32 - 38:36)
bright red (38:34 - 38:39)
yellow is is something else too yellow (38:36 - 38:41)
Is My Jam I you know you know I would (38:39 - 38:43)
wear that though except for the fact (38:41 - 38:45)
that it's a hoodie yeah you know just (38:43 - 38:47)
take a pair of scissors to it make it (38:45 - 38:48)
make it a deep V (38:47 - 38:52)
[Laughter] (38:48 - 38:54)
yeah it's just like literally looking at (38:52 - 38:57)
these side by side Pokemon Trading Card (38:54 - 39:00)
Game Live red pull over hoodie adult 35 (38:57 - 39:02)
Team Rocket high quality collection (39:00 - 39:05)
white fleece pullover hoodie 99 it's (39:02 - 39:09)
just yeah it's it's just a little a (39:05 - 39:11)
little weird (39:09 - 39:14)
yeah I just um I would love to have one (39:11 - 39:17)
I would love to as somebody who only (39:14 - 39:19)
wears hoodies is why I don't buy like (39:17 - 39:21)
T-shirts because I just have like white (39:19 - 39:22)
t-shirts on under this because I've just (39:21 - 39:26)
always have a hoodie on or a jacket on (39:22 - 39:28)
you'll never see my t-shirt (39:26 - 39:30)
I feel like I have a pretty good hoodie (39:28 - 39:32)
now I have my knowledge of hoodies I (39:30 - 39:34)
feel like it's pretty okay so I would (39:32 - 39:37)
love to be like yes I can confidently (39:34 - 39:38)
say for a hundred dollars it is (39:37 - 39:41)
expensive but you're getting some value (39:38 - 39:43)
here but these pictures are not doing it (39:41 - 39:45)
justice no (39:43 - 39:50)
I mean I I don't have (39:45 - 39:50)
a a stronger scent like Pokemon (39:50 - 39:57)
Center clothing is good quality these (39:54 - 39:59)
don't look like they are of a high like (39:57 - 40:01)
they went out for a higher quality for (39:59 - 40:03)
these right like yeah these look like (40:01 - 40:04)
the same (40:03 - 40:07)
34.99 hoodie quality just with Team (40:04 - 40:11)
Rocket stuff and three times the price (40:07 - 40:14)
for no reason (40:11 - 40:14)
the no reason being like this is also (40:14 - 40:19)
not matching anything outside of the (40:16 - 40:21)
Pokemon Center no there's no (40:19 - 40:23)
collaboration here it's not even like a (40:21 - 40:24)
limited if they were like hey we only (40:23 - 40:27)
made 100 of these this is and that's why (40:24 - 40:28)
it's expensive because we didn't make a (40:27 - 40:30)
thousand of them so production was a lot (40:28 - 40:32)
higher I could like understand of like (40:30 - 40:34)
okay a limited run they only made a (40:32 - 40:35)
hundred obviously the more you make the (40:34 - 40:37)
cheaper it becomes (40:35 - 40:40)
nothing here sold them no nothing is (40:37 - 40:43)
sold out (40:40 - 40:46)
and like all the items the thing that (40:43 - 40:50)
feels like the a good purchase are the (40:46 - 40:51)
socks (40:50 - 40:55)
the 20 20 for a single pair of socks (40:51 - 40:56)
yeah but they're twenty dollars for a (40:55 - 40:58)
sock (40:56 - 41:01)
like (40:58 - 41:03)
high quality sock yeah maybe I don't (41:01 - 41:05)
know (41:03 - 41:05)
um (41:07 - 41:11)
yeah look I know inflation has hit but (41:08 - 41:14)
that TCG live hoodie came out literally (41:11 - 41:16)
five days before these Team Rockets (41:14 - 41:19)
I understand inflation is real but (41:16 - 41:21)
the inflation did not happen in five (41:19 - 41:23)
days yeah it's not that real it is not (41:21 - 41:26)
that much and this is just really Team (41:23 - 41:28)

it wasn't a very long appointment (42:32 - 42:38)

Japan (43:23 - 43:28)
scarlet and violet 151 expansion there (43:25 - 43:34)
is a 160 cards 12 new exes all 151 (43:28 - 43:38)
Pokemon in Pokedex order 10 trainer (43:34 - 43:41)
cards and then illustrations featuring a (43:38 - 43:43)
single artist capturing the entire (43:41 - 43:45)
evolution chain I like how that was a (43:43 - 43:47)
bullet point (43:45 - 43:50)
this comes out on September 22nd which (43:47 - 43:54)
is a little over a month after (43:50 - 43:58)
uh what is that called obsidian flame (43:54 - 44:00)
comes out hmm (43:58 - 44:03)
which is 180 cards (44:00 - 44:04)
so (44:03 - 44:08)
the TCG is getting a 300 card increase (44:04 - 44:13)
in like a 45 day period (44:08 - 44:15)
I don't think a lot of these cards are (44:13 - 44:17)
particularly good though (44:15 - 44:18)
um (44:17 - 44:20)
I mean that's usually the general (44:18 - 44:23)
consensus of most pokemon cards is like (44:20 - 44:26)
90 of them are just filler (44:23 - 44:29)
but (44:26 - 44:32)
uh you know people say they're sick of (44:29 - 44:36)
Kanto and yet this happens time and time (44:32 - 44:38)
again (44:36 - 44:40)
to just (44:38 - 44:42)
always sells (44:40 - 44:44)
I mean same with the Team Rocket (44:42 - 44:46)
Clothing line it's just always going to (44:44 - 44:48)

two-sided poster uh (47:10 - 47:15)
uh which (47:13 - 47:18)
I I don't know if it's folded or rolled (47:15 - 47:21)
up it's very hard to tell here folded (47:18 - 47:24)
uh if it's folded then why even bother (47:21 - 47:26)
just throw it out they've already (47:24 - 47:28)
creased it (47:26 - 47:28)
that's a folded poster (47:32 - 47:36)
ah (47:37 - 47:41)
yeah (47:39 - 47:44)
uh they have the binder collection which (47:41 - 47:47)
they're saying is 24.99 (47:44 - 47:51)
it includes four booster packs and then (47:47 - 47:55)
a nine pocket album that holds up to 360 (47:51 - 47:58)
cards it doesn't (47:55 - 48:01)
look like this is in collaboration with (47:58 - 48:03)
Ultra Pro but they have done Ultra Pro (48:01 - 48:06)
collaborations in the past (48:03 - 48:06)
um hard hard to say that I don't see any (48:07 - 48:13)
Ultra Pro branding though (48:09 - 48:15)
um there's the booster bundle (48:13 - 48:17)
I think some of these prices are not 100 (48:15 - 48:21)
right but uh uh this is just what Pokey (48:17 - 48:22)
Beach is reporting there's the booster (48:21 - 48:24)

Charizard premium collection the one (48:53 - 48:59)
before that which was for (48:55 - 48:59)
celebrations (49:00 - 49:06)

Ultra premium collection (50:18 - 50:25)
it is while it it has sold out the more (50:20 - 50:28)
stores will get it I promise you it will (50:25 - 50:31)
be fine I am also confident they will (50:28 - 50:34)
over print the heck out of this set (50:31 - 50:37)
do not do do not we do not fall for the (50:34 - 50:39)
Charizard like celebrations was also (50:37 - 50:42)
during the pandemic and printing was (50:39 - 50:45)
tough we know this we do not have (50:42 - 50:48)
printing issues anymore I want to stress (50:45 - 50:52)
we do not have printing issues any more (50:48 - 50:54)
we have shipping issues but not printing (50:52 - 50:55)
issues (50:54 - 50:59)
do not over pay for this set do you guys (50:55 - 51:02)
remember when celebrations came out I (50:59 - 51:05)
walked into my local game store board (51:02 - 51:06)
game Barrister I'm gonna name them I (51:05 - 51:09)
live in Milwaukee anymore (51:06 - 51:11)
I walked in (51:09 - 51:16)
and they had a uh they had a (51:11 - 51:17)
celebrations (51:16 - 51:24)
uh Ultra premium collection for 400 on (51:17 - 51:25)
their Shelf (51:24 - 51:29)
MSRP 120. (51:25 - 51:31)
just sitting up on their show and it's (51:29 - 51:34)
that for it's it's effort at least when (51:31 - 51:36)
I moved it still didn't sell it was (51:34 - 51:38)
another (51:36 - 51:38)
that's a choice (51:39 - 51:45)
just they uh also the same the same (51:42 - 51:48)
place that was when there was like those (51:45 - 51:50)
oversized booster packs I don't know if (51:48 - 51:51)
you guys remember those oh yeah I (51:50 - 51:53)
remember those where they they did one (51:51 - 51:57)
for every region Kanto sino-jotto and (51:53 - 51:59)
they were selling them for trip they (51:57 - 52:02)
were 9.99 that was MSRP you go I mean (51:59 - 52:04)
Best Buy Target 9.99 if they had them (52:02 - 52:08)
they were selling them for 30 bucks just (52:04 - 52:10)
yeah like all of those at Target (52:08 - 52:13)
oh yeah I got one of the Hoenn ones at (52:10 - 52:15)
Target I opened it on Halloween that (52:13 - 52:17)
year (52:15 - 52:18)
um (52:17 - 52:21)
do not overpay for these as as far as I (52:18 - 52:23)
I look if if you don't end up getting an (52:21 - 52:26)
ultra premium collection because you (52:23 - 52:28)
took that advice I I apologize in (52:26 - 52:31)
advance but as as far as We Know (52:28 - 52:35)
there has not been (52:31 - 52:35)
a lack of printing like if the if (52:35 - 52:39)
Pokemon company could have printed more (52:37 - 52:42)
celebrations to put them on shelves they (52:39 - 52:44)
would have (52:42 - 52:48)
they definitely would have (52:44 - 52:50)
but nothing nothing in the scarlet and (52:48 - 52:53)
violet set were the the couple sets (52:50 - 52:57)
before that in in sword and shield were (52:53 - 52:59)
really hard to find they they came out (52:57 - 53:01)
they were like we're printing more where (52:59 - 53:03)
they reprinted Vivid voltage they (53:01 - 53:05)
reprinted (53:03 - 53:08)
um whatever battle Styles (53:05 - 53:10)
like they reprinted everything once like (53:08 - 53:13)
they were able to reprint (53:10 - 53:14)
um (53:13 - 53:17)
so I I I understand things are sold out (53:14 - 53:19)
right now but like it's not the full (53:17 - 53:21)
collection not every store has gotten (53:19 - 53:23)
fulfillment like these Ultra Premium (53:21 - 53:25)
collections haven't even gone up on (53:23 - 53:27)
Pokemon Center yet right um there (53:25 - 53:29)
there's there should be plenty for (53:27 - 53:30)
everyone (53:29 - 53:33)
uh just remember the Charizard Ultra (53:30 - 53:35)
premium collection they were they were (53:33 - 53:36)
marked down to like seventy dollars (53:35 - 53:38)
because Target and Best Buy were (53:36 - 53:40)
desperate to get rid of them because (53:38 - 53:43)
they printed so many of them (53:40 - 53:45)
yeah and again scalpers were trying to (53:43 - 53:47)
sell the Charizard premium collection (53:45 - 53:50)
for two three hundred dollars and if you (53:47 - 53:52)
just waited yeah you could have walked (53:50 - 53:54)
into a Target and got him for 70 bucks (53:52 - 53:57)
scalpers and shambles that they were (53:54 - 53:59)
sitting on all of these (53:57 - 54:03)
uh there's a Alakazam ex box come in (53:59 - 54:05)
there is a Zapdos EX box coming there (54:03 - 54:08)
are mini tins coming so this is the (54:05 - 54:09)
first time this is the first time (54:08 - 54:11)
Kadabra will be on a card (54:09 - 54:17)
since since the lawsuit uh-huh (54:11 - 54:17)
oh I think they slapped Kadabra on (54:18 - 54:23)
something else too (54:20 - 54:25)
um besides this box I think they put him (54:23 - 54:27)
somewhere else as well (54:25 - 54:28)
um (54:27 - 54:29)
there are they're supposed to be (54:28 - 54:32)
giveaways GameStop is supposed to have a (54:29 - 54:33)
Charmander (54:32 - 54:35)
bonus Best Buy is supposed to have a (54:33 - 54:37)
Bulbasaur bonus (54:35 - 54:40)
ah Squirtle nowhere to be seen (54:37 - 54:43)
squirtle's the rare one (54:40 - 54:43)
yeah that's a mess because no one at (54:46 - 54:50)
Target knows what they're doing they (54:48 - 54:52)
don't (54:50 - 54:52)
but if you're lucky you'll get a Target (54:52 - 54:55)
that just slapped him on the counter (54:54 - 54:56)
because they didn't know what to do with (54:55 - 54:58)
them and you can just walk in and snag (54:56 - 55:00)
it (54:58 - 55:00)
uh this that seems exciting it it's (55:00 - 55:05)
probably a set where you know people who (55:03 - 55:07)
don't normally buy Pokemon cards they (55:05 - 55:08)
would probably buy some of this stuff (55:07 - 55:10)
and probably have a pretty good time (55:08 - 55:11)
opening some of the Full Art ones are (55:10 - 55:16)
really good art like I like the art (55:11 - 55:16)
the Mew is Mewtwo and the Snorlax that (55:17 - 55:20)
they're showing on the side I think all (55:19 - 55:24)
are really nice art pieces (55:20 - 55:24)
with all the rest of the cards the full (55:26 - 55:31)
arts just keep getting better and better (55:27 - 55:31)
okay let's uh switch gears here a little (55:35 - 55:38)
bit (55:37 - 55:41)
um this is actually (55:38 - 55:41)
this I I guess this is rolling out (55:41 - 55:47)
worldwide slowly to each country (55:44 - 55:48)
um but (55:47 - 55:51)
this happened a little over a month ago (55:48 - 55:53)
maybe even two months ago uh Niantic (55:51 - 55:57)
launched a web store for Pokemon go (55:53 - 55:59)
um (55:57 - 55:59)
I'll this is this is off Pokemon go (55:59 - 56:04)
live.com new way to get bonus pokecoins (56:02 - 56:05)
we're excited to announce the new (56:04 - 56:07)
Pokemon go web store is coming to (56:05 - 56:09)
additional regions and even uh more (56:07 - 56:11)

purchased through the web store will (56:27 - 56:31)
also have additional value providing (56:29 - 56:33)
extra pokecoins in each bundle it is the (56:31 - 56:34)
perfect time to stock up for Pokey coins (56:33 - 56:36)
before a big event you can check out the (56:34 - 56:37)
web store here (56:36 - 56:39)
trainers can access the web store on any (56:37 - 56:41)
device that supports a web browser with (56:39 - 56:44)
additional payment methods uh globally (56:41 - 56:46)
uh (56:44 - 56:47)
um (56:46 - 56:50)
and to celebrate the solstice event (56:47 - 56:52)
which is happening right now (56:50 - 56:53)
um (56:52 - 56:56)
they have uh (56:53 - 56:59)
a bundle here which if I compare (56:56 - 57:02)
the in-game price (56:59 - 57:05)
to the web store price it's like a (57:02 - 57:08)
four dollar difference (57:05 - 57:10)
I would say five but 1500 Pokey coins (57:08 - 57:12)
isn't exactly (57:10 - 57:15)
five dollars I mean I guess technically (57:12 - 57:17)
if you were to (57:15 - 57:17)
not buy the (57:17 - 57:24)
one thing so Solstice boss box is 1500 (57:21 - 57:28)
Pokey coins 1 500 Pokey coins and if you (57:24 - 57:29)
go to the web store you can get the same (57:28 - 57:33)
thing for ten dollars for three remote (57:29 - 57:35)
raid passes nine super incubators and (57:33 - 57:38)
nine golden raspberries yeah golden (57:35 - 57:39)
raspberries we don't even have to talk (57:38 - 57:42)
about they're not worth anything (57:39 - 57:44)
um nine super incubators I guess if you (57:42 - 57:45)
were to buy them separately would be (57:44 - 57:47)
eighteen dollars (57:45 - 57:49)
uh remote raid passes separately would (57:47 - 57:51)
be I'm just gonna round up to two (57:49 - 57:52)
dollars that's what they are they're two (57:51 - 57:54)
bucks don't let the 190 fool you there (57:52 - 57:57)
too much (57:54 - 58:00)
um so yeah you're looking at like uh you (57:57 - 58:02)
know 24 (58:00 - 58:05)
worth of stuff I mean ultimately it's (58:02 - 58:07)
worth zero dollars doesn't cost not (58:05 - 58:08)
gonna take any money to make a rate pass (58:07 - 58:11)
but if you were to buy them all (58:08 - 58:13)
separately would be twenty four dollars (58:11 - 58:16)
um the solstice box is 9.99 (58:13 - 58:18)
on the web store and then in the game (58:16 - 58:20)
it's 1500 Pokey coins which you can't (58:18 - 58:22)
buy 1500 pokecoins separately so you (58:20 - 58:24)
would either have to (58:22 - 58:26)
do (58:24 - 58:29)
the 550 three times (58:26 - 58:32)
or the 550 plus the 1200 which gives you (58:29 - 58:37)
about 17. ultimately it's 15 dollars (58:32 - 58:37)
now when they initially announced the (58:37 - 58:43)
web store it was around the time of the (58:40 - 58:46)
remote raid pass increase (58:43 - 58:48)
and I saw a bunch of this is what I saw (58:46 - 58:51)
on social media which (58:48 - 58:53)
one day we can hope that social media (58:51 - 58:56)
gets burned down but we're getting there (58:53 - 58:59)
important (58:56 - 58:59)
but I saw people being like oh look at (59:02 - 59:07)
Niantic just trying to get money (59:05 - 59:10)
uh and then I saw another thing but this (59:07 - 59:13)
is a good thing and let me explain why (59:10 - 59:15)
this is Niantic bypassing the Apple and (59:13 - 59:18)
Google yes right yes yeah like this is (59:15 - 59:19)
them saying (59:18 - 59:23)
buy it this way so that we can discount (59:19 - 59:24)
it (59:23 - 59:26)
basically saying we're getting the same (59:24 - 59:28)
amount of money because we don't have to (59:26 - 59:31)
put in an Apple or Google tax (59:28 - 59:33)
right right but even even in the sense (59:31 - 59:35)
okay so I have two points but even in (59:33 - 59:37)
the sense before I get distracted you as (59:35 - 59:39)
a customer are saving five dollars yes (59:37 - 59:42)
so that's great that's like that is (59:39 - 59:43)
fantastic if you were going to buy the (59:42 - 59:45)
solstice box and you know the majority (59:43 - 59:47)
of people won't we know that we know (59:45 - 59:49)
that the the people who are spending (59:47 - 59:52)
money in this game are whales (59:49 - 59:54)
and you know (59:52 - 59:56)
there there are probably there are (59:54 - 59:59)
people like me that probably spend ten (59:56 - 60:02)
to twenty dollars a month on this game (59:59 - 60:05)
um (60:02 - 60:05)
what is this this should know just come (60:05 - 60:12)
no shock to you Greg it it shocks me (60:08 - 60:16)
every time because my brain literally (60:12 - 60:18)
says (60:16 - 60:21)
why because I like the game on what what (60:18 - 60:24)
are you even doing (60:21 - 60:26)
I actually don't need the sauces box I (60:24 - 60:27)
don't care that much about incubators (60:26 - 60:30)
don't I'm gonna set up a patreon that (60:27 - 60:33)
says give me money instead of go just (60:30 - 60:35)
give it to me I will use it for better (60:33 - 60:38)
things more responsibly okay but this (60:35 - 60:41)
this is this is good for players because (60:38 - 60:43)
they are legitimately saving money yes (60:41 - 60:47)
but the thing that people like (60:43 - 60:50)
I I guess no one understood the actual (60:47 - 60:54)
epic lawsuit against Apple (60:50 - 60:57)
at all which which I guess I I guess I'm (60:54 - 60:59)
not surprised but let me explain the (60:57 - 61:02)
very basics of it so (60:59 - 61:06)
fortnite got pulled from the App Store (61:02 - 61:08)
this was like two years ago I think (61:06 - 61:10)
maybe a year ago two years ago fortnite (61:08 - 61:12)
got pulled from the App Store fortnite (61:10 - 61:16)
very popular on iOS (61:12 - 61:18)
um very you know you buy your I don't (61:16 - 61:19)
know what the coins are called in (61:18 - 61:22)
fortnite you buy your fortnite coins (61:19 - 61:25)
What epic did with fortnite is when you (61:22 - 61:29)
went to go check out in for the in-app (61:25 - 61:32)
purchase in fortnite they made a little (61:29 - 61:34)
pop-up pop-up and said you can save (61:32 - 61:38)
money if you go to our web store and buy (61:34 - 61:41)
it there right before they went to (61:38 - 61:44)
purchase in iOS they made a pop-up (61:41 - 61:48)
happen and that was against the terms of (61:44 - 61:52)
service what Niantic is doing here of (61:48 - 61:54)
having a web store is not against the (61:52 - 61:57)
terms of service at all and I just saw (61:54 - 61:59)
hundreds of people being like they're (61:57 - 62:01)
gonna it's this is the Fortnight (61:59 - 62:05)
situation no it's not the fortnite tons (62:01 - 62:09)
tons of apps do this my calendar app I (62:05 - 62:11)
pay 40 a year for a calendar my twitch (62:09 - 62:13)
chat always makes fun of me I live by (62:11 - 62:15)
this calendar this calendar is the best (62:13 - 62:17)
calendar in the world forty dollars a (62:15 - 62:18)
year is like (62:17 - 62:21)
three dollars and eighty cents a month (62:18 - 62:23)
or something like that (62:21 - 62:26)
I don't buy it through iOS I I go to (62:23 - 62:28)
their website I purchase it it syncs (62:26 - 62:30)
with my account and then the purchase is (62:28 - 62:32)
there the same as like one password the (62:30 - 62:36)
same as todoist the same as uh like I I (62:32 - 62:37)
just named three apps right there three (62:36 - 62:39)
non-gaming apps I can go to their web (62:37 - 62:41)
store I can purchase I think Evernote (62:39 - 62:44)
does this I think I like Omni task does (62:41 - 62:47)
this uh Adobe does this if you want (62:44 - 62:49)
Photoshop you can go to adobe.com buy (62:47 - 62:51)
Photoshop get the Photoshop on the iPad (62:49 - 62:53)
it syncs (62:51 - 62:56)
Niantic is not doing anything weird here (62:53 - 62:58)
I know you all hate Niantic but stop (62:56 - 63:00)
making up fake scenarios in your head (62:58 - 63:02)
this is completely fine and legal what (63:00 - 63:05)
fortnite did was try to redirect the (63:02 - 63:08)
customers in the app now with that being (63:05 - 63:09)
said (63:08 - 63:11)
what Apple and Google are doing because (63:09 - 63:13)
Google don't Google's not off the hook (63:11 - 63:15)
here Google is doing the same thing (63:13 - 63:18)
apple is doing uh (63:15 - 63:19)
sucks (63:18 - 63:22)
because it's forcing the customers to (63:19 - 63:25)
use their portal and Google and Apple (63:22 - 63:27)
whether you hate one or the other or you (63:25 - 63:30)
hate both that's fine you can hate both (63:27 - 63:34)
um they take 30 of your purchase (63:30 - 63:35)
uh (63:34 - 63:38)
so when you spend a dollar in Pokemon go (63:35 - 63:42)
and you give Niantic 99 Cents Google or (63:38 - 63:46)
Apple are taking 30 of those cents and (63:42 - 63:48)
then Niantic gets stuck with 70 cents (63:46 - 63:51)
and at that point we have no clue how (63:48 - 63:53)
much Niantic keeps how much the Pokemon (63:51 - 63:56)
company keeps like we we don't know the (63:53 - 63:59)
split but (63:56 - 64:02)
apples will sit on this and for the (63:59 - 64:04)
record I used to work at Apple I'm still (64:02 - 64:06)
for better or worse than Apple fan boy (64:04 - 64:09)
but the (64:06 - 64:12)
the kind of gouging they have of like (64:09 - 64:15)
taking 30 of everything (64:12 - 64:18)
and then kind of making secret deals (64:15 - 64:20)
with other companies but not offering (64:18 - 64:22)
those deals to other like like at one (64:20 - 64:23)
point like (64:22 - 64:25)
Netflix apparently has some secret deal (64:23 - 64:27)
with Apple (64:25 - 64:30)
like we know that Pokemon go makes a lot (64:27 - 64:30)
of money (64:30 - 64:34)
[Music] (64:30 - 64:37)
it is constantly like top 10 in the (64:34 - 64:40)
iTunes and the IOS app store of like top (64:37 - 64:43)
grossing games and (64:40 - 64:46)
uh you know Apple does a little little (64:43 - 64:48)
to nothing uh besides maybe sometimes (64:46 - 64:52)
like feature Pokemon go in like video (64:48 - 64:55)
actually yeah pretty often but (64:52 - 64:58)
now to anyone being like (64:55 - 65:01)
well like like it is it is borderline (64:58 - 65:05)
Monopoly practice to be like well you (65:01 - 65:08)
need to you need to be in the IOS app (65:05 - 65:12)
store right like like you and you ha and (65:08 - 65:15)
purchases have to go through iOS and (65:12 - 65:17)
when they go through iOS Apple or Google (65:15 - 65:20)
take 30 now on Google you can sideload (65:17 - 65:22)
stuff that's true (65:20 - 65:25)
um uh Apple doesn't allow that (65:22 - 65:27)
but (65:25 - 65:29)
it's not like you it's not like you can (65:27 - 65:32)
download another app store you have to (65:29 - 65:34)
use Apple's App Store you have to be (65:32 - 65:35)
there (65:34 - 65:38)
like you you can argue like well if they (65:35 - 65:39)
don't like it they they they don't have (65:38 - 65:42)
to use it where else is that Pokemon go (65:39 - 65:44)
supposed to go you can't go to like (65:42 - 65:47)
Pokemon go.com and directly download the (65:44 - 65:50)
app you have to get it through iOS (65:47 - 65:54)
it's the only way to get the if the only (65:50 - 65:57)
store is IOS and the only way to shop is (65:54 - 65:59)
IOS and the only way to browse new stuff (65:57 - 66:00)
is iOS (65:59 - 66:02)
I don't know that's pretty close to (66:00 - 66:05)
Monopoly (66:02 - 66:07)
but the only option is to give Apple 30 (66:05 - 66:08)
percent (66:07 - 66:10)
and Google I just want to say that (66:08 - 66:12)
Google Google does it too (66:10 - 66:14)
um (66:12 - 66:18)
so this web store (66:14 - 66:19)
is (66:18 - 66:21)
good (66:19 - 66:23)
they're by passing the middleman I think (66:21 - 66:25)
the majority of people won't use it (66:23 - 66:27)
because there's a huge convenience to (66:25 - 66:29)
iOS oh yeah and there's a he like the (66:27 - 66:31)
reason that the reason that these app (66:29 - 66:32)
stores Google and apple are both (66:31 - 66:35)
successful is because it's so easy to be (66:32 - 66:38)
like let me spend 99 Cents oh let me (66:35 - 66:39)
spend ten dollars (66:38 - 66:42)
let's also be clear this is not the only (66:39 - 66:44)
business that does this in my office (66:42 - 66:46)
building when I worked at an office (66:44 - 66:48)
building Target (66:46 - 66:50)
which was two blocks away (66:48 - 66:54)
was at least 30 percent cheaper than the (66:50 - 66:56)
in-building convenience store (66:54 - 67:01)
I was paying 30 more for convenience to (66:56 - 67:03)
run down and grab a soda for four (67:01 - 67:06)
dollars instead of walking two blocks (67:03 - 67:09)
down and dealing with them for a three (67:06 - 67:12)
dollars so like this isn't the only this (67:09 - 67:14)
is a long-standing model that they are (67:12 - 67:19)
going to charge you for convenience like (67:14 - 67:21)
it's a thing right (67:19 - 67:23)
um and there are ways around like even (67:21 - 67:25)
in the Apple Store there are ways around (67:23 - 67:27)
your app going through like you can (67:25 - 67:29)
offer for free but full functionality (67:27 - 67:31)
can't be paid for until you go to their (67:29 - 67:34)
website like there are ways around (67:31 - 67:38)
having to pay Apple to some extent (67:34 - 67:42)
um depending on what amount of (67:38 - 67:44)
pain you're willing to put your users (67:42 - 67:46)
through right like I have a million (67:44 - 67:49)
Health tracking apps (67:46 - 67:51)
I don't have to pay for them to download (67:49 - 67:53)
them from the Apple store but if I want (67:51 - 67:56)
full functionality I have to pay for (67:53 - 67:59)
them either on their website or through (67:56 - 68:01)
the app which again will hit the Apple (67:59 - 68:04)
text but like there's ways around it but (68:01 - 68:06)
most people won't take it because (68:04 - 68:08)
they're paying (68:06 - 68:10)
for convenience they are saying it is (68:08 - 68:14)
easier for me to do this on the Fly (68:10 - 68:16)
in app when I suddenly remember I need (68:14 - 68:19)
it than to go to a website and try to (68:16 - 68:22)
pre-plan for it like you're paying you (68:19 - 68:25)
they heavily rely on the convenience (68:22 - 68:27)
charge yeah Twitter Twitter does this (68:25 - 68:28)
too you can go to twitter.com and spend (68:27 - 68:31)
eight dollars for your your blue check (68:28 - 68:34)
mark and let everyone make fun of you (68:31 - 68:38)
um or you can get it through iOS or (68:34 - 68:39)
oh I actually don't think it's on Google (68:38 - 68:42)
yet or you get through iOS for it's 11 (68:39 - 68:44)
it's it's literally three dollars more (68:42 - 68:46)
because they know apple is taking the 30 (68:44 - 68:49)
percent you even Elon Musk (68:46 - 68:54)
argue the 30 discount with Mr Tim Apple (68:49 - 68:56)
Mr Ken (68:54 - 68:58)
there are two companies you're never (68:56 - 69:00)
getting a dime out of apple and Disney (68:58 - 69:04)
you might get a dime out of Google maybe (69:00 - 69:06)
so I I think the majority of players (69:04 - 69:09)
won't go won't go to this web store at (69:06 - 69:10)
all right (69:09 - 69:11)
but if you're listening to this podcast (69:10 - 69:14)
you will probably (69:11 - 69:16)
um (69:14 - 69:18)
you're probably a hardcore enough player (69:16 - 69:21)
two consider going to the web store to (69:18 - 69:23)
save five bucks like if you are going to (69:21 - 69:25)
buy Pokey coins or if you're going to (69:23 - 69:28)
buy something in in their store (69:25 - 69:30)
web store is gonna get you more (69:28 - 69:33)
yeah so if you're going to give them you (69:30 - 69:33)
know (69:33 - 69:35)
twenty dollars for Pokemon go Fest (69:33 - 69:37)
because you want coins beforehand (69:35 - 69:40)
go to the web store if you want the (69:37 - 69:41)
solstice bundle literally save yourself (69:40 - 69:44)
five dollars go to the web store (69:41 - 69:45)
um (69:44 - 69:47)
you just have to sign in with your (69:45 - 69:50)
Pokemon go account you purchase it on (69:47 - 69:53)
your computer or your phone and it will (69:50 - 69:56)
sync to your game so (69:53 - 69:58)
um does Niantic get more money (69:56 - 70:00)
yeah of course yeah because Apple and (69:58 - 70:01)
Google are not getting more money are (70:00 - 70:05)
you saving money yes yes you are yes so (70:01 - 70:07)
save money (70:05 - 70:07)
I I think it's a good thing and I think (70:08 - 70:12)
more if if more (70:10 - 70:15)
companies did this (70:12 - 70:17)
I don't think it would change like Apple (70:15 - 70:19)
or Google stance (70:17 - 70:23)
until like this became easier (70:19 - 70:25)
and they don't have a way to make it (70:23 - 70:27)
easier because Apple won't let them make (70:25 - 70:29)
it easier because Apple knows if it was (70:27 - 70:30)
easier they would lose money but if more (70:29 - 70:32)
and more places do this and this becomes (70:30 - 70:35)
more common then Apple would be more (70:32 - 70:36)
forced to change their hand there's like (70:35 - 70:38)
laws and legislation in place and (70:36 - 70:40)
they're trying to get apple to like (70:38 - 70:42)
change it up a bit (70:40 - 70:43)
that's going to take forever because (70:42 - 70:45)
like Apple's very good at dragging their (70:43 - 70:47)
feet in court (70:45 - 70:49)
um yeah it's it's a It's let's say this (70:47 - 70:52)
it is a very complicated situations and (70:49 - 70:55)
there's not a CEO in the world (70:52 - 70:58)
that is generally in favor for putting (70:55 - 71:01)
up restrictions to stop a company from (70:58 - 71:03)
making money so it's a hard sell for (71:01 - 71:07)
other CEOs to also be like let's make a (71:03 - 71:08)
law because they'll look at their own (71:07 - 71:10)
books and be like (71:08 - 71:13)
but I kind of also want to rip people (71:10 - 71:16)
off so I kind of can't be too strong (71:13 - 71:20)
about this so like CEOs are stuck in the (71:16 - 71:24)
bind of let's make laws that bind my (71:20 - 71:28)
competitor but don't bind me and that is (71:24 - 71:30)
a tiny (71:28 - 71:34)
tiny needle to put that thread through (71:30 - 71:34)
uh also uh they announced uh Community (71:39 - 71:45)
Day classic Squirtle which will take (71:41 - 71:48)
place Sunday June 9th (71:45 - 71:52)
uh Squirtle will return I get it (71:48 - 71:55)
July 9th it's like June 9th has come and (71:52 - 71:58)
gone oh yeah July 9th uh it'll it says (71:55 - 72:00)
the Squirtle is number seven of the (71:58 - 72:02)
Pokedex during the seventh anniversary (72:00 - 72:05)
of Pokemon go oh that's cute (72:02 - 72:06)
um there's no glasses (72:05 - 72:08)
there are you can actually can get (72:06 - 72:12)
glasses not in the wild yes this is how (72:08 - 72:13)
it was the first time through the field (72:12 - 72:15)
researching your glasses (72:13 - 72:18)
who knows how hard or easy this will be (72:15 - 72:21)
I've I remembered it was pretty easy the (72:18 - 72:23)
first time yeah I remember being hard (72:21 - 72:25)
yeah so I don't know if they're gonna (72:23 - 72:30)
like make it harder this time I just (72:25 - 72:33)
traded you one didn't I yeah because I (72:30 - 72:34)
wanted (72:33 - 72:37)
I wanted to um I like to get mega (72:34 - 72:40)
Pokemon as lucky because I'll do a mega (72:37 - 72:43)
Pokemon this the for the record I've (72:40 - 72:45)
people have called me out and having two (72:43 - 72:47)
bad trades to Greg one was for a shiny (72:45 - 72:50)
Slowpoke and then one was for a shiny (72:47 - 72:52)
Squirtle with glasses for the reasoning (72:50 - 72:57)
for that is because I wanted good IVs (72:52 - 73:00)
but also shiny but also lucky so I had (72:57 - 73:02)
good IVs that I could power up and then (73:00 - 73:04)
mega evolved so both of those Pokemon (73:02 - 73:06)
could be Mega (73:04 - 73:10)
and I got nothing good for them yeah (73:06 - 73:13)
yeah you take your shiny you got shiny (73:10 - 73:14)
virusian and then (73:13 - 73:17)
something else (73:14 - 73:17)
what did I get shiny something so rare (73:20 - 73:26)
we can't even remember (73:23 - 73:26)
that wasn't shiny articudo I had one of (73:27 - 73:32)
those I don't remember I just like doing (73:30 - 73:34)
it honestly because I know like this oh (73:32 - 73:37)
isente it was oh yeah yeah yeah because (73:34 - 73:39)
people were like that Entei is worth so (73:37 - 73:41)
much more than the Slowpoke and I was (73:39 - 73:43)
like please explain to me how the eight (73:41 - 73:45)
shiny Entei that have been in my box (73:43 - 73:50)
since like 2019 are worth anything the (73:45 - 73:53)
Box space of getting rid of Entei is (73:50 - 73:57)
worth more to me than these have (73:53 - 74:01)
he's so much dust on them please take (73:57 - 74:05)
them it just Thrills me to know that (74:01 - 74:06)
they're going on Instagram and it's (74:05 - 74:10)
gonna cause drama and I love I'm like I (74:06 - 74:12)

Community Day if you don't have the (74:39 - 74:43)
costumed Squirtle um this is the third (74:41 - 74:45)
time Squirtle what sunglasses will be (74:43 - 74:47)
available because there was that weird (74:45 - 74:49)
Ed Sheeran event a a couple years ago (74:47 - 74:52)
yeah (74:49 - 74:52)
but boy yeah when the first Squirtle (74:52 - 74:59)
Community Day event happened it was (74:57 - 75:01)
still it was still in the beginning of (74:59 - 75:04)
Pokemon go enough that that was one that (75:01 - 75:06)
I went hardcore on that was a summer (75:04 - 75:08)
Community Day I did it with a friend I (75:06 - 75:11)
got all the Squirtle I needed that day (75:08 - 75:11)
um (75:11 - 75:13)
this is this is going to be an easy one (75:11 - 75:15)
to just sort of maybe open my game but (75:13 - 75:18)
I'm not gonna go super intense this is (75:15 - 75:22)
also the last Community day before uh (75:18 - 75:24)
the Pokemon go plus plus is out I (75:22 - 75:27)
believe yeah also when are we gonna get (75:24 - 75:30)
the right glasses on I don't know if we (75:27 - 75:33)
can't it's it's been like seven years we (75:30 - 75:34)
can't keep talking about the glasses (75:33 - 75:38)
it's been seven years (75:34 - 75:38)
when are we gonna get a tree coat with a (75:40 - 75:47)
straw that is the other one we need (75:43 - 75:47)
you wasting all your energy on the (75:47 - 75:50)
glasses when we could be talking about (75:49 - 75:53)
the tricos we could be uh do we want to (75:50 - 75:54)
speak about the other ripoff that just (75:53 - 75:57)
happened uh this whole show has been (75:54 - 75:59)
ripping ripping our listeners off so yes (75:57 - 76:02)
let's continue uh Pokemon unite added (75:59 - 76:04)
the prize machine that is a complete (76:02 - 76:07)
rip-off oh I did not play the price (76:04 - 76:09)
machine I think I had somebody explain (76:07 - 76:11)
this to me but they didn't say what it (76:09 - 76:14)
was called yeah it's the Pokemon they (76:11 - 76:16)
said like there are like three things (76:14 - 76:18)
and you get like a currency but then you (76:16 - 76:19)
have to like (76:18 - 76:21)
you get a free currency here let me see (76:19 - 76:23)
if I can explain it to you boy you're (76:21 - 76:25)
already wrong so okay there's there's (76:23 - 76:27)
like there's a handful of things in like (76:25 - 76:30)
the the slot machine yeah and (76:27 - 76:34)
your timer gives you like if you wait 12 (76:30 - 76:35)
hours you get some sort of currency (76:34 - 76:38)
which you can apply to that machine but (76:35 - 76:40)
you never get enough to actually buy (76:38 - 76:43)
anything so you have to top it off with (76:40 - 76:46)
real money (76:43 - 76:46)
yeah oh boy I mean mostly mostly the (76:46 - 76:52)
things are there so it's a price machine (76:49 - 76:54)
there are (76:52 - 76:58)
six slots that have various things in (76:54 - 77:00)
them so some of them are licenses some (76:58 - 77:02)
of them are costumes that aren't (77:00 - 77:03)
available anymore some of them are (77:02 - 77:05)
backgrounds that aren't available (77:03 - 77:08)
anymore and you get (77:05 - 77:12)
two pokeballs to throw (77:08 - 77:15)
and the Pokeball will give you a random (77:12 - 77:18)
amount between it goes one two (77:15 - 77:19)
three (77:18 - 77:22)
five and ten I think of how much it (77:19 - 77:25)
applies towards that thing so like if (77:22 - 77:28)
you're just shooting for a boost emblem (77:25 - 77:31)
that's bronze it's it costs six six (77:28 - 77:34)
points so you have an okay chance of (77:31 - 77:36)
getting that the problem is is that you (77:34 - 77:38)
have a fifty percent chance of getting a (77:36 - 77:38)
one (77:38 - 77:41)
and then everything else is divided (77:38 - 77:42)
going down (77:41 - 77:45)
you get two Pokeballs (77:42 - 77:48)
every 12 hours (77:45 - 77:50)
the thing that they hide in the corner (77:48 - 77:54)
is all progress is lost when prizes (77:50 - 77:59)
change and prizes reset every day (77:54 - 78:02)
so the big ones like the big Eevee (77:59 - 78:04)
background that you can't get anymore (78:02 - 78:08)
is 40. it takes 40 hits (78:04 - 78:10)
to go (78:08 - 78:12)
you get two Pokeballs (78:10 - 78:16)
to recharge them is a hundred and twenty (78:12 - 78:18)
gems (78:16 - 78:19)
each (78:18 - 78:22)
which is two dollars per Pokeball (78:19 - 78:25)
so if you are extremely lucky you are (78:22 - 78:28)
paying (78:25 - 78:31)
35 dollars to get the Eevee background (78:28 - 78:34)
because that's how often you have to (78:31 - 78:36)
reset and your chances of getting one (78:34 - 78:41)
point is the most common thing so (78:36 - 78:43)
if you only get one the entire time you (78:41 - 78:44)
are paying (78:43 - 78:48)
a dollar per ball throw or forty dollars (78:44 - 78:50)
to pay for this but if you're really (78:48 - 78:53)
lucky if you're really lucky you might (78:50 - 78:56)
get a 10 once which will cut it down so (78:53 - 78:58)
but if what if you got four tens Greg (78:56 - 79:01)
yeah if you can get that one percent (78:58 - 79:03)
time four times you still but you only (79:01 - 79:06)
get two pokeballs before you have to buy (79:03 - 79:08)
ones yeah you would have to get one (79:06 - 79:10)
percent four times in a row but you're (79:08 - 79:12)
only paying four dollars then right (79:10 - 79:15)
if you're extremely lucky (79:12 - 79:19)
um and two dollars you it is you have no (79:15 - 79:21)
control over it it's hitting a button (79:19 - 79:23)
and it just randomly picks how much you (79:21 - 79:24)
get (79:23 - 79:28)
um it is the biggest ripoff and it is (79:24 - 79:31)
probably the most (79:28 - 79:35)
blatant just give us money thing which (79:31 - 79:37)
is like what what is making a lot and (79:35 - 79:39)
unite yeah (79:37 - 79:41)
I mean the game with forty dollars (79:39 - 79:44)
like it is one of the most blatant like (79:41 - 79:46)
just waste your money (79:44 - 79:48)
things a lot of people are really mad (79:46 - 79:51)
about it which is valid like (79:48 - 79:53)
there isn't even (79:51 - 79:56)
the only things you can be somewhat (79:53 - 79:58)
assured of maybe getting a new two (79:56 - 80:01)
pokeballs are the bronze (79:58 - 80:05)
emblems which you get hand over fist (80:01 - 80:07)
just by playing the game right like they (80:05 - 80:09)
are worth it (80:07 - 80:11)
um (80:09 - 80:14)
yeah it is it just it is leaving a bad (80:11 - 80:18)
taste and pretty much everybody's oh I (80:14 - 80:20)
found the Pokeball progress right so one (80:18 - 80:23)
point you get a there's a 66 chance of (80:20 - 80:25)
getting just one (80:23 - 80:27)
there's a 30 chance of getting two (80:25 - 80:31)
points there's a 3.3 chance of getting (80:27 - 80:35)
three points there's a point six percent (80:31 - 80:38)
chance of getting five points and there (80:35 - 80:42)
is a 0.1 chance of getting ten so one in (80:38 - 80:45)
a thousand yep (80:42 - 80:48)
and pokeballs replenish every 12 hours (80:45 - 80:51)
unless you pay gems (80:48 - 80:53)
I mean this this is just another thing (80:51 - 80:58)
for whales oh yeah yeah like most it (80:53 - 81:02)
would be I think it would be more (80:58 - 81:04)
well received if they just put these (81:02 - 81:07)
things in the in the shops and said just (81:04 - 81:09)
buy them just straight up here's the (81:07 - 81:10)
money I think it's the fact that it's (81:09 - 81:11)
like (81:10 - 81:14)
this weird gotcha gambling game that a (81:11 - 81:17)
lot of people are like nah no thank you (81:14 - 81:23)
this is this is really not a good thing (81:17 - 81:24)
um (81:23 - 81:26)
this has to come from another game right (81:24 - 81:30)
like it probably does I don't know where (81:26 - 81:32)
where they got the idea from (81:30 - 81:35)
um it sounds very like (81:32 - 81:37)
some other game is is doing this and (81:35 - 81:39)
they looked at that and was like it was (81:37 - 81:42)
like that it's wildly successful for (81:39 - 81:44)
this game let's bring it over here and (81:42 - 81:47)
we know that after 15 days the current (81:44 - 81:50)
set of prizes will completely reset and (81:47 - 81:51)
we don't know what's coming in the next (81:50 - 81:53)
set so the other thing is they're sort (81:51 - 81:55)
of banking on you (81:53 - 81:58)
thinking like well I want this and I (81:55 - 82:00)
only have 15 days because I don't know (81:58 - 82:02)
if it's the next pool set (82:00 - 82:05)
and I only have X amount of time so I'm (82:02 - 82:06)
just going to pay all this money to try (82:05 - 82:08)
to get this one thing that I missed (82:06 - 82:10)
because I missed it in the past it's (82:08 - 82:13)
it's just it's really (82:10 - 82:16)
it feels really garbagey (82:13 - 82:19)
it feels really weirdly greedy more than (82:16 - 82:22)
most like more than their 40 skins like (82:19 - 82:24)
that's at least somewhat honest on the (82:22 - 82:26)
front this one feels like they're trying (82:24 - 82:28)
to hide and get away with things because (82:26 - 82:30)
you it's really hard to find the (82:28 - 82:31)
percentages you have to go deep in the (82:30 - 82:33)
menus to find your chances of getting (82:31 - 82:35)
these things (82:33 - 82:37)
um not a great addition Leafeon however (82:35 - 82:39)
is a great addition and I would highly (82:37 - 82:41)
suggest you come in and play Leafeon (82:39 - 82:43)
because it's super fun let me tell you (82:41 - 82:46)
about Apex Legends nobody likes that (82:43 - 82:48)
game they have they have a standard loot (82:46 - 82:50)
box that have existed for four plus (82:48 - 82:53)
years it is a dollar you get three items (82:50 - 82:56)
in that loot box just a standard video (82:53 - 82:59)
game loot box that's all sometimes you (82:56 - 83:01)
get something good sometimes you don't (82:59 - 83:02)
most of the time you don't get anything (83:01 - 83:03)
good because there's so many items in (83:02 - 83:07)
Apex legends that you get the bad stuff (83:03 - 83:09)
when there's a special event or like an (83:07 - 83:12)
anniversary which is like every other (83:09 - 83:16)
month at this point they introduce a (83:12 - 83:18)
seven dollar loot box you still get (83:16 - 83:20)
three things (83:18 - 83:25)
it is seven dollars for one Spin and the (83:20 - 83:27)
items are usually the things that are (83:25 - 83:29)
featured in the collection but on top of (83:27 - 83:33)
introducing a seven dollar loot box (83:29 - 83:34)
they will have what is called an (83:33 - 83:37)
heirloom which is just a very fancy (83:34 - 83:39)
thing for a character to hold so when (83:37 - 83:40)
you're not like holding a gun and you're (83:39 - 83:43)
running you're holding your heirloom (83:40 - 83:45)
um I think OverWatch and other games (83:43 - 83:47)
have these these two just a you know (83:45 - 83:49)
just something your character holds it's (83:47 - 83:51)
cosmetic purely cosmetic (83:49 - 83:54)
if you pull everything from that (83:51 - 83:56)
collection (83:54 - 83:58)
from the seven dollar loot boxes you (83:56 - 84:01)
will get the heirloom for free but you (83:58 - 84:04)
have to pull everything in (84:01 - 84:09)
the the prize pool which means that you (84:04 - 84:12)
end up spending about a hundred and (84:09 - 84:15)
sixty dollars to get everything in the (84:12 - 84:18)
collection to then get the free I'm (84:15 - 84:21)
doing air quotes free heirloom (84:18 - 84:23)
and they do this like every like for two (84:21 - 84:26)
to three months (84:23 - 84:26)
it's a free to play game yeah the (84:27 - 84:33)
closest thing I can think of in Pokemon (84:31 - 84:35)
go is incubators but everyone admits (84:33 - 84:36)
that that's one of the worst parts of (84:35 - 84:39)
that game so yep (84:36 - 84:42)
yeah I think the frustrating thing with (84:39 - 84:45)
incubators is like you don't know the (84:42 - 84:49)
odds at least I mean I know the odds (84:45 - 84:51)
more now than you used to yeah that's (84:49 - 84:54)
because people like calculated it no (84:51 - 84:57)
they're the little egg symbols oh yeah (84:54 - 85:00)
yeah but those are that that's not 100 (84:57 - 85:03)
true (85:00 - 85:05)
it's more information now than we used (85:03 - 85:06)
to have (85:05 - 85:09)
um but it's I feel like even worse in (85:06 - 85:10)
some ways than the Apex thing because (85:09 - 85:11)
you can just keep getting the worst (85:10 - 85:13)
Pokemon out of those eggs over and over (85:11 - 85:14)
and over (85:13 - 85:17)
yeah the the seven dollar Apex loot box (85:14 - 85:19)
you can't get doubles well in the (85:17 - 85:20)
regular loot box you technically can't (85:19 - 85:22)
get doubles like if you pull like a (85:20 - 85:25)
basic common skin it's like forever (85:22 - 85:27)
unlocked but they keep adding more stuff (85:25 - 85:30)
so (85:27 - 85:33)
none of these are good they gotta they (85:30 - 85:35)
gotta pad out that loot these are all (85:33 - 85:37)
bad these are all bad (85:35 - 85:38)
you know what going back to the unite (85:37 - 85:43)
thing Greg the the weird thing to me (85:38 - 85:43)
it it is there's not a lot of stuff in (85:43 - 85:47)
Unite (85:46 - 85:50)
there's like what 50 playable characters (85:47 - 85:53)
at this point which is a lot too soon to (85:50 - 85:55)
be 53. that's that's a lot of characters (85:53 - 85:57)
but like (85:55 - 85:59)
when unite came out (85:57 - 86:01)
almost two years ago right it's we're (85:59 - 86:03)
approaching a two-year anniversary FYI (86:01 - 86:06)
master rank once again I represent this (86:03 - 86:09)
podcast beating people down with my (86:06 - 86:10)
grass (86:09 - 86:12)
I thought that we would be getting (86:10 - 86:16)
costumes on a weekly basis well yeah no (86:12 - 86:18)
and we're not we're not so it's like (86:16 - 86:20)
really weird to me that they would (86:18 - 86:21)
introduce a system to be like look at (86:20 - 86:23)
these emblems you missed or these (86:21 - 86:25)
costumes you missed like yeah I guess if (86:23 - 86:27)
you're like a Gengar player and you're (86:25 - 86:28)
like man I missed the space costume (86:27 - 86:30)
that'd be maybe exciting to see in the (86:28 - 86:33)
store but like what if they just (86:30 - 86:35)
introduced new costumes and then people (86:33 - 86:38)
could just buy them I would buy a 40 if (86:35 - 86:40)
they were like here's a new Cramer and (86:38 - 86:42)
skin 40 bucks that's my favorite Pokemon (86:40 - 86:45)
to I'll give you 40 like once a year for (86:42 - 86:49)
a new skin like that's worth it to me I (86:45 - 86:51)
[Music] (86:49 - 86:57)
don't think they see costumes as (86:51 - 86:57)
they don't sell costumes (86:57 - 87:02)
alone because that's how they want to (87:00 - 87:04)
sell the battle passes (87:02 - 87:06)
most costumes are now locked in the (87:04 - 87:09)
battle pass system so they want you to (87:06 - 87:12)
pay for a battle pass and play the game (87:09 - 87:15)
a lot to earn the costumes which is why (87:12 - 87:17)
I don't think we see any costumes coming (87:15 - 87:19)
out all that often except for when a new (87:17 - 87:22)
Pokemon is released (87:19 - 87:24)
um they make a special like all the EVS (87:22 - 87:25)
have these gingham outfits right now (87:24 - 87:27)
that are kind of cute and it's like the (87:25 - 87:29)
newest costumes we get that aren't part (87:27 - 87:31)
of a battle pass but they made the (87:29 - 87:33)
decision for better for worse that they (87:31 - 87:36)
are that they want to lock or at least (87:33 - 87:37)
it seems that they want to lock most (87:36 - 87:40)
costumes behind the season pass the (87:37 - 87:43)
battle pass (87:40 - 87:43)
the problem with that is like (87:43 - 87:48)
I don't care about the Pokemon yeah is (87:48 - 87:53)
that a good idea right like like what is (87:50 - 87:54)
the current one it's like zorark and (87:53 - 87:57)
Sylveon or something uh no we we just (87:54 - 88:00)
that one just left so now we have (87:57 - 88:04)
uh Scizor and (88:00 - 88:04)
oh man (88:05 - 88:09)
so scissor and something else yeah well (88:07 - 88:12)
scissor Scyther because it's for both (88:09 - 88:14)
um and then (88:12 - 88:16)
um I can't think of who the other one is (88:14 - 88:17)
right now (88:16 - 88:20)
but like I feel like I am more inclined (88:17 - 88:22)
to buy a battle pass when my characters (88:20 - 88:24)
I play are being featured like I play (88:22 - 88:26)
more I like I play more than credit ramp (88:24 - 88:27)
but like (88:26 - 88:28)
you know I bought the first three battle (88:27 - 88:30)
passes (88:28 - 88:34)
and I completed them yeah and they (88:30 - 88:37)
weren't like I I have the space Gengar (88:34 - 88:39)
guess what I've never equipped I don't (88:37 - 88:41)
even own Gengar like I never bought I I (88:39 - 88:44)
just I think I maybe rented maybe I do (88:41 - 88:46)
own Gengar I don't know I've probably (88:44 - 88:50)
only played them like once Mr mime (88:46 - 88:54)
that's the other it's Sizer and Mr mime (88:50 - 88:54)
to me a battle pass doesn't need like (88:56 - 89:00)
it's cool that like there's like one or (88:59 - 89:02)
two costs two costumes normally in the (89:00 - 89:03)
battle pass (89:02 - 89:05)
but like the the selling point of the (89:03 - 89:07)
battle pass isn't necessarily the (89:05 - 89:08)
costume although if my favorite Pokemon (89:07 - 89:10)
was in the Battle pass of course I would (89:08 - 89:13)
buy a no-brainer but like the the reward (89:10 - 89:16)
track is why I buy a battle pass yeah (89:13 - 89:18)
like am I going to play this enough to (89:16 - 89:20)
complete this because I know if I (89:18 - 89:22)
completed all the rewards leading up was (89:20 - 89:24)
worth my time but I still think the (89:22 - 89:26)
battle passes are pretty lackluster and (89:24 - 89:27)
like (89:26 - 89:30)
cool I got a pair of shorts I'm never (89:27 - 89:33)
going to wear yeah (89:30 - 89:36)
and like the best the season passes have (89:33 - 89:40)
both human costumes and (89:36 - 89:43)
um Pokemon costumes and I I think the (89:40 - 89:46)
new load screen has really changed how (89:43 - 89:49)
people might want their (89:46 - 89:51)
human costume to look like because (89:49 - 89:52)
before you could never see the other (89:51 - 89:54)
players right like you could see (89:52 - 89:56)
yourself and then when you were (89:54 - 89:58)
selecting your Pokemon on the loading (89:56 - 90:00)
screen that varies depending because (89:58 - 90:03)
their minions are wild you could click (90:00 - 90:04)
on the person's card and see their card (90:03 - 90:08)
the new loading screen s people (90:04 - 90:11)
hit yes their Avatar loads in so you see (90:08 - 90:15)
everybody's outfits that's finally so it (90:11 - 90:16)
there's now like they sort of figure (90:15 - 90:18)
like oh nobody's buying these outfits (90:16 - 90:20)
because nobody (90:18 - 90:22)
can see your outfit unless you (90:20 - 90:24)
constantly change your cards no there's (90:22 - 90:26)
like this new like oh now I can show off (90:24 - 90:28)
my outfit which I think is maybe gonna (90:26 - 90:30)
reinvigorate that which makes the season (90:28 - 90:32)
passes a little bit more worthwhile (90:30 - 90:35)
because if even if you don't like (90:32 - 90:38)
the Pokemon's outfits there is something (90:35 - 90:40)
for you in there so if you like it you (90:38 - 90:42)
are more willing to buy that season pass (90:40 - 90:44)
to get access to your own personal (90:42 - 90:48)
outfit but again I don't know why they (90:44 - 90:51)
made the the decision to lock them in (90:48 - 90:53)
the season pass and really step away (90:51 - 90:56)
from having them in the store they go (90:53 - 90:59)
into the store much much much later (90:56 - 91:03)
it is a weird decision I I I'm hoping it (90:59 - 91:05)
changes I don't know it's there's no way (91:03 - 91:06)
that like (91:05 - 91:09)
they're not selling costumes (91:06 - 91:12)
like you like fortnite is like the (91:09 - 91:14)
biggest free-to-play game in the world (91:12 - 91:16)
and all they do is sell costumes that's (91:14 - 91:20)
it I will say in in fortnite you can see (91:16 - 91:22)
your avatar whereas (91:20 - 91:24)
in you know I'm talking about the (91:22 - 91:29)
Pokemon costume yeah but but I even then (91:24 - 91:32)
that's a that's a little iffy it doesn't (91:29 - 91:34)
seem to be a big seller in unite but I (91:32 - 91:37)
think them changing how the load screens (91:34 - 91:41)
go is helping with that it's I don't (91:37 - 91:43)
know what they're doing it's it's just (91:41 - 91:46)
like it's weird like I I understand (91:43 - 91:50)
there's probably the the wall of getting (91:46 - 91:51)
things approved because they probably (91:50 - 91:53)
have to go through the Pokemon about (91:51 - 91:55)
that wondering if it slows things down (91:53 - 91:57)
but (91:55 - 92:00)
man when I like log into that game and I (91:57 - 92:01)
like go to the store I'm like I want (92:00 - 92:03)
like even for Pokemon I don't care about (92:01 - 92:05)
I want to see the cool costumes and it's (92:03 - 92:07)
like oh no one got any costumes like the (92:05 - 92:09)
only costume is this nooses or costume (92:07 - 92:12)
like yep that's cool everybody look like (92:09 - 92:14)
they work in a fast food restaurant I'm (92:12 - 92:16)
just so shocked that that game isn't (92:14 - 92:18)
just pumping out costume after costume (92:16 - 92:20)
after costume (92:18 - 92:22)
although because the ones that are there (92:20 - 92:24)
are pretty good yeah I mean the ones (92:22 - 92:25)
they have are good (92:24 - 92:28)
uh zashian finally got nerfed and all is (92:25 - 92:29)
right in the world again George (92:28 - 92:31)
Washington Charizard is a very good skin (92:29 - 92:34)
it is (92:31 - 92:37)
uh yeah I don't I don't know what (92:34 - 92:38)
they're doing I don't know what they're (92:37 - 92:39)
doing with their money (92:38 - 92:42)
back there like the gameplay is in a (92:39 - 92:43)
good spot (92:42 - 92:45)
right now (92:43 - 92:46)
a lot of people got nerfed that should (92:45 - 92:48)
have got Nerf they finally took the (92:46 - 92:50)
teeth out of Lapras and everybody's (92:48 - 92:52)
