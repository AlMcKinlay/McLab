so that you it's a honey pot so people (2:43 - 2:48)

i'm about to set it up you know if you (3:21 - 3:25)
if your boys didn't interrupt me nonstop (3:23 - 3:28)
oh here we go if you'd ever get to the (3:25 - 3:30)
point the right the first time we (3:28 - 3:31)
wouldn't have to interrupt and correct (3:30 - 3:32)
you (3:31 - 3:34)
if i always got directly to the point we (3:32 - 3:36)
would have a 15-minute show and (3:34 - 3:39)
everybody would be happy (3:36 - 3:41)
they'd be so thrilled they could move on (3:39 - 3:44)
to their next podcast (3:41 - 3:44)
the one with actual news about the world (3:45 - 3:50)
i have way too many windows open (3:48 - 3:53)
uh hey speaking about news in the world (3:50 - 3:55)
uh this was (3:53 - 3:56)
given to (3:55 - 3:58)
um what do they call those people who (3:56 - 4:02)
report news reports journalists (3:58 - 4:06)
pr pr stuff uh the pokemon company (4:02 - 4:09)
yeah yes uh press release is not uh (4:06 - 4:12)
that's not news no (4:09 - 4:13)
okay (4:12 - 4:15)
well i'm reporting on it so it's my news (4:13 - 4:17)
right yeah i'm like yeah (4:15 - 4:19)
you're the quote-unquote journalist in (4:17 - 4:21)
this correct yes please verify me on (4:19 - 4:24)
twitter uh this says this so the pokemon (4:21 - 4:26)
company said we wish to be sensitive to (4:24 - 4:28)
major world events happening at this (4:26 - 4:31)
time and those impacted a pre-scheduled (4:28 - 4:32)
pokemon presents was unable to be (4:31 - 4:35)
postponed out of respect to our global (4:32 - 4:37)
audiences we decided to we decided to (4:35 - 4:40)
significantly reduce the promotion of (4:37 - 4:42)
the event while also giving fans an (4:40 - 4:44)
opportunity to tune in if they choose to (4:42 - 4:46)
do so in closed you will find the press (4:44 - 4:48)
materials supporting the announcements (4:46 - 4:50)
made in the presentation (4:48 - 4:51)
so (4:50 - 4:52)
i would i would say that today's news (4:51 - 4:56)
was pretty big obviously uh (4:52 - 4:58)
and you would maybe (4:56 - 5:00)
i i saw lots of people this morning that (4:58 - 5:02)
didn't not know that this was happening (5:00 - 5:05)
um so it was not promoted as heavily as (5:02 - 5:07)
it it was especially for the 25th (5:05 - 5:09)
including will i bet will didn't listen (5:07 - 5:12)
to before yeah i heard (5:09 - 5:15)
i heard all messed up (5:12 - 5:15)
so we will be going over that we'll be (5:16 - 5:20)
going over all the news today (5:18 - 5:23)
um the look the the gen 9 stuff is going (5:20 - 5:24)
to be after break we're going to get all (5:23 - 5:26)
the like lighter stuff out of the way (5:24 - 5:28)
then we'll take a break then we'll do (5:26 - 5:29)
the gen 9. obviously there's a lot to (5:28 - 5:31)
say there but that's why we want to get (5:29 - 5:33)
the other stuff out of the way first (5:31 - 5:34)
um (5:33 - 5:36)
so we're just going to go through this (5:34 - 5:39)
press release here (5:36 - 5:41)
uh and i believe they started off with (5:39 - 5:43)
pokemon go if i remember correctly (5:41 - 5:44)
yes (5:43 - 5:48)
um so this is the 26th anniversary (5:44 - 5:50)
i don't do do most most companies don't (5:48 - 5:52)
care right they care about like the 20s (5:50 - 5:54)
the 25s the 30s the 30s once you get (5:52 - 5:57)
past 10 you just care about the fives (5:54 - 5:59)
yeah yeah yeah (5:57 - 6:00)
and (5:59 - 6:02)
to be fa so i i think the one thing we (6:00 - 6:03)
didn't do (6:02 - 6:05)
is we didn't really look back on the (6:03 - 6:07)
25th and go like was that good or was (6:05 - 6:10)
that bad during it we were (6:07 - 6:11)
it was bad (6:10 - 6:13)
i think it was not bad i mean like it (6:11 - 6:15)
wasn't good (6:13 - 6:17)
they had poke new pokemon snap pokemon (6:15 - 6:18)
unite (6:17 - 6:20)
brilliant diamond shining pearl and (6:18 - 6:21)
legends (6:20 - 6:22)
that's (6:21 - 6:25)
four big games legends is this year you (6:22 - 6:28)
cannot sweep legends into 25 no no no no (6:25 - 6:30)
it's within the 25th yeah (6:28 - 6:32)
because 20 feet before the anniversary (6:30 - 6:34)
you like you didn't you when you had (6:32 - 6:36)
your anniversary dinner last night you (6:34 - 6:39)
weren't like that's for 2022 you're like (6:36 - 6:42)
four that's for between the 2021 2022. (6:39 - 6:45)
no those dates yeah that's how (6:42 - 6:47)
anniversaries work great (6:45 - 6:48)
if your birthday if my if you're if your (6:47 - 6:51)
50th birthday is in july and you get hit (6:48 - 6:53)
by a car the week before (6:51 - 6:55)
you're still 49 when you get hit by the (6:53 - 6:59)
guy why specifically those ages (6:55 - 7:02)
which are only relevant to one person (6:59 - 7:06)
recording right now but okay (7:02 - 7:08)
no they're already 50. see that it was (7:06 - 7:10)
not it was announced or the 25th it (7:08 - 7:13)
wasn't released until the 26th the 26th (7:10 - 7:14)
started this year which is the 26th (7:13 - 7:17)
anniversary the 26 started today great (7:14 - 7:19)
yeah (7:17 - 7:21)
oh so we're saying that the year (7:19 - 7:23)
anniversaries start not at the start of (7:21 - 7:25)
the year but on pokemon day correct (7:23 - 7:27)
correct yes like your birthday (7:25 - 7:30)
aren't clear so (7:27 - 7:31)
steve just revealed he has no idea how (7:30 - 7:33)
old i am (7:31 - 7:35)
yes fun no i know how old you are oh how (7:33 - 7:38)
old is he clear 47 (7:35 - 7:39)
no (7:38 - 7:42)
what (7:39 - 7:42)
i love this great let's keep on going (7:44 - 7:50)
keep perfect just dig that (7:47 - 7:52)
um (7:50 - 7:54)
i think though for (7:52 - 7:56)
i think (7:54 - 7:56)
i think pokemon unite was pretty big you (7:58 - 8:02)
know it might not have the (8:00 - 8:03)
no game is going to have the momentum of (8:02 - 8:04)
pokemon go (8:03 - 8:06)
but they're still releasing characters (8:04 - 8:07)
they're still supporting it people do (8:06 - 8:09)
still like it i think it has been in a (8:07 - 8:10)
weird place and they haven't figured out (8:09 - 8:14)
how to balance it but (8:10 - 8:16)
i i would say i had as much fun with (8:14 - 8:19)
pokemon unite that i did with people (8:16 - 8:21)
really big in the world as a whole or (8:19 - 8:23)
really big in the pokemon community i (8:21 - 8:25)
think i think four (8:23 - 8:26)
big games (8:25 - 8:29)
like i wouldn't say um i would i (8:26 - 8:30)
personally wouldn't say cafe mix is a (8:29 - 8:32)
huge game i also wouldn't say magikarp (8:30 - 8:33)
jump is a huge game i wouldn't say (8:32 - 8:36)
pokemon uh gosh what was that was that (8:33 - 8:38)
game that got canceled pokemon duel i (8:36 - 8:39)
wouldn't say those were big games but i (8:38 - 8:41)
would say unite (8:39 - 8:43)
and snap are two pretty big spin-off (8:41 - 8:45)
games and then we got you know even (8:43 - 8:46)
though (8:45 - 8:48)
i didn't like brilliant diamond shotting (8:46 - 8:50)
pearl that game meant (8:48 - 8:53)
something to some people i love it still (8:50 - 8:55)
played it was playing it this morning uh (8:53 - 8:56)
and then legends (8:55 - 8:58)
so i think i think four games in a year (8:56 - 9:00)
is great it doesn't look like that's the (8:58 - 9:03)
case this year based on this pokemon day (9:00 - 9:04)
but you never know (9:03 - 9:07)
uh it seems like hey we got one big (9:04 - 9:09)
game how many how many copies did (9:07 - 9:12)
legends arceus sell (9:09 - 9:15)
last was reported was like 6.5 okay so (9:12 - 9:17)
you haven't had an update (9:15 - 9:20)
unite so i will give you this unite (9:17 - 9:21)
when i'm reading this article which was (9:20 - 9:23)
november 27th (9:21 - 9:25)
and accumulated 9 million players so (9:23 - 9:29)
that's like 9 million copies (9:25 - 9:29)
yeah is i the hard thing is like is that (9:29 - 9:34)
active players is that most players is (9:32 - 9:35)
that just people who downloaded it it (9:34 - 9:37)
was a people who downloaded it but (9:35 - 9:39)
played one game (9:37 - 9:41)
i mean but like (9:39 - 9:42)
we don't know how much they played (9:41 - 9:45)
arceus we we have x amount of units sold (9:42 - 9:47)
11 million six million whatever i mean (9:45 - 9:49)
yeah (9:47 - 9:51)
but i think that's a fair comparison for (9:49 - 9:53)
unite so yeah i would say it's a fairly (9:51 - 9:55)
big game (9:53 - 9:57)
i i think they had a pretty good year (9:55 - 9:58)
honestly you know it probably would have (9:57 - 10:00)
been better if it wasn't for the (9:58 - 10:01)
pandemic (10:00 - 10:02)
um but (10:01 - 10:03)
four (10:02 - 10:05)
big games uh some collaborations with (10:03 - 10:07)
other companies i i thought i thought (10:05 - 10:09)
the year was pretty good (10:07 - 10:10)
i i will (10:09 - 10:13)
agree it was a good year it is not what (10:10 - 10:14)
i would have wanted for the 25th (10:13 - 10:17)
anniversary but it was it's still a good (10:14 - 10:20)
year yes (10:17 - 10:24)
so that leads into 26 years of pokemon (10:20 - 10:26)
um and the first bit of news that they (10:24 - 10:28)
started off with was a pokemon that (10:26 - 10:30)
first appeared in the alola region (10:28 - 10:32)
for the setting of pokemon sun and moon (10:30 - 10:34)
will be appearing in pokemon go at 10 (10:32 - 10:37)
a.m local time on march 1st (10:34 - 10:38)
until then you will be able to see (10:37 - 10:42)
alolan executor appearing in the wild (10:38 - 10:43)
and that was pretty much it that was (10:42 - 10:44)
like (10:43 - 10:46)
we're done with go move on are (10:44 - 10:49)
do we have all the unova and (10:46 - 10:52)
kayla's pokemon (10:49 - 10:54)
far from it okay that's what i was (10:52 - 10:56)
thinking too i was like (10:54 - 11:00)
it just kind of felt like (10:56 - 11:01)
yeah off the top of my head we don't (11:00 - 11:05)
have volcarona we don't have kecleon (11:01 - 11:07)
yeah (11:05 - 11:09)
we don't have shaman we don't have well (11:07 - 11:11)
we have darkrai we don't have manaphy we (11:09 - 11:14)
don't have fiona we do have victini (11:11 - 11:17)
uh uh but mythicals are different (11:14 - 11:19)
because you want to save those for like (11:17 - 11:21)
the yeah but they skipped over shaymin (11:19 - 11:22)
and manafee and they went right for (11:21 - 11:25)
mellowetta and faktini like (11:22 - 11:29)
that was kind of weird (11:25 - 11:29)
here's the real question we were getting (11:36 - 11:39)
volca rona (11:37 - 11:42)
i don't know volcker on a movie coming (11:39 - 11:45)
back to the theaters (11:42 - 11:47)
we don't have a go go in x and y (11:45 - 11:52)
uh skidoo and go go we don't have right (11:47 - 11:52)
um (11:52 - 11:56)
we don't have (11:53 - 11:56)
i just felt like them announcing (11:58 - 12:05)
alola and i'm like but not everybody is (12:02 - 12:06)
here yet (12:05 - 12:09)
i mean i want a cutie fly so i'm one (12:06 - 12:12)
thousand percent here for cutie fly and (12:09 - 12:14)
go but you're right because fla baby was (12:12 - 12:17)
just like oh potato was just released (12:14 - 12:20)
two weeks ago so i i i looked at it and (12:17 - 12:22)
i thought (12:20 - 12:23)
oh (12:22 - 12:26)
okay this it just felt (12:23 - 12:28)
early maybe they're just gonna do a (12:26 - 12:30)
super slow drip (12:28 - 12:32)
that's what they've been doing how (12:30 - 12:34)
slower could it get a plumber even (12:32 - 12:36)
slower than (12:34 - 12:40)
i think you know like i think (12:36 - 12:41)
the the next i i guess it's going to be (12:40 - 12:43)
called season of alola right (12:41 - 12:45)
because they (12:43 - 12:47)
uh oh instead of like season of heritage (12:45 - 12:48)
season (12:47 - 12:50)
season of heritage (12:48 - 12:52)
season yeah i that's what that was my (12:50 - 12:53)
takeaway is what's called using me (12:52 - 12:55)
called seasonal alola i guess we'll i (12:53 - 12:58)
mean by the time this podcast comes out (12:55 - 12:59)
season of islands (12:58 - 13:02)
island living (12:59 - 13:02)
margaritaville um (13:05 - 13:11)
i proof i the (13:08 - 13:13)
is here's my here's my guess (13:11 - 13:15)
we'll we'll get the three starters (13:13 - 13:16)
they'll be a little bit more rare in the (13:15 - 13:18)
wild but not impossible for whatever (13:16 - 13:20)
reason when they did the calo starters (13:18 - 13:22)
they made froakie slightly more rare (13:20 - 13:24)
than everyone else um makes sense (13:22 - 13:26)
because people like genuinely like (13:24 - 13:28)
greninja greninja is cool i i have no (13:26 - 13:30)
qualms with greninja he's a he's a cool (13:28 - 13:34)
boy his uh tongue is a scarf very cool (13:30 - 13:36)
that's the part i hate the most (13:34 - 13:38)
uh what what are we getting like patrat (13:36 - 13:41)
or not patrat young goose and (13:38 - 13:43)
pikapec and what cutie fly and then (13:41 - 13:44)
that's it and then we'll probably have (13:43 - 13:46)
to wait a month for like two other (13:44 - 13:47)
pokemon (13:46 - 13:50)
um i tried to think yeah kitty fly is on (13:47 - 13:53)
that first island (13:50 - 13:55)
pikapec (13:53 - 13:57)
young goose and who else is on the first (13:55 - 13:59)
island that was new (13:57 - 14:01)
maybe (13:59 - 14:03)
uh maybe the fighter crab what what is (14:01 - 14:05)
its name oh bro (14:03 - 14:07)
brawler but we already have yeah but (14:05 - 14:08)
they won't give us away at all we have (14:07 - 14:11)
like the alolan forms of (14:08 - 14:14)
the canto right we have a bunch of the (14:11 - 14:15)
alolan forms (14:14 - 14:17)
so they'll get away with being like ah (14:15 - 14:18)
here's vulpix in the wild like i'm sick (14:17 - 14:19)
of full pigs (14:18 - 14:21)
[Laughter] (14:19 - 14:22)
well just like they did with like the (14:21 - 14:24)
alolan exeggutor and it's like are they (14:22 - 14:26)
going to introduce (14:24 - 14:28)
an alola stone so you can take any of (14:26 - 14:31)
your cubones and make them although (14:28 - 14:33)
yeah i don't know i guess i guess we'll (14:31 - 14:35)
see marowak come back in raids right (14:33 - 14:36)
unless (14:35 - 14:37)
i don't know i mean i would like to be (14:36 - 14:40)
able to turn my shiny cube into my (14:37 - 14:42)
favorite (14:40 - 14:43)
it would be nice to be able to turn a (14:42 - 14:45)
shiny pikachu into an alolan raichu that (14:43 - 14:47)
would be nice (14:45 - 14:49)
uh my guess though given the pattern (14:47 - 14:51)
that they may do that with an alola (14:49 - 14:53)
stone right like we have sinnoh stones (14:51 - 14:55)
we have unova stones (14:53 - 14:57)
it's time give me that speaking of (14:55 - 14:58)
stones though i think the summer thing (14:57 - 15:01)
is z crystals (14:58 - 15:03)
like what (15:01 - 15:04)
gimmick (15:03 - 15:07)
can they do to continue (15:04 - 15:10)
to carry on (15:07 - 15:12)
why you would need so here's the thing (15:10 - 15:14)
like we still have we still have this (15:12 - 15:15)
conversation where people are like what (15:14 - 15:18)
happens when i run out of pokemon that (15:15 - 15:20)
doesn't matter they've already proven (15:18 - 15:22)
for six years that drip feeding one (15:20 - 15:25)
pokemon a month people still are playing (15:22 - 15:27)
this game yeah it doesn't matter when we (15:25 - 15:28)
run out of pokemon they'll just throw (15:27 - 15:30)
hats on it they'll just take them away (15:28 - 15:33)
they'll reintroduce them like (15:30 - 15:35)
nothing was new in the johto tour i (15:33 - 15:38)
don't know why i did 20 lugia raids and (15:35 - 15:40)
40 ho-oh raids i did those five years (15:38 - 15:43)
ago i did just you're there either i was (15:40 - 15:44)
there (15:43 - 15:46)
why are you doing this i was there they (15:44 - 15:49)
were there and i also i did not do i (15:46 - 15:52)
just did amazing raids i i was like i (15:49 - 15:55)
needed to look lugia me and lugia we got (15:52 - 15:57)
that (15:55 - 15:58)
we're gonna get another one none of them (15:57 - 16:01)
shined for me although i did get a shiny (15:58 - 16:04)
suicune and they got a shiny (16:01 - 16:06)
raikou okay (16:04 - 16:09)
uh okay so back to the z crystal i did (16:06 - 16:11)
do you think it would be (16:09 - 16:14)
a crystal that you can add a f an a (16:11 - 16:17)
fourth move like (16:14 - 16:17)
i want (16:18 - 16:20)
i think (16:19 - 16:22)
i think you'll be able to use it in a (16:20 - 16:27)
raid to do big damage to a boss (16:22 - 16:30)
and you will have to collect (16:27 - 16:32)
something like like how you collect the (16:30 - 16:34)
mega energy (16:32 - 16:36)
you will have to collect (16:34 - 16:39)
z energy that is the worst idea i like (16:36 - 16:41)
my idea better but this is what i'm (16:39 - 16:43)
thinking right like you collect the (16:41 - 16:44)
energy (16:43 - 16:46)
so you can (16:44 - 16:48)
need less people because you'll be able (16:46 - 16:50)
to do because you did the work to (16:48 - 16:52)
collect the energy you'd be like oh we (16:50 - 16:55)
need four people to do it i don't worry (16:52 - 16:58)
brother and sister i have plenty of z (16:55 - 17:00)
crystal power i'll be able to (16:58 - 17:02)
i'm out all right it's going to be (17:00 - 17:04)
another thing you can it could be called (17:02 - 17:06)
the triple z crystal because i fell (17:04 - 17:08)
asleep at the thought of having to do (17:06 - 17:09)
this you see what i'm saying though they (17:08 - 17:11)
gotta get i see what you're saying i (17:09 - 17:12)
think it's a terrible idea i hope they (17:11 - 17:14)
don't go that way yeah i mean i don't (17:12 - 17:16)
think i think introducing the pokemon is (17:14 - 17:19)
enough they don't have to do a special (17:16 - 17:21)
feature i think they're doing a gimmick (17:19 - 17:23)
i they got to do a gimmick (17:21 - 17:25)
they don't got to do nothing but they (17:23 - 17:27)
got to do it for people to be like (17:25 - 17:29)
gimmick (17:27 - 17:30)
they gotta do a gimmick for people to be (17:29 - 17:31)
like oh this seems cool i want to come (17:30 - 17:34)
back or hey this is another thing i can (17:31 - 17:36)
grind or hey this is another thing i can (17:34 - 17:38)
collect as we can figure out how can (17:36 - 17:39)
they make money out of it and then (17:38 - 17:41)
correct that (17:39 - 17:42)
here's the thing i do not want to be in (17:41 - 17:45)
mall of america (17:42 - 17:48)
on ho and tour (17:45 - 17:51)
having to listen to steve scream about z (17:48 - 17:52)
crystals (17:51 - 17:55)
oh who you see crystalline what secrets (17:52 - 17:56)
are you gonna do no you gotta do grass (17:55 - 17:58)
grassy crystal this time grass grass (17:56 - 18:00)
grass you you're doing grass you do (17:58 - 18:02)
grass you do fire you do electric get (18:00 - 18:04)
the get the crystals get the crystal why (18:02 - 18:06)
aren't you getting crystals i think i (18:04 - 18:09)
look i think mega pokemon in go are (18:06 - 18:10)
a million times more useful than they (18:09 - 18:12)
ever were in the main series game i (18:10 - 18:14)
don't disagree mega evolved (18:12 - 18:17)
and didn't use it once (18:14 - 18:19)
we're getting extra candy every raid (18:17 - 18:20)
just because you had them (18:19 - 18:22)
what candy (18:20 - 18:25)
extra the the pokemon candy like if you (18:22 - 18:27)
did a lugia you would get extra lugia (18:25 - 18:29)
candy (18:27 - 18:29)
and i almost had a heart attack yeah (18:40 - 18:46)
that i uh i am i am in wills spread your (18:43 - 18:48)
rear crate is how you want it and you (18:46 - 18:49)
know what's the here's the thing it's (18:48 - 18:51)
like oh you can easily pop that box and (18:49 - 18:54)
get 30 mil tans and pineapples (18:51 - 18:58)
guess what's never to happen no box (18:54 - 18:59)
in this house (18:58 - 19:02)
there's no box poppin (18:59 - 19:05)
sale i melt hand at one point in my life (19:02 - 19:07)
i mail meddled at one point in my life (19:05 - 19:09)
transferred it into let's go pikachu and (19:07 - 19:11)
done (19:09 - 19:13)
moved on (19:11 - 19:13)
before we move off go (19:14 - 19:18)
johto tour give me your thoughts (19:16 - 19:20)
starting with greg (19:18 - 19:21)
why (19:20 - 19:25)
does dunsparce not appear in the wild (19:21 - 19:27)
the one (19:25 - 19:32)
one thing i wanted a chance a chance a (19:27 - 19:36)
chance at a shiny dunsparce in the i (19:32 - 19:37)
would have (19:36 - 19:41)
cancelled my anniversary (19:37 - 19:43)
on the chance that there would have been (19:41 - 19:46)
a pink cutie somewhere and it never (19:43 - 19:49)
spawned there was no spawns what garbage (19:46 - 19:51)
i got three the entire day (19:49 - 19:53)
not spawns but they were like from like (19:51 - 19:55)
no i got two i got a spawn off an (19:53 - 19:57)
incense but i got there was like a (19:55 - 20:00)
mission that gave you one that popped up (19:57 - 20:03)
i think there was two missions (20:00 - 20:05)
is that appearing in the wild all day (20:03 - 20:07)
like all the others (20:05 - 20:10)
i you you know the the (20:07 - 20:12)
the selection of pokemon was a bit weird (20:10 - 20:15)
but also johto is pretty (20:12 - 20:16)
limited it's hard for me it's like i (20:15 - 20:19)
will say going into jojo like johto is (20:16 - 20:21)
my lead like (20:19 - 20:24)
unequivocally my least favorite gen so (20:21 - 20:26)
i was just much more there to be like (20:24 - 20:28)
i'm with my friends and i will catch (20:26 - 20:31)
what i catch there wasn't anything other (20:28 - 20:32)
than dunsparce said i was like i kind of (20:31 - 20:35)
want this as shiny um (20:32 - 20:37)
i'm happy with a few that i got i had a (20:35 - 20:40)
good day but there's nothing about johto (20:37 - 20:43)
or the pokemon from johto that i'm ever (20:40 - 20:45)
all that enthused about (20:43 - 20:47)
well except cyndaquil of course (20:45 - 20:48)
well yeah but either we heard the (20:47 - 20:50)
communication today and you and i spent (20:48 - 20:51)
the entire day having a great time (20:50 - 20:54)
catching our buddy yep (20:51 - 20:56)
we need to replicate that a couple weird (20:54 - 20:59)
so there was a bunch of babies and they (20:56 - 21:01)
put the babies in 2ks which is like (20:59 - 21:03)
understandable and on a day that you're (21:01 - 21:05)
supposed to be like walking and getting (21:03 - 21:07)
out and it was one-fourth egg distance (21:05 - 21:09)
or something you could be hatching even (21:07 - 21:11)
if you didn't buy any incubators (21:09 - 21:13)
by the way i bought incubators what uh (21:11 - 21:16)
what (21:13 - 21:16)
i would have had more fun just starting (21:18 - 21:23)
15 on fire that is (21:20 - 21:25)
even worse than what bobby would do now (21:23 - 21:27)
that i said that i would have had more (21:25 - 21:28)
fun starting 15 on fire i do wanted to (21:27 - 21:32)
disclose niantic did pay for my ticket (21:28 - 21:35)
too and technically mine i think (21:32 - 21:37)
yes technically greg they got paid back (21:35 - 21:39)
because i saw how much money you spent (21:37 - 21:41)
last night when you needed more raid (21:39 - 21:44)
passes they sure did okay but the the (21:41 - 21:45)
thing is you're already limited with a (21:44 - 21:48)
pokedex i get that you're like skarmory (21:45 - 21:50)
for this game man teen for this game (21:48 - 21:52)
also it's mantine not mankind because (21:50 - 21:55)
it's like tyke teen teen as a teenager (21:52 - 21:56)
fan fee for this game (21:55 - 22:00)
uh man tight came after i know but yeah (21:56 - 22:02)
but it's that that's how they said look (22:00 - 22:04)
within where's the man an adult (22:02 - 22:07)
man dalt will come in gen 9 don't spoil (22:04 - 22:10)
it greg oh my god there's no gen 9 yet (22:07 - 22:13)
um man don't like mandel's the worst (22:10 - 22:16)
but they put (22:13 - 22:20)
quill fish in 7k eggs so i saw me like (22:16 - 22:23)
oh you can only get so many 7k eggs and (22:20 - 22:25)
i know this because you can only open (22:23 - 22:27)
gifts to get 7k eggs and i opened so (22:25 - 22:29)
many gifts they were like you can't open (22:27 - 22:30)
any more any more gifts and i was like (22:29 - 22:33)
i'm not going to waste a super incubator (22:30 - 22:34)
on a 2k egg i was using my super (22:33 - 22:38)
incubators on 7k eggs so my my chances (22:34 - 22:39)
of quail fish are literally out the (22:38 - 22:42)
window now and dunsparce was that like (22:39 - 22:44)
where was dunsparce where was quillfish (22:42 - 22:46)
why (22:44 - 22:48)
i thought if anything giraffe right (22:46 - 22:49)
would have been rare and they they had a (22:48 - 22:51)
whole hour dedicated to draft rig (22:49 - 22:54)
they put that boy everywhere (22:51 - 22:56)
also i'm going to take an argument with (22:54 - 22:59)
your man teen (22:56 - 23:01)
because it is often believed that it's (22:59 - 23:03)
manta ray (23:01 - 23:06)
and brine which is tine (23:03 - 23:07)
look (23:06 - 23:09)
i'm going off the 3d pro (23:07 - 23:11)
the pokemon battle revolution sereby's (23:09 - 23:13)
pronunciation guide (23:11 - 23:17)
and the anime they all say mantine (23:13 - 23:17)
that's what i got (23:20 - 23:23)
i liked the five zones i liked the five (23:26 - 23:31)
zones five zones again two hours of (23:28 - 23:34)
whatever at the end (23:31 - 23:37)
i liked what they did with the trainers (23:34 - 23:39)
so in the canton (23:37 - 23:41)
yeah yeah (23:39 - 23:41)
like in the kanto they had it where like (23:43 - 23:48)
the trainers would just be everywhere (23:46 - 23:49)
like team rocket and they were kind of (23:48 - 23:51)
annoying and sometimes pokemon would (23:49 - 23:54)
spawn underneath them and in this it was (23:51 - 23:56)
like you had to do the eight trainers in (23:54 - 23:59)
order which was kind of cool and then it (23:56 - 24:00)
was one at a time (23:59 - 24:02)
um and once you got past that first (24:00 - 24:03)
mission which i never did because i was (24:02 - 24:05)
like for three hours i was like where (24:03 - 24:06)
are these trainers i just never did the (24:05 - 24:07)
first mission once you did the first (24:06 - 24:09)
mission they pop up they weren't (24:07 - 24:11)
terribly hard to find right no well (24:09 - 24:14)
i struggled finding (24:11 - 24:16)
the dragon one like the dragon one just (24:14 - 24:19)
would not pop for me i spent (24:16 - 24:21)
i would say i spent (24:19 - 24:24)
40 minutes trying to find it and it (24:21 - 24:27)
finally happened so i don't know (24:24 - 24:28)
what (24:27 - 24:32)
requirements were needed but it took a (24:28 - 24:34)
um the other thing is i liked that they (24:32 - 24:36)
did the raikou entei suicune i thought (24:34 - 24:39)
that was like really fun it was exciting (24:36 - 24:41)
to see them i like that they ran that (24:39 - 24:43)
was like you know part of the old games (24:41 - 24:46)
unless they were shiny like mine i think (24:43 - 24:49)
they did a bad job so they did two (24:46 - 24:50)
things that i think were bad for (24:49 - 24:53)
consumers directly number one is they (24:50 - 24:55)
didn't overly communicate that (24:53 - 24:58)
espeon needed to be evolved before 6pm (24:55 - 25:00)
and if you did not do that you did not (24:58 - 25:03)
complete your evolutionary quests (25:00 - 25:05)
and it had to be your buddy i'm pretty (25:03 - 25:07)
sure it did but you did not need to do (25:05 - 25:09)
the walking requirement right and i (25:07 - 25:11)
think they did a bad job at saying hey (25:09 - 25:13)
when you find these wild (25:11 - 25:15)
uh (25:13 - 25:17)
legendary pokemon you need to take a (25:15 - 25:19)
picture of them and then you can catch (25:17 - 25:22)
them like normally yeah uh which was (25:19 - 25:23)
like i think they kind of dropped the (25:22 - 25:24)
ball in the communication there with (25:23 - 25:26)
those two things i do think those two (25:24 - 25:30)
things were good um but (25:26 - 25:32)
if you didn't read that quest very (25:30 - 25:34)
carefully yeah you missed the whole (25:32 - 25:36)
taking a picture part which is i missed (25:34 - 25:38)
it first i'm like oh i'm supposed to (25:36 - 25:42)
take a picture of them in the wild (25:38 - 25:43)
well yeah and which also like you could (25:42 - 25:45)
have taken a picture of them if you beat (25:43 - 25:48)
them in a raid and that's right (25:45 - 25:50)
that counts really in the wild because (25:48 - 25:52)
yeah it was in a raid now you paid the (25:50 - 25:55)
dollar yeah i didn't i mean i had so (25:52 - 25:58)
many extra raid passes stored up but (25:55 - 26:00)
uh well you were only going to stay till (25:58 - 26:03)
about 3 p.m you ended up staying until 9 (26:00 - 26:06)
00 pm how was your day i had an accident (26:03 - 26:07)
um (26:06 - 26:09)
but (26:07 - 26:13)
my only soul review of the entire day (26:09 - 26:15)
is this (26:13 - 26:17)
i would have won (26:15 - 26:19)
i would have had (26:17 - 26:22)
two years in a row (26:19 - 26:25)
winning the tour day (26:22 - 26:27)
and (26:25 - 26:27)
i want to quote liam neeson but i never (26:28 - 26:32)
saw the movie so i can't say it exactly (26:30 - 26:33)
but (26:32 - 26:35)
i will find out (26:33 - 26:36)
who put (26:35 - 26:37)
the (26:36 - 26:38)
mossy lure (26:37 - 26:40)
or whatever that it's called (26:38 - 26:43)
at the food court (26:40 - 26:45)
at the mall of america (26:43 - 26:47)
so that when my alarm went off at 6 00 (26:45 - 26:48)
p.m (26:47 - 26:51)
so that i could evolve that eevee into (26:48 - 26:53)
umbreon which was the last thing that i (26:51 - 26:55)
needed to do to finish (26:53 - 26:57)
all the quests all the quests for the (26:55 - 27:00)
day which i had (26:57 - 27:00)
and i couldn't do it because it wanted (27:00 - 27:05)
to turn into a leafeon (27:02 - 27:08)
i'm gonna harm that person (27:05 - 27:09)
so bad so (27:08 - 27:11)
by that (27:09 - 27:14)
who won so the saddest moment of the day (27:11 - 27:16)
was me getting a text (27:14 - 27:17)
from greg (27:16 - 27:19)
showing that he had finished the (27:17 - 27:21)
evolution thing which was the last thing (27:19 - 27:23)
that we had to finish (27:21 - 27:25)
and my only reply to that i can't say (27:23 - 27:29)
on this program it was fantastic (27:25 - 27:29)
and (27:30 - 27:33)
said i'm stuck with a mossy lure and (27:30 - 27:38)
then i text back ha ha ha get wrecked (27:33 - 27:39)
i would (27:38 - 27:40)
have (27:39 - 27:41)
won (27:40 - 27:42)
that's (27:41 - 27:45)
i i mean it was you all walk too much my (27:42 - 27:48)
feet were hurting i i thought i had worn (27:45 - 27:51)
the good shoes but i didn't (27:48 - 27:52)
um (27:51 - 27:55)
but i mean as as usual with pokemon go (27:52 - 27:57)
events for me it's just the opportunity (27:55 - 27:59)
to hang out and have weird experiences (27:57 - 28:01)
with my friends and i certainly had (27:59 - 28:04)
plenty of that yesterday so (28:01 - 28:05)
oh to the person that stopped by and (28:04 - 28:08)
said hi hi sorry yeah (28:05 - 28:10)
it was it was a wild day (28:08 - 28:12)
uh next time just sort of hang around a (28:10 - 28:13)
little bit and talk for a bit because we (28:12 - 28:15)
could have stopped i know that's that's (28:13 - 28:16)
i said (28:15 - 28:18)
if you see us especially if you see the (28:16 - 28:20)
three of us in public together you are (28:18 - 28:22)
allowed to come and say (28:20 - 28:24)
a few words maybe not monopolize our (28:22 - 28:26)
time for an hour and a half but maybe (28:24 - 28:28)
like five minutes of conversation is (28:26 - 28:31)
allowable like i barely clocked a person (28:28 - 28:33)
was there before it was over yeah and i (28:31 - 28:36)
feel bad that it didn't say hi or (28:33 - 28:39)
find out what your name was or (28:36 - 28:40)
so (28:39 - 28:43)
hello person i hope you had a good (28:40 - 28:46)
community day uh we're at the mall of (28:43 - 28:49)
america bunch (28:46 - 28:51)
say hi (28:49 - 28:51)
i i think at least for me it was worth (28:52 - 28:56)
the (28:55 - 28:57)
whatever (28:56 - 28:59)
what was the cost of the ticket 12 bucks (28:57 - 29:02)
free free for you clearly free for me (28:59 - 29:04)
well not free for me i spent a hundred (29:02 - 29:05)
dollars (29:04 - 29:07)
you made like other 10 (29:05 - 29:08)
or something like that (29:07 - 29:12)
uh yeah i i i'd be hard-pressed to find (29:08 - 29:14)
somebody that didn't have a great time (29:12 - 29:16)
because it's not like it's not like (29:14 - 29:17)
there was any secrets you kind of knew (29:16 - 29:19)
exactly what you were paying for up (29:17 - 29:20)
front it's (29:19 - 29:23)
there was no surprises i thought you (29:20 - 29:24)
know i was a little worried there was (29:23 - 29:26)
going to be a lot of like starters or a (29:24 - 29:29)
lot of just repeat stuff (29:26 - 29:31)
um like marie i thought marie was going (29:29 - 29:32)
to litter everywhere i think they did a (29:31 - 29:35)
really good job with 100 pokemon and (29:32 - 29:37)
spacing them out appropriately over the (29:35 - 29:38)
five hours i mean obviously they had to (29:37 - 29:40)
put in gen 1 pokemon too because (29:38 - 29:43)
there were a lot of genuine pokemon and (29:40 - 29:46)
there were relatively no duns bars so (29:43 - 29:48)
you could have swapped out dunsparce's (29:46 - 29:50)
little fish were the two weird one of (29:48 - 29:51)
those (29:50 - 29:53)
one of those (29:51 - 29:54)
for kantos (29:53 - 29:56)
dunny spars please (29:54 - 29:57)
uh (29:56 - 30:01)
yeah so i i thought it was a good event (29:57 - 30:04)
i had a great time i ended up walking 10 (30:01 - 30:06)
miles i went up 2.5 million experience (30:04 - 30:08)
so overall (30:06 - 30:10)
pretty happy (30:08 - 30:11)
um (30:10 - 30:13)
but yeah sun and moon stuff is now (30:11 - 30:14)
coming (30:13 - 30:16)
uh we'll move on to the next bit here in (30:14 - 30:19)
the presents which was there's an (30:16 - 30:22)
ongoing pokemon event in pokemon masters (30:19 - 30:25)
ex or they are celebrating the 2.5 year (30:22 - 30:27)
anniversary since the game was released (30:25 - 30:29)
if you logged in well i don't actually (30:27 - 30:30)
know if this will be available but if (30:29 - 30:32)
you log in on pokemon day you will get 3 (30:30 - 30:35)
000 gems for free they're also doing 10 (30:32 - 30:38)
sink pairs a day for 10 days at no cost (30:35 - 30:40)
so they're doing another 100 freesync (30:38 - 30:42)
pairs yeah um (30:40 - 30:43)
and then uh (30:42 - 30:45)
may skyla and (30:43 - 30:48)
ryhan will be appearing in special (30:45 - 30:49)
outfits those are like the three (30:48 - 30:52)
characters this year (30:49 - 30:53)
and (30:52 - 30:54)
they said are you gonna call these the (30:53 - 30:56)
bait characters for what's coming up on (30:54 - 30:58)
the third because you called sigma suit (30:56 - 31:00)
leon bait (30:58 - 31:04)
um i'm not a huge may fan i don't really (31:00 - 31:05)
care about her that much i like the (31:04 - 31:07)
skyla though i like tornadoes i i like (31:05 - 31:09)
skyla i think ralph is great the thing (31:07 - 31:12)
about (31:09 - 31:14)
skyla getting a new partner (31:12 - 31:17)
is it has to be way better than the (31:14 - 31:20)
skyla is now because (31:17 - 31:24)
current skyla is s tier always bring (31:20 - 31:27)
super powered so (31:24 - 31:29)
if you want it to be used that tornadoes (31:27 - 31:31)
had better do do everything that swanna (31:29 - 31:32)
can do (31:31 - 31:35)
and more or nobody's going to use it (31:32 - 31:38)
but but here's the thing for me (31:35 - 31:41)
and they said this in the in the (31:38 - 31:45)
the presents is they have 142 characters (31:41 - 31:47)
yeah i just like collecting the (31:45 - 31:50)
characters yeah (31:47 - 31:52)
um so you know i pull out a banner if i (31:50 - 31:54)
get one i move to the next banner (31:52 - 31:56)
a lot of characters are optimal at three (31:54 - 31:58)
you know you need for maybe those that (31:56 - 32:00)
don't play masters you can collect a (31:58 - 32:02)
character up to five times so every time (32:00 - 32:04)
so if you got two grimsleys (32:02 - 32:06)
you're now great they've like merged (32:04 - 32:07)
together and now your grimsley's like (32:06 - 32:09)
slightly better (32:07 - 32:11)
but at when you get three of a character (32:09 - 32:14)
it unlocks like their little sink grid a (32:11 - 32:16)
little bit better it unlocks the entire (32:14 - 32:17)
sync grid so (32:16 - 32:19)
when they're level one you can only go (32:17 - 32:22)
so far in your build out level two opens (32:19 - 32:25)
a few more options level three (32:22 - 32:28)
every every option in the sync grid is (32:25 - 32:29)
open so you can customize (32:28 - 32:31)
they (32:29 - 32:33)
they will max out at level five as far (32:31 - 32:35)
as stats (32:33 - 32:37)
but the stats don't matter as much as (32:35 - 32:39)
having a full secret (32:37 - 32:41)
so people say like (32:39 - 32:42)
three out of three is where you want to (32:41 - 32:44)
be because that's where you get the full (32:42 - 32:46)
secret and you can make (32:44 - 32:48)
them you can make the most choices and (32:46 - 32:51)
actually like customize more but there (32:48 - 32:52)
are still (32:51 - 32:55)
stat boosts that go up until they're 5 (32:52 - 32:56)
out of five (32:55 - 32:57)
yeah (32:56 - 33:00)
um also (32:57 - 33:00)
pokemon masters victory road is the best (33:02 - 33:11)
tutorial about how to play their game (33:06 - 33:13)
that i've seen in a mobile game in a (33:11 - 33:15)
very long time and they give you five (33:13 - 33:16)
thousand jobs and they give you five (33:15 - 33:19)
thousand gems at the end and they give (33:16 - 33:21)
you one of the (33:19 - 33:23)
sigma suits (33:21 - 33:26)
trio but i decided to just try it so i'm (33:23 - 33:28)
like okay well how good like i want to (33:26 - 33:30)
see what this is um you don't have to (33:28 - 33:32)
have (33:30 - 33:34)
anything you don't have to have super (33:32 - 33:36)
powerful pairs you don't everything is (33:34 - 33:40)
rental they give you scenarios they walk (33:36 - 33:41)
you through (33:40 - 33:44)
how the game is actually played and what (33:41 - 33:46)
all the things that are confusing mean (33:44 - 33:48)
is it just like a tutorial of like you (33:46 - 33:51)
hitting the auto button no (33:48 - 33:53)
you (33:51 - 33:53)
of the fact that you're using the (33:57 - 34:02)
rentals and the move pools are (33:59 - 34:04)
are specifically configured for you to (34:02 - 34:07)
have to do what they're asking you to do (34:04 - 34:09)
and that's not hard as long as you're (34:07 - 34:12)
reading they're like okay this is what (34:09 - 34:14)
this means so make sure that you do this (34:12 - 34:16)
as long as you do that you'll get (34:14 - 34:18)
through it easy but it is such an (34:16 - 34:21)
elegant way that they (34:18 - 34:23)
tell you about the finer parts of how (34:21 - 34:26)
their battling system works (34:23 - 34:28)
and at the end you still don't have to (34:26 - 34:30)
do the hard content but at least finally (34:28 - 34:33)
gives you a reason to say now that i (34:30 - 34:34)
understand (34:33 - 34:37)
how i'm supposed to play this game (34:34 - 34:40)
and what these various things mean (34:37 - 34:42)
uh because they also added in the (34:40 - 34:45)
special and physical symbols now i saw (34:42 - 34:47)
that i saw that so (34:45 - 34:49)
now you know like before you couldn't (34:47 - 34:52)
ever tell like okay (34:49 - 34:52)
i think you could tell on the card (34:52 - 34:55)
before you went into battle of like oh (34:54 - 34:57)
that's a physical unit this is a special (34:55 - 35:01)
unit but um sometimes they had (34:57 - 35:03)
different moves so they're mixed so you (35:01 - 35:04)
never really knew like well what are (35:03 - 35:07)
they using the most what is my enemy (35:04 - 35:09)
using the most because it now shows what (35:07 - 35:12)
the enemy is so like you can focus on (35:09 - 35:14)
well i now know it focuses on physical (35:12 - 35:16)
attack so i want to bring a unit that (35:14 - 35:18)
ups defense (35:16 - 35:21)
um and so the victory road walks you (35:18 - 35:24)
through all of that and it's (35:21 - 35:25)
i actually just i (35:24 - 35:27)
did the whole thing i'm like this is (35:25 - 35:30)
really clever this is well done the (35:27 - 35:33)
rewards are great the storyline is fun (35:30 - 35:35)
you see a bunch of people you get to (35:33 - 35:37)
talk to a bunch of people (35:35 - 35:38)
um (35:37 - 35:39)
it's a really (35:38 - 35:40)
like (35:39 - 35:43)
for as much as i rag on master sometimes (35:40 - 35:45)
like this was (35:43 - 35:48)
incredibly well implemented and i'm i am (35:45 - 35:50)
very proud of what they did there (35:48 - 35:53)
because it was i'm like this is what (35:50 - 35:55)
this needed to be and more games need to (35:53 - 35:58)
do this if you want more people to play (35:55 - 36:00)
the harder content (35:58 - 36:02)
yeah i think like (36:00 - 36:04)
5000 gems is a real good incentive to do (36:02 - 36:06)
something that they're pretty much (36:04 - 36:09)
like guaranteeing you not to fail at (36:06 - 36:10)
um (36:09 - 36:11)
and i i would (36:10 - 36:12)
i would probably (36:11 - 36:15)
wager if if you're you're not (36:12 - 36:17)
if you're if you're if you're like me (36:15 - 36:18)
and you like collecting characters and (36:17 - 36:20)
you do better like i i've done some of (36:18 - 36:22)
the legendary arenas and i've done them (36:20 - 36:24)
fine and that when i have time to sit (36:22 - 36:26)
down and like do it like it is enjoyable (36:24 - 36:28)
i don't make it a priority because other (36:26 - 36:30)
games exist (36:28 - 36:32)
and like i like pokemon go a whole lot (36:30 - 36:34)
so that's like my normal default game (36:32 - 36:38)
but i would wager if if you (36:34 - 36:40)
don't have any desire to even get the (36:38 - 36:44)
5000 gems and sit through victory road (36:40 - 36:45)
i don't know what else is going to (36:44 - 36:47)
convince you to like enjoy this game (36:45 - 36:48)
like they're really being like this is (36:47 - 36:50)
how you play it because we want you to (36:48 - 36:51)
enjoy it (36:50 - 36:52)
um (36:51 - 36:53)
yeah i don't know what else they can do (36:52 - 36:56)
really at that point no you know (36:53 - 36:57)
i don't think they have a problem with (36:56 - 36:59)
people just like me (36:57 - 37:00)
no buying gems pulling characters and (36:59 - 37:03)
that's fine i don't know that's fine but (37:00 - 37:07)
it is nice to see a game that says (37:03 - 37:09)
our game has gotten complex (37:07 - 37:12)
and the harder content does require a (37:09 - 37:14)
level of attention that nothing else in (37:12 - 37:16)
the game needs so (37:14 - 37:19)
here's how you do that if you (37:16 - 37:22)
if at the end of this you find that oh i (37:19 - 37:23)
really like (37:22 - 37:25)
what you showed me and i think this (37:23 - 37:27)
could be fun it's a great way to get (37:25 - 37:29)
started (37:27 - 37:29)
the next announcement after that wait (37:30 - 37:33)
wait wait wait by one comment on post (37:31 - 37:37)
pokemon masters the the announcement (37:33 - 37:39)
it really aggravated me that they (37:37 - 37:41)
completely validated steve's (37:39 - 37:43)
pronunciation of ryhan (37:41 - 37:46)
i'm like y'all could have said ryan (37:43 - 37:48)
but no (37:46 - 37:51)
no you you went with ryhan and now (37:48 - 37:52)
you have (37:51 - 37:54)
uh i'm never playing sword and shield (37:52 - 37:56)
ever again (37:54 - 37:56)
um there's another pronunciation that (37:57 - 38:01)
they did too that really satisfied me uh (37:59 - 38:02)
the next (38:01 - 38:05)
it was it was a slash because everyone (38:02 - 38:07)
says ages slash but it's e just slash (38:05 - 38:09)
with an e (38:07 - 38:10)
um (38:09 - 38:13)
next one was pokemon cafe mix remix (38:10 - 38:14)
unfortunately i don't think the three of (38:13 - 38:16)
us play this game at all but they they (38:14 - 38:18)
did three updates to it there was a log (38:16 - 38:21)
in bonus of uh the celebrity the (38:18 - 38:26)
celebrity crown outfit for bulbasaur (38:21 - 38:27)
which you can get from (38:26 - 38:31)
available until tuesday march 8th (38:27 - 38:34)

chance for (38:34 - 38:41)
piplup and that will go until march 1st (38:35 - 38:43)
which is very soon so that must i think (38:41 - 38:45)
that actually started on the whenever (38:43 - 38:46)
they had it on the calendar do you (38:45 - 38:49)
remember that pokemon day calendar yep (38:46 - 38:51)
uh and then an opportunity to use the (38:49 - 38:54)
new delivery feature 11 times at no cost (38:51 - 38:57)
until march 8th i believe the delivery (38:54 - 38:58)
feature is their gotcha feature that (38:57 - 39:01)
they added yes (38:58 - 39:02)
um (39:01 - 39:04)
and that's how you get victini will now (39:02 - 39:06)
let me tell you if yeah if you think (39:04 - 39:09)
pokemon go is money grabby if you think (39:06 - 39:12)
pokemon masters is money grabby let me (39:09 - 39:16)
introduce you to cafe remix (39:12 - 39:16)
the remix was let's remix the way of (39:18 - 39:24)
getting your money easier (39:21 - 39:24)
um (39:25 - 39:28)
[Music] (39:25 - 39:29)
then uh (39:28 - 39:31)
the other bit of news here is pokemon (39:29 - 39:35)
unite uh they announced hoopa last week (39:31 - 39:36)
for (39:35 - 39:38)
whatever was that thursday i think they (39:36 - 39:40)
announced the mythical pokemon hoopa (39:38 - 39:42)
um you can play pretty much any (39:40 - 39:44)
character for free (39:42 - 39:46)
uh for the next couple days you can also (39:44 - 39:48)
there's a logging event for pokemon day (39:46 - 39:50)
if you log in one day you get a hat if (39:48 - 39:52)
you log in the second day you get a (39:50 - 39:54)
shirt totally free you have until march (39:52 - 39:57)
5th 14th to do that (39:54 - 40:01)
and then they announced uh duradon as (39:57 - 40:03)
the next pokemon coming (40:01 - 40:05)
they've been doing one pokemon a month (40:03 - 40:07)
so i'm guessing doraldon is just next (40:05 - 40:08)
month (40:07 - 40:10)
uh the interesting thing about hoopa is (40:08 - 40:13)
it seems to be a pretty unique character (40:10 - 40:15)
compared to other characters that can (40:13 - 40:19)
uh warp characters around (40:15 - 40:22)
i've heard it's broken i don't know if (40:19 - 40:24)
that's a good broken or a bad broken (40:22 - 40:26)
everybody says it's broken (40:24 - 40:29)
i just want to know why hoopa is eating (40:26 - 40:33)
so many donuts on the pokemon unite site (40:29 - 40:37)
you know uh (40:33 - 40:37)
pokemon brilliant diamond shining pearl (40:38 - 40:45)
so i re like are we gonna do uh a unite (40:42 - 40:46)
night (40:45 - 40:49)
i i do want to do unite yes i would like (40:46 - 40:51)
to experi i would like to see what's (40:49 - 40:54)
happening in that game um (40:51 - 40:56)
i don't know if it's any much any better (40:54 - 40:58)
but maybe people will come back because (40:56 - 41:00)
every character is free and (40:58 - 41:02)
see what's happening there (41:00 - 41:03)
uh (41:02 - 41:05)
i know there's a small cramer ant event (41:03 - 41:07)
that's going on where at the end you get (41:05 - 41:09)
a slow bro that has nothing to do with (41:07 - 41:12)
crime ramp but that's the final reward (41:09 - 41:12)
i mean they're both water (41:13 - 41:16)
i think it's because they're both like (41:15 - 41:19)
derpy cowboy outfits oh (41:16 - 41:22)
yeah uh the brilliant diamond shining (41:19 - 41:25)
pearl was the shortest i timed this it (41:22 - 41:26)
was the shortest news out of all the (41:25 - 41:28)
news we just covered (41:26 - 41:32)
uh which is funny because i think (41:28 - 41:35)
wait a minute shorter than the pokemon (41:32 - 41:36)
go (41:35 - 41:37)
it was definitely shorter than the (41:36 - 41:40)
pokemon go really (41:37 - 41:42)
because the pokemon go had the executor (41:40 - 41:44)
part that they added on (41:42 - 41:47)
i mean i'll take your word for it (41:44 - 41:49)
they were both they were both like a (41:47 - 41:50)
minute (41:49 - 41:52)
uh all together (41:50 - 41:53)
uh but (41:52 - 41:54)
the the the (41:53 - 41:56)
brilliant diamond shining pearl you (41:54 - 41:58)
would think like oh here comes gw here (41:56 - 41:59)
comes the gws (41:58 - 42:01)
maybe they're fixing this (41:59 - 42:05)
here comes the home support (42:01 - 42:05)
just shaman just uh which is like (42:05 - 42:12)
it's even hard to be excited for shaman (42:09 - 42:14)
because you if you bought (42:12 - 42:18)
diamond and pearl you get the shaymin in (42:14 - 42:19)
legends (42:18 - 42:21)
yeah if you can't move it to diamond (42:19 - 42:25)
pearl like can you that's true mm-hmm (42:21 - 42:27)
there's two ways maybe it's somebody's (42:25 - 42:28)
favorite (42:27 - 42:30)
mythical maybe it's like shaymin day (42:28 - 42:32)
starting february 27th trainers can (42:30 - 42:36)
receive oak's letter by choosing get via (42:32 - 42:38)
internet in the mystery gift once (42:36 - 42:39)
trainers get oak's letter they can talk (42:38 - 42:42)
to the first professor oak on route 224 (42:39 - 42:45)
uh he will ask for cooperation in (42:42 - 42:47)
regarding a stone tablet found in the (42:45 - 42:50)
kanto region it's always kanto uh (42:47 - 42:51)
trainers will assist professor oak the (42:50 - 42:53)
mythical pokemon shaymin will appear (42:51 - 42:55)
trainers can follow it and try to add it (42:53 - 42:57)
to their team shaman is the gratitude (42:55 - 42:59)
pokemon and it is able to change in the (42:57 - 43:02)
sky form using the uh gracidia item (42:59 - 43:04)
so that's that's it that's literally all (43:02 - 43:06)
they announced for this game yep (43:04 - 43:07)
just not that this is going to matter (43:06 - 43:09)
for the podcast but i i didn't know it's (43:07 - 43:11)
like in the press release they say (43:09 - 43:13)
february 27th on the website they say (43:11 - 43:16)
starting monday february 28th (43:13 - 43:19)
i'm assuming the 27th is correct i mean (43:16 - 43:21)
i've already gotten the oaks letter so (43:19 - 43:25)
yeah i just know why the website's wrong (43:21 - 43:31)
um maybe it's worldwide is the 28th (43:25 - 43:33)
in case there are places on the wrong (43:31 - 43:35)
side of the international date line (43:33 - 43:37)
where maybe the 20th year it depends on (43:35 - 43:39)
the future (43:37 - 43:41)
i i saw that you could only get this i (43:39 - 43:43)
don't think they say it here (43:41 - 43:45)
man where did i see that i don't want to (43:43 - 43:47)
misspeak but i i saw there was an end i (43:45 - 43:48)
thought there was an end date for (43:47 - 43:51)
shaymin like you can't get it forever is (43:48 - 43:53)
that going to be available until sunday (43:51 - 43:55)
march 27th (43:53 - 43:56)
at (43:55 - 43:58)
7 59 a.m oh so they're only giving you (43:56 - 44:00)
like a month to get shaymin yeah it's a (43:58 - 44:02)
month well to get the ticket like once (44:00 - 44:04)
you get the ticket you can visit anytime (44:02 - 44:06)
yeah yeah you have a month to get the (44:04 - 44:07)
ticket (44:06 - 44:09)
according to the website which already (44:07 - 44:12)
has bad dates so get it well before the (44:09 - 44:17)
27th of march they did do a uh update (44:12 - 44:18)
late last week (44:17 - 44:20)
uh they said they fixed bugs they (44:18 - 44:22)
increased the union room from two people (44:20 - 44:25)
to eight people (44:22 - 44:26)
who (44:25 - 44:28)
are eight people even playing this game (44:26 - 44:30)
anymore like what what i'm sure there (44:28 - 44:31)
are eight people in the world still (44:30 - 44:33)
playing this game (44:31 - 44:35)
[Music] (44:33 - 44:37)
doing in the union room (44:35 - 44:39)
hanging out (44:37 - 44:42)
union chatting swiping right (44:39 - 44:46)
battles trades (44:42 - 44:46)
um and then finally (44:49 - 44:54)
uh (44:53 - 44:57)
that brings us to legends although (44:54 - 44:59)
i think this is a good spot for a break (44:57 - 45:01)
we'll come back we'll talk about legends (44:59 - 45:03)
and then we'll talk about (45:01 - 45:06)
uh gen 9 here (45:03 - 45:08)
so (45:06 - 45:10)
let's take a break the legend stuff (45:08 - 45:12)
seems (45:10 - 45:12)
it seems like they went through it so (45:14 - 45:19)
fast and they seemed to like it was like (45:16 - 45:21)
a light free update when when they were (45:19 - 45:24)
did it like 1.1 i was like oh that (45:21 - 45:26)
doesn't seem that big but it seems like (45:24 - 45:27)
it's a lot of stuff (45:26 - 45:28)
yeah (45:27 - 45:29)
but (45:28 - 45:30)
i don't know we'll talk about it when we (45:29 - 45:33)
get back we'll take a quick break (45:30 - 45:37)
and we are back from our break uh so (45:33 - 45:39)
we'll do legends and then we'll do gen 9 (45:37 - 45:41)
here although i don't want to spend a (45:39 - 45:43)
whole lot of time on legends not because (45:41 - 45:45)
it doesn't seem big or huge or i don't (45:43 - 45:47)
know (45:45 - 45:49)
they added stuff i just i think it's (45:47 - 45:50)
easier to talk about legends next week (45:49 - 45:53)
when we play it i i because it just (45:50 - 45:54)
dropped this morning i don't think any (45:53 - 45:56)
of us have had a chance to really like (45:54 - 45:58)
look firsthand of what's new here i'll (45:56 - 46:00)
just read from the press release uh so (45:58 - 46:03)
daybreak is a software update it's (46:00 - 46:06)
version 1.1.0 (46:03 - 46:08)
uh it will be starting available today (46:06 - 46:11)
february 27th in the day break update (46:08 - 46:12)
trainers will begin (46:11 - 46:14)
investigating mysterious mass outbreaks (46:12 - 46:16)
of pokemon that are popping all over up (46:14 - 46:18)
all over the history region players will (46:16 - 46:19)
also have a chance to battle for (46:18 - 46:21)
powerful opponents like legendary (46:19 - 46:23)
pokemon and wardens adding yet more (46:21 - 46:26)
options to the battle experience (46:23 - 46:26)
that that's what the press really says (46:28 - 46:31)
okay there's like four things they do (46:29 - 46:34)
they added like um more customization to (46:31 - 46:37)
the photo studio as well for (46:34 - 46:39)
anyone who cares about that somebody (46:37 - 46:41)
does i'm sure did they add new (46:39 - 46:43)
haircuts because i don't think with this (46:41 - 46:45)
picture the (46:43 - 46:47)
the haircut people (46:45 - 46:51)
in in the video (46:47 - 46:51)
i don't (46:51 - 46:53)
think (46:52 - 46:55)
anywhere in what i've read was new (46:53 - 46:57)
haircuts added (46:55 - 46:58)
yeah i mean (46:57 - 47:00)
i know you're talking they appeared but (46:58 - 47:03)
not they they appeared in a way that (47:00 - 47:04)
made them look like they were concerned (47:03 - 47:06)
about what's happening in the world not (47:04 - 47:10)
like oh and i have new hairstyles (47:06 - 47:10)
so my complaint before we get into this (47:11 - 47:15)
is about friends who start talking about (47:13 - 47:17)
endgame content for a game that you (47:15 - 47:19)
clearly haven't gotten to the end game (47:17 - 47:21)
when you go out to lunch with them (47:19 - 47:24)
you just went away to the bathroom you (47:21 - 47:25)
closed the door (47:24 - 47:27)
came back from the bathroom and all of a (47:25 - 47:28)
sudden they're talking about their (47:27 - 47:31)
opinions of things you haven't seen yet (47:28 - 47:33)
i thought you said you hated legends and (47:31 - 47:36)
you weren't going to finish it (47:33 - 47:36)
i'm hearing excuses not answers (47:36 - 47:40)
i don't remember look i don't remember (47:41 - 47:44)
this part (47:43 - 47:46)
what i what i do remember (47:44 - 47:48)
[Laughter] (47:46 - 47:51)
is the master trainer battles from let's (47:48 - 47:53)
go that's what i remember (47:51 - 47:55)
and so it sounds like the battling part (47:53 - 47:56)
here (47:55 - 47:59)
is exactly what (47:56 - 48:00)
uh (47:59 - 48:01)
people are saying (48:00 - 48:03)
ingo (48:01 - 48:05)
will (48:03 - 48:07)
show up he'll say i want to battle your (48:05 - 48:09)
uh your sneezeler i'm using a sneezer (48:07 - 48:11)
you're using a sneezeler and then if you (48:09 - 48:12)
win you get like a little check mark on (48:11 - 48:14)
your pokedex (48:12 - 48:17)
like like job well done (48:14 - 48:18)
and you can do that with all (48:17 - 48:21)
242 pokemon (48:18 - 48:22)
and (48:21 - 48:23)
if you didn't play let's go pikachu (48:22 - 48:25)
let's go eevee (48:23 - 48:27)
this was something they talked about (48:25 - 48:28)
they were like hey do you want to be the (48:27 - 48:31)
metapod master metapod versus metapod (48:28 - 48:34)
and everyone was like oh that's so funny (48:31 - 48:36)
uh throwback to the anime of course i (48:34 - 48:37)
want to do that and then you do it and (48:36 - 48:39)
you realize it's the most boring dumb (48:37 - 48:40)
thing in the entire world and you're (48:39 - 48:42)
like i can't believe i wasted 25 minutes (48:40 - 48:45)
doing this to be the metapod master (48:42 - 48:46)
which (48:45 - 48:48)
doesn't actually matter whatever if you (48:46 - 48:49)
wanted to collect all the titles you (48:48 - 48:51)
could there's a lot of things that don't (48:49 - 48:54)
matter in pokemon i understand uh (48:51 - 48:56)
but man as somebody who wanted to be a (48:54 - 48:58)
completionist and let's go pikachu let's (48:56 - 49:00)
go evie i love that game by the way i i (48:58 - 49:01)
say it all the time i think let's go (49:00 - 49:02)
pikachu let's go eevee are fantastic (49:01 - 49:04)
games for what they are they're they're (49:02 - 49:06)
relatively short and small compared to (49:04 - 49:08)
other pokemon games but because they're (49:06 - 49:10)
relatively short and small i was like (49:08 - 49:12)
why not do the master trainer battles it (49:10 - 49:18)
seems fun i did about 70 of the 150 (49:12 - 49:21)
and and it stopped being fun (49:18 - 49:23)
there's just (49:21 - 49:23)
they're just not great they're okay (49:23 - 49:28)
toxic protect (49:26 - 49:31)
toxic protect or like (49:28 - 49:34)
i am toxic protecting right now against (49:31 - 49:37)
will's toxicity so i i just (49:34 - 49:39)
i don't (49:37 - 49:41)
love (49:39 - 49:42)
here's here's greg and i were talking (49:41 - 49:45)
about this uh the other day (49:42 - 49:48)
i can appreciate what they are going for (49:45 - 49:51)
in a battle sense in legends (49:48 - 49:54)
where it kind of reminds me of an (49:51 - 49:55)
episode of the anime (49:54 - 49:57)
where like one (49:55 - 50:00)
fast pokemon might attack pikachu like (49:57 - 50:03)
three times and then pikachu survives (50:00 - 50:05)
and then pikachu just does like one big (50:03 - 50:08)
thunderbolt and that pokemon dies (50:05 - 50:11)
it it does give me like anime vibes (50:08 - 50:15)
in that sense and it feels like all of (50:11 - 50:16)
the battles (50:15 - 50:18)
i know will brought up post game stuff (50:16 - 50:19)
and i don't want to spoil the post game (50:18 - 50:20)
person (50:19 - 50:22)
but there's a person in the post game (50:20 - 50:24)
where you have to fight them (50:22 - 50:26)
and it's probably one of the more (50:24 - 50:27)
cohesive (50:26 - 50:31)
fights like it kind of feels good (50:27 - 50:33)
but that's also because he it's not like (50:31 - 50:35)
when you fight ira done she's like i (50:33 - 50:37)
don't know here's like three evs pick (50:35 - 50:38)
which one you want to fight it's like (50:37 - 50:41)
this isn't fair but it's also like (50:38 - 50:43)
yeah i'm going to win but like this also (50:41 - 50:45)
isn't fun to like talk like (50:43 - 50:46)
it's just like silly (50:45 - 50:47)
um (50:46 - 50:49)
but the thing with that like final fight (50:47 - 50:51)
and i think why most of the fights feel (50:49 - 50:52)
a little weird in that game is it you're (50:51 - 50:55)
just shotting back and forth (50:52 - 50:57)
they'll send out a pokemon it'll one (50:55 - 50:59)
shot you because either it goes twice i (50:57 - 51:01)
guess that's technically not a one shot (50:59 - 51:03)
but ultimately like that's the (51:01 - 51:05)
definition of not a one shot sure but (51:03 - 51:06)
like (51:05 - 51:08)
they go twice before you even write so (51:06 - 51:10)
they like half health half health you're (51:08 - 51:11)
dead and then of course if you know type (51:10 - 51:13)
weaknesses you're gonna send out the (51:11 - 51:15)
thing that one shots it and then they're (51:13 - 51:17)
gonna send the thing that one shots you (51:15 - 51:19)
there's not a whole lot of options and (51:17 - 51:21)
because legends removed protect they (51:19 - 51:23)
removed a lot of like straight-up status (51:21 - 51:25)
moves like will i don't think there's (51:23 - 51:26)
willowists (51:25 - 51:27)
there might be willowists (51:26 - 51:29)
i know you can burn (51:27 - 51:31)
um i don't know that willow i've not (51:29 - 51:33)
seen willow wisp on anything (51:31 - 51:35)
doesn't mean it doesn't exist i just (51:33 - 51:37)
haven't seen it but you can't like (51:35 - 51:39)
swords dance three times in a row (51:37 - 51:41)
correct you can't harden six times in a (51:39 - 51:43)
row which i'm all for (51:41 - 51:46)
so they got rid of both you stalling and (51:43 - 51:48)
the computer start stalling which i can (51:46 - 51:50)
appreciate in a sense of these battles (51:48 - 51:52)
feel faster but there's also points in (51:50 - 51:53)
the battle where you just accept that (51:52 - 51:54)
like (51:53 - 51:57)
oh he's going to die (51:54 - 51:59)
and like if i if if i switch out to the (51:57 - 52:00)
pokemon that is stronger (51:59 - 52:02)
i'm just going to put myself at a (52:00 - 52:04)
disadvantage because they're going to go (52:02 - 52:05)
probably twice (52:04 - 52:07)
so you're like oh this rose rate is (52:05 - 52:08)
going to knock out my weasel (52:07 - 52:11)
that whatever that's fine like like i (52:08 - 52:13)
will bring in my fire pokemon next to (52:11 - 52:14)
knock out the rose right and they will (52:13 - 52:16)
probably bring in a water pokemon to (52:14 - 52:17)
knock out my fire pokemon i'm gonna (52:16 - 52:19)
bring in my grass like that's just (52:17 - 52:21)
how the battle system (52:19 - 52:23)
now that like you've done like the 20 (52:21 - 52:25)
battles in the game it's like okay i get (52:23 - 52:27)
what you were going for yeah and it's (52:25 - 52:29)
hard to show that early on when you're (52:27 - 52:31)
only fighting a trainer that has one (52:29 - 52:34)
pokemon or two pokemon but because one (52:31 - 52:35)
of the people at the end of the game has (52:34 - 52:37)
a full party (52:35 - 52:40)
it feels a little bit better (52:37 - 52:44)
uh i mean again as i said before (52:40 - 52:46)
it feels like they wanted to mimic (52:44 - 52:47)
something but they weren't too timid (52:46 - 52:49)
with it like (52:47 - 52:51)
it would have been nice if (52:49 - 52:53)
they had included like (52:51 - 52:55)
the pokemon go ray thing where you can (52:53 - 52:58)
swipe and your pokemon moves and dodges (52:55 - 53:00)
if they wanted to make it more anime (52:58 - 53:01)
feel (53:00 - 53:02)
in (53:01 - 53:03)
in that way it would have been nice if (53:02 - 53:05)
they were for agile style if you also (53:03 - 53:08)
had at that point not controlled to do a (53:05 - 53:10)
move but you could try to dodge out of (53:08 - 53:12)
the way like you could hit y for your (53:10 - 53:15)
pokemon to roll at the right time like (53:12 - 53:18)
you do with bosses like (53:15 - 53:21)
they just they didn't take it far enough (53:18 - 53:23)
to mimic one or the other and so it's (53:21 - 53:26)
kind of this muddy middle ground that (53:23 - 53:29)
at times can feel satisfying but at (53:26 - 53:31)
other times can feel real unsatisfying (53:29 - 53:33)
it's a real inconsistent experience i (53:31 - 53:34)
think (53:33 - 53:36)
yeah um and the thing that i had (53:34 - 53:40)
problems with was (53:36 - 53:43)
i i don't (53:40 - 53:45)
i (53:43 - 53:47)
obviously i stream on twitch i think (53:45 - 53:48)
everyone knows that by now if you're (53:47 - 53:49)
listening to the podcast i stream like (53:48 - 53:52)
40 hours a week on twitch and (53:49 - 53:54)
i would say (53:52 - 53:56)
and there there's always people that are (53:54 - 53:57)
like backseating there's always people (53:56 - 53:59)
that are like oh you'll be you won't be (53:57 - 54:01)
able to do this without grit or i can't (53:59 - 54:02)
wait till you get to this part because i (54:01 - 54:05)
really struggled with it (54:02 - 54:06)
and (54:05 - 54:08)
like a lot of those parts were the the (54:06 - 54:11)
two trainers before the the final (54:08 - 54:13)
credits there's two trainers that pop up (54:11 - 54:14)
and (54:13 - 54:17)
i've used no grit in this game i've used (54:14 - 54:19)
no mints i've i don't even think i (54:17 - 54:21)
changed any of my move sets i was just (54:19 - 54:22)
like (54:21 - 54:23)
whatever i'm just gonna click the button (54:22 - 54:25)
that says super effective (54:23 - 54:26)
that's it (54:25 - 54:28)
and i didn't have i didn't have trouble (54:26 - 54:30)
with those two trainers (54:28 - 54:32)
and when i was approaching the one of (54:30 - 54:35)
the final guys to battle (54:32 - 54:38)
i purposely went back to my pc to get (54:35 - 54:41)
like a glamio and a weasel and like some (54:38 - 54:42)
other garbage pokemon because my thought (54:41 - 54:45)
process was (54:42 - 54:45)
if i use grit before this battle (54:45 - 54:51)
i am going to be told (54:48 - 54:54)
well you only won because you used grit (54:51 - 54:56)
which is like (54:54 - 54:58)
it's in the game for that i know i know (54:56 - 55:00)
that's perfectly fair use the tools that (54:58 - 55:03)
they gave you to beat the battle don't (55:00 - 55:05)
use the tools that they gave you you (55:03 - 55:07)
only beat me up because both of your (55:05 - 55:09)
arms were free if you tied both of your (55:07 - 55:11)
hands behind your back you couldn't get (55:09 - 55:14)
me well no kidding so the entire time (55:11 - 55:16)
i'm playing this game and this is this (55:14 - 55:17)
is a problem with me specifically on (55:16 - 55:19)
twitch is you know you have people that (55:17 - 55:22)
that are are upset that they struggled (55:19 - 55:23)
with the game or that you're (55:22 - 55:25)
experiencing the game easier than they (55:23 - 55:28)
did or what not so i was like you know (55:25 - 55:29)
what would be really fun (55:28 - 55:32)
can i beat this this dude with a glam (55:29 - 55:34)
meow with a weasel with like because (55:32 - 55:36)
these were the pokemon i used throughout (55:34 - 55:38)
the entire game it's not like i i (55:36 - 55:40)
grabbed shaymin or darkrai or or (55:38 - 55:42)
landorus or anything right like these (55:40 - 55:44)
are these are just the pokemon i caught (55:42 - 55:46)
and i decided to use (55:44 - 55:47)
and (55:46 - 55:49)
i went in and i almost beat him and i (55:47 - 55:51)
was like oh that was fun and then they (55:49 - 55:53)
start you right in front of him again (55:51 - 55:54)
and i was like i think i could beat him (55:53 - 55:56)
this time and then i did (55:54 - 55:58)
there's like a little twist that happens (55:56 - 56:00)
and okay i got to start over um and at (55:58 - 56:02)
that point i went back and i got like my (56:00 - 56:04)
normal team like i put the glam meow (56:02 - 56:06)
away and i went through and i had zero (56:04 - 56:08)
problems doing it (56:06 - 56:09)
and (56:08 - 56:11)
i kind of wish that i could have a safe (56:09 - 56:13)
state in front of that dude because i'd (56:11 - 56:14)
be curious to be like (56:13 - 56:16)
can i actually do this with a glamio i (56:14 - 56:18)
think i could but (56:16 - 56:20)
um (56:18 - 56:20)
but that was like a fun experience for (56:21 - 56:25)
me but i didn't again i didn't find it (56:23 - 56:27)
particularly hard because (56:25 - 56:29)
there's only so much you can do in these (56:27 - 56:31)
battles like you don't really have like (56:29 - 56:33)
maybe you you could sword stance at the (56:31 - 56:35)
right position like i die or hit with (56:33 - 56:37)
weasel at the right position (56:35 - 56:40)
but it is it is pretty much a slugfest (56:37 - 56:42)
it is i'm knocking at you you're (56:40 - 56:43)
knocking at me i'm not and i think (56:42 - 56:45)
that's why some people probably really (56:43 - 56:47)
like the battle system because it does (56:45 - 56:50)
make it go way faster like at the end of (56:47 - 56:52)
the day like is it really hard that (56:50 - 56:54)
five of your six pokemon died if you win (56:52 - 56:56)
no like like who cares if their water (56:54 - 56:58)
pokemon's gonna knock out my fire i'm (56:56 - 56:59)
just gonna bring my next pokemon and (56:58 - 57:00)
knock them out like it's like it's a (56:59 - 57:02)
complete slugfest (57:00 - 57:04)
um (57:02 - 57:04)
but man when they're like hey you can (57:04 - 57:10)
battle ingo 250 242 different times with (57:06 - 57:13)
the same pokemon this is just let's go (57:10 - 57:14)
and i don't (57:13 - 57:16)
like i guess you get rid of the protect (57:14 - 57:18)
stall but (57:16 - 57:20)
like it now makes sense why mints are in (57:18 - 57:21)
the game (57:20 - 57:24)
yeah and it makes like and the the grit (57:21 - 57:26)
stuff is similar to the candy stuff in (57:24 - 57:29)
let's go and now that all makes sense (57:26 - 57:31)
yep (57:29 - 57:31)
which is like totally (57:31 - 57:36)
fine comes out with version 1.2 now that (57:33 - 57:38)
we've seen that they can do a 1.1 that (57:36 - 57:41)
has additional content that (57:38 - 57:43)
with a name (57:41 - 57:46)
yeah you know we may see a 1.2 with a (57:43 - 57:49)
name yeah i think like i even think the (57:46 - 57:51)
website gives up more information about (57:49 - 57:53)
what's happening than the than they said (57:51 - 57:55)
in the direct sure yeah i have the (57:53 - 57:56)
website up here (57:55 - 57:58)
um (57:56 - 58:00)
massive mass outbreaks which they didn't (57:58 - 58:04)
name in the in the direct (58:00 - 58:04)
yeah it seems like the shiny odds are (58:06 - 58:09)
different from massive mass outbreaks it (58:07 - 58:12)
seems like it's harder to get chinese um (58:09 - 58:14)
in that situation (58:12 - 58:16)
it says you'll be able to go to sleep in (58:14 - 58:17)
your house and then you'll be able to do (58:16 - 58:20)
a challenge of strength against (58:17 - 58:22)
multiple legendary pokemon at once which (58:20 - 58:25)
they didn't they didn't even mention the (58:22 - 58:26)
whole go to sleep in your house like (58:25 - 58:28)
they showed a little bit of it but i'm (58:26 - 58:29)
like oh (58:28 - 58:31)
you go to sleep in your house and you (58:29 - 58:32)
get (58:31 - 58:35)
you go to the dream world (58:32 - 58:35)
yeah (58:35 - 58:38)
so you have you have the go to sleep and (58:35 - 58:40)
battle legendaries you have the go to (58:38 - 58:43)
the courtyard and battle ingo you have (58:40 - 58:46)
the update to the photo studio and then (58:43 - 58:48)
which is the most important thing and (58:46 - 58:50)
then you have the new mass outbreak (58:48 - 58:51)
system so those are the four things they (58:50 - 58:53)
introduced in this free update (58:51 - 58:54)
if you think (58:53 - 58:57)
i am not the minute this podcast is over (58:54 - 59:00)
going to that photo studio and taking a (58:57 - 59:02)
million pictures with my boyfriend (59:00 - 59:05)
you are sadly mistaken that is all i'm (59:02 - 59:07)
going to do (59:05 - 59:07)
you sure (59:10 - 59:13)
and then there's the free gift of the 30 (59:18 - 59:23)
ultra balls 30 gigaton balls 30 jetballs (59:20 - 59:25)
that they did that as well what's the (59:23 - 59:26)
code (59:25 - 59:29)
adventure arceus adventure so we'll talk (59:26 - 59:31)
about the mass outbreak stuff more next (59:29 - 59:33)
week yeah uh (59:31 - 59:35)
i i i don't know (59:33 - 59:37)
i think some people were maybe (59:35 - 59:39)
expecting myself included that there (59:37 - 59:42)
would be like a 20 dlc and it would be (59:39 - 59:44)
100 more pokemon and maybe like another (59:42 - 59:47)
area you could travel to that's still (59:44 - 59:49)
possible it's not possible (59:47 - 59:51)
it's just nice like snap we get (59:49 - 59:54)
a free dlc that adds some stuff it's (59:51 - 59:55)
cool (59:54 - 59:56)
yeah well that's a good because i was (59:55 - 59:58)
gonna actually compare it to snap (59:56 - 60:00)
because i think (59:58 - 60:02)
i think they both have the same timeline (60:00 - 60:04)
like you're either you're either that (60:02 - 60:05)
person that has gotten to the end of the (60:04 - 60:07)
game it was like i am satisfied with (60:05 - 60:10)
this i am moving on to the next game (60:07 - 60:12)
they announced dlc i'm coming back for a (60:10 - 60:14)
day or two cool i am now going back to (60:12 - 60:16)
my other game or you are (60:14 - 60:18)
i am going to grind out everything in (60:16 - 60:20)
this i want the whole pokedex i want (60:18 - 60:22)
level 10s i want perfect i want to be (60:20 - 60:25)
that's how you can get arceus man (60:22 - 60:26)
um (60:25 - 60:28)
so i think that's nice i think that's (60:26 - 60:29)
nice to the people who do want to grind (60:28 - 60:31)
it out and i think it's nice that it (60:29 - 60:32)
maybe brings people that were maybe done (60:31 - 60:34)
with the game back to the game for (60:32 - 60:36)
another day or two but (60:34 - 60:38)
as cool as it is to see a bunch of (60:36 - 60:41)
alphas and mass outbreaks (60:38 - 60:41)
how like if you already walked away from (60:41 - 60:44)
the game i don't know how attention (60:43 - 60:47)
grabby that is (60:44 - 60:47)
it might be nice for like an evening but (60:47 - 60:51)
okay (60:53 - 60:58)

violet you will be able to link it to (63:15 - 63:19)
pokemon home (63:17 - 63:20)
a surface that trainers can keep their (63:19 - 63:22)
entire pokemon collection in one place i (63:20 - 63:23)
just wanna get that out there that (63:22 - 63:25)
pokemon home is compatible with this (63:23 - 63:27)
game it is also compatible with (63:25 - 63:30)
bdsp and legends maybe one day and maybe (63:27 - 63:32)
by the time this game comes out they'll (63:30 - 63:34)
be compatible who knows (63:32 - 63:36)
um (63:34 - 63:36)
i wanna i just wanna start with the with (63:39 - 63:45)
us the words open world this was (63:40 - 63:47)
this was they (63:45 - 63:48)
i said this (63:47 - 63:50)
on many podcasts (63:48 - 63:52)
i will continue this will the reason (63:50 - 63:53)
we're saying this again is because it (63:52 - 63:55)
will apply to the future you can use (63:53 - 63:57)
this knowledge in the future (63:55 - 64:00)
if your video game doesn't matter if (63:57 - 64:02)
it's pokemon doesn't matter if it's on (64:00 - 64:05)
ps5 xbox 360 (64:02 - 64:08)
the nintendo wii u whatever (64:05 - 64:09)
if your video game is an open world (64:08 - 64:11)
video game (64:09 - 64:13)
you better believe (64:11 - 64:17)
that company is going to let you know (64:13 - 64:18)
time and time again that that game is (64:17 - 64:20)
open world (64:18 - 64:22)
they will scream it from (64:20 - 64:25)
shore to shore they will they will as if (64:22 - 64:28)
you're maria on the mountain (64:25 - 64:31)
the hills are alive with the open world (64:28 - 64:34)
they never said that for legends (64:31 - 64:36)
no and it's not (64:34 - 64:38)
you know a seamless (64:36 - 64:41)
walk from jubalife into the wilderness (64:38 - 64:43)
area game now does that matter does that (64:41 - 64:45)
suddenly make a game better no i don't (64:43 - 64:47)
think so i think legends is great i (64:45 - 64:49)
don't the load screen between juba life (64:47 - 64:52)
to the field lens doesn't bother me at (64:49 - 64:53)
all (64:52 - 64:55)
i still like i still like that game (64:53 - 64:56)
um (64:55 - 64:59)
i think the open worldness that is the (64:56 - 65:01)
the isle of armor and the crown tundra i (64:59 - 65:04)
think those are great like cool (65:01 - 65:05)
um (65:04 - 65:07)
if for whatever reason there's not a (65:05 - 65:08)
black loading screen between the isle of (65:07 - 65:10)
armor and the dojo (65:08 - 65:13)
great i guess i saved like three seconds (65:10 - 65:15)
or two seconds whatever that is (65:13 - 65:16)
that that in itself is not a deal (65:15 - 65:18)
breaker like i'm just (65:16 - 65:20)
they purposely did not use the words (65:18 - 65:23)
open world for legends (65:20 - 65:25)
i don't know if that was marketing that (65:23 - 65:27)
was the set expectations that was to (65:25 - 65:29)
save that term (65:27 - 65:32)
for this game because it they i feel (65:29 - 65:34)
like they could only do that once right (65:32 - 65:37)
like this is our full open world game (65:34 - 65:39)
and we want to attach that powerful (65:37 - 65:42)
phrase to this game and make that a big (65:39 - 65:44)
deal (65:42 - 65:46)
um i think that's ultimately like what (65:44 - 65:47)
they're doing here like we don't want to (65:46 - 65:48)
waste (65:47 - 65:51)
our open world marketing on legends even (65:48 - 65:53)
though they kind of got that for free (65:51 - 65:54)
um (65:53 - 65:57)
but this is their first true (65:54 - 65:58)
and we don't even i don't even know what (65:57 - 66:00)
that means does that mean like you can (65:58 - 66:02)
walk to all eight gyms or ten gyms but (66:00 - 66:03)
you can't actually battle because (66:02 - 66:04)
there's a dude standing in front and (66:03 - 66:05)
he's like oh you gotta get three more (66:04 - 66:07)
badges before you get in here but like (66:05 - 66:09)
we don't know could be and it also says (66:07 - 66:11)
you know you have to be very careful to (66:09 - 66:12)
particular words (66:11 - 66:16)
various towns blend seamlessly into the (66:12 - 66:17)
wilderness not (66:16 - 66:20)
all towns blend seamlessly (66:17 - 66:24)
right so it's that's more of a like (66:20 - 66:28)
we're gonna have open world around this (66:24 - 66:30)
and then it's a little more constricted (66:28 - 66:32)
over here and then open world around (66:30 - 66:33)
this (66:32 - 66:36)
part like that yeah (66:33 - 66:37)
well i also have of him that could also (66:36 - 66:39)
be that (66:37 - 66:41)
towns are not you can go anywhere there (66:39 - 66:44)
are going to be invisible barriers yeah (66:41 - 66:47)
all over the place and towns so you uh (66:44 - 66:48)
you had a bit of a misread it's you'll (66:47 - 66:51)
be able to see the pokemon of this (66:48 - 66:53)
region in the skies in the seas in the (66:51 - 66:54)
forest (66:53 - 66:56)
not the trainers (66:54 - 66:59)
sky battles are returning what (66:56 - 67:02)
finally (66:59 - 67:02)
um the reveal the way they did it was (67:03 - 67:08)
really great (67:06 - 67:10)
i liked the you know (67:08 - 67:13)
somebody broke into this room and the (67:10 - 67:16)
the officer had to check it it it seemed (67:13 - 67:18)
very (67:16 - 67:21)
i don't think that was somebody broke (67:18 - 67:24)
into this room into this room (67:21 - 67:27)
that was a there's a there is somebody (67:24 - 67:31)
in here causing a a loud ruckus yeah you (67:27 - 67:34)
go investigate right (67:31 - 67:35)
it didn't give (67:34 - 67:38)
it did give to me it gave detective (67:35 - 67:40)
pikachu vibes off the bat 100 (67:38 - 67:42)
agreed yeah okay because i was like the (67:40 - 67:43)
first thing that i said they're (67:42 - 67:47)
announcing detective pikachu too (67:43 - 67:49)
because i thought what's causing the (67:47 - 67:51)
ruckus it's probably pikachu yeah and (67:49 - 67:53)
then they went to a shaking cup of (67:51 - 67:56)
coffee and i was like man that pikachu (67:53 - 67:59)
really liked coffee the minute the (67:56 - 68:01)
minute it went to (67:59 - 68:04)
a video of somebody walking around a (68:01 - 68:07)
building i'm like oh it's gen nine (68:04 - 68:09)
the minute i saw him going up that (68:07 - 68:11)
escalator i'm like there is no other (68:09 - 68:13)
option but gen 9. (68:11 - 68:15)
did you play detective pikachu all the (68:13 - 68:17)
way to the end yeah (68:15 - 68:19)
interesting (68:17 - 68:21)
yeah that game ends weird (68:19 - 68:22)
well no i was just thinking because it's (68:21 - 68:25)
like to me like not only the coffee and (68:22 - 68:27)
the whole it's like oh we saw something (68:25 - 68:29)
dart down the hall into this room (68:27 - 68:32)
but it's like it's a room full of stuff (68:29 - 68:34)
so you know you're gonna have a screen (68:32 - 68:36)
and you're gonna have to look for clues (68:34 - 68:38)
like in this room full of stuff that's (68:36 - 68:40)
so yeah i got this (68:38 - 68:42)
i don't i don't know if that was like (68:40 - 68:44)
what what really threw me off is when it (68:42 - 68:46)
said game freak because game freak's not (68:44 - 68:48)
making detective pikachu like creatures (68:46 - 68:50)
is making detective people yeah (68:48 - 68:53)
i mean it was so cl like (68:50 - 68:56)
and as just be we did this on the the (68:53 - 68:58)
twitch stream so if you came and watched (68:56 - 68:59)
the twitch stream with us (68:58 - 69:01)
um thank you that was like cool to have (68:59 - 69:02)
everyone there and if you missed it (69:01 - 69:05)
that's on youtube but (69:02 - 69:08)
um somebody pointed out that like no (69:05 - 69:10)
detective pikachu's not canceled they're (69:08 - 69:12)
literally hiring people to like finish (69:10 - 69:14)
and work on it like as of like february (69:12 - 69:15)
2nd (69:14 - 69:17)
so it's not (69:15 - 69:18)
suddenly (69:17 - 69:20)
who knows i don't i don't know why that (69:18 - 69:21)
game's taking so long (69:20 - 69:22)
maybe when they announced it they didn't (69:21 - 69:24)
even start it like they were just like (69:22 - 69:26)
hey (69:24 - 69:27)
we announced it but who knows what (69:26 - 69:29)
happened like it's hard to say (69:27 - 69:30)
given (69:29 - 69:32)
everything in the world i mean i feel (69:30 - 69:35)
like that ship kind of sailed honestly (69:32 - 69:36)
unless they're (69:35 - 69:38)
waiting for like a (69:36 - 69:41)
like a animated series or a tv series or (69:38 - 69:42)
they're planning on pairing this and (69:41 - 69:44)
they're waiting on something else do you (69:42 - 69:45)
mean that they've waited too long for it (69:44 - 69:48)
to come out i feel like they did yeah i (69:45 - 69:50)
feel like it's been so long detective (69:48 - 69:53)
pikachu two drops or three in japan (69:50 - 69:54)
because the first one was split into two (69:53 - 69:56)
games or whatever i'm i'm in i'm i'm (69:54 - 69:58)
playing i mean i'm still in too i'm (69:56 - 70:00)
still i really enjoyed that that game (69:58 - 70:03)
yeah i don't i don't think (70:00 - 70:06)
there's a real true time limit on (70:03 - 70:08)
pokemon fans in a pokemon game because i (70:06 - 70:10)
don't think there's a ton of outside (70:08 - 70:11)
people are like (70:10 - 70:12)
let's get (70:11 - 70:14)
let's get detective pikachu i don't (70:12 - 70:17)
think it's like (70:14 - 70:17)
a big (70:18 - 70:22)
outside the pokemon world draw (70:19 - 70:25)
and they could also very well (70:22 - 70:27)
be timing it with a (70:25 - 70:29)
when a movie comes out (70:27 - 70:31)
yeah and like it's i didn't think the (70:29 - 70:34)
movie got picked up again though oh wow (70:31 - 70:36)
but i think he's got a lot of money he (70:34 - 70:38)
owns a lot of companies (70:36 - 70:40)
he can do whatever he wants (70:38 - 70:42)
daddy i mean i don't i don't think there (70:40 - 70:44)
needs to be like every movie always like (70:42 - 70:46)
secures a sequel just in case (70:44 - 70:48)
i don't think there needs to be a sequel (70:46 - 70:50)
to detective pikachu but (70:48 - 70:52)
they could easily do like an animated (70:50 - 70:54)
series or like a youtube thing or or (70:52 - 70:56)
they oh we didn't even talk about this (70:54 - 70:58)
they they were doing a short youtube (70:56 - 70:59)
thing for (70:58 - 71:02)
legends yeah yeah i'm excited for that (70:59 - 71:04)
uh for the jesui region (71:02 - 71:06)
um (71:04 - 71:08)
so yeah this is the uh (71:06 - 71:10)
this is the so that we got let's go (71:08 - 71:12)
pikachu let's go eevee (71:10 - 71:15)
uh we got sword and shield (71:12 - 71:18)
we got bdsp which technically was made (71:15 - 71:20)
by ilka not game freak first two games (71:18 - 71:23)
were made by game freak we got (71:20 - 71:25)
um pokemon legends (71:23 - 71:27)
and then we got (71:25 - 71:28)
now we have (71:27 - 71:30)
scarlet and violet (71:28 - 71:33)
all main series games for whatever (71:30 - 71:36)
reason i don't know why people are still (71:33 - 71:38)
legends is not a main series game i (71:36 - 71:39)
don't (71:38 - 71:40)
who are you people (71:39 - 71:43)
why why why is this still a conversation (71:40 - 71:45)
exactly why is that conversation at all (71:43 - 71:46)
i would think about this (71:45 - 71:48)
it's always like a point in like well (71:46 - 71:50)
they changed the combat system because (71:48 - 71:52)
it's not a main series game it is a main (71:50 - 71:54)
series game they did change the combat (71:52 - 71:56)
that's fine you're still buying into (71:54 - 71:58)
don't even use the word series anymore (71:56 - 72:01)
it is a pokemon game (71:58 - 72:04)
period yeah i am so over the main series (72:01 - 72:07)
argument because it is (72:04 - 72:10)
it is a gatekeeper it is 100 a (72:07 - 72:13)
gatekeepey thing like i only played the (72:10 - 72:16)
main series pokemon games i don't play (72:13 - 72:18)
the offshoots (72:16 - 72:19)
and it's (72:18 - 72:22)
no not because you're good at offshoot (72:19 - 72:24)
doesn't mean you've there's there's also (72:22 - 72:26)
a misconception of these games come out (72:24 - 72:28)
too fast (72:26 - 72:29)
um (72:28 - 72:32)
so let's just break that down real quick (72:29 - 72:34)
the the (72:32 - 72:36)
easy way anyone can do this is when you (72:34 - 72:38)
beat the game you get what are called (72:36 - 72:39)
credits (72:38 - 72:41)
and on those credits it shows who worked (72:39 - 72:43)
on the video game and you can compare (72:41 - 72:45)
those credits to the credits of other (72:43 - 72:48)
video games and you will notice in both (72:45 - 72:50)
brilliant diamond and shining pearl the (72:48 - 72:52)
game that came after sword and shield (72:50 - 72:54)
and legends the (72:52 - 72:55)
two big people (72:54 - 72:57)
james turner who was the art director (72:55 - 73:01)
and also pokemon designer and omori (72:57 - 73:01)
um (73:01 - 73:03)
[Music] (73:01 - 73:06)
did not work on those two games (73:03 - 73:07)
and they haven't their names haven't (73:06 - 73:09)
been on anything since sword and shield (73:07 - 73:11)
and so (73:09 - 73:12)
uh (73:11 - 73:14)
based off these pokemon designs alone (73:12 - 73:15)
one of them being a very strong james (73:14 - 73:17)
turner design (73:15 - 73:20)
uh i'm sure we'll find out in a month or (73:17 - 73:21)
two that amore is (73:20 - 73:23)
the project lead and james turner is (73:21 - 73:25)
probably the art director (73:23 - 73:27)
but for legends (73:25 - 73:31)
uh the person in charge of that was (73:27 - 73:34)
oh gosh what is his name his name is (73:31 - 73:35)
escaping me right now he was the same (73:34 - 73:38)
guy in charge of ultrasound ultra moon (73:35 - 73:39)
again (73:38 - 73:42)
his name not listed on like let's go not (73:39 - 73:44)
listed on sword and shield they have two (73:42 - 73:46)
teams (73:44 - 73:48)
they probably have a third team somebody (73:46 - 73:50)
had to work on pokemon quest over there (73:48 - 73:52)
whether that was like 10 people or five (73:50 - 73:53)
people or two people (73:52 - 73:54)
who knows we probably look at the (73:53 - 73:57)
credits actually um (73:54 - 73:59)
and a lot of names in those credits are (73:57 - 74:01)
you know localization people or music (73:59 - 74:02)
people like if you're making music for (74:01 - 74:04)
sword and shield there might be 10 (74:02 - 74:07)
people making music (74:04 - 74:09)
they're not they're not programming (74:07 - 74:11)
pikachu shaders (74:09 - 74:12)
they're not laying out the next they're (74:11 - 74:16)
just making music i know that attitude (74:12 - 74:16)
everybody gets to vote on the fashion (74:17 - 74:21)
choices (74:19 - 74:22)
yeah (74:21 - 74:23)
so (74:22 - 74:25)
do (74:23 - 74:25)
if the game is ready the game's ready (74:27 - 74:29)
right (74:28 - 74:30)
right (74:29 - 74:32)
like like we (74:30 - 74:34)
we were like why is legends coming out (74:32 - 74:36)
so close to bdsp (74:34 - 74:39)
legends seemed fine it was a very (74:36 - 74:42)
fleshed out like not a perfect poke game (74:39 - 74:44)
i don't think a lot of games out there (74:42 - 74:45)
are perfect (74:44 - 74:46)
um but (74:45 - 74:48)
i think that game is a million percent (74:46 - 74:50)
worth 60 dollars i think it's great i (74:48 - 74:52)
would recommend it to anyone unless you (74:50 - 74:53)
were a competitive battler then i'd be (74:52 - 74:57)
like um maybe wait um (74:53 - 74:57)
but i don't (74:58 - 75:02)
how how long why why do pokemon fans (75:00 - 75:03)
want to be like let's just take your (75:02 - 75:05)
time take as much time as you need it if (75:03 - 75:06)
they're ready they're ready like what (75:05 - 75:09)
else i think there's this weird (75:06 - 75:11)
mentality that people have gotten into (75:09 - 75:14)
where it's very similar to i want to say (75:11 - 75:17)
how films used to be in the 90s let's i (75:14 - 75:20)
just maybe 80s and 90s where it was like (75:17 - 75:22)
when a film came out (75:20 - 75:25)
you wanted to see it in the theater and (75:22 - 75:28)
you only had a month a month and a half (75:25 - 75:30)
unless it was a huge blockbuster and (75:28 - 75:31)
then it was going to be gone from the (75:30 - 75:32)
theater (75:31 - 75:34)
and you may never have an opportunity to (75:32 - 75:35)
see it again (75:34 - 75:37)
and i think a lot of video game (75:35 - 75:39)
enthusiasts are (75:37 - 75:42)
thinking very much i have to play this (75:39 - 75:44)
game in the first month that it comes (75:42 - 75:46)
out or i will not be able to have the (75:44 - 75:49)
experience of that game which is (75:46 - 75:52)
false because games are eternal unless (75:49 - 75:53)
your (75:52 - 75:55)
legacy of kane and were only released on (75:53 - 75:59)
the ps2 and never released again (75:55 - 75:59)
i mean (75:59 - 76:02)
this narrative of like (76:02 - 76:06)
oh the the devs are overworked they need (76:04 - 76:07)
more time i just wish they would really (76:06 - 76:09)
take their time where where are we (76:07 - 76:10)
getting this information from like (76:09 - 76:13)
there's not even i i don't know (76:10 - 76:15)
the people on these the people on sword (76:13 - 76:16)
shield and people in legends are just (76:15 - 76:18)
they're just different people yeah (76:16 - 76:20)
exactly but i also want to point i want (76:18 - 76:23)
to lay a lot of what will talk about at (76:20 - 76:25)
the at the feet of (76:23 - 76:29)
spoiler people yeah and spoiler culture (76:25 - 76:32)
has gotten so (76:29 - 76:32)
rabid about not being spoiled and so (76:32 - 76:37)
since the internet can't control (76:35 - 76:39)
themselves and apparently neither can (76:37 - 76:40)
the people who don't want to be spoiled (76:39 - 76:42)
control themselves on the internet (76:40 - 76:44)
there's this idea that i have to play it (76:42 - 76:47)
within the (76:44 - 76:50)
first three days or everything about it (76:47 - 76:53)
is gonna get ruined for me and (76:50 - 76:54)
one just (76:53 - 76:57)
get over spoilers like like (76:54 - 76:59)
either take all the steps yourself and (76:57 - 77:01)
try to like stress to people (76:59 - 77:03)
hey i want to try to be as clean with (77:01 - 77:06)
this as possible and also people get (77:03 - 77:08)
into the habit of saying (77:06 - 77:10)
where are you at in this game instead of (77:08 - 77:12)
hey have you done this part (77:10 - 77:16)
yes as a courtesy but also (77:12 - 77:18)
there have been plenty of studies that (77:16 - 77:19)
saying (77:18 - 77:21)
being spoiled (77:19 - 77:24)
enhances your experience not ruins it uh (77:21 - 77:26)
if you just come to terms with (77:24 - 77:28)
it once you see something and you see it (77:26 - 77:30)
as cool and live living the emotions of (77:28 - 77:32)
seeing it cool that time (77:30 - 77:34)
you still aren't getting the context of (77:32 - 77:36)
it in game and you can still have the (77:34 - 77:40)
experience of seeing it in game as well (77:36 - 77:42)
like i've seen people are like mad that (77:40 - 77:45)
they spoiled the starters it's like (77:42 - 77:48)
i had a huge reaction to the starters i (77:45 - 77:50)
still have that when i see them in the (77:48 - 77:53)
game like they can exist (77:50 - 77:56)
in the same world like you need to come (77:53 - 77:59)
to peace with this spoiler idea because (77:56 - 78:02)
i think part of keeping part of anger at (77:59 - 78:05)
rush deliveries and part of people's (78:02 - 78:08)
just madness about i have to play this (78:05 - 78:10)
game without seeing how it's reviewed (78:08 - 78:13)
comes from this obsession around not (78:10 - 78:15)
being spoiled but i wouldn't use the (78:13 - 78:16)
word rush deliveries i don't think (78:15 - 78:18)
anything about these games is wrong no i (78:16 - 78:21)
don't think no i think people's people's (78:18 - 78:23)
reactions only pokemon game that ever (78:21 - 78:27)
felt rushed to me was sun and moon (78:23 - 78:27)
and because like there were so many (78:28 - 78:31)
things in ultra that like really fleshed (78:29 - 78:32)
it out (78:31 - 78:34)
and like sun and moon had to come out (78:32 - 78:35)
that year no matter what because of the (78:34 - 78:38)
20th anniversary but even even if it was (78:35 - 78:40)
quote unquote rushed (78:38 - 78:41)
at the time (78:40 - 78:43)
i would have said yes sun and moon is (78:41 - 78:45)
worth the forty dollars oh yeah (78:43 - 78:47)
definitely it's just that ultra sun and (78:45 - 78:48)
moon to me is a better game and if you (78:47 - 78:50)
were like i don't know which one to buy (78:48 - 78:52)
i'd be like buy ultra because there's (78:50 - 78:53)
more pokemon in it (78:52 - 78:55)
uh but i i would also say like they did (78:53 - 78:58)
that for platinum like i can't say (78:55 - 79:00)
diamond and pearl felt rush because they (78:58 - 79:01)
came out with the ultimate version and (79:00 - 79:03)
platinum i feel like the the same thing (79:01 - 79:04)
with sun and moon and ultra sun moon (79:03 - 79:06)
that they did with diamond and pearl and (79:04 - 79:08)
platinum yeah they put out the game that (79:06 - 79:10)
they wanted to do with a better story (79:08 - 79:12)
and then put out (79:10 - 79:14)
an enhanced version with more pokemon as (79:12 - 79:17)
their second game so i i disagreed that (79:14 - 79:20)
sun and moon felt rushed (79:17 - 79:20)
uh it's been (79:24 - 79:29)
18 months since the crown tundra (79:25 - 79:30)
oh yeah it's been a chunk of time it's (79:29 - 79:33)
been a challenge that whole dlc finished (79:30 - 79:36)
it wow that whole dlc was a it was a (79:33 - 79:38)
full year cycle (79:36 - 79:40)
yeah and it has been 18 months since (79:38 - 79:42)
crown tundra has arrived (79:40 - 79:44)
she has come out (79:42 - 79:48)
was 2019. that was right 20 years ago so (79:44 - 79:50)
it was it was announced (79:48 - 79:54)
february of 2019 which means they (79:50 - 79:56)
started working on it (79:54 - 79:58)
before they announced it (79:56 - 80:00)
i mean they even said in interviews we (79:58 - 80:02)
started sword and shield as soon as we (80:00 - 80:05)
finished sun and moon they that team (80:02 - 80:07)
didn't go on to work on ultra sun and (80:05 - 80:11)
moon that was a different team (80:07 - 80:13)
and then when they finished sword and (80:11 - 80:15)
shield there was another team that was (80:13 - 80:16)
working on the dlc (80:15 - 80:18)
and they (80:16 - 80:19)
that team that finished sword and shield (80:18 - 80:22)
is was has been working on this and game (80:19 - 80:24)
freak has said (80:22 - 80:26)
multiple interviews that their teams go (80:24 - 80:28)
back and forth they might take five (80:26 - 80:30)
people from a team currently working on (80:28 - 80:32)
a game and move them to another team and (80:30 - 80:34)
then get those people over so (80:32 - 80:35)
it's not (80:34 - 80:38)
there's there's nothing about (80:35 - 80:40)
like i guess at this point to me seeing (80:38 - 80:42)
an open world pokemon game is like not (80:40 - 80:43)
shocking (80:42 - 80:45)
like they they've already proven over (80:43 - 80:46)
the years they can do it like and (80:45 - 80:48)
they've been clearly giving signs that (80:46 - 80:49)
this is the direction they're heading (80:48 - 80:51)
like even if you're like well look at (80:49 - 80:53)
legends laid the groundwork okay well (80:51 - 80:56)
legends is not even a month old so they (80:53 - 80:58)
didn't like suddenly come up with like (80:56 - 80:59)
this game in the last month right (80:58 - 81:01)
they've been working on it since sword (80:59 - 81:03)
and shield obviously their teams are (81:01 - 81:06)
next to each other um (81:03 - 81:08)
and they they they did it with the crown (81:06 - 81:09)
tundra they did what the isle of armor (81:08 - 81:11)
they did with the original wild area (81:09 - 81:12)
like (81:11 - 81:15)
ride pokemon like weird deer and bravery (81:12 - 81:17)
and all these ride pokemon and legends (81:15 - 81:19)
they did all that stuff in sun and moon (81:17 - 81:21)
you could take sharpedo across the water (81:19 - 81:22)
you could take mudsdale against across (81:21 - 81:24)
the rocks like (81:22 - 81:26)
you could take stoutland like scotland (81:24 - 81:28)
is just ursaluna like (81:26 - 81:30)
every pokemon game they have always (81:28 - 81:32)
built on top of each other (81:30 - 81:33)
the whole like well maybe they're just (81:32 - 81:36)
testing the water with legends (81:33 - 81:37)
no they were confident with legends (81:36 - 81:39)
there is no testing confident with (81:37 - 81:40)
legends (81:39 - 81:42)
well i mean they were confident with (81:40 - 81:44)
legends as a game i still think they (81:42 - 81:45)
were too timid in the decisions they (81:44 - 81:48)
made with and and who knows they expand (81:45 - 81:52)
on it in this game yeah it comes forward (81:48 - 81:54)
i mean i love what you said greg because (81:52 - 81:57)
i i could just imagine like (81:54 - 82:00)
rolling and dodging right or yeah yeah (81:57 - 82:03)
and like have your pokemon kind of move (82:00 - 82:05)
with you as you move they showed that (82:03 - 82:06)
you can move around the battle (82:05 - 82:09)
roll have the pokemon kind of follow you (82:06 - 82:10)
a little as you move through the battle (82:09 - 82:12)
and see how that affects the battle (82:10 - 82:14)
anyways that's not even with even with (82:12 - 82:15)
like let's go pikachu let's go eevee and (82:14 - 82:17)
sword and shield (82:15 - 82:19)
like it's not like six months in to (82:17 - 82:20)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee sales (82:19 - 82:22)
they were like hey maybe we should put (82:20 - 82:24)
walking pokemon walking around and sword (82:22 - 82:26)
and chill like no they that they were (82:24 - 82:27)
committed (82:26 - 82:29)
like that was not like a last minute (82:27 - 82:31)
change well (82:29 - 82:34)
it felt like a last minute change (82:31 - 82:34)
we don't know anything about the (82:36 - 82:40)
catching they did say you can catch and (82:37 - 82:42)
battle wild pokemon (82:40 - 82:44)
um theoretically you can technically (82:42 - 82:46)
battle and catch pokemon in legends i (82:44 - 82:48)
don't know why you would (82:46 - 82:49)
you can (82:48 - 82:51)
catch every you can catch every legend (82:49 - 82:53)
in that game without that well not every (82:51 - 82:54)
legend but almost every legend without (82:53 - 82:56)
battling it (82:54 - 82:58)
um i think reggie gigas they make you (82:56 - 83:00)
battle right yeah you have to battle (82:58 - 83:01)
with gk yeah you have to battle reggie (83:00 - 83:02)
giggs but you can catch all the forces (83:01 - 83:05)
of nature without actually engaging in a (83:02 - 83:08)
battle um (83:05 - 83:08)
it looks like it's taking place in spain (83:08 - 83:14)
absolutely yes well it is very let's be (83:11 - 83:17)
clear it is very spanish inspired (83:14 - 83:19)
it is not (83:17 - 83:21)
no more than (83:19 - 83:24)
gallery was all an exact replica of the (83:21 - 83:26)
british isles correct this is not an (83:24 - 83:29)
exact replica of spain but it is clearly (83:26 - 83:31)
spanish influenced (83:29 - 83:33)
yeah i think um (83:31 - 83:34)
you know you look back and it's easier (83:33 - 83:36)
to see in retrospect of like why is (83:34 - 83:39)
legends coming out so early (83:36 - 83:41)
because they they they clearly had this (83:39 - 83:42)
ready like they knew that this was the (83:41 - 83:44)
announcement they wanted to tell what (83:42 - 83:46)
are we doing with competitive in sword (83:44 - 83:48)
and shield what's happening after august (83:46 - 83:50)
now we know what's happening after (83:48 - 83:52)
august i do not think (83:50 - 83:55)
it is a coincidence that niantic a week (83:52 - 83:58)
ago said we're doing a safari zone in (83:55 - 84:01)
spain yeah (83:58 - 84:04)
and then this game happens i don't think (84:01 - 84:05)
that's a coincidence i think that was (84:04 - 84:08)
like hey we're doing and it's i i am i (84:05 - 84:11)
would probably take a uh i'd probably (84:08 - 84:13)
put money down that niantic didn't know (84:11 - 84:15)
this either they were probably told (84:13 - 84:16)
hey (84:15 - 84:18)
yeah probably we want a spain event (84:16 - 84:20)
we want you to announce it around this (84:18 - 84:22)
time i mean i'm sure niantic has a whole (84:20 - 84:24)
schedule for the year i am i'm sure they (84:22 - 84:26)
know i mean janine is on it yes (84:24 - 84:28)
i am sure they know what's happening in (84:26 - 84:29)
in (84:28 - 84:31)
what is that spain event is it march or (84:29 - 84:33)
is it april i think it's (84:31 - 84:34)
i don't know you were you were thinking (84:33 - 84:36)
about it i was thinking i was thinking (84:34 - 84:40)
yeah so what give me one image or item (84:36 - 84:42)
from the trailer that made you because i (84:40 - 84:45)
have one that like screened spain to me (84:42 - 84:46)
when i (84:45 - 84:47)
thought it gave it a little more thought (84:46 - 84:49)
and everything so greg what was what's (84:47 - 84:52)
one thing that was kind of so (84:49 - 84:53)
there is (84:52 - 84:56)
in the trailer there's a (84:53 - 84:56)
shot i think it's a shot of (84:57 - 85:01)
pikachu (85:00 - 85:04)
in front of a building and the (85:01 - 85:05)
building's (85:04 - 85:07)
tiling is (85:05 - 85:08)
the oh i know what you're talking about (85:07 - 85:11)
is the is the triangle texturey tiles (85:08 - 85:14)
and immediately went oh that's barcelona (85:11 - 85:16)
okay interesting (85:14 - 85:17)
because there's the cathedral in (85:16 - 85:19)
barcelona and then when they went to the (85:17 - 85:20)
cathedral because i think they did that (85:19 - 85:21)
and then went to the cathedral i'm like (85:20 - 85:23)
oh now it really is (85:21 - 85:25)
it really is barcelona and that's like (85:23 - 85:27)
uh gowdy i think was the yeah yes you (85:25 - 85:29)
designed that cathedral (85:27 - 85:32)
steve what did you have (85:29 - 85:36)
uh i thought it was spain based off (85:32 - 85:40)
um the like the r the roofs (85:36 - 85:40)
styling clay tiles yes yeah the clay (85:44 - 85:49)
things so one other thing that stuck out (85:46 - 85:52)
to me which seemed a little weird when (85:49 - 85:54)
they first showed it and then i thought (85:52 - 85:55)
about it a little more as people were (85:54 - 85:57)
starting to say spain and i was like oh (85:55 - 86:00)
this is very obvious (85:57 - 86:02)
is the windmills (86:00 - 86:05)
yeah and because the classic work of (86:02 - 86:08)
spanish language literature is don (86:05 - 86:09)
quixote (86:08 - 86:12)
and the whole story is that he used to (86:09 - 86:14)
attack windmills thinking that they were (86:12 - 86:16)
giants (86:14 - 86:18)
that's like literally ban of la mancha (86:16 - 86:20)
if you need it in english but the whole (86:18 - 86:23)
story is that he was a very old man who (86:20 - 86:25)
was a knight and he would go out on (86:23 - 86:27)
missions to attack windmills and that is (86:25 - 86:30)
so if you look at anything spain if it's (86:27 - 86:34)
not a spanish galleon ship it is a very (86:30 - 86:37)
old style windmill with a man on a horse (86:34 - 86:39)
like looking like he's gonna attack (86:37 - 86:42)
and in the hou the housing inside the (86:39 - 86:44)
house the (86:42 - 86:46)
color scheme (86:44 - 86:47)
felt very spanish and then there's the (86:46 - 86:49)
picture of the (86:47 - 86:52)
uh dancer it's not flamenco it's the (86:49 - 86:54)
other one whatever uh which is uh (86:52 - 86:57)
oricorio no no no (86:54 - 87:01)
of a woman dancing yeah it's like (86:57 - 87:01)
um (87:02 - 87:05)
a couple things (87:15 - 87:20)
the the pokemon names themselves really (87:16 - 87:22)
give away the the spanish vibe (87:20 - 87:24)
um (87:22 - 87:26)
the (87:24 - 87:27)
so i wanted to point that out i also (87:26 - 87:30)
want to point out that the uh fue fue (87:27 - 87:32)
coco (87:30 - 87:35)
is not an apple he's like a chili pepper (87:32 - 87:37)
with an apple face it's a flamin hot (87:35 - 87:39)
cheeto (87:37 - 87:42)
somebody said that like the white face (87:39 - 87:44)
is supposed to be like a skull and it's (87:42 - 87:46)
supposed to be a spanish thing hollow (87:44 - 87:49)
from bleach yeah so the thing is like if (87:46 - 87:52)
you look at the face it does look like a (87:49 - 87:53)
slice in an apple (87:52 - 87:56)
so i get what people are saying but if (87:53 - 87:57)
you look at the whole thing it is a (87:56 - 88:00)
pepper shape (87:57 - 88:00)
fire fire yeah (88:04 - 88:11)
um coco is like you know the the tapu (88:06 - 88:13)
coco is like that spanish movie from (88:11 - 88:15)
disney yeah (88:13 - 88:19)
that was a type of coco joke um hissuian (88:15 - 88:20)
zoroark is shown in one of the (88:19 - 88:23)
screenshots so that's just something to (88:20 - 88:24)
just (88:23 - 88:26)
to uh point out (88:24 - 88:28)
there's a fountain with a dratini (88:26 - 88:32)
there is um (88:28 - 88:32)
there is uh (88:32 - 88:35)
geez the first thing that stood out to (88:34 - 88:37)
me and what made me so excited and so (88:35 - 88:40)
happy is just how colorful this game is (88:37 - 88:41)
yeah (88:40 - 88:42)
i would (88:41 - 88:44)
if you if you are listening to the show (88:42 - 88:44)
and you've been playing a bunch of (88:44 - 88:46)
legends i don't blame you legends is (88:44 - 88:48)
very good if you haven't gone back to (88:46 - 88:50)
sword and shield (88:48 - 88:50)
just (88:50 - 88:52)
close out legends and go back to sword (88:50 - 88:53)
and shield it is (88:52 - 88:54)
night and day (88:53 - 88:58)
in color (88:54 - 88:58)
so much color biggest complaint about (88:58 - 89:02)
the graphics in arceus is how (89:00 - 89:05)
monotone and sort of muted everything (89:02 - 89:07)
it's because they hadn't invented colors (89:05 - 89:09)
they haven't been true (89:07 - 89:11)
um are we going to talk about the orange (89:09 - 89:13)
and grapes (89:11 - 89:15)
what (89:13 - 89:17)
the [ __ ] okay we we don't know about the (89:15 - 89:19)
orange we haven't (89:17 - 89:20)
well i don't know they had like a (89:19 - 89:22)
charcuterie board in the office right so (89:20 - 89:26)
other stuff oh there is in the bowl (89:22 - 89:27)
there are orange and grapes (89:26 - 89:28)
the (89:27 - 89:31)
there's two crests on one of the doors (89:28 - 89:33)
if you freeze it there's one that has an (89:31 - 89:35)
orange slice an orange symbol the other (89:33 - 89:37)
has a grape symbol (89:35 - 89:38)
and then the (89:37 - 89:40)
outfits (89:38 - 89:42)
in scarlet they're wearing (89:40 - 89:44)
they look like they have an orange crest (89:42 - 89:45)
on their (89:44 - 89:48)
shirt and they're wearing orangey pants (89:45 - 89:51)
and in violet they have a more grapey (89:48 - 89:53)
feel and a great so i don't know what (89:51 - 89:54)
the orange and grape (89:53 - 89:58)
ultimately represents but that has a big (89:54 - 90:00)
that seems to be a big symbolism between (89:58 - 90:02)
the two games because the trainer (90:00 - 90:04)
outfits are different colored between (90:02 - 90:08)
the two versions (90:04 - 90:10)
huh you know what bothers me what (90:08 - 90:13)
is how okay so you remember they do like (90:10 - 90:16)
black and white ruby sapphire uh sword (90:13 - 90:17)
and shield (90:16 - 90:18)
the f (90:17 - 90:20)
the fonts are different for scarlet and (90:18 - 90:22)
violet yeah yeah okay that's like the (90:20 - 90:24)
first time they did that right yeah (90:22 - 90:27)
but here wait step back one one step (90:24 - 90:28)
back (90:27 - 90:30)
the vibrant colors (90:28 - 90:34)
many symbols and signs are given to you (90:30 - 90:36)
that you got to throw out your current (90:34 - 90:39)
switch and get an oled yeah yeah (90:36 - 90:41)
yeah because even in the screenshot they (90:39 - 90:43)
have like a pile of old switches and (90:41 - 90:45)
then only the oled one is plugged in (90:43 - 90:47)
yeah you're going to want to play this (90:45 - 90:47)
on (90:47 - 90:49)
subliminal marketing right here i also (90:47 - 90:52)
want to say that (90:49 - 90:52)
the (90:52 - 90:54)
scarlet font gives an old world feel and (90:55 - 91:00)
the violet fun is a futuristic feeling (90:58 - 91:03)
which makes me (91:00 - 91:03)
so it makes me feel like the (91:04 - 91:10)
uh black and white future city (91:07 - 91:12)
nature tree yeah (91:10 - 91:14)
i got a very strong feel from those (91:12 - 91:17)
fonts so i don't know what all like (91:14 - 91:19)
there's all these little details that (91:17 - 91:21)
i'm like okay what (91:19 - 91:24)
what could be (91:21 - 91:24)
this story and there's a whole like (91:24 - 91:29)
there's that whole scene of like ancient (91:26 - 91:31)
antique treasures (91:29 - 91:32)
because there's like an arc there's like (91:31 - 91:35)
an archaeology feel in that room because (91:32 - 91:37)
there's like a pile of (91:35 - 91:40)
antiquities so i all these things i'm (91:37 - 91:43)
like okay so are the two versions gonna (91:40 - 91:46)
be dealing with slightly different (91:43 - 91:48)
like is the villain team going to be (91:46 - 91:49)
like a (91:48 - 91:52)
uh (91:49 - 91:52)
hoenn water land is going to be future (91:52 - 91:56)
past like we want to preserve the past (91:55 - 91:58)
we want to push towards the future it's (91:56 - 92:01)
going to have a more hoe and aorus feel (91:58 - 92:03)
of two teams that are going to appear (92:01 - 92:05)
but depending on which game you have (92:03 - 92:07)
you're going to focus on the futurist (92:05 - 92:09)
plot line or the (92:07 - 92:10)
uh (92:09 - 92:13)
concert conservationist plot line like (92:10 - 92:14)
is this going to be a time thing that (92:13 - 92:16)
they that they that they are fighting (92:14 - 92:20)
with um simply simply because the (92:16 - 92:22)
the fonts are so different and they are (92:20 - 92:24)
already clearly drawing distinct lines (92:22 - 92:26)
between the two games it's going to be (92:24 - 92:27)
like the lake house the lake house (92:26 - 92:29)
that's the movie where they were sending (92:27 - 92:31)
letters through time letters through (92:29 - 92:32)
time past (92:31 - 92:34)
yeah you're gonna okay so it's it's uh (92:32 - 92:38)
the evil teams are team laranja (92:34 - 92:40)
laurent (92:38 - 92:40)
there's a there's a screenshot of (92:43 - 92:49)
the what i'm assuming is the trainer's (92:46 - 92:50)
house (92:49 - 92:52)
um or it could be a professor's house it (92:50 - 92:54)
could be the professor's house uh you (92:52 - 92:56)
could see like a garden and then the (92:54 - 92:58)
brick sidewalk and there's like a (92:56 - 92:59)
mailbox and you can see the pumpkin (92:58 - 93:00)
patch and there's like a female (92:59 - 93:02)
character running to the door (93:00 - 93:05)
um and it just kind of reminded me (93:02 - 93:07)
like the beginning of sword and shield (93:05 - 93:09)
and i and this kind of plays into the (93:07 - 93:11)
open worldness like when you walk out (93:09 - 93:12)
the door of sword and shield (93:11 - 93:13)
you (93:12 - 93:15)
walk you're in that town (93:13 - 93:18)
and then you walk immediately into (93:15 - 93:20)
the first route seamlessly and then you (93:18 - 93:24)
walk into the next town seamlessly (93:20 - 93:25)
and then you walk into the route after (93:24 - 93:27)
that seamlessly like again they they've (93:25 - 93:30)
been doing this yeah (93:27 - 93:32)
and i think (93:30 - 93:34)
going from sword and shield (93:32 - 93:37)
to the crown tundra to the isle of armor (93:34 - 93:40)
like they really cranked it up (93:37 - 93:41)
very quickly (93:40 - 93:42)
and (93:41 - 93:43)
their (93:42 - 93:46)
legends i think they cranked it like (93:43 - 93:47)
for as slow (93:46 - 93:50)
as as this company has been and i think (93:47 - 93:52)
that's kind of what my biggest problem (93:50 - 93:54)
with the gen 4 games were is like what (93:52 - 93:56)
did you even do here besides like ad (93:54 - 93:58)
online and like that's that was (93:56 - 94:00)
important right like trading online (93:58 - 94:02)
battling online communicating very (94:00 - 94:04)
important but like (94:02 - 94:07)
every every game was doing that every (94:04 - 94:08)
game was like let's play with each other (94:07 - 94:10)
let's connect with each other so it (94:08 - 94:12)
wasn't like unique to pokemon (94:10 - 94:15)
and then gen 5 they did a lot of stuff (94:12 - 94:16)
um (94:15 - 94:18)
gen 5 was definitely a game where they (94:16 - 94:20)
listened to the fans (94:18 - 94:21)
and they were like (94:20 - 94:23)
let's make it more accessible (94:21 - 94:26)
let's add hardcore features let's (94:23 - 94:28)
just nothing but quality of life in gen (94:26 - 94:29)
5. (94:28 - 94:32)
um and then gen 6 was the move to 3d (94:29 - 94:34)
yep (94:32 - 94:38)
from the jump from from gen 8 to gen 9 (94:34 - 94:38)
seems awesome like just they they just (94:39 - 94:42)
like (94:41 - 94:44)
feels like they figured it out maybe you (94:42 - 94:46)
know not the tree graphics but like (94:44 - 94:49)
everything i knew that was going to come (94:46 - 94:51)
up the trees the grass the slope up to (94:49 - 94:53)
the trees (94:51 - 94:56)
protect against toxic i am over your (94:53 - 94:58)
toxicity (94:56 - 94:59)
uh (94:58 - 95:02)
one thing i do kind of notice though is (94:59 - 95:03)
that they mention a lot about pokemon (95:02 - 95:05)
battles and building your pokedex and (95:03 - 95:07)
everything and not a lot about trainer (95:05 - 95:10)
battles (95:07 - 95:10)
so (95:10 - 95:13)
yeah i mean like that's that's an (95:11 - 95:16)
interesting choice i'm also the i was (95:13 - 95:18)
thinking about this too if it is truly (95:16 - 95:20)
if it is going to be truly truly open (95:18 - 95:21)
world (95:20 - 95:24)
i am curious how they're handling the (95:21 - 95:27)
eight gatekeep moments (95:24 - 95:30)
because if it's open world and you can (95:27 - 95:33)
truly go anywhere (95:30 - 95:36)
what are the gyms or trials or whatever (95:33 - 95:38)
going to look like in this game (95:36 - 95:39)
so (95:38 - 95:42)
one thing that has like an idea that has (95:39 - 95:44)
come to me that is based in (95:42 - 95:48)
whispers of nothingness besides the (95:44 - 95:51)
the gold bars and chalices and doubloons (95:48 - 95:54)
or whatever that were a brief flash in (95:51 - 95:56)
the that graphic (95:54 - 95:58)
is what if it refers it's around like (95:56 - 96:00)
the seven cities of gold (95:58 - 96:02)
which were uh (96:00 - 96:04)
a lot a lot of the spanish explorers (96:02 - 96:07)
believed were in south america that they (96:04 - 96:09)
were looking for and was a really good (96:07 - 96:13)
cartoon of the of the 80s um (96:09 - 96:15)
and what if it's like (96:13 - 96:16)
you have to (96:15 - 96:20)
unlock some mystery (96:16 - 96:24)
and it will give you access to (96:20 - 96:26)
an area that is like this is the (96:24 - 96:28)
challenge that you now have to like you (96:26 - 96:31)
have to find the one of the seven cities (96:28 - 96:34)
unlock it and then that's the challenge (96:31 - 96:36)
that will be your (96:34 - 96:37)
regulating (96:36 - 96:40)
stage (96:37 - 96:40)
i mean i'm open to anything (96:48 - 96:54)
also do you think that the spider web (96:49 - 96:57)
drape cloth on that chair looks like (96:54 - 97:01)
viola's first gym (96:57 - 97:01)
because it has like little drips on it (97:01 - 97:05)
i think in the picture like it's hard to (97:04 - 97:07)
see because it goes by quick i feel like (97:05 - 97:09)
that symbol is something (97:07 - 97:11)
yeah i kind of felt like it was almost (97:09 - 97:13)
like a map (97:11 - 97:15)
like a map to a building and hallways of (97:13 - 97:18)
an like an octagonal building or (97:15 - 97:20)
something like that with sections marked (97:18 - 97:21)
out (97:20 - 97:24)
when they uh do the pan through delfino (97:21 - 97:26)
square (97:24 - 97:28)
uh you can see all (97:26 - 97:30)
18 type symbols so it doesn't look like (97:28 - 97:33)
there's any new types (97:30 - 97:35)
but also it seems that they took those (97:33 - 97:37)
symbols from brilliant diamond shining (97:35 - 97:39)
pearl the like fighting symbol fire (97:37 - 97:41)
symbol uh which is really good for (97:39 - 97:42)
accessibility (97:41 - 97:45)
um to have those symbols available (97:42 - 97:47)
the they really seem to focus on (97:45 - 97:50)
different weather they're like here's (97:47 - 97:52)
the sun rising here's fog here's a (97:50 - 97:55)
sandstorm here's rain (97:52 - 97:57)
which is like not like that shouldn't be (97:55 - 97:59)
shocking to anyone who's played legends (97:57 - 98:01)
or has played sword and shield they (97:59 - 98:02)
really i think they kind of went (98:01 - 98:04)
overboard with some of the weather stuff (98:02 - 98:05)
in sword and shield (98:04 - 98:07)
it was awful to play that game in a (98:05 - 98:10)
sandstorm (98:07 - 98:10)
um (98:12 - 98:15)
yeah i think there there's moments where (98:13 - 98:18)
this this trailer looks pretty rough and (98:15 - 98:19)
then there's moments where like when (98:18 - 98:21)
they show the close-up to the viper (98:19 - 98:23)
you're like whoa (98:21 - 98:25)
like how did we go from like (98:23 - 98:28)
one screenshot to like um how amazing (98:25 - 98:30)
this viper looks it's kind of it's (98:28 - 98:31)
almost jarring that like there's not a (98:30 - 98:34)
consistency here but i i wouldn't expect (98:31 - 98:36)
it's like a (98:34 - 98:37)
they probably had this trailer ready for (98:36 - 98:39)
months like it is (98:37 - 98:39)
yeah (98:39 - 98:41)
nothing as we learn from sword and (98:39 - 98:43)
shield and let's go and and everything (98:41 - 98:45)
you know it's gonna get it's gonna look (98:43 - 98:47)
better closer to (98:45 - 98:49)
release but i just that's a viper shot (98:47 - 98:51)
really stood out to me of like oh wow (98:49 - 98:53)
why you like i can see the scales on the (98:51 - 98:55)
viper it's gonna look better on that (98:53 - 98:59)
oled switch that i don't have (98:55 - 99:03)
it's almost like this game has um (98:59 - 99:05)
do you know how (99:03 - 99:05)
auras and sun and moon look different (99:06 - 99:10)
but they still look like pretty good (99:08 - 99:12)
yeah like like sun and moon didn't look (99:10 - 99:14)
like dr like much better than auras but (99:12 - 99:15)
they (99:14 - 99:16)
the art style is different so it looks (99:15 - 99:18)
different (99:16 - 99:19)
i don't know if this looks better than (99:18 - 99:21)
sword and shield but like you can you (99:19 - 99:24)
can see that the style is like clearly (99:21 - 99:25)
different right like story shield has (99:24 - 99:27)
like this (99:25 - 99:28)
i don't i don't want to say that sword (99:27 - 99:30)
shield looks more cartoony (99:28 - 99:32)
because like let's go is very (99:30 - 99:33)
cheapish (99:32 - 99:36)
but this doesn't look realistic like the (99:33 - 99:38)
x and y was going for like i like i like (99:36 - 99:39)
where it's at i really like it i just (99:38 - 99:41)
don't know how to explain it i think (99:39 - 99:43)
this is more on par with legends (99:41 - 99:44)
like i think i find a lot of (99:43 - 99:46)
similarities in the graphic style with (99:44 - 99:47)
legends (99:46 - 99:48)
yeah (99:47 - 99:50)
i'm gonna have to say like (99:48 - 99:52)
i could see that like the water is (99:50 - 99:54)
terrible absolutely i recently had my (99:52 - 99:58)
eyes open to how fast (99:54 - 100:00)
a company can make graphical im (99:58 - 100:03)
improvements from the final fantasy live (100:00 - 100:04)
letter (100:03 - 100:06)
because they're like hi we've been (100:04 - 100:07)
working on (100:06 - 100:10)
improving the the faces and textures for (100:07 - 100:13)
just a month and it's (100:10 - 100:15)
shocking (100:13 - 100:17)
how different they are so (100:15 - 100:19)
like people are like oh they that's what (100:17 - 100:20)
it looks like and they can never make (100:19 - 100:23)
changes in in by the time the game came (100:20 - 100:27)
out like i've already seen living proof (100:23 - 100:30)
of what can happen in just a month of (100:27 - 100:33)
saying we are only going to focus on (100:30 - 100:35)
this it was (100:33 - 100:38)
night and day so like (100:35 - 100:41)
i have i am now even more like whatever (100:38 - 100:44)
we get in the trailers is absolutely not (100:41 - 100:46)
going to be focusing what we get the end (100:44 - 100:47)
because they can turn these things (100:46 - 100:49)
around a lot faster than i thought they (100:47 - 100:50)
ever could also you know one thing that (100:49 - 100:51)
i've been thinking about that i don't (100:50 - 100:53)
think we've ever mentioned is (100:51 - 100:55)
they're they're delivering these (100:53 - 100:57)
trailers over youtube which means it has (100:55 - 100:59)
to go over an internet connection and it (100:57 - 101:01)
has to be playable on (100:59 - 101:04)
phones computers tvs (101:01 - 101:08)
right they're going to render it down (101:04 - 101:10)
so that it is an acceptable experience (101:08 - 101:12)
for even the worst (101:10 - 101:15)
player or like to to well to a level (101:12 - 101:17)
which you don't have to do when it's a (101:15 - 101:19)
device that's directly connected to your (101:17 - 101:21)
program or you're playing it directly on (101:19 - 101:23)
that device to screen right then you can (101:21 - 101:25)
do the full render highest quality (101:23 - 101:27)
graphics so it's very hard (101:25 - 101:29)
i mean we grew up in the 80s greg we (101:27 - 101:30)
know (101:29 - 101:31)
how bad (101:30 - 101:35)
vhs television can look oh yeah (101:31 - 101:37)
so (101:35 - 101:38)
i that's why i find it very hard to (101:37 - 101:41)
judge graphics you know at this stage (101:38 - 101:43)
and also as delivered through youtube (101:41 - 101:46)
even if youtube does offer a 4k option (101:43 - 101:48)
not everybody's going to have a 4k (101:46 - 101:49)
player and if you're delivering (101:48 - 101:52)
only 4k video to somebody who's over a (101:49 - 101:55)
cellular signal on an iphone 6 (101:52 - 101:56)
they're going to have a very bad (101:55 - 101:57)
experience (101:56 - 101:58)
yeah (101:57 - 102:00)
i just i just really like this art (101:58 - 102:01)
direction (102:00 - 102:04)
oh yeah i i mean so far i i like how (102:01 - 102:07)
colorful it is but given given sort of (102:04 - 102:08)
the region (102:07 - 102:12)
uh like i expect it to be very colorful (102:08 - 102:13)
um yeah (102:12 - 102:15)
i i said this before i just didn't like (102:13 - 102:17)
the art direction of legends i think (102:15 - 102:18)
legends looks fine i think it's it's (102:17 - 102:19)
just very (102:18 - 102:21)
brown (102:19 - 102:22)
i think it's very exciting that it's in (102:21 - 102:24)
a mediterranean (102:22 - 102:26)
feel which you know is very sunny and (102:24 - 102:30)
vibrant and you know beachy and (102:26 - 102:32)
um i'm excited i'm excited for (102:30 - 102:34)
everything that i've seen so far i did i (102:32 - 102:37)
will freely admit i did not expect this (102:34 - 102:39)
at all today and the minute it started (102:37 - 102:40)
i'm like (102:39 - 102:44)
i'm so happy (102:40 - 102:44)
yeah but again i just i don't know what (102:46 - 102:49)
they would have done i i guess they (102:48 - 102:51)
could have announced it in march or (102:49 - 102:52)
april or or (102:51 - 102:54)
or whatever but there had to be a poke (102:52 - 102:56)
there had to be some game coming out in (102:54 - 102:57)
november so there had to be something (102:56 - 102:59)
coming out november i just didn't i just (102:57 - 103:00)
didn't think it was going to be actually (102:59 - 103:02)
be gen 9. (103:00 - 103:05)
they had the briefest glimpse of a map (103:02 - 103:07)
of the region on that oled (103:05 - 103:10)
yeah the in-game oled and it's just like (103:07 - 103:14)
why can't i see the whole thing (103:10 - 103:17)
um (103:14 - 103:17)
is there well we'll wrap up here (103:17 - 103:20)
obviously (103:19 - 103:21)
well we can continue talking about this (103:20 - 103:22)
next week in the following week and (103:21 - 103:24)
whenever they decide to do a second (103:22 - 103:26)
trailer or a third trailer or whatever (103:24 - 103:28)
uh probably not anytime soon especially (103:26 - 103:30)
with what's happening in the world (103:28 - 103:31)
uh (103:30 - 103:33)
but is is there a starter that stands (103:31 - 103:36)
out to you both (103:33 - 103:36)
uh i will just say this (103:37 - 103:42)
i am torn between (103:40 - 103:45)
spurgadito and quacksley (103:42 - 103:48)
uh that chili pepper can go to the trash (103:45 - 103:51)
where it belongs (103:48 - 103:53)
and even though i call it the flaming (103:51 - 103:55)
hot cheeto (103:53 - 103:56)
uh (103:55 - 103:59)
i'm i'm kind of drawn to fue coco just (103:56 - 104:00)
for the memes (103:59 - 104:01)
you know (104:00 - 104:04)
i i hate it but (104:01 - 104:04)
i don't want another cat (104:05 - 104:08)
yeah (104:07 - 104:10)
you know (104:08 - 104:10)
i (104:10 - 104:12)

thing about an australian power plant i (106:31 - 106:36)
didn't mention what type of power plant (106:34 - 106:38)
it was that was for you to figure out on (106:36 - 106:40)
your own closing down early because of (106:38 - 106:43)
the competition from renewable resources (106:40 - 106:45)
and it's going to be turned into a 700 (106:43 - 106:48)
megawatt battery used to store energy (106:45 - 106:50)
and i said made a reference to the (106:48 - 106:52)
government and citizens of galler who (106:50 - 106:54)
should consider doing the same thing (106:52 - 106:56)

area (106:56 - 106:57)
where (106:57 - 107:00)
its predecessor burns a certain fossil (106:57 - 107:03)
fuel not mentioned (107:00 - 107:04)

that it's been known to drop that fossil (107:04 - 107:09)
fuel i don't know in what form (107:06 - 107:12)
