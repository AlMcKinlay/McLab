well in the last couple of weeks for (2:28 - 2:32)

Thursday night it's just I'm that I'm (2:44 - 2:49)
not blaming you it's just a lot I i took (2:46 - 2:52)
on a lot on my plate at once which is (2:49 - 2:55)

dollar they put in the bucket we tell (3:18 - 3:22)
one more joke per episode yeah that's it (3:19 - 3:25)
that's it's the behind-the-scenes i had (3:22 - 3:28)
a but low if you are new to it's super (3:25 - 3:29)
effective and i just preference that (3:28 - 3:32)
because we've been sitting in the top (3:29 - 3:34)
like 50 of (3:32 - 3:37)
games & hobbies for ever since sun and (3:34 - 3:38)
moon has been announced we've been doing (3:37 - 3:40)
very well we're we're up like twenty (3:38 - 3:43)
percent and downloads to see how i used (3:40 - 3:45)
i used a percentage since i didn't (3:43 - 3:47)
reveal our actual oh this is a different (3:45 - 3:49)
spin off than i thought this is the (3:47 - 3:51)
spin-off where we talk about how the (3:49 - 3:53)
podcast is doing this is the this is the (3:51 - 3:55)
podcast where we talked about at what (3:53 - 3:58)
position our podcast is I'm on the wrong (3:55 - 4:02)
show I gotta go this is this is one now (3:58 - 4:04)
this is statistics cast and he's got a (4:02 - 4:07)
counterpoint by telling me how I (4:04 - 4:10)
completely screwed up my other spin-off (4:07 - 4:13)
podcast and and how that has no numbers (4:10 - 4:16)
d remembers I was gonna say I was gonna (4:13 - 4:18)
say though that you know the show's been (4:16 - 4:19)
doing really good so we've been getting (4:18 - 4:21)
new listeners so I want a preference (4:19 - 4:24)
that we purposely spend the first 10 to (4:21 - 4:27)
15 minutes of our episodes not talking (4:24 - 4:30)
about Pokemon disregarding her intro (4:27 - 4:33)
that was a bit pokemon focused but I oh (4:30 - 4:37)
I so what I ended up doing as as my (4:33 - 4:38)
friends were coming into town for (4:37 - 4:42)
Wrestlemania and everything is I cleaned (4:38 - 4:44)
my whole house started cleaning the (4:42 - 4:45)
basement because I was also getting (4:44 - 4:46)
ready for Midwest game and classic which (4:45 - 4:48)
is we're recording this on Wednesday (4:46 - 4:50)
night not our typical recording schedule (4:48 - 4:52)
and Midwest gaming classic is held in (4:50 - 4:54)
your basement yes it's held in my (4:52 - 4:56)
basement it is held at the Sheraton (4:54 - 4:58)
Hotel in brookfield Wisconsin so I've (4:56 - 5:00)
trying to get everything organized I (4:58 - 5:02)
usually bring four or five totes worth (5:00 - 5:04)
of stuff to you know set up the show and (5:02 - 5:06)
whatnot so I'm emptying totes and (5:04 - 5:08)
cleaning and everything and I open this (5:06 - 5:11)
tote and it's nothing of like blu rays (5:08 - 5:17)
and dvds and xbox 360 games it's been in (5:11 - 5:18)
my basement since I moved here which was (5:17 - 5:21)
almost two years ago I was like I I (5:18 - 5:25)
don't want at the tote that these that (5:21 - 5:28)
are holding this this media is worth (5:25 - 5:32)
more than the media its itself like I (5:28 - 5:36)
would rather have the tote then the tote (5:32 - 5:37)
hold this garbage that I have to move (5:36 - 5:40)
when I eventually move and so I went to (5:37 - 5:43)
the Amazon training program and entered (5:40 - 5:47)
true romance DVD forty cents perfect (5:43 - 5:50)
fine take it I end up doing that for (5:47 - 5:52)
you're only allowed to do 50 items per (5:50 - 5:55)
transaction I did 150 items they were (5:52 - 5:58)
blu-rays they were GameCube games Xbox (5:55 - 6:01)
games ps2 games dvds I walked away with (5:58 - 6:05)
six hundred dollars hey and I got three (6:01 - 6:08)
totes that I could use in my basement so (6:05 - 6:10)
not only did I save space but I got rid (6:08 - 6:13)
of a bunch of junk and I have a 600 (6:10 - 6:15)
ollar amazon gift card coming my way so (6:13 - 6:18)
that was my very exciting weekend that (6:15 - 6:19)
wasn't actually really that exciting in (6:18 - 6:21)
retrospect but huh what about you guys (6:19 - 6:24)
what's up I have a confession to make i (6:21 - 6:30)
I'm sorry I bought skyrim in 2016 again (6:24 - 6:33)
again cuz it's a it's a game I already (6:30 - 6:35)
own why I was like why is that a (6:33 - 6:39)
question it's a game I already own and (6:35 - 6:43)
the disk is back at my parents house and (6:39 - 6:46)
it was on the 360 and I wanted to play (6:43 - 6:48)
it on the pc and so I just bought it (6:46 - 6:50)
again we'll have expansion because I (6:48 - 6:52)
hadn't played any of the expansions and (6:50 - 6:55)
it hadn't occurred to me that game came (6:52 - 6:58)
out in 2011 five years ago which first (6:55 - 7:01)
of all that's wild seems like that was (6:58 - 7:04)
yesterday and second of all it's it's (7:01 - 7:07)
still really fun and that's all I did (7:04 - 7:10)
last weekend was play a five year old (7:07 - 7:11)
video game like it's not even old enough (7:10 - 7:15)
to be like yeah I busted out banjo (7:11 - 7:18)
kazooie again it was like oh man all the (7:15 - 7:22)
all the nostalgia all the the facebook (7:18 - 7:28)
posts about oh you BuzzFeed's list of 12 (7:22 - 7:31)
games that only 90s kids no number 60 (7:28 - 7:34)
shot you it's banjo kazooie it's (7:31 - 7:36)
not even that like there's no nostalgia (7:34 - 7:40)
it's just I don't know I like walking (7:36 - 7:43)
into caves and then dispatching what's (7:40 - 7:45)
inside and then going to the next (7:43 - 7:48)
identical cave and then crouching and (7:45 - 7:50)
waiting for somebody to turn around and (7:48 - 7:53)
feel everything off their plate is that (7:50 - 7:54)
you got to steal things off people's (7:53 - 7:57)
tables that's one of the things you can (7:54 - 8:00)
do yeah it's a it's it's a (7:57 - 8:03)
table simulator it's like that tabletop (8:00 - 8:06)
simulator except instead of playing (8:03 - 8:08)
board games you just take things off of (8:06 - 8:10)
tables when people aren't looking why (8:08 - 8:15)
why would you know do such a thing why (8:10 - 8:17)
would you play a five-year-old game no (8:15 - 8:19)
my question was why would you not dabble (8:17 - 8:20)
in something new like elder scrolls (8:19 - 8:23)
online the ESO as the kids call it (8:20 - 8:25)
because it's supposed to be like awful (8:23 - 8:29)
isn't it I mean it's it's what I that's (8:25 - 8:32)
also a table clearing game all I've (8:29 - 8:34)
heard is that it's pretty bad it's fine (8:32 - 8:36)
I mean I don't like Elder Scrolls to (8:34 - 8:39)
begin with and when I played it to me it (8:36 - 8:41)
felt like elder scrolls except with all (8:39 - 8:43)
the people running around yes that's the (8:41 - 8:47)
worst part it would I want to share (8:43 - 8:49)
anything with anyone that's true yet (8:47 - 8:52)
well how about you well I'm had one of (8:49 - 8:55)
the worst weekend's of my life or at (8:52 - 8:56)
least one of the worst weekend's of my (8:55 - 8:58)
recent life because I got called into (8:56 - 9:01)
work on saturday and i had to work most (8:58 - 9:04)
of saturday because the internet at the (9:01 - 9:06)
University went down and I had to test (9:04 - 9:08)
all kinds of garbage not like I could (9:06 - 9:11)
actually fix the problem and then Sunday (9:08 - 9:14)
morning and we had another outage and I (9:11 - 9:16)
had to get up early and work on that and (9:14 - 9:18)
figure out to help people figure out (9:16 - 9:20)
what's going on and then Sunday night my (9:18 - 9:23)
one redemption for the weekend was (9:20 - 9:25)
supposed to be watching WrestleMania and (9:23 - 9:29)
and I couldn't because WWE messed up (9:25 - 9:32)
real bad and they're gonna lose one (9:29 - 9:34)
hundred and twenty dollars for me I mean (9:32 - 9:36)
the period they did email you earlier in (9:34 - 9:40)
the week okay I are I am like a modern (9:36 - 9:43)
person I don't use email anymore and (9:40 - 9:47)
besides that laughter fine fine that's (9:43 - 9:49)
great they sent a notification this is (9:47 - 9:53)
2016 you test your app sufficiently (9:49 - 9:56)
especially like if it's on a restricted (9:53 - 9:59)
number of platforms before your biggest (9:56 - 10:03)
event of the year you do not release an (9:59 - 10:04)
update that makes it this so that your (10:03 - 10:07)
loyal customers who have been paying ten (10:04 - 10:09)
dollars a month for an entire year can't (10:07 - 10:12)
get into the freaking app to watch the (10:09 - 10:14)
one thing that they want to see after (10:12 - 10:15)
they're horrible horrible weekend of (10:14 - 10:19)
having to work and being very unhappy (10:15 - 10:21)
yeah I'm not sure you're you're not (10:19 - 10:24)
wrong like obviously we're in an age (10:21 - 10:27)
where if you need to reset your password (10:24 - 10:30)
and you can't because they're doing (10:27 - 10:31)
maintenance or their service or there's (10:30 - 10:34)
too much traffic because I think they (10:31 - 10:36)
had they came out and said there was two (10:34 - 10:38)
million subscribers at that point in (10:36 - 10:41)
time because it was you could sign up (10:38 - 10:43)
for free trial or not I mean that's (10:41 - 10:46)
still broken and you couldn't get access (10:43 - 10:49)
and yeah they emailed you saying like (10:46 - 10:51)
hey make sure you can successfully log (10:49 - 10:54)
in before this weekend because you might (10:51 - 10:56)
not be able to if you don't test ahead (10:54 - 10:59)
of time while they did alert you and I (10:56 - 11:01)
and everyone else there there really is (10:59 - 11:04)
no excuse why as a paying customer you (11:01 - 11:06)
got locked out like i'm not i'm not sure (11:04 - 11:08)
what the technical aspect is i'm just (11:06 - 11:10)
letting i was just stating that they (11:08 - 11:12)
didn't let everyone know via email (11:10 - 11:14)
whether but read honest honestly and (11:12 - 11:19)
truly I get 200 to 300 email messages a (11:14 - 11:22)
day I just don't have time to catch and (11:19 - 11:26)
I'm sorry but WWE literally emails every (11:22 - 11:28)
other day hey we've got new t-shirt (11:26 - 11:30)
designs hey make sure you watch Raw (11:28 - 11:32)
Monday night hey watch make sure you (11:30 - 11:35)
watch a Thursday night you know and I (11:32 - 11:37)
see one email from WWE I'm like it's (11:35 - 11:39)
just gonna be another promotion I'm (11:37 - 11:41)
gonna ignore it right but here's the (11:39 - 11:45)
thing i watch on my ps4 I have the app (11:41 - 11:48)
installed on my ps4 but Sony sends out (11:45 - 11:50)
notifications about all kinds of garbage (11:48 - 11:52)
all the time and I read them because I (11:50 - 11:53)
actually don't get that many (11:52 - 11:56)
notifications on the ps4 and it pops up (11:53 - 11:58)
when I turn on the ps4 it pops up and (11:56 - 11:59)
says we have a message for you and I (11:58 - 12:03)
look at it couldn't the WWE have pushed (11:59 - 12:05)
out a message through the ps4 system I (12:03 - 12:08)
have the WWE app on my phone couldn't (12:05 - 12:10)
they have done a notification through (12:08 - 12:12)
that it's their biggest event of the (12:10 - 12:16)
year oh so angry you know what I do in a (12:12 - 12:19)
situation like this I hit em to pull my (12:16 - 12:23)
world map fast travel to solitude take (12:19 - 12:26)
out the bow and I just take out all my (12:23 - 12:27)
anger (12:26 - 12:31)
on the Eagles that are perpetually (12:27 - 12:34)
flying over solitude I take some hawk (12:31 - 12:35)
feathers I guess they're Hawks because (12:34 - 12:37)
they drop hawk feathers shouldn't notice (12:35 - 12:39)
that you know and I make myself some I (12:37 - 12:41)
think they make like resists fire (12:39 - 12:43)
potions or something you know it really (12:41 - 12:46)
it it's a really call me experience I (12:43 - 12:48)
think you should try it this episode (12:46 - 12:51)
brought to you by Skyrim a five year old (12:48 - 12:55)
game what I did was I ended up watching (12:51 - 12:58)
pokemon XY and z at that car team is (12:55 - 13:00)
probably about her it was real good oh (12:58 - 13:04)
well what did you that would have been a (13:00 - 13:06)
good transition day you said Pokemon (13:04 - 13:08)
right now keep go but I really wanted to (13:06 - 13:10)
ask did you actually end up watching (13:08 - 13:13)
WrestleMania yet no no I'm done I am (13:10 - 13:16)
done I am anybody who wants my WWE (13:13 - 13:18)
t-shirts give me your address I'll put (13:16 - 13:19)
them in the mail to you I am done with (13:18 - 13:22)
WWE canceling my subscription not (13:19 - 13:23)
putting up with any of this garbage (13:22 - 13:26)
anymore you heard at your first breaking (13:23 - 13:30)
news speaking of news got some pokemon (13:26 - 13:31)
news we just got a little bit a little (13:30 - 13:34)
bit of pokemon news we talked last well (13:31 - 13:36)
let's get the let's get the obvious (13:34 - 13:38)
thing out of the way here there was a (13:36 - 13:41)
Pokemon house I don't know what the show (13:38 - 13:42)
is actually called in Japanese but I (13:41 - 13:44)
think in English it translates to (13:42 - 13:46)
Pokemon house I think it's at oak n chi (13:44 - 13:49)
booking G there was rumors and (13:46 - 13:50)
speculation that there was going to be (13:49 - 13:53)
some Pokemon Sun and Moon details (13:50 - 13:57)
revealed if you go back and look at the (13:53 - 14:01)
official statement and I think that was (13:57 - 14:04)
on serebii and some other places by know (14:01 - 14:07)
for sure it was on serebii it stated (14:04 - 14:12)
that it will show first-ever footage on (14:07 - 14:16)
TV and somehow that got translated into (14:12 - 14:19)
other websites as first-ever gameplay (14:16 - 14:21)
footage when going back to the original (14:19 - 14:23)
press release said first-ever footage (14:21 - 14:25)
why did what ended up happening is on (14:23 - 14:29)
Pokemon house they showed the trailer (14:25 - 14:31)
that we have already seen for sun and (14:29 - 14:33)
moon they just showed that again as a (14:31 - 14:36)
commercial in between the breaks of (14:33 - 14:40)
Pokemon house and that was it then they (14:36 - 14:41)
also give us a (14:40 - 14:43)
release window that was more specific (14:41 - 14:45)
than what we had known previously I (14:43 - 14:47)
don't think is it then they like give us (14:45 - 14:51)
a month but they did now nothing else I (14:47 - 14:53)
somebody on the show said there will be (14:51 - 14:55)
more than 10 new Pokemon so that did (14:53 - 14:59)
come out of it yeah I couldn't like the (14:55 - 15:01)
amount of anger that the internet had (14:59 - 15:03)
out this that like all these websites (15:01 - 15:05)
lied to them about game footage and they (15:03 - 15:07)
did lie like know where we did it state (15:05 - 15:08)
game footage like if you go to that (15:07 - 15:10)
original article original press (15:08 - 15:12)
statement whatever you want to call it (15:10 - 15:15)
like it they only said footage and ever (15:12 - 15:17)
the the word game was just put in by (15:15 - 15:19)
other sites to drive traffic and to (15:17 - 15:22)
build excitement that wasn't there so I (15:19 - 15:25)
expected nothing because nothing really (15:22 - 15:28)
comes out of those shows and I got (15:25 - 15:30)
nothing and that was okay for me yeah (15:28 - 15:32)
and I think it's just like do you know (15:30 - 15:34)
well Steve you don't know Travis you may (15:32 - 15:38)
know when you're at the at the bar and (15:34 - 15:39)
you've had a couple of beers and then (15:38 - 15:42)
you have to go to the bathroom and (15:39 - 15:44)
that's called you know the first time (15:42 - 15:46)
you do it it's called breaking the seal (15:44 - 15:47)
and then from that point forward you (15:46 - 15:48)
have to go to the bathroom more (15:47 - 15:51)
frequently um that's what they've done (15:48 - 15:53)
they've broken the seal so now they're (15:51 - 15:54)
gonna have to give us more and more (15:53 - 15:56)
footage as time goes on they can't go (15:54 - 15:59)
back to a time of silence so you (15:56 - 16:01)
wouldn't know about that because he's (15:59 - 16:04)
not 21 yet right yeah well no cuz Steve (16:01 - 16:07)
does not drink Abby I know I'm joking my (16:04 - 16:10)
12 every body cannot handle beer in his (16:07 - 16:13)
life the beer we got some more Wi-Fi (16:10 - 16:18)

results will be announced in May (16:32 - 16:37)
competition is one on one or (16:34 - 16:39)

of each Pokemon into battle legendary (16:40 - 16:46)
and mythical Pokemon cannot be used in (16:44 - 16:48)

sapphire games Pokemon cannot be brought (16:50 - 16:55)

used in this tournament all Pokemon (16:55 - 16:58)
below level 50 and above will automate (16:56 - 17:01)
movie sets of 50 I'll battles will last (16:58 - 17:03)
a maximum of five minutes players will (17:01 - 17:06)
have 30 seconds to decide which Pokemon (17:03 - 17:08)
they want to battle with they will have (17:06 - 17:12)
10 seconds to attack her to switch and (17:08 - 17:14)
you may battle 20 times a day for a (17:12 - 17:19)
total of sixty battles players Pokemon (17:14 - 17:21)
may not hold mega stones focus sash or (17:19 - 17:24)
soul do what do you guys think I think (17:21 - 17:25)
it can be a lot of fun because a lot of (17:24 - 17:28)
people complain that singles is too slow (17:25 - 17:31)
so this is obviously implementing (17:28 - 17:33)
something to make it sped up absolutely (17:31 - 17:36)
I think I'm it did I miss something it (17:33 - 17:39)
sounds like it's a it's a it's like a (17:36 - 17:41)
one-on-one like just one each player (17:39 - 17:45)
brings they bring six pick one yes am i (17:41 - 17:47)
understanding it correctly yeah I've (17:45 - 17:49)
they've had formats like that a lot of (17:47 - 17:51)
the simulators like that's been on (17:49 - 17:55)
showdown in stuff for a while it's weird (17:51 - 17:58)
if you get weird stuff well I mean I (17:55 - 18:00)
guess they're banning focus sash so (17:58 - 18:02)
that's different than I've heard of (18:00 - 18:04)
before but you get sort of weird (18:02 - 18:07)
strategies where stuff that would (18:04 - 18:10)
normally you wouldn't normally see in in (18:07 - 18:14)
just a normal singles match because it's (18:10 - 18:16)
just sort of a weird gimmick that only (18:14 - 18:20)
gets you one KO and then usually your (18:16 - 18:22)
serve left vulnerable when they get a (18:20 - 18:26)
free switchin becomes a lot more usable (18:22 - 18:28)
nothing immediately is coming to mind (18:26 - 18:30)
but I think I'm remembering back a while (18:28 - 18:33)
I think people would do a lot of stuff (18:30 - 18:37)
with like togekiss and serene grace and (18:33 - 18:41)
just bank on flinch chance and just not (18:37 - 18:43)
give the other Pokemon a chance because (18:41 - 18:46)
it's not like you can just switch into a (18:43 - 18:49)
defensive pokemon and and slap a toxic (18:46 - 18:51)
on it or whatever yeah I guess I mean (18:49 - 18:53)
you're looking at their six you have (18:51 - 18:55)
your six I mean you could be in a (18:53 - 18:56)
situation where you pick a water pokemon (18:55 - 18:59)
they picked an electric and not much you (18:56 - 19:01)
can do they're like the water pokemon (18:59 - 19:05)
you picked was Lantern I suppose yes or (19:01 - 19:07)
you were faster and you have a (19:05 - 19:08)
ground-type move (19:07 - 19:12)
or yeah wish cash nice a lot of water (19:08 - 19:15)
grounds do some uh some work with (19:12 - 19:17)
Swampert in this India clearly in this (19:15 - 19:21)
electric-type meta that will does (19:17 - 19:23)
dominated by electric types I mean (19:21 - 19:25)
that's why it's called the flash crash (19:23 - 19:29)
ah speaking of electric types there is a (19:25 - 19:32)
new pokemon type quiz what's your (19:29 - 19:33)
pokemon type you could take a quiz on (19:32 - 19:36)
Pokemon telecom to find out surprisingly (19:33 - 19:38)
you won't be hearing a lot from me cuz (19:36 - 19:42)
I'm gonna take that right now there's a (19:38 - 19:44)
actually quite a bit of questions I want (19:42 - 19:47)
to say there was 12 13 questions if i (19:44 - 19:49)
remember correctly i ended up buying (19:47 - 19:50)
it's gonna be even longer than i thought (19:49 - 19:53)
that i will be talking i ended up (19:50 - 19:55)
getting electric-type as my pokemon type (19:53 - 19:57)
Wow which is I think interesting at one (19:55 - 19:58)
point it does ask you what your like (19:57 - 20:01)
favorite type is i think if i remember (19:58 - 20:04)
right that's okay i get away give away (20:01 - 20:08)
and no I put water maybe it was like a (20:04 - 20:10)
baby I read the question wrong cuz i was (20:08 - 20:12)
doing at my phone in a car wash like (20:10 - 20:14)
real quickly before the car wash n ended (20:12 - 20:17)
but well maybe it was what was your (20:14 - 20:19)
favorite type battle against but i (20:17 - 20:21)
thought it said what was your favorite (20:19 - 20:22)
type and I was like oh here we go water (20:21 - 20:25)
because that's what I wanted but it (20:22 - 20:28)
Italy there's like a zoo bet question (20:25 - 20:32)
that it asks there's a question link to (20:28 - 20:33)
the show that i'm recording this is this (20:32 - 20:36)

they might more easily find the quiz um (20:36 - 20:41)

it did it did it we got a breaking news (23:26 - 23:30)
bulletin I was out I'd say I had a (23:28 - 23:33)
breaking news bulletin hey could you (23:30 - 23:35)
both don't you breaking news bullet (23:33 - 23:37)
over my breaking news bulletin just take (23:35 - 23:43)
the quiz yes okay is that what both of (23:37 - 23:46)
our both of our news bulletins and the (23:43 - 23:50)
word yes I guess we'll find out but yeah (23:46 - 23:52)
I got I got ferry who's surprised by (23:50 - 23:53)
that I don't think ice was it was an (23:52 - 23:55)
option ice is my favorite type but I (23:53 - 23:57)
don't think ice was in there because at (23:55 - 23:58)
the part where I was like if you're a (23:57 - 24:01)
gym leader or what would your type B is (23:58 - 24:04)
was not there so yeah ferry is probably (24:01 - 24:06)
the next best thing did it ask what your (24:04 - 24:07)
favorite type was at one point or am i (24:06 - 24:10)
imagining things no it asked you or a (24:07 - 24:12)
gym leader while Pokemon would you (24:10 - 24:14)
predominantly use oh these different (24:12 - 24:16)
questions when you take it that might (24:14 - 24:18)
have been like oh no no I got this I got (24:16 - 24:19)
the same question cuz I said water cuz (24:18 - 24:21)
that was one of the options well what (24:19 - 24:23)
did you get well there was a reason why (24:21 - 24:25)
i had not taken this quiz before when i (24:23 - 24:27)
saw the answers that other people were (24:25 - 24:31)
posting on the social medias and i ended (24:27 - 24:33)
up as disappointed as i expected to be i (24:31 - 24:39)
got normal type i would assume that ice (24:33 - 24:41)
is one of the options why would it not (24:39 - 24:44)
be there's only like six there's how (24:41 - 24:46)
many 17 pokemon types and there's only (24:44 - 24:50)
like six options for each question yeah (24:46 - 24:52)
but there's enough questions to develop (24:50 - 24:53)
her mutations that would end up with any (24:52 - 24:58)
of the 17 right but i think that i don't (24:53 - 25:00)
think it one of the quizzes that works (24:58 - 25:03)
like that I think it's one of the ones (25:00 - 25:05)
where there's there's six possible and (25:03 - 25:09)
whatever one you get you another yes to (25:05 - 25:12)
pick up in four for all these questions (25:09 - 25:14)
because then I don't have to move my (25:12 - 25:16)
mouse or trackpad all right almost done (25:14 - 25:19)
here this is making for great great (25:16 - 25:22)
podcasting material all right I picked (25:19 - 25:25)
option for for all the questions my type (25:22 - 25:28)
of steel alright i'm doing option six (25:25 - 25:33)
for all the questions and my i'll do (25:28 - 25:36)
option once all the way I'm going to (25:33 - 25:41)
abstain from this not the more make (25:36 - 25:46)
andheri world breaking radio yes why I'm (25:41 - 25:48)
abstaining from this I don't (25:46 - 25:52)
I don't support the falsification of (25:48 - 25:54)
Pokemon type quiz results yes if you (25:52 - 25:57)
vote up you voter fraud see if that's (25:54 - 25:58)

self-esteem to to to keep doing (28:07 - 28:12)

here (29:15 - 29:17)
just found your podcast last week and I (29:15 - 29:19)
started with your podcast about sun and (29:17 - 29:21)
moon I was thinking about the new games (29:19 - 29:24)
and as I was watching organs he wrote (29:21 - 29:27)
origins but we know what it is we know (29:24 - 29:29)
we know what they met yes I was thinking (29:27 - 29:31)
Sun and Moon could be a game where new (29:29 - 29:33)
Pokemon will be introduced as well as (29:31 - 29:36)
bringing more light to the mega stones (29:33 - 29:38)
and mega evolution so far we barely know (29:36 - 29:40)
anything about it and I feel like I feel (29:38 - 29:42)
like it's time to bring a fourth (29:40 - 29:44)
evolution to light and if it doesn't (29:42 - 29:46)
answer Sun and Moon and if it doesn't (29:44 - 29:48)
get answered in sun and moon it would (29:46 - 29:50)
feel like a cop-out what do you think (29:48 - 29:53)
had well mega evolutions a fourth (29:50 - 29:59)
evolution well it isn't it isn't so it's (29:53 - 30:02)
not permanent yes so it all depends on (29:59 - 30:07)
what is is okay bill clinton let me riff (30:02 - 30:13)
on true 80s babies s is so sure um let (30:07 - 30:16)
me um just follow through on that in my (30:13 - 30:18)
watching of pokemon XY and z which I do (30:16 - 30:20)
highly recommend that every pokemon fan (30:18 - 30:23)
watch that cartoon and not wait for it (30:20 - 30:25)
to get to Netflix because it's good now (30:23 - 30:28)
in the most recent episode they actually (30:25 - 30:30)
redid the first reveal of ash greninja (30:28 - 30:35)
and what it was was not like in the (30:30 - 30:39)
Pokemon burst comics where the pokemon (30:35 - 30:41)
trainer actually merges with a Pokemon (30:39 - 30:44)
and they become one unified being um ash (30:41 - 30:47)
and greninja stayed separate but the (30:44 - 30:52)
greninja kind of did like the burst in (30:47 - 30:55)
token tournament did i pronounce it (30:52 - 30:58)
correctly this time Pocan um where it (30:55 - 31:01)
just becomes more powerful it did have (30:58 - 31:03)
some appearance changes and there was (31:01 - 31:05)
just that moment where it was like a (31:03 - 31:09)
union of the fighting spirit of ash and (31:05 - 31:10)
the greninja that caused it to happen (31:09 - 31:13)
but they did remain as separate beings (31:10 - 31:15)
they did not merge together so all of (31:13 - 31:18)
your Digimon fears can be set aside and (31:15 - 31:21)
put your last um so I do think that (31:18 - 31:23)
they're going to be in investigating the (31:21 - 31:27)
the burst concept of enhancing your (31:23 - 31:29)
pokémon's power (31:27 - 31:31)
um possibly not in the way of an (31:29 - 31:34)
evolution or fourth evolution but just (31:31 - 31:37)
threw a burst event um the nice thing is (31:34 - 31:39)
I think that that's going to be able to (31:37 - 31:42)
apply to all Pokemon as opposed to them (31:39 - 31:43)
having to determine which pokemons get (31:42 - 31:47)
which did I say pokemons Wow which (31:43 - 31:52)
Pokemon get mega suited from the cast I (31:47 - 31:54)
just I don't like sounding ignorant I (31:52 - 31:56)
gotta I gotta hide my ignorance I mean (31:54 - 32:02)
I'm all for being wrong the I don't okay (31:56 - 32:04)
I don't see them ever tackling the (32:02 - 32:07)
fourth evolution at this point I think (32:04 - 32:13)
that with mega evolution you you get (32:07 - 32:17)
that benefit of what a quote-unquote (32:13 - 32:20)
fourth evolution would look like without (32:17 - 32:23)
bogging down the pokédex I don't know (32:20 - 32:25)
why I bet mega be drills my example for (32:23 - 32:27)
everything but if you look at mega (32:25 - 32:30)
Beedrill he's clearly way cooler has a (32:27 - 32:33)
different ability bigger everything (32:30 - 32:35)
everything in evolution of Beedrill (32:33 - 32:39)
would have but you also but you get the (32:35 - 32:42)
benefits of okay that's eight at the end (32:39 - 32:44)
of the day he still be drill so you're (32:42 - 32:45)
not getting another pokedex ember and (32:44 - 32:48)
also because he's not considered of (32:45 - 32:51)
fourth evolution we don't have to come (32:48 - 32:54)
up with another bunny named to stick (32:51 - 32:56)
onto that we just put the word mega (32:54 - 32:59)
before it and people are satisfied and I (32:56 - 33:03)
think that that thought process or that (32:59 - 33:07)
mechanic that Pokemon designed is (33:03 - 33:10)
actually really clever and how many mega (33:07 - 33:13)
Pokemon do we have 60 70 maybe maybe (33:10 - 33:15)
less maybe I'm exaggerating that number (33:13 - 33:18)
but that's six years 70 less Pokemon in (33:15 - 33:21)
the pokédex that's 60 and 70 less names (33:18 - 33:23)
that everyone has to remember if Pokemon (33:21 - 33:25)
keeps growing which obviously what Sun (33:23 - 33:26)
and Moon we're going to get new Pokemon (33:25 - 33:30)
we're at we're going to go over 723 or (33:26 - 33:32)
whatever we're at right now and that's (33:30 - 33:34)
you know sixty or seven and we have to (33:32 - 33:35)
remember plus the mega evolutions (33:34 - 33:37)
they're going to stick on so I I feel (33:35 - 33:40)
like in the long run what they did now (33:37 - 33:42)
is going to pay off (33:40 - 33:44)
I do not feel like it's a cop-out to (33:42 - 33:48)
bring politics up again in the same (33:44 - 33:51)
episode but I'm realizing that (33:48 - 33:54)
indistinct contrast to my real life (33:51 - 33:56)
politics I'm like a Pokemon hyper (33:54 - 34:01)
conservative I am like a like Ted Cruz's (33:56 - 34:04)
grandfather when it comes to Pokemon I'm (34:01 - 34:07)
like new things no I don't want any of (34:04 - 34:10)
that it's perfect how it is in fact it (34:07 - 34:13)
we should revert to the way it was a (34:10 - 34:18)
generation ago everything was fine but (34:13 - 34:22)
everything was fine until Cynthia got (34:18 - 34:25)
enough office just change in the book (34:22 - 34:27)
are you Ted Cruz's grandfather was (34:25 - 34:29)
actually a hippie yeah I mean I'm all (34:27 - 34:34)
for new stuff in Pokemon I know Travis (34:29 - 34:35)
was one of the people very vocal about (34:34 - 34:38)
not wanting a new type and then who took (34:35 - 34:40)
the Pokemon quiz and got very tight (34:38 - 34:42)
because secretly have fairies are cute (34:40 - 34:44)
fairies are cute very type Ares wear (34:42 - 34:47)
boots I don't like that they added a new (34:44 - 34:50)
type but fairies are adorable Michelle (34:47 - 34:52)
wrightson from Canada she writes hey (34:50 - 34:54)
Steve Travis will and anyone else that (34:52 - 34:57)
might be one on the podcast asking to (34:54 - 35:00)
say hahaha joke about Logan sick burn (34:57 - 35:04)
Logan a heart I'm excited for pokmon go (35:00 - 35:06)
although I'm not trying to give my hope (35:04 - 35:08)
get my host hopes up yeah you want to (35:06 - 35:13)
give them another robbery just (35:08 - 35:15)
destroying the English language tonight (35:13 - 35:17)
Mike Witt well that's every day of my (35:15 - 35:20)
life my question is what do you think (35:17 - 35:22)
will be brought through in in-app (35:20 - 35:25)
purchases I'm hoping pokeballs won't (35:22 - 35:26)
cost real money although there's a good (35:25 - 35:29)
chance they will be thanks for taking (35:26 - 35:31)
the time to read this question love love (35:29 - 35:33)
is all caps love the podcast so much (35:31 - 35:37)
have a fabulous day smiley face ! in app (35:33 - 35:39)
purchases are going to be much like me (35:37 - 35:42)
tomo and it's going to be cute outfits (35:39 - 35:45)
for your trainer to wear your trainer (35:42 - 35:49)
can be a hot dog I I don't think they're (35:45 - 35:50)
gonna go that far with it i I II (35:49 - 35:53)
wouldn't be surprised if they give you (35:50 - 35:54)
like five free pokeballs a day or (35:53 - 35:56)
something like that and then (35:54 - 35:58)
if you need more you want more you have (35:56 - 36:01)
to buy those right and if I think that's (35:58 - 36:06)
I can see it going two ways I could see (36:01 - 36:08)
it like that sort of akin to the other (36:06 - 36:10)
free-to-play games that have been (36:08 - 36:14)
Pokemon related we're like Pokemon (36:10 - 36:17)
shuffle where you have a certain amount (36:14 - 36:19)
that you can play for free and then you (36:17 - 36:23)
pay to continue and they would work that (36:19 - 36:25)
in by giving you a certain number of (36:23 - 36:29)
pokeballs per day or at the other way I (36:25 - 36:32)
could see it going is you can use normal (36:29 - 36:36)
pokeballs for free and excuse me have a (36:32 - 36:39)
smaller chance of catching the Pokemon (36:36 - 36:42)
you find but if you want to guarantee a (36:39 - 36:45)
catch you have to buy a master ball or (36:42 - 36:46)
something like that since we've already (36:45 - 36:49)
seen that they have pokeballs great (36:46 - 36:52)
balls ultra balls and master balls in (36:49 - 36:53)
the game from the little footage we've (36:52 - 36:56)
seen although i doubt i mean i think (36:53 - 37:00)
that's a more optimistic gas because (36:56 - 37:03)
that one it would be completely fun (37:00 - 37:06)
feasible to play that version of the (37:03 - 37:08)
game free to play for as long as you (37:06 - 37:11)
wanted and more likely they would want (37:08 - 37:13)
to push the version where if you only (37:11 - 37:16)
play too casually and only needed the (37:13 - 37:17)
five pokeballs to get your fill then (37:16 - 37:22)
none more power to you but i think that (37:17 - 37:24)
that's the route they would go because (37:22 - 37:25)
most players are probably one more than (37:24 - 37:29)
five so how does the parent lemongrass (37:25 - 37:32)
actually handle money and how do they (37:29 - 37:36)
make money on ingress i'm not sure how (37:32 - 37:39)
ingress makes money I didn't enjoy the (37:36 - 37:43)
game enough to stick with it mmm because (37:39 - 37:46)
they did say like you that the locations (37:43 - 37:51)
that are more popular or like you know (37:46 - 37:53)
monuments and things like that places (37:51 - 37:55)
are more from visited will have a larger (37:53 - 37:58)
collection of items that you'll be able (37:55 - 38:01)
to obtain from those locations so I (37:58 - 38:03)
there's a possibility that there may (38:01 - 38:06)
actually be no in-game transaction and (38:03 - 38:07)
what they're really selling is your (38:06 - 38:08)
location (38:07 - 38:10)
data and their frequent frequency that (38:08 - 38:13)
you know certain locations oh well come (38:10 - 38:15)
on we all know that adage that if you're (38:13 - 38:17)
not paying for something than the thing (38:15 - 38:20)
that's being sold is you so I know I (38:17 - 38:23)
don't care what I live in Washington DC (38:20 - 38:25)
I think they want student estimate that (38:23 - 38:28)
like the citizens of Washington DC are (38:25 - 38:30)
photographed 260 something times a day (38:28 - 38:33)
everyone the government knows where I am (38:30 - 38:37)
definitely I literally have homeland (38:33 - 38:40)
security headquarters in my backyard I'm (38:37 - 38:42)
sure everything I do with my apartment (38:40 - 38:44)
is videoed and recorded anyways I don't (38:42 - 38:47)
care whatever come after me come at me (38:44 - 38:50)
bro you know where I am we'll live in (38:47 - 38:52)
the dream I just have been a (38:50 - 38:54)
surveillance state and I've grown to (38:52 - 38:57)
accept it I I will probably get more (38:54 - 39:00)
information a Pokemon go sooner rather (38:57 - 39:02)
than later here but I would assume that (39:00 - 39:06)
the the master ball will be a very (39:02 - 39:09)
pricey item on the list mmm Jake rights (39:06 - 39:13)
in here he says hello IGN's podcast (39:09 - 39:17)
games cube came sku's game scoop does a (39:13 - 39:20)
20 question segment with games I was (39:17 - 39:21)
thinking that maybe you guys could do (39:20 - 39:23)
that segment with like pokemon i think (39:21 - 39:25)
it would be fun to listen to thanks love (39:23 - 39:28)
the show Jake a revitalization of (39:25 - 39:33)
extreme speed yeah maybe extremes at nay (39:28 - 39:34)
doesn't obviously say but I don't know (39:33 - 39:36)
if extreme speed fits that mold I (39:34 - 39:39)
haven't listened to games game scoop in (39:36 - 39:42)
a long time it man that used to be one (39:39 - 39:44)
of the I've cast I used to love to (39:42 - 39:50)
listen to only 2000s babies yeah I mean (39:44 - 39:53)
I'm definitely not opposed to doing new (39:50 - 39:55)
segment so I think we fall into this (39:53 - 39:59)
this crutch of a lot of people like the (39:55 - 40:00)
off-topic banner at the beginning of the (39:59 - 40:03)
episode so and and I personally enjoy (40:00 - 40:05)
the off-topic banter I like getting that (40:03 - 40:07)
out of my system I like you know not (40:05 - 40:09)
everything to be so serious I think it's (40:07 - 40:11)
something that a unique that our show (40:09 - 40:13)
does compared to the other Pokemon (40:11 - 40:15)
podcasts that are out there and they (40:13 - 40:19)
come and go quite frequently but (40:15 - 40:23)
as I don't I don't think I hope you're (40:19 - 40:25)
not referring to like I like a top five (40:23 - 40:29)
like what are our top five fairy pokemon (40:25 - 40:30)
or something cuz I don't know how much (40:29 - 40:34)
interest in us making up a you know I (40:30 - 40:36)
don't think that's what the pinion base (40:34 - 40:39)
list would be yeah I mean forbid that we (40:36 - 40:42)
do like a Kalos ten of the ten best (40:39 - 40:44)
pokemon yellow so what I said that would (40:42 - 40:48)
be at a staffy there will first there's (40:44 - 40:50)
a lot of people who voted in that not (40:48 - 40:53)
only editors but the community there was (40:50 - 40:55)
art to go with there was exclusive are (40:53 - 40:57)
to go with that there was move sets a (40:55 - 40:59)
lot that's different than us sitting (40:57 - 41:02)
down before the show cuz gosh forbid we (40:59 - 41:03)
actually talk about what the show is (41:02 - 41:06)
going to be and they like all right we (41:03 - 41:08)
need a top five list for grass pokémon (41:06 - 41:11)
what do you think Rico I don't think (41:08 - 41:12)
that's I don't think that's at all what (41:11 - 41:15)
the person writing that emo was (41:12 - 41:17)
suggesting i think it's a more akin to (41:15 - 41:19)
what we used to do with extreme speed (41:17 - 41:20)
although we sort of retired that segment (41:19 - 41:24)
because we found it to not be very (41:20 - 41:27)
interesting unless you had a new gaston (41:24 - 41:30)
and yet at the same time it felt strange (41:27 - 41:34)
to you say hey person we've hardly (41:30 - 41:36)
talked to you before I'm going to (41:34 - 41:39)
bombard you with questions now yeah I'm (41:36 - 41:42)
20 questions is a game where like one (41:39 - 41:44)
person thinks of something and then the (41:42 - 41:46)
other people can ask up to 20 questions (41:44 - 41:48)
but they can only be yes or no questions (41:46 - 41:51)
and then they have to at the end guess (41:48 - 41:53)
what the original person was thinking of (41:51 - 41:56)
oh we're talking about like that like (41:53 - 41:58)
the game 20 questions 20 questions yeah (41:56 - 42:01)
that's fun those were the words that (41:58 - 42:04)
were used in the letter that's fair it's (42:01 - 42:06)
like I'm thinking of a Pokemon can you (42:04 - 42:08)
guys guess what pokemon I'm thinking of (42:06 - 42:12)
and then Travis says squishy and i said (42:08 - 42:16)
yes i don't i don't know how i mean i'd (42:12 - 42:18)
i would have to listen to an episode of (42:16 - 42:21)
game scoop to see what like what exactly (42:18 - 42:23)
he's referring to us you're right now oh (42:21 - 42:26)
I was gonna say listeners you know what (42:23 - 42:27)
Steve is willing to put himself through (42:26 - 42:30)
for you he'll listen to an episode of (42:27 - 42:32)
game scoop (42:30 - 42:33)
like that you're like pitching that as a (42:32 - 42:36)
as in like it's torture for that podcast (42:33 - 42:39)
is as good as it was when I did listen (42:36 - 42:42)
to it no you're mistaken because you're (42:39 - 42:44)
thinking of a podcast that's been (42:42 - 42:46)
discontinued it's actually games coop (42:44 - 42:49)
where chickens talk about games that (42:46 - 42:51)
sounds by kind of show sounds better (42:49 - 42:54)
than this show I'll tell you that now (42:51 - 42:56)
Robert P rights in hello SBJ and (42:54 - 42:58)
everyone else I'm one of your biggest (42:56 - 42:59)
fans it's great to listen to you guys (42:58 - 43:01)
talk about Pokemon other games first (42:59 - 43:03)
question is I would love a new type (43:01 - 43:05)
because I've been playing the same types (43:03 - 43:08)
for over 10 years now well I suppose (43:05 - 43:11)
besides fairy and number two this is (43:08 - 43:14)
full circle Travis Elder Scrolls aren't (43:11 - 43:19)
mm mm Oh based like Skyrim and a baby (43:14 - 43:21)
amar they are awesome you should try one (43:19 - 43:23)
of them sometimes see you soon Robert I (43:21 - 43:27)
mean I'm not a fan of I've played both (43:23 - 43:29)
oblivion and Skyrim and i did not enjoy (43:27 - 43:32)
either of them but i like that i would (43:29 - 43:34)
rather play fallout which is very (43:32 - 43:35)
similar just set in a different universe (43:34 - 43:39)
and i enjoy fallout isn't oblivion 10 (43:35 - 43:42)
years old now yes that's cool isn't (43:39 - 43:47)
oblivion based on the D&D rule sets no I (43:42 - 43:50)
wasn't game that's based on the D&D rule (43:47 - 43:56)
sets that is um shoot that's um now it's (43:50 - 43:58)
number one you never neverwinter nights (43:56 - 44:05)
neverwinter nights ya asses um strength (43:58 - 44:09)
intelligence wisdom or intelligent I (44:05 - 44:11)
think there's two I think its strength (44:09 - 44:13)
intelligence wisdom I think it's almost (44:11 - 44:16)
like the D&D stats but they also add (44:13 - 44:20)
luck and I don't think that there's sure (44:16 - 44:22)
I forget that there's weird stats in (44:20 - 44:25)
Oblivion and the previous Elder Scrolls (44:22 - 44:27)
games with on Skyrim gets rid of those (44:25 - 44:30)
for simplicity's sake and I know what I (44:27 - 44:32)
like and I don't like and it's Elder (44:30 - 44:34)
Scrolls does not fall under the list of (44:32 - 44:37)

over to me with that being said let's (45:00 - 45:08)
jump into our pokemon of the week and (45:03 - 45:11)
this week spoke amount of the week just (45:08 - 45:14)
to celebrate the digital distribution is (45:11 - 45:19)
jirachi and rachi is the steel psychic (45:14 - 45:23)
mythical pokemon we don't ah two things (45:19 - 45:27)
first thing is i myself need to get (45:23 - 45:28)
better at separating mythical and (45:27 - 45:32)
legendary pokemon since we've now hit (45:28 - 45:36)
that direction of Rocky's mythical and I (45:32 - 45:39)
think zapdos Articuno Moltres or (45:36 - 45:42)
legendary and yes mythical czar done (45:39 - 45:44)
through distributions only legendaries (45:42 - 45:47)
are can be caught in game is that is (45:44 - 45:49)
that the like a hundred percent defining (45:47 - 45:52)
factor that's the will anderson hundred (45:49 - 45:53)
percent to find a guy actor and if you (45:52 - 45:54)
need anything more than that you're not (45:53 - 45:58)
my friend anymore i see so dried she is (45:54 - 46:01)
the wish pokémon you can get him him or (45:58 - 46:04)
her or now it yeah cuz it is genderless (46:01 - 46:08)
it's correct it is not known to evolve (46:04 - 46:11)
it to have any other pokemon there's not (46:08 - 46:15)
a really good biology about it besides a (46:11 - 46:17)
just describing what jirachi everyone (46:15 - 46:18)
knows her truck she looks like it has a (46:17 - 46:20)
giant star on its head as a creepy eye (46:18 - 46:21)
on its stomach that is actually really (46:20 - 46:25)
cool and it's like a cute flying star (46:21 - 46:28)
Travis will have a move set for it I was (46:25 - 46:29)
going to say I think the concept is (46:28 - 46:33)
based on like some Japanese seasons not (46:29 - 46:35)
only one of shooting stars but the (46:33 - 46:38)
little tags that hang like it has the (46:35 - 46:40)
three little tags that hang off of it oh (46:38 - 46:42)
that's a Japanese custom of writing your (46:40 - 46:44)
wish on to a piece of paper and then (46:42 - 46:46)
sticking it to a like a certain temple (46:44 - 46:50)
area to have your like witches for the (46:46 - 46:52)
new year or whatever I make sense to (46:50 - 46:53)
come true (46:52 - 46:55)
I let's just remember that wishes don't (46:53 - 46:58)
ever come true that's great that's (46:55 - 47:02)
awesome um I have no way to transition (46:58 - 47:06)
from that darkness so let's just jirachi (47:02 - 47:12)
wish maker that that never got hmm well (47:06 - 47:14)
we're here now and we're talking about (47:12 - 47:18)
Jirachi Jirachi is cool because it's one (47:14 - 47:20)
of those pokemon that are in the (47:18 - 47:24)
category of mu and sal abhi and manaphy (47:20 - 47:28)
and Victini and what ones am I missing I (47:24 - 47:31)
think those shaymin Shaymin yep of (47:28 - 47:36)
Pokemon that have 100's all the way down (47:31 - 47:39)
turtles all the way down on their base (47:36 - 47:41)
stats so that's 100 HP 100 attack (47:39 - 47:43)
defense special tax special defense in (47:41 - 47:45)
speed these pokemon i find really fun to (47:43 - 47:48)
build form because you've got the option (47:45 - 47:51)
to go for an offensive sad or a (47:48 - 47:54)
defensive set and you're not too (47:51 - 47:57)
punished for going with either because (47:54 - 48:01)
100 is a pretty decent stat and these (47:57 - 48:03)
pokemon also tends you have good move (48:01 - 48:07)
pools as is the case with jirachi and (48:03 - 48:10)
Jirachi in addition to that has some (48:07 - 48:12)
pretty great typing in psychic and steel (48:10 - 48:14)
and even better than that a really cool (48:12 - 48:17)
ability and serene grace which doubles (48:14 - 48:21)
the chance of secondary effects to (48:17 - 48:26)
trigger on moose that's things like a (48:21 - 48:27)
percent chance to burn or something like (48:26 - 48:30)
that any any time a move has a something (48:27 - 48:33)
percent chance to do something well (48:30 - 48:36)
that's not true most move because that's (48:33 - 48:42)
but yeah so the moves in the game have (48:36 - 48:45)
coded in them things as primary effects (48:42 - 48:47)
and secondary effects and usually if (48:45 - 48:48)
it's a thing that has a chance to occur (48:47 - 48:50)
it's coated in as a secondary effect and (48:48 - 48:52)
so read grace will double the chance for (48:50 - 48:56)
that to happen so we could build a (48:52 - 48:58)
defensive set and that would be (48:56 - 49:02)
something around toxic and wish but I (48:58 - 49:03)
think it's more fun to do a more (49:02 - 49:06)
offensive set built around trying to (49:03 - 49:08)
flinch your opponent over and over again (49:06 - 49:11)
because we're all awful human beings and (49:08 - 49:13)
we like to frustrate our opponents (49:11 - 49:15)
ceaselessly the best way to do that is (49:13 - 49:20)
to use Ironhead a note about flinch is (49:15 - 49:24)
that it only works if you attack fur is (49:20 - 49:25)
that tres am I remembering that right (49:24 - 49:28)
which only works if you're the if you (49:25 - 49:30)
attack first so we're going to want to (49:28 - 49:32)
make sure you're fast as possible we're (49:30 - 49:35)
going to give you a choice scarf a jolly (49:32 - 49:39)
nature and then v's are going to be 252 (49:35 - 49:41)
and attack and speed and you can throw (49:39 - 49:44)
that additional for an HP well I mean a (49:41 - 49:45)
quick clot would work in that (49:44 - 49:53)
circumstance to iron hat is going to be (49:45 - 49:55)
your main move there you're going to the (49:53 - 49:58)
most as it's got on its own a thirty (49:55 - 49:59)
percent chance to flinch which is (49:58 - 50:01)
already ridiculous add on to that that (49:59 - 50:04)
the the base power isn't too bad either (50:01 - 50:10)
at maybe that's correct at eighty-four (50:04 - 50:13)
percent accuracy means means that iron (50:10 - 50:16)
head is pretty great however you don't (50:13 - 50:18)
always want to be using a steel-type (50:16 - 50:19)
move in case you're up against something (50:18 - 50:22)
that resists it so for a little coverage (50:19 - 50:24)
that still allows you to flinch your (50:22 - 50:26)
opponent I'm going to recommend this I'm (50:24 - 50:29)
head but a lot of people run a heart (50:26 - 50:31)
stamp over some head but because heart (50:29 - 50:35)
stamp has higher accuracy and a higher (50:31 - 50:37)
chance to flinch (50:35 - 50:41)
but I think that if you're by the way I (50:37 - 50:42)
see it if you're running a choice scarf (50:41 - 50:45)
and we are you don't want to be locked (50:42 - 50:48)
into a move and I would rather be locked (50:45 - 50:53)
into a move that has a higher base power (50:48 - 50:57)
in this instance because I feel like (50:53 - 50:58)
it's it's easier for your opponent to (50:57 - 51:01)
just switch into something that resists (50:58 - 51:03)
heart stamp and you can just take as (51:01 - 51:05)
many hard stamps as it takes until you (51:03 - 51:07)
that your opponent doesn't flinch and (51:05 - 51:10)
then you respond in in tune so that (51:07 - 51:12)
would basically forced you to switch out (51:10 - 51:15)
whereas if you rands and headbutt sure (51:12 - 51:17)
you might miss one out of ten times and (51:15 - 51:20)
you're less likely to flinch with it (51:17 - 51:22)
you're at least dealing enough damage (51:20 - 51:24)
that you don't feel like it's a waste of (51:22 - 51:26)
a move to lock yourself into I guess (51:24 - 51:27)
it's personal preference but that's (51:26 - 51:30)
where I lean u-turns great just because (51:27 - 51:32)
it allows you to run a choice scarf (51:30 - 51:35)
Pokemon and not feel like your options (51:32 - 51:37)
are limited because you can you turn out (51:35 - 51:41)
and if they switch you get a very cool (51:37 - 51:43)
advantage there because you can pick a (51:41 - 51:46)
Pokemon that counters it well and then (51:43 - 51:47)
finally healing wish is a really cool (51:46 - 51:51)
move as if for some reason you end up (51:47 - 51:53)
switching out when josh is low on HP (51:51 - 51:56)
it's getting to the end of the end of (51:53 - 51:58)
the match and it's and you get a free (51:56 - 52:00)
switching with jirachi but it's not (51:58 - 52:02)
really going to be able to do anything (52:00 - 52:04)
against your opponent's pokemon what you (52:02 - 52:06)
can do is just use healing wish that's a (52:04 - 52:10)
move that Kos jirachi and heels another (52:06 - 52:14)
Pokemon as long as it's not ko'd fully (52:10 - 52:16)
removing all status effects as well so (52:14 - 52:18)
you could make jirachi which might be (52:16 - 52:20)
useless in some circumstances where (52:18 - 52:23)
everything resists it or for whatever (52:20 - 52:26)
reason the opponent has things that are (52:23 - 52:28)
very susceptible to the flinching (52:26 - 52:30)
strategy you can just use healing wish (52:28 - 52:33)
and bring back a Pokemon that is more (52:30 - 52:35)
useful but doesn't have much health to (52:33 - 52:38)
being very useful so that's our set I (52:35 - 52:40)
think I went over all of it it's pretty (52:38 - 52:42)
close to things a lot of people run for (52:40 - 52:45)
jirachi but with that personal (52:42 - 52:47)
preference of (52:45 - 52:51)
done had but over heart stamp in there (52:47 - 52:54)
too so jirachi is fun and do a lot of (52:51 - 52:57)
cool things with it I got bit of trivia (52:54 - 52:59)
here for jirachi it is the lightest (52:57 - 53:01)
steel type pokémon weighing only 2.4 (52:59 - 53:04)
American pounds jirachi was the first (53:01 - 53:06)
pope his life Pokemon to be distributed (53:04 - 53:09)
via the nintendo Wi-Fi connection (53:06 - 53:11)
previously only event really yeah only (53:09 - 53:14)
event items needed to obtain Pokemon (53:11 - 53:16)
that had been distributed during Wi-Fi (53:14 - 53:17)
so you needed like an item in the game (53:16 - 53:20)
oh I think I actually participate in (53:17 - 53:23)
that desert distribution you see a fat (53:20 - 53:26)
jirachi that special special jirachi and (53:23 - 53:29)
some cartridge someone yeah you don't (53:26 - 53:31)
happen Pokemon bank where it can be kept (53:29 - 53:32)
safe forever I don't I don't have (53:31 - 53:36)
pokemon bank yeah five dollars a year (53:32 - 53:42)
Travis yeah I know I i deduct well I (53:36 - 53:45)
don't really get a lot of enjoyment out (53:42 - 53:49)
of playing the games with pokemon I (53:45 - 53:51)
caught in previous games I like the (53:49 - 53:53)
experience of starting from scratch even (53:51 - 53:56)
to the point of getting a good set of (53:53 - 53:59)
Pokemon for breeding I like doing that (53:56 - 54:02)
from scratch too when I you know and (53:59 - 54:03)
it's only like every other generation (54:02 - 54:05)
that I really feel like oh I'm gonna get (54:03 - 54:07)
into EV training this generation or (54:05 - 54:11)
breeding but um you you better know our (54:07 - 54:12)
Ted Cruz's grandfather you're like oh (54:11 - 54:15)
back in my day we didn't have these (54:12 - 54:18)
carryover Pokemon from the pokemon bank (54:15 - 54:20)
we had to go out in the field and catch (54:18 - 54:23)
all-new Pokemon every time we wanted to (54:20 - 54:26)
have a Pokemon party pull us up by our (54:23 - 54:29)
oh there's no pokemon that sounds like (54:26 - 54:31)
bootstraps that I can make a pun out of (54:29 - 54:35)
I'm sure there is use I think of it for (54:31 - 54:39)
soup exactly that's Russia is the only (54:35 - 54:42)
generation through Pokemon that cannot (54:39 - 54:45)
be obtained in any Hoenn based games (54:42 - 54:49)
without an event cool yeah today I (54:45 - 54:51)
jirachi is the only generation three (54:49 - 54:54)
legendary / mythical Pokemon that is not (54:51 - 54:57)
featured in any of the pokemon ranger (54:54 - 55:00)
games wow that's a loss for pokemon (54:57 - 55:01)
ranger (55:00 - 55:05)
I'll make the cut although George (55:01 - 55:08)
jirachi is genderless in the main games (55:05 - 55:12)
it is referred to as a male in Pokemon (55:08 - 55:16)
super mystery dungeon oh so boepd of (55:12 - 55:18)
jirachi wants to be a mail drop she can (55:16 - 55:22)
be a male I agree settle down super (55:18 - 55:23)
mystery dungeon the game that Travis (55:22 - 55:26)
bought and employ and anyways Chen you (55:23 - 55:28)
got me except that was came from the (55:26 - 55:32)
stone ages genders out of date despite (55:28 - 55:34)
being the despite being legitimately (55:32 - 55:37)
legitimately obtainable in earlier games (55:34 - 55:40)
Chinese jirachi were previously locked (55:37 - 55:43)
out of generation sixes Wi-Fi feature (55:40 - 55:46)
prior and update this makes jirachi the (55:43 - 55:49)
only pokemon to undergo this kind of (55:46 - 55:53)
issue you cannot transfer tiny jirachi (55:49 - 55:57)
'he's via the Wi-Fi it was it so if I'm (55:53 - 56:00)
understanding correctly there was some (55:57 - 56:03)
distribution where you could get a shiny (56:00 - 56:07)
jirachi yeah I freaked sense forgot (56:03 - 56:10)
about that distribution and said oh yeah (56:07 - 56:12)
there's no way you could get a shiny (56:10 - 56:14)
jirachi and said if you get if you hack (56:12 - 56:16)
yourself a shiny jirachi you can't trade (56:14 - 56:18)
it but they forgot that people have it (56:16 - 56:19)
legitimately am i understanding that (56:18 - 56:22)
correctly yeah are correct hey let's (56:19 - 56:25)
awesome think that was a Korean giveaway (56:22 - 56:29)
maybe it'd be interesting not to get off (56:25 - 56:32)
topic if there were there were pokemon (56:29 - 56:36)
that could only be trade traded locally (56:32 - 56:39)
I know that would be interesting like (56:36 - 56:42)
people were probably cringing at that (56:39 - 56:43)
the audio of like why would you ever (56:42 - 56:48)
want or suggest that but what pokemon (56:43 - 56:50)
already has a problem of like I'll just (56:48 - 56:52)
orangey it I'll just gameshark it I'll (56:50 - 56:56)
just have whatever kind of hack you can (56:52 - 57:01)
do and it destroys the Pokemon economy (56:56 - 57:03)
if you believe in that or whatever but (57:01 - 57:08)
like I thought the viv vivillon vivillon (57:03 - 57:13)
vivillon I don't know yes vivio like the (57:08 - 57:14)
fact that you could only get the (57:13 - 57:17)
patterns and different regions was (57:14 - 57:21)
really cool me too and like when you (57:17 - 57:24)
have to trade a hunter or a Kadabra to (57:21 - 57:28)
evolve like that's really cool yeah so (57:24 - 57:30)
it's just like another like it's hard (57:28 - 57:34)
for a Pokemon to be rare when somebody (57:30 - 57:37)
could just hack 30 of them and then just (57:34 - 57:39)
put them up on the trading the BTS or (57:37 - 57:43)
whatever and just hand them out what if (57:39 - 57:46)
this is going against my Pokemon ultra (57:43 - 57:54)
conservatism ah what if and I I don't (57:46 - 57:55)
think this would actually work out but (57:54 - 57:58)
what if they made it so that instead of (57:55 - 58:01)
using and this also gets into wills (57:58 - 58:04)
acceptance of the surveillance state in (58:01 - 58:07)
which he lives instead of using a (58:04 - 58:09)
combination of your trainer named all of (58:07 - 58:12)
that stuff and then the time and date to (58:09 - 58:14)
determine the random elements of a (58:12 - 58:17)
Pokemon to determine its Ivy's when you (58:14 - 58:18)
encounter in the wild or when you hatch (58:17 - 58:21)
it what if they used your geographic (58:18 - 58:23)
location as the seed for the randomness (58:21 - 58:26)
so if you wanted to orangey a pokemon (58:23 - 58:29)
it's not that you would have to like set (58:26 - 58:32)
your clock timer to a certain thing you (58:29 - 58:34)
would have to get on a plane and go to (58:32 - 58:37)
the exact barren wasteland in the middle (58:34 - 58:41)
of Nebraska and then Hatcher get your (58:37 - 58:43)
gibble so that you could get the perfect (58:41 - 58:46)
Garchomp I think that solves all of our (58:43 - 58:49)
problems I mean this is what who's with (58:46 - 58:54)
me it's me but if you look at like (58:49 - 58:59)
Pokemon shuffle like you have the (58:54 - 59:01)
obvious thing that it's doing which is (58:59 - 59:04)
authenticating before you walk in (59:01 - 59:07)
connecting to the internet and so when (59:04 - 59:10)
you catch pokemon there you know that (59:07 - 59:12)
you've caught them and you didn't obtain (59:10 - 59:14)
them in any other way besides the way (59:12 - 59:16)
that you did to earn them and so if (59:14 - 59:17)
they're running a promotion we're like (59:16 - 59:20)
farfetch is only available this week and (59:17 - 59:22)
if you don't catch farfetch in this week (59:20 - 59:25)
because you you're just bad up shuffle (59:22 - 59:26)
because farfetch is pretty easy to catch (59:25 - 59:29)
you have to wait till he comes (59:26 - 59:34)
and that makes you a perfect just being (59:29 - 59:35)
an example that makes you excited that (59:34 - 59:37)
like oh my god fire freshers coming back (59:35 - 59:40)
this week like now I can get them or in (59:37 - 59:42)
retro only like the other way is like oh (59:40 - 59:44)
my god this event ends in two days and I (59:42 - 59:45)
still haven't caught farfetch like (59:44 - 59:47)
that's what I need to do before the (59:45 - 59:49)
event ends like it adds that sense of (59:47 - 59:51)
urgency or like that sense of like I (59:49 - 59:53)
want this and right now I feel like the (59:51 - 59:56)
current pokemon games don't have that (59:53 - 60:00)
and for drat you for me for saying what (59:56 - 60:01)
you're saying is you're not even gonna (60:00 - 60:05)
consider my dia my idea of random number (60:01 - 60:10)
GE 0 narration no no I think I think (60:05 - 60:13)
that's cool I think I think anything I (60:10 - 60:15)
mean it goes back to the problem we're (60:13 - 60:16)
like once somebody figures out what the (60:15 - 60:18)
rng is they just aren't you it and then (60:16 - 60:20)
you you get it you get problems we're (60:18 - 60:23)
like you know no pokemon are special (60:20 - 60:26)
because I'll just orangey a perfect IV (60:23 - 60:29)
like why would I do it any other way (60:26 - 60:31)
this is the way to get a perfect Pokemon (60:29 - 60:33)
and it like no shinies are really that (60:31 - 60:36)
rare shiny hunting is very popular and (60:33 - 60:38)
like you see a bunch of twitch streamers (60:36 - 60:40)
do it and it's and they get enjoyment (60:38 - 60:43)
out of it and that's cool and like I (60:40 - 60:45)
think shinies as a concept or really (60:43 - 60:47)
cool but when you can just orange (60:45 - 60:49)
yourself a shiny or just heck yourself a (60:47 - 60:52)
shiny it it almost like it destroys (60:49 - 60:55)
everyone else's enjoyment in some aspect (60:52 - 60:57)
and maybe not directly or what nap but (60:55 - 61:00)
that's why I brought up shuffle is like (60:57 - 61:03)
once a pokemon game authenticates to the (61:00 - 61:05)
internet prior to you logging in not (61:03 - 61:06)
saying that's going to happen or but I (61:05 - 61:09)
am saying that should happen you get rid (61:06 - 61:12)
of the ability for people to orangey (61:09 - 61:15)
that stuff or try to game the system and (61:12 - 61:17)
at the end of the day what that means to (61:15 - 61:20)
me or what I want is for that like (61:17 - 61:24)
environment to feel it felt in red and (61:20 - 61:26)
blue we're both besides before people (61:24 - 61:28)
figured out missingno and everything but (61:26 - 61:32)
like excited to find a pokemon or this (61:28 - 61:35)
shiny is actually rare or this pokemon (61:32 - 61:37)
with great IVs was special because you (61:35 - 61:39)
found it or you pre did it or or (61:37 - 61:41)
something along I'm rambling but I think (61:39 - 61:42)
you guys get the (61:41 - 61:45)
what I was gonna say cool story bro but (61:42 - 61:47)
you know Pokemon shuffles been hacked (61:45 - 61:49)
yeah i mean everything can that does it (61:47 - 61:52)
I mean you could say the same thing (61:49 - 61:54)
about like World of Warcraft or Final (61:52 - 61:57)
Fantasy 14 or destiny or anything like (61:54 - 62:00)
that like going to destiny like when you (61:57 - 62:02)
get a an exotic gun like that gun is (62:00 - 62:04)
exotic there's no other way to get it (62:02 - 62:06)
besides the way besides how the orange (62:04 - 62:09)
II worked or besides you doing the (62:06 - 62:10)
missions and the stories to get up to (62:09 - 62:13)
that point to get it or and that quote (62:10 - 62:15)
that feels cool that feels like you were (62:13 - 62:17)
collecting something in there's no real (62:15 - 62:19)
way to game the system so when you get (62:17 - 62:21)
it you get it and that feels great now I (62:19 - 62:24)
agree I agree I'm in with the shiny (62:21 - 62:27)
hunters I know quite a few people who (62:24 - 62:28)
are shiny hunters and they're quite (62:27 - 62:30)
dedicated to the craft yeah like I I (62:28 - 62:33)
have never yet seen a shiny in the wild (62:30 - 62:37)
and so like wow I know when I do find (62:33 - 62:39)
one hopefully we'll be in sun and moon (62:37 - 62:43)
like that that i will probably connect (62:39 - 62:45)
with that pokemon in like I mean it (62:43 - 62:47)
could be a Pokemon I hate or not not (62:45 - 62:49)
hate but like don't like like a geodude (62:47 - 62:52)
or something like I have zero attachment (62:49 - 62:55)
to Geodude I don't really care he exists (62:52 - 62:58)
whatever but if I like found a shiny one (62:55 - 63:00)
like that would probably mean a lot more (62:58 - 63:02)
to me and somebody could be like oh I'll (63:00 - 63:03)
just trade you a shiny and that's like (63:02 - 63:07)
that's not the same thing now I know so (63:03 - 63:08)
you feel like you'll have a deep (63:07 - 63:10)
romantic relationship with a shiny (63:08 - 63:13)
pokemon yes yeah you know and go on a (63:10 - 63:17)
giant journey of Dungeons and Dragons (63:13 - 63:20)
well I think I think that's our show I (63:17 - 63:21)
just want people to know that I'm not (63:20 - 63:25)
act that I I want to reiterate that my (63:21 - 63:27)
ultra conservatism only exists in (63:25 - 63:29)
relation to Pokemon and that's not at (63:27 - 63:32)
all how I am the real I want to (63:29 - 63:35)
reiterate i am not actually Ted Cruz's (63:32 - 63:39)
grandfather I am not actually yeah I (63:35 - 63:40)
won't get into that mean that's probably (63:39 - 63:43)
not PG for this show never mom keep (63:40 - 63:47)
going uh yeah so I think that wraps up (63:43 - 63:50)
our show if you're listening to this (63:47 - 63:54)
before friday which i mean yet 24 well (63:50 - 63:56)

saturday and sunday i think the weekend (64:00 - 64:07)
ticket is like 60 bucks we'll have to we (64:03 - 64:09)
use hooked up to each other via an (64:07 - 64:11)
ethernet cord this ancient piece of (64:09 - 64:13)
technology that carries internet across (64:11 - 64:15)
where we're going to try some local play (64:13 - 64:18)
pokin which is really cool out of the (64:15 - 64:20)
pokemon arcade machine that i built for (64:18 - 64:22)

as well and have some leftover t-shirts (64:24 - 64:29)
and everything that i'll be selling for (64:26 - 64:31)
probably like a dollar I'm just to this (64:29 - 64:33)
point just get rid of them we want a (64:31 - 64:35)
dollar t-shirt might be worth trucking (64:33 - 64:37)
out tuberculous concen well technically (64:35 - 64:42)
it be a 61 dollar t-shirt but still (64:37 - 64:45)
worth every every penny every penny (64:42 - 64:48)
