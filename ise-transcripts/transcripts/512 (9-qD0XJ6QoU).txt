okay so we got two (2:12 - 2:17)
big topics today one is a bunch of tcg (2:15 - 2:19)
news the other is a bunch of pokemon (2:17 - 2:20)
news (2:19 - 2:21)
sorry (2:20 - 2:24)
it's a pokemon podcast a lot of pokemon (2:21 - 2:25)
go news uh and we have a little stuff (2:24 - 2:27)
sprinkled in between (2:25 - 2:29)
um (2:27 - 2:31)
let's start with the pokemon go stuff (2:29 - 2:34)
because there was that interview (2:31 - 2:35)
with (2:34 - 2:37)
uh kelsey (2:35 - 2:38)
who is the community manager who (2:37 - 2:41)
replaced liz after liz left i think liz (2:38 - 2:43)
left pogo (2:41 - 2:44)
niantic (2:43 - 2:45)
to i think she ended up working at (2:44 - 2:48)
crunchyroll (2:45 - 2:51)
wow that's a good career good gig (2:48 - 2:53)
uh so (2:51 - 2:54)
so (2:53 - 2:57)
uh kelsey took their place (2:54 - 2:59)
and kelsey had an interview with trainer (2:57 - 3:01)
tips (2:59 - 3:01)
and (3:01 - 3:04)
i think it answered some questions at (3:02 - 3:07)
least there was questions that greg has (3:04 - 3:09)
asked on this program and i felt like (3:07 - 3:12)
kelsey did address those questions (3:09 - 3:14)
i will say that like i am in the niantic (3:12 - 3:16)
creator group thing you know i was a (3:14 - 3:19)
part of like the distance discussion (3:16 - 3:20)
when (3:19 - 3:23)
they wanted to expand the distance or (3:20 - 3:24)
they did expand the distance and then (3:23 - 3:26)
they reduced the distance and then they (3:24 - 3:28)
expanded it again (3:26 - 3:30)
and one of the rules in the creator (3:28 - 3:33)
group is i can say that like i talk to (3:30 - 3:35)
niantic but i can't say like i talk to (3:33 - 3:37)
liz or i talk to kelsey i'm not allowed (3:35 - 3:39)
to say who said what i'm just allowed to (3:37 - 3:42)
say niantic said this i can't say which (3:39 - 3:43)
person in niantic said that and i think (3:42 - 3:45)
that's part of like niantic's protection (3:43 - 3:47)
if i was like oh i talked to julie and (3:45 - 3:49)
then people might find julie on twitter (3:47 - 3:51)
and then they would be like julie but (3:49 - 3:52)
you said (3:51 - 3:55)
it's it's more of like a twitter sucks (3:52 - 3:59)
uh that's for sure (3:55 - 3:59)
so um (3:59 - 4:02)
yeah so sometimes i have to be vague of (4:01 - 4:04)
like niantic said this but i can't (4:02 - 4:07)
really say who at niantic said what but (4:04 - 4:09)
um (4:07 - 4:11)
but before we get to that (4:09 - 4:13)
interview uh let's talk about what's (4:11 - 4:16)
happening here in in pokemon go first (4:13 - 4:17)
off (4:16 - 4:18)
uh (4:17 - 4:22)

jessie euros (4:48 - 4:52)
um (4:50 - 4:53)
tickets are limited first come first (4:52 - 4:57)
serve so that's a little concerning for (4:53 - 4:58)
seattle (4:57 - 5:00)
uh because if they do first come first (4:58 - 5:02)
serve for that (5:00 - 5:03)

survived these things before (5:03 - 5:09)

you i i have missed all of the most (6:56 - 7:00)
recent (6:59 - 7:02)
uh community days held at the mall of (7:00 - 7:04)
america and therefore failed to get a (7:02 - 7:06)

but there but the berlin thing kind of (9:46 - 9:50)
lays out what the seattle thing is (9:48 - 9:51)
probably going to be that's why (9:50 - 9:53)
we don't know it's true (9:51 - 9:54)
but (9:53 - 9:56)
this is probably laying out the seattle (9:54 - 9:57)
thing as well (9:56 - 9:59)
as addition to our live events we're (9:57 - 10:00)
offering trainers the chance to enhance (9:59 - 10:02)
their event experience with special (10:00 - 10:04)

ticket cannot be added later (10:06 - 10:10)
um (10:08 - 10:13)
add-on bonuses will be i'm again i'm (10:10 - 10:14)
going to assume this is the same for (10:13 - 10:16)
seattle so when people buy their seattle (10:14 - 10:17)
ticket and they're like i didn't know i (10:16 - 10:18)
could add these on i want you have to (10:17 - 10:21)
add them on when you purchase the ticket (10:18 - 10:23)
um (10:21 - 10:23)
uh add-on bonuses will be active from (10:24 - 10:29)
friday july 3rd to saturday sunday july (10:26 - 10:32)
sorry friday july 1st to sunday july 3rd (10:29 - 10:33)
they will be only active within the (10:32 - 10:35)
pokemon go fest location indicated on (10:33 - 10:38)
your ticket you can have the raid lover (10:35 - 10:39)
add-on (10:38 - 10:41)
for 10 (10:39 - 10:44)
euros which is about the same 10. (10:41 - 10:48)
this grants 12 in-person raid passes uh (10:44 - 10:49)
each day (10:48 - 10:53)
so that's 30 raid passes holy cow i wait (10:49 - 10:58)
12 30 oh sorry 12. um 10 for 12. that's (10:53 - 11:00)
36 raid passes (10:58 - 11:03)
in-person raid passes okay (11:00 - 11:06)
so you get 12 raid passes each day (11:03 - 11:08)
friday saturday sunday (11:06 - 11:12)
um and an additional 5 000 xp after (11:08 - 11:15)
every raid you complete six additional (11:12 - 11:16)
candy (11:15 - 11:18)
rare candy three additional candy excel (11:16 - 11:21)
oh sorry not rare candy six additional (11:18 - 11:23)
candy and three additional candy xl (11:21 - 11:25)
after catching pokemon and five star (11:23 - 11:27)
raids (11:25 - 11:27)
so that's that's (11:27 - 11:32)
i think that's a good value (11:29 - 11:34)
if you like a raid pass a raid pass is a (11:32 - 11:36)
dollar (11:34 - 11:37)
so (11:36 - 11:38)
you get (11:37 - 11:41)
20 discount (11:38 - 11:46)
20 no it's like a 60 discount right (11:41 - 11:48)
oh wait for 10 you're getting 36. okay (11:46 - 11:50)
i'm sorry yeah it's not ten dollars a (11:48 - 11:53)
day okay yeah yeah it's ten dollars you (11:50 - 11:54)
have to use them right you can't you (11:53 - 11:56)
can't st the thing is you can't (11:54 - 11:58)
stockpile them right so it's a use or (11:56 - 11:59)
lose situation (11:58 - 12:02)
so if you are truly if you're not a raid (11:59 - 12:03)
lover (12:02 - 12:07)
then you should not buy the raid lover (12:03 - 12:07)
much like a pizza (12:07 - 12:12)
yes if you're not a meat lover don't get (12:09 - 12:14)
the meat lover pizza (12:12 - 12:15)
oh (12:14 - 12:17)
we oh peach de leche has the best (12:15 - 12:20)
seasonal pizza right now (12:17 - 12:22)
so good might be getting that for dinner (12:20 - 12:23)
thank you (12:22 - 12:26)
uh there's the critical catch add-on for (12:23 - 12:29)
10 10 euros (12:26 - 12:31)
um oh sorry critical (12:29 - 12:32)
hatch (12:31 - 12:34)
it's not catch is hatch (12:32 - 12:36)
hatch eggs 1 4 the normal distance this (12:34 - 12:38)
bonus does not stack with similar (12:36 - 12:41)
bonuses earn double xp (12:38 - 12:44)
double the candy and double the stardust (12:41 - 12:45)
this one seems worse because all the (12:44 - 12:47)
eggs are garbage this one's yeah this (12:45 - 12:50)
one seems bad because you'd have to buy (12:47 - 12:51)
more (12:50 - 12:53)
incubators (12:51 - 12:55)
if if they were like hey (12:53 - 12:58)
it's 1 4 the distance and we're giving (12:55 - 13:00)
you 10 incubators well how many (12:58 - 13:02)
incubators do they give you as part of (13:00 - 13:04)
your ticket to go fast because they (13:02 - 13:06)
might be throwing in incubators there i (13:04 - 13:08)
don't think any (13:06 - 13:11)
they would have said (13:08 - 13:11)
i mean you like (13:11 - 13:18)
if gofest was only giving you 2k eggs (13:13 - 13:18)
and you had not a (13:18 - 13:24)
full collection of 7k eggs and you're (13:21 - 13:26)
walking all weekend you could burn (13:24 - 13:28)
through 2k eggs like left and right (13:26 - 13:30)
especially with like yeah the free but (13:28 - 13:32)
this still doesn't seem that great at (13:30 - 13:33)
what is the name of the park briggle (13:32 - 13:35)
bagel (13:33 - 13:38)
the britzer the blizzard let's so when (13:35 - 13:41)
you go the thing is at that park when (13:38 - 13:43)
you go to their spiegel zone time goes (13:41 - 13:46)
slower but you right so you can hatch (13:43 - 13:49)
more eggs it's just a feature of that (13:46 - 13:52)
particular area of the park (13:49 - 13:55)
this one seems bad though (13:52 - 13:55)
i mean the raid one doesn't seem great (13:56 - 14:01)
no the red one seems awesome because (13:58 - 14:03)
the raids aren't great (14:01 - 14:05)
they're crying crystalia yeah they've (14:03 - 14:08)
been there before like i don't need it (14:05 - 14:09)
either (14:08 - 14:10)
if you don't (14:09 - 14:12)
sure if you were a person that was like (14:10 - 14:14)
i only do raids i get the shiny and then (14:12 - 14:19)
i'm done understandable but like if if (14:14 - 14:21)
i i would personally like (14:19 - 14:24)
doing raids like if i'm playing pogo all (14:21 - 14:25)
day (14:24 - 14:27)
and all day is probably 10 hours that's (14:25 - 14:28)
like one raid an hour and i'm playing (14:27 - 14:30)
all weekend and i'm going to do the (14:28 - 14:32)
raids anyways and even though i have (14:30 - 14:34)
three shiny dark cry and too shiny (14:32 - 14:35)
cresselia (14:34 - 14:38)
the amount of xp the extra candy the (14:35 - 14:40)
like rare candy (14:38 - 14:42)
i want that stuff (14:40 - 14:44)
um and i can always use more darkrai (14:42 - 14:46)
chrysalia i don't need any more but i (14:44 - 14:48)
can always use more dark cry but that (14:46 - 14:49)
also like we don't know if there's rock (14:48 - 14:50)
rocks (14:49 - 14:52)
we don't know if there's a low than (14:50 - 14:54)
raichus like there are other raids i (14:52 - 14:55)
would do (14:54 - 14:57)
not specifically (14:55 - 15:00)
darkrai and cresselia (14:57 - 15:02)
um (15:00 - 15:04)
but yeah if you're like (15:02 - 15:05)
i already have shiny dark cry i already (15:04 - 15:07)
have shiny chrysalia i don't care about (15:05 - 15:09)
xp i don't care about candy yet don't (15:07 - 15:12)
yeah don't spend the 10 bucks (15:09 - 15:14)
i i think we did (15:12 - 15:17)
for go fest was it go fest um yeah it (15:14 - 15:19)
was go fest last year because we did day (15:17 - 15:20)
one (15:19 - 15:21)
in (15:20 - 15:23)
the art park and we did day two at mall (15:21 - 15:24)
of america (15:23 - 15:27)
and i think we ended up doing i ended up (15:24 - 15:30)
doing 40 to 50 raids at mall of america (15:27 - 15:31)
and i had all those pokemon there was (15:30 - 15:34)
nothing i needed (15:31 - 15:35)
that was like when hoopa was bringing in (15:34 - 15:39)
the the enteis and the lugias and the (15:35 - 15:41)
but i had a great time that day (15:39 - 15:44)
i i did too but i did not i did not (15:41 - 15:45)
waste my money on raids on things i (15:44 - 15:48)
already had i did my ones and i'm like (15:45 - 15:49)
thanks (15:48 - 15:52)
no more money from me (15:49 - 15:52)
uh so uh going back a couple things here (15:53 - 15:58)
it's i'm gonna assume that (15:56 - 16:01)
well we we know that regular hedgehog (15:58 - 16:02)
shaman (16:01 - 16:05)
is for go fest next month (16:02 - 16:08)
yeah so it looks like if you want skye 4 (16:05 - 16:12)
sky form shaymin the deer (16:08 - 16:14)
it will probably be here well it is here (16:12 - 16:17)
seattle and then japan and then i'm (16:14 - 16:19)
assuming there's that like six months (16:17 - 16:20)
wait and then everyone will get that's (16:19 - 16:22)
right right then and then everybody will (16:20 - 16:24)
get it at a later time (16:22 - 16:27)
and then there's a shiny pan sear at (16:24 - 16:29)
germany (16:27 - 16:31)
so i'm assuming america will get shiny (16:29 - 16:34)
pan pour and then japan will get shiny (16:31 - 16:36)
japan (16:34 - 16:37)
which one do we have we have poor we (16:36 - 16:39)
have the water one do we have the water (16:37 - 16:40)
one (16:39 - 16:41)
yeah (16:40 - 16:42)
we have the water one (16:41 - 16:45)
germany has the fire and then japan has (16:42 - 16:47)
the grass okay (16:45 - 16:51)
you know i am i have never been a fan of (16:47 - 16:52)
skyform shaymin (16:51 - 16:54)
oh yeah no skype for shaman is bad the (16:52 - 16:57)
hedgehog one is better yeah way better (16:54 - 16:59)
it's got (16:57 - 17:00)
like i'm even trying to like somebody (16:59 - 17:02)
who made this cool looking play mat and (17:00 - 17:04)
i'm like no it's just does not look well (17:02 - 17:06)
it's like why is it called sky form it (17:04 - 17:08)
doesn't have wings it's not well the (17:06 - 17:09)
ears the giant it could fly it's (17:08 - 17:12)
supposed to be its wings it can float (17:09 - 17:13)
around (17:12 - 17:15)
but when i think of sky i don't think of (17:13 - 17:18)
deer (17:15 - 17:19)
not with that dude you didn't play (17:18 - 17:21)
enough elden ring i didn't play anybody (17:19 - 17:23)
else (17:21 - 17:25)
in that game they're playing a lot of (17:23 - 17:27)
things in that game (17:25 - 17:30)
tiny horse in that game so let's (17:27 - 17:32)
got birds with swords attached to their (17:30 - 17:33)
feet (17:32 - 17:35)
sword birds (17:33 - 17:38)
that's gonna come in scarlet and violet (17:35 - 17:39)
all the elden ring bosses will be (17:38 - 17:41)
pokemon now (17:39 - 17:43)
this i mean like the layout of this (17:41 - 17:45)
makes me excited for seattle obviously (17:43 - 17:47)
seattle's gonna be 25 bucks though right (17:45 - 17:48)
like oh yeah (17:47 - 17:49)
i mean (17:48 - 17:52)
it's gonna be roughly the same price (17:49 - 17:54)
um and they're probably gonna have these (17:52 - 17:55)
bonuses and it's probably gonna be the (17:54 - 17:57)
same day and it's probably gonna be you (17:55 - 18:01)
know all three days (17:57 - 18:01)
i'm excited i (18:01 - 18:04)
i think (18:06 - 18:10)
because i spent a twitch stream looking (18:08 - 18:13)
at the map of seattle (18:10 - 18:15)
i think that the that go fest is (18:13 - 18:17)
probably going to be the seattle center (18:15 - 18:20)
where the space needle is (18:17 - 18:23)
um and when my wife and i were there (18:20 - 18:24)
this (18:23 - 18:26)
past weekend we went to the seattle (18:24 - 18:28)
center mostly because i was like uh (18:26 - 18:30)
where else do you go in seattle right (18:28 - 18:31)
you go downtown seattle you go to (18:30 - 18:34)
seattle center you the market (18:31 - 18:36)
you're the market the original starbucks (18:34 - 18:38)
and i walked around the seattle center (18:36 - 18:40)
and i was like (18:38 - 18:42)
this is doable this is big the thing (18:40 - 18:45)
though is like (18:42 - 18:45)
there's a lot of um (18:45 - 18:49)
street performers (18:47 - 18:51)
at the seattle center and i wonder if (18:49 - 18:53)
they close that weekend off to them (18:51 - 18:55)
because most street performers need (18:53 - 18:58)
permits to perform (18:55 - 19:00)
um (18:58 - 19:00)
and (19:01 - 19:04)
they can't like what they did with the (19:02 - 19:06)
chicago that with the (19:04 - 19:08)
at the zoo in chicago they couldn't (19:06 - 19:11)
close down the zoo (19:08 - 19:12)
so people could still walk through it's (19:11 - 19:14)
just the ticket shows you more stops and (19:12 - 19:17)
spawns and stuff so (19:14 - 19:19)
it could there are like three other (19:17 - 19:22)
parks it could be at in seattle (19:19 - 19:23)
but the other reason i think it's the (19:22 - 19:25)
seattle center is because um those (19:23 - 19:27)
in-person niantic meetups that they've (19:25 - 19:29)
been doing for the last this will be (19:27 - 19:31)
month three (19:29 - 19:34)
may is month three the last two for the (19:31 - 19:38)
seattle area were at the seattle center (19:34 - 19:41)
so if anything they were testing (19:38 - 19:44)
that if they have it in bellevue at the (19:41 - 19:46)
nintendo headquarters (19:44 - 19:48)
ah (19:46 - 19:48)
then you get a cup of coffee with reggie (19:48 - 19:54)
when you're done catching yeah (19:50 - 19:54)
um (19:54 - 19:59)
i have my stuff booked for seattle (19:55 - 19:59)
so i'm i'm excited (20:00 - 20:04)
i want to go to berlin but i don't think (20:02 - 20:07)
that's going to be in the budget (20:04 - 20:09)
this is where i plug the patreon and (20:07 - 20:13)
then no i'm just kidding uh (20:09 - 20:16)
speaking of raids mega latios and latias (20:13 - 20:19)
soar into new heights in global air the (20:16 - 20:23)
global pokemon air adventure event (20:19 - 20:25)
so they revamped mega evolution they put (20:23 - 20:27)
mega kangaskhan in raids there was a (20:25 - 20:29)
mega kangaskhan event (20:27 - 20:31)
that was um (20:29 - 20:33)
it's make a mega king (20:31 - 20:35)
kangaskhan spawned for three hours is (20:33 - 20:37)
what was a one in ten chance of getting (20:35 - 20:39)
a shiny gave you five free raid passes (20:37 - 20:41)
that was like a pretty great event even (20:39 - 20:43)
though it was poorly advertised and i (20:41 - 20:46)
felt like no one knew was happening (20:43 - 20:47)
uh this event will be over by the time (20:46 - 20:49)
this podcast comes up but it was from (20:47 - 20:52)
tuesday may 3rd to sunday may 8th mega (20:49 - 20:54)
latios and latias make their mega raid (20:52 - 20:55)
debuts (20:54 - 20:57)
um (20:55 - 20:59)
then flying pikachu and a bunch of other (20:57 - 21:01)
pokemon spawning in the wild charizard (20:59 - 21:04)
mantine spawning in the wild (21:01 - 21:05)
uh (21:04 - 21:07)
these i don't know if you guys have done (21:05 - 21:11)
a mega latios latias (21:07 - 21:12)
no (21:11 - 21:14)
they are like six star raids yeah i've (21:12 - 21:17)
done one there they have like instead of (21:14 - 21:21)
like 65 000 hp they have like 88 000 hp (21:17 - 21:24)
they're real they're tough (21:21 - 21:25)
um (21:24 - 21:27)
they really (21:25 - 21:27)
if you are remote rating in you need (21:28 - 21:32)
everyone to accept your remote rate if (21:30 - 21:34)
you want any (21:32 - 21:37)
i mean it's close like i i did it with (21:34 - 21:38)
six (21:37 - 21:42)
um everyone was 40 or close to 40. (21:38 - 21:45)
so it was uh one (21:42 - 21:47)
one person and then the five invites so (21:45 - 21:48)
it was six of us we finished with like (21:47 - 21:50)
30 seconds left (21:48 - 21:53)
and five of us had megas which like to (21:50 - 21:55)
be fair if you're going to be doing mega (21:53 - 21:58)
latios mega latias pick something to (21:55 - 22:02)
mega pick like mega houndoom or mega (21:58 - 22:03)
gengar or (22:02 - 22:06)
um (22:03 - 22:09)
no not pidgey yet wow (22:06 - 22:09)
it's weak to (22:09 - 22:15)
darken dragon not flying normal (22:10 - 22:17)
mega pidgey i ain't gonna help you yeah (22:15 - 22:19)
but i have those i have those candies (22:17 - 22:20)
you don't need the candy anymore you (22:19 - 22:21)
just (22:20 - 22:23)
it's free but i have to do it i had to (22:21 - 22:25)
do it the first time (22:23 - 22:26)
oh you're saying you don't have the (22:25 - 22:29)
candy to get it the first time right (22:26 - 22:31)
well how am i gonna do the hound doom (22:29 - 22:35)
that's got 40 mega candies nothing (22:31 - 22:35)
like that what do you want from me i was (22:35 - 22:39)
trying to invite you to every mega hound (22:37 - 22:41)
there was (22:39 - 22:43)
i am not paying money for a mega hound (22:41 - 22:45)
doom (22:43 - 22:48)
i'm not paying money (22:45 - 22:48)
not in this economy not in this economy (22:49 - 22:55)
have you seen we have a hound doom at (22:53 - 22:57)
home you don't need a mega hound doom (22:55 - 23:01)
exactly exactly (22:57 - 23:01)
you don't even play with the hound doom (23:02 - 23:06)
you have here why do you go out (23:04 - 23:10)
a different one (23:06 - 23:12)
it begs the question though that because (23:10 - 23:14)
these mega (23:12 - 23:14)
these mega legendary pokemon require (23:15 - 23:19)
pretty much everyone to join the remote (23:19 - 23:22)
raid pass (23:21 - 23:25)
there is the like (23:22 - 23:27)
i don't know is worry the right word (23:25 - 23:29)
there is the (23:27 - 23:32)
concern (23:29 - 23:32)
okay so there are some people that are (23:32 - 23:35)
like i hope niantic doesn't remove (23:33 - 23:37)
remote raid passes they (23:35 - 23:39)
why would they they like when they (23:37 - 23:40)
rolled out the remote raid passes pure (23:39 - 23:42)
money (23:40 - 23:43)
when they rolled out the remote rate (23:42 - 23:45)
passes they said (23:43 - 23:48)
that they weren't going to remove them (23:45 - 23:49)
and they said that (23:48 - 23:51)
right now (23:49 - 23:53)
you have a normal attack damage but in (23:51 - 23:54)
the future (23:53 - 23:57)
it would be reduced attack damage so you (23:54 - 23:58)
could still remote in you just wouldn't (23:57 - 24:00)
be as strong (23:58 - 24:02)
and they haven't removed that nerf but (24:00 - 24:05)
that they they never said (24:02 - 24:06)
this is just temporary because of the (24:05 - 24:09)
pandemic like this is (24:06 - 24:12)
i i'd money aside like it is a feature (24:09 - 24:13)
that helps (24:12 - 24:15)
a lot of people do raids and play their (24:13 - 24:18)
game like it keeps people getting money (24:15 - 24:19)
and it makes i'm sure it makes them a (24:18 - 24:21)
ton of money it's the double it's the (24:19 - 24:24)
double win (24:21 - 24:27)
um and even (24:24 - 24:27)
even if they reduce the (24:28 - 24:32)
the damage which they probably will (24:30 - 24:34)
eventually don't know when that's going (24:32 - 24:35)
to be probably after go fest would be my (24:34 - 24:36)
assumption (24:35 - 24:38)
yeah they're just going to slide it in (24:36 - 24:41)
and say hey new feature for all you (24:38 - 24:43)
it might be harder to do raids which is (24:41 - 24:45)
more exciting for the community (24:43 - 24:49)
tougher raids means more fun (24:45 - 24:51)
okay so this is a thing i talked to (24:49 - 24:52)
niantic about (24:51 - 24:54)
they (24:52 - 24:56)
and uh i i always get worried about what (24:54 - 24:58)
i'm allowed to say and not say but they (24:56 - 25:00)
they said like the the toughness of the (24:58 - 25:02)
raid isn't the challenge it's getting (25:00 - 25:03)
people together (25:02 - 25:05)
which to be fair when i played final (25:03 - 25:08)
fantasy 14 that was also the challenge (25:05 - 25:10)
is getting people together (25:08 - 25:11)
yeah but that's the toughness of the (25:10 - 25:13)
raid that requires you to have other (25:11 - 25:15)
people to successfully succeed in the (25:13 - 25:16)
raid (25:15 - 25:19)
they they quickly instituted (25:16 - 25:21)
the the auto (25:19 - 25:23)
connect for raids like that's not a (25:21 - 25:25)
thing you just okay sign up (25:23 - 25:26)
in (25:25 - 25:27)
like (25:26 - 25:28)
but you are assuming people know how to (25:27 - 25:32)
do their roles everybody i mean (25:28 - 25:34)
everybody knows how to do their roles (25:32 - 25:35)
like the only thing you have to worry (25:34 - 25:37)
about is a bad healer (25:35 - 25:39)
okay and that can and that can prevent (25:37 - 25:41)
the whole raid from happening that (25:39 - 25:42)
i mean it doesn't because they get (25:41 - 25:44)
frustrated and leave and then you get a (25:42 - 25:45)
different healer that you just say hey (25:44 - 25:47)
find me somebody else okay but the core (25:45 - 25:49)
of that problem is getting people (25:47 - 25:51)
together (25:49 - 25:53)
like that is still that is still that is (25:51 - 25:56)
still the problem like in destiny (25:53 - 25:57)
in in their raids they didn't have (25:56 - 25:59)
matchmaking because well i think they (25:57 - 26:00)
have match banking now but they didn't (25:59 - 26:02)
have matchmaking for like the first four (26:00 - 26:03)
years of that game and their reason was (26:02 - 26:06)
like you actually need like people with (26:03 - 26:08)
headsets you need to talk to people and (26:06 - 26:10)
if if if we just do matchmaking and you (26:08 - 26:11)
don't get people with headsets you're (26:10 - 26:12)
not going to be able to complete these (26:11 - 26:14)
raids (26:12 - 26:16)
and (26:14 - 26:20)
there were count like i i i i look back (26:16 - 26:21)
before i was like a full-time creator (26:20 - 26:24)
and i had just a 9-5 job and i would (26:21 - 26:26)
spend like six hours on a single raid (26:24 - 26:28)
and it was because like (26:26 - 26:30)
one person (26:28 - 26:32)
would cause that raid to fail over and (26:30 - 26:34)
over and it wasn't maybe the same person (26:32 - 26:36)
every time but definitely (26:34 - 26:39)
i won't name (26:36 - 26:39)
raids in destiny with hundreds of people (26:42 - 26:47)
and i and just like pokemon go there was (26:44 - 26:50)
no built-in raid find a friend i had to (26:47 - 26:52)
go to reddit i had to go to like custom (26:50 - 26:54)
build websites and we would have to get (26:52 - 26:56)
people together and you would get two (26:54 - 26:57)
hours into a raid and somebody would be (26:56 - 26:58)
like (26:57 - 27:01)
i gotta go get dinner and like (26:58 - 27:03)
okay now we gotta find us we gotta find (27:01 - 27:05)
a person that wants to join mid-raid (27:03 - 27:06)
where we're at because a lot of people (27:05 - 27:07)
are like no i don't want to join (27:06 - 27:09)
mid-range i want all the rewards why (27:07 - 27:11)
would i want to skip the the the first (27:09 - 27:12)
two rewards (27:11 - 27:15)
um (27:12 - 27:15)
so i do think like (27:15 - 27:19)
yes the challenge is getting people (27:17 - 27:20)
together and right now remote raid (27:19 - 27:23)
passes makes that very easy because (27:20 - 27:26)
everyone's just sitting on their couch (27:23 - 27:26)
i still again i think it's wild for (27:28 - 27:31)
these games to be like the challenge is (27:30 - 27:33)
getting people together and we're not (27:31 - 27:34)
going to help (27:33 - 27:36)
that yes (27:34 - 27:38)
go to facebook (27:36 - 27:40)
find some other way because we're not (27:38 - 27:43)
doing it yeah that's what we think the (27:40 - 27:45)
problem is i really wish they would have (27:43 - 27:47)
something that was like along with the (27:45 - 27:48)
remote raid past something that was like (27:47 - 27:51)
i i will join i'm looking to do a lot of (27:48 - 27:52)
eos raid (27:51 - 27:54)
i don't have one near me (27:52 - 27:57)
can you remote me into a currently (27:54 - 28:00)
ladies raid right so that i they it's (27:57 - 28:02)
like automatic matchmaking that way i (28:00 - 28:04)
mean there's two things that final (28:02 - 28:06)
fantasy does for that you can go to (28:04 - 28:08)
party finder which are established (28:06 - 28:09)
groups and you can say i would like to (28:08 - 28:10)
join your group (28:09 - 28:13)
and the group says what they're doing (28:10 - 28:14)
what they're looking for and the rules (28:13 - 28:18)
they have or are you going to the random (28:14 - 28:20)
looking for group just i want to do this (28:18 - 28:22)
right hit the button and i don't care (28:20 - 28:25)
who i go in with because i know that (28:22 - 28:28)
everybody has to have x item level (28:25 - 28:30)
yeah yeah but this is even less (28:28 - 28:32)
consequential right because it's there's (28:30 - 28:34)
not roles right in pokemon yeah i mean (28:32 - 28:38)
like in pogo you you can you can invite (28:34 - 28:39)
six people (28:38 - 28:41)
sorry five people to a rock ruff and (28:39 - 28:43)
everyone could bring magic carps and (28:41 - 28:45)
you'll be able to succeed (28:43 - 28:47)
and in (28:45 - 28:49)
latios latias (28:47 - 28:51)
that's not possible like you actually (28:49 - 28:53)
have to have people bring pretty okay (28:51 - 28:55)
counters and you have to have enough (28:53 - 28:57)
people (28:55 - 29:00)
and i think that's fine (28:57 - 29:02)
and i think even if remote raid passes (29:00 - 29:04)
are nerfed (29:02 - 29:05)
and i (29:04 - 29:08)
i should say when they are nerfed (29:05 - 29:11)
for the most part they'll still be fine (29:08 - 29:13)
like you'll be able to still walk up to (29:11 - 29:15)
a rock rough invite five people and the (29:13 - 29:17)
the decreased damage isn't going to (29:15 - 29:18)
matter (29:17 - 29:20)
the same for like alolan raichu which is (29:18 - 29:22)
like a three star you'll still be able (29:20 - 29:25)
to walk up invite (29:22 - 29:26)
two or three people then the decreased (29:25 - 29:28)
damage isn't going to matter (29:26 - 29:30)
um (29:28 - 29:32)
i i think though like we're going to get (29:30 - 29:35)
to a point where i want to do landorus (29:32 - 29:37)
i'm here at location for landorus i (29:35 - 29:39)
invite five people and (29:37 - 29:41)
if everyone it knows what they're doing (29:39 - 29:43)
it's probably going to be possible but (29:41 - 29:46)
if people are bringing agron and and (29:43 - 29:49)
not any ice types it might fail because (29:46 - 29:52)
the damage might not be enough (29:49 - 29:54)
but i think that landorus situation is (29:52 - 29:56)
easily solved if two people are standing (29:54 - 29:57)
at landorus (29:56 - 30:00)
and they invite five people each (29:57 - 30:02)
i think i think that's the reality (30:00 - 30:04)
and (30:02 - 30:05)
should (30:04 - 30:09)
legendary pokemon be harder or yeah i (30:05 - 30:12)
guess (30:09 - 30:12)
i don't know i i guess like i i (30:12 - 30:21)
i don't see it as a huge issue (30:16 - 30:21)
but it but i think it goes back to that (30:23 - 30:27)
conversation we had two weeks ago (30:24 - 30:28)
which is (30:27 - 30:32)
if i see a rock rough on the street (30:28 - 30:35)
i can walk there (30:32 - 30:37)
ten minute walk there use my free raid (30:35 - 30:38)
pass (30:37 - 30:41)
do it 10 minute walk back that's 20 (30:38 - 30:43)
minutes out of my day for a rock rough (30:41 - 30:44)
or (30:43 - 30:47)
i could just remote in for a dollar (30:44 - 30:50)
at my house do it get the same rewards (30:47 - 30:52)
the only difference is i spent a dollar (30:50 - 30:55)
to get 20 minutes of my time back yeah (30:52 - 30:57)
yeah (30:55 - 30:59)
so if if (30:57 - 31:01)
if and when niantic nerfs remote raid (30:59 - 31:04)
passes they'll still be useful (31:01 - 31:06)
and they'll still be great to be like oh (31:04 - 31:10)
i would love to get in on a landorus (31:06 - 31:13)
but that doesn't solve the issue of (31:10 - 31:15)
is it worth me spending 20 minutes to (31:13 - 31:17)
walk the rock back like (31:15 - 31:19)
if anything they need to make (31:17 - 31:21)
if they want us to go out and play (31:19 - 31:24)
together (31:21 - 31:24)
i need i need a reason to walk to that (31:26 - 31:30)
right you need a better incentive yeah i (31:27 - 31:32)
think the biggest issue that a lot of (31:30 - 31:35)
these companies don't understand (31:32 - 31:37)
or aren't willing to accept is that if (31:35 - 31:40)
people are willing to pay money (31:37 - 31:41)
to (31:40 - 31:43)
not have to do the garbage you want them (31:41 - 31:45)
to do (31:43 - 31:46)
and more and more people are paying the (31:45 - 31:48)
money then the thing that you're asking (31:46 - 31:50)
them to do isn't fun (31:48 - 31:53)
it's not something that people enjoy (31:50 - 31:55)
if i can get a good experience and i (31:53 - 31:57)
don't have to drive half an hour to mall (31:55 - 32:00)
of america to get to a rate i can just (31:57 - 32:01)
remote in there because i can see it or (32:00 - 32:05)
somebody else is there i'm gonna do that (32:01 - 32:07)
it's like the act of doing these things (32:05 - 32:09)
isn't fun so of course people are going (32:07 - 32:13)
to take a shortcut when it's not (32:09 - 32:15)
fun i mean there's the reason why people (32:13 - 32:17)
buy (32:15 - 32:20)
bump me to 60 in final fantasy 14 like i (32:17 - 32:22)
don't want to play the first 60 levels (32:20 - 32:23)
jump me (32:22 - 32:26)
i don't want to do that content it's not (32:23 - 32:27)
great i mean it's a lot better now (32:26 - 32:28)
because they revamped it all but yeah (32:27 - 32:30)
it's like (32:28 - 32:32)
at least they understand and some level (32:30 - 32:35)
like doing this content eats up your (32:32 - 32:38)
time and isn't particularly fun (32:35 - 32:40)
and where i get stuck with niantic is (32:38 - 32:44)
niantic is still in this mindset of (32:40 - 32:47)
well it is fun you just don't get it (32:44 - 32:50)
it's like well greg you don't get it (32:47 - 32:52)
just admit you don't get it i've been (32:50 - 32:54)
playing since lunch (32:52 - 32:56)
what's there to get (32:54 - 32:59)
it's just not fun for you yeah and i've (32:56 - 33:01)
said like i like walking i like going (32:59 - 33:03)
outside like it's getting nice out every (33:01 - 33:04)
night i've i've walked around the block (33:03 - 33:06)
for 20 minutes and i boot up pikmin and (33:04 - 33:08)
i plant flowers and i walk to three gyms (33:06 - 33:09)
and (33:08 - 33:11)
if they're blue i'd put something in if (33:09 - 33:13)
they're not blue and they're weak i'll (33:11 - 33:14)
i'll spend the like (33:13 - 33:16)
45 seconds to knock it out (33:14 - 33:19)
like finish my lap (33:16 - 33:21)
um (33:19 - 33:23)
but yeah if it's if it's a day where (33:21 - 33:24)
like you know i'm waking up i'm getting (33:23 - 33:27)
a bunch of work done i got a stream like (33:24 - 33:30)
raids don't exist at 11 so if i want to (33:27 - 33:32)
sneak in a rock rough (33:30 - 33:34)
i just don't have the 20 30 minutes to (33:32 - 33:36)
like walk to it and that's my problem (33:34 - 33:39)
right like (33:36 - 33:42)
but if if the if the in-person rewards (33:39 - 33:45)
were more satisfying i would consider it (33:42 - 33:46)
yeah (33:45 - 33:49)
and we're just not there yet and who (33:46 - 33:51)
knows if we will get there yet that (33:49 - 33:52)
leads into the conversation (33:51 - 33:55)
with kelsey (33:52 - 33:56)
uh (33:55 - 33:59)
and i i think he was you guys both (33:56 - 34:00)
watched it (33:59 - 34:02)
i i don't remember a thing i'm gonna be (34:00 - 34:03)
honest (34:02 - 34:05)
i don't remember anything about it at (34:03 - 34:08)
this point uh i did watch it i remember (34:05 - 34:10)
being (34:08 - 34:10)
distracted by the interview (34:12 - 34:15)
same (34:16 - 34:18)
uh but i think i remember enough of it (34:19 - 34:24)
uh i have a conversation about it (34:21 - 34:25)
yeah one of the questions i think the (34:24 - 34:27)
the probably the question that is (34:25 - 34:31)
probably pulled the most is the the (34:27 - 34:31)
um disability stuff (34:31 - 34:37)
and (34:35 - 34:37)
kelsey did say they said that niantic (34:37 - 34:43)
does care about disability and (34:40 - 34:44)
accessibility (34:43 - 34:46)
and they are still trying to figure out (34:44 - 34:50)
what that solution is (34:46 - 34:50)
and they said that that was their first (34:51 - 34:55)
priority coming in as the community (34:53 - 34:58)
manager about that they just don't have (34:55 - 35:01)
answers for people yet (34:58 - 35:04)
so reassuring to hear (35:01 - 35:04)
i'm waiting for greg to say something (35:08 - 35:12)
this isn't (35:11 - 35:15)
this isn't a hard thing to find (35:12 - 35:17)
out and that's (35:15 - 35:19)
that's where i sort of get stuck on (35:17 - 35:21)
those answers it's like at one point you (35:19 - 35:23)
want to say it's a priority you have (35:21 - 35:25)
huge swaths of community people that (35:23 - 35:28)
will happily talk to you about this (35:25 - 35:30)
that will happily sit down and say (35:28 - 35:32)
here's the things that we need here's (35:30 - 35:34)
the stuff that (35:32 - 35:35)
makes a difference there have been (35:34 - 35:37)
people complaining about your changes (35:35 - 35:40)
since you've put them in and so it (35:37 - 35:42)
always feels so (35:40 - 35:45)
disingenuously corporate to me but like (35:42 - 35:47)
we understand it's a problem but we (35:45 - 35:49)
don't have solutions yet we don't really (35:47 - 35:51)
understand what people need which is (35:49 - 35:53)
just like you still haven't made it a (35:51 - 35:57)
priority to ask those people (35:53 - 35:57)
but okay (35:59 - 36:03)
i'm not trying to defend anyone (36:01 - 36:05)
but i do remember kelsey saying that (36:03 - 36:09)
they do that that people should use the (36:05 - 36:10)
the (36:09 - 36:12)
actual feedback form on niantic's (36:10 - 36:15)
website (36:12 - 36:15)
and they do read everything that comes (36:16 - 36:19)
they have to legally read everything (36:17 - 36:21)
that comes back through that feedback (36:19 - 36:23)
form (36:21 - 36:25)
versus (36:23 - 36:28)
the terribleness of twitter and reddit (36:25 - 36:30)
hmm (36:28 - 36:30)
i mean (36:32 - 36:34)
like i'm not even that big of a content (36:35 - 36:39)
creator (36:37 - 36:41)
in the grand scheme of things and i (36:39 - 36:44)
think nick made a joke about this uh (36:41 - 36:45)
nick the the trainer tips the person (36:44 - 36:47)
interviewing kelsey was like i don't (36:45 - 36:49)
even read my youtube comments anymore (36:47 - 36:51)
he he was like i just can't there's too (36:49 - 36:53)
many and (36:51 - 36:56)
and like i i have gotten in the instance (36:53 - 36:58)
of like even on my not even my own posts (36:56 - 37:00)
but clicking on somebody else's post and (36:58 - 37:02)
looking at the comments i'm just like (37:00 - 37:05)
this is disgusting like who would ever (37:02 - 37:08)
no one gets paid enough money (37:05 - 37:11)
to sit here and dig through this stuff (37:08 - 37:13)
like it's just so mentally draining on (37:11 - 37:15)
twitter sometimes (37:13 - 37:17)
so it's like (37:15 - 37:18)
i am sure there are tons of people on (37:17 - 37:21)
twitter providing excellent suggestions (37:18 - 37:24)
of what can be beneficial (37:21 - 37:25)
to (37:24 - 37:27)
make the game more accessible (37:25 - 37:30)
but that's like (37:27 - 37:30)
probably a dime a dozen compared to just (37:31 - 37:36)
the garbage you have to sit through i (37:33 - 37:38)
mean and i feel like that's customer (37:36 - 37:41)
service like everybody's saying oh it's (37:38 - 37:44)
so hard to do this do a customer service (37:41 - 37:44)
job (37:44 - 37:47)
sit in a call center and take these very (37:44 - 37:51)
calls day in and day out that is the job (37:47 - 37:53)
i think there's a big difference between (37:51 - 37:55)
somebody hiding behind a keyboard (37:53 - 37:57)
smashing some garbage at a tweet versus (37:55 - 37:59)
somebody taking the time to call in you (37:57 - 38:01)
will still get garbage people calling in (37:59 - 38:04)
you are ignoring that everybody at a t (38:01 - 38:06)
and there's a team of people that have (38:04 - 38:08)
to go through every tweet that's at them (38:06 - 38:10)
to read it there is a chat form that (38:08 - 38:12)
they chat in that's a person behind the (38:10 - 38:14)
keyboard ripping them in that they you (38:12 - 38:16)
just go to the website and say chat live (38:14 - 38:20)
these are things that corporations do (38:16 - 38:22)
like to sit there and say i can't read (38:20 - 38:23)
all of that because i don't know what's (38:22 - 38:25)
garbage (38:23 - 38:28)
that's what multi-billion corporations (38:25 - 38:28)
do (38:28 - 38:31)
every day day in and day (38:28 - 38:32)
out that isn't (38:31 - 38:34)
jobs i don't think niantic's twitter (38:32 - 38:36)
team is niantic i think it's a third (38:34 - 38:38)
party that's why that's why they're (38:36 - 38:40)
always wrong but i mean (38:38 - 38:41)
then i mean if you're going to outsource (38:40 - 38:43)
it then you need to work with your (38:41 - 38:45)
outsourcing group right (38:43 - 38:48)
source for stuff keep in mind for as (38:45 - 38:50)
large as niantic is there they're (38:48 - 38:53)
nowhere near as large as a t or any (38:50 - 38:54)
major (38:53 - 38:56)
international but they also don't have (38:54 - 38:59)
the same size customer base either like (38:56 - 39:01)
they're not as big but the customer base (38:59 - 39:03)
isn't as large either (39:01 - 39:06)
like it is a scalable thing like (39:03 - 39:08)
until you reminded people that there's a (39:06 - 39:10)
feedback form (39:08 - 39:11)
people don't think there's a feeling you (39:10 - 39:15)
even knew that there was a feedback (39:11 - 39:15)
apparently no one knew there was a (39:16 - 39:19)
feedback right (39:18 - 39:20)
so (39:19 - 39:23)
we've hidden we we've not made it that (39:20 - 39:26)
easily accessible either like it is it (39:23 - 39:29)
is still a corporation's issue if you if (39:26 - 39:31)
you want (39:29 - 39:33)
feedback that way to put out a statement (39:31 - 39:36)
on your blog and on your twitter (39:33 - 39:37)
these we understand that these are your (39:36 - 39:39)
issues please use this feedback form (39:37 - 39:42)
here's a link and send it in and that is (39:39 - 39:44)
that is you're gonna get the same people (39:42 - 39:46)
that tweet at you (39:44 - 39:49)
i don't think so i i i maybe but like i (39:46 - 39:52)
i feel like (39:49 - 39:52)
i feel like you you you don't (39:52 - 39:57)
um and as somebody who did work in (39:55 - 40:00)
customer service (39:57 - 40:00)
like when you're (40:00 - 40:04)
i would i would say that you obviously (40:02 - 40:06)
you still get like jerks and you still (40:04 - 40:09)
get people yelling at you but like (40:06 - 40:12)
in person conversations always went (40:09 - 40:15)
better than over the phone conversations (40:12 - 40:16)
like it seemed like in person (40:15 - 40:18)
conversations were like the most calm (40:16 - 40:20)
and collective and then it moved into (40:18 - 40:22)
like phone and then it moved into like (40:20 - 40:24)
like and i feel like twitter is at the (40:22 - 40:26)
very end of that like (40:24 - 40:28)
it's because of how humans can (40:26 - 40:32)
communicate 85 of how we communicate is (40:28 - 40:33)
through body language and facial (40:32 - 40:34)
expressions (40:33 - 40:37)
so when you cut that out the next (40:34 - 40:39)
largest chunk is tone of voice which is (40:37 - 40:41)
15 (40:39 - 40:43)
and then the last bit of how we (40:41 - 40:44)
communicate are the words we actually (40:43 - 40:47)
choose so written form across all (40:44 - 40:50)
mediums is always going to be the worst (40:47 - 40:53)
because that's not how we as humans (40:50 - 40:54)
communicate (40:53 - 40:57)
so in person is always going to be (40:54 - 40:58)
better because you can see their face (40:57 - 41:01)
you can read their body you can register (40:58 - 41:03)
what their emotions are you can see how (41:01 - 41:05)
angry they are how not angry they are (41:03 - 41:08)
body language is how we communicate so (41:05 - 41:10)
yeah taking that out (41:08 - 41:14)
is always bad like the fact that most of (41:10 - 41:16)
our social media is all written (41:14 - 41:19)
is bad the reason why tick tock is very (41:16 - 41:21)
successful because it makes videos is (41:19 - 41:23)
because people can see (41:21 - 41:25)
people and look at their face and read (41:23 - 41:28)
their faces and know what they mean (41:25 - 41:29)
like it is a fundamental problem of (41:28 - 41:32)
communication but i don't think that (41:29 - 41:34)
dissolves the responsibility of a (41:32 - 41:36)
corporation that has a product that has (41:34 - 41:38)
to answer all those channels no i mean (41:36 - 41:39)
they said (41:38 - 41:42)
they said they were reading every tweet (41:39 - 41:43)
i i i when they said that though i (41:42 - 41:45)
thought of like (41:43 - 41:47)
is it when you you know the whole like (41:45 - 41:49)
if you're mad at your politician don't (41:47 - 41:51)
call them write them a letter because (41:49 - 41:53)
they have to (41:51 - 41:55)
like look at and i was like is is this (41:53 - 41:57)
what the feedback form is like yeah the (41:55 - 41:58)
calling is twitter but like if you (41:57 - 42:00)
actually want niantic listen you gotta (41:58 - 42:02)
go to their form and fill it out i mean (42:00 - 42:04)
the the ration behind that to just to (42:02 - 42:07)
finish the logic behind why you would (42:04 - 42:09)
write your politician a physical letter (42:07 - 42:11)
it's because and this is something you (42:09 - 42:13)
bring up all the time (42:11 - 42:17)
you took the time to sit down and write (42:13 - 42:21)
a letter you must actually care versus (42:17 - 42:23)
sitting on the toilet while you poop and (42:21 - 42:25)
writing a tweet (42:23 - 42:27)
right yes (42:25 - 42:27)
and i'm assuming the people seem some (42:29 - 42:33)
real bad letters (42:31 - 42:36)
like let's feel real (42:33 - 42:38)
the only the only barrier of a letter is (42:36 - 42:39)
you have to put it in an envelope and (42:38 - 42:42)
then put a stamp on it that takes effort (42:39 - 42:44)
it takes way more effort than just log (42:42 - 42:46)
into your twitter that's for sure (42:44 - 42:48)
um (42:46 - 42:48)
i i kind of wish nick pushed harder on (42:50 - 42:56)
some things (42:54 - 42:59)
um (42:56 - 43:02)
but also i i would assume that even if (42:59 - 43:04)
they were more difficult questions (43:02 - 43:06)
kelsey was in a situation where they (43:04 - 43:09)
could only say so much right i mean so (43:06 - 43:10)
even operations (43:09 - 43:13)
pr people are tied to certain things and (43:10 - 43:16)
cannot go past them (43:13 - 43:16)
i don't know we can we can spend another (43:20 - 43:24)
hour on accessibility for (43:21 - 43:28)
for a pogo um (43:24 - 43:28)
i guess the takeaway is they (43:28 - 43:33)
acknowledged it finally (43:30 - 43:35)
uh which is a step (43:33 - 43:36)
uh (43:35 - 43:38)
it is a step that's for sure (43:36 - 43:40)
because because prior i mean like three (43:38 - 43:42)
weeks ago we said on the show like (43:40 - 43:44)
they don't even bring it up yeah i mean (43:42 - 43:45)
it is (43:44 - 43:47)
it is nice that they answered the (43:45 - 43:50)
question and it's not great that it was (43:47 - 43:51)
really corporate (43:50 - 43:56)
um and it is (43:51 - 43:56)
the amount of places that say oh it's a (43:57 - 44:02)
priority we're looking at it and then (44:00 - 44:04)
never do anything because they just said (44:02 - 44:05)
that to make people think that they're (44:04 - 44:08)
doing the work that then they never do (44:05 - 44:09)
like it's it's great that they (44:08 - 44:12)
acknowledge it but until they actually (44:09 - 44:14)
do something that doesn't mean anything (44:12 - 44:15)
yeah well i don't think anything's going (44:14 - 44:17)
to be done until all of all of gofest is (44:15 - 44:19)
over there's no way they're they're (44:17 - 44:21)
changing anything in their game during (44:19 - 44:23)
the the the three months that make them (44:21 - 44:26)
the most money (44:23 - 44:29)
like we are we are going to get (44:26 - 44:31)
like they revamped megas (44:29 - 44:34)
whatever they teased the other week (44:31 - 44:36)
that's supposed to come out relatively (44:34 - 44:37)
soon and then (44:36 - 44:40)
go fast go pesco fest (44:37 - 44:40)
and i'm assuming during that time (44:40 - 44:44)
they're like everyone's gonna be making (44:45 - 44:49)
sure that go fest isn't broken (44:46 - 44:50)
so they're not going to be working on (44:49 - 44:52)
anything else (44:50 - 44:53)
so if there is anything accessibility (44:52 - 44:54)
coming (44:53 - 44:56)
it probably won't even be till next year (44:54 - 44:58)
at this rate uh probably not (44:56 - 45:02)
but i mean that's sort of the problem is (44:58 - 45:03)
corporations can always come up with a (45:02 - 45:07)
reason why it's a back burner right (45:03 - 45:09)
and then like oh go fest is over oh (45:07 - 45:11)
we're heading into the holidays (45:09 - 45:14)
and we have a bunch of holiday issues (45:11 - 45:15)
that we have to deal with no god it's (45:14 - 45:17)
the new year and we have a whole bunch (45:15 - 45:18)
of things planned for new year and we (45:17 - 45:21)
have to plan out that summer stuff so (45:18 - 45:23)
once all that's done and then it's a (45:21 - 45:25)
never-ending cycle of always putting it (45:23 - 45:26)
off (45:25 - 45:29)
that's just the issue it's why it's like (45:26 - 45:30)
it's great to hear you address it but (45:29 - 45:34)
you actually have to do something (45:30 - 45:36)
because the words mean nothing (45:34 - 45:39)
hey they fixed mega evolution (45:36 - 45:41)
i mean how how many years have we had (45:39 - 45:43)
megas (45:41 - 45:46)
uh cash two i think two right (45:43 - 45:47)
yeah two seems right i mean they (45:46 - 45:49)
revamped the whole thing (45:47 - 45:52)
like like for uh all the like 20 minutes (45:49 - 45:53)
of complaining about niantic the new (45:52 - 45:55)
mega avalanche system is really great it (45:53 - 45:57)
is better it's way better like it is (45:55 - 45:59)
like i make it every day (45:57 - 46:03)
um like it was it feels you know (45:59 - 46:06)
it's it's solving the issue (46:03 - 46:08)
something else that wasn't the issue (46:06 - 46:10)
that people were wanting it's like how (46:08 - 46:11)
they ca you know they're trying to cure (46:10 - 46:12)
disease and they came up with a pill to (46:11 - 46:15)
get rid of restless leg syndrome like (46:12 - 46:17)
great we didn't need it (46:15 - 46:18)
like (46:17 - 46:20)
there's a few people that needed it but (46:18 - 46:24)
that wasn't what we were looking for (46:20 - 46:24)
those jokesters over at niantic they'll (46:25 - 46:30)
figure it out (46:28 - 46:30)
they just need a couple more million (46:31 - 46:34)
dollars from the summer to (46:32 - 46:36)
move on all right speaking of moving on (46:34 - 46:37)
let's take a break when we come back we (46:36 - 46:39)
got a bunch of tcg stuff to talk about (46:37 - 46:42)
and uh then we'll wrap up the show so (46:39 - 46:44)
we'll be right back (46:42 - 46:48)

looming in the background (49:18 - 49:23)
arceus v has been proven itself to be (49:20 - 49:26)
extremely useful in some of the top (49:23 - 49:28)
pokemon tcg decks thanks to its trinity (49:26 - 49:30)
charge attack (49:28 - 49:32)
this attack does not do any damage to (49:30 - 49:33)
your opponent but instead lets you (49:32 - 49:34)
search in your deck for up to three (49:33 - 49:36)
basic energy and attach them to your (49:34 - 49:38)
pokemon v in any way you would like it (49:36 - 49:40)

arceus four tcg booster packs and a code (49:48 - 49:56)
card for tcg online or tcg live which (49:51 - 49:57)
sorry to anyone who moved their (49:56 - 49:59)
collection over to that beta because it (49:57 - 50:00)
is (49:59 - 50:02)
apparently still not (50:00 - 50:03)
solid (50:02 - 50:05)
but (50:03 - 50:07)
who knows uh it could you know get (50:05 - 50:11)
updated and fix everything overnight (50:07 - 50:11)

individually yeah okay (50:56 - 51:01)
reminiscent of the pokemon go experience (50:59 - 51:03)
some pokemon appear to jump into the (51:01 - 51:05)
real world such as pikachu walking (51:03 - 51:07)
alongside its trainer snorlax snoozing (51:05 - 51:09)
on a porch in front of a house some (51:07 - 51:11)

connection to pokemon go such as the (51:11 - 51:14)
mythical pokemon meltan (51:12 - 51:16)

my birthday is coming up the real (54:14 - 54:18)
question (54:16 - 54:19)
is (54:18 - 54:22)
how much art was contributed by noted (54:19 - 54:24)
instagram (54:22 - 54:27)
live action pokemon photographer pokemon (54:24 - 54:29)
snaps for these cards (54:27 - 54:30)
um (54:29 - 54:32)
probably zero (54:30 - 54:35)
i'm out i'm out i'm out the one thing i (54:32 - 54:36)
asked for and they couldn't even come (54:35 - 54:38)
through with that (54:36 - 54:39)
the elite trainer box has been on (54:38 - 54:41)
pokemon center for over a week now it's (54:39 - 54:44)
still not sold out i i have a suspicion (54:41 - 54:47)
like like it is still pretty it is still (54:44 - 54:50)
decently hard to find pokemon cards is (54:47 - 54:52)
it on pre-order yes you can pre-order (54:50 - 54:55)
off pokemon center.com uh like i walked (54:52 - 54:57)
into a target two days ago completely (54:55 - 54:59)
sold out a week ago i walked into a (54:57 - 55:00)
target (54:59 - 55:01)
fully stocked like it's it's very (55:00 - 55:03)
hit-and-miss yeah it's very like like if (55:01 - 55:07)
you arrive on restock day good odds (55:03 - 55:10)
otherwise sold out at least in my area (55:07 - 55:12)
and i've heard from other people that (55:10 - 55:13)
like (55:12 - 55:17)
it's still a wasteland out there (55:13 - 55:17)
but they have reprinted uh darkness (55:19 - 55:22)
ablaze and they have reprinted vivid (55:21 - 55:24)
voltage i did walk into a store and they (55:22 - 55:26)
had a full shelf of darkness ablaze and (55:24 - 55:28)
i was like whoa like i haven't seen (55:26 - 55:30)
darkness ablaze before like (55:28 - 55:32)
the paint like like literally the the (55:30 - 55:33)
week of the pandemic starting was like (55:32 - 55:35)
the last time i saw darkness of the (55:33 - 55:36)
blaze (55:35 - 55:38)
um (55:36 - 55:40)
it's it's okay so two things number one (55:38 - 55:42)
is i think they're gonna print this (55:40 - 55:45)
pokemon go set to the moon (55:42 - 55:47)
i don't know yeah yeah i think like they (55:45 - 55:49)
don't care (55:47 - 55:51)
for the most part i don't think they (55:49 - 55:52)
care about like resale value of cards (55:51 - 55:54)
like who cares if a charizard's eight (55:52 - 55:56)
hundred dollars they they're they're (55:54 - 55:57)
never going to see that money no (55:56 - 55:58)
companies everything care about the (55:57 - 55:59)
secondary market (55:58 - 56:00)
right (55:59 - 56:02)
like they'll want to do things to (56:00 - 56:04)
secretly kill the secondary rocket but (56:02 - 56:05)
they don't care (56:04 - 56:07)
like so how much the car is going let me (56:05 - 56:09)
just tell you something that there are (56:07 - 56:14)
some tcg player folks out there who are (56:09 - 56:17)
adamant that companies are like (56:14 - 56:19)
very invested in the secondary market (56:17 - 56:22)
because they believe like that 400 (56:19 - 56:26)
charizard is driving more people to buy (56:22 - 56:28)
cards oh (56:26 - 56:30)
it's like a very tinfoil hat theory (56:28 - 56:32)
which is 10 (56:30 - 56:35)
if i don't have any interest in (56:32 - 56:38)
buying pokemon cards to start out with (56:35 - 56:41)
seeing a 400 charizard does not move the (56:38 - 56:43)
needle it's not making and i would say (56:41 - 56:45)
for the majority of people out there who (56:43 - 56:47)
are not trading card game players (56:45 - 56:49)
you're not going to draw them into this (56:47 - 56:51)
market (56:49 - 56:53)
it's like it's it's a very small amount (56:51 - 56:56)
of people who would be motivated by that (56:53 - 56:57)
he (56:56 - 56:59)
he here's a fun story (56:57 - 57:01)
in 2016 (56:59 - 57:03)
we got pokemon sun and we got pokemon (57:01 - 57:05)
moon right and we also had the year of (57:03 - 57:08)
mythical we also had like all the anime (57:05 - 57:11)
coming to uh twitch you could watch the (57:08 - 57:13)
animant which we had a bunch of other (57:11 - 57:15)
things happening in 2006 (57:13 - 57:17)
uh 16 (57:15 - 57:18)
2000 (57:17 - 57:20)
2016. (57:18 - 57:21)
we also had (57:20 - 57:24)
a game released in 2016 called pokemon (57:21 - 57:25)
go (57:24 - 57:28)
uh which obviously got a lot of people (57:25 - 57:30)
back into pokemon (57:28 - 57:33)
it was a huge success for pokemon in (57:30 - 57:35)
general (57:33 - 57:36)
and (57:35 - 57:38)
to take advantage of that there was a (57:36 - 57:43)
tcg set called xy evolutions (57:38 - 57:44)
and (57:43 - 57:47)
the xy evolutions had like six different (57:44 - 57:51)
charizards in it like four blastoise (57:47 - 57:55)
four venusaurs 300 pikachus it had a (57:51 - 57:57)
bunch of different cards (57:55 - 57:59)
uh and a lot of these and these cards (57:57 - 58:01)
were based off of (57:59 - 58:03)
um (58:01 - 58:05)
like the the original base set like oh (58:03 - 58:07)
you can get a base set (58:05 - 58:09)
xy evolution charizard you can get like (58:07 - 58:12)
mega charizard whatever (58:09 - 58:15)
and they printed this set to the moon (58:12 - 58:18)
it was the most printed pokemon tcg set (58:15 - 58:20)
of all time (58:18 - 58:21)
and (58:20 - 58:24)
in a sense it ultimately flopped (58:21 - 58:27)
pokemon go players (58:24 - 58:30)
while some did like decide at target you (58:27 - 58:31)
know right before checkout to pick up a (58:30 - 58:33)
pack of pokemon cards because they're (58:31 - 58:35)
playing pokemon go (58:33 - 58:37)
this set was dead in the water (58:35 - 58:40)
you couldn't buy any future set without (58:37 - 58:43)
being like oh they they stuck in two xy (58:40 - 58:46)
evolutions in this pack great like (58:43 - 58:48)
garb like pure garbage like there's (58:46 - 58:52)
nothing in these packs i care about and (58:48 - 58:53)
it wasn't until (58:52 - 58:57)
the youtube boom slash kovid sitting at (58:53 - 58:59)
home what should we spend our money on (58:57 - 59:01)
get into break boxes (58:59 - 59:04)
of pokemon cards which we've talked (59:01 - 59:08)
about extensively and xy evolutions went (59:04 - 59:09)
through the roof (59:08 - 59:11)
of like suddenly being worth (59:09 - 59:13)
money because (59:11 - 59:15)
people because (59:13 - 59:17)
for the same reason crimson invasion (59:15 - 59:19)
went up in value even though crimson (59:17 - 59:22)
invasion is a significantly more worse (59:19 - 59:24)
significantly worse set than xy (59:22 - 59:26)
evolutions like people were just so (59:24 - 59:28)
desperate for any packs that had (59:26 - 59:31)
charizard in any packs in general (59:28 - 59:33)
that these cards went up (59:31 - 59:34)
um (59:33 - 59:37)
that being said (59:34 - 59:37)
i think they're printing this set to the (59:40 - 59:43)
moon (59:42 - 59:45)
because they don't want (59:43 - 59:48)
the drought two things they don't want (59:45 - 59:50)
the drought thing to happen again (59:48 - 59:52)
because i think this time they can (59:50 - 59:54)
successfully capture that audience they (59:52 - 59:57)
wanted to capture back in 2016 by (59:54 - 60:00)
pokemon go branding these cards and (59:57 - 60:03)
number two is they are (60:00 - 60:05)
they there is a time sensitivity on (60:03 - 60:09)
pokemon cards people want the new stuff (60:05 - 60:11)
people want to go into the store and get (60:09 - 60:12)
the new stuff (60:11 - 60:15)
where as like (60:12 - 60:17)
without this weird secondary market that (60:15 - 60:19)
drove cards up when i went into the (60:17 - 60:21)
store and i was like (60:19 - 60:23)
xy evolutions was on shelves (60:21 - 60:27)
for almost five years from 2016 until (60:23 - 60:30)
the start of the pandemic xy evolutions (60:27 - 60:32)
sat on shelves (60:30 - 60:35)
because no one wanted it because it was (60:32 - 60:37)
bad and it's still bad (60:35 - 60:38)
so (60:37 - 60:39)
they're going to print the set to the (60:38 - 60:42)
moon make sure it's on shelves because (60:39 - 60:44)
this summer people are going to be (60:42 - 60:46)
playing a lot of pokemon go they're (60:44 - 60:48)
going to buy it and then it will (60:46 - 60:50)
continue to sit on shelves but they will (60:48 - 60:53)
at least make their initial money (60:50 - 60:53)
on a whole other topic (60:56 - 61:00)
i am so glad they're reprinting vivid (60:58 - 61:03)
voltage and darkness ablaze because they (61:00 - 61:05)
did (61:03 - 61:07)
they were incredibly hard to find when (61:05 - 61:10)
they came out because people were just (61:07 - 61:12)
buying and there is this weird thing now (61:10 - 61:14)
and i don't know if this exists in (61:12 - 61:16)
sports cards or base like (61:14 - 61:18)
other mark or i don't think this exists (61:16 - 61:20)
in magic either but there's this weird (61:18 - 61:22)
thing and i've seen it on tick tock and (61:20 - 61:23)
i've seen it on twitter and i've seen it (61:22 - 61:26)
on youtube where people have (61:23 - 61:29)
rooms full of (61:26 - 61:32)
like vivid voltage or evolving skies or (61:29 - 61:36)
whatever like name a tcg pokemon set and (61:32 - 61:38)
they have just boxes to the ceiling they (61:36 - 61:41)
have that in magic but it's the early (61:38 - 61:44)
90s sets alpha beta those ones and and (61:41 - 61:46)
so they walk into this room of like (61:44 - 61:48)
vivid voltage and they're like this is (61:46 - 61:50)
my investment (61:48 - 61:52)
and now these people are panicking (61:50 - 61:54)
because the pokemon company is (61:52 - 61:58)
reprinting these sets finally (61:54 - 62:00)
because (61:58 - 62:02)
people don't have them like it was it (62:00 - 62:04)
was really hard for the last two years (62:02 - 62:07)
to get vivid voltage and vivid voltage (62:04 - 62:09)
is a pretty good set not only like there (62:07 - 62:11)
are fun cards to collect there's the the (62:09 - 62:12)
rainbow pikachu (62:11 - 62:15)
um there's cards that you can use (62:12 - 62:17)
competitively like it is a fun set it's (62:15 - 62:19)
it's kind of a large set but it's a (62:17 - 62:21)
relatively fun set to open (62:19 - 62:22)
um (62:21 - 62:24)
and it's just like (62:22 - 62:26)
i don't know i guess i'm in the camp of (62:24 - 62:27)
like (62:26 - 62:30)
pokemon cards are not an investment like (62:27 - 62:32)
it just reminds me of a very 90s issue (62:30 - 62:34)
where my parents i've watched my parents (62:32 - 62:35)
do this where they were like buying (62:34 - 62:36)
beanie babies and they were like these (62:35 - 62:38)
beanie babies are gonna put you through (62:36 - 62:40)
college i re we make the joke all the (62:38 - 62:43)
time where like we went i was a kid you (62:40 - 62:45)
guys were adults but you we went to go (62:43 - 62:47)
see the first pokemon movie and they (62:45 - 62:48)
handed you the ancient mew and my (62:47 - 62:51)
parents legitimately said it's not a (62:48 - 62:52)
like we joke about it but it's not a (62:51 - 62:54)
joke my parents legitimately said i (62:52 - 62:56)
could not open the wrapper of this (62:54 - 62:58)
ancient mew because it would devalue it (62:56 - 63:01)
and this card would be worth hundreds (62:58 - 63:03)
and i could use it for college and the (63:01 - 63:05)
joke is that ancient me was worth six (63:03 - 63:09)
dollars sealed uh on tcg player the (63:05 - 63:11)
thing is is like (63:09 - 63:14)
it came from the 90s where suddenly a (63:11 - 63:15)
lot of things (63:14 - 63:18)
we're selling for vast amounts of money (63:15 - 63:21)
well a lot of things from the 50s and (63:18 - 63:24)
60s which was boomer and nostalgia at (63:21 - 63:25)
that time (63:24 - 63:28)
became very expensive and so (63:25 - 63:30)
the boomer parents who were the parents (63:28 - 63:32)
at that time said oh this will also (63:30 - 63:35)
repeat for my children which was a huge (63:32 - 63:36)
error which was a big error because it (63:35 - 63:39)
was a one-time only thing but like (63:36 - 63:41)
we'd laugh about it but that was a huge (63:39 - 63:43)
thing it was like (63:41 - 63:45)
comic books were like we're putting out (63:43 - 63:47)
five rare variant covers and these will (63:45 - 63:50)
go up in value because like it was a (63:47 - 63:52)
selling point of almost every (63:50 - 63:53)
collectible (63:52 - 63:57)
because it happened once so therefore it (63:53 - 64:01)
would happen again and (63:57 - 64:02)
most people (64:01 - 64:04)
didn't sort of look at it and say oh (64:02 - 64:06)
this is just a marketing scheme to make (64:04 - 64:08)
you buy stuff that's going to be useless (64:06 - 64:11)
and and also without the skeptical (64:08 - 64:13)
understanding that those things in the (64:11 - 64:17)
50s and 60s became valuable because (64:13 - 64:20)
you know marvel and dc at that time (64:17 - 64:23)
were relatively small companies and (64:20 - 64:26)
maybe they printed 5 000 issues of a (64:23 - 64:28)
comic and they're like well you know (64:26 - 64:29)
we've got to make our money right in the (64:28 - 64:33)
90s they were like we know if we put (64:29 - 64:35)
wolverine on the cover of a book (64:33 - 64:38)
it's going to sell like hotcakes and (64:35 - 64:40)
we're going to do 20 000 prints of it (64:38 - 64:42)
because we know we'll sell that money (64:40 - 64:44)
and they'll never have any future value (64:42 - 64:46)
right but also (64:44 - 64:49)
there wasn't a collector's mindset (64:46 - 64:51)
i mean you have to have people who are (64:49 - 64:53)
willing to destroy their product so the (64:51 - 64:56)
ones that they do have are rare and when (64:53 - 64:57)
the 90s hit and all these things people (64:56 - 64:59)
are like put your wheaties into a (64:57 - 65:02)
plastic container and save it forever (64:59 - 65:04)
like the collector mindset hit the (65:02 - 65:06)
public and then people (65:04 - 65:08)
stopped sort of realizing that the the (65:06 - 65:10)
reason why these are expensive is (65:08 - 65:12)
because of scarcity (65:10 - 65:15)
like if one person (65:12 - 65:17)
had ancient mew (65:15 - 65:19)
and only one person had ancient mu that (65:17 - 65:22)
would be worth something but every kid (65:19 - 65:24)
was like my parents said to keep it (65:22 - 65:27)
perfect so i did (65:24 - 65:29)
and now there's a million of them and (65:27 - 65:31)
it's not rare (65:29 - 65:32)
yeah so (65:31 - 65:34)
going back to vivid voltage which (65:32 - 65:36)
you know people like i open pokemon (65:34 - 65:39)
cards on stream all the time um and and (65:36 - 65:41)
people will say like hey i'm getting (65:39 - 65:43)
into pokemon cards like what what should (65:41 - 65:44)
i open (65:43 - 65:45)
and (65:44 - 65:47)
you know that changes over time like (65:45 - 65:50)
like when when battle styles was new it (65:47 - 65:51)
was like oh you should get battle styles (65:50 - 65:53)
it's the newest set but now if somebody (65:51 - 65:54)
was like should i get battle styles like (65:53 - 65:57)
no battle styles is like there's nothing (65:54 - 65:58)
really great in battle styles it's like (65:57 - 66:00)
a really loaded set there's not a lot of (65:58 - 66:02)
fun cards there are sets that are are a (66:00 - 66:04)
million percent more fun to open than (66:02 - 66:06)
others a fusion strike not fun to open (66:04 - 66:08)
it's just way too big it's way too (66:06 - 66:08)
bloated (66:08 - 66:10)
brilliant stars (66:08 - 66:13)
great to open right now i don't know if (66:10 - 66:15)
in a year i could say that brilliant (66:13 - 66:17)
stars is still great or fun to open but (66:15 - 66:19)
like as of this recording right now like (66:17 - 66:21)
if you want to get into cards if you (66:19 - 66:24)
find brilliant stars worth buying worth (66:21 - 66:26)
opening in my opinion (66:24 - 66:29)
vivid voltage at the time was incredibly (66:26 - 66:32)
excited like vivid voltage was the last (66:29 - 66:33)
set (66:32 - 66:34)
before (66:33 - 66:36)
pandemic (66:34 - 66:39)
and it was though the chase card the the (66:36 - 66:42)
go-to card in vivid voltage was was (66:39 - 66:45)
pikachu v-max rainbow rare just this (66:42 - 66:47)
real big chunky pikachu (66:45 - 66:51)
lgbt doubt very very great love it very (66:47 - 66:53)
cute on a gorgeous card (66:51 - 66:56)
and because vivid voltage was so hard to (66:53 - 66:57)
find (66:56 - 66:59)
and because their (66:57 - 67:01)
people were hoarding (66:59 - 67:04)
vivid voltage this like no joke the (67:01 - 67:07)
price of pikachu vmax was 400 (67:04 - 67:10)
if you wanted to go on ebay or tcgplayer (67:07 - 67:11)
as of june (67:10 - 67:15)
of 2021 so about a year ago (67:11 - 67:17)
pikachu v-max was (67:15 - 67:20)
336 dollars (67:17 - 67:22)
and (67:20 - 67:25)
as of um (67:22 - 67:28)
at the start of this year january of (67:25 - 67:32)
2022 pikachu v-max dropped to (67:28 - 67:34)
155 dollars (67:32 - 67:35)
and (67:34 - 67:38)
as of two weeks ago (67:35 - 67:41)
vivid voltage is now on shelves again (67:38 - 67:44)
being reprinted there is (67:41 - 67:46)
zero way (67:44 - 67:50)
it's impossible for pikachu v-max to (67:46 - 67:53)
ever get to 400 again (67:50 - 67:55)
i i it probably won't even get back to (67:53 - 67:57)
150 (67:55 - 68:01)
it will because more will be out there (67:57 - 68:05)
and all of these collectors or investors (68:01 - 68:06)
i should say (68:05 - 68:07)
that are sitting on (68:06 - 68:09)
vivid voltage (68:07 - 68:12)
like maybe (68:09 - 68:14)
in 20 years (68:12 - 68:16)
your vivid voltage will be as worth as (68:14 - 68:20)
much as original base set was worth 20 (68:16 - 68:22)
years ago (68:20 - 68:26)
maybe maybe but that's a huge gamble to (68:22 - 68:26)
like (68:26 - 68:29)
spend a hundred dollars on (68:26 - 68:31)
well they have they have multiple but if (68:29 - 68:33)
you bought one (68:31 - 68:36)
booster box of vivid voltage for 150 (68:33 - 68:40)
and you sat on it for 20 years (68:36 - 68:40)
i don't know you're probably better off (68:40 - 68:44)
putting that 150 into like a cd or (68:41 - 68:46)
something like (68:44 - 68:48)
something that has guaranteed returns (68:46 - 68:49)
certificate of a deposit you don't you (68:48 - 68:52)
mean not a musical album (68:49 - 68:54)
right right yeah (68:52 - 68:55)
i mean (68:54 - 68:58)
put it into cds too those those will (68:55 - 69:00)
come back (68:58 - 69:00)
like the only reason like ph2 vmax was (69:00 - 69:04)
400 (69:03 - 69:07)
a year ago is because (69:04 - 69:08)
there's just not that many out there (69:07 - 69:10)
right because they're sitting they're (69:08 - 69:12)
sitting in boxes and somebody's (69:10 - 69:14)
abandoned office (69:12 - 69:15)
and now (69:14 - 69:17)
and now people are going to be opening (69:15 - 69:18)
them and (69:17 - 69:20)
you know i mean like people will still (69:18 - 69:21)
be selling them people will still be (69:20 - 69:23)
trading them but there will just be more (69:21 - 69:25)
out there (69:23 - 69:26)
it's the same as all these people buying (69:25 - 69:28)
up houses that they don't need what is (69:26 - 69:30)
wrong with you people (69:28 - 69:33)
mean (69:30 - 69:33)
buy pokemon cards because you like poke (69:35 - 69:38)
i mean whatever if you if if pokemon (69:36 - 69:41)
cards is your investment (69:38 - 69:42)
i don't know if we can be friends but (69:41 - 69:44)
you know (69:42 - 69:46)
i i will say this i (69:44 - 69:50)
found a tick tock of a person who (69:46 - 69:51)
collects (69:50 - 69:54)
all old (69:51 - 69:56)
pokemon stuff (69:54 - 70:00)
and they bought the pikachu (69:56 - 70:04)
uh vw bug and then they bought the lugia (70:00 - 70:06)
pt cruiser and they're restoring them (70:04 - 70:08)
and i'm very envious (70:06 - 70:10)
i don't like either of those cars that (70:08 - 70:11)
much but just the fact that they have (70:10 - 70:12)
them (70:11 - 70:15)
makes me envy that whole you don't have (70:12 - 70:15)
them (70:15 - 70:17)
will moved (70:15 - 70:21)
probably eight different totes in my (70:17 - 70:23)
house to minnesota from milwaukee to (70:21 - 70:25)
minnesota and in those totes were of so (70:23 - 70:29)
many different sealed pokemon items and (70:25 - 70:31)
stop calling those totes you're (70:29 - 70:33)
confusing people (70:31 - 70:35)
plastic boxes (70:33 - 70:39)
bins plastic bins totes are the bags (70:35 - 70:41)
that pbs gives you when you give a (70:39 - 70:44)
donation yeah all right there's a size (70:41 - 70:48)
difference here of magnitude (70:44 - 70:48)
and honestly i don't think that any of (70:48 - 70:52)
that stuff is worth it i have a i have a (70:50 - 70:55)
booster box of xy evolutions (70:52 - 70:57)
uh i don't i don't know how much it's (70:55 - 71:00)
worth but i'm gonna i'll tell you what (70:57 - 71:01)
it's probably not gonna be worth a lot (71:00 - 71:04)
in 20 years (71:01 - 71:04)
like (71:04 - 71:08)
i don't know (71:06 - 71:10)
like things are not (71:08 - 71:13)
the thing to me you can't say like this (71:10 - 71:16)
card is worth 400 (71:13 - 71:17)
and then refuse to sell it it's not (71:16 - 71:19)
worth anything then (71:17 - 71:21)
if if you're not if you're not going to (71:19 - 71:22)
sell it (71:21 - 71:24)
and you have no intention of selling it (71:22 - 71:27)
it's not worth anything (71:24 - 71:29)
yeah that's true i have in my collection (71:27 - 71:30)
i have (71:29 - 71:33)
magic cards that are worth over a (71:30 - 71:36)
hundred dollars and i i want them to (71:33 - 71:38)
play with them so they actually have (71:36 - 71:41)
zero value they have a zero value or (71:38 - 71:44)
it's like i pulled a relatively pricey (71:41 - 71:46)
card recently and i was like oh greg can (71:44 - 71:48)
use this card and you know what it has (71:46 - 71:49)
zero value because i'm just gonna bring (71:48 - 71:53)
it to greg and be like here have this (71:49 - 71:55)
uh well we are making a we are making a (71:53 - 71:58)
trade foreign we are actually trading (71:55 - 72:00)
trading credit credit cards (71:58 - 72:04)
oh people doing that still yeah (72:00 - 72:06)
dang i don't know people actually traded (72:04 - 72:09)
trading cards trading (72:06 - 72:09)
real talk (72:16 - 72:19)
and this is the real where value comes (72:17 - 72:21)
into it because here's something that (72:19 - 72:23)
has value to nobody but does have value (72:21 - 72:26)
to me if anybody has a complete playset (72:23 - 72:28)
of every my little pony trading card (72:26 - 72:31)

anime spoiler so if you are not caught (73:43 - 73:48)
up on pokemon journeys (73:45 - 73:51)
uh maybe like look at the timestamps and (73:48 - 73:52)
skip this (73:51 - 73:54)
it's technically (73:52 - 73:55)
an if (73:54 - 73:59)
technically the pokemon japanese twitter (73:55 - 74:01)
tweeted it so like (73:59 - 74:04)
it's not really a spoiler but also (74:01 - 74:08)
america is like 50 episodes behind japan (74:04 - 74:10)
but like it is from an official pokemon (74:08 - 74:11)
source (74:10 - 74:14)
they revealed here's your spoiler they (74:11 - 74:16)

eight (74:16 - 74:19)
trainers who are competing in the (74:17 - 74:23)
pokemon world coronation series (74:19 - 74:23)
because the anime is about ash spoiler (74:23 - 74:28)
ash is one of those eight people we're (74:26 - 74:30)
gonna go through the eight people here (74:28 - 74:33)
yeah cause one of them i don't recognize (74:30 - 74:35)
oh okay i can answer these questions (74:33 - 74:36)
okay so we have (74:35 - 74:38)
uh (74:36 - 74:38)
i'll i'll go from oldest generation to (74:39 - 74:43)
new okay so we got ash being featured (74:41 - 74:46)
with his pikachu we have lose look at (74:43 - 74:48)
this lineup he's gonna lose we have (74:46 - 74:51)
lance being featured with his uh shiny (74:48 - 74:53)
gyarados that he got from the lake of (74:51 - 74:54)
rage (74:53 - 74:56)
i believe the next person in line would (74:54 - 74:58)
be stephen (74:56 - 75:02)
with his shiny metagross (74:58 - 75:04)
i don't remember stephen having shiny (75:02 - 75:06)
metagross in (75:04 - 75:08)
in the games he does not correct no he (75:06 - 75:09)
doesn't but i'm pretty sure he has it in (75:08 - 75:11)
the enemy in the anime he's always had (75:09 - 75:13)
it in the end of the enemy yeah (75:11 - 75:17)
um and then we have uh cynthia with her (75:13 - 75:18)
garchomp (75:17 - 75:20)
then we have (75:18 - 75:24)
iris with her haxorus ash did beat iris (75:20 - 75:25)
initially (75:24 - 75:26)
um (75:25 - 75:28)
and then we have (75:26 - 75:30)
diantha with her gardevoir obviously (75:28 - 75:32)
mega gardevoir (75:30 - 75:35)
stephen i believe mega metagross by the (75:32 - 75:37)
way uh and then we have (75:35 - 75:41)
elaine elan i think it's elan (75:37 - 75:42)
uh (75:41 - 75:44)
with his mega charizard and then we have (75:42 - 75:47)
leon with his dynomax charizard you're (75:44 - 75:49)
probably like who is alan yeah i don't (75:47 - 75:51)
remember that character so alan is the (75:49 - 75:54)
person who beat ash in the xy series (75:51 - 75:56)
with (75:54 - 75:58)
he beat ash greninja and that's why (75:56 - 76:01)
people were so upset because they (75:58 - 76:04)
thought ash should have won that series (76:01 - 76:06)
i never saw the end of that series (76:04 - 76:09)
that's why (76:06 - 76:11)
yeah it was like the closest that ash (76:09 - 76:13)
had ever come to winning and then (76:11 - 76:15)
they still took it from him (76:13 - 76:17)
people were also upset because they they (76:15 - 76:20)
thought that ash had the best team he's (76:17 - 76:23)
ever had they were upset that (76:20 - 76:25)
charizard was fire type and greninja was (76:23 - 76:28)
water type (76:25 - 76:28)
look ash can never win (76:33 - 76:37)
he did win that i know but that was the (76:35 - 76:39)
old thing ash could never win because (76:37 - 76:43)
then the series would be done (76:39 - 76:43)
um i don't remember what else was on (76:43 - 76:48)
alan's team here so he has he has the (76:45 - 76:51)
mega charizard he has the uh (76:48 - 76:53)
x (76:51 - 76:55)
he has metagross he has tyranitar he has (76:53 - 76:57)
we vile he has bisharp he has (76:55 - 76:59)
and he has unpheasant that is that is (76:57 - 77:03)
his team as of uh xy (76:59 - 77:03)
uh i think (77:04 - 77:11)
i i i'm curious if they're (77:07 - 77:11)
i'm always curious with any type of (77:12 - 77:17)
television show i don't know why i said (77:15 - 77:20)
television so funny (77:17 - 77:20)
how long they plan out stuff (77:21 - 77:27)
like when they were when they made the (77:25 - 77:29)
decision that ash was going to lose to (77:27 - 77:31)
alan (77:29 - 77:33)
were they thinking like he's going to (77:31 - 77:35)
lose to alan but we know alan is coming (77:33 - 77:39)
back and we want that rematch (77:35 - 77:41)
oh there's no way to tell yeah i mean (77:39 - 77:43)
it's hard to say so (77:41 - 77:46)
most things don't (77:43 - 77:48)
plan out more than a year because it's a (77:46 - 77:51)
lot of wasted time but they probably (77:48 - 77:53)
write out rough sketches (77:51 - 77:54)
like (77:53 - 77:58)
when they're probably writing the uh (77:54 - 78:00)
ending where elon wins they were (77:58 - 78:03)
probably had like a note you know (78:00 - 78:05)
use this character rematch would be good (78:03 - 78:07)
and that might be the the end of what (78:05 - 78:09)
they wrote and then (78:07 - 78:10)
when they came up with the idea of the (78:09 - 78:13)
world champion or the word cornet series (78:10 - 78:15)
like oh let's bring it back here we have (78:13 - 78:16)
this character (78:15 - 78:19)
we can bring it back but usually (78:16 - 78:23)
storyboarding out more than a couple of (78:19 - 78:24)
years is is (78:23 - 78:26)
a lot of wasted effort especially if new (78:24 - 78:28)
games are coming out and popularity (78:26 - 78:30)
things change the show might get (78:28 - 78:32)
cancelled yeah like why would you waste (78:30 - 78:33)
your time on episodes that are never (78:32 - 78:35)
going to get made (78:33 - 78:38)
yeah at most they do probably i would (78:35 - 78:40)
say at best they would storyboard out (78:38 - 78:43)
three years but it's probably two years (78:40 - 78:45)
max (78:43 - 78:45)
yeah i mean like i think i think (78:47 - 78:50)
journeys is really great (78:48 - 78:53)
dirty has been a lot of fun i i think (78:50 - 78:56)
ash's team is really great in journeys (78:53 - 78:57)
um (78:56 - 78:59)
i think the battles in journeys is (78:57 - 79:02)
really great the dynamic between go and (78:59 - 79:04)
ash (79:02 - 79:06)
um (79:04 - 79:07)
like go focusing on catching and ash (79:06 - 79:09)
focusing on battles is like really (79:07 - 79:11)
really nice i can't remember that girl's (79:09 - 79:14)
name she's great too uh chloe chloe (79:11 - 79:16)
that girl that girl what's that girl's (79:14 - 79:17)
name (79:16 - 79:18)
chloe's okay (79:17 - 79:21)
um (79:18 - 79:22)
her episodes for me are very hit and (79:21 - 79:25)
miss um but i know people really like (79:22 - 79:27)
chloe a lot (79:25 - 79:28)
i (79:27 - 79:30)
okay so there there's eight trainers (79:28 - 79:31)
here (79:30 - 79:33)
a lot of champions (79:31 - 79:35)
well i guess alan is a champion he like (79:33 - 79:39)
he won the he won the xy league he he is (79:35 - 79:42)
a champion um (79:39 - 79:42)
who is the champion in xy that you (79:43 - 79:46)
defeat (79:45 - 79:48)
dianthus santa (79:46 - 79:50)
that's right but everything i think she (79:48 - 79:52)
was in a different series (79:50 - 79:55)
there's no there's no way (79:52 - 79:57)
that ash doesn't battle elan again like (79:55 - 79:59)
when they when they like (79:57 - 80:01)
when they line these matches up like (79:59 - 80:03)
does ash really need to battle (80:01 - 80:05)
um iris again (80:03 - 80:07)
no but does it have to be (80:05 - 80:09)
it's good does ash need to battle lance (80:07 - 80:12)
again no no i don't think so it's gonna (80:09 - 80:15)
be lance versus iris (80:12 - 80:19)
dragon vs dragon yeah (80:15 - 80:21)
and it's gonna be (80:19 - 80:22)
uh (80:21 - 80:24)
cynthia versus (80:22 - 80:27)
stephen (80:24 - 80:28)
okay so there was so you didn't watch x (80:27 - 80:32)
and y there was a match between stephen (80:28 - 80:33)
and elon (80:32 - 80:35)
finnish okay there was a match between (80:33 - 80:37)
stephen and elan (80:35 - 80:39)
and that match got interrupted because (80:37 - 80:43)
of lysander so that match never finished (80:39 - 80:45)
uh and there was another match between (80:43 - 80:47)
diantha and (80:45 - 80:49)
steven i think and i don't think that (80:47 - 80:52)
match finished either i don't remember (80:49 - 80:52)
so (80:52 - 80:55)
again there's no way that ash and elon (80:52 - 80:56)
don't fight each other and then so (80:55 - 80:59)
what's the situation does ash finally (80:56 - 81:02)
beat elan and people feel vindicated or (80:59 - 81:05)
does elon beat ash again and it's just (81:02 - 81:07)
that do you know the writers are (81:05 - 81:09)
listening right now and having heard you (81:07 - 81:11)
say that they're saying we are we got to (81:09 - 81:12)
make sure that ash and allah do not (81:11 - 81:13)
here's the question (81:12 - 81:16)
is leon (81:13 - 81:17)
going to be going up through the ranks (81:16 - 81:19)
or is it is that they're all fighting to (81:17 - 81:21)
fight leon and leah doesn't do anything (81:19 - 81:23)
until the end because no leo (81:21 - 81:25)
it's a bracket leon's part of the eight (81:23 - 81:27)
so then it's gonna be charizard versus (81:25 - 81:29)
charizard (81:27 - 81:30)
at some point right (81:29 - 81:33)
but when when i don't (81:30 - 81:35)
do they normally i guess well yeah they (81:33 - 81:37)
they've showed stephen versus elon like (81:35 - 81:39)
i don't know if they end that series (81:37 - 81:41)
with elan versus (81:39 - 81:43)
leon (81:41 - 81:44)
no they're gonna end they're gonna end (81:43 - 81:46)
it with ash horses because when ashe (81:44 - 81:48)
loses black and white when he loses to (81:46 - 81:50)
beyblade they like they were like a (81:48 - 81:52)
tournament's over (81:50 - 81:53)
somebody won but we're not gonna show (81:52 - 81:54)
you the matches (81:53 - 81:58)
right no i mean it's going to end up as (81:54 - 82:00)
ash versus leon like we know that's (81:58 - 82:04)
going to end up so the question is is (82:00 - 82:06)
do they do a rematch and since they are (82:04 - 82:07)
probably going to do your answer most (82:06 - 82:09)
likely ash will win so they can do the (82:07 - 82:13)
final thing of ash versus leon (82:09 - 82:15)
and then leon wins (82:13 - 82:17)
absolutely leon wins i don't i don't (82:15 - 82:18)
think i don't think they give ash two (82:17 - 82:21)
victories in a row no (82:18 - 82:22)
they gave him (82:21 - 82:24)
his sunday moon victory is really well (82:22 - 82:25)
earned and i the people that are like (82:24 - 82:28)
well he had a torah cat like stop like (82:25 - 82:29)
clefairy has like won world (82:28 - 82:31)
championships like (82:29 - 82:34)
pacharisu has won world championships (82:31 - 82:36)
zig zagoon in the tcg has won (82:34 - 82:38)
championships like star (82:36 - 82:42)
anime rules and plot armor and plot (82:38 - 82:44)
weapons exist (82:42 - 82:44)
because i have a feeling it would the (82:50 - 82:54)
opening bracket would be lance versus (82:52 - 82:56)
iris (82:54 - 82:59)
diantha versus (82:56 - 83:02)
cynthia i see diantha versus iris and (82:59 - 83:03)
then diantha brings out a fairy which (83:02 - 83:07)
iris is not prepared for (83:03 - 83:07)
i feel like cynthia versus iris is (83:10 - 83:13)
probably what they do (83:12 - 83:17)
why are you so dragon vs dragon dude (83:13 - 83:19)
why is that entertaining to you is it (83:17 - 83:21)
not is it not stephen versus diantha is (83:19 - 83:23)
that not a match they do (83:21 - 83:25)
i mean that's that would be a good fairy (83:23 - 83:27)
versus dragon sure fairy versus no no (83:25 - 83:31)
very versatile versus steel oh okay (83:27 - 83:34)
hey i mean this is a bracket right it's (83:31 - 83:36)
a bracket of eight so (83:34 - 83:38)
four (83:36 - 83:40)
so ash has to battle two people before (83:38 - 83:42)
champion so like the two people ash (83:40 - 83:44)
battles like i don't know who like (83:42 - 83:46)
el alan is one i don't know who the (83:44 - 83:48)
other one is but it's obviously leon (83:46 - 83:50)
leon's on one side of the bracket ash is (83:48 - 83:53)
on the other side yes on the other (83:50 - 83:55)
so like (83:53 - 83:57)
who like who on on this thing is the (83:55 - 83:59)
person people want to see ash battle the (83:57 - 84:02)
most probably not iris and probably not (83:59 - 84:04)
lance it would either have to be (84:02 - 84:06)
dianthus cynthia or stephen probably (84:04 - 84:09)
cynthia cynthia is a big draw (84:06 - 84:10)
yeah (84:09 - 84:12)
this to me like looking at this eight is (84:10 - 84:14)
very (84:12 - 84:17)
very wrestling infused of like seeing (84:14 - 84:19)
these brackets and being like i finally (84:17 - 84:20)
get to see because they do this in (84:19 - 84:22)
wrestling where they they tease like two (84:20 - 84:25)
wrestlers not actually wrestling for a (84:22 - 84:26)
year (84:25 - 84:28)
and then they'll like give you that (84:26 - 84:30)
moment also in wrestling a very common (84:28 - 84:32)
thing is like this wrestler (84:30 - 84:35)
always loses to this wrestler but always (84:32 - 84:37)
beats this wrestler so there's like this (84:35 - 84:39)
weird triangle of like (84:37 - 84:41)
a beats b b b c c beats a but like they (84:39 - 84:44)
can never beat each other and i'm all (84:41 - 84:47)
i'm like to me it's like can k does ash (84:44 - 84:49)
never beat alan is alan just the one (84:47 - 84:52)
person that like elan can lose to other (84:49 - 84:56)
people but alan can't lose to ash (84:52 - 84:59)
maybe i i feel i mean alan is the only (84:56 - 85:00)
one (84:59 - 85:02)
of these characters to come out of a (85:00 - 85:07)
pokemon series that was not ash centered (85:02 - 85:08)
so (85:07 - 85:11)
that's a lot of power (85:08 - 85:12)
a lot is the most interesting person in (85:11 - 85:15)
the in the bracket by far (85:12 - 85:17)
he's the only person that is not from a (85:15 - 85:19)
game who has won a championship and who (85:17 - 85:22)
has beat ash and who has made (85:19 - 85:24)
multiple people in the world upset that (85:22 - 85:26)
he beat ash like most people (85:24 - 85:29)
dislike ash most people are like ash is (85:26 - 85:31)
a lousy trainer ash never won a (85:29 - 85:33)
championship (85:31 - 85:35)
ash and then and they were like ash (85:33 - 85:37)
should have won this championship which (85:35 - 85:41)
made alon this instant heel character (85:37 - 85:42)
for for (85:41 - 85:44)
beating ash with the type advantage with (85:42 - 85:45)
the (85:44 - 85:49)
uh the type disadvantage (85:45 - 85:49)
it's like really interesting (85:50 - 85:55)
it almost feels like (85:52 - 85:57)
if we needed to end the pokemon series (85:55 - 85:59)
we're ending it here obviously that's (85:57 - 86:00)
not gonna happen that's not gonna happen (85:59 - 86:02)
this is never gonna happen (86:00 - 86:05)
we'll never be free (86:02 - 86:05)
uh (86:06 - 86:11)
but uh overall it it's very exciting (86:07 - 86:13)
um (86:11 - 86:14)
question of the week (86:13 - 86:16)
question of the week (86:14 - 86:16)
oh (86:16 - 86:19)
the question of the week (86:16 - 86:23)
set to a leipa (86:19 - 86:25)
uh i don't actually know a dualipa song (86:23 - 86:27)
so dang (86:25 - 86:29)
whatever is trending on tic tac at this (86:27 - 86:30)
point (86:29 - 86:34)
that is also not dual lipa (86:30 - 86:34)
not treading on tick tock (86:34 - 86:39)
i don't know i just found out that some (86:37 - 86:41)
lyrics of a kanye song that's popular on (86:39 - 86:43)
tiktok were completely different than (86:41 - 86:45)
what i thought (86:43 - 86:46)
they were when i looked up what the (86:45 - 86:49)
actual lyrics were (86:46 - 86:49)
this is from slack from lewis uh what is (86:53 - 86:56)
the favorite concert you have ever (86:55 - 86:58)
attended there's some music for you and (86:56 - 87:00)
then i'll grab a youtube question here (86:58 - 87:02)
dang (87:00 - 87:03)
okay (87:02 - 87:05)
so not (87:03 - 87:07)
it's hard so (87:05 - 87:10)
sift john stephen's carry and lowell (87:07 - 87:12)
album is an incredibly difficult album (87:10 - 87:16)
to get through and the concert was (87:12 - 87:18)
one of the most emotional concerts i've (87:16 - 87:20)
ever do i'll never forget it but i can't (87:18 - 87:21)
say it was my favorite because it was (87:20 - 87:23)
like (87:21 - 87:27)
gut wrenching (87:23 - 87:27)
so you have to pick one (87:33 - 87:38)
i would go with (87:35 - 87:38)
probably the sugar cubes when they were (87:41 - 87:45)
just getting popular at the at first (87:43 - 87:47)
have because nobody really knew them so (87:45 - 87:50)
everybody there was actually a super fan (87:47 - 87:52)
and that was a lot of fun except for the (87:50 - 87:54)
guy that like (87:52 - 87:56)
inappropriately hit on me that was not (87:54 - 87:59)
fun but the rest of the concert was (87:56 - 87:59)
this is a real tough call for me because (87:59 - 88:03)
i've seen a lot of concerts i've seen a (88:01 - 88:04)
lot of concerts (88:03 - 88:07)
seen a lot of live shows (88:04 - 88:08)
uh (88:07 - 88:11)
i think i'm gonna have to say of (88:08 - 88:13)
montreal because (88:11 - 88:17)
i was not expecting (88:13 - 88:20)
what that turned out to be (88:17 - 88:22)
at all (88:20 - 88:23)
and like just (88:22 - 88:29)
how amazing of a show that they put on (88:23 - 88:31)
uh yeah (88:29 - 88:33)
i i'd have to say like if i could see (88:31 - 88:35)
another of montreal show in a hot second (88:33 - 88:38)
i'd be there (88:35 - 88:38)
steve has never been to an actual (88:39 - 88:43)
concert no i've been to (88:40 - 88:45)
a lot of bad concerts at the rave in (88:43 - 88:48)
milwaukee it's a terrible video (88:45 - 88:50)
i mean (88:48 - 88:51)
um (88:50 - 88:55)
because you guys have the um had the (88:51 - 88:57)
summerfest that's summerfest there are a (88:55 - 89:01)
lot of musicians there right mm-hmm yeah (88:57 - 89:02)
i (89:01 - 89:04)
have only seen a handful of concerts at (89:02 - 89:07)
summerfest because it is an awful venue (89:04 - 89:09)
it is they have this thing where like (89:07 - 89:13)
all the stages have um benches in front (89:09 - 89:15)
so what happens is when the band comes (89:13 - 89:18)
out everyone stands on the benches (89:15 - 89:20)
and then it instantly gives them a two (89:18 - 89:22)
feet advantage so if you're not on a (89:20 - 89:24)
bench but you're in the back you can't (89:22 - 89:25)
see anything because everyone's two feet (89:24 - 89:28)
taller yeah and i don't get why they (89:25 - 89:29)
just don't (89:28 - 89:30)
remove the benches (89:29 - 89:33)
i mean i've seen a lot of like (89:30 - 89:36)
the state fair has a lot it draws really (89:33 - 89:39)
big names so like i could say the person (89:36 - 89:41)
that i've seen in concert the most is (89:39 - 89:42)
cindy lauper i think i've seen cindy (89:41 - 89:47)
lauper in concert five times now (89:42 - 89:47)
they're always fun but i can't say it (89:47 - 89:50)
was like (89:49 - 89:53)
my favorite one i mean she does a good (89:50 - 89:54)
show (89:53 - 89:57)
i've probably seen the walkman most and (89:54 - 89:59)
i traveled around the country to see (89:57 - 90:01)
them in a few different places that them (89:59 - 90:02)
are the french kicks but the french (90:01 - 90:05)
kicks were opening for the walkman so (90:02 - 90:06)
like i was just talking about my top (90:05 - 90:09)
concert so cindy lauper then i would say (90:06 - 90:11)
tori amos i've seen the most and lake (90:09 - 90:14)
street dive i've seen the most (90:11 - 90:14)
we have to go see jukebox the ghost uh (90:15 - 90:20)
yes i've seen them once they do a great (90:18 - 90:22)
show i need to see them again i saw them (90:20 - 90:24)
with the french horn rebellion that was (90:22 - 90:26)
a really interesting show they were (90:24 - 90:27)
opening i think they were opening for (90:26 - 90:29)
escort (90:27 - 90:31)
the theater they always choose in (90:29 - 90:33)
minnesota is a garbage theater wow i (90:31 - 90:36)
don't like diversity at all (90:33 - 90:38)
uh i guess my answer is i saw my comic (90:36 - 90:41)
romance show that was pretty good (90:38 - 90:43)
this is pretty good that's the best (90:41 - 90:44)
you're gonna get (90:43 - 90:46)
you know why it was good though is (90:44 - 90:48)
because it was in an actual theater (90:46 - 90:51)
oh yeah yeah so like there wasn't there (90:48 - 90:53)
wasn't like everyone had seats (90:51 - 90:55)
oh and like you just like sat down and (90:53 - 90:56)
like watched (90:55 - 90:57)
and it was great there was like there (90:56 - 90:59)
was like a small area up front where you (90:57 - 91:01)
could stand but it was like very tiny (90:59 - 91:03)
maybe like 50 people could stand there (91:01 - 91:06)
but it was like yeah i i have gotten to (91:03 - 91:08)
the point in my life where like i don't (91:06 - 91:09)
want i want to sit down and i don't want (91:08 - 91:11)
people touching me i don't want to be in (91:09 - 91:13)
like a crowd anymore i don't want people (91:11 - 91:15)
pushing past me like that's cool you (91:13 - 91:17)
want to get to the front i just i just (91:15 - 91:19)
want a seat i don't want i don't want i (91:17 - 91:20)
don't want i want i'm not shoulder to (91:19 - 91:22)
shoulder no i just (91:20 - 91:24)
there is a criteria for brent and i to (91:22 - 91:26)
go see shows is (91:24 - 91:29)
is it assigned seating (91:26 - 91:30)
uh because i don't care if i can see or (91:29 - 91:31)
not (91:30 - 91:33)
as long as i can sit (91:31 - 91:34)
down (91:33 - 91:37)
because i did not i cannot stand (91:34 - 91:39)
in a crowded theater for four hours (91:37 - 91:43)
anymore i can't do it i don't want yeah (91:39 - 91:46)
i at least with something like warp tour (91:43 - 91:48)
you could just kind of walk from stage (91:46 - 91:49)
to stage and stand on the back and see (91:48 - 91:52)
it just fine and it was big and spacious (91:49 - 91:54)
and like outside and you just (91:52 - 91:56)
walked to the next venue because there (91:54 - 91:58)
was like seven stages anyways uh this is (91:56 - 92:00)
off youtube (91:58 - 92:03)
uh this is from uh (92:00 - 92:04)
avolis (92:03 - 92:08)
uh what do you think is the most digimon (92:04 - 92:12)
looking pokemon released so far (92:08 - 92:12)
um (92:24 - 92:27)
necrozma (92:25 - 92:29)
yeah oh yeah those are those ones that (92:27 - 92:32)
get real big yeah that (92:29 - 92:33)
i think i'm going to go with the (92:32 - 92:34)
crossbar but of course you know when (92:33 - 92:36)
somebody says to me like (92:34 - 92:38)
a a digimon looking thing i think of (92:36 - 92:42)
like the small digimon (92:38 - 92:43)
like the little like (92:42 - 92:46)
like the little blobby guys (92:43 - 92:49)
them like the little the little dinosaur (92:46 - 92:50)
guy (92:49 - 92:52)
who was everybody's friend (92:50 - 92:55)
agumon sure (92:52 - 92:56)
i've watched like three seasons of (92:55 - 92:59)
digimon i can't remember a single one of (92:56 - 93:01)
them (92:59 - 93:01)
i mean we can just say that (93:01 - 93:08)
agumon is just a ripoff of charizard and (93:04 - 93:10)
be done with it (93:08 - 93:13)
no i don't know greymon not really i (93:10 - 93:17)
mean they're like both dragons but (93:13 - 93:19)
i think there's like a color (93:17 - 93:22)
probably like poiple i think to me like (93:19 - 93:24)
would be more like (93:22 - 93:26)
a good little (93:24 - 93:27)
i would i would maybe argue a lot of the (93:26 - 93:29)
ultra beasts kind of push in that (93:27 - 93:30)
direction yeah attributes do push a (93:29 - 93:33)
little little digis i don't know what it (93:30 - 93:36)
is about digimon (93:33 - 93:36)
i think that's like a bigger (93:36 - 93:39)
conversation of like pokemon versus (93:36 - 93:42)
digimon versus like yu-gi-oh or like (93:39 - 93:44)
really any like you can even include (93:42 - 93:46)
final fantasy creatures okay watch (93:44 - 93:48)
yeah (93:46 - 93:50)
i think the thing like here the thing (93:48 - 93:52)
that i think really made me appreciate (93:50 - 93:54)
pokemon a lot more (93:52 - 93:56)
and and i don't know maybe it's because (93:54 - 93:57)
i do a pokemon podcast and i stream (93:56 - 93:59)
pokemon a lot but like (93:57 - 94:01)
when gen 8 came out (93:59 - 94:03)
like i felt like i remembered all of (94:01 - 94:05)
those pokemon (94:03 - 94:07)
very quickly like even a pokemon that (94:05 - 94:09)
like probably no one has ever said that (94:07 - 94:11)
is their favorite pokemon like dotler (94:09 - 94:14)
like that middle like people like um (94:11 - 94:15)
well i actually don't know if anyone (94:14 - 94:17)
likes blip bug but (94:15 - 94:20)
somebody does i'm sure somebody does (94:17 - 94:23)
but like (94:20 - 94:23)
temtem (94:23 - 94:29)
i played four hours of temtem (94:26 - 94:33)
and i cannot tell you a single (94:29 - 94:35)
creature's name (94:33 - 94:38)
like i and i i genuinely tried to like (94:35 - 94:40)
like it and learn it and there was like (94:38 - 94:41)
a lot to learn because they were like (94:40 - 94:43)
this is techno type this is acid type (94:41 - 94:45)
this is (94:43 - 94:47)
wave type uh (94:45 - 94:50)
crystal mental toxic (94:47 - 94:52)
and i walked away from that being like (94:50 - 94:54)
there wasn't even a creature and i saw (94:52 - 94:56)
like 30 of them that i was like man that (94:54 - 94:58)
creature is cool (94:56 - 95:00)
i just like there was just really (94:58 - 95:02)
nothing to connect with and i kind of (95:00 - 95:04)
feel the same way with yu-gi-oh i look (95:02 - 95:05)
at a lot of yu-gi-oh stuff and i'm like (95:04 - 95:07)
uh i don't really care but then i see (95:05 - 95:08)
like (95:07 - 95:10)
dark magician girl or i see like blue (95:08 - 95:12)
eyes white dragon (95:10 - 95:15)
dragon baby those are really connectable (95:12 - 95:16)
and obviously because those are like (95:15 - 95:18)
some of their flagship creatures over (95:16 - 95:19)
there magician (95:18 - 95:21)
that yugioh show (95:19 - 95:24)
but man there was like nothing in temtem (95:21 - 95:26)
that i ever gravitated towards and (95:24 - 95:27)
there's something about pokemon designs (95:26 - 95:29)
where even if you're like i hate that (95:27 - 95:31)
ice cream cone it's like you remembered (95:29 - 95:33)
that ice cream cone well i think one (95:31 - 95:34)
thing that (95:33 - 95:36)
pokemon does really well in their design (95:34 - 95:38)
is like one of their core principles is (95:36 - 95:40)
that the silhouette has to be (95:38 - 95:41)
recognizable (95:40 - 95:44)
and has to be separate from like it's (95:41 - 95:46)
hard to mistake it for other things i (95:44 - 95:48)
mean even when it's jigglypuff from (95:46 - 95:49)
above you're like oh that's clearly (95:48 - 95:51)
another voltorb it's a jigglypuff shape (95:49 - 95:53)
and i think that is a strength of how (95:51 - 95:55)
they design pokemon that they don't tend (95:53 - 95:58)
to take into other games where (95:55 - 96:01)
each has to be recognizable from its (95:58 - 96:03)
silhouette so thus you get very (96:01 - 96:06)
interesting memorable shapes (96:03 - 96:06)
i i'm sure there's somebody that could (96:12 - 96:16)
do like their whole like life's work (96:14 - 96:18)
thesis on (96:16 - 96:18)
like (96:18 - 96:23)
creature design in between series (96:18 - 96:24)
there's a lot in digimon that i really (96:23 - 96:26)
gravitate towards too that i like more (96:24 - 96:29)
so than yu-gi-oh where like yu-gi-oh i (96:26 - 96:30)
think is cool i don't think i could ever (96:29 - 96:32)
re-watch the show or pick up the card (96:30 - 96:34)
game again but i think it's cool is it (96:32 - 96:36)
creepy (96:34 - 96:38)
yes what is cool about yu-gi-oh i don't (96:36 - 96:40)
know you know like heart of the cards (96:38 - 96:42)
you've activated my trap card you've (96:40 - 96:43)
activated my magic jammer you've (96:42 - 96:47)
activated my magic jammer like that's (96:43 - 96:47)
everybody is jamming magic at this point (96:48 - 96:53)
i don't know there's something cool (96:52 - 96:56)
about like this adult possessing a kid (96:53 - 96:58)
and then everyone in the world being (96:56 - 97:01)
like very okay with it that's very bad (96:58 - 97:04)
that is very don't know (97:01 - 97:05)
what do you mean that's what i don't get (97:04 - 97:07)
about the show is like the pharaoh is (97:05 - 97:09)
like i'm taking over yugi and everyone's (97:07 - 97:10)
like (97:09 - 97:14)
okay okay just because you can see the (97:10 - 97:16)
change in yugi's physical form does not (97:14 - 97:19)
mean the people in the cartoon world can (97:16 - 97:21)
see the change they just thought he was (97:19 - 97:23)
getting serious to play the game it's (97:21 - 97:24)
like yeah (97:23 - 97:27)
i shall send you to the shadow realm (97:24 - 97:30)
like whoa he's serious when he plays (97:27 - 97:31)
this game (97:30 - 97:33)
wow (97:31 - 97:33)
and then you can come back like what (97:33 - 97:38)
just happened where was i oh you kidder (97:35 - 97:41)
that was a tough game wasn't it (97:38 - 97:43)
yeah they only do that for like seven (97:41 - 97:45)
years (97:43 - 97:47)
i mean joey wheeler's the best character (97:45 - 97:49)
so (97:47 - 97:50)
should we re-watch yu-gi-oh should we (97:49 - 97:52)
start a yeah (97:50 - 97:55)
started re-watching yu-gi-oh recently (97:52 - 97:56)
and (97:55 - 97:58)
it's not easy (97:56 - 98:01)
it's not easy if there's a huge spike in (97:58 - 98:03)
money like (98:01 - 98:06)
a huge patreon goal like if you give us (98:03 - 98:08)
ten thousand dollars a year i will (98:06 - 98:10)
re-watch i will re-watch and do a (98:08 - 98:13)
specialty podcast around to you you know (98:10 - 98:15)
for my old (98:13 - 98:18)
podcast the patreon the 50 000 a month (98:15 - 98:21)
level was literally will will start (98:18 - 98:23)
playing yu-gi-oh (98:21 - 98:24)
that tells you (98:23 - 98:26)
what it would take for me to get (98:24 - 98:27)
involved (98:26 - 98:30)
there is a very successful buffy the (98:27 - 98:33)
vampire podcast out there i i did not (98:30 - 98:35)
know that there is this obsession with (98:33 - 98:38)
buffy the vampire what (98:35 - 98:39)
that could you not know that how could (98:38 - 98:41)
you not know that and it's the vampire (98:39 - 98:43)
slayer thank you buffy is not the actual (98:41 - 98:46)
vampire buffy is not a vampire she slays (98:43 - 98:48)
the vampires (98:46 - 98:50)
um they make a lot of money on patreon (98:48 - 98:53)
i'm just asking is there that kind of (98:50 - 98:56)
audience for yuki no there is not (98:53 - 98:58)
well (98:56 - 98:59)
okay (98:58 - 99:01)
players are poor that's why they play (98:59 - 99:04)
in popularity levels yukio is still an (99:01 - 99:08)
incredibly pop like when i go to play (99:04 - 99:09)
card games on tuesday nights it's (99:08 - 99:11)
coincides with yu-gi-oh night and there (99:09 - 99:13)
are still plenty of people (99:11 - 99:15)
i love it plenty of people come to play (99:13 - 99:17)
yu-gi-oh and i swear (99:15 - 99:19)
i have never (99:17 - 99:22)
been around yu-gi-oh players where (99:19 - 99:25)
ninety percent of the match isn't (99:22 - 99:27)
what makes you think you can do that (99:25 - 99:29)
why can you do that (99:27 - 99:32)
i don't think you can do that (99:29 - 99:32)
this is how you play yu-gi-oh i don't (99:33 - 99:37)
think you can do that (99:35 - 99:39)
prove to me you can no (99:37 - 99:40)
no (99:39 - 99:42)
see you can only normal summon that one (99:40 - 99:45)
you can't synchro summon that one so see (99:42 - 99:47)
now you've got that wrong (99:45 - 99:49)
that game is so (99:47 - 99:51)
wild (99:49 - 99:52)
i just want you to stream it i just like (99:51 - 99:54)
screaming at people you've activated my (99:52 - 99:57)
trap card i do that yeah and then i get (99:54 - 99:58)
to scream you've activated my magic (99:57 - 100:00)
jammer (99:58 - 100:01)
but (100:00 - 100:03)
you're correct like no you guys sound (100:01 - 100:05)
awesome i'm convinced it's incredibly (100:03 - 100:10)
popular but i don't think the yoyo (100:05 - 100:10)
i think that card got banned (100:11 - 100:15)
uh i got modified i don't know if it got (100:13 - 100:16)
banned (100:15 - 100:19)
yugioh's not big on b well wait a minute (100:16 - 100:21)
that's the story of yu-gi-oh is they ban (100:19 - 100:23)
things (100:21 - 100:26)
right after they yeah (100:23 - 100:26)
no (100:26 - 100:31)
look i need to ride a dark magician guy (100:28 - 100:31)
deck (100:31 - 100:33)
no i want to (100:31 - 100:36)
run red-eyes black dragon oh that's the (100:33 - 100:36)
bad one (100:36 - 100:38)
it's the edgier version of blue eyes (100:36 - 100:40)
white ring you got to do the wizard of (100:38 - 100:42)
oz one i don't think that's what (100:40 - 100:46)
you think is the wizard of oz (100:42 - 100:47)
there is a wizard of oz archetype in (100:46 - 100:50)
yugioh i i don't remember (100:47 - 100:51)
what you ever see some yu-gi-oh cards (100:50 - 100:53)
you like it it's like (100:51 - 100:56)
99 text and then there's a very tiny (100:53 - 100:57)
picture at the top and you're like give (100:56 - 100:59)
me like 30 minutes to like read this (100:57 - 101:02)
very comprehensive vanguard you are (100:59 - 101:03)
correct (101:02 - 101:05)
all right we need to end the show uh (101:03 - 101:07)
will what is pokemon of the week (101:05 - 101:10)
last week's pokemon i lost what i wrote (101:07 - 101:13)
down about it i just remember it has a (101:10 - 101:16)
similarity to a particular yokai from (101:13 - 101:18)
yokai watch and (101:16 - 101:21)
bad smells and something or other (101:18 - 101:24)
it's (101:21 - 101:24)
dark magician girl no (101:24 - 101:29)
we're switching it's dunky (101:27 - 101:33)
stunky that is the guy i thought (101:29 - 101:33)
how does croagunk relate to the yokai (101:36 - 101:41)
who had a butt face (101:38 - 101:44)
oh i thought i just think krogunk looks (101:41 - 101:46)
more youkai than stunky's donkey just (101:44 - 101:47)
looks like a s (101:46 - 101:50)
an animal have you seen cheek squeak (101:47 - 101:54)
no it's literally a butt (101:50 - 101:57)
with a body (101:54 - 101:57)
i mean i guess stunky is too in a way (101:57 - 102:04)
and crow gunk does kind of look yo yo (102:02 - 102:05)
kaiwachi though (102:04 - 102:09)
who knows what that even means i we just (102:05 - 102:11)
the only thing that yokaiwachi means is (102:09 - 102:13)
like a cat with a swirly on its head (102:11 - 102:15)
okay (102:13 - 102:17)
if you look up a picture of cheek squeak (102:15 - 102:19)
you will see stunky (102:17 - 102:21)
exactly unavoidable exactly (102:19 - 102:22)
oh (102:21 - 102:25)
this show is off the rails (102:22 - 102:29)
despite being based on a striped (102:25 - 102:33)
stripped species of skunk stunky sprays (102:29 - 102:37)
from its handstand like a spotted skunk (102:33 - 102:40)
as seen in the episode the secret sphere (102:37 - 102:42)
of influence (102:40 - 102:44)
stunky can be seen parallel to glamio (102:42 - 102:46)
stunky is exclusive to pokemon diamond (102:44 - 102:48)
and black 2 while glamio is exclusive to (102:46 - 102:51)
pearl and white 2 and their evolved (102:48 - 102:53)
forms are used by team galactic (102:51 - 102:57)
commanders jupiter and mars respectively (102:53 - 103:00)
both belong to the field egg group and (102:57 - 103:02)
as a two-stage evolutionary line both (103:00 - 103:07)
cannot be found in pokemon platinum ooh (103:02 - 103:09)
that's actually pretty good trivia yeah (103:07 - 103:12)
