[Music] so [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 456 episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me is greg all right i have a very important question okay this is this is a new thing i've learned and i need to know where we all fall on it let's say you have a bag of fresh skittles not old skittles no fear of skittle jobs oh does it have to be skittles or can it be a good candy no it has to be what look let's not go down this road do you eat each individual flavor so you can savor the flavor or do you just eat handfuls of random skittles like a monster okay judgment excuse me because stop number one skittles come with an instruction manual that tells you exactly how to eat them that garbage candy if you're going to put commentary up in here taste the rainbow taste the rainbow not taste the blue taste the red taste the yellow taste the rainbow part of the rainbow no incorrect perfect pure form you have failed at skittles you are admitting to the world that you eat handfuls of random skittles like i don't eat any skittles because that is just the nastiest candy ever it is not sour punch bites steve what do you do this is important i'm pretty sure this is a trick question because i'm pretty sure all skittle flavors are the same they are not the same oh my god yeah i'm pretty pretty close variation variations on this orange grape do you know what's the worst do you know who are the worst kinds of people in the world people who put skittles on their honeycombs like the what like the cereal the cereal or the yes i'm just i'm just trying to aggravate the skittles community and the honeycomb cereal community because those people have been coming for me since day one okay and you know what i ain't having it so put your skittles on your honeycomb and pour some coca-cola in there because you know pepsi is the better soda so steve you are admitting that only can you not taste the individual flavors that you just eat and i'm almost positive there's like studies on this where people where people think that they taste different but they actually don't look weird why would they change green from lime to green apple if they didn't have different flavors why would they announce to the world from lime which tasted good and then you can find those and they taste completely different to green apple which does taste completely different which you would know if you didn't eat handfuls of skittles randomly like a monster there has to be there i'm i'm positive we don't have enough time in this pokemon episode that's maybe true but i am almost positive there's like a blind taste test where people can't actually taste the difference between skittles that being said i grab handfuls of skittles like a monster and i eat them and it's awesome cause skittles are pretty good candy no wrong but you do fill your mouth with that juicy fruit fruitish flavor yes also sour patch bites is sour punch bites sour candy it if you want true entertainment in your life give me a bag of sour punch bites for breakfast and i tell you i start bouncing off the walls like uh like a super bowl it's amazing like m m's are the same flavor they but they haven't been sad evidence doesn't advertise that they have different flavors they just say this is why they're failing in the marketing department they're candy-coated chocolate it melts in your mouth not in your hand that is the whole point what no what you missed greg was the point of eminem's is to train you from being a small child that hey this bag of multi-colored pill shaped things all taste the same so just grab handfuls of them and toss them in your mouth so that when you get to the skittles dilemma you already know it doesn't matter all the colors you just talk like level two skittles like level three yes exactly we're not even going to talk about the people that post online that they put skittles reese's pieces and m m's in the same bowl okay those people are monsters they are they are they are the absolute monsters they are at my friend's wedding that's no friend i did mix skittles and m m's just to be peppers it was the end of the night look everyone already had drinks it was like i i hadn't had a single drop to drink you ruined the dessert for me no we were trying to kick people out so on the way out when they grabbed a handful of skittles they also got m m's and that's a real wake-up call right there when you're expecting fruit and you get chocolate uh this is a pokemon program also here will was going to say was that greg has successfully driven me out of minneapolis congrats you win take the city buddy yeah move further south don't don't dox me you know what else is further south texas texas jamini all right we are recording this on a saturday not a sunday so i'm doubting that pokemon news is happening there's no news uh there we have some we have some um so the so the news we'll start off with is that players cup 3 is happening right now even though all those matches have taken place but they recorded the matches and then they put commentary over the matches and then they're broadcasting it on youtube and twitch this current weekend wrestlemania weekend some would say who would say that uh wrestling fans the w and because again we i still cannot comprehend why we would do players cup 3 broadcasting ask people to participate in players cup 4 which is also happening this weekend and say hey there's a community today this weekend when probably next week nothing is going to happen maybe something is going to happen and they're getting the stuff out of the way max raid max raid special april 17th the greatest holiday i still can't get over when sword and shield released it was like the same weekend as a community day and the same weekend for the uk uh regional or the uk regional tournament or whatever so all these people in the uk had who cared about competitive had to play their ultrasound ultra moon to like try to qualify the same week in a brand new game and heck heck if they played pokemon go well maybe maybe the they've done the venn diagram and it's just like the tiniest little tiniest overlap of anybody who would care sufficiently about all three they like a solid date everybody across the organization can remember the one date when they ask isn't that on the 11th everybody says yes it's all on the 11th it's all on the 11th exactly and then there's no confusion um there there is some news regarding players cup three so there are uh on april 10th and 11th is when they will be doing the players cup 3 regional region final stream that'll be over by the time this comes up but there will be a code card first 50 thousand people will be able to get an elder goss v uh that you can use in your deck full art they did this last time it was a zashian v and um i think it was a full art professor's research and they did say fifty thousand and boy i don't it was they didn't they didn't go so by the time this broadcast goes up we'll probably on my on twitter at pokemon podcasts we'll have the code i'm sure you'll see it elsewhere but if you're desperately looking for it it'll be in our twitter feed there will also be a password although that as as we're recording that hasn't been given out there will be a password for a dream ball a free dream ball and pokemon sword and shield doesn't seem there's a limit for that so i'm very confused why ptcgo has limits maybe it's just built in the game maybe they're i don't know i don't i don't know why sword and shield has never had like limited like only first a thousand people but ptc gio has i've got some things to say about pt cgo oh yeah you do and then on uh april 23rd to the 25th which is the global finals is where they do the like the top stuff there will be a full art boss's orders for the pokemon tcg getting given away and there will also be um weakness policy if you want the the hard defined item of weakness policy that will be given away even though you could just go to rose's tower and buy it for 50 battle points that's a lot of battle points i know it's more battle points than i have i i'm confident you have more than 50 battles i don't know about that i don't know how i would have gotten them i don't believe if you if you have the three ball guy shirts you also have 150 battle points oh wow why are there not more bald guy shirts you know i i'm i am actively angry that there has not been a luxury bald guy shirt okay so that was players cup three players cup four is happening uh i did not participate in the players cup for vgc it was uh too close to other things happening in my life i will try to qualify for the players cup for tcg which will be at the hot twist end of the month well look that was more time right you know yeah but judging by yesterday you're just torturing yourself to try to do this so you watched greg okay so that was all i saw was something about opening 300 packs and i said uh no i mean hacks the packs were fun to watch because that was a whole lot of winning and then i will slide into madness of watching steve not play this game it was awful oh ptcgo it's it's rough yeah the rng is stacked against steve specifically at that oh yeah six tails in a row yeah seven it was seven because i the tails on the next game and then i got another chance this is rosencrantz and guildenstern territory do people ever remember that play yes i trust greg you and i remember that play i have had code cards since like november i open cards on my stream you know every time we have a scam train anytime somebody wants to throw money at me at every level of the scam trade and we open a booster pack that's something i've been doing well before this car drought right just a fun thing to do on stream i like collecting cards makes makes the whole like scam trade a little more fun for for viewers to be like well we get another booster pack anyways i mean they don't get a booster pack you get another booster pack they get to watch you open it craig don't tell the secret which which is the true scam yeah i know that's why it's called the scam i have asked you many times to send me all of your rosalia cards and you have sent exactly zero look i'll eventually be in minnesota you can just come over and i probably have 300 plus just grab one on the way out i mean i have my own i other wonderful fans have sent me cards because you have constantly denied me my birthright i have the rosalios okay so i redeemed i redeemed all these cards into ptcgo last night we booted up ptcgo we opened up you know 50 sword and shield we opened up 60 rebel clash 100 vivid voltage 50 darkness plays 50 shining you know we opened up over 300 cards and we had an incredible luck you know we pulled some zashian's we pulled some crams we pulled uh three different charizards between shining fates darkness ablaze and vivid voltage did you get the charizard do you we got the do you want to do your flex because you flexed it all yeah already wait when i saw while he's getting his flex ready fancy there it is when i saw the shining fates at target it was like in little metal uh they kind of look like altoids boxes the tins ah the tins are a scam okay that's why i didn't get it scams no they still um they still have shutting fates in it it's just you're paying extra dollars for an altoids 10 that you probably have nothing to do with i have a lot to do with that no you can always make like hot take you can make like two altoid tins work in your life but once you get to like five or six you're running out of things that's like when i used to get the when i used to play the tcg and i would buy the tins and i just had when i moved out of dc i think i had something like 20 of those tins stacked up yes in a closet and they were full of like common pokemon cards yeah yeah they're they just hold garbage cards yeah i think new jersey chris inherited all those tins or somebody maybe it was james one of those kids spoiler alert they tossed them um so probably so i we opened up a bunch of packs it was it was an awesome stream it was super fun uh we'll probably like do a supercut and put it on youtube and then i was like okay so there there was a cramer ant deck not a meme deck an actual competitive craymarant deck that won a korea tournament south korea of course and uh this kramer rant deck i think right now is also being participated in the players cup three i think um they actually showed it this morning while we were streaming here so i'm thinking i i i mentally i wasn't able to participate in player skip four i have for many years was a competitive tcg player player's cup four for tcgs at the end of the month that's like three two weeks away at this point we got plenty of time and this might be the only opportunity in pokemon history where our cramer ant deck is actually going to be viable uh last night's performance calls that sentence into question okay so last night's performance was watch the word potentially the deck itself is good me as a player who hasn't played well i haven't played ptcgo in over a year like play it i've opened packs in it and i haven't played competitively in a high level at in like five years seven years i think because i've been in this house for six so seven years boy was i rusty but i thought the entire time i'm thinking man the pokemon trading card game was bad at one point and then it was good and then it was bad again but i forgot that the client is the worst thing in the world true they're like my second game i play a capture energy so you put an energy on the cram and it says you can go into your deck and find another pokemon because you're playing the capture energy to capture a pokemon in your deck very powerful card and so i play the capture energy and i go this is gonna be a great turn i'm gonna go in i'm gonna grab another porygon blah blah blah and i click and because i clicked slightly off of the porygon it it the game was like you don't want a pokemon shuffle shuffle and then put my put my deck away i did want that pokemon oh where you exactly wanted me to click and then the game did this weird thing it's not weird i i realized what it did it's so silly it's so dumb though so um an ability where you can put as many energy colorless energy from your hand to your pokemon which is an incredibly powerful play because in the pokemon trading card game you can only play one energy a turn but when you have this porygon up you can play as many energy in your hand as you want and so if i have three energy in my hand but i only want to play two i then have to hit the done button to say i don't want to play that last energy and then i can carry on with my turn but in the in the case of and and i did that multiple times in the game and i was against a an opponent that i was going to win and i only had two energy so i place those two energy and i go to hit done but the game was like you don't have to hit done i didn't realize this is the part i didn't realize because i'm a dum-dum and so the same place where it says done to say stop hitting energy is also the same place where it's done for your turn so i went to hit done to say like i'm done applying energy but the game already decided that so when i hit done it was like your turn's over okay your opponent's turn now and i was like but i i was trying to hit done for my energy i didn't get to attack for my turn why are these buttons in the same place and why are they both green so i mean basically what you're saying is you need to be more careful about how you click user yeah also the game is rigged i flipped seven tails in a row statistically that is like impossible it is not impossible statistically it's possible it's just yes exactly like in a chance where i was like i just need two heads and we'll be in a very good position and then i flip six tails it's like well we were just quitting this game now because there's no coming back in a world where coin flips exist six coin flips of the same type also exists probabilities of flipping seven tails in a row is one in 128. so that's better than shiny odds better than china look at that you've messed yourself up by shiny hunting all the time that seems really low why isn't it there's only two options each time yeah exactly it's not like 50 objects yeah it's not like rolling a 18 on a d40 20 times it's just the entire time playing ptcgo though we didn't play that long we only played like an hour and a half or something um i always think like people come into my stream or people ask all the time you know us like what we want from pokemon like they're always like are you excited for a gen 4 remake are you excited for a black and white remake would you like to see pokemon z uh would you what do you want the thing i i don't want any of that like i mean i want some of that wait like like i'm excited for a gen 4 remake is that the thing i wanted for the last 15 years no will they eventually make remake black and white yeah probably is that the thing i like want right now no the thing i really want is just the new client for ppcgo it's just so bad and somebody was somebody last night was like well maybe they don't make a maybe they don't make a new client because uh it doesn't make enough money it doesn't make any money there's no way to give this game money i feel i feel bad for the company that direwolf digital yeah yeah because direwolf digital does a lot of stuff that is very high quality and pokemon fans only know them for this terrible terrible client and i have to at this point assume is the pokemon company not wanting that client updated the pokemon company international international yeah well they don't want to put money towards it yes which is interesting just because it's like in it i i would have like if i was a foreseeing person in like may of 2020 i would have said hmm let's let's toss these dudes some cash didn't wizard of the coast used to own the pokemon game yes yeah they owned the first four or five own or were they public they were urged to to create yeah i mean imagine if they still had it then they would be part of uh mtg arena no because i wa are we are we going to say that magic the gathering arena is a more stable and more reliable product than the pokemon trading card game online because i've heard that that client is not also so arena arena is actually very good yeah nothing wrong with arena except people who don't know how to play the game and loose i i have nev the problems that you have in washington last night i have never had any of those issues in arena yeah i think the thing that people complain about with arena is that there are they are still adding all of the cards like there are cards that are missing because magic has been around and they've just introduced the historic format and historic doesn't have all of the cards that are in historic or whatever and magic pumps out new sets and so they always focus on getting the new stuff in so there is a backlog of other stuff um and there are way there are ways to break magic the gathering arena i've watched a streamer who had like 400 things attacking and had left the when i stopped watching the client had been running for 24 hours and still hadn't calculated how to do the attack it was still there it was still checking along but it hadn't changed in 24 hours because the game client was still trying to figure out how to do the damage of what had just happened on screen yeah i think people's biggest complaint about arena like i think really the largest community complaint about mtg arena is there's 327 different magic formats ways to play the game and they only have implemented like six [Laughter] the other 321 format players are like why can't my format be represented i don't i don't doubt that magic or yu-gi-oh or pokemon that the rules of a trading card game are incredibly complex and there's so many cards in the past and so many cards coming that would affect these rules in different situations across different formats um but i feel like it's not that much too it's it's not like i'm saying like i want a pokemon mmo with 17 regions and 100 pokemon because that would that in reality would be a terrible game um but uh to say like i want a worldwide client because ptcgo is not worldwide there's no ptc joe in japan i would want a worldwide client across mac pc ios android and nintendo switch and it's on three of those i mean it's on ipad but it's technically not on iphone but like iphone is your biggest market for for ios like it's on android tablets but you can side load it on to android phones but again you want it to be as accessible as possible it's not on switch which it should be um it's on mac and pc um there's no japan but to have a client and then to have that client be able to translate like hey if japanese players are playing with japanese cards but they're playing an english player the game on that end just translates the car like you're now playing and like a german player bringing english you don't have to worry about reading german cards it just auto translates and then just to have like a stable client and maybe like i you know eight years ago maybe the pokemon company international was very scared of micro transactions and having players spend too much money but now we have pokemon go we have pokemon masters we have cafe mix we have pokemon quest we have all these games where even masters will yell at you if you spend too much money like masters will be like hey don't spend this much i mean you can ignore it and keep spending of course we've done our diligence so we can't get sued by throwing up a warning message saying don't spend this much kid but we we've had this conversation before where like they know that people are going to um like troll and toad or people are going to ebay and they're spending a hundred dollars for 200 code cards and then they're scanning those 200 code cards in because they want code cards yeah like there is the average casual player going to target well before this drought going to target buying like a elite trainer box coming home opening the eight packs redeeming the codes maybe playing around a little but that's not like a serious forte forte is that a good word that's not like a serious like eight eight booster packs from target and you may be being like i want to get into competitive pokemon and getting eight booster packs in ptzo isn't helpful it's like okay but like if somebody wanted to get into ptc geo on the whim like having that person drive to target buy a theme that come back redeem the theme deck just like just give me an option to buy the theme deck in the game like let me just spend like two bucks or let me just let me get like 50 booster packs and then i can be like i can get addicted to opening booster packs and then like okay i opened 50 i spent some money now i can build a deck or now i can trade like you can't do much with buying a handful of packs at target unless you're consistently buying a handful of packs at target but then you're already consistently ready to spend money right i i think the pokemon company's noted reluctance to online things it bears its face in this like they have never been great at online stuff they have always been so overly cautious because they know they have a large kids audience that i think it really that their sort of philosophy of not being great about online stuff out of fear just runs through everything there has to be like more kids though playing go oh more yeah yeah or like i i i would sure but like there's no communication in go like the idea is that i think how they sort of can warp their way around it is if a kid is playing go they're out with their guardian who is protecting them and there are no online inter like i can't talk to you in go i can't send you chats i can't do you can't technically talk in tcgo so you can send like emotes yeah even outside of that though the the thing is like go masters cafe mix which are the three main ways that you can spend money directly through an app right magikarp jump yep magikarp jump okay that still proves my point there uh they're all on mobile devices so for a child to have a mobile device the parent has already made the decision to give them access to a way to spend money and also mobile devices do have built-in hey you're actually not allowed to spend any money using this device right or pass code for that on the computer there is no way to do any kind of authenticated financial transaction well they would have to build something right but but yeah but i think they're just afraid to do that it's not native to the platform where it is native to the phone platforms yeah yeah i think they just don't like touching it i think they they have they've never wanted to go down that path and they let other people do it for them and i think that shows a lot in in all of their online stuff so you're never going to get it you're never going to get a good time just deal with it but but also like what if they signed like a 15-year license with direwolf and they're just like literally just waiting for that to run out that's true that they can have another company start developing it and they're just like we don't want direwolf to get five percent of every transaction i mean i think the amount of money they make off of go they could probably buy direwolf out at this point wolf ain't for sale buddy sure everybody's for sale yeah but is it is it like they don't like dire wolf so they're just not giving direwolf money and they're running out that contract or i mean or what if the original contract with direwolf is like if if we are ever authorized to process financial transactions direwolf gets 80 of the transaction and the pokemon company is like heck no we're just never going to let that well that that's true the pokemon company is very good at just we will of the cadet cadaver yeah they run out the clock they they will run out any clock i don't know what i don't know what the reason would be but i mean they have to know that after this last year that client is hurting their brand and i i think they are still banking on live tournaments being their thing and not being online i think they're still banking on this being a short-term problem and going back to live events like how they want it to be i think like like as somebody who the the problem with like all live events there's there's probably that fear of like well if we if we do online events then people don't want to come to the live events and i think other industries have proven that that's not true right um and as somebody who did like like i know i know some listeners are or maybe new to the show and greg wasn't even on the show when when i was super into the trading card game will was but as somebody who seriously tried to compete in the pokemon tcg circuit back in black and white emerging powers and noble victors and all the way up to like plasma freeze and stuff that was three years of my life where every single weekend i was driving 30 minutes plus up to four to five hours away to go to a tournament spend 12 hours at a tournament because they're all poorly run not have a lunch because like again they're so poorly run that they could like they're so far behind that they can't even fit into lunch break have some of the most ridiculous rules because like because the coaches or the sorry not the coaches but the like event organizers are too scared to actually like deal with confrontation and then spend another four hours back and that was your saturday and sunday and then like you did that the next weekend like i i can't remember a weekend where i wasn't on the road hating my life at like 6 a.m in the morning because i needed to be in like madison or i needed to be in lacrosse or i needed to be in like rapids to participate in a tournament and if you didn't if somebody's like well just don't go to all of them you had to because the point level was so high yes that you had to go to every single one of them just to even qualify and like you maybe you would get like oh instead of 40 people at this tournament there's only 35 but because like they were able to do at least two online tournaments and make up the points but i don't ever want to go back to being on the road for an entire season to hit up battle roads and and cities and and regionals and states and now obviously most of those don't exist anymore they changed names but back when i was doing it was like battle roads states cities regionals nationals it's just so time consuming um on top of being expensive on top of like needing the cards like when i was when i was in the format the um one of the best decks at the time was was four mewtwo's and four dark eyes eighty dollars each for those cards and it was like do i want to spend eighty dollars on eight cards or eighty dollars eight times or do i wait until after this this format is over which is in like two months and then darkram u2 are intends for 15 and it's like well that's the best deck so i'm gonna drive six hours with a deck i can't afford spend 12 hours of my weekend gas restaurants hotel all of that that's that's why i could never do competitive even though i like enjoyed it and wanted to it's just like and you had to go to the big regionals you had to you had to go at least yeah and do well on at those regionals like the fact that they they may be scared of wanting to put money into an online client is insulting to their players i'm not saying it's not i mean i'm not saying that it's not at this point is a bad business practice i'm just saying that they seem to be stuck in that mode i think they are stuck in that mindset and i i the only thing is that they've been working on a better client and they're going to unveil it one day yeah and that guy does digital the reason they're not putting money in is because they know another client is coming down the line i can't imagine the tcg is as travel difficult in japan as it is here right well no they got them bullet trains so i i still think like there is a a lack of understanding of of just like the distances it's like when people from europe are coming to visit america like we're going to be in chicago so you can come visit us right i'm like chicago is nine hours away seven hours away if i drive fast like that's not this the scope of where these things are is vastly different yeah i mean i got from osaka to tokyo in about three hours on a bullet train that was cool don't know what that means where's osaka very far north osaka is like where andrew is and that helps even less is it where does skate the infinity take place i don't know what is that it's a new anime dude about skateboarding it's real good i don't know but here here's the thing too this is this is a last point i would make i mean you have you have always had at these irl tournaments um an incredible amount of tcg players compared to video game players like the the regionals that i top cut it at which was in fort wayne indiana it was the biggest regionals of like two thousand twelve fifteen or thirteen or whatever i top cut it with dark rice ability so that was like slightly after dark explorers came out 2012. there you go it was the biggest regionals ever in the united states i don't remember i think it was 1200 players it was 1200 tcg players and then no joke there was only like uh uh like 200 video game players and the video game players they came in and they were done in like four hours and i'm i'm here at like a two day long tournament 12 hours a day with like no lunch break because they had so many players they just we have to go as fast as possible otherwise because we need to be done in two days and right before the pandemic happened with sword and shield there was actually like a huge amount of vgc players and the problem is like it's it the the you so it's it's obvious that there's so many people that want to participate and compete in the tcg it's been obvious for years right like it's not like this it suddenly became this new issue but the problem is you have this this client that is just awful to be in it's just not like you can't play the you can't it would be like if sword and like say what you will about certain shield if you hated the characters if you hated the story whatever but when you're playing sword and shield it doesn't feel like it's crashing or slogging or like you're trying to like select a move and it's just not clicking like at least sword and chase like i have played certain ship for almost two years i think it's crashed like twice like it's like sandwich like the game itself is is actually it works right it's it's fine yeah it does tcg is like is it even going to register the new update i mean there's like there's two uh like business problems in in decision science that i can see happening potentially one is you have people who have made a decision and they don't want to admit that it was the wrong decision and therefore rather than reevaluating they dig in and two you have a client and rather than recognizing that people are playing this because they enjoy the game and this is the only place to play it they're saying to themselves the client must be fine because we have so many people playing it yeah right and it's like i mean put the least amount of money towards the greatest return and it's like we got tons of people playing this so we don't need to toss any more money at this but you start with the client and you're like oh is this like a flash game from like 20 people this is you this is you this isn't grandpa pokemon who is like oh i mean i see all the kids out there in the field playing it so we updated the wood texture it took us six years but we updated the wood texture it looks like four percent better ah gosh it's all about the trees it always comes down to the trees basically it does doesn't it all right unbelievable let's take a break we got some more pokemon news we will be right back [Music] and we are back from our break let's talk about pokemon center they added dot com pokemon center dot com they added a new collectible pikachu collection but it it looks like they're the funkos and it's presented like the funkos because they did the silhouettes and nowhere on the page does it say it's from funko you are burying the lead are we talking about the pikachu pikachu moods yeah are we going to talk about the bedtime buddy because that's the important thing bedtime buddy look at the landing page for pokemon center.com dude and tell me you're going to just sit and ignore that the massive meowth yes oh yeah there they restocked the meowth they didn't know they had never come out in the first place yeah it sold out like the first day i mean it's 300 yeah they probably only made 10 with the expectation of selling like six and then they sold all 10. it's huge it is huge 65 inches it's as big as a tv it's almost as big as me is it this is like i'm like 74 inches yeah yeah this is like the pokemon thing though right you partner with somebody good they do the job and then you you you you do it yourself later at a cheaper price but you still make the same profit right like you partner with wizards of the coast they get you off the ground then you make your own tcg so you can make more money you partner with um four kids because they know how to do anime then you do a couple seasons and then you move to a significantly cheaper anime to cut costs and to hire cheaper people and then you make more money you partner with funco because they know how to make toys they made a bunch of pikachu toys now you make this it's not as good as the funko like look at the lines on this pikachu mood sleepy figure already sold out but this is this is this looks like funko's work but it's not one cup what you're complaining about is called capitalism you're talking about that you don't like he's uh it's it's the close-ups of like the jigglypuff as you can see he's supposed to be a doll so it's supposed to be sewed like the lines are the same yeah but look at look at look at pikachu's open eye and the red circle they're they're just not painted with the precision that i want for my fifteen dollars i mean i will give you the circle and the eye like the circle is looking a little sloppy but my question is who who made the the eevee seasons those were also phone calls those were funka okay so it was the pikachu holiday or pikachu a day with pikachu yeah those are funko and then it was the eevee and these have like they look like the same bait maybe maybe it is funko it doesn't say it doesn't say on the website they the other two did it's made of resin yeah i ordered it so i guess we'll see what the quality is of course you did look i'm a fan of pikachu i like the boy you're a fan of resin you are a fan of being a sucker that if i'm going to complain on this program about a 15 non-funko product i got to put my money where my mouth no you don't what maybe maybe it's good maybe it's all right what about that picture and you complaining about that picture is going to suddenly change when you get it because they took the picture of the best one that they had it arrives and it says funko on it and maybe i'm wrong the whole maybe it is funko maybe they just forgot to update you you're just buying a product to see if it was made by funko no i'm just you just uh losing my mind you know they they showed the second part of the parade greg oh they did yeah they took it off the because because whoever's running the pokemon center dot com doesn't know how to upload and hide a product that it was like uploaded for like 45 minutes and then they had to take it back down it was an oshawott a score bunny and a rowlet and it was really cute and really awesome and now i regret not buying the first part of the trip well and you can't go back you have to go to ebay to go back but okay first of all nobody saved this image on the internet it's somewhere i'm trying to find it two okay i want everybody to pause the video and zoom in on the chaos of memorabilia that you have behind you yes yes you are going to have to move here i found it i found it five or six hours uh and you have to pack all that stuff up i'm not helping this oh the stuff behind me and you want to add more the item is i will say that like the problem with the first one wasn't that it wasn't cute i see the exact same problems here that i saw in the first one you did you didn't like the the cobblestone street i like that street oshawa weird painted yeah by the way yeah i mean the same problems that i have everybody kind of looks like it's seeing something off to the side that is horrifying that it's horrifying stopped mid-snack because it's like i can't believe what i can see with my eyes what's happening over there so if you hadn't said that this was part of the parade and there was a beginning of it this doesn't nothing about this says they're part of a longer parade it's literally three pokemon on a cart you can't have it without pikachu pikachu is leading the parade you i guarantee you pikachu will finish the parade [Laughter] you can just say it started here and it ends with pikachu they saved the best for last you don't think that this one is better than the first one no i mean i'm not working also i can't turn it around like i can't see all the things but like the wheel is wonky the oshawa's collar is wonky like there's the same things that i saw on the first one as being weird i'm still seeing on this as being weird like there's nothing about these resin models knowing that i would be in it for the long haul and then paying 40 per item that makes me think i want to keep i would want to jump aboard this parade and ride it to the end porcelain or die ah this is off gizmodo gosh i haven't heard gizmodo in a while who sent this in somebody from our slack community sent this in uh robert did playing with the playing the world's largest six foot long 65 pound nintendo switch looks like an excellent workout uh michael pick is a mad scientist behind this creation that was built from a combination of plywood and used an overall shell to embiggen uh to enbig in the cost of the console oversized buttons turned out from a 3d printer and a 4k screen in the middle measuring 70 inches long pix custom switch is a 650 percent larger than the nintendo's original switch um and then it talks about how there's like a reprogrammed joy-con on the inside with an hdmi and i believe oh it does say this in the article i was gonna say maybe i need to go i had two articles but it does say it at the end um this was donated to st jude's children hospital in nashville tennessee so kids can enjoy it so the controllers don't come off right no but they no there's another video that shows he just has a pro controller hooked up to it uh so is the world's largest uh nintendo switch light um chew way to drop the ball gizmodo except that it's got two different color joy-cons yeah but they don't come off yeah i don't think they slide up and up yeah so therefore it's a nintendo switch light look it's for kids you got you put one kid on the truth it's always been about truth and games journalism how dare you how dare you [Laughter] [Music] pokemongolive.com rival week begins sorry rival week brings rival pokemon and competition plus therian forum landorus coming to five star rates from tuesday april 13th to sunday april 18th skrelp and cloncher will be making their pokemon go debuts they will appear in the wild in raids and through field research therian forum landorus will make its pokemon go debut in five star raids enjoy rivals week challenge in the global challenge arena all trainers around the world can work together to win raid battles to unlock twice catch stardust bonus for the event pokemon known for rivalries will appear more in the often such as hitmonchan hitmonlee makahita meditate zangus saver and more did we know that makuhita and meditate had a rivalry i did not know that i don't know where that came from i feel like a little bit of stretch right there but you know like i'm going to i'm going to go look into the trivia and see if there's anything in my hook they probably have similar stats would be my guess well likes to eat and meditate doesn't eat at all uh rivalries will continue in raids as well pokemon like nidoqueen nidoking zangus and saver will appear more in raids enjoy event exclusive research that will lead to encounters with rival pokemon such as skrelp and quanture and sources tell us that team rocket will be taking over more pokestops more often and balloons more frequently can they please have some water fire or grass shadow pokemon so i can finally finish that stupid assignment the new one i i know the the original team rocket research one where you have to purify a water grass or fire oh my gosh like so long ago available hey they had a snover that's on grass at one point they just had to execute that's also grass i didn't get those because i was like i'm so brokenhearted at all the shiniest vipers or whatever that i'm getting swimming and shining nothing about this legendary meditate rivalry i also did not realize that quanture and skrelp were rivals so i would say i agree like xango's a viper that is that and uh corsola and uh the thing that eats it oh why can't i think of its name nasty green greedy greedy yeah the that one toxic type toxic croak no no the sea urchin in underwater and toxic pecs is what it turns into yeah yeah yeah cause marina eats corsola yes that's a rivalry and then it turns into a cursed law oh i forgot about this news sorry i should have moved this news closer to the pokemon center news because it has to do with pokemon merch this is off nintendowire.com another new batch of merchandise uh coming it's called ball freak uh what uh the line is associated with merch matching pokemon to pokeball designs mewtwo with the master ball umbreon with the moon ball sylveon with the love ball mimi cute with the luxury ball and draggapalt with the dusk ball uh items include keychains mimikyu and umbreon neckties hand towels sticky notes umbreon and sylveon lidded mugs socks washi tape clear files washi tape it's that the one for ceiling letters remember yeah washi tape is super popular oh yeah okay okay uh whole line launches in japan online on april 24th which means if we do get this it'll probably be like next year yeah um and it probably won't become it probably won't be called ball freak for us they will probably change the name yeah there is a very cute moon ball tie bar and i'd be very curious if that would come to the united states except then you have to wear a picture of it where's where are you getting those pictures oh this was sent in by slack i believe it wasn't it was me i found the news take that slack get ready new ball freak ooh oh those are cute yeah it's a cute line ooh the luxury the luxury ball clip is excellent you are a fan of the luxury ball i am but i'm better we'll have to we'll have to import it greg okay because i i feel like if anything's not the cups never like come usually the washi tape never comes maybe we get the socks uh maybe we get the ties i'm not sure oh i do not like the luxury ball socks i like the you should order them anyways just to see if you don't like them in person correct i mean it is only fair as a professional that i waste my money getting products i know i won't like so i can verify that it's something so you also ordered the pikachu movie i did not i did not do that no i think that's i think that's it for pokemon news it's uh the 25th anniversary is really off to a blazing start it's april right like we are two months in well into this right am i wrong we are into something uh oh you know we didn't talk there is one more bit of news we didn't talk about uh chilling rains chilling rains yeah like the diamond rain that you get on your birthday is that like chocolate rain no chil chilling rain is the sixth main sword and shield expansion for the pokemon trading card game it will be coming out june 18th the japan release is called silver lance and jet black spirit and that comes out april 23rd um it's supposed to have ah well in japan it has 140 cards we don't know how many cards in english but this is the set with calorics steer glass tree glass tree yeah this is how they said it on the broadcast and spectrier spectrums now added to pokemon yeah we know there's ice rider for him we know there's the shadow rider there is melanie is one of the tc the trainer cards of the set i'm not sure what she does right now and there's cast form in the set and uh casper is there is there a website that has all the leaked pictures uh i'm sure there probably is but we'll we'll have the whole set in less than two weeks because it comes out in japan so somebody will scan them all and we'll see everything they do so that set's coming out that's like rain as in rain from the sky or rain as in like yeah like on a horse a horse's reins uh r-e-i-n yeah the hot seat it made sense greg but sure there's window clings um did you just say the word window clinks cling cling what is a window cling you know the the plastic thing you stick on windows no yeah yeah i know i know as designs no people put it in the back of their cars for whatever reason oh no you put them up for like easter right yeah no no valentine's day my parents loved window clings yeah they had them all greg question of the week uh all right hold on now's the time in the podcast for the question of the week i wonder what question will be asked it's got my interest peaked i don't know we're gonna get a second verse there i know pretty pretty well done but you can't do that song with only one verse really you really can't because people won't know what it is uh stuart from our slack says do you think there will be ever be a time where you grow out of pokemon or will you still be playing when you're 80 plus all right uh i know karate is in quotes but i'm going to do my rant you can lose interest in something i dislike the people always say are you ever going to grow out of that meaning that it's something only for children i may lose interest in something or they may do something that turns me away from the game but i don't think liking something at a young age and continuing it on is something to grow out of uh like i saw star wars as a child and i will be a star wars fan forever just because i saw it as a child doesn't mean it's childish uh but i mean is there something that they could do maybe i possibly i i mean there are there are i go through phases where i just don't want to play pokemon like i'm just not into it right now uh but i always come back to it so will they do something or will there come a time where i just straight up lose interest possibly it doesn't seem likely given my personality since i tend to hold on to things forever [Music] but i mean they may take the game in in ways that i don't enjoy uh and that's fine but i i do not think there'll be a time where i will completely lose interest in pokemon right like you're not going to get to an age where you're like well now i only read perused right i don't i don't play video games anymore i mean my eyes will probably give out and i can't see it anymore that is the most likely scenario on that path definitely um i mean yeah i i i think that that the term grow out should only be used for like i used to play with duplo and now i've grown out of duplos and i can play with the actual legos yes right uh will i ever get tired of pokemon i mean who knows right yeah who knows what the future will bring yeah i highly highly doubt it if they stopped creating new content new games and they were like we are done we are getting this concept if they themselves stop then i will if they hit their 25th anniversary and are like we are so done with this concept we can't even celebrate our own 25th anniversary then i would look still look back fondly on my experiences with the franchise but otherwise there's always something new around the corner yeah something new to enjoy i mean even when i didn't like omega ruby off of sapphire and i only got to like the third gym or fourth gym and i was like i don't like this like i still liked pokemon there's just other things in pokemon that i went to instead i mean they are good expansive brand right like they have kept the quote-unquote fad alive for 25 years now and they've shifted their marketing to age with the people who have grown up and they recognize hey people have grown up and enjoyed our products so you know what we're going to do fancy business shirts expensive business shirts custom you need this i always sort of they have a similar marketing strategy to disney like disney is very much geared towards a young audience for the basis of their films right like they are g-rated films for the most part but they are very good at still making things in those films relevant for adults so that adults can still very much enjoy that product um like how many well i know this is pixar but like how many like eight-year-olds understood the first 20 minutes of up right maybe it was like 10 minutes it's like 10 minutes and it is a rough 10 minutes yeah but yeah like i think they are good at both companies are very good at finding the all ages line that works right like there is stuff that that adults can pick up and understand at a deeper level that are still a part of the movie like pixar's soul is a very very good film and there are themes in there that really only resonate with adults but the concept and what happens in the movie still resonates with a younger audience like they're very good at straddling i think pokemon is very good at straddling uh all ages and doing all ages well well they've said multiple times in interviews that when they make a new pokemon game they think about new players coming in right and i think that's why maybe people have nostalgia for the first game they play we were talking about this before the show of how people will be like oh my favorite game is the first game i played they did a really good job at capturing you right and they they can't recreate that again right like if your first game was diamond and pearl and then your second game was x and y you will never have that same feeling that you had with diamond pearl there's there's no game company movie whatever can have you can recapture that first initial thought or experience sorry right um and people are actively making themselves unhappy trying to chase that first initial thing that'll never happen again yeah but that's not to say that they don't care about their old fans right because they include so many things to help old fans still enjoy the games whether that's uh like bottle caps or the battle tower or um updating all the ability like the the mechanical things that that like a new fan wouldn't even notice or like a new fans wouldn't be like oh you didn't have bottle caps 10 years ago yeah like the things that aren't as impactful than new people right like quality of life changes aren't impactful on new people because they don't have a quality of life experience with a series of games like this is their new game and this is how that game runs so quality of life changes are very much for old fans like we have updated this aspect to make this easier for long-term fans of the game like and they're very good at doing that and sometimes they cut stuff that um a very vocal slash very small percent of fans enjoy but um that would be like for example like the battle frontier or star yes like they said that they put a lot of work in the battle frontier and they saw that almost they saw that a lot of players never interacted with it and so because players didn't interact with it they they didn't want to put the amount of time but those players that did interact with it are very very vocal um it's like it's a shame that some of those things don't get explored more but again anything that's post game is always going to be uh for the for the smallest version the smallest population of players right yeah like credits roll done with game yeah post game stuff is always going to be a minority of players uh and i i do think of post game stuff battle frontier was one of the best ones they ever did um but again anything that like you can never rely on anything b that's post game sticking around unless is a catching mechanic and even then that's question like friend safaris have never come back right it's post game stuff you can never rely post on post game stuff coming back which is what i wonder why maybe they moved the legendary to post game like in sword and shield because it then makes you because you want the legendary right yeah well i mean mewtwo is technically post game four that's true true yeah like they do keep like a catching mechanic post post game and those are usually easy to do right away you get them you get introduced some to some incredible well that's not safe easy i mean like rayquaza deoxys was like three hours to like get through that it's like jeez i just want not that hard and you got to meet a very important character yes he becomes important in masters later so he's cool it's one of my favorite things ever was when um like on the playstation there's trophies and so i remember like playing destiny and you could see like only 80 percent of people got this far in the game because you could tell by the trophies and i i i think the best part of destiny was when they introduced the raid which was vault of glass and for like the first year of that game being out if you were to look at how many people completed vault of glass it was like two percent of all playstation players but that was legit the best part of destiny and only two out of a hundred people it's the battlefront probably able to experience that yeah and as like destiny became like a three-year-old game i think that number eventually topped out at like 20 percent because they like made it easier to get into and stuff but also that was like a living game like they were updating at every i mean and that also happens with like final fantasy 14 there are some of the best dungeons aren't mandatory they're you know late in the game after people have completed the main quest and then people just drop off until the next expansion but some of the best dungeons are not mandatory dungeons they're just super fun to do and i think that's just the life cycle of keeping your hardcore players happy is always going to be like hardcore players like your hardcore fans are always going to be the minority of people who play your games going back to the question of will you ever grow out of pokemon my mom said this to me multiple times [Laughter] and before pokemon go it was a very common thing of like what are you gonna grow out of pokemon and then as soon as she started playing pokemon go that that that expression left her vocabulary my mom used to say to me all the time she just get mad that i play video games and so i would for her birthday buy her handheld games like oh you know just something to do in your spare time and then two months later she would send me angry voice messages like how dare you get me addicted to these things and i'm like this is what you can't you can't tell me to stop playing these super fun things when the minute that you have one you can't put it down she was addicted to testress for a long time and pac-man about our mini pac-man machine and she's like you have to buy me another one because i broke it because i played it too much i think i mean i always want to ask sports sport ball watchers like football players when you're going to grow out of football yeah right when are you going to grow out of these things you played those as a kid when are you going to grow out about liking cars right when are you going to grow out of that like you may eventually lose interest sure every things change i may eventually lose interest in pokemon it could happen i do not see that as a as a likely outcome uh because i'm clearly a huge fan of the show that i can talk about it for an hour and a half every week without without a problem uh i don't i don't foresee that being a likely outcome will what is our pokemon of the week well the pokemon of the week from last week it was very short and i wanna i almost feel like going into school teacher mode about once again listen to all the words because a lot of people made assumptions because they left out some of the words but i'll just read the whole thing again because it was really short a is for the ability thick fat p is for purple shiny r is for the region hoenn i is for ice ball l is for lower brine cave it is always the last line that's the most important it's flapple [Music] no that needs to be one there are no flapples in hoenn there aren't [Music] w-a-l-r-e-i-n yeah it's probably wall for walrus yes rain foreign no exactly although i'm going to argue that i think like it's shiny looks more pink than purple to me but that is ah that's a piece we'll go let's go with the p yes piece is a good one while rain is based on a wall risk good trivia thanks there's really no trivia for walls wall raid may be a combination of walrus and the corruption of rain or rain this is a gen 3 pokemon right yeah and it's one that appears in a lot of things it has got a excellent shuffle and a very very good shiny uh i don't care about wall rain but man's feel is a winner yeah true true but there are no smiles in lower brian cave friends why is spheal a winner and walray not what is it because it's just a big round boy it's the big big yeah oh yeah yeah he's a ball he's a big old ball i mean wolverine is cool uh but if you like come on it's feel there's no competition are we all just going to ignore celia in the middle yeah it's actually all right it's like celio is this is what i'll say if we look at other seal families we got seal s-e-e-l peak peak creativity they really knocked it out of the park with that one we got seal into dugong and we got into celio and celio is at least something dugong is like nothing is one of the most bland pokemon ever that's going to be pokemon of the week in two weeks just so i can revive dugong it's got a sweet horn a cute mermaid tail it's got cute tusks you've just described goldie no goldie doesn't have tusks celia's all right i mean are you gonna not bring in popplio the other sea lion that's oh popular blows them both out of them like papaya was awesome i thought popplio was a dog yeah popular i mean at least dugong is based off of something yes phil is based off of a beach ball come on well what's the next tweet all right all right this is a long one so strap in now that my shiny hunt for shinx has ended i have started a new shiny hunt on snapchat if you are curious as
