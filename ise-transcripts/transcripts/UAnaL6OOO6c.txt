so (0:15 - 0:18)
[Music] (0:22 - 0:29)
what's up everyone welcome to the 456 (0:26 - 0:32)
episode of the pokemon podcast it's (0:29 - 0:34)
super effective i'm your host (0:32 - 0:37)
sbj with me is greg all right (0:34 - 0:40)
i have a very important question okay (0:37 - 0:40)
this is (0:40 - 0:42)
this is a new thing i've learned and i (0:40 - 0:45)
need to know where we all fall on it (0:42 - 0:47)
let's say you have a bag of fresh (0:45 - 0:48)
skittles (0:47 - 0:50)
not old skittles no fear of skittle jobs (0:48 - 0:51)
oh (0:50 - 0:53)
does it have to be skittles or can it be (0:51 - 0:54)
a good candy no it has to be (0:53 - 0:58)
what look let's not go down this road do (0:54 - 1:02)
you eat each individual flavor so you (0:58 - 1:03)
can savor the flavor (1:02 - 1:06)
or do you just eat handfuls of random (1:03 - 1:08)
skittles like a monster (1:06 - 1:11)
okay judgment excuse me (1:08 - 1:14)
because stop number one skittles (1:11 - 1:17)
come with an instruction manual that (1:14 - 1:19)
tells you exactly how to eat them (1:17 - 1:20)
that garbage candy if you're going to (1:19 - 1:22)
put commentary up in here taste the (1:20 - 1:23)
rainbow taste (1:22 - 1:26)
the rainbow not taste the blue taste the (1:23 - 1:27)
red (1:26 - 1:30)
taste the yellow taste the rainbow (1:27 - 1:34)
part of the rainbow no incorrect (1:30 - 1:37)
perfect pure form you have failed at (1:34 - 1:38)
skittles (1:37 - 1:40)
you are admitting to the world that you (1:38 - 1:42)
eat handfuls of random skittles like (1:40 - 1:44)
i don't eat any skittles because that is (1:42 - 1:46)
just the nastiest candy ever it is not (1:44 - 1:49)
sour punch bites steve (1:46 - 1:52)
what do you do this is important (1:49 - 1:53)
i'm pretty sure this is a trick question (1:52 - 1:54)
because i'm pretty sure all skittle (1:53 - 1:56)
flavors are the same (1:54 - 1:58)
they are not the same oh my god yeah i'm (1:56 - 2:00)
pretty pretty close (1:58 - 2:02)
variation variations on this orange (2:00 - 2:03)
grape (2:02 - 2:05)
do you know what's the worst do you know (2:03 - 2:06)
who are the worst kinds of people in the (2:05 - 2:07)
world (2:06 - 2:09)
people who put skittles on their (2:07 - 2:12)
honeycombs (2:09 - 2:12)
like the what like the cereal the cereal (2:12 - 2:18)
or the yes i'm just i'm just trying to (2:16 - 2:19)
aggravate (2:18 - 2:22)
the skittles community and the honeycomb (2:19 - 2:23)
cereal community (2:22 - 2:25)
because those people have been coming (2:23 - 2:27)
for me since day one okay (2:25 - 2:29)
and you know what i ain't having it so (2:27 - 2:30)
put your skittles on your honeycomb and (2:29 - 2:31)
pour some (2:30 - 2:34)
coca-cola in there because you know (2:31 - 2:36)
pepsi is the better soda (2:34 - 2:39)
so steve you are admitting that only can (2:36 - 2:41)
you not taste the individual flavors (2:39 - 2:42)
that you just eat (2:41 - 2:44)
and i'm almost positive there's like (2:42 - 2:46)
studies on this (2:44 - 2:48)
where people where people think that (2:46 - 2:49)
they taste different but they actually (2:48 - 2:52)
don't (2:49 - 2:52)
look weird why would they change green (2:53 - 2:56)
from lime (2:56 - 2:59)
to green apple if they didn't have (2:56 - 3:00)
different flavors (2:59 - 3:05)
why would they announce to the world (3:00 - 3:07)
from lime which tasted good and then you (3:05 - 3:09)
can find those and they taste completely (3:07 - 3:10)
different (3:09 - 3:12)
to green apple which does taste (3:10 - 3:13)
completely different which you would (3:12 - 3:13)
know (3:13 - 3:16)
if you didn't eat handfuls of skittles (3:13 - 3:18)
randomly like a monster there has to be (3:16 - 3:20)
there i'm i'm positive we don't have (3:18 - 3:22)
enough time in this (3:20 - 3:25)
pokemon episode (3:22 - 3:27)
that's maybe true but i am almost (3:25 - 3:29)
positive there's like a blind taste test (3:27 - 3:31)
where people can't actually taste the (3:29 - 3:32)
difference between skittles (3:31 - 3:34)
that being said i grab handfuls of (3:32 - 3:37)
skittles like a monster and i eat them (3:34 - 3:38)
and it's awesome cause skittles are (3:37 - 3:40)
pretty good candy no (3:38 - 3:42)
wrong but you do fill your mouth with (3:40 - 3:43)
that juicy (3:42 - 3:46)
fruit fruitish flavor yes also (3:43 - 3:50)
sour patch bites is sour punch (3:46 - 3:54)
bites sour candy it if you want (3:50 - 3:56)
true entertainment in your life give me (3:54 - 3:59)
a bag of sour punch bites for breakfast (3:56 - 4:00)
and i tell you (3:59 - 4:04)
i start bouncing off the walls like uh (4:00 - 4:08)
like a super bowl it's amazing like m (4:04 - 4:10)
m's are the same flavor they but they (4:08 - 4:11)
haven't been sad (4:10 - 4:13)
evidence doesn't advertise that they (4:11 - 4:14)
have different (4:13 - 4:16)
flavors they just say this is why (4:14 - 4:17)
they're failing in the marketing (4:16 - 4:18)
department (4:17 - 4:19)
they're candy-coated chocolate it melts (4:18 - 4:21)
in your mouth not in your hand that is (4:19 - 4:22)
the whole point what no (4:21 - 4:24)
what you missed greg was the point of (4:22 - 4:25)
eminem's is (4:24 - 4:28)
to train you from being a small child (4:25 - 4:28)
that hey (4:28 - 4:32)
this bag of multi-colored pill shaped (4:28 - 4:34)
things all taste the same so just grab (4:32 - 4:36)
handfuls of them and toss them in your (4:34 - 4:37)
mouth (4:36 - 4:39)
so that when you get to the skittles (4:37 - 4:40)
dilemma (4:39 - 4:42)
you already know it doesn't matter all (4:40 - 4:43)
the colors you just (4:42 - 4:46)
talk like level two skittles like level (4:43 - 4:46)
three (4:46 - 4:48)
yes exactly we're not even going to talk (4:46 - 4:49)
about the people that (4:48 - 4:52)
post online that they put skittles (4:49 - 4:53)
reese's pieces and m (4:52 - 4:55)
m's in the same bowl okay those people (4:53 - 4:56)
are monsters they are (4:55 - 4:58)
they are they are the absolute monsters (4:56 - 5:00)
they are at my friend's (4:58 - 5:03)
wedding that's no friend i did mix (5:00 - 5:08)
skittles and m m's just to be peppers (5:03 - 5:08)
it was the end of the night look (5:08 - 5:12)
everyone already had drinks it was like (5:10 - 5:14)
i i hadn't had a single drop to drink (5:12 - 5:16)
you ruined (5:14 - 5:19)
the dessert for me no we were trying to (5:16 - 5:21)
kick people out so on the way out when (5:19 - 5:24)
they grabbed a handful of skittles they (5:21 - 5:25)
also got m (5:24 - 5:27)
m's and that's a real wake-up call right (5:25 - 5:29)
there when you're expecting fruit and (5:27 - 5:32)
you get chocolate (5:29 - 5:32)
uh this is a pokemon program also here (5:32 - 5:39)
will (5:37 - 5:39)
was going to say was that greg has (5:40 - 5:43)
successfully driven me out of (5:42 - 5:44)
minneapolis (5:43 - 5:48)
congrats you win take the city buddy (5:44 - 5:51)
yeah move further south don't (5:48 - 5:54)

texas texas (5:56 - 5:59)
jamini (5:59 - 6:02)
all right we are recording this on a (6:02 - 6:06)
saturday not a sunday so i'm (6:04 - 6:09)
doubting that pokemon news is happening (6:06 - 6:10)
there's no news (6:09 - 6:13)
uh there we have some we have some um (6:10 - 6:16)
so the so the news we'll start off with (6:13 - 6:17)
is (6:16 - 6:19)
that players cup 3 is happening right (6:17 - 6:22)
now even though (6:19 - 6:24)
all those matches have taken place but (6:22 - 6:25)
they recorded the matches (6:24 - 6:27)
and then they put commentary over the (6:25 - 6:29)
matches and then they're broadcasting it (6:27 - 6:31)
on youtube and twitch (6:29 - 6:33)
this current weekend wrestlemania (6:31 - 6:35)
weekend some would say (6:33 - 6:39)
who would say that uh wrestling fans (6:35 - 6:42)
the w and because again (6:39 - 6:46)
we i still cannot comprehend (6:42 - 6:49)
why we would do players cup 3 (6:46 - 6:51)
broadcasting (6:49 - 6:54)
ask people to participate in players cup (6:51 - 6:54)
4 (6:54 - 6:58)
which is also happening this weekend and (6:54 - 7:00)
say hey there's a community today this (6:58 - 7:01)
weekend (7:00 - 7:03)
when probably next week nothing is going (7:01 - 7:05)
to happen (7:03 - 7:08)
maybe something is going to happen and (7:05 - 7:09)
they're getting the stuff out of the way (7:08 - 7:12)
max raid max raid special (7:09 - 7:16)
april 17th the greatest holiday (7:12 - 7:17)
i still can't get over when sword and (7:16 - 7:19)
shield released (7:17 - 7:21)
it was like the same weekend as a (7:19 - 7:23)
community day and the same weekend for (7:21 - 7:24)
the uk (7:23 - 7:27)
uh regional or the uk regional (7:24 - 7:28)
tournament or whatever (7:27 - 7:32)
so all these people in the uk had who (7:28 - 7:34)
cared about competitive had to play (7:32 - 7:36)
their ultrasound ultra moon to like (7:34 - 7:38)
try to qualify the same week in a brand (7:36 - 7:39)
new game (7:38 - 7:43)
and heck heck if they played pokemon go (7:39 - 7:46)
well maybe maybe the they've done the (7:43 - 7:47)
venn diagram (7:46 - 7:49)
and it's just like the tiniest little (7:47 - 7:51)
tiniest overlap of anybody who would (7:49 - 7:52)
care (7:51 - 7:55)
sufficiently about all three they like a (7:52 - 7:56)
solid date (7:55 - 7:58)
everybody across the organization can (7:56 - 8:00)
remember the one date (7:58 - 8:02)
when they ask isn't that on the 11th (8:00 - 8:04)
everybody says yes it's all on the 11th (8:02 - 8:05)
it's all on the 11th (8:04 - 8:09)
exactly and then there's no confusion (8:05 - 8:12)
um there there is some news regarding (8:09 - 8:13)
players cup three so (8:12 - 8:16)
there are uh on april 10th and 11th (8:13 - 8:18)
is when they will be doing the players (8:16 - 8:20)
cup 3 regional (8:18 - 8:22)
region final stream that'll be over by (8:20 - 8:23)
the time this comes up but there will be (8:22 - 8:24)
a code card (8:23 - 8:26)
first 50 thousand people will be able to (8:24 - 8:27)
get an elder goss (8:26 - 8:30)
v uh that you can use in your deck full (8:27 - 8:31)
art (8:30 - 8:33)
they did this last time it was a zashian (8:31 - 8:34)
v and (8:33 - 8:37)
um i think it was a full art professor's (8:34 - 8:38)
research (8:37 - 8:40)
and they did say fifty thousand and boy (8:38 - 8:41)
i don't (8:40 - 8:45)
it was they didn't they didn't go (8:41 - 8:45)
so by the time this broadcast goes up (8:45 - 8:51)
we'll probably on my on twitter at (8:49 - 8:53)
pokemon podcasts (8:51 - 8:55)
we'll have the code i'm sure you'll see (8:53 - 8:57)
it elsewhere but if you're desperately (8:55 - 8:58)
looking for it it'll (8:57 - 9:01)
be in our twitter feed there will also (8:58 - 9:02)
be a password although that as (9:01 - 9:04)
as we're recording that hasn't been (9:02 - 9:06)
given out there will be a password for a (9:04 - 9:07)
dream ball (9:06 - 9:08)
a free dream ball and pokemon sword and (9:07 - 9:10)
shield doesn't seem there's a limit for (9:08 - 9:11)
that (9:10 - 9:14)
so i'm very confused why ptcgo has (9:11 - 9:16)
limits maybe it's just built in the game (9:14 - 9:17)
maybe (9:16 - 9:19)
they're i don't know i don't i don't (9:17 - 9:20)
know why (9:19 - 9:22)
sword and shield has never had like (9:20 - 9:24)
limited like only first a thousand (9:22 - 9:25)
people (9:24 - 9:27)
but ptc gio has i've got some things to (9:25 - 9:29)
say about pt cgo (9:27 - 9:32)
oh yeah you do and then on uh (9:29 - 9:34)
april 23rd to the 25th which is the (9:32 - 9:36)
global finals is where they do the like (9:34 - 9:38)
the top stuff (9:36 - 9:41)
there will be a full art boss's orders (9:38 - 9:44)
for the pokemon tcg getting given away (9:41 - 9:49)
and there will also be um weakness (9:44 - 9:51)
policy if you want the (9:49 - 9:55)
the hard defined item of weakness policy (9:51 - 9:57)
that will be given away even though you (9:55 - 9:59)
could just go to rose's tower (9:57 - 10:02)
and buy it for 50 battle points (9:59 - 10:04)
that's a lot of battle points i know (10:02 - 10:05)
it's more battle points than i have (10:04 - 10:08)
i i'm confident you have more than 50 (10:05 - 10:09)
battles (10:08 - 10:12)
i don't know about that i don't know how (10:09 - 10:12)
i (10:12 - 10:14)
would have gotten them i don't believe (10:12 - 10:16)
if you if you have the three ball guy (10:14 - 10:20)
shirts you also have 150 battle points (10:16 - 10:24)
oh wow why are there not more bald guy (10:20 - 10:25)
shirts (10:24 - 10:28)
you know i i'm i am actively angry that (10:25 - 10:30)
there has not been a luxury bald guy (10:28 - 10:31)
shirt (10:30 - 10:33)
okay so that was players cup three (10:31 - 10:34)
players cup four is happening (10:33 - 10:37)
uh i did not participate in the players (10:34 - 10:38)
cup for vgc (10:37 - 10:42)
it was uh too close to other things (10:38 - 10:43)
happening in my life (10:42 - 10:46)
i will try to qualify for the players (10:43 - 10:48)
cup for (10:46 - 10:50)
tcg (10:48 - 10:50)
which will be at the hot twist end of (10:51 - 10:54)
the month (10:53 - 10:56)
well look that was more time right you (10:54 - 10:58)
know yeah but (10:56 - 11:01)
judging by yesterday you're just (10:58 - 11:04)
torturing yourself to try to do this (11:01 - 11:07)
so you watched greg okay so that was (11:04 - 11:09)
all i saw was something about opening (11:07 - 11:11)
300 packs and i said (11:09 - 11:15)
uh no i mean hacks the packs were fun to (11:11 - 11:15)
watch (11:15 - 11:18)
because that was a whole lot of winning (11:15 - 11:18)
and then (11:18 - 11:22)
i will slide into madness of watching (11:18 - 11:22)
steve (11:22 - 11:26)
not play this game (11:22 - 11:30)
it was awful oh ptcgo (11:26 - 11:33)
it's it's rough yeah the rng is stacked (11:30 - 11:35)
against steve specifically at that oh (11:33 - 11:35)
yeah (11:35 - 11:38)
six tails in a row yeah seven it was (11:35 - 11:38)
seven (11:38 - 11:40)
because i the tails on the next (11:38 - 11:42)
game and then i got another chance (11:40 - 11:43)
this is rosencrantz and guildenstern (11:42 - 11:46)
territory (11:43 - 11:50)

it's just you're paying extra (13:46 - 13:50)
dollars for an altoids 10 that you (13:48 - 13:51)
probably have nothing to do with (13:50 - 13:54)
i have a lot to do with that no you can (13:51 - 13:55)
always make like (13:54 - 13:57)
hot take you can make like two altoid (13:55 - 13:59)
tins work in your life but once you get (13:57 - 13:59)
to like (13:59 - 14:02)
five or six you're running out of things (13:59 - 14:03)
that's like when i used to get the (14:02 - 14:04)
when i used to play the tcg and i would (14:03 - 14:06)
buy the tins (14:04 - 14:09)
and i just had when i moved out of dc i (14:06 - 14:11)
think i had something like 20 of those (14:09 - 14:11)
tins (14:11 - 14:14)
stacked up yes in a closet and they were (14:11 - 14:15)
full of like (14:14 - 14:18)
common pokemon cards yeah yeah they're (14:15 - 14:19)
they just hold (14:18 - 14:21)
garbage cards yeah i think new jersey (14:19 - 14:22)
chris inherited (14:21 - 14:25)
all those tins or somebody maybe it was (14:22 - 14:26)
james (14:25 - 14:29)
one of those kids spoiler alert they (14:26 - 14:31)
tossed them (14:29 - 14:34)
um so probably (14:31 - 14:36)
so i we opened up a bunch of packs it (14:34 - 14:38)
was it was an awesome stream it was (14:36 - 14:38)
super fun (14:38 - 14:40)
uh we'll probably like do a supercut and (14:38 - 14:41)
put it on youtube (14:40 - 14:44)
and then i was like okay so there there (14:41 - 14:47)
was a cramer ant deck (14:44 - 14:49)
not a meme deck an actual competitive (14:47 - 14:50)
craymarant deck that (14:49 - 14:54)
won a korea tournament south korea (14:50 - 14:57)
of course and (14:54 - 14:59)
uh this kramer rant deck i think right (14:57 - 15:01)
now is also being participated in the (14:59 - 15:03)
players cup three i think um (15:01 - 15:05)
they actually showed it this morning (15:03 - 15:07)
while we were streaming here (15:05 - 15:10)
so i'm thinking i i (15:07 - 15:13)
i mentally i wasn't able to participate (15:10 - 15:14)
in player skip four (15:13 - 15:18)
i have for many years (15:14 - 15:20)
was a competitive tcg player player's (15:18 - 15:21)
cup (15:20 - 15:23)
four for tcgs at the end of the month (15:21 - 15:24)
that's like three (15:23 - 15:25)
two weeks away at this point we got (15:24 - 15:27)
plenty of time (15:25 - 15:29)
and this might be the only opportunity (15:27 - 15:31)
in pokemon history where our cramer ant (15:29 - 15:32)
deck (15:31 - 15:35)
is actually going to be viable (15:32 - 15:35)
uh last night's performance calls that (15:36 - 15:40)
sentence into question (15:39 - 15:42)
okay so last night's performance was (15:40 - 15:45)
watch the word potentially (15:42 - 15:49)
the deck itself is good me as a player (15:45 - 15:50)
who hasn't played well i haven't played (15:49 - 15:52)
ptcgo in over a year (15:50 - 15:55)
like play it i've opened packs in it (15:52 - 15:57)
and i haven't played competitively in a (15:55 - 15:59)
high level at in like five (15:57 - 16:01)
years seven years i think because i've (15:59 - 16:03)
been in this house for six (16:01 - 16:06)
so seven years boy was i rusty (16:03 - 16:09)
but i thought the entire time i'm (16:06 - 16:11)
thinking (16:09 - 16:14)
man the pokemon trading card game was (16:11 - 16:15)
bad at one point and then it was good (16:14 - 16:17)
and then it was bad again (16:15 - 16:21)
but i forgot that the client (16:17 - 16:24)
is the worst thing in the world true (16:21 - 16:27)
they're like my second game i play a (16:24 - 16:30)
capture energy so you put an energy on (16:27 - 16:30)
the cram (16:30 - 16:33)
and it says you can go into your deck (16:30 - 16:34)
and find another pokemon because (16:33 - 16:36)
you're playing the capture energy to (16:34 - 16:38)
capture a pokemon in your deck (16:36 - 16:41)
very powerful card and so i play the (16:38 - 16:43)
capture energy and i go this is gonna be (16:41 - 16:44)
a great turn (16:43 - 16:46)
i'm gonna go in i'm gonna grab another (16:44 - 16:48)
porygon blah blah blah (16:46 - 16:51)
and i click and because i clicked (16:48 - 16:53)
slightly off of the porygon it (16:51 - 16:55)
it the game was like you don't want a (16:53 - 16:57)
pokemon (16:55 - 16:59)
shuffle shuffle and then put my put my (16:57 - 17:00)
deck away (16:59 - 17:05)
i did want that pokemon oh (17:00 - 17:07)
where you exactly wanted me to click and (17:05 - 17:09)
then the game did this weird thing (17:07 - 17:11)
it's not weird i i realized what it did (17:09 - 17:14)
it's so silly it's so dumb though (17:11 - 17:18)
so um (17:14 - 17:20)
an ability where you can put as many (17:18 - 17:21)
energy (17:20 - 17:24)
colorless energy from your hand to your (17:21 - 17:25)
pokemon (17:24 - 17:26)
which is an incredibly powerful play (17:25 - 17:28)
because in the pokemon trading card game (17:26 - 17:30)
you can only play one energy a turn (17:28 - 17:31)
but when you have this porygon up you (17:30 - 17:33)
can play as many energy in your hand as (17:31 - 17:34)
you want (17:33 - 17:38)
and so if i have three energy in my hand (17:34 - 17:41)
but i only want to play two i then have (17:38 - 17:42)
to hit the (17:41 - 17:45)
done button to say i don't want to play (17:42 - 17:46)
that last energy (17:45 - 17:50)
and then i can carry on with my turn but (17:46 - 17:53)
in the in the case of and and i did that (17:50 - 17:54)
multiple times in the game (17:53 - 17:57)
and i was against a an opponent that i (17:54 - 17:59)
was going to win (17:57 - 18:03)
and i only had two energy so i place (17:59 - 18:05)
those two energy and i go to hit (18:03 - 18:07)
done but the game was like you don't (18:05 - 18:08)
have to hit done (18:07 - 18:10)
i didn't realize this is the part i (18:08 - 18:12)
didn't realize because i'm a dum-dum (18:10 - 18:16)
and so the same place where it says done (18:12 - 18:19)
to say stop hitting energy (18:16 - 18:21)
is also the same place where it's done (18:19 - 18:24)
for your turn (18:21 - 18:26)
so i went to hit done to say like i'm (18:24 - 18:27)
done applying energy (18:26 - 18:29)
but the game already decided that so (18:27 - 18:31)
when i hit done it was like your turn's (18:29 - 18:32)
over (18:31 - 18:33)
okay your opponent's turn now and i was (18:32 - 18:35)
like but i (18:33 - 18:39)
i was trying to hit done for my energy (18:35 - 18:42)
i didn't get to attack for my turn why (18:39 - 18:44)
are these buttons in the same place (18:42 - 18:48)
and why are they both green so i mean (18:44 - 18:49)
basically what you're saying is you need (18:48 - 18:51)
to be more careful about how you click (18:49 - 18:55)
user yeah also the game is rigged i (18:51 - 18:56)
flipped seven tails in a row (18:55 - 18:59)
statistically that is like impossible it (18:56 - 19:00)
is not impossible (18:59 - 19:02)
statistically it's possible it's just (19:00 - 19:05)
yes exactly (19:02 - 19:05)
like in a chance where i was like i just (19:06 - 19:09)
need two heads and we'll be in a very (19:08 - 19:10)
good position (19:09 - 19:12)
and then i flip six tails it's like well (19:10 - 19:14)
we were just quitting this game now (19:12 - 19:17)
because there's no coming back (19:14 - 19:17)
in a world where coin flips exist six (19:17 - 19:22)
coin flips of the same type (19:20 - 19:25)
also exists probabilities of flipping (19:22 - 19:27)
seven tails in a row is one (19:25 - 19:31)
in 128. so that's better than shiny odds (19:27 - 19:33)
better than china look at that (19:31 - 19:35)
you've messed yourself up by shiny (19:33 - 19:37)
hunting all the time (19:35 - 19:39)
that seems really low why isn't it (19:37 - 19:40)
there's only two (19:39 - 19:43)
options each time yeah exactly (19:40 - 19:45)
it's not like 50 objects yeah it's not (19:43 - 19:46)
like rolling a (19:45 - 19:50)
18 on a d40 20 times (19:46 - 19:54)
it's just (19:50 - 19:58)
the entire time playing ptcgo though we (19:54 - 19:59)
didn't play that long we only played (19:58 - 20:01)
like an hour and a half or something (19:59 - 20:04)
um i always think like people come into (20:01 - 20:05)
my stream or people (20:04 - 20:08)
ask all the time you know us like what (20:05 - 20:09)
we (20:08 - 20:10)
want from pokemon like they're always (20:09 - 20:12)
like are you excited for a gen 4 remake (20:10 - 20:13)
are you excited for a black and white (20:12 - 20:15)
remake would you like to see pokemon z (20:13 - 20:18)
uh would you what do you want the thing (20:15 - 20:20)
i i don't want any of that (20:18 - 20:22)
like i mean i want some of that wait (20:20 - 20:23)
like (20:22 - 20:26)
like i'm excited for a gen 4 remake (20:23 - 20:28)
is that the thing i wanted for the last (20:26 - 20:30)
15 years (20:28 - 20:33)
no will they eventually make remake (20:30 - 20:35)
black and white yeah probably (20:33 - 20:37)
is that the thing i like want right now (20:35 - 20:40)
no the thing i really want (20:37 - 20:44)
is just the new client for ppcgo (20:40 - 20:47)
it's just so bad and somebody was (20:44 - 20:48)
somebody last night (20:47 - 20:49)
was like well maybe they don't make a (20:48 - 20:51)
maybe they don't make a new client (20:49 - 20:51)
because (20:51 - 20:54)
uh it doesn't make enough money it (20:51 - 20:57)
doesn't make any money (20:54 - 21:00)
there's no way to give this game money (20:57 - 21:04)
i feel i feel bad for the company (21:00 - 21:06)
that direwolf digital yeah yeah because (21:04 - 21:08)
direwolf digital does a lot of stuff (21:06 - 21:10)
that is very high quality (21:08 - 21:12)
and pokemon fans only know them for this (21:10 - 21:13)
terrible terrible client (21:12 - 21:16)
and i have to at this point assume (21:13 - 21:19)
is the pokemon company not wanting that (21:16 - 21:20)
client updated (21:19 - 21:22)
the pokemon company international (21:20 - 21:24)
international yeah well (21:22 - 21:25)
they don't want to put money towards it (21:24 - 21:27)
yes (21:25 - 21:27)
which is interesting just because it's (21:28 - 21:32)
like in it i i would have like if i was (21:30 - 21:33)
a (21:32 - 21:37)
foreseeing person in like (21:33 - 21:40)
may of 2020 i would have said hmm (21:37 - 21:43)
let's let's toss these dudes some cash (21:40 - 21:45)
didn't wizard of the coast used to own (21:43 - 21:46)
the pokemon game (21:45 - 21:50)
yes yeah they owned the first four or (21:46 - 21:50)
five (21:50 - 21:53)
own or were they public they were urged (21:50 - 21:56)
to to create yeah i mean imagine if they (21:53 - 21:58)
still had it then they would be part of (21:56 - 21:59)
uh (21:58 - 22:03)
mtg arena no because (21:59 - 22:05)
i wa are we are we going to say that (22:03 - 22:07)
magic the gathering arena is a more (22:05 - 22:08)
stable (22:07 - 22:10)
and more reliable product than the (22:08 - 22:12)
pokemon trading card game online because (22:10 - 22:14)
i've heard that that client is not (22:12 - 22:17)
also so arena arena is actually very (22:14 - 22:17)
good (22:17 - 22:21)
yeah nothing wrong with arena except (22:17 - 22:22)
people who don't know how to play the (22:21 - 22:22)
game (22:22 - 22:26)
and loose (22:22 - 22:30)
i i have nev the problems that you have (22:26 - 22:33)
in washington last night (22:30 - 22:35)
i have never had any of those issues in (22:33 - 22:37)
arena yeah (22:35 - 22:38)
i think the thing that people complain (22:37 - 22:40)
about with arena is (22:38 - 22:45)
that there are they are still adding (22:40 - 22:47)
all of the cards like there are cards (22:45 - 22:48)
that are missing (22:47 - 22:50)
because magic has been around and (22:48 - 22:52)
they've just introduced the historic (22:50 - 22:55)
format and historic doesn't have all of (22:52 - 22:57)
the cards that are in historic or (22:55 - 22:58)
whatever and (22:57 - 23:00)
magic pumps out new sets and so they (22:58 - 23:02)
always focus on getting the new stuff (23:00 - 23:05)
in so there is a backlog of other stuff (23:02 - 23:07)
um (23:05 - 23:08)
and there are way there are ways to (23:07 - 23:11)
break (23:08 - 23:11)
magic the gathering arena i've watched a (23:11 - 23:16)
streamer who (23:13 - 23:16)
had like 400 things attacking (23:16 - 23:24)
and had left the when i stopped watching (23:21 - 23:26)
the client had been running for (23:24 - 23:29)
24 hours and still hadn't calculated (23:26 - 23:32)
how to do the attack it was still there (23:29 - 23:34)
it was still checking along (23:32 - 23:37)
but it hadn't changed in 24 hours (23:34 - 23:39)
because the game client was still trying (23:37 - 23:41)
to figure out how to do (23:39 - 23:43)
the damage of what had just happened on (23:41 - 23:44)
screen (23:43 - 23:46)
yeah i think people's biggest complaint (23:44 - 23:48)
about arena like (23:46 - 23:50)
i think really the largest community (23:48 - 23:51)
complaint about mtg arena (23:50 - 23:55)
is there's 327 different (23:51 - 23:58)
magic formats ways to play the game (23:55 - 24:03)
and they only have implemented like six (23:58 - 24:06)
[Laughter] (24:03 - 24:09)
the other 321 format players are like (24:06 - 24:14)
why can't my format be represented (24:09 - 24:14)
i don't i don't doubt that (24:14 - 24:20)
magic or yu-gi-oh or pokemon that the (24:18 - 24:22)
rules of a trading card game (24:20 - 24:25)
are incredibly complex and there's (24:22 - 24:28)
so many cards in the past and so many (24:25 - 24:28)
cards coming that (24:28 - 24:30)
would affect these rules in different (24:28 - 24:33)
situations across different formats (24:30 - 24:37)
um but i feel like it's not (24:33 - 24:41)
that much too it's it's not like i'm (24:37 - 24:43)
saying like i want a pokemon mmo with (24:41 - 24:46)
17 regions and 100 pokemon because that (24:43 - 24:47)
would that in reality would be a (24:46 - 24:48)
terrible game (24:47 - 24:51)
um but uh (24:48 - 24:54)
to say like i want a worldwide client (24:51 - 24:56)
because ptcgo is not worldwide (24:54 - 24:59)
there's no ptc joe in japan i would want (24:56 - 25:01)
a worldwide client across (24:59 - 25:04)
mac pc ios android (25:01 - 25:08)
and nintendo switch and it's on (25:04 - 25:11)
three of those i mean it's on ipad but (25:08 - 25:12)
it's technically not on iphone but like (25:11 - 25:13)
iphone (25:12 - 25:16)
is your biggest market for for ios like (25:13 - 25:16)
it's on (25:16 - 25:19)
android tablets but you can side load it (25:16 - 25:21)
on to android phones but again you want (25:19 - 25:24)
it to be as accessible as possible it's (25:21 - 25:25)
not on switch which (25:24 - 25:28)
it should be um it's on mac and pc (25:25 - 25:32)
um there's no japan (25:28 - 25:34)
but to have a client and then to have (25:32 - 25:36)
that client be able to translate (25:34 - 25:38)
like hey if japanese players are playing (25:36 - 25:39)
with japanese cards but they're playing (25:38 - 25:40)
an english player the game (25:39 - 25:42)
on that end just translates the car like (25:40 - 25:43)
you're now playing (25:42 - 25:45)
and like a german player bringing (25:43 - 25:46)
english you don't have to worry about (25:45 - 25:47)
reading german cards it just auto (25:46 - 25:48)
translates (25:47 - 25:50)
and then just to have like a stable (25:48 - 25:51)
client (25:50 - 25:55)
and maybe like (25:51 - 25:58)
i you know eight years ago maybe the (25:55 - 26:00)
pokemon company international was very (25:58 - 26:02)
scared of micro transactions and having (26:00 - 26:04)
players spend too much money but now we (26:02 - 26:05)
have pokemon go (26:04 - 26:08)
we have pokemon masters we have cafe mix (26:05 - 26:12)
we have pokemon quest (26:08 - 26:14)
we have all these games where even (26:12 - 26:16)
masters will yell at you if you spend (26:14 - 26:17)
too much money (26:16 - 26:20)
like masters will be like hey don't (26:17 - 26:21)
spend this much i mean you can ignore it (26:20 - 26:22)
and keep spending (26:21 - 26:25)
of course we've done our diligence so we (26:22 - 26:26)
can't get sued by throwing up a warning (26:25 - 26:28)
message saying don't spend this much kid (26:26 - 26:30)
but we we've had this conversation (26:28 - 26:33)
before where like they know (26:30 - 26:36)
that people are going to um like troll (26:33 - 26:37)
and toad or people are going to ebay and (26:36 - 26:39)
they're spending a hundred dollars for (26:37 - 26:41)
200 code cards and then they're scanning (26:39 - 26:43)
those 200 code cards in because they (26:41 - 26:43)
want (26:43 - 26:46)
code cards yeah like there is the (26:43 - 26:49)
average casual player going to target (26:46 - 26:51)
well before this drought going to target (26:49 - 26:52)
buying like a (26:51 - 26:54)
elite trainer box coming home opening (26:52 - 26:56)
the eight packs redeeming the codes (26:54 - 27:00)
maybe playing around a little but (26:56 - 27:04)
that's not like a serious forte forte is (27:00 - 27:04)
that a good word (27:04 - 27:08)
that's not like a serious (27:04 - 27:09)
like eight eight booster packs from (27:08 - 27:12)
target and you may be being like i want (27:09 - 27:13)
to get into competitive pokemon and (27:12 - 27:15)
getting eight booster packs in (27:13 - 27:18)
ptzo isn't (27:15 - 27:21)
helpful it's like okay (27:18 - 27:23)
but like if somebody wanted to get into (27:21 - 27:25)
ptc geo (27:23 - 27:28)
on the whim like having that person (27:25 - 27:29)
drive to target buy a theme that come (27:28 - 27:31)
back redeem the theme deck just (27:29 - 27:32)
like just give me an option to buy the (27:31 - 27:34)
theme deck in the game (27:32 - 27:36)
like let me just spend like two bucks or (27:34 - 27:38)
let me just let me get like (27:36 - 27:41)
50 booster packs and then i can be like (27:38 - 27:42)
i can get addicted to opening booster (27:41 - 27:44)
packs and then like okay i opened 50 (27:42 - 27:46)
i spent some money now i can build a (27:44 - 27:48)
deck or now i can trade like you can't (27:46 - 27:50)
do much with (27:48 - 27:53)
buying a handful of packs at target (27:50 - 27:54)
unless you're consistently buying a (27:53 - 27:55)
handful of packs at target (27:54 - 27:57)
but then you're already consistently (27:55 - 27:59)
ready to spend money right (27:57 - 28:04)
i i think the pokemon company's (27:59 - 28:04)
noted reluctance to online things it (28:04 - 28:09)
bears its face in this (28:07 - 28:11)
like they have never been great at (28:09 - 28:14)
online stuff they have always (28:11 - 28:17)
been so overly cautious because they (28:14 - 28:19)
know they have a large (28:17 - 28:23)
kids audience that i think it really (28:19 - 28:25)
that their sort of philosophy of not (28:23 - 28:26)
being great about (28:25 - 28:29)
online stuff out of fear just runs (28:26 - 28:31)
through (28:29 - 28:33)
everything there has to be like more (28:31 - 28:34)
kids though (28:33 - 28:39)
playing go oh more yeah yeah or like (28:34 - 28:41)
i i i would sure but like there's no (28:39 - 28:42)
communication in go (28:41 - 28:46)
like the idea is that (28:42 - 28:48)
i think how they sort of can warp their (28:46 - 28:50)
way around it is if a kid is playing go (28:48 - 28:52)
they're out with (28:50 - 28:55)
their guardian who is protecting them (28:52 - 28:58)
and there are no online inter like i (28:55 - 28:59)
can't talk to you (28:58 - 29:02)
in go i can't send you chats i can't do (28:59 - 29:02)
you can't (29:02 - 29:05)
technically talk in tcgo so (29:02 - 29:08)
you can send like emotes yeah even (29:05 - 29:09)
outside of that though (29:08 - 29:12)
the the thing is like go masters (29:09 - 29:16)
cafe mix which are the three main (29:12 - 29:18)
ways that you can spend money directly (29:16 - 29:20)
through an app right magikarp jump (29:18 - 29:23)
yep magikarp jump okay that still proves (29:20 - 29:24)
my point there (29:23 - 29:27)
uh they're all on mobile devices (29:24 - 29:31)
so for a child to have a mobile device (29:27 - 29:34)
the parent has already made the decision (29:31 - 29:37)
to give them access to a way to spend (29:34 - 29:38)
money and also (29:37 - 29:40)
mobile devices do have built-in hey (29:38 - 29:42)
you're actually not allowed to (29:40 - 29:44)
spend any money using this device right (29:42 - 29:46)
or pass code for that (29:44 - 29:48)
on the computer there is no way to do (29:46 - 29:49)
any kind of (29:48 - 29:51)
authenticated financial transaction well (29:49 - 29:53)
they would have to build something (29:51 - 29:55)
right but but yeah but i think they're (29:53 - 29:57)
just afraid to do that it's not (29:55 - 29:59)
native to the platform where it is (29:57 - 30:00)
native to (29:59 - 30:03)
the phone platforms yeah yeah i think (30:00 - 30:05)
they just don't like touching it i think (30:03 - 30:06)
they (30:05 - 30:10)
they have they've never wanted to (30:06 - 30:10)
go down that path and they let other (30:11 - 30:15)
people do it for them (30:14 - 30:18)
and i think that shows a lot in (30:15 - 30:23)
in all of their online stuff (30:18 - 30:24)
so you're never going to get it you're (30:23 - 30:26)
never going to get a good time just (30:24 - 30:28)
deal with it but but also like what if (30:26 - 30:30)
they signed like a (30:28 - 30:33)
15-year license with direwolf and (30:30 - 30:34)
they're just like literally just waiting (30:33 - 30:35)
for that to run out (30:34 - 30:37)
that's true that they can have another (30:35 - 30:38)
company start developing it (30:37 - 30:40)
and they're just like we don't want (30:38 - 30:42)
direwolf to get five percent of every (30:40 - 30:43)
transaction (30:42 - 30:45)
i mean i think the amount of money they (30:43 - 30:46)
make off of go they could probably buy (30:45 - 30:48)
direwolf out (30:46 - 30:51)
at this point wolf ain't for sale buddy (30:48 - 30:54)
sure everybody's for sale yeah but is it (30:51 - 30:56)
is it like (30:54 - 30:58)
they don't like dire wolf so they're (30:56 - 30:59)
just not giving direwolf money and (30:58 - 31:01)
they're running out that contract (30:59 - 31:05)
or i mean or (31:01 - 31:05)
what if the original contract with (31:07 - 31:10)
direwolf is like if (31:09 - 31:12)
if we are ever authorized to process (31:10 - 31:14)
financial transactions direwolf gets 80 (31:12 - 31:16)
of the transaction and the pokemon (31:14 - 31:18)
company is like heck no we're just never (31:16 - 31:18)
going to let that (31:18 - 31:20)
well that that's true the pokemon (31:18 - 31:21)
company is very (31:20 - 31:24)
good at just we will of the cadet (31:21 - 31:26)
cadaver (31:24 - 31:28)
yeah they run out the clock they they (31:26 - 31:30)
will run out any clock (31:28 - 31:32)
i don't know what i don't know what the (31:30 - 31:34)
reason would be (31:32 - 31:36)
but i mean (31:34 - 31:36)
they have to know that after this last (31:37 - 31:45)
year that client is hurting their brand (31:40 - 31:49)
and i i think they are still (31:45 - 31:53)
banking on live tournaments being their (31:49 - 31:54)
thing and not (31:53 - 31:56)
being online i think they're still (31:54 - 31:58)
banking on (31:56 - 32:01)
this being a short-term problem (31:58 - 32:04)
and going back to live events like how (32:01 - 32:06)
they want it to be (32:04 - 32:10)
i think like like as somebody who (32:06 - 32:13)
the the problem with like all live (32:10 - 32:14)
events there's (32:13 - 32:17)
there's probably that fear of like well (32:14 - 32:18)
if we (32:17 - 32:20)
if we do online events then people don't (32:18 - 32:22)
want to come to the live events (32:20 - 32:24)
and i think other industries have proven (32:22 - 32:25)
that that's not true (32:24 - 32:28)
right um and as (32:25 - 32:31)
somebody who did like like (32:28 - 32:33)
i know i know some listeners are or (32:31 - 32:35)
maybe new to the show and greg wasn't (32:33 - 32:36)
even on the show when (32:35 - 32:38)
when i was super into the trading card (32:36 - 32:40)
game will was but (32:38 - 32:42)
as somebody who seriously tried to (32:40 - 32:45)
compete in the pokemon tcg (32:42 - 32:47)
circuit back in black and white emerging (32:45 - 32:49)
powers and noble victors and all the way (32:47 - 32:51)
up to like plasma freeze and stuff (32:49 - 32:53)
that was three years of my life where (32:51 - 32:55)
every single weekend i was driving (32:53 - 32:58)
30 minutes plus up to four to five hours (32:55 - 33:00)
away (32:58 - 33:02)
to go to a tournament spend 12 hours at (33:00 - 33:04)
a tournament because they're all poorly (33:02 - 33:05)
run (33:04 - 33:07)
not have a lunch because like again (33:05 - 33:08)
they're so poorly (33:07 - 33:10)
run that they could like they're so far (33:08 - 33:11)
behind that they can't even fit into (33:10 - 33:12)
lunch break (33:11 - 33:14)
have some of the most ridiculous rules (33:12 - 33:16)
because like (33:14 - 33:19)
because the coaches or the sorry not the (33:16 - 33:20)
coaches but the like (33:19 - 33:22)
event organizers are too scared to (33:20 - 33:23)
actually like (33:22 - 33:25)
deal with confrontation and then spend (33:23 - 33:27)
another four hours back and that was (33:25 - 33:28)
your saturday and sunday (33:27 - 33:31)
and then like you did that the next (33:28 - 33:32)
weekend like i (33:31 - 33:36)
i can't remember (33:32 - 33:36)
a weekend where i wasn't on the road (33:37 - 33:42)
hating my life at like 6 a.m in the (33:40 - 33:44)
morning because i needed to be in like (33:42 - 33:46)
madison or i needed to be in lacrosse or (33:44 - 33:46)
i needed to (33:46 - 33:48)
be in like rapids to participate in (33:46 - 33:50)
a tournament and if you didn't (33:48 - 33:52)
if somebody's like well just don't go to (33:50 - 33:54)
all of them you had to (33:52 - 33:57)
because the point level was so high yes (33:54 - 34:00)
that you had to go to every single one (33:57 - 34:00)
of them (34:00 - 34:03)
just to even qualify (34:00 - 34:07)
and like you maybe you would get like (34:03 - 34:09)
oh instead of 40 people at this (34:07 - 34:11)
tournament there's only 35 (34:09 - 34:13)
but because like they were able to do at (34:11 - 34:15)
least two online tournaments and make up (34:13 - 34:16)
the points (34:15 - 34:20)
but i don't ever want to go (34:16 - 34:23)
back to being on the road for an entire (34:20 - 34:25)
season to hit up battle roads and (34:23 - 34:27)
and cities and and regionals and states (34:25 - 34:28)
and (34:27 - 34:30)
now obviously most of those don't exist (34:28 - 34:31)
anymore they changed (34:30 - 34:33)
names but back when i was doing it was (34:31 - 34:34)
like battle roads states (34:33 - 34:38)
cities regionals nationals (34:34 - 34:41)
it's just so time consuming um (34:38 - 34:43)
on top of being expensive on top of like (34:41 - 34:45)
needing the cards like when i was (34:43 - 34:48)
when i was in the format the um one of (34:45 - 34:50)
the best decks at the time was was four (34:48 - 34:52)
mewtwo's and four dark eyes (34:50 - 34:55)
eighty dollars each for those cards and (34:52 - 34:56)
it was like do i want to spend eighty (34:55 - 34:58)
dollars on eight cards (34:56 - 35:01)
or eighty dollars eight times or do i (34:58 - 35:02)
wait until after this (35:01 - 35:04)
this format is over which is in like two (35:02 - 35:05)
months and then (35:04 - 35:08)
darkram u2 are intends for 15 and it's (35:05 - 35:10)
like well that's the best deck (35:08 - 35:13)
so i'm gonna drive six hours with a deck (35:10 - 35:15)
i can't afford (35:13 - 35:17)
spend 12 hours of my weekend gas (35:15 - 35:18)
restaurants (35:17 - 35:21)
hotel all of that that's that's why i (35:18 - 35:23)
could never do competitive (35:21 - 35:25)
even though i like enjoyed it and wanted (35:23 - 35:26)
to it's just like (35:25 - 35:29)
and you had to go to the big regionals (35:26 - 35:32)
you had to you had to go at least (35:29 - 35:38)
yeah and do well on at those regionals (35:32 - 35:38)
like the fact that they they may be (35:39 - 35:43)
scared of wanting to put (35:41 - 35:46)
money into an online client is insulting (35:43 - 35:48)
to their players (35:46 - 35:51)
i'm not saying it's not i mean i'm not (35:48 - 35:53)
saying that it's not (35:51 - 35:56)
at this point is a bad business practice (35:53 - 35:57)
i'm just saying that they seem to be (35:56 - 35:58)
stuck (35:57 - 36:01)
in that mode i think they are stuck (35:58 - 36:04)
in that mindset and (36:01 - 36:04)
i i the only (36:05 - 36:11)
thing is that they've been working on a (36:09 - 36:12)
better client and they're going to (36:11 - 36:13)
unveil it one day (36:12 - 36:16)
yeah and that guy does digital the (36:13 - 36:17)
reason they're not putting money in is (36:16 - 36:18)
because they know (36:17 - 36:21)
another client is coming down the line i (36:18 - 36:24)
can't imagine the tcg (36:21 - 36:27)
is as travel difficult (36:24 - 36:30)
in japan as it is here right (36:27 - 36:34)
well no they got them bullet trains (36:30 - 36:37)
so i i still think like there is a a (36:34 - 36:37)
lack of (36:37 - 36:41)
understanding of (36:37 - 36:43)
of just like the distances it's like (36:41 - 36:44)
when people (36:43 - 36:47)
from europe are coming to visit america (36:44 - 36:48)
like we're going to be in chicago so you (36:47 - 36:49)
can come (36:48 - 36:52)
visit us right i'm like chicago is (36:49 - 36:55)
nine hours away seven hours away if i (36:52 - 36:57)
drive fast (36:55 - 37:00)
like that's not this the scope of where (36:57 - 37:01)
these things (37:00 - 37:04)
are is vastly different yeah i mean i (37:01 - 37:04)
got from (37:04 - 37:07)
osaka to tokyo in about three hours on a (37:04 - 37:08)
bullet train (37:07 - 37:11)
that was cool don't know what that means (37:08 - 37:13)
where's osaka (37:11 - 37:15)
very far north osaka is like where (37:13 - 37:17)
andrew is (37:15 - 37:22)
and that helps even less is it (37:17 - 37:22)
where does skate the infinity take place (37:26 - 37:29)
i (37:28 - 37:32)
don't know what is that it's a new anime (37:29 - 37:35)
dude about skateboarding it's real good (37:32 - 37:37)
i don't know but here here's the thing (37:35 - 37:38)
too this is this is a (37:37 - 37:43)
last point i would make i mean you have (37:38 - 37:43)
you have always had at these irl (37:43 - 37:49)
tournaments (37:46 - 37:49)
um an incredible amount of tcg players (37:49 - 37:54)
compared to video game players (37:53 - 37:57)
like the the regionals that i top cut it (37:54 - 37:58)
at (37:57 - 38:00)
which was in fort wayne indiana it was (37:58 - 38:03)
the biggest regionals of like two (38:00 - 38:04)
thousand (38:03 - 38:08)
twelve fifteen or thirteen or whatever (38:04 - 38:11)
i top cut it with dark rice ability (38:08 - 38:13)
so that was like slightly after dark (38:11 - 38:15)
explorers came out 2012. (38:13 - 38:17)
there you go it was the biggest (38:15 - 38:19)
regionals ever in the united states (38:17 - 38:21)
i don't remember i think it was 1200 (38:19 - 38:23)
players it was 1200 (38:21 - 38:26)
tcg players and then (38:23 - 38:29)
no joke there was only like uh uh like (38:26 - 38:33)
200 video game players (38:29 - 38:35)
and the video game players they came in (38:33 - 38:38)
and they were done in like four hours (38:35 - 38:40)
and i'm i'm here at like a two day long (38:38 - 38:41)
tournament (38:40 - 38:46)
12 hours a day with like no lunch break (38:41 - 38:48)
because they had so many players they (38:46 - 38:50)
just we have to go as fast as possible (38:48 - 38:51)
otherwise because we need to be done in (38:50 - 38:53)
two days (38:51 - 38:56)
and right before the pandemic happened (38:53 - 38:57)
with sword and shield (38:56 - 38:59)
there was actually like a huge amount of (38:57 - 39:02)
vgc players (38:59 - 39:02)
and the problem (39:02 - 39:12)
is like it's it the the you so it's it's (39:08 - 39:13)
obvious that there's so many people that (39:12 - 39:17)
want to participate and compete in (39:13 - 39:19)
the tcg it's been obvious for years (39:17 - 39:20)
right (39:19 - 39:22)
like it's not like this it suddenly (39:20 - 39:23)
became this new issue (39:22 - 39:25)
but the problem is you have this this (39:23 - 39:26)
client (39:25 - 39:30)
that is just awful to be in (39:26 - 39:32)
it's just not like you can't play the (39:30 - 39:33)
you can't (39:32 - 39:34)
it would be like if sword and like say (39:33 - 39:36)
what you will about certain shield if (39:34 - 39:37)
you hated the characters if you hated (39:36 - 39:38)
the story whatever (39:37 - 39:40)
but when you're playing sword and shield (39:38 - 39:42)
it doesn't feel like it's crashing or (39:40 - 39:44)
slogging or like you're trying to like (39:42 - 39:46)
select a move and it's just not clicking (39:44 - 39:46)
like (39:46 - 39:48)
at least sword and chase like i have (39:46 - 39:50)
played certain ship for almost two years (39:48 - 39:52)
i think it's crashed like twice like (39:50 - 39:53)
it's like sandwich (39:52 - 39:55)
like the game itself is is actually it (39:53 - 39:57)
works right it's it's fine yeah (39:55 - 39:59)
it does (39:57 - 39:59)
tcg is like is it even going to register (40:01 - 40:04)
the new update (40:03 - 40:08)
i mean there's like there's two (40:04 - 40:11)
uh like business problems in in decision (40:08 - 40:13)
science that i can see (40:11 - 40:18)
happening potentially one is you have (40:13 - 40:20)
people who have made a decision and they (40:18 - 40:22)
don't want to admit that it was the (40:20 - 40:23)
wrong decision (40:22 - 40:26)
and therefore rather than reevaluating (40:23 - 40:26)
they dig (40:26 - 40:30)
in and two (40:26 - 40:33)
you have a client and (40:30 - 40:35)
rather than recognizing that people are (40:33 - 40:37)
playing this because they enjoy the game (40:35 - 40:40)
and this is the only place to play it (40:37 - 40:42)
they're saying to themselves (40:40 - 40:44)
the client must be fine because we have (40:42 - 40:46)
so many people playing it (40:44 - 40:49)
yeah right and it's like i mean put the (40:46 - 40:50)
least amount of money towards the (40:49 - 40:51)
greatest (40:50 - 40:53)
return and it's like we got tons of (40:51 - 40:55)
people playing this so (40:53 - 40:56)
we don't need to toss any more money at (40:55 - 40:58)
this (40:56 - 41:00)
but you start with the client and you're (40:58 - 41:02)
like oh is this like a flash game from (41:00 - 41:03)
like (41:02 - 41:06)
20 people this is you this is you this (41:03 - 41:07)
isn't (41:06 - 41:09)
grandpa pokemon who is like oh i mean i (41:07 - 41:11)
see all the kids out there in the field (41:09 - 41:12)
playing it so (41:11 - 41:15)
we updated the wood texture it took us (41:12 - 41:17)
six years but we updated the wood (41:15 - 41:19)
texture it looks like (41:17 - 41:22)
four percent better ah gosh (41:19 - 41:24)
it's all about the trees it always comes (41:22 - 41:26)
down to the trees basically it does (41:24 - 41:27)
doesn't it (41:26 - 41:29)
all right unbelievable let's take a (41:27 - 41:30)
break (41:29 - 41:34)
we got some more pokemon news we will be (41:30 - 41:49)
right back (41:34 - 42:14)
[Music] (41:49 - 42:14)
and we are back from our break (42:16 - 42:23)
let's talk about (42:20 - 42:23)
pokemon center they added (42:23 - 42:29)
dot com pokemon center dot com they (42:26 - 42:30)
added a (42:29 - 42:35)
new collectible pikachu collection (42:30 - 42:35)
but it it looks like they're the funkos (42:36 - 42:40)
and it's presented like the funkos (42:38 - 42:42)
because they did the silhouettes (42:40 - 42:44)
and nowhere on the page does it say it's (42:42 - 42:45)
from funko (42:44 - 42:47)
you are burying the lead are we talking (42:45 - 42:48)
about the (42:47 - 42:52)
pikachu pikachu moods yeah (42:48 - 42:53)
are we going to talk about the bedtime (42:52 - 42:55)
buddy because that's the important thing (42:53 - 42:59)
bedtime buddy look at the landing page (42:55 - 43:02)
for pokemon center.com dude and tell me (42:59 - 43:06)
you're going to just sit and ignore that (43:02 - 43:06)
the massive meowth yes oh yeah there (43:06 - 43:13)
they restocked the meowth they didn't (43:10 - 43:14)
know they had never come out in the (43:13 - 43:15)
first place (43:14 - 43:17)
yeah it sold out like the first day i (43:15 - 43:20)
mean it's 300 (43:17 - 43:22)
yeah they probably only made 10 with the (43:20 - 43:23)
expectation of selling like (43:22 - 43:26)
six and then they sold all 10. it's huge (43:23 - 43:26)
it is (43:26 - 43:30)
huge 65 inches (43:26 - 43:33)
it's as big as a tv (43:30 - 43:33)
it's almost as big as me (43:33 - 43:37)
is it this is like i'm like 74 inches (43:37 - 43:44)
yeah yeah this is like the pokemon thing (43:41 - 43:45)
though right (43:44 - 43:48)
you partner with somebody good they do (43:45 - 43:49)
the job (43:48 - 43:52)
and then you you you you do it yourself (43:49 - 43:55)
later at a cheaper price but you still (43:52 - 43:56)
make the same profit (43:55 - 43:58)
right like you partner with wizards of (43:56 - 43:59)
the coast (43:58 - 44:01)
they get you off the ground then you (43:59 - 44:03)
make your own tcg so you can make more (44:01 - 44:04)
money (44:03 - 44:07)
you partner with um four kids (44:04 - 44:10)
because they know how to do anime then (44:07 - 44:11)
you do a couple seasons and then you (44:10 - 44:14)
move to a significantly cheaper anime to (44:11 - 44:14)
cut (44:14 - 44:16)
costs and to hire cheaper people and (44:14 - 44:17)
then you make more money you partner (44:16 - 44:19)
with funco because they know how to make (44:17 - 44:20)
toys (44:19 - 44:22)
they made a bunch of pikachu toys now (44:20 - 44:23)
you make this (44:22 - 44:25)
it's not as good as the funko like look (44:23 - 44:28)
at the lines on this pikachu mood sleepy (44:25 - 44:29)
figure already sold out (44:28 - 44:33)
but this is this is this looks like (44:29 - 44:34)
funko's work but it's not (44:33 - 44:37)
one cup what you're complaining about is (44:34 - 44:38)
called (44:37 - 44:40)
capitalism (44:38 - 44:40)
you're talking about that you don't like (44:41 - 44:45)
he's uh (44:43 - 44:47)
it's it's the close-ups of like the (44:45 - 44:49)
jigglypuff as you can see (44:47 - 44:51)
he's supposed to be a doll so it's (44:49 - 44:52)
supposed to be (44:51 - 44:54)
sewed like the lines are the same yeah (44:52 - 44:56)
but look at look at look at pikachu's (44:54 - 44:57)
open eye (44:56 - 44:59)
and the red circle they're they're just (44:57 - 45:01)
not painted with the precision that i (44:59 - 45:04)
want for my fifteen dollars (45:01 - 45:06)
i mean i will give you the circle and (45:04 - 45:08)
the eye like the circle (45:06 - 45:10)
is looking a little sloppy but my (45:08 - 45:12)
question is (45:10 - 45:15)
who who made the the eevee (45:12 - 45:18)
seasons those were also phone calls (45:15 - 45:20)
those were funka okay so it was the (45:18 - 45:22)
pikachu holiday or (45:20 - 45:24)
pikachu a day with pikachu yeah those (45:22 - 45:27)
are funko and then it was the eevee (45:24 - 45:29)
and these have like they look like the (45:27 - 45:30)
same bait maybe (45:29 - 45:32)
maybe it is funko it doesn't say it (45:30 - 45:33)
doesn't say on the website they the (45:32 - 45:34)
other two did (45:33 - 45:38)
it's made of resin yeah (45:34 - 45:38)
i ordered it so i guess we'll see what (45:39 - 45:42)
the quality is (45:41 - 45:44)
of course you did look i'm a fan of (45:42 - 45:46)
pikachu i like the boy (45:44 - 45:49)
you're a fan of resin you are a fan of (45:46 - 45:51)
being a sucker (45:49 - 45:53)
that if i'm going to complain on this (45:51 - 45:54)
program (45:53 - 45:57)
about a 15 non-funko product i got to (45:54 - 45:59)
put my money where my mouth (45:57 - 46:02)
no you don't what maybe maybe it's good (45:59 - 46:06)
maybe it's all right what about that (46:02 - 46:08)
picture and you complaining about that (46:06 - 46:08)
picture (46:08 - 46:10)
is going to suddenly change when you get (46:08 - 46:12)
it because (46:10 - 46:14)
they took the picture of the best one (46:12 - 46:15)
that they had (46:14 - 46:18)
it arrives and it says funko on it and (46:15 - 46:20)
maybe i'm wrong the whole maybe it is (46:18 - 46:22)
funko maybe they just forgot to update (46:20 - 46:22)
you (46:22 - 46:25)
you're just buying a product to see if (46:22 - 46:26)
it was made by funko (46:25 - 46:30)
no i'm just you just uh losing my mind (46:26 - 46:32)
you know they they showed the second (46:30 - 46:34)
part of the parade greg (46:32 - 46:37)
oh they did yeah they took it off the (46:34 - 46:38)
because because (46:37 - 46:39)
whoever's running the pokemon center dot (46:38 - 46:41)
com doesn't know how to upload and hide (46:39 - 46:42)
a product (46:41 - 46:45)
that it was like uploaded for like 45 (46:42 - 46:46)
minutes and then they had to take it (46:45 - 46:47)
back down (46:46 - 46:51)
it was an oshawott a score bunny (46:47 - 46:54)
and a rowlet and it was really cute and (46:51 - 46:55)
really awesome (46:54 - 46:57)
and now i regret not buying the first (46:55 - 46:58)
part of the trip well and you can't go (46:57 - 47:00)
back (46:58 - 47:02)
you have to go to ebay to go back but (47:00 - 47:03)
okay (47:02 - 47:06)
first of all nobody saved this image on (47:03 - 47:07)
the internet (47:06 - 47:10)
it's somewhere i'm trying to find (47:07 - 47:14)
it two okay (47:10 - 47:16)
i want everybody to pause the video and (47:14 - 47:19)
zoom in on the chaos (47:16 - 47:21)
of memorabilia that you have behind you (47:19 - 47:22)
yes (47:21 - 47:25)
yes you are going to have to move here i (47:22 - 47:26)
found it i found it (47:25 - 47:30)
five or six hours uh and you have to (47:26 - 47:31)
pack all that stuff up (47:30 - 47:33)
i'm not helping this oh the stuff behind (47:31 - 47:35)
me (47:33 - 47:39)
and you want to add more (47:35 - 47:41)
the item is i will say that like the (47:39 - 47:43)
problem with the first one (47:41 - 47:46)
wasn't that it wasn't cute i see the (47:43 - 47:47)
exact same problems (47:46 - 47:49)
here that i saw in the first one you did (47:47 - 47:51)
you didn't like the the (47:49 - 47:54)
cobblestone street i like that street (47:51 - 47:58)
oshawa weird painted yeah (47:54 - 48:02)
by the way yeah i mean the same (47:58 - 48:04)
problems that i have everybody kind of (48:02 - 48:06)
looks like it's seeing something off to (48:04 - 48:07)
the side (48:06 - 48:10)
that is horrifying that it's horrifying (48:07 - 48:10)
stopped (48:10 - 48:13)
mid-snack because it's like i can't (48:10 - 48:14)
believe (48:13 - 48:16)
what i can see with my eyes what's (48:14 - 48:18)
happening over there so (48:16 - 48:21)
if you hadn't said that this was part of (48:18 - 48:23)
the parade and there was a beginning (48:21 - 48:26)
of it this doesn't (48:23 - 48:28)
nothing about this says they're part of (48:26 - 48:30)
a longer parade (48:28 - 48:34)
it's literally three pokemon on a cart (48:30 - 48:36)
you can't have it without pikachu (48:34 - 48:37)
pikachu is leading the parade (48:36 - 48:40)
you i guarantee you pikachu will finish (48:37 - 48:41)
the parade (48:40 - 48:42)
[Laughter] (48:41 - 48:45)
you can just say it started here and it (48:42 - 48:46)
ends with pikachu they saved the best (48:45 - 48:48)
for last you don't (48:46 - 48:50)
think that this one is better than the (48:48 - 48:52)
first one no (48:50 - 48:54)
i mean i'm not working also i can't turn (48:52 - 48:56)
it around like i can't see all the (48:54 - 48:58)
things but like the wheel is wonky (48:56 - 49:02)
the oshawa's collar is wonky (48:58 - 49:03)
like there's the same things that i saw (49:02 - 49:06)
on the first one as being (49:03 - 49:08)
weird i'm still seeing on this as being (49:06 - 49:09)
weird like (49:08 - 49:11)
there's nothing about these resin models (49:09 - 49:13)
knowing that i would be in it for the (49:11 - 49:15)
long haul and then paying (49:13 - 49:18)
40 per item (49:15 - 49:21)
that makes me think i want to keep i (49:18 - 49:23)
would want to jump aboard this parade (49:21 - 49:26)
and ride it to the end (49:23 - 49:32)
porcelain or die (49:26 - 49:32)
ah this is off gizmodo gosh i haven't (49:34 - 49:39)
heard gizmodo in a while who sent this (49:37 - 49:40)
in somebody from our slack community (49:39 - 49:41)
sent this in (49:40 - 49:45)
uh robert did playing with the playing (49:41 - 49:48)
the world's largest six foot long 65 (49:45 - 49:48)
pound (49:48 - 49:50)
nintendo switch looks like an excellent (49:48 - 49:52)
workout (49:50 - 49:52)
uh michael pick is a mad scientist (49:53 - 49:57)
behind this creation that was built from (49:55 - 49:58)
a combination of plywood (49:57 - 50:01)
and used an overall shell to embiggen uh (49:58 - 50:03)
to enbig in the cost of the console (50:01 - 50:05)
oversized buttons turned out from a 3d (50:03 - 50:06)
printer and a 4k (50:05 - 50:09)
screen in the middle measuring 70 inches (50:06 - 50:10)
long (50:09 - 50:13)
pix custom switch is a 650 percent (50:10 - 50:15)
larger than the nintendo's original (50:13 - 50:17)
switch (50:15 - 50:17)
um and then it talks about how there's (50:18 - 50:21)
like a (50:21 - 50:23)
reprogrammed joy-con on the inside with (50:21 - 50:25)
an hdmi (50:23 - 50:28)
and i believe oh it does say this in the (50:25 - 50:30)
article i was gonna say maybe i need to (50:28 - 50:30)
go (50:30 - 50:32)
i had two articles but it does say it at (50:30 - 50:33)
the end um (50:32 - 50:36)
this was donated to st jude's children (50:33 - 50:38)
hospital in nashville tennessee so kids (50:36 - 50:38)
can (50:38 - 50:41)
enjoy it so the controllers don't come (50:38 - 50:42)
off (50:41 - 50:45)
right no but they no there's another (50:42 - 50:47)
video that shows he just has a pro (50:45 - 50:48)
controller hooked up to it (50:47 - 50:51)
uh so is the world's largest uh nintendo (50:48 - 50:53)
switch light (50:51 - 50:57)
um chew way to drop the ball gizmodo (50:53 - 50:59)
except that it's got two different color (50:57 - 51:03)
joy-cons yeah but they don't come off (50:59 - 51:04)
yeah i don't think they slide up and up (51:03 - 51:06)
yeah so therefore it's a nintendo switch (51:04 - 51:07)
light (51:06 - 51:09)
look it's for kids you got you put one (51:07 - 51:10)

greg question of the week uh all right (60:31 - 60:35)
hold on (60:33 - 60:35)
now's the time in the podcast for the (60:38 - 60:43)
question of the week (60:41 - 60:46)
i wonder what question will be asked (60:43 - 60:47)
it's got my (60:46 - 60:50)
interest peaked i don't know we're gonna (60:47 - 60:52)
get a second verse there i know pretty (60:50 - 60:54)
pretty well done but you can't do that (60:52 - 60:55)
song with only one verse really you (60:54 - 60:57)
really can't (60:55 - 60:59)
because people won't know what it is uh (60:57 - 61:00)
stuart (60:59 - 61:02)
from our slack says do you think there (61:00 - 61:04)
will be ever be a time where you grow (61:02 - 61:06)
out of pokemon or will you still be (61:04 - 61:08)
playing when you're 80 plus (61:06 - 61:11)
all right uh i know karate is in quotes (61:08 - 61:14)
but i'm going to do my rant (61:11 - 61:14)
you can lose interest in something i (61:16 - 61:19)
dislike (61:18 - 61:21)
the people always say are you ever going (61:19 - 61:23)
to grow out of that meaning that it's (61:21 - 61:26)
something only for children i may lose (61:23 - 61:28)
interest in something or they may do (61:26 - 61:30)
something that turns me away from the (61:28 - 61:30)
game (61:30 - 61:34)
but i don't think liking something at a (61:30 - 61:36)
young age and continuing it on (61:34 - 61:40)
is something to grow out of uh (61:36 - 61:43)
like i saw star wars as a child and i (61:40 - 61:46)
will be a star wars fan forever (61:43 - 61:48)
just because i saw it as a child doesn't (61:46 - 61:50)
mean it's childish (61:48 - 61:53)
uh but i mean is there something that (61:50 - 61:54)
they could do (61:53 - 61:59)
maybe i possibly i (61:54 - 62:00)
i mean there are there are i go through (61:59 - 62:02)
phases where i just don't want to play (62:00 - 62:03)
pokemon like i'm just not (62:02 - 62:06)
into it right now uh but i always come (62:03 - 62:07)
back to it (62:06 - 62:10)
so will they do something or will there (62:07 - 62:11)
come a time where i just (62:10 - 62:15)
straight up lose interest possibly (62:11 - 62:17)
it doesn't seem likely given my (62:15 - 62:19)
personality since i tend to hold on to (62:17 - 62:20)
things forever (62:19 - 62:21)
[Music] (62:20 - 62:24)
but i mean they may take the game in in (62:21 - 62:26)
ways that i don't enjoy (62:24 - 62:29)
uh and that's fine but i i do not think (62:26 - 62:31)
there'll be a time where i will (62:29 - 62:34)
completely lose interest in pokemon (62:31 - 62:34)
right (62:34 - 62:36)
like you're not going to get to an age (62:34 - 62:38)
where you're like well now i only read (62:36 - 62:38)
perused (62:38 - 62:40)
right i don't i don't play video games (62:38 - 62:42)
anymore i mean my eyes will probably (62:40 - 62:44)
give out and i can't see it anymore (62:42 - 62:46)
that is the most likely scenario on that (62:44 - 62:48)
path definitely (62:46 - 62:51)
um i mean yeah i i i think that that the (62:48 - 62:53)
term grow out should only be (62:51 - 62:56)
used for like i used to play with (62:53 - 62:59)
duplo and now i've grown out of duplos (62:56 - 63:02)
and i can play with the actual legos yes (62:59 - 63:05)
right uh will i ever get tired of (63:02 - 63:06)
pokemon (63:05 - 63:09)
i mean who knows right yeah who knows (63:06 - 63:10)
what the future will bring (63:09 - 63:13)
yeah i highly highly doubt it if they (63:10 - 63:14)
stopped (63:13 - 63:16)
creating new content new games and they (63:14 - 63:18)
were like (63:16 - 63:21)
we are done we are getting this concept (63:18 - 63:23)
if they themselves stop then i will if (63:21 - 63:25)
they hit their 25th anniversary and are (63:23 - 63:27)
like we are so done with this concept we (63:25 - 63:28)
can't even celebrate our own 25th (63:27 - 63:29)
anniversary (63:28 - 63:33)
then i would look still look back fondly (63:29 - 63:34)
on (63:33 - 63:37)
my experiences with the franchise but (63:34 - 63:39)
otherwise there's always something new (63:37 - 63:41)
around the corner yeah something new to (63:39 - 63:42)
enjoy (63:41 - 63:44)
i mean even when i didn't like omega (63:42 - 63:46)
ruby off of sapphire and i only got to (63:44 - 63:48)
like the (63:46 - 63:50)
third gym or fourth gym and i was like i (63:48 - 63:52)
don't like this like i still liked (63:50 - 63:52)
pokemon (63:52 - 63:54)
there's just other things in pokemon (63:52 - 63:56)
that i went to instead (63:54 - 63:59)
i mean they are good expansive brand (63:56 - 63:59)
right (63:59 - 64:02)
like they have kept the quote-unquote (63:59 - 64:05)
fad alive for 25 years now (64:02 - 64:07)
and they've shifted their marketing to (64:05 - 64:08)
age with (64:07 - 64:10)
the people who have grown up and they (64:08 - 64:12)
recognize hey people have grown up (64:10 - 64:14)
and enjoyed our products so you know (64:12 - 64:16)
what we're going to do fancy business (64:14 - 64:16)
shirts (64:16 - 64:18)
expensive business shirts custom you (64:16 - 64:20)
need this (64:18 - 64:23)
i always sort of they have a similar (64:20 - 64:27)
marketing strategy to disney like disney (64:23 - 64:30)
is very much geared towards (64:27 - 64:33)
a young audience for the basis of their (64:30 - 64:34)
films right like they are (64:33 - 64:37)
g-rated films for the most part (64:34 - 64:39)
but they are very good at still making (64:37 - 64:41)
things in those films relevant for (64:39 - 64:42)
adults (64:41 - 64:44)
so that adults can still very much enjoy (64:42 - 64:46)
that product (64:44 - 64:48)
um like how many well i know this is (64:46 - 64:50)
pixar but like how many (64:48 - 64:52)
like eight-year-olds understood the (64:50 - 64:54)
first 20 minutes of up (64:52 - 64:56)
right maybe it was like 10 minutes it's (64:54 - 64:58)
like 10 minutes and it is a rough 10 (64:56 - 65:00)
minutes (64:58 - 65:04)
yeah but yeah like i think they are good (65:00 - 65:06)
at both companies are very good at (65:04 - 65:07)
finding (65:06 - 65:10)
the all ages line that works right like (65:07 - 65:11)
there is stuff that (65:10 - 65:14)
that adults can pick up and understand (65:11 - 65:15)
at a deeper level (65:14 - 65:18)
that are still a part of the movie like (65:15 - 65:21)
pixar's soul is a very very good film (65:18 - 65:23)
and there are themes in there that (65:21 - 65:24)
really only resonate with adults (65:23 - 65:26)
but the concept and what happens in the (65:24 - 65:29)
movie still resonates with (65:26 - 65:31)
a younger audience like they're very (65:29 - 65:33)
good at straddling i think pokemon is (65:31 - 65:36)
very good at straddling uh all ages and (65:33 - 65:38)
doing all ages well (65:36 - 65:39)
well they've said multiple times in (65:38 - 65:41)
interviews that (65:39 - 65:43)
when they make a new pokemon game they (65:41 - 65:45)
think about new (65:43 - 65:48)
players coming in right and (65:45 - 65:52)
i think that's why maybe people have (65:48 - 65:54)
nostalgia for the first game they play (65:52 - 65:55)
we were talking about this before the (65:54 - 65:57)
show of how people will be like oh my (65:55 - 65:59)
favorite game is the first game i played (65:57 - 66:01)
they did a really good job at capturing (65:59 - 66:02)
you right and they (66:01 - 66:04)
they can't recreate that again right (66:02 - 66:06)
like if your first game was diamond and (66:04 - 66:07)
pearl (66:06 - 66:09)
and then your second game was x and y (66:07 - 66:11)
you will never have that same feeling (66:09 - 66:13)
that you had with diamond pearl there's (66:11 - 66:15)
there's no game company (66:13 - 66:18)
movie whatever can have you can (66:15 - 66:20)
recapture (66:18 - 66:23)
that first initial thought or experience (66:20 - 66:26)
sorry right um and people are actively (66:23 - 66:29)
making themselves unhappy trying to (66:26 - 66:30)
chase that first initial thing that'll (66:29 - 66:33)
never happen again yeah but that's not (66:30 - 66:33)
to say (66:33 - 66:36)
that they don't care about their old (66:33 - 66:37)
fans (66:36 - 66:39)
right because they include so many (66:37 - 66:41)
things to (66:39 - 66:43)
help old fans still enjoy the games (66:41 - 66:44)
whether that's (66:43 - 66:48)
uh like bottle caps or the battle tower (66:44 - 66:52)
or um updating all the ability like (66:48 - 66:54)
the the mechanical things that that like (66:52 - 66:55)
a new fan wouldn't even notice or like a (66:54 - 66:57)
new fans wouldn't be like oh (66:55 - 67:00)
you didn't have bottle caps 10 years ago (66:57 - 67:00)
yeah (67:00 - 67:03)
like the things that aren't as impactful (67:00 - 67:04)
than new people (67:03 - 67:06)
right like quality of life changes (67:04 - 67:08)
aren't impactful on new people because (67:06 - 67:11)
they don't have a quality of life (67:08 - 67:14)
experience with a series of games like (67:11 - 67:15)
this is their new game (67:14 - 67:16)
and this is how that game runs so (67:15 - 67:19)
quality of life changes are very much (67:16 - 67:20)
for old fans (67:19 - 67:23)
like we have updated this aspect to make (67:20 - 67:25)
this easier (67:23 - 67:27)
for long-term fans of the game like and (67:25 - 67:29)
they're very good at doing that (67:27 - 67:33)
and sometimes they cut stuff (67:29 - 67:37)
that um a very (67:33 - 67:40)
vocal slash very small percent of fans (67:37 - 67:44)
enjoy but um that would be like (67:40 - 67:46)
for example like the battle frontier or (67:44 - 67:47)
star (67:46 - 67:50)
yes like they said that they put a lot (67:47 - 67:51)
of work in the battle frontier and they (67:50 - 67:52)
saw that almost (67:51 - 67:54)
they saw that a lot of players never (67:52 - 67:57)
interacted with it and so because (67:54 - 67:58)
players didn't interact with it they (67:57 - 68:00)
they didn't want to put the amount of (67:58 - 68:02)
time but those players that did interact (68:00 - 68:03)
with it (68:02 - 68:06)
are very very vocal (68:03 - 68:09)
um it's like it's a shame that some of (68:06 - 68:11)
those things don't get explored more (68:09 - 68:13)
but again anything that's post game is (68:11 - 68:15)
always (68:13 - 68:19)
going to be uh for the (68:15 - 68:22)
for the smallest version the smallest (68:19 - 68:24)
population of players right yeah like (68:22 - 68:26)
credits roll (68:24 - 68:28)
done with game yeah post game stuff is (68:26 - 68:30)
always going to be a minority of players (68:28 - 68:34)
uh and i i do think of post game stuff (68:30 - 68:35)
battle frontier was one of the best ones (68:34 - 68:37)
they ever did um (68:35 - 68:41)
but again anything that like you can (68:37 - 68:42)
never rely on anything b (68:41 - 68:45)
that's post game sticking around unless (68:42 - 68:47)
is a catching mechanic and even then (68:45 - 68:49)
that's question like (68:47 - 68:52)
friend safaris have never come back (68:49 - 68:54)
right (68:52 - 68:54)
it's post game stuff you can never rely (68:54 - 68:59)
post on post game stuff coming back (68:56 - 69:01)
which is what i wonder why maybe they (68:59 - 69:03)
moved the legendary to post game (69:01 - 69:05)
like in sword and shield because it then (69:03 - 69:06)
makes you (69:05 - 69:08)
because you want the legendary right (69:06 - 69:10)
yeah well i mean mewtwo is technically (69:08 - 69:11)
post game four (69:10 - 69:14)
that's true true yeah like they do keep (69:11 - 69:15)
like (69:14 - 69:17)
a catching mechanic post post game and (69:15 - 69:19)
those are usually (69:17 - 69:22)
easy to do right away you get them you (69:19 - 69:23)
get introduced some to some (69:22 - 69:25)
incredible well that's not safe easy i (69:23 - 69:28)
mean like rayquaza deoxys was like three (69:25 - 69:30)
hours to like get through that it's like (69:28 - 69:31)
jeez i just want (69:30 - 69:34)
not that hard and you got to meet a very (69:31 - 69:36)
important character (69:34 - 69:38)
yes he becomes important in masters (69:36 - 69:41)
later so he's cool (69:38 - 69:41)
it's one of my favorite things ever was (69:44 - 69:49)
when um like on the playstation there's (69:47 - 69:50)
trophies (69:49 - 69:52)
and so i remember like playing destiny (69:50 - 69:53)
and you could see (69:52 - 69:57)
like only 80 percent of people (69:53 - 69:59)
got this far in the game because you (69:57 - 70:01)
could tell by the trophies and i (69:59 - 70:04)
i i think the best part of destiny (70:01 - 70:07)
was when they introduced the raid which (70:04 - 70:09)
was vault of glass (70:07 - 70:13)
and for like the first year (70:09 - 70:15)
of that game being out if you were to (70:13 - 70:17)
look at how many people completed vault (70:15 - 70:19)
of glass it was like (70:17 - 70:23)
two percent of all playstation players (70:19 - 70:26)
but that was legit the best part of (70:23 - 70:27)
destiny (70:26 - 70:30)
and only two out of a hundred people (70:27 - 70:32)
it's the battlefront probably able to (70:30 - 70:34)
experience that yeah and (70:32 - 70:35)
as like destiny became like a (70:34 - 70:37)
three-year-old game i think that number (70:35 - 70:37)
eventually (70:37 - 70:39)
topped out at like 20 percent because (70:37 - 70:40)
they like made it (70:39 - 70:43)
easier to get into and stuff but also (70:40 - 70:45)
that was like a living game like they (70:43 - 70:46)
were updating at every (70:45 - 70:49)
i mean and that also happens with like (70:46 - 70:51)
final fantasy 14 there are some of the (70:49 - 70:52)
best dungeons (70:51 - 70:55)
aren't mandatory they're you know late (70:52 - 70:56)
in the game after people have completed (70:55 - 70:57)
the main quest (70:56 - 70:59)
and then people just drop off until the (70:57 - 71:01)
next expansion (70:59 - 71:03)
but some of the best dungeons are not (71:01 - 71:05)
mandatory dungeons they're just super (71:03 - 71:07)
fun to do (71:05 - 71:09)
and i think that's just the life cycle (71:07 - 71:11)
of (71:09 - 71:14)
keeping your hardcore players (71:11 - 71:16)
happy is always going to be like (71:14 - 71:17)
hardcore (71:16 - 71:19)
players like your hardcore fans are (71:17 - 71:20)
always going to be the minority of (71:19 - 71:23)
people who play your games (71:20 - 71:23)
going back to the question of will you (71:25 - 71:28)
ever grow out of pokemon (71:26 - 71:32)
my mom said this to me multiple times (71:28 - 71:34)
[Laughter] (71:32 - 71:37)
and before pokemon go it was a very (71:34 - 71:38)
common thing of like (71:37 - 71:40)
what are you gonna grow out of pokemon (71:38 - 71:41)
and then as soon as she started playing (71:40 - 71:42)
pokemon go (71:41 - 71:45)
that that that expression left her (71:42 - 71:47)
vocabulary (71:45 - 71:49)
my mom used to say to me all the time (71:47 - 71:52)
she just get mad that i play video games (71:49 - 71:56)
and so i would for her birthday buy her (71:52 - 71:59)
handheld games like oh you know just (71:56 - 72:01)
something to do in your spare time (71:59 - 72:03)
and then two months later she would send (72:01 - 72:05)
me angry voice messages like how dare (72:03 - 72:07)
you get me addicted to these things (72:05 - 72:09)
and i'm like this is what you can't you (72:07 - 72:11)
can't tell me to stop playing these (72:09 - 72:12)
super fun things (72:11 - 72:15)
when the minute that you have one you (72:12 - 72:17)
can't put it down (72:15 - 72:19)
she was addicted to testress for a long (72:17 - 72:20)
time (72:19 - 72:22)
and pac-man about our mini pac-man (72:20 - 72:23)
machine and (72:22 - 72:24)
she's like you have to buy me another (72:23 - 72:27)
one because i broke it (72:24 - 72:30)
because i played it too much (72:27 - 72:34)
i think i mean (72:30 - 72:34)
i always want to ask sports sport ball (72:34 - 72:39)
watchers like football players when (72:37 - 72:40)
you're going to grow out of football (72:39 - 72:42)
yeah right when are you going to grow (72:40 - 72:44)
out of these things you played those as (72:42 - 72:44)
a kid (72:44 - 72:46)
when are you going to grow out about (72:44 - 72:47)
liking cars right when are you going to (72:46 - 72:49)
grow out of that (72:47 - 72:52)
like you may eventually lose (72:49 - 72:56)
interest sure every things change i may (72:52 - 72:58)
eventually lose interest in pokemon it (72:56 - 72:59)
could happen (72:58 - 73:01)
i do not see that as a as a likely (72:59 - 73:03)
outcome (73:01 - 73:06)
uh because i'm clearly (73:03 - 73:09)
a huge fan of the show that i can talk (73:06 - 73:11)
about it for an hour and a half (73:09 - 73:15)
every week without without a problem (73:11 - 73:19)
uh i don't i don't foresee that being (73:15 - 73:22)
a likely outcome (73:19 - 73:22)
will what is our pokemon of the week (73:23 - 73:27)
well the pokemon of the week from (73:25 - 73:30)
last week it was very short (73:27 - 73:33)
and i wanna i almost feel like going (73:30 - 73:35)
into school teacher mode about once (73:33 - 73:37)
again (73:35 - 73:37)
listen to all the words because a lot of (73:37 - 73:42)
people made assumptions (73:40 - 73:44)
because they left out some of the words (73:42 - 73:45)
but i'll just read the whole thing again (73:44 - 73:47)
because it was really short (73:45 - 73:50)
a is for the ability thick fat p is for (73:47 - 73:51)
purple shiny (73:50 - 73:55)
r is for the region hoenn i is for ice (73:51 - 73:55)
ball (73:55 - 74:01)
l is for lower brine cave it is always (73:55 - 74:04)
the last line that's the most important (74:01 - 74:07)
it's flapple (74:04 - 74:08)
[Music] (74:07 - 74:11)
no that needs to be one there are no (74:08 - 74:13)
flapples in hoenn (74:11 - 74:14)
there aren't (74:13 - 74:17)
[Music] (74:14 - 74:17)
w-a-l-r-e-i-n yeah it's probably (74:21 - 74:28)
wall for walrus yes rain foreign (74:24 - 74:31)
no exactly although i'm going to argue (74:28 - 74:32)
that i think like (74:31 - 74:34)
it's shiny looks more pink than purple (74:32 - 74:35)
to me but that is (74:34 - 74:37)
ah that's a piece we'll go let's go with (74:35 - 74:40)
the p yes (74:37 - 74:40)
piece is a good one while rain is based (74:40 - 74:43)
on a wall risk good trivia (74:42 - 74:47)
thanks there's really (74:43 - 74:50)
no trivia for walls (74:47 - 74:50)
wall raid may be a combination of walrus (74:51 - 74:55)
and the corruption of rain (74:53 - 74:58)
or rain (74:55 - 74:58)
this is a gen 3 pokemon right yeah and (74:58 - 75:04)
it's one that appears in a lot of things (75:02 - 75:08)
it has got a excellent shuffle (75:04 - 75:11)
and a very very good shiny uh i (75:08 - 75:14)
don't care about wall rain but man's (75:11 - 75:15)
feel is a winner (75:14 - 75:19)
yeah true true but there are no smiles (75:15 - 75:20)
in lower brian (75:19 - 75:22)
cave friends why is spheal a winner and (75:20 - 75:23)
walray not (75:22 - 75:25)
what is it because it's just a big round (75:23 - 75:27)
boy it's the big big yeah oh yeah yeah (75:25 - 75:28)
he's a ball (75:27 - 75:31)
he's a big old ball i mean wolverine is (75:28 - 75:31)
cool (75:31 - 75:35)
uh but if you like come on (75:31 - 75:38)
it's feel there's no competition (75:35 - 75:40)
are we all just going to ignore celia in (75:38 - 75:43)
the middle yeah it's actually all right (75:40 - 75:46)
it's like celio (75:43 - 75:49)
is this is what i'll say if we look at (75:46 - 75:50)
other seal (75:49 - 75:54)
families we got seal s-e-e-l (75:50 - 75:56)
peak peak creativity they really knocked (75:54 - 75:58)
it out of the park (75:56 - 76:01)
with that one we got seal into dugong (75:58 - 76:02)
and we got (76:01 - 76:05)
into celio and celio is at least (76:02 - 76:06)
something (76:05 - 76:09)
dugong is like nothing (76:06 - 76:09)
is one of the most bland pokemon (76:09 - 76:15)
ever that's going to be pokemon of the (76:13 - 76:17)
week in two weeks just (76:15 - 76:21)

them like papaya was awesome (76:47 - 76:54)
i thought popplio was a dog yeah popular (76:49 - 76:54)
i mean at least dugong is based off of (76:54 - 77:00)
