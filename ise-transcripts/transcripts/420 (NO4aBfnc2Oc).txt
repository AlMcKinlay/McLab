going out in a blaze of glory well (2:34 - 2:38)
there you go you said it bud all right (2:36 - 2:40)
well we got a lot of (2:38 - 2:43)
uh news this week (2:40 - 2:46)
and uh we recorded right before pokemon (2:43 - 2:47)
go fest (2:46 - 2:49)
so we didn't give you our thoughts or (2:47 - 2:50)
impressions on go fest (2:49 - 2:54)
i guess i guess we'll just start there (2:50 - 2:58)
uh there is a makeup hour (2:54 - 3:01)
well it's like three hours for go fest (2:58 - 3:03)
so this is off niantic's website pokemon (3:01 - 3:05)
pokemongolive.com (3:03 - 3:06)
due to technical issues that occurred (3:05 - 3:09)
during go fest habitat blocks that would (3:06 - 3:10)
be uh saturday (3:09 - 3:12)
we are holding a makeup event on august (3:10 - 3:15)
16th from 11 to 2 local time (3:12 - 3:16)
during this makeup event some pokemon (3:15 - 3:18)
featured during the event will (3:16 - 3:21)
be featured more frequently note this (3:18 - 3:22)
makeup event is (3:21 - 3:24)
only for people who purchased a go (3:22 - 3:26)
ticket pokemon featured during the go (3:24 - 3:28)
fest water fire and friendship habitats (3:26 - 3:30)
will be appearing more in the wild (3:28 - 3:32)
incense will be more effective certain (3:30 - 3:34)
pokemon will only appear when tracted by (3:32 - 3:34)
incense (3:34 - 3:37)
which i think was mostly unknown uh (3:34 - 3:38)
there will be a special free box (3:37 - 3:40)
including two incense (3:38 - 3:43)
and two remote raid passes give you a (3:40 - 3:46)
three hour event give you two incense (3:43 - 3:48)
please no players can claim these box (3:46 - 3:50)
only if they have fewer than three (3:48 - 3:52)
remote raid passes in their bag (3:50 - 3:54)
gifts opening during the event will (3:52 - 3:56)
contain rare candy (3:54 - 3:58)
incense will last for one hour so at 11 (3:56 - 3:59)
it will be the fire (3:58 - 4:02)
biome 12 will be water and one will be (3:59 - 4:03)
friendship (4:02 - 4:04)
i believe if you remember correctly the (4:03 - 4:06)
battle biome included gibbel (4:04 - 4:08)
i guess we're not getting gibble unless (4:06 - 4:10)
they actually slightly change it but (4:08 - 4:12)
they don't say they're doing that (4:10 - 4:13)
thank you for your understanding and (4:12 - 4:15)
your appreciation for your continued (4:13 - 4:17)
passion of pokemon go (4:15 - 4:18)
well i'm happy they're doing this as i (4:17 - 4:21)
did not get to play any of go fest (4:18 - 4:23)
so and i did buy a ticket you spent that (4:21 - 4:24)
15 bucks up (4:23 - 4:26)
i certainly did you still have your (4:24 - 4:28)
quest lines though right (4:26 - 4:30)
yes i do did they make them easier or is (4:28 - 4:31)
it the same (4:30 - 4:34)
uh it's all like get 20 of this get to (4:31 - 4:35)
you know that so (4:34 - 4:36)
i don't think they made it any easier (4:35 - 4:38)
okay all right well uh (4:36 - 4:41)
in about two years when you get your (4:38 - 4:42)
victimized (4:41 - 4:44)
i'm sure someone will trade me a victini (4:42 - 4:46)
if i really want one you can't trade (4:44 - 4:49)
you can't trade victims oh no (4:46 - 4:52)
you're locked out well there you go i (4:49 - 4:53)
mean i'll get it eventually get my genus (4:52 - 4:54)
act (4:53 - 4:56)
well genesect's coming back to raids too (4:54 - 4:58)
you should work on your genesect quest (4:56 - 5:00)
i'm like at the final step but don't (4:58 - 5:02)
redeem your genesect until genocide week (5:00 - 5:03)
starts (5:02 - 5:04)
because then you'll have the chance for (5:03 - 5:07)
a shiny oh that's the 200 iq (5:04 - 5:09)
i don't think i'm close to finishing up (5:07 - 5:10)
the genesect (5:09 - 5:12)
real quick which one what is what is it (5:10 - 5:15)

i streamed go fest so thank you to (5:27 - 5:32)
everyone who came out i purchased (5:30 - 5:34)
a lot of equipment to do that and it it (5:32 - 5:36)
worked uh (5:34 - 5:37)
but i did i watched some of it yeah it (5:36 - 5:39)
worked better than i thought minus (5:37 - 5:42)
uh sunday sunday we had way more (5:39 - 5:43)
technical issues than saturday but (5:42 - 5:44)
saturday was good (5:43 - 5:46)
so i i have my thoughts and opinions i (5:44 - 5:48)
went to this was my fourth go fest i (5:46 - 5:49)
went to all of them (5:48 - 5:53)
greg this was your first sec (5:49 - 5:53)
with us last year last year oh yeah did (5:53 - 5:57)
you guys share a hotel room (5:56 - 6:01)
we did oh wow i can't even believe (5:57 - 6:05)
the stab in my back oh so (6:01 - 6:08)
tired you are so awful i'm crushed (6:05 - 6:12)
no this is my doing my second (6:08 - 6:15)
this is my second and not as good as (6:12 - 6:18)
my first go fest oh you didn't like it (6:15 - 6:19)
as much (6:18 - 6:21)
well when i was alone because my (6:19 - 6:22)
standard go fest (6:21 - 6:25)
partner went to a wedding yeah sorry (6:22 - 6:26)
about that (6:25 - 6:29)
and all my other people were like we're (6:26 - 6:32)
not leaving the house (6:29 - 6:34)
uh so i went to the art park by myself (6:32 - 6:36)
um there was a lot of people playing (6:34 - 6:37)
there so (6:36 - 6:40)
as usual like i didn't miss out on any (6:37 - 6:42)
of the things (6:40 - 6:44)
just without one it's just not as much (6:42 - 6:45)
fun (6:44 - 6:47)
if you're by yourself yes like walking (6:45 - 6:48)
around the park it's just like (6:47 - 6:51)
i mean here i am well it can be if you (6:48 - 6:52)
if you like (6:51 - 6:54)
queue up with podcasts and stuff and (6:52 - 6:55)
you're just in the zone where you're (6:54 - 6:56)
like (6:55 - 6:58)
yeah i mean i was i was there i was you (6:56 - 6:59)
know (6:58 - 7:02)
i was in my doing my own stuff uh it's (6:59 - 7:03)
also harder because you can't get close (7:02 - 7:05)
to people to find out what they're doing (7:03 - 7:08)
like it's just a weird time to like as (7:05 - 7:10)
like hollering across are you doing this (7:08 - 7:12)
raid because you don't want to get near (7:10 - 7:12)
them (7:12 - 7:15)
i was a little like i felt like the (7:12 - 7:17)
hour-long biomes was (7:15 - 7:20)
too much regular go fest i could walk (7:17 - 7:21)
between them like oh i have a thing to (7:20 - 7:22)
go do this (7:21 - 7:24)
i'll walk down there and i was moving (7:22 - 7:26)
and i was doing other things and i was (7:24 - 7:27)
making choices (7:26 - 7:29)
this one since it was every hour it was (7:27 - 7:30)
like well i've caught (7:29 - 7:32)
what i need and now i have to wait out (7:30 - 7:34)
another (7:32 - 7:36)
half an hour so i'm just gonna keep (7:34 - 7:37)
walking and trying to find chinese which (7:36 - 7:38)
i found (7:37 - 7:41)
exactly zero the entire weekend i would (7:38 - 7:42)
maybe have liked it if it would have (7:41 - 7:45)
cut over every half hour or 45 minutes (7:42 - 7:46)
just so that we got to see all the (7:45 - 7:48)
things cycle more (7:46 - 7:50)
i thought the quests were fine like they (7:48 - 7:52)
weren't difficult to do (7:50 - 7:55)
i was out walking around it was just (7:52 - 7:57)
due to the state of the world not as (7:55 - 8:00)
much fun i didn't i can't say (7:57 - 8:02)
my only complaints i felt that the (8:00 - 8:03)
biomes lasted too long (8:02 - 8:06)
yeah i liked the our biome but when you (8:03 - 8:07)
when you compare it to (8:06 - 8:09)
if you didn't go to go fest there are (8:07 - 8:11)
biomes that exist and so if you want (8:09 - 8:14)
irene really wanted to banari last year (8:11 - 8:16)
but the benari was only spawning like (8:14 - 8:20)
next to the snow biome yeah (8:16 - 8:22)
it wasn't i wanted the she hung out a (8:20 - 8:23)
lot over there (8:22 - 8:24)
i was trying to catch a shiny rosalia so (8:23 - 8:27)
i spent like four hours walking around (8:24 - 8:28)
the grass biome (8:27 - 8:30)
and uh will really wanted shiny abra so (8:28 - 8:32)
he was hanging out in the trading biome (8:30 - 8:34)
even though abra was not technical well (8:32 - 8:36)
it was shiny for about like 10 minutes (8:34 - 8:38)
and then they turned it off (8:36 - 8:38)
but it's also a different like it's such (8:39 - 8:42)
a different (8:41 - 8:45)
vibe than all of these people coming to (8:42 - 8:46)
one location (8:45 - 8:48)
and that energy of everybody being (8:46 - 8:50)
excited and for sure doing the same (8:48 - 8:51)
thing (8:50 - 8:54)
whereas me walking alone in a park with (8:51 - 8:57)
with everybody on their phones it was (8:54 - 8:58)
hard to be like (8:57 - 9:01)
are you doing you doing the thing are (8:58 - 9:01)
you (9:01 - 9:04)
i can't get close to you to look (9:01 - 9:07)
yeah so then the question is greg did (9:04 - 9:09)
you think it was worth 15 bucks (9:07 - 9:12)
i thought 15 bucks was too expensive is (9:09 - 9:14)
victini not worth fifteen dollars to you (9:12 - 9:15)
greg (9:14 - 9:18)
victini's worth twenty dollars i mean (9:15 - 9:21)
you also gotta me too i did yeah (9:18 - 9:23)
from the battle stuff did you not get (9:21 - 9:25)
your mewtwo (9:23 - 9:28)
oh yeah i did i forgot about that (9:25 - 9:31)
i already have you two yeah but not a (9:28 - 9:33)
shadow mewtwo (9:31 - 9:37)
no i purified it so i don't (9:33 - 9:37)
again here comes the sulfur not to get (9:38 - 9:42)
you (9:41 - 9:45)
well what are they gonna do i i (9:42 - 9:48)
a person who enjoyed my (9:45 - 9:51)
xd's gales of darknesses know the power (9:48 - 9:53)
of opening my pokemon's heart to (9:51 - 9:55)
friendship again (9:53 - 9:57)
and that is what i do because my pokemon (9:55 - 9:58)
and i are friends (9:57 - 10:00)
not tools like you two treat them and (9:58 - 10:02)
keep them shadowy and evil i thought (10:00 - 10:05)
friendship is (10:02 - 10:05)
you know i couldn't say that i didn't i (10:06 - 10:10)
didn't leave the event thinking (10:08 - 10:13)
well i was ripped off 15 is fine again (10:10 - 10:14)
it's like (10:13 - 10:16)
it's kind of like the pokemon home issue (10:14 - 10:17)
like (10:16 - 10:20)
wow it's at the very upper limit of what (10:17 - 10:22)
i would have been willing to pay (10:20 - 10:24)
i think although i do like the i do like (10:22 - 10:25)
the victinish (10:24 - 10:28)
stuff that came yeah at the end like i (10:25 - 10:30)
forgot you were getting 15 (10:28 - 10:33)
at the end i was like oh (10:30 - 10:35)
this is the same for uh like the reggie (10:33 - 10:36)
gigas or the (10:35 - 10:39)
or the genesect of you know is is a (10:36 - 10:40)
single pokemon worth (10:39 - 10:42)
this amount of money but i think a lot (10:40 - 10:43)
of times people forget (10:42 - 10:45)
you get the stardust you get the (10:43 - 10:47)
experience you get the (10:45 - 10:50)
more rare pokemon like for the genesect (10:47 - 10:52)
event i think you got durant and (10:50 - 10:54)
the hey uh eight dollars is cheaper than (10:52 - 10:56)
flying too (10:54 - 10:58)
yeah i'm glad all that experience can (10:56 - 11:00)
help me pay my rent (10:58 - 11:04)
oh my gosh but i i think of it like uh (11:00 - 11:05)
like going to a state fair going to a (11:04 - 11:07)
movie uh (11:05 - 11:10)
and i think that the the 15 for me (11:07 - 11:11)
definitely felt (11:10 - 11:14)
like i got my money's worth i did like (11:11 - 11:17)
that both days felt different both days (11:14 - 11:19)
felt different i was a little no (11:17 - 11:22)
annoyed the second day trying to find (11:19 - 11:23)
the right (11:22 - 11:26)
generals to fight like spending 15 (11:23 - 11:27)
minutes oh the team leaders (11:26 - 11:30)
throw up the hunts to find them no that (11:27 - 11:31)
is not thrilling (11:30 - 11:33)
that is me stomping around and hoping (11:31 - 11:35)
that this time the balloon (11:33 - 11:38)
or the stop that has suddenly finally (11:35 - 11:40)
shown up will have the right person (11:38 - 11:43)
like i was stuck in a sierra arlo loop (11:40 - 11:43)
for (11:43 - 11:47)
an hour and a half it's very frustrating (11:43 - 11:48)
i sat in my car though at that point i'm (11:47 - 11:50)
like you know what i i need some easy (11:48 - 11:51)
because it was (11:50 - 11:54)
a war oh my god sunday was incredibly (11:51 - 11:55)
hot (11:54 - 11:58)
it was i was dripping sweat (11:55 - 12:00)
yeah it was real unpleasant down in (11:58 - 12:03)
kentucky too don't you mind (12:00 - 12:03)
i mean i think unlike go fast (12:04 - 12:08)
last year which was like you paid for (12:07 - 12:09)
one day and then you did everything that (12:08 - 12:10)
one day which was (12:09 - 12:13)
like 25 bucks yeah having the two was (12:10 - 12:14)
fine (12:13 - 12:17)
like it i was a little reluctant to go (12:14 - 12:18)
back out on sunday because i was (12:17 - 12:22)
very worn out from spending six hours in (12:18 - 12:22)
the sun (12:22 - 12:25)
on saturday i was like oh do i really (12:22 - 12:26)
want to do this but (12:25 - 12:28)
i'm like i could sit home but then it (12:26 - 12:31)
would literally i would be on my phone (12:28 - 12:32)
for probably the eight hours trying to (12:31 - 12:34)
get everything done so i was like i'll (12:32 - 12:34)
just go (12:34 - 12:36)
to the park and i'll be able to do it in (12:34 - 12:38)
three hours which (12:36 - 12:41)
took me four but whatever i mean (12:38 - 12:45)
i enjoyed it i again all of these things (12:41 - 12:48)
are i look at all these community days (12:45 - 12:50)
these events as time to spend with my (12:48 - 12:52)
friends and when i can't do that (12:50 - 12:56)
i just enjoy it less that's reasonable i (12:52 - 12:57)
think you can say that about any game (12:56 - 12:58)
though (12:57 - 12:59)
that's like pretty much anything like i (12:58 - 13:01)
haven't touched i haven't i haven't (12:59 - 13:03)
touched my magic cards (13:01 - 13:06)
since february because why (13:03 - 13:08)
so the the reason there's a makeup day (13:06 - 13:09)
is because there were issues (13:08 - 13:11)
specifically in uh (13:09 - 13:14)
the asia area where (13:11 - 13:16)
i guess the biomes weren't activating (13:14 - 13:17)
properly (13:16 - 13:20)
and then i there was the only issue i (13:17 - 13:22)
had throughout the two days was (13:20 - 13:24)
on i think my saturday was like flawless (13:22 - 13:26)
issue wise but on (13:24 - 13:29)
sunday there was like maybe 20 minutes (13:26 - 13:30)
where the game was just super (13:29 - 13:33)
sluggish and when i when i asked other (13:30 - 13:35)
people they were like oh yeah it's (13:33 - 13:36)
sluggish for me too because i was like i (13:35 - 13:37)
don't know if it's my internet i don't (13:36 - 13:39)
know if it's where i'm standing i don't (13:37 - 13:40)
know if it's (13:39 - 13:42)
my phone i was having remote i was (13:40 - 13:44)
having the remote raid lockup problem (13:42 - 13:47)
where i would be in a remote raid and (13:44 - 13:48)
then either everything (13:47 - 13:50)
of mine got knocked out and then it just (13:48 - 13:52)
froze and it wouldn't (13:50 - 13:54)
break into another team out you had to (13:52 - 13:55)
like force with the app and then reach (13:54 - 13:56)
yeah (13:55 - 13:58)
and then rejoin um i had that too i mean (13:56 - 14:00)
that sounds like (13:58 - 14:03)
traditional pokemon go (14:00 - 14:03)
a real experience um and i got some i (14:05 - 14:09)
got some of the thing where everything (14:08 - 14:11)
disappears off the screen for (14:09 - 14:13)
30 seconds and then suddenly (14:11 - 14:15)
everything's back i had that a couple of (14:13 - 14:17)
times i had a little bit of sluggishness (14:15 - 14:17)
right (14:17 - 14:19)
right at the beginning of the morning (14:17 - 14:21)
right when i got to the park it was real (14:19 - 14:24)
it was real like oh boy i hope this (14:21 - 14:25)
isn't my day today (14:24 - 14:28)
but they bit picked back up uh will (14:25 - 14:29)
didn't play but well there was a cool (14:28 - 14:31)
thing where um (14:29 - 14:33)
inside the app there was little meters (14:31 - 14:35)
that were filling uh so it'd be (14:33 - 14:38)
it would be like send a million gifts (14:35 - 14:40)
when it worked (14:38 - 14:42)
but when when you could you could see (14:40 - 14:44)
the meter fill and then (14:42 - 14:47)
when it did fill professor willow would (14:44 - 14:48)
pop up being like hey we're activating (14:47 - 14:50)
the next bonus which is like double (14:48 - 14:52)
stardust or double xp (14:50 - 14:53)
so that was like brand new to that event (14:52 - 14:55)
they didn't have that yeah well they (14:53 - 14:59)
kind of had that at um older go fest but (14:55 - 15:01)
they were on like monitors in the team (14:59 - 15:02)
lodges (15:01 - 15:04)
yeah they were able to incorporate it in (15:02 - 15:05)
the app which is cool (15:04 - 15:06)
i don't know how many people check that (15:05 - 15:08)
kind of stuff because there's a lot of (15:06 - 15:10)
players that are like (15:08 - 15:12)
fear of missing out so they're like i (15:10 - 15:14)
cannot stop moving because i need to get (15:12 - 15:16)
all the shinies in the world (15:14 - 15:19)
i did have the problem where i got into (15:16 - 15:20)
my (15:19 - 15:23)
friends list at 11 am it crashed (15:20 - 15:25)
and then i could not re-access my (15:23 - 15:26)
friends list (15:25 - 15:30)
until about 2 30. really (15:26 - 15:33)
yeah i mean i was locked i was locked (15:30 - 15:35)
out and i managed to get because i had (15:33 - 15:37)
that one where you had to make one new (15:35 - 15:38)
friend (15:37 - 15:40)
and i was like hey people send me your (15:38 - 15:42)
you know is that very all these people (15:40 - 15:44)
sent me friend requests they weren't (15:42 - 15:46)
really heartfelt (15:44 - 15:49)
oh no also fyi (15:46 - 15:51)
if if you're listening to the podcast (15:49 - 15:54)
and you follow me on twitter (15:51 - 15:56)
and you see me say hey here's my friend (15:54 - 15:58)
card i need i have space (15:56 - 16:03)
tell me who you are yeah (15:58 - 16:05)
none of your names match up and that's (16:03 - 16:07)
like it's like oh i sent it to you and (16:05 - 16:08)
i'm like you did because i now have (16:07 - 16:11)
i literally have 150 requests in my (16:08 - 16:12)
thing (16:11 - 16:15)
and if you did not reach out to me i am (16:12 - 16:16)
not clicking (16:15 - 16:18)
accept because i don't know who you are (16:16 - 16:19)
the switch problem where it's like you (16:18 - 16:20)
have (16:19 - 16:22)
four mics and they all have like bowser (16:20 - 16:24)
silhouettes and you're like well i don't (16:22 - 16:26)
know which bowser is the which bowser is (16:24 - 16:27)
the real mic (16:26 - 16:30)
it's like just tell me your name i keep (16:27 - 16:32)
mine consistent for a reason (16:30 - 16:35)
like just let me know and i will (16:32 - 16:36)
absolutely make sure that you're in my (16:35 - 16:37)
friends list (16:36 - 16:39)
i will not make sure that i'm sending (16:37 - 16:40)
you gifts because i don't play the game (16:39 - 16:42)
as much anymore (16:40 - 16:46)
and i'm working down the list so uh (16:42 - 16:48)
every day i do i send gifts every day (16:46 - 16:49)
but i'm working down (16:48 - 16:51)
my list so that i can build up the (16:49 - 16:52)
friendship so once i get to best friends (16:51 - 16:54)
i can keep moving down the list (16:52 - 16:55)
so if i haven't touched your thing in (16:54 - 16:58)
two years tell me what your name is and (16:55 - 16:59)
i'll move (16:58 - 17:02)
you up on the list but when you but it's (16:59 - 17:04)
like rudeboy40 i'm like (17:02 - 17:07)
literally most of my friends pretty much (17:04 - 17:08)
yeah (17:07 - 17:10)
my sister who this is just just a very (17:08 - 17:12)
casual example (17:10 - 17:15)
my sister was really addicted to pokemon (17:12 - 17:17)
go when it came out she was actually a (17:15 - 17:18)
higher level than me for (17:17 - 17:22)
quite a while oh burn um and then she (17:18 - 17:25)
she stopped playing around gen 2 when (17:22 - 17:26)
gen 2 dropped (17:25 - 17:30)
which was in the winter in wisconsin (17:26 - 17:32)
so there's a lot of reason not to play (17:30 - 17:34)
she texted me the morning of (17:32 - 17:35)
and she said are you playing pokemon (17:34 - 17:36)
today and i said yeah i'm playing (17:35 - 17:38)
downtown and then she (17:36 - 17:41)
proceeded not to say anything and then (17:38 - 17:42)
after the event (17:41 - 17:44)
uh on saturday i said i asked her if she (17:42 - 17:46)
bought a ticket cause that's what i (17:44 - 17:46)
assumed (17:46 - 17:49)
she was asking and she said uh yeah i (17:46 - 17:51)
got a ticket i'm kind of mad that they (17:49 - 17:52)
weren't giving away a legendary this (17:51 - 17:54)
year i already have charizard venusaur (17:52 - 17:56)
and blastoise (17:54 - 17:59)
um so i (17:56 - 18:01)
i told her that there that there's there (17:59 - 18:04)
are legendaries the second day because (18:01 - 18:06)
she this she doesn't even have twitter i (18:04 - 18:07)
don't even think she has a facebook like (18:06 - 18:09)
she she does no social media (18:07 - 18:12)
oh she's living the dream tell me how to (18:09 - 18:13)
get into her world (18:12 - 18:16)
she has uh three kids so her well (18:13 - 18:18)
you know she's not worried about all (18:16 - 18:20)
that kind of stuff so i'm sure i'm sure (18:18 - 18:20)
she (18:20 - 18:23)
purified her shadow mewtwo too uh (18:20 - 18:24)
because she didn't really (18:23 - 18:27)
don't she's the biggest mistake ever i (18:24 - 18:29)
read its heart she didn't read the silth (18:27 - 18:30)
road so anyways (18:29 - 18:32)
after after sunday i said how was your (18:30 - 18:34)
go fest and she said i got all my (18:32 - 18:35)
legendary smiley face and i said do you (18:34 - 18:36)
think it was worth (18:35 - 18:40)
15 and her response was (18:36 - 18:41)
day one i questioned it because i (18:40 - 18:43)
already have the beginning gen 1 (18:41 - 18:44)
evolution so i was like was that (18:43 - 18:46)
it you think if you're paying for (18:44 - 18:48)
something you'd get rare pokemon so you (18:46 - 18:50)
couldn't get without a ticket so yeah (18:48 - 18:51)
it ended up being worth it only because (18:50 - 18:53)
i didn't have those pokemon and without (18:51 - 18:55)
the fest i wouldn't be able to get them (18:53 - 18:56)
i enjoy playing the game more when they (18:55 - 18:59)
have those fun events and challenges (18:56 - 19:01)
and then i said there's a makeup day and (18:59 - 19:04)
she said oh it wasn't broken for me (19:01 - 19:07)
oh there you go well but i was like well (19:04 - 19:09)
you should probably do it (19:07 - 19:11)
i don't think she realizes that like (19:09 - 19:12)
gibbel is rare (19:11 - 19:14)
i don't think i think i think she is (19:12 - 19:16)
she's literally that person that like (19:14 - 19:18)
catches one pokemon and she's like i (19:16 - 19:20)
have it now i'm done (19:18 - 19:23)
well what what more do you need oh it's (19:20 - 19:23)
true (19:23 - 19:26)
it's true what more do you need yeah but (19:23 - 19:28)
yeah so saturday night she was bummed (19:26 - 19:29)
because she was like we're all the (19:28 - 19:30)
legendary pokemon and then on (19:29 - 19:33)
sunday she got four legendaries and a (19:30 - 19:34)
mythical (19:33 - 19:37)
so to hear it was worth it i think from (19:34 - 19:39)
what i saw the only complaints i saw (19:37 - 19:40)
were people that were like (19:39 - 19:42)
this was supposed to be shiny fest were (19:40 - 19:43)
all my shinies (19:42 - 19:45)
yeah i mean additionally that's what (19:43 - 19:47)
happens (19:45 - 19:49)
i mean i didn't get any so the silph (19:47 - 19:51)
road data mined and they said the odds (19:49 - 19:51)
were (19:51 - 19:53)
very much the same as it always has been (19:51 - 19:55)
for gofest (19:53 - 19:57)
i mean i went to go fest last year i got (19:55 - 19:59)
two shinies the entire (19:57 - 20:01)
eight hour 10 hours however much was i (19:59 - 20:02)
got 30 this time (20:01 - 20:07)
but over the course of two days and (20:02 - 20:10)
yeah that's rng (20:07 - 20:13)
yeah i didn't see i didn't i honestly (20:10 - 20:14)
didn't see a lot of people complaining (20:13 - 20:15)
that (20:14 - 20:18)
uh over that they didn't get (20:15 - 20:19)
shinies i saw a lot of people (20:18 - 20:21)
complaining about slowdowns (20:19 - 20:24)
about the raid lockups the having to (20:21 - 20:26)
quit the app to jump back in (20:24 - 20:28)
things that have happened at other (20:26 - 20:29)
go-fests (20:28 - 20:32)
that still haven't been fixed and i (20:29 - 20:33)
think that's a slightly legitimate (20:32 - 20:34)
complaint but yeah (20:33 - 20:36)
you know this is coming you know how (20:34 - 20:37)
many people are playing (20:36 - 20:39)
and it may not be something they can't (20:37 - 20:41)
fix it could just be everybody accesses (20:39 - 20:44)
at the same time but when i had (20:41 - 20:46)
like when i was in the height of the hey (20:44 - 20:48)
willow needs us to send gifts and i'm (20:46 - 20:51)
literally barred from my friends list (20:48 - 20:54)
for three hours i i can see the (20:51 - 20:56)
complaints like that was frustrating we (20:54 - 20:57)
still hit it (20:56 - 20:59)
but it was like i would love to send (20:57 - 21:00)
guests i would love to send a lot of (20:59 - 21:01)
gifts because i'm getting them (21:00 - 21:04)
but i literally cannot get into my (21:01 - 21:05)
friends list and i couldn't (21:04 - 21:07)
for three hours i wonder what like (21:05 - 21:08)
determines that (21:07 - 21:10)
it's account based or server based or (21:08 - 21:11)
yeah it could be (21:10 - 21:13)
like which virtual server you are (21:11 - 21:15)
attached to or something like that (21:13 - 21:17)
i saw some complaints of people saying (21:15 - 21:18)
like why even buy (21:17 - 21:21)
the ticket if the spawns were the same i (21:18 - 21:22)
don't know if those people actually know (21:21 - 21:24)
what they're talking about (21:22 - 21:26)
i don't know what that means because (21:24 - 21:28)
like people were upset that the (21:26 - 21:30)
the incense and the ticket were like (21:28 - 21:32)
really only giving you (21:30 - 21:33)
like unknown and like a few other (21:32 - 21:35)
pokemon oh (21:33 - 21:36)
so they were like well why buy the (21:35 - 21:38)
ticket if if non-players (21:36 - 21:42)
are or not non-paying people (21:38 - 21:45)
are getting the same spawns but (21:42 - 21:48)
to me i played so i didn't want to turn (21:45 - 21:49)
an incense on (21:48 - 21:51)
while i was setting so i didn't start (21:49 - 21:52)
the days until noon (21:51 - 21:56)
stream wise so my my plan you missed it (21:52 - 21:57)
i streamed from 12 to 8 (21:56 - 22:00)
both days so i was like well that's 18 (21:57 - 22:02)
hours i'm live i'm walking around the (22:00 - 22:02)
heat (22:02 - 22:05)
with the giant backpack on i don't i (22:02 - 22:07)
don't need to attack on an extra two (22:05 - 22:08)
hours both days (22:07 - 22:11)
like so while i was setting up (22:08 - 22:14)
from like 10 to 12 i didn't use an (22:11 - 22:15)
incense (22:14 - 22:18)
because i was like well i'm not like i'm (22:15 - 22:20)
setting up equipment i'm like packing a (22:18 - 22:20)
lunch (22:20 - 22:24)
i'm getting dressed i'm doing all that (22:20 - 22:26)
so but i'll have a pokeball plus and (22:24 - 22:27)
every time i walk back to the couch (22:26 - 22:29)
where my phone is sitting i'll check the (22:27 - 22:29)
spawns (22:29 - 22:31)
obviously i'll be driving as well so i (22:29 - 22:32)
don't want to have an incense on when (22:31 - 22:34)
i'm driving that's just wasting it so (22:32 - 22:35)
i'm just not going to pop an incense (22:34 - 22:37)
until i get to the park (22:35 - 22:40)
and it was so when so the event starts (22:37 - 22:41)
at ten (22:40 - 22:43)
and then it ends at eight and then (22:41 - 22:45)
obviously after eight it goes back to (22:43 - 22:47)
normal spawns for the rest of the night (22:45 - 22:49)
so i don't know what these people are (22:47 - 22:50)
talking about i don't know if like (22:49 - 22:51)
somebody was like (22:50 - 22:53)
with it somebody like was with a ticket (22:51 - 22:54)
was playing (22:53 - 22:55)
somebody with a non-ticket and the (22:54 - 22:57)
non-ticket person like unless you were (22:55 - 22:59)
looking at that person's phone (22:57 - 23:00)
the whole time or that non-ticket person (22:59 - 23:02)
was like yeah i also found a gimbal here (23:00 - 23:05)
but yeah for me it was a night and day (23:02 - 23:06)
different (23:05 - 23:08)
the spawns were like yeah without a (23:06 - 23:09)
without (23:08 - 23:11)
the incense yeah sure i found like a (23:09 - 23:13)
chimecho and a chancey and stuff in my (23:11 - 23:13)
house (23:13 - 23:15)
but as soon as i popped it on like the (23:13 - 23:17)
spawns were significantly better and (23:15 - 23:18)
more (23:17 - 23:21)
and and i don't know i i (23:18 - 23:23)
those complaints were weird to me i (23:21 - 23:25)
don't know if those were like (23:23 - 23:26)
specifically (23:25 - 23:28)
like tunnel vision complaints where they (23:26 - 23:29)
their friend just said they had good (23:28 - 23:31)
spawns or (23:29 - 23:33)
were considering chancey a good spawn i (23:31 - 23:35)
don't i'm not sure (23:33 - 23:37)
but when i turn on the incense from (23:35 - 23:39)
playing two hours with it (23:37 - 23:42)
as a ticket in my like it just it just (23:39 - 23:44)
seemed like the incense definitely (23:42 - 23:46)
gave you way way better stuff i don't (23:44 - 23:47)
know why you would play this event (23:46 - 23:49)
without it on (23:47 - 23:51)
i just think people who people who want (23:49 - 23:53)
to complain will find something to (23:51 - 23:55)
complain about (23:53 - 23:56)
whether it's completely divorced from (23:55 - 23:58)
reality or not there you go (23:56 - 24:00)
if that's if that's the most they had to (23:58 - 24:02)
complain about then what a successful (24:00 - 24:03)
event it was (24:02 - 24:05)
yeah i guess it was like the people (24:03 - 24:07)
looking for sort of joke complaints and (24:05 - 24:08)
they're like did you see the title (24:07 - 24:09)
screen (24:08 - 24:11)
it's like oh gosh where are we who cares (24:09 - 24:14)
about the title screen man (24:11 - 24:17)
this is what you're hanging your head on (24:14 - 24:18)
uh (24:17 - 24:19)
and then the the cool thing that i think (24:18 - 24:21)
a lot of people missed is niantic (24:19 - 24:23)
promise to donate (24:21 - 24:26)
at least five million dollars to charity (24:23 - 24:28)
after the event of go fest they have (24:26 - 24:30)
announced since then (24:28 - 24:32)
uh because they sold so many tickets (24:30 - 24:33)
that they're donating a minimum of (24:32 - 24:36)
10 million dollars to charity that's (24:33 - 24:37)
awesome (24:36 - 24:41)
i i think though there there's no doubt (24:37 - 24:42)
well there's no doubt because i saw (24:41 - 24:44)
people that worked at niantic tweet (24:42 - 24:45)
about they're very excited for go fest (24:44 - 24:46)
next year so i (24:45 - 24:48)
there's no doubt that there's going to (24:46 - 24:50)
be a go fest next year (24:48 - 24:52)
but i i think they're i think they (24:50 - 24:53)
cannot do an (24:52 - 24:56)
irl go fest without offering a digital (24:53 - 24:58)
go vest to people who can't travel (24:56 - 25:00)
what makes you think that why would they (24:58 - 25:02)
walk away from all that money (25:00 - 25:05)
well there is that you are right (25:02 - 25:08)
if they can if they can still do a a (25:05 - 25:09)
physical go fest (25:08 - 25:11)
which i i think they probably still want (25:09 - 25:12)
to do that (25:11 - 25:15)
um and then charge you know whatever 25 (25:12 - 25:16)
for the day (25:15 - 25:17)
gosh how would they even do that so if (25:16 - 25:20)
they're charging 15 for two days they (25:17 - 25:21)
were charging 25 (25:20 - 25:23)
for a day if they're doing like go fest (25:21 - 25:25)
is three days friday saturday sunday (25:23 - 25:29)
do you buy a 25 (25:25 - 25:31)
ticket for your one day and then do you (25:29 - 25:33)
get the digital ticket for the other two (25:31 - 25:34)
days do you buy a digital (25:33 - 25:36)
ticket separately yeah i think you're (25:34 - 25:38)
way overthinking these things (25:36 - 25:40)
that like i i think the closest (25:38 - 25:42)
comparison you can think of as like a (25:40 - 25:42)
live (25:42 - 25:45)
performance concert by a large name (25:42 - 25:46)
musical artist (25:45 - 25:50)
and it's like yeah that could be live (25:46 - 25:51)
streamed (25:50 - 25:53)
so you charge like thirty dollars thirty (25:51 - 25:54)
dollars what (25:53 - 25:58)
fantasy world am i living yeah (25:54 - 25:58)
to be able to watch it on stream so you (25:59 - 26:02)
miss out on all the (26:01 - 26:05)
body odor and other (26:02 - 26:08)
dis inconveniences of being there quote (26:05 - 26:09)
unquote live (26:08 - 26:12)
500 miles from the stage yeah well the (26:09 - 26:14)
last three go fast they do (26:12 - 26:16)
they do like what was it the first go (26:14 - 26:17)
fest it was like plussel and mine in (26:16 - 26:18)
right (26:17 - 26:20)
maybe that was that the first one was (26:18 - 26:22)
the second one yeah and then the second (26:20 - 26:24)
the third one was like they made horsey (26:22 - 26:25)
spawn everywhere (26:24 - 26:28)
and then dwarf month they made dorth (26:25 - 26:30)
month i think was rosalia (26:28 - 26:32)
and then there was the taiwan event (26:30 - 26:33)
where they made (26:32 - 26:36)
wingle spawn everywhere they do kind of (26:33 - 26:37)
acknowledge it but (26:36 - 26:39)
they they've kind of clearly proven that (26:37 - 26:41)
people are willing to pay fifteen (26:39 - 26:42)
dollars for a digital event (26:41 - 26:43)
i guess they proved that too with like (26:42 - 26:45)
the genesect and the the the richie (26:43 - 26:46)
gigas event where they were like eight (26:45 - 26:47)
bucks (26:46 - 26:49)
but those were one day events this was a (26:47 - 26:51)
two day event so i think 15 (26:49 - 26:53)
is probably fair even if you didn't walk (26:51 - 26:54)
away with like chinese or stuff i mean (26:53 - 26:55)
like (26:54 - 26:58)
you did get what like 14 (26:55 - 27:01)
incense and a lot lucky eggs and start (26:58 - 27:03)
us like you you get the items back at (27:01 - 27:04)
least (27:03 - 27:06)
i would assume if they're going to do go (27:04 - 27:08)
fest again that they're going to offer (27:06 - 27:10)
a play-at-home experience play at home (27:08 - 27:13)
experience for however yeah (27:10 - 27:14)
and then if people don't want to play at (27:13 - 27:16)
home they'll still get their (27:14 - 27:18)
whatever horsey or their wing goal or (27:16 - 27:19)
whatever is the pokemon featured (27:18 - 27:21)
spawning more in the wild (27:19 - 27:24)
i would just say it's like the the only (27:21 - 27:26)
reason that they wouldn't offer a play (27:24 - 27:27)
at home experience is if they really (27:26 - 27:28)
want to make (27:27 - 27:32)
the actual in-person go fest a premium (27:28 - 27:35)
like i was there experience well they (27:32 - 27:35)
can (27:35 - 27:38)
right they can they can go like because (27:35 - 27:39)
they don't need the money (27:38 - 27:42)
they do they do not need the money right (27:39 - 27:43)
so (27:42 - 27:45)
plenty of money from that transaction (27:43 - 27:46)
though (27:45 - 27:48)
i i agree with you will of like they (27:46 - 27:49)
need to make like a premium experience (27:48 - 27:51)
if they're offering a play at home and (27:49 - 27:51)
uh (27:51 - 27:54)
travel to chicago to do this i don't (27:51 - 27:56)
know what that (27:54 - 27:59)
is though i i have a feeling like (27:56 - 28:01)
it would be more interesting if they had (27:59 - 28:03)
the premium content on one days and then (28:01 - 28:04)
the play at home (28:03 - 28:08)
as out the weekend after to stop (28:04 - 28:10)
the overload of the servers right (28:08 - 28:11)
because i think (28:10 - 28:13)
if they have them at the same time (28:11 - 28:14)
people at the park are going to be super (28:13 - 28:15)
frustrated that slow (28:14 - 28:16)
yeah people at home are going to be (28:15 - 28:18)
super frustrated that it's slow (28:16 - 28:21)
so it may be a thing like you can access (28:18 - 28:23)
and get all these things (28:21 - 28:26)
the week before and then you'll get a (28:23 - 28:26)
lesser (28:26 - 28:28)
version of it at home the weekend after (28:26 - 28:30)
yeah i mean that already exists though i (28:28 - 28:30)
mean (28:30 - 28:33)
people at go fest gets victini now and (28:30 - 28:34)
then eventually everyone will get (28:33 - 28:36)
victini (28:34 - 28:38)
later yeah but i'm talking about like a (28:36 - 28:39)
year and a half later (28:38 - 28:43)
i'm talking like a week later sure (28:39 - 28:44)
because i'm trying to think back at the (28:43 - 28:46)
ghost like i'm trying to think back on (28:44 - 28:46)
our alaska (28:46 - 28:49)
fest and like i think about the like the (28:46 - 28:52)
walking between biomes is really cool (28:49 - 28:54)
i wouldn't consider that a premium (28:52 - 28:56)
experience i would just consider that (28:54 - 28:58)
you needed to decorate this park to make (28:56 - 29:00)
you feel like their money is good (28:58 - 29:01)
no no no no that was a premium (29:00 - 29:03)
experience i got to walk in (29:01 - 29:06)
snow in the middle of july but also the (29:03 - 29:07)
quests were (29:06 - 29:09)
set to do that right like that (29:07 - 29:11)
experience of wandering that park (29:09 - 29:13)
was tied to the quest that day yeah that (29:11 - 29:16)
was the experience that you can't get (29:13 - 29:18)
remotely yeah that was super fun being (29:16 - 29:19)
able to be like oh we have to run back (29:18 - 29:20)
to the ghost (29:19 - 29:22)
haunted forest because i need to do (29:20 - 29:23)
these things or (29:22 - 29:25)
what what was it like they had the (29:23 - 29:27)
battle air horsey is trapped in the (29:25 - 29:30)
desert and now i have to walk it back to (29:27 - 29:32)
the water area like those things were (29:30 - 29:34)
super fun i think that's part of that (29:32 - 29:35)
premium experience (29:34 - 29:38)
fairy garden heck yeah yeah and of (29:35 - 29:39)
course (29:38 - 29:41)
i like that fairy garden food trucks the (29:39 - 29:42)
premium jobs (29:41 - 29:44)
count for the the trading booth (29:42 - 29:47)
surrounded by hay barrels but next to (29:44 - 29:48)
the rib (29:47 - 29:51)
food truck it just smells like (29:48 - 29:54)
yes regret i guess yes that was (29:51 - 29:56)
awesome part of it it was like like that (29:54 - 29:58)
whole trading area was also in direct (29:56 - 30:00)
sunlight so you're like (29:58 - 30:02)
trying to trade for a mess sprit and (30:00 - 30:04)
it's like super hot and all you can (30:02 - 30:04)
smell is (30:04 - 30:07)
ribs and hay and you're like oh is this (30:04 - 30:09)
really premium (30:07 - 30:11)
i wanna don't don't forget like the (30:09 - 30:12)
little contest that they ran and they (30:11 - 30:13)
had medals and everything (30:12 - 30:15)
don't get me started you have the (30:13 - 30:17)
furthest trade and a bunch of (30:15 - 30:21)
scams oh you are just such a negative (30:17 - 30:23)
nelly okay one in the contest the dude (30:21 - 30:25)
was sitting there with a lunch tray and (30:23 - 30:26)
three (30:25 - 30:27)
phones and the guy was like who has the (30:26 - 30:29)
most magic car for the dude like let me (30:27 - 30:31)
check my three different phones here (30:29 - 30:34)
oh this phone does but (30:31 - 30:37)
still that was yeah exciting just (30:34 - 30:41)
i mean that's pokemon go in a nutshell (30:37 - 30:43)
right there the dude with seven phones (30:41 - 30:43)
you know (30:43 - 30:45)
it's just a lunch tray it was a (30:43 - 30:47)
legitimate lunch tray like (30:45 - 30:50)
it was we can't everybody can't be on (30:47 - 30:51)
the same level but i think it was still (30:50 - 30:52)
a fun idea (30:51 - 30:54)
to have the contest and assume that (30:52 - 30:56)
everybody out there is honest (30:54 - 31:00)
i mean if i i would travel to a gofest (30:56 - 31:01)
i don't think i want to go to chicago (31:00 - 31:03)
again (31:01 - 31:03)
so i've been to chicago this year so (31:04 - 31:07)
i've used up my (31:05 - 31:09)
chicago time for the year so at least i (31:07 - 31:12)
won't have to go again until 2021 but i (31:09 - 31:12)
would (31:12 - 31:14)
really prefer that it was in like lovely (31:12 - 31:16)
st louis under the arch (31:14 - 31:17)
i don't think you could service under (31:16 - 31:22)
the arch she had service under the arch (31:17 - 31:22)
has like mobile equipment built in (31:23 - 31:27)
definitely don't get serviced near that (31:25 - 31:29)
bean in chicago (31:27 - 31:32)
let me tell you i got plenty of service (31:29 - 31:33)
by that bean (31:32 - 31:36)
right now you cannot get within 40 feet (31:33 - 31:37)
of the cloud gate (31:36 - 31:40)
so that was real just the cleanest that (31:37 - 31:41)
beat has ever been (31:40 - 31:43)
you got that right something else most (31:41 - 31:45)
things have ever been okay (31:43 - 31:47)
so so i think the most humorous and (31:45 - 31:48)
saddest experience (31:47 - 31:50)
was somebody got engaged i was walking (31:48 - 31:52)
by and somebody got engaged (31:50 - 31:55)
next to the cloud gate except 40 feet (31:52 - 31:56)
from the clock (31:55 - 31:58)
because there's fences all around it and (31:56 - 32:01)
you can't get near it why did you just (31:58 - 32:01)
not (32:01 - 32:05)
wait i know no waiting (32:01 - 32:09)
we are in the end times waiting (32:05 - 32:09)
now we're gonna find out they listen to (32:09 - 32:13)
the show oh i hope so i mean (32:10 - 32:16)
congratulations (32:13 - 32:16)
she was very excited i was very happy (32:17 - 32:20)
for her i mean i was (32:19 - 32:22)
30 feet away from her keeping a very (32:20 - 32:24)
adequate social distance and i could (32:22 - 32:25)
hear her scream (32:24 - 32:29)
how happy she was to be engaged (32:25 - 32:33)
yes and actually in uh in millennium (32:29 - 32:34)
park you they have people walking around (32:33 - 32:36)
you have to wear a mask even while (32:34 - 32:38)
you're outside in millennium park (32:36 - 32:40)
well i mean that park is like pretty (32:38 - 32:42)
crowded though no (32:40 - 32:44)
no that's not when the bean is closed (32:42 - 32:46)
well maybe yeah anytime i'm at the park (32:44 - 32:47)
it's (32:46 - 32:48)
like you're consistently walking past (32:47 - 32:50)
other people there's no way to avoid it (32:48 - 32:52)
before we take a break all the all the (32:50 - 32:54)
unlocks happened here so (32:52 - 32:57)
uh scraggy is in the august research (32:54 - 32:58)
breakthrough (32:57 - 33:01)
so scraggy was originally exclusive to (32:58 - 33:02)
go battle league for (33:01 - 33:05)
for uh a period of time (33:02 - 33:06)
now you can get you know you can get in (33:05 - 33:08)
research i'm (33:06 - 33:11)
sure people are complaining for the the (33:08 - 33:12)
10th month in a row that they're still (33:11 - 33:14)
not legendaries i don't think they've (33:12 - 33:15)
gotten the hint yet (33:14 - 33:18)
uh dragon week is going on right now so (33:15 - 33:18)
uh (33:18 - 33:21)
gibble to alolan exeggutor rayquaza is (33:18 - 33:22)
back (33:21 - 33:25)
timed research will get you at least two (33:22 - 33:27)
guaranteed dinos (33:25 - 33:31)
i i i just yes (33:27 - 33:32)
i don't know why i read the internet (33:31 - 33:34)
anymore people again complaining about (33:32 - 33:36)
this event and how it's disappointing (33:34 - 33:37)
how there's not enough dragon (33:36 - 33:39)
i don't know i'm seeing dratini (33:37 - 33:41)
everywhere i never see dratini (33:39 - 33:43)
i personally know i know trap pinch is (33:41 - 33:45)
really common in ground biomes (33:43 - 33:47)
i don't see trap pinch in my biome but (33:45 - 33:48)
i'm seeing a bunch of trap pinch now (33:47 - 33:51)
the actual one hour walk i went on to (33:48 - 33:55)
play go not from my house i found gibbel (33:51 - 33:57)
uh i'm i like seeing alolan exeggutor in (33:55 - 33:58)
the wild (33:57 - 33:59)
because i haven't gotten a shiny one of (33:58 - 34:01)
those so it's always fun to see those (33:59 - 34:04)
i don't know i i think it's fine i i (34:01 - 34:06)
feel like people have this expectation (34:04 - 34:06)
where they (34:06 - 34:09)
read stuff like uh dragon week gimple (34:06 - 34:11)
dino and then they get mad that there's (34:09 - 34:12)
just not non-spot (34:11 - 34:16)
non-stop gimbal in their house like (34:12 - 34:17)
like did you think that was gonna happen (34:16 - 34:20)
i don't i mean also (34:17 - 34:22)
are these the same people complaining (34:20 - 34:23)
that there's not kibble in the wild (34:22 - 34:26)
or did they were did none of these (34:23 - 34:27)
people go to go fest where like they (34:26 - 34:29)
gave you an hour of non-stop gibble (34:27 - 34:30)
during the battle (34:29 - 34:33)
part of it like i probably was happy (34:30 - 34:35)
well you were busy but (34:33 - 34:37)
you're also not a hardcore player that (34:35 - 34:38)
is (34:37 - 34:40)
going to the internet to complain about (34:38 - 34:42)
these events this is true (34:40 - 34:45)
this is true people like dratini it (34:42 - 34:47)
almost won a community day (34:45 - 34:48)
people want shiny dratini not everyone (34:47 - 34:50)
was playing this game four years ago (34:48 - 34:52)

rolla rock and roller i feel like (37:45 - 37:50)
is i don't think it has it existed in (37:47 - 37:52)
the wild or was it right only (37:50 - 37:54)
it's existed in the wild i'm pretty sure (37:52 - 37:55)
i think i've oh my god i think so (37:54 - 37:58)
free from reds or maybe like eggs oh (37:55 - 38:00)
yeah i think it was an eggs (37:58 - 38:02)
uh fyi birth island is the island you're (38:00 - 38:05)
thinking of it was an emerald fire red (38:02 - 38:05)
and leaf green (38:05 - 38:08)
okay but it was a triangle yeah it's a (38:05 - 38:09)
triangle okay (38:08 - 38:10)
it was like i'm pretty sure it was a (38:09 - 38:13)
triangle it's a triangle yes (38:10 - 38:16)
it is defo triangle buffalon being in (38:13 - 38:18)
new york city (38:16 - 38:19)
we're gonna we're gonna road trip yeah (38:18 - 38:21)
i'll pick you up on the way not new york (38:19 - 38:22)
state just the city (38:21 - 38:25)
that's cool i got friends in manhattan (38:22 - 38:27)
look i'll eventually get out to new york (38:25 - 38:29)
so many people go in and go out you know (38:27 - 38:31)
how many layovers i've had in new york (38:29 - 38:33)
it'll be fine i'll find one i'm in no (38:31 - 38:35)
rush which is fun because (38:33 - 38:38)
i neither new york airport is in (38:35 - 38:39)
manhattan (38:38 - 38:41)
so neither one is it is it because of (38:39 - 38:43)
wall street that it's (38:41 - 38:46)
only in manhattan i hmm (38:43 - 38:49)
interesting concept i mean is that why (38:46 - 38:50)
because of bull markets like i can't (38:49 - 38:51)
think of (38:50 - 38:53)
like oh the wild prairie isn't in (38:51 - 38:54)
manhattan (38:53 - 38:56)
well look buffalo's they could have they (38:54 - 38:58)
could have put it in like (38:56 - 39:00)
wyoming or north dakota but niantic (38:58 - 39:02)
knows that no one plays there and no one (39:00 - 39:04)
travels there so it would have been (39:02 - 39:06)
no one exists there the rarest pokemon (39:04 - 39:07)
ever attitude (39:06 - 39:11)
so you put it you put it in like (39:07 - 39:13)
one of the two cities that have the most (39:11 - 39:15)
people move in and out (39:13 - 39:18)
it'll be fine man i wish they'd put it (39:15 - 39:20)
in north dakota that's only like four (39:18 - 39:20)
hours away (39:20 - 39:24)
as far as i know yeah i mean (39:20 - 39:26)
four hours is about 50 years in the past (39:24 - 39:28)
but you put in the city where like (39:26 - 39:29)
millions of people (39:28 - 39:31)
go in and go out a day or do you put it (39:29 - 39:33)
in a state of wyoming where (39:31 - 39:36)
four people a year leave and come (39:33 - 39:38)
i mean you could put it anywhere because (39:36 - 39:40)
nobody's going in and out of (39:38 - 39:43)
anything right now uh that's true i mean (39:40 - 39:44)
i don't know if there's anyone that (39:43 - 39:46)
loves boofland enough to be like oh we (39:44 - 39:49)
gotta hit up new york right now (39:46 - 39:53)
you look i have 200 plus bouffalon and (39:49 - 39:55)
sordid shield i don't (39:53 - 39:58)
i don't need one in pokemon go it's not (39:55 - 40:00)
going anywhere do any of them have the (39:58 - 40:01)
rare mark (40:00 - 40:04)
ah they do i have one with the rare mark (40:01 - 40:05)
is it shiny nah (40:04 - 40:08)
then you failed i don't think i got a (40:05 - 40:10)
sculloped with a rare mark though (40:08 - 40:13)
ooh trade it to me (40:10 - 40:13)
baby (40:13 - 40:16)
this is definitely will's last episode (40:16 - 40:21)
after that wow i've already got my shiny (40:19 - 40:23)
ventipede i don't need no (40:21 - 40:26)
rare markers (40:23 - 40:28)
all right those are those are the events (40:26 - 40:29)
what is not (40:28 - 40:32)
shiny oh diago palkia i'm assuming (40:29 - 40:33)
they're going to turn d'algon pakistani (40:32 - 40:35)
this summer because they did that with (40:33 - 40:37)
rayquaza they held on to it (40:35 - 40:38)
and then they made a boatload of money (40:37 - 40:40)
when they turned to chinese (40:38 - 40:41)
so i'm sure they're gonna do that (40:40 - 40:44)
anyways it was nice to see them through (40:41 - 40:45)
go fest and it was nice to see kyogre (40:44 - 40:47)
and groudon through go fest too (40:45 - 40:49)
yep i did a lot of those raids never (40:47 - 40:51)
shiny i heard you didn't get a lot of (40:49 - 40:52)
shinies (40:51 - 40:55)
i got zero perfect thank you (40:52 - 40:58)
thank you for asking thank you for (40:55 - 40:59)
sharing (40:58 - 41:02)
my pain with the world i'll let niantic (40:59 - 41:03)
know (41:02 - 41:06)
please do i mean it worked with dna so (41:03 - 41:09)
yeah uh speaking of dna let's take a (41:06 - 41:10)
break (41:09 - 41:13)
and then we get back there is a bunch of (41:10 - 41:14)
master stuff (41:13 - 41:16)
uh oh and there's champions path we (41:14 - 41:18)
gotta talk about champions path (41:16 - 41:19)
i mean do we have to talk about (41:18 - 41:21)
champions oh we gotta talk about (41:19 - 41:22)
champion's path (41:21 - 41:24)
i have a shiny lucky oddish that has (41:22 - 41:25)
nothing to do with (41:24 - 41:28)
champions (41:25 - 41:28)
that's right that's why i said it all (41:30 - 41:34)
right we'll be right back (41:32 - 41:38)
irene and i bought little flutes like (41:34 - 41:39)
musical flutes (41:38 - 41:50)
right instruments (41:39 - 41:50)
musical flutes (41:58 - 42:04)
irene and i bought little tubes (42:16 - 42:20)
and we're back even knee (42:22 - 42:27)
actually before we get to champions (42:25 - 42:29)
league years it's falling apart (42:27 - 42:32)
to celebrate 10 years uh we have (42:29 - 42:35)
launched a kickstarter (42:32 - 42:38)
with what people have been asking for (42:35 - 42:38)
which is (42:38 - 42:40)
for whatever reason i don't know why you (42:38 - 42:41)
guys are asking for this but people (42:40 - 42:43)
wanted a (42:41 - 42:46)
album of all the break music (42:43 - 42:48)
so that is that is what nick and i are (42:46 - 42:50)
doing you don't know why (42:48 - 42:52)
i do so they can listen to the good part (42:50 - 42:54)
of the show without having to listen to (42:52 - 42:54)
us (42:54 - 42:58)
oh that's so true i'm glad that you (42:54 - 42:59)
brought this up so let me know when it's (42:58 - 43:01)
time for me to make my commentary (42:59 - 43:04)
it's now i give you a permission now i (43:01 - 43:05)
steve's got to finish his (43:04 - 43:07)
spiel about where people can get to the (43:05 - 43:09)
kickstarter scam starter (43:07 - 43:13)
kicks kickstarter uh we'll go until the (43:09 - 43:14)
end of the month (43:13 - 43:17)
uh i've apparently some people haven't (43:14 - 43:18)
used kickstarter uh (43:17 - 43:20)
so just a heads up it does not charge (43:18 - 43:22)
you until the end of the month (43:20 - 43:25)
um so if you do pledge on whatever (43:22 - 43:28)
whatever tier you want to pledge on it (43:25 - 43:29)
doesn't charge you until the kickstarter (43:28 - 43:30)
is complete kickstarter is all or (43:29 - 43:31)
nothing (43:30 - 43:33)
so if you didn't don't hit your goal (43:31 - 43:35)
then it takes no money (43:33 - 43:38)
um it is not the scam that is indiegogo (43:35 - 43:42)
oh man we we've actually (43:38 - 43:43)
before we did patreon we had a (43:42 - 43:45)
kickstarter for the actual show (43:43 - 43:48)
um which was nice but this is (43:45 - 43:49)
specifically for the project so the (43:48 - 43:50)
kickstarter (43:49 - 43:54)
is going to pay for pretty much nick's (43:50 - 43:54)
time (43:54 - 43:57)
uh the podcast isn't probably seeing any (43:54 - 43:59)
of this money (43:57 - 44:01)
we gotta pay the government we gotta pay (43:59 - 44:02)
uh (44:01 - 44:04)
kickstarter because they charge fees and (44:02 - 44:06)
then the rest of the money will go to (44:04 - 44:08)
next time of going nick so nick is (44:06 - 44:10)
spending time going over all the songs (44:08 - 44:11)
again (44:10 - 44:14)
make sure that they're cleaned up add a (44:11 - 44:14)
little bit (44:14 - 44:16)
remix a little bit obviously he's been (44:14 - 44:18)
doing the music for three years so (44:16 - 44:21)
a song like uh abundance (44:18 - 44:23)
from three years ago he's learned some (44:21 - 44:26)
better techniques and how to (44:23 - 44:28)
edit music and then we're sending the (44:26 - 44:30)
music off to get mastered (44:28 - 44:33)
i i i'm not gonna sit here and explain (44:30 - 44:33)
what i (44:33 - 44:36)
i know what i'm that means i can just (44:33 - 44:38)
tell you that there's a (44:36 - 44:41)
non-mastered and a mastered version of (44:38 - 44:43)
one of the songs on the kickstarter page (44:41 - 44:45)
that you can listen to (44:43 - 44:47)
and the mastered one just sounds way (44:45 - 44:48)
better and i'm not sure (44:47 - 44:52)
what magic that is but we uh there are (44:48 - 44:56)
50 there's there are over 60 songs (44:52 - 44:59)
um and so we thought and no one's ever (44:56 - 45:01)
done this before but we thought it would (44:59 - 45:02)
be cool to offer (45:01 - 45:05)
two different albums and then each album (45:02 - 45:06)
would have (45:05 - 45:10)
the same songs but each album would also (45:06 - 45:12)
have like five exclusive songs (45:10 - 45:13)
now i don't think anyone has ever done (45:12 - 45:15)
this before but if you want to collect (45:13 - 45:16)
all the songs (45:15 - 45:19)
you'd have to buy both albums but just (45:16 - 45:21)
keep in mind that (45:19 - 45:25)
over 90 of the songs are the same (45:21 - 45:25)
so there are digital albums of course (45:28 - 45:32)
because we live in 2020 but because we (45:31 - 45:34)
also live in 2020 we're putting out two (45:32 - 45:37)
cds (45:34 - 45:40)
and and because we live in 2020 we're (45:37 - 45:42)
also putting out a third version (45:40 - 45:43)
again no company has ever done this (45:42 - 45:45)
before but some of us like to wait for (45:43 - 45:46)
the third version (45:45 - 45:49)
if that is the third version but we're (45:46 - 45:50)
gonna we're putting out the third (45:49 - 45:52)
version on cassette (45:50 - 45:55)
audio cassette audio an actual working (45:52 - 45:58)
cassette it will work if the (45:55 - 46:02)
i should hope so two people listening (45:58 - 46:04)
with cassette players one probably being (46:02 - 46:05)
will (46:04 - 46:07)
i ain't got no cassette player i have (46:05 - 46:08)
like a set (46:07 - 46:11)
player rude last time i had a cassette (46:08 - 46:13)
player it was in my hyundai tiburon (46:11 - 46:15)
which i haven't had since 2009. i mean i (46:13 - 46:16)
don't have a guess that player or my car (46:15 - 46:19)
i'm not ancient (46:16 - 46:19)
um so so that's that's what we're doing (46:21 - 46:27)
like uh i don't i don't think cassette (46:24 - 46:28)
will have any exclusive songs so nothing (46:27 - 46:30)
nothing to worry about there (46:28 - 46:33)
but the main reason we're doing the cds (46:30 - 46:33)
one (46:33 - 46:35)
besides it's funny to put out a cd in (46:33 - 46:36)
2020 but (46:35 - 46:40)
two is because the the the cds have art (46:36 - 46:41)
booklets (46:40 - 46:43)
and so we the some of the money from the (46:41 - 46:45)
kickstarter will also go to paying (46:43 - 46:49)
the artist to do the art for the book (46:45 - 46:51)
um and the different cds will have (46:49 - 46:52)
different art (46:51 - 46:55)
so you're getting some value there (46:52 - 46:57)
but if you if you want to get the music (46:55 - 46:58)
you got all month (46:57 - 47:00)
i'll probably remind you for the next (46:58 - 47:02)
couple weeks but (47:00 - 47:05)
uh you just have to (47:02 - 47:07)
look on twitter or look in the show (47:05 - 47:09)
notes uh for the kickstarter link or (47:07 - 47:10)
just go to kickstarter (47:09 - 47:13)
and type in super effective it'll pop up (47:10 - 47:14)
um but that's it (47:13 - 47:16)
that'll that'll be yeah we'll be posting (47:14 - 47:17)
updates i (47:16 - 47:20)
wish that was it now it's will time okay (47:17 - 47:21)
let's talk about the law (47:20 - 47:24)
a little bit which i i know a tiny (47:21 - 47:25)
little bit (47:24 - 47:27)
just enough to be dangerous here as i've (47:25 - 47:29)
studied the music industry (47:27 - 47:32)
i'm i love music would love to work in (47:29 - 47:33)
the music industry did a little study (47:32 - 47:34)
there (47:33 - 47:39)
there are three rights that artists (47:34 - 47:42)
have when it comes to music etc (47:39 - 47:45)
one publication right so the actual (47:42 - 47:46)
right to reproduce (47:45 - 47:49)
written songs you know paper so whatever (47:46 - 47:51)
people can publish them and then other (47:49 - 47:52)
people can read them (47:51 - 47:54)
another one is like broadcast rights (47:52 - 47:56)
right radio stations pay into a general (47:54 - 47:58)
fund so that the artists get a little (47:56 - 48:00)
bit of money every time that song is (47:58 - 48:03)
played and then there's (48:00 - 48:06)
the like recording reproduction right i (48:03 - 48:08)
believe my voice is on quite a few of (48:06 - 48:11)
these tracks (48:08 - 48:13)
will andrea will anderson need a little (48:11 - 48:15)
slice of that pie (48:13 - 48:15)
all right are you going to be talking to (48:17 - 48:20)
my lawyer (48:19 - 48:23)
i understand my my lawyer mr (48:20 - 48:28)

on facebook i could i could i could (48:41 - 48:45)
scratch records like dead mouse (48:43 - 48:49)
yep uh (48:45 - 48:50)
my two cents for those of you at the (48:49 - 48:52)
super top tier which is sold out (48:50 - 48:54)
uh go ahead and tweet at me anything (48:52 - 48:56)

and i'll try to make that happen i'll (48:57 - 49:01)
wedge your i'll wedge (48:59 - 49:04)
that into the show right before we sue (49:01 - 49:04)
steve (49:04 - 49:06)

stuff i just didn't want to make the (49:19 - 49:23)
as somebody who's play apparently i (49:21 - 49:26)
pledged over 100 kickstarters in my life (49:23 - 49:28)
that's it all of them for bike products (49:26 - 49:29)
and you don't even own a bike (49:28 - 49:32)
most of them almost all of them probably (49:29 - 49:34)
hot garbage actually (49:32 - 49:36)
i have a super board game super backer i (49:34 - 49:38)
just looked at how many (49:36 - 49:39)
projects i've backed how many have you (49:38 - 49:41)
backed uh (49:39 - 49:43)
okay both of you get one guess i'm going (49:41 - 49:44)

the showcase showdown i'll be taking my (49:59 - 50:02)
new car (50:01 - 50:05)
and my master's degree in lawyering and (50:02 - 50:06)
your brand (50:05 - 50:08)
new washer can you guys guess how many (50:06 - 50:10)
things i have kickstarted (50:08 - 50:13)
two no no more than two i'm gonna say (50:10 - 50:14)
eight (50:13 - 50:17)
i wanna say five uh well steve is (50:14 - 50:19)
closest cause it was nine (50:17 - 50:23)
oh tank ah dang how did i pledge 250 (50:19 - 50:25)
for battle city a pokemon inspired art (50:23 - 50:28)
show i didn't even get to go to that (50:25 - 50:32)
you know you win some you lose some i do (50:28 - 50:36)
lose something big time lose some did i (50:32 - 50:37)
back that way back (50:36 - 50:40)
it's hard to go back oh look okay here's (50:37 - 50:42)
the real question how many (50:40 - 50:46)
projects have i backed that were (50:42 - 50:49)
unsuccessful um i feel like you (50:46 - 50:51)
know when a project's gonna be (50:49 - 50:53)
unsuccessful when you like look at (50:51 - 50:55)
when it's like oh this project's been up (50:53 - 50:57)
for 20 days and they're not even halfway (50:55 - 50:59)
there (50:57 - 51:01)
i feel like you just know i think i've (50:59 - 51:02)
only backed like (51:01 - 51:04)
three unsuccessful that but they all (51:02 - 51:06)
like canceled they all like canceled (51:04 - 51:08)
before it even (51:06 - 51:10)
finished because they knew it wasn't (51:08 - 51:12)
going to work (51:10 - 51:16)
any guesses when i say five i'd say 37 (51:12 - 51:20)
six yeah two were cancelled four were (51:16 - 51:21)
unsuccessful (51:20 - 51:23)
yeah most people cancel before it gets (51:21 - 51:25)
to that yeah (51:23 - 51:29)
which is weird like because that last 48 (51:25 - 51:31)
hours is often such a huge push (51:29 - 51:32)
like some of you probably could have (51:31 - 51:35)
made it yeah (51:32 - 51:37)
the problem we had with the music one (51:35 - 51:38)
and (51:37 - 51:40)
this was one of the so do you do you (51:38 - 51:41)
guys remember when (51:40 - 51:45)
uh i went to pax except i went the wrong (51:41 - 51:46)
month (51:45 - 51:49)
yeah yeah i can't remember that (51:46 - 51:53)
i was there you were at pax (51:49 - 51:55)
i was not during the right month yes (51:53 - 51:56)
correct you were there (51:55 - 51:59)
you were there on time i was there (51:56 - 52:02)
exactly 30 days later (51:59 - 52:04)
uh but that was two years ago and that's (52:02 - 52:05)
when nick and i (52:04 - 52:08)
um so nick is who i usually stay with (52:05 - 52:12)
does all the music he's in boston boston (52:08 - 52:14)
and uh that's when we were talking about (52:12 - 52:16)
the album because at that point people (52:14 - 52:18)
already wanted them wanted some way to (52:16 - 52:19)
listen to the music (52:18 - 52:22)
but we also talked about vinyls (52:19 - 52:25)
and that was one of the things that's (52:22 - 52:28)
what ultimately led to cassettes because (52:25 - 52:32)
because cassettes are (52:28 - 52:35)
more expensive i think per cassette (52:32 - 52:37)
but there's no upfront costs on a (52:35 - 52:40)
cassette you just have to have a minimum (52:37 - 52:43)
so for cassettes you need i think a 50 (52:40 - 52:44)
order minimum (52:43 - 52:46)
um so that's why the cassettes are at a (52:44 - 52:49)
little bit of a higher tier just because (52:46 - 52:52)
if because we might have like (52:49 - 52:56)
30 cassettes left over in my house (52:52 - 52:56)
but we have to order a minimum of 50. (52:57 - 53:01)
but with a vinyl (53:00 - 53:04)
you can there is no minimum for a vinyl (53:01 - 53:06)
you can order just two vinyls (53:04 - 53:08)
the problem is whether you order two (53:06 - 53:09)
vinyls (53:08 - 53:12)
or 200 vinyls you have to pay for the (53:09 - 53:13)
mold (53:12 - 53:17)
of the vinyl to press it which is like (53:13 - 53:20)
1 500 bucks it doesn't matter how many (53:17 - 53:21)
you make (53:20 - 53:24)
that that molding cost is still gonna be (53:21 - 53:26)
the same (53:24 - 53:28)
so we wanted to do vinyls but we didn't (53:26 - 53:30)
think (53:28 - 53:33)
that people cared enough or wanted (53:30 - 53:36)
the music enough to get to a level where (53:33 - 53:38)
we could pay for a molding (53:36 - 53:40)
also i would probably argue more people (53:38 - 53:41)
have a (53:40 - 53:42)
record player than they do a cassette (53:41 - 53:45)
player actually that's what these days (53:42 - 53:47)
because hipsters yeah yeah hipsters yeah (53:45 - 53:51)
excuse me what (53:47 - 53:52)
i mean i'm probably a hipster hipster's (53:51 - 53:54)
brought it back hardcore (53:52 - 53:57)
i mean i've had yes i've had a turntable (53:54 - 53:58)
for some time (53:57 - 54:02)
you are a hipster i mean (53:58 - 54:04)
you deny it all you want i have a (54:02 - 54:05)
turntable (54:04 - 54:09)
i don't have a mustache no you don't (54:05 - 54:13)
probably for the best hey what (54:09 - 54:15)
that looks good with a beard to mustache (54:13 - 54:16)
no a beard yes (54:15 - 54:17)
there's a difference between a beard and (54:16 - 54:19)
mustache i mean i will say that i've (54:17 - 54:20)
never actually seen (54:19 - 54:23)
will with just a mustache i have seen (54:20 - 54:24)
recently (54:23 - 54:28)
okay send me is is this what our (54:24 - 54:29)
our 10th anniversary of this podcast has (54:28 - 54:31)
devolved into (54:29 - 54:34)
will anderson with a mustache yes and (54:31 - 54:37)

big wheel on the front and a little (54:39 - 54:44)
small wheel no (54:40 - 54:46)
you're gonna buy that one for your fancy (54:44 - 54:47)
bike rides (54:46 - 54:48)

like really low to the ground no (54:48 - 54:52)
oh are you gonna get one of those well (54:50 - 54:54)
the one with the (54:52 - 54:57)
like laying down bike no a recumbent (54:54 - 54:59)
bike i kind of want to run a little bike (54:57 - 55:00)
because now you're in my back (54:59 - 55:03)
oh butt word look i'm old but you are (55:00 - 55:05)
the two they're like i want (55:03 - 55:08)
that one wheel thing yeah the one wheel (55:05 - 55:10)
and now that i've started real (55:08 - 55:12)
skateboarding i'm kind of off on the one (55:10 - 55:13)
wheel oh my gosh real skateboarding is (55:12 - 55:15)
too much work (55:13 - 55:18)
i enjoyed the process (55:15 - 55:18)
steve you are so lazy it's like i (55:19 - 55:23)
skateboarded non-stop for like eight (55:21 - 55:25)
years of my life (55:23 - 55:27)
but the thing is steve is gonna get a (55:25 - 55:29)
one wheel and he'll use it for like a (55:27 - 55:31)
week or a week and a half and then he'll (55:29 - 55:32)
say all right (55:31 - 55:34)
done with that move on next thing (55:32 - 55:36)
probably (55:34 - 55:39)
did okay was were you skateboarding at (55:36 - 55:40)
the same time you had a chain wallet (55:39 - 55:43)
yeah oh yeah definitely oh i don't think (55:40 - 55:44)
i know you i don't think you could (55:43 - 55:50)
separate the two (55:44 - 55:50)
i was like like peanut butter and jelly (55:50 - 55:54)
right there (55:53 - 55:56)
oh two tastes that don't go great (55:54 - 56:00)
together ah champion's path (55:56 - 56:02)
what okay so champion's path is going to (56:00 - 56:03)

energies (57:08 - 57:13)
this is the hidden fates or the (57:09 - 57:16)
shining legends of this year and if we (57:13 - 57:17)
know anything about hidden faiths and (57:16 - 57:18)
shining legends (57:17 - 57:21)
they're garbage they're very hard to (57:18 - 57:22)
find (57:21 - 57:24)
they did not have booster packs for them (57:22 - 57:25)
well they do have booster packs but you (57:24 - 57:26)
can't buy booster packs (57:25 - 57:29)
single you have to buy them in etbs or (57:26 - 57:31)
blister packs (57:29 - 57:32)
so i can't get them at target is what (57:31 - 57:34)
you're saying you can you just have to (57:32 - 57:36)
get like the blister pack or the etb (57:34 - 57:39)
yeah btv elite trainer box (57:36 - 57:42)
okay uh so this will come out september (57:39 - 57:43)
25th (57:42 - 57:47)
initially but according to (57:43 - 57:47)
other sources that it's going to be a (57:47 - 57:51)
slow roll out (57:50 - 57:54)
um boxes planned like that the pin (57:51 - 57:55)
collection boxes you know where you get (57:54 - 57:58)
like four booster packs and a pin (57:55 - 58:00)
yeah uh those are gonna be coming out in (57:58 - 58:01)
november and then (58:00 - 58:04)
there are uh bigger boxes like there's a (58:01 - 58:06)
copper raja box where it's like big (58:04 - 58:07)
copper raja for booster packs a little (58:06 - 58:09)
copperage (58:07 - 58:10)
those are going to come out in like (58:09 - 58:12)
october so this is going to be a (58:10 - 58:16)
really slow release um but this is kind (58:12 - 58:18)
of how hidden fates was (58:16 - 58:20)
and shining legends i believe they they (58:18 - 58:22)
do an initial release it all sells out (58:20 - 58:25)
and then once it becomes like fall (58:22 - 58:27)
they'll do more (58:25 - 58:28)
is this the last set for the year or (58:27 - 58:29)
will there be one more there will be (58:28 - 58:31)
another set this is the special set for (58:29 - 58:32)
the year (58:31 - 58:36)
okay so is the gym thing just (58:32 - 58:39)
a theme or does it actually like (58:36 - 58:42)
i think we're like gym trainers as cards (58:39 - 58:45)
this set is based off of (58:42 - 58:48)
two sets that exists already one set is (58:45 - 58:51)
legendary heartbeat um so legendary (58:48 - 58:51)
heartbeat (58:51 - 58:55)
has the outcry me v alchemy v-max (58:51 - 59:00)
colossal colossal v-max uh it also has (58:55 - 59:02)
um some of the items that we'll probably (59:00 - 59:04)
see like heroes metal and (59:02 - 59:05)
cape of toughness although i don't know (59:04 - 59:07)
if those items are out i know there's (59:05 - 59:08)
ultra rare (59:07 - 59:10)
rares in that so legendary heartbeat is (59:08 - 59:11)
the special set (59:10 - 59:14)
in japan right now if you saw any (59:11 - 59:17)
pictures on twitter or anything of like (59:14 - 59:20)
the rainbow raiku rainbow jirachi (59:17 - 59:23)
rainbow suicune uh it's like these (59:20 - 59:25)
different type of holographic cards (59:23 - 59:26)
where (59:25 - 59:28)
it's like jirachi but in front of like (59:26 - 59:30)
this rainbow explosion (59:28 - 59:32)
they're really really cool i don't know (59:30 - 59:34)
if those specific cards will be in (59:32 - 59:38)
in champions path the etb for champions (59:34 - 59:39)
path the elite trainer box has (59:38 - 59:42)
charizard on it gmat of gigantomax (59:39 - 59:43)
charizard (59:42 - 59:46)
but those came from a different set um (59:43 - 59:48)
so those came from the vmax (59:46 - 59:51)
starter sets they were exclusive like (59:48 - 59:53)
decks that came out earlier this year in (59:51 - 59:55)
japan in march (59:53 - 59:56)
so there was a gmat there was a (59:55 - 59:58)
charizard v max starter set and a grim (59:56 - 60:00)
snarl vmax starter set (59:58 - 60:02)
and those came with vmax charizard (60:00 - 60:04)
charizard v (60:02 - 60:07)
v grim snarl grim snarl v max (60:04 - 60:09)
so those cards will be in the champions (60:07 - 60:11)
path as well (60:09 - 60:12)
i don't think we have a full listing of (60:11 - 60:15)
all the cards in champions path (60:12 - 60:16)
they just say there's it comes out (60:15 - 60:18)
september 25th (60:16 - 60:21)
they'll have 70 cards i'm i am (60:18 - 60:24)
so so positive that because they're put (60:21 - 60:27)
charizard on the etb this is going to be (60:24 - 60:28)
impossible to find (60:27 - 60:32)
this year if there's somebody at target (60:28 - 60:33)
to get his for you (60:32 - 60:35)
well it should go to target right does (60:33 - 60:36)
he carry those targets should (60:35 - 60:38)
yeah definitely target carry target (60:36 - 60:40)
carried you know hidden fates shining (60:38 - 60:41)
legends (60:40 - 60:43)
and for the most part you'd be able to (60:41 - 60:44)
find them (60:43 - 60:47)
but if you went like the week it came (60:44 - 60:49)
out but if there's (60:47 - 60:51)
if we if we figure out that like i don't (60:49 - 60:53)
know i'll crummy v max is worth 500 (60:51 - 60:54)
bucks which (60:53 - 60:56)
i know it won't be but if there's a if (60:54 - 60:57)
there's a really expensive card (60:56 - 60:59)
it's going to it's going to sell out (60:57 - 61:02)
faster well you just pre-order from your (60:59 - 61:07)
lgs man yeah i have a friend who (61:02 - 61:10)
runs a tcg online store (61:07 - 61:12)
and apparently they pre-ordered multiple (61:10 - 61:14)
boxes and they all got rejected and they (61:12 - 61:16)
had to cancel their customers pre-orders (61:14 - 61:17)
because (61:16 - 61:19)
the distributor was like we're only (61:17 - 61:22)
going to send you two boxes not 90 boxes (61:19 - 61:25)
oh dang then you pre-order directly from (61:22 - 61:26)
the distributor (61:25 - 61:28)
if anybody needs a distributor i can (61:26 - 61:30)
give you a couple i know some okay (61:28 - 61:32)
i guess we'll we'll probably have some (61:30 - 61:33)
news closer to champion's path darkness (61:32 - 61:34)
ablaze though (61:33 - 61:37)
should be coming out and darkness ablaze (61:34 - 61:39)
is the new set comes out i think the (61:37 - 61:40)
14th (61:39 - 61:42)
of august although i'm sure there are (61:40 - 61:44)
probably some stores selling it early (61:42 - 61:47)
wait the new set for english yes (61:44 - 61:50)
english okay in japan it was called (61:47 - 61:51)
infinity zone it used to be called (61:50 - 61:53)
worlds down (61:51 - 61:54)
so japan right now has legendary (61:53 - 61:58)
heartbeat infinity zone was before that (61:54 - 62:02)
we our last set was rebel clash (61:58 - 62:04)
and so our new set is darkness ablaze (62:02 - 62:06)
and then we'll have one more set for (62:04 - 62:08)
the year that isn't champion's path (62:06 - 62:10)

stamina by gems (63:12 - 63:17)
or by uh rewards from your present box (63:14 - 63:21)
you can pass the maximum using gems (63:17 - 63:24)
or present box stuff please note there (63:21 - 63:27)
is a second replenishment limit beyond (63:24 - 63:28)
maximum (63:27 - 63:29)
stamina i don't know what that means i'm (63:28 - 63:32)
there i'm there is it (63:29 - 63:34)
is it nine is it past 900 because i had (63:32 - 63:36)
a warning saying like you can't go back (63:34 - 63:39)
you can't go you can't go past a (63:36 - 63:40)
thousand oh okay okay okay (63:39 - 63:45)
so 999 is the max which i've been at (63:40 - 63:48)
for since it came out yeah (63:45 - 63:50)
uh i want to talk about that they (63:48 - 63:52)
introduced skip tickets finally (63:50 - 63:55)
that was uh that was all me thank you (63:52 - 63:56)
thank you it was (63:55 - 63:57)
not it was not you didn't even you (63:56 - 63:59)
didn't even know they existed what's (63:57 - 64:00)
cause of me (63:59 - 64:03)
when they asked for every time dna has (64:00 - 64:04)
asked for feedback from me and the other (64:03 - 64:05)
partners (64:04 - 64:07)
i feel like you better tell them about (64:05 - 64:08)
skip tickets (64:07 - 64:10)
because i need skip tickets in my life (64:08 - 64:12)
for this dumb game (64:10 - 64:15)
i i said skip tickets would be nice (64:12 - 64:16)
these are the games that have skipped (64:15 - 64:19)
tickets that do it well these are some (64:16 - 64:21)
examples i think you even said greg that (64:19 - 64:22)
these were some games that had skip (64:21 - 64:24)
tickets that didn't do it well (64:22 - 64:27)
yep so i i wrote that all up i sent it (64:24 - 64:28)
to them (64:27 - 64:30)
at least twice um and i think i was the (64:28 - 64:32)
only person arguing for skip tickets i'm (64:30 - 64:34)
not sure if anyone else was (64:32 - 64:37)
um there was like one feedback form that (64:34 - 64:38)
was public (64:37 - 64:40)
i was the only one that mentioned skip (64:38 - 64:41)
tickets and then there was a private one (64:40 - 64:42)
so (64:41 - 64:44)
but skip tickets are here i give us (64:42 - 64:46)
gifts i i doubt it was me (64:44 - 64:48)
i'm sure they looked at other games that (64:46 - 64:52)
were successful with skip tickets yeah (64:48 - 64:55)
uh there's player ranked now player rank (64:52 - 64:56)
will go up when you just do battles and (64:55 - 64:59)
stuff but also player rank will increase (64:56 - 65:03)
your maximum stamina so you start at 40. (64:59 - 65:05)
when you get to level two it'll go from (65:03 - 65:07)
40 to 45 (65:05 - 65:09)
when two or more sync pairs of the same (65:07 - 65:10)
type are placed in a team (65:09 - 65:13)
type skill is activated strengthening (65:10 - 65:15)
all members in the team (65:13 - 65:16)
uh this would be for example if you put (65:15 - 65:19)
like wrote like elisa (65:16 - 65:23)
your player character and sophocles all (65:19 - 65:25)
on a team they all have electric (65:23 - 65:28)
they would get a boost there's a new (65:25 - 65:29)
training area (65:28 - 65:31)
to coincide with the removal of super (65:29 - 65:32)
courses the (65:31 - 65:35)
current training area is renamed ex (65:32 - 65:37)
plaza and the brand new training area (65:35 - 65:39)
will be placed where items can (65:37 - 65:40)
strengthen sink pairs (65:39 - 65:43)
so there's a level up arena a cap unlock (65:40 - 65:45)
arena an evolution material arena and a (65:43 - 65:46)
sink orb arena so i think those are (65:45 - 65:48)
pretty straightforward as a new player (65:46 - 65:50)
to pokemon masters (65:48 - 65:53)
there was a lot of menus to look at and (65:50 - 65:55)
now there are just four (65:53 - 65:57)
like hey if i want to evolve my pokemon (65:55 - 66:01)
oh i can go to the evolution area (65:57 - 66:03)
yeah so they made that pretty (66:01 - 66:05)
straightforward (66:03 - 66:07)
there's move candy coins so while they (66:05 - 66:08)
did make the thing simpler they added (66:07 - 66:10)
this move candy (66:08 - 66:11)
you'll be able to collect a certain (66:10 - 66:13)
amount of move candy to exchange for 5 (66:11 - 66:15)
star move candy (66:13 - 66:18)
as listed below move candy coin comes in (66:15 - 66:20)
four types (66:18 - 66:23)
so there's move candy coin strike move (66:20 - 66:23)
candy coin (66:23 - 66:26)
support move candy coin and tech move (66:23 - 66:27)
candy coin (66:26 - 66:30)
i think all of these are good except uh (66:27 - 66:31)
i guess some people (66:30 - 66:34)
might not like the stamina some people (66:31 - 66:34)
may (66:34 - 66:38)
like it told you guys all how i play so (66:34 - 66:40)
i knew this wouldn't affect me (66:38 - 66:44)
i mean so far i i don't play a lot um (66:40 - 66:48)
but right now i'm at uh level 13 (66:44 - 66:52)
uh the max stamina i can have is 96 (66:48 - 66:56)
and i currently have 845. (66:52 - 66:59)
the wax you can have is oh wait what (66:56 - 67:00)
repeat those (66:59 - 67:03)
so the limit of what it will restore is (67:00 - 67:04)
96 but (67:03 - 67:06)
since they've been giving away this week (67:04 - 67:08)
with stamina they give out like 200 at a (67:06 - 67:09)
time (67:08 - 67:12)
and that goes above i have been (67:09 - 67:16)
at 999 and then until i use some stamina (67:12 - 67:18)
so right now i'm at 8 45 (67:16 - 67:20)
i have a gift for another 200 that is (67:18 - 67:22)
literally sitting in my box (67:20 - 67:24)
waiting for me to drop down so i can (67:22 - 67:25)
accept it (67:24 - 67:27)
and replenish it all the problem is of (67:25 - 67:28)
course (67:27 - 67:30)
every time i go up a level because i'm (67:28 - 67:32)
in the early stages of the game it (67:30 - 67:33)
replenishes (67:32 - 67:37)
my stamina up and i can never (67:33 - 67:38)
take advantage of that gift without (67:37 - 67:40)
burning through (67:38 - 67:42)
right so i'm at level 6 tickets 15 i (67:40 - 67:44)
have 108 (67:42 - 67:48)
total stamp stamima stamina (67:44 - 67:51)
and i'm at a max of 851 and just like (67:48 - 67:52)
you i have like four (67:51 - 67:55)
gifts in my present box that i cannot (67:52 - 67:57)
redeem because because it will put you (67:55 - 67:59)
over it it will put me in a good (67:57 - 68:01)
it's a good problem to have and if you (67:59 - 68:03)
play the game (68:01 - 68:05)
right you will always have plenty of (68:03 - 68:06)
stamina like (68:05 - 68:09)
just don't burn don't burn yourself down (68:06 - 68:10)
below (68:09 - 68:13)
your natural like 200 a day (68:10 - 68:18)
is easy to get everything done uh also (68:13 - 68:21)
the very first thing you should do is (68:18 - 68:24)
unlock the super level of (68:21 - 68:28)
the level up course get that done (68:24 - 68:29)
so you're getting because they added (68:28 - 68:31)
book four (68:29 - 68:34)
so you get those it has no limit on how (68:31 - 68:35)
many times you can run it (68:34 - 68:38)
and once you've cleared it and you get (68:35 - 68:40)
the ability to use skip tickets (68:38 - 68:42)
you can put any team together that you (68:40 - 68:43)
want (68:42 - 68:45)
so anybody who you think oh i need to (68:43 - 68:47)
get experience on them (68:45 - 68:49)
pop them in there because it it's not (68:47 - 68:51)
going to check like it already knows you (68:49 - 68:52)
passed (68:51 - 68:53)
so if you have all level ones that you (68:52 - 68:55)
want to level up (68:53 - 68:58)
put them into that course skip ticket (68:55 - 68:59)
twice (68:58 - 69:02)
and they get all the experience that's (68:59 - 69:03)
naturally given (69:02 - 69:06)
without having to waste any books it's (69:03 - 69:06)
an (69:06 - 69:09)
easy way to get experience that would (69:06 - 69:09)
other be (69:09 - 69:11)
otherwise be wasted on the team that (69:09 - 69:12)
cleared that for you (69:11 - 69:14)
you can spread it around to everybody (69:12 - 69:17)
else it's one of the greatest things of (69:14 - 69:19)
all games that do skip tickets right is (69:17 - 69:21)
being able to use the xp (69:19 - 69:23)
and not have it be wasted this was my (69:21 - 69:25)
question uh (69:23 - 69:27)
so in order to use a skip ticket you (69:25 - 69:29)
have to complete a level without (69:27 - 69:32)
any of your sink pairs dying right (69:29 - 69:35)
which is a little bit harder on the (69:32 - 69:36)
highest (69:35 - 69:38)
difficulties yes but is that how other (69:36 - 69:40)
games do it like you have to complete (69:38 - 69:41)
with no (69:40 - 69:44)
faints in order to skip yeah you have to (69:41 - 69:45)
you have to get (69:44 - 69:47)
a three star rating whatever that (69:45 - 69:48)
requirement (69:47 - 69:50)
is and once you have a full three star (69:48 - 69:51)
rating meaning (69:50 - 69:54)
you've passed it according to how we (69:51 - 69:56)
want it to get passed (69:54 - 69:59)
um then you can skip it all you want (69:56 - 70:00)
yeah (69:59 - 70:02)
uh the good thing about the level up (70:00 - 70:03)
drill top (70:02 - 70:07)
super hard is that it's rock based (70:03 - 70:10)
uh and olivia is still (70:07 - 70:13)
one of the best olivia we're out here (70:10 - 70:15)
using cynthia (70:13 - 70:18)
uh isn't cynthia better than olivia but (70:15 - 70:19)
cynthia's ground (70:18 - 70:22)
and not rock right oh (70:19 - 70:24)
yeah dan rock yeah no no you're right (70:22 - 70:26)
it's great nothing is disgruntled i just (70:24 - 70:27)
put those two together i think i'm (70:26 - 70:28)
thinking of hapu (70:27 - 70:30)
which i think oh cynthia is better than (70:28 - 70:33)
hapu when it comes to ground (70:30 - 70:36)
but you can just you can wreck that (70:33 - 70:36)
level (70:36 - 70:38)
quickly with olivia because they're all (70:36 - 70:40)
weak to rock and then once you've (70:38 - 70:41)
cleared it (70:40 - 70:43)
you can like like i have the bug event (70:41 - 70:44)
and my (70:43 - 70:48)
pokemon were those sink pairs were lower (70:44 - 70:48)
experience (70:48 - 70:50)
so i just put my bug team in there and i (70:48 - 70:52)
said give me 10 (70:50 - 70:54)
give me 10 turns on this one i get all (70:52 - 70:55)
those books (70:54 - 70:56)
and i get all that experience on my (70:55 - 70:58)
other team it's (70:56 - 71:02)
it's brilliant um so i'm really happy (70:58 - 71:04)
with (71:02 - 71:06)
the skip tip it function i'm so far fine (71:04 - 71:07)
with (71:06 - 71:10)
the stamina because the stamina (71:07 - 71:14)
cost seems to be mostly in line with the (71:10 - 71:16)
rewards that you get (71:14 - 71:17)
and they've been really generous this (71:16 - 71:19)
week with the stamina so (71:17 - 71:21)
as long as i do my standard and just (71:19 - 71:23)
keep myself (71:21 - 71:25)
way up in the heavens i will never have (71:23 - 71:26)
a stamina worry (71:25 - 71:28)
yeah so yeah obviously uh full (71:26 - 71:30)
disclosure i'm partnered with dna i knew (71:28 - 71:32)
a lot of these changes were coming for (71:30 - 71:33)
quite a while (71:32 - 71:35)
um and they asked for my feedback on (71:33 - 71:37)
them this is this is (71:35 - 71:38)
what i'm about to say has nothing to do (71:37 - 71:40)
with dna i'm gonna put a tin (71:38 - 71:43)
tin foil hat on though (71:40 - 71:43)
so i i went down a dark deep path (71:44 - 71:50)
of of probably tin foil theories (71:47 - 71:54)
but what i heard or what i read i should (71:50 - 71:55)
say (71:54 - 71:58)
is that the these um (71:55 - 72:02)
stamina systems aren't designed (71:58 - 72:06)
to limit the players they're designed (72:02 - 72:10)
in part to stop bots from (72:06 - 72:12)
grinding out accounts and then selling (72:10 - 72:13)
the accounts (72:12 - 72:16)
so once you build in a system (72:13 - 72:19)
and then you build in things like gifts (72:16 - 72:21)
where they gift you 200 (72:19 - 72:25)
stamina for free it stops the bots (72:21 - 72:27)
from doing what they're doing because it (72:25 - 72:29)
requires more human interaction to (72:27 - 72:32)
yeah and so the comparison before it hit (72:29 - 72:34)
pokemon masters was (72:32 - 72:36)
that this was a huge issue in fire (72:34 - 72:37)
emblem heroes (72:36 - 72:40)
fire emblem heroes rolled out stamina (72:37 - 72:42)
after (72:40 - 72:43)
i don't know how fast they rolled it out (72:42 - 72:45)
they rolled it out pretty quickly though (72:43 - 72:46)
i think (72:45 - 72:48)
and so people who still play fire emblem (72:46 - 72:50)
heroes they've never really run out of (72:48 - 72:51)
stamina (72:50 - 72:53)
because of how many gifts they do of (72:51 - 72:56)
like here's 200 stamina here's a refresh (72:53 - 72:56)
here's (72:56 - 72:59)
potions to refresh um so that game has (72:56 - 73:02)
been out for what like four years (72:59 - 73:04)
and yeah i'm sure there are some really (73:02 - 73:05)
really hardcore players that hit the (73:04 - 73:07)
limit and then they use the gems or (73:05 - 73:07)
whatever (73:07 - 73:11)
to refresh it but that that's the (73:07 - 73:13)
the tin hat theory like this system (73:11 - 73:15)
wasn't designed to punish us for playing (73:13 - 73:18)
it was designed to like stop robots from (73:15 - 73:20)
grinding out and then selling it (73:18 - 73:23)
i i don't think those two things (73:20 - 73:27)
are exclusive i think it stops bots (73:23 - 73:28)
which (73:27 - 73:31)
have always been a problem but it also (73:28 - 73:34)
stops people who who who (73:31 - 73:38)
treat it like who are actual robots who (73:34 - 73:41)
who act like robots i i think both can (73:38 - 73:43)
happen i think the human one is a lot (73:41 - 73:44)
less common (73:43 - 73:46)
but there are people who will burn (73:44 - 73:49)
through it um and then want to spend (73:46 - 73:53)
gems the other thing is (73:49 - 73:56)
we don't know yet how likely they are (73:53 - 73:58)
continuing these gifts (73:56 - 74:02)
right like these gifts could just be for (73:58 - 74:03)
the first month of (74:02 - 74:05)
of launch and then they stop giving you (74:03 - 74:06)
stamina gifts (74:05 - 74:09)
which is pretty common like they tend to (74:06 - 74:11)
only do stamina gifts (74:09 - 74:14)
uh for special events um dragalia lost (74:11 - 74:18)
built a thing where you can get (74:14 - 74:21)
stamina from upgrading your castle as (74:18 - 74:22)
part of (74:21 - 74:24)
having to interact with that menu but (74:22 - 74:25)
that came (74:24 - 74:29)
years after their that game had launched (74:25 - 74:32)
um the bot problem is real and i i (74:29 - 74:34)
i don't think that's like tin foil hat (74:32 - 74:37)
territory i think it does stop that (74:34 - 74:38)
problem (74:37 - 74:39)
i don't know if that was a huge problem (74:38 - 74:41)
in pokemon masters though since there's (74:39 - 74:43)
just not (74:41 - 74:46)
it's not a lot of pvp really yet (74:43 - 74:47)
there were those accounts on ebay that (74:46 - 74:50)
we found (74:47 - 74:50)
yeah i mean they have to sell (74:50 - 74:55)
the other thing that they've done in (74:54 - 74:57)
masters is they added the (74:55 - 75:00)
the summer sink pairs that we speculated (74:57 - 75:00)
about (75:00 - 75:03)
yeah um so we have stephen and alolan (75:00 - 75:05)
sandslash and the other one we were (75:03 - 75:08)
we were way off the mark on was lyra and (75:05 - 75:10)
jigglypuff (75:08 - 75:13)
yep my my next complaint is (75:10 - 75:16)
the pulling system still stinks (75:13 - 75:19)
it still feels bad the steel fat still (75:16 - 75:23)
feels bad to pull a 10 pull and get (75:19 - 75:25)
a solid roster of three stars that you (75:23 - 75:27)
have so many of (75:25 - 75:29)
and not a single guarantee of getting a (75:27 - 75:31)
four star at least (75:29 - 75:33)
yeah that's like just the one like ten (75:31 - 75:34)
polls just don't (75:33 - 75:37)
have no there's no benefit there's no (75:34 - 75:38)
benefit it's just frustrating (75:37 - 75:42)
it's just i get my frustration done fast (75:38 - 75:44)
other than slow and that's the only (75:42 - 75:46)
reason to pull 10 balls (75:44 - 75:48)
polling still feels really bad in this (75:46 - 75:50)
game (75:48 - 75:53)
serena on one pole it feels real good (75:50 - 75:54)
yeah (75:53 - 75:57)
well but that's really rare and (75:54 - 76:00)
it felt it felt (75:57 - 76:02)
it felt good for a while when they were (76:00 - 76:03)
being more generous with (76:02 - 76:07)
their gifts uh that has ended (76:03 - 76:09)
uh they did a one big dump for bug fixes (76:07 - 76:10)
and changing the game (76:09 - 76:14)
massively um but we gave everyone 3 000 (76:10 - 76:15)
gems for this update (76:14 - 76:18)
yeah that's what i'm saying like they (76:15 - 76:19)
gave this one (76:18 - 76:24)
which got you a 10 pull which feels bad (76:19 - 76:25)
because it's you're just still not (76:24 - 76:27)
guaranteed anything (76:25 - 76:29)
uh and then they've really slowed down (76:27 - 76:31)
giving you gems again (76:29 - 76:34)
so trying to work back up to just do a (76:31 - 76:35)
one pull is (76:34 - 76:39)
once again a multi-day process (76:35 - 76:42)
which since you aren't guaranteed is (76:39 - 76:44)
just like i'm gonna get another bryson (76:42 - 76:46)
man i'm gonna get another bugsy (76:44 - 76:48)
i'm gonna get another thing that i don't (76:46 - 76:50)
need more of it's just de-incentivizing (76:48 - 76:51)
to (76:50 - 76:54)
find that aspect fund and i know it's to (76:51 - 76:55)
drive money (76:54 - 76:58)
which it's just that also feels weird it (76:55 - 76:58)
also (76:58 - 77:02)
just feels like just blatant give us (76:58 - 77:02)
money (77:02 - 77:05)
and you'll give us money and we will (77:02 - 77:06)
guarantee it (77:05 - 77:09)
then and it's that's just i still think (77:06 - 77:10)
that (77:09 - 77:12)
aspect of this game is really ugly i i (77:10 - 77:14)
do not like it (77:12 - 77:16)
yeah i just wish the premium currency (77:14 - 77:18)
was called something different (77:16 - 77:20)
mm-hmm i don't yep i don't like that (77:18 - 77:22)
they're both called gems but one is paid (77:20 - 77:24)
and one is freed (77:22 - 77:27)
they were like gems and diamonds coins (77:24 - 77:28)
diamonds they already got they already (77:27 - 77:31)
got coins in the game i know (77:28 - 77:34)
pearls name one coins pearls no name one (77:31 - 77:35)
pearl then one name (77:34 - 77:37)
one diamond and then the name the last (77:35 - 77:38)
one platinum (77:37 - 77:40)
look if they do diamond jennifer (77:38 - 77:43)
remake's confirmed (77:40 - 77:44)
uh hey i pulled that summer stephen i'm (77:43 - 77:46)
pretty excited (77:44 - 77:49)
i have not uh i am (77:46 - 77:52)
very i'm super happy with the update (77:49 - 77:54)
i don't know if i said that i like yeah (77:52 - 77:58)
i'm happy with the updates um (77:54 - 78:01)
taken a lot of the grind feel out of it (77:58 - 78:02)
which was their goal (78:01 - 78:05)
which was their goal i think the new (78:02 - 78:07)
level up your team menu (78:05 - 78:09)
is really overwhelming like if you are (78:07 - 78:11)
stepping into this game (78:09 - 78:14)
looking at that it's like oh boy what (78:11 - 78:16)
this is like a huge list of things that (78:14 - 78:18)
i have to micromanage for this team (78:16 - 78:21)
and i think they need a slightly i think (78:18 - 78:22)
they need to (78:21 - 78:24)
crunch that down a little so it just (78:22 - 78:26)
doesn't feel like (78:24 - 78:29)
i there are so many menus that i have to (78:26 - 78:31)
click on and you really don't have to (78:29 - 78:32)
but it (78:31 - 78:35)
like they don't really differentiate (78:32 - 78:36)
them like (78:35 - 78:38)
i think that's overwhelming and could be (78:36 - 78:39)
cleaned up a lot (78:38 - 78:42)
i love the skip tickets love it (78:39 - 78:44)
seriously i love them too (78:42 - 78:47)
in case anybody wanted my opinion you (78:44 - 78:49)
don't even play (78:47 - 78:53)
i meant gardenscape skip tickets oh yes (78:49 - 78:55)
past this garden level you should log in (78:53 - 78:57)
though will you get your three thousand (78:55 - 78:57)
gems (78:57 - 78:59)
you can save it for uh your favorite (78:57 - 79:01)
sure um (78:59 - 79:05)
which is alder and victini (79:01 - 79:07)
if the game didn't completely aggravate (79:05 - 79:08)
me every time i logged in (79:07 - 79:10)
i'd consider it but it's just i don't (79:08 - 79:13)
need that kind of emotional disturbance (79:10 - 79:14)
in my life right now (79:13 - 79:17)
well speaking of emotional disturbance (79:14 - 79:18)
the power of us (79:17 - 79:21)
is now on pokemon tv don't watch it (79:18 - 79:24)
for the next two weeks you can see ash (79:21 - 79:26)
and pikachu and a whole cast of unique (79:24 - 79:29)
characters that's it we're done that's (79:26 - 79:30)
it (79:29 - 79:31)
and people are going to tweet i couldn't (79:30 - 79:33)
help but watch it and we were warning (79:31 - 79:35)
you we are warning you (79:33 - 79:39)
to not watch it it's not it's not great (79:35 - 79:42)
you all got to listen just trust us we (79:39 - 79:44)
are producing a watch party tonight (79:42 - 79:47)
you are so awful sword and shield has (79:44 - 79:48)
some new raids (79:47 - 79:51)
raid rotation happened it is uh pretty (79:48 - 79:52)
uneventful (79:51 - 79:55)
are they new really not none of the (79:52 - 79:57)
pokemon in the raids that are being (79:55 - 79:58)
promoted (79:57 - 80:02)
are our dlc pokemon (79:58 - 80:05)
um so it's quagsire milotic (80:02 - 80:09)
gastrodon hippodon dreadna and (80:05 - 80:10)
sandaconda (80:09 - 80:12)
santikana and dredena have the ability (80:10 - 80:14)
to dynomax (80:12 - 80:17)
gigantomax um and those are appearing (80:14 - 80:19)
between three and five-star raids of (80:17 - 80:20)
course if you beat the game (80:19 - 80:22)
that's all you're seeing is three to (80:20 - 80:23)
five stars you did not beat the game (80:22 - 80:24)
you're seeing one to two stars so you (80:23 - 80:25)
would expect (80:24 - 80:30)
fibas cellos hippopotas etc (80:25 - 80:32)
and these are the raids for the next 30 (80:30 - 80:33)
days uh (80:32 - 80:36)
i guess until august 31st (80:33 - 80:38)
now the question is are they going to do (80:36 - 80:40)
another (80:38 - 80:43)
wailord weekend and change the raids for (80:40 - 80:46)
48 hours and increase the shiny chance (80:43 - 80:48)
or was that just a weird one-off thing (80:46 - 80:52)
because i think 30 days for these raids (80:48 - 80:56)
are pretty underwhelming (80:52 - 80:58)
yeah do you mean in all of history or (80:56 - 81:00)
just in the next month (80:58 - 81:03)
in the next month in the next month (81:00 - 81:03)
uh which i don't even think that like i (81:03 - 81:06)
think (81:06 - 81:08)
the way the whaler week was cool minus (81:06 - 81:10)
the fact they didn't announce it minus (81:08 - 81:12)
the fact that it was (81:10 - 81:15)
a little short it was like i think (81:12 - 81:18)
friday night at seven into sunday till (81:15 - 81:19)
seven so 48 hours (81:18 - 81:21)
it'd been nice if it was maybe like (81:19 - 81:23)
friday saturday sunday (81:21 - 81:25)
uh or maybe thursday friday saturday (81:23 - 81:27)
sunday just not saturday sunday (81:25 - 81:30)
uh but i guess we'll see but man these (81:27 - 81:31)
raids are not (81:30 - 81:34)
yeah not having anyone rush back to turn (81:31 - 81:37)
on their switch unfortunately (81:34 - 81:39)
well i'm still playing isle of armor so (81:37 - 81:41)
i turn my switch on every day (81:39 - 81:43)
yeah i made a little graphic for it i (81:41 - 81:44)
also made a (81:43 - 81:45)
little cheat sheet if you want more (81:44 - 81:47)
wishing pieces just in case you want to (81:45 - 81:51)
stock up for if there is another (81:47 - 81:52)
way alert event you can just wishing (81:51 - 81:55)
peace your way to there (81:52 - 81:58)
for the the scam-o-matic (81:55 - 82:01)
that's pretty much it that is that is (81:58 - 82:02)
all the news we got (82:01 - 82:05)
i think we went through it all i wonder (82:02 - 82:07)
if that battle academy is on amazon (82:05 - 82:10)

question of the question of the (82:41 - 82:46)
week (82:44 - 82:46)
boy getting rick rolled doesn't feel so (82:47 - 82:52)
bad when it's so gentle and nicely done (82:49 - 82:55)
go for it uh this is from franco what is (82:52 - 82:57)
the ideal way to play through a pokemon (82:55 - 82:58)
game in each of your opinion from an (82:57 - 83:01)
experience or a new player or a nuzlocke (82:58 - 83:01)
or an (83:01 - 83:04)
sbq verse alongside (83:01 - 83:08)
the anime etc etc what's an sbq (83:04 - 83:11)
yeah shiny badge quest oh ooh (83:08 - 83:14)
okay will anderson's going first and (83:11 - 83:15)
jump into the lead number one (83:14 - 83:18)
nuzz locks are garbage throw them out (83:15 - 83:20)
stop living your life that bad way shiny (83:18 - 83:20)
badge quest (83:20 - 83:24)
ain't nobody got time for that (83:20 - 83:26)
unless unless i got 500 people watching (83:24 - 83:28)
me and paying me (83:26 - 83:31)
the bits little bitties and subscription (83:28 - 83:33)
fees (83:31 - 83:35)
no the best way to play a pokemon game (83:33 - 83:36)
is to (83:35 - 83:39)
uh as you go discover the new pokemon (83:36 - 83:41)
try not to see as many spoilers (83:39 - 83:43)
ahead of time as you can and then just (83:41 - 83:45)
add the delightful pokemon that you come (83:43 - 83:46)
across that you enjoy (83:45 - 83:48)
to your team try to keep them evenly (83:46 - 83:49)
leveled as you go (83:48 - 83:52)
and enjoy the experience okay there was (83:49 - 83:54)
a uh (83:52 - 83:57)
poll that took place in (83:54 - 84:01)
on the uh pokemon secret club page (83:57 - 84:03)
which no longer exists they closed it (84:01 - 84:04)
down lasted a solid (84:03 - 84:08)
four months secret club uh that asked (84:04 - 84:10)
how people play through a game whether (84:08 - 84:11)
they i think the (84:10 - 84:14)
the question was do you play through (84:11 - 84:14)
with like (84:14 - 84:18)
one partner or like six partners (84:14 - 84:21)
so pretty much like what what a lot of (84:18 - 84:22)
like eight-year-olds did when they (84:21 - 84:23)
played red and blue they just like (84:22 - 84:25)
picked charmander and then they (84:23 - 84:27)
they just they tried to catch other (84:25 - 84:29)
pokemon but it was too much work so they (84:27 - 84:31)
just (84:29 - 84:32)
a lot of people do that they just play (84:31 - 84:34)
with one pokemon yeah so they just have (84:32 - 84:35)
like (84:34 - 84:37)
over leveled 80 charizard at the end and (84:35 - 84:40)
everything else is like level 14. (84:37 - 84:43)
and it was like 34 of people just did (84:40 - 84:45)
that that was just (84:43 - 84:46)
and the secret club was a paid (84:45 - 84:48)
membership so you had to pay five (84:46 - 84:49)
dollars to get into the secret you had (84:48 - 84:51)
to go to a pokemon center in japan (84:49 - 84:53)
pay the five dollars register it and (84:51 - 84:56)
then like (84:53 - 84:58)
like half a million people took this (84:56 - 84:59)
poll and (84:58 - 85:02)
34 of them were just i'm using one (84:59 - 85:03)
pokemon (85:02 - 85:05)
and that's fine i mean like there's no (85:03 - 85:07)
if that's how you want to play the game (85:05 - 85:08)
that's cool (85:07 - 85:09)
that's how i'm playing through gala (85:08 - 85:11)
darkness right now and surviving i was (85:09 - 85:13)
like i'm using espeon and i guess i'm (85:11 - 85:16)
using hound hour (85:13 - 85:19)
because it's working i'm not switching (85:16 - 85:21)
my pokemon i'm using these two they're (85:19 - 85:23)
getting all the experience (85:21 - 85:25)
they are one-shotting everything i do (85:23 - 85:26)
not want to switch i do not want to (85:25 - 85:28)
level up the steady horse anymore (85:26 - 85:32)
i do not want to level up this ball toy (85:28 - 85:35)
um and i am (85:32 - 85:38)
yeah and i'm having fun that way like (85:35 - 85:39)
the espeon's good (85:38 - 85:41)
the hound doom's good i'm one-shotting (85:39 - 85:44)
everything there's a lot of battles back (85:41 - 85:46)
to back to back to back to back (85:44 - 85:47)
getting through those quicker is more (85:46 - 85:49)
enjoyable for me (85:47 - 85:52)
i think i would have a less fun time (85:49 - 85:56)
if i tried to make a balanced team (85:52 - 85:59)
because i did that two years ago and i (85:56 - 86:00)
lost that memory card (85:59 - 86:02)
but let me tell you as much as i like (86:00 - 86:04)
del cady (86:02 - 86:09)
del cady was not pulling her weight (86:04 - 86:11)
i put so much time and experience into (86:09 - 86:14)
her and her hyper beam did like (86:11 - 86:16)
20 nothing damage and then i lost the (86:14 - 86:19)
turn and then she got one shot (86:16 - 86:22)
i just i'm having more fun this way um (86:19 - 86:25)
when i i played through all of crystal i (86:22 - 86:26)
had to play through it twice because i (86:25 - 86:28)
wanted to transfer a master ball over (86:26 - 86:29)
and stuff (86:28 - 86:31)
and i just went through crystal with a (86:29 - 86:34)
uh for alligator (86:31 - 86:35)
and that's all i used was for (86:34 - 86:37)
alligatoring it was (86:35 - 86:40)
fine it was fun um a lot of speedrunners (86:37 - 86:42)
they play through with one pokemon just (86:40 - 86:43)
because it's more efficient (86:42 - 86:45)
but if i'm taking my time and going (86:43 - 86:47)
through a game uh (86:45 - 86:49)
i like to add the new pokemon to my team (86:47 - 86:50)
and i think (86:49 - 86:53)
the changes to experience share gives (86:50 - 86:55)
you that opportunity to experiment (86:53 - 86:59)
more than in like ruby and sapphire (86:55 - 87:00)
where you're just like oh you're not (86:59 - 87:02)
giving me an experience here until (87:00 - 87:05)
very later into the game uh okay i guess (87:02 - 87:09)
we're just gonna keep using talo then (87:05 - 87:10)
i think the changes they made have made (87:09 - 87:13)
it easier to level up your team (87:10 - 87:18)
uh so the ideal way to play through a (87:13 - 87:19)
pokemon game (87:18 - 87:23)
so if it's a brand new game for me (87:19 - 87:25)
my ideal way to play my first (87:23 - 87:28)
playthrough is to do (87:25 - 87:31)
a try to catch everything or at least (87:28 - 87:31)
see (87:31 - 87:33)
everything that's on a route because i (87:31 - 87:35)
want to see all the new things (87:33 - 87:37)
uh and then pick and choose what's going (87:35 - 87:38)
on my team (87:37 - 87:41)
as i pass through and like oh i really (87:38 - 87:42)
like this design like (87:41 - 87:44)
you know snom came so late but i loved (87:42 - 87:45)
it so (87:44 - 87:49)
on my team uh then when i do a second (87:45 - 87:52)
playthrough because i always get both i (87:49 - 87:53)
will usually do (87:52 - 87:56)
something like a combo lock so uh (87:53 - 88:00)
combo lock is where i roll a die (87:56 - 88:02)
and depending on the number determines (88:00 - 88:04)
what action i'm going to take (88:02 - 88:05)
on that particular route and then get (88:04 - 88:07)
through the game just because (88:05 - 88:10)
i've already seen everything in the game (88:07 - 88:11)
i'm just playing through it a second (88:10 - 88:12)
time because i (88:11 - 88:15)
enjoy playing them twice uh (88:12 - 88:17)
and sort of having a different (88:15 - 88:19)
experience a second time through (88:17 - 88:23)
uh an alteration of the nuzlocke formula (88:19 - 88:25)
i i will say for my shield playthrough i (88:23 - 88:26)
am going to be playing with an (88:25 - 88:29)
entirely shiny bug team if i ever get a (88:26 - 88:32)
shiny snowman (88:29 - 88:34)
without a shiny charm because i still (88:32 - 88:36)
don't have (88:34 - 88:38)
the shield exclusives in my sword game (88:36 - 88:41)
are you misunderstood (88:38 - 88:44)
huh you method right i am breeding (88:41 - 88:46)
snomeds now yes (88:44 - 88:47)
with masuda method but i still need a (88:46 - 88:49)
shiny charm it's your ones (88:47 - 88:53)
one and six 682 i i don't know (88:49 - 88:55)
i i try to kill as many snowms as i can (88:53 - 88:56)
in my free time (88:55 - 89:00)
to bring that little number up i got a (88:56 - 89:03)
japanese ditto to breed against but (89:00 - 89:06)
no shiny charm still so i mean do you (89:03 - 89:09)
want me to help you get the (89:06 - 89:12)
the uh exclusives because i have them (89:09 - 89:14)
i have both games we've had this (89:12 - 89:16)
conversation before i know and the (89:14 - 89:18)
person that was supposed to help you (89:16 - 89:21)
bailed who that was not me (89:18 - 89:23)
i didn't say i was here it was you all (89:21 - 89:25)
right all right all right (89:23 - 89:28)
jeez mr ego you're so vain (89:25 - 89:30)
i bet you think this segment's about you (89:28 - 89:32)
wow (89:30 - 89:33)
what was that are we good with the (89:32 - 89:35)
question can we complain about nuts (89:33 - 89:37)
block police (89:35 - 89:39)
nuzlocke police there's nuzlocke police (89:37 - 89:40)
yeah this (89:39 - 89:42)
this maybe this happens because i uh (89:40 - 89:43)
because i stream on because you're a (89:42 - 89:43)
streamer (89:43 - 89:46)
yeah but okay so for example i (89:43 - 89:49)
i did a shiny badge quest omega ruby (89:46 - 89:51)
alpha sapphire i think (89:49 - 89:53)
or maybe with sun or x and y what are (89:51 - 89:55)
the games that have horde battles (89:53 - 89:57)
x and y it was x and y i think i (89:55 - 89:58)
remember this (89:57 - 90:00)
yeah yeah yeah so i was like okay we're (89:58 - 90:02)
gonna we're gonna do a shiny badge quest (90:00 - 90:03)
on x and y (90:02 - 90:06)
and but but they don't give you a (90:03 - 90:09)
pokemon with sweet scent (90:06 - 90:11)
or the opportunity to see horde battles (90:09 - 90:13)
until after the first gym (90:11 - 90:15)
it's like immediately after the first (90:13 - 90:17)
gym like once you beat viola (90:15 - 90:21)
or whatever her name is then you you (90:17 - 90:24)
you're you're dancing torino (90:21 - 90:26)
gives you sweet scent and there's gulpin (90:24 - 90:27)
and there's (90:26 - 90:29)
other pokemon and so i was like all (90:27 - 90:30)
right (90:29 - 90:33)
we're gonna do a shiny batch quest in x (90:30 - 90:34)
and y (90:33 - 90:35)
it's gonna be a big thing on twitch it's (90:34 - 90:37)
gonna be really fun but i don't want to (90:35 - 90:39)
reset first starter because i (90:37 - 90:42)
because i don't want to listen to serena (90:39 - 90:44)
call me master (90:42 - 90:48)
p or big s or whatever i wonder if i (90:44 - 90:50)
don't want to read that 4 000 times (90:48 - 90:52)
and i i don't i'm not in love with any (90:50 - 90:55)
of these starters also (90:52 - 90:57)
i would if i if i'm going to go for a (90:55 - 90:59)
shiny starter i would want to go for (90:57 - 91:00)
it's hidden ability (90:59 - 91:02)
so i can't do that when i'm soft (91:00 - 91:04)
resetting at the beginning of a game (91:02 - 91:06)
so i don't like any of this i don't like (91:04 - 91:08)
the i don't like the method i don't like (91:06 - 91:09)
lack of hidden ability i don't like (91:08 - 91:11)
being called big p (91:09 - 91:14)
i don't want anything so what (91:11 - 91:15)
we're gonna do is i'm gonna beat the (91:14 - 91:17)
first gym real quick because it takes (91:15 - 91:18)
like 10 minutes in that game to beat the (91:17 - 91:19)
first gym (91:18 - 91:21)
and then we're going to start our shiny (91:19 - 91:23)
badge quest and we'll get two shinies (91:21 - 91:24)
i should probably explain what a shiny (91:23 - 91:26)
badge quest is for anyone that doesn't (91:24 - 91:28)
know shiny badge quest is you get one (91:26 - 91:29)
shiny per (91:28 - 91:32)
gym so you can't challenge the gym (91:29 - 91:33)
leader until you get a shiny (91:32 - 91:35)
and then ideally when you get to the (91:33 - 91:37)
elite four you have eight shiny pokemon (91:35 - 91:38)
that you've gotten (91:37 - 91:40)
to represent the eight gyms and then you (91:38 - 91:42)
pick from the eight the six pokemon you (91:40 - 91:43)
want and then you go (91:42 - 91:44)
battle the elite four it's not like (91:43 - 91:47)
another sounds like a tremendous waste (91:44 - 91:48)
of effort yeah (91:47 - 91:50)
it is it's it's just like the film it's (91:48 - 91:51)
a field programming time (91:50 - 91:54)
right it's it's it's to make a game seem (91:51 - 91:56)
longer than it actually (91:54 - 92:00)
is uh but if it does it does give the (91:56 - 92:02)
the nuzlocke treatment of forcing you to (92:00 - 92:04)
be like okay well between route (92:02 - 92:06)
four and five these are my pokemon which (92:04 - 92:08)
one would be the coolest shiny before i (92:06 - 92:09)
get to clemont (92:08 - 92:10)
it does something like that just like in (92:09 - 92:12)
a nuzlocke you're like well i never (92:10 - 92:13)
thought i'm gonna use bellsprout but i (92:12 - 92:16)
guess bellsprout was my encounter so (92:13 - 92:19)
come on bellsprout we can do it (92:16 - 92:21)
so uh so we beat vila within like 10 (92:19 - 92:22)
minutes (92:21 - 92:25)
and then i get the sweet scent and there (92:22 - 92:26)
was (92:25 - 92:28)
there was some dude in chat and this (92:26 - 92:29)
happens all the time (92:28 - 92:31)
and they were they were non-stop (92:29 - 92:33)
complaining on how i was doing this (92:31 - 92:34)
wrong (92:33 - 92:36)
and they were like ah you're you didn't (92:34 - 92:38)
suffer set for a starter (92:36 - 92:40)
what that was howard just shiny badge (92:38 - 92:42)
quiz you got i'm sorry spread for the (92:40 - 92:43)
starter and it's like all right dude (92:42 - 92:44)
calm down (92:43 - 92:46)
look i could sit here and try to get a (92:44 - 92:48)
scatter bug before the gym too but i (92:46 - 92:49)
want i (92:48 - 92:51)
i really want a horde hunt i just want a (92:49 - 92:53)
sweet scent i just want to hang out with (92:51 - 92:53)
chet (92:53 - 92:55)
i want to hit the sweet set button i (92:53 - 92:57)
want to see five gulpin at a time (92:55 - 92:59)
it'll all be good buddy we're gonna get (92:57 - 93:00)
two shinies before we get to the second (92:59 - 93:02)
gym it's fine (93:00 - 93:04)
and for like an hour this dude was like (93:02 - 93:06)
ah you're playing this wrong i can't (93:04 - 93:07)
believe it you (93:06 - 93:10)
broke the fundamental shiny bad badge (93:07 - 93:10)
quest (93:10 - 93:13)
laws of the universe how dare (93:10 - 93:16)
i was like please here's the number for (93:13 - 93:17)
the shiny badge quest (93:16 - 93:20)
please police give them a call let them (93:17 - 93:21)
know where i live (93:20 - 93:25)
send them to my door and arrest me (93:21 - 93:28)
because i am taking somebody's (93:25 - 93:30)
no offense to them whoever made a shiny (93:28 - 93:32)
batch quest but i'm sure somebody (93:30 - 93:34)
in in their bedroom in their parents (93:32 - 93:36)
house that was like this is a fun way to (93:34 - 93:36)
play (93:36 - 93:38)
i'm gonna type this up and put on the (93:36 - 93:40)
internet and then somehow (93:38 - 93:44)
the laws of zekrom bound these rules (93:40 - 93:47)
to the internet and gosh forbid if you (93:44 - 93:49)
don't follow them exactly you will be in (93:47 - 93:50)
the (93:49 - 93:52)
eternal prison that is the darkness zone (93:50 - 93:53)
of (93:52 - 93:55)
the infinity zone of the darkness ablaze (93:53 - 93:57)
and you can never play a pokemon game (93:55 - 93:58)
again (93:57 - 94:01)
uh and this happens with nuzzlocks too (93:58 - 94:02)
they're (94:01 - 94:04)
maybe it's just maybe it's just twitch (94:02 - 94:05)
people come in and they're like you're (94:04 - 94:07)
doing another this way do you not know (94:05 - 94:08)
the rules (94:07 - 94:12)
you're supposed to do like guess what (94:08 - 94:15)
it is twitch no maybe about it (94:12 - 94:18)
it's like who cares like and i get that (94:15 - 94:20)
question all the time it's like (94:18 - 94:24)
oh if is it okay if i use held items in (94:20 - 94:25)
my nuzlocke (94:24 - 94:27)
yeah man it's your nose like do whatever (94:25 - 94:30)
you want it's like i found a shiny (94:27 - 94:31)
i found a shoddy in my nuzlocke but i (94:30 - 94:33)
already caught a pokemon in this rock (94:31 - 94:35)
can i catch it (94:33 - 94:38)
yes nope you gotta throw it away (94:35 - 94:40)
what what do you possibly think is gonna (94:38 - 94:43)
happen if you don't like (94:40 - 94:45)
do you think a meteorite is gonna crash (94:43 - 94:47)
through your living room if you decide (94:45 - 94:49)
that yeah oh gosh what if i break the (94:47 - 94:51)
rule here and catch the shiny (94:49 - 94:54)
who cares oh the arguments over the wild (94:51 - 94:56)
area and nuzlockes (94:54 - 94:59)
fill my soul just do whatever it does (94:56 - 95:01)
none of it matters (94:59 - 95:05)
i mean you're not wrong (95:01 - 95:07)
i think it not gonna be good to do that (95:05 - 95:08)
jokingly (95:07 - 95:11)
uh i mean so when we run up to the thing (95:08 - 95:15)
of i think it should be this way why are (95:11 - 95:17)
you not doing it my way (95:15 - 95:19)
like that is just a human condition of (95:17 - 95:21)
they have an expectation that's not (95:19 - 95:22)
being met (95:21 - 95:26)
uh lower your expectations people just (95:22 - 95:28)
get just it's not that big of a deal (95:26 - 95:30)
yeah so normally when i learn from gen x (95:28 - 95:33)
lower your expectations exactly (95:30 - 95:36)
normally when i do nuzlockes i will i (95:33 - 95:37)
will like put a level cap (95:36 - 95:39)
on so i'll be like somebody look up what (95:37 - 95:41)
blaine's level is and somebody'll be (95:39 - 95:43)
like blaine's pony plane's (95:41 - 95:45)
ponyta is like 42. i was like okay cool (95:43 - 95:47)
the level kept 42 then (95:45 - 95:50)
and so i was like i would get questions (95:47 - 95:52)
of like why do you have a level cap well (95:50 - 95:54)
it's like it's to make it harder (95:52 - 95:56)
yeah and then i'll like limit myself for (95:54 - 95:58)
like items and battles because i think (95:56 - 95:59)
that makes it harder too (95:58 - 96:01)
because a lot of times i'll see people (95:59 - 96:03)
be like and (96:01 - 96:05)
that's fine i mean if they want to do it (96:03 - 96:06)
that way that's totally cool but i'll (96:05 - 96:06)
see (96:06 - 96:09)
somebody like battling bruno and bruno (96:06 - 96:10)
uses earthquake (96:09 - 96:12)
and their pokemon has like one hp and (96:10 - 96:14)
then they potion they use a hyper potion (96:12 - 96:15)
and then bruno uses earthquake again and (96:14 - 96:17)
they're back at one hp so they use a (96:15 - 96:18)
hyper potion (96:17 - 96:20)
and then bruno uses earthquake again and (96:18 - 96:21)
they repeat this for 10 times and all of (96:20 - 96:22)
a sudden (96:21 - 96:24)
earth bruno uses bind and they're like (96:22 - 96:25)
oh finally i can (96:24 - 96:28)
i can now attack and it's like well yeah (96:25 - 96:31)
i mean you just used 10 hyper potions to (96:28 - 96:33)
wait until he was out of earthquakes and (96:31 - 96:35)
now now you're in a safe zone (96:33 - 96:37)
um and if that's how you want to play (96:35 - 96:39)
that's totally cool i just don't think (96:37 - 96:40)
that's personally fun i think potion (96:39 - 96:41)
stalling is (96:40 - 96:44)
is is really kind of cheap (96:41 - 96:46)
and so i try to limit myself with three (96:44 - 96:48)
items (96:46 - 96:52)
uh 2021 but i would i would never going (96:48 - 96:53)
to twitch streamers (96:52 - 96:56)
uh you're potion stalling i can't (96:53 - 96:57)
believe you're ruining nuzlocke this way (96:56 - 96:59)
i can't believe that your potion's (96:57 - 97:00)
telling that's not the rules of a (96:59 - 97:02)
nuzlocke (97:00 - 97:03)
you're gonna get banned from another (97:02 - 97:05)
stream but so (97:03 - 97:07)
so i put that rule on so now then so (97:05 - 97:09)
when people see me play they're like oh (97:07 - 97:09)
well (97:09 - 97:12)
should should i put a potion limit on (97:09 - 97:13)
it's like (97:12 - 97:16)
no you should do whatever you think (97:13 - 97:21)
makes it fun for you if you (97:16 - 97:24)
if it if you not using items makes your (97:21 - 97:25)
experience (97:24 - 97:28)
less fun then don't put that rule on (97:25 - 97:29)
yourself (97:28 - 97:31)
if if putting a level cap on your (97:29 - 97:32)
pokemon makes it (97:31 - 97:36)
less fun then don't do that (97:32 - 97:39)
um so whatever works i don't know but (97:36 - 97:39)
the (97:39 - 97:41)
the people who are the nuzlocke police (97:39 - 97:43)
are are (97:41 - 97:45)
are the worst (97:43 - 97:45)
people who are the police of any silly (97:46 - 97:51)
thing (97:49 - 97:55)
are not great well 10 years (97:51 - 97:57)
oh boy i have not been doing pokemon of (97:55 - 97:58)
the week for 10 years i've only been (97:57 - 98:01)
doing it since february 14 (97:58 - 98:03)
2012. (98:01 - 98:05)
which i was going to do a throwback but (98:03 - 98:06)
because i'm sick (98:05 - 98:08)
we're not we're not throwing anything (98:06 - 98:10)
back i'll throw you back to (98:08 - 98:11)
technically last week even though it was (98:10 - 98:13)
a week and a half ago (98:11 - 98:15)
never should have been animated in the (98:13 - 98:17)
overworld it just kind of hops around (98:15 - 98:20)
it even though it is not a bug type it (98:17 - 98:21)
had its naming convention (98:20 - 98:25)
is based on bug uh thingamajiggers (98:21 - 98:30)
and what's the word for it i don't know (98:25 - 98:33)
no like larvae just (98:30 - 98:36)
terminology that we rever refer to (98:33 - 98:40)
bug growth cycles whatever (98:36 - 98:44)
um and it uh (98:40 - 98:47)
uh it can learn dark type moves before (98:44 - 98:48)
it evolves to its final form but it (98:47 - 98:50)
doesn't get stabbed from dark type moves (98:48 - 98:52)
until it's in its final form but when (98:50 - 98:54)
it's in its final form it loses (98:52 - 98:57)
stab from uh ground type moves such as (98:54 - 98:59)
earthquake (98:57 - 99:03)
so what you got for me kids (98:59 - 99:06)
it's (99:03 - 99:08)
pancham (99:06 - 99:08)
it's pupitar poopitar (99:11 - 99:18)
yes larvae pupae (99:14 - 99:23)
and tar tyranny (99:18 - 99:23)
there's no such thing as tyrae but (99:24 - 99:27)
larvae and pupae are (99:26 - 99:32)
um refer to insect growth periods (99:27 - 99:35)
yes it is it is pupitar um (99:32 - 99:37)
i don't know why they bothered to (99:35 - 99:38)
animate it the way that they did in the (99:37 - 99:39)
overworld (99:38 - 99:42)
it is absolutely horrifying it looks so (99:39 - 99:43)
incredibly sad (99:42 - 99:45)
following you around hopping on its one (99:43 - 99:46)
little point (99:45 - 99:48)
with the only expression coming from its (99:46 - 99:50)
eyes which are hidden (99:48 - 99:53)
inside of that shell (99:50 - 99:53)
but i finally evolved it to tyranitar (99:53 - 99:57)
and then i put it away (99:56 - 100:01)
yeah i have a little um uh what's my (99:57 - 100:04)
little firebug dude (100:01 - 100:07)
no you are so bad at pokemon of the week (100:04 - 100:10)

so sizzle peed yes i got a little (100:14 - 100:20)
sizzlip follow me around it's real cute (100:16 - 100:24)
pupitar is based on (100:20 - 100:24)
yeah i think we've established that (100:24 - 100:27)
already that's that's the origin in the (100:25 - 100:29)
trivia (100:27 - 100:30)
that's it not a lot going for this (100:29 - 100:33)
pokemon you think anyone that (100:30 - 100:38)
this is their favorite pokemon yes yeah (100:33 - 100:41)
look i'm continually surprised that the (100:38 - 100:42)
amount of people who come out of the (100:41 - 100:43)
woodwork to defend (100:42 - 100:46)
everything but still [ __ ] and catskill (100:43 - 100:47)
no there's no way (100:46 - 100:49)
the people that would the people that (100:47 - 100:50)
would say that this is their favorite (100:49 - 100:53)
pokemon over tyranitar or larvatar (100:50 - 100:54)
both significantly better pokemon (100:53 - 100:56)
they're they're like the (100:54 - 101:00)
the cassette listeners of 2020. (100:56 - 101:03)
they're like they're nesters they're (101:00 - 101:04)
like i'm gonna say (101:03 - 101:06)
pupitar because no one else is gonna say (101:04 - 101:08)
pupitar even though like deep down they (101:06 - 101:10)
know tyranitar and larvitar are both (101:08 - 101:13)
significantly better (101:10 - 101:13)

we'll give us our for next week this (101:53 - 101:57)
okay so (101:56 - 101:58)
i was going to try harder but i'm i'm (101:57 - 102:00)
just really not feeling well so you get (101:58 - 102:01)
what you get (102:00 - 102:04)
after a 15-year hiatus i have decided to (102:01 - 102:06)
return to one of the hobbies that i have (102:04 - 102:07)
most enjoyed in life (102:06 - 102:10)
playing guitar in the early 2000s (102:07 - 102:13)
i purchased a yamaha folk guitar and (102:10 - 102:15)
took lessons for a year or two (102:13 - 102:16)
i have been quite surprised to discover (102:15 - 102:18)
that even after all of these years have (102:16 - 102:19)
passed (102:18 - 102:21)
i am still able to read sheet music and (102:19 - 102:23)
play notes quite well (102:21 - 102:25)
when i first started studying guitar i (102:23 - 102:27)
studied classical style (102:25 - 102:29)
which is not impossible but is also not (102:27 - 102:30)
simple to do on a folk (102:29 - 102:33)
guitar partially because of this i do (102:30 - 102:34)
not read tablature (102:33 - 102:36)
and never learned any of today's pop (102:34 - 102:37)
hits (102:36 - 102:39)
i still enjoy playing classical guitar (102:37 - 102:41)
as i find finger picking to be quite (102:39 - 102:43)
rewarding (102:41 - 102:45)
you may or may not be aware but in the (102:43 - 102:47)
unova games there are musicians (102:45 - 102:49)
scattered throughout the region (102:47 - 102:51)
if you interact with them their (102:49 - 102:53)
instrument may become part of the game's (102:51 - 102:56)
soundtrack in black and white 2 (102:53 - 102:59)
there is a small puzzle to unlock the (102:56 - 103:00)
piano track (102:59 - 103:03)
in a cumulator in the northeast corner (103:00 - 103:04)
of the town (103:03 - 103:07)
a pianist and a drummer are together in (103:04 - 103:08)
a house (103:07 - 103:11)
they request to view two pokemon one (103:08 - 103:12)
being wismer (103:11 - 103:15)
this week's pokemon is the other one (103:12 - 103:16)
they wish (103:15 - 103:20)
to see unfortunately you cannot obtain (103:16 - 103:22)
the pokemon they ask for in black and (103:20 - 103:24)
white 2. (103:22 - 103:26)
you can obtain its evolution in black (103:24 - 103:27)
and white (103:26 - 103:30)
if you hunt diligently in the dream yard (103:27 - 103:32)
but then you will have to breed it to (103:30 - 103:33)
obtain the smaller (103:32 - 103:36)
small tater that they are looking for (103:33 - 103:38)
