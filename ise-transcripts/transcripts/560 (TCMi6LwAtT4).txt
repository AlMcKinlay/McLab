560th episode of the Pokemon Puck I (0:25 - 0:30)
think it's yeah 60th episode of the (0:28 - 0:33)
Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm (0:30 - 0:36)
your host Steve with me is a Greg (0:33 - 0:40)
hello happy eggs I had eggs yesterday (0:36 - 0:44)
and I had eggs today they may or may not (0:40 - 0:46)
have been colored no comment on that but (0:44 - 0:48)
I have eaten eggs for two days straight (0:46 - 0:52)
uh with the Reese's eggs (0:48 - 0:52)
I've had (0:55 - 1:00)
uh I so the worst thing I discovered is (0:57 - 1:02)
KitKat put out an Easter lemon flavor (1:00 - 1:03)
because lemon is my favorite flavor and (1:02 - 1:06)
the entire bag and like one sitting and (1:03 - 1:06)
then (1:06 - 1:11)
no longer existed with lemon in it (1:06 - 1:13)
the shell the candy shell around the (1:11 - 1:15)
KitKat um (1:13 - 1:18)
yeah Hannah's also here Hannah (1:15 - 1:20)
I am here the only the only eggs in my (1:18 - 1:23)
world have been the original eggs in (1:20 - 1:27)
rates today that's it well I guess we (1:23 - 1:30)
can start off talking about that (1:27 - 1:32)
um we have a little bit of Pokemon why (1:30 - 1:35)
why Easter when the day before Easter (1:32 - 1:39)
existed and it was still a weekend (1:35 - 1:42)
uh uh we have some news about that we (1:39 - 1:44)
have some news about Monster Energy (1:42 - 1:45)
which isn't really newsworthy I just (1:44 - 1:47)
think it's more funny than anything (1:45 - 1:51)
um and then we have some changes I guess (1:47 - 1:55)
with like creatures ah you know it's a (1:51 - 1:57)
weird Newsweek it's a holiday for some (1:55 - 1:58)
people (1:57 - 2:00)
speaking of holidays we're recording (1:58 - 2:02)
this on Easter uh and for whatever (2:00 - 2:06)
reason and who knows Niantic decided to (2:02 - 2:09)
put uh Reggie alecky (2:06 - 2:14)
um Elite raids on Easter day uh which is (2:09 - 2:17)
April 9th I think Easter is always the (2:14 - 2:19)
first Sunday of April is that how it (2:17 - 2:20)
works (2:19 - 2:23)
oh it's the it's something it's it's (2:20 - 2:26)
awesome it is a second Sunday four weeks (2:23 - 2:29)
after a certain thing and because it can (2:26 - 2:32)
be in March Sometimes in April I don't (2:29 - 2:33)
know the rules for the ever-changing (2:32 - 2:37)
holiday that is Easter look I could look (2:33 - 2:39)
it up the bunny hat the bunny is not (2:37 - 2:41)
like Santa Claus very complicated (2:39 - 2:45)
schedule here no um okay so we'll we'll (2:41 - 2:47)
try to keep the the Pokemon go Section a (2:45 - 2:49)
little shorter here (2:47 - 2:51)
um look this season is Is Not Great (2:49 - 2:53)
still pretty boring there's like a (2:51 - 2:55)
Lapras event coming out which is just (2:53 - 2:56)
Lapras for whatever (2:55 - 3:00)
and just once you only get one you get (2:56 - 3:02)
one single Lapras (3:00 - 3:05)
the wild Lapras that is coming to unite (3:02 - 3:08)
if you have not got on Twitter to watch (3:05 - 3:10)
the videos which I have tried to explain (3:08 - 3:13)
to people a Pokemon jumping on lapras's (3:10 - 3:15)
back and zooming around the map you need (3:13 - 3:17)
to go find it and watch it because it is (3:15 - 3:21)
Goofy it'll make you laugh and it looks (3:17 - 3:23)
real fun (3:21 - 3:25)
um (3:23 - 3:25)
I uh we all went out for originality (3:26 - 3:31)
except for Greg Greg was doing egg stuff (3:30 - 3:35)
yeah I I had egg stuff (3:31 - 3:38)
and then I came home and I said huh I'm (3:35 - 3:42)
gonna nap and I did and I enjoyed my (3:38 - 3:44)
life choices and I said look at all (3:42 - 3:46)
these people getting original key uh uh (3:44 - 3:50)
in direct Defiance of an official (3:46 - 3:54)
also weird many holidays generally I can (3:50 - 3:57)
be like well that's only a holiday (3:54 - 4:00)
in X in place America this is like (3:57 - 4:03)
worldwide right like Easter's a big (4:00 - 4:06)
thing to a lot of people does Japan (4:03 - 4:09)
celebrate Easter I don't think there are (4:06 - 4:11)
always a lot of yeah products like (4:09 - 4:14)
Pokemon Easter themed products I'm not (4:11 - 4:16)
sure celebrating is necessarily the (4:14 - 4:18)
right one yeah but there are a lot I (4:16 - 4:19)
mean there's a lot Japan definitely has (4:18 - 4:21)
a lot of fake churches because they like (4:19 - 4:23)
the American Wedding but without the (4:21 - 4:25)
religious aspect of it I've been told (4:23 - 4:28)
that by many by our Japanese (4:25 - 4:30)
correspondent Andrew who pointed out (4:28 - 4:32)
yeah these churches are all just to get (4:30 - 4:34)
married not actually for religious (4:32 - 4:36)
purposes (4:34 - 4:40)
yeah I mean if you're a Christian in (4:36 - 4:43)
Japan yes you celebrate Easter if you're (4:40 - 4:45)
gonna look KFC with that who knows you (4:43 - 4:47)
know KFC around Christmas time too (4:45 - 4:50)
uh Hannah what was your experience (4:47 - 4:53)
getting regular key on uh on this (4:50 - 4:56)
holiday of sorts (4:53 - 4:59)
my local groups I don't think even (4:56 - 5:02)
really tried to do the 11 A.M which (4:59 - 5:05)
means I'm really grateful they rebalance (5:02 - 5:07)
things since last time with Reggie Drago (5:05 - 5:09)
it was very weighted towards almost (5:07 - 5:12)
every right around here was 11 A.M this (5:09 - 5:14)
time it's a whole lot more balanced (5:12 - 5:15)
there are a whole lot more 2PM and a (5:14 - 5:18)
whole lot more 5 p.m raids uh I think (5:15 - 5:20)
everybody just skipped the 11AM for the (5:18 - 5:22)
most part I don't know if anybody went (5:20 - 5:24)
to that one but then when we had the 2PM (5:22 - 5:25)
one (5:24 - 5:29)
there were maybe 25 people there it was (5:25 - 5:31)
pretty much our whole local group but (5:29 - 5:33)
also I live in the least one of the (5:31 - 5:37)
least religious cities in the country so (5:33 - 5:40)
that might play a factor (5:37 - 5:42)
I went to the same place I went last (5:40 - 5:45)
time Centennial Centennial Lakes there (5:42 - 5:48)
were no 11s at all in Centennial Lakes (5:45 - 5:50)
uh yeah well I'm gonna say this (5:48 - 5:53)
at the suburbs (5:50 - 5:55)
Easter services are generally starting (5:53 - 5:59)
at 10 30. or they do two but they have (5:55 - 6:01)
particularly big (5:59 - 6:03)
congregations they'll do one at nine a.m (6:01 - 6:05)
and then one at 11 A.M (6:03 - 6:07)
the home morning is going to be empty (6:05 - 6:10)
like yeah I don't people have to do (6:07 - 6:12)
brunch people have to go over to places (6:10 - 6:16)
generally in this area meaning Minnesota (6:12 - 6:19)
Easter morning is a thing and nothing (6:16 - 6:20)
happens yeah so I don't know if that was (6:19 - 6:22)
intentional I did see Rumblings online (6:20 - 6:25)
that the same thing you said Hannah that (6:22 - 6:28)
there was not a lot of elevens there (6:25 - 6:31)
were two 11s for Drago uh when I went (6:28 - 6:33)
originally and there were no 11s there (6:31 - 6:35)
was a two (6:33 - 6:37)
so I was like well I'm just going to (6:35 - 6:39)
show up to the two because I see at (6:37 - 6:40)
least two other people are showing up (6:39 - 6:43)
and I don't know it's a pretty popular (6:40 - 6:46)
part I only need three people yeah it's (6:43 - 6:48)
also like a pretty popular Park so I I (6:46 - 6:50)
expected people to be there regardless (6:48 - 6:53)
and there were that Park was jam-packed (6:50 - 6:54)
um (6:53 - 6:56)
which like part of me like look I think (6:54 - 6:58)
having this event on a holiday is really (6:56 - 7:00)
silly especially since the day before (6:58 - 7:02)
was not a holiday (7:00 - 7:06)
uh but if Niantic I don't know maybe (7:02 - 7:07)
we're giving them too much credit if (7:06 - 7:09)
they thought to themselves well a lot of (7:07 - 7:12)
people are going to be in parks and (7:09 - 7:14)
therefore maybe that would convince like (7:12 - 7:17)
hey Grandma remember when you played (7:14 - 7:20)
Pokemon go two days ago or two years ago (7:17 - 7:23)
let's there's an event here that's (7:20 - 7:26)
happening that we can jump into (7:23 - 7:26)
why would they have it on the holiday (7:32 - 7:36)
for family what are you doing on Easter (7:34 - 7:38)
you're doing nothing you're going to (7:36 - 7:39)
church and then you're taking a nap (7:38 - 7:40)
you're not doing anything it's the same (7:39 - 7:42)
people that are like I need to be with (7:40 - 7:43)
my family on Thanksgiving no you know (7:42 - 7:45)
what my Thanksgiving has been for 29 (7:43 - 7:48)
years going there some family and law (7:45 - 7:50)
member taking control of the TV and (7:48 - 7:52)
putting on football and it's half the (7:50 - 7:54)
audience is sitting there watching (7:52 - 7:56)
boring football sorry to people who like (7:54 - 7:57)
football I know you like it I don't but (7:56 - 8:00)
like every single Thanksgiving is (7:57 - 8:03)
football half which is a half the (8:00 - 8:04)
audience and the other half of audience (8:03 - 8:06)
or family is in the kitchen like (8:04 - 8:08)
gossiping about and something I don't (8:06 - 8:10)
care about like they're (8:08 - 8:12)
I ain't doing anything at a Holiday (8:10 - 8:16)
correct holiday that is that is like if (8:12 - 8:18)
I want to do a holiday hang out with (8:16 - 8:19)
your friends I don't want to do football (8:18 - 8:22)
I would like to go out with my people I (8:19 - 8:23)
care about my family and friends and do (8:22 - 8:25)
Pokemon go that sounds way better than (8:23 - 8:26)
sitting on a couch and watching football (8:25 - 8:29)
all day like look I didn't live under a (8:26 - 8:33)
rock it's been 34 years of Easter I have (8:29 - 8:35)
never done anything that wasn't like we (8:33 - 8:37)
went to church like five times out of (8:35 - 8:38)
like (8:37 - 8:39)
in my childhood and then we came home (8:38 - 8:42)
and then we did nothing like (8:39 - 8:44)
never did an Easter egg hunt (8:42 - 8:46)
those are the best yeah those that (8:44 - 8:48)
happen in a park (8:46 - 8:50)
not not in this city they don't it's too (8:48 - 8:53)
rainy here (8:50 - 8:58)
no they're it like this year today it (8:53 - 9:00)
was it's in the uh it almost hit 70 (8:58 - 9:02)
today which is super rare a lot of the (9:00 - 9:04)
times because it can happen in March or (9:02 - 9:05)
April (9:04 - 9:08)
it is hey kids do you want to go dig (9:05 - 9:10)
around in the snow no we're all sick of (9:08 - 9:13)
this yeah let's do it somewhere else how (9:10 - 9:14)
about we just sit inside because it is (9:13 - 9:17)
literally hidden around your house my (9:14 - 9:19)
cousins tried to do a snow hunt (9:17 - 9:20)
there were (9:19 - 9:24)
20 eggs unaccounted for oh no until (9:20 - 9:27)
three months later when you could smell (9:24 - 9:28)
them (9:27 - 9:30)
because you couldn't find them because (9:28 - 9:31)
why they buried them the night before (9:30 - 9:35)
what happened it snowed that sounds (9:31 - 9:39)
great I I when I did I I didn't get to (9:35 - 9:42)
do Easter hunt egg hunts as a kid but (9:39 - 9:44)
there were parks in Milwaukee that had (9:42 - 9:48)
them and I was always too old but (9:44 - 9:50)
yeah they were at parks you have to be (9:48 - 9:52)
like a certain age it was like free if (9:50 - 9:54)
you were like I don't know between like (9:52 - 9:56)
three years old and nine years old or (9:54 - 9:57)
something but by the time my parents (9:56 - 9:59)
discovered it I was already like 11 or (9:57 - 10:00)
12. (9:59 - 10:02)
um I think Como does an Easter eggs but (10:00 - 10:05)
no what Centennial Lakes was packed (10:02 - 10:07)
there were people doing picnics there (10:05 - 10:09)
were people like sitting in the benches (10:07 - 10:11)
there were there were a lot of uh (10:09 - 10:14)
couples holding hands uh there and I (10:11 - 10:16)
didn't talk to a single person and 20 (10:14 - 10:18)
some people showed up for the raid there (10:16 - 10:20)
was only like four people in campfire (10:18 - 10:22)
saying they were doing it (10:20 - 10:25)
I think there is a small small chance of (10:22 - 10:26)
like (10:25 - 10:28)
well when are people going to be at (10:26 - 10:29)
parks oh probably on a holiday because (10:28 - 10:30)
like what else are you gonna do besides (10:29 - 10:33)
sit at home or like let's go to a park (10:30 - 10:35)
and have a grill out or something I (10:33 - 10:36)
still don't think that's good like why (10:35 - 10:38)
just have it the day before what's the (10:36 - 10:41)
like why why was it just not on Saturday (10:38 - 10:43)
this is just my rant of I've always had (10:41 - 10:44)
very bad holidays and there's nothing to (10:43 - 10:46)
do on holidays besides watch like sports (10:44 - 10:49)
or the other thing about Minnesota is (10:46 - 10:52)
this is the first warm weekend and (10:49 - 10:54)
literally everybody's swarming oh yeah (10:52 - 10:56)
Niantic planned this yeah (10:54 - 10:59)
we could finally be outside that effect (10:56 - 11:02)
is not in a big way I think that on (10:59 - 11:04)
holidays (11:02 - 11:07)
go ahead I think that on holidays It's (11:04 - 11:09)
tricky to get people together because (11:07 - 11:11)
everybody's plans are at different times (11:09 - 11:14)
so it's helpful to have a Pokemon go (11:11 - 11:19)
thing to do that is more Solo or even in (11:14 - 11:21)
small I mean I guess you only needed (11:19 - 11:22)
three people for this raid so it could (11:21 - 11:24)
have been very small but more solo for (11:22 - 11:27)
opposite though like okay again I don't (11:24 - 11:28)
think Niantic planned this because I (11:27 - 11:30)
think that's giving them two I know that (11:28 - 11:31)
they're trying to get people yeah I (11:30 - 11:32)
think that's giving them but I think (11:31 - 11:34)
that's harder to do on a holiday I think (11:32 - 11:36)
I think like maybe if we put it on a (11:34 - 11:37)
holiday we get more people to do it (11:36 - 11:40)
because they're together but like (11:37 - 11:43)
isn't that like theoretically the goal (11:40 - 11:45)
like if like let's say like I'm with my (11:43 - 11:48)
family gosh forbid I'm not but let's say (11:45 - 11:49)
I'm back in Milwaukee and it's my mom (11:48 - 11:51)
who does Play Pogo my dad who doesn't (11:49 - 11:54)
even know how to work a phone and then (11:51 - 11:56)
um my siblings who have all played (11:54 - 12:00)
Pokemon go at some point in their like (11:56 - 12:02)
they've all installed it I know that for (12:00 - 12:04)
sure like everyone Under the Sun hasn't (12:02 - 12:06)
like installed it back in 2016 and they (12:04 - 12:09)
were chasing dratinis back before raids (12:06 - 12:11)
were even a thing but if we were all (12:09 - 12:12)
sitting there (12:11 - 12:14)
and I don't know what sport is on right (12:12 - 12:16)
now it's not football like baseball (12:14 - 12:19)
college football NASCAR I don't know (12:16 - 12:21)
some whatever look who you're talking (12:19 - 12:23)
you're asking the wrong people look look (12:21 - 12:25)
at the camera and look at the people you (12:23 - 12:28)
are speaking with no clue like I am on a (12:25 - 12:30)
list looking at how many non-religious (12:28 - 12:32)
Easter egg hunts there were in Minnesota (12:30 - 12:34)
and you know what I'm fighting most of (12:32 - 12:36)
them were yesterday yeah (12:34 - 12:39)
um but like if their goal was like well (12:36 - 12:40)
all families are going to be together (12:39 - 12:42)
and it's going to be like hey there's a (12:40 - 12:44)
regular key at the park down the street (12:42 - 12:46)
let's go take a walk and do it (12:44 - 12:48)
I think there's a like a tiny bit of (12:46 - 12:50)
validity to that (12:48 - 12:52)
and I would be that person most of those (12:50 - 12:54)
people are going to be lower levels so (12:52 - 12:56)
you would need more people than a family (12:54 - 12:58)
has (12:56 - 13:02)
most of the time to finish defending (12:58 - 13:04)
there was a weekend before this there's (13:02 - 13:07)
a weekend after this very confusing they (13:04 - 13:10)
did it here uh but when I did I was okay (13:07 - 13:12)
with regular key because I I personally (13:10 - 13:15)
have bad holiday memories so this is one (13:12 - 13:17)
of the best Easters I had I got to catch (13:15 - 13:20)
one of my favorite Pokemon (13:17 - 13:20)
he's a good boy (13:21 - 13:25)
um (13:24 - 13:28)
yeah the the other problem here uh (13:25 - 13:32)
non-holiday aside was uh it broke for (13:28 - 13:34)
New Zealand again (13:32 - 13:36)
how (13:34 - 13:39)
I I don't I think I think I have I think (13:36 - 13:42)
I have thought about this more because I (13:39 - 13:43)
actually (13:42 - 13:44)
because (13:43 - 13:45)
um (13:44 - 13:47)
this this makes sense now bear with me (13:45 - 13:49)
this is a 10 this is a tin foil hat (13:47 - 13:51)
Theory though (13:49 - 13:54)
with the amount that the raid passes (13:51 - 13:57)
have gone up right so it's double the (13:54 - 13:59)
amount of remote in (13:57 - 14:03)
um which I I they did it by the way they (13:59 - 14:06)
there was like a Heroes Niantic thing (14:03 - 14:09)
Niantic (14:06 - 14:09)
there was a Heroes Niantic too yeah if (14:09 - 14:14)
not what I'm not sure what happens I'm (14:11 - 14:16)
I'm only gonna get in when we get up to (14:14 - 14:17)
sequel number five because that's what (14:16 - 14:19)
it's like really weird and that's what I (14:17 - 14:21)
meant I might have missed the jump of (14:19 - 14:23)
why there was Heroes 962 (14:21 - 14:24)
um (14:23 - 14:26)
they went ahead and they they limited (14:24 - 14:28)
the roommate remote raid passes and then (14:26 - 14:29)
they (14:28 - 14:33)
um increase the price right so (14:29 - 14:35)
that happened I think on April 6th they (14:33 - 14:37)
said they were going to they did it most (14:35 - 14:39)
of their Twitter has been the standard (14:37 - 14:41)
we've already scheduled these posts out (14:39 - 14:44)
there hasn't been really anything else (14:41 - 14:47)
but because of that (14:44 - 14:50)
I have seen that people were like well I (14:47 - 14:52)
am just going to (14:50 - 14:54)
resort to spoofing (14:52 - 14:56)
which is you know that that's been uh (14:54 - 14:59)
that's been an ongoing issue for forever (14:56 - 15:01)
and I would never do it I would also (14:59 - 15:03)
never have two Pokemon go accounts (15:01 - 15:04)
because that would be two opportunities (15:03 - 15:07)
to give Niantic money and I ain't fallen (15:04 - 15:10)
for That Trick (15:07 - 15:10)
I know what would happen I would be like (15:10 - 15:15)
oh but if I spend a dollar on my other (15:12 - 15:17)
one account has it then the other one (15:15 - 15:19)
has to happen like if I'm spending 20 (15:17 - 15:21)
here maybe I'll spend 20 no I'm not (15:19 - 15:23)
falling for that trick but I think (15:21 - 15:25)
why New Zealand keeps getting screwed (15:23 - 15:29)
over is because I I would assume that (15:25 - 15:30)
all the spoofers are going there first (15:29 - 15:33)
because that is the first event of the (15:30 - 15:37)
entire thing so you know when when uh (15:33 - 15:39)
Rayquaza comes back you can either wait (15:37 - 15:41)
theoretically the next day what is it (15:39 - 15:44)
like 14 hours later until it appears in (15:41 - 15:46)
your time zone or you can just spoof to (15:44 - 15:49)
New Zealand and all meet your other (15:46 - 15:52)
spoofer friends there and then just do (15:49 - 15:55)
it and if it did sound like a big part (15:52 - 15:57)
of this problem this time around was the (15:55 - 15:59)
spoofers so if (15:57 - 16:01)
if New Zealand keeps breaking and people (15:59 - 16:03)
are like Niantic how could how does this (16:01 - 16:04)
keep happening (16:03 - 16:07)
is it not also all the spoofers are (16:04 - 16:09)
going there every time there's a new (16:07 - 16:10)
Pokemon every time there's a new event (16:09 - 16:12)
every time there's a new shiny like (16:10 - 16:14)
there is nowhere else for them to go (16:12 - 16:17)
because they are the first time zone and (16:14 - 16:20)
like the the takeaway here is spoofers (16:17 - 16:24)
are going to spoof right like like yeah (16:20 - 16:27)
like they they don't care where in the (16:24 - 16:29)
world it is they just want it (16:27 - 16:34)
and what 11 A.M Reggie Ellie key time is (16:29 - 16:37)
what like 6 6 p.m are like America time (16:34 - 16:40)
so it's it's like a pretty reasonable (16:37 - 16:42)
it's not like they're they're waking up (16:40 - 16:45)
at 2AM to do it (16:42 - 16:47)
that's what I think at least that now (16:45 - 16:51)
that's not too again this in no way I am (16:47 - 16:53)
defending Niantic but (16:51 - 16:54)
laughs (16:53 - 16:56)
I don't know how Niantic fixes that (16:54 - 16:58)
problem without (16:56 - 17:01)
but well they Amplified it do we think (16:58 - 17:04)
there are that many spoofers that a (17:01 - 17:08)
million percent crash their game (17:04 - 17:08)
yes I do (17:08 - 17:14)
because think of the size of New Zealand (17:11 - 17:17)
it's not very big (17:14 - 17:19)
so if Niantic has anti-cheats to be like (17:17 - 17:22)
there is no way that (17:19 - 17:25)
40 000 people should be at this single (17:22 - 17:26)
Park (17:25 - 17:29)
trying to activate this gym they can (17:26 - 17:31)
then narrow down that well these are (17:29 - 17:34)
obviously people spoofing right like (17:31 - 17:37)
they might they they must have caps on (17:34 - 17:40)
gyms to know how many people are doing (17:37 - 17:42)
it to then narrow down and point out (17:40 - 17:44)
like (17:42 - 17:45)
well I guess probably mostly for ads (17:44 - 17:48)
right like we know that ten thousand (17:45 - 17:50)
people are spinning this gym every day (17:48 - 17:52)
versus that gym in the middle of nowhere (17:50 - 17:54)
we're only like 5 000 people are (17:52 - 17:56)
spinning like they they have to know the (17:54 - 17:59)
capacity of every gym (17:56 - 18:01)
so because New Zealand isn't a very big (17:59 - 18:03)
city and because it is the only country (18:01 - 18:05)
that's in that or sorry it's not very (18:03 - 18:08)
big country because that country is in (18:05 - 18:09)
its own time zone (18:08 - 18:12)
because Japan is I think all of Japan is (18:09 - 18:14)
an hour later (18:12 - 18:15)
right (18:14 - 18:17)
that's like New Zealand then it's Japan (18:15 - 18:20)
slash some of Australia and then it's (18:17 - 18:22)
like the rest of Australia they're all (18:20 - 18:24)
going to and a bunch they're all going (18:22 - 18:26)
to go right to New Zealand (18:24 - 18:28)
like we don't hear this issue with Japan (18:26 - 18:31)
right like we don't hear (18:28 - 18:34)
oh Japan's Community or whatever went (18:31 - 18:36)
broke broken we always hear about New (18:34 - 18:41)
Zealand because it's the first one to go (18:36 - 18:43)
there also might be a language (18:41 - 18:44)
or you're there but (18:43 - 18:46)
but it's true we don't usually hear (18:44 - 18:48)
about we would hear about it if Japan's (18:46 - 18:50)
were more broken well Japan is what like (18:48 - 18:52)
the second biggest Money Maker behind (18:50 - 18:55)
America yeah New Zealand's are always (18:52 - 18:56)
really broken (18:55 - 18:58)
laughs (18:56 - 19:00)
just always and it did sound like at (18:58 - 19:02)
least what I heard was this time around (19:00 - 19:04)
it was that the raids capped out because (19:02 - 19:06)
there were so many people spoofing in (19:04 - 19:08)
and then people who were actually there (19:06 - 19:10)
weren't able to get into the Reggio (19:08 - 19:11)
accurades (19:10 - 19:13)
oh yeah yeah (19:11 - 19:15)
which sucks for those people like again (19:13 - 19:17)
this is no this is no way in defending (19:15 - 19:19)
Niantic this is like (19:17 - 19:21)
how do they fix this (19:19 - 19:25)
like if if I think the the future (19:21 - 19:27)
scenario is (19:25 - 19:29)
that (19:27 - 19:32)
we don't get any new features to this (19:29 - 19:34)
game because because the remote raid (19:32 - 19:36)
passes have won gone up and because (19:34 - 19:38)
there's a limit of five (19:36 - 19:41)
those people that are addicted to this (19:38 - 19:44)
game will just resort to spoofing and (19:41 - 19:46)
Niantic will now have to put their (19:44 - 19:48)
energy into fixing that instead of (19:46 - 19:51)
fixing the game it's like it's a (19:48 - 19:53)
lose-lose for everyone honestly because (19:51 - 19:55)
like we we can come on the show and be (19:53 - 19:56)
like Oh my game crashed like three times (19:55 - 20:00)
or like oh like I try to remote raid (19:56 - 20:02)
and I it kicked me out and then I lost (20:00 - 20:04)
my RAID pass like (20:02 - 20:07)
I want Niantic to fix those issues to (20:04 - 20:09)
make the game better but I'm now worried (20:07 - 20:12)
that the future of this game is (20:09 - 20:15)
the people who are desperately addicted (20:12 - 20:17)
to this game (20:15 - 20:20)
and want to do as many raids as possible (20:17 - 20:22)
they are going to resort to spoofing and (20:20 - 20:23)
we're going to see more and more of (20:22 - 20:25)
these issues of places getting (20:23 - 20:27)
overwhelmed especially if it's an event (20:25 - 20:31)
so like (20:27 - 20:31)
what happens when there's you know (20:31 - 20:38)
another Korean go Fest (20:34 - 20:41)
or not go Safari Zone (20:38 - 20:43)
and people are like well I can't remote (20:41 - 20:46)
raid in I'm just gonna buy a ticket and (20:43 - 20:48)
then spoof my way over there and then (20:46 - 20:49)
exist (20:48 - 20:51)
and then that's going to ruin that event (20:49 - 20:53)
for those people because too many people (20:51 - 20:56)
like that even before I mean this (20:53 - 20:58)
happened like Vegas had this issue where (20:56 - 21:00)
actual people (20:58 - 21:00)
in the park (21:01 - 21:04)
there are too many people playing the (21:05 - 21:07)
game (21:06 - 21:09)
um but no I think they have been uh (21:07 - 21:11)
cracking down on spoofing more and more (21:09 - 21:13)
over time to the point where some (21:11 - 21:14)
people's accounts are getting locked (21:13 - 21:17)
when they wouldn't expect them to but (21:14 - 21:19)
this isn't a problem that I'm not uh (21:17 - 21:23)
sure they can fully solve (21:19 - 21:23)
yeah I mean if if the spoofing didn't (21:24 - 21:31)
ruin people's experiences like they (21:28 - 21:33)
probably wouldn't care as much I don't (21:31 - 21:36)
know maybe who's to say they they (21:33 - 21:39)
I mean if they cared about the values of (21:36 - 21:41)
the game enough to get rid of (21:39 - 21:43)
to put a cap on raid passes (21:41 - 21:45)
um (21:43 - 21:48)
spoofing is also against yeah but and I (21:45 - 21:51)
remember when gosh like (21:48 - 21:53)
four years ago on this program Greg will (21:51 - 21:55)
and I talked about how like it sucks (21:53 - 21:56)
that people are spoofing because Niantic (21:55 - 21:59)
has to like work to fix that instead of (21:56 - 22:02)
like working on like good features for (21:59 - 22:04)
the game (22:02 - 22:04)
um which like I don't know why Niantic (22:04 - 22:09)
doesn't specifically go after maybe (22:06 - 22:12)
there's a legal reason why like the webs (22:09 - 22:12)
maybe it's like the emulator (22:12 - 22:14)
conversation where it's like not illegal (22:12 - 22:16)
to have an emulator or to like sell an (22:14 - 22:21)
emulator but it's illegal to then (22:16 - 22:23)
download the ROMs to then run on the (22:21 - 22:25)
emulator (22:23 - 22:25)
like the emulator isn't the right (22:25 - 22:31)
problem right like a thing that can run (22:28 - 22:32)
a thing (22:31 - 22:36)
isn't the issue because that's generally (22:32 - 22:37)
not (22:36 - 22:41)
under cancer unless it's patented (22:37 - 22:44)
technology like the software to make a (22:41 - 22:46)
thing run generally isn't (22:44 - 22:49)
proprietary particularly for emulators (22:46 - 22:50)
they're like we're just skiing around (22:49 - 22:51)
this so that things can run we'll (22:50 - 22:53)
program it a different way like that's (22:51 - 22:55)
hard to do the copyright material that (22:53 - 22:58)
the program is that is owned by somebody (22:55 - 23:02)
and they can crack down on that (22:58 - 23:04)
um it gets complicated because there are (23:02 - 23:06)
also laws that are like you are allowed (23:04 - 23:10)
to have a backup of your things (23:06 - 23:12)
um and so a lot of emulations get around (23:10 - 23:14)
that by saying this is my backup to (23:12 - 23:16)
store things which I'm allowed legally (23:14 - 23:18)
to do because once I own it it is mine (23:16 - 23:20)
and then I need to be able to back it up (23:18 - 23:23)
it gets complicated really really really (23:20 - 23:25)
fast (23:23 - 23:29)
um and it's hard to sort of trample down (23:25 - 23:31)
legally (23:29 - 23:34)
like what is the best access to stop X (23:31 - 23:37)
from happening that doesn't accidentally (23:34 - 23:40)
make all of these other things suddenly (23:37 - 23:42)
a problem (23:40 - 23:43)
um and there aren't great there still (23:42 - 23:46)
aren't great answers like we have been (23:43 - 23:48)
fighting piracy (23:46 - 23:52)
forever like there's not great (23:48 - 23:55)
ways to do it because like the people (23:52 - 23:58)
who stop Pirates well the Pirates are (23:55 - 23:59)
just as good at programming they are (23:58 - 24:01)
going to come up with another (23:59 - 24:04)
way around it like it is a never-ending (24:01 - 24:06)
cycle yeah I just think of like when I'm (24:04 - 24:07)
on Tick Tock and then I get like the (24:06 - 24:10)
spoofers on Tick Tock that are like (24:07 - 24:13)
walking in some way of area that has (24:10 - 24:14)
like a million gyms and stuff and (24:13 - 24:16)
they're like give me roses and I'll (24:14 - 24:19)
invite you to the the gym which is (24:16 - 24:21)
ultimately like pay me and I will invite (24:19 - 24:24)
you to these gyms (24:21 - 24:24)
um (24:24 - 24:26)
but then they then people will ask like (24:24 - 24:29)
oh how did like what do you and they (24:26 - 24:32)
always say a website there's like and I (24:29 - 24:33)
think to myself like why doesn't Niantic (24:32 - 24:36)
go after the websites because if the (24:33 - 24:37)
website is shut down then people can't (24:36 - 24:41)
get the software to do the thing (24:37 - 24:44)
I don't know I again I don't (24:41 - 24:44)
I don't know the legal issue maybe they (24:45 - 24:49)
do take down the website and then maybe (24:48 - 24:51)
they just put up another website that's (24:49 - 24:52)
like (24:51 - 24:56)
yeah far as fast as Things Fall as we've (24:52 - 24:58)
learned they can quickly come back like (24:56 - 25:01)
you have to get on board you also have (24:58 - 25:04)
to Niantic has to be able to (25:01 - 25:06)
affect (25:04 - 25:09)
the country where the website is oh so (25:06 - 25:12)
the website could be in like Romania or (25:09 - 25:14)
something it could be in Russia it could (25:12 - 25:17)
be in the Netherlands like it could be (25:14 - 25:19)
anywhere and so it when you're trying to (25:17 - 25:22)
shut like it's like emulators and piracy (25:19 - 25:23)
like I (25:22 - 25:27)
hey spoiler alert my game was stolen (25:23 - 25:30)
and put up on a website for free uh it (25:27 - 25:33)
was in Sweden and I could do (25:30 - 25:36)
nothing about it because I can't bring a (25:33 - 25:40)
court case or copyright law (25:36 - 25:42)
to Sweden (25:40 - 25:45)
without a ton of money a ton of (25:42 - 25:47)
international lawyers I just had to sit (25:45 - 25:50)
there and go well they stoled my game (25:47 - 25:51)
cool I thought Swedish people were very (25:50 - 25:55)
nice I can literally do nothing about it (25:51 - 25:58)
I thought Swedish people were very nice (25:55 - 26:01)
they are people people are like (25:58 - 26:03)
everybody else yep (26:01 - 26:06)
uh I wrote down on our notes rant here's (26:03 - 26:09)
my here's my here's my actual well (26:06 - 26:12)
I have childhood trauma when it comes to (26:09 - 26:14)
holidays I needed to get that out (26:12 - 26:16)
uh here here's the thing that I've (26:14 - 26:20)
noticed since the raid pass change and (26:16 - 26:22)
um this is maybe a hot take (26:20 - 26:24)
uh but (26:22 - 26:29)
there are players to this game Pokemon (26:24 - 26:33)
go that are (26:29 - 26:38)
equal to somebody addicted to gambling (26:33 - 26:41)
and before like I am not like I know (26:38 - 26:43)
there are accessibility issues I know (26:41 - 26:45)
that remote rate passes are really great (26:43 - 26:47)
for people in (26:45 - 26:47)
um (26:47 - 26:49)
the middle of nowhere I know they're (26:47 - 26:51)
really great for people who have trouble (26:49 - 26:53)
walking I am not talking about these (26:51 - 26:54)
players (26:53 - 26:58)
at all but I think with the changes to (26:54 - 27:00)
remote raid passes it is it is very (26:58 - 27:03)
clear that there is a certain set of (27:00 - 27:05)
players again I'm not talking about the (27:03 - 27:06)
you know the people in the middle of (27:05 - 27:09)
nowhere the disabled people that are so (27:06 - 27:11)
addicted to this game that they have (27:09 - 27:13)
done things that gamblers have do and (27:11 - 27:16)
they are lashing out and they are angry (27:13 - 27:19)
and they are grasping onto any reason (27:16 - 27:23)
they can to like bring back the the or (27:19 - 27:25)
to revert the changes because they are (27:23 - 27:27)
addicted to this game I think there are (27:25 - 27:31)
a ton of people that are that are like (27:27 - 27:33)
the ton of people that are addicted to (27:31 - 27:34)
this game that do not care about (27:33 - 27:37)
disabled people do not care about people (27:34 - 27:39)
in the middle of nowhere they only care (27:37 - 27:41)
about being able to spend as much money (27:39 - 27:43)
as possible to feed their gambling (27:41 - 27:45)
addiction because they are truly (27:43 - 27:46)
addicted to this game (27:45 - 27:48)
and I'm talking about the people who are (27:46 - 27:49)
spending (27:48 - 27:51)
twenty dollars a day in rate passes or a (27:49 - 27:53)
hundred dollars a week in rate passes (27:51 - 27:55)
the people that will not stop giving (27:53 - 27:58)
Niantic a dollar and a dollar and a (27:55 - 28:00)
dollar until they get a hundred IV until (27:58 - 28:02)
they get a shiny until they get a (28:00 - 28:05)
hundred IV shiny like like these people (28:02 - 28:10)
exist and it is very clear now that (28:05 - 28:12)
because their addiction is pretty much (28:10 - 28:14)
cut off because the casino was like Hey (28:12 - 28:18)
we're closing they are angry (28:14 - 28:21)
um and again this is not to I'm not (28:18 - 28:24)
defending that I am not saying that they (28:21 - 28:26)
hear us Niantic movement should be (28:24 - 28:27)
stopped I'm just saying that these (28:26 - 28:29)
people have a serious problem like they (28:27 - 28:32)
are addicted (28:29 - 28:35)
and and uh (28:32 - 28:38)
and it sucks like it doesn't even matter (28:35 - 28:40)
that it's Pokemon go it is any mobile (28:38 - 28:42)
game it is a it could be any gotcha game (28:40 - 28:44)
it could be genshin impact it could be (28:42 - 28:46)
Pokemon Masters where if you are putting (28:44 - 28:49)
that much money in constantly you have (28:46 - 28:51)
an addiction problem (28:49 - 28:52)
and like (28:51 - 28:54)
that's not good (28:52 - 28:57)
no no nobody should be giving Pokemon go (28:54 - 29:00)
like a hundred dollars a week and (28:57 - 29:01)
somebody be like Steve it's their money (29:00 - 29:04)
they can do with what they want yeah and (29:01 - 29:06)
tell that to somebody who's gambling and (29:04 - 29:08)
loses everything at a casino like (29:06 - 29:11)
maybe maybe they are very well off maybe (29:08 - 29:13)
they're very successful where like 100 a (29:11 - 29:17)
week is literally nothing to them (29:13 - 29:17)
I don't know I've I've definitely met (29:17 - 29:20)
some people at like twitchcon or other (29:19 - 29:23)
conventions where they brag about having (29:20 - 29:25)
like every single item in Apex Legends (29:23 - 29:27)
and it's like (29:25 - 29:30)
okay man like if that's where you're (29:27 - 29:34)
putting your money ah okay (29:30 - 29:36)
like that's (29:34 - 29:41)
stuffed like I just I think about like (29:36 - 29:41)
I think about if you like told somebody (29:41 - 29:45)
what you were doing like somebody who (29:44 - 29:48)
didn't play Pokemon go like if I like (29:45 - 29:50)
the Deoxys situation (29:48 - 29:54)
I spent 52 dollars I did 52 raids (29:50 - 29:57)
for shiny Deoxys very sunk cost fallacy (29:54 - 30:00)
in that and if I told somebody who never (29:57 - 30:03)
played Pokemon go I spent 52 dollars for (30:00 - 30:05)
a slightly different colored Pokemon (30:03 - 30:08)
they would they would ask me to maybe (30:05 - 30:10)
seek like medical help like that that is (30:08 - 30:12)
like a lot of money for something in the (30:10 - 30:14)
grand scheme of things that doesn't (30:12 - 30:16)
matter and I know that Pokemon go brings (30:14 - 30:18)
passion but like again I'm not talking (30:16 - 30:20)
about I am I am talking about people who (30:18 - 30:22)
are severely addicted to this game and (30:20 - 30:26)
it is and I I I I just want to say we (30:22 - 30:28)
need to be very careful (30:26 - 30:30)
when we are talking about it yeah (30:28 - 30:33)
because gambling is a very terrible that (30:30 - 30:36)
there there is a very specific set of (30:33 - 30:39)
requirements to be labeled as addictive (30:36 - 30:42)
behavior I am definitely spending a lot (30:39 - 30:44)
of money on what is and is not addiction (30:42 - 30:47)
can be one of them but it is not the (30:44 - 30:49)
only sign that makes up an addiction (30:47 - 30:51)
problem (30:49 - 30:54)
um so (30:51 - 30:54)
I'm not comfortable with saying people (30:54 - 31:01)
are addicted to X because I don't know (30:56 - 31:03)
their situation I don't know what's (31:01 - 31:06)
happening to them I will say that people (31:03 - 31:08)
who very very very much enjoy things and (31:06 - 31:10)
put a lot of money in it may be very (31:08 - 31:13)
upset I'm not comfortable calling them (31:10 - 31:15)
addicted (31:13 - 31:18)
um I do think that anybody who puts a 10 (31:15 - 31:21)
of many things in it and the game is not (31:18 - 31:23)
giving them what they want back should (31:21 - 31:25)
re-evaluate their relationships you said (31:23 - 31:28)
100 game or a set thing (31:25 - 31:29)
um I'm not comfortable going as far as (31:28 - 31:31)
saying they're addicted to X because (31:29 - 31:34)
there's a lot that there's just a lot (31:31 - 31:35)
there (31:34 - 31:36)
um (31:35 - 31:39)
there are definitions there I'm not sure (31:36 - 31:42)
we know what they are yes and that's why (31:39 - 31:46)
I I preface I I said this is this is (31:42 - 31:48)
probably a hot take but like mobile (31:46 - 31:51)
games are they they didn't fall into (31:48 - 31:54)
this pattern they they had they are (31:51 - 31:56)
curated and they are specifically (31:54 - 32:01)
designed and to to pinch and get you to (31:56 - 32:03)
spend money the whole reason that there (32:01 - 32:06)
is a free box in the shop for Pokemon go (32:03 - 32:10)
is so you look at the store items every (32:06 - 32:11)
single day (32:10 - 32:14)
like there is a lot of dark patterns if (32:11 - 32:16)
you don't know what a dark pattern is (32:14 - 32:18)
look it up but there are there are a (32:16 - 32:20)
bunch of dark patterns almost every (32:18 - 32:22)
single mobile game yeah and again this (32:20 - 32:24)
is not a specific (32:22 - 32:26)
issue to Pokemon go there are plenty of (32:24 - 32:29)
games where people sink a lot of money (32:26 - 32:32)
into uh (32:29 - 32:32)
I have noticed so (32:32 - 32:37)
since the raid pass changed there are a (32:35 - 32:39)
lot there are I shouldn't say a lot (32:37 - 32:42)
there are Pokemon go players lashing out (32:39 - 32:45)
to other Pokemon go players in very (32:42 - 32:47)
unhealthy ways and I wish it was as easy (32:45 - 32:50)
as saying if this game does not bring (32:47 - 32:53)
you Joy it is okay to take a step back (32:50 - 32:56)
uh you know what it's not okay for these (32:53 - 32:59)
players to find an entire list of every (32:56 - 33:01)
single employee that worked at Niantic (32:59 - 33:04)
and then Circle it around the internet (33:01 - 33:06)
it is not okay for these players to send (33:04 - 33:08)
people death threats or to find (33:06 - 33:11)
niantic's home addresses these are signs (33:08 - 33:12)
of probably people that are very (33:11 - 33:15)
addicted to this game and their stuff is (33:12 - 33:17)
taken away (33:15 - 33:17)
there there are people who are very (33:20 - 33:27)
passionate to a toxic degree again I am (33:23 - 33:29)
not comfortable saying addiction (33:27 - 33:34)
um I will say that just like any (33:29 - 33:34)
any fandom where part of the fandom (33:35 - 33:43)
becomes a major part of your identity it (33:39 - 33:45)
is very easy to fall into toxic behavior (33:43 - 33:48)
and we see that across multiple fandoms (33:45 - 33:52)
believe me if you want to see a lot of (33:48 - 33:54)
this happening Star Wars celebration (33:52 - 33:57)
happened this weekend there are a lot of (33:54 - 33:59)
people who are just as angry who are (33:57 - 34:01)
doing the exact same thing who aren't (33:59 - 34:04)
giving money to Star Wars like you can't (34:01 - 34:06)
pay (34:04 - 34:09)
more money to get more Star Wars TVs or (34:06 - 34:10)
movies are going to come out when they (34:09 - 34:12)
come out whose behavior is exactly the (34:10 - 34:15)
same her doing the exact same things as (34:12 - 34:18)
Pokemon go players when you make (34:15 - 34:20)
something that is so tied to your (34:18 - 34:23)
personality when it becomes who you are (34:20 - 34:27)
when there's a threat on that you take (34:23 - 34:29)
it as a threat on yourself and you (34:27 - 34:32)
behave accordingly that is a problem (34:29 - 34:34)
that is existing in many many many many (34:32 - 34:36)
fandoms so again I don't want to say (34:34 - 34:39)
that you are addicted to X because that (34:36 - 34:42)
is a very complicated thing I will say (34:39 - 34:44)
that when it becomes your core identity (34:42 - 34:47)
that you go to such lengths (34:44 - 34:50)
such as hunting people down and sending (34:47 - 34:51)
them death threats you need to (34:50 - 34:54)
re-examine yourself and why you identify (34:51 - 34:57)
with X over The exclusion of everything (34:54 - 34:58)
else (34:57 - 34:59)
um (34:58 - 35:02)
it is bad like I saw what was happening (34:59 - 35:06)
people are angry people again this is (35:02 - 35:08)
their thing and when their thing is (35:06 - 35:13)
under attack they lash out that is (35:08 - 35:16)
that is a horrible aspect of today's (35:13 - 35:18)
modern world of a million brands (35:16 - 35:22)
saying identify with us you're a you're (35:18 - 35:25)
a Mac or a PC you're an Android or an (35:22 - 35:28)
iPhone like that was a marketing scheme (35:25 - 35:30)
that has backfired (35:28 - 35:33)
in tremendous ways and we see it played (35:30 - 35:35)
out time and time when these things (35:33 - 35:40)
happen this stuff happens and (35:35 - 35:44)
it's bad like it is unequivocally or you (35:40 - 35:47)
do not these people like they cannot (35:44 - 35:49)
control the things you control they do (35:47 - 35:52)
not deserve this abuse nobody deserves (35:49 - 35:54)
this abuse (35:52 - 35:57)
you need to understand how to control (35:54 - 35:59)
your own emotions you need to understand (35:57 - 36:02)
that this isn't an attack on you and (35:59 - 36:05)
there are constructive ways to give (36:02 - 36:06)
feedback (36:05 - 36:08)
and destructive ways to give feedback (36:06 - 36:13)
and a lot of people get a lot of Boost (36:08 - 36:15)
from social media when they're (36:13 - 36:18)
destructive so like that is a known (36:15 - 36:20)
thing social media really boosts (36:18 - 36:23)
negativity you get a lot of eyes a lot (36:20 - 36:26)
of attention you get a lot of people (36:23 - 36:28)
coming out because the algorithms know (36:26 - 36:31)
to feed you that so it's a terrible (36:28 - 36:32)
cycle (36:31 - 36:34)
um it is (36:32 - 36:38)
not limited to any one fandom (36:34 - 36:40)
um but yeah like (36:38 - 36:43)
don't don't like I have received a lot (36:40 - 36:45)
of anger and hate for crap I've said I (36:43 - 36:47)
get it like whatever I'm (36:45 - 36:50)
fine random person it's never fun to get (36:47 - 36:51)
it (36:50 - 36:54)
um and you can you you know people tend (36:51 - 36:57)
to forget especially when (36:54 - 36:59)
you are just a series of texts somewhere (36:57 - 37:01)
that you aren't an actual human being (36:59 - 37:06)
like anonymity and the separation of you (37:01 - 37:07)
don't have tone of voice you don't have (37:06 - 37:09)
body language you just have words like (37:07 - 37:12)
all these feed into this psychological (37:09 - 37:14)
problem that exists of (37:12 - 37:18)
you can easily dehumanize people because (37:14 - 37:21)
you don't see them and you don't you (37:18 - 37:24)
it's easy to not recognize them as human (37:21 - 37:25)
um (37:24 - 37:29)
but yeah like just (37:25 - 37:29)
rethink (37:30 - 37:34)
again if you get this angry about (37:32 - 37:37)
something you might want to spend some (37:34 - 37:39)
time re-examining your relationship with (37:37 - 37:41)
said property (37:39 - 37:44)
uh you know if you're angry that spoiler (37:41 - 37:47)
alert Liza was in Star Wars (37:44 - 37:50)
again you maybe want to re-examine you (37:47 - 37:51)
know I don't think those people are (37:50 - 37:55)
listening to our show but I I I I (37:51 - 37:55)
think (37:57 - 37:59)
re-examine just re-examine just take (37:59 - 38:05)
some time to say is this for me anymore (38:02 - 38:08)
can I just live happy with my memories (38:05 - 38:11)
and move on to something else and the (38:08 - 38:12)
death threats on the community managers (38:11 - 38:15)
are not okay are not great (38:12 - 38:18)
as a person who also worked in (38:15 - 38:21)
I worked in Customer Care believe me (38:18 - 38:23)
death threats happened and everything I (38:21 - 38:27)
got I had a person on a phone (38:23 - 38:29)
tell me that they were going to come to (38:27 - 38:32)
the call center I was in (38:29 - 38:35)
and Hunt me down (38:32 - 38:36)
and (38:35 - 38:39)
take care of business (38:36 - 38:41)
I had to do the whole thing of a report (38:39 - 38:43)
of them I had to do police reports like (38:41 - 38:45)
this isn't just a this is a new thing (38:43 - 38:47)
this was 20 years ago I had people (38:45 - 38:50)
saying this directly in my ears for (38:47 - 38:51)
things that I was telling them from (38:50 - 38:54)
policy it's never good get some anger (38:51 - 38:56)
management control (38:54 - 38:59)
reevaluate (38:56 - 39:01)
take a chill bill (38:59 - 39:04)
yeah quit quit your toxic games like me (39:01 - 39:06)
and Greg quick Clash Royale (39:04 - 39:08)
yeah that well (39:06 - 39:12)
boy that needed to end that game is just (39:08 - 39:17)
not look I look also I don't play Go (39:12 - 39:20)
much anymore again I had to reevaluate (39:17 - 39:21)
my relationship with a game that was (39:20 - 39:23)
making me unhappy (39:21 - 39:28)
um and I did uh do I do I do I do things (39:23 - 39:30)
on the show yeah because it's part of (39:28 - 39:33)
this show but really most of the day I (39:30 - 39:35)
don't talk about it (39:33 - 39:38)
all right uh well let's take a break and (39:35 - 39:41)
when we come back we're gonna talk about (39:38 - 39:44)
um some some creatures uh restructuring (39:41 - 39:46)
although we don't know too much about it (39:44 - 39:47)
but (39:46 - 39:50)
uh maybe some fun facts about creatures (39:47 - 39:52)
so that'll be worth it uh we will be (39:50 - 39:56)
right back and we are back from our (39:52 - 39:57)
break (39:56 - 40:00)
uh we got some breaking news (39:57 - 40:03)
breaking news is that what they do they (40:00 - 40:06)
still do that yeah I mean this just in (40:03 - 40:08)
but it depends on your what who you (40:06 - 40:12)

better in charge of than Janine over at (41:13 - 41:18)
the Pokemon company uh they have done (41:15 - 41:20)
all the hisuian (41:18 - 41:23)
starters in a row with no weeks in (41:20 - 41:26)
between so yeah uh decidue Idaho Samurai (41:23 - 41:30)
Typhlosion Typhlosion which (41:26 - 41:34)
I personally find that to be a lot like (41:30 - 41:37)
very quick yep um but I've also gotten (41:34 - 41:38)
that from other people where they're (41:37 - 41:39)
like (41:38 - 41:42)
I love these raids but like this is (41:39 - 41:46)
every weekend is too much yeah (41:42 - 41:49)
it's kind of fast yeah I mean it's it's (41:46 - 41:52)
even if you were to say like well you (41:49 - 41:53)
don't you don't have to do the other (41:52 - 41:55)
weekend like there's a week at like you (41:53 - 41:56)
do the one week and then you take a week (41:55 - 41:58)
break even that (41:56 - 42:03)
Tempo feels like a lot like it feels (41:58 - 42:06)
like okay okay wait because you (42:03 - 42:08)
because you actually actually have to (42:06 - 42:10)
make things for a seven star raids like (42:08 - 42:12)
you actually have to which is cool (42:10 - 42:15)
um so it it tends to feel like (42:12 - 42:18)
oh I have to do a bunch of work for this (42:15 - 42:20)
and I have to do a bunch of work for (42:18 - 42:21)
this quickly (42:20 - 42:24)
and that (42:21 - 42:27)
tends to wear you out when it's (42:24 - 42:29)
one after the other you're like okay (42:27 - 42:32)
okay okay give me a break for like a hot (42:29 - 42:34)
second (42:32 - 42:37)
yeah no I feel that way too as somebody (42:34 - 42:38)
who like sits there and it's like okay (42:37 - 42:40)
let's go through all the options let's (42:38 - 42:41)
try to build optimal things so we have (42:40 - 42:43)
something (42:41 - 42:46)
I I feel like most people want something (42:43 - 42:48)
before they go into the weekend it's (42:46 - 42:50)
almost like the Pokemon go thing because (42:48 - 42:53)
like when the event starts people want (42:50 - 42:55)
to do it right away right like (42:53 - 42:57)
um the the Thursdays that these come out (42:55 - 43:00)
are some of my most popular stream days (42:57 - 43:01)
um and they're really fun because like (43:00 - 43:03)
so many people are so excited to get the (43:01 - 43:05)
Pokemon but (43:03 - 43:07)
I feel like if if you don't have a (43:05 - 43:09)
Pokemon ready by the time it shows shows (43:07 - 43:11)
up it feels like you're almost already (43:09 - 43:14)
behind yeah oh yeah oh yeah like like oh (43:11 - 43:16)
I okay what's working good okay let me (43:14 - 43:18)
see if I can build this oh everyone's (43:16 - 43:19)
kind of already done because like there (43:18 - 43:21)
are a bunch of people that are one and (43:19 - 43:25)
done they they get it and they move on (43:21 - 43:25)
um (43:25 - 43:27)
maybe they're just doing this because (43:25 - 43:29)
they're you know they're supposed to be (43:27 - 43:32)
an update at the end of April uh who (43:29 - 43:33)
knows if that's Pokemon home maybe (43:32 - 43:35)
that's like a little hasuian thing (43:33 - 43:38)
they're gonna do but like they there is (43:35 - 43:40)
no coincidence that they went from once (43:38 - 43:42)
a month to now (43:40 - 43:46)
every single week six weeks in a row for (43:42 - 43:48)
Typhlosion now to finish this off so (43:46 - 43:51)
they did say Pokemon (43:48 - 43:53)
home would come in Spring (43:51 - 43:56)
um April May June whatever spring is (43:53 - 44:01)
almost done or here now uh so maybe they (43:56 - 44:02)
wanted to get all the his Hui and stuff (44:01 - 44:03)
out of the way before they open up (44:02 - 44:05)
Pokemon home (44:03 - 44:09)
uh you know competitive people are (44:05 - 44:11)
really excited for Ursa Luna so that (44:09 - 44:13)
would be a thing like every Pokemon that (44:11 - 44:16)
could be hasuian (44:13 - 44:19)
is in the game like ursuling Ursula (44:16 - 44:22)
Ursula Ursa ring (44:19 - 44:24)
quill fish (44:22 - 44:27)
um sarua uh what are the other hasuian (44:24 - 44:30)
Pokemon that are hazel Sneasel oh my (44:27 - 44:32)
gosh niesler's gone (44:30 - 44:34)
like like all those Pokemon are in (44:32 - 44:37)
scarlet and violet so (44:34 - 44:40)
I'm more curious because obviously we (44:37 - 44:41)
know they're coming if they're going to (44:40 - 44:44)
do some sort of fanfare some maybe even (44:41 - 44:47)
if it's a small update being like these (44:44 - 44:49)
are how or why the history and Pokemon (44:47 - 44:52)
are here also we fixed the frame rate (44:49 - 44:54)
um because I do think it would be very (44:52 - 44:55)
uneventful for them to be like well now (44:54 - 44:58)
you can have ursuluna like there it is (44:55 - 45:01)
like (44:58 - 45:01)
I will say going back to the one and (45:01 - 45:07)
done thing this is why (45:04 - 45:10)
everybody do does Final Fantasy raids on (45:07 - 45:12)
Tuesday and nobody does them on the (45:10 - 45:15)
weekend because it resets on Tuesday (45:12 - 45:17)
everything done because it reset it's (45:15 - 45:20)
whatever does it on Tuesday and then the (45:17 - 45:22)
people who play on the weekends have a (45:20 - 45:23)
terrible experience because it's (45:22 - 45:25)
everybody who couldn't do it on Tuesday (45:23 - 45:27)
and they don't know what they're doing (45:25 - 45:29)
this is this is like the first that (45:27 - 45:32)
Thursday gets swapped and then the rest (45:29 - 45:33)
of the weekend can be a nightmare (45:32 - 45:38)
because everybody who is ready and done (45:33 - 45:39)
um (45:38 - 45:42)
did it the first day and then (45:39 - 45:44)
left (45:42 - 45:46)
yeah no that was like the same in in (45:44 - 45:49)
Destiny as well where (45:46 - 45:51)
if you weren't doing the raid or the (45:49 - 45:53)
Nightfall on Tuesday or Wednesday like (45:51 - 45:56)
good luck doing it this weekend because (45:53 - 45:57)
you're gonna get like you're gonna get (45:56 - 45:59)
the scraps left over people have asked (45:57 - 46:01)
when do you play Final Fantasy Tuesday (45:59 - 46:04)
and every Tuesday (46:01 - 46:07)
so yeah I mean I I even though I have (46:04 - 46:09)
all the resources I have all the (46:07 - 46:12)
vitamins I got all the Pokemon I got all (46:09 - 46:14)
the the money I'm swimming in money (46:12 - 46:16)
because I grind out these raids like I (46:14 - 46:20)
did the 999 bug I will never need 999 (46:16 - 46:23)
bug Tara shards but bug Tara is one of (46:20 - 46:26)
the worst Terrors ever (46:23 - 46:26)
um I even though I have all the (46:27 - 46:31)
resources I can't imagine somebody who (46:29 - 46:33)
maybe only plays like once a week to try (46:31 - 46:36)
to prep every two weeks for these right (46:33 - 46:38)
it's a lot and what they were doing (46:36 - 46:41)
before which was you know one seven star (46:38 - 46:43)
a month ultimately (46:41 - 46:46)
felt really well paced because the other (46:43 - 46:49)
weeks would be like blissy or ditto or (46:46 - 46:51)
something like a little bit smaller (46:49 - 46:53)
and it was like oh okay like like I (46:51 - 46:56)
skipped ditto I didn't look I'm done (46:53 - 47:00)
with breeding I'm I I I I I I don't care (46:56 - 47:01)
I'm I'm not I don't like trick room (47:00 - 47:03)
don't have to worry about that I'm just (47:01 - 47:05)
gonna bottle cap like I don't need to (47:03 - 47:08)
breed five IVs I'm just going to catch (47:05 - 47:10)
or find something and then just bottle (47:08 - 47:12)
cap it but to all the people who want to (47:10 - 47:13)
breathe (47:12 - 47:15)
that's cool but like I skipped that (47:13 - 47:19)
Adventures because I didn't need it (47:15 - 47:19)
frustrating (47:20 - 47:24)
then people showing up with their super (47:21 - 47:27)
powered ditto as the leader and you're (47:24 - 47:29)
like please change (47:27 - 47:32)
please go to uh yeah you just have to (47:29 - 47:34)
not join those Reigns (47:32 - 47:36)
but maybe you want to practice against (47:34 - 47:38)
karate on maybe you want to get a little (47:36 - 47:41)
car ride on trading in (47:38 - 47:43)
I did a bunch of those raids they were (47:41 - 47:45)
fun but it is yeah it is kind of (47:43 - 47:47)
annoying when they do the the smaller (47:45 - 47:50)
special raids on the same weekends as (47:47 - 47:52)
the big special rates (47:50 - 47:56)
yeah I I think it's (47:52 - 47:56)
I think it would feel better if the (47:56 - 48:00)
again if there was a week in between (47:58 - 48:03)
like when they did decidueye when they (48:00 - 48:05)
did say like well Sam samrat's second (48:03 - 48:08)
week was over the global challenge which (48:05 - 48:10)
was a tournament (48:08 - 48:12)
um which was already time consuming (48:10 - 48:13)
enough (48:12 - 48:16)
uh but decidue I had the like Chansey or (48:13 - 48:19)
the Blissey or Chansey (48:16 - 48:21)
um and that was nice to do like okay I (48:19 - 48:23)
already did a bunch of decidueye last (48:21 - 48:25)
week I'll do some decidueye this week (48:23 - 48:26)
but in between we'll squeeze in some (48:25 - 48:29)
chances but because it's like six weeks (48:26 - 48:30)
in a row (48:29 - 48:32)
and then like ditto overlapped with the (48:30 - 48:35)
global Challenge and Samurott it was a (48:32 - 48:37)
there's there's way too much going on in (48:35 - 48:39)
this video game right now (48:37 - 48:40)
yeah (48:39 - 48:43)
which which is like a weird thing to say (48:40 - 48:45)
about a Pokemon game because we were (48:43 - 48:46)
like ah there's nothing to do after (48:45 - 48:50)
credits there's too much to do right now (48:46 - 48:50)
if you're trying to do everything (48:51 - 48:58)
yeah yeah that's a lot do I do the (48:55 - 49:00)
global international challenge or do I (48:58 - 49:03)
wake up and I go get a red yellow key (49:00 - 49:06)
there's a lot well um (49:03 - 49:10)
so I you know usually our podcast is (49:06 - 49:12)
recorded before this end I I will you (49:10 - 49:15)
know I'll put it all on Monday nights on (49:12 - 49:16)
Twitch we'll do a raid build video we'll (49:15 - 49:18)
go through all the moves uh type of (49:16 - 49:21)
ocean can learn and lot learn what we (49:18 - 49:24)
think the gimmick is going to be uh on (49:21 - 49:27)
Tuesday we'll build those Pokemon or (49:24 - 49:29)
finalize on Wednesday YouTube video (49:27 - 49:30)
should go up and then on Thursday night (49:29 - 49:33)
if you need help on the 13th Thursday (49:30 - 49:35)
the 13th I believe it should start at 7 (49:33 - 49:37)
pm central time (49:35 - 49:39)
um twitch be able to help you out I'm (49:37 - 49:41)
going to make a guess right now that (49:39 - 49:43)
Hisui and zorark is going to be really (49:41 - 49:45)
good for this because uh the ghost move (49:43 - 49:47)
it learns is Shadow Ball there's another (49:45 - 49:49)
ghost move it learns but that's the only (49:47 - 49:51)
the history form so that you can't have (49:49 - 49:52)
that one (49:51 - 49:55)
um so Shadow Ball can't hit zorark (49:52 - 49:59)
uh because it's normal ghost which I (49:55 - 50:00)
think is kind of funny because it's (49:59 - 50:02)
almost like (50:00 - 50:05)
pay to win like did you buy the DLC to (50:02 - 50:07)
get the good Pokemon I mean you can (50:05 - 50:09)
breed it like like if somebody needs a (50:07 - 50:10)
sword yeah (50:09 - 50:13)
they're in the wild now yeah yeah so (50:10 - 50:15)
like if you need hanasui and Zoroark egg (50:13 - 50:17)
I'm sure the Discord or the slack I'm (50:15 - 50:18)
sure either of those can get you I'm (50:17 - 50:20)
gonna I'm gonna say that that's probably (50:18 - 50:23)
that's probably gonna be an okay Choice (50:20 - 50:25)
um obviously we'll still have fire type (50:23 - 50:28)
stab same type attack bonus so we'll (50:25 - 50:30)
just have to see how strong that is (50:28 - 50:32)
against the arc I'll have to run the (50:30 - 50:34)
calculations to see if it (50:32 - 50:38)
survives it I'm sure it will be fine but (50:34 - 50:39)
it can't get hit by Shadow balls that's (50:38 - 50:41)
cool (50:39 - 50:41)
uh maybe I'm also thinking maybe stunky (50:41 - 50:46)
would be okay because (50:44 - 50:47)
it's dark (50:46 - 50:50)
also gets access to acid spray (50:47 - 50:53)
um anyways (50:50 - 50:57)
uh speaking of acid uh Monster Energy (50:53 - 51:00)
what a good transition Monster Energy (50:57 - 51:05)
has uh filed a trademark uh complaint (51:00 - 51:08)
against Pokemon and Monster Hunter over (51:05 - 51:12)
the word of monster (51:08 - 51:14)
uh I just want to say that we're a g (51:12 - 51:17)
fuel family here 20 off G feel with code (51:14 - 51:21)
PK mncasd uh this is off comicbook.com (51:17 - 51:23)
uh Monster Energy has filed a trademark (51:21 - 51:24)
complaints against both Pokemon and (51:23 - 51:27)
Monster Hunter franchises in Japan over (51:24 - 51:30)
the word monster and they have been (51:27 - 51:32)
unsuccessful in the past the Japanese (51:30 - 51:36)
website autumn autumn autom that's not (51:32 - 51:38)
automation there's missing letters (51:36 - 51:41)
automaton uncovered over a hundred (51:38 - 51:43)
trademark complaints filed by Monster (51:41 - 51:45)
Energy company the parent company of (51:43 - 51:46)
Monster energy drinks over the word (51:45 - 51:48)
Monster uh the complaints include (51:46 - 51:51)
filings against X and Y sun and moon (51:48 - 51:53)
Monster Hunter cross along with (51:51 - 51:55)
following against the Monster Hunter (51:53 - 51:58)
trademark as a whole they have been (51:55 - 52:00)
routinely denied although monster (51:58 - 52:03)
beverage continues to file complaints to (52:00 - 52:07)
this day just recently Monster Hunter (52:03 - 52:09)
Energy company (52:07 - 52:11)
Monster Energy company filed a complaint (52:09 - 52:14)
against dark deception monsters and (52:11 - 52:17)
Mortals over the use of monster in the (52:14 - 52:18)
title (52:17 - 52:22)
uh the article goes on but (52:18 - 52:24)
I'm not a lawyer is there a long-term (52:22 - 52:27)
strategy to this like event like as if (52:24 - 52:29)
they win one small one they like get (52:27 - 52:30)
their foot in the door is that what they (52:29 - 52:33)
win one small one generally they can use (52:30 - 52:35)
it as precedent to go after other things (52:33 - 52:39)
uh here's the thing (52:35 - 52:41)
it's gonna be real hard to win that (52:39 - 52:46)
because monster predates all of it (52:41 - 52:46)
it's really hard to own a word like that (52:47 - 52:53)
like Monster Energy can own their (52:51 - 52:56)
trademark symbol (52:53 - 52:59)
and be like you can never use this (52:56 - 53:02)
symbol and you have a case there but (52:59 - 53:05)
like monster the word has been in (53:02 - 53:08)
general use for a very very long time (53:05 - 53:09)
um (53:08 - 53:12)
so how do here's a fun here's a fun (53:09 - 53:15)
Story the reason why I know all about (53:12 - 53:20)
this is back when I was (53:15 - 53:20)
uh I was I was I was a part of a bunch (53:21 - 53:28)
of gay gamer boards on the internet (53:24 - 53:31)
and the common term for all of us was (53:28 - 53:33)
gamer (53:31 - 53:36)
g-a-y-m-e-r oh yeah yeah yeah and then (53:33 - 53:39)
gaygamer.net created and got popular and (53:36 - 53:42)
then wanted to make t-shirts and (53:39 - 53:45)
trademark that terms that only they (53:42 - 53:48)
could use it and we actually had to all (53:45 - 53:51)
a bunch of us had to like file (53:48 - 53:53)
reports saying we have been using this (53:51 - 53:56)
term it has been a general internet term (53:53 - 53:59)
longer than this website existed it (53:56 - 54:03)
became a whole thing like got (53:59 - 54:05)
levels of embroidment like people coming (54:03 - 54:07)
out of the woodwork and they're like (54:05 - 54:08)
well they're not trying to trademark the (54:07 - 54:10)
entire word or like read the brief yes (54:08 - 54:14)
they are so like I had to become versed (54:10 - 54:17)
in this to protect a term (54:14 - 54:20)
uh from being trademarked so that nobody (54:17 - 54:21)
else in the gay community would be (54:20 - 54:23)
allowed to use it unless they were part (54:21 - 54:26)
of that Forum so like I have dealt with (54:23 - 54:29)
this before uh in a different way where (54:26 - 54:31)
they like want to block it off so that (54:29 - 54:34)
you can only associate that word with (54:31 - 54:36)
their product and one of the one of the (54:34 - 54:38)
easiest ways around it was to say we can (54:36 - 54:42)
show usage long before they started (54:38 - 54:45)
using it they were not the first and so (54:42 - 54:46)
that's the same thing with monster (54:45 - 54:49)
Monster's been a part of the vernacular (54:46 - 54:52)
since language (54:49 - 54:52)
is what it says in the etymology online (54:52 - 54:58)
website early 14th century it's been (54:55 - 55:00)
around for a while it's been around it's (54:58 - 55:01)
hard to say that you owned that word (55:00 - 55:04)
when you're a company that was created I (55:01 - 55:07)
don't know let's say the 2000s (55:04 - 55:09)
they should be spending that money on (55:07 - 55:11)
like (55:09 - 55:15)
a Rebrand well it's not it's not (55:11 - 55:16)
necessarily that they're spending money (55:15 - 55:19)
right like this is often an automated (55:16 - 55:21)
system let a lawyer set up a while ago (55:19 - 55:23)
that just goes sends a brief off and (55:21 - 55:25)
says we're filing these complaints and (55:23 - 55:27)
somebody just has to do a search and be (55:25 - 55:29)
like here's a bunch of monster things (55:27 - 55:31)
send them in (55:29 - 55:33)
yeah I also think like energy companies (55:31 - 55:35)
I mean as somebody who works with one (55:33 - 55:37)
directly (55:35 - 55:39)
um I feel like energy companies and (55:37 - 55:41)
video games are so ingrained I know it's (55:39 - 55:44)
like a stereotype but like (55:41 - 55:47)
I don't know like why why would you ever (55:44 - 55:50)
want to like burn that bridge like I I (55:47 - 55:51)
don't see monster energy ever partnering (55:50 - 55:53)
with Pokemon (55:51 - 55:55)
but like I definitely see monster energy (55:53 - 55:58)
partnering with Monster Hunter like that (55:55 - 56:00)
actually seems like something that would (55:58 - 56:02)
work sort of like yeah hunt I don't know (56:00 - 56:04)
monster in the wild you could have (56:02 - 56:07)
specialized cans look I got a right yeah (56:04 - 56:10)
this is the Diablos can I need a job (56:07 - 56:13)
Monster Energy hire me (56:10 - 56:16)
I it just seems like (56:13 - 56:16)
I don't know again maybe if they win a (56:17 - 56:20)
small one they can like use it against (56:18 - 56:22)
bigger companies but it's literally (56:20 - 56:24)
following lawsuits you should be like (56:22 - 56:26)
hey I would like to partner with your (56:24 - 56:28)
video game it's where they're doing it (56:26 - 56:30)
in Japan like I don't know Japan's (56:28 - 56:33)
trademark laws very well uh so I'm just (56:30 - 56:35)
curious definitely have monsters in (56:33 - 56:38)
their family Marts and 7-Elevens like (56:35 - 56:39)
yeah I don't I don't why are you only (56:38 - 56:40)
doing in Japan I mean I guess that's (56:39 - 56:43)
where the parent companies are oh (56:40 - 56:45)
probably but like it does say that (56:43 - 56:47)
Monster energy is a notorious trademark (56:45 - 56:49)
troll so like this is just what they do (56:47 - 56:51)
didn't they guess what we're talking (56:49 - 56:53)
about it so (56:51 - 56:55)
didn't they wait didn't Monster Energy (56:53 - 56:58)
win against bang and made bang file for (56:55 - 57:00)
bankruptcy (56:58 - 57:01)
I think they did (57:00 - 57:06)
because I think bang lied about like two (57:01 - 57:08)
of their ingredients (57:06 - 57:11)
and monster called them out on it (57:08 - 57:14)
and then they they ended up having to (57:11 - 57:17)
file them for bankruptcy (57:14 - 57:17)
yeah energy drink cast well they want to (57:17 - 57:24)
get your door in here uh (57:21 - 57:26)
false advertising conversation yes (57:24 - 57:29)
advertising a real thing the one (57:26 - 57:34)
according to this uh 293 million dollars (57:29 - 57:36)
yeah see they don't need Monster Hunter (57:34 - 57:38)
Pokemon they have beat out their (57:36 - 57:42)
competition they seem to be (57:38 - 57:45)
it was pretty that bang would show up at (57:42 - 57:48)
twitchcon uh or other conventions I I (57:45 - 57:51)
know this because again I work with G (57:48 - 57:53)
fuel which would be monsters competition (57:51 - 57:56)
and bangs competition but a lot of (57:53 - 57:59)
conventions at a certain point change (57:56 - 58:02)
their rules to have no Booth babes I (57:59 - 58:04)
don't know people know what Booth babes (58:02 - 58:06)
are just yeah ladies not wearing a lot (58:04 - 58:08)
of clothing (58:06 - 58:11)
um and bang would show up to these (58:08 - 58:12)
events (58:11 - 58:15)
and they would have Booth babes when (58:12 - 58:17)
everyone like that with the industry (58:15 - 58:19)
like they kind of stopped saying like no (58:17 - 58:20)
more Booth babe because people just (58:19 - 58:21)
stopped doing it after a while they've (58:20 - 58:23)
had a hard role and then it like kind of (58:21 - 58:26)
like faded out anyways over time and it (58:23 - 58:29)
was very jarring to like walk around (58:26 - 58:32)
twitchcon and like everyone like I I did (58:29 - 58:33)
feel like there was a point before the (58:32 - 58:35)
pandemic where conventions got a little (58:33 - 58:38)
bit more like personable and like not (58:35 - 58:40)
over the top in your face like screaming (58:38 - 58:42)
at you to like check out their booth and (58:40 - 58:45)
like you'd walk by bang and they would (58:42 - 58:48)
just have a lot of ladies in in very (58:45 - 58:50)
little clothing and they were just (58:48 - 58:52)
blasting music and you were like did I (58:50 - 58:57)
get Warped into like 1999 like what is (58:52 - 59:00)
going on right now and like there was a (58:57 - 59:02)
strict no Boothbay rule but like no one (59:00 - 59:06)
enforced it for them when they're (59:02 - 59:08)
bankrupt now so (59:06 - 59:11)
yeah they so they lost because bang was (59:08 - 59:15)
claiming that they had super creatine in (59:11 - 59:18)
their ingredients uh and Monster's like (59:15 - 59:21)
you don't have any creatine in it at all (59:18 - 59:23)
uh so the health benefits are a complete (59:21 - 59:26)
lie and then the durian said yeah (59:23 - 59:30)
[Laughter] (59:26 - 59:33)
[Music] (59:30 - 59:36)
yeah man this is a wild podcast today (59:33 - 59:38)
we're talking about lawsuits but (59:36 - 59:40)
okay the only thing here's the thing (59:38 - 59:42)
there was a short there was a short (59:40 - 59:45)
brief period of Booth babe conventions (59:42 - 59:48)
where some companies went to Booth boys (59:45 - 59:51)
I was kind of into that (59:48 - 59:55)
but overall because I went to E3 which I (59:51 - 59:58)
uh you went to E3 yeah I got snuck into (59:55 - 59:59)
E3 (59:58 - 60:02)
that was that was that was a wild time (59:59 - 60:03)
too when people got snuck into you (60:02 - 60:05)
you're stuck into E3 I also got stuck (60:03 - 60:06)
into uh into the premiere of The (60:05 - 60:08)
Poseidon Adventure that was only for (60:06 - 60:09)
employees but that's another story (60:08 - 60:12)
entirely as well (60:09 - 60:13)
but (60:12 - 60:16)
again and (60:13 - 60:16)
Booth babes could always pick us out (60:17 - 60:21)
because we'd walk in and we'd be looking (60:20 - 60:23)
at things and not at them and they'd be (60:21 - 60:25)
they would all like breathe this sigh of (60:23 - 60:27)
release because they knew they were not (60:25 - 60:30)
going to get like hit on by our crew (60:27 - 60:33)
because they'd be like oh thank God yeah (60:30 - 60:34)
you're all fine and you're not going to (60:33 - 60:35)
be like (60:34 - 60:37)
we actually care about the product we're (60:35 - 60:38)
supposed to be saying like we're like (60:37 - 60:41)
could you tell me about this game (60:38 - 60:42)
um and then there's a brief window when (60:41 - 60:45)
they were like let's do both boys and (60:42 - 60:48)
Booth babes which lasted about a year or (60:45 - 60:50)
two and then everybody said this is a (60:48 - 60:52)
noxious and garbage please stop also (60:50 - 60:55)
it's a liability because harassment (60:52 - 60:59)
lawsuits happened at every con (60:55 - 60:59)
I don't have a good transition into (61:04 - 61:08)
Unova region sitting cuties available (61:06 - 61:10)
now at Pokemon so what they need to do (61:08 - 61:14)
is they have to have Booth cuties ah (61:10 - 61:16)
there we go with (61:14 - 61:20)
174 Charming new plush Pokemon to choose (61:16 - 61:23)
from you'll bound to find one or several (61:20 - 61:26)
that you can set up at your booth some (61:23 - 61:28)
look more Charming than others look at (61:26 - 61:33)
these designs now there are 156. (61:28 - 61:36)
Pokemon in the Unova pokedex if I (61:33 - 61:38)
remember correctly it is the biggest (61:36 - 61:40)
Pokedex out of all of them they are (61:38 - 61:44)
saying 174 uh I believe that is because (61:40 - 61:47)
there are some different forms (61:44 - 61:50)
um like all the The Landry (61:47 - 61:52)
uh have two of each (61:50 - 61:54)
as well as (61:52 - 61:56)
Keldeo and Meloetta would have two of (61:54 - 61:59)
each and there's all the sauce book and (61:56 - 62:01)
deerling yeah oh I was like there's yeah (61:59 - 62:02)
I saw his book and darling yeah that (62:01 - 62:05)
would be eight right there (62:02 - 62:07)
uh sitting cutie collection has entered (62:05 - 62:09)
Unova they're available now at Pokemon (62:07 - 62:12)
Center 174. uh (62:09 - 62:14)
there was also like a secret price (62:12 - 62:17)
increase for some of these Pokemon (62:14 - 62:19)
um most of them were always like (62:17 - 62:22)
I think 11 right 11 or 12.99 (62:19 - 62:24)
um and now some of these same Cuties are (62:22 - 62:28)
up to like 15 16 yeah so it looks like (62:24 - 62:30)
those are the more complicated ones and (62:28 - 62:33)
they look bigger yeah like the Zekrom is (62:30 - 62:35)
six inches for 14.99 (62:33 - 62:39)
uh the Bisharp is six and a quarter (62:35 - 62:42)
inches for 14.99 but chinchino is five (62:39 - 62:44)
and a half so you're getting ripped off (62:42 - 62:46)
on the jingina one so don't get the (62:44 - 62:47)
chance (62:46 - 62:49)
uh do we have any that are sold out yet (62:47 - 62:52)
no not that I'm seeing they might have (62:49 - 62:54)
they might have actually properly that (62:52 - 62:55)
was a nightmare with uh what was like (62:54 - 62:57)
both gen 3 and Gen 4 like we put them up (62:55 - 63:00)
and they would instantly sell out (62:57 - 63:01)
um (63:00 - 63:06)
the most most of these look good (63:01 - 63:10)
yes I would I would agree that most look (63:06 - 63:13)
good I feel like Oh The Goth the gotha (63:10 - 63:15)
tell is not looking great (63:13 - 63:18)
um I would say I would I would I would I (63:15 - 63:20)
would say if they look bad it's because (63:18 - 63:25)
they're just a bad Pokemon anyways (63:20 - 63:25)
look really good though there are some (63:26 - 63:29)
of these that I wouldn't expect to turn (63:27 - 63:33)
out well in plush form (63:29 - 63:33)
the ferocity looks really bad (63:33 - 63:38)
uh it looks very bad (63:35 - 63:39)
um drudigan looks bad but dreadican (63:38 - 63:43)
always looks bad yeah try it again has (63:39 - 63:44)
its own style (63:43 - 63:47)
brizianism isn't great virus got a kind (63:44 - 63:49)
of uh (63:47 - 63:52)
kind of a wide wide glassy eye vision (63:49 - 63:55)
thing like yeah (63:52 - 63:57)
it kind of got its head flattened a (63:55 - 63:59)
little bit this is a little it's a (63:57 - 64:02)
little rough uh fungus not looking good (63:59 - 64:03)
I think both masculines are looking (64:02 - 64:07)
great I think is not a hard design to (64:03 - 64:11)
get right I think p-duff looks excellent (64:07 - 64:13)
yeah (64:11 - 64:17)
oh he bar looks terrible (64:13 - 64:19)
yeah track a tracking does not look (64:17 - 64:21)
great either tracheon looks a little (64:19 - 64:24)
crappy about about life in general okay (64:21 - 64:25)
I think when they sell out they (64:24 - 64:28)
disappear because I I there's no way I (64:25 - 64:32)
just scrub through 174 Pokemon (64:28 - 64:34)
I think they do the thing where if they (64:32 - 64:36)
sell like what would it be (64:34 - 64:38)
oh gosh I don't even know what I haven't (64:36 - 64:41)
seen yet I haven't seen Snivy (64:38 - 64:45)
oh snap he's there Snivy (64:41 - 64:48)
okay Snivy sitting cutie (64:45 - 64:49)

the ducklet looks incredible like (65:57 - 66:02)
whoever whoever made made them put a lot (65:59 - 66:05)
of work into the ducklet I also think (66:02 - 66:06)
archeops would be on there because he's (66:05 - 66:08)
looking really good (66:06 - 66:10)
but I don't know what number three would (66:08 - 66:13)
be like maybe trubbish (66:10 - 66:15)

they go to the Pokemon company so they (71:57 - 72:03)
they go to the Japan office the Pokemon (72:00 - 72:04)
company International there are two (72:03 - 72:06)
headquarters (72:04 - 72:09)
one is in Bellevue Seattle Bellevue (72:06 - 72:11)
where one of those side cities I think (72:09 - 72:12)
it's Bellevue (72:11 - 72:15)
um not actually the city next to it uh (72:12 - 72:18)
and then the other one I believe is in (72:15 - 72:20)
London slash probably a city around (72:18 - 72:22)
there so there's a UK office and then (72:20 - 72:25)
there's the American office and then (72:22 - 72:28)
um the Pokemon company is Japan which is (72:25 - 72:30)
ishihara he's still there he's still (72:28 - 72:33)
there now creatures (72:30 - 72:38)
does some stuff they also are part of (72:33 - 72:42)
what makes up the Pokemon company so the (72:38 - 72:44)
Pokemon company itself not to be (72:42 - 72:45)
confused with the Pokemon company (72:44 - 72:47)
International this is hard to follow the (72:45 - 72:48)
Pokemon company itself is made up of (72:47 - 72:53)
Nintendo game freak and creatures so (72:48 - 72:54)
even though he has stepped down from (72:53 - 72:57)
creatures he's still in charge of the (72:54 - 72:59)
whole shebang (72:57 - 73:01)
um so I don't think we would see a lot (72:59 - 73:03)
of (73:01 - 73:05)
differences like I don't I don't think (73:03 - 73:07)
like oh suddenly something's going to (73:05 - 73:10)
change in the next six months (73:07 - 73:13)
maybe his workload is like too much and (73:10 - 73:14)
it was like let's give it to somebody (73:13 - 73:15)
else (73:14 - 73:18)
to dispel sort of the mystery as to why (73:15 - 73:21)
they're stepping down they're both 65. (73:18 - 73:26)
yeah they're all too yeah 65 is a (73:21 - 73:28)
retirement age as a person that was (73:26 - 73:31)
forced to retire recently early (73:28 - 73:34)
65 is retirement age you are kind of (73:31 - 73:37)
done working at 65 and you want to be (73:34 - 73:38)
done working it's not a great big (73:37 - 73:41)
mystery why two people who turned 65 are (73:38 - 73:45)
like and I'm gonna retire (73:41 - 73:45)
yeah there are a lot of the people who (73:46 - 73:50)
have been with the Pokemon company the (73:48 - 73:52)
Pokemon company International all of (73:50 - 73:55)
these places for a very long time who (73:52 - 73:58)
are starting to leave and things are (73:55 - 74:00)
starting to turn over to newer people in (73:58 - 74:02)
general but it does seem like this is (74:00 - 74:04)
not exactly one of those cases yeah I (74:02 - 74:05)
mean (74:04 - 74:07)
generally they will step down at the (74:05 - 74:09)
easier one to distract themselves from (74:07 - 74:11)
right like it is easier for me to turn (74:09 - 74:14)
over the reins and retire from one area (74:11 - 74:16)
and there's already a structure there (74:14 - 74:17)
and then we'll figure out the other one (74:16 - 74:20)
right like but the mystery is to oh my (74:17 - 74:22)
gosh why are they doing this because (74:20 - 74:24)
they're 65 and they want to be done (74:22 - 74:25)
working (74:24 - 74:27)
I wanted to be done working and I'm (74:25 - 74:30)
almost 53. (74:27 - 74:33)
now creatures which has one third of the (74:30 - 74:35)
Pokemon well about what we don't (74:33 - 74:37)
actually know what the split is (74:35 - 74:40)
um because you can't split 103 ways (74:37 - 74:43)
evenly uh so somebody has (74:40 - 74:45)
if it was even one of these three (74:43 - 74:47)
companies have 34 but we don't know what (74:45 - 74:49)
to split it we don't know if Nintendo's (74:47 - 74:52)
20 or 30 or 33 or 35 we don't know if (74:49 - 74:54)
creatures is 33 34 or three we don't (74:52 - 74:56)
know (74:54 - 74:56)
as I missed something but like (74:57 - 75:01)
um (75:00 - 75:03)
so creatures (75:01 - 75:06)
has made the 3D models for Pokemon games (75:03 - 75:09)
and back when they made the 3D models (75:06 - 75:11)
for X and Y the whole concept behind (75:09 - 75:13)
that was they were making 3D models to (75:11 - 75:16)
Future proof for whatever it's worth (75:13 - 75:19)
whether they have changed 3D models in (75:16 - 75:23)
the past if you look at the 3D model (75:19 - 75:26)
of Charizard in (75:23 - 75:28)
um sword and shield or in let's go (75:26 - 75:30)
Pikachu let's go Eevee and you look at (75:28 - 75:31)
him in (75:30 - 75:33)
scarlet and violet (75:31 - 75:35)
he's different they like changed his (75:33 - 75:37)
snout for whatever it's worth like I (75:35 - 75:39)
don't know how much work that was I (75:37 - 75:41)
don't know if that really matters uh but (75:39 - 75:44)
3D models do slowly change over time but (75:41 - 75:47)
initially they made them all in X and Y (75:44 - 75:49)
to Future proof them another example (75:47 - 75:51)
even though Mewtwo is not in the game (75:49 - 75:55)
yet Mewtwo's model is different like he (75:51 - 75:56)
is (75:55 - 75:58)
different than also Pokemon go uses the (75:56 - 76:01)
same 3D models as (75:58 - 76:03)
the other games right like there's a lot (76:01 - 76:05)
of Pokemon games might as well (76:03 - 76:07)
make them all look the same for (76:05 - 76:10)
consistency purposes and ease of use and (76:07 - 76:12)
so creatures are the the company that (76:10 - 76:14)
made the 3D models they also deal a lot (76:12 - 76:16)
with the Pokemon Trading Card Game (76:14 - 76:18)
um and how that works (76:16 - 76:21)
uh but they they they they do pretty (76:18 - 76:24)
much work on like every Pokemon game to (76:21 - 76:26)
an extent whether that is (76:24 - 76:27)
um (76:26 - 76:30)
the modeling or something else not (76:27 - 76:34)
credited uh so for example they they did (76:30 - 76:37)
they do make games uh no I know that is (76:34 - 76:40)
shocking uh so creatures was the (76:37 - 76:41)
developer (76:40 - 76:43)
on Pokey Park (76:41 - 76:47)
uh for we Pikachu's adventure they also (76:43 - 76:48)
were the developer on Pokemon Ranger (76:47 - 76:51)
Guardian Signs uh they developed the (76:48 - 76:53)
Pokedex 3D app for whatever that was (76:51 - 76:55)
worth uh that no longer accessible (76:53 - 76:58)
because the eShop is down also (76:55 - 77:00)
they didn't say anything to anyone on (76:58 - 77:02)
social media or in a newsletter or on (77:00 - 77:04)
their website to like hey this is last (77:02 - 77:06)
week to get eShop stuff that shutdown (77:04 - 77:10)
for 3DS and we you that's uh whatever (77:06 - 77:12)
that happens I think there was some news (77:10 - 77:13)
in Pokemon home (77:12 - 77:21)
[Laughter] (77:13 - 77:23)
for what it's worth and it may have been (77:21 - 77:27)
news after the fact but it's there (77:23 - 77:27)
uh they also creatures or is the (77:27 - 77:33)
developer on detective Pikachu (77:30 - 77:36)
for the 3DS (77:33 - 77:39)
um and who knows where detective Pikachu (77:36 - 77:41)
2 is because they're whatever the switch (77:39 - 77:43)
version because (77:41 - 77:46)
they said that that was coming (77:43 - 77:47)
um so maybe they're still working on (77:46 - 77:50)
that I don't think ishiyahara stepping (77:47 - 77:52)
down has anything to do with synthetic (77:50 - 77:55)
to Pikachu too uh yeah I think I think (77:52 - 77:57)
Greg is correct and you know he's just (77:55 - 77:58)
older (77:57 - 78:00)
so they do they do do it's not like (77:58 - 78:03)
creatures just sits there and doesn't do (78:00 - 78:04)
anything it's not like they just made a (78:03 - 78:06)
bunch of Pokemon models and were like (78:04 - 78:08)
well what are you in gen 10 will make (78:06 - 78:11)
another 100. (78:08 - 78:11)
there's a bunch of games I didn't list I (78:12 - 78:16)
just listed just a couple games but they (78:14 - 78:19)
they have worked um creatures also (78:16 - 78:21)
absorbed at one point (78:19 - 78:24)
umbrella which was probably the worst (78:21 - 78:27)
maker of Pokemon games ever if you don't (78:24 - 78:30)
remember what umbrella made uh they made (78:27 - 78:33)
Hey You Pikachu and they also made the (78:30 - 78:36)
hit game that lasted exactly one year uh (78:33 - 78:38)
which was (78:36 - 78:43)
Rumble Rush Oh I I whatever the I I (78:38 - 78:46)
don't remember Rumble Rush burst Rumble (78:43 - 78:47)
Rush Rumble (78:46 - 78:51)
uh boy (78:47 - 78:51)
I just Rumble Rock Pokemon Rumble Rush (78:51 - 78:57)
yes that's just what it was called on (78:55 - 78:59)
IOS and Android (78:57 - 79:01)
to just a side note just a little Cliff (78:59 - 79:03)
to people that were like (79:01 - 79:06)
Pokemon carries any brand and the only (79:03 - 79:08)
reason 96 is successful is because of (79:06 - 79:10)
Pokemon (79:08 - 79:12)
I just want to point out Rumble Rush (79:10 - 79:15)
that game didn't even that game lasted (79:12 - 79:17)
exactly one in Pokemon could the brand (79:15 - 79:21)
of Pokemon could not save Rumble rush at (79:17 - 79:24)
all nothing could be done to miss to (79:21 - 79:26)
save that game unfortunately there are (79:24 - 79:28)
plenty of Pokemon mobile games that have (79:26 - 79:29)
died (79:28 - 79:33)
yes uh Magikarp jump (79:29 - 79:36)
you know that game was still out there (79:33 - 79:38)
nobody talks about it so therefore it's (79:36 - 79:39)
dead (79:38 - 79:42)
I will I will believe magic Arc jump is (79:39 - 79:45)
a valid game when I see death threats to (79:42 - 79:47)
the makers (79:45 - 79:47)
well they are the ones who (79:47 - 79:52)
are making for one sleep yeah making (79:50 - 79:54)
them Pokemon sleep so we'll see they did (79:52 - 79:56)
look they did the correct thing (79:54 - 79:58)
and we actually don't know who's working (79:56 - 80:02)
on it one and done (79:58 - 80:02)
maybe we need more Japanese developers (80:02 - 80:06)
because then the Angry American audience (80:04 - 80:09)
will struggle to find them (80:06 - 80:09)
I feel bad for (80:09 - 80:15)
anyone making content (80:11 - 80:15)
it's rough out there (80:15 - 80:18)
um (80:18 - 80:20)
shout out to the people who steal my (80:18 - 80:21)
graphics and put their logo on top of (80:20 - 80:22)
