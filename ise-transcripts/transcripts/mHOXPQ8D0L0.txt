[Music] whoa what's up everyone welcome to the 460th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective my name is sbj with me is greg hello how's it going how's your weekend been let's talk about something that's actually relevant unlike the 25th anniversary of pokemon no relevance no relevance uh will also here i got something for you new midwestern cuisine i sampled this morning for breakfast what did you have the crispy puff ooh 30 calories i didn't i did didn't make me sick did you have five of them three of them uh everything comes in a three pack here at the uh at the hyvee um so for the uninitiated the crispy puff is very similar to what we in new york used to call uh funnel cake um other places i've seen it like an elephant ear i think excited no no no no no no no crispy puff crispy okay it is the the big difference is it's not fresh nah never fresh never fresh and it is covered in that very like thick like coarse granule sugar um and then this one has cinnamon yeah they often have cinnamon very very crunchy we went to brunch again we're getting back into normal swing we went back to brush again and they have a new it had a new menu item they had chickens and waffles which i had was very good new yeah on their menu they must be in the pokemon 25 spirit if they're vamping the menu their revamp of the menu they added some new they were like brett got like the best way to describe him is breakfast nachos yeah i mean nachos with two eggs on top and then some other it looked very good you know you could just have regular nachos yeah they didn't actually have the lunch they didn't have the lunch menu they only had the brunch menu and onset brunch menu was the breakfast not just now i want to get that true minnesota classic tater tot nachos [Music] i wonder if i know a place that has them don't you yeah i should say i wonder if psycho suzy's is still doing business but oof that place well speaking of places and that was my transition speaking of places not giving us anything we do have we do have some pokemon news uh i have a couple and we only really talked about uh pokemon snap last week we'll probably talk about pokemon snap again since i think we all played more pokemon snap uh will only played like two minutes last week so i've got it's not gonna be good it's not gonna be good i played i've probably played about five hours of pokemon snap it's still not gonna be good wait till we get there okay boy if you're watching the youtube version my room is a mess right now i'm in the process of uh redoing my shelves i'm adding more things it's like decoration says i'm cleaning when we started the video podcast my room was like nice and greg's was messy and now it has completely flipped greg's is very pleased that my room was in transition i have to rearrange my whole house because i'm now working from home permanently i can no longer pretend that i'm going to an office i have to actually set up an actual i'm just saying my room is now in transition and there was a time when people questioned whether i had any pokemon merch which now you can see now that i've moved to my new location i do have the uh the thailand pikachu three game boy picture frame with no picture in it i don't this is hard to orient the syndicate that steve got me as a gift one time uh up there is uh the flabebay uh i have little stuff there's a victini in there somewhere up in that mess but the obviously lots of monster hunter stuff so there you go i like your old office better will my old apartment was very nice and very expensive my new home is a dump but i'm saving a lot of money it's in transition sure someone said it's very similar to the pokemon 2015 series speaking of dumps how's the 25th anniversary going okay we got some decent news this week what what did we get i got the news i got it right here okay give it to me i'm ready let's start off with the pokemon code news i think we got we got two exciting announcements here but we got three announcements total which one is the done okay so i'm waiting to hear what the two exciting ones were all right so this was off pokemon go live dot com swablu community today featuring mega altaria appearing afterwards uh this will be this weekend uh may 15th from 11 to five suavelu will be appearing in the wild if you're lucky you may encounter a shiny one you can evolve swablu up to two hours after the event for an altaria that will know the attack moon blast uh there there's the snapshot feature will be turned on there's a special community box 1200 poke coins uh 50 ultra balls five incubators five incense and the elite fast tm for one dollar uh you'll be accessed the swablu community exclusive research called cotton winged bird uh cottonwood bird tickets are not live as of yet as of this recording uh mega altaria will make its pokemon go debut and mega raids at the conclusion of may community day on saturday april saturday may 15th at 5 p.m back in time uh this is your chance to catch me collect mega altaria energy to evolve any of the altaria you've collected during the event and then a 1 4 hatch egg distance will be available which is kind of a bummer uh because i'm pretty sure it still costs 400 candy to evolve saw blue yeah so i think it should have been double candy incense will last for three hours and we are still in the pandemic version of community which i guess we're technically still in a pandemic but it is why just turn on the make why why can't we have three hours why are they 30 minutes just turn on the three hours i have a question what if altaria is real but we just can't see them because they just look like clouds in blue sky so they're camouflaged i mean that's how they survived all these years who's hunting the altarias i like altaria apparently steve that's why i think i'll tear hunted to extinction that's a gen 3 pokemon greg yeah i like that a fan i'm a fan of altaria i'm saying that they are camouflaged because they've been over hunted they got a good shiny too they do have a good shiny maybe the shinies wait hold on what color is that shiny it's gold yeah they're getting picked off yeah the golden ones are like they're floating around in the sky like wait there's a gold thing now i'm going to figure out if i can do community day on saturday why where are you going on saturday oh couch being delivered he's got all kinds of stuff going on who doesn't get a couch on a saturday you get a couch on like a thursday so you tell your boss like i got a couch getting delivered can't be at the phone that doesn't work because like yeah you work from home so guess what how about you get a couch delivered when you're not on the clock because i have to take apart so here's the thing they aren't taking our old couch it's the whole thing i have to like set up the junk people to come and take our existing couch put it on your front lawn and put those free signs i am not you i don't live in florida on a junk lawn plus do you know how steep the hill is outside my house i would die taking this couch down that hill i'm going to hire professionals potentially as was suggested to be by my mother-in-law we should use the junk calling company and i quote college hunks to come get our junk uh hello this is what she gave to us uh greg leatherman yes that is the company i used i know i will give you the name of my hunks all right because guess what they was cute send me send me your hugs what about your marketplace you put on facebook marketplace you say free must pick up they create your door yeah that's that's insurance liability right there desiccated decimated destroyed couch like we're getting a new couch for a reason the old couch has completely fallen apart you messed up you should have bought the couch like a week before school started and then the college people are desperate for anything i'm not waiting until september to get a new couch it's been a year and a half it's just a garage you need me to be in minnesota there's a lot of things you're asking for right now i'm asking for my roof to be replaced which it is i need to get my entire garage fixed i need a new couch i need a new office which i've done i've set up my office for work look my life is complicated i have a lot of things going on unlike you mr streamer who has one thing going on sitting where you are 24 7 trying to get people to look at you what a way to put it there's not a lot of lies in that sentence [Laughter] there's no lies but suave luke me today this saturday yes uh i would say the temperature reading on this announcement was a little lukewarm tepid i i was almost of the opinion that we've already had a sua blue community today no we have not i think what you're thinking of is when we went to the go fest um two years ago swablu was one of the boosted pokemon i actually think that i'm just confusing swablu and dratini it was this one yeah yeah yeah but those the go fest where they had like the spooky area and then they had the muddy area and it was actually muddy not because they designed it to be muddy but because it rained yes um we had to have clear backpacks that was the third go fest because it was back at millennial park grant park because the first one was the failure second one was lincoln park yes third one was yeah so the the exciting news i guess and we need to talk about this because it's dumb is that they announced that the june community will be gibbel yes which is a pokemon that has that people have been asking for for community for a very very long time it's a pretty rare pokemon in the scheme of things so they didn't give any details about that they just announced that june i think it's june 6 we'll be gibbel uh for the most part it seemed that people were very positive on it but some were pretty negative so i just kind of want to talk about that baseball and the pokemon community were negative about a community today yeah so it seems that there's like this lose-lose situation that niantic is doing at this point because they took a pokemon that has uh been they took a pokemon that's pretty hard to evolve uh that's been shiny for a pretty long time you know overall not that exciting of a pokemon swablu is not a starter or blue yeah i like bluetooth but it's you know it's not a charmander it's not a squirtle and no that's it and then you take a pokemon that you know people j like people love garchomp uh people love the you know cynthia's associated with garchomp uh it's a incredibly rare shiny uh niantic whether they did it purposely or not made probably a lot of money off gibbel raid's last go fest because uh myself and a bunch of other people were joining one dollar giveaway raids to try to get a shining gimbal so like there there's definitely value in gimbal for sure uh and there then there's this there's this like weird mindset that i feel like we talk about once every three months where people feel like once a pokemon is more accessible their quote-unquote work that they've done to get that pokemon is devalued in some way um and this this is not exclusive to pokemon games uh i saw this a lot in destiny and i think will knows where i'm going with this there was a weapon in destiny called gallerhorn uh horn it was a very it was it was the best weapon in destiny for a while and there was no way to don't join this raid unless you've got gal horn no non galahorn's not welcome when when destiny first launched the second week of destiny they had a uh a seller cell gala horn and this was before a meadow was established in destiny and no one bought gallihorn because why would you buy a rocket launcher when you could get there was other weapons and why would you waste because you could only have one rare weapon equipped they were called exotics so no one wanted to waste their exotic slot on a rocket launcher and then ever since the raid came out people figured out oh this is the best weapon and there was nothing you could do to get gallahorn besides play as much as possible and hope that you got an exotic drop which was already rare and then hope out of that exotic drop that it was out of like the 50 exotics they had that that one was gallahorn and not a weapon you already had and so i i definitely remember the day that i randomly got gallerhorn to drop and i played a lot of destiny um and it happened and then what happened in the community was when you went to try to join a raid people were like you need to have to join it was specifically crota's end yes so they were set they were they were setting a requirement that you needed to either have been lucky enough to get this gun to drop or you have played so much that you are again at the end of the day still lucky enough to have this weapon to drop and they didn't care about your skill level they were just like you need to have this gun because you didn't need skill to use gal horn you just point and click point and click some people still struggled with that part of the game there was a timing issue and then to make things worse greg there was like this there was you'll appreciate this there was a point where the seller came back it was like a year later and he came back to sell gallihorn and the community took a darker turn and they said if you bought the gala horn you're not allowed to join the raid you needed to earn your gala horn to be an raid people who bought it this is online community stuff where the the user is apply always you could also you could also when you're like filling out the form on reddit or uh the destiny like group website that people made you could just be like i have it and then when you get there you like don't bring it out right like it was really dumb i earned it with money so i think this is this is the problem so not a break it was it was it was silly and this comes to the problem of pokemon where i think uh the people that are like uh suave community today why do a better pokemon there are plenty of people that don't have shiny swabless there are plenty of people who have never evolved in altaria because they're not hardcore players and 400 candy is a lot so you have these people being upset that now they're doing a community day for something to them feels like i already have this i don't want to do this why isn't it something new and then on the flip side you have gibbel and there are probably thousands of people with shiny gibble out there and they're upset because they feel like oh i spent all these money on raids or i played a lot more than you did and i have the shiny and now everyone is getting the shiny and there's this there's this conversation of like well my shiny is worthless now your daddy was always worthless but my question to these people is what was it worth yeah like like if if you had a 98 shiny gimbal that you you know spent a week in grinding you wouldn't have traded it anyways because the ivs would have rerolled so like you wouldn't have tr if i have something in my house that i never plan on trading or selling there's no price on that because i don't plan like no no one can make me an offer to get rid of it like it just it's not worth anything because no matter what you give me i'm not going to give it to you i could find a price i just checked i already have a shiny uh swablu so i'll be taking saturday off thanks do you have two because you need two oh so you got me so it's like this venn diagram and i think there's overlap of people being like i already have the sua blue and i already have the gibbel and they're in like this like weird position of they they just come off being extremely selfish of like well i don't want swat blue because i have it and i don't want gibble because i don't want you to have it and i just want something brand new and it's it's such a weird wait let me add a third circle that's my level of aggravation because in the first like two years of this game every other community day was a starter yeah and then we had a long break where like 2020 we we didn't do starters at all i don't think throughout any of 20 2021 finally april 2021 we're snivy i'm like i'm going to get my little tepig my cutie tepig that should be june it's not i mean typing in oshawa would probably eventually come i don't want eventually i want patterns patterns are important there there there is so the reason i think this is important to talk about is because like if if you are upset that gibbel is a community i don't know what video game you've been playing for the last five years but it is i i'm impressed that you are upset about this because like i am i'm shocked because if we look at if they did tratini right dirtini is the gibble of gen 1 they did um that hurts to say they did uh larvatar which i would probably say is the gibble of gen 2. uh they did shell gun bagon and shogun they did uh beldum like these are all pseudo legendaries that they have all done so why would they not do gimbal spoiler spoiler spoiler they're going to do dino eventually yeah and they're going to do gooby eventually and they're going to do dreepy avenge like like it is impressive that that that that people couldn't think that that was event like they were going to suddenly skip gimbal community one like they were like like you really genuinely thought they weren't going to do it i am taking issue with the fact that you're calling it impressive that people can get upset over a very predictable thing that they're going to get upset over there is like the venn diagram of fandoms is the middle where everybody's always mad about something mad about something yes because there is some level of bizarro gatekeeping that they are involved in that's now having these other people in that's ruining their special feelings or hurting their feelings like you're if you're if if if all you have in life is a shining gift and other people getting shot at gimbal is like crushing your happiness i would maybe advise trying to find other things in life that make you happy yes i mean i'm still here collecting all the shiny rosalia from my friends again i've been i've been lacking i'm going into home and collecting there are people who have been sending to me but look chinese are worthless they don't they don't mean i i mean theoretically they're not worthless if you're if you're selling them to other people but who yeah but don't sell pokemon team rocket that's just rude yeah pokemon puzzle it's against cos uh set up by team rocket uh but every pokemon is going to have a shiny release because every pokemon has a shiny you should be doing this not for the pokemon but for your own internal experience and reward and life lesson others people's happiness does not ever need to infringe on yours you can be happy on your own thing when you got it when you did and i guarantee you when you showed a person two years ago hey i got a shiny gibble they probably said oh cool i want one too i wish i had one and after this community today there'll be people who'll be like hey look at my shiny kibble like oh cool i have one too look let's share i like this pokemon the conversation changed the slightest bit nobody ultimately cares about your 98 or 100 shiny electronic code yes i i need a a psychologist a sociologist we have a wide range of listeners i'm sure there's someone in one of these fields i don't know which is the appropriate field to do an investigation of why in the 21st century we have come to a place where other other people being happy takes away from me i think that's always been a thing we just have the internet to share it now it's not pervading more pervasive okay okay yeah i mean again it's just that pokemon go will always have an artificial rarity they will always introduce things that will be rare like right now it like when gibbel first came out gibbel was impossible to find and the that go fest last year made him a little bit more accessible um and then he went back to being rare and he's in like 10k eggs and you know if you're if you i it's also hard for me to feel bad for so the other argument maybe would be like well i spent this much money on incubators or i did this many raids to get a shiny gimbal and now they're just handing it out for free which i also disagree with the like handing it out for free having somebody give an hour of their time or two hours or six hours of their time is not free um they they have a set window to go and do something and time is the only real currency this is true yes but again if you're to the point where you're spending 50 60 70 on raid passes or incubators where have you been for five years this game has not changed when it first came out it was impossible to find a dratini dirtini was very hard to find do we remember when they made marip the rarest pokemon in the world it is a sheep that you found on route like 207 or something and like they have artificially made pokemon rare and now when they did spawn marip like six months ago people were like oh look at all these marie blah blah blah like there will be a point where you will be sick of seeing dino well like right now dino is impossible to find in two years you'll be like i'm swimming in dino like it's just shocking that people are willing to spend so much money and then like bobby not pay attention to how like like it's not my niantic's not hiding what they're doing it's been very obvious what they're doing they pick why is a mogul rare no one cares about a moga they made him spawn for like a one in a hundred chance and then they took him away and he'll be back i'm sure oh i can't wait for a mocha community wait imoga doesn't evolve it can't be a community day dagger maybe they'll do a community day where it's all the pikachu knockouts they'll do a what generation did is is sinnoh is a molecule no uh how dare you they will have a unova ticket and it'll be shiny in the unova ticket now we're gonna get to november and it's gonna be pokemon's shocking 25th anniversary and it's gonna be all the electric mice variants oh yeah it would be the electric mouse ticket all the knockoffs uh okay we did talk about this last week obviously the last bit of pokemon go news here which i think is part of the exciting so i thought the out of the three pokemon the gimbal was exciting well you had three this is the third one the bad one was the slaw blue this is bad no i don't think so either i mean none of these are good all right this is exciting though mark your calendars pokemon go fest returns this july uh i have always loved gofest um last year's event debuted a brand new worldwide format that saw trainers from around the globe working together to complete challenges unlock rewards defeat team rocket from the launch of the global challenge arena to the thrilling research that led us to victini pokemon go fest 2020 was truly an event to remember what does this have event in store well you'll just have to wait and see 2021 marks the 25th anniversary of pokemon go the fifth anniversary sorry 25th anniversary of pokemon the fifth anniversary of pokemon go so uh we trust that you won't want to miss this go fest we cannot wait to celebrate another summer stay tuned for details um and then it just says the for more information about help and blah blah i remember not getting victini at the end of last year's go fest because you didn't log in that day yeah so we don't know price we know the dates july 17th and july 18th probably 12.99 something around there yeah the first one was 1299 right yeah or was it 14.99 no i think it was 12. i think it was 12. uh the mythical here is obviously mellowetta i know this is an audio podcast but uh when it says fest it is the green and the turquoise and then the like light the off-white and then there's little music notes it is literally melowetta's colors okay um plus the music notes kind of give it away yes uh so the mythical will be melowetta um i don't uh the don orange one the regular one i don't know what the regular mellow wedding form is called i think the orange one is called dance form though uh what's pirouette four and one something uh they show a scyther a merrell chess bin and a swoo bat in the picture and a pikachu i don't think there's any like hidden message here and pirouette for scythers s merrell's m p s m p c w s and p c w that's that's your hint no i don't know there's no i'm sure people have tried to figure out if picking scyther and meryl for this picture means anything i don't think so hogwater electric grass psychic oh wait pokemon has more than one type since when they didn't i i think it's probably safe to say or safe to speculate that it's going to be bare minimum exactly like last year in the sense where everyone buys a ticket and competes the question is are they going to have a physical location for some people and if they do opt to do that i don't what is the travel situation i don't think other countries can come here or because i know we like we as americans can't go to like japan so japan's not letting travis still off the books for pretty much everywhere uh you if uh so currently the cdc is saying if you are vaccinated you can travel domestically only so that means you could fly within the united states on a domestic flight as long as you're vaccinated the thing is is that most places still haven't opened a bunch of event spaces uh so you would have they would have to find a domestic location that is completely outdoors that has enough space space or not or just do what they did last year and just say it's global and i have a feeling they aren't going to try to do a central locale this close to things sort of being done so i will say the key here if you read the actual phrase on this very brief web page trainers from around the world are invited to participate in a special two-day pokemon go fest experience on july 17th and 18th if it was going to be at a location they would have said event so the one on pokemon go live it has different word words yeah what does it say there global event from july 7th wait no i'm looking at pokemongolive.com yeah mark first first line says event i that mine does not say event i would i would wait i would wager to bet they would want to try an event if they can um so and they would probably make it limited so i would say that that would have been possible if we had if things didn't look so dire six months ago because there's no way they could plan it within you know you know at the beginning of april for july and have that much time like that's a short window for things to have been released up they would have had to have started uh opening things up and started planning this well before uh well before things looked better for people being located in one central location i think yeah i mean i'm sure they have venues booked like like think of how many venues they they probably still have um uh yeah i don't know what the word is extensions on like like that they have that that they that we were supposed to go to they had that one in pittsburgh um i am sure there are still you know they have to eventually do that st louis event and that park probably has like okay we have uh august maybe if the august doesn't work out we have october if october doesn't work out we have you booked for i i'm sure something like that maybe exists because those parks slash cities want the tourists i think the bigger problem is not the space i think it's very easy to say like okay we got this huge park we're bringing in only 50 of the people we did last time so everyone's spacious wear a mask even if you're vaccinated i i think that's the easy part i think the hard part is you're bringing all people to a city and those people are going to go into restaurants and go into hotels and that is harder to control and niantic would feel responsible for that because they were there they're the people bringing everyone to the city uh even if it's like at you know half like when we when we went to mall of america i mean obviously you guys were just down the street i came out of town and even though and i got a hotel that was connected to mall of america and the mall was no i would say normally busy like uh i wouldn't say the mall that day was like oh like incredibly busy it was a little lighter than normal yeah yeah but the when we went into the hotel it it felt like i was at a convention like ever like i waited in line for 30 minutes um it like every like you had to wait in line to get up to your room because they were only allowing one person in um the elevator at a time and they had somebody managing the elevator if there it very much felt like i was at like a gen con where like there's too many people here and i just i can't even get to my room fast enough because i gotta wait in a line to get into an elevator like and that's what i would imag that's that i feel like is the problem with the physical go fest that the the fest itself the things around it of like waiting in line at a restaurant or the restaurant being too crowded or the hotel having a full lobby because people don't know where they're going or they're planning it's like but i would assume niantic would love to do the event for this because they love live events i just don't think i still feel they feel they have something to prove after year one right like week we can do live in person events and people love them so we're just gonna do it here it's july it'll be nice oh i'm still going to chicago i'm just going to pretend [Laughter] why would you willingly go to chicago you got to go once a year to remind yourself what awful place it is no you don't love the no service down this street i love it all right uh that's all the pokemon go news it was a lot this week but i think we covered it all we're going to take a quick break when we come back we got some anime news some tcg news and we're going to also talk about um pokemon snap so we will be right back up done abundance [Music] [Applause] dancers abundance

pokemon.com here but you know where to find ash and go battling and catching from kanto to galler with pikachu i'm going to skip the some of the pokemon they list here for spoiler purposes but pikachu will be there and uh go will have a certain pokemon as well uh the heroes will travel all over the world to research for research pokemon for cerise laboratory uh along the way ash climbs higher in the world coronation series rankings and go will add more pokemon to his pokedex in his journey slash quest to catch mew meanwhile chloe will take her first steps as a pokemon trainer when she meets a

the journey continues um but they do not have a date for when this series will continue but i believe it's done on netflix i believe the part four was the last part and that is good so if you've watched that you're all caught up um if you haven't watched it you have plenty of time you got pretty much probably all summer to catch up and then they didn't say that it'll be on netflix here i'm assuming i mean i thought somewhere else it said it's continuing on netflix but it doesn't say on pokemon.com it was poking around on hulu last night and there was some some pokemon anime on there yeah they have like seasons of something that's all i can't imagine that it's not on netflix why would they move it now like there would be an announcement that somebody got it if netflix wasn't it's like a free win for netflix they don't have to spend money making it yeah netflix has deep deep pockets and for scientific reference uh i believe although my research may be lacking uh there are 23 seasons of one piece so pokemon is is one more season running anime of all time how many episodes in a season of one piece though uh it varies oh mike oh my that is like too many season 19 had 107 episodes season one had 61. it's it varies pokemon and i keep restarting it and i get there's i get to one part where i'm like i can't with the yelling right now and then i forget where i left off so that i'm like skipping through this this is gonna be fine this is gonna be the most weebest thing that will be said all of this episode of it's super effective greg one piece is your bleach for me restarting bleach yeah over and over again look i also got we also got just a certain important part in bleach where we're like you know what we're out i'm just done i just can't anymore i i love me that zompacto is good uh also off pokemon.com the gallerian rapidash v box should be available maybe somewhere i don't know it's hard to find cards still uh valerian rapidashv is known for its devastating psychic attack uh it sends out from its long horn and now that power can be yours listener alongside a playable foil promo card featuring this pretty pastel pokemon uh plus an oversized card suitable for display you will find extra treasures and a handful of pokemon tcg booster packs chase down this forest beauty with the gallerian rapidash v box you're getting one promo card one oversized card and four booster packs i can't see the booster packs here i know one is one is battle styles it looks like one is darkness ablaze i can't see the other two uh they look okay though they don't look i don't see any steam siege or crimson invasion back there thank goodness who i don't know the card situation anymore at my targets they are you have to show up at a friday at 8 a.m i saw on twitter people taking pictures of their targets and it being like fully stocked like the old days like oh not 20. not my target not the one by my house 20 etbs and um 30 of these boxes and booster that's not my target uh so i don't i don't know what magical target they went to where it's like completely stocked but uh no not not me if yeah all my target has are well first okay right there's a left and right situation and i think most targets are divided in the same most targets i've been to are divided in the same way there's four there are four target layouts seeking as a person who lives in the target town there are four very distinct target layouts and yours will be in one of four well what i've always noticed is there's one half that is card games and such that people actually want so that'll be your mtv mtgs pokemon and yu-gi-ohs that'll be one side and then there's the other side which is like baseball cards weird like loot box type blind box things tiny things that nobody actually ever buys so that side is always full and then now at the target by my house uh still no pokemon no yugioh i think that might be someplace else in the store and then only mtg sets that nobody wants anyways my target closest to me the busiest target in minnesota is card bear there is nothing there are a couple of calheim super booster packs of magic the ones that nobody wants nothing else there's nothing left they are just bare shelves the next set chilling rains i didn't even see the standard online sites like troll and toad or cool stuff inc or what was the other one uh anyways i haven't even seen them put up pre-orders for chilling grains and now we're like a month away from it and normally uh like i pre-ordered battle styles which came out in march i pre-ordered that in no well that was amazon but i ordered battle styles off cool stuff inc for 120 which i normally have always paid 99 for we've talked about this um i ordered that in january and then but i ordered late like i think they put them up in december because they were already they were already sold out of etbs when i went to go order [Music] a booster box but they haven't put anything up yet and i i have a friend who works with a distributor because he sells cards and he said that like the allocation for chilling reigns was smaller than battle styles and battle styles was already smaller than like vivid voltage and darkness ablaze even though like three months ago they said we're ramping up production we're making more we understand people can't find cards i i don't know it's not it's still not fun still not fun to just collect pokemon cards at this point it's real rough it's dark days it'll pass soon money started going to start going into them nfts people won't want physical stuff anymore actually should we start a pokemon no i guess you could own you could own this for a second everybody if you want if you want some something let me just say get your ethereum wallet set up it's coming well tell me about your five hours of pokemon snap okay so here's the issue because even though yes number one love pokemon snap love playing it i have added it into my rotation of something that i play every single day but my love has taken a dark turn uh-oh because kim's only been out for nine days look things happen fast even though i love playing it a lot and like i will literally sit down and it's like because i have like my three games that i'm gonna do and like every time i sit down i play games i do a little bit of this one a little bit of that one a little bit of that one so pokemon snap is in there i really like chasing that meganium and i think i've chased the meganium probably 30 times now so of my five hours of play three hours is me chasing meganium two hours is daytime in the first park night time in the first park and probably 15 minutes of the jungle because i've gotten it finally gotten into the jungle i mean that's fine that's good i i repeated the park a lot after yeah that was like the first course i repeated over and over again to try to to try to like figure out the secrets i find the game to be so difficult and i'm like i'm gonna get it i'm gonna get it i'm gonna do it again and i'm gonna get it this time and then i don't get it all right i'm gonna get it uh i have an update about my controls it turns out because i've got a pro controller it's helped slightly but apparently my joy cons have developed the drift why i think i'm fighting i was fighting against them more than probably everybody else was um also i worked very hard to get my pride picture up completed and done so all of you listeners go to my snap page for june i have a pride picture up it is very important go support my happy pride photo on pokemon snap thank you one thing i keep having an issue with mentally is keeping in mind that the the circle selector is more important than the camera like so the left stick is more important than the right stick and the left stick should be on the pokemon that you're trying to take a picture of because i've had situations where i have like a ductless that is like smiling and its wings are up and it's just the happiest little ducklet but my circle was pointing at a swanna um professor mirror you need to get better glasses because your prescription's bad because you are clearly missing the thing first of all i can't get it more in the center second of all this thing is gorgeous i took a snap i took a screenshot of when i beat the game uh so there is no winning at this game it is a constant life devotion yeah so getting credits uh so for me it was uh five thousand seven hundred photos taken uh 27 hours and nine minutes and then the total pokedex score was 1.4 million um and since then i am up to 40 hours of playing and my pokedex score is at 2 million um and i think i'm at like 7 000 photos because i think you get like a little uh achievement unlock at 7 000. so yeah 40 hours in about 10 days uh i said this last week i'll say it again i'm glad i was wrong i didn't think this game would be longer than 10 hours and i am still like 19 pokemon away from finding every pokemon because i think there's like 214 and that doesn't even count getting one two three four stars of every pokemon that obviously doesn't count the 4k of everything there are some things that don't specifically matter but could matter to you in the sense of wanting to be a completionist so for example like there is every form of vivian in this game uh but you could just just say like well i just took four one two one two three four vivian and they're all 4k so i'm done there but there's like an achievement a title i think they're called or if you get all the vivian interlocks that so um even though that your album doesn't necessarily remember all 16 forms of 17 forms of vivian something like that does it also have pokeball form the pokeball form is in the game yes yeah every every form is even the fancy form all of them are they're like really hard to get uh i think we talked about this a little last week that snap is also a puzzle game and i have still at this point 40 hours in i haven't looked anything up um sometimes i i i guess i i spoil myself when i'm looking at other people's pictures like for example there's a picture of kangaskhan holding its her child up and then there's like a minior in the sky and it's like oh i've never got kangaskhan to do that and i bet that's the four star because that's what i'm missing so how did you so now that i like that spoiled for me but like there's still the puzzle of like how did you get minier here to get kangaskhan to lift up so like it's a spoiler but also it was like oh cool now i know how to do that um but i haven't gone out of my way to look up anything i i will say that the game [Music] the research tax i said it yesterday the last time and it confirmed it the research tasks some of the things that they asked for are the four star picture so that it will ask for a specific oh i've seen it do this see if you can get a picture of it it doesn't tell you that's the the len talk that picture that you're mentioning i know that that's a task because i saw it and i went oh i have no idea how you do that or where that what happened those are the things that keep me going back and back and back and it's like like the one of them was uh catch a photo of uh is it quagsire like quagsire jumping and it's like i i just got it i got it right down and there was a uh a beautiful eye like flying in from the side and quagsire is jumping and i was like yes i got it i got it but i'm on guard oh now that i'm like close to finishing the pokedex and i've seen credits and now i'm just trying to beat scores and stuff i am feeling that like grind in the sense of i kind of just want to look stuff up now like there are things in the game where ah i guess i guess the word is hard where like i don't i don't this game's not hard right like they're myself lies this game is real hard for me the game itself is not hard you could go through the entire game get nothing but like bronze star photos and you will see credits right like the if you want to experience the story which uh in the audio version i'm doing air quotes story because it like boy does that i'm learning about the illumina phenomenon and the mystery around maybe we'll talk about the story next week just to give people time to finish it but i got things 12 hours yeah or will anderson time 100 hours like if you just if you just want to see credits the game is easy there are things where you you have to be very precise and you have to do a lot of trial and error but the problem and i think this is what makes this is why some people might say like the game is hard the game doesn't give you feedback you don't know what is working or not working without just trial and error and sinking time in 100 i don't think i don't think that's like i don't think it's i don't know if fair is the right word uh but i remember when travis was on the program he was talking about uh they were talking about a specific kind of tv show oh gosh what was it uh but their their example was like no it was a podcast it was um it was one of those audio dramas kind of like welcome to night vale and and he and they said specifically the show is only mysterious because they're purposely holding out so much information yeah yeah and that is the thing they're using against you where is if they said one or two things it would make sense but the only reason the mystery is there is because they're withholding a lot of information and they give it to you later to be like oh my gosh didn't you never would have thought of this and it's it's this weird trope and ever since they said that i always thought about it of like you kind of see through the facade that they're putting up yes this is called uh death note plotting right here so we're i'm watching an anime that is doing this exact thing and luckily the anime is still really good but i'm getting to the point in the anime which is so what i was reincarnated oh i was reincarnated as a spider so what it's fun but they withhold a major point of information for 12 episodes and then when they finally reveal it you're like well no wonder nothing was making sense like you you needed to tell us this up front because i we've been literally sitting here going what is even happening in this show it just doesn't make sense i actually appreciate it in in pokemon snap though because when i have those moments of oh let me just like fidget with the buttons and wait i'll do a scan i'll throw a fluff through oh wait something happened and i'm like oh something happened okay okay i'm gonna go through it again and remember to do it on purpose next time well i always forget that certain ones react only to the scan sound yeah you got you got to hit that scan yeah but you you start to get a spider web in the jungle i keep going too far and i don't turn around to get back to it but you you start i i feel like at least for me it it doesn't become a fun mechanic and i think at the end of the day games need to be fun for you to want to go back like the loop has to be fun and good and it is but then there's like a point of frustration for example in the snow level there's two stoms and i can't get good pictures of them and i know you can get good pictures of them i can only get like bronze one star pictures of them and i see them and it's a very short window and i know that something needs to happen and i've gone through the snow level a dozen times and i cannot figure it out okay and the game doesn't give you any feedback which is this is the problem like there is nothing you can do well i i guess there are things you've got to solve that mystery so this is the thing that that i sort of discovered because spoiler spoiler spoiler i know the two numb that you're talking about it's at the bottom of you go down the hill and then there's a there's a hill there there is as i was flying down the hill and hit the scan button there are a number of them hidden in the tree there's a thousand that you fly past and i'm like well stop i need them i need to i did you never told me at all that there's a one there's a tree that i'm flying past and two that there's things in the tree because i had to use but of course there are of course there are but there's a lot of things that there's a lot of trees in this game that don't have anything in them i think that until you've gone and raised your research level and the pokemon like you more and then they start to show up i mean there weren't any bouffalont in the daytime of the park at the beginning until you were away across the metal they were way in the background i'm assuming that the developer probably made some obscure or or what not is because they want they wanted their customer they wanted the players to have these conversations and i appreciate that a ton i just wish that the game gave a little bit more feedback or the game realized that you went through this level 20 times and that it maybe suggests things for you to do or try they kind of do that up front like um what with will what will was saying uh but if you miss those like i don't is there a summary can i go back and see all the things oh no no no you actually have to pay attention and read when people are talking to you but like if i if i accidentally did something like um i don't know made clawlets or shoot a very powerful hydro pump if i accidentally did that and that was one of the tasks there is no again there's no feedback to be like oh you did this and this and clawlitzer did this like there's no summary i can go back to see like how did i do this activation how did i make this pokemon do that and i don't think like this is not a this this is like a down this is like a complaint for like if you are in the hardcore pokemon snap situation like it everything before this is still a hundred percent worth it but there is again going back to the snow level there there is a point near the end where there's like a sphere that is like floating on a lazy river and if you just happen to hit him at the certain point with an apple he stops and then a swine nub will cross over him he'll cross he'll use this field to cross over the river but then the swine nub doesn't do anything but then like why is that swine up crossing the river to get to the other side right obviously and then there's like a little um like air burst coming out of the ground so you're like okay i gotta get the swine up to do that i'm assuming i gotta get the swine up to do the air burst but when you're doing when you're doing that level like 12 times at a certain point you're just like what is the solution you know yeah this is just like to me it's very almost like a throwback to 80s video games where it's like the difficulty was just in discovery when discovering them that's at the end of the level yeah so you have to go through that like that is the challenge like each level that level in particular is a little bit longer which is cool some levels are shorter some are longer that one's a little bit longer it's like three minutes even if you decide to skip everything and hold the r button to zoom past you're not going that much faster so you're like instead of waiting three minutes you're waiting like a minute 40. and then you have to be precise and if you mess it up there's the ending and guess what you got to do it again that's what you gotta do and this sounds like a complaint and i guess it is a weaker part of the game but your your only other solution at that point is okay just go to serbia and look it up uh i will say that in i got that level of frustration in getting my pride picture because the solution isn't obvious like there isn't an obvious solution to how to make that event happen and i ended up looking it up because i'm like i am i have done this course 10 times now and i have checked everything that i can possibly look at i have scanned every section that i can possibly scan and i am not finding it i just cannot find the solution and i looked it up and it is so it is so precise that has to happen at such a precise moment that if you miss it it you just have missed it you you have to know that it's there and stuff i i don't know how you stumble upon that uh i think it's okay to look things up i think yeah i think yeah i think it totally is it's a throwback to like being on the playground with your friends and being like hey did you get this thing in in pokemon snap and you're like no i didn't figure that and they're like okay so this is what you got to do and then you're like get so excited because your friend finally told you like that thing that they figured out well my friend of the internet tells me a lot of things that's that's where we are right 2021 yeah right it's not i mean it doesn't look like avenue school in 1984. anyway once you know the solution it's it's like knowing a puzzle like once you know the solution you have it um and it's it's why it's kind of hard to yeah you have to execute it but it's kind of like playing portal twice like the first time you play portal you're like oh my gosh this is amazing and then the second time you play it you're like well i know the solution right like yeah but i still played it six times because i really yeah yeah um yeah i mean part of it is also that like even if you know the solution sometimes getting the game to do what you want because the aim the aim system and the physics system is weird those those the illuminati balls i feel like are perfect the i feel like are are they don't they they are locked too early they fall off quick quick for me you've got to like you've got to like have the pokemon out of the frame to aim it so it goes far enough and then it's like that whole mechanic of i think they're both they both react slightly weird and they both are different from each other like they did add weight to the fruit because it does have fruit it would have weight as a physical object um but having to do things where you are using the exact same targeting system for two things that have two different physics gets a little frustrating sometimes because it's like i have to not only try to get this apple exactly where you want me to do it but then i have to switch over to get the orb and it's run off of a different physics and i have to try it it can be i like that they have two different things like i don't think that's yeah i don't think it's a problem i think it's it is it is one of those things where it is much like older games you have to learn how to control the game by playing it over and over and over again and i do get i do not games where it's like you're teaching me how to interact with your game in a way that only applies to your game and hey we haven't looking for life lessons from pokemon snap they don't even teach us how to do already photographs in the uh on the other side of the coin there i there's a mythical pokemon i don't want to spoil what the mythical is there's a mythical pokemon in one of the end levels and they appear right at the beginning and the first time i saw them i took a picture of them and then i didn't see them for the whole level but i was like cool i didn't know they were in this level they just showed up i don't think i did anything particular for them to show up and then the second time i went through and i threw an apple at them and they didn't do anything and i got a better picture that time and then the third time i went through the level i was like i'm going to throw the illuminati ball at them and i did and they did something different and i was like cool and that is the sense of discovery the game is like trying to do and i appreciate that yeah and when it happens it happens in multiple levels that's right the sense of discovery i think is such an accurate way to describe it right because the first time you do the meganium level meganium's alone the second time you do it there's somebody with meganium and it's like it's a pokemon i absolutely do not care about one wit but the minute the level started and i was like wait there's another dude here that's having fun and doing other stuff i'm like oh this is amazing they do sense of discovery very well and then um so when i when i hit that mythical with a pester ball then they appeared later on the level oh alumni ball they appeared later on the level and kinder gentler future please and so i hit them with a pester ball again and they did something and then my thought process is i'm missing something and my thought process is i'm missing something here because i they're not close enough to me i'm missing the four star picture i got the one the two and the three they're has to they have to do one last thing i know where they are in the first area i know now how to move into the second area there must be a third area before the level is over for them to move and so fast forward to my seventh time playing the level for this pokemon i figured it out um oh i figured it out earlier it was just execution of like i bet i have to light up these crystals and now if i light up these crystals that mythical is going to go from the second area to that final area where i'm gonna get the four star shot and i did that but they appeared way later than i expected them to appear so i wasn't ready and my back was turned to them so i i turned around i was there well i didn't know where they were going to appear right so now i have to go through an eighth level to do that and again i don't think it's hard it is time consuming and that that journey was fun um this is what we used to love about games yeah yeah nobody better turn over them to perfect them we didn't know there was a better life for us in the future we were dumb kids but i i think that i i think again this sounds like i'm complaining and it's not i think it's just talking about like this is the this is the end game like the end game is you're either you're either two types of player you're you're either one or or two or maybe you're a mix but you're either i'm going to just go to cerebe and i'm going to look up every interaction and then i'm going to execute or i'm going to be this player where i am going to do discovery and i'm going to just try to discover everything but i think a problem with that second player which i am right now the problem with that second player is there i don't think there is enough time in the in the in the week i don't think there's enough time in the month where you can do this and still have your sanity because if because i don't know if there is a single player out there in pokemon sword and shield that figured out yeah mask without somebody telling them or without going to serbia who figured out yeah mask how to evolve yeah mask into um not coffee regis uh into roone right without looking it up like there there has to be a certain point where you're going to start looking stuff up and i think that's okay i think that's totally fine um but i think that the if as long as you like that sense of as long as you're still having fun with the sense of discovery and as long as you're dedicated to trying to complete the pokedex i think you will really enjoy the post game i think most players and i think i think most players will probably get to credits they will probably try to beat some high scores they will probably try to finish their pokedex and they will move on and the reason i've i have established everything up to this point is because like every video game that comes out the conversation is always do you think there will be dlc uh and i just don't know if that is what one i don't think dlc is needed for every game two i'm not a hundred percent sure what dlc would be adding more violence uh because the thing about the more islands is they do such a good job in this game of making you go to an island and then making you come back to a different island where they added something new and then making you go back to that new aisle of that island you were just at again like at a certain point the game's like oh we opened up three spots pick which one you want to go to and you're kind of like it's it's like a good overwhelming feeling of like oh i got three spots to go to while i want to go i want to do this one once and now i want to go to this one but i'm going to do this one twice because it was so fun and then like when you get the credits they open up another area like the the amount of areas in this game is incredible this game is going to take me forever yeah like the first pokemon snap had six levels one version of each level i'm sorry maybe seven because the mew level um no alternate paths and you just did it this is like 11 areas and every area has a day and a night or an evening and um there's like there's different routes like the game is a million percent to me worth the 60 dollars but as for the as for people being like is there going to be dlc i think the the thing that holds me up on this is it sure any game can have dlc but the thing i think holds me up is there is so much content here how can you even think about dlc yeah i mean that's not a difficult thing like there is so much content here and i'm enjoying it i can't wait to see if they have more i but i don't think most people are going to even come close to finishing it like think about you need you need 800 photos to complete this and well that's not even considering you need 4k i wouldn't people have gotten the credits and they have finished the game no all stars for all pokemon minimum because you don't need to fill out all four if you if you play 12 hours got two credits and then stop playing and go i wonder if there's going to be a dlc like what where where i i guess i i can't where's the disconnect like why are you not playing levels like or do you just want are you just looking for new maps and new pokemon like there's who knows ask them no i mean i do but like when you when you beat the game you're only at like 140 pokemon like they're like i'm 40 hours in i'm still missing 20 pokemon so if the if the drive is like i don't care about getting perfect score i just care about new pokemon like that there's no one is beating the game at 214 pokemon no one is doing that i mean people have no no you have to beat the game to get the mythicals to appear yeah so no one is getting credits and having a complete policy you have to get credits and then you have to go back and find another 40-some pokemon and i i we we know this we know that when people play video games not all people but the majority of people when they see credits they feel accomplished they feel done they move to a different game and that's fine that's normal like not every pokemon player in the world is a shiny hunter not every pokemon player in the world is going to grind the battle tower when they beat sword and shield they go through their journey they get their eight badges they see the credits and then they they hop back on fortnight um and they feel like that game is a valid 60 of their time speaking of uh yeah my watch has now confirmed that we have discussed pokemon's news pokemon snap more than we talked about omega ruby and alpha sapphire i mean it's because i wasn't on the show i would talk about those two games forever in the sense of like i i just think that the game has so much content that most people and maybe i'm wrong most people will not seek out because they're just done with the game but for the people who want to try to get all 800 pictures or even take that further get all 800 pictures at 4k that is a long game and i think a very very small percentage of people are going to do that so i'm not seeing where the dlc fits in i just it's just i people who don't care about the getting all the diamonds but they just want more courses i mean i'm i'm still playing the game i'm st haven't gotten the completionist and i'm thinking oh if they could do dlc for this that would be fun it's having other other areas that i don't have to go through we need fourth or fifth or eighth time but do rosalia roserade level even if those are the only three pokemon in the entire level i'm there for it i'm paying a high medium yes like i don't i think you i think you think the desire for dlc is based out of boredom from the game and that is not often where dlc people's dlc wishes come from a lot of people's dlc wishes come from i really like this game i want more of it i have this package it would be great if there were also more islands that came later or more but i'm saying if if you're if your desire is i want more stuff i'm saying there is more stuff after the credits there's it's a different kind of stuff right because like with breath of the wild you could whatever defeat ganondorf or whatever and like not want to go and find all the cracker rocks but you'd still want dlc because you're just like i want more adventure right people want dlc for different reasons like yeah i still haven't gotten all of them i'm still going back to these courses and saying i want to see what's new here but i would also like a new course a new area a new library courses are being given to you after credits which i've been to i still want the dlc yeah even though they do those you still want more pokemon that the x version of this one place that i've been to is a new course it technically is but i it's not a new necessarily new biome completely new biomes don't open up there's not like a swamp area that has suddenly appeared in the middle of every everywhere they could do a swamp they could do a a perfect garden there are things in a dlc that i would want in addition to the already enjoyable experience i'm having with they could insert new pokemon into the existing pathways and that would i mean they could i i guess i'm just on the side that they made a complete game they did it is yes and that that more more of a good thing if you want more after the credits i am assuring people who maybe are on the fence that there is plenty to do after the credits that having more to do after the credit still doesn't negate a desire to have a dlc remember a new home that was a desire to have it did not need 18 sequels okay desire to have still money is for people that are like i want more yeah i want and there is more after the credits i still want more than i i know that there's a i know there's a cap of 214 i want 300. i want 500 i would like more added these two things aren't as polar opposite as you'd like to make them out i am enjoying it i feel like i feel like it's like these rounds it's like a green camera like it's like it's like the people that are like i want chinese in the game because and then the the only justification they could be like is i want chinese in the game and the only reason when you say why is because they go well i want more replayability like you what the only people that you're talking to let's talk about confirmation bias of the conversations you have there are a wide variety of people have them yes some people are like i want more replayability because they have done what they consider enough for the game they got four pictures of the quality that they care about and they would like to see something different that doesn't match up with what you think you want to get the 4ks it's important for you to have 4k pictures all four all perfectly done that's important to you that doesn't mean it's important to this other person it's definitely not as important to me i am not on a 4k hunt i would like to get four four pictures in each i don't care about the quality because the quality is already weirdly sp i don't agree with professor beer as it is he can he can just take his opinion and go elsewhere i i want to do these interactions i can still want more i can still say i really like this game and i would like more of it i would i would it's saying i would pay for a dlc because yes it's a complete game and if i never got a dlc i would be happy but i also wouldn't turn away from a dlc coming yeah i'm not saying i would put away from a dlc coming the thing that makes me happy in this game isn't even the taking the pictures it's seeing pokemon running around and making noises in a natural environment and you're like this is what the pokemon that's why i ride down these paths and try to unlock new pokemon and new things so i can see them running around and doing stuff the pictures are like yeah of course you have to do it or else you don't get to unlock the stuff yeah i would like to see more biomes i want to see more pokemon i would like to see more pokemon in their natural habitat sue me they gave me 214. i would like to see the natural biomes and activities of all nine hundred yes i think i am coming from a situ like you're saying that's what it is i think people want things i think people are greedy and they and they don't look for what's already there because maybe they can maybe they come off as lazy but uh or or or they just they they want a specific thing but in this sense you beat the game right you get credits however long that takes you eight hours 12 hours 20 hours and there are still probably for most people 50 plus pokemon to find um and some of those pokemon are locked behind beating the credits like the mythicals and let's say you don't care about getting all the pokemon well but you're asking for dlc well the dlc is adding more pokemon and for some reason you don't want to get the 50 that you're missing so that that that's the disconnect for me and i think that's a fair disconnect right like if if you're asking for dlc because you want more pokemon there definitely is more pokemon after the credits there is but not necessarily pokemon you care about yeah where's my term wait is it um that completes some of your disconnect there are pokemon that aren't in this game that i would like to see in this game i would like to see them in their natural habitat they aren't in the 50 that come after i don't care about the 50 that come after i care about the ones that i want the other thing is like if somebody's like well i'm looking for replayability and i want to play like in the case of like well i want chinese because i think chinese will add replayability um i i like the replayability is there you're just ignoring it like getting 800 photos of pokemon doing different things is a huge amount of replayability and i am confident that most people will not seek to get 800 photos it's a lot of work your version of replayability is completing this task no way there's other things no because you're not you're not listening i am making different things i am naming different things you can do after the credits you can complete your pokedex that's huge you can get 800 photos that's huge you can get 4k on a bunch of things that's huge you can get top course courages scores that's huge you can have the leaderboard that's huge that is so much from the game and my problem that my problem is there's so many things you can do and people jump to dlc right away and it's frustrating because they're ignoring all of that that exists right it's it's like when let's go pikachu let's go eevee came out and that day in my chat or the day on twitter or the day in slack people are like what's the next pokemon game yo this game just came out six hours ago and we're already looking at the next pokemon game i think sometimes the dlc conversation is frustrating because they're ignoring everything that is there and they're all they're already looking for the towards something for a nine-day old game like there is so much to do and i named five different things you can do after the credits so no it is not me hanging on the fact that i only care about 4k or i only care about the 800. i named a bunch of things that you can do this game i didn't say that that's what you're hanging on there is replayability your you what you say is repealability somebody may somebody else might not see it what you keep saying is the amount of time or they're looking ahead or people want the next thing people have always wanted the next thing because they get very excited about a product and they go out and are super excited about this was so great and wanting something to come what the next thing is wondering what the next thing is isn't a way of saying i'm done with this thing is that this thing excited me so much i'm excited for what else they can do and i'm expressing my desire to have more of it what i get frustrated you're saying is oh they're greedy or they're not appreciating what they want because what you're saying is by wanting something the next thing or being excited about the next thing or asking do you think they'll be just uh there'll be dlc and what you keep expressing is that is them saying this wasn't enough and i don't agree with that argument i think in a lot of for a lot of people it's saying this was so great and i'm very excited as to other things that can come and be added to this game i was so happy with sword and shield i am excited for what the next generation is i want to know what it is because this was such a fun experience i'm still playing this game i am still playing a lot of sword and shield i'm still doing a lot in there that doesn't stop me from thinking and wanting and being excited about what will they do next i think the death of a fandom the death of a game series is when people stop being excited about what will become next because the current thing failed so bad when people aren't saying what else are they going to do because this was so much fun and gave me so much joy when they stop thinking i don't care about what comes next your game and your franchise is dying because you no longer have excited people and i think where you come from is you have the same conversation a lot and it's frustrating because you are still enjoying this one thing and i would argue that people's excitement for the next thing is based from the excitement of the thing that they are playing and loving and are very into right now they aren't such desperate thoughts they aren't so away from each other because this thing enthused me about playing this game i want more i really love this and i want more i know that it takes seven months to get a dlc and i will tell you right now seven months from now i will be tired of running these courses i will be over doing all these things and i know that in seven months if a dlc came out and gave me new things it would pull me right back it's the same thing with animal crossing people knew the holidays were coming that didn't mean they hated what they were currently doing but they were excited to see what they were going to do with the upcoming holiday they were excited for that thing coming because they were excited by the product now this excites me i want more i can't wait to see what they do in the future this is not such a strange path and i don't think what often i think your argument is or what your feelings are is that they are somehow dissing or disliking or ragging on the current thing or saying it wasn't enough i don't think a lot of people are saying that it wasn't enough i'm saying that that a lot of people are very excited by what they got and are excited for more i would say yes to abbreviate what greg just said hope for the future is not reprobation of today i think what i don't express enough is that how wrong you are and how right me and greg are yes that's true that's why i bring up these harder conversations because you you guys never well that's not true never not agree you sometimes you guys agree with me sometimes you don't usually usually one of you two agree with me and then the other disagrees it's always like a two verse one on this show yeah um that's the way it goes but i i do admit that i always think logically so when when somebody says like oh i would like dlc for this game i'm not thinking of like so in that past argument i just had i'm thinking there is enough in this game already and most people won't experience that i want bandai namco to not work on dlc because i want them to work on another pokemon game that is yeah that is that is theoretically what i am thinking that next game is your dlc no it's what you wanting to know he wants them to work on a not snap yeah but you know i i think you can work in another game i know that game so so no it's more of like if they work on dlc i i i don't think it will sell as well as people give it credit for because uh because there's there's more than enough there and if if those people are not willing to do the more than enough there and i named the multiple things you can do after post game they're probably maybe not willing to get that dlc and so if they're going to spend seven months to sell a 10 dlc which is relatively short and not a lot of people will buy i'm just thinking like what if they spend that seven months on a pokemon ranger or a galaxy and i feel like sometimes that gets lost where like when people are like i want dlc i'm more i'm more thinking like we have a complete game right here i've got it and what if what if bandai and namco worked on just a different game that we could get but you're you're talking about bandai namco can only do one thing at a time and you're also ignoring from a company what return on investment is a company who can put out an additional to a project that of an already established built game they don't have to build it from scratch the turnaround time of building more levels on an already existing channel a game and set of rules and guidance and art that takes way less time so there's an investment of a team working on something for four months they may sell it for ten dollars and get half the sales but the amount of time that they spent making on it plus the amount of profit they get is well worth making that dlc that's not necessarily true otherwise every game won't have dlc i'm not saying it's necessarily true for every game that is a that is a decision that companies make where but to say that it to say that they're going to take resources from making a brand new game away from if they can determine that the return of event is great for a dlc they're gonna make the return on investment thing that makes them the most money and if that's a dlc they'll do it because it makes sense it is easy to add on to an existing property for some things especially if in this new world most companies are aware that dlc sells and they will build things into their game to be able to add onto the game later like that is part of a new development cycle for video games so i don't agree with the idea that working on a dlc means something else is pushed down the line that is a internal company decision and they would have already made those plans basically but i don't agree that like working on a dlc is going to get their money back or is worth the seven months or is worth like the investment but we don't see their profits right we don't know what their return on investment is but there are plenty of popular games like final fantasy series and final fantasy 15 had plenty of dlc we know that game sold incredibly well and they canceled the deal they cancelled after two dlcs like they were supposed to have four and they only did two and so like in that situation we know that square enix is incredibly successful we knew that final fantasy 15 sold incredibly well um and like and the dlc maybe didn't sell that well so they canceled the other two dlc right they did that was a return to investment but the projection for return on investment based off of sales was these were going to be great and they started on that path and when the return on investment when they realized that they were putting more resources towards something that wasn't returning the profit that they had expected but again they built final fantasy 15 to be able to have dlc and they that didn't stop them from from making two more expansions and patches to final fantasy xiv it didn't stop them from making a ton of other games they had resources set aside saying hey if this sells this is our return on investment on something that is easier to make i don't know about final fantasy 15 that game was in development wait wait wait let me let me see if i can put this into terms that are less uh final fantasy oriented listeners so we're okay here it's an analogy right oh god so we're eating a delicious cupcake pokemon snap delicious vanilla cupcake with frosting and greg is saying i'm halfway done eating this delicious vanilla frost cupcake with frosting please baker make me another cupcake same vanilla cupcake it was delicious let's put some sprinkles on it all right and i will be happy if you do that for steve is saying i am going to eat this entire vanilla cupcake and in the time because greg's not going to finish the first one he's you know he'll get as much through it but he's going to once he sees the sprinkles he's going to jump on that steve is saying i'm going to take the time and i'm going to eat this entire vanilla cupcake and while i am doing that baker you are so good this vanilla cupcake was so great please make me a chocolate cupcake and i will attempt to enjoy i will take the risk now all of the risk is on the baker right because the baker can only make so many cupcakes at a time maybe they can make another vanilla cupcake because they've already got the recipe and toss some sprinkles on it right or maybe they can only do a chocolate cupcake maybe they can do both we'll see fi both we'll see in time but the thing to remember you both enjoyed the original vanilla cupcakes yeah that's never been in question what you want for the future it's your perspective of what you want for the future but it doesn't take away from what you originally were eating and enjoyed in your own way of eating it and enjoying some people don't even like frosting they only eat the cake and they toss the frosting aside and yet that cupcake was just as good for that i live with that person i will say i i have never cited on loving dlc and either there there's a lot of people that there are there are people that agree with me in the sense of like you you see the complaints of like oh this is probably cut from the game so they can sell it for dlc or or whatnot or this dlc wasn't nearly as good as the main game or um they do like and this is the industry they do this thing where they like sell you the game for 80 because you're going to get the dlc at a later date final fantasy 15 was a game that did this you could either buy the 60 game or the 80 game and get the four promised dlcs but there wasn't four there was only two um and i have never been that person right i have never been the person that says i want the collector's edition with all the dlc because even though i'm saving 10 bucks or whatever i don't know if i'm going to get there i don't know if i'm even going to finish the base game why would i buy content that one doesn't exist yet and two i don't even know if i'm gonna enjoy so in the sense of that i have always just bought the base game and if i liked it enough and i wanted more than the dlc is there but also i have felt that the dlc that i've gotten is really never as good as the main game and kind of mostly disappointing like i kind of thought that the dlc to fallout 3 was not great and the dlc to fall out new vegas also like and didn't look appealing to me and that's totally a choice right like there are some people who love fallout and love the dlc and stuff um how did you feel about crown tundra and isle of armor i thought that was i i that dlc blew my expectations away honestly um like they were they were definitely there were definitely expectations and the dlc that i've had i'm the person that will if it's a series that i absolutely adore and i know that i more often that 90 percent i will love the experience that they show me i will buy everything up front because i know that i will have it when i want to get to it and i i am banking on my past experiences with the series to say this is good enough to buy now at the very least you know you're going to want to touch it right i'm going to want to touch it now we can it's a separate conversation about businesses putting out half-baked games with dlc like there is there is a crappy level of of pressure and game design that exists about like and that's a completely separate conversation that i don't think applies to snap and i i do want to stress that like some games do feel half-baked and then like a lot of people thought that for sword and shield and they thought that the dlc maybe should have been included i just want to stress that i think pokemon snap is a full 60 a million things to do kind of game so i think it's a separate conversation to have about the state of the industry and dlc as a completion to a game or putting out half half done games knowing that dlc will come later like that whole conversation is is a very complicated situation that i don't think is we don't have the time or expertise to do right now but i don't think i think you need to learn how a company approaches dlc to know how they approach making games and i think when you see a company that starts to feel like they are short shorting their a game to go out to do dlc later that you should re-evaluate to that game i think that's a different conversation than what we're having here yeah i mean if we want to look at bandai namco's dlc for pokken tournament it wasn't great it was real bad honestly yeah but twenty dollars for two characters i would also argue that falcon tournament wasn't great when it came out like you either really really loved it or you got what you're gonna get out of it and you were never gonna go back for those additional characters and their dlc was aimed towards the people who absolutely allure that loved that game and they went in knowing what the over under of doing that like we can't see their internals but working in a massive company they have done the calculations about how much they're going to invest and that run the numbers about how much they expect to get back i should say that like balancing two characters in a fight a game is it's complicated very complicated to make sure that that feels good and they fit with the other roster that exists and they don't overlap into potential but stuff like there's a stuff but every there is not a single large corporation in the world that doesn't look at the resources they have do the forecasting of the return that they're supposed to get back and make that call to say yes pull the trigger no don't right and i i would be shocked if snap didn't sell incredibly well and i would be even more shocked if they didn't have a conversation about dlc absolutely did they absolutely did but again we can see that in cases of final fantasy 15 where most likely purchases of the dlc were underperforming and so they stopped like they had a forecast they had a a window that they said this is acceptable and when it fell below they stopped like that is how companies work and there have been situations in pokemon where it seemed like there should have been as maybe a pokemon z yeah and where did it go they didn't do it probably development who knows what happened and it's hard to say in the new new world that we're in because nothing is gotten back to normal business practices so we don't know if you know the team that made snap may be able to work in the office and they have all made arrangements to keep going and a team to do new things is still scattered to the winds and so they're like well let's get a quick good hit out because we have this team built we don't have to restructure and they can all work in one location like there are a lot of factors that go into it that we just can't see right now but we are in an unusual work situation anyway what's next one of the week all right boy so last week's pokemon i forgot to write down so once again i remember i just i get to say the bad one then because i didn't write it down i gotta i gotta hear it but i i think i knew what it was i'll just read it again because i literally gave it away in the fourth not word but whatever of the clue out of my 659 instagram followers one recently commissioned a digital piece art piece by calgarian corsola of themselves as a pokemon gym leader in snow point city even though the current snow point gym leader is ice type the picture depicts my follower as a normal type gym leader this week's pokemon is not featured in that drawing this week's pokemon is one of the first three pokemon to appear when you begin playing the new pokemon snap and the only one that has not been featured as a starter in any pokemon game it is possible that this week's pokemon was excluded from the new snowpoint city gym because its evolution is actually weak to ice type attacks who is it it's cathode i get the civilian what no i actually think i remember i want to say it's unpheasant but i don't remember if unfuzzy doesn't appear in the in the park literally the first second of pokemon snap no it is an eevee and a pikachu with a bunnelby standing watching the eevee and the pikachu running around oh you're not talking about park you're talking about like the i said pokemon one of the first three pokemon to appear when you begin playing the new photo you turn it on you're walking up to the lab i thought you were saying the first like level level but when you're part of the picture unpheasant flies over to be fair unpleasant flies is already weak to ice number two i do not have 659 instagram followers yeah you do no i don't i at the time of that writing i had 651 today i have 652 either way 659 is pokedex okay got it got it got it i always forget bundle b is ground that's what it's not gross bumblebee is normal that's what it's diggersb but you said weak to ice it's evolution is weak to ice i don't really listen on this podcast why do i do it here we don't know why you do it i gave you 8 000 different you could literally go on youtube and watch a video of like here's where pokemon snap starts and bunnelby's hanging out right there oh oh either way all right well then you're done you're over it this week's is going to be worse but we didn't get any trivia though hold on okay go for it go for it i don't have any there's nothing uh was it in shuffle it had to have been shuffled yeah yeah everything pre-gen 8 was in shuffle it's so cute but it's got real tiny ears it's very cute is the shiny at all different oh it's got white yeah it's it has white and red eyes which i think is like a different i think it's a reference to a different kind of out the most important piece of trivia written in bulbapedia bundle b seems to be based on a rabbit i have so many rabbits in my backyard i don't know if i should be worried we do we do do this time to time bundle b is designed by a korean designer which is huge for pokemon uh the the lee we'll go with lee for now uh they made ted pig pig knight embar and bundle bees so those are the four pokemon lee had made which is cool they didn't make diggers be though so i'm not sure who the the artist for that is but how weird does that have to be that you work on the evolution and somebody else works on the other yeah like i can't imagine what those meetings are like well james turner said that they when they make a pokemon they don't even get to make the lore of it somebody else does that this is gonna be the weird i would be so weird about i want control this is my precious baby line and don't you mess it up by telling telling people that it eats children or lures them into swamps yeah huh all right are you ready for this week's i'm ready this week is more of a riddle that may prove difficult for our international listeners but even so there may be a home for them whenever my friend chris and i get together we always eat at a particular 24-hour breakfast themed restaurant we enjoy this restaurant so much in fact we have discussed getting matching tattoos featuring the restaurant's iconic font unfortunately this restaurant does not have branches in the dakotas minnesota iowa or wisconsin the closest i could find being down i-35 in kansas city missouri about a six-hour drive away it is not the restaurant referenced in the first sentence of this riddle which does have a branch located about three miles from my home if you wish to obtain the name of this week's fruit based pokemon you will focus on the first word in the name of the restaurant i frequent with chris there are two letters that repeat in that word you will need to substitute them for another letter the first letter of the word though a single letter is technically also a double letter so you will replace it with two letters the first one the first is one of the letters you have already replaced the second is the second to last letter of the word the second and second to last letters are now the same i do not believe the applicable fruit is available on this restaurant's menu i may be wrong this might be your hardest one i blanked out halfway through now it's so easy it's so easy all right well we will be back next week thank you for listening there there was a when i was one earlier in the episode when greg and i were disagreeing on things there was a comment that came of like was it a i think it was an itunes review that said i don't know if these guys like each other yeah people think let it be known that even though greg and i very much disagree uh on a lot of video game stuff i respect the heck out of greg's opinions and i think they're very insightful and very good i had a person dm me on twitter who is like how can you do a show every week when you hate steve so much and i'm like what i don't i i don't hate steve i just think he's wrong in every aspect of his life i still like the dude yeah guys like the dude a lot yeah there's a lot of people who think that we hate each other i i i think that the show the problem is there's been instances where we've all agreed on something yeah and then people yell at us yeah well they're like it's boring again nobody's happy with anything right anymore so i i definitely i definitely am very strongly opinionated on how i feel about games and game development and i talk pokemon a lot and i think i think greg and both will are very insightful in what they say and i'm glad that i'm very glad that they don't agree with me on ninety percent of the things i say otherwise this would be a very boring podcast as i said to many people steve would be a lot smarter if he just agreed with me but but right we obviously we come from very different backgrounds i have studied uh international relations and business i do have a business degree greg is performance and arts and steve doodled or something i went i went to school for design because i wasn't very smart that's what i said doodle did you get a degree did you actually get a phone yes i have a degree an associate's do you get an associate or do you get a bachelor's degree what did you get i know i specialize in graphic design and i have a certification web design ah i did they i got because this came up yesterday with somebody i ended up getting a bachelor of fine arts theater art uh and the reason i didn't get a bachelor's is because for design it is completely useless and i don't want anyone commenting no one in design cares about your degree they care about your portfolio hey guess what i have a career based off of a theater arts degree people so like it's the same thing right international relations if you want to work for the state department you take a equivalent of like an sat exam about u.s history and then have to enter you don't you don't even need a college degree to work in international relations for the united states you just got to have a good portfolio in design a lot of it's who you know let's face it you could be completely unqualified if you're the nephew of the cup of the owner of the company it's fine we'll be back next week uh thank you for listening if you want to follow greg on twitter at white wing will on twitter watching the sync i am at dragging a lake you can
