and her iconic partner steelix are (2:23 - 2:28)
coming to masters well this was (2:26 - 2:29)
published May 21st (2:28 - 2:31)
I believe steeped adjustments in the (2:29 - 2:33)
game now yeah she made her debut in (2:31 - 2:36)
pokemon gold and pokemon silver jasmine (2:33 - 2:38)
was the first gym leader to specialize (2:36 - 2:40)
with steel type Pokemon that many (2:38 - 2:42)
trainers have ever encountered since (2:40 - 2:44)
she's learned some new tricks are sure (2:42 - 2:46)
to come in handy and possio using (2:44 - 2:48)
jasmine and steelix in battles start off (2:46 - 2:51)
by using her ex defense to sharply (2:48 - 2:54)
increase your whole team's defense then (2:51 - 2:58)
unleash sync move steel clad iron tail (2:54 - 3:01)
not only will the sync move mega evolve (2:58 - 3:03)
steelix into mega steelix for the rest (3:01 - 3:05)
of the battle but it will also become (3:03 - 3:08)
more powerful based on how high (3:05 - 3:11)
Jasmine's and steel axes defenses have (3:08 - 3:13)
been raised there's also a flying-type (3:11 - 3:16)
event going on in the game right now (3:13 - 3:19)
pretty short and simple I don't know if (3:16 - 3:22)
Greg you have pulled jasmine probably (3:19 - 3:24)
not because I think you've been pulling (3:22 - 3:26)
for Wally I poke (3:24 - 3:29)
poultra wall-e still have not had wall-e (3:26 - 3:31)
and now I'm like I don't have a lot of (3:29 - 3:34)
gems cuz some of us you know get the old (3:31 - 3:36)
gem filled fashion way we earned them (3:34 - 3:39)
instead of you know signing our soul (3:36 - 3:41)
away to get gems I don't know what you (3:39 - 3:43)
mean (3:41 - 3:46)
Steven how many gems have I have six (3:43 - 3:48)
hundred and twenty so I I've started to (3:46 - 3:52)
pull once on Jasmine and once on wall-e (3:48 - 3:58)
to maximize my dissatisfaction both will (3:52 - 4:00)
be bad it's like shiny hunting you're (3:58 - 4:02)
just yeah consistently disappointed (4:00 - 4:04)
until you finally get it oh I still (4:02 - 4:07)
don't have that to Piper oh look it's (4:04 - 4:09)
Bruno let's see if they get Wally (4:07 - 4:12)
guarantee you I won't how sad would you (4:09 - 4:14)
be if I tried to pull for Wally and I (4:12 - 4:17)
actually got him oh look it's tape but (4:14 - 4:20)
did you get Liza I have I've had the (4:17 - 4:23)
twins for years are you kidding me I (4:20 - 4:26)
have the twins I have the Bryson's I (4:23 - 4:29)
have the Bugsy's I would be happy for (4:26 - 4:33)
you will if you pulled any of these top (4:29 - 4:37)
tier Pokemon master sync pairs could I (4:33 - 4:41)
trade it to you know is there any gotcha (4:37 - 4:44)
game that has trading I don't think so (4:41 - 4:47)
otherwise that I'm like no I feel like (4:44 - 4:49)
there is something that does this is off (4:47 - 4:52)
Pokemon calm this is the big news which (4:49 - 4:55)
I don't know events in date format (4:52 - 4:58)
people wind that up to pointing at (4:55 - 5:01)
specific times of like oh the Pokemon (4:58 - 5:06)
community loves to loves their dates and (5:01 - 5:09)
loves their forecasting right and they (5:06 - 5:13)
have never been wrong Yeah right we got (5:09 - 5:16)
home on the seventh and yeah that's (5:13 - 5:19)
beyond Umbreon and Jen too and then they (5:16 - 5:21)
gave us two more V's in Gen 4 and then (5:19 - 5:22)
they gave us two more and they gave us (5:21 - 5:26)
another even Gen 6 so obviously more V's (5:22 - 5:30)
and gen8 the pattern guys oh wait but (5:26 - 5:31)
anything's gonna happen in the aisle (5:30 - 5:34)
armor new EB form got it because of the (5:31 - 5:36)
fighting Jojo funds we get a fighting (5:34 - 5:37)
well I mean that's why we've had (5:36 - 5:40)
gigantic maxi V all this is to prepare (5:37 - 5:45)
us prepare us for slappy on the slapping (5:40 - 5:48)
Pokemon get gallery' and mr. mime ponies (5:45 - 5:50)
of course we'll add Meowth with hidden (5:48 - 5:54)
abilities for cool Pokemon these are (5:50 - 5:57)
Pokemon comms words not mine for cool (5:54 - 6:01)
Pokemon and bonus items via mystery gift (5:57 - 6:04)
in sword and shield with the release of (6:01 - 6:07)
the aisle of armor the first part of the (6:04 - 6:10)
sword and shield expansion past drawing (6:07 - 6:12)
near so it doesn't look like we're (6:10 - 6:14)
getting a delay on this which I don't (6:12 - 6:17)
necessarily think we would have since (6:14 - 6:19)
Game Freak did technically put out a (6:17 - 6:22)
press release in Japanese a couple of (6:19 - 6:23)
months ago saying that they were working (6:22 - 6:26)
at home and they personally you know (6:23 - 6:27)
didn't think there was gonna be any (6:26 - 6:29)
delays they just you can cut and paste (6:27 - 6:32)
at home I've done it for my job month (6:29 - 6:33)
and a half now it's true yeah I would (6:32 - 6:35)
they're cutting there they're pros they (6:33 - 6:38)
got the Excel spreadsheets open yep (6:35 - 6:40)
players of sword and shield will be able (6:38 - 6:42)
to receive for special glaring pokemon (6:40 - 6:45)
via mystery gift starting May 22nd there (6:42 - 6:46)
will be a new mystery gift every week (6:45 - 6:49)
containing a Pokemon gallery' and mr. (6:46 - 6:51)
mime ghoul Aaron Pony tugged glaring (6:49 - 6:53)
corsola and glaring Meowth along with a (6:51 - 6:55)
variety of items all of these Pokemon (6:53 - 6:58)
will have hidden abilities making them (6:55 - 7:01)
valuable additions to your teams and the (6:58 - 7:03)
mr. mime was in a cherish ball so I (7:01 - 7:06)
think probably safe - safe to gamble (7:03 - 7:09)
maybe the next three will be in cherish (7:06 - 7:11)
ball if you care about the poke ball (7:09 - 7:13)
it's in just just so you know cherish (7:11 - 7:15)
ball does not break down the cherish (7:13 - 7:16)
ball in the master ball are the two that (7:15 - 7:21)
do not breed downward so this is okay (7:16 - 7:24)
this is another kind of silly thing that (7:21 - 7:29)
the English Pokemon website does didn't (7:24 - 7:32)
put like end dates on which is like kind (7:29 - 7:35)
of weird yeah but there are end dates so (7:32 - 7:37)
they they just say like May 22nd glaring (7:35 - 7:40)
mr. mime May 29th Hilarion Ponyta so it (7:37 - 7:42)
doesn't specifically say Glary and mr. (7:40 - 7:45)
mime ends but they do so when I went to (7:42 - 7:47)
the Japanese website they do have actual (7:45 - 7:50)
end dates there it is that when they go (7:47 - 7:53)
mr. mime when a glaring Ponyta starts (7:50 - 7:55)
glaring mr. mime does and it'll keep (7:53 - 7:58)
that in mind I made a handy graphic it's (7:55 - 7:59)
on Twitter and Instagram it'll be in the (7:58 - 8:01)
show notes below if you just want (7:59 - 8:03)
something to refer to and I try to make (8:01 - 8:06)
graphics for news so they're easy to (8:03 - 8:09)
follow they're shareable and I think (8:06 - 8:11)
they've been received well people say (8:09 - 8:14)
they like them so May 22nd glarry and (8:11 - 8:17)
mr. mime hidden ability ice body plus (8:14 - 8:19)
you'll get a lower ball a moon ball a (8:17 - 8:22)
heavy ball in a dream ball so even if (8:19 - 8:23)
you don't want the mr. mime you get some (8:22 - 8:26)
a procore and pokeballs here I never (8:23 - 8:28)
used those I'm feeling in such a big (8:26 - 8:31)
decision upon which one to use or if (8:28 - 8:33)
they ever make I never make that (8:31 - 8:35)
decision and I do everything in luxury (8:33 - 8:40)
balls they have said in the trailer a (8:35 - 8:43)
couple months ago they said that there (8:40 - 8:46)
will be a new they said like I can't (8:43 - 8:48)
remember the exact word that said (8:46 - 8:51)
something of the sort of more APRA corn (8:48 - 8:52)
balls or whatever I don't know people (8:51 - 8:55)
got all up in arms and I'm like oh we're (8:52 - 8:57)
gonna it's we're gonna have apricot (8:55 - 8:59)
trees it's gonna be really easy to do it (8:57 - 9:01)
Kurt will be back I don't know if you (8:59 - 9:05)
guys remember Curtis member Kerr jump to (9:01 - 9:07)
these conclusions right away and maybe (9:05 - 9:10)
that's true maybe maybe like maybe old (9:07 - 9:13)
man Kurt shows up they showed slow poke (9:10 - 9:14)
in the trailer we all know Kurt loves (9:13 - 9:16)
slowpoke maybe he's gonna slam a hammer (9:14 - 9:17)
May Capricorn balls left and right pump (9:16 - 9:18)
a mouth then you don't have to worry (9:17 - 9:20)
about you know these hard decisions of I (9:18 - 9:22)
only have to dream balls do I want to (9:20 - 9:24)
waste this in a dream ball I broke out I (9:22 - 9:25)
just wasted a dream ball God turn off my (9:24 - 9:27)
game I mean 200 IQ is you bring the (9:25 - 9:29)
ampere you ball fetch it back you know (9:27 - 9:31)
no big deal well you're only a needs (9:29 - 9:34)
dream boundary P do know that's baseball (9:31 - 9:37)
no beach ball is for gallery and meow (9:34 - 9:39)
but because he's a beast these events (9:37 - 9:41)
make it seem like they still want these (9:39 - 9:44)
balls to be rare yes and these events (9:41 - 9:47)
and you don't trickling balls out like (9:44 - 9:51)
this there was a weird sentence when you (9:47 - 9:54)
when you trickle poke a balls in in a (9:51 - 9:57)
dlc sort away or in downloadable content (9:54 - 10:00)
sort of way it does it is a way to (9:57 - 10:02)
encourage training which i think they've (10:00 - 10:04)
kind of figured that out of like (10:02 - 10:06)
oh you know I'll use my dream ball on (10:04 - 10:09)
lit wick and now I can give people lit (10:06 - 10:10)
wicks and then they can then they don't (10:09 - 10:12)
have to waste their dream ball I don't (10:10 - 10:14)
look right it's a really good way of (10:12 - 10:16)
encouraging trading but going back of (10:14 - 10:18)
like there probably will be a way to get (10:16 - 10:21)
these APRA corn balls in the island of (10:18 - 10:23)
armor isle of armor maybe you know maybe (10:21 - 10:25)
you have to like you know get to the end (10:23 - 10:27)
of the tower or something but there is a (10:25 - 10:30)
way to do it in sort and shield through (10:27 - 10:32)
the champion cup you can get more of (10:30 - 10:32)
these pokeballs (10:32 - 10:35)
they're extremely extremely rare so I (10:32 - 10:37)
just I get people love these pokeballs (10:35 - 10:39)
and I saw so many people get excited (10:37 - 10:41)
being like oh my gosh we finally have a (10:39 - 10:42)
way to get more of these there was (10:41 - 10:45)
always a way to get more going through (10:42 - 10:47)
the champion Cup was the way so just (10:45 - 10:49)
incredibly unpleasant and what he wants (10:47 - 10:51)
to do it that way so I just you know (10:49 - 10:54)
maybe reassessing about expectations of (10:51 - 10:58)
I who's to say that in the olive armor (10:54 - 11:00)
there's not some other tedious way to (10:58 - 11:04)
get it you have battle points that you (11:00 - 11:06)
have to do I kind of like the rareness (11:04 - 11:10)
of of these pokeballs because I think it (11:06 - 11:12)
does encourage the trading and it makes (11:10 - 11:14)
them feel a little bit special I only (11:12 - 11:17)
use one type of pokeball like for my (11:14 - 11:19)
entire almost my entire glare and (11:17 - 11:22)
pokedex I use one type of pokeball dusk (11:19 - 11:30)
ball you know what I'm only going (11:22 - 11:33)
through these horrible raids to catch (11:30 - 11:36)
pokemon that I need for utility and (11:33 - 11:38)
Dusk's ball's gonna get the job done for (11:36 - 11:40)
me although I did lose an Eevee to a (11:38 - 11:44)
dusk ball this morning mom May 29th (11:40 - 11:47)

my one battle with my good dog in the (14:42 - 14:48)
online competition (14:46 - 14:51)
which have already done the gallery' (14:48 - 14:55)
Emmaus Meowth glared mouth guilt glare (14:51 - 14:59)
Ian mouth event starts June 12th which (14:55 - 15:02)
is a Friday on the calendar far in the (14:59 - 15:07)
future which makes people tend to (15:02 - 15:09)
believe that either the island of armour (15:07 - 15:12)
comes the 19th if we're assuming that (15:09 - 15:15)
the Meowth event last owed so the (15:12 - 15:17)
Japanese website doesn't say when the (15:15 - 15:19)
glaring mouth event ends it says when (15:17 - 15:22)
the you know mime event ends when the (15:19 - 15:24)
pony tail starts ponytail ends when the (15:22 - 15:25)
Cursillo starts corsola ends with the (15:24 - 15:27)
Meowth starts but the Japanese and the (15:25 - 15:28)
English website there's no end date for (15:27 - 15:29)
the Meowth (15:28 - 15:32)
could be a week like the first three if (15:29 - 15:35)
it isn't that means that the island of (15:32 - 15:37)
armor since Nintendo has a history of (15:35 - 15:39)
releasing things on Friday I can't (15:37 - 15:43)
remember and there's probably out of you (15:39 - 15:45)
know all the Switch games well out of (15:43 - 15:47)
the all first party Nintendo games I (15:45 - 15:48)
can't remember one not coming out on (15:47 - 15:51)
Friday that would maybe lean to that the (15:48 - 15:55)
DLC either comes out the 19th when the (15:51 - 15:56)
Meowth event technically would end (15:55 - 15:59)
compared to the other ones or because (15:56 - 16:01)
they said by the end of June the other (15:59 - 16:04)
date is the 26 I don't think he's events (16:01 - 16:08)
suddenly solidify that because there's (16:04 - 16:10)
only four Fridays in the month of June (16:08 - 16:14)
so I don't know roll a die it's either (16:10 - 16:16)
the 5th of the 12th the 19th of the 26 (16:14 - 16:20)
so they said by the end of June it could (16:16 - 16:22)
be the fifth it could be the 12th I mean (16:20 - 16:24)
realistically if they're trying to get (16:22 - 16:26)
everything right they haven't set a date (16:24 - 16:29)
yet they probably want to give people a (16:26 - 16:32)
heads up probably won't be the fifth or (16:29 - 16:33)
twelfth because I feel like maybe that's (16:32 - 16:35)
not enough time we'll probably see one (16:33 - 16:37)
more trailer to really sell the game and (16:35 - 16:42)
show a new feature so 19th and 26th seem (16:37 - 16:45)
extremely plausible as dates I agree (16:42 - 16:49)
it's the 19th no contention here I think (16:45 - 16:50)
if they're showing a trailer they (16:49 - 16:52)
probably have to show new gallery' and (16:50 - 16:55)
pokemon and probably new Giganta max (16:52 - 16:56)
pokemon I think that would really (16:55 - 17:00)
solidify people's purchases not only do (16:56 - 17:02)
you want a trailer to give people a (17:00 - 17:05)
reason to spend the $30 whether that's (17:02 - 17:07)
you know a goal Arian Flygon a gigantic (17:05 - 17:14)
flag on a the to ghal Aryan smoking (17:07 - 17:18)
forms alright yeah well I will slow Punk (17:14 - 17:20)
is really popular I like a gal Aryan (17:18 - 17:23)
side duck likes you you pick a pokemon (17:20 - 17:26)
that people love and identify with and (17:23 - 17:29)
you know 84 or they have all the all the (17:26 - 17:32)
the new legendaries and mythical that (17:29 - 17:36)
you get well yeah they do have cup foo (17:32 - 17:40)
and her Shifu but the the Moltres and (17:36 - 17:42)
Zapdos stuff that's not till the second (17:40 - 17:45)
one the second expansion no I meant (17:42 - 17:46)
[Music] (17:45 - 17:51)
galaxy brain rabbit Oh Cal Cal a Rex Cal (17:46 - 17:53)
Eric yeah oh he's not until the second (17:51 - 17:55)
expand to the second one either (17:53 - 17:57)
yeah we're getting we're gaining a Shifu (17:55 - 17:59)
and cup foo this this time around (17:57 - 18:00)
besides (17:59 - 18:03)
Venusaur and Blastoise getting Giganta (18:00 - 18:05)
max forms and the starters getting (18:03 - 18:07)
Giganta max for them there has to be (18:05 - 18:09)
some other pokemon getting checking it (18:07 - 18:11)
to max form to get people excited maybe (18:09 - 18:14)
the Blastoise and the Venus or is enough (18:11 - 18:15)
but not only do you want to show a (18:14 - 18:17)
trailer to get people who already own (18:15 - 18:19)
the game to purchase the $30 do you want (18:17 - 18:20)
to show a trailer that is good enough (18:19 - 18:23)
where somebody who hasn't considered (18:20 - 18:26)
buying sword and shield to then go well (18:23 - 18:28)
I want to get this I'm sure whenever (18:26 - 18:30)
that trailer drops it'll probably be a (18:28 - 18:33)
day I sleep in because like it seems to (18:30 - 18:36)
happen it's like sleeping today oh gosh (18:33 - 18:38)
I just missed the Pokemon news well how (18:36 - 18:40)
do you sleep in on Tuesday and just make (18:38 - 18:43)
it easy on all of us yeah wait what does (18:40 - 18:47)
sleep in mean for you sleep in is like (18:43 - 18:51)
1:00 p.m. that's pretty decent into the (18:47 - 18:54)
day yeah yeah but I assume they show a (18:51 - 18:56)
trailer in that the trend of the trailer (18:54 - 18:58)
it says a date whether that's June 19 (18:56 - 19:01)
June 26 June 12 whatever hundred (18:58 - 19:03)
experience candies and 50 (19:01 - 19:05)
big nuggets that's a lot of money for (19:03 - 19:08)
that June 12th with the meows so I (19:05 - 19:10)
wonder if clothes are gonna be real real (19:08 - 19:15)
expensive in this expansion yep I have (19:10 - 19:17)
the one outfit I need I don't need any (19:15 - 19:18)
more clothes (19:17 - 19:21)
I need wishing pieces that's it (19:18 - 19:25)
so Pokemon home got updated and we're (19:21 - 19:26)
gonna talk about that in a bit (19:25 - 19:29)
but because Pokemon home got updated (19:26 - 19:34)
that meant that data miners have seen (19:29 - 19:37)
that some new moves have existed in (19:34 - 19:41)
Pokemon home which probably lead to what (19:37 - 19:43)
is possibly coming in Pokemon sword and (19:41 - 19:48)
shield DLC so now this is this is a (19:43 - 19:50)
rumor I think it's slightly interesting (19:48 - 19:52)
there just moves we don't know what the (19:50 - 19:55)
moves do we don't know we don't know who (19:52 - 19:58)
knows the moves we just know the names (19:55 - 19:59)
of the moves (19:58 - 20:01)
there's 21 moves that were pulled from (19:59 - 20:04)
the Pokemon home update here I'm gonna (20:01 - 20:06)
read this off my Nintendo news but this (20:04 - 20:09)
was pulled from sentro Pokemon which is (20:06 - 20:13)
a Spanish Pokemon website that has their (20:09 - 20:15)
the website that they'll pull the assets (20:13 - 20:17)
from Pokemon games so if you've ever (20:15 - 20:18)
watched like a twitch streamer and they (20:17 - 20:20)
have like a little animated Pokemon (20:18 - 20:22)
dancing around that that was probably (20:20 - 20:24)
pulled directly from you know Sun and (20:22 - 20:28)
moons files that animated Pokemon so (20:24 - 20:29)
they pull that stuff they provide those (20:28 - 20:33)
assets ahead and don't know if the (20:29 - 20:34)
Pokemon company knows about them or (20:33 - 20:38)
cares or wants to shut them down but so (20:34 - 20:41)
they have French Italian and Spanish on (20:38 - 20:44)
their website I can't read any of that - (20:41 - 20:46)
end of news apparently did the (20:44 - 20:48)
translation here so these are probably (20:46 - 20:49)
not final names for moves either but we (20:48 - 20:52)
never know so these are some of the (20:49 - 20:54)
moves here expanding force steel roller (20:52 - 20:58)
scale shot meteor beam shell sidearm (20:54 - 21:03)
misty explosion grassy Glide rising (20:58 - 21:06)
voltage see those last three have like a (21:03 - 21:08)
theme to them (21:06 - 21:12)
a terrain plus skitter smack burning (21:08 - 21:15)
jealousy lash out those to sound like (21:12 - 21:17)
dark type moves poltergeist (21:15 - 21:22)
which I guess is not as a move corrosive (21:17 - 21:26)
gas coaching which maybe sounds like a (21:22 - 21:31)
helping hand flip turn triple axel those (21:26 - 21:32)
are two they're adding skateboarding (21:31 - 21:35)
type to the game dual wing beat (21:32 - 21:38)
scorching sands jungle healing which we (21:35 - 21:41)
know is Axl is an ice skating move oh my (21:38 - 21:43)
bad you're yeah Mike flip into an ollie (21:41 - 21:46)
well the first one is called flip turn (21:43 - 21:49)
no jungle healing which we know is a (21:46 - 21:51)
move is a Ruth's signature move (21:49 - 21:56)
wicked blow and surging strikes so those (21:51 - 21:59)
are the 21 moves that seemed to be added (21:56 - 22:02)
to the game or maybe added to the game I (21:59 - 22:03)
can this is that's the none of this is (22:02 - 22:05)
confirmed this is just what people have (22:03 - 22:08)
seen in the update to Pokemon homes (22:05 - 22:11)
database now I'm gonna read them all in (22:08 - 22:14)
Italian see I mean that and they're (22:11 - 22:16)
certain they're just moves they're not (22:14 - 22:19)
yes we're certain their moves yeah there (22:16 - 22:22)
is a there is a move category database (22:19 - 22:25)
in Pokemon home jungle healing we know (22:22 - 22:27)
for sure is a move because they already (22:25 - 22:30)
announced that with Giroud the data (22:27 - 22:32)
miners are believing that both wicked (22:30 - 22:34)
blow and surging strikes are signature (22:32 - 22:36)
moves for her Shifu that sounds right (22:34 - 22:39)
for they're generating poltergeist is (22:36 - 22:44)
prop probably a move for Polti guy that (22:39 - 22:46)
doesn't sound appropriate i corrosive (22:44 - 22:49)
gas sounds like something would be for (22:46 - 22:54)
gallery' and wheezing I know I would (22:49 - 22:59)
think whose rock and roll dude dagnabbit (22:54 - 23:03)
ah that's tricity yeah cuz he's more (22:59 - 23:05)
poisoning I would say rising voltage (23:03 - 23:09)
sounds like a move for toxicity toxicity (23:05 - 23:12)
doesn't fly rising voltage I don't know (23:09 - 23:14)
I feel like that means like increasing (23:12 - 23:17)
the that feels like electric terrain (23:14 - 23:18)
almost but obviously electric terrain is (23:17 - 23:22)
electric train rising voltage misty (23:18 - 23:24)
explosion grassy glide rising voltage (23:22 - 23:28)
terrain plus all seem like but do we (23:24 - 23:31)
think that new like are we making the (23:28 - 23:33)
assumption that new moves are going on (23:31 - 23:37)
existing already in the game Pokemon and (23:33 - 23:40)
not just exclusive for the ones that are (23:37 - 23:44)
being introduced in this expansion so (23:40 - 23:46)
all the ones are being added we'll get (23:44 - 23:49)
these new moves but the ones that (23:46 - 23:52)
already have set move pools are gonna be (23:49 - 23:55)
in touch like what's like making us (23:52 - 23:57)
think that thee that they're gonna start (23:55 - 23:59)
changing if the move sets of ones that (23:57 - 24:01)
are already been in the game to give you (23:59 - 24:02)
a reason to go through the dojo multiple (24:01 - 24:05)
times do you think these are gonna be I (24:02 - 24:08)
bet these are dojo exclusive moves where (24:05 - 24:09)
you have to take your bike you guys (24:08 - 24:13)
through the dojo and learn what the dude (24:09 - 24:17)
is teaching you can move move yeah yeah (24:13 - 24:19)
yeah okay that makes sense (24:17 - 24:21)
because if this whole thing is based (24:19 - 24:23)
around this dojo and if you do the dojo (24:21 - 24:24)
once and you're done people are gonna be (24:23 - 24:27)
like well well that was a waste of $30 (24:24 - 24:29)
but you need to have a reason for (24:27 - 24:31)
somebody to go through the dojo multiple (24:29 - 24:33)
times with different Pokemon and if (24:31 - 24:35)
you're like well you love your toxicity (24:33 - 24:37)
or toxicity is really sweet but now if (24:35 - 24:39)
you take your toxicity through the dojo (24:37 - 24:41)
you walk out with toxicity learning (24:39 - 24:44)
rising voltage that's what I think (24:41 - 24:46)
otherwise I don't I don't know why you (24:44 - 24:47)
would go through the dojo multiple times (24:46 - 24:50)
I mean like what do you even do for the (24:47 - 24:52)
bat like the battle tower why do you go (24:50 - 24:53)
that through that multiple times to get (24:52 - 24:57)
battle to get BP and I appre cornballs (24:53 - 25:00)
no no that's champion cup champion Cup (24:57 - 25:02)
is for a pro cornballs and for wishing (25:00 - 25:04)
pieces and whatever the battle tower is (25:02 - 25:07)
for BP which you can buy ability (25:04 - 25:09)
capsules and stuff it also gives you the (25:07 - 25:11)
ribbon for those who care about that but (25:09 - 25:13)
otherwise this (25:11 - 25:15)
another battling thing and we know there (25:13 - 25:16)
are two towers and we know that (25:15 - 25:18)
depending on what tower you go locks and (25:16 - 25:21)
your cub foo and if they built these two (25:18 - 25:24)
towers or gameplay I can't imagine they (25:21 - 25:25)
want you to go through them once I can't (25:24 - 25:28)
think of a single tower in Pokemon and a (25:25 - 25:29)
Pokemon game where they don't want you (25:28 - 25:30)
to go through multiple times (25:29 - 25:35)
maybe Bellsprout but usually they want (25:30 - 25:38)
you to go through these things you know (25:35 - 25:41)
multiple times yeah I guess you'd like (25:38 - 25:43)
if the if these moves are worth the (25:41 - 25:47)
tutoring venture just a rumor though I (25:43 - 25:49)
mean again these moves were in the (25:47 - 25:51)
database of Pokemon home but we have no (25:49 - 25:53)
clue if they will actually be in a final (25:51 - 25:55)
Pokemon product so I want to stress that (25:53 - 25:59)
it's just a rumor mm-hmm all right from (25:55 - 26:00)
hackers (25:59 - 26:03)
do you trust hackers you trust do you (26:00 - 26:07)
hackers stolen your identity by just (26:03 - 26:10)
believing them speaking of hacking we're (26:07 - 26:13)
gonna hack into a break and then when we (26:10 - 26:14)
come back we'll actually talk about the (26:13 - 26:17)
changes to Pokemon home and then we have (26:14 - 26:20)
a little bit other news and then we'll (26:17 - 26:22)
wrap up the show so we will be right (26:20 - 26:24)

talk about that there is a separate (28:08 - 28:12)
notice in the mobile device version of (28:09 - 28:14)
Pokemon home to notify you when the (28:12 - 28:17)
limited period is going to end but this (28:14 - 28:20)

so you can so they added uh so they you (28:25 - 28:29)
could trade with friends far away you'll (28:27 - 28:31)
be able to friend trade to trade pokémon (28:29 - 28:33)
with friends who are far away great (28:31 - 28:35)
Pokemon with more people around the (28:33 - 28:38)
world using wonder box the time is (28:35 - 28:40)
needed to complete a trade using one or (28:38 - 28:42)
box time has been shortened (28:40 - 28:44)
and then enjoy more casual trades using (28:42 - 28:46)
trade room the number of times you're (28:44 - 28:49)
allowed to join a free group has been (28:46 - 28:51)

additionally the time periods for a (28:51 - 28:56)
player can join a room to select a (28:53 - 28:58)
pokemon have been shortened which we've (28:56 - 28:59)
complained about that it was a little (28:58 - 29:03)
long yeah real long I said are we gonna (28:59 - 29:04)
test this out live Steve are we gonna (29:03 - 29:08)
trade cuz that makes great audio to (29:04 - 29:10)
answer your one question Greg the the (29:08 - 29:16)
reason why they they don't have this is (29:10 - 29:18)
to prevent people from selling Pokemon (29:16 - 29:20)
I'm waiting I'm waiting for a trade (29:18 - 29:23)
right on Greg oh my word (29:20 - 29:26)
I started it oh hey look I think yeah (29:23 - 29:28)
well I mean I think a lot of people were (29:26 - 29:29)
frustrated because you know if you're (29:28 - 29:32)
missing if you're missing I don't know (29:29 - 29:34)
if you're just missing Zehra aura to (29:32 - 29:36)
complete your pokedex and you have a (29:34 - 29:39)
bunch of friends that have zero aura and (29:36 - 29:41)
you don't live near those friends it can (29:39 - 29:44)
be extremely frustrating why do we have (29:41 - 29:48)
to move zero aura from Pokemon home to (29:44 - 29:52)
sword and shield just to trade (29:48 - 29:52)
get that so I don't know why I mean you (29:53 - 29:59)
could yeah I mean will you make a great (29:57 - 30:00)
point of like to prevent people from (29:59 - 30:02)
selling but the people who are buying (30:00 - 30:04)
and the people are selling are going to (30:02 - 30:06)
those both those communities are gonna (30:04 - 30:09)
exist regardless of huh home existing or (30:06 - 30:11)
not exactly yeah but that doesn't mean I (30:09 - 30:14)
have to make it easier for them but we (30:11 - 30:14)
did it (30:14 - 30:18)
trade complete what you trade I got him (30:14 - 30:22)
erectus I got a I got a Roselia oh that (30:18 - 30:23)
sounds about right for both of you guys (30:22 - 30:26)
yeah if I if I'm in Pokemon home and I (30:23 - 30:28)
trade a shell met for a Kara blast am I (30:26 - 30:30)
getting what I expect on the other end (30:28 - 30:32)
or am I just getting a Sheldon in a Kara (30:30 - 30:36)
blast right now I don't have extras I (30:32 - 30:40)
got here I'll trade with Greg I got I'll (30:36 - 30:42)
do I'll do they have it it's good I got (30:40 - 30:44)
I got all of them you let me know what (30:42 - 30:47)
you need on mr. Pokemon I got all the (30:44 - 30:49)
Pokemon so they did limit this is what I (30:47 - 30:53)
this is what I have so many thoughts (30:49 - 30:55)
about this either way (30:53 - 30:58)
organize them they only allow you to (30:55 - 31:02)
trade ten times a day with friends so if (30:58 - 31:05)
if their goal is to prevent people from (31:02 - 31:08)
just trading all day and filling a (31:05 - 31:09)
pokedex (31:08 - 31:13)
maybe that's why but you can do that in (31:09 - 31:15)
Soren shield right I could sit there and (31:13 - 31:18)
trade you all day we'll until you have a (31:15 - 31:20)
complete pokedex in Soren shield I have (31:18 - 31:24)
one Kara blast so I will trade a new a (31:20 - 31:27)
shell with them alright but they limit (31:24 - 31:30)
it ten times at which you know if I (31:27 - 31:32)
trade this Kara blast of Greg and Greg (31:30 - 31:34)
trades me a shell mitt and then they (31:32 - 31:36)
evolve and then we trade back that's two (31:34 - 31:39)
trades so if I'm trading will zero aura (31:36 - 31:41)
for the decks completion he trades a bit (31:39 - 31:44)
what am I looking for shell met okay (31:41 - 31:46)
since from do you honestly think you (31:44 - 31:56)
have a special from the gala region (31:46 - 31:59)
alright we'll do this one all right it (31:56 - 32:01)
looks kind of like a simplified Pokemon (31:59 - 32:03)
go the interface yeah (32:01 - 32:08)
goodbye shell MIT goodbye Kara blast (32:03 - 32:08)
this is how long the trade is taking I'm (32:13 - 32:19)
not gonna cut this audio to prove that (32:15 - 32:19)
sure and everything I mean it's pretty (32:19 - 32:24)
look will it has to go to NASA and then (32:22 - 32:27)
back that's how trading acts has to go (32:24 - 32:30)
to 18 satellites in the sky take a care (32:27 - 32:35)
of shellman it did not a vow thank you (32:30 - 32:40)
for the science fair we did it so you (32:35 - 32:43)
don't have to so I would assume it would (32:40 - 32:45)
be the same with like Haunter and stuff (32:43 - 32:48)
yeah that's dumb but they did build the (32:45 - 32:53)
poll functionality into the game yeah I (32:48 - 32:54)
got just this lonely little shellman (32:53 - 32:55)
here (32:54 - 32:57)
it's a bashful I wish they would just (32:55 - 32:59)
say why they care about this like they (32:57 - 33:02)
clearly do they clearly launched an app (32:59 - 33:03)
with no trading not because they didn't (33:02 - 33:05)
know how to do it because they purposely (33:03 - 33:07)
didn't want people to trade and then (33:05 - 33:09)
they're added trading and then they said (33:07 - 33:11)
it's temporary and you can trade 10 (33:09 - 33:12)
times a day which i think is fair I (33:11 - 33:14)
think that's fine like hey you want to (33:12 - 33:16)
complete your pokedex and you're gonna (33:14 - 33:18)
rope your friend into trading you 200 (33:16 - 33:21)
Pokemon 10 a day I mean I really think (33:18 - 33:24)
that that's still all around not selling (33:21 - 33:27)
Pokemon because the issue is that you're (33:24 - 33:29)
doing this on mobile so there may be (33:27 - 33:31)
some people that are maintaining their (33:29 - 33:34)
pokedex and mobile and don't have a (33:31 - 33:36)
switch yet and they'd still be (33:34 - 33:39)
interested in buying Pokemon I feel like (33:36 - 33:42)
that's such a very specific and small (33:39 - 33:48)
use case to stop millions of people from (33:42 - 33:51)
trading a huge part of the game well (33:48 - 33:53)
yeah I mean there's nothing and no (33:51 - 33:55)
disagreement I mean there's nothing (33:53 - 34:00)
about limbing in in-home that suddenly (33:55 - 34:04)
stops buying Pokemon and you still have (34:00 - 34:06)
to do friend codes do Japanese people (34:04 - 34:09)
even use eBay I don't know if anybody's (34:06 - 34:11)
told them about me (34:09 - 34:16)
I'll check they it's just I'm frustrated (34:11 - 34:17)
in the communication aspect like what (34:16 - 34:20)
they have a thought process of doing (34:17 - 34:22)
this and they just don't communicate it (34:20 - 34:22)
with us (34:22 - 34:26)
like in sword and shield they locked the (34:22 - 34:27)
starters (34:26 - 34:29)
which you can jump to the conclusion the (34:27 - 34:31)
reason they lock starters is because (34:29 - 34:33)
they didn't want people to turn on and (34:31 - 34:36)
off their game for 40 plus hours or 80 (34:33 - 34:39)
plus hours or 200 put like you're not (34:36 - 34:41)
guaranteed a shiny even if it's one in (34:39 - 34:44)
four thousand I have an answer and so (34:41 - 34:47)
they want people to play the game and (34:44 - 34:48)
shiny hunt later (34:47 - 34:52)
so like logically that makes sense they (34:48 - 34:55)
don't want you to you know get to zekrom (34:52 - 34:58)
in black and white and turn on an offer (34:55 - 35:00)
game over and over because they probably (34:58 - 35:02)
want you to see the end of their video (35:00 - 35:04)
game that they made and then when you (35:02 - 35:06)
done when you're done with that end of (35:04 - 35:08)
the video game then you can do whatever (35:06 - 35:11)
you want I think it's very important or (35:08 - 35:14)
your player base to experience the (35:11 - 35:16)
entire package you made so they don't (35:14 - 35:19)
get halfway through a game and then go (35:16 - 35:22)
well this ruined my fun because I didn't (35:19 - 35:24)
get my shiny or I didn't get this or I (35:22 - 35:26)
didn't get that and now I'm going to go (35:24 - 35:28)
to a different game trading at home I (35:26 - 35:32)
can't think of what the logic is at this (35:28 - 35:34)
point and if it is like something like (35:32 - 35:35)
what we don't want people hacking or we (35:34 - 35:37)
don't want people completing the deck so (35:35 - 35:40)
we're trying to like a even the (35:37 - 35:43)
preventing of mythical x' from GTS that (35:40 - 35:45)
totally makes sense you know they want (35:43 - 35:47)
mythical x' to be these rare or pokemon (35:45 - 35:50)
and you can trade Legendary's you can (35:47 - 35:52)
trade forms you can trade a lola you can (35:50 - 35:54)
trade any Pokemon that isn't mythical (35:52 - 35:57)
through GTS cool even if it's hacked but (35:54 - 35:59)
even if it's act which they haven't (35:57 - 36:01)
figured out how to stop or whatever but (35:59 - 36:03)
like come out and say like the reason we (36:01 - 36:05)
don't want mythical x' to be traded on (36:03 - 36:07)
GTS is because we want them to feel (36:05 - 36:09)
special like just tell us what you want (36:07 - 36:12)
to do what you want us to do with your (36:09 - 36:15)
products like why don't are you limiting (36:12 - 36:18)
ten like give us a reason why or tell us (36:15 - 36:20)
like what your thought processes of this (36:18 - 36:22)
why are you going to remove it in the (36:20 - 36:24)
future we are temporarily giving you the (36:22 - 36:25)
ability to trade with people all over (36:24 - 36:27)
the world we will remove that you will (36:25 - 36:29)
see an update in Pokemon home in the (36:27 - 36:31)
future of one we're removing it but why (36:29 - 36:35)
are you giving it to us now are you (36:31 - 36:37)
taking it away and why are you taking it (36:35 - 36:39)
away like just communicate I don't (36:37 - 36:42)
I don't I don't get it I don't get I (36:39 - 36:46)
don't like normally if a business isn't (36:42 - 36:48)
saying something I can usually figure (36:46 - 36:51)
out the the convoluted reason why a (36:48 - 36:57)
corporation would stop it I cannot begin (36:51 - 37:00)
to fathom on a thing that's about (36:57 - 37:03)
trading when you already have multiple (37:00 - 37:06)
steps when you can literally contact a (37:03 - 37:08)
person who's selling it and throw it up (37:06 - 37:10)
in the GTS and say I'm gonna look for (37:08 - 37:12)
this very specific thing you look for (37:10 - 37:15)
this very specific thing go which I've (37:12 - 37:18)
done when I was getting on my video it (37:15 - 37:21)
was really easy to do that allowing this (37:18 - 37:26)
ease and taking it away doesn't make (37:21 - 37:29)
sense if you don't want the problem (37:26 - 37:32)
whatever bizarre problem you're trying (37:29 - 37:34)
to solve if you don't want that problem (37:32 - 37:36)
figure out your code how you're gonna (37:34 - 37:37)
fix it (37:36 - 37:40)
this is it I can't I can't I can't (37:37 - 37:43)
understand also there's no eBay in Japan (37:40 - 37:44)
yeah I saw that (37:43 - 37:46)
so they clearly don't want us a software (37:44 - 37:47)
set for things (37:46 - 37:50)
Zappos ntozake and aterna tests of a lie (37:47 - 37:53)
sorry type know anything that is given (37:50 - 37:55)
to you by a person in that game you (37:53 - 37:57)
can't software set for slowpoke so (37:55 - 37:59)
they're like we're done we don't want (37:57 - 38:02)
people to suffer set okay sure fine but (37:59 - 38:06)
but they also haven't fixed the the (38:02 - 38:08)
break bend bug where people are just (38:06 - 38:10)
moving their clock forward like four (38:08 - 38:11)
days Oh (38:10 - 38:15)
time travelers are the word like within (38:11 - 38:19)
this is such a small market sample but (38:15 - 38:23)
within twitch the second they launched (38:19 - 38:25)
Eevee Giganta max Eevee which by the (38:23 - 38:27)
time this podcast goes up it would (38:25 - 38:30)
probably be rotated - Meowth (38:27 - 38:32)
but within five minutes of Eevee being (38:30 - 38:35)
live at 7:05 p.m. Central Time (38:32 - 38:39)
I went to twitch which is Pokemon sword (38:35 - 38:41)
and shield directory and I counted over (38:39 - 38:46)
50 people hosting SHINee Giganta max (38:41 - 38:49)
Eevee on their streams desperate for (38:46 - 38:51)
anyone to watch them and give them their (38:49 - 38:52)
treasure (38:51 - 38:57)
Wow see once again selling stuff like (38:52 - 39:00)
within five minutes then they have this (38:57 - 39:03)
figured out and if they care about (39:00 - 39:06)
softer setting which they seem to care (39:03 - 39:09)
about now which is fine whatever I get (39:06 - 39:09)
it (39:09 - 39:11)
I also I've said this million times in (39:09 - 39:13)
this podcast I think turning on and off (39:11 - 39:16)
a video game is a bad way to consume a (39:13 - 39:20)
video game if they care about that then (39:16 - 39:22)
why have they did that is island of (39:20 - 39:24)
armor going to fix this right down (39:22 - 39:25)
exploit we know that there's going to be (39:24 - 39:28)
more raids they they care about this but (39:25 - 39:29)
they don't care about that and if they (39:28 - 39:32)
do care about that they haven't fixed it (39:29 - 39:34)
but they have fixed like the wonder (39:32 - 39:36)
trade bug which was like malicious that (39:34 - 39:37)
was I guess more malicious than like a (39:36 - 39:40)
raid em exploit and and they're doing (39:37 - 39:42)
more and more events and they seem to (39:40 - 39:44)
care about that kind of stuff and they (39:42 - 39:45)
don't want people to trade in home (39:44 - 39:46)
unless they're standing next to people (39:45 - 39:48)
but then they just allowed people to (39:46 - 39:50)
trade in home over the Internet (39:48 - 39:51)
but they're going to take it away from (39:50 - 39:54)
everyone is there like two people at (39:51 - 39:56)
Game Freak that leads some sort of (39:54 - 40:00)
divisions that like what is like let (39:56 - 40:02)
them have fun and the other was like no (40:00 - 40:06)
we need to ensure the rarity of these (40:02 - 40:10)
creatures it's no it's it's it's not (40:06 - 40:12)
even that it's it's a it's it's probably (40:10 - 40:14)
like what do we say Game Freak has 180 (40:12 - 40:15)
employees or something like that yeah (40:14 - 40:17)
yeah so it's a hundred and seventy nine (40:15 - 40:19)
of them who are like let's just let (40:17 - 40:21)
people have fun and do fun things and (40:19 - 40:23)
we'll be creative and have creative ways (40:21 - 40:25)
to people have fun and then there's the (40:23 - 40:30)
lawyer and the lawyer says well if we do (40:25 - 40:32)
this we assume a liability and we're (40:30 - 40:34)
going to get sued because somebody's out (40:32 - 40:37)
there selling hacked Pokemon and we knew (40:34 - 40:38)
that it was too easy for people to make (40:37 - 40:40)
hacked Pokemon and now they've created a (40:38 - 40:42)
marketplace for these on your mobile (40:40 - 40:45)
device and some parent got mad so now we (40:42 - 40:47)
have a lawsuit and we really didn't need (40:45 - 40:49)
that aggravation there's a difference (40:47 - 40:53)
though of like somebody actually hacking (40:49 - 40:55)
the game and selling master balls on (40:53 - 40:57)
three masses by the way if you're (40:55 - 40:59)
curious what the price of three master (40:57 - 41:02)
balls are it's $10 on eBay so (40:59 - 41:05)
that's a lot not paying ten real dollars (41:02 - 41:08)
for that well it's not polka bucks I (41:05 - 41:10)
don't know if you can duplicate items (41:08 - 41:12)
in-game I don't think so I don't think (41:10 - 41:14)
there's like a duplication exploit like (41:12 - 41:15)
Animal Crossing seems to have every (41:14 - 41:17)
single week where somebody else has (41:15 - 41:20)
figured out a way to like like Bob the (41:17 - 41:22)
table twist the table shake the table (41:20 - 41:24)
and all of a sudden you got two items (41:22 - 41:26)
pop it but there's like I feel like (41:24 - 41:28)
there's a difference of people (41:26 - 41:33)
exploiting an obvious issue which is the (41:28 - 41:35)
right den because they're not using (41:33 - 41:36)
software to do that and then there's a (41:35 - 41:39)
difference of somebody just X but like (41:36 - 41:43)
I've sold eBay get Giganta max shiny (41:39 - 41:48)
square Charizard $5.99 500 sold not (41:43 - 41:55)
legit it all caps legit shiny like that (41:48 - 41:57)
was probably made with pkx and then (41:55 - 41:59)
duplicated a million times then dudes (41:57 - 42:02)
making $5 in Charizard and and there's a (41:59 - 42:04)
market who's buying it and I feel like (42:02 - 42:06)
I'm more mad at the the people buying (42:04 - 42:09)
the Charizard than I am at the hacker (42:06 - 42:11)
this is people are like well I just want (42:09 - 42:14)
the shiny Charizard to brag about so (42:11 - 42:16)
here's the six bucks on eBay on eBay (42:14 - 42:21)
right now I could buy for my Pokemon (42:16 - 42:25)
sword and shield not only is it a 6 IV (42:21 - 42:27)
GMAX Charizard (42:25 - 42:32)
but it's ultra shiny ultra shiny oh and (42:27 - 42:39)
it's only $2 677 sold 100% buyer (42:32 - 42:45)
satisfaction free shipping $1,000 $1,000 (42:39 - 42:48)
greg free shipping though it's a heck of (42:45 - 42:51)
a deal and it's timid nature (42:48 - 42:54)
it's got fire blast dragon pulse solar (42:51 - 42:57)
beam and air slash and it's ultra shiny (42:54 - 43:00)
and i use paypal credit (42:57 - 43:03)
this person also is selling an ultra (43:00 - 43:07)
shiny dusty to not ditto and ultra shiny (43:03 - 43:09)
Gengar what if what a game for kids what (43:07 - 43:12)
Indian freak just did an event where it (43:09 - 43:14)
was really easy to get to those and when (43:12 - 43:16)
you caught the ditto it gave you like (43:14 - 43:18)
destiny not to never say I'm sorry I was (43:16 - 43:19)
sick in the hospital when that event (43:18 - 43:22)
happened so so it's a ebay you go (43:19 - 43:27)
exactly 6iv perfect shiny not ultra (43:22 - 43:30)
shiny though kirim sorry I'm gonna wait (43:27 - 43:32)
for an ultra shiny to show up an eBay (43:30 - 43:35)
for two bucks this is the this is the (43:32 - 43:37)
strangest but this is like every game (43:35 - 43:39)
they like even even in like World of (43:37 - 43:41)
Warcraft there were like by my World of (43:39 - 43:43)
Warcraft account I'm level eighty I have (43:41 - 43:45)
none of that has stopped like ever but (43:43 - 43:49)
like there's you we get spam in Final (43:45 - 43:52)
Fantasy 14 to level your character up (43:49 - 43:55)
get whatever job you want up just turn (43:52 - 43:57)
the account over to so-and-so and (43:55 - 43:59)
they'll just quick do all the work like (43:57 - 44:02)
that that market has never stopped just (43:59 - 44:04)
like this market has never stopped and I (44:02 - 44:07)
don't think limiting limiting these (44:04 - 44:09)
steps that they take to limit these (44:07 - 44:13)
things is gonna do anything the problem (44:09 - 44:16)
is isn't that it can happen in game the (44:13 - 44:17)
problem is is that they're not pursuing (44:16 - 44:22)
their IP through things like eBay like (44:17 - 44:25)
this exists this has been a problem (44:22 - 44:29)
forever in the game and you aren't doing (44:25 - 44:31)
anything to stop it that is the bigger (44:29 - 44:35)
law concern then it's easier to trade in (44:31 - 44:37)
home I mean the only thing I can think (44:35 - 44:41)
of is that it might be easier to hack (44:37 - 44:44)
the home database to create (44:41 - 44:47)
quote-unquote legitimate looking on your (44:44 - 44:49)
phone into another conent have never (44:47 - 44:51)
bought their game well if you look at (44:49 - 44:52)
something like Pokemon go Pokemon (44:51 - 44:55)
masters like our there's our people (44:52 - 44:57)
hacking in coins or gems I mean they're (44:55 - 44:59)
okay there were it was like a jetpack in (44:57 - 45:02)
like first week but they fixed it but (44:59 - 45:04)
like I can't go on eBay and like buy (45:02 - 45:08)
gems on Pokemon Matt well mmm hold on (45:04 - 45:11)
and especially because of Android and (45:08 - 45:13)
androids ability to (45:11 - 45:16)
you do all kinds of yes manipulations (45:13 - 45:18)
that there's completely susceptible to (45:16 - 45:21)
these kinds of things okay at least on (45:18 - 45:22)
the first page of eBay there's nothing (45:21 - 45:24)
for Pokemon masters gems there's just a (45:22 - 45:27)
lot of Pokemon TCG cards yeah I don't (45:24 - 45:30)
know that masters has enough people (45:27 - 45:32)
playing it to make the big bucks well (45:30 - 45:34)
there are a lot of cards though I mean (45:32 - 45:35)
at least cards you get something (45:34 - 45:37)
physical well technically it's against (45:35 - 45:39)
eBay's Terms of Service to sell (45:37 - 45:41)
something digital like eBay cannot (45:39 - 45:44)
protect you against digital delivery (45:41 - 45:48)
because they cannot prove it existed (45:44 - 45:51)
so if theoretically why are we always (45:48 - 45:52)
talking about terms of service on the (45:51 - 45:58)
show we literally started terms of (45:52 - 45:59)
service podcast (45:58 - 46:04)
oh I'm in it so deep we're gonna hit a (45:59 - 46:07)
wider market finally I'll finally know (46:04 - 46:12)
all those things I just said agree yes (46:07 - 46:14)
let's do this I need to know how deep I (46:12 - 46:17)
am with China if you're selling a gift (46:14 - 46:19)
card on eBay you're supposed to (46:17 - 46:21)
physically mail them the gift card so (46:19 - 46:23)
I've run into this issue with destiny (46:21 - 46:25)
emblems huh gosh what - talk about a (46:23 - 46:29)
marketplace Wow PAX West would always (46:25 - 46:31)
have an area where you could play (46:29 - 46:34)
destiny and you would wait in line for (46:31 - 46:36)
like three hours because it's pax and (46:34 - 46:38)
then when you get in there you would (46:36 - 46:39)
play a match of crucible which would be (46:38 - 46:41)
like seven minutes and then when you're (46:39 - 46:43)
done you would get an exclusive emblem (46:41 - 46:45)
and it was just a postcard with a (46:43 - 46:47)
picture of the emblem and then it was (46:45 - 46:49)
like a 12-digit code and then you would (46:47 - 46:51)
go into destiny he would go to Bungie (46:49 - 46:54)
dot whatever net and bungie.net you (46:51 - 46:55)
would sign into your playstation or xbox (46:54 - 46:58)
account you would hit redeem code you (46:55 - 47:00)
would punch in the set the 12 digit code (46:58 - 47:02)
and then it would give you an exclusive (47:00 - 47:06)
emblem in destiny on these emblems were (47:02 - 47:09)
the things that cost money if it was (47:06 - 47:12)
worth it to you and you didn't care (47:09 - 47:14)
about destiny or you could sucker your (47:12 - 47:17)
friends into waiting in line with you (47:14 - 47:19)
you would wait in line to play destiny (47:17 - 47:22)
at PAX you would get the emblem for (47:19 - 47:24)
yourself you would have your friends (47:22 - 47:25)
that didn't care about destiny give you (47:24 - 47:26)
the emblems and these (47:25 - 47:29)
emblems at the time they went from (47:26 - 47:32)
anywhere between 50 to 250 dollars (47:29 - 47:36)
because destiny players wanted to (47:32 - 47:37)
collect these emblems I was a part of (47:36 - 47:40)
this I'm I was a monster I apologize I (47:37 - 47:43)
realized my odd I realized but because I (47:40 - 47:47)
cared about collecting everything in (47:43 - 47:49)
destiny like I ironically I care about (47:47 - 47:52)
collecting things in Pokemon I did not (47:49 - 47:55)
feel like I did not feel like I was (47:52 - 47:59)
getting scammed in a way of if I go to (47:55 - 48:02)
ebay and I see perfect 6iv (47:59 - 48:07)
all caps legit Charizard $1.99 600 sold (48:02 - 48:08)
right because I knew where the codes (48:07 - 48:11)
were coming from and I'm paying for a (48:08 - 48:13)
code that somebody waited in line for (48:11 - 48:17)
and I would prefer them to mail it to me (48:13 - 48:19)
but because they don't want to deal with (48:17 - 48:21)
the mail they would send me the code (48:19 - 48:23)
through eBay for like you know I bought (48:21 - 48:25)
it for like 50 bucks I would redeem it (48:23 - 48:28)
at my game but if it didn't work (48:25 - 48:31)
or if it did work I could go to ebay and (48:28 - 48:34)
say like the seller never got me my item (48:31 - 48:36)
and I would win by default (48:34 - 48:40)
because eBay cannot prove that they (48:36 - 48:45)
emailed me a code and even if well they (48:40 - 48:47)
can't they can't look at the email and (48:45 - 48:49)
say like oh there's a code here but that (48:47 - 48:50)
code could have been expired before you (48:49 - 48:53)
sent it to me so eBay cannot protect (48:50 - 48:59)
against that so I when I sold codes I (48:53 - 49:01)
mailed him by night miss I mailed um me (48:59 - 49:03)
I physically mailed them and I paid the (49:01 - 49:06)
extra two bucks for the tracking number (49:03 - 49:10)
but I guess again doesn't can can't (49:06 - 49:13)
prove that that code wasn't already (49:10 - 49:15)
redeemed before I sent it which is like (49:13 - 49:19)
really weird but I eBay is ze BAE's eBay (49:15 - 49:23)
I just sent two of the wildest things (49:19 - 49:25)
her friend a crust (49:23 - 49:30)
in my ebay hunt stacked Pokemon masters (49:25 - 49:34)
21 five-star olivia Brendon blue-red I (49:30 - 49:37)
owe s 550 dollars this is just (49:34 - 49:39)
somebody's account though this druid and (49:37 - 49:42)
fifty dollars to buy somebody's account (49:39 - 49:44)
I mean how much would you pay for a (49:42 - 49:46)
level forty Pokemon go account (49:44 - 49:48)
none cuz those sell like hotcakes (49:46 - 49:53)
nothing happens at forty what mister (49:48 - 49:55)
used to play World of Warcraft (49:53 - 49:57)
yeah what was like a high-level world (49:55 - 50:00)
Warcraft account going for like 200 (49:57 - 50:03)
bucks um like back when it was popular (50:00 - 50:07)
yeah I mean back back in its heyday I (50:03 - 50:10)
think I once it was around four hundred (50:07 - 50:12)
five hundred dollars but that's not (50:10 - 50:14)
somebody hacking an account though that (50:12 - 50:15)
is somebody putting in time to play an (50:14 - 50:20)
account to then flip it no you would say (50:15 - 50:21)
that those were hacked accounts yeah (50:20 - 50:27)
okay yes yes they were like this dude it (50:21 - 50:29)
doesn't say that they this doesn't say (50:27 - 50:32)
is stacked Pokemon masters 21 five-star (50:29 - 50:34)
characters it doesn't say they sold like (50:32 - 50:37)
40 of these yet this just seems like a (50:34 - 50:40)
single account right now a World of (50:37 - 50:46)
Warcraft Alliance made pre owned is $45 (50:40 - 50:47)
or best offer (50:46 - 50:51)
oh I mean cuz it's Alliance not horde oh (50:47 - 50:55)
don't even like you could if you really (50:51 - 50:57)
wanted to you could probably search eBay (50:55 - 51:00)
for like like Pokemon Center birthday (50:57 - 51:03)
code because if you in Japan if you go (51:00 - 51:05)
to a Pokemon Center and you like show (51:03 - 51:07)
them your license and they're like oh (51:05 - 51:08)
you were born in July it's July well (51:07 - 51:10)
happy birthday and then they give you a (51:08 - 51:12)
code for the game and then you get like (51:10 - 51:14)
a birthday Chansey or whatever and you (51:12 - 51:16)
can redeem it in like let's go and you (51:14 - 51:17)
could usually find those on eBay for (51:16 - 51:19)
like 10 bucks but I think like that is (51:17 - 51:23)
different than just like the $2 6iv (51:19 - 51:26)
legit shiny Charizard that came with a (51:23 - 51:28)
master ball right because like one is (51:26 - 51:31)
pinging Nintendo servers to download the (51:28 - 51:34)
birthday Chansey yeah and then one just (51:31 - 51:36)
came from like pkx but like at the end (51:34 - 51:38)
of the day they're just like they're not (51:36 - 51:41)
worth anything well I guess the char (51:38 - 51:44)
[Laughter] (51:41 - 51:47)
if we go back to the Pokemon home (51:44 - 51:48)
argument if we get rid of the whole (51:47 - 51:51)
concept of they're doing this because of (51:48 - 51:53)
hacking and because of eBay and because (51:51 - 51:56)
of that what other possible reason could (51:53 - 51:57)
there be where they don't want people to (51:56 - 51:59)
trade like I just don't understand I (51:57 - 52:03)
don't know it doesn't I ate and I don't (51:59 - 52:07)
know yeah can't read their minds I wish (52:03 - 52:09)
they would say I mean I wish there was (52:07 - 52:14)
some level of transparency there well (52:09 - 52:16)
we'll keep you we'll keep you updated (52:14 - 52:20)
stay tuned for dangerous guests coming (52:16 - 52:23)

think so (52:55 - 53:01)
trainers trainers three draconic roars (52:57 - 53:04)
can be heard in the distance one belongs (53:01 - 53:07)
to a Pokemon that is capable of (53:04 - 53:09)
scorching the world when people turned (53:07 - 53:14)
their backs on the truth another belongs (53:09 - 53:17)
to a Pokemon that can raise entire (53:14 - 53:21)
kingdoms with its electricity if ideals (53:17 - 53:24)
are not revered the final roar belongs (53:21 - 53:28)
to a Pokemon which dwells an even (53:24 - 53:32)
greater power beyond bound by extreme (53:28 - 53:36)
cold originally discovered in the (53:32 - 53:39)
universe met by trainers in pokemon (53:36 - 53:41)

manaphy and phione will be forgotten by (55:04 - 55:09)
the Pokemon company international now (55:07 - 55:11)
they'll have something that takes like (55:09 - 55:14)
40 years that you got to walk with this (55:11 - 55:18)
is a 200 thousand kilometer egg and you (55:14 - 55:21)

money because you will put you will put (55:31 - 55:34)
the manaphy in your free incubator and (55:33 - 55:36)

not hatching eggs that you will buy (55:36 - 55:42)
other incubators for the other eggs oh (55:39 - 55:46)

hold on oh yeah he'll Dodd we're (55:51 - 55:58)
supposed to be voting on Twitter correct (55:54 - 56:01)
oh yeah yeah that's this week oast to (55:58 - 56:08)
start today the 23rd to the 24th it is (56:01 - 56:12)
know where their site am i missing it am (56:08 - 56:15)
i missing this place we vote the last (56:12 - 56:17)
thing i thought was from 16 hours ago (56:15 - 56:20)
saying hey look at squirtle I don't know (56:17 - 56:23)
am i voting for wishfully voting for who (56:20 - 56:25)
gets in the next community day I think (56:23 - 56:26)
they'll probably would they not start (56:25 - 56:28)
the voting when community starts so the (56:26 - 56:29)
community hasn't started in New Zealand (56:28 - 56:32)
yet as of this recording but it's only (56:29 - 56:35)
through Twitter right but you only vote (56:32 - 56:36)
through Twitter so why does the (56:35 - 56:39)
community is people accessing their (56:36 - 56:41)
phone doesn't well they're doing the 24 (56:39 - 56:42)
hour thing right (56:41 - 56:45)
yeah so I would assume that the voting (56:42 - 56:48)
would exist through the 24 hour YouTube (56:45 - 56:50)
thing so they reminding people through (56:48 - 56:52)
the YouTube video to like vote and so (56:50 - 56:54)
they're probably gonna start with New (56:52 - 56:56)
Zealand's community starts which is the (56:54 - 56:58)
night it knows what happens (56:56 - 57:01)
New Zealand yeah everyone knows because (56:58 - 57:02)
when it breaks in New Zealand people (57:01 - 57:04)
then have their expectations for when (57:02 - 57:05)
their communities yep that's exactly (57:04 - 57:09)
what happens okay giorgia true all right (57:05 - 57:12)
question of the week it's something (57:09 - 57:14)
unpredictable that comes at the end of (57:12 - 57:19)
podcast now let's have that question (57:14 - 57:24)
asked I almost had it at the beginning (57:19 - 57:27)
and then you lost me at the end ooh lots (57:24 - 57:29)
of questions this week yeah I try to (57:27 - 57:31)
time it so that it doesn't disappear cuz (57:29 - 57:34)
certain things move very fast this is (57:31 - 57:36)
from Katherine wild speculation (57:34 - 57:39)
will we have Pokemon go integration (57:36 - 57:41)
sorry well we have pokemon home (57:39 - 57:44)
integration for go before or after the (57:41 - 57:48)
dlc drops researcher (57:44 - 57:50)
oh absolutely after after that are not (57:48 - 57:54)
ready for that yeah I don't think I I (57:50 - 57:58)
think with as much that Pokemon go is (57:54 - 58:01)
trying to do to do at home stuff and all (57:58 - 58:02)
the other things and all the raid stuff (58:01 - 58:06)
like they are willing to put that off (58:02 - 58:09)
until now that we're so close to the DLC (58:06 - 58:11)
coming like they don't want necessarily (58:09 - 58:16)
overlap those two messaging so I imagine (58:11 - 58:17)
that we'll probably hear about home (58:16 - 58:19)
integration in July (58:17 - 58:20)
I always thought home and ger (58:19 - 58:22)
integration was gonna be like knee (58:20 - 58:25)
antics summer thing yeah that was last (58:22 - 58:27)
year when we thought we'd have a summer (58:25 - 58:29)
yeah we don't have a summer (58:27 - 58:32)
what's that Green Day yeah it was a (58:29 - 58:36)
green dip here oh nice okay cuz like (58:32 - 58:37)
summer is when the antic likes to roll (58:36 - 58:39)
out new things yep yeah because people (58:37 - 58:42)
are outdoors enjoying the outdoors I (58:39 - 58:45)
think summer but I also think that what (58:42 - 58:48)
come on home is not like it's still so (58:45 - 58:50)
hard to recommend Pokemon home like if (58:48 - 58:52)
somebody came into if somebody came up (58:50 - 58:53)
to me and they're like man I love (58:52 - 58:54)
Pokemon I've been hearing about Pokemon (58:53 - 58:57)
home love to store my Pokemon you think (58:54 - 58:58)
it's worth the sixteen dollars a year (58:57 - 59:00)
it's so hard for me to say like yep (58:58 - 59:04)
totally is because it's it's a it's an (59:00 - 59:06)
easier question to answer if you're like (59:04 - 59:07)
well I already used Pokemon bank and my (59:06 - 59:10)
Pokemon bank is full so do you think (59:07 - 59:12)
it's worth it like yeah cuz its more (59:10 - 59:14)
storage yeah if you have like 200 (59:12 - 59:18)
Pokemon is Pokemon home worth it for 16 (59:14 - 59:22)
bucks a year I don't know oh heck now (59:18 - 59:23)
for me it is (59:22 - 59:26)
but for a casual pokemon person is so (59:23 - 59:28)
hard to recommend Pokemon home at this (59:26 - 59:28)
point (59:28 - 59:32)
yeah I mean I think home is really a (59:28 - 59:35)
hard core you really into it and you're (59:32 - 59:36)
really into keeping them and you're (59:35 - 59:40)
really into tracking them and I mean (59:36 - 59:43)
it's like I mean it's only 16 bucks but (59:40 - 59:45)
that that seems like if you aren't gonna (59:43 - 59:50)
use it a lot that is a waste really want (59:45 - 59:52)
that McGee Rinna I still haven't gotten (59:50 - 59:55)
that McGee Reena I saw I did but look (59:52 - 59:59)
there's a lot that I haven't done well (59:55 - 60:02)
Pokemon of the week well okay last (59:59 - 60:05)
week's Pokemon of the week it was either (60:02 - 60:09)
hard or not hard you know either got it (60:05 - 60:11)
or you didn't although I did hear that I (60:09 - 60:13)
threw people off by describing it as a (60:11 - 60:17)
delightful Pokemon because people just (60:13 - 60:19)
take me at face value as opposed to (60:17 - 60:23)
sarcastic lessons-learned folk if I'm (60:19 - 60:25)
gonna do sarcasm if I got the option (60:23 - 60:29)
it was first revealed in the Pokemon (60:25 - 60:33)
cartoon on May 8th 2003 so you think (60:29 - 60:35)
about what series was happening at that (60:33 - 60:39)
point in time and it has its evolution (60:35 - 60:43)
is based on its personality value much (60:39 - 60:46)
like spin to spots and unknowns letter (60:43 - 60:49)
and the calculation is based on the (60:46 - 60:52)
mathematical principle of modulo which (60:49 - 60:54)
if you don't know what modulo is it's (60:52 - 60:56)
where you divide two numbers and then (60:54 - 60:59)
the modulo is the remainder when you use (60:56 - 61:01)
the remainder for your calculation and (60:59 - 61:04)
you had to you have to have a modulo (61:01 - 61:07)
greater than four and then there's all (61:04 - 61:08)
kinds of weird things that can happen (61:07 - 61:10)
with breeding because the final (61:08 - 61:14)
evolution can breed for a completely (61:10 - 61:17)
different Pokemon so who's that Pokemon (61:14 - 61:19)

and silcoon they are all known as the (62:33 - 62:38)
cocoon Pokemon cascoon and silcoon have (62:36 - 62:41)
the same exact type base stat moveset (62:38 - 62:44)
shape making them nearly identical (62:41 - 62:47)
cascoon along with silcoon can be seen (62:44 - 62:51)
without limit protrusion in their body (62:47 - 62:54)
via the anime all main series games from (62:51 - 62:54)
X&Y (62:54 - 62:57)
onward and occasionally in heartgold (62:54 - 62:58)
SoulSilver (62:57 - 63:01)
that means like in older games they were (62:58 - 63:03)
very spiky and in newer games they're (63:01 - 63:05)
not spiky but they can become spiky (63:03 - 63:09)
through their animation hmm yep cascoon (63:05 - 63:11)
is he all real weird yeah it is weird (63:09 - 63:13)
cascoon is the only Pokemon found in (63:11 - 63:16)
friend Safari that's not its own type it (63:13 - 63:18)
is found in the poison-type friend (63:16 - 63:19)
Safari (63:18 - 63:22)
even though cascoon is a pure bug type (63:19 - 63:24)
however it does evolve into the (63:22 - 63:27)
poison-type pokémon dustox (63:24 - 63:29)

psychic flying-type quasi bird had been (65:28 - 65:33)
