what's up everyone welcome to the 544th (0:23 - 0:29)
episode of the Pokemon podcast it's (0:27 - 0:32)
super effective I'm your host Steve with (0:29 - 0:35)
me is Greg hello I'm back (0:32 - 0:38)
back from Philadelphia the wonderful Pax (0:35 - 0:41)
experience where I was getting pins and (0:38 - 0:43)
having my picture taken (0:41 - 0:47)
who's taking your picture I went as (0:43 - 0:49)
Professor turo for approximately four (0:47 - 0:51)
hours because (0:49 - 0:53)
boy are those costumes hard to get in (0:51 - 0:55)
and out of when you have to do certain (0:53 - 0:58)
biological functions and people stopped (0:55 - 0:59)
me including the super cute Japanese (0:58 - 1:02)
couple who didn't speak a lot (0:59 - 1:05)
of English but did manage to get up (1:02 - 1:06)
professor turo (1:05 - 1:08)
pictures (1:06 - 1:10)
and then I have no idea what happened (1:08 - 1:12)
after that I don't know what they were (1:10 - 1:15)
saying about me (1:12 - 1:17)
they're very sweet though I'm assuming I (1:15 - 1:19)
don't know I don't know what they said (1:17 - 1:21)
I'm very into that I didn't know Pax was (1:19 - 1:23)
a International Event at this point (1:21 - 1:24)
apparently (1:23 - 1:27)
jeez Hannah also here (1:24 - 1:31)
I am tired but I am here that's a Sunday (1:27 - 1:33)
in a nutshell (1:31 - 1:36)
yes yes it is (1:33 - 1:39)
uh okay so we have um pretty much like (1:36 - 1:42)
two big things to talk about uh one is (1:39 - 1:45)
Pokemon go they did a new thingy with (1:42 - 1:49)
the butterflies which is oh I think I (1:45 - 1:50)
think everyone likes this I have (1:49 - 1:54)
suspicion about this uh new thing uh and (1:50 - 1:58)
then we have the uh anime anime stuff (1:54 - 2:00)
um and there's a big unite update as (1:58 - 2:02)
well or I guess (2:00 - 2:05)
event coming (2:02 - 2:08)
um so we'll go through that uh and then (2:05 - 2:09)
if we have any other time we'll we'll (2:08 - 2:12)
cover that stuff uh (2:09 - 2:14)
so I guess (2:12 - 2:16)
we can get the smaller stuff out of the (2:14 - 2:17)
way I completely forgot to put this in (2:16 - 2:19)
the show notes but what is the point of (2:17 - 2:21)
having these things I know start off (2:19 - 2:22)
with news Well there wasn't really an (2:21 - 2:25)
article about it it was just that uh Mr (2:22 - 2:28)
Joe serebi confirmed (2:25 - 2:29)
um I'm not sure where he probably got (2:28 - 2:31)
from the Japanese Twitter there's like (2:29 - 2:33)
18 official Japanese Pokemon twitters (2:31 - 2:36)
and they all they all tweet in Japanese (2:33 - 2:38)
so sometimes you miss something but I (2:36 - 2:39)
believe they did confirm that they were (2:38 - 2:41)
working on a fix (2:39 - 2:45)
for the bug that happens in raids with (2:41 - 2:51)
the HP bar oh yes I am so excited (2:45 - 2:55)
this this Charizard weekend has been a (2:51 - 2:58)
roller coaster of emotions because of (2:55 - 3:02)
that very bug it's like we did it (2:58 - 3:05)
oh no we didn't it's green a surprise (3:02 - 3:08)
how what (3:05 - 3:08)
I hadn't actually run into it because I (3:08 - 3:12)
didn't do the Charizard raids last (3:10 - 3:14)
weekend I only started doing them this (3:12 - 3:17)
weekend and I at first thought that (3:14 - 3:18)
maybe I could try soloing it because (3:17 - 3:20)
Steve said that soloing the Charizard (3:18 - 3:22)
was easier that did not work then I (3:20 - 3:26)
tried doing it with uh random people (3:22 - 3:29)
online I think and ran into the HP bar (3:26 - 3:31)
issue in a really bad way and that (3:29 - 3:33)
definitely did not work and then I (3:31 - 3:35)
finally got it done on stream here's the (3:33 - 3:39)
thing it if you have three zoomerals who (3:35 - 3:40)
all belly drum and then I'll hit Play (3:39 - 3:43)
Rough Boy does the terror rate system go (3:40 - 3:45)
I hate you and I'm not gonna work (3:43 - 3:48)
anymore we're done yeah we're just I (3:45 - 3:49)
think we're done we talked about this (3:48 - 3:53)
last week yes we did (3:49 - 3:56)
but every time I had more than one (3:53 - 3:59)
zoomeral I was like well I gotta be here (3:56 - 4:01)
for four hours and I don't know if I'm (3:59 - 4:03)
gonna actually progress anywhere in this (4:01 - 4:04)
raid (4:03 - 4:07)
let me tell you you know the the the bug (4:04 - 4:10)
rarely if never happened if it was like (4:07 - 4:12)
two sylveons and two Grim snarls it just (4:10 - 4:14)
though those are always went the (4:12 - 4:17)
smoothest in my opinion (4:14 - 4:17)
um (4:17 - 4:20)
just because of the fake tears Moon (4:17 - 4:23)
blast slash hyper voice whatever I just (4:20 - 4:25)
brought my dog yeah (4:23 - 4:28)
the dog beat up a big lizard all weekend (4:25 - 4:30)
I I was I was still a fan of three dogs (4:28 - 4:32)
one grip snarl because you get all the (4:30 - 4:35)
dogs to howl that that was that was (4:32 - 4:37)
always a good Strat (4:35 - 4:39)
um yeah I mean like that was that was (4:37 - 4:42)
the second time for Charizard (4:39 - 4:44)
as we're recording this I think (4:42 - 4:45)
Charizard has like four hours left (4:44 - 4:49)
before he's he's gone again uh I still (4:45 - 4:51)
you know issues aside with (4:49 - 4:53)
you know sometimes getting stuck in your (4:51 - 4:57)
menu or sometimes the HP bar (4:53 - 5:02)
uh I still really enjoy (4:57 - 5:05)
the raids system I mean like I I prefer (5:02 - 5:07)
I do like the real time I do like that (5:05 - 5:09)
there needs to be some sort of strategy (5:07 - 5:12)
involved uh I do like that there's a you (5:09 - 5:14)
know you ideally you need communication (5:12 - 5:15)
but like if somebody's bringing a (5:14 - 5:17)
specific Pokemon and they know both like (5:15 - 5:20)
I should maybe watch HP bars and maybe I (5:17 - 5:22)
should cheer and maybe I should you know (5:20 - 5:25)
howl or you know fake Moon whatever you (5:22 - 5:26)
need to do (5:25 - 5:28)
I feel like once that system's in place (5:26 - 5:32)
uh they do go pretty okay (5:28 - 5:35)
um I mean it's it it's com the thing is (5:32 - 5:36)
it's not like sword and shield where you (5:35 - 5:38)
just bring zashian and you just hit (5:36 - 5:40)
Behemoth blade for three turns and then (5:38 - 5:42)
you're done right like there is no I (5:40 - 5:44)
think the the main takeaway is in like (5:42 - 5:46)
sword and shield you went in and you hit (5:44 - 5:49)
these super effective move and then you (5:46 - 5:51)
hit nothing else you just hit one move (5:49 - 5:53)
three to four times and then you were (5:51 - 5:53)
done (5:53 - 5:56)
and you could like I said last week or (5:53 - 5:58)
the week before you could go in and you (5:56 - 6:00)
could hit Crunch and crunch and crunch (5:58 - 6:03)
and crunch but that's probably one of (6:00 - 6:06)
the worst strategies you can you can do (6:03 - 6:09)
your Pokemon has so many other options (6:06 - 6:11)
right like if you're going this way I (6:09 - 6:12)
said last week if you're going to go in (6:11 - 6:15)
and just you know crunch maybe crunch is (6:12 - 6:16)
a bad example let's say You're Gonna (6:15 - 6:17)
Play Rough on a mimikyu (6:16 - 6:19)
you should probably store Sans first (6:17 - 6:20)
because if you're gonna hit that play (6:19 - 6:22)
rough button multiple times you might as (6:20 - 6:24)
well get double the damage every single (6:22 - 6:25)
turn (6:24 - 6:28)
or you might as well cheer so you'll get (6:25 - 6:31)
50 increase of damage but also your (6:28 - 6:34)
teammates get a 50 increase of damage (6:31 - 6:35)
um like there's so many things you can (6:34 - 6:36)
do (6:35 - 6:38)
to (6:36 - 6:42)
accelerate the damage you can do instead (6:38 - 6:45)
of just the sergeant Shield system of (6:42 - 6:48)
just well I'm to be fair sword and (6:45 - 6:50)
shield had it where you didn't have a (6:48 - 6:52)
lot of strategy right like yeah she (6:50 - 6:54)
their Shields went up and you were just (6:52 - 6:55)
like well I guess we just gotta break (6:54 - 6:57)
this (6:55 - 6:58)
um (6:57 - 6:59)
and I think that's why people like to (6:58 - 7:01)
the metoo ones so much because there was (6:59 - 7:03)
a bit of I mean like once people figured (7:01 - 7:05)
out oh you just bring marshadow and you (7:03 - 7:06)
spectral thief and you just take all (7:05 - 7:07)
Mewtwo's Buffs you don't have to worry (7:06 - 7:09)
about that anymore but there's besides (7:07 - 7:10)
Charizard there's was plenty of other (7:09 - 7:13)
six star raids where it's like probably (7:10 - 7:14)
have to bring a taunter or probably have (7:13 - 7:17)
to bring a clear smogger or maybe we (7:14 - 7:19)
should run electric terrain because this (7:17 - 7:23)
Pokemon just keeps spamming sing (7:19 - 7:26)
against us (7:23 - 7:30)
so I'm I'm I'm a big fan (7:26 - 7:35)
I am mixed on it the thing is is that (7:30 - 7:37)
I get the most weird bugs while in these (7:35 - 7:38)
raids (7:37 - 7:40)
so (7:38 - 7:42)
it's hard for me to say like it's better (7:40 - 7:46)
since half of my experiences are awful (7:42 - 7:48)
where I don't know what's happening I'm (7:46 - 7:52)
stuck in a menu uh I am sometimes stuck (7:48 - 7:54)
for multiple terms where I'm just not (7:52 - 7:57)
allowed to do anything because something (7:54 - 7:59)
is happening that I'm not allowed also (7:57 - 8:01)
to see it because the camera froze (7:59 - 8:03)
somewhere so I have no clue what's going (8:01 - 8:05)
on (8:03 - 8:07)
um I think I will have a better opinion (8:05 - 8:10)
of them once the bugs are fixed but (8:07 - 8:14)
right now like if if the real time (8:10 - 8:17)
system means I have to deal with 50 of (8:14 - 8:20)
my raids being subpar no thank you (8:17 - 8:24)
they're kind of visually confusing (8:20 - 8:27)
like it's hard to say go and do a cheer (8:24 - 8:31)
or go do a heel when I can't see (8:27 - 8:34)
at all what's happening to anybody else (8:31 - 8:36)
because it's frozen out yeah I think (8:34 - 8:38)
maybe I've had (8:36 - 8:40)
more (8:38 - 8:42)
uh what's the word for it (8:40 - 8:45)
because I've done so many I know what's (8:42 - 8:46)
like about to happen or not about to (8:45 - 8:48)
happen and maybe I just have a higher (8:46 - 8:50)
tolerance for that kind of stuff because (8:48 - 8:53)
uh one I've done it enough but two you (8:50 - 8:55)
know it's funny how we talk about how (8:53 - 8:58)
broken Pokemon games are but like (8:55 - 9:01)
it doesn't excuse it but they're like (8:58 - 9:03)
other mainstream games that are just (9:01 - 9:05)
terribly broken as well like Call of (9:03 - 9:08)
Duty is constantly broken The Sims is (9:05 - 9:10)
constantly broken I was a big Destiny (9:08 - 9:12)
Destiny player Destiny was constantly (9:10 - 9:13)
broken (9:12 - 9:17)
um there was a raid in Destiny 2 (9:13 - 9:21)
um where the final part of the raid you (9:17 - 9:23)
had to uh (9:21 - 9:25)
there were these invisible little walls (9:23 - 9:29)
and in the sky a symbol would appear and (9:25 - 9:30)
you would have to call out the symbol (9:29 - 9:32)
and there was three people in this room (9:30 - 9:34)
where the symbol would appear and then (9:32 - 9:35)
three people in the other room so the (9:34 - 9:37)
three people in the room would have to (9:35 - 9:38)
call out the symbol that they saw for (9:37 - 9:39)
the other three people in the room that (9:38 - 9:42)
was the Rave mechanic and then you had a (9:39 - 9:44)
timer and once that timer went down the (9:42 - 9:46)
little invisible wall dropped and you (9:44 - 9:48)
would move forward to the next invisible (9:46 - 9:50)
wall and then that would drop and then (9:48 - 9:53)
there was like three stacks of walls but (9:50 - 9:56)
that raid was broken for several months (9:53 - 9:59)
where sometimes your character just (9:56 - 10:01)
didn't accept the wall was there and you (9:59 - 10:03)
would just fly into space you were just (10:01 - 10:05)
gone yeah and you you would auto fail (10:03 - 10:08)
the The Raid because you needed to be (10:05 - 10:10)
alive each one step one step two step (10:08 - 10:12)
three and then get to the end and then (10:10 - 10:14)
you get you read you reunite with your (10:12 - 10:15)
team (10:14 - 10:17)
um and it was frustrating but you would (10:15 - 10:19)
sit there for two hours because like (10:17 - 10:21)
everyone is doing it what everyone needs (10:19 - 10:23)
to do and you you could do everything (10:21 - 10:26)
perfectly but sometimes the wall just (10:23 - 10:29)
didn't appear and you would die and your (10:26 - 10:31)
whole team would have to restart and I (10:29 - 10:34)
did that for weeks where I was like I (10:31 - 10:35)
love doing this raid this raid is (10:34 - 10:37)
incredible everyone's having fun but we (10:35 - 10:39)
literally cannot beat it because like (10:37 - 10:42)
we're hoping that everything doesn't bug (10:39 - 10:45)
out and that's kind of how I'm feeling (10:42 - 10:47)
with Scarlet except not as bad right (10:45 - 10:49)
because one is like a two hour process (10:47 - 10:52)
right the other one is about having a (10:49 - 10:55)
seven minute process I've lived through (10:52 - 10:59)
so many bad betas that like (10:55 - 11:01)
when whatever (10:59 - 11:03)
I forget what World of Warcraft thing (11:01 - 11:05)
launched that literally you'd Zone in (11:03 - 11:07)
and the entire game would crash (11:05 - 11:09)
uh because there were so many people and (11:07 - 11:13)
it was so broken that I just don't (11:09 - 11:16)
do them I'm like nah I I this has cured (11:13 - 11:18)
me of wanting to be the first at doing (11:16 - 11:21)
anything because this experience makes (11:18 - 11:24)
me hate this game like me having to (11:21 - 11:27)
struggle through your bugs does not make (11:24 - 11:30)
me want to play your game so I will come (11:27 - 11:32)
back I will come back in a month and I (11:30 - 11:34)
hope it's better otherwise I will write (11:32 - 11:36)
your game off but you can't come back (11:34 - 11:38)
for Charizard he's gone all right yeah (11:36 - 11:42)
well like okay like there's there's a (11:38 - 11:44)
there is a part in me that has been (11:42 - 11:48)
instilled over many buggy bad games that (11:44 - 11:50)
I'm like you know how many Charizards I (11:48 - 11:53)
have at this point you don't have one (11:50 - 11:55)
with a mighty Mark I don't care I don't (11:53 - 11:58)
I don't care if somebody a Mark that (11:55 - 12:00)
only matters to me and like four other (11:58 - 12:02)
people (12:00 - 12:04)
you could literally say the same thing (12:02 - 12:05)
about any other opponent like every (12:04 - 12:09)
single Pokemon right so it that doesn't (12:05 - 12:12)
it's not a draw for me anymore like if (12:09 - 12:15)
you're if your experience is bad I'm out (12:12 - 12:18)
like I I don't want to wait there are so (12:15 - 12:21)
many other games that are working that (12:18 - 12:23)
are fun to do that I don't want to waste (12:21 - 12:24)
my time (12:23 - 12:27)
here and that's been my problem post (12:24 - 12:28)
game (12:27 - 12:30)
being still connected with scarlet and (12:28 - 12:32)
violet is so many of the things you do (12:30 - 12:34)
post game for me are still so buggy that (12:32 - 12:38)
I'm like do I want to be frustrated for (12:34 - 12:40)
an evening or do I want to go do (12:38 - 12:42)
something else and the answer is I want (12:40 - 12:44)
to go do something else (12:42 - 12:46)
I will say I haven't had it crash yet (12:44 - 12:47)
still (12:46 - 12:49)
played scarlet and violet more than I (12:47 - 12:51)
played sword and shield I am over the (12:49 - 12:52)
number of hours I have on sword and (12:51 - 12:54)
shield at this point (12:52 - 12:56)
um still no crashes I've had a couple of (12:54 - 12:59)
those raid bugs you've mentioned but the (12:56 - 13:00)
game (12:59 - 13:02)
is all right for me other than the (13:00 - 13:05)
couple of uh bugs where I had to restart (13:02 - 13:08)
in the very beginning it it's all right (13:05 - 13:11)
I've had a lot of crashes unfortunately (13:08 - 13:14)
yeah I mean I've I'm I'm what like 150 (13:11 - 13:17)
hours in I've had five crashes I think (13:14 - 13:19)
um I still absolutely love the game uh I (13:17 - 13:23)
think if it if it had the stability of (13:19 - 13:25)
sword and shield uh you would probably (13:23 - 13:27)
already be better than sword and shield (13:25 - 13:30)
for me uh just because of (13:27 - 13:31)
everything about it is really really (13:30 - 13:34)
great minus you know the frame rate and (13:31 - 13:38)
it's ugly and but like you know that can (13:34 - 13:39)
be fixed (13:38 - 13:42)
they've acknowledged that so whether or (13:39 - 13:44)
not they fix it to I don't think they're (13:42 - 13:47)
gonna like fix it to the point where (13:44 - 13:48)
I don't know the game suddenly looks (13:47 - 13:50)
like twice as good right like I don't (13:48 - 13:52)
think that on the map fix is coming but (13:50 - 13:54)
I I think the (13:52 - 13:57)
I think if they if they can if they can (13:54 - 13:58)
fix the frame rate to the point where I (13:57 - 14:03)
can switch it back from 720 to 1080. uh (13:58 - 14:05)
and it will run smoothly I will be very (14:03 - 14:07)
very happy mm-hmm (14:05 - 14:09)
I don't think the game's gonna magically (14:07 - 14:11)
look better (14:09 - 14:11)
but I think the game looks fine right (14:11 - 14:16)
like (14:14 - 14:17)
I'm not I'm not there for it's (14:16 - 14:22)
award-winning Vistas yeah I mean but I I (14:17 - 14:24)
would like it so that when I'm looking (14:22 - 14:26)
at your non-award-winning business I'm (14:24 - 14:28)
not also forced to look at a blank space (14:26 - 14:29)
underneath (14:28 - 14:31)
sometimes you always gotta check under (14:29 - 14:33)
the ground you got to see what's down (14:31 - 14:35)
there sometimes I mean if it's not gonna (14:33 - 14:37)
show me what's the other part of Wiglet (14:35 - 14:38)

here's some coins (18:32 - 18:36)
the wash the wushu Pokemon urshifu has (18:38 - 18:43)
entered battle is that out now I don't (18:41 - 18:45)
see a date or shifu's here right no yeah (18:43 - 18:48)
isn't it yeah he's already in I think I (18:45 - 18:51)
think so I think so yeah I think it just (18:48 - 18:52)
came out (18:51 - 18:54)
uh hershifu is an all-arounder that can (18:52 - 18:56)
be played two different ways if you move (18:54 - 18:58)
the if you learn the move Wicked blow as (18:56 - 19:00)
Cub Food Cub Food will evolve into (18:58 - 19:03)
single uh strike and if you learn (19:00 - 19:05)
surging strikes you will evolve into (19:03 - 19:08)
Rapid Strike or Shifu (19:05 - 19:09)
there are two new held items coming (19:08 - 19:12)
rapid fire scarf which increases your (19:09 - 19:14)
Pokemon's attack speed for a short time (19:12 - 19:17)
after three basic attacks this effect I (19:14 - 19:20)
wonder if that's good for uh camera this (19:17 - 19:22)
effect uh goes on cooldown every time (19:20 - 19:26)
it's triggered drain Crown restores HP (19:22 - 19:28)
equal to a portion of damage dealt with (19:26 - 19:32)
attack based attacks boy they're (19:28 - 19:34)
the way they name stuff attack based (19:32 - 19:36)
attack (19:34 - 19:36)
they'd name it though because it's a (19:38 - 19:44)
very specific it's very very specific (19:39 - 19:47)
because it's not special attack based (19:44 - 19:49)
attacks yes (19:47 - 19:52)
so they have to say it's attack based (19:49 - 19:55)
attacks you know attack if only we could (19:52 - 19:56)
have solved that problem of special (19:55 - 20:00)
attacks and physical attacks and (19:56 - 20:02)
if only there was another game that kind (20:00 - 20:04)
of figured that out (20:02 - 20:05)
well isn't it there's something weird in (20:04 - 20:09)
unite where like your attack your basic (20:05 - 20:12)
attacks are always attack but sometimes (20:09 - 20:14)
you're (20:12 - 20:18)
other attacks are special (20:14 - 20:18)
yeah (20:18 - 20:23)
the like the Deep the Deep numbers of (20:20 - 20:29)
Pokemon unite are for the truly Brave (20:23 - 20:29)
it's really dedicated I will I'll deal (20:29 - 20:34)
with the Charizard HP button instead of (20:32 - 20:37)
trying to figure out (20:34 - 20:37)
um (20:38 - 20:41)
yeah okay so there's there's a lot (20:39 - 20:43)
coming to unite (20:41 - 20:44)
um (20:43 - 20:47)
I don't I don't know you know this is (20:44 - 20:49)
not the first game to do like sign in (20:47 - 20:52)
and pick a side and have fun kind of (20:49 - 20:54)
system but (20:52 - 20:56)
I don't know if that's enough for me to (20:54 - 20:58)
put down scarlet and violet to be like (20:56 - 21:01)
yeah let me jump back into the I still (20:58 - 21:03)
don't like that new map I just I can't (21:01 - 21:06)
really (21:03 - 21:09)
I don't know I haven't played since (21:06 - 21:13)
the changes to Rayquaza Within (21:09 - 21:15)
and I think it's I think it's worse now (21:13 - 21:19)
because I I because they made Rayquaza (21:15 - 21:21)
more like Zapdos the last time I had (21:19 - 21:24)
checked in and ultimately that's a worse (21:21 - 21:28)
that has a much worse decision (21:24 - 21:28)
I logged in like three days ago (21:30 - 21:37)
and it said like welcome back Steve (21:33 - 21:39)
here's a bunch of points play a match (21:37 - 21:41)
and I was like all right I guess I'll (21:39 - 21:43)
play a match it was like 3 000 coins or (21:41 - 21:46)
whatever like a decent amount (21:43 - 21:48)
um (21:46 - 21:51)
and oh you know why I logged in because (21:48 - 21:54)
there was that code yeah (21:51 - 21:57)
however many downloads yeah so so unite (21:54 - 22:00)
hit uh 100 100 million million which is (21:57 - 22:06)
a lot about a ton uh very very very much (22:00 - 22:09)
um so you you got you got a thousand (22:06 - 22:11)
coins and then you got a gold emblem and (22:09 - 22:13)
I was like oh gold item that gold (22:11 - 22:15)
emblems worth logging in for I think (22:13 - 22:17)
so I logged in redeemed it I forgot when (22:15 - 22:19)
you redeemed something unite it takes (22:17 - 22:21)
like for whatever reason it takes like (22:19 - 22:23)
an hour for it to get to you you don't (22:21 - 22:24)
get it instantly it's like check your (22:23 - 22:28)
mailbox in some period of time like okay (22:24 - 22:31)
instantly I returned it this morning (22:28 - 22:33)
I redeemed it right when it like came (22:31 - 22:34)
out and it was like check your mailbox (22:33 - 22:36)
and I did a match and I came back and I (22:34 - 22:38)
was like I still don't have it yet (22:36 - 22:40)
I probably do have it now I don't know (22:38 - 22:43)
where my switch is but I did a match and (22:40 - 22:45)
it reminded me of like oh yeah I don't (22:43 - 22:47)
like this map oh you gave me Bots I did (22:45 - 22:49)
a ranked match but it gave me Bots oh (22:47 - 22:51)
yeah yeah and I was like oh yeah I still (22:49 - 22:53)
don't really love this match although I (22:51 - 22:54)
noticed uh this must be new since when I (22:53 - 22:58)
logged in Greg I noticed uh the opposing (22:54 - 23:00)
team took (22:58 - 23:04)
Reggie alecky and then we defeated it (23:00 - 23:05)
and instead of dying he just turned (23:04 - 23:07)
around and started going the other way (23:05 - 23:09)
and I was like oh that oh I haven't seen (23:07 - 23:11)
that I was like oh he's not dead he's (23:09 - 23:14)
just now on our team uh it was it was (23:11 - 23:15)
weird because yeah I don't know if that (23:14 - 23:17)
was bug or what happened there but I (23:15 - 23:18)
don't know I haven't I haven't played (23:17 - 23:20)
since (23:18 - 23:21)
Thanksgiving so I know a bunch of (23:20 - 23:23)
changes have gone in I need to go in and (23:21 - 23:25)
buy my Sable eye I need to go in and (23:23 - 23:28)
check things but generally I think a lot (23:25 - 23:30)
of people were frustrated with a lot of (23:28 - 23:33)
the changes that they put in (23:30 - 23:34)
um (23:33 - 23:38)
I overall I like the Rayquaza map a lot (23:34 - 23:40)
better than the Zapdos map (23:38 - 23:42)
but I also didn't spend very much time (23:40 - 23:44)
on the Zapdos map (23:42 - 23:47)
but as they sort of make things more (23:44 - 23:49)
like Zapdos like the changes that you (23:47 - 23:52)
put in were positive and made the games (23:49 - 23:56)
feel more competitive but (23:52 - 24:00)
if if request is as it was (23:56 - 24:02)
according to the few changes that I saw (24:00 - 24:04)
where it boosts the people that win the (24:02 - 24:07)
who beat Rayquaza so much that it might (24:04 - 24:09)
as well just be (24:07 - 24:12)
another Zapdos that that is generally a (24:09 - 24:14)
bad turn for that game well I felt like (24:12 - 24:16)
when I played before I was like I don't (24:14 - 24:18)
like this map (24:16 - 24:19)
because I was still playing a lot when (24:18 - 24:20)
they switched over I felt like no one (24:19 - 24:22)
even just went for it it was like oh it (24:20 - 24:24)
wasn't worth it (24:22 - 24:25)
I feel like you can move around faster (24:24 - 24:28)
maybe that's just me I go for this the (24:25 - 24:29)
characters and I always feel like you (24:28 - 24:31)
can move around faster in the new map (24:29 - 24:32)
than the old one you can move around (24:31 - 24:33)
fast so there's more experience on the (24:32 - 24:35)
map in the new map there's a lot more (24:33 - 24:37)
experience in the new map (24:35 - 24:40)
um the thing is is that (24:37 - 24:43)
if you're behind it was important to go (24:40 - 24:45)
to Rayquaza because you do get a boost (24:43 - 24:49)
as far as taking down the other team and (24:45 - 24:53)
a scoring boost but it was stoppable the (24:49 - 24:55)
way they had changed it or proposed (24:53 - 24:56)
change it again I haven't played in a (24:55 - 24:59)
month was they increased the Boost the (24:56 - 25:01)
scarring speed was almost instant again (24:59 - 25:04)
so (25:01 - 25:06)
it went back to nothing matters until (25:04 - 25:08)
the last two minutes (25:06 - 25:11)
and now whoever gets Rayquaza can win (25:08 - 25:13)
the game again whereas before it was (25:11 - 25:15)
like there was actually a battle over (25:13 - 25:17)
here it was important to stop the team (25:15 - 25:18)
that was from behind from getting (25:17 - 25:21)
Rayquaza because it it did put you (25:18 - 25:22)
behind the eight ball especially if it (25:21 - 25:26)
was close and now it's sort of back to (25:22 - 25:29)
nothing matters as much until (25:26 - 25:31)
the last two minutes of the game which (25:29 - 25:32)
is not a good (25:31 - 25:36)
it's not a good look for that game (25:32 - 25:36)
I want to say that (25:36 - 25:40)
again I played three days ago and it was (25:38 - 25:41)
just against bots and I just did it for (25:40 - 25:42)
the coin so I wasn't paying too much (25:41 - 25:44)
attention once I realized it was a bot (25:42 - 25:45)
match I was like I can kind of check out (25:44 - 25:47)
here (25:45 - 25:49)
well you have to have good Buzz because (25:47 - 25:50)
sometimes you get a bot batchel like I (25:49 - 25:52)
checked out and I well I lost because (25:50 - 25:55)
yeah they don't do anything matches is (25:52 - 25:58)
you at least again I I've played a lot (25:55 - 26:00)
at the start of when they switch maps (25:58 - 26:02)
and then just recently is as long as you (26:00 - 26:04)
stay in your lane it's fine whereas in (26:02 - 26:07)
like the first map you couldn't see like (26:04 - 26:09)
you had to be like I'm going everywhere (26:07 - 26:10)
and then they kind of punished you for (26:09 - 26:11)
that of like (26:10 - 26:13)
if you don't stay in your lanes the Bots (26:11 - 26:17)
are gonna get revolt against you yeah (26:13 - 26:17)
um but I I feel like I recall when I not (26:18 - 26:22)
again I could be wrong when I knocked (26:20 - 26:24)
out Rayquaza I was able to dunk pretty (26:22 - 26:27)
instantly it felt way faster but yeah I (26:24 - 26:29)
picked up a bunch of stuff to dunk again (26:27 - 26:31)
and it felt normal which is technically (26:29 - 26:35)
different yeah yeah so the idea is from (26:31 - 26:37)
I understand is the first (26:35 - 26:41)
it speeds up your first Big Score but (26:37 - 26:44)
when you're playing against other people (26:41 - 26:48)
the that first big score is the decider (26:44 - 26:50)
because everybody will have 50 at that (26:48 - 26:51)
point and there's not a way to come back (26:50 - 26:54)
from that whereas before that change (26:51 - 26:56)
even while they were scoring you had a (26:54 - 26:58)
chance to break their shield and stop (26:56 - 27:00)
them because once that Shield was gone (26:58 - 27:04)
the boosts were gone and so you could (27:00 - 27:07)
even if you were behind and like you (27:04 - 27:09)
could still catch up or if it was a (27:07 - 27:10)
close match and you were slightly ahead (27:09 - 27:13)
you could have a chance at stopping the (27:10 - 27:15)
other team from scoring and that's gone (27:13 - 27:19)
which is worse (27:15 - 27:19)
look I really like Dragon pulp I really (27:20 - 27:25)
like Hershey food (27:22 - 27:28)
both are both are are Pokemon that (27:25 - 27:30)
normally would bring me back to these (27:28 - 27:32)
games instantly if I don't know a brand (27:30 - 27:34)
new Pokemon game didn't come out that I (27:32 - 27:35)
want to play more (27:34 - 27:39)
um I'd be curious what the first gen 9 (27:35 - 27:42)
Pokemon would be (27:39 - 27:44)
uh because I and and for the record (27:42 - 27:46)
there's no way that gold Dango doesn't (27:44 - 27:47)
make it into this game right or golden (27:46 - 27:50)
take Italian or a revolt like like that (27:47 - 27:52)
like they're they're when when they (27:50 - 27:54)
whenever the Pokemon company decides to (27:52 - 27:55)
celebrate that this is the 1000th (27:54 - 27:58)
Pokemon which they will in some capacity (27:55 - 28:00)
there's no way they don't put that into (27:58 - 28:02)
well I guess the the time they (28:00 - 28:04)
celebrated is probably when that Pokemon (28:02 - 28:06)
go event is supposedly supposed to (28:04 - 28:08)
happen yeah (28:06 - 28:09)
um (28:08 - 28:11)
but yeah I'm curious what the first gen (28:09 - 28:13)
nine you know I kind of wouldn't be (28:11 - 28:16)
upset with spite Ops (28:13 - 28:16)
but the little the thing before it like (28:17 - 28:22)
watching him like crawl the little (28:20 - 28:23)
spider bug I think would look really (28:22 - 28:25)
cute (28:23 - 28:27)
I feel like spite Ops would work as like (28:25 - 28:29)
a Defender right with like the webs (28:27 - 28:33)
like I I can see why it would go into (28:29 - 28:35)
the game I don't want it though (28:33 - 28:38)
it's already ruining one game for me (28:35 - 28:40)
please don't ruin two I do like him and (28:38 - 28:42)
Scarlet and violet when you're like in a (28:40 - 28:43)
battle and he's like trying to sneak (28:42 - 28:45)
behind you and you're like man I see you (28:43 - 28:48)
stop doing that sneak thing stop (28:45 - 28:51)
sneaking also why is once again a (28:48 - 28:53)
Psyduck behind me staring at me like a (28:51 - 28:56)
creeper please go away (28:53 - 29:00)
what what gen 9 Pokemon would like not (28:56 - 29:02)
besides favorites like just mechanically (29:00 - 29:06)
what gen 9 Pokemon would you want (29:02 - 29:06)
because it's easier to say favorites (29:07 - 29:10)
that's why I said spy tops because I (29:09 - 29:12)
think the web stuff would work ideally (29:10 - 29:15)
for like a Defender role (29:12 - 29:15)
I don't think Volusia is gonna work no (29:17 - 29:22)
nope (29:20 - 29:24)
I mean I can only think of a Pokemon (29:22 - 29:27)
that I like to because I like Fast (29:24 - 29:29)
Pokemon and that holds over both in the (29:27 - 29:33)
main Series game stand in Pokemon Unite (29:29 - 29:33)
and mascarata is fast and I think that (29:34 - 29:37)
they would like to add it in game to go (29:36 - 29:39)
along with all of the other Pokemon that (29:37 - 29:40)
kind of move that way that kind of look (29:39 - 29:42)
that way I think it would look good as a (29:40 - 29:44)
unite model (29:42 - 29:44)
um I think (29:45 - 29:50)
uh uh I think Pammy they would happy go (29:47 - 29:54)
for as another as another Speedster we (29:50 - 29:56)
don't really have like the only other (29:54 - 29:59)
one that's like Zoro matches that a (29:56 - 30:00)
little bit I could see that I could (29:59 - 30:03)
actually see nimble (30:00 - 30:06)
in there the better bug (30:03 - 30:08)
um (30:06 - 30:08)
yeah I can see that that one really (30:08 - 30:13)
easily (30:11 - 30:15)
hmm (30:13 - 30:17)
I mean I would I would want tinkerton in (30:15 - 30:18)
there I think that is the three (30:17 - 30:20)
evolution that they could they could get (30:18 - 30:21)
away with oh yeah I think a tongue super (30:20 - 30:23)
Works (30:21 - 30:25)
um although I would argue that probably (30:23 - 30:27)
one of the first ones they might go with (30:25 - 30:29)
simply because it could be a Lucario (30:27 - 30:32)
match is flamigo (30:29 - 30:34)
um they like adding simple non-evolution (30:32 - 30:36)
ones that are just like it just levels (30:34 - 30:38)
up and go and fight (30:36 - 30:40)
um so I could see them making that an (30:38 - 30:41)
attacker (30:40 - 30:43)
uh (30:41 - 30:46)
uh I would (30:43 - 30:49)
I would now assume that they could (30:46 - 30:52)
easily get a (30:49 - 30:55)
primeape evolution in like the whole (30:52 - 30:58)
Bank annihilate would also be good that (30:55 - 31:00)
like they they have a huge thing there (30:58 - 31:03)
it would be like a Gardevoir (31:00 - 31:05)
you know have to get it to level nine (31:03 - 31:06)
but then once it's there like another (31:05 - 31:09)
Tyranitar situation where like it's hard (31:06 - 31:11)
to get it there but once it's there it (31:09 - 31:15)
it is hard to deal with (31:11 - 31:17)
I like these choices (31:15 - 31:20)
uh I also like taking breaks so we will (31:17 - 31:21)
uh take a break real quick when we come (31:20 - 31:23)
back we're gonna talk about the anime (31:21 - 31:25)
stuff that was announced (31:23 - 31:27)
um and then we'll talk about the Pokemon (31:25 - 31:30)
Go stuff announced uh we will be right (31:27 - 31:32)
back (31:30 - 31:35)
and we are back from our break (31:32 - 31:38)
uh okay we got some big news (31:35 - 31:41)
some big news uh (31:38 - 31:45)
this is off I okay the big news is off a (31:41 - 31:47)
lot of places this is everywhere yeah (31:45 - 31:50)
also I kept hearing Rico and all three (31:47 - 31:55)
of these articles say liko yes it is a (31:50 - 31:57)
Japanese uh translation I went and (31:55 - 31:59)
looked up the direct website that TV (31:57 - 32:01)
Tokyo put out since they put out an (31:59 - 32:04)
English translation as well (32:01 - 32:08)
um so in Japanese it could it is um Rico (32:04 - 32:12)
and Roy uh they've decided to translate (32:08 - 32:15)
it with an L for Rico so that's liko and (32:12 - 32:18)
Roy yeah and so the official Pokemon (32:15 - 32:23)
website is using Lika with an L but I (32:18 - 32:25)
was like I felt like I was gaslit all (32:23 - 32:27)
weekend into thinking it was real well (32:25 - 32:30)
that the issue is of course like the L (32:27 - 32:32)
and the r in Japanese yeah totally (32:30 - 32:34)
exists the same so you don't know how (32:32 - 32:36)
they're gonna until they state which way (32:34 - 32:39)
they're going is like it could be either (32:36 - 32:42)
ah but you know we have a Kotaku we have (32:39 - 32:45)
a a DEX we have a we have official (32:42 - 32:47)
Pokemon they're all saying liko uh what (32:45 - 32:50)
whatever that's the Japanese version it (32:47 - 32:52)
is still possible that the American (32:50 - 32:54)
version they just switch up the names as (32:52 - 32:57)
well again they could they did that also (32:54 - 33:00)
what was that bad movie Greg (32:57 - 33:02)
uh Power of us yes (33:00 - 33:05)
well so her name was (33:02 - 33:07)
Risa (33:05 - 33:10)
yeah it was Risa but in Japanese it was (33:07 - 33:11)
Lisa (33:10 - 33:14)
so again it's the same problem it could (33:11 - 33:18)
be Lisa or Risa and they chose Risa (33:14 - 33:21)
instead of Lisa and it's one of the (33:18 - 33:23)
things where it's like why would you (33:21 - 33:24)
pick Lisa because that is actually a (33:23 - 33:26)
name a lot of people know in the English (33:24 - 33:29)
world yeah and Risa just sounds weird (33:26 - 33:31)
and makes everybody think (33:29 - 33:33)
did you mean Lisa (33:31 - 33:38)
anyway decision movie is bad who cares (33:33 - 33:40)
that was the least of the poor choices (33:38 - 33:43)
you made in that movie (33:40 - 33:45)
um so yeah you know will was on when we (33:43 - 33:49)
we talked about this uh I mean the the (33:45 - 33:51)
elephant in the room is uh they're done (33:49 - 33:52)
with Ash (33:51 - 33:55)
I think uh I think uh well they're not (33:52 - 33:57)
let's be real here (33:55 - 33:59)
um we'll get there they are not done (33:57 - 34:02)
they are not done with Ash we'll get to (33:59 - 34:04)
that part but you know Greg will and (34:02 - 34:07)
myself all wrong uh you know we all we (34:04 - 34:08)
all confidently sat in the show and (34:07 - 34:09)
we're like they're not getting rid of (34:08 - 34:10)
Ash (34:09 - 34:12)
asterisks there because I still don't (34:10 - 34:13)
think they are getting rid of Ash but (34:12 - 34:15)
they're at least doing a brand new anime (34:13 - 34:19)
series here uh without Ash that isn't (34:15 - 34:21)
you know going direct to YouTube (34:19 - 34:25)
right I mean let's I'll put it this way (34:21 - 34:27)
they are doing an anime series where Ash (34:25 - 34:29)
is not the star (34:27 - 34:31)
yes (34:29 - 34:33)
but again well I think we should Circle (34:31 - 34:36)
back to this uh okay and I uh Greg might (34:33 - 34:39)
be more of an anime expert than I am but (34:36 - 34:42)
I I I still don't think uh Ash is gone (34:39 - 34:44)
here uh this is let's do the press (34:42 - 34:46)
release we'll talk about it the Pokemon (34:44 - 34:49)
company group I don't know why if this (34:46 - 34:50)
pokemon.com the Pokemon company group (34:49 - 34:52)

dual protagonists named liko and Roy in (34:57 - 35:02)

yeah differently as they set off on an (35:04 - 35:08)
action-packed adventure across the (35:06 - 35:10)

supposed to be 11 episodes after yeah (36:40 - 36:46)
they think they said 11. the forthcoming (36:43 - 36:48)
special episodes not only celebrate (36:46 - 36:50)
Ash's Memento Monumental achievements (36:48 - 36:52)

everything they love about Pokemon (37:02 - 37:06)
animation including action adventure (37:03 - 37:08)
friendship and Pokemon (37:06 - 37:10)
uh so that's the official press release (37:08 - 37:11)
there (37:10 - 37:14)
so if you're not following uh because (37:11 - 37:16)
there was a lot of news that happened (37:14 - 37:20)
all at once is Japan is pretty much done (37:16 - 37:22)
they've wrapped up uh that there was (37:20 - 37:25)
never a new Eevee spoiler the EV just (37:22 - 37:28)
stayed as an Eevee uh (37:25 - 37:30)
missed opportunity yeah you know you (37:28 - 37:32)
would think the the Scarlet Violet video (37:30 - 37:33)
games would have confirmed that but (37:32 - 37:35)
there's no new Eevee (37:33 - 37:36)
um (37:35 - 37:39)
and then so that's wrapped up we still (37:36 - 37:42)
don't have those episodes in English so (37:39 - 37:44)
I I think we talked about this I don't (37:42 - 37:46)
remember if Greg was on that episode or (37:44 - 37:48)
not but it just it to me it always felt (37:46 - 37:50)
like it did feel like weird of like I'm (37:48 - 37:52)
supposed to be sad but also you haven't (37:50 - 37:54)
given me the episodes to consume to be (37:52 - 37:57)
said yeah (37:54 - 37:59)
and I again I think this also hits (37:57 - 38:01)
people like I think this hits a lot of (37:59 - 38:04)
people different like for me who came to (38:01 - 38:07)
the anime at age 28 like this isn't a (38:04 - 38:10)
part of my childhood this just (38:07 - 38:13)
it makes sense after 25 years that (38:10 - 38:19)
as as a brand and as a continual growth (38:13 - 38:21)
that you need to (38:19 - 38:24)
reset right like even The Simpsons is (38:21 - 38:26)
like log into the tooth and people are (38:24 - 38:29)
like okay we're kind of done and in (38:26 - 38:31)
comic books about every 25 years they're (38:29 - 38:33)
like we need a reboot we need to we need (38:31 - 38:36)
I do a fresh take on characters look (38:33 - 38:38)
Batman Beyond was bad (38:36 - 38:40)
Batman was great what are you talking (38:38 - 38:45)
about as a kid I hated Batman Beyond I (38:40 - 38:48)
also don't like superheroes yeah so I I (38:45 - 38:50)
really as a kid I really loved um the (38:48 - 38:52)
the good Batman the Batman that everyone (38:50 - 38:53)
loves Batman the enemy series is (38:52 - 38:55)
brilliant yeah yeah and so we're never (38:53 - 38:57)
gonna they were they were announcing (38:55 - 38:59)
Batman Beyond I was like really excited (38:57 - 39:01)
and then that was like the first time as (38:59 - 39:03)
a kid I was like Oh I thought I was (39:01 - 39:05)
supposed to like all cartoons because (39:03 - 39:07)
like no but I yeah I did not like Batman (39:05 - 39:08)
Beyond as a kid I'm sure it's actually (39:07 - 39:10)
pretty good but Batman is not as really (39:08 - 39:13)
good but (39:10 - 39:13)
they're really short-changed a lot of (39:13 - 39:19)
the story lines and also you really had (39:17 - 39:22)
to understand a lot of what happened to (39:19 - 39:24)
Batman Avengers for some of the stuff (39:22 - 39:25)
they did in Batman Beyond to even make (39:24 - 39:28)
sense you're like (39:25 - 39:30)
because you'd only watched Batman being (39:28 - 39:34)
like who is this old lady (39:30 - 39:34)
why is she important why why do I care (39:34 - 39:42)
like it was it was a weird it was like a (39:39 - 39:44)
weird sequel Standalone and they didn't (39:42 - 39:46)
do it very well but I think overall if (39:44 - 39:48)
you are a fan of both and you watch it (39:46 - 39:49)
now you're like okay I get why Batman (39:48 - 39:52)
Beyond was important and what they were (39:49 - 39:54)
doing it makes more sense to you as an (39:52 - 39:55)
adult than it would have ever made as a (39:54 - 39:57)
kid (39:55 - 39:59)
yeah I think I think I I mean I was (39:57 - 40:01)
pretty confident in them not dropping (39:59 - 40:03)
Ash because of (40:01 - 40:07)
you know they they still okay to be fair (40:03 - 40:08)
they still have not defined what a (40:07 - 40:11)
Pokemon Master was you know they did (40:08 - 40:13)
this for 25 years people would be like (40:11 - 40:15)
what are you doing Ash and he's like I'm (40:13 - 40:16)
gonna be a Pokemon master and they're (40:15 - 40:18)
like what does that even mean and every (40:16 - 40:21)
time he goes to explain it Team Rocket (40:18 - 40:23)
shows up our Pikachu electrocutes him or (40:21 - 40:25)
he falls off a cliff because he's Ash (40:23 - 40:27)
like something happens where he never (40:25 - 40:32)
defines it and so winning against Leon (40:27 - 40:32)
like it is if they would have said like (40:32 - 40:38)
becoming world champion you'd be like oh (40:36 - 40:40)
well he became world champion he's done (40:38 - 40:42)
like I'm pretty sure in one piece yeah I (40:40 - 40:43)
think they're trying to do in one piece (40:42 - 40:45)
is to find the one piece and you would (40:43 - 40:48)
probably know the show is over when they (40:45 - 40:50)
find the one piece they haven't done it (40:48 - 40:52)
yet but is it we don't know what the one (40:50 - 40:54)
piece is so how do we know the show's (40:52 - 40:56)
over when they find the one piece so it (40:54 - 40:58)
is a little weird that like they they (40:56 - 41:00)
have for 25 years been like Ash wants to (40:58 - 41:02)
be a Pokemon Master (41:00 - 41:05)
he wins a world championship that's not (41:02 - 41:07)
necessarily saying like (41:05 - 41:10)
he's a master right like well I think it (41:07 - 41:12)
was interesting in the trailer that the (41:10 - 41:16)
first thing they showed was Gary saying (41:12 - 41:19)
to Ash so (41:16 - 41:21)
are you close to being a Pokemon Master (41:19 - 41:23)
now (41:21 - 41:26)
and they cut to the look of like oh I (41:23 - 41:28)
actually have to think about this on (41:26 - 41:30)
Ash's face which is an interesting way (41:28 - 41:32)
to say (41:30 - 41:33)
like (41:32 - 41:36)
this is probably the first time he's had (41:33 - 41:38)
to like rethink his goals and I think (41:36 - 41:41)
there's 11 these 11 episodes is really (41:38 - 41:46)
sort of to say this is what Ash is going (41:41 - 41:49)
to focus on and it's going to take him (41:46 - 41:53)
away from what we want to focus on as an (41:49 - 41:56)
animated series (41:53 - 41:56)
I mean there's there's no (41:57 - 42:02)
there's no denying ashes (42:00 - 42:04)
a very talented trainer I mean people (42:02 - 42:07)
can always say like oh I hate Ash or Ash (42:04 - 42:09)
is so bad but like (42:07 - 42:11)
he's won a lot of matches he's qualified (42:09 - 42:12)
in a lot of tournaments that's that's (42:11 - 42:15)
more than you know somebody sitting at (42:12 - 42:17)
home with their switch can say right (42:15 - 42:18)
like I mean if I could break the rules (42:17 - 42:21)
that Ash does I could win a lot more too (42:18 - 42:23)
that's all I'm saying you just Gaslight (42:21 - 42:26)
all the judges yeah here's the thing A (42:23 - 42:29)
friend of mine once said about Dr Seuss (42:26 - 42:33)
and I feel this way about Ash he said I (42:29 - 42:35)
could be a great poet too if I could (42:33 - 42:37)
rhyme everything with words like gargle (42:35 - 42:39)
snoozer like if I could just make up the (42:37 - 42:42)
words I could be a great poet makeup (42:39 - 42:47)
make up the words I mean (42:42 - 42:50)
we're getting there it was weird to look (42:47 - 42:53)
at to watch the internet process these (42:50 - 42:55)
emotions right because we we've had so (42:53 - 42:58)
many years of people being like I just (42:55 - 42:59)
wish they would get rid of Ash I just (42:58 - 43:01)
wish they would start over I wish a (42:59 - 43:02)
reset and then all of a sudden you get (43:01 - 43:04)
like (43:02 - 43:06)
I'm not ready for this (43:04 - 43:08)
what's happening (43:06 - 43:09)
I mean I don't think they're the same (43:08 - 43:11)
people but these are the same people (43:09 - 43:14)
that are were mad that (43:11 - 43:16)
you know Han Solo died (43:14 - 43:19)
in the sequels spoiler alert that Luke (43:16 - 43:21)
Skywalker dies in The sequels like like (43:19 - 43:24)
if you thought about it like as a Die (43:21 - 43:25)
Hard saurus fan I'm like of course (43:24 - 43:27)
they're killing these characters off (43:25 - 43:29)
because they need to hey the actors are (43:27 - 43:31)
getting old and B they want to restart (43:29 - 43:32)
the franchise (43:31 - 43:35)
that's what you have to do like you if (43:32 - 43:37)
you want to get a fresh start if you (43:35 - 43:39)
want to be able to do things that break (43:37 - 43:43)
a pattern you do need to do some sort of (43:39 - 43:46)
reset and after 25 years (43:43 - 43:49)
you're gonna need to do a reset because (43:46 - 43:50)
you're kind of out of stories to tell (43:49 - 43:52)
about Ash (43:50 - 43:55)
I mean that's kind of the the the I (43:52 - 43:57)
think the thing that kills The Simpsons (43:55 - 43:59)
is like one of those actors dies right (43:57 - 44:01)
right (43:59 - 44:03)
um because I think I think that's part (44:01 - 44:05)
of the reason why the Simpsons is going (44:03 - 44:08)
for so long is you just have the same (44:05 - 44:09)
people and they're very good at what (44:08 - 44:11)
they're they're doing and they get paid (44:09 - 44:13)
very well and I'm sure Fox is still very (44:11 - 44:15)
happy with how many people watch The (44:13 - 44:17)
Simpsons and that stuff but like I feel (44:15 - 44:20)
like as soon as one of those actors (44:17 - 44:23)
goes like that show falls apart I don't (44:20 - 44:24)
know maybe they can I don't know there (44:23 - 44:26)
are a lot of talented voice acting (44:24 - 44:28)
people out there maybe they can replace (44:26 - 44:30)
it I mean look I live through the Darren (44:28 - 44:32)
switch of Bewitched where they just (44:30 - 44:33)
changed actors and didn't explain (44:32 - 44:36)
anything like people accept a lot here's (44:33 - 44:39)
here's the thing do you do you do you (44:36 - 44:41)
think they told Sarah (44:39 - 44:43)
do you think they gave her a heads up (44:41 - 44:45)
that like hey the character you played (44:43 - 44:51)
for 17 years is uh we're we're moving on (44:45 - 44:51)
the video she put out seemed pretty well (44:51 - 44:57)
done I don't think she could have done (44:54 - 44:58)
that video if she had been in emotions (44:57 - 45:00)
of learning that the character was going (44:58 - 45:03)
to be gone right then there is (45:00 - 45:08)
no actor in the world that doesn't know (45:03 - 45:10)
how to read a contract and a contract (45:08 - 45:12)
end date and as you're approaching that (45:10 - 45:16)
contract end date you're like (45:12 - 45:16)
um I don't have enough around the table (45:17 - 45:21)
I mean the other thing is is like I'm (45:19 - 45:25)
sure they informed them but also like (45:21 - 45:26)
people are like oh she's out of a job (45:25 - 45:28)
like she does a lot of Voice work like (45:26 - 45:29)
you're gonna retain them they're going (45:28 - 45:31)
to retain a person doing she does more (45:29 - 45:33)
voices on that than just ash like (45:31 - 45:35)
they're going to retain good vocal (45:33 - 45:36)
Talent like (45:35 - 45:38)
don't worry about her yes the the (45:36 - 45:42)
character is retiring I I know I come (45:38 - 45:43)
back voice acting is super hard to get (45:42 - 45:46)
into one she's already into it two she (45:43 - 45:48)
literally puts that she was Ash Ketchum (45:46 - 45:50)
on her resume and I'm I'm sure she is (45:48 - 45:54)
fine yeah yeah no I mean she is an (45:50 - 45:56)
established voice actor and that will (45:54 - 45:59)
carry you far and voice actors can get (45:56 - 46:01)
paid a lot it is not the highest paid (45:59 - 46:04)
acting job but if you can do multiple (46:01 - 46:08)
voices you get a lot of work so like (46:04 - 46:11)
it's much more about how many jobs you (46:08 - 46:13)
do get than how much you're paid for one (46:11 - 46:15)
individual job and I'm sure she's on the (46:13 - 46:17)
upper end at this point I mean 17 years (46:15 - 46:21)
one of the as a debatably one of the top (46:17 - 46:23)
10 most recognizable characters of all (46:21 - 46:24)
time yeah (46:23 - 46:26)
and and the fact that she can do (46:24 - 46:28)
multiple voices and people don't know (46:26 - 46:30)
that's the same voice is a huge (46:28 - 46:32)
commentary on how skilled she is yeah (46:30 - 46:34)
she does uh Delia (46:32 - 46:36)
um and then she does like a bunch of (46:34 - 46:39)
other Pokemon yeah voices as well (46:36 - 46:41)
and I'm sure she does other cartoons (46:39 - 46:42)
right like (46:41 - 46:45)
I'm sure there are other minor projects (46:42 - 46:47)
that she that she gets hired out for (46:45 - 46:48)
yeah (46:47 - 46:51)
um so you know going back to uh you know (46:48 - 46:54)
these two new characters there was for (46:51 - 46:56)
all of Pokemon Journeys for the last (46:54 - 46:57)
three years it was like they're (46:56 - 47:00)
replacing Ash with go and was like (46:57 - 47:02)
you know we sat on the show and I was (47:00 - 47:04)
like go is not an interesting enough (47:02 - 47:06)
character to carry the show (47:04 - 47:09)
I mean go is a great character uh I (47:06 - 47:11)
think I I would put go up there with the (47:09 - 47:13)
levels of I think a lot of people would (47:11 - 47:16)
would agree with me that you know Brock (47:13 - 47:18)
is this iconic character that people (47:16 - 47:20)
always want to see back you know they (47:18 - 47:24)
did bring back Brock for uh Diamond and (47:20 - 47:26)
Pearl stuff right (47:24 - 47:28)
yes he skipped the hole and stuff they (47:26 - 47:29)
they brought him back for Diamond and (47:28 - 47:32)
Pearl stuff I believe uh (47:29 - 47:34)
you know people love Misty people love (47:32 - 47:36)
Brock so people always got excited when (47:34 - 47:38)
Misty and Brock came back people love (47:36 - 47:41)
Gary uh I you know I don't know if (47:38 - 47:42)
people get excited if they brought Tracy (47:41 - 47:44)
back I'm sure five people out there (47:42 - 47:48)
would be excited for Tracy uh but like I (47:44 - 47:51)
think go is one of the better companions (47:48 - 47:53)
that Ash has had but you know go is a (47:51 - 47:55)
companion you know this isn't this isn't (47:53 - 47:57)
Friends where they make a spin-off show (47:55 - 48:00)
with Joey and hope it's like like that (47:57 - 48:02)
show was so bad though (48:00 - 48:06)
like like go just you know doesn't (48:02 - 48:09)
didn't you know go Brock Misty that I (48:06 - 48:11)
don't think they were ever good enough (48:09 - 48:12)
characters to have their own show they (48:11 - 48:14)
were good they were very very good (48:12 - 48:16)
companion characters if they never (48:14 - 48:18)
developed the characters to be good (48:16 - 48:20)
enough yeah and they would have had very (48:18 - 48:22)
different kinds of shows (48:20 - 48:26)
yeah like Joey I would watch I would (48:22 - 48:28)
watch uh Dr Brock in his rocket ship (48:26 - 48:29)
show (48:28 - 48:32)
I would watch that (48:29 - 48:32)
um (48:33 - 48:38)
there's a you know I saw a lot of like I (48:35 - 48:42)
hope that liko is Ash's daughter (48:38 - 48:45)
kind of thing which which I believe is a (48:42 - 48:47)
big anime Trope right of like we get rid (48:45 - 48:49)
of the main character but the new (48:47 - 48:52)
character is so and so's granddaughter (48:49 - 48:54)
daughter whatever (48:52 - 48:59)
I hope that that like I did I don't want (48:54 - 49:03)
it I don't I want a fresh start (48:59 - 49:05)
right like I don't want the whole like (49:03 - 49:07)
oh you're I don't want every episode (49:05 - 49:10)
where this character walks into a gym or (49:07 - 49:12)
a thing and like oh you're the daughter (49:10 - 49:15)
of Ash Ketchum like I just I'm already (49:12 - 49:18)
exhausted and it hasn't even started (49:15 - 49:18)
I mean but that's (49:20 - 49:24)
that's a thing in real life right like (49:22 - 49:26)
like (49:24 - 49:28)
that's also the thing is that's also a (49:26 - 49:30)
huge anime Trope so it depends on how (49:28 - 49:32)
trophy they're gonna go with this there (49:30 - 49:35)
is a basis for it yeah I don't want to (49:32 - 49:38)
use this for it yes they are going to go (49:35 - 49:42)
along the lines of (49:38 - 49:42)
hey this is Ash (49:43 - 49:48)
and this is Ash's kids and be like (49:45 - 49:52)
which of these Myriad of people did he (49:48 - 49:54)
actually marry and have a child with (49:52 - 49:58)
like that opens up a lot of dating Sim (49:54 - 49:59)
weirdness (49:58 - 50:03)
Greg Greg it's already there the I don't (49:59 - 50:06)
did I did I get hit in the head during X (50:03 - 50:09)
and Y where like where did all these (50:06 - 50:12)
Serena slash Ash shippers come from like (50:09 - 50:14)
yeah I get it like in the Japanese anime (50:12 - 50:16)
they like had a kiss and then in the (50:14 - 50:17)
English anime they like implied that (50:16 - 50:19)
they literally just cut the scene early (50:17 - 50:22)
like I get it but don't don't sit here (50:19 - 50:23)
and say like ash didn't have chemistry (50:22 - 50:27)
with a various amount of I mean (50:23 - 50:28)
characters throughout the years that's (50:27 - 50:30)
what I'm saying and really we know that (50:28 - 50:33)
the only person that he should be making (50:30 - 50:35)
an honorable connection with is Bianca (50:33 - 50:38)
because that's a legendary like what are (50:35 - 50:40)
you doing of your choices (50:38 - 50:42)
Bianca from black and white I was like I (50:40 - 50:44)
must have missed those black and white (50:42 - 50:46)
episodes nah this is Bianca the latius (50:44 - 50:48)
but here's the thing (50:46 - 50:51)
as much as Masters has said we're having (50:48 - 50:54)
a dating Sim and you can't stop us I (50:51 - 50:56)
don't think they want to open the doors (50:54 - 50:58)
of (50:56 - 51:01)
what what the official ship with Ash is (50:58 - 51:03)
I think they're gonna leave that over on (51:01 - 51:04)
the corner and I think they're going to (51:03 - 51:06)
have an older Ash come into the series (51:04 - 51:08)
every once in a while like because you (51:06 - 51:11)
need you need to for legal reasons to (51:08 - 51:13)
keep using your character or it falls (51:11 - 51:15)
into the public domain and they're not (51:13 - 51:17)
gonna allow that to happen (51:15 - 51:21)
so I think we will see Ash an older Ash (51:17 - 51:23)
up here eventually but when you say (51:21 - 51:26)
older do you mean like Digimon older (51:23 - 51:28)
which is Digimon they went like two to (51:26 - 51:30)
three years they went from like end of (51:28 - 51:32)
Middle School to like early high school (51:30 - 51:34)
or do you say like adult where Ash is (51:32 - 51:35)
like I don't carrying a brown paper bag (51:34 - 51:37)
with him I don't think they're gonna do (51:35 - 51:38)
adult (51:37 - 51:40)
right like I don't think they're gonna (51:38 - 51:42)
have Ash and Larry be good friends I (51:40 - 51:46)
think they're gonna do a dash (51:42 - 51:46)
Larry at the diner together just (51:54 - 52:00)
commiserating about what their life has (51:58 - 52:02)
become yeah I got a bunch of people (52:00 - 52:04)
wanting me to be champion of my my back (52:02 - 52:06)
hurts (52:04 - 52:09)
um no I think they would do a two or (52:06 - 52:13)
three years uh the famous Ash you know (52:09 - 52:16)
running around doing publicity battles (52:13 - 52:18)
stuff like that I think they would let (52:16 - 52:20)
him age a couple of years and have him (52:18 - 52:23)
appear and be like a Cynthia type figure (52:20 - 52:25)
who shows up right like well keep in (52:23 - 52:27)
mind if they when getting rid of Ash (52:25 - 52:30)
means they get rid of Pikachu (52:27 - 52:33)
right and I don't I I'm more concerned (52:30 - 52:33)
about (52:33 - 52:35)
how they're going to wedge Pikachu back (52:33 - 52:37)
in because that's like their big mascot (52:35 - 52:39)
yeah (52:37 - 52:41)
but I do think the bigger sadness is we (52:39 - 52:44)
are saying goodbye to Team Rocket yeah (52:41 - 52:45)
okay yeah there's there's so much here (52:44 - 52:47)
like like (52:45 - 52:48)
okay I wanna I wanna still talk about (52:47 - 52:50)
the the the (52:48 - 52:52)
possibly daughter thing here before we (52:50 - 52:54)
get to Team Rocket and other characters (52:52 - 52:56)
uh because like the the thing that I (52:54 - 52:59)
think people Point well rather or not (52:56 - 53:03)
she has a hairpin that is the similar to (52:59 - 53:05)
his hat whether or not she had that (53:03 - 53:07)
hairpin whether or not her hair is black (53:05 - 53:10)
which is the biggest mental gymnastics (53:07 - 53:12)
in the entire world that because she has (53:10 - 53:14)
Ash has black hair she has black hair (53:12 - 53:16)
they gotta put two and two together like (53:14 - 53:18)
that's that it's a stretch (53:16 - 53:21)
I would like people to look at the (53:18 - 53:24)
average color of hair of both China and (53:21 - 53:26)
Japan (53:24 - 53:26)
so just you there's a lot of characters (53:26 - 53:30)
in the Pokemon anime that have black (53:28 - 53:33)
hair anyways uh even without the hairpin (53:30 - 53:35)
I think people would have still jumped (53:33 - 53:37)
to the I hope it's Ash's daughter here (53:35 - 53:41)
are the possible ships uh and you know (53:37 - 53:43)
Serena is up there I saw people (53:41 - 53:46)
comparing eye color between Serena and (53:43 - 53:48)
Dawn and Misty and I don't know who the (53:46 - 53:50)
other companion May if you're gonna (53:48 - 53:52)
compare eye color and eye shape though (53:50 - 53:54)
her eyes are goes eye color and eye (53:52 - 53:57)
shape I will have you just take that (53:54 - 54:00)
because the eyes change every this (53:57 - 54:02)
season because they they changed the (54:00 - 54:04)
animation every season and we talked (54:02 - 54:05)
about why they changed the animation (54:04 - 54:07)
every season they change it so when you (54:05 - 54:08)
look at it on the TV you know what (54:07 - 54:10)
generation you're in like if as soon as (54:08 - 54:12)
I see like three seconds of black and (54:10 - 54:14)
white I'm like that is black and white (54:12 - 54:16)
because we Beyblade kid is about to (54:14 - 54:19)
appear and let them rip like like you (54:16 - 54:20)
just know based off that animation (54:19 - 54:22)
series (54:20 - 54:23)
um (54:22 - 54:27)
I I I I you know the whole like I know (54:23 - 54:29)
it's an anime trope (54:27 - 54:31)
I I've seen like three episodes of (54:29 - 54:32)
Naruto (54:31 - 54:34)
um there was a lot of Naruto that (54:32 - 54:37)
happened in my household uh so I I feel (54:34 - 54:39)
like I've seen the entire thing without (54:37 - 54:41)
actually looking at it just because it (54:39 - 54:43)
was like constantly on but like at least (54:41 - 54:45)
with you know what they went from Naruto (54:43 - 54:50)
to baruto which is boruto's Naruto's son (54:45 - 54:52)
but at least to that (54:50 - 54:55)
he has an interest and you watch that (54:52 - 54:58)
interest develop and you watch them get (54:55 - 55:00)
married and so for them to have a kid (54:58 - 55:03)
like makes sense there there's there's (55:00 - 55:07)
in 25 years there's two on-screen Kisses (55:03 - 55:11)
one is to Serena two is to a Latias and (55:07 - 55:13)
I wish that uh like like I'm not even (55:11 - 55:14)
like that's not even me making it up (55:13 - 55:16)
that's literally what happened what is (55:14 - 55:20)
to us Arena yeah and bloody ass is the (55:16 - 55:22)
better choice so Ash do the right thing (55:20 - 55:26)
so to and also he had a he he for sure (55:22 - 55:28)
had on-screen hots for Melanie which was (55:26 - 55:30)
the the flute girl from Pokemon the (55:28 - 55:33)
Movie 2000. and that had the crabbies (55:30 - 55:36)
joke yeah so that's unrequited she can (55:33 - 55:37)
definitely do better than Ash yeah (55:36 - 55:39)
that's true that's true she can't she I (55:37 - 55:41)
mean she knew how to drive a speed boat (55:39 - 55:45)
that that's that's fantastic (55:41 - 55:46)
um (55:45 - 55:49)
I feel like ash having a daughter is the (55:46 - 55:52)
equivalent equivalent to JK like it can (55:49 - 55:54)
happen totally right it can totally (55:52 - 55:56)
happen that you can make it make sense (55:54 - 55:59)
the Serena Serena Fanboys out there will (55:56 - 56:02)
be overjoyed that it happened but if to (55:59 - 56:05)
me it it feels like the equivalent of JK (56:02 - 56:07)
Rowling writing like Harry Potter and (56:05 - 56:10)
Ginny had a kid and they named their she (56:07 - 56:12)
did it wasn't that part it was the it (56:10 - 56:14)
was the naming of the kid like they (56:12 - 56:17)
named their kid Albus Severus Hagrid a (56:14 - 56:20)
rowlet Dumbledore and it was like well (56:17 - 56:23)
this is the worst possible name for this (56:20 - 56:25)
kid you just needed to make sure you hit (56:23 - 56:31)
every possible like it's just so corny (56:25 - 56:33)
um I'm just gonna take a moment to point (56:31 - 56:34)
out (56:33 - 56:36)
that your parents named you literally (56:34 - 56:39)
had already existing person's name yes (56:36 - 56:44)
I I I I you know as as Greg is answering (56:39 - 56:46)
all questions about me on Twitter (56:44 - 56:52)
I I disliked my name so I changed it (56:46 - 56:54)
um people why are you asking me about (56:52 - 56:56)
Steve's last name on Twitter (56:54 - 56:59)
I was very I was very dedicated to like (56:56 - 57:01)
scrolling through your entire Twitter (56:59 - 57:05)
feed after this I would I think it is (57:01 - 57:06)
more interesting and maybe I'm in the (57:05 - 57:08)
wrong I think it's more interesting and (57:06 - 57:12)
more I think it's just better to have a (57:08 - 57:16)
character go like I saw Ash like I this (57:12 - 57:17)
is ideally this is what I want the first (57:16 - 57:19)
episode to be the first episode to be (57:17 - 57:22)
these two characters watching Ash defeat (57:19 - 57:25)
Leon and being like that is so cool and (57:22 - 57:28)
inspiring I want to be a trainer and for (57:25 - 57:30)
possibly maybe that series to end with (57:28 - 57:32)
that person uh sorry the the new (57:30 - 57:35)
characters uh they're gonna change their (57:32 - 57:37)
names liko and Roy to like somehow (57:35 - 57:40)
battle Ash and like that is the journey (57:37 - 57:42)
that's going to happen I think that's so (57:40 - 57:44)
much more interesting than just like (57:42 - 57:45)
this character walking into every town (57:44 - 57:48)
being like Oh you're Ash's daughter like (57:45 - 57:50)
I don't I don't I want that I think I (57:48 - 57:52)
think though I think the latter is more (57:50 - 57:54)
interesting I mean it depends of course (57:52 - 57:56)
it could be uh like it's also (57:54 - 58:00)
interesting of a child trying to get out (57:56 - 58:02)
of the expectations of (58:00 - 58:05)
their parents Shadow right like I I (58:02 - 58:07)
think there is also a storyline there (58:05 - 58:09)
that is interesting I just don't think (58:07 - 58:11)
again that they are going to do that and (58:09 - 58:14)
I don't think they do it well no I mean (58:11 - 58:16)
they kind of did it with Leon and hop I (58:14 - 58:18)
don't think they did it well I I think (58:16 - 58:20)
they almost did it well that and they (58:18 - 58:21)
almost did it the end of that game falls (58:20 - 58:22)
apart the beginning of that game very (58:21 - 58:26)
good uh falls apart but like that's also (58:22 - 58:28)
so fresh too of like (58:26 - 58:31)
hop struggling to fill Leon's shoes and (58:28 - 58:35)
then it not working out super well okay (58:31 - 58:35)
whatever like if it's Ash's daughter (58:36 - 58:39)
it's Ash's daughter I don't think that (58:38 - 58:40)
makes or breaks it I just think that's (58:39 - 58:43)
like a really like low-hanging fruit (58:40 - 58:45)
like you've just fallen into every (58:43 - 58:48)
single other anime Trope storyline also (58:45 - 58:50)
Greg again I'm biting off way more than (58:48 - 58:51)
I can chew (58:50 - 58:54)
in Star Wars Greg again I (58:51 - 58:57)
can chew but when they when they they (58:54 - 58:59)
did the first six right you know people (58:57 - 59:01)
love them the first three people the (58:59 - 59:03)
hated the other three when they when (59:01 - 59:05)
they did the next three with the the (59:03 - 59:06)
girl (59:05 - 59:09)
what's her name Ray Ray wasn't there (59:06 - 59:11)
like this constant debate of whether she (59:09 - 59:14)
she was fresh wasn't related to anyone (59:11 - 59:17)
or she was like Luke Skywalker like (59:14 - 59:20)
related so there was like yeah I I saw (59:17 - 59:22)
as a non-star Wars fan people being like (59:20 - 59:25)
I hope that she's related to Luke and (59:22 - 59:27)
then I the other part is like I hope (59:25 - 59:30)
that she's just fresh because we need it (59:27 - 59:32)
to be fresh I don't even know how that (59:30 - 59:37)
ended up she's related to Luke (59:32 - 59:40)
uh it ended up really complicated (59:37 - 59:45)
uh not related to Luke no but ultimately (59:40 - 59:51)
decides to be related to Luke in the end (59:45 - 59:54)
I don't know what that means yeah it's (59:51 - 59:57)
it's so here's the thing like (59:54 - 59:59)
we we tend to fall into this trap a lot (59:57 - 60:01)
where where it's like we hear people (59:59 - 60:04)
saying they want this and then they then (60:01 - 60:05)
they're saying they want this like they (60:04 - 60:08)
are very distinct different camps right (60:05 - 60:11)
like they're just trying to be really (60:08 - 60:13)
yeah it's at any given time which Camp (60:11 - 60:15)
is being allowed there were a lot of (60:13 - 60:17)
people who really really wanted Ray to (60:15 - 60:20)
be a descendant of Luke (60:17 - 60:23)
for a lot of reasons (60:20 - 60:25)
um much of it was extended Universe (60:23 - 60:27)
stuff because they really wanted their (60:25 - 60:28)
extended Universe stuff to carry through (60:27 - 60:30)
and not to have Disney nuke it from (60:28 - 60:33)
orbit and say none of this exists (60:30 - 60:35)
Disney's nuked it from orbit and said (60:33 - 60:36)
none of this exists it's (60:35 - 60:38)
fanfiction (60:36 - 60:40)
um and so then they went a completely (60:38 - 60:43)
different route with it that (60:40 - 60:48)
I liked a lot of people hated so like it (60:43 - 60:50)
it whenever you're playing with these (60:48 - 60:53)
things and you're making lineage (60:50 - 60:56)
connections it is so fraught with how (60:53 - 60:59)
it's going to split your (60:56 - 61:03)
fan base often it's best to not do it (60:59 - 61:05)
and they did it in Star Wars and it (61:03 - 61:07)
split the fan base uh which was expected (61:05 - 61:10)
because Star Wars uh they're awful Star (61:07 - 61:13)
Wars fans are bad uh and there's never (61:10 - 61:16)
going to be a way to keep them happy (61:13 - 61:16)
um so uh getting rid of Ash and Pikachu (61:17 - 61:23)
uh still asterisks there uh (61:19 - 61:25)
I I guess I hope they go the full length (61:23 - 61:28)
and they get rid of Team Rocket as well (61:25 - 61:31)
right like Team Rocket is they're (61:28 - 61:32)
they're main characters right you know (61:31 - 61:33)
they got rid of Misty they got rid of (61:32 - 61:35)
Brock they got rid of Tracy they got rid (61:33 - 61:37)
of may they got rid of dawn they got rid (61:35 - 61:39)
of whoever Team Rocket is all as as (61:37 - 61:42)
stayed constant throughout the entire (61:39 - 61:43)
thing as well (61:42 - 61:44)
um (61:43 - 61:46)
could they bring back Team Rocket (61:44 - 61:48)
million percent (61:46 - 61:50)
uh do can they bring back Team Rocket if (61:48 - 61:54)
if they they this this girl is Ash's (61:50 - 61:57)
daughter uh maybe if they give James a (61:54 - 61:59)
walker I don't know like (61:57 - 62:03)
possibly hey James is sprightly I love (61:59 - 62:05)
tea market like I think like Team Rocket (62:03 - 62:07)
has gone through really good to being (62:05 - 62:09)
annoying to like really good again like (62:07 - 62:12)
it they they go in waves but I think (62:09 - 62:15)
really in in Sun and Moon (62:12 - 62:18)
and Journeys they really Team Rocket was (62:15 - 62:20)
kind of at its best (62:18 - 62:23)
uh because they they didn't rely on Team (62:20 - 62:26)
Rocket every episode uh which was which (62:23 - 62:28)
made them even better (62:26 - 62:30)
they got kind of more of their own (62:28 - 62:32)
storyline yeah than I had in the past (62:30 - 62:35)
I'm assuming they're like like team we (62:32 - 62:37)
we didn't we never knew what Ash's goal (62:35 - 62:40)
was well Ash has never defined his goal (62:37 - 62:42)
and they decide Ash has never defined (62:40 - 62:45)
his goal but we always knew Team (62:42 - 62:47)
Rocket's goal (62:45 - 62:49)
their goal was to get Pikachu that was (62:47 - 62:52)
it that was their that was their entire (62:49 - 62:55)
goal and if there's no Pikachu to get (62:52 - 62:58)
what are they doing in the anime (62:55 - 63:00)
unless which is possible these new (62:58 - 63:03)
characters could have a Pikachu (63:00 - 63:04)
and it's like well they're going to have (63:03 - 63:06)
the starters yeah well Ash had all the (63:04 - 63:09)
starters he still had Pikachu go had all (63:06 - 63:11)
the starters and they were still (63:09 - 63:13)
dominant and like you could have more (63:11 - 63:15)
than one starter care like anyone (63:13 - 63:17)
remember the Johto series that Chikorita (63:15 - 63:20)
was out constantly that Chikorita never (63:17 - 63:22)
went back to his pokeball johto's not (63:20 - 63:24)
canon (63:22 - 63:26)
I'm pretty sure his chick read was a (63:24 - 63:28)
girl too I think if I remember correctly (63:26 - 63:29)
uh (63:28 - 63:32)
uh I I like a lot (63:29 - 63:35)
goes away (63:32 - 63:38)
uh with Ash which (63:35 - 63:42)
you know on the on the flip side (63:38 - 63:42)
exciting (63:43 - 63:46)
yeah exciting to see something new even (63:44 - 63:48)
though I like I'm happy to be wrong (63:46 - 63:52)
because like there there is the there is (63:48 - 63:55)
the the consistency of Ash of like yep (63:52 - 63:57)
just keep keep running Ash into the (63:55 - 63:59)
ground like it's fine like you're you're (63:57 - 64:00)
still getting you're still getting good (63:59 - 64:02)
viewership you're still getting people (64:00 - 64:04)
into the anime you're still getting (64:02 - 64:05)
something in the background for people (64:04 - 64:07)
who maybe older and (64:05 - 64:09)
I think the anime is still great as the (64:07 - 64:12)
30 how old am I 34. as a 34 for you all (64:09 - 64:13)
I still have a good time watching the (64:12 - 64:15)
anime (64:13 - 64:17)
um (64:15 - 64:19)
so happy to be wrong to get new (64:17 - 64:21)
characters that's that's as exciting (64:19 - 64:23)
hard to say whether or not I'm gonna (64:21 - 64:24)
like the new characters or like the (64:23 - 64:26)
direction they're going in (64:24 - 64:29)
um yeah I don't know that Team Rocket (64:26 - 64:32)
makes sense in (64:29 - 64:33)
in (64:32 - 64:38)
paldea given the fact that I think (64:33 - 64:41)
and my hope is that the team star (64:38 - 64:44)
plot line from the games is explored (64:41 - 64:46)
better and slightly deeper in the anime (64:44 - 64:49)
because there's a that is a huge anime (64:46 - 64:53)
Trope like a huge anime Trope so (64:49 - 64:56)
the idea that they could explore that (64:53 - 64:58)
more by cutting out Team Rocket cutting (64:56 - 64:59)
out (64:58 - 65:02)
Ash and all of that and ha like focus on (64:59 - 65:06)
those Dynamics is it is very in an anime (65:02 - 65:08)
right now like that is a huge thing (65:06 - 65:10)
that's happening and like the whole (65:08 - 65:13)
school thing again has resurged (65:10 - 65:16)
um so I I think like (65:13 - 65:18)
from a business decision it makes sense (65:16 - 65:20)
to retire these things and go where the (65:18 - 65:22)
new hotness is when you have a new (65:20 - 65:24)
region that also is focusing on what the (65:22 - 65:28)
new hotness and Anime is right now (65:24 - 65:28)
I think I think the last Point here is (65:29 - 65:34)
what Greg and I started off saying uh is (65:31 - 65:36)
Ash isn't going anywhere (65:34 - 65:39)
uh there's there's this show uh uh that (65:36 - 65:40)
has existed for a long time I grew up (65:39 - 65:43)
with the show it's called Yu-Gi-Oh and (65:40 - 65:47)
Yugi hasn't been the main character in a (65:43 - 65:49)
long time do you know who keeps showing (65:47 - 65:51)
up in the show and who they keep using (65:49 - 65:54)
on all the TCG cards and all the (65:51 - 65:58)
marketing things it's Yugi Pikachu uh (65:54 - 66:01)
there's there's just like (65:58 - 66:04)
I think I think they can they can also (66:01 - 66:06)
and and maybe they did look at Yu-Gi-Oh (66:04 - 66:10)
or other shows uh and they're like oh (66:06 - 66:13)
look at these huge spikes of viewership (66:10 - 66:16)
that we get when we bring back Yugi or (66:13 - 66:19)
we bring back Ash uh or like they (66:16 - 66:20)
probably saw it with Brock and Misty (66:19 - 66:23)
like I guarantee you the most watched (66:20 - 66:25)
Sun and Moon episodes were probably the (66:23 - 66:27)
two well I guess I think rocket Missy (66:25 - 66:28)
were in like four or five episodes (66:27 - 66:31)
but I'm sure they saw huge spikes when (66:28 - 66:33)
they brought back Brock and Misty and (66:31 - 66:34)
they're like oh we can just do this with (66:33 - 66:38)
Ash yeah yeah and I got interested in it (66:34 - 66:40)
again at that point yeah I don't know if (66:38 - 66:44)
they get away with that if they (66:40 - 66:46)
like I think I think they get away with (66:44 - 66:48)
it if they age Ash a couple years but I (66:46 - 66:50)
don't think if Larry and Ash (66:48 - 66:53)
I don't think that works right no it (66:50 - 66:54)
doesn't because you have like adult Ash (66:53 - 66:56)
in the anime but you're still having (66:54 - 66:58)
like 10 year old Ash and Pikachu on like (66:56 - 67:01)
your TCG cards or your your like plushes (66:58 - 67:03)
or whatever and in Masters and (67:01 - 67:05)
everywhere else no I I think they would (67:03 - 67:08)
since Ash is (67:05 - 67:11)
vaguely ageless as it is could be 10 (67:08 - 67:13)
could be 11. depends on which official (67:11 - 67:15)
website you look at like I think they (67:13 - 67:18)
they are comfortable allowing a couple (67:15 - 67:20)
of years to pass and him being (67:18 - 67:25)
somewhere between 11 and 14. (67:20 - 67:28)
and having them show up and and be (67:25 - 67:31)
advice or just be like whatever like (67:28 - 67:33)
there's no way he's gone gone yeah like (67:31 - 67:36)
they can't they can't legally not use (67:33 - 67:38)
him I mean he'll still be in Pokemon (67:36 - 67:40)
Masters that's probably one of the (67:38 - 67:43)
reasons Masters exists yes (67:40 - 67:46)
but I will say (67:43 - 67:48)
I I mean we have a range of Ages on this (67:46 - 67:50)
show at this point in time and Greg you (67:48 - 67:51)
are well into your 20s by the time the (67:50 - 67:55)
anime started I was in first grade when (67:51 - 67:57)
I was watching this show (67:55 - 68:00)
and it's going to be sad to see all of (67:57 - 68:01)
these characters go away I am one of (68:00 - 68:04)
those people who is is maybe not (68:01 - 68:06)
entirely surprised because this has been (68:04 - 68:11)
a good end to the story they have done (68:06 - 68:13)
it really well redirecting the anime (68:11 - 68:16)
towards this big competition that Ash (68:13 - 68:17)
could win (68:16 - 68:20)
but it's gonna be sad I remember back at (68:17 - 68:22)
the end of the original series before (68:20 - 68:25)
Cohen started there was that episode (68:22 - 68:27)
where Ash and Misty and Brock all went (68:25 - 68:30)
their visibly separate ways and that is (68:27 - 68:33)
a core memory for me because I think (68:30 - 68:35)
that was the first time I cried as a kid (68:33 - 68:38)
at something being sad in a show (68:35 - 68:41)
mine (68:38 - 68:41)
that doesn't count (68:42 - 68:46)
I think that's gonna happen here I think (68:44 - 68:47)
that's gonna happen here for a lot of (68:46 - 68:49)
people I know some people cried at the (68:47 - 68:52)
news I I teared up at Sarah's little (68:49 - 68:56)
video of saying goodbye to the character (68:52 - 69:00)
soon regardless this is sad but it's (68:56 - 69:01)
also (69:00 - 69:05)
it's it's exciting yeah it is also like (69:01 - 69:07)
if you look at the generational thing (69:05 - 69:11)
like this is a good time to reset for a (69:07 - 69:13)
new generation that's about that age (69:11 - 69:16)
their parents are (69:13 - 69:19)
about you know if they started watching (69:16 - 69:22)
their attend they are probably around 35 (69:19 - 69:26)
now Steve and in theory they may have (69:22 - 69:29)
they may have 10 year old children and (69:26 - 69:31)
they can start a whole new fresh Journey (69:29 - 69:34)
with them right like this can be their (69:31 - 69:39)
anime and you know it it serves multiple (69:34 - 69:42)
purposes like it makes sense why they're (69:39 - 69:44)
doing it well and and I wonder if they (69:42 - 69:46)
started this around the 20th anniversary (69:44 - 69:49)
and and I think I I don't know if people (69:46 - 69:51)
remember the 20th anniversary I do that (69:49 - 69:54)
was the first time they got a Super Bowl (69:51 - 69:57)
ad and that Super Bowl ad always stuck (69:54 - 69:59)
with me because it literally showed (69:57 - 70:01)
a parent (69:59 - 70:03)
showing their kid Pokemon for the first (70:01 - 70:06)
time but showing them as like I was your (70:03 - 70:08)
age when I got into this (70:06 - 70:11)
and I still love it and now you can get (70:08 - 70:13)
into it too (70:11 - 70:15)
and that's that to me has kind of been (70:13 - 70:18)
the theme for the last five years is (70:15 - 70:21)
like Pokemon has has not verbally (70:18 - 70:24)
acknowledged this but through media (70:21 - 70:26)
through merchandise through what they (70:24 - 70:28)
have been doing they have a they have (70:26 - 70:30)
acknowledged my fan made weird noise (70:28 - 70:33)
they haven't acknowledged that like we (70:30 - 70:36)
have all of these adults that now have (70:33 - 70:37)
money (70:36 - 70:40)
and we can sell them 500 watches we can (70:37 - 70:41)
sell them a hundred dollar metal (70:40 - 70:44)
pokeballs we can make these kinds of (70:41 - 70:47)
things for adults that have money and (70:44 - 70:49)
these adults now have kids (70:47 - 70:53)
and we can we can do a complete circle (70:49 - 70:55)
of we're getting new 10 years olds in (70:53 - 70:58)
adults are coming back to our thing and (70:55 - 71:01)
we can now do the whole Disney thing of (70:58 - 71:05)
we're we're we're for everyone (71:01 - 71:07)
and we don't have to just focus on kids (71:05 - 71:11)
because those kids are now adults and uh (71:07 - 71:12)
they they need to put their money into (71:11 - 71:15)
some sort of Hobby and here's a brand (71:12 - 71:19)
new 300 sterling silver Rayquaza pen you (71:15 - 71:21)
can buy oh it sold out in 10 minutes (71:19 - 71:23)
yeah of course it did because you guys (71:21 - 71:26)
have money well it's the Disney thing (71:23 - 71:28)
like like they understood that they are (71:26 - 71:30)
generational brand yeah I said it on the (71:28 - 71:33)
show before but like this is this is the (71:30 - 71:36)
clearest sign of we are now a (71:33 - 71:39)
generational company and we are going to (71:36 - 71:42)
act like a generational company (71:39 - 71:43)
um it's the reason why Disney does live (71:42 - 71:45)
remakes because they have to up the IP (71:43 - 71:46)
every 10 years (71:45 - 71:49)
um or they lose copyright like they're (71:46 - 71:51)
gonna ask is coming back because you're (71:49 - 71:52)
gonna have copyright issues if you don't (71:51 - 71:54)
oh yeah I wouldn't be surprised if if (71:52 - 71:59)
movies are still Ash focused uh yeah (71:54 - 72:01)
yeah movies will be Ash focused I mean (71:59 - 72:03)
they already rebooted the movies right (72:01 - 72:06)
like they rebooted Ash they had one good (72:03 - 72:08)
one and one bad one so (72:06 - 72:10)
hahaha (72:08 - 72:12)
oh well I think they're two good ones (72:10 - 72:14)
because this I forgot about the jungle (72:12 - 72:16)
one that was the first time you've said (72:14 - 72:18)
the zarude or the ICC has been good (72:16 - 72:21)
I like that you just you and Micah (72:18 - 72:22)
decided I didn't like I choose you (72:21 - 72:25)
because of one moment I found laughable (72:22 - 72:28)
was it the Pikachu yeah the Pikachu (72:25 - 72:29)
speaking and I explained like the weird (72:28 - 72:33)
flashback the black and white flashback (72:29 - 72:33)
do you remember that part that actually (72:34 - 72:37)
was my least favorite part of the movie (72:35 - 72:39)
where they did that weird black and (72:37 - 72:41)
white flashback of like ash in the (72:39 - 72:42)
school (72:41 - 72:44)
oh no I didn't hate that no yeah I (72:42 - 72:46)
didn't like that part and I didn't I (72:44 - 72:48)
didn't care like there's a lot of that (72:46 - 72:51)
movie that was very fluffy but uh I mean (72:48 - 72:53)
overall very Trope heavy as well yeah (72:51 - 72:55)
that movie is just dredging through the (72:53 - 72:57)
tropes (72:55 - 73:00)
um but no I think I liked I choose you (72:57 - 73:02)
like I was like I would watch that again (73:00 - 73:04)
it's not my favorite but I liked it (73:02 - 73:06)
um you could not pay me enough money to (73:04 - 73:09)
watch the Power of us again (73:06 - 73:11)
I want to remind (73:09 - 73:14)
people that I I went I went to that (73:11 - 73:17)
movie with with uh with other people who (73:14 - 73:21)
then fell asleep during that movie (73:17 - 73:23)
I don't think it exists on it's not on (73:21 - 73:25)
Amazon anymore I checked the other day (73:23 - 73:28)
yeah not Amazon Netflix wow it's not on (73:25 - 73:30)
Netflix anymore (73:28 - 73:32)
yeah it's not easy to watch that movie (73:30 - 73:35)
anymore at all (73:32 - 73:37)
um all right uh we just got Pokemon Go (73:35 - 73:39)
News to to cover here we got two two (73:37 - 73:42)
things uh (73:39 - 73:44)
uh uh Hannah can I put this on your (73:42 - 73:45)
shoulders can you can you tell us about (73:44 - 73:47)
the scatter bug stuff (73:45 - 73:49)
are you looking for me to read it (73:47 - 73:51)
because I don't have that page up but I (73:49 - 73:52)
can (73:51 - 73:55)
I I haven't done the scatterbox stuff (73:52 - 73:58)
but I feel like you probably did do a (73:55 - 74:00)
little bit of it oh yeah (73:58 - 74:03)
um I I'm gonna point out just for (74:00 - 74:04)
everybody (74:03 - 74:07)
who makes fun of me in the Pokemon go (74:04 - 74:10)
press release they say video (74:07 - 74:12)
it's right there they spell it out it's (74:10 - 74:17)
always been Vivion it's French yeah (74:12 - 74:21)
people are like it's vavilion (74:17 - 74:21)
the only oh yep the only reason I've (74:21 - 74:26)
known that this entire time is because (74:24 - 74:29)
of Nintendogs having the Papillon dog in (74:26 - 74:31)
there (74:29 - 74:31)
and I knew that that meant butterfly in (74:35 - 74:39)
French because that dog's ears look like (74:37 - 74:41)
a butterfly (74:39 - 74:41)
they in Pokemon go have Vivion now along (74:42 - 74:49)
with Scatterbug and spupa in the press (74:46 - 74:51)
release they say that you can collect (74:49 - 74:53)
scatterbug's whole evolutionary line (74:51 - 74:55)
which is true if you're not counting all (74:53 - 74:58)
of the forms because they have 18 of 20 (74:55 - 75:00)
forms available in Pokemon go (74:58 - 75:02)
um one of the other forms that is not (75:00 - 75:05)
available in go is available in paldea (75:02 - 75:07)
and the other one the Pokeball form is (75:05 - 75:09)
simply not available yet that's probably (75:07 - 75:11)
going to be an event in the future I'm (75:09 - 75:13)
looking forward to it because that's my (75:11 - 75:14)
favorite form (75:13 - 75:16)
oh but (75:14 - 75:19)
huh I don't know you say everybody likes (75:16 - 75:21)
it I'm not a huge fan (75:19 - 75:24)
win somebody who's explaining to you (75:21 - 75:25)
because I'm like what is this and they (75:24 - 75:27)
said I'm like I'm out it's just more (75:25 - 75:30)
work to do on the friends list (75:27 - 75:32)
um awful it has brought people together (75:30 - 75:36)
it has got people uh making new friends (75:32 - 75:39)
online it's gotten people to start (75:36 - 75:41)
sending gifts to their lucky friends (75:39 - 75:42)
than their best friends again and (75:41 - 75:45)
opening lucky friend gifts which (75:42 - 75:47)
the way I feel about that is it's more (75:45 - 75:50)
work to do in the friends list (75:47 - 75:53)
um and it took me it took me two days to (75:50 - 75:56)
figure out that I could pin and unpin a (75:53 - 75:57)
uh (75:56 - 76:00)
postcard on the same screen and that I (75:57 - 76:02)
didn't have to pin it there close it out (76:00 - 76:04)
go catch the Pokemon and then go all the (76:02 - 76:06)
way to the postcard book and unpin it (76:04 - 76:08)
there (76:06 - 76:09)
uh the postman Brook is also limited I (76:08 - 76:13)
think to like 100 yes 300. oh 300 300. (76:09 - 76:15)
there have been some (76:13 - 76:18)
uh State among speculation things that (76:15 - 76:21)
it there will be an upgrade for it that (76:18 - 76:25)
will cost money but that is not out yet (76:21 - 76:27)
you know Niantic is really struggling to (76:25 - 76:28)
pay the bills here so (76:27 - 76:31)
and there are 18 of these forms and the (76:28 - 76:35)
one for the west side of the United (76:31 - 76:40)
States is all the high plains pattern (76:35 - 76:42)
and I am in the Pacific Northwest where (76:40 - 76:45)
it rains constantly and the description (76:42 - 76:47)
for the high plains pattern in the (76:45 - 76:50)
paldea Pokedex is from lands with little (76:47 - 76:54)
rain and I found that hilarious I don't (76:50 - 76:55)
even know what we are we're polar Greg (76:54 - 76:58)
are we polar so this this lines up (76:55 - 77:00)
pretty much with the 3DS which in the (76:58 - 77:04)
3DS we would have been polar as as well (77:00 - 77:06)
um also if if prior to this coming out (77:04 - 77:09)
if you were ever a 3DS player or a (77:06 - 77:10)
Pokemon home (77:09 - 77:14)
subscriber first off sorry uh but if you (77:10 - 77:16)
if you were trying to collect and trade (77:14 - 77:21)
Vivion uh elegant was very dominant on (77:16 - 77:23)
on the wonder trade slash Pokemon home (77:21 - 77:27)
it and it's because Japanese players (77:23 - 77:28)
love (77:27 - 77:31)
this they do uh which is they do right (77:28 - 77:33)
so you see a lot of Elegance going (77:31 - 77:35)
around (77:33 - 77:37)
um and then of course just I'm assuming (77:35 - 77:39)
it's going to be the same for Pokemon go (77:37 - 77:41)
compared to the 3DS the the ones in (77:39 - 77:44)
Africa always seem to be the harder ones (77:41 - 77:45)
to get (77:44 - 77:48)
uh on the plus side you can maybe argue (77:45 - 77:50)
the South American ones would be hard (77:48 - 77:52)
but Pokemon go is so big in South (77:50 - 77:54)
America it's actually insane how big it (77:52 - 77:56)
is and like the fact that I think (77:54 - 77:58)
niantics only had like one event (77:56 - 78:00)
or maybe zero events in South America is (77:58 - 78:03)
actually a crime because of again how (78:00 - 78:06)
big specifically in Brazil Pokemon go is (78:03 - 78:08)
they've definitely had events they've (78:06 - 78:10)
just been smaller yeah (78:08 - 78:11)
um (78:10 - 78:14)
rip to Australia who I don't think has (78:11 - 78:15)
had an event at all (78:14 - 78:17)
still yet (78:15 - 78:21)
uh so I I have I've only seen tons of (78:17 - 78:23)
people really like this feature (78:21 - 78:26)
um although I understand the work that (78:23 - 78:27)
you have to do with the pinning and (78:26 - 78:28)
stuff they did I mean they started the (78:27 - 78:30)
animations which which I think they (78:28 - 78:32)
probably if they didn't do that prior to (78:30 - 78:34)
this you probably would have seen yeah (78:32 - 78:37)
more complaints and I mean this is a new (78:34 - 78:39)
Pokemon this is a new Pokemon and an (78:37 - 78:41)
exciting way to release it that hasn't (78:39 - 78:45)
gone wrong yeah so I I my speculation I (78:41 - 78:47)
don't know this I know I'm in the (78:45 - 78:49)
Niantic Creator group they don't (78:47 - 78:51)
sometimes they tell us stuff sometimes (78:49 - 78:53)
they don't my speculation is the people (78:51 - 78:55)
who worked on the Mega Evolution moved (78:53 - 78:59)
on to this project and that's why one so (78:55 - 79:02)
far it's it's mostly positive two it's (78:59 - 79:04)
not broken (79:02 - 79:04)
the alternative or I guess maybe the (79:06 - 79:12)
worry was that Vivion was going to spawn (79:08 - 79:14)
regionally specific and in order to get (79:12 - 79:16)
them all you would have to travel and (79:14 - 79:18)
find somebody in South Africa to trade (79:16 - 79:21)
with in North Africa and West Africa (79:18 - 79:24)
um but this lets you get them all (79:21 - 79:27)
from the comfort of your couch uh but (79:24 - 79:29)
you do still have to be social you still (79:27 - 79:31)
do have to try to find friends and but (79:29 - 79:34)
much easier than buying a plane ticket (79:31 - 79:38)
and going to Africa or New Zealand or (79:34 - 79:41)
Japan to do that (79:38 - 79:44)
so I I do think (79:41 - 79:46)
you know I remember when they announced (79:44 - 79:48)
Mew Shiny Mew and people were like I'm (79:46 - 79:50)
never gonna get shiny Mew because I'm (79:48 - 79:51)
not 40 and it's like well the best way (79:50 - 79:53)
to level up is friends and they would be (79:51 - 79:55)
like well I don't have any friends (79:53 - 79:59)
and Niantic is trying to solve that (79:55 - 80:00)
problem right of like you should try to (79:59 - 80:03)
get friends because not only does is a (80:00 - 80:06)
great way to help you level up uh it's (80:03 - 80:08)
now you can get (80:06 - 80:11)
Vivion or it's also you know I've said (80:08 - 80:13)
this before it's also a great way to get (80:11 - 80:15)
items right like if if you don't if you (80:13 - 80:17)
live in a city with one pokestop and one (80:15 - 80:18)
gym (80:17 - 80:20)
and you open your 20 gifts it does give (80:18 - 80:22)
you a lot of pokeballs a lot of berries (80:20 - 80:26)
a lot of stuff it does it does refresh (80:22 - 80:28)
your item back that being said if you (80:26 - 80:30)
don't have 20 friends to open 20 gifts a (80:28 - 80:32)
day you're stuck again right like (80:30 - 80:34)
there's only (80:32 - 80:38)
so much the game can do at a certain (80:34 - 80:40)
point it's kind of like okay (80:38 - 80:42)
here are all your tools you kind of have (80:40 - 80:45)
to use your tools but again I do think (80:42 - 80:49)
this is a great way to encourage friends (80:45 - 80:52)
uh get people to open gifts because I (80:49 - 80:54)
I'm in the same boat (80:52 - 80:57)
as as YouTube where it's like I have to (80:54 - 80:59)
go open 20 gifts or I gotta send gifts (80:57 - 81:02)
and it's like I don't need the items (80:59 - 81:05)
um I don't I now I'm at the point I need (81:02 - 81:07)
the experience because I just let hit 48 (81:05 - 81:10)
and I was like Beauty 25 million to get (81:07 - 81:11)
to friends now okay I gotta open more (81:10 - 81:14)
gifts they made it faster so that's all (81:11 - 81:16)
before this update they made the whole (81:14 - 81:18)
like game faster so that's really great (81:16 - 81:20)
but now on top of that you can get (81:18 - 81:21)
a Pokemon (81:20 - 81:24)
so they they have been doing it (81:21 - 81:27)
better I'm not sure what (81:24 - 81:29)
I mean I I understand the issue of like (81:27 - 81:30)
I have to go to my gifts and fumble (81:29 - 81:31)
through that I don't know how they make (81:30 - 81:32)
that better (81:31 - 81:35)
I don't think there is a way to (81:32 - 81:37)
I just want to say that I went through (81:35 - 81:40)
the pain of getting all of these forms (81:37 - 81:44)
in home yes for a sticker and a (81:40 - 81:46)
background and then you go players come (81:44 - 81:50)
along with your easy forms devaluing my (81:46 - 81:53)
hard work I don't know if they're easy I (81:50 - 81:56)
don't know if I'd call them easy uh yeah (81:53 - 81:58)
I I did collect all the vivions and (81:56 - 82:00)
Vivion I did call them all in uh home (81:58 - 82:03)
and that was fun it was uh it was a (82:00 - 82:06)
hassle as well yeah I'm just here's the (82:03 - 82:08)
thing I'm not doing it again I did it (82:06 - 82:09)
once kids I actually technically did it (82:08 - 82:10)
twice because there was a bunch that (82:09 - 82:12)
like what here's the thing there was a (82:10 - 82:15)
bunch that was in my bank in my 3DS and (82:12 - 82:17)
I thought (82:15 - 82:19)
I don't I don't want to do that transfer (82:17 - 82:21)
I don't want to find them all I'm just (82:19 - 82:24)
going to search for them at home (82:21 - 82:24)
but I don't add people to my friends (82:25 - 82:30)
list who aren't in communities I'm in I (82:27 - 82:31)
don't add people that I don't either (82:30 - 82:34)
know in person or will maybe someday (82:31 - 82:36)
meet in person and so I might just have (82:34 - 82:37)
to sort of (82:36 - 82:40)
hope that people I know travel to fun (82:37 - 82:42)
places because (82:40 - 82:44)
um I don't really I don't like adding (82:42 - 82:47)
people that I don't know I like being (82:44 - 82:48)
able to say oh I have you from my (82:47 - 82:50)
friends list I've been exchanging gifts (82:48 - 82:52)
with you for years and we finally get to (82:50 - 82:56)
meet that's exciting but doing that with (82:52 - 82:58)
someone that I am almost definitely (82:56 - 82:59)
never gonna meet that's in a whole (82:58 - 83:01)
different Community that's just somebody (82:59 - 83:03)
I've found in a Twitter thread (83:01 - 83:03)
um (83:03 - 83:05)
that is someone I am unlikely to ever (83:03 - 83:08)
see again that is someone that I don't (83:05 - 83:09)
think I'm going to be building Community (83:08 - 83:12)
with in the same way I could be wrong (83:09 - 83:14)
um I could be wrong oh Pokemon go has (83:12 - 83:17)
led to Amazing Friends in amazing places (83:14 - 83:20)
I have I am still friends with somebody (83:17 - 83:22)
that I did a random Giratina raid in (83:20 - 83:24)
2018 in New York with (83:22 - 83:28)
um and sometimes Pokemon go friends can (83:24 - 83:29)
happen in that direction where you add (83:28 - 83:32)
someone via code online and eventually (83:29 - 83:34)
you meet them even though you haven't (83:32 - 83:36)
talked elsewhere (83:34 - 83:39)
but I think that that is much rarer (83:36 - 83:41)
and so I yeah I expect this to be a very (83:39 - 83:43)
slow process for me getting all of the (83:41 - 83:46)
Vivion yeah I I I I I don't think this (83:43 - 83:49)
is a fast process well I don't know (83:46 - 83:52)
people speeding through it I'm able to (83:49 - 83:54)
speed through it a lot I have seen uh (83:52 - 83:56)
well here the the other thing to think (83:54 - 83:58)
about too is I remember when they not (83:56 - 84:00)
the mega reboot but when they when they (83:58 - 84:03)
first launched megas there was this huge (84:00 - 84:06)
uh pushback of like this is very money (84:03 - 84:09)
grabby I don't want to do these raids I (84:06 - 84:11)
want to collect megas but I don't want (84:09 - 84:13)
to participate in the system you've (84:11 - 84:16)
created and in this system and then they (84:13 - 84:18)
rebooted megas and everyone loved it and (84:16 - 84:20)
this system there's none of that the the (84:18 - 84:22)
pushback is like ah it's tedious and (84:20 - 84:25)
it's like well you've just you've that (84:22 - 84:28)
that is all the Pokemon Go the whole (84:25 - 84:31)
game is tedious but you know there's no (84:28 - 84:33)
cost right you literally just have to (84:31 - 84:35)
make friends open gifts keep track of (84:33 - 84:37)
what you're collecting so for a person (84:35 - 84:39)
who might (84:37 - 84:43)
need some sort of goal or a person that (84:39 - 84:44)
look I don't they don't care about (84:43 - 84:45)
rating they don't care about leveling up (84:44 - 84:48)
Pokemon they don't care about battling (84:45 - 84:50)
this is a great feature like there are (84:48 - 84:51)
some people out there that only log into (84:50 - 84:53)
Pokemon go (84:51 - 84:55)
they want to complete their Pokedex they (84:53 - 84:57)
caught the furfrew that they caught the (84:55 - 84:59)
whatever new Pokemon and they come back (84:57 - 85:00)
in two weeks or three weeks or whatever (84:59 - 85:05)
right like they've they I (85:00 - 85:08)
think we brag on Niantic a lot which is (85:05 - 85:10)
very well deserved they make a lot of (85:08 - 85:12)
bad decisions but in this case (85:10 - 85:15)
they've released something brand new a (85:12 - 85:17)
new feature a new thing to keep track of (85:15 - 85:19)
something in the game that you can do or (85:17 - 85:20)
you can just ignore it right like the (85:19 - 85:22)
same thing with stickers some people out (85:20 - 85:26)
there really like stickers uh but I'm so (85:22 - 85:29)
glad they never did the like well you'd (85:26 - 85:31)
have to use the stickers to like they (85:29 - 85:33)
didn't yeah you can use them if you want (85:31 - 85:35)
you can ignore them there's no like (85:33 - 85:37)
weird punishment for avoiding that (85:35 - 85:40)
feature uh yeah yeah they're (85:37 - 85:42)
occasionally field researches yeah but (85:40 - 85:44)
again it's it's it's not like they're (85:42 - 85:47)
it's not like I I'll give me 30 put (85:44 - 85:50)
stickers on gifts instead of like battle (85:47 - 85:51)
five Team Rocket because I don't want to (85:50 - 85:53)
battle any more Team Rocket uh they're (85:51 - 85:55)
still in the game can they retire when (85:53 - 85:58)
Ash retired we can only hope bring me (85:55 - 86:01)
the Team Plasma yeah there is there is (85:58 - 86:03)
that interesting thing with the uh La (86:01 - 86:06)
event where you're citing with Team (86:03 - 86:09)
Rocket against who knows who (86:06 - 86:12)
so that might be an evolution to what (86:09 - 86:15)
team rocket is Oh you mean the the was (86:12 - 86:20)
La not La sorry uh the other two letter (86:15 - 86:24)
uh Los Angeles Las Vegas (86:20 - 86:24)
Yes Las Vegas yeah the Vegas event next (86:24 - 86:30)
year in February that you are siding (86:28 - 86:33)
with team go rocket against who knows (86:30 - 86:35)
who in that storyline (86:33 - 86:40)
and maybe that'll be the new evil teams (86:35 - 86:42)
from other games coming along maybe (86:40 - 86:45)
it'll be Team Magma Team Aqua from Hoenn (86:42 - 86:48)
because it'll be the Hoenn tour but (86:45 - 86:51)
we have yet to find out (86:48 - 86:51)
uh final business news now we can write (86:51 - 86:56)
on Niantic there we we praise Niantic (86:53 - 87:01)
for a a very good new system new Pokemon (86:56 - 87:02)
collect your battles go get your (87:01 - 87:06)
butterflies now we can say Niantic (87:02 - 87:09)
messed up uh they released a winter (87:06 - 87:10)
research (87:09 - 87:13)
uh so we got a brand new Pokemon Mega (87:10 - 87:15)
Glalie debuts although I don't think a (87:13 - 87:16)
single person in the world likes Mega (87:15 - 87:19)
Glalie it's weird some people do (87:16 - 87:22)
that's like this weird disconnected (87:19 - 87:25)
lower jaw going on it's very jarring I (87:22 - 87:27)
don't like it (87:25 - 87:30)
um this is part one of a two-part (87:27 - 87:33)
Festival which they've done before they (87:30 - 87:34)
did this for Halloween too Halloween was (87:33 - 87:36)
two parts (87:34 - 87:40)
um you're gonna get 50 percent more (87:36 - 87:43)
uh uh XP for winning rights you're gonna (87:40 - 87:45)
get you can store up to 40 gifts which (87:43 - 87:48)
okay let's be fair that's great for this (87:45 - 87:50)
Vivion event (87:48 - 87:52)
um but they're introducing a five dollar (87:50 - 87:55)
paid research (87:52 - 87:57)
um there is now now (87:55 - 88:01)
we talked about two weeks ago the caldeo (87:57 - 88:04)
proposed in this one eight dollars and (88:01 - 88:06)
that was you get a Keldeo this five (88:04 - 88:09)
dollars you only get a pose which uh not (88:06 - 88:11)
to defend poses are five dollars (88:09 - 88:14)
normally but I think this is still bad (88:11 - 88:17)
and I will say this is bad while Niantic (88:14 - 88:18)
did provide me a free five dollar ticket (88:17 - 88:21)
I will still say it's bad (88:18 - 88:21)
um (88:21 - 88:24)
suppose them crushing this package out (88:21 - 88:26)
to their the poses them throwing the (88:24 - 88:27)
package like behind their shoulder and (88:26 - 88:29)
catching it yeah but they crush it (88:27 - 88:30)
against their chest no they're holding (88:29 - 88:33)
it to their hearts Greg (88:30 - 88:36)
they're thinking of the power of us (88:33 - 88:38)
and there is the fact that while caldia (88:36 - 88:41)
will come back the pose might not yeah (88:38 - 88:43)
uh I don't think the Mr mime pose ever (88:41 - 88:46)
came back right yeah I don't think that (88:43 - 88:48)
one's available anymore so for five (88:46 - 88:50)
dollars Greg let me see like for five (88:48 - 88:52)
dollars I get it posted on the I see and (88:50 - 88:54)
will sometimes show up in raids if (88:52 - 88:58)
The Raid picture actually works instead (88:54 - 88:59)
of often what happens which is a bunch (88:58 - 89:01)
of blank things with names sorry at the (88:59 - 89:03)
top also shows us up and go battle (89:01 - 89:05)
League you can let the other people (89:03 - 89:07)
you're about to crush know that you're (89:05 - 89:09)
crushing this present against your chest (89:07 - 89:11)
think about it think about it think (89:09 - 89:13)
about the thing you're sending to your (89:11 - 89:14)
opponent think about how many more (89:13 - 89:17)
matches you can win with the mental game (89:14 - 89:20)
of I'm crushing this present against my (89:17 - 89:22)
chest now I'm gonna Crush you with my (89:20 - 89:25)
Roselia think about that now think about (89:22 - 89:28)
for five dollars Greg you can get not (89:25 - 89:32)
one but two incubators one exactly one (89:28 - 89:35)
incense extra Obama Snow Mega Energy not (89:32 - 89:38)
Mega Glalie energy which just debuted (89:35 - 89:40)
Mega now think about the mega Obama Snow (89:38 - 89:43)
energy and then you can also get various (89:40 - 89:45)
event themed Pokemon encounters (89:43 - 89:49)
oh okay so two things just happened if (89:45 - 89:51)
you were watching YouTube One my soul (89:49 - 89:53)
left my body and Steve is officially (89:51 - 89:55)
sold out and you can write sell out (89:53 - 89:58)
Steve in the comments sell out Steve (89:55 - 90:02)
just all the way down just listen out (89:58 - 90:04)
what's there I'm just I'm just reading (90:02 - 90:08)
the website Greg sell out ah trainer (90:04 - 90:12)
she can also gift your friends a ticket (90:08 - 90:15)
uh so the the winter holiday research is (90:12 - 90:16)
available in the shop from December 15th (90:15 - 90:20)
through December 30th uh the following (90:16 - 90:23)
Pokemon will appear more frequently in (90:20 - 90:25)
the wild uh Pikachu wearing a carnival (90:23 - 90:28)
outfit swine up Deli blue Pikachu or is (90:25 - 90:30)
this the same old Pikachu (90:28 - 90:32)

new Pikachu or give me nothing (90:32 - 90:38)
over vanillite Cub chew bergmite (90:35 - 90:41)
bergmite can be shiny for the first time (90:38 - 90:43)
um (90:41 - 90:45)
kobalian is back (90:43 - 90:48)
uh it's it look it's it's not a great (90:45 - 90:51)
five dollars spent yeah this this five (90:48 - 90:53)
dollar ticket was disappointing and I (90:51 - 90:55)
think it was a mistake (90:53 - 90:57)
releasing it so soon after the Keldeo (90:55 - 90:58)
event (90:57 - 91:02)
that I'm frustrated I'm extremely (90:58 - 91:04)
frustrated I don't I don't get that (91:02 - 91:07)
frustrated that often with this game I I (91:04 - 91:09)
want I think that this is a better deal (91:07 - 91:11)
than the Keldeo event actually I think (91:09 - 91:13)
that the pose because I don't think it's (91:11 - 91:15)
going to come back is a better deal than (91:13 - 91:17)
the caldeo that is even though I I got a (91:15 - 91:20)
Hondo out of my Keldeo ticket ultimately (91:17 - 91:21)
um (91:20 - 91:23)
but this (91:21 - 91:27)
releasing this so so quickly after the (91:23 - 91:29)
Eight dollar ticket I think that that (91:27 - 91:31)
was a mistake that is making a lot of (91:29 - 91:32)
people angry I think that I'm glad the (91:31 - 91:35)
Vivion stuff came out because having a (91:32 - 91:36)
butterfly to catch is making people (91:35 - 91:38)
forget how angry they are (91:36 - 91:41)
um yeah but when this is done twice a (91:38 - 91:43)
year or once a year or maybe even once a (91:41 - 91:44)
quarter (91:43 - 91:47)
I would like twice a year (91:44 - 91:47)
um (91:47 - 91:50)
that's probably fine but there's nothing (91:47 - 91:52)
else to do in this game right now if you (91:50 - 91:55)
like having tasks to do and so having (91:52 - 91:56)
just these one after another tickets (91:55 - 91:59)
that you have to pay for if you want to (91:56 - 92:02)
have research to do (91:59 - 92:05)
just as frustrating (92:02 - 92:08)
I'm angry at Niantic about it I we we (92:05 - 92:10)
just went through this amazing season (92:08 - 92:13)
amazing debatable of alola where they've (92:10 - 92:16)
had a good solid storyline throughout (92:13 - 92:18)
that entire season that you could follow (92:16 - 92:21)
there was stuff to do granted last (92:18 - 92:23)
winter they did kind of put a hold on (92:21 - 92:24)
the storyline but they at least gave an (92:23 - 92:27)
in-game reason for putting a hold on the (92:24 - 92:29)
storyline right now there is just simply (92:27 - 92:31)
nothing there (92:29 - 92:34)
there is no explanation on the website (92:31 - 92:36)
there is no explanation in game you just (92:34 - 92:39)
have to pay to do anything (92:36 - 92:43)
in terms of research i i a million (92:39 - 92:44)
percent agree that's why I started off (92:43 - 92:46)
saying this five dollars is not working (92:44 - 92:48)
as somebody who got the five dollars for (92:46 - 92:48)
free (92:48 - 92:52)
uh I I I'd even know what I got because (92:48 - 92:53)
like you go through it and you're like (92:52 - 92:56)
oh yeah here's a mystery yeah like it (92:53 - 92:59)
like it it doesn't even it's not it's (92:56 - 93:02)
not even fun as somebody who received it (92:59 - 93:04)
for free it's not like oh I'm excited to (93:02 - 93:06)
do this right like I probably would have (93:04 - 93:08)
bought it to be fair I probably would (93:06 - 93:09)
have bought it because I do like the (93:08 - 93:09)
pose (93:09 - 93:12)
I think the pose is really great I like (93:09 - 93:13)
poses (93:12 - 93:16)
um I do a lot of raids I'm sure I I do (93:13 - 93:18)
agree with Greg half the time the raids (93:16 - 93:19)
you can't even see the poses anyways (93:18 - 93:22)
because they're broken okay it's broken (93:19 - 93:24)
um but I do like the pose and so I will (93:22 - 93:26)
I don't mind spending five dollars on a (93:24 - 93:27)
pose (93:26 - 93:30)
to me I know some people would never do (93:27 - 93:33)
that but like oh I would never do that (93:30 - 93:36)
like it's not it's just not even ex it's (93:33 - 93:40)
not even exciting it just it's so low (93:36 - 93:43)
effort here to be like here's your (93:40 - 93:46)
research I don't know again I (93:43 - 93:49)
legitimately don't know if you know what (93:46 - 93:52)
is this sixth winter seventh winter of (93:49 - 93:54)
Pokemon go I think sixth winter (93:52 - 93:57)
if Niantic sees that (93:54 - 93:58)
because they've done research before (93:57 - 94:00)
during winter that's free I wonder if (93:58 - 94:03)
Niantic sees that like oh we get such a (94:00 - 94:06)
huge drop off of players because of the (94:03 - 94:08)
holidays because people are breaking (94:06 - 94:10)
their Norms they're traveling they're (94:08 - 94:11)
not in school anymore they're not in (94:10 - 94:13)
their dorms they're at their parents in (94:11 - 94:16)
the middle of nowhere and it's cold and (94:13 - 94:17)
it's cold (94:16 - 94:21)
for him to drop off of players So This (94:17 - 94:23)
research not defending I'm just thinking (94:21 - 94:25)
as a business I wonder if this research (94:23 - 94:27)
is like (94:25 - 94:29)
we see this huge decrease of players but (94:27 - 94:31)
the players who do stick around are (94:29 - 94:33)
hardcore enough to buy the five dollars (94:31 - 94:36)
which again I think that's that that's a (94:33 - 94:38)
business I don't think that's great for (94:36 - 94:39)
your players because like Hannah said (94:38 - 94:41)
you have nothing to do but I wonder if (94:39 - 94:44)
that's like the logic here of like why (94:41 - 94:46)
they they're charging for such boring (94:44 - 94:50)
research I mean it's it is Corporate (94:46 - 94:54)
logic right right yes it is (94:50 - 94:56)
during a time when people are already (94:54 - 94:58)
feeling cash strapped because of all the (94:56 - 95:00)
expenses around the holidays let's try (94:58 - 95:02)
to get more money out of them at their (95:00 - 95:05)
free time instead of being generous like (95:02 - 95:06)
we have in the past we're going to (95:05 - 95:08)
charge you for something that's subpar (95:06 - 95:10)
shortly after we charged you something (95:08 - 95:12)
for Sharp power and just a month and a (95:10 - 95:15)
half before we make you fly and take a (95:12 - 95:17)
trip to a large expensive city to do an (95:15 - 95:18)
eh event (95:17 - 95:20)
I don't know that event seems pretty (95:18 - 95:21)
good (95:20 - 95:22)
I'm actually really excited for that one (95:21 - 95:28)
I mean I will be in Florida so I uh Greg (95:22 - 95:30)
right here right now that event will be (95:28 - 95:31)
a million percent better than anything (95:30 - 95:33)
happening in Florida the problem is (95:31 - 95:36)
you're in Florida (95:33 - 95:39)
I disagree I'm I will be I will be (95:36 - 95:41)
happily playing with the lightsaber that (95:39 - 95:43)
I built on my own so (95:41 - 95:45)
you're going to be one safe part of (95:43 - 95:48)
Florida inside Mickey's walls correct I (95:45 - 95:50)
am entirely within Mickey's walls that I (95:48 - 95:54)
shall never leave until I fly home on (95:50 - 95:56)
the 18th (95:54 - 95:58)
um we don't know what the second part (95:56 - 96:01)
looks like so usually Niantic is a bit (95:58 - 96:02)
generous during Christmas they usually (96:01 - 96:04)
give us incubators and they usually give (96:02 - 96:06)
us some other bonuses so we don't know (96:04 - 96:08)
what part two looks like but man part (96:06 - 96:10)
one kind of it's kind of it's bad it's (96:08 - 96:12)
bad it's not kind of bad it is bad is (96:10 - 96:14)
this three spirits of Christmas worthy (96:12 - 96:15)
bad (96:14 - 96:18)
I science point to yes (96:15 - 96:21)
the the event on itself is all right it (96:18 - 96:24)
is the ticket that makes it bad (96:21 - 96:25)
yeah (96:24 - 96:27)
and I don't even think switching out (96:25 - 96:29)
Obama snow for Glalie energy makes it (96:27 - 96:32)
any better for whatever reason Niantic (96:29 - 96:33)
likes to (96:32 - 96:38)
value Mega Energy and like make it seem (96:33 - 96:42)
more special than it actually is (96:38 - 96:47)
uh I like Mega Pokemon as uh as like I (96:42 - 96:49)
don't I don't need mega Pokemon to come (96:47 - 96:50)
back to the main Series games but I (96:49 - 96:52)
think it works really well in Pokemon go (96:50 - 96:53)
I think I think (96:52 - 96:56)
I think it's great Pokemon go (96:53 - 96:57)
um but like again for five dollars (96:56 - 96:59)
you're getting two incubators one (96:57 - 97:02)
incense Obama's no energy more (96:59 - 97:03)
encounters and then you're getting the (97:02 - 97:06)
pose so at the end of the day (97:03 - 97:08)
I I would only purchase this if you care (97:06 - 97:09)
about the pose (97:08 - 97:10)
because I don't think you're getting (97:09 - 97:11)
really (97:10 - 97:15)
anything more from this (97:11 - 97:17)
um I don't I don't know what makes I (97:15 - 97:19)
don't know five incubators maybe some (97:17 - 97:23)
star pieces just something more here uh (97:19 - 97:25)
and there's there's not it's just very (97:23 - 97:27)
shallow yeah and not having it right (97:25 - 97:31)
after the caldeo one yeah but uh but you (97:27 - 97:32)
think like oh if you do it right on the (97:31 - 97:34)
Kelly one you make this one better than (97:32 - 97:35)
people regret the kellyo one you should (97:34 - 97:36)
make the Kelly one better honestly but (97:35 - 97:38)
yeah but they both should have just been (97:36 - 97:40)
better both should have just had more (97:38 - 97:42)
value to them (97:40 - 97:44)
um (97:42 - 97:44)
to end on a positive note so we start (97:46 - 97:51)
off with the Vivion that was good this (97:48 - 97:54)
is bad there is a box in the store right (97:51 - 97:56)
now that's like five Super incubators (97:54 - 97:58)
and five regular incubators and it's (97:56 - 98:01)
like three dollars it's like absolutely (97:58 - 98:02)
incredible it's really really good you (98:01 - 98:04)
can only buy it once I think it's like (98:02 - 98:06)
350 technically but like a super (98:04 - 98:09)
incubator is two dollars and you get (98:06 - 98:11)
five of them and you get so I think eggs (98:09 - 98:14)
are a scam I will say that uh but that (98:11 - 98:16)
is probably the best deal Niantic has (98:14 - 98:18)
done in like two years uh it's also (98:16 - 98:19)
really nice to have that at the same (98:18 - 98:21)
time as uh this weekend that's that (98:19 - 98:24)
we're recording with the December (98:21 - 98:27)
Community Day because half uh have (98:24 - 98:30)
incubator distance is happening so if (98:27 - 98:33)
you get that deal on the incubators and (98:30 - 98:36)
put them all in there between 2 and 5 pm (98:33 - 98:37)
today which is going to be long before (98:36 - 98:40)
anyone hears this not long but before (98:37 - 98:43)
anybody hears this uh it's a very good (98:40 - 98:44)
deal (98:43 - 98:45)
yeah and that's what's crazy is like you (98:44 - 98:48)
want to spend like 350 on all of these (98:45 - 98:50)
incubators or do you want to spend five (98:48 - 98:53)
dollars on two and get like a Mr mime (98:50 - 98:54)
encounter (98:53 - 98:56)
it's a very good deal if you care about (98:54 - 98:58)
eggs I will finish my sentence there (98:56 - 99:03)
yeah uh and boxes boxes in Pogo have not (98:58 - 99:07)
been good the last year (99:03 - 99:09)
uh but you know (99:07 - 99:11)
that's Pogo in a nutshell sometimes it's (99:09 - 99:13)
good sometimes it's not (99:11 - 99:17)
you know I I I would suspect that well I (99:13 - 99:18)
think we know I think Niantic has said (99:17 - 99:20)
like summer is their like Christmas like (99:18 - 99:23)
summer is their busy season for PoGo so (99:20 - 99:29)
I'm assuming winter is is there bad (99:23 - 99:29)
um that's the show for today sorry no (99:30 - 99:34)
question of the week we ran over (99:32 - 99:35)
um (99:34 - 99:39)
uh I don't think we said this on the (99:35 - 99:42)
podcast I think I've said this on in (99:39 - 99:45)
slack or uh on Twitch but uh we will (99:42 - 99:48)
probably not be seeing will for a while (99:45 - 99:52)
uh will has taken a step back so will (99:48 - 99:55)
and I got in a huge argument about (99:52 - 99:57)
um Dark Souls you know will is a very (99:55 - 100:00)
Avid Dark Souls fan uh very dedicated to (99:57 - 100:02)
the scene no uh you know it's because (100:00 - 100:05)
you did a you did him dirty in Monster (100:02 - 100:06)
Hunter and he'll never speak to you (100:05 - 100:09)
again like this is people come to my ask (100:06 - 100:12)
me these questions I just will hate (100:09 - 100:14)
Steve not don't ask me why (100:12 - 100:16)
Steve chose his last name ask me the (100:14 - 100:18)
good things why does will hate Steve and (100:16 - 100:22)
I will DM you yeah Greg will have the (100:18 - 100:24)
Greg you know like five people are gonna (100:22 - 100:25)
take that seriously and they're gonna be (100:24 - 100:26)
fine (100:25 - 100:31)
I'm excited to break your hearts uh so (100:26 - 100:32)
no normally will takes time off because (100:31 - 100:35)
they play the game much slower than than (100:32 - 100:38)
Greg and I uh and they they want to (100:35 - 100:39)
enjoy it and they want they love like (100:38 - 100:41)
love Pokemon they want to enjoy their (100:39 - 100:43)
own pace and stuff like that uh but will (100:41 - 100:45)
wants to focus on some other stuff IRL (100:43 - 100:48)
uh they also stopped doing their own (100:45 - 100:50)
podcast earlier this year when we when (100:48 - 100:52)
will comes on the show and says like (100:50 - 100:53)
he's going to disappear into the woods (100:52 - 100:56)
one day on his bike yeah you're not (100:53 - 100:59)
kidding that's not kidding he he will (100:56 - 101:01)
probably eventually disappear from Greg (100:59 - 101:03)
and I and uh Greg and I will have to (101:01 - 101:07)
find him uh correct we have to put like (101:03 - 101:08)
an airtake in his backpack to make sure (101:07 - 101:11)
that he doesn't drive off drive into a (101:08 - 101:13)
tree in the middle of course protections (101:11 - 101:16)
against that it would let him now there (101:13 - 101:17)
are protections we'll do it we'll do the (101:16 - 101:18)
Google one that one doesn't have (101:17 - 101:22)
anything yeah look I can usually (101:18 - 101:25)
find will if I really need to all I need (101:22 - 101:29)
is a bike trail or a gym start there and (101:25 - 101:32)
the rest will fall into place (101:29 - 101:35)
uh so will has said that if if if we (101:32 - 101:37)
absolutely needed somebody he would love (101:35 - 101:40)
to jump back on uh I know that he does (101:37 - 101:42)
have thoughts about scarlet and violet (101:40 - 101:43)
So eventually when he beats that game in (101:42 - 101:45)
about six more years we will have him on (101:43 - 101:48)
for that uh I I can tell you that his (101:45 - 101:50)
favorite Pokemon so far in scarlet and (101:48 - 101:52)
violet is bramblin which I don't think (101:50 - 101:56)
anyone saw coming I don't get it I just (101:52 - 101:59)
I've avoided the conversation because I (101:56 - 102:01)
can't I can't go there I'm not a huge (101:59 - 102:03)
fan of the evolution but brambling is (102:01 - 102:05)
cute the evolution just gets a smile (102:03 - 102:07)
it's finally happy yeah the big ones (102:05 - 102:09)
this smile is kind of creepy no well (102:07 - 102:12)
it's a creepy thing rambling is tumbling (102:09 - 102:14)
away from all its haters Greg and you're (102:12 - 102:15)

said this last week let's say it again (103:50 - 103:54)
we're not missing a Monday uh even look (103:51 - 103:56)
even that Will's gone for now even if I (103:54 - 103:58)
got hit by a car which I don't know why (103:56 - 104:00)
that's always my analogy uh will will (103:58 - 104:02)
make sure the podcast comes up they are (104:00 - 104:04)
more likely to get hit by the Light Rail (104:02 - 104:07)
than a car from from the the the cabin (104:04 - 104:10)
in the middle of the force that he's now (104:07 - 104:11)
lived in he will make sure the episode (104:10 - 104:13)
goes up all right we will see you guys (104:11 - 104:15)
next week this has been another episode (104:13 - 104:19)
of the Pokemon podcast and we are (104:15 - 104:19)
we don't know how this works this ending (104:19 - 104:23)
works now you guys got to figure out (104:21 - 104:25)
this idea I I give you guys creative (104:23 - 104:29)
freedom for this ending you I mean (104:25 - 104:32)
like this is why your show notes are (104:29 - 104:34)
lackluster because you don't spell out (104:32 - 104:35)
anything you're just like I'm gonna (104:34 - 104:37)
throw some random stuff up there and (104:35 - 104:39)
then you ought to say you're super (104:37 - 104:40)
effective at the end very detailed (104:39 - 104:42)
they're very good (104:40 - 104:44)
they're giving you everything you want (104:42 - 104:47)
what do you want more you want Greg what (104:44 - 104:48)
you want what you what's gonna happen at (104:47 - 104:50)
the ending of this show (104:48 - 104:53)
again try again all right we have (104:50 - 104:55)
creative freedom here we go this has (104:53 - 104:56)
been another episode of the Pokemon (104:55 - 104:59)
podcast and we are (104:56 - 105:02)
saying goodbye to Ash Ketchum but we are (104:59 - 105:04)
still here super effective (105:02 - 105:07)
heck yeah also (105:04 - 105:09)
I read my thoughts on Twitter if you (105:07 - 105:12)
think I I'll I think the anime should (105:09 - 105:14)
end also look up Saint elsewhere because (105:12 - 105:17)
it all ties into Saint elsewhere (105:14 - 105:20)
is our actress so long (105:17 - 105:22)
because (105:20 - 105:24)
creative freedom means we're gonna (105:22 - 105:29)
Workshop in real time baby okay (105:24 - 105:29)
no we're not doing that's dead dead to (105:31 - 105:36)
me (105:34 - 105:36)
