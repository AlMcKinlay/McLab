what's up everyone welcome to the 500th (1:09 - 1:15)
episode of the pokemon podcast it's (1:12 - 1:17)
super effective uh i hate doing that (1:15 - 1:19)
live uh hello hello hello (1:17 - 1:21)
you do it live (1:19 - 1:24)
every week i don't do it i do it behind (1:21 - 1:26)
closed doors (1:24 - 1:28)
your door is closed (1:26 - 1:30)
are we no longer an interesting audience (1:28 - 1:31)
is what you're saying that we don't (1:30 - 1:34)
matter no you look as (1:31 - 1:36)
harsher than twitch ever will (1:34 - 1:39)
i have no problem (1:36 - 1:40)
you know (1:39 - 1:42)
sharing a hotel room with you guys and (1:40 - 1:45)
it's the same as opening the episode of (1:42 - 1:47)
this show but like i you know i wouldn't (1:45 - 1:49)
share the hotel room with you know some (1:47 - 1:52)
listeners that's what i'm saying a (1:49 - 1:54)
little behind the scenes (1:52 - 1:57)
it's a it's a little risque yeah (1:54 - 1:59)
please no (1:57 - 2:01)
uh i did hit the record button all right (1:59 - 2:03)
hey i'm your host uh i'm your host steve (2:01 - 2:06)
sbj i'm here this is the 500th episode (2:03 - 2:10)
greg with me today hello i dug into the (2:06 - 2:11)
archives (2:10 - 2:13)
to pull out the whap zip shirt just for (2:11 - 2:16)
the 500th episode i was gonna wear the (2:13 - 2:18)
rage candy bar shirt but like (2:16 - 2:22)
that didn't hold up hmm (2:18 - 2:24)
will also here hopefully internet (2:22 - 2:25)
connection stays stable (2:24 - 2:28)
it's oof but i i was gonna say i'm the (2:25 - 2:31)
only one here who's traditional (2:28 - 2:33)
you guys are boneless (2:31 - 2:36)
both of you yeah that's because i don't (2:33 - 2:38)
want to work when i eat my wings oh my (2:36 - 2:40)
word (2:38 - 2:40)
you're going to expose (2:41 - 2:46)
on national tv (2:44 - 2:49)
i don't think there's no tv (2:46 - 2:52)
no they were good enough for tv (2:49 - 2:52)
says you i've been on tv (2:52 - 2:57)
hey so it's uh it's been 500 episodes (2:54 - 2:59)
that's a whole lot of episodes we're (2:57 - 3:01)
here it's technically been more than 500 (2:59 - 3:02)
episodes because i'm pretty sure there's (3:01 - 3:04)
a long time that you cheated the number (3:02 - 3:07)
and then you don't count mini series (3:04 - 3:08)
yeah yeah (3:07 - 3:10)
we're probably realistically at like (3:08 - 3:12)
600. (3:10 - 3:15)
ah happy 600th episode (3:12 - 3:18)
no i think that's a little maybe over (3:15 - 3:23)
estimating but maybe like 573 (3:18 - 3:23)
that's not a good number (3:23 - 3:27)
for me (3:26 - 3:29)
so the the format of the show is if (3:27 - 3:30)
you're listening to the audio only (3:29 - 3:32)
version uh we're recording this live on (3:30 - 3:34)
twitch that'll get sent to youtube on (3:32 - 3:36)
monday so hopefully at the end of all of (3:34 - 3:39)
this the audio sounds good and it sounds (3:36 - 3:41)
like a normal episode the thing that we (3:39 - 3:43)
when we transitioned to doing video it (3:41 - 3:45)
was still very important for the audio (3:43 - 3:47)
podcast to just sound as good as it can (3:45 - 3:48)
be (3:47 - 3:49)
because i know when sometimes podcasts (3:48 - 3:51)
convert to video and then you're (3:49 - 3:52)
listening to the audio version you're (3:51 - 3:55)
like i feel like i'm missing something (3:52 - 3:57)
because it's (3:55 - 3:59)
first and foremost a video show (3:57 - 4:01)
so that's always important quality wise (3:59 - 4:03)
to make sure the audio show (4:01 - 4:05)
sounds just as good as an audio show and (4:03 - 4:07)
then once you convert to video and then (4:05 - 4:09)
when you take it another step and you (4:07 - 4:11)
convert to live as we've noticed if you (4:09 - 4:13)
missed the first maybe well it won't be (4:11 - 4:15)
in the audio podcast but there was like (4:13 - 4:18)
20 minutes of tech issues even though we (4:15 - 4:20)
started 40 minutes early to not have (4:18 - 4:22)
tech issues and we still had tech issues (4:20 - 4:25)
uh i had no tech issues and to assist (4:22 - 4:27)
our audio only listeners i will be (4:25 - 4:29)
keeping my eyes closed throughout this (4:27 - 4:30)
entire process (4:29 - 4:34)
so i won't see anything either (4:30 - 4:34)
the way we do it 500 episodes is a lot (4:34 - 4:38)
we're still going to go through pokemon (4:36 - 4:40)
news and because we're doing this live (4:38 - 4:43)
on twitch after our breaks which i guess (4:40 - 4:44)
you guys will see our breaks (4:43 - 4:46)
or we'll have breaks because we need to (4:44 - 4:48)
have breaks breaks we'll have breaks and (4:46 - 4:50)
then we'll have to do the ad so you guys (4:48 - 4:52)
will see us do the ad time that's going (4:50 - 4:54)
to be you'll get you get we'll see how (4:52 - 4:56)
much of a hot mess it is to do an ad (4:54 - 4:59)
real time and then at the end of that we (4:56 - 5:01)
will the ad is every plate and then (4:59 - 5:04)
after the end of that um we'll take like (5:01 - 5:05)
questions and stuff from twitch chat and (5:04 - 5:07)
uh so for the most part though twitch (5:05 - 5:10)
chat you will probably argue (5:07 - 5:11)
about us talking about things in real (5:10 - 5:13)
time um (5:11 - 5:15)
i am on different tabs i am no longer (5:13 - 5:16)
looking (5:15 - 5:19)
at that i'm looking oh i had to close (5:16 - 5:20)
them out otherwise they were going to (5:19 - 5:22)
kill my connection i'll be angry every (5:20 - 5:24)
week so it will be a normal episode (5:22 - 5:26)
all right (5:24 - 5:28)
500 episodes let's kick off with some (5:26 - 5:31)
pokemon news let's start off with some (5:28 - 5:33)
real (5:31 - 5:35)
let's start off this episode with a (5:33 - 5:37)
bummer i suppose (5:35 - 5:40)
this is off dot esports pokemon florida (5:37 - 5:43)
regional championships cancelled (5:40 - 5:46)
other global dates added (5:43 - 5:48)
um (5:46 - 5:49)
uh so (5:48 - 5:51)
the florida regional championships have (5:49 - 5:53)
been canceled quote due to (5:51 - 5:54)
now (5:53 - 5:56)
probably think it's oh it's because of (5:54 - 5:59)
covid well you know it's florida also uh (5:56 - 6:00)
but (5:59 - 6:02)
due to changes in worse government (6:00 - 6:05)
regulations and restricted restrictions (6:02 - 6:06)
in the state of florida this (6:05 - 6:09)
cancellation means the orange county (6:06 - 6:11)
championships which were set for april (6:09 - 6:13)
first the third also won't be happening (6:11 - 6:15)
um but there are new events being added (6:13 - 6:19)
in europe uh in bremen germany on may (6:15 - 6:22)
28th and uh may 29th and then in (6:19 - 6:25)
sao paulo brazil there will be an event (6:22 - 6:27)
on april did i say that right (6:25 - 6:29)
close enough (6:27 - 6:31)
april 2nd and 3rd (6:29 - 6:33)
and then in joinville i don't know where (6:31 - 6:35)
joinville is they don't say may 7th and (6:33 - 6:36)
8th (6:35 - 6:37)
uh australia will also have the events (6:36 - 6:39)
beginning in queensland on march 12th (6:37 - 6:40)
and 13th (6:39 - 6:42)
and uh in perth (6:40 - 6:44)
it wouldn't be 500 episodes without (6:42 - 6:45)
perth (6:44 - 6:49)
uh in perth on may 21st and may 22nd and (6:45 - 6:51)
saint kilda (6:49 - 6:53)
in victoria on june 11th and 12th so (6:51 - 6:55)
they added a bunch of your um (6:53 - 6:58)
international dates (6:55 - 7:00)
oh join join phil is also in brazil my (6:58 - 7:01)
mistake (7:00 - 7:04)
uh and then the the florida regionals (7:01 - 7:06)
got cancelled which i believe was (7:04 - 7:07)
supposed to be like april (7:06 - 7:10)
what was that april 14th 15th i think um (7:07 - 7:12)
how am i supposed to remember something (7:10 - 7:14)
i was never planning on going to so the (7:12 - 7:17)
the importance of the florida regionals (7:14 - 7:20)
was it was one of the three (7:17 - 7:22)
oh it was the april first weekend it was (7:20 - 7:24)
uh it was one of the three that had (7:22 - 7:25)
pokemon go (7:24 - 7:28)
so i believe it was oh right right salt (7:25 - 7:29)
lake city (7:28 - 7:32)
florida and then milwaukee (7:29 - 7:35)
all had the pokemon go part (7:32 - 7:36)
and then (7:35 - 7:39)
every every other regionals had the tcg (7:36 - 7:40)
and the vgc (7:39 - 7:42)
the due to cancellations in government (7:40 - 7:44)
regulation was that (7:42 - 7:46)
we can explain it (7:44 - 7:48)
um (7:46 - 7:50)
that the pokemon events require you to (7:48 - 7:54)
show proof of vaccination and florida as (7:50 - 7:56)
a state says you're not allowed to do (7:54 - 7:58)
that okay because (7:56 - 8:01)
because the event wanted proof they (7:58 - 8:03)
weren't allowed to do that therefore (8:01 - 8:05)
because pokemon wanted to be as safe as (8:03 - 8:06)
possible they had to cancel the event (8:05 - 8:08)
because florida would not let them do (8:06 - 8:09)
that (8:08 - 8:10)
because (8:09 - 8:13)
florida good job florida i mean i've (8:10 - 8:16)
i've i've had that same issue at my job (8:13 - 8:18)
so i completely i understand it can (8:16 - 8:20)
relate i wanted to do a clarification (8:18 - 8:22)
for something too that i think we (8:20 - 8:23)
brought up either last week or the week (8:22 - 8:25)
before about the abu dhabi (8:23 - 8:28)
uh pokemon go event being canceled oh (8:25 - 8:31)
yeah yeah yeah and we kind of said oh (8:28 - 8:33)
it's probably because of kobit or like (8:31 - 8:35)
implied that (8:33 - 8:36)
there is another country performing (8:35 - 8:39)
military actions against abu dhabi right (8:36 - 8:43)
now oh yeah aka missile strikes and so i (8:39 - 8:44)
think that was more of the it's not (8:43 - 8:46)
going to have people walking around (8:44 - 8:48)
outside yeah (8:46 - 8:50)
got it (8:48 - 8:52)
also florida really (8:50 - 8:55)
that's all i'm going to say that's not (8:52 - 8:58)
no surprise i'm it's not a surprise but (8:55 - 9:00)
i'm still going to be like (8:58 - 9:01)
you know the florida thing was kind of (9:00 - 9:04)
on my mind too because uh there was just (9:01 - 9:05)
that um (9:04 - 9:08)
aaron zhang like mini documentary that (9:05 - 9:10)
they put together on youtube and (9:08 - 9:12)
the if you're in like the competitive (9:10 - 9:13)
scene and you follow a lot of like the (9:12 - 9:15)
high-end competitive players like wolf (9:13 - 9:18)
click or aaron zhang um they did like a (9:15 - 9:20)
20-minute documentary on aaron zhang (9:18 - 9:23)
who's a fantastic player (9:20 - 9:24)
um but what's funny is things the (9:23 - 9:26)
documentary on themselves or somebody (9:24 - 9:28)
else's wolf (9:26 - 9:30)
wolf click and a video editor did a (9:28 - 9:32)
documentary on aaron zang okay (9:30 - 9:34)
i mean i suppose you could do a (9:32 - 9:35)
documentary on yourself it would (9:34 - 9:36)
probably be very like (9:35 - 9:38)
yeah (9:36 - 9:40)
we should do a documentary on ourselves (9:38 - 9:43)
but that that documentary (9:40 - 9:46)
uh he goes to (9:43 - 9:48)
orlando florida i think for one of his (9:46 - 9:51)
very first tournaments um and that was (9:48 - 9:52)
like one of the very first world (9:51 - 9:54)
championships i think it was maybe (9:52 - 9:56)
either the first of the second if i i (9:54 - 9:57)
could be completely wrong at least in (9:56 - 9:59)
the united states (9:57 - 10:00)
i went to the (9:59 - 10:02)
california one (10:00 - 10:03)
which i think there's been three in (10:02 - 10:05)
california or maybe two went to (10:03 - 10:07)
california on the nashville one (10:05 - 10:08)
and then the dc one the ec one was the (10:07 - 10:11)
last one before events got i've never (10:08 - 10:13)
been (10:11 - 10:14)
what (10:13 - 10:16)
i've never been to a regionals i've (10:14 - 10:17)
never been to a world it's never been (10:16 - 10:18)
any of it (10:17 - 10:20)
cut me out of all of them will and i met (10:18 - 10:23)
at a national tournament nationals yep (10:20 - 10:26)
yep that was the nationals with black (10:23 - 10:27)
and white (10:26 - 10:31)
indianapolis 2012. and i was playing (10:27 - 10:34)
vanillux (10:31 - 10:34)
well i brought i came for vgc and didn't (10:36 - 10:41)
even know that there were such things as (10:39 - 10:42)
a meta or (10:41 - 10:46)
evs and ivs (10:42 - 10:46)
yeah because when we met you weren't (10:50 - 10:54)
into tcg and then we taught you i think (10:51 - 10:56)
that weekend how to play yep correct (10:54 - 10:58)
and then you saw me get extremely tilted (10:56 - 11:01)
that weekend because i lost (10:58 - 11:03)
to a pokey dad (11:01 - 11:06)
who was playing kobelian (11:03 - 11:07)
and i was playing vanilla expo and alex (11:06 - 11:09)
is weak to steal (11:07 - 11:13)
one of the very few people (11:09 - 11:13)
thanks for the twitch prime i forgot to (11:13 - 11:18)
mute alerts all right alerts a muted um (11:14 - 11:21)
i lost i lost to a pokedex okay you you (11:18 - 11:22)
can still you can still sub and give (11:21 - 11:24)
bits they just won't pop up for the (11:22 - 11:26)
audio you're messing up my audio thank (11:24 - 11:28)
you for the twitch prime uh (11:26 - 11:29)
live show (11:28 - 11:30)
already (11:29 - 11:32)
off the rails derailed (11:30 - 11:33)
so no i (11:32 - 11:35)
the problem with losing to that pokey (11:33 - 11:38)
dad was the judge (11:35 - 11:41)
rolled back two turns and made it (11:38 - 11:43)
impossible for me to win and made it (11:41 - 11:45)
guaranteed for him to win (11:43 - 11:49)
but ins like his ruling was so bad i (11:45 - 11:50)
wasn't mad about losing although losing (11:49 - 11:53)
does suck i was mad that the judge made (11:50 - 11:54)
the worst (11:53 - 11:57)
possible call it's always something (11:54 - 12:01)
outside of you greg 10 years later (11:57 - 12:03)
10 years 10 years later you're still (12:01 - 12:06)
hanging out how much he holds on to (12:03 - 12:08)
these guys he doesn't even play the tcg (12:06 - 12:10)
anymore you do not have to tell me these (12:08 - 12:13)
things i understand fully i'm like (12:10 - 12:16)
pointing out that it's always outside of (12:13 - 12:19)
steve it's oh that's all the judge all (12:16 - 12:22)
the weather all that state (12:19 - 12:25)
that match was that matches did i ever (12:22 - 12:27)

kenosha wisconsin it was it was a it was (12:27 - 12:32)
not a regionals or it was a pretty low (12:30 - 12:34)

think they're called battle roads (12:34 - 12:36)
anymore (12:35 - 12:37)
and (12:36 - 12:40)
i when i played the tcg competitively it (12:37 - 12:42)
would be like me and like uh two to (12:40 - 12:44)
three other like dudes that i played (12:42 - 12:46)
with (12:44 - 12:47)
i still talked to most of those people (12:46 - 12:48)
today and then it would be like irene (12:47 - 12:51)
but irene didn't want to go you don't (12:48 - 12:52)
talk to irene anymore though that's (12:51 - 12:54)
that's the real secret and then the (12:52 - 12:56)
other the other guys not your wife the (12:54 - 12:58)
other guys i normally go with uh they (12:56 - 13:00)

to kenosha (13:02 - 13:06)
myself to go to this battle roads and i (13:03 - 13:07)
get there i don't even remember what (13:06 - 13:10)
deck i'm playing but i'm it's the first (13:07 - 13:12)

i accidentally played two supporters and (13:33 - 13:37)
he said what do you want me and he said (13:35 - 13:40)
oh it's no big deal i'm going to lose (13:37 - 13:41)
any of this (13:40 - 13:44)
wow (13:41 - 13:45)
like it was a very favorable matchup and (13:44 - 13:47)
he was dead drawing anyways and like it (13:45 - 13:49)
was very like i was going to win the (13:47 - 13:50)
match (13:49 - 13:52)
um (13:50 - 13:54)
and i was like i was like yeah but i (13:52 - 13:56)
feel bad i played two supporters like i (13:54 - 13:57)
caught myself after i played the second (13:56 - 13:59)
supporter and like (13:57 - 14:01)
i was like what do you want me to do and (13:59 - 14:02)
he's like i don't know maybe ask a judge (14:01 - 14:04)
so i got up and i walked over (14:02 - 14:06)
uh because there was only one judge for (14:04 - 14:08)
the entire tournament there was only (14:06 - 14:11)
maybe like 40 45 people and i said hey (14:08 - 14:13)
uh i played two supporters but i didn't (14:11 - 14:15)
start the second supporter i played it (14:13 - 14:16)
down and like i shuffled my hand like (14:15 - 14:17)
what do you want me to do and he's like (14:16 - 14:19)
oh that's an auto game loss (14:17 - 14:21)
and i was like oh (14:19 - 14:23)
okay so i went back to the table i sat (14:21 - 14:25)
down i scooped up all my cards and i was (14:23 - 14:26)
like (14:25 - 14:28)
it's an auto loss (14:26 - 14:30)
and he goes oh you were going to win (14:28 - 14:32)
anyways it's no big deal and i was like (14:30 - 14:33)
nah i already told the judge so he (14:32 - 14:35)
already marked me down as an auto loss (14:33 - 14:38)
and then i proceeded to pack my bag and (14:35 - 14:41)
then i left the tournament i drove 45 (14:38 - 14:44)
minutes (14:41 - 14:44)
no look i already look i lost why would (14:45 - 14:51)
i continue playing i lost game one (14:48 - 14:53)
well you could have won the rest of them (14:51 - 14:56)
no no no no no at those like very small (14:53 - 14:58)
tournaments you have to win everything (14:56 - 14:59)
it's always those small tournaments are (14:58 - 15:01)
always like 6-0 is winner and then like (14:59 - 15:04)
5-1 is like (15:01 - 15:06)
look i gave the guy the w (15:04 - 15:08)
that's fine what this is really saying (15:06 - 15:11)
is you weren't playing the game to have (15:08 - 15:12)
fun right you were playing in the game (15:11 - 15:15)
to win right it's it is i feel like it (15:12 - 15:17)
is hard to have fun when you're at a (15:15 - 15:18)
tournament with like none of your (15:17 - 15:20)
friends (15:18 - 15:20)
i have the joy of playing the game i (15:21 - 15:24)
usually don't know anybody that i play (15:22 - 15:26)
my games against i just enjoy playing (15:24 - 15:30)
the game when i went to uh rock america (15:26 - 15:33)
tour in chicago and i vz cheated against (15:30 - 15:34)
a bunch of 10 year olds and i was the (15:33 - 15:36)
only one there i was having a great time (15:34 - 15:38)
making them cry they had to go back to (15:36 - 15:40)
their dad and be like (15:38 - 15:42)
this older gentleman just wrecked my (15:40 - 15:44)
house and i sat there smugly and said (15:42 - 15:45)
yes i did what do you want to do about (15:44 - 15:46)
it (15:45 - 15:48)
i had a wonderful time (15:46 - 15:50)
you know the difference was you didn't (15:48 - 15:53)
mention the word kenosha (15:50 - 15:55)
and then it was like ah look gotta leave (15:53 - 15:57)
anything in wisconsin is automatically (15:55 - 16:00)
starting on the wrong foot (15:57 - 16:00)
all of wisconsin (16:01 - 16:06)
hey milwaukee is okay yeah mm-hmm a (16:04 - 16:11)
madison gorgeous city is okay (16:06 - 16:11)
hey uh speaking of okay pokemon unite (16:12 - 16:18)
finally saved here um not that it's (16:15 - 16:19)
really in trouble i guess that's the (16:18 - 16:21)
joke but egypt is now available in (16:19 - 16:23)
pokemon unite (16:21 - 16:26)
each slash is a melee all-arounder (16:23 - 16:30)
uh with spectacular swordplay that's (16:26 - 16:32)
what it says here on pokemon.com (16:30 - 16:34)
uh it will evolve homeage will evolve (16:32 - 16:36)
into dual blade at level five e just (16:34 - 16:38)
slash at level seven specular or (16:36 - 16:40)
spectral i'm looking at the web page and (16:38 - 16:42)
it says this melee alarm display (16:40 - 16:44)
spectral i was trying to do some (16:42 - 16:47)
editorial enhancements (16:44 - 16:49)
so you weren't you just read the word (16:47 - 16:52)
wrong yeah exactly (16:49 - 16:52)
editorial enhancements (16:53 - 16:58)
this isn't live i'd be cutting out this (16:56 - 17:01)
me being dragged (16:58 - 17:01)
um hey season season well we talked (17:03 - 17:07)
about this i think like a week ago they (17:05 - 17:08)
added the like forty dollar cramer ant (17:07 - 17:12)
skin it's like cowboy stuff (17:08 - 17:13)
yeah (17:12 - 17:14)
there's like a big million dollar (17:13 - 17:17)
tournament or something (17:14 - 17:20)
yeah swords and (17:17 - 17:22)
cowboys go together i don't know i don't (17:20 - 17:24)
really have much else to say about unite (17:22 - 17:25)
i want (17:24 - 17:26)
here's the thing (17:25 - 17:28)
i actually do want to play unite like (17:26 - 17:30)
there's a part of me that is that is (17:28 - 17:33)
itching to play this game (17:30 - 17:35)
but (17:33 - 17:35)
but legends is out (17:36 - 17:41)
and pokemon go has been pretty good (17:39 - 17:43)
recently with like the valentine's day (17:41 - 17:44)
event i (17:43 - 17:45)
i thought the valentine's day event was (17:44 - 17:47)
pretty all right and then johto tours (17:45 - 17:48)
pretty soon (17:47 - 17:50)
and sword and shield is doing the (17:48 - 17:53)
mystery event which we'll get to next (17:50 - 17:55)
and the and the (17:53 - 17:57)
the bird thing (17:55 - 17:58)
the birth thing (17:57 - 18:01)
yeah (17:58 - 18:01)
oh that's right (18:01 - 18:06)
also part of news um (18:03 - 18:08)
it's just there's just so it's it's very (18:06 - 18:10)
hard i feel like sometimes to be a (18:08 - 18:13)
pokemon fan when you like everything (18:10 - 18:14)
whereas like if you just like pokemon go (18:13 - 18:16)
your hands are probably full and you're (18:14 - 18:17)
probably spending a lot of money and if (18:16 - 18:19)
you just like (18:17 - 18:21)
the main series you can ignore this kind (18:19 - 18:24)
of stuff you can ignore the tcg (18:21 - 18:27)
but man when you like everything (18:24 - 18:30)
it's just like unite is just (18:27 - 18:32)
like three steps away of being like the (18:30 - 18:35)
game you do want to put in (18:32 - 18:36)
yeah (18:35 - 18:38)
but i would almost rather play sword and (18:36 - 18:40)
shield than unite and right now i just (18:38 - 18:41)
want to play (18:40 - 18:44)
legends over everything else (18:41 - 18:45)
i mean and if you have any other (18:44 - 18:47)
interests outside of that it your time (18:45 - 18:50)
goes away (18:47 - 18:52)
like i can't play on tuesdays because (18:50 - 18:54)
tuesday is final fantasy raid night (18:52 - 18:58)
wednesdays i go see my friends thursdays (18:54 - 18:59)
are sometimes open but then i'll play (18:58 - 19:01)
arceus fridays are friday and you got to (18:59 - 19:03)
go out on friday night oh you got to go (19:01 - 19:06)
out on friday night excuse me (19:03 - 19:09)
go out where to game center to play (19:06 - 19:11)
games with me oh that's right i wasn't (19:09 - 19:13)
invited that's right (19:11 - 19:15)
you wouldn't have wanted to come (19:13 - 19:17)
saturdays are (19:15 - 19:19)
free-for-alls who knows what's happening (19:17 - 19:21)
on us saturdays are spending four hours (19:19 - 19:23)
in the mall of america walking in (19:21 - 19:27)
circles and then stopping at b-dubs (19:23 - 19:30)
sundays is this (19:27 - 19:31)
good and getting groceries and then (19:30 - 19:34)
monday is just dead weight of a day like (19:31 - 19:37)
doing anything on mondays (19:34 - 19:39)
hurts (19:37 - 19:41)
emotionally physically mentally (19:39 - 19:44)
spiritually (19:41 - 19:44)
you got you got to have a schedule and (19:44 - 19:48)
just it just happens that unite doesn't (19:46 - 19:51)
fit into that schedule if unite on my (19:48 - 19:54)
ipad would support my controller i would (19:51 - 19:57)
probably be playing more unite them (19:54 - 19:59)
agreed (19:57 - 20:00)
um (19:59 - 20:03)
there is a a new raid event in sword and (20:00 - 20:04)
shield (20:03 - 20:05)
sword and shield is still a video game (20:04 - 20:09)
it is still being supported uh there is (20:05 - 20:12)
this is really new though it's not but (20:09 - 20:14)
um (20:12 - 20:17)
it's a good one to repeat (20:14 - 20:19)
because if you're a hardcore because (20:17 - 20:21)
because it's one way to get the rare (20:19 - 20:23)
sweets right people would have possibly (20:21 - 20:24)
gotten the sword and shield for (20:23 - 20:27)
christmas it's february now (20:24 - 20:29)
um hopefully they got sword and shield (20:27 - 20:30)
for christmas instead of brilliant (20:29 - 20:32)
diamond shining pearl (20:30 - 20:35)
oh stop with your hot takes (20:32 - 20:37)
that's not a hot take anymore it's just (20:35 - 20:41)
reality some of your stale takes (20:37 - 20:41)
i thought i muted those alerts i don't (20:43 - 20:47)
know if that came through (20:45 - 20:47)
i don't know if they heard it (20:49 - 20:53)
um (20:52 - 20:54)
it's the star suite in the ribbon suite (20:53 - 20:56)
right those are the ones you can't get (20:54 - 20:58)
except for these events yes yeah so i (20:56 - 21:01)
think it's a good rate event to (20:58 - 21:04)
repeat also it's not (21:01 - 21:07)
um it's not like three days long (21:04 - 21:08)
it goes until so if you're listening to (21:07 - 21:10)
this podcast on monday february 14th (21:08 - 21:13)
happy valentine's day uh get your (21:10 - 21:16)
significant other or mom a love disc (21:13 - 21:19)
happy black monday (21:16 - 21:22)
it goes until february 20th there's a (21:19 - 21:23)
two percent chance in five star rates to (21:22 - 21:25)
get a shiny meal series if you were a (21:23 - 21:29)
hardcore collector and you wanted (21:25 - 21:32)
um every different military i'll cry me (21:29 - 21:34)
to be shiny i believe you would need (21:32 - 21:35)
seven of them (21:34 - 21:36)
so (21:35 - 21:39)
it is a good event to farm the thing (21:36 - 21:40)
that (21:39 - 21:42)
i guess probably makes this difference (21:40 - 21:44)
different than what it was like a year (21:42 - 21:45)
ago (21:44 - 21:47)
is not a lot of people are playing sword (21:45 - 21:49)
and shield (21:47 - 21:51)
is that you're on your own kid (21:49 - 21:52)
so like (21:51 - 21:55)
going through raids with people (21:52 - 21:56)
and like other people searching for (21:55 - 21:58)
raids and you searching for raids and (21:56 - 22:00)
like going through them would be a lot (21:58 - 22:01)
faster even if you had like three or (22:00 - 22:04)
four people doing the same thing as you (22:01 - 22:05)
um (22:04 - 22:07)
i have one shot email series it would be (22:05 - 22:10)
nice that this event is up to try to go (22:07 - 22:13)
for another six or just another handful (22:10 - 22:15)
maybe i think i have one here's the (22:13 - 22:17)
thing every time i think about doing (22:15 - 22:18)
these things i think about the y comb (22:17 - 22:20)
and that deflates (22:18 - 22:24)
my desire so much maybe the y comma is (22:20 - 22:25)
better (22:24 - 22:28)
because not many people are playing (22:25 - 22:30)
the amount of people didn't change that (22:28 - 22:32)
never updated (22:30 - 22:34)
yeah you're right (22:32 - 22:35)
and the fact that when it finally did (22:34 - 22:36)
operate i'm like oh there's a rate it (22:35 - 22:39)
said oh that's gone i just showed you (22:36 - 22:42)
something from four hours ago (22:39 - 22:45)
welcome to the wycombe (22:42 - 22:45)
look (22:47 - 22:53)
what else is you mean you're not wrong (22:49 - 22:53)
uh yeah it's but (22:54 - 22:57)
like i said if you just got sword and (22:56 - 22:58)
shield for christmas and you were trying (22:57 - 23:00)
to get all of them this is like the only (22:58 - 23:02)
way to get like the star suite or ribbon (23:00 - 23:03)
suite (23:02 - 23:05)
um so that at that event is happening uh (23:03 - 23:07)
it's a cool pokemon (23:05 - 23:10)
something to do uh also (23:07 - 23:12)
happening if it's it's monday if you're (23:10 - 23:13)
listening to this (23:12 - 23:15)
14th again happy valentine's day go (23:13 - 23:19)
catch your grandma alola mola um (23:15 - 23:22)
let's see that's the bad one (23:19 - 23:22)
yeah (23:22 - 23:25)
uh that's the bad one (23:22 - 23:26)
make sure (23:25 - 23:30)

whatever utc time (23:38 - 23:43)
it ends up being like 7 00 p.m central (23:40 - 23:46)
time on thursday night which is i think (23:43 - 23:48)
midnight utc (23:46 - 23:49)
and then (23:48 - 23:51)
the tournament is going to start and (23:49 - 23:52)
then people are going to come into my (23:51 - 23:54)
twitch stream specifically and be like (23:52 - 23:57)
oh yeah the tournament can i sign up (23:54 - 23:59)
no you can't sign up the tournament (23:57 - 24:01)
started (23:59 - 24:03)
yeah what website do i go to to sign up (24:01 - 24:05)
you don't know no website you do it in (24:03 - 24:07)
the game (24:05 - 24:09)

two options once you go to verses one's (24:11 - 24:17)
battle competition and then one is uh (24:13 - 24:19)
stadium something (24:17 - 24:22)
i don't even remember lifetime movies (24:19 - 24:23)
you go to the one on the left (24:22 - 24:25)
yeah no one has ever clicked the one on (24:23 - 24:26)
the right i don't even know what the one (24:25 - 24:28)
on the right does i have accidentally (24:26 - 24:29)
clicked the one on the right and i don't (24:28 - 24:31)
know i still don't know what it does (24:29 - 24:32)
if no one knows what that button does (24:31 - 24:34)
three years later sword and shield no (24:32 - 24:36)
one knows what the right side is that (24:34 - 24:39)
fixes the white comb (24:36 - 24:40)
so (24:39 - 24:42)
you go there it'll say casual battle (24:40 - 24:44)
ranked battle online competitions you go (24:42 - 24:46)
to online competitions then you hit (24:44 - 24:48)

the arakuta era cuda yeah like i think (25:18 - 25:24)
that the spinney (25:21 - 25:24)
once the tournament starts you have to (25:25 - 25:29)
do three matches when it was originally (25:27 - 25:32)
announced on january 15th (25:29 - 25:34)
one match they said one and then they (25:32 - 25:36)
baited and switched me so like one and (25:34 - 25:38)
done baby (25:36 - 25:39)
and that was i have to suffer through (25:38 - 25:41)
three three you don't have to win them (25:39 - 25:43)
you just to play them (25:41 - 25:46)
also this question was asked a lot can (25:43 - 25:48)
you use rental teams no you cannot you (25:46 - 25:50)
have to use your own team you cannot use (25:48 - 25:52)
a rental team it is considered an (25:50 - 25:55)
official tournament (25:52 - 25:57)
that's also why you can only register (25:55 - 26:00)
for one nso or whatever one switch (25:57 - 26:01)

ball guy (26:46 - 26:50)

the lack of luxury ball products and my (26:50 - 26:56)
ability to make luxury balls (26:54 - 26:58)
in legends arceus is currently the (26:56 - 27:00)
biggest stressor i have in my life that (26:58 - 27:02)

uh final bit of news before we take a (27:20 - 27:24)
break is uh brilliant stars is coming (27:22 - 27:27)
out on february 25th (27:24 - 27:28)
uh (27:27 - 27:30)
that is the official release date of the (27:28 - 27:32)
newest tcg set (27:30 - 27:36)
somebody i know opened some (27:32 - 27:40)
and it's not the 25th it's not yes i did (27:36 - 27:41)
have an embargo (27:40 - 27:44)
from the pokemon company they did full (27:41 - 27:46)
disclosure the pokemon company sent me a (27:44 - 27:49)
box of brilliant stars no gas i followed (27:46 - 27:51)
bargaining broke street date no i don't (27:49 - 27:53)
know (27:51 - 27:55)
now this weekend was pretty play i (27:53 - 27:56)
called (27:55 - 27:59)
the rules and the laws this weekend was (27:56 - 28:03)
pre-release weekend i'm sure (27:59 - 28:03)
it was pre-release weekend so i was (28:08 - 28:14)
allowed to open it you can get the build (28:10 - 28:16)
and battle boxes early i think they sell (28:14 - 28:18)
them at like game stop or something i (28:16 - 28:19)
really thought you were gonna say build (28:18 - 28:21)
a bear and i was like what does that (28:19 - 28:24)
have to do with this so you can now go (28:21 - 28:26)
to build a bear and buy cards and buy (28:24 - 28:28)
cards i wouldn't be surprised if that (28:26 - 28:29)
was our future (28:28 - 28:31)
and then you could take a charizard and (28:29 - 28:33)
put it as the heart of your (28:31 - 28:36)
vaporeon um do we i think we talked (28:33 - 28:38)
about set sizes last week uh so (28:36 - 28:40)
brilliant stars is about 170 cards which (28:38 - 28:42)
is the smallest set (28:40 - 28:45)
for the sword and shield series uh a lot (28:42 - 28:48)
of these other sets were like 190 200. (28:45 - 28:50)
fusion strike was like 270 it was (28:48 - 28:52)
disgusting (28:50 - 28:54)
uh that's way too many cards (28:52 - 28:56)
and (28:54 - 28:56)
i i do like to give the spotlight i do (28:57 - 29:01)
like to recommend when sets feel good (28:59 - 29:04)
initially i think um (29:01 - 29:06)
like when champion's path came out it (29:04 - 29:08)
had like a bunch of like buzz and stuff (29:06 - 29:09)
because there was a charizard in that (29:08 - 29:10)
set but (29:09 - 29:12)
uh mick champion's path was actually (29:10 - 29:14)
kind of terrible to open because all you (29:12 - 29:17)
got was machamp like non-stop and it was (29:14 - 29:19)
not a great set overall even though it (29:17 - 29:21)
had a lot of buzz i think the (29:19 - 29:23)
celebrations even though it's a pretty (29:21 - 29:25)
small set i think it's like 60 cards i (29:23 - 29:26)
do think that if you can find (29:25 - 29:28)
celebrations in stores at like a target (29:26 - 29:29)
or something i do think it's worth (29:28 - 29:31)
buying even if you're not like a huge (29:29 - 29:32)
tcg person i think they're just (29:31 - 29:35)
genuinely fun to open and collect um and (29:32 - 29:36)
i'm getting that vibe from brilliant (29:35 - 29:37)
stars (29:36 - 29:40)
i think because the set isn't huge it's (29:37 - 29:43)
not 200 plus cards uh and there is there (29:40 - 29:46)
is some really great cards like arceus (29:43 - 29:48)
uh is a fantastic art there are (29:46 - 29:50)
charizards in this set (29:48 - 29:52)
take it for what it's worth i mean that (29:50 - 29:54)
they're gonna they're gonna be valuable (29:52 - 29:55)
no matter what (29:54 - 29:56)
um (29:55 - 29:58)
but there's also like really good cards (29:56 - 30:00)
competitively like lumineon which is (29:58 - 30:03)
just a copy of like tapu lele gx from (30:00 - 30:05)
the alola it's just a very good card so (30:03 - 30:07)
i think between the set (30:05 - 30:09)
the sense of having competitive cards (30:07 - 30:10)
and having expensive chart like (30:09 - 30:12)
competitive would be lumineon expensive (30:10 - 30:14)
would be charizard fun to collect would (30:12 - 30:16)
be like arceus and some other stuff uh i (30:14 - 30:19)
think this is maybe a set that you might (30:16 - 30:20)
want to if you don't collect cards you (30:19 - 30:22)
might want to go to like target if you (30:20 - 30:23)
can find it and maybe just pick up an (30:22 - 30:26)
etb for like 40 bucks and i genuinely (30:23 - 30:27)
think you'd probably have a pretty okay (30:26 - 30:30)
time opening it i mean i can't say like (30:27 - 30:32)
a great time because you could get like (30:30 - 30:34)
the worst booster packs ever and (30:32 - 30:36)
hopefully you don't but ideally you know (30:34 - 30:38)
if you get two or three like hits out of (30:36 - 30:40)
a 40 uh etb (30:38 - 30:43)
elite trainer box um i think you'd be (30:40 - 30:45)
pretty satisfied with your money i know (30:43 - 30:47)
very little (30:45 - 30:50)
about the tcg but this cynthia's (30:47 - 30:52)
ambition card is amazing (30:50 - 30:53)
oh yeah that's another fun thing about (30:52 - 30:56)
this set is there's um there you have a (30:53 - 30:58)
chance of getting two good cards in a (30:56 - 30:59)
set (30:58 - 31:01)
so they always put like (30:59 - 31:03)
they they oh i have well this is this is (31:01 - 31:05)
bad for audio i'm going to spoil (31:03 - 31:07)
something for our video so that they (31:05 - 31:09)
come with the code cards right (31:07 - 31:10)
yeah yeah yeah you can see that they (31:09 - 31:13)
have a white border and a black border (31:10 - 31:15)
so you can actually spoil the booster (31:13 - 31:17)
pack for yourself because if it has a (31:15 - 31:19)
black border it means that it's going to (31:17 - 31:21)
be really (31:19 - 31:23)
good and if you have a white border you (31:21 - 31:24)
just got like a trash booster pack also (31:23 - 31:26)
the sun just came out i'm getting (31:24 - 31:28)
blinded (31:26 - 31:29)
what (31:28 - 31:30)
okay we're good we're good we're good i (31:29 - 31:34)
just had to okay so um (31:30 - 31:38)
so even even in a white one which is bad (31:34 - 31:40)
uh even in a white one which is bad you (31:38 - 31:42)
can still get the really fancy trainer (31:40 - 31:44)
um and so they have these really (31:42 - 31:46)
gorgeous trainer cards in these set and (31:44 - 31:48)
they can even appear in the white ones (31:46 - 31:49)
they're called i think they're called (31:48 - 31:51)
trainer rares (31:49 - 31:53)
um but they have like a specific number (31:51 - 31:56)
it'll say tg30 so there's like 30 of (31:53 - 31:58)
these so here's this is really bad for (31:56 - 32:00)
our audio podcast i'm sorry this is bill (31:58 - 32:03)
bill and evie and then um i'll just show (32:00 - 32:05)
one more here is uh (32:03 - 32:08)
blue and vaporeon so not only do they (32:05 - 32:11)
have like your your very your charizards (32:08 - 32:12)
your arceuses (32:11 - 32:13)
your (32:12 - 32:15)
lumineons (32:13 - 32:17)
they have these these really great (32:15 - 32:18)
trainer cards that are really fun to (32:17 - 32:21)
collect as well so (32:18 - 32:25)
so i'm looking online and (32:21 - 32:28)
every version of cynthia's ambition is (32:25 - 32:29)
better (32:28 - 32:32)

and they're like do you have any milton (33:09 - 33:12)
cards i'll trade you whatever and it's (33:10 - 33:14)
like yeah i guess (33:12 - 33:17)
do you know you know which tcg folks are (33:14 - 33:20)
even better than those folks (33:17 - 33:22)
it's the ones the kids they start out (33:20 - 33:25)
with a pack rapper and then they trade (33:22 - 33:27)
that for like a really bad comment and (33:25 - 33:29)
then they try to trade that for like a (33:27 - 33:31)
slightly better comment and they try to (33:29 - 33:33)
see where if they can go from a pack (33:31 - 33:35)
rapper up to like a really good card (33:33 - 33:37)
through training if they can go from a (33:35 - 33:40)
safety pin to getting a house yes yes (33:37 - 33:44)
it's the pokemon version of that (33:40 - 33:45)
you know what i wanted to do no one (33:44 - 33:47)
steal this (33:45 - 33:49)
no one no one's allowed to steal this tm (33:47 - 33:51)
tmtm (33:49 - 33:53)
what i want to do yeah this is trademark (33:51 - 33:58)
i want to i want to go to japan (33:53 - 34:00)
and i want to try to finish some of my (33:58 - 34:03)
japanese sets by trading with people in (34:00 - 34:04)
japan (34:03 - 34:06)
and have both english and japanese cards (34:04 - 34:06)
and like (34:06 - 34:10)
like uh like base so that in in japan (34:06 - 34:11)
they released sword and then they (34:10 - 34:12)
released shield they're two different (34:11 - 34:14)
sets and each side had 80 cards (34:12 - 34:16)
um and then in america they really sword (34:14 - 34:19)
and shield which is like 213 cards or (34:16 - 34:23)
whatever um and for both sword and for (34:19 - 34:25)
shield i'm missing like six cards each (34:23 - 34:27)
and they're like the rainbow rare cards (34:25 - 34:28)
but i have (34:27 - 34:30)
duplicate rainbow rares so i'm really (34:28 - 34:31)
only missing like 12 cars to complete (34:30 - 34:33)
the set and like i guess the easy thing (34:31 - 34:34)
to do is just like go on ebay and just (34:33 - 34:37)
like hear the six cards i'm missing and (34:34 - 34:38)
adam's people in japan you could (34:37 - 34:42)
literally say hey minions no but (34:38 - 34:44)
the cool thing about japan is because (34:42 - 34:45)
they have so many pokemon centers and (34:44 - 34:47)
because they're always doing tournaments (34:45 - 34:49)
they're like tuesday night tournaments (34:47 - 34:50)
thursday night tournaments saturday (34:49 - 34:52)
morning tournaments sunday morning (34:50 - 34:53)
tournaments (34:52 - 34:56)
and like you don't have to go to some (34:53 - 34:58)
obscure card shop right you just go to a (34:56 - 35:00)
pokemon center they have the tournament (34:58 - 35:02)
area or the where people are playing (35:00 - 35:05)
cards and be like i have all these like (35:02 - 35:07)
i think the the interesting thing would (35:05 - 35:10)
be like how can i conduct a trade look i (35:07 - 35:12)
almost got abducted by a cult yeah you (35:10 - 35:14)
need i didn't know any japanese (35:12 - 35:17)
so cbs n (35:14 - 35:17)
and they will take it from there to me (35:23 - 35:29)
my son lizardmon (35:25 - 35:29)
but that would be i would want to try to (35:31 - 35:36)
complete the sets i'm missing (35:33 - 35:38)
that would be really great (35:36 - 35:40)
uh okay i mean if you have a month to (35:38 - 35:44)
spend in japan absolutely yeah (35:40 - 35:45)
that would be that would be a full (35:44 - 35:47)
series okay so we're going to take a (35:45 - 35:49)
break uh when we get back from our break (35:47 - 35:51)
we're going to talk about legends uh (35:49 - 35:52)
there's a little bit of news regarding (35:51 - 35:53)
legends (35:52 - 35:55)
there's a patch and i don't know what it (35:53 - 35:57)

look how we we could we'll talk about (36:16 - 36:21)
the patch in a second i got this don't (36:19 - 36:23)
you're throwing me off my rhythm greg (36:21 - 36:24)
if you want to never have a rhythm (36:23 - 36:25)
people want to hear about pokemon (36:24 - 36:27)
legends they also want to hear about ign (36:25 - 36:30)
this is off ign that was the transition (36:27 - 36:31)
uh who ever wants to hear anything about (36:30 - 36:34)
ign look this is just the news article (36:31 - 36:37)
i'm reporting on here uh (36:34 - 36:40)
nintendo has announced that pokemon (36:37 - 36:43)
legends arceus has sold 6.5 million (36:40 - 36:46)
copies in its first week of release (36:43 - 36:47)
wow (36:46 - 36:49)
then there they tweeted about this (36:47 - 36:52)
nintendo of america tweeted about this (36:49 - 36:54)
uh (36:52 - 36:56)
so this is (36:54 - 36:57)
the (36:56 - 37:02)
fastest selling mainline switch pokemon (36:57 - 37:04)
game which i think has been lost in (37:02 - 37:06)
translation here i've been seeing on the (37:04 - 37:08)
internet this this is the fastest (37:06 - 37:11)
selling pokemon game ever (37:08 - 37:15)
it is the fastest selling switch pokemon (37:11 - 37:17)
game ever (37:15 - 37:21)
and it's not really by much but um (37:17 - 37:24)
uh arceus has outpaced both pokemon (37:21 - 37:26)
sword and shield and brilliant diamond (37:24 - 37:28)
shining pearl in their first week of (37:26 - 37:30)
sales the latest mainline games and the (37:28 - 37:33)
ds remakes managed to sell six million (37:30 - 37:34)
copies (37:33 - 37:37)
and this sold 6.5 million copies (37:34 - 37:40)
um i don't remember (37:37 - 37:41)
how much let's go they don't have let's (37:40 - 37:43)
go pikachu let's go eevee (37:41 - 37:44)
here (37:43 - 37:46)
uh brilliant diamond and shining pearl (37:44 - 37:49)
are the ninth best selling switch games (37:46 - 37:51)
of all time currently (37:49 - 37:53)
that's a bummer uh let's go pizza let's (37:51 - 37:55)
go easy are the (37:53 - 37:58)
eighth best selling switch games of all (37:55 - 37:59)
time (37:58 - 38:01)
sword and shield are the fifth best (37:59 - 38:03)
selling switch games of all time (38:01 - 38:05)
so it's still unsure at the moment if (38:03 - 38:08)
arceus will get up to that point (38:05 - 38:10)
um (38:08 - 38:12)
arceus is the second (38:10 - 38:16)
fastest selling switch game of all time (38:12 - 38:19)
with animal crossing new horizons being (38:16 - 38:21)
number one i actually think sword and (38:19 - 38:23)
shield was number one (38:21 - 38:26)
until (38:23 - 38:26)
animal crossing (38:26 - 38:31)
that makes sense i think i remember (38:29 - 38:34)
correctly um i left animal crossing to (38:31 - 38:38)
play what pokemon game (38:34 - 38:38)
didn't animal crossing did not come out (38:39 - 38:42)
before sword and shield (38:40 - 38:44)
yeah but i literally (38:42 - 38:47)
i left one of these to go place oh (38:44 - 38:49)
probably the dlc the deal oh the dlc (38:47 - 38:51)
yeah yeah (38:49 - 38:53)
i wrote my standard mayor note y'all (38:51 - 38:55)
you're on your own you're on your own (38:53 - 38:57)
there's a better thing to do bye (38:55 - 38:59)
uh hazel you ruined my town i hate you (38:57 - 39:01)
forever bye (38:59 - 39:03)
it's like really weird because they like (39:01 - 39:04)
it (39:03 - 39:06)
it's not weird to this article maybe it (39:04 - 39:07)
is weird to this article because the (39:06 - 39:09)
article says like the first week a week (39:07 - 39:12)
is seven days legends sold 6.5 million (39:09 - 39:14)
in seven days (39:12 - 39:15)
but the (39:14 - 39:17)
later on in this article it says animal (39:15 - 39:19)
crossing new horizons became the fastest (39:17 - 39:21)
seller with (39:19 - 39:26)
11.77 million copies in 11 days (39:21 - 39:26)
i don't know why 11 was like the (39:26 - 39:30)
threshold here (39:28 - 39:32)
like what did it sell in seven days uh (39:30 - 39:33)
that would be a good comparison that (39:32 - 39:34)
many (39:33 - 39:37)
um (39:34 - 39:37)
uh but yeah i don't i don't think (39:37 - 39:40)
anything is gonna pass (39:39 - 39:42)
i'm still curious and we'll never know (39:40 - 39:45)
of course because (39:42 - 39:45)
it's not every (39:46 - 39:50)
year you get a global pandemic but i am (39:47 - 39:52)
curious i mean it could be (39:50 - 39:54)
maybe yeah maybe at this rate it could (39:52 - 39:56)
be i'm just curious (39:54 - 39:57)
the timing of (39:56 - 40:00)
lockdowns for the world and the timing (39:57 - 40:02)
of covid worldwide and then the timing (40:00 - 40:05)
of animal crossing (40:02 - 40:07)
that had to play a factor right oh it (40:05 - 40:08)
certainly helps but (40:07 - 40:11)
animal crossing is a very popular game (40:08 - 40:14)
just you just you can't discount that no (40:11 - 40:18)
if they ever combine these two (40:14 - 40:18)
the world will stop (40:18 - 40:21)
oh if they like are you saying like a (40:22 - 40:26)
pokemon animal crossing yeah they merge (40:24 - 40:27)
those together they march those two (40:26 - 40:30)
together that's like when nintendo's (40:27 - 40:32)
like we are about to go bankrupt release (40:30 - 40:34)
the gold (40:32 - 40:36)
that will come flying into stores and (40:34 - 40:40)
they will be saved forever yeah (40:36 - 40:40)
that would be that i'm i'm yeah (40:41 - 40:47)
i'm curious because (40:44 - 40:49)
we know that they released two copies of (40:47 - 40:51)
a game right red and blue gold and (40:49 - 40:54)
silver ruby and sapphire at times not (40:51 - 40:58)
every time yes go on sword and shield (40:54 - 41:00)
and you look at you look at games like (40:58 - 41:02)
emerald or crystal (41:00 - 41:06)
and they do not sell particularly well (41:02 - 41:08)
compared to their counterparts (41:06 - 41:11)
um the exception to that was pokemon (41:08 - 41:13)
yellow sold incredibly well i think it (41:11 - 41:16)
sold like 17 million copies or something (41:13 - 41:18)
yeah like that was timing yeah well that (41:16 - 41:19)
was awesome because they're like hey (41:18 - 41:22)
anime but in game form (41:19 - 41:23)
yeah (41:22 - 41:25)
timing on that was really good i mean (41:23 - 41:28)
red and blue were already hot hot hot (41:25 - 41:29)
well (41:28 - 41:32)
see the thing is it took a while for red (41:29 - 41:35)
and blue to get to boil (41:32 - 41:37)
and when it was at boyle that's when (41:35 - 41:39)
yellow came out yep so everybody's like (41:37 - 41:41)
i'm gonna get the new pokemon i'm gonna (41:39 - 41:44)
get the one with pikachu on the cover (41:41 - 41:47)
yeah and then uh this time with jesse (41:44 - 41:49)
and james (41:47 - 41:51)
and (41:49 - 41:54)
leading up to legends (41:51 - 41:55)
specifically after the fact that they (41:54 - 41:58)
showed irida and (41:55 - 42:00)
adaman (41:58 - 42:02)
i kind of thought to myself (42:00 - 42:03)
and we talked about this why didn't they (42:02 - 42:06)
just haul a ruby and sapphire (42:03 - 42:08)
you put one in one version you put one (42:06 - 42:10)
on the other at the end of the day (42:08 - 42:12)
they're similar (42:10 - 42:14)
game's been out for two weeks (42:12 - 42:16)
we already talked about up two credits (42:14 - 42:18)
but up to credits you do pick one of the (42:16 - 42:19)
two (42:18 - 42:21)
you pick them very last minute and it (42:19 - 42:22)
really (42:21 - 42:24)
spoiler doesn't matter which one you (42:22 - 42:25)
pick (42:24 - 42:28)
uh i disagree (42:25 - 42:28)
there (42:29 - 42:33)
i was not traveling in my time of need (42:30 - 42:35)
without my boyfriend at my side thank (42:33 - 42:39)
you very much i can see here yes (42:35 - 42:40)
i mean at the end of the game you're (42:39 - 42:41)
still getting tiago you're still getting (42:40 - 42:45)
palkia you're still getting both the (42:41 - 42:48)
centaur orbs or whatever whatever those (42:45 - 42:49)
are called (42:48 - 42:51)
they're globes (42:49 - 42:54)
so you're not like get any globes well (42:51 - 42:56)
once once you get credits you just have (42:54 - 42:58)
to go to their respective camps and then (42:56 - 42:59)
talk to them (42:58 - 43:02)
they ask so much of me i gotta go to (42:59 - 43:05)
them i just saved the world they can't (43:02 - 43:06)
come to me (43:05 - 43:09)
and they have to go stand looking off (43:06 - 43:11)
into the horizon like what choices have (43:09 - 43:13)
i made that brought us here and you have (43:11 - 43:15)
to battle them (43:13 - 43:19)
and some somewhere lost in this game in (43:15 - 43:20)
a game where they're like ah no one (43:19 - 43:22)
likes the pokemon battle i'm scared of (43:20 - 43:27)
you dude give me a worm pole (43:22 - 43:27)
leaders (43:27 - 43:31)
that you that communities (43:28 - 43:33)
religious communities look up to these (43:31 - 43:34)
leaders (43:33 - 43:37)
that are also pokemon trainers (43:34 - 43:39)
still do not know how a formal battle (43:37 - 43:42)
works when you fight adam in post game (43:39 - 43:44)
he's like here's like five pokemon pick (43:42 - 43:45)
which one you want to attack like no man (43:44 - 43:48)
horrible battles don't exist one more (43:45 - 43:50)
time you're asking you are out of time (43:48 - 43:54)
get your tree out of here pull them away (43:50 - 43:57)
you are asking a primitive culture (43:54 - 43:59)
to establish formalized rules for a (43:57 - 44:01)
thing that's never happened the real (43:59 - 44:05)
issue is you who came from a different (44:01 - 44:08)
pokemon universe where it was one at a (44:05 - 44:10)
time or two at a time (44:08 - 44:13)
are like holding to your old ways rather (44:10 - 44:15)
than adapting to the situation in front (44:13 - 44:17)
of you this is lovely (44:15 - 44:20)
let me set that three pokemon look this (44:17 - 44:22)
is the one time that will's colonizer (44:20 - 44:24)
argument actually works (44:22 - 44:26)
look let's rotation battle make it (44:24 - 44:28)
happen i don't know (44:26 - 44:30)
triple battery (44:28 - 44:32)
rotation (44:30 - 44:34)
what at least (44:32 - 44:37)
at least there is what in the trials in (44:34 - 44:40)
alola (44:37 - 44:40)
when you're when you're fighting totem (44:41 - 44:46)
laurentis laurentis isn't a pokemon (44:43 - 44:49)
trainer so when like uh when like cherum (44:46 - 44:52)
or whatever comfey comes out of nowhere (44:49 - 44:54)
you're like ah you know primitive (44:52 - 44:56)
pokemon there are no rules there's no (44:54 - 44:59)
one bossing you around adaman is over (44:56 - 45:02)
here telling three poke when you fight (44:59 - 45:04)
sabby or whatever her name is she's like (45:02 - 45:06)
challenge me i'm the best here's an (45:04 - 45:08)
elective fire a rhyperior and a meg (45:06 - 45:10)
mortar all in this hallway and you're (45:08 - 45:11)
like (45:10 - 45:13)
girl i gotta glammy out right now like (45:11 - 45:14)
wait (45:13 - 45:16)
can i can i send out my weasel too is (45:14 - 45:19)
that okay video game or lack of being (45:16 - 45:22)
prepared and be our strict mindset of i (45:19 - 45:25)
can only send one thing out hold you (45:22 - 45:28)
back but also proves to them (45:25 - 45:30)
that you are a strong trainer that you (45:28 - 45:33)
can take on their full force with your (45:30 - 45:34)
puny (45:33 - 45:38)
locked in step brain patterns (45:34 - 45:39)
that's how you win (45:38 - 45:41)
their plus (45:39 - 45:42)
they don't know how to raise their (45:41 - 45:44)
pokemon evenly they've turned off xp (45:42 - 45:46)
share because they'll send out a level (45:44 - 45:48)
5000 (45:46 - 45:50)
glaceon and then two level two evs (45:48 - 45:52)
they're like this is fair (45:50 - 45:54)
well yeah like in in the battle of (45:52 - 45:56)
wasabi it was like (45:54 - 46:00)
electavire was 30. magmortar was 30 and (45:56 - 46:04)
riperior was 65. yeah yeah (46:00 - 46:05)
they don't know what levels are they (46:04 - 46:07)
don't know how to raise anything you are (46:05 - 46:08)
here to say (46:07 - 46:10)
this is what an elite four is i'm gonna (46:08 - 46:12)
take over this mountain all of the (46:10 - 46:14)
trainers in this game that send out like (46:12 - 46:16)
six pokemon they're like the 12 year old (46:14 - 46:19)
version of you where you like you only (46:16 - 46:21)
power up your starter and then you have (46:19 - 46:23)
just a bunch of filler pokemon because (46:21 - 46:25)
you like don't want to level them up the (46:23 - 46:27)
only difference is like the 12 year old (46:25 - 46:28)
version of you is restricted to use one (46:27 - 46:30)
at a time and they're like ah just send (46:28 - 46:32)
them all out at once whatever (46:30 - 46:35)
this is the pokemon company (46:32 - 46:37)
because so many people complained so (46:35 - 46:39)
many will anderson's out there were like (46:37 - 46:41)
i hate the fact that they have enforced (46:39 - 46:44)
experience share (46:41 - 46:45)
now they're like well look at what the (46:44 - 46:47)
world would look like if we didn't force (46:45 - 46:50)
you to use experience share what happens (46:47 - 46:53)
look at these rubes and their poor (46:50 - 46:57)
pokemon choices and levels (46:53 - 46:57)
what i was going back to is it it's (47:02 - 47:05)
still slightly weird that they didn't (47:03 - 47:07)
just do the thing of releasing two (47:05 - 47:09)
versions (47:07 - 47:11)
like okay that was a kind of a risk in (47:09 - 47:13)
itself to put like (47:11 - 47:15)
like they they know right they know the (47:13 - 47:16)
the (47:15 - 47:18)
amount of fans that buy two versions (47:16 - 47:19)
okay so (47:18 - 47:21)
you're you're positing two things that (47:19 - 47:24)
are incorrect number one (47:21 - 47:26)
people don't buy the emeralds the (47:24 - 47:28)
platinums because they say i already (47:26 - 47:30)
played this game in the two versions (47:28 - 47:33)
there is no predecessor game to this (47:30 - 47:34)
number two i (47:33 - 47:36)
i will continue to argue that this goes (47:34 - 47:38)
back to (47:36 - 47:41)
they introduced so many changes that if (47:38 - 47:43)
they had had that one extra level of (47:41 - 47:45)
complexity it would have turned people (47:43 - 47:49)
off the cards fallen apart (47:45 - 47:49)
they can sell us a second version in (47:49 - 47:55)
november exactly exactly right they (47:52 - 47:56)
could (47:55 - 47:58)
pokemon legends (47:56 - 48:00)
coming to selling game they got they got (47:58 - 48:02)
they are like everybody working from (48:00 - 48:04)
home you are triple overtime because we (48:02 - 48:06)
gotta get another game out because we do (48:04 - 48:08)
not have gen nine ready i kind of didn't (48:06 - 48:10)
think about it go go go (48:08 - 48:12)
because they did they did that when when (48:10 - 48:14)
sun and moon came out that it had to (48:12 - 48:16)
come out because it was the 20th (48:14 - 48:17)
anniversary right like they couldn't (48:16 - 48:20)
miss that date they couldn't extend that (48:17 - 48:21)
any any further (48:20 - 48:24)
it had to come out they had pokemon go (48:21 - 48:25)
that year they were right in that (48:24 - 48:28)
pokemon go wave they had to ship that (48:25 - 48:28)
game (48:28 - 48:34)
and then it was what september or august (48:28 - 48:35)
where they announced ultrasound (48:34 - 48:37)
ultramoon (48:35 - 48:40)
and it was like this game is coming out (48:37 - 48:43)
364 days after sun and moon not even a (48:40 - 48:46)
full year we are we are moving this game (48:43 - 48:48)
out and that game is better right (48:46 - 48:49)
everything except for the story (48:48 - 48:51)
ultrasound ultramoon (48:49 - 48:52)
better game (48:51 - 48:55)
mechanically better story lacking yeah (48:52 - 48:58)
the story is the only downfall (48:55 - 49:00)
one would argue that makes that game (48:58 - 49:04)
worse but go on (49:00 - 49:04)
i mean to be fair there is a point where (49:04 - 49:10)
the ultra recon squad were very obsessed (49:07 - 49:12)
with the ferfrew i would say that's a (49:10 - 49:14)
pretty good story in itself (49:12 - 49:16)
i mean there are high points there are (49:14 - 49:17)
definitely (49:16 - 49:18)
sorry (49:17 - 49:20)
it's like saying there are high points (49:18 - 49:22)
in buffy season six it's still a bad (49:20 - 49:23)
season (49:22 - 49:24)
hey (49:23 - 49:29)
hey hey with your hot takes (49:24 - 49:29)
but you're right they could they could (49:31 - 49:35)
just they could just put out an ultimate (49:32 - 49:36)
version of legends they could do that i (49:35 - 49:38)
didn't absolutely we've added we've (49:36 - 49:41)
added 400 more pokemon for you to (49:38 - 49:43)
collect same story cause that's how we (49:41 - 49:45)
do third versions (49:43 - 49:47)
and have fun (49:45 - 49:49)
so so sword and shield is the second (49:47 - 49:51)
best-selling pokemon game of all time it (49:49 - 49:54)
did it officially passed gold and silver (49:51 - 49:55)
you know a couple weeks ago when they (49:54 - 49:57)
released sales numbers (49:55 - 50:00)
those games can go in the dust (49:57 - 50:00)
do you really think that it was (50:01 - 50:09)
there was some hesitation like (50:05 - 50:11)
like the difference between 6 million (50:09 - 50:13)
copies and six point five million copies (50:11 - 50:15)
in the first week not a lot (50:13 - 50:18)
i mean a half a million is a lot but (50:15 - 50:20)
there's quite quite a few like yes half (50:18 - 50:21)
a million (50:20 - 50:23)
million viewers that would be a big (50:21 - 50:26)
change okay half a million is a lot to (50:23 - 50:28)
other franchises i would not say it's a (50:26 - 50:31)
lot to pokemon uh that's like that's (50:28 - 50:35)
like oh all of what conquest sold like (50:31 - 50:38)
yeah it's a lot (50:35 - 50:41)
but i wonder if if there wasn't such bad (50:38 - 50:44)
press (50:41 - 50:44)
even even if you were like well it was (50:44 - 50:47)
just limited to reddit it was just (50:45 - 50:49)
limited to twitter like it still did (50:47 - 50:52)
make it to like polygon and ign and like (50:49 - 50:54)
these websites that like casual fans (50:52 - 50:57)
read these websites that literally (50:54 - 50:59)
drag the internet for any hint of a (50:57 - 51:00)
story because they have to get four (50:59 - 51:03)
stories out a day is not like a rigging (51:00 - 51:05)
thing like oh because they reported on (51:03 - 51:06)
it (51:05 - 51:09)
until forbes or newsweek's reports on it (51:06 - 51:11)
because those people have a lot to do (51:09 - 51:12)
i'm pretty sure (51:11 - 51:14)
and newsweek did report on it (51:12 - 51:19)
well those are not trash but (51:14 - 51:21)
but i i've said this and i stand by this (51:19 - 51:24)
i said this back (51:21 - 51:25)
you know after everything is said and (51:24 - 51:27)
done (51:25 - 51:29)
and how how mad the internet was for (51:27 - 51:30)
sword and shield specifically like the (51:29 - 51:33)
national decks the like recycled (51:30 - 51:34)
graphics even though if you look at (51:33 - 51:36)
legends all of the all of those like (51:34 - 51:38)
faces that they use in legends are (51:36 - 51:39)
literally the same faces that were (51:38 - 51:41)
programmed in sword and shield right (51:39 - 51:43)
like they made pokemon models they made (51:41 - 51:44)
character models (51:43 - 51:46)
like these things were copy and pasted (51:44 - 51:48)
throughout all the games and that's fine (51:46 - 51:49)
that's normal like animation studios do (51:48 - 51:51)
this all the time as well (51:49 - 51:53)
um (51:51 - 51:55)
like the copy and pasting of the facial (51:53 - 51:59)
animations that you see in legends is (51:55 - 52:01)
like no one brought that up right (51:59 - 52:03)
the lack of breeding in legends no one (52:01 - 52:04)
really brought that complained about i (52:03 - 52:07)
brought that up yes (52:04 - 52:08)
we can always find a handful of people (52:07 - 52:11)
but like the overall like (52:08 - 52:13)
the the general population the general (52:11 - 52:15)
what you hear about a game like (52:13 - 52:16)
and the reason i bring up reading is (52:15 - 52:18)
because that was brought up for let's go (52:16 - 52:20)
pikachu let's go eevee like people did (52:18 - 52:21)
like there's no braiding in this game (52:20 - 52:22)
like what (52:21 - 52:23)
so (52:22 - 52:26)
and no one really talked about one (52:23 - 52:28)
a lack of a national decks in this game (52:26 - 52:29)
and two that this is a very small (52:28 - 52:31)
pokedex compared to other pokemon games (52:29 - 52:33)
like these things that (52:31 - 52:35)
were complaints about let's go pikachu (52:33 - 52:37)
and let's go evie and sword and shield (52:35 - 52:39)
did not apply to this game the only (52:37 - 52:42)
thing that really stood out was (52:39 - 52:44)
wow this game looked bad graphically and (52:42 - 52:45)
it does like there are moments in the (52:44 - 52:47)
game where that's good (52:45 - 52:49)
but there are we also didn't hear those (52:47 - 52:51)
things about other games like ranger and (52:49 - 52:52)
other things where people didn't know (52:51 - 52:53)
what it was (52:52 - 52:55)
it didn't have a set formula they didn't (52:53 - 52:57)
know what to expect (52:55 - 53:00)
nobody says like oh it's a small pokedex (52:57 - 53:02)
in mystery dungeon because they don't (53:00 - 53:04)
view those in the same lens they don't (53:02 - 53:07)
say it's got 25 years of history this is (53:04 - 53:10)
what i expect arceus came in with a lot (53:07 - 53:12)
of people saying i have no idea what (53:10 - 53:16)
this is yep also have they said at all (53:12 - 53:17)
that there are any plans to connect this (53:16 - 53:19)
to pokemon home they did they did they (53:17 - 53:21)
said okay they did when they announced (53:19 - 53:22)
it that there will be pokemon home (53:21 - 53:25)
compatibility in 2022. that was it was (53:22 - 53:27)
said at the same time they said it just (53:25 - 53:29)
like they said sleep and we'll probably (53:27 - 53:31)
forget it and it will go into the (53:29 - 53:33)
dustbin okay we already talked sleep has (53:31 - 53:35)
been added to pokemon go like a month (53:33 - 53:38)
ago it will eventually come (53:35 - 53:41)
what how did i miss that did we not talk (53:38 - 53:44)
about it on the show no we didn't no oh (53:41 - 53:46)
oh my bad (53:44 - 53:48)
uh well we can that's what happens you (53:46 - 53:49)
don't share your notes with us (53:48 - 53:52)
he's got no notes come on now there was (53:49 - 53:53)
uh (53:52 - 53:54)
wait hold on can we finish the legends (53:53 - 53:57)
talk and we could go to the sleep talk (53:54 - 53:59)
i mean i can't imagine sleep top is (53:57 - 54:02)
gonna be very long but yeah go (53:59 - 54:04)
um (54:02 - 54:04)
i i don't believe that there's like a (54:05 - 54:09)
paralysis but maybe there is of somebody (54:07 - 54:11)
walking into the store thinking like i (54:09 - 54:13)
want to buy a pokemon game and going (54:11 - 54:15)
like should i get the one with the (54:13 - 54:17)
shield dog or do i get the one with the (54:15 - 54:19)
sword dog although i will say you know (54:17 - 54:21)
when i'm streaming on twitch and people (54:19 - 54:23)
come in and they're like i'm curious of (54:21 - 54:25)
what pokemon game to get which one is (54:23 - 54:26)
the better one it's like (54:25 - 54:28)
they're exactly the same (54:26 - 54:30)
shield though they're not exactly the (54:28 - 54:32)
same one has oddish and one does not (54:30 - 54:34)
yeah there's like so many reasons why (54:32 - 54:36)
shield is better but maybe that's (54:34 - 54:38)
paralysis for some people maybe they're (54:36 - 54:39)
like oh there's like 15 different (54:38 - 54:41)
pokemon i don't know which one to get (54:39 - 54:43)
but that's not like choice paralysis is (54:41 - 54:45)
real go shopping with my husband you (54:43 - 54:49)
will see what choice paralysis is (54:45 - 54:49)
do you think (54:49 - 54:55)
like in my head i i think they do one (54:52 - 54:57)
version because you do not need to trade (54:55 - 55:00)
you can get all 240 pokemon without (54:57 - 55:03)
trading anyone they did the item thing (55:00 - 55:04)
they (55:03 - 55:06)
no trade evolutions (55:04 - 55:08)
no version exclusives (55:06 - 55:10)
kind of the first time they did this for (55:08 - 55:11)
a main this is the first time they've (55:10 - 55:14)
done this for our main series game (55:11 - 55:14)
and now it's selling incredibly well (55:15 - 55:19)
they don't think it's selling incredibly (55:18 - 55:21)
well because of trade evolutions or (55:19 - 55:23)
because of version exclusives i think (55:21 - 55:25)
it's selling incredibly well because (55:23 - 55:27)
they've they found a great formula that (55:25 - 55:28)
worked (55:27 - 55:31)
and i think that (55:28 - 55:32)
let's go (55:31 - 55:34)
and sort and shield also had really good (55:32 - 55:37)
openings to their game too and had like (55:34 - 55:39)
once people played them (55:37 - 55:40)
they enjoyed it (55:39 - 55:42)
like there were some people that were (55:40 - 55:44)
very against motion control for let's go (55:42 - 55:45)
or some people that were very burnt out (55:44 - 55:47)
for kanto but i think the people who (55:45 - 55:49)
were not burnt out for kanto and could (55:47 - 55:50)
get over the motion control was like (55:49 - 55:53)
this is a very delightful game (55:50 - 55:55)
and i mean i'm both of those and i still (55:53 - 55:57)
liked the game and then for sword and (55:55 - 55:58)
shield (55:57 - 56:00)
once people got over the fact that (55:58 - 56:03)
okay not all the pokemon are in and the (56:00 - 56:05)
game is uh (56:03 - 56:07)
the story's not that great (56:05 - 56:09)
i think the new pokemon and the (56:07 - 56:10)
multiplayer stuff that they added to (56:09 - 56:12)
talking shield (56:10 - 56:13)
was really great and convinced people to (56:12 - 56:15)
buy it and i think legends has done this (56:13 - 56:18)
well of like hey the catching pokemon is (56:15 - 56:19)
extremely fun and it's extremely (56:18 - 56:21)
addictive and the open worldness of this (56:19 - 56:24)
game is extremely great (56:21 - 56:27)
i'm curious though (56:24 - 56:30)
if legends runs out of steam (56:27 - 56:33)
sold incredibly well obviously (56:30 - 56:36)
to be the second fastest selling switch (56:33 - 56:37)
game but (56:36 - 56:40)
if they announce dlc does that pick it (56:37 - 56:42)
up do they not announce dlc and announce (56:40 - 56:46)
a second version like an ultra version (56:42 - 56:46)
we were i will say this we were (56:47 - 56:51)
surprised that there was a dlc for snap (56:49 - 56:53)
and we got a dlc for snap (56:51 - 56:56)
i i am no longer writing off (56:53 - 56:59)
them doing a dlc for a game (56:56 - 57:01)
especially one that sells really well (56:59 - 57:02)
um (57:01 - 57:04)
i do i think it needs one no do i think (57:02 - 57:06)
there'll probably be one (57:04 - 57:08)
yeah they're going to capitalize on this (57:06 - 57:11)
and bring people back i think about this (57:08 - 57:13)
is (57:11 - 57:14)
unlike (57:13 - 57:16)
snap where (57:14 - 57:18)
completing the picture duck decks just (57:16 - 57:21)
felt (57:18 - 57:21)
very much out of your control in a lot (57:21 - 57:25)
of ways like you had to know the secrets (57:23 - 57:27)
to be able to get the thing to do the (57:25 - 57:30)
thing to program it this is i can go out (57:27 - 57:32)
and collect things and i've got very (57:30 - 57:35)
specific things to do but i know where (57:32 - 57:37)
those are i know how to get to them and (57:35 - 57:39)
there's a few things that are rare but (57:37 - 57:41)
i feel much more in control of my (57:39 - 57:45)
environment than snap does (57:41 - 57:45)
i i (57:48 - 57:51)
just look at (57:50 - 57:53)
i don't disagree with what you said i i (57:51 - 57:55)
look at how many copies that sword and (57:53 - 57:59)
shield sold 25 million it's a lot (57:55 - 58:01)
like no other pokemon game has done this (57:59 - 58:03)
since gold and silver (58:01 - 58:04)
like (58:03 - 58:05)
incredible right (58:04 - 58:07)
does legends get to that point is it (58:05 - 58:09)
that good (58:07 - 58:10)
that (58:09 - 58:12)
it gets to that point because a sword (58:10 - 58:14)
and shield has a lot more things going (58:12 - 58:16)
for it right not only does it have two (58:14 - 58:18)
versions and some people are buying two (58:16 - 58:20)
versions but it has a complete and the (58:18 - 58:23)
best competitive experience ever it has (58:20 - 58:25)
greeting it has a multiplayer aspect to (58:23 - 58:28)
it of like hey dynamaxx adventure is (58:25 - 58:29)
really great you should pick up this (58:28 - 58:31)
game we should do it together um (58:29 - 58:33)
obviously like max raid battles probably (58:31 - 58:35)
fallen off because not many people are (58:33 - 58:37)
playing but like (58:35 - 58:40)
does legends get to 25 million (58:37 - 58:42)
i think one of the big contributors to (58:40 - 58:45)
sword and shield that is very hard to (58:42 - 58:49)
compare against other pokemon games is (58:45 - 58:52)
the subsequent was an add-on (58:49 - 58:55)
so it's like once ultra sun ultra moon (58:52 - 58:57)
came out if you were looking for a new (58:55 - 59:00)
pokemon game you stopped buying sun and (58:57 - 59:01)
moon yeah (59:00 - 59:03)
right so if (59:01 - 59:06)
legends arceus in this fool (59:03 - 59:09)
has an add-on then yes (59:06 - 59:11)
it will have continued because next (59:09 - 59:13)
christmas comes around there are kids (59:11 - 59:15)
out there who don't have a pokemon game (59:13 - 59:16)
and someone will say all right i'm (59:15 - 59:18)
getting you the pokemon game for (59:16 - 59:19)
christmas (59:18 - 59:21)
but if there's a new (59:19 - 59:22)
anything (59:21 - 59:25)
gen 9 or anything it will cut off the (59:22 - 59:27)
sales of pokemon legends arceus and then (59:25 - 59:29)
it'll just be the people who are looking (59:27 - 59:33)
for it that will continue to buy it (59:29 - 59:35)
i am starting to think though (59:33 - 59:38)
that legends doesn't have the legs that (59:35 - 59:42)
another pokemon game has (59:38 - 59:44)
like you can com like you you have two (59:42 - 59:46)
things in legends right off the bat (59:44 - 59:47)
right you have what arceus tells you (59:46 - 59:49)
right at the start of the game complete (59:47 - 59:51)
the pokedex define me (59:49 - 59:53)
okay cool and then you have the the (59:51 - 59:55)
story (59:53 - 59:58)
and then you get credits and i think (59:55 - 60:02)
where they run credits is a bad spot (59:58 - 60:05)
i still i still think that um and (60:02 - 60:07)
again we only know this from looking at (60:05 - 60:08)
like (60:07 - 60:10)
xbox trophies or playstation (60:08 - 60:12)
achievements (60:10 - 60:16)
and not a lot of people finish games (60:12 - 60:19)
and if you finish games (60:16 - 60:21)
you can look at like the trophies or the (60:19 - 60:23)
achievements and go oh they didn't (60:21 - 60:25)
like they literally stopped when they (60:23 - 60:26)
got credits (60:25 - 60:30)
and so we know just based off that that (60:26 - 60:33)
just gamers when they get credits unless (60:30 - 60:34)
they're hardcore unless they're really (60:33 - 60:36)
into the series which you know if you're (60:34 - 60:38)
listening to this podcast you watch (60:36 - 60:40)
twitch streams if you're obsessed with (60:38 - 60:42)
youtube pokemon content and youtube (60:40 - 60:44)
you're a hardcore fan but there are also (60:42 - 60:45)
just the fans that go in they buy a (60:44 - 60:47)
pokemon game they get credits or they (60:45 - 60:49)
buy whatever they move on in the next (60:47 - 60:50)
game (60:49 - 60:51)
um that's not that there's anything (60:50 - 60:53)
wrong with that that's that's how i am (60:51 - 60:55)
as a zelda fan like i will buy every (60:53 - 60:57)
zelda game as soon as i see credits in (60:55 - 61:00)
that game i'm done like (60:57 - 61:03)
and that's like i love zelda it's just i (61:00 - 61:05)
i don't care about collecting the quark (61:03 - 61:06)
seeds i don't care about getting every (61:05 - 61:08)
single heart piece i don't care about (61:06 - 61:11)
getting every mask and like i (61:08 - 61:14)
when i go to beat giant pig at the end (61:11 - 61:17)
of video game and i get credits i am now (61:14 - 61:20)
like closing that book if i wanted to do (61:17 - 61:22)
something before credits i would have (61:20 - 61:24)
done it like i want to do the side (61:22 - 61:26)
mission but i don't want to do it after (61:24 - 61:28)
i beat giant pig i'm i'm done with the (61:26 - 61:29)
game at that point and i think there are (61:28 - 61:31)
pokemon fans like that i'm doing (61:29 - 61:32)
everything oh there's a lot of pokemon (61:31 - 61:35)
fans like that and then when i go to (61:32 - 61:39)
uh ramen packet either dial or palkia (61:35 - 61:40)
once those credits run (61:39 - 61:43)
i'm moving on (61:40 - 61:45)
fy he means bombs (61:43 - 61:48)
yes bombs uh people get confused there (61:45 - 61:50)
are probably sorry go ahead (61:48 - 61:53)
i just think that (61:50 - 61:55)
the numbers are going to be hurt because (61:53 - 61:57)
we're not near holiday (61:55 - 61:59)
yes agreed (61:57 - 62:02)
we all have time to get get legends arcs (61:59 - 62:04)
for valentine's day we aren't here (62:02 - 62:06)
hey you know that's patrick day sales (62:04 - 62:08)
really incredibly patrick day sales i (62:06 - 62:09)
think (62:08 - 62:11)
which makes me think that there will be (62:09 - 62:14)
a dlc (62:11 - 62:16)
towards the end of the year (62:14 - 62:18)
to reinvigorate sales close to that (62:16 - 62:19)
holiday (62:18 - 62:22)
the bigger question is (62:19 - 62:24)
are they going to release something else (62:22 - 62:26)
at the end of this year (62:24 - 62:28)
and that's that is the question mark (62:26 - 62:29)
yeah (62:28 - 62:30)
and it can't be legends it's just that (62:29 - 62:32)
game has no abilities no held items it (62:30 - 62:33)
has like (62:32 - 62:35)
it can't be that i like i like how you (62:33 - 62:36)
like (62:35 - 62:38)
make that determination they have to (62:36 - 62:40)
they have to they're not if they don't (62:38 - 62:42)
they fail well they don't know they'll (62:40 - 62:43)
just keep doing sword and shield for (62:42 - 62:46)
competitive yeah they could they could i (62:43 - 62:48)
mean they could just do a minor legends (62:46 - 62:50)
update where the like 20 new legends (62:48 - 62:53)
pokemon can go and they could do that (62:50 - 62:54)
yeah because they could do a lot i mean (62:53 - 62:57)
it really somebody just have to have a (62:54 - 62:58)
plan for a legend they have to have a (62:57 - 63:00)
plan very competitive after august and (62:58 - 63:01)
they don't right now they have to have a (63:00 - 63:03)
plan (63:01 - 63:04)
they also have to be planning now (63:03 - 63:07)
because this is selling really well (63:04 - 63:08)
so (63:07 - 63:10)
it's hard to say what (63:08 - 63:12)
what they had in the hopper (63:10 - 63:16)
what this gives relief for and what what (63:12 - 63:18)
it doesn't so (63:16 - 63:20)
depending on where the anime and (63:18 - 63:21)
products are and stuff (63:20 - 63:23)
for (63:21 - 63:25)
whatever gen 9 is going to be this could (63:23 - 63:27)
be (63:25 - 63:30)
we have relief so let's do a (63:27 - 63:33)
will anderson idea of a competitive (63:30 - 63:35)
competitive specific game (63:33 - 63:37)
move competitive there for a year (63:35 - 63:41)
give us some breathing time on gen 9 do (63:37 - 63:45)
a dlc like it's hard to predict (63:41 - 63:48)
exactly what the calendar looks like (63:45 - 63:51)
uh and how much pressure they get (63:48 - 63:53)
by having this game be so successful (63:51 - 63:56)
like where does that release things (63:53 - 63:59)
if it releases things at all (63:56 - 64:02)
i do think as well as this game is (63:59 - 64:04)
selling that we will that we will see (64:02 - 64:07)
something to reinvigorate the sales (64:04 - 64:09)
for this holiday sys for this holiday (64:07 - 64:11)
season yeah for the coming holiday (64:09 - 64:13)
season sure (64:11 - 64:14)
i i just think that i i feel like (64:13 - 64:17)
legends to me has the same this is not (64:14 - 64:18)
like a bad thing (64:17 - 64:19)
um (64:18 - 64:21)
and and by no means do i think legends (64:19 - 64:22)
is a bad game i think it's incredible (64:21 - 64:24)
legends to me kind of has the same feel (64:22 - 64:28)
that pokemon snap did where (64:24 - 64:30)
you can go through it you can have an (64:28 - 64:32)
incredibly great time you can get to (64:30 - 64:34)
credits and you can feel like you're (64:32 - 64:36)
you're 60 was well spent (64:34 - 64:37)
and (64:36 - 64:40)
you kind of have to be a pretty hardcore (64:37 - 64:41)
fan (64:40 - 64:44)
to want to go and find (64:41 - 64:46)
the rest of the pokemon in that pokemon (64:44 - 64:49)
snapdex and then you have to be an even (64:46 - 64:52)
more of a hardcore fan to be like i want (64:49 - 64:54)
to try to get every picture and then you (64:52 - 64:57)
have to be an even more more more more (64:54 - 64:58)
and more of a hardcore fan to be like i (64:57 - 65:00)
want to four star (64:58 - 65:02)
all of these pictures and i feel like (65:00 - 65:05)
legends has that same feel like you go (65:02 - 65:07)
through you can have a great time you (65:05 - 65:09)
see credits now you have to be like a (65:07 - 65:10)
kind of a hardcore fan to complete your (65:09 - 65:12)
pokedex but you have a reason to put (65:10 - 65:14)
your pokedex for legends (65:12 - 65:16)
i disagree in a little bit in the fact (65:14 - 65:17)
that (65:16 - 65:20)
shortly after credits (65:17 - 65:24)
you get introduced to another (65:20 - 65:25)
quest line (65:24 - 65:28)
really quick there's not a lot of space (65:25 - 65:30)
between when credits end and somebody (65:28 - 65:32)
comes to you and say hey there's a lot (65:30 - 65:34)
more to do (65:32 - 65:35)
um (65:34 - 65:37)
and i think (65:35 - 65:40)
much like a lot of (65:37 - 65:41)
like (65:40 - 65:43)
make quote-unquote main series games (65:41 - 65:44)
where (65:43 - 65:46)
there's a gap between people telling you (65:44 - 65:48)
where to go next i don't i think lunges (65:46 - 65:51)
is smart and says hey there's there's (65:48 - 65:53)
a lot more to do this person's right (65:51 - 65:56)
here telling you let's go do this and i (65:53 - 65:57)
think it's easier to get drawn into the (65:56 - 65:59)
post game in this (65:57 - 66:01)
series than it is in other things (65:59 - 66:02)
yeah (66:01 - 66:05)
but you could (66:02 - 66:07)
but i think the thing they're asking you (66:05 - 66:10)
is still a big ask and and (66:07 - 66:12)
like completing a pokedex even though (66:10 - 66:14)
it's 240 is a big ask (66:12 - 66:15)
and (66:14 - 66:18)
well the way this poke pokedex goes yeah (66:15 - 66:21)
yeah it is but but the way to fill the (66:18 - 66:22)
pokedex (66:21 - 66:24)
is much more enjoyable and much yeah (66:22 - 66:26)
like it is genuinely fun to go out there (66:24 - 66:28)
and catch so like yeah the loop they (66:26 - 66:31)
created is incredibly addictive so they (66:28 - 66:33)
have that going for them but the loop (66:31 - 66:35)
they created in snap to get all the (66:33 - 66:38)
things to show up is not always fun yes (66:35 - 66:40)
like maybe i'm just that i'm like (66:38 - 66:42)
nah dawg (66:40 - 66:44)
maybe i'm just bad at pokemon (66:42 - 66:45)
but you know it's game's been out for (66:44 - 66:47)
over two weeks and i have not (66:45 - 66:49)
attend (66:47 - 66:52)
like get 10 to everything yet i haven't (66:49 - 66:53)
seen all the pokemon like i haven't seen (66:52 - 66:55)
landorus oh what's the rush dude that's (66:53 - 66:59)
not a rush but like (66:55 - 66:59)
it's not a rush it's just still asking a (67:00 - 67:05)
player to do a lot (67:02 - 67:07)
for for a player to enjoy the game for (67:05 - 67:09)
an extended period of time to get the (67:07 - 67:11)
value for the dollar they spent yes yeah (67:09 - 67:14)
but let's let's say (67:11 - 67:16)
i i think i mean i i still think if you (67:14 - 67:18)
don't complete your pokedex and you go (67:16 - 67:19)
through the game i still think it's (67:18 - 67:20)
worth 60 bucks i still think oh (67:19 - 67:21)
absolutely (67:20 - 67:22)
um (67:21 - 67:24)
so (67:22 - 67:27)
if you complete your pokedex (67:24 - 67:30)
if you if even if you got 10 to (67:27 - 67:31)
everything your the next step is to like (67:30 - 67:34)
perfect it which (67:31 - 67:36)
is a lot to ask i keep saying a lot to (67:34 - 67:38)
ask but it is a lot to ask (67:36 - 67:40)
like what else do you do at that point (67:38 - 67:42)
if you perfected your decks (67:40 - 67:44)
your the the default answer is like well (67:42 - 67:46)
just shiny hunt okay well (67:44 - 67:48)
yeah but not everyone's super into shiny (67:46 - 67:50)
hunting and (67:48 - 67:51)
in sword and shield you could be like (67:50 - 67:53)
well just shiny huh well yeah but if i (67:51 - 67:56)
don't like shiny hunting i can go to the (67:53 - 67:58)
battle tower or the other great thing (67:56 - 67:59)
that i think people are forgetting with (67:58 - 68:02)
sword and shield is i can do max raid (67:59 - 68:04)
battles with friends i can do dynamics (68:02 - 68:06)
adventure with friends (68:04 - 68:08)
i can (68:06 - 68:10)
um (68:08 - 68:12)
i and they had events like they had an (68:10 - 68:14)
event once a month like hey it's wailord (68:12 - 68:16)
this month hey it's clefable this month (68:14 - 68:18)
there's there's a reason to come back to (68:16 - 68:20)
that legends has (68:18 - 68:22)
none of that it has (68:20 - 68:24)
it just doesn't (68:22 - 68:25)
and so like what does this game look (68:24 - 68:26)
like in two months what does it look (68:25 - 68:29)
like in three months it has none of it (68:26 - 68:31)
now (68:29 - 68:31)
but also it's been two weeks like not (68:32 - 68:37)
every game has to have long legs some (68:34 - 68:40)
games yeah i mean snapped (68:37 - 68:40)
that's okay yeah they could easily say (68:41 - 68:45)
that this is this is all you're getting (68:43 - 68:47)
i i don't think they will because of the (68:45 - 68:49)
sales numbers (68:47 - 68:50)
but (68:49 - 68:53)
i i do think it's okay if people walk (68:50 - 68:55)
away and then something draws them back (68:53 - 68:56)
and be like this is a cool event because (68:55 - 68:58)
a lot of people walked away from sword (68:56 - 69:00)
and shield and came back when other (68:58 - 69:02)
things happened some of them never came (69:00 - 69:04)
back till the dlc happened and that was (69:02 - 69:07)
a huge chunk of time and sword shield (69:04 - 69:08)
got a big (69:07 - 69:12)
got huge legs and then for (69:08 - 69:14)
that holiday season it was like buy this (69:12 - 69:17)
and all the expansions in one and like (69:14 - 69:19)
it was a great selling point so we could (69:17 - 69:21)
see in the summer like here's the arceus (69:19 - 69:24)
dlc and then at the holiday here's the (69:21 - 69:27)
bundled game the dlc and the main game (69:24 - 69:28)
together like (69:27 - 69:31)
these are all possibilities it is really (69:28 - 69:34)
hard to predict (69:31 - 69:35)
i think we all knew what would happen if (69:34 - 69:37)
the game sold poorly it'd be a (69:35 - 69:38)
one-and-done now that the game is (69:37 - 69:40)
selling really well it's very hard to (69:38 - 69:42)
predict how they're going to capitalize (69:40 - 69:44)
on that yeah i'm i mean i'm glad it's (69:42 - 69:45)
selling well it's (69:44 - 69:47)
it's one of the best pokemon experiences (69:45 - 69:49)
out there (69:47 - 69:51)
i just i just don't think it's one of (69:49 - 69:53)
the fullest pokemon experiences out (69:51 - 69:54)
there no (69:53 - 69:56)
but i don't think it doesn't have to be (69:54 - 69:58)
that yeah (69:56 - 69:59)
i think people went in with the (69:58 - 70:03)
expectation that this was going to be (69:59 - 70:06)
like a ranger or a mystery dungeon like (70:03 - 70:08)
it's going to be its own unique thing (70:06 - 70:10)
it's going to have its own unique feel (70:08 - 70:12)
to it and people didn't (70:10 - 70:13)
put (70:12 - 70:14)
as much (70:13 - 70:17)
expectational weight on this game as (70:14 - 70:19)
they did on like sword and [ __ ] well i (70:17 - 70:20)
know somebody who went into it saying (70:19 - 70:23)
well this is going to be like let's go (70:20 - 70:26)
pikachu let's go eevee it's a small (70:23 - 70:28)
experience and you're done and you're (70:26 - 70:29)
done and (70:28 - 70:32)
it's a bit bigger than yeah (70:29 - 70:34)
let's go eevee it is a bit bigger but (70:32 - 70:36)
it's not people have been wrong in the (70:34 - 70:38)
past yeah not me (70:36 - 70:41)
yes you have hey the uh the update (70:38 - 70:42)
just (70:41 - 70:44)
the main thing that the update did was (70:42 - 70:47)
it fixed cherum (70:44 - 70:49)
i haven't seen a cherum yet well (70:47 - 70:51)
cherum is (70:49 - 70:52)
very rare (70:51 - 70:54)
so there was a bug with cherum when if (70:52 - 70:57)
cherum popped out of a tree and cherum (70:54 - 70:59)
has two forms it has like depressed form (70:57 - 71:02)
and then like sunshine form emo form emo (70:59 - 71:06)
form and happens therapy form yes if (71:02 - 71:11)
if cherum transformed during your battle (71:06 - 71:13)
its catch rate became zero it became (71:11 - 71:16)
impossible to catch when it transferred (71:13 - 71:17)
nice (71:16 - 71:20)
so they they patched that they fixed (71:17 - 71:21)
that (71:20 - 71:23)
um there was like some other bug fixes (71:21 - 71:25)
that they didn't like specifically say (71:23 - 71:26)
so that was the main thing they fixed in (71:25 - 71:28)
this update the other minor thing that (71:26 - 71:29)
they fixed but they didn't actually tell (71:28 - 71:32)
anyone about is when a distortion pops (71:29 - 71:34)
up on the map (71:32 - 71:36)
there's like a small white circle that (71:34 - 71:38)
appears and you can actually see it (71:36 - 71:41)
count down so you can see how much time (71:38 - 71:44)
the distortion they added that but it (71:41 - 71:46)
wasn't in the patch notes (71:44 - 71:49)
um and it's like helpful it's just very (71:46 - 71:51)
hard to see (71:49 - 71:53)
um you have to zoom into the map all the (71:51 - 71:55)
way and even then it's like (71:53 - 71:58)
not really clear but it's there if you (71:55 - 71:59)
want to see how much time is left on the (71:58 - 72:00)
distortion (71:59 - 72:02)
if you can find a distortion did they (72:00 - 72:05)
change how pokemon go into pastors or am (72:02 - 72:07)
i just not paying enough attention go (72:05 - 72:09)
into pastures yeah because he's always (72:07 - 72:11)
going to first box but some are showing (72:09 - 72:14)
up in way later boxes after i've caught (72:11 - 72:15)
them (72:14 - 72:16)
really (72:15 - 72:17)
yeah (72:16 - 72:18)
i don't know if that's just me not (72:17 - 72:20)
paying enough attention and i'm making (72:18 - 72:21)
that up (72:20 - 72:23)
um but there's there's been a number of (72:21 - 72:24)
times i'm like oh it's going to be in (72:23 - 72:26)
the first few and i'm like no it's not (72:24 - 72:29)
it's where i stopped looking at like 16. (72:26 - 72:32)
and i don't know if that's just me (72:29 - 72:34)
it could be i haven't moved any around (72:32 - 72:37)
so mine always just append at the end (72:34 - 72:39)
yeah that was the next i haven't noticed (72:37 - 72:40)
that well uh other people had your (72:39 - 72:42)
wormful problem there's tons of other (72:40 - 72:43)
people that their wormpole has not (72:42 - 72:47)
evolved either okay okay okay i am six (72:43 - 72:49)
star now congratulations to me because (72:47 - 72:51)
that's a lot of work (72:49 - 72:55)
and i just got on the blackboard a quest (72:51 - 72:56)
saying (72:55 - 73:00)
cascoon or whatever is evolving (72:56 - 73:02)
check the evolution go talk to beaujean (73:00 - 73:04)
did you (73:02 - 73:06)
did you have both a cast [ __ ] and the (73:04 - 73:08)
silicon registered in your decks is that (73:06 - 73:10)
i had not had hadn't caught any so i (73:08 - 73:12)
think i think that may be it because i (73:10 - 73:14)
did catch it i caught a cascoon this (73:12 - 73:16)
morning and then that's when it popped (73:14 - 73:17)
and it popped up yeah there was a bunch (73:16 - 73:18)
of people after the episode that was (73:17 - 73:21)
like certain people didn't make me rush (73:18 - 73:22)
through the game and i could have (73:21 - 73:25)
casually wanted to be you wanted to be (73:22 - 73:26)
on (73:25 - 73:29)
oh that's debatable (73:26 - 73:31)
you wanted to be a part of this (73:29 - 73:34)
experience (73:31 - 73:34)
hey uh will you talk about um (73:35 - 73:40)
i wanna i wanna do the last 30 minutes (73:38 - 73:42)
for for twitch chat and questions like (73:40 - 73:44)
that so uh before we take our final (73:42 - 73:45)
break (73:44 - 73:47)
um (73:45 - 73:48)
the (73:47 - 73:50)
data miners for pogo they're the ones (73:48 - 73:52)
that are like oh new stickers are being (73:50 - 73:55)
added oh like flabebe floette is like (73:52 - 73:58)
the new pokemon for valentine's day like (73:55 - 74:00)
niantic or most most game developers (73:58 - 74:02)
will have to push like a seed early (74:00 - 74:04)
because it needs to be approved by apple (74:02 - 74:06)
and google and then once it's approved (74:04 - 74:09)
then they can like unlock it um and once (74:06 - 74:11)
that seed is sent out seed being like (74:09 - 74:14)
the next (74:11 - 74:15)
for people who don't know i know you (74:14 - 74:16)
guys know (74:15 - 74:17)
um (74:16 - 74:20)
the data miners figure it all out so (74:17 - 74:22)
over a month ago (74:20 - 74:23)
it was like (74:22 - 74:24)
yeah i think i think it was the (74:23 - 74:26)
beginning of january (74:24 - 74:28)
there was an update that was pushed that (74:26 - 74:29)
had (74:28 - 74:32)
data for pokemon sleep specifically (74:29 - 74:36)
the um the plus plus you guys remember (74:32 - 74:37)
the (74:36 - 74:40)
so there's the there's the go plus which (74:37 - 74:41)
there's the (74:40 - 74:43)
pokemon go plus which is like the little (74:41 - 74:46)
like pokeball with the button that you (74:43 - 74:46)
press (74:46 - 74:48)
and then when let's go pikachu let's go (74:46 - 74:51)
eevee came out they gave the pokeball (74:48 - 74:52)
plus (74:51 - 74:54)
yes which is (74:52 - 74:55)
autos the only difference between the (74:54 - 74:58)
pokeball plus and the pokemon the (74:55 - 75:00)
pokemon go (74:58 - 75:01)
plus (75:00 - 75:02)
yes (75:01 - 75:05)
is that the pokeball (75:02 - 75:08)
could auto spin stops if there was a (75:05 - 75:10)
pokemon inside (75:08 - 75:12)
and if there was a pokemon inside if you (75:10 - 75:14)
synced it with (75:12 - 75:17)
pokemon let's go pikachu let's go eevee (75:14 - 75:19)
you would get like nuggets and candy and (75:17 - 75:21)
that kind of stuff that works in shield (75:19 - 75:22)
too (75:21 - 75:23)
yeah (75:22 - 75:24)
um (75:23 - 75:27)
so you would get stuff for walking (75:24 - 75:30)
but when you're like so this is this is (75:27 - 75:32)
my problem as a hardcore pokemon go (75:30 - 75:34)
player is you got phone in one hand you (75:32 - 75:36)
got pokeball plus in the other hand (75:34 - 75:39)
and if you want a coffee (75:36 - 75:41)
i don't have a third hand for that and (75:39 - 75:43)
so it's like really hard to like hold (75:41 - 75:44)
both (75:43 - 75:46)
right and then that's why you get a coin (75:44 - 75:48)
and a strap (75:46 - 75:50)
put it around the pokeball plus so the (75:48 - 75:52)
button is always pressed but i still (75:50 - 75:53)
want to look at you (75:52 - 75:54)
right like i still want to look at the (75:53 - 75:56)
screen but then you've got coffee (75:54 - 75:58)
because your your pokeball plus is (75:56 - 76:00)
strapped up and hanging to your belt you (75:58 - 76:02)
hold the coffee and your phone then (76:00 - 76:03)
that's auto catching and it might auto (76:02 - 76:07)
catch and fail shiny give yourself a 15 (76:03 - 76:10)
minute break to enjoy (76:07 - 76:11)
your coffee (76:10 - 76:14)
free of distraction look community day (76:11 - 76:16)
doesn't give me a 15 minute break so it (76:14 - 76:18)
does it's 17 (76:16 - 76:21)
days long but wait also we stopped at (76:18 - 76:24)
eight at b-dubs in the middle of you can (76:21 - 76:27)
drink coffee in five minutes (76:24 - 76:28)
i (76:27 - 76:30)
i only i mean i come to the closest (76:28 - 76:31)
thing of auto catch because i just hold (76:30 - 76:33)
the ball in my hand i never look at my (76:31 - 76:35)
phone and i press like it gives me a (76:33 - 76:37)
little vibrate i press (76:35 - 76:39)
i still walked away with what twelve (76:37 - 76:43)
shinies yesterday what is this fear of (76:39 - 76:45)
auto catch missing a shiny okay for a (76:43 - 76:46)
community it's like not that big of a (76:45 - 76:48)
deal right because it's just the way (76:46 - 76:50)
chinese are free they are useless and (76:48 - 76:52)
worthless now so yeah yeah (76:50 - 76:54)
they're not worth anything yes the value (76:52 - 76:56)
of shiny is way down all-time low um but (76:54 - 77:00)
on like a johto tour right you you want (76:56 - 77:01)
to check (77:00 - 77:03)
those johto pokemon maybe in a specific (77:01 - 77:05)
car okay so here's the poke this is who (77:03 - 77:07)
cares about pokemon sleep no one cares (77:05 - 77:10)
about pokemon sleep we care we can i do (77:07 - 77:14)
i'm a big fan of sleep i love sleep (77:10 - 77:16)
while i'm asleep that adds eight to nine (77:14 - 77:19)
hours of pokemon playing the the poke (77:16 - 77:20)
the pokeball plus plus or whatever (77:19 - 77:22)
they're calling it the the device it (77:20 - 77:24)
looks like a puck right i have a i have (77:22 - 77:25)
an anchor charger right here i'm sorry (77:24 - 77:28)
audio listeners it and and it looks like (77:25 - 77:30)
this the pokeball plus plus there's a (77:28 - 77:32)
button on the back right but the nice (77:30 - 77:33)
thing about what this looks like (77:32 - 77:35)
hopefully they haven't changed it is (77:33 - 77:37)
it's like flat (77:35 - 77:37)

disaster right here i can't do that i (77:57 - 78:01)

i'm trying (78:01 - 78:05)
as a professional pokemon trainer i'm (78:03 - 78:07)
trying to find the right tools for the (78:05 - 78:08)

pokemon so give me the plus plus give me (78:11 - 78:16)
the flat put it in the back of my press (78:14 - 78:18)
the button (78:16 - 78:19)
i wanna (78:18 - 78:21)
at some point we need to delve into this (78:19 - 78:23)
professional part (78:21 - 78:25)
of pokemon player because i am going to (78:23 - 78:27)
argue (78:25 - 78:29)
hardcore against this (78:27 - 78:30)
premise (78:29 - 78:33)
there is only one person on this podca (78:30 - 78:36)
podcast that is google certified pokemon (78:33 - 78:39)
master (78:36 - 78:39)
oh one you took that quick (78:39 - 78:44)
because one has the business cards from (78:41 - 78:45)
google (78:44 - 78:48)
certifying me on the largest search (78:45 - 78:51)
engine and controls your life google is (78:48 - 78:54)
the only one on the show (78:51 - 78:57)
you renew your pokemon master license (78:54 - 78:58)
greg do you know how many tests i have (78:57 - 79:00)
to take every year you're like i can't (78:58 - 79:02)
take a driver's test a thing that's 16 (79:00 - 79:05)
years old the driver's license you don't (79:02 - 79:07)
even know what i have to go through (79:05 - 79:10)
remain a master with google soda native (79:07 - 79:12)
you didn't have to take the admissions (79:10 - 79:14)
exam you don't know anything about what (79:12 - 79:16)
we have to do (79:14 - 79:16)
departments (79:17 - 79:23)
are making us jump through (79:20 - 79:24)
you don't even know how close you're (79:23 - 79:26)
allowed to drive to a cyclist (79:24 - 79:29)
yes i do that's because i told you the (79:26 - 79:30)
answer yes no you didn't you made up a (79:29 - 79:33)
whole bunch of garbage yeah because if (79:30 - 79:36)
yeah if if the test is like how close (79:33 - 79:37)
are you allowed to be in a bicyclist in (79:36 - 79:40)
a car is it six feet or is it three feet (79:37 - 79:42)
and i'm thinking well kovid now exists (79:40 - 79:44)
i'm supposed to be six feet away at all (79:42 - 79:47)
times should i be six feet away from the (79:44 - 79:48)
bicycle driver because what if i'm (79:47 - 79:50)
driving a convertible greg i'm back on (79:48 - 79:52)
your side (79:50 - 79:54)
the actual answer is (79:52 - 79:56)
but when i'm at the checkout in target (79:54 - 79:58)
it's supposed to be six feet (79:56 - 80:01)
it is negative three outside you are not (79:58 - 80:03)
driving a convertible a negative three (80:01 - 80:05)
and worrying about a person who is (80:03 - 80:08)
literally covered head to toe in 18 (80:05 - 80:09)
masks and a scarf (80:08 - 80:12)
on a bike so that they can perhaps not (80:09 - 80:14)
freeze to death on their way home (80:12 - 80:15)
whether or not you're going to give them (80:14 - 80:18)
covet we have bigger outdoor worries (80:15 - 80:20)

been a ride (80:54 - 80:57)
i wanted to make sure we got the normal (80:55 - 80:58)
you know i listened to a lot of podcasts (80:57 - 81:00)
myself and i was like how do they do (80:58 - 81:01)
their anniversary episodes and it's just (81:00 - 81:04)
like normally it's just a normal episode (81:01 - 81:06)
not everyone some of them are like this (81:04 - 81:08)
is a bonanza yeah answering me this (81:06 - 81:11)
usually did like a bunch of guest people (81:08 - 81:13)
would come and answer questions they had (81:11 - 81:15)
like famous celebrities (81:13 - 81:18)
so uh we are doing this live on twitch (81:15 - 81:19)
if uh if you're listening to the audio (81:18 - 81:22)
version or you're watching on youtube um (81:19 - 81:24)
thank you for still listening if you're (81:22 - 81:26)
if you're here in the moment on twitch (81:24 - 81:28)
we will be taking questions from twitch (81:26 - 81:29)
chat (81:28 - 81:31)
and we will be answering those because (81:29 - 81:32)
so it's kind of like an email show (81:31 - 81:35)
except more live more interactive um (81:32 - 81:37)
shout out to the people that are here (81:35 - 81:38)
uh so (81:37 - 81:40)
we can't get to every question trying to (81:38 - 81:43)
keep this to like 30 minutes (81:40 - 81:44)
yeah good luck (81:43 - 81:46)
uh we've never captured the 30 minutes (81:44 - 81:48)
in our lives (81:46 - 81:49)
uh (81:48 - 81:50)
yeah you know (81:49 - 81:52)
well if will didn't talk so much we (81:50 - 81:55)
would be out of here (81:52 - 81:55)
uh seriously kind of questions are fair (81:55 - 81:59)
game uh pretty much anything uh pokemon (81:57 - 82:02)
related uh you know same as emails you (81:59 - 82:03)
know not all the email questions we take (82:02 - 82:05)
are pokemon related but (82:03 - 82:06)
true (82:05 - 82:08)
i mean i'm sure the mods will erase any (82:06 - 82:11)
questions that are not appropriate (82:08 - 82:12)
did you coordinate your shirts today (82:11 - 82:14)
everyone's wearing blue no not (82:12 - 82:16)
coordinated (82:14 - 82:16)
absolutely not (82:17 - 82:22)
i mean (82:20 - 82:24)
there's only so many colors that you (82:22 - 82:26)
made shirts in (82:24 - 82:29)
and i was not gonna not wear (82:26 - 82:30)
one of those shirts from the archive (82:29 - 82:32)
although i will say i almost wore the (82:30 - 82:34)
mod hoodie just because i knew we would (82:32 - 82:36)
be here but the thought of putting on a (82:34 - 82:40)
hoodie was an absolute no-go (82:36 - 82:40)
uh this is a good question this is from (82:40 - 82:44)
prime in chat how did you all meet i (82:42 - 82:47)
feel like i've always told my side of (82:44 - 82:48)
the story but i don't think i've ever (82:47 - 82:50)
heard your guys's side of the story (82:48 - 82:52)
besides like you guys both listen to the (82:50 - 82:54)
podcast and then reach out (82:52 - 82:56)
have we ever met (82:54 - 83:00)
that's like some presumption right there (82:56 - 83:02)
uh i mean i i came in later will do you (83:00 - 83:05)
want to start because you were first uh (83:02 - 83:07)
so it was in (83:05 - 83:10)
february of 2012 or actually i think it (83:07 - 83:13)
was january 2012 but it started in (83:10 - 83:15)
around february of 2012. (83:13 - 83:16)
um (83:15 - 83:19)
when the the actual website for the (83:16 - 83:22)
program was something with articles and (83:19 - 83:23)
updates (83:22 - 83:25)
uh steve was looking for people to write (83:23 - 83:27)
articles for the website and i (83:25 - 83:29)
volunteered to start doing a weekly (83:27 - 83:31)
pokemon of the week (83:29 - 83:32)
column (83:31 - 83:35)
uh the first one i did (83:32 - 83:35)
i (83:35 - 83:38)
pretty sure was actually on (83:35 - 83:42)
february 14th and i did toe to dial (83:38 - 83:43)
but then (83:42 - 83:45)
uh so i did that for a few months and (83:43 - 83:47)
then u.s nationals came up (83:45 - 83:50)
it was july because u.s nationals was (83:47 - 83:52)
used to always be in july (83:50 - 83:56)
uh of 2012 and i decided to drive out to (83:52 - 83:59)
indianapolis to meet up with everybody (83:56 - 84:00)
and (83:59 - 84:03)
i showed up halfway through the day and (84:00 - 84:05)
steve and vinnie were playing a tcg (84:03 - 84:07)
match and i walked up and started (84:05 - 84:09)
looking at them and (84:07 - 84:11)
nobody realized it was me oh no no i'm (84:09 - 84:13)
sorry irene caught me in the hall (84:11 - 84:15)
because i like texted her and then she (84:13 - 84:16)
ran over and gave me a hug because (84:15 - 84:19)
that's irene's mode (84:16 - 84:21)
and then i went in and then i didn't i (84:19 - 84:23)
didn't interrupt the tcg game and then i (84:21 - 84:25)
said hello (84:23 - 84:26)
uh (84:25 - 84:28)
i remember vinnie but i've never met (84:26 - 84:30)
whitney (84:28 - 84:32)
well no because you never went to a (84:30 - 84:33)
regionals or nationals right i've never (84:32 - 84:35)
been to the original world (84:33 - 84:37)
um (84:35 - 84:39)
okay so steve refused to come to my (84:37 - 84:41)
wedding that's true (84:39 - 84:43)
so here's how it started wow i was a (84:41 - 84:45)
long time listener and then you had (84:43 - 84:46)
started (84:45 - 84:49)
uh the tuesday night games podcast and (84:46 - 84:51)
you're all like i need to learn how to (84:49 - 84:52)
play d and i was like look all right (84:51 - 84:55)
look i am ideal to introduce you to d d (84:52 - 84:57)
because i've always wanted to do a (84:55 - 85:00)
pokemon d d thing (84:57 - 85:02)
together so we started talking more (85:00 - 85:04)
regularly and then irene on twitter was (85:02 - 85:05)
like i want to come to your wedding and (85:04 - 85:06)
i'm like okay we've never met but i (85:05 - 85:08)
guess (85:06 - 85:10)
if you've come to a wedding where you (85:08 - 85:11)
will literally know (85:10 - 85:12)
nobody (85:11 - 85:15)
and meet me for the very first time (85:12 - 85:17)
whatever here's an invite and then you (85:15 - 85:18)
refuse to show up which is fine because (85:17 - 85:20)
it would have been weird standard (85:18 - 85:22)
uh and then (85:20 - 85:24)
after you humming and hawing and being (85:22 - 85:25)
like (85:24 - 85:27)
now with that where blah blah i finally (85:25 - 85:28)
got you to play d d and you're like well (85:27 - 85:31)
we're gonna record it so i said fine so (85:28 - 85:33)
then we started doing mythical and that (85:31 - 85:35)
was in 2015 (85:33 - 85:38)
end of 2015 beginning of 2016. (85:35 - 85:41)
and then (85:38 - 85:41)
it was like oh we got a gen con let's (85:42 - 85:47)
all meet at gen con (85:44 - 85:49)
to record mythical stuff and then we can (85:47 - 85:51)
finally meet in person and i'd never (85:49 - 85:55)
been to gen con i was like uh i guess so (85:51 - 85:57)
i drove by myself (85:55 - 85:59)
to gen con (85:57 - 86:01)
uh to meet you all and that was the (85:59 - 86:03)
first time and i met (86:01 - 86:04)
everybody (86:03 - 86:05)
yeah (86:04 - 86:07)
at the pokemon merchandise booth that (86:05 - 86:10)
first day as you remember that (86:07 - 86:12)
but you also you were you had like one (86:10 - 86:14)
of the premium because when before we (86:12 - 86:17)
even did patreon like the first ever (86:14 - 86:19)
time the show made money was we did a (86:17 - 86:21)
kickstarter because yeah i did the (86:19 - 86:23)
kickstarter like patreon was i think (86:21 - 86:26)
patreon was a thing but like it was (86:23 - 86:28)
still so new that people weren't really (86:26 - 86:30)
like using it (86:28 - 86:32)
and then i saw (86:30 - 86:34)
170. i saw a lot of podcasts would go on (86:32 - 86:35)
kickstarter and they would be like we (86:34 - 86:37)
want to do a whole year we want like 2 (86:35 - 86:39)
000 to do the year and you get your name (86:37 - 86:41)
in the credits you do all that stuff so (86:39 - 86:43)
that was the first time and (86:41 - 86:45)
the show was the show was around for (86:43 - 86:46)
five or six years that was the first (86:45 - 86:48)
time the show ever made money was we did (86:46 - 86:49)
a kickstarter we raised a bunch of money (86:48 - 86:52)
one of the like the premium tiers was i (86:49 - 86:53)
think it was like 100 bucks and you (86:52 - 86:55)
would be on an episode it was like (86:53 - 86:57)
limited to like 10 people and i think (86:55 - 86:59)
greg did that (86:57 - 87:01)
i did i did that because i actually hit (86:59 - 87:03)
right after the kickstarter hit right (87:01 - 87:05)
after i got a work bonus (87:03 - 87:07)
um (87:05 - 87:09)
well i'm like well sure i'll go on a (87:07 - 87:11)
show and (87:09 - 87:13)
i'll show everybody what a guest is like (87:11 - 87:14)
that talks too much (87:13 - 87:16)
because most people are like humming and (87:14 - 87:17)
hugging and don't know what it is some (87:16 - 87:19)
of those folks we were dragging words (87:17 - 87:22)
out of them i got that right i have been (87:19 - 87:24)
screaming at you in my car for about (87:22 - 87:26)
five years now and i'm gonna scream at (87:24 - 87:29)
you live this is my moment i'm paying a (87:26 - 87:30)
hundred dollars and i gotta make it (87:29 - 87:31)
count (87:30 - 87:33)
that was that was always like those were (87:31 - 87:34)
those episodes were always fun but like (87:33 - 87:36)
some people would be like so excited to (87:34 - 87:37)
be on and then once they would be on (87:36 - 87:39)
they would like freeze up and be very (87:37 - 87:41)
nervous and not say a lot which is like (87:39 - 87:43)
i mean i was a (87:41 - 87:45)
i i was an actor so i was like this is (87:43 - 87:46)
nothing (87:45 - 87:48)
you just get to talk to people that i'm (87:46 - 87:52)
friendly with i'm in (87:48 - 87:52)
um (87:52 - 87:56)
okay chat was moving really fast there (87:54 - 87:57)
was a lot of questions (87:56 - 87:59)
uh if you (87:57 - 88:01)
okay so this was uh this is from bear in (87:59 - 88:03)
chat if you could bring one pokemon if (88:01 - 88:05)
you could bring one of the new pokemon (88:03 - 88:06)
from legends into the current (88:05 - 88:09)
competitive which would it be (88:06 - 88:12)
i mean apathy mostly but uh (88:09 - 88:14)
overquill (88:12 - 88:17)
i think overquill is a lot of fun (88:14 - 88:17)
i don't do competitive (88:21 - 88:24)
so it's kind of hard for me to think (88:23 - 88:27)
about it what i do here's the thing i (88:24 - 88:30)
really really really like typhlosion (88:27 - 88:32)
yeah (88:30 - 88:34)
and i want that to come forward i really (88:32 - 88:36)
like this version of type lotion a lot (88:34 - 88:38)
and i i (88:36 - 88:40)
i know it's like a common-ish type (88:38 - 88:42)
but i love his design and i'm not much a (88:40 - 88:44)
competitor so like (88:42 - 88:47)
i i really like cyndaquil is my (88:44 - 88:49)
favorite gen 2 starter (88:47 - 88:51)
so (88:49 - 88:54)
like sold on the whole thing so i i have (88:51 - 88:56)
a question because i've been trying to (88:54 - 88:58)
think this through chandelure was the (88:56 - 89:01)
first ghost fire right fire ghost (88:58 - 89:03)
ghostfire whichever way it goes yeah (89:01 - 89:04)
okay (89:03 - 89:06)
and then (89:04 - 89:07)
like we waited a while (89:06 - 89:11)
and we got alolan marowak (89:07 - 89:14)
yeah i love alolan miralex okay and then (89:11 - 89:15)
i was like oh okay so the new (89:14 - 89:18)
typhlosions the new ghost fire i was (89:15 - 89:20)
like i've got half a team but i forgot (89:18 - 89:21)
about (89:20 - 89:23)
blacephalon (89:21 - 89:25)
yeah i've got four out of six yeah (89:23 - 89:28)
you're almost there i i cuz if i could (89:25 - 89:31)
do an entire ghost fire team i'm down (89:28 - 89:33)
there (89:31 - 89:35)
i would want to say ursuluna because i (89:33 - 89:37)
think out of all the new pokemon i think (89:35 - 89:40)
ursulina is like my favorite (89:37 - 89:42)
uh isn't it just normal though it's (89:40 - 89:44)
normal ground (89:42 - 89:46)
oh (89:44 - 89:46)
but i would probably say the one that (89:47 - 89:51)
would maybe have the most impact i don't (89:49 - 89:53)
know i didn't i have i'm sure like these (89:51 - 89:55)
high-end competitive players they (89:53 - 89:56)
probably made videos about like which (89:55 - 89:59)
pokemon would do well in my head i would (89:56 - 90:00)
think that (89:59 - 90:02)
sui and zoroark would do really well (90:00 - 90:04)
oh yeah normally (90:02 - 90:06)
or it can't get (90:04 - 90:07)
um fighting moves it can't get hit by (90:06 - 90:10)
ghost moves (90:07 - 90:11)
no it can get hit by ghost moves it (90:10 - 90:13)
takes extra damage from ghosts you can't (90:11 - 90:14)
get hit by normal moves because it's (90:13 - 90:16)
it's just plain ghost it's not it's (90:14 - 90:19)
normal it's no it's normal ghost oh geez (90:16 - 90:23)
so he can't get hit by notice that yeah (90:19 - 90:25)
yeah (90:23 - 90:27)
it gets wrecked by dark (90:25 - 90:29)
it does get really wrecked by dark yes (90:27 - 90:32)
uh this is from cappy if uh is pokemon (90:29 - 90:34)
each of your favorite franchises if not (90:32 - 90:37)
uh what is it if so what is your second (90:34 - 90:39)
favorite franchise (90:37 - 90:42)
wow so many branching (90:39 - 90:44)
possibilities uh (90:42 - 90:45)
star wars is my number one franchise (90:44 - 90:49)
always has been always will be (90:45 - 90:52)
pokemon is number two (90:49 - 90:54)
maybe what if you restricted it to video (90:52 - 90:56)
games only (90:54 - 90:58)
uh oh video games only (90:56 - 90:59)
uh (90:58 - 91:01)
make star wars video games (90:59 - 91:03)
yeah but greg doesn't play those (91:01 - 91:06)
um so if it's if we go video games only (91:03 - 91:09)
then pokemon's my top video game (91:06 - 91:10)
and then final fantasy is the one right (91:09 - 91:13)
below it (91:10 - 91:13)
what what is it for you steve (91:15 - 91:21)
um i would probably say pokemon number (91:18 - 91:24)
one franchise and i would maybe say (91:21 - 91:27)
monster hunter number two at this point (91:24 - 91:29)
see i'm having a heart really high but (91:27 - 91:30)
man (91:29 - 91:31)
fell for me (91:30 - 91:33)
well sony bought them so they may be (91:31 - 91:35)
coming back that's uh that's a (91:33 - 91:36)
discussion i've been having recently (91:35 - 91:38)
with not you people (91:36 - 91:40)
um (91:38 - 91:42)
you people oh you're bringing it back i (91:40 - 91:44)
mean the people i talk about serious (91:42 - 91:46)
video game stuff with not (91:44 - 91:47)
not y'all (91:46 - 91:49)
hosers um (91:47 - 91:51)
let's see and that's tough for me (91:49 - 91:54)
right because (91:51 - 91:57)
i i'm almost the flip of that (91:54 - 92:00)
because i will play (91:57 - 92:01)
months i will make it a point to play (92:00 - 92:04)
monster hunter every single day (92:01 - 92:05)
i will get to a point in any pokemon (92:04 - 92:08)
game where i'm like you know what (92:05 - 92:10)
i i've i've done everything i want to do (92:08 - 92:13)
with this pokemon game and i'm i'm done (92:10 - 92:16)
i'll walk away (92:13 - 92:16)
so i think i might just say monster (92:16 - 92:20)
hunter has to be number one and then (92:18 - 92:24)
pokemon is number two um (92:20 - 92:24)
uh i see people were like what about (92:24 - 92:28)
animal crossing nah animal crossing will (92:26 - 92:29)
never be it i don't think that's (92:28 - 92:30)
probably for me (92:29 - 92:33)
asks way too much for me on a daily (92:30 - 92:36)
basis for me to like that game long term (92:33 - 92:38)
and some of those animals will never be (92:36 - 92:41)
happy and like then leave just get out (92:38 - 92:42)
and the ones that i want to say that i (92:41 - 92:44)
do literally everything to make them (92:42 - 92:46)
happy is like it's been so great here (92:44 - 92:48)
but like (92:46 - 92:50)
what about my horizons and i'm like if (92:48 - 92:51)
you leave (92:50 - 92:53)
i will abandon this town and the next (92:51 - 92:54)
day they're gone i'm like well get (92:53 - 92:56)
wrecked everybody else you're stuck with (92:54 - 92:59)
hazel i'm i'm out peace (92:56 - 93:02)
this is from box boy (92:59 - 93:04)
uh when you started the podcast did you (93:02 - 93:05)
ever think it would be did you ever (93:04 - 93:06)
think this podcast would be as (93:05 - 93:08)
successful as it is (93:06 - 93:11)
um (93:08 - 93:12)
i (93:11 - 93:14)
don't know how to define success (93:12 - 93:16)
it took us (93:14 - 93:19)
it took us ten plus years to get like an (93:16 - 93:21)
ad deal with the (93:19 - 93:23)
show um (93:21 - 93:25)
that's not true that's not true we used (93:23 - 93:28)
to advertise those socks yeah you used (93:25 - 93:30)
to have a squarespace ad (93:28 - 93:32)
okay those were very one-off i think the (93:30 - 93:35)
sock was like a four ad deal (93:32 - 93:37)
squarespace i think was like a two ad (93:35 - 93:37)
deal (93:37 - 93:40)
i think i i would say the podcast to me (93:37 - 93:41)
is very successful just because of the (93:40 - 93:43)
patreon (93:41 - 93:45)
um and like how many people (93:43 - 93:47)
enjoy the podcast enough to go that (93:45 - 93:50)
extra level to support on patreon um if (93:47 - 93:52)
it if it wasn't for (93:50 - 93:54)
uh both patreon and twitch i don't think (93:52 - 93:56)
i'd be able to do this full time like (93:54 - 93:58)
one of them is not more dominant than (93:56 - 93:59)
the other (93:58 - 94:01)
so i kind of need both (93:59 - 94:03)
but yeah i guess in a sense like (94:01 - 94:05)
having a community around the podcast (94:03 - 94:08)
and having people that want to get extra (94:05 - 94:09)
rewards or just want us there's like a (94:08 - 94:10)
bunch of people who support the patreon (94:09 - 94:12)
and they're like i don't care about (94:10 - 94:14)
rewards here's just my five dollars just (94:12 - 94:16)
keep doing what you're doing (94:14 - 94:17)
um it's like super super flattering but (94:16 - 94:18)
when i (94:17 - 94:22)
started the show in 2010 (94:18 - 94:24)
which was like (94:22 - 94:26)
right after heart gold still silver but (94:24 - 94:27)
before black and white (94:26 - 94:29)
black and white came out in japan first (94:27 - 94:31)
and then everyone had to wait like six (94:29 - 94:32)
months because they weren't doing (94:31 - 94:33)
worldwide games (94:32 - 94:36)
i had like there was like zero desire to (94:33 - 94:38)
make money or to make it a business or (94:36 - 94:40)
any of that stuff like which was funny (94:38 - 94:42)
because we were talking about hobbies (94:40 - 94:44)
every uh the other day on on twitch and (94:42 - 94:46)
it's like a lot of people like (94:44 - 94:47)
it's so it feels like it's so hard to (94:46 - 94:49)
start a hobby now because it's like (94:47 - 94:50)
i want to start a hobby but how do i (94:49 - 94:52)
make money out of this hobby and it's (94:50 - 94:53)
like (94:52 - 94:55)
sometimes (94:53 - 94:57)
you just do it for fun yeah yeah like (94:55 - 94:58)
you can just knit for fun or you can (94:57 - 95:00)
just skateboard for fun or you can just (94:58 - 95:01)
i mean (95:00 - 95:04)
tt rpgs are still my hobby (95:01 - 95:08)
i have written things in that field (95:04 - 95:10)
as a thing that i wanted to do as an (95:08 - 95:12)
extension of that hobby and the money i (95:10 - 95:16)
get from those are like a bonus (95:12 - 95:17)
but (95:16 - 95:18)
it you (95:17 - 95:21)
i do think that people have decided to (95:18 - 95:24)
put a whole like it's not the only (95:21 - 95:26)
measure of success behind the hobbies if (95:24 - 95:28)
you make money off of it and (95:26 - 95:31)
i really want to get back to (95:28 - 95:33)
hobbies are meant to make (95:31 - 95:36)
time pass in fun ways and to make your (95:33 - 95:37)
life fun (95:36 - 95:40)
uh and a lot of the times that is not (95:37 - 95:43)
trying to make money at that hobby yeah (95:40 - 95:45)
so when i when i started the show (95:43 - 95:49)
uh it was like (95:45 - 95:49)
like pot like that was but (95:49 - 95:52)
to me in my head (95:51 - 95:54)
like podcasting is divided into like (95:52 - 95:57)
before cereal and after cereal (95:54 - 95:59)
because i feel like cereal is that one (95:57 - 96:02)
podcast that (95:59 - 96:04)
of the podcast cereal not cereal yeah (96:02 - 96:06)
not like why are we breaking this up not (96:04 - 96:08)
like magic spoon (96:06 - 96:10)
it's like what is going on we do not (96:08 - 96:14)
have that mesonet this week um (96:10 - 96:16)
so like even though podcasting was like (96:14 - 96:17)
a pretty (96:16 - 96:19)
like i would say podcasting is still not (96:17 - 96:21)
like really really mainstream like the (96:19 - 96:23)
people who listen every year they put (96:21 - 96:25)
out an article saying this time podcasts (96:23 - 96:27)
are taken off yeah (96:25 - 96:28)
and then it's it's i think it's like (96:27 - 96:30)
what it's like one in 10 adults listen (96:28 - 96:32)
to podcasts i think (96:30 - 96:35)
which isn't that much (96:32 - 96:39)
i think it's a it's a lot of 10 (96:35 - 96:39)
uh so yeah so when i started the show it (96:40 - 96:45)
was just like i wanted i (96:42 - 96:47)
thought initially i knew a lot about (96:45 - 96:50)
pokemon i didn't back then (96:47 - 96:52)
um and i (96:50 - 96:54)
there was there were other pokemon (96:52 - 96:56)
podcasts but they were inactive (96:54 - 96:58)
and i just wanted to hear people talk (96:56 - 97:00)
about pokemon the way people talked (96:58 - 97:01)
about other games you know i listened to (97:00 - 97:04)
like so many video game podcasts and (97:01 - 97:05)
none of them would really like talk or (97:04 - 97:07)
cover about pokemon so i was like i want (97:05 - 97:08)
to do it because i like love podcasts (97:07 - 97:10)
and i want to do this like in no (97:08 - 97:12)
in no sense was i like (97:10 - 97:13)
i want to make money i was like i just (97:12 - 97:15)
wanted to talk (97:13 - 97:17)
pokemon every week with people and do it (97:15 - 97:19)
and i was excited and i continued to be (97:17 - 97:22)
excited and there was like a small part (97:19 - 97:24)
where i was like oh maybe i won't do (97:22 - 97:25)
this forever (97:24 - 97:28)
um (97:25 - 97:28)
and then i don't know i i kind of just (97:29 - 97:34)
i think i think it was around the time (97:32 - 97:35)
where (97:34 - 97:39)
uh wheels left the show and then greg (97:35 - 97:40)
came on the show (97:39 - 97:42)
which is like (97:40 - 97:44)
and i think greg's energy and greg's (97:42 - 97:47)
excitement really like pushed (97:44 - 97:49)
it forward (97:47 - 97:51)
um (97:49 - 97:53)
and the fact that i'm a very (97:51 - 97:54)
very (97:53 - 97:57)
fast and loud and non-stop talker (97:54 - 97:58)
yeah (97:57 - 97:59)
so (97:58 - 98:00)
difficult to shut me up like the (97:59 - 98:03)
excitement started again there uh and (98:00 - 98:05)
then obviously then i started doing (98:03 - 98:07)
twitch and then i lost my job and then i (98:05 - 98:09)
was like let's pull the trigger to try (98:07 - 98:10)
to make this full time so that's (98:09 - 98:12)
probably a very long-winded answer but (98:10 - 98:14)
like the first (98:12 - 98:16)
four five six years of the show it was (98:14 - 98:18)
just like i just wanted to talk pokemon (98:16 - 98:20)
with people so um so it is very (98:18 - 98:21)
flattering that like there are so many (98:20 - 98:23)
people who support the show now at a (98:21 - 98:24)
level (98:23 - 98:26)
um it's very yeah it's very it's very (98:24 - 98:29)
humbling (98:26 - 98:29)
um (98:30 - 98:32)
uh this is from andrew out of all the (98:34 - 98:37)
distribution events in the past pokemon (98:35 - 98:39)
games that we've never received in (98:37 - 98:43)
america what was the one you wish you've (98:39 - 98:46)
gotten i'm still mad that we didn't get (98:43 - 98:48)
that really great 3ds (98:46 - 98:51)
that only japan got that gold gold x and (98:48 - 98:54)
y one uh i'm (98:51 - 98:56)
to this day (98:54 - 98:58)
throw money at (98:56 - 99:01)
yeah i was like i will fly to japan at (98:58 - 99:02)
this point to get that thing because i (99:01 - 99:04)
wanted it so (99:02 - 99:06)
badly not enough to go onto ebay and buy (99:04 - 99:08)
it because the ebay is sketch (99:06 - 99:10)
um (99:08 - 99:12)
but man i wanted that so (99:10 - 99:16)
much yeah cause i bought (99:12 - 99:17)
like (99:16 - 99:19)
what was it like i bought the red (99:17 - 99:22)
x and y one for me and i bought the blue (99:19 - 99:24)
one for my ex (99:22 - 99:26)
waste of money right there and then but (99:24 - 99:27)
i was still like if they give us the (99:26 - 99:30)
gold one oh yeah buy the gold one (99:27 - 99:34)
because i had i had imported the torchic (99:30 - 99:35)
orange (99:34 - 99:36)
gba (99:35 - 99:37)
and (99:36 - 99:39)
that was at a time that i was like i (99:37 - 99:42)
really need to be not this bad with my (99:39 - 99:45)
money so the thought of doing it again (99:42 - 99:47)
like i couldn't i couldn't fly that past (99:45 - 99:49)
our budget (99:47 - 99:51)
to save it it was just not going to (99:49 - 99:52)
happen because it was like i already (99:51 - 99:53)
have (99:52 - 99:56)
a ton of 3ds's (99:53 - 99:59)
i can i just can't um but i wish if it (99:56 - 100:01)
had come here and been in american (99:59 - 100:03)
pricing then yeah i would snap that up (100:01 - 100:05)
in a second and if the question asker (100:03 - 100:07)
wants us to respond with a pokemon (100:05 - 100:08)
distribution that wasn't in the united (100:07 - 100:10)
states without me having a chart of (100:08 - 100:14)
which ones weren't in front of me (100:10 - 100:14)
any of the jirachi's that were (100:14 - 100:19)
distributed during the (100:16 - 100:19)
what was that called (100:20 - 100:23)
bonnie (100:22 - 100:25)
event (100:23 - 100:26)
gosh i can't remember what it's called (100:25 - 100:28)
now (100:26 - 100:30)
there's an event it's been a lot i mean (100:28 - 100:33)
this series has been around forever (100:30 - 100:37)
yeah um (100:33 - 100:37)
any of the mythicals that like there's (100:37 - 100:40)
been so many good things i don't want (100:38 - 100:43)
any of the pikachus i'll tell you that (100:40 - 100:44)
uh this is from (100:43 - 100:46)
we have all the mythicals so it's like (100:44 - 100:48)
not like we've missed out on anything (100:46 - 100:50)
yeah but whatever they have ribbons and (100:48 - 100:53)
shinies and certain balls nobody cares (100:50 - 100:54)
about ribbons yeah i know i care about (100:53 - 100:55)
ribbons this is from mike what was your (100:54 - 100:58)
most impactful fun and or enjoyable (100:55 - 101:01)
moment in any pokemon game (100:58 - 101:01)
i i talk about this one a lot (101:04 - 101:08)
because this was the mo i mean like so i (101:06 - 101:10)
fell in love with rosalia (101:08 - 101:12)
the minute i saw it the design the face (101:10 - 101:14)
the whole thing it was super sassy and (101:12 - 101:15)
great (101:14 - 101:18)
um the thing that made me (101:15 - 101:22)
love the deeper part of the game was (101:18 - 101:23)
fighting (101:22 - 101:26)
uh kroger at the top of battle mount (101:23 - 101:27)
battle (101:26 - 101:29)
not being able to get past it (101:27 - 101:33)
deliberately making a rosalia to survive (101:29 - 101:35)
hit an ice beam (101:33 - 101:36)
one hp (101:35 - 101:39)
giga drained obliterated kroger (101:36 - 101:41)
won the battle mountain (101:39 - 101:43)
i was like this is the greatest moment (101:41 - 101:47)
of my life i will never top this (101:43 - 101:48)
i think (101:47 - 101:51)
for me and this is obviously hearkening (101:48 - 101:53)
back to a time where i had not any (101:51 - 101:55)
exposure to pokemon community or (101:53 - 101:57)
discussion or anything (101:55 - 101:59)
when i was playing original black and (101:57 - 102:01)
white and i did victory road and i get (101:59 - 102:03)
to the end of victory road and i'm like (102:01 - 102:04)
oh i'm gonna go up against the elite (102:03 - 102:07)
four and what no this huge castle (102:04 - 102:09)
appears out of the ground (102:07 - 102:13)
and it's like nah nah you're doing my (102:09 - 102:15)
biz yeah i was like oh that was so (102:13 - 102:18)
unexpected like (102:15 - 102:20)
and then and and also the fact that they (102:18 - 102:23)
make it so that like after you get (102:20 - 102:24)
through that (102:23 - 102:27)
you can then go back through and have (102:24 - 102:29)
the normal (102:27 - 102:31)
fight you know for the elite four (102:29 - 102:35)
and and champion and all that (102:31 - 102:38)
uh i have two moments one the video game (102:35 - 102:42)
moment i had was when i received the (102:38 - 102:45)
email from the pokemon company that i (102:42 - 102:48)
qualified for players cup 2. (102:45 - 102:50)
uh so that was pretty impactful because (102:48 - 102:53)
i i (102:50 - 102:53)
thought that my competitive knowledge (102:53 - 102:58)
really lacked on the show um and just in (102:55 - 102:59)
general (102:58 - 103:01)
and that was like a void in my pokemon (102:59 - 103:03)
knowledge that i was missing so i paid (103:01 - 103:05)
uh i paid to get coach by like a world (103:03 - 103:06)
champion (103:05 - 103:08)
paul ruiz (103:06 - 103:11)
who won the 2017 (103:08 - 103:13)
world championships i think (103:11 - 103:15)
um so i paid a lot of money to get (103:13 - 103:18)
coached by him for a lot of weeks and to (103:15 - 103:21)
like qualify for that event was was (103:18 - 103:24)
really really fantastic (103:21 - 103:27)
and then the other one was when i was in (103:24 - 103:31)
the uh fort wayne regionals (103:27 - 103:34)
and i was playing sableide darkrai (103:31 - 103:36)
and i was able to top cut that event and (103:34 - 103:37)
at the time it was like the biggest (103:36 - 103:40)
regionals biggest tcg regionals i'm sure (103:37 - 103:41)
the regionals are much much bigger but (103:40 - 103:43)
at the time it was the biggest (103:41 - 103:47)
tcg regionals that ever happened um (103:43 - 103:50)
and i came in top eight (103:47 - 103:52)
uh and it was really really great to (103:50 - 103:54)
come in top eight i can't remember (103:52 - 103:56)
i can't remember what my prize was it (103:54 - 103:57)
was like (103:56 - 103:59)
it was like 16 booster packs i think for (103:57 - 104:02)
coming in top eight um but i did i dead (103:59 - 104:03)
drew (104:02 - 104:04)
uh and i got eliminated in top eight (104:03 - 104:06)
which was like a bummer but and (104:04 - 104:08)
sometimes you just dead draw uh it was (104:06 - 104:10)
funny because the guy was like oh you (104:08 - 104:12)
should beat me easily and i was like i (104:10 - 104:13)
know i'm (104:12 - 104:14)
just (104:13 - 104:17)
i cannot draw one single supporter card (104:14 - 104:19)
i think you're gonna say the time that (104:17 - 104:21)
you beat (104:19 - 104:23)
whoever that was oh wolfgang in line (104:21 - 104:24)
yeah (104:23 - 104:27)
your fake story yeah young [ __ ] yeah (104:24 - 104:30)
john connor we need to get wolfe on this (104:27 - 104:32)
podcast and confirm this fake story (104:30 - 104:35)
you're telling (104:32 - 104:37)
uh this is from nick uh was there a (104:35 - 104:39)
specific moment at the beginning of (104:37 - 104:41)
recording the podcast where you sat down (104:39 - 104:42)
and you thought hey this was going to (104:41 - 104:44)
work (104:42 - 104:45)
um (104:44 - 104:47)
go back and listen to those first ones (104:45 - 104:49)
and i'll tell you the answer is no (104:47 - 104:51)
yeah there was like a lot of like (104:49 - 104:53)
learning how to like do a podcast and (104:51 - 104:54)
like how to edit like every i taught (104:53 - 104:55)
everything myself like i taught myself (104:54 - 104:57)
how to edit it taught myself how to (104:55 - 104:58)
publish tell myself how to like (104:57 - 105:00)
advertise the show all that stuff (104:58 - 105:01)
um (105:00 - 105:04)
the only thing that really like (105:01 - 105:06)
kept me going because when (105:04 - 105:08)
i i published the podcast originally on (105:06 - 105:10)
a platform called dot mac (105:08 - 105:12)
which was part which is now called (105:10 - 105:13)
icloud (105:12 - 105:16)
wow yeah so i mean i still have my (105:13 - 105:18)
document i have still have my mac email (105:16 - 105:19)
i refuse to give it up no matter how (105:18 - 105:21)
much they ask me to give it up and i say (105:19 - 105:23)
no dot mac turned into mobile me which (105:21 - 105:25)
turned into icloud but dot mac one of (105:23 - 105:27)
the things was like you could publish a (105:25 - 105:29)
podcast for free and another thing was (105:27 - 105:30)
like you could make a website for free (105:29 - 105:33)
like it was part of your like 99 a year (105:30 - 105:36)
email address that apple sold (105:33 - 105:37)
but (105:36 - 105:39)
you didn't get like there was like no (105:37 - 105:41)
statistics so i i would just put the (105:39 - 105:43)
podcast out there and then that was it (105:41 - 105:45)
so the only way i knew people were (105:43 - 105:47)
listening uh were like if people wrote (105:45 - 105:49)
in and emailed (105:47 - 105:50)
and so they would like that was like (105:49 - 105:53)
literally the motivation i had (105:50 - 105:54)
at the beginning was like people being (105:53 - 105:56)
like hey i really love the show i can't (105:54 - 105:57)
look (105:56 - 105:59)
the show makes my day (105:57 - 106:01)
um so like just those emails alone was (105:59 - 106:03)
like i have no clue how many like i (106:01 - 106:04)
don't know if like 10 people are (106:03 - 106:05)
listening and one person wrote in i (106:04 - 106:07)
don't know if 100 people are listening i (106:05 - 106:10)
don't know if i don't know um (106:07 - 106:12)
now we're on like an actual proper (106:10 - 106:14)
podcast platform we switched to like (106:12 - 106:16)
three or four years ago um so now we (106:14 - 106:18)
have like accurate stats and all that (106:16 - 106:19)
stuff not that that like changes (106:18 - 106:21)
anything right it's not like let's put (106:19 - 106:24)
asterisk for next to accurate it's (106:21 - 106:26)
exactly what they're willing to get yeah (106:24 - 106:30)
hey it is i i abc's (106:26 - 106:30)
uh (106:36 - 106:38)
this is from (106:39 - 106:43)
mike's given legends method to filling a (106:40 - 106:44)
pokedex what do you think the (106:43 - 106:46)
possibility of having different tracks (106:44 - 106:47)
in future games gym badges versus (106:46 - 106:51)
researcher vs contest participant (106:47 - 106:54)
too complicated yeah i (106:51 - 106:58)
rpgs work best with a linear story (106:54 - 107:02)
um and i i don't think rpgs are going to (106:58 - 107:04)
get (107:02 - 107:07)
too far away from that linear story that (107:04 - 107:09)
they want to tell (107:07 - 107:10)
um (107:09 - 107:11)
so (107:10 - 107:14)
i could see them having alternate tracks (107:11 - 107:15)
to leveling (107:14 - 107:18)
but i think there's always going to be a (107:15 - 107:20)
a plot line that forces you to do these (107:18 - 107:23)
checkpoints and i don't think that's (107:20 - 107:25)
ever going to be like fight a gym or (107:23 - 107:26)
complete this part of the pokedex i (107:25 - 107:29)
think it's always going to be do this (107:26 - 107:31)
trial fight this noble fight this gym (107:29 - 107:33)
whatever iteration of (107:31 - 107:36)
do this boss thing i don't think that (107:33 - 107:37)
will ever change (107:36 - 107:39)
as much as i wanted to like i'd love it (107:37 - 107:42)
to be like you can do gyms or contests i (107:39 - 107:45)
i think that's a lot harder to write (107:42 - 107:47)
from a from just a perspective of what (107:45 - 107:51)
they're going to do with most games (107:47 - 107:51)
yeah i can agree um (107:51 - 107:57)
kinda (107:55 - 107:59)
as from the geeker what is your favorite (107:57 - 108:02)
pokemon related purchase (107:59 - 108:02)
can you see it (108:03 - 108:07)
though (108:04 - 108:07)
no you gotta move it more center (108:09 - 108:12)
i try (108:11 - 108:15)
trying to get it so i can see it here oh (108:12 - 108:17)
dang (108:15 - 108:19)
nope keep going keep going (108:17 - 108:23)
there you go there you go now it's in (108:19 - 108:23)
see i (108:25 - 108:31)
i i if i could rephrase the the (108:27 - 108:34)
question like i i've bought very few (108:31 - 108:37)
pokemon things for myself um (108:34 - 108:39)
i think the (108:37 - 108:42)
safari zone pikachu is probably (108:39 - 108:44)
the most notable um (108:42 - 108:48)
but our longtime japan correspondent (108:44 - 108:50)
uh andrew (108:48 - 108:53)
sent me at one point uh a feroshki that (108:50 - 108:56)
has the x and y starters on it and also (108:53 - 108:58)
it's like a little (108:56 - 109:00)
bag that has the x and y starters on it (108:58 - 109:03)
and i use i use that bag (109:00 - 109:06)
for all of my dice (109:03 - 109:09)
so i literally use that all the time (109:06 - 109:11)
when i play trading card games because (109:09 - 109:13)
that's where i keep all my dice for (109:11 - 109:15)
marking and everything like that so (109:13 - 109:17)
those are my two favorite things and and (109:15 - 109:18)
i used to (109:17 - 109:22)
um i used to wrap my 3ds in the frosh (109:18 - 109:24)
ski (109:22 - 109:24)
um probably my favorite pokemon purchase (109:25 - 109:31)
is probably those metal pokeballs (109:29 - 109:33)
there's just yeah i just i just really (109:31 - 109:35)
like them i think they're really cool (109:33 - 109:39)
uh i think they look great i i just like (109:35 - 109:40)
for things that you can put on your (109:39 - 109:43)
shelves like plushes and (109:40 - 109:46)
um like funko pops i just think the like (109:43 - 109:49)
metal pokeballs are just a really cool (109:46 - 109:51)
collector's item (109:49 - 109:53)
um the skateboards are like cool the (109:51 - 109:55)
pokemon (109:53 - 110:00)
skateboards uh mine's still in the box (109:55 - 110:00)
but i also think like i also think just (110:02 - 110:08)
uh like the expense (110:05 - 110:10)
like when when will and i (110:08 - 110:12)
went to (110:10 - 110:14)
pokemon go fest and the expense of (110:12 - 110:16)
buying a hotel (110:14 - 110:18)
and the drive down there (110:16 - 110:20)
and then playing pokemon go fest and (110:18 - 110:22)
then the next day (110:20 - 110:24)
playing pokemon go in the pouring rain (110:22 - 110:27)
with some listeners of the podcast and (110:24 - 110:29)
catching cresselia (110:27 - 110:31)
like even though that's not a (110:29 - 110:33)
individual purchase like that whole (110:31 - 110:36)
weekend was a pokemon purchase (110:33 - 110:37)
ultimately (110:36 - 110:38)
and like that weekend it was like (110:37 - 110:41)
incredible yeah (110:38 - 110:41)
we did have a lot of fun (110:41 - 110:45)
and irene left early she could have (110:43 - 110:49)
played in the pouring rain with us (110:45 - 110:49)
yeah (110:49 - 110:53)
she already hates being outside being (110:51 - 110:55)
outside the pouring rain is definitely a (110:53 - 110:58)
no-go i mean i read and i went and saw (110:55 - 111:00)
six for that for the one go fest that (110:58 - 111:02)
was a way better experience than sitting (111:00 - 111:04)
in whatever restaurant i think it was (111:02 - 111:06)
that same go fest (111:04 - 111:08)
because that's where steve stole the (111:06 - 111:11)
hotel room the good hotel room for me oh (111:08 - 111:12)
yeah (111:11 - 111:14)
chris stay in the bad hotel oh yeah yeah (111:12 - 111:15)
yeah (111:14 - 111:17)
and then it was me steve and chris and (111:15 - 111:20)
the racer (111:17 - 111:20)
i refuse to tell i read anything about (111:21 - 111:24)
the musical that we're gonna see i just (111:23 - 111:27)
said we're gonna go see this (111:24 - 111:31)
and you're gonna have to trust me (111:27 - 111:31)
uh (111:35 - 111:41)
gosh uh scrolling up for questions (111:37 - 111:44)
uh this is from zach what real world (111:41 - 111:45)
region would you like to see a pokemon (111:44 - 111:49)
region inspired by (111:45 - 111:49)
boy (111:50 - 111:52)
i mean i've answered this before and for (111:51 - 111:55)
me it's uh southern africa or eastern (111:52 - 111:58)
africa definitely uh i would like to see (111:55 - 112:00)
like brazil i would like to see india i (111:58 - 112:03)
would like to see (112:00 - 112:05)
scandinavia (112:03 - 112:09)
um for me it would be egypt right (112:05 - 112:09)
why you covered all of africa like the (112:09 - 112:14)
pier the pyramids the nile river breaks (112:11 - 112:17)
into things (112:14 - 112:18)
like (112:17 - 112:20)
for me for me southern africa because (112:18 - 112:22)
there's like the namibian desert but (112:20 - 112:25)
then south africa itself is more (112:22 - 112:28)
jungle but also urban and also very (112:25 - 112:29)
diverse there's a lot of different (112:28 - 112:32)
cultures represented in south africa and (112:29 - 112:34)
then east africa because then you know (112:32 - 112:36)
you have kilimanjaro so that you could (112:34 - 112:38)
have the ice region and stuff i think (112:36 - 112:39)
scandinavia would be funny because there (112:38 - 112:41)
would be no trainer battles because they (112:39 - 112:42)
would i'll not want to look you in the (112:41 - 112:43)
eye and be like you need to be over (112:42 - 112:45)
there and away from me (112:43 - 112:48)
do your own thing lead me out of this (112:45 - 112:50)
whatever you're doing (112:48 - 112:53)
we're i don't want any part of it (112:50 - 112:54)
after all these years what is the most (112:53 - 112:57)
repeated question you've received (112:54 - 112:59)
what who's your favorite pokemon where (112:57 - 113:01)
would you want a pokemon region (112:59 - 113:03)
where would you want pokemon region (113:01 - 113:06)
probably favorite pokemon uh (113:03 - 113:09)
how did you all meet (113:06 - 113:10)
uh (113:09 - 113:12)
i mean the one we get all the time who's (113:10 - 113:14)
your favorite pokemon like literally all (113:12 - 113:15)
the time (113:14 - 113:17)
uh this is from charon legends is set in (113:15 - 113:19)
the past if we get more legends games (113:17 - 113:21)
would you expect them to (113:19 - 113:24)
uh well you got you you both got a lot (113:21 - 113:25)
of a lot of youtube comments and twitter (113:24 - 113:27)
comments about the (113:25 - 113:31)
past thing because in official um (113:27 - 113:31)
in in official stuff that they (113:32 - 113:36)
completely lie in (113:34 - 113:39)
like let's let's be (113:36 - 113:42)
real they tell you nothing they put (113:39 - 113:43)
something else you buy the game and then (113:42 - 113:44)
you play the game and you're like oh (113:43 - 113:46)
this isn't the past we don't even have (113:44 - 113:49)
time because i could spend half an hour (113:46 - 113:51)
with receipts (113:49 - 113:54)
about why not on twitter (113:51 - 113:56)
i don't know (113:54 - 113:56)
deep the well goes (113:57 - 114:01)
if we get here's the thing okay here's (113:59 - 114:03)
the answer (114:01 - 114:06)
we need to go to ancient joe i know you (114:03 - 114:07)
hate johto (114:06 - 114:10)
we need to go to ancient johto before (114:07 - 114:12)
the tower burned (114:10 - 114:14)
before that and experience something in (114:12 - 114:16)
the time of that event that is a (114:14 - 114:19)
two-hour game i just hate that johto (114:16 - 114:22)
could have so much more and they have (114:19 - 114:24)
have they haves it with the kanto region (114:22 - 114:27)
i want more johto no kanto if we go back (114:24 - 114:29)
into the past and find out that johto (114:27 - 114:32)
wasn't once covered with water (114:29 - 114:34)
and it was a huge land sure i would go (114:32 - 114:36)
back to hohen because i want to go back (114:34 - 114:38)
to the start of the battle between (114:36 - 114:42)
kroger and groupon (114:38 - 114:42)
oh anyways the full question was if we (114:43 - 114:47)
get more legends games what would you (114:45 - 114:48)
expect them to set in the past as (114:47 - 114:50)
opposed to legends unova being set in (114:48 - 114:52)
the future for example in other words (114:50 - 114:54)
would you say a past setting is inherent (114:52 - 114:57)
part of a legends theme (114:54 - 114:57)
legend kind of says that (114:58 - 115:04)
that it that is legit it is of legend of (115:01 - 115:05)
myth (115:04 - 115:10)
uh which is usually set in the past yeah (115:05 - 115:12)
i think it's hard to do a future game (115:10 - 115:14)
um (115:12 - 115:16)
because we are already in such a hot we (115:14 - 115:18)
already in such a weird sci-fi setting (115:16 - 115:20)
with pokemon as it is (115:18 - 115:22)
it doesn't necessarily have to be future (115:20 - 115:24)
but you could think of it as the way of (115:22 - 115:26)
like sun and moon of like (115:24 - 115:29)
why can't we go to where the ultra recon (115:26 - 115:30)
squad like we go to where the ultra (115:29 - 115:32)
recon squad is and it's literally just a (115:30 - 115:34)
hallway and an elevator (115:32 - 115:36)
like they like it looks like a whole (115:34 - 115:38)
city and you can't like actually explore (115:36 - 115:39)
it (115:38 - 115:40)
like (115:39 - 115:42)
if we do like alternate universes yeah (115:40 - 115:44)
i'll go to ultra world (115:42 - 115:48)
it's wrecked i saw that anime (115:44 - 115:51)
it's a nightmare world in there i see (115:48 - 115:55)
the legends is more like a genre (115:51 - 115:56)
so (115:55 - 115:59)
while this one is you know past i think (115:56 - 116:02)
it's kind of like think of more like (115:59 - 116:05)
westerns as a genre so you had what was (116:02 - 116:08)
that space tv show that everybody loved (116:05 - 116:11)
but fox canceled um user-rama (116:08 - 116:12)
no (116:11 - 116:13)
uh (116:12 - 116:19)
firefly firefly right that was a western (116:13 - 116:19)
set (116:19 - 116:21)
i mean technically star wars is a (116:19 - 116:22)
western as well but we don't have that (116:21 - 116:24)
well there's a lot of things we don't (116:22 - 116:26)
have to cover it's like it's like that (116:24 - 116:28)
genre can be applied to different places (116:26 - 116:32)
and then how it is expressed yes (116:28 - 116:35)
so if you just take the idea of (116:32 - 116:36)
um (116:35 - 116:39)
you know striking out into a new area (116:36 - 116:41)
and learning about that area through (116:39 - 116:44)
this pokedex development and everything (116:41 - 116:46)
i think that could be applied to a lot (116:44 - 116:48)
of different scenarios i think one of (116:46 - 116:50)
the strengths for me from what legends (116:48 - 116:53)
arches does is it tells (116:50 - 116:55)
origins (116:53 - 116:58)
we're going to put that in quotes uh of (116:55 - 117:00)
of what we know the world to become and (116:58 - 117:02)
i think that's a very strong selling (117:00 - 117:05)
point so if they do it to other things (117:02 - 117:06)
like i do think it's a strong selling (117:05 - 117:07)
point to say (117:06 - 117:10)
this game is set where the ultra reco (117:07 - 117:11)
recon (117:10 - 117:12)
squad came from (117:11 - 117:14)
so like we're going to go visit that (117:12 - 117:16)
universe because we're going to fill in (117:14 - 117:18)
holes that we didn't answer before i (117:16 - 117:20)
think it's harder to make something set (117:18 - 117:23)
in the future that doesn't tie to a (117:20 - 117:24)
region because you're like well what (117:23 - 117:26)
questions are we answering i mean you (117:24 - 117:28)
could you could the only future i could (117:26 - 117:30)
see is in the which they kind of (117:28 - 117:32)
explored in at the end of ultrasound (117:30 - 117:33)
ultra moon is like (117:32 - 117:34)
what if (117:33 - 117:37)
archie succeeded what if maxie succeeded (117:34 - 117:38)
what would the hoenn region look like (117:37 - 117:40)
now that they succeeded (117:38 - 117:43)
um i mean i do think there's a ripe (117:40 - 117:47)
like alternate universe (117:43 - 117:47)
plotlines that they could do if they (117:47 - 117:51)
wanted if they wanted to stop doing (117:49 - 117:53)
remakes and say let's do an alternate (117:51 - 117:56)
universe version of johto like what if (117:53 - 117:59)
johto was good i'd play that game which (117:56 - 118:01)
is the door they opened at the end of (117:59 - 118:03)
omega ruby alpha sapphire that was the (118:01 - 118:05)
anything goes at this point they opened (118:03 - 118:06)
the anything ghost door yeah they (118:05 - 118:08)
absolutely hoopa (118:06 - 118:10)
uh yeah (118:08 - 118:12)
this is from knox uh what is the one (118:10 - 118:14)
pokemon you would like to see as a real (118:12 - 118:16)
world animal or object designed to be in (118:14 - 118:18)
future regions or what regional variants (118:16 - 118:21)
or current pokemon (118:18 - 118:23)
um (118:21 - 118:23)
that's a weird difficult (118:24 - 118:29)
i mean the default most people want like (118:29 - 118:33)
a dolphin pokemon right haven't gotten (118:31 - 118:37)
that and we asking what pokemon (118:33 - 118:38)
we (118:37 - 118:39)
what real world enemy we want to see as (118:38 - 118:42)
a pokemon read that again (118:39 - 118:44)
oh jeez i gotta scroll up i lost it i (118:42 - 118:46)
unhighlighted it (118:44 - 118:48)
what is one pokemon you would like to (118:46 - 118:51)
see from a real world animal or object (118:48 - 118:53)
be designed for future regions (118:51 - 118:54)
okay yeah (118:53 - 118:55)
uh (118:54 - 118:58)
it is that one uh (118:55 - 118:58)
i find it like eternal pokemon there's (118:58 - 119:02)
just aren't any (119:01 - 119:04)
yeah (119:02 - 119:05)
take (119:04 - 119:08)
uh i still stand by this (119:05 - 119:10)
to all these years it would be great if (119:08 - 119:14)
miltank and tauros had a pre-evolution (119:10 - 119:16)
calf and depending on whether it was (119:14 - 119:19)
male or female would evolve into either (119:16 - 119:20)
miltank or (119:19 - 119:23)
oros you don't need to really have a (119:20 - 119:24)
hairdryer (119:23 - 119:26)
item you could turn it into buffalon (119:24 - 119:29)
because a fish turns into an octopus and (119:26 - 119:30)
a (119:29 - 119:33)
clam turns into a fish wearing a bra but (119:30 - 119:36)
i i do think like a pre evo for miltank (119:33 - 119:38)
tauros would be cool or even buffalan i (119:36 - 119:39)
don't know (119:38 - 119:41)
like hitmonchan hitmontop hitmonlee are (119:39 - 119:45)
all pretty different compared to tyrogue (119:41 - 119:45)
i mean i still want a flamingo (119:46 - 119:51)
there's a lot of birds i still want tiny (119:49 - 119:53)
dogs i still want like hound dogs that (119:51 - 119:55)
aren't just hound doom (119:53 - 119:57)
like fast racing dogs like balton was a (119:55 - 119:59)
very good start (119:57 - 120:01)
but like let's get a chihuahua a teacup (119:59 - 120:03)
poodle let's get these tiny little (120:01 - 120:07)
things that are yippy and snappy (120:03 - 120:07)
i was thinking as a joke to say like (120:07 - 120:11)
water bears it's like you throw it out (120:09 - 120:13)
and nobody can see it (120:11 - 120:15)
nobody can see it it's invisible (120:13 - 120:18)
it's so tiny tiny uh i mean original (120:15 - 120:20)
forms i want to see like (120:18 - 120:22)
i mean i see like regional forms of all (120:20 - 120:23)
my favorites i would love to see a (120:22 - 120:24)
regional form of stable eye i would love (120:23 - 120:26)
to see your original form of rosalia i (120:24 - 120:29)
would love to see a regional form (120:26 - 120:31)
of (120:29 - 120:31)
swinub that skips piloswine (120:31 - 120:35)
i think a real world animal that could (120:38 - 120:42)
be a pokemon (120:40 - 120:44)
maybe like a capybara is that the little (120:42 - 120:47)
cute australian thing yeah so gentle and (120:44 - 120:51)
nice yeah like a nice raticate (120:47 - 120:51)
what would be the first schedule of (120:53 - 120:58)
events at the first pkmn cass con uh (120:54 - 121:00)
first off we already had the first ppm (120:58 - 121:02)
it would be the second (121:00 - 121:04)
yeah just just because these folks (121:02 - 121:05)
weren't invited didn't mean it didn't (121:04 - 121:06)
happen yeah (121:05 - 121:07)
i don't know if that's ever been talked (121:06 - 121:09)
about on the podcast where we like the (121:07 - 121:11)
first schedule event we went to the mac (121:09 - 121:14)
and cheese only restaurant we we did try (121:11 - 121:17)
to like see how a like small convention (121:14 - 121:20)
would work we did it at the dells (121:17 - 121:23)
and we had what it was like (121:20 - 121:25)
14 or 15 people i mean it was like (121:23 - 121:28)
really close friends and and and whatnot (121:25 - 121:29)
it wasn't like (121:28 - 121:32)
like logan was there um greg and will (121:29 - 121:34)
were there (121:32 - 121:35)
uh (121:34 - 121:37)
wheels and (121:35 - 121:40)
their significant other was there um (121:37 - 121:41)
i think those were the people (121:40 - 121:44)
specifically that were on the show (121:41 - 121:45)
yeah and then it was like people that (121:44 - 121:46)
would help out with like the show like (121:45 - 121:48)
micah was there to like do art we had (121:46 - 121:51)
like yeah we had like 14 15 people (121:48 - 121:52)
um (121:51 - 121:53)
and then we were like we can actually (121:52 - 121:55)
probably do this and like make it bigger (121:53 - 121:58)
and have like 50 people (121:55 - 122:00)
and (121:58 - 122:00)
now we're here (122:00 - 122:06)
well well in the middle of sort of (122:02 - 122:07)
thinking about that covet hit really (122:06 - 122:09)
yeah because we had to get past your (122:07 - 122:10)
wedding we had to get all these things (122:09 - 122:12)
and try to get it (122:10 - 122:13)
established and then it was like nope (122:12 - 122:15)
that's never gonna happen (122:13 - 122:19)
uh we would definitely have a uh (122:15 - 122:22)
signing in photos uh fifty dollars for (122:19 - 122:23)
something signed a hundred dollars per (122:22 - 122:25)
photo (122:23 - 122:27)
got it all right it's gonna have to be (122:25 - 122:29)
that's the going price got it uh we (122:27 - 122:31)
would definitely have a panel about (122:29 - 122:33)
something could you have it where like (122:31 - 122:35)
you pay for dinner (122:33 - 122:38)

let's (124:06 - 124:10)
i don't even have a keyboard oh you're (124:08 - 124:12)
killing me here (124:10 - 124:15)
last week's pokemon i it's funny because (124:12 - 124:17)
they all got a clue at the beginning of (124:15 - 124:19)
the program where i said i think this is (124:17 - 124:21)
my favorite pokemon game um but you had (124:19 - 124:24)
to obtain it in that pokemon game and (124:21 - 124:26)
transfer it into (124:24 - 124:28)
a different pokemon game it's a pokemon (124:26 - 124:30)
i have been using through my playthrough (124:28 - 124:31)
of the wonderful brilliant diamond (124:30 - 124:35)
shining pearl games uh (124:31 - 124:38)
and i am disappointed that um (124:35 - 124:40)
most of its (124:38 - 124:42)
types move types are water (124:40 - 124:44)
uh it has access to bug fairy normal (124:42 - 124:46)
poison psyche type moves but they don't (124:44 - 124:49)
cause any damage um (124:46 - 124:52)
and then in the tcg expansions the that (124:49 - 124:54)
pokemon's card included an attack that (124:52 - 124:56)
would allow the player to retrieve water (124:54 - 124:59)
energies from their discard (124:56 - 124:59)
it's (125:00 - 125:05)
boisel (125:03 - 125:07)
wait no boyzell that's the japanese name (125:05 - 125:10)
for weasel oh no it's (125:07 - 125:12)
manafee (125:10 - 125:15)
manife you would get the manafee egg (125:12 - 125:19)
from pokemon ranger and transfer it into (125:15 - 125:22)
diamond and pearl but i was never able (125:19 - 125:24)
to do that because i didn't have two (125:22 - 125:26)
ds's the (125:24 - 125:27)
or friends (125:26 - 125:29)
it has two shuffle icons and one is much (125:27 - 125:32)
better than the other (125:29 - 125:32)
what is our next week pokemon all right (125:32 - 125:37)
clue is on my playthrough of pokemon (125:35 - 125:40)
white which i selected because i prefer (125:37 - 125:43)
zekrom over resharam i selected the only (125:40 - 125:45)
starter that shares a type with one of (125:43 - 125:48)
the box legends and the original (125:45 - 125:50)
mythical for unova (125:48 - 125:52)
the final evolution which we are (125:50 - 125:53)
concerned with today (125:52 - 125:56)
has a name similar to and possibly (125:53 - 125:59)
derived from a move that many starters (125:56 - 126:02)
of the same type learn as their first (125:59 - 126:07)
stab move around level five six or seven (126:02 - 126:09)
all right so easy well there you go hey (126:07 - 126:12)
