[Music] (0:01 - 0:28)

475th episode of the pokemon podcast (0:28 - 0:35)
it's super effective i'm your host sbj (0:32 - 0:36)
hello (0:35 - 0:38)
we got a lot to talk about today do we (0:36 - 0:40)
do something (0:38 - 0:42)
great look i'm not sugarcoating this (0:40 - 0:44)
podcast we're not debating with i don't (0:42 - 0:46)
want any minnesota weather greg's here (0:44 - 0:48)
will's here (0:46 - 0:50)
but are we debating what (0:48 - 0:51)
you are cutting out the thing that (0:50 - 0:53)
people actually listen to the show for (0:51 - 0:55)
the first 10 minutes because back to the (0:53 - 0:57)
boring stuff you know when we're talking (0:55 - 1:00)
about interesting things like our lives (0:57 - 1:01)
like the fact that i went to a wedding (1:00 - 1:03)
yesterday that you'd even ask about you (1:01 - 1:05)
don't even care how brief (1:03 - 1:07)
who's getting married in the summer (1:05 - 1:09)
we're all about fall weddings here (1:07 - 1:10)
uh (1:09 - 1:12)
my friends did and it was lovely and it (1:10 - 1:14)
was a cool day yesterday you didn't even (1:12 - 1:16)
have a full wedding (1:14 - 1:18)
what are you talking about (1:16 - 1:20)
yeah you had a winter wedding yeah the (1:18 - 1:24)
winterist of winter weddings that is the (1:20 - 1:27)
commotion because it sleeted and it was (1:24 - 1:28)
awful (1:27 - 1:29)
that was good the weather was terrible (1:28 - 1:31)
the day the night was good but the (1:29 - 1:34)
weather was bad look no one was going (1:31 - 1:35)
anywhere (1:34 - 1:37)
you got your destination you were stuck (1:35 - 1:39)
there it was a destination wedding that (1:37 - 1:42)
destination being the hotel (1:39 - 1:45)
and you didn't leave it (1:42 - 1:45)
to prevent this from being a 23-hour (1:46 - 1:54)
program one hour per one minute of this (1:48 - 1:54)
uh we're gonna talk about (1:56 - 2:00)
the (1:59 - 2:01)
presents (2:00 - 2:03)
not to be confused with the direct (2:01 - 2:04)
although i don't know if anyone could (2:03 - 2:07)
name the difference between the two (2:04 - 2:07)
and i guess we'll go in order (2:07 - 2:11)
and uh yeah oh for how it started (2:12 - 2:17)
i believe it's it started with pokemon (2:16 - 2:18)
unite (2:17 - 2:21)
oh yeah you are correct greg how many (2:18 - 2:23)
times did you watch it (2:21 - 2:24)
once (2:23 - 2:25)
d (2:24 - 2:26)
minus d (2:25 - 2:30)
minus student (2:26 - 2:30)
is i supposed to study it yes why (2:32 - 2:38)
because you have to catch those like (2:35 - 2:39)
super (2:38 - 2:40)
minute (2:39 - 2:42)
details (2:40 - 2:44)
like mama swine's coming to united and (2:42 - 2:46)
i'm saving up all my coins and not no (2:44 - 2:49)
i'm not buying blastoise i'm saving my (2:46 - 2:51)
money for (2:49 - 2:54)
my wish list that came true (2:51 - 2:55)
the thing i asked what are the things i (2:54 - 2:57)
asked for (2:55 - 2:58)
was sylveon (2:57 - 3:01)
was mammoth (2:58 - 3:02)
all right we'll start with the pokemon (3:01 - 3:04)
unite i have the press release here if (3:02 - 3:06)
you missed the (3:04 - 3:09)
presents um obviously i don't i i find (3:06 - 3:10)
it very hard to believe somebody would (3:09 - 3:12)
listen to this program and not watch it (3:10 - 3:13)
but (3:12 - 3:15)
people are busy i don't know it was 28 (3:13 - 3:17)
minutes (3:15 - 3:19)
pokemon unite is available for download (3:17 - 3:22)
on mobile devices on september 22nd (3:19 - 3:24)
so we got a date for that (3:22 - 3:26)
uh in this title (3:24 - 3:28)
in this title that released on the (3:26 - 3:29)
nintendo switch this last month players (3:28 - 3:31)
will face off against each other on five (3:29 - 3:33)
or five team battles in which they (3:31 - 3:35)
cooperate (3:33 - 3:38)
debatable with teammates to defeat wild (3:35 - 3:39)
pokemon (3:38 - 3:42)
as well as level up their own pokemon to (3:39 - 3:44)
defeat the opposing team in anticipation (3:42 - 3:46)
of the launch on mobile version (3:44 - 3:49)
pre-registration has now begun on the (3:46 - 3:51)
app store and the google play store i (3:49 - 3:52)
don't i haven't done that actually i (3:51 - 3:54)
forgot about that i did i don't even (3:52 - 3:56)
understand what that means registering (3:54 - 3:58)
for what it's just like because they (3:56 - 4:00)
both have where you can like download (3:58 - 4:02)
the app early we'll not download but say (4:00 - 4:05)
you're interested in the app (4:02 - 4:07)
um if pre-registrations press releases (4:05 - 4:10)
anyways totals (4:07 - 4:15)
reaches 2.5 million players uh (4:10 - 4:18)
players will receive the unite license (4:15 - 4:20)
for pikachu (4:18 - 4:21)
i'm assuming if you already have pikachu (4:20 - 4:23)
you get coins kind of like how the (4:21 - 4:25)
thingy with the other thing worked (4:23 - 4:28)
if the total hits (4:25 - 4:30)
million players you will also get a (4:28 - 4:33)
special hollow wear festive style (4:30 - 4:35)
pikachu (4:33 - 4:37)
style (4:35 - 4:39)
if and when those thresholds are reached (4:37 - 4:41)
players can claim the pikachu unite (4:39 - 4:43)
license and the hollower by logging onto (4:41 - 4:45)
the mobile version and completing the (4:43 - 4:48)
log in event by october 31st so not only (4:45 - 4:51)
do you not get it right away (4:48 - 4:53)
you have to do an event you're just (4:51 - 4:54)
unlocking the (4:53 - 4:56)
the event that you have to then do to (4:54 - 4:57)
get it (4:56 - 4:59)
pokemon unite players can also log in (4:57 - 5:00)
the nintendo switch version of the game (4:59 - 5:02)
right now to receive the unite license (5:00 - 5:05)
for zera aura (5:02 - 5:05)
if players link the same account to both (5:07 - 5:10)
the nintendo switch and the mobile (5:09 - 5:12)
version they will be able to use their (5:10 - 5:13)
aura in the mobile version when it (5:12 - 5:15)
launches too trainers can look forward (5:13 - 5:18)
to mamo swine and sylveon coming soon (5:15 - 5:21)
as the next playable pokemon to join in (5:18 - 5:24)
the fray when they say next playable (5:21 - 5:26)
pokemon are they are we just still (5:24 - 5:27)
continuing to skip last one we're (5:26 - 5:29)
skipping blast lights blastoise doesn't (5:27 - 5:31)
work they know it doesn't work (5:29 - 5:33)
and they have to fix it it'll ruin the (5:31 - 5:38)
beta yeah i'm also curious (5:33 - 5:38)
it says you can (5:38 - 5:42)
play zera aura (5:40 - 5:45)
on the mobile version but can you not (5:42 - 5:48)
get the festival style pikachu on the (5:45 - 5:50)
switch version if you connect the two (5:48 - 5:51)
ah (5:50 - 5:53)
i mean i would assume you could but (5:51 - 5:55)
since it calls out one specifically and (5:53 - 5:58)
it does not call out the other well is (5:55 - 6:01)
it also calling out that (5:58 - 6:01)
you cannot buy you can't even buy zero (6:01 - 6:06)
aura on the mobile version (6:04 - 6:08)
i think so like (6:06 - 6:10)
their wording is so specific that it (6:08 - 6:13)
makes me nervous (6:10 - 6:14)
yeah like (6:13 - 6:17)
i'm not happy about that oh no because i (6:14 - 6:20)
mean there's cross play so (6:17 - 6:21)
yeah (6:20 - 6:22)
yeah (6:21 - 6:23)
there's cross play but since they (6:22 - 6:25)
specifically point out (6:23 - 6:28)
the one-way version of zera aura and (6:25 - 6:31)
they don't talk about the other things (6:28 - 6:34)
i'm wondering how deliberate that was or (6:31 - 6:36)
how lazy that was no i don't i don't (6:34 - 6:39)
think so yeah i it would be very weird (6:36 - 6:41)
if it was like well on the mobile (6:39 - 6:43)
version you cannot buy zero aura but if (6:41 - 6:44)
you have the switch version and you got (6:43 - 6:46)
the xero for free or you bought it then (6:44 - 6:50)
like i i can't imagine that would happen (6:46 - 6:52)
i also (6:50 - 6:54)
think (6:52 - 6:55)
i (6:54 - 6:57)
i don't know is a quarter of a million (6:55 - 6:59)
and a half a million (6:57 - 7:03)
pre-orders is that that seems like a lot (6:59 - 7:05)
a quarter of a million no (7:03 - 7:08)
oh sorry (7:05 - 7:10)
sorry five million people (7:08 - 7:12)
that's not a quarter that's (7:10 - 7:15)
millions and more (7:12 - 7:18)
2.5 million or five million this is (7:15 - 7:20)
a lot it's worldwide (7:18 - 7:23)
it's not it's not it's worldwide (7:20 - 7:24)
it's it's it doesn't even have to be (7:23 - 7:26)
people who play all they have to do is (7:24 - 7:29)
indicate that they want to download the (7:26 - 7:31)
game so everybody (7:29 - 7:33)
listening to this download it so we can (7:31 - 7:36)
get the festival style pikachu please (7:33 - 7:38)
it seems like a lot even though that's (7:36 - 7:41)
like an ugly pokemon but sure i mean i (7:38 - 7:45)
mean how many did certain shield cell (7:41 - 7:47)
21 million okay (7:45 - 7:49)
so there are more mobile devices out (7:47 - 7:51)
there than switches switches there are (7:49 - 7:53)
more mobile players out there than (7:51 - 7:56)
switches (7:53 - 7:56)
i would assume that (7:58 - 8:01)
time i knows how many (8:01 - 8:06)
obviously they know how many games like (8:04 - 8:07)
they have call of duty and they have (8:06 - 8:10)
their other moba games so they probably (8:07 - 8:12)
this is probably easy to hit i would (8:10 - 8:14)
assume (8:12 - 8:16)
i mean they'll say it is no matter what (8:14 - 8:19)
because (8:16 - 8:19)
why wouldn't they why wouldn't you say (8:20 - 8:24)
we made a 5 million goal and make it (8:22 - 8:25)
sound like a lot of people are (8:24 - 8:27)
interested in your game whether you hit (8:25 - 8:28)
it or not (8:27 - 8:31)
didn't that mario run game have like (8:28 - 8:32)
10 million downloads or something the (8:31 - 8:34)
first month (8:32 - 8:37)
i don't remember (8:34 - 8:39)
i just did it from the app store so i (8:37 - 8:43)
put my one in there i did too (8:39 - 8:45)
uh well they showed two new characters (8:43 - 8:48)
that showed sylveon and they showed mama (8:45 - 8:51)
swine now there was a leak i don't know (8:48 - 8:53)
if leak is the right word there was (8:51 - 8:54)
rumors speculation i don't know put a (8:53 - 8:57)
big asterisk on what i'm about to say (8:54 - 8:58)
so before (8:57 - 9:00)
blissey came out (8:58 - 9:02)
there with cover your ears if you don't (9:00 - 9:03)
want to hear these this one character (9:02 - 9:06)
that they haven't shown yet but (9:03 - 9:08)
i i we have like no proof whether it's (9:06 - 9:11)
real or not but they before blissey came (9:08 - 9:13)
out there was a (9:11 - 9:15)
i'm gonna leak air quotes here that was (9:13 - 9:18)
blissey sylveon and greedent (9:15 - 9:19)
greetings was the other one yeah i've (9:18 - 9:21)
heard greedon (9:19 - 9:25)
um so well i mean like blissey obviously (9:21 - 9:28)
here it exists it's in the game now uh (9:25 - 9:30)
sylveon they just showed (9:28 - 9:32)
this past week so that seems to be right (9:30 - 9:34)
so i guess maybe it's (9:32 - 9:36)
safe to say that greeden is probably (9:34 - 9:40)
real but not here yet i don't know yeah (9:36 - 9:41)
i mean (9:40 - 9:43)
it is it's hard to say what (9:41 - 9:45)
is going to be playable and what might (9:43 - 9:47)
be things on maps like there are so many (9:45 - 9:49)
things that they are including and if (9:47 - 9:51)
you assume they'll be different maps (9:49 - 9:54)
with different (9:51 - 9:57)
characters to hit and different bosses (9:54 - 9:59)
uh like credent has been a boss before (9:57 - 10:01)
it's been a boston sword and shield so (9:59 - 10:04)
it's hard to say (10:01 - 10:07)
that that necessarily means that it's (10:04 - 10:09)
a playable pokemon (10:07 - 10:11)
is probably in the game we just don't (10:09 - 10:15)
know in what capacity (10:11 - 10:16)
yeah (10:15 - 10:18)
and then they showed sylveon uh which (10:16 - 10:21)
people like and then they showed (10:18 - 10:24)
uh mammo swine (10:21 - 10:27)
so before we get to mama swine (10:24 - 10:28)
are we starting off as evie or are we (10:27 - 10:30)
just gonna get sylvian uh the way they (10:28 - 10:32)
made it sound is it's just sylveon yeah (10:30 - 10:34)
that's what i would guess yeah (10:32 - 10:35)
i mean (10:34 - 10:38)
they already did just just lucario so (10:35 - 10:40)
yeah i mean it'd be really weird to do (10:38 - 10:43)
eevee and then it only evolves into (10:40 - 10:45)
sylveon without like getting into the (10:43 - 10:47)
very complex (10:45 - 10:48)
nature of how you're going to do (10:47 - 10:51)
all the eeveelutions in unite i think (10:48 - 10:53)
they're just going to skip it i'm going (10:51 - 10:55)
to say here's sylvia (10:53 - 10:58)
i'm assuming they aren't just also just (10:55 - 11:00)
giving us mamoswine because mammoth wine (10:58 - 11:02)
has a very direct (11:00 - 11:04)
path of level up (11:02 - 11:06)
yeah i would assume (11:04 - 11:06)
mamo swine is probably gonna be an (11:07 - 11:10)
all-arounder because like every three (11:08 - 11:12)
stage seems to be an all-arounder like (11:10 - 11:14)
charizard car chomp (11:12 - 11:15)
i don't know there's probably another (11:14 - 11:16)
one i'm thinking i can't think i think (11:15 - 11:18)
gardevoir is not an all-arounder (11:16 - 11:21)
that's true (11:18 - 11:21)
i mean i guess man was like a (11:21 - 11:27)
three-stage defender but blastoise is a (11:24 - 11:28)
three-stage defender we know blastoise (11:27 - 11:29)
is a defender it says on the official (11:28 - 11:30)
website (11:29 - 11:33)
uh i would imagine i don't expect it to (11:30 - 11:35)
be a speedster (11:33 - 11:38)
so i'm imagining it's an all-arounder (11:35 - 11:40)
famously kind of bulky and fast and the (11:38 - 11:43)
the screenshots they show though are (11:40 - 11:44)
like (11:43 - 11:47)
they keep showing it in the jungle (11:44 - 11:48)
because it was in the middle of the (11:47 - 11:50)
zapdos and then they show it attacking (11:48 - 11:52)
in the middle uh (11:50 - 11:55)
attacking uh crawdad (11:52 - 11:56)
so (11:55 - 11:58)
[Music] (11:56 - 12:00)
maybe it's an all-arounder i don't know (11:58 - 12:02)
i i don't think it's a defender they (12:00 - 12:03)
showed both of them in very similar (12:02 - 12:06)
situations yeah they did (12:03 - 12:07)
maybe they just like showing off the (12:06 - 12:10)
jungle more interesting than elaine (12:07 - 12:12)
everybody's like jungle (12:10 - 12:16)
jungle mammoth's my new jungle maine (12:12 - 12:18)
well i tell you i had a jungle blissey (12:16 - 12:20)
the other good night in the game (12:18 - 12:21)
yeah unless you went into the jungle i'm (12:20 - 12:23)
like what are you doing was it did you (12:21 - 12:26)
win no (12:23 - 12:28)
we did not (12:26 - 12:31)
uh we i had a jungle mr mime one time i (12:28 - 12:33)
said that they were on the other (12:31 - 12:34)
person's team (12:33 - 12:37)
and they were very good (12:34 - 12:38)
uh we lost (12:37 - 12:41)
[Laughter] (12:38 - 12:43)
uh yeah so they that they opened with (12:41 - 12:45)
unite that's pretty much all the united (12:43 - 12:47)
news uh two new characters the mobile (12:45 - 12:50)
date um i i think some people walked (12:47 - 12:53)
away being like oh cross play is a thing (12:50 - 12:53)
that (12:53 - 12:55)
they they definitely said this yeah they (12:53 - 12:58)
definitely said that before (12:55 - 12:59)
they said cross account and cross play (12:58 - 13:02)
would be things um but it's nice for (12:59 - 13:05)
them to like reconfirm that (13:02 - 13:07)
uh and i guess people finally heard it (13:05 - 13:08)
this time so (13:07 - 13:10)
i you know here's the question before we (13:08 - 13:13)
move on from unite (13:10 - 13:13)
the switch is not the most powerful (13:14 - 13:17)
system in the world (13:15 - 13:19)
uh you can see your frame rate in the (13:17 - 13:21)
upper corner it'll say like (13:19 - 13:24)
it never says 60 at all it's like 47 or (13:21 - 13:25)
50. (13:24 - 13:28)
47.48 yeah (13:25 - 13:30)
do you think that if let's say this was (13:28 - 13:32)
your favorite game ever (13:30 - 13:34)
unite was it it was your go-to you plan (13:32 - 13:36)
on dedicating your next 10 years to it (13:34 - 13:38)
league of legends in the garbage those (13:36 - 13:40)
people are out there yep (13:38 - 13:43)
do you think you would buy like the best (13:40 - 13:45)
ipad out there and just hook a (13:43 - 13:47)
playstation controller up to it and just (13:45 - 13:49)
play unite that way because it would i (13:47 - 13:51)
would i would assume even a three to (13:49 - 13:53)
four year old ipad would run better than (13:51 - 13:55)
the switch (13:53 - 13:55)
i mean maybe i mean i might (13:59 - 14:05)
i mean i have a i have a new ipad (14:02 - 14:06)
but i mean i'm just downloading it does (14:05 - 14:09)
it have to be an ipad could it be like a (14:06 - 14:12)
less expensive android device that has a (14:09 - 14:17)
high power processor and screen (14:12 - 14:19)
then the switch guess but (14:17 - 14:22)
i mean does it need the thick the tablet (14:19 - 14:25)
world the ipad is the dominant device (14:22 - 14:30)
and now i'm not so sure about that (14:25 - 14:33)
i mean what like (14:30 - 14:33)
is the frame rate that important to that (14:38 - 14:42)
game (14:40 - 14:43)
i don't know i (14:42 - 14:45)
if you just want an overall smoother (14:43 - 14:47)
experience i think the problem is like (14:45 - 14:48)
you're still going to get to that menu (14:47 - 14:50)
selection screen and it's still going to (14:48 - 14:52)
be super laggy because yeah it's trying (14:50 - 14:55)
to load in 10 people the only the only (14:52 - 14:58)
issue i ever seem to have is lag in the (14:55 - 15:01)
game not frame rate it's just like oh (14:58 - 15:02)
there's internet leg (15:01 - 15:03)
yeah (15:02 - 15:05)
i don't really notice (15:03 - 15:08)
like oh this isn't the highest quality (15:05 - 15:12)
of low quality graphics (15:08 - 15:12)
yeah i don't know i think it would be (15:12 - 15:17)
nice to have like (15:14 - 15:17)
i think the only thing that would (15:17 - 15:21)
make me switch from a switch to (15:18 - 15:22)
like an ipad is i would assume the (15:21 - 15:26)
controller would be more customizable (15:22 - 15:27)
because because on the switch version (15:26 - 15:29)
you can only (15:27 - 15:32)
you can't move the map and you can't (15:29 - 15:33)
move the (15:32 - 15:35)
like attacks off the shoulder buttons (15:33 - 15:37)
you can move them around the shoulder (15:35 - 15:39)
buttons but they're limited to it so and (15:37 - 15:40)
then like the chat (15:39 - 15:42)
has to stay on the d-pad for the switch (15:40 - 15:44)
version you can't like (15:42 - 15:46)
move it up to like the shoulder buttons (15:44 - 15:49)
if you wanted to so it is very (15:46 - 15:50)
like even though that the switch version (15:49 - 15:51)
has (15:50 - 15:53)
you know a control setting i would (15:51 - 15:55)
assume that like an ipad or an iv (15:53 - 15:56)
android version you could really (15:55 - 15:58)
customize the controls (15:56 - 16:00)
why would you assume that (15:58 - 16:04)
why what would restrict it why (16:00 - 16:05)
why would (16:04 - 16:07)
because the controls are determined by (16:05 - 16:08)
the app (16:07 - 16:11)
not by the platform yeah but if you're (16:08 - 16:12)
talking android you can do literally (16:11 - 16:14)
anything on android that's hacking (16:12 - 16:18)
that's that's that is that is illegal (16:14 - 16:23)
no you cannot and if you don't (16:18 - 16:23)
if you're going to go that far just (16:26 - 16:30)
install an android emulator on a desktop (16:28 - 16:31)
computer (16:30 - 16:34)
and go that way yeah because that way (16:31 - 16:36)
you'll get the best performance i would (16:34 - 16:38)
not be surprised if people do that yeah (16:36 - 16:40)
i'm sure but you're not gonna then (16:38 - 16:43)
become world champion and walk into (16:40 - 16:46)
uh an esports competition carrying your (16:43 - 16:48)
desktop computer and say oh but this is (16:46 - 16:49)
how i (16:48 - 16:50)
play you're going to say because you're (16:49 - 16:52)
disqualified (16:50 - 16:54)
you have to play the game the way the (16:52 - 16:55)
game was made and if you go beyond that (16:54 - 16:57)
it's broken and you're a bad person well (16:55 - 16:59)
if you go beyond that plus ultra but (16:57 - 17:01)
plus ultra (16:59 - 17:04)
oh the most episode (17:01 - 17:04)
i guess we're also assuming (17:05 - 17:09)
that you can even hook a controller up (17:07 - 17:11)
to the mobile version i would assume you (17:09 - 17:12)
could because (17:11 - 17:14)
i would assume you could i would give (17:12 - 17:16)
that yes (17:14 - 17:19)
because the platforms do support (17:16 - 17:20)
yeah (17:19 - 17:22)
the like bluetooth controllers i mean (17:20 - 17:23)
now i feel like i have to get a (17:22 - 17:25)
controller for my ipad which means i (17:23 - 17:27)
have no reason not to jump back into (17:25 - 17:29)
gungeon impact if i do this you just (17:27 - 17:31)
don't have like a bad situation you (17:29 - 17:32)
don't have (17:31 - 17:34)
playstation controller or the xbox (17:32 - 17:35)
controller why would he have either of (17:34 - 17:37)
those he does not have a playstation or (17:35 - 17:41)
an xbox i have a playstation (17:37 - 17:41)
4 (17:41 - 17:45)
yeah there you go that's all you need (17:43 - 17:47)
uh just the ps4 controller (17:45 - 17:50)
yes ps4 ps4 ps5 something and i have an (17:47 - 17:53)
xbox (17:50 - 17:56)
something one (17:53 - 17:57)
do you really (17:56 - 17:59)
yeah how come you didn't friend me on (17:57 - 18:01)
either of these platforms because i (17:59 - 18:03)
never (18:01 - 18:05)
i have not turned mavic we disconnected (18:03 - 18:06)
them (18:05 - 18:08)
uh when we moved our living around (18:06 - 18:10)
except for i think i reconnected the (18:08 - 18:13)
xbox i don't know why because i still (18:10 - 18:14)
haven't turned it on (18:13 - 18:17)
the problem is there's two xbox one (18:14 - 18:19)
controllers one of them is compatible (18:17 - 18:22)
with ipad one is not so i would say go (18:19 - 18:25)
playstation (18:22 - 18:26)
i've heard that the playstation (18:25 - 18:29)
controllers are easier to hook up i mean (18:26 - 18:31)
can i just buy a controller specifically (18:29 - 18:33)
for the ipad and just connect it yeah (18:31 - 18:35)
but why would you do that when you could (18:33 - 18:36)
just get the playstation controller (18:35 - 18:38)
which is like the best controller out (18:36 - 18:41)
there because it a i don't know where it (18:38 - 18:43)
version i is (18:41 - 18:44)
no because the joysticks are both down (18:43 - 18:47)
it's nice now that's no okay so the (18:44 - 18:49)
switch the switch pro controller is (18:47 - 18:50)
garbage (18:49 - 18:53)
i prefer a playstation 4 controller over (18:50 - 18:55)
the switch pro controller (18:53 - 18:58)
i would hardly disagree except for the (18:55 - 19:00)
fact that katamari damasi does play (18:58 - 19:03)
better when the sticks are parallel (19:00 - 19:05)
it does (19:03 - 19:06)
uh (19:05 - 19:08)
they then showed pokemon go which wasn't (19:06 - 19:11)
anything specifically new (19:08 - 19:13)
uh they just showed some of that like (19:11 - 19:14)
wulu squelvet (19:13 - 19:17)
hey hoopa is (19:14 - 19:21)
making zashian and zamasunta and (19:17 - 19:22)
we're just skipping (19:21 - 19:24)
alola altogether (19:22 - 19:27)
yeah i'm not thrilled about i kind of (19:24 - 19:28)
which is weird which i don't have a (19:27 - 19:30)
problem with (19:28 - 19:33)
it it kind of goes with the (19:30 - 19:35)
i i feel like sometimes the pokemon (19:33 - 19:38)
company it starts to establish patterns (19:35 - 19:39)
we talk about it all the time in the (19:38 - 19:40)
show everyone likes to talk about the (19:39 - 19:42)
patterns on twitter you know gen 8 was (19:40 - 19:44)
supposed to have two new eevee (19:42 - 19:46)
evolutions because gen 2 had evs and gen (19:44 - 19:49)
4 had evs and gen 6 had evs so gen 8 (19:46 - 19:51)
must have new evs and that didn't happen (19:49 - 19:54)
um (19:51 - 19:56)
i feel like sometimes they're just like (19:54 - 19:58)
you know (19:56 - 19:58)
we we started a pattern we don't like (19:58 - 20:03)
this skip gen seven do it (20:00 - 20:04)
we gotta throw them for a loop (20:03 - 20:06)
i mean are we going to talk about the (20:04 - 20:09)
fact that the pokemon go song got lyrics (20:06 - 20:12)
the only the night time (20:09 - 20:14)
no because i refuse to listen to any (20:12 - 20:16)
audio from pokemon go all together it (20:14 - 20:20)
gives me youtube true i (20:16 - 20:22)
i didn't look it up (20:20 - 20:25)
and ashwag's coming to community day (20:22 - 20:28)
yes password is coming in community yeah (20:25 - 20:31)
so well we can't record sunday the (20:28 - 20:34)
19th we have to come up with a different (20:31 - 20:36)
day that's fine we can record early the (20:34 - 20:37)
one thing i want to say that wasn't (20:36 - 20:40)
shown in the du ra the presents but we (20:37 - 20:42)
should talk about is pokemon go is (20:40 - 20:44)
terribly broken right now (20:42 - 20:47)
they put phalanx in raids and then (20:44 - 20:49)
people couldn't see phalanx because it (20:47 - 20:51)
was too zoomed in so they had to like (20:49 - 20:53)
remove phalanx from raids and then they (20:51 - 20:55)
put i don't know they put like alec (20:53 - 20:58)
machamp or something to like substitute (20:55 - 20:59)
and then (20:58 - 21:01)
if you put phalanx as your buddy pokemon (20:59 - 21:04)
he's just vertical he doesn't actually (21:01 - 21:05)
like follow you he just goes like (21:04 - 21:08)
straight up like a totem pole (21:05 - 21:10)
like yeah he like doesn't look good in (21:08 - 21:12)
the menu i don't it's just phalanx (21:10 - 21:14)
really feel like this is ruined this (21:12 - 21:16)
game i haven't i also haven't found a (21:14 - 21:18)
failings like i think i mean i just got (21:16 - 21:21)
20 of them on my bike ride this morning (21:18 - 21:23)
uh i haven't seen any in my area i (21:21 - 21:26)
haven't seen any of my any raids either (21:23 - 21:29)
it's just not well he's not right (21:26 - 21:30)
i got (21:29 - 21:32)
they did bump him up in the wild and i (21:30 - 21:34)
believe he's in eggs but i've seen like (21:32 - 21:36)
i don't know in the last 48 hours i've (21:34 - 21:39)
seen like three in my house i got i (21:36 - 21:41)

galler ones that are (21:41 - 21:46)
dropped i got squabbits i got wulu's i (21:44 - 21:48)

didn't do a raid one though (21:59 - 22:02)
but i've not had a phalanx (22:03 - 22:08)
yeah they're around i got it i see their (22:06 - 22:11)
shadows they just don't come to me (22:08 - 22:13)
i got one in my house right now i have a (22:11 - 22:15)
pokemon go public service announcement (22:13 - 22:19)
about raids um if you're intending to (22:15 - 22:21)
invite me to a remote marine and it's (22:19 - 22:23)
gallerian wheezing i will be removing (22:21 - 22:26)
you from my friend list (22:23 - 22:27)
why it could be shiny (22:26 - 22:30)
don't i don't need (22:27 - 22:32)
shiny gallerian wheezing i don't that i (22:30 - 22:34)
don't need to spend a remote raid pass (22:32 - 22:36)
on that thanks (22:34 - 22:38)
also (22:36 - 22:40)
the notification system is really bad so (22:38 - 22:42)
you can send me things (22:40 - 22:45)
and i'll see it on my phone (22:42 - 22:48)
and by the time it actually pops up (22:45 - 22:51)
the lobby's gone (22:48 - 22:53)
yeah okay can we also talk about just (22:51 - 22:56)
okay how are we (22:53 - 22:58)
we're here this far into the life cycle (22:56 - 23:01)
of sword and shield uh-huh and the why (22:58 - 23:04)
calm is still that bad (23:01 - 23:06)
cause they haven't expect them to fix it (23:04 - 23:07)
yes (23:06 - 23:09)
people expect them to add the rest of (23:07 - 23:12)
the pokemon too (23:09 - 23:13)
i mean (23:12 - 23:15)
it is (23:13 - 23:16)
so bad (23:15 - 23:18)
trying to do (23:16 - 23:19)
chandelure (23:18 - 23:22)
raids this weekend and she was like i (23:19 - 23:25)
have the rate up and i'm like well (23:22 - 23:27)
maybe maybe wycombe will decide to show (23:25 - 23:29)
me we'll just keep hitting it (23:27 - 23:31)
restart it maybe it will start that it (23:29 - 23:33)
is so (23:31 - 23:36)
awful it is bad and i still can't (23:33 - 23:38)
believe like (23:36 - 23:39)
we are (23:38 - 23:41)
two years into its life cycle and they (23:39 - 23:43)
haven't even like (23:41 - 23:44)
stated we're looking into it i think (23:43 - 23:46)
it's just like nope it's gonna always be (23:44 - 23:49)
bad it's just bad yeah they got another (23:46 - 23:51)
they got other games to work on the one (23:49 - 23:53)
of my problems is anything internet (23:51 - 23:56)
related it's just it's even in 2021 it's (23:53 - 23:58)
so fragile (23:56 - 23:59)
it's like they could change one thing (23:58 - 24:00)
and be like oh this is going to improve (23:59 - 24:02)
it and then all of a sudden why calm (24:00 - 24:04)
doesn't work at all anymore ever it (24:02 - 24:06)
doesn't work now well i mean it kind of (24:04 - 24:09)
sometimes works (24:06 - 24:11)
i mean if they could just (24:09 - 24:13)
dynomax adventure like they got it (24:11 - 24:16)
mostly right (24:13 - 24:17)
yes mostly (24:16 - 24:19)
oh i would take the dynamics adventure (24:17 - 24:22)
system over the i i would as well (24:19 - 24:23)
uh (24:22 - 24:25)
but we don't live in that world we live (24:23 - 24:26)
in a world where they're not fixing the (24:25 - 24:29)
wycombe (24:26 - 24:29)
pokemon go very short during the (24:31 - 24:35)

little i don't know they spent like what (26:44 - 26:50)
two ma two minutes on masters yep and (26:45 - 26:51)
you know i was streaming this live on (26:50 - 26:52)

the amount of people who don't play (26:54 - 26:59)
masters uh uh in twitch is is a lot you (26:56 - 27:00)
know some people just don't like the (26:59 - 27:02)
gotchas i get it (27:00 - 27:04)
but they were really interested once it (27:02 - 27:06)
said up to 100 sink pairs for free (27:04 - 27:09)
that's a lot of sink pairs yeah and i (27:06 - 27:11)

10 pulls 10 10 pulls (27:21 - 27:26)
and there's no guarantee that you're (27:25 - 27:28)
gonna get anything good (27:26 - 27:31)
but hey at least it's free it's it's (27:28 - 27:35)
still they didn't like (27:31 - 27:38)
they didn't like uh adjust the odds for (27:35 - 27:40)
it it didn't it's a it's a seven percent (27:38 - 27:43)
chance for five stars which is what you (27:40 - 27:44)
want it's like a (27:43 - 27:47)
12 what what is it like 15 chance for (27:44 - 27:49)
four stars or something like that then (27:47 - 27:51)
it's like a 75 chance of three stars (27:49 - 27:52)
which is (27:51 - 27:54)
the majority um (27:52 - 27:56)
but you get this little ticket when you (27:54 - 27:58)
log in i think you have more than 10 (27:56 - 28:00)
days to log in so they do give you i (27:58 - 28:04)
think it's up to september 15th (28:00 - 28:06)
i think so so like if you're listening (28:04 - 28:07)
to this podcast and you're on the fence (28:06 - 28:09)
for pokemon masters you're already going (28:07 - 28:12)
to get 3000 gems just for logging in now (28:09 - 28:15)
3 000 gems is a normal 10 pole (28:12 - 28:16)
in the game (28:15 - 28:19)
it's seven percent for a five star (28:16 - 28:22)
twenty percent for a four star and (28:19 - 28:24)
seventy three percent for everything (28:22 - 28:28)
else which is right three stars so then (28:24 - 28:30)
you can get all three stars on your free (28:28 - 28:32)
pull yes i have done multiple you can (28:30 - 28:34)
also get all three stars on your paid (28:32 - 28:36)
plus you can (28:34 - 28:38)
it's really it's still really a bad (28:36 - 28:39)
system but (28:38 - 28:42)
so there there is a different system (28:39 - 28:44)
currently in the game right now um well (28:42 - 28:45)
not currently but that exists it's (28:44 - 28:47)
called fair scout which is what the leon (28:45 - 28:50)
banner is so (28:47 - 28:52)
leon so normally when a poke trainer is (28:50 - 28:55)
on a banner a banner being like oh i (28:52 - 28:56)
want to pull on leon or i want to pull (28:55 - 28:59)
on nessa or i want to pull on hop (28:56 - 29:00)
that doesn't well hops technically free (28:59 - 29:03)
but protect um (29:00 - 29:05)
they're normally two percent so you have (29:03 - 29:06)
a two percent chance of getting leon you (29:05 - 29:08)
got two percent chance of getting gloria (29:06 - 29:09)
you got two percent chance of getting (29:08 - 29:11)
nessa (29:09 - 29:13)
but in a fair scout (29:11 - 29:15)
when they you have a ten percent of (29:13 - 29:19)
getting five instead of a seven percent (29:15 - 29:21)
so leon right now is fair scout so let's (29:19 - 29:22)
say you're new to pokemon masters you (29:21 - 29:24)
want the hundred free sync pairs it's a (29:22 - 29:26)
lot of sync pairs it is genuine even if (29:24 - 29:28)
you get a lot of threes you're probably (29:26 - 29:30)
going to get at least a handful of fives (29:28 - 29:32)
so like it's still totally worth it (29:30 - 29:34)
um and it's free and it's free i mean (29:32 - 29:36)
it's worth it because it's free right (29:34 - 29:39)
and i don't think (29:36 - 29:41)
unless you're making content saving them (29:39 - 29:43)
up like they're not going to add (29:41 - 29:45)
anything new (29:43 - 29:47)
the new banners are not going into this (29:45 - 29:48)
10 poll (29:47 - 29:52)
the temple is set so just use them (29:48 - 29:53)
they're not going to be like on (29:52 - 29:55)
september 14th add a bunch of things (29:53 - 29:57)
they didn't add before it's done this is (29:55 - 29:59)
it (29:57 - 29:59)
you can't save the tickets though you're (30:00 - 30:02)
like you don't have to like right (30:01 - 30:05)
you you'll get 10 tickets total uh if (30:02 - 30:07)
you do decide to play and you get the 3 (30:05 - 30:10)
000 gems you can either i would maybe (30:07 - 30:12)
suggest pulling on leon (30:10 - 30:15)
uh because it is fair scout (30:12 - 30:17)
and you can't use your free 10 poles for (30:15 - 30:18)
leon (30:17 - 30:21)
yep or you can maybe save for end which (30:18 - 30:23)
is one of the (30:21 - 30:25)
two year anniversary things (30:23 - 30:27)
which his i don't know his outfit's kind (30:25 - 30:28)
of okay (30:27 - 30:29)
it's (30:28 - 30:31)
it's a wedding outfit he's finally here (30:29 - 30:33)
to make good on what happened in the (30:31 - 30:36)
ferris wheel finally make make you an (30:33 - 30:39)
honest person after that incident (30:36 - 30:42)
uh green hair is an auto now on me (30:39 - 30:44)
so (30:42 - 30:44)
uh what was he gonna say about the tent (30:45 - 30:50)
pole (30:48 - 30:52)
okay so oh oh (30:50 - 30:55)
go in now because the sycamore event is (30:52 - 30:58)
back and the sycamores ernie's (30:55 - 31:00)
pair is like (30:58 - 31:03)
the most powerful free pair you can get (31:00 - 31:04)
and it's free and it's free you just (31:03 - 31:06)
have to complete that storyline that (31:04 - 31:08)
storyline isn't difficult to do (31:06 - 31:11)
i strongly strongly strongly suggest if (31:08 - 31:12)
you are interested in going in and (31:11 - 31:14)
playing play it now (31:12 - 31:18)
while the sycamore event is still live (31:14 - 31:20)
uh i don't remember when it ends i will (31:18 - 31:22)
look here real quick (31:20 - 31:24)
this is the thing about masters and (31:22 - 31:25)
we've talked about this on the show i (31:24 - 31:28)
don't know at what like the game is two (31:25 - 31:29)
years old (31:28 - 31:31)
i don't know what they could do at this (31:29 - 31:33)
point to convince people to play this (31:31 - 31:35)
video game and when they (31:33 - 31:37)
were like we're giving you a hundred (31:35 - 31:39)
sing pairs for free (31:37 - 31:41)
i was like okay i think that's how you (31:39 - 31:43)
convince people to finally play this (31:41 - 31:45)
game like that is that is a (31:43 - 31:48)
huge um like you're you're forcing (31:45 - 31:49)
you're not forcing but you're (31:48 - 31:51)
encouraging people to log in 10 days in (31:49 - 31:53)
a row once they log in they're gonna get (31:51 - 31:55)
their polls they're gonna maybe get a (31:53 - 31:57)
character they like they're gonna poke (31:55 - 31:59)
around the app like this is probably the (31:57 - 32:01)
best way (31:59 - 32:02)
to convince somebody that they should (32:01 - 32:05)
check out this game yeah how many sink (32:02 - 32:07)
pairs total are available in the game (32:05 - 32:08)
too many uh (32:07 - 32:11)
i can find out in a sec uh the legendary (32:08 - 32:13)
events that are currently active which (32:11 - 32:16)
are getsis sycamore and cyrus are up (32:13 - 32:19)
until 9 16. (32:16 - 32:23)
and normally um normally to pull so 3000 (32:19 - 32:24)
gems you get that for free too when (32:23 - 32:26)
you're logging in 3000 gems is about (32:24 - 32:29)
like 20 to 25 dollars in the game there (32:26 - 32:32)
is a 178 potential sink pairs right now (32:29 - 32:34)
jeez okay so there's no way to pull them (32:32 - 32:37)
all for free (32:34 - 32:38)
in this method (32:37 - 32:40)
if you're real lucky if you get it a (32:38 - 32:42)
bunch of them are free a bunch of them (32:40 - 32:46)
come from eggs so (32:42 - 32:48)
like you can get you can get there a lot (32:46 - 32:50)
of them come from bp (32:48 - 32:52)
so (32:50 - 32:54)
how does the egg work like the pokemon (32:52 - 32:56)
hatches from the egg and somebody walks (32:54 - 32:59)
up and says i paired with that one so (32:56 - 33:01)
you pair with it you yourself you your (32:59 - 33:04)
character pairs with it (33:01 - 33:04)
so (33:04 - 33:06)
yeah your own character pairs with it (33:04 - 33:09)
you get eggs by doing like training (33:06 - 33:12)
missions you can hold like four to eight (33:09 - 33:14)
eggs or whatever so all i'm saying is (33:12 - 33:17)
the storytelling consistency and logic (33:14 - 33:20)
of casio is a bit sus (33:17 - 33:22)
yes but they do do some good stories (33:20 - 33:23)
like the eternity story i think is (33:22 - 33:26)
really good the silver and giovanni's (33:23 - 33:28)
story was really good the guest's story (33:26 - 33:30)
was meh (33:28 - 33:32)
uh the you know cyrus wanted to marry a (33:30 - 33:35)
rotom in in pokemon masters so you know (33:32 - 33:39)
i'm withholding all judgment until this (33:35 - 33:43)
fall event where all of the evil (33:39 - 33:45)
teams you guys thought were going to be (33:43 - 33:47)
friendly because they live on pacio now (33:45 - 33:52)
turn and sabotage and saboteur and get (33:47 - 33:54)
getcha the only villain that has (33:52 - 33:57)
somewhat come across this slightly (33:54 - 33:59)
friendly is loosamine (33:57 - 34:01)
everybody else is like i still plan on (33:59 - 34:02)
destroying the world but i'm gonna work (34:01 - 34:03)
with you for a while because i can't get (34:02 - 34:05)
off this island (34:03 - 34:07)
except for cyrus he's really obsessed (34:05 - 34:09)
with that rotom the minute i can get out (34:07 - 34:10)
of this (34:09 - 34:12)
i'm going to blow everything up (34:10 - 34:14)
and get it so it's like lost (34:12 - 34:16)
yeah tv show guests and giovanni are (34:14 - 34:18)
already (34:16 - 34:19)
already hate each other (34:18 - 34:22)
they establish this in story they hate (34:19 - 34:24)
each other so this villain's event (34:22 - 34:27)
should be very exciting (34:24 - 34:29)
and uh they showed a silhouette of rose (34:27 - 34:32)
in the villains event which is cool (34:29 - 34:34)
rose is coming (34:32 - 34:36)
maybe i don't know it could be like (34:34 - 34:38)
diana on the cover and not come for two (34:36 - 34:40)
more years (34:38 - 34:41)
i don't know that the giovanni is (34:40 - 34:44)
rainbow rocket giovanni yeah so rainbow (34:41 - 34:46)
right so regular giovanni's in the game (34:44 - 34:48)
but it's rainbow rocket in the villains (34:46 - 34:50)
event so that's (34:48 - 34:52)
i'm wondering if we get a new giovanni (34:50 - 34:54)
pair did you see that the (34:52 - 34:56)
sigma suit giovanni did you see in the (34:54 - 34:58)
spanish version of the pokemon presents (34:56 - 34:59)
they (34:58 - 35:01)
included that (34:59 - 35:03)
giovanni will have mega mewtwo (35:01 - 35:06)
oh no i didn't see that yeah it was (35:03 - 35:08)
making me too why it was the baby (35:06 - 35:09)
looking one not the (35:08 - 35:11)
one so that must be what i wonder if (35:09 - 35:12)
they're gonna make it cigna suit or just (35:11 - 35:14)
a different (35:12 - 35:15)
yeah (35:14 - 35:16)
i don't know (35:15 - 35:18)
i noticed the rainbow rocket as well (35:16 - 35:19)
yeah (35:18 - 35:21)
again like i don't know if you're on the (35:19 - 35:23)
fence for pokemon masters like this is (35:21 - 35:25)
this is probably as good as it's getting (35:23 - 35:26)
like they're really (35:25 - 35:29)
pushing yeah (35:26 - 35:31)
and it's good like i don't i don't think (35:29 - 35:32)
it's bad i mean a lot of synth pairs for (35:31 - 35:34)
free a bunch of gems like you get your (35:32 - 35:36)
3000 gems plus you get your daily log (35:34 - 35:38)
and gyms plus you get your event gems (35:36 - 35:40)
um (35:38 - 35:41)
i don't know i i think it's worth trying (35:40 - 35:43)
i mean it's free it's free you're (35:41 - 35:44)
getting a bunch of stuff for free so (35:43 - 35:46)
play around with it and if you hate it (35:44 - 35:48)
you hate it yeah you didn't lose (35:46 - 35:49)
anything you maybe pulled a lucid me and (35:48 - 35:50)
you're like well (35:49 - 35:54)
let's move on okay i got a challah (35:50 - 35:54)
another bryson man wow the bread no (35:55 - 36:03)
uh the last thing before we get to the (36:00 - 36:05)
two big things that they showed here was (36:03 - 36:08)
pokemon cafe remix (36:05 - 36:09)
i mean (36:08 - 36:12)
pokemon cafe mix the touch based puzzle (36:09 - 36:14)
game for the nintendo switch and mobile (36:12 - 36:16)
devices get is getting a revamp this (36:14 - 36:19)
fall along with a new name pokemon cafe (36:16 - 36:22)
remix updates will include new puzzle (36:19 - 36:24)
elements more pokemon new dress-up (36:22 - 36:26)
options and more ways of growing and (36:24 - 36:28)
developing your staff pokemon pokemon (36:26 - 36:30)
are now able to eat delicious meals (36:28 - 36:31)
prepared for them making them more (36:30 - 36:33)
friendly and more willing to become (36:31 - 36:35)
pokemon staff staff pokemon sorry new (36:33 - 36:38)
puzzles will make it easier to (36:35 - 36:41)
clear wait new puzzle skills will make (36:38 - 36:44)
it easier to clear puzzles which were (36:41 - 36:46)
introduced in cafe remix as well as the (36:44 - 36:48)
ability to combine megaphones to make (36:46 - 36:50)
them more powerful golden acorns (36:48 - 36:53)
collected uh in pokemon cafe mix will be (36:50 - 36:57)
able to be transferred to remix (36:53 - 36:58)
um (36:57 - 37:01)
wait do i have to install a new app (36:58 - 37:03)
no i think it's like when pokemon (37:01 - 37:05)
masters change their name it's just the (37:03 - 37:07)
app updated so why is it saying that the (37:05 - 37:09)
area (37:07 - 37:09)
because they do say it can be (37:13 - 37:16)
transferred (37:14 - 37:17)
which (37:16 - 37:20)
wouldn't matter if it was just an update (37:17 - 37:22)
to the game (37:20 - 37:24)
so again their wording in a lot of these (37:22 - 37:26)
things are like they leave a lot of (37:24 - 37:28)
questions (37:26 - 37:30)
that's okay guard escapes is done (37:28 - 37:34)
pokemon remix is the new one it does say (37:30 - 37:36)
free to start optional in-game purchases (37:34 - 37:37)
data charges may apply for mobile (37:36 - 37:40)
version users cannot transfer save data (37:37 - 37:42)
from the switch version to ios or (37:40 - 37:45)
android version or vice versa (37:42 - 37:47)
depending on the device or os users may (37:45 - 37:51)
not be able to use all features (37:47 - 37:52)
also (37:51 - 37:55)
it is in horizontal mode (37:52 - 37:58)
if they said cafe remix and the remix (37:55 - 38:00)
was them going from horizontal to (37:58 - 38:03)
vertical i would be i might be back in (38:00 - 38:05)
that would be it don't understand what (38:03 - 38:06)
do you mean back then you were never in (38:05 - 38:08)
in the first place (38:06 - 38:10)
level 12 in that game (38:08 - 38:14)
how hard is this how hard is this i (38:10 - 38:16)
don't want to do this why it's not okay (38:14 - 38:19)
first first off you can't play like this (38:16 - 38:21)
you are doing it just like that no (38:19 - 38:23)
because my hand my hand can't even reach (38:21 - 38:26)
50 and when i'm like this i can reach it (38:23 - 38:28)
all why are you so lazy to not used to i (38:26 - 38:32)
can't have this debate against (38:28 - 38:35)
the world cannot cater to your weirdness (38:32 - 38:38)
what i would play clash royale clash (38:35 - 38:40)
royale was a brilliant design game they (38:38 - 38:42)
put all four at the bottom i could reach (38:40 - 38:44)
that you only you never had to reach (38:42 - 38:46)
higher in the field well maybe if you (38:44 - 38:47)
threw like a fireball i wasn't that kind (38:46 - 38:49)
of player but you could just play it (38:47 - 38:52)
with one hand it was like that or you (38:49 - 38:54)
could do the really lazy way of like (38:52 - 38:56)
placing it on the ground and then just (38:54 - 38:59)
using one finger like this (38:56 - 39:00)
you can still place it on the floor and (38:59 - 39:02)
horizontal move and use one finger and (39:00 - 39:04)
do that and that will also capture this (39:02 - 39:07)
is a two finger game (39:04 - 39:10)
you need both hands (39:07 - 39:13)
your other hand needs to be occupied (39:10 - 39:16)
because idle hands are the devil's tool (39:13 - 39:18)
yeah that's why no yeah we don't want to (39:16 - 39:19)
hear about your depravity drink your (39:18 - 39:23)
water play your classroom (39:19 - 39:26)
water that vodka looks like water (39:23 - 39:29)
uh (39:26 - 39:31)
cafe mix is a bummer and pokemon shuffle (39:29 - 39:33)
is a better puzzle game stay tuned for (39:31 - 39:35)
my cafe remix weekly reports i'll give (39:33 - 39:38)
you guys (39:35 - 39:38)
go on (39:38 - 39:41)
long live cafe remix this is what i'll (39:39 - 39:43)
say about cafe roommates two things or (39:41 - 39:45)
cafe mix because remix is annoyed two (39:43 - 39:48)
things number one (39:45 - 39:51)
i can't remember number one number two (39:48 - 39:54)
if you thought pokemon go and pokemon (39:51 - 39:56)
masters nickel and dime do (39:54 - 40:00)
cafe mix is highway robbery like like (39:56 - 40:02)
the acorns in that game and what they (40:00 - 40:04)
want you to buy is (40:02 - 40:05)
actually (40:04 - 40:08)
atrocious you put i never put money into (40:05 - 40:10)
it so no one ever talks about it (40:08 - 40:11)
everyone always talks about how pokemon (40:10 - 40:13)
go nickels and dimes you and how gems (40:11 - 40:15)
are too expensive and in masters which (40:13 - 40:16)
is very truthy because people play those (40:15 - 40:19)
games (40:16 - 40:19)
the oh number one i'm gonna say because (40:19 - 40:23)
cafe remix is going in the way of (40:21 - 40:25)
pokemon duel (40:23 - 40:28)
not too long for this world (40:25 - 40:31)
there must be something somebody must be (40:28 - 40:34)
playing a cafe mix because oh (40:31 - 40:37)
dylan dylan is playing cafe mix rumble (40:34 - 40:40)
rush only lasted a year yeah (40:37 - 40:43)
and they they shut that down (40:40 - 40:46)
so i don't know what who's playing cafe (40:43 - 40:47)
remakes but (40:46 - 40:50)
i think i told you dylan is i think the (40:47 - 40:51)
actual problem that i have with cafe (40:50 - 40:54)
remix is it's it's not good enough to (40:51 - 40:56)
the two games that it looks like (40:54 - 40:58)
so like (40:56 - 41:00)
pokemon shuffle i think is just a better (40:58 - 41:02)
puzzle game (41:00 - 41:05)
um and it was on ios and it was on (41:02 - 41:07)
3ds and stuff (41:05 - 41:09)
and i really like shuffle a lot and then (41:07 - 41:11)
the other game that it actually looks (41:09 - 41:15)
like is disney tsum tsum (41:11 - 41:17)
and it's not as good as that either (41:15 - 41:20)
so it has like the tsum tsum that it (41:17 - 41:22)
looks like that i want it to be and tsum (41:20 - 41:24)
tsum is just a better (41:22 - 41:26)
how is it better (41:24 - 41:28)
qualify your statements (41:26 - 41:30)
because tsum tsum you don't have to like (41:28 - 41:33)
spin in this look so i i'm like level 12 (41:30 - 41:36)
or 13 and cafe makes and it's so far (41:33 - 41:38)
it's pretty easy but you have to like (41:36 - 41:40)
kind of like mix it well i get it (41:38 - 41:42)
because you're like mixing food you have (41:40 - 41:44)
to like mix it into (41:42 - 41:47)
into a way where it blows up blocks or (41:44 - 41:49)
it merges and then disappears in tsum (41:47 - 41:51)
tsum you're just matching lines it's (41:49 - 41:53)
like snake you're like oh i'm going to (41:51 - 41:55)
take all these mickey heads and i'm (41:53 - 41:56)
going to draw a line of all the mickey (41:55 - 41:57)
heads and then they're going to (41:56 - 41:59)
disappear (41:57 - 42:02)
so it's like you can't sore you can't (41:59 - 42:05)
move the characters in tsum tsum you're (42:02 - 42:07)
drawing the line and then they disappear (42:05 - 42:09)
and then the rest drop down so you're (42:07 - 42:10)
like i'm gonna clear this mickey and (42:09 - 42:12)
then donald's gonna drop down and now (42:10 - 42:14)
all the donald's are touching and then (42:12 - 42:15)
i'm gonna get rid of the donald's and (42:14 - 42:17)
then that drops down and then like oh (42:15 - 42:19)
buzz like yours now the buzz like you're (42:17 - 42:20)
at the top here was touching the buzz (42:19 - 42:22)
like you're at the bottom down here and (42:20 - 42:23)
now i can draw the buzz to get them and (42:22 - 42:26)
then when you do enough of that light (42:23 - 42:29)
year last year (42:26 - 42:29)
and then you get your little superpower (42:30 - 42:33)
then you hit the superpower and then (42:32 - 42:36)
things explode (42:33 - 42:37)
cafe (42:36 - 42:39)
mix never really had that it was just (42:37 - 42:42)
like okay grab like three (42:39 - 42:44)
chime echoes and like swirl them until (42:42 - 42:47)
they vanish like no (42:44 - 42:49)
what are you even talking about cafe (42:47 - 42:52)
remix is you you draw the line (42:49 - 42:54)
through all the things they just move (42:52 - 42:56)
with you and you can have them explode (42:54 - 42:59)
in specific ways it is basically how (42:56 - 43:00)
you're talking about tsum tsum know (42:59 - 43:02)
better version of tsum tsum it's not a (43:00 - 43:04)
better version (43:02 - 43:06)
because you actually can move them and (43:04 - 43:08)
have them to do i don't know why you (43:06 - 43:09)
want them (43:08 - 43:11)
because you're lazy you're lazy this is (43:09 - 43:14)
not a better game you're just lazy you (43:11 - 43:17)
won't turn your phone on the side (43:14 - 43:20)
i will take you to a round one (43:17 - 43:22)
we will we will play the tsum tsum and (43:20 - 43:24)
you will be like this is better it is (43:22 - 43:27)
better the soup soup is better then (43:24 - 43:30)
by making that statement there is no (43:27 - 43:31)
amount of dragging meat around one that (43:30 - 43:34)
will ever get me to agree that tsum tsum (43:31 - 43:36)
is better because you made that (43:34 - 43:38)
statement you know this about me you (43:36 - 43:40)
have doomed that game to forever be (43:38 - 43:43)
ignored by me (43:40 - 43:47)
disney soup soup is a better game is it (43:43 - 43:50)
a better game it's a far worse game it's (43:47 - 43:52)
awful i can't even believe they made it (43:50 - 43:55)
so bad (43:52 - 43:58)
give me your ticket but it's worse (43:55 - 44:00)
oh there's no debating it's not a cash (43:58 - 44:02)
grab that is true (44:00 - 44:04)
it is a hundred percent of cash we have (44:02 - 44:06)
been to the mall of america multiple (44:04 - 44:07)
times and that one tv dragged me into (44:06 - 44:10)
that arcade to show me tsum tsum (44:07 - 44:11)
it's not i don't want it because that's (44:10 - 44:13)
not it's not a it's nickelodeon they (44:11 - 44:15)

later in the year i mean we knew the (47:10 - 47:13)
games were going to come out in november (47:12 - 47:17)
regardless but what i will say is (47:13 - 47:19)
it was a good trailer they really (47:17 - 47:20)
they really knocked it out of the park (47:19 - 47:22)
with this trailer it kind of had a (47:20 - 47:24)
little of everything i jammed there were (47:22 - 47:26)
some flaws i wouldn't say knocked it out (47:24 - 47:29)
of the park but maybe hit an infield (47:26 - 47:31)
home run yeah they had an infield home (47:29 - 47:34)
run for sure it was a very very good (47:31 - 47:37)
trailer and (47:34 - 47:39)
i (47:37 - 47:40)
i don't know if people are selling the (47:39 - 47:42)
fence after this right like you're (47:40 - 47:44)
either you're not well (47:42 - 47:46)
everybody's always on the fence yes (47:44 - 47:49)
don't don't deny people's ability to sit (47:46 - 47:50)
on the fence (47:49 - 47:52)
uh you know i i personally hate sitting (47:50 - 47:54)
on a fence i like to you know be on one (47:52 - 47:56)
side of the other i i will say i did not (47:54 - 47:58)

it for the actual gameplay (48:16 - 48:20)
greg can you tell me the difference (48:21 - 48:24)
between the contest in gen 3 and the (48:22 - 48:26)
contest in gen 4 because they are (48:24 - 48:28)
different and i don't know why (48:26 - 48:30)
oh god (48:28 - 48:31)
uh (48:30 - 48:33)
i have to remember (48:31 - 48:35)
well in gen 3 they're contests and in (48:33 - 48:39)
gen 4 they're super contests (48:35 - 48:39)
you know (48:40 - 48:43)
gen 3 had (48:43 - 48:47)
the appeals round (48:47 - 48:50)
that affected things to fight and it (48:49 - 48:53)
only had an appeals round and then (48:50 - 48:55)
i think gen 4 it was a performance and (48:53 - 48:57)
an appeals run i have to hold on i have (48:55 - 48:59)
to remember all right you remember i'm (48:57 - 49:00)

different terrains ranging from still (49:52 - 49:56)
water caverns to volcanic landscapes (49:54 - 49:58)

some walls in the ground underground can (50:06 - 50:10)
be dug into by using a sledgehammer or (50:08 - 50:13)
pickaxe this was in the original by (50:10 - 50:14)
digging into them you can find things (50:13 - 50:15)
useful for your adventure such as (50:14 - 50:17)
fossils (50:15 - 50:19)
as well as new statues that can be added (50:17 - 50:23)
uh that have been added to these games (50:19 - 50:25)
i'm going to stop here real quick and (50:23 - 50:27)
say when i (50:25 - 50:30)
played original dive into pearl i was i (50:27 - 50:33)
don't know like 16 or 17. i did not (50:30 - 50:35)
spend a lot of (50:33 - 50:36)
time (50:35 - 50:39)
in the underground oh i did (50:36 - 50:43)
and so by playing through platinum (50:39 - 50:45)
a year ago and (50:43 - 50:47)
having you know 200 plus people in my (50:45 - 50:49)
twitch stream be like oh you got to do (50:47 - 50:52)
the underground it's so fun (50:49 - 50:54)
as an adult it was not that (50:52 - 50:56)
like it wasn't (50:54 - 50:59)
it's like a cute mini game but there's (50:56 - 51:01)
not (50:59 - 51:02)
like something there's supposed to be (51:01 - 51:05)
like online interactive component to it (51:02 - 51:06)
yeah (51:05 - 51:09)
stuff yeah (51:06 - 51:10)
there was like local where you could (51:09 - 51:13)
like run around and tag and stuff but (51:10 - 51:14)
the like the actual mini game of like (51:13 - 51:17)
digging up fossils like it's it's a good (51:14 - 51:19)
mini game yeah it's a frustrating mini (51:17 - 51:22)
game sometimes but yeah but when like (51:19 - 51:23)
but if you don't care about red gems or (51:22 - 51:27)
blue gems or green gems or (51:23 - 51:28)
you're in the one camp where you're like (51:27 - 51:29)
i only care about red gems because i (51:28 - 51:32)
need 500 of these gems to teach one (51:29 - 51:34)
pokemon one move (51:32 - 51:35)
uh (51:34 - 51:37)
it's just (51:35 - 51:38)
not (51:37 - 51:39)
a good (51:38 - 51:40)
loop (51:39 - 51:42)
like it's just not (51:40 - 51:43)
there's not enough i think i think (51:42 - 51:45)
here's the thing it almost feels like a (51:43 - 51:48)
bad pokemon masters pull where (51:45 - 51:49)
you're like (51:48 - 51:51)
yeah i like pulling in pokemon masters (51:49 - 51:53)
who doesn't like trying to get like 10 (51:51 - 51:54)
different characters and hopefully one (51:53 - 51:56)
of those characters is good (51:54 - 51:58)
but in like the underground it was like (51:56 - 52:00)
yeah i like digging but when you're only (51:58 - 52:04)
digging up like (52:00 - 52:04)
like gold nugget like it's just like is (52:05 - 52:10)
there anything else here (52:08 - 52:11)
yes i mean (52:10 - 52:13)
post game there were a lot of fossils in (52:11 - 52:15)
there which is what i spent all my time (52:13 - 52:17)
getting (52:15 - 52:17)
so the fact that they're adding like (52:18 - 52:22)
statues so so look i i'm i'm not (52:19 - 52:24)
complaining about (52:22 - 52:26)
like i want the i i just want that mini (52:24 - 52:27)
game to like (52:26 - 52:30)
feel more fun and i think the way you (52:27 - 52:32)
make that feel more fun is you add like (52:30 - 52:33)
exciting things like hey i want to keep (52:32 - 52:34)
digging over and over for like a (52:33 - 52:38)
rayquaza statue that sounds cool yeah i (52:34 - 52:39)
uh okay i'm gonna chairman i don't (52:38 - 52:41)
remember the differences between gen (52:39 - 52:42)
three and four i don't remember being (52:41 - 52:43)
that different (52:42 - 52:45)
honestly (52:43 - 52:48)
uh so i don't know how they're different (52:45 - 52:49)
let me be real honest (52:48 - 52:51)
i mean they're different in this game (52:49 - 52:53)
because it looks like (52:51 - 52:54)
there's (52:53 - 52:55)
uh (52:54 - 52:57)
in the remix it looks like they're doing (52:55 - 53:00)
like a rhythm section yeah and that (52:57 - 53:02)
wasn't it omega ruby off of sapphire (53:00 - 53:04)
there was no like ddr no there that's (53:02 - 53:07)
that's new it's i think (53:04 - 53:08)
i don't even think there was a rhythm (53:07 - 53:11)
really a rhythm section in the musicals (53:08 - 53:13)
that i remember in den (53:11 - 53:16)
five so that i think that's new to this (53:13 - 53:17)
system (53:16 - 53:20)
um i'm a little (53:17 - 53:20)
i am curious if secret bases will (53:23 - 53:27)
actually be (53:26 - 53:29)
like secret bases before where you can (53:27 - 53:31)
have other furniture and things because (53:29 - 53:33)
the way they make it sound is it's just (53:31 - 53:35)
for statues (53:33 - 53:37)
and nothing else and before you could (53:35 - 53:39)
make like obstacle courses and you could (53:37 - 53:41)
put traps in your (53:39 - 53:45)
secret base and people could meet you (53:41 - 53:47)
and here they kept saying it (53:45 - 53:48)
they kept making it sound that it was (53:47 - 53:52)
just for statues which makes me (53:48 - 53:54)
less interested in customizing my secret (53:52 - 53:58)
base well the statues determine what the (53:54 - 53:59)
hidden realms are that you (53:58 - 54:01)
walk in well (53:59 - 54:04)
i think it changes what pokemon appear (54:01 - 54:06)
but looking at the map for the hidden (54:04 - 54:08)
realms it looks like hideaways (54:06 - 54:12)
the hyda waves are specific to each area (54:08 - 54:14)
and you can control what pokemon appear (54:12 - 54:17)
but they are going to be (54:14 - 54:18)
like the first one you run into is the (54:17 - 54:20)
grass one and then there's a fire one (54:18 - 54:21)
and when you're under snow point it's (54:20 - 54:24)
the ice one like if you look at the map (54:21 - 54:27)
on the web page it seems that the hidden (54:24 - 54:29)
areas the highways or whatever they're (54:27 - 54:30)
called (54:29 - 54:31)
are (54:30 - 54:34)
don't change but the pokemon in it will (54:31 - 54:37)
change based off of your statue (54:34 - 54:40)
so um there's some screenshots here one (54:37 - 54:42)
of the screenshots is like an overhead (54:40 - 54:45)
animal crossing grid look and it says (54:42 - 54:48)
2 out of 18 statues placed in the room (54:45 - 54:50)
and then the second one shows (54:48 - 54:52)
a bunch of statues that has like a green (54:50 - 54:55)
charizard a green venusaur it has a (54:52 - 54:56)
snorlax on a stand (54:55 - 54:58)
it has a pacharisu and a krogan on a (54:56 - 55:01)
stand and then it has (54:58 - 55:03)
a non-green (55:01 - 55:06)
tertwig chimp chart and piplup not on (55:03 - 55:07)
stands (55:06 - 55:10)
so i don't know if i'm reading too much (55:07 - 55:12)
into that as like maybe the green (55:10 - 55:15)
charizard is more rare than a non-green (55:12 - 55:18)
charizard or maybe the snorlax on the (55:15 - 55:19)
stand is just rare because it's on a (55:18 - 55:20)
stand (55:19 - 55:23)
is there a snorlax not on a stand (55:20 - 55:26)
like why why is this venusaur green and (55:23 - 55:27)
the people (55:26 - 55:31)
before so it could be that the three (55:27 - 55:34)
starters are dolls and not statues (55:31 - 55:35)
like there's a lot i have a lot of (55:34 - 55:37)
questions also (55:35 - 55:40)
before you could only have one secret (55:37 - 55:41)
base (55:40 - 55:44)
so my question is is (55:41 - 55:46)
do the statue the statues (55:44 - 55:48)
one can you have multiple secret bases (55:46 - 55:50)
for each (55:48 - 55:52)
area (55:50 - 55:52)
or (55:52 - 55:55)
does your one secret base statue change (55:52 - 56:00)
the pokemon in all of the hidden areas (55:55 - 56:00)
because you can still only have one (56:01 - 56:05)
secret base yeah like i don't underst i (56:02 - 56:06)
don't know which way they're going (56:05 - 56:08)
you're gonna swap out those statues man (56:06 - 56:11)
yeah every time it says build that's a (56:08 - 56:12)
so it says build your very own secret (56:11 - 56:15)
base decorate it with pokemon statues (56:12 - 56:17)
you can use an item called the digger (56:15 - 56:19)
drill in the grand underground to build (56:17 - 56:21)
yourself a secret base within the walls (56:19 - 56:23)
pokemon statues you can find while (56:21 - 56:25)
digging fossils which (56:23 - 56:27)
that was not there before so again (56:25 - 56:28)
exciting (56:27 - 56:29)
um (56:28 - 56:31)
hopefully (56:29 - 56:33)
you can uh they can be placed where when (56:31 - 56:34)
it uh wherever you like inside your (56:33 - 56:36)
secret base so you can customize your (56:34 - 56:37)
own space (56:36 - 56:40)
it says adventure together with trainers (56:37 - 56:41)
all over the world in the ground (56:40 - 56:42)
underground (56:41 - 56:44)
you can integra interact with trainers (56:42 - 56:45)
all over the world through your nintendo (56:44 - 56:47)
switch systems local communication or (56:45 - 56:49)
online communication as well as together (56:47 - 56:51)
in the grand underground you can dig for (56:49 - 56:53)
fossils together with other trainers (56:51 - 56:56)
and they show two screenshots the top (56:53 - 57:00)
screenshot has two dawns and three (56:56 - 57:03)
whatever that dude's name is (57:00 - 57:03)
where's the male 1 (57:03 - 57:08)
not dawn i love not dawn three dogs (57:05 - 57:10)
eat no ethan is gold (57:08 - 57:14)
dagnabbit brendan no brendan is (57:10 - 57:14)
his (57:14 - 57:18)
what is the gen 4 dude's name (57:14 - 57:19)
clyde (57:18 - 57:21)
charles (57:19 - 57:22)
billy (57:21 - 57:24)
billy (57:22 - 57:26)
there's never been a billy (57:24 - 57:30)
billy esteban (57:26 - 57:30)
uh okay (57:31 - 57:34)
it is (57:33 - 57:37)
dawn and (57:34 - 57:38)
uh (57:37 - 57:41)
ethan is jen ethan and chris is gentoo (57:38 - 57:42)
jimbo (57:41 - 57:43)
is (57:42 - 57:45)
is gen three (57:43 - 57:48)
lucas and don is lucas how could we (57:45 - 57:50)
forget lucas okay and then the bottom (57:48 - 57:51)
screen shot shows (57:50 - 57:54)
hilbert and hilda are gen 5. (57:51 - 57:57)
bottom screen shot shows one dawn to (57:54 - 57:59)
lucas's so (57:57 - 58:00)
lucas (57:59 - 58:04)
lukai lukai (58:00 - 58:04)
ludicolos (58:04 - 58:08)
i think the the hideaway okay so the (58:06 - 58:11)
hideaway stuff is (58:08 - 58:11)
is like them (58:12 - 58:15)
acknowledging knowing wanting to put (58:16 - 58:24)
overworld pokemon into the game yeah (58:19 - 58:26)
like like i was excited for that because (58:24 - 58:29)
you see this little chibi (58:26 - 58:31)
side duck walking around and this little (58:29 - 58:33)
b doof and this like gastrodon like (58:31 - 58:35)
slugging along (58:33 - 58:37)
and then you see your character kind of (58:35 - 58:38)
run past those (58:37 - 58:41)
um (58:38 - 58:41)
and i will die on this hill (58:41 - 58:46)
i think random encounters are bad (58:43 - 58:49)
they're not fun anymore (58:46 - 58:51)
yes i mean as a person who has a show (58:49 - 58:53)
about random encounters i'm still really (58:51 - 58:54)
liking them (58:53 - 58:56)
i think what they did in certain shield (58:54 - 58:57)
is a perfect balance in the wild area (58:56 - 58:59)
where there was some (58:57 - 59:01)
like the grass could shake you could run (58:59 - 59:03)
up to it and but you could see all the (59:01 - 59:05)
pokemon like (59:03 - 59:06)
like i think sword and shield had such a (59:05 - 59:09)
good balance and (59:06 - 59:11)
i get it you know if they can't do if (59:09 - 59:13)
they didn't want to or they they real (59:11 - 59:14)
they wanted to keep the random (59:13 - 59:17)
encounters for the integrity of faithful (59:14 - 59:19)
remakes (59:17 - 59:22)
yeah but i i do love i think there's a (59:19 - 59:24)
good compromise to have this area (59:22 - 59:26)
um who knows if it's going to be like (59:24 - 59:27)
let's go where like they're shining in (59:26 - 59:30)
the overworld or they're not but (59:27 - 59:31)
um (59:30 - 59:32)
i wonder if this is going to be also a (59:31 - 59:35)
way of shiny hunting (59:32 - 59:35)
i'm sure it is (59:35 - 59:39)
like are there shiny (59:37 - 59:42)
improving statues (59:39 - 59:46)
yeah or you need to have (59:42 - 59:48)
all the rarish statues that have i don't (59:46 - 59:50)
know like like have an increased shiny (59:48 - 59:51)
encounter it'd be cool they're not even (59:50 - 59:53)
increased but like what if you know cast (59:51 - 59:55)
forms of one percent and if you want to (59:53 - 59:57)
increase the cast form (59:55 - 60:00)
cast forms in this game yeah yeah do you (59:57 - 60:02)
do we want to talk about the pokemon (60:00 - 60:03)
they showed and what that meant for the (60:02 - 60:05)
pokedex (60:03 - 60:06)
uh (60:05 - 60:10)
the next thing on our list was contest (60:06 - 60:11)
okay (60:10 - 60:14)
so is that a no (60:11 - 60:16)
do you want to come back to the pokemon (60:14 - 60:17)
stuff (60:16 - 60:19)
i think i think we have to get through (60:17 - 60:20)
the let's get through everything all (60:19 - 60:21)
right (60:20 - 60:22)
um (60:21 - 60:24)
[Music] (60:22 - 60:26)
fine super contests were popular (60:24 - 60:29)
performances in cinema each by four (60:26 - 60:30)
performers and their pokemon who work (60:29 - 60:32)
together to show off their performance (60:30 - 60:33)
skills during the show you can dress up (60:32 - 60:35)
your pokemon in your favorite outfits (60:33 - 60:37)
and your pokemon will dance making it an (60:35 - 60:40)
uh altogether a different experience (60:37 - 60:42)
from the usual battles of strength up to (60:40 - 60:44)
four people can't participate so show (60:42 - 60:45)
off your best performance with your (60:44 - 60:48)
friends to really wow the crowd super (60:45 - 60:49)
contests are divided into five (60:48 - 60:51)
categories coolness cuteness beauty (60:49 - 60:54)
toughness and cleverness which (60:51 - 60:56)
each has different ranks of normal great (60:54 - 60:58)
ultra and master (60:56 - 60:59)
super contests are judged based on (60:58 - 61:02)
visual evaluation dance evaluation and (60:59 - 61:05)
move evaluation and you can receive hype (61:02 - 61:06)
points (61:05 - 61:08)
based on your evaluations and if the (61:06 - 61:10)
combined total of all four (61:08 - 61:12)
performers height points reached a (61:10 - 61:15)
target's score the show will be declared (61:12 - 61:18)
a success (61:15 - 61:18)
i i'll give it a chance (61:22 - 61:27)
i don't think i did any contest in gen 3 (61:24 - 61:30)
or omega ruby or (61:27 - 61:31)
i (61:30 - 61:34)
you had to do one yeah (61:31 - 61:36)
yes i (61:34 - 61:39)
do enjoy (61:36 - 61:42)
contests i think it is i think (61:39 - 61:45)
like the the the puffin and maxing out (61:42 - 61:47)
the beauty or whatever toughness that's (61:45 - 61:51)
like that's that that that's kind of fun (61:47 - 61:53)
what i'm what's interesting is they (61:51 - 61:55)
added an entire new section with the (61:53 - 61:56)
move (61:55 - 61:58)
the dance section between visual and (61:56 - 62:00)
move (61:58 - 62:03)
like there's a rhythm game in the game (62:00 - 62:05)
that is different from (62:03 - 62:08)
the two standard perks which is how well (62:05 - 62:10)
have you raised this pokemon and dressed (62:08 - 62:13)
it so the visual beauty which is like (62:10 - 62:15)
you just get judged (62:13 - 62:16)
and then (62:15 - 62:18)
the move part was always there which was (62:16 - 62:21)
use moves and unique ways to (62:18 - 62:23)
debuff other pokemon to buff yourself to (62:21 - 62:26)
get appeal points and those are still (62:23 - 62:27)
here in the visual and move parts as far (62:26 - 62:30)
as i can tell yeah it's the dance part (62:27 - 62:31)
that i think is going to be (62:30 - 62:34)
controversial because it is a rhythm (62:31 - 62:35)
based game (62:34 - 62:37)
and therefore somewhat (62:35 - 62:40)
dexterity based i'm real bad at rhythm (62:37 - 62:43)
games that said contests are completely (62:40 - 62:45)
optional and you never have to do them (62:43 - 62:47)
so i don't think it's that big of a deal (62:45 - 62:49)
i don't think so either um i mean like (62:47 - 62:50)
if (62:49 - 62:52)
you don't know game freak did make a (62:50 - 62:54)
rhythm game it was called harman knight (62:52 - 62:57)
and it came out on the 3ds (62:54 - 62:58)
gosh (62:57 - 63:01)
seven years ago or something (62:58 - 63:03)
i think it was longer than that wasn't (63:01 - 63:05)
that uh but it was called harmonite (63:03 - 63:07)
and it had (63:05 - 63:09)
no pokemon stuff in it except i think (63:07 - 63:11)
there was a pokemon song you could do (63:09 - 63:13)
near the end that you can unlock (63:11 - 63:16)
but (63:13 - 63:18)
yeah i mean it (63:16 - 63:20)
comes down to whether or not you like (63:18 - 63:22)
rhythm games i'd be curious on that (63:20 - 63:24)
in 2013 (63:22 - 63:26)
so eight years ago (63:24 - 63:29)
i'd be curious if the ribbons line up (63:26 - 63:31)
with the ribbons in gen 4 because there (63:29 - 63:34)
was a lot of gen 3 ribbons that were (63:31 - 63:37)
similar in ruby and sapphire and then (63:34 - 63:40)
similar in omega ruby but omega ruby (63:37 - 63:41)
added like (63:40 - 63:44)
10 more new ones or something like that (63:41 - 63:46)
and they really (63:44 - 63:49)
really went all in on stickers (63:46 - 63:51)
yeah speaking of stickers use capsule (63:49 - 63:54)
decorations to create effects according (63:51 - 63:55)
to your taste (63:54 - 63:57)
using capsule decorations you can place (63:55 - 63:58)
stickers to customize the effects and (63:57 - 64:00)
appear when a pokemon comes out of the (63:58 - 64:02)
pokeball for battles or super contests (64:00 - 64:04)
with over 90 different stickers you can (64:02 - 64:06)
customize your ball capsules with (64:04 - 64:09)
fluttering effects flower pedals raging (64:06 - 64:10)
flames (64:09 - 64:11)
you can buy stickers in the shop but you (64:10 - 64:13)
can also get them in other ways by (64:11 - 64:14)
defeating gym leaders or being (64:13 - 64:18)
successful in super contest shows (64:14 - 64:20)
that's how you get the rare stickers (64:18 - 64:22)
yeah where you can flex in your (64:20 - 64:26)
non-ranked ladder battles (64:22 - 64:28)
yes (64:26 - 64:30)
again i wasn't super into st maybe i was (64:28 - 64:32)
just an edge lord 16 year old i was like (64:30 - 64:33)
you just want to play through pokemon (64:32 - 64:36)
maybe you were just one battle yes you (64:33 - 64:40)
were you absolutely were an edge lord 16 (64:36 - 64:41)
year old you had (64:40 - 64:44)
i did have a chain wallet yeah but (64:41 - 64:46)
i still don't know what your hairstyle (64:44 - 64:47)
was so i don't know how committed i i (64:46 - 64:49)
had a faux hawk (64:47 - 64:53)
oh god why do i know you i this (64:49 - 64:56)
look he's not a child any longer (64:53 - 64:58)
yeah i've only gotten (64:56 - 65:00)
um (64:58 - 65:01)
you they got rid of the letters right (65:00 - 65:03)
there's no way (65:01 - 65:05)
because in the original yeah no words (65:03 - 65:06)
yeah (65:05 - 65:08)
i guarantee they got rid of the letters (65:06 - 65:10)
because that (65:08 - 65:11)
that (65:10 - 65:13)
was bad (65:11 - 65:15)
and since it's now online (65:13 - 65:18)
it's real bad so they got rid of the (65:15 - 65:20)
letters and they just have (65:18 - 65:24)
pretty stickers like stars and (65:20 - 65:26)
conventions (65:24 - 65:27)
petals (65:26 - 65:29)
and hearts (65:27 - 65:31)
but you can add up to 20 (65:29 - 65:34)
which seems like a lot (65:31 - 65:35)
yeah i (65:34 - 65:37)
like the little like grid thing they (65:35 - 65:38)
showed (65:37 - 65:40)
what's interesting is it's got a you can (65:38 - 65:43)
either do it in 2d mode or 3d mode so (65:40 - 65:45)
you can either do it on a grid (65:43 - 65:49)
or freestyle in 3d mode (65:45 - 65:51)
and (65:49 - 65:51)
are we assuming that where you place it (65:52 - 65:56)
is where it will appear in front or (65:54 - 65:58)
behind or below that's how it was so (65:56 - 65:59)
that's how it worked in the original (65:58 - 66:02)
yeah yeah but it i mean like it was so (65:59 - 66:03)
small that it was like really hard to (66:02 - 66:06)
tell yeah i have a feeling it will not (66:03 - 66:08)
be as hard to tell on this one but also (66:06 - 66:10)
it's it's it's like what a less than a (66:08 - 66:12)
one second animation like it goes so (66:10 - 66:14)
fast that it's it would be hard to tell (66:12 - 66:16)
anyways (66:14 - 66:18)
i could see that confetti coming out (66:16 - 66:20)
behind that yeah i mean yeah you can see (66:18 - 66:23)
it tell this to the stars and square (66:20 - 66:24)
shiny people (66:23 - 66:25)
yeah (66:24 - 66:27)
you're right i'm just saying that like (66:25 - 66:29)
if you put the little lightning bolt in (66:27 - 66:32)
in the (66:29 - 66:34)
center bottom right square is somebody (66:32 - 66:37)
gonna notice if like you put it one (66:34 - 66:39)
square over there is someone who's only (66:37 - 66:43)
art is the art of pokeball customization (66:39 - 66:45)
like wow (66:43 - 66:47)
that effect was incredible but you (66:45 - 66:49)
should have just moved that you should (66:47 - 66:50)
have moved that lighting bolt two pixels (66:49 - 66:51)
over it would have been a much it would (66:50 - 66:53)
have been like you don't know how i mean (66:51 - 66:54)
it looks good in the picture it looks (66:53 - 66:57)
like you can tell because pachariso's (66:54 - 66:59)
got those things over and if that lower (66:57 - 67:01)
left-hand one was up a little i'd like (66:59 - 67:03)
it better (67:01 - 67:05)
walk around with your favorite pokemon (67:03 - 67:06)
once you've progressed through a certain (67:05 - 67:08)
point in the game you can choose one (67:06 - 67:10)
pokemon that you have befriended at a (67:08 - 67:12)
time to walk behind you (67:10 - 67:14)
any pokemon that appears in those games (67:12 - 67:16)
can walk with you so choose a favorite (67:14 - 67:18)
to travel through the center region so (67:16 - 67:20)
as you visit lots of places and make (67:18 - 67:23)
memories together (67:20 - 67:25)
now i don't know if uh (67:23 - 67:27)
our audience remembers but there was a (67:25 - 67:29)
place in diamond and pearl and platinum (67:27 - 67:31)
called an amidity (67:29 - 67:35)
midi park amity park amity park amity (67:31 - 67:35)
park (67:35 - 67:37)
um which was (67:35 - 67:40)
after the fourth gym i think maybe third (67:37 - 67:43)
everything's after the third (67:40 - 67:43)
what is the center town is that heart (67:43 - 67:46)
home (67:45 - 67:48)
where fantina is supposed to be but (67:46 - 67:50)
she's it's there it's yeah it's in the (67:48 - 67:52)
same town as fantina (67:50 - 67:54)
and heart home isn't it you mean she's (67:52 - 67:55)
not there (67:54 - 67:56)
she's not that the first time you get (67:55 - 67:58)
there oh yeah it's heart home city she's (67:56 - 68:00)
not there the first time yeah avenue (67:58 - 68:02)
square is (68:00 - 68:02)
uh (68:02 - 68:04)
in that city it's the north section and (68:02 - 68:06)
you could only bring (68:04 - 68:08)
cute pokemon yeah you can only bring (68:06 - 68:10)
like eight pokemon in and then in (68:08 - 68:13)
platinum it like upped it to 20 pokemon (68:10 - 68:14)
or something yeah i got real mad what (68:13 - 68:16)
they're considered cute (68:14 - 68:17)
so you could you could walk around like (68:16 - 68:21)
a pikachu or a bee doof or i think like (68:17 - 68:22)
a cricket (68:21 - 68:24)
and you could just (68:22 - 68:26)
huh (68:24 - 68:27)
that wasn't allowed in there i think b (68:26 - 68:28)
do fuzz (68:27 - 68:30)
i am looking at pokemon permitted (68:28 - 68:32)
pikachu give me the list harry psyduck (68:30 - 68:33)
turtwig (68:32 - 68:36)
grottle totera chimchar monferno (68:33 - 68:39)
infernip piplup princeplup napoleon (68:36 - 68:44)
pachurisu drifloon banari happini (68:39 - 68:46)
and then after the next national decks (68:44 - 68:50)
jigglypuff torchic shroomish and skitty (68:46 - 68:50)
so you could obviously you could have (68:51 - 68:56)
pikachu follow you in pokemon yellow (68:54 - 69:00)
yeah but this that the uh amidity amity (68:56 - 69:02)
park sorry is like the first time you (69:00 - 69:03)
could pick a pokemon and walk around (69:02 - 69:04)
with it and it really didn't do anything (69:03 - 69:08)
but it was cute so (69:04 - 69:11)
in a 2021 game (69:08 - 69:12)
where (69:11 - 69:14)
keem freak and the pokemon company knows (69:12 - 69:17)
that people like pokemon following (69:14 - 69:19)
behind you (69:17 - 69:22)
what is this park going to be doing i (69:19 - 69:24)
would maybe assume that the park is what (69:22 - 69:26)
unlocks the following pokemon but they (69:24 - 69:29)
show the trailer very early on pokemon (69:26 - 69:31)
following you obviously you can (69:29 - 69:32)
backtrack well (69:31 - 69:34)
yeah i don't think it's very early on (69:32 - 69:37)
they show cities where you're in but not (69:34 - 69:39)
when you get it i would (69:37 - 69:42)
imagine it is (69:39 - 69:44)
in heart home city where (69:42 - 69:47)
you get that ability (69:44 - 69:48)
i'm just curious what this little park (69:47 - 69:50)
is going to be doing now there's a lot (69:48 - 69:51)
of questions like integration with (69:50 - 69:53)
pokemon go there you go biggest the (69:51 - 69:56)
biggest thing in the park was (69:53 - 69:59)
you could get (69:56 - 70:00)
you could find like items on the ground (69:59 - 70:02)
you could find atoms on the ground they (70:00 - 70:03)
would randomly pick things up and (70:02 - 70:06)
imagining that part is (70:03 - 70:10)
staying and they probably got rid of the (70:06 - 70:13)
cuteness requirement and just said here (70:10 - 70:15)
come into the park your pokemon will (70:13 - 70:16)
follow you around and then you can pick (70:15 - 70:18)
things up (70:16 - 70:19)
uh (70:18 - 70:21)
and then (70:19 - 70:21)
uh from that po point forward your (70:21 - 70:26)
pokemon can follow you in the over world (70:24 - 70:29)
i don't even remember i think mostly you (70:26 - 70:31)
just got contest (70:29 - 70:33)
items in the park (70:31 - 70:35)
i want to say there was a tm hidden in (70:33 - 70:37)
one of the little caves (70:35 - 70:38)
that were like not caves but like little (70:37 - 70:41)
tree house things that they had (70:38 - 70:43)
and i thought you could pick up like (70:41 - 70:44)
a power (70:43 - 70:45)
were hidden in there the spooky plate (70:44 - 70:48)
was hidden in there and the amulet coin (70:45 - 70:51)
was hidden in there (70:48 - 70:51)
but that's exciting i mean like people (70:51 - 70:55)
freaked out when (70:54 - 70:56)
walking pokemon (70:55 - 70:58)
came (70:56 - 71:00)
back like (70:58 - 71:02)
at this point it's like a standard i (71:00 - 71:04)
feel like yeah (71:02 - 71:06)
i don't know why it was ever i don't (71:04 - 71:08)
know it's just (71:06 - 71:09)
it doesn't like make or break a video (71:08 - 71:10)
game (71:09 - 71:12)
in my opinion like i can't imagine (71:10 - 71:14)
somebody's like oh man diamond pulls my (71:12 - 71:16)
favorite game ever but if there's no (71:14 - 71:18)
walking pokemon i'm not buying it like i (71:16 - 71:21)
i'm sure that one person exists (71:18 - 71:23)
in an infinite universe anything is (71:21 - 71:26)
possible but (71:23 - 71:30)
glee blorb is like no (71:26 - 71:30)
but it's always funny because i'll post (71:31 - 71:36)
like i don't know clips or tutorials on (71:33 - 71:38)
youtube or instagram or whatever tic tac (71:36 - 71:40)
and then people will be like how did you (71:38 - 71:41)
get the pokemon to follow you in sword (71:40 - 71:42)
and shield and it's like (71:41 - 71:43)
oh you (71:42 - 71:45)
must uh (71:43 - 71:47)
missed the dlc part of this game man (71:45 - 71:51)
it's the dlc (71:47 - 71:51)
uh interact with trainers around the (71:51 - 71:55)
world in the union room union room is a (71:53 - 71:57)
facility where you can enjoy (71:55 - 72:00)
battling and trading with other pokemon (71:57 - 72:01)
and trainers to the nintendo switch (72:00 - 72:04)
system or other communication (72:01 - 72:04)
in a local room trainers can gather by (72:05 - 72:10)
local communication to enjoy trading (72:08 - 72:12)
battling and other activities (72:10 - 72:14)
in the global room trainers can use the (72:12 - 72:15)
online communication to gather in a (72:14 - 72:17)
single room for trading battling online (72:15 - 72:19)
communications (72:17 - 72:19)
ah (72:19 - 72:21)
now (72:19 - 72:22)
again i don't know if a lot of people (72:21 - 72:24)
remember this but back in the day when (72:22 - 72:26)
you joined the union room you would be (72:24 - 72:29)
randomly assigned an npc as your (72:26 - 72:30)
character (72:29 - 72:33)
and sometimes it wasn't what you would (72:30 - 72:35)
want like i don't want to be the hiker i (72:33 - 72:38)
don't want to be the swimsuit guy (72:35 - 72:40)
and so i'm looking at screenshots and (72:38 - 72:42)
you can see the hiker (72:40 - 72:44)
you can see the like (72:42 - 72:47)
country girl um you can see like the old (72:44 - 72:49)
lady and like the little psychic dude (72:47 - 72:51)
with like the hair swoop and they always (72:49 - 72:54)
have like an abra or kadabra (72:51 - 72:54)
are (72:55 - 72:59)
is it randomly a and then you see lucas (72:56 - 73:01)
well you see yourself out i saw yourself (72:59 - 73:03)
as the character as yourself and how you (73:01 - 73:05)
appear to other people (73:03 - 73:08)
right that was i remember like that (73:05 - 73:09)
because when diamond pro came out that (73:08 - 73:10)
was the first time i was on like four we (73:09 - 73:13)
all can't be the same people (73:10 - 73:15)
well no but that (73:13 - 73:17)
this leads into like the added character (73:15 - 73:18)
customization in this game (73:17 - 73:20)
not enough (73:18 - 73:21)
so are they ignoring the character (73:20 - 73:23)
customization (73:21 - 73:26)
customization for the youtube how the (73:23 - 73:28)
character customization works (73:26 - 73:29)
yeah they showed a little bit of it (73:28 - 73:31)
you're only getting full outfits it's (73:29 - 73:34)
not like i got the leather exactly sure (73:31 - 73:37)
that did you look at the menu yeah it (73:34 - 73:39)
said this style that style that style (73:37 - 73:41)
that style it did not say (73:39 - 73:43)
leather jacket (73:41 - 73:45)
jeans leather jacket (73:43 - 73:48)
like there is no there is no split tabs (73:45 - 73:50)
on this you're missing the really (73:48 - 73:52)
important thing for faithfulness which i (73:50 - 73:54)
find hilarious which was (73:52 - 73:56)
there were literally two rooms (73:54 - 73:59)
and you walked into i'm gonna walk into (73:56 - 74:01)
the local room i'm going to walk into (73:59 - 74:03)
the global room yeah rather than walking (74:01 - 74:05)
into a room and then having a menu come (74:03 - 74:08)
up that say do you want the local room (74:05 - 74:08)
because that that functionality never (74:11 - 74:16)
had any problems ever (74:13 - 74:18)
yes they did they did they did show (74:16 - 74:20)
character customization well hold on (74:18 - 74:21)
we'll circle back they showed character (74:20 - 74:23)
customization it says you will be able (74:21 - 74:25)
to buy and change outfits at the (74:23 - 74:28)
metronome style shop in vailstone city i (74:25 - 74:30)
just want to say one thing (74:28 - 74:33)
in diamond pearl and platinum you could (74:30 - 74:35)
pick your (74:33 - 74:37)
permanent trainer style (74:35 - 74:41)
you had to go talk to a specific (74:37 - 74:43)
person in orburg city (74:41 - 74:45)
and they would let you pick how you (74:43 - 74:47)
appeared to other people well which (74:45 - 74:49)
trainer type you appeared at yes yes oh (74:47 - 74:51)
i see i see i didn't know that yep (74:49 - 74:54)
so in that one and then they also did (74:51 - 74:55)
that in (74:54 - 74:57)
heart gold soul silver i think it was (74:55 - 75:00)
only random in (74:57 - 75:03)
gen 3. (75:00 - 75:03)
they (75:06 - 75:11)
showed outfits although will is right (75:08 - 75:12)
they only showed like four outfits and (75:11 - 75:14)
it looked like full outfits and the (75:12 - 75:16)
website is saying you can buy and change (75:14 - 75:19)
outfits at the metronome style shop in (75:16 - 75:21)
valeson city if you were curious what (75:19 - 75:23)
that means (75:21 - 75:25)
the metronome style shop is where the (75:23 - 75:27)
game corner used to be yeah (75:25 - 75:29)
so goodbye (75:27 - 75:31)
hello (75:29 - 75:34)
close they only showed four outfits they (75:31 - 75:35)
were complete outfits we don't know if (75:34 - 75:37)
there's more we don't know if (75:35 - 75:39)
you can customize these outfits (75:37 - 75:41)
the outfits they showed were very cute (75:39 - 75:43)
though like they were all really good (75:41 - 75:46)
outfits everyday style eevee jacket (75:43 - 75:50)
style winter style leather jacket style (75:46 - 75:53)
um so uh yeah we we don't know that uh (75:50 - 75:54)
it it's cool you can pick your skin (75:53 - 75:57)
color um (75:54 - 75:58)
like this was this was one of my (75:57 - 76:01)
complaints for dot for omega ruby alpha (75:58 - 76:02)
sapphire that we've talked about (76:01 - 76:04)
that why didn't they just let me pick (76:02 - 76:06)
who i could be why don't they just have (76:04 - 76:08)
a couple outfits this game has done that (76:06 - 76:10)
there's another podcast that would have (76:08 - 76:12)
said i can't believe there's a single (76:10 - 76:13)
person in the world that looks at these (76:12 - 76:15)
games and says i can't customize my (76:13 - 76:18)
character that's a no it's not gonna be (76:15 - 76:20)
like yes and i'm sure that podcast is (76:18 - 76:22)
done by three white dudes that are like (76:20 - 76:25)
who cares about being your skin color (76:22 - 76:27)
there are plenty of people of color that (76:25 - 76:30)
would kill to actually have some sort of (76:27 - 76:32)
reference in my day you couldn't be a (76:30 - 76:35)
girl so that's true yeah (76:32 - 76:38)
so it's a work in progress (76:35 - 76:39)
uh (76:38 - 76:40)
do we now want to talk about (76:39 - 76:44)
wild area and the pokedex yeah (76:40 - 76:46)
so (76:44 - 76:48)
ferrari's like oh i wonder what the if (76:46 - 76:49)
the national decks and stuff is going to (76:48 - 76:50)
be there (76:49 - 76:52)
uh (76:50 - 76:55)
going by past games and what they showed (76:52 - 76:58)
in the wild area they showed pokemon in (76:55 - 77:00)
the wild area that did not appear (76:58 - 77:03)
anywhere in any of the diamond pearl or (77:00 - 77:05)
platinum pokemon (77:03 - 77:06)
are we talking about highlights yeah the (77:05 - 77:08)
hideaways the hideaways so in the (77:06 - 77:10)
hideaways in the hidden realms in the (77:08 - 77:12)
shadow realms (77:10 - 77:16)
uh there's a number number was not in (77:12 - 77:18)
any of the pokedexes if i remember (77:16 - 77:21)
correctly and it's in this game so (77:18 - 77:22)
[Music] (77:21 - 77:24)
like speculation about what will be and (77:22 - 77:26)
won't be in the pokedex and sort of out (77:24 - 77:28)
the window right now because we don't (77:26 - 77:31)
saw something i need to go back (77:28 - 77:32)
and look (77:31 - 77:33)
at (77:32 - 77:37)
one of the screenshots (77:33 - 77:40)
of that it was the ice area and i was (77:37 - 77:44)
like this is kind of suss (77:40 - 77:44)
where okay where was that in (77:45 - 77:49)
and like there's a centered in there and (77:48 - 77:51)
a pretty sure center (77:49 - 77:53)
isn't in (77:51 - 77:57)
i i still find it hard to believe (77:53 - 78:00)
although unbelievable nonetheless (77:57 - 78:02)
that they would release a game after (78:00 - 78:04)
sword and shield (78:02 - 78:06)
and that game wouldn't have (78:04 - 78:08)
some of the most popular pokemon (78:06 - 78:11)
currently on people's minds like score (78:08 - 78:13)
bunny grooky (78:11 - 78:15)
um for me cramer ant (78:13 - 78:17)
although i would you know as much as i (78:15 - 78:18)
like cramer ant like cramerran is (78:17 - 78:20)
featured in a lot of merchandise and a (78:18 - 78:22)
lot of um (78:20 - 78:24)
it was in the movie and it like whether (78:22 - 78:26)
or not the us likes cramer we definitely (78:24 - 78:27)
know the people over in japan like (78:26 - 78:29)
cramer ant so i do (78:27 - 78:30)
think concentrate it's not in the (78:29 - 78:32)
pokedex for diamond pearl or platinum (78:30 - 78:34)
also so we already have a couple of (78:32 - 78:38)
pokemons shown on screen (78:34 - 78:39)
that aren't that are in the hidden (78:38 - 78:42)
hideaways that aren't in the old pokedex (78:39 - 78:43)
so (78:42 - 78:46)
all guesses about what this pokedex will (78:43 - 78:47)
be (78:46 - 78:49)
are off the table because we don't know (78:47 - 78:50)
what they're doing (78:49 - 78:53)
yeah we don't know if like the hideaways (78:50 - 78:55)
have gen a pokemon right and that's (78:53 - 78:57)
something things unlock (78:55 - 78:59)
post (78:57 - 79:02)
post game like do these only appear when (78:59 - 79:04)
you get shadows that they only like with (79:02 - 79:06)
certain sizes you get post game like we (79:04 - 79:07)
don't (79:06 - 79:10)
know but i think people who (79:07 - 79:12)
are making declarations about this will (79:10 - 79:15)
for sure be a national dex or this will (79:12 - 79:17)
for sure only be the platinum decks we (79:15 - 79:22)
have no clue there is not a single (79:17 - 79:23)
there is no way (79:22 - 79:27)
that they released sword and shield with (79:23 - 79:29)
missing 200 pokemon and then a non-game (79:27 - 79:32)
freak game comes along and includes all (79:29 - 79:35)
800 some pokemon there's not as it's not (79:32 - 79:37)
happening there's no way but we don't (79:35 - 79:39)
like we don't know what the pokedex is (79:37 - 79:41)
gonna look like at this point like (79:39 - 79:43)
we can assume because they've stated (79:41 - 79:45)
going forward from sword and shield not (79:43 - 79:47)
every game will have all pokemon in it (79:45 - 79:49)
yeah so it is unlikely that this game (79:47 - 79:52)
will have all pokemon in it (79:49 - 79:54)
well well you so you brought that up and (79:52 - 79:56)
i was going to save this for the arceus (79:54 - 79:59)
conversation but like (79:56 - 79:59)
like like they they (79:59 - 80:05)
they did 28 minutes of pokemon news and (80:02 - 80:08)
then the last like 14 seconds they're (80:05 - 80:10)
like by the way by the way (80:08 - 80:14)
uh ranked battles will not take place in (80:10 - 80:16)
these two new games they will continue (80:14 - 80:19)
taking place in sword and shield goodbye (80:16 - 80:21)
and then they ended it (80:19 - 80:22)
which is like (80:21 - 80:25)
fine yeah but (80:22 - 80:28)
i i just can't imagine and i just want (80:25 - 80:29)
to lay this out here i just want people (80:28 - 80:31)
to think about this (80:29 - 80:33)
that there's no way that (80:31 - 80:36)
diamond and pearl have all 800 pokemon (80:33 - 80:38)
there's just no way there's no way (80:36 - 80:41)
that legends of arceus and this hasn't (80:38 - 80:42)
even been brought up there's no way that (80:41 - 80:45)
game has all 800 pokemon either no oh (80:42 - 80:47)
heck no heck no we're going to be lucky (80:45 - 80:49)
if that game has like 200 pokemon but (80:47 - 80:51)
like (80:49 - 80:52)
somehow (80:51 - 80:56)
the narrative around arceus is like that (80:52 - 80:58)
that's not even a consideration like (80:56 - 80:59)
people are looking at arceus and they're (80:58 - 81:01)
like this is a new style of pokemon game (80:59 - 81:04)
i want it it's not i'm interested in (81:01 - 81:05)
this pokemon game but it better have all (81:04 - 81:07)
the pokemon like that's not even on the (81:05 - 81:09)
table for most people or the (81:07 - 81:11)
conversation like it was for sword and (81:09 - 81:13)
shield so we have we have four games on (81:11 - 81:15)
the nintendo switch (81:13 - 81:17)
from that are pokemon games we have (81:15 - 81:19)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee has (81:17 - 81:22)
153 pokemon we have diamond and pearl (81:19 - 81:24)
let's just assume that it's gonna have (81:22 - 81:27)
490 whatever pokemon that was in (81:24 - 81:29)
platinum or whatever it was (81:27 - 81:31)
i think (81:29 - 81:33)
490 the first time it was 493 for (81:31 - 81:35)
platinum (81:33 - 81:37)
uh we have arceus which (81:35 - 81:39)
lucky if that has like 400 pokemon like (81:37 - 81:41)
i don't think so but (81:39 - 81:44)
so why (81:41 - 81:46)
do people just assume that because of (81:44 - 81:47)
that message (81:46 - 81:48)
ranked battles will continue in sword (81:47 - 81:50)
and shield they're gonna add the last (81:48 - 81:53)
200 pokemon why why would they do that (81:50 - 81:54)
so (81:53 - 81:56)
i i do think (81:54 - 81:59)
because (81:56 - 82:00)
there's a couple of things that make me (81:59 - 82:02)
think that there's going to be some sort (82:00 - 82:05)
of update coming from (82:02 - 82:07)
for sword and shield (82:05 - 82:08)
one because i don't think we're getting (82:07 - 82:12)
gen 9 until 2023 so we will not have you (82:08 - 82:13)
don't think that they're going to do (82:12 - 82:16)
something holiday of 2022 no no they're (82:13 - 82:17)
going to do something but i don't think (82:16 - 82:20)
it's gen 9. yeah they're going to (82:17 - 82:22)
make a white remakes (82:20 - 82:23)
i mean (82:22 - 82:26)
i don't i don't think they're going to (82:23 - 82:28)
do gen 9 next year (82:26 - 82:30)
i don't think that's happening because (82:28 - 82:31)
of (82:30 - 82:33)
the delay this year (82:31 - 82:36)
because everything has been pushed back (82:33 - 82:38)
okay so i don't see that in a coveted (82:36 - 82:40)
sense that developers are behind gen 9 (82:38 - 82:43)
is going to happen in (82:40 - 82:46)
2022 i think it's going to be 2023 which (82:43 - 82:48)
leads me to think we are going to get (82:46 - 82:50)
some sort of (82:48 - 82:53)
update for sword and shield because (82:50 - 82:55)
there will be new pokemon coming (82:53 - 82:58)
in arceus which we'll talk about (82:55 - 83:00)
i don't think it's going to be a full (82:58 - 83:02)
dlc i do think they might do uh hey (83:00 - 83:05)
we're adding some pokemon in (83:02 - 83:07)
from these games and it'll be a free (83:05 - 83:09)
update but i do think because there's (83:07 - 83:11)
going to be so long before the next (83:09 - 83:14)
generation and we will have been sitting (83:11 - 83:16)
in sword and shield for (83:14 - 83:19)
ranked battles for (83:16 - 83:21)
what almost four years at that point (83:19 - 83:24)
there is going to be some sort of update (83:21 - 83:26)
to sword and shield i don't know what (83:24 - 83:28)
that looks like i don't think it (83:26 - 83:31)
includes everything but i do think (83:28 - 83:33)
because they are introducing new pokemon (83:31 - 83:35)
in arceus which we'll get to (83:33 - 83:38)
that they are going to do some sort of (83:35 - 83:39)
update to bring those into sword and (83:38 - 83:42)
shield i can agree with you there (83:39 - 83:44)
that there will be that there could be (83:42 - 83:46)
an update whether it's free i think it's (83:44 - 83:48)
real dangerous for them to do a paid (83:46 - 83:52)
update at this point yeah um well (83:48 - 83:53)
but (83:52 - 83:56)
if they decide to fill in a gap for not (83:53 - 83:58)
having something for christmas and make (83:56 - 84:00)
it a dlc and something else (83:58 - 84:01)
that i could see (84:00 - 84:03)
maybe i just i just don't see a world (84:01 - 84:05)
where they're like okay we're missing (84:03 - 84:07)
230 some pokemon and we're going to fill (84:05 - 84:09)
it in because like how do you even (84:07 - 84:12)
market that think about this (84:09 - 84:13)
part (84:12 - 84:15)
because because shield's missing 230 (84:13 - 84:17)
pokemon okay yeah but they've done dlc (84:15 - 84:19)
where they add completely new pokemon (84:17 - 84:21)
that aren't filled in pokemon yeah but a (84:19 - 84:23)
lot of people are not a lot of people (84:21 - 84:27)
some people are assuming that because (84:23 - 84:27)
these two new games aren't doing ranked (84:27 - 84:31)
and because there's still this (84:29 - 84:32)
speculation that sword and shield is (84:31 - 84:34)
missing the rest of the pokemon so (84:32 - 84:35)
therefore it should get the rest of the (84:34 - 84:37)
pokemon i am just arguing i'm just (84:35 - 84:39)
arguing that there's no there's no dlc i (84:37 - 84:41)
don't think that that includes 230 (84:39 - 84:43)
pokemon oh no no no no i could (84:41 - 84:45)
definitely see what greg said where they (84:43 - 84:47)
release a small update that's like (84:45 - 84:49)
here's stantler and it's evolution (84:47 - 84:52)
here's uh vasco legion here's a couple (84:49 - 84:55)
pokemon to coincide with (84:52 - 84:57)
arceus (84:55 - 84:59)
but even if they didn't add any new (84:57 - 85:01)
pokemon (84:59 - 85:04)
they already have ranked figured out (85:01 - 85:04)
because (85:04 - 85:06)
a ranked season lasts three months so (85:04 - 85:08)
we're right now in season 10. that's (85:06 - 85:11)
going to go till november season 11 is (85:08 - 85:13)
going to flip they still have not done (85:11 - 85:14)
the gs cup (85:13 - 85:17)
um that's going to be three more months (85:14 - 85:19)
so season 11 takes us to what february (85:17 - 85:21)
then they do a different version of the (85:19 - 85:23)
gs cup that takes us to (85:21 - 85:26)
march april may and then they do of (85:23 - 85:29)
season 13 takes us into worlds they only (85:26 - 85:32)
have to do three different rule sets gs (85:29 - 85:33)
cup being two of those rule sets you do (85:32 - 85:36)
a g x cup g s cup a g s cup for those (85:33 - 85:38)
not competitive or when you're allowed (85:36 - 85:41)
to use two box legends right now we've (85:38 - 85:44)
only been able to use one box legend so (85:41 - 85:47)
gs cup is two box legends easy you do gs (85:44 - 85:50)
cup with dynomax you do gs cup not (85:47 - 85:52)
dynamax that's six months of content (85:50 - 85:54)
that they don't have to worry about the (85:52 - 85:55)
pokedex that (85:54 - 85:57)
while maybe if you're not a competitive (85:55 - 85:58)
fan (85:57 - 86:01)
no one cares competitive people want the (85:58 - 86:03)
gs cup that is like the thing that they (86:01 - 86:05)
have been dying for like season 10 just (86:03 - 86:06)
doesn't scratch that itch they just want (86:05 - 86:09)
the gs cup so gs cup no dynomax gx cup (86:06 - 86:10)
with dynamics that's six months of (86:09 - 86:13)
competitive content so even if your (86:10 - 86:14)
argument is like well i gotta add the (86:13 - 86:16)
rest of the pokemon cause competitive is (86:14 - 86:17)
boring like (86:16 - 86:18)
you clearly aren't a competitive person (86:17 - 86:20)
like like (86:18 - 86:23)
adding wormpole and gorvus isn't going (86:20 - 86:25)
to change the sta the state of (86:23 - 86:28)
competitive having two boxed legendaries (86:25 - 86:29)
in your team is going to change the (86:28 - 86:31)
state of competitive um (86:29 - 86:33)
and for a third version they could just (86:31 - 86:35)
do another band right like they could (86:33 - 86:36)
just say like hey we're banning (86:35 - 86:37)
incineroar we're banning landorus we're (86:36 - 86:39)
banning like these and now here's your (86:37 - 86:41)
season 11. um like i think in a (86:39 - 86:43)
competitive sense (86:41 - 86:45)
filling out the rest of the pokedex just (86:43 - 86:46)
doesn't (86:45 - 86:49)
actually make sense in a marketing sense (86:46 - 86:50)
i think filling out the rest of the (86:49 - 86:52)
pokedex also doesn't make sense how do (86:50 - 86:55)
you go from like hey this dlc has 40 (86:52 - 86:57)
different legendary pokemon and a brand (86:55 - 87:00)
new like area to go like hey this dlc (86:57 - 87:03)
has wormpole and gormbus and clan pearl (87:00 - 87:05)
sounds riveting right like it just feels (87:03 - 87:07)
like very hard to market although i'm (87:05 - 87:08)
into it (87:07 - 87:10)
although i mean i guess they just (87:08 - 87:12)
i think i don't think it's that hard to (87:10 - 87:14)
market i think you're like because you (87:12 - 87:16)
can't figure out how you would market it (87:14 - 87:18)
doesn't mean that that's a reality i (87:16 - 87:20)
think they can definitely market however (87:18 - 87:22)
they want and would be very successful (87:20 - 87:24)
in it because it's their job i'm not (87:22 - 87:25)
worried about (87:24 - 87:28)
i i they can mark they have marketed (87:25 - 87:30)
all sorts of things that i'm like why (87:28 - 87:32)
are you doing this but people still buy (87:30 - 87:33)
it (87:32 - 87:35)
but i think i mean they couldn't market (87:33 - 87:38)
their way out of pokemon rumble (87:35 - 87:39)
well (87:38 - 87:40)
i mean you can only do so much with a (87:39 - 87:42)
bad game (87:40 - 87:45)
i i do think that (87:42 - 87:45)
they will need if if (87:46 - 87:50)
gen 9 isn't happening next year and i (87:48 - 87:53)
really doubt that it is they do need (87:50 - 87:57)
something to keep people engaged with (87:53 - 88:00)
pokemon and sword and shield since it we (87:57 - 88:02)
will still be playing that game at that (88:00 - 88:03)
point (88:02 - 88:06)
and there needs to be something (88:03 - 88:07)
there (88:06 - 88:10)
there's no way that the pokemon company (88:07 - 88:13)
doesn't put out a big product (88:10 - 88:15)
before christmas (88:13 - 88:17)
right but i don't i don't know that (88:15 - 88:19)
that's going to be gen 9. (88:17 - 88:22)
i think in this in a in a non-coveted (88:19 - 88:23)
world (88:22 - 88:24)
i think that is a gen 9 but i think (88:23 - 88:26)
you're right right (88:24 - 88:28)
we're not in that world because like if (88:26 - 88:30)
you if you if you're following other (88:28 - 88:31)
gaming news (88:30 - 88:33)
and you're you're you're looking at (88:31 - 88:37)
other developers out there (88:33 - 88:38)
every (88:37 - 88:39)
like (88:38 - 88:41)
theoretically we've gotten almost (88:39 - 88:43)
everything on time there have been some (88:41 - 88:44)
game delays (88:43 - 88:45)
like (88:44 - 88:48)
the big game delay was halo (88:45 - 88:50)
for the xbox (88:48 - 88:52)
but (88:50 - 88:52)
other gaming sources have reported that (88:54 - 88:59)
once these games come out they are so (88:57 - 89:02)
behind for the next game because of how (88:59 - 89:04)
covid has affected the work at home and (89:02 - 89:06)
because of how they had to change (89:04 - 89:07)
everything and (89:06 - 89:10)
and in in a in a sense like it is really (89:07 - 89:11)
hard (89:10 - 89:13)
for creative people (89:11 - 89:14)
to (89:13 - 89:17)
have creative (89:14 - 89:19)
ideals and have creative talks when (89:17 - 89:21)
everything is through zoom (89:19 - 89:24)
like creativity normally happens like oh (89:21 - 89:25)
i bumped into somebody in a hallway and (89:24 - 89:27)
we brought up this idea and now we're (89:25 - 89:29)
gonna make it reality or like oh (89:27 - 89:32)
remember at lunch where uh bob dropped (89:29 - 89:34)
his milk carton and we thought like it (89:32 - 89:36)
is really hard to be creative and to (89:34 - 89:37)
have (89:36 - 89:39)
thoughtful and fun conversations when (89:37 - 89:41)
you're just i would argue differently i (89:39 - 89:43)
don't think that's the issue i think (89:41 - 89:45)
game developers are using this all as an (89:43 - 89:48)
excuse to slow down the pace that (89:45 - 89:50)
they've been forced into by the wild (89:48 - 89:52)
frenzy of having to stay relevant in the (89:50 - 89:55)
market but also if we know that the 30th (89:52 - 89:59)
anniversary is 2026 (89:55 - 90:00)
and we assume (89:59 - 90:03)
that they will release they care about (90:00 - 90:04)
the 30th anniversary because they don't (90:03 - 90:07)
care about the 25th if they do the 10 (90:04 - 90:09)
gen 10 (90:07 - 90:12)
2026 for the 30th anniversary that means (90:09 - 90:16)
three years before that is 2023 (90:12 - 90:17)
which (90:16 - 90:18)
may also make sense from a timeline to (90:17 - 90:21)
release your gen 9. (90:18 - 90:22)
and it's it's (90:21 - 90:25)
three years after (90:22 - 90:26)
gen (90:25 - 90:28)
8 came out so (90:26 - 90:31)
eve it's like even timing wise 2022 (90:28 - 90:34)
feels a bit weird even if we weren't (90:31 - 90:36)
at (90:34 - 90:39)
this sort of covent stuff and i think (90:36 - 90:42)
covet has made that more of a lock to (90:39 - 90:46)
push back gen 9 to 2023 and in that case (90:42 - 90:48)
there does need to be some giant release (90:46 - 90:50)
next year around christmas (90:48 - 90:52)
i don't think it's gen 9 i think it's (90:50 - 90:55)
something else but (90:52 - 90:56)
because people will probably not (90:55 - 90:59)
consider it a main series game because (90:56 - 91:02)
people are weird there will be some form (90:59 - 91:03)
of minor update to sword and shield to (91:02 - 91:05)
keep people happy (91:03 - 91:07)
i (91:05 - 91:09)
one wouldn't be surprised if there was a (91:07 - 91:10)
re-release of sword and shield (91:09 - 91:13)
that included all the release like a (91:10 - 91:16)
third version a third version they could (91:13 - 91:18)
um (91:16 - 91:20)
with all the dlc and some extra stuff i (91:18 - 91:21)
wouldn't be surprised if that was a (91:20 - 91:23)
thing the pokemon company is very good (91:21 - 91:24)
at double dipping on whatever they (91:23 - 91:28)
already have yep literally (91:24 - 91:28)
i know i know we can point fingers at (91:28 - 91:31)
niantic and be like hey look it they (91:30 - 91:33)
released zashi and why even bother doing (91:31 - 91:34)
it they're going to release it again as (91:33 - 91:37)
it's shiny we're going to get pokemon z (91:34 - 91:40)
that's what's going to happen yeah (91:37 - 91:40)
smacked but i but they're they're (91:43 - 91:49)
there there's still a reason why these (91:47 - 91:52)
two games are so close together (91:49 - 91:54)
diamond and pearl and arceus and they (91:52 - 91:56)
haven't showed that off yet but there (91:54 - 91:57)
has to be a reason they're only three (91:56 - 92:00)
months apart if they were if they didn't (91:57 - 92:02)
have a plan for october november of next (92:00 - 92:04)
year they could have easily just held (92:02 - 92:06)
arceus till then (92:04 - 92:06)
i (92:06 - 92:08)
suspect that arceus is not going to be (92:06 - 92:10)
this grand huge game that everyone (92:08 - 92:11)
thinks it is i don't think it's going to (92:10 - 92:13)
have this huge pokedex i don't think (92:11 - 92:15)
it's going to have things that normally (92:13 - 92:17)
pokemon games have like breeding like (92:15 - 92:18)
that like no one has even brought this (92:17 - 92:19)
up like (92:18 - 92:20)
there's probably not breeding in this (92:19 - 92:22)
game there's probably no eggs there's (92:20 - 92:24)
probably there's no daycare because (92:22 - 92:26)
people and pokemon are separate yeah (92:24 - 92:28)
like i don't (92:26 - 92:30)
i like like there there is no you (92:28 - 92:33)
there's no pvp in right in arceus like (92:30 - 92:35)
they came out and said that they they (92:33 - 92:37)
did come out and say hey you'll be able (92:35 - 92:39)
to trade with other people but it is a (92:37 - 92:41)
single player experience i just don't (92:39 - 92:43)
think like i think arceus will be fine i (92:41 - 92:46)
think it will be fun like it looks great (92:43 - 92:47)
i just don't think it will be this huge (92:46 - 92:49)
game that (92:47 - 92:51)
i'm worried that people suspect it is (92:49 - 92:53)
because we cannot get away from the (92:51 - 92:55)
conversation that is this is pokemon (92:53 - 92:56)
broke breath of the wild (92:55 - 92:59)
and that's a high (92:56 - 93:00)
those are high expectations anytime a (92:59 - 93:02)
game is compared to breath of the wild (93:00 - 93:04)
no one beats breath of the wild (93:02 - 93:06)
breath of the wild is just like this (93:04 - 93:08)
this game that will be remembered for (93:06 - 93:10)
all time like ocarina of time or like (93:08 - 93:13)
super mario 64 that is like this epic (93:10 - 93:15)
amazing game and of course companies (93:13 - 93:16)
want to copy that of course companies (93:15 - 93:18)
look at that game to be like can we be (93:16 - 93:20)
that game and i just don't think legends (93:18 - 93:22)
is going to be breath of the wild i just (93:20 - 93:24)
don't think it will be this huge i think (93:22 - 93:25)
it will be fun and that's okay i don't (93:24 - 93:27)
think every game needs to be as big or (93:25 - 93:28)
as grand as breath of the wild although (93:27 - 93:32)
it'd be nice if they could match it um (93:28 - 93:34)
but (93:32 - 93:35)
it's not like they're going to start gen (93:34 - 93:38)
9 after arceus i'm sure they've started (93:35 - 93:40)
gen 9 as soon as they've finished sword (93:38 - 93:42)
and shield yeah uh (93:40 - 93:43)
and i'm sure it's been and sword and (93:42 - 93:47)
shield is going to be two years old in (93:43 - 93:50)
two months three months (93:47 - 93:50)
next year is three years since sword and (93:54 - 93:58)
shield so theoretically (93:55 - 94:01)
they would have gen nine done (93:58 - 94:01)
it's just it's just very weird that (94:02 - 94:06)
arceus is in january (94:04 - 94:08)
yes (94:06 - 94:10)
and diamond and pearl is in november (94:08 - 94:12)
yeah i just it's not weird in the sense (94:10 - 94:14)
that they're both cinno like that makes (94:12 - 94:17)
sense well then apples (94:14 - 94:20)
i have issues um (94:17 - 94:24)
but there has to be something big (94:20 - 94:26)
to fill out their holiday yep (94:24 - 94:28)
and if it's not gen 9 then obviously the (94:26 - 94:31)
gen 9 would be the following year (94:28 - 94:31)
i don't yeah (94:31 - 94:33)
what i don't know what it is (94:31 - 94:36)
makes more sense 20-23 really (94:33 - 94:38)
because it's gonna put three years i (94:36 - 94:40)
don't disagree i agree that puts three (94:38 - 94:43)
years between each gen and i guarantee (94:40 - 94:45)
they're aiming gen 10 for the 30th (94:43 - 94:48)
anniversary (94:45 - 94:48)
it's a sword and shield third edition (94:51 - 94:54)
that (94:53 - 94:56)
includes (94:54 - 94:57)
kalos (94:56 - 94:58)
and (94:57 - 95:00)
i did think that i did think if they did (94:58 - 95:03)
a dlc they could put in chaos because it (95:00 - 95:04)
would put another region they're going (95:03 - 95:07)
to charge you for that air 60 bucks make (95:04 - 95:09)
it yeah (95:07 - 95:13)
pay for expansion why not go to kalos (95:09 - 95:14)
they'll all be under leveled because we (95:13 - 95:16)
didn't change that game in any way your (95:14 - 95:19)
helmet takes your level 100 to caleb's (95:16 - 95:21)
it will still crash (95:19 - 95:22)
okay but okay even if we go back to the (95:21 - 95:25)
competitive conversation they have three (95:22 - 95:28)
seasons to bring us to august (95:25 - 95:31)
we going to go another year into sword (95:28 - 95:33)
and shield competitive (95:31 - 95:35)
until we get to gen 9 or are they gonna (95:33 - 95:36)
put out (95:35 - 95:38)
something (95:36 - 95:40)
maybe it's a new pokemon battle (95:38 - 95:41)
revolution (95:40 - 95:43)
like they're just being like hi this is (95:41 - 95:45)
where we're moving competitive to this (95:43 - 95:46)
only competitive (95:45 - 95:48)
gym game (95:46 - 95:51)
it's pokemon battle revolution two (95:48 - 95:53)
now with mirror b (95:51 - 95:56)
all pokemon competitive is just unite (95:53 - 95:59)
[Laughter] (95:56 - 96:00)
i mean they they can definitely get away (95:59 - 96:02)
with skipping a year i mean they skipped (96:00 - 96:04)
last year i mean they put out dlc but (96:02 - 96:06)
like there wasn't a brand new game on (96:04 - 96:09)
the shelf they skipped 2015 i think (96:06 - 96:12)
which was the year right before (96:09 - 96:14)
um (96:12 - 96:16)
which was the year right before sun and (96:14 - 96:17)
moon (96:16 - 96:19)
uh which everyone thought pokemon z was (96:17 - 96:22)
going to come out that year nothing did (96:19 - 96:26)
i don't know if you get away with really (96:22 - 96:28)
with releasing a game in january and (96:26 - 96:30)
then putting nothing else out for 11 (96:28 - 96:32)
months (96:30 - 96:33)
that that being said there's also the (96:32 - 96:35)
conversation that gen 9 doesn't have to (96:33 - 96:37)
come out in october november it could (96:35 - 96:38)
come out in march it could come out in (96:37 - 96:40)
april very very much so yes black and (96:38 - 96:42)
black and white came out in in the (96:40 - 96:43)
united states that came out i believe in (96:42 - 96:45)
march the thing that i think of is that (96:43 - 96:46)
we will get (96:45 - 96:48)
something around christmas and then gen (96:46 - 96:51)
9 will happen in the early part of (96:48 - 96:53)
2023. (96:51 - 96:55)
like i can see it being an earlier (96:53 - 96:56)
release (96:55 - 96:57)
than (96:56 - 96:59)
than sword and shield was like turn jam (96:57 - 97:02)
was november and i could see them doing (96:59 - 97:06)
uh gen 9 in the first half of 2023 what (97:02 - 97:08)
i don't see is i don't see uh i don't (97:06 - 97:10)
see like a let's go johto or whatever (97:08 - 97:12)
other people are speculating that's just (97:10 - 97:14)
you're you're building a whole new game (97:12 - 97:16)
from the ground up again like they need (97:14 - 97:18)
time to finish gen 9 i mean if they're (97:16 - 97:20)
if they're just adding on and editing (97:18 - 97:23)
and fixing like a sword and shield (97:20 - 97:25)
re-release which is possible which i (97:23 - 97:27)
think is maybe a little more more likely (97:25 - 97:29)
than other scenarios like we saw with (97:27 - 97:31)
ultrasound ultra moon they did it in (97:29 - 97:34)
less than a year the engine for let's go (97:31 - 97:38)
is already built though right true so (97:34 - 97:41)
i don't think creating all of (97:38 - 97:42)
johto (97:41 - 97:43)
would be the (97:42 - 97:46)
problem (97:43 - 97:46)
i don't think it's that hard when i say (97:47 - 97:52)
i mean i think if if if just copy and (97:49 - 97:53)
paste they're good at it yeah they're (97:52 - 97:55)
cut and copy paste and then shrink it 65 (97:53 - 97:57)
for chibi (97:55 - 97:58)
uh (97:57 - 97:59)
i think (97:58 - 98:01)
it's just a reduction it's image reduced (97:59 - 98:03)
i i do think it is possible that we (98:01 - 98:05)
would get another game (98:03 - 98:07)
similar to let's go that when they (98:05 - 98:09)
realize at the beginning of the pandemic (98:07 - 98:11)
like we need to (98:09 - 98:12)
we need to work on something because (98:11 - 98:13)
these time frames aren't going to work (98:12 - 98:15)
out and they've had (98:13 - 98:17)
they will have had (98:15 - 98:19)
almost two and a half years to work on (98:17 - 98:21)
that product (98:19 - 98:22)
and they wouldn't have built it from the (98:21 - 98:24)
ground up so i think it is (98:22 - 98:28)
possible because you on an existing (98:24 - 98:31)
game you don't need that creativity (98:28 - 98:33)
meeting part because those things are (98:31 - 98:35)
already made they can be built (98:33 - 98:37)
in silos away from other people because (98:35 - 98:39)
you're just recreating something and you (98:37 - 98:41)
have the art direction done i i think (98:39 - 98:44)
it's i don't think it's as far-fetched (98:41 - 98:46)
as (98:44 - 98:46)
a lot of things (98:46 - 98:50)
because i do think recreating a game or (98:47 - 98:52)
building off an existing engine can be (98:50 - 98:53)
done (98:52 - 98:56)
individually and not as much in teams (98:53 - 98:57)
like where you have to be at a core (98:56 - 98:59)
meeting and talk about art direction and (98:57 - 99:01)
talk about pokemon fitting together (98:59 - 99:03)
because the game is already established (99:01 - 99:05)
the script is already written you just (99:03 - 99:08)
need to make the assets (99:05 - 99:08)
yeah i just think there was a little bit (99:09 - 99:13)
more passion behind let's go like they (99:10 - 99:15)
did read they did write a new story they (99:13 - 99:17)
did (99:15 - 99:19)
fix issues (99:17 - 99:22)
write a news story (99:19 - 99:24)
like it was cute like the whole marowak (99:22 - 99:25)
thing and everything was very good i (99:24 - 99:27)
mean (99:25 - 99:28)
they they (99:27 - 99:31)
they changed a couple of things which is (99:28 - 99:32)
not that hard to do (99:31 - 99:35)
like the basic story of jesus here's the (99:32 - 99:37)
other thing i wanna i wanna point out is (99:35 - 99:39)
it like (99:37 - 99:41)
the art direction for both diamond and (99:39 - 99:42)
pearl which makes sense because diamond (99:41 - 99:44)
pearl is made by ilka and the art (99:42 - 99:47)
direction for (99:44 - 99:47)
arceus is not done by james turner his (99:48 - 99:52)
name hasn't been brought up right at all (99:50 - 99:53)
since sword and shield (99:52 - 99:57)
so i because he got fired for trees yeah (99:53 - 99:59)
because i hated the trees so much they (99:57 - 100:01)
sent them back to the uk (99:59 - 100:03)
go back to england and study your trees (100:01 - 100:05)
so i am sure that (100:03 - 100:06)
like there's no doubt that they're (100:05 - 100:09)
working on gen 9 yeah they probably (100:06 - 100:11)
started gen 9 the day that gen 8 shipped (100:09 - 100:12)
at the door (100:11 - 100:13)
because (100:12 - 100:15)
or before (100:13 - 100:17)
because uh james turner wasn't also (100:15 - 100:19)
involved at least that we know of or (100:17 - 100:20)
wasn't publicly talked about the dlc (100:19 - 100:22)
like the dlcs are also probably being (100:20 - 100:26)
worked on and whatever um (100:22 - 100:26)
i i i guess we'll we'll find out all of (100:28 - 100:33)
this come february of next year they'll (100:31 - 100:34)
release arceus (100:33 - 100:36)
february will come they'll be like we (100:34 - 100:38)
got some arceus dlc (100:36 - 100:40)
here's our plan for the year (100:38 - 100:43)
whatever and it will be fine pokemon day (100:40 - 100:46)
2022 will will bring us all sorts of (100:43 - 100:51)
interesting ideas sure 26th anniversary (100:46 - 100:52)
remember all the things we didn't do (100:51 - 100:54)
last year we broke the pattern we're (100:52 - 100:57)
doing sixes now (100:54 - 100:57)
i just i i just don't see 230 pokemon (100:59 - 101:05)
coming to sword and shield (101:02 - 101:08)
i just don't see that happening (101:05 - 101:08)
you've been wrong before (101:10 - 101:13)
i have been (101:12 - 101:14)
uh i've been wrong a lot of times on (101:13 - 101:16)
this podcast (101:14 - 101:20)
i was right with mamoswine so (101:16 - 101:21)
put it on your linkedin profile i'm sure (101:20 - 101:23)
it is (101:21 - 101:24)
believe me every time i'm right it goes (101:23 - 101:27)
on the leaderboards (101:24 - 101:27)
uh (101:28 - 101:30)
they showed the swamp mechanics and the (101:30 - 101:34)
snow mechanics again (101:32 - 101:37)
those are not fun (101:34 - 101:39)
the one thing i'm i'm super happy that (101:37 - 101:40)
they they they showed character (101:39 - 101:42)
customization i know we talked about it (101:40 - 101:43)
earlier i do think it's super important (101:42 - 101:45)
i think representation in games is (101:43 - 101:47)
incredibly important (101:45 - 101:48)
um (101:47 - 101:49)
i think the following pokemon is a nice (101:48 - 101:51)
touch i think the chibis look better (101:49 - 101:53)
than they looked back in february (101:51 - 101:55)
uh overall i was super impressed with (101:53 - 101:56)
the trailer (101:55 - 101:58)
um i'm very (101:56 - 102:00)
i've always kind of had the mindset of (101:58 - 102:02)
like sword shield is like my favorite (102:00 - 102:03)
pokemon game (102:02 - 102:04)
probably (102:03 - 102:06)
besides that it's probably ultrasound (102:04 - 102:08)
ultramoon it's really hard for remakes (102:06 - 102:09)
to (102:08 - 102:11)
like surpass and be my favorite pokemon (102:09 - 102:13)
games because they usually like go this (102:11 - 102:15)
weird route or they usually cut things (102:13 - 102:15)
or (102:15 - 102:16)
um (102:15 - 102:20)
in the case of diamond and pearl (102:16 - 102:21)
if there's no sword and shield pokemon (102:20 - 102:23)
that seems really weird to me but i also (102:21 - 102:26)
understand but also like (102:23 - 102:26)
like i don't but like the lack of no (102:26 - 102:31)
competitive or ranked ladder is like (102:30 - 102:33)
kind of a bummer but i also get that too (102:31 - 102:34)
because it's not a game freak game it's (102:33 - 102:36)
an elka game (102:34 - 102:37)
um (102:36 - 102:39)
overall though it looks like at the end (102:37 - 102:41)
of the day they look great they look (102:39 - 102:43)
really fun it looks way more i think (102:41 - 102:45)
they have a fantastic look absolutely (102:43 - 102:47)
they do yes i mean apart from the fact (102:45 - 102:49)
that (102:47 - 102:51)
rourke is looking like he's (102:49 - 102:55)
whatever mess it is a world i want to (102:51 - 102:58)
play in 100 it's just it grabbed me the (102:55 - 102:59)
same way the let's go world did it's (102:58 - 103:01)
just like this is a world i want to play (102:59 - 103:04)
in (103:01 - 103:04)
it looks cute i'm excited for it (103:05 - 103:09)
uh they had some new music i don't know (103:07 - 103:10)
if the new music is gonna be the game (103:09 - 103:12)
but i liked it (103:10 - 103:13)
the only thing (103:12 - 103:15)
that they didn't show or talk about but (103:13 - 103:17)
we know it's there (103:15 - 103:21)
i saw i saw the path for rock climb (103:17 - 103:24)
we don't know if hm's are here or not (103:21 - 103:26)
hms are going to be in the game (103:24 - 103:28)
100 (103:26 - 103:30)
they would have shown some sort of (103:28 - 103:32)
writing on pokemon if they were not (103:30 - 103:34)
going to be in the hm's will be in the (103:32 - 103:35)
game (103:34 - 103:40)
i put my coin on that square i don't (103:35 - 103:42)
want to agree but i since they have not (103:40 - 103:44)
said that they're gone (103:42 - 103:47)
i i have to agree with authenticity (103:44 - 103:50)
authenticity i do think i don't know if (103:47 - 103:52)
they changed the language at one point (103:50 - 103:54)
but if you went back and like obviously (103:52 - 103:56)
the website's all up to date now with (103:54 - 103:58)
with the new information but (103:56 - 103:59)
like right before the (103:58 - 104:01)
press release i reread the original (103:59 - 104:03)
website and they said the story was (104:01 - 104:05)
faithfully restored and i felt like it (104:03 - 104:08)
never said that when they initially (104:05 - 104:10)
were launched so they like changed some (104:08 - 104:13)
words of the story is faithful i think (104:10 - 104:16)
they when people were like (104:13 - 104:16)
arguing that this is a one-for-one (104:16 - 104:21)
complete recreation with nothing changed (104:18 - 104:23)
because of the one word faithfully that (104:21 - 104:25)
they decided to clarify and say the (104:23 - 104:28)
story is a faithful one because we're (104:25 - 104:29)
clearly changing things and here's the (104:28 - 104:32)
here is the trailer to prove it here are (104:29 - 104:34)
the things we're changing (104:32 - 104:35)
and one of the things they did not (104:34 - 104:39)
mention was hms (104:35 - 104:40)
yeah (104:39 - 104:43)
but there's lots of things that are (104:40 - 104:46)
like the park the gts tower there's lots (104:43 - 104:48)
of things that have to be changed so (104:46 - 104:50)
yeah the i mean the gts tower what did (104:48 - 104:52)
it exist anywhere with union rooms and (104:50 - 104:54)
since they run everything through home (104:52 - 104:56)
what goes there why would you want to (104:54 - 104:59)
manage two different trading posts so i (104:56 - 105:01)
don't know what goes in that spot they (104:59 - 105:03)
just didn't mention that either (105:01 - 105:05)
i thought the way that let's go handled (105:03 - 105:07)
hm's was perfect (105:05 - 105:09)
do we (105:07 - 105:12)
still have to find three clowns (105:09 - 105:14)
in that stupid city yes if you watch the (105:12 - 105:18)
trailer there is one of the clowns there (105:14 - 105:18)
for i know that some people are not sold (105:19 - 105:24)
on the chibi i definitely get it i do (105:21 - 105:25)
think the chibis look much much better (105:24 - 105:27)
than they did earlier but (105:25 - 105:28)
i didn't hate them before and they were (105:27 - 105:30)
chibis in the original game yeah that's (105:28 - 105:31)
where (105:30 - 105:33)
it takes me back to like to the original (105:31 - 105:35)
pokemon world that drew me in in the (105:33 - 105:37)
first place (105:35 - 105:39)
uh we're we're gonna take a break and (105:37 - 105:42)
talk about arceus but i do think it's (105:39 - 105:44)
comparing arceus art style to sword and (105:42 - 105:46)
shield art style to diamond and pearl (105:44 - 105:49)
art style to let's go art style one (105:46 - 105:52)
boy four different styles but yeah (105:49 - 105:54)
looking back on let's go (105:52 - 105:56)
man that art style was so good i think (105:54 - 105:57)
let's go (105:56 - 105:59)
probably the one i gravitate towards the (105:57 - 106:01)
most (105:59 - 106:03)
uh uh i don't know (106:01 - 106:05)
it was cute it's not my favorite it's (106:03 - 106:07)
it's very (106:05 - 106:09)
i'll say this about let's go it is very (106:07 - 106:11)
very bright and optimistic (106:09 - 106:14)
right it's got a very bright pe (106:11 - 106:15)
pull up a screenshot of let's go to (106:14 - 106:18)
diamond pearl it's like (106:15 - 106:19)
diamond pearl lost about 300 different (106:18 - 106:23)
colors like what happened here (106:19 - 106:23)
all right let's take a break when we (106:24 - 106:26)
come back we'll talk about arceus (106:25 - 106:29)
legends or legends arceus and we'll see (106:26 - 106:32)
you after the breaks (106:29 - 106:32)
[Music] (106:33 - 106:54)
a (106:53 - 107:02)
[Music] (106:54 - 107:03)
that (107:02 - 107:07)
[Music] (107:03 - 107:06)
that is (107:07 - 107:07)
[Music] (107:27 - 107:34)
band (107:32 - 107:37)
[Music] (107:34 - 107:37)
and we are back (107:39 - 107:43)
i forgot we forgot this one thing before (107:41 - 107:45)
we talk about arceus there's a manafee (107:43 - 107:48)
egg (107:45 - 107:48)
nude receive a manafee egg as a special (107:48 - 107:52)
early bonus for brilliant diamond and (107:51 - 107:54)
shining pearl (107:52 - 107:56)
you can receive your egg by the internet (107:54 - 108:00)
via the mystery gift until february 21st (107:56 - 108:02)
you put your party carried around it (108:00 - 108:05)
will hatch into a manafee a internet (108:02 - 108:08)
connection is required but online (108:05 - 108:10)
nintendo paid subscription is not (108:08 - 108:12)
required (108:10 - 108:14)
this is the sword and shield i didn't (108:12 - 108:15)
see this in the pokemon presents and i (108:14 - 108:17)
watched it multiple times this is in (108:15 - 108:19)
diamond or pearl oh that game's not out (108:17 - 108:21)
yet (108:19 - 108:21)
and no it wasn't in the presentation but (108:21 - 108:26)
it is on the official website (108:24 - 108:28)
then if you check the manafee and the (108:26 - 108:30)
ditto into the nursery (108:28 - 108:34)
uh you can get a fione (108:30 - 108:35)
and just (108:34 - 108:37)
because i guess people didn't know this (108:35 - 108:39)
but fiona also makes fiona (108:37 - 108:40)
yeah (108:39 - 108:44)
and peony does not evolve into manafee (108:40 - 108:46)
correct because it needs the special (108:44 - 108:49)
waters of the region that it comes from (108:46 - 108:51)
and obviously you're not there until (108:49 - 108:54)
they come out with their big uh fall (108:51 - 108:58)
2022 release pokemon ranger (108:54 - 109:00)
remix wait is that (108:58 - 109:02)
we spinning you need special water (109:00 - 109:05)
that's that's the reason why the fiones (109:02 - 109:07)
don't evolve yeah yeah because they're (109:05 - 109:09)
not in the waters of oh god (109:07 - 109:11)
it's not it's not all mia the first game (109:09 - 109:14)
is not all me oh (109:11 - 109:14)
the second game is definitely shadows of (109:20 - 109:25)
all mia (109:22 - 109:25)
right (109:25 - 109:28)
oblivia (109:28 - 109:32)
oblivia (109:30 - 109:34)
got it (109:32 - 109:36)
uh pokemon legends arceus uh will take (109:34 - 109:38)
trainers on an adventure through the (109:36 - 109:40)
cinahl region of the past before it was (109:38 - 109:43)
even called sinnoh yeah it's not the (109:40 - 109:45)
cinna region i got issues already what (109:43 - 109:47)
do you mean it's not the cinder region (109:45 - 109:48)

male (109:48 - 109:52)
well who is that country called (109:49 - 109:53)
malmar (109:52 - 109:56)
burma (109:53 - 109:56)

incorrect this is so geopolitical and (110:01 - 110:07)
offensive i am that's right no different (110:04 - 110:09)
political parties call that country (110:07 - 110:13)
different things istanbul (110:09 - 110:16)
was can santa nopel correct (110:13 - 110:19)
istanbul's not contact (110:16 - 110:19)
myanmar was burma right because of a (110:20 - 110:26)
political decision that was like if our (110:23 - 110:28)
current president said i didn't like the (110:26 - 110:30)
name of the country our former president (110:28 - 110:31)
called it so i'm calling it something (110:30 - 110:32)
else (110:31 - 110:35)
that's what that is how do we know that (110:32 - 110:38)
in sin oh it wasn't (110:35 - 110:41)
we don't this is my first issue (110:38 - 110:44)
the he's sweet it's always political uh (110:41 - 110:45)
yeah (110:44 - 110:47)
uh many years ago the land was called (110:45 - 110:50)
the hugh sweet is that my am i saying (110:47 - 110:50)
that (110:50 - 110:53)
he's sweet (110:50 - 110:54)
uh (110:53 - 110:56)
region and it was rare for humans and (110:54 - 110:59)
pokemon to live in close harmony (110:56 - 111:02)
as a member of the galaxy expedition (110:59 - 111:05)
team players will visit jubalife village (111:02 - 111:07)
a bustling settlement that serves as the (111:05 - 111:10)
base of operations after receiving an (111:07 - 111:11)
assignment or request trainers will set (111:10 - 111:13)
out of the village to study one of the (111:11 - 111:16)
various areas of the hugh sui region (111:13 - 111:17)
uh after (111:16 - 111:18)
don't worry by the time this game comes (111:17 - 111:20)
out i will (111:18 - 111:22)
say that perfectly after they finish (111:20 - 111:24)
their survey work trainers we'll return (111:22 - 111:26)
to juba life to prepare for their next (111:24 - 111:29)
next task whenever trainers leave juba (111:26 - 111:30)
life city to (111:29 - 111:34)
to set out on an ex excu excu (111:30 - 111:37)
excursion excursion (111:34 - 111:38)
it was at the tip of my tongue their (111:37 - 111:40)
first stop will be one of the base camps (111:38 - 111:42)
that serve as an outpost for their work (111:40 - 111:44)
these base camps are more than just (111:42 - 111:46)
starting points trainers can stop and (111:44 - 111:47)
rest (111:46 - 111:50)
uh letting their team recover health or (111:47 - 111:52)
using a base camp work bench to craft (111:50 - 111:56)
items i do not care for this monster (111:52 - 111:57)
hunter garbage (111:56 - 112:00)
that was the body the opposite i was (111:57 - 112:01)
like oh i'm getting such a strong (112:00 - 112:04)
monster hunter vibe off visitors do not (112:01 - 112:07)
care for this monster hunter garbage in (112:04 - 112:10)
my pokemon game just wait until you try (112:07 - 112:12)
it greg you'll like it you'll like it as (112:10 - 112:14)
i i had too much crafting and animal (112:12 - 112:17)
crossing to (112:14 - 112:20)
as trainers progress towards completing (112:17 - 112:24)
look crafting is just like very now (112:20 - 112:27)
everybody likes to craft i know i know (112:24 - 112:30)
entire show about making it (112:27 - 112:32)
um i well like two three of the biggest (112:30 - 112:33)
games in the world fortnite roblox and (112:32 - 112:35)
minecraft all have crafting like it's (112:33 - 112:38)
not surprising uh as trainers progress (112:35 - 112:41)
towards completing the pokedex and (112:38 - 112:43)
increase in rank as a member of the (112:41 - 112:46)
galaxy team i have an issue (112:43 - 112:47)
they will meet interesting characters (112:46 - 112:49)
and encounter unique pokemon living in (112:47 - 112:51)
the houston region (112:49 - 112:53)
so first we have weird deer (112:51 - 112:56)
the big horned pokemon normal psychic (112:53 - 112:59)
stantler will evolve into weirder (112:56 - 113:01)
notice they use the word stantler so i (112:59 - 113:03)
don't think we're getting a (113:01 - 113:05)
unique stantler using the black orbs at (113:03 - 113:07)
its base of its antlers this pokemon (113:05 - 113:09)
will generate and unleash psychic energy (113:07 - 113:13)
powerful enough to dis distort space (113:09 - 113:16)
then we have basket legion the big fish (113:13 - 113:18)
pokemon it is water ghost (113:16 - 113:20)
basket legion in the history region will (113:18 - 113:21)
evolve (113:20 - 113:23)
baskelin in the history region will (113:21 - 113:24)
evolve into vasculation when they are (113:23 - 113:26)
possessed by the souls of other (113:24 - 113:28)
masculine from their school that could (113:26 - 113:31)
not withstand the harsh journey upstream (113:28 - 113:34)
so dark their power is bolstered by the (113:31 - 113:36)
souls possessing them letting them swim (113:34 - 113:39)
without tiring (113:36 - 113:41)
so two brand new pokemon (113:39 - 113:44)
we have the hissuian bravery (113:41 - 113:46)
which is a psychic flying when rufflet (113:44 - 113:48)
in the his region evolves (113:46 - 113:49)
so (113:48 - 113:52)
safe to say probably just normal rufflet (113:49 - 113:54)
they will become hisui and bravery (113:52 - 113:57)
bravery can imbued its eerie screeches (113:54 - 113:59)
with psychic power to generate the (113:57 - 114:01)
powerful shockwaves it can also use its (113:59 - 114:04)
psychic power to sharpen its sixth sense (114:01 - 114:06)
seeing dead people no wait that was a (114:04 - 114:08)
movie uh entering a trance that boasts (114:06 - 114:10)
its psychic abilities (114:08 - 114:13)
and then we have hissuian growlithe (114:10 - 114:16)
this growlithe appears in the his region (114:13 - 114:18)
his suing growleth has no has longer (114:16 - 114:21)
more voluminous fur previously (114:18 - 114:23)
discovered from the other form of (114:21 - 114:25)
growlithe highly vigilant they tend to (114:23 - 114:27)
be seen watching over their territories (114:25 - 114:30)
in pairs (114:27 - 114:32)
okay uh i think the new pokemon are a (114:30 - 114:34)
pretty big deal so let's put all (114:32 - 114:36)
gameplay and story things aside and (114:34 - 114:38)
let's focus on these four (114:36 - 114:40)
i have issues (114:38 - 114:42)
with the po well we know you have issues (114:40 - 114:43)
with the crafting we know you have (114:42 - 114:45)
issues with the weird storyline thing (114:43 - 114:47)
you got issues with these four pokemons (114:45 - 114:48)
yes (114:47 - 114:50)
okay let me hear them (114:48 - 114:51)
one (114:50 - 114:53)
i really wish some of them were more (114:51 - 114:55)
unique types that we didn't already have (114:53 - 114:58)
in the game like weird year not being (114:55 - 115:00)
normal ice and instead being normal (114:58 - 115:01)
psychic (115:00 - 115:02)
like (115:01 - 115:05)
budget giraffe rig like it's just it (115:02 - 115:06)
that already exists we have indeed we (115:05 - 115:08)
have drafted but you have to look at the (115:06 - 115:10)
balance of the pokemon that are in the (115:08 - 115:12)
game which we don't have the full range (115:10 - 115:15)
but still i think that that is a misstep (115:12 - 115:16)
same with basket legion water ghost we (115:15 - 115:18)
already have a water ghost whatever it's (115:16 - 115:19)
fine (115:18 - 115:20)
yeah but (115:19 - 115:22)
don't speak don't speak ill of (115:20 - 115:24)
vasculation this might be one of the (115:22 - 115:26)
greatest one of the greatest pokemon you (115:24 - 115:29)
cannot turn like this no no (115:26 - 115:32)
you're not allowed oh cool (115:29 - 115:35)
uh i same with (115:32 - 115:36)
same with all other types i was not (115:35 - 115:39)
wowed by the types i love their design (115:36 - 115:41)
my biggest issue is this is a game set (115:39 - 115:43)
in the past (115:41 - 115:45)
are you gonna bother to answer what (115:43 - 115:48)
happened to them yeah because they don't (115:45 - 115:50)
exist celebi and hoopa they had a (115:48 - 115:52)
weekend together that's all (115:50 - 115:54)
and they just said we're gonna zork (115:52 - 115:57)
these four pokemon into the future (115:54 - 116:00)
and suddenly what's gonna happen like (115:57 - 116:02)
the other thing is that we have the (116:00 - 116:04)
whole thing about this is putting (116:02 - 116:06)
together a pokedex and so (116:04 - 116:08)
we've never in the history of all the (116:06 - 116:10)
games that take place in the future have (116:08 - 116:12)
ever heard of these even though they (116:10 - 116:15)
were supposed to have been catalogued (116:12 - 116:16)
thousands of years ago it's going (116:15 - 116:20)
extinct it's an alternate universe as (116:16 - 116:24)
every daggon pokemon game has ever been (116:20 - 116:27)
it's in alternative (116:24 - 116:29)
questions it bothers me that they are (116:27 - 116:32)
introducing these in a game that is set (116:29 - 116:34)
in the past and they have not bothered (116:32 - 116:36)
to mention them they could not even (116:34 - 116:39)
answer why leon got lost all the time (116:36 - 116:41)
they couldn't even figure that out they (116:39 - 116:45)
were just like here's a characteristic (116:41 - 116:45)
it bother it i okay it's weird because (116:47 - 116:52)
i'm really excited i like all these (116:50 - 116:54)
designs i'm not thrilled about their (116:52 - 116:56)
typings but whatever i think all their (116:54 - 116:58)
designs are really amazing (116:56 - 117:00)
it just (116:58 - 117:03)
i'm like you chose the game set in the (117:00 - 117:04)
past (117:03 - 117:08)
set in a region that will become sinnoh (117:04 - 117:08)
and we've never ever (117:09 - 117:13)
ever heard of them before as a person (117:10 - 117:14)
that really sort of likes the lore and (117:13 - 117:17)
the timeline i am absolutely hoping (117:14 - 117:19)
there is somewhere that they answered (117:17 - 117:20)
the question (117:19 - 117:22)
what happened (117:20 - 117:25)
where did they go and why because (117:22 - 117:28)
otherwise their introduction will always (117:25 - 117:30)
bother me (117:28 - 117:30)
i don't know it doesn't bother me in the (117:33 - 117:36)
sense of like (117:34 - 117:37)
i mean it's so consistent with (117:36 - 117:39)
everything (117:37 - 117:41)
like oh we forgot this whole island of (117:39 - 117:43)
alola existed with all these other (117:41 - 117:44)
pokemon and we're just learning about it (117:43 - 117:46)
now (117:44 - 117:49)
i mean exploring new regions and not (117:46 - 117:51)
having cross-pollination is a thing that (117:49 - 117:53)
happens like (117:51 - 117:54)
unless they have a way to fly from an (117:53 - 117:57)
island or somebody deliberately brings (117:54 - 118:00)
another species in and then ruins the (117:57 - 118:03)
ecosystem by introducing a non-native (118:00 - 118:06)
species it is common to go to a region (118:03 - 118:08)
and say we've never explored beer here (118:06 - 118:11)
before and we learn new things (118:08 - 118:14)
we have explored this region before it's (118:11 - 118:16)
called diamond and pearl so here's a (118:14 - 118:19)
question been here for a long time did (118:16 - 118:21)
the let's go games have fairy type in (118:19 - 118:22)
them (118:21 - 118:25)
yeah yeah right but so how how did that (118:22 - 118:28)
magically happen (118:25 - 118:28)
they explained that each (118:28 - 118:31)
new (118:30 - 118:34)
console is its own universe they did (118:31 - 118:37)
that at the end of omega ruby alpha (118:34 - 118:39)
sapphire yeah yeah literally you were (118:37 - 118:41)
mad about anything it's a mega ruby off (118:39 - 118:42)
sapphire just throwing everything in the (118:41 - 118:44)
trash and being like (118:42 - 118:47)
everything is an alternate universe (118:44 - 118:50)
offered a reason why (118:47 - 118:53)
alternate universes exist for the (118:50 - 118:55)
consoles that (118:53 - 118:57)
they never said for the consoles they (118:55 - 118:59)
just said alternate universes i feel (118:57 - 119:02)
like in a world where you have one (118:59 - 119:05)
pokemon that can summon every legendary (119:02 - 119:06)
with hoops and you have one pokemon that (119:05 - 119:09)
can time travel and you have one pokemon (119:06 - 119:11)
that can control the flow of time and (119:09 - 119:14)
space but those are two pokemon like i (119:11 - 119:16)
feel like this is not that big in this (119:14 - 119:19)
region of all regions the time and space (119:16 - 119:22)
region all regions where they heavily (119:19 - 119:24)
talked about the lore and the history in (119:22 - 119:26)
the past throughout diamond and pearl (119:24 - 119:29)
they introduce not only does it have a (119:26 - 119:31)
new name that they've never talked about (119:29 - 119:33)
before but at least four new pokemon (119:31 - 119:35)
that we've never heard of before all i'm (119:33 - 119:38)
saying is there had better be (119:35 - 119:40)
at least a throw off line somewhere to (119:38 - 119:43)
explain what happens to these or it's (119:40 - 119:45)
going to bug me for (119:43 - 119:47)
ever i mean i would assume so i mean (119:45 - 119:48)
like the easy answer is like they went (119:47 - 119:51)
extinct or cyrus got his plan or (119:48 - 119:52)
their that this is an alternative (119:51 - 119:55)
timeline i'm sure there is i mean like i (119:52 - 119:56)
feel like they're making a big deal (119:55 - 119:58)
about how this was the central region (119:56 - 120:00)
and now as of three days ago they're (119:58 - 120:03)
making a big deal how this (120:00 - 120:05)
turns into this this is the sinnoh (120:03 - 120:07)
region but it wasn't so like i'm (120:05 - 120:08)
assuming that's what i'm saying part of (120:07 - 120:11)
the story is like how did (120:08 - 120:13)
how did it become cinno yeah if they (120:11 - 120:14)
don't answer that (120:13 - 120:17)
i'm going to be bothered i mean they (120:14 - 120:19)
need to explain what happened well that (120:17 - 120:20)
has to be the story right like how did (120:19 - 120:23)
this become cinno and it is team galaxy (120:20 - 120:24)
which yeah (120:23 - 120:28)
i mean obviously (120:24 - 120:28)
i want to talk about the characters will (120:34 - 120:37)
what do you think of these pokemon (120:36 - 120:40)
i mean i like them uh i think (120:37 - 120:42)
that they (120:40 - 120:46)
skillfully chose these ones to show (120:42 - 120:49)
no hms in this game (120:46 - 120:51)
that they particularly selected these (120:49 - 120:53)
ones to point that out and make that (120:51 - 120:55)
clear (120:53 - 120:57)
um i think the introduction of the (120:55 - 120:59)
braviary was real cool (120:57 - 121:00)
showing the character jump off the cliff (120:59 - 121:02)
and then it's like oh i'm actually hang (121:00 - 121:05)
gliding on a braviary i'm a little (121:02 - 121:07)
concerned that the bravery is a seasonal (121:05 - 121:10)
bird that (121:07 - 121:12)
might like you might not be able to (121:10 - 121:14)
access it in the summer if you ever get (121:12 - 121:16)
to summer in this game i don't know (121:14 - 121:17)
because it said it only comes in the (121:16 - 121:18)
winter (121:17 - 121:21)
oh (121:18 - 121:21)
but uh yeah i mean i i think they're all (121:22 - 121:28)
cute i i have no concerns with i mean i (121:25 - 121:29)
gave up on them (121:28 - 121:32)
re-editing which pokemons existed (121:29 - 121:35)
the world all locked terrific i threw in (121:32 - 121:38)
that towel (121:35 - 121:38)
the one thing that uh that that i want (121:39 - 121:44)
to point out (121:42 - 121:46)
is it's very possible i just want people (121:44 - 121:48)
to think about this it's very possible (121:46 - 121:49)
for that growlithe not to evolve into (121:48 - 121:51)
arcanine (121:49 - 121:52)
true correct i think everyone kind of (121:51 - 121:54)
jumped to the assumption that it's going (121:52 - 121:55)
to evolve into arcanine which is a fair (121:54 - 121:57)
assumption but when we live in a world (121:55 - 121:58)
where (121:57 - 122:00)
meowth evolves into berserker and yeah (121:58 - 122:03)
mass evolves into roonregus (122:00 - 122:05)
i think it might be (122:03 - 122:06)
it's like 50 50 at this point whether (122:05 - 122:08)
it's going to evolve yeah i mean it (122:06 - 122:10)
could involve could evolve into anything (122:08 - 122:11)
who knows (122:10 - 122:13)
uh which i think i i really think it (122:11 - 122:15)
evolving into something new is is more (122:13 - 122:19)
exciting than rk9 yeah well it depends (122:15 - 122:21)
if how cool the new arcanine looks and (122:19 - 122:23)
if if greg really cares about the lore (122:21 - 122:25)
and then the first pokemon episode where (122:23 - 122:27)
they look at four legendary pokemon and (122:25 - 122:29)
three of them are the birds and then the (122:27 - 122:31)
other one is arcanine it's like well and (122:29 - 122:34)
also like cinno is like no anime makes (122:31 - 122:36)
me mad anyways like i don't even be (122:34 - 122:37)
started (122:36 - 122:40)
cinno is known for like oh hey (122:37 - 122:42)
even though you've had these pokemon (122:40 - 122:45)
forever here's 16 pokemon evolutions (122:42 - 122:47)
that just they couldn't evolve in the (122:45 - 122:49)
other places it's just just over here (122:47 - 122:51)
yeah well believe me that bothers me so (122:49 - 122:53)
much i can't even explain how much that (122:51 - 122:54)
bugs me (122:53 - 122:56)
ah yeah it it doesn't bug me as much i (122:54 - 123:00)
guess but i i like new pokemon you you (122:56 - 123:01)
throw something too you throw some new (123:00 - 123:04)
pokemon in i'm in i i like how (123:01 - 123:06)
they introduce these pokemon (123:04 - 123:08)
i mean they open that trailer with weird (123:06 - 123:10)
deer (123:08 - 123:11)
and (123:10 - 123:12)
the light hits it in a way where you're (123:11 - 123:14)
like oh it's a stantler and then as it (123:12 - 123:16)
zooms in you're like wait a minute and (123:14 - 123:17)
then they they'd like to leave what i (123:16 - 123:19)
did they they come back to it like the (123:17 - 123:20)
trailer was actually really well done (123:19 - 123:22)
yeah i was like that's awesome and then (123:20 - 123:24)
it was like that stanler looks weird (123:22 - 123:26)
maybe it's like ancient stantler right (123:24 - 123:29)
yeah yeah (123:26 - 123:31)
um (123:29 - 123:31)
yeah and we'll will's right like it's (123:32 - 123:35)
obvious if you need to surf you jump on (123:33 - 123:37)
the basket legion if you need to fly you (123:35 - 123:38)
jump on the braver area if you need to (123:37 - 123:40)
just get around faster it doesn't look (123:38 - 123:41)
like there's a bike it looks like (123:40 - 123:44)
there's a stantler um yeah so it's a (123:41 - 123:46)
weird deer (123:44 - 123:48)
or yeah weird deer sorry it very much um (123:46 - 123:51)
doesn't seem like hms are here (123:48 - 123:53)
good (123:51 - 123:56)
uh okay let's talk about the characters (123:53 - 123:58)
um which i don't actually have in front (123:56 - 124:01)
of me but it's (123:58 - 124:03)
so obvious that the galac the galaxy (124:01 - 124:06)
expected expedition team is team (124:03 - 124:08)
galactic (124:06 - 124:12)
in some form um which people already (124:08 - 124:14)
speculated from the very first trailer (124:12 - 124:19)
that the logos were similar (124:14 - 124:19)
i (124:19 - 124:22)
i don't have thoughts like i guess i'm (124:22 - 124:27)
not i don't care i guess (124:24 - 124:30)
is where i'm coming from but (124:27 - 124:31)
like (124:30 - 124:33)
characters in this game look like (124:31 - 124:36)
characters in diamond and pearl yep (124:33 - 124:41)
uh what's her what's her name silene (124:36 - 124:41)
looks like (124:41 - 124:46)
she's related to cyrus yep with the hair (124:43 - 124:48)
and the facial features and they're heck (124:46 - 124:50)
they're both names start with c (124:48 - 124:53)
like (124:50 - 124:53)
i i i'm sure they're going for some sort (124:54 - 124:57)
of (124:56 - 124:59)
i mean it's diamond pearl the whole (124:57 - 125:01)
thing was time and space i'm sure (124:59 - 125:02)
they're going for something like that i (125:01 - 125:05)
don't know if (125:02 - 125:06)
i don't know if i would purchase this (125:05 - 125:08)
game because i would i was so invested (125:06 - 125:11)
in the the mediocre story that is (125:08 - 125:12)
diamond and pearl that i need to know (125:11 - 125:14)
what happened before that like (125:12 - 125:16)
i just don't care that much in that (125:14 - 125:18)
sense and greg's gonna say it's because (125:16 - 125:20)
you don't like story that's not true it (125:18 - 125:21)
is true (125:20 - 125:23)
it's not it's not don't don't give me a (125:21 - 125:24)
game with a mediocre story and say like (125:23 - 125:26)
well you don't appreciate this mediocre (125:24 - 125:28)
story like no pokemon game has a good (125:26 - 125:30)
enough story that is like worth like i (125:28 - 125:32)
would never tell somebody hey go pick up (125:30 - 125:34)
diamond go pick up black and white (125:32 - 125:36)
you're going to love that story like no (125:34 - 125:37)
they're going to get to the part where (125:36 - 125:39)
you're in the ferris wheel with n and be (125:37 - 125:41)
like what am i playing what is this (125:39 - 125:42)
because you haven't been paying (125:41 - 125:44)
attention because you don't like the (125:42 - 125:45)
story if you've been paying attention (125:44 - 125:46)
you wouldn't know why that's an (125:45 - 125:49)
important part lore of those games are (125:46 - 125:50)
different than the story and the lore (125:49 - 125:52)
and pokemon games are good the the (125:50 - 125:54)
garbage mediocre you must save the world (125:52 - 125:58)
stories are not worth buying for 40 or (125:54 - 125:59)
whatever they are they're just not worth (125:58 - 126:00)
it (125:59 - 126:02)
like like the pokemon company is so good (126:00 - 126:04)
at putting all these pieces together and (126:02 - 126:06)
making you immersed in a world and (126:04 - 126:07)
making you care about pokemon and why (126:06 - 126:09)
the pokemon exists and why these towns (126:07 - 126:12)
exist but the story to story beats and (126:09 - 126:14)
pokemon games are mediocre and they (126:12 - 126:17)
always have been even in pokemon (126:14 - 126:19)
they couldn't do it (126:17 - 126:21)
they're like here is uncle wallace care (126:19 - 126:23)
about this guy oh you found xerneas at (126:21 - 126:25)
the end of pokemon snap we'll never (126:23 - 126:27)
mention uncle charles again or whatever (126:25 - 126:30)
his name was they're talking about the (126:27 - 126:33)
commander that got lost yeah (126:30 - 126:35)
char spoilers (126:33 - 126:37)
there is nothing memorable about the (126:35 - 126:40)
diamond and pearly's pearl storyline (126:37 - 126:42)
captain vince that's it (126:40 - 126:44)
there's nothing memorable about the (126:42 - 126:46)
diamond and pearl storyline that isn't (126:44 - 126:48)
in another game (126:46 - 126:51)
cyrus wants to create a new world (126:48 - 126:52)
you save the world (126:51 - 126:55)
you beat a gym leaders the game is over (126:52 - 126:57)
i mean if you break down every story (126:55 - 126:59)
that way yeah it sounds boring but the (126:57 - 127:01)
lore and the learning of the world is (126:59 - 127:03)
part of the story well i'm not saying (127:01 - 127:05)
the lore or the worlds are bad i think (127:03 - 127:06)
the world building in pokemon is very (127:05 - 127:08)
good i agree i think the lore is very (127:06 - 127:10)
good i think the story beats are bad i (127:08 - 127:11)
don't think they're separate from the (127:10 - 127:12)
story (127:11 - 127:14)
anything x and y has better story beats (127:12 - 127:15)
because at least you remember you have (127:14 - 127:17)
to battle pitbull before you battle (127:15 - 127:18)
lysander with a virtual boy on his face (127:17 - 127:20)
like at least you'll remember that i (127:18 - 127:23)
mean that's character design that's not (127:20 - 127:24)
story (127:23 - 127:26)
i mean because you don't con like you (127:24 - 127:28)
have such a weird division of how you (127:26 - 127:30)
divide things out in your brain that i (127:28 - 127:33)
cannot comprehend it's like the story of (127:30 - 127:34)
harry potter yeah it's boring a kid (127:33 - 127:36)
finds out that he's special and saves (127:34 - 127:38)
the world it's the pokemon story if you (127:36 - 127:41)
include nothing else about that world (127:38 - 127:44)
star wars a kid finds out he's special (127:41 - 127:46)
and saves the universe because nothing (127:44 - 127:48)
else about that world matters it's just (127:46 - 127:50)
a boring retold story that is you right (127:48 - 127:52)
now (127:50 - 127:53)
there are plenty of games where i like (127:52 - 127:56)
the story gone home fire watch yeah (127:53 - 127:58)
they're no longer those are like all (127:56 - 128:00)
emotional feely stories (127:58 - 128:01)
i mean (128:00 - 128:03)
they're all if you break them down to (128:01 - 128:04)
the way you're doing it now you can say (128:03 - 128:06)
these are the same boring tropes that we (128:04 - 128:09)
hear in every other game yeah that is (128:06 - 128:11)
how a lot of stories and video games (128:09 - 128:12)
work (128:11 - 128:15)
i would i would always put a video game (128:12 - 128:18)
story on the sense of if you are playing (128:15 - 128:19)
a game (128:18 - 128:21)
and somebody on like somebody sitting (128:19 - 128:23)
next to you on the couch can get that (128:21 - 128:25)
same amount of enjoyment by watching you (128:23 - 128:28)
play and is invest in the story i would (128:25 - 128:29)
argue that that is a good story and (128:28 - 128:31)
there are plenty of games that do that (128:29 - 128:32)
that exist (128:31 - 128:35)
um like the god of war game had a (128:32 - 128:37)
brilliant story it was very easy for (128:35 - 128:38)
somebody to sit on the couch and be (128:37 - 128:40)
invested the uncharted games do this the (128:38 - 128:42)
last of us does this (128:40 - 128:43)
um (128:42 - 128:46)
the games i mentioned earlier do that i (128:43 - 128:47)
just there's never there's not a (128:46 - 128:48)
situation where two people are sitting (128:47 - 128:50)
on the couch and like my wife is looking (128:48 - 128:52)
over my shoulder being like oh man i (128:50 - 128:53)
can't (128:52 - 128:55)
wha what is barry going to do next (128:53 - 128:59)
no one cares no one cares people do care (128:55 - 129:00)
a lot of people care just because you (128:59 - 129:02)
don't doesn't mean people don't no one (129:00 - 129:05)
is like man i really want to see that (129:02 - 129:06)
like that again (129:05 - 129:08)
there are okay story beats in sword and (129:06 - 129:11)
shield like when hop uh changes his team (129:08 - 129:13)
and when hop gets really upset with beat (129:11 - 129:16)
like a bead like there are some great (129:13 - 129:18)
story moments in a lot of the games (129:16 - 129:19)
there's a lot of great stuff in sun and (129:18 - 129:21)
moon there's a lot of great stuff in all (129:19 - 129:23)
of them (129:21 - 129:25)
yeah they're they the i think the thing (129:23 - 129:28)
is they get so close of almost doing it (129:25 - 129:30)
right and then they give you a 20-minute (129:28 - 129:32)
elevator battle with horrible music and (129:30 - 129:33)
they're like well we don't know how to (129:32 - 129:35)
finish this game but yeah battle mega (129:33 - 129:36)
gardover (129:35 - 129:38)
dynamics gardener (129:36 - 129:41)
got gigantic garb odor yeah (129:38 - 129:44)
they they they're so upset (129:41 - 129:47)
they get so many things like almost (129:44 - 129:48)
there and then they drop the ball but (129:47 - 129:52)
that's every pokemon game that's like (129:48 - 129:56)
90 percent of our media (129:52 - 129:56)
no i think there are games that that (129:56 - 130:00)
that could be there's like 10 of games (129:58 - 130:02)
that are absolutely stellar but most of (130:00 - 130:06)
the stuff that we do is re-tread stuff (130:02 - 130:06)
look it can't all be mass effect (130:08 - 130:14)
it can't all be bioshock (130:10 - 130:16)
one you're right it can't (130:14 - 130:21)
i i don't know if i care enough about (130:16 - 130:21)
[Music] (130:21 - 130:25)
i hope the game convinces me i hope the (130:23 - 130:27)
game has good story hooks where i'm like (130:25 - 130:29)
i need to know (130:27 - 130:34)
how this girl is related to cyrus (130:29 - 130:36)
all right let's talk about the real (130:34 - 130:38)
problematic problem and they're really (130:36 - 130:40)
cool shoes in this game (130:38 - 130:42)
they don't have shoes they just have (130:40 - 130:45)
socks with sandals i know it's horrible (130:42 - 130:48)
toes are freezing just watching it (130:45 - 130:51)
a thousand years ago (130:48 - 130:52)
why is the professor still wearing a (130:51 - 130:54)
white coat (130:52 - 130:58)
that that's not right yeah (130:54 - 131:00)
and also we're assuming lavenden is (130:58 - 131:02)
based off of lavender like is that the (131:00 - 131:05)
tree we're going for or is this before (131:02 - 131:06)
all professors were named after trees (131:05 - 131:09)
for some reason (131:06 - 131:09)
i (131:09 - 131:12)
greg as the story connoisseur (131:13 - 131:19)
let me hear it you see the professor you (131:17 - 131:22)
see the cyrus is probably relative what (131:19 - 131:25)
are you thinking (131:22 - 131:28)
in what way does it make you excited or (131:25 - 131:30)
like i mean so the fact that they are (131:28 - 131:33)
drawing direct paralyzed parallels like (131:30 - 131:34)
this (131:33 - 131:36)
has me excited but also (131:34 - 131:37)
makes me (131:36 - 131:39)
frustrated about introducing new pokemon (131:37 - 131:41)
because i don't know if they're going (131:39 - 131:43)
like i don't know how they're connecting (131:41 - 131:46)
these dots so i have hope because they (131:43 - 131:49)
are clearly like even in the in even in (131:46 - 131:50)
the (131:49 - 131:54)
web page they're like you'll notice that (131:50 - 131:57)
commander komodo is pretty much (131:54 - 131:59)
rowan (131:57 - 132:00)
uh (131:59 - 132:03)
they're the same character model like (132:00 - 132:06)
this is a direct line that we're drawing (132:03 - 132:08)
and so (132:06 - 132:11)
it makes me excited to know that (132:08 - 132:14)
they are going to spend time exploring (132:11 - 132:17)
and hopefully telling the story of what (132:14 - 132:19)
happens to all of these things (132:17 - 132:22)
my fear is that (132:19 - 132:24)
they will leave things off the table (132:22 - 132:26)
like explaining what happens to these (132:24 - 132:27)
pokemon or (132:26 - 132:30)
where they where they went or or what (132:27 - 132:31)
happens (132:30 - 132:33)
um (132:31 - 132:35)
i'm excited that they are drawing these (132:33 - 132:37)
direct lines i'm excited that they're (132:35 - 132:39)
saying hey this is juba life village and (132:37 - 132:41)
then it becomes jupiter life city hey (132:39 - 132:42)
this is (132:41 - 132:44)
commander komodo and then (132:42 - 132:46)
in the future it's professor rowan (132:44 - 132:49)
and i'm curious if (132:46 - 132:51)
they're going to do a thing where (132:49 - 132:53)
they're like and these are the same (132:51 - 132:56)
people because of a time warp whatever (132:53 - 132:58)
like (132:56 - 132:59)
like i'm curious where they're going (132:58 - 133:01)
with it but it does make me excited to (132:59 - 133:03)
sort of figure out what they're doing (133:01 - 133:06)
with the story in this game (133:03 - 133:06)
and i'm trying to figure out like you (133:09 - 133:13)
can draw a direct parallel between (133:10 - 133:16)
uh celine and kamado (133:13 - 133:16)
i'm (133:16 - 133:19)
struggling with who the direct line for (133:16 - 133:21)
professor levington is yeah they say on (133:19 - 133:23)
the website commander komodo who appears (133:21 - 133:24)
in legends archaeologists is the (133:23 - 133:26)
ancestor of rowan who appears in diamond (133:24 - 133:28)
of pearl it seems that other people from (133:26 - 133:29)
the game might also be ancestors to (133:28 - 133:31)
familiar faces they know right so i'm (133:29 - 133:33)
still trying to look at (133:31 - 133:37)
professor lavinton and figure out (133:33 - 133:37)
it's like does he look like barry does (133:37 - 133:42)
he i mean he has a cool poliwhirl hat (133:40 - 133:43)
that's pretty sweet (133:42 - 133:45)
yeah like (133:43 - 133:48)
which again this is like this these are (133:45 - 133:49)
the things they're like really good at (133:48 - 133:51)
they're really good at (133:49 - 133:52)
like (133:51 - 133:55)
incorporating pokemon subtly into the (133:52 - 133:56)
world that once you realize it you're (133:55 - 133:57)
like man that's really clever that's (133:56 - 133:59)
really cool like oh you like you could (133:57 - 134:01)
have just put any hat on him or just (133:59 - 134:03)
give him hair but like you put effort (134:01 - 134:05)
into making like a poly world hat which (134:03 - 134:07)
probably has something to do with his (134:05 - 134:11)
personality or whatever yeah (134:07 - 134:11)
i love the art style (134:13 - 134:16)
i like the art style but i think (134:21 - 134:26)
graphically this game looks awful uh (134:23 - 134:28)
would you do you tree people (134:26 - 134:29)
stop (134:28 - 134:31)
it looks bad you can't sit here and tell (134:29 - 134:32)
me this game these games look (134:31 - 134:34)
graphically good six months in six (134:32 - 134:37)
months it'll they will six months i hope (134:34 - 134:39)
it looks great but pull it up to (134:37 - 134:41)
screenshots of sword and shield doesn't (134:39 - 134:42)
even compare it makes sword and shield (134:41 - 134:45)
look like the trees are are are emmy (134:42 - 134:48)
women and like award-winning trees this (134:45 - 134:51)
is our our our misty (134:48 - 134:54)
uh watercolor past of memory like like (134:51 - 134:57)
it's like like (134:54 - 134:58)
i think graphically these games look (134:57 - 135:01)
like garbage do i think the entire game (134:58 - 135:03)
looks bad no i think the game looks fun (135:01 - 135:04)
but (135:03 - 135:07)
like people are making jokes that like (135:04 - 135:09)
the game looked like a nintendo 64 game (135:07 - 135:10)
and i was like you're out of your mind (135:09 - 135:12)
stop exaggerating and then i pulled up (135:10 - 135:14)
nintendo 64 games and i was like holy (135:12 - 135:15)
cow (135:14 - 135:18)
you're actually kind of right like it is (135:15 - 135:20)
actually bad how (135:18 - 135:22)
how the water looks and how the grass (135:20 - 135:24)
looks and how the ground looks like (135:22 - 135:26)
compare like pull up nintendo 64 games (135:24 - 135:28)
like there are moments in ocarina of (135:26 - 135:30)
time where it looks better than the (135:28 - 135:31)
screenshot of that basket legion in the (135:30 - 135:33)
world it's an artistic (135:31 - 135:35)
choice (135:33 - 135:37)
you just don't like this art style link (135:35 - 135:38)
link me what you're looking at i'm not (135:37 - 135:40)
gonna link it on the podcast you just (135:38 - 135:42)
like look up look up (135:40 - 135:43)
like (135:42 - 135:46)
like look at the pictures i tweeted like (135:43 - 135:47)
i thought people were exaggerating and (135:46 - 135:49)
then i pulled up nintendo 64 games and i (135:47 - 135:51)
was like (135:49 - 135:53)
you're kind of right it's it's just (135:51 - 135:55)
there's a thought that if it's not like (135:53 - 135:57)
sharp high quality high definition (135:55 - 135:59)
graphics it's not good (135:57 - 136:02)
and i i just don't think that that is no (135:59 - 136:04)
i think i think there is a thought that (136:02 - 136:07)
hey you've made games for 25 years how (136:04 - 136:09)
does this game look worse than the last (136:07 - 136:11)
like six games you've made (136:09 - 136:14)
like they're not a new developer but (136:11 - 136:16)
you're saying i i don't think it looks (136:14 - 136:18)
worse i think it looks different i think (136:16 - 136:20)
it's a different art style you didn't (136:18 - 136:21)
tweet something did you (136:20 - 136:25)
i didn't tweet a side by side but like (136:21 - 136:25)
but (136:31 - 136:34)
graphically they look bad (136:32 - 136:36)
they look awful (136:34 - 136:36)
we'll see when the game is actually i (136:37 - 136:40)
mean yeah you're right there's like (136:38 - 136:41)
there's six months more polish is (136:40 - 136:43)
usually the last thing we've had this (136:41 - 136:45)
conversation for sword and shield like (136:43 - 136:47)
sword and shield look really they looked (136:45 - 136:49)
really rough and when they came out they (136:47 - 136:51)
they looked better (136:49 - 136:54)
but sword and shield still looked worse (136:51 - 136:55)
than breath of the wild and breath of (136:54 - 136:57)
the wild came out three years earlier (136:55 - 136:59)
again different teams i understand i get (136:57 - 137:01)
it um (136:59 - 137:03)
how did i never notice the gallerian (137:01 - 137:06)
wheezing on this factory building (137:03 - 137:07)
i tweeted that too (137:06 - 137:08)
well i'm looking at it because i was (137:07 - 137:10)
looking to see if you did your look at (137:08 - 137:11)
these two things together because i'm (137:10 - 137:13)
going to argue about it (137:11 - 137:16)
because i'm looking at nintendo 64. and (137:13 - 137:18)
those games look bad (137:16 - 137:20)
like they don't look they don't look bad (137:18 - 137:22)
they look way worse than what i'm seeing (137:20 - 137:24)
for screenshots here (137:22 - 137:27)
probably this this these set of pictures (137:24 - 137:30)
right here are probably the worst (137:27 - 137:30)
the basket legion in the water (137:31 - 137:35)
the like gastrodon on this beach against (137:35 - 137:40)
this lucario looks absolutely atrocious (137:37 - 137:41)
minus the menus the menus look really (137:40 - 137:44)
really good (137:41 - 137:44)
i mean they look rough (137:44 - 137:48)
yeah they look really bad yeah but we (137:46 - 137:50)
know the polish i mean they don't they (137:48 - 137:52)
they look rough (137:50 - 137:54)
they look unfinished (137:52 - 137:56)
at the end of the day they literally (137:54 - 137:58)
look unfinished this is what i will say (137:56 - 138:00)
at the end of the day i don't care (137:58 - 138:02)
as long as the game is fun as long as (138:00 - 138:04)
the game is good that's all that matters (138:02 - 138:06)
and that's that's a lot that is very (138:04 - 138:08)
much coming from like somebody who is (138:06 - 138:11)
like a nintendo fan like you don't buy (138:08 - 138:13)
a nintendo console because you want pc (138:11 - 138:15)
graphic qualities you don't buy you (138:13 - 138:16)
don't like come to super mario and (138:15 - 138:18)
you're like man i wish super mario (138:16 - 138:21)
looked better you just super mario plays (138:18 - 138:23)
good it's fun it's enjoyable like all (138:21 - 138:24)
that stuff at the end of the day i (138:23 - 138:26)
really don't care about graphics as long (138:24 - 138:28)
as the game is good (138:26 - 138:30)
right like if i cared about graphics i (138:28 - 138:32)
would i would not own a ps4 or an xbox (138:30 - 138:34)
whatever i would buy all my games on pc (138:32 - 138:36)
i would have the world's greatest (138:34 - 138:37)
graphics card i'll have (138:36 - 138:39)
water cooling jet and it will look (138:37 - 138:42)
incredible (138:39 - 138:45)
but i think it is fair (138:42 - 138:45)
to say you are the most profitable (138:45 - 138:51)
video company (138:49 - 138:53)
that makes the like the most money (138:51 - 138:55)
through merch and through cards and (138:53 - 138:58)
through that your last game sold 21 (138:55 - 139:00)
million copies (138:58 - 139:02)
and your game doesn't even look as good (139:00 - 139:04)
as a launch game on the nintendo switch (139:02 - 139:07)
from five years ago (139:04 - 139:08)
like how are you gonna sit here and be (139:07 - 139:11)
like oh well the who like (139:08 - 139:13)
come on (139:11 - 139:15)
it's not like it's not like (139:13 - 139:17)
they haven't been making video games for (139:15 - 139:19)
30-some years how have they not figured (139:17 - 139:21)
this out yet (139:19 - 139:23)
like as much as we make fun of the trees (139:21 - 139:24)
and sword and shield yeah they don't (139:23 - 139:27)
matter but also how like how did they (139:24 - 139:29)
just not fix that (139:27 - 139:31)
was there would they not just have like (139:29 - 139:32)
they don't have an artist that can't (139:31 - 139:34)
make their own custom tree texture to (139:32 - 139:36)
apply to the tree (139:34 - 139:39)
to make it look slightly better (139:36 - 139:39)
i'm not going to worry about it not (139:40 - 139:44)
until i see this everybody says like (139:42 - 139:46)
breath of the wild looks so great and (139:44 - 139:48)
like i don't know what they're judging (139:46 - 139:52)
that off of like i really don't (139:48 - 139:52)
they look like completely different art (139:52 - 139:56)
styles (139:54 - 139:59)
but yeah but the arts the style you are (139:56 - 140:01)
going for is different than the graphics (139:59 - 140:03)
itself like yeah but we just said (140:01 - 140:05)
earlier let's go pikachu diamond and (140:03 - 140:07)
pearl sword and shield and legends they (140:05 - 140:09)
all have different styles yeah but i (140:07 - 140:11)
don't think the graphics look (140:09 - 140:13)
different from each other you don't (140:11 - 140:16)
think this baskeline in the water by (140:13 - 140:18)
itself doesn't look absolutely awful i (140:16 - 140:21)
mean i think it looks unfinished yeah it (140:18 - 140:22)
looks unfinished like if you were gonna (140:21 - 140:24)
say hold up sword and shield and hold up (140:22 - 140:26)
breath of wild and breath of wild looks (140:24 - 140:29)
so much better i don't see that i don't (140:26 - 140:31)
see what people are saying that breath (140:29 - 140:33)
of wild looks so much better than sword (140:31 - 140:35)
and shield does (140:33 - 140:37)
graphically i don't see it i don't see (140:35 - 140:40)
how what you're comparing (140:37 - 140:43)
this is an audio podcast so we can't (140:40 - 140:44)
really spend too much time looking at (140:43 - 140:46)
breath of the wild pictures and i don't (140:44 - 140:48)
see what you're comparing like i'm (140:46 - 140:51)
seeing two vastly different art styles (140:48 - 140:53)
but i'm not saying (140:51 - 140:56)
i'm not seeing graphically how one is (140:53 - 141:00)
graphically superior (140:56 - 141:00)
i think if if pokemon games didn't sell (141:05 - 141:12)
so incredibly well (141:08 - 141:15)
i don't think people would care as much (141:12 - 141:17)
so i would put it differently i think if (141:15 - 141:19)
they're they didn't sell as well they (141:17 - 141:21)
wouldn't put an unfinished product in (141:19 - 141:24)
front of people but with the sales that (141:21 - 141:26)
they know that they're going to get they (141:24 - 141:28)
can feel confident putting an unfinished (141:26 - 141:30)
product in front of people knowing that (141:28 - 141:31)
that's not really going to lose them any (141:30 - 141:34)
sales (141:31 - 141:36)
a lot of game developers (141:34 - 141:38)
change their game tons of times before (141:36 - 141:41)
it comes out and we have a long time (141:38 - 141:43)
before this game comes out (141:41 - 141:45)
true (141:43 - 141:45)
but yeah if they had done this pokemon (141:48 - 141:52)
presents and didn't show any pokemon (141:49 - 141:52)
arceus (141:52 - 141:55)
legends pokemon legends arceus that that (141:52 - 141:56)
would have been (141:55 - 141:58)
that would have been a bad discussion (141:56 - 142:00)
yeah that would have been like coveted (141:58 - 142:02)
killed it it's it's going to be delayed (142:00 - 142:05)
it's not going to come out bad news yeah (142:02 - 142:06)
but in a sense though they're i mean (142:05 - 142:08)
they're controlling what they're showing (142:06 - 142:09)
yeah (142:08 - 142:11)
and they like the screenshots i tweeted (142:09 - 142:13)
were official screenshots that they (142:11 - 142:15)
provided press (142:13 - 142:16)
and i look at these screenshots and i'm (142:15 - 142:18)
like you couldn't (142:16 - 142:19)
you can get us better what like this is (142:18 - 142:21)
the best you got the one thing that (142:19 - 142:23)
stands out to me is it in the in the (142:21 - 142:24)
screenshots i tweeted if you look at the (142:23 - 142:26)
menu it's the one with this it's the one (142:24 - 142:29)
with the the wheezing on the building (142:26 - 142:32)
like the menu looks polished and good (142:29 - 142:34)
yeah i mean yeah it's a menu but it (142:32 - 142:36)
looks very crisp very clean (142:34 - 142:38)
it almost looks like it's from a (142:36 - 142:40)
different game compared to like (142:38 - 142:44)
the lan the standard picture of (142:40 - 142:44)
weird deer here with like this like (142:44 - 142:51)
paper craft tree behind it (142:47 - 142:51)
again i i don't really care about (142:56 - 143:00)
graphics i play (142:59 - 143:02)
tooth don't roll like i don't know why (143:00 - 143:04)
you're rolling your eyes i put 2 000 (143:02 - 143:06)
hours into ultrasound ultra moon on the (143:04 - 143:07)
3ds you want to talk about something (143:06 - 143:10)
that looks like absolute but it's (143:07 - 143:12)
literally every three days (143:10 - 143:13)
because you're the person that (143:12 - 143:15)
constantly brings this up and then (143:13 - 143:17)
you're the person that constantly says i (143:15 - 143:19)
don't care about this we never bring up (143:17 - 143:21)
your graphic concerns we never bring up (143:19 - 143:22)
your stuff you are the one that goes out (143:21 - 143:24)
there (143:22 - 143:26)
expectations i think i don't care about (143:24 - 143:29)
graphics when you clearly do care about (143:26 - 143:32)
graphics graphics don't impact your (143:29 - 143:34)
enjoyment but you base things off of (143:32 - 143:37)
graphics like you can't say i don't care (143:34 - 143:38)
about it and then have spent this entire (143:37 - 143:40)
time talking about how crappy they look (143:38 - 143:42)
i think it would be a disservice to all (143:40 - 143:44)
our listeners to ignore the fact that (143:42 - 143:45)
these games look awful (143:44 - 143:48)
they don't look awful they look awful (143:45 - 143:49)
they look awful (143:48 - 143:51)
i don't know how you can sit here and (143:49 - 143:52)
say the switch has been out for five (143:51 - 143:54)
years and be like yep this is acceptable (143:52 - 143:56)
like they look bad they look visually (143:54 - 143:58)
bad (143:56 - 143:59)
i don't know i like their service really (143:58 - 144:03)
like lots of kiting through like (143:59 - 144:05)
super mario odyssey like there are so (144:03 - 144:07)
many games that have existed on the (144:05 - 144:09)
switch that blows these out of the water (144:07 - 144:12)
i and it would be a disservice if we (144:09 - 144:14)
suck here (144:12 - 144:15)
that big of a deal i am not seeing what (144:14 - 144:18)
you are saying is so graphically (144:15 - 144:20)
graphically not art style graphically (144:18 - 144:23)
different between these games (144:20 - 144:25)
okay (144:23 - 144:25)
i i think they i think they look like (144:25 - 144:30)
garbage graphically (144:27 - 144:30)
i and i've said on this podcast before i (144:31 - 144:34)
don't think game freak is the world's (144:33 - 144:37)
best developer far from it no they're (144:34 - 144:38)
not (144:37 - 144:40)
they're not they never have been play (144:38 - 144:41)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee where (144:40 - 144:44)
you can barely like it's surprisingly (144:41 - 144:45)
that you're surprising that your (144:44 - 144:47)
character can walk around properly (144:45 - 144:49)
because it gets stuck on every sign and (144:47 - 144:51)
every person too close together like i i (144:49 - 144:54)
am um well aware that they are they are (144:51 - 144:56)
not the best developer and to go back to (144:54 - 144:57)
the breath of the wild thing monolith (144:56 - 145:00)
software helped (144:57 - 145:01)
that nintendo team that worked on breath (145:00 - 145:03)
of the wild with the map design and and (145:01 - 145:06)
a lot of in a lot of what breath of the (145:03 - 145:09)
wild does (145:06 - 145:09)
and i think people (145:14 - 145:18)
wouldn't care as much (145:16 - 145:21)
if pokemon wasn't the money-making (145:18 - 145:23)
machine that they are they make so much (145:21 - 145:26)
money i i don't (145:23 - 145:28)
they literally sold 21 million copies i (145:26 - 145:32)
don't i don't know if people like if (145:28 - 145:36)
i don't know that fans of any game (145:32 - 145:36)
like you aren't hearing from (145:37 - 145:41)
the (145:39 - 145:41)
20 million people that bought that game (145:41 - 145:45)
you're hearing from the one million (145:43 - 145:47)
people who are invested but in a (145:45 - 145:50)
situation where it bothers them (145:47 - 145:52)
it's it's hard to look at it's hard to (145:50 - 145:53)
look at pokemon and be like you make (145:52 - 145:54)
millions and millions of dollars why do (145:53 - 145:58)
your games look like garbage (145:54 - 145:58)
that's just not where they're investing (145:59 - 146:01)
their (146:00 - 146:02)
i know that's not where they're (146:01 - 146:03)
investing look half the people that (146:02 - 146:05)
probably complain about graphics they (146:03 - 146:07)
probably jump on the internet smash (146:05 - 146:08)
their keyboard a bunch of times as a (146:07 - 146:09)
complaint and then they go over and they (146:08 - 146:12)
play roblox roblox also looks like (146:09 - 146:13)
garbage (146:12 - 146:15)
minecraft (146:13 - 146:17)
looks good but it's also like a giant (146:15 - 146:19)
pixelated roblox (146:17 - 146:22)
though yeah like i would say they don't (146:19 - 146:23)
look like garbage because that's the art (146:22 - 146:26)
style they're going for (146:23 - 146:26)
roblox (146:27 - 146:30)
i think i've never played bad blocks (146:28 - 146:33)
i think it looks awful (146:30 - 146:35)
looks like legos (146:33 - 146:38)
yeah it looks like legos (146:35 - 146:38)
but yeah i mean like there's a huge (146:40 - 146:43)
difference between (146:42 - 146:45)
minecraft and (146:43 - 146:49)
gears of war (146:45 - 146:49)
correct (146:49 - 146:53)
two different art styles (146:50 - 146:53)
what even is roblox it's like minecraft (146:57 - 147:01)
the thing about roblox is you can (147:02 - 147:06)
make things for roblox you can make (147:04 - 147:09)
games inside of roblox and then you can (147:06 - 147:12)
sell those games so roblox makes a ton (147:09 - 147:14)
of money because it like at its core (147:12 - 147:17)
it's a platform but inside it's like (147:14 - 147:19)
i can buy a (147:17 - 147:21)
pokemon game inside roblox that's not (147:19 - 147:24)
called pokemon it's called (147:21 - 147:27)
pokey bros (147:24 - 147:27)
it's very very popular i'm trying to (147:29 - 147:33)
actually find an actual screenshot of (147:31 - 147:35)
this game and it's incredibly difficult (147:33 - 147:38)
because there's just a lot of banners (147:35 - 147:41)
they gotta make their money (147:38 - 147:41)
do you wanna talk about the (147:41 - 147:44)
crafting (147:43 - 147:47)
i mean there's crafting and i don't (147:44 - 147:51)
understand why but sure (147:47 - 147:51)
well going back to roblox and minecraft (147:51 - 147:55)
and all these other games i mean i (147:54 - 147:57)
wanted it's what i asked for in a (147:55 - 147:58)
pokemon game so (147:57 - 148:01)
i got what i wanted (147:58 - 148:05)
because you're crafting pokeballs (148:01 - 148:05)
yeah they they showed crafting they (148:06 - 148:09)
showed that the characters could (148:08 - 148:11)
actually get hit and take damage (148:09 - 148:14)
yeah you get attacked um they showed (148:11 - 148:15)
that there was like a strong style and (148:14 - 148:18)
an agile style which to me the first (148:15 - 148:19)
thing when when they showed that i was (148:18 - 148:21)
like oh they really run in with this (148:19 - 148:24)
hershey food gimmick (148:21 - 148:24)
i eh that is an old (148:26 - 148:31)
that is an old advancement of turn style (148:28 - 148:33)
combat that has (148:31 - 148:35)
that they're like adopting for this that (148:33 - 148:37)
certain moves will (148:35 - 148:38)
will move you higher up in the (148:37 - 148:41)
initiative order like this was this is (148:38 - 148:42)
the thing that i've run into final (148:41 - 148:44)
fantasy tactics that i'm like okay so (148:42 - 148:46)
they're they're finally including this (148:44 - 148:47)
in their (148:46 - 148:49)
turn-based system to make it (148:47 - 148:52)
more action based it's not not like a (148:49 - 148:55)
sudden new development (148:52 - 148:57)
it's interesting i mean i'm curious how (148:55 - 149:00)
it changes things the idea that (148:57 - 149:02)
the moves you pick would allow you to go (149:00 - 149:05)
more times before a slower opponent that (149:02 - 149:07)
picked a heavier move i mean it's an (149:05 - 149:09)
interesting thing to add it does make it (149:07 - 149:13)
slightly more actiony (149:09 - 149:13)
i'm interested to see if it actually is (149:13 - 149:17)
fun to do (149:15 - 149:19)
yeah (149:17 - 149:20)
the other thing is like the whole point (149:19 - 149:22)
of the game is to complete the pokedex (149:20 - 149:24)
the world's first pokedex or whatever (149:22 - 149:26)
they called it um they show they have (149:24 - 149:28)
like a screenshot of like research tests (149:26 - 149:30)
for shinx and it's um catch one catch (149:28 - 149:33)
two four ten fifteen pokemon (149:30 - 149:36)
um and then it shows they they caught (149:33 - 149:37)
three shanks (149:36 - 149:40)
and it says number of shanks defeated (149:37 - 149:43)
one two four ten fifteen (149:40 - 149:44)
so it (149:43 - 149:46)
this part kind of reminded me of pokemon (149:44 - 149:47)
snap (149:46 - 149:48)
yep um (149:47 - 149:50)
where it was like i did feel that (149:48 - 149:54)
do these tasks over and over again (149:50 - 149:56)
go back like number four (149:54 - 149:58)
and do these things in this region (149:56 - 150:00)
number forms you registered like (149:58 - 150:03)
probably male female (150:00 - 150:06)
um so like that looked cool and that (150:03 - 150:08)
seems to have like some replayability i (150:06 - 150:10)
would assume that (150:08 - 150:13)
you probably don't need to do all 15 or (150:10 - 150:15)
25 for each one number of times you've (150:13 - 150:17)
seen bite i don't know if you (150:15 - 150:20)
need to see 25 bytes in order to like (150:17 - 150:23)
100 the game (150:20 - 150:23)
i'm (150:27 - 150:31)
not big on crafting but i don't know i (150:29 - 150:33)
guess it'll be fine like i wasn't big on (150:31 - 150:34)
crafting when they announced it for (150:33 - 150:35)
animal crossing and then in animal (150:34 - 150:38)
crossing it was like okay it was okay i (150:35 - 150:41)
did some of it but it wasn't super (150:38 - 150:43)
it gets it sort of gets annoying when (150:41 - 150:45)
you have (150:43 - 150:47)
a ton of recipes you're like okay what (150:45 - 150:48)
do i (150:47 - 150:50)
need for this one again and then you're (150:48 - 150:52)
like okay i only have seven of those so (150:50 - 150:54)
i have to go out and find them and then (150:52 - 150:56)
halfway through i've forgotten (150:54 - 150:58)
uh it depends on how they sort of (150:56 - 151:00)
organize crafting how complicated it (150:58 - 151:04)
gets like crafting in games is not (151:00 - 151:05)
not my favorite thing (151:04 - 151:08)
it's fine i'll do it but (151:05 - 151:10)
that there's never been a crafting (151:08 - 151:12)
mechanic that i've been like i can't (151:10 - 151:15)
wait to craft (151:12 - 151:17)
nothing in final fantasy 14 you don't (151:15 - 151:19)
like though i hate crafting i hate (151:17 - 151:20)
making clothes (151:19 - 151:22)
i hate it all i hate the crafting system (151:20 - 151:25)
and final fantasy 14 (151:22 - 151:27)
so much (151:25 - 151:30)
it it yeah i do not like it i hate it (151:27 - 151:33)
it's not great (151:30 - 151:33)
what was the other thing uh they showed (151:35 - 151:38)
different outfits so (151:36 - 151:40)
character customization although i don't (151:38 - 151:42)
think they showed (151:40 - 151:45)
in color did show different outfit (151:42 - 151:47)
um (151:45 - 151:50)
there's a pre-order bonus of heavy balls (151:47 - 151:52)
which is funny because they show a (151:50 - 151:54)
screenshot of a heavy ball being thrown (151:52 - 151:55)
out of starly (151:54 - 151:57)
yeah (151:55 - 151:59)
not heavy uh the one thing i did notice (151:57 - 152:01)
on the outside this will probably change (151:59 - 152:03)
i'm sure but the pre-order also gives (152:01 - 152:07)
you the growl of kimono the outfit yeah (152:03 - 152:09)
um they have like a minus button that (152:07 - 152:10)
looks to be like an it either looks like (152:09 - 152:13)
an iphone or an egg incubator i can't (152:10 - 152:16)
tell and then the up button (152:13 - 152:18)
looks to be your menu because there's (152:16 - 152:21)
like a pokeball uh profile and then uh (152:18 - 152:23)
apricorn or something and then the (152:21 - 152:25)
bottom one (152:23 - 152:26)
is like a journal so i would assume (152:25 - 152:29)
that's like your pokedex yeah (152:26 - 152:31)
uh and then they have this monster (152:29 - 152:33)
hunter like (152:31 - 152:35)
menu on the right hand side of like i'm (152:33 - 152:37)
assuming flipping through your pokeballs (152:35 - 152:40)
or maybe summoning your pokemon (152:37 - 152:43)
so (152:40 - 152:43)
yeah (152:43 - 152:47)
the cell phone does look like a weird (152:44 - 152:50)
incubator but it could be (152:47 - 152:54)
also like if you have (152:50 - 152:54)
if it's like a pokemon box and in the (152:54 - 152:59)
reason you can only catch up to 30 like (152:57 - 153:01)
a snap is it could be a box because you (152:59 - 153:02)
see how there's three dots yeah they (153:01 - 153:05)
have three pokemon and not six you can (153:02 - 153:07)
only fill up so much and then you have (153:05 - 153:08)
to go back to base camp because you have (153:07 - 153:10)
no more space like i could see that kind (153:08 - 153:12)
of like how they did for snap like well (153:10 - 153:14)
you took 30 pictures you're halfway (153:12 - 153:16)
through the route so (153:14 - 153:17)
we're going to pull you back because (153:16 - 153:18)
you're out of film i could see that (153:17 - 153:20)
being up you're out of space because it (153:18 - 153:22)
does i don't think there's going to be (153:20 - 153:24)
like a pc (153:22 - 153:28)
type situation because it's in the past (153:24 - 153:28)
i don't know hoopa threw a pc through (153:28 - 153:31)
the portal it landed (153:30 - 153:34)
but you blame everything on hoopa i feel (153:31 - 153:36)
like you can at this place koopa can't (153:34 - 153:38)
do everything (153:36 - 153:38)
that they haven't really said that hoopa (153:39 - 153:44)
can do time travel (153:41 - 153:47)
that's why celebi helps the hoop at a (153:44 - 153:51)
time travel then he sets up the ring (153:47 - 153:53)
yeah but hoop like (153:51 - 153:55)
hoopa can only set up rings in space so (153:53 - 153:57)
you travel back in time hoopa can do (153:55 - 154:00)
what with that (153:57 - 154:02)
maybe hoopa sets up the ring and then (154:00 - 154:03)
celebi (154:02 - 154:05)
pulls something from the past and then (154:03 - 154:08)
throws it through the ring i don't know (154:05 - 154:08)
and you're gonna complain about story (154:08 - 154:12)
and that's the best you can come up with (154:10 - 154:14)
i'm not a story writer (154:12 - 154:17)
i'm just here to complain (154:14 - 154:19)
this is the the most true statement i'm (154:17 - 154:23)
just here to complain (154:19 - 154:23)
they did not use the words open world (154:24 - 154:27)
once again (154:26 - 154:28)
nope (154:27 - 154:30)
we are eight months into this game they (154:28 - 154:33)
have never mentioned (154:30 - 154:35)
wrote down or tweeted the words open (154:33 - 154:37)
world although they did show the overall (154:35 - 154:39)
of the map and it was broken into (154:37 - 154:41)
sections (154:39 - 154:43)
so i think will is correct that this is (154:41 - 154:45)
more monster hunter than we think (154:43 - 154:47)
and that you will go back to a base camp (154:45 - 154:50)
jubalife and you will pick different (154:47 - 154:53)
areas to go to specifically (154:50 - 154:55)
um it if it's if it's open world cool if (154:53 - 154:57)
it's not open world i don't think this (154:55 - 154:59)
is that big of a deal like i wouldn't (154:57 - 155:00)
consider sword and shield open world (154:59 - 155:01)
games but (155:00 - 155:03)
exploring all of the crown tundra (155:01 - 155:04)
exploring all of the isle of armor (155:03 - 155:07)
that's fine it's fun it's good i don't (155:04 - 155:11)
need to go from the crown tundra through (155:07 - 155:13)
pots wick or whatever it's called (155:11 - 155:15)
post wick (155:13 - 155:18)
like i'll just fly to it it's fine (155:15 - 155:18)
like open world is such a generic (155:21 - 155:28)
throwaway term at this point (155:24 - 155:29)
theoretically technically once you beat (155:28 - 155:31)
a pokemon game you can go wherever you (155:29 - 155:34)
want you can walk from the eighth gym to (155:31 - 155:38)
the first gym if you really wanted to (155:34 - 155:38)
i don't know (155:41 - 155:43)
it looks good it looks fine (155:45 - 155:49)
i have a little bit (155:48 - 155:51)
i'm very excited for the game i think (155:49 - 155:53)
i i i (155:51 - 155:55)
there's enough very new things in the (155:53 - 155:56)
game that i'm like i want to see how (155:55 - 155:58)
they work i don't know if i'm going to (155:56 - 155:59)
like it (155:58 - 156:01)
but i mean yeah that's how i feel like (155:59 - 156:02)
it (156:01 - 156:04)
when i think of action rpgs i always (156:02 - 156:06)
think of like (156:04 - 156:09)
devil my cry or bayonetta or (156:06 - 156:12)
even like the new god of wars very (156:09 - 156:14)
action rpg like literally every game at (156:12 - 156:16)
this point's an rpg every (156:14 - 156:17)
every video game that comes out there's (156:16 - 156:19)
like level up systems and power ups and (156:17 - 156:20)
skill trees (156:19 - 156:21)
uh (156:20 - 156:24)
and i'm not a huge fan of those games (156:21 - 156:26)
personally you know what these what this (156:24 - 156:27)
reminds me of the entire time i was (156:26 - 156:29)
watching it it reminded me of like (156:27 - 156:32)
final fantasy 15. like somebody at game (156:29 - 156:34)
freak finally played uh like somebody i (156:32 - 156:36)
gave like the people at game freak grew (156:34 - 156:38)
up with final fantasy and they were like (156:36 - 156:40)
ah turn-based rpgs and then they were (156:38 - 156:42)
like wait a minute after final fantasy (156:40 - 156:44)
10 they stopped doing turn-based and (156:42 - 156:46)
there's no action maybe we should do (156:44 - 156:47)
that (156:46 - 156:49)
uh not good (156:47 - 156:52)
and i love final fantasy 15. it's one of (156:49 - 156:53)
my favorite games i know bad story i (156:52 - 156:56)
mean to play it was awful a bad story in (156:53 - 156:57)
that game too but the lore and (156:56 - 157:00)
everything was fine uh (156:57 - 157:02)
but i hated the combat in 15. but i (157:00 - 157:04)
sludged through it anyways because (157:02 - 157:06)
everything else about that game was good (157:04 - 157:08)
uh but (157:06 - 157:10)
i personally like turn-based stuff i (157:08 - 157:13)
like turn-based stuff a lot obviously i (157:10 - 157:15)
prefer it myself so by removing the turn (157:13 - 157:17)
base (157:15 - 157:20)
i have hesitations but i mean i'll try (157:17 - 157:21)
it (157:20 - 157:22)
i mean (157:21 - 157:24)
it's hard to say how much of the turn (157:22 - 157:26)
base is gone (157:24 - 157:29)
because it's still clearly (157:26 - 157:31)
one one one one unless you pick a style (157:29 - 157:33)
that will go two two one (157:31 - 157:36)
but like the amount of real time (157:33 - 157:38)
decisions you have to make like it (157:36 - 157:39)
didn't i didn't get the sense like the (157:38 - 157:41)
game (157:39 - 157:43)
doesn't pause for you to choose a move (157:41 - 157:46)
and choose a style it it felt very much (157:43 - 157:47)
to me like (157:46 - 157:48)
the battle stops when you're picking (157:47 - 157:50)
your move you choose between the two and (157:48 - 157:52)
then it loads up the thing and you can (157:50 - 157:54)
continue down that path at any time you (157:52 - 157:56)
can pause the combat to change it again (157:54 - 157:59)
so i don't know how real timey it will (157:56 - 158:00)
actually feel (157:59 - 158:02)
that's um i don't know if you either of (158:00 - 158:04)
you played bravely default (158:02 - 158:06)
no i have played bravia default but it (158:04 - 158:08)
like bravely default was (158:06 - 158:10)
it's turn based but it's (158:08 - 158:12)
kind of not because you can you can (158:10 - 158:15)
commit all your moves up front (158:12 - 158:17)
um so like (158:15 - 158:18)
you can (158:17 - 158:21)
use what's called your you can brave (158:18 - 158:23)
so you can say like i'm gonna attack one (158:21 - 158:25)
two three four (158:23 - 158:27)
and then because i'm faster than my (158:25 - 158:28)
opponent i'm going to do all four turns (158:27 - 158:30)
first and then if they're dead and they (158:28 - 158:32)
can't attack then the battle's over on (158:30 - 158:33)
i1 (158:32 - 158:35)
um so you do one two three four and then (158:33 - 158:37)
they survive and then if they can just (158:35 - 158:39)
attack and then it's their turn again (158:37 - 158:41)
and then you're you you braved so you (158:39 - 158:43)
can't do anything so they attack again (158:41 - 158:46)
um or you can default where you can (158:43 - 158:48)
save your turns (158:46 - 158:51)
so you can save up for a bigger move (158:48 - 158:55)
so the agile slash strong seemed very (158:51 - 158:57)
much like that (158:55 - 158:57)
strong style and agile i don't know i (159:02 - 159:07)
i i feel like i don't really have any (159:05 - 159:08)
questions about diamond pearl they (159:07 - 159:10)
showed it and i was like yep that's (159:08 - 159:11)
exactly what it is i mean i have (159:10 - 159:13)
questions about like the hideaway yeah (159:11 - 159:14)
and like the more details and obviously (159:13 - 159:16)
like how the bases will work and how (159:14 - 159:18)
they affect the hideaway and (159:16 - 159:20)
um yeah yeah or like is there gonna be (159:18 - 159:21)
more clothing like what's the pokedex (159:20 - 159:23)
looking like that kind of stuff but like (159:21 - 159:26)
none of those questions i feel like (159:23 - 159:28)
are questions that are like well (159:26 - 159:30)
if they don't have six outfits i'm not (159:28 - 159:32)
buying the game it's like (159:30 - 159:33)
like i like i i am genuinely curious (159:32 - 159:34)
about the pokedex but it's not going to (159:33 - 159:36)
stop me from buying the game like it (159:34 - 159:38)
looks good with arceus i'm just like i (159:36 - 159:40)
feel like you gave me way more questions (159:38 - 159:42)
and i still don't know what this game is (159:40 - 159:44)
fully doing good they they succeeded (159:42 - 159:46)
because now you're curious (159:44 - 159:49)
yeah i am i'm also i i like past past (159:46 - 159:52)
the game itself i'm curious for sales (159:49 - 159:53)
like when you look at sword and shield (159:52 - 159:55)
it sold 21 million but there's two (159:53 - 159:56)
copies of that game when you look at sun (159:55 - 159:58)
and moon they sold 16 million again two (159:56 - 160:01)
copies of that game like why did why did (159:58 - 160:02)
they not do two copies why is it only (160:01 - 160:04)
one like it's game freak they could have (160:02 - 160:07)
easily been like this is the (160:04 - 160:10)
old-fashioned arceus and this is (160:07 - 160:13)
slightly western arch like they could (160:10 - 160:15)
have just put any subtitle on and sell (160:13 - 160:17)
two versions of this game (160:15 - 160:18)
if they wanted to (160:17 - 160:19)
we'll see (160:18 - 160:21)
it's kind of weird that they're like so (160:19 - 160:24)
does one copy of arceus sell 10 million (160:21 - 160:26)
does one copy of arceus sell 8 million (160:24 - 160:28)
does it only sell 2 million like should (160:26 - 160:31)
have they should they have put 2 out (160:28 - 160:33)
i mean i think the thing that we don't (160:31 - 160:37)
know is how many of the two million (160:33 - 160:38)
or how many of like the 21 million of (160:37 - 160:40)
sword and shield are people buying both (160:38 - 160:42)
copies right right like we don't know (160:40 - 160:44)
what that percentage is we know our (160:42 - 160:45)
audience the people who listen to the (160:44 - 160:47)
podcast we know a lot of them buy two (160:45 - 160:48)
copies because they're listening to a (160:47 - 160:50)
pokemon but (160:48 - 160:52)
we are (160:50 - 160:52)
a fraction of a percent (160:52 - 160:56)
of people (160:54 - 160:58)
uh so it's hard to say it's hard to (160:56 - 161:00)
speculate what a (160:58 - 161:03)
completely different style (161:00 - 161:07)
game where there's only one of them (161:03 - 161:09)
cells like the closest parallel we could (161:07 - 161:12)
get are things like pokemon conquest (161:09 - 161:14)
which or i was gonna say coliseum or (161:12 - 161:16)
gale of darkness or calcium or gala (161:14 - 161:18)
darkness where it is a different game (161:16 - 161:21)
style and it is a one-off only game and (161:18 - 161:22)
we could (161:21 - 161:23)
maybe (161:22 - 161:25)
draw some parallels but i mean we're (161:23 - 161:28)
just really guessing at that point like (161:25 - 161:30)
these didn't sell great but they sold (161:28 - 161:32)
good enough and gale of darkness and (161:30 - 161:34)
coliseum didn't really i mean i think (161:32 - 161:35)
they i think they stole two to three (161:34 - 161:37)
million respectively but also there (161:35 - 161:38)
wasn't that many game cubes compared to (161:37 - 161:40)
that many switches there are a lot of (161:38 - 161:42)
switches out there yeah a lot more than (161:40 - 161:45)
gamecube i mean gamecube had a handle (161:42 - 161:46)
but (161:45 - 161:50)
the switch is very very popular anyways (161:46 - 161:52)
uh i think that's it (161:50 - 161:54)
was there anything we missed from the (161:52 - 161:55)
trailers (161:54 - 161:56)
uh (161:55 - 161:58)
i'm trying to see how much conquest sold (161:56 - 162:00)
and that's not easy uh they put out that (161:58 - 162:03)
nintendo switch dialga palkia edition (162:00 - 162:05)
that's coming out november 5th i'd be (162:03 - 162:07)
more interested if it was the led model (162:05 - 162:08)
yeah (162:07 - 162:12)
yeah i i was like oh a new switch oh (162:08 - 162:14)
it's a switch light meaning i am not (162:12 - 162:16)
going to buy it uh conquest apparently (162:14 - 162:17)
sold (162:16 - 162:22)
341 000 copies in japan geez (162:17 - 162:22)
not a lot i don't think conquest sold (162:23 - 162:27)
very well i think part of the reason why (162:25 - 162:29)
conquest got hurt is because it was one (162:27 - 162:32)
of the last ds games when a 3ds came out (162:29 - 162:34)
yeah (162:32 - 162:36)
still a fun game though i like conquest (162:34 - 162:38)
a whole lot (162:36 - 162:39)
is there anything i'm looking at this (162:38 - 162:42)
list i can't believe chat is in pokemon (162:39 - 162:45)
legends arcus (162:42 - 162:47)
finally how many pokemon you think are (162:45 - 162:49)
gaming legends (162:47 - 162:51)
uh (162:49 - 162:51)
i would say 300. i'd say between 300 and (162:52 - 162:57)
400 yeah (162:55 - 162:59)
i'm gonna say 300 as well (162:57 - 163:02)
because i think like things like rotom (162:59 - 163:05)
are not going to be in that game (163:02 - 163:08)
no you wrote tom's how you got the pc (163:05 - 163:11)
there's no pc (163:08 - 163:11)
i i have no backwards there's no motor (163:13 - 163:17)
there may maybe they'll introduce the (163:15 - 163:18)
who (163:17 - 163:21)
he suing rotom form which is a steam (163:18 - 163:22)
engine (163:21 - 163:25)
i still think they're the reason these (163:22 - 163:27)
games are too close so close together is (163:25 - 163:29)
there's going to be like this opens up (163:27 - 163:31)
an area in each other's games if it (163:29 - 163:34)
reads your data and it's probably um i (163:31 - 163:36)
also have a suspicion that pokemon (163:34 - 163:39)
legends arceus is going to be a (163:36 - 163:40)
like (163:39 - 163:43)
move to maybe more chapter based gaming (163:40 - 163:46)
and then maybe the next uh (163:43 - 163:49)
installment is also based in the past (163:46 - 163:51)
and it takes you through a continuing (163:49 - 163:53)
story (163:51 - 163:53)
of how all the history and growth (163:54 - 164:01)
go extinct yes (163:58 - 164:03)
uh (164:01 - 164:05)
yeah (164:03 - 164:07)
i get very let's go pikachu let's go (164:05 - 164:09)
eevee vibes from this where it's like we (164:07 - 164:10)
took a small team we needed to make (164:09 - 164:12)
something this is a (164:10 - 164:13)
project (164:12 - 164:15)
but (164:13 - 164:16)
only time will tell most of the team is (164:15 - 164:19)
on gen 9. uh yeah i mean (164:16 - 164:21)
probably i don't know it depends on how (164:19 - 164:23)
big the game is like i can't make that (164:21 - 164:25)
determination if it's a 20-hour game if (164:23 - 164:28)
it's a 10-hour game it's a 50-hour game (164:25 - 164:29)
yeah i don't know (164:28 - 164:31)
like it's hard to say how much of it is (164:29 - 164:34)
scripted driven how much of it is (164:31 - 164:35)
once you're in those regions you have a (164:34 - 164:38)
lot of time and space to explore like (164:35 - 164:40)
there are just way too many questions at (164:38 - 164:42)
this point about arceus (164:40 - 164:45)
um (164:42 - 164:45)
like i like i have no idea where they're (164:45 - 164:48)
going with it i like what they've showed (164:46 - 164:50)
though (164:48 - 164:52)
yeah i mean at least they've done the (164:50 - 164:53)
one thing (164:52 - 164:55)
that they probably wanted to do (164:53 - 164:57)
which was to get people (164:55 - 164:59)
who are (164:57 - 165:02)
tired of the same pokemon formula (164:59 - 165:05)
interested in this yeah (165:02 - 165:05)
i'm not tired of the old pokemon either (165:06 - 165:12)
clearly i like it a lot (165:08 - 165:12)
and you know coming out every (165:13 - 165:18)
couple years i mean big big games like (165:15 - 165:20)
i'm that it always scratches that itch (165:18 - 165:21)
but (165:20 - 165:23)
but you look you look at series like (165:21 - 165:25)
final fantasy i mean the first six final (165:23 - 165:27)
fantasies are pretty similar (165:25 - 165:29)
and then seven was when that big change (165:27 - 165:31)
was and they took that until ten and (165:29 - 165:33)
then eleven they throw that out the (165:31 - 165:35)
window and they're like here's an mmo (165:33 - 165:37)
it's different than the past (165:35 - 165:39)
and then twelve was (165:37 - 165:40)
completely different (165:39 - 165:43)
here's the mmo combat system that didn't (165:40 - 165:45)
work in 11 and it doesn't work in 12. (165:43 - 165:47)
and then 13 was like (165:45 - 165:49)
here's just a (165:47 - 165:51)
20-hour tutorial good luck yeah (165:49 - 165:53)
and then 14 was like here's an mmo again (165:51 - 165:55)
here's an mmo that's so bad we're gonna (165:53 - 165:57)
blow it up and start over again which is (165:55 - 165:59)
what they did and then 15 was like (165:57 - 166:01)
here's an open world final fantasy game (165:59 - 166:04)
where the open world doesn't actually (166:01 - 166:06)
matter and you're better off just going (166:04 - 166:07)
from story beat to story beat because (166:06 - 166:09)
otherwise you're walking in a desert for (166:07 - 166:10)
20 hours there's nothing to do (166:09 - 166:13)
i like 15 a lot that game has problems (166:10 - 166:15)
one of them being its open world (166:13 - 166:16)
but then you look at other series like (166:15 - 166:18)
resident evil the first three resident (166:16 - 166:21)
evils are its own thing when resident (166:18 - 166:23)
evil 4 came out it dramatically changed (166:21 - 166:25)
how that game played and how that game (166:23 - 166:27)
felt and they kept that until seven and (166:25 - 166:28)
seven and nine are completely different (166:27 - 166:29)
rest in evil games but they're all (166:28 - 166:32)
resident evil games so i don't buy into (166:29 - 166:34)
this like well it's not a real pokemon (166:32 - 166:35)
game if it's not (166:34 - 166:38)
whatever they've been doing like they (166:35 - 166:40)
have tried plenty of new things over the (166:38 - 166:43)
years and they've always fallen back on (166:40 - 166:46)
eight gyms three starters (166:43 - 166:48)
go on your journey and that works and (166:46 - 166:50)
obviously it works very well they sold (166:48 - 166:52)
21 million copies of certain shield like (166:50 - 166:54)
there's not a part of me that thinks (166:52 - 166:56)
they're never going to get away from (166:54 - 166:57)
that completely but i'm glad they're (166:56 - 166:59)
trying something new yeah i mean they (166:57 - 167:01)
took a big risk with let's go and they (166:59 - 167:02)
put pokemon in the overworld and that (167:01 - 167:05)
paid off and it seems like they're (167:02 - 167:07)
they're staying with that good (167:05 - 167:08)
um (167:07 - 167:11)
so i'm excited even if arceus comes out (167:08 - 167:14)
and it's a flop and ign gives it a three (167:11 - 167:16)
out of ten and game informer gives it a (167:14 - 167:19)
two out of five or whatever they're like (167:16 - 167:21)
i am still glad they tried something new (167:19 - 167:23)
yes (167:21 - 167:25)
and worst case scenario if the bad game (167:23 - 167:27)
the music in that trailer (167:25 - 167:28)
very good (167:27 - 167:31)
they won't release that on a cd for you (167:28 - 167:33)
i'm sorry (167:31 - 167:35)
uh well pokemon of the week (167:33 - 167:39)
uh so last week's pokemon um it (167:35 - 167:40)
basically had (167:39 - 167:42)
two clues (167:40 - 167:45)
although i think there's one (167:42 - 167:46)
something about things being quickly and (167:45 - 167:48)
easily forgotten (167:46 - 167:51)
first part of its name uh (167:48 - 167:54)
kind of similar to a name that people (167:51 - 167:57)
applied to another pokemon from the same (167:54 - 168:02)
region release of regional decks (167:57 - 168:05)
the second part of its name is from one (168:02 - 168:07)
of its physical features which is also a (168:05 - 168:09)
physical feature of (168:07 - 168:10)
aquatic animals (168:09 - 168:12)
technically (168:10 - 168:14)
that's the term for it (168:12 - 168:15)
um (168:14 - 168:18)
but there's only one other in that (168:15 - 168:19)
region there's only one pokemon (168:18 - 168:22)
evolutionary line that would also have (168:19 - 168:25)
that feature (168:22 - 168:28)
wasn't that hard (168:25 - 168:28)
it's (168:29 - 168:32)
munchlax (168:31 - 168:34)

a sinnoh celebration except not (170:36 - 170:42)
two weeks ago we featured a so-called (170:39 - 170:44)
middle evolution that received a new (170:42 - 170:46)
final evolution in the diamond and pearl (170:44 - 170:49)
games even though it already had an (170:46 - 170:52)
existing subsequent evolution (170:49 - 170:54)
it turns out that there are several (170:52 - 170:56)
pokemon that received an additional (170:54 - 170:58)
evolution in diamond and pearl that they (170:56 - 171:00)
did not have this week's pokemon is one (170:58 - 171:02)
of those i hope i got that right (171:00 - 171:05)
i'd be wrong i don't know (171:02 - 171:07)
beginning with where they appear in the (171:05 - 171:09)
national pokedex we have new evolutions (171:07 - 171:10)
that are (171:09 - 171:14)
dark ice electric steel normal ground (171:10 - 171:18)

ground normal psychic fighting rock (171:22 - 171:29)
steel ghost and ice ghost (171:25 - 171:31)
this week's pokemon does not evolve (171:29 - 171:33)
while knowing a particular move it does (171:31 - 171:35)
not evolve while being exposed to a (171:33 - 171:37)
particular held item (171:35 - 171:40)
no special location required it does not (171:37 - 171:42)
it doesn't have to level up holding a (171:40 - 171:45)
particular item at night (171:42 - 171:48)
there is one other form of evolution (171:45 - 171:50)
that remains and that is how this week's (171:48 - 171:52)
pokemon evolves (171:50 - 171:54)
you need a friend and you need something (171:52 - 171:55)
imbued with horrifyingly strong (171:54 - 171:58)
spiritual (171:55 - 171:58)
energy i mean that's a lot of words but (171:59 - 172:04)
