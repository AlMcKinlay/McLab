disappointment (0:57 - 1:02)
my team team mello yellow did (0:58 - 1:05)
very poorly in the 2020 marble league (1:02 - 1:07)
it was a good league it was a very (1:05 - 1:09)
exciting year (1:07 - 1:11)
but i am very disappointed with mellow (1:09 - 1:13)
yellow showings (1:11 - 1:15)
yellow team always loses they don't (1:13 - 1:17)
always lose (1:15 - 1:20)
well fall guys would say differently oh (1:17 - 1:21)
well you and your (1:20 - 1:23)
fall guys and your marbles this is a (1:21 - 1:24)
pokemon podcast (1:23 - 1:28)
and now i'm going to say what i got i (1:24 - 1:31)
yesterday purchased this fantastic (1:28 - 1:34)
game called pokemon shield and i started (1:31 - 1:35)
playing it (1:34 - 1:37)
why didn't you guys tell me that pokemon (1:35 - 1:39)
shield is better than (1:37 - 1:41)
i pokemon sword you've been holding out (1:39 - 1:43)
on me for this entire time like what has (1:41 - 1:44)
this been like eleven (1:43 - 1:48)
eight nine months okay look (1:44 - 1:51)
we told you that that was a better game (1:48 - 1:52)
a long time ago but (1:51 - 1:54)
also we didn't tell you at the beginning (1:52 - 1:55)
because we wanted you to play the bad (1:54 - 1:58)
game and transfer pokemon over to us (1:55 - 1:58)
[Laughter] (1:58 - 2:01)
[Music] (1:58 - 2:03)
so i have to suffer for your benefit (2:01 - 2:04)
yeah (2:03 - 2:07)
like you like suffering as it is we are (2:04 - 2:08)
just giving you what you want i mean (2:07 - 2:10)
that's why people listen to the show (2:08 - 2:12)
because they like to hear me suffer yes (2:10 - 2:13)
i (2:12 - 2:18)
object strike strike strike strike as i (2:13 - 2:19)
heard from greg (2:18 - 2:23)
this is a lesson i've learned what (2:19 - 2:26)
have a show for you all (2:23 - 2:31)
we have um some lots of vgc stuff some (2:26 - 2:32)
pokemon (2:31 - 2:34)
video game championship stuff there was (2:32 - 2:35)
the (2:34 - 2:37)
it is the time it is the one year (2:35 - 2:40)
anniversary for pokemon masters (2:37 - 2:42)
and i guess we could probably spend two (2:40 - 2:44)
hours on all the makeup day events (2:42 - 2:47)
for pokemon go but we'll give you the (2:44 - 2:49)
quick summary (2:47 - 2:51)
as well but let's start off with none of (2:49 - 2:52)
that news (2:51 - 2:54)
[Music] (2:52 - 2:57)
getting right into it and there is a (2:54 - 2:58)
gallerian (2:57 - 3:00)
sir fetched doesn't really make sense (2:58 - 3:01)
because sir fetch is only (3:00 - 3:06)
surface vbox in the uh pokemon tcg (3:01 - 3:08)
that will come out on september 25th (3:06 - 3:10)
that's the news (3:08 - 3:12)
the four booster packs one oversized (3:10 - 3:14)
gallerian surf hv (3:12 - 3:17)
one promo card how many packs of primal (3:14 - 3:18)
clash am i getting you know i'm not (3:17 - 3:21)
seeing any primal clash here i see (3:18 - 3:25)
uh i see some xy evolutions (3:21 - 3:25)
may as well have been primal clash i see (3:26 - 3:33)
uh bass sword and shield think i'm (3:30 - 3:35)
seeing two darkness ablaze so not the (3:33 - 3:36)
worst (3:35 - 3:38)
xy evolutions does have about 18 (3:36 - 3:41)
different charizards in it (3:38 - 3:43)
well charizard's the best which is why (3:41 - 3:45)
it's winning second in the (3:43 - 3:49)
poll right now i i think i'd have to (3:45 - 3:50)
check i don't have it in front of me but (3:49 - 3:51)
i'm gonna save this off the top of my (3:50 - 3:53)
head so take it with a grain of salt i'm (3:51 - 3:53)
pretty sure (3:53 - 3:57)
xy evolutions was the best-selling tcg (3:53 - 3:59)
set of all time (3:57 - 4:03)
which came after x and y but before the (3:59 - 4:05)
sun and moon set but also (4:03 - 4:07)
at the same time pokemon go pokemon go (4:05 - 4:09)
dropped (4:07 - 4:12)
so it's kind of no surprise if they re (4:09 - 4:16)
print the base set during the time where (4:12 - 4:18)
people got back into pokemon marketing (4:16 - 4:20)
101 i guess (4:18 - 4:23)
but uh a rising pokemon lifts all (4:20 - 4:26)
pokemon uh but i you know they still got (4:23 - 4:26)
a (4:26 - 4:28)
you know a couple packs lying around (4:26 - 4:30)
they're just thrown into this booster (4:28 - 4:32)
box starting in that box (4:30 - 4:34)
well they're not gonna sell themselves (4:32 - 4:36)
well hey you know what (4:34 - 4:38)
i just had a realization the one good (4:36 - 4:40)
thing about them not having pokemon (4:38 - 4:42)
worlds this year is we don't have to (4:40 - 4:43)
listen to steve complain that he got the (4:42 - 4:45)
crummy tcg (4:43 - 4:48)
when everybody else got the good one (4:45 - 4:48)
crimson invasion well i wouldn't have (4:49 - 4:54)
complained if it was xy evolutions (4:51 - 4:57)
xy evolutions at least has a chance of (4:54 - 4:59)
charging (4:57 - 4:59)
i will not confirm or deny that we have (5:01 - 5:04)
spoken to the pokemon company about (5:02 - 5:06)
making sure you get poor packs because (5:04 - 5:07)
they send you (5:06 - 5:09)
a ton of gifts what do we get steve they (5:07 - 5:10)
don't necessarily (5:09 - 5:12)
when's the last time they sent me (5:10 - 5:13)
something they sent you an advent (5:12 - 5:14)
calendar (5:13 - 5:18)
yeah i didn't get an admin oh yeah they (5:14 - 5:18)
did send me an (5:18 - 5:21)
account oh yeah they did uh just refer (5:18 - 5:22)
to uh (5:21 - 5:25)
articles 6.7 paragraph three (5:22 - 5:27)
in uh my legal complaint about things (5:25 - 5:29)
that steve gets that will doesn't get (5:27 - 5:32)
yeah hey i offered you a free ticket (5:29 - 5:34)
provided by the pokemon company (5:32 - 5:37)
to the power of us yeah and i took it (5:34 - 5:37)
and (5:37 - 5:40)
i took it instead of recording a podcast (5:37 - 5:41)
with will (5:40 - 5:44)
and i still regret that choice i i (5:41 - 5:47)
i don't recall any of that i got you (5:44 - 5:49)
you i heard that you purchased pokemon (5:47 - 5:52)
shield will i have uh money (5:49 - 5:56)
i have an extra copy of the pokemon (5:52 - 5:58)

hey now we're talking since i already (6:00 - 6:04)
paid (6:02 - 6:08)
for sword (6:04 - 6:10)
i would appreciate that would be very (6:08 - 6:11)
helpful so i can have (6:10 - 6:14)
a living pokedex that has both a kubfu (6:11 - 6:17)
and an urshifu see there you go i'm (6:14 - 6:18)
always i'm always looking out for my (6:17 - 6:19)
podcast and boys (6:18 - 6:23)
no you're not section 7.6 (6:19 - 6:26)
paragraph 4 how you're not always (6:23 - 6:28)
looking out for your pokemon (6:26 - 6:31)
non-gender-specific co-hosts what if i (6:28 - 6:32)
told you there was a (6:31 - 6:36)
free battle ready porygon 2 for people (6:32 - 6:37)
who are (6:36 - 6:40)
on the podcast this for everybody it's (6:37 - 6:42)
on the website i'm looking at it right (6:40 - 6:43)
now it's a code (6:42 - 6:45)
oh well i mean that doesn't mean it's (6:43 - 6:48)
also not for you (6:45 - 6:50)
i already got it so as we're recording (6:48 - 6:53)
this it is the pokemon players cup this (6:50 - 6:54)
weekend (6:53 - 6:56)
at one po at one point they they showed (6:54 - 6:58)
the code on screen (6:56 - 7:00)
and it was nothing but twitch chat doing (6:58 - 7:02)
exclamation point code in the chat (7:00 - 7:04)
over and over before the broadcast even (7:02 - 7:05)
started trying to figure out what the (7:04 - 7:06)
code was (7:05 - 7:09)
and then they showed it and then twitch (7:06 - 7:10)
cat (7:09 - 7:13)
twitch chat calmed down but uh this is a (7:10 - 7:16)
battle ready porygon (7:13 - 7:18)
uh i posted the code on our twitter (7:16 - 7:20)
instagram all that stuff in the slack in (7:18 - 7:21)
the discord (7:20 - 7:23)
and then quickly learned how many people (7:21 - 7:25)
don't read the slack in the discord as (7:23 - 7:28)
they continued to post the code (7:25 - 7:29)
even though it was in the announcements (7:28 - 7:31)
channel but that's okay you live and (7:29 - 7:34)
learn you try to help out (7:31 - 7:34)
yeah am i am i not subscribed to the (7:34 - 7:37)
announcements channel what you have to (7:36 - 7:38)
be you can't (7:37 - 7:40)
unsubscribe from it i could do lots of (7:38 - 7:43)
things (7:40 - 7:43)
porygon is good until august 31st (7:43 - 7:49)
so plenty of time i don't like that that (7:46 - 7:51)
they said battle ready (7:49 - 7:55)
here because they locked the speed iv to (7:51 - 7:56)
be zero (7:55 - 7:58)
and the attack iv to be zero which is (7:56 - 8:00)
good but then the other (7:58 - 8:02)
ivs are not good the other ivs are (8:00 - 8:03)
randomized so you have to bottle cap (8:02 - 8:04)
those (8:03 - 8:05)
you don't want to bottle cap the speed (8:04 - 8:08)
because porygon has been for trick room (8:05 - 8:10)
um so they did lock those they did ev (8:08 - 8:12)
train it it does have a proper moveset (8:10 - 8:15)
and item it's just weird that they like (8:12 - 8:18)
didn't just give it perfect ivs in the (8:15 - 8:20)
spots where you would perfect iv yet (8:18 - 8:22)
and you could be like well bottle cap it (8:20 - 8:24)
which yeah totally (8:22 - 8:26)
but it's level 50 so you have to get it (8:24 - 8:28)
to 100 then bottle cap it (8:26 - 8:29)
and i think the only reason that's like (8:28 - 8:31)
a minor complaint is because (8:29 - 8:34)
several hours a couple hours before (8:31 - 8:36)
porygon they released a gastrodon (8:34 - 8:39)
and it was perfect ivs and bottle caps (8:36 - 8:40)
and like it was (8:39 - 8:44)
actually ready to go um so i'm not sure (8:40 - 8:47)
was this like somebody's porygon or (8:44 - 8:50)
this is not somebody's porygon uh the ot (8:47 - 8:55)
will be vgc20 and it will come with a (8:50 - 8:57)
ribbon and it will come in a cherish (8:55 - 8:58)
ball (8:57 - 9:02)
the gastrodon was a korean players (8:58 - 9:03)
gastrodon (9:02 - 9:06)
which is ended that was only like a 36 (9:03 - 9:07)
hour (9:06 - 9:10)
distribution like the amungus (9:07 - 9:12)
not shiny but cherish ball butt ribbon (9:10 - 9:14)
perfect ivs (9:12 - 9:17)
perfect zero speed good (9:14 - 9:21)
uh move set cherish ball (9:17 - 9:23)
that one is done i wanted that one if (9:21 - 9:24)
you missed it you missed it (9:23 - 9:28)
oh i missed it i didn't post it in (9:24 - 9:30)
announcements (9:28 - 9:30)
i'm opening slack now because i'm pretty (9:31 - 9:35)
sure i am not in announcements or i have (9:33 - 9:37)
it like on super mute (9:35 - 9:39)
you could you could mute announcements i (9:37 - 9:40)
guess (9:39 - 9:43)
you could take this the kind step to (9:40 - 9:45)
text (9:43 - 9:48)
i know and honestly the things that he (9:45 - 9:48)
does (9:48 - 9:51)
text us (9:48 - 9:51)

feel like i did text you about the (9:56 - 9:59)
mungus (9:57 - 10:02)
which was not necessary since i whatever (9:59 - 10:06)
i listen (10:02 - 10:06)
i just i there are times when i just (10:06 - 10:10)
don't (10:09 - 10:13)
understand you (10:10 - 10:13)
look i i i post it on twitter (10:13 - 10:18)
in the discord on the slack in the (10:16 - 10:20)
instagram (10:18 - 10:22)
now you're asking for personal text (10:20 - 10:23)
messages (10:22 - 10:26)
no i want shared text messages with (10:23 - 10:28)
me and greg that yeah nothing personal (10:26 - 10:29)
about it (10:28 - 10:31)

actual rates right now (10:51 - 10:55)
hey get my wife a job and i'll be in (10:56 - 11:00)
minnesota (10:58 - 11:00)
this is not from lack of effort i heard (11:03 - 11:08)
she applied for a new job last night (11:06 - 11:10)
awesome it's a real awkward time to (11:08 - 11:14)
apply for a job (11:10 - 11:14)
probably the best time to move though to (11:15 - 11:19)
be fair it is (11:17 - 11:21)
i mean you could just move you know i (11:19 - 11:24)
thought about it (11:21 - 11:24)
[Music] (11:24 - 11:29)
i definitely just thought about it uh (11:27 - 11:31)
pokemon masters (11:29 - 11:35)
uh there's a lot here in pokemon masters (11:31 - 11:38)
yeah they're uh fire up the gardenscapes (11:35 - 11:40)
i'm gonna (11:38 - 11:42)
i'm pulling this off pokemon.com they (11:40 - 11:44)
put out like a 10 minute video (11:42 - 11:47)
i don't know if will or greg saw it i (11:44 - 11:48)
watched it why (11:47 - 11:51)
why why would i do that (11:48 - 11:53)
well what because i didn't text it to (11:51 - 11:56)
you because you got to adapt (11:53 - 11:59)
maybe if you saw the video well you (11:56 - 12:00)
would have been like i want to play (11:59 - 12:01)
pokemon masters now (12:00 - 12:04)
maybe if i was uh not with this update (12:01 - 12:04)
partner with (12:04 - 12:08)
dina i'd put forth the effort (12:04 - 12:10)
but dina did not reach out to me what if (12:08 - 12:11)
well (12:10 - 12:12)
look do you get you want to sign some (12:11 - 12:14)
paperwork dna i'm sure i can move you (12:12 - 12:15)
right on in (12:14 - 12:18)
what if i told you will that you're no (12:15 - 12:21)
longer playing pokemon masters (12:18 - 12:24)
but instead you're playing pokemon (12:21 - 12:24)
masters (12:24 - 12:28)
ex i mean please waste your breath and (12:24 - 12:29)
tell me that (12:28 - 12:33)
because i am unmoved but the name change (12:29 - 12:35)
is to reflect the many new experiences (12:33 - 12:37)
the game has to offer since its release (12:35 - 12:38)
that's off pokemon (12:37 - 12:42)
have a match three component nope yeah (12:38 - 12:42)
i'm out (12:42 - 12:45)
what about a six sta a star ex (12:42 - 12:48)
sink pair i hear the disgruntledness in (12:45 - 12:50)
your voice greg (12:48 - 12:52)
as this is a podcast i cannot see your (12:50 - 12:53)
face i'm sure it is (12:52 - 12:56)
there's a friend it is sour and frowny (12:53 - 12:58)
emoji emoji frown frown frown (12:56 - 13:02)
let's put uh emotions aside here is this (12:58 - 13:06)
a thing that other gotcha games do (13:02 - 13:09)
they go from five to six is this common (13:06 - 13:12)
i have never seen this (13:09 - 13:12)
i wasn't expecting that answer i don't (13:12 - 13:16)
even understand what that means they go (13:14 - 13:18)
from five to six what are they supposed (13:16 - 13:19)
to do go from five to ten (13:18 - 13:22)
well i think five is the rarest yes and (13:19 - 13:24)
now they're saying that you can take (13:22 - 13:27)
now they're gonna go to a six star ex (13:24 - 13:29)
which is this (13:27 - 13:32)
it's so dumb (13:29 - 13:32)
okay with the addition of six star ex (13:33 - 13:36)
inc pairs (13:36 - 13:39)
your str your strength and potential (13:36 - 13:40)
will increase (13:39 - 13:43)
okay obviously uh after you train a five (13:40 - 13:45)
star sink pair and meet certain (13:43 - 13:46)
conditions you will be able to raise (13:45 - 13:49)
async pairs potential the six star (13:46 - 13:51)
elevating the power even more as a bonus (13:49 - 13:53)
six star sink pairs will also get to (13:51 - 13:56)
wear different color outfits (13:53 - 13:57)
only a few sink pairs will be raised to (13:56 - 14:00)
level six any new sync pair (13:57 - 14:02)
added to the game over time will become (14:00 - 14:03)
six star ex (14:02 - 14:06)
and overtime all existing sync pairs (14:03 - 14:08)
will have the capability (14:06 - 14:11)
one of the first sink pairs you will be (14:08 - 14:12)
able to raise the six star (14:11 - 14:16)
is red and charizard okay (14:12 - 14:19)
there's other changes but the outfit (14:16 - 14:20)
thing is cool (14:19 - 14:23)
i i like outfits uh i'm a bit (14:20 - 14:26)
bummed that our own character still has (14:23 - 14:27)
the same outfit (14:26 - 14:30)
yep saw or i saw somebody point out that (14:27 - 14:30)
the (14:30 - 14:34)
in the trailer they only had one red (14:30 - 14:37)
one out of five reds and it was six star (14:34 - 14:40)
which i think you need three out of five (14:37 - 14:40)
for (14:40 - 14:44)
um what's that called grid (14:40 - 14:48)
yeah so that's good i think (14:44 - 14:50)
um but we don't know anything really (14:48 - 14:52)
else about this unless (14:50 - 14:55)
i'm missing something greg no i so (14:52 - 14:57)
this is purely a function of the fact (14:55 - 14:58)
that they (14:57 - 15:01)
start at three this is in essence saying (14:58 - 15:03)
we're adding a fourth star (15:01 - 15:05)
we just call it six stars the (15:03 - 15:06)
frustrating thing (15:05 - 15:08)
that they're doing is they still haven't (15:06 - 15:10)
really sync grids for every character (15:08 - 15:14)
they are going to release things (15:10 - 15:16)
going forward that will have the six (15:14 - 15:18)
star (15:16 - 15:20)
of and eventually get back to everybody (15:18 - 15:22)
else and the main thing that this does (15:20 - 15:25)
is makes all getting all of the old sync (15:22 - 15:26)
pairs that you (15:25 - 15:28)
already don't enjoy getting from your (15:26 - 15:30)
polls even worse (15:28 - 15:32)
because they're all so many of them are (15:30 - 15:33)
already stuck (15:32 - 15:36)
and you can't use them at all (15:33 - 15:38)
and you you are now we're now in a thing (15:36 - 15:40)
where we're getting so few gems again (15:38 - 15:43)
we're getting like everything's cut back (15:40 - 15:44)
oh speaking (15:43 - 15:47)
of back did they always do the 80 gems a (15:44 - 15:47)
day (15:47 - 15:49)
for doing your life no that's that the (15:47 - 15:51)
80 times a day is a new is a new thing (15:49 - 15:52)
from (15:51 - 15:54)
for a dailies i forget what it used to (15:52 - 15:55)
be you still was when they got rid of (15:54 - 15:56)
bingo right (15:55 - 15:58)
yeah well they saw bingo no it's when (15:56 - 16:00)
they got rid of because you used to have (15:58 - 16:01)
daily (16:00 - 16:02)
used to get a daily voucher to increase (16:01 - 16:04)
your pair and now you get (16:02 - 16:08)
the 80 gems instead i think that's (16:04 - 16:09)
better (16:08 - 16:11)
it's a little bit better it's still not (16:09 - 16:13)
enough announcing that you're doing six (16:11 - 16:14)
stars and of course you're picking (16:13 - 16:16)
charizard it's like so (16:14 - 16:19)
the ones that are already overpowered (16:16 - 16:19)
are (16:19 - 16:23)
only going to get worse and they have (16:19 - 16:26)
no real reason to go back (16:23 - 16:28)
and fix things even though they say they (16:26 - 16:30)
will they've been saying they're going (16:28 - 16:31)
to really sink grids for everybody (16:30 - 16:34)
and we are nowhere near that like (16:31 - 16:35)
nowhere near (16:34 - 16:38)
having full secrets for older characters (16:35 - 16:40)
and so by the time they implement this (16:38 - 16:44)
that gap will be so wide then it just (16:40 - 16:46)
makes getting those older ones (16:44 - 16:49)
so much worse do you think the secret (16:46 - 16:50)
problem is (16:49 - 16:54)
because it's complicated yes (16:50 - 16:56)
because i mean in a word the secret (16:54 - 16:57)
thing is really (16:56 - 16:59)
is really complicated the first time i (16:57 - 17:01)
went to do synchron (16:59 - 17:04)
i was like it's it's very intimidating (17:01 - 17:05)
yes (17:04 - 17:08)
there's no instruction no uh you can (17:05 - 17:09)
redo it which i don't think they make (17:08 - 17:10)
clear (17:09 - 17:13)
but then the worry is if i put the stuff (17:10 - 17:14)
in it and then it's wrong (17:13 - 17:17)
am i stuck with this but you you can (17:14 - 17:19)
like clear it out and get your (17:17 - 17:22)
orbs back or whatever yeah the thing is (17:19 - 17:24)
is like it doesn't really (17:22 - 17:26)
it doesn't explain what the different (17:24 - 17:27)
paths do like (17:26 - 17:30)
the game is not unless you are a stat (17:27 - 17:33)
wonk the game isn't great at explaining (17:30 - 17:35)
to you how this changes things (17:33 - 17:37)
like if i go down this path what am i (17:35 - 17:39)
getting i still don't know what speed (17:37 - 17:43)
that's in the game it's it's really (17:39 - 17:46)
a juice i use like the samurai and it's (17:43 - 17:47)
like (17:46 - 17:49)
increased speed and i'm like okay but i (17:47 - 17:50)
don't feel like i'm fast (17:49 - 17:53)
here what is it oh i was gonna say it (17:50 - 17:54)
can attack (17:53 - 17:56)
first but i guess not it's real time (17:54 - 17:57)
yeah (17:56 - 18:00)
yeah it's (17:57 - 18:00)
what i understand for speed is it (18:01 - 18:04)
increases (18:03 - 18:07)
how quickly the move gauge refills (18:04 - 18:09)
but i think the first two or three (18:07 - 18:11)
levels it's so (18:09 - 18:14)
not noticeable that intellect is pretty (18:11 - 18:16)
high then you'll see it fill up really (18:14 - 18:18)
quick but (18:16 - 18:18)
yeah i i i i i mean the only reason (18:19 - 18:24)
i slightly know synchronous is because (18:22 - 18:26)
my twitch chat was like (18:24 - 18:29)
the max amount of or sink orbs you put (18:26 - 18:31)
into a grid is 750 (18:29 - 18:33)
and they're like you can't go above you (18:31 - 18:35)
can go above 750 but you can't spend (18:33 - 18:37)
more than 750 (18:35 - 18:41)
and nowhere does the game tell you that (18:37 - 18:45)
right and like so i put 750 into skyla (18:41 - 18:47)
because they're like because my twitch (18:45 - 18:50)
chat was like oh skyla is awesome (18:47 - 18:52)
um and i think the pokemon masters (18:50 - 18:54)
subreddit also loves skyla (18:52 - 18:57)
skyla a three star sync pair so i i (18:54 - 18:59)
i did two things and i i'm going to (18:57 - 19:02)
blame my twitch chat but number one is i (18:59 - 19:05)
put 750 sync orbs into skyla (19:02 - 19:09)
to then realize that i can't even spend (19:05 - 19:11)
all 750 because i don't (19:09 - 19:13)
have skyla alway already leveled up (19:11 - 19:15)
because skyla (19:13 - 19:17)
was a limited time event and she's not (19:15 - 19:19)
there anymore (19:17 - 19:22)
i know that now and i've i've lived with (19:19 - 19:22)
that (19:22 - 19:24)
mistake and that's fine like it's not (19:22 - 19:27)
like those sync orbs have gone to (19:24 - 19:28)
you could maybe argue they've gone to (19:27 - 19:30)
waste but they're they're still sitting (19:28 - 19:32)
there so when skyla does come back i can (19:30 - 19:32)
then (19:32 - 19:34)
use the rest of them but if i was (19:32 - 19:36)
limited on sync orbs (19:34 - 19:37)
i could have used that for another (19:36 - 19:39)
character but (19:37 - 19:41)
if you're just like a basic if you if (19:39 - 19:42)
you love if you like masters and you're (19:41 - 19:44)
not visiting the subreddit and you're (19:42 - 19:44)
not (19:44 - 19:47)
listening to podcasts and you're not (19:44 - 19:48)
watching i don't know masters youtube (19:47 - 19:49)
videos (19:48 - 19:52)
you you have no clue and the thing is is (19:49 - 19:54)
like try out builds but they (19:52 - 19:57)
they're very obtuse they're very they (19:54 - 19:58)
aren't (19:57 - 20:01)
clear as to what ones like if i go down (19:58 - 20:02)
this path (20:01 - 20:03)
is it the stuff that's touching it (20:02 - 20:05)
unlocks like because there's stuff (20:03 - 20:07)
that's locked and you're like well (20:05 - 20:08)
does that unlock by me leveling up does (20:07 - 20:11)
that unlock by me spending my secret (20:08 - 20:12)
like the game is (20:11 - 20:14)
terrible explaining how this really (20:12 - 20:15)
complicated system (20:14 - 20:18)
is as a result i have not really done (20:15 - 20:19)
anything with sync (20:18 - 20:22)
orbs because it's hard to (20:19 - 20:26)
invest in a sync grid when they are (20:22 - 20:29)
especially now announcing oh hey we're (20:26 - 20:31)
going to have super powered (20:29 - 20:33)
pairs coming out it's like okay well i (20:31 - 20:35)
don't want to spend anything on (20:33 - 20:38)
these old ones because i don't know when (20:35 - 20:40)
skyla is ever going to get a six star (20:38 - 20:43)
ex i will wait for the better one that (20:40 - 20:45)
will be a six star ex and then i'll (20:43 - 20:47)
spend all my sync orbs on that (20:45 - 20:50)
and everything below it is worthless and (20:47 - 20:52)
the game is not (20:50 - 20:56)
kind enough to how players want to play (20:52 - 20:58)
that you can use any pokemon that any (20:56 - 21:00)
pair that you like (20:58 - 21:02)
in there and expect to be able to get to (21:00 - 21:04)
the upper limits you just can't (21:02 - 21:06)
yeah my the reason i brought up the sync (21:04 - 21:07)
gird stuff is because (21:06 - 21:10)
my only maybe thought and i don't know i (21:07 - 21:11)
don't this is (21:10 - 21:13)
i like i don't have any inside scoop at (21:11 - 21:15)
dna i i just think that like (21:13 - 21:18)
because synchroids don't seem very (21:15 - 21:20)
user-friendly (21:18 - 21:22)
that maybe the reason they didn't roll (21:20 - 21:23)
it out to everyone is because they're (21:22 - 21:24)
reworking it (21:23 - 21:26)
which would probably be good because i (21:24 - 21:28)
don't think (21:26 - 21:30)
what we have now for sync grids is like (21:28 - 21:31)
the best (21:30 - 21:34)
thing to interact with yeah does (21:31 - 21:37)
red and charizard have syncred yeah oh (21:34 - 21:38)
yes (21:37 - 21:40)
yeah they have a full sink red oh i only (21:38 - 21:42)
think i have one (21:40 - 21:43)
red and charizard so i don't think i can (21:42 - 21:45)
see it yeah it's (21:43 - 21:48)
just okay so the other rest of the game (21:45 - 21:51)
before you add six stars fix the rest (21:48 - 21:52)
so another thing they're adding to the (21:51 - 21:55)
game uh which is part of me this will (21:52 - 21:56)
draw me in (21:55 - 21:59)
here this is i think this is cool a big (21:56 - 22:01)
update on august 27th is the champion (21:59 - 22:02)
stadium (22:01 - 22:05)
kanto challenge in the champions stadium (22:02 - 22:06)
you choose 15 (22:05 - 22:10)
sing pairs to take part on in five three (22:06 - 22:11)
on three battles (22:10 - 22:13)
once a sing pair is battled it cannot (22:11 - 22:16)
take part in any remaining battles (22:13 - 22:17)
the cancer challenge has you facing off (22:16 - 22:19)
against the elite four in the kanto (22:17 - 22:20)
league (22:19 - 22:22)
champion blue before you take on blue (22:20 - 22:23)
you must (22:22 - 22:25)
challenge the elite four in any order (22:23 - 22:27)
you wish so put some thought into how (22:25 - 22:29)
to assemble your sink pair for this (22:27 - 22:31)
gauntlet there are two (22:29 - 22:33)
difficulty levels normal is standard and (22:31 - 22:35)
hard will give an expert trainer (22:33 - 22:37)
extra challenge playing through the (22:35 - 22:38)
champion stadium will earn you (22:37 - 22:42)
items to raise your sink pairs to 6 star (22:38 - 22:43)
ex (22:42 - 22:44)
even if you're playing normal you do not (22:43 - 22:47)
miss out on rewards each week (22:44 - 22:49)
you will have an opportunity to play (22:47 - 22:51)
through the champions stadium in order (22:49 - 22:53)
to earn items just be aware that if (22:51 - 22:54)
you're playing on hard (22:53 - 22:56)
your opponent's pokemon and type (22:54 - 22:57)
weakness will (22:56 - 23:00)
change each week so you will have to (22:57 - 23:02)
consistently update and adapt your (23:00 - 23:03)
strategy (23:02 - 23:05)
this seems cool to me because i feel (23:03 - 23:08)
like you don't have a lot of incentive (23:05 - 23:12)
not to use skyla because she's so good (23:08 - 23:15)
so you're kind of forced into skyla has (23:12 - 23:17)
to be on one specific team (23:15 - 23:20)
and it gives you an incentive to level (23:17 - 23:22)
up other sink pairs and try to put them (23:20 - 23:22)
together (23:22 - 23:24)
and i do like that hard will be (23:22 - 23:25)
different every single week so that's (23:24 - 23:26)
cool (23:25 - 23:29)
it has the potential to be cool there's (23:26 - 23:30)
a couple of things that (23:29 - 23:33)
that make me go so one (23:30 - 23:36)
is there's obviously going to be a very (23:33 - 23:39)
set pattern to just get through (23:36 - 23:42)
the kanto league right like these are (23:39 - 23:43)
the think pairs that you're gonna need (23:42 - 23:44)
to have (23:43 - 23:47)
especially on the normal difficulty uh (23:44 - 23:47)
i'm (23:47 - 23:49)
concerned about the stamina cost of (23:47 - 23:51)
doing this because stamina is already (23:49 - 23:53)
quickly becoming a problem (23:51 - 23:57)
we can't spend any of this episode right (23:53 - 24:00)
it's just a problem it is a problem i (23:57 - 24:01)
will i will say (24:00 - 24:05)
that the team that i work with at dna (24:01 - 24:07)
which is the american team which does (24:05 - 24:09)
not make the decisions the japanese team (24:07 - 24:11)
does that's why there was two japanese (24:09 - 24:11)
guys (24:11 - 24:14)
in the video um they're they're very (24:11 - 24:15)
well aware (24:14 - 24:18)
type weaknesses changing each week is a (24:15 - 24:21)
nice thing for people who (24:18 - 24:23)
are struggling to find things to do it (24:21 - 24:25)
is definitely (24:23 - 24:27)
a money sink at that point because you (24:25 - 24:29)
are going to have to try to (24:27 - 24:32)
invest in 15 good sync pairs and hope (24:29 - 24:34)
that you have them (24:32 - 24:37)
and that is not a given especially for (24:34 - 24:39)
a lot of the really good ones are (24:37 - 24:40)
limited offer ones (24:39 - 24:44)
so you know i've pulled one sigma suit (24:40 - 24:47)
cynthia i will probably not pull another (24:44 - 24:51)
ever and i have no way of raising (24:47 - 24:54)
that right and so i think that's a (24:51 - 24:55)
problem that (24:54 - 24:58)
is happening in this game that a lot of (24:55 - 25:00)
these one-time things have gone away and (24:58 - 25:00)
they're not (25:00 - 25:03)
coming back anytime soon that we can see (25:00 - 25:05)
and so there's just a lot (25:03 - 25:08)
of there's a lot of spending resources (25:05 - 25:09)
in the game that (25:08 - 25:11)
it leads to a feeling of i don't feel (25:09 - 25:13)
great spending this because (25:11 - 25:16)
since i didn't get a max skyla i'm (25:13 - 25:17)
picking something (25:16 - 25:19)
lesser so that i can get through the (25:17 - 25:21)
game but the minute i can get skyla i'm (25:19 - 25:22)
switching (25:21 - 25:25)
right and that's not a great feeling in (25:22 - 25:26)
your game (25:25 - 25:28)
like there's you don't have such an (25:26 - 25:30)
abundance of resources (25:28 - 25:33)
that you feel like well it's okay that i (25:30 - 25:36)
leveled will up to max and did a whole (25:33 - 25:36)
sync grid (25:36 - 25:38)
because i have plenty for when i finally (25:36 - 25:40)
get (25:38 - 25:42)
enough for skyla yeah he's right now (25:40 - 25:43)
it's (25:42 - 25:46)
you know right now it's just like well i (25:43 - 25:47)
mean i guess (25:46 - 25:49)
i have no other choice it's kind of the (25:47 - 25:50)
same thing like you can get (25:49 - 25:53)
cyrus but you have to get all the good (25:50 - 25:56)
pulls to be able to level cyrus (25:53 - 25:59)
and if you don't get them cyrus is just (25:56 - 25:59)
stuck (25:59 - 26:01)
right because you could you can only use (25:59 - 26:03)
the palkia cans (26:01 - 26:06)
to level up pelcia and if you just don't (26:03 - 26:07)
get them (26:06 - 26:11)
then you're done like that pair is (26:07 - 26:13)
basically useless it's the zinnia (26:11 - 26:15)
problem it's all of the limited problems (26:13 - 26:17)
where you feel like (26:15 - 26:18)
here are the good ones that i want to (26:17 - 26:21)
use i don't get them so i either have to (26:18 - 26:22)
sink a lot of money into it (26:21 - 26:24)
and the money in this one is still (26:22 - 26:27)
really bad the deals are still (26:24 - 26:30)
very bad and there's still still a sense (26:27 - 26:31)
of (26:30 - 26:35)
i'm wasting my time on lower sync pairs (26:31 - 26:37)
and it would be interesting if the (26:35 - 26:38)
normal one (26:37 - 26:41)
also changed weaknesses so that people (26:38 - 26:41)
could (26:41 - 26:43)
not could raise a bunch of other ones (26:41 - 26:45)
that weren't top tier (26:43 - 26:46)
and you could play with your favorites (26:45 - 26:48)
but since it's expert difficulty you (26:46 - 26:51)
know that you can only use (26:48 - 26:54)
the top ones at the top of those charts (26:51 - 26:57)
and the six star makes this whole (26:54 - 27:00)
problem worse it's just a really weird (26:57 - 27:01)
decision (27:00 - 27:03)
it's just a really weird take that (27:01 - 27:05)
they're going on (27:03 - 27:07)
and they've become even stingier like as (27:05 - 27:09)
everybody feared they'd be gone back to (27:07 - 27:11)
being very stingy with the resources (27:09 - 27:15)
um and it it it creates a frustrating (27:11 - 27:17)
it creates a frustrating feedback loop (27:15 - 27:19)
of i want to play the game i like (27:17 - 27:20)
certain parts of this game (27:19 - 27:23)
but i'm forced to make really (27:20 - 27:26)
sub-optimal and poor decisions (27:23 - 27:29)
and it hurts because i don't know when (27:26 - 27:32)
i'm going to get these things again (27:29 - 27:34)
they fixed some of it with the sync orb (27:32 - 27:36)
grips and those things where you feel (27:34 - 27:37)
like you can get those resources (27:36 - 27:40)
but that's leading into the much larger (27:37 - 27:42)
we're not going to touch on that stamina (27:40 - 27:43)
problem feel like i'm (27:42 - 27:45)
missing a part of the announcement i (27:43 - 27:46)
also have the cynthia and (27:45 - 27:49)
como was there one other thing they (27:46 - 27:50)

the name change cynthia coma oh (27:50 - 27:55)
elite four they said there would be (27:53 - 27:58)
there would be more elite (27:55 - 28:00)
yeah they'll they'll be doing the other (27:58 - 28:02)
reasons i kind of hope whatever point (28:00 - 28:04)
they don't go in order it'd be nice what (28:02 - 28:06)
are they going to do for johto (28:04 - 28:10)
oh shoto is very recycled (28:06 - 28:10)
it would be nice if they just maybe like (28:11 - 28:14)
i don't know did the gen (28:13 - 28:17)
7 get that out of the way still fresh in (28:14 - 28:18)
people's memory (28:17 - 28:21)
maybe not go to the disappointing joto (28:18 - 28:21)
one (28:21 - 28:24)
off the bat which is literally the the (28:21 - 28:27)
same (28:24 - 28:27)

green (29:44 - 29:48)
i i don't i don't i don't know i feel (29:45 - 29:49)
like every time people are like oh it's (29:48 - 29:51)
a new sick pair coming it has to be blue (29:49 - 29:52)
and green it never (29:51 - 29:55)

still not in the game when are they (29:59 - 30:03)
going to put deanthe in the game i mean (30:02 - 30:05)
she is in the game (30:03 - 30:07)
on the loading screen yes she is she's (30:05 - 30:08)
not (30:07 - 30:11)
she's not in the game oh you know you (30:08 - 30:13)
they did show some stuff we missed (30:11 - 30:16)
they showed that there is a lily gladion (30:13 - 30:18)
and um lusamine event going to be coming (30:16 - 30:19)
oh (30:18 - 30:21)
which i have such an issue with this (30:19 - 30:22)
what that sounds (30:21 - 30:25)
fun to me yeah that's awesome like (30:22 - 30:27)
you're making me the bad guy greg (30:25 - 30:28)
because i'm like (30:27 - 30:30)
excited for all these and you're like (30:28 - 30:31)
nope no no (30:30 - 30:34)
no no this none of that no no no just (30:31 - 30:35)
because you enjoy something and greg (30:34 - 30:38)
does not does not mean it's good or bad (30:35 - 30:39)
it's just that you're different people (30:38 - 30:41)
with different things you would (30:39 - 30:44)
enjoy here's my only issue what is the (30:41 - 30:48)
problem with the lily eventually (30:44 - 30:51)
that whole plot line was how horrible of (30:48 - 30:52)
a mother she was (30:51 - 30:55)
and they're like forced these two kids (30:52 - 30:58)
to reconnect with their abusive mom (30:55 - 31:02)
no no no no no she see a psychiatrist (30:58 - 31:05)
in kanto they retconned it in ultrasound (31:02 - 31:06)
ultramoon (31:05 - 31:08)
she wasn't abusive at all except for (31:06 - 31:09)
that (31:08 - 31:12)
except for that time she entirely was (31:09 - 31:14)
like there are so many other families (31:12 - 31:14)
you could (31:14 - 31:17)
pick that's not like hey make these kids (31:14 - 31:19)
deal with their bad mom (31:17 - 31:21)
and if you get them real good they'll (31:19 - 31:23)
all be friends again (31:21 - 31:27)
no thank you me look let's (31:23 - 31:29)
let's give masters credit where credit (31:27 - 31:30)
is due (31:29 - 31:34)
the silver storyline very good (31:30 - 31:36)
yes and that is something that the main (31:34 - 31:38)
series games didn't really touch on (31:36 - 31:40)
but the silver storyline was good so (31:38 - 31:41)
maybe (31:40 - 31:43)
the lilly storyline will just maybe (31:41 - 31:45)
address that and try to flesh that out a (31:43 - 31:46)
little bit more (31:45 - 31:49)
uh the cyrus stuff not great (31:46 - 31:52)
uh i'm cynthia was like we're going to (31:49 - 31:53)
arrest you (31:52 - 31:55)
and send you to jail or you need to (31:53 - 31:59)
change and cyrus was like (31:55 - 32:01)
i'll never change i'll never change i (31:59 - 32:02)
still want to destroy this world but i (32:01 - 32:04)
guess i'll play along so i don't go to (32:02 - 32:05)
jail thanks (32:04 - 32:09)
yeah the cyrus one not not (32:05 - 32:12)
great not real weird (32:09 - 32:15)
good it's just like (32:12 - 32:17)
also it's just it's very hard for me (32:15 - 32:18)
when people (32:17 - 32:20)
if people play pokemon for the story i i (32:18 - 32:22)
know they're out there i i see you (32:20 - 32:28)
i get it but there are better stories (32:22 - 32:32)
and much other like pokemon stories are (32:28 - 32:35)
nowhere near top of like moving pulling (32:32 - 32:36)
on my heart strings or (32:35 - 32:41)
or or whatnot and cyrus's character (32:36 - 32:44)
is is pretty i think i think silver is (32:41 - 32:48)
easier to write as a character because (32:44 - 32:48)
they're like (32:48 - 32:51)
young and you can be like well you're (32:48 - 32:53)
that it's like every every adult can (32:51 - 32:55)
relate to this like when i was a kid i (32:53 - 32:56)
was an idiot (32:55 - 32:59)
right yep so it's uh sorry (32:56 - 33:02)
no i can't i can't relate to that at all (32:59 - 33:06)
i've always been perfect so it's easy to (33:02 - 33:07)
like write a character that's (33:06 - 33:10)
like stubborn and and and and (33:07 - 33:14)
maybe a thief and had dad issues (33:10 - 33:16)
oh well definitely a thief and had daddy (33:14 - 33:18)
issues like silver did (33:16 - 33:20)
whereas like when you're writing a grown (33:18 - 33:21)
man (33:20 - 33:25)
who's like i want to crush the world (33:21 - 33:27)
and every time he gets magically (33:25 - 33:28)
teleported whether it's like rainbow (33:27 - 33:31)
rocket or this he's like (33:28 - 33:34)
is this the new world i am on a beach (33:31 - 33:35)
this is (33:34 - 33:38)
this looks very different i think i (33:35 - 33:39)
think this is (33:38 - 33:42)
ever oh it is cynthia you are wearing a (33:39 - 33:44)
different outfit i will crush you (33:42 - 33:46)
and she's like i'm going to send you to (33:44 - 33:48)
jail and he's like (33:46 - 33:51)
i still want to crush but i will join (33:48 - 33:51)
your (33:51 - 33:54)
team to crush the elite four like (33:51 - 33:57)
it's like they just don't know how to (33:54 - 33:59)
write cyrus because he's an adult and it (33:57 - 34:02)
just seems very silly (33:59 - 34:06)
well his entire worldview is like (34:02 - 34:09)
liking people as a weakness destroy the (34:06 - 34:10)
world you're (34:09 - 34:12)
imperfect how dare you come near me (34:10 - 34:13)
child (34:12 - 34:17)
and sophocles is like i have a wrote tom (34:13 - 34:17)
he does at one point go i like this (34:18 - 34:23)
i like this rotom it reminds me of (34:21 - 34:24)
rotom's (34:23 - 34:27)
it's like that whole plot line and i'm (34:24 - 34:28)
like (34:27 - 34:29)
i mean it was kind of bad that you were (34:28 - 34:31)
letting a mob boss (34:29 - 34:34)
on your team this guy is straight up a (34:31 - 34:36)
psychopath (34:34 - 34:39)
he has stated multiple times to (34:36 - 34:41)
everybody on this beach (34:39 - 34:44)
that he wants to blow up the world (34:41 - 34:49)
and he hasn't said okay no (34:44 - 34:52)
it's it's it's unreal actually i feel (34:49 - 34:54)
like (34:52 - 34:54)
they i'm i i wonder if there's like some (34:55 - 34:59)
profile (34:58 - 35:00)
like all these characters have like (34:59 - 35:02)
profiles in the pokemon company and they (35:00 - 35:04)
like pulled out cyrus and they're like (35:02 - 35:06)
all right what do we got for cyrus (35:04 - 35:09)
well he's dedicated and making sure the (35:06 - 35:11)
world starts over (35:09 - 35:14)
uh really loves space and time (35:11 - 35:18)
and has no empathy for anything (35:14 - 35:21)
all right likes rotom who are you going (35:18 - 35:24)
to pair them with (35:21 - 35:24)
sophocles hasn't done anything at all (35:24 - 35:30)
they're the same right they make things (35:27 - 35:34)
sophocles likes to build systems and (35:30 - 35:37)
cyrus wants to rebuild the universe (35:34 - 35:40)
yeah to cut out human emotions (35:37 - 35:42)
boy that lies in when they add lysander (35:40 - 35:44)
the game it's gonna be the same thing (35:42 - 35:44)
right (35:44 - 35:46)
oh my god well and you're all like oh no (35:44 - 35:48)
they're going to do a great job with (35:46 - 35:51)
lucid mean i'm like no they're deaf (35:48 - 35:53)
they're it's going to be like i'm (35:51 - 35:55)
completely apologetic that i tried to (35:53 - 35:57)
kill both my kids (35:55 - 35:59)
i spent some time in a coba how did i (35:57 - 36:00)
end up on this beach (35:59 - 36:04)
oh well kids don't you love your mom (36:00 - 36:06)
you have to love your mom to defeat the (36:04 - 36:07)
elite four (36:06 - 36:10)
i guess we'll love mom now yeah (36:07 - 36:12)
yeah maybe you're right i mean defeating (36:10 - 36:13)
the elite four (36:12 - 36:15)
is pretty a pretty important milestone (36:13 - 36:17)
in people's lives it is (36:15 - 36:21)
so okay last thing they talked about (36:17 - 36:25)
was that they got they received lots of (36:21 - 36:26)
feedback that people liked (36:25 - 36:29)
sync the cigna suit characters (36:26 - 36:32)
so they want to add more to the game and (36:29 - 36:34)
summer character and uh sorry (36:32 - 36:37)
event seasonal characters so people love (36:34 - 36:39)
the seasonal people love the cigna suit (36:37 - 36:41)
which actually doesn't surprise me (36:39 - 36:41)
because (36:41 - 36:43)
it's a game where you collect characters (36:41 - 36:45)
of course that is like (36:43 - 36:46)
i agree with those people like that's (36:45 - 36:48)
the thing i want to do i wanna (36:46 - 36:51)
i think cigna suit cynthia signa suit (36:48 - 36:53)
grimsley signa suit (36:51 - 36:55)
uh elisa i think there are they all look (36:53 - 36:56)
incredible (36:55 - 36:59)
they're all awesome yeah they look great (36:56 - 37:01)
and they said the next seasonal event (36:59 - 37:02)
will be in october (37:01 - 37:04)
and it will be a halloween event and so (37:02 - 37:06)
people are excited (37:04 - 37:07)
we've had two seasonal events since the (37:06 - 37:09)
game was launched one was the winter (37:07 - 37:11)
stuff and then the other was the summer (37:09 - 37:12)
stuff we just got (37:11 - 37:14)
so this will be the third one uh i (37:12 - 37:15)
thought the announcement was fine i (37:14 - 37:17)
think the ex name change is (37:15 - 37:21)
really weird i am a hundred percent sure (37:17 - 37:24)
maybe 99 sure the reason is because (37:21 - 37:28)
japan they there must be some obsession (37:24 - 37:29)
with like (37:28 - 37:32)
sticking ex at the end of things to make (37:29 - 37:34)
because japan has those huge machines (37:32 - 37:36)
that have like the slappy things it's i (37:34 - 37:37)
don't know if you've ever seen it (37:36 - 37:38)
they're at like pokemon centers (37:37 - 37:40)
yeah yeah there's like a slappy yeah (37:38 - 37:42)
there's like four of there's like four (37:40 - 37:44)
of them at every pokemon center they're (37:42 - 37:46)
these huge red looking arcade machines (37:44 - 37:49)
and you have like these little ex discs (37:46 - 37:50)
they're (37:49 - 37:53)
like little rectangles with a pokemon on (37:50 - 37:54)
it and then you slide it into the (37:53 - 37:56)
machine and it reads the pokemon (37:54 - 37:59)
and then there's just a giant red button (37:56 - 38:01)
that's all there is on this machine and (37:59 - 38:03)
you just slap that button (38:01 - 38:07)
and it's like pokemon go before pokemon (38:03 - 38:09)
go of just like hitting your finger (38:07 - 38:11)
the one button over and over in a raid (38:09 - 38:12)
battle (38:11 - 38:14)
and they change the name of that thing (38:12 - 38:15)
like every two (38:14 - 38:18)
years (38:15 - 38:18)
pokemon slap ex i i don't you get a high (38:22 - 38:27)
score (38:25 - 38:31)
okay look we'll have we'll have andrew (38:27 - 38:32)
explain it (38:31 - 38:34)
they could they change doesn't know they (38:32 - 38:36)
change these machines like every two (38:34 - 38:38)
years and they change the like shape of (38:36 - 38:39)
the (38:38 - 38:41)
rectangle slightly so you gotta buy more (38:39 - 38:43)
rectangles (38:41 - 38:46)
it's it's it's it's fascinating it's (38:43 - 38:47)
actually it was the worst (38:46 - 38:50)
i am i was hoping (38:47 - 38:52)
they were going to address the gem (38:50 - 38:54)
situation (38:52 - 38:57)
i think gems are still overpriced gems (38:54 - 38:57)
are (38:57 - 38:59)
way overpriced i still was hoping that (38:57 - 39:01)
they would say like hey we're changing (38:59 - 39:03)
it so when you do a 10-pole you're (39:01 - 39:05)
guaranteed at least (39:03 - 39:07)
two four stars like they didn't address (39:05 - 39:08)
that at all (39:07 - 39:09)
maybe they don't have to because they're (39:08 - 39:11)
making money i don't (39:09 - 39:14)
and oh this is another if they are going (39:11 - 39:16)
to release six stars (39:14 - 39:18)
then a guarantee me a four star at a ten (39:16 - 39:20)
pole just (39:18 - 39:22)
guarantee you one four star so i don't (39:20 - 39:23)
feel (39:22 - 39:27)
like i had for this last month 33 star (39:23 - 39:28)
polls in a row (39:27 - 39:31)
um they are they are giving 3 000 gems i (39:28 - 39:34)
think on august 27th that starts (39:31 - 39:37)
which is a 10 poll we i think that's all (39:34 - 39:39)
the masters news that's everything (39:37 - 39:42)
it was a big masters update sorry one (39:39 - 39:44)
year anniversary (39:42 - 39:46)
i mean it's a big thing to celebrate (39:44 - 39:49)
yeah and i will say this (39:46 - 39:52)
they have improved a lot about the game (39:49 - 39:54)
but some of these new choices have been (39:52 - 39:57)
scratching my head real hard like (39:54 - 39:59)
what don't slide back now come on i (39:57 - 40:01)
thought there would be a little bit more (39:59 - 40:04)
honestly yeah i mean they may i was like (40:01 - 40:06)
say oh they may be keeping things hidden (40:04 - 40:06)
but (40:06 - 40:10)
it's seven days away right yeah and (40:06 - 40:13)
i mean they can they've (40:10 - 40:16)
if we want to just touch on the stamina (40:13 - 40:18)
issue real quick they have definitely (40:16 - 40:21)
given out gems and given out apology (40:18 - 40:22)
stuff and (40:21 - 40:25)
have done that over the last year like (40:22 - 40:26)
hey this one bug that you didn't (40:25 - 40:28)
experience but one person (40:26 - 40:30)
out of the however many people played (40:28 - 40:31)
did here's (40:30 - 40:33)
three thousand gems sorry this we fixed (40:31 - 40:36)
it um so it's not like (40:33 - 40:37)
if something doesn't feel right or (40:36 - 40:39)
something (40:37 - 40:41)
they they also have said that the (40:39 - 40:42)
stamina system is (40:41 - 40:44)
technically a trial period and they are (40:42 - 40:46)
open to feedback you can submit that (40:44 - 40:48)
feedback through the app (40:46 - 40:50)
of what you like and what you don't like (40:48 - 40:51)
hopefully (40:50 - 40:53)
they're listening i'm sure i i know that (40:51 - 40:54)
i know they know the issue (40:53 - 40:56)
but whether they're gonna do something (40:54 - 40:58)
about it yeah it's very easy for them to (40:56 - 40:59)
give (40:58 - 41:02)
you know ten packs of stamina or (40:59 - 41:04)
gems or just straight up change it on (41:02 - 41:06)
the fly like they don't have to wait for (41:04 - 41:07)
a (41:06 - 41:09)
reason to change it it's a living game (41:07 - 41:10)
at this point they can change it when (41:09 - 41:11)
they want (41:10 - 41:14)
i would just like them to for the daily (41:11 - 41:15)
stuff (41:14 - 41:18)
at least one pack of skip tickets (41:15 - 41:20)
which i love skip tickets but they are (41:18 - 41:22)
giving out (41:20 - 41:24)
way too many i'm almost at 700 and they (41:22 - 41:25)
can't even (41:24 - 41:29)
use them is just have one of those be a (41:25 - 41:31)
hundred stamina refill (41:29 - 41:33)
would make stamina so much easier to (41:31 - 41:35)
deal with part of my daily (41:33 - 41:38)
amount was i got one of those packs of (41:35 - 41:40)
three skip tickets (41:38 - 41:43)
was just a 100 200 stamina refill (41:40 - 41:47)
we will take a break we got some vgc (41:43 - 41:48)
stuff to talk about (41:47 - 41:51)
and uh some pokemon (41:48 - 41:53)
detective pikachu stuff that has popped (41:51 - 41:55)
up (41:53 - 41:58)
so we will be right back (41:55 - 41:58)
no no no no do it right do it right i (41:59 - 42:04)
don't know what that means (42:02 - 42:07)
[Music] (42:04 - 42:09)

kickstarter link in the show notes (43:16 - 43:22)
on the slack in the discord on the (43:20 - 43:23)
twitter i probably don't have to go into (43:22 - 43:25)
it too much as the fourth week (43:23 - 43:28)
and thank you to everyone who backed (43:25 - 43:28)
it's already funded so now's the time to (43:29 - 43:33)
get in because it's going to happen (43:31 - 43:36)
yeah it's guaranteed so (43:33 - 43:39)
you know don't worry about is being at (43:36 - 43:41)
vaporware uh we know how to find steve (43:39 - 43:44)
so that's true the pokemon (43:41 - 43:47)
company has announced a rule set for the (43:44 - 43:48)
upcoming (43:47 - 43:51)
vgc series six (43:48 - 43:55)
via pokemon home uh 16 (43:51 - 43:59)
frequently used pokemon will be illegal (43:55 - 44:02)
oh you will get arrested in an upcoming (43:59 - 44:05)
competitive tournament series 6 will go (44:02 - 44:05)
live (44:05 - 44:08)
on september 1st just to be clear (44:05 - 44:11)
because i actually forgot this (44:08 - 44:13)
series five and i believe series four (44:11 - 44:16)
both lasted like two months each (44:13 - 44:19)
so we've been in season five for a while (44:16 - 44:19)
now (44:19 - 44:21)
so this is series six even though this (44:19 - 44:22)
is the like (44:21 - 44:26)
ninth month of the game i think (44:22 - 44:28)
i mean it didn't say month six it's a (44:26 - 44:29)
series six yeah (44:28 - 44:31)
but when they started it was like once a (44:29 - 44:33)
month because they were like slowly (44:31 - 44:34)
introducing (44:33 - 44:38)
gigantomax pokemon then it got weird (44:34 - 44:40)
i want to say it was caesar season four (44:38 - 44:42)
was the first two month season (44:40 - 44:44)
and then season five was two months and (44:42 - 44:45)
i'm assuming c (44:44 - 44:49)
series six will take us to crown tundra (44:45 - 44:50)
probably (44:49 - 44:52)
um all of september all of october (44:50 - 44:54)
september october yeah (44:52 - 44:57)
so probably crown tundra and then series (44:54 - 44:58)
7 will start (44:57 - 45:00)
so they uh this is what happened they (44:58 - 45:02)
took the top 10 pokemon in singles (45:00 - 45:04)
and they took the top 10 pokemon in (45:02 - 45:06)
doubles and then they just banned them (45:04 - 45:09)
um but there were over there (45:06 - 45:09)
there was overlap pokemon that are (45:10 - 45:14)
banned (45:12 - 45:18)
incineroar yup yeah (45:14 - 45:20)
that was it it was just incineroar no it (45:18 - 45:21)
was um (45:20 - 45:25)
yep hey i know my stuff yeah (45:21 - 45:29)
rilla boom togekiss cinderace (45:25 - 45:33)
incineroar yeah please (45:29 - 45:37)
indeedy both are banned for the record (45:33 - 45:41)
tyranitar whimsicott torkel (45:37 - 45:46)
dragapalt venusaur porygon2 (45:41 - 45:50)
mimikyu gyarados hippodon (45:46 - 45:53)
excadrill and magnazone so (45:50 - 45:57)
the paragon that they just gave me (45:53 - 45:57)
is banned yes porygon (45:57 - 46:03)
had to fall so dust claps could (46:00 - 46:07)
look they they did better than most tcg (46:03 - 46:08)
companies (46:07 - 46:13)
um let's not say watsy out loud (46:08 - 46:13)
make you pay for something and then ban (46:13 - 46:18)
it a month later okay (46:16 - 46:22)
but what did twerkle do torkle is really (46:18 - 46:24)
dominant in trick room teams and it (46:22 - 46:26)
helps venusaur and (46:24 - 46:29)
yeah it helps venusaur a ton and it (46:26 - 46:31)
helps it makes venusaur like the fastest (46:29 - 46:33)
pokemon in the world when (46:31 - 46:36)
when torquel's out so why are they doing (46:33 - 46:37)
this (46:36 - 46:40)
change up the meta keep it interesting (46:37 - 46:40)
and (46:40 - 46:44)
i honestly think no one would have (46:40 - 46:47)
played (46:44 - 46:47)
the players cup is happening now there (46:48 - 46:52)
were a lot of competitive people that (46:51 - 46:54)
walked away (46:52 - 46:56)
when all the tournaments were canceled (46:54 - 46:57)
for the year (46:56 - 47:00)
and i think if they would have just (46:57 - 47:02)
continued with the current rule set of (47:00 - 47:05)
season five (47:02 - 47:08)
no like no one would have played there's (47:05 - 47:09)
not a lot of like (47:08 - 47:13)
people playing now compared to (47:09 - 47:15)
you know before kovid i mean do you (47:13 - 47:17)
really think that's taking these (47:15 - 47:20)
out these 16 out will draw a bunch of (47:17 - 47:22)
people to the game yes no no no the the (47:20 - 47:23)
real thing (47:22 - 47:26)
okay uh steve might be a little bit (47:23 - 47:27)
correct because (47:26 - 47:29)
people love to complain and they're like (47:27 - 47:31)
every team is the same (47:29 - 47:34)
six pokemon it's rillaboom and (47:31 - 47:35)
cinderella together (47:34 - 47:37)
right and then they're like well yeah so (47:35 - 47:38)
you can't have those and so it's like (47:37 - 47:39)
now that every team's not gonna be those (47:38 - 47:41)
six is gonna be a different six but the (47:39 - 47:43)
real reason it's just gonna be a (47:41 - 47:44)
different six right yeah (47:43 - 47:46)
sure yeah i mean like yeah when you run (47:44 - 47:48)
meta's work yeah metas will always rise (47:46 - 47:49)
to the top (47:48 - 47:53)
but the real reason is (47:49 - 47:55)
did you notice on that list that there (47:53 - 47:57)
were no genies (47:55 - 48:00)
that were being banned that's the issue (47:57 - 48:01)
insufficient genies okay well they're (48:00 - 48:03)
not in the game yet (48:01 - 48:07)
well yeah somebody fixed that (48:03 - 48:10)
okay so you said yes this will bring (48:07 - 48:10)
people (48:10 - 48:13)
into the game into competitive support (48:10 - 48:14)
your claim (48:13 - 48:17)
support i've never i've never played vgc (48:14 - 48:18)
before (48:17 - 48:22)
ever and now they've banned 16 pokemon (48:18 - 48:22)
including (48:22 - 48:24)
all of the starters i don't think it (48:22 - 48:26)
brings new people in (48:24 - 48:28)
i think it brings people that are salty (48:26 - 48:30)
or frustrated with the meta back in and (48:28 - 48:32)
willing to try it again (48:30 - 48:34)
but it's just it just but doesn't it (48:32 - 48:36)
just create a different meta (48:34 - 48:40)
like is is the next the next pokemon (48:36 - 48:41)
after this (48:40 - 48:44)
so varied that you (48:41 - 48:47)
that you'll have a whole like 40 or 50 (48:44 - 48:48)
that you could see (48:47 - 48:50)
no no or is it see that no that's not (48:48 - 48:52)
the problem the problem is (48:50 - 48:56)
when you have a stagnant meta like all (48:52 - 48:58)
all metas will stagnate at some point (48:56 - 48:59)
because people will (48:58 - 49:01)
churn it out they'll figure out which is (48:59 - 49:02)
the best team and those (49:01 - 49:04)
those will be the best teams with small (49:02 - 49:06)
variations the problem (49:04 - 49:10)
is when a stagnant meta is in place (49:06 - 49:14)
for a year if you have the metas (49:10 - 49:16)
change up every two months people are (49:14 - 49:17)
interested because (49:16 - 49:18)
in that two months you're gonna that's (49:17 - 49:20)
when you're gonna develop the churn and (49:18 - 49:21)
everything then you play it out (49:20 - 49:23)
and then maybe towards the end of the (49:21 - 49:24)
two months that's when it becomes a (49:23 - 49:26)
little boring and it's like all these (49:24 - 49:28)
six dudes again but it's like if every (49:26 - 49:30)
two months you're changing it up so that (49:28 - 49:30)
it (49:30 - 49:33)
is a new rotation and there's a new (49:30 - 49:34)
thought process that (49:33 - 49:36)
that does keep it interesting and (49:34 - 49:38)
appealing uh a good example of (49:36 - 49:39)
how this works and i'll keep it within (49:38 - 49:42)
pokemon i could go destiny or fortnite (49:39 - 49:43)
or apex (49:42 - 49:44)
but within pokemon if you look at the (49:43 - 49:46)
pokemon trading card game (49:44 - 49:49)
you you can those metas last for three (49:46 - 49:50)
months (49:49 - 49:51)
and then a new set of cards get (49:50 - 49:53)
introduced some (49:51 - 49:55)
current metas get better some current (49:53 - 49:57)
decks and that meta get better some get (49:55 - 49:58)
worse (49:57 - 50:02)
you know dragopalt was a very good deck (49:58 - 50:06)
um before darkness ablaze and now (50:02 - 50:08)
because of eternitis and darkness ablaze (50:06 - 50:09)
which is the current set that just came (50:08 - 50:12)
out dragon pulse not really good anymore (50:09 - 50:13)
um but the problem (50:12 - 50:15)
in that meta is it there's money (50:13 - 50:17)
involved so if you don't if you can't (50:15 - 50:19)
afford to build eternitis (50:17 - 50:22)
then yes dragonfall is still good (50:19 - 50:26)
but you can have good metas and bad (50:22 - 50:26)
metas (50:26 - 50:31)
so i would argue that the dark explorers (50:26 - 50:35)
meta which both will and i played which (50:31 - 50:37)
i thought was extremely good dark cry (50:35 - 50:40)
was pretty dominant in that meta (50:37 - 50:42)
but there was still there were still (50:40 - 50:43)
ways to counter it and there was still (50:42 - 50:45)
enough variety between (50:43 - 50:47)
darkrai decks you could run darkrai with (50:45 - 50:49)
stabilize you could run darkheart with (50:47 - 50:51)
tarakion you could just run darkrai with (50:49 - 50:52)
apsil (50:51 - 50:54)
you could run darkride tarakion and (50:52 - 50:56)
sableye um and then you could just not (50:54 - 50:57)
run darkrai (50:56 - 50:59)
like you could run straight like there (50:57 - 51:01)
was a lot of variety i think (50:59 - 51:03)
in the dark explorer set and then what (51:01 - 51:06)
happened after that was the team plasma (51:03 - 51:09)
rotation started coming in i'm skipping (51:06 - 51:09)
around there was (51:09 - 51:12)
more sets in between but uh and then (51:09 - 51:15)
team plasma introduced hypnotoxic laser (51:12 - 51:18)
and um verbank jim (51:15 - 51:21)
and that was the meta like you everyone (51:18 - 51:22)
was running (51:21 - 51:24)
for hypnotax laser everyone was running (51:22 - 51:26)
verbank if you weren't running furbank (51:24 - 51:28)
you were running something to counter (51:26 - 51:29)
verbank but you still wanted to run (51:28 - 51:31)
hypnotoxic because (51:29 - 51:32)
you could take advantage of their (51:31 - 51:34)
burbank and it was just such a good card (51:32 - 51:35)
to run (51:34 - 51:38)
and that meta was bad and that meta was (51:35 - 51:39)
bad enough for me (51:38 - 51:41)
and a lot of other people to walk away (51:39 - 51:43)
from the competitive (51:41 - 51:46)
and so i think with the introduction of (51:43 - 51:47)
rillaboom (51:46 - 51:50)
uh the introduction of porygon2 back (51:47 - 51:53)
people probably walked away (51:50 - 51:56)
because like cinderella cirillo boom (51:53 - 51:59)
these these pokemon that just instantly (51:56 - 52:01)
became dominant when season five started (51:59 - 52:04)
are frustrating to deal with and there (52:01 - 52:05)
didn't really seem to be an (52:04 - 52:08)
excellent counter to those (52:05 - 52:11)
that wasn't just the default counter (52:08 - 52:13)
that people were using and dragopal (52:11 - 52:17)
has been annoying since day one uh (52:13 - 52:21)
togekiss has been annoying since day one (52:17 - 52:24)
venusaur got really good when venusaur (52:21 - 52:25)
was introduced (52:24 - 52:28)
uh but since then you know venusaur has (52:25 - 52:29)
you know been (52:28 - 52:31)
countered so i think you you remove (52:29 - 52:32)
these 16 (52:31 - 52:37)
pokemon 16 new pokemon rise to the top (52:32 - 52:40)
but the question is are those 16 pokemon (52:37 - 52:41)
going to stay dominant (52:40 - 52:44)
or is there going to be a variety of (52:41 - 52:46)
stuff that you can work with (52:44 - 52:49)
and is that going to be healthy or are (52:46 - 52:50)
people going to be like man i wish (52:49 - 52:53)
toga kiss was back or ah gosh nothing is (52:50 - 52:56)
working because whimsicott's not here (52:53 - 52:59)
and i think that's exciting and so yeah (52:56 - 53:00)
i guess that's that's my argument (52:59 - 53:01)
like the pokemon company's been doing (53:00 - 53:04)
this for 20 years with the the tcg (53:01 - 53:06)
uh and the fact that they really haven't (53:04 - 53:07)
done this with the (53:06 - 53:11)
the video game since sword and shield is (53:07 - 53:12)
well i guess they kinda did it with sun (53:11 - 53:14)
and moon with saying like megas are (53:12 - 53:16)
allowed this time but (53:14 - 53:17)
z moves are allowed this time but now (53:16 - 53:19)
you can get both (53:17 - 53:22)
i think it's exciting honestly (53:19 - 53:25)
i i definitely agree i think it's i mean (53:22 - 53:27)
the biggest complaint from the bgc (53:25 - 53:29)
community was that those meadows became (53:27 - 53:31)
stagnant and stayed stagnant for (53:29 - 53:34)
long long long periods of time so now (53:31 - 53:35)
they're (53:34 - 53:38)
they're these are real solutions for (53:35 - 53:40)
you know swapping up the meta and and (53:38 - 53:41)
making it something (53:40 - 53:43)
new for people to figure out which is (53:41 - 53:44)
what is like a huge appeal and (53:43 - 53:46)
interesting to folks (53:44 - 53:48)
yeah and i think the thing that's gonna (53:46 - 53:50)
happen starting season (53:48 - 53:52)
six is durant becomes number one i think (53:50 - 53:53)
durant (53:52 - 53:54)
rises to the top as the number one (53:53 - 53:56)
pokemon easily (53:54 - 53:59)
and then what will happen is people will (53:56 - 54:01)
probably run (53:59 - 54:05)
specific solutions to durant and then (54:01 - 54:07)
durant players will not be able to (54:05 - 54:09)
counter the solutions and they will stop (54:07 - 54:11)
running durant (54:09 - 54:14)
around four times a week to fire yeah (54:11 - 54:15)
yeah but what's (54:14 - 54:18)
out speeding durant at this point uh (54:15 - 54:21)
my trick room slow (54:18 - 54:24)
poke so like like i think the only thing (54:21 - 54:26)
that outspeeds durant is (54:24 - 54:29)
talonflame and you what do you do you (54:26 - 54:30)
like (54:29 - 54:33)
you follow me the talonflame attacks the (54:30 - 54:34)
follow me and then durant max rock falls (54:33 - 54:36)
on the talonflame and gg (54:34 - 54:38)
talonflame can't survive max rockfall (54:36 - 54:40)
are you sure that durian can learn (54:38 - 54:43)
rockfall yeah it can it can learn (54:40 - 54:44)
rockslide (54:43 - 54:46)
so that's max rockfall so the reason (54:44 - 54:48)
during rockslide now we got to start (54:46 - 54:49)
banning some movies that's what we've (54:48 - 54:50)
got to do (54:49 - 54:52)
i mean the the meta also got changed up (54:50 - 54:54)
when the move tutor stuff came out right (54:52 - 54:54)
like (54:54 - 54:56)
grassy glide wasn't a move two months (54:54 - 54:59)
ago and now people run grassy glide and (54:56 - 55:00)
the last two months were (54:59 - 55:04)
so dominated from rilla boom (55:00 - 55:06)
doing grassy glide that it was (55:04 - 55:08)
frustrating and there wasn't a real (55:06 - 55:11)
good counter to rilla boom which wasn't (55:08 - 55:12)
like in dd (55:11 - 55:15)
i think brave bird needs to become a (55:12 - 55:17)
priority move again (55:15 - 55:21)
and not have the restriction of 100 (55:17 - 55:26)
hp that's my campaign fix brave bird (55:21 - 55:28)
the reason i think durant becomes number (55:26 - 55:30)
one is because durant already (55:28 - 55:33)
came in durant i think already won a (55:30 - 55:34)
tournament before kovit and then came in (55:33 - 55:36)
second in another tournament (55:34 - 55:39)
durant's ability is hustle which is like (55:36 - 55:40)
increase (55:39 - 55:45)
moves by 20 but decrease accuracy by 20 (55:40 - 55:49)
and then durant's really fast durant has (55:45 - 55:50)
one weakness which is fire which is four (55:49 - 55:52)
times a week too (55:50 - 55:53)
but wait doesn't rockslide only have (55:52 - 55:55)
eighty percent accuracy (55:53 - 55:57)
but when you j when you dynamax your (55:55 - 55:58)
moves are a hundred percent accurate (55:57 - 56:00)
which means (55:58 - 56:04)
that wasn't in the manual which means (56:00 - 56:06)
which means which i really loved opening (56:04 - 56:07)
pokemon shield yesterday because i got a (56:06 - 56:11)
physical copy and there's nothing inside (56:07 - 56:14)
what a joke so durant does 20 more (56:11 - 56:15)
damage (56:14 - 56:17)
20 percent less accurate or something (56:15 - 56:18)
like that (56:17 - 56:22)
but when you have three turns of 100 (56:18 - 56:22)
accuracy (56:22 - 56:24)
and you're already the fastest pokemon (56:22 - 56:26)
and you can max rockfall you can max (56:24 - 56:28)
steel spike you can max (56:26 - 56:30)
whatever the other two moves they teach (56:28 - 56:31)
durant they probably give it a life orb (56:30 - 56:32)
so it does another 20 (56:31 - 56:35)
so there's nothing i i think durant (56:32 - 56:36)
becomes number one for the next (56:35 - 56:40)
week or two after september 1st but (56:36 - 56:43)
you need probably arcanine goes up (56:40 - 56:45)
arcanine goes way up (56:43 - 56:46)
i'm trying to think of other fire (56:45 - 56:48)
pokemon i was going to say maybe (56:46 - 56:49)
cinderella (56:48 - 56:51)
but cinderella's got banned i don't (56:49 - 56:54)
think heatmore is good at all (56:51 - 56:56)
but i mean heatmore's eat durians this (56:54 - 56:58)
is yeah it should be an auto win really (56:56 - 57:00)
you know you said they're during on the (56:58 - 57:01)
field heat rain on the field (57:00 - 57:03)
it's just auto win at that point at that (57:01 - 57:04)
point right (57:03 - 57:07)
yeah no heat more not heatran you've got (57:04 - 57:09)
heatran on the mind man (57:07 - 57:12)
no i said heat more i heard heatran (57:09 - 57:15)
maybe i've got heat treatment (57:12 - 57:15)
hey remember when we said urshifu was (57:16 - 57:19)
built for competitive (57:18 - 57:22)
and it avoided the ban because it was (57:19 - 57:24)
like the 11th most played not the 10th (57:22 - 57:25)
most played (57:24 - 57:28)
yep sliding in i don't i (57:25 - 57:31)
must i i would take incentive roar over (57:28 - 57:32)
urshifu (57:31 - 57:33)
any day i would rather deal with (57:32 - 57:35)
incineroar than hershey food (57:33 - 57:42)
urshifu is so annoying (57:35 - 57:44)
tail and flame i think goes way way way (57:42 - 57:47)
up charizard probably goes up (57:44 - 57:49)
i mean is talon playing telephones very (57:47 - 57:52)
fast right (57:49 - 57:52)
yes i used to i used to have a team like (57:52 - 57:55)
my (57:55 - 57:58)
during mega evolution uh vgcs i (57:55 - 58:01)
my team was based around talonflame you (57:58 - 58:04)
know when brave bird was good (58:01 - 58:06)
but whatever can't go back in time i (58:04 - 58:09)
guess yeah talonflame outspeeds durant (58:06 - 58:12)
but like easy right easy (58:09 - 58:16)
tailwind durant's 109 talonflame's 129. (58:12 - 58:20)
um charizard does not outspeed durant (58:16 - 58:23)
but what can durant do to charizard max (58:20 - 58:24)
rockfall (58:23 - 58:27)
yeah max right you've got gigantomax (58:24 - 58:30)
charizard like i think that's a win (58:27 - 58:32)
still weak to rock type moves (58:30 - 58:33)
but yeah four times yeah charizard (58:32 - 58:35)
charizard and talonflame are both weak (58:33 - 58:36)
to (58:35 - 58:38)
both four times a week to rock fall rock (58:36 - 58:39)
moves (58:38 - 58:41)
and durant one durian one shots and if (58:39 - 58:42)
for some reason (58:41 - 58:44)
talonflame and charizard were running (58:42 - 58:46)
focus which they're not (58:44 - 58:48)
the sandstorm then kills if it doesn't (58:46 - 58:49)
one shot (58:48 - 58:51)
and all you need to pair with durant is (58:49 - 58:52)
follow me right (58:51 - 58:53)
so if you're like oh i'm just going to (58:52 - 58:56)
use a fire move against durant you just (58:53 - 58:58)
whatev literally anything can sit there (58:56 - 58:59)
and follow me and take the fire type (58:58 - 59:01)
move so durant doesn't (58:59 - 59:04)
so what happened to brave bird uh so (59:01 - 59:05)
they nerfed it (59:04 - 59:08)
where um the it wasn't the ability (59:05 - 59:10)
wasn't it it wasn't the move (59:08 - 59:13)
no big pecks was the ability oh (59:10 - 59:16)
i don't know they nerfed brave birds so (59:13 - 59:18)
you had to be at 100 health (59:16 - 59:21)
no it wasn't it's it's a (59:18 - 59:25)
no no no no no it's ability (59:21 - 59:28)
gail wings gave it priority scaling (59:25 - 59:31)
they always gave that's the one priority (59:28 - 59:32)
i'm an old man (59:31 - 59:35)
it's like i've seen people use brave (59:32 - 59:36)
bird (59:35 - 59:37)
way lower than they've knocked (59:36 - 59:40)
themselves out so okay so this is what (59:37 - 59:40)
happened (59:40 - 59:43)
so in generation six when talonflame was (59:40 - 59:44)
introduced (59:43 - 59:48)
gail wings the ability gave priority to (59:44 - 59:51)
any flying type move and then in (59:48 - 59:51)
generation (59:51 - 59:54)
seven gale wings only works when the (59:51 - 59:55)
user is at (59:54 - 59:58)
full hp do you get one (59:55 - 60:01)
shot so what people did since gen (59:58 - 60:06)
7 is they tailwind on turn one (60:01 - 60:08)
because they're guaranteed to go first (60:06 - 60:09)
because tailwind is a (60:08 - 60:12)
flying type move and because tailwind is (60:09 - 60:15)
then set up because the gale wings (60:12 - 60:17)
you're going to win the speed battle (60:15 - 60:19)
after that (60:17 - 60:22)
so i i do think that talonflame is going (60:19 - 60:24)
to go super super up (60:22 - 60:26)
but i don't know what the i don't know (60:24 - 60:27)
what the (60:26 - 60:28)
know what the easy solution against (60:27 - 60:30)
durant is unless you (60:28 - 60:32)
taunt the person who's going to use (60:30 - 60:34)
follow me but i think follow me has (60:32 - 60:37)
priority over taunt so that doesn't work (60:34 - 60:39)
what if i have a prankster sableye i (60:37 - 60:41)
think follow me is plus two priority (60:39 - 60:42)
right (60:41 - 60:45)
taunt is only plus one is it (60:42 - 60:48)
look i don't know where okay (60:45 - 60:51)
yes where does it say follow me is plus (60:48 - 60:52)
two (60:51 - 60:54)
taunt is plus zero and well let me say (60:52 - 60:56)
the real name of the move is follow the (60:54 - 60:57)
finger (60:56 - 60:59)
because that's the name of your japanese (60:57 - 61:02)
and that's a much better name (60:59 - 61:04)
yeah dust claps probably should have (61:02 - 61:05)
been banned it was so (61:04 - 61:07)
dominant the first couple seasons and (61:05 - 61:09)
then porygon 2 came out and then poor (61:07 - 61:11)
gun 2 was better than dusk claps but (61:09 - 61:12)
porygon 2 (61:11 - 61:15)
suffered the ban instead which is pr (61:12 - 61:17)
probably i don't know probably better (61:15 - 61:19)
but dust klopp's will (61:17 - 61:22)
is back um hershey foo is still good (61:19 - 61:24)
arcanine will probably go way up (61:22 - 61:27)
uh the swords of justice (61:24 - 61:30)
are probably going to go way up to (61:27 - 61:31)
rakian (61:30 - 61:33)
and kobat kobelian specifically no one (61:31 - 61:35)
uses varisian (61:33 - 61:38)
dracovish avoided the ban grim snarl (61:35 - 61:38)
avoided (61:38 - 61:41)
the ban poly rain teams go super super (61:38 - 61:42)
up (61:41 - 61:44)
uh rain rain unfortunately was not (61:42 - 61:46)
dominant people thought because polly (61:44 - 61:48)
toad was returning with the isle of (61:46 - 61:49)
armor (61:48 - 61:51)
that we would see a lot of rain teams (61:49 - 61:52)
because polly polytoad is a way better (61:51 - 61:53)
rain setter than (61:52 - 61:57)
peliper was uh (61:53 - 61:59)
zumerel with huge power came through the (61:57 - 62:01)
olive armor but (61:59 - 62:03)
because of the dominance of rilaboom we (62:01 - 62:05)
didn't really see rain teams so we'll (62:03 - 62:06)
probably see a lot of rain teams in (62:05 - 62:09)
season six i'm assuming (62:06 - 62:12)
uh doraledon not banned so that's safe (62:09 - 62:14)
uh corvo knight probably goes way way (62:12 - 62:16)
way way up corverne has a really good (62:14 - 62:18)
showing with the players cup (62:16 - 62:20)
this this past weekend so carver knight (62:18 - 62:23)
is probably going to be fine (62:20 - 62:26)
um i'm assuming colossal is still safe (62:23 - 62:30)
gothitel was pretty we used quite often (62:26 - 62:32)
in the first couple seasons um so i (62:30 - 62:34)
would probably see gothel returning (62:32 - 62:37)
my boy gastrodon still safe uh (62:34 - 62:39)
comfey has been seeing a lot of play so (62:37 - 62:41)
i would assume that comfey goes way way (62:39 - 62:42)
up as well (62:41 - 62:46)
mudsdale safe mods yeah mozdale is (62:42 - 62:49)
mudsville very dominant season one two (62:46 - 62:50)
and three (62:49 - 62:52)
and it was when season four came which (62:50 - 62:55)
was gigantomax lapras where mudsdale (62:52 - 62:55)
went from like (62:55 - 62:58)
five percent usage to less than one (62:55 - 62:59)
percent usage (62:58 - 63:02)
oh i've got a shiny one of those (62:59 - 63:05)
naturally caught in the wild so i think (63:02 - 63:06)
it's exciting (63:05 - 63:09)
uh well i guess we'll see no no more (63:06 - 63:10)
really boom no more dragopaltin almost (63:09 - 63:11)
cinderease (63:10 - 63:16)
so no more super luck togekiss (63:11 - 63:19)
well until season seven or series seven (63:16 - 63:20)
yeah (63:19 - 63:23)
the other thing the the other actual (63:20 - 63:24)
takeaway here (63:23 - 63:27)
is that a lot of competitive players (63:24 - 63:28)
were worried about (63:27 - 63:32)
the forces of nature returning (63:28 - 63:33)
that is your thundurus your tornadoes (63:32 - 63:35)
your landorus (63:33 - 63:38)
bringing back the genies they they have (63:35 - 63:42)
they're not genies they uh they don't (63:38 - 63:43)
grant wishes (63:42 - 63:47)
not all genies great wishes i know rude (63:43 - 63:49)
they were very dominant they've always (63:47 - 63:51)
been dominant all (63:49 - 63:53)
all three of those i think both (63:51 - 63:54)
thundurus (63:53 - 63:58)
and tornados have prankster (63:54 - 64:00)
and landorus has intimidate so the fact (63:58 - 64:01)
that they ban (64:00 - 64:04)
these pokemon means that (64:01 - 64:07)
if the forces of nature become dominant (64:04 - 64:08)
when the crown tundra comes out which we (64:07 - 64:10)
know they're coming (64:08 - 64:11)
in crown tundra as well as the tapus we (64:10 - 64:13)
know the tapies are coming because they (64:11 - 64:14)
were in the trailer as well (64:13 - 64:17)
they could be banned in future seasons (64:14 - 64:18)
uh which will probably be the case (64:17 - 64:19)
because i don't see (64:18 - 64:22)
how landorus doesn't make it top 10 uh (64:19 - 64:23)
once it comes back (64:22 - 64:27)
so that's good that's better than it's (64:23 - 64:28)
almost like (64:27 - 64:31)
at e3 when they stood on stage (64:28 - 64:34)
and they said the reason we cut pokemon (64:31 - 64:37)
was for a better competitive meta and (64:34 - 64:39)
everyone on reddit who has no clue how (64:37 - 64:40)
competitive works (64:39 - 64:42)
threw their arms up in the air and (64:40 - 64:44)
pointed at g-max dreadnough which has a (64:42 - 64:46)
less than (64:44 - 64:50)
0.5 use rate (64:46 - 64:50)
it's almost like they've had dreadnought (64:50 - 64:57)
for the record is 0.02 percent use rate (64:53 - 64:59)
sad it's almost like they weren't lying (64:57 - 65:00)
to us (64:59 - 65:04)
that there was has been a pretty healthy (65:00 - 65:07)
meta in the vgc for the last nine months (65:04 - 65:10)
and it's nice that it's changed so often (65:07 - 65:11)
and they've introduced (65:10 - 65:13)
new pokemon and they've now removed (65:11 - 65:14)
pokemon (65:13 - 65:19)
that have dominated so uh i'm excited (65:14 - 65:21)
i think my mudsdale will be good again (65:19 - 65:22)
okay (65:21 - 65:23)
two more news pieces of news this is off (65:22 - 65:25)
silicon era (65:23 - 65:28)
pokemon lead interface designer wants (65:25 - 65:29)
your feedback that title is a little (65:28 - 65:30)
misleading (65:29 - 65:34)
dave gibson who works at creatures (65:30 - 65:36)
not game freak uh it's creatures (65:34 - 65:38)
incorporated thank you thank you (65:36 - 65:39)
[Music] (65:38 - 65:43)
they tweeted what ui (65:39 - 65:46)
ux mistakes drive you absolutely mad in (65:43 - 65:48)
pokemon games i want to ship the next (65:46 - 65:51)
game with a top-end experience and your (65:48 - 65:51)
feedback (65:51 - 65:54)
is invaluable so they tweeted this so a (65:51 - 65:56)
couple things one (65:54 - 65:59)
they work at creatures not game freak (65:56 - 66:01)
number two (65:59 - 66:03)
in their actual twitter bio they say (66:01 - 66:05)
they're working on detective pikachu (66:03 - 66:09)
[Laughter] (66:05 - 66:13)
so i am sure they were bombarded with (66:09 - 66:17)
tons of things unrelated to the two (66:13 - 66:20)
uh i'm not saying that you can't say to (66:17 - 66:22)
them like (66:20 - 66:25)
hey specifically in sword and shield i (66:22 - 66:26)
hated that the (66:25 - 66:29)
x button did this or whatever because (66:26 - 66:30)
the ui and ux so (66:29 - 66:33)
that's user interface so that's what's (66:30 - 66:35)
the ux for hotshot (66:33 - 66:37)
the x is the user experience thank you (66:35 - 66:38)
very much (66:37 - 66:41)
so this is how a person interacts with (66:38 - 66:43)
the menus and the actual game not (66:41 - 66:45)
specifically mechanics like so being (66:43 - 66:48)
like man i wish toga kiss (66:45 - 66:50)
super luck wasn't at 30 like that's not (66:48 - 66:51)
what they're (66:50 - 66:52)
nothing to do with abilities it's just (66:51 - 66:54)
like how you interact with the product (66:52 - 66:55)
so a really good (66:54 - 66:58)
user interface or user experience (66:55 - 67:01)
problem would be i'm playing sword and (66:58 - 67:02)
shield (67:01 - 67:05)
i went to pokemon home they both have pc (67:02 - 67:06)
boxes (67:05 - 67:09)
why are the buttons different that is i (67:06 - 67:12)
i knew that is exactly where you were (67:09 - 67:13)
going (67:12 - 67:15)
that's like i knew that was number one (67:13 - 67:17)
and then number two is gonna be i hate (67:15 - 67:19)
the noises that the menus make when you (67:17 - 67:21)
press the buttons that there's like a (67:19 - 67:23)
screeching noise (67:21 - 67:24)
that's not well i guess that's an (67:23 - 67:26)
experience but i can't (67:24 - 67:30)
i can just mute that okay if (67:26 - 67:33)
your solution to a user experience (67:30 - 67:33)
problem (67:33 - 67:37)
is to modify the outputs of the system (67:33 - 67:40)
then that's a a problem that needs to be (67:37 - 67:41)
solved (67:40 - 67:43)
yeah i mean i still think that the home (67:41 - 67:45)
and pokemon sword and shield should have (67:43 - 67:46)
the same buttons (67:45 - 67:49)
oh you're the only person who has this (67:46 - 67:49)
great (67:49 - 67:52)
greg back me up i don't want to but (67:49 - 67:58)
you're right (67:52 - 67:58)
they should you should pay attention (67:58 - 68:05)
to what's happening on the screen and (68:03 - 68:07)
not just assume (68:05 - 68:10)
that every button press is gonna be (68:07 - 68:13)
the same across platforms (68:10 - 68:15)
yeah but they they teach you how to do (68:13 - 68:16)
it and then they're like (68:15 - 68:19)
or nah it's just they could make it (68:16 - 68:22)
better it doesn't have to be that way (68:19 - 68:25)
i will i will give that to you yes (68:22 - 68:27)
i mean you know i don't want to say yes (68:25 - 68:29)
but i have no choice (68:27 - 68:32)
i think the actual news story here isn't (68:29 - 68:34)
specifically like (68:32 - 68:37)
like i i don't actually care the ant (68:34 - 68:38)
what the answers are (68:37 - 68:40)
that people are given this dude i think (68:38 - 68:42)
the cool i think the cool thing here is (68:40 - 68:46)
one we found somebody who has admitted (68:42 - 68:48)
they're working on detective pikachu (68:46 - 68:50)
a game yeah a game we haven't heard (68:48 - 68:51)
about in in (68:50 - 68:54)
what a year now yeah i mean it's been a (68:51 - 68:55)
while (68:54 - 68:57)
and two we have found somebody who works (68:55 - 68:59)
at creatures (68:57 - 69:03)
this has been like the mystery person (68:59 - 69:05)
like we we know like a handful of people (69:03 - 69:06)
that work at game freak (69:05 - 69:08)
we don't know we know game freak has (69:06 - 69:09)
like 200 employees (69:08 - 69:12)
we know like five of them uh one being (69:09 - 69:15)
james turner one being masuda one being (69:12 - 69:18)
i can't remember the other ones (69:15 - 69:21)
but we we found a an english speaking (69:18 - 69:24)
employee at creatures working on (69:21 - 69:26)
detective pikachu which that's not the (69:24 - 69:27)
surprise we know that creatures was the (69:26 - 69:29)
one that made detective pikachu for the (69:27 - 69:30)
3ds so (69:29 - 69:32)
we kind of just assumed that they were (69:30 - 69:34)
making detective pikachu for the switch (69:32 - 69:38)
so i think that in itself is is news uh (69:34 - 69:40)
i i wouldn't be surprised if this tweet (69:38 - 69:42)
gets deleted in the future because the (69:40 - 69:43)
pokemon company is real weird about that (69:42 - 69:44)
kind of stuff (69:43 - 69:47)
uh but silicon era said they scanned the (69:44 - 69:49)
tweets the things that popped up the (69:47 - 69:50)
most (69:49 - 69:52)
was sword and shield players were want (69:50 - 69:54)
touchscreen controls for menus (69:52 - 69:56)
when the switch is in handheld mode um (69:54 - 69:58)

last week's pokemon um what i didn't say (75:42 - 75:48)
in the clues and everything uh is known (75:45 - 75:54)
as the poor man's gastrodon (75:48 - 75:56)
or aka why aren't you using gastrodocs (75:54 - 75:58)
why is she using gasoline (75:56 - 76:01)
yes it was my pokemon named tickles from (75:58 - 76:02)
the 2012 u.s (76:01 - 76:07)
nationals vgc competition uh it knows (76:02 - 76:11)
fischer which is a one hit knockout move (76:07 - 76:14)
but it only has like a 25 accuracy so (76:11 - 76:15)
nobody ever uses it (76:14 - 76:18)
because you're gonna lose uh also knows (76:15 - 76:20)
aqua tail earthquake and future (76:18 - 76:24)
site and future site (76:20 - 76:26)
has the ability anticipation which it's (76:24 - 76:29)
like one of the few non-psychic types (76:26 - 76:30)
that has that ability and (76:29 - 76:32)
thank you i didn't look up the twitter (76:30 - 76:34)
somebody wrote me on twitter about (76:32 - 76:37)
why this particular pokemon has (76:34 - 76:39)
like the anticipation and the earthquake (76:37 - 76:40)
and fisher and everything (76:39 - 76:44)
oh yeah there's there's reasons (76:40 - 76:46)
if you look at some japanese lore and (76:44 - 76:47)
history (76:46 - 76:50)
um and uh smogon um (76:47 - 76:53)
i read a little piece off smogon about (76:50 - 76:54)
how basically (76:53 - 76:57)
it's awful even in the lowest (76:54 - 77:00)
usage (76:57 - 77:00)
of pu (77:00 - 77:04)
[Music] (77:04 - 77:12)
bar boat go go further go deeper (77:08 - 77:16)
does not have a w on its it's not a head (77:12 - 77:19)
evolved pokemon (77:16 - 77:19)
i had to say the wrong pokemon i knew (77:20 - 77:23)
what it was (77:22 - 77:26)
yeah i mean you were there so i mean so (77:23 - 77:27)
are those (77:26 - 77:31)
w's on its side like on the barbouche (77:27 - 77:35)
it's like the charlie brown symbol (77:31 - 77:39)
ah like his shirt yeah (77:35 - 77:42)
and it just becomes the w for win and (77:39 - 77:46)
i'm going to say it now whiz cash has (77:42 - 77:48)
maybe the best pokemon shuffle icon does (77:46 - 77:49)
it really (77:48 - 77:53)
of all time i love it so much (77:49 - 77:57)
is it like a derpy face it's so cute (77:53 - 78:00)
it's just smiling straight at you the (77:57 - 78:01)
thing is whiskash (78:00 - 78:04)
it's like it's a great poke i mean for a (78:01 - 78:09)
water type pokemon it is a great pokemon (78:04 - 78:12)
and yet it just gets like short changed (78:09 - 78:14)
in every possible way (78:12 - 78:18)
yeah no gas are done well i mean yes (78:14 - 78:19)
it's no gastrodon but you know the nice (78:18 - 78:21)
thing you don't have to worry about (78:19 - 78:22)
which side of hoe when you go (78:21 - 78:25)
sinnoh you got it from look at that (78:22 - 78:27)
shiny dude look at that (78:25 - 78:30)
shiny that is glorious it is a good (78:27 - 78:31)
shiny too (78:30 - 78:34)
great shuffle good shiny no (78:31 - 78:37)
trivia no trivia at all that's not right (78:34 - 78:40)
that can't be wishcast is based on (78:37 - 78:42)
namazu a catfish and japanese mythology (78:40 - 78:44)
that causes earthquakes (78:42 - 78:47)
uh i like wish cash okay so the other (78:44 - 78:48)
thing (78:47 - 78:51)
uh is that um (78:48 - 78:54)
not only do they think that uh catfish (78:51 - 78:54)
can (78:54 - 78:56)
caught or they had the thing about (78:54 - 78:58)
catfish causing (78:56 - 79:00)
earthquakes there was also a time where (78:58 - 79:02)
they felt that catfish could predict (79:00 - 79:04)
earthquakes so that's why it has (79:02 - 79:05)
anticipation (79:04 - 79:08)
and uh future site (79:05 - 79:10)
so that it can like see into the future (79:08 - 79:12)
future can we just (79:10 - 79:14)
stop for a minute and say how dumb of a (79:12 - 79:16)
move future site is (79:14 - 79:18)
it does no damage until like what two (79:16 - 79:19)
turns later (79:18 - 79:22)
yeah accurate it's not great but if you (79:19 - 79:25)
predict it and they forget (79:22 - 79:28)
when it's true you know so (79:25 - 79:32)
confident in your future sight (79:28 - 79:34)
there you go all right this week's (79:32 - 79:36)
pokemon of the week has (79:34 - 79:38)
no shuffle icon or shiny because it's (79:36 - 79:39)

paragraphs but it's in there don't you (80:23 - 80:26)

basis (80:26 - 80:30)
all right here we go non-pokemon pokemon (80:28 - 80:33)
of the week okay if you are planning on (80:30 - 80:34)
taking up (80:33 - 80:36)
mountain biking as a hobby be prepared (80:34 - 80:38)
to learn quite a few things (80:36 - 80:39)
we learned so much about your life in (80:38 - 80:41)
these things i do my best (80:39 - 80:44)
one mountain bikes specifically full (80:41 - 80:46)
suspension mountain bikes (80:44 - 80:49)
are incredibly expensive number two (80:46 - 80:51)
there are multiple variations on (80:49 - 80:52)
mountain biking (80:51 - 80:56)
cross country enduro downhill free ride (80:52 - 80:59)
trail and others three (80:56 - 81:01)
you need a lot of protective gear and (80:59 - 81:04)
you're still going to get hurt (81:01 - 81:07)
in hoenn bikes played a particularly (81:04 - 81:09)
important role for the progression of (81:07 - 81:09)
the game (81:09 - 81:12)
requiring mastery of two types of bikes (81:09 - 81:13)
to access (81:12 - 81:16)
certain portions of the map the mock (81:13 - 81:17)
bike (81:16 - 81:19)
which has the greatest similarity to a (81:17 - 81:21)
road or gravel bike (81:19 - 81:23)
is the faster of the two bikes and (81:21 - 81:25)
allows you to go up muddy slopes or (81:23 - 81:27)
cross cracked tiles without falling (81:25 - 81:28)
through (81:27 - 81:31)
personally i was never able to master (81:28 - 81:32)
the mock bike (81:31 - 81:34)
and had someone else complete sky pillar (81:32 - 81:36)
for me as my dexterity was (81:34 - 81:40)
insufficient this week's non-pokemon (81:36 - 81:40)
item (81:40 - 81:43)
is the other bike the one that is most (81:40 - 81:45)
similar to a mountain bike (81:43 - 81:47)
you are able to perform tricks with this (81:45 - 81:50)
bike including wheelies and bunny hops (81:47 - 81:52)
one of the most useful features of this (81:50 - 81:55)
bike is the ability to bunny hop in one (81:52 - 81:56)
place (81:55 - 81:58)
which attracts the attention of wild (81:56 - 81:59)
pokemon without (81:58 - 82:02)
incrementing your step count (81:59 - 82:05)
there you go it's either easy or hard (82:02 - 82:08)
depends on your life experiences folks (82:05 - 82:10)
uh what uh will when i eventually get (82:08 - 82:12)
into minnesota when my wife finds a job (82:10 - 82:14)

the money into the youtube so (83:55 - 84:00)

the (84:20 - 84:24)
the twitch stream we highly edit it we (84:21 - 84:25)
put it on youtube (84:24 - 84:28)

primarily (85:13 - 85:17)
i dropped my phone in the bathroom and (85:14 - 85:19)
that was enough to crack the screen and (85:17 - 85:21)
it's real hard to play cafe mix with a (85:19 - 85:22)
cracked screen (85:21 - 85:26)
oh no that's what you get for having (85:22 - 85:27)
