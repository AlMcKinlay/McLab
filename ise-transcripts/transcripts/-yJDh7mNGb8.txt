[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 2 400 episode of the pokemon podcast the 342nd it's what are numbers super effective i am your host sbj with me is will i'm angry at you and greg so introduce that dude before i have my chance to to speak my piece introducing greg i will i'm i am working through my disappointment my team team mello yellow did very poorly in the 2020 marble league it was a good league it was a very exciting year but i am very disappointed with mellow yellow showings yellow team always loses they don't always lose well fall guys would say differently oh well you and your fall guys and your marbles this is a pokemon podcast and now i'm going to say what i got i yesterday purchased this fantastic game called pokemon shield and i started playing it why didn't you guys tell me that pokemon shield is better than i pokemon sword you've been holding out on me for this entire time like what has this been like eleven eight nine months okay look we told you that that was a better game a long time ago but also we didn't tell you at the beginning because we wanted you to play the bad game and transfer pokemon over to us [Laughter] [Music] so i have to suffer for your benefit yeah like you like suffering as it is we are just giving you what you want i mean that's why people listen to the show because they like to hear me suffer yes i object strike strike strike strike as i heard from greg this is a lesson i've learned what have a show for you all we have um some lots of vgc stuff some pokemon video game championship stuff there was the it is the time it is the one year anniversary for pokemon masters and i guess we could probably spend two hours on all the makeup day events for pokemon go but we'll give you the quick summary as well but let's start off with none of that news [Music] getting right into it and there is a gallerian sir fetched doesn't really make sense because sir fetch is only surface vbox in the uh pokemon tcg that will come out on september 25th that's the news the four booster packs one oversized gallerian surf hv one promo card how many packs of primal clash am i getting you know i'm not seeing any primal clash here i see uh i see some xy evolutions may as well have been primal clash i see uh bass sword and shield think i'm seeing two darkness ablaze so not the worst xy evolutions does have about 18 different charizards in it well charizard's the best which is why it's winning second in the poll right now i i think i'd have to check i don't have it in front of me but i'm gonna save this off the top of my head so take it with a grain of salt i'm pretty sure xy evolutions was the best-selling tcg set of all time which came after x and y but before the sun and moon set but also at the same time pokemon go pokemon go dropped so it's kind of no surprise if they re print the base set during the time where people got back into pokemon marketing 101 i guess but uh a rising pokemon lifts all pokemon uh but i you know they still got a you know a couple packs lying around they're just thrown into this booster box starting in that box well they're not gonna sell themselves well hey you know what i just had a realization the one good thing about them not having pokemon worlds this year is we don't have to listen to steve complain that he got the crummy tcg when everybody else got the good one crimson invasion well i wouldn't have complained if it was xy evolutions xy evolutions at least has a chance of charging i will not confirm or deny that we have spoken to the pokemon company about making sure you get poor packs because they send you a ton of gifts what do we get steve they don't necessarily when's the last time they sent me something they sent you an advent calendar yeah i didn't get an admin oh yeah they did send me an account oh yeah they did uh just refer to uh articles 6.7 paragraph three in uh my legal complaint about things that steve gets that will doesn't get yeah hey i offered you a free ticket provided by the pokemon company to the power of us yeah and i took it and i took it instead of recording a podcast with will and i still regret that choice i i i don't recall any of that i got you you i heard that you purchased pokemon shield will i have uh money i have an extra copy of the pokemon shield dlc that nintendo provided me that i can send you away hey now we're talking since i already paid for sword i would appreciate that would be very helpful so i can have a living pokedex that has both a kubfu and an urshifu see there you go i'm always i'm always looking out for my podcast and boys no you're not section 7.6 paragraph 4 how you're not always looking out for your pokemon non-gender-specific co-hosts what if i told you there was a free battle ready porygon 2 for people who are on the podcast this for everybody it's on the website i'm looking at it right now it's a code oh well i mean that doesn't mean it's also not for you i already got it so as we're recording this it is the pokemon players cup this weekend at one po at one point they they showed the code on screen and it was nothing but twitch chat doing exclamation point code in the chat over and over before the broadcast even started trying to figure out what the code was and then they showed it and then twitch cat twitch chat calmed down but uh this is a battle ready porygon uh i posted the code on our twitter instagram all that stuff in the slack in the discord and then quickly learned how many people don't read the slack in the discord as they continued to post the code even though it was in the announcements channel but that's okay you live and learn you try to help out yeah am i am i not subscribed to the announcements channel what you have to be you can't unsubscribe from it i could do lots of things porygon is good until august 31st so plenty of time i don't like that that they said battle ready here because they locked the speed iv to be zero and the attack iv to be zero which is good but then the other ivs are not good the other ivs are randomized so you have to bottle cap those you don't want to bottle cap the speed because porygon has been for trick room um so they did lock those they did ev train it it does have a proper moveset and item it's just weird that they like didn't just give it perfect ivs in the spots where you would perfect iv yet and you could be like well bottle cap it which yeah totally but it's level 50 so you have to get it to 100 then bottle cap it and i think the only reason that's like a minor complaint is because several hours a couple hours before porygon they released a gastrodon and it was perfect ivs and bottle caps and like it was actually ready to go um so i'm not sure was this like somebody's porygon or this is not somebody's porygon uh the ot will be vgc20 and it will come with a ribbon and it will come in a cherish ball the gastrodon was a korean players gastrodon which is ended that was only like a 36 hour distribution like the amungus not shiny but cherish ball butt ribbon perfect ivs perfect zero speed good uh move set cherish ball that one is done i wanted that one if you missed it you missed it oh i missed it i didn't post it in announcements i'm opening slack now because i'm pretty sure i am not in announcements or i have it like on super mute you could you could mute announcements i guess you could take this the kind step to text i know and honestly the things that he does text us what did i not text you about the moon i feel like i did text you about the mungus which was not necessary since i whatever i listen i just i there are times when i just don't understand you look i i i post it on twitter in the discord on the slack in the instagram now you're asking for personal text messages no i want shared text messages with me and greg that yeah nothing personal about it you haven't joined any of my heatran raids we've got likes with you at your bachelor party i'm not sullying our perfect heat trend dream with this remote raid four dollar rip-off scam how much of my life do you need to control you don't even live here remote rates are cheaper than actual rates right now hey get my wife a job and i'll be in minnesota this is not from lack of effort i heard she applied for a new job last night awesome it's a real awkward time to apply for a job probably the best time to move though to be fair it is i mean you could just move you know i thought about it [Music] i definitely just thought about it uh pokemon masters uh there's a lot here in pokemon masters yeah they're uh fire up the gardenscapes i'm gonna i'm pulling this off pokemon.com they put out like a 10 minute video i don't know if will or greg saw it i watched it why why why would i do that well what because i didn't text it to you because you got to adapt maybe if you saw the video well you would have been like i want to play pokemon masters now maybe if i was uh not with this update partner with dina i'd put forth the effort but dina did not reach out to me what if well look do you get you want to sign some paperwork dna i'm sure i can move you right on in what if i told you will that you're no longer playing pokemon masters but instead you're playing pokemon masters ex i mean please waste your breath and tell me that because i am unmoved but the name change is to reflect the many new experiences the game has to offer since its release that's off pokemon have a match three component nope yeah i'm out what about a six sta a star ex sink pair i hear the disgruntledness in your voice greg as this is a podcast i cannot see your face i'm sure it is there's a friend it is sour and frowny emoji emoji frown frown frown let's put uh emotions aside here is this a thing that other gotcha games do they go from five to six is this common i have never seen this i wasn't expecting that answer i don't even understand what that means they go from five to six what are they supposed to do go from five to ten well i think five is the rarest yes and now they're saying that you can take now they're gonna go to a six star ex which is this it's so dumb okay with the addition of six star ex inc pairs your str your strength and potential will increase okay obviously uh after you train a five star sink pair and meet certain conditions you will be able to raise async pairs potential the six star elevating the power even more as a bonus six star sink pairs will also get to wear different color outfits only a few sink pairs will be raised to level six any new sync pair added to the game over time will become six star ex and overtime all existing sync pairs will have the capability one of the first sink pairs you will be able to raise the six star is red and charizard okay there's other changes but the outfit thing is cool i i like outfits uh i'm a bit bummed that our own character still has the same outfit yep saw or i saw somebody point out that the in the trailer they only had one red one out of five reds and it was six star which i think you need three out of five for um what's that called grid yeah so that's good i think um but we don't know anything really else about this unless i'm missing something greg no i so this is purely a function of the fact that they start at three this is in essence saying we're adding a fourth star we just call it six stars the frustrating thing that they're doing is they still haven't really sync grids for every character they are going to release things going forward that will have the six star of and eventually get back to everybody else and the main thing that this does is makes all getting all of the old sync pairs that you already don't enjoy getting from your polls even worse because they're all so many of them are already stuck and you can't use them at all and you you are now we're now in a thing where we're getting so few gems again we're getting like everything's cut back oh speaking of back did they always do the 80 gems a day for doing your life no that's that the 80 times a day is a new is a new thing from for a dailies i forget what it used to be you still was when they got rid of bingo right yeah well they saw bingo no it's when they got rid of because you used to have daily used to get a daily voucher to increase your pair and now you get the 80 gems instead i think that's better it's a little bit better it's still not enough announcing that you're doing six stars and of course you're picking charizard it's like so the ones that are already overpowered are only going to get worse and they have no real reason to go back and fix things even though they say they will they've been saying they're going to really sink grids for everybody and we are nowhere near that like nowhere near having full secrets for older characters and so by the time they implement this that gap will be so wide then it just makes getting those older ones so much worse do you think the secret problem is because it's complicated yes because i mean in a word the secret thing is really is really complicated the first time i went to do synchron i was like it's it's very intimidating yes there's no instruction no uh you can redo it which i don't think they make clear but then the worry is if i put the stuff in it and then it's wrong am i stuck with this but you you can like clear it out and get your orbs back or whatever yeah the thing is is like it doesn't really it doesn't explain what the different paths do like the game is not unless you are a stat wonk the game isn't great at explaining to you how this changes things like if i go down this path what am i getting i still don't know what speed that's in the game it's it's really a juice i use like the samurai and it's like increased speed and i'm like okay but i don't feel like i'm fast here what is it oh i was gonna say it can attack first but i guess not it's real time yeah yeah it's what i understand for speed is it increases how quickly the move gauge refills but i think the first two or three levels it's so not noticeable that intellect is pretty high then you'll see it fill up really quick but yeah i i i i i mean the only reason i slightly know synchronous is because my twitch chat was like the max amount of or sink orbs you put into a grid is 750 and they're like you can't go above you can go above 750 but you can't spend more than 750 and nowhere does the game tell you that right and like so i put 750 into skyla because they're like because my twitch chat was like oh skyla is awesome um and i think the pokemon masters subreddit also loves skyla skyla a three star sync pair so i i i did two things and i i'm going to blame my twitch chat but number one is i put 750 sync orbs into skyla to then realize that i can't even spend all 750 because i don't have skyla alway already leveled up because skyla was a limited time event and she's not there anymore i know that now and i've i've lived with that mistake and that's fine like it's not like those sync orbs have gone to you could maybe argue they've gone to waste but they're they're still sitting there so when skyla does come back i can then use the rest of them but if i was limited on sync orbs i could have used that for another character but if you're just like a basic if you if you love if you like masters and you're not visiting the subreddit and you're not listening to podcasts and you're not watching i don't know masters youtube videos you you have no clue and the thing is is like try out builds but they they're very obtuse they're very they aren't clear as to what ones like if i go down this path is it the stuff that's touching it unlocks like because there's stuff that's locked and you're like well does that unlock by me leveling up does that unlock by me spending my secret like the game is terrible explaining how this really complicated system is as a result i have not really done anything with sync orbs because it's hard to invest in a sync grid when they are especially now announcing oh hey we're going to have super powered pairs coming out it's like okay well i don't want to spend anything on these old ones because i don't know when skyla is ever going to get a six star ex i will wait for the better one that will be a six star ex and then i'll spend all my sync orbs on that and everything below it is worthless and the game is not kind enough to how players want to play that you can use any pokemon that any pair that you like in there and expect to be able to get to the upper limits you just can't yeah my the reason i brought up the sync gird stuff is because my only maybe thought and i don't know i don't this is i like i don't have any inside scoop at dna i i just think that like because synchroids don't seem very user-friendly that maybe the reason they didn't roll it out to everyone is because they're reworking it which would probably be good because i don't think what we have now for sync grids is like the best thing to interact with yeah does red and charizard have syncred yeah oh yes yeah they have a full sink red oh i only think i have one red and charizard so i don't think i can see it yeah it's just okay so the other rest of the game before you add six stars fix the rest so another thing they're adding to the game uh which is part of me this will draw me in here this is i think this is cool a big update on august 27th is the champion stadium kanto challenge in the champions stadium you choose 15 sing pairs to take part on in five three on three battles once a sing pair is battled it cannot take part in any remaining battles the cancer challenge has you facing off against the elite four in the kanto league champion blue before you take on blue you must challenge the elite four in any order you wish so put some thought into how to assemble your sink pair for this gauntlet there are two difficulty levels normal is standard and hard will give an expert trainer extra challenge playing through the champion stadium will earn you items to raise your sink pairs to 6 star ex even if you're playing normal you do not miss out on rewards each week you will have an opportunity to play through the champions stadium in order to earn items just be aware that if you're playing on hard your opponent's pokemon and type weakness will change each week so you will have to consistently update and adapt your strategy this seems cool to me because i feel like you don't have a lot of incentive not to use skyla because she's so good so you're kind of forced into skyla has to be on one specific team and it gives you an incentive to level up other sink pairs and try to put them together and i do like that hard will be different every single week so that's cool it has the potential to be cool there's a couple of things that that make me go so one is there's obviously going to be a very set pattern to just get through the kanto league right like these are the think pairs that you're gonna need to have especially on the normal difficulty uh i'm concerned about the stamina cost of doing this because stamina is already quickly becoming a problem we can't spend any of this episode right it's just a problem it is a problem i will i will say that the team that i work with at dna which is the american team which does not make the decisions the japanese team does that's why there was two japanese guys in the video um they're they're very well aware type weaknesses changing each week is a nice thing for people who are struggling to find things to do it is definitely a money sink at that point because you are going to have to try to invest in 15 good sync pairs and hope that you have them and that is not a given especially for a lot of the really good ones are limited offer ones so you know i've pulled one sigma suit cynthia i will probably not pull another ever and i have no way of raising that right and so i think that's a problem that is happening in this game that a lot of these one-time things have gone away and they're not coming back anytime soon that we can see and so there's just a lot of there's a lot of spending resources in the game that it leads to a feeling of i don't feel great spending this because since i didn't get a max skyla i'm picking something lesser so that i can get through the game but the minute i can get skyla i'm switching right and that's not a great feeling in your game like there's you don't have such an abundance of resources that you feel like well it's okay that i leveled will up to max and did a whole sync grid because i have plenty for when i finally get enough for skyla yeah he's right now it's you know right now it's just like well i mean i guess i have no other choice it's kind of the same thing like you can get cyrus but you have to get all the good pulls to be able to level cyrus and if you don't get them cyrus is just stuck right because you could you can only use the palkia cans to level up pelcia and if you just don't get them then you're done like that pair is basically useless it's the zinnia problem it's all of the limited problems where you feel like here are the good ones that i want to use i don't get them so i either have to sink a lot of money into it and the money in this one is still really bad the deals are still very bad and there's still still a sense of i'm wasting my time on lower sync pairs and it would be interesting if the normal one also changed weaknesses so that people could not could raise a bunch of other ones that weren't top tier and you could play with your favorites but since it's expert difficulty you know that you can only use the top ones at the top of those charts and the six star makes this whole problem worse it's just a really weird decision it's just a really weird take that they're going on and they've become even stingier like as everybody feared they'd be gone back to being very stingy with the resources um and it it it creates a frustrating it creates a frustrating feedback loop of i want to play the game i like certain parts of this game but i'm forced to make really sub-optimal and poor decisions and it hurts because i don't know when i'm going to get these things again they fixed some of it with the sync orb grips and those things where you feel like you can get those resources but that's leading into the much larger we're not going to touch on that stamina problem feel like i'm missing a part of the announcement i also have the cynthia and como was there one other thing they announced the name change the name change cynthia coma oh elite four they said there would be there would be more elite yeah they'll they'll be doing the other reasons i kind of hope whatever point they don't go in order it'd be nice what are they going to do for johto oh shoto is very recycled it would be nice if they just maybe like i don't know did the gen 7 get that out of the way still fresh in people's memory maybe not go to the disappointing joto one off the bat which is literally the the same i still don't have any chinese eggs in this wait what is jojo's orders will bruno will koga no will bruno which is the same koga yeah which is not which is i mean you fought him as gym leader but now he's there so will's new and then karen right and then lance fight lansing is 18 dragonites for no yeah no good reason speaking of dragon sink bears cynthia encoma oh is the first of first part of the anniversary event it goes until september 3rd uh her cigna suit i think it looks great uh she's yeah i really like i really like her signature i like her little uh cut scene that she has that is really good i have i have cynthia sigma suit that's the only thing i managed to pull i have i don't have the other cynthia fyi not that i'm bitter oh i've you know three of those there if you go to pokemon masters official website there is a new sink pair coming on august 27th and there's another one coming on september 9th so i that people are assuming that's going to be signa suit blue signal suit green i i don't i don't i don't know i feel like every time people are like oh it's a new sick pair coming it has to be blue and green it never is so i'm not sure maybe deantha is also still not in the game when are they going to put deanthe in the game i mean she is in the game on the loading screen yes she is she's not she's not in the game oh you know you they did show some stuff we missed they showed that there is a lily gladion and um lusamine event going to be coming oh which i have such an issue with this what that sounds fun to me yeah that's awesome like you're making me the bad guy greg because i'm like excited for all these and you're like nope no no no no this none of that no no no just because you enjoy something and greg does not does not mean it's good or bad it's just that you're different people with different things you would enjoy here's my only issue what is the problem with the lily eventually that whole plot line was how horrible of a mother she was and they're like forced these two kids to reconnect with their abusive mom no no no no no she see a psychiatrist in kanto they retconned it in ultrasound ultramoon she wasn't abusive at all except for that except for that time she entirely was like there are so many other families you could pick that's not like hey make these kids deal with their bad mom and if you get them real good they'll all be friends again no thank you me look let's let's give masters credit where credit is due the silver storyline very good yes and that is something that the main series games didn't really touch on but the silver storyline was good so maybe the lilly storyline will just maybe address that and try to flesh that out a little bit more uh the cyrus stuff not great uh i'm cynthia was like we're going to arrest you and send you to jail or you need to change and cyrus was like i'll never change i'll never change i still want to destroy this world but i guess i'll play along so i don't go to jail thanks yeah the cyrus one not not great not real weird good it's just like also it's just it's very hard for me when people if people play pokemon for the story i i know they're out there i i see you i get it but there are better stories and much other like pokemon stories are nowhere near top of like moving pulling on my heart strings or or or whatnot and cyrus's character is is pretty i think i think silver is easier to write as a character because they're like young and you can be like well you're that it's like every every adult can relate to this like when i was a kid i was an idiot right yep so it's uh sorry no i can't i can't relate to that at all i've always been perfect so it's easy to like write a character that's like stubborn and and and and maybe a thief and had dad issues oh well definitely a thief and had daddy issues like silver did whereas like when you're writing a grown man who's like i want to crush the world and every time he gets magically teleported whether it's like rainbow rocket or this he's like is this the new world i am on a beach this is this looks very different i think i think this is ever oh it is cynthia you are wearing a different outfit i will crush you and she's like i'm going to send you to jail and he's like i still want to crush but i will join your team to crush the elite four like it's like they just don't know how to write cyrus because he's an adult and it just seems very silly well his entire worldview is like liking people as a weakness destroy the world you're imperfect how dare you come near me child and sophocles is like i have a wrote tom he does at one point go i like this i like this rotom it reminds me of rotom's it's like that whole plot line and i'm like i mean it was kind of bad that you were letting a mob boss on your team this guy is straight up a psychopath he has stated multiple times to everybody on this beach that he wants to blow up the world and he hasn't said okay no it's it's it's unreal actually i feel like they i'm i i wonder if there's like some profile like all these characters have like profiles in the pokemon company and they like pulled out cyrus and they're like all right what do we got for cyrus well he's dedicated and making sure the world starts over uh really loves space and time and has no empathy for anything all right likes rotom who are you going to pair them with sophocles hasn't done anything at all they're the same right they make things sophocles likes to build systems and cyrus wants to rebuild the universe yeah to cut out human emotions boy that lies in when they add lysander the game it's gonna be the same thing right oh my god well and you're all like oh no they're going to do a great job with lucid mean i'm like no they're deaf they're it's going to be like i'm completely apologetic that i tried to kill both my kids i spent some time in a coba how did i end up on this beach oh well kids don't you love your mom you have to love your mom to defeat the elite four i guess we'll love mom now yeah yeah maybe you're right i mean defeating the elite four is pretty a pretty important milestone in people's lives it is so okay last thing they talked about was that they got they received lots of feedback that people liked sync the cigna suit characters so they want to add more to the game and summer character and uh sorry event seasonal characters so people love the seasonal people love the cigna suit which actually doesn't surprise me because it's a game where you collect characters of course that is like i agree with those people like that's the thing i want to do i wanna i think cigna suit cynthia signa suit grimsley signa suit uh elisa i think there are they all look incredible they're all awesome yeah they look great and they said the next seasonal event will be in october and it will be a halloween event and so people are excited we've had two seasonal events since the game was launched one was the winter stuff and then the other was the summer stuff we just got so this will be the third one uh i thought the announcement was fine i think the ex name change is really weird i am a hundred percent sure maybe 99 sure the reason is because japan they there must be some obsession with like sticking ex at the end of things to make because japan has those huge machines that have like the slappy things it's i don't know if you've ever seen it they're at like pokemon centers yeah yeah there's like a slappy yeah there's like four of there's like four of them at every pokemon center they're these huge red looking arcade machines and you have like these little ex discs they're like little rectangles with a pokemon on it and then you slide it into the machine and it reads the pokemon and then there's just a giant red button that's all there is on this machine and you just slap that button and it's like pokemon go before pokemon go of just like hitting your finger the one button over and over in a raid battle and they change the name of that thing like every two years pokemon slap ex i i don't you get a high score okay look we'll have we'll have andrew explain it they could they change doesn't know they change these machines like every two years and they change the like shape of the rectangle slightly so you gotta buy more rectangles it's it's it's it's fascinating it's actually it was the worst i am i was hoping they were going to address the gem situation i think gems are still overpriced gems are way overpriced i still was hoping that they would say like hey we're changing it so when you do a 10-pole you're guaranteed at least two four stars like they didn't address that at all maybe they don't have to because they're making money i don't and oh this is another if they are going to release six stars then a guarantee me a four star at a ten pole just guarantee you one four star so i don't feel like i had for this last month 33 star polls in a row um they are they are giving 3 000 gems i think on august 27th that starts which is a 10 poll we i think that's all the masters news that's everything it was a big masters update sorry one year anniversary i mean it's a big thing to celebrate yeah and i will say this they have improved a lot about the game but some of these new choices have been scratching my head real hard like what don't slide back now come on i thought there would be a little bit more honestly yeah i mean they may i was like say oh they may be keeping things hidden but it's seven days away right yeah and i mean they can they've if we want to just touch on the stamina issue real quick they have definitely given out gems and given out apology stuff and have done that over the last year like hey this one bug that you didn't experience but one person out of the however many people played did here's three thousand gems sorry this we fixed it um so it's not like if something doesn't feel right or something they they also have said that the stamina system is technically a trial period and they are open to feedback you can submit that feedback through the app of what you like and what you don't like hopefully they're listening i'm sure i i know that i know they know the issue but whether they're gonna do something about it yeah it's very easy for them to give you know ten packs of stamina or gems or just straight up change it on the fly like they don't have to wait for a reason to change it it's a living game at this point they can change it when they want i would just like them to for the daily stuff at least one pack of skip tickets which i love skip tickets but they are giving out way too many i'm almost at 700 and they can't even use them is just have one of those be a hundred stamina refill would make stamina so much easier to deal with part of my daily amount was i got one of those packs of three skip tickets was just a 100 200 stamina refill we will take a break we got some vgc stuff to talk about and uh some pokemon detective pikachu stuff that has popped up so we will be right back no no no no do it right do it right i don't know what that means [Music] i stopped doing the we are back like six months ago now do it do it and we are back from our break and we are back back back and we are back from our break and we are back back back back we are back this is your last warning last warning for the kickstarter it ends on 28th i believe friday the 28th so if you are listening to this on monday or tuesday or wednesday you have a couple days left if you want to get in so kickstarter link in the show notes on the slack in the discord on the twitter i probably don't have to go into it too much as the fourth week and thank you to everyone who backed it's already funded so now's the time to get in because it's going to happen yeah it's guaranteed so you know don't worry about is being at vaporware uh we know how to find steve so that's true the pokemon company has announced a rule set for the upcoming vgc series six via pokemon home uh 16 frequently used pokemon will be illegal oh you will get arrested in an upcoming competitive tournament series 6 will go live on september 1st just to be clear because i actually forgot this series five and i believe series four both lasted like two months each so we've been in season five for a while now so this is series six even though this is the like ninth month of the game i think i mean it didn't say month six it's a series six yeah but when they started it was like once a month because they were like slowly introducing gigantomax pokemon then it got weird i want to say it was caesar season four was the first two month season and then season five was two months and i'm assuming c series six will take us to crown tundra probably um all of september all of october september october yeah so probably crown tundra and then series 7 will start so they uh this is what happened they took the top 10 pokemon in singles and they took the top 10 pokemon in doubles and then they just banned them um but there were over there there was overlap pokemon that are banned incineroar yup yeah that was it it was just incineroar no it was um yep hey i know my stuff yeah rilla boom togekiss cinderace incineroar yeah please indeedy both are banned for the record tyranitar whimsicott torkel dragapalt venusaur porygon2 mimikyu gyarados hippodon excadrill and magnazone so the paragon that they just gave me is banned yes porygon had to fall so dust claps could look they they did better than most tcg companies um let's not say watsy out loud make you pay for something and then ban it a month later okay but what did twerkle do torkle is really dominant in trick room teams and it helps venusaur and yeah it helps venusaur a ton and it helps it makes venusaur like the fastest pokemon in the world when when torquel's out so why are they doing this change up the meta keep it interesting and i honestly think no one would have played the players cup is happening now there were a lot of competitive people that walked away when all the tournaments were canceled for the year and i think if they would have just continued with the current rule set of season five no like no one would have played there's not a lot of like people playing now compared to you know before kovid i mean do you really think that's taking these out these 16 out will draw a bunch of people to the game yes no no no the the real thing okay uh steve might be a little bit correct because people love to complain and they're like every team is the same six pokemon it's rillaboom and cinderella together right and then they're like well yeah so you can't have those and so it's like now that every team's not gonna be those six is gonna be a different six but the real reason it's just gonna be a different six right yeah sure yeah i mean like yeah when you run meta's work yeah metas will always rise to the top but the real reason is did you notice on that list that there were no genies that were being banned that's the issue insufficient genies okay well they're not in the game yet well yeah somebody fixed that okay so you said yes this will bring people into the game into competitive support your claim support i've never i've never played vgc before ever and now they've banned 16 pokemon including all of the starters i don't think it brings new people in i think it brings people that are salty or frustrated with the meta back in and willing to try it again but it's just it just but doesn't it just create a different meta like is is the next the next pokemon after this so varied that you that you'll have a whole like 40 or 50 that you could see no no or is it see that no that's not the problem the problem is when you have a stagnant meta like all all metas will stagnate at some point because people will churn it out they'll figure out which is the best team and those those will be the best teams with small variations the problem is when a stagnant meta is in place for a year if you have the metas change up every two months people are interested because in that two months you're gonna that's when you're gonna develop the churn and everything then you play it out and then maybe towards the end of the two months that's when it becomes a little boring and it's like all these six dudes again but it's like if every two months you're changing it up so that it is a new rotation and there's a new thought process that that does keep it interesting and appealing uh a good example of how this works and i'll keep it within pokemon i could go destiny or fortnite or apex but within pokemon if you look at the pokemon trading card game you you can those metas last for three months and then a new set of cards get introduced some current metas get better some current decks and that meta get better some get worse you know dragopalt was a very good deck um before darkness ablaze and now because of eternitis and darkness ablaze which is the current set that just came out dragon pulse not really good anymore um but the problem in that meta is it there's money involved so if you don't if you can't afford to build eternitis then yes dragonfall is still good but you can have good metas and bad metas so i would argue that the dark explorers meta which both will and i played which i thought was extremely good dark cry was pretty dominant in that meta but there was still there were still ways to counter it and there was still enough variety between darkrai decks you could run darkrai with stabilize you could run darkheart with tarakion you could just run darkrai with apsil you could run darkride tarakion and sableye um and then you could just not run darkrai like you could run straight like there was a lot of variety i think in the dark explorer set and then what happened after that was the team plasma rotation started coming in i'm skipping around there was more sets in between but uh and then team plasma introduced hypnotoxic laser and um verbank jim and that was the meta like you everyone was running for hypnotax laser everyone was running verbank if you weren't running furbank you were running something to counter verbank but you still wanted to run hypnotoxic because you could take advantage of their burbank and it was just such a good card to run and that meta was bad and that meta was bad enough for me and a lot of other people to walk away from the competitive and so i think with the introduction of rillaboom uh the introduction of porygon2 back people probably walked away because like cinderella cirillo boom these these pokemon that just instantly became dominant when season five started are frustrating to deal with and there didn't really seem to be an excellent counter to those that wasn't just the default counter that people were using and dragopal has been annoying since day one uh togekiss has been annoying since day one venusaur got really good when venusaur was introduced uh but since then you know venusaur has you know been countered so i think you you remove these 16 pokemon 16 new pokemon rise to the top but the question is are those 16 pokemon going to stay dominant or is there going to be a variety of stuff that you can work with and is that going to be healthy or are people going to be like man i wish toga kiss was back or ah gosh nothing is working because whimsicott's not here and i think that's exciting and so yeah i guess that's that's my argument like the pokemon company's been doing this for 20 years with the the tcg uh and the fact that they really haven't done this with the the video game since sword and shield is well i guess they kinda did it with sun and moon with saying like megas are allowed this time but z moves are allowed this time but now you can get both i think it's exciting honestly i i definitely agree i think it's i mean the biggest complaint from the bgc community was that those meadows became stagnant and stayed stagnant for long long long periods of time so now they're they're these are real solutions for you know swapping up the meta and and making it something new for people to figure out which is what is like a huge appeal and interesting to folks yeah and i think the thing that's gonna happen starting season six is durant becomes number one i think durant rises to the top as the number one pokemon easily and then what will happen is people will probably run specific solutions to durant and then durant players will not be able to counter the solutions and they will stop running durant around four times a week to fire yeah yeah but what's out speeding durant at this point uh my trick room slow poke so like like i think the only thing that outspeeds durant is talonflame and you what do you do you like you follow me the talonflame attacks the follow me and then durant max rock falls on the talonflame and gg talonflame can't survive max rockfall are you sure that durian can learn rockfall yeah it can it can learn rockslide so that's max rockfall so the reason during rockslide now we got to start banning some movies that's what we've got to do i mean the the meta also got changed up when the move tutor stuff came out right like grassy glide wasn't a move two months ago and now people run grassy glide and the last two months were so dominated from rilla boom doing grassy glide that it was frustrating and there wasn't a real good counter to rilla boom which wasn't like in dd i think brave bird needs to become a priority move again and not have the restriction of 100 hp that's my campaign fix brave bird the reason i think durant becomes number one is because durant already came in durant i think already won a tournament before kovit and then came in second in another tournament durant's ability is hustle which is like increase moves by 20 but decrease accuracy by 20 and then durant's really fast durant has one weakness which is fire which is four times a week too but wait doesn't rockslide only have eighty percent accuracy but when you j when you dynamax your moves are a hundred percent accurate which means that wasn't in the manual which means which means which i really loved opening pokemon shield yesterday because i got a physical copy and there's nothing inside what a joke so durant does 20 more damage 20 percent less accurate or something like that but when you have three turns of 100 accuracy and you're already the fastest pokemon and you can max rockfall you can max steel spike you can max whatever the other two moves they teach durant they probably give it a life orb so it does another 20 so there's nothing i i think durant becomes number one for the next week or two after september 1st but you need probably arcanine goes up arcanine goes way up i'm trying to think of other fire pokemon i was going to say maybe cinderella but cinderella's got banned i don't think heatmore is good at all but i mean heatmore's eat durians this is yeah it should be an auto win really you know you said they're during on the field heat rain on the field it's just auto win at that point at that point right yeah no heat more not heatran you've got heatran on the mind man no i said heat more i heard heatran maybe i've got heat treatment hey remember when we said urshifu was built for competitive and it avoided the ban because it was like the 11th most played not the 10th most played yep sliding in i don't i must i i would take incentive roar over urshifu any day i would rather deal with incineroar than hershey food urshifu is so annoying tail and flame i think goes way way way up charizard probably goes up i mean is talon playing telephones very fast right yes i used to i used to have a team like my during mega evolution uh vgcs i my team was based around talonflame you know when brave bird was good but whatever can't go back in time i guess yeah talonflame outspeeds durant but like easy right easy tailwind durant's 109 talonflame's 129. um charizard does not outspeed durant but what can durant do to charizard max rockfall yeah max right you've got gigantomax charizard like i think that's a win still weak to rock type moves but yeah four times yeah charizard charizard and talonflame are both weak to both four times a week to rock fall rock moves and durant one durian one shots and if for some reason talonflame and charizard were running focus which they're not the sandstorm then kills if it doesn't one shot and all you need to pair with durant is follow me right so if you're like oh i'm just going to use a fire move against durant you just whatev literally anything can sit there and follow me and take the fire type move so durant doesn't so what happened to brave bird uh so they nerfed it where um the it wasn't the ability wasn't it it wasn't the move no big pecks was the ability oh i don't know they nerfed brave birds so you had to be at 100 health no it wasn't it's it's a no no no no no it's ability gail wings gave it priority scaling they always gave that's the one priority i'm an old man it's like i've seen people use brave bird way lower than they've knocked themselves out so okay so this is what happened so in generation six when talonflame was introduced gail wings the ability gave priority to any flying type move and then in generation seven gale wings only works when the user is at full hp do you get one shot so what people did since gen 7 is they tailwind on turn one because they're guaranteed to go first because tailwind is a flying type move and because tailwind is then set up because the gale wings you're going to win the speed battle after that so i i do think that talonflame is going to go super super up but i don't know what the i don't know what the know what the easy solution against durant is unless you taunt the person who's going to use follow me but i think follow me has priority over taunt so that doesn't work what if i have a prankster sableye i think follow me is plus two priority right taunt is only plus one is it look i don't know where okay yes where does it say follow me is plus two taunt is plus zero and well let me say the real name of the move is follow the finger because that's the name of your japanese and that's a much better name yeah dust claps probably should have been banned it was so dominant the first couple seasons and then porygon 2 came out and then poor gun 2 was better than dusk claps but porygon 2 suffered the ban instead which is pr probably i don't know probably better but dust klopp's will is back um hershey foo is still good arcanine will probably go way up uh the swords of justice are probably going to go way up to rakian and kobat kobelian specifically no one uses varisian dracovish avoided the ban grim snarl avoided the ban poly rain teams go super super up uh rain rain unfortunately was not dominant people thought because polly toad was returning with the isle of armor that we would see a lot of rain teams because polly polytoad is a way better rain setter than peliper was uh zumerel with huge power came through the olive armor but because of the dominance of rilaboom we didn't really see rain teams so we'll probably see a lot of rain teams in season six i'm assuming uh doraledon not banned so that's safe uh corvo knight probably goes way way way way up corverne has a really good showing with the players cup this this past weekend so carver knight is probably going to be fine um i'm assuming colossal is still safe gothitel was pretty we used quite often in the first couple seasons um so i would probably see gothel returning my boy gastrodon still safe uh comfey has been seeing a lot of play so i would assume that comfey goes way way up as well mudsdale safe mods yeah mozdale is mudsville very dominant season one two and three and it was when season four came which was gigantomax lapras where mudsdale went from like five percent usage to less than one percent usage oh i've got a shiny one of those naturally caught in the wild so i think it's exciting uh well i guess we'll see no no more really boom no more dragopaltin almost cinderease so no more super luck togekiss well until season seven or series seven yeah the other thing the the other actual takeaway here is that a lot of competitive players were worried about the forces of nature returning that is your thundurus your tornadoes your landorus bringing back the genies they they have they're not genies they uh they don't grant wishes not all genies great wishes i know rude they were very dominant they've always been dominant all all three of those i think both thundurus and tornados have prankster and landorus has intimidate so the fact that they ban these pokemon means that if the forces of nature become dominant when the crown tundra comes out which we know they're coming in crown tundra as well as the tapus we know the tapies are coming because they were in the trailer as well they could be banned in future seasons uh which will probably be the case because i don't see how landorus doesn't make it top 10 uh once it comes back so that's good that's better than it's almost like at e3 when they stood on stage and they said the reason we cut pokemon was for a better competitive meta and everyone on reddit who has no clue how competitive works threw their arms up in the air and pointed at g-max dreadnough which has a less than 0.5 use rate it's almost like they've had dreadnought for the record is 0.02 percent use rate sad it's almost like they weren't lying to us that there was has been a pretty healthy meta in the vgc for the last nine months and it's nice that it's changed so often and they've introduced new pokemon and they've now removed pokemon that have dominated so uh i'm excited i think my mudsdale will be good again okay two more news pieces of news this is off silicon era pokemon lead interface designer wants your feedback that title is a little misleading dave gibson who works at creatures not game freak uh it's creatures incorporated thank you thank you [Music] they tweeted what ui ux mistakes drive you absolutely mad in pokemon games i want to ship the next game with a top-end experience and your feedback is invaluable so they tweeted this so a couple things one they work at creatures not game freak number two in their actual twitter bio they say they're working on detective pikachu [Laughter] so i am sure they were bombarded with tons of things unrelated to the two uh i'm not saying that you can't say to them like hey specifically in sword and shield i hated that the x button did this or whatever because the ui and ux so that's user interface so that's what's the ux for hotshot the x is the user experience thank you very much so this is how a person interacts with the menus and the actual game not specifically mechanics like so being like man i wish toga kiss super luck wasn't at 30 like that's not what they're nothing to do with abilities it's just like how you interact with the product so a really good user interface or user experience problem would be i'm playing sword and shield i went to pokemon home they both have pc boxes why are the buttons different that is i i knew that is exactly where you were going that's like i knew that was number one and then number two is gonna be i hate the noises that the menus make when you press the buttons that there's like a screeching noise that's not well i guess that's an experience but i can't i can just mute that okay if your solution to a user experience problem is to modify the outputs of the system then that's a a problem that needs to be solved yeah i mean i still think that the home and pokemon sword and shield should have the same buttons oh you're the only person who has this great greg back me up i don't want to but you're right they should you should pay attention to what's happening on the screen and not just assume that every button press is gonna be the same across platforms yeah but they they teach you how to do it and then they're like or nah it's just they could make it better it doesn't have to be that way i will i will give that to you yes i mean you know i don't want to say yes but i have no choice i think the actual news story here isn't specifically like like i i don't actually care the ant what the answers are that people are given this dude i think the cool i think the cool thing here is one we found somebody who has admitted they're working on detective pikachu a game yeah a game we haven't heard about in in what a year now yeah i mean it's been a while and two we have found somebody who works at creatures this has been like the mystery person like we we know like a handful of people that work at game freak we don't know we know game freak has like 200 employees we know like five of them uh one being james turner one being masuda one being i can't remember the other ones but we we found a an english speaking employee at creatures working on detective pikachu which that's not the surprise we know that creatures was the one that made detective pikachu for the 3ds so we kind of just assumed that they were making detective pikachu for the switch so i think that in itself is is news uh i i wouldn't be surprised if this tweet gets deleted in the future because the pokemon company is real weird about that kind of stuff uh but silicon era said they scanned the tweets the things that popped up the most was sword and shield players were want touchscreen controls for menus when the switch is in handheld mode um other players including to include improve sorting storage connecting with online friends when i looked at the the thread it was a lot of people complaining about the wycom yeah i mean that's valid some people were suggesting the series should do a sin shin megami tensai with the ui within the world i don't specifically know what that means um i know it's related to persona but i don't know say it again uh they just said that they would like the ui to be more shin megami tensai oh more like that okay i don't know well enough just yeah i've never really played those games i played persona but i don't know if that's different than which persona did you play the one on the the four the five the whatever the newest one was with the masks yes with the masks yeah yeah i never played that one i've never played a persona game oh you're missing out dude i know stuff there's some stuff final bit of news here sent in from kevin from our slack community is vaporeon is that build-a-bear yep you know you got to end with a strong note here when you and i went to build a bear it was there was no vaporeon but there was a snubble uh-huh yeah yeah was there an eeveelution yeah there was a jolteon oh that's right because then you made fun of jolteon well okay look i'm always on jolteon watch and here's the news people uh steve did not make me uh build anything it's true so we we went in we looked and we went out it was covered we had to we had to move quickly the germs are going to catch you once all right greg give us our question of the week now's the point in the podcast when we will answer a question asked and it's time time time for the question of the question of the week is that country johnny cash oh which johnny cash ring of fire good job down down fire yeah okay uh this is from haley in our slack community they ask which ise break music song is your favorite it's almost like we have a kickstarter going on that ends this week i am very partial to glory to america north america makes me laugh every time yeah but you you have the visual to go with it absolutely you've got it i i was there for the reality and i was there i also like pumpkin spice only because i was thinking about it because i was in the grocery store last weekend and all the pumpkin spices cereal is back oh man halloween candy is already i know um and i like uh i also really like who's your favorite pokemon yeah oh that is my least favorite i'm so tired of hearing that ugh who's your favorite pokemon always works well when we have like a guest on because there's two of them you can run part one before part two after much like you recently did with the uh yeah interview yeah um ah boy what is my favorite i mean i i would say like if i had the opportunity to remaster do one over it would be the katamari cast one yeah because it's just like the the the tempo was off um and i'd like to i'd like to see that fixed i mean i love brussels sprouts is good brussels sprouts is good yeah brussels sprouts is good i what is the one that's like i remember it came out when i was in hawaii and it was like where the lock this way no no no no no no no uh it's like it was like it should be a zap or something oh the the i think it's bop bop is what it's called something like that yeah making a beep yeah yeah and i like making a beep is good uh but i don't know if that one's called the the the classic original button done dance is you know it's hard to beat that one yeah that one's all right now bop bop is different pop-pop is where greg goes making a beef is different but they're both good oh i forget even why we were talking about the beep who put the beep up the beep was uh rochelle yeah i know but it wasn't it was in reference to something specific i don't know oh no it was like they were advertising something and yeah they like just could have chosen better words i'm also uh i really like uh exclusive which was will saying exclusive in the microsoft hit the microsoft voice that one always i don't know it gets a chuckle out of me uh like tubes is a classic as well i'm actually really excited for this album well pokemon of the week all right so last week's pokemon um what i didn't say in the clues and everything uh is known as the poor man's gastrodon or aka why aren't you using gastrodocs why is she using gasoline yes it was my pokemon named tickles from the 2012 u.s nationals vgc competition uh it knows fischer which is a one hit knockout move but it only has like a 25 accuracy so nobody ever uses it because you're gonna lose uh also knows aqua tail earthquake and future site and future site has the ability anticipation which it's like one of the few non-psychic types that has that ability and thank you i didn't look up the twitter somebody wrote me on twitter about why this particular pokemon has like the anticipation and the earthquake and fisher and everything oh yeah there's there's reasons if you look at some japanese lore and history um and uh smogon um i read a little piece off smogon about how basically it's awful even in the lowest usage of pu [Music] bar boat go go further go deeper does not have a w on its it's not a head evolved pokemon i had to say the wrong pokemon i knew what it was yeah i mean you were there so i mean so are those w's on its side like on the barbouche it's like the charlie brown symbol ah like his shirt yeah and it just becomes the w for win and i'm going to say it now whiz cash has maybe the best pokemon shuffle icon does it really of all time i love it so much is it like a derpy face it's so cute it's just smiling straight at you the thing is whiskash it's like it's a great poke i mean for a water type pokemon it is a great pokemon and yet it just gets like short changed in every possible way yeah no gas are done well i mean yes it's no gastrodon but you know the nice thing you don't have to worry about which side of hoe when you go sinnoh you got it from look at that shiny dude look at that shiny that is glorious it is a good shiny too great shuffle good shiny no trivia no trivia at all that's not right that can't be wishcast is based on namazu a catfish and japanese mythology that causes earthquakes uh i like wish cash okay so the other thing uh is that um not only do they think that uh catfish can caught or they had the thing about catfish causing earthquakes there was also a time where they felt that catfish could predict earthquakes so that's why it has anticipation and uh future site so that it can like see into the future future can we just stop for a minute and say how dumb of a move future site is it does no damage until like what two turns later yeah accurate it's not great but if you predict it and they forget when it's true you know so confident in your future sight there you go all right this week's pokemon of the week has no shuffle icon or shiny because it's not a pokemon we're taking a break from the pokemon for a minute here we go and also steve if i say uh redo that edit that part out oh okay sure like why can't i why do i have to sound bad all right wait did you do that last week yes because i said it's i i started out and i said uh as we have now reached my personal eighth anniversary and then i'm like that should be eighth let me start over and as we have now reached my personal eight and you just left it in yeah yeah usually yeah it's down there in the lower paragraphs but it's in there don't you worry make him will look bad on a weekly basis all right here we go non-pokemon pokemon of the week okay if you are planning on taking up mountain biking as a hobby be prepared to learn quite a few things we learned so much about your life in these things i do my best one mountain bikes specifically full suspension mountain bikes are incredibly expensive number two there are multiple variations on mountain biking cross country enduro downhill free ride trail and others three you need a lot of protective gear and you're still going to get hurt in hoenn bikes played a particularly important role for the progression of the game requiring mastery of two types of bikes to access certain portions of the map the mock bike which has the greatest similarity to a road or gravel bike is the faster of the two bikes and allows you to go up muddy slopes or cross cracked tiles without falling through personally i was never able to master the mock bike and had someone else complete sky pillar for me as my dexterity was insufficient this week's non-pokemon item is the other bike the one that is most similar to a mountain bike you are able to perform tricks with this bike including wheelies and bunny hops one of the most useful features of this bike is the ability to bunny hop in one place which attracts the attention of wild pokemon without incrementing your step count there you go it's either easy or hard depends on your life experiences folks uh what uh will when i eventually get into minnesota when my wife finds a job there we move we should get those uh boosted skateboards no what i have a skateboard skateboard and that's good enough yeah but that's for like tricks and showing off i'm i'm talking we we need we need one to move like we need to get from point a to point b we will go to eric's bikes and boards and we'll get long boards and push them with our feet just like we did in the old days i love how i'm here and not a part of this plan greg you ain't going on no skateboarding there's no way you're getting on a skateboard i know your knees i feel like greg you're more of a roller skate kind of guy not a skateboard kind of guy i don't know how to skate yeah i had a skateboard as a kid oh we all did we all did not me i was never allowed to have a skateboard as a kid which is why i have a double fixing my knee right now it is perfectly taped but it's not perfectly safe it is taped up and held into position i am working on it we're going to go out to the eagan skate park greg okay we'll do uh a couple of rail rail slides i'm i'm 50 years old well why don't you want in or you want in look oh i wrote about the one wheel i i i might be down for a while i could maybe do a one wheel i mean if alan gerding can do a one wheel i think we can all do it we can all just that's that is the statement of the century valid all right uh kickstarter till the end of the week pay for my one wheel um the kickstarter money is not going to anyone's one wheel i have just reminding there's youtube content every monday wednesday friday i've invested a lot of the money into the youtube so if you need something to watch at work or something in the evening or something on the weekend and you don't want to watch the twitch streams which we also do five times a week twitch.tv slash pkmencast you want to see the best of the twitch like oh there's a lot of six hours of content something in that six hours has to be good every day and we take the the small bits of goodness from the the the twitch stream we highly edit it we put it on youtube i think it's good i i think that my editor does a great job um i agree when mondays are the podcasts wednesdays and fridays are the youtube stuff pokemon masters tcg pokemon go sword and shield it's everything you'd want the only thing we're missing is our cafe mix none of that yet but maybe one day yeah i mean greg and i have played cafe max are you guys still applying cafe mix i am not yeah all right then look master's got a bunch of stuff dragalia lost added a bunch of stuff final fantasy has a patch i have to write a book i have to work i got a whole bunch of stuff going on right now i wish i had as many excuses as greg but primarily i dropped my phone in the bathroom and that was enough to crack the screen and it's real hard to play cafe mix with a cracked screen oh no that's what you get for having expensive bathroom floor you gotta get the cheap bathroom floor doesn't break your phone that bounces when you drop something instagram twitter youtube twitch all the same pkmncast uh we have a subreddit uh 1300 people on it r super effective all of these links in the show notes if you cannot remember them although i will probably try to change the subreddits match i haven't done that yet i
