[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 270 third episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SBJ and with me today I have will yes and Pokemon go is ruining my life so I'm gonna have to retire retire from Pokemon go or retire from work to play pokemon get all of it I'm going to retire from society and go live in a cave where no Pokemon can come and find me okay Travis is also here not living in a cave I'm gonna try something new this week and that's don't announce a new podcast at the end of the episode cuz gosh I have too many now alright well hold you to that you might change your mind midway through yeah hey hey guys I just got a deal I'm starting a new podcast it's about looks around the room keyboards alright I don't think that markets been taken I think you could dominate that market it's the it's the Moog cast like moogles luka cast Moog it's a famous brand of keyboard chord oh yes okay Korg it's the Korg carats you're thinking the instrument I was doing a joke about looking at what's in front of me in a computer keyboard mmm podcast will you say a random ambiguous word and then find out what people actually thought you were talking about we got a show we got a show for you guys today we've spoken my news regarding the mostly Pokemon go but we have some recap of the VGC and the TCG us international championships I don't I think that's what they call it now something like that and then we have some emails and our Pokemon of the week so that's gonna be our show there was quite a bunch of Twitter and slack replies regarding to the lieutenant surge thing this consensus seems to be that one of the NPC's in the gym tells you that the second switch is always next to the switch that's incorrect the consensus is jackiebrown is actually quentin tarantino's best film but we all agree with Travis that Quentin Tarantino is an overrated director I've kind of forgotten about Jackie Brown when I was saying what ones I like because it's so not Tarantino there you go the exception that proves the rule I like Jackie Brown good let's jump into some Pokemon news first bit of news here is off Bulbul pedia mu movie 20 Pokemon codes to be available at 7-eleven in Japan zero codes to attain Mew and three Pokemon owned by the trainers from Pokemon the movie 2000 I choose you are available at 7-eleven source in Japan currently these codes can be redeemed in Pokemon Sun and Moon this mean will be level 50 and the original trainer will be xx star you can also get ash's charizard at level 42 juries Lucario at level 40 and Mikado's Piplup at level 30 I wonder if that's spoiler for the movie if we're gonna see you carry on Piplup I think they were in the trailer okay to obtain these codes players need to go to the 7-eleven store collect the virtual stamps using seven spots in the respective events durations players can obtain one stamp per store per day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. if a player has two stamps they can obtain a code for a pok√©mon each serial code requires a player to collect two stamps so they will need eight stamps to obtain all four Pokemon and in other news you get Soylent at 7-eleven in California that statement is the most uninteresting thing I just don't I don't have anything to say you can buy a grey paste that tastes like nothing and like in Sep this the most but I can't imagine a more boring statement I don't know how to make this funny I'm sorry happy birthday Pokemon trainers it's hard to believe that Pokemon go launched oh this is often the antics blog by the way hard to believe Pokemon go launched a year ago when amazing year spin since joining us last July you've demonstrated the true power of Pokemon go in augmented reality gaming by searching for Pokemon in the real world

went outside and to battle in the revamped gym and participate in raid battles with family and friends for the first time but this was only a beginning of the of an action-packed couple of months the celebration continues with a special Pikachu wearing a familiar hat appearing all over the world from July 6 to July 24th Pikachu discovered in the wild will be wearing Ash's famous hat from the Pokemon animated series so make sure you don't miss out on your opportunity to catch one you will also be able to stock up for ray battles and events with a special limited time anniversary box that will include incubators max revives ultra balls and raid passes at a discount in the in-game shop stay tuned for more exciting news over the coming weeks including additional information on Pokemon go Fest this July and events hosted at select uni-ball run amok o locations this August and September in Europe and Pokemon go events at the Pikachu outbreak in Yokohama Japan this August sincerely the Pokemon go team ah so there's a bit of news to go with this but the ash hat Pikachu I think is a nice touch yeah I haven't seen any of those I saw your drama about the whatever it was like the shadow or whatever and the then it turned out to be an asshat Pikachu or a Pikachu wearing an ash hat something yeah but several hours later well you saw I retreated the Pokemon go account where they said they were having problems with launching their event yeah i retweeted that too so the Pikachu hat the hat Pikachu should have went live at 3 p.m. Central Time so when I so when they tweeted that it was I think around 4 p.m. Central time that hey we're having issues with ash hat Pikachu so I didn't leave work until 6 and I can see three gyms for my work and one of them had an open spot for mystic so I left work to go to that gym it's like 6 o'clock so I go over to the gym I put a Pokemon there and then I pull from that gym I can see another for more gyms so I pulled up my so I looked around to see if there was any more gyms I'm to the point now where I don't care too much about battling like I like it I think it's better than the old gym system but I'm not gonna sit there solo and battle 6 Pokemon just to put one Pokemon there like if I'm gonna battle at a gym that helped Pokemon go works though you're like oh there's a there's a gym next to me where I can put a Pokemon and then you do it and by the time you get there then you see the 12 other pokey stops that no I'll just go there they're just a block away oh yeah and you get there you realize oh there's like 20 gyms just around the corner and all of a sudden you're in like you're in like you're in like two towns over yeah that's that's totally accurate and happens to me quite frequently I when I was looking at the other gyms to see if their response back at my work I saw the silhouette of Pikachu and I already have Pikachu I have a lot of Pokemon if you play pokemon go and you see a silhouette that means you don't have it so I was assuming oh that must be Ash hat Pikachu since I have Pichu I have Pichu I have right you so I drove back over to my work and I encountered it and it was just a regular Pikachu and I thought to myself that's a bummer and that also doesn't make sense of why it was a silhouette and some people on Twitter was like oh well maybe it was a Ditto but that doesn't Nelson that doesn't make sense one because ditto is usually riot at or Pidgey and - I have ditto so that still doesn't make sense so I said I caught the Pikachu and went on my way because why would I not catch a Pikachu they want you to catch like 200 Pikachu's or something for that Pikachu catch her mettle so I went home and then I checked the stats of the Pikachu just because I was looking to see if it was breathtaking or not and it wasn't then Micha texted me later that night he texted me around 10 p.m. and said hey I haven't caught any asshat pikachu's you want to go out tonight I said sure and I looked at I went through that is so romantic Wow I wish a guy would ask me out like that so it was a beautiful text message conversation I went back through my Pokemon and I noticed that that Pikachu I caught earlier became an asshat eat you so everything was right in the world and then we went out and we caught more ash happy juice so the thing here that I did notice and I could be wrong I'm not wrong often as we've learned from this podcast but I remember during the santahat Pikachu and the birthday had Pichu that there was a possibility that not all Pikachu's had hats from what I remember for Ash hat Pikachu ah it's the opposite I haven't found a Pikachu without a half so I don't know if that's true enough I haven't seen any Pikachu's here at all the current Washington DC nearby report is a murkrow sunkern real excited for that one more sun curtain to get sunflora it's been a rack magic cart spinarak murkrow hoot-hoot and summoner and come visit me so you got we got sunkern out the wazoo running out there to get those I'm also like 50 candies away from Gyarados oh yeah I got mountains all over the place here and there's Matt always Magikarp in the fountains one of the gyms that I can see from my house has a Magikarp as the one that's on top of the gym whatever title you go that's fun it's at the children's playground that's cool it's sort of like a Magikarp jump crossover I can I can get behind that there was a and then there there's three raids going on around me right now I would love if at my house I could see gyms going on but I can't hey man that is so cool was I have a better story it's not really that great of a story I went to my local mall there was not only a mr. mime in the gym which is exclusive to Europe but there was also a king scan in the gym which is exclusive towards Australia and I thought that was kind of cool I mean I've also seen gyms where all the gyms are different Eevee's and I've seen gyms where it's nothing but birds I saw a gym that was like a Noctowl and as a two and a Pidgey so I think that's fun because it's a sky battle gym I think that's that's fun because if you really wanted to take out a gym it doesn't matter what the CP values in the gym are whether it's the gym is 1500 CP or 2,800 CP it's still doable just solo that gym if you're if you're around like level 20 25 26 you can still solo the gym it might take you a while and you might go through a lot of potions and revise to do it but it's still obtainable so I do think it's fun that people are putting unique not unique but different Pokemon it's not every gym as Chauncey Snorlax Gyarados ride on I mean you do still see some of that but it is really fun I think to see oh look cool mr. mime is in this gym or Ampharos is in this gym I haven't seen Ampharos yet or kangaskhan or something like that so the West Michigan middle of no airport the nearby you got a Spiro Yetta loop something else just popped up a Spiro Alethia a merrill and then just a picture where the model hasn't loaded in Oh a knitter am male or female male yeah I got I got in a door and mail every day on my walk iris have we talked on the show like what does a knitter an supposed to be huh like is it not like a rabbit yeah but then like what it but then what are like knit Oh king and queen then cuz like big rabbit they sure aren't bunnies where is there they're like rabbits that turn into dinosaurs I don't get it is there a creature in withou mythology because you know how horses have horns and then their unicorns and whales have horns and then their NAR whales you're asking if knitter an is a Jackalope oh yeah but I don't is that that could be right no I don't think it's a Jackalope because Jackalope aren't Jackalopes a very uniquely like a North American mythical creature yes I want a Jackalope Pokemon now I'm gonna pull up Bobo pedia here I already did ain't nothing there no answers it's a mix of a porcupine a rabbit Mouse and hamster that's a real stretch right there quite an amalgam toss that all in the blender you get those white boys a knife it's just like you mix that number of things together you're probably gonna get something gross Burnie no King it says that neato King shares traits with a rhinoceros a gorilla a rabbit and a porcupine where's the gorilla in that mix maybe the arms it's like broad shoulders I think that's much of a stretch well that was your mini Pokemon the week let's talk about the poke by runefest in Grant Park here we have a couple more details these are bullet points they could or could not be accurate but I'll just run run through them real quick this off the Chicago Tribune permit says the application says 15,000 to 20,000 attendees are expected to be at the event which is planned for Grant Park Butler Field and the neighbor neighboring North Rose Garden a spokesman for the Attic declined to comment on the number of attendees each team lounge will have several 60-inch TV monitors and each will be accompanied by a team gym a site where players can compete against other pokemon the Petrillo music shell will serve as an invent main stage and will feature unquote ultimate gym we'd stop there and say this is this is where they're going to have you to write and they're gonna deliver on the promise of the announcement trailer yeah the CEO of an antic already said we're going to get Legendary's this summer there are 4 5 well 5 5 Legendary's in generation 1 mu mu 2 Zapdos Articuno Moltres I would find it odd that they would do more than one I feel like this event is a here's your one legendary and if they're going to pick one legendary I would assume it has to be Mewtwo because it would be really odd if they just picked like Articuno for some reason and then people on Team valor and people on Team instinct would be kind of upset that is not whatever it were mu yeah I guess it could be mu but I or the legendary Pokemon arcanine we told you was gonna be a legendary summer here's the legendary Pokemon are right or you know all of the or it could be any gen 2 legendary as well that's true because they have released the gen 2 pokemons hmm I mean I imagine it's gonna be like something really big you to I feel like is the talking point though you're probably right I'm just playing the devil's advocate a little bit I'm not sure what you mean by talking point I would say if you only know generation 1 Pokemon I guarantee out of all the pokemon names you heard which is probably Charizard Pikachu Meowth squirtle Mewtwo is in that conversation and nobody's seen Mewtwo yet so organizers have requested Jackson Drive which runs between Butler Field and the North Rose Garden to be closed between Columbus and lakeshore drives the map shows Jackson being the home to the events foodcourt although our organizers have received permission to sell alcohol the Niantic spokesperson said it will not be sold at the event clusters of Wi-Fi hotspots will be scattered around the park important because the game requires constant internet access to function will you got anything to comment on your Wi-Fi solution isn't isn't that exactly what I said was going to hell yeah yeah that's why the why they just proved me right I did they did this is probably the most in fact on here so turn up your radio a total of 66 portable restrooms are shown on the site map not 65 now 67 66 portable restrooms wait wait wait wait wait wait wait 66 porta potties let's use the name that people are gonna recognize they're not there's none that no rest nor room nor room in any of these things I have no idea see how you're going to survive I'm sure you'll find like a Starbucks or something anyways 66 for 12,000 people 15,000 people yeah we're 15 to 20,000 people here's here's a tip I found on reddit which I might actually take there is the this is gonna be bad I cannot bring a coffee can a classic Maxwell House coffee can with the plastic lid for me what pokemon go fest is right next to the Chicago Art Museum and I knew it was gonna be bad I think I heard guys how many like sweaty pokey man's are gonna be walking into the art museum like hey I don't care about your art but can i no no incorrect incorrect because unlike the Smithsonian museums of Washington DC did you know the rest of the country charge people to go in to museums yes yeah how cheap is that I liver is free art is for the people I trusted most museums you can use the restroom for free well no no the same way they'll use in the Gift Shop for free uh-huh Steve's gonna buy a day pass for the art means it was yeah that's gonna go into the glorious clean bathroom with all them Pokemon go cheapies who already spent $400 on a ticket to go stand in Grant Park and get a sunburn aren't gonna spend 10 more dollars to go and pee in the art meet ya gonna buy a pass for the this is the worst thing that's ever happened on this show how is this bad I will tell you how this I'm putting money in the economy no it's not it's not the utilitarian effect of your actions it's the like deontological like uh-uh if the intent that matters here like you you care so much more about Pokemon than this art that the old like that you're going to pay money to the Art Museum just to use the bathroom because the other crap happening over so much no no no no this is incorrect Pokemon is completely incidental to this Steve cares about a clean bathroom and a place to wash his guns more more than anything anything I am more than shocked Beauty the art the art will exist whether he pays for it or not I am shocked that Steve will use a rest stop on the side of the highway and not like some people I know find a hotel that is near the highway to use their restrooms to find the Platonic ideal of a sink there is something comforting using a clean master yet no one is denying that no one is saying like I'm not over here saying like you know what I love dirty bathroom like know what I'm saying that but what we know what I love dirty bathrooms because you know what they're not crowded get right in Oh all I'm saying your dedication to a way to like spotless porcelain is unfathomable you're telling me that if you had a choice between a porta potti that has been sitting in the Sun all day cooking whatever's in there 10 to 15 dollars and pay $5 for a bullet yeah I would I would tote we prefer like not having to pay to do the thing my body needs to do without my permission let me give hey to just be a slave to my own body's requirements but let me give you a different perspective I want each of you to run a marathon though has no I'm mad know what you'll find out is what a beautiful golden holy monument the port-a-john is it's there when you quit sidetrack do all marathon runners already know we're talking we're talking about how important the bathroom situation in Pokemon go is which is important do all marathon runners have a bathroom problem or is it just like 50% of them no okay no no no if you make one took a long time to finish right yeah but like I could hold I could not use a lot of water I cannot go to the bathroom for eight hours if I was like but not when you're running a marathon like interesting all this water but here's the thing if you plan properly you can do the whole marathon without going to the bathroom guess what hey number one life hack tip for all you kids out there the mo diem is not a banned drug for athletes so you can fend shut it down couple of hours before and here you know what I recommend Pokemon go fest maybe indulge so that's going way beyond baby or cell is an art museum toilet I'm just saying and this is not any issue that I've had cuz I plan right for the marathon so that's not an issue but as can we do a service community are there other locations besides the art museum that people might be able to target we can we can address that next week else do some scope it out and I'll get people the details next week hope mango fest organizers requested and receive permission to have inflatable inflatables on site what they might be is unclear but a Pikachu photo app is on the map near the petrel music shell assuming it's gonna be a giant blow-up Pikachu they bring it everywhere organizers didn't request permission to install any kinds of rides lifts or climbing walls nor petting zoos or pyrotechnics all checkboxes on the Park District's permit application so there you go no no climbing walls here's the question have they have they applied for permission to put pokey stops in that Park because I know if it was Milwaukee they get into a lot of trouble um I don't know but I do know what I do know is pretty sure the city of Chicago knows what's gonna go down like I don't think anyone is gonna be inside I'm pretty I'm also sure that I'm pretty sure the city of Chicago is loving this because of how much revenue they're going to bring to this area I do know though that on the same day the Hat Pikachu started I noticed a new gym near my work and I saw on Twitter and in slack that people were saying new pocus tops and gyms were were in area as they visited frequently so maybe these these stops have already been added or maybe I'm well obviously nee antic has the ability to add or remove stops instantly so there is a a map of where stops are going to be and it looks like there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 stops in the reserved area not including gyms the fact that's that's not 100% final the last bullet point is the Park District permit cost organizers $50,000 according to the application details about the event could change but the permission dates was established in March and was last modified on June 14th $50,000 for this event I think the upsetting thing for Pokemon go players this week was the Pokemon go anniversary event box for the anniversary we got the hat hat at Pikachu and there are some people that like that and some people that don't I'm in the I'm in the camp that I like this because it lets you find a Pokemon in the wild that you don't have and it just happens to be Pikachu but regardless of what pokemon it is if they ever did like a swirl with glasses or a crystal onyx only a couple people might get that reference if their all-time anime watchers to me that's still exciting because I still get excited when I discover a Pokemon I don't have and that's pretty rare at this point because most of the Pokemon I need are Pokemon that you can't find in the wild like blossom or porygon - so to stumble upon a Pokemon and go oh I don't have that that's what I've been looking for it just happens to be Pikachu with a hat I'm down with that I think a lot of people forgot that we just got a gym revamp and we just got raids two weeks ago and that was a start to this anniversary when you see people going well this is a really lame anniversary event you can't just look at Ash hat Pikachu it's it's more than that now if we're gonna talk disappointing I will agree and I will be an advocate for how disappointing this sale boxes as somebody who is very comfortable with spending money in Pokemon go or other games because I'm an adult with a job and I don't mind spending money if it gets me some kind of enjoyment the box they're selling is 12,000 pokey coins or sorry 1200 pokey coins would be one expensive box twelve dollars in in US money it includes six egg incubators two premium raid passes six mac max revives and 20 ultra balls what you can actually buy from this separately is a premium rate pass they're a hundred coins each so they're a dollar you get two of these in the box so we're two dollars six egg incubators this is something that I planned on buying quite a bit of before Pokemon go fest because at Pokemon go fest and I think in other areas they haven't exactly said they did say that they will be giving out special 2k eggs throughout the day that can hatch who knows what I'm hoping that those hatched like the hair are crosses and the corsa lows and the far fetches and all the Pokemon not available in the United States that's that's my hope at least those egg incubators are a hundred 150 Pokemon coins so dollar fifty they're giving you six of those so that's nine dollars so we're up to eleven dollars here they're giving you six max revives which I think everyone would agree probably the most worthless item in the box it's a hundred and eighty coins so dollar eighty and they're giving you 20 ultra balls which is unbelievable for a dollar a dollar or a hundred pokeballs for four dollars and sixty cents either way if you do all the math this box adds up if you were to buy it without the sale to twelve hundred and eighty poker coins so the sale the quote-unquote sale is 80 cents off plus twenty ultra balls and that's not much of a sale with a bunch of other stuff like you probably don't even need like the revives right yeah you don't need the revives the premium rate passes are nice the egg incubators are nice the altar balls are nice but you also get them for free just by going to stop sits now they're not terribly hard to get you also get a lot of ultra balls when you level up like I just hit level 29 and I think he gave me 10 or 20 ultra balls just for leveling up it's just a real bummer of a scale unlike the Christmas and New Year sale they they had they had multiple boxes with most sales obviously the more money you spend the better the deal is but just just for reference here I'll point out the Pokemon Christmas go event so they had what is what was called an ultra box which was 1500 coins so $15 you got 20 ultra balls six egg incubators and 25 incense and 25 incense was 1,250 Pokemon coins plus the cycle six egg incubators which was 900 Pokemon coins so you're saving you're saving about 600 you're saving about $6 there if I did my math right plus you're getting 20 ultra balls for free now that's a deal now might not be the best deal but it's a better deal than saving 80 cents the new year sale the gold polka box that you could buy was I'm gonna round up 20 coins here was 2500 coins you're getting 50 great balls which is unbel 25 in cents 25 lucky eggs and 16 lure modules 16 lower modules is about $14 25 lucky eggs is about twelve dollars and fifty great balls are unbel so you're saving some money there too you're saving I think about another six or seven dollars there too when you put on paper that a player is saving about five dollars and then you look at the sale and you're not even saving a dollar I mean that's that's night and day of how good the sale actually is so it's a little bit disappointing that this is an opportunity to give Pokemon go money to celebrate well you and there's there's debate whether you should or should not give money but if you're willing to buy stuff and you're told there's a sale coming up and you're like okay I've been playing this game for a year I'll give them a couple bucks because look at how much value I got for a year or I'm gonna give them money because I've always been giving them money this is just a huge letdown I mean I agree 100% you're not the first person I've seen complaining about this who was was that an actual question of who was the first person I saw I asked that I don't really care it was somebody in England because they were complaining that it was 14 pounds now is that pound sterling I have no idea wait what's the day this is going there's no difference it's just sterling is the ooh let's see if I actually know this I believe sterling is just the term for the currency itself and pounds is the term for just like the the bill so we don't really have an equivalent in the US but it would be like you know how if we say like if we're talking about the currency we would say US dollars mm-hmm and then if we were just gonna say how much something cost you'd say like it's ten dollars like in in Britain they have oh let's see I might be wrong but I think the way it works in the UK is the currency as a whole is called sterling and pounds and pence I think either like terms for the the different denominations that make up the currency sterling and probably so wrong I have a question hopefully it doesn't go to off the rails okay Britain uses pounds right mm-hmm well the United Kingdom uses okay sure we don't know we are doing better had that had that mess of a conversation and there was I think it was a Lance black sent me a pretty great video that I could be wrong I apologize we have a lot of people from the United Kingdom in slack and they're all really great and they tried to sum it up but it gave me more questions than it did answers like I understood the video but it doesn't the rest of Europe use euros yes over the UK is is an interesting exception so even though well for a little while the UK is is is in the European Union I believe when it entered the European Union it from the start had the stipulation that it wasn't gonna play this game of yes correct this centralized European currency the euro and the sort of an exception was made for the United Kingdom that they got to keep their native currency so if I go to Europe to get myself a mr. mime which is just a hypothetical that's not going to happen and I go to like France first and I have all these euros and then I go over to Britain because because it's just a right over the right over the pond I don't know they go it you go through you go through the channel ah it's called the channel so I go through the channel I get to Britain and all I have now is euros do they take that but you have to convert them like any currency exchange and then when I go back like I want to hit up Germany on my way back I have to convert it again right yeah you have really planned your trip and very poorly because you're like literally crossing a body of water and then crossing the same body of water I'm just I see money in London I seem to have been wrong about my previous guess of what the sterling and pound sterling means apparently it's just called pound sterling and it's just it's just what it's called and I was wrong about my previous guess all right I have an interview here with Niantic and John Hanke about the first year Pokemon go and what's coming next this is off the verge I won't go through the entire interview you can go to the verge come to read that now that you're coming up on the one-year anniversary how do you feel about the state of the game and where you want it to be so Yantic I'll just saying the antic says well it's been a great year we've been incredibly grateful for everything that that has happened we've gotten ourselves into a position where we're able to put a lot more resources onto the team over the past year we are careful in hiring people so we've ramped up over the course of the year but finally seeing the fruits of that fruits that in the gym andrade release which we'll get to in the near which gets things that are near and dear to our heart like cooperative social game play things that pull people together outside so we are really happy with the initial phase of this that release we're super excited about how that's going to interact with the events we've lined up for the duration of the summer in Chicago Yokohama and Europe it's been great to get that release out there and fix some aspects of the gyms that were bugging us that we didn't really like but we had to leave things when we shipped the product but we're really happy with the release in June and we're glad to see a positive response it has been really energizing to the playerbase and I think that will do even more so in June and July as the events take part when you look back over the last 12 months are the things you would have done differently that changed differently with the perspective you had now the antics said we have delayed the ability to get things like gyms and raids and we haven't gotten to our player-versus-player and some other things that we thought we'd be able to do pretty shortly after launch but we only had so much money and well anymore guys and we were doing that we were doing what we thought were it was reasonable what about in terms of communication do you wish you hadn't talked about things like PPV PR trading given how long they're taken to implement the antics said what we had well had we not had to divert resources to infrastructure versus features I think we would have had some of those things out earlier I don't know if we had known we were going to have those delays maybe we wouldn't have talked about them so much although it's important to let people know what you're thinking about certain things and that you're building towards them even if they're not immediately available I think early on between ourselves the Pokemon company and Nintendo there wasn't really a consistent consensus about how to communicate with players on forums reddit Twitter and other social media platforms with our previous game ingress we were very communicative with the players and very open on a side note I heard ingress players say that's not 100% true but ok the antic says hey and we weren't as communicative and open in the beginning of Pokemon go because that was sort of a new process for our partners I think we've become much more open over time which I agree with and I think that really helps make the community happier by us being present and talking about what's going on more has there been a sizeable effort internally to fight cheating from the outside it definitely seems like a lot of effort was put forward the antics says we dedicate resource to it for sure there are some people working on the on the team that could be working on other features but they're not implying they're working on this it's a fraction of the team it's not half the team that's working at it but it's significantly less than that but there is a chunk of resources we devote to cheating and then finally the final question I skipped some what do you think is the most important update or changes you've made to the game with regards to keeping player feedback coming back regularly well with regards to keeping players coming back regularly the antics said if I had to single out one it's the gyms and raid update that we just put out it really is the nurse it really is the first new mechanic that gives players the motivation to keep playing to keep leveling up pokemon and to continue to get out there and be active the collecting mechanic was something that was really the heart of the game and still is the heart of the game for new users but this improves the game for other players for players that have reached a certain level I think that's the single biggest change because of the challenge and the opportunity of the fund that it presents to more experienced players and also it's designed to encourage cooperative play which is the core to our mission so there you go that's the interview that you can read the rest of it on the verge you guys have any feedback regards to that I know they mentioned the Pokemon company in Nintendo and they mentioned that collecting was important pretty much all the Pokemon things you would expect but yeah I'm doing very poorly at the collecting aspect I just looked at my pokedex and shoes I got a ways to go what's what's your decks number I have caught 50 I think about the engine is hoot-hoot now I think the only bit that I disagree with is is their claim that about how basically defending themselves for saying if there was going to be trading and battling way back way before it's those features still don't exist and don't look like they're going to for a long time when the representative said something along the lines of oh it's good to just let everybody know what's coming down the pipeline I find that to be a strange response given that it doesn't even seem like it was in the pipeline at that point because it's bits it's been so long it's there's a point at which it is kind of disingenuous to market your game in that way when that's so far off into the horizon you know I don't know yeah so this is typical tech executives speak and I have her had first-hand experience with this where you know a tech executive will actually ask the people who do operational work oh you know do you think we could have player-versus-player battles in Pokemon go and the operational people would be like yeah sure we can do that and then the tech executive takes that immediately to mean by next week versus the three years given the resources you've provided us that will be required to actually deliver that you know tech executives they're more on think and you just can't take them for much I think that's a good point that will make as somebody who works on a company's website as my nine-to-five job there's always there's like this big not disconnect but maybe not full understanding of how things are done tech wise with the website when I'm in a meeting and a group of people say hey we want to do with this with the website is that possible the answer is yes definitely but they're never thinking about their I I think what they're thinking is oh Steve's gonna say no because of this this and this when in reality anything is possible on a website if you want this drop down on all the product pages to have customers sign up for a subscription or something sure I can do that but I don't but the people asking the question are more concerned with the no or yes instead of instead of how much time it would take so your timing Riis right that's right they don't think about time and review so I can say yes and then follow up but that's going to take I don't know let's just say three months to implement and then all of a sudden it's like was that worth our time because hey if it's gonna take me three months and I'm the only person here I can't work on these other projects that you've suggested in the past because I can't do both at once well maybe I can but this is just an example so I would imagine the same conversations happen here where hey can we do trading yeah totally except if we do trading it's gonna take this long to implement where that person just heard hey we can do they said we can do trading so let's tell our customer base that we can do it that makes sense aye aye I'd say I would give you two and if somebody wants to become a tech executive here's here's your guidelines on two things that you need to have as part of your personality to be a successful tech example number one willful ignorance about the realities of what it takes to bring a product to the market and even if somebody comes to you and gives you a step-by-step explanation of what it's actually going to take to bring something in the market like a second later you just forget that and remain ignorant of it and to the ease and great ability to take credit for other people's work and feel a lot of satisfaction in the work that other people have accomplished for you that very great industry it's like a great industry that maybe like everybody's gonna have a great time in yeah totally there's a part in the interview that I skipped over because the overall the question wasn't that interesting the answer wasn't that interesting but the the response was pretty much the antics said they're six months behind with everything so what that means is this Jim Andrade update should have been six months ago and generation two should have been six months ago from when it came out and whatever update other updates they did just think of it as those updates were extremely late to what their original map or game plan said so while I believe that trading and PvP is still coming which is which is fine I think that's all right there are still questions that have not been answered which I think are more important so in the in the sense of PvP what is the benefit of that like what what happens with players that makes that compelling or fun to do because I'll be the first one to get up and say wow I liked the concept of gyms and raids and I love the meeting new people and I definitely like three days ago did a venusaur raid by myself and five other strangers and we were all talking and they were all really great and really nice and we talked about going to Pokemon go fast and one of the guys well it was really funny because after we finished the raid one of the guys was like who's pkmn cast like what and I was like oh that's that's me that's my user name and they're like like the pod cast and I was like yeah yeah III do Pokemon pod cast they're like oh my gosh I listened to that I was like oh wow that's really cool and we talked for a little bit so everything about gyms is so great like what I just said the meeting new people the cooperation the the going out and doing it like it's all great but the actual battle is the most non substance boring thing in the world I've just tap as fast as you can you could dodge if you want to but why does it matter I have 700 revives who cares it's just not enjoyable but the concepts there so when you tell me that hey we're working on pvp III what is the benefit they're like what I'm sure they'll think of something that I I can beat you in a battle and then say that I am better than you yeah what more do you need I don't know but it but is it I can beat you in a battle or is it who spent more time with Pokemon go and who tapped faster I mean once the different matter actly and I I would hope that trading is coming and they said that it I mean that they didn't say they're cancelling it but I I do think that they have to put more efforts or they have to really figure out a way to get rid of the cheating that has already existed and you're gonna always have cheaters on online games like I'm sure that they're still cheating and overwatch and counter-strike and whatever other games that are out there but at least I don't want and I'm sure other people don't want a situation like the mainstream Pokemon games where I'm to the point in the mainstream games where I'm scared to do wonder trading because I don't know if I'm getting legit or non legit Pokemon and I and while some people don't care I do care I don't want an action replayed red Gyarados in my Pokemon bank I agree now why would you use a cheating device to get a red Gyarados the most common the shiny everyone has if they've if they were like hey we want to do trading we haven't mastered the cheating aspects of it I will wait till that has been mastered well just never trade with anybody with an Android device so what we'll do now is we'll take a quick break I just want to run down the two winner or the winner of the Masters video game competition in the Masters TCG comm competition so we'll run down those after break we'll do a couple emails and then travis has our pokemon of the week so we'll take a quick break and we'll be right back after this bang-bang [Music] yep [Music] and we are back from our break let's talk about some TCG masters division yeah I'll be right back so we're just gonna be talking about masters so the master championship the the champion for the TCG masters division is toward rec live and the runner-up was John Cutler and the decks being used for that toured from Norway was running a duranta gar boater and tapu lele GX and John Cutler was running decidua vileplume Shaymin IX lugia e^x and tapu Lele hmm and if we jump over to the VGC the master division there the winner was Christopher Kon and the runner-up was Paul chow and Christopher Kon of Australia was running porygon to Kapoor Coco Gyarados Arcanine Garchomp and Snorlax and the runner-up Paul was running not a lowland ninetails Garchomp Arcanine tapu Coco Sela Stila and Snorlax so I wonder if the junior winner Nicholas Khan is related to the Masters winner Christopher Kon interesting they both have the same last name and it's not a common last name they're both from Australia no that seals it and seals the deal and Australians are cheaters so I am this has been said in the show I am not really into competitive VGC but when I look at this Travis correct me if I'm wrong but I'm seeing for Pokemon that are the same between this type of Coco Gyarados Arcanine and but sorry not geared us Garchomp Arcanine Snorlax and top of Coco if I'm not mistaken Garchomp has been pretty dominant in every every single year I feel like Garchomp has made it to the end I mean Garchomp is quite a large boy Garchomp is kind of the this is for a long time been sort of the go-to for like I need a big dragon that can deal a lot of damage and be fairly fast the typing is pretty good I mean there was a lot of big dragons there's salamence there's Dragon Knight right but being able to have like a same type of tack bonus earthquake and just the base stats are kind of what you want them to be for that niche like it's a very strong pocket monster what's what's the what is garchomps foil what one pokemon destroys Garchomp instantly what you want to talk about aloe and ninetails like I mean that's that's in there I mean it's it's any any ice type move right cuz mochas like most garchomps aren't running the ice defense Barry whatever whatever that one is and lo1 ninetails outspeeds Garchomp so just use blizzard and it's probably gonna be dead papa Coco I think every single team had taboo Coco what's your analysis on that I mean our k9 is more common but top of Coco is like probably the second most used Pokemon why I guess is it is it electric terrain is it it's I feel like I saw that Z move out of everyone else does he move more I mean it's kind of like any Pokemon that can set up some type of stage effect that benefits itself immediately is probably gonna be good taboo Coco's speed is like better than pretty much anything else in the format like I can't think of a single Pokemon that is used that really out speeds it and speed is very important though having a Pokemon with a hundred and thirty base speed which is wild to begin with and then the fact that it sets up a terrain bonus that increases its already pretty strong same type attack bonus moves like that's pretty good both Gyarados and arcanine from Christopher's team the winner here both with intimidate I've watched right yeah that's why arcanine is the most used pokemon in the format is primarily because of intimidate Enders because arcanine has is kind of flexible in terms of a lot you can do a lot of things with that Pokemon yeah since black and white being at the National Championship for black and white seeing intimidate me used a lot they're seeing it being used a lot throughout every single tournament just seems like people really like that ability because well and really good like it yeah people probably hate that ability because it's everywhere I mean it's just kind of like the best ability to have in terms of doubles especially if there are a lot of physically attacking Pokemon in the format like that's one of the reasons why even though top of Koko has higher physical attack on Special Attack virtually every type of Koko you're gonna see is actually a special attacking one because it's like well I mean you can basically say any physically attacking Pokemon actually has half that attack because it's going to be struck by an intimidate the second it runs in yeah yeah the the nice thing about intimidate is it hits both of your opponents immediately right and you can swap in and out and every time you come back in with intimidate it hits again it's very free and it's very widespread I can say that if anybody wants my secret rare gar boater TCG card I'm sorry somebody's already claimed it it's yo cute it's got that gold border I missed most the most of the TCG stuff I do plan on rewatching it but will did you have anything TCG wise did you look over any of these cards or anything now now I haven't had a chance to look at it I got to focus on the other TCG that's taken up all my time man there's there's stuff going on there left and right yeah so the runner-up John Keller in the and the TCG was running a card I'm pretty familiar with and this card was still in the format when I was playing shaming e^x it has the ability set up when you play this Pokemon from your hand onto your bench you may draw cards until you have six cards in your hand any card in the TCG that lets you draw more cards or search from our cards is pretty valuable most there's so many exceptions in the TCG I would say that most supporter cards which you're allowed to play one of those cards to turn are extremely powerful usually you want to play one Supporter per turn now the the flaw to that is if you don't have a supporter to play you're almost not always but almost at somewhat of a disadvantage because the the pokemon TCG is all about going through your deck as fast as possible and finding exactly what you need so the great thing about Shaymin e^x is if you have a trainer card which you're allowed to play unlimited of those are great but not nearly as powerful as supporter cards so for example if you've already played a supporter of that turn and you didn't get what you needed you could play a trainer card and there are a couple of trainer cards that let you just search for Pokemon so you can play a trainer card search for shame in place Shaymin now Shaymin has the ability that lets you draw until you have six cards in your hand so in doing so you can fill back up your hand really great it's also really good if somebody plays an N and you're close to winning so let's say you have one prize and they have six prizes they play it and they get six cards you get one card so it's a really great way of filling back up your hand and using a trainer card to ultimately get what is a supporter type ability which is refilling your hand and then for poured who is the winner he play garbo derp and there there are two different types he uses but one of them specifically has the ability which is if this Pokemon has a Pokemon tool card attached to it each Pokemon in play in each player's hand and each player's discard pile has no abilities except for garbodor ability so what it really does is it shutdowns everyone else's abilities which is critical especially if rest of your cards in play have no abilities which seems to be the case since their main card was grandpa GX which doesn't have any abilities but shutting that if your opponent's deck is very focused on abilities you're shutting all those abilities down and not hurting yourself because you're not dependent on abilities and that was your winning deck so there you guys go there was some TCG talk I know a couple of you have been asking for it will and I used to play so regularly we haven't played recently but I'm still familiar with what these cards do yep just wait till I move to Milwaukee we'll get back on that pony also the great thing about the pokemon TCG is even if you've only played for like one format cycle the TCG is so it's it's so similar to the video game in the aspect of while you made get different pokemon with different moves the abilities that exist in the game just like the video game are still extremely similar like the Shaymin card or a like garb order or in the past I want to say it was vileplume that did the same thing as garb order wear or something similar almost every single garbo order card has the ability to shut down either items or tools or abilities it shuts down something so even though we stepped away from the format you can look at these cards and go oh this garbodor is just like vileplume from x set or oh this Shaymin card is exactly like the Shaymin card from 10 years ago they just changed they just changed a couple things except for anything that they identified that was clearly broken right because there's like a Machop card out there that's an older Machop card where it was like anything that is a basic it doesn't even have to attack it's an automatic knockout and you know in a format where it was all X's and G X's that are all basics anyways you can't have that because that just becomes unfair a lot of trainer cards are extremely similar like professor Sycamore is just like Professor juniper and has existed since black and white they continue to print and make that card let's do a couple emails here you can shoot those emails over to SBJ at pkmn cast calm or you can go to pokemon podcast comm and hit the contact button first email is from Michael hey I am Michael from Southington Connecticut and first I wanted to say how much I love the podcast it's great second question is or well first wasn't really a question but second question in is if you could be any Pokemon type based on your personality what type would you be Michael I think we've had this question before right and I made some joke about that my soul is ice-cold I'll do a different answer um is it though Travis I've known you for so long and you were maple maybe you are just an ya try to try to think of it I am nothing I mean I do think that is a decent answer given that I am NOT a very I would say you're a caring person I do I do care for people but but like I don't also when I think is my family I think of like rude people or people that are very selfish or self-centered and I don't feel like you are rude selfish or self-centered well thank you maybe and maybe instead I would be something like maybe then a ground-type because I tend to because we're what I was getting at is that like I don't socialize very much okay I'll stick underground and be hanging out by myself you and I had a conversation recently like you know the fact that I talked to you too every week is like more than I talked to like any of my like any of my friend groups and like for some people that would be like you only talk to your friends once a week that's wild for me it's like wow once a week that's a lot of time with anybody yeah yeah and I mean like that's I I tend to be a bit of an isolated person so maybe ground fits my tendency to sort of go underground socially okay I'd have to say grass type because I love nature cuz you love being dirty yes I love rolling in filth that exactly me that's why I love grass type you see now I'm questioning your guys's personality choices cuz besides like running outside and like being out in parks on dirt trails yeah okay continue so you're you're not a you're not a sidewalk Runner is that what you're saying I only when necessary but also right remember where I live literally inside a park cuz I love being surrounded by trees and grass and animals and nature okay good answer I would probably say that I'm a fire-type because I feel like any time I have a conversation with people it becomes an argument or a debate I disagree so true and I'm pretty passionate about what I believe in or what my upon the garbage opinions you have yeah yeah and yeah I would say that's a very fiery personality yeah fired dark because you also cheat in your argument I don't know that ever you will never admit when you're wrong I just agree to this the framework you changed the framework mmm listen back to that to that top 10 Pokemon episode where everyone was saying no on the night I have a more recent example we were having a discussion and Steve said name a fan campaign that was ever successful and I like literally posted him a web page yes and campaign that was successful to bringing it and his response to my posting a direct answer to what he said was well those games sucked anyways while that was true I didn't say prove me wrong and name one successful thing I know that there was it was about crowdfunding games I think I know there have been ones but like and we don't need to talk about this hahahaha see see let's talk about something we can all agree on like politics which ironically we do all agree on which is funny Jeffery Wrightson hello I'm a really long time listener like before episode a hundred listener first time writing in because the internet is complicated as a fan of the podcast and hoenn being my favorite region I was wondering if you could make an episode where the main topic was everything positive about 3rd gen my fellow 3rd Jenners will agree that there are a lot of third gen hate but I get over it because everyone is not the same and you guys are extremely likeable yes even you will it could be a good starting point for every new third generation fan listening to your podcast since they are in a world of hurt again really a lot what really love what you're doing episode 69 is my favorite I also love the entire crew keep up the good work the only Jeffery in Canada like the toys-r-us Jeffery wine I want to pull back the curtain real quick pull back the curtain that will just said which is that if someone's name is Jeffery they have to be the giraffe from Toys R Us pull back there can't be anyone else ignore the man behind the curtain pulling back the curtain RAF in this case the only reason Travis is moving to Canada is because Canada has no Travis is living there right yeah I need to be the only one right right ok glad we're glad we establish this how about this how about I in regards hold on well hold on one sec ago how about instead of doing a whole episode which we we could do but no promises on that to satisfy the need of this question why don't we all say one good thing about generation 3 right now i-i-i i'm thinking i can i this isn't a silence of like oh i can't think of a single thing but i'm just trying to think of what the i can think of a few things in trying to narrow it down i could think I can think of a couple i'll get the easy one out of the way gen3 introduced double battles which i think is one of my favorite ways to battle like i think i think the format should stay I think that the VGC format should say double battles I think that is the best way to competitively experience that format and even though I complain that we see a lot of the same and similar Pokemon in a double battle format I would fear that there would be less variety and it would be less entertaining to watch in a single battle format and therefore while I still enjoy the single battles double battles is my preferred and that was introduced in generation 3 III just I'm just gonna say that the Eevee and IV system well it gets a lot of track like it gets people talked trash about how complicated it is and I agree with them I think it's it's a heck of a lot better than the system in generation 1 & 2 if just like look up the formula it takes to determine V like the base HP stat for generations 1 & 2 and you'll never talk yeah well I guess it's bad in in it's still bad in the Eevee and IV system but it's like the all of the math is sort of backgrounded whereas if you really wanted to figure out how to breed like a perfect Pokemon in in Gen 2 you had to sort of pay attention to a lot of that whereas generation 3 and on with the Eevee and IV system there were sort of even though there was sort of complicated math going on in the background there was like easier math that you could do to just figure out what you needed to do and I think that's a solid move forward so I was going to say in gym it's a good pok√©mon just a lot of good pok√©mon World pok√©mon gen 3 this message is from Alex from Spokane Washington hi spj and crew with the direct last week you can see how behind we are with you miss the best moment for me was when they announced gold and silver for the 3ds because I started out playing Pokemon with Generation and missed gold and silver and for some reason missed the remix so I am very excited to play the original games but I was wondering what are the three best and worst things about gold and silver I actually did not plan for these emails to be backing back back and which if any of you guys plan on getting and which starter would you pick I want to pick cyndaquil thank you guys for the show keep up the good work PS I am from Spokane oh there you go ah Alex so we're just talking about flat Gen 2 here not heartgold so yeah I would assume it was flat gem - uh big complaint right off the bat no running shoes your walk in that entire game level until you get the bike I'm gonna remind everyone you can't use the bike inside buildings and you're still walking really slow and it's so me Wow it just went yeah did you known they first appeared in Gen 2 right none that is correct yeah yeah there you go that's complaint right there I think as a kid I loved on the I thought that I think unknown actually are what caused me to stop playing pokemon gold is it because I would open up my safe file right now I would be in whatever that ruins was ruins of alph where the you know unknown are and yeah I love them so much because as a kid is they had this weird air of mystery around them that I'd yeah really fascinating um I agree I think in it are we just each naming one bad things who don't each have to come up with yeah sister 3 no if I came with three I would say my main complaint about Gen 2 would probably be the kind of shoddy time travel training thing it was cool to make it so that you could trade back and forth between gold and silver and red and blue but it was kind of pointless because you could only trade pok√©mon that you could already get in that first generation so it was like such a hassle to be like oh I guess I have to take all these new moves off of this Pokemon before I can trade it back and it should have just been as they figured out later on in games a one-way transaction to just trade up to gold and silver so you don't have to make all these Pokemon in gold and silver that you could trade you could that could exist in red and blue so that you could get your red and blue Pokemon enough to generation to I have a good thing and a bad thing good thing day and night cycle bad thing is when that game came out as a kid I didn't get off school until 3 I get I had to do all my homework before I could do anything else for the rest of the night which I think in retrospect was probably the right thing for my parents to do because once my all my homework was done I was free for the rest of the night but normally when that hit it was nighttime and golden silver so I rarely ever saw the daytime unless it was me playing on a weekend so that was kind of a complaint yeah but I mean that's kind of good it just changed the clock on your gameboy color but that would be yeah that would be I not if you changed it once and kept it consistent I would so I would say I mean I realize this is the thing that everyone says so I'll expand on it a little bit the just sheer amount of content in that generation is staggering compared to virtually any other generation of Pokemon what I will you know people talk about the post game which is incredible what I will add to that though is that not only is it just a mountain of game for you to play but it's also simultaneously the best paced pokemon game it's not like it's so much content because it takes you 20 hours to go from badge 2 to 3 or whatever it's it's a lot of content and it moves quickly in such a way that like whenever I say something like this and I'm just doing this to preempt tweets I know I'll get whenever I say that a game a certain game in the Pokemon series is paced well or isn't paced well I get I often get a lot of tweets saying like well I like to grind and I like I like spending time leveling up my Pokemon and it's like yes every game allows you to do that and that can be a fun experience however when a game forces you to slow down when it when a game introduces an area whose explicit purpose is to just slow down the action of the game I don't see that as anything but bad in well I should be clear when it's only purpose is to make something feel longer you can you can slow something down because you have you want to have some sort of emotional or story effect behind it to make a place feel sort of grueling and that can add a character to a location but when the developers just want to slow you down because they want their game to feel longer for weird marketing reasons I find that terrible game design and I don't think you really see as much of that in generation 2 as you see in some of the other pok√©mon generations so I think Pokemon I think generation 2 is like the best paced you know generation you know what was really untalked about about Sun and Moon is no one really mentioned that it was the first Pokemon game with side quests and they're not wha-what do you mean that like the like when you go into a town there's in every single town there's at least one person that is like hey show me a drift loom or are as true hey show me a row Bombay and in reality that's the first time we got side quests in a Pokemon game am I am I wrong and there have been people who have said I will trade you my X for your why that's true had to go and catch it and then if you wanted to but they are making it more prominent that's true right so you could also argue that the characters that collect certain items are sort of like side quests like you know give me a big mushroom and I'll give you money like and that is the Eevee trainers to get the Eevee Olight is what is it called for the Z evz oh yeah yeah I was just thinking of that because when you say like I agree with you 100% Travis if there is an area in a Pokemon game where all it's meant is for you to be there and battle wild Pokemon over and over until you hit a certain level so you can continue on I agree that that is a real turnoff to the to the game and as as me because I recently went back to black and white too like three weeks ago and the big turn-off for me was I had all had six Pokemon and most of them were really under leveled and I just wanted to progress in the game and it was hard for me to do that because these Pokemon were under level and I had to sit and cave and grind for that whereas if and the reason the reason that's the case is because I I banked almost all my Pokemon and then because I banked it I couldn't bring them back over and blah blah blah but if I would have just had the six starting Pokemon at the game and I would have went through naturally for the most part they'd be over leveled like the iron most Pokemon games but then I came to thinking if Pokemon wants you to grind why aren't they giving you side quests like most other role-playing games do and whether or not the side quests are good that's a good or bad that's a whole nother conversation but like to send you to a certain area to do a quest which in terms gets your reward but also in terms forces you to level up your Pokemon maybe one or two levels along the way that you probably wouldn't have been doing because it's off the beaten path back path is it's there's value to that without making you feel like you're just grinding definitely I think another good thing about gold and silver this would be my last good thing is that they take the original pokedex and they expand on to that whether that's like politoed or bellossom you talking with split evolutionary chains know just how some Pokemon like there's a connection between the two pokedex numbers I guess bellossom and and politoed are the ones I'm thinking of Gen 4 does that even better with like make mortar and Weavile and elective ah electivire but then you get to like Gen 5 and Gen 6 and Gen 7 and they don't really connect back to the first four games does that make sense yeah I see what you're saying there yeah it makes sense I I happen to disagree because I think the best thing about Gen 5 is that it's almost like a standalone title but gen 3 so what that makes me along is right is I want to have a new gen where they have like further evolutions of Gen 5 Pokemon how about that it'll take place till gen 10 I was I was thinking Ben 10 10 10 - oh no I was thinking of this mostly because of Pokemon go because I'm catching I'm catching more Magnemite because of Magnezone and I'm catching a more electabuzz because of electivire and I'm catching murkrow because of honcho and I'm thinking all those pok√©mon are in generation 4 and generation 3 is for the most part pretty standalone mm-hmm and generation 5 is standalone generations six is standalone and generations seven is pretty standalone I mean you could a lowland variance really they're kind of their own thing but generation four does this great thing of going back to generation one and we haven't seen that since I mean you see the hell I mean I would argue that a lowland forms are a huge attempt of that not insignificant I I just I tend to like games because pokemons trajectory as a franchise is just an arrow point it's just a logarithmic chart just going increasingly towards complexity um the games just get more and more complicated because you had more and more features and more and more Pokemon so I tend to enjoy the titles where you you don't need to worry about previous entries not because I don't know the content of previous entries of course I do because I've played all of them but if I'm trying to introduce anyone to the franchise like I'm not gonna even though Gen 4 is one of my most appreciated generations I'm not gonna give Gen 4 am I gonna give diamond and pearl to someone who hasn't played Pokemon before because like they're not gonna appreciate the things that are happening with like electivire or whatever um there are certainly games that that aim to beast that doesn't necessarily mean like all the games that are aiming to be standalone titles are my favorites and all the ones that aren't are my least favorite but I mean I do if given the choice I I would prefer a game feel like it can stand or it under its own weight I'm not saying that every Pokemon needs an evolution down the line actually quite the opposite I think pok√©mon like Lapras and tauros like I think they stand so solid on their own but Pokemon that don't get a lot of love or you could see potential in like something like a corsola it'd be really cool if like hey generation 8 we got a Corsa LEvolution not only to like give a couple other Pokemon evolutions but to also tie those pokedex a--'s together in some way like how I felt generation 1 in generation 4 really tied those evolution like those Dex's together you know way maybe I'm just overthinking yeah I mean I I get your I get your perspective I just I just have different preference yeah yeah yeah now let's do one more email here this is Derek from Los Angeles California hey all it's Derek from LA here or Derek is a gunner on slack I have two questions for everyone well while having conversation with my wife while we were on the Pokemon go pok√© how most of the main series games are based on real-life locations black and white in New York X&Y France Sun and Moon Hawaii etc and we got to talking about which geographical locations would be awesome for Pokemon games but which city or country do you think would make a great inspiration for the next Pokemon game second question I heard some of the hosts making brief reference to ASMR throughout my time listening to the podcast it's such a different thing that I don't feel comfortable talking about it with people it's much easier to tell somebody I played play pokemon with then it is that I listen to ASMR anyways the references made me wonder is there anyone who on the podcast who listens thanks for being awesome Derek is there anyone who listens for ASMR yeah their name is Logan Jenkins they have a podcast called ASMR use guest list was discontinued I don't know I guess I have if you like ASMR or Pokemon or whatever I totally see the hesitation or the uncomfortableness in telling people and I personally I feel like I've gotten past that when I started meditating I thought it was I probably felt the same way you did about ASMR in the like Oh people are probably gonna think I'm really weird but then I mean when it comes down to it it's not weird for people to go to a gym and workout and enhance their body slash muscles in a way bang and bang clang well some would say clanging and banging so a meditation is really the same thing as working out your body except you're working out your mind and that's kind of how I got over that of like if somebody was to ever question my meditation I could easily give that reference point I don't know if there is one with ASMR or what it may or may not be similar to but I suppose though if you were to find a Harrison it would be very easy to explain that to people I mean one of my favorite things is to watch a youtube channel where a man just walks around dead malls so like we've all got our thing that's that's specific I should probably find going Hyper's but I should probably say that's the this is Dan Bell YouTube channel it's it's a man and he walks around malls that aren't doing very well and talks about them and it's like my favorite thing on the entire internet there is there's a point in time where this was years ago where I was very hesitant in telling people I hosted a Pokemon podcast but now I guess I just don't care yeah I'm in a similar spot because like and in a different way because when people ask me how I met my fiancee well first I say usually I'll just say oh we met over the Internet and then people will say like people well Broadmoor and then I say oh well uh like a dating app like OkCupid I said no I frequently co-host a podcast and she listens to the show and met me through that oh it's a show about well strap in because it's about this great franchise from you know the-the-the folks over in Japan are making really great video game content and one of those franchises is Pocket Monsters you see you've got these little creatures and they can shrink down to the size of something that you can fit in your pocket you can battle and trade them it's really fun it's really groovy and all the kids are digging this one CeCe but for you Travis it's even easier because of the success of Pokemon go I feel like if you were just to say oh it's a Pokemon podcast how many people downloaded Pokemon go like a hundred million or billion or a lot of pho a lot of folks I would be hard-pressed to find a person that hasn't heard of Pokemon go it's true well generally the people who if I say oh we met over the Internet usually younger people will be like oh cool like cuz they get that people can interact with each other online a lot but yeah but usually it's like an older person who's like oh well how does that work and I'd be like well do you know what a podcast is like alright then I have to like so it's a radio and radio a pre-recorded right and then and then they ask like oh well what's the show about and I have to be like well you know that little gameboy you bought me when I was a little kid and so and that's not true I would I got my gameboy from my parents and I was very grateful but like you have to it's it's it's a weird cyclical thing but I've done it so often now that it's just like I just the script just flies out of my mouth well do you have any hobbies slash interests in life that you were hesitant to tell people this program especially after recent things in my career ya know because people don't write people either don't understand that Pokemon is more than just a card game or more than just a pokemon go like they don't understand like how much more there is in everything that T PCI touches so they immediately whenever I say that I'm involved in Pokemon and stuff or even podcasting they like reduce it to the least component that they can think of that they can grasp in their own thinking and then they apply that to me rather than being open to saying oh what this is actually something larger or has greater influence they just can't grasp it so I yeah also you know I am the oldest person that plays Vanguard at my vanguard league I'm I don't know going back to Derek's question hesitant to tell people that they listen to ASMR and again I don't I don't know much about that that community your culture hobby or however it's classified I don't know much about it but I would imagine that there are just like any interest or hobby how niche or quirky or popular or non popular it is I am sure there is a forum or of subreddit or a community that you could probably go to and and ask how to explain it to people that may not know it or what's an easy way to express that that's an interest for you I think the added difficulty that this listener would have compared to the situation's we are describing is that ASMR as an experience is a physical one it's like a thing that your brain does when placed in front of certain stimuli and it's not a certain experience that everybody has so that's probably a difficult thing to like I I only barely can kind of feel weird things when ASMR is happening in my ears like I I'm not you know a very strong responder to that type of thing so I've never really been that interested in it so I can only barely understand it so I can imagine like if someone has never heard of it like what what do you mean what do you mean you know how sometimes when you're at the barber shop and then the back of your head starts to tingle like like it's probably just a weird it's it's probably a difficult thing to describe when it's not something everyone experiences whereas everybody is familiar with things that they enjoy so it's like easier for us to say I just like these Pokemon so I imagine it's more uh it's it's it would be more akin to like I don't know I I think it's it is a bit of a different category so I don't quite know how to do it but I think Steve you're right that probably someone's probably got it figured out someone's probably got an elevator pitch for ASMR figured out what one would hope uh well that'll that'll do it for emails if you have your own SBJ @pk men cast calm or hit the contact button I apologize if we haven't gotten to your email yet some of these emails from we're from early July and a gasps um we didn't say what what place we want a Pokemon game to be in the every Pokemon question actually email I would say I would say Iceland would be very amusing woo the land of Ice and Fire absolutely I would say I would want Australia and for there to be really big cities on one side really big cities on the other perth not included and there to be there to be there to be like a bullet train that goes between the two so really they're not even that in real life I would want it to like a plane yeah but you can have a train or something okay well the fantasy I suppose yeah so instead of like a Lola having four different fields generation two having two different fields it would more so resemble generation two and having the difference though is generation two you've already experienced that first feel like when you go back to Kanto you're like oh I've been here before but when you take if you were to have Australia and break it up into two quote-unquote regions or areas we taking that bullet train to the other side and I've never been to Australia so maybe actually in reality they're exactly the same but I I would imagine that Australian listeners would say no the other side is terrible compared to our side taking that train to the other side and then having almost more unique area and then being excited to go back to explore the rest of the first area or something like that that's gets at least what I would enjoy and then imagine all of the really like imagine how angry be people in New Zealand would be if New Zealand was just the post-game island all right Travis give us the Pokemon of the week our whoa what happened to my voice right there our Pokemon of the week this week is pelipper actually pretty commonly used in VGC 2017 because as it stands it's kind of the best option for setting up rain with its ability drizzle let's go to the move sets and sent in I'm trying to pick someone I don't know if we've featured a move set from Riley before no I don't know so I'm gonna do that one because I think we've featured all these other folks um it's going to be a pelipper with drizzle with the item damp rock which extends the length of the rain that drizzle sets up drizzle for those unawares and ability that sets up heavy rain when pelipper or any pokemon with it switches in on damp rock extends the number of turns for which that is the case with a calm nature and with the move set hurricane scald u-turn and roost you can tell that this oh sorry the Eevee spread is 252 and HP 252 and special defense and foreign defense you can tell this is a more defensive set so you're setting up rain for a couple reasons one because it increases the damage of your same type attack bonus scald but also gives you 100% accuracy on hurricane and then the other main reason is probably you're going to set it up with some teammates that can really utilize rain so maybe something that has thunder or if you're really going all out with the water types of common core for VGC teams is to pair it up with Golduck which i think we've talked about on the show before I think we featured Golduck a few months ago that can because it has swift swim can get off an incredibly powerful and very fast z move but just pull up around its own as Riley mentions you get same type attack bonus and scald with a nice chance to burn and actually same type attack bonus on hurricane which has 100% accuracy with drizzle and then you turn gives you the ability to do some damage and then swap out to something that can clean up a situation and then roost is there because you've already got so much HP and defense that getting half of it back is is going to be getting a lot of HP back so that is a more defensive version of it you could do other varieties like the one we recently saw in top 10 of the tournament isn't quite as defensive so I don't actually have the V's here but I can imagine by the fact that it's modest nature that I would be offensively invested and that's some of the same moves so scald hurricane but then protect and tailwind with focus sash as the held item because we're not investing in bulk like we were in the last set so you want to make sure you live a turn to set up tailwind which doubles the speed of all Pokemon on your side of the field so being able to have both rain benefit all of your Pokemon if they synergize somehow whether it be because you know they're like a grass pokemon that would be weak to fire and that fire weaknesses protected a little bit by the rain or because they have thunder and that gets a hundred percent accuracy in the rain or you know any any variety of reasons why rain would help and then tailwind doubling the speed of your Pokemon makes this variety of pelipper quite a good support pokemon that can still deal a decent amount of damage because of the offensive investment and the like 100% accuracy hurricane so yeah you sort of get two varieties they're almost both do they're kind of doing the same thing in that they're mostly there to setup rain for your other Pokemon to utilize but they're doing different things in that one is there to sort of stick around and really force the opposing team to take a lot of damage from its - same type of tack bonus moves even though you haven't invested offensively so there's that defensive pelipper and then the second one we read off is really more focused on making sure that tailwind gets off and then for however many turns it happens to survive after that deal a little bit of damage - does that make any sense yes yep so a shiny pelipper will be have green highlights instead of the blue highlights which we've had the debate of the the use of green and Chinese but this is this is one of the better uses of green pepper ler pelipper shares the same category with duck late-- they are both known as the waterer bird Pokemon and that's all the trivia you get Josh pretty short-sighted there it's like a Stewart great yeah well in the there you go for those that haven't wanted the troughs haven't watched the Sun and Moon anime Pokemon like Pikachu ride in Pella purrs mouth and Island eats them yeah I think like I do think that pelipper could easily swallow Pikachu if if needed well pelicans eat fish do they not yeah I do so what Pikachu is not a fish what's the difference though Mouse fish they both have tiny bones and flesh one uses gills to extract oxygen from water the other breathes air freely from the atmosphere fish have yes scales Pikachu's have skinned with fur mammal versus it would be it sounds like a mouse would be easier to eat than a fish yeah but not so easy to digest but how is it digesting its bones the fish's bones anyways I did not say bones don't put words in my mouth mr. fish yeah don't put words in my mouth let alone bones fish fish meat like bones are easy to digest for everybody except for human beings trust me dogs do it all the time fish meat fish muscle is much easier to digest then in a mammal muscle okay I've been meat so my sushi goes down so smooth but you got a cook that beef no thank you I do like eating raw beef okay have you ever had a sushi have you ever had a delicious like slice of Toro no historically good no I I can't eat anything that comes from the sea no no no you can't if you choose not to it's it's the smell alone that makes me want to gag why are you smelling your food why are you feeling food with your mouth why are you smelling your food food like 70 percent smell isn't that something that somebody said and then no one did research on and then so people just say it yeah like he was just any son of your man what was I gonna say oh just gotta expand your horizons speaking of the Pokemon anime I do a weekly Pokemon anime podcast with Irene where we cover the Sun and Moon anime I think we're on episode 6 so if you're interested in the Pokemon anime I know some of you are some of you aren't you can become a patreon backer to do so that anime is only as of right now through accessible through patreon patreon comm such it's super effective for four dollars a month you can get that brand new podcast with all the episodes already and all future episodes four dollars a month comes to $1 a week so if you want to support us somehow it also gets you access to our wonderful slack community and that is my patreon pitch for this episode and I would say that the lowland vacation podcast is far superior to this one god irene on it it's got Irene on it and she's just a joy and a pleasure so there you go she's very positive on the show as I feel like I'm more positive on the show there's aa the the six or seven episodes we've watched there's only one episode that I didn't enjoy and I think that's the most recent episode about Sophocles but some quick housecleaning I will be a Pokemon go fast we have not decided what the actual plans for that is I know there are its perfective listeners going I know there are a bunch of people in the Pokemon community that might be well-known that are going so I don't know what's going to actually happen there but as we get closer to that I'll announce something Twitter wise Travis is at the Travis W I am at dragging a lake will is at washing the sink we have a sub reddit reddit com it's super effective if you are if you are very active and reddit if you want to help see that community grow there are there 300 plus people there let me know because I am I am into reddit as well but I don't understand everything about reddit when it comes to like recurring daily posts and stuff like that so if you're interested in helping out let me know and we can we could help build up that community even more review us in iTunes I haven't said that in a while if you liked the show and you haven't done so already going to iTunes and reviewing us really helps out really helps with the search engine and other people finding the show and rankings and iTunes so just search for pkmn cast or it's super effective in iTunes or I think just Pokemon podcasts will also get you the first hit on the show so that would be really helpful and ro the final bit of news which i think is probably the most important is it's super effective we'll be celebrating seven years at the end of the month July 29th right well yeah I my birthday yeah I think the show actually started July 28th if I'm not mistaken or I don't remember which one went first something went live on July 28th I don't know if it was the website or the podcast I want to say it was the podcast and then on August 2nd the other one went up which I think was the website but I'm pretty sure on July 29th which is my birthday I'm gonna do something regarding live streaming / possible other live stuff and there are a couple things that I have that that could be done I have a way to stream GameCube games so possibly Pokemon Colosseum or Gale of Darkness were something I was thinking of because those are kind of story ish games I also have a copy of LeafGreen which would be kind of cool because I have the Gameboy player for the Gamecube I can get those Pokemon from leaf green to Sun and Moon whoa yes yeah day so that would be kind of cool especially since because I can transfer them over it would be cool to have community participation of naming Pokemon and catching pok√©mon and building a team and doing something of that sort I am NOT a fan of streaming anything emulated because while that may be easier I think it is important to be able to get those Pokemon to Sun and Moon and possibly out to viewers / listeners I think there's value to that so while we while we laughs and how terrible that transfer system is it can be done otherwise are there there are other Pokemon games that can be streamed too but I do want to do somewhat of celebration that day of seven years I think that's a long time and I think that would be your incorrect a century is a long time all right well let's cancel everything we'll see you guys in three more games good otherwise I think that's our episode thank you all for listening if you made it this far I know this was a longer episode for the amount of poke stuff we had but this has been another episode of the Pokemon podcast and we are super a fast food / secret ribs [Music] [Applause] keep that dog clean in 2017 if you like cats motorcycles computers video games comic books you can head over to drunk on tacos dot-com one of our patreon sponsors of the show that strong
