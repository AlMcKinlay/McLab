[Music] (0:01 - 0:30)
what's up everyone welcome to the 413 (0:26 - 0:32)
episode of the Pokemon podcast it's (0:30 - 0:36)
super effective I'm your host SBJ with (0:32 - 0:41)
me today will ya hi I love Pokemon and (0:36 - 0:44)
yesterday I went mountain biking for the (0:41 - 0:46)
first time and now I have a bruise on my (0:44 - 0:48)
heinie that is in the shape of the state (0:46 - 0:50)
of Texas did you get a new car a new (0:48 - 0:52)
cart heck no oh that wasn't your car (0:50 - 0:55)
than that the bike was on correct got it (0:52 - 0:57)
never a mountain bike alone in case (0:55 - 0:59)
something grievous happens you need (0:57 - 1:01)
somebody to take you to the hospital (0:59 - 1:03)
that makes sense Greg that was not your (1:01 - 1:08)
car I'm assuming heck no I got out on (1:03 - 1:12)
the trails you won't get me on the (1:08 - 1:13)
trails heck yeah (1:12 - 1:15)
what mountain did you go to there are no (1:13 - 1:17)
mountain yeah the land of a million (1:15 - 1:20)
rivers there's that but mountain biking (1:17 - 1:22)
is kind of a very vague and unspecific (1:20 - 1:24)
term that actually you went off-roading (1:22 - 1:28)
on your bike you went off pathing it's (1:24 - 1:31)
it is a mountain bike trail and actually (1:28 - 1:34)
I realize I said it's a vague and (1:31 - 1:37)
unspecific term that captures a number (1:34 - 1:39)
of sports including jumping off tall (1:37 - 1:42)
cliffs and landing which I did not do (1:39 - 1:44)
where did you go though uh (1:42 - 1:48)
lakeville okay Greg how are you I'm you (1:44 - 1:52)
know hey it's 63 today I sat outside of (1:48 - 1:54)
the restaurant 16 feet away from (1:52 - 1:57)
everybody else and I had brunch sounds (1:54 - 2:02)
lovely normal life yeah it was nice this (1:57 - 2:04)
restaurant did provide civil where (2:02 - 2:07)
unlike last weekend where they wouldn't (2:04 - 2:09)
unless you asked for silverware (2:07 - 2:13)
intriguing mmm well we got a jam-packed (2:09 - 2:16)
show this is the last episode before the (2:13 - 2:19)
aisle of armour I think I said it right (2:16 - 2:22)
not the armor of Isle armor island is (2:19 - 2:25)
harmony island yeah welcome to armor (2:22 - 2:26)
island (2:25 - 2:28)
so last show normally we have like a (2:26 - 2:31)
game show last show forever normally we (2:28 - 2:33)
have a game plan normally when like new (2:31 - 2:35)
Pokemon stuff comes out I usually give (2:33 - 2:37)
Greg and well time off so they can enjoy (2:35 - 2:38)
the games without stressing and then I (2:37 - 2:40)
do like this miniseries (2:38 - 2:42)
but I add like five minutes of content (2:40 - 2:43)
how much time do we need (2:42 - 2:46)
yeah I'm not I said at least seven hours (2:43 - 2:49)
of content thank you that's a Saturday (2:46 - 2:53)
expect a normal episode next Monday (2:49 - 2:56)
whatever that number is 414 and if there (2:53 - 2:58)
is a lot of content and we might need to (2:56 - 3:00)
break it up then we might do a bonus (2:58 - 3:02)
episode on like Friday or Saturday for (3:00 - 3:04)
you guys but I'm not sure this is the (3:02 - 3:06)
first time they've ever done DLC so it's (3:04 - 3:09)
weird I expect I expect the story to be (3:06 - 3:14)
amazing two to three hours and then I (3:09 - 3:17)
expect the wild area to be a couple (3:14 - 3:20)
hours of you know continuing to catch (3:17 - 3:24)
things we all know you are spending 17 (3:20 - 3:27)
hours playing with a robot that is all (3:24 - 3:29)
you're going to do you're devoting an (3:27 - 3:33)
entire stream to cram a bot cram o matic (3:29 - 3:36)
crab memetic bot and we don't even know (3:33 - 3:39)
when this comes out it's on the 17th (3:36 - 3:41)
question mark yeah I mean it's within a (3:39 - 3:46)
23 hour 59 minute time range don't be so (3:41 - 3:48)
extreme that it's like a mystery that (3:46 - 3:50)
you have to have a crystal ball yeah (3:48 - 3:52)
well let's let's let's start off with (3:50 - 3:54)
that Pokemon news because we don't (3:52 - 3:57)
actually know when this game releases (3:54 - 4:00)
besides the 17th and we're recording (3:57 - 4:04)
this on the 14th and there is no actual (4:00 - 4:08)
timeframe here what we do know and this (4:04 - 4:09)
is our first bit of news is Pokemon home (4:08 - 4:11)
will have maintenance on the 17th so (4:09 - 4:16)
that plant of that could be something or (4:11 - 4:17)
it could be unrelated (4:16 - 4:21)
he knows something could be something so (4:17 - 4:23)
this is in the Pokemon home app it says (4:21 - 4:25)
thank you for the continued support of (4:23 - 4:28)
Pokemon home.look Game Freak you already (4:25 - 4:29)
got money (4:28 - 4:32)
so like I can back out of this agreement (4:29 - 4:37)
oh you know what I what because I (4:32 - 4:42)
haven't played my Pokemon bank since my (4:37 - 4:44)
Pokemon home transfer you had to buy (4:42 - 4:46)
Bank again they had to buy Bank again (4:44 - 4:48)
see this is how they get nickel and (4:46 - 4:51)
diming you yeah I I had to ask for the (4:48 - 4:54)
silverware once I purchased it yeah (4:51 - 4:56)
I went in and I was like oh no there's (4:54 - 4:58)
no Pokemon here they deleted them and (4:56 - 5:01)
then I was like wait a minute (4:58 - 5:05)
I moved them all but I knew it was my (5:01 - 5:06)
account because it remembered all the (5:05 - 5:10)
names of the boxes so I was like oh yeah (5:06 - 5:11)
everything is still here (5:10 - 5:13)
so anyways because you had to transfer (5:11 - 5:14)
stuff from the 3ds (5:13 - 5:17)
I had to yes so I'm on a mission to get (5:14 - 5:21)
all 890 Pokemon before the DLC which if (5:17 - 5:23)
you're listening to this on Monday I (5:21 - 5:25)
will be trying to get the last 60 (5:23 - 5:28)
Pokemon on twitch.tv slash pkmn cast ten (5:25 - 5:30)
hour stream on Monday fearless if you're (5:28 - 5:32)
in the future you missed it but I have (5:30 - 5:35)
60 more Pokemon to go what does get them (5:32 - 5:38)
mean he means catch them himself and not (5:35 - 5:41)
get them trained and he he claims he is (5:38 - 5:44)
hunting them when in reality he is (5:41 - 5:47)
randomly going to places and stumbling (5:44 - 5:49)
upon Pokemon and going oh I need that (5:47 - 5:51)
one and then claiming it's the thrill of (5:49 - 5:54)
the hunt when really he is stumbling (5:51 - 5:56)
around fine but you understand when you (5:54 - 5:59)
find something how do you not have them (5:56 - 6:03)
already okay okay so I have I have like (5:59 - 6:06)
eight living Dex's I have one in Pokemon (6:03 - 6:07)
go that is useless to me right now (6:06 - 6:09)
because I cannot merge that with Pokemon (6:07 - 6:12)
that's okay given that point taken I (6:09 - 6:17)
have seed i living decks in in LAC - (6:12 - 6:20)
white - the first games that introduced (6:17 - 6:22)
the shiny term but I cannot move those (6:20 - 6:26)
Pokemon out of there yet because I'm I'm (6:22 - 6:28)
missing like 40 Pokemon in that that I (6:26 - 6:30)
have - you don't have a little bit (6:28 - 6:33)
almost lemming decks and then I have no (6:30 - 6:39)
no I have like I have a bunch of the (6:33 - 6:41)
starter poker in my current living decks (6:39 - 6:43)
in home I'm missing like the middle (6:41 - 6:45)
evolutions the forgettable ones you know (6:43 - 6:50)
the kracken oz the koalas the the most (6:45 - 6:51)
important ones (6:50 - 6:55)
yes but Grovyle howl of how do you claim (6:51 - 6:58)
living decks without having all the (6:55 - 7:01)
Pokemon I have those I have those I have (6:58 - 7:03)
those middle ones the Forgotten ones in (7:01 - 7:05)
black - white - like (7:03 - 7:06)
I can't move them up to into sword and (7:05 - 7:08)
shield because they need to stay in (7:06 - 7:11)
black to light - for now see I have a (7:08 - 7:14)
grand plan here right I have all so I (7:11 - 7:18)
like here so in my Lindex in home I'm (7:14 - 7:21)
missing a zoo zoo Merle and I have one (7:18 - 7:25)
in in x and y but it's shiny so I can't (7:21 - 7:28)
move that into the home Dex because it (7:25 - 7:30)
doesn't have enough ribbons on it to be (7:28 - 7:32)
worthy enough to get moved into home so (7:30 - 7:35)
it has to live in my for now my word I (7:32 - 7:37)
have to find another azumarill this is (7:35 - 7:42)
the problem with the season this is your (7:37 - 7:45)
problem here is this is your madness of (7:42 - 7:47)
King Steve problem right there like I (7:45 - 7:48)
know where they are (7:47 - 7:50)
I can go horde hunt them in X&Y just go (7:48 - 7:51)
go back and get another one it's all (7:50 - 7:52)
good it's part of it's part of the (7:51 - 7:56)
thrill of the hunt we will be hunting (7:52 - 7:59)
ok so I've made the poor decision of (7:56 - 8:03)
moving my Reshiram and my zechariah (7:59 - 8:07)
zechariah and rescher LOM I made the (8:03 - 8:09)
poor decision I caught them in ultra Sun (8:07 - 8:11)
ultramoon and then I moved them up (8:09 - 8:14)
without thinking I need both of these in (8:11 - 8:18)
my parties to get the Kuro ROM Hyrum so (8:14 - 8:21)
now I don't have kirim because I and I (8:18 - 8:24)
can't III would either two options here (8:21 - 8:25)
cuz thrill of the hunt somebody could (8:24 - 8:27)
just trade me a kirim but that's that's (8:25 - 8:30)
no fun I need my own kiram and I do have (8:27 - 8:32)
a cure man black - my - but that caroms (8:30 - 8:34)
not allowed to come up yet (8:32 - 8:40)
what so I have two options I either go (8:34 - 8:43)
to one of my other ultra games and I (8:40 - 8:46)
find my restaurant Russia Ram zekrom in (8:43 - 8:48)
those games and then move them over to (8:46 - 8:51)
my main ultra Sun altra and then go hunt (8:48 - 8:56)
kirim or I think this is fair I borrow a (8:51 - 8:58)
restaurant and a Zekrom from somebody to (8:56 - 9:00)
put in my party and then I can start the (8:58 - 9:02)
thrill of the hunt to find the kirim and (9:00 - 9:04)
then when I'm done getting the cure of (9:02 - 9:07)
my return said Zekrom and rush Ram to (9:04 - 9:09)
their owner yeah who's gonna be foolish (9:07 - 9:11)
enough to lend you that hey I have (9:09 - 9:16)
Pokemon for collateral such as you know (9:11 - 9:18)
I can I can let that person hold on to (9:16 - 9:23)
you know meloetta or a Zahra hora if (9:18 - 9:25)
they don't believe I'm gonna why would I (9:23 - 9:30)
steal now you're just gonna accidentally (9:25 - 9:32)
delete it yeah you're like I don't need (9:30 - 9:32)
this anymore (9:32 - 9:36)
release release and then all weekend (9:32 - 9:38)
I've heard people say well you know (9:36 - 9:40)
azumarill is in the expansion but the (9:38 - 9:43)
goal is to get these Pokemon before the (9:40 - 9:44)
expansions because I'm going to catch (9:43 - 9:47)
all 100 Pokemon again in the expansion (9:44 - 9:48)
because I genuinely like catching (9:47 - 9:50)
pokémon that brings us back to our home (9:48 - 9:56)
article so it says this notice is to (9:50 - 9:58)
inform you that maintenance for Pokemon (9:56 - 9:59)
home is scheduled for the following date (9:58 - 10:01)
and time during this maintenance all (9:59 - 10:03)
functions of home will be unavailable (10:01 - 10:09)
will take place on Wednesday June 17th 9 (10:03 - 10:14)
UTC to 14 UTC planned and it will affect (10:09 - 10:16)
both in attendance which version and the (10:14 - 10:19)
mobile version of home after maintenance (10:16 - 10:21)
users will need to update the switch (10:19 - 10:24)
version to one point one point zero and (10:21 - 10:26)
the mobile version to one point two (10:24 - 10:30)
point zero the mobile version right now (10:26 - 10:32)
I believe is one point one and the (10:30 - 10:35)
switch version is one point zero point (10:32 - 10:39)
one yes right so UTC time a little (10:35 - 10:41)
confusing I believe for Central Time (10:39 - 10:43)
which the three of us are in that is (10:41 - 10:47)
between 4 a.m. Central Time - 9 a.m. (10:43 - 10:49)
Central Time so it's 5 hours of (10:47 - 10:53)
maintenance on the 17th so I think Sarah (10:49 - 10:57)
be Joe from Serie B also said that it (10:53 - 11:00)
doesn't seem likely and I do I do agree (10:57 - 11:02)
with Joe on this but I would love to (11:00 - 11:03)
hear it as his thoughts it doesn't seem (11:02 - 11:05)
likely that they would release DLC and (11:03 - 11:09)
then bring down home for 5 hours but (11:05 - 11:13)
after they release DLC it would be more (11:09 - 11:16)
logical to be like maintenance is done (11:13 - 11:19)
and here's DLC for everyone because you (11:16 - 11:22)
have to update these Pokemon products (11:19 - 11:25)
that we've taken down for 5 hours yeah (11:22 - 11:27)
no that'll is that they'll watch the DLC (11:25 - 11:29)
once the maintenance is complete yes on (11:27 - 11:31)
home yeah (11:29 - 11:34)
because you can because the whole point (11:31 - 11:35)
of the DLC is that you now have access (11:34 - 11:38)
to all these other pokemons yes but also (11:35 - 11:40)
I could easily see them saying we're (11:38 - 11:41)
taking it down so you can't just dump (11:40 - 11:43)
all the Pokemon in and get whatever (11:41 - 11:46)
reward might be hiding in the DLC for (11:43 - 11:49)
filling out that part of the Dex so they (11:46 - 11:51)
may also be taking it that releasing it (11:49 - 11:53)
taking it down so you can't transfer for (11:51 - 11:55)
five hours again they're like we're (11:53 - 11:57)
gonna throttle you for five hours I (11:55 - 12:01)
don't know look companies throttle for (11:57 - 12:04)
worse reasons for weirder ties yeah I (12:01 - 12:06)
mean I don't think that I just don't (12:04 - 12:09)
think they that is necessarily indicator (12:06 - 12:09)
one way or the other (12:09 - 12:12)
I don't either it just if we know that (12:09 - 12:14)
sword and shield will probably have to (12:12 - 12:16)
receive an update because that's how (12:14 - 12:18)
expansions work right you have the (12:16 - 12:20)
update your product match yeah oh well (12:18 - 12:23)
actually when I bought it just like last (12:20 - 12:26)
week it downloaded a bunch of content (12:23 - 12:29)
yeah right away man I hope this update (12:26 - 12:31)
comes with fixes though I mean that tree (12:29 - 12:36)
texture finally can be all of you I am (12:31 - 12:38)
and the next person who complains about (12:36 - 12:40)
the tree texture I'm coming to your (12:38 - 12:42)
house with an Atari 2600 and of course (12:40 - 12:43)
you can sit in front of it for eight (12:42 - 12:44)
hours (12:43 - 12:48)
this duck was a dragon but if okay so if (12:44 - 12:50)
the deals he come came out first I mean (12:48 - 12:52)
this whole conversations could be (12:50 - 12:54)
useless in 72 hours but if the DLC came (12:52 - 12:57)
out first it would give people the (12:54 - 12:58)
ability to start transferring and then (12:57 - 13:01)
they bring it down yes unless the DLC (12:58 - 13:04)
comes out in the middle of the downtime (13:01 - 13:08)
or oh that when the downtime starts mmm (13:04 - 13:11)
yeah see there's many paths that this (13:08 - 13:16)
could take I mean I think I don't think (13:11 - 13:19)
they're honestly caring if they match up (13:16 - 13:22)
I mean they plan to be I means then they (13:19 - 13:29)
know but I mean so if if home requires (13:22 - 13:31)
an update when it comes back up and (13:29 - 13:33)
requires an additional download on both (13:31 - 13:37)
they may not wish to have multiple of (13:33 - 13:39)
the same server trying to do two things (13:37 - 13:39)
at once (13:39 - 13:41)
dependent has already like when we saw (13:39 - 13:44)
home come out people were bogged and (13:41 - 13:45)
couldn't (13:44 - 13:48)
download home for hours at a time (13:45 - 13:50)
because everybody was accessing it so (13:48 - 13:52)
they may take down home and say okay (13:50 - 13:55)
everybody download the DLC so the (13:52 - 13:56)
surface are only working on that and (13:55 - 13:58)
then once that is done you get a five (13:56 - 14:00)
hour window will update home and then (13:58 - 14:02)
you have to download that update we (14:00 - 14:04)
don't even know how we're gonna play (14:02 - 14:09)
through it like as our suddenly stopped (14:04 - 14:11)
working are we bringing all our pokemon (14:09 - 14:12)
over are we gonna breeze through this (14:11 - 14:14)
DLC in ten minutes because all our (14:12 - 14:17)
Pokemon are level 100 I think what this (14:14 - 14:18)
really says is there's only gonna be (14:17 - 14:21)
five hours of content in the DLC what if (14:18 - 14:23)
they gate it so that you can only bring (14:21 - 14:25)
like do certain things with Pokemon that (14:23 - 14:30)
are under a certain level hmm I can only (14:25 - 14:32)
tell you that there will definitely be (14:30 - 14:36)
home maintenance on the 17th and there (14:32 - 14:38)
will definitely be a Pokemon game (14:36 - 14:40)
releasing at some point in time during (14:38 - 14:42)
that day I mean if it releases at (14:40 - 14:45)
midnight for everyone like games (14:42 - 14:47)
normally release like again this is an (14:45 - 14:50)
expansion though but I don't even I I (14:47 - 14:51)
guess I could do it right it's their (14:50 - 14:55)
game they could release by region / DLC (14:51 - 14:57)
but I don't I can't think of any DLC (14:55 - 15:00)
that has ever been released by region (14:57 - 15:04)
like Final Fantasy the DLC is for (15:00 - 15:06)
everyone at the same time destiny does (15:04 - 15:08)
ease for everyone monster 100 DLCs the (15:06 - 15:10)
same time for everyone I also don't (15:08 - 15:11)
understand why they're doing it on a (15:10 - 15:17)
Wednesday well they the Pokemon company (15:11 - 15:21)
has been consistently inconsistent about (15:17 - 15:26)
everything no grey version no Petrino - (15:21 - 15:30)
off the patterns exactly no new V's and (15:26 - 15:32)
gen 8 no Friday release they're really (15:30 - 15:34)
good at throwing a wrench in things June (15:32 - 15:37)
12th this is going on right now gallery' (15:34 - 15:42)
and Meowth is your mystery gift you just (15:37 - 15:44)

cherished ball plus a hundred plus a (15:49 - 15:54)
hundred experience candies large plus (15:52 - 15:58)

end date like the last three did if (15:58 - 16:02)
you're listening to this podcast now you (16:00 - 16:05)

legendary event featuring the mighty (18:42 - 18:48)
Entei and the opportunity to earn medals (18:44 - 18:51)
the sync pair wearing Cygnus suits (18:48 - 18:53)
includes the debut of Cygnus suit (18:51 - 18:56)
Grimsley and Sharpedo and the return of (18:53 - 19:01)

story chapters the legendary event will (19:01 - 19:06)
be available from June 10th to June 24th (19:03 - 19:10)
the event takes form of a hard raid type (19:06 - 19:11)
battle which you can only deploy a (19:10 - 19:13)
certain number of sync pairs to defeat (19:11 - 19:16)
Entei while you won't be able to catch (19:13 - 19:17)
Entei after beating it you'll be able to (19:16 - 19:20)
show off your defeat with a brand new (19:17 - 19:23)
metal medals are tied to in game that (19:20 - 19:25)
you can assign to your characters you (19:23 - 19:26)
can see what other players that other (19:25 - 19:28)
players can see if you defeat Entei you (19:26 - 19:31)
will earn a medal to prove that (19:28 - 19:34)
accomplishment additionally from June (19:31 - 19:37)
10th to June 29th you can sync you can (19:34 - 19:41)
scout the 5 star water-type Cygnus suit (19:37 - 19:43)
Grimsley and Sharpedo making their (19:41 - 19:46)
masters debut and the return of Elsa and (19:43 - 19:50)
Rotom and they have expanded chapters 24 (19:46 - 19:54)
and 25 have you done the Entei I have (19:50 - 19:58)
not it's it's cool I didn't realize that (19:54 - 20:01)
when you pokemon die they die or (19:58 - 20:06)
uh you can't you've got of what they're (20:01 - 20:07)
removed from your sink yeah they're (20:06 - 20:09)
actually removed from their game yeah (20:07 - 20:13)
the game yeah one for a wrecked it is (20:09 - 20:15)
very similar so if if you haven't played (20:13 - 20:17)
masters or your haven't done this event (20:15 - 20:20)
yet I would I would probably compare it (20:17 - 20:23)
to like a raid boss in in sword and (20:20 - 20:29)
shield where Entei has pretty much three (20:23 - 20:32)
life meters but there there's like the (20:29 - 20:34)
first two are like shields that you have (20:32 - 20:35)
to take down and then once you take it (20:34 - 20:38)
down you have its final life meter and (20:35 - 20:40)
then you can once you defeat it you (20:38 - 20:43)
defeat it but if if you start with your (20:40 - 20:45)
best sync pairs like I did I started (20:43 - 20:48)
with my three water sync pairs that I I (20:45 - 20:50)
powered up and used for the whole event (20:48 - 20:53)
I was able to take down the first shield (20:50 - 20:55)
pretty easily and then half way the (20:53 - 20:57)
second shield and then when in teh (20:55 - 21:00)
defeats you you can go back in but (20:57 - 21:01)
you're not allowed to use those three (21:00 - 21:02)
sync pairs at all anymore they're done (21:01 - 21:06)
so you I went in with a lesser team and (21:02 - 21:08)
I was able to take down the second (21:06 - 21:11)
shield which let me see antes final (21:08 - 21:14)
health bar and then I realized that the (21:11 - 21:16)
rest of my teams are not as good as my (21:14 - 21:19)
water based team and Entei was very easy (21:16 - 21:21)
to clean those up and I was able to get (21:19 - 21:25)
into it down to about 25% but there's a (21:21 - 21:28)
little reset button so you can reset em (21:25 - 21:29)
tase health get all your sync pairs back (21:28 - 21:31)
and you can then re strategize and try (21:29 - 21:34)
it again like I could because I wasn't (21:31 - 21:36)
fully aware of what I was doing I could (21:34 - 21:38)
probably invest a little bit on my first (21:36 - 21:42)
water sync pairs and then going again (21:38 - 21:43)
and have like a stronger first showing (21:42 - 21:47)
so cleanup is easier so it's kind of (21:43 - 21:51)
like a puzzle in a way or maybe you (21:47 - 21:52)
don't want to go with your best think (21:51 - 21:54)
pair maybe you want to go with you know (21:52 - 21:58)
a slightly different sync pair to stop (21:54 - 22:01)
Entei from getting all their power-ups (21:58 - 22:03)
but it's not like pay to win I mean like (22:01 - 22:05)
like the press release says it's not (22:03 - 22:06)
like you can get Entei you just get a (22:05 - 22:07)
little metal showing that you've (22:06 - 22:10)
completed the event but if you like to (22:07 - 22:12)
flex which is 99 percent of Pokemon (22:10 - 22:13)
games at this point (22:12 - 22:16)
and I don't like getting a medal is like (22:13 - 22:19)
okay whatever yeah speaking of powering (22:16 - 22:21)
up sync pairs this was the news of (22:19 - 22:22)
Pokemon masters is our last bit of (22:21 - 22:27)
masters news it's a pretty long message (22:22 - 22:28)
from the Masters team this is volume 11 (22:27 - 22:30)
if you guys remember volume 10 that's (22:28 - 22:32)
when they talked about adding the (22:30 - 22:34)
stannum a system you say we appreciate (22:32 - 22:36)
the feedback regarding sync pairs we (22:34 - 22:39)
plan to improve them we are currently (22:36 - 22:41)
developing a new way to strengthen sync (22:39 - 22:44)
pairs we plan to release these around (22:41 - 22:47)
the first anniversary of the game which (22:44 - 22:48)
is coming up I think what was that (22:47 - 22:49)
September (22:48 - 22:52)
I don't remember we played at Worlds in (22:49 - 22:54)
August I think it was September I think (22:52 - 22:56)
it was September September sounds about (22:54 - 22:56)
right (22:56 - 22:59)
one of the fans most frequent request is (22:56 - 23:01)
to see more new sync pairs as well as (22:59 - 23:04)
existing sync pairs and signa suits and (23:01 - 23:07)
seasonal outfits I think we've only (23:04 - 23:09)
gotten to seasonal outfits and that was (23:07 - 23:14)
for Christmas I think yes many sync (23:09 - 23:16)
pairs haven't debuted or on on their way (23:14 - 23:18)
this doesn't say in the press release (23:16 - 23:20)
but I personally am still waiting for (23:18 - 23:22)
gen8 sync pairs we are working to ensure (23:20 - 23:24)
that sync pairs in Sigma suits and (23:22 - 23:26)
seasonal outfits will appear more (23:24 - 23:29)
frequently than before they talked about (23:26 - 23:33)
AG events events based on egg Pokemon (23:29 - 23:35)
are coming in July I was gonna say are (23:33 - 23:37)
they doing more of those egg (23:35 - 23:39)
distributions they really went so well (23:37 - 23:42)
each Pokemon you can get from these (23:39 - 23:44)
events will be different and each one (23:42 - 23:46)
will have each one's rolls will have a (23:44 - 23:49)
number of passive skills that will be (23:46 - 23:51)
random there will also be a very rare (23:49 - 23:54)
chance that shiny pokemon will hatch it (23:51 - 23:57)
will encourage trainers to try to find (23:54 - 23:58)
their favorites (23:57 - 23:59)
in addition first time they've had (23:58 - 24:02)
Chinese and masters it is their you know (23:59 - 24:05)
in addition to developing these features (24:02 - 24:06)
we are also working expanding the (24:05 - 24:08)
content and preparing for new events (24:06 - 24:10)
there are new legendary events coming (24:08 - 24:13)
and then in May's survey we collected (24:10 - 24:15)
feedback about the three planned (24:13 - 24:17)
improvements which is reduced this time (24:15 - 24:20)
spent battling for items which is one of (24:17 - 24:23)
Greg's complaints yep easier (24:20 - 24:25)
identification of battles that reward (24:23 - 24:27)
items I feel like I know what (24:25 - 24:29)
battles are giving me which items but (24:27 - 24:32)
okay once you know the system yeah but (24:29 - 24:35)
like clicking there's so many clicks to (24:32 - 24:37)
if you don't know like in especially in (24:35 - 24:38)
the training area like I don't know what (24:37 - 24:41)
this means and oh sure Sheila gives me (24:38 - 24:42)
what there's so many clicks to get in (24:41 - 24:44)
there yeah this yeah they definitely (24:42 - 24:45)
need to clean that there's a lot of (24:44 - 24:47)
different sodas too if you're a new time (24:45 - 24:50)
player and a change to the number of (24:47 - 24:54)
battles per day the survey response (24:50 - 24:56)
indicated that many players wanted to (24:54 - 24:59)
obtain more items efficiently even if (24:56 - 25:01)
the number of battles is limited that's (24:59 - 25:04)
what the survey said Gregg I wanna know (25:01 - 25:08)
who they surveyed I wanna have a sidebar (25:04 - 25:10)
with some of these people it's the same (25:08 - 25:12)
people from family feud and then you (25:10 - 25:13)
just look at the answers and you're like (25:12 - 25:18)
you're like why what how base of the (25:13 - 25:20)
feedback will launch a new stamina (25:18 - 25:23)
system based on on a trial base to (25:20 - 25:25)
solicit additional player input to help (25:23 - 25:27)
us create the best possible experience (25:25 - 25:29)
with the current system you can obtain a (25:27 - 25:31)
set number of items based on the time (25:29 - 25:33)
you spent playing and any time you are (25:31 - 25:35)
not actively repeating a battle you are (25:33 - 25:37)
missing an opportunity of playing more (25:35 - 25:40)
of obtaining more items that's a pretty (25:37 - 25:43)
true statement I would say yes that is a (25:40 - 25:45)
very true statement with the stand of (25:43 - 25:47)
most system you'll receive a much higher (25:45 - 25:49)
number of rewards in a shorter time and (25:47 - 25:51)
the time you save will go towards (25:49 - 25:54)
recharging your stamina stamina sorry I (25:51 - 25:56)
mean that mechanic isn't new it's been (25:54 - 26:00)
in most mobile games since the dawn of (25:56 - 26:02)
time here ultimately we hope to reduce (26:00 - 26:04)
the time spent repeating the same (26:02 - 26:06)
battles and provide a more balanced (26:04 - 26:09)
gameplay experience for everyone to give (26:06 - 26:10)
you an idea of what to expect here's a (26:09 - 26:12)
detailed explanation of the new system (26:10 - 26:16)
where stamp stamina is explicable so (26:12 - 26:19)
this is where your limited main story (26:16 - 26:23)
single player only level up area cap (26:19 - 26:26)
unlock area sink orb area evolution (26:23 - 26:30)
material area and some events new limits (26:26 - 26:32)
are not opposed on legendary arena which (26:30 - 26:33)
is the Entei event (26:32 - 26:36)
I explained the battle Villa and co-op (26:33 - 26:39)
battles in general which would be battle (26:36 - 26:41)
villa main story x challenge (26:39 - 26:43)
or certain event battles you can (26:41 - 26:44)
continue to play those as much as you (26:43 - 26:46)
want because the new system will impact (26:44 - 26:48)
game balance we're launching it on a (26:46 - 26:50)
trial basis meaning we'll be listening (26:48 - 26:52)
to your feedback and making improvements (26:50 - 26:55)
along the way or even reverting back to (26:52 - 26:58)
the current system if needed regardless (26:55 - 27:00)
we are working to ensure the final (26:58 - 27:03)
result is enjoyable then they go on to (27:00 - 27:06)
say the current training area will be (27:03 - 27:06)
renamed (27:06 - 27:09)
e.x Plaza and battles found in courses (27:06 - 27:11)
and super courses will be redesigned as (27:09 - 27:14)
a new part of a training area to (27:11 - 27:16)
simplify the process of collecting items (27:14 - 27:18)
we are making it so you can tell which (27:16 - 27:20)
items are easily obtainable so you'll (27:18 - 27:23)
have the level up area the cap unlock (27:20 - 27:26)
area the sync orb area and the evolution (27:23 - 27:28)
material area there will be a maximum of (27:26 - 27:31)
10 attempts available each day in the (27:28 - 27:34)
sink orb area and up to 90 items will be (27:31 - 27:37)
obtainable with each attempt making it a (27:34 - 27:40)
possible to acquire 900 co-op sync orbs (27:37 - 27:44)
each days is that a lot Greg I mean it (27:40 - 27:47)
will get you a lot of the very first (27:44 - 27:52)
level unlocks a lot of ice so like I'm (27:47 - 27:53)
look like like looking at it right now (27:52 - 27:59)
so if I want to unlock Cygnus utilizes (27:53 - 28:02)
one move it I have to spend I think 24 (27:59 - 28:06)
of the coop sync orbs and then it only (28:02 - 28:09)
increases and that's like the first ring (28:06 - 28:11)
out of the basics so it really ramps up (28:09 - 28:16)
quickly like the big move like further (28:11 - 28:17)
down that you want to go towards like a (28:16 - 28:19)
hundred and twenty depending on how many (28:17 - 28:23)
you're trying to do I think it's a fair (28:19 - 28:25)
amount I don't think it's particularly (28:23 - 28:29)
stingy but like it's not giving away the (28:25 - 28:33)
farm either I mean it's it's it's sort (28:29 - 28:37)
of hard to tell like I there's so many (28:33 - 28:40)
that aren't don't have full sync grids (28:37 - 28:43)
yet so right now it's probably great but (28:40 - 28:45)
in the future it could be like this (28:43 - 28:47)
isn't enough but if you start now and (28:45 - 28:48)
they're just building up and you'll have (28:47 - 28:50)
a lot I'm assuming too unlike the ones (28:48 - 28:53)
once everybody's fully unlocked our next (28:50 - 28:55)
message is scheduled for late July (28:53 - 28:57)
we'll go over future updates and (28:55 - 28:59)
anniversary celebrations in more detail (28:57 - 29:01)
we work hard to make improvements we (28:59 - 29:03)
prioritize your feedback until next time (29:01 - 29:06)
Pokemon master Sasaki and operations (29:03 - 29:11)
producer Gucci yeah it's I mean the (29:06 - 29:12)
problem with the stamina system is (29:11 - 29:16)
they're saying it it will reward you (29:12 - 29:18)
know it helps the you you aren't feeling (29:16 - 29:19)
like you're missing out on rewards (29:18 - 29:22)
because it's gonna stop you the big (29:19 - 29:25)
question is how good are those rewards (29:22 - 29:29)
like my hope is that they have looked at (29:25 - 29:33)
how much people would get in a day and (29:29 - 29:35)
have at least come close to matching (29:33 - 29:38)
that with their stamina system because (29:35 - 29:41)
otherwise it will feel like you've (29:38 - 29:43)
artificially put brakes on something (29:41 - 29:46)
that a very small amount of people were (29:43 - 29:50)
doing and those people are the ones that (29:46 - 29:52)
are giving you the most money and you (29:50 - 29:54)
have limited them for no reason and for (29:52 - 29:57)
the rest of us it feels worse if if the (29:54 - 30:02)
feedback it was truly we don't mind (29:57 - 30:04)
stamina for better rewards if that was (30:02 - 30:08)
the general consensus and I don't want (30:04 - 30:10)
to like label people of like oh the the (30:08 - 30:13)
people who don't play eight hours (30:10 - 30:15)
straight who the people who don't play (30:13 - 30:17)
masters eight hours straight straight (30:15 - 30:20)
are clearly not hardcore enough I just (30:17 - 30:22)
think of a like a situation of how I (30:20 - 30:24)
play which is I wake up in the morning I (30:22 - 30:28)
do I get my daily login bonus --is I do (30:24 - 30:32)
like two or three matches maybe maybe a (30:28 - 30:34)
little bit more if there's like an event (30:32 - 30:35)
going on like the whole event obviously (30:34 - 30:38)
I played a lot more and then I don't (30:35 - 30:40)
really think about masters until before (30:38 - 30:44)
I go to bed where I go well I can't fall (30:40 - 30:46)
asleep let's just do let's check Pokemon (30:44 - 30:48)
go alright no good spawns in my house (30:46 - 30:50)
like always all right let's do masters (30:48 - 30:51)
all right let's do three matches and (30:50 - 30:54)
then I go to bed so in my situation and (30:51 - 30:56)
I know this is obviously not everyone's (30:54 - 30:59)
I feel like it doesn't affect me the (30:56 - 31:01)
only thing I'm getting is more rewards (30:59 - 31:02)
for the you know three matches in the (31:01 - 31:04)
morning unless for some reason I can't (31:02 - 31:05)
do like three matches in the morning and (31:04 - 31:07)
it's limited to like two (31:05 - 31:09)
yeah but we don't know like how many (31:07 - 31:13)
matches you're allowed in a day except (31:09 - 31:16)
they said co-op you're allowed ten but (31:13 - 31:18)
also I just it's hard to put myself in (31:16 - 31:21)
the shoes of somebody who's like today (31:18 - 31:22)
is my day to play masters I'm gonna play (31:21 - 31:25)
it from four hours straight because if I (31:22 - 31:26)
have four hours to play a video game (31:25 - 31:30)
it's probably not even mobile yeah (31:26 - 31:32)
that's been my current problem the (31:30 - 31:33)
appeal to mobile games for me is like (31:32 - 31:36)
I'm gonna play it while I'm waiting for (31:33 - 31:40)
the bus or while I'm waiting for you (31:36 - 31:42)
know a table at last time you took a bus (31:40 - 31:47)
[Laughter] (31:42 - 31:50)
match of masters as well puts air in his (31:47 - 31:54)
tire for his bike excitement hasn't done (31:50 - 31:56)
that and my buddy owns a compressor so (31:54 - 31:58)
that takes seconds but here's the deal (31:56 - 32:01)
the problem is you don't let me be (31:58 - 32:04)
polite breathe William you don't have a (32:01 - 32:05)
traditional job (32:04 - 32:08)
those of us with traditional jobs sit in (32:05 - 32:10)
our long meetings where we literally (32:08 - 32:13)
don't have to pay attention or provide (32:10 - 32:16)
any input yeah therefore mobile games (32:13 - 32:17)
come to the rescue (32:16 - 32:20)
yes they do that is where Pokemon (32:17 - 32:27)
masters excels yeah I am hoping that the (32:20 - 32:31)
system like if you get ten per day that (32:27 - 32:35)
that's front-loaded and not you will (32:31 - 32:39)
earn ten over the course of a day so (32:35 - 32:41)
that people who play like you do where (32:39 - 32:42)
you wake up in the morning you're like (32:41 - 32:44)
I've got time so I'm gonna run through (32:42 - 32:46)
my stuff and then we'll have some for (32:44 - 32:50)
the evening instead of I get one in the (32:46 - 32:54)
morning because they come in at a slow (32:50 - 32:57)
rate and they don't stack so I have to (32:54 - 32:59)
plot this out I'm really hoping that (32:57 - 33:01)
it's much more front-loaded like here's (32:59 - 33:03)
here's everything in the morning and you (33:01 - 33:05)
can blow through all them and then you (33:03 - 33:06)
don't have to think about the game for (33:05 - 33:08)
the rest of the day I mean right now (33:06 - 33:11)
it's we have to have the game open 24/7 (33:08 - 33:13)
and we have to keep hitting repeat (33:11 - 33:15)
mission because that's the only way to (33:13 - 33:18)
grind materials and that's not great (33:15 - 33:21)
either like that's not the best (33:18 - 33:22)
the way you could be interacting with (33:21 - 33:24)
the game okay we got a little bit of (33:22 - 33:28)
Pokemon going news we got some more (33:24 - 33:32)

where TCG products are sold (37:13 - 37:16)
what is the manufacturer's suggested (37:15 - 37:21)
retail price it doesn't say what they (37:16 - 37:25)
don't suggest hey what do you think 50 (37:21 - 37:28)
$49.99 I'd imagine it's gonna be (37:25 - 37:31)
somewhere between 50 and 80 yeah he D (37:28 - 37:34)
let's see if somebody else has it cool (37:31 - 37:36)
stuff Inc said they have it out of stock (37:34 - 37:41)
no price well of course because it that (37:36 - 37:44)
you can't put a price on hmm what I mean (37:41 - 37:45)
out of style because it's not available (37:44 - 37:48)
yet so according to this one website (37:45 - 37:52)
cards in all gaming which I don't know (37:48 - 37:53)
this is trustworthy (37:52 - 37:56)
that's about as dubious as most of the (37:53 - 38:01)
places they have one in stock for $29.99 (37:56 - 38:04)
oh that is way under price I am at (38:01 - 38:06)
trolling toad and they say they have no (38:04 - 38:09)
in stock but it was 20 (38:06 - 38:13)
99 Wow oh hey you know that is a good (38:09 - 38:17)
deal that it's a good deal yeah cuz for (38:13 - 38:21)
booster packs and the den A's I mean the (38:17 - 38:23)
Denny's alone get heed to dinner yeah (38:21 - 38:26)
make it seem pretty worth it well until (38:23 - 38:28)
they rotate them out in like a week or (38:26 - 38:28)
ban them (38:28 - 38:31)
no dude na I lied about the den a by the (38:28 - 38:34)
way it's not a $15.00 card it looks like (38:31 - 38:39)
it is closer to a 25 dollar card where (38:34 - 38:43)
is dot-com has it for 39.99 well yeah (38:39 - 38:45)
because every place else ran out so now (38:43 - 38:47)
they can jack up the price but there's (38:45 - 38:49)
pre-order everything's pre-order it (38:47 - 38:50)
doesn't come out until June 26 yes but (38:49 - 38:53)
how does one company have it for $10 (38:50 - 38:56)
more maybe the well sometimes trolling (38:53 - 38:58)
tote and cool stuff Inc will take a hit (38:56 - 39:02)
in the price Hugh stack on the free (38:58 - 39:05)
shipping right cuz it's like oh you know (39:02 - 39:09)
it's $12 to ship this $30 product but if (39:05 - 39:13)
I spend 40 more dollars so this one page (39:09 - 39:15)
that I'm looking on cool stuffing says (39:13 - 39:18)
it's 30 4.99 I'll tell you one thing (39:15 - 39:21)
that I come across in my TCG purchasing (39:18 - 39:26)
quite often is that Oh some places will (39:21 - 39:29)
say they'll have a pre-order stock let's (39:26 - 39:31)
put an imaginary number on it of 20 (39:29 - 39:35)
right and for that original set there (39:31 - 39:37)
they're like all right we'll do close to (39:35 - 39:40)
MSRP will do the $30 and then they judge (39:37 - 39:43)
on how fast that sells out to see Oh is (39:40 - 39:45)
there a real demand for this product or (39:43 - 39:47)
not and if there's if it sells out fast (39:45 - 39:49)
and there's real demand then they'll (39:47 - 39:51)
come out with like a second pre-order (39:49 - 39:54)
set and raise that price like by $10 and (39:51 - 39:56)
then if that super fast sells out (39:54 - 39:58)
they'll raise it another $10 and they'll (39:56 - 40:00)
say this is such a high demand thing so (39:58 - 40:02)
like every subsequent offer to pre-order (40:00 - 40:05)
they just like keep raising the price (40:02 - 40:10)
sounds like a Kickstarter the world of (40:05 - 40:13)
trading card game economics should be a (40:10 - 40:15)
college course because it's disturbing (40:13 - 40:18)
and it's morally bankrupt can I tell you (40:15 - 40:21)
a new TCG issue (40:18 - 40:24)
yes okay so do you guys know I'm in (40:21 - 40:27)
Wills very familiar with this you you go (40:24 - 40:29)
to you know target you go have the TCG (40:27 - 40:32)
I'll you see that they release a box and (40:29 - 40:34)
then in that box is like four booster (40:32 - 40:36)
packs one probably crimson invasion but (40:34 - 40:41)
it has one of those jumbo cards yeah and (40:36 - 40:44)
these jumbo card oh is this your book (40:41 - 40:46)
thing yeah so these jumbo cards have (40:44 - 40:49)
existed since X&Y I think they started (40:46 - 40:52)
doing it I think X&Y I don't remember (40:49 - 40:55)
but anyways they're like useless you get (40:52 - 40:57)
the Jumbo cards I don't know who they're (40:55 - 41:00)
actually for you can see the back of the (40:57 - 41:03)
TCG car very pixelated because it wasn't (41:00 - 41:04)
like originally designed at that (41:03 - 41:08)
high-res of a texture you can't do (41:04 - 41:09)
anything with them I guess maybe like (41:08 - 41:11)
five year old kids or six year olds like (41:09 - 41:13)
love them cuz they're like big versions (41:11 - 41:16)
of their card or whatever but most of (41:13 - 41:17)
the time I just threw them away I (41:16 - 41:20)
already got enough Pokemon junk out in (41:17 - 41:24)
order to put these cards when I ordered (41:20 - 41:29)
the the Pikachu zekrom Charizard rush (41:24 - 41:32)
Ram battle boxes that they released (41:29 - 41:35)
recently which you can see a pattern (41:32 - 41:37)
here in the teeth the seems that the (41:35 - 41:39)
Pokemon company is really trying to get (41:37 - 41:41)
people into TCG with these battle boxes (41:39 - 41:42)
with this new trainer box coming out and (41:41 - 41:44)
the board game and the board game (41:42 - 41:46)
they're like trying really hard they're (41:44 - 41:48)
pushing hard hard hard and they also (41:46 - 41:50)
paid a couple youtubers to like teach (41:48 - 41:54)
people how to install and get into PTC (41:50 - 41:56)
geo online there's a bunch of I mean (41:54 - 41:59)
it's very obvious if you see a youtuber (41:56 - 42:01)
all of a sudden like learn how to play (41:59 - 42:04)
PTC Gio hashtag Edie so that they're (42:01 - 42:06)
they're really pushing this year but (42:04 - 42:08)
that's not the point the point is when I (42:06 - 42:11)
pre-ordered these two boxes the the rush (42:08 - 42:13)
or Ram Charizard and the Pikachu because (42:11 - 42:15)
they have Jirachi 's and they have code (42:13 - 42:16)
cards and they're really good for people (42:15 - 42:18)
who are missing these rare rare or (42:16 - 42:20)
expensive cards it came with a little (42:18 - 42:23)
book like a pre-order like you spent $50 (42:20 - 42:27)
here's a jumbo binder for your jumbo (42:23 - 42:29)
cards is the first time they've done it (42:27 - 42:31)
they've been releasing these jumbo cards (42:29 - 42:33)
since X&Y you know all through Sun and (42:31 - 42:35)
Moon they've had these jumbo cards (42:33 - 42:37)
the Pokemon company officially released (42:35 - 42:40)
a binder for these jumbo cards and I was (42:37 - 42:42)
like great I bought the tax tricity box (42:40 - 42:44)
I bought the polti guys box (42:42 - 42:48)
I bought the GMAX Meowth box and I (42:44 - 42:50)
didn't throw those cards away yet and so (42:48 - 42:52)
I put him in the binder and I was like (42:50 - 42:53)
you know what I think I'm gonna collect (42:52 - 42:56)
jumbo cards now now you have them for (42:53 - 42:58)
your children right I have a place to (42:56 - 43:03)
put them they fit the twist is at some (42:58 - 43:05)
point and the point was when they (43:03 - 43:08)
switched a sword and shield they (43:05 - 43:10)
slightly changed the size of these jumbo (43:08 - 43:14)
cards so everything X&Y and Sun and Moon (43:10 - 43:17)
and detective Pikachu they're like a (43:14 - 43:20)
quarter of an inch too wide and too long (43:17 - 43:24)
so they don't fit into the binder how (43:20 - 43:27)
dare the biggest scam in Pokemon (43:24 - 43:31)
absolutely absent you got scammed so (43:27 - 43:33)
yeah all those cards still worthless but (43:31 - 43:36)
I guess if you're collecting the sword (43:33 - 43:38)
and shield cards you're they'll fit in (43:36 - 43:40)
the binder I don't know where you get (43:38 - 43:42)
this binder by itself by the way I got (43:40 - 43:44)
as a pre-order bonus but I don't you (43:42 - 43:47)
don't you don't you either collect them (43:44 - 43:50)

they're the like local league and what's (46:20 - 46:25)
weird if you're ever down town when (46:22 - 46:28)
downtown opens again you can go to the (46:25 - 46:31)
Target Center building and sometimes (46:28 - 46:33)
they are in their little booth playing (46:31 - 46:37)
their game and it's like a fishbowl (46:33 - 46:39)
thing so you can watch these people just (46:37 - 46:41)
like every other worker is you don't (46:39 - 46:42)
know that they're doing something (46:41 - 46:44)
different it's just like they're quickly (46:42 - 46:45)
it looks like that quickly we're hangin (46:44 - 46:47)
spreadsheets but they're much more into (46:45 - 46:49)
it than everybody else who has open (46:47 - 46:50)
windows downtown but I believe that's (46:49 - 46:54)
them so the Minnesota rocker Call of (46:50 - 46:57)
Duty League is it because VGC could be (46:54 - 47:00)
an eSport that this is an ESPN or have (46:57 - 47:02)
all barriers just (47:00 - 47:06)
for news do we just not care anymore is (47:02 - 47:08)
it just yeah I guess that's news in (47:06 - 47:10)
itself that yes yeah (47:08 - 47:14)
reporting on this reporting on five (47:10 - 47:17)
million is a lot so between the Pokemon (47:14 - 47:19)
company and the antic that's ten million (47:17 - 47:23)
dollars and then on top of the Pokemon (47:19 - 47:26)
companies already two hundred thousand (47:23 - 47:29)
dollars I wonder if they wanted to do (47:26 - 47:34)
more but off the off the bat but there's (47:29 - 47:37)
probably a more legal hoops to jump (47:34 - 47:40)
through between yeah well yeah and they (47:37 - 47:41)
had to get they had to get the (47:40 - 47:44)
permission from Japan so possibly they (47:41 - 47:46)
were like given a small discretionary (47:44 - 47:48)
approval and then it was just like Oh (47:46 - 47:50)
everybody else is doing so much so then (47:48 - 47:52)
Japan was like heck yeah we'll do even (47:50 - 47:56)
more yeah it's awesome very cool and I'm (47:52 - 47:58)
assuming they're probably still doing (47:56 - 47:59)
research on where they want that money (47:58 - 48:01)
to go specifically because some (47:59 - 48:03)
charities had too much money and they (48:01 - 48:05)
were like redirecting to other causes (48:03 - 48:07)
yeah there are a lot in Minnesota that (48:05 - 48:10)
get way overwhelmed by how much money (48:07 - 48:13)
they we're getting and like it's great (48:10 - 48:16)
but they were definitely this please (48:13 - 48:19)
share please share the love so that they (48:16 - 48:22)
aren't sitting on piles of money that (48:19 - 48:25)
they have to report and deal with that (48:22 - 48:27)
they can't use immediately and there are (48:25 - 48:29)
other organizations that yes need it yes (48:27 - 48:32)
so I'm sure this won't be the last time (48:29 - 48:34)
we hear about this when we get closer to (48:32 - 48:37)
go fest I'm sure we will get a list of (48:34 - 48:39)
where that money is going and obviously (48:37 - 48:41)
holding these companies accountable not (48:39 - 48:43)
saying the Pokemon company is going to (48:41 - 48:45)
just say they're donating five million (48:43 - 48:46)
and not donate the five million but (48:45 - 48:48)
right that has been a thing in the past (48:46 - 48:51)
with other company ash will follow it (48:48 - 48:53)
just to hold them accountable and see (48:51 - 48:55)
where that goes because that's very (48:53 - 48:57)
generous of them speaking of Pokemon go (48:55 - 49:00)
we got some bad news and some good news (48:57 - 49:02)
bad news first (49:00 - 49:04)
alright Pokemon go to discontinue (49:02 - 49:10)
support on 32-bit Android devices oh no (49:04 - 49:12)
in an upcoming update to Pokemon go in (49:10 - 49:14)
the beginning of August 2020 we will end (49:12 - 49:16)
support of 32-bit Android device (49:14 - 49:18)
is by removing support for 32-bit (49:16 - 49:20)
Android devices we will be able to (49:18 - 49:23)
streamline our development process and (49:20 - 49:25)
focus resources on supporting newer (49:23 - 49:28)
operating systems and technology Android (49:25 - 49:31)
users on 64-bit devices and iOS users (49:28 - 49:32)
are not affected and do not need to take (49:31 - 49:35)
any action I think this is a big (49:32 - 49:37)
complaint with Pokemon masters because I (49:35 - 49:39)
believe Pokemon masters it's out the (49:37 - 49:41)
gate did not support 32-bit the Android (49:39 - 49:45)
device yeah I believe that's true here (49:41 - 49:47)
are some examples of 32-bit Android (49:45 - 49:49)
devices this is not the entire list this (49:47 - 49:52)
is off pokemon go live.com so if you (49:49 - 49:54)
have the following phones you will have (49:52 - 49:59)
to purchase a new phone before august to (49:54 - 50:01)
continue playing pokemon go alright if (49:59 - 50:05)
you have the samsung galaxy s4 s5 note 3 (50:01 - 50:10)
or j-3 if you have the Sony Xperia z2 or (50:05 - 50:14)
z3 if you have the motorola moto G first (50:10 - 50:18)
gen and if you have any Android device (50:14 - 50:22)
or at least before 2015 you will (50:18 - 50:24)
probably not be able to play pokemon go (50:22 - 50:26)
when this update rolls out trainers (50:24 - 50:28)
using these devices will no longer be (50:26 - 50:29)
able to access their go accounts from (50:28 - 50:31)
those devices including their coins (50:29 - 50:34)
their items you're using a 32-bit (50:31 - 50:36)
Android device you will need to a (50:34 - 50:39)
compatible 64-bit Android device or iOS (50:36 - 50:43)
device to continue playing pokemon go be (50:39 - 50:44)
sure to have your account info and (50:43 - 50:46)
passwords saved somewhere so you can log (50:44 - 50:49)
back in to your new device they do have (50:46 - 50:52)
an article to every device but I think (50:49 - 50:54)
here they just highlighted the most (50:52 - 50:58)
popular phones this is good yeah it's (50:54 - 50:59)
it's absolutely aníbal they can't (50:58 - 51:03)
maintain every mono of every phone for (50:59 - 51:04)
all eternity that just would be (51:03 - 51:07)
impossible and they don't list all the (51:04 - 51:11)
phones that help center they do have the (51:07 - 51:13)
oneplus one which I feel like is a (51:11 - 51:16)
pretty popular phone the HTC One and the (51:13 - 51:19)
over tour 3 I have not heard of that one (51:16 - 51:22)
what know what Samsung Galaxy are they (51:19 - 51:25)
on are they on like an s8 right now (51:22 - 51:30)
yeah Galaxy 9 I think okay now (51:25 - 51:33)
which was the one that blew up that was (51:30 - 51:35)
the eight that was I thought I was the (51:33 - 51:39)
note for no no no no no no it was the (51:35 - 51:41)
galaxy I think it was the eight yeah (51:39 - 51:44)
this is a thing like this has always (51:41 - 51:47)
been a thing as the person working in (51:44 - 51:49)
the telecom industry that was the note (51:47 - 51:53)
seven that blew up okay okay they get (51:49 - 51:56)
quickly tired of trying to back support (51:53 - 52:01)
the good news is generally stuff that is (51:56 - 52:06)
a couple of years old is pretty cheap to (52:01 - 52:10)
upgrade to often free because the (52:06 - 52:12)
companies involved want you to stay with (52:10 - 52:14)
them so they may have you sign a (52:12 - 52:16)
contract to get that thing for free so (52:14 - 52:17)
that you're guaranteeing service for (52:16 - 52:21)
them for two years so upgrading is made (52:17 - 52:23)
fairly easy by most phone companies (52:21 - 52:26)
because they want you to do it so check (52:23 - 52:27)
out you don't have to get the latest and (52:26 - 52:30)
greatest you can go a couple of years (52:27 - 52:31)
back and they're usually really good (52:30 - 52:33)
deals on those phones good news I guess (52:31 - 52:37)
is the Solstice event is returning again (52:33 - 52:39)
I was waiting to see what the good news (52:37 - 52:44)
was okay st. it and the bug out event we (52:39 - 52:47)
have more details so shiny Clefairy will (52:44 - 52:49)
arrive and lunatone and Solrock will be (52:47 - 52:52)

only only during the event or in the (52:56 - 52:58)
event okay (52:57 - 53:02)

incense certain bug Pokemon appearing (55:50 - 55:54)
more than other when you use your (55:52 - 55:58)
incense so same thing with the well I (55:54 - 55:59)
guess they didn't say that those would (55:58 - 56:01)
be in the lunatone Solrock are not (55:59 - 56:04)
incense but from Friday June 26 to June (56:01 - 56:06)

to round it out there will be a pincer (56:28 - 56:33)

to 2:00 local time 3 star raids (56:33 - 56:38)
featuring pincer will be more common be (56:36 - 56:41)
sure to have it your remote raid packs (56:38 - 56:44)
passes stocked now I'm just gonna go out (56:41 - 56:46)
there and do them there will be a one (56:44 - 56:50)
coin bundle featuring three remote ray (56:46 - 56:52)
passes I thought they were done with one (56:50 - 56:56)
coin bundles they were advertising leave (56:52 - 56:59)
one coin bundle oh but I'll reserve it (56:56 - 57:01)
also on mine it says 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. (56:59 - 57:04)
10:00 oh sorry I said with my man I (57:01 - 57:08)
misspoke 11 to 2 okay there's a trick (57:04 - 57:10)
with the right passes you can only hold (57:08 - 57:13)
three remote ray passes so you would not (57:10 - 57:15)
be able to buy this bundle if you have (57:13 - 57:18)
three but if you hold to remote ray (57:15 - 57:21)
passes you will be able to have you will (57:18 - 57:23)
be able to buy the bundle and you will (57:21 - 57:25)
be holding five but you can't buy it (57:23 - 57:27)
when you're holding three you have to be (57:25 - 57:29)
holding zero one or two to buy the (57:27 - 57:31)
bundle so just a heads up if you have (57:29 - 57:34)
three you're like why can't i buy this (57:31 - 57:36)
bundle you have to use at least one (57:34 - 57:39)
you're allowed to go over but you're not (57:36 - 57:41)
allowed to go over when you're at max (57:39 - 57:44)
which is three in this case though (57:41 - 57:46)
you'll be able to hold five it's very (57:44 - 57:49)
confusing just just know that that's (57:46 - 57:52)
that's the trick around it I would (57:49 - 57:54)
probably buy the the three ray passes (57:52 - 57:56)
for a coin I think that's pretty good I (57:54 - 57:59)
think that's pretty alright that's a (57:56 - 57:59)
good one (57:59 - 58:01)
I guess I didn't have this in my news (57:59 - 58:02)
but (58:01 - 58:05)
go battle league is shut down again for (58:02 - 58:08)
cheating oh those cheaters ruin (58:05 - 58:10)
everything who cheated whoever you are (58:08 - 58:13)
stopped cheating and there's no ETA of (58:10 - 58:17)
when it comes back up but there was from (58:13 - 58:18)
my understanding I didn't investigate (58:17 - 58:20)
too much into it there was a handful of (58:18 - 58:23)
people that found an exploit used the (58:20 - 58:25)
exploit they then got banned off the (58:23 - 58:28)
leaderboard because they were very very (58:25 - 58:30)
highly ranked as you know Pokemon (58:28 - 58:32)
go-live has a leaderboard feature now (58:30 - 58:35)
and then people continue to do it so (58:32 - 58:37)
then they just shut down the entire gold (58:35 - 58:40)
medal I don't know if that was a (58:37 - 58:42)
permanent ban for those people though I (58:40 - 58:44)
would assume so I feel like if you're (58:42 - 58:48)
exploiting official competition I don't (58:44 - 58:50)
see why they would have you back I know (58:48 - 58:53)
I agree last bit of news here there's a (58:50 - 58:54)
new tournament speaking of tournaments (58:53 - 58:57)
for a sword and shield it is the (58:54 - 58:58)
international friendly online (58:57 - 59:01)
competition no ball shirt this time (58:58 - 59:04)
though yeah I'm out ah Pass pass hard (59:01 - 59:07)
pass this competition will run from June (59:04 - 59:11)
25th through June 28th it will use (59:07 - 59:13)
similar rules to the championships (59:11 - 59:17)
format if you do at least one battle you (59:13 - 59:19)
will get 50 battle points pretty good (59:17 - 59:24)
that I can buy you two ability capsules (59:19 - 59:26)
I think there are 25 sounds about right (59:24 - 59:29)
you can sign up now and you can sign up (59:26 - 59:31)
anytime between June 10th through June (59:29 - 59:34)
25th same way you've signed up for any (59:31 - 59:36)
events you open sword and shield you go (59:34 - 59:38)
to the first menu battle stadium online (59:36 - 59:39)
competition search for online (59:38 - 59:42)
competition also players may receive (59:39 - 59:43)
penalties and be restricted from (59:42 - 59:45)
participating in future competitions if (59:43 - 59:48)
there is a significant large number of (59:45 - 59:50)
disconnects during the battle I guess (59:48 - 59:53)
they have not fixed that starting from (59:50 - 59:55)
when your opponent decides until the (59:53 - 59:57)
match results I've been fully sent to (59:55 - 59:58)
the server please ensure a stable (59:57 - 60:00)
connection when you are connecting to (59:58 - 60:04)
the internet I'm doing my best I think (60:00 - 60:05)
if you everyone disconnect that's (60:04 - 60:07)
probably not that big of a deal if (60:05 - 60:09)
that's my one battle that I'm using to (60:07 - 60:12)
get my points it is a big deal I want to (60:09 - 60:15)
fight somebody else I feel like if (60:12 - 60:17)
well I think you can say this for any (60:15 - 60:21)
fandom slash event slash world thing I (60:17 - 60:24)
feel like if kovat wasn't a thing (60:21 - 60:26)
Pokemon would be having a heck of a year (60:24 - 60:29)
right now yeah true yeah they would be (60:26 - 60:31)
there just really killing it with TCG (60:29 - 60:35)
stuff and and the VGC stuff was so (60:31 - 60:37)
healthy before kovat cancelled all the (60:35 - 60:39)
tournaments and they're merged they're (60:37 - 60:40)
like continuing to release new merch (60:39 - 60:43)
almost on a weekly basis in Pokemon (60:40 - 60:46)
Center anime just hit the ground for a (60:43 - 60:50)
lot of companies who are like Pokemon (60:46 - 60:55)
hit Pokemon shifted really fast like (60:50 - 60:57)
they were on it and I think I think (60:55 - 61:01)
they've at least helped stop the major (60:57 - 61:03)
impact like it's not the same but I (61:01 - 61:06)
think they pivoted faster than a lot of (61:03 - 61:08)
other companies did yeah (61:06 - 61:14)
which is weird cuz normally but I think (61:08 - 61:16)
like if you look at what they had (61:14 - 61:18)
planned for 2020 I think a lot of what (61:16 - 61:20)
they had planned for releases for (61:18 - 61:23)
products fit into our new model of (61:20 - 61:26)
living better than most companies like (61:23 - 61:28)
they had two DLCs already set up all (61:26 - 61:29)
these products to teach people how to (61:28 - 61:32)
play TCG don't require you to go to a (61:29 - 61:34)
game store to get them and like they can (61:32 - 61:38)
say hey families do this so I think all (61:34 - 61:39)
right ahead (61:38 - 61:42)
they were primed to be able to change (61:39 - 61:44)
base off of what they had already (61:42 - 61:46)
planned for 2020 this is the first (61:44 - 61:48)
attempt at DLC I hope it's good (61:46 - 61:50)
I I don't know at this point I'm going (61:48 - 61:53)
to be good he's going to be good I hate (61:50 - 61:54)
sword and shield and I can tell you this (61:53 - 62:01)
is gonna be good I don't know if it (61:54 - 62:04)
converts any national dexter's right (62:01 - 62:09)
like to bad trash out the door with you (62:04 - 62:10)
well I'm here with the fun folks who (62:09 - 62:13)
know how to enjoy life well we also okay (62:10 - 62:15)
so national Dexter's aside which is you (62:13 - 62:18)
know as we saw with sales a tiny tiny (62:15 - 62:21)
very tiny culture a very loud portion (62:18 - 62:23)
very tiny portion well that's how they (62:21 - 62:23)
get you (62:23 - 62:27)
we do know that our players that skip (62:23 - 62:29)
the first generation right (62:27 - 62:32)
why by why by diamond and pearl when we (62:29 - 62:34)
know that platinum would be a better (62:32 - 62:36)
version of that why by Sun and Moon when (62:34 - 62:37)
we know there's normally a third version (62:36 - 62:42)
y by x and y when oh wait um but (62:37 - 62:45)
there-there are fans that do wait (62:42 - 62:47)
because normally the the third version (62:45 - 62:50)
is the better version and you know they (62:47 - 62:52)
don't want to pay $40 for a game and (62:50 - 62:54)
then the next year pay $40 for (62:52 - 62:57)
ultimately the same game which is (62:54 - 62:59)
I I don't think anyone's arguing that (62:57 - 63:01)
the original game was ever better than (62:59 - 63:04)
the third version feature wise you can (63:01 - 63:06)
maybe argue that the story is better so (63:04 - 63:09)
I'm really really curious if you know (63:06 - 63:11)
this DLC comes out it has you know (63:09 - 63:13)
bouffalant in it somebody's favorite (63:11 - 63:15)
Pokemon all-time is booth Alliant they (63:13 - 63:17)
see boo Flint's walking around the wild (63:15 - 63:20)
they were really unsure because of (63:17 - 63:22)
national Dexter's that they wanted to (63:20 - 63:24)
buy the game if they're going to (63:22 - 63:27)
purchase it and purchase the DLC and (63:24 - 63:29)
enjoy it you know there's probably (63:27 - 63:31)
another audience that heard that there's (63:29 - 63:32)
not anything to do once you beat the (63:31 - 63:34)
game so it's not worth the 60 bucks (63:32 - 63:36)
is this going to add enough where they (63:34 - 63:40)
feel compelled to buy it go through beat (63:36 - 63:44)
Leon then explore everything that there (63:40 - 63:48)
is to offer it's a really exciting but (63:44 - 63:50)
like nerve-wracking time and see if this (63:48 - 63:53)
is going to do what they wanted to do I (63:50 - 63:55)
mean I don't think that if they were (63:53 - 63:57)
unwilling to spend $60 that they're now (63:55 - 64:00)
willing to spend $90 exactly yes like (63:57 - 64:02)
those people are those people aren't (64:00 - 64:05)
coming back I think some national (64:02 - 64:09)
Dexter's will like will say oh we'll use (64:05 - 64:12)
the addition of pokeman as an excuse to (64:09 - 64:13)
do what they wanted to do all along (64:12 - 64:17)
let's play the game I think it gives (64:13 - 64:19)
them a way in to say oh well now more (64:17 - 64:21)
coming back and they've shown up up up (64:19 - 64:21)
up ah (64:21 - 64:23)
and they can say is my point still (64:21 - 64:24)
stands but I'm gonna try the game now I (64:23 - 64:27)
still think that was such a small amount (64:24 - 64:29)
of people I think the bigger concern is (64:27 - 64:33)
how these go right like if the DLCs (64:29 - 64:35)
ultimately Ares like we're very (64:33 - 64:38)
dissatisfied with both DLCs and this (64:35 - 64:40)
would be really hard if this first one (64:38 - 64:44)
doesn't at least shine for people to (64:40 - 64:46)
think I want to come back for the second (64:44 - 64:48)
one so like there's a lot that sort of (64:46 - 64:50)
rides on this first one that I'm hoping (64:48 - 64:54)
they put a lot enough in that people are (64:50 - 64:57)
enthused to wait for the next one in (64:54 - 64:59)
November and I've said this in the past (64:57 - 65:01)
too I think I think I was very vocal (64:59 - 65:04)
around the time of X&Y about this is (65:01 - 65:06)
like I I didn't want Pokemon to turn (65:04 - 65:09)
into like a Call of Duty or a at the (65:06 - 65:11)
time I think it was like rock band (65:09 - 65:12)
or you were getting a game every single (65:11 - 65:17)
year mm-hmm and that affects that can (65:12 - 65:19)
affect the quality of the game so (65:17 - 65:21)
because we're technically not getting a (65:19 - 65:24)
new game this year are these DLC is (65:21 - 65:25)
gonna be good enough are they gonna feel (65:24 - 65:30)
like they're worth the $30 total is it (65:25 - 65:32)
going to you know if ideally we're (65:30 - 65:36)
getting a game the fall of 2021 which I (65:32 - 65:38)
guess would be the pattern although the (65:36 - 65:40)
Pokemon company's proven their patterns (65:38 - 65:43)
are very hard to follow yeah what (65:40 - 65:46)
happens you know after November or (65:43 - 65:48)
ultimately a full year with sword and (65:46 - 65:51)
shield do we get a final DLC do we get (65:48 - 65:53)
nothing do we get I mean I think also (65:51 - 65:56)
there should be perception of you're (65:53 - 65:59)
buying two for $30 but everybody's going (65:56 - 66:01)
to judge the first one off of the full (65:59 - 66:04)
price because if it's terrible (66:01 - 66:05)
then I could probably gonna play the (66:04 - 66:07)
second one and they'll still have that (66:05 - 66:11)
perception of I paid $30 for this so I'm (66:07 - 66:14)
really I'm really hoping the deal the (66:11 - 66:17)
first DLC has a lot to it and it feels (66:14 - 66:21)
very vibrant so that you feel like oh (66:17 - 66:24)
I'm getting a lot for $30 and I get (66:21 - 66:27)
something in November I'm afraid that (66:24 - 66:30)
they may have taken the approach of a (66:27 - 66:59)
loaded with $15 and $15.63 where I did a (66:30 - 67:02)
lot of competitive so sudden mood (66:59 - 67:04)
ultramoon where did they fall for you (67:02 - 67:07)
towards the bottom I think that's like (67:04 - 67:09)
the start if when things started to go (67:07 - 67:13)
bad okay so as somebody who didn't enjoy (67:09 - 67:15)
sword and shield purchased the DLC oh (67:13 - 67:20)
heck yeah what what would be the what (67:15 - 67:22)
would put sword and shield above the (67:20 - 67:24)
games you did like like what is (67:22 - 67:28)
something that would make it feel good (67:24 - 67:31)
to you in either this this expansion or (67:28 - 67:33)
maybe hopefully in the second one like (67:31 - 67:35)
how could they redeem themselves yeah (67:33 - 67:37)
oh I think that horse has left the barn (67:35 - 67:44)
I I mean if they improve like the the (67:37 - 67:46)
main issue I I can focus on now because (67:44 - 67:49)
it's like just the thing that I'm since (67:46 - 67:51)
I'm trying to complete my pokedex much (67:49 - 67:54)
like you I I would like to have a living (67:51 - 67:56)
decks in sword and shield before I move (67:54 - 67:59)
forward the fact that there's just not (67:56 - 68:04)
not that very clear path to finding all (67:59 - 68:09)
of the Pokemon and like when I like went (68:04 - 68:10)
through my pokedex and I was like oh (68:09 - 68:12)
here's all the ones that I missing and (68:10 - 68:14)
then I went through bla bla pedia to see (68:12 - 68:16)
like oh do I have to have them traded (68:14 - 68:18)
from shield or can I find them in-game (68:16 - 68:21)
and there was like a heck Donavan that (68:18 - 68:25)
actually do exist in sword but number (68:21 - 68:28)
one prime annoyance only in the wild (68:25 - 68:30)
area that is completely aggravating to (68:28 - 68:34)
me but then number two it's just like in (68:30 - 68:36)
the wild area at certain weather (68:34 - 68:38)
conditions I'm like oh you're gonna make (68:36 - 68:42)
me just sit and wait for the weather to (68:38 - 68:46)
change to hope and a number three gripe (68:42 - 68:49)
back to back to our roots I don't know (68:46 - 68:51)
if other people notice this but if you (68:49 - 68:55)
click on the Pokedex in sword and shield (68:51 - 68:58)
it comes up with a here's the next (68:55 - 69:00)
Pokemon we think you should yeah yeah (68:58 - 69:03)
yeah sure and then when you capture that (69:00 - 69:04)
Pokemon if it's the one that your (69:03 - 69:06)
pokedex is recommending it's like (69:04 - 69:09)
pokedex completion update hooray I (69:06 - 69:14)
there are pokemon in sword in the game (69:09 - 69:16)
that i could be getting that my pokedex (69:14 - 69:19)
no long it doesn't bother to say hey you (69:16 - 69:21)
should be looking for this one it does (69:19 - 69:23)
all it says is let's find Pokemon I'm (69:21 - 69:25)
like that is so I don't want to use bad (69:23 - 69:30)
words but that is so half donkey in (69:25 - 69:34)
execution but but here's the thing (69:30 - 69:38)
I love armor I know what I took SPECT (69:34 - 69:42)
going in so I'm I will work around these (69:38 - 69:44)
limitations and shortcomings and I will (69:42 - 69:47)
enjoy myself because how refreshing to (69:44 - 69:50)
have new Pokemon content in the middle (69:47 - 69:54)
of the year you know the summer - it's (69:50 - 69:57)
just like new and it's it's actual like (69:54 - 70:00)
not a side game anything like that it's (69:57 - 70:03)
it's actual just Pokemon content and (70:00 - 70:06)
it's an extension of my Pokemon sword (70:03 - 70:09)
that is just wonderful and at that I'm (70:06 - 70:13)
very happy about I was lucky enough for (70:09 - 70:16)
a Nintendo treehouse and the Pokemon (70:13 - 70:19)
continued to invite me on a pokémon (70:16 - 70:22)
showcase this past weekend and while we (70:19 - 70:24)
were going through rehearsal they were (70:22 - 70:26)
they were asking you know what I was (70:24 - 70:28)
familiar with in Pokemon certain Pokemon (70:26 - 70:30)
shield which is everything at this point (70:28 - 70:34)
but when they were like hey are you do (70:30 - 70:35)
you want to explain the cooking session (70:34 - 70:37)
I would be like yeah I love to like I (70:35 - 70:38)
completed my curry decks like I thought (70:37 - 70:42)
that was fun and I would love to be a (70:38 - 70:45)
person to be like hey if you don't know (70:42 - 70:46)
what to do in soren shield or maybe you (70:45 - 70:48)
didn't buy it like this is a cool thing (70:46 - 70:50)
that the game has if you like collecting (70:48 - 70:52)
stuff and when I was like going through (70:50 - 70:54)
my berries it was just really funny to (70:52 - 70:56)
hear the two Nintendo treehouse (70:54 - 71:01)
employees go holy cow you have that many (70:56 - 71:05)
so and then like they wanted me to go (71:01 - 71:06)
through the competitive stuff and they (71:05 - 71:08)
were like you have 15 golden bottle caps (71:06 - 71:09)
and it's like well I've done you know (71:08 - 71:11)
master rank every season and they give (71:09 - 71:13)
you three when you hit master rank and I (71:11 - 71:16)
just I hoard a lot of items but for me (71:13 - 71:19)
it's like really exciting to go into a (71:16 - 71:24)
new area of the game with a hundred new (71:19 - 71:27)
Pokemon and like not have that feeling (71:24 - 71:30)
of well all my battle points are useless (71:27 - 71:32)
all my wats are useless all my money (71:30 - 71:33)
Zeus's cuz you're so used to in these (71:32 - 71:36)
Pokemon games going like well I gotta (71:33 - 71:40)
collect all the fire stones again and (71:36 - 71:42)
the reaper cloths and the bottle caps (71:40 - 71:46)
and it seems more it seems just to make (71:42 - 71:48)
sense with current games (71:46 - 71:50)
to be like I don't have to do this all (71:48 - 71:53)
again so I'm excited to see that area (71:50 - 71:56)
and just a heads up because I still see (71:53 - 71:59)
people say this these Pokemon are not (71:56 - 72:00)
behind a paywall (71:59 - 72:04)
if you decide not to get the expansion (72:00 - 72:05)
because you're waiting for people's (72:04 - 72:07)
thoughts on it you want to see if it's (72:05 - 72:08)
worth it (72:07 - 72:12)
etc you have to do the update that'll be (72:08 - 72:14)
for everyone the sword and shield update (72:12 - 72:18)
but once that update hits if you want a (72:14 - 72:21)
bouffalant in sword and shield not the (72:18 - 72:23)
expansion you can either move in your (72:21 - 72:24)
bouffalant (72:23 - 72:27)
from Pokemon home or somebody can trade (72:24 - 72:29)
it to you or you can get it wonder (72:27 - 72:32)
traded nothing restricts that bouffalant (72:29 - 72:35)
in the expansion from you having it in (72:32 - 72:36)
the game you don't have to pay for (72:35 - 72:40)
anything also if somebody is doing a (72:36 - 72:43)
abyssal raid which I'm assuming will (72:40 - 72:46)
probably be a thing new pokemon in raid (72:43 - 72:50)
in the isle of armor even if you don't (72:46 - 72:53)
have the DLC you can still join and (72:50 - 72:55)
participate in that raid (72:53 - 72:58)
you just can't host the raid because (72:55 - 72:59)
obviously you're not in that area to see (72:58 - 73:01)
it but you can still join it you can (72:59 - 73:03)
still participate in it you can still (73:01 - 73:06)
catch it without paying $30 so there is (73:03 - 73:09)
no pay wall to these Pokemon unless you (73:06 - 73:12)
consider even cup foo the legendary (73:09 - 73:15)
Pokemon you get for free somebody could (73:12 - 73:17)
just trade you a cup foo and you're good (73:15 - 73:19)
you have it that's still getting thrown (73:17 - 73:21)
around that these Pokemon are behind a (73:19 - 73:22)
paywall the raids are behind the paywall (73:21 - 73:24)
none of that none of that is behind a (73:22 - 73:27)
paywall tell a friend I guess I don't (73:24 - 73:32)
know I think that's all we have for news (73:27 - 73:34)
let me just check the attic channel (73:32 - 73:36)
shout out to James for sending in the (73:34 - 73:40)
five million dollar donation Brandon (73:36 - 73:42)
with the reminder of the ghoul Aryan (73:40 - 73:44)
Meowth mystery gift (73:42 - 73:47)
Greg will do our question of the week (73:44 - 73:51)
question of the week we've got all the (73:47 - 73:53)
answers you seek (73:51 - 73:58)
yeah question of the week come on (73:53 - 74:00)
everybody and sing (73:58 - 74:04)
yeah I mean that's nice mm-hmm (74:00 - 74:07)
this is from Robert says if you have a (74:04 - 74:09)
chance to make a minigame for a (74:07 - 74:12)
pokémon's if you haven't 30 what would (74:09 - 74:14)
it go No (74:12 - 74:18)
oh yeah oh I hmm (74:14 - 74:20)
what has already been done what has (74:18 - 74:22)
already been done all right well you (74:20 - 74:23)
guys think about that (74:22 - 74:26)
there there was there was an interview I (74:23 - 74:28)
think it was in Eurogamer like three or (74:26 - 74:30)
four years ago and it was something (74:28 - 74:32)
along the lines of like would you make a (74:30 - 74:33)
pokemon stadium three these are always (74:32 - 74:35)
the questions would you make a Pokemon (74:33 - 74:37)
snap would you make a pokemon stadium (74:35 - 74:39)
three and they said the reason they they (74:37 - 74:41)
don't feel like they need to make a (74:39 - 74:43)
pokemon stadium three is because pokemon (74:41 - 74:48)
stadium was the way to see your 2d (74:43 - 74:52)
Pokemon in 3d right and because of X&Y (74:48 - 74:54)
they don't have to do that anymore but (74:52 - 74:58)
nostalgia is strong it is strong at this (74:54 - 75:02)
one and I would love a minigame (74:58 - 75:06)
collection and there are new Pokemon to (75:02 - 75:08)
make minigames around that's true that's (75:06 - 75:12)
true I think I mean III want here here (75:08 - 75:16)
you go ready idea number one golden drag (75:12 - 75:20)
a pole target-shooting throw those (75:16 - 75:24)
Droopys at the target yes get both darts (75:20 - 75:24)
uh-huh viral ball fetch okay all right (75:24 - 75:30)
you could have a you could have a mini (75:29 - 75:33)
game where booth lamp gets doused by (75:30 - 75:35)
water and you got a brush out its afro (75:33 - 75:43)
how boring fast no in Packham oh yeah (75:35 - 75:47)
smack the wind pod because it's always (75:43 - 75:50)
trying to run away from you I still (75:47 - 75:53)
think there's a market one for mini (75:50 - 75:56)
games Pokemon minigames but two I still (75:53 - 75:57)
think there's a market and they could (75:56 - 75:58)
probably just do this in certain chill (75:57 - 75:59)
they probably don't have to make a third (75:58 - 76:02)
version but it would be cool if there (75:59 - 76:04)
was an app or a game where you could (76:02 - 76:08)
just watch people battle I open up the (76:04 - 76:10)
app it's called twitch yeah I guess yeah (76:08 - 76:15)
it's called to itch I guess but clash (76:10 - 76:17)
Royale had this and I think it was good (76:15 - 76:19)
I mean clash Royale not the pinnacle of (76:17 - 76:22)
gaming here no when Greg was doing a (76:19 - 76:24)
battle in clash Royale it was very cool (76:22 - 76:26)
to join it and watch it and then you (76:24 - 76:28)
could like cheer from the side it was (76:26 - 76:31)
yes it's cool and you know if you are (76:28 - 76:35)
somebody who can't go to twitch or don't (76:31 - 76:37)
want to deal with chat or commentary (76:35 - 76:41)
that was like a cool thing well okay (76:37 - 76:42)
let's talk about twitch like twitch (76:41 - 76:46)
plays pokemon have sometimes they have (76:42 - 76:48)
like just pokémon battle revolution (76:46 - 76:51)
battles and it's just kind of fun to (76:48 - 76:55)
watch the computer randomly battle each (76:51 - 76:58)
other and be like oh I think the team (76:55 - 77:00)
with the Latios and the Clefairy is (76:58 - 77:02)
gonna beat the team with the right (77:00 - 77:04)
earier and the Sandile (77:02 - 77:07)
but I yeah I don't I don't I mean (77:04 - 77:09)
probably based off battle Revolution (77:07 - 77:11)
sales alone I don't know if there's an (77:09 - 77:15)
actual market for that but spectating (77:11 - 77:17)
and watching battles as seen on twitch (77:15 - 77:19)
is definitely there's definitely a (77:17 - 77:21)
demand for that I don't know pokemon (77:19 - 77:23)
stadium was like a full package though (77:21 - 77:28)
it had like your free battles yep it had (77:23 - 77:31)
the Gameboy player (77:28 - 77:33)
had minigames it had the gym leader (77:31 - 77:37)
tower it had a way to unlock surfing (77:33 - 77:41)
Pikachu it was pretty fleshed out yeah (77:37 - 77:43)
Stadium 2 was the same thing but in like (77:41 - 77:45)
this literally the same areas but just (77:43 - 77:47)

if you're not a fan of Jay Z and Rick (77:58 - 78:03)
Rubin maybe you missed it I thought I (78:00 - 78:05)
put enough words in there that would (78:03 - 78:10)
make make it clear I think the number (78:05 - 78:12)
one clue which most people may have (78:10 - 78:16)
missed out on is the number 99 but I (78:12 - 78:18)
also mentioned things like having a (78:16 - 78:22)
Crabby mood I also had like moves like (78:18 - 78:26)
crabhammer razor shell and guillotine (78:22 - 78:31)
that it's basically a mana water type (78:26 - 78:33)
what more do you need (78:31 - 78:41)

st. kingler Singler that's a very (79:02 - 79:11)
Minnesota thing yeah good shuffle icon (79:07 - 79:13)
Hinkler shares the same category with (79:11 - 79:15)
scissors they're both known as the (79:13 - 79:17)
pincer Pokemon (79:15 - 79:20)

that's magic and witchcraft to me at (80:04 - 80:10)
least is not like every gligar where (80:08 - 80:14)

Greg Greg possibly not oh I'm I'm I'm I (80:45 - 80:55)
am taking advantage of the huge rifts in (80:52 - 80:57)
our community this week for my own (80:55 - 80:59)
personal entertainment as the cruel (80:57 - 81:03)
human that I am would be wanted to do (80:59 - 81:04)
here we go (81:03 - 81:06)
some cards will never stand a chance (81:04 - 81:09)
there is just nothing they can do to (81:06 - 81:12)
become someone's favorite card think (81:09 - 81:14)
about Pokemon that have to be evolved in (81:12 - 81:18)
game especially stage twos there used to (81:14 - 81:21)
be a card in the game rare candy that (81:18 - 81:22)
allowed you to bypass stage one (81:21 - 81:26)
completely this week's Pokemon was most (81:22 - 81:28)
recently featured in the Sun and Moon (81:26 - 81:31)
ultra prism set which came out in (81:28 - 81:34)
English on February 2nd 2018 it has a (81:31 - 81:38)
single attack for one fire energy super (81:34 - 81:40)
singe (81:38 - 81:42)
attacked us 20 damage and inflicts the (81:40 - 81:45)
burned special condition when a Pokemon (81:42 - 81:47)
receives this special condition in the (81:45 - 81:50)
TCG the burned pokemon takes two damage (81:47 - 81:53)
at the start of each turn then the (81:50 - 81:56)
player who has that as their pokemon (81:53 - 81:58)
flips a coin to see if they are cured or (81:56 - 82:01)
whether the burned condition continues (81:58 - 82:04)
the cards flavor text reads it uses (82:01 - 82:06)
ceilings and walls to launch aerial (82:04 - 82:10)
attacks its fiery tail is but one weapon (82:06 - 82:13)
I do wish to be clear that the text does (82:10 - 82:16)
not state that its tail is one but (82:13 - 82:18)
weapon although that would be not being (82:16 - 82:22)
correct if you do succeed in evolving (82:18 - 82:24)
this week's Pokemon into its stage to (82:22 - 82:27)
form it will gain the ability flaming (82:24 - 82:30)
