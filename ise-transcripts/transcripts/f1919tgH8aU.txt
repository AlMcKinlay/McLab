[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 250 ninth episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective i am your host SBJ and with me today i have Travis I'm really thrown off because I don't think any of the podcasts that I do record it on the day that they usually record so everything just feels wrong including this one yeah yeah we're doing this on my Thursday night as I said like four days ago i'm having company over so i won't have time to record or whatnot house I've will with us today are you sure it's me because obviously I'm a liar that's true even though you can look at your iphone and tell exactly where on earth I am I'm a liar I'm not in Virginia I did I didn't think of it at the time how was Virginia that's fine i was playing vanguard i lost every match it's not the end of the world wait you're is your how this is a dumb question how long does it take for you to get to virginia are you just going to like the border and like making it some big deal of going to another state because if i say i'm going to illinois that takes me at least an hour to get there okay for me to get to maryland is about in eight minute drive for me to get to virginia is maybe like a 10 minute drive off see but to get to where i was going in virginia it was a 45-minute Drive okay 45 minutes play some Vanguard yes all right let's just let the cat out of the bag I don't know why that's why is that an expression who's putting cats and begs I think it was the expression to imply something that is irreversible right like you can't put a cat back in a bag that would be ridiculous to try to cats out the bag hands out of the bag first you skin they don't I don't need yours I don't even hear you're like a Dartmouth methodology if be if the open within my way to skin a cat big enough yeah it would be very easy okay so by the time this goes up which is you know monday more everyone morning but like a week 0 from now by the time this goes up the newest season of mythical will be out on itunes under the whole mythical podcast RSS feed which is separate then it's super effective this has been we we recorded this season and another episode of that's it that's all your news that's everything no housecleaning see you later so over the past couple months people like these people like Travis and these people like Micah and all these other people have mentioned that there was these secret projects that I wouldn't let them talk about that and I think I think it's okay to talk about that now now that we have we have something tangible to give to people because of that right we all got together first week in december in wisconsin and we recorded a bunch of audio which includes the season of mythical that again by the time you hear this will be out in iTunes and on soundcloud and and on google play and we we recorded more audio besides that but right now there's a full season of mythical it is three episodes long it is about two hours give or take and it is a complete story and it doesn't you don't need to listen to any other season to follow along I think that's fair to yeah I mean it's a it's a prequel so it's takes place it went stant who is he's I don't remember how old stant is in the present day of mythical but he's an old older man and this takes place when Stan willow the character that Logan plays in mythical was in high school so it's a and we used the we didn't use DMD this time we use the role playing game fiasco which is much more improvisational and there's no dia more GM it's all collaborative so it was a a more sort of impromptu experience and I think it ended up being the funniest thing we've ever recorded so so I think Logan did mention that it's 44 years before whatever dungeons and dragon i'ts yeah I don't I don't think that matters too much like I don't want it I don't want it to sound more complicated than it is because like Travis mentions dance and it's like why don't know Stan so maybe it is don't don't but yeah you don't you don't need to know because it's a prequel all of this happens like you know there's not any any effects that you won't know the cause of right because it's just in the same way that you could basically look at any story from the earliest moment of it and be fine like you you could watch Star Wars Episode one before episode 4 and not really miss anything same with this it doesn't really matter where you start you can start an episode 1 of mythical or you could start right here with what do we call init schoolyards and slowpoke schools and schools and slow pokes yeah yeah yeah yeah but people there there I mean for people who are already fans of the series right there's there's character appearances that yes maybe people would know and stand is a main character but you don't have to know those characters going in right to have some and and just like most role-playing games i would say that like the characters that are being played or pretty over personified like it's very eat i don't know if that's the right word it's very easy to like kind of understand what kind of character they are pretty quickly because they're actually in this season i would say because they're all high school students so they are caricatures the other thing i want wanted to mention is what Travis said which is this isn't a game of D&D this is gamma fiasco and mythical is not there to teach you how to play Fiasco or really how to teach you how to play D&D I think in in the first couple seasons there would be characters like me or Jeff or somebody with that would ask questions and I think those questions were valuable to the listener especially for people who are like I have never played the d so i don't know if i should listen to this but in fiasco you guys don't really explain the rules but you and and I did cut out some of the rules just because they were there were either very specific questions that maybe Irene had that only evolved that only mattered in like a very specific situation they weren't like general rules right so I tried to keep general rules in without there's like weird balance of making sure that as a listener even if you've never played fiasco the core system makes sense but there's also this balance of making sure there's not so many rules that would be not really that much helpful to a listener anyways that would that would bog it down and make it sound boring when you listen to episode 1 and the first 22 minutes or quote unquote rules it's really not rules it's more of this is my character this is my personality this is how my character knows this character and this is what my characters goal is for this season and I think that lays it out pretty well while you might not get while you might not walk away understanding how to play Fiasco with your friends I think you walk away understanding I know the characters I know what the characters intentions are and I also know what the characters final goal is did I say that okay yeah I think it's a perfect way to sum up fiasco am I allowed to and you can cut this out am I allowed to say the other thing we did there because at when we are in when we're all recording together because when we're at the dells because I know when listeners are going to hear a three-episode season you know that mythical has been non-existent for so long and he hit us back with only three episodes like part of me wants to say no you talk you can talk about it yeah so the fiasco game that we played was just intended to be a silly little one off that we would put in the feed for april fools day and just because it's a sillier game and it was a the specific setting we decided of Stan's high school experience was silly enough itself that it was just going to be a silly little thing to throw in the fee as we were playing it we realized it was one of the most fun things we've done so it kind of ballooned into its own thing but that wasn't the main reason we were at the dells to record that that was just a side thing we were doing we recorded a full additional season of mythical that's your that's closer to the length of seasons one and two and it's not a silly high school story I mean it's still silly because its mythical but it's it is a continuation of the stories from season one and two so anyone who's hearing us say oh no just three episodes after waiting this long like there is a full season coming it's just a bear of an edit for Steve I always envisioned mythical being like two seasons a year and i believe on april first it will be exactly five months since a previous mythical came out and to pull back the curtain a little bit when i gave logan and micah and Travis and Greg and Irene those are your remain people in in this new season I gave them all the tools to record and I and and they recorded and when I was listening and I was with my friend Kay was there shout out to K where we're sitting on the other side of the the curtain the recording curtain listening and we both look at each other and go this isn't going to work this is possibly the worst thing I've ever heard I I think I was coming from like an audio perspective right everyone talking into a microphone is hard I think Travis is really good at peaking microphones Logan is really good and welcome at losing microphones and just pretending they don't exist micah is really good at mumbling Greg is really good at that doing that's like that's before he talks and Irene is really good at not staying on conversation so everyone has all these problems that that you know when i'm the one out when I'm listening to this and when I when I'm thinking about okay how do I straw sure the show how can i salvaged the you know three hours they're sitting down here recording I was like there's no way this is going to work I let that audio sit for like a month or so before I even looked at it and when I looked at it I was like oh like this isn't look this isn't as bad as I thought I don't want to spoil the show but there is a little bit of singing in it and a little bit I thought during these these scenes of when these characters are singing I was like there's no way that like this is going to sound good and post and it actually did turn out sounding really okay I get you know three hours of audio and you know I ended I ended up finishing I was joking in slack right because i told i told everyone eight like it took me 15 hours to produce two hours of content and Logan I love him to death was like well I could I could have done that work and saved you 15 hours like I'm a huge control freak and I was like but if you dis is very very true very true but if you did the work I don't think it would sound as good as it sounds that's no that's that's no offense to you but like I want I always want to put out a product that sounds better than anything I put out in the past right like I don't want to go I don't want to put out season mythical and go yes it's okay it's not as good as last season I always want the season to be the best season and honestly this season of mythical and we're going to play like we're gonna play like a two-minute clip here in a second I honestly believe that this season of mythical is probably the best thing I've ever produced sound wise and musical wise and and just how that season flows and I'm really really just proud of everyone who is on that because we you know without without them I don't think it would be as funny I don't think it would be as creative I just really want to encourage people like I'd honestly think this is one of the best things that this team is done I don't want our listeners to be turned off because it's maybe something they're unfamiliar with I think it's just a really cute / good / short story that feels complete hopefully at the end of the day you walk away from it thinking like that was funny right can I say one more thing that might interest people about it yeah the way that we have included Pokemon in the past and mythical is to have in when we played the DMD seasons and mythical was to say there's one class in the game that can have pokemon pals and a lot of the encounters you'll fight are going to be against poke one but that doesn't really fit for Fiasco because it's not the kind of game where you fight things so what we decided to do instead was have our human characters be named after and had their personalities reflect Pokemon so for example Irene's character is her last name is Lopes because she's like a slowpoke and she speaks very slowly so all of the characters are named after pokemon like my character is named vanille after vet nail oxen vanille is very nervous and unsure all of the time which I took from which might seem a weird thing for vanilluxe but I took that from the fact that vanilluxe has multiple heads which I feel like would be a Pokemon that have a difficult time making decisions so that's sort of what vanille is like so so it's sort of a different take on including Pokemon and I think people might find that interesting of like what's the human version of grand mole which you'll see from Micah's character bowl gran Burke what we'll do now is we'll play a quick two-minute clip to you know pique your interest and we'll be right back [Music] hey so um spent a few days what are you thinking about the looking woman you know I've thought about it yeah long and ha we're gonna do it yeah but it's mine [Music] what not like I wrote it and being around the question is this vanille seem mm-hmm okay oh I won't everybody to know that that everybody windmill slammed a black guy on two Vanilla's hat I things have suddenly become so much clearer to me now doh I don't it things are out the skated over here I what I mean like song I wrote do you want it to get airtime on oh yeah only way I can see this moving forward is if I'm singing it yeah but believe me I I'm very grateful for the song you're welcome this is a disaster the the perp the purpose of a fiasco game is that nobody gets what they want [Music] alright and we are back so if you if you thought that was funny and you want to hear more you can go to mythical podcast calm or just search for mythical and iTunes or Google Play and you'll be able to find the season and check it out I do want to stress that there are there are four seasons of mythical right now there's one 1.52 and 2.5 the point fives are just so you know the shorter seasons I do want to stress that you can start at any season they're designed in a way to be a story from start to finish so don't think you have to listen to season one and two before you get to this new one or what not like you can start at season 1.5 that's going to be an experience from start to finish and if you go and do listen to other seasons you'll start to get references and kind of see how it fits into an overall story so that's kind of our goal there but with that being said let's jump into some news global mission now live hatch a lot of eggs runs until April 10th the fifth global mission for Pokemon Sun and Moon is now live in this global mission players have to hatch Pokemon eggs if all players will worldwide hatch at least 200,000 eggs all participants will receive two thousand festival coins if the goal is not met they will receive two hundred festival coins additionally if all players worldwide hatch a total of four hundred thousand eggs participants who have registered their game sick ID at Polk mountain global link will receive a love ball and that's pretty much it make sure you talk to the global mission receptionist in the festival plaza to enter hatch as many eggs as possible before April 10th and I think will has an update on on the progress of this global mission hi it's already been met hahaha once again you don't have to do anything you don't have to hatch neg yourself they they've already met the goal and you can just sign up for it and get the prize millennial love it rise for luck with nothing are they at the forty four hundred thousand or they just hit the main goal right now uh I was looking for that and I don't know if they've gotten that far yet I dunno they hit the 200,000 but i don't know i mean i guess 400,000 yet i guess the only difference is you're gonna love ball it's not like I i I'm pretty sure that with the speed that they hit the 200,000 they will hit the 400,000 so okay that's not a good it's love ball one of the pokeballs that you only get one of in your normal single-player playthrough of the game I feel like we always ask this on an episode and it's dead it's not a very easy thing to just look up and then someone on Twitter full yeah well you're right all right it's the spell short balls that they they have restricted on us that makes no sense but ok what do you mean it makes no sense like why restrict the balls like why I only have one heavy ball and sun and moon that I'm with you Sam Sam Sun out gives you at the top of a mountain because it makes it that much more special whatever Pokemon you put in it I don't really think so because like yeah cuz you just put a ditto in it right and then the ditto passes that ball along now now the ditto ball is not passed down it's the other pokémons ball that's passed down really i thought in like X&Y it was like females passed on the ball but in sun and moon they switched it to males passed on the ball no but did oh it did oh never passes down because this is this is the way that I work I was catching a ditto for one of our listeners so that they'd have an easier time breeding a bros for synchronizers and I was like well let me make this a special treat I'll use my master ball to catch the ditto so master ball will be passed down at all that meant that anything they catch will be in a minister ball and after I did that then i looked up whether the ditto ball gets passed down and not only do master balls not get passed down but the ditto ball does not get passed out at all okay that's good to know why don't you are pokemon breeding sideshow the ditto ball i'm your host Travis wheeler I do the master balls and get passed down but that's good to know I think this is the first time I've ever used a master also it's a really special occasion I always wanted to save my master ball for like a shiny Voltorb or shiny Geodude like something that would explode right but hey I don't ever need to find a shiny that's I'll never have and will with that attitude that's right I 2017 international challenge April tournament announced the April tournament has been announced players can register between April nineteenth through April 27th the competition will run between April twenty-eighth and April thirtieth rankings will be announced sometime in May all participants will receive a sceptile light and a blazing tonight and I think also looks like an update here a Swampert tight if they win or lose three battles this tournament will use the official VGC 2017 rules Pokemon must be in the Lola pokedex and have the black clover on the summary screen zygarde cosmic calls mom so gaily olu Nala necros azum and grandma Nick Kozma and is that the is that the black looking thin black cockroach with lasers I would say is cockroach is like I like is he the one that looks like all the wires I know no one that we nice circuit that's circuitry that you're thinking yeah that something he's like the reservatrol evil he's like the really pointy one he's very add the one with sorry i did not say cockroach that was Travis's term that I just adopted did I call wait yes during the lives during the live show no no I think I called in the KRAS m'a a stealth bomber roll the tape roll right way back all we have is mythical content just put that in migire nuh cannot be used only a lowland forms with regional variants can be used mega stones are not allowed all Pokemon will be settled 50 you guys know the rest of this I just play three games lose all three you get your three mega stones that they're hiding behind these battle walls when will they learn that battle walls don't work I know walls don't do anything good pokémon go update available evolution items guaranteed for streaks new Pokemon go update will bring the version 2.5 9.1 labeled 1.2 9.1 on the iOS App Store is currently being rolled out it should be out by obviously by the time this goes up additionally players are now guaranteed to obtain a random evolution item Sunstone Kings rock dragon scale upgrade or metal coat when they obtain a seven-day first polka stop of the day streak regardless of whether they have the updates regardless of whether or not they have installed the update also they brought us minor text fixes which i think is very important I'm supplying Pokemon go every day well every day since it on a shiny magikarp gentoo no I haven't I haven't but that is news in itself thank you for bringing that up even though the water festival is now over shiny magikarp is still available to be found in the wild which I which is great because right they took away Santa Pikachu and birthday hat Pikachu and I was super super bummed the day that water festival is ending because I was like there's no way like unless I'm like the luckiest person in the world in the next five hours the shiny magikarp comes up I'm not going to be able to get one and also just from experience you can get a evolution item at any polka stop it doesn't have to be the seven-day streak I got a king's rock on a third day streak the seven-day streak just guarantees you one that's pretty much it for news that's all we got folks oh wait actually one more thing not really news but Pokemon Center is updated they have the secret plan Pikachu's that are now available these are the Pikachu's dressed like all the bad guys in the game so you can get either a Pikachu dress in a team rocket outfit Team Magma Team Aqua team galactic team plasma and team flare even though a team skull Pikachu which I personally think is the best Pikachu outfit it exists in Japan it does not exist yet ah in the American store with the licensing rights yeah it's just couldn't get the paper work to get transferred over so check that out if you want I also know that I think the previews for the next collectible figures you know those figures they released on Pokemon day I've it was Evie pikachu mew and what's that last one I don't know I have all of them because it's going to review them I haven't gotten around to it yet but the new ones i know one for sure is Jigglypuff I want to say one is like sandshrew was a weird line up but those should be coming pretty soon as well if you're into that otherwise let's take a quick break and when we come back we will read some emails and travis has a Pokemon of the week as well so we will be when I'm really excited for actually back like to like a tube with leg tubes to like tubes like a tube with leg tubes to warmers socks the phrase like it too mighty good right the phrase leg too might be like dudes leg tube with leg tubes to leg tubes like it to the flag teams to warmers well then they're just like to yes yes and we are back from our break let's do some emails so if you have any questions comments concerns emails or snail mail that actually doesn't work snail mail will not make it to my email address but if you have digital email you can send that to spj at pkmn cast com or you can just go over to Pokemon podcast com hit that contact button and that'll get you the same place we have some emails from will will you weren't here last week well for well not from well that's yeah well you know you don't know although I do email you sometimes but not for other people to hear that's cool wrightson from New Jersey oh okay i was like Cole and I talk every single day I read Cole and I talk more than you and I talk buddy so that would be real weird oh that's a bummer thought I was number one in your life you don't play Vanguard dude you also don't send him any snaps yeah neither does call ya dang i'm behind on the snapchat bandwagon ah this question is for will when i defended torterra in my last email you shot it down because you said it was asymmetrical which made it quote bad and wrong my question is this one of your favorite pokemon is kiram also a symmetrical what makes here i'm better than torterra just wondering what your rationale I could even answer I could even answer that it's it's asymmetrical for a specific design purpose the whole point of the pokemon is that it's supposed to represent a sort of shattered balance or a an emptied balance so it wouldn't make sense for it to be symmetrical I'm not will but yeah I mean I can kind of agree with that as well but also it's the fact that kiram is like made from ice and not like half rock and half tree even the way you know grass like tour Tara's top represents like a bonsai garden plant like when you great good for it kiram represents the liquid empty hole that used to be my heart like when you go to when you go to you know trader joe's I don't know where they sell these bonds I should have you ever been to a trader joe you know what trader joe's is you yeah then you should organic food and stuff they got good organic food I mean you could only go to head a little bonsai pear tree you could eat the little pairs and they might be organic would you go to so when you go to Trader Joe's and you get yourself a bonsai tree it's not like that is a symmetrical plant usually the bonsai tree is either on the left or right hand side and then there's like a little sand garden on the other side that you can take a ok your little miniature rake and you can rake your uninformed number one you're talking about a Zen garden not a bonsai tree number two if you do ever come to visit me here in Washington DC I will take you to the bonsai exhibit at the National Arboretum where they actually teach you about all the principles of bonsai which one of them is is balanced and actually growing the tree in such a way in that it represents a balance of nature not an off-kilter at lopsided half who knows what's going on so no disagree and yet trader joe's cells like ninety percent is prepackaged so I like to I like Trader Joe's have you ever been to a trader joes they have we really good first off there's a trader joes on bluemound and it's right across the street from the long years where your Trader Joe's and they have really good frozen chicken and really good apple juice spice best thing that I have is bacon-flavored popcorn actually it's apple cider if it's tangy and brown wait I don't know what the saying is not a thing that's like that yeah yeah I think it's from the simpsons yeah i think it's if it's hanging around your in cider town if it's clear and yellow you got juice their fellow exactly the best thing at trader joe's is the bacon-flavored popcorn I don't think I've ever had that this is that so good there's a second question here from coal if you guys ever get back into doing less competitive Pokemon for Pokemon the week could you guys do chatot it's my favorite Pokemon and I feel like people forget about it thanks Cole from New Jersey well not this week Cole from New Jersey because I've already got I already told the people from slack a different pokemon this is josh the gimmick Pokemon uh this is the problem with Pokemon of the week because then people want people want competitive stuff so we incorporated them Pokemon the week but then we miss out on pokemon that aren't competitive is if we do something like farfetch people are like well yeah you gave me a move set but i'm still not gonna use it to never it's a never what neverending story is that we're gonna say it's a catch-22 maybe i don't think it's a really good application of that but yeah it's a catch-22 might be a good phrase to use and i love how chatot can never be a competitive Pokemon because any time by water could appear no because it's uh because of its a signature move it can never be used in competitive Pokemon yeah that's what I'm saying by law well not by law of the United States by law of the Pokemon lawmakers it's still a law in my book in my law book alright Brandon writes in from Missouri hey Pokemon podcast crew I started listening around the episode titled SBJ verse the snowstorm I can't remember what episode that is but that's where an ice that's when I started my question is mainly for will will why won't you play zelda let's take breath of the wild in the packs episode you said that there are three Game three things that game needs for you to play one you need to collect things you can collect 120 spirit orbs and Zelda to their needs be cute things there are foxes and dogs in zelda and they are very cute how cute the foxes are have stopped me from killing them for multiple food items three you need roll things you can roll boulders and you can roll up snowballs I still need an argument for number three on Fire Emblem but just you wait Travis is my favorite Thank You Brad I like how he just complains about women like chimes and have sniffing I don't and I'm the one who's the most vocal about not liking Zelda thank you brandon from Missouri so there you go will it has the three things you you look for in a game except that I will very much disagree that I I suppose potentially the only zelda game that i might say had cuteness as a possibility was wind waker cuz those are very chibi looking characters there's nothing cute about the art style of breath of the wild it's like you mean I I mean go up to I haven't played it by have you seen the gift of the person who goes up and up to the dog and then spins around and then the dog spinning around and chasing tail too mmm yes that's right that I played that you'd the foxes are really cute yet that is a cute thing that people can do look at the art style right you don't look at a Monet and you say wow those are some cute water lilies yes it's beautiful it's painted very well but it's not cute so yes we can destiny cute how is destiny q hey destiny is the aberration because it was an opportunity when I had mono to play games with my friends so I mean obviously I dropped squ like oh there's some cute outfits and destiny mmm wilwood wilwood multiple times tell me how cute his guardian looked well but yeah because I built that Guardian there's obviously like bare hands there's also like 900 core ox seeds or whatever they're called in Zelda and every time you discover one you get one of the cute little like woodland creatures that pop out and goes Wow you from me ya know there's 900 those well that's a lot to collect that's not cute to kind of cute i'm looking for other pretty cute chibi i'm looking for big anime eyes and cheeks and just like that kind of cute or or look what's your favorite of the cousins from we love Katamari no i only love the prince I'm interesting the princess is what what I most identify with so I like beyond beyond is what are you guys uh you mean one of the cousins his name beyond yeah I don't know I do the one that's sort of like Beijing as a very long neck I yeah I'm not that familiar with the cousins but I'll tell you this if you have twitter if you are some one of those people out there few left that have twitter account there is literally a twitter account that is the katamari items list and they tweet like two or three items from that you can pick up in katamari every day it's fantastic can adjust our chat it's called that the cousin is called beyond and i think the the twitter account is i think it might be called katamari items there's some weird up in the game yeah yeah there is and the descriptions of them are really like funny so and you never really pay attention to the descriptions of the individual items while you're playing the game so it's an opportunity to reflect on your past experience but I mean I don't hate Zelda my real problem with Zelda is that it's very like boring a bad well that's part of it but I and I hope and I know breath of the wild is a break away from this but it's very formulaic of you need to follow a particular path and achieve this final goal so as someone who i'm familiar with once ranted and raved about it's not really my story it's you know the story of the game and then it's a put away game once you've completed it you know you put it away and you're not as the only one who's played breath of the wild you can do whatever you on that game there is no lineage to it so but when you do whatever you want do you actually feel like you're making progress yes in any way yeah so bored let's go to the next thing settle down Travis so yeah there are there are 120 shrines every time you complete for shrines you can cash that in for a heart to increase your life or you can cash that enforced animal stamina to increase your climbing or you're running and what I did is I fully upgraded my Stan Emma first so that maxes out I think at like 40 shrine like you would have to do like 40 shrines or something like that to max it i'm off i know my i know the numbers not right you don't need to send in the correction for that but just like like 40 or 50 shrines so i threw out the 50 hours it took me to get there still had three hearts because i thought running and climbing were more important and to me the best part about the game was finding more shrines because every time you go into a shrine it's a different puzzle and they're like really short puzzles where in Zelda's before there would be dungeons and those dungeons would be multiple puzzles of like okay first you got to get the map then you got to get the compass then you got to get all the keys and eventually you get the Bosque and then you fight the boss but in breadth of the wild every time you go into a shrine you're like okay there's one goal here how do I figure that out and you can do any shrine in any order besides the first like four shrines because they teach you how to use items but after the first four strides you knew any shrine you want you'll always have all the tools to do you any shrimp any shrine it's just some might be more difficult or some you might have to come back to but just like running around and exploring those shrines I think is the best part and you can from the start of the game go besides the first four shrines because you need to get your items you go straight to ganon and Kilgannon or you can go and do the four quote-unquote dungeons and they will line up laser so when you do get again and it helps you defeat Ganon but you could literally walked again within the first hour of the game and just attempt to kill Gannon thanks for the spoilers his mission it's like once once i get all 120 shrines they they don't reset there are shrines that do reset so like there are challenged shrines where you walk in and the goal is to like defeat something in a strategic way and those risks there's something called the Blood Moon and like every 30 days in the game which i think is maybe like two hours or three hours of play time the Blood Moon comes and resets all the enemies on the map and that sounds like tedious but it's not because you're traveling so much and you can run past enemies or or like when you go into a shrine it's like okay cool those enemies that had really great weapons respond i can defeat them get those weapons but like i said there's 900 core exceeds and that's also fun because when you look at them when you go out and you look at the map and you see all of the shrines you see like these gaps on the map between shrines and you're like oh that has to be something there and they're almost always is like the thing isla i'm not a big zelda fan at all i like I've played a lot of the Zelda games and I've completed a lot of the Zelda games but I'm in the I'm in the camp where like I don't come to Zelda for the story the story is always the same you're saving Princess Zelda you're killing Gannon there's probably a master sword at some point there's probably a horse at some point you get a bow and arrow like it's the same in that aspect it's just they tell it a little differently every time which is fine I'm a big advocate of games that respect your time and I think Zelda does that really well so like if you see something the distance and you decide like I want to see I want to see what's on top of that mountain and you spend 20 minutes climbing this mountain because it's raining or or like you slipped and fell and you had to wreak lime so like when you get to that top of the mountain there will be something there and it every time I wonder what's on the other side of this hill oh cool there's something here oh I wonder what's at the end of this valley oh there's something there and whether that's a shrine or cork seed or a treasure chest or something it just feels like everything you do in Zelda is just oh there's something here and this was an experience getting to and still not interested but I do want people to note how angry Travis was and how passive I was the long con here Zelda's good Gabriel writes in and says hello spj Travis will Micah Irene Logan Greg Erin Jeff and anyone i am missing I hope not I am relatively a new listener and started listening before the Sun and Moon special and was almost immediately pulled in by the first episode of mythical your Dungeons and Dragons podcast I have listened to every week since and I have listened through all two-and-a-half seasons of mythical multiple times you got your guys's podcast always makes me laugh and I'd like to thank you for brightening up my gloomy Monday mornings anyways I have a question about your mythical podcast Wendy why did you decide to use dungeons and dragons as a tabletop game after a while listening to it to your D&D podcast I felt my own motivation to get my pokey friends together and start a campaign on my own pee goes on and says he find he found this Pokemon universe tabletop template there's a million of them out yeah yeah I'm familiar with with it's like Pokemon tabletop adventures or something like that yeah which i think is yeah and he goes the rule book is completely free and everything like that anyways thanks for reading my incredibly long email Travis is the best I cannot wait to yes on the podcast thanks Gabriel I don't know how mythical really got started I can tell you greg has fantasized of being able to play a Pokemon game D&D game set in the Pokemon universe for an incredibly long time and convinced Steve to do it on our pokemon podcast that's the part I forgot how was he able to convince me hahaha Greg can be very persuasive yeah I don't know I don't know how that came about yeah no way it was it was mostly it was mostly Greg creating a world in a universe in Indian d fifth edition I never played D&D prior to that point Logan and travis has of course I think it was just like another side project where I was okay we could turn this into a podcast I would like to do another podcast because that would that would hopefully expand the audience we might have started it before sun and moon was announced so that probably helped to like oh there's really nothing to report on I don't remember the times actually anymore but as as for like the the rules and stuff that that was all Greg and I think I don't want to speak for Greg but he was very dedicated to his own rule set and creating those rules and that universe and that story and I have a lot of respect for that there's there's just something about like creating something from scratch and then running with it as opposed to you know just finding some source material and adapting that and there's nothing there's nothing wrong with that that don't take that as like uh oh you're just using somebody you're using somebody elses system not your own but when Greg approached me with that there was like passion there I women to be a very passionate man yeah I shared a room at the dells yeah and so like when I take on a new project and I don't have a lot of time it's like okay the people on this project are as passionate as as I am so I feel like this is worth my time and I think it was like obviously people like mythical Scott writes in says hello Pokemon podcast crew and that means you to the B team I'm writing in today to simply thank you for the for all that you do to produce such an amazing podcast that puts a smile on my face each and every week you're great people with awesome personalities whom I enjoy listening to very much I especially love how honest and open you all are especially SBJ will and Travis you're incredible and appreciated I also want you to know how much I love the slack community professor El media I can never say his name and Marsha Almeida Almeida and marshmallow love there marshmallow love have been especially friendly and definitely deserve a shout out but the community as a whole is overwhelming overwhelmingly engaged and great to talk to for those who listen to the show and have been considering pledging on patreon I highly recommend it as it supports this amazing show and gives you access to an incredibly to an incredible and friendly community via slack with that said I send my warmest regards to all of you from sunny South Florida Scott aka Scott dog on slack well thank you Scott it's very nice I think this emails a little bit old but it's from Michael a low SBJ and crew have you all been watching the sun and moon anime lately if so what are your thoughts on it so far I've been loving the animation and expressions of all the characters all the characters have and the slower slice-of-life pace the show goes thanks for the podcast keep up the great work yeah i haven't seen actually i I've seen the first two episodes but also have recently decided to disconnect all cable television from my home and and I haven't fully recovered from that yet you know what I recently discovered also is that having cable television is like smoking because now that I don't have it I keep reaching for it and it's not there anymore but you did not efficient view I don't know if I want to spend the money I just I you know they really like the only thing I was watching was Pokemon um but i will say for anybody who is hasn't watched the new season yet the disney XD season keep in mind that they have shifted the focus i will very clearly say this they have shifted the focus of the program to a younger audience so we get younger that was before yes yeah um so the actions and the way that ash now acts is is geared towards a i will say five to ten year old uh audience rather than a 10 to 15 year old audience so take take that with you when you watch it and understand that's why he's so much goofier like and and it's it's just like it's become weird i think it fits his character more to that this that the changing that sorted the target audience a little bit and shifting it a little younger I think fits Who ash is better and I'm stealing this from Carly who I was watching it with but she was saying like ashes always like sort of a kind of yeli goofball and in every situation to you on this podcast in some of the like yeah yeah sure and in some of the seasons where they tried to be a little edgier or push the demographic a little higher the main character kind of felt like he didn't belong and that's not really the case here he feels goofy and he's in a really bright sunny silly world I've been watching the subtitled japanese episode so I haven't seen like the the dub but I'm almost caught up on the Japanese episodes and i will say that a bee where is incredible in the anime and I kind of like that Pokemon to start with but now I definitely like beware yeah that first interaction between ash and beware is hilarious yeah Sam rights in from Santa Clara California I've been wanting to write in for a while I'm so glad i stumbled across ISC last year I look forward to every episode and wish I knew about icic and podcast sooner or I wouldn't have dropped off during black and white and I keep trying to play black and white too but now it's been spoiled rotten by better graphics and with no nostalgia attachment I find black and to black and white too hard to play hard to play when it came out to I know it's well she was yeah can he can he give me a pointer wanted to say that Pokemon stars sounds so lame Pokemon Eclipse would be such a better name for a third game in the series I live in socal so that's what the kids call it socal and west coast doesn't get a lot of love have you guys ever thought about something like anime expo or kamikaze it maybe it's kamikaze Co mi yeah oh I got Stan Lee's Comikaze yeah yeah I get it PS i like all of you equally but Chikorita is the best starter Sam you're talking to so two of the people on this podcast live in states that everyone calls flyover States so when you say the west coast doesn't get a lot of love you're not gonna get too much sympathy from Steve and I well I mean I believe steve has been to California uh yeah and how many times have you been to New York once there you go who's getting the love here I'm you into DC I've been de I've I've visited you in DC yeah that you have but you're an East Coaster I mean you're in the eastern time zone so East Coast sure are you on a coat are you near a house I'm also yes but not are you honest you're talking about i'm on RT 0 asymmetric nope i'm on the yeah I guess I'm on Lake Michigan's East Coast you are on a coast and you are in the eastern time zone you're an East Coaster i think i am also the Western Muskegon Michigan where I live right now might be one of thinking might be I don't know there's probably some points in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan that are farther west that are in the eastern time zone but I am near the most west you can be and still be in the eastern time zone like I would absolutely go to a convention in California if that convention would would like have me right ok yeah i'll apply and get in or I think the hard part comes of what to say at a convention right because you're getting so many people that don't know you you have to put on a show that's more generalized otherwise otherwise you're not going to get an audience so that's kind of hard and it's also kind of hard to do it solo which is which was like why PAX East was so nice because because you you two were there and so it was very like when when we read those questions it wasn't just one person reading a question and then just getting that one person's opinion it was uh multiple and obviously you guys are very different when it comes to liking and disliking certain things compared to me so I think that like how black and white 2 is bad ya know will we agree there definitely oh no we don't we all agree you heard it here first all three of us black and white too bad but yeah I don't it's not bad but it is in the lower strata like it's oh good god there aren't a lot of Pokemon games I like less than a nun black and white too I resolve for 2017 not to argue about pokemon black and white to any more so yeah hahahaha fair enough I guess you're overruled I guess you're not even participating so black and white 2 is just really bad anyways to provide real content I may be going to the boosh erode grand festival in a long beach in the fourth of July around fourth of July weekend so that may be your opportunity to hang out I might do a meetup if I go there chikorita is is not that great of a starter but I'm glad it's your favorite it's no totodile I'll tell you that I liked Rick areata the totodile is so great yeah chikorita is cute just don't evolve it you know they're all fine that whole Lyons just is they're fine they're cute and fine i will do one more email also emails a little bit old but that's irrelevant Michael rights in hey guys the the only Michael from Florida writing in it's good to know i used to be from indiana and i feel like i have to include this now because we'll mention how cute boys from indiana are if you're not in indiana now the illusion is off the apple wait what wait so it's the geography of the man that makes him attractive not necess like I was assuming when I was sort of like agreeing with you it's like oh because they're like you know your typical like cornbread Midwestern like there is it look there that can be but you just mean like you only find people attractive if they are physically within a certain geography yes there's some magic to the state of Indiana that gives just a an extra polish to the gentleman that you can find there before I get to my question I wanted to weigh in on a right sure couple of things that others have wrote in about and that you have discussed licorice is gross in any form yes I cannot pick my favorite out of all of you because like a good pokemon teen you all bring something important to the table oh that was a good analogy my love for each of you is kind of like real life experience share and finally I gave Soylent a try when suj first talked about it and I can verify that it is in fact made out of people that's not true I've been listening to the show since I found the podcast right before the release of x and y I was a mailman at the time I had plenty of time to listen at work and it quickly went back and listened to everything available and haven't stopped since I wanted to ask if any of you have bought the pokemon gold plus and used it yet I know SBJ and will have the Apple watch but I wasn't sure if anyone had experience with the plus at all I was going to purchase one but so far the reviews made it seem so far the reviews i've seen made it look a little less than worth the retail price and if i want and if i wanted to waste $35 on something disappointed I've pay for dinner on a tinder date uh one last thing just for fun if any of you have that has formed into a Pokemon that's not a legendary for the rest of time which would you choose nothing to do with battling or games yeah just which Pokemon would you want to live out for the rest of your days I would definitely pick a cute water pokemon like corsola or star me so I could just be cute and swim around underwater forever no way too many scary things underwater I wrote me anyways thank you so much for making the show and bringing this community mount to my life the show has never let me down and always managed to make me laugh brighten up my bad days and it's keep me informed and in the know and gives me something to be excited about every week thank you guys from the bottom of my heart for doing the show and being as awesome as you all are Michael thank you Michael as I know who this Michael is nicely now I there's only one Michael I know who was a male person from Indiana who no longer lives in indiana so there you go hmm no legendaries trying to think of what pokemon is the most humanoid so i can just still be a human uh-oh jam I'll just still be a person it's it's so tough if you can't yet lie because I'd want to be Victini but mmm you have a go Steve if I was to pick which Pokemon I would be mmm it would probably be Kyle a head to have to be like a flying Pokemon then I can go around quickly that was gonna be my stool or somebody would levitate oh that's a good one too like Alec I was gonna I was gonna say haunch crow because I mentioned it before that I really like haunch crow and I can fly which would be a really fun thing to do rolling with the hunch rolling with the hunch mmm i'd probably say pijat that's a safe bet it's a strong bird Pokemon because if I was like a talonflame I'd have to worry about being in a tree and catching the tree on fire mmm I'm having a really hard time with this what's the big beldam called wrong song no yeah my bronzong you talking about bronzer bronzing has nothing to do with Bill dumb beldam metagross metagross that I'll be a metagross there you go they're real smart they float around they got psychic powers and their steel type if I can't be a legend Terry let me be a metagross put that on my tombstone ah going back to the Pokemon goplus to answer that question I have it I've had it since day one whenever it came out I know it's not worth the $35 it somehow burned through a hundred of my pokeballs in 20 minutes and caught only four things and it definitely worked at one point in time but then it stopped working here's the problem with Pokemon go plus it only works in a situation like it works the best in a situation where you know you're not going to be looking at your phone and you're walking so for like me I'm never walking like I walk two minutes to my car I get into my car i drive to work which is a half hour and then I sit in my office for seven hours and then I go home and I don't leave my house so in situations where i was walking like i'm going to the mall uh and i'm gonna do some shopping i would have my phone out anyways because the mall has polka stops and pokemon and that is a like yes i'm walking but that's also an opportunity for me put to play pokemon go so why would I turn on the the device when like a benefit of going to the mall is to play pokemon go especially like Wisconsin where it's freezing outside so the only time I can really play pokemon Go Go is at a place that's indoor and has polka stops and that's the same as going to like a park like I'm going to a park I know I'm going to be doing a lot of walking but i also know because it's a park there's gonna be a bunch of polka stops and i'm going to spin those and i'm going to call it the pokemon because the problem not if the Milwaukee Council has its way that Milwaukee has anything to say about it I have never seen the Pokemon go plus catch anything rare like it's really good at getting piggies and rats has and zoo bats and drowsies but I've never seen it catch like a pidgeotto or a Kadabra or just like I'm not saying it needs to catch a Charizard it doesn't and maybe I'm wrong about that but like I don't know it just like it just seems like every situation where you would be like okay I'm going to go for a walk and I'm going to turn on this pokemon google+ at the same time like you're going for a walk and especially if you're by yourself you're probably going to have your phone out anyways if you're really into Pokemon go you're going to have your phone out to play pokemon go because you know you're walking in a situation where you can play pokemon go like the only way it would benefit you is if you're like really in the hatching eggs and you're not interested in catching pokemon and spinning stops like that like the device will spin stops for you and we'll catch like basic pokemon if you're in an area and you're like you can pretty but pretty quickly figure out how many stops are in an area just by loading the app up once and you would have to do that anyways to start the to start the device i don't think it's worth it but i've tried to save you $35 probably better off to spending thirty five dollars on incubators yeah I'd say yeah if it does you want to be able to hatch Pokemon better just by a map that am i buy more occupation of incubators but you know I name is Michael consolidate five dollars to take me on a date okay that's be disappointed it's a better better better use of the 35 hours where you messin you can buy some sick clothes and Pokemon go that doesn't do anything except make you look stylish certainly doesn't cover your ankles that's right that's that's absolutely true oh yeah all you got our leg tubes well that'll wrap it up for emails if you want to send in any emails let me know by sending in those emails SBJ at pkmn cast com or Pokemon podcast calm / contact travis once you give us our pokemon of the week oh I am really excited for this because a Pokemon of the week is drifblim I'm excited for this for more than one reason first drifblim is just really cool I've always liked the Pokemon it was on the terrible awful unequivocally objectively terrible featured team that I submitted wet way back before I was on the show when I was just a rabid fan I included drifblim because I love drifblim very good very cool very awesome second what is happening with drifblim right now is one of the things that makes competitive Pokemon interesting to me which is when out of nowhere kind of people realize oh wait this pokemon that no one is using actually might be good and to give you an example according to smog ins raid smog ons usage statistics in January drifblim was on point zero four percent of teams though not a lot of usage as of februari 2017 drifblim is on 4.0 four percent of teams so that's an increase of over 1,000 percent and you might be thinking what happened why the big change a new item in well a new set of items rather in Pokemon Sun and Moon are the terrain seeds so there's like electric seed misty seed psychic seed grassy seed I think they we talked about this last week yeah so you're sending a Pokemon and well I guess anytime the terrain changes to electric misty grassy psychic depending on which of the seeds you're using terrain then that seed will be consumed it will increase one of the stats of it'll in the case of like Miss teacher I think they might all increase their defense actually the defense of that pokemon x one stage all of these items Electric seed grassy seed etc increase the defense of the holder and then they're consumed when the respective terrain is activated and you might be hearing that and thinking what on earth does this have to do with drifblim well one of drift limbs abilities is the ability unburden there's an ability where its speed is doubled once if it at one point had a held item but then that held item was either consumed or taken away from it it's not there anymore so it can't be like you just don't send it in with an item this ability only activates if it had an item and it was either taken away or consumed its speed will be doubled so not only this drifblim come in with a boost to its defense it also has twice the speed it would normally have it has access to some pretty powerful support moves stuff like tailwind will-o'-wisp uh and then it you can do cheesy stuff with like acrobatics because you don't have an item anymore so acrobatics power is increased a lot and it just ends up being pretty good and people it took a while for people to realize that I think mostly just because these items are new and you know takes a while for people to realize really how to utilize it a new item so with all that in mind let's go to our slack channel and see what sets people came up with looks like we've got three the first one from Gabe Brown is close to the set I was just describing earlier this is either psychic seed or misty seed depending on if you are going to be pairing this with top boot lele for psychic terrain or top of Finney for misty terrain the ability is going to unburden the v's are going to be 252 and HP 252 and special defense and 8 and defense with a sassy nature your moves are going to be acrobatics tailwind Shadow Ball and then either protect or disabled I like protect just because protect is very good in doubles and I think I basically already described this tailwind is just incredible at increasing the speed of your team and just being generally supportive acrobatics is going to deal a lot of damage because you don't have an item because you've already consumed your psychic or misty seed even though you're defensively invested he can still deal some damage Shadow Ball is just there because it's a ghost same type attack bonus move and then protect and disabled or other just generally good moves the other two sets are fairly similar and they're actually the oh sorry I guess there's only 10 so we do have a variant that's very similar from Kevin soria frequent that all the actually all these folks today are pretty frequent Pokemon of the contributors so that's the same thing but it's drifblim with citrus Barry can be good too it is more difficult to guarantee you're going to lose your item than it is with one of the seeds so it's not doesn't get as much usage but it's still it's still fun and then basically the same set Shadow Ball tailwind disabled and willow wisp swapping out the acrobatics for willow wisp there and then the third set is coming from Casey Ross and this is the one that's different this is this uses the ability flare boost which is an ability I think it's the hidden ability of drifblim which increases the Special Attack of a Pokemon when it's burned and so flame orb is the item here to make it burned and then the EVs are 8 and HP 248 and special attack and 252 and speed with a modest nature you'll notice this is a distinctly offensive drifblim thunder wave hacks thunderbolt and tailwind just because even though it your this one is more offensive tailwind is still just very good so those are the three sets I love it when a pokemon comes out of nowhere to be on people's teams that it wouldn't have otherwise this drifblim example is just a perfect example of that because it took people kind of this long to figure out oh yeah unburden is a thing all done oh yeah sorry he was just caught up in that drifblim wisp wistfulness yeah I was being taken away by drifblim which isn't a very good thing to have happened to you if you read the pokedex oh that's triple and more specifically but you know shiny drifblim is yellow with blue highlights instead of being purple with yellow highlights one of the one of the better shiny is really really cool some trivia here drifblim has the highest HP based at of all flying types and is tied with garrett ena for the highest HP based step of base stat of all ghost-type pokémon drift limandri flume are the only pokemon not introduced in the Hoenn region to be found in the fluctuating perience group I don't know what that is fluctuating fluctuating that anger doesn't say egg plus you fluctuating oh here we go I think I know at this there's no this is it's not like I can click on I think I know what this is so different pokemon have pool boy am i thinking of something else it might be the rate at which all right as you look it up I'll do some housecleaning real quick we will be doing a reddit this comes out on Monday so this might be cutting it close but you made it through this episode and it's still some time on Monday will be all three of us will be doing a reddit AMA on our subreddit R / super effective if even if you miss it i'm sure

Pokemon here's podcast these guys don't talk about pokemon but you should give it a listen so they'll be your that'll be your kisses homework tell one friend about it's super effective that would be awesome can I give you the experience group answer yeah let's hear it the pokemon are assigned essentially a value that determines what amount of experience they need at each level to level up and obviously that number goes up as they tend towards getting leveling up to level 100 right it takes more experience to go from level 99 200 than it does to go from level 1 to 2 and it's not the same increase its not the same rate of increase for every species of Pokemon in fact there are six variants groups for it they're erratic fast medium fast medium slow slow and fluctuating and that's in order of go easiest to most difficult to get to level 100 essentially well the number of experience of points that have to be accumulated total the fluctuating has the most yes points that need to be accumulated total got it yeah that's a better way of saying it awesome finally you can follow us all on twitter if you care to do so Travis is at the Travis w-will is at wash in the sink I am at
