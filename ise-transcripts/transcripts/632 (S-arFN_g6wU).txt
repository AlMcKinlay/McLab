632nd episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:20 - 0:25)

Pokemon six this morning I didn&#39;t have I (0:36 - 0:41)
didn&#39;t have that I had like four six out (0:39 - 0:46)
of how many eight what yep that&#39;s wild (0:41 - 0:51)
so that&#39;s my day a Bobby also here yeah (0:46 - 0:54)
I had two hungry Pokemon this morning so (0:51 - 0:57)
not nearly the same as uh Steve or (0:54 - 1:00)
Hannah here it&#39;s like a horoscope for (0:57 - 1:03)
the day how many hungry Pokemon one of (1:00 - 1:06)
mine was also shiny so (1:03 - 1:10)
what wait which one Atkins nice I had a (1:06 - 1:13)
shiny ekins too what is happening yeah (1:10 - 1:16)
literally this morning (1:13 - 1:19)
amazing okay uh this my like fourth (1:16 - 1:21)
shiny ekins in the game or something (1:19 - 1:23)
like that I&#39;m playing this game wrong I (1:21 - 1:27)
haven&#39;t had a shiny in (1:23 - 1:32)
months classic um we do have our classic (1:27 - 1:35)
returning Pokemon sleep section of the (1:32 - 1:39)
podcast I know people were dying to keep (1:35 - 1:41)
up with what&#39;s happening in Pokemon (1:39 - 1:44)
sleep um last week if you listen to the (1:41 - 1:45)
episode it was about an hour long (1:44 - 1:48)
because they only gave me an hour in the (1:45 - 1:50)
hidden secret room that they gave me (1:48 - 1:53)
last minute at the World Championship uh (1:50 - 1:56)
so we didn&#39;t cover the new TCG stuff but (1:53 - 2:00)
there&#39;s also other TC TCG news (1:56 - 2:03)
so we&#39;re going to cover both of that uh (2:00 - 2:06)
and then after our first break uh I go (2:03 - 2:08)
more in depth with Pokemon unite of the (2:06 - 2:11)
new 500 point mode which I think is like (2:08 - 2:13)
important to talk about because there&#39;s (2:11 - 2:14)
only been (2:13 - 2:17)
like a handful of people in the United (2:14 - 2:19)
States that have played this (2:17 - 2:23)
mode and it&#39;s already hard enough to get (2:19 - 2:25)
into the public test (2:23 - 2:28)
server uh it&#39;s even harder to get into (2:25 - 2:30)
the Chinese public test server which (2:28 - 2:33)
technically that mode is on right now so (2:30 - 2:35)
uh I recorded a segment already with (2:33 - 2:38)
zoinks who is one of the commentators (2:35 - 2:40)
for the official Pokemon unite uh (2:38 - 2:43)
tournament bracket thing whatever you (2:40 - 2:45)
call that circuit tournament circuit (2:43 - 2:47)
that&#39;s probably the word sure that (2:45 - 2:50)
sounds about right uh so if you want to (2:47 - 2:52)
know more about the unite thing and what (2:50 - 2:54)
I played and what is supposed to be (2:52 - 2:58)
coming in Spring of 2025 uh that is a (2:54 - 3:01)
fun segment and then after the break uh (2:58 - 3:04)
there&#39;s a new Pokemon TV app coming (3:01 - 3:07)
Pokemon TV what was it actually called (3:04 - 3:09)
Pokemon T I don&#39;t remember what the app (3:07 - 3:11)
was called it died for a reason there&#39;s (3:09 - 3:16)
a new TV app coming is it the fast the (3:11 - 3:18)
something the fast is the new one it was (3:16 - 3:21)
just Pokemon TV the old one wasn&#39;t it (3:18 - 3:24)
yes yes yes yeah but I don&#39;t think we (3:21 - 3:26)
ever yeah I don&#39;t know if we I think (3:24 - 3:28)
that was (3:26 - 3:30)
internal was working on yeah it was like (3:28 - 3:33)
internal to the Pokemon company (3:30 - 3:38)
International yeah right um it was good (3:33 - 3:40)
do have a name yes it&#39;s not it&#39;s no (3:38 - 3:43)
longer around oh and now we&#39;re getting a (3:40 - 3:43)
new (3:43 - 3:48)
one TV Max or (3:43 - 3:51)
something okay so that&#39;s our show for (3:48 - 3:53)
the day uh let&#39;s talk uh let&#39;s start off (3:51 - 3:56)
with Pokemon sleep uh currently while (3:53 - 3:57)
while you&#39;re listening to this water (3:56 - 4:00)
week should be over (3:57 - 4:03)
uh and then there should be a week of (4:00 - 4:05)
nothingness like it has been and then (4:03 - 4:09)
starting on September 2nd through (4:05 - 4:14)
September 16th you&#39;ll have two weeks of (4:09 - 4:16)
suun (4:14 - 4:20)
and am I am I misremembering wasn&#39;t ente (4:16 - 4:23)
and raicho you had to be on green grass (4:20 - 4:27)
MH that&#39;s yep yep and this is saying (4:23 - 4:29)
week one you have to be on well you (4:27 - 4:32)
don&#39;t have to be but if you want we if (4:29 - 4:34)
you want the event you need to go to (4:32 - 4:36)
Greengrass week two you can go to (4:34 - 4:40)
Greengrass cyan Beach or lapis Lakeside (4:36 - 4:44)
so that is a new change (4:40 - 4:47)
right yeah so learning and growing right (4:44 - 4:49)
I mean I (4:47 - 4:51)
for for Reiko it sort of made sense that (4:49 - 4:53)
it was green because there&#39;s no electric (4:51 - 4:56)
like Island right so it&#39;s kind of like (4:53 - 4:59)
oh just do it on green grass ente I (4:56 - 5:00)
guess you could question like why didn&#39;t (4:59 - 5:03)
they allow Topo to be a part of that (5:00 - 5:05)
because could you imagine the music of (5:03 - 5:08)
Topo how it already is and then you add (5:05 - 5:11)
in the ente it would have been perfect (5:08 - 5:12)
it would have been Absol curious if the (5:11 - 5:14)
music is going to be the same on all (5:12 - 5:17)
three of these islands well because the (5:14 - 5:20)
music of green grass just changes (5:17 - 5:22)
slightly it&#39;s not like it&#39;s new music (5:20 - 5:25)
it&#39;s like the music but then it remix (5:22 - 5:27)
it&#39;s a remix I wouldn&#39;t say it changes (5:25 - 5:29)
slightly it&#39;s a whole remix but it&#39;s the (5:27 - 5:32)
same like it&#39;s a remix of the music from (5:29 - 5:34)
green grass so I don&#39;t think they would (5:32 - 5:37)
put that on cyan and Lapis I think they (5:34 - 5:38)
would have their (5:37 - 5:41)
own remix I&#39;m just that&#39;s what I&#39;m going (5:38 - 5:44)
maybe the maybe the music guy is like I (5:41 - 5:47)
really worked over time this week can we (5:44 - 5:51)
I I I had such inspiration I busted out (5:47 - 5:54)
three songs can we do all (5:51 - 5:56)
three I I think it&#39;s happen I think it&#39;s (5:54 - 5:58)
going to happen that way someday they (5:56 - 6:01)
need an album absolutely (5:58 - 6:02)
I&#39;m surprised there&#39;s not like a YouTube (6:01 - 6:06)
channel that&#39;s just these songs on (6:02 - 6:09)
repeat I try to find one and I couldn&#39;t (6:06 - 6:13)
I think someone in the slack sent me a (6:09 - 6:17)
link to a YouTube video a while ago that (6:13 - 6:19)
I think was all the songs that someone (6:17 - 6:22)
just put together into a video so I (6:19 - 6:24)
think that does exist um they should be (6:22 - 6:25)
separate (6:24 - 6:28)
videos I need like I need like a I need (6:25 - 6:30)
the YouTube video that&#39;s like (6:28 - 6:34)
6h hour relaxing Loop lapis (6:30 - 6:37)
Lakeside lowii Aesthetics that&#39;s what I (6:34 - 6:39)
need I wake up to that too many times (6:37 - 6:41)
when I fall asleep with the TV on and (6:39 - 6:44)
it&#39;s like something else on YouTube and (6:41 - 6:48)
then it always ends up back at like I&#39;m (6:44 - 6:52)
sitting in front of a giant room with a (6:48 - 6:56)
lake on the outside and there&#39;s some low (6:52 - 7:00)
fire8 hour thunderstorm happening yeah (6:56 - 7:01)
there&#39;s like a yeah exactly there&#39;s a (7:00 - 7:04)
thunderstorm happening and yeah so now (7:01 - 7:07)
my YouTube uh algorithm is like you (7:04 - 7:10)
love watching these videos you love (7:07 - 7:13)
eight hour Loi they are testing a sleep (7:10 - 7:16)
timer for YouTube premium members I&#39;ve (7:13 - 7:19)
seen so maybe oh really I need (7:16 - 7:22)
to okay uh okay so for the the for the (7:19 - 7:25)
event each uh each time a water helper (7:22 - 7:27)
Pokemon brings you ingredients it will (7:25 - 7:30)
have uh during regular helping it will (7:27 - 7:33)
have one extra ingredient the chance of (7:30 - 7:35)
water type Pokémon helper main skill (7:33 - 7:38)
being triggered will be multiplied by (7:35 - 7:41)
1.5 uh Snorlax in the event areas will (7:38 - 7:43)
default to Oren berries as one of its (7:41 - 7:45)
favorite berries the other two will be (7:43 - 7:48)
chosen as random which I don&#39;t know how (7:45 - 7:51)
that works on like lapis because Orin is (7:48 - 7:53)
not one of the ones so is it (7:51 - 7:56)
saying one is will for sure be oreberry (7:53 - 7:58)
and then the other two will be the (7:56 - 8:03)
random set of those original Three oh no (7:58 - 8:05)
I think they&#39;re just going to it it (8:03 - 8:06)
sounds to me like they&#39;re just going to (8:05 - 8:08)
randomize other two (8:06 - 8:10)
berries because I would love to have (8:08 - 8:13)
like the grass Berry on lapis and the (8:10 - 8:16)
water Berry on lapis cuz then Bulbasaur (8:13 - 8:18)
and Venusaur can or Venusaur and (8:16 - 8:20)
Blastoise can just like go to town with (8:18 - 8:23)
ingredients wouldn&#39;t you still want your (8:20 - 8:25)
whole team to be water Pokemon (8:23 - 8:28)
though yeah but you squeeze it you (8:25 - 8:31)
Venusaur can pretend to be it&#39;s a frog (8:28 - 8:33)
it can pretend to be a water Pokemon for (8:31 - 8:34)
a (8:33 - 8:37)
week got it don&#39;t think the game&#39;s going (8:34 - 8:38)
to let that (8:37 - 8:40)
work (8:38 - 8:42)
um a few Pokemon of different sleep (8:40 - 8:44)
types will appear regardless of what (8:42 - 8:46)
research you have certain Pokemon more (8:44 - 8:49)
likely to appear main level skills of (8:46 - 8:51)
all water type Pokemon will be boosted (8:49 - 8:52)
by (8:51 - 8:55)
one (8:52 - 8:58)
wasn&#39;t oh well sorry I didn&#39;t read ahead (8:55 - 9:00)
week two the main skill of water typee (8:58 - 9:04)
pokemon will be boosted by three (9:00 - 9:07)
yeah uh and a big Snorlax will appear on (9:04 - 9:10)
week two so what was Snorlax starting at (9:07 - 9:14)
last time like Ultra one Ultra four was (9:10 - 9:18)
it four it was Ultra four yeah okay uh (9:14 - 9:23)
and then Snorlax starting rating varies (9:18 - 9:25)
depending on (9:23 - 9:27)
area and then drowsy power will be (9:25 - 9:30)
multiplied by 1.5 on the second sun day (9:27 - 9:31)
of the (9:30 - 9:33)
event uh the Pokemon that are more (9:31 - 9:36)
likely to appear water note water type (9:33 - 9:37)
helping Pokemon oh sorry these are the (9:36 - 9:39)
Pokemon that will get the Boost that I (9:37 - 9:41)
just talked about Squirtle War torle (9:39 - 9:44)
Blastoise Psyduck Golduck Slowpoke slow (9:41 - 9:47)
bro Vaporeon todal cocona feraligator (9:44 - 9:51)
Whooper Quagsire slow King s [ __ ] (9:47 - 9:53)
quackley and quell a (9:51 - 9:56)
reminder that quack qual is a fighting (9:53 - 9:58)
Pokemon not a water so if you have a (9:56 - 10:00)
quack swell (9:58 - 10:02)
keep it as a quack swell until this (10:00 - 10:04)
event is over that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;ve (10:02 - 10:06)
done I&#39;ve had that thing as a quack (10:04 - 10:08)
swell and I was like gonna evolve it (10:06 - 10:10)
into quaal and then I was like oh wait (10:08 - 10:13)
no it turns to fighting I was like I&#39;m (10:10 - 10:15)
not so I&#39;ve had this quack swell for (10:13 - 10:16)
like a month and a half just ready to (10:15 - 10:18)
evolve it but I&#39;m like nope I have to (10:16 - 10:21)
wait till suun weeks are over I&#39;ve (10:18 - 10:23)
already seen a handful of people be like (10:21 - 10:25)
I evolved it and (10:23 - 10:28)
forgot yeah no no I have like a level 35 (10:25 - 10:30)
qua swell right now that I&#39;m like I want (10:28 - 10:33)
to evolve you but I need to wait all of (10:30 - 10:35)
them change their type yeah it&#39;s not (10:33 - 10:36)
particularly (10:35 - 10:40)
useful no no it&#39;s (10:36 - 10:43)
not you will still get the main way (10:40 - 10:45)
you&#39;ll still get the suun (10:43 - 10:51)
main for per first sleep session per day (10:45 - 10:53)
the number of suun man you get depends (10:51 - 10:54)
on the number of species of Pokémon and (10:53 - 10:57)
sleep Styles uh there will also be (10:54 - 11:00)
bundles you can exchange your (10:57 - 11:05)
suun M for suun incense suun biscuits (11:00 - 11:08)
main skill seeds water stone and more (11:05 - 11:12)
the suun biscuit is plus (11:08 - 11:12)
six (11:13 - 11:17)
which I don&#39;t know how that works with (11:15 - 11:21)
the Ultra Ball does one suun biscuit on (11:17 - 11:26)
Hungary leave five left over or six left (11:21 - 11:30)
over it leaves six because it would be (11:26 - 11:34)
it&#39;s at least 24 oh okay mhm so you (11:30 - 11:36)
would you need three biscuits you still (11:34 - 11:39)
need Ultra Ball and then poke ball or (11:36 - 11:42)
two I wouldn&#39;t say minimum yeah if if (11:39 - 11:45)
you get a critical hit on the ultra (11:42 - 11:49)
biscuit then you&#39;re good but (11:45 - 11:51)
true yeah well what&#39;s (11:49 - 11:53)
cheaper well you can&#39;t buy ult you have (11:51 - 11:54)
to buy Ultra with Diamonds though you (11:53 - 11:56)
can&#39;t buy Ultra with sleep points so and (11:54 - 12:00)
you can only buy like three yeah (11:56 - 12:02)
yeah it&#39;s kind of a lot of diamonds you (12:00 - 12:04)
can just get more suun biscuits that&#39;s (12:02 - 12:08)
the yeah that&#39;s the way to do (12:04 - 12:11)
it if you&#39;re new this is this is this is (12:08 - 12:13)
my my soap box I do not think you should (12:11 - 12:15)
waste a master ball and (12:13 - 12:19)
suun uh we we did this experiment on (12:15 - 12:21)
this show Bobby literally started (12:19 - 12:25)
playing like the day before ente showed (12:21 - 12:28)
up was it ente or was it REO and was (12:25 - 12:31)
able to get two (12:28 - 12:31)
Ryo with like never playing this game (12:31 - 12:40)
before MH yeah yeah you you will have no (12:34 - 12:42)
problem really you&#39;ll have no problem (12:40 - 12:45)
getting at least one suun if you are (12:42 - 12:49)
just playing it daily uh it it will (12:45 - 12:51)
happen and you want to get friends (12:49 - 12:52)
though you do want to get friends to try (12:51 - 12:55)
to get that suun main although I will (12:52 - 12:57)
say when raicho came out and I was new I (12:55 - 13:00)
added like 25 people I was like sweet (12:57 - 13:02)
hopefully I&#39;ll get like bunch of raicho (13:00 - 13:05)
main from this I got none in the two (13:02 - 13:07)
weeks that raicho was available I got (13:05 - 13:10)
none but as I leveled up when ente came (13:07 - 13:12)
about and I got more ente main from (13:10 - 13:16)
friends but yeah raicho has zero main (13:12 - 13:19)
from friends that was really (13:16 - 13:19)
sad uh yeah it looks very similar to (13:22 - 13:30)
past events minus the uh the option to (13:26 - 13:33)
change areas the week two (13:30 - 13:36)
so I do like that they&#39;re actually (13:33 - 13:39)
telling us that the Snorlax will be big (13:36 - 13:40)
the second week because I know a lot of (13:39 - 13:42)
people it caught a lot of people off (13:40 - 13:43)
guard (13:42 - 13:47)
because when raicho when raicho event (13:43 - 13:49)
happened they didn&#39;t there wasn&#39;t the (13:47 - 13:52)
Boost there wasn&#39;t the um main skill (13:49 - 13:54)
boost second week so every so but there (13:52 - 13:57)
was the ultra four start so when ente (13:54 - 13:59)
came about and they had the main skill (13:57 - 14:01)
boost for week two everyone thought oh (13:59 - 14:04)
this is taking place of it being Ultra 4 (14:01 - 14:06)
and then when week two came around it (14:04 - 14:09)
was a Ultra four Snorlax and so this (14:06 - 14:11)
time it&#39;s like they&#39;re actually just (14:09 - 14:12)
saying it right out front like you&#39;re (14:11 - 14:14)
going to get the Boost and also the (14:12 - 14:16)
Snorlax is going to be bigger that (14:14 - 14:17)
doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to be ultra four (14:16 - 14:19)
they they could change that too but at (14:17 - 14:22)
least they&#39;re telling right up front (14:19 - 14:23)
like week two you&#39;re going to have a (14:22 - 14:25)
bigger Snorlax to start which is (14:23 - 14:28)
nice I will admit though the surprise (14:25 - 14:30)
bigger Snorlax of the first event was (14:28 - 14:34)
kind of fun yeah it was it was a fun (14:30 - 14:36)
surprise yeah since that had never (14:34 - 14:38)
happened (14:36 - 14:40)
before that&#39;s true that&#39;s true I do like (14:38 - 14:43)
that they&#39;ve already broken pattern with (14:40 - 14:47)
like within this set of legendaries (14:43 - 14:49)
where you know with suun now it&#39;s you&#39;re (14:47 - 14:52)
able to go to cyan or lapis and so (14:49 - 14:54)
they&#39;re not they&#39;re already breaking (14:52 - 14:56)
away from setting into like oh (14:54 - 14:58)
everyone&#39;s going to think every one of (14:56 - 14:59)
these legendaries you have to be at (14:58 - 15:01)
green grass now and it&#39;s already like (14:59 - 15:03)
breaking away from that which is good (15:01 - 15:06)
because oh yeah you know P people in (15:03 - 15:08)
patterns they have slightly changed it (15:06 - 15:10)
each time I&#39;m really curious to see if (15:08 - 15:13)
it stays this similar for the next (15:10 - 15:15)
legendary Pokemon but we don&#39;t even know (15:13 - 15:17)
who that&#39;s going to be yet (15:15 - 15:19)
yeah that&#39;s true if if if they want to (15:17 - 15:22)
copy Niantic it&#39;ll be ho and Lugia and (15:19 - 15:24)
then it&#39;ll be ho and Lugia 47 more times (15:22 - 15:27)
in the next two (15:24 - 15:27)
years uh (15:28 - 15:33)
just before we move off as sleep just uh (15:30 - 15:35)
where did you guys end up going for (15:33 - 15:37)
water (15:35 - 15:39)
week I&#39;ve been in (15:37 - 15:42)
taupe oh you did go to taupe I did I (15:39 - 15:45)
mostly wanted Whooper so it&#39;s worked out (15:42 - 15:47)
pretty well I mean I got a shiny Atkins (15:45 - 15:51)
today so yes I I&#39;ve been in yeah I also (15:47 - 15:54)
went to taupe because I just also needed (15:51 - 15:56)
Whooper and I wanted to see when they (15:54 - 15:57)
say on the like you know when they say (15:56 - 15:59)
on the map of like this Pokemon can (15:57 - 16:01)
appear this way when well for taupe it (15:59 - 16:04)
was like only Wooper and Quagsire MH and (16:01 - 16:07)
I was like I wonder how often you would (16:04 - 16:10)
see them if it&#39;s water week and you can (16:07 - 16:12)
only get these two water Pokemon and I (16:10 - 16:15)
would say it was worth (16:12 - 16:19)
it I think so I saw Whooper almost every (16:15 - 16:22)
day maybe not two of the days so at (16:19 - 16:25)
least five of the seven yeah I think I (16:22 - 16:29)
saw Whooper every day except one day and (16:25 - 16:32)
and today I got three whoopers and two (16:29 - 16:37)
quag zires jeez nice okay well so I&#39;ve (16:32 - 16:39)
caught four (16:37 - 16:42)
Wooper and one was from incense so I&#39;m (16:39 - 16:44)
on Canan I&#39;m not on I&#39;m on Canan Beach (16:42 - 16:47)
okay um I caught four Whooper one was (16:44 - 16:48)
from incense the other three just showed (16:47 - 16:51)
up and then there were a couple Quagsire (16:48 - 16:52)
that showed up as well throughout the (16:51 - 16:54)
week (16:52 - 16:57)
so I guess I had about one oh I got two (16:54 - 17:01)
Whooper one day so yeah maybe like three (16:57 - 17:03)
four of the days this week there&#39;s been (17:01 - 17:06)
a Whooper or a Quagsire showing up on (17:03 - 17:09)
beach um so I mean I had get any shiny (17:06 - 17:13)
ekins or anything but uh but no I mean (17:09 - 17:16)
it wasn&#39;t too bad to get Whooper still (17:13 - 17:20)
being on beach um okay (17:16 - 17:20)
yeah yeah I still don&#39;t know what my (17:21 - 17:26)
water team will (17:24 - 17:29)
be like I have a I I think one of my (17:26 - 17:30)
whoopers is good I have my (17:29 - 17:34)
Blastoise mhm I have my (17:30 - 17:37)
feraligator have a good (17:34 - 17:40)
Vaporeon okay yeah I have multiple (17:37 - 17:42)
vaporeons but I don&#39;t know if I need (17:40 - 17:44)
more (17:42 - 17:46)
ingredients that&#39;s fair but the double (17:44 - 17:49)
skill boost thing that they have (17:46 - 17:52)
implemented recently is really nice yeah (17:49 - 17:54)
I might right FR I might run a Vaporeon (17:52 - 17:58)
week two cuz I have two shiny vaporeons (17:54 - 18:02)
from whatever event was it look St over (17:58 - 18:04)
here two shiny vapor and one of them is (18:02 - 18:06)
actually really good but then you have (18:04 - 18:08)
to like put the skill seeds into it (18:06 - 18:10)
which I didn&#39;t do so get getting like (18:08 - 18:13)
the free plus three boost (18:10 - 18:18)
yeah um seems Seems good see I I don&#39;t (18:13 - 18:20)
know if I made a wrong move there but (18:18 - 18:21)
I&#39;m so I&#39;m getting prepared to like go (18:20 - 18:24)
to snow drop and so because I haven&#39;t (18:21 - 18:25)
been to snow drop yet but I&#39;ve had it (18:24 - 18:29)
unlocked for like months and uh so (18:25 - 18:31)
wanted to get a good glacon and then (18:29 - 18:34)
some other stuff and so I used I had an (18:31 - 18:38)
Eevee with like skill the skill level up (18:34 - 18:40)
M or whatever the one that makes it plus (18:38 - 18:43)
two and then I evolve that to glacon so (18:40 - 18:45)
like I&#39;m getting it&#39;s like 17 extra (18:43 - 18:48)
items in your pot whenever it triggers (18:45 - 18:49)
oh right and it&#39;s skills based right so (18:48 - 18:51)
like the other day it triggered twice (18:49 - 18:52)
and it was all of a sudden like 34 extra (18:51 - 18:54)
ingredients in the pot I was like oh (18:52 - 18:56)
this is this is great I didn&#39;t have to (18:54 - 18:58)
do any skill seat or anything and like (18:56 - 19:00)
this is (18:58 - 19:02)
wonderful oh we didn&#39;t even talk about (19:00 - 19:07)
uh like Whooper as a as as a Pokemon oh (19:02 - 19:09)
yeah it has mushrooms lots of mushrooms (19:07 - 19:12)
it has mushrooms right away yes yeah (19:09 - 19:15)
that&#39;s which (19:12 - 19:20)
wild uh let me step back on the soap box (19:15 - 19:24)
of the the slow power creep that this (19:20 - 19:26)
game that I&#39;ve told people that this (19:24 - 19:29)
game has so I sorry to any people who (19:26 - 19:31)
have been looking for like a perfect (19:29 - 19:34)
Gengar because like Whooper kind of just (19:31 - 19:36)
outperforms Gengar if G your gengar&#39;s (19:34 - 19:40)
main mission is just to get like (19:36 - 19:42)
mushrooms because Whooper can get (19:40 - 19:44)
mushrooms quicker than Gengar can at (19:42 - 19:48)
level five or level one whatever it is (19:44 - 19:51)
um and then can get mushrooms all the (19:48 - 19:54)
way so it does does it make your Gengar (19:51 - 19:56)
like completely useless no but it does (19:54 - 19:59)
give you another option to be like okay (19:56 - 20:02)
I I don&#39;t need Gengar I can actually use (19:59 - 20:06)
Whooper instead yep um at least for that (20:02 - 20:09)
one ingredient yeah so mushrooms is the (20:06 - 20:11)
last ingredient that I actually unlocked (20:09 - 20:13)
so I had a I had a Shiny Gastly that I (20:11 - 20:16)
was kind of um working toward level 30 (20:13 - 20:19)
to get the mushroom unlocked and then it (20:16 - 20:21)
just I actually just unlocked mushrooms (20:19 - 20:23)
like this week and then of course woer (20:21 - 20:24)
comes out this week where it&#39;s like (20:23 - 20:26)
right at the beginning you get mushrooms (20:24 - 20:29)
but um see I hadn&#39;t actually unlocked (20:26 - 20:33)
mushrooms yet until I got a Whooper so (20:29 - 20:35)
now I have that ingredient oh wow it&#39;s (20:33 - 20:37)
great you had an unlocked mushrooms yet (20:35 - 20:40)
no I was (20:37 - 20:40)
lazy I (20:40 - 20:45)
see uh yeah that&#39;s it&#39;s not like you had (20:42 - 20:47)
like I don&#39;t fault anyone for that it&#39;s (20:45 - 20:49)
not like you had a lot of options to (20:47 - 20:52)
like unlock mushrooms yeah yeah that&#39;s (20:49 - 20:54)
true and like there there there are (20:52 - 20:55)
probably people listening that were like (20:54 - 20:57)
I also didn&#39;t unlock mushrooms cuz I (20:55 - 21:00)
didn&#39;t get a good enough Gastly and I (20:57 - 21:02)
didn&#39;t want to power up a Gastly didn&#39;t (21:00 - 21:04)
have a good enough Gastly didn&#39;t have a (21:02 - 21:05)
good enough (21:04 - 21:07)
Heracross was that the other one that (21:05 - 21:10)
could do mushrooms yep and that&#39;s it I (21:07 - 21:13)
think so oh wow yeah then the Whooper (21:10 - 21:17)
much needed so again again my my point (21:13 - 21:20)
has always been like don&#39;t chase after (21:17 - 21:24)
the like A+ S rank Pokemon (21:20 - 21:26)
because there are more Pokemon that are (21:24 - 21:28)
coming to this game and they will they (21:26 - 21:30)
they will slowly start to make certain (21:28 - 21:34)
Pokémon not like obsolete but like not (21:30 - 21:38)
not your only option to like chase after (21:34 - 21:40)
well so we were talking about this in (21:38 - 21:42)
the slack the other day but the only two (21:40 - 21:46)
ingredients left that don&#39;t have a like (21:42 - 21:50)
right off the bat like slot one is leak (21:46 - 21:55)
and Slowpoke tail and so people were (21:50 - 21:56)
like there I was looking at people were (21:55 - 21:58)
theorizing what pokemon would have leak (21:56 - 21:59)
first if they made it first and then (21:58 - 22:01)
obviously the obvious answer there would (21:59 - 22:03)
be like far-fetched yeah would probably (22:01 - 22:05)
have leak first um which would be (22:03 - 22:07)
exciting but yeah so that that&#39;s it (22:05 - 22:10)
there&#39;s only leak and Slowpoke tail left (22:07 - 22:12)
and I mean they already have Slowpoke in (22:10 - 22:13)
the (22:12 - 22:16)
game who would they give Slowpoke tail (22:13 - 22:18)
first two since Slowpoke already in the (22:16 - 22:20)
game is there a Pokemon that eats (22:18 - 22:23)
Slowpoke well there is sheler like (22:20 - 22:25)
shelder (22:23 - 22:29)
that yeah there is shelder there&#39;s (22:25 - 22:32)
shelter it could be (22:29 - 22:32)
shelter yeah I think Slowpoke tail is (22:33 - 22:39)
the best item though yes probably yeah (22:35 - 22:42)
it&#39;s like 348 points or something it&#39;s (22:39 - 22:44)
way higher than every other point uh (22:42 - 22:46)
like value for (22:44 - 22:48)
ingredient I&#39;m still working on leveling (22:46 - 22:50)
up my ditto that gets Slowpoke Tails (22:48 - 22:51)
because that&#39;s the one I really want to (22:50 - 22:54)
work on oh did O get Slowpoke tail it (22:51 - 22:57)
can see I went through and evolve or did (22:54 - 23:00)
a Slowpoke evolve it to slow bro and got (22:57 - 23:02)
that up to 30 and then never thought (23:00 - 23:04)
about it again cuz slow bro is bad (23:02 - 23:06)
pretty much yeah although I might use it (23:04 - 23:09)
during water week maybe we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see (23:06 - 23:12)
but or during suun week but um what I&#39;m (23:09 - 23:14)
hearing is that this next week between (23:12 - 23:17)
the events is when everybody needs to (23:14 - 23:20)
stock up on slow poke Tails if you (23:17 - 23:23)
can good point well I don&#39;t I don&#39;t even (23:20 - 23:26)
know what I have like five easy travel (23:23 - 23:27)
tickets or (23:26 - 23:30)
whatever and I don&#39;t even know what meal (23:27 - 23:33)
I want I because of Blastoise I feel (23:30 - 23:36)
like I want desserts because Blastoise (23:33 - 23:38)
get so much milk (23:36 - 23:40)
MH you mean for suun week or for like (23:38 - 23:44)
stack for we right right but then I have (23:40 - 23:47)
like the triple mushroom Whooper so (23:44 - 23:49)
that&#39;s like good for (23:47 - 23:51)
salads yes I mean this week I&#39;ve got (23:49 - 23:53)
salads and it&#39;s been wonderful having (23:51 - 23:55)
having unlocked mushrooms and being able (23:53 - 24:00)
to make ninja salad is great (23:55 - 24:04)
so yeah I don&#39;t I I I don&#39;t know what I (24:00 - 24:07)
want got a week to think about it no (24:04 - 24:11)
Curry no Curry for you (24:07 - 24:14)
nah it&#39;s (24:11 - 24:14)
fine yeah well yeah blasto got (24:15 - 24:23)
milk and Psyduck got cacao if you have a (24:19 - 24:25)
if you&#39;re using a Psyduck or Golduck no (24:23 - 24:30)
Golduck meta during ween week even (24:25 - 24:30)
all right fine fine we don&#39;t know what (24:30 - 24:36)
uh obviously we don&#39;t know what suun has (24:33 - 24:37)
yet for (24:36 - 24:40)
its ingredients wise no we won&#39;t know (24:37 - 24:41)
that (24:40 - 24:44)
till they when did we like they usually (24:41 - 24:46)
find out from data mines like a week or (24:44 - 24:48)
a few days before right a couple days (24:46 - 24:53)
before the items yeah um it&#39;s usually I (24:48 - 24:55)
think there&#39;s there there&#39;s like a (24:53 - 24:57)
maintenance update coming um I don&#39;t (24:55 - 24:59)
have the news in front of me I just (24:57 - 25:01)
closed it but uh there we&#39;ll find out (24:59 - 25:03)
when like the maintenance is complete (25:01 - 25:04)
right and (25:03 - 25:06)
then you can at least see what (25:04 - 25:09)
ingredients it has I um but the skills (25:06 - 25:12)
we wouldn&#39;t know but if it&#39;s based on (25:09 - 25:13)
raicho and ente they had like the same (25:12 - 25:17)
exact skills yeah so safe to assume that (25:13 - 25:21)
suun has that right the first one you (25:17 - 25:23)
catch the first one yeah the first like (25:21 - 25:24)
guaranteed one (25:23 - 25:27)
yeah uh okay so last week we were (25:24 - 25:30)
talking about all the the world&#39;s news (25:27 - 25:33)
they showed the 2025 location the 2026 (25:30 - 25:36)
location the unite stuff that we&#39;ll talk (25:33 - 25:37)
about in the next (25:36 - 25:40)
segment uh we did talk about Pokemon (25:37 - 25:43)
pocket which launches October (25:40 - 25:46)
30th uh the thing we didn&#39;t talk about (25:43 - 25:49)
was they showed the trainer Pokemon (25:46 - 25:52)
coming back to the TCG in (25:49 - 25:56)
2025 which is uh Pokemon TCG cards (25:52 - 25:58)
featuring trainer Pokemon like Lily&#39;s (25:56 - 26:03)
clef ex Marin&#39;s H Marini Mar&#39;s Grim snal (25:58 - 26:07)
ex n&#39;s Zoroark EX and then there they (26:03 - 26:10)
showed an illustration rare featuring NS (26:07 - 26:13)
reram and then they don&#39;t say this in (26:10 - 26:15)
the press release but they do flash the (26:13 - 26:19)
Team Rocket logo on the screen for a (26:15 - 26:22)
short second so (26:19 - 26:25)
um Bobby I think we knew this was coming (26:22 - 26:27)
although I don&#39;t think we knew they were (26:25 - 26:29)
going to do like a whole made trailer to (26:27 - 26:32)
preview these cards a really good (26:29 - 26:34)
trailer yeah it was such a good trailer (26:32 - 26:38)
that was that was amazing um but no we (26:34 - 26:42)
did know um there had been I don&#39;t know (26:38 - 26:44)
I forget what it was trademark names or (26:42 - 26:46)
something like that that had come out so (26:44 - 26:47)
we knew there was a trainer set coming (26:46 - 26:51)
we knew there was a rocket set coming at (26:47 - 26:53)
some point um and they would be (26:51 - 26:55)
following a couple other sets that are (26:53 - 26:59)
coming out before that so most likely I (26:55 - 27:02)
would guess based on how they do time (26:59 - 27:04)
the time frame of the sets we know the (27:02 - 27:06)
set that&#39;s coming out in November which (27:04 - 27:07)
where I think we&#39;ll talk about here in a (27:06 - 27:10)
moment but um and then I would guess the (27:07 - 27:13)
trainer set will be something similar to (27:10 - 27:17)
like a January set like palan Fates or (27:13 - 27:19)
like shining those were like January (27:17 - 27:21)
sets um and then I would guess rocket (27:19 - 27:24)
would be after that so I would (27:21 - 27:26)
assume January is time frame for the (27:24 - 27:28)
trainers and then I would guess like (27:26 - 27:31)
March for the rocket set do you think (27:28 - 27:33)
that trainers is just going to be like (27:31 - 27:36)
one set you don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to (27:33 - 27:39)
be uh they could like I think the rocket (27:36 - 27:42)
set could also have trainer like they (27:39 - 27:45)
could do something with like rockets (27:42 - 27:48)
Pokemon in there so like that same that (27:45 - 27:52)
same um like theme could carry over (27:48 - 27:54)
right but I think they&#39;ll at least start (27:52 - 27:57)
with just the first set being in January (27:54 - 27:59)
and then maybe that theme carries over (27:57 - 28:02)
into the rocket set as well in (27:59 - 28:04)
March I kind of got the impression that (28:02 - 28:06)
like the first set will be (28:04 - 28:10)
Lily Marney and and then the second set (28:06 - 28:12)
would (28:10 - 28:16)
be go or Ethan I don&#39;t Ethan and cuz (28:12 - 28:19)
then they hint at like two more people (28:16 - 28:21)
like really last minute one of them (28:19 - 28:23)
being Ethan and then the other one being (28:21 - 28:24)
I don&#39;t remember I&#39;d have to look at the (28:23 - 28:27)
trailer again in the trailer they did I (28:24 - 28:29)
don&#39;t I don&#39;t remember that (28:27 - 28:32)
but it was like kind of like right after (28:29 - 28:34)
n appeared or maybe I&#39;m thinking of the (28:32 - 28:36)
Pokemon master I don&#39;t think I think (28:34 - 28:38)
you&#39;re thinking of Pokemon Masters I&#39;m (28:36 - 28:41)
pretty sure n was like because they they (28:38 - 28:44)
did the whole thing with n having like (28:41 - 28:45)
the (28:44 - 28:48)
reram the zeom like all of that was kind (28:45 - 28:50)
of the end of the trailer and then that (28:48 - 28:54)
like beautiful illustration rare of of (28:50 - 28:57)
reram um but I don&#39;t remember anything (28:54 - 29:01)
other than that and then rocket symbol (28:57 - 29:01)
obviously oh yeah they do they do show (29:03 - 29:10)
um they show Ethan Misty and uh what&#39;s (29:06 - 29:13)
his name the guy with the dog mosti (29:10 - 29:17)
Arvin Arvin the guy with the do dog (29:13 - 29:20)
dog yeah so they they show Missy Psyduck (29:17 - 29:22)
at one point then they show Ethan coming (29:20 - 29:25)
out of the house and then they show (29:22 - 29:30)
Arvin making a sandwich with maasti yeah (29:25 - 29:32)
well so to me that seems like a second (29:30 - 29:35)
TCG set you think so you think there&#39;ll (29:32 - 29:39)
only be three h so I mean the last time (29:35 - 29:41)
they did this was in black and white and (29:39 - 29:44)
right yeah how many do you remember (29:41 - 29:46)
approximately like how many trainers (29:44 - 29:48)
they would have per trainer Pokemon (29:46 - 29:50)
they&#39;d have per set I feel like there&#39;s (29:48 - 29:53)
there&#39; be more than three (29:50 - 29:57)
but maybe I&#39;m wrong yeah I think I think (29:53 - 29:58)
there will be more characters right (29:57 - 30:00)
right like when you when you think of (29:58 - 30:02)
like (30:00 - 30:05)
popular (30:02 - 30:05)
trainers n is up there hands down n n is (30:06 - 30:13)
up there so n is like your Chase Card (30:10 - 30:15)
right um and (30:13 - 30:21)
then uh Lily and Marne are incredibly (30:15 - 30:23)
popular characters yep you know who&#39;s (30:21 - 30:26)
more popular than both of those (30:23 - 30:30)
Misty yeah so feel like you have Misty (30:26 - 30:33)
in another set I feel like they have to (30:30 - 30:36)
do a ra card here too (30:33 - 30:39)
right there was that competition where (30:36 - 30:41)
everybody voted on the best character in (30:39 - 30:43)
scarlet and violet and Ric won in a (30:41 - 30:47)
landslide oh yeah ra yeah uh I was (30:43 - 30:50)
thinking Erica as well Erica is also (30:47 - 30:52)
also very popular incredibly popular in (30:50 - 30:54)
Japan no clue why CU I feel like she&#39;s (30:52 - 30:57)
like normally popular here but she&#39;s (30:54 - 31:02)
like just crazy popular in Japan so yeah (30:57 - 31:03)
you have (31:02 - 31:07)
ra uh you have Erica you have Misty like (31:03 - 31:09)
I just don&#39;t think you fit all those (31:07 - 31:14)
trainers in the first set true yeah I (31:09 - 31:15)
get they probably wouldn&#39;t want to they (31:14 - 31:16)
wouldn&#39;t want to do that anyway they (31:15 - 31:18)
would they could spread it across (31:16 - 31:22)
multiple sets but uh yeah because you (31:18 - 31:24)
also have I feel like they&#39;d probably (31:22 - 31:28)
do um although they have like the the (31:24 - 31:31)
Charizard is like Terra I was going to (31:28 - 31:32)
say like Leon&#39;s Charizard or something (31:31 - 31:36)
maybe but yeah um and then I don&#39;t know (31:32 - 31:38)
like Red&#39;s Pikachu I feel like stuff (31:36 - 31:41)
like that would have to probably be in (31:38 - 31:45)
there as well um but I don&#39;t know it&#39;s (31:41 - 31:47)
interesting because like they had the (31:45 - 31:49)
trainer gallery and I know it wasn&#39;t (31:47 - 31:52)
specifically like so and so as Pokemon (31:49 - 31:53)
but they had the trainer Gallery in (31:52 - 31:55)
sword and shield and so you s kind of (31:53 - 31:59)
saw all of these right like you saw like (31:55 - 32:01)
um was it like Cynthia with Garchomp or (31:59 - 32:04)
like with like um yeah you know red with (32:01 - 32:07)
Pikachu and and all of that so are they (32:04 - 32:08)
just going to turn around and do the (32:07 - 32:10)
same thing except now it&#39;s (32:08 - 32:14)
like their Pokemon right like same (32:10 - 32:16)
combos uh or you know are they going to (32:14 - 32:20)
change it up at all is and I guess we&#39;ll (32:16 - 32:22)
see but yeah there there would probably (32:20 - 32:25)
be like gameplay mechanics around it (32:22 - 32:27)
yeah oh yeah (32:25 - 32:30)
yeah uh as like like what you said (32:27 - 32:32)
before like the Cynthia Cynthia&#39;s (32:30 - 32:36)
Garchomp which was just Garchomp right (32:32 - 32:39)
like didn&#39;t have any specific rules it (32:36 - 32:41)
just had Cynthia on the card next to the (32:39 - 32:43)
garch but (32:41 - 32:46)
right uh but yeah if you haven&#39;t seen (32:43 - 32:48)
the trailer even if you don&#39;t like (32:46 - 32:51)
TCG man what a cool (32:48 - 32:51)
trailer yeah if you know these (32:51 - 32:55)
characters and like these characters at (32:53 - 32:56)
all highly (32:55 - 32:59)
recommend uh yeah the trailer super cool (32:56 - 33:02)
um before we go to our break uh there (32:59 - 33:06)
was a new TCG set announced this is the (33:02 - 33:08)
the next one coming out it looks (33:06 - 33:12)
like uh which is the surging Sparks (33:08 - 33:14)
which is going to be available November (33:12 - 33:18)
8th it will feature eight aspec cards (33:14 - 33:23)
nine Stellar to Pokemon EX um 23 (33:18 - 33:25)
illustration rares 11 special (33:23 - 33:27)
illustration rares and supporters and (33:25 - 33:32)
six hyper rare gold etch (33:27 - 33:32)
cards yeah this is this is the scarlet (33:33 - 33:39)
and violet eras Vivid voltage it&#39;s like (33:36 - 33:42)
even the same like surging Sparks Vivid (33:39 - 33:45)
voltage it&#39;s like the it&#39;s the same like (33:42 - 33:47)
theme with the uh with that alliteration (33:45 - 33:51)
there and uh and Pikachu is prominently (33:47 - 33:55)
featured on that Elite Trainer Box which (33:51 - 33:57)
if it so what they&#39;ve done now with the (33:55 - 33:59)
starting with the next set which comes (33:57 - 34:01)
out September 13th Stellar Crown is (33:59 - 34:03)
they&#39;re going to have these like um the (34:01 - 34:06)
Stellar Terra cards (34:03 - 34:09)
and they&#39;re sort of bringing back (34:06 - 34:10)
rainbow rares in a way because those (34:09 - 34:12)
Stellar ter those Stellar Terra cards (34:10 - 34:14)
are rainbow like they&#39;re not rainbow in (34:12 - 34:16)
the same way but they&#39;re like the (34:14 - 34:18)
borders are rainbow and then if you pull (34:16 - 34:21)
like the special illustration rare ones (34:18 - 34:24)
they&#39;re very rainbow like and so I&#39;m (34:21 - 34:27)
just thinking there&#39;s going to be a (34:24 - 34:30)
rainbow like Stellar Tera Pikachu in (34:27 - 34:33)
this set and I&#39;m sure that that will be (34:30 - 34:35)
like the the Chase card for the (34:33 - 34:37)
collectors at least for the for the set (34:35 - 34:40)
will be this Pikachu is my guess um but (34:37 - 34:45)
looks like a cool set It&#39;s a combination (34:40 - 34:49)
of uh JP Japan&#39;s paradise drona and (34:45 - 34:51)
supercharged breaker which I don&#39;t we (34:49 - 34:52)
haven&#39;t seen anything from supercharged (34:51 - 34:56)
breaker um Paradise drona (34:52 - 34:59)
features shockingly Dr Pokemon uh yeah (34:56 - 35:01)
it says it says here in the press (34:59 - 35:05)
release uh that uh in this expansion (35:01 - 35:06)
players can collect and battle with (35:05 - 35:08)
cards themed around the terrarium an (35:06 - 35:10)
artificial Paradise first introduced in (35:08 - 35:12)
the Hidden Treasures of area Zero part (35:10 - 35:14)
two the Indigo disc for Pokemon scarlet (35:12 - 35:16)
and violet video games discover the (35:14 - 35:19)
Towering alolan exeggutor EX in its (35:16 - 35:21)
Stellar form alongside other powerful (35:19 - 35:23)
Dragon (35:21 - 35:27)
Pokemon yeah there&#39;s some really nice uh (35:23 - 35:30)
laddio lattos and lidios cards in (35:27 - 35:32)
Paradise drona which will be making (35:30 - 35:34)
their way to um this set as well which (35:32 - 35:39)
is cool um but yeah so a nice mixture of (35:34 - 35:41)
I guess pretty much dragon Pokemon and (35:39 - 35:44)
electric Pokemon I think are going to be (35:41 - 35:47)
he just heavily featured in this in this (35:44 - 35:48)
set and I think what is this set like (35:47 - 35:50)
it&#39;s probably like (35:48 - 35:53)
20 280 cards or something somewhere (35:50 - 35:54)
probably around there is usually what (35:53 - 35:57)
they are they do not have card count in (35:54 - 35:59)
the Press (35:57 - 36:01)
really they usually they usually (35:59 - 36:06)
do I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a big set yeah um I&#39;m (36:01 - 36:08)
sure it&#39;s huge they all seem to be this (36:06 - 36:10)
time um so are we getting one more (36:08 - 36:12)
scarlet and violet set after this or you (36:10 - 36:14)
think we&#39;re going right into trainer (36:12 - 36:16)
cards no I think this is it I think (36:14 - 36:16)
we&#39;re (36:16 - 36:19)
getting surging Sparks cuz I&#39;m trying to (36:16 - 36:20)
think of what else they would need to (36:19 - 36:22)
give us for scarlet and violet stuff (36:20 - 36:25)
just like more Stellar Pokemon yeah but (36:22 - 36:27)
they and they already gave us tagos and (36:25 - 36:30)
they already gave us and they gave us um (36:27 - 36:34)
Peter run in shrouded Fable (36:30 - 36:37)
so we have not gotten a stellar Rayquaza (36:34 - 36:41)
yet a black Rayquaza some would (36:37 - 36:44)
say there is an entire box dedicated to (36:41 - 36:46)
Pokemon Horizons though the Grand (36:44 - 36:48)
Adventure collection oh yeah being (36:46 - 36:51)
released as part of this oh yeah that I (36:48 - 36:53)
think that that because there&#39;s it&#39;s (36:51 - 36:55)
like the the card that there&#39;s a promo (36:53 - 36:57)
card that comes with it that&#39;s tagos and (36:55 - 36:58)
Friends (36:57 - 37:00)
and I do wonder if there&#39;ll be like a (36:58 - 37:03)
full art version of that but like every (37:00 - 37:05)
toward the end of every set they&#39;ve had (37:03 - 37:08)
like a friends in Galler friends in Hui (37:05 - 37:12)
friends in right like and so I I really (37:08 - 37:14)
do think this is kind of coming toward (37:12 - 37:17)
the end of scarlet Violet and then (37:14 - 37:20)
trainers rocket these are all going to (37:17 - 37:24)
be you know not stalling but like (37:20 - 37:28)
getting like other card filler sets of (37:24 - 37:33)
until um Legends uh Za comes out I think (37:28 - 37:34)
uh (37:33 - 37:37)
which based on I had this Theory a few (37:34 - 37:40)
weeks ago but now it&#39;s looking like yeah (37:37 - 37:44)
maybe Za doesn&#39;t come out in January (37:40 - 37:45)
February (37:44 - 37:48)
March maybe April May or June I&#39;m (37:45 - 37:50)
starting to move it forward I&#39;m starting (37:48 - 37:52)
to move it back like Steve like Steve (37:50 - 37:55)
was saying uh because now the TCG it (37:52 - 37:57)
depends on you know how many more of (37:55 - 37:58)
these sets are they going to put in the (37:57 - 38:02)
middle of it to uh to get to Legend Za (37:58 - 38:06)
who knows yeah I&#39;m still kind of holding (38:02 - 38:08)
out hope for an early year release but (38:06 - 38:09)
we&#39;ll (38:08 - 38:12)
see April April could still be they (38:09 - 38:13)
could still do it in (38:12 - 38:16)
April but the last Legends game was (38:13 - 38:18)
practically a birthday present for me it (38:16 - 38:20)
was great I was really looking forward (38:18 - 38:23)
to that happening (38:20 - 38:26)
again yeah same (38:23 - 38:29)
same uh okay let&#39;s take a quick break (38:26 - 38:31)
when we come back we&#39;re going to talk (38:29 - 38:35)
about unite and uh then after that we (38:31 - 38:39)
have some more news so we will be right (38:35 - 38:39)
back and we&#39;re back from our break with (38:51 - 38:58)
zoinks amazing and always future maybe (38:54 - 39:02)

commentator one day oh yeah me too hey (39:03 - 39:09)
if you&#39;re the one guaranteeing it that&#39;s (39:07 - 39:11)
perfect because if it works out amazing (39:09 - 39:13)
if it doesn&#39;t I know who to get mad at (39:11 - 39:15)
so this is perfect I love this perfect (39:13 - 39:17)
right we know sometimes Pokemon listens (39:15 - 39:19)
to these podcasts so we&#39;re just saying (39:17 - 39:23)
always future links (39:19 - 39:23)

it&#39;s good to be back it&#39;s it&#39;s been (39:26 - 39:29)
while I&#39;m super excited to be on super (39:28 - 39:32)
effective once again yeah yeah yeah if (39:29 - 39:34)
uh that that wasn&#39;t like a joke or (39:32 - 39:35)
anything if people don&#39;t know who you (39:34 - 39:38)
are you are one of the commentators for (39:35 - 39:41)
the unite bracket no and to be clear (39:38 - 39:44)
it&#39;s not a joke it&#39;s a demand and (39:41 - 39:47)
Pokemon well yeah we&#39;ll (39:44 - 39:51)
see okay so uh last week I talked about (39:47 - 39:54)
how I was brought on to play the new (39:51 - 39:58)
unite mode early and I believe all the (39:54 - 40:00)
commentators got to play this mode early (39:58 - 40:02)
as (40:00 - 40:06)
well well uh not we actually did not get (40:02 - 40:10)
to play it early we were given like a (40:06 - 40:15)
packet that was clearly by some machine (40:10 - 40:18)
translated for us uh that we were able (40:15 - 40:20)
to like parse through a lot of the (40:18 - 40:22)
information and things like that but um (40:20 - 40:24)
but yes the new game mod that you were (40:22 - 40:26)
playing has been played on the various (40:24 - 40:28)
China betas that have been out over the (40:26 - 40:31)
course of like the last six months or so (40:28 - 40:33)
uh in China so I&#39;ve been keeping a (40:31 - 40:35)
pretty close eye on those game modes and (40:33 - 40:38)
stuff and what we saw on stage at Worlds (40:35 - 40:40)
the game mode that you participated in (40:38 - 40:43)
was extremely close if not the current (40:40 - 40:46)
beta that is ongoing in China uh at at (40:43 - 40:49)
time of recording so um yeah it was it (40:46 - 40:50)
was pretty sweet we were it was pretty (40:49 - 40:53)
hush hush up until then I like I mean we (40:50 - 40:55)
were all we were allowed to do was talk (40:53 - 40:57)
about how it was going to be a cool show (40:55 - 40:58)
match (40:57 - 40:59)
um but it was pretty exciting I don&#39;t (40:58 - 41:01)
know I was uh I was pretty excited to (40:59 - 41:04)
see all of you up there on stage with (41:01 - 41:06)
some Timmy chosen creators I know that (41:04 - 41:08)
must have been exciting having a (41:06 - 41:10)
language barrier on stage but uh I think (41:08 - 41:12)
it played off pretty cool they were they (41:10 - 41:14)
were Timmy (41:12 - 41:18)
creators specifically okay chosen (41:14 - 41:21)
creators and players so a lot of them (41:18 - 41:24)
are like xpros from other mobile uh (41:21 - 41:26)
games like we had a couple honor Kings (41:24 - 41:30)
players up there I think there was like (41:26 - 41:32)
well it&#39;s arena of valeries honor of (41:30 - 41:34)
Kings It&#39;s the weird thing with Timmy (41:32 - 41:36)
games but yeah they they were all like X (41:34 - 41:38)
players or like large uh content (41:36 - 41:40)
creators in China yeah got it got it (41:38 - 41:43)
they were they were like the best part (41:40 - 41:47)
of our matches they were they were so (41:43 - 41:49)
fun to play with there was a language (41:47 - 41:53)
barrier but like kind of understanding (41:49 - 41:54)
just like they knew enough English to be (41:53 - 41:56)
like okay we we know what we&#39;re doing (41:54 - 41:58)
together for one or two games that we (41:56 - 42:01)
played all right to back up a little bit (41:58 - 42:03)
uh I I know I I talked about this a lot (42:01 - 42:05)
a little bit last week but zoinks is (42:03 - 42:07)
here to fill in any gaps and to kind of (42:05 - 42:09)
explain it better because it has been (42:07 - 42:13)
out in China for a little bit yeah um I (42:09 - 42:16)
was given uh I I got DMD like two weeks (42:13 - 42:17)
before worlds and was like do you want (42:16 - 42:20)
to play in this new unite mode we have (42:17 - 42:22)
at Worlds and I was like yeah cool sign (42:20 - 42:26)
me up is if I can play crar I&#39;m 100% in (42:22 - 42:29)
that that sounds awesome (42:26 - 42:31)
and it was supposed to be like five (42:29 - 42:33)
o&#39;clock on Friday and like anything out (42:31 - 42:35)
worlds things got pushed first then it (42:33 - 42:36)
got moved to four and then I got pushed (42:35 - 42:39)
to six I think it actually did go up at (42:36 - 42:42)
6 and they they didn&#39;t tell us anything (42:39 - 42:44)
they were just like new mode and unite (42:42 - 42:46)
five o&#39;clock or six o&#39;clock uh on Friday (42:44 - 42:48)
that was it I didn&#39;t sign any ndas I (42:46 - 42:50)
didn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t prepped anything I (42:48 - 42:51)
didn&#39;t really ask any questions I was (42:50 - 42:54)
like in my head I thought it was like (42:51 - 42:57)
like a new Halloween mode coming out for (42:54 - 42:59)
unite what they do for seasonal stuff oh (42:57 - 43:01)
okay yeah just like a seasonal quick (42:59 - 43:03)
mode or something like that because (43:01 - 43:05)
there was no ndas or anything but I (43:03 - 43:07)
guess I guess you don&#39;t have to sign an (43:05 - 43:09)
NDA if they literally don&#39;t tell you (43:07 - 43:13)
anything there you go that&#39;s the (43:09 - 43:15)
trick so I didn&#39;t think anything of it (43:13 - 43:17)
and then they G they made us (43:15 - 43:20)
jerseys and those are sick they were (43:17 - 43:22)
like okay report to the unit stage so I (43:20 - 43:26)
went to the side unite stage oh yeah (43:22 - 43:28)
where ion ically the tournament was (43:26 - 43:30)
still going on that was a point of (43:28 - 43:33)
contention in the unite stream and (43:30 - 43:36)
everything because like we still had (43:33 - 43:38)
like tournament matches that were like (43:36 - 43:40)
mattered for teams that went to day two (43:38 - 43:41)
but we&#39;re like well we got to show the (43:40 - 43:43)
show match so it was like this weird mix (43:41 - 43:45)
but they still got to play on a stage (43:43 - 43:47)
but it wasn&#39;t on a stream but anyway you (43:45 - 43:48)
found your way over to the right stage (43:47 - 43:52)
right yeah the stage they brought us (43:48 - 43:54)
back behind M stage which I feel like we (43:52 - 43:58)
could do an hour of what is behind main (43:54 - 44:02)
stage like just the production happening (43:58 - 44:05)
back there is on just another level it&#39;s (44:02 - 44:07)
crazy worlds especially too because I (44:05 - 44:10)
mean there&#39;s the four titles so you have (44:07 - 44:13)
four production teams plus like engineer (44:10 - 44:15)
and then like overheads that are like (44:13 - 44:17)
like you know all four games kind of (44:15 - 44:19)
thing but then you also have like a (44:17 - 44:22)
Japanese production team as a part of it (44:19 - 44:24)
as well so they&#39;re not on the main line (44:22 - 44:25)
they often have their own stations kind (44:24 - 44:27)
of set up separately but it&#39;s like you (44:25 - 44:29)
have two production companies working in (44:27 - 44:31)
tandem um all for the same production (44:29 - 44:33)
often sharing feeds and and sound and (44:31 - 44:36)
things like that but it is uh it&#39;s a lot (44:33 - 44:37)
of people a lot of moving Parts which (44:36 - 44:42)
you got to witness um a lot of poor Pas (44:37 - 44:44)
running back and forth sprinting trying (44:42 - 44:47)
to find Talent OR players or a water (44:44 - 44:49)
bottle whatever it is like there&#39;s a (44:47 - 44:52)
it&#39;s a lot of chaos but um as long as it (44:49 - 44:53)
looks good on stage that&#39;s all we&#39;re (44:52 - 44:55)
it&#39;s all we&#39;re trying to make happen (44:53 - 44:57)
yeah yeah it was it was that in itself (44:55 - 44:59)
was was just like really cool just to be (44:57 - 45:02)
behind stage and see everything like all (44:59 - 45:05)
the moving Parts happen cuz as a as a as (45:02 - 45:08)
a like twitch streamer it&#39;s it&#39;s just me (45:05 - 45:10)
it&#39;s just the camera it&#39;s OBS and me (45:08 - 45:14)
hitting buttons and here it was like (45:10 - 45:17)
four monitors per station two 20 (45:14 - 45:21)
stations at least and then all of these (45:17 - 45:23)
buttons and the most amount of ethernet (45:21 - 45:25)
chords I&#39;ve ever seen at a Pokemon event (45:23 - 45:28)
ever oh it&#39;s crazy yeah as like for my (45:25 - 45:30)
full-time job I have to work with like a (45:28 - 45:32)
lot of uh like running cable and like (45:30 - 45:34)
terminating ethernet cords and stuff and (45:32 - 45:36)
I was just like oh the nightmare it must (45:34 - 45:38)
be to set up this equipment is so (45:36 - 45:40)
terrifying and even worse the takedown (45:38 - 45:43)
but uh yeah was you actually you (45:40 - 45:44)
mentioned the jerseys a little bit (45:43 - 45:47)
earlier Steve I&#39;m super curious what you (45:44 - 45:49)
thought of them because uh the unite (45:47 - 45:52)
jerseys so every team gets those jerseys (45:49 - 45:56)
as well um however you know how yours (45:52 - 45:58)
would had like the purple and orange (45:56 - 46:00)
kind of color on the floors across so (45:58 - 46:03)
every region has its own color given by (46:00 - 46:06)
unit so America&#39;s is like a dark blue or (46:03 - 46:08)
like North America is Europe is like a (46:06 - 46:10)
red um I think Brazil&#39;s its really cool (46:08 - 46:14)
pink color uh and you know all like I (46:10 - 46:16)
forget like 16 regions or whatever it is (46:14 - 46:19)
um have their own unique color but like (46:16 - 46:21)
I thought the designs popped off like (46:19 - 46:23)
crazy this year I thought it was so good (46:21 - 46:25)
I didn&#39;t know that regions had their own (46:23 - 46:28)
colors at all that&#39;s so cool yeah (46:25 - 46:29)
um and then the design of course like (46:28 - 46:31)
kind of local to Hawaii I thought was (46:29 - 46:33)
really sweet and the cool thing about (46:31 - 46:34)
the Jersey this year which none of us (46:33 - 46:37)
knew they&#39;re not for sale in the Pokemon (46:34 - 46:39)
Center which is I love that I think it&#39;d (46:37 - 46:42)
be so cool but they were you could win (46:39 - 46:45)
them on the prize wall so the jersey (46:42 - 46:48)
that you had you could get at the prize (46:45 - 46:50)
wall if you did like side events and (46:48 - 46:51)
everything at Worlds it was it was (46:50 - 46:53)
pretty awesome we had a bunch of unite (46:51 - 46:55)
people like who were just doing unite (46:53 - 46:57)
side events on cool down just to try to (46:55 - 46:59)
get enough tickets to go over and get (46:57 - 47:01)
the Jersey cool gosh I yeah I didn&#39;t (46:59 - 47:02)
know that at all I think I looked at the (47:01 - 47:05)
prize wall once or twice that weekend (47:02 - 47:08)
and um that&#39;s like I&#39;ve been to I&#39;ve (47:05 - 47:10)
been to what like six worlds I&#39;ve been (47:08 - 47:14)
to probably like 10 naic&#39;s or whatever (47:10 - 47:16)
they&#39;re called (47:14 - 47:18)
now um or what they used to be called (47:16 - 47:19)
yeah they&#39;re called n&#39;s now I think they (47:18 - 47:23)
were called um and I&#39;ve never I&#39;ve only (47:19 - 47:25)
done one side event in like all of those (47:23 - 47:26)
events just because I&#39;m always busy (47:25 - 47:28)
doing other stuff but it&#39;s cool it&#39;s (47:26 - 47:31)
like it is a cool thing to do if you&#39;re (47:28 - 47:33)
there is to just participate in side (47:31 - 47:35)
offense and then cash in your prizes (47:33 - 47:37)
yeah yeah unite has side events now I (47:35 - 47:39)
think niic was the first one we started (47:37 - 47:42)
doing them they they just they call them (47:39 - 47:44)
the solo queue tournaments you just you (47:42 - 47:46)
sign up you get randomly put onto a team (47:44 - 47:48)
of five and you just play three games (47:46 - 47:49)
best of one kind of thing like in a (47:48 - 47:52)
little Swiss format um and then they so (47:49 - 47:54)
they have those and then they have like (47:52 - 47:56)
the same format but like you can only (47:54 - 48:00)
choose starter Pokemon so like uh like (47:56 - 48:02)
the 10 available starter Pokemon we have (48:00 - 48:04)
in the game those are your only options (48:02 - 48:05)
like that kind of thing got it got it (48:04 - 48:08)
got it yeah so they they they rushed us (48:05 - 48:10)
back there and then they got photos of (48:08 - 48:13)
all of us uh in our jerseys cool like (48:10 - 48:15)
the same like the same exact photos that (48:13 - 48:17)
all the like professional unite people (48:15 - 48:18)
have I don&#39;t think they had time to use (48:17 - 48:19)
them I don&#39;t think they ever went up on (48:18 - 48:21)
stream or anything but they did yeah (48:19 - 48:24)
they did end up sending those to us so (48:21 - 48:26)
we can use for whatever awesome which is (48:24 - 48:27)
which is like really really cool and (48:26 - 48:30)
they turned out so well and uh whoever (48:27 - 48:32)
did the lighting cuz I felt like the (48:30 - 48:33)
photo room was like kind of pitch black (48:32 - 48:36)
and really dark except for the exact (48:33 - 48:38)
moment they take that picture right and (48:36 - 48:41)
then it&#39;s like perfect lighting it&#39;s (48:38 - 48:43)
like I want to hire that person to just (48:41 - 48:44)
come to my house and like fix my (48:43 - 48:47)
lighting here he&#39;s genuinely amazing (48:44 - 48:50)
photographer I uh I forget his first (48:47 - 48:52)
name now but I know yeah the (48:50 - 48:54)
photographer he works with Pokemon a lot (48:52 - 48:57)
like with he&#39;s been at neic and euic uh (48:54 - 49:00)
but he does a lot of um concerts as well (48:57 - 49:02)
like goes on tour with band quite a bit (49:00 - 49:03)
as well for (49:02 - 49:05)
video so at that point after the (49:03 - 49:07)
pictures were taken that&#39;s when they (49:05 - 49:10)
revealed that we&#39;re playing a brand new (49:07 - 49:13)
mode uh the 500 point mode and we&#39;re (49:10 - 49:14)
going to be playing that&#39;s crazy that (49:13 - 49:17)
that&#39;s when you learned that like that (49:14 - 49:20)
is so funny to me but okay continue I (49:17 - 49:21)
guess they didn&#39;t yeah didn&#39;t make you (49:20 - 49:24)
sign an NDA so they had to wait until (49:21 - 49:26)
that last second they&#39;re like literally (49:24 - 49:28)
15 minutes before we go on stage they (49:26 - 49:29)
didn&#39;t even tell us initially in like (49:28 - 49:31)
the the group chat that we were going on (49:29 - 49:35)
stage that was also not told to us so (49:31 - 49:36)
like the only thing we knew is we were (49:35 - 49:38)
getting jerseys as like a thank you gift (49:36 - 49:41)
and um that we were playing a new mode (49:38 - 49:43)
like being on stage didn&#39;t know we were (49:41 - 49:45)
playing on mobile phones like that was (49:43 - 49:47)
that was uhuh didn&#39;t know it was brand (49:45 - 49:50)
new mode um everything was in uh (49:47 - 49:53)
Mandarin I think right uh (49:50 - 49:56)
and before the thing I didn&#39;t talk about (49:53 - 49:58)
last week uh before we got into the (49:56 - 50:00)
actual game mode which everyone saw on (49:58 - 50:02)
stage there was like a a almost like a (50:00 - 50:05)
genin impact Lobby which we talked about (50:02 - 50:07)
a little bit before recording that&#39;s (50:05 - 50:10)
apparently standard in the Chinese (50:07 - 50:13)
version of unite yeah so it&#39;s like a (50:10 - 50:15)
little well yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s like open (50:13 - 50:16)
world effect as well right where like (50:15 - 50:18)
your character can kind of wander around (50:16 - 50:20)
is that am I right on that yeah yeah (50:18 - 50:23)
yeah yeah so that is in the beta there&#39;s (50:20 - 50:24)
like these little mini games you can (50:23 - 50:26)
play these little Arch arange I played (50:24 - 50:28)
basketball yeah like yeah arcade Hoops (50:26 - 50:31)
kind of thing get going on the tough (50:28 - 50:33)
part is the there was an announcement (50:31 - 50:34)
trailer I don&#39;t know if you know this (50:33 - 50:35)
there was like a little trailer right (50:34 - 50:37)
before you went on stage or like before (50:35 - 50:39)
your game store they were like we&#39;re (50:37 - 50:41)
you&#39;re going on after this trailer play (50:39 - 50:44)
great okay yeah so you see how these (50:41 - 50:49)
Productions go sometimes but it was um (50:44 - 50:51)
the only thing that&#39;s been advertised or (50:49 - 50:53)
that has been promised to come to the (50:51 - 50:56)
global version of the game is the Moe is (50:53 - 50:58)
the five 00 point mode that is coming to (50:56 - 51:01)
the game there is a bunch of stuff in (50:58 - 51:03)
the China version like emblems work and (51:01 - 51:05)
function completely differently held (51:03 - 51:07)
items work and function completely (51:05 - 51:10)
differently in kind of a cool and not so (51:07 - 51:12)
cool way I don&#39;t know I we could do an (51:10 - 51:14)
entire podcast episode on what the China (51:12 - 51:19)
version has and is um we can uh but then (51:14 - 51:21)
and then Pokemon have like every single (51:19 - 51:24)
Pokemon has kind of had like a mini (51:21 - 51:26)
rework for it to like function in this (51:24 - 51:30)
new mode um none of that of the last (51:26 - 51:33)
three things I said have been promised (51:30 - 51:37)
for our game only the 500 point mode has (51:33 - 51:38)
however we&#39;re starting to see some stuff (51:37 - 51:40)
but I know you don&#39;t like to talk about (51:38 - 51:42)
leaks or anything on the show so I will (51:40 - 51:44)
I will refrain from yeah yeah yeah I (51:42 - 51:46)
mean like when it&#39;s on like a public (51:44 - 51:49)
test server I feel like that&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s (51:46 - 51:51)
there right like it is a like anyone (51:49 - 51:52)
could sign up for it I don&#39;t know if (51:51 - 51:55)
you&#39;d want to sign up for it or what the (51:52 - 51:58)
Yeah the opinion of from I have a lot of (51:55 - 51:59)
content creator friends (51:58 - 52:02)
who you&#39;re downloading it you&#39;re VPN (51:59 - 52:05)
into it to like not China you that&#39;s (52:02 - 52:06)
really hard to get into that one I&#39;ve (52:05 - 52:08)
heard but the like the public test (52:06 - 52:10)
server is based out of I believe it&#39;s (52:08 - 52:13)
Thailand it might be Malaysia yeah but (52:10 - 52:15)
but anyway you the games are so horrific (52:13 - 52:17)
because of ping anyways you&#39;re just (52:15 - 52:19)
going into the practice mode to try the (52:17 - 52:21)
new character moves and get out like and (52:19 - 52:23)
like no games are actually getting (52:21 - 52:24)
finished because people are just there (52:23 - 52:27)
to test back out if they don&#39;t get the (52:24 - 52:29)
new Pokémon they&#39;re just getting out of (52:27 - 52:31)
the game anyway so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a (52:29 - 52:33)
nightmare over there I&#39;ve seen people (52:31 - 52:35)
ask for the public test server like in (52:33 - 52:38)
North America and stuff I&#39;m like maybe I (52:35 - 52:40)
just I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll really do what (52:38 - 52:42)
we want it to do but right right right (52:40 - 52:45)
right um so we were we were presented so (52:42 - 52:49)
we had the uh we had the Timmy is that (52:45 - 52:50)
how you say is it time it&#39;s Timmy is the (52:49 - 52:53)
Tim so Timmy is (52:50 - 52:57)
the developer correct of (52:53 - 53:00)
unite um and so they brought over I (52:57 - 53:02)
think there was four players uh four (53:00 - 53:04)
Chinese players and they were like they (53:02 - 53:05)
don&#39;t speak English that well but here&#39;s (53:04 - 53:10)
a translator we have nice uh and so it (53:05 - 53:13)
was a lot of just (53:10 - 53:15)
understanding like how to get into a (53:13 - 53:18)
game any questions about specific (53:15 - 53:20)
buttons that would be getting into a (53:18 - 53:22)
game and then making sure we could just (53:20 - 53:24)
pick our characters and like run through (53:22 - 53:27)
something like relatively s like easy (53:24 - 53:29)
we played like one game (53:27 - 53:32)
backstage (53:29 - 53:35)
and it seemed fine right and it was like (53:32 - 53:37)
if you didn&#39;t know what like there was (53:35 - 53:40)
three like boosts that popped up on the (53:37 - 53:43)
side uhhuh and they always said just (53:40 - 53:45)
like pick the one that was glowing (53:43 - 53:46)
because that would be the most (53:45 - 53:48)
beneficial to whatever your character (53:46 - 53:50)
was that&#39;s cool I actually didn&#39;t know (53:48 - 53:52)
that that happened that&#39;s really sweet I (53:50 - 53:54)
like yeah so do you want me to add a (53:52 - 53:56)
little bit of context of like what that (53:54 - 53:58)
is that system yeah yeah yeah totally (53:56 - 54:01)
okay so that system is personally my (53:58 - 54:03)
favorite I think what&#39;s GNA excite a lot (54:01 - 54:05)
of people about this new mode it&#39;s (54:03 - 54:07)
awesome so B they&#39;re calling it AOS (54:05 - 54:10)
technology um oh yes that&#39;s we need to (54:07 - 54:12)
figure out a better word for it we&#39;re (54:10 - 54:13)
talking we&#39;re we&#39;re determining what (54:12 - 54:15)
we&#39;re going to call it for shorthand (54:13 - 54:17)
because that is a mouthful um but like (54:15 - 54:18)
you get these basically upgrades (54:17 - 54:20)
throughout the match now you get them a (54:18 - 54:22)
different thresholds of your team&#39;s (54:20 - 54:26)
score so you get one at zero everyone (54:22 - 54:28)
just starts with one and basic from what (54:26 - 54:31)
it seems like it gives you a random (54:28 - 54:34)
selection of three options from a pool (54:31 - 54:37)
of about like five to eight depending on (54:34 - 54:39)
the category so like at zero there&#39;s (54:37 - 54:41)
like five to eight that it could be and (54:39 - 54:44)
at 50 so on and so forth um but the (54:41 - 54:46)
scores uh you get the upgrades at zero (54:44 - 54:49)
like I mentioned and then 50 (54:46 - 54:51)
100 200 and (54:49 - 54:54)
350 so by the end of it I believe you (54:51 - 54:56)
have five upgrades before the match will (54:54 - 54:58)
complete if you&#39;ve gotten to that 350 (54:56 - 55:01)
point mark and they can they have a huge (54:58 - 55:03)
range that they can do um oftentimes the (55:01 - 55:05)
early game ones are focused around (55:03 - 55:07)
experience in different ways one of them (55:05 - 55:09)
is you literally just get boosted to (55:07 - 55:13)
level four immediately um which is crazy (55:09 - 55:15)
uh to me that like that one&#39;s awesome (55:13 - 55:16)
but there&#39;s one that&#39;s like for the rest (55:15 - 55:18)
of the game when you knock out wild (55:16 - 55:20)
Pokemon you get like a boosted (55:18 - 55:22)
experience or like when you score (55:20 - 55:25)
automatically get one level but then (55:22 - 55:26)
that ability goes on cool down for like (55:25 - 55:28)
60 seconds or something it&#39;s like I (55:26 - 55:30)
don&#39;t know there they&#39;re really creative (55:28 - 55:32)
and then they get like more bizarre and (55:30 - 55:35)
crazy and strong the later you go on but (55:32 - 55:38)
it just incentivizes your team to get to (55:35 - 55:40)
these score thresholds to get these like (55:38 - 55:42)
upgrades uh and like power up throughout (55:40 - 55:45)
the match yeah so that was that was like (55:42 - 55:47)
hard to tell during any of the matches (55:45 - 55:49)
like or what they did what they did or (55:47 - 55:52)
what they were doing right uhhuh uh I Pi (55:49 - 55:55)
I picked um okay so before we get to the (55:52 - 55:57)
actual match we&#39;re like jumping at head (55:55 - 55:58)
which because there&#39;s just so much to (55:57 - 56:00)
talk about I&#39;m so sorry no that&#39;s (55:58 - 56:02)
totally cool uh so the new mode is (56:00 - 56:06)
pretty much 500 points and whoever gets (56:02 - 56:08)
500 points wins the match which the (56:06 - 56:10)
current mode especially for those who (56:08 - 56:12)
don&#39;t play unite or haven&#39;t played in a (56:10 - 56:14)
while is it&#39;s a 10-minute game no matter (56:12 - 56:17)
what unless somebody forfeits I guess um (56:14 - 56:19)
but whoever has the most points at the (56:17 - 56:23)
end of 10 minutes wins and that score of (56:19 - 56:25)
who has the most points is hidden (56:23 - 56:27)
throughout the 10 minutes (56:25 - 56:29)
yes um so this (56:27 - 56:32)
is 500 points the game is over whether (56:29 - 56:34)
that&#39;s in three minutes 5 minutes 10 (56:32 - 56:38)
minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes um I don&#39;t (56:34 - 56:40)
I can&#39;t see a match going 20 minutes but (56:38 - 56:44)
maybe you you could I had be pretty (56:40 - 56:47)
bizarre they had one China land (56:44 - 56:49)
tournament that I was able to like get (56:47 - 56:51)
vods off it took so long digging through (56:49 - 56:54)
Billy Billy to get footage of this (56:51 - 56:56)
tournament but eventually I found it and (56:54 - 56:58)
I I think the longest I ever saw a match (56:56 - 57:01)
go was like 13 or 14 minutes like it is (56:58 - 57:04)
it would be with the nature of those (57:01 - 57:07)
late game upgrades it would be pretty (57:04 - 57:09)
ridiculous for a match to go that long I (57:07 - 57:12)
think like that is that uh that sounds (57:09 - 57:14)
like I don&#39;t see that ever happening (57:12 - 57:15)
especially because I think your matches (57:14 - 57:17)
I don&#39;t think did any of them hit 10 (57:15 - 57:20)
minutes um I they told us we had time (57:17 - 57:23)
for three games unless a match unless (57:20 - 57:24)
there was technical issues or a match (57:23 - 57:25)
went long but we only we only ended up (57:24 - 57:28)
doing two so I&#39;m not oh okay the first (57:25 - 57:31)
match might have gone longer uh I came (57:28 - 57:34)
out for the second match oh okay I know (57:31 - 57:36)
in one of them you didn&#39;t even get to (57:34 - 57:38)
eight minutes because I remember Zapdos (57:36 - 57:40)
didn&#39;t even start spawning yet in the (57:38 - 57:42)
one match that was on stage so yeah I (57:40 - 57:43)
think that might have been the second (57:42 - 57:45)
match which was my match um okay gotcha (57:43 - 57:48)
cuz I I think I think we did steamroll (57:45 - 57:52)
the other team pretty yeah pretty easily (57:48 - 57:58)
because I picked CR um no cracked crra (57:52 - 57:58)
but uh we were we were told backstage (57:58 - 58:03)
that the the concept was 5 to 15 minutes (58:00 - 58:07)
for all games just vers the the 10 and (58:03 - 58:09)
um I think somebody said like oh is (58:07 - 58:11)
super similar to League of Legends which (58:09 - 58:13)
I didn&#39;t know about League of Legends is (58:11 - 58:17)
that a point based uh well less Point (58:13 - 58:20)
based but like instead of scoring you (58:17 - 58:21)
just do damage to towers and then once (58:20 - 58:23)
you break like the home Tower or in (58:21 - 58:25)
unite sense once you score enough in the (58:23 - 58:28)
home base uh then it destroys then you (58:25 - 58:30)
win the game so a similar effect of that (58:28 - 58:33)
you can try to break all the goal zones (58:30 - 58:35)
in one lane so that youself like a fast (58:33 - 58:36)
track all the way to the home base and (58:35 - 58:41)
score there uh and score a bunch but um (58:36 - 58:42)
I I don&#39;t know if that would really (58:41 - 58:43)
benefit you in this game mode but yeah (58:42 - 58:45)
more similar to League of Legends than (58:43 - 58:46)
unit is currently (58:45 - 58:48)
absolutely but League of Legend games (58:46 - 58:52)
also last like 40 some yeah on the yeah (58:48 - 58:54)
you start talking DOTA that&#39;s like the (58:52 - 58:57)
early side so yeah for (58:54 - 59:02)
sure uh the yeah so uh there were new (58:57 - 59:06)
items or held items I think I my held (59:02 - 59:09)
item on my karant was like a heart or (59:06 - 59:11)
something I don&#39;t know what it did since (59:09 - 59:14)
I can&#39;t read manderin but um I don&#39;t (59:11 - 59:16)
battle item do you mean like the one (59:14 - 59:18)
acate sorry the battle item yes I know I (59:16 - 59:20)
you&#39;re saying eject button was built (59:18 - 59:23)
into everyone now at this point yeah the (59:20 - 59:27)
score button right yeah so that that is (59:23 - 59:29)
one feature that I am not sure if it is (59:27 - 59:31)
going to make it over into the global (59:29 - 59:35)
mode I it could I could I&#39;m not too sure (59:31 - 59:37)
but basically yeah this new one everyone (59:35 - 59:39)
has access to eject button it&#39;s like a (59:37 - 59:41)
targetable dash on your score button (59:39 - 59:42)
which is interesting because now you (59:41 - 59:45)
can&#39;t do it on an enemy goal Zone either (59:42 - 59:47)
like you if you have like you won&#39;t be (59:45 - 59:48)
able to do it because it&#39;ll just become (59:47 - 59:50)
the score button right right right right (59:48 - 59:53)
but yeah that was like the hardest part (59:50 - 59:54)
wasn&#39;t like the changes or wasn&#39;t the (59:53 - 59:56)
language it was just like the little (59:54 - 59:58)
thing of that are just a little bit (59:56 - 60:00)
changed yeah that are especially on like (59:58 - 60:02)
a touch screen because I&#39;m so used to a (60:00 - 60:05)
controller total side question because (60:02 - 60:07)
you&#39;ve commentated all the high-end (60:05 - 60:09)
matches is eject button still the number (60:07 - 60:11)
one item and very dominant I say so I I (60:09 - 60:14)
mean yeah we do see variety uh I I was (60:11 - 60:15)
actually talking with somebody about (60:14 - 60:17)
this I think at Worlds the only ones we (60:15 - 60:21)
didn&#39;t see were like um like fluffy I (60:17 - 60:23)
keep wanting to call it our like (60:21 - 60:26)
nicknames for them but fluffy hand and (60:23 - 60:27)
um gold (60:26 - 60:28)
like the only two I think we didn&#39;t see (60:27 - 60:30)
at all in the tournament but like yeah a (60:28 - 60:33)
jack button is the primary um item that (60:30 - 60:36)
you&#39;ll see it it&#39;s just too good (60:33 - 60:38)
offensively and defensively right but (60:36 - 60:40)
there are some Pokemon that really like (60:38 - 60:42)
full heal like if you&#39;re uh a squishier (60:40 - 60:45)
dive Pokemon that wants to uh you know (60:42 - 60:46)
be able to throw down for a little bit (60:45 - 60:48)
longer crat can make X attack work like (60:46 - 60:50)
that is a genuine option for cram Rand (60:48 - 60:52)
if you want to make it work but a ja&#39;s (60:50 - 60:55)
really nice on CR as well you can do it (60:52 - 60:57)
mid unite move it&#39;s really really good (60:55 - 60:59)
but yeah we see some we see some a (60:57 - 61:00)
little bit of (60:59 - 61:04)
variety yeah so 500 point mode uh I (61:00 - 61:07)
think another change was when you (61:04 - 61:11)
defeated Zapdos it would then fly over (61:07 - 61:14)
to the home base yeah so yeah so at (61:11 - 61:16)
eight minutes points are no longer (61:14 - 61:18)
doubled in the uh after eight minutes as (61:16 - 61:20)
well that&#39;s like a big that&#39;s a big (61:18 - 61:22)
change from the current game that we (61:20 - 61:25)
have now to this new game mode instead (61:22 - 61:27)
uh at 8 minutes Zapdos does spawn in (61:25 - 61:29)
when you def when a team defeats Zapdos (61:27 - 61:32)
or last hits it it will walk towards the (61:29 - 61:35)
closest goal Zone like so either top or (61:32 - 61:38)
bottom if there are no goal zones orning (61:35 - 61:39)
just the home base it&#39;ll just walk (61:38 - 61:41)
through the enemy Central Area uh (61:39 - 61:44)
towards it now Zapdos works like it does (61:41 - 61:47)
in the catch him quick mode I don&#39;t know (61:44 - 61:49)
if you&#39;ve ever played that at all but it (61:47 - 61:52)
doesn&#39;t score itself uh it just it walks (61:49 - 61:53)
up to a goal Zone when it gets within (61:52 - 61:56)
range it shoots the goal Zone um and (61:53 - 61:59)
then continues to do so and it doesn&#39;t (61:56 - 62:00)
score any points but it just makes that (61:59 - 62:03)
goal Zone an instant score for anybody (62:00 - 62:07)
who&#39;s standing on it um ROM also spawn (62:03 - 62:09)
in this map but not where they used to (62:07 - 62:11)
on Old remote Stadium they now spawn in (62:09 - 62:14)
in the top and bottom path where the (62:11 - 62:17)
swabl alteras do currently uh they spawn (62:14 - 62:19)
in at one minute into the game and then (62:17 - 62:21)
every minute afterwards they also work (62:19 - 62:23)
like the quick modes do currently where (62:21 - 62:25)
if you knock out a ROM it&#39;ll just walk (62:23 - 62:27)
towards an enemy gold Zone and works (62:25 - 62:29)
just like Zapdos it won&#39;t score any (62:27 - 62:31)
points itself but it&#39;ll shoot the enemy (62:29 - 62:33)
go Zone and make it defenseless the only (62:31 - 62:37)
difference is ROM goes away once it (62:33 - 62:40)
shoots a goal Zone Zapdos stays there (62:37 - 62:43)
and um and persists its effect if you if (62:40 - 62:44)
the enemy team doesn&#39;t knock out Zapdos (62:43 - 62:47)
for the second time oh I see I see I see (62:44 - 62:49)
and then I noticed the reggies were (62:47 - 62:52)
spawning where like the not where the (62:49 - 62:55)
cfish was but a little bit more yeah no (62:52 - 62:56)
I think well in the top side yeah with (62:55 - 62:58)
the corish is but like where the indides (62:56 - 63:02)
are on the bottom path now it&#39;s uh so on (62:58 - 63:04)
the bottom side it&#39;ll be there&#39;s a the (63:02 - 63:06)
bottom path is a reg of Steel on both (63:04 - 63:08)
sides now and they&#39;re much smaller so (63:06 - 63:10)
the reggies are smaller have less HP (63:08 - 63:12)
they&#39;re like in DD size they are it&#39;s (63:10 - 63:15)
kind of adorable um and their H uh their (63:12 - 63:18)
buff rather only goes to the Pokemon (63:15 - 63:19)
that knocks it out it&#39;s not team wide (63:18 - 63:22)
any longer so if you knock out Regis (63:19 - 63:23)
steel only the person who knocked out (63:22 - 63:26)
Regis steel gets that bonus oh okay I (63:23 - 63:29)
had no clue cuz again I I couldn&#39;t read (63:26 - 63:31)
any of the uh I know yeah I mean I don&#39;t (63:29 - 63:32)
even know if that information would be (63:31 - 63:35)
but yeah then and then on top side it&#39;s (63:32 - 63:37)
random if it&#39;s Reggie Rock or reg ice (63:35 - 63:39)
only one will spawn in the middle so (63:37 - 63:42)
that&#39;ll be that&#39;ll be the big like first (63:39 - 63:44)
roll out we contest over that one if (63:42 - 63:45)
we&#39;re in playing the top path against (63:44 - 63:46)
each other that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to (63:45 - 63:49)
try to chase down uh they&#39;re slightly (63:46 - 63:53)
changed um regir rock gives a defense (63:49 - 63:57)
buff and uh and oh and that&#39;s what it is (63:53 - 63:59)
regir rock and re ice both now upgrade (63:57 - 64:01)
your maximum HP if you knock it out for (63:59 - 64:03)
the remainder of the game um but if you (64:01 - 64:05)
knock out regir rock it gives you a (64:03 - 64:07)
passive defense buff like while it&#39;s on (64:05 - 64:09)
a cool down if you knock out reg ice (64:07 - 64:12)
it&#39;s a passive uh special defense buff (64:09 - 64:14)
no longer healing kind of a little a (64:12 - 64:16)
little bit different can (64:14 - 64:19)
you I think I think there&#39;s obviously I (64:16 - 64:22)
I saw people super excited that a new (64:19 - 64:24)
mode was coming I saw people excited (64:22 - 64:26)
that it was like 500 points and instead (64:24 - 64:28)
of 10 minutes yeah I saw people excited (64:26 - 64:31)
that like it doesn&#39;t seem so lopsided (64:28 - 64:35)
based on Zapdos being in the center yeah (64:31 - 64:38)
uh and then I saw people on the opposite (64:35 - 64:40)
side being upset that they would have to (64:38 - 64:44)
like relearn the game yeah my personal (64:40 - 64:47)
opinion playing two games was I didn&#39;t (64:44 - 64:49)
feel like I had to like relearn anything (64:47 - 64:51)
it felt like (64:49 - 64:56)
unite um but I I think the if there a (64:51 - 64:58)
meta around this that meta would be (64:56 - 65:01)
different of like Pokemon you pick and (64:58 - 65:05)
stuff yeah no I agree with you I so what (65:01 - 65:07)
I&#39;ve been saying for a little bit around (65:05 - 65:09)
this mode ever since we&#39;ve kind of got (65:07 - 65:10)
first eyes on it with the beta and then (65:09 - 65:12)
now we got to see you play it and (65:10 - 65:13)
probably the iteration that&#39;s going to (65:12 - 65:16)
be closest to what we get in Spring um (65:13 - 65:19)
I&#39;ve been saying this for a while I I am (65:16 - 65:21)
a big fan of the changes the the change (65:19 - 65:23)
from How The Ray quazo or zaptos fight (65:21 - 65:25)
used to work compared to the end game (65:23 - 65:27)
now I think is so much better it&#39;s not (65:25 - 65:30)
all dependent on one team fight if you (65:27 - 65:31)
lose that team fight they knock out (65:30 - 65:33)
Zapdos that&#39;s okay you have a chance to (65:31 - 65:35)
respawn defend against the zaptos take (65:33 - 65:37)
them down and get the next one you know (65:35 - 65:39)
like it&#39;s not over you can kind of keep (65:37 - 65:42)
fighting which is great um and what I (65:39 - 65:44)
think what they did well is when you see (65:42 - 65:47)
that the game is over at 500 points you (65:44 - 65:49)
like your mind instantly jumps to like (65:47 - 65:51)
the horrors that were score comp back in (65:49 - 65:53)
the day like it was pretty common like (65:51 - 65:55)
in competitive play and even in ranked (65:53 - 65:57)
play like where people would just ignore (65:55 - 65:58)
fights and just run and score score (65:57 - 66:00)
score as much as they could try to the (65:58 - 66:02)
end of the game but what they&#39;ve done to (66:00 - 66:03)
alleviate that I think it was pretty (66:02 - 66:06)
smart is they have flooded the map with (66:03 - 66:09)
objectives like we just talked about how (66:06 - 66:10)
there&#39;s three different reggies (66:09 - 66:13)
basically all the time double the ROM we (66:10 - 66:14)
didn&#39;t even talk about the middle (66:13 - 66:16)
objectives of Reggie Ali or Reggie Drago (66:14 - 66:18)
like there are just so many things to (66:16 - 66:21)
fight for that give you big advantages (66:18 - 66:23)
that like if a team is going to just try (66:21 - 66:25)
to ignore you and score they are going (66:23 - 66:27)
to be playing in a bigger deficit than (66:25 - 66:30)
they ever have which um I think is (66:27 - 66:33)
pretty smart and it keeps that like (66:30 - 66:36)
nature of what keeps unite unique um (66:33 - 66:39)
unit is z MOA more than any other game (66:36 - 66:42)
in this genre is All About Last hitting (66:39 - 66:44)
like League of Legends or Dota or (66:42 - 66:46)
something um the Minions that walk down (66:44 - 66:48)
the path your enemy can&#39;t hit them to (66:46 - 66:50)
get experience like they can&#39;t hit their (66:48 - 66:53)
own to get experience right you you (66:50 - 66:54)
canest over theirs and they test over (66:53 - 66:58)
yours but unite every single wild (66:54 - 67:00)
Pokemon is contestable so like you&#39;re (66:58 - 67:03)
always trying to get the last hit and (67:00 - 67:05)
deny your opponent experience and then (67:03 - 67:08)
in turn gain your own so I like how they (67:05 - 67:10)
kind of kept that nature really well in (67:08 - 67:13)
this new mode and I think it uh it does (67:10 - 67:16)
still feel like unite the big criticism (67:13 - 67:17)
everybody&#39;s saying right now is that (67:16 - 67:19)
it&#39;s just really chaotic because the map (67:17 - 67:21)
is just so full and there&#39;s so much (67:19 - 67:23)
stuff and that is true but like for me (67:21 - 67:27)
it was chaotic cuz I couldn&#39;t read well (67:23 - 67:29)
yep that is true uh sometimes you just (67:27 - 67:30)
got to hit your buttons and hope for the (67:29 - 67:33)
best but is that so different than unite (67:30 - 67:36)
now St right right I think I think there (67:33 - 67:38)
was also I I haven&#39;t even watched my (67:36 - 67:39)
performance I would love to go back and (67:38 - 67:42)
watch it but because I&#39;ll do a V review (67:39 - 67:43)
uh you you do a VOD review on the (67:42 - 67:45)
patreon if your own gameplay that&#39; be (67:43 - 67:49)
great it should but I kept um I went (67:45 - 67:52)
dive airr rant and then I kept uh (67:49 - 67:54)
misplaying or or diving the wrong way (67:52 - 67:56)
just cuz I&#39;m not used to the touch (67:54 - 67:59)
screen oh mobile controls yeah yeah yeah (67:56 - 68:01)
so that that was like and plus like the (67:59 - 68:03)
nervousness of being streamed and on (68:01 - 68:05)
State on the main stage of everyone of (68:03 - 68:07)
like how did that feel to be on the big (68:05 - 68:10)
stage uh it was that in itself was such (68:07 - 68:14)
a cool experience just like with the w (68:10 - 68:16)
with the headsets and the controls in (68:14 - 68:18)
front of you and having people like walk (68:16 - 68:20)
back and forth making sure everything is (68:18 - 68:25)
good um that that like there is there&#39;s (68:20 - 68:27)
just like another perspective I have of (68:25 - 68:29)
just like being up there um and like oh (68:27 - 68:31)
yeah I heard you guys talking about like (68:29 - 68:33)
the white noise and stuff on uh last (68:31 - 68:35)
episode uh it&#39;s primarily there so (68:33 - 68:38)
players don&#39;t cheat it it would be a (68:35 - 68:41)
pretty absurd thing to happen but like (68:38 - 68:43)
you don&#39;t see score in the current game (68:41 - 68:45)
mode right so people could be like (68:43 - 68:47)
yelling like you&#39;re ahead or you&#39;re (68:45 - 68:50)
behind you know at like big moments and (68:47 - 68:53)
so the game is like or that&#39;s the design (68:50 - 68:56)
of it like you see it all the time and (68:53 - 68:57)
other games like like Call of Duty&#39;s a (68:56 - 68:59)
big one like where you&#39;re or like (68:57 - 69:01)
valerant like when someone is like (68:59 - 69:03)
disarming the bomb or something like (69:01 - 69:05)
they like they don&#39;t want that&#39;s why you (69:03 - 69:06)
have that noise in the headset they (69:05 - 69:08)
don&#39;t want the crowd helping the players (69:06 - 69:10)
on stage that&#39;s that&#39;s the main intent I (69:08 - 69:12)
I was hard to explain to Bobby and (69:10 - 69:15)
Hannah how loud that white noise is oh (69:12 - 69:16)
yeah it&#39;s way more than normal noise (69:15 - 69:18)
cancelling headphones I heard them (69:16 - 69:19)
talking about that it is way more than (69:18 - 69:22)
that it is a genuine like buzzing sound (69:19 - 69:25)
so players will have like inar buds to (69:22 - 69:27)
like hear game and each other and then (69:25 - 69:30)
they&#39;ll have like the headset over that (69:27 - 69:32)
will be giving that like buzz sound yeah (69:30 - 69:34)
it was it was a little jarring at first (69:32 - 69:35)
of like it takes some getting used to (69:34 - 69:37)
for sure right of like like I think like (69:35 - 69:39)
two or three minutes in the game it it (69:37 - 69:40)
felt like it normalized but I was just (69:39 - 69:44)
I&#39;m like trying to hear everyone um talk (69:40 - 69:46)
and then also like the game audio for (69:44 - 69:48)
like the audio cues and translate the (69:46 - 69:50)
Mandarin real (69:48 - 69:53)
quick of course no I heard the ugly (69:50 - 69:55)
calls were were really helping you that (69:53 - 69:57)
was good ugly beautiful very very (69:55 - 70:01)
helpful uh but yeah though that makes (69:57 - 70:03)
more sense that I I didn&#39;t have that (70:01 - 70:05)
context that they were like content (70:03 - 70:08)
creators that Timmy picked because they (70:05 - 70:11)
knew the mode insanely well they knew (70:08 - 70:13)
exactly what to do they knew they knew (70:11 - 70:16)
what was good for the other so we had I (70:13 - 70:19)
think two players from China on our team (70:16 - 70:20)
and then the other team had two players (70:19 - 70:22)
from China if I remember correctly so (70:20 - 70:25)
they wanted to cancel out the Pokemon (70:22 - 70:27)
that they knew the other team was good (70:25 - 70:29)
at oh awesome so they knew one of the (70:27 - 70:31)
players over there loved buzzball so (70:29 - 70:33)
they were like buzzball ugly ugly ugly (70:31 - 70:36)
oh yeah get rid of it and then I think I (70:33 - 70:38)
think Greninja was the other one that (70:36 - 70:39)
yeah that one&#39;s been really popular in (70:38 - 70:42)
the beta too did you notice any of the (70:39 - 70:45)
like level reworks or anything like when (70:42 - 70:47)
you were I you&#39;re not playing you&#39;re not (70:45 - 70:48)
playing an evolving Pokemon you&#39;re (70:47 - 70:50)
playing crams you might not noticed it (70:48 - 70:53)
but like eeve evolve at like two Wiggly (70:50 - 70:56)
tff evolves at like level three now (70:53 - 70:59)
are crazy different which is again a (70:56 - 71:02)
detail I don&#39;t know if it will come over (70:59 - 71:05)
because I&#39;m like 99 to 100% confident (71:02 - 71:06)
the game you were playing was just the (71:05 - 71:09)
current Chinese beta like that was the (71:06 - 71:12)
game you were playing I am like again (71:09 - 71:14)
the only thing they have promised us is (71:12 - 71:16)
the game mode not the entirety of the (71:14 - 71:18)
game as much as I would love it there&#39;s (71:16 - 71:20)
an electrode volleyball mini game in (71:18 - 71:23)
there that I want to play so flipping (71:20 - 71:25)
bad but oh there like a dust devil (71:23 - 71:27)
Battle Royale game there&#39;s a lot of cool (71:25 - 71:29)
stuff that I would really like uh so I&#39;m (71:27 - 71:32)
hoping the one the one thing I noticed (71:29 - 71:33)
and maybe it was just I was playing on (71:32 - 71:35)
mobile but the menu system felt smooth (71:33 - 71:38)
and fluid yeah you got to play on mobile (71:35 - 71:41)
Steve I can&#39;t you got to abandon ship on (71:38 - 71:44)
the switch version I just the second (71:41 - 71:46)
mobile will let me pair a Bluetooth (71:44 - 71:49)
controller to it fair enough fair enough (71:46 - 71:53)
there is well what I got the impression (71:49 - 71:54)
like watching the open world and stuff (71:53 - 71:56)
and I&#39;m really curious on how it fail to (71:54 - 71:59)
play but I first thought was that&#39;s not (71:56 - 72:02)
working on the switch I saw like moving (71:59 - 72:05)
around it&#39;s like no shot does that work (72:02 - 72:06)
on the current version of this game on (72:05 - 72:08)
the switch but yeah how did um I I&#39;m (72:06 - 72:10)
just curious in the general like I&#39;ve (72:08 - 72:11)
been just spitting out information about (72:10 - 72:14)
the game but like how&#39;d it feel like did (72:11 - 72:16)
you enjoy it did you not like what were (72:14 - 72:20)
you thinking oh yeah I I wanted to play (72:16 - 72:22)
more it really I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know like (72:20 - 72:24)
you see these competitive games like (72:22 - 72:26)
OverWatch and then you see OverWatch (72:24 - 72:27)
where they&#39;re like instead of six (72:26 - 72:28)
characters you have five characters and (72:27 - 72:30)
this dramatically changes the game and (72:28 - 72:31)
then you also hear that a lot of people (72:30 - 72:33)
don&#39;t like it and that it didn&#39;t feel (72:31 - 72:34)
like an (72:33 - 72:37)
upgrade I I could see people making that (72:34 - 72:41)
comparison to unite and I have not (72:37 - 72:43)
nearly as many hours in unite as other (72:41 - 72:46)
people I think I think I hit like 400 (72:43 - 72:47)
hours which I think is a lot for any (72:46 - 72:51)
video game 400 hours in a video game is (72:47 - 72:52)
a lot but it (72:51 - 72:57)
did make me super excited if this mode (72:52 - 73:00)
is the future of unite because one I do (72:57 - 73:01)
think it&#39;s more (73:00 - 73:05)
accessible I think knowing that uh a (73:01 - 73:07)
game can just go five minutes if it was (73:05 - 73:09)
a complete like one-sided thing and it (73:07 - 73:11)
was like okay we completely got (73:09 - 73:13)
destroyed that&#39;s fine and also it makes (73:11 - 73:15)
me excited of like there&#39;s been so many (73:13 - 73:19)
games where if we just had like 30 more (73:15 - 73:21)
seconds or if we just had just another (73:19 - 73:24)
minute we could have definitely won that (73:21 - 73:28)
or or or stood up and I don&#39;t I think 10 (73:24 - 73:30)
minutes is long to dedicate to a game (73:28 - 73:32)
but I don&#39;t think anyone who&#39;s like man (73:30 - 73:34)
if I just like had 30 more seconds would (73:32 - 73:37)
be also upset of like oh that game took (73:34 - 73:38)
11 minutes it&#39;s like no I&#39;m glad that (73:37 - 73:40)
game gave us another (73:38 - 73:42)
minute yeah that&#39;s a really interesting (73:40 - 73:44)
perspective because I think you&#39;re right (73:42 - 73:46)
there are so many moments in unite which (73:44 - 73:48)
that like yeah if you could just make (73:46 - 73:51)
one more play if they didn&#39;t just rip (73:48 - 73:52)
something then maybe we could have like (73:51 - 73:55)
turned it around but now that&#39;s a little (73:52 - 73:57)
different I don&#39;t know it uh it&#39;s super (73:55 - 74:00)
exciting for like my perspective on it I (73:57 - 74:03)
mean mine&#39;s a little more I don&#39;t know (74:00 - 74:05)
in know weird SP like weird spot because (74:03 - 74:06)
I&#39;m a commentator which obviously is not (74:05 - 74:08)
going to be the like popular way to look (74:06 - 74:11)
at it but like as a commentator and (74:08 - 74:14)
toold it&#39;s no secret that like the the (74:11 - 74:16)
player base of unite is not where it (74:14 - 74:17)
once was right like we had that huge (74:16 - 74:19)
Spike around Mewtwo when it came out and (74:17 - 74:21)
then it was Giga broken and everyone (74:19 - 74:24)
hated it uh then things were pretty (74:21 - 74:26)
rough after that (74:24 - 74:28)
so like we just need something big and (74:26 - 74:31)
new like I I&#39;m like all aboard getting (74:28 - 74:33)
on this new mode because I think it&#39;s so (74:31 - 74:36)
interesting as a commentator this will (74:33 - 74:38)
be difficult matches to cast just (74:36 - 74:40)
because there is it is like it the (74:38 - 74:42)
criticism of it being chaotic whether (74:40 - 74:46)
it&#39;s a fair criticism it is a true point (74:42 - 74:48)
it is like there&#39;s so much stuff going (74:46 - 74:50)
on lots of action um so our approach to (74:48 - 74:52)
the game will have to be different but I (74:50 - 74:55)
don&#39;t know I I am very very excited (74:52 - 74:57)
about it it&#39;s sounds so fun I&#39;m hoping (74:55 - 75:00)
we get like more not less of the changes (74:57 - 75:02)
in the Chinese beta mode of the game (75:00 - 75:04)
because a lot of them are really (75:02 - 75:07)
exciting and really cool do you know how (75:04 - 75:10)
the audience in China feels about this (75:07 - 75:11)
mode (75:10 - 75:14)
I not sure I&#39;ve seen a little bit of (75:11 - 75:16)
discourse the tough part is that&#39;s the (75:14 - 75:19)
only mode um that they have at the time (75:16 - 75:21)
they don&#39;t they don&#39;t have our the sky (75:19 - 75:24)
ruins in the game there is no mode that (75:21 - 75:26)
ends like that it&#39;s just this version (75:24 - 75:28)
of the game uh I think it&#39;s done pretty (75:26 - 75:30)
decently in streaming numbers I mean (75:28 - 75:32)
China&#39;s kind of all about Pokemon right (75:30 - 75:34)
now you know dcg launching there (75:32 - 75:37)
currently and like um yeah unit seems to (75:34 - 75:40)
be seems to be doing quite well um so I (75:37 - 75:42)
think pretty positive it&#39;s just like (75:40 - 75:44)
typical MOBA game discourse like blank (75:42 - 75:45)
is broken like when are they going to (75:44 - 75:48)
fix this Pokemon like you know but that (75:45 - 75:50)
happens in literally every game of this (75:48 - 75:53)
genre so I like I totally get when when (75:50 - 75:54)
they put up us when they put us on stage (75:53 - 75:57)
I totally get got the we missing an (75:54 - 76:00)
important match for bracket totally (75:57 - 76:03)
understood that like um those complaint (76:00 - 76:05)
worthy I think it&#39;s a worthy change at (76:03 - 76:08)
this point like I mean we got to show it (76:05 - 76:10)
off like it&#39;s it&#39;s exciting but yeah (76:08 - 76:12)
sorry I cut you off what what were you (76:10 - 76:14)
say no no no no I I just I just think (76:12 - 76:17)
like the the the watching of unite even (76:14 - 76:19)
if you don&#39;t play I think it&#39;s really (76:17 - 76:22)
easy to watch mhm yeah uh and that&#39;s (76:19 - 76:25)
what makes like I always compare TCG to (76:22 - 76:28)
like watching Golf and and especially (76:25 - 76:30)
with like my audience like I&#39;ll switch (76:28 - 76:35)
between like TCG or VGC or unite and (76:30 - 76:36)
it&#39;s pretty easy for somebody to watch (76:35 - 76:38)
like fgc or unite because they (76:36 - 76:39)
understand that this Pokemon has (76:38 - 76:41)
defeated this Pokemon this waterm move (76:39 - 76:43)
hits this fire Pokemon that&#39;s why that (76:41 - 76:46)
fire Pokemon dies with TCG it&#39;s like I (76:43 - 76:47)
have no clue what&#39;s happening I can&#39;t (76:46 - 76:50)
read the cards and it goes my much much (76:47 - 76:52)
slower it&#39;s got to be better though with (76:50 - 76:55)
that cool new layout they debuted though (76:52 - 76:57)
I don&#39;t know it looked it looked sick at (76:55 - 76:59)
least a little better I thought the TCG (76:57 - 77:00)
layout was pretty sweet they debut to (76:59 - 77:03)
Worlds but but but with not but with (77:00 - 77:06)
unite it&#39;s so easy to watch it&#39;s so easy (77:03 - 77:08)
to see those high energy moments (77:06 - 77:12)
compared to other games so it&#39;s like (77:08 - 77:15)
besides them adding your favorite (77:12 - 77:17)
Pokemon which would probably push people (77:15 - 77:18)
over the edge to be like okay I&#39;m going (77:17 - 77:20)
to try unite because they finally added (77:18 - 77:22)
Grim snarl and Grim snarl is my favorite (77:20 - 77:25)
Pokemon um I do feel like what do we (77:22 - 77:28)
year three of you they that kind of have (77:25 - 77:32)
to do something for sure to get another (77:28 - 77:34)
audience to come in because I don&#39;t (77:32 - 77:35)
think I I mean you&#39;ll see the comments (77:34 - 77:37)
of like this mode will is going to (77:35 - 77:38)
change everything I don&#39;t think that&#39;s (77:37 - 77:40)
necessarily true but I don&#39;t think the (77:38 - 77:42)
current mode is (77:40 - 77:46)
really enticing anyone new to join oh my (77:42 - 77:48)
gosh yeah completely agree (77:46 - 77:52)
I I know the like the counterpoints of (77:48 - 77:53)
that I guess would be like League hasn&#39;t (77:52 - 77:55)
changed its map like in forever but (77:53 - 77:57)
they&#39;ve updated their map they they have (77:55 - 77:59)
changed mechanics of it but like they (77:57 - 78:00)
played on the same map forever blah blah (77:59 - 78:03)
blah it&#39;s just we&#39;re in a mobile market (78:00 - 78:05)
like that is a completely different (78:03 - 78:07)
Beast uh that to to fight within like (78:05 - 78:08)
you (78:07 - 78:11)
are fighting for time and like a (78:08 - 78:13)
bajillion applications that everybody (78:11 - 78:15)
has on their phone and it&#39;s you know (78:13 - 78:17)
it&#39;s a tough space to be in and so I (78:15 - 78:20)
think new bigger better is is really (78:17 - 78:22)
exciting and yeah I&#39;m down and we (78:20 - 78:25)
already broke the in case of emergency m (78:22 - 78:29)
to release so we need we did it twice so (78:25 - 78:33)
we need something big um the I don&#39;t (78:29 - 78:35)
know I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s too many (78:33 - 78:36)
comp like people interested in (78:35 - 78:38)
competitive unite that that listen to (78:36 - 78:40)
the podcast but if there are (78:38 - 78:43)
um it&#39;s releasing in Spring which will (78:40 - 78:46)
most likely be like kind of the midpoint (78:43 - 78:49)
of the competitive season next year so I (78:46 - 78:52)
would be shocked if it if this is the (78:49 - 78:54)
competitive mode next year I like I (78:52 - 78:55)
don&#39;t think that it will be mented I (78:54 - 78:58)
think in like 2026 season it would be (78:55 - 79:00)
the main competitive like I don&#39;t think (78:58 - 79:02)
they would switch up the entire game at (79:00 - 79:04)
the midpoint of the season if they did (79:02 - 79:06)
it would be like I don&#39;t know it&#39; be (79:04 - 79:08)
crazy it would definitely throw things (79:06 - 79:11)
uh out of whack but um knowing the (79:08 - 79:12)
changes they&#39;ve done and everything I (79:11 - 79:14)
don&#39;t think that would be the case but (79:12 - 79:16)
the game will be the game mode will be (79:14 - 79:19)
coming to the game in Spring regardless (79:16 - 79:21)
and Grassroots tournaments and stuff to (79:19 - 79:23)
to play and enjoy it with so this this (79:21 - 79:25)
seems very much like a Pokemon (79:23 - 79:28)
day announcement of like here here (79:25 - 79:31)
here&#39;s the date here&#39;s three new Pokemon (79:28 - 79:36)
coming here&#39;s whatever else to it yeah (79:31 - 79:37)
whatever legendary we get for Pokemon (79:36 - 79:40)
day which won&#39;t be ex anymore very (79:37 - 79:43)
excited about that but uh that&#39;s going (79:40 - 79:44)
to be the big change for competitive (79:43 - 79:46)
next year all of a sudden all the cool (79:44 - 79:47)
legendary Pokemon will finally be (79:46 - 79:50)
available yeah yeah um I guess I guess (79:47 - 79:52)
two more questions before we wrap up (79:50 - 79:55)
first one is how did the other comp s (79:52 - 79:56)
feel or sorry how did the other (79:55 - 79:58)
commentators feel about this (79:56 - 80:01)
mode uh I think everybody&#39;s pretty (79:58 - 80:02)
positive on it like I think we&#39;re all (80:01 - 80:04)
aligned of like yeah we just want like (80:02 - 80:05)
we&#39;re excited about new like it like (80:04 - 80:08)
bring us like something to be pumped (80:05 - 80:10)
about I guess and that is what this mode (80:08 - 80:14)
is pulling off um yeah as commentators (80:10 - 80:16)
it is a little bit of Uncharted (80:14 - 80:18)
Territory but it&#39;s excited territory so (80:16 - 80:20)
yeah I think I think pretty positive got (80:18 - 80:23)
it and uh last question is compared to (80:20 - 80:25)
other worlds how did you feel (80:23 - 80:28)
this Championship championship series (80:25 - 80:32)
went oh that&#39;s a good question um I (80:28 - 80:34)
think extremely positive in a lot of (80:32 - 80:37)
ways uh it&#39;s you and I are both from (80:34 - 80:39)
North America we&#39;re backto back world (80:37 - 80:42)
champions but no longer uh Japan took (80:39 - 80:45)
the throne this year uh it was a it was (80:42 - 80:47)
actually kind of crazy seven out of (80:45 - 80:49)
eight teams in top eight were from Asia (80:47 - 80:51)
and there was one team from latam South (80:49 - 80:54)
that was holding it down for the West in (80:51 - 80:55)
top eight and then they made it to top (80:54 - 80:59)
four but um but the meta game was super (80:55 - 81:01)
exciting uh I thought the meta was (80:59 - 81:02)
really really good for this world (81:01 - 81:04)
championships made for great games like (81:02 - 81:06)
day one and day two I thought the games (81:04 - 81:08)
were just like we had very few just (81:06 - 81:10)
nothing games you know they were all (81:08 - 81:11)
very exciting felt like they could go (81:10 - 81:14)
either way so that was great so many (81:11 - 81:15)
regions really stepped up to the plate (81:14 - 81:19)
so I think extremely positively um in (81:15 - 81:21)
terms of the games and and unite and (81:19 - 81:24)
honestly we had so few Tech issues so (81:21 - 81:25)
from our side of things too that felt (81:24 - 81:28)
pretty good there was one can I tell a (81:25 - 81:30)
really super I&#39;ll make a super quick no (81:28 - 81:32)
you to take all the time you want (81:30 - 81:34)
wonders Chef tweeted about this but I I (81:32 - 81:36)
didn&#39;t know if anybody knew in the game (81:34 - 81:38)
three of the grand finals one team&#39;s up (81:36 - 81:41)
20 also so this could be the like world (81:38 - 81:43)
championship game of unite in this (81:41 - 81:45)
series the match starts and they have (81:43 - 81:48)
like a freak issue backstage where the (81:45 - 81:50)
Observer and the backup the first (81:48 - 81:52)
observers game uh their like rig not (81:50 - 81:54)
even the game of unit but their whole (81:52 - 81:55)
rig crashes (81:54 - 81:56)
like during that game so they&#39;re first (81:55 - 81:57)
Observer stand so they&#39;re onto the (81:56 - 82:00)
backup Observer and the backup Observer (81:57 - 82:02)
has like a unite end issue where they&#39;re (82:00 - 82:05)
having crazy frame drops like like the (82:02 - 82:07)
game is like almost looking like (82:05 - 82:10)
slideshow territory and so we&#39;re in like (82:07 - 82:13)
oh no what&#39;s gonna happen and they look (82:10 - 82:16)
over and the Japanese Observer who is (82:13 - 82:19)
observing by the way just on a phone (82:16 - 82:21)
holding it down with just their finger (82:19 - 82:23)
on the screen moving the camera around (82:21 - 82:25)
and that&#39;s that&#39;s the Observer that&#39;s (82:23 - 82:26)
has been working the B stage basically (82:25 - 82:30)
all day um but he was just like doing it (82:26 - 82:32)
and they they&#39;re like we got that third (82:30 - 82:35)
Camp put him up put him up and they and (82:32 - 82:36)
they threw it on and then the game was (82:35 - 82:38)
like fixed and the crowd went wild when (82:36 - 82:40)
the frame DRFT stopped it was really (82:38 - 82:42)
funny um but he&#39;s going and someone was (82:40 - 82:44)
like should we tell him and they&#39;re like (82:42 - 82:46)
do not tell him he is observing this (82:44 - 82:49)
game right now like do not stress him (82:46 - 82:52)
out and then after the game finished (82:49 - 82:55)
like the whole production team like Che (82:52 - 82:57)
and erupted and our director went and (82:55 - 82:59)
hugged him and he&#39;s like what&#39;s (82:57 - 83:00)
happening and they put on Google (82:59 - 83:03)

one&#39;s using tub (88:25 - 88:30)
either get and I get to go to am I going (88:27 - 88:35)
to like the wild brain app and then in (88:30 - 88:38)
the app I&#39;m then picking the Pokemon (88:35 - 88:40)
only (88:38 - 88:43)
Channel which will then have Pokemon on (88:40 - 88:49)
it yeah I remember so there was a time I (88:43 - 88:52)
want to say it was like seven eight (88:49 - 88:56)
years ago when dis Disney had all of the (88:52 - 88:59)
Pokemon seasons M they had them on their (88:56 - 89:03)
Disney XD app and you would uh you could (88:59 - 89:05)
open that app and then it was just like (89:03 - 89:07)
here&#39;s all the Disney IP right and like (89:05 - 89:09)
and the other shows that they have that (89:07 - 89:11)
are that they somehow got access to and (89:09 - 89:14)
there was like a Pokemon Channel (89:11 - 89:16)
essentially you clicked on that and then (89:14 - 89:17)
all of a sudden it was like here&#39;s all (89:16 - 89:20)
the episodes like seasons one through (89:17 - 89:21)
whatever it was at that time I think it (89:20 - 89:24)
went to like sun and moon and then and (89:21 - 89:26)
then also had movies too on the Disney (89:24 - 89:27)
XD app they had like they would switch (89:26 - 89:29)
them out but they would have movies you (89:27 - 89:31)
could watch as well on there I assume (89:29 - 89:32)
this will work similarly right like (89:31 - 89:35)
you&#39;ll open up their app there will be (89:32 - 89:38)
here&#39;s Sonic here&#39;s Super Mario here&#39;s (89:35 - 89:40)
Pokemon click there and then you just (89:38 - 89:44)
have access to all of those 22 seasons (89:40 - 89:48)
of the show with ads with ads with ads (89:44 - 89:55)
with ads yeah because ads scale (89:48 - 89:55)
yeah I don&#39;t know I mean I&#39;ve never (89:56 - 90:00)
used (89:59 - 90:04)
this app service whatever uh so I don&#39;t (90:00 - 90:06)
know you&#39;re not over here watching k (90:04 - 90:09)
Caillou no isn&#39;t it is it that is that (90:06 - 90:12)
what it how it&#39;s pronounced yes is it (90:09 - 90:14)
Caillou yep that&#39;s how that&#39;s pronounced (90:12 - 90:17)
uh no I am (90:14 - 90:17)
not you&#39;re not watching the (90:18 - 90:24)
grassy not since I was a teenager but I (90:21 - 90:26)
used to watch grass is a real standout (90:24 - 90:29)
cuz like Caillou and T Tubi is (90:26 - 90:31)
definitely like children children (90:29 - 90:34)
programming M de Grassi is like more (90:31 - 90:38)
like Middle School yeah yeah that was (90:34 - 90:40)
definitely big deg Grassi the Next (90:38 - 90:43)
Generation fan back in the (90:40 - 90:47)
day but yeah I don&#39;t know also Inspector (90:43 - 90:50)
Gadget are they is that they still (90:47 - 90:51)
making like new episodes of Inspector (90:50 - 90:54)
Gadget or yeah I think so I think (90:51 - 90:57)
where they nice just have like different (90:54 - 91:00)
variations or different reboots of it (90:57 - 91:02)
love that back in the day too it&#39;s great (91:00 - 91:04)
maybe I should jump in on this I I don&#39;t (91:02 - 91:06)
know how to like again to your point (91:04 - 91:08)
though like is it a wild brain app I (91:06 - 91:09)
mean I&#39;m looking on like the App Store (91:08 - 91:11)
like just to see if there&#39;s a way like (91:09 - 91:14)
or if it&#39;s only on like TV SM (91:11 - 91:17)
TVs yeah because if it&#39;s only on Smart (91:14 - 91:20)
TVs I am even less happy with this (91:17 - 91:23)
decision um yeah that&#39;s well the Poke (91:20 - 91:26)
the M the Pokemon company has been very (91:23 - 91:28)
good at (91:26 - 91:32)
selling their licensing rights to (91:28 - 91:35)
channels and then eventually getting it (91:32 - 91:37)
back Disney a great example Disney XD (91:35 - 91:39)
had it for x amount of years and then (91:37 - 91:41)
they got it back and then they sold it (91:39 - 91:43)
to somebody else and then they get it (91:41 - 91:45)
back and they sell it to somebody else (91:43 - 91:48)
so obviously not the first company in (91:45 - 91:51)
the world that has done this we saw like (91:48 - 91:53)
Seinfeld move from like Hulu to Netflix (91:51 - 91:55)
and that was like one of the biggest (91:53 - 91:59)
licensing deals ever just to get that (91:55 - 92:02)
there I&#39;m assuming (91:59 - 92:05)
that the Pokemon company got a big chunk (92:02 - 92:07)
of money from Wild (92:05 - 92:12)
brain to hold on to these episodes for x (92:07 - 92:13)
amount of time who knows if this is a (92:12 - 92:15)
one-year deal two-year deal threeyear (92:13 - 92:19)
deal with the agreement that after 3 (92:15 - 92:21)
years they get it back and they can sell (92:19 - 92:24)
it to somebody else um but then wild (92:21 - 92:25)
brand (92:24 - 92:27)
is hoping that it can make its money (92:25 - 92:31)
back through ads right oh yeah I mean (92:27 - 92:34)
that&#39;s how that works yeah and I&#39;m sure (92:31 - 92:35)
they will be able (92:34 - 92:39)
to uh probably it looks like they&#39;re not (92:35 - 92:41)
getting everything though that was sold (92:39 - 92:45)
to Netflix right cuz like was it G and (92:41 - 92:48)
forward is all Netflix yeah I was about (92:45 - 92:49)
to say when I first heard these (92:48 - 92:51)
announcements I thought that it was (92:49 - 92:53)
going to have something to do with the (92:51 - 92:55)
fact that all of the Pokemon Journeys (92:53 - 92:59)
episodes are leaving Netflix soon yeah (92:55 - 93:02)
very soon like September (92:59 - 93:05)
7th that is very soon how many episodes (93:02 - 93:09)
are there Pokemon Journeys uh a lot it&#39;s (93:05 - 93:11)
everything Ash did right before all of (93:09 - 93:13)
the ash episodes stopped well based on (93:11 - 93:16)
the uh episode list earlier probably (93:13 - 93:17)
around (93:16 - 93:20)
140 time to binge time to binge watch (93:17 - 93:22)
Pokemon (93:20 - 93:23)
Journeys but we don&#39;t know where those (93:22 - 93:24)
are going to end (93:23 - 93:26)
right right they&#39;re clearly not going to (93:24 - 93:28)
Wild brain (93:26 - 93:31)
yeah uh by the way I looked it up and (93:28 - 93:35)
there is a wildbrain iPad app but not an (93:31 - 93:37)
iPhone app so I that&#39;s what you need (93:35 - 93:40)
though the the the the kids have I look (93:37 - 93:43)
I went to a park for Mega Rayquaza and (93:40 - 93:46)
the amount of young children running (93:43 - 93:49)
around with fullon iPads was mindblowing (93:46 - 93:50)
to (93:49 - 93:54)
me well they yeah I don&#39;t know (93:50 - 93:58)
iPads don&#39;t like what like they they (93:54 - 94:01)
work for forever so you can definitely (93:58 - 94:04)
break them though they can they can you (94:01 - 94:05)
put them in a nice sturdy case though (94:04 - 94:08)
you&#39;re good to go and they just they (94:05 - 94:10)
just seem to last a long time I mean (94:08 - 94:12)
like so I get it I get handing a kid an (94:10 - 94:14)
iPad over like a a phone with cellular (94:12 - 94:16)
service and everything well okay so (94:14 - 94:18)
Netflix right now (94:16 - 94:20)
has the (94:18 - 94:22)
horizons and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s doing (94:20 - 94:25)
pretty well (94:22 - 94:27)
um it must must like they went from (94:25 - 94:28)
Journeys to Horizons so they must have (94:27 - 94:30)
been very happy with Journeys to then (94:28 - 94:34)
resign Horizons and then they have (94:30 - 94:37)
concierge and apparently concierge was (94:34 - 94:38)
good enough where they were going to (94:37 - 94:42)
they&#39;re making more concierge although (94:38 - 94:43)
who knows when we&#39;re going to hear about (94:42 - 94:45)
that maybe Pokemon day we&#39;ll hear about (94:43 - 94:48)
the second set of concierge episodes the (94:45 - 94:52)
interesting thing is there was no (94:48 - 94:55)
trainer tour for (94:52 - 94:57)
Netflix that got that was that was (94:55 - 94:59)
Amazon Prime that that (94:57 - 95:04)
was Prime video SL Roku Roku yeah Roku (94:59 - 95:08)
TV has it for free uh I don&#39;t know where (95:04 - 95:10)
I heard this from but I heard this in (95:08 - 95:13)
passing at the World Championships that (95:10 - 95:16)
they tried to sell (95:13 - 95:19)
trainer bus what was the trainer tour (95:16 - 95:22)
trainer tour to Netflix and Netflix said (95:19 - 95:24)
no they didn&#39;t want it which is wild cuz (95:22 - 95:27)
it gives off really really big queer eye (95:24 - 95:30)
Vibes I watch the whole thing yeah oh (95:27 - 95:33)
really yeah that was the main thing it (95:30 - 95:34)
reminded me of maybe I just don&#39;t watch (95:33 - 95:38)
enough reality TV but serious I was told (95:34 - 95:41)
at one point that it was like very queer (95:38 - 95:45)
eye like but but Pokemon yeah someone (95:41 - 95:47)
said this when we were when we were (95:45 - 95:49)
talking about it a couple weeks ago (95:47 - 95:51)
someone mentioned I think I might have (95:49 - 95:54)
cut that part out of the episode okay (95:51 - 95:56)
yeah I remember talking about that like (95:54 - 95:58)
similarities there between the two I&#39;m (95:56 - 96:01)
glad I&#39;m glad Hannah Felt This Way (95:58 - 96:04)
watching I have not watched it yet same (96:01 - 96:06)
yeah I mean the the intro sequences the (96:04 - 96:09)
way the episodes are laid out the entire (96:06 - 96:14)
purpose of the episodes is weirdly (96:09 - 96:16)
similar it&#39;s I mean you you you look at (96:14 - 96:19)
a structure of a TV show and you go that (96:16 - 96:20)
clearly (96:19 - 96:24)
works yeah that&#39;s just the restructure (96:20 - 96:27)
our show like that yep it&#39;s just instead (96:24 - 96:30)
of having the goal of helping someone&#39;s (96:27 - 96:33)
like sphere of life including where they (96:30 - 96:37)
live and how they look and their (96:33 - 96:40)
relationships it is instead people (96:37 - 96:43)
somehow doing little bits of all of that (96:40 - 96:45)
while also teaching them how to play (96:43 - 96:47)
Pokemon (96:45 - 96:47)
TCG it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s good to have (96:48 - 96:53)
on in the background if that&#39;s what I if (96:51 - 96:55)
what heard was true that they tried to (96:53 - 96:59)
sell trainer tour to Netflix and Netflix (96:55 - 97:04)
passed I wonder why because I feel (96:59 - 97:07)
like I feel like a weird show they (97:04 - 97:08)
already have queer ey they don&#39;t want it (97:07 - 97:10)
to (97:08 - 97:10)
compete I I feel like (97:10 - 97:17)
uh Netflix is really good at just (97:13 - 97:21)
wanting new things and really good at (97:17 - 97:24)
not renewing what already exists because (97:21 - 97:26)
usually new things are more likely to (97:24 - 97:30)
bring somebody in than like season 30 of (97:26 - 97:32)
that Game of Thrones or whatever part of (97:30 - 97:33)
it there&#39;s also the fact that after I (97:32 - 97:36)
think three seasons a show gets more (97:33 - 97:37)
expensive you have to pay the actors (97:36 - 97:39)
more so I think that&#39;s a lot of what (97:37 - 97:40)
happens with Netflix yeah that&#39;s why (97:39 - 97:44)
they cancel so many of their shows yeah (97:40 - 97:45)
yeah (97:44 - 97:50)
um but that&#39;s also it also feels (97:45 - 97:53)
like if Netflix doesn&#39;t want your show (97:50 - 97:55)
Almost feels like some sort of like (97:53 - 97:58)
rejection like this is not good enough (97:55 - 98:00)
for us especially when so many of the (97:58 - 98:02)
newer Pokemon things have been on (98:00 - 98:04)
Netflix well I will say so I&#39;m I&#39;m (98:02 - 98:06)
looking right now at what Pokemon things (98:04 - 98:09)
are on Netflix and so they&#39;ve got (98:06 - 98:12)
they&#39;ve got um the Indigo League uh they (98:09 - 98:14)
have Pokemon Horizons and then they have (98:12 - 98:17)
detective Pikachu they have the Mewtwo (98:14 - 98:19)
Strikes Back uh Evolution the one that (98:17 - 98:23)
was like the exclusive to Netflix okay (98:19 - 98:24)
uh oh yeah you&#39;re right (98:23 - 98:26)
almost all of these are Netflix ex (98:24 - 98:29)
exclusives including Journeys detective (98:26 - 98:32)
Pikachu I said almost oh almost okay I (98:29 - 98:34)
they said all I I they said all of these (98:32 - 98:37)
uh detective Pikachu was exclusive to (98:34 - 98:41)
HBO Max at first but yeah now it&#39;s on (98:37 - 98:44)
Netflix uh Pokemon concierge Pokemon the (98:41 - 98:47)
archus Chronicles that was Netflix (98:44 - 98:49)
exclusive Y Pokemon the movie secrets of (98:47 - 98:53)
the Jungle I think CU joury exive to (98:49 - 98:55)
Netflix yeah literally everything is (98:53 - 98:57)
Netflix exclusive except for detective (98:55 - 99:01)
Pikachu and indigo Le yeah well and so (98:57 - 99:03)
my point to this is like all of this is (99:01 - 99:05)
animated none of this is anything that&#39;s (99:03 - 99:10)
like Pokemon but like real people (99:05 - 99:12)
trainer tour is different in that way so (99:10 - 99:15)
it&#39;s possible that they just didn&#39;t want (99:12 - 99:18)
they have their formula for what they (99:15 - 99:21)
have for Pokemon stuff and it is all (99:18 - 99:24)
animated none of it is like live show (99:21 - 99:26)
though what&#39;s up that&#39;s still happening (99:24 - 99:28)
though right they&#39;re still making (99:26 - 99:29)
they&#39;re still trying to make a (99:28 - 99:32)
liveaction Pokemon show is Netflix the (99:29 - 99:34)
one that&#39;s taking that yep I believe (99:32 - 99:38)
Netflix is I wonder if the if Netflix (99:34 - 99:40)
values things I think I think they do (99:38 - 99:42)
but I I I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t work for (99:40 - 99:43)
Netflix I wonder if Netflix values (99:42 - 99:45)
things that are rewatchable so my (99:43 - 99:48)
question to Hannah is would you reatch (99:45 - 99:52)
trainer tour now that you&#39;ve seen it no (99:48 - 99:54)
I mean maybe I would put it on the (99:52 - 99:56)
background just to have someone talking (99:54 - 99:58)
while I was cleaning my place or (99:56 - 100:00)
something like that but (99:58 - 100:03)
there&#39;s maybe if you&#39;re trying to (100:00 - 100:05)
actively learn how to play the (100:03 - 100:09)
TCG you could rewatch it but other than (100:05 - 100:13)
that not really because like (100:09 - 100:15)
kids or even I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s (100:13 - 100:18)
really a kids show I mean kind of I (100:15 - 100:20)
don&#39;t really know who the audience is (100:18 - 100:23)
for this show for the trainer tour if (100:20 - 100:27)
it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s (100:23 - 100:32)
weird H May yeah that&#39;s people they (100:27 - 100:36)
focus on are of many ages there are kids (100:32 - 100:38)
who are in the focus of episodes and (100:36 - 100:39)
then there are adults who are the focus (100:38 - 100:41)
of episodes there are people my age (100:39 - 100:44)
there are people your age there are (100:41 - 100:47)
there&#39;s a there&#39;s a girl who was uh like (100:44 - 100:49)
first year high school wrestler and I I (100:47 - 100:51)
felt that cuz I was also a wrestler in (100:49 - 100:53)
high school and that was really cool to (100:51 - 100:55)
see in a Pokemon show (100:53 - 100:59)
um but I I don&#39;t know who the audience (100:55 - 101:01)
is maybe maybe that&#39;s why Netflix was (100:59 - 101:03)
like ah who who are we trying to Market (101:01 - 101:06)
this towards yeah I know the Strawberry (101:03 - 101:09)
17 one of the hosts like Megan her last (101:06 - 101:11)
name is very hard for me to pronounce so (101:09 - 101:14)
I don&#39;t want to ruin it uh I know Megan (101:11 - 101:16)
was at the world championships and she (101:14 - 101:21)
was on stage at one point um and she was (101:16 - 101:24)
really talking up trainer to her (101:21 - 101:28)
which I&#39;m sure she was brought there too (101:24 - 101:30)
like I believe her flight and hotel and (101:28 - 101:34)
everything was was paid for (101:30 - 101:34)
um I I don&#39;t know if she was primarily (101:35 - 101:40)
brought to words to talk up trainer to (101:38 - 101:44)
her I don&#39;t know if it was (101:40 - 101:47)
like you need to talk it up or she just (101:44 - 101:49)
felt the need to talk it up because she (101:47 - 101:51)
worked on it and she was one of the (101:49 - 101:56)
hosts but she sure did talk it up a lot (101:51 - 102:00)
um so I don&#39;t know if there was I don&#39;t (101:56 - 102:02)
I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s like they want (102:00 - 102:06)
to do a season two or I could definitely (102:02 - 102:09)
see them doing a season two if it got (102:06 - 102:11)
enough support right it&#39;s a show that (102:09 - 102:15)
could grow if Amazon wants to yeah pay (102:11 - 102:18)
for a season two it&#39;s a weird show but I (102:15 - 102:20)
mean there are Parts I really liked (102:18 - 102:23)
about it I just didn&#39;t didn&#39;t know who (102:20 - 102:25)
it was didn&#39;t (102:23 - 102:28)
know I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know it&#39;s a (102:25 - 102:30)
weird show that&#39;s that&#39;s the main thing (102:28 - 102:33)
I have to say I kind of feel that way (102:30 - 102:35)
about concierge though I think concierge (102:33 - 102:37)
is kind of a weird (102:35 - 102:41)
show like when we talk about like most (102:37 - 102:44)
pokemon animated things are like geared (102:41 - 102:46)
towards kids I think one there there&#39;s a (102:44 - 102:50)
clear distinction between kids shows and (102:46 - 102:54)
like the other kids shows (102:50 - 102:57)
Like Caillou is not the same as like (102:54 - 103:00)
Power Rangers like I would say Power (102:57 - 103:03)
Rangers was like for me as a 10-year-old (103:00 - 103:06)
like the show I wanted to watch like (103:03 - 103:08)
Power Rangers like 10 11 12 but like as (103:06 - 103:11)
a 10-year-old I&#39;m not watching Caillou (103:08 - 103:14)
or I&#39;m not watching Clifford the Big Red (103:11 - 103:16)
Dog or I&#39;m not watching telletubbies so (103:14 - 103:17)
I do feel like when we throw around the (103:16 - 103:23)
term kid show that that&#39;s so General we (103:17 - 103:24)
should go with the the way books do it (103:23 - 103:26)
and have kids books and young adult (103:24 - 103:28)
books and have kids shows and young (103:26 - 103:30)
adult shows yeah yeah so like I&#39;ve (103:28 - 103:32)
always considered Pokemon like the show (103:30 - 103:35)
for like eighty olds or 10 year olds or (103:32 - 103:37)
like 12 year olds (103:35 - 103:41)
where telletubbies is like six year (103:37 - 103:44)
olds or younger or younger yeah yeah (103:41 - 103:46)
Bobby you have a better idea of this (103:44 - 103:48)
well so of course I mean there are (103:46 - 103:50)
different like it&#39;s a lot easier when (103:48 - 103:52)
you think of if you just are breaking it (103:50 - 103:54)
into two categories where thinking like (103:52 - 103:57)
a show for adults or a show for kids (103:54 - 103:59)
right obviously there&#39;s a lot of range (103:57 - 104:01)
there with children&#39;s TV you know (103:59 - 104:03)
because you have babies you have (104:01 - 104:07)
toddlers you have you know kids that are (104:03 - 104:10)
between you know four and seven eight (104:07 - 104:11)
years old and you know I mean like (104:10 - 104:13)
there&#39;s a lot of difference there in (104:11 - 104:16)
that and so sure you probably aren&#39;t (104:13 - 104:18)
going to have the same kids (104:16 - 104:21)
watching Teletubbies that are also (104:18 - 104:23)
watching (104:21 - 104:25)
Power Rangers but you might I mean (104:23 - 104:27)
that&#39;s not to say that that&#39;s not you (104:25 - 104:30)
know it&#39;s it&#39;s hard I I really don&#39;t (104:27 - 104:32)
want to get into what like shows kids (104:30 - 104:34)
should be watching because I parents get (104:32 - 104:38)
very very a certain way about this stuff (104:34 - 104:41)
so I like to stay out of that but going (104:38 - 104:44)
back to concierge like I don&#39;t feel like (104:41 - 104:49)
concierge is like a telletubbies SL (104:44 - 104:52)
Caillou show no my kids did watch coner (104:49 - 104:55)
though think it was (104:52 - 104:58)
boring they thought it was more boring (104:55 - 105:00)
than my kids have also watched like (104:58 - 105:02)
Pokemon right like that just the regular (105:00 - 105:04)
show like Indigo League right so they (105:02 - 105:08)
thought it was more boring than that but (105:04 - 105:10)
they weren&#39;t they were interested in it (105:08 - 105:14)
okay watch four episodes U cuz cuz I&#39;ve (105:10 - 105:16)
like babysat like like my nieces and (105:14 - 105:18)
nephews and if you like put on a movie (105:16 - 105:20)
and they don&#39;t like it it&#39;s very obvious (105:18 - 105:21)
they will like get up and like just (105:20 - 105:24)
leave yeah that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s great (105:21 - 105:27)
about kids is that they are just they&#39;re (105:24 - 105:28)
not going to sit through something they (105:27 - 105:30)
don&#39;t want to sit through yeah they they (105:28 - 105:32)
will just like get up and leave and so (105:30 - 105:35)
like I feel like concierge would be that (105:32 - 105:37)
show for like younger kids to be like ah (105:35 - 105:40)
this is kind of slow this is kind of (105:37 - 105:43)
boring not that I think it&#39;s not Acy but (105:40 - 105:46)
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily (105:43 - 105:46)
slow I think it&#39;s paced a little slow (105:47 - 105:53)
compared comparatively yeah compared to (105:50 - 105:55)
like normal Pokémon yes yeah yeah but (105:53 - 105:57)
like I don&#39;t think that&#39;s bad but I (105:55 - 105:58)
could see that being a turnoff for some (105:57 - 106:00)
people to be like Ah that&#39;s a little (105:58 - 106:02)
slow even as an adult I&#39;m like ah this (106:00 - 106:04)
is a little (106:02 - 106:04)
slow I don&#39;t know my kids en enjoyed it (106:04 - 106:11)
but they but to your point it it was not (106:08 - 106:14)
as I don&#39;t think they weren&#39;t as into it (106:11 - 106:19)
as Pokemon the anime like the yeah I (106:14 - 106:21)
mean the relatability in concierge is (106:19 - 106:23)
definitely more more geared towards (106:21 - 106:28)
adults yes yeah agreed yeah and my kids (106:23 - 106:31)
would have zero interest in trainer tour (106:28 - 106:32)
you think just because of the type of (106:31 - 106:35)
show it is like which is fine like but (106:32 - 106:37)
but you don&#39;t think the cards are a good (106:35 - 106:41)
enough like hook as as as you as their (106:37 - 106:43)
father collects cards and then they see (106:41 - 106:46)
the cards the TV show if anything if the (106:43 - 106:48)
audience is for anyone it would be maybe (106:46 - 106:50)
families who are trying to learn how to (106:48 - 106:52)
play TCG together but also I don&#39;t know (106:50 - 106:55)
if families watch reality shows together (106:52 - 106:58)
watch I watch Survivor with my parents (106:55 - 107:00)
okay I didn&#39;t grow up watching reality (106:58 - 107:04)
shows yeah I watched like the survivors (107:00 - 107:06)
and The Amazing Race and the Big (107:04 - 107:08)
Brothers shows with my parents but that (107:06 - 107:10)
was like more teenage years that wasn&#39;t (107:08 - 107:12)
I wasn&#39;t yeah that was like more teenage (107:10 - 107:14)
we wer watching like real world when I (107:12 - 107:17)
was six and my parents you (107:14 - 107:19)
know I don&#39;t think anyone should be (107:17 - 107:21)
watching real (107:19 - 107:23)
world uh no (107:21 - 107:27)
um I don&#39;t know I mean yeah my kids we (107:23 - 107:29)
don&#39;t watch reality TV together as a (107:27 - 107:32)
family again my kids there seven and (107:29 - 107:37)
four so uh you know it&#39;s just not what (107:32 - 107:39)
we&#39;re watching together (107:37 - 107:41)
but yeah I don&#39;t (107:39 - 107:44)
think I don&#39;t know I again I have to (107:41 - 107:45)
really I have to really go and watch (107:44 - 107:46)
trainer tour because I just really (107:45 - 107:49)
watched the the trailer for it and it (107:46 - 107:51)
just seems very much geared (107:49 - 107:54)
toward in my opinion it just feels like (107:51 - 107:56)
it&#39;s it&#39;s geared toward older kids and (107:54 - 107:59)
then into adults more so than like young (107:56 - 108:03)
children as most I think most reality TV (107:59 - 108:04)
I don&#39;t know that there is really any (108:03 - 108:08)
reality TV that&#39;s geared toward young (108:04 - 108:08)
children maybe I&#39;m wrong I don&#39;t pay to (108:09 - 108:14)
very much reality TV be interested in (108:12 - 108:16)
what reality TV that is I&#39;d like to (108:14 - 108:17)
watch that to see if there&#39;s actually (108:16 - 108:19)
reality TV geared toward young children (108:17 - 108:22)
but would I was going to say like the (108:19 - 108:25)
floor is lava but that&#39;s more game show (108:22 - 108:26)
than reality (108:25 - 108:31)
TV mhm yeah yeah I don&#39;t yeah which (108:26 - 108:33)
makes me think why is there not a (108:31 - 108:36)
Pokemon game (108:33 - 108:36)
show that I could get behind there are (108:36 - 108:42)
occasionally episodes that kind of feel (108:40 - 108:44)
like (108:42 - 108:44)
it (108:47 - 108:52)
yeah uh some scarlet and violet news uh (108:48 - 108:56)
right now the it&#39;s until uh Sunday (108:52 - 108:57)
September 1st so when you&#39;re listening (108:56 - 108:59)
to this you still have time uh the Seven (108:57 - 109:04)
Star Dragonite is appearing in the raid (108:59 - 109:07)
battles right now it is normal Tera I (109:04 - 109:11)
have raid builds up for that uh on (109:07 - 109:14)
YouTube if you need Pokemon (109:11 - 109:17)
suggestions um and then the mass (109:14 - 109:21)
outbreak event are lar Larvitar and beon (109:17 - 109:23)
uh they will be appearing in both games (109:21 - 109:26)
that was a frequent question (109:23 - 109:28)
of violet and Scarlet users cuz they are (109:26 - 109:31)
version exclusive normally but they will (109:28 - 109:32)
they do appear in both games uh they&#39;re (109:31 - 109:35)
in mass outbreaks for Pala G and huian (109:32 - 109:40)
SLU uh in kakami so first time huian suu (109:35 - 109:43)
is catchable outside of Legends archus (109:40 - 109:45)
obviously if you catch the goom and you (109:43 - 109:46)
try to evolve it it will evolve into (109:45 - 109:49)
Goodra if you catch the slugo Hui and (109:46 - 109:51)
SLU and you evolve it you will get the (109:49 - 109:55)
huian Goodra so if you don&#39;t own Legends (109:51 - 109:57)
archus and you&#39;re listening to the (109:55 - 109:59)
podcast this podcast one that&#39;s kind of (109:57 - 110:04)
weird uh but two (109:59 - 110:04)
weird if you&#39;re listening to a Pokemon (110:04 - 110:08)
podcast in a Pokemon (110:06 - 110:11)
Drought right now we haven&#39;t had a new (110:08 - 110:13)
game in a long time you can&#39;t always get (110:11 - 110:15)
every game not everyone can always get (110:13 - 110:17)
every game Let&#39;s rearrange this if (110:15 - 110:18)
you&#39;re listening to a Pokemon podcast in (110:17 - 110:21)
a Pokemon Drought and you would like a (110:18 - 110:23)
Pokemon game to play and have the means (110:21 - 110:26)
to do so I would suggest picking up (110:23 - 110:28)
Legends aru if you haven&#39;t played it yet (110:26 - 110:30)
because it is a very fun game and then (110:28 - 110:32)
you can also get Hui and if you have (110:30 - 110:35)
Prime video you can watch Trader tour (110:32 - 110:37)
right (110:35 - 110:37)
now uh and then in in in the terrarium (110:38 - 110:45)
uh you can catch Beldum these Pokemon do (110:42 - 110:47)
have the increased shiny chance I don&#39;t (110:45 - 110:48)
know what they are off the top of my (110:47 - 110:51)
head but I posted the the shiny graphic (110:48 - 110:52)
on Instagram and Twitter and all that (110:51 - 110:55)
stuff um and then these Pokemon also (110:52 - 110:57)
have increased chance of having the (110:55 - 111:01)
charismatic Mark so all the Pokemon you (110:57 - 111:03)
catch in the mass outbreaks will have a (111:01 - 111:05)
5% chance to have the charismatic (111:03 - 111:09)
Mark and that is also going (111:05 - 111:14)
until Sunday September 1st I like this (111:09 - 111:16)
uh Pokemon I like these Pokemon spawns I (111:14 - 111:19)
think this is a really good combination (111:16 - 111:21)
of Pokemon I will say I couldn&#39;t find (111:19 - 111:24)
any Hui and SLU the other day when I was (111:21 - 111:27)
looking in kakami which is weird I just (111:24 - 111:29)
saw a bunch of Gom everywhere but so hu (111:27 - 111:32)
and suu is spawning separately from G (111:29 - 111:34)
right so you&#39;ll you&#39;ll see an outbreak (111:32 - 111:38)
of just Hui and SLU yes okay I I didn&#39;t (111:34 - 111:40)
look very hard but probably just had a (111:38 - 111:43)
bad role yeah probably um because I was (111:40 - 111:45)
thinking I wanted to get through I want (111:43 - 111:49)
I don&#39;t have a shiny Hui and SLU or (111:45 - 111:52)
gooder yet so I was looking forward to (111:49 - 111:55)
shiny hunting (111:52 - 111:55)
yeah the the the Dragonite raid is kind (111:55 - 112:01)
of cool (111:59 - 112:04)
because it is I think the first one (112:01 - 112:06)
since Charizard that has eight moves (112:04 - 112:07)
which is a (112:06 - 112:10)
lot um a lot of (112:07 - 112:12)
the we&#39;ve seen Seven Star raids with (112:10 - 112:14)
like five moves or most of them have (112:12 - 112:16)
like six moves six moves seems to be (112:14 - 112:19)
like the average but (112:16 - 112:24)
um they it does a cool like (112:19 - 112:24)
thematically it&#39;s really cool because it (112:24 - 112:27)
sets rain dance even though it doesn&#39;t (112:26 - 112:29)
have any water type moves and it&#39;s not (112:27 - 112:32)
weak to fire but the rain dance is cool (112:29 - 112:34)
because it lets it do 100% accuracy (112:32 - 112:38)
hurricane and 100% accuracy Thunder and (112:34 - 112:41)
when I say 100% it&#39;s (112:38 - 112:45)
like not 100% it&#39;s like it cannot miss (112:41 - 112:47)
it&#39;s like a it&#39;s like a weird (112:45 - 112:51)
distinction in Pokemon where it&#39;s like (112:47 - 112:53)
hurricane in the rain just even if you (112:51 - 112:56)
sand attack it like 30 times it just it (112:53 - 113:00)
cannot miss when rain is up (112:56 - 113:02)
so that&#39;s cool because it takes (113:00 - 113:03)
advantage of its special attack but it (113:02 - 113:05)
only does that for like the first couple (113:03 - 113:07)
turns and then it switches over to the (113:05 - 113:09)
physical move set of like extreme speed (113:07 - 113:11)
and earthquake (113:09 - 113:14)
and so (113:11 - 113:16)
like whether or not somebody thinks oh (113:14 - 113:17)
man I gosh this is the hardest raid ever (113:16 - 113:19)
or oh my gosh this is the easiest raid (113:17 - 113:20)
ever which is really funny to me cuz (113:19 - 113:22)
every seven star raid you see that where (113:20 - 113:24)
somebody&#39;s like it&#39;s just so hard and (113:22 - 113:26)
then somebody else is like it&#39;s so easy (113:24 - 113:28)
which is I think is like a good sign of (113:26 - 113:32)
like balance I guess (113:28 - 113:34)
sure uh so whether whether you think (113:32 - 113:36)
it&#39;s too hard or too easy I think (113:34 - 113:39)
thematically it&#39;s like a really cool (113:36 - 113:43)
raid um to do uh but if you need help uh (113:39 - 113:45)
you can jump over to my twitch streams (113:43 - 113:46)
and just say like hey Steve I listen to (113:45 - 113:48)
podcast I need help getting Dragonite (113:46 - 113:50)
I&#39;ll as long as I&#39;m not like doing (113:48 - 113:53)
something terribly important I can I can (113:50 - 113:55)
help you or twitch chat can help you (113:53 - 113:56)
they have to tell you they listen to the (113:55 - 113:59)
podcast is that what yeah yeah yeah yeah (113:56 - 114:02)
that&#39;s the key word (113:59 - 114:02)
that&#39;s the secret word is I listen to (114:03 - 114:09)
the podcast what are the uh what are the (114:05 - 114:11)
drops for Dragonite raid like what are (114:09 - 114:13)
people getting when they defeat (114:11 - 114:16)
Dragonite like still Urban mystica yeah (114:13 - 114:20)
the Lura mystica can happen um same (114:16 - 114:24)
stuff you always get uh otherwise but (114:20 - 114:27)
cool yeah if if it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty it&#39;s (114:24 - 114:30)
pretty straightforward I think uh I (114:27 - 114:33)
think if you have the DLC I think and (114:30 - 114:34)
you&#39;re like I&#39;m not sure what to build I (114:33 - 114:37)
think Arch duraladon or Arch Arch aladon (114:34 - 114:40)
sorry uh is probably (114:37 - 114:43)
the the best you can build for it (114:40 - 114:45)
because it works really good for both (114:43 - 114:48)
team play and if if you just don&#39;t have (114:45 - 114:49)
anyone to play with I think it works (114:48 - 114:51)
really well uh Arch aladon has a cool (114:49 - 114:54)
ability called stamina so every time you (114:51 - 114:57)
get hit your defense goes up and since (114:54 - 115:00)
Dragonite is a physical attacker you (114:57 - 115:02)
just get bulkier and bulkier every time (115:00 - 115:05)
and then Arch can set reflect for the (115:02 - 115:09)
team which also helps you uh it can set (115:05 - 115:12)
it can use uh breaking swipe which helps (115:09 - 115:14)
you but also helps the team it helps you (115:12 - 115:16)
power up your tralization it also lowers (115:14 - 115:19)
Dragon Knight&#39;s attack uh and then you (115:16 - 115:22)
can body press which is super effective (115:19 - 115:29)
damage AR shadon has I think 130 base um (115:22 - 115:31)
defense uh whereas like a Pokemon that (115:29 - 115:33)
I&#39;ve seen people using which I don&#39;t (115:31 - 115:35)
super recommend is like Corvin knite (115:33 - 115:38)
Corvin knite has 105 (115:35 - 115:42)
oh not Hannah not as good Corin knite is (115:38 - 115:47)
fine it&#39;s just a lot slower than Z or ar (115:42 - 115:50)
or chadon usually not the best (115:47 - 115:53)
choice yeah I think I think corvite is (115:50 - 115:56)
better as like a screecher and then like (115:53 - 115:59)
a screecher reflect pretty much like I (115:56 - 116:01)
think Corin knite helps Arch or chadon (115:59 - 116:03)
or zamazenta just do the raid even (116:01 - 116:06)
faster versus like corvite being like I (116:03 - 116:09)
can body press too like yeah you&#39;re (116:06 - 116:11)
you&#39;re trying little buddy you can do it (116:09 - 116:13)
just not as good as the one standing (116:11 - 116:15)
next to (116:13 - 116:18)
you you sure can little little (116:15 - 116:20)
bird just need to go get yourself a (116:18 - 116:23)
staple remover Pokemon that&#39;s that&#39;s all (116:20 - 116:24)
you need for (116:23 - 116:27)
these yeah yeah yeah our child Down&#39;s a (116:24 - 116:29)
really cool Pokemon for this raid (116:27 - 116:32)
um (116:29 - 116:35)
so uh yeah get yourself a get yourself a (116:32 - 116:39)
boosted shiny SLO or Beldum or Bagon or (116:35 - 116:42)
latar um You probably have all those (116:39 - 116:45)
Pokemon if you play Pokemon go uh but (116:42 - 116:49)
maybe you don&#39;t have a Shiny (116:45 - 116:53)
Ponyta or a shiny garan Pony (116:49 - 116:57)
great segue that was a pretty good (116:53 - 117:01)
segue which is September&#39;s Community (116:57 - 117:04)
Day uh this is off pokemongolive.com (117:01 - 117:05)
we&#39;re excited to announce Ponyta the (117:04 - 117:08)
firehorse Pokemon and gallerian Ponyta (117:05 - 117:11)
the unique horn Pokemon will be featured (117:08 - 117:14)
for Community Day uh the featured attack (117:11 - 117:16)

the Stardust for (117:27 - 117:32)
catching uh how do you two feel about (117:29 - 117:35)
double pony (117:32 - 117:35)
day it&#39;s fine (117:36 - 117:43)
I ra raging reviews here no it&#39;s it&#39;s (117:39 - 117:45)
good like I I like Ponyta I like (117:43 - 117:47)
gallerian Ponyta they&#39;re great uh you (117:45 - 117:50)
know when it comes to Community Day I&#39;m (117:47 - 117:52)
still one of the people who&#39;s like I (117:50 - 117:54)
just want I want the shinies more than (117:52 - 117:55)
anything I want to make sure I have you (117:54 - 117:59)
know one of each I have a few garan (117:55 - 118:02)
Ponyta shinies I am missing I only have (117:59 - 118:06)
one Kanto Ponyta shiny so I do need one (118:02 - 118:08)
so I can evolve one to Rapidash uh but (118:06 - 118:12)
otherwise this is cool I I do like the (118:08 - 118:15)
fact that they&#39;re featuring both (118:12 - 118:17)
because back when they featured (118:15 - 118:21)
gallerian Zig zagon for Community Day (118:17 - 118:23)
they did not give a (118:21 - 118:28)
a helenian zig zagon henan henan that&#39;s (118:23 - 118:30)
the right term yep that is correct thank (118:28 - 118:32)
you that is (118:30 - 118:34)
correct we&#39;re just not used to it what (118:32 - 118:36)
would you say Steve what would you say (118:34 - 118:38)
instead no we&#39;re that&#39;s the right one (118:36 - 118:40)
I&#39;ve looked them up I know it is I&#39;m (118:38 - 118:42)
asking Steve though I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know (118:40 - 118:43)
what (118:42 - 118:46)
else sure henan (118:43 - 118:48)
henan all right (118:46 - 118:53)
anyways um so they didn&#39;t do the other (118:48 - 118:56)
Zig zagon they only did Garian Zig zagon (118:53 - 118:58)
during that Community Day and that was a (118:56 - 119:01)
bummer as someone who does not have any (118:58 - 119:04)
shiny henian Zig zagon in yeah I think I (119:01 - 119:06)
only have one so I&#39;m glad that they&#39;re (119:04 - 119:08)
doing both they they have done this (119:06 - 119:10)
though before with like sandrew right (119:08 - 119:11)
didn&#39;t they do a sandrew that was both (119:10 - 119:15)
alolan and cantonian Y so that was early (119:11 - 119:19)
2022 I think yeah and that&#39;s it though (119:15 - 119:20)
right that that&#39;s the only other time (119:19 - 119:24)
they&#39;ve done where they have (119:20 - 119:26)
taken both regionals and made them into (119:24 - 119:29)
one Community Day feel like there was (119:26 - 119:31)
one more I think there was one more and (119:29 - 119:33)
I can&#39;t think of it what it is right now (119:31 - 119:35)
they didn&#39;t do Vulpix yet right oh they (119:33 - 119:39)
did Geodude they did Geodude Canton and (119:35 - 119:42)
Jed yeah they did not do Vulpix yet no (119:39 - 119:46)
but um so yeah I know I&#39;m into it I like (119:42 - 119:49)
horses yes exactly I think I&#39;m in a (119:46 - 119:52)
similar spot I I have well I do have the (119:49 - 119:53)
full (119:52 - 119:56)
cantonian uh Ponyta shiny set already I (119:53 - 120:00)
don&#39;t have any Gan shinies there it&#39;s a (119:56 - 120:02)
semi exciting I mean the bonus isn&#39;t (120:00 - 120:05)
super huge for me um the one thing that (120:02 - 120:07)
bugged me was they didn&#39;t animate the (120:05 - 120:10)
Ponyta right in the trailer but that&#39;s (120:07 - 120:12)
fine horses are hard to animate I think (120:10 - 120:15)
they&#39;re consistent at messing up any (120:12 - 120:17)
animation around Ponyta that no you (120:15 - 120:19)
don&#39;t have to wouldn&#39;t surprise me (120:17 - 120:22)
they&#39;re consistent at messing up just (120:19 - 120:23)
right there remember when they just (120:22 - 120:27)
forgot to put in its entire tail (120:23 - 120:30)
yep and that&#39;s not even that&#39;s not even (120:27 - 120:32)
part of horses are hard to animate (120:30 - 120:35)
that&#39;s just that&#39;s just sorry that&#39;s (120:32 - 120:37)
just Pony to when you talk about (120:35 - 120:41)
animating it just brings me back to (120:37 - 120:44)
sword and shield when zenta or zian (120:41 - 120:47)
turns around oh they just like hard turn (120:44 - 120:49)
he just turned them around like they&#39;re (120:47 - 120:52)
on a lazy Susan thing never gonna forget (120:49 - 120:53)
that (120:52 - 120:55)
they really tried to improve on that in (120:53 - 120:56)
scarlet and violet and then some of the (120:55 - 120:59)
scenes are just choppy yeah yeah just (120:56 - 121:01)
you just hard cut that you don&#39;t need (120:59 - 121:04)
you don&#39;t need to show the Lazy Susan (121:01 - 121:07)
it&#39;s okay it&#39;s it&#39;s a memorable (121:04 - 121:10)
memorable time now now now that we&#39;ve (121:07 - 121:12)
gotten Like official confirmation that (121:10 - 121:16)
Galler is is coming uh with the the (121:12 - 121:19)
world&#39;s trailer I also very confused how (121:16 - 121:22)
people are still like what is this (121:19 - 121:25)
trailer implying like isihara literally (121:22 - 121:27)
says that something gigantic is coming (121:25 - 121:29)
what do you (121:27 - 121:31)
mean who saying that who doesn&#39;t know (121:29 - 121:34)
that that was a Dynamax gigantamax (121:31 - 121:37)
trailer I (121:34 - 121:40)
don&#39;t I don&#39;t know how like more painted (121:37 - 121:43)
this has to be for people to be like (121:40 - 121:46)
this defin got the red clouds you&#39;ve got (121:43 - 121:49)
saying gigantic they had the gigantamax (121:46 - 121:52)
Pokemon no Dynamax Pokemon in the (121:49 - 121:55)
yearly anniversary image this year yeah (121:52 - 121:57)
so clearly it&#39;s Z (121:55 - 122:00)
moves yeah yeah yeah obviously gigantic (121:57 - 122:04)
Z moves are coming (122:00 - 122:04)
finally so now that now that like we (122:05 - 122:09)
know Galler is (122:07 - 122:13)
coming and this is a really also Garian (122:09 - 122:16)
Ponyta being featured here um I wonder (122:13 - 122:19)
if they&#39;re going to do like more of this (122:16 - 122:21)
one Niantic loves their gen one there&#39;s (122:19 - 122:23)
still plenty of gen Pokemon they can do (122:21 - 122:24)
eight years into this game we&#39;re still (122:23 - 122:27)
getting gen one Community Days which is (122:24 - 122:30)
crazy but yeah I could I could see and I (122:27 - 122:32)
think it would be a really fun Community (122:30 - 122:35)
Day in my mind maybe not I could see (122:32 - 122:37)
them doing a Meowth Community day which (122:35 - 122:40)
is Meowth gerian Meowth and a lan Meowth (122:37 - 122:43)
that would be fun 100% I would love that (122:40 - 122:45)
cats yeah I think that would be a super (122:43 - 122:49)
super fun Community Day and that again (122:45 - 122:52)
scratches n niantic&#39;s itch of gen one f (122:49 - 122:56)
Community days but yeah if they were to (122:52 - 122:59)
do like a classic Community Day of Zig (122:56 - 123:02)
zigon it would (122:59 - 123:04)
be I don&#39;t think that would be exciting (123:02 - 123:05)
unless they brought (123:04 - 123:09)
in henan (123:05 - 123:09)
Zig agreed yeah I agree with that well (123:10 - 123:18)
yeah I think well I guess they don&#39;t (123:15 - 123:20)
they&#39;re not it&#39;s not like gallerian (123:18 - 123:22)
Ponyta has a gigantamax or anything (123:20 - 123:24)
thing so it&#39;s not even related to that (123:22 - 123:26)
they&#39;re just bringing in gallerian (123:24 - 123:29)
gallerian Pokemon for this time frame I (123:26 - 123:31)
guess but I I imagine they would do like (123:29 - 123:35)
classic ones with like Gastly like we (123:31 - 123:36)
were saying before the ones that like (123:35 - 123:38)
could have a (123:36 - 123:40)
gigantamax at some point so you get like (123:38 - 123:42)
Gastly or Charmander and there are (123:40 - 123:44)
plenty of Kanto Pokemon that have that (123:42 - 123:46)
they already yeah they already revealed (123:44 - 123:48)
Charizard I mean they have Charizard in (123:46 - 123:50)
like the teasers for the (123:48 - 123:55)
gigx CLS yep um which makes me wonder if (123:50 - 123:56)
first one they&#39;re going to do or if (123:55 - 123:58)
they&#39;re just going to release multiple (123:56 - 124:02)
at one time or something but yeah I (123:58 - 124:05)
don&#39;t know how the the Dynamax (124:02 - 124:09)
gigantamax is going to work (124:05 - 124:09)
I don&#39;t like any Pokemon can Dynamax MH (124:09 - 124:17)
so there would have to be some sort of (124:14 - 124:21)
like currency or energy like Mega Energy (124:17 - 124:23)
Dynamax energy I guess well I mean there (124:21 - 124:25)
is Dynamax energy there is Dynamax (124:23 - 124:26)
energy and sword and shield that you (124:25 - 124:28)
collect and then you can give it to any (124:26 - 124:31)
Pokemon mhm and then you could be one of (124:28 - 124:33)
those competitive people who forgot to (124:31 - 124:35)
Dynam forgot to give their Pokemon (124:33 - 124:37)
Dynamax energy and then mid battle (124:35 - 124:38)
they&#39;re like this is the Pokemon I need (124:37 - 124:41)
a Dynamax and then realize like oh I it (124:38 - 124:43)
doesn&#39;t have as much HP as it does (124:41 - 124:45)
because I didn&#39;t Power It Up not that I (124:43 - 124:48)
didn&#39;t do that a bunch of (124:45 - 124:51)
times so I I would assume there would be (124:48 - 124:54)
like some sort of thing that you collect (124:51 - 124:58)
to then make any of your current Pokemon (124:54 - 124:59)
Dynamax but then I would assume that (124:58 - 125:02)
like gigantamax would be just hidden (124:59 - 125:06)
behind a raid pay wall like Mega (125:02 - 125:09)
Pokemon oh do you think it&#39;ll be I think (125:06 - 125:10)
we talked a little bit about this before (125:09 - 125:12)
but do you think it&#39;ll be only certain (125:10 - 125:14)
so like you can have a Gengar that can (125:12 - 125:17)
Dynamax but then like you could have a (125:14 - 125:19)
different Gengar that can gigantamax yes (125:17 - 125:21)
100% I think they&#39;re going to do that (125:19 - 125:23)
have to have a that specific Gengar it (125:21 - 125:24)
won&#39;t be any that&#39;s how they did it in (125:23 - 125:26)
sword and shield too remember that weed (125:24 - 125:27)
about that&#39;s how it was in the main (125:26 - 125:28)
series oh yeah no I know that&#39;s why it (125:27 - 125:30)
was in the main series until until they (125:28 - 125:33)
gave the like gigantamax or whatever it (125:30 - 125:37)
was so in five years Niantic will (125:33 - 125:40)
introduce Max (125:37 - 125:40)
soup yeah and it&#39;ll cost 10 (125:40 - 125:44)
bucks yeah I think uh I think for sure (125:46 - 125:52)
it will probably be like like literally (125:49 - 125:55)
just like megas like what they we were (125:52 - 125:58)
on like what maybe one Mega every month (125:55 - 126:00)
if we were lucky yeah but you can Mega (125:58 - 126:02)
but so the one thing that would be a bit (126:00 - 126:05)
of a bummer is you know let&#39;s go back to (126:02 - 126:09)
to Gengar you know I have Shiny Gengar I (126:05 - 126:10)
have a few different Shiny Gengar and (126:09 - 126:12)
it&#39;s like oh well none of these Shiny (126:10 - 126:14)
Gengar will be able to gigantamax I have (126:12 - 126:17)
to go get another Shiny Gengar that can (126:14 - 126:19)
gigantamax versus like the (126:17 - 126:21)
megas that can you know Mega Evolve any (126:19 - 126:23)
of the ones I already have I don&#39;t have (126:21 - 126:27)
to like go catch a new uh Rayquaza or a (126:23 - 126:31)
new Lucario to Mega Evolve it uh so that (126:27 - 126:32)
would you know be a little bit of a (126:31 - 126:36)
bummer but but they don&#39;t have Max soup (126:32 - 126:38)
so so it has to work that (126:36 - 126:42)
way I mean I I think I think it will (126:38 - 126:44)
work that way and I think people will be (126:42 - 126:46)
upset Bobby I think somebody will be (126:44 - 126:52)
like I want to gigantamax my 100% IV (126:46 - 126:54)
lucky Gengar and I can&#39;t because I have (126:52 - 126:57)
to catch a new one that that that&#39;s not (126:54 - 126:59)
exclusive to Niantic that was literally (126:57 - 127:01)
what they did in sword and shield yeah (126:59 - 127:04)
it is no I know I mean I I understand (127:01 - 127:06)
that and so it it does make sense I I (127:04 - 127:08)
can see them doing that but you know you (127:06 - 127:11)
could also move forward like because it (127:08 - 127:12)
happened in sword and shield five years (127:11 - 127:14)
ago Niantic you could just get to the (127:12 - 127:17)
part where we have Max soup now I could (127:14 - 127:19)
definitely see people getting frustrated (127:17 - 127:21)
specifically with Gengar for that (127:19 - 127:23)
because G AR is definitely a fan (127:21 - 127:27)
favorite yeah but if they want you to do (127:23 - 127:29)
raids yeah which they said that these (127:27 - 127:30)
Pokemon will be in raids and we don&#39;t (127:29 - 127:34)
even know how those raids even (127:30 - 127:34)
work (127:34 - 127:40)
um then yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see it (127:36 - 127:43)
where you you would I my guess would be (127:40 - 127:46)
you would be able to the Dynamax your (127:43 - 127:48)
shiny 100% Gengar but if you want to (127:46 - 127:50)
gigant to Max it you&#39;re going to have to (127:48 - 127:52)
get a new one and you know Gengar is the (127:50 - 127:55)
perfect example because gigantamax Shiny (127:52 - 127:59)
Gengar is phenomenal (127:55 - 128:04)
yeah and shiny Dynamax (127:59 - 128:07)
Gengar is not even (128:04 - 128:09)
noticeable (128:07 - 128:15)
yep yeah so I&#39;m I&#39;m more Curious of like (128:09 - 128:17)
when the starters (128:15 - 128:20)
come like what other Pokemon are going (128:17 - 128:22)
to come with it or like are they going (128:20 - 128:23)
to do a lot of Galler Pokemon or are (128:22 - 128:25)
they going to drip feed Galler like they (128:23 - 128:26)
drip (128:25 - 128:29)
feeded every other Pokemon recently (128:26 - 128:31)
where it was like the last three years (128:29 - 128:34)
forward yeah like oh cool we got (128:31 - 128:39)
draa in raids okay oh we got turtonator (128:34 - 128:40)
in (128:39 - 128:43)
raids (128:40 - 128:46)
okay (128:43 - 128:49)
yeah I don&#39;t know I like they will drip (128:46 - 128:51)
they will drip feed them they have to I (128:49 - 128:52)
mean that just this just how it is now (128:51 - 128:55)
like I&#39;d be shocked if they were just (128:52 - 128:57)
like here&#39;s half of Galler all at once (128:55 - 129:00)
be so much fun though it would be and I (128:57 - 129:03)
it wouldn&#39;t really take away from (129:00 - 129:04)
anything because we&#39;ve talked about this (129:03 - 129:06)
before but like drip feeding these (129:04 - 129:09)
Pokemon at this point in time like just (129:06 - 129:10)
find a different some find a different (129:09 - 129:14)
way to get people like draa coming into (129:10 - 129:15)
the game was not bringing back a bunch (129:14 - 129:17)
of players right like to your point (129:15 - 129:20)
Tator becoming a raid Pokemon was not (129:17 - 129:22)
bringing back the people who were (129:20 - 129:26)
chasing down Snorlax in 2016 like so (129:22 - 129:28)
what is the difference at this point (129:26 - 129:31)
like other things in the game are either (129:28 - 129:32)
can bring people back or are not (129:31 - 129:35)
bringing people back but releasing one (129:32 - 129:38)
Pokemon every six weeks isn&#39;t doing it I (129:35 - 129:40)
100% agree with you (129:38 - 129:43)
that putting turnator in the game isn&#39;t (129:40 - 129:46)
bringing anyone back I totally agree (129:43 - 129:47)
with you there&#39;s one person listening (129:46 - 129:49)
being like Tator was my favorite and I (129:47 - 129:51)
installed Pokémon go for the first time (129:49 - 129:54)
to get Tator yeah that one person does (129:51 - 129:55)
exist I&#39;m confident of that that one (129:54 - 129:57)
person is not playing Pokémon go anymore (129:55 - 129:58)
because they caught that Tator (129:57 - 129:59)
transferred it to home and we&#39;re like (129:58 - 130:01)
there&#39;s my go there&#39;s my Tator from go (129:59 - 130:05)
I&#39;m done but I do think the drip (130:01 - 130:09)
feed is literally only for whales I (130:05 - 130:10)
think it (130:09 - 130:14)
is if you if you put too many Pokemon in (130:10 - 130:17)
those whales cannot spend enough money (130:14 - 130:19)
fast enough whereas like if you just put (130:17 - 130:21)
turnator in raids those whales are going (130:19 - 130:23)
to do as as many tators as they can to (130:21 - 130:25)
get the shiny which is like what one in (130:23 - 130:28)
60 um and then by the time they do get (130:25 - 130:30)
the shiny or they&#39;re all raed out for (130:28 - 130:32)
turnator you now have draa you now have (130:30 - 130:35)
dran you now have a mega Pokemon but you (130:32 - 130:37)
don&#39;t have to put the shiny in when you (130:35 - 130:38)
put the Pokemon in you could put half of (130:37 - 130:40)
Galler in and then you can drip feed the (130:38 - 130:43)
shinies later but like put the new (130:40 - 130:46)
Pokemon in the game and then you don&#39;t (130:43 - 130:48)
have to put in the shinies (130:46 - 130:50)
now you&#39;re still going to get those (130:48 - 130:52)
whales that want the shin that want the (130:50 - 130:55)
one in 60 chance put in put in terator (130:52 - 130:59)
not terator put in um put in you know uh (130:55 - 131:01)
I can&#39;t think of what a what a one stage (130:59 - 131:03)
Pokemon put in crar right put in Karat (131:01 - 131:05)
and Steve will do a million of them (131:03 - 131:08)
anyway but put in Karat and don&#39;t do (131:05 - 131:09)
this actually n don&#39;t put it in just in (131:08 - 131:13)
raids but put CR like in now and then (131:09 - 131:16)
people will catch it be done but then (131:13 - 131:18)
shiny crar an comes around 6 months from (131:16 - 131:21)
now they already do this yes that&#39;s what (131:18 - 131:22)
I&#39;m but that&#39;s what (131:21 - 131:25)
you could putar in with 50 other Pokemon (131:22 - 131:28)
and then 6 months from now crar can be (131:25 - 131:31)
shiny and in you know raids or whatever (131:28 - 131:33)
and those people those same people will (131:31 - 131:34)
come back and raid it 60 times to get (131:33 - 131:36)
the shiny one they&#39;re going to get that (131:34 - 131:37)
later yeah they&#39;re still going to be (131:36 - 131:40)
able to do that they just could also do (131:37 - 131:42)
that while still releasing a nice big (131:40 - 131:44)
batch of Galler Pokemon that would let (131:42 - 131:46)
people have a ton of fun and come back (131:44 - 131:49)
to the game for probably up to a month I (131:46 - 131:51)
think you get more people coming back to (131:49 - 131:54)
the game when you release 25 new Pokemon (131:51 - 131:58)
at one time and drip feeding 25 over 25 (131:54 - 131:59)
weeks you&#39;re not going to get people (131:58 - 132:01)
coming back in that way but you&#39;ll get (131:59 - 132:04)
people coming back to catch 25 30 new (132:01 - 132:07)
Pokemon at one time that they can that (132:04 - 132:08)
they can catch Y and again you don&#39;t (132:07 - 132:10)
need to release the shinies they they&#39; (132:08 - 132:13)
did this in in hoen like they released (132:10 - 132:15)
it in three batches and there was one (132:13 - 132:17)
shiny each time they released a batch (132:15 - 132:19)
right so it was like there was one batch (132:17 - 132:22)
had swabl was the shiny that was (132:19 - 132:24)
immediate uh Aeron was the shiny that (132:22 - 132:25)
was immediate in one batch and then I (132:24 - 132:27)
think one batch like it was when alolan (132:25 - 132:30)
Raichu and Mal while were in raids or ma (132:27 - 132:32)
not L Raichu but Mal while was in raids (132:30 - 132:33)
and that was the shiny Pokemon at that (132:32 - 132:38)
time so you know they released 40 (132:33 - 132:40)
Pokemon and only one was immediately (132:38 - 132:42)
shiny and then over time they released (132:40 - 132:45)
the other shinies and those whales are (132:42 - 132:47)
going to come back and be raiding those (132:45 - 132:48)
for those shinies you know they&#39;re going (132:47 - 132:49)
to be going for those shinies at that (132:48 - 132:53)
point in time but I don&#39;t know I think (132:49 - 132:54)
I think you could (132:53 - 132:58)
release a batch of Pokemon (132:54 - 133:01)
and it&#39;d be okay what it&#39;s sounding like (132:58 - 133:03)
to me is do they want people to have (133:01 - 133:06)
more fun or do they want to to appease (133:03 - 133:08)
the whales (133:06 - 133:10)
more I mean the whales keep the game (133:08 - 133:13)
free (133:10 - 133:13)
yeah yeah I&#39;m playing it either way so I (133:14 - 133:19)
guess I can&#39;t complain but I I a million (133:17 - 133:21)
per agree with you Bobby I think Niantic (133:19 - 133:23)
made the biggest mistake I shouldn&#39;t put (133:21 - 133:25)
it all in Niantic cuz they have to go (133:23 - 133:27)
through the Pokemon company the Pokemon (133:25 - 133:29)
company has to prove everything um but I (133:27 - 133:31)
think I think the Pokemon company and (133:29 - 133:33)
Niantic made a huge mistake with Gen (133:31 - 133:36)
five like I legitimately thought when (133:33 - 133:38)
Gen five came out they should have (133:36 - 133:40)
pulled every Pokemon and they should (133:38 - 133:43)
have treated gen five like gen (133:40 - 133:45)
one and they should have like kind of (133:43 - 133:47)
like soft rebooted the game at that (133:45 - 133:50)
point even if it was for like two weeks (133:47 - 133:53)
of like only Gen 5 Pokemon are in the (133:50 - 133:54)
game it&#39;s going to be the same thing (133:53 - 133:56)
instead of everyone running across (133:54 - 133:57)
Central Park for a Snorlax they&#39;re (133:56 - 134:00)
running across Central Park (133:57 - 134:00)
for a jig again I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know (134:00 - 134:06)
what no one&#39;s running across Central (134:04 - 134:09)
Park for a Dre (134:06 - 134:09)
against I don&#39;t know what the Snorlax (134:11 - 134:15)
equivalent in gen five is (134:13 - 134:18)
sylveon that&#39;s gen six that&#39;s gen six (134:15 - 134:21)
isn&#39;t it (134:18 - 134:27)
Larvesta vona vona vona maybe all right (134:21 - 134:30)
um but I thought that would have been so (134:27 - 134:31)
cool that&#39;s like really the only (134:30 - 134:34)
generation that could have done it yeah (134:31 - 134:36)
as as as well um and I guess like they (134:34 - 134:38)
could even still do that to this point (134:36 - 134:42)
right like when when uh Unova Fest gets (134:38 - 134:45)
announced or eventually comes whether (134:42 - 134:46)
who knows how that&#39;s going to work (134:45 - 134:49)
because like if they announce Unova Fest (134:46 - 134:52)
in February because I think all of them (134:49 - 134:55)
have been around February MH and by Fest (134:52 - 134:59)
you mean tour yes Unova tour yova bus (134:55 - 135:01)
the Unova bus the Unova trainer bus is (134:59 - 135:05)
coming jump on if they announce Unova (135:01 - 135:07)
tour in February and it&#39;s not in New (135:05 - 135:09)
York which why would it be in New York (135:07 - 135:11)
New York is freezing in February that (135:09 - 135:14)
all seems just very (135:11 - 135:18)
weird like time and location (135:14 - 135:21)
wise but also if they did announce a NOA (135:18 - 135:24)
to her again I think a good way to be (135:21 - 135:26)
like we&#39;re pulling everything from the (135:24 - 135:29)
game and for the next two weeks just all (135:26 - 135:32)
Unova Pokemon everywhere we&#39;re opening (135:29 - 135:34)
the floodgates you&#39;ll be able to see (135:32 - 135:36)
your main Fus and your dragans and your (135:34 - 135:38)
feel like it might be a little late for (135:36 - 135:42)
that people already have these (135:38 - 135:45)
Pokemon yeah I mean people already have (135:42 - 135:48)
Pony to Gan Ponyta but but like could (135:45 - 135:50)
you imagine just opening your game and (135:48 - 135:52)
just seeing nothing but basculin how (135:50 - 135:54)
wonderful how wonderful would that sound (135:52 - 135:57)
awesome that sounds that sounds like the (135:54 - 136:01)
perfect game what do you mean basculin (135:57 - 136:05)
go basculin everywhere (136:01 - 136:08)
um uh yeah I I would love to see a bunch (136:05 - 136:10)
of Galler Pokemon I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s (136:08 - 136:13)
happening I am curious though like we (136:10 - 136:16)
don&#39;t know the numbers I am curious if (136:13 - 136:21)
groi score Bunny and sabul (136:16 - 136:24)
those are the Galler Pokemon right uh (136:21 - 136:28)
they if if those alone would bring (136:24 - 136:33)
people back like I know we as fans want (136:28 - 136:35)
to see like 50 60 (136:33 - 136:37)
Pokemon but if they&#39;re just like (136:35 - 136:40)
Galler&#39;s here AKA here are the starters (136:37 - 136:43)
and here&#39;s like wulu and squit because I (136:40 - 136:44)
think that&#39;s like exactly what they did (136:43 - 136:47)
with like Gen 6 here is your two Route (136:44 - 136:49)
One Pokemon and here are your starters (136:47 - 136:50)
they did that with six and I think they (136:49 - 136:52)
did that with seven they did that with (136:50 - 136:53)
eight already without the starters they (136:52 - 136:57)
didet and wulu yeah yeah Pokemon that&#39;s (136:53 - 136:59)
what I&#39;m saying here&#39;s your starters and (136:57 - 137:01)
here&#39;s your sovet and your (136:59 - 137:05)
wulu i h I do think that brings people (137:01 - 137:06)
back not because of the wulu and the (137:05 - 137:09)
sovet but because people like starter (137:06 - 137:11)
Pokemon and starter (137:09 - 137:14)
Pokemon have a lot of weight to (137:11 - 137:16)
them but that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t want (137:14 - 137:18)
to see like 50 (137:16 - 137:22)
Pokemon yeah I did I liked how they did (137:18 - 137:26)
Pala with the with the starters and was (137:22 - 137:28)
it the starters and L chunk and then (137:26 - 137:32)
they made L chunk shiny right away um I (137:28 - 137:33)
thought that was pretty good I could see (137:32 - 137:36)
them doing that again with you know with (137:33 - 137:38)
Galler and the starters and then maybe (137:36 - 137:41)
make Wu shiny or uh still think they (137:38 - 137:43)
should introduce rooky in some way with (137:41 - 137:45)
I think Rook is going to be a community (137:43 - 137:48)
day yeah probably makes me sad because I (137:45 - 137:52)
love that line but yeah yeah yeah (137:48 - 137:55)
I don&#39;t know I you know I I don&#39;t see (137:52 - 137:57)
them releasing a bunch at once I I I do (137:55 - 137:59)
think they&#39;ll drip feed in some way I do (137:57 - 138:02)
think they&#39;ll bring in the starters uh (137:59 - 138:04)
with to your point like a couple Route (138:02 - 138:06)
One Pokemon even though again we already (138:04 - 138:08)
have svet and wulu in the game but I I (138:06 - 138:10)
think they bring them back and maybe (138:08 - 138:14)
make them shiny make scet and wulu shiny (138:10 - 138:16)
we do have them in the game right but (138:14 - 138:18)
they&#39;re not like in the game in the game (138:16 - 138:20)
like you can&#39;t catch a squet or a wulu (138:18 - 138:22)
right now currently no I don&#39;t think you (138:20 - 138:25)
can I know sevit is like one of the (138:22 - 138:27)
Pokemon that a lot of people want to (138:25 - 138:29)
trade for because it they do come back (138:27 - 138:31)
from time to time but (138:29 - 138:35)
rarely um so yeah scet was one of those (138:31 - 138:38)
weird ones that&#39;s like this is sort of a (138:35 - 138:41)
rare Pokemon if you have it for trading (138:38 - 138:45)
purposes Ino but I think currently you (138:41 - 138:48)
can&#39;t catch a sovet or a wulu in the (138:45 - 138:51)
wild yeah and double I think is very (138:48 - 138:53)
decent NG (138:51 - 138:57)
GBL yeah I know I kept a few of each for (138:53 - 138:58)
that purpose because it was like oh (138:57 - 139:00)
these actually aren&#39;t really spawning (138:58 - 139:03)
anymore well there are definitely points (139:00 - 139:04)
this year where you have been able to (139:03 - 139:07)
get wulu yes and for sure it was like (139:04 - 139:10)
during an event or something when you (139:07 - 139:13)
could but yeah I think they will I think (139:10 - 139:16)
they could definitely bring the starters (139:13 - 139:20)
in and then the route one Pokemon um and (139:16 - 139:22)
make make them shiny or something would (139:20 - 139:24)
be could could be a way that they would (139:22 - 139:28)
maybe kick off bringing Galler back (139:24 - 139:31)
or mixed in with Dynamax in some way as (139:28 - 139:32)
well but I you know I do think we&#39;re (139:31 - 139:33)
going to see those (139:32 - 139:36)
starters sooner than later at this point (139:33 - 139:38)
hope who&#39;s going to be the rare one Sor (139:36 - 139:41)
bunny oh it has to be Sor bunny that&#39;s (139:38 - 139:45)
the popular one yeah (139:41 - 139:48)
yeah yep definitely all right we went (139:45 - 139:52)
