[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 451st episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj i was a little a little wary on the little number we were at abbey was a big number last time i know it's like a reset yeah four five one here to talk about pokemon is greg hello i'm here i am back in my slowly being renovated uh study i have study well i can't call it office because i can't see i don't work in here well i don't do work work in here i work on other things in here but uh a year of collecting things through delivery has made my house untenable and things need to change i need new areas to put the things that i purchased because i've had money that i wasn't using unsp on traveling just get a new house no i have a big enough house as it is plus i would have to then take everything out of this house and put it in the new house without a whole other set of problems i'll be doing that in a couple of months will here in honor of episode 451 uh we will be doing a retrospective and analysis of the entire bibliography of rape bradbury right correct yes who okay i'm not going to ask whoa okay bradberry dude ray sounds like a baseball player yes that is no he's an author i remember back in high school we set the oven to 451 degrees and shoved a book in there to see what would happen did it burst into flame it did not but it did turn black it did crest over but we were expecting like a giant burst of fire and we were very disappointed when we did not get a giant burst of fire instead we just got slowly curling pages until it turned into ash yeah uh there's uh that whole triangle of needing like fuel oxygen and the whatever energy source to create fire that you were missing part of that so we were missing part of that we had we had a lot of direct heat but not actual flame uh just to inform uh mr surumi uh ray bradbury is the author of the fahrenheit 451 which is a seminal book about uh well what is it censorship is a good way to put it which is hilarious because it was when it first came out uh people tried to ban it so when i refer to the show as double plus good you should look at me yeah but that's not ray bradbury that's uh orson uh no i thought perfectly what was double plus good double plus good is wow now we're just gone down a dystopian rabbit hole of dystopia ray brady pepper a science fiction author but like more of like a literary science fiction author i think he also did the martian chronicles i'm pretty sure yeah yeah yeah uh but yeah you know oh definitely as good as 1984. yeah that's right you know there's a lot of dystopian novels yes many of them did not actually pan out the way people predicted speaking of dystopia pokemon cards still sold out i actually recently discovered that one yes that was confirmed for me that yes pokemon cards are still sold out but also uh baseball cards and no actually i'm sorry it's not baseball cards it's like football and basketball cards which who even knew that was a thing yeah are sold out most targets well i guess your mileage may vary but they usually have a limit of three cards in general whether it's magic yu-gi-oh baseball football golf i don't think golf carts are a thing maybe they are i don't think oh which is amazing that that magic and yu-gi-oh cards are still available because what does that say yeah i'm not sure why i i guess i don't know i don't know magic or yugo enough to know why they haven't been hit by the scalper crazy i mean magic's a hot mess right like even even if you're gonna try to figure out what pack has the good thing in it people aren't gonna be like oh you you picked up demonic tudor i love that character but actually oh it's a chromatic lantern i love them in the anime but actually the main thing is with magic that the packs that have the stuff that would be of value like collecting valuable uh those packs are about like a hundred dollars per pack yeah already yeah so you can't just go in and buy a whole bunch and think i'm gonna strike it rich for four dollars a pack well magic needs to work with the pokemon company to get charizard over there and then they're probably they're give it to 2022 because they are combining universes much to the consternation of many in the magic community this is very true but according to the target website there are some trading card pokemon trading card bundles at my local target that target website's never right i can get the small but mighty premium collection it is in stock right now however it is not eligible for me to pick it up yeah i actually have to go into the store and maybe which means by the time you get there it's gone i also can get the champions path collection double v which is apparently in stock but also not eligible no one wants mcchampion's path let's do the pokemon news the little sound goes here i wait i've got some pokemon tcg news uh okay all right professor willow will be printed as a pokemon card this summer hi did you steal my news it is a crossover between pokemon go and the pokemon what did they say it's like uh a collaboration but no no no but they made it sound like that this like was a very in-depth deep negotiation for pokemon go and pokemon collaboration has been finalized between the pokemon go and the pokemon trading card game as if they're not the same company oh that was hilarious for for pokemon news to finally start where pokemon go news just finally start working again on my app and for that to be the first news item that comes through okay hold on let's put a pin in the professor willow we'll come back to that because we got a that'll translate you're gonna ruin the value if you put a pin in it that's really true uh we we had an itunes review the other day that said that they liked the show but we didn't talk about the tcg and the anime enough did we not spend like three whole podcasts spending 40 some minutes talking about the tcg problem i don't know i zoned out at those parts the problem there is probably that we don't go like in depth of like what are the good cards versus what is the chaff yeah which is never going to be so you are running that's not never been our our wheelhouse yeah we also don't do that for like hey what do you what team are you bringing in the pikachu raids this weekend like we should we could we could um but there there's just better resources for i mean we all know you're bringing uh gaster down with your storm drain and then being all surprised when nobody's water moves work and blaming it on chat for ruining it that was their their problem not mine this is why people earthquake in your raids no i haven't been earthquaked in a while also even if we were to talk about what tcg decks are good the only adp that's it that's like there's no other deck you just run adp with zashian and then sometimes you run rusted shield sometimes you don't sometimes you run the air balloon i don't know there there's your tcp minute i told you all the decks that possibly exist in the tcg right now until august is there a good website to go find current meta decks if i wanted to build one from scratch gosh it used to be six prizes back in the day yeah six prizes closed down though well yeah dude um what is the one there's a subreddit that's pretty good um we're never gonna get ready nugget bridge is vgc oh they shut down a long time ago really yeah they're done nugget bridge is gone where do all the evil people congregate now [Music] we covered this it's written um well it's it's been pretty easy to get teams in general for sword and shield just honestly off twitter people will share their teams uh or um right there are there are good reddits of sharing teams or sharing decks but i mean the ptcgo you can just copy and paste the deck list and you're good to go and sort of shield you can just copy and paste the whatever that code is called and you're good to go i don't know maybe we'll circle back uh i'm not sure which which websites are good although like if anyone's thinking about getting into competitive trading card pcg like now now is not the time uh no no like tournaments going on adp is it's a joke but it's actually like the most dominant deck and nothing can really compete with it um but adp would be rotating oh sorry for the non-tcg players you're probably like what the heck is adp it's arceus dialga palkia they put all three of them on one card they need to get rid of them before the gen 4 remakes and then they can reissue it as part of the gen x into the z zone so they've been floating around in space yes uh and then they'll be broken out later you know you joke but the tcg used to have weird stuff like that i remember there was a place like the poke gym or something that i used to look up decks back back back in the day to see if there was rosalia anything that i wanted to use and then i said you know what i don't want to do this roselia has never been a good card i'm sorry rosa always playing a good card yeah they always give the good stuff the vibe yeah this is why i don't play this dumb game um yeah we'll have to circle back on what resources are good there's there there are like um tcg podcasts out the pokemon tcg podcast there are pokemon competitive podcasts out there uh like the pokesports podcast which i was on before like they're really great if you want something competitive in sword and shield um anyways uh this is off pokemon.com the tcg shining fates still exists somewhere in scalpers hands premium collection shiny crobat v-max and shiny dragopalt v-max are now available they launched marth march 5th uh they went up on pokemon center they sold out i'm not joking in about 45 seconds um each will have a promo card one obviously the shiny crowbar will have the shiny crowbar the the other one will have shiny dragopalt uh they will have the bigger promo cards that you can collect and then they have uh coins and then each come with seven booster packs so and seven shining fates booster packs and shining fates has a pretty good hit rate um so what that means is like you're more likely to pull the fancy full art cards than not but it is a smaller set the thing that people want is charizard i think eternitis is like a 30 card which is pretty okay but is it like a card like a good card to use in your deck or alternatives is good if adp didn't exist uh yeah uh charizard's not good it's just charizard it's just like how much longer are we going to be under the yoke of adp do they finally get okay august and then adp will be unless for whatever reason they do some weird rules they reprint it change they could reprint it yeah so shining fates premium collection is apparently out there good luck finding it um speaking of more tcg stuff uh they showed some more cards for battle styles obviously this set is already available in japan so you could have probably looked it up but they showed off on pokemon.com tapu coco uh urshifu there's the single striker shifu v there's the rapid strike urshifu v there's the tapu coco v there's the tapu coco v max there's a flapple v max in the set uh what i'm in which is that's really great [Laughter] love me some flapple uh the the probably the chase card in the set chase card being meaning the most sought-after card would be the secret art hershey foo it's really hard to explain it's a good-looking card though uh but overall battle styles is going to launch march 19th so in about two weeks and it will have 160 cards which is not the biggest set in the world but i still do think this is going to be more of a not a collector set but more of a set for people who want to play competitively a competitive set someone say yes although it's uh nothing's good adp's still going to be good but it's setting the foundation for a new sort of new new mechanic yes which is battle styles do you know what that mechanic does yet what no you just pick which battle style and then the cards that you use in your deck support that battle style yeah so like you you if you do single strike battle style then you build your deck with single strike cards and do they have like a new synergy together or is it just that so for example it'll the so some cards won't be single striker rapid strike they'll just be your normal cards right like adp doesn't say single striker rapid strike in the corner but if you have like a single strike or shifu and then maybe you have a single strike uh esper and then i i don't think that's for a single strike i'm just aiming but then you had a single strike machamp the machampa might have an ability that says any single strike card in play will get 20. okay plus damage boost so adp wouldn't get that because it doesn't say single strike but any card that does would get that boost yeah so i would encourage you to build decks around the single strike slash rapid strike mechanic but since this is the first set none of that will really be good until three months later when a more single strike rapid strike will be introduced yeah but the thing is like also that they may introduce core cards for this mechanic that may not get reprinted in the future so it's kind of like buy in now so that you have those cards that are going to be important in a year from now i think that this will be the first thing that you will be able to walk into target and buy off the shelf maybe not right away how many charizard are in the set zero charizards zero people how many pikachus europeans how many rows rates are in the set i don't think any one but if you want to know how many hershey's are in this set probably like six if you like hershey food i i mean i haven't looked at the the card list so this is completely off the top of my head but my suspicion is that it's probably weighted heavily towards fighting types oh yeah we're looking at a website that is showing japanese versions and viper and zangoose are shown and they are not those two pokemon like to fight each other that's what i've heard so okay here's a quiz which one is single strikes and which one is rapid strikes do you i would have i know the answer assume that the viper's rapid and the xangoose is single oh wait wait wait wait snakes can go yeah yes i i agree with this you're wrong well it's a viper is the single strike it just and then only once only once it's gone it's one and done one and then goose has to scratch a whole bunch apparently i guess that makes sense it was it was 50 50. it was and you got it wrong uh also pokemon.com the pokemon tcg top deck academy episode 5 is available i feel like the last time we talked about this was episode one so they are continuing to put out episodes on their youtube so if you are trying to learn how to play the pokemon trading card game top deck academy is probably what you want to watch i guess how many did we say they were doing 10 i think we guessed are we halfway yeah cause what is five cover uh it covers five covers energy cards tool cards recovery search cards gives you a deck here gives you a cottony uh greedan crobat deck not sure what recovery means that's like healing yourself i i guess step one was the main deck step two was tools step figures recovery cards four draw in search cards and step five okay energy cards in this instance the recovery is using an ordinary rod to get the whimsicott out of your discard pile that's what i was going to say recovering things from discard a very stable eye type mechanic yes okay and then the last bit of tcg news was a collaboration has been finalized between pokemons yeah but you see the transition was like we we we start with the tcg and then we do the tcg slash pokemon go and then it transitions into pokemon go see as a host in my head i had a structure yeah one of these days as the host you might want to put an outline for us yeah you could reveal that to the rest of us the master plan is even though this program is completely scripted anybody's watching the video like i can my eyes keep darting to the side to look at the screen description okay so what does this mean part one of the collaboration is professor willow will appear in the pokemon trading card game in the summer of 2021 which marks the five-year anniversary of pokemon go we plan for this card to be attained obtainable in regions around the world where tcg is sold starting in late may of 2021 we plan to announce art and content of the professor willow card and details on how the card will look in each area does this mean that willow will have a different design for each language um we will then make announcements for further collaborations uh to be determined so we hope you look out for those and then if you didn't know the pokemon trader card game is a two-player game head-to-head card game place in the pokemon video game series you can experience the fun and collecting of the pokemon trading card game building your own decks buying cards from scalpers and using pokemon in battles weird that they included that part on the website yeah scalpers yeah uh i can already tell you what the professor willow card like mechanic is gonna be it's gonna be supporter number one it's gonna be discard your hand trust us what if it's discard your hand to get five candies from a judge what if it was and then the judge brings over a selection of candies for you to take and then you're just down but you have a snack what it was discard your hands searching your deck for three raspberries um yeah i think that i think this is exciting i i think people genuinely do like professor willow i think we could all agree that like when pokemon go came out no one really actually cared about willow or the three team leaders and they're kind of really give them the character we care about sparky yeah we care about sparky i don't think people cared about that dude until he dabbed no everybody cared about that dude because he was awesome because team instinct is amazing right nobody cared about your other boring leaders because they did nothing but stand there and look judgy did they even give them names yeah yeah yes there's spark and then um there's lady blue and lady red gosh what is their name it's not cool yeah exactly blanche blanche her name is the black it is blanche what is the the red lady's name exactly lady red and lady blue no her name is blanche which means white so oddly god choice for names i'm pretty sure it's blanche uh team mystic leader is bland it is blanche but who's the other one i want to say it's uh i do i'm going to say it's victoria because v for valor i don't think that's true i don't think that's how it works either because sparky is not starting with a y yeah but it has a y at the end correct no his name is spark it's not sparky sure i mean it's sparky to his friends exactly those of us okay so it is candela oh candy and spark big fan of the chandelier i bet i guess okay so i think if i i do think it would be cool and i guess let me reread the sentence again starting in late may of 2021 we plan to announce the art and content of the professor willow card and details how the card will look in each area that's such a vague sentence i'm assuming each area is like each different area of where the language changes so like the german cards the italian cards the spanish cards the japanese cards so you have to make a correction what blanche is non-binary they have confirmed oh i thought i thought um candela was non-binary no i just had to look at i just looked this up i didn't know all right i mean i'm into this now i'm into the deep lore i've gone down i've gone down their biographies now this is like when i was telling my friend the other night i was like oh do you know gibraltar is gay in apex legends and he was like what now i'm super into gibraltar and i was like i thought everyone knew this it was like the thing that i didn't i didn't even know there were characters in apex legends yeah yeah there's a non-binary there's a bisexual there's a gay character they got they got lore for every single character it's pretty great i thought gibraltar was an island between spain and africa that is true i didn't know that until after i learned who gibraltar was why would you know basic world geography gibraltar is a sweet name and then i was like oh wait i didn't also didn't know mozambique is like a place i just thought mozambique was a gun and i was like ah mozambique's a bad gun and then i was like look apex elections has taught me a lot the apex legends has taught me more about the world than anything that i did in mps milwaukee public schools it didn't because you thought these things were guns and people but now i know because of apex legends [Music] i this like hurts because i did my whole senior thesis in when i was graduating from university on mozambique and i can tell you so much about mozambique well let's start a new section mozambique cast that's a podcast within a podcast okay so again going back to the center is terrible it's not telling me anything about gibraltar's actual life it just says a gentle giant with a wild side that tells me nothing oh um i think it's just like apex legends.com isn't it then it shows like all the characters and you click on them and it gives you like a three paragraph summary of all of them um okay so starting in late may we plan to announce the art and content of the professor willow card and details on how the card will look in each area they didn't say cards they said card for me if each card if each willow card has different art based on like german english japanese etc i would want to actually collect them all that would be pretty cool uh but i'm going to assume they're not doing that so a card is coming to the tcg based off pokemon go so are we assuming that pokemon go is then getting something tcg based i mean it's a collaboration yeah it doesn't have to go one yeah i i actually i don't think so they could have like uh what in the tcg would come to go that would even make sense like well that's that's what happened um maybe like one of those weird items that only exists in the tcg and not oh de-evolution spray there you go finally you'll get your de-evolution spray i see evolution spray needs to be added it's the main series game but it's gonna be added to go and then it'll be added to the main series game they could have it maybe where you can help it and go you could hold a card like as a hell like as a cosmetic maybe you can have a mega yeah they love to sell clothes and items and stuff like that are there socks in the tv i understand no there are no socks in the tcg or there's no socks in pokemon go maybe you have to maybe you have to buy pokemon cards in pokemon go and then you get a pair of socks with the cards because it's just like going to target to get socks and then you're like well let me grab some pokemon cards since i'm here speaking of sniffing out cards at target this is off pokemon go live.com sniff out legendary pokemon in the searching for legends event what see that transition no uh we are kicking off the search of legends for the search of legendary pokemon any successful search requires a good sense of direction and there's one pokemon equipped to help in that regard it's nosepass chat the compass pokemon will be appearing in greater numbers to help you sniff out the leads to find a variety of ground rock and steel type pokemon starting on tuesday march 9th to sunday march 14th local time the following pokemon will appear more in the wild your digletts your geodudes your magnemite's nosepass air on bald toy rock in rolla your drill bear and more and if you are lucky you may find a shiny nose pass the following pokemon will be

magnemite nosepass aeron baltoi beldum drillberr the following pokemon will appear in one star raids alolan diglett nose pass rock and roller drill bird fera seed yes i'm saying it right you are all saying it wrong and clean the following pokemon will be appearing in three star raids alolan graveler magnamite skarmory metang and if you complete field research task or time research you will encounter pokemon like nosepass so here's the shiny is much better than regular nosepass yeah the shiny is pretty good it's gold okay we've gone 30 minutes into the show pass is so bad it's just so bad let's talk about some drama first i like drama where the drama came from so this was awesome also i'll talk about go canto tour due to a technical issue that occurred from the pokemon go kantho tour some trainers will be were able to access the ticketed portion of the event without purchasing a ticket we talked about this this was uh no we didn't we didn't talk about this this is news to me buddy so when we were playing the go canto tour remember when we were walking around the mall avoiding covid yeah um uh there were there was people people brought to our attention that there were some people had issues and there were going to be a makeup event right but we didn't really talk about the issues we just knew that there was going to be a makeup event like two hours i heard that there was a makeup event but i thought the issue was that it just didn't get turned on for them no they were stupid you know that people oh okay so so why so one issue was people bought tickets but they couldn't pick red or green and so they couldn't actually start the day oh i had that problem a little bit yeah they couldn't they could pick a team so they couldn't start the day until they picked a team but it wasn't letting them pick a team but i think that was only like new zealand like the first early ones the second issue was some people just had the ticket they didn't buy it or anything but they had the whole quest line everything showed up in their profile they were able to do the catch the pallet town hour the viridian hour the fuchsia hour they didn't do anything they just had it um so niantic said they're gonna do makeup event they announced what the makeup event here is um and it's not really an event uh so from friday march 5th so you should have it in your game right now to monday march 5th uh that's not how time works friday march 5th april oh in april not march friday march 5th to april 5th uh you will have timed research and the timed research will give you 30 ultra balls one lure module one poffin one super incubator one lucky egg three pin apps one star piece one elite fast tm which i guess is pretty good one charged elite fast t it's the elite charge tm another a regular charge tm that's useless a fast tm and a hundred mew candy and you will get a bundle for three free remote raid passes in the game shop and that's it so um people were upset because they wanted an actual like time an event where they could go out for x amount of time catch pokemon and have a second chance at you know what was given to us during the canto event instead they there's giving us some items in a field research like format and there are no spawns there are no more hitmonchans in the wild or hitmonlees in the wild there's no laprases you know that's what i think from the majority of what people wanted was pokemon spawns not necessarily just items to make up for it greg you're thinking hard i'm confused as to why we're getting an a month of stuff because some people oh this is not a month of stuff i already finished the first 10 research i mean i've sort of looked at it but whatever but i don't get why why because some people got access without purchasing a ticket we're getting more stuff well no it's for the people who didn't get access even though they had purchased a ticket rather than giving them a refund because that's not mentioned on their website because it says due to technicians that occurred during pokemon go to or cantos some trainers were able to access the ticketed portion of it without purchasing a ticket we apologize for this issue to help trainers who purchase a ticket feel like they're receiving its value paid ticket holders will be able to participate in a bonus event so oh so the people who didn't pay but got a ticket won't get this bonus event yeah he kind of so i i okay hold on okay so why is this even happening okay so okay so non so people who didn't spend twilight let's break this down people who didn't spend 12 got into the event for free and so not on their own accord it just it just happened right they there was no nothing malicious they just they woke up they had the event they were able to participate in it niantic wasn't going to remove it good on niantic for not removing it from these players just you you messed up niantic just give it to them they did so for whatever reason people were upset that they paid to 12 and these people over here didn't that sounds like human beings and the internet both eyes personally because we all come to the show for my opinion apparently i don't care we do those well you're all of our opinion but like if you want my opinion somebody accidentally get somebody who didn't do anything accidentally got into the event didn't ruin or affect my enjoyment of what i paid for like good on them hey they got in cool sometimes things happen in life whatever so when niantic was like we're gonna give you something because we messed up my day wasn't messed up i get that some people they had issues they couldn't connect some people couldn't log in right away some people like i can honestly say from the 12 hours i played or 10 hours i don't know how long it played um it was flaw free like i think even my app only crashed like once and i just had to swipe up and then reload and it was fine like that's just that has nothing that didn't even crash at all which is amazing so like i i can't in good conscious sit on this program or sit in front of an audience and be like man these these rewards suck their niantic owes me more because like i my event was fine like they delivered exactly what they said it was flaw free i had a good time like if they're giving giving me extra items cool but like i i have nothing to complain about the event itself was good like i can't i don't anyways so now here's the problem here's the drama well that that was drama in itself here's the second drama kataku i'm just going to read the headline it's going to explain everything pokemon go holds a makeup event for letting players without tickets sorry pokemon go makeup event for letting players without tickets lets in players without tickets so niantic pushed the makeup event to all the people who bought a ticket but all of those people that accidentally got the ticket in the first place got this event as well oh now i want a double makeup event [Applause] you'd think that [Laughter] [Music] during february's celebration of the 25th anniversary pokemon go featured a pretty a pretty pricey of special event that's what kataku is saying i don't know 12 i thought was okay but i'm an adult celebrating the monsters original homeland the kanto region they charged a hefty 12 dollars to play so people found they could join without having bought a ticket others became angry niantic reacted quickly to and apologized and announced it would hold a special bonus quest chain to make it up uh that started yesterday in australia in new zealand and with just perfect script writing as eurogamer reports it was briefly available to people who haven't paid so you have to think whoever is responsible for switching on the event sat at a computer with 80 different sticky notes around their monitor that says don't make it open to everyone while various colleagues and bosses popped in their hood to say remember don't make it open to everyone then came the moment and it just went into pieces uh and then it talks about how niantics has had issues in the past the the pro okay so yeah i don't i don't know what they do at this point like do they just refund people 12 bucks do they give people a makeup event for the makeup event i i don't know they call all of these people's moms so that their moms can call them and say just because somebody else got something doesn't take away from your experience stop being a mean person just like it it clearly wasn't everybody it was just like so people got it some people got the ticket and then some people who got the ticket that was didn't buy the ticket also got the makeup event as well i mean i do i i side with the people that are like how does niantic keep messing this up i'm not sure well that's understandable i mean that that is quality control is like i know consistent like like it is frustrating when things just get shut off like there was like six months where paris wasn't even in the game anymore yeah um there was an instance you know nobody complained about that somebody didn't complain they added it back that person's literally the worst bug and grass type that exists and then like last week somebody found a shiny paris and they caught it and then it turned into a regular ditto which is frustrating um like i don't understand how you know shinies get turned off i don't understand how pokemon go missing this seems a little bit more complicated than that how are we pushing an event to people who paid when probably in the system it says that these people also i i don't know i get the frustration on that end but i i don't know what they would do to make people happy at this point and i don't know if you can right because those people are already upset that they pay 12 and somebody else didn't pay 12 and they feel like their experience is worse because they i don't know um this is the same issue i have when people say a remake ruins their childhood it's like the remake of your favorite movie did not go back in time and obliterate correct that timeline you still have that experience because somebody else got something for free okay good on them it was a fluke it's like i paid a dollar at a chance at winning the lottery i didn't win it's not a big deal somebody else sometimes went it's not a huge i the fact that people are upset and that this was deliberately to give them give us a month of makeup stuff for people who got for an unknown percentage of people who got free access to an event in error it's been five years they have added a lot to these games code gets wonky over years like something somebody wrote five years ago that somebody didn't fully understand or see or a little bit of weird code got left somewhere causes problems it just happens there's stuff that happens in mmos all the time any sort of constantly updating game where old code still exists when they add something new sometimes something breaks that is what happens it's weird to me to be upset to still learn somebody else got in for free and be like i demand this be made up well i i think the upset part is and i i i really think that it ties back to the thing that i keep saying about pokemon go is when when you're paying for a pokemon go event you're paying for the experience you're not paying for the pokemon that you catch right you're paying i mean that's how we've come to terms with how wacky and weird these events are but yes and and now it's kind of like the the related argument that the complainers are making is i was paying for exclusivity and you failed to exclude these other people right and that's just like what what a what a wrong way to think of the world honestly to go back to the first complaint of well niantic just they're just giving us a bunch of items which is funny because i i've always said on this program like like the mr mime event right if you add up the items you go like that's more than what was mr mime eight dollars like that's more than eight dollars and then greg's argument was like some people don't care about the items so that doesn't mean anything to them which is funny because they release a bunch of items and people went i don't care about the items i care about the pokemon which i kind of now see that point of like yeah those people want pokemon spawns they don't want a bunch of items that you know that as as a makeup event this choices that i agree like i don't think the the the thing that they've listed where we get items makes up for having those spawns who are only supposed to spawn for me although but like we're putting weird we put weird values on chinese anyways like i i get i get like that i get the complaint that there's a weird disconnect that a month that's just giving me a bunch of items that i probably won't use doesn't make up for the fact that i was supposed to get access to these limited things where it falls apart is i still got access to those limited things for the appropriate amount of time but i will tell you this a lawyer and an accountant got into a room together and said how do we provide sufficient monetary value so that when somebody sues us for not making this exclusive event exclusive we can say we actually actually compensated you with monetary value pokemon in pokemon go strangely enough have zero monetary value items that you can purchase in the shop have a designated monetary value well the other problem is they can now say we gave you the opportunity to get twenty dollars worth of items yeah for your twelve dollar ticket yeah yeah there might be legal implic implications i mean there there's not might be there are legal implications for that there's there's no might in that whole thing um legally if they're going to make it up they do have to do something that they can avoid getting sued over through weird closets yeah i would be in the camp where i would want like a three-hour event they did this for the go fest right they were like okay we messed up go fest here's a three-hour saturday event the problem with that though is people can't make that event even if even if you say the event is a month out some people can't get off work they might be traveling a family thing might come up and then you get the compliance of like well they did a makeup event but i couldn't do it or they do the makeup event and you know rng is rng and they go well i did the three-hour makeup event and i didn't get a single shiny so it was completely worthless like this everyone is getting the same rewards in the and in this instance but i do agree with people that like i really did expect like three hours of spawns like i did expect that but we got a bunch of items but also again going back to my start uh that was fine for me i didn't have any issues i i'm not a person to complain but if you had a if you were one of those people where like half the day the game didn't work i do feel bad for you because that sucks it really really sucks that like you spent 12 bucks and you couldn't even play some of the event like that is unfortunate and i like i wish that i think it was a valid that that i think is valid like if you were barred from the thing that you purchased you should either get a refund or something to actually make up the day depending on how it blocked you out like how long were you locked out how long like could you just not play at all i mean there are issues with timing and whatever um i mean at this point niantic should just give everyone who bought a ticket like 1200 coins or whatever just deposit they did this for the first go fest well they gave everyone 100 worth of coins but at this point like just give people 1200 worth of coins let them buy incense or lucky eggs or incubators like because they can't is there anything they can't do another event on top and they can't do an event right for a makeup event and then do another makeup event just give people coins is there anything in this list that you can't buy in the store the at least the mew candy you can't you can't buy the mew candy you can't buy silver pin apps you cannot buy um ultra balls you can't buy um charged tv ultra balls no i don't think so you can't you can get them in the boxes like the free box maybe that's what i'm thinking about okay um you can't buy charge tms or fast charge tms but those come from raids the thing that is actually of value here and of value is depending on how you play dubious yes is the elite fast and elite charge tms those are only available at high levels of go battle league and those are only available during community days where you spend the 12 on that community day scam box and they're only available like once a month to buy and they're minimum like 12 bucks and they're pretty rare i mean that's interesting as far as how they've decided to make this up because as i mean i get it as much as they would love to turn on shinies for a day i'm sure it's not that simple because they have to get clearance and they have to do all the things and look at community days this at least i mean like the list i'm sure this is this is more this would cost you more in the store plus time than the 12 cost you for the event like in that yeah and that viewpoint these these rewards make sense the elite fast and the elite charge is in itself is one of those is worth like the 12 bucks and they're giving you two technically theoretically i mean they're covering they're covering their bases i i get the complaints that it would be better to be able to access the shinies that should have happened during that day i i could see the only way i could see around this is just saying they would turn those shinies on and have them spawn at normal odds throughout this month and just say good luck you have a month to find them but i mean there are people who are never gonna find them but at least that could be a way to sort of negate the i did get my pokemon like you you have a month to try to find them so if it's really really important to use your own time to hunt them down um but like these rewards at least make up for the cost of that ticket i mean granted provided the people who didn't get the ticket are also not getting these but like that's a whole separate issue yeah like there's just that's just it's it's just a buggy code thing um this whole thing is just weird i i mean i i don't hate the items i go i'll eventually do it this month i'm sure i wasn't even aware it was happening until i looked at my page i'm like why is this a thing why are these uh why am i getting new events i did well and also the fact that we haven't been receiving news alerts yeah at all for like a couple of weeks my newsletters have all been code and code i don't understand yeah well we'll find out probably next week what they do to rectify this i guess um there's nothing to do here's the thing you're never going to be happy with somebody's solution period yeah like there are always going to be people who are fine with it and there's always going to be people who are unhappy about it the only person that can close the gap is you so figure out how you make peace with the solution that they came up with because they have a set of criteria that one they're never going to tell you about because they're a corporation two that their legal team is never going to allow them to tell you about because they don't want to get sued and three is hitting as many points as they feel they need to cover both legally and as a corporate good name-wise without breaking the bank without setting weird precedent welcome to corporations and capitalism shake hands with it this is the bed we're sleeping in walk across the bridge also stop bringing agrons to raids i don't want to see your egg right it's one of my best pokemon in a raid what about my mega aggro yeah yeah fine good yeah bring that i don't know just before we go to break psa i've done five to six maybe ten tornadoes i have seen some wild pokemon being brought to tornadoes i saw somebody bring a tauros i saw somebody bring a dodrio i've seen people bring lugia tornadoes is just a flying type pokemon it's weak to rock it's weak to electric it's weak to ice what i'm maybe sure that that tauros has like wild charge i am confident though i am so confident that you probably have an electric type pokemon with electric type moves that you can bring over that tauros i don't understand pokemon go you have become that guy i go to the raid pokemon go picks six and says use these six and those are the six that i use because look i got you in these two situations where i saw these like that when i saw these lugias and i saw these tauros we were in a raid with four me the person who invited me and then in both instances there were different people who invited me i'm not gonna name any names but when somebody invites me to a raid and go i think you know me i'm sporting a mega ampharos right now you better believe i'm showing this bad boy off i join i see there's three other people i go okay that's all right we can do it with four two of those people in both the raids we're 25. we're we're we're working with low-level people here that's fine why are you even playing pokemon go with anybody who's under level 40. it's true that's very true i graced my presence with my mega ampharos um look we both raids went to like 10 seconds left which is fine we were able to do my boy my boy ampharos carried they great but this is this is the this is the the problem which i've always talked about my twitch stream where people don't evolve or they power up pokemon because they are under this mindset like oh the people at the raid told me not to evolve uh anything that isn't a 98 or a higher geodude no look the kanto event just happened you probably caught a million geodudes literally whatever the highest cp one is evolve it you don't have to spend any extra stardust any just evolve the highest cp one you'll have a beefy chunky graveler whatever graveler evolves into golem you'll have a beefy chunky golem that will be great against tornadoes you don't have to spend any stardust you don't have to worry about ivs just in a situation if you're thinking to yourself i'm gonna do a couple tornadoes or what what's after tornadoes thunderous i'm gonna do a couple thunderous just evolve your highest cp1 you'll have good rate counters and then down the line when you have a bunch of stardust and a bunch of candy then you can evolve your 98 uh perfect attack geodude but i am frustrated because you're bringing tauros to a raid and you're probably frustrated because you're not doing a lot of damage and i get this all the time where people are like i don't i don't like to join raids i feel embarrassed i don't have anything good yeah you're right you don't have anything good you got thoros evolve a geodude it's fine you know rock is weak you know flying's weak to rock but all of this time people are so scared to evolve pokemon because of this mindset that has existed in pogo just evolve just catch a high cp one evolve it use it it's fine it'll work it's good you'll be able to go through raids faster no one's gonna no one no one knows when they see your geodude when they see your golem whether it's perfect or not but they'll be like at least they brought the right counter not a tauros people think about this stuff way too much barely notice what the other things are in the ring 100 because i am not looking at my phone i am literally tapping my thumb over the button until it's done look if there's 20 people i just love people who go to raids uh and i'm pretty sure there's people in this conversation right now who are in that set who don't even like try to hit the like big attack button they just like tap everywhere else on the screen except for the big attack button and i'm like i only tap the big attack button because i want it to go off the second it's available you are in a raid with 20 people by all means bring sixth antler i encourage it it'll be fine if all 20 people brought six stantler each i guarantee you the raid will be able to be complete i'm just saying when there's only four people and we're down to timer i don't want to see that tauros or that egg around across me maybe they already went through their golem and they're down to what they didn't they started with a loop and lugia is not even super effective against tornadoes i mean look at you taking notes on other people's business playing with you because the reason i took notes is because i had to actually look at the video game to play it normally i'm just like tap tap tap tap tap we're good i'll see you guys in 60 seconds when it's over i'm gonna look ahead in this instance i'm like i have to optimize i'm gonna wipe right here i'm gonna end the game early i gotta revive six get back in uh that's fine look if you need pogo help let let me know in the in the discord or the slack i'll help you out we'll get you some good counters okay let's take a break when we come back we got some sword and shield stuff and yeah that's about it just some sort and shield stuff left and then question the week in pokemon of the week we will be right back dance dance dance [Music] dance dance dance abundance abundance [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and we are back from our break the final bit of netflix stuff is happening well i guess whatever um off pokemon.com the adventure continues with netflix pokemon the journey 12 new episodes are now available these are the final 12 episodes of this season it will go from episode 37 to 48 and i get well the press release kind of says what happens i don't spoil it for anyone so we'll just skip that part i know some people are not completely caught up with the pokemon anime so that's available hash and go will go on great adventures throughout a tiny tiny tiny tiny world they will catch pokemon pokemon will evolve uh they will instantly teleport from johto to sinnoh in less than five seconds it's very fascinating i do want to say uh moving on to some sword and shield news here is that you can still get the pikachu with sing um and you can still get the toxicity from gamestop if you're in the us eb games if you're in canada if you're out side of said two countries i just named check with your local game store uh but it should be available everywhere i believe the toxicity and the pikachu just go for another like two weeks i don't have the exact dates in front of me but you're listening to this podcast so if you don't do something now bobby you're going to forget anyways so it doesn't matter if i tell you what the date is if you you're going to go like oh yeah i should do that and then like not do it um bobby so do it [Music] i got six codes some other sword and shield news here is there is a new competition taking place in sword and shield this is the spike month cup named after the [ __ ] the gym with no dynamics the rule is you can't dynamax in this in this online competition so unfortunately as it turns out it's singles not doubles uh it will take place from wednesday oh sorry you can register from wednesday march 3rd to thursday march 18th and then the competition will take place thursday march 18th through the march 21st uh they have the eligible pokemon listed it's three verse three you do get 50 battle points for participating no shirt or anything just 50 battle points i'm out the whole gimmick is you don't dynamics i saw some people being like oh they're listening to us we hate dynamaxx first off that's a small majority of people secondly that's the majority of people third um thirdly did they not play the game do they not did they not just re like i instantly little and i saw the title spike month cup i the first thing i thought was oh this is going to be no dynamics because that is the whole gimmick of his gym yes is he doesn't believe in dynamics the talking about minorities and majorities the majority of competitive vgc players play enough of the game to the point where they can do everything they need to do to get their vgc team and then stop playing which is probably gym number three so they never got to spikeness you're right no the uh i feel like yeah maybe probably gym three actually maybe jim like one maybe they don't even need to get to a gym i i well willa said a lot of competitive players will just get to the point of the game where they can build up daycare's right after that first gym so you i mean you would get yeah you would have to get past the first ship you'd have to get past milo to get to the majority of competitive players aren't even breeding their own pokemon true look true cheer look look give them give some of them the benefit of the doubt okay yeah sure um i was excited well i'm not excited singles i was excited they were doing this just because i do like weird dynamac i do like weird battle formats like they did us back in ultrasound ultramoon they did like a spooky cup you were all allowed to use like ghost type pokemon and that was really cool uh and they've kind of been even though they've been really good at like changing the rules every season um and putting out these competitions which you know and this is the first time we had a we have had a real change in like every whatever two three months because we're on rule we're on eight the rule version eight uh and the game's been out a little over a year this just like they kind of there's not been anything zany or wacky [Laughter] like give me only grass pokemon or give me only a lowland slash galleria forums or that one competition where it was like you had to have a pikachu on your team or it was like all electric types competition this was a long time ago because i was still living in dc so i don't remember that one i feel like there was like a holiday one where it was like you're allowed to do like deliberate and stantler and jinx and pikachu and cherubi pikachu is for every yeah event uh pikachu is forever every holiday is a pikachu holiday if you try hard enough i felt like there was like one didn't they do one where it was like pokemon standing on all fours am i imagining this where like they had to be like no that sounds familiar where like they couldn't be bipedal they had to just be on like all four legs i don't remember i pedal bipedal doesn't matter okay i know what you're trying to say that's all the news i'm actually very sure we're missing something it's been a long week i mean i looked around i'm not seeing much we can talk about masters if we really wanted oh yeah we are missing masters uh yeah there's not a lot to talk about leon is in the game you pulled leon i did i did too well congrats i have not called marnie marnie has eaten all of my gems i got leon in my first set and then uh still no marty and marnie's at two percent uh leanne is what literally the most overpowered pair they put in the game leon yeah i think red is still better i think so what happens when you dynamics charizard because that was the big question last week nothing yeah okay so dynamaxx isn't in the game yet uh they said they were gonna have that happens they okay yeah you when you use the sync move which is ultimately like a z move um it does the explosion exploding animation but there is no dynamics i believe they talked they said that dynamics is coming right this is not a pipe dream of mine for full disclosure i am partnered with dna so i do know that some some stuff you would know more than i yeah but i don't know what i'm allowed to say and not say i'm pretty sure they said dynamics is coming i'm pretty sure we all filled out a survey that said that we want dynamaxx and dynamics is coming i mean that's i don't know where leon falls in the actual power power list he's number two i believe grid uh so the top two are are charizard put them both on your team char it up you can technically have three charizards if you want because you can get a charizard from the egg and you can assign it but then who is it partnered with okay you just pick who you partner with you partner with yourself yeah you partner with your main character yeah they did say this okay sweating for a second okay this is uh this is really expecting i always say this i was really expecting when i used sync when i would sync move leon for dynamaxx what i would see the dynamics thing and it would cut back to the three pairs and we would just see charizard's giant foot and nothing else on screen that was my wish that did not happen i was very disappointed in this game okay this is uh this is from january 14th dynamaxx in development for our two year anniversary we're working to bring you to bring you battles that have dynamax pokemon with this feature we hope to provide a new way for players to enjoy battles for more details it'll be available at a later date so stay tuned so they they did say that um there's like no one no one in the entire world would not think that leon charizard wouldn't be the first pair to dynamax like like they're not gonna put leon into the game and be like uh well we gave him charizard but also he can't dynam like he is going to be able to dynamex um and that would make his charizard different than reds charizard because red's charizard can mega evolve um and your charizard can your if you get an egg charizard that cannot mega evolve or dynamics it's just can it z move well yeah well when you use the z move in masters that's what mega evolves you so you do the move and then you make evolve after them yes you sync move the sync move uh there's some cool events going on masters right now there's the the yell event which is pretty okay you can get yeah um and then there's the champion event yeah the champion event with this with the going through the map although i felt like the first half of the storyline for the champion event was good and then they were just like we have eight more things to fill in for conversations so let's just have people talk to each other i do like i do like leon and marnie's and piers's voices i think they did a good job those are very good uh did you get have you gotten to the uh stephen lance and leon conversation no i haven't gotten there yet okay that is that is currently my favorite conversation in the game they have a very good conversation about a very very important topic to two of them okay um this is also pokemon.com uh in weeks ahead you can look forward to iris champion iris with high dragon who will arrive on march 17th diantha and gardevoir will arrive on march 30. finally finally i know and i've wasted my co i said i was gonna waste my stuff on marnie and i did so now i have to build up to get the greatest champion in my roster was already in the game two cynthias uh gloria and zashian will return i have returned um and then uh they say brace yourself for uh the blissful bonanza it's coming back it's where you knock out the blisseys and get the lucky tickets and stuff what is that for you you you know you really know what we you always do the blissey bonanza it's really really good because you knock them out you get lucky tickets and then you get lucky tickets to like change your skills oh it's just to get the lucky cookies right yeah yeah yeah yeah the lucky cookies cause the lucky cookies are random yeah but you you but the blissey gives you a ton of them and then you spend you spend your rng re-rolling your abilities and then you spend them all and then you go i didn't get the good one so i guess i'll wait for the next [ __ ] banana what are the good ones i don't know like like a lot of people like um gosh i can't remember what it's called on stephen but it's it's it's something where you get health back depending on damage you do cause metagross metagross has no recovery so when you but but metagross has high flinch so you like flinched all of them and then you get health back that's really good i can't remember what ability that's called uh and then finally we're adjusting your sync pair grids to be easier than ever players will automatically be able to convert co-op sync orbs that's because they don't do co-op anymore create present synchroid builds and reset individual tiles instead of in resetting your entire sync grid these new features are available in the upcoming select multiple feature that will let players allow multiple sync grids at a time and then they yeah so that's iris is coming diantha is coming dynomax is coming i don't know i think pogba masters is still what it is if you haven't tried it probably a good time to log in because there's a bunch of free gems if you have tried it and you didn't like it probably this update's not going to convince you it's still the same game now we'll see how we'll see how much dynamics changes okay greg question of the week all right ready gotta lubricate up all right now's the time in the podcast for the question of the week [Music] i see you didn't have it chosen no i have it right here i just had to click the expand uh this is from brandon from our slack community what is your favorite pokemon event that you've been to in the past 10 years and the past 20 years uh i have to know when the events were wait say that say it again repeat the question because i there were numbers that i did your favorite pokemon event you've been to in the past 10 years and then your favorite pokemon event you've been to in the past 20 years uh all right so 20 years is easy uh it's gonna be the one where you schooled all the kids at the mall of america no that was that was that was that was in chicago i was in chicago no you're loris steve jeez uh i only schooled one child uh and two teens and i was showing off my torchic uh game boy advance i was very popular at the chicago event no i'm sure you are uh pokemon rocks america that was in the parking lot of mall of america uh in 2004 because parking lot or west parking lot uh so it was the north parking lot when there was nothing there because there's an ikea there now but swedish i actually had friends fly in from california to attend that event so it was one of the first ever uh people came to do a pokemon event that i got to beat with friends and hang out and do all pokemon stuff uh so that was my favorite for 20 years the next years when i went to chicago pokemon rocks america two or more i don't know why it was at navy pair in chicago uh and i went to that alone and schooled a bunch of children i have to think of what happened in the last 10 years what else there was there's the black and white event that steve and i were at the mall of mirror together we didn't know each other that's true were you there when that person like fell down at the pokemon center and started bleeding yeah yeah so we were that close to each other yes well we didn't know each other yeah yeah cause okay this is this is a sad story they they had a pop-up pokemon center at mall of america this is for the black and white tour which i traveled towards which was going to be on my list of like favorite things i did i got a bunch of my co-workers this you know the moment where you like you know the moment in pokemon where you are out of pokemon and you want to get back into pokemon but you have to like convince somebody else to get into pokemon with you this is like this is like somebody somebody listening to this would be like yes so you like you go to like your friend and you're like hey new pokemon games are coming out you should get one version i should get the other one we should play it together it'll be like pokemon's lame and it's like yeah but nostalgia and then you convince them and then you secretly both know that pokemon wasn't lame it was just like right you needed that person to go to the bathroom with you that kind of situation um okay sure no no okay so like that that's what happened with my co-workers when black and white came out because i was already into pokemon i was already doing a pokemon podcast at the time and then they were like kind of kind of getting into pokemon they were like getting interested because black and white was very new and it appealed to a lot of people that you know haven't played pokemon in a while and i i i wouldn't say i alone convinced them but together as a group not only did i not only did the four of us agree to get black and white together but we also agreed to rent a hotel outside of mall america drive six hours to there and attend this the mall the black and white tour um which i would have never done solo like there's no way i would have just gotten in the car and drove to mall of america by myself to like walk around the mall and be like i like pokemon i mean i think now i would but 10 years ago no so anyways we there's a there was a pop-up pokemon center at the mall of america was in the first floor and there was a huge line but it wasn't as long as the line to play the wii because they had the nintendo wii on display and that was insane like it was like a five hour wait to play like 10 minutes of nintendo wii um so we got a line for the pokemon center because we were there the day before the games launched so it was open and i can't remember um the line wasn't terribly long but somebody behind us i don't know where greg was but they were they were literally the couple behind us um they just like fainted and no one caught them so their head hit the ground and then they just started bleeding um and i believe they had a seizure i wasn't i'm not 100 sure but i believe that's what it was uh and then paramedics and everything came and then there was this really awkward situation of like do we leave the line like what because we weren't like blocking them like they they because we were in the roped off part they were in like the open before the roped off part and then everyone at the pokemon center just kept working and so we yeah what else are you gonna do we bought our plushes and then we watched them get carried away and it was like a really sad moment this one also for the record it says what is your favorite experience like that's not my why because it was favorite it's just i remember it but now i'm i didn't know that greg also saw that same thing because like what is the likelihood of that that you had to be there on that day and it's not like it's one person fainting in a in a huge time i was there with my friend uh nursey who's a doctor and when the p we we were aware that the paramedics arrived and i remember saying shouldn't you go over there and help and he's like no that's why the paramedics are here uh so we weren't waiting in line we were just in the area we i just remember the paramedics arriving [Music] what was going on yeah but it was what 2000 and it was whatever was that it was literally the year that black and white came out yeah but it had been 2010 uh wait no black and white came out in 2011 because i recently had a social media memory of i'm going to start i'm going to gamestop to get pokemon white when did you get married greg 2012 2014 oh okay so yeah you were you probably weren't even listening to the podcast then no i wasn't um uh because i don't think i started i started listening to the podcast at i want to say it was episode and the line was probably for the eu which came out in 2012 not oh yeah you're right 2006. yeah you're right it was for the wii u yes because because i cuz you could at the mall of america you could go up to like the second or third floor and you could look down because they they built like um they built like a castle or whatever and you could look down and people were doing the golf game where um like you put the wii on the ground and then you like tee it off with the wemo oh yeah yeah yeah so you could like see people playing the wii from the inside but if you were on the ground floor you couldn't see because they built walls up like a castle uh but that's why mall america is kind of cool because you go up floors and then you look down you can but that whole tour they're doing that whole tour gosh i remember like going in getting the games and then like walking over to like a restaurant in the restaurant hallway and then like sitting down and like redeeming the victini code i remember like yesterday they had like blown-up restaurants and they did and then you got pictures and then they had an area where you could um just literally sit down and they had movies going they had like a projector yep i remember um and then they had multiple stamp stations this was the like yeah this is like the this i i do always hate when people say like oh pokemon is for kids uh but like this thing was specifically for kids it was like it was like eight stamps it was like a little book and then um you would have to go to different places in the mall and then like you had to go to the restaurants that graham and get your stamp and then you had to go damn rambling yeah you had to go to the movie get your stamp well i don't know stamp rallies are like really big in japan but i would assume that was like all ages for japan but then they i don't know maybe they negotiated but one of them you had to go into like macy's and another one you had to actually like go in in nordstrom to get the stamps yeah you did uh you had to go to a bunch of places in the mall which is why i just wasn't doing it i remember we went i was there for a couple of hours i we we're gonna wait for the wii u and decided no we'll just get we'll just get it i don't wanna it's fine uh i bought a sniper plush uh what did i get i think i got a jirachi and a ted pig i don't know where that ted pig is anymore oh the love uh and then the thing happened and then we were just like uh do we want to do the stamp thing and then like no i didn't stamp thing uh we looked at the movie for a bit then we just went shopping and had food and then we left i don't think i think it was there for a chunk of time but not uh not the entire day but yeah we were because we talked later and when you said you're there i'm like oh yeah we probably saw each other because i was generally i'm always generally aware of the age demographic like like are there people around my age and just i generally look i just i generally watch people because i'm a people watcher uh just out of habit as i like for acting reasons picking up what other people do and how they hold themselves so i probably saw you and had no clue who you were i don't think i might have still no i was i was out of my chain while at faze no no you weren't i know i was i was no chain wallet you were still into chain while it's when we hung out and that was like 2012. pokemon us nationals yes you had a chain wallet yeah you did busted wait what was your favorite event will well i still have to figure out what was ten years i think okay i'm gonna go with 10 years i will say the go fest that we all went to in chicago that was pretty had a lot of fun at that one that's not a great musical i saw a bunch of people i liked uh the day was nice uh i would say in the last 10 years that's the most memorable uh well i don't have it 20 years because i didn't go to any pokemon events at all until 2012. uh my favorite pokemon event boy i mean i've done a bunch of stuff with you guys yeah it's like what does that count yeah that counts the original pokemon go fest no because steve made us stay there until 11 o'clock at night no no no no we need to we didn't leave until 1am what are you talking about the second one with me was great no we you went to the third one because this is the second second one was the one where you had to walk up and down uh was it lincoln park and it was it was raining in the morning when it was the third one it was raining in the morning and then it was just like this brutal heat wave at like 3 p.m it was awful uh but i think we got raisin canes after that but yeah that did become our tradition to get keynes after pokemon go event which i love me some canes um so i guess out of other things that i've done with you guys uh i did go to a pokemon regional like a vgc competition in dumfries virginia with like dumbfruit dumfries dumfries d-u-m-f-r-i-e-s right uh is it wasn't something skepticism about a place that exists yeah yeah for somebody who lives next to like waukesha oh yes i can tell you the worst pokemon event i've been to was in [ __ ] rapids minnesota oh boy that was awesome nothing good happens including why were you in [ __ ] rapids minnesota okay oh boy either way i went with my buddy john we had a nice day i have a picture of me with a blow up zekrom and resharam and that was like my first time ever going to like a pokemon event so that was a lot of fun for me uh that was that was when irene and i were very into competitive pokemon and we were visiting uh i believe we were doing a christmas and it was like june it was january like 12th or something right you're doing christmas no no we went to irene's parents they couldn't like christmas was always like the weekend of new year's but somebody was out of town so we pushed it one week so it was like january 12th and so we did christmas friday night and then saturday we hung out with her family and then sundays normally when we come back to milwaukee and then we just checked the like oh sundays we normally play pokemon at some tournament we saw that there was like a tournament in [ __ ] rapids that weekend and we're like oh cool [ __ ] rapids is literally on the way back from st cloud minnesota i mean not exactly in the way but it's it's not out of the way so we're like we should stop the tournament starts at noon i mean we could leave your parents house at like 10 it takes 90 minutes to get there um and of course they'd like did the minnesota goodbye so that took like an hour so we're like okay so we got there at like 11 59 or whatever and the tournament started at 12. we're like hey we're all the way from milwaukee can we register and they were they like kind of threw like a hissy fit they were like oh well you know it starts in a minute and i was like yeah that's if you want to give us a round one loss that's fine like no big deal and they're like no no no you were technically here on time and they like redid the player matching sheets which i don't think they really did so round one uh they paired me against irene so it's like cool glad we drove all this way so we can verse each other in this tournament um so we played our match and then i think we played one or two other matches uh that day and then just the people there were like really rude um and irene was like i'm the only black person here and i was like yeah let's go that sucks yeah um yeah they're just like really like i that was my only time in [ __ ] rapids but i don't think i'd ever go back what a weird city i mean there's nothing there so you don't really need to go back yeah that's probably the worst uh favorite pokemon event i've been to in the last 10 years i don't know i like to go fast a lot no one brought up the pokemon symphonic evolution stuff that was pretty sweet the concerts oh yeah i went with joe that was really good well actually i saw it like twice because i saw it at the the world championships the first time they were in dc because that's where they debuted it and then i saw it at the um wolf trap with joe i think i went to one i think it went to the one that was that was here but i saw it in dc it was really bad that was such a bad experience the dc one i wonder oh the because the person who i was sitting next to that was just the most obnoxious person there i i think her friends i think her friends escorted her out halfway through but she insisted on talking to me even though it's never met her before in my life throughout the concert while the music was going on she insisted on talking to me were they playing like trainers eyes meet no but it was like they played music from pokemon crystal and she was like oh this was the first game where you could play as a girl and i just remember when i was you know whatever years old and i was so excited that i could finally play i'm like i don't know you and i don't care i'm trying to enjoy the performance ahead of me i went to the one in milwaukee and uh that team the sephonic evolution team actually reached out to me before they came to milwaukee and they offered me free tickets and i think mr fans they offered i think on the show we played a couple samples because they were like hey can you advertise it for us this was before like the fdc got real strict about ads and stuff um so i think we played a few samples and then i like i met up with them because they like the the guy who ran it was like hey just you know shoot me a text when you're here uh and then they asked if i wanted to get dinner with the staff afterwards so like irene and i got dinner with the people who put on the show like the conductors and the musicians and like the staff and the programmer and the director and all that stuff and then at dinner they were like well chicago's gonna be tomorrow do you guys want to come to chicago too and i was like yeah i guess so we like the next day we drove down to chicago we saw the same exact show although it was better in chicago i mean like when you're comparing milwaukee musicals to chicago's musical chicago way way better it was exactly the same how was it different you know they had a little more pizzazz and they're like this is the violin what are you talking about is it it's the same tour group yeah exactly this is your confirmation button you guys this is your heart is different you know the acoustics greg the acoustics you can't if you want good acoustics then you should come to the one in minneapolis to go to orchestra hall where you can crumple a dollar bill on stage without a microphone and hear it all the way at the top in the third balcony they showed us this as children that was the thing we did uh that was pretty cool um there was a regionals i top cut that was pretty sweet oh you didn't bring up your thing when you you beat the champion in line now that you keep breaking i did beat wolf yeah that's true that's true uh nobody believes i have i found a picture of it there's a picture of me and wolf glick baby wolf click baby me too uh we were playing uh against there was a trash can in the background it was very the scenery was pretty yeah that is prove that you win you need i want i i have it i went on twitter wolf click saying i was beat by sb no that's never going to happen if there's anything that wolf lick doesn't remember it's battling me at like the 2011 now years ago exactly ten years ago you know what they say for you that was the greatest day in your life like it was a tuesday ah i i'm sure i have the match of me against wolf glick somewhere that'd make good youtube comment content i'll give my commentary of a 12 year old match against wolf click uh where i beat him with a basketland and maractus because it was a gimmick it was it was the two out of three you would have gotten stumped it was two i think we did do two out of three oh now the now the whole everything you just keep changing everything yeah well yeah i think it was i think it was best i think it was best seven out of ten i think so you know uh pokemon of the week all right all right last week's pokemon of the week a sea creature that you have to take up on a mountain to evolve what is it it's krabby you almost said the right thing the most forgettable pokemon out there you know you're not wrong but but the thing is too like what really struck me about cremitable is it was in alola end of sentence yeah it has never never existed before has not existed was not brought into galler yes for you know fighting ice no shell like that don't even come don't even come at me it's or does it have a shovel like him it should it's a it's a cool book it does oh it's bad that's okay weird like who who would have thought hey let me take this little crab thing up on a mountain and use it to battle oh wait now it's evolved yeah i feel like it's one of those pokemon where they're just like giving a nice stone in the future and call it a day yeah no they will never it will never it'll never be moving abominable trivia will be this was in one game two games technically and never again never heard it was one of the first fighting types you got though right brawler was so there was like cor brawler is fighting only and then credominable is ice fighting right rommel is the only ice type pokemon introduced in gen 7. no other pokemon has the same type combination uh cr crab ah ah bull i can't ever say it crab ominable has the longest english name of any pokemon with 12 letters because they dropped the e for alligator still mad about that i talk about lazy you want to talk about game freak being lazy couldn't even figure out how to fit an e for alligator's name look there were data limits that had to be respected they had in okay this is the truth they when they dropped the e they found room to put all of kanto copy and paste the charizard carbohy and its pre-evolved form are the only fighting type pokemon to have an insectoid body is that is does buzzwell not count [Music] hmm because i don't think that i don't think brawler is an insect i i think it's more of a um crustacean or a what is a spider what what is that a arachnid the only ice type pokemon to have an inside body i think they're talking about how like the pokemon games have like the little uh icons and you know how like tyranitar looks like a little like dragon and like the snake icon and the head icon i think that's what they're talking about i don't remember how the game uses those icons though oh yeah it's the shape it's the shape the shape and buzzwole has like an octopus looking shape where chrominable has like a little caterpillar-looking shape got it yeah don't i can't say where in the games you actually ever see them there was one okay kerbominable card that was introduced in the tcg i think it was maybe around the time of crimson invasion and it was like a very cheap budget deck that people ran um and that's the gist of it it was like it was like an okay cheap budget deck that worked pretty consistently um but it wasn't oh it was like a b maybe like a b or c tier deck it wasn't like an a that is like 75 of pokemon tcg decks that exist that they're just like for okay and then 25 are meta yeah or like uh 99 or adp it came full circle the whole podcast was full circle there you go give us our next week's pokemon this week's pokemon belongs to a pokemon family that includes members that are every type other than fighting flying poison ground rock bug go steel and dragon in most games it required access to a specific location to evolve i guess they didn't originally have these in kanto johto or hoen in one episode of the pokemon cartoon it is revealed that cynthia has this pokemon as she has it used the ice beam attack to freeze some river water to aid in ailing mellowetta this pokemon has only ever been catchable in the wild in galler which is also the first place where evolving into this pokemon relied on a held item rather than a specific location there you go okay well uh this has been the episode hopefully you enjoyed it thanks for making it to the end uh if you did make it to the end what is it what is our word this week will i now i came up with last word last last week's greg's turn greg what is the word this week uh hmm uh i'll be uh i will be yeah like the owl like that like the animal the owl yeah and then b like uh the insect the insect oh it's like a bug bear which used to just confuse the heck out of me so if they spell it if they spell it wrong then they're not a true fan the animal out there if they spell it a-l-b-i then that means that somebody told them hey it's alby okay uh thanks for making it to the end uh if you're if if you missed i
