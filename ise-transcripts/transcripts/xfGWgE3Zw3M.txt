I'm your host SBJ with me Greg hello (1:20 - 1:27)
hello it's a rainy day here in Minnesota (1:24 - 1:30)
which allowed me to catch no shiney (1:27 - 1:32)
carvanha the antic looking out for you I (1:30 - 1:35)
know I didn't help that I was so we went (1:32 - 1:37)
grocery shopping and I forgot about it (1:35 - 1:38)
and then I came home and you were (1:37 - 1:41)
streaming so I fired it up and I did an (1:38 - 1:42)
hour with my incense and then I promptly (1:41 - 1:45)
fell asleep and then I woke back up at (1:42 - 1:48)
4:30 with half an hour left and did (1:45 - 1:50)
another incense I'm like oh who's I (1:48 - 1:54)
sleeping but my main goal today happened (1:50 - 1:58)
I caught three scraggy so I count that (1:54 - 1:59)
as a win for me (1:58 - 2:00)
yeah that's pretty alright and you got (1:59 - 2:03)
an app that's on sweet and I got an app (2:00 - 2:06)
with two dogs will is also here thank (2:03 - 2:07)
you for allowing me to go second because (2:06 - 2:10)
now I'm about to take up you haven't (2:07 - 2:13)
knew it several hours of your time so (2:10 - 2:15)
I'm a free face that this is a Pokemon (2:13 - 2:19)
yes let's get the the small things out (2:15 - 2:25)
of the way first small thing I didn't do (2:19 - 2:32)
the car vanya event because I see a (2:25 - 2:36)
Shinto a caravan yeah I got all set up (2:32 - 2:37)
to do it and then I just got distracted (2:36 - 2:40)
by a butterfly and couldn't remember to (2:37 - 2:43)
get back to doing it so that's number (2:40 - 2:46)
two I am now proven bad at video games (2:43 - 2:51)
because part a didn't realize that I (2:46 - 2:53)
could use wishing pieces to complete my (2:51 - 2:56)
pokedex until I don't know when I texted (2:53 - 2:58)
you guys yesterday morning this morning (2:56 - 3:01)
pause what did you think wishing pieces (2:58 - 3:04)
were full I just didn't put it together (3:01 - 3:10)
that you just like I thought like when I (3:04 - 3:12)
would read in boba pedia and it was like (3:10 - 3:15)
oh you can get a jag moto from a max (3:12 - 3:17)
rate and I was like I have to wait for (3:15 - 3:20)
that to be written up in the game for me (3:17 - 3:24)
to go to to find that not for that like (3:20 - 3:27)
oh hey I can activate this day (3:24 - 3:29)
and that dude that I'm looking for it (3:27 - 3:33)
might just be in there so that's that's (3:29 - 3:35)
the realization I've come to six months (3:33 - 3:39)
later can I give you a pro tip sure so (3:35 - 3:40)
if you have to Denton's close to each (3:39 - 3:43)
other and you don't want to do the den (3:40 - 3:45)
you drop the wishing piece into you just (3:43 - 3:47)
go to the other den drop the wishing (3:45 - 3:49)
piece and then I decide if you want to (3:47 - 3:50)
do that if that's not good enough go to (3:49 - 3:52)
the back to the other den drop the (3:50 - 3:53)
wishing piece so you can go back and (3:52 - 3:55)
forth between two but they stay lit if (3:53 - 3:58)
you say you can only have one wishing (3:55 - 4:01)
piece active at a time when dropping a (3:58 - 4:03)
second wishing piece you deactivate the (4:01 - 4:05)
first one Wow (4:03 - 4:07)
but then I wasted up wishing well it (4:05 - 4:08)
would have been wasted anyways cuz I (4:07 - 4:10)
wasn't gonna go after that did na yeah (4:08 - 4:12)
that's probably true also wait there's (4:10 - 4:13)
no dedenne in this game (4:12 - 4:18)
I'm sorry Tokido Maru but that's not (4:13 - 4:20)
even the important thing here's the (4:18 - 4:22)
important thing bar P of I'm not good at (4:20 - 4:25)
video games and the beginning of I have (4:22 - 4:31)

deep folks I hope you're ready strap in (5:34 - 5:39)
because I'm about to blow your minds (5:37 - 5:42)
Animal Crossing is not some nice game (5:39 - 5:44)
for children to play it is the North (5:42 - 5:49)
Korea simulator this man this Tom Nook (5:44 - 5:51)
is a dictator who has tricked you into (5:49 - 5:54)
his socialist paradise where we're all (5:51 - 5:57)
judged by the value of the work that we (5:54 - 5:59)
put in and we're all contributing to (5:57 - 6:01)
society except strangely enough it seems (5:59 - 6:03)
that only one of me is contributing to (6:01 - 6:05)
society and what do I have to do I have (6:03 - 6:08)
to build this island to his standards (6:05 - 6:12)
and regulations and you know I have like (6:08 - 6:14)
a rating oh how well are you doing oh (6:12 - 6:15)
you've got enough trees wait no you (6:14 - 6:17)
don't have enough trees too many trees (6:15 - 6:19)
people are getting lost in the forest (6:17 - 6:21)
oh all of this senseless work just to (6:19 - 6:24)
keep my hands occupied and he's got his (6:21 - 6:27)
secret police aka the happy home Academy (6:24 - 6:29)
peering in my windows and walking in my (6:27 - 6:31)
unlocked door to judge how I'm living (6:29 - 6:34)

listen to Island announcements about (6:34 - 6:38)
this is what we are going to be doing on (6:36 - 6:40)
the island today Thank You Isabelle (6:38 - 6:43)
right hand to the dictator but this is (6:40 - 6:44)
where it was all revealed to me was when (6:43 - 6:47)
the whole thing is a scheme because if (6:44 - 6:49)
there's anything that a North Korean (6:47 - 6:52)
dictator loves it is cult of personality (6:49 - 6:56)
celebrity handshakes and this whole (6:52 - 6:58)
island that I have been building for (6:56 - 7:01)
this person is just to attract Kay Kay (6:58 - 7:05)
slider to come and play cake a lament (7:01 - 7:08)

Pokemon TCG the pokken tournament DX and (11:32 - 11:41)
pokemon sword and shield all announced (11:37 - 11:44)
for online tournaments i think the only (11:41 - 11:46)
people happy about this are probably the (11:44 - 11:48)
pokken tournament people because they (11:46 - 11:52)
have zero expectation the fact that the (11:48 - 11:54)
game is still alive is good enough for (11:52 - 11:58)
them somebody remembered me how nice (11:54 - 12:02)
okay so the TCG okay let's put that one (11:58 - 12:03)
on the backburner (12:02 - 12:06)

to register directly for the first stage (12:15 - 12:20)
of the Pokemon players cup at a (12:18 - 12:24)
future date yeah I think I think I mean (12:20 - 12:25)
I think all pokken players are happy (12:24 - 12:27)
that their game is still getting love I (12:25 - 12:30)
don't like what happens in is this this (12:27 - 12:32)

in the May international challenge to (15:37 - 15:42)
qualify for the Pokemon players Cup this (15:39 - 15:44)
weekend you're listening to this podcast (15:42 - 15:49)
on time and not in the in 2022 you will (15:44 - 15:52)

256 for North America top 256 if you're (15:55 - 16:02)
in Europe top 128 if you're in Oceania (15:59 - 16:05)

pokemon events for the online tournament (16:18 - 16:25)

or older to participate in these I think (16:25 - 16:29)
the sword and shield stuff is pretty (16:28 - 16:31)
straightforward they've already figured (16:29 - 16:34)
out in the past to link to award points (16:31 - 16:37)
to people this is maybe why they've been (16:34 - 16:39)
pretty strict on banning people who are (16:37 - 16:44)
purposely disconnecting and I have no (16:39 - 16:46)
worries that they're going to be (16:44 - 16:47)
watching (16:46 - 16:48)
people disconnecting through this (16:47 - 16:49)
tournament if they have not already (16:48 - 16:55)
fixed it or a remedy remedy it did it (16:49 - 16:59)
enough up to this point the only maybe (16:55 - 17:01)
complaint is like this is kind of super (16:59 - 17:02)
short notice here's the tournament (17:01 - 17:04)
here's the event you got to qualify you (17:02 - 17:07)
got like less than two weeks yeah kind (17:04 - 17:09)
of hard to build a team and compete and (17:07 - 17:10)
everything in that amount of time but (17:09 - 17:14)
school's out yep but we didn't think the (17:10 - 17:16)
Pokemon company was gonna do something (17:14 - 17:17)
but shout out to them like it's actually (17:16 - 17:19)
really cool that they were still trying (17:17 - 17:23)
to make this work especially when the (17:19 - 17:25)
majority people have nothing but good (17:23 - 17:27)
things to say about the current sword (17:25 - 17:31)
and shield competitive meta okay can I (17:27 - 17:34)
ask my good question let's talk about (17:31 - 17:37)
the Pokemon Trading Card Game (17:34 - 17:39)
[Laughter] (17:37 - 17:43)
so I have a deck of my physical cards (17:39 - 17:46)
that I was going to bring to the thing (17:43 - 17:49)
like the actual live tournament okay now (17:46 - 17:53)
it's online uh-huh how do I get my deck (17:49 - 17:57)
that I paid money for into who the (17:53 - 18:02)
computer game you don't yeah that's not (17:57 - 18:10)
how it works you have to oh boy talk (18:02 - 18:12)
about the history of the Pokemon Trading (18:10 - 18:14)
Card Game online it's made by direwolf (18:12 - 18:16)
digital and it was released in web (18:14 - 18:19)
browsers on March 24th 2011 and then (18:16 - 18:22)
moved over to Windows as an application (18:19 - 18:30)
on May 15th 2012 2012 8 years old and in (18:22 - 18:32)
nowhere in those 8 years have they've (18:30 - 18:34)
ever done this before I am NOT saying (18:32 - 18:38)
direwolf digital is bad I think they're (18:34 - 18:42)
maybe not given enough money slash (18:38 - 18:45)
resources from the Pokemon company to do (18:42 - 18:49)
what they want to do I mmm don't know (18:45 - 18:52)
who those battle animations are real (18:49 - 18:55)
sweet sure (18:52 - 18:55)
when unbroken bonds came out which was (18:57 - 19:04)
not that long ago there was a card in (19:01 - 19:06)
that set called fighting dojo right out (19:04 - 19:10)
of the gate it didn't work so instead (19:06 - 19:12)
what direwolf digital did probably (19:10 - 19:15)
because the Pokemon company told them to (19:12 - 19:20)
is they banned the card outside of its (19:15 - 19:24)
so it we've talked about this before but (19:20 - 19:27)
like if you're only practicing in the (19:24 - 19:28)
Pokemon Trading Card Game (19:27 - 19:31)
online to go to tournaments and a card (19:28 - 19:34)
that is brand-new that is vital to the (19:31 - 19:36)
deck that you're probably building is (19:34 - 19:39)
banned you can no longer practice with (19:36 - 19:41)
it and that card is still tournament (19:39 - 19:43)
legal but unless you have real-life (19:41 - 19:46)
people you have no way to practice and (19:43 - 19:49)
it took them I want to say four months (19:46 - 19:52)
to fix fighting dojo and this happening (19:49 - 19:55)
honestly there are other card simulators (19:52 - 19:57)
that you can use you don't have to use P (19:55 - 20:01)
TCG oh it's just that's the official one (19:57 - 20:05)
okay I've looked up dire wolf games (20:01 - 20:08)
mm-hmm I think this is a Pokemon problem (20:05 - 20:13)
I did think it is - I am they are so (20:08 - 20:17)
they have made the tabletop version of (20:13 - 20:22)
clank they are making the online version (20:17 - 20:25)
of route from leader games full (20:22 - 20:28)
disclosure I'm friends with Patrick (20:25 - 20:31)
that's mr. Lindner thank you yes Patrick (20:28 - 20:36)
leader so like I just don't like I think (20:31 - 20:40)
they could do a lot for the TCG if (20:36 - 20:43)
Pokemon (20:40 - 20:45)
gave them money so I'm I'm very curious (20:43 - 20:48)
if when this started before they (20:45 - 20:51)
announced this they were like okay we've (20:48 - 20:54)
let you just have this and we've not (20:51 - 20:55)
given you anything for a long time but (20:54 - 20:58)
we need you to make it a lot better like (20:55 - 21:03)
in a month because they have a lot of (20:58 - 21:08)
games like they have a lot of new games (21:03 - 21:11)
that they are they are putting out and (21:08 - 21:12)
there's a bunch of people that have put (21:11 - 21:14)
like putting their like renegade game (21:12 - 21:18)
studio which is not a small board game (21:14 - 21:22)
company is working with them to me it (21:18 - 21:24)
feels like they have a contract with (21:22 - 21:27)
direwolf and because the Pokemon TCG (21:24 - 21:30)
doesn't actually make the Pokemon (21:27 - 21:33)
company money and here's the other (21:30 - 21:36)
problem with it that it only exists (21:33 - 21:40)
outside of Japan because remember (21:36 - 21:42)
there's no client for Japanese players (21:40 - 21:46)
and we know from past conversations that (21:42 - 21:47)
we've had with people who have worked (21:46 - 21:49)
directly with the Pokemon company that (21:47 - 21:51)
even though the Pokemon headquarters is (21:49 - 21:54)
in Seattle or Redmond or we're in that (21:51 - 21:56)
area they still have to get everything (21:54 - 21:59)
approved by Japan it always just seems (21:56 - 22:01)
like we want to make the TCG better (21:59 - 22:03)
let's ask Japan oh it's not a priority (22:01 - 22:04)
because it doesn't make money it's not (22:03 - 22:06)
Pokemon go it's not Pokemon masters it's (22:04 - 22:09)
not sword and shield it's not the 56 (22:06 - 22:11)
percent revenue that is there plushies (22:09 - 22:12)
that they ship everything cook here (22:11 - 22:16)
which is like two things do you do you (22:12 - 22:19)
put something into the game to make PTC (22:16 - 22:21)
Gio money or do you just like do you (22:19 - 22:23)
just bite the bullet and keep it free (22:21 - 22:25)
but just make it significantly better so (22:23 - 22:27)
more people play your game or just do (22:25 - 22:30)
like just I don't do both just make it (22:27 - 22:31)
better like make it a better game I (22:30 - 22:34)
don't they this this product has been (22:31 - 22:38)
around for eight years it's on Windows (22:34 - 22:40)
it's a Windows app it's a Mac OS F it's (22:38 - 22:44)
on it's on iPad OS and it's on android (22:40 - 22:45)
tablets but of course with anything (22:44 - 22:47)
Android you can side load it (22:45 - 22:51)
there is no iOS app there is no switch (22:47 - 22:54)
app they have never they do have in game (22:51 - 22:55)
tournaments but they're super simple (22:54 - 22:56)
they're like (22:55 - 22:59)
you three opponents whatever that is (22:56 - 23:03)
like quarter semi-finals and you get (22:59 - 23:05)
tickets there's a lot of things that (23:03 - 23:09)
they need to answer / get right so in (23:05 - 23:13)
the press release specifically it says (23:09 - 23:15)
the TCG competitors will qualify for the (23:13 - 23:17)
pokémon trainer clubs through the (23:15 - 23:19)
ranking also just a heads up your (23:17 - 23:20)
ranking has always been hidden you're (23:19 - 23:24)
the elo and TCO is is hidden on the Jun (23:20 - 23:27)
leaderboards standard format in the (23:24 - 23:29)
trading card game and it doesn't really (23:27 - 23:32)
say much else so like currently in the (23:29 - 23:34)
trading card game (23:32 - 23:37)
they have like a ticket system and you (23:34 - 23:39)
can earn tickets and then you cash in (23:37 - 23:40)
those tickets to participate in like (23:39 - 23:42)
those little tournaments I just (23:40 - 23:43)
mentioned but what if you don't have (23:42 - 23:46)
tickets what if you're like what if you (23:43 - 23:48)
are a player that has only played (23:46 - 23:50)
locally and you have like a community (23:48 - 23:54)
that you play TCG oweth but now you want (23:50 - 23:56)
to compete because this is the only way (23:54 - 23:58)
to compete how are you supposed to get (23:56 - 24:01)
cards without like trading other people (23:58 - 24:04)
well you buy packs and then you get the (24:01 - 24:06)
codes and then you you put the codes in (24:04 - 24:09)
that very painful laborious process of (24:06 - 24:12)
entering codes then like hope you get (24:09 - 24:15)
the cards you need or like I mean the (24:12 - 24:18)
realistic thing to do is like you redeem (24:15 - 24:21)
a bunch of codes then instead of opening (24:18 - 24:22)
the packs you trade the packs because (24:21 - 24:24)
the packs are worth more closed than (24:22 - 24:27)
they are open so like right now I just (24:24 - 24:30)
opened up PTC geo so if you want to do a (24:27 - 24:33)
standard match so they allow each each (24:30 - 24:34)
one of these tournaments have eight (24:33 - 24:36)
people obviously I'm assuming this new (24:34 - 24:38)
tournament will be bigger it costs 8 (24:36 - 24:42)
tickets to enter the match your reward (24:38 - 24:44)
is if you come in first place (24:42 - 24:46)
you get you get six pack booster packs (24:44 - 24:49)
you come and you also get four 100 coins (24:46 - 24:51)
which is a different currency they use (24:49 - 24:53)
you can use coins to buy booster packs (24:51 - 24:55)
so 200 coins is a booster pack you come (24:53 - 24:57)
in second place you get two booster (24:55 - 25:00)
packs 100 coins and then if you come in (24:57 - 25:03)
third place you get 100 coins and two (25:00 - 25:04)
booster packs (25:03 - 25:05)
sorry second place gets four booster (25:04 - 25:07)
packs and then if you come fifth through (25:05 - 25:10)
eight you get like 50 coins so 1/4 of a (25:07 - 25:10)
booster (25:10 - 25:13)
I have 76 tickets which I don't know (25:10 - 25:14)
what the bath is that's like ten (25:13 - 25:17)
tournaments there's not a also a (25:14 - 25:19)
reliable way to get sort of like tickets (25:17 - 25:20)
so if I burn through all these tickets (25:19 - 25:22)
that's ten tournaments that I could (25:20 - 25:25)
participate in now and then like how am (25:22 - 25:26)
I getting more tickets are they (25:25 - 25:28)
switching the lot do I have to like play (25:26 - 25:29)
ladder earn tickets then take those (25:28 - 25:31)
tickets to participate in the tournament (25:29 - 25:33)
to get points or is the tournament just (25:31 - 25:36)
opened there's like a lot here that (25:33 - 25:40)
there's a lot of unanswered questions (25:36 - 25:42)
compared to like sword and shield and (25:40 - 25:43)
compared to pokken tournament that's (25:42 - 25:46)
that's happening there is no way to give (25:43 - 25:49)
ptc geo money the you have coins you (25:46 - 25:51)
earn coins by playing matches you can (25:49 - 25:54)
cash in those coins for packs you can go (25:51 - 25:56)
to Target or Walmart and you can buy a (25:54 - 25:58)
pack of cards for four dollars and (25:56 - 25:59)
twenty-nine cents and you can open it (25:58 - 26:01)
and get a digital pack which will have (25:59 - 26:04)
different cards and you could maybe (26:01 - 26:07)
trade those cards in like the trading (26:04 - 26:09)
area but if you've ever been on any (26:07 - 26:12)
online trading area it is nothing but (26:09 - 26:15)
scams or you can go to eBay this is (26:12 - 26:18)
another problem so like it's against P (26:15 - 26:21)
TCG oh it's against the Terms of Service (26:18 - 26:23)
that no one ever reads we talk about (26:21 - 26:24)
this all the time with like Pokemon go (26:23 - 26:25)
how you're only supposed to have one one (26:24 - 26:27)
account and stuff but it is technically (26:25 - 26:29)
against the Terms of Service and Pt cgo (26:27 - 26:32)
to pay physical money for cards so I (26:29 - 26:34)
can't go to will and say will I saw you (26:32 - 26:37)
open up on your stream to full art (26:34 - 26:39)
Reshiram charizard's I don't have any (26:37 - 26:42)
booster packs or anything to put to play (26:39 - 26:44)
and we're not friends in this situation (26:42 - 26:46)
I will give you I will PayPal you $10 to (26:44 - 26:48)
send those cards to me that is against (26:46 - 26:52)
TOS well I am giving you the all right (26:48 - 26:57)
giving up Reggie's art for $10 D 10 (26:52 - 26:59)
bucks is getting you nothing but what's (26:57 - 27:02)
not against TOS is you can technically (26:59 - 27:06)
go to eBay or or like a website look (27:02 - 27:08)
we'll stuffing court rollin tote and you (27:06 - 27:10)
can say I would like a hundred code (27:08 - 27:13)
cards for $80 so I'm paying 80 cents a (27:10 - 27:15)
code card it was like a hundred code (27:13 - 27:17)
cards and then they mail it to you or (27:15 - 27:19)
they email it to you and then you enter (27:17 - 27:21)
them into the game and technically (27:19 - 27:23)
that's not against TOS because you're (27:21 - 27:24)
not buying an (27:23 - 27:26)
item that already exists in the game (27:24 - 27:28)
because you have not entered that item (27:26 - 27:30)
into the game but once you get the items (27:28 - 27:31)
then you entered in the game and then (27:30 - 27:33)
that's okay but there's like there's (27:31 - 27:36)
literally not a way and maybe because it (27:33 - 27:38)
ruins the marketplace for me to just say (27:36 - 27:41)
like hey P TCG oh can I just buy a (27:38 - 27:43)
hundred packs for real money so I can (27:41 - 27:45)
open these packs and build decks there's (27:43 - 27:48)
not you have to buy either code cards or (27:45 - 27:50)
you have to buy and the only people (27:48 - 27:52)
winning from the code cards I'd like the (27:50 - 27:53)
sellers right it's like when games (27:52 - 27:55)
upsells use games it's not like Nintendo (27:53 - 27:57)
sees a copy it when game stop sells a (27:55 - 28:01)
copy a heart all used copy of heartgold (27:57 - 28:03)
SoulSilver so like somebody at a card (28:01 - 28:05)
shop is opening a hundred packs they're (28:03 - 28:07)
selling the cards individually and then (28:05 - 28:08)
they're selling the code cards so (28:07 - 28:09)
they're like kind of double dipping (28:08 - 28:11)
which is like fine I don't have a (28:09 - 28:13)
problem with that but like I want to (28:11 - 28:15)
give you my like let me give you my (28:13 - 28:17)
money to make PTC geo better because I (28:15 - 28:19)
want to play more PTC Gio and it is a (28:17 - 28:22)
bad application it's just not great yeah (28:19 - 28:24)
it's it's all about this like bizarrely (28:22 - 28:27)
contrived secondary market that they (28:24 - 28:29)
don't even want to acknowledge exists (28:27 - 28:32)
and yet they continue to fuel right like (28:29 - 28:36)
they hey like in Pokemon masters they (28:32 - 28:38)
have it where you can you can't spend a (28:36 - 28:39)
certain amount of money is that about (28:38 - 28:41)
right Greg like like you can only spend (28:39 - 28:44)
whatever 200 only 200 dollars a month or (28:41 - 28:45)
something and Pokemon masters cuz it (28:44 - 28:46)
yells at you that you spent too much (28:45 - 28:50)
money yeah there's a cap if they're if (28:46 - 28:52)
they're worried about that I don't do it (28:50 - 28:56)
like they already like pry it like PTC (28:52 - 28:59)
geo is older significantly older than (28:56 - 29:01)
Pokemon go and significantly older than (28:59 - 29:03)
masters and they have tons of children (29:01 - 29:06)
that is way easier in my opinion to (29:03 - 29:10)
spend money in the app store and buy (29:06 - 29:12)
coins for Pokemon go or buy gems for (29:10 - 29:14)
Pokemon masters and I guess they would (29:12 - 29:16)
have to build a back-end to accept money (29:14 - 29:18)
and then they would have to handle (29:16 - 29:20)
refunds if you know little Timmy grabbed (29:18 - 29:22)
mom's credit card punched it in bought a (29:20 - 29:24)
thousand coins or whatever (29:22 - 29:26)
I heard Squarespace could set me up with (29:24 - 29:30)
a payment portal they're worried about (29:26 - 29:33)
but are they still stuck in this mindset (29:30 - 29:35)
of we're scared to take my truck (29:33 - 29:36)
microtransactions you're already doing (29:35 - 29:38)
it in two extreme (29:36 - 29:42)
we popular games even if PT she geo was (29:38 - 29:46)
slightly more expensive than eBay so I (29:42 - 29:48)
and that always depends right like (29:46 - 29:49)
sometimes the code is 80 cents some (29:48 - 29:51)
kinds that sometimes the code is like a (29:49 - 29:55)
dollar 25 but that's still way cheaper (29:51 - 29:58)
than paying 4 bucks and then getting (29:55 - 30:00)
really bad pulls and yeah and being like (29:58 - 30:02)
I'm not I don't I don't I'm sick of (30:00 - 30:03)
these physical cards I just want to play (30:02 - 30:06)
in PT cgo cuz that's because I can get a (30:03 - 30:08)
game at any point I don't know even if (30:06 - 30:09)
it was like 2 bucks to get a digital (30:08 - 30:13)
booster pack in PT cg.o I would almost (30:09 - 30:16)
just do that just for the pure sake of (30:13 - 30:18)
convenience it's really kind of annoying (30:16 - 30:19)
to like order 100 codes off eBay and (30:18 - 30:21)
then just copy and paste 100 codes in (30:19 - 30:24)
like it's easy boring and it makes me (30:21 - 30:27)
feel like an accountant I'll pay for (30:24 - 30:29)
convenience and I would rather give my (30:27 - 30:31)
money to PT cgo so PTC joke becomes (30:29 - 30:33)
better than to give it to some dude on (30:31 - 30:36)
ebay who no offense to them he delivers (30:33 - 30:38)
the codes pretty quickly but I got no (30:36 - 30:40)
relationship with that guy like I do (30:38 - 30:43)
with with an actual Pokemon product I am (30:40 - 30:46)
very curious of how this is going to (30:43 - 30:49)
work and hopefully this makes PTC Gio (30:46 - 30:51)
better but man if it takes some four (30:49 - 30:54)
months to fix a card I don't know what (30:51 - 31:00)
they're gonna do in the next 14 days (30:54 - 31:00)
it's it's just gonna be a very ptc Gio (31:02 - 31:10)
oriented tournament and you know you're (31:06 - 31:11)
just gonna have to shift your meta for (31:10 - 31:13)
what that can accommodate and because (31:11 - 31:15)
it's like an official tournament - that (31:13 - 31:18)
is does that even introduce a huge new (31:15 - 31:21)
loophole of cheating or something like (31:18 - 31:22)
oh yeah especially for all the Android (31:21 - 31:25)
people that have like hacked I mean this (31:22 - 31:28)
was like a huge problem in Vanguard zero (31:25 - 31:29)
right that that games been out for what (31:28 - 31:32)
a month and a half and people have (31:29 - 31:35)
already but I mean let me not despair at (31:32 - 31:37)
Android users but obviously you can only (31:35 - 31:38)
do it on Android but people have already (31:37 - 31:43)
hacked it to get Auto wins yeah (31:38 - 31:45)
just like once you there's I mean that (31:43 - 31:47)
actually there's not even anything to (31:45 - 31:50)
gain from playing Bankart zero so now (31:47 - 31:51)
it's gonna be even worse because when (31:50 - 31:53)
there is something to gain then people (31:51 - 31:55)
are gonna have more incentive to hack (31:53 - 32:03)
the game or yeah like I would love to be (31:55 - 32:05)
I would love to like sit down with (32:03 - 32:07)
somebody who who said okay we're about (32:05 - 32:10)
to do a tournament P tzgo and like look (32:07 - 32:12)
at that person and say what (32:10 - 32:17)
walk me through person who is decided to (32:12 - 32:19)
do this tournament and for the record (32:17 - 32:21)
I'm it's very cool that they're doing a (32:19 - 32:25)
tournament but to sit down and say okay (32:21 - 32:28)
how do you expect a player to get enough (32:25 - 32:30)
cards and to build a deck for this (32:28 - 32:31)
tournament what does that look like to (32:30 - 32:34)
you like what is your what is the the (32:31 - 32:37)
customer path are you recommending like (32:34 - 32:39)
they need to go to Target and buy a (32:37 - 32:41)
bunch of packs are you recommending that (32:39 - 32:43)
like they should get an ET be open the (32:41 - 32:46)
packs not or claim the digital packs and (32:43 - 32:47)
not open the packs and trade them on the (32:46 - 32:50)
marketplace what do you want your (32:47 - 32:51)
customer to do at this point because (32:50 - 32:53)
it's not like you always we're doing (32:51 - 32:55)
tournaments it's not like this is brand (32:53 - 32:57)
new this is this is a tournament to (32:55 - 33:00)
qualify or the players Cup which me no (32:57 - 33:02)
for more or less maybe not as important (33:00 - 33:04)
as an actual championship but because of (33:02 - 33:07)
how weird this year is it is you know (33:04 - 33:08)
the substitute for an actual (33:07 - 33:11)
championship like what is what is the (33:08 - 33:14)
workflow you expect so I would say in (33:11 - 33:18)
their defense the one thing that kind of (33:14 - 33:21)
probably if I was imagining myself being (33:18 - 33:24)
in that decision-making room is they (33:21 - 33:26)
basically said you know we want to hold (33:24 - 33:28)
a tournament what do we have available (33:26 - 33:31)
well that's what we have right rather (33:28 - 33:33)
than having no tournament at all let's (33:31 - 33:35)
have a tournament with what we have and (33:33 - 33:38)
we know it's not the best but you know (33:35 - 33:42)
it's better than nothing so let's go (33:38 - 33:44)
forward with that it's just the amount (33:42 - 33:46)
of barriers with starting off in PTC (33:44 - 33:49)
Gio's is it's very high well I don't (33:46 - 33:50)
think they're expecting anybody to come (33:49 - 33:53)
from zero for this you dumped a bunch of (33:50 - 33:56)
money and to eBay codes or just go to (33:53 - 33:56)
Tower (33:56 - 33:58)
clean house and hope you get good poles (33:56 - 34:00)
well I mean the real secret is to become (33:58 - 34:02)
a successful twitch streamer and then (34:00 - 34:04)
people just give you codes and trade you (34:02 - 34:05)
yards because they're like I just want (34:04 - 34:08)
to be part of that person your success (34:05 - 34:12)
like you so the TCG tournament (34:08 - 34:16)
it starts in June or July the TCG (34:12 - 34:19)
tournament starts in June and you have (34:16 - 34:22)
to get enough rank by doing the little (34:19 - 34:25)
tournaments that cost tickets which we (34:22 - 34:27)
don't know how to get tickets yet I mean (34:25 - 34:29)
I got one ticket for logging into PTC (34:27 - 34:31)
geo four days in a row I got one ticket (34:29 - 34:33)
mostly these tournaments cost eight (34:31 - 34:36)
tickets to enter so you have to use (34:33 - 34:39)
tickets this is as far as we know unless (34:36 - 34:40)
they change it or unless I misunderstood (34:39 - 34:42)
you have to use tickets to participate (34:40 - 34:43)
in these tournaments you win the (34:42 - 34:44)
tournaments they give you a higher elo (34:43 - 34:47)
they pick the top 256 elo from (34:44 - 34:50)
respective regions and then they move on (34:47 - 34:52)
to the final thing which would be in (34:50 - 34:56)
August or whatever or July they said (34:52 - 34:59)
double elimination bracket so what is (34:56 - 35:01)
the double elimination you lose twice in (34:59 - 35:04)
your app yeah it's not single (35:01 - 35:07)
elimination and there and we're just (35:04 - 35:11)
learning about this and the 14th of May (35:07 - 35:13)
yes and they said that this is gonna (35:11 - 35:16)
start in June and they're releasing an (35:13 - 35:19)
expansion in June and there's probably (35:16 - 35:22)
an overlap of people who are excited for (35:19 - 35:24)
sword and shield DLC and people who (35:22 - 35:27)
liked the Pokemon Trading Card Game I (35:24 - 35:34)
don't expect the entire the entire (35:27 - 35:36)
tournament to last the entire month of (35:34 - 35:40)
June it's just extraordinary times so (35:36 - 35:42)
you have to you know think outside the (35:40 - 35:45)
bun yeah none of this is like I'm very (35:42 - 35:46)
happy they're doing all of this it's (35:45 - 35:50)
just very fast yeah it seems like a very (35:46 - 35:52)
short turnaround time for everybody (35:50 - 35:53)
involved (35:52 - 35:57)
I'm just I feel like when June starts (35:53 - 36:00)
there's gonna be like here's our new way (35:57 - 36:02)
of getting cards so you can rebuild your (36:00 - 36:05)
decks or something like something (36:02 - 36:06)
because (36:05 - 36:08)
have to know that that's a problem or (36:06 - 36:11)
are they just are they just feel like (36:08 - 36:13)
nope everybody's starting over from (36:11 - 36:15)
scratch make what you make what you can (36:13 - 36:19)
get anything that is uh it's like (36:15 - 36:21)
slightly before team up (36:19 - 36:25)
it's like legal and then I mean the the (36:21 - 36:27)
the nice here's the the nicest thing (36:25 - 36:29)
about PTC geo is as long as the card (36:27 - 36:31)
isn't physically digitally broken in the (36:29 - 36:34)
game again this is this is against Terms (36:31 - 36:36)
of Service but if you were to go to ebay (36:34 - 36:39)
you could buy a digital Jirachi for $15 (36:36 - 36:42)
and then somebody will add your ptc geo (36:39 - 36:44)
name and send it to you I'm not advising (36:42 - 36:47)
anyone to do that but that's how much (36:44 - 36:48)
Jirachi is worth about digital Jirachi (36:47 - 36:51)
is worth about 15 bucks and so you need (36:48 - 36:53)
like 3 2 to 3 Jirachi x' in a deck so (36:51 - 36:57)
that's $45 just to be at a competitive (36:53 - 36:59)
level as everyone else talk about (36:57 - 37:01)
barriers to have competitive but they (36:59 - 37:04)
are releasing I believe near the end of (37:01 - 37:06)
this month they're releasing to battle (37:04 - 37:10)
boxes and these battle boxes one of them (37:06 - 37:16)
comes with Jirachi physical but the code (37:10 - 37:18)
card in the battle box will match all (37:16 - 37:21)
the cards in the deck and I believe one (37:18 - 37:24)
is a zekrom Zekrom pikachu Tag Team deck (37:21 - 37:25)
and one is a restaurant Charizard (37:24 - 37:28)
Pikachu Dec or sorry Russia just Russia (37:25 - 37:30)
rim charges are no Pikachu Russia Ram (37:28 - 37:32)
Charizard and then Zekrom Pikachu and (37:30 - 37:36)
they both have complete decks so I think (37:32 - 37:40)
each one is like $25 and they come with (37:36 - 37:42)
all the good cards all those good cards (37:40 - 37:44)
or tournament legal and the code card (37:42 - 37:47)
should give you the same deck in the (37:44 - 37:51)
game and so that actually helps with (37:47 - 37:52)
some of the issue of like oh I need (37:51 - 37:54)
Jirachi is in order to play but that (37:52 - 37:56)
still doesn't (37:54 - 37:58)
maybe that maybe that's actually the (37:56 - 37:59)
go-to maybe they're like you know what (37:58 - 38:00)
you know if you've never played the (37:59 - 38:02)
Pokemon Trading Card Game and you need (38:00 - 38:03)
some cards (38:02 - 38:06)
we suggest our customers buy this battle (38:03 - 38:08)
box which will probably sell out I'm (38:06 - 38:11)
sure and we would suggest them for them (38:08 - 38:13)
to buy some digit weeks suggest for them (38:11 - 38:15)
to buy the battle box at Target and we (38:13 - 38:18)
suggest for them to buy an e TB or some (38:15 - 38:19)
booster packs and then they have the (38:18 - 38:21)
framework of a deck two really good (38:19 - 38:24)
decks and we would suggest them to trade (38:21 - 38:25)
for the other cards are missing just (38:24 - 38:27)
like in real life maybe that's actually (38:25 - 38:29)
the the thought process but if you're (38:27 - 38:30)
not keeping tabs on this if you're not (38:29 - 38:32)
listening to this podcast we're going to (38:30 - 38:34)
TCG websites you probably would have no (38:32 - 38:36)
clue that this battle box is coming and (38:34 - 38:39)
I think it comes out on the 23rd I maybe (38:36 - 38:42)
maybe that maybe that's the plan I mean (38:39 - 38:43)
it doesn't answer the actual how the (38:42 - 38:47)
tournaments gonna run but it's a whole (38:43 - 38:49)
new world we live in (38:47 - 38:53)
oh there you go too long didn't read I (38:49 - 38:56)
really want PT cgo to be better and I (38:53 - 38:59)
hope maybe this is the first step (38:56 - 39:02)
towards that future I were total izing (38:59 - 39:08)
that dream that that this pivot is the (39:02 - 39:11)
start of the Pokemon company really (39:08 - 39:14)
giving direwolf digital the benefit of (39:11 - 39:18)
the doubt to make PTC geo better yes (39:14 - 39:22)
okay when we come back it'll be the (39:18 - 39:24)
interview with Aaron he's (39:22 - 39:26)
his thoughts on the current meta of the (39:24 - 39:29)
sword and shield TC VGC how to get into (39:26 - 39:31)
it his thoughts on it compared to past (39:29 - 39:35)
meadows and all that stuff so we'll be (39:31 - 39:36)
right back (39:35 - 40:22)
[Music] (39:36 - 40:22)
[Music] (40:30 - 40:40)

cybertron VGC how are you Aaron I'm good (40:43 - 40:50)
thank you for having me here thank you (40:48 - 40:51)
for being on this has been like a like a (40:50 - 40:54)
five-year endeavor to get you on the (40:51 - 40:57)
ship long overdue man (40:54 - 40:59)
yeah well I'm excited that you're here (40:57 - 41:02)
if somebody doesn't know who you are (40:59 - 41:05)
real quick or however long you want but (41:02 - 41:05)
what do you do (41:05 - 41:09)
who are you my name is Aaron Zayn but I (41:05 - 41:11)
go by Cybertron and I am a competitive (41:09 - 41:14)
VGC player commentator and content (41:11 - 41:16)
creator so I've been playing VGC since (41:14 - 41:20)
2008 actually and throughout my years of (41:16 - 41:21)
competing I've won five regional (41:20 - 41:23)
championships two national championships (41:21 - 41:24)
and third at the World Championships in (41:23 - 41:26)
2013 and in more recent years I've (41:24 - 41:28)
transitioned over to becoming a (41:26 - 41:29)
commentator for the Pokemon company so (41:28 - 41:31)
if you've ever watched the International (41:29 - 41:33)
Championship or World Championship (41:31 - 41:34)
streams I've commented in many of those (41:33 - 41:36)
events including the World Finals in (41:34 - 41:41)
2016 2018 and 2019 and I also have a (41:36 - 41:43)
youtube channel that passed 100,000 (41:41 - 41:44)
subscribers with sword and shield coming (41:43 - 41:46)
out so I mean content there every day (41:44 - 41:48)
trying to educate people and help them (41:46 - 41:49)
improve in the game you went through the (41:48 - 41:51)
whole College thing I know because that (41:49 - 41:53)
was like a lot of up and down with your (41:51 - 41:56)
YouTube of like schools now YouTube's on (41:53 - 41:58)
hold but have you transitioned to (41:56 - 42:01)
casting slash playing competitive full (41:58 - 42:02)
time or do you have like a nine-to-five (42:01 - 42:05)
job that you keep secret yeah I'm (42:02 - 42:06)
actually finishing up my last semester (42:05 - 42:08)
of school so I did five years of (42:06 - 42:10)
undergrad to get two different bachelor (42:08 - 42:11)
degrees from two different schools and I (42:10 - 42:13)
mean literally the last week of my (42:11 - 42:15)
program my final exam is on Wednesday (42:13 - 42:17)
and then officially graduating and I (42:15 - 42:20)
think a week and a half so after that (42:17 - 42:21)
I'm actually gonna be working full time (42:20 - 42:23)
and I'm not gonna be doing content stuff (42:21 - 42:24)
but I'll actually be working in gaming (42:23 - 42:27)
and eSports working for an investment (42:24 - 42:29)
group called axiomatic and they actually (42:27 - 42:31)
are most known for owning Team Liquid (42:29 - 42:32)
which is one of the premier eSports team (42:31 - 42:35)
so out there we'll be doing a lot of (42:32 - 42:36)
investing in different companies like (42:35 - 42:38)
Team Liquid as well as strategy work for (42:36 - 42:40)
the companies that were invested in so (42:38 - 42:42)
I'm really excited about that mainly (42:40 - 42:43)
because it's just a mix of (42:42 - 42:45)
you know taking my passion for gaming (42:43 - 42:46)
but also taking everything that I've (42:45 - 42:48)
learned from school in my previous you (42:46 - 42:49)
know internship and job experiences and (42:48 - 42:51)
really combining you know also I still (42:49 - 42:53)
be will be doing Pokemon stuff but I (42:51 - 42:55)
always like doing you know like (42:53 - 42:57)
commentating and playing more as like a (42:55 - 42:59)
sight thing rather than as a full-time (42:57 - 43:03)
career sure things I don't blame you (42:59 - 43:06)
consecrating is a very competitive yeah (43:03 - 43:09)
absolutely being of competitive VGC and (43:06 - 43:11)
sword and shield it was a pretty big (43:09 - 43:15)
deal I think no one would argue that the (43:11 - 43:17)
VG season was going incredibly well (43:15 - 43:19)
until the pandemic happened but how do (43:17 - 43:21)
you feel about the VGC specifically in (43:19 - 43:24)
sword and shield it's been amazing I (43:21 - 43:27)
think we saw so many great things that (43:24 - 43:28)
came out of sword and shield I think the (43:27 - 43:31)
main thing is like the quality of life (43:28 - 43:32)
changes have just made it so much easier (43:31 - 43:34)
for players to get into the game so for (43:32 - 43:36)
example rental teams are super (43:34 - 43:38)
accessible so now it's very easy for (43:36 - 43:40)
anyone to just try out and play with any (43:38 - 43:41)
team that they might be interested in (43:40 - 43:44)
what's published online in addition it's (43:41 - 43:46)
a lot easier to get competitive Pokemon (43:44 - 43:48)
in-game now through the combination of (43:46 - 43:50)
like nature or mints I should say it's a (43:48 - 43:53)
lot easier to breed as well so I just (43:50 - 43:54)
everything makes it more accessible and (43:53 - 43:56)
I think that was kind of the biggest (43:54 - 43:57)
barrier ten trees for people that were (43:56 - 43:59)
interested in getting into the game and (43:57 - 44:02)
yeah I think overall this format seemed (43:59 - 44:04)
to be very fun for a lot of people as (44:02 - 44:06)
well meet myself included it's the most (44:04 - 44:07)
fun I've had playing VGC in a couple of (44:06 - 44:09)
years and I think because there are so (44:07 - 44:11)
many you know Pokemon that are very (44:09 - 44:12)
viable and strong so many different (44:11 - 44:15)
strategies that could work this year was (44:12 - 44:16)
really shaping up to be one of the best (44:15 - 44:19)
years of VGC so obviously it's a shame (44:16 - 44:20)
like the rest of the season is canceled (44:19 - 44:22)
but you know that was really the only (44:20 - 44:24)
correct move to make and we're still (44:22 - 44:26)
seeing people play a ton of BGC online (44:24 - 44:27)
there's been a lot of grassroots efforts (44:26 - 44:30)
to keep the scene alive so I think it's (44:27 - 44:32)
a very very we have a very very bright (44:30 - 44:34)
future and I feel like sword and shield (44:32 - 44:35)
introduced so much light (44:34 - 44:38)
made it have so much potential one of (44:35 - 44:40)
the main reasons we brought you on was (44:38 - 44:42)
to kind of dig a little bit deeper in (44:40 - 44:44)
VGC and whatnot because you have a (44:42 - 44:46)
really good oversight of it but before (44:44 - 44:48)
we get to that how do you feel about (44:46 - 44:51)
sword and shield as a whole we talked (44:48 - 44:53)
about sales numbers last weeks and it (44:51 - 44:56)
you know it's sold 17 million copies and (44:53 - 44:56)
that's (44:56 - 44:58)
on top of you know there was a lot of (44:56 - 45:01)
bad press when it would was a fish (44:58 - 45:04)
officially announced so yeah that didn't (45:01 - 45:06)
seem to you know the whole boycott sort (45:04 - 45:08)
and she'll didn't really seem to pan out (45:06 - 45:11)
with 17 million copies being sold but (45:08 - 45:13)
how do you feel about it personally yeah (45:11 - 45:15)
that's a great question I've always been (45:13 - 45:17)
a competitive player first but you know (45:15 - 45:18)
I still enjoy pointing the games just (45:17 - 45:20)
like casually just to run through them (45:18 - 45:22)
and I enjoyed sword and shield a lot (45:20 - 45:24)
more I would say than for something like (45:22 - 45:26)
ultra saw no moon which was probably my (45:24 - 45:28)
least favorite game of all time mainly (45:26 - 45:29)
because of how similar was the Sun and (45:28 - 45:32)
Moon but Sun and Moon I also like I felt (45:29 - 45:34)
like I didn't like it super much I (45:32 - 45:36)
wasn't I was more indifferent about it I (45:34 - 45:37)
guess but sorting showed I actually (45:36 - 45:40)
really enjoyed for example raids I had a (45:37 - 45:41)
ton of fun doing with a lot of my (45:40 - 45:42)
friends I thought it was a great way to (45:41 - 45:45)
interact with the community and like one (45:42 - 45:46)
of my favorite thing about raids is that (45:45 - 45:47)
like it's great for competitive players (45:46 - 45:49)
but I have a lot of like friends who (45:47 - 45:50)
play Pokemon casually they're not really (45:49 - 45:52)
interested in competitive but they were (45:50 - 45:54)
still interested in doing braids just to (45:52 - 45:56)
get some cool Pokemon or you know some (45:54 - 45:58)
items so raids I thought were really (45:56 - 45:59)
cool I liked the in-game experience a (45:58 - 46:02)
lot I thought the wild area was super (45:59 - 46:03)
exciting as well so I definitely had fun (46:02 - 46:06)
playing the in-game and I think being (46:03 - 46:07)
able to customize your character (46:06 - 46:08)
actually was one thing that I missed a (46:07 - 46:10)
lot so to see that return I think was (46:08 - 46:12)
also super awesome and at the end of the (46:10 - 46:15)
day the experience was super fun and I (46:12 - 46:17)
even did it you know didn't mind doing (46:15 - 46:20)
stuff like grinding to get competitive (46:17 - 46:21)
Pokemon or whatnot whereas it might've (46:20 - 46:22)
been a little bit more frustrating in (46:21 - 46:24)
previous games so for me I enjoyed it (46:22 - 46:26)
mainly because of like raids and just (46:24 - 46:27)
the interaction I was able to have with (46:26 - 46:29)
friends who maybe played more casually (46:27 - 46:31)
you bringing up raids that brings up one (46:29 - 46:33)
of the biggest mechanics of a sword and (46:31 - 46:35)
shield which makes it different than (46:33 - 46:39)
competitive you know in Sun and Moon or (46:35 - 46:40)
X&Y or whatnot but (46:39 - 46:43)
Dynomax Pokemon Giganta max Pokemon that (46:40 - 46:46)
is a you know in in the competitive (46:43 - 46:48)
sense the Pokemon company loves doubt (46:46 - 46:51)
doubles they have never really supported (46:48 - 46:54)
singles and so you see you know great of (46:51 - 46:56)
what you said earlier like you see you (46:54 - 46:58)
know non-official stuff like smoke on (46:56 - 47:00)
you know they went the extreme to ban (46:58 - 47:03)
Dynomax and you know before that was a (47:00 - 47:05)
huge thing I heard before people even (47:03 - 47:07)
got their hands on the game or you know (47:05 - 47:11)
big Pokemon are dumb and we want Megas (47:07 - 47:13)
we want Z moves back this is a loaded (47:11 - 47:15)
question but let's wait how do you feel (47:13 - 47:17)
about Dynomax as a mechanic (47:15 - 47:19)
competitively yeah since I only played (47:17 - 47:22)
VGC exclusively my experience with that (47:19 - 47:25)
is only really envy GC and I am a pretty (47:22 - 47:28)
big fan of it in BGC I think it is very (47:25 - 47:32)
dynamic it has a lot to lagaye and I do (47:28 - 47:33)
think there are some things that could (47:32 - 47:35)
have been like fine-tuned about it for (47:33 - 47:37)
example I think it would have been a lot (47:35 - 47:38)
more interesting of a mechanic or I (47:37 - 47:40)
guess it's not interesting but if you (47:38 - 47:42)
like decrease the power creep by making (47:40 - 47:44)
an item like life orb not viable on (47:42 - 47:46)
Dynomax mom's weakness policy it's part (47:44 - 47:47)
of the reason why Dynomax is so (47:46 - 47:49)
threatening in BGC there's so many (47:47 - 47:51)
setups with weakness policy but in (47:49 - 47:55)
general I do think it is a good mechanic (47:51 - 47:56)
and I've enjoyed playing with it a lot (47:55 - 47:58)
and I think one thing that makes it fun (47:56 - 48:00)
- is that like seeing really good (47:58 - 48:02)
players and how they use Dynomax is (48:00 - 48:05)
super interesting if you look at like (48:02 - 48:07)
the top format replays from a lot of the (48:05 - 48:08)
tournaments we had before all this stuff (48:07 - 48:10)
started happening like you would often (48:08 - 48:12)
see six different pokemon Dynomax (48:10 - 48:14)
throughout the course of a best-of-three (48:12 - 48:15)
you know someone just chooses a (48:14 - 48:16)
different pokemon and dynamics in every (48:15 - 48:19)
game so I like that it makes like every (48:16 - 48:22)
pokemon somewhat viable um I don't think (48:19 - 48:24)
it's the perfect mechanic but I (48:22 - 48:25)
personally enjoyed playing with it that (48:24 - 48:27)
being said I do think that it feels like (48:25 - 48:29)
it was kind of made for doubles whereas (48:27 - 48:31)
I can see why players weren't very happy (48:29 - 48:35)
about it in single battles yes sir do (48:31 - 48:36)
you think do you think Pokemon would (48:35 - 48:38)
just be a better game if they didn't (48:36 - 48:40)
have a gimmick like Dynomax or megazor z (48:38 - 48:42)
moves or do you think that like pretty (48:40 - 48:46)
much this is needed yeah I think you (48:42 - 48:49)
know part of the thing that makes them (48:46 - 48:50)
able to market their games with each new (48:49 - 48:52)
generation is the introduction of (48:50 - 48:55)
something crazy right so having Dynomax (48:52 - 48:59)
as a advertising tool I think is one a (48:55 - 49:02)
smart idea so it's interesting because (48:59 - 49:03)
you know having thought about this (49:02 - 49:05)
before it's like for competitive players (49:03 - 49:06)
if you pulled them a lot of them (49:05 - 49:08)
probably wouldn't mind a meta game for (49:06 - 49:10)
example without Dynomax but from the (49:08 - 49:11)
company's perspective I think it adds a (49:10 - 49:13)
lot of value to have a crazy mechanic (49:11 - 49:15)
like this with each generation and it (49:13 - 49:16)
just adds a lot of value when you say (49:15 - 49:19)
market your game I think like for me (49:16 - 49:21)
personally I'd be fine playing (49:19 - 49:23)
competitively with or without dynamics (49:21 - 49:24)
but from the company's perspective I (49:23 - 49:26)
why they introduce one of these (49:24 - 49:28)
mechanics every generation and I've (49:26 - 49:30)
honestly enjoyed dynamics more Lindsey (49:28 - 49:33)
moves and Megas so I have no (49:30 - 49:34)
opposition's (49:33 - 49:37)
yeah I think now maybe if people weren't (49:34 - 49:39)
paying attention closely like you know (49:37 - 49:40)
the Pokemon company has been (49:39 - 49:43)
consistently consistent about removing (49:40 - 49:46)
features and always introducing new (49:43 - 49:49)
features do you think that like well I (49:46 - 49:50)
guess you said you like this better than (49:49 - 49:53)
Z moves or mega Pokemon but was that (49:50 - 49:54)
specifically like a reason you didn't (49:53 - 49:56)
like Sun and Moon was because of the Z (49:54 - 49:59)
move format and mega Pokemon like a (49:56 - 50:01)
thing that really drew you into like the (49:59 - 50:04)
X&Y format yeah I think for me as a (50:01 - 50:06)
competitive player always basically play (50:04 - 50:08)
whatever R is put in front of me so I (50:06 - 50:10)
don't think I was strongly opposed to Z (50:08 - 50:12)
mousse or omegas but for example I (50:10 - 50:15)
didn't like Megas as much as Dynomax (50:12 - 50:16)
because with Megas there were only a (50:15 - 50:18)
couple that were like super viable and (50:16 - 50:19)
like they were just way above the pool (50:18 - 50:21)
for the rest the Pokemon it felt like (50:19 - 50:23)
there wasn't great balance so for (50:21 - 50:25)
example like Salomon's chars or (50:23 - 50:28)
Kangaskhan Gengar Mawile they were just (50:25 - 50:29)
kind of on another tier and then you (50:28 - 50:30)
would so many ones that were like kind (50:29 - 50:32)
of cool but just never really saw any (50:30 - 50:35)
use and for Z moves I think the moves (50:32 - 50:36)
were just staring because like you could (50:35 - 50:38)
have something that's super strong for (50:36 - 50:40)
example like curtana (50:38 - 50:41)
and Landers with all these like super (50:40 - 50:43)
strong legendary Pokemon with the Z move (50:41 - 50:44)
they could just like you know get this (50:43 - 50:47)
really really strong one-hit ko and I (50:44 - 50:48)
don't play around those options were (50:47 - 50:50)
scary but part of what I liked Dynomax (50:48 - 50:52)
is because it makes things bulkier and (50:50 - 50:54)
so I kind of like playing out formats (50:52 - 50:55)
that are a little bit more slow and (50:54 - 50:57)
drawn out and Dynomax works both ways (50:55 - 51:00)
you can you know very easily snowball (50:57 - 51:02)
games with it as well but I like that (51:00 - 51:03)
you can turn any pokemon and make it (51:02 - 51:05)
significantly bulkier basically just by (51:03 - 51:08)
Dino maxing it so I didn't like I guess (51:05 - 51:10)
per se disliked megazor Z was but I just (51:08 - 51:12)
enjoy playing with Dynomax I think a (51:10 - 51:15)
little bit more but those mechanics (51:12 - 51:16)
didn't really I think effect like (51:15 - 51:17)
whether I liked the game or the in-game (51:16 - 51:19)
experience it was more just about like (51:17 - 51:21)
competitive battles would you want like (51:19 - 51:23)
a black and white format back where (51:21 - 51:25)
everyone's running different gems well (51:23 - 51:27)
that was the big mechanic right in black (51:25 - 51:29)
and white it was yeah right yeah I (51:27 - 51:32)
wouldn't be opposed honestly like I I (51:29 - 51:35)
think if I could pick an ideal format (51:32 - 51:37)
played any non Dynomax games like in (51:35 - 51:38)
this generation (51:37 - 51:40)
but I feel like this generation has a (51:38 - 51:42)
lot of potential because there's so many (51:40 - 51:44)
equal pokemon in the pokédex so a lot of (51:42 - 51:45)
top players actually recently been (51:44 - 51:47)
saying yeah if we didn't have Dynomax in (51:45 - 51:48)
this format it would've been like the (51:47 - 51:50)
perfect format and at the end of the day (51:48 - 51:52)
you know people's opinions on formats (51:50 - 51:55)
are super super subjective but yeah I (51:52 - 51:57)
think I wouldn't mind seeing gents come (51:55 - 51:59)
back at the end of the day I'll just (51:57 - 52:00)
play what I'm giving but Dynomax I think (51:59 - 52:04)
I've enjoyed the most next to the very (52:00 - 52:07)
very old Gen 5 formats with gems in 2012 (52:04 - 52:10)
and 13 so to bring up like the current (52:07 - 52:12)
format a lot of that is specifically (52:10 - 52:15)
because there's not 900 some Pokemon (52:12 - 52:18)
there's only 400 so this is like a huge (52:15 - 52:20)
national next thing right I'm sorry I (52:18 - 52:21)
have to bring up national dex because (52:20 - 52:24)
it's sorta chilled so like Masuda stood (52:21 - 52:27)
on stage during the e3 announcement and (52:24 - 52:28)
they said you know two of the reasons (52:27 - 52:30)
why we're cutting Pokemon one is for (52:28 - 52:33)
animations and people can argue whether (52:30 - 52:35)
the tailwhip animation is the same or (52:33 - 52:37)
the hyperbeam animation is new which i (52:35 - 52:39)
think it is but the other reason they (52:37 - 52:40)
said the more important reason at least (52:39 - 52:42)
why for you is they said we're cutting (52:40 - 52:45)
Pokemon to make competitive better and a (52:42 - 52:47)
lot of people thought that was a lie (52:45 - 52:50)
because you know they saw you know they (52:47 - 52:52)
didn't play the game yet but do you (52:50 - 52:54)
think that cutting Pokemon made (52:52 - 52:56)
competitive better yeah it's interesting (52:54 - 52:59)
right because it's like in whoever makes (52:56 - 53:01)
the ruleset has the power theoretically (52:59 - 53:03)
to just like create an arbitrary band (53:01 - 53:06)
list but I will say let all the Pokemon (53:03 - 53:07)
that we ended up with I didn't create it (53:06 - 53:09)
for a really really healthy format a (53:07 - 53:14)
meta game and I think lat I am a little (53:09 - 53:16)
bit scared of what the future meta games (53:14 - 53:17)
are gonna entail up especially because (53:16 - 53:20)
we know for example like you know the (53:17 - 53:22)
legendaries are gonna come back into the (53:20 - 53:25)
game so for me this year was just so so (53:22 - 53:27)
good and I this kind of speaks to like (53:25 - 53:29)
accessibility of the game but I think (53:27 - 53:30)
one reason that people have always been (53:29 - 53:32)
kind of hesitant to watch BGC or play (53:30 - 53:34)
BGC is because a lot of the public's (53:32 - 53:35)
perception is that everyone just uses (53:34 - 53:37)
the same like legendary Pokemon and (53:35 - 53:39)
using strategies and for anyone that I (53:37 - 53:41)
keep the follows VGC you'll know that (53:39 - 53:42)
even if you have two people using like (53:41 - 53:45)
the exact same 16 like six Pokemon it (53:42 - 53:47)
can be matches gonna be super super (53:45 - 53:48)
dynamic and there's so much skill (53:47 - 53:50)
involved even when people are using the (53:48 - 53:52)
same Pokemon but I generally like (53:50 - 53:54)
the public especially if you look at (53:52 - 53:55)
like the comments on like a World Finals (53:54 - 53:56)
everyone's like oh my god I can't (53:55 - 53:58)
believe they're using the same legendary (53:56 - 53:59)
Pokemon it's so cheap like you know this (53:58 - 54:01)
isn't the way to play and part of what (53:59 - 54:03)
made this year I think more interesting (54:01 - 54:05)
was that you know there were no (54:03 - 54:06)
legendary Pokemon around and so you (54:05 - 54:08)
might see some of the same Pokemon but (54:06 - 54:10)
in general I feel like a lot of people (54:08 - 54:11)
who don't follow competitive have this (54:10 - 54:12)
like negative perception towards (54:11 - 54:16)
legendary Pokemon so I think one thing I (54:12 - 54:17)
liked about this format was that there (54:16 - 54:18)
were none of those and honestly I would (54:17 - 54:20)
be down for VGC to like never include (54:18 - 54:22)
legendary Pokemon again just because (54:20 - 54:24)
that one small change I feel like really (54:22 - 54:27)
affects how the general public who might (54:24 - 54:29)
not follow a competitive really perceive (54:27 - 54:31)
the scene but um yeah I mean going back (54:29 - 54:34)
to your question I think competitive was (54:31 - 54:37)
very very good this year and yeah I (54:34 - 54:38)
don't know how intentional was for them (54:37 - 54:40)
and like when they were picking Pokemon (54:38 - 54:42)
and make the Pokedex but everything that (54:40 - 54:43)
did end up making it through I think (54:42 - 54:44)
resulted in a healthy format and that (54:43 - 54:47)
was super fun to watch and play in then (54:44 - 54:49)
there was this hive mindset of like oh (54:47 - 54:51)
see they don't care about competitive (54:49 - 54:54)
because GMAC Stretton all sets up (54:51 - 54:56)
stealth rock but in reality if you (54:54 - 54:58)
actually watch competitive no one really (54:56 - 55:01)
is using stealth hmm and then you have (54:58 - 55:02)
these players that are like well if they (55:01 - 55:05)
compared it cared about competitive why (55:02 - 55:07)
are they allowing alterna crows more why (55:05 - 55:09)
they're allowing mega rayquaza (55:07 - 55:11)
correct so do you think that's like part (55:09 - 55:13)
of that perspective is like they have (55:11 - 55:15)
let these powerful Pokemon be in the (55:13 - 55:18)
game before yeah definitely I think a (55:15 - 55:20)
lot of people's perceptions often get (55:18 - 55:22)
warped because they either look at like (55:20 - 55:25)
a 2015 is the best example of this where (55:22 - 55:27)
like seven of the top eight teams from (55:25 - 55:28)
the World Championships had like (55:27 - 55:29)
Cresselia Heatran and mungus Landers and (55:28 - 55:31)
King it's gone it was all Japanese (55:29 - 55:33)
players and everyone always like points (55:31 - 55:34)
little graphic of the top eight teams (55:33 - 55:36)
from that specific term and they're like (55:34 - 55:38)
yeah this is a great example of how like (55:36 - 55:39)
undiversified (55:38 - 55:41)
this is why it's like not a good (55:39 - 55:44)
competitive game which like that always (55:41 - 55:46)
bothers me a lot for two reasons one if (55:44 - 55:48)
you look at the teams just beyond the (55:46 - 55:49)
top eight that year there were so many (55:48 - 55:51)
diverse pokemon and teams used it just (55:49 - 55:52)
so happened that the japanese players (55:51 - 55:54)
made like a good meta game called that (55:52 - 55:56)
tournament and second of all those like (55:54 - 55:57)
players played immensely well with those (55:56 - 55:59)
teams and like even the mirror matches (55:57 - 56:01)
were incredibly incredibly skillful (55:59 - 56:04)
so I think and then and then you know (56:01 - 56:05)
they also play (56:04 - 56:06)
sometimes look at like 2016 or like oh (56:05 - 56:08)
my god like like you said mega rayquaza (56:06 - 56:10)
primal Kyogre primal Groudon like what (56:08 - 56:12)
the heck is going on at the end of the (56:10 - 56:13)
day competitive players are gonna play (56:12 - 56:16)
whatever is given to them so you know we (56:13 - 56:18)
don't get some much say on what we want (56:16 - 56:20)
the competitive format to be we're (56:18 - 56:21)
basically told hey play this and as (56:20 - 56:23)
competitive players we're always just (56:21 - 56:24)
gonna play what we're asked to play in (56:23 - 56:27)
the VGC you know rule set yeah I don't (56:24 - 56:29)
know I'm personally very scared about (56:27 - 56:30)
like things like Lander is being allowed (56:29 - 56:33)
back in mainly because I feel like we're (56:30 - 56:34)
really on the right direction and this (56:33 - 56:37)
format was super promising but if they (56:34 - 56:38)
do allow these legendaries back in I'm (56:37 - 56:40)
gonna play right because I'm a (56:38 - 56:41)
competitive player and a concentrator (56:40 - 56:43)
I'm gonna do whatever I'm gonna follow (56:41 - 56:45)
the rule set why I have to play because (56:43 - 56:47)
like if you want to protest then you (56:45 - 56:48)
don't play well then you're not going to (56:47 - 56:49)
torment you're not really doing anything (56:48 - 56:53)
right another complaint part of the the (56:49 - 56:55)
decks it's tough and I think this this (56:53 - 56:57)
kind of gets forgotten about but they (56:55 - 56:59)
this was a huge complaint when the game (56:57 - 57:00)
came out but they cut over 70 different (56:59 - 57:04)
moves and specifically I think out of (57:00 - 57:06)
the 70 I can really only remember like (57:04 - 57:09)
what hidden power return pursuit but I (57:06 - 57:11)
mean do you think this was the right (57:09 - 57:13)
move do you think cutting you know 70 (57:11 - 57:16)
plus moves or competitive for the series (57:13 - 57:19)
was the right decision uh in the end the (57:16 - 57:21)
move cuts don't seem to feel super (57:19 - 57:22)
relevant in BDC (57:21 - 57:25)
I mean like return toxic and hidden (57:22 - 57:27)
power were used previously but I don't (57:25 - 57:30)
think anyone was like really complaining (57:27 - 57:32)
in bgca let those moves no longer exist (57:30 - 57:34)
it might be different in singles play (57:32 - 57:35)
honestly because I know what Cox sake is (57:34 - 57:37)
like a very very big deal in singles as (57:35 - 57:39)
is something like hit empower him how (57:37 - 57:40)
was used a fair amount in BGC as well (57:39 - 57:42)
but yeah I don't know I guess I'm pretty (57:40 - 57:44)
indifferent about those moves being cut (57:42 - 57:45)
that I don't feel like it's really (57:44 - 57:47)
affected VGC and I think like once again (57:45 - 57:49)
players would have played regardless of (57:47 - 57:51)
whether they were caught or not caught (57:49 - 57:52)
but in the end he doesn't feel like it (57:51 - 57:54)
made any big substantial difference and (57:52 - 57:56)
I don't know if they ended up cutting it (57:54 - 57:58)
whether they specifically said it was (57:56 - 57:59)
for competitive reasons or just because (57:58 - 58:01)
of like coding mechanics but at the end (57:59 - 58:03)
of the day I guess I haven't given it (58:01 - 58:04)
much thought because I don't feel like I (58:03 - 58:06)
really miss them nor do I feel like they (58:04 - 58:09)
were needed so yeah no no up sites are (58:06 - 58:11)
downsides at least relevant to VGC I (58:09 - 58:13)
would say regarding those Togekiss seems (58:11 - 58:15)
to be the purse the Pokemon that kind of (58:13 - 58:17)
rig rose to the top and in sword and (58:15 - 58:19)
shield here mm-hmm (58:17 - 58:21)
that is Togekiss like the new Landorus (58:19 - 58:22)
in the sense of everyone's gonna point (58:21 - 58:24)
at something and say look at everyone (58:22 - 58:27)
just as Togekiss I guess to an extent I (58:24 - 58:29)
don't know I mean they function a little (58:27 - 58:30)
bit differently and I think like if (58:29 - 58:32)
people that don't understand the game (58:30 - 58:33)
competitively wanted to just point to (58:32 - 58:35)
like the most used Pokemon then yeah (58:33 - 58:37)
like Togekiss and drag a folder like the (58:35 - 58:39)
easy targets III do think drag revolt (58:37 - 58:41)
could have been toned down a little bit (58:39 - 58:43)
it's just so fast and weakness policy (58:41 - 58:44)
makes it super powerful as well as life (58:43 - 58:46)
orb and the fact that like both of those (58:44 - 58:48)
are so viable makes it scary I mean the (58:46 - 58:51)
r8 main reason like pokemon white omeka (58:48 - 58:52)
sand dragon whole Drusilla very top is (58:51 - 58:54)
because they're super good both in in (58:52 - 58:56)
Dynomax and outside of dynamics but (58:54 - 58:57)
specifically in dynamics like you have (58:56 - 58:59)
these really bulky pokemon they're also (58:57 - 59:01)
able to just distribute so much damage (58:59 - 59:04)
and both of those for example get access (59:01 - 59:06)
to a flying-type attack so they can use (59:04 - 59:07)
max airstream to boost the speed and one (59:06 - 59:09)
thing that's really important in BGC of (59:07 - 59:12)
speed control and you know dynamaxx max (59:09 - 59:14)
moves affects also affect your partner (59:12 - 59:15)
so you can use max airstream with either (59:14 - 59:17)
trouble kiss or drag opposed to boost (59:15 - 59:19)
but that Pokemon speed and the partner (59:17 - 59:20)
Pokemon speed that's kind of the reason (59:19 - 59:22)
I'm like one of the other reasons why (59:20 - 59:23)
these Pokemon are so good is because you (59:22 - 59:24)
can run so many different sets for (59:23 - 59:27)
example Oh Togekiss you see really bulky (59:24 - 59:28)
sets but you also see really offensive (59:27 - 59:30)
sets I've seen like five or six (59:28 - 59:32)
different items being run on it with (59:30 - 59:34)
different abilities as well skillful and (59:32 - 59:35)
super luck is common but you also have (59:34 - 59:38)
like the very very Lum berry so many (59:35 - 59:40)
different items that are just viable and (59:38 - 59:42)
it's similar with drag repulse as well I (59:40 - 59:43)
guess your question was comparing it to (59:42 - 59:47)
Landorus and I don't know how I would (59:43 - 59:50)
say I feel like it's better to have (59:47 - 59:51)
something like Toby kisser drivers will (59:50 - 59:52)
be common than Landorus mainly because (59:51 - 59:54)
once again people's perception of just (59:52 - 59:56)
like a legendary Pokemon like there's (59:54 - 59:57)
like a negative stigma I feel like (59:56 - 59:59)
associated with them what do you think (59:57 - 60:01)
the worst move in the VGC is and why is (59:59 - 60:05)
it a lie switch yeah actually if there's (60:01 - 60:07)
one move I could remove from this (60:05 - 60:08)
generation you'd probably be a lie (60:07 - 60:11)
switch mainly because a lot about VGC is (60:08 - 60:13)
you know making informed predictions and (60:11 - 60:14)
plays based on what your opponent has (60:13 - 60:16)
but they for some reason just gave a lie (60:14 - 60:18)
switch to so many different pokemons so (60:16 - 60:20)
like it is very it's nearly impossible (60:18 - 60:22)
to predict like an ally switch from (60:20 - 60:23)
something that doesn't run it typically (60:22 - 60:25)
for example Rotom and to kiss don't (60:23 - 60:27)
really run a lie switch but you could (60:25 - 60:29)
tuck it in and it just like feels super (60:27 - 60:30)
frustrating to go up against something (60:29 - 60:32)
like it's very hard to (60:30 - 60:35)
you know see coming and I think like the (60:32 - 60:37)
move itself is also like you can just (60:35 - 60:39)
spam it as well like I would have liked (60:37 - 60:41)
it if you can't use it consecutively I'm (60:39 - 60:43)
just I'm not sure why they decided to (60:41 - 60:45)
give so many Pokemon access to it but I (60:43 - 60:47)
do think Alice which is like just not (60:45 - 60:50)
very healthy because it induces like a (60:47 - 60:52)
lot of like random guessing that I feel (60:50 - 60:54)
like shouldn't be included in the game (60:52 - 60:55)
and maybe that's like different based (60:54 - 60:56)
off how your philosophy of the (60:55 - 60:59)
competitive game is but Alice which was (60:56 - 61:00)
one I think that's probably the biggest (60:59 - 61:02)
one to me also like rock slide being (61:00 - 61:03)
able to flinch is a big deal because (61:02 - 61:05)
it's already such a good move and like (61:03 - 61:06)
they still have the same flinch chance (61:05 - 61:08)
although it's not nearly as prevalent as (61:06 - 61:09)
saying like Flandre spamming rocks like (61:08 - 61:12)
from back in the day but yeah I think (61:09 - 61:13)
you're you say now a switch is an (61:12 - 61:18)
accurate one for sure do you think that (61:13 - 61:20)
like overall there's too much randomness (61:18 - 61:22)
and VGC I feel like a lot of times the (61:20 - 61:24)
maybe maybe that's intentional I like (61:22 - 61:27)
like I've played a I've played a lot of (61:24 - 61:28)
the Pokemon Trading Card Game (61:27 - 61:31)
competitively and a lot of the (61:28 - 61:33)
competitive in the TCG really came down (61:31 - 61:36)
to I just needed one more turn yeah and (61:33 - 61:39)
when I've I've dabbled in VGC or when (61:36 - 61:41)
I've watched me VGC it's always like oh (61:39 - 61:45)
if they just got that coin flip right (61:41 - 61:47)
they would have won do you do you think (61:45 - 61:49)
that's like too much not enough maybe it (61:47 - 61:51)
is designed to be like oh well I (61:49 - 61:53)
heads or tails I would have won that I (61:51 - 61:56)
think if you don't know anything about (61:53 - 61:58)
VGC it can seem like a lot of coin (61:56 - 61:59)
flipping an orangey and it certainly is (61:58 - 62:01)
sweet extent but I always compare VGC to (61:59 - 62:05)
poker where any top player can lose on a (62:01 - 62:08)
given day but conversely someone (62:05 - 62:10)
starting out has the potential to be (62:08 - 62:13)
like the world's best and for example (62:10 - 62:15)
like I follow chess and chess is a game (62:13 - 62:17)
where I'm just never gonna be able to (62:15 - 62:18)
beat like the world's best player ever (62:17 - 62:22)
but with a game like Pokemon there VGC (62:18 - 62:24)
the best player will win the majority of (62:22 - 62:25)
the time but the fact is that you give (62:24 - 62:28)
the opportunity for someone who might (62:25 - 62:29)
not be as good as them to beat them and (62:28 - 62:30)
I think that's exciting you know that's (62:29 - 62:33)
part of the draw if I you know I'm (62:30 - 62:34)
talking to a bunch of people that just (62:33 - 62:35)
started playing - they're like you know (62:34 - 62:37)
I went to my first tournament and I want (62:35 - 62:38)
some games and that was exciting to me (62:37 - 62:41)
and in a lot of other competitive games (62:38 - 62:44)
where it's purely skill based like you (62:41 - 62:45)
wouldn't see that really happen ever but (62:44 - 62:46)
I (62:45 - 62:47)
I do think like if I could tone down (62:46 - 62:49)
some RNG and VGC I would for example I'd (62:47 - 62:51)
get rid of like the like fries I think (62:49 - 62:52)
is just a terrible mechanic that (62:51 - 62:54)
shouldn't be in the game I get rid of (62:52 - 62:56)
like flinching on moves like rockslide (62:54 - 62:59)
and I would also maybe change how (62:56 - 63:01)
something like sleep warps for example (62:59 - 63:02)
and reduce like some of the variants but (63:01 - 63:04)
I do think let a little bit of variance (63:02 - 63:05)
is not bad for a competitive game and I (63:04 - 63:09)
think like there's a reason why every (63:05 - 63:10)
time you look at a tournament like (63:09 - 63:12)
whoever wins these major tournaments are (63:10 - 63:15)
excellent excellent players and you need (63:12 - 63:16)
to get a little bit lucky to do well in (63:15 - 63:18)
a tournament but you also need to play (63:16 - 63:20)
phenomenally well so I think RNG is (63:18 - 63:22)
often a lot less relevant than people (63:20 - 63:24)
think and one thing that prohibits (63:22 - 63:26)
people from getting better is blaming (63:24 - 63:28)
their losses purely on luck when in (63:26 - 63:29)
reality because there's so many (63:28 - 63:31)
decisions to be made in competitive VGC (63:29 - 63:33)
there's always almost always I should (63:31 - 63:35)
say something better you could have done (63:33 - 63:37)
whether it was a better move to reduce (63:35 - 63:39)
the variance later on in the game for (63:37 - 63:41)
example like sometimes people will point (63:39 - 63:42)
to losing because they missed an attack (63:41 - 63:44)
well you know top players often evaluate (63:42 - 63:45)
and be like ok was there anything I (63:44 - 63:46)
could have done so that I didn't even (63:45 - 63:48)
need to use an inaccurate attack whether (63:46 - 63:50)
it was in the actual game or in the team (63:48 - 63:52)
building process so there's so many (63:50 - 63:54)
factors including team building and (63:52 - 63:57)
playing but it's very hard to just break (63:54 - 63:58)
down a loss solely to bad luck and (63:57 - 63:59)
sometimes you will have those losses (63:58 - 64:01)
right sometimes you do get really really (63:59 - 64:03)
unlucky and there truly is nothing (64:01 - 64:04)
better let you could have done but I (64:03 - 64:06)
think one thing that makes people (64:04 - 64:08)
improve rapidly is when they actually (64:06 - 64:10)
sit down and value 8 their losses let (64:08 - 64:12)
they think is due to bad luck and I (64:10 - 64:14)
understand to say like 90 plus percent (64:12 - 64:15)
of the time there was something better (64:14 - 64:16)
that could have been done either in the (64:15 - 64:18)
team building process or the battling (64:16 - 64:20)
process to have mitigated that so I (64:18 - 64:23)
think Pocomoke would probably still see (64:20 - 64:25)
some less rng like freeze I think should (64:23 - 64:26)
just be reduced I would probably change (64:25 - 64:28)
like the sleep mechanics just a little (64:26 - 64:30)
bit but in general I think some variance (64:28 - 64:31)
is healthy for a competitive game (64:30 - 64:32)
because then you don't get the same (64:31 - 64:34)
games over and over again so if (64:32 - 64:35)
somebody's like listening and they're (64:34 - 64:37)
like inspired by what you just said like (64:35 - 64:39)
how do how do they even get into (64:37 - 64:40)
competitive at this point besides like (64:39 - 64:42)
the general like watch a YouTube video (64:40 - 64:46)
and rent a team like like you are right (64:42 - 64:48)
in there there needs to be practice (64:46 - 64:50)
there needs to be evaluation but like (64:48 - 64:52)
how how does one even do that yeah I (64:50 - 64:54)
think the first thing is just knowing (64:52 - 64:56)
the top resources knowing where to go so (64:54 - 64:59)
you know there are a lot of great (64:56 - 65:00)
resources out there like (64:59 - 65:02)
tower in Victory Road these websites (65:00 - 65:03)
have a lot of articles and team reports (65:02 - 65:05)
like and help people get started out and (65:03 - 65:06)
rental teams as we've talked about (65:05 - 65:09)
there's also a lot of great content (65:06 - 65:10)
creators online both on YouTube and (65:09 - 65:12)
twitch so watching top players is always (65:10 - 65:13)
you know just a great way to improve but (65:12 - 65:16)
on a more deep level what I recommend to (65:13 - 65:18)
people who want to get into VGC is team (65:16 - 65:20)
building is really really important but (65:18 - 65:21)
it's an art in VGC and it's hard and I (65:20 - 65:22)
think a lot of players often get (65:21 - 65:24)
discouraged because you know they lose (65:22 - 65:27)
as a consequence of not knowing like (65:24 - 65:28)
fundamental team mechanics and so (65:27 - 65:29)
they're at a disadvantage because of (65:28 - 65:31)
their teams so I always recommend people (65:29 - 65:32)
once they're starting out to first like (65:31 - 65:34)
try to understand the fundamentals by (65:32 - 65:36)
playing with the team what is proven to (65:34 - 65:38)
be successful so whether that's a rental (65:36 - 65:40)
team from like a you know world champion (65:38 - 65:41)
or just something that seems very (65:40 - 65:43)
consistent hard shirt room is actually (65:41 - 65:45)
something I often recommend because it's (65:43 - 65:47)
relatively easy to use and it helps you (65:45 - 65:48)
show the fundamentals of the game but (65:47 - 65:50)
yeah if you're like getting into it play (65:48 - 65:53)
games try all the team that is you know (65:50 - 65:55)
good let's fundamentally strong and also (65:53 - 65:57)
don't play just for the sake of like (65:55 - 65:58)
playing games like I think it's really (65:57 - 65:59)
important to evaluate each of your wins (65:58 - 66:01)
and losses every time I lose a game I'll (65:59 - 66:03)
ask myself why would I lose that game (66:01 - 66:05)
and what could I have done better to (66:03 - 66:07)
have won the game and often there are (66:05 - 66:09)
two answers to that it's either making (66:07 - 66:10)
better plays perhaps I made a play that (66:09 - 66:12)
was too risky perhaps I made a play that (66:10 - 66:15)
was just like a prediction but it was a (66:12 - 66:17)
prediction that wasn't gonna work out (66:15 - 66:19)
most of the time like evaluate that (66:17 - 66:20)
sometimes it's your game play sometimes (66:19 - 66:22)
is that your team limited you and then (66:20 - 66:23)
so you have to ask yourself okay what (66:22 - 66:24)
could I've improved about my team but (66:23 - 66:26)
you know a lot of people when they play (66:24 - 66:28)
any competitive game likes to just keep (66:26 - 66:30)
grinding games but it's more important (66:28 - 66:32)
to learn from the game so I would say (66:30 - 66:34)
focus more on like especially losses (66:32 - 66:36)
look at the losses look at why you lost (66:34 - 66:38)
and try to answer that if you can answer (66:36 - 66:39)
it that's great because then you can (66:38 - 66:42)
approach you know towards improving and (66:39 - 66:43)
but if you're just playing games for the (66:42 - 66:44)
sake of playing games often you're not (66:43 - 66:46)
going to improve very rapidly in my (66:44 - 66:48)
opinion yeah I'm not like a personal (66:46 - 66:49)
experience I would say I lost because (66:48 - 66:52)
that was because I don't have a counter (66:49 - 66:56)
to laparis mmm-hmm is is that a thing (66:52 - 66:58)
and VGC like do you just see one pokemon (66:56 - 67:00)
and you go I can't beat that one pokemon (66:58 - 67:02)
but if they don't have it I'm good yeah (67:00 - 67:04)
I think that goes into the team building (67:02 - 67:06)
or if your team is struggling against (67:04 - 67:07)
something like every team should (67:06 - 67:09)
theoretically have a decent answer (67:07 - 67:12)
against anything so especially the top (67:09 - 67:13)
meta Pokemon right (67:12 - 67:16)
like part of what makes a really good (67:13 - 67:17)
team is that it gives you at least (67:16 - 67:19)
neutral to positive matchups against (67:17 - 67:20)
anything you could go up against now of (67:19 - 67:22)
course there's so many Pokemon in the (67:20 - 67:24)
game let you maybe can't cover for (67:22 - 67:26)
everything but if you can cover first (67:24 - 67:27)
say like the most like the 30 most (67:26 - 67:29)
common Pokemon and have some answer to (67:27 - 67:31)
it then at least you'll be able you'll (67:29 - 67:32)
most likely have answers to everything (67:31 - 67:34)
below that as well and sometimes maybe (67:32 - 67:36)
you do run into like one thing that (67:34 - 67:38)
makes teams the best teams really good (67:36 - 67:40)
is let top players come up with like (67:38 - 67:42)
really crazy sets that are creative that (67:40 - 67:44)
no one's all coming I think 2014 (67:42 - 67:46)
Pachirisu is often pointed to because (67:44 - 67:48)
that was something that very few people (67:46 - 67:50)
had on their radar and that's something (67:48 - 67:53)
where maybe in in throughout the course (67:50 - 67:54)
of that tournament people watch them (67:53 - 67:55)
they're like oh god I just don't have an (67:54 - 67:57)
answer against Pachirisu but that's why (67:55 - 67:58)
you know the best players are the way (67:57 - 67:59)
they are they're able to find these (67:58 - 68:01)
crazy Pokemon that work and make them (67:59 - 68:03)
you know to a strongest of their ability (68:01 - 68:05)
but I think if you're staring down a (68:03 - 68:07)
common Pokemon you're like oh my team (68:05 - 68:08)
just doesn't have a way to beat that (68:07 - 68:09)
then you need to go back to blue team (68:08 - 68:11)
building process and reevaluate what you (68:09 - 68:12)
can swap for it so for example if lapis (68:11 - 68:14)
is something that people are struggling (68:12 - 68:15)
with you want to look at okay what is (68:14 - 68:17)
ways to hit it for super effective (68:15 - 68:19)
damage electro types are easy to point (68:17 - 68:20)
to and then you want to evaluate okay (68:19 - 68:22)
what electric types fit with my team (68:20 - 68:24)
Rotom wash for example is often used (68:22 - 68:26)
because it resists both lappers this (68:24 - 68:29)
main types you use like nastyplot which (68:26 - 68:31)
is very common as well so that's why (68:29 - 68:33)
team-building is an art the best teams (68:31 - 68:34)
will have good answers against (68:33 - 68:36)
everything and I basically give you (68:34 - 68:38)
options so that you're not just (68:36 - 68:39)
struggling against something the (68:38 - 68:42)
entirety of the game with mints bottle (68:39 - 68:45)
caps all these things to make VG cz so (68:42 - 68:47)
much easier over the years do you think (68:45 - 68:48)
there's something else that we're (68:47 - 68:51)
missing that would even make the barrier (68:48 - 68:53)
to entry even lower at this point that's (68:51 - 68:56)
a really good question I think having (68:53 - 68:58)
something like a you know we have bottle (68:56 - 69:00)
caps for thirty-one IVs but having (68:58 - 69:01)
something like you'd make your IV like (69:00 - 69:03)
zero would be really nice because trick (69:01 - 69:04)
room you know teams often like using (69:03 - 69:06)
that and all the most optimal team in (69:04 - 69:08)
theory has the zero attack IV if you're (69:06 - 69:11)
not a physical attacker to reduce like (69:08 - 69:13)
confusion damage nothing something like (69:11 - 69:15)
that would be good I know one thing that (69:13 - 69:16)
they actually are doing now is like (69:15 - 69:18)
raids where the most common Pokemon are (69:16 - 69:20)
actually like the competitive Pokemon (69:18 - 69:21)
that you can get so I think like more of (69:20 - 69:23)
that would be really good especially (69:21 - 69:24)
like earlier all when people are just (69:23 - 69:26)
getting into it because now we're like (69:24 - 69:27)
what six months into sort (69:26 - 69:28)
she'll write having that earlier on is (69:27 - 69:30)
great but I think like grades are (69:28 - 69:31)
excellent being able to give away high (69:30 - 69:33)
IB Pokemon immediately is great (69:31 - 69:36)
I think mints were much needed I guess (69:33 - 69:37)
maybe another capsule where you could (69:36 - 69:39)
get like hidden abilities those like I (69:37 - 69:41)
think hidden abilities and zero Ivy's (69:39 - 69:42)
are like the last two things I feel like (69:41 - 69:45)
they could cover but I do think the gap (69:42 - 69:48)
has really really been covered the gap (69:45 - 69:49)
at least from like last generation with (69:48 - 69:50)
this generation and I was like super (69:49 - 69:53)
super accessible so any other changes (69:50 - 69:55)
would be a lot smaller than say going (69:53 - 69:56)
into this generation we talked about (69:55 - 69:59)
some moves that that you didn't really (69:56 - 70:01)
care for like sleep mechanics flinch (69:59 - 70:03)
Ally switch that kind of stuff is there (70:01 - 70:04)
like held items that you feel like need (70:03 - 70:07)
to be pulled from the game or that are (70:04 - 70:09)
just too powerful I mean you brought up (70:07 - 70:11)
weakness policy a lot as a very powerful (70:09 - 70:14)
item yeah I think it's less about the (70:11 - 70:15)
item and I guess more about the (70:14 - 70:17)
interaction with Dynomax (70:15 - 70:19)
I think like Dynomax was a really cool (70:17 - 70:21)
mechanic and I mean I'm fine playing in (70:19 - 70:22)
a meta game or like life or maybe just (70:21 - 70:24)
policy exists on Dynomax moms but I (70:22 - 70:26)
think like it would be cool for example (70:24 - 70:27)
if like weakness policy didn't work on a (70:26 - 70:29)
Dynomax mom maybe like it could work (70:27 - 70:31)
before you Dynomax which forces you to (70:29 - 70:34)
attack it and for that but want to take (70:31 - 70:35)
potentially more damage because you know (70:34 - 70:37)
you can only use it before Dynomax I (70:35 - 70:39)
think like making life or just not work (70:37 - 70:41)
on Dynomax Pokemon would be an (70:39 - 70:42)
interesting interaction I don't think (70:41 - 70:44)
the items inherently are broken is just (70:42 - 70:45)
about how they interact with like (70:44 - 70:47)
Dynomax specifically there isn't (70:45 - 70:49)
anything that makes me be like wow like (70:47 - 70:50)
this is just so brought busted like this (70:49 - 70:53)
I'm going to play the game um you know (70:50 - 70:54)
that's like the main day at least it (70:53 - 70:56)
feels like everything like has some (70:54 - 70:58)
answer but I think the biggest ones let (70:56 - 71:00)
biggest offenders people point to it wit (70:58 - 71:01)
Dynomax in DGC are definitely like life (71:00 - 71:04)
orb weakness policy and then like scope (71:01 - 71:06)
lens Togekiss can be frustrating play (71:04 - 71:07)
against because you get to critical hit (71:06 - 71:11)
50% of the time with super luck but yeah (71:07 - 71:13)
I don't know I I think it's like not all (71:11 - 71:15)
of those are at least like decently (71:13 - 71:17)
chapped it's not like the worst case but (71:15 - 71:19)
if I had it my way I would probably like (71:17 - 71:20)
reduce the interactions they have with (71:19 - 71:22)
Dynomax specifically in an ideal world (71:20 - 71:24)
in an in an ideal world is there a (71:22 - 71:27)
Pokemon or a few Pokemon that you would (71:24 - 71:29)
wish that would just somehow be better (71:27 - 71:31)
in competitive whether it's being held (71:29 - 71:34)
back by ability or stats or move pool (71:31 - 71:37)
that's a good question um I'd have to (71:34 - 71:39)
give that some thought I think like (71:37 - 71:40)
Glaceon is one of my all-time (71:39 - 71:43)
Pokemon so I'd have to root for that (71:40 - 71:45)
mainly because I mean it's pretty strong (71:43 - 71:47)
overall and it's actually used somewhat (71:45 - 71:49)
in the format it's not like completely (71:47 - 71:52)
under completely not used but I'd like (71:49 - 71:53)
to see it be a little bit more viable (71:52 - 71:56)
I mean Empoleon and scissor aren't in (71:53 - 71:57)
the game but those are two of my (71:56 - 71:58)
all-time favorite Pokemon said I prefer (71:57 - 72:00)
I think Flygon is like a you know (71:58 - 72:02)
hometown favor for so many people that (72:00 - 72:04)
land they're like always kind of fall (72:02 - 72:05)
short relative to the other Dragon types (72:04 - 72:07)
I wish they could like because wagon is (72:05 - 72:08)
such a cool Pokemon so it has such an (72:07 - 72:09)
interesting (72:08 - 72:11)
well everyone thought I was gonna have a (72:09 - 72:13)
mega evolution as well and then they (72:11 - 72:14)
baited us and didn't give us a mega (72:13 - 72:16)
evolution for it so those are just (72:14 - 72:18)
something that jumped to mind all right (72:16 - 72:19)
Aaron well I don't want to eat up too (72:18 - 72:22)
much of your time I'm assuming your (72:19 - 72:25)
favorite Pokemon is still Rotom wash (72:22 - 72:27)
yeah I don't watch competitively but (72:25 - 72:29)
Piplup is I think my all-time just if I (72:27 - 72:31)
pick one Pokemon just cuz it's so cute (72:29 - 72:33)
and I like penguins alright awesome and (72:31 - 72:36)
now you you have your own youtube videos (72:33 - 72:37)
about teaching people to get in (72:36 - 72:39)
competitive you're streaming on Twitch (72:37 - 72:42)
so are those good resources for somebody (72:39 - 72:44)
who is never you know touch competitive (72:42 - 72:45)
but has always been interested to go to (72:44 - 72:48)
to dabble in yeah definitely I mean I (72:45 - 72:50)
think like trainer tower Victory Road (72:48 - 72:53)
Nimbus City Post are just some websites (72:50 - 72:55)
like if you go to get started you want (72:53 - 72:56)
to definitely check out the rental team (72:55 - 72:59)
sections as well Victory Road has as (72:56 - 73:01)
well stern actually they both have a lot (72:59 - 73:02)
of grassroots events as well so I'm just (73:01 - 73:05)
playing in those are good and yeah you (73:02 - 73:07)
can find me at Cybertron productions on (73:05 - 73:09)
YouTube at Cybertron BGC on Twitch I (73:07 - 73:11)
tried to be as educational and (73:09 - 73:13)
interactive as possible and my goal was (73:11 - 73:14)
really to just help us see you continue (73:13 - 73:16)
to grow try to be a you know easy way to (73:14 - 73:18)
get into the game but there's a lot of (73:16 - 73:20)
other really great content creators in (73:18 - 73:21)
Wolfie click is kind of the face of the (73:20 - 73:24)
community and he has a lot of (73:21 - 73:25)
entertaining videos but he's also just (73:24 - 73:27)
one of if not the best player ever (73:25 - 73:28)
really from the history of the game so (73:27 - 73:31)
he is definitely a great resources as (73:28 - 73:32)
well there are a ton of other great (73:31 - 73:35)
content creators that you can find (73:32 - 73:36)
online if anyone watching this is (73:35 - 73:37)
curious feel free to like DM me on (73:36 - 73:40)
Twitter Rock and happy refer you to all (73:37 - 73:41)
the list of them there's just so many (73:40 - 73:44)
out there nowadays but yeah in general (73:41 - 73:46)
it's a lot easier to get into VGC now (73:44 - 73:47)
than it was years ago and there are a (73:46 - 73:49)
lot of people working hard to try to (73:47 - 73:51)
make it more accessible to people so if (73:49 - 73:53)
you're interested in trying it out don't (73:51 - 73:54)
be afraid to (73:53 - 73:56)
and one piece of advice I always give to (73:54 - 73:58)
people starting out is that like losing (73:56 - 74:00)
is actually the best thing that can (73:58 - 74:01)
happen people get frustrated in any (74:00 - 74:03)
competitive game when they lose but the (74:01 - 74:05)
thing is that you only get to grow as a (74:03 - 74:06)
player when you are able to evaluate (74:05 - 74:08)
your losses and once you can see what (74:06 - 74:09)
you're doing wrong then you'll be able (74:08 - 74:12)
to improve thank you thank you for being (74:09 - 74:13)
on air and I really appreciate it any (74:12 - 74:20)
time thank you for having me why is (74:13 - 74:24)

will bring you hot items such as (76:40 - 76:42)
pokeballs throughout the event (76:41 - 76:45)
I am surprised I've been streaming (76:42 - 76:47)
Pokemon go on Twitch a lot more recently (76:45 - 76:49)
I've been doing it every Tuesday night (76:47 - 76:51)
anytime there's one of these carvanha (76:49 - 76:54)
thing events I am so shocked (76:51 - 76:57)
constantly I get questions of like how (76:54 - 76:59)
does your how did your buddy bounce back (76:57 - 77:01)
a pokeball (76:59 - 77:01)
being good it's such a good animation (77:02 - 77:05)
it's a really good at yeah it's a really (77:04 - 77:07)
good surprise the first time it happened (77:05 - 77:10)
because I had no warning but then I sort (77:07 - 77:13)
of I pieced that puzzle together people (77:10 - 77:15)
still not playing with their buddies I (77:13 - 77:17)
guess I don't know even I did the math (77:15 - 77:19)
because I think you need 30 hearts in (77:17 - 77:23)
total to get to the these two heart (77:19 - 77:26)
thing it's either 30 or 40 but if you (77:23 - 77:28)
were to do the bare minimum which is (77:26 - 77:30)
give your buddy 3 berries and then while (77:28 - 77:32)
you're doing that Pettitte and then take (77:30 - 77:34)
a picture but you know what I do no (77:32 - 77:38)
walking no battling no finding a new (77:34 - 77:40)
place you do the minimum of three hearts (77:38 - 77:44)
a day you can do from your bed you'll (77:40 - 77:46)
get there in like 10 to 12 days like (77:44 - 77:48)

maybe it's like when we were looking at (79:01 - 79:04)
the forest (79:03 - 79:06)
I'm like it's gotta be just like this (79:04 - 79:08)
forest thing which is pretty cool I mean (79:06 - 79:10)
I'm in yeah I'm sure it's like what was (79:08 - 79:12)
the forest though it was like an hour (79:10 - 79:15)
loop but like every hour they like (79:12 - 79:17)
five seconds of something yeah I mean (79:15 - 79:20)

it's the thing is is that it's really (84:26 - 84:32)
as we get new Pokemon and they make more (84:30 - 84:35)
complex cries its R it's so obvious I (84:32 - 84:38)
just wish they would update them I'm (84:35 - 84:39)
really this point with some of the new (84:38 - 84:42)
cries that they they're like there's (84:39 - 84:43)
like this fine line where they want to (84:42 - 84:45)
make new and better cries but they also (84:43 - 84:47)
want to try to make them not sound super (84:45 - 84:51)
far out from old stuff but man like when (84:47 - 84:52)

believe she called out her boyfriend at (85:32 - 85:36)
the beginning of that song but well yeah (85:34 - 85:39)
that's a different era yep this is from (85:36 - 85:41)
Casey what are you currently working (85:39 - 85:43)
towards not necessarily Pokemon related (85:41 - 85:45)
example I am working towards learning (85:43 - 85:48)
web programming I'm writing another RPG (85:45 - 85:52)
and I'm working on Steven universe rules (85:48 - 85:54)
for glitter hurts right now how many (85:52 - 85:59)
RPGs are you like king of RPG I said (85:54 - 86:00)
that wasn't gonna write another one and (85:59 - 86:03)
then I started writing it so don't ask (86:00 - 86:07)
me I just started it it may go nowhere I (86:03 - 86:09)
may hate it but I started writing it (86:07 - 86:11)
what about you Steve what are your (86:09 - 86:16)
dreams and ambitions what she's I mean (86:11 - 86:19)
like trying to get things ready for our (86:16 - 86:24)
ten-year anniversary I'm already working (86:19 - 86:26)
on the song for the 10 year okay good I (86:24 - 86:28)
feel like it's sneaking up very fast I (86:26 - 86:32)
mean it's already June I read and I were (86:28 - 86:34)
planning on traveling this year but that (86:32 - 86:37)
obviously didn't work but hopefully more (86:34 - 86:42)
travel next year Pokemon and non Pokemon (86:37 - 86:43)
related travel (86:42 - 86:46)
very hard because twitch requires you to (86:43 - 86:51)
be live so often so maybe incorporating (86:46 - 86:54)
I are all travel which I personally like (86:51 - 86:56)
to watch and bring that to twitch in (86:54 - 86:58)
some capacity would be something I would (86:56 - 87:01)
like to work for late timing right now (86:58 - 87:05)
is uh not good it's a late night stream (87:01 - 87:08)
watch me watch propertybrothers (87:05 - 87:13)
IRL the worst show ever how about you (87:08 - 87:14)
bill what are you currently working (87:13 - 87:16)
towards besides becoming a bike master (87:14 - 87:21)
well I mean that's part of it so since (87:16 - 87:24)
the majority of my normal travel (87:21 - 87:27)
schedule for the year has been nuked (87:24 - 87:33)
into oblivion I am thinking through a (87:27 - 87:37)
way to do a bike packing tour Oh fun (87:33 - 87:39)
so somewhere yeah that I mean I (87:37 - 87:40)
specifically bought the bike that I (87:39 - 87:43)
bought because it is very versatile and (87:40 - 87:47)
can be set up for reasonable bike (87:43 - 87:50)
packing so that'll be cool you should (87:47 - 87:53)
buy Cup to Duluth but to see the colors (87:50 - 87:57)
I mean maybe at some point and I do want (87:53 - 88:00)
I mean I want to do an outdoorsy stuff (87:57 - 88:03)
this year right I wanted to get kayak (88:00 - 88:07)
from Lake Minnetonka to the Mississippi (88:03 - 88:11)
which I've been told is possible and (88:07 - 88:15)
also potentially getting into mountain (88:11 - 88:17)
biking which is a variant from the type (88:15 - 88:20)
of biking I've been doing already I just (88:17 - 88:23)
obviously I have a niche for fitness (88:20 - 88:25)
that's not getting scratched at the gym (88:23 - 88:30)
right now so I'm exploding out into all (88:25 - 88:33)
kinds of weird and bizarre areas well (88:30 - 88:34)
you know what can help you with your (88:33 - 88:36)
bike questions (88:34 - 88:41)
um Kickstarter no no no no that's not my (88:36 - 88:43)
jam (88:41 - 88:47)
but looking forward to Kickstarter into (88:43 - 88:50)
the future I you know my favorite kind (88:47 - 88:53)
of tabletop game is a deck builder yes (88:50 - 88:57)
so I've been working on a deck builder (88:53 - 89:05)
but it's more oriented towards like (88:57 - 89:08)
children young adults it's more (89:05 - 89:12)
education well focused but I mean that (89:08 - 89:13)
doesn't mean you couldn't have fun (89:12 - 89:19)
playing it you've changed well how dare (89:13 - 89:23)
you how dare you how to develop poison (89:19 - 89:28)
in your chemistry class I had a science (89:23 - 89:28)
kit (89:28 - 89:31)
I know but trouble you can get into it (89:28 - 89:35)
that thing no it's not it's it's if (89:31 - 89:36)
somebody were to know me well enough (89:35 - 89:39)
they'd they'd know what I'm I'm aiming (89:36 - 89:42)
towards um but yeah it's gonna take a (89:39 - 89:43)
lot of work (89:42 - 89:45)
so yeah just something I'm working on on (89:43 - 89:47)
the site besides you know my job that (89:45 - 89:48)
makes me money (89:47 - 89:52)
mm-hmm oh wow the week all right so last (89:48 - 89:56)
week's Pokemon was a reference to a 90s (89:52 - 89:58)
movie about things happening in the (89:56 - 90:02)
Amazon that might be scary to you a (89:58 - 90:04)
couple of jump scares if you're (90:02 - 90:07)
especially if you don't like snake (90:04 - 90:11)
animals except then pretend that it (90:07 - 90:16)
happened in the desert okay okay (90:11 - 90:16)
[Music] (90:18 - 90:24)
you were so close I'm completely Rodan (90:21 - 90:25)
effort (90:24 - 90:30)
cuz it's sand akanda sand Akhanda based (90:25 - 90:35)
on the fantastic no 1997 horror film (90:30 - 90:39)
anaconda um I didn't reference Nicki (90:35 - 90:42)
Minaj at all you wish probably for the (90:39 - 90:43)
best (90:42 - 90:46)
mercy opportunity for the best and also (90:43 - 90:49)
listeners if you now go look up (90:46 - 90:52)
for each of the sequels and watch them (90:49 - 90:56)
go down in start quality cross see (90:52 - 90:59)
what's very interesting to me is that (90:56 - 91:01)
the last one was Lake Placid versus (90:59 - 91:08)
anaconda and I'm like crocodile vs snake (91:01 - 91:10)
look that's an actual thing that's (91:08 - 91:11)
happened you can look up the real (91:10 - 91:14)
version of that it's quite a OD it's (91:11 - 91:18)
quite a thing I don't know if Santa SC I (91:14 - 91:20)
don't know if Santa Conda has any trivia (91:18 - 91:22)
besides you know it's based on an (91:20 - 91:24)
anaconda and stuff as pokedex entry says (91:22 - 91:28)
when it contracts its body over 220 (91:24 - 91:31)
pounds of sand spray from its nose if it (91:28 - 91:33)
ever runs out of sand it becomes (91:31 - 91:38)
disheartened oh then it needs team yell (91:33 - 91:44)
to encourage it giganto max all right it (91:38 - 91:48)
now has more than a million tons of say (91:44 - 91:49)
jeez (91:48 - 91:51)
I don't think the Pokemon world has a (91:49 - 91:54)
good grasp of measurements I mean a (91:51 - 91:58)
million tons of sand you got the Sahara (91:54 - 91:58)
yes I gantt a max it's a combination of (91:59 - 92:08)
gigantic and maximum and Santa cata is a (92:04 - 92:12)
combination of sand and anaconda a place (92:08 - 92:14)
where the anacondas don't roam is the (92:12 - 92:17)
sand but oh well maybe there's an (92:14 - 92:20)
anaconda variant that whatever this (92:17 - 92:23)
week's Pokemon are you ready because I (92:20 - 92:30)
may have written this very poorly seven (92:23 - 92:34)
down ah no it's actually back more to (92:30 - 92:36)
our traditional style okay (92:34 - 92:39)
this week's delightful Pokemon made its (92:36 - 92:42)
debut in the Pokemon cartoon in Japan on (92:39 - 92:47)
May 8th 2003 and in the United States on (92:42 - 92:52)
February 28th 2004 while not the Pokemon (92:47 - 92:55)
featured in the title of the episode it (92:52 - 93:00)
is notable that it and it's close cousin (92:55 - 93:03)
evolve simultaneously (93:00 - 93:06)
the episode goes on the pre evolution (93:03 - 93:08)
for this week's Pokemon is shared with (93:06 - 93:11)
another Pokemon if you wish to have it (93:08 - 93:14)
evolve into this week's Pokemon it must (93:11 - 93:16)
meet a particular personality value in (93:14 - 93:20)
Hoenn personality values are tied to (93:16 - 93:23)
danger as well as gender ability (93:20 - 93:28)
shininess and size spindle spots and (93:23 - 93:31)
unknowns letter are also coordinated (93:28 - 93:33)
with personality value but neither of (93:31 - 93:36)
them is this week's Pokemon the (93:33 - 93:38)
determinant for this week's Pokemon is (93:36 - 93:41)
the result of a modulo operation where (93:38 - 93:43)
you take the upper half of the pokemons (93:41 - 93:47)
personality value modulo 10 if it is (93:43 - 93:50)
less than 4 you get one Pokemon if it is (93:47 - 93:52)
greater than 4 you get this week's (93:50 - 93:56)
Pokemon in a unique way this means that (93:52 - 93:58)
when breeding for this week's Pokemon (93:56 - 94:00)
you may use the final evolution for a (93:58 - 94:03)
completely different Pokemon to obtain (94:00 - 94:06)
our Pokemon for the week conversely you (94:03 - 94:08)
may obtain this week's Pokemon (94:06 - 94:10)
unexpectedly when breeding for a (94:08 - 94:13)
different one there is no action that (94:10 - 94:15)
you as the player can take to influence (94:13 - 94:18)
this the personality value is determined (94:15 - 94:20)
when you receive the egg from the (94:18 - 94:25)
Pokemon daycare there you go real easy (94:20 - 94:26)
and (94:25 - 94:29)
modulo is a real math term alright (94:26 - 94:31)
that's our show if you want to follow (94:29 - 94:34)
