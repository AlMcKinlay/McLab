hello if you're a new listener if you're clicking on this episode because you saw Aaron Zhang's name and the title and you just want to skip to that you want to get that out of the way for whatever reason you're like I don't want to listen to these boring guys I want listen Aaron that interview starts at about the 40 minute mark if you're new to the show we start off talking a little bit off topic and then we go into Pokemon news and then we do our main segment our main segment obviously this episode is Aaron want to hear the Pokemon news this episode we're gonna do everything regarding

normal listener hope you enjoy as well [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 409 of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SBJ with me Greg hello hello it's a rainy day here in Minnesota which allowed me to catch no shiney carvanha the antic looking out for you I know I didn't help that I was so we went grocery shopping and I forgot about it and then I came home and you were streaming so I fired it up and I did an hour with my incense and then I promptly fell asleep and then I woke back up at 4:30 with half an hour left and did another incense I'm like oh who's I sleeping but my main goal today happened I caught three scraggy so I count that as a win for me yeah that's pretty alright and you got an app that's on sweet and I got an app with two dogs will is also here thank you for allowing me to go second because now I'm about to take up you haven't knew it several hours of your time so I'm a free face that this is a Pokemon yes let's get the the small things out of the way first small thing I didn't do the car vanya event because I see a Shinto a caravan yeah I got all set up to do it and then I just got distracted by a butterfly and couldn't remember to get back to doing it so that's number two I am now proven bad at video games because part a didn't realize that I could use wishing pieces to complete my pokedex until I don't know when I texted you guys yesterday morning this morning pause what did you think wishing pieces were full I just didn't put it together that you just like I thought like when I would read in boba pedia and it was like oh you can get a jag moto from a max rate and I was like I have to wait for that to be written up in the game for me to go to to find that not for that like oh hey I can activate this day and that dude that I'm looking for it might just be in there so that's that's the realization I've come to six months later can I give you a pro tip sure so if you have to Denton's close to each other and you don't want to do the den you drop the wishing piece into you just go to the other den drop the wishing piece and then I decide if you want to do that if that's not good enough go to the back to the other den drop the wishing piece so you can go back and forth between two but they stay lit if you say you can only have one wishing piece active at a time when dropping a second wishing piece you deactivate the first one Wow but then I wasted up wishing well it would have been wasted anyways cuz I wasn't gonna go after that did na yeah that's probably true also wait there's no dedenne in this game I'm sorry Tokido Maru but that's not even the important thing here's the important thing bar P of I'm not good at video games and the beginning of I have cracked the code I have been weeping for weeks now because KK slider has not come to visit my Island and I was like what more I have all of these flowers I've got shrubs I've got walls I chopped down trees I planted what is it going to take to get KK slider to come to my Island do you the others Island do you know this now not about it no no no you literally and for anybody else who is in the cake elements here's a clue for you anybody who's in the cake hey lament hmm somebody's favorite song let me open the door for you you need to go to Tom Nook and say what should I do next oh yeah you do not do that he does not tell you you need to set up a campground but here now we're going to go one more layer deep folks I hope you're ready strap in because I'm about to blow your minds Animal Crossing is not some nice game for children to play it is the North Korea simulator this man this Tom Nook is a dictator who has tricked you into his socialist paradise where we're all judged by the value of the work that we put in and we're all contributing to society except strangely enough it seems that only one of me is contributing to society and what do I have to do I have to build this island to his standards and regulations and you know I have like a rating oh how well are you doing oh you've got enough trees wait no you don't have enough trees too many trees people are getting lost in the forest oh all of this senseless work just to keep my hands occupied and he's got his secret police aka the happy home Academy peering in my windows and walking in my unlocked door to judge how I'm living every morning unavoidably I have to listen to Island announcements about this is what we are going to be doing on the island today Thank You Isabelle right hand to the dictator but this is where it was all revealed to me was when the whole thing is a scheme because if there's anything that a North Korean dictator loves it is cult of personality celebrity handshakes and this whole island that I have been building for this person is just to attract Kay Kay slider to come and play cake a lament for mr. Tom Nook don't do it don't get tricked people that's all I'm sorry what and so the Pokemon of the week is not suppose gonna write in and say how Tom nooks not a raccoon and has he's a tanuki and how dare you call him though this is a Pokemon podcast if he's sick as a trash panda if you saw the title of the episode we have an interview with Aaron Zeng I probably already said this before the theme song started so if you wanted to jump to that you probably are not hearing this but that'll come after the break Aaron talks about his thoughts on the sword and shield edited and that actually leads us right into news somehow the stars aligned and there's a lot of competitive stuff to talk about this week so Aaron being on this episode was actually perfect pokemon sword and pokemon shield at

there's no safari zone and sword and shield there sure isn't big news this is actually I don't think anyone really saw this coming Pokemon is up with both these we're off Pokemon calm welcome on players cup on-line tournament the Pokemon TCG the pokken tournament DX and pokemon sword and shield all announced for online tournaments i think the only people happy about this are probably the pokken tournament people because they have zero expectation the fact that the game is still alive is good enough for them somebody remembered me how nice okay so the TCG okay let's put that one on the backburner all right look we're gonna get that one last cuz I got questions yeah yeah yeah let's not talk about right now the poke in turbinate DX competitors will be able to register directly for the first stage of the Pokemon players cup at a future date yeah I think I think I mean I think all pokken players are happy that their game is still getting love I don't like what happens in is this this is gonna be like I'm a Super Smash Brothers things where like people are still playing like oh yeah funny year old game boss stage no either is there even 256 people still playing pokken tournament high level apparently it's a register for this I mean there's like there what 8 million people in America like if 1% of them are playing pokken tournament that easily goes all those one percenters high your one out of a hundred people still playing pokken tournament i don't think so i think that's real high i just say yeah sure yeah it was point one percent that still easily get us a 256 out of the millions of people i did they even so really spoken sold like 2 million maybe I'm the switch I want to say I could be wrong I'd have to look that up you know I'm looking it up okay you look it up I'll talk about the Pokemon players Cup it will have two stages in July eligible players will compete in a double elimination bracket broken down by rating zones to determine the top player in each rating zone then those top finishes will face off in a final stage of the Pokemon players Cup in August where winners will become crowned the Pokemon players Cup champion and earn a travel award to a future international championship event hot sales numbers got him poker tournament DX which sold 1 point 1 3 million units in North America and Europe and 250,000 units in Japan which brings the total sales to 1.3 million yes if we say life type sales of the Wii U version of the game in their entirety what's the math on that like 100,000 like a hundred and thirty thousand yeah yeah maybe that's decent bring it 256 people the Pokemon CCG and V ji-sook PGC competitors will need to qualify through their performance in an upcoming event the Pokemon TCG competitors will qualify for the Pokemon players cup through ranking on June's leaderboard standard format tournament rep in the Pokemon Trading Card online pokemon sword and shield will qualify through the international challenge may online competition which runs May 21st through the 24th and we'll use the 2020 video game championship format in order to be eligible you need to link your Nintendo account to your trainer club account before signing up if you did that in past tournaments you'll be fine each the Pokemon TCG pokken tournament and pokemon sword and shield competitors will kick off a special Invitational event the winners will qualify for the final stage of the Pokemon Cup to make sure so make sure to follow along masters divisions competitions will use the sword and shield video game and they need to finish a lot among the top eligible trainers in their rating zone in the May international challenge to qualify for the Pokemon players Cup this weekend you're listening to this podcast on time and not in the in 2022 you will have to play the international challenge and come in in to end to qualify for this players Cup you have to come in top 256 for North America top 256 if you're in Europe top 128 if you're in Oceania and top 256 if you're in Latin America is Japan considered Oceania at this point yeah I think so I think so yeah good luck practice hard you can prove what it takes only masters division is opted to participate in all of the play pokemon events for the online tournament so that means you would have to be 6 15 or older to participate in these I think the sword and shield stuff is pretty straightforward they've already figured out in the past to link to award points to people this is maybe why they've been pretty strict on banning people who are purposely disconnecting and I have no worries that they're going to be watching people disconnecting through this tournament if they have not already fixed it or a remedy remedy it did it enough up to this point the only maybe complaint is like this is kind of super short notice here's the tournament here's the event you got to qualify you got like less than two weeks yeah kind of hard to build a team and compete and everything in that amount of time but school's out yep but we didn't think the Pokemon company was gonna do something but shout out to them like it's actually really cool that they were still trying to make this work especially when the majority people have nothing but good things to say about the current sword and shield competitive meta okay can I ask my good question let's talk about the Pokemon Trading Card Game [Laughter] so I have a deck of my physical cards that I was going to bring to the thing like the actual live tournament okay now it's online uh-huh how do I get my deck that I paid money for into who the computer game you don't yeah that's not how it works you have to oh boy talk about the history of the Pokemon Trading Card Game online it's made by direwolf digital and it was released in web browsers on March 24th 2011 and then moved over to Windows as an application on May 15th 2012 2012 8 years old and in nowhere in those 8 years have they've ever done this before I am NOT saying direwolf digital is bad I think they're maybe not given enough money slash resources from the Pokemon company to do what they want to do I mmm don't know who those battle animations are real sweet sure when unbroken bonds came out which was not that long ago there was a card in that set called fighting dojo right out of the gate it didn't work so instead what direwolf digital did probably because the Pokemon company told them to is they banned the card outside of its so it we've talked about this before but like if you're only practicing in the Pokemon Trading Card Game online to go to tournaments and a card that is brand-new that is vital to the deck that you're probably building is banned you can no longer practice with it and that card is still tournament legal but unless you have real-life people you have no way to practice and it took them I want to say four months to fix fighting dojo and this happening honestly there are other card simulators that you can use you don't have to use P TCG oh it's just that's the official one okay I've looked up dire wolf games mm-hmm I think this is a Pokemon problem I did think it is - I am they are so they have made the tabletop version of clank they are making the online version of route from leader games full disclosure I'm friends with Patrick that's mr. Lindner thank you yes Patrick leader so like I just don't like I think they could do a lot for the TCG if Pokemon gave them money so I'm I'm very curious if when this started before they announced this they were like okay we've let you just have this and we've not given you anything for a long time but we need you to make it a lot better like in a month because they have a lot of games like they have a lot of new games that they are they are putting out and there's a bunch of people that have put like putting their like renegade game studio which is not a small board game company is working with them to me it feels like they have a contract with direwolf and because the Pokemon TCG doesn't actually make the Pokemon company money and here's the other problem with it that it only exists outside of Japan because remember there's no client for Japanese players and we know from past conversations that we've had with people who have worked directly with the Pokemon company that even though the Pokemon headquarters is in Seattle or Redmond or we're in that area they still have to get everything approved by Japan it always just seems like we want to make the TCG better let's ask Japan oh it's not a priority because it doesn't make money it's not Pokemon go it's not Pokemon masters it's not sword and shield it's not the 56 percent revenue that is there plushies that they ship everything cook here which is like two things do you do you put something into the game to make PTC Gio money or do you just like do you just bite the bullet and keep it free but just make it significantly better so more people play your game or just do like just I don't do both just make it better like make it a better game I don't they this this product has been around for eight years it's on Windows it's a Windows app it's a Mac OS F it's on it's on iPad OS and it's on android tablets but of course with anything Android you can side load it there is no iOS app there is no switch app they have never they do have in game tournaments but they're super simple they're like you three opponents whatever that is like quarter semi-finals and you get tickets there's a lot of things that they need to answer / get right so in the press release specifically it says the TCG competitors will qualify for the pokémon trainer clubs through the ranking also just a heads up your ranking has always been hidden you're the elo and TCO is is hidden on the Jun leaderboards standard format in the trading card game and it doesn't really say much else so like currently in the trading card game they have like a ticket system and you can earn tickets and then you cash in those tickets to participate in like those little tournaments I just mentioned but what if you don't have tickets what if you're like what if you are a player that has only played locally and you have like a community that you play TCG oweth but now you want to compete because this is the only way to compete how are you supposed to get cards without like trading other people well you buy packs and then you get the codes and then you you put the codes in that very painful laborious process of entering codes then like hope you get the cards you need or like I mean the realistic thing to do is like you redeem a bunch of codes then instead of opening the packs you trade the packs because the packs are worth more closed than they are open so like right now I just opened up PTC geo so if you want to do a standard match so they allow each each one of these tournaments have eight people obviously I'm assuming this new tournament will be bigger it costs 8 tickets to enter the match your reward is if you come in first place you get you get six pack booster packs you come and you also get four 100 coins which is a different currency they use you can use coins to buy booster packs so 200 coins is a booster pack you come in second place you get two booster packs 100 coins and then if you come in third place you get 100 coins and two booster packs sorry second place gets four booster packs and then if you come fifth through eight you get like 50 coins so 1/4 of a booster I have 76 tickets which I don't know what the bath is that's like ten tournaments there's not a also a reliable way to get sort of like tickets so if I burn through all these tickets that's ten tournaments that I could participate in now and then like how am I getting more tickets are they switching the lot do I have to like play ladder earn tickets then take those tickets to participate in the tournament to get points or is the tournament just opened there's like a lot here that there's a lot of unanswered questions compared to like sword and shield and compared to pokken tournament that's that's happening there is no way to give ptc geo money the you have coins you earn coins by playing matches you can cash in those coins for packs you can go to Target or Walmart and you can buy a pack of cards for four dollars and twenty-nine cents and you can open it and get a digital pack which will have different cards and you could maybe trade those cards in like the trading area but if you've ever been on any online trading area it is nothing but scams or you can go to eBay this is another problem so like it's against P TCG oh it's against the Terms of Service that no one ever reads we talk about this all the time with like Pokemon go how you're only supposed to have one one account and stuff but it is technically against the Terms of Service and Pt cgo to pay physical money for cards so I can't go to will and say will I saw you open up on your stream to full art Reshiram charizard's I don't have any booster packs or anything to put to play and we're not friends in this situation I will give you I will PayPal you $10 to send those cards to me that is against TOS well I am giving you the all right giving up Reggie's art for $10 D 10 bucks is getting you nothing but what's not against TOS is you can technically go to eBay or or like a website look we'll stuffing court rollin tote and you can say I would like a hundred code cards for $80 so I'm paying 80 cents a code card it was like a hundred code cards and then they mail it to you or they email it to you and then you enter them into the game and technically that's not against TOS because you're not buying an item that already exists in the game because you have not entered that item into the game but once you get the items then you entered in the game and then that's okay but there's like there's literally not a way and maybe because it ruins the marketplace for me to just say like hey P TCG oh can I just buy a hundred packs for real money so I can open these packs and build decks there's not you have to buy either code cards or you have to buy and the only people winning from the code cards I'd like the sellers right it's like when games upsells use games it's not like Nintendo sees a copy it when game stop sells a copy a heart all used copy of heartgold SoulSilver so like somebody at a card shop is opening a hundred packs they're selling the cards individually and then they're selling the code cards so they're like kind of double dipping which is like fine I don't have a problem with that but like I want to give you my like let me give you my money to make PTC geo better because I want to play more PTC Gio and it is a bad application it's just not great yeah it's it's all about this like bizarrely contrived secondary market that they don't even want to acknowledge exists and yet they continue to fuel right like they hey like in Pokemon masters they have it where you can you can't spend a certain amount of money is that about right Greg like like you can only spend whatever 200 only 200 dollars a month or something and Pokemon masters cuz it yells at you that you spent too much money yeah there's a cap if they're if they're worried about that I don't do it like they already like pry it like PTC geo is older significantly older than Pokemon go and significantly older than masters and they have tons of children that is way easier in my opinion to spend money in the app store and buy coins for Pokemon go or buy gems for Pokemon masters and I guess they would have to build a back-end to accept money and then they would have to handle refunds if you know little Timmy grabbed mom's credit card punched it in bought a thousand coins or whatever I heard Squarespace could set me up with a payment portal they're worried about but are they still stuck in this mindset of we're scared to take my truck microtransactions you're already doing it in two extreme we popular games even if PT she geo was slightly more expensive than eBay so I and that always depends right like sometimes the code is 80 cents some kinds that sometimes the code is like a dollar 25 but that's still way cheaper than paying 4 bucks and then getting really bad pulls and yeah and being like I'm not I don't I don't I'm sick of these physical cards I just want to play in PT cgo cuz that's because I can get a game at any point I don't know even if it was like 2 bucks to get a digital booster pack in PT cg.o I would almost just do that just for the pure sake of convenience it's really kind of annoying to like order 100 codes off eBay and then just copy and paste 100 codes in like it's easy boring and it makes me feel like an accountant I'll pay for convenience and I would rather give my money to PT cgo so PTC joke becomes better than to give it to some dude on ebay who no offense to them he delivers the codes pretty quickly but I got no relationship with that guy like I do with with an actual Pokemon product I am very curious of how this is going to work and hopefully this makes PTC Gio better but man if it takes some four months to fix a card I don't know what they're gonna do in the next 14 days it's it's just gonna be a very ptc Gio oriented tournament and you know you're just gonna have to shift your meta for what that can accommodate and because it's like an official tournament - that is does that even introduce a huge new loophole of cheating or something like oh yeah especially for all the Android people that have like hacked I mean this was like a huge problem in Vanguard zero right that that games been out for what a month and a half and people have already but I mean let me not despair at Android users but obviously you can only do it on Android but people have already hacked it to get Auto wins yeah just like once you there's I mean that actually there's not even anything to gain from playing Bankart zero so now it's gonna be even worse because when there is something to gain then people are gonna have more incentive to hack the game or yeah like I would love to be I would love to like sit down with somebody who who said okay we're about to do a tournament P tzgo and like look at that person and say what walk me through person who is decided to do this tournament and for the record I'm it's very cool that they're doing a tournament but to sit down and say okay how do you expect a player to get enough cards and to build a deck for this tournament what does that look like to you like what is your what is the the customer path are you recommending like they need to go to Target and buy a bunch of packs are you recommending that like they should get an ET be open the packs not or claim the digital packs and not open the packs and trade them on the marketplace what do you want your customer to do at this point because it's not like you always we're doing tournaments it's not like this is brand new this is this is a tournament to qualify or the players Cup which me no for more or less maybe not as important as an actual championship but because of how weird this year is it is you know the substitute for an actual championship like what is what is the workflow you expect so I would say in their defense the one thing that kind of probably if I was imagining myself being in that decision-making room is they basically said you know we want to hold a tournament what do we have available well that's what we have right rather than having no tournament at all let's have a tournament with what we have and we know it's not the best but you know it's better than nothing so let's go forward with that it's just the amount of barriers with starting off in PTC Gio's is it's very high well I don't think they're expecting anybody to come from zero for this you dumped a bunch of money and to eBay codes or just go to Tower clean house and hope you get good poles well I mean the real secret is to become a successful twitch streamer and then people just give you codes and trade you yards because they're like I just want to be part of that person your success like you so the TCG tournament it starts in June or July the TCG tournament starts in June and you have to get enough rank by doing the little tournaments that cost tickets which we don't know how to get tickets yet I mean I got one ticket for logging into PTC geo four days in a row I got one ticket mostly these tournaments cost eight tickets to enter so you have to use tickets this is as far as we know unless they change it or unless I misunderstood you have to use tickets to participate in these tournaments you win the tournaments they give you a higher elo they pick the top 256 elo from respective regions and then they move on to the final thing which would be in August or whatever or July they said double elimination bracket so what is the double elimination you lose twice in your app yeah it's not single elimination and there and we're just learning about this and the 14th of May yes and they said that this is gonna start in June and they're releasing an expansion in June and there's probably an overlap of people who are excited for sword and shield DLC and people who liked the Pokemon Trading Card Game I don't expect the entire the entire tournament to last the entire month of June it's just extraordinary times so you have to you know think outside the bun yeah none of this is like I'm very happy they're doing all of this it's just very fast yeah it seems like a very short turnaround time for everybody involved I'm just I feel like when June starts there's gonna be like here's our new way of getting cards so you can rebuild your decks or something like something because have to know that that's a problem or are they just are they just feel like nope everybody's starting over from scratch make what you make what you can get anything that is uh it's like slightly before team up it's like legal and then I mean the the the nice here's the the nicest thing about PTC geo is as long as the card isn't physically digitally broken in the game again this is this is against Terms of Service but if you were to go to ebay you could buy a digital Jirachi for $15 and then somebody will add your ptc geo name and send it to you I'm not advising anyone to do that but that's how much Jirachi is worth about digital Jirachi is worth about 15 bucks and so you need like 3 2 to 3 Jirachi x' in a deck so that's $45 just to be at a competitive level as everyone else talk about barriers to have competitive but they are releasing I believe near the end of this month they're releasing to battle boxes and these battle boxes one of them comes with Jirachi physical but the code card in the battle box will match all the cards in the deck and I believe one is a zekrom Zekrom pikachu Tag Team deck and one is a restaurant Charizard Pikachu Dec or sorry Russia just Russia rim charges are no Pikachu Russia Ram Charizard and then Zekrom Pikachu and they both have complete decks so I think each one is like $25 and they come with all the good cards all those good cards or tournament legal and the code card should give you the same deck in the game and so that actually helps with some of the issue of like oh I need Jirachi is in order to play but that still doesn't maybe that maybe that's actually the go-to maybe they're like you know what you know if you've never played the Pokemon Trading Card Game and you need some cards we suggest our customers buy this battle box which will probably sell out I'm sure and we would suggest them for them to buy some digit weeks suggest for them to buy the battle box at Target and we suggest for them to buy an e TB or some booster packs and then they have the framework of a deck two really good decks and we would suggest them to trade for the other cards are missing just like in real life maybe that's actually the the thought process but if you're not keeping tabs on this if you're not listening to this podcast we're going to TCG websites you probably would have no clue that this battle box is coming and I think it comes out on the 23rd I maybe maybe that maybe that's the plan I mean it doesn't answer the actual how the tournaments gonna run but it's a whole new world we live in oh there you go too long didn't read I really want PT cgo to be better and I hope maybe this is the first step towards that future I were total izing that dream that that this pivot is the start of the Pokemon company really giving direwolf digital the benefit of the doubt to make PTC geo better yes okay when we come back it'll be the interview with Aaron he's his thoughts on the current meta of the sword and shield TC VGC how to get into it his thoughts on it compared to past meadows and all that stuff so we'll be right back [Music] [Music] all right we are back from our break and we are here with aaron zhang AKA cybertron VGC how are you Aaron I'm good thank you for having me here thank you for being on this has been like a like a five-year endeavor to get you on the ship long overdue man yeah well I'm excited that you're here if somebody doesn't know who you are real quick or however long you want but what do you do who are you my name is Aaron Zayn but I go by Cybertron and I am a competitive VGC player commentator and content creator so I've been playing VGC since 2008 actually and throughout my years of competing I've won five regional championships two national championships and third at the World Championships in 2013 and in more recent years I've transitioned over to becoming a commentator for the Pokemon company so if you've ever watched the International Championship or World Championship streams I've commented in many of those events including the World Finals in 2016 2018 and 2019 and I also have a youtube channel that passed 100,000 subscribers with sword and shield coming out so I mean content there every day trying to educate people and help them improve in the game you went through the whole College thing I know because that was like a lot of up and down with your YouTube of like schools now YouTube's on hold but have you transitioned to casting slash playing competitive full time or do you have like a nine-to-five job that you keep secret yeah I'm actually finishing up my last semester of school so I did five years of undergrad to get two different bachelor degrees from two different schools and I mean literally the last week of my program my final exam is on Wednesday and then officially graduating and I think a week and a half so after that I'm actually gonna be working full time and I'm not gonna be doing content stuff but I'll actually be working in gaming and eSports working for an investment group called axiomatic and they actually are most known for owning Team Liquid which is one of the premier eSports team so out there we'll be doing a lot of investing in different companies like Team Liquid as well as strategy work for the companies that were invested in so I'm really excited about that mainly because it's just a mix of you know taking my passion for gaming but also taking everything that I've learned from school in my previous you know internship and job experiences and really combining you know also I still be will be doing Pokemon stuff but I always like doing you know like commentating and playing more as like a sight thing rather than as a full-time career sure things I don't blame you consecrating is a very competitive yeah absolutely being of competitive VGC and sword and shield it was a pretty big deal I think no one would argue that the VG season was going incredibly well until the pandemic happened but how do you feel about the VGC specifically in sword and shield it's been amazing I think we saw so many great things that came out of sword and shield I think the main thing is like the quality of life changes have just made it so much easier for players to get into the game so for example rental teams are super accessible so now it's very easy for anyone to just try out and play with any team that they might be interested in what's published online in addition it's a lot easier to get competitive Pokemon in-game now through the combination of like nature or mints I should say it's a lot easier to breed as well so I just everything makes it more accessible and I think that was kind of the biggest barrier ten trees for people that were interested in getting into the game and yeah I think overall this format seemed to be very fun for a lot of people as well meet myself included it's the most fun I've had playing VGC in a couple of years and I think because there are so many you know Pokemon that are very viable and strong so many different strategies that could work this year was really shaping up to be one of the best years of VGC so obviously it's a shame like the rest of the season is canceled but you know that was really the only correct move to make and we're still seeing people play a ton of BGC online there's been a lot of grassroots efforts to keep the scene alive so I think it's a very very we have a very very bright future and I feel like sword and shield introduced so much light made it have so much potential one of the main reasons we brought you on was to kind of dig a little bit deeper in VGC and whatnot because you have a really good oversight of it but before we get to that how do you feel about sword and shield as a whole we talked about sales numbers last weeks and it you know it's sold 17 million copies and that's on top of you know there was a lot of bad press when it would was a fish officially announced so yeah that didn't seem to you know the whole boycott sort and she'll didn't really seem to pan out with 17 million copies being sold but how do you feel about it personally yeah that's a great question I've always been a competitive player first but you know I still enjoy pointing the games just like casually just to run through them and I enjoyed sword and shield a lot more I would say than for something like ultra saw no moon which was probably my least favorite game of all time mainly because of how similar was the Sun and Moon but Sun and Moon I also like I felt like I didn't like it super much I wasn't I was more indifferent about it I guess but sorting showed I actually really enjoyed for example raids I had a ton of fun doing with a lot of my friends I thought it was a great way to interact with the community and like one of my favorite thing about raids is that like it's great for competitive players but I have a lot of like friends who play Pokemon casually they're not really interested in competitive but they were still interested in doing braids just to get some cool Pokemon or you know some items so raids I thought were really cool I liked the in-game experience a lot I thought the wild area was super exciting as well so I definitely had fun playing the in-game and I think being able to customize your character actually was one thing that I missed a lot so to see that return I think was also super awesome and at the end of the day the experience was super fun and I even did it you know didn't mind doing stuff like grinding to get competitive Pokemon or whatnot whereas it might've been a little bit more frustrating in previous games so for me I enjoyed it mainly because of like raids and just the interaction I was able to have with friends who maybe played more casually you bringing up raids that brings up one of the biggest mechanics of a sword and shield which makes it different than competitive you know in Sun and Moon or X&Y or whatnot but Dynomax Pokemon Giganta max Pokemon that is a you know in in the competitive sense the Pokemon company loves doubt doubles they have never really supported singles and so you see you know great of what you said earlier like you see you know non-official stuff like smoke on you know they went the extreme to ban Dynomax and you know before that was a huge thing I heard before people even got their hands on the game or you know big Pokemon are dumb and we want Megas we want Z moves back this is a loaded question but let's wait how do you feel about Dynomax as a mechanic competitively yeah since I only played VGC exclusively my experience with that is only really envy GC and I am a pretty big fan of it in BGC I think it is very dynamic it has a lot to lagaye and I do think there are some things that could have been like fine-tuned about it for example I think it would have been a lot more interesting of a mechanic or I guess it's not interesting but if you like decrease the power creep by making an item like life orb not viable on Dynomax mom's weakness policy it's part of the reason why Dynomax is so threatening in BGC there's so many setups with weakness policy but in general I do think it is a good mechanic and I've enjoyed playing with it a lot and I think one thing that makes it fun - is that like seeing really good players and how they use Dynomax is super interesting if you look at like the top format replays from a lot of the tournaments we had before all this stuff started happening like you would often see six different pokemon Dynomax throughout the course of a best-of-three you know someone just chooses a different pokemon and dynamics in every game so I like that it makes like every pokemon somewhat viable um I don't think it's the perfect mechanic but I personally enjoyed playing with it that being said I do think that it feels like it was kind of made for doubles whereas I can see why players weren't very happy about it in single battles yes sir do you think do you think Pokemon would just be a better game if they didn't have a gimmick like Dynomax or megazor z moves or do you think that like pretty much this is needed yeah I think you know part of the thing that makes them able to market their games with each new generation is the introduction of something crazy right so having Dynomax as a advertising tool I think is one a smart idea so it's interesting because you know having thought about this before it's like for competitive players if you pulled them a lot of them probably wouldn't mind a meta game for example without Dynomax but from the company's perspective I think it adds a lot of value to have a crazy mechanic like this with each generation and it just adds a lot of value when you say market your game I think like for me personally I'd be fine playing competitively with or without dynamics but from the company's perspective I why they introduce one of these mechanics every generation and I've honestly enjoyed dynamics more Lindsey moves and Megas so I have no opposition's yeah I think now maybe if people weren't paying attention closely like you know the Pokemon company has been consistently consistent about removing features and always introducing new features do you think that like well I guess you said you like this better than Z moves or mega Pokemon but was that specifically like a reason you didn't like Sun and Moon was because of the Z move format and mega Pokemon like a thing that really drew you into like the X&Y format yeah I think for me as a competitive player always basically play whatever R is put in front of me so I don't think I was strongly opposed to Z mousse or omegas but for example I didn't like Megas as much as Dynomax because with Megas there were only a couple that were like super viable and like they were just way above the pool for the rest the Pokemon it felt like there wasn't great balance so for example like Salomon's chars or Kangaskhan Gengar Mawile they were just kind of on another tier and then you would so many ones that were like kind of cool but just never really saw any use and for Z moves I think the moves were just staring because like you could have something that's super strong for example like curtana and Landers with all these like super strong legendary Pokemon with the Z move they could just like you know get this really really strong one-hit ko and I don't play around those options were scary but part of what I liked Dynomax is because it makes things bulkier and so I kind of like playing out formats that are a little bit more slow and drawn out and Dynomax works both ways you can you know very easily snowball games with it as well but I like that you can turn any pokemon and make it significantly bulkier basically just by Dino maxing it so I didn't like I guess per se disliked megazor Z was but I just enjoy playing with Dynomax I think a little bit more but those mechanics didn't really I think effect like whether I liked the game or the in-game experience it was more just about like competitive battles would you want like a black and white format back where everyone's running different gems well that was the big mechanic right in black and white it was yeah right yeah I wouldn't be opposed honestly like I I think if I could pick an ideal format played any non Dynomax games like in this generation but I feel like this generation has a lot of potential because there's so many equal pokemon in the pokédex so a lot of top players actually recently been saying yeah if we didn't have Dynomax in this format it would've been like the perfect format and at the end of the day you know people's opinions on formats are super super subjective but yeah I think I wouldn't mind seeing gents come back at the end of the day I'll just play what I'm giving but Dynomax I think I've enjoyed the most next to the very very old Gen 5 formats with gems in 2012 and 13 so to bring up like the current format a lot of that is specifically because there's not 900 some Pokemon there's only 400 so this is like a huge national next thing right I'm sorry I have to bring up national dex because it's sorta chilled so like Masuda stood on stage during the e3 announcement and they said you know two of the reasons why we're cutting Pokemon one is for animations and people can argue whether the tailwhip animation is the same or the hyperbeam animation is new which i think it is but the other reason they said the more important reason at least why for you is they said we're cutting Pokemon to make competitive better and a lot of people thought that was a lie because you know they saw you know they didn't play the game yet but do you think that cutting Pokemon made competitive better yeah it's interesting right because it's like in whoever makes the ruleset has the power theoretically to just like create an arbitrary band list but I will say let all the Pokemon that we ended up with I didn't create it for a really really healthy format a meta game and I think lat I am a little bit scared of what the future meta games are gonna entail up especially because we know for example like you know the legendaries are gonna come back into the game so for me this year was just so so good and I this kind of speaks to like accessibility of the game but I think one reason that people have always been kind of hesitant to watch BGC or play BGC is because a lot of the public's perception is that everyone just uses the same like legendary Pokemon and using strategies and for anyone that I keep the follows VGC you'll know that even if you have two people using like the exact same 16 like six Pokemon it can be matches gonna be super super dynamic and there's so much skill involved even when people are using the same Pokemon but I generally like the public especially if you look at like the comments on like a World Finals everyone's like oh my god I can't believe they're using the same legendary Pokemon it's so cheap like you know this isn't the way to play and part of what made this year I think more interesting was that you know there were no legendary Pokemon around and so you might see some of the same Pokemon but in general I feel like a lot of people who don't follow competitive have this like negative perception towards legendary Pokemon so I think one thing I liked about this format was that there were none of those and honestly I would be down for VGC to like never include legendary Pokemon again just because that one small change I feel like really affects how the general public who might not follow a competitive really perceive the scene but um yeah I mean going back to your question I think competitive was very very good this year and yeah I don't know how intentional was for them and like when they were picking Pokemon and make the Pokedex but everything that did end up making it through I think resulted in a healthy format and that was super fun to watch and play in then there was this hive mindset of like oh see they don't care about competitive because GMAC Stretton all sets up stealth rock but in reality if you actually watch competitive no one really is using stealth hmm and then you have these players that are like well if they compared it cared about competitive why are they allowing alterna crows more why they're allowing mega rayquaza correct so do you think that's like part of that perspective is like they have let these powerful Pokemon be in the game before yeah definitely I think a lot of people's perceptions often get warped because they either look at like a 2015 is the best example of this where like seven of the top eight teams from the World Championships had like Cresselia Heatran and mungus Landers and King it's gone it was all Japanese players and everyone always like points little graphic of the top eight teams from that specific term and they're like yeah this is a great example of how like undiversified this is why it's like not a good competitive game which like that always bothers me a lot for two reasons one if you look at the teams just beyond the top eight that year there were so many diverse pokemon and teams used it just so happened that the japanese players made like a good meta game called that tournament and second of all those like players played immensely well with those teams and like even the mirror matches were incredibly incredibly skillful so I think and then and then you know they also play sometimes look at like 2016 or like oh my god like like you said mega rayquaza primal Kyogre primal Groudon like what the heck is going on at the end of the day competitive players are gonna play whatever is given to them so you know we don't get some much say on what we want the competitive format to be we're basically told hey play this and as competitive players we're always just gonna play what we're asked to play in the VGC you know rule set yeah I don't know I'm personally very scared about like things like Lander is being allowed back in mainly because I feel like we're really on the right direction and this format was super promising but if they do allow these legendaries back in I'm gonna play right because I'm a competitive player and a concentrator I'm gonna do whatever I'm gonna follow the rule set why I have to play because like if you want to protest then you don't play well then you're not going to torment you're not really doing anything right another complaint part of the the decks it's tough and I think this this kind of gets forgotten about but they this was a huge complaint when the game came out but they cut over 70 different moves and specifically I think out of the 70 I can really only remember like what hidden power return pursuit but I mean do you think this was the right move do you think cutting you know 70 plus moves or competitive for the series was the right decision uh in the end the move cuts don't seem to feel super relevant in BDC I mean like return toxic and hidden power were used previously but I don't think anyone was like really complaining in bgca let those moves no longer exist it might be different in singles play honestly because I know what Cox sake is like a very very big deal in singles as is something like hit empower him how was used a fair amount in BGC as well but yeah I don't know I guess I'm pretty indifferent about those moves being cut that I don't feel like it's really affected VGC and I think like once again players would have played regardless of whether they were caught or not caught but in the end he doesn't feel like it made any big substantial difference and I don't know if they ended up cutting it whether they specifically said it was for competitive reasons or just because of like coding mechanics but at the end of the day I guess I haven't given it much thought because I don't feel like I really miss them nor do I feel like they were needed so yeah no no up sites are downsides at least relevant to VGC I would say regarding those Togekiss seems to be the purse the Pokemon that kind of rig rose to the top and in sword and shield here mm-hmm that is Togekiss like the new Landorus in the sense of everyone's gonna point at something and say look at everyone just as Togekiss I guess to an extent I don't know I mean they function a little bit differently and I think like if people that don't understand the game competitively wanted to just point to like the most used Pokemon then yeah like Togekiss and drag a folder like the easy targets III do think drag revolt could have been toned down a little bit it's just so fast and weakness policy makes it super powerful as well as life orb and the fact that like both of those are so viable makes it scary I mean the r8 main reason like pokemon white omeka sand dragon whole Drusilla very top is because they're super good both in in Dynomax and outside of dynamics but specifically in dynamics like you have these really bulky pokemon they're also able to just distribute so much damage and both of those for example get access to a flying-type attack so they can use max airstream to boost the speed and one thing that's really important in BGC of speed control and you know dynamaxx max moves affects also affect your partner so you can use max airstream with either trouble kiss or drag opposed to boost but that Pokemon speed and the partner Pokemon speed that's kind of the reason I'm like one of the other reasons why these Pokemon are so good is because you can run so many different sets for example Oh Togekiss you see really bulky sets but you also see really offensive sets I've seen like five or six different items being run on it with different abilities as well skillful and super luck is common but you also have like the very very Lum berry so many different items that are just viable and it's similar with drag repulse as well I guess your question was comparing it to Landorus and I don't know how I would say I feel like it's better to have something like Toby kisser drivers will be common than Landorus mainly because once again people's perception of just like a legendary Pokemon like there's like a negative stigma I feel like associated with them what do you think the worst move in the VGC is and why is it a lie switch yeah actually if there's one move I could remove from this generation you'd probably be a lie switch mainly because a lot about VGC is you know making informed predictions and plays based on what your opponent has but they for some reason just gave a lie switch to so many different pokemons so like it is very it's nearly impossible to predict like an ally switch from something that doesn't run it typically for example Rotom and to kiss don't really run a lie switch but you could tuck it in and it just like feels super frustrating to go up against something like it's very hard to you know see coming and I think like the move itself is also like you can just spam it as well like I would have liked it if you can't use it consecutively I'm just I'm not sure why they decided to give so many Pokemon access to it but I do think Alice which is like just not very healthy because it induces like a lot of like random guessing that I feel like shouldn't be included in the game and maybe that's like different based off how your philosophy of the competitive game is but Alice which was one I think that's probably the biggest one to me also like rock slide being able to flinch is a big deal because it's already such a good move and like they still have the same flinch chance although it's not nearly as prevalent as saying like Flandre spamming rocks like from back in the day but yeah I think you're you say now a switch is an accurate one for sure do you think that like overall there's too much randomness and VGC I feel like a lot of times the maybe maybe that's intentional I like like I've played a I've played a lot of the Pokemon Trading Card Game competitively and a lot of the competitive in the TCG really came down to I just needed one more turn yeah and when I've I've dabbled in VGC or when I've watched me VGC it's always like oh if they just got that coin flip right they would have won do you do you think that's like too much not enough maybe it is designed to be like oh well I heads or tails I would have won that I think if you don't know anything about VGC it can seem like a lot of coin flipping an orangey and it certainly is sweet extent but I always compare VGC to poker where any top player can lose on a given day but conversely someone starting out has the potential to be like the world's best and for example like I follow chess and chess is a game where I'm just never gonna be able to beat like the world's best player ever but with a game like Pokemon there VGC the best player will win the majority of the time but the fact is that you give the opportunity for someone who might not be as good as them to beat them and I think that's exciting you know that's part of the draw if I you know I'm talking to a bunch of people that just started playing - they're like you know I went to my first tournament and I want some games and that was exciting to me and in a lot of other competitive games where it's purely skill based like you wouldn't see that really happen ever but I I do think like if I could tone down some RNG and VGC I would for example I'd get rid of like the like fries I think is just a terrible mechanic that shouldn't be in the game I get rid of like flinching on moves like rockslide and I would also maybe change how something like sleep warps for example and reduce like some of the variants but I do think let a little bit of variance is not bad for a competitive game and I think like there's a reason why every time you look at a tournament like whoever wins these major tournaments are excellent excellent players and you need to get a little bit lucky to do well in a tournament but you also need to play phenomenally well so I think RNG is often a lot less relevant than people think and one thing that prohibits people from getting better is blaming their losses purely on luck when in reality because there's so many decisions to be made in competitive VGC there's always almost always I should say something better you could have done whether it was a better move to reduce the variance later on in the game for example like sometimes people will point to losing because they missed an attack well you know top players often evaluate and be like ok was there anything I could have done so that I didn't even need to use an inaccurate attack whether it was in the actual game or in the team building process so there's so many factors including team building and playing but it's very hard to just break down a loss solely to bad luck and sometimes you will have those losses right sometimes you do get really really unlucky and there truly is nothing better let you could have done but I think one thing that makes people improve rapidly is when they actually sit down and value 8 their losses let they think is due to bad luck and I understand to say like 90 plus percent of the time there was something better that could have been done either in the team building process or the battling process to have mitigated that so I think Pocomoke would probably still see some less rng like freeze I think should just be reduced I would probably change like the sleep mechanics just a little bit but in general I think some variance is healthy for a competitive game because then you don't get the same games over and over again so if somebody's like listening and they're like inspired by what you just said like how do how do they even get into competitive at this point besides like the general like watch a YouTube video and rent a team like like you are right in there there needs to be practice there needs to be evaluation but like how how does one even do that yeah I think the first thing is just knowing the top resources knowing where to go so you know there are a lot of great resources out there like tower in Victory Road these websites have a lot of articles and team reports like and help people get started out and rental teams as we've talked about there's also a lot of great content creators online both on YouTube and twitch so watching top players is always you know just a great way to improve but on a more deep level what I recommend to people who want to get into VGC is team building is really really important but it's an art in VGC and it's hard and I think a lot of players often get discouraged because you know they lose as a consequence of not knowing like fundamental team mechanics and so they're at a disadvantage because of their teams so I always recommend people once they're starting out to first like try to understand the fundamentals by playing with the team what is proven to be successful so whether that's a rental team from like a you know world champion or just something that seems very consistent hard shirt room is actually something I often recommend because it's relatively easy to use and it helps you show the fundamentals of the game but yeah if you're like getting into it play games try all the team that is you know good let's fundamentally strong and also don't play just for the sake of like playing games like I think it's really important to evaluate each of your wins and losses every time I lose a game I'll ask myself why would I lose that game and what could I have done better to have won the game and often there are two answers to that it's either making better plays perhaps I made a play that was too risky perhaps I made a play that was just like a prediction but it was a prediction that wasn't gonna work out most of the time like evaluate that sometimes it's your game play sometimes is that your team limited you and then so you have to ask yourself okay what could I've improved about my team but you know a lot of people when they play any competitive game likes to just keep grinding games but it's more important to learn from the game so I would say focus more on like especially losses look at the losses look at why you lost and try to answer that if you can answer it that's great because then you can approach you know towards improving and but if you're just playing games for the sake of playing games often you're not going to improve very rapidly in my opinion yeah I'm not like a personal experience I would say I lost because that was because I don't have a counter to laparis mmm-hmm is is that a thing and VGC like do you just see one pokemon and you go I can't beat that one pokemon but if they don't have it I'm good yeah I think that goes into the team building or if your team is struggling against something like every team should theoretically have a decent answer against anything so especially the top meta Pokemon right like part of what makes a really good team is that it gives you at least neutral to positive matchups against anything you could go up against now of course there's so many Pokemon in the game let you maybe can't cover for everything but if you can cover first say like the most like the 30 most common Pokemon and have some answer to it then at least you'll be able you'll most likely have answers to everything below that as well and sometimes maybe you do run into like one thing that makes teams the best teams really good is let top players come up with like really crazy sets that are creative that no one's all coming I think 2014 Pachirisu is often pointed to because that was something that very few people had on their radar and that's something where maybe in in throughout the course of that tournament people watch them they're like oh god I just don't have an answer against Pachirisu but that's why you know the best players are the way they are they're able to find these crazy Pokemon that work and make them you know to a strongest of their ability but I think if you're staring down a common Pokemon you're like oh my team just doesn't have a way to beat that then you need to go back to blue team building process and reevaluate what you can swap for it so for example if lapis is something that people are struggling with you want to look at okay what is ways to hit it for super effective damage electro types are easy to point to and then you want to evaluate okay what electric types fit with my team Rotom wash for example is often used because it resists both lappers this main types you use like nastyplot which is very common as well so that's why team-building is an art the best teams will have good answers against everything and I basically give you options so that you're not just struggling against something the entirety of the game with mints bottle caps all these things to make VG cz so much easier over the years do you think there's something else that we're missing that would even make the barrier to entry even lower at this point that's a really good question I think having something like a you know we have bottle caps for thirty-one IVs but having something like you'd make your IV like zero would be really nice because trick room you know teams often like using that and all the most optimal team in theory has the zero attack IV if you're not a physical attacker to reduce like confusion damage nothing something like that would be good I know one thing that they actually are doing now is like raids where the most common Pokemon are actually like the competitive Pokemon that you can get so I think like more of that would be really good especially like earlier all when people are just getting into it because now we're like what six months into sort she'll write having that earlier on is great but I think like grades are excellent being able to give away high IB Pokemon immediately is great I think mints were much needed I guess maybe another capsule where you could get like hidden abilities those like I think hidden abilities and zero Ivy's are like the last two things I feel like they could cover but I do think the gap has really really been covered the gap at least from like last generation with this generation and I was like super super accessible so any other changes would be a lot smaller than say going into this generation we talked about some moves that that you didn't really care for like sleep mechanics flinch Ally switch that kind of stuff is there like held items that you feel like need to be pulled from the game or that are just too powerful I mean you brought up weakness policy a lot as a very powerful item yeah I think it's less about the item and I guess more about the interaction with Dynomax I think like Dynomax was a really cool mechanic and I mean I'm fine playing in a meta game or like life or maybe just policy exists on Dynomax moms but I think like it would be cool for example if like weakness policy didn't work on a Dynomax mom maybe like it could work before you Dynomax which forces you to attack it and for that but want to take potentially more damage because you know you can only use it before Dynomax I think like making life or just not work on Dynomax Pokemon would be an interesting interaction I don't think the items inherently are broken is just about how they interact with like Dynomax specifically there isn't anything that makes me be like wow like this is just so brought busted like this I'm going to play the game um you know that's like the main day at least it feels like everything like has some answer but I think the biggest ones let biggest offenders people point to it wit Dynomax in DGC are definitely like life orb weakness policy and then like scope lens Togekiss can be frustrating play against because you get to critical hit 50% of the time with super luck but yeah I don't know I I think it's like not all of those are at least like decently chapped it's not like the worst case but if I had it my way I would probably like reduce the interactions they have with Dynomax specifically in an ideal world in an in an ideal world is there a Pokemon or a few Pokemon that you would wish that would just somehow be better in competitive whether it's being held back by ability or stats or move pool that's a good question um I'd have to give that some thought I think like Glaceon is one of my all-time Pokemon so I'd have to root for that mainly because I mean it's pretty strong overall and it's actually used somewhat in the format it's not like completely under completely not used but I'd like to see it be a little bit more viable I mean Empoleon and scissor aren't in the game but those are two of my all-time favorite Pokemon said I prefer I think Flygon is like a you know hometown favor for so many people that land they're like always kind of fall short relative to the other Dragon types I wish they could like because wagon is such a cool Pokemon so it has such an interesting well everyone thought I was gonna have a mega evolution as well and then they baited us and didn't give us a mega evolution for it so those are just something that jumped to mind all right Aaron well I don't want to eat up too much of your time I'm assuming your favorite Pokemon is still Rotom wash yeah I don't watch competitively but Piplup is I think my all-time just if I pick one Pokemon just cuz it's so cute and I like penguins alright awesome and now you you have your own youtube videos about teaching people to get in competitive you're streaming on Twitch so are those good resources for somebody who is never you know touch competitive but has always been interested to go to to dabble in yeah definitely I mean I think like trainer tower Victory Road Nimbus City Post are just some websites like if you go to get started you want to definitely check out the rental team sections as well Victory Road has as well stern actually they both have a lot of grassroots events as well so I'm just playing in those are good and yeah you can find me at Cybertron productions on YouTube at Cybertron BGC on Twitch I tried to be as educational and interactive as possible and my goal was really to just help us see you continue to grow try to be a you know easy way to get into the game but there's a lot of other really great content creators in Wolfie click is kind of the face of the community and he has a lot of entertaining videos but he's also just one of if not the best player ever really from the history of the game so he is definitely a great resources as well there are a ton of other great content creators that you can find online if anyone watching this is curious feel free to like DM me on Twitter Rock and happy refer you to all the list of them there's just so many out there nowadays but yeah in general it's a lot easier to get into VGC now than it was years ago and there are a lot of people working hard to try to make it more accessible to people so if you're interested in trying it out don't be afraid to and one piece of advice I always give to people starting out is that like losing is actually the best thing that can happen people get frustrated in any competitive game when they lose but the thing is that you only get to grow as a player when you are able to evaluate your losses and once you can see what you're doing wrong then you'll be able to improve thank you thank you for being on air and I really appreciate it any time thank you for having me why is there not pokemon snap too [Music] [Music] okay some easy news here real quick first bit is off Pokemon go live calm this is actually I mean I'm we could talk about we could turn this into a Pokemon go only podcast but but just some simple Pokemon good news just a heads up you probably saw this if you play pokemon go but there will be a community day at home again featuring seedot this is probably right this is probably not a pivot this is probably not something seedot was probably alright always planned for community yeah I think so yeah so still no snivy tepig or gosh wat it will be Sunday May 24th 11:00 to 5:00 so six hours again at home if you're lucky you may encounter shiny seedot they are doing another one dollar box you'll be able to access community exclusive special research that will include a three incense so probably that that itself is probably worth a dollar five golden raspberries that's the useless yep other rewards don't know what that is you can take snapshots to get something there will be another scam a box which is the fast the pay2win elite fast TM 30 ultra balls three incense three lucky eggs I still I don't think we'll ever no one can ever defend to me how be a lot of the elite TM is its elite ever finally get that lucky Mewtwo its shadow ball or whatever yeah well this is a fast one this is the fast move not the that's a charge move yeah that was last time this will be eat them three times the catcher HP incense will last for three hours so you only have to use two buddy Pokemon with a buddy level will bring you hot items such as pokeballs throughout the event I am surprised I've been streaming Pokemon go on Twitch a lot more recently I've been doing it every Tuesday night anytime there's one of these carvanha thing events I am so shocked constantly I get questions of like how does your how did your buddy bounce back a pokeball being good it's such a good animation it's a really good at yeah it's a really good surprise the first time it happened because I had no warning but then I sort of I pieced that puzzle together people still not playing with their buddies I guess I don't know even I did the math because I think you need 30 hearts in total to get to the these two heart thing it's either 30 or 40 but if you were to do the bare minimum which is give your buddy 3 berries and then while you're doing that Pettitte and then take a picture but you know what I do no walking no battling no finding a new place you do the minimum of three hearts a day you can do from your bed you'll get there in like 10 to 12 days like it's yeah it's not it's not good to Muslim is that the buddy stuff is not catching pokémon and I play pokemon go to catch pokemon so you're catching pokémon any poker balls during these events they bring you pokeballs Oh Josh time they're bringing me plenty of pokeballs they're bringing me gifts now this is my new great thing yeah you get gifts on see it's a what three yeah just at the start of three I met overline I mean I'm in I'm in the middle of three with my Gardevoir the other thing here is maybe I don't know if Niantic is maybe seeing that people want to watch content related to go but they are saying are you participating in community at home playing at home doesn't mean you have to play alone tune in to our english-language youtube channel for our first-ever 24 hour community a livestream I don't know what this means join anytime between Saturday March May 23rd from 6:00 p.m. and Sunday May 24th 6:00 p.m. to watch seedot and other pokemon play in the wild you can also jump in the conversation the comments jokes fun and play together at home maybe it's like when we were looking at the forest I'm like it's gotta be just like this forest thing which is pretty cool I mean I'm in yeah I'm sure it's like what was the forest though it was like an hour loop but like every hour they like five seconds of something yeah I mean there was yes I mean they did it was 24 hours but there was there were things going on here and there but there was for the most part there was a loop it's just they inserted right things in between it wasn't like I don't know what a technological wizardry mimicking lead it was magic yeah so see doc community that's the thing get your free acorn full disclosure I am partnered with DNA who makes Pokemon masters minor masters update here Wally and Gallade are now in masters I don't have it yet and I'm very angry I believe Gregg loves the gen 3 I love the Wally a lot Wally is one of my favorite characters rat Kandra Wally in recent years had a Gardevoir they took it away from him give him a glade what there was it he got a glade for Oris when they yeah but like that's like his permanent thing now they'd yeah they reckoned him though cuz in in even an emerald he had go Gardevoir right but that was a different universe we're not in that universe anymore hmm that's right new users yes they also retcon you know pokemon gold and silver and the character's name was gold and soul silver they changed to Ethan now anytime they refer to that character it's always Ethan who is this gold you speak of who is who is this gold did you get your ho and silver I did I didn't I didn't do enough I didn't do it like once I got it I was sort of tired of the random stuff so I didn't power it up but I didn't really care about powering it up his fire isn't that great and at the it'll be around again I'll just do all the powering up later like I just I was out of I was out of manuals I don't really care about how oh but I did enough to get to get it I don't know what was about this event that I loved I made it to the 10th cool you like opening boxes I do I do and I don't it was a find that form of gambling fun so easy though to Autobot three times in the morning three times at night boom boom boom all these faxes yeah I mean the this the extra bonus point system is a nice addition it didn't I mean I did play I but but I would not remember this play Pokemon masters till about 1:00 in the afternoon and I was not gonna stay up for the reset but yeah it was a good event Blissey event is very mare yeah I don't it's just there's interesting knockout bliss he wants a day yeah it's not interesting I want Wally and I haven't holding it but how it was fun I just I've just not I'm not into mobile games right now so I just I played it but not a ton but I enjoyed what I played I just the random boxing is just not my jam final bit of news here is Giganta max pikachu is in raids until the well if you listen to this on monday they leave tonight you didn't get one yet even I got a Jaime dancer max Pikachu no I know what I like is the one who grow no no I was saying P cuz I like an alliance I have my hidden ability surfing Pikachu so they can be hidden ability I might do some more tomorrow morning some on vacation so I might wait I might try to get a couple more tomorrow morning I don't know I haven't decided I think my hidden ability there it was last thing for about a week after that we will get jiggy into max Eevee for a week and then after that we will get Giganta max me off for a week and then that'll bring us to June first which I don't 100% know what is gonna rotate in then but hey people like Pikachu's and v's and me else I am excited to hear a gigantic max Eevee scream yeah boy at me [Laughter] funniest thing was I when I was doing my wishing pieces I came across know I what was I bad like I was babbling a giggle and I brought a Vaporeon and you know the Vaporeon still has the original cry huh yeah but imagine that for what I really wish they would go in and the next game and just update all the cries yep they really just they've already done it with yeah boy and Pikachu just hit it across the board I bet me out would be next I thought if we're gonna change any pokemons cry it's gonna be me out next songs to screams that's right I'd be happy I'm actually surprised Devin than Charizard cry either yeah I just mmm it's the thing is is that it's really as we get new Pokemon and they make more complex cries its R it's so obvious I just wish they would update them I'm really this point with some of the new cries that they they're like there's like this fine line where they want to make new and better cries but they also want to try to make them not sound super far out from old stuff but man like when you like listen to Ricky DS cry and then you listened like piggies cry you're like one of these sucks in the Biddy and they got like cricket tunes is really good like they it seemed like they were like I can just update them yeah okay question of the week all right it's a quick and short one for you this time it's just another question of the week oh okay I told you is quick don't you wish it was another question of the week is that's my fun week yeah I can't believe she called out her boyfriend at the beginning of that song but well yeah that's a different era yep this is from Casey what are you currently working towards not necessarily Pokemon related example I am working towards learning web programming I'm writing another RPG and I'm working on Steven universe rules for glitter hurts right now how many RPGs are you like king of RPG I said that wasn't gonna write another one and then I started writing it so don't ask me I just started it it may go nowhere I may hate it but I started writing it what about you Steve what are your dreams and ambitions what she's I mean like trying to get things ready for our ten-year anniversary I'm already working on the song for the 10 year okay good I feel like it's sneaking up very fast I mean it's already June I read and I were planning on traveling this year but that obviously didn't work but hopefully more travel next year Pokemon and non Pokemon related travel very hard because twitch requires you to be live so often so maybe incorporating I are all travel which I personally like to watch and bring that to twitch in some capacity would be something I would like to work for late timing right now is uh not good it's a late night stream watch me watch propertybrothers IRL the worst show ever how about you bill what are you currently working towards besides becoming a bike master well I mean that's part of it so since the majority of my normal travel schedule for the year has been nuked into oblivion I am thinking through a way to do a bike packing tour Oh fun so somewhere yeah that I mean I specifically bought the bike that I bought because it is very versatile and can be set up for reasonable bike packing so that'll be cool you should buy Cup to Duluth but to see the colors I mean maybe at some point and I do want I mean I want to do an outdoorsy stuff this year right I wanted to get kayak from Lake Minnetonka to the Mississippi which I've been told is possible and also potentially getting into mountain biking which is a variant from the type of biking I've been doing already I just obviously I have a niche for fitness that's not getting scratched at the gym right now so I'm exploding out into all kinds of weird and bizarre areas well you know what can help you with your bike questions um Kickstarter no no no no that's not my jam but looking forward to Kickstarter into the future I you know my favorite kind of tabletop game is a deck builder yes so I've been working on a deck builder but it's more oriented towards like children young adults it's more education well focused but I mean that doesn't mean you couldn't have fun playing it you've changed well how dare you how dare you how to develop poison in your chemistry class I had a science kit I know but trouble you can get into it that thing no it's not it's it's if somebody were to know me well enough they'd they'd know what I'm I'm aiming towards um but yeah it's gonna take a lot of work so yeah just something I'm working on on the site besides you know my job that makes me money mm-hmm oh wow the week all right so last week's Pokemon was a reference to a 90s movie about things happening in the Amazon that might be scary to you a couple of jump scares if you're especially if you don't like snake animals except then pretend that it happened in the desert okay okay [Music] you were so close I'm completely Rodan effort cuz it's sand akanda sand Akhanda based on the fantastic no 1997 horror film anaconda um I didn't reference Nicki Minaj at all you wish probably for the best mercy opportunity for the best and also listeners if you now go look up for each of the sequels and watch them go down in start quality cross see what's very interesting to me is that the last one was Lake Placid versus anaconda and I'm like crocodile vs snake look that's an actual thing that's happened you can look up the real version of that it's quite a OD it's quite a thing I don't know if Santa SC I don't know if Santa Conda has any trivia besides you know it's based on an anaconda and stuff as pokedex entry says when it contracts its body over 220 pounds of sand spray from its nose if it ever runs out of sand it becomes disheartened oh then it needs team yell to encourage it giganto max all right it now has more than a million tons of say jeez I don't think the Pokemon world has a good grasp of measurements I mean a million tons of sand you got the Sahara yes I gantt a max it's a combination of gigantic and maximum and Santa cata is a combination of sand and anaconda a place where the anacondas don't roam is the sand but oh well maybe there's an anaconda variant that whatever this week's Pokemon are you ready because I may have written this very poorly seven down ah no it's actually back more to our traditional style okay this week's delightful Pokemon made its debut in the Pokemon cartoon in Japan on May 8th 2003 and in the United States on February 28th 2004 while not the Pokemon featured in the title of the episode it is notable that it and it's close cousin evolve simultaneously the episode goes on the pre evolution for this week's Pokemon is shared with another Pokemon if you wish to have it evolve into this week's Pokemon it must meet a particular personality value in Hoenn personality values are tied to danger as well as gender ability shininess and size spindle spots and unknowns letter are also coordinated with personality value but neither of them is this week's Pokemon the determinant for this week's Pokemon is the result of a modulo operation where you take the upper half of the pokemons personality value modulo 10 if it is less than 4 you get one Pokemon if it is greater than 4 you get this week's Pokemon in a unique way this means that when breeding for this week's Pokemon you may use the final evolution for a completely different Pokemon to obtain our Pokemon for the week conversely you may obtain this week's Pokemon unexpectedly when breeding for a different one there is no action that you as the player can take to influence this the personality value is determined when you receive the egg from the Pokemon daycare there you go real easy and modulo is a real math term alright that's our show if you want to follow Greg it is a there at white wing on Twitter we'll at wash of the sink I am at dragging a lake you follow the
