what happens when (4:02 - 4:06)
you go into apple podcast and you hit (4:04 - 4:08)
the little like i want to upgrade i (4:06 - 4:09)
don't know what those people are called (4:08 - 4:12)
subscribers but that you subscribe to a (4:09 - 4:14)
podcast so they're not subscribers this (4:12 - 4:16)
is like the youtube twitch problem (4:14 - 4:18)
you subscribe on twitch (4:16 - 4:20)
for money but you subscribe on youtube (4:18 - 4:21)
for free but you become a member on (4:20 - 4:23)
youtube for money i don't know (4:21 - 4:25)
there's a little if you listen on apple (4:23 - 4:26)
podcast there's a button to upgrade to (4:25 - 4:28)
get bonus podcasts and ad-free uh so (4:26 - 4:30)
that's there (4:28 - 4:32)
i will say the one thing i say at the (4:30 - 4:33)
beginning of that episode that i will (4:32 - 4:36)
say here just for clarification i did (4:33 - 4:38)
talk to niantic oh i guess we'll play (4:36 - 4:39)
the new news music i guess we'll start (4:38 - 4:41)
off with pogo because there's a little (4:39 - 4:43)
bit of pogo news uh we have uh (4:41 - 4:45)
stuff about masuda we have stuff about (4:43 - 4:47)
james turner we have stuff about dell (4:45 - 4:49)
fox the three icons of the pokemon (4:47 - 4:52)
company heck yeah uh (4:49 - 4:54)
i said this on the bonus podcast i will (4:52 - 4:56)
say it here i talked to niantic on (4:54 - 4:58)
sunday morning the day of the second day (4:56 - 5:00)
of go fest (4:58 - 5:01)
and they said (5:00 - 5:04)
the shiny odds this year are exactly the (5:01 - 5:06)
same as the shiny ads last year i then (5:04 - 5:09)
talked to them on monday morning (5:06 - 5:11)
and they said after the entire weekend (5:09 - 5:13)
is done we can confirm the amount of (5:11 - 5:15)
pokemon caught this year (5:13 - 5:17)
to the shiny pokemon caught ratio was (5:15 - 5:20)
exactly the same percentage as it was (5:17 - 5:21)
the year before i know what that (5:20 - 5:22)
percentage is i don't know if it's like (5:21 - 5:23)
a (5:22 - 5:26)
two percent or five percent or but i (5:23 - 5:28)
don't know but they said it was the same (5:26 - 5:30)
so (5:28 - 5:32)
um bobby and i do talk about why it (5:30 - 5:33)
might feel (5:32 - 5:34)
like (5:33 - 5:37)
you got less shinies because (5:34 - 5:39)
there were less there were technically (5:37 - 5:41)
more pokemon in this go fest and more of (5:39 - 5:45)
those pokemon could not be shiny um (5:41 - 5:46)
there was also the incense issue if (5:45 - 5:48)
there was any issue happening in go fest (5:46 - 5:51)
it was the actual the incense was (5:48 - 5:53)
technically broken and niantic did tweet (5:51 - 5:56)
about that and they didn't (5:53 - 5:57)
i don't know if there's going to be a (5:56 - 5:59)
makeup day for that (5:57 - 6:02)
i will also say that rng is a really (5:59 - 6:05)
silly and dumb thing (6:02 - 6:07)
one of the examples i used is i played i (6:05 - 6:08)
played every community (6:07 - 6:10)
uh and i feel like i play communion days (6:08 - 6:12)
pretty hard that's why gregan will leave (6:10 - 6:14)
me early because i continue to play and (6:12 - 6:16)
they they are like i'm done (6:14 - 6:18)
uh but on charmander community i played (6:16 - 6:21)
very aggressively in that three hours (6:18 - 6:23)
very first charmander community (6:21 - 6:25)
in that very first hour i got in those (6:23 - 6:26)
three hours (6:25 - 6:28)
i only got three shiny charmander it was (6:26 - 6:31)
my worst community ever i played the (6:28 - 6:33)
entire time i i was hustling i was at a (6:31 - 6:36)
plot spot that had plenty of stops they (6:33 - 6:39)
were luring up i had the incense on i (6:36 - 6:40)
i feel like i'm pretty good at playing (6:39 - 6:42)
pokemon go (6:40 - 6:45)
and debatable (6:42 - 6:46)
that charmander community i only got (6:45 - 6:49)
three and my watched my wife (6:46 - 6:51)
walk over to the (6:49 - 6:54)
the public bathroom area and she clicked (6:51 - 6:56)
on charmander it was shiny she caught it (6:54 - 6:57)
the next charmander she clicked on it (6:56 - 6:59)
was shiny she caught it the next (6:57 - 7:01)
charmander after that she clicked on it (6:59 - 7:04)
was shiny she caught she got three in (7:01 - 7:07)
the matter of of 20 seconds and she i (7:04 - 7:09)
think she ended that community with nine (7:07 - 7:10)
and (7:09 - 7:13)
that's what rng is right like no control (7:10 - 7:15)
over that you can't be goo you can't (7:13 - 7:19)
like get better at rng (7:15 - 7:20)
well (7:19 - 7:21)
you can't go to the gym and work out (7:20 - 7:24)
your rng muscles oh that is at least (7:21 - 7:26)
maybe one day you can (7:24 - 7:28)
i mean there's some supplements you can (7:26 - 7:29)
take yeah (7:28 - 7:32)
absolutely (7:29 - 7:33)
um (7:32 - 7:35)
niantic did put out a thing saying uh (7:33 - 7:37)
this off pokemon go live we are grateful (7:35 - 7:40)
for a successful pokemon go fest (7:37 - 7:43)
uh there was 750 million poke stops spun (7:40 - 7:46)
a billion pokemon caught (7:43 - 7:49)
uh people trainers walked 10 hundred or (7:46 - 7:52)
sorry of 100. uh a hundred million (7:49 - 7:55)
kilometers that's a word (7:52 - 7:55)
uh people were able to access and catch (7:55 - 7:59)

you can go to niantic's website to see (11:14 - 11:18)
if your city has in-person activations i (11:16 - 11:19)
still don't know if this is worth it to (11:18 - 11:21)
go because uh the one i went to rained (11:19 - 11:24)
out um (11:21 - 11:24)
columbus ohio is hosting the (11:25 - 11:30)
north america (11:28 - 11:34)

in columbus ohio i i had a plane ticket (11:43 - 11:47)
booked (11:46 - 11:50)
and i have recently canceled that trip (11:47 - 11:52)
uh because (11:50 - 11:55)
not only did was my ticket 700 to fly to (11:52 - 11:59)
ohio which is way too much money to go (11:55 - 11:59)
to (11:59 - 12:02)
ohio (11:59 - 12:03)
uh (12:02 - 12:06)
the hotels around the convention center (12:03 - 12:09)
where the n uh the naic are being hosted (12:06 - 12:11)
are not only all sold out but the (12:09 - 12:13)
remaining hotels (12:11 - 12:16)
are anywhere between 900 to 1200 a night (12:13 - 12:20)
heck no oh no nothing in columbus worth (12:16 - 12:22)
that much exactly (12:20 - 12:24)
and i was going to split it with a (12:22 - 12:26)
friend and she (12:24 - 12:28)
uh (12:26 - 12:29)
i don't know where she was traveling (12:28 - 12:31)
from um because i've never actually met (12:29 - 12:34)
her in person but i was like when she (12:31 - 12:36)
said like oh hotels were 600 i was like (12:34 - 12:38)
oh that's not too bad like i would love (12:36 - 12:41)
to split a 600 hotel (12:38 - 12:43)
because then it's only like 300. and (12:41 - 12:45)
then she was like oh i didn't book and i (12:43 - 12:47)
was like oh great i mean i can book no (12:45 - 12:49)
big deal and when i was looking it was (12:47 - 12:52)
900 to 1200 and i got back to her and i (12:49 - 12:52)
was like (12:52 - 12:56)
i think i have to cancel like i can't (12:52 - 12:59)
i can't with good consciousness (12:56 - 13:01)
book (12:59 - 13:01)
this much money for columbus ohio (13:02 - 13:07)
with good what like like in in good (13:07 - 13:12)
conscience that's what he meant that (13:10 - 13:13)
that's what i heard (13:12 - 13:15)
yeah she knows what i'm trying to say i (13:13 - 13:17)
know what you're saying too but nobody (13:15 - 13:20)
else does (13:17 - 13:20)
but i i (13:21 - 13:25)
booked um (13:23 - 13:27)
i registered for the pokemon go so i (13:25 - 13:28)
could play competitive pokemon go (13:27 - 13:30)
because that's what i wanted to do (13:28 - 13:32)
literally all year i was like oh i'm (13:30 - 13:34)
going to go to first i was i was going (13:32 - 13:35)
to go to (13:34 - 13:38)
orlando florida to play pokemon go (13:35 - 13:40)
and florida the whole florida event got (13:38 - 13:42)
cancelled by pokemon (13:40 - 13:45)
and then i was going to go to indiana (13:42 - 13:48)
to play pokemon go but the same thing (13:45 - 13:50)
happened in indiana that's happening (13:48 - 13:53)
with ohio like i don't want to spend (13:50 - 13:54)
seven hundred dollars to fly to (13:53 - 13:56)
indianapolis (13:54 - 13:58)
there's nothing there (13:56 - 14:00)
it's a bad state i'm sorry to learn that (13:58 - 14:03)
you know if you live in any indiana you (14:00 - 14:05)
know your state is bad that's it's okay (14:03 - 14:08)
all of indiana is bad there are outside (14:05 - 14:10)
of fort wayne actually most of the state (14:08 - 14:11)
is nice (14:10 - 14:13)
and then the (14:11 - 14:15)
i think the other place to play pokemon (14:13 - 14:16)
go is milwaukee but i registered for (14:15 - 14:20)
sword and shield so i mean i had (14:16 - 14:21)
60 down the drain i guess not to go to (14:20 - 14:25)
ohio but i again i can't (14:21 - 14:27)
there was another thing that like (14:25 - 14:29)
bothered me which was (14:27 - 14:31)
i'm going to germany the week after so (14:29 - 14:34)
ideally i get back from ohio on monday (14:31 - 14:36)
and then i get on a plane to go to (14:34 - 14:38)
germany on wednesday (14:36 - 14:43)
and i i just i can't risk getting sick (14:38 - 14:45)
in ohio and then canceling the german (14:43 - 14:47)
the germany trip is way more important (14:45 - 14:51)
and oddly enough significantly cheaper (14:47 - 14:52)
well people want to go to germany (14:51 - 14:55)
[Laughter] (14:52 - 14:56)
but you didn't raise (14:55 - 15:00)
the big true issue of the columbus ohio (14:56 - 15:03)
north american pokemon invitational or (15:00 - 15:05)
whatever international (15:03 - 15:07)
unless that's later in the news (15:05 - 15:09)
oh uh the reason i brought up ohio is (15:07 - 15:11)
because of all these in-person (15:09 - 15:12)
activations (15:11 - 15:14)
columbus ohio is not one (15:12 - 15:19)
but at and and why is that also an issue (15:14 - 15:20)
because dino communities that we put the (15:19 - 15:24)
pieces together they scheduled dino (15:20 - 15:27)
community day in the middle of the north (15:24 - 15:29)
american international pokemon (15:27 - 15:30)
championship (15:29 - 15:34)
same day thanks janine (15:30 - 15:36)
because nobody's out of control nobody (15:34 - 15:38)
knows your phone number janine but (15:36 - 15:41)
people know my phone number and call me (15:38 - 15:43)
to complain (15:41 - 15:45)
about the fact that dino community day (15:43 - 15:47)
was scheduled on the same day as the (15:45 - 15:49)
championships (15:47 - 15:51)
it's not even the same (15:49 - 15:53)
it's the same weekend which is like (15:51 - 15:56)
we've seen this time like like the the (15:53 - 15:59)
if if some of y'all don't remember a (15:56 - 16:00)
game called pokemon sword and shield (15:59 - 16:02)
came out on a friday (16:00 - 16:05)
and that weekend that same exact weekend (16:02 - 16:07)
on that friday the (16:05 - 16:10)
the uk (16:07 - 16:12)
championships were taking place i don't (16:10 - 16:14)
remember i don't know if it was called (16:12 - 16:15)
the european international champion i (16:14 - 16:17)
don't know if it's called the british (16:15 - 16:18)
international champion i don't know i (16:17 - 16:19)
don't i can't remember what was called (16:18 - 16:20)
but it was (16:19 - 16:23)
a the same tournament that's happening (16:20 - 16:26)
in america is was happening in europe (16:23 - 16:28)
the same exact weekend that sword and (16:26 - 16:29)
shield launched and they were still (16:28 - 16:30)
playing (16:29 - 16:32)
uh ultrasound ultra moon because that (16:30 - 16:34)
was the (16:32 - 16:36)
that was the main competitive game even (16:34 - 16:37)
though let's go pikachu let's go eevee (16:36 - 16:38)
was out (16:37 - 16:42)
and then also that saturday the day (16:38 - 16:43)
after sword and shield came out it was (16:42 - 16:45)
chimchar community day (16:43 - 16:48)
i get that they want (16:45 - 16:51)
all pokemon fans to experience a pokemon (16:48 - 16:53)
weekend (16:51 - 16:56)
but like come on like you don't think (16:53 - 16:59)
there's not like you don't think some of (16:56 - 17:00)
your competitive players want to (16:59 - 17:03)
participate in community day you don't (17:00 - 17:04)
think (17:03 - 17:06)
that (17:04 - 17:07)
half your player base buying sword and (17:06 - 17:09)
shield want to just enjoy sword and (17:07 - 17:11)
shield for that weekend at least put it (17:09 - 17:14)
on sunday (17:11 - 17:17)
and even even if it was like okay (17:14 - 17:18)
sword and shield trainers you can take (17:17 - 17:20)
three hours to go catch some chimp chars (17:18 - 17:23)
yeah sure we can but like if you (17:20 - 17:25)
performed (17:23 - 17:27)
halfway decent on friday you are stuck (17:25 - 17:29)
performing on saturday (17:27 - 17:32)
like there are realistically there are (17:29 - 17:34)
only (17:32 - 17:34)
16 people in the vgc that are going to (17:34 - 17:39)
play on sunday because it's gonna be (17:38 - 17:41)
like top 16 or top eight (17:39 - 17:43)
right like (17:41 - 17:46)
at least put community on sunday then (17:43 - 17:49)
it's not unheard of (17:46 - 17:52)
well apparently it is um and it's the (17:49 - 17:54)
same thing here it's like you don't have (17:52 - 17:56)
you don't have an in-person meetup in (17:54 - 17:58)
columbus ohio which is mind-boggling to (17:56 - 18:00)
me that you wouldn't want like out of (17:58 - 18:01)
like (18:00 - 18:03)
i'm looking at this whole map and (18:01 - 18:04)
there's a lot of cities picked and (18:03 - 18:06)
that's great that you know and for the (18:04 - 18:08)
record niantic does hire like (18:06 - 18:11)
third-party people to represent niantic (18:08 - 18:12)
at these events (18:11 - 18:14)
um (18:12 - 18:16)
but why would you not want a niantic (18:14 - 18:18)
tent and like make a big deal (18:16 - 18:20)
in the city (18:18 - 18:22)
that is hosting this huge pokemon (18:20 - 18:23)
tournament (18:22 - 18:25)
also again (18:23 - 18:27)
dino is on saturday (18:25 - 18:30)
the there's there's so many competitive (18:27 - 18:32)
players that are kind of forced to play (18:30 - 18:33)
on saturday that probably want to (18:32 - 18:34)
participate (18:33 - 18:36)
ag and when there's only going to be (18:34 - 18:40)
like a top 8 or a top 16 that's a that's (18:36 - 18:44)
not 200 400 500 700 people (18:40 - 18:47)
why is it not on sunday anyways it the (18:44 - 18:50)
dino community saturday june 25th from (18:47 - 18:52)
11 to 2. (18:50 - 18:54)
um (18:52 - 18:54)
dinah will appear more frequently in the (18:55 - 19:00)
wild the surprise did you know we we (18:57 - 19:03)
said this was going to happen (19:00 - 19:06)
you know i'm going to guard a limb here (19:03 - 19:09)
niantic put axe you in raids (19:06 - 19:11)
axio follows the same thing as high (19:09 - 19:14)
dragon dratini (19:11 - 19:16)
uh you know mureep they're all dragon (19:14 - 19:18)
pokemon the maripo is a joke but (19:16 - 19:20)
actually not really a joke it does (19:18 - 19:21)
eventually turn into a dragon it does (19:20 - 19:22)
become a dragon (19:21 - 19:24)
tyranitar you know these pseudo (19:22 - 19:26)
legendaries (19:24 - 19:27)
um (19:26 - 19:29)
do you think they like being called (19:27 - 19:30)
pseudo (19:29 - 19:32)
i know they're legendary in mind they're (19:30 - 19:35)
legendary across the arcanine is listed (19:32 - 19:37)
as legendary the legendary pokemon (19:35 - 19:40)
it not pseudo nowhere the only thing (19:37 - 19:42)
fake hair is suitable (19:40 - 19:44)
i do like pseudo wood though (19:42 - 19:46)
uh there's no doubt in my mind that xu (19:44 - 19:48)
doesn't get it's okay day right we've (19:46 - 19:50)
been we've said this to the lead-up of (19:48 - 19:52)
go fest like don't spend money on taxi (19:50 - 19:54)
raids and then be like (19:52 - 19:55)
they're coming (19:54 - 19:58)
eventually right it'd like you (19:55 - 20:00)
struggling to get a tortuga out of eggs (19:58 - 20:01)
in pokemon go don't worry they'll make (20:00 - 20:05)
it easier in the future they always do (20:01 - 20:07)
but if you want to participate in dino (20:05 - 20:09)
community let me tell you what there is (20:07 - 20:10)
to offer one (20:09 - 20:12)
fourth the hatch egg distance when (20:10 - 20:14)
incubators are placed into eggs two (20:12 - 20:17)
times to catch candy two times the catch (20:14 - 20:18)
candy (20:17 - 20:21)
excel from catching dyno lure modules (20:18 - 20:23)
will last three hours incense will last (20:21 - 20:25)
three hours take a few snapshots for a (20:23 - 20:28)
surprise one additional special trade (20:25 - 20:30)
and trades made will be f (20:28 - 20:31)
uh trades made during the event up to (20:30 - 20:35)
five hours afterwards will be 50 percent (20:31 - 20:37)
less stardust (20:35 - 20:39)
also because it is the season of go (20:37 - 20:42)
which is still a bad name in my opinion (20:39 - 20:43)
for this (20:42 - 20:44)
it's just a bad name because your game's (20:43 - 20:46)
called pokemon go and when i say season (20:44 - 20:47)
of go it just sounds like i'm saying (20:46 - 20:49)
it's a season and i don't know what the (20:47 - 20:53)
name is but the name is season of go (20:49 - 20:55)
you do get two special trades a day (20:53 - 20:58)
meaning on go fest you will are starting (20:55 - 21:00)
echo fest community you will have three (20:58 - 21:03)
special trades total and all of them (21:00 - 21:06)
will be 50 percent less stardust (21:03 - 21:08)
i do want to say ever since the just not (21:06 - 21:10)
trying to defend niantic but i do want (21:08 - 21:12)
to like lay out here that these are like (21:10 - 21:15)
double the bonuses of previous community (21:12 - 21:17)
days they started this one they removed (21:15 - 21:19)
the six hours went to three hours with (21:17 - 21:20)
stufful and we're like we're going to (21:19 - 21:22)
give you more bonuses for the shorter (21:20 - 21:25)
amount of time so you don't have to play (21:22 - 21:27)
as long which i will still say that (21:25 - 21:29)
worked for scuffle like i got way more (21:27 - 21:31)
stardust way more candy (21:29 - 21:33)
way more whatever in the three hours (21:31 - 21:36)
than i did playing all six hours that's (21:33 - 21:37)
not the complaint people see people want (21:36 - 21:39)
the flexibility (21:37 - 21:41)
but i mean (21:39 - 21:44)
more of the stuff i never use again is (21:41 - 21:46)
not a value add if you don't use it it (21:44 - 21:48)
doesn't add value (21:46 - 21:49)
i use it all (21:48 - 21:52)
yeah but you're also not right in the (21:49 - 21:52)
head (21:52 - 21:55)
that's true i also would play the entire (21:52 - 21:56)
six hours because i was (21:55 - 21:59)
out of my mind (21:56 - 22:02)
like saying the most obsessed person is (21:59 - 22:05)
the prime example is not a good example (22:02 - 22:09)
i know the flaws in my logic (22:05 - 22:10)
i'm just making sure everybody else (22:09 - 22:14)
knows the flaws in your logic if (22:10 - 22:15)
let's (22:14 - 22:17)
if if the time thing wasn't an issue (22:15 - 22:20)
i think cutting community to three hours (22:17 - 22:22)
and giving you the same amount of (22:20 - 22:25)
rewards is very respectful of your time (22:22 - 22:27)
like why would i want to do why would i (22:25 - 22:29)
like i have plenty of things to do in (22:27 - 22:31)
the day so giving me three hours back (22:29 - 22:33)
but at the end of that three hours i'm (22:31 - 22:34)
getting the same rewards as six hours i (22:33 - 22:36)
think is fantastic (22:34 - 22:40)
but again the problem is when can i play (22:36 - 22:42)
so (22:40 - 22:45)
niantic has a solution (22:42 - 22:47)
for that possibly (22:45 - 22:49)
uh so let's talk about that (22:47 - 22:53)
uh so there's bonuses for groups (22:49 - 22:55)
work together with other trainers to (22:53 - 22:57)
unlock additional bonuses (22:55 - 22:59)
so um they've done this before they've (22:57 - 23:01)
done this twice before one for geodude (22:59 - 23:02)
one could be a day one for scuffle (23:01 - 23:03)
community i believe stuff will could be (23:02 - 23:05)
a day if you caught a bunch of pokemon (23:03 - 23:08)
stuff around a lure module it will (23:05 - 23:10)
activate like double stardust i think it (23:08 - 23:12)
was or four times stardust and then for (23:10 - 23:14)
geodude i think it was if you caught a (23:12 - 23:16)
bunch of geodudes along laura module i (23:14 - 23:18)
never had that happen because uh i (23:16 - 23:19)
played in the rain and that didn't (23:18 - 23:22)
actually happen um it was like four (23:19 - 23:23)
times the catch (23:22 - 23:25)
bonus i think (23:23 - 23:27)
this time around they're saying if you (23:25 - 23:28)
if enough pokemon are caught around a (23:27 - 23:32)
single lure module wild zolas will (23:28 - 23:33)
appear (23:32 - 23:34)
near the stop (23:33 - 23:35)
but they're not saying this wireless (23:34 - 23:37)
could be shiny just (23:35 - 23:39)
it's one has the shiny symbol buy it it (23:37 - 23:41)
does not have the shiny symbol the (23:39 - 23:43)
symbol i think the reason why you would (23:41 - 23:44)
just get more candy from it you would (23:43 - 23:45)
just pan up it get more candy because (23:44 - 23:49)
it's the evolution maybe more xl candy (23:45 - 23:51)
it's what it's like an okay bonus i (23:49 - 23:53)
think (23:51 - 23:54)
maybe they should have started off with (23:53 - 23:55)
this (23:54 - 23:57)
for i don't know i guess like you could (23:55 - 23:58)
at least visually see it happening (23:57 - 24:00)
whereas when we did stufful greg and i (23:58 - 24:01)
were like (24:00 - 24:03)
did it happen this is how we're getting (24:01 - 24:06)
to stardust i don't know like (24:03 - 24:08)
um (24:06 - 24:09)
okay here's the (24:08 - 24:11)
here's the (24:09 - 24:13)
the the new thing here (24:11 - 24:15)
brand new first time ever we're excited (24:13 - 24:16)
to announce that trainers can look (24:15 - 24:18)
forward to more fun during communities (24:16 - 24:20)
after the three-hour community ends uh (24:18 - 24:22)
trainers will be able to challenge (24:20 - 24:24)
unique four-star battles claiming (24:22 - 24:27)
one in victory well okay i think they (24:24 - 24:29)
changed this a little bit from when i (24:27 - 24:31)
i'm gonna just start over here (24:29 - 24:33)
we're excited to announce that trainers (24:31 - 24:35)
can look forward to more fun during (24:33 - 24:37)
community after the three-hour community (24:35 - 24:39)
event ends trainers will be able to (24:37 - 24:41)
challenge unique four-star raid battles (24:39 - 24:43)
claiming one in victory will cause more (24:41 - 24:46)
dyno to appear around that gym for 30 (24:43 - 24:48)
minutes please note that community (24:46 - 24:50)
bonuses listed above in the event (24:48 - 24:52)
bonuses and bonuses for group section (24:50 - 24:53)
only apply to the three-hour community (24:52 - 24:56)
today (24:53 - 24:58)
four-star raid battles so they took away (24:56 - 25:00)
two and four-star raid battles when they (24:58 - 25:02)
revamped the raid system which in my (25:00 - 25:03)
opinion (25:02 - 25:06)
was a good change (25:03 - 25:07)
because no one wanted there was nothing (25:06 - 25:09)
no one wanted to do four star needle (25:07 - 25:11)
queen raids for a non-shiny noodle queen (25:09 - 25:12)
that (25:11 - 25:15)
didn't give you any bonuses um (25:12 - 25:17)
zwiles will appearing be appearing in (25:15 - 25:20)
four star raids band together (25:17 - 25:23)
to emerge victorious these raid uh these (25:20 - 25:25)
rates can only be accessed with raid (25:23 - 25:27)
passes and premium raid passes remote (25:25 - 25:30)
raid passes cannot be used (25:27 - 25:32)
when you complete the four star raid (25:30 - 25:35)
battles when you defeat the wireless in (25:32 - 25:37)
four-star raid battles dino will appear (25:35 - 25:39)
in a 300 meter radius around the gym (25:37 - 25:41)
that hosted that raid for 30 minutes if (25:39 - 25:43)
you're lucky you may encounter a shiny (25:41 - 25:44)
one (25:43 - 25:46)
the cliff note says here dino will (25:44 - 25:48)
appear under these circumstances will (25:46 - 25:50)
have the same chance of appearing as a (25:48 - 25:52)
shiny pokemon that appears during the (25:50 - 25:54)
three hour event period (25:52 - 25:56)
there will also be the one dollar field (25:54 - 25:58)
research for dino if you want to spend (25:56 - 25:59)
the dollar (25:58 - 26:01)
um there will also be dino stickers (25:59 - 26:03)
there also the dino hat that you were (26:01 - 26:06)
able to earn a year ago you can just buy (26:03 - 26:10)
it now for 150 pokemon coins (26:06 - 26:12)
and that's it that is the that is the (26:10 - 26:14)
community day that is the event (26:12 - 26:16)
uh i think (26:14 - 26:19)
there was a lot of confusion around the (26:16 - 26:21)
um (26:19 - 26:21)
uh the dino details here (26:22 - 26:28)
the dino details (26:25 - 26:29)
the dd the dino details (26:28 - 26:31)
the flintstones here (26:29 - 26:34)
uh i'm gonna grab a youtube comment (26:31 - 26:35)
right now (26:34 - 26:37)
from last week's episode this is from (26:35 - 26:40)
tom they say hey guys loving the podcast (26:37 - 26:43)
as always uh as i'm sure you'll mention (26:40 - 26:45)
uh the next upcoming week uh the dyno (26:43 - 26:47)
community day is banning remote raids (26:45 - 26:49)
for his wireless could you help us (26:47 - 26:50)
understand how scaling back everything (26:49 - 26:52)
and go incense three hour communities (26:50 - 26:54)
removing remote wades actually helps (26:52 - 26:56)
niantic i'm so confused i already missed (26:54 - 26:58)
geodude community due to last minute (26:56 - 26:59)
personal reasons i was out in the (26:58 - 27:01)
afternoon i could have benefited from (26:59 - 27:02)
the usual six hours now remote raids (27:01 - 27:04)
look to be on the way out does niantic (27:02 - 27:07)
actually want people to play less (27:04 - 27:09)
um (27:07 - 27:11)
so (27:09 - 27:12)
no (27:11 - 27:14)
remote raids are not on the way out (27:12 - 27:15)
uh (27:14 - 27:16)
i think (27:15 - 27:19)
at least when i talk to niantic (27:16 - 27:20)
and i'm always very cautious of what i (27:19 - 27:23)
can say or what i'm allowed to say um (27:20 - 27:24)
they (27:23 - 27:27)
they admitted to the creator group that (27:24 - 27:30)
remote raids were hurting the in-person (27:27 - 27:31)
experience (27:30 - 27:35)
and i think that is pretty obvious to (27:31 - 27:37)
people (27:35 - 27:39)
who say there's no one to do raids with (27:37 - 27:41)
anymore right like (27:39 - 27:43)
i don't have that problem i can go to (27:41 - 27:46)
mall of america i can go to (27:43 - 27:48)
a park in minneapolis and there are (27:46 - 27:51)
there are people to raid with right i i (27:48 - 27:53)
know i'm not the problem but when but it (27:51 - 27:55)
really not an eye-opening thing but i (27:53 - 27:57)
think i've known that was happening for (27:55 - 27:59)
for quite a while is like (27:57 - 28:01)
you know i stream on twitch say and i (27:59 - 28:03)
stream pokemon go and when i was (28:01 - 28:04)
streaming 16 hours of go fest people (28:03 - 28:06)
would come in and they would be like (28:04 - 28:08)
i wish i had people in my community to (28:06 - 28:10)
play with because they would see how (28:08 - 28:12)
many people were around the park or (28:10 - 28:13)
where we were at the zoo and there was a (28:12 - 28:14)
lot of people and we would jump into (28:13 - 28:16)
raids and like will greg and i didn't (28:14 - 28:18)
talk to anyone (28:16 - 28:19)
but when we would jump into a like we (28:18 - 28:21)
talked to that one dude asked us if we (28:19 - 28:23)
were going to do that like kyogre yeah (28:21 - 28:25)
but but like (28:23 - 28:27)
every right we jumped into did we invite (28:25 - 28:29)
people yes but there were also just (28:27 - 28:31)
people joining the raids that were in (28:29 - 28:32)
the area (28:31 - 28:34)
um (28:32 - 28:36)
and and there was tons of people that (28:34 - 28:38)
came through my stream that were like (28:36 - 28:41)
again i wish i there there's no one no (28:38 - 28:42)
one goes to park anymore everyone just (28:41 - 28:45)
remotes raids so there's (28:42 - 28:48)
the this is on niantic's shoulders now (28:45 - 28:52)
to be like we want remote raids did this (28:48 - 28:56)
and how do we keep remote raids (28:52 - 28:58)
but get people to go back out to the (28:56 - 28:59)
park (28:58 - 29:01)
so then people can be like i have a (28:59 - 29:03)
community once again (29:01 - 29:05)
um because (29:03 - 29:06)
i've had it (29:05 - 29:08)
where i've gone to a community in the (29:06 - 29:10)
middle of january (29:08 - 29:13)
to a park i'd normally gone to (29:10 - 29:15)
and when it's really cold out and when (29:13 - 29:17)
there's a pandemic and when your pokemon (29:15 - 29:18)
isn't that exciting (29:17 - 29:20)
and you get to the park and there's no (29:18 - 29:22)
one there (29:20 - 29:26)
you go well i guess i'll do one lap and (29:22 - 29:27)
go home because (29:26 - 29:30)
no one's here like like and we i think (29:27 - 29:32)
we talked about this a month ago like (29:30 - 29:34)
whether or not you're actually talking (29:32 - 29:35)
or communicating with people you're (29:34 - 29:38)
still benefiting (29:35 - 29:40)
from other people existing in that area (29:38 - 29:42)
whether that's lures or being able to (29:40 - 29:45)
jump into raids um (29:42 - 29:46)
so (29:45 - 29:49)
do does niantic want to actually have (29:46 - 29:51)
people play less no (29:49 - 29:53)
and i think the (29:51 - 29:54)
so this wireless thing is weird because (29:53 - 29:56)
i i think people like to complain just (29:54 - 29:58)
for the sake of complaining (29:56 - 30:01)
uh you don't want to remote raid into (29:58 - 30:04)
zwielus you don't want to pay a dollar (30:01 - 30:06)
to remote raid because you get really (30:04 - 30:08)
nothing from it it's not a challenging (30:06 - 30:10)
raid you could spend that dollar on a (30:08 - 30:12)
five star and get way better rewards get (30:10 - 30:16)
like it can't be shiny (30:12 - 30:16)
i don't know why you would want to (30:16 - 30:21)
remote right into it the whole point (30:18 - 30:23)
of this these wirelesses (30:21 - 30:26)
is for me will and greg to be like (30:23 - 30:27)
there's a zyliss (30:26 - 30:28)
it's (30:27 - 30:31)
it's three o'clock we'll do it now we (30:28 - 30:34)
have now now when we're sitting at (30:31 - 30:36)
b-dubs doing this wireless raid while (30:34 - 30:38)
we're enjoying our dinner at b-dubs now (30:36 - 30:39)
a bunch of dinos are going to spawn (30:38 - 30:41)
around us because we did this (30:39 - 30:44)
yeah if i invite (30:41 - 30:46)
nick from boston to join us in this (30:44 - 30:48)
wireless raid can he help us do it yeah (30:46 - 30:51)
but we don't need his help like we we (30:48 - 30:52)
can use violet i could probably solos (30:51 - 30:54)
wireless (30:52 - 30:56)
so like yeah he's spending a dollar to (30:54 - 30:58)
catch us wireless but like (30:56 - 30:59)
you're getting double catch candy that (30:58 - 31:02)
day you literally have to catch (30:59 - 31:03)
three dino (31:02 - 31:06)
with pin up berries to evolve it to get (31:03 - 31:08)
zweilas like (31:06 - 31:09)
you (31:08 - 31:10)
if anything they're saving you money (31:09 - 31:13)
don't do this like don't invite remote (31:10 - 31:15)
right people do this wireless there's no (31:13 - 31:18)
benefit to that (31:15 - 31:18)
if people would rather pay money than do (31:20 - 31:25)
your thing your thing isn't fun (31:22 - 31:27)
true (31:25 - 31:27)
but this is a situation where it's kind (31:28 - 31:32)
of sus if you'd rather pay money (31:30 - 31:34)
especially when you just came off three (31:32 - 31:36)
hours where you could have gotten enough (31:34 - 31:39)
dinos to evolve a dino into his wireless (31:36 - 31:40)
there i mean there are good enough (31:39 - 31:42)
reasons (31:40 - 31:45)
like they did this one (31:42 - 31:48)
smart is it a sign of where they want to (31:45 - 31:50)
go i don't know (31:48 - 31:52)
what do you mean by smart sorry (31:50 - 31:55)
like it's a four-star raid so (31:52 - 31:57)
it's unusual (31:55 - 31:59)
it's doesn't stop anything from (31:57 - 32:02)
happening in community day it is a bonus (31:59 - 32:04)
thing that can happen (32:02 - 32:06)
in an effort to see if that's enough to (32:04 - 32:09)
get people out i don't think it is (32:06 - 32:11)
but at least they aren't taking away (32:09 - 32:13)
from five stars which are predicted (32:11 - 32:15)
three stars which are (32:13 - 32:18)
generally bad anyways like yeah there's (32:15 - 32:19)
not a lot of three stars that are worth (32:18 - 32:22)
it is a unique slot that they're sliding (32:19 - 32:23)
something into (32:22 - 32:27)
so that the impact is less (32:23 - 32:27)
i i am not (32:27 - 32:30)
confident enough in how corporations (32:30 - 32:35)
work to say that this isn't the first (32:33 - 32:37)
salvo and getting rid of remote raid (32:35 - 32:39)
passes they're not getting rid of remote (32:37 - 32:40)
raids (32:39 - 32:44)
i li i've talked to niantic several (32:40 - 32:46)
several times in the last like month (32:44 - 32:47)
about remote raids they have zero desire (32:46 - 32:50)
to get rid of remote rates uh 15 years (32:47 - 32:52)
ago nobody was getting rid of unlimited (32:50 - 32:55)
plans and then they did like (32:52 - 32:55)
like (32:55 - 32:59)
that's what they say now (32:55 - 33:00)
who knows what the future happens and (32:59 - 33:02)
who knows how this will change that (33:00 - 33:04)
decision like i am not comfortable in (33:02 - 33:07)
saying that because they're saying that (33:04 - 33:09)
now but they're also doing this that (33:07 - 33:11)
that those two aren't tied together (33:09 - 33:13)
because i know how corporations work and (33:11 - 33:16)
i know the decisions that they make and (33:13 - 33:19)
this could be a test to see if (33:16 - 33:21)
they can eventually phase out remote (33:19 - 33:25)
raid passes completely we don't know (33:21 - 33:26)
i don't know because i've talked to (33:25 - 33:28)
niantic specifically yes and i've talked (33:26 - 33:30)
to a million companies that say we'll (33:28 - 33:32)
never do that and then two years later (33:30 - 33:34)
they do exactly that because they'll say (33:32 - 33:36)
things to get you off their back and (33:34 - 33:38)
then two years later they changed their (33:36 - 33:40)
mind i'm saying this every corporation (33:38 - 33:43)
has a complete history of doing that but (33:40 - 33:45)
this is a bad example to be like they're (33:43 - 33:46)
this is a test to see if they would (33:45 - 33:48)
phase out (33:46 - 33:50)
because like there is no point to remote (33:48 - 33:52)
race nobody said that they just said it (33:50 - 33:55)
he just said it could be but and i can (33:52 - 33:56)
also give the (33:55 - 33:57)
the (33:56 - 33:58)
contrasting (33:57 - 34:02)
argument that you know uh we've said (33:58 - 34:04)
hey don't um (34:02 - 34:06)
don't like turn things off just make the (34:04 - 34:08)
incentive to do something (34:06 - 34:10)
better right the the thing you want (34:08 - 34:12)
people to do right and this is an (34:10 - 34:14)
example of this yeah we want people to (34:12 - 34:16)
rate in person okay if you do this (34:14 - 34:18)
wireless rate in person you get a (34:16 - 34:19)
benefit (34:18 - 34:22)
yes yeah i mean that's what i'm saying i (34:19 - 34:23)
think this is a good way to say it but i (34:22 - 34:26)
am not com i am not convinced knowing (34:23 - 34:28)
how every company works that we can (34:26 - 34:31)
sufficiently say that this isn't a step (34:28 - 34:34)
of tests to get rid of paid races if i (34:31 - 34:36)
want to guess what's going to happen to (34:34 - 34:37)
the future of remote raids it's going to (34:36 - 34:40)
go from a dollar a pass to two dollars a (34:37 - 34:42)
pass it is it it is going to turn into a (34:40 - 34:44)
team rocket radar and (34:42 - 34:46)
i like you can skip (34:44 - 34:48)
battling six team rocket grunts and you (34:46 - 34:50)
can spend two dollars (34:48 - 34:52)
and get that radar (34:50 - 34:54)
and to be honest (34:52 - 34:56)
it's i kind of think it's worth it at (34:54 - 34:59)
this point because six grunts is is (34:56 - 35:02)
not only a time sink but not fun (34:59 - 35:04)
at all (35:02 - 35:04)
uh (35:04 - 35:08)
like if if they if they were to ever (35:06 - 35:10)
pull the trigger of removing remote raid (35:08 - 35:12)
passes they have not done the thing that (35:10 - 35:13)
they said they're going to do which is (35:12 - 35:15)
increase the price to what they (35:13 - 35:17)
envisioned the (35:15 - 35:19)
i don't know what the original price is (35:17 - 35:20)
supposed to be because they keep saying (35:19 - 35:21)
that it's been discounted it's been (35:20 - 35:23)
discounted it's been discounted (35:21 - 35:25)
i don't know what the original price of (35:23 - 35:26)
remote rate passes are (35:25 - 35:28)
but (35:26 - 35:30)
they have said that remote raid passes (35:28 - 35:32)
is hurting the in-person experience (35:30 - 35:34)
and they don't want to remove that so (35:32 - 35:36)
they need to they need to do something (35:34 - 35:38)
to then balance it out (35:36 - 35:40)
and i think i do think this is a good (35:38 - 35:42)
balance (35:40 - 35:44)
i do think that like (35:42 - 35:45)
you know if greg and i are doing (35:44 - 35:48)
community day and will is running late (35:45 - 35:50)
because he's clanging and banging at the (35:48 - 35:53)
gym and he arrives to mall of america (35:50 - 35:55)
and he's only caught one shiny dino so (35:53 - 35:56)
far (35:55 - 35:58)
i think it's great for for the three of (35:56 - 36:00)
us to jump into a raid we can use our (35:58 - 36:01)
free raid passes because you get the (36:00 - 36:03)
free raid passes we do the dyno now (36:01 - 36:06)
there's more dino spawning (36:03 - 36:07)
um (36:06 - 36:08)
yeah cause you guys are too greedy to (36:07 - 36:12)
trade each one shiny dino thanks a lot (36:08 - 36:13)
i would trade you (36:12 - 36:15)
i tried to trade there was there was a (36:13 - 36:18)
miscommunication in the in the original (36:15 - 36:19)
press release i think it said you needed (36:18 - 36:21)
10 people to do it (36:19 - 36:24)
um that was just like uh (36:21 - 36:26)
that was just like the basic in-game bad (36:24 - 36:28)
suggestion because when you do like a (36:26 - 36:30)
one-star raid i think it says like you (36:28 - 36:32)
need three to four people to do this (36:30 - 36:34)
one-star raid but like in reality you (36:32 - 36:35)
you don't and i think when you do a (36:34 - 36:36)
three-star rate i think it says you need (36:35 - 36:37)
like (36:36 - 36:40)
seven to eight people to do it but like (36:37 - 36:43)
most level 40 players can solo (36:40 - 36:45)
themselves you just said it right it's (36:43 - 36:48)
seven to eight normal people (36:45 - 36:52)
three freaks who are over 40. (36:48 - 36:52)
um (36:54 - 36:56)
so niantic did clarify that (36:54 - 36:59)
realistically if if you were one of (36:56 - 37:01)
those hardcore players you could (36:59 - 37:03)
probably solo this um if you were not a (37:01 - 37:05)
hardcore player it would probably be um (37:03 - 37:08)
about three people to use wireless um (37:05 - 37:11)
[Music] (37:08 - 37:12)
so (37:11 - 37:14)
yeah you'll be able to jump in do it i (37:12 - 37:16)
saw comments on twitter of like oh now (37:14 - 37:18)
niantic is making us pay for community (37:16 - 37:20)
day (37:18 - 37:20)
you (37:21 - 37:24)
the three-hour community is still there (37:22 - 37:26)
it's totally free it's the same thing it (37:24 - 37:28)
always is this is just like (37:26 - 37:30)
if you want an extra 30 minutes and you (37:28 - 37:32)
have your free remote raid pass and you (37:30 - 37:34)
and a friend are standing there just (37:32 - 37:37)
remote like not remote in but like vlog (37:34 - 37:40)
jump into the raid and do it and then (37:37 - 37:43)
now you have more dinos (37:40 - 37:44)
on the flip side if also you don't need (37:43 - 37:47)
any more dinos then don't do the rage (37:44 - 37:50)
like (37:47 - 37:53)
uh (37:50 - 37:53)
uh my my issue with with (37:54 - 37:59)
what this could be is (37:57 - 38:01)
okay i'm at the park i've done the three (37:59 - 38:03)
hours (38:01 - 38:05)
there's seven gyms here (38:03 - 38:09)
only one of the gyms is doing dino (38:05 - 38:11)
and then we do the dino and then none of (38:09 - 38:15)
the other gyms spawn dino (38:11 - 38:15)
like that is my issue like is that is (38:15 - 38:18)
that gonna happen because like he means (38:16 - 38:20)
wireless oh so yeah sorry that was (38:18 - 38:22)
wireless that's like why would we care (38:20 - 38:24)
about data we said (38:22 - 38:25)
i can control i can control how many (38:24 - 38:27)
wireless raids i'm doing (38:25 - 38:29)
i can't control what where or when (38:27 - 38:31)
they're appearing (38:29 - 38:33)
and that has always been my issue with (38:31 - 38:35)
community day is if i'm at the park for (38:33 - 38:36)
three hours and there's seven gyms and (38:35 - 38:38)
throughout that entire three hours only (38:36 - 38:41)
two raids have spawned and it's like (38:38 - 38:45)
uh geodude and neato queen like (38:41 - 38:47)
i don't want to do those like (38:45 - 38:48)
like (38:47 - 38:50)
again niantic just like grab the (38:48 - 38:52)
legendary lever and just crank it up (38:50 - 38:54)
during commute day because like that's (38:52 - 38:57)
easy money for you people are out (38:54 - 38:59)
they're gonna jump into it (38:57 - 39:02)
you should walk to another gym it's only (38:59 - 39:03)
50 miles (39:02 - 39:05)
got it okay okay (39:03 - 39:07)
uh did we answer all the that person's (39:05 - 39:09)
questions um list them off again i think (39:07 - 39:11)
so (39:09 - 39:13)
can you help understand how scaling back (39:11 - 39:14)
everything incense three hours community (39:13 - 39:16)
removing remote raids actually helps (39:14 - 39:19)
niantic uh the three hour community days (39:16 - 39:20)
is (39:19 - 39:21)
what niantic has said i will give you (39:20 - 39:23)
what niantica said the three hour (39:21 - 39:26)
commute days is to force more people to (39:23 - 39:28)
play at the same time which goes back to (39:26 - 39:30)
people saying they don't have a (39:28 - 39:33)
community therefore forcing everyone to (39:30 - 39:35)
play at the same time will restore that (39:33 - 39:36)
community (39:35 - 39:38)
the incense (39:36 - 39:41)
actually is the same reason it forces (39:38 - 39:42)
people to go to a park instead of (39:41 - 39:45)
playing at home which gives you the (39:42 - 39:47)
sense of community removing the remote (39:45 - 39:49)
raid passes only specifically for his (39:47 - 39:50)
wireless i (39:49 - 39:52)
think is the most logical like you don't (39:50 - 39:54)
want to remote right into these anyways (39:52 - 39:57)
it forces you to go out because like (39:54 - 40:01)
again if you are working from 6 a.m to 2 (39:57 - 40:02)
p.m and you're literally getting off (40:01 - 40:04)
work when community ends you can go to a (40:02 - 40:06)
park (40:04 - 40:08)
meet up with a friend ideally (40:06 - 40:11)
a community maybe and then be able to (40:08 - 40:13)
get yours wireless (40:11 - 40:14)
uh that way (40:13 - 40:16)
so (40:14 - 40:17)
all of your (40:16 - 40:20)
questions goes to niantic desperately (40:17 - 40:23)
trying to force people to play (40:20 - 40:26)
together when playing together seeing (40:23 - 40:28)
what groups of people do as far as (40:26 - 40:29)
advertising where they visit where they (40:28 - 40:31)
spend is really valuable information so (40:29 - 40:33)
if they get a bunch of people doing that (40:31 - 40:35)
for three hours (40:33 - 40:37)
that information is way more valuable (40:35 - 40:39)
than a bunch of people (40:37 - 40:41)
information so this game has existed for (40:39 - 40:44)
six years what what way that is people's (40:41 - 40:45)
patterns change over six years (40:44 - 40:47)
especially post pandemics that's true (40:45 - 40:48)
that's true (40:47 - 40:50)
so yeah getting people to clump together (40:48 - 40:51)
and then i'll make a decision to see (40:50 - 40:54)
what's popular is a great advertising (40:51 - 40:56)
sale one way that i frame this that's (40:54 - 40:57)
not (40:56 - 40:59)
dark state greg (40:57 - 41:00)
um (40:59 - 41:00)
yeah (41:00 - 41:01)
i don't know (41:00 - 41:04)
like seriously (41:01 - 41:06)
pandemic but we got like (41:04 - 41:08)
so one way that i like to think about it (41:06 - 41:09)
or i like to think that niantic is (41:08 - 41:11)
thinking about it in a more beneficial (41:09 - 41:12)
less (41:11 - 41:14)
uh (41:12 - 41:17)
evil way um is that they want community (41:14 - 41:18)
day (41:17 - 41:21)
and they want their events to be (41:18 - 41:24)
similar to like a concert or a play (41:21 - 41:27)
right something you go to and experience (41:24 - 41:31)
as a group not a television show sit at (41:27 - 41:33)
home and watch it on your own (41:31 - 41:35)
they want it to be an event that you (41:33 - 41:38)
schedule you go to you experience as a (41:35 - 41:40)
group and that's why they're trying to (41:38 - 41:42)
architect it so that it functions in (41:40 - 41:44)
that way (41:42 - 41:44)
that's it yeah they do want it to be a (41:46 - 41:49)
thing where like (41:48 - 41:52)
i text (41:49 - 41:54)
i text greg and will being like (41:52 - 41:56)
what are we doing for community day like (41:54 - 41:58)
leave it on read but (41:56 - 42:00)
no it's not even like it's not even with (41:58 - 42:03)
your friends right if i want to go see a (42:00 - 42:06)
show at first avenue i don't have to (42:03 - 42:09)
tell the 499 other people who want to (42:06 - 42:11)
see that band hey we've got to all go to (42:09 - 42:13)
first avenue (42:11 - 42:15)
we just know right that's a good place (42:13 - 42:18)
to see a good show or to see the band or (42:15 - 42:20)
let's you know in the pokemon terms to (42:18 - 42:22)
get the pokemon that i'm looking for (42:20 - 42:23)
right and we're all going to be in that (42:22 - 42:25)
same place because it's an event and (42:23 - 42:29)
it's a shared experience event (42:25 - 42:29)
i think the wireless raids are good i (42:33 - 42:36)
like a good concept (42:35 - 42:38)
i don't know how they will look in (42:36 - 42:39)
execution (42:38 - 42:42)
um (42:39 - 42:42)
i guess we'll find out i don't know if (42:42 - 42:47)
can you just change zwielis raids until (42:44 - 42:49)
like 3 a.m like is there gonna be that (42:47 - 42:50)
one player (42:49 - 42:52)
oh there's gonna be that one player wait (42:50 - 42:54)
i thought raids turned off at a certain (42:52 - 42:55)
time of the day they they yeah they do (42:54 - 42:56)
um (42:55 - 42:58)
i'm just saying like (42:56 - 43:01)
i mean if community ends at two (42:58 - 43:04)
all right how long is a single person (43:01 - 43:06)
going to chain (43:04 - 43:08)
zwielus you know there's gonna be one (43:06 - 43:10)
person that tries to i'm sure but (43:08 - 43:11)
uh (43:10 - 43:14)
i i think it's (43:11 - 43:14)
i i i'm glad they're trying something (43:15 - 43:17)
new (43:16 - 43:20)
uh i'm sure it will break (43:17 - 43:22)
uh who knows if they'll stick around (43:20 - 43:23)
with it (43:22 - 43:25)
even you know i was thinking of like (43:23 - 43:27)
even if they do the thing of (43:25 - 43:29)
you can either play at 11 i was thinking (43:27 - 43:31)
like you remember the ticket where it (43:29 - 43:33)
was like i want to play normal easy hard (43:31 - 43:35)
i want to do catching battling or (43:33 - 43:36)
whatever (43:35 - 43:37)
i could definitely see them in the (43:36 - 43:39)
future doing like (43:37 - 43:41)
pick your time for community do you want (43:39 - 43:42)
to play in the morning or do you want to (43:41 - 43:44)
play in the afternoon but (43:42 - 43:46)
i i feel like you're still going to get (43:44 - 43:48)
it would be better right obviously more (43:46 - 43:50)
choices are better but you're still (43:48 - 43:51)
going to get the amount of people being (43:50 - 43:53)
like i can't play any of these times i (43:51 - 43:54)
work on saturdays why isn't it sunday (43:53 - 43:57)
like (43:54 - 43:59)
it's a tough thing to do when you have a (43:57 - 44:00)
global game (43:59 - 44:02)
and you're saying the whole world played (44:00 - 44:04)
11 to 2 in your time zone (44:02 - 44:06)
and (44:04 - 44:09)
not everyone can so (44:06 - 44:10)
uh (44:09 - 44:14)
maybe the the zoelis relieves a lot of (44:10 - 44:16)
that stuff (44:14 - 44:18)
uh for at least being like hey me and my (44:16 - 44:20)
wife we have a kid we weren't able to go (44:18 - 44:23)
out we can go to target there's this (44:20 - 44:24)
wireless right here we'll do this (44:23 - 44:26)
wireless raid now we can catch dinos as (44:24 - 44:28)
we're trying to pick out a new espresso (44:26 - 44:31)
machine at target like (44:28 - 44:33)
that is a new possibility that did not (44:31 - 44:35)
exist before (44:33 - 44:37)
by assuming that that assuming that that (44:35 - 44:38)
target has a wireless right you know (44:37 - 44:41)
like yeah assuming (44:38 - 44:42)
i don't know how often those wireless (44:41 - 44:44)
are going to spawn so that's kind of (44:42 - 44:46)
like the my worry about it is like i (44:44 - 44:48)
want to do it but the raids aren't (44:46 - 44:49)
happening (44:48 - 44:51)
and and if it makes your mind feel (44:49 - 44:53)
better think of it like say it's the the (44:51 - 44:56)
tour touring performances of moulin (44:53 - 44:58)
rouge right no matter how much you want (44:56 - 45:00)
that to be at a time that's convenient (44:58 - 45:01)
for you the theater is only going to (45:00 - 45:02)
have it (45:01 - 45:04)
at one particular time when all the (45:02 - 45:06)
actors and everybody can get together (45:04 - 45:07)
well (45:06 - 45:11)
two times on wednesdays and sundays okay (45:07 - 45:14)
yeah but then you get the understudies (45:11 - 45:17)
not necessarily (45:14 - 45:20)
look matinees are (45:17 - 45:20)
boy (45:20 - 45:25)
matinees are matinees (45:22 - 45:25)
uh let's take a break uh we got a bunch (45:26 - 45:30)
of non-pokemon good news to talk about (45:28 - 45:34)
so we will be right back (45:30 - 45:37)
and we are back from our break (45:34 - 45:40)
this is off pokemon.com dell fox and (45:37 - 45:45)
season 8 battle pass are now available (45:40 - 45:49)
uh fennekin breaks in and dealt braxton (45:45 - 45:50)
breaks in braxton (45:49 - 45:52)
breaks in (45:50 - 45:53)
uh (45:52 - 45:55)
fennek evolves at level three (45:53 - 45:57)
oh sorry learns willow wisp and ember at (45:55 - 45:59)
level one and three (45:57 - 46:01)
um evolves at level four (45:59 - 46:03)
then evolves again into del fox at level (46:01 - 46:06)
six that seems like really low actually (46:03 - 46:09)
yeah i feel like it's low garchomp (46:06 - 46:13)
oh boy is dale fox powerful right (46:09 - 46:15)
now uh (46:13 - 46:17)
dull fox says fire blast uh ember can be (46:15 - 46:20)
upgraded to mystic fire at level seven (46:17 - 46:22)
willows can either change into fire spin (46:20 - 46:24)
or flame charge (46:22 - 46:29)
del fox unite move is called fin (46:24 - 46:29)
um (46:33 - 46:36)
the show-stopping attack deals damage (46:34 - 46:38)
over time to opposing pokemon within the (46:36 - 46:40)
effective area the opposing pokemon (46:38 - 46:42)
damage by fanciful fireworks have their (46:40 - 46:45)
movement speed decreased and their hp (46:42 - 46:48)
recovery effects weaken for a short time (46:45 - 46:50)
um (46:48 - 46:54)
it see it's a ranged attacker (46:50 - 46:55)
so that would be the same classification (46:54 - 46:58)
as like a cinder race or uh like a lot (46:55 - 47:00)
of things right now in that game but (46:58 - 47:02)
decidueye nine tails (47:00 - 47:05)
uh who else is rambling (47:02 - 47:06)
uh (47:05 - 47:08)
like um there's so many ranged attacker (47:06 - 47:11)
and we and we don't have another (47:08 - 47:13)
speedster yet (47:11 - 47:14)
still (47:13 - 47:16)
they only have four (47:14 - 47:19)
and because it's a useless (47:16 - 47:21)
class like it's it's they're just (47:19 - 47:24)
attackers but like slightly less health (47:21 - 47:26)
slightly (47:24 - 47:30)
but they go fast they're like sonic (47:26 - 47:32)
i would say that there is a useless (47:30 - 47:33)
class because there's still a lot of (47:32 - 47:35)
people that play them and do very well (47:33 - 47:37)
in in the jungle area (47:35 - 47:39)
yeah but like (47:37 - 47:41)
the amount of cinder aces or other (47:39 - 47:43)
attackers like venusaur that just do (47:41 - 47:46)
jungle instead like there's no there's (47:43 - 47:47)
really no disadvantage to putting an (47:46 - 47:50)
attacker in a jungle (47:47 - 47:50)
uh delphi i will say it del fox's op (47:51 - 47:56)
right now (47:53 - 47:58)
uh i'm (47:56 - 48:02)
happy at least the takes they have on (47:58 - 48:06)
the moves are somewhat (48:02 - 48:06)
i haven't seen them on other pokemon (48:06 - 48:10)
i'll say that at least in this way fire (48:08 - 48:12)
blast that shoots forward and then the (48:10 - 48:15)
trail at least behind it explodes (48:12 - 48:16)
uh which is fun but the one that (48:15 - 48:18)
everybody likes is when you're trying to (48:16 - 48:21)
run away from fire spin because it just (48:18 - 48:23)
follows you (48:21 - 48:25)
does it charizard have fire spin like (48:23 - 48:27)
i've i've sat in a charizard's fire spin (48:25 - 48:29)
and been like oh well this sucks but (48:27 - 48:31)
does the fire fit spot does it follow (48:29 - 48:33)
you around the (48:31 - 48:35)
it sits on the map and like burns so you (48:33 - 48:37)
like blocks the spot (48:35 - 48:39)
this one you launch it at somebody if (48:37 - 48:41)
they aren't in it it follows them it (48:39 - 48:43)
tracks this (48:41 - 48:46)
fireworks it does that no oh it's fire (48:43 - 48:47)
spin (48:46 - 48:50)
so like if i see a venusaur here and (48:47 - 48:52)
they're running i can put the fire spin (48:50 - 48:54)
here and it follows them just nicking (48:52 - 48:56)
their heels and if they get caught in it (48:54 - 48:58)
it spins them around (48:56 - 49:00)
whereas the big fire blast on the ground (48:58 - 49:01)
that (49:00 - 49:03)
uh (49:01 - 49:05)
charizard does doesn't move it's just a (49:03 - 49:06)
big place it's just like damage over (49:05 - 49:08)
time yeah (49:06 - 49:10)
fire sprint is (49:08 - 49:13)
wild i love it of course everybody's (49:10 - 49:14)
playing delphox right now so i i've (49:13 - 49:17)
gotten to play del fox in a match twice (49:14 - 49:19)
yeah it's like the doraldon problem (49:17 - 49:20)
where like literally everyone was (49:19 - 49:22)
running doralodon because it was so (49:20 - 49:25)
powerful yeah and also i i i did play (49:22 - 49:28)
unite like a week ago greg they did not (49:25 - 49:30)
fix the doraldon's sound (49:28 - 49:33)
when it makes when it attacks it's so (49:30 - 49:36)
much louder than everyone else's (49:33 - 49:37)
and like (49:36 - 49:39)
and even even if you're not like i'm not (49:37 - 49:41)
playing duraladon it's just the other (49:39 - 49:44)
duraladons on the field that like it's (49:41 - 49:47)
so triggering how loud it is very loud (49:44 - 49:49)
it is still very loud uh i mean i (49:47 - 49:52)
generally just turn (49:49 - 49:52)
whenever i'm playing it it turns sound (49:52 - 49:56)
way down anyways because there's nothing (49:54 - 49:57)
in there that i want (49:56 - 49:59)
there's almost none of the sounds that i (49:57 - 50:02)
want i i'm fine having it just low level (49:59 - 50:03)
quiet (50:02 - 50:04)
um (50:03 - 50:07)
there is no way i say this (50:04 - 50:10)
i highly doubt we are not going to see (50:07 - 50:12)
some sort of nerf (50:10 - 50:14)
come to this character (50:12 - 50:17)
even like even like reading it and not (50:14 - 50:18)
seeing it in action the fact that it (50:17 - 50:21)
evolves at six yeah (50:18 - 50:23)
like i feel like gardevoir is like eight (50:21 - 50:24)
garchomp is like (50:23 - 50:27)
gardevoir is at eight and i think they (50:24 - 50:28)
think they were (50:27 - 50:30)
going to lower guard over or they did (50:28 - 50:31)
lower gardevoir because it was really (50:30 - 50:32)
bad (50:31 - 50:35)
but yeah it evolves fast and the two (50:32 - 50:37)
attacks that at level six fire blast is (50:35 - 50:38)
huge (50:37 - 50:40)
and then at seven it gets fire spin and (50:38 - 50:42)
it's just (50:40 - 50:45)
it's a monster right now it's a fun (50:42 - 50:49)
monster but it is a monster right now (50:45 - 50:49)
i haven't i don't think i've ever seen (50:50 - 50:53)
anybody yet (50:52 - 50:56)
use mystical fire or flame charge like (50:53 - 50:58)
i've not even seen why would you pick (50:56 - 51:01)
those because why would you yeah (50:58 - 51:03)
i mean that's the nerf that i think is (51:01 - 51:04)
coming they're either going they're (51:03 - 51:07)
going to bump those others down so that (51:04 - 51:09)
the other options two moves are picked (51:07 - 51:10)
all right so that you least feel like (51:09 - 51:12)
you have a choice but this is not a (51:10 - 51:14)
unite thing though this is like every (51:12 - 51:17)
moba every every moba hero shooter is (51:14 - 51:18)
like the new character is overpowered (51:17 - 51:20)
because they want people to buy it (51:18 - 51:22)
oh yeah (51:20 - 51:24)
it's funny because they didn't really (51:22 - 51:26)
overpower s-ban and they gave espn away (51:24 - 51:28)
for free (51:26 - 51:31)
but they overpowered dell fox for money (51:28 - 51:33)
how much is it ten thousand ten thousand (51:31 - 51:35)
points yeah i was hitting on 36 000 (51:33 - 51:38)
coins i was like bye (51:35 - 51:39)
yeah (51:38 - 51:40)
uh (51:39 - 51:42)
this is off (51:40 - 51:43)
kotaku (51:42 - 51:46)

this is a little clicky yeah yeah yeah (52:05 - 52:08)
yeah yeah (52:06 - 52:10)
anybody who's been paying attention has (52:08 - 52:12)
noticed that he's been shifting his (52:10 - 52:15)
position over the past like (52:12 - 52:19)
eight years oh yeah (52:15 - 52:19)
hardcore shifting like x and y was the (52:20 - 52:24)
last (52:22 - 52:27)
main series game he directed (52:24 - 52:29)
which was (52:27 - 52:30)

there he did direct let's go pikachu (52:34 - 52:38)
let's go eevee his main series and he (52:36 - 52:40)
did direct that but that is that is a (52:38 - 52:43)
remake i'm i was talking like brand new (52:40 - 52:45)
world right (52:43 - 52:47)
uh that was x and y (52:45 - 52:49)
um (52:47 - 52:49)
uh (52:50 - 52:53)
masuda's game freaks former managing (52:51 - 52:54)
director has stepped down from the (52:53 - 52:56)
company's role (52:54 - 52:59)
uh to take up a far new senior position (52:56 - 53:01)
at the pokemon company (52:59 - 53:04)
as a chief creative fellow (53:01 - 53:05)
masuda had a pivotal role in creating (53:04 - 53:07)
the development of the pokemon franchise (53:05 - 53:09)
he was a programmer on pokemon red and (53:07 - 53:10)
blue (53:09 - 53:12)
he then became to (53:10 - 53:14)
the director of mainline series games (53:12 - 53:16)
from ruby and sapphire to pokemon x and (53:14 - 53:18)
y i think he also directed (53:16 - 53:20)
black and white (53:18 - 53:23)
if i remember correctly (53:20 - 53:25)
but isn't that saying (53:23 - 53:27)
from ruby and sapphire all the way (53:25 - 53:28)
through no because he didn't direct (53:27 - 53:30)
every game in between i see um like (53:28 - 53:33)
amore directed black two white two (53:30 - 53:34)
and then (53:33 - 53:36)
uh somebody else i can't remember the (53:34 - 53:38)
guy who directed platinum (53:36 - 53:38)
um (53:38 - 53:39)
anyways (53:38 - 53:42)
uh alongside these roles he frequently (53:39 - 53:44)
created the music for the series 2 (53:42 - 53:46)
as well as being directly involved in (53:44 - 53:48)
naming some uh naming and designing many (53:46 - 53:50)
of the monsters i don't know about (53:48 - 53:52)
designing many of the monsters i don't (53:50 - 53:54)
actually know that kotaku i think that (53:52 - 53:56)
is slightly incorrect he is now extended (53:54 - 53:58)
from a more powerful position with more (53:56 - 54:00)
responsibilities as pokemon as a (53:58 - 54:03)
pokemon franchise as a whole (54:00 - 54:05)
uh the developer worked on every main (54:03 - 54:08)
line game in some capacity that is true (54:05 - 54:11)
and even the person who wrote the base (54:08 - 54:12)
game concept documentation for pokemon (54:11 - 54:14)
go that is also true a lot of people i (54:12 - 54:16)
don't think know this but masuda was the (54:14 - 54:17)
one that (54:16 - 54:20)
uh made like the the touchscreen this is (54:17 - 54:22)
an audio podcast this work this doesn't (54:20 - 54:24)
work even on video but like the the (54:22 - 54:26)
swirly (54:24 - 54:28)
fling the pokeball with your finger that (54:26 - 54:30)
was like his concept didn't he also make (54:28 - 54:34)
the music for go fest (54:30 - 54:36)
yes he made all the sounds that you hear (54:34 - 54:38)
in pokemon go the ones that you turn off (54:36 - 54:40)
yeah yeah because they're terrible (54:38 - 54:43)
uh in 2018 masuda made it clear that he (54:40 - 54:45)
was ready to move on from directing (54:43 - 54:46)
pokemon titles telling the official (54:45 - 54:48)
pokemon website that let's go pikachu on (54:46 - 54:50)
sko evie was the last time he would be (54:48 - 54:51)
at the helm (54:50 - 54:53)
he wanted the younger generation at game (54:51 - 54:55)
freak to get a chance with the series (54:53 - 54:57)
four years later he has officially left (54:55 - 54:59)
the studio but not the franchise taking (54:57 - 55:01)
on the splendid title of the pokemon (54:59 - 55:03)
company's chief creative fellow which (55:01 - 55:06)
sounds like it would be a rank up (55:03 - 55:07)
where it seems like his role will be (55:06 - 55:09)
continuing to innovate the approach of (55:07 - 55:11)
the pocket monsters this new title gives (55:09 - 55:12)
him far greater responsibility for (55:11 - 55:14)
pokemon overall including the card game (55:12 - 55:17)
screen adaptations adaptations of brand (55:14 - 55:20)
management etc (55:17 - 55:23)
uh the big step up like (55:20 - 55:26)
that i mean that is a huge (55:23 - 55:27)
job (55:26 - 55:29)
promotion uh (55:27 - 55:31)
i don't know i kind of see it in a (55:29 - 55:35)
different way i see it more as it's it's (55:31 - 55:38)
like he's like i'm ready to retire and (55:35 - 55:39)
they're like well we don't want to lose (55:38 - 55:42)
you so let's put you into this position (55:39 - 55:45)
where you can consult on a lot of things (55:42 - 55:47)
but you don't (55:45 - 55:49)
you don't have to produce (55:47 - 55:51)
right (55:49 - 55:52)
you you can give your input but you (55:51 - 55:55)
don't have deliverables that's a huge (55:52 - 55:57)
promotion incorporation (55:55 - 55:58)
we're gonna put you into a spot where we (55:57 - 56:00)
pay you a lot of money and you barely (55:58 - 56:02)
have to work yeah it's it's that we (56:00 - 56:03)
don't want to lose it but it's not like (56:02 - 56:05)
the oh he's going to be this big (56:03 - 56:07)
decision maybe no he's going to set the (56:05 - 56:09)
direction for where pogba (56:07 - 56:11)
no it's it's like we don't want to lose (56:09 - 56:13)
you we value your input so we will (56:11 - 56:15)
continue to pay you (56:13 - 56:18)
without a lot of having to like give us (56:15 - 56:21)
a soundtrack every two years and all (56:18 - 56:23)
that kind of stuff yeah (56:21 - 56:27)
i think that this is a very specific (56:23 - 56:27)
future (56:27 - 56:31)
thing that they're prepping for (56:29 - 56:33)
so (56:31 - 56:35)
he (56:33 - 56:38)
was directly involved in brilliant (56:35 - 56:39)
diamond shining pearl (56:38 - 56:41)
in some capacity we don't know what it (56:39 - 56:42)
was (56:41 - 56:43)
but they gave brilliant diamond shining (56:42 - 56:44)
for (56:43 - 56:45)
ilka (56:44 - 56:48)
unfortunately and then they put masuda (56:45 - 56:50)
to be like hey watch these people make (56:48 - 56:52)
this game (56:50 - 56:54)
and at some point he would have had to (56:52 - 56:57)
say yes this is good enough ship it (56:54 - 56:59)
and i think that that's what they needed (56:57 - 57:02)
going forward they needed a person (56:59 - 57:04)
to look at these games that game freak (57:02 - 57:08)
is not doing and say is this good enough (57:04 - 57:10)
you would know you've worked on all (57:08 - 57:11)
these games (57:10 - 57:14)
so if anything this to me is (57:11 - 57:17)
we need game freak to continue making (57:14 - 57:18)
new pokemon games but we need to (57:17 - 57:21)
continue double dipping (57:18 - 57:24)
and go and producing other pokemon games (57:21 - 57:26)
because we need this constant flow of (57:24 - 57:28)
pokemon games (57:26 - 57:30)
and we needed a person (57:28 - 57:32)
to look over the other companies that (57:30 - 57:35)
will be making these other games (57:32 - 57:37)
so if anything it's like a consistency (57:35 - 57:38)
officer (57:37 - 57:40)
yeah so if anything it's it's (57:38 - 57:42)
to me it's (57:40 - 57:44)
we definitely know (57:42 - 57:46)
i shouldn't say definitely (57:44 - 57:48)
in my opinion (57:46 - 57:49)
it is (57:48 - 57:52)
that game freak is not making a die a (57:49 - 57:55)
black and white three or a a (57:52 - 57:58)
remake of black and white it is another (57:55 - 58:00)
company whether that's ilka or somebody (57:58 - 58:03)
else is making that when that time comes (58:00 - 58:06)
and masuda is in a position where (58:03 - 58:08)
he will be overseeing it at the pokemon (58:06 - 58:09)
company (58:08 - 58:10)
because (58:09 - 58:12)
game freak shouldn't technically be (58:10 - 58:14)
overseeing (58:12 - 58:16)
another pokemon project (58:14 - 58:17)
it would be the pokemon company that (58:16 - 58:19)
would be overseeing a pokemon project (58:17 - 58:21)
because (58:19 - 58:22)
right yeah gameplay (58:21 - 58:22)
like game freak didn't go over to pokken (58:22 - 58:25)
tournament and be like how are you guys (58:24 - 58:28)
doing over there uh bandai namco like no (58:25 - 58:30)
the pokemon company was the the people (58:28 - 58:33)
that went over there (58:30 - 58:35)
that's that's what i think they put him (58:33 - 58:37)
in a position where they they are now (58:35 - 58:39)
more comfortable with non-game freak (58:37 - 58:41)
pokemon games and he's going to oversee (58:39 - 58:44)
that (58:41 - 58:44)
that's what i think yeah that makes (58:45 - 58:48)
sense (58:47 - 58:50)
i don't i think that's good and bad (58:48 - 58:53)
right like i think i think it's (58:50 - 58:56)
good that (58:53 - 58:56)
game freak doesn't have to over extend (58:56 - 59:02)
and try to make six games at once (58:59 - 59:04)
um i think it's bad that we've learned (59:02 - 59:07)
that ilka (59:04 - 59:07)
really dropped the ball hard on just (59:07 - 59:10)
remaking a game (59:09 - 59:12)
yeah it was the first it was the first (59:10 - 59:14)
one yeah it was their first one (59:12 - 59:16)
um (59:14 - 59:19)
it was a faithful (59:16 - 59:20)
remake (59:19 - 59:22)
it was you know that there was some (59:20 - 59:26)
faithfulness to that remake indeed (59:22 - 59:26)
minus the uh (59:27 - 59:33)
anyways (59:30 - 59:35)
good for him though uh (59:33 - 59:38)
good for him moving up i (59:35 - 59:40)
i don't think that's i i think for the (59:38 - 59:43)
average pokemon fan that means literally (59:40 - 59:44)
nothing nah (59:43 - 59:47)
i mean these are sort of internal (59:44 - 59:50)
shuffling and internal (59:47 - 59:52)
divisions of labor that are really wild (59:50 - 59:56)
and complicated and mostly will do (59:52 - 59:56)
nothing for yeah and i don't think (59:56 - 60:00)
they're i don't think there was a (59:59 - 60:02)
situation before that where he wasn't (60:00 - 60:04)
just involved in all this stuff yeah (60:02 - 60:06)
like he is a very powerful he was a very (60:04 - 60:09)
powerful game freak employee (60:06 - 60:10)
like when people think of pokemon they (60:09 - 60:12)
think of masuda which is funny because (60:10 - 60:14)
like masuda got blamed for a lot of (60:12 - 60:17)
stuff around sword and shield (60:14 - 60:19)
um even though he wasn't the director of (60:17 - 60:20)
sword and shield (60:19 - 60:23)
and like no one ever blames ishihara the (60:20 - 60:26)
president and ceo of the pokemon company (60:23 - 60:27)
like (60:26 - 60:29)
ishihara's name is rarely ever brought (60:27 - 60:32)
up like omori's name is rarely ever (60:29 - 60:35)
brought up even though amore directed (60:32 - 60:38)
sun and moon black and what like (60:35 - 60:40)
like sword and shield like no one brings (60:38 - 60:42)
up mud mori no one brings up ishihara (60:40 - 60:44)
sometimes people bring up sugamori but (60:42 - 60:46)
they're literally bringing up sukumari (60:44 - 60:48)
for his art style like masuda's name is (60:46 - 60:49)
the name that gets brought up time and (60:48 - 60:53)
time again even though (60:49 - 60:54)
he doesn't he (60:53 - 60:57)
didn't work on specific games (60:54 - 60:59)
um (60:57 - 61:01)
yeah but he has a method named after him (60:59 - 61:04)
and that's the problem yeah that's true (61:01 - 61:06)
when you get a method named after you (61:04 - 61:08)
you are going to be the (61:06 - 61:08)
the (61:08 - 61:11)
the point that everybody is like that's (61:08 - 61:13)
the problem this method (61:11 - 61:15)
and it's masudus method (61:13 - 61:18)
i'm waiting for the amore method (61:15 - 61:20)
what is that going to be (61:18 - 61:22)
hopefully soon (61:20 - 61:24)
this i think you know i i thought the (61:22 - 61:25)
masuda (61:24 - 61:27)
getting a job change was a pretty big (61:25 - 61:30)
deal at least for our show because we're (61:27 - 61:32)
more hardcore fans here (61:30 - 61:34)
but i think this really like this really (61:32 - 61:37)
blindsided me here this is off nintendo (61:34 - 61:40)
life former pokemon art director reveals (61:37 - 61:43)
plucky squire his first game from his (61:40 - 61:44)
new studio (61:43 - 61:46)
again this is wild to me (61:44 - 61:49)
yesterday pokemon artist james turner (61:46 - 61:50)
known in recent times as the art (61:49 - 61:52)
director of pokemon sword and shield and (61:50 - 61:55)
announced he moved on from game freak (61:52 - 61:57)

enough the game was revealed during (62:12 - 62:17)
devolver digital's latest presentation (62:14 - 62:20)
devolver digital is uh their publisher (62:17 - 62:22)
of games (62:20 - 62:24)
and in my opinion i think they publish (62:22 - 62:26)
pretty good games honestly they have a (62:24 - 62:27)
pretty good track record if you look at (62:26 - 62:28)
their game library of what they've (62:27 - 62:31)
published (62:28 - 62:33)
the game is called plucky squire it's (62:31 - 62:35)
launching on all platforms including the (62:33 - 62:39)
nintendo switch in 2023 (62:35 - 62:41)
uh it follows the magic adventures of (62:39 - 62:43)
jot and his friends the storybook (62:41 - 62:44)
characters who discovered there's a (62:43 - 62:46)
three-dimensional world beyond the pages (62:44 - 62:48)
of their book when a villain kicks them (62:46 - 62:50)
out players will be able to jump between (62:48 - 62:53)
2 3 and 3d worlds in the action (62:50 - 62:56)
adventure while solving puzzles boxing (62:53 - 62:58)
badgers and even flying around on a jet (62:56 - 62:59)
pack (62:58 - 63:03)
it's really hard to describe this (62:59 - 63:05)
please watch the trailer the trailer is (63:03 - 63:06)
great (63:05 - 63:09)
um is it like reverse paper mario (63:06 - 63:12)
kind of (63:09 - 63:13)
it's it's (63:12 - 63:16)
it's it looks awesome yeah it looks like (63:13 - 63:19)
a beautiful game and honestly like (63:16 - 63:21)
good for him like what the old adage is (63:19 - 63:23)
you'll never get rich working for (63:21 - 63:25)
somebody else so (63:23 - 63:27)
like start your own thing make your own (63:25 - 63:28)
stuff (63:27 - 63:29)
awesome like you got a ton of great (63:28 - 63:31)
experience he's gonna turn that into his (63:29 - 63:34)
own great company hopefully i'm like (63:31 - 63:35)
cool (63:34 - 63:38)
it is it is so (63:35 - 63:40)
like from from the screenshot of the (63:38 - 63:43)
plucky squire to the characters to the (63:40 - 63:45)
like everything in the screenshot is (63:43 - 63:48)
screams his art style and if you (63:45 - 63:49)
followed him on twitter or instagram he (63:48 - 63:51)
has a very specific art style (63:49 - 63:54)
and he has created over 20 pokemon for (63:51 - 63:57)
the series he's created vanillite (63:54 - 64:00)
trevident uh buzzwall um (63:57 - 64:01)
[Music] (64:00 - 64:04)
guzzlord poiple (64:01 - 64:05)
uh (64:04 - 64:08)
gallerian zigzagoon line when i say like (64:05 - 64:10)
poiple i mean the whole line when i say (64:08 - 64:12)
vanillite i mean the whole line amanda (64:10 - 64:14)
buzz golurk (64:12 - 64:17)
he's created over 20 pokemon (64:14 - 64:18)
those and the ones i just named are the (64:17 - 64:21)
ones we know for sure he created because (64:18 - 64:23)
he has said that at a certain point (64:21 - 64:25)
uh the pokemon company was not happy (64:23 - 64:27)
with with (64:25 - 64:30)
him and other designers saying what (64:27 - 64:31)
they've created (64:30 - 64:33)
and i think it's not because like (64:31 - 64:36)
i think it's mostly they want (64:33 - 64:37)
when you look at a pokemon they want you (64:36 - 64:39)
to think like oh it came from the same (64:37 - 64:43)
place right um not like oh these well (64:39 - 64:44)
and they also don't want people being (64:43 - 64:46)
targeted like oh you designed charizard (64:44 - 64:47)
and (64:46 - 64:50)
evie oh well i hate charizard and evie (64:47 - 64:52)
so i dislike all like they just it's (64:50 - 64:56)
mostly like a protection thing um (64:52 - 64:58)
but if you ever follow if you follow (64:56 - 64:59)
james turner on twitter or whatnot and (64:58 - 65:01)
you've seen his art style it's it's it's (64:59 - 65:04)
very specific it's very uh simple clean (65:01 - 65:07)
thicker lines kind of stuff and (65:04 - 65:09)
the whole like comic book or sorry (65:07 - 65:12)
adventure book is is a million percent (65:09 - 65:13)
his art style the title screen and (65:12 - 65:14)
everything (65:13 - 65:17)
there is a if if you dig a little bit (65:14 - 65:19)
deeper and you go to um (65:17 - 65:21)
the twitter for (65:19 - 65:23)
uh all possible features and you see the (65:21 - 65:24)
people that they're following you can (65:23 - 65:27)
see you can find like the other (65:24 - 65:29)
designers and developers and there's (65:27 - 65:30)
like i think it's a good team of six (65:29 - 65:33)
right now (65:30 - 65:33)
good for him the game looks great it (65:35 - 65:39)
looks like a day one purchase for me um (65:37 - 65:41)
it looks like very adventure game i (65:39 - 65:43)
don't know like (65:41 - 65:45)
zelda adventure game i don't know it (65:43 - 65:47)
kind of looks a little linear but that's (65:45 - 65:48)
based off like a two minute trailer yeah (65:47 - 65:51)
it's really hard to say (65:48 - 65:54)
from the trailer how much (65:51 - 65:56)
back and for like because it kind of (65:54 - 65:57)
makes it seem like you'll be going back (65:56 - 65:59)
and forth between the book and the other (65:57 - 66:00)
worlds like but the trailer doesn't (65:59 - 66:01)
really (66:00 - 66:03)
yeah show that because it's like the (66:01 - 66:06)
reveal trailer of what it is so i don't (66:03 - 66:07)
i honestly don't know what to expect (66:06 - 66:09)
from the game (66:07 - 66:12)
um i'm not gonna say it it was a it did (66:09 - 66:14)
what a lot of trailers haven't done for (66:12 - 66:16)
me in the last two years which is sell (66:14 - 66:18)
you on the game oh yeah (66:16 - 66:19)
i mean (66:18 - 66:21)
if it's a platformer i'm out because i (66:19 - 66:24)
don't like platformers um that's my way (66:21 - 66:26)
too i'm very bad at platformers i'll (66:24 - 66:28)
i'll wait to see what it is but like i'm (66:26 - 66:29)
actually (66:28 - 66:30)
like (66:29 - 66:32)
marking it to be like i want to go and (66:30 - 66:34)
see what this is when it actually comes (66:32 - 66:36)
out because i'm interested in this game (66:34 - 66:39)
i like puzzle platformers i don't like (66:36 - 66:40)
time (66:39 - 66:44)
like i'm not a metroid but i am a limbo (66:40 - 66:46)
ooh i like limbo (66:44 - 66:48)
it's a platformer (66:46 - 66:49)
yeah i'm not (66:48 - 66:52)
i'm not big on platformers (66:49 - 66:55)
in most iterations (66:52 - 66:58)
it is it is wild to me though that (66:55 - 67:00)
he left game freak i think that's kind (66:58 - 67:03)
of a big deal and uh it was funny (67:00 - 67:04)
because uh there was a person in my (67:03 - 67:06)
stream who (67:04 - 67:07)
you could just (67:06 - 67:09)
i very in in the five years of me (67:07 - 67:11)
streaming on twitch it's very obvious (67:09 - 67:14)
when there is um a very young person in (67:11 - 67:16)
your twitch stream because they talk in (67:14 - 67:18)
a very specific way (67:16 - 67:20)
um and or they type in a very specific (67:18 - 67:22)
way it could be that you know english is (67:20 - 67:24)
not their first language (67:22 - 67:26)
um but (67:24 - 67:28)
the history of what they said in the (67:26 - 67:29)
past (67:28 - 67:31)
they they were like i don't see how this (67:29 - 67:32)
is a big deal i've never heard of james (67:31 - 67:33)
turner (67:32 - 67:37)
[Laughter] (67:33 - 67:39)
i think for it goes back to the masuda (67:37 - 67:43)
thing i think an average pokemon fan has (67:39 - 67:44)
you're right this doesn't affect them at (67:43 - 67:47)
all but we are not making a podcast for (67:44 - 67:50)
an average pokemon fan (67:47 - 67:52)
uh i think somebody who is (67:50 - 67:54)
the first (67:52 - 67:56)
non-japanese person who has designed (67:54 - 67:59)
over 20 different pokemon the first (67:56 - 68:02)
non-japanese person in position of power (67:59 - 68:04)
at gamefreak to be an art director (68:02 - 68:06)
leaving game freak i think is a pretty (68:04 - 68:12)
big deal for oh i agree our audience and (68:06 - 68:15)
i don't think there was any ill will (68:12 - 68:17)
based on like him making the (68:15 - 68:19)
quaxly (68:17 - 68:20)
uh (68:19 - 68:23)
tortilla chip and uh (68:20 - 68:25)
cat grass cat art and all that stuff (68:23 - 68:27)
like he was really excited around the (68:25 - 68:30)
launch of scarlet violet which you would (68:27 - 68:31)
think that he was the art director for (68:30 - 68:33)
scarlet and violet because that was not (68:31 - 68:35)
talked about like he didn't his name (68:33 - 68:37)
doesn't appear at all in arceus legends (68:35 - 68:39)
um (68:37 - 68:40)
his name appears all over the crown (68:39 - 68:42)
tundra isle of armor sword and shield (68:40 - 68:43)
obviously because he was the art (68:42 - 68:45)
director there (68:43 - 68:47)
and because (68:45 - 68:50)
scarlet violet has been worked on (68:47 - 68:55)
ideally since sword and shield finished (68:50 - 68:57)
there's probably no doubt that he didn't (68:55 - 68:58)
help (68:57 - 69:00)
with the start of scarlet and violet (68:58 - 69:01)
probably not yeah (69:00 - 69:03)
and i look at i look at specific pokemon (69:01 - 69:06)
like quacksley (69:03 - 69:07)
and that looks like a james turner (69:06 - 69:09)
pokemon (69:07 - 69:11)
like out of like like (69:09 - 69:13)
there's just he makes po like if you (69:11 - 69:15)
look at plucky's choir (69:13 - 69:16)
and you see some of the stuff you're (69:15 - 69:17)
just like (69:16 - 69:19)
and then you look at other pokemon like (69:17 - 69:23)
there's like there's the the the (69:19 - 69:23)
uh (69:23 - 69:25)
the (69:24 - 69:27)
zhang goose or whatever (69:25 - 69:29)
the badger the badger you see in (69:27 - 69:31)
plucky's choir oh yeah (69:29 - 69:33)
looks like obstagoon (69:31 - 69:35)
and there there's a there's (69:33 - 69:38)
the little bugs that appear kind of look (69:35 - 69:40)
like his style for buzzwole and and (69:38 - 69:42)
poiple like they're (69:40 - 69:45)
it's really hard to explain but like he (69:42 - 69:48)
he has a very distinct style (69:45 - 69:51)
and quickly fits that style you can you (69:48 - 69:54)
can see the parallels yeah for sure (69:51 - 69:56)
it's not like he left game freak and was (69:54 - 69:58)
like i'm going to put obsta goon in my (69:56 - 69:59)
little game like it's it's just no he (69:58 - 70:01)
like draws in a specific way (69:59 - 70:03)
i'm curious why you think it's a huge (70:01 - 70:05)
huge deal (70:03 - 70:09)
i think it's a huge deal in the sense of (70:05 - 70:11)
um (70:09 - 70:13)
why wouldn't the pokemon company want to (70:11 - 70:14)
keep him (70:13 - 70:17)
well that's not really like they're off (70:14 - 70:18)
that's not their decision (70:17 - 70:21)
sure but like i feel like if if you have (70:18 - 70:24)
you know if you're like the johnny ives (70:21 - 70:25)
of apple you want to probably do (70:24 - 70:27)
everything possible to keep johnny hives (70:25 - 70:29)
i mean like (70:27 - 70:31)
right or you want to keep the tim cooks (70:29 - 70:33)
or you want to keep the you want to keep (70:31 - 70:35)
these people that are see that that (70:33 - 70:38)
doesn't that's that's not a an apples to (70:35 - 70:41)
apples right tim cooks is operations and (70:38 - 70:43)
if you want to be the head of operations (70:41 - 70:45)
for one of the largest technology (70:43 - 70:47)
companies in the world then yes you stay (70:45 - 70:50)
at apple johnny ives is creative and if (70:47 - 70:52)
he says i have reached my limit of what (70:50 - 70:55)
i can do creatively at this company it (70:52 - 70:57)
doesn't matter how much money you throw (70:55 - 70:59)
at him or whatever he's like i want to (70:57 - 71:02)
do creative things because that's what (70:59 - 71:04)
i'm passionate about and if james turner (71:02 - 71:05)
is like (71:04 - 71:10)
i i am i've mined my pokemon design (71:05 - 71:13)
you know mind empty (71:10 - 71:15)
i've got nothing left yeah in that it (71:13 - 71:17)
doesn't he's like he wants to do (71:15 - 71:19)
creative things he's clearly made enough (71:17 - 71:22)
money that he doesn't need i mean money (71:19 - 71:23)
you would think that their (71:22 - 71:25)
um that their gear project would help (71:23 - 71:27)
out with that like hey we don't want to (71:25 - 71:29)
lose you we'll put you on a gear project (71:27 - 71:31)
why why wasn't plucky squire a gear (71:29 - 71:33)
project thing like harmonite was which (71:31 - 71:36)
he worked on harmonite or um tembo the (71:33 - 71:38)
elephant which is all about their input (71:36 - 71:40)
on it which he doesn't necessarily want (71:38 - 71:41)
like (71:40 - 71:43)
i mean there's a lot of things right (71:41 - 71:45)
like one (71:43 - 71:47)
when you work for a large corporation (71:45 - 71:50)
you don't own that stuff it's not yours (71:47 - 71:51)
and if you want to make something that's (71:50 - 71:54)
yours but you're just like this is what (71:51 - 71:55)
i want and i want it to be my way and i (71:54 - 71:58)
don't want to be by a committee you're (71:55 - 71:59)
never going to get that in a corporation (71:58 - 72:01)
that's true (71:59 - 72:02)
two i was (72:01 - 72:05)
watching with a bunch of people who are (72:02 - 72:06)
non-native (72:05 - 72:08)
japanese speakers who talk about how (72:06 - 72:11)
hard it is just to advance in japanese (72:08 - 72:13)
companies because you're always having (72:11 - 72:15)
to translate you don't have the same (72:13 - 72:18)
social connections even if you're fluent (72:15 - 72:20)
there is always a barrier there that's (72:18 - 72:22)
going to limit your (72:20 - 72:24)
abilities and (72:22 - 72:26)
that is just a reality of anybody who (72:24 - 72:29)
works in two languages (72:26 - 72:31)
that there's always going to be a (72:29 - 72:33)
barrier there and whether they can (72:31 - 72:34)
compensate for (72:33 - 72:37)
as much as they can but ultimately you (72:34 - 72:39)
may just hit a point where like i don't (72:37 - 72:41)
feel like i can actually get to where i (72:39 - 72:43)
want to be in this company because (72:41 - 72:46)
there is this barrier that we've limited (72:43 - 72:48)
as much as we can but we'll never (72:46 - 72:50)
eliminate (72:48 - 72:52)
that's that's a factor it's also could (72:50 - 72:55)
be i just want to own something of my (72:52 - 72:56)
own (72:55 - 72:58)
yeah i want to be able to just do this (72:56 - 73:01)
on my own and a lot of companies have (72:58 - 73:04)
especially if you're in the same field (73:01 - 73:06)
they're not going to let you make a side (73:04 - 73:08)
project they're not (73:06 - 73:11)
you're not going to put out a competing (73:08 - 73:12)
game (73:11 - 73:14)
while you're working for a game company (73:12 - 73:16)
it's a conflict of interest (73:14 - 73:18)
right even at american universities (73:16 - 73:20)
anybody who is a professor at an (73:18 - 73:22)
american university has to sign a (73:20 - 73:23)
contract that says (73:22 - 73:26)
any intellectual property you create (73:23 - 73:29)
while you are a professor here belongs (73:26 - 73:31)
to the university does not belong to you (73:29 - 73:33)
and it doesn't matter if i'm a (73:31 - 73:35)
psychology professor and i write a book (73:33 - 73:38)
about astrology that astrology book (73:35 - 73:41)
belongs to the university (73:38 - 73:44)
i just think he he clearly did something (73:41 - 73:47)
right he clearly (73:44 - 73:47)
he pushed past those barriers that these (73:48 - 73:54)
old japanese companies put up like oh (73:51 - 73:56)
yeah he was the first non-japanese (73:54 - 73:58)
person to make a pokemon that's a huge (73:56 - 73:59)
deal like (73:58 - 74:02)
out there there's there's (73:59 - 74:04)
probably millions of people out there (74:02 - 74:06)
that want to make pokemon that that are (74:04 - 74:08)
drawing pokemon right now i mean just go (74:06 - 74:11)
to deviantart they're out there (74:08 - 74:14)
and somehow he did it (74:11 - 74:17)
he was he he was the one that got (74:14 - 74:18)
through (74:17 - 74:20)
he was the one that moved up and became (74:18 - 74:22)
the an art director of the entire (74:20 - 74:24)
project so like yeah i completely agree (74:22 - 74:26)
with you there's like language barriers (74:24 - 74:27)
even if you know japanese fluently (74:26 - 74:29)
they're still like slang they're still (74:27 - 74:31)
like you're you're still seen as like a (74:29 - 74:33)
non-japanese person they're still the (74:31 - 74:34)
struggles (74:33 - 74:37)
but he did it he just somehow figured (74:34 - 74:38)
out how to get through all of that and (74:37 - 74:40)
make it to a very high position at game (74:38 - 74:41)
freak (74:40 - 74:43)
um (74:41 - 74:45)
and he seemed very happy and i'm sure he (74:43 - 74:47)
was like i'm not sitting here trying to (74:45 - 74:48)
be like oh there was probably drama like (74:47 - 74:50)
it probably was fine he was probably (74:48 - 74:52)
just like you know i'm ready to move on (74:50 - 74:53)
um (74:52 - 74:55)
absolutely but also like the other (74:53 - 74:56)
things like i've (74:55 - 74:58)
other things that we don't know i got to (74:56 - 75:00)
the level that i can get to i fought (74:58 - 75:02)
through everything (75:00 - 75:04)
and i don't want to keep fighting like (75:02 - 75:06)
there's so many reasons why people are (75:04 - 75:08)
like i want to branch out on my own (75:06 - 75:12)
that i think (75:08 - 75:14)
one it's great that he got as far as he (75:12 - 75:15)
did because we've got a lot of great (75:14 - 75:17)
stuff out of it two i'm happy he's (75:15 - 75:18)
starting his own thing that he's gonna (75:17 - 75:21)
continue making the the products that he (75:18 - 75:23)
wants to make three it clearly seems (75:21 - 75:26)
like he left on good terms yeah and four (75:23 - 75:28)
he showed that other people can do it (75:26 - 75:31)
right like he is the trailblazer and his (75:28 - 75:34)
decisions after that i are i'm happy for (75:31 - 75:35)
whatever (75:34 - 75:37)
choices he makes (75:35 - 75:39)
um i don't i i think a lot of i feel (75:37 - 75:41)
like a lot of people are like this is a (75:39 - 75:43)
dire (75:41 - 75:44)
potent of what it's like to be (75:43 - 75:47)
non-japanese in the pokemon company i'm (75:44 - 75:49)
like i don't see that yeah i don't see (75:47 - 75:51)
that either who was like very successful (75:49 - 75:53)
and then said i want to be successful on (75:51 - 75:56)
my own terms i'm leaving on good terms (75:53 - 75:59)
i'm very happy and i can talk to people (75:56 - 76:00)
how i did it so they can do it too if (75:59 - 76:02)
they wish (76:00 - 76:03)
yeah i don't i don't i don't see this as (76:02 - 76:06)
like a neg i don't think like game freak (76:03 - 76:08)
or the pokemon company is taking a hit i (76:06 - 76:09)
just i just think there are there are (76:08 - 76:10)
definitely people out there that are (76:09 - 76:12)
special that you focus on and i think (76:10 - 76:14)
like for a lot of apple people johnny (76:12 - 76:16)
ives was that person before he left (76:14 - 76:18)
apple where it was like johnny i've (76:16 - 76:21)
changed apple for the better (76:18 - 76:23)
and i think james turner changed game (76:21 - 76:25)
freak for the better and (76:23 - 76:26)
i think you know (76:25 - 76:29)
if if we look at the if we if we look at (76:26 - 76:31)
the history of of game freak and pokemon (76:29 - 76:32)
you know masuda will always be talked (76:31 - 76:35)
about sugamari will always be talked (76:32 - 76:36)
about (76:35 - 76:37)
i think james turner will always be (76:36 - 76:38)
talked about (76:37 - 76:40)
um (76:38 - 76:43)
amore i feel like hasn't gotten there (76:40 - 76:45)
yet even though like amore is the one (76:43 - 76:46)
that has been directing all of these (76:45 - 76:47)
games (76:46 - 76:50)
uh and maybe because masuda is now is (76:47 - 76:52)
stepping out amore will be talked about (76:50 - 76:54)
more but i i think amore is equally (76:52 - 76:56)
talented like i i do think sword and (76:54 - 76:59)
shield are incredible um (76:56 - 77:02)
and i hope scarlett and violet is better (76:59 - 77:04)
uh but we'll have to wait and see on (77:02 - 77:06)
that i mean like again amore did other (77:04 - 77:08)
games too and they were they were they (77:06 - 77:10)
were just as good (77:08 - 77:13)
uh the the only maybe (77:10 - 77:16)
saving not say the only maybe thing i (77:13 - 77:17)
look forward to in the future in regards (77:16 - 77:20)
to james turner um (77:17 - 77:21)
is after his (77:20 - 77:24)
contracts or ndas or (77:21 - 77:26)
whatever are over (77:24 - 77:28)
is he going to talk about his pokemon (77:26 - 77:31)
process in like five years or six years (77:28 - 77:32)
is he going to be like (77:31 - 77:34)
i mean we can help so (77:32 - 77:37)
like you would hope that somebody at uh (77:34 - 77:40)
kotaku or the verge or whatever when (77:37 - 77:41)
they sit down and talk to him in a (77:40 - 77:43)
couple years about whatever other game (77:41 - 77:45)
he's working on you would hope that they (77:43 - 77:46)
would know that he has like a pokemon (77:45 - 77:48)
history and bring up like (77:46 - 77:52)
so tell me about how you design poiple (77:48 - 77:54)
you do a master class it depends on how (77:52 - 77:57)
like what the ndas are but yeah i mean (77:54 - 77:58)
after about five years the nda should be (77:57 - 78:00)
gone so we could talk about it hopefully (77:58 - 78:02)
if you want there's no way that there's (78:00 - 78:03)
an nda that's like for the rest of your (78:02 - 78:05)
life you can never talk about how you (78:03 - 78:07)
made this is a japanese contract (78:05 - 78:10)
american contract (78:07 - 78:10)
so i anyways if you haven't seen it the (78:12 - 78:16)
game is called the plucky squire um you (78:13 - 78:17)
should just be able to pop that into (78:16 - 78:19)
youtube or whatever and it's like a (78:17 - 78:20)
two-minute trailer i think it's worth (78:19 - 78:23)
checking out i it's it looks really (78:20 - 78:24)
exciting honestly (78:23 - 78:27)
i know summer games week was this past (78:24 - 78:30)
week and it was uh a lot of horror games (78:27 - 78:32)
and this was (78:30 - 78:33)
yeah it really was (78:32 - 78:36)
maybe the one game that actually looked (78:33 - 78:38)
good coming out of it it looks very cute (78:36 - 78:39)
very adorable (78:38 - 78:43)
um so yeah kind of crazy that uh in the (78:39 - 78:45)
last two weeks two (78:43 - 78:47)
big pokemon people kind of changed (78:45 - 78:48)
things around i i again i don't think (78:47 - 78:50)
that (78:48 - 78:51)
i don't think there's anything to worry (78:50 - 78:52)
about (78:51 - 78:55)
but i think if if you follow the pokemon (78:52 - 78:58)
company as closely as we do it is um (78:55 - 79:00)
it's interesting (78:58 - 79:01)
so (79:00 - 79:04)
anyways uh question of the week (79:01 - 79:05)
oh gosh we're there (79:04 - 79:08)
uh (79:05 - 79:08)
my brain has gone completely blank (79:13 - 79:17)
ah (79:16 - 79:23)
what is the question of the week (79:17 - 79:23)
okay i got some we got some youtube (79:23 - 79:27)
questions here we have a lot of youtube (79:25 - 79:28)
questions we had a lot of youtube (79:27 - 79:30)
questions and i didn't realize we were (79:28 - 79:32)
the james turner and the masuda thing (79:30 - 79:33)
was going to take so much time i didn't (79:32 - 79:34)
realize the pogo stuff was going to take (79:33 - 79:35)
so much time (79:34 - 79:36)
uh (79:35 - 79:39)
but (79:36 - 79:39)
um (79:41 - 79:44)
we did the time (79:43 - 79:45)
about (79:44 - 79:46)
the (79:45 - 79:48)
[Music] (79:46 - 79:50)
youtube the the (79:48 - 79:52)
israelites (79:50 - 79:55)
yes wireless raids (79:52 - 79:55)
uh all right here we go this is from (79:59 - 80:02)
tyler (80:01 - 80:05)
uh i think you guys should get somebody (80:02 - 80:07)
who can talk about the names in spanish (80:05 - 80:09)
and to some of the theories going with (80:07 - 80:12)
uh toro sada (80:09 - 80:15)
uh koraidon and miraidon also does the (80:12 - 80:18)
future alien guy from pokemon go fest (80:15 - 80:19)
have anything to do with the scarlet (80:18 - 80:22)
violet uh revelations also how's pride (80:19 - 80:24)
month going for everyone who are your (80:22 - 80:26)
top three pride pokemon um and that was (80:24 - 80:28)
from tyler (80:26 - 80:32)
i answered in line on that (80:28 - 80:34)
uh re from go fest i don't think has (80:32 - 80:37)
anything to do with scarlet and violet (80:34 - 80:40)
that is very alola stuff well the ultra (80:37 - 80:42)
recon squad that's from ultra (80:40 - 80:44)
ultrasound yeah yeah i guess maybe if (80:42 - 80:46)
you didn't play ultra's sun ultra moon (80:44 - 80:47)
because that was specific to ultrasound (80:46 - 80:49)
ultramoon where (80:47 - 80:51)
ultrasound ultramoon had four ultra (80:49 - 80:54)
recon squad people and they were two (80:51 - 80:56)
exclusive to (80:54 - 80:58)
two were exclusive to ultra sun two were (80:56 - 80:59)
exclusive to ultra moon they both have (80:58 - 81:02)
the same exact storyline which was they (80:59 - 81:04)
they both had poiple and they both end (81:02 - 81:06)
up catching a fur fruit and they're like (81:04 - 81:08)
obsessed with the fur fruit for a while (81:06 - 81:10)
which is like probably the highlight of (81:08 - 81:11)
that story (81:10 - 81:13)
and then they lead you to (81:11 - 81:15)
ultra necrozma (81:13 - 81:17)
um and that's kind of the gist of it (81:15 - 81:18)
yeah (81:17 - 81:20)
that's not a big storyline but i was (81:18 - 81:21)
wondering like people who never played (81:20 - 81:23)
that game like you're gonna (81:21 - 81:24)
have yeah i didn't even think about that (81:23 - 81:26)
until tyler asked the question of like (81:24 - 81:28)
what do you mean the ultra like the (81:26 - 81:30)
alternating clown squad is from yeah but (81:28 - 81:31)
if you never played ultrasonic you never (81:30 - 81:34)
saw it you never saw it i because i pop (81:31 - 81:35)
up i'm like huh (81:34 - 81:38)
interesting that they've chosen (81:35 - 81:39)
especially since there's a ton of (81:38 - 81:43)
pokemon go players who have never played (81:39 - 81:44)
the games (81:43 - 81:46)
right like this is probably their first (81:44 - 81:49)
time being introduced to wormholes ultra (81:46 - 81:52)
recon squad the whole shebang (81:49 - 81:53)
and (81:52 - 81:55)
i mean we kind of (81:53 - 81:57)
we covered the the two legendary names (81:55 - 81:59)
one means (81:57 - 82:00)
comes from the word for ancient one (81:59 - 82:03)
comes from the word for future (82:00 - 82:05)
and i don't know if it was in our (82:03 - 82:07)
youtube comments but i did see somewhere (82:05 - 82:10)
where somebody said that the the two (82:07 - 82:12)
we don't know if they're professors or (82:10 - 82:15)
not um the names one comes from pasada (82:12 - 82:17)
which means right past did we talk about (82:15 - 82:19)
this last week we did we did no no we (82:17 - 82:21)
didn't talk about the roots of their (82:19 - 82:23)
names (82:21 - 82:24)
briefly that they come from i think i (82:23 - 82:28)
swear greg mentioned it really quickly (82:24 - 82:30)
yeah well so yeah it's pasada and futuro (82:28 - 82:32)
which means past and future past and (82:30 - 82:33)
future (82:32 - 82:35)
yeah i mean that's like every youtuber's (82:33 - 82:36)
clickbait video that came out last week (82:35 - 82:38)
of like there you go i broke down these (82:36 - 82:40)
spanish names (82:38 - 82:42)
um (82:40 - 82:42)
yes so (82:44 - 82:47)
glad i'm glad we talked about re (82:45 - 82:49)
and i i didn't think about that until (82:47 - 82:50)
the question was asked of like oh yeah (82:49 - 82:52)
there was not people skipped ultrasound (82:50 - 82:54)
entrepreneurs they probably have no clue (82:52 - 82:56)
who they i will say the day that (82:54 - 82:58)
happened i'm like okay cool people are (82:56 - 83:00)
gonna have no clue who this is (82:58 - 83:02)
i like rea a lot i think i didn't i (83:00 - 83:03)
don't i don't know if we talked about (83:02 - 83:05)
this on the bonus podcast (83:03 - 83:08)
i'm just sad that professor willow died (83:05 - 83:09)
if you if you want to listen to the (83:08 - 83:11)
bonus podcast that is for patrons and (83:09 - 83:15)
for apple podcast subscribers but um (83:11 - 83:15)
i (83:15 - 83:17)
think the (83:16 - 83:19)
go fast even though day two was a (83:17 - 83:20)
disappointing (83:19 - 83:23)
day in my opinion uh i think that the (83:20 - 83:25)
ultra recon squad storyline was probably (83:23 - 83:28)
one of the best stories that pokemon go (83:25 - 83:29)
has told (83:28 - 83:31)
that's pretty funny um (83:29 - 83:33)
i think re is really great and i hope (83:31 - 83:35)
that once willow comes back reed doesn't (83:33 - 83:40)
he's not he's completely fantastic (83:35 - 83:42)
greg he's fine (83:40 - 83:44)
ah there's no proof of that you don't (83:42 - 83:45)
know (83:44 - 83:47)
correction of last week i said yu-gi-oh (83:45 - 83:50)
40 it's technically yu-gi-oh 5d where (83:47 - 83:52)
they ride on motorcycles (83:50 - 83:54)
shadow realm with you top three pride (83:52 - 83:58)
pro pokemon easy floor just (83:54 - 83:59)
zarina (83:58 - 84:00)
uh (83:59 - 84:02)
laurentis because of those that just (84:00 - 84:03)
rocking those (84:02 - 84:05)
disco pants (84:03 - 84:07)
uh (84:05 - 84:09)
my so i'm not gonna pick yours my top (84:07 - 84:10)
three are (84:09 - 84:13)
uh hatterine (84:10 - 84:15)
sylveon (84:13 - 84:17)
roserade uh why they're putting me on (84:15 - 84:20)
the spot all right number one is atkins (84:17 - 84:23)
no sure yes (84:20 - 84:25)
i (84:23 - 84:27)
it's not a dinosaur (84:25 - 84:28)
but (84:27 - 84:31)
did you not see the i saw it but again (84:28 - 84:33)
you didn't answer this question it's not (84:31 - 84:34)
a dinosaur (84:33 - 84:37)
[Laughter] (84:34 - 84:39)
definitely atkins though look the only (84:37 - 84:41)
the only pokemon that's officially come (84:39 - 84:43)
out is squirtle so (84:41 - 84:45)
true true (84:43 - 84:47)
canon (84:45 - 84:47)
i can't get over that picture if i can (84:50 - 84:54)
it's really great (84:54 - 84:59)
i'm just baiting you into me being able (84:56 - 85:02)
to give you that picture (84:59 - 85:04)
i i understand what it is to be a (85:02 - 85:05)
straight man i pretended to be one for (85:04 - 85:07)
20 years of my life (85:05 - 85:11)
uh on the professor thing what uh what (85:07 - 85:13)
if that's why their names aren't trees (85:11 - 85:15)
because they're not pokemon professors (85:13 - 85:16)
that would be neat i think we talked (85:15 - 85:18)
about this a little bit right yeah yeah (85:16 - 85:21)
um (85:18 - 85:21)
the the fact that it's possible that (85:22 - 85:26)
they are (85:24 - 85:29)
professors as teachers but not (85:26 - 85:31)
pokemon professors (85:29 - 85:34)
also did we mention that the like uh i (85:31 - 85:35)
can't remember the ladies name she has (85:34 - 85:38)
like fangs (85:35 - 85:40)
pasada zada (85:38 - 85:42)
yeah (85:40 - 85:44)
i feel like that's like an evil trope (85:42 - 85:47)
no you have things no that just means (85:44 - 85:48)
the (85:47 - 85:53)
wild like yeah oh okay okay (85:48 - 85:53)
that's then there's like no uh like (85:53 - 85:58)
buffy there buffy the vampire slayer i (85:56 - 85:59)
don't know why they're reminding me he's (85:58 - 86:00)
not a vampire (85:59 - 86:02)
i mean she could be but we don't know we (86:00 - 86:05)
don't know what's gonna happen watch any (86:02 - 86:07)
anime like just because you have fangs (86:05 - 86:10)
doesn't mean you're the bad guy (86:07 - 86:12)
people in anime have fangs for no (86:10 - 86:13)
apparent reason (86:12 - 86:16)
very true very it's like why does this (86:13 - 86:18)
person have fangs (86:16 - 86:20)
oh i i guess i don't watch enough anime (86:18 - 86:22)
actress themselves by having their (86:20 - 86:25)
canine sharpened (86:22 - 86:28)
uh this is from fan fans steve and will (86:25 - 86:30)
and greg too but i know uh you're more (86:28 - 86:31)
excited about this do you think marx (86:30 - 86:33)
will return what other ways do you think (86:31 - 86:38)
shinies can be special in this game (86:33 - 86:38)
oh that's all you buddy yeah i guess i (86:39 - 86:43)
guess for those that don't know in (86:41 - 86:44)
pokemon sword and shield they introduce (86:43 - 86:46)
something called marks (86:44 - 86:47)
there's a bunch of different kind of (86:46 - 86:50)
marks there's marks based on weather (86:47 - 86:52)
based on time there are per personality (86:50 - 86:54)
marks which are a little bit more rare (86:52 - 86:56)
but they're just random and then there's (86:54 - 86:57)
the rare mark which is (86:56 - 87:00)
the rarest mark um (86:57 - 87:02)
so ideally when you catch a pokemon in (87:00 - 87:03)
sword and shield there's a chance for a (87:02 - 87:06)
mark to appear in the sense of a rare (87:03 - 87:08)
mark that would be a 1 in 1 000 chance (87:06 - 87:10)
for it to be on a pokemon and then for a (87:08 - 87:13)
personality mark it would be a 1 in 100 (87:10 - 87:15)
chance for it to appear on a pokemon so (87:13 - 87:17)
ideally when you stack that with the (87:15 - 87:19)
fact that you could find shiny pokemon (87:17 - 87:21)
let's just say you don't have any charms (87:19 - 87:23)
you know to find a shiny pokemon is one (87:21 - 87:24)
in four thousand when you catch it then (87:23 - 87:26)
you could check to see if it has a mark (87:24 - 87:28)
and then there is a one in a hundred (87:26 - 87:29)
chance it could have a personality mark (87:28 - 87:31)
and a one in a thousand chance it could (87:29 - 87:34)
have a rare mark so realistically um (87:31 - 87:35)
a (87:34 - 87:38)
one in four thousand pokemon with a one (87:35 - 87:39)
in one hundred chance of having a (87:38 - 87:42)
personality mark would be more rare than (87:39 - 87:44)
a one in eight thousand pokemon that you (87:42 - 87:47)
would find in like ruby and sapphire (87:44 - 87:48)
um (87:47 - 87:50)
because of how those percentages have to (87:48 - 87:52)
times against each other and what your (87:50 - 87:55)
odds are for that so (87:52 - 87:57)
for the (87:55 - 88:02)
small but very vocal fan base of uh i (87:57 - 88:04)
hate that they made chinese too easy i (88:02 - 88:08)
liked a full odds hunt etc etc they they (88:04 - 88:12)
did make it where in the newer games yes (88:08 - 88:13)
you could method hunt yes you could get (88:12 - 88:16)
the shiny charm yes the odds are (88:13 - 88:17)
not as (88:16 - 88:20)
high as 1 in 8 000 but while adding (88:17 - 88:23)
marks to these pokemon (88:20 - 88:25)
you have now (88:23 - 88:27)
made (88:25 - 88:29)
a (88:27 - 88:31)
more rare i guess is probably the best (88:29 - 88:34)
way to put it more rare pokemon in a (88:31 - 88:37)
situation of you know a shiny (88:34 - 88:38)
coughing (88:37 - 88:40)
with a (88:38 - 88:43)
rare mark would be more rare than a one (88:40 - 88:45)
in eight thousand coughing from pokemon (88:43 - 88:46)
crystal (88:45 - 88:48)
ideally right uh and then the games (88:46 - 88:49)
obviously sword and shield introduced (88:48 - 88:51)
the sword shield has the shiny charm and (88:49 - 88:54)
then sword and shield the dlc has the (88:51 - 88:56)
mark charm which both of those add plus (88:54 - 88:58)
two to each roll so instead of one in a (88:56 - 89:00)
thousand for the rare mark it would be (88:58 - 89:02)
one in three hundred thirty three still (89:00 - 89:04)
incredibly rare i'm pretty sure (89:02 - 89:06)
i'm pretty sure a (89:04 - 89:08)
one in thirteen sixty five plus a one in (89:06 - 89:10)
three hundred thirty three is still more (89:08 - 89:13)
rare than a 1 in 8 000 i think (89:10 - 89:14)
drastically more rare i think if you do (89:13 - 89:17)
the math together anyways um i think (89:14 - 89:20)
marks are great i think marks are (89:17 - 89:22)
the thing that shiny hunters have always (89:20 - 89:24)
asked for but refuse to ignore (89:22 - 89:26)
which is like how can we make a more (89:24 - 89:27)
rare shiny they do make more rare (89:26 - 89:28)
shinies (89:27 - 89:31)
and they do they are fun to hunt like (89:28 - 89:32)
you could even if you didn't care about (89:31 - 89:34)
chinese you could get a (89:32 - 89:35)
um (89:34 - 89:36)
[Music] (89:35 - 89:37)
a (89:36 - 89:40)
personality mark for all your favorite (89:37 - 89:42)
dreadnoughs are all your favorite rose (89:40 - 89:44)
rays or all your favorite ronriguez's (89:42 - 89:46)
like you could (89:44 - 89:47)
mark hunt (89:46 - 89:49)
and just get different (89:47 - 89:52)
personalities for your pokemon so it (89:49 - 89:53)
adds more to the catching (89:52 - 89:55)
uh (89:53 - 89:55)
and then you know marx did not exist in (89:56 - 90:02)
legends but legends had alphas so that (89:59 - 90:05)
was like a more rare i'm doing air (90:02 - 90:07)
quotes shiny of like yeah i have a shiny (90:05 - 90:10)
badoo but i don't have an alpha shiny (90:07 - 90:12)
badoo so like that would be a more rare (90:10 - 90:13)
shiny (90:12 - 90:14)
um (90:13 - 90:16)
so yeah i i hope that that comes back in (90:14 - 90:18)
scarlet and violet i think marks are (90:16 - 90:20)
like an easy thing to return i think i (90:18 - 90:21)
think (90:20 - 90:24)
it only adds value to the game that (90:21 - 90:26)
isn't something like contests where you (90:24 - 90:27)
have to like build new contests i think (90:26 - 90:29)
it's pretty easy to move those going (90:27 - 90:31)
forward um (90:29 - 90:33)
i don't know i i'm not creative enough (90:31 - 90:37)
to know what else they could do to make (90:33 - 90:39)
i i guess the size thing like oh i want (90:37 - 90:40)
to catch a small one i want to catch a (90:39 - 90:42)
big one i want to catch a medium one i (90:40 - 90:44)
guess that's like okay uh they can be (90:42 - 90:46)
seen visually and (90:44 - 90:48)
the thing that i would want to come to (90:46 - 90:49)
pokemon games is what they did in (90:48 - 90:51)
magikarp jump i want a blue magikarp i (90:49 - 90:53)
want a gray magic i want a silver (90:51 - 90:55)
magikarp i want a pink magikarp but that (90:53 - 90:57)
would be (90:55 - 91:00)
i think that would be really cool (90:57 - 91:02)
and with the close of that five-minute (91:00 - 91:05)
monologue by steve i now put an official (91:02 - 91:08)
six-month moratorium on any questions (91:05 - 91:11)
about marks ribbons or curry that is you (91:08 - 91:14)
may not ask any questions about marks (91:11 - 91:17)
ribbons or curry on this program until (91:14 - 91:20)
december 11th (91:17 - 91:22)
also but you can talk about tapas (91:20 - 91:24)
because tapas will be the new curry in (91:22 - 91:26)
the new year (91:24 - 91:26)
although i hate tapas (91:27 - 91:29)
really (91:28 - 91:33)
uh i like the food i hate (91:29 - 91:34)
to hit we're getting it deep into the (91:33 - 91:36)
will anderson lore here (91:34 - 91:39)
don't ever go to a restaurant with me (91:36 - 91:42)
and ask to share my food the answer is (91:39 - 91:44)
no that's the intent (91:42 - 91:46)
is that the food be shared i'm not going (91:44 - 91:49)
to that restaurant (91:46 - 91:49)
uh final question here i know there's a (91:50 - 91:53)
lot of questions trying to get through (91:52 - 91:55)
this mittens asks for next week i would (91:53 - 91:57)
like to know which galler pokemon you (91:55 - 91:59)
three would like to be in scarlet and (91:57 - 92:01)
violet i'm specifically like (91:59 - 92:05)
the galler galler like both in bolton (92:01 - 92:05)
which color pokemon do i want to be (92:05 - 92:11)
uh snow (92:09 - 92:13)
my little snow me (92:11 - 92:14)
i mean i'm going to say cramer ant but (92:13 - 92:16)
if i can't say kramer ant i would like (92:14 - 92:17)
to see (92:16 - 92:19)
you guys say cramer ant it's a gather (92:17 - 92:22)
pokemon yeah (92:19 - 92:22)
stojoner yeah i was going to say so but (92:23 - 92:29)
we know stone journal's in there already (92:26 - 92:31)
so like i remember you said that like (92:29 - 92:32)
two weeks ago and i was like but we (92:31 - 92:35)
already know it's in the in the media (92:32 - 92:37)
yeah i would probably say ice cube ice (92:35 - 92:39)
cube would be great yeah ice cube (92:37 - 92:41)
but i still want bolton (92:39 - 92:43)
yeah i would i see how about yamper (92:41 - 92:45)
because its ability is so good (92:43 - 92:47)
it's really you would always want to (92:45 - 92:49)
shiny hunt with yamper just literally (92:47 - 92:51)
based on its ability (92:49 - 92:53)
although a new pokemon can get that (92:51 - 92:56)
ability that's true yeah if they who (92:53 - 92:58)
knows maybe le chunk has ballface oh it (92:56 - 93:01)
didn't say so on the maybe it's hidden (92:58 - 93:04)
ability no they've got to have a deep (93:01 - 93:08)
cut pokemon of belle and sebastian (93:04 - 93:08)
[Laughter] (93:09 - 93:16)
they've got to have a poochie that (93:14 - 93:19)
evolves into a bell (93:16 - 93:19)
uh pokemon of the week oh dang uh all (93:22 - 93:27)
right last week's pokemon (93:25 - 93:29)
blah blah blah (93:27 - 93:33)
has something to do with being between (93:29 - 93:36)
a super nintendo entertainment system (93:33 - 93:38)
and a gamecube but also (93:36 - 93:40)
uh after a year and a half of being (93:38 - 93:42)
eligible to be printed on a pokemon card (93:40 - 93:45)
it still hasn't been (93:42 - 93:45)
i have no idea i forgot to write down (93:47 - 93:51)
no (93:52 - 93:56)
it's alakazam (93:54 - 93:58)
you're close (93:56 - 94:02)
so kadabra is number 64 in the pokedex (93:58 - 94:06)
and cadabra got able after yuri geller (94:02 - 94:08)
finished his oh (94:06 - 94:10)
i forgot which one it was i forgot it (94:08 - 94:11)
was the cadaver (94:10 - 94:15)
you're close it's out it's kadabra (94:11 - 94:15)
but it was a trick because it kind of (94:17 - 94:20)
sounded like a sword and a shield (94:18 - 94:22)
pokemon that hadn't been printed on a (94:20 - 94:22)
card yet (94:22 - 94:24)
[Music] (94:22 - 94:26)
and the pokemon red and blue beta (94:24 - 94:29)
cadabra was known as pocus (94:26 - 94:29)
uh (94:30 - 94:34)
pocus al khazam (94:32 - 94:35)
yeah it's it's still bad [ __ ] it would (94:34 - 94:38)
have ever been hocus (94:35 - 94:40)
yes you know what you know what mr (94:38 - 94:42)
mime's japanese name is barrier (94:40 - 94:45)
and it's pretty good (94:42 - 94:48)
better than mr mime (94:45 - 94:48)
uh pocket monster's encyclopedia says (94:48 - 94:53)
that cadavers pokedex entry from pokemon (94:51 - 94:55)
red and green is a reference to an (94:53 - 94:58)
in-universe novel transformation (94:55 - 95:00)
that won (94:58 - 95:03)
the second pokemon literary literally (95:00 - 95:05)
award literary award (95:03 - 95:07)
what does that even mean what trivia is (95:05 - 95:08)
this (95:07 - 95:11)
pocket monster's encyclopedia i've never (95:08 - 95:12)
even heard of that (95:11 - 95:15)
1996 (95:12 - 95:15)
it was a field guide localization oh (95:15 - 95:20)
yeah whatever (95:18 - 95:21)
it was bad trivia (95:20 - 95:23)
uh we talked about cadabra not being (95:21 - 95:26)
printed since skyridge (95:23 - 95:27)
it's got a great (95:26 - 95:30)
uh shuffle icon and a good shiny from (95:27 - 95:31)
generation (95:30 - 95:33)
four and onward the everstone fails to (95:31 - 95:36)
prevent cab cadabra from evolving by (95:33 - 95:38)
trade (95:36 - 95:40)
not sure why that is (95:38 - 95:43)
uh in pokemon crystal a bug (95:40 - 95:46)
caused the capture formula for heavy (95:43 - 95:49)
ball to be incorrect (95:46 - 95:51)
uh (95:49 - 95:51)
and then that incorrect uh was (95:51 - 95:56)
because of the pokemon weight giving it (95:54 - 95:59)
a plus 40 catch rate modifier this also (95:56 - 96:03)
affects tauros and sunflora (95:59 - 96:03)
you you could we could do a whole (96:04 - 96:08)
episode about how nothing actually (96:06 - 96:10)
worked in pokemon gold silver and (96:08 - 96:11)
crystal (96:10 - 96:12)
everything in that game was except for (96:11 - 96:16)
the joy of playing the game (96:12 - 96:16)
uh (96:16 - 96:21)
bad shiny (96:18 - 96:21)
shuffle (96:22 - 96:25)
java's great okay i like the shiny too (96:25 - 96:32)
oh it's bad why is it bad (96:28 - 96:34)
it's just a bad yellow (96:32 - 96:37)
it's not it's not a green yeah (96:34 - 96:40)
i would rather it be green (96:37 - 96:40)
it looked like it was sick (96:40 - 96:44)
all right and too much this week's yeah (96:42 - 96:47)
that's why it's spoon melted (96:44 - 96:48)
speaks pokemon (96:47 - 96:50)
originally i was going to do a different (96:48 - 96:52)
pokemon but i had already done it within (96:50 - 96:55)
the past two years so i couldn't do that (96:52 - 96:56)
one (96:55 - 96:58)
so this fossil pokemon that recently (96:56 - 97:00)
became available is the only one of its (96:58 - 97:02)
type that a pokemon introduced in the (97:00 - 97:03)
same generation it would it was (97:02 - 97:06)
introduced in got an alternate form (97:03 - 97:08)
recently that had the same types but (97:06 - 97:10)
switched (97:08 - 97:12)
by recently became available i mean you (97:10 - 97:13)
can get one without having to evolve (97:12 - 97:16)
into it (97:13 - 97:16)
okay okay (97:17 - 97:21)
all right well thank you for listening (97:19 - 97:23)
thank you for making it to the end we (97:21 - 97:26)
will be back next week (97:23 - 97:28)
although i will be at the milwaukee (97:26 - 97:30)
regionals next week so i don't know (97:28 - 97:32)
we're recording this uh (97:30 - 97:35)
we'll figure that out (97:32 - 97:38)
let's just do it tomorrow (97:35 - 97:38)
we could probably maybe record on (97:38 - 97:41)
wednesday (97:40 - 97:43)
afternoon i think that's usually when we (97:41 - 97:46)
have recorded before trips (97:43 - 97:46)
um (97:46 - 97:48)
so yeah i'll be at the milwaukee (97:46 - 97:49)
regionals if you will be there and you (97:48 - 97:50)
want to say hi (97:49 - 97:53)
cool i will like to say hi to you i am (97:50 - 97:55)
no longer going to the north america (97:53 - 97:57)
international championships (97:55 - 98:00)
um but i will be at go fest in germany (97:57 - 98:01)
um (98:00 - 98:02)
so (98:01 - 98:04)
excited for that at least (98:02 - 98:06)
um (98:04 - 98:09)
speaking of traveling to uh (98:06 - 98:12)
milwaukee regionals the ideal here is (98:09 - 98:16)
the idea here is to uh stream the drive (98:12 - 98:18)
from minneapolis to milwaukee my friend (98:16 - 98:21)
steph is coming in um so we'll be doing (98:18 - 98:22)
like uh (98:21 - 98:24)
that (98:22 - 98:25)
she'll probably try to teach me spanish (98:24 - 98:28)
for five hours um but we're gonna we're (98:25 - 98:29)
gonna use the stream backpack we're (98:28 - 98:30)
gonna mount it in the car (98:29 - 98:32)
um i won't be looking at chat because (98:30 - 98:34)
i'll be driving and that's per twitch (98:32 - 98:36)
tos i'm not allowed to look at a phone (98:34 - 98:38)
when driving but steph will have chat so (98:36 - 98:40)
she'll be able to read it and respond (98:38 - 98:42)
and i'll be able to respond to what she (98:40 - 98:44)
reads out loud (98:42 - 98:46)
that is assuming that everything works (98:44 - 98:47)
and the reason i'm telling you this is (98:46 - 98:49)
because we're going to do a test stream (98:47 - 98:51)
on wednesday night where steph and i go (98:49 - 98:54)
to the new taco bell (98:51 - 98:56)
with that has the like drop down dude (98:54 - 98:58)
greg you know what i'm talking about the (98:56 - 99:00)
like taco bell that like drops down the (98:58 - 99:01)
food (99:00 - 99:03)
the first one ever (99:01 - 99:06)
is that here it's here it's it's it's in (99:03 - 99:07)
i don't remember what city it's in it's (99:06 - 99:10)
uh i'll find it don't you worry (99:07 - 99:12)
for those that don't know taco bell did (99:10 - 99:14)
a brand new store (99:12 - 99:17)
where the restaurant is on the second (99:14 - 99:19)
floor and then you go through there's (99:17 - 99:21)
four drive-throughs (99:19 - 99:24)
and then the food drops down (99:21 - 99:25)
but there's no like you can't go into (99:24 - 99:28)
the restaurant it's just they built the (99:25 - 99:29)
restaurant above the drive-through to (99:28 - 99:31)
drop the food down gotta have panic at (99:29 - 99:33)
the drive-through great (99:31 - 99:36)
and the the concept is that you're not (99:33 - 99:38)
in the drive-through for longer than two (99:36 - 99:40)
minutes (99:38 - 99:41)
which is probably impossible right now (99:40 - 99:44)
because everyone wants to go to (99:41 - 99:46)
see how it works (99:44 - 99:48)
it's just taco bell but we're going to (99:46 - 99:49)
do a test stream on wednesday night so (99:48 - 99:51)
if you want to if you want to join us on (99:49 - 99:53)
twitch for the taco bell stream (99:51 - 99:55)
that will be wednesday night to see if (99:53 - 99:57)
everything works in the car and then the (99:55 - 100:00)
drive stream will be on thursday (99:57 - 100:01)
and then i'll be streaming probably just (100:00 - 100:03)
pokemon go on sunday because i will lose (100:01 - 100:05)
the tournament on friday and then you (100:03 - 100:06)
know stream pokemon go for the weekend (100:05 - 100:09)
so that's the plan um thank you for (100:06 - 100:11)
listening thank you for making it to the (100:09 - 100:12)
end uh (100:11 - 100:14)
