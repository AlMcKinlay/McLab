[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 441st episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me whether they are 40 39 38 we don't know but we have greg here i mean what number are we looking for because i'm well over 40 in a lot of ways okay all right well you know last week was uh so if we if we look at the podcast as a movie you started out kind of optimistic at the beginning of the month and then we were in the the hero slump last week well here's the thing i had the game plan post thanksgiving after they ripped away cruelly my friendship bonus i had everything plotted out with exact with exact milestones of what needed to happen and then people and the game turned against me i cannot help that last week the game and people who i thought were friends turned against me in my quest to forty three people who were supposed to be giving me gifts to be best friends that could have been my best friends before to the end of the year vanished just ghosted me on the app i saw lord of the rings like 10 years ago it sounds like this [Laughter] and then niantic cruelly rips away my lucky egg xp that threw off my complete formula causing me to question my math i had to do a bunch of different things and i did not hit 40 on christmas day all right well we're gonna hold the suspense until the pokemon section also uh masterchef canada is terrible all right i need more episodes of australia and they just aren't there i know there's like 5 000 australian seasons which i'm not allowed to see i've been inducted into that cult australia i sort of get it i don't like use a lot of weird words but send more this way i don't want to torrent them all right i don't care that much as uh end of 2020 surprise we have a new guest on the show we got jake here hello i'm jake uh i don't know what else what do you need to know what do you what do you do who are you how did you how did you get to the show why why don't we know you why should we care about you that's true that's true some people might know you so a lot of people probably know me as atrocious gameplay over on twitch i helped steve make his youtube videos been listening to the podcast for three years now almost it was like right it was during your japan trip was that like three years ago almost the spring two years something like that going to be two years ago two years well i don't know time flies when you're having fun i guess it is 20 20. yeah gosh it's almost 20 21. please come closer uh but i'm a graduate school student i love pokemon uh i work full-time in college sports i do stuff for steve and a lot of other things steve real breaking nate a couple other people as well i do have a fundamental question that i've had ever since i became aware of atrocious i have a fundamental answer okay atrocious by definition is a very poor quality extremely bad or unpleasant do you have a dictionary in front of you right now none of your business got the old webster got webster's in my lives with me in my house of those qualities what would drive me to watch said gameplay or gaming i am very aware how bad i am at video games and so i make it i make it somewhat of a joke you know anything anything bad that happens you know i i lose a battle in pokemon or you know i lose a trading card game battle i'm just like i just toss it up to you know the old name and people are like part of the brand yeah it's it's it's part of the brand i'm well aware you know getting better every day because you can only go up from here is there some point when the atrocious will be removed or will this forever be a crutch that you fall back on so that if you have a bad show you'll say well it's in the name you can't blame me for being bad or will someday you leave the crutch behind this is the fundamental question if you want to get dental you are going to fundamentally have to improve and that means dropping atrocious see i thought about that too because uh it wasn't until probably june that i've that i started realizing like oh i could do like youtube editing and stuff because college sports is a nightmare that we don't have to talk about today but atrocious gameplay decent editing yes we're trying to rebrand to great at great editing from atrocious gameplay if you if you thought forward you would have already had like the twitter and the twitch handles of like mediocre gameplay getting better gameplay what's the five-year brand plan here see when i when i made the when i made the brand there was no five-year plan it was just all let's meme for the atrocious man he played games yeah apparently the approach is extends to other aspects we are only beginning to uncover this nugget i'm fantastic college budgeting but there you go that's pretty good why are you why are you not helping people with their college budgets that seems to be the real brand because i took discovery of mathematics in college that was my math requirement well jake's gonna join us today for the episode will is uh i don't know in east virginia or something right now south carolina oh yeah sure close enough geography yeah i i took uh atrocious geography in uh in college okay so yeah will's over there he'll probably be back next week i think i actually don't know when his flight back is but it'll be some time it'll it'll happen at some point if it doesn't get cancelled again due to blizzard we have uh some pokemon go news some pokemon masters news we have the space news which i get we never actually talked about this was announced a while ago but it's coming up so we gotta cover that because luckily enough i'll be taking some time off of twitch when this happens but i know if i was streaming i know exactly what questions i would be bombarded with all day on twitch so it's kind of a blessing that i'm i'm taking off but before we get to any of that there was a sword and shield promote the i guess this is the new segment there's a sword and shield promoted event by the time this podcast goes up it will be over because it's always thursday night to sunday night but it was for the promoted raids of chandelure which is not super christmasy i guess but hey um alolan vulpix deli bird frost moth what's the last one i made a graphic about this and i can't remember it it doesn't matter jinx yeah see it doesn't matter no one wanted jinx uh incorrect there are a number of people who are running jinx raids and you chided them and treated them with disdain true so they did two things they increased the odds for vulpix to be shiny which last month was squivet and the month before was gorge ice and the month before was the clefairy clefable and then delhi bird had pretty decent bonuses uh but the other three not so much but that was a cool event i guess people really like people like vulpix so i'm sure that was all right weird thing is it doesn't look like uh anyone at the pokemon company was working because they never went out up on the website i don't think they ever tweeted it maybe somebody at nintendo was working because it was in the switch news but no one actually checks the switch news i mean those things are prepped long before anybody went on vacation yeah that's probably that was just that was a scheduled tweet they did tweet it i think or did they not tweet it we talked about this before the show did they tweet them they did not twitter i didn't think i saw anything about it nope i didn't see it i think the japanese twitter tweeted it isn't there like some culture thing in japan where they're always working they're not taking any days off i mean that's me that's here as well always working there's another brand that you can get oh yeah greg did you get your shinies uh no okay no shiny vulpix for me i tried you were playing last night when i was on twitch playing last night i was playing friday when you were playing as well i think i did honestly i think it did five or maybe ten five star vulpix and that's a lot yeah it happened and then so i was like i this isn't like i can't masouda this and i can be suited and get in the ball that i want so why don't i just do that and i stopped yeah it seems like it was like the squivet thing where if you were the host and it was shiny it was guaranteed catch but if you were a guest and it was shiny it was not guaranteed it was not so it seemed it seemed like that uh i got a number of hidden ability ones which i was very excited about uh oh the snow warning yeah jake did you get to participate i haven't even loaded up the game in probably the last like week and a half i've been focusing on like emerald and pokemon black trying to get completed copies in those generations um so then i can transfer a spam of jirachi's and become the king of the jirachi economy you know you inspired me with the deoxys so i am i am the diaxis king that's true yeah it was a it was a cool event i liked i liked how so in past events with like squabbit and gorgeous you kind of just ignore everything else so if anyone just got pokemon sword and shield and doesn't know how these events work i'm only saying that because christmas just happened what you can do is you can just spam wishing pieces in dens until you got the five star vulpix and then you do the five star vulpix to see if it's shiny but then you kind of ignore the jinxes and the chandeleurs whatever the other uh the frost moth but in this case the deli bird had better rewards than the other ones i just mentioned so i would stop to do the deli birds uh they gave really good amount of large candy and extra large candy which i'm loving i found a gold five-star deli bird and it gave me multiples of every type of candy yes so the so promoted raids cannot be gold so that was a non-promoted race no it was rare i found the rare one so the non-promoted deli birds can give you dream balls and i also did a gold deli bird this weekend and i got one dream ball from it and it was very awesome and that's always running and i've made graphics about that on instagram and twitter of there's a way to get every type of pokeball in the game so like beast ball you can get from dynomax adventure and then the other apricorn balls safari ball sports ball love ball lure ball you can get from the scam-o-matic and then the only one that was missing from the equation was the dream ball but anytime you do a deliberate raid in sword and shield as long as well the promoted raids don't count because promoted raids have set drops but delhi bird is always spawning in raid dens but they have a um anywhere between a one to three percent chance of dropping a dream ball so if that's your favorite pokeball get on that daily bird hunt 24 7. anyways that event is over now let's talk about some events that are coming up which are the pokemon go events countdown to pokemon go kanto tour celebrating with the unova region i'm i think they're going backwards i don't understand i guess because we just had calos like i mean kalos just launched like two weeks ago three weeks ago i don't know if they're starting with unova i would assume that it would be like sinnoh next then hohen then johto then here we're at kanto i guess otherwise maybe i don't know i mean going backwards isn't bad is it a countdown thing are we supposed to be like countdown it does say countdown to pokemon go tour celebrate unova with us so uh this is from january 5th through january 10th snivy tepig oshawa lilly pup hertier blitzel ragnaro drilber scraggy time pull venipeet rubbish gothita solosis and fera seed will be appearing more frequently in the wild if you're lucky trainers you may encounter a shiny snivy i like that a lot are they giving up on community day if this is them saying there will not be a snivy committee today i'm angry i don't want to say like oh niantic figured out that starters are more valuable as community day things because they did charmander twice and also they probably would have figured that out i don't know like three years ago i this is like a weird choice yeah it's still better than soft resetting okay that's true so i'm happy that's not that's not even a comparison it's a love but it's like hi this i placed this bar in a grave six feet under it's better than that okay they i mean they could still just do communities right yeah they better we know machop community day is coming up obviously machap has been shiny before there there has been pokemon that have already like guess the guess is a good example um the following pokemon will hatch from 5k eggs rock and roller saladal petal imoga karablast joltik lgm and shellmet enjoy event exclusive field research that will have uh stardust lead to encounters with snivy ted pig oshawatt ferracid following pokemon will appear in raids snivy tepe goshawa timber dwell and clink hertier tranquil excadrill amungus will appear in three star raids like always three star raids are completely useless and a waste of your dollar this is also a really weird decision i guess i don't know what they're doing genesect holding a burn drive will appear in five star raids this is the first time the this form of genocide will appear in pokemon go be sure to have a chance to catch it note the shiny form of genesect will not be available during this event ripoff so there's no reason to do it use your free raid pass to get the decks entry and then never do another one again i guess the only reason to do it is if genesect is good for gbl but i i think people have already determined that it's not i mean you have a bug what is genesex typing just bug right i thought it was bug steel but if it has a fire if it has the fire drive does that it doesn't change its type i don't know how genocide works i'm not a genesect master i'm only a deoxys master uh it is bug steel with the ability download yeah it's the same as porgio uh when it's holding the burn drive its light turns red and its move techno blast is a fire type okay so still useless yeah yeah mega charizard mega blastoise mega obama snow will be pairing in mega raids mega charizard y will become more powerful from january 5th through january 12th i guess that's whatever that's fine i does more damage against genesect stay tuned for collection challenges in the today view uh more details for that in early january and then up next oh it does say here i should read i should really read these tweets i do read them initially uh i do read them twice i read them i the second time i read them is when they send it two weeks after the event ended in the app the second time i read it the sinnoh event will be next from january 12th through january 17th stay tuned for more details greg how do we feel about going to texas for the kanto event i am not going to texas for the kanto event it's warm we can be outside i am not spit okay i am not spending like a hundred dollars to stay plus like what 300 round trip to fly to texas for pokemon go a business expense who's business i mean if you if you read to the end of the lawsuit the lawsuit is about the fact that you don't pay us all right here's the deal what if we drop the lawsuit and i call mr pokemon aka my capital one credit card and mr capital one pikachu helps helps us get down to texas look i like playing pokemon go outside real bad i really do i like walking around greg yeah we can walk around inside an entire enclosed city called minneapolis all right that's not bad with hundreds of stops and your number one requirement bathrooms i thought i do like bathrooms like like weigh this easy access to clean bathrooms or being outside steve because i know what the choice was at go fest that's true that's true you have to worry about the sun the bugs the grackles it's very that's very true the texans uh are these are these like warm tunnels we're walking through yeah okay i mean warmth varies by how much each building is willing to put into them like some some are just like we're gonna do the bare minimum so you get a little chilly section but then i mean there's still buildings that people use yeah because i don't wanna walk around with like uh you know a puffy huge coat i just want my hoodie yeah i mean people people wear their business clothes and walk through the through the skyways all day long all right other pokemon go news here is uh the january research breakthrough will be chansey uh the featured pokemon for five star raids will be ho oh it's funny as i was like a week ago uh i was talking to joe from cereby we were talking for like two hours um we were just catching up on things and talking to each other and complaining about things and not it was a very nice conversation but we i can't remember what it what we ended up talking about but joe was like i wonder what they're going to do at the end of the year and i said well there's always time for ho-oh lookie so a-ho-oh will be appearing from january 1st to january 5th uh genocide holding the burn drive we talked about that that will be january 5th through january 12th heatran will return from january 19th or sorry january 12th to january 19th heatran can be shiny ho-oh can be shiny kyogre and groudon will be appearing in january 19th through january 26th if you're lucky you may encounter shiny kyogre shiny crowd on now i'm pretty sure they haven't give kyogre crowd on their good moves yet nope so that made them primal either that's the real good one yeah and then a surprise raid will be appearing between tuesday january 26 local time i'm gonna guess lugia it's it's totally lugia surprise okay is what it's lugia or it's mewtwo oh yeah it could no no they'll probably save me two for the kanto event maybe it'll be sunglasses mewtwo sunglasses meet you in a uh one-piece hat and then uh mega charizard uh why blastoise obama snow appearing in raids and then on tuesday january 19th mega venusaur will return mega hound doom roll return mega houndoom will be more popular and a new pokemon mega pokemon will make its debut on january 19th so that's exciting i still like mega raids i think they're fun they're better than any three-star raid ever that existed and then spotlight hours for the month uh january 5th is going to be lillypup with double the stardust january 12th will be drift driftloon with double vxp january 19th will be shroomish with double the candy and then january 26 will be fanfee with double the transfer candy and in a few days slowpoke will have 20 20 glasses and it will run from december 31st to january 4th and it does say in this blog post not the other blog post that different weeks will you know we'll highlight unova senoho and johto and collection challenges are coming soon which is whether you're new to pokemon go or a season trainer collection challenges provide a handy guide to catching pokemon during certain events look out for the launch of collection challenges in early january 2021 so that seems like a new feature coming for the game which is cool i guess i mean you love collecting i do like collecting now greg the moment of truth you have five days left to get to 40. yep did you do it where are we i hit level 40 on december 26th the boxing day 40. this is ours golf clapping you how does it feel does it you got to the real everyone to play this game again here's here's the one thing so we didn't have snow until christmas for the month of december on my lunch break i was driving around my neighborhood and hitting 20 to 40 stops to get gifts to come back home and then after work send an open gifts for 26 days plus catching things here in that it was in a word a nightmare did you master the excellent throw no well here's the thing there are so many things about this game that makes me so mad one of them is hitting three excellent throws in a row and it never staying in the ball and then missing the excellent circle by like a millimeter and that's the one that catches yeah that is infuriating and the amount of times of me sitting in my car as people drive by as i'm screaming at myself also brad's like can you start taking your car because i don't want people in the neighborhood to be putting on the neighborhood app why is this silver car driving around and stopping randomly throughout the day put every day at one uh were you were you grinding out lucky eggs as well or no yeah so this is part of why i was so mad at my experience denial is because i had a lot of myself i made my thing was i was not going to spend any money but i would buy one large pack of lucky eggs and if it happened in those eggs and it could according to my calculations then that was the amount of money i was willing to spend period if it couldn't be done without purchasing lucky eggs then i wasn't gonna do it so when that one failed i was angry so i did what every angry person does i complain to support and they're like well you actually got it we think but anyways here's a new lucky egg i got an extension on my lucky egg but yeah so i only lucky egged and timed out and this is the part that drove me the most up the wall was trying to time out and talk to people i didn't know and didn't know their names of when i was gonna hit ultra friends so i had to like stop sending them gifts and just say you had you just send me gifts over the next three days so i can time the lucky egg so the time that it failed with cody i had four people lined up and it failed for all four and that would that was where i was at last week when i'm like i am so angry at this game the messages are terrible it's like i was doing regis yesterday and bobby sent me the invite to the raid i clicked on the right section hit the orange box did the raid five minutes later i get a message bobby has invited you to a raid again no it's the one from five minutes ago yeah to be fair they had to roll that out very quickly this year [Music] uh i mean we've had it for so long though minus the fact they make like five million dollars a month seven months of this feature and that's not the only thing that comes in million minutes after it actually happened still faster than ptcgo but i will say the one good thing i i did realize during my trip around the neighborhood every lunch hour is there's not not a lot of people taking over gyms so i was getting my 50 coin bonus constantly i just go to a far out gym and plop a pokemon in it and then be like see you tomorrow yeah yeah i've noticed that the last like week where like gyms are not being taken down it's probably like a north a north united states thing because everyone doesn't want to leave their house yeah because it's too cold it's really cold and there's not a lot of i mean it's just not a lot of players up in my neighborhood anyways things don't turn over that much although i'm going to call scrooge on all the people who took down my holiday pokemon that i left throughout the city on the 24th bringing holiday cheer and all y'all just murdered them and sent them back you're all scrooges uh but i did hit 40 and i did all the things to get the stupid really ugly hat man i'm i'm very happy that i am ever so casual pokemon go player i just kind of load up the game every so often check check to see if i have any shinies find the winner shiny hat pikachu say oh look at that and then i catch it and then move on that used to be my life until this show how do you feel about texas [Music] [Laughter] indoor plumbing but now i'm now i'm free of my curse okay i have met the requirements did it feel good though did it feel good hitting 40. you got the badge you got the gyarados hat no champagne the the the good sensation was oh i don't have to care about this anymore that the release of having to do this was greater than seeing the 40. because that the 40 just meant oh you're done so like every mmo ever yep oh cool i finally beat that raid boss i'll never do this again i mean i do multiple raid bosses because they're fun but um seeing the 40 which of course happened 10 minutes after i hit it i finally got the screen and i wasn't prepared for it which is why the screenshot i took of it is so bad yeah i'm just relieved that it's done the like the thing is is that i had it plotted out very carefully i knew i would get it by the end of the year if everybody played nice the cody mishap really threw a wrench in that plan and i was not a hundred percent sure i was going to have enough people left well you can't trust cody you hit it it's not cody's fault it's an antics book you can't trust me but they gave me a lucky egg uh so now i'm back to lackadaisically giving up uh gifts because i am not i i am not driving in the snow to 20 stops over the next week while i'm on vacation it is just not gonna happen well the saga is over the saga is over all right uh to everybody who congratulated me thank you to everybody who has been saying the real game starts at 40. again you're all liars that's the biggest level well it was 40 greg now it's 50. the real game begins at 50. you're not at 50 yet so how can you even make that statement oh you can't you don't even know you don't even know what's happening at 50. my uncle is pikachu and i just know all right we're gonna take a break my aunt is pikachu and tells me that's a lie we're gonna take a break we got some uh pogba masters news and then we have this space station news that we have to talk about so we will be right back [Music] dna kind of danced around the bush beat around the bush [Music] dance around the bush [Music] and we are back all right let's let's talk about the space thing you sound so excited uh let's talk about the space thing if you if you click on any of these tweets and you read the comments oh boy okay so the japanese okay let's pause pause why are you reading the comments it is almost 20 21 nothing good comes in the comments nothing look i could be wrong but you are the oh yeah most of the time could be wrong but on on 10 p.m exactly december 25th christmas day the pokemon company japan pokemon underscore cojp verified twitter tweeted that the 2021 space sunrise live is happening on the 31st now they've announced this before in the past uh they link to twitter can have events now so you can like yeah i don't it links to the like the twitter event where you can set a reminder which is kind of cool then the official pokemon the english twitter retweeted it and said like tune in to check this out and if you read the comments or exist on the internet for more than 2.5 seconds you'll see a bunch of people being like diamond pro remakes [Laughter] well and the thought process behind that is because it's the s their thought process let me try to explain their thought process their first thought process is well it's space so that's palkia yep which is like okay i guess i mean there are better pokemon that represent space but that's like yes uh uh palkia does control space and then there this is the stretch they go well it's the sunrise and that's like a time of day so deal and you're like yeah you're you're really stretching there but okay it's like the plushies for that was in the uh nintendo or the pokemon directs and they were like let's go merrell oh right because they had like espionage the understanding is like pokemon the pokemon company isn't going to space so we need to unwrap what's happening here because i i think that's that's the problem the space sunrise live 2021 is being put on not by the pokemon company but by like i think i think the it's called kybo and they're sending it's it's being put on by the international space station so i'm gonna i'm going to go to the there's an actual website kaibo dot space k i b o dot space it's in japanese you can use google chrome to translate it i'm just gonna read it here in 2020 the daily lives of uh people around the world have changed significantly at the end of this year in the beginning of the new year i would like to deliver a message of kybo from the space to earth the upcoming kaibo space broadcasting station will challenge the first sunrise of the universe let's celebrate the first sunrise of the universe together on earth regardless of age gender occupation nationality race culture so that the new year of so that this the new year will be the year of kybo this time as well we will send from the program studio installed from the kaibo japanese experiment module of the international space station which orbits 400 km above ground that's not in freedom miles i don't know what that is uh kilometers kilometers details of the program will be announced on twitter and youtube as soon as they're added and then it shows who's part of the crew so there is uh it's a bunch of like japanese astronauts and then the most important part here like how does this involve pokemon is because there are sponsors for this event so the pokemon company is a sponsor of the event they paid money to put their name on something this is not new sports teams do this uh the olympics the well olympics is also sports i don't have to sit here and explain sponsoring but the pokemon company sponsored the spaceship thing coca-cola japan also sponsored the spaceship thing and twitter sponsored the spaceship thing even though the pokemon company japan and the pokemon company twitter are tweeting about this of course they would they paid a lot of money to be a sponsor but the the reach of like well it's existing in space means diamond and pro remakes is not is it's it's such a shallow view of like desperation of like i'm sure one day we will get diamond and pro remix i am sure that the pokemon company isn't paying the international space station and a japanese astronaut to watch a sunrise to then after the sunrise is over turn to the camera and say hey we're making diamond and pearl remakes i don't think that's happening i think what that is really going to happen is like a pikachu plush is going to float in space and or a bottle of coca-cola is going to float next to it i have just a translation i wanna know what what it's really supposed to say when it says the first sunrise of the universe because that doesn't sound like the right translation yeah well you know google chrome so the first sunrise of the decade the first sunrise of the earth the earth that like it's not definitely not the first sunrise of the earth we've had a lot of them and you could also say like well why did they sponsor the space station if it's not for some big announcement not everything has to be a big announcement i mean the pokemon company has or is recently partnering with gucci and the north face for clothing lines they partnered with long champ this past year they've partnered with bear walker they've partnered with a lot of brands especially in like the last five years it's to announce that the special raids at the end of january will be access yes and we talked yeah we talked about this we talked about this before the show started but i feel like hoenn is a better representation of space than diamond and it is it absolutely is they have a space station they have deoxys they have rayquaza raymond quasar the astronaut literally in the delta episode of omega ruby alpha sapphire you go into space and you do not meet palkia or dialga there you meet dioxxus who's like i'm going to come in infect your entire planet with my dna yeah and there's a lot of space pokemon there's clefairy there's star u there's deoxys there's does that mean that they're ultra beasts there's many air no ultra beasts they're frozen although ultra dimension why the door is marked do not open for a reason if they announce a game which i guess anything is possible that would be a very weird way to announce it it's finally announcing pokemon sleep because you wake up at sunrise oh please come on i need that so bad i've been waiting so long i feel like if any time they were to announce a game it would probably be on the 25th anniversary which they are not shy about reminding us of over and over that's like a year away though yeah uh but if you don't think in years if you expand your mind and you think in days it's only like 60 days away that doesn't sound right but if you want a treat boy read the comments it is it is nothing but pictures of dialga and pictures of uh [Laughter] there's gonna be a lot of disappointed people let people dream steve if you look at the events tab and you look at the tweets of people talking about like the event itself with the hashtag there's one person that talks about how like maybe you get to change your form of deoxys i think that would be kind of cool like through pokemon go or home or something like that i think that'd be kind of nice because how do you how do you change your form of deoxys once it's in like you can't do it once you've put it in like home right no you can change it once you get well the access ain't moving out of home many times yeah once well you can't change any forms in home so it's like the same with like cast form cast form defaults um cherum i think defaults de-access defaults genocide defaults sub-ally defaults once you move out of home you can change the form niantic solution is just pay a different just pay a dollar for a different form yeah they're the real there yeah well i mean the real winner is those of us who don't buy into that i think i'm going to watch the sunrise what else am i going to do it starts i think it's better than watching the ball drop yeah i think watching it's it it looks like it's streaming exclusively on youtube and exclusively on twitter which sunrise like what time it's like it says uh 2345 start time but i don't know is that like utc or i don't know if that's utc or not because it doesn't say utc after it so i'm not sure if that's japanese time [Laughter] yeah i don't know i must say yeah i'm assuming there'll be like a pikachu and like a star you plush floating around or something i mean if i'm up okay i did find it it's 11 45 p.m tokyo time okay sure december 31st tokyo time will be the sunrise sunrise is at midnight i don't okay whatever no i'm very confused well they're in space so they can see the sunrise at a different i don't know i don't know how space works that's why i'm watching the broadcast i mean so that means it's 8 45 p.m tokyo time no it's 11 45 p.m tokyo time on the 31st which means for us it would start at 8 45 p.m no it's until 8 00 a.m oh a.m oh yeah 8 45 a.m on on the third 31st 30 31st 30th no they're not that far ahead in time it would be it would be it would be 8 a.m the 31st for central time oh okay yeah because they're like 12 hours they're like 13 hours ahead i think time zones are hard this is off uh standard dot co dot uk gaming game director nagashima on why the pokemon trading card game is so popular because people love cards next this interview kind of got missed by a lot of outlets uh this interview was like shortly after darkness ablaze came out but i just wanted to pull it here uh tcg has sold over 13 30 billion cards in 13 languages nagashima was the one that initially helped create the card game based off the video game obviously the video game came first one of the questions was tell us about the sword and shield expanse expansion nagashima said sword and shield darkness ablaze the third expansion in the series was released this summer summer in japan technically um in addition to eternity's v-max one of the legendary pokemon from sword and shield darkness of blaze will also have charizard v-max fan favorite charizard makes its gigantomax debut in terms of the cards to look out for there are a lot of cards that we look forward to how players will use such as crowbat v and vika volt v i don't jake i don't think anyone's playing vika volt v um it was before rotation when like lost thunder was still around because you had electro power and um thunder mountain but now i mean you could play it in like you could play it like a peak around build or with mewtwo like a mewtwo box type thing but not not as much anymore no it's it's done now for the most part generally i'm involved in the overall direction of the game mechanics such as game environments design and game logic but i'm also somewhat involved in the art direction evening standards ask how have the mechanics of the game change over the years and stay relevant in an increasing digital world and nagashima says one of the key things that we feel has led to the popularity longevity of the pokemon trading card game is the face-to-face aspect of play paired with brands core values of friendship togetherness and friendly competition that's such a generic answer we like when people play each other across the table there have of course been many mechanics added to the tcg over the years which has helped the game feel fresh and different for players the strength of the game though is through face-to-face social connections it creates i often visit tournaments and leagues to see the people who have been playing the game since they were kids and now with their own kids i've known these players for many years the community has continued to grow in my opinion you don't get the same feeling with a digital only product and that's what makes the pokemon tcg so special and mean so much to our current players our current focus remains on creating the best physical products we can for our players but of course we always are exploring new ideas not specifically as a way to counter the impact of the digital environment but to remain relevant to a current fan based appeal to new fans across the globe i mean the the tcg is like at the height of popularity and there has been zero face-to-face encounters in the last year they've been doing tournaments in japan yeah they have the weird class thing yeah which i've gone pretty well from like the matches that i've been able to watch like streamed on youtube and stuff but yeah in the in the states and everywhere else it's local store owners holding events that are not official pokemon events it's just that like that whole comment worries me that like we know that the pokemon trading card game online is a primary primarily a us product there's no way for like a japanese fan to play it and it worries me that nagashima and staff goes like ah we think digital is is bad and may hurt card sales or just not a needed thing where in reality like magic is doing both very well like the magic digital card game is not hurting their physical card game right and so him saying that is seems like he's maybe maybe i'm reading too much into it but it seems like he's like we don't need digital to succeed yeah you're probably right but also digital is nice it's the only official way to play right now yeah literally it's great when the best cards in the game right now actually don't work the way that they're supposed to that's the best part that whole answer kind of worries me that they just don't have any plans for ptcgo um why do you think the card why do you think the game has remained so popular nagashima says we are fortunate that the pokemon brand as a whole continues to flourish and every year we see new fans beginning their pokemon journey throughout the video game animated series apps like pokemon go or indeed the tcg the video game does a great job at introducing new mechanics to pokemon each release which is a big part of their popularity which is true that's why there's always some sort of gimmick mega evolution z moves dynamics you have to have some gimmick to attract people the pokemon tcg meanwhile is based off a core charm of the franchise collecting trading battling pokemon you can enjoy the fun of pokemon in a physical way we are also very welcoming of a community that who wants to actively play the game starting at grass roots levels with leagues and tournaments at toy and hobby stores all the way to our world championships we have seen so many long lasting friendships formed over the year uh and that's kind of it there's more questions in the interview but it's it's like i always i appreciate that they get to interview big names like nagashima but i feel like they really just ask very generic questions and they get generic answers yeah i i read this a couple weeks ago when it came out and i was just like it was just another like set of words i i would just wish they would go more in depth of like why do you make charizard cards bad so bad why did you create adp that's the real question that i want to know and why do you keep making cards that make zashian better why are crowback cards always good who there loves crobat like there's nothing even saying like how do you think the pokemon trading card game has held up during this pandemic like that would probably be a pretty i don't know i feel like that's a pretty decent question like you you have a very physical product in a world where it's very hard to have physical interactions right now yeah and like your question though you're only like online events or like your only events right now are like the players cup and the team challenge so like why that's like literally free promotion right there i mean the interview came out december 4th from jack jack kesser um but darkness ablaze came out in the summer for japan and then it came out september for the united states so yeah like september august so yeah he he obviously interviewed him and then took time to like finalize the article and put out the article and stuff but i mean covet was kovit's been a thing all year so i'm not sure it's just it's a kind of a weak interview cool that he got to interview nagashima though speaking of competitions players cup 3 for the video game has official rule sets it is series 7. the competition will start on thursday january 14th through january 17th so in about two to three weeks from this podcast episode trainers who participate will receive 50 battle points top 256 people from the north america will go on you can sign up starting now through january 14th remember you if you forget to sign up you don't get to participate master division stuff any bald guy shirt available no no i'm out no ball guy only only the chance to make it to players cup three so and the final bit of news is pokemon masters n has arrived to pokemon masters with zechariah i think we were i i was confident it was going to be resharam but lo and behold it was not resharing although i'm pretty sure i believe i said it was i'm pretty sure even though russian ram is kind of the main focus in like the games uh with with n because i think i think that's like the story default i think in the manga zekrom is this the story default for n they could also release another n yeah with pressure suit i don't know who they give rush ramp to though if they don't give it to end as well i still think colerus gets kiram i mean colerisk is kiram they may have an event for um preshram for you to bound with it like they do with the other ones so you know it could be a legendary event where at the end you pair with the legendary full disclosure i am partnered with dna there is a new year's gift if you sign into the game between now and december 31st skyla and erica will present you with 3 000 gems which is a 11 poll and there's a new year's rally countdown which will get you gems every day you log in if you do eight days in a row you get one two three four five six seven twelve hundred gems i think i wanna say there's the new year's bingo too i wanna say this games should never listen to fans i took that survey and i said i want more holiday sink pairs and then in their last producer note they were like we're going to give you more holiday sink pairs because we're listening to you guys and now i feel like there are too many holiday sling pairs because i didn't i haven't pulled there you brought this upon us i haven't pulled erica yet we know there are two sink pairs coming for new years and just got released i did this to myself i don't know what to pull on now this is the banner problem this is what everyone's been telling you about is the banner but i like holiday sync pairs they're so cool yeah but i like all be on the same banner i like and no they shouldn't be on the same banner that was the problem with uh i i thought so at first that they should be on the same banner but they shouldn't because i who do they put on the same banner they put they put old rose old holiday rosa and old holiday cybold on a banner and i pulled on that banner i think i spent like 12 000 gems which is 411 pulls and i ended up getting two cybolds and no rosa if i would have pulled one cybold i would have then switched the rosa banner because if they put if they put skyla and erica on the same banner and then you pull skyla then you still have to pull on that same banner for erica and then what if you get into skyla then you have a powered up skylab yeah it's not worth it i don't care about the flowers where's it in there look i'm a collector i want one of each i don't care about how good they are i mean that's how they make money off of you i think the problem here is just christmas and new year's are so close together so you get stuck with two holiday pairs and then what's our next holiday like valentine's day so that's like two months away it's like a month and a half yeah it's the 14th of february and then what's after what's after feb well like st patrick's day banners easter banner martin luther king's days banner uh president's day banner i can't wait for president day and my birthday banner did you paul did you guys get the end did you pull on the skyla what do we do i pulled on all of them and for the last three months every poll that i've done has been all three stars so i don't see the point in pulling anymore i did one pull for n on his banner and it was not a bleep bleep and i got three five stars one of them being n all right so the luck balances out i see here that is really good ends really i think n is the best like electric type thing pair the only problem that i have with it is outrage it just immediately confuses them and then it's a pain but if you pair with torterra torterra has that one ability with dawn where it gets rid of all status conditions so i've been liking that for when times get tough and i need to make sure that i don't get hit by confusion yeah i only have like 9000 gems i don't know what to pull on oh i only have 9 000 gems i have 1 000 and i have pulled garbage for three months can't complain about my polls can't complain about that but i i can't i will get more gems tomorrow because i get the 1500 bonus at the end of one of the everyday things because i make sure to log in every single day they did fix this well fix is debatable depending on who you ask but stamina is now replenishing every four minutes instead of every six minutes i'm not sure what the vibe on that is i haven't really played a lot in the last couple days because of the holidays but i really just play when my eggs are hatching like every 12 hours and oh i've given up on eggs that's a that's that's a bad that's a bad addition i just keep loading them in i don't really do anything else with them exactly you load them in you say not shiny don't care and then leave the daycare they did increase the daycare from 100 eggs to 200 eggs i got a free uh i got a free incubator i got a free incubator that's nice but like what it is is i just like if it doesn't have the three slashes i just tran or donate it yeah i'm gonna put in the next set of eggs yeah like the egg process feels so cheap they are just things that hatch not shiny not three dump it in the grinder move on it's such a weird pointless part of the game and none of those pairs are particularly good anyways they don't have any meeting they don't have like a story meaning you don't really bond with them they just appear not shiny don't care move on it's like the weirdest just thing that was tacked onto the game that literally nobody asked for i have shiny pairs and i don't know how to make them like real i don't know how to make them like playable pairs they just sit like maxed out with the affinities and i don't know how to like make them be playable in the game i just want to flex my triple well i can't because they're all my character but i want to be able to use my shiny pincer there was nobody because there's nobody that went out that asked about eggs that people were like yeah eggs are cool what did you just say about listening to fans i i i am the first to admit i must say so that applies to eggs as well like i think i think originally when eggs came out it was an interesting idea because people thought that they would be much more exciting and game changing than they are and instead their three star in a world that's now six star ex yeah that don't do anything special take a long time to power up to even get into playable battles and even if you power them up there's no combination that is ever above like third tier use it if you have nothing else yeah i mean i like does that dopamine hit of like i got a shiny like that's exciting and that's always fun and they're not like terribly hard to get it's not they're not invasive in a way where like you feel like you have to go out of your way to get them like they give you eggs pretty well and then if they end up being shiny it is fun but the problem the problem is like they can it's an easy fix they can make egg pokemon decent they just have to push an update being like okay well if you invest this much into the egg pokemon it will be on par with like it doesn't have to be on par with like a six star it doesn't have to be an it doesn't have to be a competitor to end but it has to be better than bryson man it has to be but well it has to be usable it has to fill a usability slot the thing is is that eggs aren't that easy really is like they put out events but right now in the special events i can either do an egg event that gives me a boring egg result or i can spend my stamina in the christmas event and actually build up things to buy the better rewards and if i'm only playing you know the minimum amount of my stamina i will never go to the eggs i will never go into that banner because there's nothing in there that i'm like this is interesting this is going to get me something better than getting one of the coins or the candies from collecting other decorations in the christmas event yeah there's no draw there i just use the egg events to get enough eggs to fill my incubators and then i just pour the rest into like the n event or the the holiday event like you were mentioning earlier like it's literally i think it's like one egg every like three tickets is what i've noticed so i just spend spend the minimum amount of skip tickets in there and that's that's basically it i have 2125 skip tickets so oh i've never worried about skip tickets i've already had so many that's awesome i do exactly 10 things that gets me to 786 stamina i take my refill and then i'll do it again i never go beyond where it will fill me to max never i just like in the end event where you have where you get like the tokens and then you can do the polls i i just man the serotonin that's what i look for i haven't done any of the inevitable stuff yet i like it because it gives like there's some of them that give the five-star tickets the five-star pull tickets and then the the like final pools of the n event are what you need to do the final like level cap to hit 130 as your max level for n so i've just been grinding that out because i know if i this the sooner i do it the better yeah i'm like so far behind on events right now i've just been doing like daily vlogging there's a lot of events right now too that's another problem it's like there are five different events in there that i mean probably probably the best time to have a bunch of events since people are yeah you know they're not doing anything over the holidays no school people are off work but if you're like me i have other mortgage things to do my time is like at home like there's like there's like two of them that are just like collect your rewards right it's like the jesse and james one and then there's another it's just there but like if you collect the rewards they don't go away it's like please leave i don't need you anymore all right no pokemon of the week since uh will is not here but we have uh we have some questions of the week do we yeah okay we i think we do did i remember to do it you did okay so do my shall i do my ditty sure time for the question of it's the question of the week so why don't you ask it we may be squeezing two this one's from mark if the year 2020 was a pokemon which would it be okay well that was already established it was quillfish no absol it's absolutely a garbodor oh dang those are two good choices uh no gigantomax carburetor but he has a toy boat in his body and that's kind of cute man i don't like it i guess max government happened this year not a lot but there were some but more importantly is we all know that 2019 was their practice and 2020 was the year of cool fish it was not nobody signed up on that that was not from the official pokemon company they did not send out a press release saying this is the year of miractis or quillfish well that's both of those are bad well there's a song about it though about the year miraculous official the transitive property there's an unofficial song that is still held up in a lawsuit may i remind you and i believe it is actually the year of goomer actus more importantly i don't know where i was going with this when we pick when ise picks a year of pokemon we are putting that pokemon on a pedestal so it gets the recognition it deserves miraculous is now some would argue world famous i am going to scratch the ise part of that out and say when steve decides uh-huh i'm not disagreeing here and nobody else agrees and so 2020 was the year cool fish it was not why what you never even come up with reasons why because you just said you needed to be in the the spotlight for some time but why now who who in the world was crying out for quill fish who knew you here who grabbed your eyes that no one that's exactly why i we here at it's super effective we stand up for the little pokemon and quillfish needed a a a push and so now we need to do that for 2021 we need to find a pokemon that needs some help but it has to be in sword and shield because otherwise no one can really help it so i i'm still thinking of what would be 2021 i kind of wanted to do spinner rack but it's been a raccoon and sword and shield no i say why not because why not that's a terrible reason you're fired it's better reasoning than like quill fish i mean you're not wrong but again when you set the bar that low coming up with something that barely scrapes over that bar is not good enough but see here's the thing in 2022 you have to one-up that and so if you if you take too big of a jump you know that's going to be this is that's going to be exponentially harder we are beginning to understand the atrocious part of your name because you are setting the bar so low for yourself you feel that you can do nothing you don't have any faith in your why not for 20 21. hashtag why not for 20 20 year of the dreepy drapey needs love trippy does not need love dreepy is surprised it's surprise trade is dedicated to dreepy i think it in in themes of in themes of miractus and quillfish do not evolve i think we have to pick this is what we should do we should set up uh like a bracket of terrible pokemon that may need some love that's also in and then have people vote so then when 21 21 we have a dedicated pokemon we i feel like 2020 didn't do quillfish justice but that that does make sense because that's 20 20 a nutshell mirantis mirack just had the lime miraculous some people thought that 2020 was also the year of miraculous but it was actually 2019. that's how impactful miranda was unimpactful people thought it'd switch over into the year yeah so i don't know there's a lot of non-evolving pokemon in the galler decks um well we have tertinator we have drampa those are two um done sparse is i believe oh it's the year the basket oh masculine no basketball is pretty popular oh i do like wishiwashi i think selecting wishy wishy-washy would actually be maybe okay already setting up 2021 to be a bad undecisive year well that's why we don't know wishy washy yeah i think wishy-washy might be it nah there's gotta be something there's gotta be something better kind of like wishy-washy all right well we'll put wishy-washy on on the backbone another question here is from haley what was your favorite pokemon related moment of this year it's a good question i can i i can start okay so this year has felt like it's been 5 000 years long so i'm trying to remember events if they happened in 2020 or not okay as you think i have a i have a moment it's not my favorite moment but it was a recent moment i planned out i planned out for like two months maybe even longer that i was going to get my original form on christmas day because i wanted to one complete my uh living decks and pokemon home you have to get all 898 pokemon in order to get my gear now that's not actually true you technically don't need like richie drago and reggie eleki but i wanted to get all 898 pokemon and then get my mcgear now i wanted to do it on my christmas stream thank you to anyone who came out to twitch.tv slash became mencast for the christmas stream it was very fun we the last pokemon i needed was kubfu so on christmas day we went to the isle of armor i skipped through all the dialogue i battled the girl that i can't remember her name clarissa knows best or something and then i got my kufu and then i moved him into pokemon home and then i synced with my pokemon bank and i forgot that i didn't i forgot in x and y i got a chest pin but i didn't involve it to chestnut so i had to like knock out like 200 spindles to get it to level 36. i transferred them all in and i got my original form magirno and then i completely forgot that pokemon home runs on utc time local time so it was like 8 p.m local time which is 2 a.m utc time so my original for mcgearna is a boxing day mageirana it is get 12 correct 26 20 instead of christmas oh that's the best that's a christmas miracle right there as i was turning level 40 you were getting your heart broken over mcgear now nothing nothing is sweeter to me but i did get them aguirre now so that was that was uh that was a good moment for the year all right what about you i think that my favorite moment was when the vivid voltage set list was announced and i saw that there was a fuller nessa because by golly batman it's my favorite gym leader i was i've been i've been screaming for like the last four sets give give the full arnessa i know it's coming and then it happened it arrived now i have the card and it's it's beautiful i don't know if it's psa 10 though well if it's not you might as well just throw it away no no no i have to have one in every language every language every language and every psa you need a psa ten nine point five nine eight point five it'll happen it'll happen and then i gotta go through every company and get every grade through that too greg what about you favorite pokemon moment was it hitting level 40. it was actually not hitting level 40. i think the first i'm gonna pick like the first week that crown tundra was out and dynamaxx adventures was i mean i still love doing them but like that first thing of everybody just like this is more fun than we realized like diving in you know saving their favorite legendaries just all that that whole section of just doing all those raids with everybody was just super fun like every once in a while you get those moments of where you just feel like everybody is on the same page and we're all just having a good time and nothing else everything else just sort of drops away because you're like okay who's got a landorus let's run this and try to get shiny at the end like that whole week of that happening that sort of structuring that was super fun to me um it's probably my favorite one it was not turning level 40 and getting that ugly hat um oh i actually might want to change mine ah here we go now that i thought of this uh giratina when it was in raids i i usually just save my raid passes for like mythicals and stuff because i missed all the events way back in the day when i thought i was too cool for pokemon and uh somebody needed one more person to do a tina raid and so i was like what the heck i'll help you out and i did it and then it was shiny i was like oh cool i don't need to get the shiny anymore because now i have it done and dusted yeah easy that might be my favorite event because i bet someone like a hundred gift subs that it would be it would be shiny and then boom well i think that's uh i think that wraps it up i think that's our this is the last episode of the year right because the next episode will be the third yeah a new year year of the throw you're the sock you're the socks it could be the year of the sock i'm i'm warming on year of the sock i like wishy-washy there will be an episode on the fourth i will be streaming on twitch the monday night tuesday night and wednesday night and
