[Music] (0:01 - 0:25)
what's up everyone welcome to the 441st (0:25 - 0:31)
episode of the pokemon podcast it's (0:29 - 0:34)
super effective i'm your host sbj (0:31 - 0:37)
with me whether they are 40 (0:34 - 0:40)
39 38 we don't know but we have (0:37 - 0:43)
greg here i mean what number are we (0:40 - 0:44)
looking for (0:43 - 0:47)
because i'm well over 40 in a lot of (0:44 - 0:48)
ways (0:47 - 0:51)
okay all right well you know last week (0:48 - 0:51)
was (0:51 - 0:54)
uh so if we if we look at the podcast as (0:51 - 0:56)
a movie you started out (0:54 - 0:57)
kind of optimistic at the beginning of (0:56 - 1:00)
the month and then we were in the (0:57 - 1:03)
the hero slump last week well (1:00 - 1:06)
here's the thing i had the game plan (1:03 - 1:07)
post thanksgiving (1:06 - 1:09)
after they ripped away cruelly my (1:07 - 1:10)
friendship bonus (1:09 - 1:14)
i had everything plotted out with exact (1:10 - 1:16)
with exact milestones of what needed to (1:14 - 1:18)
happen and then (1:16 - 1:20)
people and the game turned against me i (1:18 - 1:21)
cannot help (1:20 - 1:24)
that last week the game and (1:21 - 1:27)
people who i thought were friends turned (1:24 - 1:29)
against me in my quest to forty (1:27 - 1:31)
three people who were supposed to be (1:29 - 1:33)
giving me gifts to be best friends (1:31 - 1:34)
that could have been my best friends (1:33 - 1:36)
before to the end of the year (1:34 - 1:39)
vanished just ghosted me on the app i (1:36 - 1:41)
saw lord of the rings like 10 years ago (1:39 - 1:42)
it sounds like this (1:41 - 1:45)
[Laughter] (1:42 - 1:48)
and then niantic cruelly rips away my (1:45 - 1:50)
lucky egg xp (1:48 - 1:53)
that threw off my complete formula (1:50 - 1:57)
causing me to question my math i had to (1:53 - 2:00)
do a bunch of different things and i (1:57 - 2:04)
did not hit 40 on christmas day (2:00 - 2:05)
all right well we're gonna hold the (2:04 - 2:10)
suspense until the pokemon section (2:05 - 2:10)
also uh masterchef canada is terrible (2:10 - 2:13)
all right (2:13 - 2:16)
i need more episodes of australia and (2:13 - 2:17)
they just aren't there i know there's (2:16 - 2:20)
like 5 000 australian seasons (2:17 - 2:23)
which i'm not allowed to see i've been (2:20 - 2:25)
inducted into that cult (2:23 - 2:28)
australia i sort of get it i don't (2:25 - 2:31)
like use a lot of weird words but send (2:28 - 2:32)
more this way (2:31 - 2:34)
i don't want to torrent them all right i (2:32 - 2:35)
don't care that much (2:34 - 2:39)
as uh end of 2020 surprise we have a new (2:35 - 2:42)
guest on the show we got jake here hello (2:39 - 2:45)
i'm jake uh i don't know what else what (2:42 - 2:46)
do you need to know (2:45 - 2:48)
what do you what do you do who are you (2:46 - 2:50)
how did you how did you get to the show (2:48 - 2:52)
why why don't we know you why should we (2:50 - 2:54)
care about you that's true (2:52 - 2:55)
that's true some people might know you (2:54 - 2:57)
so a lot of people probably know me (2:55 - 3:01)
as atrocious gameplay over on twitch i (2:57 - 3:02)
helped steve (3:01 - 3:04)
make his youtube videos been listening (3:02 - 3:06)
to the podcast for (3:04 - 3:09)
three years now almost it was like right (3:06 - 3:12)
it was during your japan trip was that (3:09 - 3:13)
like three years ago almost (3:12 - 3:15)
the spring two years something like that (3:13 - 3:17)
going to be two years ago (3:15 - 3:19)
two years well i don't know time flies (3:17 - 3:20)
when you're having fun i guess it is 20 (3:19 - 3:21)
20. (3:20 - 3:24)
yeah gosh it's almost 20 21. please (3:21 - 3:26)
come closer uh but i'm a graduate school (3:24 - 3:28)
student i love pokemon (3:26 - 3:32)
uh i work full-time in college sports (3:28 - 3:35)
i do stuff for steve and a lot of other (3:32 - 3:37)
things steve real breaking nate (3:35 - 3:39)
a couple other people as well i do have (3:37 - 3:41)
a fundamental question that i've had (3:39 - 3:43)
ever since i became aware (3:41 - 3:47)
of atrocious i have a fundamental answer (3:43 - 3:50)
okay atrocious by definition is a very (3:47 - 3:51)
poor quality (3:50 - 3:54)
extremely bad or unpleasant (3:51 - 3:56)
do you have a dictionary in front of you (3:54 - 3:58)
right now (3:56 - 4:01)
none of your business got the old (3:58 - 4:02)
webster (4:01 - 4:05)
got webster's in my lives with me in my (4:02 - 4:06)
house (4:05 - 4:09)
of those qualities what would drive me (4:06 - 4:10)
to watch (4:09 - 4:13)
said gameplay or gaming i am (4:10 - 4:16)
very aware how bad i am at video games (4:13 - 4:19)
and so i make it i make it somewhat of a (4:16 - 4:20)
joke (4:19 - 4:22)
you know anything anything bad that (4:20 - 4:24)
happens you know i i lose a battle (4:22 - 4:27)
in pokemon or you know i lose a trading (4:24 - 4:28)
card game battle (4:27 - 4:31)
i'm just like i just toss it up to you (4:28 - 4:32)
know the old (4:31 - 4:33)
name and people are like part of the (4:32 - 4:35)
brand yeah it's it's (4:33 - 4:38)
it's part of the brand i'm well aware (4:35 - 4:39)
you know getting better every day (4:38 - 4:42)
because you can only go up from here is (4:39 - 4:43)
there some point (4:42 - 4:46)
when the atrocious will be removed or (4:43 - 4:48)
will this forever be a crutch that you (4:46 - 4:49)
fall back on (4:48 - 4:51)
so that if you have a bad show you'll (4:49 - 4:53)
say well it's in the name you can't (4:51 - 4:55)
blame me for being bad (4:53 - 4:56)
or will someday you leave the crutch (4:55 - 4:59)
behind this is the fundamental question (4:56 - 5:01)
if you want to get dental you are going (4:59 - 5:03)
to fundamentally have to improve and (5:01 - 5:04)
that means dropping atrocious (5:03 - 5:07)
see i thought about that too because uh (5:04 - 5:09)
it wasn't until (5:07 - 5:12)
probably june (5:09 - 5:15)
that i've that i started realizing like (5:12 - 5:17)
oh i could do like youtube editing and (5:15 - 5:19)
stuff because college sports is (5:17 - 5:21)
a nightmare that we don't have to talk (5:19 - 5:24)
about today but (5:21 - 5:27)
atrocious gameplay decent editing (5:24 - 5:31)
yes we're trying to rebrand to (5:27 - 5:34)
great at great editing from atrocious (5:31 - 5:35)
gameplay (5:34 - 5:37)
if you if you thought forward you would (5:35 - 5:38)
have already had like the twitter and (5:37 - 5:40)
the twitch handles of like mediocre (5:38 - 5:41)
gameplay (5:40 - 5:43)
getting better gameplay what's the (5:41 - 5:45)
five-year brand plan here (5:43 - 5:48)
see when i when i made the when i made (5:45 - 5:50)
the brand there was no five-year plan (5:48 - 5:52)
it was just all let's meme for the (5:50 - 5:53)
atrocious (5:52 - 5:57)
man he played games yeah apparently the (5:53 - 5:59)
approach is extends to other aspects (5:57 - 6:01)
we are only beginning to uncover this (5:59 - 6:04)
nugget i'm fantastic college budgeting (6:01 - 6:07)
but there you go (6:04 - 6:09)
that's pretty good why are you why are (6:07 - 6:10)
you not helping people with their (6:09 - 6:12)
college budgets that seems to be the (6:10 - 6:13)
real brand (6:12 - 6:15)
because i took discovery of mathematics (6:13 - 6:17)
in college that was my math requirement (6:15 - 6:19)
well jake's gonna join us today for the (6:17 - 6:20)
episode will is (6:19 - 6:23)
uh i don't know in east virginia or (6:20 - 6:25)
something right now (6:23 - 6:29)
south carolina oh yeah sure (6:25 - 6:29)
close enough geography yeah (6:30 - 6:36)
i i took uh atrocious geography (6:33 - 6:40)
in uh in college okay so yeah will's (6:36 - 6:41)
over there he'll probably be back next (6:40 - 6:43)
week i think i actually don't know when (6:41 - 6:44)
his flight back is but (6:43 - 6:46)
it'll be some time it'll it'll happen at (6:44 - 6:47)
some point if it doesn't get cancelled (6:46 - 6:48)
again due to (6:47 - 6:51)
blizzard we have uh some pokemon go news (6:48 - 6:53)
some pokemon masters news we have the (6:51 - 6:53)
space (6:53 - 6:55)
news which i get we never actually (6:53 - 6:57)
talked about this was announced a while (6:55 - 6:58)
ago but it's coming up (6:57 - 7:01)
so we gotta cover that because luckily (6:58 - 7:01)
enough (7:01 - 7:04)
i'll be taking some time off of twitch (7:01 - 7:05)
when this happens (7:04 - 7:07)
but i know if i was streaming i know (7:05 - 7:08)
exactly what (7:07 - 7:11)
questions i would be bombarded with all (7:08 - 7:12)
day on twitch so (7:11 - 7:13)
it's kind of a blessing that i'm i'm (7:12 - 7:15)
taking off but (7:13 - 7:18)
before we get to any of that there was a (7:15 - 7:20)
sword and shield promote the i guess (7:18 - 7:23)
this is the new segment (7:20 - 7:25)
there's a sword and shield promoted (7:23 - 7:26)
event by the time this podcast goes up (7:25 - 7:28)
it will be over because it's always (7:26 - 7:31)
thursday night to sunday night (7:28 - 7:35)
but it was for the promoted raids of (7:31 - 7:39)
chandelure which is not super christmasy (7:35 - 7:40)
i guess but hey (7:39 - 7:44)
um alolan vulpix deli bird frost moth (7:40 - 7:46)
what's the last one i made a graphic (7:44 - 7:47)
about this and i can't remember it it (7:46 - 7:48)
doesn't matter (7:47 - 7:49)
jinx yeah see it doesn't matter no one (7:48 - 7:51)
wanted jinx (7:49 - 7:53)
uh incorrect there are a number of (7:51 - 7:55)
people who are running jinx raids and (7:53 - 7:56)
you chided them (7:55 - 7:59)
and treated them with disdain true (7:56 - 8:01)
so they did two things they increased (7:59 - 8:02)
the odds for (8:01 - 8:05)
vulpix to be shiny which last month was (8:02 - 8:07)
squivet and the month before was (8:05 - 8:10)
gorge ice and the month before was the (8:07 - 8:14)
clefairy clefable and then delhi bird (8:10 - 8:14)
had (8:14 - 8:17)
pretty decent bonuses uh but the other (8:14 - 8:18)
three (8:17 - 8:20)
not so much but that was a cool event i (8:18 - 8:21)
guess people (8:20 - 8:24)
really like people like vulpix so i'm (8:21 - 8:24)
sure (8:24 - 8:26)
that was all right weird thing is it (8:24 - 8:27)
doesn't look like uh anyone at the (8:26 - 8:29)
pokemon company (8:27 - 8:30)
was working because they never went out (8:29 - 8:32)
up on the website i don't think they (8:30 - 8:33)
ever tweeted it (8:32 - 8:34)
maybe somebody at nintendo was working (8:33 - 8:36)
because it was in the switch news but no (8:34 - 8:36)
one actually (8:36 - 8:39)
checks the switch news i mean those (8:36 - 8:41)
things are (8:39 - 8:42)
prepped long before anybody went on (8:41 - 8:43)
vacation yeah that's probably that was (8:42 - 8:45)
just that was a scheduled tweet (8:43 - 8:48)
they did tweet it i think or did they (8:45 - 8:49)
not tweet it we talked about this before (8:48 - 8:50)
the show did they tweet them they did (8:49 - 8:52)
not twitter i didn't think i saw (8:50 - 8:53)
anything about it (8:52 - 8:54)
nope i didn't see it i think the (8:53 - 8:56)
japanese twitter tweeted it isn't there (8:54 - 8:57)
like some culture thing in japan where (8:56 - 8:58)
they're always working they're not (8:57 - 9:00)
taking any days off (8:58 - 9:03)
i mean that's me that's here as well (9:00 - 9:05)
always working there's another brand (9:03 - 9:07)
that you can get oh yeah (9:05 - 9:10)
greg did you get your shinies uh (9:07 - 9:14)
no okay no shiny vulpix for me i tried (9:10 - 9:16)
you were playing last night when i was (9:14 - 9:17)
on twitch playing last night i was (9:16 - 9:18)
playing (9:17 - 9:21)
friday when you were playing as well (9:18 - 9:24)
i think i did honestly i think it did (9:21 - 9:26)
five (9:24 - 9:29)
or maybe ten five star vulpix and that's (9:26 - 9:29)
a lot (9:29 - 9:32)
yeah it happened and then so i was like (9:29 - 9:33)
i (9:32 - 9:36)
this isn't like i can't masouda this and (9:33 - 9:37)
i can be suited (9:36 - 9:40)
and get in the ball that i want so (9:37 - 9:42)
why don't i just do that and i stopped (9:40 - 9:43)
yeah it seems like it was like the (9:42 - 9:45)
squivet thing where if you were the host (9:43 - 9:46)
and it was shiny (9:45 - 9:48)
it was guaranteed catch but if you were (9:46 - 9:49)
a guest and it was shiny it was not (9:48 - 9:50)
guaranteed (9:49 - 9:52)
it was not so it seemed it seemed like (9:50 - 9:53)
that uh (9:52 - 9:55)
i got a number of hidden ability ones (9:53 - 9:57)
which i was very excited about (9:55 - 10:00)
uh oh the snow warning yeah jake did you (9:57 - 10:02)
get to participate (10:00 - 10:04)
i haven't even loaded up the game in (10:02 - 10:06)
probably the last like week and a half (10:04 - 10:08)
i've been focusing on like emerald and (10:06 - 10:10)
pokemon black trying to get completed (10:08 - 10:11)
copies (10:10 - 10:14)
in those generations um so then i can (10:11 - 10:15)
transfer (10:14 - 10:18)
a spam of jirachi's and become the king (10:15 - 10:20)
of the jirachi economy you know you (10:18 - 10:22)
inspired me with the deoxys so (10:20 - 10:26)
i am i am the diaxis king that's true (10:22 - 10:27)
yeah it was a it was a cool event i (10:26 - 10:30)
liked i liked how (10:27 - 10:32)
so in past events with like squabbit and (10:30 - 10:33)
gorgeous you kind of just ignore (10:32 - 10:34)
everything else (10:33 - 10:36)
so if anyone just got pokemon sword and (10:34 - 10:38)
shield and doesn't know how these events (10:36 - 10:38)
work (10:38 - 10:40)
i'm only saying that because christmas (10:38 - 10:42)
just happened what you can do is you can (10:40 - 10:43)
just spam wishing pieces (10:42 - 10:45)
in dens until you got the five star (10:43 - 10:47)
vulpix and then you do the (10:45 - 10:48)
five star vulpix to see if it's shiny (10:47 - 10:50)
but then you kind of ignore the jinxes (10:48 - 10:51)
and the chandeleurs (10:50 - 10:53)
whatever the other uh the frost moth but (10:51 - 10:55)
in this case the deli bird had (10:53 - 10:57)
better rewards than the other ones i (10:55 - 10:59)
just mentioned so (10:57 - 11:01)
i would stop to do the deli birds uh (10:59 - 11:02)
they gave really (11:01 - 11:05)
good amount of large candy and extra (11:02 - 11:06)
large candy (11:05 - 11:10)
which i'm loving i found a gold (11:06 - 11:12)
five-star deli bird and it gave me (11:10 - 11:13)
multiples of (11:12 - 11:16)
every type of candy yes so the so (11:13 - 11:18)
promoted raids cannot be (11:16 - 11:22)
gold so that was a non-promoted race no (11:18 - 11:24)
it was rare i found the rare one so the (11:22 - 11:26)
non-promoted deli birds (11:24 - 11:29)
can give you dream balls and i also did (11:26 - 11:31)
a gold deli bird this weekend and i got (11:29 - 11:33)
one dream ball from it and it was very (11:31 - 11:33)
awesome (11:33 - 11:36)
and that's always running and i've made (11:33 - 11:37)
graphics about that (11:36 - 11:40)
on instagram and twitter of there's (11:37 - 11:42)
a way to get every type of pokeball in (11:40 - 11:43)
the game (11:42 - 11:45)
so like beast ball you can get from (11:43 - 11:47)
dynomax adventure (11:45 - 11:50)
and then the other apricorn balls safari (11:47 - 11:51)
ball sports ball (11:50 - 11:53)
love ball lure ball you can get from the (11:51 - 11:54)
scam-o-matic (11:53 - 11:56)
and then the only one that was missing (11:54 - 11:58)
from the equation was the dream ball but (11:56 - 12:00)
anytime you do a deliberate raid in (11:58 - 12:01)
sword and shield (12:00 - 12:02)
as long as well the promoted raids don't (12:01 - 12:04)
count because promoted raids have (12:02 - 12:06)
set drops but delhi bird is always (12:04 - 12:08)
spawning in raid dens (12:06 - 12:10)
but they have a um anywhere between a (12:08 - 12:12)
one to three percent chance of dropping (12:10 - 12:12)
a dream ball (12:12 - 12:15)
so if that's your favorite pokeball get (12:12 - 12:16)
on that daily bird hunt (12:15 - 12:19)
24 7. anyways that event (12:16 - 12:22)
is over now let's talk about some events (12:19 - 12:23)
that are coming up (12:22 - 12:26)
which are the pokemon go events (12:23 - 12:29)
countdown to pokemon go kanto tour (12:26 - 12:31)
celebrating with the unova region (12:29 - 12:33)
i'm i think they're going backwards i (12:31 - 12:35)
don't understand (12:33 - 12:37)
i guess because we just had calos like i (12:35 - 12:39)
mean kalos just launched like two weeks (12:37 - 12:40)
ago (12:39 - 12:42)
three weeks ago i don't know if they're (12:40 - 12:44)
starting with unova i would assume that (12:42 - 12:46)
it would be like sinnoh next then hohen (12:44 - 12:47)
then johto then (12:46 - 12:50)
here we're at kanto i guess otherwise (12:47 - 12:53)
maybe i don't know (12:50 - 12:55)
i mean going backwards isn't bad is it a (12:53 - 12:57)
countdown thing are we supposed to be (12:55 - 12:58)
like (12:57 - 13:00)
countdown it does say countdown to (12:58 - 13:01)

are they giving up on community day (13:29 - 13:35)
if this is them saying there will not be (13:33 - 13:36)
a snivy committee today (13:35 - 13:39)
i'm angry i don't want to say like oh (13:36 - 13:41)
niantic figured out that (13:39 - 13:44)
starters are more valuable as community (13:41 - 13:45)
day things because they did charmander (13:44 - 13:46)
twice (13:45 - 13:48)
and also they probably would have (13:46 - 13:49)
figured that out i don't know (13:48 - 13:53)
like three years ago (13:49 - 13:53)
i this is like a weird choice (13:53 - 13:59)
yeah it's still better than soft (13:56 - 14:00)
resetting (13:59 - 14:03)
okay that's true so i'm happy (14:00 - 14:06)
that's not that's not even a comparison (14:03 - 14:07)
it's a love but (14:06 - 14:11)
it's like hi this i placed this bar in a (14:07 - 14:13)
grave six feet under it's better than (14:11 - 14:14)
that okay they (14:13 - 14:15)
i mean they could still just do (14:14 - 14:17)
communities right yeah (14:15 - 14:19)
they better we know machop community day (14:17 - 14:20)
is coming up (14:19 - 14:23)
obviously machap has been shiny before (14:20 - 14:25)
there there has been pokemon that have (14:23 - 14:27)
already like guess the guess is a (14:25 - 14:29)
good example um the following pokemon (14:27 - 14:30)
will hatch from 5k (14:29 - 14:33)
eggs rock and roller saladal petal (14:30 - 14:36)
imoga karablast joltik lgm (14:33 - 14:39)
and shellmet enjoy event exclusive field (14:36 - 14:40)
research (14:39 - 14:43)
that will have uh stardust lead to (14:40 - 14:46)
encounters with snivy ted pig oshawatt (14:43 - 14:46)
ferracid (14:46 - 14:48)
following pokemon will appear in raids (14:46 - 14:50)
snivy tepe goshawa (14:48 - 14:54)
timber dwell and clink hertier tranquil (14:50 - 14:56)
excadrill amungus will appear in three (14:54 - 14:58)
star raids like always three star raids (14:56 - 14:59)
are completely useless and a waste of (14:58 - 15:00)
your dollar (14:59 - 15:03)
this is also a really weird decision i (15:00 - 15:05)
guess i don't know what they're doing (15:03 - 15:07)
genesect holding a burn drive will (15:05 - 15:08)
appear in five star raids this is the (15:07 - 15:09)
first time the (15:08 - 15:11)
this form of genocide will appear in (15:09 - 15:12)
pokemon (15:11 - 15:15)
go be sure to have a chance to catch it (15:12 - 15:18)
note the shiny form of genesect will not (15:15 - 15:20)
be available during this event (15:18 - 15:24)
ripoff so there's no reason to do it (15:20 - 15:27)
use your free raid pass to get the decks (15:24 - 15:27)
entry (15:27 - 15:29)
and then never do another one again i (15:27 - 15:31)
guess the only reason to do it is (15:29 - 15:34)
if genesect is good for gbl but i (15:31 - 15:36)
i think people have already determined (15:34 - 15:38)
that it's not i mean you have a bug (15:36 - 15:42)
what is genesex typing just bug right (15:38 - 15:44)
i thought it was bug steel but if it has (15:42 - 15:46)
a fire if it has the fire (15:44 - 15:48)
drive does that it doesn't change its (15:46 - 15:50)
type i don't know how genocide works i'm (15:48 - 15:52)
not a genesect master (15:50 - 15:54)
i'm only a deoxys master uh it is bug (15:52 - 15:56)
steel (15:54 - 15:58)
with the ability download yeah it's the (15:56 - 15:59)
same as porgio (15:58 - 16:01)
uh when it's holding the burn drive its (15:59 - 16:02)
light turns (16:01 - 16:06)
red and its move techno blast is a fire (16:02 - 16:06)
type (16:06 - 16:10)
okay so still useless (16:06 - 16:13)
yeah yeah (16:10 - 16:16)
mega charizard mega blastoise mega obama (16:13 - 16:18)
snow will be pairing in mega raids (16:16 - 16:21)
mega charizard y will become more (16:18 - 16:22)

how does it feel does it you got to the (22:35 - 22:41)
real everyone to play this game again (22:37 - 22:41)
here's here's the one thing so we didn't (22:41 - 22:45)
have snow until (22:43 - 22:48)
christmas for the month of december (22:45 - 22:51)
on my lunch break i was driving around (22:48 - 22:52)
my neighborhood (22:51 - 22:55)
and hitting 20 to 40 stops (22:52 - 22:59)
to get gifts to come back home and then (22:55 - 23:02)
after work send an open gifts (22:59 - 23:05)
for 26 days plus (23:02 - 23:09)
catching things here in that it was in a (23:05 - 23:09)
word (23:09 - 23:12)
a nightmare did you master the excellent (23:09 - 23:13)
throw (23:12 - 23:15)
no well here's the thing there are so (23:13 - 23:17)
many things about this game that makes (23:15 - 23:19)
me so mad (23:17 - 23:23)
one of them is hitting three excellent (23:19 - 23:26)
throws in a row and it never staying in (23:23 - 23:27)
the ball (23:26 - 23:31)
and then missing the excellent circle (23:27 - 23:34)
by like a millimeter and that's the one (23:31 - 23:35)
that catches (23:34 - 23:38)
yeah that is infuriating and the amount (23:35 - 23:39)
of times (23:38 - 23:42)
of me sitting in my car as people drive (23:39 - 23:46)
by as i'm screaming at myself (23:42 - 23:46)
also brad's like can you start taking (23:47 - 23:50)
your car because i don't want (23:49 - 23:52)
people in the neighborhood to be putting (23:50 - 23:54)
on the neighborhood app (23:52 - 23:56)
why is this silver car driving around (23:54 - 23:58)
and stopping (23:56 - 24:01)
randomly throughout the day put every (23:58 - 24:02)
day at one (24:01 - 24:04)
uh were you were you grinding out lucky (24:02 - 24:06)
eggs as well or no (24:04 - 24:10)
yeah so this is part of why i was so mad (24:06 - 24:13)
at my experience denial is because i had (24:10 - 24:16)
a lot of myself i made my thing was i (24:13 - 24:17)
was not going to spend (24:16 - 24:20)
any money but i would buy one large pack (24:17 - 24:21)
of lucky eggs (24:20 - 24:24)
and if it happened in those eggs and it (24:21 - 24:24)
could (24:24 - 24:28)
according to my calculations then (24:24 - 24:29)
that was the amount of money i was (24:28 - 24:31)
willing to spend period if it couldn't (24:29 - 24:32)
be done without (24:31 - 24:35)
purchasing lucky eggs then i wasn't (24:32 - 24:38)
gonna do it so when that one failed (24:35 - 24:41)
i was angry so i did what every angry (24:38 - 24:42)
person does (24:41 - 24:44)
i complain to support and they're like (24:42 - 24:46)
well you actually got it we think but (24:44 - 24:48)
anyways here's a new lucky egg i got an (24:46 - 24:50)
extension on my lucky egg but yeah so (24:48 - 24:54)
i only lucky egged (24:50 - 24:56)
and timed out and this is the part that (24:54 - 24:58)
drove me the most (24:56 - 25:01)
up the wall was trying to time out and (24:58 - 25:02)
talk to people (25:01 - 25:04)
i didn't know and didn't know their (25:02 - 25:06)
names of when i was gonna hit ultra (25:04 - 25:08)
friends so i had to like stop sending (25:06 - 25:09)
them gifts and just say you had (25:08 - 25:11)
you just send me gifts over the next (25:09 - 25:13)
three days so i can time (25:11 - 25:15)
the lucky egg so the time that it failed (25:13 - 25:17)
with cody i had four people lined up and (25:15 - 25:19)
it failed for all four (25:17 - 25:21)
and that would that was where i was at (25:19 - 25:23)
last week when i'm like (25:21 - 25:26)
i am so angry at this game (25:23 - 25:28)
the messages are terrible it's like i (25:26 - 25:31)
was doing regis yesterday (25:28 - 25:34)
and bobby sent me the invite to (25:31 - 25:37)
the raid i clicked on the right section (25:34 - 25:38)
hit the orange (25:37 - 25:41)
box did the raid five minutes later i (25:38 - 25:42)
get a message (25:41 - 25:47)
bobby has invited you to a raid again (25:42 - 25:48)
no it's the one from five minutes ago (25:47 - 25:50)
yeah to be fair they had to roll that (25:48 - 25:53)
out very quickly this year (25:50 - 25:55)
[Music] (25:53 - 25:57)
uh i mean we've had it for so long (25:55 - 25:59)
though minus the fact they make like (25:57 - 26:02)
five million dollars a month seven (25:59 - 26:03)
months (26:02 - 26:06)
of this feature and that's not the only (26:03 - 26:06)
thing (26:06 - 26:10)
that comes in million minutes after it (26:06 - 26:11)
actually happened (26:10 - 26:16)
still faster than ptcgo but i will say (26:11 - 26:18)
the one good thing i i did realize (26:16 - 26:19)
during my trip (26:18 - 26:21)
around the neighborhood every lunch hour (26:19 - 26:23)
is there's not not a lot of people (26:21 - 26:25)
taking over gyms so i was getting my 50 (26:23 - 26:27)
coin bonus (26:25 - 26:31)
constantly i just go to a far out gym (26:27 - 26:32)
and plop a pokemon in it and then be (26:31 - 26:34)
like see you tomorrow (26:32 - 26:36)
yeah yeah i've noticed that the last (26:34 - 26:38)
like week where like gyms are not (26:36 - 26:40)
being taken down it's probably like a (26:38 - 26:41)
north (26:40 - 26:43)
a north united states thing because (26:41 - 26:44)
everyone doesn't want to leave their (26:43 - 26:45)
house yeah (26:44 - 26:47)
because it's too cold it's really cold (26:45 - 26:49)
and there's not a lot of (26:47 - 26:50)
i mean it's just not a lot of players up (26:49 - 26:52)
in my neighborhood anyways things don't (26:50 - 26:52)
turn (26:52 - 26:54)
over that much although i'm going to (26:52 - 26:57)
call scrooge on all the people who took (26:54 - 27:00)
down my holiday pokemon that i left (26:57 - 27:04)
throughout the city on the 24th (27:00 - 27:07)
bringing holiday cheer and all y'all (27:04 - 27:07)

all scrooges (27:10 - 27:14)
uh but i did hit 40 and (27:11 - 27:17)
i did all the things to get the stupid (27:14 - 27:18)
really ugly hat (27:17 - 27:22)
man i'm i'm very happy that i am ever so (27:18 - 27:25)
casual pokemon go player i just kind of (27:22 - 27:27)
load up the game every so often (27:25 - 27:29)
check check to see if i have any shinies (27:27 - 27:31)
find the winner shiny hat pikachu say oh (27:29 - 27:32)
look at that (27:31 - 27:34)
and then i catch it and then move on (27:32 - 27:36)
that used to be my life until this show (27:34 - 27:38)
how do you feel about texas (27:36 - 27:38)
[Music] (27:38 - 27:43)
[Laughter] (27:38 - 27:46)
indoor plumbing but now i'm now i'm free (27:43 - 27:49)
of my curse okay i have met the (27:46 - 27:51)
requirements (27:49 - 27:52)
did it feel good though did it feel good (27:51 - 27:54)
hitting 40. (27:52 - 27:55)
you got the badge you got the gyarados (27:54 - 27:57)
hat (27:55 - 28:00)
no champagne the the (27:57 - 28:03)
the good sensation was oh i don't have (28:00 - 28:05)
to care about this anymore (28:03 - 28:08)
that the release of having to do this (28:05 - 28:11)
was greater than seeing the 40. because (28:08 - 28:12)
that (28:11 - 28:15)
the 40 just meant oh you're done so like (28:12 - 28:16)
every mmo ever (28:15 - 28:19)
yep oh cool i finally beat that raid (28:16 - 28:20)
boss (28:19 - 28:22)
i'll never do this again i mean i do (28:20 - 28:24)
multiple raid bosses because (28:22 - 28:27)
they're fun but um seeing the 40 which (28:24 - 28:28)
of course (28:27 - 28:31)
happened 10 minutes after i hit it (28:28 - 28:33)
i finally got the screen and i wasn't (28:31 - 28:34)
prepared for it which is why the (28:33 - 28:36)
screenshot i took of it is so bad (28:34 - 28:38)
yeah i'm just relieved that it's done (28:36 - 28:40)
the like the thing is is that (28:38 - 28:42)
i had it plotted out very carefully i (28:40 - 28:45)
knew i would get it by the end of the (28:42 - 28:45)
year (28:45 - 28:48)
if everybody played nice the cody (28:45 - 28:50)
mishap really threw a wrench in that (28:48 - 28:52)
plan and i was not (28:50 - 28:53)
a hundred percent sure i was going to (28:52 - 28:54)
have enough people left well you can't (28:53 - 28:56)
trust cody you hit it (28:54 - 28:58)

on (31:11 - 31:15)
10 p.m exactly december 25th christmas (31:12 - 31:16)
day (31:15 - 31:19)
the pokemon company japan (31:16 - 31:22)
pokemon underscore cojp verified twitter (31:19 - 31:23)
tweeted (31:22 - 31:26)
that the 2021 space sunrise live is (31:23 - 31:27)
happening (31:26 - 31:29)
on the 31st now they've announced this (31:27 - 31:30)
before in the past (31:29 - 31:34)
uh they link to (31:30 - 31:36)
twitter can have events now so you can (31:34 - 31:37)
like yeah i don't it links to the like (31:36 - 31:39)
the twitter event where you can set a (31:37 - 31:40)
reminder which is kind of cool (31:39 - 31:43)
then the official pokemon the english (31:40 - 31:44)
twitter (31:43 - 31:46)
retweeted it and said like tune in to (31:44 - 31:47)
check this out (31:46 - 31:50)
and if you read the comments or exist on (31:47 - 31:51)
the internet for more than (31:50 - 31:54)
2.5 seconds you'll see a bunch of people (31:51 - 31:56)
being like diamond pro remakes (31:54 - 31:58)
[Laughter] (31:56 - 32:00)
well and the thought process behind that (31:58 - 32:01)
is because (32:00 - 32:04)
it's the s their thought process let me (32:01 - 32:05)
try to explain their thought process (32:04 - 32:07)
their first thought process is well it's (32:05 - 32:08)
space (32:07 - 32:12)
so that's palkia yep which is like okay (32:08 - 32:14)
i guess i mean there are better pokemon (32:12 - 32:16)
that represent space but that's (32:14 - 32:20)
like yes uh uh palkia does control (32:16 - 32:23)
space and then there this is the stretch (32:20 - 32:24)
they go well it's (32:23 - 32:26)
the sunrise and that's like a time of (32:24 - 32:30)
day so deal (32:26 - 32:31)
and you're like yeah you're you're (32:30 - 32:34)
really stretching there but (32:31 - 32:37)
okay it's like the plushies for (32:34 - 32:39)
that was in the uh nintendo or the (32:37 - 32:41)
pokemon directs and they were like let's (32:39 - 32:42)
go merrell oh (32:41 - 32:47)
right because they had like espionage (32:42 - 32:47)
the understanding is like pokemon the (32:49 - 32:53)
pokemon company (32:51 - 32:57)
isn't going to space (32:53 - 33:00)
so we need to unwrap what's happening (32:57 - 33:01)
here because i i think that's (33:00 - 33:04)
that's the problem the space sunrise (33:01 - 33:06)
live 2021 (33:04 - 33:09)
is being put on not by the pokemon (33:06 - 33:11)
company but by like (33:09 - 33:14)
i think i think the it's called kybo and (33:11 - 33:15)
they're sending (33:14 - 33:16)
it's it's being put on by the (33:15 - 33:18)
international space station so i'm gonna (33:16 - 33:19)
i'm going to go (33:18 - 33:21)
to the there's an actual website kaibo (33:19 - 33:22)
dot space (33:21 - 33:25)
k i b o dot space it's in japanese you (33:22 - 33:27)
can use google (33:25 - 33:29)
chrome to translate it i'm just gonna (33:27 - 33:32)
read it here in 2020 the daily lives of (33:29 - 33:33)
uh people around the world have changed (33:32 - 33:34)
significantly at the end of this year in (33:33 - 33:36)
the beginning of the new year (33:34 - 33:37)
i would like to deliver a message of (33:36 - 33:40)
kybo from the space to earth (33:37 - 33:42)
the upcoming kaibo space broadcasting (33:40 - 33:43)
station (33:42 - 33:46)
will challenge the first sunrise of the (33:43 - 33:47)
universe (33:46 - 33:49)
let's celebrate the first sunrise of the (33:47 - 33:50)
universe together (33:49 - 33:52)
on earth regardless of age gender (33:50 - 33:54)
occupation nationality race (33:52 - 33:57)
culture so that the new year of so that (33:54 - 33:57)
this (33:57 - 34:00)
the new year will be the year of kybo (33:57 - 34:02)
this time as well we will send (34:00 - 34:04)
from the program studio installed from (34:02 - 34:07)
the kaibo japanese experiment module (34:04 - 34:09)
of the international space station which (34:07 - 34:10)
orbits 400 (34:09 - 34:13)
km above ground that's not in freedom (34:10 - 34:14)
miles i don't know what that is (34:13 - 34:17)
uh kilometers kilometers details of the (34:14 - 34:19)
program will be announced on twitter and (34:17 - 34:21)
youtube as soon as they're added (34:19 - 34:24)
and then it shows who's part of the crew (34:21 - 34:25)
so there (34:24 - 34:28)
is uh it's a bunch of like japanese (34:25 - 34:29)
astronauts (34:28 - 34:31)
and then the most important part here (34:29 - 34:32)
like how does this involve pokemon (34:31 - 34:35)
is because there are sponsors for this (34:32 - 34:36)
event (34:35 - 34:40)
so the pokemon company is a sponsor of (34:36 - 34:41)
the event they (34:40 - 34:44)
paid money to put their name on (34:41 - 34:45)
something this is not new (34:44 - 34:48)
sports teams do this uh the olympics the (34:45 - 34:50)
well olympics is also sports (34:48 - 34:52)
i don't have to sit here and explain (34:50 - 34:53)
sponsoring but the pokemon company (34:52 - 34:56)
sponsored the spaceship thing (34:53 - 34:59)
coca-cola japan also sponsored the (34:56 - 35:00)
spaceship thing (34:59 - 35:03)
and twitter sponsored the spaceship (35:00 - 35:05)
thing even though the pokemon company (35:03 - 35:07)
japan and the pokemon company twitter (35:05 - 35:09)
are tweeting about this of course they (35:07 - 35:10)
would they paid a lot of money to be a (35:09 - 35:11)
sponsor (35:10 - 35:14)
but the the reach of like well it's (35:11 - 35:15)
existing (35:14 - 35:18)
in space means diamond and pro remakes (35:15 - 35:21)
is not is it's it's such a shallow view (35:18 - 35:23)
of like (35:21 - 35:26)
desperation of like i'm sure one day we (35:23 - 35:28)
will get diamond and pro remix (35:26 - 35:31)
i am sure that the pokemon company isn't (35:28 - 35:33)
paying the international space station (35:31 - 35:35)
and a japanese astronaut (35:33 - 35:38)
to watch a sunrise to then after the (35:35 - 35:39)
sunrise is over (35:38 - 35:41)
turn to the camera and say hey we're (35:39 - 35:44)
making diamond and pearl remakes i don't (35:41 - 35:45)
think that's happening (35:44 - 35:47)
i think what that is really going to (35:45 - 35:49)
happen is like a pikachu plush is going (35:47 - 35:50)
to float in space (35:49 - 35:53)
and or a bottle of coca-cola is going to (35:50 - 35:56)
float next to it (35:53 - 35:59)
i have just a translation i wanna know (35:56 - 35:59)
what (35:59 - 36:01)
what it's really supposed to say when it (35:59 - 36:03)
says the first sunrise of the universe (36:01 - 36:04)
because that doesn't sound like the (36:03 - 36:06)
right translation yeah well (36:04 - 36:09)
you know google chrome so (36:06 - 36:12)
the first sunrise of the decade (36:09 - 36:16)
the first sunrise of the earth (36:12 - 36:18)
the earth that like it's not definitely (36:16 - 36:20)
not the first sunrise of the earth (36:18 - 36:21)
we've had a lot of them and you could (36:20 - 36:23)
also say like well why did they sponsor (36:21 - 36:25)
the space station if it's not for (36:23 - 36:27)
some big announcement not everything has (36:25 - 36:28)
to be a big announcement i mean the (36:27 - 36:30)
pokemon company (36:28 - 36:33)
has or is recently partnering with gucci (36:30 - 36:35)
and the north face for clothing lines (36:33 - 36:37)
they partnered with long champ (36:35 - 36:38)
this past year they've partnered with (36:37 - 36:41)
bear walker they've partnered (36:38 - 36:43)
with a lot of brands especially in like (36:41 - 36:45)
the last five years (36:43 - 36:46)
it's to announce that the special raids (36:45 - 36:48)
at the end of january will be access (36:46 - 36:50)
yes and we talked yeah we talked about (36:48 - 36:52)
this we talked about this before the (36:50 - 36:54)
show started but (36:52 - 36:56)
i feel like hoenn is a better (36:54 - 36:58)
representation of space (36:56 - 37:01)
than diamond and it is it absolutely is (36:58 - 37:02)
they have a space station they have (37:01 - 37:05)
deoxys they have rayquaza (37:02 - 37:08)
raymond quasar the astronaut literally (37:05 - 37:11)
in the delta episode of omega ruby alpha (37:08 - 37:12)
sapphire you go (37:11 - 37:16)
into space and you do not meet palkia or (37:12 - 37:17)
dialga there (37:16 - 37:20)
you meet dioxxus who's like i'm going to (37:17 - 37:22)
come in infect your entire planet (37:20 - 37:24)
with my dna yeah and there's a lot of (37:22 - 37:26)
space pokemon there's clefairy there's (37:24 - 37:27)
star u (37:26 - 37:29)
there's deoxys there's does that mean (37:27 - 37:30)
that they're ultra beasts (37:29 - 37:32)
there's many air no ultra beasts they're (37:30 - 37:34)
frozen although ultra (37:32 - 37:37)
dimension why (37:34 - 37:37)
the door is marked do not open for a (37:43 - 37:47)
reason (37:46 - 37:49)
if they announce a game which i guess (37:47 - 37:51)
anything is possible (37:49 - 37:53)
that would be a very weird way to (37:51 - 37:54)
announce it (37:53 - 37:56)
it's finally announcing pokemon sleep (37:54 - 37:58)
because you wake up at sunrise (37:56 - 38:01)
oh please come on i need that so bad (37:58 - 38:04)
i've been waiting so long i feel like if (38:01 - 38:06)
any time (38:04 - 38:08)
they were to announce a game it would (38:06 - 38:09)
probably be (38:08 - 38:12)
on the 25th anniversary which they are (38:09 - 38:15)
not shy about reminding us of over and (38:12 - 38:18)
over that's like a year away though (38:15 - 38:21)
yeah uh but if you don't think in years (38:18 - 38:23)
if you expand your mind and you think in (38:21 - 38:24)
days it's only like (38:23 - 38:28)
60 days away that doesn't sound right (38:24 - 38:29)
but if you want a treat boy read the (38:28 - 38:31)
comments it is it is nothing but (38:29 - 38:32)
pictures of (38:31 - 38:35)
dialga and pictures of uh (38:32 - 38:37)
[Laughter] (38:35 - 38:38)
there's gonna be a lot of disappointed (38:37 - 38:41)
people let people dream (38:38 - 38:44)
steve if you look at the events tab and (38:41 - 38:46)
you look at the tweets of people talking (38:44 - 38:48)
about like the event itself with the (38:46 - 38:49)
hashtag (38:48 - 38:51)
there's one person that talks about how (38:49 - 38:52)
like (38:51 - 38:54)
maybe you get to change your form of (38:52 - 38:56)
deoxys (38:54 - 38:57)
i think that would be kind of cool like (38:56 - 38:59)
through pokemon go or (38:57 - 39:01)
home or something like that i think (38:59 - 39:03)
that'd be kind of nice (39:01 - 39:05)
because how do you how do you change (39:03 - 39:08)
your form of deoxys (39:05 - 39:10)
once it's in like you can't do it once (39:08 - 39:12)
you've put it in like (39:10 - 39:14)
home right no you can change it once you (39:12 - 39:15)
get (39:14 - 39:17)
well the access ain't moving out of home (39:15 - 39:19)
many times (39:17 - 39:21)
yeah once well you can't change any (39:19 - 39:22)
forms in home so it's like the same with (39:21 - 39:25)
like cast form cast form defaults (39:22 - 39:28)
um cherum i think defaults (39:25 - 39:31)
de-access defaults genocide defaults (39:28 - 39:32)

watching the ball drop yeah i think (39:49 - 39:53)
watching it's it it looks like it's (39:52 - 39:55)
streaming exclusively on youtube and (39:53 - 39:56)
exclusively (39:55 - 39:59)
on twitter which sunrise like what time (39:56 - 40:03)

start time but i don't know is that like (40:03 - 40:07)
utc (40:06 - 40:08)
or i don't know if that's utc or not (40:07 - 40:10)
because it doesn't say utc after it so (40:08 - 40:12)
i'm not sure if that's japanese time (40:10 - 40:16)
[Laughter] (40:12 - 40:18)
yeah i don't know i must say yeah i'm (40:16 - 40:20)
assuming there'll be like a pikachu and (40:18 - 40:21)
like a (40:20 - 40:23)

i don't okay whatever no i'm very (40:39 - 40:44)
confused well they're in space (40:42 - 40:45)
so they can see the sunrise at a (40:44 - 40:47)
different i don't know (40:45 - 40:48)
i don't know how space works that's why (40:47 - 40:50)
i'm watching the broadcast (40:48 - 40:54)
i mean so that means (40:50 - 40:57)
it's 8 45 p.m (40:54 - 41:01)
tokyo time no it's 11 45 p.m tokyo time (40:57 - 41:04)
on the 31st which means for us it would (41:01 - 41:05)
start (41:04 - 41:09)
at 8 45 p.m no it's until 8 00 a.m (41:05 - 41:13)

on the third 31st 30 31st (41:13 - 41:19)
30th no they're not that far ahead in (41:17 - 41:20)
time it would be (41:19 - 41:24)
it would be it would be 8 a.m the 31st (41:20 - 41:27)
for central time oh okay yeah (41:24 - 41:29)
because they're like 12 hours they're (41:27 - 41:31)
like 13 hours ahead i think (41:29 - 41:34)
time zones are hard this is off uh (41:31 - 41:35)
standard dot co (41:34 - 41:39)
dot uk gaming game director (41:35 - 41:41)
nagashima on why the pokemon trading (41:39 - 41:42)
card game is so (41:41 - 41:45)
popular (41:42 - 41:45)
because people love cards next this (41:45 - 41:50)
interview kind of got missed by a lot of (41:48 - 41:50)
outlets (41:50 - 41:53)
uh this interview was like shortly after (41:50 - 41:54)
darkness ablaze came out but i just (41:53 - 41:56)
wanted to pull it here (41:54 - 41:59)
uh tcg has sold over 13 30 billion cards (41:56 - 42:01)
in 13 languages (41:59 - 42:04)
nagashima was the one that initially (42:01 - 42:06)
helped create the card game based off (42:04 - 42:07)
the video game (42:06 - 42:09)
obviously the video game came first one (42:07 - 42:10)
of the questions was tell us about the (42:09 - 42:12)
sword and shield expanse (42:10 - 42:14)
expansion nagashima said sword and (42:12 - 42:15)
shield darkness ablaze the third (42:14 - 42:16)
expansion in the series was released (42:15 - 42:17)
this summer (42:16 - 42:19)
summer in japan technically um in (42:17 - 42:21)
addition to eternity's v-max one of the (42:19 - 42:22)
legendary pokemon from sword and shield (42:21 - 42:23)
darkness of blaze will also have (42:22 - 42:25)
charizard v-max fan favorite (42:23 - 42:28)
charizard makes its gigantomax debut in (42:25 - 42:30)
terms of the cards to look out for there (42:28 - 42:31)
are a lot of cards (42:30 - 42:32)
that we look forward to how players will (42:31 - 42:34)
use such as crowbat v (42:32 - 42:37)
and vika volt v i don't jake i don't (42:34 - 42:39)
think anyone's playing vika volt v (42:37 - 42:41)
um it was before rotation when like lost (42:39 - 42:42)
thunder was still around (42:41 - 42:46)
because you had electro power and (42:42 - 42:49)
um thunder mountain but now (42:46 - 42:51)
i mean you could play it in like you (42:49 - 42:54)
could play it like a peak around build (42:51 - 42:56)
or with mewtwo like a mewtwo box type (42:54 - 42:57)
thing but (42:56 - 43:00)
not not as much anymore no it's it's (42:57 - 43:01)
done now (43:00 - 43:03)
for the most part generally i'm involved (43:01 - 43:04)
in the overall direction (43:03 - 43:07)
of the game mechanics such as game (43:04 - 43:09)
environments design and game logic but (43:07 - 43:10)
i'm also (43:09 - 43:12)
somewhat involved in the art direction (43:10 - 43:14)
evening standards ask (43:12 - 43:15)
how have the mechanics of the game (43:14 - 43:17)
change over the years and stay relevant (43:15 - 43:20)
in an increasing digital world (43:17 - 43:22)
and nagashima says one of the key things (43:20 - 43:23)
that (43:22 - 43:25)
we feel has led to the popularity (43:23 - 43:27)
longevity of the pokemon trading card (43:25 - 43:29)
game is the face-to-face aspect (43:27 - 43:32)
of play paired with brands core values (43:29 - 43:34)
of friendship togetherness and friendly (43:32 - 43:35)
competition (43:34 - 43:38)
that's such a generic answer we like (43:35 - 43:38)
when people (43:38 - 43:42)
play each other across the table (43:38 - 43:43)
there have of course been many mechanics (43:42 - 43:45)
added to the tcg over the years which (43:43 - 43:46)
has helped the game feel fresh and (43:45 - 43:47)
different for players (43:46 - 43:49)
the strength of the game though is (43:47 - 43:51)
through face-to-face social connections (43:49 - 43:53)
it creates (43:51 - 43:55)
i often visit tournaments and leagues to (43:53 - 43:57)
see the people who have been playing the (43:55 - 43:58)
game since they were kids and now with (43:57 - 44:00)
their own kids i've known these players (43:58 - 44:01)
for many years the community has (44:00 - 44:02)
continued to grow (44:01 - 44:04)
in my opinion you don't get the same (44:02 - 44:06)
feeling with a digital only product and (44:04 - 44:08)
that's what makes the pokemon tcg so (44:06 - 44:09)
special and mean so much to our current (44:08 - 44:10)
players (44:09 - 44:12)
our current focus remains on creating (44:10 - 44:14)
the best physical products we can for (44:12 - 44:15)
our players but of course we always (44:14 - 44:18)
are exploring new ideas not specifically (44:15 - 44:20)
as a way to counter the impact of the (44:18 - 44:21)
digital environment but to remain (44:20 - 44:22)
relevant to (44:21 - 44:25)
a current fan based appeal to new fans (44:22 - 44:26)
across the globe (44:25 - 44:29)
i mean the the tcg is like at the height (44:26 - 44:31)
of popularity and there has been (44:29 - 44:33)
zero face-to-face encounters in the last (44:31 - 44:35)
year (44:33 - 44:37)
they've been doing tournaments in japan (44:35 - 44:39)
yeah they have the weird class thing (44:37 - 44:41)
yeah which i've gone pretty well from (44:39 - 44:43)
like the matches that i've been able to (44:41 - 44:45)
watch like streamed on youtube and stuff (44:43 - 44:46)
but (44:45 - 44:49)
yeah in the in the states and everywhere (44:46 - 44:51)
else it's local store owners holding (44:49 - 44:53)
events that are not (44:51 - 44:56)
official pokemon events it's just that (44:53 - 44:58)
like that whole comment worries me that (44:56 - 44:59)
like (44:58 - 45:01)
we know that the pokemon trading card (44:59 - 45:02)
game online is a (45:01 - 45:06)
primary primarily a us product (45:02 - 45:08)
there's no way for like a japanese fan (45:06 - 45:10)
to play it and it worries me that (45:08 - 45:13)
nagashima and staff goes like ah we (45:10 - 45:14)
think digital (45:13 - 45:17)
is is bad and may hurt card sales or (45:14 - 45:19)
just not a needed thing where in reality (45:17 - 45:20)
like (45:19 - 45:23)
magic is doing both very well like (45:20 - 45:26)
the magic digital card game is not (45:23 - 45:27)
hurting (45:26 - 45:31)
their physical card game right (45:27 - 45:33)
and so him saying that is seems like (45:31 - 45:34)
he's (45:33 - 45:36)
maybe maybe i'm reading too much into it (45:34 - 45:37)
but it seems like he's like we don't (45:36 - 45:39)
need digital to succeed (45:37 - 45:41)
yeah you're probably right but also (45:39 - 45:42)
digital is nice (45:41 - 45:44)
it's the only official way to play right (45:42 - 45:47)
now yeah literally (45:44 - 45:48)
it's great when the best cards in the (45:47 - 45:50)
game right now actually don't work the (45:48 - 45:52)
way that they're supposed to (45:50 - 45:55)
that's the best part that whole answer (45:52 - 45:57)
kind of worries me that they just (45:55 - 46:00)
don't have any plans for ptcgo um why do (45:57 - 46:02)
you think the card why do you think the (46:00 - 46:03)
game has remained so popular (46:02 - 46:05)
nagashima says we are fortunate that the (46:03 - 46:07)
pokemon brand as a whole (46:05 - 46:09)
continues to flourish and every year we (46:07 - 46:11)
see new fans beginning their pokemon (46:09 - 46:12)
journey throughout the video game (46:11 - 46:13)
animated series (46:12 - 46:16)
apps like pokemon go or indeed the tcg (46:13 - 46:18)
the video game does a great job at (46:16 - 46:20)
introducing new mechanics to pokemon (46:18 - 46:21)
each release (46:20 - 46:23)
which is a big part of their popularity (46:21 - 46:24)
which is true (46:23 - 46:25)
that's why there's always some sort of (46:24 - 46:29)
gimmick mega evolution z moves (46:25 - 46:31)
dynamics you have to have some gimmick (46:29 - 46:33)
to attract people (46:31 - 46:36)
the pokemon tcg meanwhile is based off a (46:33 - 46:37)
core (46:36 - 46:38)
charm of the franchise collecting (46:37 - 46:40)
trading battling pokemon you can enjoy (46:38 - 46:42)
the fun of pokemon in a physical way (46:40 - 46:43)
we are also very welcoming of a (46:42 - 46:45)
community that who wants to actively (46:43 - 46:47)
play the game starting at grass (46:45 - 46:48)
roots levels with leagues and (46:47 - 46:50)
tournaments at toy and hobby stores (46:48 - 46:52)
all the way to our world championships (46:50 - 46:54)
we have seen so many long lasting (46:52 - 46:56)
friendships formed over the year (46:54 - 46:57)
uh and that's kind of it there's more (46:56 - 46:59)
questions in the interview but it's (46:57 - 47:03)
it's like i always i appreciate that (46:59 - 47:03)
they (47:03 - 47:06)
get to interview big names like (47:03 - 47:07)
nagashima (47:06 - 47:10)
but i feel like they really just ask (47:07 - 47:12)
very generic questions and they get (47:10 - 47:14)
generic answers (47:12 - 47:16)
yeah i i read this a couple weeks ago (47:14 - 47:17)
when it came out and (47:16 - 47:20)
i was just like it was just another like (47:17 - 47:24)
set of words (47:20 - 47:26)
i i would just wish they would go more (47:24 - 47:28)
in depth of like why do you make (47:26 - 47:29)
charizard cards bad (47:28 - 47:32)
so bad why did you create (47:29 - 47:35)
adp that's the real question that i want (47:32 - 47:35)
to know (47:35 - 47:37)
and why do you keep making cards that (47:35 - 47:39)
make zashian better (47:37 - 47:42)
why are crowback cards always good who (47:39 - 47:42)
there (47:42 - 47:45)
loves crobat (47:42 - 47:45)
like there's nothing even saying like (47:46 - 47:49)
how do you think the pokemon trading (47:48 - 47:51)
card game has held up (47:49 - 47:52)
during this pandemic like that would (47:51 - 47:54)
probably be a pretty i don't know i feel (47:52 - 47:55)
like that's a pretty decent question (47:54 - 47:56)
like (47:55 - 47:58)
you you have a very physical product in (47:56 - 48:00)
a world where it's very hard to have (47:58 - 48:02)
physical interactions right now (48:00 - 48:04)
yeah and like your question though (48:02 - 48:06)
you're only like online events (48:04 - 48:08)
or like your only events right now are (48:06 - 48:10)
like the players cup and the team (48:08 - 48:12)
challenge so like why (48:10 - 48:14)
that's like literally free promotion (48:12 - 48:16)
right there i mean the interview came (48:14 - 48:17)
out (48:16 - 48:21)
december 4th from jack jack kesser (48:17 - 48:24)
um but darkness ablaze came out in the (48:21 - 48:25)
summer for japan (48:24 - 48:29)
and then it came out september for (48:25 - 48:32)
the united states so yeah like september (48:29 - 48:33)
august (48:32 - 48:35)
so yeah he he obviously interviewed him (48:33 - 48:37)
and then took time to like finalize the (48:35 - 48:38)
article and put out the article and (48:37 - 48:39)
stuff but (48:38 - 48:41)
i mean covet was kovit's been a thing (48:39 - 48:42)
all year so i'm not sure (48:41 - 48:44)
it's just it's a kind of a weak (48:42 - 48:46)
interview cool that he got to interview (48:44 - 48:48)
nagashima though (48:46 - 48:51)
speaking of competitions players cup 3 (48:48 - 48:54)

n has arrived to pokemon masters with (49:34 - 49:37)
zechariah (49:36 - 49:39)
i think we were i i was confident it was (49:37 - 49:41)
going to be resharam but (49:39 - 49:44)
lo and behold it was not resharing (49:41 - 49:46)
although i'm pretty sure i believe i (49:44 - 49:49)
said it was i'm pretty sure (49:46 - 49:51)
even though russian ram is kind of the (49:49 - 49:54)
main focus in like the games (49:51 - 49:57)
uh with with n because i think i think (49:54 - 49:58)
that's like the story default (49:57 - 50:01)
i think in the manga zekrom is this (49:58 - 50:04)
the story default for n they could also (50:01 - 50:06)
release another n (50:04 - 50:09)
yeah with pressure suit i don't know who (50:06 - 50:11)
they give rush ramp to though if they (50:09 - 50:13)
don't give it to end as well i still (50:11 - 50:15)

new years and just got released (51:27 - 51:33)
i did this to myself i don't know what (51:31 - 51:34)
to pull on now (51:33 - 51:36)
this is the banner problem this is what (51:34 - 51:38)
everyone's been telling you about is the (51:36 - 51:38)
banner (51:38 - 51:40)
but i like holiday sync pairs they're so (51:38 - 51:41)
cool yeah but (51:40 - 51:43)
i like all be on the same banner i like (51:41 - 51:45)
and no they shouldn't be on the same (51:43 - 51:46)
banner (51:45 - 51:49)
that was the problem with uh i i (51:46 - 51:51)
thought so at first that they should be (51:49 - 51:52)
on the same banner but they shouldn't (51:51 - 51:55)
because i who do they put on the same (51:52 - 51:56)
banner they put (51:55 - 51:59)
they put old rose old holiday rosa and (51:56 - 52:02)
old holiday cybold (51:59 - 52:05)
on a banner and i pulled on that banner (52:02 - 52:07)
i think i spent like (52:05 - 52:11)
12 000 gems which is 411 pulls (52:07 - 52:13)
and i ended up getting two cybolds and (52:11 - 52:14)
no rosa (52:13 - 52:16)
if i would have pulled one cybold i (52:14 - 52:18)
would have then switched the rosa banner (52:16 - 52:19)
because if they put (52:18 - 52:21)
if they put skyla and erica on the same (52:19 - 52:23)
banner and then you pull skyla (52:21 - 52:25)
then you still have to pull on that same (52:23 - 52:26)
banner for erica and then what if you (52:25 - 52:28)
get into skyla (52:26 - 52:31)
then you have a powered up skylab yeah (52:28 - 52:33)
it's not worth it i don't care about the (52:31 - 52:34)
flowers where's it in there look i'm a (52:33 - 52:36)
collector i want one of each i don't (52:34 - 52:39)
care about how good they are (52:36 - 52:39)
i mean that's how they make money off of (52:40 - 52:43)
you i think the problem here is just (52:42 - 52:44)
christmas and new year's are so close (52:43 - 52:45)
together so you get stuck with two (52:44 - 52:46)
holiday pairs and then what's our next (52:45 - 52:48)
holiday like valentine's day so that's (52:46 - 52:49)
like two months away (52:48 - 52:51)
it's like a month and a half yeah it's (52:49 - 52:52)
the 14th of february and then what's (52:51 - 52:53)
after (52:52 - 52:56)
what's after feb well like (52:53 - 53:00)
st patrick's day banners (52:56 - 53:02)
easter banner martin luther king's days (53:00 - 53:03)
banner (53:02 - 53:06)
uh president's day banner (53:03 - 53:10)
i can't wait for president day and (53:06 - 53:10)
my birthday banner did you paul did you (53:10 - 53:14)
guys get the end (53:13 - 53:16)
did you pull on the skyla what do we do (53:14 - 53:18)
i pulled on all of them (53:16 - 53:22)
and for the last three months every poll (53:18 - 53:22)
that i've done (53:22 - 53:25)
has been all three stars so i don't see (53:22 - 53:27)
the point in pulling anymore (53:25 - 53:30)
i did one pull for n on his banner (53:27 - 53:34)
and it was not a bleep bleep and i got (53:30 - 53:34)
three (53:34 - 53:37)
five stars one of them being n all right (53:34 - 53:41)
so the luck balances out i see here (53:37 - 53:43)
that is really good ends really i think (53:41 - 53:44)
n (53:43 - 53:46)
is the best like electric type thing (53:44 - 53:48)
pair the only problem that i have with (53:46 - 53:48)
it is (53:48 - 53:51)
outrage it just immediately confuses (53:48 - 53:53)
them and then it's a pain (53:51 - 53:55)
but if you pair with torterra torterra (53:53 - 53:56)
has that (53:55 - 53:59)
one ability with dawn where it gets rid (53:56 - 54:00)
of all (53:59 - 54:02)
status conditions so i've been liking (54:00 - 54:03)
that for when (54:02 - 54:06)
times get tough and i need to make sure (54:03 - 54:08)
that i don't get hit by confusion (54:06 - 54:10)
yeah i only have like 9000 gems i don't (54:08 - 54:11)
know what to pull on (54:10 - 54:15)
oh i only have 9 000 gems (54:11 - 54:15)
i have 1 000 and i have pulled (54:17 - 54:24)
garbage for three months can't complain (54:21 - 54:26)
about my polls (54:24 - 54:28)
can't complain about that but i i can't (54:26 - 54:30)
i will get more gems tomorrow because i (54:28 - 54:32)
get the 1500 (54:30 - 54:34)
bonus at the end of one of the everyday (54:32 - 54:35)
things (54:34 - 54:36)
because i make sure to log in every (54:35 - 54:39)
single day they did fix this (54:36 - 54:42)
well fix is debatable depending on who (54:39 - 54:43)
you ask but (54:42 - 54:46)
stamina is now replenishing every four (54:43 - 54:49)
minutes instead of every six minutes (54:46 - 54:52)
i'm not sure what the vibe on that is i (54:49 - 54:53)
haven't really played a lot in the last (54:52 - 54:55)
couple days because of the holidays but (54:53 - 54:57)
i really just play when my eggs are (54:55 - 54:59)
hatching like every 12 hours (54:57 - 55:01)
and oh i've given up on eggs that's a (54:59 - 55:02)
that's that's a bad (55:01 - 55:05)
that's a bad addition i just keep (55:02 - 55:07)
loading them in i don't really do (55:05 - 55:08)
anything else with them (55:07 - 55:10)
exactly you load them in you say not (55:08 - 55:12)
shiny don't care and then leave the (55:10 - 55:12)
daycare (55:12 - 55:14)
they did increase the daycare from 100 (55:12 - 55:16)
eggs to 200 eggs (55:14 - 55:20)
i got a free uh i got a free incubator (55:16 - 55:22)
i got a free incubator that's nice but (55:20 - 55:24)
like what it is is i just like if it (55:22 - 55:26)
doesn't have the three slashes (55:24 - 55:29)
i just tran or donate it yeah i'm gonna (55:26 - 55:30)
put in the next set of eggs (55:29 - 55:34)
yeah like the egg process feels so cheap (55:30 - 55:36)
they are just things that hatch not (55:34 - 55:38)
shiny not three dump it in the grinder (55:36 - 55:39)
move on (55:38 - 55:41)
it's such a weird pointless part of the (55:39 - 55:43)
game and none of those pairs are (55:41 - 55:44)
particularly good (55:43 - 55:46)
anyways they don't have any meeting they (55:44 - 55:48)
don't have like a story meaning you (55:46 - 55:50)
don't really bond with them they just (55:48 - 55:54)
appear not shiny don't care move on it's (55:50 - 55:55)
like the weirdest just (55:54 - 55:57)
thing that was tacked onto the game that (55:55 - 56:00)
literally nobody asked for (55:57 - 56:02)
i have shiny pairs and i don't know how (56:00 - 56:03)
to make them like (56:02 - 56:04)
real i don't know how to make them like (56:03 - 56:07)
playable pairs they just sit (56:04 - 56:09)
like maxed out with the affinities and i (56:07 - 56:10)
don't know how to (56:09 - 56:12)
like make them be playable in the game i (56:10 - 56:13)
just want to flex my (56:12 - 56:15)
triple well i can't because they're all (56:13 - 56:17)
my character but (56:15 - 56:20)
i want to be able to use my shiny pincer (56:17 - 56:20)
there (56:20 - 56:23)
was nobody because there's nobody that (56:20 - 56:24)
went out that (56:23 - 56:26)
asked about eggs that people were like (56:24 - 56:27)
yeah eggs are cool (56:26 - 56:29)
what did you just say about listening to (56:27 - 56:30)
fans i i i (56:29 - 56:34)
am the first to admit i must say (56:30 - 56:37)
so that applies to eggs as well like i (56:34 - 56:38)
think (56:37 - 56:39)
i think originally when eggs came out it (56:38 - 56:41)
was an interesting idea (56:39 - 56:43)
because people thought that they would (56:41 - 56:46)
be much more exciting and game changing (56:43 - 56:47)
than they are (56:46 - 56:50)
and instead their three star (56:47 - 56:54)
in a world that's now six star ex yeah (56:50 - 56:56)
that don't do anything special take a (56:54 - 56:59)
long time to power up to even get (56:56 - 57:00)
into playable battles and even if you (56:59 - 57:02)
power them up there's no combination (57:00 - 57:03)
that is ever (57:02 - 57:07)
above like third tier use it if you have (57:03 - 57:08)
nothing else (57:07 - 57:12)
yeah i mean i like does that dopamine (57:08 - 57:12)
hit of (57:12 - 57:15)
like i got a shiny like that's exciting (57:12 - 57:17)
and that's always fun and they're not (57:15 - 57:19)
like terribly hard to get (57:17 - 57:22)
it's not they're not invasive in a way (57:19 - 57:24)
where like you feel like you have to go (57:22 - 57:25)
out of your way to get them like they (57:24 - 57:26)
give you eggs pretty well (57:25 - 57:27)
and then if they end up being shiny it (57:26 - 57:29)
is fun but the problem the problem is (57:27 - 57:30)
like (57:29 - 57:34)
they can it's an easy fix they can make (57:30 - 57:36)
egg pokemon decent they just have to (57:34 - 57:37)
push an update being like (57:36 - 57:39)
okay well if you invest this much into (57:37 - 57:41)
the egg pokemon it will be on par (57:39 - 57:43)
with like it doesn't have to be on par (57:41 - 57:45)
with like a six star (57:43 - 57:46)
it doesn't have to be an it doesn't have (57:45 - 57:48)
to be a competitor to end (57:46 - 57:50)
but it has to be better than bryson man (57:48 - 57:52)
it has to be but well it has to be (57:50 - 57:53)
usable it has to fill (57:52 - 57:56)
a usability slot the thing is is that (57:53 - 57:57)
eggs aren't that easy (57:56 - 57:59)
really is like they put out events but (57:57 - 58:01)
right now in the special events i can (57:59 - 58:02)
either do an egg event (58:01 - 58:06)
that gives me a boring egg result (58:02 - 58:09)
or i can spend my stamina in the (58:06 - 58:10)
christmas event and actually (58:09 - 58:12)
build up things to buy the better (58:10 - 58:15)
rewards and if i'm only playing (58:12 - 58:16)
you know the minimum amount of my (58:15 - 58:19)
stamina i will never go to the eggs i (58:16 - 58:21)
will never go into that banner because (58:19 - 58:23)
there's nothing in there that i'm like (58:21 - 58:25)
this is interesting this is going to get (58:23 - 58:27)
me something better than (58:25 - 58:29)
getting one of the coins or the candies (58:27 - 58:30)
from (58:29 - 58:32)
collecting other decorations in the (58:30 - 58:33)
christmas event (58:32 - 58:36)
yeah there's no draw there i just use (58:33 - 58:37)
the (58:36 - 58:40)
egg events to get enough eggs to fill my (58:37 - 58:41)
incubators (58:40 - 58:44)
and then i just pour the rest into (58:41 - 58:46)
like the n event or the the holiday (58:44 - 58:47)
event (58:46 - 58:49)
like you were mentioning earlier like (58:47 - 58:50)
it's literally i think it's like one egg (58:49 - 58:52)
every like three tickets is what i've (58:50 - 58:53)
noticed (58:52 - 58:56)
so i just spend spend the minimum amount (58:53 - 58:57)
of skip tickets (58:56 - 59:01)
in there and that's that's basically it (58:57 - 59:05)
i have 2125 skip tickets so oh i've (59:01 - 59:06)
never worried about skip tickets (59:05 - 59:09)
i've already had so many that's awesome (59:06 - 59:11)
i do exactly 10 things (59:09 - 59:14)
that gets me to 786 stamina i take my (59:11 - 59:15)
refill (59:14 - 59:17)
and then i'll do it again i never go (59:15 - 59:19)
beyond where it will fill me to max (59:17 - 59:21)
never i just like in the end event where (59:19 - 59:23)
you have where you get like the tokens (59:21 - 59:25)
and then you can do the polls i (59:23 - 59:27)
i just man the serotonin that's what i (59:25 - 59:29)
look for i haven't done any of the (59:27 - 59:31)
inevitable stuff yet i like it because (59:29 - 59:32)
it gives like there's some of them that (59:31 - 59:34)
give the (59:32 - 59:36)
five-star tickets the five-star pull (59:34 - 59:37)
tickets (59:36 - 59:40)
and then the the like final pools (59:37 - 59:44)
of the n event are what you need (59:40 - 59:46)
to do the final like level cap to hit (59:44 - 59:47)
130 (59:46 - 59:50)
as your max level for n so i've just (59:47 - 59:52)
been grinding that out because i know if (59:50 - 59:52)
i (59:52 - 59:55)
this the sooner i do it the better yeah (59:52 - 59:55)
i'm like (59:55 - 59:57)
so far behind on events right now i've (59:55 - 59:59)
just been doing like daily vlogging (59:57 - 60:00)
there's a lot of events (59:59 - 60:02)
right now too that's another problem (60:00 - 60:03)
it's like there are (60:02 - 60:06)
five different events in there that i (60:03 - 60:07)
mean probably (60:06 - 60:08)
probably the best time to have a bunch (60:07 - 60:10)
of events since people are yeah (60:08 - 60:11)
you know they're not doing anything over (60:10 - 60:13)
the holidays no school people are off (60:11 - 60:14)
work (60:13 - 60:17)
but if you're like me i have other (60:14 - 60:19)
mortgage things to do my time is (60:17 - 60:23)
like at home like there's like (60:19 - 60:24)
there's like two of them that are just (60:23 - 60:26)
like collect your rewards right it's (60:24 - 60:28)
like the jesse and james one (60:26 - 60:30)
and then there's another it's just there (60:28 - 60:32)
but like if you collect the rewards (60:30 - 60:34)
they don't go away it's like please (60:32 - 60:36)
leave (60:34 - 60:39)
i don't need you anymore all right no (60:36 - 60:41)
pokemon of the week since uh (60:39 - 60:44)
will is not here but we have uh we have (60:41 - 60:46)
some questions of the week (60:44 - 60:50)
do we yeah okay we i think we do (60:46 - 60:50)
did i remember to do it you did okay so (60:50 - 60:55)
do my shall i do my ditty (60:53 - 60:59)
sure time for the question of (60:55 - 61:01)
it's the question of the week so why (60:59 - 61:04)
don't you ask it (61:01 - 61:06)
we may be squeezing two this one's from (61:04 - 61:08)
mark if the year 2020 was a pokemon (61:06 - 61:09)
which would it be (61:08 - 61:11)
okay well that was already established (61:09 - 61:13)
it was quillfish no (61:11 - 61:17)
absol it's absolutely a garbodor (61:13 - 61:20)
oh dang those are two good choices uh no (61:17 - 61:22)
gigantomax carburetor (61:20 - 61:24)
but he has a toy boat in his body and (61:22 - 61:25)
that's kind of cute (61:24 - 61:27)
man i don't like it i guess max (61:25 - 61:29)
government happened this year (61:27 - 61:31)
not a lot but there were some but more (61:29 - 61:32)
importantly (61:31 - 61:35)
is we all know that 2019 was their (61:32 - 61:38)
practice and 2020 was the year of cool (61:35 - 61:39)
fish (61:38 - 61:42)
it was not nobody signed up on that that (61:39 - 61:43)
was not (61:42 - 61:45)
from the official pokemon company they (61:43 - 61:47)
did not send out a press release saying (61:45 - 61:48)
this is the year of (61:47 - 61:51)
miractis or quillfish well that's both (61:48 - 61:52)
of those are bad (61:51 - 61:54)
well there's a song about it though (61:52 - 61:56)
about the year miraculous (61:54 - 61:59)
official the transitive property there's (61:56 - 61:59)
an (61:59 - 62:02)
unofficial song that is still held up in (61:59 - 62:02)
a lawsuit (62:02 - 62:06)
may i remind you and i believe it is (62:02 - 62:06)
actually (62:06 - 62:09)
the year of goomer actus more (62:06 - 62:10)
importantly (62:09 - 62:13)
i don't know where i was going with this (62:10 - 62:14)
when we pick (62:13 - 62:17)
when ise picks a year of pokemon we (62:14 - 62:19)
are putting that pokemon on a pedestal (62:17 - 62:22)
so it gets the recognition it deserves (62:19 - 62:25)
miraculous is now some would argue (62:22 - 62:28)
world famous i am going to scratch the (62:25 - 62:30)
ise part of that (62:28 - 62:33)
out and say when steve decides uh-huh (62:30 - 62:36)
i'm not disagreeing here and nobody else (62:33 - 62:37)
agrees (62:36 - 62:41)
and so 2020 was the year cool fish (62:37 - 62:43)
it was not why what you never even come (62:41 - 62:44)
up with reasons (62:43 - 62:47)
why because you just said you needed to (62:44 - 62:48)
be in the (62:47 - 62:51)
the spotlight for some time but why now (62:48 - 62:54)
who who in the world was crying out for (62:51 - 62:55)
quill fish (62:54 - 62:57)
who knew you here who grabbed your eyes (62:55 - 62:59)
that no one that's exactly why (62:57 - 63:02)
i we here at it's super effective we (62:59 - 63:04)
stand up for the little pokemon (63:02 - 63:07)
and quillfish needed a a a push (63:04 - 63:09)
and so now we need to do that for 2021 (63:07 - 63:11)
we need to find a pokemon (63:09 - 63:14)
that needs some help but (63:11 - 63:16)
it has to be in sword and shield because (63:14 - 63:19)
otherwise no one can really help it (63:16 - 63:22)
so i i'm still thinking of what would be (63:19 - 63:23)
2021 (63:22 - 63:24)
i kind of wanted to do spinner rack but (63:23 - 63:26)
it's been a raccoon and sword and shield (63:24 - 63:30)
no i say why not because why not (63:26 - 63:33)
that's a terrible reason you're fired (63:30 - 63:34)
it's (63:33 - 63:36)
better reasoning than like quill fish i (63:34 - 63:37)
mean (63:36 - 63:40)
you're not wrong but again when you set (63:37 - 63:41)
the bar (63:40 - 63:44)
that low coming up with something that (63:41 - 63:47)
barely scrapes over that bar is not good (63:44 - 63:48)
enough (63:47 - 63:51)
but see here's the thing in 2022 you (63:48 - 63:52)
have to (63:51 - 63:54)
one-up that and so if you if you take (63:52 - 63:56)
too big of a jump (63:54 - 63:59)
you know that's going to be this is (63:56 - 64:00)
that's going to be exponentially harder (63:59 - 64:02)
we are beginning to understand the (64:00 - 64:03)
atrocious part (64:02 - 64:05)
of your name because you are setting the (64:03 - 64:07)
bar so low for yourself (64:05 - 64:09)
you feel that you can do nothing you (64:07 - 64:11)
don't have any faith (64:09 - 64:13)
in your (64:11 - 64:13)
why not for 20 21. hashtag why not for (64:17 - 64:22)
20 20 year of the dreepy (64:20 - 64:24)
drapey needs love trippy does not need (64:22 - 64:25)
love dreepy is (64:24 - 64:27)
surprised it's surprise trade is (64:25 - 64:28)
dedicated to dreepy (64:27 - 64:32)
i think it in in themes of in themes of (64:28 - 64:34)
miractus and quillfish do not evolve (64:32 - 64:37)
i think we have to pick this is what we (64:34 - 64:38)
should do (64:37 - 64:40)
we should set up uh like a bracket of (64:38 - 64:41)
terrible pokemon (64:40 - 64:44)
that may need some love that's also in (64:41 - 64:47)
and then have people vote so then when (64:44 - 64:50)
21 21 we have a dedicated pokemon (64:47 - 64:53)
we i feel like 2020 didn't do quillfish (64:50 - 64:54)
justice (64:53 - 64:56)
but that that does make sense because (64:54 - 64:58)
that's 20 20 a nutshell (64:56 - 65:02)
mirantis mirack just had the lime (64:58 - 65:04)
miraculous some people thought that 2020 (65:02 - 65:05)
was also the year of miraculous but it (65:04 - 65:07)
was actually 2019. that's how (65:05 - 65:10)
impactful miranda was unimpactful people (65:07 - 65:12)
thought it'd switch over into the year (65:10 - 65:12)
yeah (65:12 - 65:15)
so i don't know there's a lot of (65:12 - 65:17)
non-evolving (65:15 - 65:20)
pokemon in the galler decks um well we (65:17 - 65:21)
have tertinator we have drampa (65:20 - 65:25)
those are two um done sparse is i (65:21 - 65:26)
believe (65:25 - 65:29)
oh it's the year the basket oh masculine (65:26 - 65:31)
no basketball is pretty popular (65:29 - 65:34)
oh i do like wishiwashi i think (65:31 - 65:36)
selecting wishy (65:34 - 65:37)
wishy-washy would actually be maybe okay (65:36 - 65:39)
already setting up (65:37 - 65:42)
2021 to be a bad undecisive year (65:39 - 65:44)
well that's why we don't know wishy (65:42 - 65:45)
washy yeah (65:44 - 65:49)
i think wishy-washy might be it nah (65:45 - 65:51)
there's gotta be something there's gotta (65:49 - 65:52)
be something better kind of like (65:51 - 65:53)
wishy-washy (65:52 - 65:55)
all right well we'll put wishy-washy on (65:53 - 65:56)
on the backbone another question here is (65:55 - 65:57)
from haley (65:56 - 65:59)
what was your favorite pokemon related (65:57 - 66:01)
moment of this year (65:59 - 66:05)
it's a good question i can i i can start (66:01 - 66:05)
okay so this year has felt like it's (66:11 - 66:14)
been 5 000 years long (66:12 - 66:17)
so i'm trying to remember events if they (66:14 - 66:19)
happened in 2020 or not okay as you (66:17 - 66:21)
think i have a i have a moment it's not (66:19 - 66:22)
my favorite moment but it was a recent (66:21 - 66:23)
moment (66:22 - 66:26)
i planned out i planned out for (66:23 - 66:29)
like two months maybe even longer that i (66:26 - 66:30)
was going to get my (66:29 - 66:33)
original form on christmas day because (66:30 - 66:36)
i wanted to one complete my (66:33 - 66:39)
uh living decks and pokemon home you (66:36 - 66:41)
have to get all 898 pokemon in order to (66:39 - 66:43)
get my gear now that's not actually true (66:41 - 66:44)
you technically don't need like richie (66:43 - 66:46)
drago and reggie eleki (66:44 - 66:48)
but i wanted to get all 898 pokemon and (66:46 - 66:50)
then get my mcgear now i wanted to do it (66:48 - 66:51)
on my christmas stream thank you to (66:50 - 66:53)
anyone who came out to twitch.tv slash (66:51 - 66:55)
became mencast for the christmas stream (66:53 - 66:56)
it was very fun (66:55 - 66:58)
we the last pokemon i needed was kubfu (66:56 - 67:00)
so on christmas day we went to the isle (66:58 - 67:02)
of armor i skipped through all the (67:00 - 67:03)
dialogue (67:02 - 67:05)
i battled the girl that i can't remember (67:03 - 67:06)
her name (67:05 - 67:08)
clarissa knows best or something and (67:06 - 67:10)
then i got my kufu (67:08 - 67:12)
and then i moved him into pokemon home (67:10 - 67:14)
and then i synced with my pokemon bank (67:12 - 67:16)
and i forgot that i didn't i forgot in x (67:14 - 67:17)
and y (67:16 - 67:19)
i got a chest pin but i didn't involve (67:17 - 67:20)
it to chestnut so i had to like knock (67:19 - 67:22)
out like 200 spindles (67:20 - 67:24)
to get it to level 36. i transferred (67:22 - 67:25)
them all in (67:24 - 67:28)
and i got my original form (67:25 - 67:32)
magirno and then i completely forgot (67:28 - 67:37)
that pokemon home runs on utc time (67:32 - 67:37)
local time so it was like 8 p.m local (67:38 - 67:42)
time which is (67:41 - 67:46)
2 a.m utc time so my original for (67:42 - 67:47)
mcgearna (67:46 - 67:50)
is a boxing day mageirana it is get 12 (67:47 - 67:51)
correct (67:50 - 67:57)
26 20 instead of christmas (67:51 - 68:00)
oh that's the best that's a christmas (67:57 - 68:01)
miracle right there (68:00 - 68:04)
as i was turning level 40 you were (68:01 - 68:05)
getting your heart broken over mcgear (68:04 - 68:07)
now nothing (68:05 - 68:09)
nothing is sweeter to me but i did get (68:07 - 68:11)
them aguirre now so that was that was uh (68:09 - 68:13)
that was a good moment for the year (68:11 - 68:17)
all right what about you i think that my (68:13 - 68:20)
favorite moment was when the vivid (68:17 - 68:20)
voltage (68:20 - 68:23)
set list was announced and i saw that (68:20 - 68:24)
there was a fuller (68:23 - 68:28)
nessa because by golly batman (68:24 - 68:30)
it's my favorite gym leader i was i've (68:28 - 68:32)
been i've been screaming for like (68:30 - 68:35)
the last four sets give give the full (68:32 - 68:37)
arnessa i know it's coming (68:35 - 68:39)
and then it happened it arrived now i (68:37 - 68:41)
have the card (68:39 - 68:43)
and it's it's beautiful i don't know if (68:41 - 68:45)
it's psa 10 though (68:43 - 68:46)
well if it's not you might as well just (68:45 - 68:48)
throw it away no (68:46 - 68:50)
no no i have to have one in every (68:48 - 68:51)
language (68:50 - 68:53)
every language every language and every (68:51 - 68:56)
psa you need a psa ten nine point five (68:53 - 68:58)
nine eight point five it'll happen it'll (68:56 - 68:59)
happen (68:58 - 69:00)
and then i gotta go through every (68:59 - 69:02)
company and get every grade through that (69:00 - 69:03)
too (69:02 - 69:04)
greg what about you favorite pokemon (69:03 - 69:07)
moment was it hitting level 40. (69:04 - 69:09)
it was actually not hitting level 40. i (69:07 - 69:11)
think the first (69:09 - 69:13)
i'm gonna pick like the first week that (69:11 - 69:15)
crown tundra was out and dynamaxx (69:13 - 69:16)
adventures was (69:15 - 69:18)
i mean i still love doing them but like (69:16 - 69:20)
that first thing of (69:18 - 69:22)
everybody just like this is more fun (69:20 - 69:24)
than we realized (69:22 - 69:27)
like diving in you know saving their (69:24 - 69:28)
favorite legendaries just (69:27 - 69:30)
all that that whole section of just (69:28 - 69:33)
doing all those raids with everybody (69:30 - 69:36)
was just super fun like every once in a (69:33 - 69:37)
while you get those moments of where you (69:36 - 69:39)
just feel like everybody is on the same (69:37 - 69:40)
page (69:39 - 69:41)
and we're all just having a good time (69:40 - 69:43)
and nothing else (69:41 - 69:45)
everything else just sort of drops away (69:43 - 69:46)
because you're like okay who's got a (69:45 - 69:48)
landorus let's run this and (69:46 - 69:50)
try to get shiny at the end like that (69:48 - 69:52)
whole week of that happening that sort (69:50 - 69:53)
of (69:52 - 69:55)
structuring that was super fun to me um (69:53 - 69:57)
it's probably my (69:55 - 70:00)
favorite one it was not turning level 40 (69:57 - 70:03)
and getting that ugly hat um (70:00 - 70:06)
oh i actually might want to change mine (70:03 - 70:07)
ah here we go (70:06 - 70:11)
now that i thought of this uh giratina (70:07 - 70:14)
when it was in raids i i usually just (70:11 - 70:16)
save my raid passes for like mythicals (70:14 - 70:17)
and stuff (70:16 - 70:20)
because i missed all the events way back (70:17 - 70:21)
in the day when i thought i was too cool (70:20 - 70:23)
for pokemon (70:21 - 70:26)
and uh somebody needed one more person (70:23 - 70:28)
to do a tina raid (70:26 - 70:29)
and so i was like what the heck i'll (70:28 - 70:32)
help you out and i did it (70:29 - 70:34)
and then it was shiny i was like oh cool (70:32 - 70:36)
i don't need to get the shiny anymore (70:34 - 70:39)
because now i have it done (70:36 - 70:43)
and dusted yeah easy (70:39 - 70:44)
that might be my favorite event because (70:43 - 70:47)
i bet someone like a hundred gift subs (70:44 - 70:50)
that it would be it would be shiny and (70:47 - 70:50)
then (70:50 - 70:53)
boom well i think that's uh i think that (70:50 - 70:55)
wraps it up i think that's our (70:53 - 70:56)
this is the last episode of the year (70:55 - 70:58)
right because the next episode will be (70:56 - 70:59)
the third (70:58 - 71:04)
yeah a new year year of the throw (70:59 - 71:07)
you're the sock you're the socks (71:04 - 71:10)
it could be the year of the sock i'm i'm (71:07 - 71:12)
warming on year of the sock i like (71:10 - 71:14)
wishy-washy (71:12 - 71:16)
there will be an episode on the fourth i (71:14 - 71:17)
will be streaming on twitch (71:16 - 71:20)
the monday night tuesday night and (71:17 - 71:21)
wednesday night and then i will be (71:20 - 71:23)

the 31st (71:25 - 71:28)

sign the paperwork until (71:32 - 71:38)
