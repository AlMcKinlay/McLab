read (2:01 - 2:06)
you like reading nope you like a good (2:03 - 2:07)
book what about (2:06 - 2:10)
manga (2:07 - 2:13)
what about it i've got all right if you (2:10 - 2:14)

consider picking it up i (2:14 - 2:20)
just started reading my summer of you (2:16 - 2:20)
yes greg you will enjoy it all right (2:21 - 2:27)
i i will sign on to that reading list (2:24 - 2:29)
but no i am not i am not a book reader i (2:27 - 2:31)
don't read a lot of books d person and (2:29 - 2:34)
uh uh a board game person where there is (2:31 - 2:36)
a lot of reading involved i feel like i (2:34 - 2:38)
mean i read (2:36 - 2:42)
i read rules stuff i read but i i i (2:38 - 2:44)
don't find enjoyment sitting down with a (2:42 - 2:47)
good book like that just about an audio (2:44 - 2:48)
book (2:47 - 2:50)
i do audio books sometimes okay i mean (2:48 - 2:52)
i've i've had to listen to a lot of (2:50 - 2:53)
things because brett knows that i won't (2:52 - 2:54)
read the books that he's reading so (2:53 - 2:55)
he'll (2:54 - 2:58)
uh and this was a problem when we (2:55 - 3:00)
commuted as he would say i got an audio (2:58 - 3:02)
book and so he'd put it in so i would (3:00 - 3:03)
hear things (3:02 - 3:05)
because he knew i would not read them in (3:03 - 3:09)
any other way so i know a lot of books (3:05 - 3:10)
i just (3:09 - 3:12)
of the things that i have to get done (3:10 - 3:13)
and the things that i want to do to (3:12 - 3:16)
unwind sitting down with a book is (3:13 - 3:19)
almost never on that list because if i'm (3:16 - 3:20)
going to read i feel like i should be (3:19 - 3:22)
reading my rule books to prep for (3:20 - 3:23)
something if i'm going to read i should (3:22 - 3:24)
be reading something to figure out how (3:23 - 3:27)
i'm going to do this next thing (3:24 - 3:29)
so i will listen to like (3:27 - 3:32)
audio podcasts like i'm into old-time (3:29 - 3:33)
radio so i've been listening to escape (3:32 - 3:35)
so i've been hearing a bunch of short (3:33 - 3:38)
stories about high seas adventure (3:35 - 3:40)
uh but i don't tend to like (3:38 - 3:42)
carve out time to just sit down with a (3:40 - 3:44)
book because i feel like i'm wasting my (3:42 - 3:47)
time (3:44 - 3:49)
got it (3:47 - 3:51)
well we're here to talk about pokemon (3:49 - 3:53)
not to waste your time (3:51 - 3:56)
no i'm wasting here and nope i feel like (3:53 - 4:00)
that's not mutually exclusive (3:56 - 4:00)
uh we have pokemon go news we have (4:01 - 4:04)
pokemon master news we got some tcg (4:02 - 4:07)
stuff we have some anime stuff and we (4:04 - 4:09)
have uh one bit of sword and shield news (4:07 - 4:10)
look at that (4:09 - 4:13)
sword and shield continue to get news (4:10 - 4:15)
pokemon legends not so much well (4:13 - 4:17)
scarlett and violet's not getting any (4:15 - 4:18)
news yeah for real (4:17 - 4:21)
yeah i mean it's uh (4:18 - 4:24)
it's going to be june soon uh and wow we (4:21 - 4:26)
know what that means pride month while (4:24 - 4:29)
there normally is e3 uh i don't think (4:26 - 4:30)
that's well that's definitely not i was (4:29 - 4:32)
gonna say i don't think that's happening (4:30 - 4:33)
but that's definitely not happening (4:32 - 4:34)
because uh but i would assume that (4:33 - 4:36)
companies still have (4:34 - 4:39)
news to present for their summer (4:36 - 4:41)
um well it's not like nintendo can't do (4:39 - 4:44)
the treehouse of terror from wherever no (4:41 - 4:46)
i mean yeah they've done it every year (4:44 - 4:49)
not being a part of e3 (4:46 - 4:51)
just at the same time (4:49 - 4:52)
uh let's get the pokemon go news out of (4:51 - 4:55)
the way uh first bit of news is the new (4:52 - 4:58)
season which is called the season of go (4:55 - 5:00)
um (4:58 - 5:02)
you know not the best name (5:00 - 5:05)
uh in the world but it's it's it's a (5:02 - 5:08)
season it's it's there is it spelled (5:05 - 5:11)
like the character from the anime (5:08 - 5:13)
it is not (5:11 - 5:16)
it is not (5:13 - 5:16)
um they already announced the next (5:17 - 5:20)
community days so the first one is going (5:19 - 5:22)
to be june 25th we don't know what it is (5:20 - 5:23)
yet (5:22 - 5:25)
july 17th don't know what that is yet (5:23 - 5:29)
and august 13th uh the june 25th seems (5:25 - 5:32)
to overlap with columbus ohio (5:29 - 5:34)
uh which is the (5:32 - 5:37)
international (5:34 - 5:38)
america international i don't know what (5:37 - 5:40)
they're calling it america international (5:38 - 5:42)
whatever (5:40 - 5:46)
uh different pokemon earlier earlier (5:42 - 5:49)
excel candy access so now if you're (5:46 - 5:51)
level 31 or higher you will be able to (5:49 - 5:54)
get xl candy as a reward (5:51 - 5:56)
uh the seasonal bonuses are increased (5:54 - 5:58)
friendship bonus damage during raids (5:56 - 6:00)
which they (5:58 - 6:02)
it's not a (6:00 - 6:03)
i mean that is a bonus but that's the (6:02 - 6:05)
thing they haven't removed yet from the (6:03 - 6:08)
remote (6:05 - 6:10)
well i guess they're saying all raids so (6:08 - 6:12)
i guess you're getting more damage (6:10 - 6:15)
locally so i suppose that that would be (6:12 - 6:16)
a bonus (6:15 - 6:19)
lure modules will last an hour instead (6:16 - 6:22)
of 30 minutes you will get one extra (6:19 - 6:24)
special trade a day that's a pretty good (6:22 - 6:26)
bonus (6:24 - 6:26)
you will get (6:27 - 6:31)
one extra candy when trading pokemon you (6:28 - 6:33)
will get guaranteed excel candy while (6:31 - 6:34)
trading pokemon which i think was a (6:33 - 6:37)
bonus not this past season this past (6:34 - 6:39)
season was seasonable but the season (6:37 - 6:41)
before that i think that was a bonus (6:39 - 6:43)
um (6:41 - 6:44)
and then you will get guaranteed (6:43 - 6:47)
gifts from pokestop spins (6:44 - 6:49)
increased damage for participating there (6:47 - 6:50)
it is there's the increased damage for (6:49 - 6:52)
participating in remote raids they (6:50 - 6:54)
haven't removed that yet but you better (6:52 - 6:56)
believe that's probably clear (6:54 - 6:58)
and then increased (6:56 - 7:01)
incense effectiveness while moving (6:58 - 7:03)
which (7:01 - 7:05)
they're reminding us that the incense is (7:03 - 7:08)
still buffed (7:05 - 7:08)
be since bef because before pandemic (7:08 - 7:12)
incense was like thir i'm pretty sure it (7:11 - 7:14)
was 30 minutes right it was like 30 (7:12 - 7:15)
minutes (7:14 - 7:18)
and it was (7:15 - 7:20)
like one pokemon every like three (7:18 - 7:22)
minutes when you're walking now it's (7:20 - 7:23)
like i don't remember (7:22 - 7:25)
90 minutes (7:23 - 7:29)
but what whatever that was an hour (7:25 - 7:32)
i thought it was 30 minutes (7:29 - 7:34)
ah i don't remember look that was 15 (7:32 - 7:36)
years ago (7:34 - 7:38)
if they keep changing things they'll (7:36 - 7:40)
always win because we'll never remember (7:38 - 7:42)
yep that's because i was a teenager (7:40 - 7:45)
that's what corporations do right (7:42 - 7:47)
they keep making changes and then you (7:45 - 7:49)
forget (7:47 - 7:51)
i i think the the takeaway here is ultra (7:49 - 7:53)
beast are coming since they showed (7:51 - 7:55)
natalie go and they showed wormholes we (7:53 - 7:57)
don't know how the wormholes work i (7:55 - 7:59)
don't know if i guess my worry is like (7:57 - 8:01)
oh are they just gonna stick ultra (7:59 - 8:03)
beasts and raids and call it a day yep (8:01 - 8:05)
um when they data mine stuff they did (8:03 - 8:08)
data mine actual wormhole thingies (8:05 - 8:09)
um (8:08 - 8:10)
so i don't know if they're gonna appear (8:09 - 8:12)
in the sky like hoopa and that's it that (8:10 - 8:13)
doesn't seem very great (8:12 - 8:15)
there's still the concept in my head of (8:13 - 8:17)
like (8:15 - 8:19)
um what are they called distortions in (8:17 - 8:22)
legends the big bubbles (8:19 - 8:24)
it would be really cool if distortions (8:22 - 8:26)
appeared and go in like a park of like (8:24 - 8:28)
oh this park has a circle around it and (8:26 - 8:30)
in the circle our specific pokemon for (8:28 - 8:32)
like five 15 minutes because it'd be (8:30 - 8:34)
really cool playing go to be like oh (8:32 - 8:36)
there's a distortion forming (8:34 - 8:38)
then you have a disaster like that eevee (8:36 - 8:41)
in central park that started a whole (8:38 - 8:42)
yeah i think it was an eevee i think it (8:41 - 8:44)
was a snorlax (8:42 - 8:46)
whatever it was because i'm pretty sure (8:44 - 8:49)
it was an eevee (8:46 - 8:49)
back when the game first came out yes (8:50 - 8:56)
um so uh oh some other things is like (8:53 - 9:00)
mewtwo is coming back to raids um (8:56 - 9:03)
some other stuff but (9:00 - 9:05)
i don't want to spend too much on go (9:03 - 9:06)
uh (9:05 - 9:10)
this week we also have that the (9:06 - 9:13)
seattle stuff has been revealed (9:10 - 9:16)
uh it will be at the seattle center (9:13 - 9:18)
if you uh i think tickets are still (9:16 - 9:20)
available they actually did a two (9:18 - 9:23)
niantics credit they did a smart thing (9:20 - 9:25)
they in the seattle i don't know if you (9:23 - 9:26)
i don't think either of you are going (9:25 - 9:28)
because we've talked about this (9:26 - 9:29)
but (9:28 - 9:31)
they're they're splitting the day into (9:29 - 9:32)
two (9:31 - 9:34)
and i love it so what they're doing is (9:32 - 9:35)
when you buy your ticket you can either (9:34 - 9:37)
you can either opt to start in the park (9:35 - 9:39)
for the morning and then go into the (9:37 - 9:42)
city in the evening or (9:39 - 9:44)
start your day in the city and then in (9:42 - 9:46)
the evening you will have the park so (9:44 - 9:49)
they're probably able to sell way more (9:46 - 9:50)
tickets because they're breaking the (9:49 - 9:52)
crowd into two (9:50 - 9:54)
and they're they're actually giving you (9:52 - 9:56)
an hour lunch break so they're saying (9:54 - 9:58)
between this time there's no event (9:56 - 10:01)
happening you have an hour to i mean i (9:58 - 10:02)
guess you can continue playing go but (10:01 - 10:04)
all the bonuses will be turned off (10:02 - 10:06)
i think that's really great (10:04 - 10:07)
um (10:06 - 10:10)
and we've talked about how (10:07 - 10:12)
you know will and i were we were at like (10:10 - 10:14)
a chicago go fest (10:12 - 10:15)
um i think that was the same one with (10:14 - 10:16)
steel (10:15 - 10:20)
greg was out there and (10:16 - 10:22)
some people we were with like refused to (10:20 - 10:24)
take a lunch break (10:22 - 10:26)
and they were like no (10:24 - 10:28)
fear of missing out fomo can't (10:26 - 10:30)
can't possibly it's like you can't stop (10:28 - 10:33)
for 15 minutes to get a hot dog and like (10:30 - 10:35)
whatever they're adults right but they (10:33 - 10:36)
don't want to eat they don't want to eat (10:35 - 10:37)
but then they're the same people that (10:36 - 10:40)
are like really cranky in the second (10:37 - 10:41)
half of the day because they did refuse (10:40 - 10:43)
to like not take care of themselves and (10:41 - 10:45)
you're like (10:43 - 10:47)
you it's it's just a different color (10:45 - 10:49)
pokemon you can take like a 20-minute (10:47 - 10:51)
break to get like a a yogurt or (10:49 - 10:53)
something (10:51 - 10:55)
no breaks if you're a true player that's (10:53 - 10:57)
true yeah that's true or you're not real (10:55 - 11:00)
on the ground for digital monsters if (10:57 - 11:03)
you're not if you're not 50. (11:00 - 11:05)
so um (11:03 - 11:07)
yeah i think tickets at least since we (11:05 - 11:09)
were recording this uh should still be (11:07 - 11:11)
available for seattle (11:09 - 11:12)
i (11:11 - 11:14)
so it didn't sell out (11:12 - 11:18)
it did not sell out yet interesting (11:14 - 11:20)
um (11:18 - 11:20)
they're yeah we (11:22 - 11:26)
they they said groudon and kyogre are (11:24 - 11:29)
coming back to raids so (11:26 - 11:31)
uh people are excited about that (11:29 - 11:33)
there are the habitat hours the city the (11:31 - 11:36)
planes the rainforest the tundra (11:33 - 11:39)
i think the only i guess bad thing is (11:36 - 11:40)
when they said like oh your day is split (11:39 - 11:42)
into two (11:40 - 11:43)
it's a little confusing and i would (11:42 - 11:46)
imagine that if you didn't pay attention (11:43 - 11:48)
or you didn't listen or when i went (11:46 - 11:50)
through the checkout process because (11:48 - 11:52)
somebody was asking me like oh when are (11:50 - 11:54)
you gonna play and i was like oh like (11:52 - 11:56)
at first i thought oh do you want a (11:54 - 11:58)
morning shift or an evening shift and i (11:56 - 12:01)
thought it was like oh yeah you have (11:58 - 12:03)
eight hours but your eight hours is (12:01 - 12:04)
either starting at 10 a.m or your eight (12:03 - 12:06)
hours is starting at noon that's kind of (12:04 - 12:08)
what i thought in my head (12:06 - 12:10)
so which is how they've done it before (12:08 - 12:11)
similar to how they've done it before (12:10 - 12:12)
yeah (12:11 - 12:14)
so i think that there's a there's a (12:12 - 12:15)
small chance where it would be really (12:14 - 12:17)
easy where it's like both you and your (12:15 - 12:19)
friends pick saturday but you flipped it (12:17 - 12:21)
where it's like oh i'm starting in the (12:19 - 12:22)
city in the morning and you're starting (12:21 - 12:24)
in the city in the evening so now it's (12:22 - 12:26)
like we can't play together because (12:24 - 12:27)
we're like (12:26 - 12:31)
opposite so that's like a small problem (12:27 - 12:33)
if you uh didn't coordinate well enough (12:31 - 12:36)
um and it is confusing until you look at (12:33 - 12:37)
it once you look at it you're like oh (12:36 - 12:38)
this makes way more sense but if you (12:37 - 12:40)
don't look at like the times and what (12:38 - 12:43)
like considered evening is (12:40 - 12:44)
uh like i saw a ton of people being like (12:43 - 12:46)
oh i'm just playing in the evening and (12:44 - 12:47)
it's like (12:46 - 12:49)
no you still have a morning shift it's (12:47 - 12:50)
just (12:49 - 12:51)
you're playing somewhere else in the (12:50 - 12:52)
morning (12:51 - 12:55)
um so it was again a little confusing (12:52 - 12:57)
but i think overall good (12:55 - 12:58)
uh (12:57 - 13:02)
just like look at it i suppose (12:58 - 13:07)
uh final bit is i went to (13:02 - 13:09)
missouri (13:07 - 13:10)
st louis (13:09 - 13:11)
to (13:10 - 13:15)
see if the niantic in person activation (13:11 - 13:16)
was worth it (13:15 - 13:18)
uh especially if you live like an hour (13:16 - 13:20)
away or you live like two hours away (13:18 - 13:22)
should you drive to go to (13:20 - 13:24)
one of the i don't know i think nice to (13:22 - 13:27)
get like 10 or 15 cities this community (13:24 - 13:29)
for in-person events (13:27 - 13:33)
um and it thunderstormed all weekend (13:29 - 13:35)
and so niantic never set up their tent (13:33 - 13:36)
because (13:35 - 13:37)
that would be dang (13:36 - 13:40)
safe safety right like it was like legit (13:37 - 13:42)
thunderstorming uh like lightning and (13:40 - 13:43)
thunder (13:42 - 13:44)
um (13:43 - 13:48)
and so i uh (13:44 - 13:49)
my thought process was like i don't know (13:48 - 13:50)
if they set up a tent or not right (13:49 - 13:52)
because they didn't communicate at all (13:50 - 13:54)
so i'm going to i went to walgreens i (13:52 - 13:56)
bought an umbrella i bought a two dollar (13:54 - 13:58)
poncho (13:56 - 13:59)
uh (13:58 - 14:01)
oddly enough at that event that i was (13:59 - 14:03)
talking about earlier where will and i (14:01 - 14:04)
went to go fest it was raining at the (14:03 - 14:06)
start of that event and people did have (14:04 - 14:08)
ponchos so i was like whatever i'm here (14:06 - 14:10)
i flew all the way here i got a hotel (14:08 - 14:12)
i'm gonna go to the park even if it's (14:10 - 14:14)
raining and i got there and there was no (14:12 - 14:16)
one there there were people that uh we (14:14 - 14:18)
met up with and it was very nice (14:16 - 14:21)
uh why wild community day let me tell (14:18 - 14:24)
you what happened here number one (14:21 - 14:25)
uh (14:24 - 14:27)
well it was a whole waste because (14:25 - 14:28)
niantic didn't set up their stuff but i (14:27 - 14:30)
met a niantic employee i'm gonna pin (14:28 - 14:33)
that we'll come back to that number two (14:30 - 14:35)
is (14:33 - 14:37)
uh i went to the gazebo that i said like (14:35 - 14:39)
oh like let's meet up at the gazebo i (14:37 - 14:41)
was and and (14:39 - 14:45)
the shocking thing happened (14:41 - 14:48)
people were there and they were trading (14:45 - 14:50)
it was weird (14:48 - 14:52)
strangers were talking to each other and (14:50 - 14:54)
trading and we we talked about this on (14:52 - 14:55)
the podcast like what two three weeks (14:54 - 14:57)
ago like how we've been to all these (14:55 - 14:59)
communities and no one talks to each (14:57 - 15:00)
other and everyone's just minding their (14:59 - 15:01)
own business (15:00 - 15:04)
but there were um there's like a mom and (15:01 - 15:05)
she brought her like two kids i would (15:04 - 15:07)
assume like one is eight maybe one was (15:05 - 15:09)
like 11 or 12. and they were they were (15:07 - 15:12)
very like i'm looking for lucky's anyone (15:09 - 15:13)
want to trade for lucky's and it was (15:12 - 15:15)
like kind of cute and they were like (15:13 - 15:16)
annoying little kids but like they were (15:15 - 15:18)
like they were very into lucky pokemon (15:16 - 15:20)
so that was cool and people were trading (15:18 - 15:21)
and then that another guy came up and (15:20 - 15:23)
he's like i'm looking for failings (15:21 - 15:24)
anyone got phalanx and he was like he's (15:23 - 15:26)
just looking for failings for like gbl (15:24 - 15:28)
and i was like this is wild to me like (15:26 - 15:30)
it is thunderstorming here we're in a (15:28 - 15:32)
gazebo and people are like actually (15:30 - 15:35)
communicating (15:32 - 15:36)
which has never really happened (15:35 - 15:39)
and then a more wild thing happened (15:36 - 15:41)
which this girl came up she was very (15:39 - 15:43)
nice she came up and she was like (15:41 - 15:44)
hey (15:43 - 15:46)
i want to do this mega blastoise rape (15:44 - 15:48)
can people help (15:46 - 15:49)
and i was like oh yeah sure she was like (15:48 - 15:51)
oh i've never done a mega blastoise and (15:49 - 15:52)
i was like oh yeah whatever like what i (15:51 - 15:54)
like mega raids i'll do whatever i'll (15:52 - 15:56)
help you out and then she said this is (15:54 - 15:58)
my first community ever (15:56 - 16:00)
and i was like what i was like did you (15:58 - 16:02)
just start playing and she was like no (16:00 - 16:05)
i've been playing for two years (16:02 - 16:08)
and i was like this is wild to me that (16:05 - 16:09)
you've been playing for two years and (16:08 - 16:12)
this is your first communion day ever (16:09 - 16:15)
i wish that was my life (16:12 - 16:17)
and i was like was niantic right (16:15 - 16:19)
did they change the time to move people (16:17 - 16:21)
closer together because everything like (16:19 - 16:23)
in their because in niantic's head right (16:21 - 16:25)
they want people to like trade they want (16:23 - 16:27)
people to like communicate they want (16:25 - 16:28)
people to raid together they want people (16:27 - 16:30)
to come out for their and it all (16:28 - 16:33)
happened at this event now the universe (16:30 - 16:35)
was just aligning for this right (16:33 - 16:39)
one anomaly does not a pattern make (16:35 - 16:41)
believe me having been to (16:39 - 16:43)
many of these (16:41 - 16:46)
that is an outlier as to what i will i (16:43 - 16:48)
will say there are people who scream i (16:46 - 16:50)
want to trade at every event that is not (16:48 - 16:51)
communicating that this is a person (16:50 - 16:53)
screaming out on a trade and we see them (16:51 - 16:55)
all the time (16:53 - 16:55)
it was cool though it was like really (16:56 - 16:59)
cool to see like somebody come out and (16:57 - 17:00)
be like hey this is my first community (16:59 - 17:02)
it's raining (17:00 - 17:03)
like they found a group of people that (17:02 - 17:05)
like everyone in the group was like (17:03 - 17:06)
really like yeah let's do the blastoise (17:05 - 17:07)
let's help you out and then she like (17:06 - 17:09)
actually hung out with us and walked (17:07 - 17:10)
like the rain eventually stopped for (17:09 - 17:12)
like 40 minutes and like we walked the (17:10 - 17:14)
park park was like (17:12 - 17:15)
dead dead understandably like it was (17:14 - 17:17)
thunderstorming (17:15 - 17:22)
um and then the niantic employee uh (17:17 - 17:24)
bless her soul she mentioned she worked (17:22 - 17:25)
for niantic and as soon as she did that (17:24 - 17:27)
people had a million questions (17:25 - 17:29)
uh and she was off the clock no i was (17:27 - 17:31)
full disclosure (17:29 - 17:34)
i i do i am in part of the niantic (17:31 - 17:36)
creator program and niantic tells me a (17:34 - 17:37)
bunch of stuff and then i'm not supposed (17:36 - 17:39)
to repeat that stuff and i'm also not (17:37 - 17:41)
supposed to say like oh this niantic (17:39 - 17:43)
employee told me this like (17:41 - 17:46)
to protect their privacy she was off the (17:43 - 17:47)
clock (17:46 - 17:49)
and she was more than willing to ask any (17:47 - 17:50)
questions (17:49 - 17:52)
but she ended up saying that she worked (17:50 - 17:53)
on the mega (17:52 - 17:55)
the new mega system (17:53 - 17:57)
and everyone was like i love the new (17:55 - 17:58)
mega system and she's like thank you so (17:57 - 18:00)
much and she even mentioned how she went (17:58 - 18:01)
on reddit the day it launched and she (18:00 - 18:03)
was like screenshotting like the (18:01 - 18:04)
positive comments and she's like we (18:03 - 18:06)
never get positive comments about (18:04 - 18:08)
changes we make and she was like really (18:06 - 18:10)
like legit happy and that was like cool (18:08 - 18:12)
to see and she was like i started (18:10 - 18:14)
niantica like a year ago and this was (18:12 - 18:15)
the first project i was on and it was (18:14 - 18:16)
being like (18:15 - 18:18)
like three other people and she said it (18:16 - 18:20)
took over a year (18:18 - 18:23)
to revamp the mega system (18:20 - 18:25)
and (18:23 - 18:27)
and somebody i think somebody there (18:25 - 18:29)
asked why and she said this (18:27 - 18:30)
and i (18:29 - 18:32)
i am just repeating back (18:30 - 18:34)
i know long time listeners of the show (18:32 - 18:36)
know i've said this before but she said (18:34 - 18:38)
the reason it took so long is because (18:36 - 18:41)
every single change we made (18:38 - 18:43)
had to go to the pokemon company in (18:41 - 18:45)
japan for approval and we had to wait (18:43 - 18:47)
for them to approve it and they had a (18:45 - 18:49)
lot of changes and we couldn't move (18:47 - 18:52)
forward until they approved it (18:49 - 18:54)
makes sense (18:52 - 18:57)
it's called corporations people (18:54 - 18:59)
and so it's just like (18:57 - 19:01)
it's just like this like (18:59 - 19:02)
yup (19:01 - 19:04)
this happens with everything like i'm (19:02 - 19:06)
sure that niantic picks a pokemon for (19:04 - 19:08)
community they go to the pokemon company (19:06 - 19:10)
the pokemon company says nah not that (19:08 - 19:12)
one well you're gonna do this one (19:10 - 19:13)
instead (19:12 - 19:16)
like every single change and it comes it (19:13 - 19:18)
it's even like as frustrating as some of (19:16 - 19:19)
the changes are like (19:18 - 19:22)
like the increase um money and the raid (19:19 - 19:24)
pass stuff there's no way the pokemon (19:22 - 19:25)
company didn't also be like yeah we (19:24 - 19:27)
would like 50 more cents per person per (19:25 - 19:29)
ray pass like (19:27 - 19:30)
like (19:29 - 19:34)
does it suck yes but like i it kind of (19:30 - 19:37)
to me it's like (19:34 - 19:39)
this is this is a thing in in apex (19:37 - 19:40)
legends where (19:39 - 19:42)
ea is considered one of like the worst (19:40 - 19:43)
companies (19:42 - 19:45)
worst gaming companies out there and (19:43 - 19:48)
respawn is considered like a very good (19:45 - 19:49)
developer like people really like (19:48 - 19:51)
titanfall people really like apex but (19:49 - 19:54)
when there's an issue with apex people (19:51 - 19:56)
refuse to blame respawn they just (19:54 - 19:59)
default and blame ea when it's been (19:56 - 20:01)
proven time and time again that (19:59 - 20:04)
no respawn is also making these (20:01 - 20:05)
decisions like why are we letting (20:04 - 20:07)
respawn off the hook like they're (20:05 - 20:10)
they're just as accountable as ea is in (20:07 - 20:12)
this and i feel like (20:10 - 20:14)
pokemon go fans just like to throw (20:12 - 20:16)
niantic under the bus and like do not (20:14 - 20:18)
give any accountability to the pokemon (20:16 - 20:20)
company when the pokemon company is (20:18 - 20:22)
signing off on every single one of these (20:20 - 20:23)
decisions like they're the shadow (20:22 - 20:26)
puppeteer man they're in the back nobody (20:23 - 20:29)
sees them pulling the strings (20:26 - 20:29)
i mean let's let's say that let's not (20:30 - 20:34)
say that pokemon company does not get a (20:32 - 20:36)
lot of flack for the stuff that they do (20:34 - 20:39)
like it's not like the pokemon company (20:36 - 20:41)
has had an easy ride from the fans over (20:39 - 20:44)
the last four years (20:41 - 20:45)
like (20:44 - 20:46)
let's be real (20:45 - 20:48)
it's not like they're like oh but (20:46 - 20:50)
pokemon the company is perfect yeah (20:48 - 20:52)
there's a small subsection that thinks (20:50 - 20:54)
niantic should not be a part of this (20:52 - 20:55)
anymore (20:54 - 20:59)
that's like a tiny amount (20:55 - 20:59)
um but she was she was incredibly nice (21:00 - 21:05)
and it was cool she she hung out with us (21:03 - 21:06)
and she was part of our group and we (21:05 - 21:09)
walked around and it was like (21:06 - 21:11)
first community day i i played with a (21:09 - 21:13)
group of strangers and it was really (21:11 - 21:15)
nice and everyone was nice and we (21:13 - 21:17)
exchanged friend codes and we we traded (21:15 - 21:18)
and (21:17 - 21:21)
um it for for (21:18 - 21:23)
for thunderstorming and pretty much only (21:21 - 21:24)
being able to play for maybe like an (21:23 - 21:28)
hour to an hour 15 minutes uh it was you (21:24 - 21:31)
know made the best of that community (21:28 - 21:33)
um but i don't know i don't know if the (21:31 - 21:35)
in-person activation is worth it because (21:33 - 21:37)
they never set it up (21:35 - 21:39)
while greg and i (21:37 - 21:41)
had a civilized wedding day of fine (21:39 - 21:43)
conversation and then i took greg to (21:41 - 21:46)
lunch for his birthday yeah and that was (21:43 - 21:47)
delicious (21:46 - 21:49)
i discovered i (21:47 - 21:50)
i don't think i can have beets anymore (21:49 - 21:53)
greg oh i don't think i can have beets (21:50 - 21:54)
anymore (21:53 - 21:55)
no (21:54 - 22:00)
why oh and they're so you know why age (21:55 - 22:00)
i (22:01 - 22:04)
that salad is so good though it is and (22:01 - 22:05)
now i've realized that every time i have (22:04 - 22:08)
it it's it's consequences (22:05 - 22:10)
but is it it could be other things in (22:08 - 22:13)
that salad that are consequences true it (22:10 - 22:15)
could be the cheese the goat cheese goat (22:13 - 22:19)
this is the most benign of cheeses (22:15 - 22:20)
maybe not your body look i think there's (22:19 - 22:22)
a lot of things that are benign to my (22:20 - 22:24)
body that you're like if i look at it i (22:22 - 22:25)
explode (22:24 - 22:28)

what do they call it in japan it was (25:54 - 25:57)
like the (25:55 - 26:00)
master championship journeys this is (25:57 - 26:02)
pokemon master journeys the series which (26:00 - 26:04)
not to be confused with pokemon journeys (26:02 - 26:07)
the series (26:04 - 26:07)
i i don't know i don't (26:07 - 26:12)
there but the in japan they're they're (26:09 - 26:15)
doing the the the tournament (26:12 - 26:17)
or they're gearing up for the tournament (26:15 - 26:19)
i think we're like (26:17 - 26:22)
i think we're 22 episodes behind (26:19 - 26:24)
so there should be (26:22 - 26:27)
probably like 20 to 40 more episodes (26:24 - 26:31)
before the galler arc is ended (26:27 - 26:31)
and there's still there's still articles (26:32 - 26:35)
and there's still people that believe (26:34 - 26:40)
that this is ash's final season (26:35 - 26:40)
yeah ash is gonna retire and it's gonna (26:42 - 26:47)
become (26:44 - 26:47)
well there are some people that are like (26:47 - 26:51)
oh go's gonna take over (26:48 - 26:53)
and it's like that was a nothing (26:51 - 26:55)
character without ash (26:53 - 26:57)
yeah i mean like go is just the opposite (26:55 - 26:59)
like ash is very emotion based and go is (26:57 - 27:01)
just very logical based like that's just (26:59 - 27:02)
what their friendship is and that's what (27:01 - 27:04)
it's always been and like yeah go is (27:02 - 27:05)
like (27:04 - 27:07)
slightly become a better trainer but he (27:05 - 27:08)
still doesn't care about that like ash (27:07 - 27:11)
is in the tournament go is not (27:08 - 27:14)
um that's because ash likes battling (27:11 - 27:16)
and like once they introduced project (27:14 - 27:17)
mew (27:16 - 27:19)
it was like oh this is where they're (27:17 - 27:21)
going to end go like when the series is (27:19 - 27:23)
over go is gonna be like i'm staying (27:21 - 27:26)
behind to participate in project mew (27:23 - 27:28)
because i want to find you like they've (27:26 - 27:31)
they've set up the ending for go right (27:28 - 27:34)
like the season's not gonna like even if (27:31 - 27:36)
we were like okay this is ash ash beats (27:34 - 27:39)
leon which is probably (27:36 - 27:41)
i don't know 50 50. either he does or he (27:39 - 27:43)
doesn't right 50 50. that's like the (27:41 - 27:44)
thing either he wins or there's two (27:43 - 27:47)
people he either wins or loses that's (27:44 - 27:50)
right so i mean chances are chances are (27:47 - 27:53)
strong that he loses i think it's more (27:50 - 27:57)
of a 60 40 split than a 50 50. (27:53 - 27:59)
okay so like like (27:57 - 28:01)
if ash wins (27:59 - 28:02)
cool (28:01 - 28:05)
he can still do the show he's already (28:02 - 28:08)
won alola it's fine he's already a (28:05 - 28:10)
frontier brain and he turned it down (28:08 - 28:12)
um if he loses (28:10 - 28:13)
cool (28:12 - 28:15)
he can do another tournament like he's (28:13 - 28:18)
been doing for 26 years (28:15 - 28:20)
like (28:18 - 28:22)
go either catches mew (28:20 - 28:25)
and then his ark is over that's what he (28:22 - 28:27)
wanted to do (28:25 - 28:29)
or he doesn't catch mew and they do the (28:27 - 28:33)
standard anime thing of like i'm staying (28:29 - 28:36)
behind to work on project mew because i (28:33 - 28:38)
haven't accomplished this (28:36 - 28:41)
which is like (28:38 - 28:44)
yes that's the logical conclusion there (28:41 - 28:47)
well i mean ash has to adventure through (28:44 - 28:49)
the risotto region for scarlet and (28:47 - 28:52)
violet so (28:49 - 28:52)
yeah um (28:54 - 28:57)
yep (28:57 - 29:00)
it's not like they haven't taken really (28:58 - 29:02)
good characters away from us i don't (29:00 - 29:04)
know like brock and misty people that (29:02 - 29:07)
and like we're like you know what i know (29:04 - 29:08)
we know you guys love these two (29:07 - 29:09)
characters (29:08 - 29:12)
do you like may and max do you like don (29:09 - 29:16)
and clement 100 iris (29:12 - 29:19)
never like crazy clemont's dad did i (29:16 - 29:21)
like cleveland's stats (29:19 - 29:23)
for sure iris never (29:21 - 29:27)
tracy absolutely not (29:23 - 29:29)
iris (29:27 - 29:30)
if they would have dropped the you're (29:29 - 29:32)
such a kid catchphrase i would have (29:30 - 29:33)
liked it it was (29:32 - 29:35)
translated poorly (29:33 - 29:38)
if you heard it in japanese it was fine (29:35 - 29:41)
what was it in japanese yankideska i (29:38 - 29:42)
don't know (29:41 - 29:45)
you're such a yankee (29:42 - 29:45)
ohayo gozaimasu (29:46 - 29:49)
there's no way they drop ash it's just i (29:50 - 29:54)
can't believe articles are still being (29:52 - 29:56)
written i guess they're easy clicks (29:54 - 29:58)
absolutely because if you want to (29:56 - 29:59)
believe that guess what link is not the (29:58 - 30:02)
main character in the next zelda game (29:59 - 30:04)
what oh yeah (30:02 - 30:06)
the dumb link wait who's been told who's (30:04 - 30:08)
link because the main character is zelda (30:06 - 30:11)
clearly (30:08 - 30:11)

greg it's better if it's got the (34:00 - 34:04)
japanese on it anyways english is a (34:01 - 34:06)
trash language (34:04 - 34:06)
they've been really uh going hard on (34:08 - 34:12)

what you just order off ebay (34:16 - 34:21)
uh is that a set (34:26 - 34:30)
apparently (34:29 - 34:32)
the these the (34:30 - 34:35)
secret art sneezler card (34:32 - 34:37)
apparently (34:35 - 34:40)
tcg player usually does odds for sets (34:37 - 34:43)
and and apparently (34:40 - 34:45)
apparently uh it's a one in two thousand (34:43 - 34:47)
chance to pull that card (34:45 - 34:48)
which makes it one of the rarest cards (34:47 - 34:50)
ever but i don't even think it's worth (34:48 - 34:51)
that much (34:50 - 34:52)
but it's a cool card because it's (34:51 - 34:54)
sneezeler and i love sneezler did you (34:52 - 34:56)
pull it (34:54 - 34:58)
heck no (34:56 - 34:58)
i've only opened (34:58 - 35:03)
um (35:00 - 35:05)
uh no i've only opened one etb and one (35:03 - 35:07)

from the pokemon center the pokemon (35:15 - 35:18)
center atv but i haven't opened it yet (35:16 - 35:19)

i would like that sneezeler (35:19 - 35:23)
i think he looks real cool (35:21 - 35:24)
uh (35:23 - 35:26)
other bit of tcg news here is there's a (35:24 - 35:29)
cleaver v-star premium collection that (35:26 - 35:31)
also launched two days ago (35:29 - 35:32)
uh (35:31 - 35:34)
i feel like we talked about this uh (35:32 - 35:37)
there's a cleaver v cleaver v star (35:34 - 35:39)
oversized cleaver v star six booster (35:37 - 35:41)
packs one pin (35:39 - 35:45)
one coin one acrylic marker and the tcg (35:41 - 35:48)
online stuff (35:45 - 35:48)
so that (35:51 - 35:54)
that that is happening (35:52 - 35:58)
if you want to spend money on that um (35:54 - 36:00)
and then finally i feel like i just said (35:58 - 36:03)
finally finally uh the tcg live (36:00 - 36:07)
limited beta is now available in mexico (36:03 - 36:08)
which i believe is news i believe that (36:07 - 36:11)
is new i bought i'm pretty sure it was (36:08 - 36:13)
only available in canada this is off (36:11 - 36:16)
pokemon.com may 24th it says it is now (36:13 - 36:18)
available in both mexico (36:16 - 36:21)
and canada (36:18 - 36:21)
and (36:21 - 36:26)
you you you could get a vpn and download (36:23 - 36:27)
it and (36:26 - 36:29)
convert your account to it and then (36:27 - 36:30)
never be able to migrate backwards (36:29 - 36:33)
because you can only migrate forward (36:30 - 36:35)
um (36:33 - 36:35)
and i i (36:35 - 36:38)
i (36:37 - 36:39)
you know i'm gonna be honest i haven't (36:38 - 36:41)
heard a lot of good things about ptcg (36:39 - 36:42)
live (36:41 - 36:43)
oh no (36:42 - 36:44)
i mean i haven't heard a lot of bad (36:43 - 36:46)
things about it either (36:44 - 36:48)
yeah i haven't heard really anything (36:46 - 36:49)
about it so (36:48 - 36:52)
i feel like i trust uh trust canadian (36:49 - 36:55)
players to you know be honest (36:52 - 36:56)
about their thoughts and feelings of a (36:55 - 36:59)
tcg client oh but canadians are too (36:56 - 37:02)
polite correct their honesty is tempered (36:59 - 37:04)
by politeness correct so it's probably (37:02 - 37:09)
10 times worse it's probably way worse (37:04 - 37:09)
i i (37:09 - 37:11)
i don't know when this is supposed to (37:12 - 37:14)
come out (37:13 - 37:16)
i'm very happy feels like we're in a (37:14 - 37:18)
weird (37:16 - 37:18)
like (37:18 - 37:22)
limbo with tcg stuff because like (37:19 - 37:24)
everybody knows this is coming but it's (37:22 - 37:26)
coming in at a very small (37:24 - 37:28)
and slow pace they're being very careful (37:26 - 37:32)
about the us release because (37:28 - 37:35)
they know that opposite of canada canada (37:32 - 37:38)
which is the united states if anything (37:35 - 37:40)
is wrong with it when it comes out into (37:38 - 37:42)
the united states we we will rip them to (37:40 - 37:43)
pieces (37:42 - 37:45)
we will tear them apart we will destroy (37:43 - 37:46)
them as a company (37:45 - 37:48)
we won't be able to play we won't be (37:46 - 37:50)
able to play blame direwolf digital this (37:48 - 37:51)
time (37:50 - 37:54)
exactly if there is one pixel out of (37:51 - 37:55)
place (37:54 - 37:58)
it's the end we're done (37:55 - 38:00)
file for bankruptcy no i think i think (37:58 - 38:02)
the nightmare is the transfer stuff (38:00 - 38:04)
because and that (38:02 - 38:08)
because once once you transfer oh boy (38:04 - 38:09)
not like (38:08 - 38:11)
the current (38:09 - 38:12)
not like pokemon (38:11 - 38:14)
tcg online is is (38:12 - 38:17)
is a wonderful app (38:14 - 38:19)
plenty of podcasts talking about how (38:17 - 38:20)
that app is (38:19 - 38:22)
not very solid but (38:20 - 38:23)
um (38:22 - 38:25)
it seems like (38:23 - 38:27)
it's to me it's this like amazing (38:25 - 38:29)
characteristic of americans which i (38:27 - 38:31)
really suspect that you don't find in (38:29 - 38:33)
that many other places in the world (38:31 - 38:34)
where you can tell (38:33 - 38:36)
you and i you know i've been a us (38:34 - 38:38)
citizen the whole time but you can tell (38:36 - 38:40)
a u.s citizen 50 times (38:38 - 38:43)
once you hit this button (38:40 - 38:44)
you can't go back (38:43 - 38:47)
once you hit this button you can't go (38:44 - 38:48)
back (38:47 - 38:51)
once you do this there's no and yet (38:48 - 38:52)
still someone will do it because they (38:51 - 38:54)
don't read they don't pay attention and (38:52 - 38:56)
then complain i'm never buying products (38:54 - 38:58)
from this company again they ripped me (38:56 - 39:00)
off because my stuff all got transferred (38:58 - 39:02)
and i can't get it back (39:00 - 39:03)
uh (39:02 - 39:04)
hey can we talk to you about (39:03 - 39:07)
wrestlemania (39:04 - 39:07)
look (39:07 - 39:13)
that's a different story (39:09 - 39:13)
is (39:13 - 39:17)
is it button pushing wrestlemania it is (39:13 - 39:19)
because (39:17 - 39:24)
if they had said in the app itself (39:19 - 39:25)
to do it (39:24 - 39:27)
it would have been done but sending me (39:25 - 39:29)
an email (39:27 - 39:31)
in the day and age when nobody reads (39:29 - 39:33)
email anymore (39:31 - 39:34)
that's a different story (39:33 - 39:36)
well there's there's going to be a point (39:34 - 39:36)
in (39:36 - 39:38)
i also did preface this by saying i've (39:36 - 39:40)
been a u.s citizen the whole time i did (39:38 - 39:44)
not extract myself from the category (39:40 - 39:44)
there will be a point where at least (39:44 - 39:50)
they said that ptcgo (39:46 - 39:52)
and will end completely (39:50 - 39:55)
and ptcgl will take over (39:52 - 39:57)
so i don't know when that is i don't (39:55 - 39:59)
know if they just if they're going to do (39:57 - 40:02)
like a beta release in the us where if (39:59 - 40:03)
you (40:02 - 40:05)
opt in early to transfer over you're (40:03 - 40:07)
you're now stuck there but like you did (40:05 - 40:09)
it and you're gonna have to do it (40:07 - 40:10)
anyways versus like (40:09 - 40:13)
we are officially releasing it now and (40:10 - 40:14)
your only option (40:13 - 40:16)
is to hit that button (40:14 - 40:20)
because we're no longer supporting ptcgo (40:16 - 40:21)
so i don't i don't know when that day is (40:20 - 40:25)
i'm assuming it's sometime this year (40:21 - 40:26)
but (40:25 - 40:28)
but let's take a break uh when we come (40:26 - 40:32)
back we got some pokemon masters news uh (40:28 - 40:34)
not really unite news but uh i have (40:32 - 40:37)
played the youtube recently the (40:34 - 40:38)
descriptions there (40:37 - 40:40)
the what is there oh this is the (40:38 - 40:42)
description unite subscriptions in yeah (40:40 - 40:44)
let's talk about that uh we'll take a (40:42 - 40:46)
break and we will be right back (40:44 - 40:50)
and we are back from our break uh there (40:46 - 40:54)
is a late may (40:50 - 40:55)
early june (40:54 - 41:00)
update to pokemon masters ex (40:55 - 41:00)
uh let's let's just talk about the (41:01 - 41:03)
character people just care about the (41:02 - 41:05)
characters right (41:03 - 41:08)
so we have uh we have uh cygnus suit (41:05 - 41:10)
ethan and lugia (41:08 - 41:13)
they are a flying type strike master (41:10 - 41:15)
sink pair (41:13 - 41:17)
um (41:15 - 41:22)
we have cigna suit lyra and celebi (41:17 - 41:25)
they are a grass type tech master sink (41:22 - 41:28)
pair (41:25 - 41:30)
and then we have signa suit chris and (41:28 - 41:31)
suicune (41:30 - 41:34)
which are a water support type master (41:31 - 41:36)
sink pair is that new jersey chris texas (41:34 - 41:39)
christo ohio chris (41:36 - 41:39)
uh that is crystal decay (41:40 - 41:44)
oh (41:42 - 41:44)
so (41:45 - 41:49)
the the word on the street (41:46 - 41:51)
is that the celebi is already (41:49 - 41:54)
overpowered (41:51 - 41:56)
because they have a passive skill (41:54 - 41:58)
they're guaranteed chance of inflicting (41:56 - 42:00)
flitching confusing and trapped (41:58 - 42:02)
uh so a hundred percent flinch well it (42:00 - 42:04)
doesn't matter on the center one because (42:02 - 42:06)
they always have a lesson skill (42:04 - 42:10)
uh to be able to flinch the sides 100 of (42:06 - 42:13)
the time is like (42:10 - 42:16)
huge for that game too much (42:13 - 42:18)
that is (42:16 - 42:18)
i think at this point like the general (42:19 - 42:23)
consensus if you're gonna only pull for (42:21 - 42:24)
one you want to try to pull the celebi (42:23 - 42:27)
because that passive skill is so (42:24 - 42:29)
powerful um that's not to say that the (42:27 - 42:33)
others aren't powerful but like (42:29 - 42:36)
the lucia is just a strike pair and they (42:33 - 42:38)
still haven't had come across anything (42:36 - 42:40)
that beats leon as the best striker in (42:38 - 42:41)
the game (42:40 - 42:45)
uh and the support pair for (42:41 - 42:47)
suicune is very good (42:45 - 42:49)
um because they have a passive skill (42:47 - 42:51)
they can raise the special events of all (42:49 - 42:53)
the pairs when rain dances up (42:51 - 42:55)
but i just don't think they've come up (42:53 - 42:57)
with something better that better than (42:55 - 42:59)
sycamore and (42:57 - 43:02)
uh xerneas because that sycamore is just (42:59 - 43:04)
incredibly overpowered too so (43:02 - 43:07)
i think the passive skill of always (43:04 - 43:09)
being able to flinch that is like if (43:07 - 43:10)
you're only gonna like i'm really gonna (43:09 - 43:12)
focus on one i would say focus on the (43:10 - 43:15)
celebi uh because it it at least on (43:12 - 43:16)
paper (43:15 - 43:18)
we'll see how it looks in game but on (43:16 - 43:20)
paper it is (43:18 - 43:22)
the most op of the three all of them are (43:20 - 43:25)
opie but that one's really opie (43:22 - 43:27)
i'm very impressed that they are still (43:25 - 43:28)
putting out (43:27 - 43:31)
seeing pairs of people that sing pairs (43:28 - 43:35)
that people care about like (43:31 - 43:35)
lyra and celebi seem really great their (43:35 - 43:39)
her outfit is really really great people (43:37 - 43:41)
like celebi a lot like chris's outfit is (43:39 - 43:44)
great people really like suicune ethan (43:41 - 43:45)
actually has a really decent outfit as (43:44 - 43:48)
well people like lugia (43:45 - 43:51)
like yeah they're recycling characters (43:48 - 43:52)
like this is the (43:51 - 43:54)
second for all of these maybe the third (43:52 - 43:57)
for lyra i think it's the third for lyra (43:54 - 43:59)
larry's got a bunch it's not it's (43:57 - 44:01)
because erica somebody loves erica in (43:59 - 44:04)
that company (44:01 - 44:05)
erica has like eight sick pairs i think (44:04 - 44:07)
misty has quite a few too (44:05 - 44:09)
uh but but because of the different (44:07 - 44:11)
pokemon choices and because of the (44:09 - 44:13)
outfits they really obviously the moves (44:11 - 44:16)
are different too and what they do um (44:13 - 44:17)
i think masters has just done a really (44:16 - 44:19)
good job but (44:17 - 44:20)
like (44:19 - 44:22)
going from i don't know what to spend my (44:20 - 44:23)
gems on to (44:22 - 44:25)
oh i'm going to spend all my gems yeah i (44:23 - 44:28)
mean they they leaned heavily into it's (44:25 - 44:30)
a collection game now like you were (44:28 - 44:31)
that's what people cares that's what (44:30 - 44:35)
people wanted yeah and i think leaning (44:31 - 44:38)
into that and sort of (44:35 - 44:40)
getting rid of or making the other stuff (44:38 - 44:42)
really optional like the game can be (44:40 - 44:44)
difficult you can do the hard stuff if (44:42 - 44:46)
you really want to do the champions path (44:44 - 44:49)
super hard stuff and maximize your (44:46 - 44:52)
seeing pairs and do all that stuff (44:49 - 44:55)
the game will support you but you do not (44:52 - 44:56)
need to do any of that to get enjoyment (44:55 - 44:58)
out of that game (44:56 - 44:59)
i think they've finally put themselves (44:58 - 45:01)
in a very solid place i think they do (44:59 - 45:03)
great stories (45:01 - 45:05)
with these characters i think they make (45:03 - 45:07)
great outfits they really capture the (45:05 - 45:10)
spirit of these people like (45:07 - 45:12)
they nailed what they did well and then (45:10 - 45:15)
leaned into it and it's made the game a (45:12 - 45:17)
hundred times better (45:15 - 45:19)
yeah it's uh for those that don't know (45:17 - 45:21)
like really early on i think like maybe (45:19 - 45:22)
a year after the game came out they sent (45:21 - 45:24)
out this huge survey (45:22 - 45:27)
and the thing that got the most votes (45:24 - 45:29)
and they talked about it in a producer (45:27 - 45:30)
letter (45:29 - 45:32)
the thing that they said that was like (45:30 - 45:34)
you guys wanted more holiday sink pairs (45:32 - 45:36)
you wanted more sink pairs in general (45:34 - 45:38)
you wanted more seasonal stuff (45:36 - 45:40)
and that's that's what people wanted and (45:38 - 45:42)
that's what they did (45:40 - 45:44)
they i agree with greg the story stuff (45:42 - 45:46)
they do is really good and it's kind of (45:44 - 45:47)
funny because you look at the story (45:46 - 45:50)
stuff they do for pokemon go and like (45:47 - 45:52)
you spend a dollar on community day for (45:50 - 45:54)
like a story like you do get the rewards (45:52 - 45:56)
but like you get technically a story to (45:54 - 46:00)
follow and it's just so (45:56 - 46:03)
sterile it's just very like (46:00 - 46:05)
but and the story still i like i still (46:03 - 46:07)
can't get over how good like the (46:05 - 46:10)
the silver storyline was oh yeah like it (46:07 - 46:12)
was really great (46:10 - 46:15)
even the storyline of morty (46:12 - 46:16)
finding (46:15 - 46:20)
and dealing with ho-oh was a really good (46:16 - 46:22)
storyline it was really good for morty (46:20 - 46:24)
as a character like the the thing that (46:22 - 46:26)
they do that just (46:24 - 46:27)
floors me is (46:26 - 46:29)
they have somebody (46:27 - 46:32)
in there that like knows these (46:29 - 46:34)
characters and knows what to do with (46:32 - 46:35)
them like (46:34 - 46:38)
the fact that they keep the lusamine and (46:35 - 46:40)
her kids stuff really tense a lot of the (46:38 - 46:42)
time and those kids are still struggling (46:40 - 46:44)
with dealing with their mom (46:42 - 46:47)
and their mom (46:44 - 46:48)
struggles with interacting with their (46:47 - 46:51)
kids but like in paizo they are working (46:48 - 46:53)
through that stuff it's just (46:51 - 46:56)
it's a joy to do their stories it's a (46:53 - 46:58)
joy to sometimes go back and reread (46:56 - 46:59)
their stories when events come around (46:58 - 47:01)
again i'm like oh yeah i'll read that (46:59 - 47:03)
story again it was fun it was cute or it (47:01 - 47:06)
was powerful like they do that so well (47:03 - 47:08)
in masters and i really wish (47:06 - 47:11)
that happened in other aspects and other (47:08 - 47:13)
games even their worst story and it (47:11 - 47:16)
wasn't even that bad but the the cyrus (47:13 - 47:18)
and rotom oh yeah and sophocles like (47:16 - 47:20)
that was probably their worst one but it (47:18 - 47:21)
was like (47:20 - 47:24)
it was still like so ridiculous that you (47:21 - 47:25)
like you remembered it because it was (47:24 - 47:27)
like well it's also because at the end (47:25 - 47:28)
like (47:27 - 47:30)
cyrus is still like (47:28 - 47:31)
i'm going to destroy the universe and (47:30 - 47:33)
everyone's like yeah but you don't want (47:31 - 47:36)
to hurt sophocles let's go boosting fair (47:33 - 47:40)
battles and everybody's like okay (47:36 - 47:40)
tetris storytelling oh yeah but they (47:41 - 47:45)
also like (47:43 - 47:47)
you know there's this hint of villainy (47:45 - 47:50)
in there like the the current team (47:47 - 47:51)
rocket (47:50 - 47:53)
uh tormenting (47:51 - 47:56)
dynamaxx that whole storyline like they (47:53 - 47:58)
are really good at making a story about (47:56 - 48:00)
bringing changes into the game (47:58 - 48:02)
uh so (48:00 - 48:04)
they just do that part really well and (48:02 - 48:08)
it it makes the game fun to play for me (48:04 - 48:09)
um and it actually makes it a game that (48:08 - 48:11)
i have now started recommending to (48:09 - 48:12)
people i'm like yeah pick up ex because (48:11 - 48:14)
it's a collection game and the stories (48:12 - 48:16)
are cute and the characterizations are (48:14 - 48:17)
cute and you do (48:16 - 48:19)
with any pair that you get you can (48:17 - 48:23)
pretty much do most of the content (48:19 - 48:23)
a time trial uh (48:24 - 48:29)
event top speed is coming on june 5th uh (48:26 - 48:31)
instead of certain sync pairs getting (48:29 - 48:32)
stat boosts when included on your team (48:31 - 48:34)
you will be able to use whichever sink (48:32 - 48:36)
pairs you would like there is no (48:34 - 48:38)
practice match for this (48:36 - 48:40)
you will be able to get gems five star (48:38 - 48:42)
guaranteed scout tickets (48:40 - 48:44)
uh (48:42 - 48:47)
rivals from each sink (48:44 - 48:49)
rivals from each region are assembling (48:47 - 48:52)
that will be the story event rivalry on (48:49 - 48:53)
june 15th (48:52 - 48:56)
then that's all they really say (48:53 - 48:56)
um (48:56 - 48:59)
maybe we get hugh finally i don't know (48:56 - 49:01)
maybe (48:59 - 49:03)

knows what's up but he'd have to have (50:28 - 50:32)
you but he would have to have a sink a (50:30 - 50:34)
new thinker it couldn't be a palpato (50:32 - 50:35)

don't serve any purpose (51:29 - 51:33)
they could have like uh you know like uh (51:31 - 51:34)
egg cup or something where you can only (51:33 - 51:36)

play pokemon masters i played that like (52:23 - 52:27)
every day i was like oh (52:25 - 52:30)
steve is playing unite i'll jump in and (52:27 - 52:32)
maybe we'll do how do you have a psychic (52:30 - 52:34)
power to tell when steve is playing (52:32 - 52:38)
unite because it shows in my stupid list (52:34 - 52:40)
on your switch (52:38 - 52:42)
on the switch yeah oh you know i have (52:40 - 52:44)
all that turned off so i never see who's (52:42 - 52:47)
online or whatever but then i realized (52:44 - 52:49)
that you're (52:47 - 52:51)
so far below me (52:49 - 52:53)
that i could yeah (52:51 - 52:55)
i couldn't connect with you to even try (52:53 - 52:58)
to help your terrible gameplay my (52:55 - 52:59)
gameplay is actually really good what (52:58 - 53:00)
are you talking about (52:59 - 53:03)
oh where are you in the ranking (53:00 - 53:05)
uh so the first thing is unite (53:03 - 53:07)
acknowledged that i haven't played they (53:05 - 53:09)
said you haven't logged in in 70 days (53:07 - 53:11)
and they said if you play a match right (53:09 - 53:14)
now we will give you 4 000 coins which (53:11 - 53:16)
is a a lot of coins yeah they yeah they (53:14 - 53:17)
did that to me too you just have to play (53:16 - 53:18)
not win (53:17 - 53:20)
no you didn't have to play yeah and they (53:18 - 53:22)
gave me a bot match and i actually lost (53:20 - 53:24)
the bot (53:22 - 53:25)
they i feel like they made the bots (53:24 - 53:28)
better not like much better the bots are (53:25 - 53:31)
much better well okay asterix depending (53:28 - 53:33)
on where you are in the rankings the (53:31 - 53:37)
bots are better yeah it did feel like um (53:33 - 53:40)
it felt like oh here let me let me let (53:37 - 53:41)
me change this it felt like the (53:40 - 53:45)
opponent's bots were were in oh yeah (53:41 - 53:47)
yeah it felt like my team (53:45 - 53:49)
you know what the heck they were doing (53:47 - 53:51)
hot garbage (53:49 - 53:53)
and there's still no way it's kind of (53:51 - 53:55)
weird there's like still no way so they (53:53 - 53:57)
have the gather here like command (53:55 - 53:59)
you would think that the bots would (53:57 - 54:01)
react to the gathering yeah but they (53:59 - 54:02)
don't just like they don't just like (54:01 - 54:04)
korea players they don't they don't well (54:02 - 54:06)
the problem is that they programmed the (54:04 - 54:08)
gather here command in english and the (54:06 - 54:11)
bots only speak japanese oh that means (54:08 - 54:14)
yeah i don't understand (54:11 - 54:16)
also they're wondering why you're going (54:14 - 54:18)
to dreadna nobody goes to dreadnough (54:16 - 54:19)
well it's weird because the two bots on (54:18 - 54:21)
the bottom never went to dreadnough but (54:19 - 54:24)
the two bots on top always went to (54:21 - 54:25)
rotate (54:24 - 54:27)
so like the weird thing is if you are (54:25 - 54:30)
playing solo match like (54:27 - 54:31)
at this point if you're playing by (54:30 - 54:35)
yourself just go to rotom (54:31 - 54:37)
and just do rotom because (54:35 - 54:38)
unless you're with somebody else (54:37 - 54:40)
nobody's going to go down to jordan it's (54:38 - 54:41)
a super frustrating thing that's (54:40 - 54:45)
happening right now that people think (54:41 - 54:46)
people (54:45 - 54:50)
do road time because it forces people to (54:46 - 54:53)
like give up objectives to stop rotom (54:50 - 54:55)
which is like just let rotom happen (54:53 - 54:56)
because (54:55 - 54:59)
it's 20 points to compare to getting (54:56 - 55:01)
like a level and a half down at the (54:59 - 55:03)
bottom there are still frustrating (55:01 - 55:05)
things about uh masters but you are in (55:03 - 55:06)
what rank (55:05 - 55:09)
and unite what what uh i think i i think (55:06 - 55:10)
because (55:09 - 55:13)
how many seasons have happened (55:10 - 55:15)
dude i got a i got a season payout and (55:13 - 55:17)
it was like i i think i got season (55:15 - 55:20)
payout because i think i ended in ultra (55:17 - 55:22)
and then when you log back in you're in (55:20 - 55:23)
veteran but then i didn't play any at (55:22 - 55:26)
veteran so then it put me in whatever (55:23 - 55:28)
expert yeah yeah yeah (55:26 - 55:31)
you're too low for me to help yeah (55:28 - 55:33)
um but i still got the rewards for not (55:31 - 55:35)
playing which was like cool (55:33 - 55:37)
um what i want to talk about is the uh (55:35 - 55:38)
membership (55:37 - 55:39)
because (55:38 - 55:41)
let's briefly talk about what's (55:39 - 55:43)
happening on the 30th (55:41 - 55:45)
oh the new exciting gameplay that it is (55:43 - 55:47)
everybody's excited for (55:45 - 55:49)
i'm excited i can't tell that's sarcasm (55:47 - 55:52)
or not because i'm like okay (55:49 - 55:53)
i'm so interested to see how this is (55:52 - 55:58)
gonna work like it looks super fun (55:53 - 56:00)
yeah it's it's not on their website i (55:58 - 56:01)
don't know where they announced this i (56:00 - 56:02)
think they just announced that on (56:01 - 56:05)
twitter it's not on twitter it's not on (56:02 - 56:08)
um pokemon unite.pokemon.com the last (56:05 - 56:11)
news article is is the um (56:08 - 56:12)
the (56:11 - 56:13)
membership (56:12 - 56:15)
but pretty much it's a new game mode (56:13 - 56:18)
where if you uh defeat a pokemon you (56:15 - 56:20)
turn into that pokemon so if you (56:18 - 56:23)
definitely can turn into that pokemon (56:20 - 56:26)
it is a is it is the option to swap into (56:23 - 56:28)
that pokemon for a limited time you're (56:26 - 56:31)
like catching it right if if you knock (56:28 - 56:34)
out the ludacola you're now the you can (56:31 - 56:36)
be the luducolo and you would have (56:34 - 56:37)
ludacola's moves (56:36 - 56:39)
and then they showed like (56:37 - 56:42)
somebody was the zapdos (56:39 - 56:44)
yeah so they're also adding in (56:42 - 56:46)
articuno (56:44 - 56:48)
they're adding in (56:46 - 56:50)
a bunch of different ones that you can (56:48 - 56:52)
swap into and it does seem to be like a (56:50 - 56:54)
limited amount of time the joke is of (56:52 - 56:57)
course go to dreadnought because if you (56:54 - 56:59)
get if you capture dreadnought then you (56:57 - 57:00)
can turn into dread now (56:59 - 57:01)
so maybe you'll finally go down to (57:00 - 57:03)
dreadnough (57:01 - 57:04)
um (57:03 - 57:07)
but yeah so 5 30 onward is going to be (57:04 - 57:10)
a game mode option we don't know if it's (57:07 - 57:13)
going to be a temporary game mode option (57:10 - 57:14)
like full (57:13 - 57:17)
full i think crazy modes do benefit from (57:14 - 57:18)
being temporary because it forces people (57:17 - 57:20)
to be like oh it's only here for a week (57:18 - 57:22)
and then like when it comes back then (57:20 - 57:23)
people get excited again yeah (57:22 - 57:25)
full-fledged battles lasted for a couple (57:23 - 57:26)
weeks so i imagine this will be like (57:25 - 57:28)
that too it looks (57:26 - 57:29)
i mean i'm kind of excited for it just (57:28 - 57:32)
to see how (57:29 - 57:34)
how the how they implement those (57:32 - 57:37)
big creatures how easy it is to switch (57:34 - 57:38)
i'm like (57:37 - 57:41)
there's a new level of (57:38 - 57:42)
strategy added to it since it's a (57:41 - 57:46)
temporary change like when's the ideal (57:42 - 57:47)
time to (57:46 - 57:48)
to swap (57:47 - 57:50)
in (57:48 - 57:52)
and and and be the more powerful pokemon (57:50 - 57:54)
i'm i'm really excited for it and it's (57:52 - 57:56)
coming tomorrow so (57:54 - 57:58)
yeah and we always talk about how like (57:56 - 57:59)
what would get people to come back to (57:58 - 58:00)
unite (57:59 - 58:02)
and they did their like chris they did (58:00 - 58:03)
the first they did the halloween thing (58:02 - 58:05)
with the pumpkins and then the the (58:03 - 58:07)
christmas one was like pretty similar to (58:05 - 58:09)
it like a little different yeah um and (58:07 - 58:11)
then they did the all out which i think (58:09 - 58:12)
people i didn't get a chance to play (58:11 - 58:14)
that but i think people really liked the (58:12 - 58:17)
all fall out was (58:14 - 58:17)
brilliant but also hard it was hard to (58:17 - 58:22)
do because you it was such a different (58:20 - 58:24)
mindset of oh you always have your moves (58:22 - 58:26)
available always yeah (58:24 - 58:29)
uh and so that was sort of hard to and (58:26 - 58:32)
and certain just certain pokemons (58:29 - 58:35)
they're better in that yeah environment (58:32 - 58:38)
so it quickly became like only used like (58:35 - 58:40)
only use sylveon only use (58:38 - 58:43)
ludicr lucario only use these because (58:40 - 58:45)
their moves come up so fast it it just (58:43 - 58:48)
makes more sense to use them but i i saw (58:45 - 58:49)
the general consensus of people being (58:48 - 58:51)
like oh this looks really cool yeah it (58:49 - 58:54)
was very fun and and this (58:51 - 58:56)
uh uh new ketchum battles looks (58:54 - 58:58)
incredibly fun i hope it's as fun as it (58:56 - 59:01)
looks (58:58 - 59:01)
what's not fun is their membership (59:01 - 59:06)
yeah i'm not about the subscription the (59:03 - 59:09)
description so uh (59:06 - 59:12)
this is uh you can gain eos gems hollow (59:09 - 59:14)
wear and special bonuses with pokemon (59:12 - 59:17)

blue tier hoopa themed trainer fashion (60:11 - 60:17)
item and two limited license (60:13 - 60:17)
um so (60:18 - 60:26)
the good i guess is 1200 eos gems yeah (60:21 - 60:29)
is normally 20 dollars (60:26 - 60:31)
so you're getting it for ten (60:29 - 60:33)
nowhere did i (60:31 - 60:35)
figure out nowhere in the long terms and (60:33 - 60:37)
conditions that i literally read on (60:35 - 60:39)
stream does it say you need to log in to (60:37 - 60:42)
receive these forty gems so i don't (60:39 - 60:44)
actually know is if you (60:42 - 60:46)
miss a week do you (60:44 - 60:49)
get seven times 40 or i don't know (60:46 - 60:51)
anybody who has done it (60:49 - 60:53)
so i i don't know (60:51 - 60:55)
and the thing is is the people that i've (60:53 - 60:56)
seen (60:55 - 60:59)
who have the special chat bubble (60:56 - 61:01)
are people that i see playing the game (60:59 - 61:02)
like i recognize their name because i (61:01 - 61:04)
play almost daily now (61:02 - 61:07)
and i recognize their names a lot so i (61:04 - 61:09)
don't know if there's anybody who bought (61:07 - 61:11)
it and then has gone (61:09 - 61:13)
away but again (61:11 - 61:15)
i don't think it's worth it (61:13 - 61:17)
if you aren't logging in every day to (61:15 - 61:19)
try to get the most out of it anyways (61:17 - 61:21)
well what first what are the aos gems (61:19 - 61:23)
what can you buy with those because you (61:21 - 61:24)
know there's some things you can buy and (61:23 - 61:26)
some things you can't buy as gems you (61:24 - 61:27)
can buy (61:26 - 61:30)
licenses with you can buy certain hollow (61:27 - 61:31)
wear with (61:30 - 61:34)
you can buy (61:31 - 61:36)
certain items of clothing like clothing (61:34 - 61:39)
sets like as gems (61:36 - 61:42)
uh also you can spend eos gems to get (61:39 - 61:44)
item enhancers to increase your items (61:42 - 61:46)
um (61:44 - 61:48)
but mainly is to get (61:46 - 61:51)
is to easily get unite licenses so you (61:48 - 61:53)
can get characters skins and you can (61:51 - 61:56)
power up the held items yep (61:53 - 61:58)
i think the the the one thing so with (61:56 - 62:00)
with unite license though you can either (61:58 - 62:03)
do eos gems or coins (62:00 - 62:06)
right and coins it's usually anywhere (62:03 - 62:08)
between eight thousand to ten thousand (62:06 - 62:10)
coins yep and i just said i get i they (62:08 - 62:12)
gave me four thousand coins for not (62:10 - 62:14)
logging in for two months which is (62:12 - 62:15)
half a character (62:14 - 62:18)
ultimately i mean i don't i i personally (62:15 - 62:19)
don't think coins are that hard to get (62:18 - 62:21)
coins is going to be easier currency (62:19 - 62:25)
than gems i'm sitting on (62:21 - 62:25)
27 000 coins right now (62:26 - 62:30)
and i i don't pay any money the other (62:29 - 62:33)
thing that eos gems buy you are the (62:30 - 62:36)
battle passes and so if you like battle (62:33 - 62:38)
passes if you like the special (62:36 - 62:41)
halloween that only comes in the battle (62:38 - 62:44)
path you could only buy battle passes (62:41 - 62:46)
with aos gems so 500 (62:44 - 62:50)
worth it if you are going to be like if (62:46 - 62:53)
pokemon unite is your main game you like (62:50 - 62:56)
like for me i always go back to this but (62:53 - 62:57)
like right i play monster hunter every (62:56 - 62:59)
day i want to play monster hunter every (62:57 - 63:01)
day it is the game that i love to play (62:59 - 63:04)
every day if unite is that for you then (63:01 - 63:05)
this subscription (63:04 - 63:07)
might be a good deal (63:05 - 63:09)
um (63:07 - 63:09)
yes because (63:10 - 63:14)
you you would need to use you can only (63:12 - 63:16)
use ao's gems to buy the battle pass so (63:14 - 63:19)
assuming you're playing every day (63:16 - 63:20)
you're getting (63:19 - 63:22)
pretty much (63:20 - 63:24)
you're paying ten dollars for two months (63:22 - 63:25)
of battle pass (63:24 - 63:28)
yeah like i said you can do coins or (63:25 - 63:32)
gems for characters yeah but for skins (63:28 - 63:34)
character skins (63:32 - 63:37)
pokemon skins those are only gems (63:34 - 63:39)
sometimes they're specific like skip (63:37 - 63:41)
tickets that you get from loot boxes but (63:39 - 63:45)
like the 40 nine tails skin right right (63:41 - 63:47)
that we we always talk about that is (63:45 - 63:49)
only gems right um the forty dollar (63:47 - 63:51)
machamp skin the thirty five dollar (63:49 - 63:54)
cramaran skin a lot of the outfits are (63:51 - 63:58)
only gems whereas like characters (63:54 - 63:59)
unlocking new pokemon can be done with (63:58 - 64:02)
coins you can't buy the 40 nine tails (63:59 - 64:04)
skin with coins (64:02 - 64:05)
um (64:04 - 64:08)
i think that it it's almost like it's so (64:05 - 64:11)
close to being worth it for somebody who (64:08 - 64:13)
maybe logs in like twice a week or even (64:11 - 64:15)
once a week because (64:13 - 64:17)
if you are getting all the gems at the (64:15 - 64:19)
end no matter what that's then yeah you (64:17 - 64:21)
could say it's worth it i i might as (64:19 - 64:23)
well just buy it tonight just to see if (64:21 - 64:25)
i don't log in if i get the gems um just (64:23 - 64:28)
to literally test (64:25 - 64:29)
because i haven't found anywhere online (64:28 - 64:31)
that that is the thing that like it's (64:29 - 64:32)
just (64:31 - 64:36)
zero appeal at all is is like renting (64:32 - 64:39)
characters yeah and not only that like i (64:36 - 64:41)
could understand like oh i'm not sure if (64:39 - 64:42)
i want to get trevident i can rent (64:41 - 64:45)
private cool cause (64:42 - 64:47)
yeah like i think i i (64:45 - 64:49)
i have like 80 000 coins so i i could (64:47 - 64:51)
buy quite a few characters but for me i (64:49 - 64:53)
i just like playing cramer and i know (64:51 - 64:55)
cramer's not the best character but like (64:53 - 64:56)
because it happens to be my favorite (64:55 - 64:57)
pokemon and because i have like the (64:56 - 64:59)
skins for him i just really like playing (64:57 - 65:02)
cramer ant and like i do like blastoise (64:59 - 65:04)
i do like venusaur (65:02 - 65:06)
so like i have a good three like there's (65:04 - 65:08)
never a situation where somebody in the (65:06 - 65:10)
united is like oh cramer and second oh (65:08 - 65:13)
blast always taken oh venus like i get (65:10 - 65:16)
one of the three it's fine (65:13 - 65:17)
and (65:16 - 65:19)
and i do want to try trevident yeah (65:17 - 65:22)
treven is great i will say (65:19 - 65:24)
to rent a character and then to rent a (65:22 - 65:28)
skin as like a bonus just like it's (65:24 - 65:30)
who's like who's paying ten dollars (65:28 - 65:34)
i might want to it just seems silly how (65:30 - 65:35)
many (65:34 - 65:38)
how many pokemon are in the game now 35 (65:35 - 65:39)
35 so (65:38 - 65:41)
let's say they get to a point where (65:39 - 65:44)
there's 500 pokemon in the game (65:41 - 65:49)
then our rental is worth it for you um (65:44 - 65:49)
yeah maybe but like it's hard because if (65:49 - 65:53)
you're going into right i'm assuming if (65:52 - 65:55)
you're playing every day you're probably (65:53 - 65:56)
playing ranked and you're (65:55 - 65:58)
probably never going to go into ranked (65:56 - 65:59)
with a character you've never played (65:58 - 66:02)
what happens oh you would be surprised (65:59 - 66:04)
yeah also when the meta shifts you're (66:02 - 66:05)
gonna have to play a new character i (66:04 - 66:07)
mean (66:05 - 66:07)
there's not a lot (66:08 - 66:12)
so right now there's not a lot of (66:10 - 66:14)
variation between the various (66:12 - 66:16)
characters and how they play (66:14 - 66:18)
so (66:16 - 66:21)
at most you're going to pick a pokemon (66:18 - 66:23)
that you like (66:21 - 66:24)
and and renting one (66:23 - 66:27)
to test it out they don't their moves (66:24 - 66:29)
aren't so different than what you've (66:27 - 66:30)
played before that i think renting it (66:29 - 66:33)
for a while is going to make or break (66:30 - 66:35)
whether you wanted to buy that character (66:33 - 66:36)
because they really like all the (66:35 - 66:38)
attackers all the ranged attackers (66:36 - 66:41)
really really played the same right now (66:38 - 66:42)
um that's why hoopa was a big deal (66:41 - 66:45)
because like just different very very (66:42 - 66:47)
different and espeon's a little bit (66:45 - 66:49)
different but not i don't think enough (66:47 - 66:51)
that that you'd be like i've never (66:49 - 66:53)
played this character type before (66:51 - 66:54)
um (66:53 - 66:56)
so i think it's (66:54 - 66:57)
i think (66:56 - 67:00)
given the state of how (66:57 - 67:02)
similar a lot of the characters are (67:00 - 67:03)
rents (67:02 - 67:05)
rentals don't make a lot of sense that (67:03 - 67:08)
could absolutely change in the future (67:05 - 67:10)
if they come up with more (67:08 - 67:13)
play styles or or different (67:10 - 67:15)
like a characters that play completely (67:13 - 67:17)
different than what exists currently (67:15 - 67:19)
then i can see renting it to see but the (67:17 - 67:21)
thing is (67:19 - 67:22)
you can pick any character that you (67:21 - 67:24)
don't have and practice with it and go (67:22 - 67:26)
into the practice it's the one one (67:24 - 67:28)
versus one but you can still get the (67:26 - 67:32)
feel of how the moves go so (67:28 - 67:32)
renting in that in the current situation (67:32 - 67:38)
just doesn't make a whole lot of sense (67:35 - 67:40)
there's just not (67:38 - 67:42)
it's not a big enough draw for me to say (67:40 - 67:45)
people would pay a subscription to get (67:42 - 67:47)
rental licenses i think i think will (67:45 - 67:49)
makes a great point if there's like 100 (67:47 - 67:52)
characters and you get to rent two a (67:49 - 67:53)
week or whatever i don't even (67:52 - 67:54)
whatever (67:53 - 67:56)
uh (67:54 - 67:58)
i i get it because that's a lot of (67:56 - 68:00)
characters and you you will probably run (67:58 - 68:03)
out of coins or be very weary to spend (68:00 - 68:07)
your coins the like renting outfits (68:03 - 68:09)
right now if it's makes no sense skins (68:07 - 68:11)
get wins (68:09 - 68:12)
period (68:11 - 68:15)
you know for every 40 nine tails that (68:12 - 68:16)
has joined my game i really thought they (68:15 - 68:18)
would carry hard but they (68:16 - 68:19)
don't (68:18 - 68:22)
uh the thing is i would say if you're (68:19 - 68:24)
already spending money (68:22 - 68:26)
on a regular basis in unite the (68:24 - 68:28)
subscription makes sense (68:26 - 68:30)
if you aren't (68:28 - 68:32)
regularly spending money (68:30 - 68:35)
if if you don't buy every battle pass if (68:32 - 68:37)
you don't if you look at battle passes (68:35 - 68:39)
think i don't (68:37 - 68:40)
not like the current one nothing in (68:39 - 68:42)
there interests me so i didn't buy it so (68:40 - 68:45)
the subscription doesn't make a whole (68:42 - 68:47)
lot of sense for me because i just don't (68:45 - 68:49)
even though i'm getting a discount i (68:47 - 68:51)
don't spend money in that game right now (68:49 - 68:54)
well yeah even i looked at the store i (68:51 - 68:55)
was like i haven't been in the store for (68:54 - 68:57)
70 days right like the game told me i (68:55 - 68:58)
haven't been here for seven days i (68:57 - 69:00)
looked at the store and i was like okay (68:58 - 69:02)
so i get 10 off (69:00 - 69:04)
new stuff (69:02 - 69:06)
there's there's like three things that (69:04 - 69:08)
are new yeah like and you only get the (69:06 - 69:10)
ten percent off for like the first what (69:08 - 69:12)
would they say seven days ten first (69:10 - 69:15)
seven days seven or and it's like a week (69:12 - 69:18)
i i i don't care about espeon right now (69:15 - 69:21)
to buy that espeon outfit i don't care (69:18 - 69:21)
about (69:21 - 69:23)
i can't i don't even remember the other (69:21 - 69:24)
two outfits that's like because like i (69:23 - 69:26)
was like i don't play these characters (69:24 - 69:26)
why (69:26 - 69:28)
like (69:26 - 69:29)
it (69:28 - 69:30)
i (69:29 - 69:32)
i understand like a 10 off discount (69:30 - 69:35)
because you are a member but you're ten (69:32 - 69:38)
percenting off (69:35 - 69:41)
uh like not enough things that are so (69:38 - 69:45)
specific to like pokemon like i don't (69:41 - 69:48)
have absol unlocked cool absol had a new (69:45 - 69:49)
outfit (69:48 - 69:52)
if i wanted now you can rent seoul and (69:49 - 69:53)
get the outfit (69:52 - 69:55)
here's the thing there there was um a (69:53 - 69:57)
blissey outfit right this was i think (69:55 - 69:58)
around (69:57 - 70:01)
maybe valentine's day and the blissey (69:58 - 70:03)
outfit was on like sale i i maybe i (70:01 - 70:04)
misremember the pokemon the point still (70:03 - 70:06)
stands the blissey outfit was like (70:04 - 70:09)
three-day sale for like 50 gems (70:06 - 70:10)
and i was like wow i really like this (70:09 - 70:13)
outfit i don't have blissey but whatever (70:10 - 70:14)
it's 50 gems it's three days i'm just (70:13 - 70:16)
gonna buy it (70:14 - 70:19)
it doesn't let you buy it without buying (70:16 - 70:21)
the character (70:19 - 70:23)
so even if i was like oh i get 10 off (70:21 - 70:25)
this brand new espeon skin (70:23 - 70:27)
s band's a bad example because you can (70:25 - 70:28)
technically get s banned for free but i (70:27 - 70:30)
like spam for free but yeah but let's (70:28 - 70:32)
say you let's say they weren't off let's (70:30 - 70:33)
say espn's the new character not (70:32 - 70:34)
offering it for free (70:33 - 70:38)
oh cool the espeon outfit is 50 off this (70:34 - 70:40)
week plus i get my 10 off (70:38 - 70:43)
i'll just buy it i'll get espeon later (70:40 - 70:45)
it it doesn't let you have to (70:43 - 70:48)
spend either gems or 10 000 coins (70:45 - 70:50)
again espn's a bad example because you (70:48 - 70:51)
can't buy a spam with coins right now (70:50 - 70:53)
but you will um (70:51 - 70:56)
to get it like i if i wanted i had to (70:53 - 70:57)
buy blissey at that point because i was (70:56 - 70:59)
like well i guess (70:57 - 71:03)
i i i want the little skin it's on sale (70:59 - 71:06)
it's it's (71:03 - 71:06)
i feel like if any game should have a (71:06 - 71:10)
subscription right now it should be (71:09 - 71:12)
pokemon go because it's been out for (71:10 - 71:14)
five years don't say that don't put (71:12 - 71:16)
those ideas in their head (71:14 - 71:18)
like this subscription would probably (71:16 - 71:19)
make more sense if there was more (71:18 - 71:21)
characters if there was more skins if (71:19 - 71:23)
they like it was shocking to me to come (71:21 - 71:25)
back to the game after 70 days and be (71:23 - 71:26)
like (71:25 - 71:29)
oh there's nothing new in the store well (71:26 - 71:31)
it may be that if people take up the (71:29 - 71:33)
subscription that they (71:31 - 71:35)
start to accelerate adding characters (71:33 - 71:38)
and skins i mean to also to also go (71:35 - 71:41)
against that you miss battle passes (71:38 - 71:45)
right like one of the big thing for (71:41 - 71:47)
your gems are the battle passes so you (71:45 - 71:49)
didn't do the frontier battle pass you (71:47 - 71:51)
didn't do the theater battle pass those (71:49 - 71:53)
had unique skins (71:51 - 71:55)
uh they had unique outfits so (71:53 - 71:58)
there's nothing in the store but (71:55 - 72:00)
also you didn't do battle passes like (71:58 - 72:01)
you missed (72:00 - 72:03)
and if you don't play for another 70 (72:01 - 72:05)
days you'll miss the existing battle (72:03 - 72:06)
pass should they have something that you (72:05 - 72:07)
like (72:06 - 72:10)
so this tempers half of the store like (72:07 - 72:13)
the other bone the other bonuses other (72:10 - 72:15)
than the discount of (72:13 - 72:18)
the gems are like okay (72:15 - 72:20)
they're nice to have but they're not the (72:18 - 72:22)
reason that you'd ever want to go for (72:20 - 72:23)
that subscription because they're mostly (72:22 - 72:24)
useless (72:23 - 72:26)
um what you're really there is you're (72:24 - 72:28)
gonna pay (72:26 - 72:30)
to get cheap gems to purchase what you (72:28 - 72:33)
want in the game yeah and if you aren't (72:30 - 72:36)
regularly purchasing every battle pass (72:33 - 72:40)
then i do not think at this time (72:36 - 72:40)
there's enough in the subscription to (72:41 - 72:45)
make the subscription worse you know (72:43 - 72:47)
what would get me to (72:45 - 72:48)
like pull the trigger on it without (72:47 - 72:49)
thinking (72:48 - 72:53)
is like a 20 like xp boost on the battle (72:49 - 72:55)
pass (72:53 - 72:57)
if it was like here's your 1200 gems (72:55 - 72:59)
here's your 10 a month (72:57 - 73:01)
here's your 10 off discount of new (72:59 - 73:03)
things but also instead of this like (73:01 - 73:07)
renting costumes or renting even pokemon (73:03 - 73:08)
i would like to just (73:07 - 73:10)
i would be incentivized to buy the (73:08 - 73:12)
battle pass if i could level it up (73:10 - 73:15)
quicker because i don't get to play (73:12 - 73:17)
every day so if it was like (73:15 - 73:18)
normally it's okay (73:17 - 73:20)
three weeks to do a battle pass if (73:18 - 73:22)
you're telling me i could do it in (73:20 - 73:24)
two weeks that that to me is appealing (73:22 - 73:26)
to be (73:24 - 73:27)
fair (73:26 - 73:29)
if you rent a pokemon (73:27 - 73:31)
that you've never played before you do (73:29 - 73:34)
get a boost to your xp to your battle (73:31 - 73:36)
points by using that character that (73:34 - 73:38)
you've never used for a while you do (73:36 - 73:40)
yeah because y'all the ones that you've (73:38 - 73:41)
purchased and haven't played have that (73:40 - 73:43)
little up up arrow saying if you play (73:41 - 73:46)
these characters you get a bonus to your (73:43 - 73:48)
bp to your battle points so there is a (73:46 - 73:51)
there is a reason to try other ones if (73:48 - 73:53)
you're looking to build up your battle (73:51 - 73:56)
points the problem is is that (73:53 - 73:59)
battle points don't do a lot either (73:56 - 74:03)
like that system is there (73:59 - 74:05)
to maybe get some rewards (74:03 - 74:08)
but the rewards that they give aren't (74:05 - 74:10)
really that game changing but i mean you (74:08 - 74:13)
can rent a license get the bonus to your (74:10 - 74:15)
bp for a little for (74:13 - 74:17)
i forget how it's not a ton of matches i (74:15 - 74:19)
think once you've completed five matches (74:17 - 74:20)
with (74:19 - 74:21)
that (74:20 - 74:22)
character (74:21 - 74:23)
that goes away (74:22 - 74:26)
it's a it's a limited time but that that (74:23 - 74:30)
is sort of in the game (74:26 - 74:30)
yeah and i know you can spend like the (74:30 - 74:34)
extra like 500 gems to get like the free (74:32 - 74:37)
15 levels or whatever but like yeah but (74:34 - 74:40)
if you're playing every day like i'm i'm (74:37 - 74:41)
all the way through the current battle (74:40 - 74:44)
pass it's still got (74:41 - 74:47)
30 days left on it and i know the new (74:44 - 74:49)
battle pass and the current battle pass (74:47 - 74:50)
ends in like seven days because when i (74:49 - 74:52)
logged in there was like 11 days left (74:50 - 74:54)
and i was like oh yeah i'm thinking i (74:52 - 74:55)
haven't started this battle past there's (74:54 - 74:57)
11 days left why would i buy there's no (74:55 - 74:59)
way i can finish it i'm thinking of the (74:57 - 75:02)
getting the sbn when this still got like (74:59 - 75:03)
yeah the spf one still has like 11 days (75:02 - 75:06)
but yeah like i've alrea i was already (75:03 - 75:09)
through that by playing every day (75:06 - 75:11)
and so if i decided like i really wanted (75:09 - 75:13)
the blastoise (75:11 - 75:15)
outfit like i could just buy it and have (75:13 - 75:17)
the entire thing completed but (75:15 - 75:19)
um it's not hard to complete the battle (75:17 - 75:21)
passes if you're playing every day yeah (75:19 - 75:23)
but if you're probably playing twice a (75:21 - 75:25)
week right and i'm hesitant to buy the (75:23 - 75:26)
battle pass (75:25 - 75:29)
but i'm i want to buy the battle pass (75:26 - 75:30)
and then it's like well this doesn't (75:29 - 75:32)
seem worth it to me but like i like the (75:30 - 75:34)
gems because the gems is a big deal it's (75:32 - 75:36)
like nothing else in here (75:34 - 75:39)
seems great for somebody who isn't (75:36 - 75:41)
logging in every day and that (75:39 - 75:43)
it isn't (75:41 - 75:45)
like even even me i log in every day and (75:43 - 75:47)
i'm not doing the subscription (75:45 - 75:49)
like there is i (75:47 - 75:51)
i there's nothing that i feel like i (75:49 - 75:54)
would spend gems on (75:51 - 75:54)
that that would be worth getting this (75:54 - 75:58)
discount because i may like the next (75:56 - 76:01)
battle pass then i'll just pay (75:58 - 76:04)
the one time access to get that (76:01 - 76:05)
and be done (76:04 - 76:07)
yeah because i don't know that i want (76:05 - 76:09)
the next battle pass i don't know that (76:07 - 76:10)
like (76:09 - 76:12)
there's nothing in the completionist in (76:10 - 76:13)
me that says i have to have every battle (76:12 - 76:16)
pass and i have access to every outfit (76:13 - 76:21)
that is just not how i play this game (76:16 - 76:21)
yeah um (76:22 - 76:26)
i think unite is cool i really do like (76:24 - 76:28)
unite i do have a fun time playing it it (76:26 - 76:30)
is it is it is (76:28 - 76:31)
like (76:30 - 76:33)
most competitive things as somebody (76:31 - 76:35)
who's done a lot of competitive tcg a (76:33 - 76:37)
lot of competitive vgc it is it is an (76:35 - 76:39)
amazing it's amazingly fun when you're (76:37 - 76:43)
winning it is amazing amazing (76:39 - 76:46)
um spoiler alert or alert alert uh (76:43 - 76:48)
they've added a (76:46 - 76:50)
voice chat to the game (76:48 - 76:52)
that uh (76:50 - 76:53)
is (76:52 - 76:54)
on (76:53 - 76:56)
you can hear so if you don't turn that (76:54 - 76:59)
off you may hear somebody (76:56 - 77:00)
call you the worst player they've ever (76:59 - 77:01)
seen (77:00 - 77:03)
because they don't know you know (77:01 - 77:06)
uh and you forgot to turn off the oh i (77:03 - 77:07)
turned that off day one because they had (77:06 - 77:09)
that option day one it just didn't work (77:07 - 77:12)
yeah i sometimes forget to turn it off (77:09 - 77:14)
uh and have heard things like excuse me (77:12 - 77:15)
you didn't rotate the red dot but i (77:14 - 77:17)
didn't have the microphone on so i (77:15 - 77:20)
couldn't yell back at them (77:17 - 77:20)
um yeah a united school (77:20 - 77:25)
uh (77:23 - 77:25)
it's it's it's it's definitely a moba (77:28 - 77:31)
that's true i will i will say this for (77:30 - 77:34)
as frustrating as i find it i found a (77:31 - 77:36)
pretty dedicated group of people who (77:34 - 77:38)
play it on a fairly regular basis which (77:36 - 77:42)
makes it way more fun oh i'm sure yeah (77:38 - 77:43)
you know we have our own little discord (77:42 - 77:45)
and we say who's who's up for playing (77:43 - 77:46)
some matches because (77:45 - 77:49)
uh even pairing with another person that (77:46 - 77:52)
you sort of have (77:49 - 77:54)
an understanding of how they play and (77:52 - 77:55)
how you play and you both have (77:54 - 77:57)
understanding of of your objectives in (77:55 - 77:59)
the games makes that game (77:57 - 78:01)
way more fun and you can (77:59 - 78:03)
i mean (78:01 - 78:05)
i i play i i'm not kidding i do play it (78:03 - 78:07)
almost every day so (78:05 - 78:09)
like (78:07 - 78:11)
having people play with you on a regular (78:09 - 78:15)
basis is a much better experience (78:11 - 78:15)
question of (78:16 - 78:20)
the week (78:18 - 78:22)
so if you want to hear the question of (78:20 - 78:27)
the week oh ho here it comes our way (78:22 - 78:27)
oh you know what we didn't talk about (78:30 - 78:35)
sorry chris posted it in our uh (78:32 - 78:37)
in our attic channel that the uh pokken (78:35 - 78:40)
tournament speaking of that (78:37 - 78:42)
i was gonna say you know i i did match (78:40 - 78:43)
with a lot of similar players when i (78:42 - 78:44)
played unite and i kind of wish there (78:43 - 78:47)
was more players playing unite (78:44 - 78:48)
um (78:47 - 78:48)
but (78:48 - 78:50)
there is no one playing pokken (78:48 - 78:52)
tournament dx anymore no (78:50 - 78:55)
so this will be the last year pokken (78:52 - 78:56)
tournament dx will be featured in the (78:55 - 78:58)
play (78:56 - 79:00)
pokemon program (78:58 - 79:04)
um i think somebody tweeted that the uk (79:00 - 79:06)
regionals or whatever only had like 14 (79:04 - 79:08)
people register (79:06 - 79:10)
oof (79:08 - 79:10)
it was free it was free to register yeah (79:10 - 79:15)
or not register but like there was no (79:13 - 79:16)
like limitation you could sign up if you (79:15 - 79:19)
wanted to (79:16 - 79:21)
um (79:19 - 79:23)
uh this is from brandon what is uh what (79:21 - 79:26)
are the podcast slash ise goals for when (79:23 - 79:28)
scarlett and violet come out later this (79:26 - 79:30)
year (79:28 - 79:30)
i don't set the goals for this program i (79:33 - 79:38)
can't answer that question (79:35 - 79:38)
ah (79:38 - 79:44)
to make podcasts we're gonna do a series (79:40 - 79:47)
yeah i i i our series is always do well (79:44 - 79:50)
the sword and shield series um did (79:47 - 79:52)
incredibly well compared to (79:50 - 79:55)
like the let's go (79:52 - 79:57)
um to like bdsp bdsb was actually worse (79:55 - 79:59)
than let's go when it came to (79:57 - 80:01)
podcast series (79:59 - 80:02)
uh legends we did something different (80:01 - 80:04)
but i i think people liked the just (80:02 - 80:07)
bonus episode a week for legends but (80:04 - 80:08)
cash we didn't even know what that (80:07 - 80:11)
structure was going to be like (80:08 - 80:13)
um (80:11 - 80:13)
i don't know a goal (80:13 - 80:17)
but (80:16 - 80:18)
maybe because we haven't seen anything (80:17 - 80:20)
for (80:18 - 80:22)
scarlet and violet it just seemed the (80:20 - 80:24)
lead up to sword and shield as great as (80:22 - 80:26)
those games are (80:24 - 80:27)
still are (80:26 - 80:30)
um there was just so much negativity to (80:27 - 80:34)
that lead up and it was mentally taxing (80:30 - 80:35)
to (80:34 - 80:40)
talk about that and like also (80:35 - 80:41)
actually have faith that those games (80:40 - 80:43)
were going to turn out as as as good as (80:41 - 80:44)
they did (80:43 - 80:45)
um (80:44 - 80:47)
so again we haven't seen anything from (80:45 - 80:49)
scarlet violet besides starters but (80:47 - 80:54)
uh i hope it's not that same path again (80:49 - 80:54)
here's the thing i think the negativity (80:58 - 81:04)
around sword and shield sprung up (81:00 - 81:04)
very suddenly and very loudly like i (81:04 - 81:11)
think it was hard to (81:07 - 81:11)
in in what had generally for me been a (81:12 - 81:18)
very very positive or mostly neutral (81:14 - 81:19)
uh (81:18 - 81:22)
fandom to have a very sudden (81:19 - 81:24)
huge huge huge negative reaction to (81:22 - 81:25)
things that are just like (81:24 - 81:26)
wow (81:25 - 81:29)
okay i expect this from star wars fandom (81:26 - 81:31)
not here i think going into the new (81:29 - 81:34)
games having lived through it and then (81:31 - 81:36)
sort of lived through a bunch of other (81:34 - 81:39)
things i have a better perspective of (81:36 - 81:41)
what i will take what i'm willing to (81:39 - 81:42)
walk away from (81:41 - 81:44)
what i will listen to and what i'm no (81:42 - 81:46)
longer willing to listen to (81:44 - 81:48)
um and i think that that (81:46 - 81:50)
will make covering (81:48 - 81:53)
scarlet and violet way easier for me (81:50 - 81:55)
than it was the lead up to sword and (81:53 - 81:57)
shield um (81:55 - 81:58)
but i think during sword and shield it (81:57 - 82:01)
was really hard to (81:58 - 82:03)
differentiate out (82:01 - 82:06)
the level of toxicity people were like (82:03 - 82:07)
are you (82:06 - 82:08)
are you the type of person that's just (82:07 - 82:11)
toxic hates everything and is just here (82:08 - 82:14)
because you hate doing things or are you (82:11 - 82:16)
the person that really really loves (82:14 - 82:18)
a thing and really (82:16 - 82:21)
is having a hard time reconciling where (82:18 - 82:22)
you're gonna fit in this and like (82:21 - 82:25)
finding those people and finding out (82:22 - 82:27)
like how what the (82:25 - 82:30)
sort of what the red flags are was a (82:27 - 82:31)
tough experience for sword shield that i (82:30 - 82:34)
think i'm much more prepared going into (82:31 - 82:34)
games (82:34 - 82:36)
from now on (82:34 - 82:38)
um (82:36 - 82:40)
so i'm less worried about covering (82:38 - 82:42)
scarlet and violet because of negativity (82:40 - 82:45)
because i i sort of already know who my (82:42 - 82:47)
bad actors are and i have a much better (82:45 - 82:52)
idea of what the red flags are for me (82:47 - 82:52)
uh this is from youtube (82:59 - 83:03)
if you would like to like comment (83:02 - 83:07)
subscribe uh hello youtube people (83:03 - 83:08)
uh feel free to do that now thank you (83:07 - 83:10)
for making it this far in the episode by (83:08 - 83:12)
the way uh this is from matthew question (83:10 - 83:14)
of the week uh what pokemon from (83:12 - 83:16)
previous generations do you think should (83:14 - 83:18)
be included in scarlet and violet (83:16 - 83:21)
uh rosalia (83:18 - 83:24)
it has been in every game (83:21 - 83:28)
every game and if they break my heart (83:24 - 83:30)
with scarlet and violet (83:28 - 83:32)
i don't know that i can continue with (83:30 - 83:33)
this series (83:32 - 83:36)
well what what pokemon goes best with (83:33 - 83:39)
the theme of the risotto uh who would be (83:36 - 83:41)
a good natavis (83:39 - 83:43)
uh you know that (83:41 - 83:44)
i think somebody said this the other day (83:43 - 83:47)
and it made me think like um in in the (83:44 - 83:49)
alola pokedex entry it says that young (83:47 - 83:51)
goose comes from another region it's not (83:49 - 83:53)
native to alola (83:51 - 83:55)
uh it's like the mongoose isn't native (83:53 - 83:57)
to hawaii (83:55 - 83:57)
so i i think young goose would be good (83:58 - 84:03)
in in scotland violet i think uh spain (84:01 - 84:06)
has some mongoose i don't think that i (84:03 - 84:07)
mean the question is is (84:06 - 84:09)
it now that they've done regional forms (84:07 - 84:10)
right like (84:09 - 84:12)
is (84:10 - 84:14)
young goose (84:12 - 84:17)
uh alolan actually a regional form and (84:14 - 84:19)
the the real form (84:17 - 84:21)
uh uh a different the real (84:19 - 84:24)
the real mongoose is in this one like it (84:21 - 84:26)
gets hard because of regional forms and (84:24 - 84:28)
what they're gonna decide (84:26 - 84:30)
belong here and change and regional (84:28 - 84:35)
forums is prioritize gen one right (84:30 - 84:35)
um (84:35 - 84:39)
i mean that what do i always think what (84:37 - 84:42)
do i want from gen eight to carry in i (84:39 - 84:45)
want yamper to carry in (84:42 - 84:46)
i want (84:45 - 84:49)
um (84:46 - 84:51)
i want somehow the jesuian force that we (84:49 - 84:53)
got to carry in because i like a lot of (84:51 - 84:55)
them a lot (84:53 - 84:57)
um i want (84:55 - 84:58)
yamper would be good just because of the (84:57 - 85:00)
right ability literally (84:58 - 85:04)
i want ampere in i want um snom in (85:00 - 85:08)
i would like no snow in spain (85:04 - 85:11)
look there's no snow in hawaii (85:08 - 85:14)
there's snow in hawaii (85:11 - 85:14)
not that far down (85:14 - 85:18)
uh (85:17 - 85:22)
i would like um for for no good reason (85:18 - 85:24)
other than i think it's fun i want (85:22 - 85:26)
stojaner in there i don't know i don't (85:24 - 85:29)
think there's a lot of hinges around (85:26 - 85:31)
spain but (85:29 - 85:32)
it's close (85:31 - 85:34)
but i mean i would like to see like pile (85:32 - 85:35)
of sand make it because there are (85:34 - 85:37)
beaches (85:35 - 85:38)
that is true (85:37 - 85:39)
i (85:38 - 85:42)
would like to see oricorio but (85:39 - 85:45)
maybe either (85:42 - 85:48)
just by lay form or (85:45 - 85:52)
it has new forms oh yeah a new dancer (85:48 - 85:55)
tango flamenco oh there you go would be (85:52 - 85:58)
so good (85:55 - 85:58)
um (86:01 - 86:03)
i feel like there are pokemon i would (86:05 - 86:09)
not want to see i don't want cramer to (86:07 - 86:11)
carry forward leave that in galler yeah (86:09 - 86:13)
there's no need for kramer it had its (86:11 - 86:16)
moment and that's the end (86:13 - 86:17)
here's a here's a question do you think (86:16 - 86:19)
that uh (86:17 - 86:21)
all of the (86:19 - 86:23)
new pokemon (86:21 - 86:26)
when i say new pokemon i mean like (86:23 - 86:29)
we're dear vasco legion (86:26 - 86:31)
cleaver do you think they're all (86:29 - 86:32)
guaranteed (86:31 - 86:34)
in this game no (86:32 - 86:37)
no (86:34 - 86:39)
i don't know those are ancient pokemon (86:37 - 86:41)
from old times that didn't right right (86:39 - 86:43)
but they they did they did show zoroark (86:41 - 86:46)
so that confirms zarua yeah i i i don't (86:43 - 86:48)
so so if we're talking even if you can't (86:46 - 86:50)
get basket legion if you move over a (86:48 - 86:53)
basketland because basklin's in there (86:50 - 86:54)
then theoretically you could get basket (86:53 - 86:56)
legion same way (86:54 - 86:58)
why are we talking about will they be (86:56 - 87:01)
available in the game (86:58 - 87:01)
was that game because the time (87:02 - 87:07)
correction (87:05 - 87:07)
will they be are we talking about (87:08 - 87:12)
catchable in the wild (87:10 - 87:13)
available or (87:12 - 87:15)
can be transferred in available because (87:13 - 87:17)
i think those are two different (87:15 - 87:20)
topics (87:17 - 87:20)
i'm approaching it of things that i want (87:20 - 87:25)
to be added to the catchable pokebox as (87:22 - 87:27)
you're playing the game and i think (87:25 - 87:29)
jesuian forms would be a post game you (87:27 - 87:31)
can transfer them in yeah i think i (87:29 - 87:32)
think transferable (87:31 - 87:35)
oh okay so it's like (87:32 - 87:37)
it's like do (87:35 - 87:39)
do i want growlithe in the game and (87:37 - 87:42)
arcanine in the game and if i say no i (87:39 - 87:44)
don't want those in the game then (87:42 - 87:46)
there's no way jesus and greloth and (87:44 - 87:48)
ensuing arcanine can come in (87:46 - 87:50)
but if i say yes i do want growlithe and (87:48 - 87:52)
i do want arcanine then there would be (87:50 - 87:55)
no reason that you couldn't transfer you (87:52 - 88:00)
know postgame i don't want to carry over (87:55 - 88:01)
zubat (88:00 - 88:02)
magikarp (88:01 - 88:04)
give him a rest (88:02 - 88:06)
give him i don't give him a genitals i (88:04 - 88:08)
don't think that's possible yeah i don't (88:06 - 88:12)
gosh magikarp seems like a guaranteed (88:08 - 88:13)
you know i also thought psyduck seemed (88:12 - 88:15)
to guarantee and they they did hold it (88:13 - 88:18)
to what crown tundra or isle of armor i (88:15 - 88:20)
love armor (88:18 - 88:23)
but maybe maybe do a different (88:20 - 88:26)
fish that you catch make it golden (88:23 - 88:28)
no you can get rid of that too (88:26 - 88:30)
yeah goldbean (88:28 - 88:34)
there's no need for goldie to come back (88:30 - 88:34)
um (88:34 - 88:37)
yeah i don't i don't know (88:44 - 88:47)
like is is is there a point where (88:47 - 88:52)
like every legend made it in the sword (88:51 - 88:54)
and shield (88:52 - 88:55)
every ultra beast made it into sword and (88:54 - 88:57)
shield so i don't i don't think there's (88:55 - 88:58)
i don't think there's a world where (88:57 - 89:01)
there's not a third version or there's (88:58 - 89:03)
not dlc where every legend comes back (89:01 - 89:05)
because that's how they've pretty much (89:03 - 89:07)
ended every game at this point like (89:05 - 89:09)
ultrasound ultra moon was that (89:07 - 89:12)
uh sword and shield was that black 2 (89:09 - 89:15)
white 2 was that black 2y2 (89:12 - 89:18)
um even auras i think had every legend (89:15 - 89:21)
as well if i remember correctly because (89:18 - 89:23)
of hoopa (89:21 - 89:25)
um (89:23 - 89:26)
so i i don't want to say like oh i don't (89:25 - 89:28)
want to see landorus come back because (89:26 - 89:31)
of competitive but (89:28 - 89:32)
every (89:31 - 89:34)
like every legend just comes back it's (89:32 - 89:36)
just a selling point it's just an easy (89:34 - 89:37)
way to be like here's your chance to get (89:36 - 89:39)
every legend again (89:37 - 89:41)
um (89:39 - 89:43)
so yeah i (89:41 - 89:45)
and i i i (89:43 - 89:46)
can't (89:45 - 89:48)
imagine that this game wouldn't have an (89:46 - 89:50)
amorists (89:48 - 89:51)
right like (89:50 - 89:53)
they probably want you to show off an (89:51 - 89:56)
amorous and use an amorous i can imagine (89:53 - 90:00)
that this game wouldn't have that (89:56 - 90:00)
i mean i could imagine a lot of things (90:01 - 90:05)
yeah (90:03 - 90:05)
yeah but i just yeah i feel like a (90:06 - 90:09)
pokemon like an amaris is just like a (90:07 - 90:12)
shoe-in at this point (90:09 - 90:12)
you know to be fair though i didn't (90:12 - 90:14)
think (90:14 - 90:18)
they were going to do bdsp and be like (90:14 - 90:22)
score money right can't have them yeah (90:18 - 90:23)
like that was shocking to me that they (90:22 - 90:25)
were like nope this is only the first (90:23 - 90:29)
400 literally nothing else (90:25 - 90:32)
because i just think of (90:29 - 90:34)
i do think of like somebody who's their (90:32 - 90:36)
first game was sword and shield and it (90:34 - 90:37)
was their favorite game and they fell in (90:36 - 90:39)
love with it was their first time having (90:37 - 90:41)
pokemon their favorite pokemon was (90:39 - 90:42)
cinderace and then (90:41 - 90:44)
second pokemon game ever is going to be (90:42 - 90:47)
bdsp oh i can't cannot take it cannot (90:44 - 90:50)
take it it's very well they've they're (90:47 - 90:53)
learning the hard lessons (90:50 - 90:53)
25 years like we did (90:53 - 90:58)
yeah i mean i i've talked about the (90:56 - 91:00)
lesson that i had when i was a kid of (90:58 - 91:02)
like moving all of my pokemon from (91:00 - 91:04)
pokemon blue into pokemon silver and (91:02 - 91:07)
then when i found out that i could not (91:04 - 91:09)
move those into ruby and sapphire i was (91:07 - 91:12)
like you know what (91:09 - 91:14)
pokemon's not cool i get made fun of for (91:12 - 91:15)
not liking pokemon i cannot move my (91:14 - 91:17)
pokemon over (91:15 - 91:19)
time to play some different games so (91:17 - 91:20)
you're a quitter that's what you're (91:19 - 91:22)
saying i did quit yeah (91:20 - 91:26)
12 year 13 13 year old hell 13 or 14 i (91:22 - 91:27)
think (91:26 - 91:29)
i think ruby and sapphire came out when (91:27 - 91:31)
i was 14. so i think i threw in the (91:29 - 91:32)
towel (91:31 - 91:34)
around 13 because i would have been (91:32 - 91:37)
reading like nintendo power of of you (91:34 - 91:38)
know these games coming out and being (91:37 - 91:41)
like oh they look cool but also (91:38 - 91:44)
i'm not cool for liking pokemon (91:41 - 91:46)
speaking of pokemon pokemon of the week (91:44 - 91:49)
so last week's pokemon just to break it (91:46 - 91:51)
down and make it as simple as possible (91:49 - 91:53)
it's a rock type dog that can have three (91:51 - 91:55)
forms (91:53 - 91:55)
i don't know what that is it's (91:56 - 92:02)
arcanine (92:00 - 92:02)
no it's lycanrock (92:02 - 92:07)
is there any other pokemon that can have (92:05 - 92:09)
three (92:07 - 92:09)
before forms (92:11 - 92:11)
say that again (92:13 - 92:19)
three four magee three four coming out (92:15 - 92:19)
yeah yeah (92:19 - 92:24)
three form pokemon (92:21 - 92:28)
i mean technically mouth has like 80 so (92:24 - 92:30)
oricorio has four (92:28 - 92:33)
perfur has like 12 12. (92:30 - 92:35)
minier has (92:33 - 92:39)
six six (92:35 - 92:39)
meowth has like five (92:42 - 92:47)
or four (92:44 - 92:47)
meowth (92:47 - 92:53)
meowth glaring meowth alolan meowth (92:49 - 92:56)
giganta gigantomax meowth (92:53 - 92:56)
uh (92:57 - 92:59)
no just me out that was the real yeah (92:59 - 93:04)
that was the real shocker (93:01 - 93:04)
i think meowth may be the taker because (93:05 - 93:10)
i don't really count gigantomax as a (93:08 - 93:12)
as a form (93:10 - 93:14)
oh yeah that's a feature (93:12 - 93:17)
yeah i guess it's like special though (93:14 - 93:17)
long cat is long (93:17 - 93:21)
you use long caffeine that's a good (93:19 - 93:24)
chunky anti-max it's really good (93:21 - 93:25)
that's how i can tell who people who (93:24 - 93:27)
don't like sword and shield because like (93:25 - 93:29)
how do you not look at gigantomax meowth (93:27 - 93:30)
and not be like this is incredible this (93:29 - 93:34)
is perfect (93:30 - 93:34)
what's our uh (93:37 - 93:41)
no trivia no no i mean shuffle is great (93:38 - 93:44)
all of the shinies are real good (93:41 - 93:47)
uh lykan rock and mr mime (93:44 - 93:49)
you ready for this trivia (93:47 - 93:51)
like rock and mr mom are the only two (93:49 - 93:55)
pokemon to have a known six possible (93:51 - 93:58)
abilities between their forms the most (93:55 - 94:01)
of any pokemon (93:58 - 94:01)
among their forms hmm (94:03 - 94:09)
people are working hard for this trivia (94:06 - 94:10)
i guess (94:09 - 94:12)
all right real hard if that's it then (94:10 - 94:14)
i'm gonna let's do this week's pokemon (94:12 - 94:15)
and (94:14 - 94:17)
this this week's pokemon is designed for (94:15 - 94:19)
the people who don't understand that (94:17 - 94:20)
pokemon of the week is supposed to be (94:19 - 94:23)
more poetry than logic problem so we're (94:20 - 94:25)
going to do a logic problem (94:23 - 94:26)
oh (94:25 - 94:29)
mr anderson goes to the store (94:26 - 94:33)
you buy you poke the baby (94:29 - 94:33)
here we go (94:33 - 94:38)
in the national pokedex this pokemon (94:36 - 94:40)
sits between two odd-numbered pokemon in (94:38 - 94:42)
the regional pokedex it sits between two (94:40 - 94:45)
even-numbered pokemon (94:42 - 94:47)
in the national pokedex it has type (94:45 - 94:48)
weakness to the pokemon that comes (94:47 - 94:50)
before it and is followed by a (94:48 - 94:53)
monoelectric type even though i believe (94:50 - 94:55)
it should be water electric type in the (94:53 - 94:57)
regional pokedex the pokemon that comes (94:55 - 95:00)
before this week's pokemon shares a type (94:57 - 95:02)
with the pokemon that comes after it in (95:00 - 95:04)
the national pokedex this week's pokemon (95:02 - 95:07)
can potentially have stab type (95:04 - 95:10)
effectiveness against the pokemon that (95:07 - 95:13)
follows it in the regional pokedex this (95:10 - 95:15)
week's pokemon shares its non-hidden (95:13 - 95:17)
ability with one other pokemon that (95:15 - 95:19)
originated in the same region that (95:17 - 95:21)
pokemon is an alternate evolution of a (95:19 - 95:23)
pokemon that also has two differing (95:21 - 95:25)
evolutions from other regions we have (95:23 - 95:27)
not heard of any subsequent pokemon to (95:25 - 95:30)
this week's pokemon having this ability (95:27 - 95:31)
this week's pokemon shares a key (95:30 - 95:33)
characteristic with another pokemon (95:31 - 95:35)
that's final evolution may either have (95:33 - 95:37)
strong potential stab type effectiveness (95:35 - 95:39)
against this week's pokemon or have (95:37 - 95:42)
normal potential stab type effectiveness (95:39 - 95:44)
effectiveness against this week's (95:42 - 95:46)
pokemon there you go very clear very (95:44 - 95:48)
obvious (95:46 - 95:51)
i feel like this is your hardest one (95:48 - 95:54)
it's it's real simple (95:51 - 95:56)
there was one sentence in there that (95:54 - 95:58)
gave it away (95:56 - 95:58)
hey thanks for listening to this week's (96:00 - 96:06)
podcast thanks for making it to the end (96:01 - 96:07)
uh we will be back (96:06 - 96:09)
next week (96:07 - 96:12)
uh this week is go fest um (96:09 - 96:14)
the the world wide go fest it'll be uh (96:12 - 96:16)
june 4th and june 5th (96:14 - 96:18)
if you're listening to this (96:16 - 96:19)
um (96:18 - 96:21)
i believe greg will and i will be (96:19 - 96:23)
playing together um (96:21 - 96:25)
we got to ask greg about locations i (96:23 - 96:27)
think art park all right parked on (96:25 - 96:28)
saturday (96:27 - 96:30)
and i heard the zoo is a good place to (96:28 - 96:32)
play greg is this true saint uh uh st (96:30 - 96:33)
paul (96:32 - 96:35)
oh como oh como's a brilliant place to (96:33 - 96:36)
play yeah maybe we do that sunday uh (96:35 - 96:39)
yeah we can do that because uh (96:36 - 96:41)
there's a lot of people that go there so (96:39 - 96:43)
silverwood park aka the art park (96:41 - 96:45)
saturday and then como (96:43 - 96:48)
como commons como zoo komo conservation (96:45 - 96:51)
i'm assuming the zoo has more gyms (96:48 - 96:54)
yes so that would be a better sunday (96:51 - 96:56)
anyways yeah yeah assuming sunday is a (96:54 - 96:58)
great day to be fair (96:56 - 96:59)
i haven't been there since they updated (96:58 - 97:01)
all the gyms (96:59 - 97:02)
so we just got it out (97:01 - 97:05)
i think i think they do otherwise like (97:02 - 97:08)
we can the thing is is that come was (97:05 - 97:09)
huge (97:08 - 97:10)
um so they should technically have a lot (97:09 - 97:13)
more gyms (97:10 - 97:14)
um so (97:13 - 97:16)
i don't know how a recording will be (97:14 - 97:18)
working for that i don't know if we we (97:16 - 97:20)
just record early or record at like (97:18 - 97:22)
after go fest on saturday night or (97:20 - 97:24)
sunday night i'm not sure what the the (97:22 - 97:26)
situation is i would assume that that (97:24 - 97:27)
would be you know our thoughts about go (97:26 - 97:29)
fest i don't actually know if we're (97:27 - 97:31)
gonna get any other pokemon news this (97:29 - 97:33)
week because they're probably every i'm (97:31 - 97:35)

twitter everything's gonna be (97:35 - 97:39)
advertising for go fest (97:36 - 97:41)
and then i i would (97:39 - 97:43)
wager to guess that we'll be we'll get (97:41 - 97:45)
scarlet violet news (97:43 - 97:46)
um (97:45 - 97:49)
after go fest is complete and probably (97:46 - 97:51)

they do a huge scarlet and violet (97:53 - 97:57)

uh twitter youtube all that pk mncst i (98:52 - 98:58)
don't know if i can get this video out (98:57 - 99:00)
this week but i (98:58 - 99:03)
i went from start to finish and i caught (99:00 - 99:05)
a shiny shaman in bdsp (99:03 - 99:08)
i created the proper puffins i fed it (99:05 - 99:11)
the puffins i (99:08 - 99:14)
got the the the scarfs i did the (99:11 - 99:15)
contests (99:14 - 99:18)
i battled cynthia 20 times to get (99:15 - 99:20)
champion stickers to put on to the ball (99:18 - 99:23)
capsule to get the sparkling twilight (99:20 - 99:26)
star ponyta ribbon whatever it's called (99:23 - 99:29)
i did it all from start to finish i want (99:26 - 99:31)
to make a whole video on how to do that (99:29 - 99:34)
because it was uh it was a lot of work (99:31 - 99:37)
and i think i figured out what (99:34 - 99:40)
the thing that i realized is people will (99:37 - 99:42)
be like here's how you do the puffins (99:40 - 99:44)
and it's like cool and then people be (99:42 - 99:45)
like (99:44 - 99:46)
there was really nothing i could find of (99:45 - 99:47)
like (99:46 - 99:50)
why you do certain things in contests (99:47 - 99:51)
and i figured that out and it makes it (99:50 - 99:52)
easy (99:51 - 99:53)
um (99:52 - 99:55)
and then the champion sticker part is it (99:53 - 99:57)
nowhere is anyone talking about that (99:55 - 99:58)
part so (99:57 - 100:00)
hopefully we get that video out this (99:58 - 100:01)
week if not that'll probably go up on (100:00 - 100:03)
