episode of the pokemon podcast it's (0:30 - 0:35)
super effective i'm your host sbj with (0:33 - 0:36)
me (0:35 - 0:39)
is greg hello i am here for this (0:36 - 0:43)
spooky tacular pokemon event (0:39 - 0:45)
all the ghost types are out i have my (0:43 - 0:47)
sableye buddy (0:45 - 0:49)
skitting around getting me a whole lot (0:47 - 0:50)
of nothing (0:49 - 0:52)
i don't think the ghost type event (0:50 - 0:54)
started yet did it (0:52 - 0:56)
uh i okay here's the thing and i'm gonna (0:54 - 0:57)
this is what annoys me (0:56 - 1:00)
i get i get a banner notification saying (0:57 - 1:01)
hey (1:00 - 1:03)
pop into pokemon go and read about the (1:01 - 1:04)
ghost event so i do (1:03 - 1:07)
does the ghost event news show up (1:04 - 1:08)
absolutely doesn't (1:07 - 1:11)
so how does it send me the notification (1:08 - 1:13)
but not the actual news story (1:11 - 1:16)
will is here to explain that to you i (1:13 - 1:19)
have no explanation other than the news (1:16 - 1:21)
alerts in pokemon go (1:19 - 1:24)
are absolute trash (1:21 - 1:27)
and you probably are just behind a few (1:24 - 1:28)
days (1:27 - 1:30)
on news alerts so you haven't been (1:28 - 1:32)
hitting okay to view them so it got (1:30 - 1:34)
stuck on one and now you're behind for (1:32 - 1:35)
all time (1:34 - 1:36)
i think they can send a push (1:35 - 1:38)
notification without like needing to (1:36 - 1:40)
direct you to something (1:38 - 1:43)
it says ghost event read it says read in (1:40 - 1:44)
the news (1:43 - 1:46)
read the news in the app in the (1:44 - 1:48)
notification yeah but what i'm saying is (1:46 - 1:49)
somebody (1:48 - 1:51)
probably sent the push notification but (1:49 - 1:52)
the other person (1:51 - 1:55)
didn't send the article (1:52 - 1:55)
not the news button well get it together (1:57 - 2:00)

october 15th acerola in mimikyu (3:08 - 3:15)
and hilbert and mighty yenna in pokemon (3:12 - 3:18)
masters alright well this is the (3:15 - 3:19)
this is the 20 minutes where we talk (3:18 - 3:21)
about why these (3:19 - 3:24)
trainers have these pokemon well no i (3:21 - 3:24)
mean we (3:24 - 3:27)
know why acerola has mimicked you right (3:24 - 3:27)
now that's (3:27 - 3:30)
a given it's the hilbert mystery the (3:27 - 3:31)
hillbilly (3:30 - 3:33)
mystery is the mystery okay well let me (3:31 - 3:34)
let me (3:33 - 3:35)
read and then we can talk about the (3:34 - 3:37)
mystery i (3:35 - 3:39)
i'm very happy that this podcast has (3:37 - 3:41)
turned into a crime drama (3:39 - 3:43)
a costume a couple costume sink pairs (3:41 - 3:44)
have arrived (3:43 - 3:46)
in time for spooky season halloween is (3:44 - 3:48)
approaching you can bet (3:46 - 3:51)
that the isle uh island not nile (3:48 - 3:54)
island of pa passio is getting ready to (3:51 - 3:55)
celebrate from october 14th through (3:54 - 3:57)
november 1st (3:55 - 3:59)
pokemon masters ex players will find two (3:57 - 4:01)
festive five star sink pairs (3:59 - 4:04)
with ghost type ace rolla and mimikyu (4:01 - 4:04)
and (4:04 - 4:08)
dark type hilbert and maitiena not only (4:04 - 4:09)
are these pokemon trainers ready for (4:08 - 4:09)
battle (4:09 - 4:11)
with their partner pokemon they are (4:09 - 4:13)
dressed like their pokemon too (4:11 - 4:15)
and both of these trainers can become (4:13 - 4:17)
six star ex (4:15 - 4:19)
if uh you know in about two years you'll (4:17 - 4:21)
be able to get there with them (4:19 - 4:24)
and i think the mimikyu one is like (4:21 - 4:26)
shiny when it's six star ex which is (4:24 - 4:27)
kind of cool (4:26 - 4:30)
or her outfit is i think it's her outfit (4:27 - 4:30)
not though (4:30 - 4:32)
yeah mimikyu doesn't magically turn (4:30 - 4:35)
shiny but (4:32 - 4:35)
acerola's uh six star sync pair turns (4:36 - 4:40)
shiny (4:39 - 4:42)
i believe what is a what does a shiny (4:40 - 4:43)
mimic you look like it's like (4:42 - 4:46)
monochrome yeah it's just like (4:43 - 4:50)
gray black and white oh i want that yeah (4:46 - 4:50)
it looks good (4:50 - 4:54)
i am breeding well next the next one (4:50 - 4:57)
my next shiny hunt will be a mimikyu (4:54 - 5:01)
okay i don't want to ruin the (4:57 - 5:04)
okay so i went to dna and i said why is (5:01 - 5:06)
it (5:04 - 5:08)
why is it hilbert and mighty anna and (5:06 - 5:10)
not brendan and mighty anna cause that (5:08 - 5:11)
makes (5:10 - 5:14)
way more sense right uh for those that (5:11 - 5:15)
don't know (5:14 - 5:17)
the like puchienna is what you gotta (5:15 - 5:19)
fight off with your starter pokemon as (5:17 - 5:20)
brendan or may (5:19 - 5:22)
in in ruby and sapphire and i think (5:20 - 5:23)
emerald right emerald has the same (5:22 - 5:24)
opening too yep (5:23 - 5:27)
and their response was we know that (5:24 - 5:28)
pokemon masters is canon (5:27 - 5:30)
obviously it says on pokemon.com that it (5:28 - 5:32)
is made by (5:30 - 5:34)
published by the pokemon company etc etc (5:32 - 5:36)
so there's your boring (5:34 - 5:39)
answer uh so that translates to uh (5:36 - 5:42)
whatever i do what i want well i did ask (5:39 - 5:44)
basically the pokemon company decided (5:42 - 5:46)
if hilbert should have been with my (5:44 - 5:48)
deanna or (5:46 - 5:50)
dna did and they said that they both (5:48 - 5:52)
decided together sure (5:50 - 5:56)
[Laughter] (5:52 - 5:58)
okay but here's the here's the big (5:56 - 6:01)
question are both worth pulling on (5:58 - 6:04)
um i haven't seen i've heard i've (6:01 - 6:05)
actually heard that (6:04 - 6:08)
hilbert is the better of the two but i (6:05 - 6:09)
don't know if that's true (6:08 - 6:11)
probably the reason people are saying (6:09 - 6:12)
that is because there's already really (6:11 - 6:13)
good ghost (6:12 - 6:16)
type trainers in masters uh and i guess (6:13 - 6:18)
mimikyu could have either been ghost or (6:16 - 6:19)
fairy but they decided on ghost (6:18 - 6:21)
which i mean makes sense because it's a (6:19 - 6:23)
halloween event (6:21 - 6:27)
duh but uh i believe we don't have a lot (6:23 - 6:29)
of ferry right we only have um (6:27 - 6:33)
nina sylveon yeah and (6:29 - 6:36)
so three yeah i mean hilbert's pandering (6:33 - 6:38)
to somebody (6:36 - 6:43)
not me with somebody (6:38 - 6:43)
oh you know (6:43 - 6:49)
no i don't that's what i'm asking (6:46 - 6:53)
[Laughter] (6:49 - 6:57)
right now right in if it's pandering to (6:53 - 6:57)
you (6:57 - 7:01)
let us know the shift gears a little bit (6:57 - 7:06)
the this is just unfortunate timing (7:01 - 7:09)
and i am not one to defend niantic (7:06 - 7:11)
i think that's very best because i've (7:09 - 7:14)
been very clear on this show (7:11 - 7:14)
but they uh pokemon.com they added (7:16 - 7:23)
12k eggs during a pandemic (7:19 - 7:27)
when they removed the walking bonus (7:23 - 7:30)
at the start of the month the timing is (7:27 - 7:32)
incredibly poor here (7:30 - 7:35)
also getting those 12k eggs is super (7:32 - 7:36)
frustrating (7:35 - 7:40)
yup why is it frustrating well here let (7:36 - 7:41)
me read the blog post we can talk about (7:40 - 7:42)
it (7:41 - 7:44)
yeah uh hatch a strange egg rescue (7:42 - 7:46)
shadow mewtwo and catch (7:44 - 7:49)
shiny shadow pokemon in pokemon go uh (7:46 - 7:50)
team rocket is causing more trouble in (7:49 - 7:51)
pokemon go (7:50 - 7:54)
and your eggs your eggs (7:51 - 7:57)
oh i get it it's like well they should (7:54 - 7:58)
not have hyphenated (7:57 - 8:01)
that terrible word yeah it's it's (7:58 - 8:03)
exactly but with eggs i was very (8:01 - 8:04)
confused for a minute (8:03 - 8:08)
from october 12th through october 19th (8:04 - 8:10)
you can help take town team rocket (8:08 - 8:11)
during this event i actually didn't know (8:10 - 8:13)
this event was limited (8:11 - 8:15)
yeah it's very limited during this time (8:13 - 8:16)
you can find a new type of pokemon egg (8:15 - 8:18)
called strange eggs for the first time (8:16 - 8:20)
in pokemon go (8:18 - 8:22)
strange eggs hatch into poison or dark (8:20 - 8:23)
type pokemon (8:22 - 8:25)
as well as pokemon that acquire either (8:23 - 8:27)
of those types through evolution such as (8:25 - 8:30)
larvaetar scraggy trubish (8:27 - 8:32)
vullabai if you're uh you know playing (8:30 - 8:33)
with some (8:32 - 8:36)
pokemon go players who are very bad at (8:33 - 8:38)
saying pokemon names because (8:36 - 8:40)
they've only played red and blue which (8:38 - 8:41)
is totally fine uh (8:40 - 8:44)
so velabi it's lullaby because it's (8:41 - 8:46)
lullaby so that's your easy way to (8:44 - 8:48)
remember there (8:46 - 8:50)
uh you can find strange eggs by (8:48 - 8:51)
defeating team rocket (8:50 - 8:54)
team go rocket and hatch eggs by walking (8:51 - 8:55)
12 kilometers (8:54 - 8:56)
strange eggs will be available in (8:55 - 8:58)
pokemon go after the event ends so you (8:56 - 9:00)
don't have to worry (8:58 - 9:02)
you have to get your hands on one uh (9:00 - 9:03)
poison or dark type pokemon like (9:02 - 9:04)
spinarak (9:03 - 9:08)
houndhour poochie yenna gulpin stunky (9:04 - 9:10)
per loin and others will be appearing (9:08 - 9:12)
more frequently in the wild during the (9:10 - 9:12)
event (9:12 - 9:15)
be sure to take snapshots for surprises (9:12 - 9:17)
you will also begin (9:15 - 9:20)
uh gain access to a new special research (9:17 - 9:21)
story called (9:20 - 9:23)
in in it's interesting but they put the (9:21 - 9:24)
word egg in it again (9:23 - 9:26)
development completing the special (9:24 - 9:28)
research will lead you to a conference (9:26 - 9:29)
confrontation (9:28 - 9:31)
against giovanni himself defeat him in (9:29 - 9:32)
battle and you will have a chance to (9:31 - 9:34)
rescue shadow mewtwo (9:32 - 9:36)
i believe if you had a gofest ticket you (9:34 - 9:37)
will get a second one here (9:36 - 9:39)
during the event you will come across (9:37 - 9:40)
more pokestops that have been taken over (9:39 - 9:42)
by team go rocket (9:40 - 9:43)
you will encounter more team go rocket (9:42 - 9:46)
balloons (9:43 - 9:48)
it's like balloon city for the like the (9:46 - 9:49)
last like six months (9:48 - 9:52)
yeah the nefarious team go rocket grunts (9:49 - 9:53)
will frequently be partnered with shadow (9:52 - 9:56)
pokemon like diglett slowpoke sheldor (9:53 - 9:59)
aerodactyl hoppip and skarmory team go (9:56 - 10:00)
rocket leaders will be using different (9:59 - 10:02)
shadow pokemon including growlithe (10:00 - 10:04)
drowsy and omanite those three can be (10:02 - 10:06)
shiny if you're lucky (10:04 - 10:09)
oh it literally says that next sentence (10:06 - 10:11)
from (10:09 - 10:11)
uh and then there are new avatar themed (10:11 - 10:15)
items in the store (10:13 - 10:18)
uh okay so one you can find (10:15 - 10:20)
a strange egg by defeating a team go (10:18 - 10:22)
rocket leader (10:20 - 10:25)
leader claw cliff (10:22 - 10:29)
and sierra yeah not not so not just a (10:25 - 10:30)
regular grunt (10:29 - 10:33)
yeah so it has to be a leader (10:30 - 10:36)
yeah you have to have you have to be (10:33 - 10:39)
six grunts to get the leader which means (10:36 - 10:41)
you have to defeat grunts (10:39 - 10:44)
either in balloons are not spinning any (10:41 - 10:46)
stops because if you have a spot (10:44 - 10:47)
and then you spin the stop you get an (10:46 - 10:49)
egg and then you have to try to quickly (10:47 - 10:50)
hatch the egg (10:49 - 10:53)
when the walk bonus has been removed so (10:50 - 10:54)
then (10:53 - 10:55)
like you have and you can't get you (10:54 - 10:57)
can't just get rid of eggs you can't (10:55 - 10:58)
trash them (10:57 - 11:01)
yeah so you have to like time this (10:58 - 11:04)
so perfectly and hope that you get a (11:01 - 11:06)
leader and that leader gives you an egg (11:04 - 11:09)
it's super frustrating yeah and (11:06 - 11:11)
i got one egg and when it hatched i'm (11:09 - 11:13)
like that's it (11:11 - 11:15)
then (11:13 - 11:15)
there's a very easy answer to your (11:18 - 11:22)
conundrum (11:21 - 11:25)
which is buy a bunch of incubators so (11:22 - 11:26)
that you incubate (11:25 - 11:28)
all of your eggs at the same time and (11:26 - 11:29)
then you'll always have plenty of space (11:28 - 11:30)
yeah i'm not (11:29 - 11:33)
i'm not giving them money you're not (11:30 - 11:35)
about that life now i'm not about that (11:33 - 11:37)
life i'm not i'm not about that (11:35 - 11:38)
we were having this conversation in (11:37 - 11:40)
community today yesterday i am not (11:38 - 11:41)
spending money (11:40 - 11:45)
on expanding my storage because a home (11:41 - 11:47)
is coming and i refuse (11:45 - 11:51)
i think eggs are pretty lousy um (11:47 - 11:54)
okay so a couple things before i get to (11:51 - 11:54)
my my (11:54 - 11:56)
i do agree with greg with the with the (11:54 - 11:58)
egg stuff here but um (11:56 - 12:00)
what i want to say before we get to (11:58 - 12:02)
sidetracked is i'm (12:00 - 12:05)
i'm sure that a company (12:02 - 12:07)
well first off i'm sure that the pokemon (12:05 - 12:09)
company in niantic they have a timeline (12:07 - 12:11)
for things right they know when gen 6 is (12:09 - 12:12)
coming they probably roughly know when (12:11 - 12:14)
gen 7 is coming they probably know what (12:12 - 12:17)
the next couple communion days are right (12:14 - 12:18)
having (12:17 - 12:20)
a team rocket event during halloween (12:18 - 12:22)
with dark type pokemon and poison type (12:20 - 12:24)
pokemon and giovanni (12:22 - 12:27)
and shadow mewtwo kinda (12:24 - 12:29)
like doesn't seem out of the blue right (12:27 - 12:30)
it kind of lines up you know it's a (12:29 - 12:32)
couple months after go fest we know that (12:30 - 12:34)
after go fest they (12:32 - 12:36)
give us the opportunity to catch what (12:34 - 12:38)
people were able to catch (12:36 - 12:40)
so first they did victini waited a (12:38 - 12:41)
little bit now they did (12:40 - 12:44)
um the shadow mewtwo and stuff so uh (12:41 - 12:46)
i'm giving them the benefit of the doubt (12:44 - 12:49)
that they that the strange eggs thing (12:46 - 12:51)
was probably planned earlier in the year (12:49 - 12:52)
and this was all supposed to come (12:51 - 12:54)
together as like one thing i don't think (12:52 - 12:55)
that like (12:54 - 12:58)
mid pandemic they were like let's make (12:55 - 13:01)
trainers walk even more (12:58 - 13:03)
but also i mean i wonder if there's that (13:01 - 13:05)
decision of like should we not roll out (13:03 - 13:06)
this like new (13:05 - 13:10)
mechanic or should we what's the new (13:06 - 13:11)
mechanic that an egg can drop (13:10 - 13:14)
from a leader like there is nothing (13:11 - 13:18)
interesting about that mechanic that (13:14 - 13:22)
would suggest you can't just not do it (13:18 - 13:25)
like i guess the interesting thing is (13:22 - 13:27)
i'm thinking like them people are (13:25 - 13:30)
probably getting tired of team go rocket (13:27 - 13:32)
so we introduce new shadow pokemon we (13:30 - 13:35)
introduce them dropping eggs which (13:32 - 13:37)
maybe is fun for some people that like (13:35 - 13:38)
eggs uh (13:37 - 13:40)
and in those eggs there are pokemon that (13:38 - 13:42)
you've never had before like volabile (13:40 - 13:44)
i guess mechanically there's not (13:42 - 13:45)
something new here but they're giving (13:44 - 13:47)
you another reason to battle team go (13:45 - 13:48)
rocket (13:47 - 13:50)
they don't hatch a shadow pokemon though (13:48 - 13:51)
do they no no (13:50 - 13:55)
okay no and i also don't i i also (13:51 - 13:58)
tend to believe that there was (13:55 - 14:00)
probably in the pipeline we're going to (13:58 - 14:02)
start rolling back bonuses at the start (14:00 - 14:04)
of october which i think we talked about (14:02 - 14:05)
but no one knew (14:04 - 14:07)
that the pandemic was going to get worse (14:05 - 14:08)
now and then the time (14:07 - 14:11)
everybody knew that well the summer was (14:08 - 14:13)
pretty good for most countries that were (14:11 - 14:14)
not the united states (14:13 - 14:16)
yeah but everybody knows the flu gets (14:14 - 14:18)
worse yeah well everyone knows that (14:16 - 14:20)
there was gonna be a second wave (14:18 - 14:23)
everybody like you can't say that they (14:20 - 14:25)
didn't you know if if they're gonna (14:23 - 14:26)
speak out of one side of the mouth that (14:25 - 14:27)
they're (14:26 - 14:30)
closely watching the world and then out (14:27 - 14:31)
of the other side of the mouth they're (14:30 - 14:32)
like yeah but we're gonna release all (14:31 - 14:34)
this crap anyways (14:32 - 14:37)
like which isn't true either you aren't (14:34 - 14:39)
closely watching it or you are and you (14:37 - 14:41)
just don't care (14:39 - 14:43)
well i mean walking around outside isn't (14:41 - 14:45)
the worst thing you can do (14:43 - 14:48)
no it's not i mean it's but cold but (14:45 - 14:50)
well for the world up here in the (14:48 - 14:52)
majority of the country it's actually (14:50 - 14:53)
perfectly fine (14:52 - 14:56)
so i still stand by if they if they (14:53 - 14:57)
communicated that (14:56 - 14:59)
october 1st noticed better with the (14:57 - 15:01)
incense (14:59 - 15:02)
and i don't think people would have been (15:01 - 15:04)
as mad especially with the egg stuff (15:02 - 15:07)
well like reverting i think any time you (15:04 - 15:08)
can communicate (15:07 - 15:10)
appropriately and well people are less (15:08 - 15:11)
mad like (15:10 - 15:13)
at some point these companies are gonna (15:11 - 15:15)
learn like huh we get in trouble because (15:13 - 15:17)
we try to keep all these secrets and (15:15 - 15:18)
don't explain ourselves (15:17 - 15:21)
and then everybody's mad and we are (15:18 - 15:23)
keeping these secrets (15:21 - 15:26)
for no reason other than being secretive (15:23 - 15:30)
you know i i mean this is completely (15:26 - 15:33)
like side track somebody needs to (15:30 - 15:35)
research and investigate i blame apple (15:33 - 15:36)
for that (15:35 - 15:37)
yeah because they just spent all that (15:36 - 15:38)
time like we're not going to tell (15:37 - 15:40)
anybody anything and then they're gonna (15:38 - 15:42)
be so surprised and happy when they see (15:40 - 15:43)
what we got and like every other company (15:42 - 15:45)
is like oh we gotta follow what apple's (15:43 - 15:46)
doing and i'm like no (15:45 - 15:49)
just tell me what's going on dude yeah (15:46 - 15:49)
like (15:49 - 15:52)
let me like prepare my life around like (15:49 - 15:52)
if i've already (15:52 - 15:55)
invested in your product let me like be (15:52 - 15:57)
ready for the next thing (15:55 - 15:59)
i'm assuming they were listening though (15:57 - 16:00)
because they (15:59 - 16:03)
we had a half for how long it was like (16:00 - 16:05)
six months we had the half egg distance (16:03 - 16:07)
and then they gave us one fourth egg (16:05 - 16:09)
distance like five days after (16:07 - 16:12)
october first yeah (16:09 - 16:15)
maybe they're listening maybe they only (16:12 - 16:17)
care about people in australia (16:15 - 16:20)
where it's going to be summer now i will (16:17 - 16:21)
they're like (16:20 - 16:22)
the australians are getting out there (16:21 - 16:25)
they're getting outside nobody cares (16:22 - 16:26)
about the people in australia (16:25 - 16:31)
i like perth they're moms (16:26 - 16:31)
nobody likes perth now that's a fib (16:31 - 16:35)
right there come on no (16:33 - 16:37)
i (16:35 - 16:37)
i've hated the egg mechanic for a very (16:39 - 16:42)
long time (16:41 - 16:45)
back back like three years ago in (16:42 - 16:47)
pokemon go i was very naive (16:45 - 16:49)
i was buying incubators i remember like (16:47 - 16:52)
the rock type event and i bought all (16:49 - 16:53)
all these incubators and i was hatching (16:52 - 16:56)
nothing but kabutos and geodudes (16:53 - 16:58)
and i don't remember what was like the (16:56 - 17:00)
shiny that event it was very early on (16:58 - 17:02)
but i was like i swore off incubators (17:00 - 17:05)
i was like never again (17:02 - 17:10)
you incubators you this is my line (17:05 - 17:13)
i finally reached it but (17:10 - 17:17)
the times i played pokemon go uh (17:13 - 17:19)
which i was able to do three pokemon go (17:17 - 17:20)
streams on twitch (17:19 - 17:22)
i did two in austin and then i did one (17:20 - 17:24)
this past weekend in milwaukee (17:22 - 17:27)
the one fourth egg hatch (17:24 - 17:30)
distance whether it's on a 5k or a 10k (17:27 - 17:32)
or even the 12k (17:30 - 17:35)
it was awesome it felt good (17:32 - 17:37)
like it i and i didn't buy a single (17:35 - 17:39)
incubator i just used my free one (17:37 - 17:42)
and i think i hatched maybe like six or (17:39 - 17:43)
seven eggs in the four hours i played (17:42 - 17:45)
yesterday (17:43 - 17:47)
uh now the rewards were garbage i (17:45 - 17:49)
hatched four chicoritas in a row (17:47 - 17:52)
from 5k eggs and my 12k egg (17:49 - 17:55)
hatched to be a scraggy uh which (17:52 - 17:57)
i guess is better than the rubbish i (17:55 - 17:59)
don't know if it's better than the larva (17:57 - 18:03)
tar um i mean seeing as we had a lot (17:59 - 18:06)
we've had many larvitars appearing in (18:03 - 18:07)
the wild maybe this greg yeah (18:06 - 18:09)
didn't we have like a larvitar community (18:07 - 18:10)
day at one point (18:09 - 18:14)
so i got that and then my 7k eggs have (18:10 - 18:17)
i have literally had four alolan (18:14 - 18:19)
geodudes in a row (18:17 - 18:21)
well thanks for ruining pokemon of the (18:19 - 18:24)
week greg let me get back to my research (18:21 - 18:27)
but i i gosh that like the being able to (18:24 - 18:28)
hatch it that (18:27 - 18:32)
quickly and and not needing the worry of (18:28 - 18:34)
like i have all these eggs and then (18:32 - 18:35)
the only way for me to clear them is to (18:34 - 18:37)
buy them i love the 1 4 (18:35 - 18:39)
makes me like hatching eggs even though (18:37 - 18:40)
it's garbage (18:39 - 18:42)
because i'm not spending money they're (18:40 - 18:44)
hatching fast enough where like (18:42 - 18:46)
i feel like i'm i'm going through eggs (18:44 - 18:47)
like if (18:46 - 18:50)
it i i would love that to stay i know it (18:47 - 18:51)
wouldn't but (18:50 - 18:53)
it won't but now that we have so many (18:51 - 18:54)
eggs so again going back (18:53 - 18:57)
this is this is going back to your point (18:54 - 18:58)
earlier greg (18:57 - 19:00)
of like these getting these are hard to (18:58 - 19:03)
get because i can't have my pokeball (19:00 - 19:03)
plus (19:03 - 19:06)
on because if it was on it would auto (19:03 - 19:08)
spin stuff (19:06 - 19:09)
and then if it would auto spin stuff i (19:08 - 19:12)
would run the risk of getting an egg (19:09 - 19:14)
and the other problem was during (19:12 - 19:16)
community day (19:14 - 19:17)
i was completing the test cause it's (19:16 - 19:19)
like catch three charmander (19:17 - 19:21)
but then i was worried about spinning (19:19 - 19:22)
the stops of getting a new (19:21 - 19:25)
task because that would give me an egg (19:22 - 19:27)
and when we started pokemon go we only (19:25 - 19:29)
had the two the five and the (19:27 - 19:31)
ten but now we have the seven and now we (19:29 - 19:32)
have the twelve (19:31 - 19:35)
and we know once you receive the egg (19:32 - 19:37)
so this is why the eggs aren't (19:35 - 19:38)
considered loot boxes even though i (19:37 - 19:40)
think that european law will eventually (19:38 - 19:41)
make it (19:40 - 19:45)
to disclose rates because technically (19:41 - 19:47)
once you get the egg it's all you (19:45 - 19:48)
already know (19:47 - 19:50)
the game already knows what's in it so (19:48 - 19:52)
it's not like it's rolling a roulette (19:50 - 19:53)
wheel (19:52 - 19:55)
when you put it in the incubator when (19:53 - 19:56)
you get the egg (19:55 - 19:58)
the pokemon is already determined at (19:56 - 19:59)
that point when you put it in the (19:58 - 20:02)
incubator you are just seeing what it is (19:59 - 20:03)
and at this point why can't we just (20:02 - 20:05)
throw them away (20:03 - 20:06)
because that would solve a lot of (20:05 - 20:08)
problems like if i specifically want (20:06 - 20:11)
if i know that there's a spooky event (20:08 - 20:12)
coming up (20:11 - 20:14)
and the spooky pokemon are in 5k and i (20:12 - 20:16)
have a bunch of 10k (20:14 - 20:18)
that are probably fee bass but could be (20:16 - 20:19)
dino could be gibble (20:18 - 20:24)
could be uh lola mola i guess (20:19 - 20:24)
i know at least the pool that i'm (20:24 - 20:28)
throwing away from (20:27 - 20:30)
and it could be a shiny dino right like (20:28 - 20:32)
technically shiny dino isn't eggs i (20:30 - 20:33)
don't know that unless i hatch it (20:32 - 20:38)
but let me let me have that conflict of (20:33 - 20:39)
management (20:38 - 20:41)
let me go well i really want the spooky (20:39 - 20:42)
eggs (20:41 - 20:45)
and all i have is a bunch of 10k eggs (20:42 - 20:47)
i'm gonna risk throwing away the 10k (20:45 - 20:49)
eggs for the spooky eggs (20:47 - 20:51)
but what if you could pay to throw away (20:49 - 20:52)
those eggs (20:51 - 20:54)
well i mean that's what incubators are (20:52 - 20:57)
exactly i mean they just want to charge (20:54 - 20:57)
you (20:57 - 20:59)
to make you hatch them i think they're (20:57 - 21:00)
not gonna (20:59 - 21:02)
they're not gonna give you a way to not (21:00 - 21:04)
give them money at this point (21:02 - 21:06)
i i don't even care give me more eggs (21:04 - 21:08)
give me a 15 egg give me a 20k (21:06 - 21:11)
give me a 8k egg give me eggs with (21:08 - 21:13)
different pools but at least let me (21:11 - 21:14)
manage them (21:13 - 21:16)
you can by paying the money for (21:14 - 21:19)
incubators (21:16 - 21:19)
it's problem solved like that's the (21:19 - 21:23)
thing it they're not going to let you (21:22 - 21:25)
throw away eggs (21:23 - 21:29)
because of incubators buying incubators (21:25 - 21:31)
and that's part of what frustrates me (21:29 - 21:33)
about things like this where it again (21:31 - 21:35)
it's just showing you that (21:33 - 21:39)
they are wanting to charge you money (21:35 - 21:41)
but that wasn't that wasn't a problem (21:39 - 21:42)
until the 7k (21:41 - 21:45)
eggs right because prior to that you had (21:42 - 21:47)
no control of what you got from a (21:45 - 21:48)
pokestop you could get a ten you could (21:47 - 21:50)
get a two you could get a five you had (21:48 - 21:51)
no control over that (21:50 - 21:52)
except maybe there were certain events (21:51 - 21:54)
where they would be like they would say (21:52 - 21:54)
like (21:54 - 21:56)
10k eggs are dropping more or 5k eggs (21:54 - 21:59)
dropping more but now they introduced (21:56 - 22:01)
they've introduced two things one is (21:59 - 22:03)
like well when i open gifts i get 7k (22:01 - 22:05)
eggs okay well i have two empty egg (22:03 - 22:07)
slots but i don't want 7k eggs so i (22:05 - 22:08)
guess i can't open any gifts today (22:07 - 22:11)
and now over the weekend where it's like (22:08 - 22:13)
i can't spin a pokestop even though i (22:11 - 22:14)
want more quests (22:13 - 22:16)
i uh because i'm worried about getting (22:14 - 22:18)
an egg but i also want to play like (22:16 - 22:20)
if you are going to introduce these (22:18 - 22:21)
mechanics you (22:20 - 22:24)
you you are now making me (22:21 - 22:28)
dance around your other mechanics (22:24 - 22:31)
to play your game and that's not fun (22:28 - 22:33)
well you mean you're dancing or i'm not (22:31 - 22:34)
paying them money (22:33 - 22:35)
really ultimately that's what you're (22:34 - 22:38)
dancing around i will pay i give them a (22:35 - 22:39)
dollar yesterday i will (22:38 - 22:42)
give the money if things are fun i am (22:39 - 22:44)
not against giving them money i just (22:42 - 22:45)
want things to be fun (22:44 - 22:48)
you're overthinking all of this that's (22:45 - 22:50)
what's destroying your fun (22:48 - 22:53)
just play it as it lies dude get what (22:50 - 22:53)
you get (22:53 - 22:55)
play with your play and just enjoy it (22:53 - 22:58)
12k egg it was red (22:55 - 23:02)
whatever number two let's petition (22:58 - 23:06)
niantic to set up a subscription service (23:02 - 23:09)
where i spend like twenty dollars a (23:06 - 23:09)
month (23:09 - 23:12)
on my pokemon go subscription and i get (23:09 - 23:13)
20 (23:12 - 23:16)
incubators a month how's about that no (23:13 - 23:19)
that's way more money that i pay for an (23:16 - 23:21)
mmo and it's not mmo worthy (23:19 - 23:24)
i still 20 bucks a month 20 10 (23:21 - 23:28)
months okay i (23:24 - 23:30)
don't i i 100 believe that there's a (23:28 - 23:33)
subscription service coming (23:30 - 23:35)
uh i mean we saw that they have a like a (23:33 - 23:36)
minor line in the code that a (23:35 - 23:38)
subscription service is coming that (23:36 - 23:39)
doesn't necessarily mean they'll (23:38 - 23:42)
implement it but if if there was a (23:39 - 23:43)
subscription service coming i bet it (23:42 - 23:44)
would be like (23:43 - 23:46)
7.99 because they seem to really like (23:44 - 23:48)
that price for do you like that price (23:46 - 23:48)
point (23:48 - 23:51)
i don't know why um i bet it would be (23:48 - 23:53)
7.99 (23:51 - 23:55)
and if it gave me one free permanent (23:53 - 23:56)
incubator (23:55 - 23:58)
for the subscription so then i got two (23:56 - 24:00)
permanent incubators i'd actually be (23:58 - 24:02)
really into that hush your mouth no they (24:00 - 24:04)
give us 10 incubators per month (24:02 - 24:06)
or 20 incubators per month that's only (24:04 - 24:08)
that's only like 30 eggs right well i (24:06 - 24:09)
mean that's fine but i would rather have (24:08 - 24:11)
a permanent (24:09 - 24:14)
than like 10 that expire (24:11 - 24:17)
after three uses each i think but you (24:14 - 24:17)
would pay (24:17 - 24:22)
7.99 a month for an extra permanent (24:17 - 24:23)
incubator well i would assume it would (24:22 - 24:25)
come with more i'm just saying that is (24:23 - 24:26)
like the bare minimum (24:25 - 24:28)
give me the incubator but your bare (24:26 - 24:30)
minimum is still (24:28 - 24:35)
one incubator one permanent incubator (24:30 - 24:36)
and don't tell them what your bare (24:35 - 24:38)
minimum is because that's what they'll (24:36 - 24:39)
provide you (24:38 - 24:41)
right what is the least we can give for (24:39 - 24:43)
the money it goes away (24:41 - 24:46)
that is not permanent yeah i mean i (24:43 - 24:47)
guess sure (24:46 - 24:50)
permanent has a subscription no no (24:47 - 24:54)
i mean i want i want rate tickets (24:50 - 24:57)
i want storage i want an extra incubator (24:54 - 24:59)
i want like i don't think storage (24:57 - 25:00)
matters you already you get (24:59 - 25:02)
i mean your storage is permanent i don't (25:00 - 25:04)
think that matters (25:02 - 25:05)
yeah but more of it if i'm gonna pay (25:04 - 25:07)
that much a month no one is gonna need (25:05 - 25:09)
storage in like two months when (25:07 - 25:11)
when you dump this 700 chinese you have (25:09 - 25:14)
and well i just spent 400 coins on 100 (25:11 - 25:18)
more slots because the night before you (25:14 - 25:20)
could have cleared out your inventory (25:18 - 25:22)
but instead you were like that's too (25:20 - 25:23)
much work i'll spend the four dollars if (25:22 - 25:24)
there's (25:23 - 25:26)
one thing i'm not thinking about the (25:24 - 25:28)
night before i'm about to have a (25:26 - 25:28)
fantastic (25:28 - 25:31)
lunch with my friend greg it's storage (25:28 - 25:32)
in pokemon go (25:31 - 25:35)
exactly i was like what cologne am i (25:32 - 25:36)
gonna wear (25:35 - 25:38)
what is my cute little outfit gonna be (25:36 - 25:40)
am i gonna wear socks with my (25:38 - 25:41)
birkenstocks (25:40 - 25:42)
these are the important questions that (25:41 - 25:45)
needed to be addressed choices were made (25:42 - 25:48)
anyways i hatched a scraggy (25:45 - 25:48)
i hatched a larva tar and i probably (25:51 - 26:00)
threw it in the candy chipper bye bye (25:55 - 26:02)
there's some more pokemon go news about (26:00 - 26:03)
grubhub and stuff (26:02 - 26:06)
speaking of ticketed events uh but we're (26:03 - 26:07)
gonna take a break (26:06 - 26:08)
and then we'll be back when we come back (26:07 - 26:10)
we'll talk about the crown tundra (26:08 - 26:14)
this grub hub event and um yeah and (26:10 - 26:16)
this week the crown tundra comes out so (26:14 - 26:25)
we will be right back (26:16 - 26:28)
before we go on is shrek considered good (26:25 - 26:30)
or bad anymore i don't know i can't tell (26:28 - 26:32)
because when shrek came out i definitely (26:30 - 26:34)
like shrek and now i like (26:32 - 26:39)
kind of feel weird i like shrek (26:34 - 26:43)
i definitely like shrek (26:39 - 26:46)
i like shrek (26:43 - 26:46)
i definitely like shrek (26:46 - 26:53)
ally trek (26:49 - 26:55)
i can't tell if people actually like or (26:53 - 26:57)
dislike shrek (26:55 - 27:00)
[Music] (26:57 - 27:08)
i definitely like shrek (27:00 - 27:08)
[Music] (27:09 - 27:15)
we are back niantic has done (27:12 - 27:18)
two updates to mega evolution uh the (27:15 - 27:19)
first one (27:18 - 27:21)
is that when you mega evolve a pokemon (27:19 - 27:22)
it will last (27:21 - 27:24)
per i think these are permanent changes (27:22 - 27:25)
it will work say that now and then (27:24 - 27:26)
they'll be like (27:25 - 27:29)
we looked at those and changed them back (27:26 - 27:31)
we accidentally typoed on our website (27:29 - 27:33)
when you mega evolve a pokemon it will (27:31 - 27:35)
last eight hours instead of (27:33 - 27:37)
four hours again i don't know if that (27:35 - 27:40)
single chain makes anyone feel better (27:37 - 27:43)
[Laughter] (27:40 - 27:45)
the second change is the cap for mega (27:43 - 27:48)
energy has increased from a thousand to (27:45 - 27:49)
two thousand that's just how much you (27:48 - 27:52)
can hold so there were (27:49 - 27:54)
there have been um some people that are (27:52 - 27:56)
very into mega evolution (27:54 - 27:59)
and they hit the candy cap (27:56 - 28:02)
fairly quickly so they have doubled the (27:59 - 28:03)
cap (28:02 - 28:05)
um i don't think i'm that close i think (28:03 - 28:07)
i have the most i have is charizard i (28:05 - 28:07)
think i have like (28:07 - 28:11)
maybe 700 charizard mega candy wow (28:07 - 28:14)
i had 120 i have 300 i think for (28:11 - 28:16)
charizard and that's the most that i (28:14 - 28:19)
have there's not like a good way to like (28:16 - 28:21)
you can't just like search the word (28:19 - 28:24)
mega to like see which pokemon you have (28:21 - 28:26)
mega evolved (28:24 - 28:29)
oh i have 900 charizard candy dang (28:26 - 28:31)
i have mega evolved zero so that's a (28:29 - 28:33)
very easy number for me to look up (28:31 - 28:35)
well anyways those changes happen uh the (28:33 - 28:36)
other thing (28:35 - 28:39)
in pokemon go before we move topics here (28:36 - 28:41)
is there is a (28:39 - 28:44)
pokemon go special weekend presented by (28:41 - 28:45)

used to use them all the time (28:48 - 28:54)

order food what's your first choice (28:56 - 29:01)

bite squad they pretty much (29:03 - 29:08)
bought every other food delivery online (29:04 - 29:11)
company so yeah (29:08 - 29:13)
no i mean bite squad has its own it is (29:11 - 29:14)
it's definitely its own thing (29:13 - 29:16)
i don't get delivery because it's a two (29:14 - 29:18)
mile walk from my apartment to the front (29:16 - 29:18)

please note that shiny unknown will not (31:25 - 31:30)
be appearing during this event (31:28 - 31:31)
i think this is the first time they've (31:30 - 31:33)
come out and said like (31:31 - 31:36)
hey these pokemon are specifically not (31:33 - 31:37)
shiny (31:36 - 31:39)
which is good first time i can recall (31:37 - 31:40)
yeah yeah (31:39 - 31:41)
because there might have been somebody (31:40 - 31:43)
who would want only the shiny unknown (31:41 - 31:44)
from this but (31:43 - 31:47)
they can't be your incense will be (31:44 - 31:51)

uh they are for new and current grubhub (32:15 - 32:18)
plus members (32:17 - 32:21)
trainers uh who are new to grubhub must (32:18 - 32:22)
join the (32:21 - 32:24)
using the link in the email described (32:22 - 32:26)
above they will receive their 14 day (32:24 - 32:27)
free trial (32:26 - 32:29)
i will say as somebody who's gone (32:27 - 32:30)
through most of this progress (32:29 - 32:32)
you do have to give them your credit (32:30 - 32:34)
card if you do forget to cancel after 14 (32:32 - 32:36)
days it's 10 bucks (32:34 - 32:39)
9.99 trainers who are currently grub (32:36 - 32:39)
club (32:39 - 32:42)
grub club grub hub plus members (32:39 - 32:44)
must submit their email address on the (32:42 - 32:46)
special weekend event page (32:44 - 32:48)
by october 28th in order to register (32:46 - 32:50)
tickets will be sent out november (32:48 - 32:53)
4th so two emails i'm sure this is gonna (32:50 - 32:55)
get a lot of questions your first email (32:53 - 32:59)
is to sign up for grubhub (32:55 - 33:03)
plus free trial the second email will be (32:59 - 33:05)
sent out november 4th for your ticket to (33:03 - 33:07)
go (33:05 - 33:09)
um you can only redeem one ticket per (33:07 - 33:10)
account of course (33:09 - 33:14)
only available in the us so there was (33:10 - 33:16)
some clarification from niantic here (33:14 - 33:20)
even though the free trial will end (33:16 - 33:23)
before november 4th if you (33:20 - 33:25)
sign up for the free trial and you (33:23 - 33:27)
cancel like a day later (33:25 - 33:29)
you will still get the ticket you don't (33:27 - 33:31)
have to have an active grubhub (33:29 - 33:33)
subscription to get the ticket you just (33:31 - 33:36)
have to sign up for the free trial (33:33 - 33:41)
so this event costs no money unless (33:36 - 33:44)
you forget to cancel after 14 days then (33:41 - 33:45)
it does cost money (33:44 - 33:48)
and grubhub wins there i guess grubhub (33:45 - 33:49)
wins no matter what because they get (33:48 - 33:51)
your email so (33:49 - 33:53)
we're all the we're all the losers in (33:51 - 33:55)
this in this case now grubhub's pretty (33:53 - 33:56)
good (33:55 - 33:59)
you grabbed melvin nah no (33:56 - 34:01)
care enough you don't want the g's or (33:59 - 34:02)
the h's (34:01 - 34:05)
or the malwales or i the (34:02 - 34:08)
it i had a shiny maw while i gave it to (34:05 - 34:09)
a friend of mine (34:08 - 34:11)
probably a mistake honestly definitely (34:09 - 34:13)
it's not like the shiny rayquaza i gave (34:11 - 34:15)
away that became lucky it wasn't shiny (34:13 - 34:18)
but we didn't do a lucky trade yesterday (34:15 - 34:19)
yep (34:18 - 34:22)
i no i don't first of all i don't know (34:19 - 34:24)
where i'm gonna be on november 8th (34:22 - 34:27)
exactly it's so far in the future it's a (34:24 - 34:28)
sunday (34:27 - 34:32)
which is like recording day but also (34:28 - 34:34)
there's nothing in this that i'm super (34:32 - 34:36)
excited about like (34:34 - 34:40)
haven't g and h been out before yeah (34:36 - 34:42)
yeah so chicago would have been one for (34:40 - 34:43)
h and (34:42 - 34:47)
gg yes (34:43 - 34:50)
that's true i mean so there's nothing in (34:47 - 34:50)
here that i'm (34:50 - 34:53)
super super super excited about doesn't (34:50 - 34:55)
incense (34:53 - 34:57)
incense act is i thought the incense (34:55 - 34:59)
time was staying at an hour anyways (34:57 - 35:02)
yeah i mean but that's like every 20 (34:59 - 35:04)
days niantic extends that so it's just (35:02 - 35:05)
saying like (35:04 - 35:06)
if for whatever reason they don't keep (35:05 - 35:08)
the incense for an hour these will be an (35:06 - 35:09)
hour (35:08 - 35:12)
well my incense yesterday was for three (35:09 - 35:13)
hours during (35:12 - 35:15)
yeah that's coming so i think they're (35:13 - 35:16)
specifically saying hey (35:15 - 35:18)
you don't get community day incense for (35:16 - 35:20)
this event (35:18 - 35:23)
that makes sense i like uh (35:20 - 35:23)
how are they gonna run out of tickets (35:24 - 35:29)
for a virtual event (35:26 - 35:31)
um do you think they just say while (35:29 - 35:32)
supplies last and make people sign up (35:31 - 35:34)
sooner than later (35:32 - 35:37)
probably just that absolutely absolutely (35:34 - 35:38)
they do (35:37 - 35:40)
because what do they i mean grove hub is (35:38 - 35:42)
not like well we only want 100 new (35:40 - 35:44)
people to sign up (35:42 - 35:47)
no more no less no more maybe they do (35:44 - 35:48)
honestly because they don't get the i (35:47 - 35:50)
feel like their problems they don't have (35:48 - 35:53)
enough drivers (35:50 - 35:53)
yeah i don't know you know what's really (35:54 - 35:58)
funny is if you were to listen to the (35:56 - 35:58)
podcast (35:58 - 36:01)
like four years ago when pokemon go came (35:58 - 36:03)
out (36:01 - 36:05)
we were we were because when when (36:03 - 36:06)
pokemon go came out they had the deal (36:05 - 36:08)
with sprint right (36:06 - 36:10)
yeah and then and then the deal was (36:08 - 36:11)
starbucks they had to deal with (36:10 - 36:13)
starbucks and the starbucks deal was (36:11 - 36:14)
only like two months in the us (36:13 - 36:16)
and it was it was it was like every (36:14 - 36:18)
starbucks was a pokestop (36:16 - 36:20)
and if you go into starbucks you could (36:18 - 36:22)
ask for a drink that every barista in (36:20 - 36:24)
the world hated to make (36:22 - 36:26)
um everybody hated to drink because i (36:24 - 36:28)
heard it was bad yeah it wasn't great (36:26 - 36:31)
um and then all the sprints were like (36:28 - 36:32)
defaults (36:31 - 36:34)
gyms and then they were all like default (36:32 - 36:36)
ex raids or whatever (36:34 - 36:38)
and they this i remember sprint giving (36:36 - 36:39)
out the like (36:38 - 36:41)
the the trainer badges of yeah that you (36:39 - 36:43)
could like glue to your (36:41 - 36:46)
denim jacket yeah and at the time (36:43 - 36:48)
we were all like well this is this is (36:46 - 36:50)
pokemon go (36:48 - 36:52)
they're just gonna do event after event (36:50 - 36:53)
after event with different companies (36:52 - 36:55)
and then the sprint deal ended and then (36:53 - 36:56)
the (36:55 - 36:58)
starbucks deal ended and it felt like (36:56 - 37:00)
they didn't do anything (36:58 - 37:03)
well i mean they did a lot of strange (37:00 - 37:04)
things like there have been a number of (37:03 - 37:07)
deals like we just talked about the (37:04 - 37:09)
the weird backpack fashion night yeah (37:07 - 37:11)
they did the backpack they've done (37:09 - 37:13)
a bunch of different weird things and (37:11 - 37:15)
all the starbucks are still (37:13 - 37:18)
gyms in my area yeah i just (37:15 - 37:21)
like this seems like this grubhub event (37:18 - 37:23)
seems like the thing they should have (37:21 - 37:24)
been doing (37:23 - 37:27)
after like ever since the sprint stuff (37:24 - 37:27)
well just (37:27 - 37:30)
nobody plays pokemon go anymore so (37:27 - 37:33)
companies lost interest (37:30 - 37:33)
yeah that's that has to be it i they i (37:33 - 37:37)
mean they they have had events with (37:35 - 37:41)
um both mcdonald's and 7-eleven in japan (37:37 - 37:42)
i think there's like there was a (37:41 - 37:45)
7-eleven event in mexico specifically i (37:42 - 37:47)
think this ferrara seed (37:45 - 37:49)
something to do with ferracid in mexico (37:47 - 37:51)
for 7-eleven or something (37:49 - 37:55)
what are you just making that up yeah no (37:51 - 37:55)
yeah i'm (37:55 - 37:57)
making it all up no but they've had (37:55 - 37:59)
events in other countries (37:57 - 38:02)
specifically japan (37:59 - 38:02)
taiwan's had a couple events right they (38:02 - 38:06)
had the like (38:04 - 38:08)
well those were like festival events i i (38:06 - 38:09)
i would say (38:08 - 38:12)
if this was tied to like (38:09 - 38:15)
food pokemon i would (38:12 - 38:18)
probably be more inclined but you (38:15 - 38:20)
literally did not say (38:18 - 38:23)
you know vanillish once or even a light (38:20 - 38:23)
once (38:23 - 38:26)
right give me (38:23 - 38:28)
like make that the special unique (38:26 - 38:30)
pokemon and i'd be like (38:28 - 38:34)
all over it i'm down but (38:30 - 38:35)
nobody's gonna eat a pharah seed you (38:34 - 38:37)
chip a tooth (38:35 - 38:39)
yeah but it's not a worldwide event so (38:37 - 38:41)
they're kind of like stuck (38:39 - 38:43)
who cares about the rest of the world so (38:41 - 38:44)
i certainly don't (38:43 - 38:48)
the grubhub event is sunday the 8th (38:44 - 38:51)
yeah the mexican event is november 7th (38:48 - 38:54)
the saturday before yeah it's first (38:51 - 38:55)
specifically for mexico right (38:54 - 38:58)
right and that was through 7-eleven (38:55 - 38:59)
correct but (38:58 - 39:01)
here's the part that's getting me right (38:59 - 39:02)
now (39:01 - 39:04)
in order to gain access to this event (39:02 - 39:06)
you need to obtain a ticket by spending (39:04 - 39:07)
more than (39:06 - 39:12)
150 dollars in 7-eleven stores (39:07 - 39:16)
in mexico is that like how (39:12 - 39:18)
it says dollars yeah i was gonna say is (39:16 - 39:20)
it dollars or pesos (39:18 - 39:22)
it says dollars here so i don't know if (39:20 - 39:24)
this is translation error but i'm (39:22 - 39:26)
struggling to think how much is 150 (39:24 - 39:27)
pesos (39:26 - 39:29)
not much it has to be pasted i don't (39:27 - 39:31)
know like back when i lived in dc (39:29 - 39:34)
i used to go to 7-eleven every morning (39:31 - 39:35)
and i'd get like (39:34 - 39:37)
two sodas and a coffee and that was like (39:35 - 39:38)
ten dollars i could (39:37 - 39:41)
like in 17 days i would have done it so (39:38 - 39:44)
150 pesos is about seven dollars and ten (39:41 - 39:46)
cents so it's gotta be it has to be (39:44 - 39:47)
pesos (39:46 - 39:48)
it has to be pesos this has to be a (39:47 - 39:51)
choice yeah because it's the 799 mark (39:48 - 39:53)
i am staring at this struggling to (39:51 - 39:55)
figure out how i spend (39:53 - 39:56)
and fifty dollars you don't know what (39:55 - 39:58)
they sell it's actually seven eleven (39:56 - 40:01)
they could they could they could have (39:58 - 40:02)
they could have like (40:01 - 40:06)
tires at their 7-elevens no (40:02 - 40:09)
that's not how 7-eleven works they have (40:06 - 40:10)
slushies (40:09 - 40:12)
slurpees i don't know what they're (40:10 - 40:15)
called they have slurpees and slim jims (40:12 - 40:17)
they've got doughnuts they've got the (40:15 - 40:19)
simpsons style doughnuts (40:17 - 40:23)
at the 7-eleven and uh (40:19 - 40:23)
cigarettes (40:23 - 40:28)
it has to be pesos it has to be (40:25 - 40:30)
i mean where where are you reading this (40:28 - 40:34)
i am reading this on pokemongohub.net (40:30 - 40:37)
yes once it becomes a dotnet that's us (40:34 - 40:39)
yeah it's super sus i mean i would i (40:37 - 40:41)
don't read spanish (40:39 - 40:44)
so i could go to the 7-eleven page but i (40:41 - 40:46)
have no idea what it's telling me (40:44 - 40:50)
uh oh link me wait (40:46 - 40:54)
hablo espanol (40:50 - 40:54)
i don't know if this is real spanish (41:01 - 41:07)
what do you (41:05 - 41:07)
[Music] (41:12 - 41:16)
upside down exclamation and right side (41:13 - 41:18)
up exclamation just like you do in (41:16 - 41:22)
in spanish (41:18 - 41:22)
it's 150 pesos they use the dollar sign (41:25 - 41:32)
but yes it says buy 150 (41:28 - 41:36)
pesos or more in their stores (41:32 - 41:39)
register your ticket in the app and (41:36 - 41:41)
you gotta get one like one slushy there (41:39 - 41:43)
and you're good you will get (41:41 - 41:46)
an email access code (41:43 - 41:50)
on the 26th of october isn't it slurpees (41:46 - 41:54)
at 7-eleven yeah i think so (41:50 - 41:58)
isn't slurpee just a slushie yes (41:54 - 42:00)
uh no one is slush and the other is (41:58 - 42:01)
slurped so (42:00 - 42:04)
there's clearly a difference okay to (42:01 - 42:06)
make it easy you get your big gulp (42:04 - 42:10)
at the side oh yeah i need 74 ounces of (42:06 - 42:13)
diet coke to get me through my day (42:10 - 42:16)
this is off pokejungle.net details about (42:13 - 42:16)
catching (42:16 - 42:18)
a legendary pokemon and dynamaxx (42:16 - 42:19)
adventure (42:18 - 42:21)
some small news regarding catching (42:19 - 42:23)
legendary pokemon in pokemon sword and (42:21 - 42:24)
shield dlc the crown tundra has been (42:23 - 42:26)
released each legendary pokemon can only (42:24 - 42:28)
be caught by players once (42:26 - 42:30)
but they will have a 100 catch rate this (42:28 - 42:32)
means any type of pokeball can be used (42:30 - 42:33)
without fear (42:32 - 42:34)
while many players are still wondering (42:33 - 42:36)
whether or not these legendaries (42:34 - 42:38)
can appear in shiny form we we do not (42:36 - 42:39)
have the answer for that (42:38 - 42:42)
um they do link a tweet to at play (42:39 - 42:44)
pokemon which is an official pokemon (42:42 - 42:46)
twitter who for some reason tweeted this (42:44 - 42:48)
at like 10 o'clock last night (42:46 - 42:50)
uh which says we've discovered new (42:48 - 42:52)
information about dynamaxx pokemon and (42:50 - 42:53)
the crown tundra while you can only (42:52 - 42:55)
catch one of each legendary pokemon (42:53 - 42:56)
found in dynamics adventures you're (42:55 - 42:57)
guaranteed to catch them (42:56 - 43:00)
if you defeat them um and then it links (42:57 - 43:01)
to the (43:00 - 43:05)
sword shield.pokemon.com page (43:01 - 43:06)
this well i guess they probably tweeted (43:05 - 43:08)
it like late last night because (43:06 - 43:12)
it originally the news broke from a (43:08 - 43:15)
japanese tv show which i think had the (43:12 - 43:17)
japanese voice actor for pikachu (43:15 - 43:19)
i can't remember her name i think it was (43:17 - 43:20)
her that's at least what twitter was (43:19 - 43:21)
saying (43:20 - 43:23)
i don't know if you can trust twitter (43:21 - 43:25)
but so it was it was on the tv show and (43:23 - 43:28)
then several hours later the (43:25 - 43:31)
english twitter tweeted it so i guess (43:28 - 43:32)
that kind of (43:31 - 43:35)
clears up some of the things we talked (43:32 - 43:36)
about (43:35 - 43:39)
last time so well i can only catch one (43:36 - 43:41)
of each legendary pokemon (43:39 - 43:43)
that see that doesn't necessarily so is (43:41 - 43:44)
that the (43:43 - 43:47)
host only or yeah yeah that's not (43:44 - 43:48)
answered (43:47 - 43:50)
yep that's not answered we do get the (43:48 - 43:51)
answer of (43:50 - 43:54)
well it would suck to go through five (43:51 - 43:55)
dynamax (43:54 - 43:56)
and then get to the legendary and then (43:55 - 43:58)
fail and then your friends catch it and (43:56 - 43:59)
you'd be like oh well (43:58 - 44:01)
you know oh it's dinner time i'm super (43:59 - 44:03)
sorry thanks for helping me but (44:01 - 44:05)
good luck with getting that giratina (44:03 - 44:07)
next time (44:05 - 44:11)
so it answers that question uh the (44:07 - 44:13)
catching question was answered of like (44:11 - 44:14)
again getting to the end throwing a (44:13 - 44:16)
premier ball because you only get one (44:14 - 44:18)
ball and then it fails (44:16 - 44:21)
that's answered chinese not answered (44:18 - 44:24)
i mean i bet they lost those are good (44:21 - 44:25)
that they're shiny locked right (44:24 - 44:29)
yeah well who knows (44:25 - 44:32)
i mean they didn't lock wormholes (44:29 - 44:34)
but also you could just save in front of (44:32 - 44:36)
the wormhole you have no way to save in (44:34 - 44:36)
front of this (44:36 - 44:38)
as far as we know right i don't think (44:36 - 44:40)
i'm pretty sure there was (44:38 - 44:43)
i'm pretty sure well you save before you (44:40 - 44:44)
go into the den (44:43 - 44:46)
and then you do the five unless it like (44:44 - 44:48)
lets you save after but (44:46 - 44:50)
but since you have a squad of people (44:48 - 44:52)
right going in with you it's like are (44:50 - 44:54)
you all hitting soft reset at the same (44:52 - 44:55)
time (44:54 - 44:57)
i i say they don't shiny lock it and (44:55 - 44:58)
it's just like (44:57 - 45:00)
it's actually magical to get a shiny (44:58 - 45:03)
again okay so even if they didn't shiny (45:00 - 45:04)
lock it (45:03 - 45:08)
who's doing this who's being like like (45:04 - 45:10)
this is a serious question who you're (45:08 - 45:11)
doing (45:10 - 45:14)
i am not doing this i respect my time (45:11 - 45:15)
way too much if (45:14 - 45:17)
even if they don't shiny lock it who's (45:15 - 45:18)
going through like (45:17 - 45:21)
three to five raid battles (45:18 - 45:23)
and then getting to the end and being (45:21 - 45:25)
like well not shiny and then resetting (45:23 - 45:26)
and then (45:25 - 45:29)
like if you could maybe re keep all the (45:26 - 45:30)
rewards (45:29 - 45:32)
sure because at least you're getting (45:30 - 45:34)
rewarded for the five raid battles and (45:32 - 45:36)
you're stocking up on candy (45:34 - 45:38)
wait wait wait here's something that we (45:36 - 45:39)
haven't considered (45:38 - 45:42)
what if you have the option to not catch (45:39 - 45:44)
like you go through you get to the end (45:42 - 45:46)
and you defeat it and then it says do (45:44 - 45:48)
you want to catch this pokemon or pass (45:46 - 45:50)
this time i mean because you have the (45:48 - 45:53)
option to not catch now that's true (45:50 - 45:57)
so i mean i know what your twitch (45:53 - 45:58)
mondays are going to be (45:57 - 46:01)
no no no no yeah (45:58 - 46:02)
you know how many people come in my chat (46:01 - 46:04)
and they're like are you going to suffer (46:02 - 46:06)
set and so did moon for apopleo (46:04 - 46:07)
no because i respect my time i'm not (46:06 - 46:09)
going to waste 14 minutes (46:07 - 46:11)
yeah listening to sun and moon dialogue (46:09 - 46:12)
to get apopleo (46:11 - 46:16)
to start some weird adventure i (46:12 - 46:19)
i that is i already hate software (46:16 - 46:19)
setting (46:19 - 46:21)
i already think it's a bad way to (46:19 - 46:23)
interact with a video game (46:21 - 46:26)
i was i soft resetted the (46:23 - 46:28)
uh in let's go pikachu let's go eevee (46:26 - 46:30)
for the articuno the zapdos and the mall (46:28 - 46:31)
trace (46:30 - 46:33)
because the at least there was horrible (46:31 - 46:35)
it was like semi-fast (46:33 - 46:38)
and everyone was like super into it but (46:35 - 46:40)
mostly because it was like semi-fast if (46:38 - 46:42)
they had an option in that game to (46:40 - 46:44)
just like run away from the articuno (46:42 - 46:46)
while you stood in front of it (46:44 - 46:48)
i would have probably done that instead (46:46 - 46:51)
i have zero desire to go through (46:48 - 46:54)
a bunch of dialogue to like maybe check (46:51 - 46:55)
if a popular (46:54 - 46:58)
like i'd i would rather masuda and i (46:55 - 47:02)
kind of hate masuda at this point too (46:58 - 47:04)
not the man the method uh you say that (47:02 - 47:05)
now but (47:04 - 47:08)
you have you have broken down many of (47:05 - 47:12)
your former taboos (47:08 - 47:14)
that's true i i like max ray battles (47:12 - 47:15)
because i think they're fine i don't (47:14 - 47:16)
want to do five to get shiny pokemon if (47:15 - 47:17)
i (47:16 - 47:19)
really needed shiny giratina i'll i'll (47:17 - 47:21)
go back to wormhole (47:19 - 47:22)
like if i really need to software set (47:21 - 47:24)
guarana for more i'll do that (47:22 - 47:26)
i don't want to rely on rented pokemon i (47:24 - 47:28)
don't rely on four other people (47:26 - 47:31)
i want dynamax adventure to be fun (47:28 - 47:35)
more than like i want a possible one in (47:31 - 47:36)
4 000 (47:35 - 47:38)
shiny at the end of it where did you (47:36 - 47:39)
trust peop (47:38 - 47:40)
trust issues with other people helping (47:39 - 47:43)
you come from steve (47:40 - 47:43)
twitch (47:44 - 47:46)
i have zero problems in final fantasy 14 (47:48 - 47:53)
finding people who will be willing to (47:51 - 47:55)
run a dungeon (47:53 - 47:58)
15 times to get a horse (47:55 - 48:00)
who wants to spend 20 minutes for one (47:58 - 48:02)
shiny check (48:00 - 48:04)
everybody in your twitch chat that is (48:02 - 48:05)
not true (48:04 - 48:09)
at least four at least three people yeah (48:05 - 48:12)
at least three two one that is probably (48:09 - 48:13)
accurate (48:12 - 48:16)
at least three any time you would easily (48:13 - 48:17)
get three people (48:16 - 48:21)
each time to get into a raid den with (48:17 - 48:22)
you (48:21 - 48:24)
just because people would want to join (48:22 - 48:26)
my raids doesn't mean those same people (48:24 - 48:29)
want to do five raids with me for a (48:26 - 48:30)
single chance of shiny check (48:29 - 48:32)
but you could you would be able to (48:30 - 48:34)
switch it up every time you could do (48:32 - 48:37)
10 runs with three separate people every (48:34 - 48:38)
time and still not (48:37 - 48:39)
run out of people in your chat that (48:38 - 48:42)
wanted to go with you yeah i mean i can (48:39 - 48:45)
i can do raids all night on monday with (48:42 - 48:46)
with whatever raids have existed in (48:45 - 48:48)
sword and shield i have yet to find a (48:46 - 48:49)
shiny that way because (48:48 - 48:51)
the shiny charm doesn't affect raids (48:49 - 48:52)
it's one in four thousand (48:51 - 48:54)
and also i know that each of those raids (48:52 - 48:56)
even if we're playing efficiently and (48:54 - 48:58)
spamming the correct (48:56 - 49:01)
type effectiveness button it still takes (48:58 - 49:03)
the two minutes to line everyone up get (49:01 - 49:05)
everyone in (49:03 - 49:07)
start the raid wait for the dynamax (49:05 - 49:08)
animation to happen (49:07 - 49:11)
wait for the two uh damage checks to (49:08 - 49:14)
happen that whole process still takes (49:11 - 49:16)
like seven minutes of pokemon what else (49:14 - 49:18)
are you doing (49:16 - 49:22)
uh i could be i could be (49:18 - 49:22)
i could be doing stuff you don't know me (49:22 - 49:27)
i could be getting ribbons on my pokemon (49:25 - 49:28)
i could be climbing the competitive (49:27 - 49:30)
ladder i could be (49:28 - 49:33)
i could be cooking weird pokemon foods i (49:30 - 49:36)
could be trying to get a shiner through (49:33 - 49:39)
i could be doing a lot of things i like (49:36 - 49:42)
raids and i like shiny pokemon (49:39 - 49:45)
that just because i like shiny popplio (49:42 - 49:46)
doesn't mean i want to sit through (49:45 - 49:48)
five minutes of dialogue for one shiny (49:46 - 49:49)
check (49:48 - 49:51)
and and one raid is already longer than (49:49 - 49:53)
five minutes of dialogue in sun and moon (49:51 - 49:57)
it's seven minutes also is are we just (49:53 - 49:58)
not assuming the entire raid is shiny (49:57 - 50:00)
locked because if you're walking through (49:58 - 50:01)
and you're doing five raids they already (50:00 - 50:02)
said (50:01 - 50:04)
only one person can catch it and then (50:02 - 50:05)
add it to your team and those are rental (50:04 - 50:06)
pokemon (50:05 - 50:08)
so aren't those going to be locked well (50:06 - 50:09)
they didn't say only one person can (50:08 - 50:11)
catch it they said one person can add it (50:09 - 50:11)
to their team (50:11 - 50:13)
that's they didn't say anything about (50:11 - 50:15)
catching but yeah we don't i guess we (50:13 - 50:17)
don't know if the five (50:15 - 50:19)
pokemon before the i don't know i keep (50:17 - 50:21)
saying five did they confirm most five (50:19 - 50:24)
no it's a number (50:21 - 50:27)
x number two to 20 i don't know (50:24 - 50:29)
we don't know if i'm assuming the ones (50:27 - 50:31)
you catch (50:29 - 50:33)
you do add to your team slash you do (50:31 - 50:34)
just keep them (50:33 - 50:36)
well that's an assumption it may be (50:34 - 50:38)
incorrect (50:36 - 50:40)
it's kind of weird to catch a pokemon (50:38 - 50:42)
that you wouldn't you (50:40 - 50:44)
like you start you start with a rental (50:42 - 50:45)
everything is a (50:44 - 50:47)
rental until the final one that you (50:45 - 50:48)
catch (50:47 - 50:52)
i mean it's it's clear that in this game (50:48 - 50:53)
they put their foot down on software (50:52 - 50:55)
setting they did with the starters (50:53 - 50:58)
they did with type null they did with (50:55 - 50:58)
eternitis (50:58 - 51:01)
zashian zamazenta but you're right you (50:58 - 51:02)
could get to the end (51:01 - 51:04)
you could get the rewards for everything (51:02 - 51:07)
you did and then you could just run away (51:04 - 51:08)
but for all the people being like i hope (51:07 - 51:11)
you can shiny huh (51:08 - 51:11)
did they forget about the first part of (51:11 - 51:15)
the mission (51:13 - 51:18)
no that's the fun part okay we'll see if (51:15 - 51:20)
it's fun i hope it's fun (51:18 - 51:22)
but it's gonna be fun because things (51:20 - 51:24)
that you get to do with your friends are (51:22 - 51:26)
fun well unless you're steve because (51:24 - 51:28)
steve doesn't trust friends (51:26 - 51:30)
he just wants to sit there alone and (51:28 - 51:32)
just rely on himself (51:30 - 51:34)
no what what yeah any game with friends (51:32 - 51:35)
is fun (51:34 - 51:36)
that's why people like mario party (51:35 - 51:37)
because they don't they're not playing (51:36 - 51:41)
it by themselves to get three computers (51:37 - 51:41)
i mean if they if they do decide to lock (51:43 - 51:50)
these pokemon is the statement just (51:46 - 51:52)
go back to older games if you want to (51:50 - 51:54)
shine these i guess this (51:52 - 51:57)
would be or go to pokemon go they are in (51:54 - 51:59)
the business of selling us old games (51:57 - 52:02)
it's not a secret i'm pretty sure the (51:59 - 52:02)
reason that (52:02 - 52:04)
so many people bought crystal was (52:02 - 52:06)
because you could get a celebi in it (52:04 - 52:08)
well and also because it's a fun game to (52:06 - 52:20)
play that's up for debate (52:08 - 52:22)
i want to do dynamics adventure i just i (52:20 - 52:23)
do too (52:22 - 52:26)
i have zero interest in going through it (52:23 - 52:27)
multiple times (52:26 - 52:28)
for the hope of a one in four thousand (52:27 - 52:30)
chance for shiny landorus (52:28 - 52:33)
so this is just a personal issue for you (52:30 - 52:35)
that you don't want it to (52:33 - 52:37)
have shining capability because you feel (52:35 - 52:38)
that would imbu imply (52:37 - 52:41)
imbue some obligation upon you to start (52:38 - 52:42)
doing shiny hunting that way (52:41 - 52:44)
if it if it can be shiny that's cool i'm (52:42 - 52:46)
i'm not to do it though i'll i'll go (52:44 - 52:48)
through i'll catch the landorus and (52:46 - 52:48)
that'll be it (52:48 - 52:51)
fine uh-huh he says that now i that (52:48 - 52:54)
exactly that's exactly my thought (52:51 - 52:57)
i think the thing about um here's here's (52:54 - 52:59)
the difference (52:57 - 53:02)
uh where we're like we the popplio is (52:59 - 53:03)
like five minutes (53:02 - 53:05)
and it's like a lot of in in like sun (53:03 - 53:06)
and moon right (53:05 - 53:07)
if you want to reset for popularity at (53:06 - 53:09)
the beginning it's like five minutes (53:07 - 53:10)
there is like (53:09 - 53:13)
some paying attention to that because i (53:10 - 53:14)
think there's like two questions you (53:13 - 53:15)
have to answer or maybe i'm thinking of (53:14 - 53:17)
x and y and x and y when you're like (53:15 - 53:18)
resetting for (53:17 - 53:20)
chespin or whatever they ask you if you (53:18 - 53:21)
want to be like big p (53:20 - 53:24)
or little d or something like that it's (53:21 - 53:25)
like no both these nicknames are (53:24 - 53:26)
terrible i don't want to be little d (53:25 - 53:28)
or big p but they ask you like two (53:26 - 53:29)
questions (53:28 - 53:31)
whereas like when you're software (53:29 - 53:34)
setting for like wormhole pokemon (53:31 - 53:36)
like ferramosa in the ultra wormhole or (53:34 - 53:38)
your software setting for (53:36 - 53:39)
articuno and let's go pikachu let's go (53:38 - 53:41)
eevee your mind is (53:39 - 53:46)
so not needed for that (53:41 - 53:46)
because it is all it takes what you did (53:48 - 53:51)
for the other one (53:50 - 53:52)
i don't think we have any more details (53:51 - 53:54)
for crown tundra i think that's it (53:52 - 53:57)
that's it i mean will have some next (53:54 - 53:57)
week (53:57 - 54:01)
yeah we'll definitely have some next (53:57 - 54:01)
week (54:01 - 54:03)
the only reason that they came out with (54:01 - 54:05)
this is obviously they listened to this (54:03 - 54:06)
program (54:05 - 54:08)
heard our like hours worth of (54:06 - 54:09)
speculation (54:08 - 54:11)
and they're like oh geez we've got to (54:09 - 54:11)
address this (54:11 - 54:14)
[Laughter] (54:11 - 54:16)
they gotta let us know i have a pokemon (54:14 - 54:17)
go question (54:16 - 54:21)
okay before we get too deep okay okay so (54:17 - 54:23)
the main way i play pokemon go is (54:21 - 54:25)
sending gifts and receiving gifts i (54:23 - 54:26)
think we've (54:25 - 54:28)
established that at this point in time (54:26 - 54:29)
you don't send me gifts (54:28 - 54:32)
i do on the saturdays and sundays that's (54:29 - 54:33)
when you need to be on the lookout for (54:32 - 54:34)
those i've been (54:33 - 54:36)
low gift lately because it's gotten a (54:34 - 54:37)
little cold for bike riding but we're (54:36 - 54:39)
working on that (54:37 - 54:42)
anyways recently (54:39 - 54:46)
the gifts i can't tell if it's all gifts (54:42 - 54:49)
or only some gifts have a pikachu head (54:46 - 54:50)
on them (54:49 - 54:53)
which is new yes what does that mean it (54:50 - 54:55)
means it has a sticker (54:53 - 54:57)
that's what i thought but then somebody (54:55 - 55:00)
else said no that's not what it means (54:57 - 55:02)
i mean it doesn't put stickers on their (55:00 - 55:04)
gifts (55:02 - 55:07)
i sometimes forget great i (55:04 - 55:09)
try but it takes like nothing to hit one (55:07 - 55:10)
button and hit (55:09 - 55:12)
and send a little thank you thank you (55:10 - 55:15)
thank you there are times when i mean to (55:12 - 55:16)
hit the sticker button and i (55:15 - 55:18)
accidentally hit the send button because (55:16 - 55:20)
i'm not paying close enough attention (55:18 - 55:21)
that sounds like shiny hunting (55:20 - 55:24)
you would know it's your career i'm very (55:21 - 55:24)
just i (55:24 - 55:27)
am why do people say this i have shiny (55:24 - 55:29)
hunted like four pokemon and sword and (55:27 - 55:29)
shield (55:29 - 55:33)

you were shiny hunting for like two (55:33 - 55:38)

tag you (58:36 - 58:40)
appreciate it okay this is from andrew (58:37 - 58:42)
in our attic channel (58:40 - 58:45)
uh they have some japanese stuff uh they (58:42 - 58:46)
say (58:45 - 58:48)
the physical giveaway this year at the (58:46 - 58:49)
pokemon movie in japan is going to be a (58:48 - 58:50)
trading card (58:49 - 58:53)
that's not new first time in a while (58:50 - 58:55)
though i think here's the interesting (58:53 - 58:57)
the card is of a human (58:55 - 59:00)
title character of coco uh that's the (58:57 - 59:03)
little boy so unless there's a bit of a (59:00 - 59:04)
twist in the movie (59:03 - 59:05)
that like tarzan like character is (59:04 - 59:08)
really a pokemon in disguise you will be (59:05 - 59:09)
able to battle with a human (59:08 - 59:13)
in the tcg it knows call a forest which (59:09 - 59:15)
lets you search for a grass type pokemon (59:13 - 59:16)
in your deck show it to your opponent (59:15 - 59:18)
and then shuffle your hand (59:16 - 59:21)
and it will know tarzan kick which is a (59:18 - 59:25)
coin toss move 120 damage or nothing (59:21 - 59:27)
three millions of the three million (59:25 - 59:29)
copies of the cards will be produced to (59:27 - 59:30)
be given away (59:29 - 59:33)
i know this shouldn't bother me as much (59:30 - 59:35)
as it does (59:33 - 59:38)
what that the boy is a card yeah like (59:35 - 59:39)
the (59:38 - 59:41)
and not a supporter yeah it's not a (59:39 - 59:42)
supporter it's like a (59:41 - 59:46)
human in their kicking pokemon (59:42 - 59:50)
what happened tarzan actually like is (59:46 - 59:51)
there a twist in tarzan where he's (59:50 - 59:53)
actually a monkey (59:51 - 59:56)
no so (59:53 - 59:58)
the twist is that he's actually rich (59:56 - 60:00)
what really (59:58 - 60:02)
yeah oh yeah the family he was noble (60:00 - 60:04)
yeah (60:02 - 60:06)
it was lost over the jungle like it's (60:04 - 60:07)
it's a (60:06 - 60:09)
really disgusting stereotype of the (60:07 - 60:11)
noble savage yeah i guess (60:09 - 60:13)
i mean if this is the first like (60:11 - 60:15)
non-pokemon attacking thing (60:13 - 60:19)
i guess that's something bothers me (60:15 - 60:22)
i mean there were fossils in the tcg (60:19 - 60:24)
where the fossil would have like 10 hp (60:22 - 60:27)
that's technically just the issue is (60:24 - 60:28)
that it's a human (60:27 - 60:31)
right a human can't be in a pokeball so (60:28 - 60:32)
how do you throw it out (60:31 - 60:35)
to how do you put it in battle how do (60:32 - 60:35)
you (60:35 - 60:39)
how do you be like i have stuffed this (60:35 - 60:42)
child into a pokeball and now it's gonna (60:39 - 60:44)
come out and kick you (60:42 - 60:46)
for 120 that's a pretty good kick well (60:44 - 60:47)
yeah (60:46 - 60:49)
all or nothing though the other thing i (60:47 - 60:50)
want to bring up real quick this is our (60:49 - 60:51)
last bit of news (60:50 - 60:53)
um not a spoiler i don't want anyone to (60:51 - 60:54)
worry i (60:53 - 60:56)
i'm gonna bring up a date of mine but (60:54 - 60:58)
i'm not gonna spoil anything for you (60:56 - 61:00)
i promise crown tundra is so close i (60:58 - 61:03)
wouldn't i wouldn't do this to you (61:00 - 61:05)
there was a data mine though that came (61:03 - 61:06)
out several months ago (61:05 - 61:09)
actually at the same time the armor vial (61:06 - 61:10)
came out and (61:09 - 61:12)
a bunch of data miners saw that there (61:10 - 61:13)
was the (61:12 - 61:16)
framework for the crown tundra so they (61:13 - 61:17)
were able to see the island (61:16 - 61:19)
they were able to see uh the where you (61:17 - 61:21)
could fly to on the island (61:19 - 61:23)
and they were able to see a list of (61:21 - 61:24)
pokemon (61:23 - 61:26)
okay i'm gonna spoil those list of (61:24 - 61:28)
pokemon a lot of legendaries though as (61:26 - 61:30)
we know from the trailers (61:28 - 61:32)
with all of them they've already told us (61:30 - 61:34)
it's all of the legendaries i know not a (61:32 - 61:36)
lot of them (61:34 - 61:38)
all of them all of them spoilers (61:36 - 61:39)
specifically all of them (61:38 - 61:43)
um but in that in the data mine i had a (61:39 - 61:45)
list of all the pokemon that were there (61:43 - 61:48)
uh like altaria nidoking again these (61:45 - 61:50)
pokemon that were shown in the trailer (61:48 - 61:53)
on the tv show we talked about which (61:50 - 61:55)
talked about the dynamax stuff (61:53 - 61:58)
they confirmed that stantler was in (61:55 - 62:01)
the crown tundra which i guess kind of (61:58 - 62:04)
makes sense reindeer snow (62:01 - 62:07)
but here's the twist stantler was not in (62:04 - 62:08)
the data mine (62:07 - 62:11)
interesting either the data mine was (62:08 - 62:12)
wrong (62:11 - 62:14)
well i guess technically the demand of (62:12 - 62:17)
mine is wrong sailing (62:14 - 62:17)
or they've added pokemon since (62:17 - 62:24)
the initial update because right like (62:21 - 62:26)
when they sent out the isle of armor (62:24 - 62:27)
that was just a framework of the crown (62:26 - 62:29)
tundra attached (62:27 - 62:31)
and they haven't they have they've (62:29 - 62:32)
updated the isle of armor they've fixed (62:31 - 62:34)
the hacked raids or whatever but they (62:32 - 62:36)
haven't updated it since (62:34 - 62:38)
even though the data mine shows a (62:36 - 62:39)
hundred (62:38 - 62:42)
or some new pokemon like 30 of those (62:39 - 62:42)
being (62:42 - 62:44)
legendaries stantler was not in the data (62:42 - 62:45)
mine so that's just something (62:44 - 62:47)
interesting to (62:45 - 62:50)
think about as we go into crown tundra (62:47 - 62:52)
so are you saying that there still could (62:50 - 62:52)
be (62:52 - 62:55)
some surprises no what i'm saying is (62:52 - 62:57)
stanler's a legendary pokemon (62:55 - 63:00)
oh oh true i mean (62:57 - 63:04)
you did say all legendaries (63:00 - 63:07)
all of the legendaries (63:04 - 63:10)
all 890 of them every pokemon is (63:07 - 63:11)
legendary (63:10 - 63:14)
yeah well yeah i i i mean i hope crown (63:11 - 63:15)
tundra has some surprises (63:14 - 63:17)
the surprise was friendship the entire (63:15 - 63:19)
time (63:17 - 63:23)
very fair question of the week all right (63:19 - 63:26)
it was the question the question of the (63:23 - 63:28)
week (63:26 - 63:28)
oh i understand very very oriented thank (63:28 - 63:34)

[Laughter] (63:59 - 64:06)

to meet (64:06 - 64:09)
what you two you can do can fill in the (64:07 - 64:11)

him he's just as rare as a shiny pokemon (64:26 - 64:30)
i (64:29 - 64:32)
am so easy to get a hold of what are you (64:30 - 64:33)
talking about uh (64:32 - 64:36)
yeah like they're on his crown you don't (64:33 - 64:39)
go into the channels as much as greg and (64:36 - 64:39)
i do (64:39 - 64:41)
and actually have conversations and (64:39 - 64:44)
discussions and stuff (64:41 - 64:46)
we're just regular folks like everybody (64:44 - 64:48)
else i like music (64:46 - 64:50)
sometimes when i talk in slack i like (64:48 - 64:52)
kill the momentum (64:50 - 64:54)
everybody kills the momentum the memento (64:52 - 64:56)
the momentum in slack (64:54 - 64:58)
is remarkably hard to keep up with and (64:56 - 65:00)
it's very easy to stop (64:58 - 65:02)
i talk i mean i talk in the pokemon go i (65:00 - 65:03)
talk to the masters (65:02 - 65:05)
i mostly post involved those are (65:03 - 65:06)
channels i don't go to (65:05 - 65:09)
yeah i i mostly posting gold i think i (65:06 - 65:11)
was kicked out of gold (65:09 - 65:15)
i mean it's that looks like (65:11 - 65:15)
i didn't i think like first of all like (65:16 - 65:21)
let us know ahead of time (65:19 - 65:24)
i mean if we're at a con or something (65:21 - 65:25)
like (65:24 - 65:28)
when they ever come back often we have (65:25 - 65:28)
things (65:28 - 65:32)
to do there so if you're just (65:28 - 65:35)
catching us at a con and we are going (65:32 - 65:36)
somewhere it's usually because we (65:35 - 65:38)
have some like we just don't have a lot (65:36 - 65:40)
of time but if you can say hey i've got (65:38 - 65:41)
this free time (65:40 - 65:43)
the easiest way is through twitter to (65:41 - 65:44)
say (65:43 - 65:47)
hey i'm going to be here when can we (65:44 - 65:50)
meet up for a chunk of time like (65:47 - 65:54)
any in a sort of con situation like i (65:50 - 65:56)
know especially at gen con i have panels (65:54 - 65:57)
that i'm supposed to be on i have things (65:56 - 65:59)
that i'm supposed to do (65:57 - 66:03)
um so i need to be able to schedule (65:59 - 66:03)
people (66:03 - 66:05)
in otherwise i always feel like if i'm (66:03 - 66:07)
just running into you (66:05 - 66:10)
if i have somewhere to go i i don't want (66:07 - 66:12)
to be rude but also (66:10 - 66:14)
i have a commitment that i have to meet (66:12 - 66:15)
so (66:14 - 66:19)
it's easier if you schedule (66:15 - 66:21)
some sort of time or meeting time or say (66:19 - 66:23)
i'm going to be here for the next (66:21 - 66:24)
whatever (66:23 - 66:26)
i would love to see you and then that (66:24 - 66:27)
can (66:26 - 66:31)
give a structure and i can not feel like (66:27 - 66:34)
i'm watching the clock or you know i'm (66:31 - 66:36)
trying to rush through a conversation (66:34 - 66:37)
because i generally do want to meet (66:36 - 66:39)
pretty much everybody (66:37 - 66:41)
but there are times especially where i (66:39 - 66:43)
tend to meet a lot of people where (66:41 - 66:46)
i am on a schedule and i have to do (66:43 - 66:47)
something and i don't want to (66:46 - 66:49)
shortchange your time i don't (66:47 - 66:51)
want you to feel like we're rushed i (66:49 - 66:52)
would agree with that (66:51 - 66:55)
also uh two pieces of advice um (66:52 - 66:57)
bring a vanguard deck because i cannot (66:55 - 66:59)
step down from a vanguard challenge (66:57 - 67:03)
um or if you play commander (66:59 - 67:05)
it's not that hard to twist greg and (67:03 - 67:06)
mike's arm (67:05 - 67:08)
to throw in for a game of commander yeah (67:06 - 67:10)
well well throw down person commander (67:08 - 67:13)
but also it's like i know (67:10 - 67:17)
like a good portion of our listeners (67:13 - 67:21)
are tend to be more introverted but (67:17 - 67:25)
we we generally are pretty outgoing (67:21 - 67:28)
people and we we're not mean (67:25 - 67:30)
people so like you can come and say hi (67:28 - 67:32)
to us and we're not going to be like get (67:30 - 67:33)
out of my (67:32 - 67:37)
face well he'll just walk by and ignore (67:33 - 67:38)
you (67:37 - 67:40)
but like greg and i will be like come (67:38 - 67:43)
give me a hug (67:40 - 67:48)
[Laughter] (67:43 - 67:51)
when they said that one of us lies they (67:48 - 67:53)
mean the one as in the two of them (67:51 - 67:57)
in a group well because greg and i are (67:53 - 67:59)
basically the same person yes (67:57 - 68:02)
so according to internet we are yes (67:59 - 68:05)
kind of piggyback off greg's thing this (68:02 - 68:08)
is the thing i hate about conventions (68:05 - 68:10)
i'm just going to lay it out here and (68:08 - 68:11)
we've had this happen at like (68:10 - 68:14)
like the dc worlds we've had it happen (68:11 - 68:16)
at like pax (68:14 - 68:19)
uh that we've been to where like a lot (68:16 - 68:20)
of (68:19 - 68:21)
and this is not specific to our (68:20 - 68:24)
community this is like any community (68:21 - 68:25)
where a bunch of people meet up and then (68:24 - 68:27)
there's like this obligation where we (68:25 - 68:28)
all have to do something together (68:27 - 68:30)
specifically maybe (68:28 - 68:33)
like eat together and it is the biggest (68:30 - 68:35)
pain in the world because one there's (68:33 - 68:37)
always like two people in the group of (68:35 - 68:38)
like 10 people (68:37 - 68:40)
that are like oh i can't eat that kind (68:38 - 68:41)
of food (68:40 - 68:44)
or two it's impossible to get a table (68:41 - 68:46)
for like a group of like four or more (68:44 - 68:49)
anywhere and there's like this weird (68:46 - 68:50)
thing where (68:49 - 68:53)
like i don't care like if if if it was (68:50 - 68:54)
like (68:53 - 68:55)
if you guys if you guys want to go (68:54 - 68:57)
somewhere and if it's sushi and (68:55 - 68:58)
something (68:57 - 69:02)
that do it cool like i i don't need to (68:58 - 69:03)
be a part of this or we don't have to (69:02 - 69:04)
like (69:03 - 69:06)
switch it to what i need to do and then (69:04 - 69:08)
all of a sudden there's like 13 people (69:06 - 69:09)
trying to get a table at like (69:08 - 69:12)
a burger place it just makes things (69:09 - 69:13)
really complicated at like conventions (69:12 - 69:14)
when (69:13 - 69:15)
when people like don't want to separate (69:14 - 69:17)
or don't they feel like (69:15 - 69:19)
somebody will be offended if like half (69:17 - 69:21)
the group was like hey we're just gonna (69:19 - 69:22)
get tacos i'd be like (69:21 - 69:25)
yeah do it because uh you'll probably (69:22 - 69:27)
get the tacos (69:25 - 69:29)
30 times faster than us trying to (69:27 - 69:30)
negotiate (69:29 - 69:33)
a restaurant that can serve everyone i (69:30 - 69:34)
mean it's hard to get (69:33 - 69:37)
past the fact that people like having (69:34 - 69:39)
meals (69:37 - 69:41)
like that's a thing that's like a that (69:39 - 69:42)
is like a societal thing (69:41 - 69:46)
eating together is a is a strong bonding (69:42 - 69:48)
thing but it is sometimes incredibly (69:46 - 69:49)
difficult to do (69:48 - 69:51)
but it's not terrible if you can plan it (69:49 - 69:53)
beforehand like (69:51 - 69:56)
we did it for go fest we did it where we (69:53 - 69:56)
like (69:56 - 70:00)
um rented like a fourth of a restaurant (69:56 - 70:02)
but like we did in the last one where (70:00 - 70:04)
y'all met and irene and i went s (70:02 - 70:07)
went and saw the show yeah but that was (70:04 - 70:08)
yeah that wasn't as big as a group of (70:07 - 70:11)
though yeah it wasn't like like for dc (70:08 - 70:13)
worlds i think one of the nights we had (70:11 - 70:15)
14 people for dinner or something weird (70:13 - 70:16)
yeah and it's (70:15 - 70:18)
like a lot spread out over a bunch of (70:16 - 70:19)
tables yeah (70:18 - 70:23)
i mean i also say dinner so meals like (70:19 - 70:24)
that where it's 14 (70:23 - 70:26)
people are probably not the interaction (70:24 - 70:27)
that you're wanting (70:26 - 70:30)
right i would rather be like hey i'll (70:27 - 70:31)
get lunch with you tomorrow (70:30 - 70:33)
i'll get breakfast with you the next day (70:31 - 70:34)
i'll get lunch with you the following (70:33 - 70:36)
day (70:34 - 70:39)
because it just makes it like easier to (70:36 - 70:40)
do (70:39 - 70:44)
um and more personal personable (70:40 - 70:46)
i will say that if you're going to come (70:44 - 70:48)
up and approach (70:46 - 70:50)
one of us but you don't say where you (70:48 - 70:52)
know us from (70:50 - 70:54)
that's an awkward conversation like i (70:52 - 70:56)
don't know why you're coming (70:54 - 70:59)
why why well who are why are you here (70:56 - 71:00)
this is the problem i have with people (70:59 - 71:02)
sending me random offenders requests (71:00 - 71:05)
in pokemon go like if you don't (71:02 - 71:08)
tell me like who who you are (71:05 - 71:11)
what your username is like i i am (71:08 - 71:12)
probably not going to accept that (71:11 - 71:13)
because i have (71:12 - 71:16)
no clue who you are well i've had the (71:13 - 71:17)
problem where (71:16 - 71:20)
people like started to talk to me and i (71:17 - 71:21)
thought they knew me because of this (71:20 - 71:23)
podcast and they actually knew me (71:21 - 71:25)
because of a different podcast and (71:23 - 71:26)
didn't even know i had anything to do (71:25 - 71:26)
with (71:26 - 71:30)
pokemon at all (71:26 - 71:30)
yeah like just let us let's (71:31 - 71:37)
know where you know us from we do (71:34 - 71:40)
multiple projects for multiple reasons (71:37 - 71:43)
like i'm having that like there are (71:40 - 71:45)
people who now only know me because i (71:43 - 71:45)
wrote (71:45 - 71:48)
a role playing game so like (71:45 - 71:52)
just let me know what (71:48 - 71:54)
what avenue of interest brought you to (71:52 - 71:55)
my doorstep (71:54 - 71:58)
so i can have that conversation with you (71:55 - 72:00)
uh the other thing again is not specific (71:58 - 72:02)
to our community (72:00 - 72:05)
but i don't mind hugs (72:02 - 72:08)
but there are definitely people that (72:05 - 72:09)
don't want to be touched (72:08 - 72:12)
so just don't assume that like oh i'm (72:09 - 72:14)
getting to meet you i get to hug you (72:12 - 72:17)
i don't personally mind yeah just ask (72:14 - 72:18)
i'm a hugger (72:17 - 72:19)
but that's like that's my limit like (72:18 - 72:21)
i'll hug but i am not like a super (72:19 - 72:23)
touchy person (72:21 - 72:25)
at all not physically but he's super (72:23 - 72:27)
touchy emotionally you get set back (72:25 - 72:32)
in a minute uh i forgot this last bit of (72:27 - 72:32)
news (72:32 - 72:36)
uh on sunday october 25th from 8 to 10 (72:32 - 72:37)
there will be a (72:36 - 72:40)
drift ghost type event a drift loon in (72:37 - 72:42)
the wild shiny drift loom time to (72:40 - 72:43)
research (72:42 - 72:46)
extra xp when doing nice great or (72:43 - 72:47)
excellent curve throws (72:46 - 72:51)
uh so that'll be from 8 am to 10 p.m (72:47 - 72:52)
i think it'll probably be similar to (72:51 - 72:54)
like the meowth event (72:52 - 72:56)
uh because there will be the exclusive (72:54 - 72:57)
time to research i don't know how many (72:56 - 72:58)
people will be playing (72:57 - 73:00)
since uh it is two days after crown (72:58 - 73:02)
tundra (73:00 - 73:03)
but maybe you don't care about count (73:02 - 73:04)
crown tundra and you care more about (73:03 - 73:05)
pokemon go you know (73:04 - 73:07)
you got something to do that weekend (73:05 - 73:08)
i'll probably do the research (73:07 - 73:10)
it shouldn't be too hard oh you need a (73:08 - 73:12)
break from sitting in front of the (73:10 - 73:14)
tv yeah hopefully the weekend video game (73:12 - 73:17)
it's not like 30 degrees out though (73:14 - 73:19)
i mean are you going to be doing are we (73:17 - 73:22)
doing max right friday or what's the (73:19 - 73:25)
um i don't know what the game plan is (73:22 - 73:27)
for me for crown tundra i guess (73:25 - 73:28)
i probably want to start off just (73:27 - 73:30)
exploring the area (73:28 - 73:32)
i think i want to trade monday yeah yeah (73:30 - 73:34)
for sure max raid's on monday but i want (73:32 - 73:35)
to i think i want to complete the (73:34 - 73:36)
pokedex at first (73:35 - 73:38)
i know i could just transfer all of them (73:36 - 73:39)
in from home but that's no fun i want to (73:38 - 73:40)
catch (73:39 - 73:43)
catch from catch everything from scratch (73:40 - 73:44)
oh i guess the legends though throw a (73:43 - 73:46)
wrench in that because they'll count for (73:44 - 73:47)
the pokedex okay (73:46 - 73:49)
i don't mind moving the legends in (73:47 - 73:50)
because then it doesn't force me to (73:49 - 73:51)
grind out them (73:50 - 73:53)
unless they don't give you anything for (73:51 - 73:55)
completing the pokedex that'll be a (73:53 - 73:56)
bummer (73:55 - 73:58)
maybe you'll get socks in pokemon go (73:56 - 73:59)
wait did isle of armor give you (73:58 - 74:01)
something for completing the isle of (73:59 - 74:03)
armor pokedex yeah you get the uh you (74:01 - 74:04)
get the crown that you can wear and then (74:03 - 74:05)
you get the (74:04 - 74:09)
uh mark charm which increases the chance (74:05 - 74:11)
of getting marks on pokemon (74:09 - 74:14)
ugh i guess i gotta start playing isle (74:11 - 74:15)
of armor again (74:14 - 74:17)
can wear that cool crown i ain't (74:15 - 74:19)
changing my clothes (74:17 - 74:21)
pokemon of the week oh are we here (74:19 - 74:22)
already all right (74:21 - 74:24)
last week's pokemon it was super easy (74:22 - 74:25)
it's a fruit (74:24 - 74:29)
it starts with b (74:25 - 74:32)
and it's not one that you would (74:29 - 74:36)
typically find in uh especially the (74:32 - 74:38)
united states the first time i ever (74:36 - 74:39)
encountered one i was (74:38 - 74:42)
in uh the middle east i was in qatar (74:39 - 74:43)
staying in the four seasons hotel and (74:42 - 74:45)
every thursday night they used to give (74:43 - 74:46)
me (74:45 - 74:49)
a nice tray of sweet things to eat (74:46 - 74:52)
and this was included i bit into it not (74:49 - 74:52)
realizing (74:52 - 74:56)
that the rind is basically (74:52 - 74:59)
wood and you have to kind of cut it in (74:56 - 75:02)
half to actually get to the fruit part (74:59 - 75:07)
which pokemon is it it's (75:02 - 75:07)
bonsai i mean that does start with b he (75:07 - 75:11)
does (75:10 - 75:14)
i mean i was expecting you to say banana (75:11 - 75:15)
uh (75:14 - 75:18)
aren't you glad i didn't say today is (75:15 - 75:20)
the trophies (75:18 - 75:23)
uh it's bone sweet bound (75:20 - 75:28)
sweet yes based on the mangosteen i did (75:23 - 75:32)
not realize that the shiny (75:28 - 75:34)
uh was had the purple top that's super (75:32 - 75:35)
cute (75:34 - 75:37)
i never look at the shinies until you (75:35 - 75:40)
mention them (75:37 - 75:42)
i wanted a sarina shiny because i like (75:40 - 75:44)
it but i didn't realize that its little (75:42 - 75:47)
top is purple (75:44 - 75:49)
oh man serena is absolutely one of my (75:47 - 75:50)
favorite pokemon (75:49 - 75:53)
i think like i played through ultra moon (75:50 - 75:55)
because of uh (75:53 - 75:59)
queen's majesty is such a great move (75:55 - 76:02)
or ability i also love that (75:59 - 76:05)
doesn't serene only evolve if uh (76:02 - 76:08)
certainly no stop stop and that one (76:05 - 76:10)
other things (76:08 - 76:13)
it's such a good little thing (76:10 - 76:13)
nice little like it's appealing to (76:14 - 76:18)
somebody (76:16 - 76:21)
queenly majesty that is such a great (76:18 - 76:23)
move i mean ability why are you keep (76:21 - 76:24)
saying move (76:23 - 76:27)

no (76:47 - 76:50)
that is a water bug it's true uh (77:04 - 77:10)
bond sweep may be based on a purple (77:07 - 77:12)
mangosteen (77:10 - 77:17)
mangosteens come in other colors i guess (77:12 - 77:18)
i mean it's really tasty if you can find (77:17 - 77:20)
yourself a mangosteen number one don't (77:18 - 77:22)
bite into it (77:20 - 77:24)
to get the actual fruit out and number (77:22 - 77:26)
two enjoy it (77:24 - 77:28)
i have always been interested in trying (77:26 - 77:29)
one but again (77:28 - 77:32)
i don't i can't get them here easily and (77:29 - 77:33)
i've not (77:32 - 77:36)
like sought them out what is the (77:33 - 77:39)
is there no opposite line to this (77:36 - 77:39)
because (77:39 - 77:42)
this line is 100 female usually there's (77:39 - 77:45)
a 100 male line to compliment it (77:42 - 77:46)
i don't think there was one in sun and (77:45 - 77:50)
moon i don't think so (77:46 - 77:52)
interesting all right this week's (77:50 - 77:55)
pokemon which greg has already ruined (77:52 - 78:00)
i didn't but not really (77:55 - 78:00)
he just ruined what i wrote oh (78:00 - 78:06)
all right here we go yesterday during (78:03 - 78:08)
pokemon go char cha cha (78:06 - 78:11)
community day i was checking for shinies (78:08 - 78:12)
when i noticed (78:11 - 78:15)
i was being invited to a remote raid by (78:12 - 78:17)
nathan in indianapolis (78:15 - 78:18)
curious to whether this would be a (78:17 - 78:21)
sought after mega evolution or giratina (78:18 - 78:23)
i opened the raid and was immediately (78:21 - 78:25)
disappointed (78:23 - 78:27)
why would someone invite me to a remote (78:25 - 78:30)
raid for that pokemon i asked greg (78:27 - 78:33)
isn't it available in the wild i think (78:30 - 78:35)
you can get it in eggs greg said (78:33 - 78:37)
all i have gotten and eggs for the past (78:35 - 78:41)
two weeks is (78:37 - 78:44)
and i got another one today i entered (78:41 - 78:46)
the remote raid anyways and (78:44 - 78:48)
even though this pokemon is the first in (78:46 - 78:50)
its evolutionary line (78:48 - 78:53)
appearing in a one-star raid i was still (78:50 - 78:55)
surprised at how quickly it was defeated (78:53 - 78:58)
so quickly in fact its hp bar still (78:55 - 79:00)
showed half health even though it (78:58 - 79:03)
had been fainted this fighting type (79:00 - 79:06)
pokemon one of unova's finest (79:03 - 79:08)
would love to help you build your home (79:06 - 79:10)
and shares its name with the non-held (79:08 - 79:12)
item that it holds (79:10 - 79:14)
