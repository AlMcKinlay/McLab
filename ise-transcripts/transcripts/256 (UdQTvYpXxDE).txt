magic card (2:42 - 2:45)
[Applause] (2:45 - 2:49)
this is working out pretty well hey I (2:47 - 2:50)
mean you gotta start at the beginning (2:49 - 2:53)
right now question is why is pokemon (2:50 - 3:00)
snap the best pokemon game I would just (2:53 - 3:03)
say because it's wonderful no that was (3:00 - 3:05)
good I didn't nail it I didn't nail it (3:03 - 3:07)
we'll do it again no cuz I already (3:05 - 3:10)
failed once no all I know like all I (3:07 - 3:13)
know about pokemon snap is I borrowed it (3:10 - 3:15)
from like a video store one time and (3:13 - 3:16)
kept it overnight and returned it the (3:15 - 3:18)
next day and that was asked you know (3:16 - 3:23)
congratulation was a riveting story I (3:18 - 3:26)
recently played pokemon i think we all (3:23 - 3:28)
like look at pokemon snap and the fact (3:26 - 3:30)
that it was so good back then and i (3:28 - 3:31)
don't know how many of you recently (3:30 - 3:33)
applied it or whatnot but I'm Italy feel (3:31 - 3:35)
great and there's nothing bad about any (3:33 - 3:37)
of it because it's all perfect all the (3:35 - 3:39)
time let me tear it apart right now no (3:37 - 3:41)
no I will not allow view I recently (3:39 - 3:43)
played it with with my girlfriend Irene (3:41 - 3:45)
we streamed it and it was her first time (3:43 - 3:47)
actually playing it and the entire time (3:45 - 3:50)
I couldn't help but think man this game (3:47 - 3:54)
really holds up its really great and (3:50 - 3:56)
there are just a lot of little things (3:54 - 3:58)
that they do and just seeing Pokemon in (3:56 - 4:00)
motion and in that way where you're just (3:58 - 4:01)
not seeing them in combat like in sun (4:00 - 4:04)
and moon is is just really not inspiring (4:01 - 4:07)
but it's like delightful wait so have (4:04 - 4:09)
you done the the picture-taking in sun (4:07 - 4:12)
and moon it's not it's good enough for (4:09 - 4:14)
me oh it's like yeah have you haven't (4:12 - 4:16)
been taking your pictures inside a moon (4:14 - 4:18)
do it it's fine you get likes from (4:16 - 4:20)
imaginary people which I had the (4:18 - 4:21)
weirdest part of me I'll take whatever (4:20 - 4:23)
people i can get and then also those (4:21 - 4:25)
imaginary people sometimes don't like (4:23 - 4:26)
your pictures sometimes they (4:25 - 4:28)
specifically dislike what you take and (4:26 - 4:32)
that is hurtful the second vote for a (4:28 - 4:37)
pokemon is sighed duck good one yeah (4:32 - 4:39)
imma show I'd be like sorry I but I (4:37 - 4:41)
don't do voices yeah we did say that (4:39 - 4:42)
these questions didn't have to be (4:41 - 4:44)
pokemon related this question is do you (4:42 - 4:47)
play stardew valley yes (4:44 - 4:51)
yeah I love how like cheery you guys are (4:47 - 4:54)
great what about the two of you I (4:51 - 4:56)
certainly do what about the two night I (4:54 - 5:00)
do not play farm simulators no aah (4:56 - 5:02)
stardew valley is really great and if (5:00 - 5:04)
you haven't played that you should I (5:02 - 5:05)
know it's coming to nintendo switch (5:04 - 5:09)
which is really exciting yeah I can make (5:05 - 5:12)
who did you marry who did I marry I was (5:09 - 5:14)
it happen Gail abigail was like the (5:12 - 5:17)
gamer the gamer chick yeah I married (5:14 - 5:20)
what's her name Emily the one who likes (5:17 - 5:23)
like crystals and sewing and stuff oh (5:20 - 5:27)
alright you know I mean you picked wrong (5:23 - 5:31)
but that's okay a third vote here is (5:27 - 5:37)
ammonite oh no no interest no wood he's (5:31 - 5:42)
like like squishy a question is would (5:37 - 5:46)
you play a Pokemon d indeed yes and we (5:42 - 5:50)
have is the thing Travis do you want to (5:46 - 5:53)
explain yeah our D&D show you sure that (5:50 - 5:55)
wasn't it was some organic buzz (5:53 - 5:57)
marketing that just happened there well (5:55 - 5:58)
we have a side show called mythical (5:57 - 6:00)
where we play Dungeons and Dragons but (5:58 - 6:03)
in a medieval magical Pokemon setting (6:00 - 6:05)
it's as weird as it sounds but it's a (6:03 - 6:12)
lot of fun yeah it's alright it's (6:05 - 6:15)
alright so if you're in a Pokemon DD (6:12 - 6:16)
what like Travis said we do a show (6:15 - 6:18)
called mythical the cool thing about it (6:16 - 6:20)
is we have three seasons we have season (6:18 - 6:23)
11 and a half in season two and they're (6:20 - 6:25)
all contained in its own thing so you (6:23 - 6:26)
don't have to start at season one you (6:25 - 6:29)
get to like listen to season two you (6:26 - 6:30)
could start at season two and then go (6:29 - 6:32)
back they're all there contain stories I (6:30 - 6:35)
think of a lot like Game of Thrones in (6:32 - 6:36)
this aspect of like an episode of (6:35 - 6:38)
getting through just as good there's a (6:36 - 6:41)
lot of a lot of murder no in an episode (6:38 - 6:42)
of Game of Thrones you can like they (6:41 - 6:45)
they pan to different people so a whole (6:42 - 6:47)
episode could be focused on Jon Snow and (6:45 - 6:50)
then maybe in you know 3 episode 3 (6:47 - 6:51)
episodes you won't get any job snow and (6:50 - 6:53)
then he comes back so that's kind of (6:51 - 6:54)
we think of mythical and the fact that (6:53 - 6:57)
this story is contained here in this (6:54 - 6:59)
season but if you wanted more of that (6:57 - 7:01)
then you can go back and listen to other (6:59 - 7:04)
seasons Oh supposed to be accessible so (7:01 - 7:06)
you can jump in already the next one (7:04 - 7:09)
then you guys can cool jump in we had a (7:06 - 7:15)
vote for vaporeon put all these gen one (7:09 - 7:17)
Pokemon the question is do you rock out (7:15 - 7:24)
to the album to be a master we all live (7:17 - 7:27)
in a Pokemon world yeah I think it's (7:24 - 7:29)
clear i said i don't remember the next (7:27 - 7:31)
verse oh i don't remember anything from (7:29 - 7:35)
to be a master now i'm being honest that (7:31 - 7:38)
was good out ah yeah sure so i can read (7:35 - 7:40)
a question we have another vote for (7:38 - 7:42)
psyduck good choice and then the (7:40 - 7:44)
question and i'll explain in a bit the (7:42 - 7:46)
question is what do you think of smogon (7:44 - 7:49)
cheering so smogon is a part of the (7:46 - 7:52)
pokemon competitive scene where it's (7:49 - 7:57)
sort of a community for people to battle (7:52 - 7:58)
against each other with the pokemon (7:57 - 8:01)
games competitively and so in order to (7:58 - 8:02)
facilitate that they've ordered Pokemon (8:01 - 8:07)
in two different tier structures so the (8:02 - 8:09)
ones that get used the most get stuck in (8:07 - 8:11)
the uber tier and then there's over used (8:09 - 8:12)
under that under used and it goes down (8:11 - 8:14)
like that to facilitate different (8:12 - 8:17)
formats to play with so that you end up (8:14 - 8:20)
seeing more pokemon in the structures at (8:17 - 8:21)
least that's the that's the hope and I (8:20 - 8:24)
think it worked pretty well I know it's (8:21 - 8:27)
controversial because it you know it's (8:24 - 8:28)
not an official because it's not real (8:27 - 8:30)
VGC because yeah because it's not an (8:28 - 8:32)
officially sanctioned format but I mean (8:30 - 8:35)
I people have fun with it so that's kind (8:32 - 8:36)
of all that matters and I think it does (8:35 - 8:38)
do a good job and facilitate it because (8:36 - 8:42)
you're not going to see like you know (8:38 - 8:43)
you're not going to see a charge a bug (8:42 - 8:45)
and well actually you're not going to (8:43 - 8:47)
see like there are a lot of focalin that (8:45 - 8:48)
you just wouldn't see in the efficacy (8:47 - 8:51)
format Brett yeah you wouldn't see a fur (8:48 - 8:52)
in the official VGC format because it's (8:51 - 8:55)
not allowed well with that attitude I (8:52 - 8:58)
guess my only problem with smogon (8:55 - 9:00)
tiering is when people then come to a (8:58 - 9:02)
VGC competition and don't understand (9:00 - 9:03)
that the smogon rules don't apply (9:02 - 9:05)
anymore so you can put (9:03 - 9:07)
your opponents to sleep and stuff like (9:05 - 9:08)
that but you know you'll learn (9:07 - 9:10)
eventually will you want to read one (9:08 - 9:12)
well I don't I need to call a judge on (9:10 - 9:14)
this because somebody voted for Cabral (9:12 - 9:16)
ER but I thought controller was bitter (9:14 - 9:19)
fighting just fighting so how it (9:16 - 9:22)
swallowed by this very mad what was the (9:19 - 9:23)
question though the question is best (9:22 - 9:25)
generation of Pokemon games generation (9:23 - 9:31)
five all right Steve well yeah I like (9:25 - 9:37)
gin too i would say JJ yeah I it I want (9:31 - 9:39)
to say sun and moon because I love those (9:37 - 9:41)
games a ton but I don't know if they're (9:39 - 9:43)
gonna hold up like gin to definitely (9:41 - 9:44)
held up and heartgold soulsilver is (9:43 - 9:48)
easily like one of the best games yeah (9:44 - 9:50)
to recommend to people yeah i would say (9:48 - 9:51)
whatever's going to follow Sun and Moon (9:50 - 9:54)
will probably be really amazing but then (9:51 - 9:56)
to doesn't have volcarona so it's (9:54 - 10:00)
garbage we gotta vote for squirtle I (9:56 - 10:02)
[Applause] (10:00 - 10:05)
love this question because it says what (10:02 - 10:06)
is the best and then best is scribbled (10:05 - 10:08)
out and then it says what is the worst (10:06 - 10:17)
school typing ooh uh ground water don't (10:08 - 10:22)
stop hating on gaston great um I don't (10:17 - 10:25)
four times a week to grass that is a bad (10:22 - 10:28)
thing to have um probably Oh probably a (10:25 - 10:30)
bomb snows typing right probably I mean (10:28 - 10:32)
I love iced I love ice type Pokemon it's (10:30 - 10:36)
a Christmas tree correct I love (10:32 - 10:38)
Abomasnow and I love ice types but (10:36 - 10:40)
having ice and grass is just asking for (10:38 - 10:43)
trouble your week to virtually (10:40 - 10:45)
everything but i think they determined (10:43 - 10:47)
that it's grass bug is like the worst (10:45 - 10:49)
right paris is like the paris act is the (10:47 - 10:51)
worst yeah that's a bad one too yes (10:49 - 10:53)
weaknesses and you have dry skin as well (10:51 - 10:54)
because so you're even more weak to (10:53 - 10:56)
fight yep because if you didn't just (10:54 - 10:58)
didn't get enough we fire with an essay (10:56 - 11:02)
at it on top yeah alright want me to go (10:58 - 11:05)
yep sidra vote procedure that's the (11:02 - 11:07)
first we've seen that one jeonhwa no gym (11:05 - 11:11)
to know what maybe gen 3 (11:07 - 11:13)
you're fired what do you think draw (11:11 - 11:15)
there you go that's what I was like yeah (11:13 - 11:17)
what do you think about evolution items (11:15 - 11:22)
in Pokemon go yeah the ones you can only (11:17 - 11:23)
get for like seven days in a row and (11:22 - 11:27)
stop yeah I haven't gotten any uh I (11:23 - 11:30)
think yeah evolution I don't understand (11:27 - 11:34)
why like the gimmick to EV is just give (11:30 - 11:37)
it a nickname why is there just not (11:34 - 11:42)
stones for that and well like pollito (11:37 - 11:46)
does Kings rock felix is metal coat (11:42 - 11:49)
right yep so no I think those are fine I (11:46 - 11:51)
guess yeah they're fine ah my problem is (11:49 - 11:55)
the EVC as yeah yeah I think that's a (11:51 - 11:56)
good point the problem is the (11:55 - 11:59)
inconsistency right but they don't all (11:56 - 12:01)
work like that the ones that do require (11:59 - 12:05)
items in the games we go in me next or (12:01 - 12:08)
do not it's a vote for gear dose we had (12:05 - 12:11)
a vote for magic card before so this is (12:08 - 12:13)
what is the worst pokemon we're really (12:11 - 12:16)
negative today folks what is this basis (12:13 - 12:18)
design what is the worst pokemon design (12:16 - 12:22)
yeah the worst pokemon design Mary Ellen (12:18 - 12:25)
everyone's gonna hate me no no the car (12:22 - 12:28)
goes fine bad it's just a bad Pokemon (12:25 - 12:34)
yes that's not bad not not winning a lot (12:28 - 12:36)
of fans with with our responses (12:34 - 12:38)
developed so far ah no but i would say (12:36 - 12:40)
Bascom ones probably one of the poorest (12:38 - 12:44)
design pokeman i got you beat Nick rajma (12:40 - 12:47)
what is that thing it's like I was black (12:44 - 12:51)
in hock Roach laser / airplane I guess (12:47 - 12:54)
stealth bomber maybe yeah if you haven't (12:51 - 12:56)
gotten your Nick rosman at its up in the (12:54 - 12:59)
volcano Mountain place yeah Ken Caryl (12:56 - 13:02)
Harry Hill I used to live in Hawaii I (12:59 - 13:06)
can't even get these things right we (13:02 - 13:09)
gotta vote for Asha wat (13:06 - 13:13)
agreed what was better mega evolution or (13:09 - 13:18)
Z moves I'm gonna actually say Z moves (13:13 - 13:22)
because I think so mega evolutions were (13:18 - 13:25)
cool and they allowed for new Pokemon (13:22 - 13:27)
designs which is great but i think that (13:25 - 13:30)
mega evolution as a mechanic was kind of (13:27 - 13:32)
underwhelming because it was it was (13:30 - 13:34)
never strategic there are very very few (13:32 - 13:37)
instances where it was strategic to not (13:34 - 13:39)
immediately mega evolve right like (13:37 - 13:42)
you're not going to there are very few (13:39 - 13:43)
occasions where it's more advantageous (13:42 - 13:47)
to stay the base Pokemon and not mega (13:43 - 13:48)
evolve where there are a lot of (13:47 - 13:51)
instances where hiding the fact that you (13:48 - 13:53)
have a Z move throughout the match would (13:51 - 13:56)
be advantageous so I think it opens more (13:53 - 13:59)
strategic possibility but I first risk (13:56 - 14:00)
reveals a Z move right because you have (13:59 - 14:04)
to hold the Z stone great I yeah yes it (14:00 - 14:06)
would but I mean it requires that your (14:04 - 14:08)
opponent run a Pokemon with risk now (14:06 - 14:12)
orvis the other one the ability anyways (14:08 - 14:13)
mega Mawile is one of my absolute (14:12 - 14:14)
favorites so I'm gonna go with mega (14:13 - 14:17)
evolution I actually won VGC matches (14:14 - 14:22)
with mega Mawile so go on Alex he moves (14:17 - 14:24)
better I think mega evolutions are cool (14:22 - 14:27)
and I'm glad they kept them I've said (14:24 - 14:29)
this on the show before but mega (14:27 - 14:31)
evolutions was a way to give us more (14:29 - 14:33)
Pokemon without padding that pokedex (14:31 - 14:36)
number right because mega charizard the (14:33 - 14:41)
17 mega Charizard they made their still (14:36 - 14:44)
under Charizard number so I thought that (14:41 - 14:47)
was a nice way of giving us a quote (14:44 - 14:49)
unquote fourth evolution but also not (14:47 - 14:52)
patting the Polka deck or not increasing (14:49 - 14:53)
the pokédex number I like that what they (14:52 - 14:55)
did that they did it with a lowland (14:53 - 14:57)
forums I like the way that yeah that's (14:55 - 14:59)
another like way of not increasing the (14:57 - 15:01)
next number is it my turn or wills I (14:59 - 15:03)
can't even remember I want to go next oh (15:01 - 15:05)
is this gonna be easy magic card gets (15:03 - 15:08)
another vote aight this is going to (15:05 - 15:11)
cause a lot of your angst your top 10 (15:08 - 15:12)
people but aaron we're gonna have a lot (15:11 - 15:14)
of eggs on the panel for my solution my (15:12 - 15:16)
next question is also negative so we're (15:14 - 15:18)
really packing them in right (15:16 - 15:23)
no but anyways biggie or Tupac so the (15:18 - 15:26)
problem is it's real easy for me I have (15:23 - 15:27)
yeah I lived in Hawaii for a little (15:26 - 15:29)
while but I'm like an East Coast dude so (15:27 - 15:31)
big E all the way but these two are from (15:29 - 15:33)
the midwest they're like right on the (15:31 - 15:37)
line I would probably say biggie mmm I'm (15:33 - 15:39)
gonna keep things neutral Switzerland (15:37 - 15:42)
over here well that means biggie wins (15:39 - 15:46)
yeah we have a vote from Lapras which i (15:42 - 15:49)
think is a good good vote and then the (15:46 - 15:51)
question is what is the most over rated (15:49 - 15:56)
Pokemon I would again pause it Lucario (15:51 - 15:56)
yeah most overrated Pikachu now just (15:56 - 16:04)
thought I knew it by just nick ality (16:02 - 16:06)
Pikachu has earned every place it needs (16:04 - 16:10)
to be Pikachu has grown as a person like (16:06 - 16:16)
I Lucar is probably one of my least (16:10 - 16:18)
favorite pokemon but I totally get why (16:16 - 16:20)
people like Lucario and I connect you (16:18 - 16:24)
want to do and it did things for the (16:20 - 16:27)
franchise that other Pokemon didn't do (16:24 - 16:29)
if it was it's not like a Pikachu but (16:27 - 16:32)
like Lucario i would say falls under the (16:29 - 16:34)
same category that Charizard does of (16:32 - 16:36)
everyone knows it and they definitely (16:34 - 16:39)
tried to put zoroark in that place and (16:36 - 16:41)
zoroark is amazing Noah's Ark fail which (16:39 - 16:44)
is that are cooler than Lucario well (16:41 - 16:46)
they got my shirt and show you my (16:44 - 16:49)
zoroark tattoo no thank you let's go not (16:46 - 16:50)

hippos eat (17:09 - 17:14)
they eat little white spheres right (17:11 - 17:18)
hungry hungry hippo hi I believe hippos (17:14 - 17:20)

best design and it's got a really cool (19:56 - 20:00)
shiny I always okay so i'm i'm pretty (19:58 - 20:02)
confident I'm Brianna and SPN are always (20:00 - 20:06)
frontrunners we get a cheer for umbreon (20:02 - 20:06)
all right what about SPM so I can't tell (20:07 - 20:14)
it sounds pretty identical pretty even (20:13 - 20:17)
it's always neck and neck I we gotta (20:14 - 20:21)
vote for greninja decent weight regular (20:17 - 20:23)
greninja or ash no no there's no ash (20:21 - 20:25)
here as there should it be which was the (20:23 - 20:33)
one yr the professor so hot hmm I mean (20:25 - 20:36)
all professors Burt's just gets me good (20:33 - 20:39)
I would rather just not question this (20:36 - 20:41)
great gift were given and every single (20:39 - 20:43)
Pokemon get like why question it and (20:41 - 20:45)
ruin the possibility of not getting (20:43 - 20:51)
another one I have no answer i just (20:45 - 20:53)
sorry I googling images images of (20:51 - 20:56)
Professor Kakui I was distracted by (20:53 - 21:00)
completely all right i got 1 a slow bro (20:56 - 21:04)
gotta vote for so gross ok strangely (21:00 - 21:07)
enough i don't know how to answer this (21:04 - 21:08)
question so I'm gonna have to rely on (21:07 - 21:12)
you guys why doesn't Dunsparce evolve (21:08 - 21:16)
into grandpa it would be perfect yeah I (21:12 - 21:20)
don't Dunsparce isn't a dragon but it (21:16 - 21:24)
could be not with that attitude yeah I (21:20 - 21:28)
think Dunsparce is already like tied to (21:24 - 21:29)
some sort of Japanese yeah fairy (21:28 - 21:32)
creature so but it's normal type not (21:29 - 21:38)
fairy yet so I like the the fact that (21:32 - 21:41)
there are pokemon that look like each (21:38 - 21:44)
other but they're not related you got (21:41 - 21:46)
your bouffalant sand yeah you got your (21:44 - 21:49)
love dis wanna be one your elements yeah (21:46 - 21:52)
I think that's okay I mean it's like if (21:49 - 21:54)
they did it for one Pokemon it be (21:52 - 21:56)
frustrating but they do it to enough (21:54 - 21:57)
that it's like all right and I see where (21:56 - 21:59)
you're going just sort of echoing back (21:57 - 22:02)
yeah ma so the we have a vote for (21:59 - 22:04)
greninja which is what we just got right (22:02 - 22:06)
regular green ninja or a skirt it's (22:04 - 22:09)
nobody vote for ash greninja a ninja and (22:06 - 22:10)
then the question is if you could make a (22:09 - 22:13)
Pokemon what would it look like what (22:10 - 22:15)
would its tight be and what would its (22:13 - 22:18)
signature move to how that's so but give (22:15 - 22:21)
us half an hour I gotta come back I (22:18 - 22:23)
don't think they've done this but what (22:21 - 22:28)
if it was an ice cream cone yeah I'm (22:23 - 22:29)
interested (22:28 - 22:32)
you got my attention really outside the (22:29 - 22:36)
box with that hmm I would want to see an (22:32 - 22:39)
actual kangaroo pokemon that isn't (22:36 - 22:41)
kangaskhan because kangaskhan is no (22:39 - 22:46)
bueno oh but I want to see like a slim (22:41 - 22:51)
and thick kangaroo with boxing gloves (22:46 - 22:54)
okay you're totally cheating because we (22:51 - 22:55)
have been discussing that in our (22:54 - 22:57)
community for like past two weeks k (22:55 - 22:59)
display talkin like is that the one with (22:57 - 23:02)
the kangaroo okay I got confirmation (22:59 - 23:04)
from themselves if that is the Ganga (23:02 - 23:06)
river the chaos in like Oracle of Ages (23:04 - 23:08)
or sometimes Elda yeah that's like the (23:06 - 23:11)
ones Elda I've played yeah and you (23:08 - 23:13)
remember the kangaroo boxing kangaroo (23:11 - 23:16)
would be memorable they could be the (23:13 - 23:21)
next Lucario I'm honey yeah not real (23:16 - 23:23)
hard time with this too hard a question (23:21 - 23:24)

pokemon game I mean katamari damacy is (24:55 - 25:00)
possibly the most perfect game ever (24:59 - 25:03)
created but I think wills better we love (25:00 - 25:06)
Katamari is no no no no no no no correct (25:03 - 25:08)
and cut Amari Demasi you roll up and you (25:06 - 25:10)
make the mood in the family's all (25:08 - 25:11)
together and you want to talk about (25:10 - 25:13)
about rolling up the entire universe and (25:11 - 25:16)
we love you Taylor yes boy I guess it's (25:13 - 25:19)
like it's for like 3 console generations (25:16 - 25:21)
ago so for right now monster hunter (25:19 - 25:23)
generations play every single day even (25:21 - 25:25)
played it this morning all right I will (25:23 - 25:29)
I heard all of it sharing a hotel room I (25:25 - 25:35)
would probably say destiny yeah too many (25:29 - 25:37)
hours too much money spent not getting (25:35 - 25:42)
moved over to destiny too I gotta vote (25:37 - 25:46)
for Blastoise what do you think is the (25:42 - 25:49)
best offensive dual typing probably more (25:46 - 25:55)
for Travis cuz yeah um I has to be a (25:49 - 25:58)
real one too so I mean I'm for purely (25:55 - 26:00)
talking about often like because ice (25:58 - 26:02)
that's the thing with Isis that it's (26:00 - 26:03)
good to have often silly but not (26:02 - 26:08)
defensively so maybe like ice ice dragon (26:03 - 26:11)
like your um the greatest dragon all the (26:08 - 26:13)
game sure no dragon isn't a good type (26:11 - 26:14)
often simply cuz (26:13 - 26:16)
only super effective against so maybe (26:14 - 26:17)
like ice fairy or something would be (26:16 - 26:21)
pretty good mmm don't know whatever you (26:17 - 26:23)
got double coverage I can't this is too (26:21 - 26:29)

the Hoenn region hey yeah that's a good (26:41 - 26:48)
answer it's amazing that they could like (26:46 - 26:51)
ruin Hoenn but in a Lola it's all (26:48 - 26:53)
islands but yeah but you know it's just (26:51 - 26:55)
right yeah but you don't have to spend (26:53 - 26:58)
all of it we don't I said I would have a (26:55 - 26:59)
new year's resolution where I wouldn't (26:58 - 27:01)
get angry so I stopped myself (26:59 - 27:05)
mid-sentence we have a vote for gastro (27:01 - 27:07)
Don which we were just will and I were (27:05 - 27:08)
having an argument about gastro done (27:07 - 27:10)
before we started this I like gastrin (27:08 - 27:12)
I'll I think astronaut is a troll VGC (27:10 - 27:15)
Pokemon and please leave this auditorium (27:12 - 27:18)
the question is have you played Fire (27:15 - 27:20)
Emblem yet and then the person says in (27:18 - 27:23)
some ways it's better than Pokemon in (27:20 - 27:26)
some areas um I've only played Fire (27:23 - 27:29)
Emblem heroes the iOS game so I'm not a (27:26 - 27:32)
very good judge of the franchise in my (27:29 - 27:33)
role for any video game that I'll ever (27:32 - 27:35)
play has to have three things it has to (27:33 - 27:37)
be cute has to involve rolling and has (27:35 - 27:40)
to involve collecting things and I this (27:37 - 27:42)
does you gotta collect the heroes what (27:40 - 27:45)
do you roll your your crew down the (27:42 - 27:52)
street have you played fire in one steam (27:45 - 27:54)
I have you I like firing them it's it's (27:52 - 27:57)
a time commitment though I gotta vote (27:54 - 27:59)
for Lapras the question is what is your (27:57 - 28:05)
favorite starter Syndic well of course (27:59 - 28:08)
froakie (28:05 - 28:08)
probably Oshawott really yeah he's (28:09 - 28:15)
beautiful no I mean I'm gonna be started (28:13 - 28:19)
on it's evolutions but although you know (28:15 - 28:21)
I do have a level 100 chespin because I (28:19 - 28:22)
refused to evolve it because I really (28:21 - 28:25)
really like chespin quilladin quilladin (28:22 - 28:27)
is great I know I mean that basically i (28:25 - 28:30)
did but alright i'm surprised this is (28:27 - 28:33)
our first vote for melodic and the (28:30 - 28:35)
question is what is the funniest looking (28:33 - 28:40)
pokemon hmm there's this an ice cream (28:35 - 28:48)
cone anything like food-related that's (28:40 - 28:50)
that's usually a garba doors pretty (28:48 - 28:56)
funny car hoarder yeah yeah oh no spin (28:50 - 28:59)
de-spin yeah it's been doesn't get drunk (28:56 - 29:03)
all the time it's wrong it's time of our (28:59 - 29:06)
time I think I am I vibe goes for oddish (29:03 - 29:08)
cuz like it's funny like cute like a (29:06 - 29:13)
weed like a weed eat we done dude is it (29:08 - 29:15)
my turn I guess it is it's a vote for (29:13 - 29:18)
vaporeon huh and then the question is do (29:15 - 29:22)
you play competitive Pokemon kind of I i (29:18 - 29:24)
use in sorry do you play competitive (29:22 - 29:27)
Pokemon okay i used two more and we (29:24 - 29:29)
talked about it on the show so I'm red (29:27 - 29:30)
up enough on it that I can continue (29:29 - 29:33)
talking about it but I don't play it (29:30 - 29:34)
enough to where I can confidently say (29:33 - 29:36)
yes anymore yeah but you do showdown (29:34 - 29:39)
like from time to time yeah yeah yes (29:36 - 29:41)
yeah I go to VGC regionals I tried to go (29:39 - 29:43)
to one regional year so I'll build one (29:41 - 29:44)
team for whatever the meta is at that (29:43 - 29:46)
time but it's just to have fun at of (29:44 - 29:48)
regionals I don't like try to win I (29:46 - 29:50)
think if Pokemon company store a 44 year (29:48 - 29:53)
old man in their champion yeah they (29:50 - 29:56)
probably cancel the whole thing we're (29:53 - 29:58)
know your yours or maybe not that I (29:56 - 30:01)
couldn't take it all I'll just leave it (29:58 - 30:02)
to the kids who actually might need a (30:01 - 30:04)
scholarship yeah our podcast just be (30:02 - 30:07)
more competitive and it we we shied away (30:04 - 30:09)
from that because there are just better (30:07 - 30:10)
outlets for that there's a lot of (30:09 - 30:12)
youtubers that are really great with (30:10 - 30:13)
competitive (30:12 - 30:16)
and it's easier to show I think then (30:13 - 30:19)
listen to that but we do do a Pokemon of (30:16 - 30:22)
the week every episode and Travis gets (30:19 - 30:24)
one or two move sets that he puts (30:22 - 30:27)
together with with our community and so (30:24 - 30:29)
at least if you are in competitive we (30:27 - 30:31)
talk about you know Louis and / which I (30:29 - 30:33)
think was last week we will give you a (30:31 - 30:35)
move setting and actually tell you why (30:33 - 30:37)
that works I think a lot of times you (30:35 - 30:39)
can read them you can read a move set (30:37 - 30:40)
off like smoke out or something and then (30:39 - 30:43)
that doesn't actually tell you you can (30:40 - 30:45)
find you can find it but right off the (30:43 - 30:46)
bat just reading a move set doesn't tell (30:45 - 30:47)
you how you should use it or what you (30:46 - 30:49)
should pair that with it's like going (30:47 - 30:51)
out to dinner and parents take with a (30:49 - 30:53)
fine wine and something like that we're (30:51 - 30:56)
not that fancy we're like out back when (30:53 - 31:00)
it comes to VG sees no rules just right (30:56 - 31:02)
but i would say anybody who's ever (31:00 - 31:04)
thought about going to a VGC regionals (31:02 - 31:05)
even if you don't have a great team just (31:04 - 31:07)
go and have fun because you're around a (31:05 - 31:08)
bunch of people who just want to play (31:07 - 31:10)
pokemon competitions for a couple of (31:08 - 31:12)
hours you don't have to win to have fun (31:10 - 31:16)
yeah I played the BGC very creditably (31:12 - 31:19)
when gen5 came out and yeah a lot of a (31:16 - 31:20)
lot of fun but it's it's a time (31:19 - 31:22)
commitment and I think that's why a lot (31:20 - 31:24)
of people do like showdown and stuff to (31:22 - 31:27)
lessen that load we had a vote for (31:24 - 31:31)
feraligatr who how many pokemon is too (31:27 - 31:34)
many never never yeah now we haven't hit (31:31 - 31:36)
it yet we got pokemon bank now you can (31:34 - 31:38)
just like put them in the bank and I see (31:36 - 31:41)
more I think the fact that they've done (31:38 - 31:42)
things like mega evolution and then the (31:41 - 31:45)
low in forums shows that the pokemon (31:42 - 31:47)
company is at least aware that there's a (31:45 - 31:50)
certain pace at which they can introduce (31:47 - 31:52)
new Pokemon where it might be too much (31:50 - 31:54)
to continue to be able to remember all (31:52 - 31:57)
of them so introducing these ones that (31:54 - 31:59)
are then related to already released (31:57 - 32:02)
Pokemon at least makes it lightens that (31:59 - 32:04)
memory load as the next game comes (32:02 - 32:08)
outside I think they recognize the sort (32:04 - 32:10)
of inherent inflation of just increasing (32:08 - 32:12)
the number of Pokemon every game I think (32:10 - 32:14)
they've recognized that problem yeah i (32:12 - 32:17)
think the alone in pokemon do such a (32:14 - 32:20)
good job of reminding you what pokemon (32:17 - 32:22)
existed out of the 700 (32:20 - 32:24)
you might have forgotten like think (32:22 - 32:26)
about before sun and moon came out how (32:24 - 32:27)
many people were that excited for (32:26 - 32:30)
executor and then all of a sudden a lull (32:27 - 32:32)
in executor cam and everyone was like oh (32:30 - 32:36)
my god look up to Ellen is ah and if you (32:32 - 32:37)
were to ask me a year ago what I thought (32:36 - 32:39)
of executor I would have been gentle (32:37 - 32:43)
okay it's a tree cool but now you know (32:39 - 32:46)
more than the treehouse legit now it's (32:43 - 32:50)
rolling but yeah I like that treatment (32:46 - 32:52)
of like okay we're going to allow lymph (32:50 - 32:53)
I we're going to Lowell in by this (32:52 - 32:56)
Pokemon in and bring something back to (32:53 - 33:00)
it and obviously we're going to get to a (32:56 - 33:01)
thousand Pokemon eventually right yeah (33:00 - 33:04)
and I feel like that thousands Pokemon (33:01 - 33:05)
is going to be really special and (33:04 - 33:07)
they're gonna give it the lucario push (33:05 - 33:10)
yeah hopefully it's just you know not (33:07 - 33:12)
Lucario junior or something like that (33:10 - 33:14)
you know is it amazing they already have (33:12 - 33:18)
what is riolu it's already that what a (33:14 - 33:20)
gift gen5 was that you could just catch (33:18 - 33:22)
like 150 Pokemon and have your regional (33:20 - 33:24)
decks and you didn't have to worry about (33:22 - 33:26)
all these other like what is it what's (33:24 - 33:28)
the lowest side of the regional deck (33:26 - 33:32)
decks for Lola is it like 300 yeah I (33:28 - 33:34)
don't remember yeah it's too big oh yeah (33:32 - 33:39)
yeah the gen 5 is really good is it my (33:34 - 33:41)
turn to ask a question I don't have any (33:39 - 33:42)
questions left so go ahead so we have a (33:41 - 33:45)
vote for suicune and then yeah it's a (33:42 - 33:47)
good move not like that and then the (33:45 - 33:49)
question is if you could create a new (33:47 - 33:52)
type of Pokemon what would it be mmm (33:49 - 33:55)
sound type oh you're yeah you're like (33:52 - 33:57)
cheating is you're just like giving (33:55 - 33:58)
answers you've already given it that one (33:57 - 33:59)
because I'm so confident in these (33:58 - 34:03)
answers so there are so many set okay so (33:59 - 34:04)
first off you have like hook my clown (34:03 - 34:09)
Loudred and Noah Verne and you could (34:04 - 34:11)
even you could even put like Magnemite (34:09 - 34:13)
and and Magneton and magnetometer that (34:11 - 34:16)
because of how they emit waves but then (34:13 - 34:20)
you have moves like growl snarl a sonic (34:16 - 34:22)
boom name a single pokemon move that (34:20 - 34:26)
would not make a sound come on what is (34:22 - 34:29)
the sound of one Pokemon them call mine (34:26 - 34:31)
is a good answer yeah notice I got the (34:29 - 34:34)
right answer and you just talking about (34:31 - 34:37)
splash water now sound would be a legit (34:34 - 34:40)
the correct answer is don't create a new (34:37 - 34:41)
type it's already confusing enough to (34:40 - 34:44)
remember that bug resists ground or is (34:41 - 34:48)
it the other way around nobody knows (34:44 - 34:51)
nope nobody knows you're out of (34:48 - 34:53)
questions well right yeah i'll get some (34:51 - 34:58)
thumb vote for star me what pokemon do (34:53 - 35:03)
you wish hadn't evolved hmm chespin no (34:58 - 35:07)
no so weird the starter is the only one (35:03 - 35:12)
that doesn't evolve lettin is a good at (35:07 - 35:14)
well it is already don't get me started (35:12 - 35:17)
on live I'm a big fan of it my mom was (35:14 - 35:20)
super disappointed in Layton's evolution (35:17 - 35:22)
she was like I had a cute little cat but (35:20 - 35:27)
what happens oh I don't know your (35:22 - 35:30)
wrestler I'll also go the starter I'll (35:27 - 35:33)
say dar tricks I like better than to (35:30 - 35:37)
said you I why I already look like dart (35:33 - 35:38)
trick so I guess it's just a vanity (35:37 - 35:44)
thing am i up yeah all right vote for (35:38 - 35:48)
pip good book please look better (35:44 - 35:51)
than oshawott the question is what is (35:48 - 35:54)
the best first Pokemon game and maybe we (35:51 - 35:56)
interpreted that is like what is the (35:54 - 35:58)
best pokemon game for someone to start (35:56 - 36:00)
with like what is the best entry into (35:58 - 36:03)
the series I might say black and white (36:00 - 36:05)
are pretty good I you don't want to set (36:03 - 36:07)
them off your disappointment but yours (36:05 - 36:08)
down so good (36:07 - 36:10)
the game is good and it keeps things (36:08 - 36:11)
simple for the same reason that will (36:10 - 36:14)
mentioned before that it's it's all the (36:11 - 36:15)
pokemon are new so you don't have this (36:14 - 36:18)
expectation of like having t'en know (36:15 - 36:19)
things that the other players at the (36:18 - 36:23)
same time didn't and there's only 150 or (36:19 - 36:26)
151 to worry about until the until the (36:23 - 36:28)
postgame so keeps things simple for a (36:26 - 36:30)
new player indeed more oxygen x and y (36:28 - 36:32)
are also a good answer yeah x and y is (36:30 - 36:34)
good because you can farm berries all (36:32 - 36:37)
day long fantastic and you can cross (36:34 - 36:39)
breed them and you make the mulches oh (36:37 - 36:41)
why did they give it any only person (36:39 - 36:44)
that ever did very farming every day I (36:41 - 36:46)
loved it I was so peaceful alright i (36:44 - 36:47)
would i would say heartgold soulsilver (36:46 - 36:50)
is a good place to start so complicated (36:47 - 36:53)
nah i was nine years old I understood (36:50 - 36:57)
Pokemon back when gold and silver came (36:53 - 37:01)
out a very advanced bah haha okay go yep (36:57 - 37:04)
squirtle is the vote the question is (37:01 - 37:09)
dogs or cats I got one of each and I (37:04 - 37:14)
hate my cat so dogs there we go uh I (37:09 - 37:19)
guess dogs yeah sick cats and lit no (37:14 - 37:22)
spray whole month and the vols into an (37:19 - 37:27)
even greater Pokemon uh Travis oh sure (37:22 - 37:30)
yeah it's a vote for gold doc which this (37:27 - 37:33)
is another good pokemon the question is (37:30 - 37:36)
wait I have to read this again what is (37:33 - 37:39)
oh okay what is the least non-water type (37:36 - 37:42)
water-type pokemon so i guess that means (37:39 - 37:44)
what is the water-type pokemon that (37:42 - 37:46)
seems like it shouldn't deserve (37:44 - 37:49)
water-type shouldn't deserve it don't (37:46 - 37:51)
look like it has water Titus to answer (37:49 - 37:55)
wait am I might confuse volcania on that (37:51 - 37:57)
dudes well yeah that makes and a water (37:55 - 37:59)
waters got no water this fire and water (37:57 - 38:02)
a part of him is water he can do the (37:59 - 38:05)
water through his like Jesse I mean I (38:02 - 38:07)
haven't seen him do anything so now look (38:05 - 38:09)
at hartnell I guess so much he's a steam (38:07 - 38:13)
yeah he's like a tasty buck uh doesn't (38:09 - 38:15)
have the authorized confirmed that's a (38:13 - 38:17)
bit (38:15 - 38:20)
it gasps ferdon that shouldn't be water (38:17 - 38:24)
what no that is a slug I gotta vote for (38:20 - 38:27)
vaporeon which for trainers from all the (38:24 - 38:33)
elite four are the most elite that's my (38:27 - 38:35)
god yeah you think these are ya homework (38:33 - 38:37)
assignment somebody thought instant (38:35 - 38:41)
lance and lance's well he's got another (38:37 - 38:43)
dragonite fun awesome yeah that's a (38:41 - 38:45)
problem of lances injured one he doesn't (38:43 - 38:48)
actually use dragon type Pokemon he has (38:45 - 38:50)
a gyarados he has a narrow dactyl maybe (38:48 - 38:53)
he'd like to Dragon Knights right yeah (38:50 - 38:56)
that's the problem is he he could have (38:53 - 38:57)
been great if they just held it like (38:56 - 39:01)
waited but they were like hey we need a (38:57 - 39:02)
dragon person at the end and we only (39:01 - 39:04)
hate we freaked we messed up guys 150 (39:02 - 39:07)
Pokemon we only have dragonite we drop (39:04 - 39:10)
the ball I would say Agatha is more (39:07 - 39:13)
memorable Agatha school and she's old (39:10 - 39:18)
and awesome like Truffaut laddoos just (39:13 - 39:24)
cut keep that to yourself I think hard (39:18 - 39:26)
to pick for like what's like the hardest (39:24 - 39:31)
elite four person um I'm trying to even (39:26 - 39:32)
think of what game had the most (39:31 - 39:37)
difficult to leap for maybe because I (39:32 - 39:38)
feel like the last few games have been (39:37 - 39:41)
pretty easy as problems are it's really (39:38 - 39:45)
like maybe like gen 3 or 4 might have (39:41 - 39:48)
had them or jen to start even say my (39:45 - 39:50)
problem is like gen 3 4 and 5 I get (39:48 - 39:53)
super blurry on elite four people what (39:50 - 39:54)
do you mean blurry like you don't (39:53 - 39:56)
remember I don't really remember yeah so (39:54 - 39:59)
that like I remember Agatha and I think (39:56 - 40:02)
what also helps was that when they did (39:59 - 40:07)
the short series oh yeah generation i (40:02 - 40:08)
put my generations like I don't know (40:07 - 40:10)
when i watch that egga thought also (40:08 - 40:13)
stood out there to me too yeah well I'm (40:10 - 40:14)
gonna go to one it's only gonna be (40:13 - 40:19)
anything yes elite one can I get a (40:14 - 40:20)
question yet gotta vote for marsh stop (40:19 - 40:22)
so congrats (40:20 - 40:24)
that one that's a real crawl out how (40:22 - 40:27)
would you improve Pokemon go I got an (40:24 - 40:29)
easy answer for this because the only (40:27 - 40:30)
time I get to play pokemon go because (40:29 - 40:33)
I'm one of those 40 hour week job people (40:30 - 40:35)
is when I'm walking my dog and we pretty (40:33 - 40:39)
much just walk the same mile every time (40:35 - 40:42)
so I see the same Pokemon every time the (40:39 - 40:44)
same focus tops if they could like mix (40:42 - 40:46)
it up they do they just don't do it and (40:44 - 40:48)
it's not enough it's not enough to keep (40:46 - 40:50)
me interested so that would help i'm (40:48 - 40:52)
always a fan of making sure all of the (40:50 - 40:55)
mechanics of the game are visible and (40:52 - 40:56)
understandable to the player without (40:55 - 40:59)
really having to dig into it like unless (40:56 - 41:02)
you're parked on the subreddit all the (40:59 - 41:04)
time you're not going to know how like (41:02 - 41:06)
nests work and what a nest rotation is (41:04 - 41:08)
and all this stuff and it for a while (41:06 - 41:09)
nobody really knew how the game worked (41:08 - 41:11)
at first until just word of mouth spread (41:09 - 41:13)
and there's i guess there's some value (41:11 - 41:14)
to that because it feels like you are (41:13 - 41:16)
sort of solving a mystery together but I (41:14 - 41:18)
don't necessarily think that a casual (41:16 - 41:20)
video game should also be a mystery I (41:18 - 41:22)
think it should be clear how the game is (41:20 - 41:23)
played and that all of the mechanics are (41:22 - 41:26)
also why is heracross only available in (41:23 - 41:29)
like South America yeah that's that's my (41:26 - 41:31)
problem is like the Kangas like king of (41:29 - 41:34)
scans only in Australia and I think (41:31 - 41:37)
farfetch is only in Japan Europe Europe (41:34 - 41:41)
now so I mr. my Maharaja your family and (41:37 - 41:44)
there's no trading now yeah yeah yeahs (41:41 - 41:46)
not but names aide said I think they (41:44 - 41:47)
said that training was not a lot of (41:46 - 41:50)
things which which I agree with I think (41:47 - 41:51)
the training should be locally because (41:50 - 41:53)
otherwise somebody's just going to farm (41:51 - 41:58)
Kangaskhan yeah and all right well we (41:53 - 42:01)
have like 10 minutes so again shout out (41:58 - 42:05)
