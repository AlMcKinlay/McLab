sparkling ice I don't know what a (0:50 - 0:55)
pomegranate tastes like so I just didn't (0:53 - 0:57)
the last time I had a pomegranate was (0:55 - 1:00)
like in 1994 when I was in Brazil if you (0:57 - 1:02)
think my taste buds have taste buds have (1:00 - 1:04)
that good memory you're thinking the (1:02 - 1:06)
wrong thing how did you avoid the (1:04 - 1:08)
pomegranate Bonanza that was the early (1:06 - 1:12)
2000s granted I don't like the shape of (1:08 - 1:14)
those bottles like the palm know I know (1:12 - 1:17)

already invoiced you one hundred and (1:48 - 1:51)
ninety eight thousand dollars you can (1:50 - 1:54)

thousand dollars Tom Nook is probably (1:56 - 2:01)
the smartest businessman here hey you (1:58 - 2:03)
didn't have to get the house you can (2:01 - 2:06)
live in that musty old tent for as long (2:03 - 2:09)
as you live in the tent but you can't (2:06 - 2:11)
hang things on the tent walls and when (2:09 - 2:13)
you have that right and you got a diner (2:11 - 2:15)
clock you need to hang i got gears (2:13 - 2:18)

don't like the combination of Tropicana (2:31 - 2:36)

a delightful worry that's not a thing (2:36 - 2:44)
what do you mean well what is here town (2:39 - 2:47)
moo-cow neoui oh nice so the town I grew (2:44 - 2:49)
up in in Hawaii though you can't name it (2:47 - 2:53)
after a real town strangely enough I did (2:49 - 2:56)
why can't you I mean I used to name them (2:53 - 2:59)
after my pets but then my pets went you (2:56 - 3:02)
know the way of the dodo and I felt bad (2:59 - 3:05)
about going back to those towns I guess (3:02 - 3:07)
that makes sense I am regretting that I (3:05 - 3:10)
couldn't go with my jocks suggestion of (3:07 - 3:16)
buff burg and I thought of buffer I love (3:10 - 3:20)
swole bill that I have although goose' (3:16 - 3:35)
just piled the biceps yeah all right (3:20 - 3:36)
well I don't think people want to hear (3:35 - 3:37)
too much about animal crossing but (3:36 - 3:40)
everyone is playing animal crossing (3:37 - 3:42)
there's two things that I feel like the (3:40 - 3:44)
Internet has been really good at talking (3:42 - 3:47)
about it is the corona virus and it is (3:44 - 3:50)
an elk crossing so while we do have some (3:47 - 3:52)
Pokemon news related to the corona virus (3:50 - 3:57)
let's put that on the DL for now we do (3:52 - 3:59)
it's off the official pokemon website so (3:57 - 4:03)
okay tackle that top three things in (3:59 - 4:05)
people's lives right now Animal Crossing (4:03 - 4:07)
then coronavirus and then we're gonna (4:05 - 4:09)
hit off the number three thing in (4:07 - 4:16)
people's lives the thing you can do I (4:09 - 4:19)
did plenty Pokemon go this morning I (4:16 - 4:21)

that's everything so that goes until (10:01 - 10:05)
Thursday March 26 10 p.m. local time so (10:02 - 10:07)
even when you're listening to this (10:05 - 10:09)
podcast on Monday or Tuesday you still (10:07 - 10:11)
do have some time to decide if you want (10:09 - 10:14)
to social distance your way around these (10:11 - 10:16)
raids and Pokemon that are appearing (10:14 - 10:18)
there's a Pidgey in my house I need that (10:16 - 10:23)
for the normal type of catch 25 normal (10:18 - 10:27)
types that's the hardest one in this (10:23 - 10:30)
game for genesect you need 25 to (10:27 - 10:31)
genesect (10:30 - 10:33)
is that wacky professor thinks whatever (10:31 - 10:35)
evidence he found looked like a normal (10:33 - 10:38)
type attack did we talked about this (10:35 - 10:41)
last week where if if you have one pokey (10:38 - 10:45)
coin you can get 30 in cents from these (10:41 - 10:47)
stores on one-time purchase and in sense (10:45 - 10:50)
not they now last an hour and sub 30 (10:47 - 10:52)
minutes for now and they they are (10:50 - 10:54)
literally spawning like one Pokemon a (10:52 - 10:56)
minute so that is Annie antics way of (10:54 - 10:59)
letting people play at home because (10:56 - 11:01)
you're going to get probably 30 30 or so (10:59 - 11:02)
poking (11:01 - 11:03)
spawning in your house without you (11:02 - 11:07)
leaving or moving the only problem with (11:03 - 11:10)
that is because you're not moving you're (11:07 - 11:11)
probably not getting pokeballs (11:10 - 11:14)
so either give yourself a late late (11:11 - 11:16)
night drive through a downtown area to (11:14 - 11:19)
spend a bunch of stops or now is the (11:16 - 11:21)
time to add friends and open their gifts (11:19 - 11:25)
because you're gonna run out of gifts to (11:21 - 11:28)
go somebody will send you gifts yeah I (11:25 - 11:30)
still get plenty of gifts yeah you just (11:28 - 11:32)
gotta open the 20 gifts but like I had (11:30 - 11:36)
to send gifts out yeah I have to go out (11:32 - 11:38)
and get gifts and it's it's a wasteland (11:36 - 11:41)
out there not in Wisconsin or something (11:38 - 11:44)
that I don't think we get the memo here (11:41 - 11:45)
I got the memo I don't think other (11:44 - 11:48)
people did some sort and shield news (11:45 - 11:49)
actually speaking of events maybe you (11:48 - 11:51)
want to stay in your house you want to (11:49 - 11:53)
do some sword and shield maybe you're (11:51 - 11:55)
not on the animal crossing bandwagon I (11:53 - 11:58)
got some news for you March 19th (11:55 - 12:01)
pokemon.com glaring rapidash Clarion (11:58 - 12:03)
Daraa Mook Amanda buzzer fetch and more (12:01 - 12:06)
version exclusive Pokemon might appear (12:03 - 12:08)
in max ray battles take this opportunity (12:06 - 12:09)
to catch pokemon that don't normally (12:08 - 12:11)
appear and you're in the wild in your (12:09 - 12:14)
game version as well as Pokemon that may (12:11 - 12:17)
be hard to find I'm super excited for (12:14 - 12:18)
this especially because I usually do (12:17 - 12:20)
raid some Monday nights and I think (12:18 - 12:21)
Monday night is still during the event (12:20 - 12:24)
time right yeah this will go til (12:21 - 12:25)
Wednesday March 25th (12:24 - 12:28)
so yeah so Greg we're gonna get on it (12:25 - 12:32)
I've been doing it well I didn't (12:28 - 12:34)
crossing my animals okay I crossed (12:32 - 12:36)
animals too but not until Friday I did (12:34 - 12:39)
it Wednesday Thursday and Friday evening (12:36 - 12:41)
I was in there I was getting my fossils (12:39 - 12:47)
I was getting my sir fetched I was (12:41 - 12:50)
getting my tins of beans that are from (12:47 - 12:53)
another game I was getting all that so (12:50 - 12:57)
I've been making like easy graphics for (12:53 - 13:00)
these on my Twitter and Instagram and I (12:57 - 13:02)
have learned since making these helpful (13:00 - 13:04)
graphics that people don't understand (13:02 - 13:09)
how raids work so when I posted this (13:04 - 13:12)
last one which is the rapid - Daraa (13:09 - 13:16)
Makkah when I posted this last one (13:12 - 13:18)
what was the response I got I get a lot (13:16 - 13:19)
of these response so I'll just read a (13:18 - 13:22)
generic on here I've been playing sword (13:19 - 13:24)
and shield I've been playing shield I (13:22 - 13:26)
have gotten literally everything on the (13:24 - 13:28)
screen they don't appear exclusively in (13:26 - 13:30)
one version at least from not what I (13:28 - 13:33)
seen is the comment I got when I made (13:30 - 13:35)
this huh (13:33 - 13:38)
sir fetch will not ever appear in shield (13:35 - 13:42)
but that doesn't mean you can't log into (13:38 - 13:45)
the why comm and see a sir fetch from (13:42 - 13:48)
somebody who is hosting from sword this (13:45 - 13:50)
event is now giving you the opportunity (13:48 - 13:53)
for sir fetch to appear in shield (13:50 - 13:55)
without you resulting on going to the Y (13:53 - 13:59)
comm that is clearly the the (13:55 - 14:01)
misunderstanding that they these people (13:59 - 14:04)
don't have also when I made the Gengar (14:01 - 14:06)
what was it the King gar Machamp (14:04 - 14:10)
Snorlax grass or Alexia so specifically (14:06 - 14:13)
and this is still going on Gengar (14:10 - 14:15)
appears in three and four star raids in (14:13 - 14:18)
both games but only five star raids and (14:15 - 14:22)
in shield and only Machamp appears in (14:18 - 14:24)
five star rates and sword but it will (14:22 - 14:26)
appear in 3 & 4 star raids in both games (14:24 - 14:29)
pretty easy to like think about that (14:26 - 14:31)
right and the amount of comments of life (14:29 - 14:34)
nah-ah I got Gangaram my game and I was (14:31 - 14:37)
like did you not miss the giant part (14:34 - 14:39)
where it said Gangaram a champ up here (14:37 - 14:42)
in both games only in 3 to 4 star raids (14:39 - 14:44)
which probably doesn't matter unless you (14:42 - 14:46)
just you're really looking for a 5 star (14:44 - 14:48)
Gengar for whatever reason and what's (14:46 - 14:50)
weird is I have a sword and have not (14:48 - 14:53)
seen a single Machamp (14:50 - 14:56)
yeah I think they yeah they're not (14:53 - 14:58)
they're not I think in the five stars (14:56 - 15:02)
they're 20% in the four and three stars (14:58 - 15:06)
I think they're only like 10% so ideally (15:02 - 15:07)
you should be seeing more Machamp (15:06 - 15:09)
weather if there are five stars but you (15:07 - 15:11)
have to clear out your raids and refresh (15:09 - 15:13)
and stuff and not with this new thing (15:11 - 15:16)
overlapping it's a little weird so (15:13 - 15:18)
speaking of this new thing it's still on (15:16 - 15:20)
this new thing all players will (15:18 - 15:24)
encounter s Cavalier SL gore and pink (15:20 - 15:27)
urchin which Pinkerton in itself is rare (15:24 - 15:30)
via saw gore and the escapa lear (15:27 - 15:31)
required trading so this is gonna help (15:30 - 15:33)
people out who don't have any friends to (15:31 - 15:36)
trade those two pokemon and sword you (15:33 - 15:38)
will encounter gallery' and rapidash (15:36 - 15:40)
glare and corsola manda buzz or ranga (15:38 - 15:44)
Oran guru Ren guru and then female in (15:40 - 15:48)
didi while in shield you'll be able to (15:44 - 15:51)
encounter Dara Mooka dar maka raver Airy (15:48 - 15:54)
past Simeon sir fetch and Mail indeedy (15:51 - 15:57)
instead which is even if you have these (15:54 - 15:59)
Pokemon it's an opportunity to get (15:57 - 16:02)
because these Pokemon are boosted and (15:59 - 16:04)
promoted whether you have sword or (16:02 - 16:05)
shield or you have friends that have the (16:04 - 16:07)
other version you'll be able to get at (16:05 - 16:09)
least their hidden abilities a little (16:07 - 16:11)
bit easier since they're only available (16:09 - 16:14)
in raids and you need to connect your (16:11 - 16:17)
Nintendo switch to the Internet make (16:14 - 16:19)

Pokemon masters but that might be a (18:58 - 19:03)
little bit longer so there was a lot of (19:00 - 19:07)
stories this past week of people getting (19:03 - 19:09)
in trouble for being out in a (19:07 - 19:12)
out and playing pokemon go especially in (19:09 - 19:16)
Italy but those stories are that I just (19:12 - 19:17)
told you the gist of it (19:16 - 19:19)
prettiest I made but they're not (19:17 - 19:22)
supposed to be out they are out shame (19:19 - 19:25)
right wow this is coronavirus related I (19:22 - 19:27)
think there's a more interesting story I (19:25 - 19:29)
think everyone is probably maybe (19:27 - 19:32)
purchased a t-shirt from T Fury before (19:29 - 19:35)
or at least maybe heard of T Fury I've (19:32 - 19:37)
heard it I think so do they make my (19:35 - 19:41)
unicorn t-shirts baby there's a lot of (19:37 - 19:43)
tissue there's like yet the Yeti and (19:41 - 19:46)
then there's T fury and then there's a (19:43 - 19:49)
Threadless they're always pumping out (19:46 - 19:53)
t-shirts this is off bleeding cool calm (19:49 - 19:56)
this time people were very upset here (19:53 - 19:58)
with them due to a design that went for (19:56 - 20:00)
sales yesterday one signed and one (19:58 - 20:02)
design known by an artist named capo (20:00 - 20:06)
depicted a Pokemon pokeballs only cook (20:02 - 20:09)
Ovid 19 virus with the caption gotta (20:06 - 20:10)
catch them all (20:09 - 20:13)
yep not good this other also depicted of (20:10 - 20:16)
a virus holding a free sign saying free (20:13 - 20:20)
hugs also not good and people then on (20:16 - 20:23)
Twitter yelled at T fury for these and T (20:20 - 20:25)
fury post a message saying we at T fury (20:23 - 20:26)
recognize that the current situation (20:25 - 20:29)
regarding Co vid 19 is extremely serious (20:26 - 20:31)
and is impacting all members of our (20:29 - 20:33)
community and missed the crisis we've (20:31 - 20:37)
looked to light-hearted humor to keep (20:33 - 20:39)
our spirits lifted we are grateful to (20:37 - 20:41)
the ki fury artist community for what (20:39 - 20:43)
they have done and continue to do to (20:41 - 20:45)
make a smile in this light these two (20:43 - 20:47)
designs that were posted were not well (20:45 - 20:49)
received by our community aka they (20:47 - 20:51)
didn't make any money from them please (20:49 - 20:53)
rest assured that our attention was not (20:51 - 20:55)
to be insensitive or disrespectful in (20:53 - 20:56)
any way both designs have been removed (20:55 - 20:59)
from the site and we sincerely apologize (20:56 - 21:02)
for the mistake it is such a weasel (20:59 - 21:05)
wording cunning (21:02 - 21:05)
these two design the poster were not (21:05 - 21:09)
well-received by our community they're (21:07 - 21:13)
in incredibly poor taste (21:09 - 21:17)
having good shirts and yeah it's like if (21:13 - 21:19)
they had made money or you had a bunch (21:17 - 21:21)
of people defending you you would have (21:19 - 21:22)
just been like no poor keeping up (21:21 - 21:26)
because it's humor it's like it's like (21:22 - 21:29)
it's like when the it's like go in a (21:26 - 21:30)
twelve-year-old comes into like a twitch (21:29 - 21:32)
stream and they say something really (21:30 - 21:36)
dumb and you like get out what and (21:32 - 21:38)
they're like well it's just a joke and (21:36 - 21:44)
you're like no here we have consequences (21:38 - 21:47)
for your actions ban yeah also please be (21:44 - 21:49)
assured that our intention was not to be (21:47 - 21:51)
insensitive or disrespectful (21:49 - 21:55)
actually it was that's the goal of the (21:51 - 21:59)
shirts they are poking fun at a very (21:55 - 22:03)
sensitive situation in an insensitive (21:59 - 22:04)
and disrespectful manner which is (22:03 - 22:07)
supposed to be where the humor comes (22:04 - 22:11)
from but it didn't your intention and (22:07 - 22:14)
the intentions of these shirts was to be (22:11 - 22:17)
an insensitive garbage this should be (22:14 - 22:20)
the last bit of coronavirus stuff I I (22:17 - 22:23)
believe for the episode here so this is (22:20 - 22:26)
a Pokemon calm important update (22:23 - 22:29)

and pre-release tournaments no (23:01 - 23:05)
championship points will be awarded (23:03 - 23:07)
during this time while independent of (23:05 - 23:09)
Pokemon organisers of these events (23:07 - 23:11)
should act in the best interest of their (23:09 - 23:13)
events and community including always (23:11 - 23:15)
being mindful of safety of participants (23:13 - 23:17)
we appreciate their cooperation their (23:15 - 23:18)
partnership during this challenge (23:17 - 23:21)
time well we do continue to closely (23:18 - 23:23)
monitor health mandates guidelines and (23:21 - 23:25)
recommendations from appropriate (23:23 - 23:27)
government agencies while availing (23:25 - 23:29)
evaluating all independent and Pokemon (23:27 - 23:32)
organised events on a case-by-case basis (23:29 - 23:36)
everything up to May 14th canceled we (23:32 - 23:39)
don't know if things are gonna be better (23:36 - 23:43)
elsewhere May 14th or after May 14th I (23:39 - 23:46)
know like believe South Korea is the (23:43 - 23:48)
main country that has things semi under (23:46 - 23:51)
control but they also got it (23:48 - 23:56)
back in December worlds is in the UK (23:51 - 23:58)
still for those that haven't been (23:56 - 24:00)
following to play pokemon events too (23:58 - 24:02)
closely so this is the first time that (24:00 - 24:05)
worlds would be out of North America (24:02 - 24:10)
it's been in like Hawaii Florida (24:05 - 24:15)
California it's also been in Canada once (24:10 - 24:18)
so August is a long way away and I (24:15 - 24:23)
believe the Madison sorry they're not in (24:18 - 24:25)
Madison anymore the Milwaukee regionals (24:23 - 24:28)
was scheduled for June 1st so that's (24:25 - 24:30)
still technically scheduled June is (24:28 - 24:33)
pretty far away still but I guess we (24:30 - 24:35)
don't know and I guess once we get (24:33 - 24:38)
closer to May 14th we'll have an update (24:35 - 24:40)
I believe they also tweeted although I (24:38 - 24:41)
don't have the tweet in front of me that (24:40 - 24:44)
they will be reevaluating how many (24:41 - 24:47)
championship points you will need to go (24:44 - 24:52)
to Worlds because I don't think (24:47 - 24:52)
to have it I think unless you're like (24:52 - 24:58)
winning like multiple regionals yeah you (24:54 - 24:59)
still might not even have enough I think (24:58 - 25:01)
you only get like 120 for retraining or (24:59 - 25:03)
regionals and you need 400 to get to (25:01 - 25:04)
Worlds (25:03 - 25:06)
but I don't have that in front of me at (25:04 - 25:09)
this point a lot of events cancelled yep (25:06 - 25:13)
it's a whole new world we live in (25:09 - 25:15)
well for the time being as well the time (25:13 - 25:18)
being not for all eternity now that'd (25:15 - 25:21)
[Laughter] (25:18 - 25:24)
true let's take a quick break we got (25:21 - 25:28)
some Pokemon masters news we have some (25:24 - 25:30)
more sword shield news we still have our (25:28 - 25:32)
questions of the week or Pokemon of the (25:30 - 25:34)
week all that stuff so we will be right (25:32 - 26:23)
back Newsweek look brain assaulted not a (25:34 - 26:25)
lot of people reported on this directly (26:23 - 26:29)
I think I tweeted it but sometimes I (26:25 - 26:30)
don't want to use my own tweet those (26:29 - 26:35)
sources here cite them yeah well you (26:30 - 26:37)
know okay this is OP Newsweek Pokemon (26:35 - 26:40)
sword and shield got a new update that (26:37 - 26:42)
fixes a bug that would crash when a vers (26:40 - 26:44)
trainer received a hacked Pokemon you (26:42 - 26:46)
know if you guys heard about this I did (26:44 - 26:50)
not hear about that yeah well it fixed (26:46 - 26:51)
it so you should be good now (26:50 - 26:52)
while there was a handful of bugs and (26:51 - 26:53)
problems with sword and shields the (26:52 - 26:56)
latest update 1.1.1 fixes a game (26:53 - 26:59)
crashing bug that caused many people to (26:56 - 27:01)
avoid using a popular feature in gen8 (26:59 - 27:03)
games of course they don't list the (27:01 - 27:04)
feature because they're probably not (27:03 - 27:09)
that educated but rude so okay so this (27:04 - 27:11)
is what I was waiting for this is why I (27:09 - 27:13)
couldn't find this the night the update (27:11 - 27:15)
went out this is why I pulled this (27:13 - 27:18)
article because it has the source the (27:15 - 27:22)
citing the source here so you guys don't (27:18 - 27:25)
know anytime something gets updated in (27:22 - 27:27)
Pokemon it's like sore (27:25 - 27:29)
shield or Pokemon home the Japanese (27:27 - 27:32)
support Pokemon website will say what it (27:29 - 27:35)
fixes we've talked about this before but (27:32 - 27:37)
the English website will never say what (27:35 - 27:40)
it fixes because of legal reasons Thank (27:37 - 27:44)
You lawyers so so this so Newsweek is (27:40 - 27:47)
reporting on Pokemon coach JP slash (27:44 - 27:50)
support or whatever it is translated so (27:47 - 27:52)
probably a little bit wrong when (27:50 - 27:53)
receiving a Pokemon that contains (27:52 - 27:56)
falsified data by surprise trade or (27:53 - 27:59)
communication trade we responded to the (27:56 - 28:01)
phenomenon such as game stoppage (27:59 - 28:03)
obviously that's a pretty poor (28:01 - 28:05)
translation ideally if you guys didn't (28:03 - 28:09)
hear about this there was an issue where (28:05 - 28:11)
people were making Pokemon using (28:09 - 28:13)
third-party apps probably something like (28:11 - 28:17)
pkx or whatnot and they were Pokemon (28:13 - 28:20)
that would not that these sort and (28:17 - 28:22)
shield games couldn't read properly when (28:20 - 28:23)
that Pokemon was like selected or (28:22 - 28:26)
highlighted in a player's game it would (28:23 - 28:29)
cause the game to completely crash you (28:26 - 28:31)
wouldn't lose anything but your game (28:29 - 28:34)
would hard reboot so the way to fix it (28:31 - 28:37)
was to either one just never surprise (28:34 - 28:40)
trade because you if you didn't listen (28:37 - 28:41)
to this podcast or follow any of this (28:40 - 28:43)
news you would have no idea that this is (28:41 - 28:45)
happening or to if you did receive it (28:43 - 28:47)
you would have to highlight the Pokemon (28:45 - 28:49)
and delete it not inspect it because (28:47 - 28:50)
inspecting it would cause the game to (28:49 - 28:54)
crash oh no so you have to immediately (28:50 - 28:57)
release it this update the one point one (28:54 - 28:59)
point one fixed that issue so now you're (28:57 - 29:00)
safe to surprise trade again (28:59 - 29:03)
everything's good official changelog (29:00 - 29:04)
also states several issues have been (29:03 - 29:06)
fixed to make the gameplay experience (29:04 - 29:08)
more comfortable but nothing was stated (29:06 - 29:14)
on that what does that mean hmm more (29:08 - 29:16)
comfortable is such a weird (29:14 - 29:18)
they changed the volume levels on the (29:16 - 29:21)
sound effects for steeps ears maybe I (29:18 - 29:24)
you it you know I wish they would the (29:21 - 29:26)
sounds they send him soft skittles so (29:24 - 29:28)
yeah you can you can surprise for it (29:26 - 29:31)
again again if you were surprised (29:28 - 29:34)
writing that's not really my bag (29:31 - 29:36)
I mean I was for a while there but then (29:34 - 29:38)
I stopped because I've been wandering on (29:36 - 29:44)
home oh the old Pokemon home mm-hmm need (29:38 - 29:45)
to look at my achievements on there that (29:44 - 29:48)
whole not to get back into animal (29:45 - 29:50)
crossing but the whole Nuuk miles thing (29:48 - 29:53)
has me like all hooked on a cheese (29:50 - 29:53)
everywhere and pokemons got him they're (29:54 - 30:01)
still mostly busted for me so the people (29:58 - 30:03)
who date of mine the Pokemon games and (30:01 - 30:05)
like post you know shiny ads and stuff (30:03 - 30:08)
they only said that he think that they (30:05 - 30:11)
saw in the code that it fixed the (30:08 - 30:13)
surprise trade they didn't say anything (30:11 - 30:15)
else so I'm not sure what the you know (30:13 - 30:17)
the other update did I don't know what (30:15 - 30:19)
else it did I guess we don't know unless (30:17 - 30:22)
you know the three people in the entire (30:19 - 30:23)
world who data mined Pokemon games (30:22 - 30:25)
decide that they want to look at the (30:23 - 30:27)
code again I feel like they would have (30:25 - 30:28)
probably done it by now since it's been (30:27 - 30:30)
almost a week but they haven't really (30:28 - 30:33)
said it or tweeted anything about it it (30:30 - 30:35)
still stands that you know some people (30:33 - 30:37)
believe that these shiny odds are broken (30:35 - 30:40)
in the overworld the Pokemon company has (30:37 - 30:42)
pushed two updates now and I don't (30:40 - 30:44)
whether it's broken or not I guess we (30:42 - 30:46)
still don't know I mean we're taking the (30:44 - 30:51)
word that some people believe that the (30:46 - 30:53)
data miners say it's broken but the data (30:51 - 30:54)
miners also were the same people that (30:53 - 30:57)
told us we needed to have some sort of (30:54 - 31:00)
chain which then Pokemon comm said we (30:57 - 31:02)
didn't need a chain so believe who you (31:00 - 31:04)
want to believe I guess but that has not (31:02 - 31:06)
been touched (31:04 - 31:09)
I guess that code remains unmodified so (31:06 - 31:12)
and then people still setting their (31:09 - 31:15)
dates forward to manipulate raids like (31:12 - 31:17)
that that still exists too so the update (31:15 - 31:19)
didn't fix either of that although I (31:17 - 31:21)
don't know if those are more complicated (31:19 - 31:24)
issues or the Pokemon company doesn't (31:21 - 31:26)
care about it or Hoonah I don't know (31:24 - 31:28)
that's that's that's hard to say (31:26 - 31:30)
but the thing that would cause your game (31:28 - 31:35)
to crash fixed good to go (31:30 - 31:36)
being a Pokemon home because Greg (31:35 - 31:39)
brought that up this is off the gamer (31:36 - 31:43)
comm Pokemon home catches man I hate (31:39 - 31:45)
this headline Pokemon home catches two (31:43 - 31:48)
point six million in gross revenue (31:45 - 31:50)

been available for a month there is a (31:50 - 31:53)
clear picture of how many people find (31:51 - 31:55)
value in the ability of transferring (31:53 - 31:57)

2.6 million worldwide 38 percent of that (32:00 - 32:05)
revenue coming from the United States (32:03 - 32:09)

the news that goes into like thick (32:28 - 32:33)
download numbers but ok a lot of people (32:30 - 32:36)
have downloaded Pokemon home and this (32:33 - 32:37)

badge for the challenge I don't know (32:39 - 32:43)
what challenge I completed I have no (32:41 - 32:45)
clue we're on one point (32:43 - 32:49)
0.10 so you know we're getting there (32:45 - 32:52)
they did fix the Miggy earnest stuff so (32:49 - 32:55)
now in order to get McGee erna that was (32:52 - 32:56)
fixed server side that didn't need an (32:55 - 33:00)
update you just need a registered living (32:56 - 33:03)
Dex you don't need the Pokemon all to be (33:00 - 33:05)
existing there you don't need to shift (33:03 - 33:06)
boxes you don't need to put them in (33:05 - 33:08)
order as soon as they get as soon as (33:06 - 33:10)
pokemon home recognizes that you at one (33:08 - 33:15)
point had all 890 pokemon in it (33:10 - 33:17)
even if you don't have them anymore it (33:15 - 33:19)
will give you the Miggy Rinna that seems (33:17 - 33:22)
to be working a hundred percent now you (33:19 - 33:24)
know if you're only missing like a Zehra (33:22 - 33:27)
aura and you're standing next to (33:24 - 33:29)
somebody else who has a zero or they can (33:27 - 33:31)
just trade it to you you can try to (33:29 - 33:33)
write back and then it should register (33:31 - 33:34)
for you to get my gear now you don't (33:33 - 33:37)
have to keep it in your pokedex so if (33:34 - 33:40)
you're if you if you have seen otherwise (33:37 - 33:44)
let us know on Twitter but I have seen (33:40 - 33:47)
zero to no complaints about Miggy R not (33:44 - 33:50)
ever since like last week it seems to be (33:47 - 33:53)
seems to be okay glad that's died down (33:50 - 33:55)

with you know what I don't get it I have (36:05 - 36:11)
met I have my only guesses and this is (36:09 - 36:12)
just speculation maybe they had to like (36:11 - 36:15)
shift some things around and then this (36:12 - 36:16)
was already planned so they were just (36:15 - 36:17)
like let's go with it (36:16 - 36:20)

Sabrina I had the gifts you don't get (37:04 - 37:07)
nothing with her so these are the only (37:06 - 37:10)
two I felt like this is how I feel with (37:07 - 37:12)
masters we went through like so many (37:10 - 37:15)
cool things and so like Stephen read (37:12 - 37:18)
Giovanni coming back Professor Oak Eliza (37:15 - 37:21)

nothing (37:21 - 37:25)
like we have Sabrina and Finn Tina I (37:22 - 37:27)
mean they're more than nothing (37:25 - 37:29)
they're just not the ones you're excited (37:27 - 37:32)
for there's somebody out there their (37:29 - 37:33)
favorite gym leader is fan Tina I don't (37:32 - 37:35)
think they like Harrington yeah (37:33 - 37:38)
I guarantee it yeah I mean they just (37:35 - 37:42)
they're like their banners like okay Amy (37:38 - 37:45)
I had kind of wish that they had (37:42 - 37:48)
combined them into one banner instead of (37:45 - 37:52)
two but you know whoever you want more (37:48 - 37:56)
pull on that one more I guess I've been (37:52 - 38:01)
sort of out of masters for a little bit (37:56 - 38:03)
because these aren't that inspiring I'm (38:01 - 38:05)
like okay like I have a really good (38:03 - 38:08)
ghost type I have a really good psychic (38:05 - 38:11)
type these aren't huge drawers to make (38:08 - 38:16)
me spend my gems on them like there's (38:11 - 38:18)
gonna be another banner of something (38:16 - 38:19)
that I don't have or that there's a hole (38:18 - 38:22)
in my team that I'm just gonna wait so (38:19 - 38:25)

questions PTC Gio (39:32 - 39:39)
I don't like competitions think PTC do (39:34 - 39:44)
at this point is stable enough to host (39:39 - 39:47)
an actual tournament I gotta play that (39:44 - 39:49)
more now that I got my gaming PC I gotta (39:47 - 39:51)

kind of didn't go back into it it's fun (40:02 - 40:08)
I do like PTC Gio do you yeah do you (40:05 - 40:10)
like the Pokemon Trading Card Game (40:08 - 40:13)
I do I just don't like the people who (40:10 - 40:20)
play it every trading card game oh heck (40:13 - 40:22)
no I use thanked are using magics (40:20 - 40:25)
players better than Pokemon players it (40:22 - 40:28)
depends on where you're playing magic (40:25 - 40:31)
and who you're playing with I mean I get (40:28 - 40:35)
to play magic with Greg so yes you're (40:31 - 40:36)
saying Vanguard players are better than (40:35 - 40:39)
Pokemon players Vanguard players are the (40:36 - 40:42)
most elite best card game players out (40:39 - 40:43)
there (40:42 - 40:46)
Vanguard players are non-existent (40:43 - 40:49)
would you stop that's like the fabled (40:46 - 40:53)
like kind of like the Jedi were in the (40:49 - 40:56)
original first movie and it's like just (40:53 - 40:58)
a whisper of a fabled people that's all (40:56 - 41:01)
they heard of it myth yes exactly (40:58 - 41:05)
amongst us the Vanguard players you (41:01 - 41:07)
cannot see them you will not know them (41:05 - 41:09)
but they're there hidden in the shadows (41:07 - 41:21)
ready to check their drives nincada I (41:09 - 41:23)
don't I disagree (41:21 - 41:27)
I reject agree that's even worse that's (41:23 - 41:30)
yeah neato Reno whose talks like that (41:27 - 41:38)
except for Steve black jr. he's gone (41:30 - 41:43)
forever God and never seen again Greg - (41:38 - 41:46)
the shadow realms Greg you requested the (41:43 - 41:48)
Lewinsky I forgot to put one up alright (41:46 - 41:51)

not happy Greg and I feel like I'm in a (42:09 - 42:14)
gay bar in the 90s again great it's a (42:11 - 42:17)
gift that will keep on giving Nick did a (42:14 - 42:19)
real fantastic job with the music of (42:17 - 42:21)
last week's episode of play man I'm so (42:19 - 42:24)
mad this is I'm actually pointing the (42:21 - 42:27)
email from you this is from Jake they (42:24 - 42:28)
write it and say hey guys I'm new the (42:27 - 42:31)
podcast loved the content something I (42:28 - 42:33)
really like is the dynamic you all have (42:31 - 42:35)
you seem like actual friends and it (42:33 - 42:37)
makes a difference it makes me think I'm (42:35 - 42:41)
glad we're pulling that scam off still (42:37 - 42:43)
makes me think of my own friend group (42:41 - 42:46)
one guy in particular is my Pokemon (42:43 - 42:49)
rival I showed how to ivy and Eevee (42:46 - 42:51)
train a couple years ago and now we (42:49 - 42:54)
trade ideals on move sets and team (42:51 - 42:56)
builds and when we when we have the time (42:54 - 42:59)
we also do some ferocious battles these (42:56 - 43:01)
battles are interesting because we have (42:59 - 43:02)
learned that each other's play styles (43:01 - 43:05)
and developing our own meta we also do (43:02 - 43:07)
themed battles like monotype team or (43:05 - 43:09)
Pokemon from only one region my question (43:07 - 43:11)
to you is do you guys battle each other (43:09 - 43:13)
off air or do you have other friends (43:11 - 43:15)
that you battle have you developed your (43:13 - 43:18)
own meta or do you specifically do (43:15 - 43:21)
specialty rules from time to time it (43:18 - 43:22)
could be fun to do a listener tournament (43:21 - 43:24)
or something like that love the show (43:22 - 43:24)
Jake (43:24 - 43:30)
so in slack I believe yes that there are (43:24 - 43:33)
tournaments I I used to participate in (43:30 - 43:35)
them until they named them goofy (43:33 - 43:37)
tournaments and animation with that (43:35 - 43:45)
corporate standing this yes I once also (43:37 - 43:49)
ran a tournament in our slack so if you (43:45 - 43:50)
want alternate rules what did I call it (43:49 - 43:53)
oh it was awful (43:50 - 43:54)
it (43:53 - 43:58)
yes it was awful the max tournament no (43:54 - 44:02)
it was like wills oh it was like four (43:58 - 44:04)
years ago boy and it's like you had to (44:02 - 44:07)
have one like super dumb Pokemon on your (44:04 - 44:11)
team yep no wills quickie quick law (44:07 - 44:19)
tournament you had to have I mean we've (44:11 - 44:20)
done them before and I've done them in (44:19 - 44:23)
the past I haven't done anything (44:20 - 44:26)
recently just because I've been busy (44:23 - 44:28)
yeah I'm an island called new Connie OE (44:26 - 44:31)
that has all these animal type people (44:28 - 44:34)
that rely on my services to keep them (44:31 - 44:36)
going I have tied fruitless time for (44:34 - 44:40)
Pokemon games and battles I came in (44:36 - 44:42)
second in the first slack tournament (44:40 - 44:44)
that's pretty good (44:42 - 44:45)
that's pretty good you never eat that (44:44 - 44:48)
yeah Andrew got the truth Merlyn that's (44:45 - 44:50)
like whenever I did it again so he just (44:48 - 44:53)
held on to that trophy yeah I mean I've (44:50 - 44:56)
done it in the past I do them from time (44:53 - 44:58)
to time I think they're very fun I tend (44:56 - 45:01)
to enjoy making teams but I don't I'm (44:58 - 45:05)
not good at PvP anything it just really (45:01 - 45:07)
accept that clash Royale you're pretty (45:05 - 45:10)
alright at that I was I didn't (45:07 - 45:12)
necessarily like it but I played it (45:10 - 45:16)
hahaha but there's something about the (45:12 - 45:18)
player versus player that stresses me (45:16 - 45:20)
out more than any other content so I (45:18 - 45:23)
enjoy making teams but I don't really (45:20 - 45:26)
enjoy using them I think it's because I (45:23 - 45:31)
get really too invested in winning to (45:26 - 45:35)
enjoy like the experience yeah I will (45:31 - 45:41)
say I like my peak for PvP pokémon (45:35 - 45:43)
battling tournament style stuff was (45:41 - 45:46)
Omega Ruby alpha sapphire just because (45:43 - 45:49)
like though the way that you could breed (45:46 - 45:53)
and you know get your team and do IB (45:49 - 45:55)
Evie training everything just it clicked (45:53 - 45:58)
so well for me during that time and I've (45:55 - 46:00)
kind of like lost track of how to do all (45:58 - 46:03)
the different steps to build your own (46:00 - 46:05)
team and I will say that in the past (46:03 - 46:07)
when I've done competitive (46:05 - 46:10)
of like regionals and stuff like that (46:07 - 46:12)
I've had other people make my teams for (46:10 - 46:14)
me which is enjoyable but I also you (46:12 - 46:16)
know like to build my own teams but just (46:14 - 46:18)
that the time commitment for that and (46:16 - 46:20)
just like I don't have that clique of (46:18 - 46:24)
real understanding of you know all the (46:20 - 46:26)
different steps to take to get the (46:24 - 46:28)
Pokemon that you particularly want to (46:26 - 46:31)
have for your team so that's kind of (46:28 - 46:32)
what's holding me back now I may get (46:31 - 46:37)
there with the Isle of iron iron with it (46:32 - 46:41)
well yeah that's I should have named my (46:37 - 46:43)
if we're gonna complain about Animal (46:41 - 46:45)
Crossing the problem is your town could (46:43 - 46:47)
only be like 10 characters long trust (46:45 - 46:49)
nucleo he doesn't fit either there's no (46:47 - 46:52)
space up in there they should they (46:49 - 46:54)
should have fish that gamefreak work on (46:52 - 46:56)
a Game Freak at least has gotten to 12 (46:54 - 46:58)
characters and their things did they (46:56 - 47:01)
also decide you by putting like like 20 (46:58 - 47:03)
little brown underlines yeah like oh I (47:01 - 47:06)
gonna have the best pound name ever and (47:03 - 47:07)
then you start filling it out it's like (47:06 - 47:14)
well so many dashes that you can't fill (47:07 - 47:16)
it's just cruel it's actually really bad (47:14 - 47:21)
design like like just very bad for (47:16 - 47:26)
yeah I don't - is mean spaces (47:21 - 47:28)
Dash's mean things they used to mean (47:26 - 47:32)
something to answer Jake's question uh (47:28 - 47:36)
I have been trying to actively learn and (47:32 - 47:38)
get better at competitive video game (47:36 - 47:43)
Pokemon and it is both a time-consuming (47:38 - 47:48)
and frustrating and fun experience yeah (47:43 - 47:50)
your voice really sold that one that's (47:48 - 47:51)
all of the above (47:50 - 47:54)
I didn't I do like building a team I (47:51 - 47:58)
think it's it's very obvious on paper (47:54 - 48:00)
just like the the trading card game like (47:58 - 48:02)
like I have a lot of experience with (48:00 - 48:04)
competitive stuff with the trading card (48:02 - 48:05)
game I mean I played a competitively (48:04 - 48:07)
competitively for three years and if you (48:05 - 48:08)
were listening to the podcast during (48:07 - 48:10)
that time we probably talked a lot more (48:08 - 48:14)
TCG than we do now but both the TCG in (48:10 - 48:15)
the video game like things things always (48:14 - 48:17)
look better on paper than they do in (48:15 - 48:19)
execution so you can spend like a week (48:17 - 48:21)
making a team and then it just doesn't (48:19 - 48:25)
work at all in execution and I guess (48:21 - 48:28)
because I all my Pokemon is is is (48:25 - 48:31)
streamed on Twitch I have to also be (48:28 - 48:33)
entertaining and deal with an audience (48:31 - 48:37)
and I think what's more aggravating than (48:33 - 48:40)
losing is your audience being like oh (48:37 - 48:42)
you need to make all these changes when (48:40 - 48:45)
it's the first time you need it and if (48:42 - 48:47)
I've learned anything from like the TCG (48:45 - 48:49)
it's just because you've lost one match (48:47 - 48:51)
doesn't mean you need to change five (48:49 - 48:53)
cards in your deck because consistency (48:51 - 48:57)
is so important in matches whether it's (48:53 - 49:02)
TCG or video game related also I am a (48:57 - 49:04)
very competitive person and I get tilted (49:02 - 49:08)
pretty easy this is the truest words (49:04 - 49:10)
ever out of your mouth and the first (49:08 - 49:14)
step is admitting it I I have gotten (49:10 - 49:17)
better at accepting that you know if you (49:14 - 49:19)
know you have the advantage and all of a (49:17 - 49:22)
sudden you get frozen because of the 10% (49:19 - 49:25)
chance to freeze you know and your heart (49:22 - 49:27)
you would have won but you know that 10% (49:25 - 49:30)
freeze while it is aggravating you at (49:27 - 49:32)
least know in the back of your head that (49:30 - 49:34)
you played correctly up to that point (49:32 - 49:37)
where chance seemed to take over and (49:34 - 49:40)
chance happens a lot in the video game (49:37 - 49:40)
I'll tell you (49:40 - 49:44)
the head yep it's a random number (49:40 - 49:46)
generator Fein oh I wasn't makes it fun (49:44 - 49:48)
I would have won that match if they (49:46 - 49:55)
didn't get five critical zero so I've (49:48 - 49:58)
gotten better at it um I think for me (49:55 - 50:01)
I'm very bad at understanding how they (49:58 - 50:04)
open and so that that puts you at a (50:01 - 50:06)
pretty huge disadvantage where I think I (50:04 - 50:08)
got really good at that in the trading (50:06 - 50:10)
card game of how to open perfectly and (50:08 - 50:14)
how to prepare for things but boy the (50:10 - 50:15)
whole like competitive world is such a (50:14 - 50:19)
time sink on top of the competitive (50:15 - 50:22)
aspect which pushes people away (50:19 - 50:24)
yeah but slack has tournaments all the (50:22 - 50:26)
time to answer your question yeah join (50:24 - 50:29)
slack they're doing all kinds of weird (50:26 - 50:31)
things there there there are self (50:29 - 50:36)
efficient self-sufficient yeah well goes (50:31 - 50:42)
our pokemon of the week well it's brawl (50:36 - 50:46)
discombobulated what was it like two (50:42 - 50:50)
weeks ago yeah three weeks ago who knows (50:46 - 50:56)
I was talking about the fact that you (50:50 - 50:58)
can only play sword and shield during (50:56 - 51:00)
the daytime until the game is over the (50:58 - 51:04)
Sun never sets on Galler I mean (51:00 - 51:05)
technically it does but you're in a (51:04 - 51:07)
hotel does you're forced into a hotel (51:05 - 51:08)
room and you're not allowed to do (51:07 - 51:10)
anything at night not allowed to see (51:08 - 51:15)
those dark dark starry skies and so you (51:10 - 51:17)
couldn't evolve any Pokemon that evolved (51:15 - 51:22)
at night and my question was why are (51:17 - 51:24)
there so many dark types that only (51:22 - 51:26)
evolve at night what's the deal dark (51:24 - 51:28)
types like Weavile (51:26 - 51:32)
and a lowland Radek aid and abs to goon (51:28 - 51:34)
that's how we say it in the midst (51:32 - 51:36)
Midwest (51:34 - 51:36)
Oh obstacle oh yeah you know no no oh (51:38 - 51:45)
yeah (51:42 - 51:45)
the you could find this Pokemon at the (51:45 - 51:51)
lake of outrage if there's a sandstorm (51:49 - 51:53)
going on which is completely irrelevant (51:51 - 51:55)
to anything to do with this Pokemon (51:53 - 51:56)
because it's going to get hurt in a (51:55 - 52:01)
sandstorm and it also shares its ability (51:56 - 52:04)
with its psychic cousin although it's (52:01 - 52:06)
super effective against its a second (52:04 - 52:08)
cousin so well who was the Pokemon last (52:06 - 52:11)
week two weeks ago I'm doing circles (52:08 - 52:18)

complete collection of eeveelutions that (52:30 - 52:35)
I only caught at the lake of Rage (52:32 - 52:38)
outraged me to not evolve a single Eevee (52:35 - 52:40)
in this game and that's how I got all of (52:38 - 52:46)
them my daily pick up a rock walk wander (52:40 - 52:48)
and get a rock get a rock get an (52:46 - 52:50)

where he sells ya items yeah (53:03 - 53:08)
Evie cannot evolve and do s beyond or (53:06 - 53:10)
Umbreon in FireRed and LeafGreen (53:08 - 53:13)
due to their lack of time system in (53:10 - 53:15)
order to obtain them and add them to (53:13 - 53:16)
your pokedex (53:15 - 53:18)
you must trade them from ruby sefar or (53:16 - 53:21)
emerald evolve there and then trade them (53:18 - 53:24)
back or you have to get Colosseum or (53:21 - 53:28)
Yale darkness see that's how they get (53:24 - 53:30)
you to always buy born bye bye bye bye (53:28 - 53:34)
bye and I do according to the diamond in (53:30 - 53:36)
Perl pokedex Umbreon Glaceon and Leafeon (53:34 - 53:39)
have identical footprints Umbreon is the (53:36 - 53:41)
only non psychic pokémon to have the (53:39 - 53:44)
ability synchronize oh I wish I had (53:41 - 53:46)
known that (53:44 - 53:51)
Umbreon was designed by Atsuko nin nin (53:46 - 53:54)
Tschida who designed pikachu and (53:51 - 53:56)
Charmander Charmeleon Charizard fun fact (53:54 - 53:59)
not bad because that Umbreon designs (53:56 - 54:01)
pretty choice is very as a design (53:59 - 54:07)
sylveon as well I'm Brienne is tied with (54:01 - 54:10)
mega Gyarados and Hoopa and bound for (54:07 - 54:13)
the highest special defense of all dark (54:10 - 54:17)
types silviana stop for the highest (54:13 - 54:20)
special defense or tied with sylveon (54:17 - 54:22)
tied with Leafeon for the louis-based (54:20 - 54:25)
special attack of all evil ooh shion's (54:22 - 54:29)
and in the year of Pokemon poll (54:25 - 54:32)
presented by the Pokemon company in 2020 (54:29 - 54:34)
Umbreon was voted the most popular Gen 2 (54:32 - 54:38)
Pokemon and the most popular Eevee (54:34 - 54:42)
evolution receiving 67,000 votes (54:38 - 54:47)
dang take that Umbreon haters who could (54:42 - 54:49)
hate an Umbreon that's soft and fluffy (54:47 - 54:52)
are they soft and fluffy (54:49 - 54:55)
it all looks off wait sealskin to me (54:52 - 54:57)
prize with seal skin is surprisingly (54:55 - 54:58)
soft and fluffy (54:57 - 55:01)
two things see here one thing seals and (54:58 - 55:03)
kittens have in common is they're soft (55:01 - 55:06)
and fluffiness that's true (55:03 - 55:10)
alright do you want another always I was (55:06 - 55:13)
890 of them everybody you get an (55:10 - 55:15)
additional clue this week because this (55:13 - 55:18)
Pokemon was relevant last week but I get (55:15 - 55:20)
to do it last week so now it's (55:18 - 55:23)
irrelevant but you get what you get cuz (55:20 - 55:31)
I ain't writing more here we go (55:23 - 55:33)
I recently been feeling nostalgic for my (55:31 - 55:36)
80s R&B jams and added new additions (55:33 - 55:38)
album new addition to my iTunes library (55:36 - 55:41)
in doing so I had begun to wonder (55:38 - 55:43)
whether the biggest single from that (55:41 - 55:44)
album (55:43 - 55:47)
mr. telephone man would even be (55:44 - 55:49)
comprehensible to our younger audience (55:47 - 55:53)
what is a telephone man what is six one (55:49 - 55:56)
one why would an operator say please (55:53 - 55:59)
hang up and place your call again what (55:56 - 56:03)
is a party line there are several other (55:59 - 56:05)
almost incomprehensible references in (56:03 - 56:08)
the song and yet it is still a bop (56:05 - 56:11)
in the same way other once essential (56:08 - 56:14)
pokemon have gone by the wayside need (56:11 - 56:17)
someone to surf nah I have a bike for (56:14 - 56:21)
that fly me from spot to spot no we take (56:17 - 56:23)
air taxis here (56:21 - 56:25)
this week's pokemons made its debut in (56:23 - 56:29)
2006 and has some viability for about 10 (56:25 - 56:30)
years (56:29 - 56:32)
when it was then made redundant as its (56:30 - 56:34)
particular skills were no longer (56:32 - 56:37)
necessary we can't quite say that it was (56:34 - 56:40)
sent out to pasture but maybe back to (56:37 - 56:41)
the dam instead (56:40 - 56:44)
unlike slowpoke this week's pokemons (56:41 - 56:47)
tale was never eaten in the game unlike (56:44 - 56:49)
its pre evolution it has never been made (56:47 - 56:52)
out of peanut butter in real world (56:49 - 56:54)
Canada though there is a sweet fried (56:52 - 56:56)
dough treat made in the fashion of this (56:54 - 56:59)
pokemons tale you can also eat the real (56:56 - 57:02)
thing though many recipes recommend (56:59 - 57:04)
cooking the tale over high heat and (57:02 - 57:07)
serving it with beans here in Minnesota (57:04 - 57:09)
some trappers would hunt this week's (57:07 - 57:12)
Pokemon for its tail and its fur but (57:09 - 57:14)
unfortunately there are not enough (57:12 - 57:16)
trapped each year to prevent this (57:14 - 57:18)
rodents population from becoming (57:16 - 57:21)
problematic some fascinating facts (57:18 - 57:24)
though its nose and ears seal closed (57:21 - 57:28)
when it goes underwater its nictitating (57:24 - 57:31)
membrane allows it to see underwater (57:28 - 57:34)
without irritation its lips actually (57:31 - 57:37)
close behind its front teeth so that it (57:34 - 57:39)
can hold things in its mouth without (57:37 - 57:42)
drowning there you go that's all your (57:39 - 57:44)
clues that's all you need to know to (57:42 - 57:47)
guess the Pokemon of the week well (57:44 - 57:52)
