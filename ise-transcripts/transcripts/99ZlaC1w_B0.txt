well i i don't i'm sure as somebody who (3:20 - 3:24)
went through the wedding process i'm (3:23 - 3:26)

so that's all i got i'm sure i'm (5:29 - 5:33)
forgetting something but let's (5:32 - 5:36)
get into some pokemon news (5:33 - 5:38)
[Music] (5:36 - 5:41)
let's start with the raid battle (5:38 - 5:44)
news and i'm not talking about sword and (5:41 - 5:45)
shield (5:44 - 5:47)
i'm talking about the pokemon trading (5:45 - 5:49)
card game (5:47 - 5:53)
max raid battle uh print and play (5:49 - 5:56)
did you print it did you play it no (5:53 - 5:57)
because i don't have (5:56 - 6:00)
a printer because i don't have a printer (5:57 - 6:00)
either (6:00 - 6:02)
the printers i have access to i don't (6:00 - 6:04)
have access to right now (6:02 - 6:06)
so what let me know when it's time for (6:04 - 6:08)
me to say what blows my mind about this (6:06 - 6:10)
particular concept (6:08 - 6:11)
okay well let me tell you what it is if (6:10 - 6:13)
you haven't heard it's on (6:11 - 6:14)
it's if you just go to pokemon.com it's (6:13 - 6:16)
like one of their big buttons on the (6:14 - 6:19)
website so it's pretty hard to miss but (6:16 - 6:20)
it says (6:19 - 6:22)
the pokemon trading card game raid (6:20 - 6:24)
battle is a fun and exciting game that (6:22 - 6:26)
lets you experience the pokemon trading (6:24 - 6:27)
card game in a new way (6:26 - 6:30)
by using your tcg collection and either (6:27 - 6:32)
a digital raid battle assistant or (6:30 - 6:33)
printable material from the site you and (6:32 - 6:34)
your friends can (6:33 - 6:36)
work together to take down powerful (6:34 - 6:38)
dynomax or gigantomax pokemon (6:36 - 6:40)
they have a like a three minute very (6:38 - 6:42)
well produced i think high (6:40 - 6:44)
quality trailer explaining it showing (6:42 - 6:45)
you how to play (6:44 - 6:48)
getting your hype uh they built a (6:45 - 6:50)
calculator website where you can (6:48 - 6:52)
it'll tell you whose turn it is you can (6:50 - 6:54)
hit the draw card button you can see (6:52 - 6:55)
what you're fighting against you don't (6:54 - 6:57)
have to print any of this out you could (6:55 - 6:58)
print it out (6:57 - 7:00)
completely free it there's a lot of (6:58 - 7:02)
thought put into this (7:00 - 7:04)
it says in order to play you need four (7:02 - 7:06)
players each with two pokemon (7:04 - 7:09)
you will battle uh either a gigantomax (7:06 - 7:11)
or a dynomax boss (7:09 - 7:13)
you'll have a deck of 20 boss cards (7:11 - 7:15)
you'll have a deck of cheer cards you'll (7:13 - 7:17)
have knockout counters play mat (7:15 - 7:19)
you can download all of that completely (7:17 - 7:21)
for free including the boss cards (7:19 - 7:23)
there's a built-in calculators of saying (7:21 - 7:25)
if it's gonna be like a three star boss (7:23 - 7:27)
or a four or five star boss (7:25 - 7:30)
it's actually really cool and it kind of (7:27 - 7:32)
came out of nowhere (7:30 - 7:34)
i wouldn't be surprised if this was (7:32 - 7:36)
going to be like a box (7:34 - 7:39)
product in the future (7:36 - 7:39)
i could see it as a box product this is (7:40 - 7:43)
something i would actually do with (7:42 - 7:45)
people this sounds fun to me (7:43 - 7:48)
yeah it seems it seems fun i mean uh you (7:45 - 7:49)
can take any of the pokemon cards you (7:48 - 7:50)
have (7:49 - 7:52)
you can take a base at charizard you can (7:50 - 7:53)
take a shiny charizard from hidden fades (7:52 - 7:55)
you can take uh (7:53 - 7:58)
uh look there's no no shortage of (7:55 - 7:58)
charizard (7:58 - 8:00)
cards in the last 20 some years uh and (7:58 - 8:02)
you can use any of them (8:00 - 8:04)
uh but by picking any of those cards you (8:02 - 8:05)
calculate the boss by (8:04 - 8:07)
you know the strongest attack on that (8:05 - 8:09)
card so it rounds it up (8:07 - 8:10)
uh it's it's it's really cool it's (8:09 - 8:12)
really thought out i guess you can't (8:10 - 8:14)
really complain it's completely free (8:12 - 8:16)
they built i can complain they built a (8:14 - 8:18)
website that's completely print and play (8:16 - 8:21)
although with the with the amount of tcg (8:18 - 8:23)
tcg stuff they've been doing with the (8:21 - 8:25)
the trainer toolkit (8:23 - 8:27)
the the new battle boxes with the (8:25 - 8:28)
jirachi's and (8:27 - 8:30)
and then the what's the other thing they (8:28 - 8:33)
did i'm blanking on what it is (8:30 - 8:35)
anyways it just oh the the bad the the (8:33 - 8:36)
getting started (8:35 - 8:39)
target exclusive i forget what that box (8:36 - 8:41)
was called where it came with the (8:39 - 8:41)
trainer (8:41 - 8:45)
the like the board the the tcg board (8:41 - 8:46)
game but it was just like (8:45 - 8:49)
yeah oh yeah yeah it was that guy i (8:46 - 8:51)
still need to get a copy of that i went (8:49 - 8:53)
i went to two targets today (8:51 - 8:55)
no copies at any of these targets not (8:53 - 8:56)
that i i just want it for collection (8:55 - 8:57)
purposes (8:56 - 9:00)
but it pretty much comes out july 27th (8:57 - 9:00)
this (9:00 - 9:03)
would be a a box product that would be (9:00 - 9:06)
good for families or just i don't know (9:03 - 9:06)
let's (9:06 - 9:08)
battle some max raids around the table (9:06 - 9:10)
as we're waiting for pizza to get (9:08 - 9:11)
delivered it seems really cool (9:10 - 9:14)
i don't look no one has a printer you (9:11 - 9:15)
have a printer (9:14 - 9:17)
you have a printer if you're like you (9:15 - 9:18)
work at home and you have to send a lot (9:17 - 9:19)
of mail (9:18 - 9:21)
and or you have kids those are like (9:19 - 9:22)
probably the two main reasons (9:21 - 9:24)
you have a printer i mean i have a (9:22 - 9:26)
printer but it doesn't have any ink (9:24 - 9:28)
nobody wants to buy ink for that thing (9:26 - 9:29)
nobody wants to buy ink you're better (9:28 - 9:31)
off just buying a new printer (9:29 - 9:32)
oh because it's usually cheaper than the (9:31 - 9:34)
ink believe me (9:32 - 9:37)
that has happened over black fridays (9:34 - 9:39)
where i was like oh i we don't have (9:37 - 9:42)
ink oh but there's a new printer i'll (9:39 - 9:44)
just buy the printer (9:42 - 9:48)
it's dumb all right so let's hear it (9:44 - 9:50)
number one oh june 21st is when it was (9:48 - 9:52)
supposed to go on so it was exclusive at (9:50 - 9:53)
target (9:52 - 9:55)
it'll be at all stores may 31st it's (9:53 - 9:56)
everywhere yeah (9:55 - 10:00)
all right so just looking (9:56 - 10:03)
through my crystal ball peering into (10:00 - 10:05)
the minds of pokemon company (10:03 - 10:06)
international (10:05 - 10:10)
tcg scheme scheme strategy (10:06 - 10:13)
screen those dudes i (10:10 - 10:16)
what i see is that they are seeing (10:13 - 10:20)
a very clear downturn in the sale of (10:16 - 10:20)
physical (10:20 - 10:23)
product because people aren't going to (10:20 - 10:25)
local game stores they're not going (10:23 - 10:25)
pokemon league (10:25 - 10:27)
they're not paying the pack tax where (10:25 - 10:29)
you buy a pack of cards signing your way (10:27 - 10:30)
out of the store to say thank you for (10:29 - 10:32)
hosting pokemon league (10:30 - 10:35)
et cetera et cetera so they're like (10:32 - 10:37)
how can we create something that will (10:35 - 10:39)
get people to start buying (10:37 - 10:42)
cards and packs again and they come up (10:39 - 10:44)
with this concept and they're like (10:42 - 10:47)
this is kind of like a a play-at-home (10:44 - 10:47)
thing (10:47 - 10:49)
because we can't ask people to go to (10:47 - 10:52)
stores they can't do pokemon league (10:49 - 10:54)
but they can play at home but it (10:52 - 10:56)
requires four people (10:54 - 10:58)
so the whole problem with why you're not (10:56 - 11:00)
going to pokemon league you're still (10:58 - 11:01)
defeating the purpose (11:00 - 11:04)
unless you're a family of four well how (11:01 - 11:05)
many of those do we have (11:04 - 11:07)
because of the trailer and because of (11:05 - 11:08)
the website and because (11:07 - 11:10)
like this doesn't seem like they just (11:08 - 11:11)
rolled it out because of cove (11:10 - 11:13)
this seemed like they they were working (11:11 - 11:15)
on it for kind of a while (11:13 - 11:18)
i don't know what makes you think that (11:15 - 11:21)
you think that somebody yeah (11:18 - 11:22)
this is a concept somebody could have (11:21 - 11:24)
come up in in two weeks (11:22 - 11:26)
where they say we need to find a way to (11:24 - 11:28)
get people to use their physical trading (11:26 - 11:30)
cards since they can't go to stores and (11:28 - 11:32)
like let's brainstorm this and they're (11:30 - 11:34)
like well we've got max raids in the new (11:32 - 11:34)
game (11:34 - 11:36)
is there something we can do with max (11:34 - 11:38)
raids and etc etc go down the path yeah (11:36 - 11:40)
oh absolutely how many think of how many (11:38 - 11:42)
tabletop games have (11:40 - 11:46)
a uh like you know (11:42 - 11:48)
whatever what would you call it greg (11:46 - 11:50)
like (11:48 - 11:52)
but no no no like it's like the game (11:50 - 11:54)
master or the enemy (11:52 - 11:56)
is just this randomized deck of cards oh (11:54 - 11:57)
sure (11:56 - 11:59)
yeah yeah yeah that that like that's (11:57 - 12:01)
that's an existing concept that's not (11:59 - 12:04)
anything new and it's like you know just (12:01 - 12:05)
fit that into the pokemon world (12:04 - 12:08)
i would tend to agree with you if they (12:05 - 12:09)
didn't (12:08 - 12:12)
a complete dedicated website built for (12:09 - 12:13)
this and a (12:12 - 12:16)
pretty high-end trailer nothing better (12:13 - 12:16)
to do (12:16 - 12:19)
than sitting at home trying to avoid (12:16 - 12:21)
catching diseases (12:19 - 12:26)
i'm sure look (12:21 - 12:26)
it could have been something they were (12:29 - 12:33)
working on and then they prioritized it (12:30 - 12:34)
because of covid (12:33 - 12:38)
maybe it just seems very high production (12:34 - 12:41)
for like a last minute thing last m (12:38 - 12:44)
okay look last minute is as we're (12:41 - 12:44)
assuming (12:44 - 12:47)
they got to may and we're like well (12:44 - 12:51)
what should we do it's been four months (12:47 - 12:54)
yeah yeah four months is a long time (12:51 - 12:55)
when you're trying to scramble to come (12:54 - 12:57)
up with another product (12:55 - 12:58)
and i mean it could have been thrown (12:57 - 13:00)
together last minute i don't care (12:58 - 13:03)
it's actually something that would get (13:00 - 13:04)
me to play the tcg (13:03 - 13:07)
game like it right you now you're (13:04 - 13:08)
inspired to buy packs of cards because (13:07 - 13:10)
you want to be able to (13:08 - 13:12)
get do do a little max raid action yeah (13:10 - 13:14)
but but this type of game (13:12 - 13:16)
is the game i like to play with my (13:14 - 13:17)
friends i agree (13:16 - 13:19)
this is my problem though if i'm playing (13:17 - 13:22)
a board game i want to play a board game (13:19 - 13:23)
and i appreciate that they made a (13:22 - 13:25)
digital calculator (13:23 - 13:28)
whatever i get it's very cool um some (13:25 - 13:29)
people probably love that some people (13:28 - 13:30)
wanted that but i don't want like four (13:29 - 13:32)
of us to sit on one end of a table with (13:30 - 13:33)
like a macbook pro (13:32 - 13:35)
sitting at the other end like i want the (13:33 - 13:38)
reason i like playing the tcg is like (13:35 - 13:40)
holding the cards flipping the things (13:38 - 13:42)
rolling the dice and having just hitting (13:40 - 13:44)
like space bar on the computer doesn't (13:42 - 13:46)
scratch that itch well buy a printer man (13:44 - 13:48)
but but that's what i'm definitely not (13:46 - 13:49)
doing (13:48 - 13:52)
is buying a printer so (13:49 - 13:55)
it's free except for the 260 (13:52 - 13:58)
dollar printer scanner that you have to (13:55 - 13:59)
buy to be able to play the game yeah (13:58 - 14:01)
there is no free you will spend more (13:59 - 14:03)
than 20 dollars in ink here (14:01 - 14:04)
if they were to put this on the shelf (14:03 - 14:06)
access to like a fedex kinkos or (14:04 - 14:08)
something like that i tried to do (14:06 - 14:11)
kinko's one time go away (14:08 - 14:11)
way robbery for what they're charging (14:11 - 14:16)
you for ink at a kinkos (14:13 - 14:16)
say you're in a hotel and then use the (14:18 - 14:23)
business center (14:20 - 14:25)
possibly what i'm saying is that this is (14:23 - 14:27)
exciting and i would love (14:25 - 14:30)
to see a physical product on a shelf (14:27 - 14:33)
for 20 25 instant day one purchase for (14:30 - 14:34)
me (14:33 - 14:37)
also spoiler alert if you're going to go (14:34 - 14:39)
and just print all this stuff out you (14:37 - 14:41)
can print the tcg (14:39 - 14:44)
cards out too because nobody's watching (14:41 - 14:45)
you at home (14:44 - 14:46)
go on the website type in your favorite (14:45 - 14:48)
pokemon slash tg (14:46 - 14:50)
you'll get the image you can print it (14:48 - 14:51)
out ta-dah (14:50 - 14:54)
you have a card they're called proxies (14:51 - 14:56)
thank you sir (14:54 - 14:56)
so you can have any tcg card from (14:57 - 15:03)
the day the game came out there there (15:00 - 15:04)
this is un (15:03 - 15:06)
kind of related news but the the pokemon (15:04 - 15:07)
company (15:06 - 15:11)
recently did reach out to a couple (15:07 - 15:14)
influencers youtubers we might we may (15:11 - 15:15)
call them (15:14 - 15:19)
and they paid these youtubers to do (15:15 - 15:22)
um tcgo walkthrough videos (15:19 - 15:25)
so i i still think there is this (15:22 - 15:27)
battle academy was what the old the the (15:25 - 15:28)
board game was called (15:27 - 15:30)
yeah i i still think they're doing this (15:28 - 15:32)
big big push for (15:30 - 15:33)
i think it's obvious they're doing a big (15:32 - 15:35)
push for tcg stuff but i i (15:33 - 15:37)
this is cool i'm just i just would love (15:35 - 15:39)
a actual (15:37 - 15:41)
not print and play version but it's cool (15:39 - 15:43)
that they do offer (15:41 - 15:45)
like like i think both greg and will you (15:43 - 15:47)
know that like (15:45 - 15:49)
print and play doesn't really hurt (15:47 - 15:51)
physical purchases no (15:49 - 15:53)
print and play is what every kickstarter (15:51 - 15:54)
does to make sure people would be (15:53 - 15:56)
interested in a printed version uh and (15:54 - 15:58)
usually people who really like the game (15:56 - 16:00)
after printing and play it they are the (15:58 - 16:01)
ones that will spend the (16:00 - 16:04)
20 bucks to either the real version yep (16:01 - 16:07)
they want the high quality they want the (16:04 - 16:08)
cardboard they want the card stock they (16:07 - 16:10)
went the whole thing (16:08 - 16:12)
print and play is that like print of (16:10 - 16:14)
play is the warning shot of an actual (16:12 - 16:15)
product (16:14 - 16:17)
i still want to play it imagine if we (16:15 - 16:19)
could actually be in person (16:17 - 16:23)
i know it would be fun imagine if (16:19 - 16:26)
we could meet up (16:23 - 16:29)
at the um what is that place up in (16:26 - 16:31)

shirts that i want and (17:58 - 18:02)
i will buy none of them now because it's (18:00 - 18:04)
like if i go down the path of buying one (18:02 - 18:07)
then i'm buying like eight and i do not (18:04 - 18:08)
want to spend that money (18:07 - 18:12)
i have that same problem too 25 is a lot (18:08 - 18:15)
for a shirt in my opinion it's a (18:12 - 18:15)
i would really be into it if it was 25 (18:17 - 18:23)
and i could walk away with it right now (18:20 - 18:24)
like if i was at a convention and they (18:23 - 18:25)
were like 25 bucks and i was like well (18:24 - 18:26)
i'm here (18:25 - 18:28)

home and go (18:30 - 18:35)
um that's a lot see here's the thing (18:32 - 18:36)

buy brent the polti guy shirt which then (18:36 - 18:39)
will allow me to buy one (18:38 - 18:41)

the cliffhanger (24:31 - 24:35)
well hey they warned you beforehand they (24:32 - 24:36)
were doing 12 at a time (24:35 - 24:38)
they did but they didn't warn you that i (24:36 - 24:38)
was going to leave you on the (24:38 - 24:40)
cliffhanger (24:38 - 24:42)
like in a big one they got to keep you (24:40 - 24:43)

what is your uh well and greg you lived (24:43 - 24:48)
through the 80s (24:46 - 24:50)
when every season of every television (24:48 - 24:52)
show (24:50 - 24:55)
like may and the season would end on a (24:52 - 24:57)
huge cliffhanger and you would not (24:55 - 24:59)
be seeing sights of that show again (24:57 - 25:02)
until september until september and then (24:59 - 25:04)
it was a 50 50 shot if they picked that (25:02 - 25:07)
plot line back up again (25:04 - 25:08)
it's like well we didn't like how that (25:07 - 25:11)
went it was uh just a dream that (25:08 - 25:12)
somebody had in the shower (25:11 - 25:14)
next we should start leaving this show (25:12 - 25:15)
on a cliffhanger we (25:14 - 25:17)
yeah we what we do pokemon of the week (25:15 - 25:18)
oh yeah yeah (25:17 - 25:21)
uh great questions what do you think of (25:18 - 25:22)
uh (25:21 - 25:24)
journeys um you've watched all the (25:22 - 25:26)
pokemon anime (25:24 - 25:30)
yeah i think it's it's not the best one (25:26 - 25:33)
but what is possibly better there's a (25:30 - 25:35)
lot of very charming things about it (25:33 - 25:37)
um i think it had kind of a slow start (25:35 - 25:39)
but there hasn't (25:37 - 25:40)
one thing i've appreciated there hasn't (25:39 - 25:43)
been a ton of filler episodes (25:40 - 25:46)
but one thing i don't sort of i'm like (25:43 - 25:48)
you're just flying all around the world (25:46 - 25:50)
in like a couple of hours how small is (25:48 - 25:51)
this world (25:50 - 25:52)
because it's like we're just gonna pop (25:51 - 25:54)
over to galler and then come back to (25:52 - 25:55)
kanto and then we're gonna pop over to (25:54 - 25:57)
ho and they're gonna just (25:55 - 25:59)
pop right back it's just it's like (25:57 - 26:00)
two-hour trip you know they have (25:59 - 26:02)
teleportation in the pokemon universe (26:00 - 26:03)
not for (26:02 - 26:06)
humans you don't know that hey i can i (26:03 - 26:09)
could be a bigger part of the show (26:06 - 26:09)
i'm so i'm surprised at how much i like (26:09 - 26:14)
go i think go is a very good (26:12 - 26:17)
addition to the show i think the art (26:14 - 26:18)
style's (26:17 - 26:21)
fun i think most this i (26:18 - 26:23)
most of the ones so far haven't felt (26:21 - 26:24)
like this is just (26:23 - 26:27)
filler like you're just wasting my time (26:24 - 26:28)
i think it's (26:27 - 26:31)
been a very enjoyable ride yeah that (26:28 - 26:33)
yeah i noticed that too there wasn't i i (26:31 - 26:34)
saw the first six (26:33 - 26:37)
and uh they none of them felt like (26:34 - 26:39)
filler i would argue that the first (26:37 - 26:40)
three felt (26:39 - 26:42)
like they were doing too much honestly i (26:40 - 26:44)
was like whoa we're we're introducing (26:42 - 26:46)
characters real fast and we're yeah (26:44 - 26:48)
putting legendaries in episode two (26:46 - 26:50)
and we're moving yeah they're they just (26:48 - 26:52)
set you off although it is a (26:50 - 26:55)
little confusing and i get why people (26:52 - 26:57)
are confused because (26:55 - 27:00)
it sort of feels like they rebooted (26:57 - 27:03)
the universe and it takes a while before (27:00 - 27:05)
they acknowledge that ash has a past (27:03 - 27:09)
what they challenge it like episode two (27:05 - 27:10)
where you like (27:09 - 27:13)
see all his trophies original very first (27:10 - 27:15)
episode of the pokemon anime they (27:13 - 27:16)
introduced a legendary (27:15 - 27:18)
i mean yes that's true that's true yeah (27:16 - 27:20)
yeah but they like they they're on (27:18 - 27:23)
spoiler they ride lugia in the second (27:20 - 27:24)
episode they uh (27:23 - 27:26)
they're they're on lugia for a solid (27:24 - 27:28)
like five six minutes of that that's (27:26 - 27:30)
like 25 percent of the episode (27:28 - 27:32)
i mean like that was that was such a (27:30 - 27:34)
complaint of gen 5 of like pikachu (27:32 - 27:37)
losing the snivy and even though no one (27:34 - 27:39)
paid attention and like zechariah (27:37 - 27:40)
electrocuted pikachu and that's why (27:39 - 27:42)
pikachu was weak and everyone always (27:40 - 27:43)
thinks that there's like (27:42 - 27:46)
there's like this soft reboot i guess (27:43 - 27:46)
yeah (27:46 - 27:48)
that kind of happens where ash like (27:46 - 27:49)
leaves all his pokemon and then he (27:48 - 27:51)
he it's just him and pikachu and then he (27:49 - 27:53)
has to recollect and stuff (27:51 - 27:54)
but in the second episode like when they (27:53 - 27:56)
panned to his room you see his like (27:54 - 27:59)
alolan trophy right there like he won (27:56 - 28:01)
you see both the the championship trophy (27:59 - 28:02)
and the (28:01 - 28:06)
professor kakui trophy like right on his (28:02 - 28:07)
desk (28:06 - 28:10)
yeah but they also have him (28:07 - 28:12)
in the way he speaks and the way he's (28:10 - 28:13)
sort of characterized (28:12 - 28:16)
as if he's had no other experiences in (28:13 - 28:16)
his life (28:16 - 28:19)
it takes a while before like ash seems (28:16 - 28:21)
to remember that he's been to all of (28:19 - 28:22)
these places (28:21 - 28:25)
and and has spoken to professor oak (28:22 - 28:26)
before (28:25 - 28:29)
like is this weird disconnect of like (28:26 - 28:30)
you know (28:29 - 28:32)
because mr mime is there and these (28:30 - 28:33)
things are in the background that ash (28:32 - 28:34)
should have (28:33 - 28:37)
a lot more knowledge than he has in (28:34 - 28:39)
those first three episodes (28:37 - 28:41)
greg have you heard of the single-player (28:39 - 28:42)
rpg (28:41 - 28:46)
the thousand-year vampire no oh dear (28:42 - 28:49)
well there goes my whole my home (28:46 - 28:52)
you know i don't like vampires nothing (28:49 - 28:54)
about that title would tell me (28:52 - 28:56)
that i want to go read there's another (28:54 - 28:58)
version that's like about an artifact or (28:56 - 28:58)
something (28:58 - 29:02)
i don't know basically it's a it's a (28:58 - 29:04)
role-playing game that you play alone (29:02 - 29:05)
and you get prompts and then you write (29:04 - 29:07)
things down but the whole thing is as (29:05 - 29:09)
you go through (29:07 - 29:11)
it tells you at certain points to erase (29:09 - 29:13)
portions of things you wrote previously (29:11 - 29:15)
because your memory is fallible (29:13 - 29:18)
that is ash yeah now i want to play that (29:15 - 29:20)
game is there a non-vampire version no (29:18 - 29:22)
there it's i think there's one about an (29:20 - 29:23)
artifact yes all right i'm gonna look (29:22 - 29:24)
that up (29:23 - 29:25)
i'll do an artifact no i'm down with (29:24 - 29:28)
that no leeches for me (29:25 - 29:31)
i will get you into vampire no (29:28 - 29:34)
culture you won't they're leeches (29:31 - 29:36)
that's fine there are mosquitos (29:34 - 29:38)
attractive leeches (29:36 - 29:40)
i have i've two thoughts walking away (29:38 - 29:42)
from the first six (29:40 - 29:45)
episodes number one is is that there's a (29:42 - 29:48)
clear distinction between ash and go (29:45 - 29:53)
absolutely go is the logical thinker (29:48 - 29:56)
and he cares about catching pokemon and (29:53 - 29:58)
they make it very obvious that ash does (29:56 - 29:59)
not care about that (29:58 - 30:02)
i think 20 plus years of history has (29:59 - 30:02)
proven (30:02 - 30:05)
ash does not care about catching but (30:02 - 30:06)
they really hit (30:05 - 30:09)
home that ashes more of an emotional per (30:06 - 30:12)
uh like an emotional thinker um and i (30:09 - 30:12)
think that is (30:12 - 30:15)
that that in retro in like in hindsight (30:12 - 30:16)
is is also very clear (30:15 - 30:18)
like when he battles it is very (30:16 - 30:20)
emotional and not as logical (30:18 - 30:21)
as you would think and i think that's (30:20 - 30:23)
why so many adults get frustrated with (30:21 - 30:23)
ash (30:23 - 30:26)
because they're like well why would you (30:23 - 30:29)
use that move it's not super effective (30:26 - 30:30)
even though like all of these people (30:29 - 30:32)
have accidentally forgotten typing while (30:30 - 30:34)
playing through a game and or (30:32 - 30:37)
and or clicked the wrong well about yes (30:34 - 30:41)
yes they do a very good job of (30:37 - 30:44)
having go and ash in conflict (30:41 - 30:47)
in a way that reinforces both their (30:44 - 30:48)
characters that is one (30:47 - 30:49)
really good thing that they do in this (30:48 - 30:52)
series and then you know go (30:49 - 30:55)
at one point go says that his (30:52 - 30:59)
goal is to catch to fill out the pokedex (30:55 - 31:02)
right uh and ultimately his goal is to (30:59 - 31:04)
catch mew but he's gonna work backwards (31:02 - 31:06)
and then they ask ash what his goal is (31:04 - 31:07)
and they say (31:06 - 31:09)
what they always say is ash wants to be (31:07 - 31:11)
a pokemon master and i (31:09 - 31:12)
they've done this multiple times in the (31:11 - 31:14)
anime but they they do it here again (31:12 - 31:17)
they never define what that is no they (31:14 - 31:18)
don't (31:17 - 31:20)
and they they this is like the third or (31:18 - 31:21)
fourth time in like 20 years where (31:20 - 31:23)
somebody's like what's a pokemon master (31:21 - 31:24)
and (31:23 - 31:26)
ash just changes the subject yeah he's (31:24 - 31:27)
like you know (31:26 - 31:29)
and don't don't worry about it this goes (31:27 - 31:31)
into my second point is i'm just so (31:29 - 31:34)
sick of hearing that like oh this is how (31:31 - 31:35)
they're going to retire ash and it's (31:34 - 31:37)
going to be go from here on out (31:35 - 31:40)
i anyone saying that has one probably (31:37 - 31:41)
not seen this anime (31:40 - 31:44)
and probably didn't watch any of sun and (31:41 - 31:46)
moon where they have 18 (31:44 - 31:48)
other characters with ash and ash isn't (31:46 - 31:50)
even in half the episodes (31:48 - 31:52)
they're not going to retire ash if you (31:50 - 31:54)
see ash interacting with go it's very (31:52 - 31:56)
obvious that like (31:54 - 31:58)
he ain't going anywhere and because they (31:56 - 32:00)
keep not defining what a pokemon (31:58 - 32:03)
master is he will always have something (32:00 - 32:04)
to work towards (32:03 - 32:08)
true true without a specific goal you'll (32:04 - 32:09)
never achieve that goal (32:08 - 32:13)
uh no i disagree it's you set in your (32:09 - 32:14)
heart what you believe (32:13 - 32:16)
mastery to be you don't allow it to be (32:14 - 32:18)
defined by something external (32:16 - 32:21)
i just read an article earlier of the (32:18 - 32:22)
same thing of like oh this is where (32:21 - 32:24)
they're going to make (32:22 - 32:26)
uh ash exit i one i don't think go works (32:24 - 32:27)
on his own (32:26 - 32:30)
just like i don't think moana gladion (32:27 - 32:31)
sophocles (32:30 - 32:33)
mallow like they don't work on their own (32:31 - 32:35)
ash is the character that ties everyone (32:33 - 32:36)
together (32:35 - 32:39)
and he's doing it here go is would not (32:36 - 32:41)
be nearly as interesting if ash wasn't (32:39 - 32:42)
contradicting what he was saying (32:41 - 32:44)
and i think the article said something (32:42 - 32:46)
like well if ash defeats leon (32:44 - 32:50)
he'll have nowhere else to go really you (32:46 - 32:51)
don't think there's going to be another (32:50 - 32:54)
champion in another region (32:51 - 32:56)
after gallery i know and then after that (32:54 - 32:57)
one (32:56 - 33:00)
and then after that one there's no way (32:57 - 33:03)
ash's way ash and pikachu were so iconic (33:00 - 33:04)
they would be shooting themselves in the (33:03 - 33:06)
foot if they ripped them from the anime (33:04 - 33:08)
they're not going to retire them why (33:06 - 33:09)
would they (33:08 - 33:11)
there's no there's nothing there's (33:09 - 33:12)
nothing (33:11 - 33:15)
marketing wise to be gained by retiring (33:12 - 33:17)
your most iconic characters (33:15 - 33:20)
unless something happens to (33:17 - 33:24)
besmirch the good name of ash ash is (33:20 - 33:25)
going nowhere (33:24 - 33:28)
they could even have an ash versus red (33:25 - 33:29)
battle (33:28 - 33:31)
that would still remain low people's (33:29 - 33:33)
minds (33:31 - 33:36)
i would i want to see that special i (33:33 - 33:36)
like it though i think (33:36 - 33:39)
yeah i'm i'm really enjoying it i think (33:36 - 33:41)
the uh having it on netflix having 12 (33:39 - 33:43)
episodes brand new to watch right away (33:41 - 33:45)
the song is a banger (33:43 - 33:48)
oh it's so good i'm not huge on the (33:45 - 33:50)
animation i personally like thicker (33:48 - 33:52)
lines in my animation um (33:50 - 33:54)
and the lines are a little little thin (33:52 - 33:56)
here but that's just that's just um (33:54 - 33:59)
visual stuff it doesn't really take away (33:56 - 34:00)
no uh but i i like the (33:59 - 34:02)
not not as thick as black and white g's (34:00 - 34:06)
they really beybladed out that episode (34:02 - 34:08)
that was the style i will say that the (34:06 - 34:11)
this animation style allows them (34:08 - 34:14)
to portray more activity like (34:11 - 34:17)
it everything feels much faster with (34:14 - 34:18)
these characters they don't (34:17 - 34:20)
they feel lighter and faster because (34:18 - 34:22)
they are on so many lines (34:20 - 34:24)
oh yeah yeah light light is a good word (34:22 - 34:26)
yeah we got a little bit more news (34:24 - 34:28)
so we will take a quick break and we (34:26 - 34:31)

pokemon masters news full (35:05 - 35:12)
disclosure i am partnered with dna (35:09 - 35:15)
volume 12. from the map message from the (35:12 - 35:17)
pokemon masters team (35:15 - 35:19)
uh greetings trainers we are the (35:17 - 35:21)
producers of pokemon masters (35:19 - 35:24)
sasake and tsuya gucci (35:21 - 35:26)
here with a new message we will discuss (35:24 - 35:28)
the one-year anniversary celebration and (35:26 - 35:30)
other updates happening in august (35:28 - 35:32)
we will also talk about the stamina (35:30 - 35:34)
system and other (35:32 - 35:36)
planned improvements to existing (35:34 - 35:37)
features (35:36 - 35:39)
updates through late august thanks to (35:37 - 35:42)
professor bella's tireless research on (35:39 - 35:42)
paseo (35:42 - 35:44)
new pokemon eggs have been available (35:42 - 35:45)
since late june (35:44 - 35:47)
the player character has the option to (35:45 - 35:49)
form sink pairs with the pokemon that (35:47 - 35:50)
hatch from these eggs it doesn't take (35:49 - 35:51)
too many resources (35:50 - 35:54)
to strengthen a hatch pokemon as it does (35:51 - 35:55)
to strengthen other pokemon (35:54 - 35:58)
so we hope you train a lot of them and (35:55 - 35:59)
try them tri-forming (35:58 - 36:02)
various teams in a dish additionally (35:59 - 36:04)
there is a bug type event scheduled soon (36:02 - 36:06)
it's your chance to get eggs that will (36:04 - 36:08)
hatch scyther and pincer (36:06 - 36:10)
so don't miss out if you include a (36:08 - 36:11)
player characters (36:10 - 36:13)
sink pair or bug type sing pairs in your (36:11 - 36:14)
team you (36:13 - 36:16)
your chance of getting eggs will (36:14 - 36:18)
increase (36:16 - 36:20)
so you recommend to train those things i (36:18 - 36:22)
didn't actually that i missed that the (36:20 - 36:23)
first time i read this news i didn't (36:22 - 36:23)
know that (36:23 - 36:27)
okay cool i wish i had uh guzma uh now (36:23 - 36:30)
that this has been said (36:27 - 36:30)
your chances of including an egg will (36:30 - 36:34)
increase that this is probably my (36:31 - 36:36)
only complaint about the eggs is i like (36:34 - 36:37)
the eggs a lot (36:36 - 36:39)
i think they're great they just don't (36:37 - 36:40)
drop frequently enough (36:39 - 36:42)
there is also a very rare chance that (36:40 - 36:44)
some eggs will hatch a shiny pokemon we (36:42 - 36:46)
encourage everyone to get a lot of eggs (36:44 - 36:48)
to find their perfect partner so i don't (36:46 - 36:48)
know (36:48 - 36:49)
specifically what that means we know (36:48 - 36:51)
right now the only shiny in the eggs is (36:49 - 36:52)
tauros (36:51 - 36:55)
um i'm assuming it's either going to be (36:52 - 36:57)
scyther or pincer or both (36:55 - 36:58)
i don't know if they're removing tauros (36:57 - 36:59)
i don't know if they're just adding (36:58 - 37:01)
cytherm pincer and they're taking away (36:59 - 37:04)
i guess we don't know any of that per (37:01 - 37:05)
their press release (37:04 - 37:07)
this will this will get uh this will get (37:05 - 37:09)
everyone to come back to masters (37:07 - 37:11)
we have already seen stephen paired with (37:09 - 37:12)
metagross (37:11 - 37:15)
and next he'll be teaming with alolan (37:12 - 37:16)
sandslash (37:15 - 37:19)
there is one more seasonal sink pair (37:16 - 37:21)
that will appear so look out to find out (37:19 - 37:22)
who (37:21 - 37:25)
they are so this is the second time (37:22 - 37:27)
they've done seasonal they did a holiday (37:25 - 37:30)
a christmas rosa yep and a christmas (37:27 - 37:31)
cyborg (37:30 - 37:35)
they're doing a very sporty (37:31 - 37:38)
short wearing t-shirt wearing steven (37:35 - 37:39)
stone here (37:38 - 37:41)
i'm into this steven stone this is the (37:39 - 37:42)
stephen stone that i want (37:41 - 37:45)
this is and uh you know they the alolan (37:42 - 37:47)
sand slash very cool (37:45 - 37:50)
also the steel type really fits steven (37:47 - 37:51)
stone in my opinion (37:50 - 37:53)
who do we think the other seasonal pair (37:51 - 37:55)
is is it going to be obvious and is it (37:53 - 37:55)
going to be (37:55 - 37:59)
like swimsuit cynthia no (37:55 - 38:02)
but then again i have no idea i mean (37:59 - 38:04)
i have no idea because the one that they (38:02 - 38:06)
picked before made no sense really (38:04 - 38:07)
either (38:06 - 38:09)
what cybold and rosa yeah well that's (38:07 - 38:11)
what that's all the story i guess (38:09 - 38:13)
they're going to tell a story here they (38:11 - 38:15)
can tell a story between any two (38:13 - 38:16)
characters like (38:15 - 38:20)
the entire field is wide open (38:16 - 38:20)
i mean the obvious why else is the (38:20 - 38:24)
obvious pit i don't think they would (38:23 - 38:26)
because wallace is already very summery (38:24 - 38:30)
and watery yeah like wallace is already (38:26 - 38:32)
primed and the thing is i don't think (38:30 - 38:34)
i've even seen anybody hint as to what (38:32 - 38:36)
they think it is like (38:34 - 38:39)
maybe it's swimsuit misty we don't have (38:36 - 38:40)
a sigma misty do we (38:39 - 38:43)
no we don't we we still know that cigna (38:40 - 38:44)
green and blue are coming and they still (38:43 - 38:47)
haven't dropped that on us yet (38:44 - 38:49)
and now i'm sure everyone was saving (38:47 - 38:51)
their gems for those but now (38:49 - 38:53)
steven stone is a very popular character (38:51 - 38:56)
yeah i want i want the steven stone i do (38:53 - 38:56)
i do too (38:56 - 38:59)
i don't know who they would pick i mean (38:56 - 39:02)
that like if they wanted to do (38:59 - 39:04)
cynthia i don't know who they would pick (39:02 - 39:05)
for the partner (39:04 - 39:08)
yeah that's the uh even if you predict (39:05 - 39:09)
the psychic lady uh (39:08 - 39:13)
like lady yeah sabrina (39:09 - 39:13)
they share a sure house on the unova (39:13 - 39:17)
coast no probably yeah (39:15 - 39:20)
not sabrina no no it's the one who wakes (39:17 - 39:22)
up from like a rose (39:20 - 39:26)
oh what oh oh her name (39:22 - 39:28)
she's the elite four member yeah she's (39:26 - 39:29)
sleeping yeah (39:28 - 39:32)
she's super sleepy all the time caitlyn (39:29 - 39:36)
caitlin there you go necklace i (39:32 - 39:38)
i don't know who she's gonna the they (39:36 - 39:41)
could be musharna for all i know (39:38 - 39:42)
i mean they could they could take (39:41 - 39:44)
friends with cynthia so (39:42 - 39:46)
yeah she is really good good friends in (39:44 - 39:47)
the 80s way (39:46 - 39:49)
we're we're all in agreement that (39:47 - 39:51)
lesbian friends (39:49 - 39:53)
[Laughter] (39:51 - 39:55)
we're we're all in agreement that cybold (39:53 - 39:57)
is not a popular character (39:55 - 40:00)
no no although (39:57 - 40:02)
maybe one of the most memorable elite (40:00 - 40:05)
four members in california (40:02 - 40:07)
but that's not saying much oh gosh their (40:05 - 40:10)
elite four was actually pretty bad (40:07 - 40:12)
you're right i mean because caitlyn was (40:10 - 40:13)
in two (40:12 - 40:16)
games correct was she yeah black black (40:13 - 40:18)
and black she was in platinum (40:16 - 40:19)
and then she was in platinum and then (40:18 - 40:21)
she was in black and white (40:19 - 40:23)
they could they could do wolf rick i (40:21 - 40:24)
don't know (40:23 - 40:28)
no i mean no i mean i'm living for (40:24 - 40:29)
wilfred (40:28 - 40:32)
for wilfred's summer outfit but bryson (40:29 - 40:33)
man summer outfit (40:32 - 40:36)
yeah yeah um i don't know if bryson will (40:33 - 40:37)
scream summer (40:36 - 40:39)
what they would do steven's own screen (40:37 - 40:42)
summer he's got an ice metal type for (40:39 - 40:43)
the summer yeah no that's good (40:42 - 40:46)
i feel like there's a theme there i can (40:43 - 40:48)
i can dig this (40:46 - 40:52)
making shave ice brycen would be like (40:48 - 40:53)
halloween (40:52 - 40:55)
because he's an actor he wants to you (40:53 - 40:57)
know dress up and stuff (40:55 - 41:01)
nice nice stereotypes yeah bryson man (40:57 - 41:02)
knows (41:01 - 41:04)
knows what it is i don't know what that (41:02 - 41:05)
i don't know what it (41:04 - 41:08)
is but bryson man has that all right (41:05 - 41:12)
top contenders red blue cynthia okay (41:08 - 41:14)
zero caitlyn no way this is why i (41:12 - 41:16)
brought up cybold they're probably gonna (41:14 - 41:18)
pick a character that no one cares about (41:16 - 41:19)
to make them (41:18 - 41:21)
somewhat relevant wait red and blue are (41:19 - 41:23)
still on their honeymoon (41:21 - 41:26)
yeah no rats in the game and blue is not (41:23 - 41:28)
well blue is but not significant not the (41:26 - 41:30)
cigna blue that everyone wants (41:28 - 41:32)
no which is why they're not gonna do (41:30 - 41:33)
blue they already got two blues they got (41:32 - 41:34)
the original blue (41:33 - 41:36)
and then they got the blue coming uh all (41:34 - 41:38)
right who doesn't matter (41:36 - 41:41)
candace candace already has some ice (41:38 - 41:42)
pokemon (41:41 - 41:45)
yeah but this is summer what is the (41:42 - 41:47)
order they could possibly gonna give her (41:45 - 41:50)
caddis will give a fire type for summer (41:47 - 41:52)
is there a fire aggression i feel like (41:50 - 41:54)
we have enough fire (41:52 - 41:57)
not yet attackers like that matters like (41:54 - 41:59)
we have enough all right (41:57 - 42:01)
oh summer giovanni do you remember (41:59 - 42:04)
giovanni he's always on the beach (42:01 - 42:05)
he was wearing the shorts with the (42:04 - 42:08)
persian summer giovanni that's what i'm (42:05 - 42:09)
guessing (42:08 - 42:11)
okay summer giovanni is a contender how (42:09 - 42:13)
about (42:11 - 42:17)
summer bugsy (42:13 - 42:17)
make you want him to be relevant yeah (42:18 - 42:21)
well okay (42:20 - 42:22)
what would the bugs eat what would the (42:21 - 42:24)
summer bug be (42:22 - 42:27)
the only fire bug type that's even worth (42:24 - 42:28)
anything of our vesta (42:27 - 42:29)
they're not going to give him larvae (42:28 - 42:30)
though they're saving that for all this (42:29 - 42:31)
yeah (42:30 - 42:33)
no they're saving uh volcano for over (42:31 - 42:35)
there you go (42:33 - 42:38)
give like ah yeah i don't what does (42:35 - 42:40)
bugsy have right now beedrill (42:38 - 42:43)
beedrill i mean he'll eventually (42:40 - 42:45)
he'll eventually get scyther right oh (42:43 - 42:46)
probably in this bug thing (42:45 - 42:47)
i'm going to say i'm going to say (42:46 - 42:50)
swimsuit giovanni that's my guess (42:47 - 42:54)
ooh either that or bikini james (42:50 - 42:57)
bikini james is my secret wish bikini (42:54 - 42:59)
james is also my secret wish (42:57 - 43:01)
i really want bikini james they will (42:59 - 43:03)
never do it they will never do it that (43:01 - 43:04)
that episode (43:03 - 43:06)
that that episode aired what like once (43:04 - 43:08)
in the united states before they pulled (43:06 - 43:08)
it (43:08 - 43:10)
i don't think it aired here oh you might (43:08 - 43:12)
think that (43:10 - 43:15)
if it did air they cut that scene that (43:12 - 43:17)
episode was ahead of its time (43:15 - 43:19)
way ahead of him (43:17 - 43:19)
put on tv after 10 p.m that that's what (43:21 - 43:28)
you mean by ahead of its time (43:23 - 43:28)
there is nothing above a pg (43:28 - 43:36)
13 rating in that episode nothing (43:32 - 43:38)
don't you judge james's lifestyle he's (43:36 - 43:40)
living his best life out there (43:38 - 43:42)
i'm sure would they would they introduce (43:40 - 43:44)
a new sink pair (43:42 - 43:46)
as the summer sink pair would they i (43:44 - 43:47)
don't know (43:46 - 43:50)
would they do summer bianca (43:47 - 43:50)
bianca like misty bianca's real lame (43:51 - 43:59)
how about summer karen yeah karen (43:55 - 44:01)
oh karen was a launch sink pair right so (43:59 - 44:03)
she has hound doom right now (44:01 - 44:04)
she has sound to him right now what (44:03 - 44:07)
would they give her what's karen's even (44:04 - 44:08)
deal (44:07 - 44:11)
like karen is calm she's very confident (44:08 - 44:14)
um she's a dark type trainer she gosh (44:11 - 44:15)
karen (44:14 - 44:18)
and uh what's her name what's the karen (44:15 - 44:18)
and claire (44:18 - 44:20)
always seem like very similar characters (44:18 - 44:22)
to me yeah (44:20 - 44:25)
would they give her absol no (44:22 - 44:28)
they would save absol for uh who had (44:25 - 44:30)
mega absolute x and y was that not (44:28 - 44:31)
serena but (44:30 - 44:33)
we already have we already know mega (44:31 - 44:35)
apps are going to different people (44:33 - 44:38)
what no sabrina would get mega absol and (44:35 - 44:39)
then deanto would get (44:38 - 44:43)
gardevoir and dianto's coming for the (44:39 - 44:45)
one year right that has to be (44:43 - 44:47)
yeah why absolutely why does it have to (44:45 - 44:48)
be (44:47 - 44:50)
because people are obsessed with the (44:48 - 44:51)
anthem and she has (44:50 - 44:54)
cardiff i don't know i don't know i (44:51 - 44:55)
don't get the (44:54 - 44:56)
obsession with the anthem i think the (44:55 - 44:58)
anthem is real boring (44:56 - 45:01)
what you you're real boring she (44:58 - 45:04)
she is also a weak part of the puzzle (45:01 - 45:05)
that is the week (45:04 - 45:08)
the weak part of x and y which was the (45:05 - 45:10)
entire story of that game (45:08 - 45:13)
wow okay so here's the here's here's (45:10 - 45:16)

persian (45:23 - 45:26)
murkrow there ain't nothing wild about (45:24 - 45:28)
murkrow because (45:26 - 45:32)
slow bro miss (45:28 - 45:35)

scraping the bottom of the barrel for a (45:35 - 45:40)
variety in stadium two (45:36 - 45:43)
but it's canon so karen sigma suit (45:40 - 45:45)

[Laughter] (45:59 - 46:05)
this is not allowed they have so many (46:03 - 46:07)
pokemon (46:05 - 46:09)
they cannot start repeating pokemon at (46:07 - 46:11)
this point (46:09 - 46:13)
even though they have even though they (46:11 - 46:16)
already have (46:13 - 46:16)
uh who miss davis isn't in the game (46:16 - 46:20)

anniversary like i'm sure i'm sure it'll (47:20 - 47:23)
be diantha because dantho is like the (47:22 - 47:24)
only (47:23 - 47:26)
person i think when you log into the (47:24 - 47:28)
game that you see (47:26 - 47:31)
that is not in the game yet yeah uh (47:28 - 47:32)
fantina has (47:31 - 47:33)
missed santina yeah she is the (47:32 - 47:36)
gymnastics diamond pearl right (47:33 - 47:38)
yeah yes yeah she has like the graveyard (47:36 - 47:39)
gym or whatever (47:38 - 47:43)
what is her gym not like headstones do (47:39 - 47:44)
you have to move through (47:43 - 47:46)
it's like a big drift loon i don't know (47:44 - 47:48)
what the inside's like (47:46 - 47:49)
i think the inside is like a bunch of (47:48 - 47:51)
like it's like a headstone maze that you (47:49 - 47:52)
walk through (47:51 - 47:55)
headstone head what did i head oh i said (47:52 - 47:57)
hedge (47:55 - 47:58)
all right i have to now i have to look (47:57 - 48:01)
this up oh (47:58 - 48:03)
no it's not they're just duskuls (48:01 - 48:05)
everywhere there are it's a duskull maze (48:03 - 48:05)
whose (48:05 - 48:08)
ghost gym has tombstones in it well i (48:05 - 48:09)
mean there's the (48:08 - 48:11)
literal graveyard in omega ruby alpha (48:09 - 48:14)
sapphire that you have to go through (48:11 - 48:16)
all right here here here here look it up (48:14 - 48:17)
is this what you're thinking of (48:16 - 48:19)
sending it to you because they are (48:17 - 48:21)
actually deskulls oh yeah that was what (48:19 - 48:23)
i was thinking of they are deskulls (48:21 - 48:26)
oh i guess my memory (48:23 - 48:28)
was worse than i thought oh yeah the (48:26 - 48:30)
trainers have the flashlights in that (48:28 - 48:31)
gym too yeah (48:30 - 48:33)
the gym was pretty good that's good jim (48:31 - 48:34)
because it was different in platinum (48:33 - 48:35)
because (48:34 - 48:38)
uh diamond and pearl was just uh go up (48:35 - 48:40)
the elevators and pick the doors (48:38 - 48:43)
and then in platinum it was the dusco (48:40 - 48:46)
maze the old elevator gym (48:43 - 48:48)
i'm pretty i'm pretty happy with masters (48:46 - 48:52)
um i think i'll be okay with this (48:48 - 48:56)
stan stamina system based on how i play (48:52 - 48:58)
i'm very worried that other people are (48:56 - 49:00)
not going to be happy with it (48:58 - 49:03)
yeah i uh but it has every exit point (49:00 - 49:06)
into wrong town and very few exit points (49:03 - 49:08)
into right town (49:06 - 49:11)
like stamina is not a great system (49:08 - 49:15)
so given how their first (49:11 - 49:18)
their first foray was not brilliant i do (49:15 - 49:18)
not have a (49:18 - 49:21)
high hope that the their stamina system (49:18 - 49:22)
is going to be very good but (49:21 - 49:24)
but they did say trial and they did say (49:22 - 49:26)
they are putting out feedback after it (49:24 - 49:27)
so (49:26 - 49:31)
well we'll see uh maybe it'll be great i (49:27 - 49:32)
i guess it also depends on (49:31 - 49:34)
you know what the reward difference is (49:32 - 49:36)
yeah all right there was a (49:34 - 49:39)
this came out of nowhere there was a uh (49:36 - 49:42)
aquatic pokemon event (49:39 - 49:44)

same exact sentence before (50:15 - 50:20)
to challenge these pokemon and max raid (50:18 - 50:21)

said that the whale lord was a two (50:27 - 50:32)
percent chance of being shiny (50:30 - 50:33)
if you don't know the shiny charm does (50:32 - 50:35)
not work on max raid battles so every (50:33 - 50:37)
max rate battle is a one in four (50:35 - 50:38)
thousand chance (50:37 - 50:41)
unless you join a manipulated raid where (50:38 - 50:42)
they have done the (50:41 - 50:45)
moving the clock to guarantee the shiny (50:42 - 50:46)
but yes (50:45 - 50:48)
technically the shiny charm doesn't work (50:46 - 50:50)
raids are one in four thousand so (50:48 - 50:54)
a two percent chance at wailord is (50:50 - 50:56)
incredibly high compared to the one in 4 (50:54 - 50:57)
000 chance (50:56 - 51:00)
it was only five star rates according to (50:57 - 51:01)
the data miner so three (51:00 - 51:03)
and four star wailords were the one in (51:01 - 51:05)
four thousand (51:03 - 51:08)
uh i was able to do about 12 (51:05 - 51:11)
hours of raiding on twitch with with the (51:08 - 51:11)
community (51:11 - 51:14)
and uh i found one myself and i was able (51:11 - 51:15)
to join (51:14 - 51:18)
somebody in chat's raid so i was lucky (51:15 - 51:19)
enough to find two whale lords (51:18 - 51:22)
i know greg you did some i think willow (51:19 - 51:24)
was out skateboarding all weekend (51:22 - 51:27)
yup i know shinies no (51:24 - 51:29)
as matter of fact as i i think i only (51:27 - 51:30)
ever got into two (51:29 - 51:34)
five-star whale lords i wasted (51:30 - 51:36)
you burnt through wishing pieces like (51:34 - 51:37)
they were candy no joke (51:36 - 51:41)
over 500 wishing pieces in in over the (51:37 - 51:42)
weekend (51:41 - 51:43)
then you should have seen ten shiny (51:42 - 51:47)
waylords i wish (51:43 - 51:49)
no cause the wishing pieces kept giving (51:47 - 51:52)
me four star lanterns (51:49 - 51:54)
the trick they did that's nothing i (51:52 - 51:55)
wished for (51:54 - 51:57)
compared to the magikarp event i think (51:55 - 51:59)
magikarp's shiny rate was about (51:57 - 52:04)
13 i want to say it was like between (51:59 - 52:06)
eight to 13 percent i can't remember i (52:04 - 52:08)
think it was it was pretty high it was (52:06 - 52:08)
yeah it was (52:08 - 52:10)
it was i think it was a one in eight (52:08 - 52:12)
chance which is (52:10 - 52:15)
i think actually 13 the difference is (52:12 - 52:16)
that (52:15 - 52:17)
magikarp could have been like three to (52:16 - 52:20)
five star it was just and already (52:17 - 52:21)
like literally every red felt like a (52:20 - 52:23)
magikarp raid (52:21 - 52:26)
uh where this was whale lord angelicon (52:23 - 52:28)
and sharpedo and mantine so like (52:26 - 52:33)
finding the whale lord was the hard part (52:28 - 52:35)
because based on my own wishing pieces (52:33 - 52:36)
like i said i burnt through (52:35 - 52:39)
500 that's not an exaggeration i only (52:36 - 52:41)
probably found (52:39 - 52:45)
maybe 15 or 16 five star wailords i (52:41 - 52:48)
found tons of three stars ton of tons of (52:45 - 52:49)
four stars but there was no point in (52:48 - 52:50)
doing them because i knew (52:49 - 52:52)
i was just wasting time at that point (52:50 - 52:54)
dead just go to a den drop a wishing (52:52 - 52:55)
piece not wailord (52:54 - 52:57)
uh walk five feet to a different den (52:55 - 52:59)
drop a wishing piece (52:57 - 53:01)
okay this one's not whaler to go back to (52:59 - 53:03)
the devil i like i just went between two (53:01 - 53:05)
dens and kept dropping wishing pieces (53:03 - 53:06)
back and forth (53:05 - 53:08)
i think the event was fun uh they didn't (53:06 - 53:11)
specifically say on pokemon.com why the (53:08 - 53:12)
event existed (53:11 - 53:15)
uh i did look it up in japan the third (53:12 - 53:19)
monday in july is marine day (53:15 - 53:22)
i'm assuming that's why these are (53:19 - 53:24)
marines it's as good a reason as any (53:22 - 53:26)
pokemon (53:24 - 53:28)
i love that they did this though but why (53:26 - 53:30)
why is there no announcement like a (53:28 - 53:31)
community why (53:30 - 53:33)
why because it's supposed to be japan (53:31 - 53:35)
only and then there was bleed over (53:33 - 53:37)
the non-japan part of the world it'd be (53:35 - 53:38)
nice to be like (53:37 - 53:39)
you know if they decide to do these once (53:38 - 53:41)
a month or whatever (53:39 - 53:44)
it'd be nice to give us a heads up there (53:41 - 53:45)
were there were so many people that were (53:44 - 53:46)
coming in (53:45 - 53:49)
to the twitch streams that were like (53:46 - 53:51)
where did this event come from why are (53:49 - 53:53)
they doing this event (53:51 - 53:55)
when does it end oh it ends tomorrow oh (53:53 - 53:57)
well geez i (53:55 - 53:58)
my weekend's already planned out i (53:57 - 54:00)
didn't i didn't know that there was (53:58 - 54:02)
going to be (54:00 - 54:04)
well stop having a social life number (54:02 - 54:05)
one (54:04 - 54:07)
and you'll have more time for pokemon i (54:05 - 54:09)
thought it was fun it was cool (54:07 - 54:10)
been nice if it would have been an extra (54:09 - 54:12)
day but nice if it would have been (54:10 - 54:16)
uh announced i'd been nice if uh (54:12 - 54:19)
they applied it to all weightlords (54:16 - 54:22)
and not just five stars but hey at least (54:19 - 54:23)
they're at least they're doing (54:22 - 54:25)
at least they're doing events which is (54:23 - 54:26)
which is always nice (54:25 - 54:27)
something we complained about on the (54:26 - 54:30)
show for years of why are we not getting (54:27 - 54:31)
events in these games (54:30 - 54:34)
i accidentally caught the poke the giant (54:31 - 54:35)
whalelord (54:34 - 54:37)
i've been told it comes back from (54:35 - 54:39)
trustworthy people (54:37 - 54:42)
they said that one day look i can't (54:39 - 54:43)
trust my twitch chat i'm gonna get it (54:42 - 54:44)
you have to trust yourself (54:43 - 54:47)
before again you're trustworthy people (54:44 - 54:49)
that's what i thought about animal (54:47 - 54:51)
crossing that's very true (54:49 - 54:53)
i have been told that the wailord comes (54:51 - 54:56)
back what triggers it i don't know (54:53 - 54:58)
i'm very upset my whalert is gone though (54:56 - 55:00)
well i ran into it (54:58 - 55:01)
and i didn't think i did and then for my (55:00 - 55:03)
brain was like oh you're in a (55:01 - 55:04)
you're an afraid thing and i'm like no (55:03 - 55:06)
this isn't right uh well i'm already in (55:04 - 55:08)
the battle if i knock it out i don't (55:06 - 55:10)
know if it stays there (55:08 - 55:11)
i'll just catch it and i'll see if it (55:10 - 55:13)
ever comes back i'm gonna test (55:11 - 55:15)
this twitch theory and it's so far been (55:13 - 55:17)
lies maybe (55:15 - 55:20)
they did maybe it's like mewtwo where if (55:17 - 55:21)
you catch mewtwo he doesn't come back (55:20 - 55:23)
but if you knock him out (55:21 - 55:26)
he comes back after the u.s u.s (55:23 - 55:28)
gamer says it does not come back you (55:26 - 55:30)
can't (55:28 - 55:32)
what about newsweek what does newsweek (55:30 - 55:33)
say (55:32 - 55:36)
gamespot game faqs this will be the (55:33 - 55:37)
question i'll have to ask (55:36 - 55:40)
the people who they're they claim that (55:37 - 55:42)
the waylord came back (55:40 - 55:44)
no because one of the people hey they're (55:42 - 55:45)
tier two (55:44 - 55:47)
that means they give me anything that (55:45 - 55:48)
means they give me more money than other (55:47 - 55:49)
people (55:48 - 55:53)
they said that not only to lie to you (55:49 - 55:55)
we all know the more money you give a (55:53 - 55:57)
person the more you're going to believe (55:55 - 55:58)
that person (55:57 - 56:01)
i give you vast sums of jeff bezos's (55:58 - 56:03)
money thank you very much (56:01 - 56:06)
and he's the richest person ever i was (56:03 - 56:06)
told (56:06 - 56:08)
now i'm remembering i was told by a tier (56:06 - 56:11)
two sub that they caught the wailord (56:08 - 56:13)
they have the they have it in their box (56:11 - 56:15)
their whaler came back (56:13 - 56:17)
and they provided pictures in the (56:15 - 56:19)
discord of (56:17 - 56:21)
their level 80 wailord caught on launch (56:19 - 56:22)
day (56:21 - 56:23)
and then them standing outside another (56:22 - 56:25)
wailord in their game (56:23 - 56:27)
these all either all these people are (56:25 - 56:29)
lying together (56:27 - 56:31)
or no one knows how waylord comes back (56:29 - 56:33)
then how does it come back (56:31 - 56:36)
i don't know i'll buy your lie if you (56:33 - 56:37)
can tell me (56:36 - 56:40)
what you did because photos are easily (56:37 - 56:41)
faked (56:40 - 56:43)
who's faking this information though (56:41 - 56:44)
who's being like (56:43 - 56:46)
he's not telling you the truth about (56:44 - 56:48)
time travel and animal crossing (56:46 - 56:50)
your twitch chat that's true yeah but (56:48 - 56:51)
the people have weird (56:50 - 56:53)
people have weird ex like oh i only went (56:51 - 56:55)
back i only went backwards in time (56:53 - 56:59)
that's not time (56:55 - 57:01)
like they could have just restarted the (56:59 - 57:02)
game (57:01 - 57:04)
yeah but they had the whale order in (57:02 - 57:06)
their inventory yeah because they put it (57:04 - 57:07)

group of friends here (59:24 - 59:28)
having such a great time we didn't feel (59:26 - 59:30)
like we needed another presence (59:28 - 59:33)
yeah i understand (59:30 - 59:37)
question of the week which is better (59:33 - 59:40)
quick claw or sharp beak let's have (59:37 - 59:41)
another (59:40 - 59:44)
question of the week (59:41 - 59:44)
ah this is from casey what mechanics do (59:45 - 59:48)
you want to come back (59:47 - 59:51)
in crown tundra sos horde sky (59:48 - 59:54)
competitions etc dexnav i like (59:51 - 59:57)
decks now could you repeat the question (59:54 - 59:58)
i'm sorry i (59:57 - 60:01)
did i i heard skye etc and i'm like (59:58 - 60:03)
wait now the whole rest of the question (60:01 - 60:04)
has been removed from my brain (60:03 - 60:06)
what mechanics would you want to come (60:04 - 60:08)
back in crown tundra (60:06 - 60:11)
sos horde sky battles except (60:08 - 60:15)
competitions etc a lot of the things (60:11 - 60:18)
they listed are native to the region (60:15 - 60:21)
like sky battles was native to alola sos (60:18 - 60:21)
they (60:21 - 60:23)
went out of their way to explain how (60:21 - 60:25)
this or sorry sky battles was native to (60:23 - 60:29)
kalos out of their way to (60:25 - 60:29)
so my favorite and i have no idea (60:37 - 60:43)
why they felt the need to make it so (60:40 - 60:46)
completely obscure and hard to use in (60:43 - 60:49)
subsequent games that it appeared in (60:46 - 60:52)
inverse battles yeah inverse battles are (60:49 - 60:55)
fun i also really like rotation battles (60:52 - 60:58)
yeah i would bring back dex nav and (60:55 - 60:59)
rotation battles (60:58 - 61:03)
oh don't look me your choice is like (60:59 - 61:06)
no my choice is none i don't want old (61:03 - 61:07)
mechanics (61:06 - 61:10)
i want new stuff to do i only knew stuff (61:07 - 61:12)
only news (61:10 - 61:14)
stuff look i actually know why well he's (61:12 - 61:15)
already gobbled those (61:14 - 61:18)
sos for exactly two or three years (61:15 - 61:21)
i don't need i don't need another (61:18 - 61:23)
pokemon to drop out the sky so i can one (61:21 - 61:24)
shot it over and over (61:23 - 61:27)
again i've done it it's fine it exists (61:24 - 61:29)
why do i want to do it more (61:27 - 61:31)
i don't people are so obsessed with old (61:29 - 61:32)
mechanics like oh (61:31 - 61:36)
i want horde battles to come back why (61:32 - 61:38)
you just looked at five pokemon and ran (61:36 - 61:40)
away because you can it's easier to get (61:38 - 61:41)
chinese that way (61:40 - 61:45)
yeah make a better method then (61:41 - 61:47)
some people find those things fun just (61:45 - 61:49)
because you do it for a living (61:47 - 61:51)
and what was once your hobby and passion (61:49 - 61:53)
is now your drudgery (61:51 - 61:55)
does not mean the rest of us find that (61:53 - 61:56)
to be true (61:55 - 61:59)
some of us like revisiting old things (61:56 - 62:01)
your games still work if you go back to (61:59 - 62:01)
them (62:01 - 62:03)
yeah but then i could see it in new (62:01 - 62:06)
graphics i could see it with new pokemon (62:03 - 62:08)
i could hoard battle yamper oh my god (62:06 - 62:09)
yes please (62:08 - 62:12)
heart battle yamper with a and one of (62:09 - 62:13)
the five (62:12 - 62:16)
is uh meowth it's like all the people (62:13 - 62:18)
who complain about tail whips animation (62:16 - 62:19)
but also (62:18 - 62:21)
never use tail whip also turned off (62:19 - 62:24)
animations when they beat the elite four (62:21 - 62:26)
i mean tails up animation should be (62:24 - 62:29)
changed because it's ruining the trees (62:26 - 62:32)
it is ruining the trees that's very true (62:29 - 62:32)
oh (62:32 - 62:35)
speaking of trees i liked that that uh (62:32 - 62:36)
mechanic in x and y (62:35 - 62:38)
where there were certain berries that (62:36 - 62:40)
would only fall out of trees if you (62:38 - 62:43)
use particular attacks yeah i like that (62:40 - 62:45)
they should bring that back that was fun (62:43 - 62:47)
yeah because it's like the environment (62:45 - 62:48)
there were certain like (62:47 - 62:50)
if you were in certain battles in (62:48 - 62:52)
certain locations if you looked at the (62:50 - 62:54)
background there were berry trees (62:52 - 62:56)
yeah and then if you had to use specific (62:54 - 62:58)
attacks that would then cause the (62:56 - 63:00)
berries to fall from those trees as part (62:58 - 63:01)
of the attack (63:00 - 63:02)
yeah and then you can pick them up after (63:01 - 63:03)
the end of the battle yeah it was a very (63:02 - 63:04)
cool (63:03 - 63:06)
mechanic i like that one because it made (63:04 - 63:08)
those environments feel more alive well (63:06 - 63:08)
the (63:08 - 63:10)
berry farming reached its pinnacle in x (63:08 - 63:12)
and y absolutely (63:10 - 63:15)
yeah i would want that to come back but (63:12 - 63:16)
not (63:15 - 63:20)
but in like a way farming yeah (63:16 - 63:22)
i i don't think that the sh i like that (63:20 - 63:24)
they tried something new but i don't (63:22 - 63:25)
know whose (63:24 - 63:27)
thought process it was to be like let's (63:25 - 63:30)
just make trainers shake trees (63:27 - 63:32)
and then most of the time squivet will (63:30 - 63:34)
come down and it will be annoying (63:32 - 63:37)
kids like shaking trees i would (63:34 - 63:39)
yeah i would want the i would want the (63:37 - 63:41)
farming stuff to come back in x and y (63:39 - 63:41)
but in (63:41 - 63:44)
in like a way where it felt like you (63:41 - 63:45)
were upgrading it (63:44 - 63:47)
in more of like a harvest moon way of (63:45 - 63:49)
like getting better watering cans or (63:47 - 63:50)
being able like the fertilizer stuff (63:49 - 63:52)
didn't really do anything (63:50 - 63:55)
yeah it did it was kind of more likely (63:52 - 63:57)
that your berries would hybridize (63:55 - 63:59)
one fertilizer took care of everything (63:57 - 64:01)
there was like 18 fertilizers but it (63:59 - 64:04)
really didn't matter which one you used (64:01 - 64:06)
well that is not true that is not true (64:04 - 64:08)
oh my gosh (64:06 - 64:10)
you just because you didn't pay (64:08 - 64:12)
attention doesn't mean that people (64:10 - 64:14)
didn't know how to use them properly oh (64:12 - 64:17)
i fertilized (64:14 - 64:20)
you better believe i fertilized nobody (64:17 - 64:22)
grew as many berries as will anderson (64:20 - 64:24)
i mean well if you're gonna go up (64:22 - 64:27)
against will the berry master anderson (64:24 - 64:29)
yeah then you had better have all of (64:27 - 64:31)
your ducks (64:29 - 64:34)
and your a fertilizer i mean not only (64:31 - 64:38)
did he master x and y but he (64:34 - 64:41)
completely killed all the berries in sun (64:38 - 64:42)
and moon (64:41 - 64:43)
what have you done i maxed out my (64:42 - 64:47)
berries in sun and moon for the record (64:43 - 64:49)
i didn't i i did like that they brought (64:47 - 64:51)
back (64:49 - 64:54)
radar in x and y but they also changed (64:51 - 64:58)
it it wasn't the same so i don't (64:54 - 65:00)
completely mind if they bring back stuff (64:58 - 65:01)
but it would be nice (65:00 - 65:04)
if it was more modernized or they (65:01 - 65:06)
changed it in a way (65:04 - 65:09)
improved improved yeah just not (65:06 - 65:09)
breathing (65:09 - 65:12)
because it's a new system and a new (65:09 - 65:13)
thing but they could keep an (65:12 - 65:15)
idea you know what they really need to (65:13 - 65:17)
bring back (65:15 - 65:22)
seasons yes please please please please (65:17 - 65:25)
you have weather and it doesn't it (65:22 - 65:27)
should affect the sauce book (65:25 - 65:29)
but there's no sauce book literally a (65:27 - 65:30)
game on (65:29 - 65:34)
the ds not even the 3ds (65:30 - 65:37)
the ds had weather day and night (65:34 - 65:40)
and seasons and that's been too hard to (65:37 - 65:44)
replicate on subsequent systems (65:40 - 65:44)
i mean didn't they remove day and night (65:44 - 65:48)
from hoenn gen 3 didn't have day and (65:46 - 65:49)
night did it (65:48 - 65:52)
did gen 3 didn't have day night because (65:49 - 65:53)
johto (65:52 - 65:56)
uh parents of kids playing jojo were (65:53 - 65:57)
real mad (65:56 - 66:00)
and so they killed it well the problem (65:57 - 66:02)
with like seasons and day and night and (66:00 - 66:04)
all that stuff is people just change (66:02 - 66:06)
their clock (66:04 - 66:09)
well not all people not all people kids (66:06 - 66:11)
didn't they stayed up too late and then (66:09 - 66:13)
their parents got mad and complained (66:11 - 66:15)
about gen 2 and so we didn't have it (66:13 - 66:16)
anymore in gen 3. (66:15 - 66:18)
people were impatient enough to wait two (66:16 - 66:20)
days for the sandstorm to change to get (66:18 - 66:23)
whatever i don't know whatever appeared (66:20 - 66:24)
in the wild area (66:23 - 66:27)
uh when it was only sandstorming umbria (66:24 - 66:31)
umbrella yeah yes (66:27 - 66:32)
i mean at least that's one of them yeah (66:31 - 66:34)
i don't know why but that was one of (66:32 - 66:35)
them (66:34 - 66:38)
will question of the week or every every (66:35 - 66:38)
week (66:38 - 66:42)
pokemon real hard time last week's (66:38 - 66:44)
pokemon of the week it was very short (66:42 - 66:48)
sweet simple this region exclusive (66:44 - 66:50)
bird-looking pokemon has an eighth note (66:48 - 66:53)
for a head and a metronome for a tale (66:50 - 66:56)
it was banned in global battle union (66:53 - 66:56)
because (66:56 - 67:00)
some people think it's fun to be rude (66:56 - 67:04)
who's that pokemon it's (67:00 - 67:04)
cramer ant oh of course yes well at (67:05 - 67:10)
least you got it's a bird (67:08 - 67:13)
you know grandma is a bird chat (67:10 - 67:17)
it is chat hot it's just how much you've (67:13 - 67:17)
been (67:17 - 67:22)
guessing for the past two years (67:17 - 67:22)
give me that trivia okay one shuffle (67:22 - 67:26)
icon (67:25 - 67:30)
amazing too shiny also amazing yeah chat (67:26 - 67:34)
shiny is pretty good prior to shiny chat (67:30 - 67:34)
i do (67:34 - 67:37)
i i was the first pokemon i radared (67:34 - 67:41)
in x and y successfully (67:37 - 67:46)
that's the key word successfully (67:41 - 67:48)
prior to gen 6 chat is the only pokemon (67:46 - 67:49)
whose cry was not (67:48 - 67:52)
altered when it faints or is sent out (67:49 - 67:53)
with a status (67:52 - 67:55)
condition despite having a significantly (67:53 - 67:58)
special higher special attack and speed (67:55 - 68:01)
chat's evs award attack points (67:58 - 68:03)
um in generation four the person in (68:01 - 68:05)
eterna city will trade a chat out in (68:03 - 68:07)
return for a weasel (68:05 - 68:10)
the chat's name is charap which is a (68:07 - 68:13)
mixture of the english and japanese name (68:10 - 68:14)
if this pokemon was obtained in an (68:13 - 68:17)
english version of diamond or x (68:14 - 68:19)
or diamond of pearl and traded to x and (68:17 - 68:20)
y (68:19 - 68:22)
the game will recognize chat to be (68:20 - 68:24)
japanese (68:22 - 68:26)
that's actually really cool uh chad is (68:24 - 68:28)
the only pokemon that is not legendary (68:26 - 68:31)
or mythical to be banned from generation (68:28 - 68:35)
five's global battle union (68:31 - 68:37)
this is likely due to chat's signature (68:35 - 68:39)
move of chatter (68:37 - 68:41)
alright are you ready for the new yes (68:39 - 68:43)
always ready for new (68:41 - 68:46)
everyone will know how greg ruined this (68:43 - 68:48)
by the time i get to the end (68:46 - 68:52)
i ruined nothing you don't know that yet (68:48 - 68:56)
greg and i met up today july 19 2020 (68:52 - 68:59)
to play pokemon go in a local park and (68:56 - 69:01)
we had a terrible time (68:59 - 69:03)
the weather was frightful both too sunny (69:01 - 69:05)
and too windy (69:03 - 69:07)
all of the other people in the park were (69:05 - 69:08)
horrible (69:07 - 69:10)
not making room on the path for us i (69:08 - 69:11)
felt very grim (69:10 - 69:14)
about our ability to enjoy the day i (69:11 - 69:14)
then had an (69:14 - 69:18)
awful realization a dire consequence of (69:14 - 69:21)
my wearing a tank top would be sunburn (69:18 - 69:23)
it was a frightening thought equally (69:21 - 69:24)
terrifying (69:23 - 69:26)
i was wearing flip-flops and we had (69:24 - 69:29)
planned to walk several miles (69:26 - 69:32)
i would soon develop horrifying blisters (69:29 - 69:35)
equally alarming greg wasn't doing too (69:32 - 69:36)
well either (69:35 - 69:39)
he had a distressing limp to his walk (69:36 - 69:41)
it was simply shocking how poorly this (69:39 - 69:43)
day had turned out (69:41 - 69:45)
pokemon go events have an appalling way (69:43 - 69:47)
of turning bad (69:45 - 69:50)
after a harrowing ride home i am finally (69:47 - 69:51)
safe (69:50 - 69:53)
i'm not reading that again that's all (69:51 - 69:55)
you can if you couldn't get it from that (69:53 - 69:57)
folks come on (69:55 - 69:59)
[Laughter] (69:57 - 70:01)
somebody's literally going to message me (69:59 - 70:04)
and they'll be like i have no idea (70:01 - 70:04)
that's our show if you have not (70:06 - 70:14)
uh if you forgot podcastawards.com (70:09 - 70:17)
uh anniversary project on july 31st (70:14 - 70:22)
what else is there go fest this weekend (70:17 - 70:24)
i will attempt to live stream it i want (70:22 - 70:25)
to (70:24 - 70:27)
commit my weekend to go fest but i also (70:25 - 70:28)
want to (70:27 - 70:31)
stream it but i don't want to sit in my (70:28 - 70:33)
office and do it so (70:31 - 70:35)
thinking of options somebody actually (70:33 - 70:37)
suggested going downtown milwaukee and (70:35 - 70:39)
renting a hotel room so i'm surrounded (70:37 - 70:41)
by pokestops and i could also stream it (70:39 - 70:42)
which actually (70:41 - 70:44)
it's not a bad idea it's not bad it's (70:42 - 70:46)
yeah and hotels actually aren't too (70:44 - 70:46)
expensive (70:46 - 70:49)
no not right now yeah air conditioning (70:46 - 70:51)
i'd be able to stream it (70:49 - 70:53)
or you can come stay at the hotel i'm (70:51 - 70:55)
gonna be at and then (70:53 - 70:57)
there are no pokestops down there are (70:55 - 70:58)
you sure (70:57 - 71:02)
i think so oh i'd have to look at that (70:58 - 71:02)
the one (71:02 - 71:04)
it's the one right the one that i'm (71:02 - 71:06)
always at (71:04 - 71:08)
oh if it's the one in brookfield then no (71:06 - 71:10)
that one has zero poke (71:08 - 71:11)
that one has one pokestop in the (71:10 - 71:13)
building but i i would want a place that (71:11 - 71:15)
would be (71:13 - 71:17)
this this is the hotel requirement would (71:15 - 71:18)
be at least one gym in reach and (71:17 - 71:19)
probably (71:18 - 71:22)
two pokestops in reach that would (71:19 - 71:24)
probably have to be the requirement (71:22 - 71:27)
hotel.com they are desperate i'm sure (71:24 - 71:29)
i'm sure they are (71:27 - 71:31)
i wonder if they list like pokestops and (71:29 - 71:33)
gyms (71:31 - 71:36)
check their linkedin (71:33 - 71:38)
[Music] (71:36 - 71:40)
you can always call the hotel and ask (71:38 - 71:42)
how many pokestops and gyms are (71:40 - 71:44)
reachable from your roof yeah (71:42 - 71:47)
fine find somebody who plays can i get a (71:44 - 71:48)
