true we went and rescued karem from the church of jesus christ latter-day saints that is what happened that's the gym that that she's residing at here was very happy to leave that area it was only slightly awkward because i'm pretty sure they were having a wedding there was something going on at the church that is true yep all right all right i was going to mention but i won't okay go ahead you

news [Music] let's start with the raid battle news and i'm not talking about sword and shield i'm talking about the pokemon trading card game max raid battle uh print and play did you print it did you play it no because i don't have a printer because i don't have a printer either the printers i have access to i don't have access to right now so what let me know when it's time for me to say what blows my mind about this particular concept okay well let me tell you what it is if you haven't heard it's on it's if you just go to pokemon.com it's like one of their big buttons on the website so it's pretty hard to miss but it says the pokemon trading card game raid battle is a fun and exciting game that lets you experience the pokemon trading card game in a new way by using your tcg collection and either a digital raid battle assistant or printable material from the site you and your friends can work together to take down powerful dynomax or gigantomax pokemon they have a like a three minute very well produced i think high quality trailer explaining it showing you how to play getting your hype uh they built a calculator website where you can it'll tell you whose turn it is you can hit the draw card button you can see what you're fighting against you don't have to print any of this out you could print it out completely free it there's a lot of thought put into this it says in order to play you need four players each with two pokemon you will battle uh either a gigantomax or a dynomax boss you'll have a deck of 20 boss cards you'll have a deck of cheer cards you'll have knockout counters play mat you can download all of that completely for free including the boss cards there's a built-in calculators of saying if it's gonna be like a three star boss or a four or five star boss it's actually really cool and it kind of came out of nowhere i wouldn't be surprised if this was going to be like a box product in the future i could see it as a box product this is something i would actually do with people this sounds fun to me yeah it seems it seems fun i mean uh you can take any of the pokemon cards you have you can take a base at charizard you can take a shiny charizard from hidden fades you can take uh uh look there's no no shortage of charizard cards in the last 20 some years uh and you can use any of them uh but by picking any of those cards you calculate the boss by you know the strongest attack on that card so it rounds it up uh it's it's it's really cool it's really thought out i guess you can't really complain it's completely free they built i can complain they built a website that's completely print and play although with the with the amount of tcg tcg stuff they've been doing with the the trainer toolkit the the new battle boxes with the jirachi's and and then the what's the other thing they did i'm blanking on what it is anyways it just oh the the bad the the getting started target exclusive i forget what that box was called where it came with the trainer the like the board the the tcg board game but it was just like yeah oh yeah yeah it was that guy i still need to get a copy of that i went i went to two targets today no copies at any of these targets not that i i just want it for collection purposes but it pretty much comes out july 27th this would be a a box product that would be good for families or just i don't know let's battle some max raids around the table as we're waiting for pizza to get delivered it seems really cool i don't look no one has a printer you have a printer you have a printer if you're like you work at home and you have to send a lot of mail and or you have kids those are like probably the two main reasons you have a printer i mean i have a printer but it doesn't have any ink nobody wants to buy ink for that thing nobody wants to buy ink you're better off just buying a new printer oh because it's usually cheaper than the ink believe me that has happened over black fridays where i was like oh i we don't have ink oh but there's a new printer i'll just buy the printer it's dumb all right so let's hear it number one oh june 21st is when it was supposed to go on so it was exclusive at target it'll be at all stores may 31st it's everywhere yeah all right so just looking through my crystal ball peering into the minds of pokemon company international tcg scheme scheme strategy screen those dudes i what i see is that they are seeing a very clear downturn in the sale of physical product because people aren't going to local game stores they're not going pokemon league they're not paying the pack tax where you buy a pack of cards signing your way out of the store to say thank you for hosting pokemon league et cetera et cetera so they're like how can we create something that will get people to start buying cards and packs again and they come up with this concept and they're like this is kind of like a a play-at-home thing because we can't ask people to go to stores they can't do pokemon league but they can play at home but it requires four people so the whole problem with why you're not going to pokemon league you're still defeating the purpose unless you're a family of four well how many of those do we have because of the trailer and because of the website and because like this doesn't seem like they just rolled it out because of cove this seemed like they they were working on it for kind of a while i don't know what makes you think that you think that somebody yeah this is a concept somebody could have come up in in two weeks where they say we need to find a way to get people to use their physical trading cards since they can't go to stores and like let's brainstorm this and they're like well we've got max raids in the new game is there something we can do with max raids and etc etc go down the path yeah oh absolutely how many think of how many tabletop games have a uh like you know whatever what would you call it greg like but no no no like it's like the game master or the enemy is just this randomized deck of cards oh sure yeah yeah yeah that that like that's that's an existing concept that's not anything new and it's like you know just fit that into the pokemon world i would tend to agree with you if they didn't a complete dedicated website built for this and a pretty high-end trailer nothing better to do than sitting at home trying to avoid catching diseases i'm sure look it could have been something they were working on and then they prioritized it because of covid maybe it just seems very high production for like a last minute thing last m okay look last minute is as we're assuming they got to may and we're like well what should we do it's been four months yeah yeah four months is a long time when you're trying to scramble to come up with another product and i mean it could have been thrown together last minute i don't care it's actually something that would get me to play the tcg game like it right you now you're inspired to buy packs of cards because you want to be able to get do do a little max raid action yeah but but this type of game is the game i like to play with my friends i agree this is my problem though if i'm playing a board game i want to play a board game and i appreciate that they made a digital calculator whatever i get it's very cool um some people probably love that some people wanted that but i don't want like four of us to sit on one end of a table with like a macbook pro sitting at the other end like i want the reason i like playing the tcg is like holding the cards flipping the things rolling the dice and having just hitting like space bar on the computer doesn't scratch that itch well buy a printer man but but that's what i'm definitely not doing is buying a printer so it's free except for the 260 dollar printer scanner that you have to buy to be able to play the game yeah there is no free you will spend more than 20 dollars in ink here if they were to put this on the shelf access to like a fedex kinkos or something like that i tried to do kinko's one time go away way robbery for what they're charging you for ink at a kinkos say you're in a hotel and then use the business center possibly what i'm saying is that this is exciting and i would love to see a physical product on a shelf for 20 25 instant day one purchase for me also spoiler alert if you're going to go and just print all this stuff out you can print the tcg cards out too because nobody's watching you at home go on the website type in your favorite pokemon slash tg you'll get the image you can print it out ta-dah you have a card they're called proxies thank you sir so you can have any tcg card from the day the game came out there there this is un kind of related news but the the pokemon company recently did reach out to a couple influencers youtubers we might we may call them and they paid these youtubers to do um tcgo walkthrough videos so i i still think there is this battle academy was what the old the the board game was called yeah i i still think they're doing this big big push for i think it's obvious they're doing a big push for tcg stuff but i i this is cool i'm just i just would love a actual not print and play version but it's cool that they do offer like like i think both greg and will you know that like print and play doesn't really hurt physical purchases no print and play is what every kickstarter does to make sure people would be interested in a printed version uh and usually people who really like the game after printing and play it they are the ones that will spend the 20 bucks to either the real version yep they want the high quality they want the cardboard they want the card stock they went the whole thing print and play is that like print of play is the warning shot of an actual product i still want to play it imagine if we could actually be in person i know it would be fun imagine if we could meet up at the um what is that place up in rosedale it's been so long remember fantasy fight gaming center and play this together yeah like the good old days speaking of products on shelves uh the pokemon center launched over 30 different shirts this week here's 30 shirts i don't know where did this backlog of shirts come from i have that it was just like i got this we're lacing shirts these people are sitting at home with nothing better to do well i mean nothing better to do except for print one crime rant shirt that they sold to the one person who would buy it and it wasn't steve yeah i mean they're back in stock now uh they also brought back the destination posters which was a hot thing uh they added a galler poster so you can get the if you bought the destination posters originally you can get the galler poster separately for 10 bucks if you didn't get them they're back in stock you get all eight regions for forty dollars they added some camping chairs they added jerseys team skull relax fit crew neck adult t-shirt classics ditto fitted dress shirt well okay we don't need to go through all of them all we have to do is mention that the gallerian wheezing shirt is fantastic it really is the women's uh polti geist tea party shirt incredible very good they have palo sand sandwiches and a sableye slice of cake on it it's uh very good there are so many shirts that i want and i will buy none of them now because it's like if i go down the path of buying one then i'm buying like eight and i do not want to spend that money i have that same problem too 25 is a lot for a shirt in my opinion it's a i would really be into it if it was 25 and i could walk away with it right now like if i was at a convention and they were like 25 bucks and i was like well i'm here might as well but the fact that i can look at it online from the comfort of my home and go um that's a lot see here's the thing now i'm convincing myself that i should buy brent the polti guy shirt which then will allow me to buy one shirt that i wanted because i'd be getting out again no free shipping over twenty dollars and this is the problem now i'm deep into completely convincing myself that i should buy these things so they're so super cute i'm kind of mad that the tea party is only in scoop networks because i really love that design yeah i like it too but i would not fit in that shirt oh that sable like cake pie no it's a it's very good cupcakes it's very good the phantom cupcake like this is the greatest design it's very good put it in men's you cowards put it in just a unisex t-shirt but now i still stand by this company does not have to make another video game in their life nope they could just keep doing merge did you all look at the karaoke relaxed fit one of them singing in the back it is so good chat jigglypuff loudred i don't know why chancey's there and meloda chancy likes to sing so cute and it's yellow which is my favorite color i can't do relax fit i want that slim fit shirt i want that just because your skeletal ribcage i got you but you're gonna cover with a hoodie anyways like what does the t-shirt matter we can't see it you're wearing a hoodie this is why i don't buy two percent oh man okay i gotta get off this website i gotta get out this website destination destination posters anyways those are probably the things that will sell out 40 bucks all eight posters they're pretty good yeah you have to frame them yourself you got to frame them yourself yeah i'm not going down that dark path i'm not doing it well greg just here's the same the thing to keep in mind i i won't even say no i'll make it even better for you for every one shirt you buy you have to throw away two i have to buy two shirts to throw away no would you stop rule shark dude from your current stock of shirts you have to find two to toss away to bring a new one into the home that's a dumb rule it works so well because it's number one if you love all the shirts you currently have you're not going to buy new shirts because you don't want to throw away into the ones you love if you don't love all the shirts that you have you now have an excuse to get rid of them and bring nice new things into you i know but that means i have like dig them out where i hid them so i don't have to see their ugliness in my house oh wow those poor shirts just let them be free into the universe stop keeping them in chains they know what they did they deserve to be there because they're ugly yes ugly also deserves happiness maybe that's what i believe i don't think any of the dating sites i'm on agree with me but sure they do we talked about it baskin robbins introduces pokemon ice cream treats this is from gamerant.com baskin robbins of the pokemon company have announced a joint venture to promote the

japan we have no clue when it's coming elsewhere it's just coming to netflix i actually wouldn't be surprised if they just send it it sent it straight to netflix yeah it's just coming to netflix let's just be real speaking of netflix i saw the first six episodes of uh pokemon journeys yeah i've seen them all and i'm mad at them why are you mad there's 12 episodes and they leave it on the cliffhanger well hey they warned you beforehand they were doing 12 at a time they did but they didn't warn you that i was going to leave you on the cliffhanger like in a big one they got to keep you coming back buddy what is your uh well and greg you lived through the 80s when every season of every television show like may and the season would end on a huge cliffhanger and you would not be seeing sights of that show again until september until september and then it was a 50 50 shot if they picked that plot line back up again it's like well we didn't like how that went it was uh just a dream that somebody had in the shower next we should start leaving this show on a cliffhanger we yeah we what we do pokemon of the week oh yeah yeah uh great questions what do you think of uh journeys um you've watched all the pokemon anime yeah i think it's it's not the best one but what is possibly better there's a lot of very charming things about it um i think it had kind of a slow start but there hasn't one thing i've appreciated there hasn't been a ton of filler episodes but one thing i don't sort of i'm like you're just flying all around the world in like a couple of hours how small is this world because it's like we're just gonna pop over to galler and then come back to kanto and then we're gonna pop over to ho and they're gonna just pop right back it's just it's like two-hour trip you know they have teleportation in the pokemon universe not for humans you don't know that hey i can i could be a bigger part of the show i'm so i'm surprised at how much i like go i think go is a very good addition to the show i think the art style's fun i think most this i most of the ones so far haven't felt like this is just filler like you're just wasting my time i think it's been a very enjoyable ride yeah that yeah i noticed that too there wasn't i i saw the first six and uh they none of them felt like filler i would argue that the first three felt like they were doing too much honestly i was like whoa we're we're introducing characters real fast and we're yeah putting legendaries in episode two and we're moving yeah they're they just set you off although it is a little confusing and i get why people are confused because it sort of feels like they rebooted the universe and it takes a while before they acknowledge that ash has a past what they challenge it like episode two where you like see all his trophies original very first episode of the pokemon anime they introduced a legendary i mean yes that's true that's true yeah yeah but they like they they're on spoiler they ride lugia in the second episode they uh they're they're on lugia for a solid like five six minutes of that that's like 25 percent of the episode i mean like that was that was such a complaint of gen 5 of like pikachu losing the snivy and even though no one paid attention and like zechariah electrocuted pikachu and that's why pikachu was weak and everyone always thinks that there's like there's like this soft reboot i guess yeah that kind of happens where ash like leaves all his pokemon and then he he it's just him and pikachu and then he has to recollect and stuff but in the second episode like when they panned to his room you see his like alolan trophy right there like he won you see both the the championship trophy and the professor kakui trophy like right on his desk yeah but they also have him in the way he speaks and the way he's sort of characterized as if he's had no other experiences in his life it takes a while before like ash seems to remember that he's been to all of these places and and has spoken to professor oak before like is this weird disconnect of like you know because mr mime is there and these things are in the background that ash should have a lot more knowledge than he has in those first three episodes greg have you heard of the single-player rpg the thousand-year vampire no oh dear well there goes my whole my home you know i don't like vampires nothing about that title would tell me that i want to go read there's another version that's like about an artifact or something i don't know basically it's a it's a role-playing game that you play alone and you get prompts and then you write things down but the whole thing is as you go through it tells you at certain points to erase portions of things you wrote previously because your memory is fallible that is ash yeah now i want to play that game is there a non-vampire version no there it's i think there's one about an artifact yes all right i'm gonna look that up i'll do an artifact no i'm down with that no leeches for me i will get you into vampire no culture you won't they're leeches that's fine there are mosquitos attractive leeches i have i've two thoughts walking away from the first six episodes number one is is that there's a clear distinction between ash and go absolutely go is the logical thinker and he cares about catching pokemon and they make it very obvious that ash does not care about that i think 20 plus years of history has proven ash does not care about catching but they really hit home that ashes more of an emotional per uh like an emotional thinker um and i think that is that that in retro in like in hindsight is is also very clear like when he battles it is very emotional and not as logical as you would think and i think that's why so many adults get frustrated with ash because they're like well why would you use that move it's not super effective even though like all of these people have accidentally forgotten typing while playing through a game and or and or clicked the wrong well about yes yes they do a very good job of having go and ash in conflict in a way that reinforces both their characters that is one really good thing that they do in this series and then you know go at one point go says that his goal is to catch to fill out the pokedex right uh and ultimately his goal is to catch mew but he's gonna work backwards and then they ask ash what his goal is and they say what they always say is ash wants to be a pokemon master and i they've done this multiple times in the anime but they they do it here again they never define what that is no they don't and they they this is like the third or fourth time in like 20 years where somebody's like what's a pokemon master and ash just changes the subject yeah he's like you know and don't don't worry about it this goes into my second point is i'm just so sick of hearing that like oh this is how they're going to retire ash and it's going to be go from here on out i anyone saying that has one probably not seen this anime and probably didn't watch any of sun and moon where they have 18 other characters with ash and ash isn't even in half the episodes they're not going to retire ash if you see ash interacting with go it's very obvious that like he ain't going anywhere and because they keep not defining what a pokemon master is he will always have something to work towards true true without a specific goal you'll never achieve that goal uh no i disagree it's you set in your heart what you believe mastery to be you don't allow it to be defined by something external i just read an article earlier of the same thing of like oh this is where they're going to make uh ash exit i one i don't think go works on his own just like i don't think moana gladion sophocles mallow like they don't work on their own ash is the character that ties everyone together and he's doing it here go is would not be nearly as interesting if ash wasn't contradicting what he was saying and i think the article said something like well if ash defeats leon he'll have nowhere else to go really you don't think there's going to be another champion in another region after gallery i know and then after that one and then after that one there's no way ash's way ash and pikachu were so iconic they would be shooting themselves in the foot if they ripped them from the anime they're not going to retire them why would they there's no there's nothing there's nothing marketing wise to be gained by retiring your most iconic characters unless something happens to besmirch the good name of ash ash is going nowhere they could even have an ash versus red battle that would still remain low people's minds i would i want to see that special i like it though i think yeah i'm i'm really enjoying it i think the uh having it on netflix having 12 episodes brand new to watch right away the song is a banger oh it's so good i'm not huge on the animation i personally like thicker lines in my animation um and the lines are a little little thin here but that's just that's just um visual stuff it doesn't really take away no uh but i i like the not not as thick as black and white g's they really beybladed out that episode that was the style i will say that the this animation style allows them to portray more activity like it everything feels much faster with these characters they don't they feel lighter and faster because they are on so many lines oh yeah yeah light light is a good word yeah we got a little bit more news so we will take a quick break and we will be right back dna kind of danced around the bush beat beat around the bush they could dance around it i don't know you don't understand dance dance dance dance dance around the bush dance around the bush dance around the bush [Music] [Music] dance [Music] pokemon masters news full disclosure i am partnered with dna volume 12. from the map message from the pokemon masters team uh greetings trainers we are the producers of pokemon masters sasake and tsuya gucci here with a new message we will discuss the one-year anniversary celebration and other updates happening in august we will also talk about the stamina system and other planned improvements to existing features updates through late august thanks to professor bella's tireless research on paseo new pokemon eggs have been available since late june the player character has the option to form sink pairs with the pokemon that hatch from these eggs it doesn't take too many resources to strengthen a hatch pokemon as it does to strengthen other pokemon so we hope you train a lot of them and try them tri-forming various teams in a dish additionally there is a bug type event scheduled soon it's your chance to get eggs that will hatch scyther and pincer so don't miss out if you include a player characters sink pair or bug type sing pairs in your team you your chance of getting eggs will increase so you recommend to train those things i didn't actually that i missed that the first time i read this news i didn't know that okay cool i wish i had uh guzma uh now that this has been said your chances of including an egg will increase that this is probably my only complaint about the eggs is i like the eggs a lot i think they're great they just don't drop frequently enough there is also a very rare chance that some eggs will hatch a shiny pokemon we encourage everyone to get a lot of eggs to find their perfect partner so i don't know specifically what that means we know right now the only shiny in the eggs is tauros um i'm assuming it's either going to be scyther or pincer or both i don't know if they're removing tauros i don't know if they're just adding cytherm pincer and they're taking away i guess we don't know any of that per their press release this will this will get uh this will get everyone to come back to masters we have already seen stephen paired with metagross and next he'll be teaming with alolan sandslash there is one more seasonal sink pair that will appear so look out to find out who they are so this is the second time they've done seasonal they did a holiday a christmas rosa yep and a christmas cyborg they're doing a very sporty short wearing t-shirt wearing steven stone here i'm into this steven stone this is the stephen stone that i want this is and uh you know they the alolan sand slash very cool also the steel type really fits steven stone in my opinion who do we think the other seasonal pair is is it going to be obvious and is it going to be like swimsuit cynthia no but then again i have no idea i mean i have no idea because the one that they picked before made no sense really either what cybold and rosa yeah well that's what that's all the story i guess they're going to tell a story here they can tell a story between any two characters like the entire field is wide open i mean the obvious why else is the obvious pit i don't think they would because wallace is already very summery and watery yeah like wallace is already primed and the thing is i don't think i've even seen anybody hint as to what they think it is like maybe it's swimsuit misty we don't have a sigma misty do we no we don't we we still know that cigna green and blue are coming and they still haven't dropped that on us yet and now i'm sure everyone was saving their gems for those but now steven stone is a very popular character yeah i want i want the steven stone i do i do too i don't know who they would pick i mean that like if they wanted to do cynthia i don't know who they would pick for the partner yeah that's the uh even if you predict the psychic lady uh like lady yeah sabrina they share a sure house on the unova coast no probably yeah not sabrina no no it's the one who wakes up from like a rose oh what oh oh her name she's the elite four member yeah she's sleeping yeah she's super sleepy all the time caitlyn caitlin there you go necklace i i don't know who she's gonna the they could be musharna for all i know i mean they could they could take friends with cynthia so yeah she is really good good friends in the 80s way we're we're all in agreement that lesbian friends [Laughter] we're we're all in agreement that cybold is not a popular character no no although maybe one of the most memorable elite four members in california but that's not saying much oh gosh their elite four was actually pretty bad you're right i mean because caitlyn was in two games correct was she yeah black black and black she was in platinum and then she was in platinum and then she was in black and white they could they could do wolf rick i don't know no i mean no i mean i'm living for wilfred for wilfred's summer outfit but bryson man summer outfit yeah yeah um i don't know if bryson will scream summer what they would do steven's own screen summer he's got an ice metal type for the summer yeah no that's good i feel like there's a theme there i can i can dig this making shave ice brycen would be like halloween because he's an actor he wants to you know dress up and stuff nice nice stereotypes yeah bryson man knows knows what it is i don't know what that i don't know what it is but bryson man has that all right top contenders red blue cynthia okay zero caitlyn no way this is why i brought up cybold they're probably gonna pick a character that no one cares about to make them somewhat relevant wait red and blue are still on their honeymoon yeah no rats in the game and blue is not well blue is but not significant not the cigna blue that everyone wants no which is why they're not gonna do blue they already got two blues they got the original blue and then they got the blue coming uh all right who doesn't matter candace candace already has some ice pokemon yeah but this is summer what is the order they could possibly gonna give her caddis will give a fire type for summer is there a fire aggression i feel like we have enough fire not yet attackers like that matters like we have enough all right oh summer giovanni do you remember giovanni he's always on the beach he was wearing the shorts with the persian summer giovanni that's what i'm guessing okay summer giovanni is a contender how about summer bugsy make you want him to be relevant yeah well okay what would the bugs eat what would the summer bug be the only fire bug type that's even worth anything of our vesta they're not going to give him larvae though they're saving that for all this yeah no they're saving uh volcano for over there you go give like ah yeah i don't what does bugsy have right now beedrill beedrill i mean he'll eventually he'll eventually get scyther right oh probably in this bug thing i'm going to say i'm going to say swimsuit giovanni that's my guess ooh either that or bikini james bikini james is my secret wish bikini james is also my secret wish i really want bikini james they will never do it they will never do it that that episode that that episode aired what like once in the united states before they pulled it i don't think it aired here oh you might think that if it did air they cut that scene that episode was ahead of its time way ahead of him put on tv after 10 p.m that that's what you mean by ahead of its time there is nothing above a pg 13 rating in that episode nothing don't you judge james's lifestyle he's living his best life out there i'm sure would they would they introduce a new sink pair as the summer sink pair would they i don't know would they do summer bianca bianca like misty bianca's real lame how about summer karen yeah karen oh karen was a launch sink pair right so she has hound doom right now she has sound to him right now what would they give her what's karen's even deal like karen is calm she's very confident um she's a dark type trainer she gosh karen and uh what's her name what's the karen and claire always seem like very similar characters to me yeah would they give her absol no they would save absol for uh who had mega absolute x and y was that not serena but we already have we already know mega apps are going to different people what no sabrina would get mega absol and then deanto would get gardevoir and dianto's coming for the one year right that has to be yeah why absolutely why does it have to be because people are obsessed with the anthem and she has cardiff i don't know i don't know i don't get the obsession with the anthem i think the anthem is real boring what you you're real boring she she is also a weak part of the puzzle that is the week the weak part of x and y which was the entire story of that game wow okay so here's the here's here's here's something for you kids karen in stadium two had a wild team all right let me hear you on umbreon persian murkrow there ain't nothing wild about murkrow because slow bro miss and electrode that sounds like they were scraping the bottom of the barrel for a variety in stadium two but it's canon so karen sigma suit halloween mystery this that so she's out of the writing for summer wait somebody already has miss revis who i i don't know the the diamond and pearl girl doesn't she the gym leader why can't two people have the same pokemon they have 800 pokemon [Laughter] this is not allowed they have so many pokemon they cannot start repeating pokemon at this point even though they have even though they already have uh who miss davis isn't in the game right now is it not is it not the one sink pair i did i didn't pull on that banner because i didn't care all right where's my list of sync pairs okay let me finish this press release okay i'm looking up these things here for july's update uh we've scheduled the following improvements for the late july update so this should this should actually be any day now uh so uh they're going to roll out the new training area and they're going to roll a trial launch of the new stamina system we're especially looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the trial launch of the stamina system so please give it a try we're going to put out another survey and we would appreciate your feedback as we make balance adjustments moving forward uh we will be bringing our next message as a video so scheduled for mid-august in it we will focus on the one-year anniversary celebration of masters we are also working hard to deliver updates and improvements we prioritize trainers feedback until next time thank you for playing masters they can't do just one character for the anniversary like i'm sure i'm sure it'll be diantha because dantho is like the only person i think when you log into the game that you see that is not in the game yet yeah uh fantina has missed santina yeah she is the gymnastics diamond pearl right yeah yes yeah she has like the graveyard gym or whatever what is her gym not like headstones do you have to move through it's like a big drift loon i don't know what the inside's like i think the inside is like a bunch of like it's like a headstone maze that you walk through headstone head what did i head oh i said hedge all right i have to now i have to look this up oh no it's not they're just duskuls everywhere there are it's a duskull maze whose ghost gym has tombstones in it well i mean there's the literal graveyard in omega ruby alpha sapphire that you have to go through all right here here here here look it up is this what you're thinking of sending it to you because they are actually deskulls oh yeah that was what i was thinking of they are deskulls oh i guess my memory was worse than i thought oh yeah the trainers have the flashlights in that gym too yeah the gym was pretty good that's good jim because it was different in platinum because uh diamond and pearl was just uh go up the elevators and pick the doors and then in platinum it was the dusco maze the old elevator gym i'm pretty i'm pretty happy with masters um i think i'll be okay with this stan stamina system based on how i play i'm very worried that other people are not going to be happy with it yeah i uh but it has every exit point into wrong town and very few exit points into right town like stamina is not a great system so given how their first their first foray was not brilliant i do not have a high hope that the their stamina system is going to be very good but but they did say trial and they did say they are putting out feedback after it so well we'll see uh maybe it'll be great i i guess it also depends on you know what the reward difference is yeah all right there was a this came out of nowhere there was a uh aquatic pokemon event including shiny whaler that happened over the weekend so as of you listening to this podcast that event was over it was about 48 to 72 hours long hit the beach this is off pokemon.com summertime it may bring the heat but pokemon sword and shield max raid battles are staying cool with the sudden appearance of seafaring pokemon through july 19th they posted this on july 17th uh you'll likely to find kingler mantine sharpedo whalelord jealous and pukemuku appearing in max raid battles if you're lucky you may encounter a shiny wailord i where have i heard that same exact sentence before to challenge these pokemon and max raid battles you need to connect your switch to the internets when you see a pillar of lights shining it'll be a max ray den blah blah blah the data miner said that the whale lord was a two percent chance of being shiny if you don't know the shiny charm does not work on max raid battles so every max rate battle is a one in four thousand chance unless you join a manipulated raid where they have done the moving the clock to guarantee the shiny but yes technically the shiny charm doesn't work raids are one in four thousand so a two percent chance at wailord is incredibly high compared to the one in 4 000 chance it was only five star rates according to the data miner so three and four star wailords were the one in four thousand uh i was able to do about 12 hours of raiding on twitch with with the community and uh i found one myself and i was able to join somebody in chat's raid so i was lucky enough to find two whale lords i know greg you did some i think willow was out skateboarding all weekend yup i know shinies no as matter of fact as i i think i only ever got into two five-star whale lords i wasted you burnt through wishing pieces like they were candy no joke over 500 wishing pieces in in over the weekend then you should have seen ten shiny waylords i wish no cause the wishing pieces kept giving me four star lanterns the trick they did that's nothing i wished for compared to the magikarp event i think magikarp's shiny rate was about 13 i want to say it was like between eight to 13 percent i can't remember i think it was it was pretty high it was yeah it was it was i think it was a one in eight chance which is i think actually 13 the difference is that magikarp could have been like three to five star it was just and already like literally every red felt like a magikarp raid uh where this was whale lord angelicon and sharpedo and mantine so like finding the whale lord was the hard part because based on my own wishing pieces like i said i burnt through 500 that's not an exaggeration i only probably found maybe 15 or 16 five star wailords i found tons of three stars ton of tons of four stars but there was no point in doing them because i knew i was just wasting time at that point dead just go to a den drop a wishing piece not wailord uh walk five feet to a different den drop a wishing piece okay this one's not whaler to go back to the devil i like i just went between two dens and kept dropping wishing pieces back and forth i think the event was fun uh they didn't specifically say on pokemon.com why the event existed uh i did look it up in japan the third monday in july is marine day i'm assuming that's why these are marines it's as good a reason as any pokemon i love that they did this though but why why is there no announcement like a community why why because it's supposed to be japan only and then there was bleed over the non-japan part of the world it'd be nice to be like you know if they decide to do these once a month or whatever it'd be nice to give us a heads up there were there were so many people that were coming in to the twitch streams that were like where did this event come from why are they doing this event when does it end oh it ends tomorrow oh well geez i my weekend's already planned out i didn't i didn't know that there was going to be well stop having a social life number one and you'll have more time for pokemon i thought it was fun it was cool been nice if it would have been an extra day but nice if it would have been uh announced i'd been nice if uh they applied it to all weightlords and not just five stars but hey at least they're at least they're doing at least they're doing events which is which is always nice something we complained about on the show for years of why are we not getting events in these games i accidentally caught the poke the giant whalelord i've been told it comes back from trustworthy people they said that one day look i can't trust my twitch chat i'm gonna get it you have to trust yourself before again you're trustworthy people that's what i thought about animal crossing that's very true i have been told that the wailord comes back what triggers it i don't know i'm very upset my whalert is gone though well i ran into it and i didn't think i did and then for my brain was like oh you're in a you're an afraid thing and i'm like no this isn't right uh well i'm already in the battle if i knock it out i don't know if it stays there i'll just catch it and i'll see if it ever comes back i'm gonna test this twitch theory and it's so far been lies maybe they did maybe it's like mewtwo where if you catch mewtwo he doesn't come back but if you knock him out he comes back after the u.s u.s gamer says it does not come back you can't what about newsweek what does newsweek say gamespot game faqs this will be the question i'll have to ask the people who they're they claim that the waylord came back no because one of the people hey they're tier two that means they give me anything that means they give me more money than other people they said that not only to lie to you we all know the more money you give a person the more you're going to believe that person i give you vast sums of jeff bezos's money thank you very much and he's the richest person ever i was told now i'm remembering i was told by a tier two sub that they caught the wailord they have the they have it in their box their whaler came back and they provided pictures in the discord of their level 80 wailord caught on launch day and then them standing outside another wailord in their game these all either all these people are lying together or no one knows how waylord comes back then how does it come back i don't know i'll buy your lie if you can tell me what you did because photos are easily faked who's faking this information though who's being like he's not telling you the truth about time travel and animal crossing your twitch chat that's true yeah but the people have weird people have weird ex like oh i only went back i only went backwards in time that's not time like they could have just restarted the game yeah but they had the whale order in their inventory yeah because they put it in pokemon home restarted the game and that's not good speaking of saving uh this is off pokemon.com timed research encounter petal and summer style pikachu and pokemon go oh i got that pedal it photo bombed me oh nice yes it'll be photo bombing for the next couple days here i didn't get

we're gonna be bragging bragging week three here with the uh friendship hey well we're lucky friends has anybody cared yet or is it still screaming into the void oh i'm screaming in the void will and greg we're all lucky friends with each other yes you are correct we're all the luckiest of friends i'm a luckier friend because i couldn't cure him with my friend greg today yeah we did i remember not being invited to that yeah you weren't we didn't even we didn't even stop to think about you it was just this go do this because our group of friends here having such a great time we didn't feel like we needed another presence yeah i understand question of the week which is better quick claw or sharp beak let's have another question of the week ah this is from casey what mechanics do you want to come back in crown tundra sos horde sky competitions etc dexnav i like decks now could you repeat the question i'm sorry i did i i heard skye etc and i'm like wait now the whole rest of the question has been removed from my brain what mechanics would you want to come back in crown tundra sos horde sky battles except competitions etc a lot of the things they listed are native to the region like sky battles was native to alola sos they went out of their way to explain how this or sorry sky battles was native to kalos out of their way to so my favorite and i have no idea why they felt the need to make it so completely obscure and hard to use in subsequent games that it appeared in inverse battles yeah inverse battles are fun i also really like rotation battles yeah i would bring back dex nav and rotation battles oh don't look me your choice is like no my choice is none i don't want old mechanics i want new stuff to do i only knew stuff only news stuff look i actually know why well he's already gobbled those sos for exactly two or three years i don't need i don't need another pokemon to drop out the sky so i can one shot it over and over again i've done it it's fine it exists why do i want to do it more i don't people are so obsessed with old mechanics like oh i want horde battles to come back why you just looked at five pokemon and ran away because you can it's easier to get chinese that way yeah make a better method then some people find those things fun just because you do it for a living and what was once your hobby and passion is now your drudgery does not mean the rest of us find that to be true some of us like revisiting old things your games still work if you go back to them yeah but then i could see it in new graphics i could see it with new pokemon i could hoard battle yamper oh my god yes please heart battle yamper with a and one of the five is uh meowth it's like all the people who complain about tail whips animation but also never use tail whip also turned off animations when they beat the elite four i mean tails up animation should be changed because it's ruining the trees it is ruining the trees that's very true oh speaking of trees i liked that that uh mechanic in x and y where there were certain berries that would only fall out of trees if you use particular attacks yeah i like that they should bring that back that was fun yeah because it's like the environment there were certain like if you were in certain battles in certain locations if you looked at the background there were berry trees yeah and then if you had to use specific attacks that would then cause the berries to fall from those trees as part of the attack yeah and then you can pick them up after the end of the battle yeah it was a very cool mechanic i like that one because it made those environments feel more alive well the berry farming reached its pinnacle in x and y absolutely yeah i would want that to come back but not but in like a way farming yeah i i don't think that the sh i like that they tried something new but i don't know whose thought process it was to be like let's just make trainers shake trees and then most of the time squivet will come down and it will be annoying kids like shaking trees i would yeah i would want the i would want the farming stuff to come back in x and y but in in like a way where it felt like you were upgrading it in more of like a harvest moon way of like getting better watering cans or being able like the fertilizer stuff didn't really do anything yeah it did it was kind of more likely that your berries would hybridize one fertilizer took care of everything there was like 18 fertilizers but it really didn't matter which one you used well that is not true that is not true oh my gosh you just because you didn't pay attention doesn't mean that people didn't know how to use them properly oh i fertilized you better believe i fertilized nobody grew as many berries as will anderson i mean well if you're gonna go up against will the berry master anderson yeah then you had better have all of your ducks and your a fertilizer i mean not only did he master x and y but he completely killed all the berries in sun and moon what have you done i maxed out my berries in sun and moon for the record i didn't i i did like that they brought back radar in x and y but they also changed it it wasn't the same so i don't completely mind if they bring back stuff but it would be nice if it was more modernized or they changed it in a way improved improved yeah just not breathing because it's a new system and a new thing but they could keep an idea you know what they really need to bring back seasons yes please please please please you have weather and it doesn't it should affect the sauce book but there's no sauce book literally a game on the ds not even the 3ds the ds had weather day and night and seasons and that's been too hard to replicate on subsequent systems i mean didn't they remove day and night from hoenn gen 3 didn't have day and night did it did gen 3 didn't have day night because johto uh parents of kids playing jojo were real mad and so they killed it well the problem with like seasons and day and night and all that stuff is people just change their clock well not all people not all people kids didn't they stayed up too late and then their parents got mad and complained about gen 2 and so we didn't have it anymore in gen 3. people were impatient enough to wait two days for the sandstorm to change to get whatever i don't know whatever appeared in the wild area uh when it was only sandstorming umbria umbrella yeah yes i mean at least that's one of them yeah i don't know why but that was one of them will question of the week or every every week pokemon real hard time last week's pokemon of the week it was very short sweet simple this region exclusive bird-looking pokemon has an eighth note for a head and a metronome for a tale it was banned in global battle union because some people think it's fun to be rude who's that pokemon it's cramer ant oh of course yes well at least you got it's a bird you know grandma is a bird chat it is chat hot it's just how much you've been guessing for the past two years give me that trivia okay one shuffle icon amazing too shiny also amazing yeah chat shiny is pretty good prior to shiny chat i do i i was the first pokemon i radared in x and y successfully that's the key word successfully prior to gen 6 chat is the only pokemon whose cry was not altered when it faints or is sent out with a status condition despite having a significantly special higher special attack and speed chat's evs award attack points um in generation four the person in eterna city will trade a chat out in return for a weasel the chat's name is charap which is a mixture of the english and japanese name if this pokemon was obtained in an english version of diamond or x or diamond of pearl and traded to x and y the game will recognize chat to be japanese that's actually really cool uh chad is the only pokemon that is not legendary or mythical to be banned from generation five's global battle union this is likely due to chat's signature move of chatter alright are you ready for the new yes always ready for new everyone will know how greg ruined this by the time i get to the end i ruined nothing you don't know that yet greg and i met up today july 19 2020 to play pokemon go in a local park and we had a terrible time the weather was frightful both too sunny and too windy all of the other people in the park were horrible not making room on the path for us i felt very grim about our ability to enjoy the day i then had an awful realization a dire consequence of my wearing a tank top would be sunburn it was a frightening thought equally terrifying i was wearing flip-flops and we had planned to walk several miles i would soon develop horrifying blisters equally alarming greg wasn't doing too well either he had a distressing limp to his walk it was simply shocking how poorly this day had turned out pokemon go events have an appalling way of turning bad after a harrowing ride home i am finally safe i'm not reading that again that's all you can if you couldn't get it from that folks come on [Laughter] somebody's literally going to message me and they'll be like i have no idea that's our show if you have not uh if you forgot podcastawards.com uh anniversary project on july 31st what else is there go fest this weekend i will attempt to live stream it i want to commit my weekend to go fest but i also want to stream it but i don't want to sit in my office and do it so thinking of options somebody actually suggested going downtown milwaukee and renting a hotel room so i'm surrounded by pokestops and i could also stream it which actually it's not a bad idea it's not bad it's yeah and hotels actually aren't too expensive no not right now yeah air conditioning i'd be able to stream it or you can come stay at the hotel i'm gonna be at and then there are no pokestops down there are you sure i think so oh i'd have to look at that the one it's the one right the one that i'm always at oh if it's the one in brookfield then no that one has zero poke that one has one pokestop in the building but i i would want a place that would be this this is the hotel requirement would be at least one gym in reach and probably two pokestops in reach that would probably have to be the requirement hotel.com they are desperate i'm sure i'm sure they are i wonder if they list like pokestops and gyms check their linkedin [Music] you can always call the hotel and ask how many pokestops and gyms are reachable from your roof yeah fine find somebody who plays can i get a street view room window please close this to this specific gym all right we'll be back next week you can follow us on twitter at white wing for greg at washington for will at dragging a like for me at pkmncast on twitter instagram youtube
