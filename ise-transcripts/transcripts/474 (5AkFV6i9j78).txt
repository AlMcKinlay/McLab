my pokeball plus while we were recording (0:41 - 0:45)
alas (0:44 - 0:48)
my pokeball plus is out of battery (0:45 - 0:51)
yeah i thought about too i was cuz i had (0:48 - 0:52)
it i'm like i got it here i got right (0:51 - 0:55)
here i'm gonna connect it and it's like (0:52 - 0:57)
no i don't light up anymore because you (0:55 - 0:59)
have to charge me so it's charging in (0:57 - 1:01)
the bathroom (0:59 - 1:02)
oh (1:01 - 1:04)
okay uh will's there (1:02 - 1:07)
well is got his pokeball plus going (1:04 - 1:09)
catching shinies (1:07 - 1:10)
as we go zip tie (1:09 - 1:13)
well that's how you like pokeball plus (1:10 - 1:14)
yes (1:13 - 1:16)
oh gosh sounds like tick tock everything (1:14 - 1:20)
on ticket talks a life hack life hacks (1:16 - 1:21)
you put the (1:20 - 1:22)
roll of toilet paper on the thing that's (1:21 - 1:25)
not a life hack that's how you do it why (1:22 - 1:27)
was the lady (1:25 - 1:29)
submerging after she put her foundation (1:27 - 1:31)
on she submerged her face in cold water (1:29 - 1:33)
and she's like look my makeup looks (1:31 - 1:35)
absolutely perfect 16 hours later and (1:33 - 1:37)
i'm like why would you want your makeup (1:35 - 1:41)
stop wearing makeup how about that (1:37 - 1:41)
did i ever tell you about the time that (1:41 - 1:45)
i saw this video that said you're tying (1:43 - 1:47)
your shoes wrong (1:45 - 1:49)
and so i went to it thinking (1:47 - 1:51)
oh i'm tying my shoes wrong except (1:49 - 1:53)
though they only showed the right way (1:51 - 1:55)
which is the way i tie my shoes and (1:53 - 1:57)
since then i have been confused that (1:55 - 1:59)
there is another way to tie shoes out (1:57 - 2:02)
there that i've never run into (1:59 - 2:05)
what do you make the two loops and then (2:02 - 2:07)
wrap the loops around each other (2:05 - 2:10)
no how do you do it do you do bunny ears (2:07 - 2:11)
yeah (2:10 - 2:13)
that's what i'm saying you make two (2:11 - 2:14)
loops and then wrap the loops around (2:13 - 2:16)
each other if that's bunny ears (2:14 - 2:18)
because i like to try to make the faster (2:16 - 2:19)
way yeah (2:18 - 2:21)
look i have to show you i'll have to (2:19 - 2:23)
show you something anyways it's hard to (2:21 - 2:25)
explain when i watched this video the (2:23 - 2:27)
video showed me the way that i tie my (2:25 - 2:30)
shoes which means there is another way (2:27 - 2:33)
out there that i have never run into and (2:30 - 2:34)
i know nobody who ties their shoes i (2:33 - 2:36)
know that there are two ways to tie your (2:34 - 2:39)
shoes one is the over under and then (2:36 - 2:42)
like kind of wrap it around your finger (2:39 - 2:43)
that way (2:42 - 2:45)
and then there's another way where you (2:43 - 2:47)
you make two loops and then you wrap the (2:45 - 2:48)
loops around each other and around each (2:47 - 2:50)
other and you're done and that's (2:48 - 2:52)
supposed to be there's a third way (2:50 - 2:54)
faster than that there are too many you (2:52 - 2:56)
know the fastest way is like what you (2:54 - 2:59)
millennials gen zers or whatever are (2:56 - 3:00)
doing where you don't ever untie your (2:59 - 3:05)
shoes and you just leave them loose (3:00 - 3:05)
velcro okay get the shoehorn (3:11 - 3:16)
shoehorn (3:14 - 3:17)
yeah then you don't have to worry about (3:16 - 3:21)
the heel being flat when you put your (3:17 - 3:21)
sometimes i feel like it this is the (3:22 - 3:26)
premium ise content we'll record videos (3:24 - 3:28)
of the three of us tying shoes (3:26 - 3:30)
hide behind a paywall it'll be great (3:28 - 3:33)
yeah everybody's in for shoe ties (3:30 - 3:35)
uh (3:33 - 3:36)
let's talk about the pokemon news (3:35 - 3:38)
is this (3:36 - 3:40)
they're (3:38 - 3:42)
always (3:40 - 3:45)
never not pokemon news and so we haven't (3:42 - 3:46)
yet pulled the article that you're (3:45 - 3:48)
saving in your back pocket from (3:46 - 3:51)
1999. we don't need the backup articles (3:48 - 3:52)
yet (3:51 - 3:53)
we're going to start off with a tweet (3:52 - 3:56)
though it says attention trainers tune (3:53 - 3:58)
into our youtube channel on wednesday (3:56 - 4:03)
august 18th 2021 at 6 00 am p d t (3:58 - 4:06)
that's 8 am central time for people who (4:03 - 4:08)
live in the good area of the united (4:06 - 4:11)
states uh for a pokemon presents video (4:08 - 4:12)
presenting (4:11 - 4:15)
uh pokemon diamond brilliant diamond and (4:12 - 4:18)
there's a lot of the hashtag (4:15 - 4:20)
pokemon brilliant diet diamond pokemon (4:18 - 4:25)
shining pearl and pokemon legends arceus (4:20 - 4:28)
uh and it's supposed to be 23 minutes (4:25 - 4:30)
long which is the last 28 minutes long i (4:28 - 4:32)
thought it was 23. i have no clue i (4:30 - 4:35)
think it's 23. uh i could be wrong (4:32 - 4:37)
though it's 20 something it's (4:35 - 4:39)
regardless it's the longest (4:37 - 4:41)
pokemon presents not technically a (4:39 - 4:43)
pokemon direct i don't think they use (4:41 - 4:44)
the word pokemon direct anymore but i (4:43 - 4:48)
also don't think it matters (4:44 - 4:48)
uh (4:48 - 4:52)
so yeah they finally are gonna give us (4:50 - 4:54)
something to (4:52 - 4:55)
talk about (4:54 - 4:56)
finally (4:55 - 4:59)
well wait that's being presumptuous they (4:56 - 5:00)
may give us information they may give us (4:59 - 5:02)
that worth talking about (5:00 - 5:05)
they may give us absolutely nothing uh (5:02 - 5:10)
greg's right it's 28 minutes so ha ha (5:05 - 5:10)
so on june 17th (5:10 - 5:15)
2020 which is what was that the day (5:12 - 5:18)
before the day no that was the day of (5:15 - 5:21)
isle of armor (5:18 - 5:22)
that was the (5:21 - 5:25)
10 minute and 50 second presentation (5:22 - 5:27)
which i believe showed (5:25 - 5:31)
isle of armor and i think pokemon smile (5:27 - 5:33)
yes (5:31 - 5:35)
and i feel like there was one more thing (5:33 - 5:37)
and then the following week because they (5:35 - 5:38)
were like come back for (5:37 - 5:41)
new information for a new thing (5:38 - 5:42)
and everyone thought it was let's go (5:41 - 5:45)
johto because there was (5:42 - 5:47)
espeon plush behind the dude i don't (5:45 - 5:49)
know it was a bit of a stretch there's a (5:47 - 5:51)
there's an old nine tails plush behind (5:49 - 5:52)
me so that should be your first clue (5:51 - 5:55)
that something special is happening (5:52 - 5:58)
the old sun and moon remakes coming yeah (5:55 - 5:59)
and awesome (5:58 - 6:01)
special thing up here (5:59 - 6:02)
and (6:01 - 6:05)
uh knock off ducklit (6:02 - 6:07)
so june 24th which was the following (6:05 - 6:10)
week was 11 minutes long uh that was the (6:07 - 6:14)
first time we saw a pokemon unite (6:10 - 6:14)
and then february 26 which is earlier (6:14 - 6:20)
this year of course that was a 20 minute (6:18 - 6:23)
and 26 second presentation and that was (6:20 - 6:24)
the (6:23 - 6:25)
music (6:24 - 6:29)
announcement right and the (6:25 - 6:29)
trailers originally and then the (6:31 - 6:37)
remember our history kind of thing and (6:35 - 6:39)
i don't know how they wasted 20 minutes (6:37 - 6:40)
but they did (6:39 - 6:42)
i mean 20 minutes goes fast when you (6:40 - 6:44)
have nothing to talk about as proven (6:42 - 6:46)
it's very true you look at the show the (6:44 - 6:51)
show is proof how fast time flies (6:46 - 6:52)
um but yeah prior to that they were (6:51 - 6:54)
saying pokemon direct pokemon direct (6:52 - 6:56)
pokemon direct and then i guess june (6:54 - 6:58)
17th they call it pokemon presents and (6:56 - 6:59)
they've been using that since so (6:58 - 7:01)
they just don't want crossover brand (6:59 - 7:03)
confusion with nintendo directs yeah (7:01 - 7:05)
that's probably (7:03 - 7:08)
the alliteration really the pokemon (7:05 - 7:11)
presents pokemon presents pokemon (7:08 - 7:13)
pokemon (7:11 - 7:15)
so that's exciting uh i don't i mean we (7:13 - 7:17)
could sit here and speculate and waste (7:15 - 7:19)
time but literally there has been (7:17 - 7:22)
nothing shown been nothing so it's gonna (7:19 - 7:23)
show us something (7:22 - 7:26)
nothing we could say today would be any (7:23 - 7:27)
different than what we've been saying so (7:26 - 7:29)
we'll just (7:27 - 7:33)
expect a long episode next week or (7:29 - 7:34)
not i mean it depends on how much they (7:33 - 7:37)
waste in these 28 minutes uh well i'm (7:34 - 7:39)
sure they'll show the games finally and (7:37 - 7:41)
two 10-minute trailers and eight minutes (7:39 - 7:42)
of (7:41 - 7:44)
interstitial chatting (7:42 - 7:46)
the one thing i will say is i'm very (7:44 - 7:47)
curious (7:46 - 7:51)
if they will use the words open world (7:47 - 7:53)
for arceus because they have not used (7:51 - 7:55)
those words at all ooh make a bingo card (7:53 - 7:57)
and put it on (7:55 - 7:59)
instagram yeah (7:57 - 8:02)
because even though i (7:59 - 8:04)
and probably obviously the rest of the (8:02 - 8:05)
world (8:04 - 8:06)
can look at that game and go oh that (8:05 - 8:08)
looks open world (8:06 - 8:11)
they did not ever say that in any press (8:08 - 8:13)
release or any (8:11 - 8:17)
uh information dump or any (8:13 - 8:19)
linkedin post (8:17 - 8:21)
linkedin post do you think they're (8:19 - 8:23)
hiding details on linkedin is that the (8:21 - 8:25)
secret to the 25th anniversary it's all (8:23 - 8:28)
been on linkedin they actually called me (8:25 - 8:29)
up and they're like will how do you make (8:28 - 8:32)
your pokemons of the weeks (8:29 - 8:35)
so like intriguing and and (8:32 - 8:37)
and deep and like so mysterious and i (8:35 - 8:38)
was like well you can sometimes you (8:37 - 8:40)
gotta sprinkle it where people don't (8:38 - 8:42)
expect it right linkedin try one on (8:40 - 8:44)
linkedin and see what you get (8:42 - 8:46)
go back go back to live journal there's (8:44 - 8:49)
a whole thing on live journal i'm sure (8:46 - 8:51)
you know i'm sure there is (8:49 - 8:53)
uh you know we haven't (8:51 - 8:55)
talked about community day on the show (8:53 - 8:56)
in (8:55 - 8:58)
probably over a year because comedian (8:56 - 9:00)
day is (8:58 - 9:01)
the same (9:00 - 9:03)
yep (9:01 - 9:03)
but (9:04 - 9:07)
my community was interesting i'd be (9:05 - 9:08)
curious if your guys's day was (9:07 - 9:11)
interesting and the reason that we're (9:08 - 9:13)
going to spend the next couple minutes (9:11 - 9:15)
here talking about community is because (9:13 - 9:17)
one it was a repeat (9:15 - 9:20)
and two this was the first community day (9:17 - 9:21)
where (9:20 - 9:23)
uh well i shouldn't say the first (9:21 - 9:25)
community where there's been pokemon go (9:23 - 9:28)
drama but (9:25 - 9:28)
we talked about it last week people were (9:29 - 9:34)
very upset about the distance (9:30 - 9:35)
uh (9:34 - 9:38)
and boy did i feel it on community day (9:35 - 9:41)
yeah i feel like (9:38 - 9:44)
it wasn't that big of a deal (9:41 - 9:46)
going out and playing for like 10 (9:44 - 9:48)
minutes the day they changed it but when (9:46 - 9:50)
you're outside for like five six hours (9:48 - 9:52)
you're like man this (9:50 - 9:53)
this is terrible (9:52 - 9:56)
this is this is not fun (9:53 - 9:58)
it reminds me of only only destiny (9:56 - 10:00)
players will know this it reminds me of (9:58 - 10:04)
like i was a huge i put 1 200 hours into (10:00 - 10:07)
like the hunter class in destiny (10:04 - 10:08)
well well maybe knows what i'm talking (10:07 - 10:10)
about and then in destiny 2 they changed (10:08 - 10:13)
just a couple things about it (10:10 - 10:15)
and i hated it (10:13 - 10:16)
and it was just like (10:15 - 10:18)
two or three very minor changes and i (10:16 - 10:21)
was like these are all awful yeah i (10:18 - 10:22)
don't know (10:21 - 10:25)
anymore they did that to classes in mmos (10:22 - 10:27)
a lot where they're like we're doing (10:25 - 10:29)
this and then you play you're like no i (10:27 - 10:32)
don't this is bad i don't like this um (10:29 - 10:36)
but the thing that like shocked me is (10:32 - 10:39)
for a community (10:36 - 10:39)
is i went to uh elm grove village park (10:39 - 10:45)
one of the best places to play in in (10:42 - 10:47)
milwaukee (10:45 - 10:48)
and (10:47 - 10:51)
i have gone there probably (10:48 - 10:53)
20 plus times (10:51 - 10:54)
how many communities have there been (10:53 - 10:55)
like (10:54 - 10:58)
40 at this point (10:55 - 11:01)
well it's per month so (10:58 - 11:02)
there's something (11:01 - 11:06)
but it started late four years (11:02 - 11:07)
one per month (11:06 - 11:08)
12 yeah like (11:07 - 11:11)
four or three years uh well okay we'll (11:08 - 11:14)
say between 36 and 48 sure yeah (11:11 - 11:16)
somewhere in there (11:14 - 11:19)
um (11:16 - 11:19)
and i arrived at noon i was an hour late (11:19 - 11:25)
same (11:23 - 11:28)
i parked it was a gorgeous day out it (11:25 - 11:29)
was about 75. (11:28 - 11:32)
it was really nice (11:29 - 11:32)
park wasn't didn't look too busy i (11:32 - 11:35)
parked (11:34 - 11:38)
i got out of the car loaded up go (11:35 - 11:40)
evolve my mega pidgeot (11:38 - 11:44)
to get that normal boost (11:40 - 11:47)
oh why didn't you give me that sick tip (11:44 - 11:49)
i should i don't think i have one (11:47 - 11:52)
i mean i have one i didn't do it (11:49 - 11:54)
and there are probably 30 to 40 (11:52 - 11:57)
pokestops at this park (11:54 - 12:00)
and only two of them were lured up (11:57 - 12:03)
and we're an hour into the event (12:00 - 12:04)
now i know what you're saying steve it (12:03 - 12:07)
was a repeat community (12:04 - 12:07)
we've had repeat communities before but (12:08 - 12:12)
the thing that i was always stuck stood (12:10 - 12:13)
out in my mind (12:12 - 12:16)
i can't remember which community it was (12:13 - 12:16)
but (12:16 - 12:18)
i went to it was it was in the middle of (12:16 - 12:23)
winter it was like 28 degrees fahrenheit (12:18 - 12:27)
snow everywhere the walkways were icy (12:23 - 12:28)
there were (12:27 - 12:31)
people out there with shorts cheese hats (12:28 - 12:33)
whatever else people do in wisconsin (12:31 - 12:35)
every stop was lured up (12:33 - 12:39)
like wisconsin people the the cold is (12:35 - 12:41)
not going to stop yeah the cold doesn't (12:39 - 12:43)
stop much if it's a good community the (12:41 - 12:45)
snow (12:43 - 12:47)
it could be raining all these stuff it (12:45 - 12:48)
was (12:47 - 12:49)
the first time ever i was like (12:48 - 12:53)
oh no one's doing this community (12:49 - 12:54)
now ever since they've done six hour (12:53 - 12:57)
commute days i've seen it where (12:54 - 12:58)
you know the first three hours are (12:57 - 13:00)
pretty bustling the last three hours or (12:58 - 13:02)
not which is understandable you can only (13:00 - 13:04)
do so much and (13:02 - 13:06)
it's the same thing for six hours i get (13:04 - 13:08)
it you know you get your three shinies (13:06 - 13:10)
you baby play for two three maybe four (13:08 - 13:13)
hours you go home you get a sandwich (13:10 - 13:16)
but no one was playing so i'm curious it (13:13 - 13:18)
was it it felt weird but also like oh (13:16 - 13:22)
maybe the people are putting their money (13:18 - 13:23)
where their mouth is (13:22 - 13:25)
and they're like i don't want to (13:23 - 13:28)
buy lures i don't want to buy (13:25 - 13:31)
incubators i don't want to buy lure (13:28 - 13:33)
incense (13:31 - 13:35)
i'm not going to play the game because (13:33 - 13:37)
i'm mad about this change or maybe i (13:35 - 13:38)
don't know wisconsin just doesn't like (13:37 - 13:40)
evie uh but i don't know how you're as a (13:38 - 13:43)
comedian it was uh you went to the art (13:40 - 13:44)
party yeah we went to we went to the air (13:43 - 13:47)
park like we always do uh it was quieter (13:44 - 13:50)
than normal yes agreed uh there were (13:47 - 13:51)
because (13:50 - 13:53)
normally like you were there for you (13:51 - 13:55)
were there for a go fest so that's when (13:53 - 13:57)
it was his busiest and usually it's (13:55 - 13:59)
about half that many people in a regular (13:57 - 14:01)
community today and i would say there (13:59 - 14:02)
was (14:01 - 14:05)
maybe a fourth of that when we were (14:02 - 14:07)
there yesterday like (14:05 - 14:10)
our group of six (14:07 - 14:10)
was the biggest group i saw other than a (14:11 - 14:15)
family that had way too many kids (14:13 - 14:17)
yeah uh but usually right now some of (14:15 - 14:20)
those kids look adopted so yeah well (14:17 - 14:21)
who knows they still had way too many (14:20 - 14:24)
kids they're like 400 kids (14:21 - 14:27)
and usually (14:24 - 14:27)
every other stop i would say is has some (14:27 - 14:32)
sort of lure on it (14:30 - 14:35)
and there were only three (14:32 - 14:37)
up near this community center and one (14:35 - 14:38)
down at the bottom of the path and the (14:37 - 14:40)
rest was empty other than the few that i (14:38 - 14:41)
put up (14:40 - 14:44)
we didn't run into anybody who was (14:41 - 14:46)
really playing like we'd usually walk (14:44 - 14:47)
past people who were on their phone (14:46 - 14:50)
playing and that really didn't happen it (14:47 - 14:53)
was a very quiet day um (14:50 - 14:57)
so i i would say that attendance was (14:53 - 15:00)
down because we got there at noon (14:57 - 15:03)
but i i would just also say overall the (15:00 - 15:05)
park was emptier than usual yeah the (15:03 - 15:07)
park was really like over by the (15:05 - 15:09)
i want to call it the flaming canoe but (15:07 - 15:11)
that doesn't sound right (15:09 - 15:15)
i mean it's a canoe fire pit so (15:11 - 15:16)
normally like there's families having (15:15 - 15:18)
picnics there and there was nobody there (15:16 - 15:21)
was nobody there but also (15:18 - 15:22)
they were setting up for a wedding and i (15:21 - 15:24)
wonder because you could see that when (15:22 - 15:26)
you were driving in i wonder if people (15:24 - 15:26)
saw (15:26 - 15:28)
the setup for the wedding and was like (15:26 - 15:29)
and we're like oh i don't want to be (15:28 - 15:31)
around here (15:29 - 15:33)
when the wedding's happening so left but (15:31 - 15:34)
i've been there when they've been (15:33 - 15:36)
sending it for weddings before and that (15:34 - 15:38)
hasn't happened it could have driven (15:36 - 15:39)
some people away but (15:38 - 15:41)
i mean it was on a saturday which is (15:39 - 15:45)
usually more busy than sunday yeah (15:41 - 15:47)
so the other thing i might say is there (15:45 - 15:49)
there weren't any good raids (15:47 - 15:51)
no it's like one of the draws of coming (15:49 - 15:55)
out to a community (15:51 - 15:55)
[Laughter] (15:57 - 16:01)
no no i mean when we did a raid it was a (16:02 - 16:07)
shellows and i had just hatched one in (16:05 - 16:08)
the morning and i was like why am i (16:07 - 16:11)
wasting my raid pass on this slimy slug (16:08 - 16:13)
because we got it right back afterwards (16:11 - 16:17)
we had to complete a raid for a quest (16:13 - 16:17)
also greg didn't buy the community day (16:18 - 16:24)
special research i don't know why 99 (16:21 - 16:27)
cents shouting that out calling him out (16:24 - 16:30)
on that okay both of you and alex were (16:27 - 16:32)
like i'll give you the 99 cents and i'm (16:30 - 16:34)
like i just don't want to deal with the (16:32 - 16:36)
special research today i don't want to (16:34 - 16:40)
do it i don't care i don't want more evs (16:36 - 16:42)
i'm a happy way i am is that a money (16:40 - 16:44)
thing i have the money i just didn't (16:42 - 16:46)
want to do it and that's also a big (16:44 - 16:47)
criteria too because like i was looking (16:46 - 16:49)
at it i was like the last time we had (16:47 - 16:52)
the two-day eb day i got like 17 shiny (16:49 - 16:56)
eevees how many more shiny evs do i need (16:52 - 16:56)
but (16:57 - 17:01)
what everybody who didn't show up did (16:59 - 17:02)
miss (17:01 - 17:05)
were some really good hamburgers oh yeah (17:02 - 17:07)
good hamburger yeah we did i like that (17:05 - 17:10)
place it's very yummy we had a very good (17:07 - 17:11)
lunch (17:10 - 17:13)
i (17:11 - 17:15)
full disclosure niantic did pay for my (17:13 - 17:19)
99 ticket so give that to me (17:15 - 17:23)
i do i you you i i used it i did it (17:19 - 17:25)
you're more likely to pay money yeah (17:23 - 17:27)
research work blah blah (17:25 - 17:29)
uh you know i don't i would do it for (17:27 - 17:30)
free (17:29 - 17:33)
if somebody forced it if somebody forced (17:30 - 17:34)
it upon me and said oh we bought you (17:33 - 17:36)
this ticket and here it is (17:34 - 17:39)
i would do it but i was gonna make a (17:36 - 17:42)
point of it (17:39 - 17:42)
i don't know if i would have bought it (17:42 - 17:47)
i kind of forgot (17:45 - 17:49)
and then (17:47 - 17:51)
like i was like oh (17:49 - 17:53)
i have this ticket in my inventory (17:51 - 17:54)
thanks niantic (17:53 - 17:57)
um (17:54 - 17:59)
i didn't expect to play as long as i (17:57 - 18:01)
played i ended up playing for four hours (17:59 - 18:02)
which is (18:01 - 18:04)
way too long for a repeat community but (18:02 - 18:05)
i was (18:04 - 18:08)
my community is when it (18:05 - 18:10)
because i i don't play with anyone here (18:08 - 18:13)
in wisconsin is pretty much calling my (18:10 - 18:15)
dad or somebody else and then like being (18:13 - 18:17)
on the phone (18:15 - 18:19)
and then not paying attention to the (18:17 - 18:21)
game and then just like walking and (18:19 - 18:24)
talking i like to walk and talk (18:21 - 18:26)
or listen to like an audiobook i got (18:24 - 18:28)
some audiobook done so (18:26 - 18:30)
when i when i ended community and i was (18:28 - 18:33)
like wow cool i walked like (18:30 - 18:35)
10 miles oh and i caught like 20 shinies (18:33 - 18:38)
like why what am i gonna do with this (18:35 - 18:40)
but the weather was super nice like it (18:38 - 18:42)
was it was a gorgeous day that's why i (18:40 - 18:44)
was so shocked that the park was like (18:42 - 18:45)
empty (18:44 - 18:47)
but again i mean if this has to do with (18:45 - 18:49)
people (18:47 - 18:51)
i look i'm guilty of it i love this game (18:49 - 18:53)
it's very hard for me to stop playing i (18:51 - 18:54)
get it people are mad people don't want (18:53 - 18:55)
to play people don't want to give money (18:54 - 18:58)
i totally understand i'm on your side i (18:55 - 19:02)
have a problem i like this video game uh (18:58 - 19:05)
and so for me like walking 10 miles was (19:02 - 19:07)
like it felt good physically and (19:05 - 19:09)
mentally to you know get out there i i (19:07 - 19:12)
will say of some value to both greg and (19:09 - 19:15)
i are that we both (19:12 - 19:17)
me sooner than greg (19:15 - 19:18)
uh (19:17 - 19:20)
got the research tasks to get to level (19:18 - 19:21)
42 (19:20 - 19:24)
which means you have to evolve every (19:21 - 19:28)
form of eevee again yes folks again (19:24 - 19:32)
again it doesn't count whatever (19:28 - 19:36)
the uh sylveon bonus made that much much (19:32 - 19:37)
easier because starting the day on (19:36 - 19:39)
saturday i had (19:37 - 19:40)
uh (19:39 - 19:44)
i think it was like i had (19:40 - 19:46)
uh leafeon (19:44 - 19:49)
umbreon and sylveon left (19:46 - 19:51)
that i had to do this evolve the second (19:49 - 19:56)
time and so since i was able to use the (19:51 - 19:58)
it takes less time to evolve into a (19:56 - 20:00)
sylveon i could get that done quickly (19:58 - 20:02)
and then i did umbreon that night and (20:00 - 20:05)
now i'm level 42. did you need nice did (20:02 - 20:07)
they add sylvia to the 42 (20:05 - 20:10)
i said all eight evolutions (20:07 - 20:12)
because when i did 42 sylveon wasn't (20:10 - 20:13)
even the game yet (20:12 - 20:14)
well then i mean (20:13 - 20:16)
counts because it counts it counted for (20:14 - 20:20)
me because i just did it today (20:16 - 20:20)
okay (20:21 - 20:24)
um i will say i was in the game when i (20:22 - 20:26)
was 42 so obviously that was skipped (20:24 - 20:27)
yeah we (20:26 - 20:29)
i mean we didn't play for very long uh (20:27 - 20:31)
we were there for an hour and a half and (20:29 - 20:34)
then we were all like we're hungry and i (20:31 - 20:36)
have 13 chinese let's go (20:34 - 20:38)
we walked three miles and then it was (20:36 - 20:40)
like burger time yep and we went and got (20:38 - 20:42)
burgers i mean there's only so long we (20:40 - 20:45)
can talk about trashing steve yeah you (20:42 - 20:48)
know as a group well not sitting down (20:45 - 20:50)
sitting down exactly we brought up all (20:48 - 20:52)
of the energy to continue the (20:50 - 20:55)
conversation (20:52 - 20:55)
[Laughter] (20:57 - 21:02)
[Music] (20:59 - 21:02)
uh this was sent in by casey f in our (21:06 - 21:10)
slack community uh (21:08 - 21:13)
several johto pokemon are added to the (21:10 - 21:15)
chinese version of pokemon quest (21:13 - 21:18)
starting next month (21:15 - 21:22)
i don't know why this is (21:18 - 21:22)
i i know why this is going around i (21:22 - 21:25)
shouldn't say i don't know why this is (21:24 - 21:26)
going around (21:25 - 21:29)
but i think (21:26 - 21:29)
it's it's not surprising to me because (21:29 - 21:34)
i've been following pokemon quests in (21:32 - 21:35)
china and they've added a lot of things (21:34 - 21:38)
there's like pvp in that game and (21:35 - 21:39)
there's some other stuff (21:38 - 21:42)
so the johto pokemon being added isn't (21:39 - 21:44)
shocking (21:42 - 21:45)
but (21:44 - 21:48)
to shock our audience that are like oh (21:45 - 21:49)
joe (21:48 - 21:51)
the game in china isn't even developed (21:49 - 21:54)
by game freaks (21:51 - 21:54)
i don't know the exact deal and i don't (21:54 - 22:01)
know if anyone knows the exact deal (21:56 - 22:03)
uh i went to the wikipedia page here and (22:01 - 22:06)
just says developer game freak i don't (22:03 - 22:10)
know who the chinese developer is (22:06 - 22:12)
but there was (22:10 - 22:15)
a deal between the pokemon company and a (22:12 - 22:17)
developer in china (22:15 - 22:19)
to (22:17 - 22:22)
make pokemon quest a thing there (22:19 - 22:24)
and to reach that audience which is very (22:22 - 22:25)
big (22:24 - 22:27)
and there (22:25 - 22:30)
there has been a ton of updates like i (22:27 - 22:34)
said pvp some other stuff um added like (22:30 - 22:35)
some downloadable content that has been (22:34 - 22:37)
exclusive to china for (22:35 - 22:39)
however long the game has been out (22:37 - 22:42)
so that came out like right before let's (22:39 - 22:43)
go pikachu let's go eevee but i think (22:42 - 22:46)
the chinese version started like six (22:43 - 22:49)
months after that (22:46 - 22:49)
uh i don't know too long didn't read the (22:50 - 22:53)
stuff is probably never coming to (22:52 - 22:56)
america because obviously (22:53 - 22:59)
nothing prior to it has come and i don't (22:56 - 23:01)
think this developer is making this (22:59 - 23:02)
developer's not making a worldwide game (23:01 - 23:04)
they're making a game specifically for (23:02 - 23:06)
china to fit their audience and (23:04 - 23:08)
there's a bunch of games (23:06 - 23:10)
outside of pokemon that have been always (23:08 - 23:11)
exclusive to china i think there's like (23:10 - 23:13)
a exclusive call of duty (23:11 - 23:14)
mobile (23:13 - 23:18)
game that's china only (23:14 - 23:20)
and there's (23:18 - 23:22)
probably i can think of two mobas off (23:20 - 23:24)
the top of my head that are exclusive to (23:22 - 23:26)
china but i am sure there are way more (23:24 - 23:28)
than that yeah there's a lot more i'm (23:26 - 23:31)
sure (23:28 - 23:31)
so it's it's cool i had (23:31 - 23:37)
i don't know i (23:35 - 23:40)
feel like it would've been the same (23:37 - 23:42)
point i made for (23:40 - 23:44)
pokemon snap is you know all these (23:42 - 23:46)
people asked for dlc (23:44 - 23:48)
the dlc came where were these people (23:46 - 23:51)
when it arrived greg didn't even play it (23:48 - 23:53)
okay (23:51 - 23:55)
once people get a thing they generally (23:53 - 23:57)
don't go on (23:55 - 24:00)
uh social media to say hey i got this (23:57 - 24:02)
thing they generally just go and play it (24:00 - 24:05)
i was very (24:02 - 24:05)
at the top of the world anytime (24:06 - 24:10)
waluigi is added to the game yeah when (24:08 - 24:12)
it's added do you hear it when why luigi (24:10 - 24:14)
hits the actual game do you see a bunch (24:12 - 24:16)
of people posting all the things about (24:14 - 24:19)
waluigi no they're satisfied and they go (24:16 - 24:20)
sit in the room and play the game maybe (24:19 - 24:22)
i follow too many smash people you (24:20 - 24:24)
follow too many special others i also (24:22 - 24:26)
told you up front that i was just going (24:24 - 24:29)
to watch you play the game and not play (24:26 - 24:31)
it because rosalia was not added (24:29 - 24:34)
that i was going to sit down and get as (24:31 - 24:36)
much enjoyment of watching you stress (24:34 - 24:38)
out about the things as me stressing out (24:36 - 24:40)
about the things so very much (24:38 - 24:43)
he's playing final fantasy 14 is what's (24:40 - 24:47)
happening well that is (24:43 - 24:47)
y'all the grind is killing me (24:47 - 24:51)
i don't know maybe on wednesday they say (24:53 - 24:57)
hey we're bringing (24:55 - 24:59)
we're bringing back quest (24:57 - 25:00)
we're bringing back quest (24:59 - 25:03)
we got we we're working on a brand new (25:00 - 25:05)
arceus game but hey we put five people (25:03 - 25:06)
on (25:05 - 25:09)
what you should probably find out is (25:06 - 25:11)
that they set a financial target for (25:09 - 25:13)
quest and it was like it has to make (25:11 - 25:16)
this much money for us to do expansions (25:13 - 25:18)
and it made that much money in china but (25:16 - 25:19)
it didn't make that much money anywhere (25:18 - 25:21)
else so you're like you know what china (25:19 - 25:23)
you win the sweepstakes everybody else (25:21 - 25:25)
everybody else go scratch (25:23 - 25:26)
too bad (25:25 - 25:30)
you lose because you snoozed (25:26 - 25:30)
yeah i mean also like (25:31 - 25:34)
making good stuff takes time (25:35 - 25:39)
they're making a diff they're making a (25:38 - 25:42)
they're making arceus i don't know uh (25:39 - 25:45)
i'm pretty sure control c control v (25:42 - 25:47)
takes note oh right right control c very (25:45 - 25:49)
very well command on the apple computer (25:47 - 25:51)
oh come on i don't know i forget it's (25:49 - 25:53)
apple they're probably using graphic (25:51 - 25:55)
designs on macs (25:53 - 25:58)
so somebody has to sit and make all (25:55 - 26:02)
these cubed johto pokemon (25:58 - 26:02)
look just pull it out of the minecraft (26:02 - 26:07)
servers that were illegally created (26:05 - 26:09)
that's all they had to do (26:07 - 26:10)
yank them out of there they're already (26:09 - 26:12)
cubed (26:10 - 26:14)
yeah just steal the fan-made cubes and (26:12 - 26:17)
then sue them for when they yell yeah it (26:14 - 26:21)
all makes sense it all works out (26:17 - 26:21)
you know i like pokemon quest a lot i (26:21 - 26:27)
don't know if (26:24 - 26:29)
i feel like i would say i would i would (26:27 - 26:32)
go back to pokemon quest (26:29 - 26:35)
when if it had dlc (26:32 - 26:38)
and and i'm just speaking for myself but (26:35 - 26:40)
the pokemon snap thing came out and i (26:38 - 26:42)
played it for four hours and i enjoyed (26:40 - 26:44)
it and i didn't finish it again i'm (26:42 - 26:47)
missing like (26:44 - 26:48)
six of the (26:47 - 26:51)
20 pokemon (26:48 - 26:51)
but i i (26:51 - 26:54)
there's i don't know if there's a word (26:53 - 26:57)
for it but (26:54 - 26:57)
i felt like that ship sailed like so (26:58 - 27:02)
much time passed it was very hard to get (27:00 - 27:05)
back into it (27:02 - 27:06)
that's how i feel with final fantasy (27:05 - 27:08)
right now that's why i'm like on the (27:06 - 27:10)
fence of (27:08 - 27:12)
re-subscribing (27:10 - 27:14)
and then and snap has a low barrier of (27:12 - 27:16)
entry final fantasy is like oh boy this (27:14 - 27:19)
is not this is the problem with with (27:16 - 27:21)
getting older there's there's two (27:19 - 27:22)
factors (27:21 - 27:24)
that as we get older impact our ability (27:22 - 27:27)
to play games number one when we were (27:24 - 27:30)
younger games were way too expensive (27:27 - 27:32)
and not coming out that frequently so (27:30 - 27:34)
when you got a game (27:32 - 27:36)
you played the heck out of it (27:34 - 27:38)
at top bottom left right all the way (27:36 - 27:41)
through now it's like we get a a good (27:38 - 27:42)
game (27:41 - 27:44)
every two to three weeks something (27:42 - 27:47)
that's really worth playing except those (27:44 - 27:48)
games also still kind of pricey except (27:47 - 27:51)
we now we have more money (27:48 - 27:53)
so we can throw that money away (27:51 - 27:56)
well i don't like it i'll spend 60 in (27:53 - 27:58)
overwatch play for five minutes realize (27:56 - 28:01)
i hate it never play it again sure sure (27:58 - 28:03)
well it is like a psychology thing right (28:01 - 28:07)
like unite does this with bot matches (28:03 - 28:09)
uh i don't even don't we (28:07 - 28:10)
we'll talk yeah we'll have a (28:09 - 28:13)
conversation here but there there is in (28:10 - 28:14)
i don't (28:13 - 28:15)
i don't know if people notice this right (28:14 - 28:17)
away but (28:15 - 28:19)
if you are in (28:17 - 28:22)
not great expert if you're an expert (28:19 - 28:23)
rank (28:22 - 28:25)
and you lose three times in a row (28:23 - 28:28)
you are guaranteed (28:25 - 28:31)
a bot match (28:28 - 28:33)
which means (28:31 - 28:36)
that if you go into a match you're gonna (28:33 - 28:37)
see (28:36 - 28:38)
what you normally see (28:37 - 28:41)
whether you're solo or with a group (28:38 - 28:43)
and then (28:41 - 28:43)
there's two ways to tell (28:44 - 28:48)
before the match starts when all ten (28:45 - 28:51)
pokemon are queued up if you tap (28:48 - 28:53)
on the opponents they'll have this (28:51 - 28:55)
blurry zoomed in face and they'll all (28:53 - 28:57)
have that face and it's impossible to (28:55 - 29:00)
recreate on your trainer card (28:57 - 29:02)
um and then once the match starts you'll (29:00 - 29:05)
probably just destroy them because (29:02 - 29:07)
they're bots well have you gotten have (29:05 - 29:09)
you gotten the thing where you are the (29:07 - 29:12)
only player and everything else yes spot (29:09 - 29:14)
because you don't destroy them at that (29:12 - 29:16)
point if you did not realize it was a (29:14 - 29:18)
bot match and pick something that could (29:16 - 29:20)
actually do really good scoring (29:18 - 29:24)
so in the choice picture so if you (29:20 - 29:26)
well i always tell like i should be in a (29:24 - 29:27)
bot match when i'm picking my pokemon (29:26 - 29:29)
i'll pick (29:27 - 29:31)
aldegast like i always do and then (29:29 - 29:33)
suddenly everybody picks picks theirs (29:31 - 29:35)
and then i'll go switch to gardevoir and (29:33 - 29:37)
then they'll all rearrange yeah like (29:35 - 29:40)
this is 100 an all bot match and i'm (29:37 - 29:42)
going gardevoir because i need something (29:40 - 29:44)
that can do a lot of damage and score so (29:42 - 29:47)
that i could at least win this game with (29:44 - 29:50)
a bunch of bots who are programmed to do (29:47 - 29:51)
the exact same thing so all they do is (29:50 - 29:53)
run away from each other (29:51 - 29:55)
and it's just me running around trying (29:53 - 29:58)
to take care of everything and then uh (29:55 - 30:00)
when the match is over you can good job (29:58 - 30:01)
your team but you can always good job (30:00 - 30:03)
the enemy team if you want and in a bot (30:01 - 30:06)
match you cannot good job bots now they (30:03 - 30:08)
like i said they do look like humans so (30:06 - 30:11)
my my assumption is they take two human (30:08 - 30:12)
teams (30:11 - 30:14)
and then they grab the names and then (30:12 - 30:16)
they split them off or they're fighting (30:14 - 30:17)
a bot version of you and you're fighting (30:16 - 30:20)
a bot version of them how dare they (30:17 - 30:22)
but i do not approve the use of my (30:20 - 30:25)
likeness for these robot wars (30:22 - 30:27)
but i think going back to like snap and (30:25 - 30:29)
quest and how i feel like it's been so (30:27 - 30:32)
long where they add dlc and it's just (30:29 - 30:34)
like you you like that ship has sailed (30:32 - 30:36)
like it's so hard to get back (30:34 - 30:38)
i'm sure for some people listening (30:36 - 30:40)
they'll be like oh i've (30:38 - 30:42)
eat up pokemon quest dlc like i'm sure (30:40 - 30:45)
you you will but but i there has i don't (30:42 - 30:49)
know what the psychology is but (30:45 - 30:49)
in unite it feels like (30:49 - 30:53)
and i don't know if other mobas do this (30:51 - 30:54)
but (30:53 - 30:57)
like oh if our player keeps losing (30:54 - 30:59)
they're going to walk away from the game (30:57 - 31:02)
unhappy and then they're less likely to (30:59 - 31:03)
come back (31:02 - 31:06)
versus if we serve them a match where (31:03 - 31:10)
they're almost guaranteed to win (31:06 - 31:10)
and they win (31:10 - 31:15)
they may continue playing (31:11 - 31:17)
or they end on a win (31:15 - 31:19)
whereas the next day they're going to (31:17 - 31:21)
come back and be like (31:19 - 31:23)
well i stomped that last team so maybe (31:21 - 31:25)
today will be a good day (31:23 - 31:28)
so it's the old white men can't jump (31:25 - 31:30)
that's what it is so easy to tell that (31:28 - 31:33)
it's a bot match (31:30 - 31:35)
i i (31:33 - 31:36)
i feel like once it's pointing out to (31:35 - 31:38)
you yes but i'm i have to like point (31:36 - 31:40)
this out to people every single day and (31:38 - 31:42)
it's funny because you never would have (31:40 - 31:43)
realized (31:42 - 31:45)
that much attention week of the game i (31:43 - 31:48)
remember people posting on twitter these (31:45 - 31:52)
like landslide victories and it's like (31:48 - 31:55)
i guarantee you that was a bot match (31:52 - 31:58)
i mean no i know what i've had (31:55 - 32:00)
there are no bots but in in veteran (31:58 - 32:03)
which is after there are if you lose (32:00 - 32:05)
five matches in a row you are forced to (32:03 - 32:08)
bot match (32:05 - 32:10)
and to be fair like it does prevent you (32:08 - 32:12)
from ranking down so it's kind of nice (32:10 - 32:13)
i personally don't think it feels it (32:12 - 32:16)
feels depends on where it hits because i (32:13 - 32:18)
have ranked down and gotten a bot match (32:16 - 32:20)
after i've ranked down it's like too (32:18 - 32:22)
late (32:20 - 32:25)
i've i've already ranked down so (32:22 - 32:27)
uh this is getting me nothing (32:25 - 32:30)
uh also i will say that not all of those (32:27 - 32:32)
screen shots are bot matches because i (32:30 - 32:34)
have been (32:32 - 32:36)
stuck with an all human team and have (32:34 - 32:38)
just watched them get steamrolled and (32:36 - 32:41)
watch them do nothing but sit (32:38 - 32:43)
well some of them just sit and they're (32:41 - 32:45)
throwing the game and i'm like you are (32:43 - 32:47)
you are throwing this game i know you're (32:45 - 32:48)
throwing this game yeah it's easy to get (32:47 - 32:50)
a landslide it's gonna be a landslide (32:48 - 32:52)
because you because you've just thrown (32:50 - 32:54)
the game and i am immediately reporting (32:52 - 32:57)
you the minute we get done and i do uh i (32:54 - 33:00)
also i will i will tell this secret i've (32:57 - 33:02)
run out of black spots i have reached (33:00 - 33:04)
the max amount of people i can block (33:02 - 33:05)
what (33:04 - 33:06)
um (33:05 - 33:09)
i don't know you could block people yeah (33:06 - 33:10)
yeah it's like right i don't know the (33:09 - 33:11)
good job (33:10 - 33:13)
yep and like above the right i don't (33:11 - 33:14)
know and i can't see everybody who i (33:13 - 33:16)
blocked so i don't know how many that (33:14 - 33:19)
was but i was on a blocking spree for a (33:16 - 33:21)
while where i'm like no you literally (33:19 - 33:22)
sat there i never want to play with you (33:21 - 33:24)
again you threw this match yeah i don't (33:22 - 33:26)
want to deal with you ever again i don't (33:24 - 33:28)
want to play put in the situation i (33:26 - 33:31)
don't know why okay so now number two (33:28 - 33:33)
rule of what will make will anderson not (33:31 - 33:35)
like a game number one was if i have to (33:33 - 33:38)
do homework no number two if i have to (33:35 - 33:40)
prune my own garden (33:38 - 33:43)
for a good play experience i'm out no (33:40 - 33:45)
thank you i mean like i i have probably (33:43 - 33:47)
blocked like 10 or 12 people but they (33:45 - 33:50)
were people it wasn't like oh like (33:47 - 33:52)
everyone has a bad match you know (33:50 - 33:53)
there's there's been matches where it's (33:52 - 33:56)
like i was the worst i'm sorry i i was i (33:53 - 33:57)
didn't mean to throw i didn't mean to (33:56 - 34:00)
like keep walking in and dying (33:57 - 34:00)
um (34:00 - 34:02)
[Music] (34:00 - 34:04)
but if there's a person who (34:02 - 34:06)
is just sitting in base after two (34:04 - 34:08)
minutes and just giving up i never want (34:06 - 34:09)
to play with that person again like (34:08 - 34:12)
there's just too many times in unite (34:09 - 34:14)
where (34:12 - 34:16)
you are losing for eight minutes (34:14 - 34:18)
yeah and your team finally clicks and (34:16 - 34:20)
you get it together and you get zapdos (34:18 - 34:23)
and you start defending and you win (34:20 - 34:24)
there's just (34:23 - 34:26)
way too many times for that so if (34:24 - 34:28)
somebody two minutes in thinks the match (34:26 - 34:30)
is completely over i (34:28 - 34:31)
i don't even know if they know zapdos is (34:30 - 34:33)
in the game like (34:31 - 34:34)
have you gotten that far in the match (34:33 - 34:37)
like well what's also frustrating is (34:34 - 34:39)
if they had just disconnected (34:37 - 34:42)
the game will take over for that they'll (34:39 - 34:43)
realize they're disconnected and will (34:42 - 34:46)
run that one that was chosen as a bot (34:43 - 34:47)
these are people who are deliberately (34:46 - 34:50)
not disconnecting they are just staying (34:47 - 34:52)
in the game moving around every so often (34:50 - 34:54)
so that the game thinks oh they're still (34:52 - 34:58)
connected and throwing the game and it (34:54 - 35:00)
is (34:58 - 35:00)
so aggravating (35:00 - 35:04)
and i've run into them (35:02 - 35:06)
so many times which is why i met my max (35:04 - 35:07)
block (35:06 - 35:10)
yeah i haven't had (35:07 - 35:11)
i i probably (35:10 - 35:12)
almost all my blocks are probably the (35:11 - 35:15)
first week or two of the game this last (35:12 - 35:17)
week i haven't blocked anyone i think (35:15 - 35:21)
i've only reported one idol um (35:17 - 35:23)
i (35:21 - 35:26)
um anyways is just like a psychology (35:23 - 35:27)
thing i think (35:26 - 35:30)
with i also think like investment in a (35:27 - 35:31)
game (35:30 - 35:33)
will (35:31 - 35:35)
state how quickly you come back if (35:33 - 35:38)
there's a dlc right like (35:35 - 35:40)
people who are very invested into quest (35:38 - 35:41)
who really really like quests like they (35:40 - 35:43)
are people in slack who are buried at (35:41 - 35:45)
the game the dlc they really really love (35:43 - 35:47)
that game they were invested in the game (35:45 - 35:48)
and they're just waiting for a reason to (35:47 - 35:50)
go back (35:48 - 35:53)
your investment and how much it clicked (35:50 - 35:55)
with you like i barely played any quest (35:53 - 35:58)
i didn't find it all that enjoyable (35:55 - 36:00)
um and there's there's literally nothing (35:58 - 36:02)
that's gonna probably ever bring me back (36:00 - 36:03)
to that game because i just didn't enjoy (36:02 - 36:04)
it (36:03 - 36:06)
um (36:04 - 36:07)
and there's other games that you can be (36:06 - 36:11)
heavily invested in that once (36:07 - 36:14)
once you're done and you sort of (36:11 - 36:16)
reflect on it and you think actually i (36:14 - 36:18)
wasn't really having that much fun i was (36:16 - 36:18)
just (36:18 - 36:21)
i was just excited that it was new i (36:18 - 36:24)
wasn't enjoying myself that much also (36:21 - 36:26)
will stop you from going back like there (36:24 - 36:27)
are a lot of people who are very excited (36:26 - 36:29)
about quest coming out and played a lot (36:27 - 36:31)
of it but ultimately looking back at it (36:29 - 36:32)
like well (36:31 - 36:34)
did i enjoy the gameplay that much would (36:32 - 36:36)
new characters make me want to play that (36:34 - 36:38)
game again and honestly sometimes the (36:36 - 36:41)
answer is no um (36:38 - 36:43)
you know there's a million reasons as to (36:41 - 36:45)
why you stick with and why you leave a (36:43 - 36:48)
game a lot of them are just (36:45 - 36:49)
there are other things and if something (36:48 - 36:51)
catches your interests more and gives (36:49 - 36:54)
you a similar experience i'd rather play (36:51 - 36:56)
that than go back to this (36:54 - 36:59)
yeah (36:56 - 36:59)
well let's take a break uh when we come (36:59 - 37:05)
back we got some (37:02 - 37:08)
masters news (37:05 - 37:08)
that's actually it's actually kind of (37:09 - 37:12)
exciting masters news but uh we got some (37:10 - 37:13)
afternoons and we got some other stuff (37:12 - 37:16)
so we will be right back (37:13 - 37:16)

anniversary of pokemon masters yeah (38:15 - 38:20)
and they released the best pair (38:19 - 38:23)
beforehand and i got the best pair and i (38:20 - 38:26)
never need to play that game again (38:23 - 38:28)
uh you can go to my instagram to see the (38:26 - 38:30)
butt cape it is truly (38:28 - 38:31)
i thought you were talking about sydney (38:30 - 38:33)
and absal (38:31 - 38:34)
the best (38:33 - 38:35)
no (38:34 - 38:37)

suit leon in his side cut cutie outfit (38:37 - 38:43)
and his butt cape and his pulled back (38:41 - 38:44)
ponytail hair (38:43 - 38:47)
i had the best commentary on that of (38:44 - 38:49)
course cannot be repeated you cannot say (38:47 - 38:51)
these things because this is a good show (38:49 - 38:55)
and you are a bad person correct (38:51 - 38:57)
full disclosure i have a partnership (38:55 - 39:00)
with dna uh this is on pokemon.com hop (38:57 - 39:02)
and zamazenta and signa suit leon and (39:00 - 39:07)
eternitus are in pokemon masters ex (39:02 - 39:09)
from august 11th through september 15th (39:07 - 39:12)
the new pokemon masters ex legendary (39:09 - 39:16)
event howling shield of eternity brings (39:12 - 39:18)
reports of a mysterious meteor landing (39:16 - 39:20)
on the island along with the potential (39:18 - 39:23)
of the sighting of eternitis playing (39:20 - 39:25)
through this event will award you gems (39:23 - 39:27)
three star move support move candy 4 (39:25 - 39:30)
star strike move candy and a new sink (39:27 - 39:32)
pair of hop and zamasunta their hop is (39:30 - 39:34)
free you just have to yeah you just have (39:32 - 39:36)
to play the game (39:34 - 39:37)
as you play through the story of howling (39:36 - 39:39)
shield of eternity you will see hop (39:37 - 39:42)
gloria and leon team up with new friends (39:39 - 39:44)
to aid eternitis solving the mystery of (39:42 - 39:45)
the legendary pokemon's arrival may (39:44 - 39:47)
uncover the secrets of the dynamaxx (39:45 - 39:50)
phenomenon on pot on passio (39:47 - 39:53)
the event also debuts cigna suit leon (39:50 - 39:56)
and eternitus in sink pair scouts (39:53 - 39:58)
i think it's a fair scout right 10 (39:56 - 40:00)
yep (39:58 - 40:01)
they are currently the only sink pair (40:00 - 40:03)
capable of dynamaxing which they can do (40:01 - 40:06)
once per battle (40:03 - 40:06)
did they talk about the other leon being (40:08 - 40:11)
able to dynamics is that no press (40:09 - 40:14)
release because like that's gonna happen (40:11 - 40:15)
right like there's no way historizer (40:14 - 40:16)
doesn't dynamics (40:15 - 40:18)
yeah it (40:16 - 40:20)
i'm not (40:18 - 40:22)
overly thrilled at how dynamic saying (40:20 - 40:25)
has been put in the game (40:22 - 40:27)
um (40:25 - 40:29)
it's just weird (40:27 - 40:31)
it is it just not a sync i haven't well (40:29 - 40:33)
i don't have i thought eternities (40:31 - 40:35)
couldn't dynamics (40:33 - 40:39)
it oh so the story explains the change (40:35 - 40:42)
oh um but (40:39 - 40:44)
it doesn't actually change forms at (40:42 - 40:47)
least eternity doesn't and it is it is a (40:44 - 40:51)
dynamics move that you can click once (40:47 - 40:53)
whenever you want you can use it (40:51 - 40:55)
whenever you are it's not a sync move (40:53 - 40:56)
it's not a (40:55 - 40:58)
it's not a timed thing it's there from (40:56 - 41:00)
the beginning so if you want a dynamax (40:58 - 41:01)
at the opener (41:00 - 41:03)
you can do it but you can only ever do (41:01 - 41:06)
it once it is no it is fundamentally no (41:03 - 41:09)
different than a sink pair move except (41:06 - 41:10)
it's not on a timer (41:09 - 41:12)
and once you've used it it won't come (41:10 - 41:14)
back up again screenshot here it shows (41:12 - 41:17)
the hand version of eternitis yes so (41:14 - 41:21)
which is the dynomax form (41:17 - 41:24)
so it that's the animation for the move (41:21 - 41:26)
okay when you go back (41:24 - 41:28)
to the screen (41:26 - 41:29)
it turns out i see what you're saying it (41:28 - 41:31)
does not like so if you haven't played (41:29 - 41:34)
masters when you you can beg of all the (41:31 - 41:36)
masters (41:34 - 41:38)
in case anyone didn't like they still (41:36 - 41:40)
support megas in other games it's like (41:38 - 41:43)
it didn't disappear when (41:40 - 41:45)
i i feel like there's this (41:43 - 41:47)
there's this audience of pokemon players (41:45 - 41:49)
that once sword and shield came out they (41:47 - 41:50)
thought like (41:49 - 41:53)
megas completely got vanished no they (41:50 - 41:56)
exist in other games in other games (41:53 - 41:58)
they're in pokemon go they're masters so (41:56 - 42:01)
when you use a sync move in masters on (41:58 - 42:03)
stephen's metagross (42:01 - 42:07)
it will mega evolve into mega metagross (42:03 - 42:08)
yep (42:07 - 42:12)
and it will look like mega metagross and (42:08 - 42:15)
it will have different moves once not (42:12 - 42:16)
like not (42:15 - 42:19)
it might change like two moves but it (42:16 - 42:20)
will have different moves (42:19 - 42:22)
as a mega (42:20 - 42:27)
but what you're saying is eternitis (42:22 - 42:27)
dynamaxes for the turn and then after (42:27 - 42:32)
the animation is over it goes back to (42:30 - 42:33)
normal it's back to normal i'm going to (42:32 - 42:35)
verify it again in case i've missed (42:33 - 42:37)
something but i i i don't ever remember (42:35 - 42:39)
it staying the hand for the rest of the (42:37 - 42:41)
battle let me go into (42:39 - 42:44)
something quick (42:41 - 42:46)
we'll go there (42:44 - 42:51)
uh we'll go there we'll hit ready (42:46 - 42:51)
and i will because i usually just finish (42:51 - 42:54)
the game with it but i will start the (42:52 - 42:56)
game by by doing the dynamax (42:54 - 43:01)
uh dynamics dynamics (42:56 - 43:01)
oh come on (43:01 - 43:04)
uh i'm trying to see if they mention (43:05 - 43:09)
anything about charizard or dreadna in (43:06 - 43:11)
this press release i i would just assume (43:09 - 43:12)
that that's (43:11 - 43:15)
i mean they say other ones will but they (43:12 - 43:16)
don't say (43:15 - 43:19)
well i mean like come on it's kind of (43:16 - 43:20)
obvious which ones are going to and (43:19 - 43:22)
which ones are not going to (43:20 - 43:24)
yeah so i get the hand animation see (43:22 - 43:26)
there's the hand oh i see the hand it (43:24 - 43:28)
does its big beam (43:26 - 43:31)
it blows everything up (43:28 - 43:33)
and then when i go back to the screen (43:31 - 43:35)
you can see it it is oh it's regular i (43:33 - 43:37)
see it regular plain old regular (43:35 - 43:38)
which (43:37 - 43:41)
uh (43:38 - 43:42)
it's kind of a bummer (43:41 - 43:45)
like megas are more exciting (43:42 - 43:46)
uh (43:45 - 43:48)
and (43:46 - 43:48)
i don't know i expected it to at least (43:49 - 43:54)
like change form for for three (43:51 - 43:56)
countdowns or something but it is (43:54 - 43:59)
literally just a off clock (43:56 - 44:01)
one-time sync move and that's very (43:59 - 44:03)
powerful but (44:01 - 44:06)
so are all the sync moves it it feels it (44:03 - 44:09)
feels implemented a little a little (44:06 - 44:11)
disappointing just to turn a test maybe (44:09 - 44:13)
charizard will be like three it could be (44:11 - 44:15)
i mean this is the only example that we (44:13 - 44:17)
have and it turned and i mean even (44:15 - 44:20)
though it does do the hand form (44:17 - 44:21)
that would be (44:20 - 44:23)
it doesn't stay big and cloudy it just (44:21 - 44:25)
goes right back to normal and i don't (44:23 - 44:27)
know how they're going to implement it (44:25 - 44:29)
for the other ones and maybe they will (44:27 - 44:30)
take on their other form for three (44:29 - 44:32)
countdowns (44:30 - 44:34)
who knows but right now i'm not apart (44:32 - 44:36)
from the fact that leon looks amazing i (44:34 - 44:39)
have not been too impressed by (44:36 - 44:41)
the addition of dynamics his outfit's (44:39 - 44:44)
real good it's so good i'm trying to get (44:41 - 44:46)
a number of cosplayers i know to create (44:44 - 44:47)
the outfit (44:46 - 44:50)
do it do it dude (44:47 - 44:51)
there is a (44:50 - 44:53)
five star select special scout (44:51 - 44:56)
coming soon which features b and nessa (44:53 - 44:58)
and then up for the (44:56 - 45:00)
run-up to the two-year rally (44:58 - 45:03)
um you can get up to 2600 gems just by (45:00 - 45:05)
logging in (45:03 - 45:07)
i'm so curious who's gonna be in the (45:05 - 45:10)
two-year anniversary (45:07 - 45:10)
what champion have they are they gonna (45:11 - 45:15)
change the name of the game again (45:13 - 45:17)
maybe for the two-year (45:15 - 45:19)
anniversary okay (45:17 - 45:22)
let's never forget that (45:19 - 45:24)
their hashtag (45:22 - 45:28)
pokemon masters uh triple x (45:24 - 45:29)
this is (45:28 - 45:31)
going into the third year didn't work (45:29 - 45:33)
for i mean maybe it did work honestly (45:31 - 45:35)
because (45:33 - 45:37)
that was the talk of the town that day (45:35 - 45:38)
when they started using that new hashtag (45:37 - 45:41)
for pokemon masters ex (45:38 - 45:44)
drew a lot of attention to the game true (45:41 - 45:46)
i'd like there's nobody on this on the (45:44 - 45:48)
launch screen that isn't in the game now (45:46 - 45:51)
that i remember (45:48 - 45:51)
they've added everybody (45:51 - 45:56)
they've added sigma suits of all the (45:53 - 45:57)
kanto (45:56 - 45:59)
folk so (45:57 - 46:01)
we're tapped out (45:59 - 46:02)
the there are (46:01 - 46:05)
professors left we don't have birch we (46:02 - 46:06)
don't have elm we don't have okay (46:05 - 46:07)
juniper (46:06 - 46:10)
there's zero people in the world being (46:07 - 46:12)
like oh man i'm gonna pick this game up (46:10 - 46:14)
what professor birch gets at it because (46:12 - 46:16)
we have sycamore (46:14 - 46:18)
yeah okay he has xerneas (46:16 - 46:20)
which is (46:18 - 46:22)
literally get zernius and you beat the (46:20 - 46:24)
game every time xerneas is so crazy (46:22 - 46:27)
powerful (46:24 - 46:27)
yeah there's there's not very many (46:29 - 46:34)
champions that they haven't added either (46:30 - 46:34)
because (46:34 - 46:37)
i mean alder's in the game (46:37 - 46:41)
cynthia's in the game diane is in the (46:39 - 46:44)
game leon's in the game twice (46:41 - 46:46)
gary's in the game (46:44 - 46:49)
twice (46:46 - 46:51)
uh steven stone's in the game wallace (46:49 - 46:54)
isn't well they just added faulkner you (46:51 - 46:57)
know people were (46:54 - 46:57)
uh they added uh bugsy and scyther (46:57 - 47:02)
yeah i don't know who's li i don't i'm (47:03 - 47:05)
just people like oh wait for the two (47:04 - 47:07)
year wait for the two year and i'm like (47:05 - 47:09)
why i don't know who's coming in the two (47:07 - 47:11)
year and sigma suit leon (47:09 - 47:13)
looks real good and i got it first pull (47:11 - 47:15)
first but here's the thing of gotcha (47:13 - 47:18)
games is would they do this all the time (47:15 - 47:20)
they like something exciting happens and (47:18 - 47:22)
they put out something to like bait you (47:20 - 47:25)
into spending your gems before that (47:22 - 47:27)
like (47:25 - 47:29)
i don't think faulkner or sydney were (47:27 - 47:32)
good bait but they were obviously bait (47:29 - 47:35)
before leon but leon is bait for (47:32 - 47:37)
something leon (47:35 - 47:38)
to say (47:37 - 47:40)
leon is bait is to do a disservice of (47:38 - 47:44)
how incredible leon looks in that outfit (47:40 - 47:45)
oh he looks great he looks great he (47:44 - 47:47)
looks fantastic and it is a tournament (47:45 - 47:49)
and eternity is a great partner it is a (47:47 - 47:53)
good attacker like if (47:49 - 47:53)
where he loses the cape (48:01 - 48:05)
oh okay he's (48:03 - 48:08)
definitely yeah if if leon loses the (48:05 - 48:11)
cape i'm putting money into the game (48:08 - 48:13)
look their whole goal with this mobile (48:11 - 48:16)
game is to make money right (48:13 - 48:19)
their two-year anniversary like there's (48:16 - 48:20)
there has to be something better than (48:19 - 48:23)
leon which is hard to top (48:20 - 48:27)
what is better to beat than than super (48:23 - 48:30)
hot leon in his side maybe possibly like (48:27 - 48:32)
cigna suit ramos you know people are (48:30 - 48:33)
really (48:32 - 48:35)
i mean (48:33 - 48:38)
if they do if they do a good rama (48:35 - 48:41)
i i'm i could be there (48:38 - 48:41)
you never know if this is bait (48:43 - 48:50)
this feels like the best bait they've (48:46 - 48:53)
ever done because it is 100 worth it to (48:50 - 48:54)
have this guy (48:53 - 48:57)
wandering around your pokemon center (48:54 - 48:58)
saying hi to you (48:57 - 49:00)
and you're like yeah hi leon let's go (48:58 - 49:04)
well i mean leona's best champion (49:00 - 49:06)
correct (49:04 - 49:08)
they could do a signa suit deantha there (49:06 - 49:10)
you go oh yeah i mean i'm into that too (49:08 - 49:12)
see that's bait or that's not bait (49:10 - 49:14)
that's like but no i shouldn't think (49:12 - 49:17)
that that's better than signa suit leon (49:14 - 49:19)
and how amazing that outfit is (49:17 - 49:21)
i mean the weird thing is they've been (49:19 - 49:24)
adding weird pairs to the bp system (49:21 - 49:28)
like we got the rose champion and entei (49:24 - 49:32)
in there and i'm like what (49:28 - 49:33)
why is she in here (49:32 - 49:36)
where did this come from although the vp (49:33 - 49:39)
system is really good (49:36 - 49:39)
yeah i don't i don't know what they will (49:39 - 49:43)
do for two years besides like the thing (49:41 - 49:45)
i feel like i do know is they're like (49:43 - 49:49)
okay dreadnough charizard um what's the (49:45 - 49:50)
other one that was added like the these (49:49 - 49:52)
could not dynamics (49:50 - 49:54)
i'm sure that they're doing that (49:52 - 49:57)
i mean i would imagine that the only (49:54 - 49:58)
thing i can think of is there might be (49:57 - 50:01)
some sort of g-max (49:58 - 50:02)
pikachu (50:01 - 50:04)
uh (50:02 - 50:06)
but would they le would it be i feel (50:04 - 50:09)
like that's an event to get that to be (50:06 - 50:11)
your pair like they did with (50:09 - 50:13)
solgaleo and (50:11 - 50:16)
what other one they did that with where (50:13 - 50:18)
you fight through the thing and then at (50:16 - 50:20)
the end you can partner with this (50:18 - 50:23)
special pikachu that can yeah gigantomax (50:20 - 50:25)
even if they i don't know even if they (50:23 - 50:27)
release like opal (50:25 - 50:28)
or (50:27 - 50:30)
milo (50:28 - 50:32)
like that's i know you like milo but (50:30 - 50:36)
that's not nearly as exciting as leon (50:32 - 50:38)
like champions are always more exciting (50:36 - 50:40)
than the gym leaders for them for most (50:38 - 50:42)
people i mean for most people i mean i (50:40 - 50:44)
would spend my i i won't spend money on (50:42 - 50:46)
my life i will spend all my coins on (50:44 - 50:48)
milo and then when i don't get it i'll (50:46 - 50:49)
be mad and stop playing the game for (50:48 - 50:52)
three weeks (50:49 - 50:54)
but i'm i'm literally just like people (50:52 - 50:55)
are like oh the two years should be (50:54 - 50:57)
super super great and i'm still (50:55 - 50:59)
struggling to figure out (50:57 - 51:01)
how they top (50:59 - 51:03)
the two year was pretty good (51:01 - 51:04)
we got we got (51:03 - 51:07)
leaf and red that was the one year (51:04 - 51:10)
i'm saying what what oh sorry (51:07 - 51:11)
what tops (51:10 - 51:12)
this leon (51:11 - 51:15)
nothing (51:12 - 51:15)
nothing if they were so confident to put (51:15 - 51:21)
out this leon and for like if you if you (51:18 - 51:22)
have not played masters if you've made (51:21 - 51:24)
it through this segment you need to go (51:22 - 51:26)

mere bee and luna cola come into the (51:42 - 51:48)
game mirror b and ludicolo i was off to (51:45 - 51:52)
spend money on that (51:48 - 51:52)
yeah mirror b i'm in i would also waste (51:52 - 51:57)
all my coins on (51:55 - 51:59)
on mirror b (51:57 - 52:00)
oh man (51:59 - 52:03)

yeah guzman's in it (52:05 - 52:10)
cyrus lucamine's in it cyrus is in it (52:07 - 52:12)

giovanna (52:18 - 52:20)
uh (52:19 - 52:22)
archie and maxie are in it (52:20 - 52:24)
yeah uh they could probably have (52:22 - 52:26)
scissors in it (52:24 - 52:28)
they haven't added a courtney (52:26 - 52:30)
technically (52:28 - 52:33)
okay they could do sigma suit n (52:30 - 52:36)
yeah yeah yeah (52:33 - 52:38)
i think cigna suit de antha would go (52:36 - 52:40)
more than and would (52:38 - 52:42)
i don't know people like n a lot of (52:40 - 52:43)
people like really like people like the (52:42 - 52:46)
anthem though i love diantha so i use (52:43 - 52:48)

i mean that's already has paracorous (52:57 - 53:02)
faulkner (53:00 - 53:02)
or cindy cindy was an ad that i was not (53:05 - 53:10)
expecting (53:08 - 53:12)
at all because i had forgotten that (53:10 - 53:15)
sydney existed (53:12 - 53:17)
uh yeah (53:15 - 53:17)
like what is sydney even from (53:19 - 53:23)
which ca if you even forget what game (53:22 - 53:25)
cindy's from (53:23 - 53:27)
is he not from owen (53:25 - 53:30)
is he not e4 holland oh he is e4 owen (53:27 - 53:33)
god i forget he exists every time the (53:30 - 53:37)
whole elite four is not great (53:33 - 53:38)
they're a lot of forgettable until you (53:37 - 53:41)
get up to stephen stone and wallace wow (53:38 - 53:43)
well okay i'll take that back phoebe is (53:41 - 53:45)
amazing (53:43 - 53:47)
uh drake is forgettable (53:45 - 53:51)
uh is it who's the ice person glacia (53:47 - 53:54)
oh glacia she's already in the game (53:51 - 53:56)
and forgettable (53:54 - 53:58)
yeah i forget her all the time she's no (53:56 - 54:02)
canned to ice she's no canned ice (53:58 - 54:02)
who is missing wand is missing (54:04 - 54:08)
uh (54:07 - 54:10)
okay you know (54:08 - 54:12)
again (54:10 - 54:15)
i think what is missing falls into the (54:12 - 54:16)
faulkner department (54:15 - 54:22)
[Laughter] (54:16 - 54:22)
uh is there any champion (54:23 - 54:28)
no i think that's no they've done all (54:27 - 54:30)
the champions i i could i literally (54:28 - 54:33)
could not figure out who (54:30 - 54:36)
who this incredible (54:33 - 54:39)
this incredible leon would possibly be (54:36 - 54:40)
bait for like (54:39 - 54:42)
how are you going to exceed what you (54:40 - 54:44)
just did for the two year and i don't (54:42 - 54:46)
think they can (54:44 - 54:48)
i mean they could do another red with a (54:46 - 54:51)
gigantic max pikachu (54:48 - 54:54)
yeah but you i feel like that (54:51 - 54:56)
is weird since you have your own pikachu (54:54 - 54:57)
and that's how you start the game i (54:56 - 55:00)
think it's weird to give (54:57 - 55:02)
a giganta max pikachu not to your (55:00 - 55:05)
character who's had pikachu the entire (55:02 - 55:07)
time they could do (55:05 - 55:09)
and i'd like a (55:07 - 55:12)
jesse and james with gigantomax meowth (55:09 - 55:14)
they couldn't do that (55:12 - 55:16)
in the anime technically (55:14 - 55:17)
yeah (55:16 - 55:18)
i mean jesse and james were thinking but (55:17 - 55:20)
who would they give it to jesse or james (55:18 - 55:21)
or would they do it both they could do (55:20 - 55:24)
both i mean what does matter weird (55:21 - 55:25)
but sure (55:24 - 55:28)
yeah (55:25 - 55:28)
do we (55:29 - 55:32)
i i don't unite a stall in the mind (55:30 - 55:33)
before we move to like question the week (55:32 - 55:34)
pokemon of the week do we have anything (55:33 - 55:36)
on unite (55:34 - 55:38)
i mean (55:36 - 55:38)
i'm super frustrated by the by the (55:38 - 55:43)
play to win aspect of it (55:41 - 55:47)
uh i haven't paid to win or play to win (55:43 - 55:49)
because playing to win seems appropriate (55:47 - 55:50)
pay to win (55:49 - 55:54)
pay to win the pay-to-win (55:50 - 55:55)
so (55:54 - 55:56)
uh (55:55 - 55:58)
it is it is a hard wall (55:56 - 56:00)
that if you do not want to level your (55:58 - 56:02)
stuff past (56:00 - 56:05)
20. you have a rough road 20 yeah (56:02 - 56:07)
i'll tell you the secret (56:05 - 56:09)
stop playing ranked (56:07 - 56:12)
and just play unranked free-for-alls (56:09 - 56:14)
yeah and have some this is the clash (56:12 - 56:16)
royale problem i i mean i did do i i (56:14 - 56:18)
tried to go into (56:16 - 56:20)
unranked free-for-all and the amount of (56:18 - 56:21)
people that just had no idea what they (56:20 - 56:23)
were doing was more frustrating than (56:21 - 56:26)
playing ranked where i was where i lose (56:23 - 56:27)
all the time because (56:26 - 56:29)
i can't move out of my bracket (56:27 - 56:32)
because i think the way it pulls the way (56:29 - 56:35)
it pulls people to play (56:32 - 56:37)
is tough (56:35 - 56:40)
because you are at a point where (56:37 - 56:42)
people if it's pulling from expert or (56:40 - 56:44)
lower they can't move past 20 in their (56:42 - 56:45)
items until they hit veteran and when it (56:44 - 56:47)
opens up to level at the 30. and if (56:45 - 56:49)
you're playing above that everybody has (56:47 - 56:50)
leveled way beyond in their stats or (56:49 - 56:51)
something i think you need to be a (56:50 - 56:52)
veteran i think you just need to be an (56:51 - 56:54)
expert to go past 30. or whenever it (56:52 - 56:58)
happens yeah but like it is a hard wall (56:54 - 57:00)
to hit and it is a frustrating wall (56:58 - 57:01)
especially (57:00 - 57:03)
since (57:01 - 57:06)
if you leveled up a number of items and (57:03 - 57:08)
the most recent patch made a bunch of (57:06 - 57:11)
those items no longer worth the level (57:08 - 57:14)
you can't undo those upgrades (57:11 - 57:16)
so like shell bell was great because it (57:14 - 57:19)
did cool down and it made elder goss's (57:16 - 57:21)
heels really strong because the cooldown (57:19 - 57:24)
was a lot less well now that the the (57:21 - 57:26)
cooldown was extended so much the three (57:24 - 57:27)
percent that you got (57:26 - 57:30)
doesn't make enough of a difference to (57:27 - 57:33)
keep using that item so i had shell ball (57:30 - 57:34)
up to 20 (57:33 - 57:37)
and now i had to level a different item (57:34 - 57:42)
to replace it up to 20 and that is (57:37 - 57:44)
in that process if i didn't want to (57:42 - 57:46)
spend money i had to earn (57:44 - 57:48)
gems playing with a subpar item either (57:46 - 57:50)
way (57:48 - 57:52)
it's just it is it is an aspect of the (57:50 - 57:55)
game that i i really hope (57:52 - 57:58)
leaves very quickly i didn't like it (57:55 - 58:00)
when it started i really hate it now and (57:58 - 58:01)
i think it is (58:00 - 58:05)
already becoming a problem in the game (58:01 - 58:05)
i i think it is a problem i don't wanna (58:05 - 58:10)
i'm not going to defend that it's not (58:08 - 58:11)
but (58:10 - 58:13)
when the season is over you're going to (58:11 - 58:16)
get so many tickets (58:13 - 58:18)
depending on where you rank (58:16 - 58:20)
um so (58:18 - 58:22)
you if you're ranking veteran i think (58:20 - 58:24)
you're getting (58:22 - 58:27)
fifteen thousand tickets or something (58:24 - 58:27)
yeah (58:27 - 58:29)
the season ends in (58:27 - 58:32)
forty eight days yeah which is enough (58:29 - 58:34)
time it's enough to max one item (58:32 - 58:36)
completely to 30 (58:34 - 58:39)
and i think if anyone's listing the show (58:36 - 58:41)
the item you max is buddy barrier (58:39 - 58:43)
because it is probably the most (58:41 - 58:45)
versatile item (58:43 - 58:47)
like even if you're like ah buddy (58:45 - 58:48)
barrier doesn't really work on i don't (58:47 - 58:50)
know it works on every pokemon but even (58:48 - 58:52)
if you were like i don't think it works (58:50 - 58:55)
on mr mime it's like well it's not bad (58:52 - 58:57)
on mr mime it's not like it's literally (58:55 - 58:59)
not a bad item for any pokemon it's not (58:57 - 59:01)
the best item for every pokemon but it's (58:59 - 59:02)
it's one of the like that's how i think (59:01 - 59:04)
about it is like okay if i'm going to (59:02 - 59:07)
upgrade items because i i have i think i (59:04 - 59:08)
only have four (59:07 - 59:11)
items at level 20. um and then i have a (59:08 - 59:13)
bunch of tickets i just refuse to spend (59:11 - 59:14)
them because i don't want to get into (59:13 - 59:16)
the situation where (59:14 - 59:18)
you know i put everything into shell (59:16 - 59:19)
bell and shaw bell is broken or (59:18 - 59:21)
shelble's not good anymore or (59:19 - 59:24)
um so 20 has been good i mean i've (59:21 - 59:25)
talked to a lot of people that have made (59:24 - 59:27)
it to master rank they've all made it to (59:25 - 59:30)
items with it being at 20. there's like (59:27 - 59:33)
this new i don't know game on (59:30 - 59:35)
twitch where a bunch of streamers made (59:33 - 59:37)
new accounts so they can be like i'm (59:35 - 59:39)
free to play to masters and you know (59:37 - 59:40)
they're good players so they end up (59:39 - 59:43)
getting the masters anyways i don't (59:40 - 59:44)
i had somebody come to my chat and be (59:43 - 59:46)
like oh is this your alternative account (59:44 - 59:48)
oh buddy (59:46 - 59:51)
i got no alt account i got time to play (59:48 - 59:54)
this game twice no i'm one account it's (59:51 - 59:57)
fine i have no desire i i i get it it's (59:54 - 59:59)
like content it's like a fun challenge (59:57 - 60:00)
to be like i'm going to play this game (59:59 - 60:02)
again and i'm going to do free to play (60:00 - 60:04)
and it's like it's the nuzlocke of unite (60:02 - 60:07)
is what it is yeah and it's like i don't (60:04 - 60:09)
want to make a new account i don't also (60:07 - 60:11)
the the sort of thing behind that is you (60:09 - 60:13)
made an account after you know how to (60:11 - 60:15)
play the game right like you have (60:13 - 60:17)
already on your main account know which (60:15 - 60:19)
items to upgrade (60:17 - 60:20)
so yeah you're free to play but you're (60:19 - 60:23)
free to play with a ton of knowledge (60:20 - 60:25)
that you gained from your other account (60:23 - 60:28)
so you are using what you did to target (60:25 - 60:31)
exactly the characters that you want to (60:28 - 60:33)
level that you're good at and you know (60:31 - 60:37)
exactly which items to level it is it is (60:33 - 60:40)
not an even playing field at that point (60:37 - 60:42)
either because you have three weeks of (60:40 - 60:44)
experience you're not starting over (60:42 - 60:46)
again you know exactly how to target (60:44 - 60:47)
your games yeah (60:46 - 60:50)
and (60:47 - 60:50)
it's also difficult to like (60:51 - 60:55)
level items to level the (60:56 - 61:01)
four or five items that are good across (60:59 - 61:03)
multiple characters like (61:01 - 61:05)
you sort of have to say i'm gonna do a (61:03 - 61:07)
subpar (61:05 - 61:09)
build on a couple of things that if i (61:07 - 61:11)
can't play the main i'm gonna do with (61:09 - 61:12)
these (61:11 - 61:13)
um (61:12 - 61:15)
it is just it is a (61:13 - 61:18)
it is a frustrating solo experience um (61:15 - 61:20)
i'm getting to the point where i'm like (61:18 - 61:21)
do i really want to continue doing (61:20 - 61:24)
ranked if i'm not in a group that i can (61:21 - 61:27)
talk to or at least i have a level of (61:24 - 61:28)
confidence that (61:27 - 61:30)
they are (61:28 - 61:32)
not gonna stand in the end zone they're (61:30 - 61:35)
not gonna do xyz you know they're not (61:32 - 61:37)
gonna throw a match like (61:35 - 61:40)
what like what is my path forward of (61:37 - 61:41)
unite (61:40 - 61:43)
um (61:41 - 61:46)
and what does that look like given given (61:43 - 61:47)
the sort of (61:46 - 61:50)
uh as more people get to the same skill (61:47 - 61:53)
level of the game the pay aspect becomes (61:50 - 61:55)
way more prevalent (61:53 - 61:56)
see i i (61:55 - 62:00)
have not hit that paywall (61:56 - 62:02)
um (62:00 - 62:02)
i'm not saying it doesn't exist (62:02 - 62:08)
uh like i'm i'm as of this recording i'm (62:05 - 62:10)
veteran three (62:08 - 62:11)
and (62:10 - 62:13)
the last time i play i haven't played in (62:11 - 62:15)
like two days because i've just had time (62:13 - 62:16)
off (62:15 - 62:19)
um the last time i played uh we i did a (62:16 - 62:21)
three a group of three (62:19 - 62:24)
it's me two other people and then (62:21 - 62:25)
two randoms (62:24 - 62:27)
and we won (62:25 - 62:29)
we won one we lost one then we won seven (62:27 - 62:31)
in a row and then we lost one so we (62:29 - 62:33)
ended up going like eight and two for (62:31 - 62:35)
the night or something yeah i mean it's (62:33 - 62:36)
a very different experience when you can (62:35 - 62:38)
get at least (62:36 - 62:41)
two other people who who kind of know (62:38 - 62:44)
what's going on and you have you have (62:41 - 62:46)
all those slightly delayed communication (62:44 - 62:49)
yeah well in that situation (62:46 - 62:53)
of these eight matches two uh yeah we (62:49 - 62:55)
won eight one eight lost two so in these (62:53 - 62:56)
ten matches (62:55 - 62:58)
we were (62:56 - 63:00)
completely stomped by another team it (62:58 - 63:03)
was like we we ended up ending the match (63:00 - 63:04)
at like (63:03 - 63:07)
level 11 or 12 and they were all level (63:04 - 63:08)
15. (63:07 - 63:11)
and like that's a huge disadvantage in (63:08 - 63:13)
that game like if somebody like if (63:11 - 63:14)
you're (63:13 - 63:17)
zero or over zero aura and you're 10 and (63:14 - 63:19)
they're 12 (63:17 - 63:21)
they're just gonna win yep (63:19 - 63:23)
like the level advantage in that game is (63:21 - 63:24)
is very (63:23 - 63:26)
it's not bad it's just that's how the (63:24 - 63:27)
game is (63:26 - 63:29)
um and being self-aware of like oh gosh (63:27 - 63:32)
you know that this (63:29 - 63:34)
this person's two to three levels higher (63:32 - 63:35)
than me i just can't beat them without (63:34 - 63:37)
support (63:35 - 63:38)
it's just part of the game and it's fine (63:37 - 63:40)
like i'm not complaining about it it's (63:38 - 63:42)
just you just got to be aware of that (63:40 - 63:45)
and they just completely stomped us and (63:42 - 63:46)
i wanna (63:45 - 63:48)
and like it's like well they were better (63:46 - 63:50)
like they were probably all outcomes (63:48 - 63:51)
they were probably a team (63:50 - 63:52)
but (63:51 - 63:54)
i i like you look back at that situation (63:52 - 63:55)
i was like i have no clue how they did (63:54 - 63:57)
it like even (63:55 - 63:58)
even in our games when we get (63:57 - 64:01)
dreadnought both times maybe even three (63:58 - 64:03)
times i don't even like i i don't think (64:01 - 64:05)
i've ever been a game where i'm 15. (64:03 - 64:08)
maybe 13 maybe like i'm always 12 when (64:05 - 64:09)
zapdos appears and if i'm not 12 when (64:08 - 64:11)
zap disappears i'm playing poorly (64:09 - 64:13)
something happened where (64:11 - 64:15)
like dreadnought or not i can be level (64:13 - 64:17)
12 by zapdos (64:15 - 64:19)
um (64:17 - 64:21)
and i can't help but think that was like (64:19 - 64:24)
oh you've you've paid your money (64:21 - 64:27)
and you're a team and that's like we got (64:24 - 64:29)
completely stopped like so whatever if (64:27 - 64:30)
whether or not they paid money they were (64:29 - 64:32)
they were the better team and i wasn't (64:30 - 64:33)
super salty about it and it's like we (64:32 - 64:35)
won seven in a row we got completely (64:33 - 64:36)
destroyed by this team like it's really (64:35 - 64:38)
hard to be upset like seven in a row is (64:36 - 64:42)
really good at um veteran (64:38 - 64:43)
so (64:42 - 64:45)
i haven't hit that like oh every team is (64:43 - 64:48)
stomping us but i do think (64:45 - 64:50)
three up is better than five up as at (64:48 - 64:52)
least right now yeah (64:50 - 64:54)
because i mean (64:52 - 64:56)
is good if you have communications five (64:54 - 64:57)
but the problem with five up is you're (64:56 - 64:59)
gonna you're gonna get against another (64:57 - 65:02)
five up that has communication (64:59 - 65:02)
so here's the question (65:02 - 65:05)
do you like hard (65:04 - 65:07)
to introduce (65:05 - 65:11)
inability to re-watch a match (65:07 - 65:12)
i think they're adding that they did (65:11 - 65:14)
like a three-day yeah testing i don't (65:12 - 65:16)
think that they can do like a full (65:14 - 65:19)
esports competitive without that because (65:16 - 65:21)
that would give you the ability to sit (65:19 - 65:23)
and watch oh yeah right yeah i would (65:21 - 65:24)
love to be able to see what they were (65:23 - 65:25)
doing (65:24 - 65:28)
but yeah how did you get to 15 so fast (65:25 - 65:31)
like let me let me see your path i mean (65:28 - 65:33)
while i hit was that veteran four (65:31 - 65:35)
and i have since dropped down to veteran (65:33 - 65:38)
one from four like (65:35 - 65:40)
i have just had a solo queue has been (65:38 - 65:41)
real (65:40 - 65:42)
real real rough (65:41 - 65:44)
uh which i'm like i think i need to play (65:42 - 65:46)
with people but the the hard wall i hit (65:44 - 65:48)
was in veteran i hit it at four and (65:46 - 65:52)
nothing i could do could get past it (65:48 - 65:52)
yeah i mean going back to like the the (65:52 - 65:57)
twitch meta game of you know free to (65:54 - 65:58)
play (65:57 - 66:01)
solo only to master rank and like lots (65:58 - 66:03)
of people have done that (66:01 - 66:05)
i mean these people the thing that i (66:03 - 66:08)
like i kind of i was i was kind of like (66:05 - 66:10)
jaded slash bummed (66:08 - 66:12)
that (66:10 - 66:14)
you know i'm a very competitive person i (66:12 - 66:15)
play a lot of competitive games outside (66:14 - 66:18)
of stream um you know i i always did (66:15 - 66:20)
like trials of osiris and destiny (66:18 - 66:23)
uh you know i've done vgc stuff i've (66:20 - 66:25)
done tcg stuff (66:23 - 66:27)
and so i was like a little bummed i was (66:25 - 66:29)
telling greg this it's like oh man i'm (66:27 - 66:30)
seeing all these people get to master (66:29 - 66:34)
rank and i'm not master rank yet and of (66:30 - 66:35)
like a lot of these people have like 700 (66:34 - 66:37)
games under their belt and i'm only at (66:35 - 66:40)
like 220 or something (66:37 - 66:43)
but the thing i forgot is (66:40 - 66:43)
all of these people were secret league (66:43 - 66:49)
of legends players for like seven years (66:45 - 66:50)
and then when i thought about it i was (66:49 - 66:51)
like (66:50 - 66:53)
i'm thinking about streamer friends that (66:51 - 66:55)
are all master rank and it's like (66:53 - 66:57)
i didn't realize that you've been (66:55 - 66:59)
playing league of legends since like (66:57 - 67:01)
2012 like 100 (66:59 - 67:06)
absolutely true it's insane how (67:01 - 67:08)
you don't think about it well like (67:06 - 67:10)
people like some people like they live (67:08 - 67:11)
and breathe league of legends right (67:10 - 67:13)
they're consistently talking about it (67:11 - 67:15)
and then some people are like i would i (67:13 - 67:16)
don't this is my guilty pleasure i play (67:15 - 67:21)
at like 4 a.m when no one's online and (67:16 - 67:23)
it's a big like it's a reason why league (67:21 - 67:24)
of legends is like top three game on (67:23 - 67:26)
twitch all the time like (67:24 - 67:29)
people love that game and hate that game (67:26 - 67:31)
well i think people also just like (67:29 - 67:33)
one thing in what you just said people (67:31 - 67:36)
don't realize how long league has been (67:33 - 67:38)
around yeah right i forget that it's (67:36 - 67:40)
been around for such a long time i was (67:38 - 67:44)
playing in 2012 2013. i was playing (67:40 - 67:46)
eight years ago (67:44 - 67:47)
and there are people who have just (67:46 - 67:49)
consistently played throughout that (67:47 - 67:52)
entire time (67:49 - 67:52)
and this is my first moba so like (67:53 - 67:56)
it's been (67:55 - 67:59)
baby's first moba yeah (67:56 - 68:01)
i mean it's also sort of a thing where i (67:59 - 68:03)
watch like i watch master (68:01 - 68:04)
people playing (68:03 - 68:06)
the characters that i play and i'm like (68:04 - 68:09)
i do all these things (68:06 - 68:11)
and like (68:09 - 68:13)
without without the ability to sort of (68:11 - 68:16)
look back and see exactly what the other (68:13 - 68:18)
people were doing with what i was doing (68:16 - 68:21)
it's hard to grow (68:18 - 68:23)
doing it by myself which i think i sort (68:21 - 68:26)
of needed to get like three people and (68:23 - 68:28)
like let's just knock it let's just play (68:26 - 68:30)
some so i can (68:28 - 68:33)
you know it's also hard being support (68:30 - 68:34)
when people don't (68:33 - 68:36)
people just leave you i'm like well i (68:34 - 68:38)
guess i'm going with everybody else (68:36 - 68:40)
because i literally could do nothing by (68:38 - 68:43)
my own down here you've all left (68:40 - 68:45)
and you didn't signal you were leaving i (68:43 - 68:48)
just looked and oh you're all up there (68:45 - 68:50)
all right it i mean it also doesn't it (68:48 - 68:52)
also doesn't help that like the meta is (68:50 - 68:54)
still changing like yes i think we said (68:52 - 68:56)
last week you know no one cared about (68:54 - 68:58)
dreadnought when the game first came out (68:56 - 69:01)
and everyone cared about rotom and now (68:58 - 69:03)
like dreadnought it like no one cares (69:01 - 69:04)
about rotom and everyone cares about (69:03 - 69:06)
dreadnaught (69:04 - 69:08)
and there's like this weird meta game (69:06 - 69:11)
with zapdos (69:08 - 69:11)
and it's (69:11 - 69:15)
some people still don't like zapdos (69:13 - 69:17)
um (69:15 - 69:19)
i like zapdos (69:17 - 69:21)
i'm fine with it it is a ketchup (69:19 - 69:22)
mechanic (69:21 - 69:24)
and it is (69:22 - 69:25)
when you sort of realize that the (69:24 - 69:27)
dreadnought fights are the first (69:25 - 69:28)
previews of what your team fights should (69:27 - 69:29)
be (69:28 - 69:32)
zapdos doesn't feel that weird yeah yeah (69:29 - 69:33)
i feel like (69:32 - 69:36)
because teams are rotating down to (69:33 - 69:38)
dreadnaught twice a match (69:36 - 69:42)
and it doesn't feel like zapdos is that (69:38 - 69:44)
weird versus the first two weeks where (69:42 - 69:45)
no one was going to dreadnough and no (69:44 - 69:47)
one was like leaving and then (69:45 - 69:48)
you (69:47 - 69:51)
because you know we we joked about how (69:48 - 69:52)
you know greg and i would play together (69:51 - 69:54)
and i wouldn't see greg until the last (69:52 - 69:56)
minutes of the match so like they open (69:54 - 69:59)
up lane i don't know how what i don't (69:56 - 70:00)
know what greg's doing i don't know (69:59 - 70:02)
what's happening down there i have no (70:00 - 70:03)
clue but now that the (70:02 - 70:07)
the game is like okay at seven minutes (70:03 - 70:09)
everyone is moving to dreadnought maybe (70:07 - 70:12)
one person stays behind um (70:09 - 70:14)
like i get to see greg more often right (70:12 - 70:16)
i'm like oh you're down here you're (70:14 - 70:17)
doing things cool (70:16 - 70:20)
um and you can evaluate the situation (70:17 - 70:21)
when you get down there like did their (70:20 - 70:25)
team move down yeah how like (70:21 - 70:28)
how is it a disaster down here what what (70:25 - 70:29)
why are there orbs everywhere it's (70:28 - 70:31)
interesting because (70:29 - 70:33)
player i think players have become more (70:31 - 70:35)
aggressive because of that and like i (70:33 - 70:37)
had to stop using pollen puff (70:35 - 70:39)
because (70:37 - 70:41)
leaf tornado with it's speeding up your (70:39 - 70:42)
uh (70:41 - 70:44)
your allies attacks while they're in (70:42 - 70:45)
that stream (70:44 - 70:47)
is (70:45 - 70:49)
a better support option for me than the (70:47 - 70:51)
passive healing i would get from pollen (70:49 - 70:53)
puff that's on a longer (70:51 - 70:54)
cooldown (70:53 - 70:56)
or it's a slightly slower kill down but (70:54 - 70:59)
like the healing takes a while before it (70:56 - 71:00)
goes off (70:59 - 71:01)
so (71:00 - 71:03)
in this in the as the game has (71:01 - 71:04)
progressed it (71:03 - 71:07)
players have gotten more aggressive for (71:04 - 71:09)
those team fights and things like pollen (71:07 - 71:12)
puff that are more passive just aren't (71:09 - 71:13)
worth it and i've had to switch my (71:12 - 71:15)
playstyle to say okay (71:13 - 71:17)
playing goss i need leaf turning to way (71:15 - 71:18)
more often because i need to be doing (71:17 - 71:21)
that damage and giving that speed (71:18 - 71:23)
advantage and attacks to my team because (71:21 - 71:27)
it is so aggressive right now yeah and (71:23 - 71:30)
the thing the thing about zapdos is (71:27 - 71:32)
it felt like the first week or two (71:30 - 71:35)
everyone was trying to take zapdos right (71:32 - 71:37)
and then the the meta change where if (71:35 - 71:40)
the game goes you're in the lee or a (71:37 - 71:43)
huge lead then if you're the huge lead (71:40 - 71:44)
you go (71:43 - 71:46)
oh we we don't attack them we don't (71:44 - 71:48)
attack zapdos we keep them from getting (71:46 - 71:51)
disaster and now now the what i feel the (71:48 - 71:54)
like meta is is if you're a huge lead (71:51 - 71:56)
and you're like cool let's all go to (71:54 - 71:59)
zapdos and defend the team goes (71:56 - 72:00)
oh we're just going to go to your bases (71:59 - 72:03)
because we know you're going to zapdos (72:00 - 72:05)
yeah we're going to dunk but like there (72:03 - 72:06)
is (72:05 - 72:09)
so many things happening at zapdos that (72:06 - 72:11)
doesn't even include zapdos at this (72:09 - 72:12)
point right (72:11 - 72:14)
the game and so (72:12 - 72:17)
i still stand by i don't think zapdos (72:14 - 72:19)
is a bad mechanic (72:17 - 72:21)
i think that people just didn't (72:19 - 72:23)
understand (72:21 - 72:25)
or were like super salty it's like well (72:23 - 72:28)
we were winning the entire game and then (72:25 - 72:30)
uh we lost zapdos so it sucks that we (72:28 - 72:32)
were winning for eight minutes and we (72:30 - 72:34)
lost and it's like okay you can defend (72:32 - 72:37)
you can take you can split your team to (72:34 - 72:39)
go to their bases and ignore zapdos and (72:37 - 72:41)
force them to like (72:39 - 72:43)
retreat like there there are so many (72:41 - 72:46)
options you have and (72:43 - 72:46)
and the dreadnaught battles i think (72:47 - 72:53)
really lay out what your final game plan (72:50 - 72:55)
should be which i think makes zapdos a (72:53 - 72:58)
stronger mechanic of like (72:55 - 72:59)
how are (72:58 - 73:02)
like dreadnought is mini zapdos (72:59 - 73:04)
yeah and how how are those battles going (73:02 - 73:07)
how you can see how your team functions (73:04 - 73:08)
at that point you can see how their team (73:07 - 73:10)
functions at that point and then you (73:08 - 73:11)
could just have a match where we we (73:10 - 73:14)
literally spent eight minutes fighting (73:11 - 73:15)
dreadnaught (73:14 - 73:17)
fred not showed up (73:15 - 73:19)
and we sat down there the entire time (73:17 - 73:21)
and literally until dreadnought (73:19 - 73:23)
despawned and zapdos popped up and was (73:21 - 73:25)
like oh nothing got like what is this (73:23 - 73:28)
match right now yeah that gets them wild (73:25 - 73:30)
there's some wild matches yeah yeah yeah (73:28 - 73:33)
uh i all in all i i it's good i like it (73:30 - 73:35)
a lot it's first it's frustrating (73:33 - 73:38)
because yeah it's teamwork but i i i (73:35 - 73:42)
just i just need to find (73:38 - 73:42)
a team to to just like re-level set my (73:42 - 73:48)
enjoyment of the game (73:47 - 73:52)
uh and sort of like help me deal with (73:48 - 73:54)
the sort of internal frustrations of (73:52 - 73:59)
dealing with with random players (73:54 - 73:59)
question of the week uh oh yeah hold on (74:03 - 74:08)
question of the week what is the (74:09 - 74:15)
question of the week (74:11 - 74:16)
that's mario (74:15 - 74:18)
[Laughter] (74:16 - 74:20)
what you need one of those little pitch (74:18 - 74:23)
pipes to like oh yeah (74:20 - 74:25)
i do but (74:23 - 74:27)
that's me like a lot i mean i have to (74:25 - 74:29)
dig up my old one (74:27 - 74:31)
oh this is good (74:29 - 74:34)
this is from miles from our uh patreon (74:31 - 74:36)
slack (74:34 - 74:38)
what fantasy creature that currently (74:36 - 74:40)
does not have a pokemon counterpart (74:38 - 74:42)
would you like to see added in the next (74:40 - 74:44)
gen (74:42 - 74:44)
well where is the next gen (74:45 - 74:49)
yeah (74:47 - 74:51)
um (74:49 - 74:54)
as i say unicorn we got rapidash (74:51 - 74:55)
uh i'm trying to think of fantasy (74:54 - 74:57)
creatures that aren't in the game i know (74:55 - 74:59)
it's kind of like (74:57 - 75:02)
we really got to stretch (74:59 - 75:04)
do we don't really have like a mermaid (75:02 - 75:05)
that's the first thing that came to my (75:04 - 75:07)
mind (75:05 - 75:09)
oh yeah (75:07 - 75:12)
that's true that's true (75:09 - 75:14)
i was thinking of more of a humanoid (75:12 - 75:17)
mermaid like a mr mime slash jinx (75:14 - 75:19)
situation but yeah maybe that's for the (75:17 - 75:21)
better obviously we don't have it (75:19 - 75:24)
we got impedimp we don't have pegasus (75:21 - 75:26)
but we have tropius (75:24 - 75:28)
uh we don't have a pegasus that would be (75:26 - 75:29)
pretty cool (75:28 - 75:31)
did you say tropius was close to a (75:29 - 75:32)
pegasus (75:31 - 75:36)
it is a large winged flying (75:32 - 75:39)
forklift creature yes i don't know (75:36 - 75:42)

uh (75:46 - 75:49)
manticore i can see a manticore working (75:52 - 75:56)
i don't think we have a manticore so a (75:54 - 75:59)
manticore has a line for the lion for (75:56 - 76:01)
the for a head (75:59 - 76:03)
has wings and then it has a scorpion (76:01 - 76:05)

i like how you knew it we got there (78:55 - 78:59)
together though we eventually got when i (78:57 - 79:02)
realized you were referencing (78:59 - 79:04)
hercules the disney movie yeah yeah yeah (79:02 - 79:07)
because you're like a man in hercus i (79:04 - 79:08)
was first thinking hercules the tv (79:07 - 79:10)
series i'm like i'm pretty sure you've (79:08 - 79:12)
never seen that and also you don't like (79:10 - 79:14)
disney so i was like which hercules are (79:12 - 79:16)
you pulling from we gotta we got what (79:14 - 79:20)
about xena warrior princess (79:16 - 79:20)
yeah she should just be in the man i (79:21 - 79:26)
spent so much of the 90s saying exactly (79:23 - 79:28)
that sentence because i was a huge xena (79:26 - 79:29)
fan (79:28 - 79:32)
i was a huge fan uh there isn't really a (79:29 - 79:35)
two-legged goat man in the game (79:32 - 79:37)
pokemon (79:35 - 79:39)
i mean the humanoid ones we kind of want (79:37 - 79:40)
to avoid (79:39 - 79:41)
i mean (79:40 - 79:44)
grumpy ain't doing anyone favors (79:41 - 79:48)
no what's the horse with the eagle head (79:44 - 79:51)
uh oh oh oh griffin griffin could do a (79:48 - 79:53)
griffin yeah we could do a griffin i (79:51 - 79:56)
could do it for a griffin (79:53 - 80:00)
we did quetzalcoatl we got that already (79:56 - 80:03)
um (80:00 - 80:03)
that's it i'm sticking with manticore (80:03 - 80:08)
okay i'm sticking with pig man goat (80:05 - 80:11)
air man pig bear meant pig ah this is (80:08 - 80:13)
from our youtube if you would like to (80:11 - 80:15)

comment in our youtube on the newest (80:15 - 80:18)
episode and we'll try to get to it this (80:16 - 80:20)
is from void of sin (80:18 - 80:22)
also i don't know hit the like button (80:20 - 80:23)
and the subscribe hit the like and (80:22 - 80:27)
subscribe subscribe and like uh (80:23 - 80:28)
i don't know if we're doing it but what (80:27 - 80:31)
is your ideal for gen 9 i would love a (80:28 - 80:33)
new pokedex like gen 5 had it was super (80:31 - 80:35)
exciting to play for the first time you (80:33 - 80:37)
never know what you're going to find (80:35 - 80:38)
next (80:37 - 80:41)
well people certainly hate that yeah so (80:38 - 80:44)
i mean so what do it what do i want i (80:41 - 80:46)
feel like that would be a good gen 10 (80:44 - 80:48)
thing like every five years you do a (80:46 - 80:51)
fresh pokedex and force people to (80:48 - 80:53)
i i mean i would like (80:51 - 80:57)
gen 9 to be set in either brazil or (80:53 - 80:59)
australia (80:57 - 81:01)
yay i was gonna say egypt (80:59 - 81:04)
no egypt i feel like egypt is a is a (81:01 - 81:06)
good ten because it's got a lot of (81:04 - 81:08)
mediterranean and you can pull on kalos (81:06 - 81:10)
and you can pull on other things (81:08 - 81:13)
and like there's a lot around that area (81:10 - 81:14)
so that feels like a ten thing to me (81:13 - 81:17)
yeah i feel like an isolated island like (81:14 - 81:18)
australia where nobody knows what's (81:17 - 81:21)
happening there it's like a giant (81:18 - 81:23)
mystery and most of that land is trying (81:21 - 81:24)
to kill you (81:23 - 81:27)
makes a great very dangerous pokemon (81:24 - 81:29)
very dangerous pokemon like you cannot (81:27 - 81:31)
there were sharks (81:29 - 81:33)
in the flooded streets at one point (81:31 - 81:36)
every spider is deadly every person is (81:33 - 81:39)
potentially deadly it is a wild frontier (81:36 - 81:42)
and is a good for gennady so (81:39 - 81:45)
when i was at the grocery store today i (81:42 - 81:46)
obviously was trying to catch shiny (81:45 - 81:48)
eevees so i had my pokeball plus (81:46 - 81:51)
attached to my belt and i literally had (81:48 - 81:52)
this thought i was like (81:51 - 81:55)
they should make a pokemon game where (81:52 - 81:58)
the pokemon trainers (81:55 - 82:02)
are more like pokemon players in (81:58 - 82:04)
today's day and age in the real world (82:02 - 82:05)
where it's like they're not the most (82:04 - 82:08)
popular people (82:05 - 82:10)
right maybe they're slightly looked down (82:08 - 82:12)
on by society and you have to prove your (82:10 - 82:14)
worth (82:12 - 82:15)
um and like (82:14 - 82:17)
you know prove how cool you are because (82:15 - 82:19)
you're a pokemon trainer it's not just (82:17 - 82:21)
like oh you train pokemon you're a great (82:19 - 82:24)
cool dude we live in a society where (82:21 - 82:27)
being a pokemon trainer is not so cool (82:24 - 82:29)
and then you have to like work around (82:27 - 82:32)
that as part of the story (82:29 - 82:32)
i mean i could also see them going back (82:34 - 82:37)
to (82:36 - 82:40)
japan (82:37 - 82:40)
i mean like (82:40 - 82:44)
actually with a given market they need (82:42 - 82:46)
to go to china (82:44 - 82:47)
yeah (82:46 - 82:49)
uh yeah there's more money there than (82:47 - 82:50)
anywhere else (82:49 - 82:54)
uh but also like you know unova was just (82:50 - 82:56)
new york and the surrounding areas like (82:54 - 82:57)
it wasn't all the united states alola (82:56 - 83:00)
was just hawaii a huge desert in the (82:57 - 83:03)
middle of new york it's amazing yeah (83:00 - 83:06)
um like kalos was just (83:03 - 83:08)
technically france like it wasn't so (83:06 - 83:10)
sorry paris it wasn't like all of france (83:08 - 83:12)
well i guess maybe (83:10 - 83:14)
so i mean there are a bunch of things (83:12 - 83:16)
like the the palace is clearly a nod to (83:14 - 83:19)
versailles like there's a bunch around (83:16 - 83:22)
paris and the surrounding regions yeah (83:19 - 83:23)
so (83:22 - 83:26)
like as much as i would like australia (83:23 - 83:28)
would they do all of australia or would (83:26 - 83:31)
they do like one coast oh cut off perth (83:28 - 83:34)
dude like nobody else is just the (83:31 - 83:36)
stretch between sydney and melbourne the (83:34 - 83:38)
only two areas that people actually live (83:36 - 83:40)
in oh now all of our brisbane listeners (83:38 - 83:43)
have just dropped (83:40 - 83:46)
because nobody lives in perth (83:43 - 83:47)
i (83:46 - 83:49)
everybody who has sent emails saying i'm (83:47 - 83:52)
from perth has spoofed they're spoofers (83:49 - 83:53)
they really live no i mean i believe in (83:52 - 83:56)
perth it's just it's kind of like (83:53 - 83:59)
[Laughter] (83:56 - 84:01)

you know you've got the sydney opera (84:25 - 84:30)
house you've got zach perna in melbourne (84:27 - 84:36)
[Laughter] (84:30 - 84:38)
i'm typing in (84:36 - 84:39)
what's (84:38 - 84:42)
famous who's closest to the rock in (84:39 - 84:44)
perth (84:42 - 84:45)
i know you're not supposed to call it (84:44 - 84:47)
ears rock anymore but (84:45 - 84:49)
it's uh (84:47 - 84:51)
is that close to perth or where is that (84:49 - 84:53)
apparently there's a zoo in perth i mean (84:51 - 84:55)
there's a zoo it's outside my window (84:53 - 84:58)
most days (84:55 - 85:01)
frogs man (84:58 - 85:01)
well pokemon of the week all right last (85:01 - 85:07)
week's pokemon uh the key references (85:04 - 85:09)
were that you had you couldn't encounter (85:07 - 85:10)
it in the old days until you had passed (85:09 - 85:14)
through route 102 (85:10 - 85:16)
it has a split evolution (85:14 - 85:18)
in pokemon unite it only involves into (85:16 - 85:20)
one of those because there's no dawn (85:18 - 85:21)
zone (85:20 - 85:23)
uh and (85:21 - 85:25)
for one of its evolutions it can be (85:23 - 85:27)
either male or female but the other (85:25 - 85:31)
evolution is male only but they both (85:27 - 85:35)
have the final evolutions have megas (85:31 - 85:37)
uh i thought that that was enough but i (85:35 - 85:38)
also said mentioned that it has a (85:37 - 85:40)
pre-evolution so if you were thinking of (85:38 - 85:43)
the first one that's not it it's the one (85:40 - 85:46)
in the middle (85:43 - 85:46)
it's (85:46 - 85:49)
munchlax (85:51 - 85:56)
a pre-evolution (85:54 - 85:56)
there's nothing before a munchlax (85:57 - 86:01)
it's (85:59 - 86:02)
girlia (86:01 - 86:05)
pearlia (86:02 - 86:09)
how do you say that one get out the 3ds (86:05 - 86:11)
yeah what's the correct pronunciation (86:09 - 86:14)
for curlia uh (86:11 - 86:14)
it's dead (86:14 - 86:17)
it has been powerful (86:15 - 86:20)
[Laughter] (86:17 - 86:22)
i think it's corelia though i think it's (86:20 - 86:24)
girlia do you guys know what curly in (86:22 - 86:26)
photography is (86:24 - 86:30)
no okay so that's where you take a piece (86:26 - 86:32)
of living material and you put it on a (86:30 - 86:34)
photo plate (86:32 - 86:35)
and you (86:34 - 86:37)
do an electrical charge through the (86:35 - 86:39)
photo plate and it oh it makes like an (86:37 - 86:43)
aura around the pieces oh yeah (86:39 - 86:44)
no no (86:43 - 86:47)
that's familiar uh shuffle shuffle icon (86:44 - 86:48)
is (86:47 - 86:51)
awesome but the shiny i (86:48 - 86:53)
am such a fan of this line anyways and (86:51 - 86:56)
the shiny line is so good (86:53 - 86:57)
it's very good (86:56 - 86:58)
so good (86:57 - 87:00)
there was uh (86:58 - 87:02)
back in the day our listeners probably (87:00 - 87:04)
remember travis they were on way too (87:02 - 87:06)
many episodes (87:04 - 87:08)
love them to death they're very happy to (87:06 - 87:09)
be on too many i've been on more than (87:08 - 87:10)
them (87:09 - 87:12)
well at one point they were on longer (87:10 - 87:15)
than anyone else besides me that's true (87:12 - 87:17)
and i (87:15 - 87:20)
the the gardevoir line has always (87:17 - 87:22)
stood out to me because (87:20 - 87:24)
they always made a big deal with the (87:22 - 87:26)
fairy (87:24 - 87:28)
split at the time (87:26 - 87:29)
uh (87:28 - 87:31)
because they were upset (87:29 - 87:33)
that you know their favorite psychic i (87:31 - 87:36)
think i think it was just pure psychics (87:33 - 87:38)
correct yes and then it was like well (87:36 - 87:40)
they were not big on fairy and then they (87:38 - 87:42)
added fairy to their pokemon (87:40 - 87:44)
and i i get in retrospect like i get it (87:42 - 87:46)
you know you're changing a pokemon that (87:44 - 87:49)
somebody really likes but (87:46 - 87:51)
uh travis ended up really liking the (87:49 - 87:54)
fairy after the fact but (87:51 - 87:56)
it was a lot of commotion back in the (87:54 - 87:58)
day before gen 6 where we were arguing (87:56 - 88:00)
whether fairy was good or if it was the (87:58 - 88:01)
right thing (88:00 - 88:02)
um (88:01 - 88:05)
so that this line has always reminded me (88:02 - 88:06)
of them which (88:05 - 88:08)
is i'm i'm (88:06 - 88:11)
very team fairy fyi just so oh yeah i (88:08 - 88:13)
love (88:11 - 88:13)
uh there's a fairy (88:13 - 88:14)
travis throw back for our listeners that (88:14 - 88:20)
remember i mean like they didn't die (88:17 - 88:20)
i mean they moved to canada they may (88:21 - 88:25)
have died that's true you can still hear (88:23 - 88:28)
wheels a lot on my show so (88:25 - 88:30)
um (88:28 - 88:32)
corelia shares the category with mess (88:30 - 88:34)
spirit and indeedy they are all known as (88:32 - 88:37)
the emotion pokemon (88:34 - 88:39)
i think i also mentioned that curlia's (88:37 - 88:41)
number in the cinno pokedex platinum (88:39 - 88:43)
only and (88:41 - 88:47)
uh el mia bowser are the same (88:43 - 88:50)
what is this browser that's the (88:47 - 88:52)
that's oh the (88:50 - 88:54)
the yeah okay (88:52 - 88:57)
yeah (88:54 - 88:57)
can we please get a pokemon ranger game (88:58 - 89:01)

in both the (89:08 - 89:13)
amorphous and the human-like egg groups (89:10 - 89:16)
amorphous there's no i (89:13 - 89:18)
oh i was thinking matrix (89:16 - 89:20)
you know irene has never seen the matrix (89:18 - 89:22)
well good she's better off for that good (89:20 - 89:26)
good for her good life choices irene (89:22 - 89:28)
well done (89:26 - 89:29)
we were watching a documentary about (89:28 - 89:32)
woodstock 99 (89:29 - 89:35)
and they brought up them (89:32 - 89:35)
wow (89:36 - 89:38)
that was a very documentary about i had (89:37 - 89:41)
to live through that yeah why it was a (89:38 - 89:44)
very good documentary it was on hbo max (89:41 - 89:45)
uh it just came out like a month ago so (89:44 - 89:47)
it's like no fire festival (89:45 - 89:51)
it made fire festivals seem like a (89:47 - 89:54)
real palace (89:51 - 89:54)
i didn't (89:55 - 89:58)
sometimes you don't realize how much of (89:56 - 89:59)
a mess something is until somebody lays (89:58 - 90:02)
it all out for yeah (89:59 - 90:04)
that (90:02 - 90:04)
it also that documentary also just (90:04 - 90:08)
reminded me of how (90:06 - 90:10)
lousy (90:08 - 90:13)
the late 90s early 2000s were it was (90:10 - 90:14)
awful (90:13 - 90:15)
look (90:14 - 90:18)
when you look back (90:15 - 90:21)
on any decade and you're like (90:18 - 90:22)
yeah there was a lot that was real (90:21 - 90:24)
messed up we were just getting through (90:22 - 90:25)
it at the time (90:24 - 90:27)
i'm surprised we did i think the thing (90:25 - 90:30)
that stood out to me that they said is (90:27 - 90:34)
everyone in 1999 wanted to be mad at (90:30 - 90:37)
something but there wasn't really (90:34 - 90:40)
a reason to be mad (90:37 - 90:41)
and i was like you're right there wasn't (90:40 - 90:43)
really a reason to be there was a reason (90:41 - 90:45)
to be mad all these computer programmers (90:43 - 90:47)
had used shortcuts and now we were going (90:45 - 90:49)
to have the millennium bug and we were (90:47 - 90:51)
all going to die because of lazy (90:49 - 90:53)
computer programmers (90:51 - 90:55)
wait till i tell you about the energy (90:53 - 90:58)
crisis of the 70s it'll blow your mind (90:55 - 90:59)
do you think people listening to the (90:58 - 91:01)
show (90:59 - 91:02)
i would hope most of our listeners know (91:01 - 91:05)
what y2k was right (91:02 - 91:08)
uh no no no (91:05 - 91:08)
no (91:08 - 91:10)
no (91:08 - 91:11)
i mean what a (91:10 - 91:13)
given so the average age of your (91:11 - 91:15)
listeners is what like (91:13 - 91:17)
25 so (91:15 - 91:19)
they were children (91:17 - 91:21)
i was a child i was 12 years old i (91:19 - 91:24)
remember difference between 4 and 12. (91:21 - 91:27)
you were almost a teenager (91:24 - 91:29)
they were (91:27 - 91:32)
children like young children who didn't (91:29 - 91:33)
have to deal with it (91:32 - 91:34)
at all (91:33 - 91:37)
if it was very uneventful it was also (91:34 - 91:39)
incredibly uneventful it was a thing (91:37 - 91:42)
that that we were all panicking about in (91:39 - 91:45)
every business in the world had to go (91:42 - 91:45)
through (91:45 - 91:47)
because i was there (91:45 - 91:50)
a scramble to check every line of code (91:47 - 91:52)
to make sure that when it flipped over (91:50 - 91:55)
it didn't break like for people who were (91:52 - 91:59)
adults that that entire time period was (91:55 - 92:01)
awful because if you worked with (91:59 - 92:03)
anything with a computer if you had (92:01 - 92:04)
anything that had a computer chip in it (92:03 - 92:07)
you had to deal with everybody coming at (92:04 - 92:09)
you to check it is it going to work what (92:07 - 92:11)
are you going to do and then you had (92:09 - 92:13)
people who are like (92:11 - 92:15)
my toaster has a computer chip in it and (92:13 - 92:17)
it's not going to give me toast tomorrow (92:15 - 92:18)
and like (92:17 - 92:21)
the com the conspiracy theories all you (92:18 - 92:24)
kids were spared from that a lot of you (92:21 - 92:25)
teens were spared from it those of us in (92:24 - 92:27)
the working (92:25 - 92:29)
corporations (92:27 - 92:32)
1999 was a terrible territory also of (92:29 - 92:34)
being of the age of understanding where (92:32 - 92:35)
it's like (92:34 - 92:36)
people (92:35 - 92:39)
were honestly like not only was my (92:36 - 92:40)
toaster not going to make toast it's (92:39 - 92:43)
going to explode in my house (92:40 - 92:45)
my refrigerator is going to explode (92:43 - 92:47)
because it can't handle the change in (92:45 - 92:49)
the year planes are going to drop out of (92:47 - 92:51)
the sky (92:49 - 92:52)
because they can't handle this also (92:51 - 92:55)
there was uh is gonna lock up all my (92:52 - 92:56)
bank accounts and i'll have no money i (92:55 - 92:59)
have no money i'll have no money all my (92:56 - 93:00)
bank accounts will lock up and it and (92:59 - 93:02)
since everything's on computers it will (93:00 - 93:03)
drain them all (93:02 - 93:04)
like (93:03 - 93:06)
there was a lot of fear-mongering around (93:04 - 93:09)
it and some of it was true like these (93:06 - 93:11)
things (93:09 - 93:13)
could have happened but the amount of (93:11 - 93:15)
work that we had to do that year of (93:13 - 93:16)
trying to check (93:15 - 93:17)
literally every (93:16 - 93:19)
line of code that ever existed (93:17 - 93:20)
was (93:19 - 93:21)
awful (93:20 - 93:23)
and then they decided to have another (93:21 - 93:25)
woodstock (93:23 - 93:25)
for reasons well but the thing about (93:26 - 93:30)
that getting back to the source here (93:29 - 93:32)
which we haven't even gotten to the real (93:30 - 93:33)
pokemon of the week (93:32 - 93:34)
is (93:33 - 93:37)
that the previous woodstock the 25th (93:34 - 93:40)
anniversary one was really good (93:37 - 93:42)
oh 94. yeah (93:40 - 93:44)
yeah it was a really good one it was (93:42 - 93:46)
like five years later let's destroy the (93:44 - 93:49)
concept this makes like the worst (93:46 - 93:52)
experience possible (93:49 - 93:52)
all right here we go (93:53 - 93:57)
this week's pokemon i may have gotten (93:55 - 93:58)
this wrong so (93:57 - 94:00)
good luck (93:58 - 94:02)
if we get this correct or not the clue (94:00 - 94:03)
was actually the us talking about (94:02 - 94:06)
woodstock (94:03 - 94:06)
the pokemon of the week is (94:06 - 94:09)
snoopy's (94:08 - 94:11)
[Laughter] (94:09 - 94:12)
did you know woodstock actually didn't (94:11 - 94:15)
even happen in woodstock new york i've (94:12 - 94:18)
been to woodstock new york either way (94:15 - 94:19)
in the pokemon games that brought us (94:18 - 94:22)
such standout pokemon like xionatic and (94:19 - 94:25)
steeny there are also some pokemon that (94:22 - 94:27)
are quickly and easily forgotten (94:25 - 94:30)
this can get a bit tricky so pay close (94:27 - 94:32)
