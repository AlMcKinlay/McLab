[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 270 fourth episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I am your host s BJ and with me today on this Thursday night when we're recording so hopefully no news comes out this weekend is will yeah that's real scary cuz something real bigs gonna drop this weekend and did you know half of 274 is 137 I didn't a little-known fact yeah so we're recording early because I'm gonna be gone all weekend I get back on Sunday night I'm just going to Minnesota for Irene's family so hopefully nothing drastic or event worthy happens Pokemon news wise over the weekend but I can't imagine so but who knows recording on Thursday night instead of Sunday morning it is myself its will no Travis they are off working the job working the one that pays them with the money the man has them working Oh the man's got us all down I probably would have asked Mycah to be on but I think he's probably exhausted from all the recording and prep work we had to do this week plus all that gourmet cooking that he does all the beautiful meals so if you're a new listener to it's super effective welcome this is a Pokemon podcast I'm gonna do a little bit of housecleaning before we jump in but besides the housecleaning that we're gonna do right off the bat we have some Pokemon news regarding Pokemon God regarding this really weird unknown video that was shown and about xx the Pokemon movie then we got some emails and then we got a Pokemon of the week which we are revamping based on some feedback from our slack community so our Pokemon of the week is gonna be a little bit different really different this time just because there's no Travis I'll fill in the void they're a little bit different Pokemon of the week so stay tuned for that it will be neato King this week probably should start announcing the POC run of the week early I don't know why it's never a secret because it's in the show notes which leads into our housecleaning if you're a new listener or your current listener normally the the first couple minutes of the episode is usually off-topic stuff like what happened in the week that's not Pokemon related and I think that's very important to our show not only because the majority of our listeners liked that segment the best but I think it really does showcase our personalities if you're listening to this most of this Pokemon news you've probably already heard through Twitter or on video game websites or bubble pedia or Sarah B or you know wherever you get news I've always said that most people listening the show don't come to get breaking news they just come to get our opinions on the news that just happens to be a little bit late yeah snarky sassy attitude with your news that's what you get here but the last couple episodes I think the last five or six episodes there are more detailed show notes so if there's a certain segment you don't like to listen to let's say you don't care about Pokemon go let's say you don't care about the Pokemon TCG which we we talk about from time to time maybe you don't like Pokemon of the week you can look at the show notes now and see exactly one segment start and new segments begin so if Pokemon of the week is at you know an hour twenty minutes and housecleaning starts at an hour thirty minutes you know that Pokemon weeks ten minutes long and if that's something you don't care about you could easily skip over that so just that's just for people who have been listening for a long time and or new people that the show notes are more detailed so if that's something you like cool if not you know just continue listening as always well some more housecleaning so the reason Mike is not on and because I said that he's probably exhausted is because we just launched a new podcast together did you really we did I think I completely missed that yeah I know you're you're you haven't well you know I'm lying yeah I was the first person to love it we launched a monster hunter podcast this is something that I've wanted to do for for quite a long time I'm a huge huge monster hunter fan and I probably talk slash read about Monster Hunter more than I actually play it which kind of how Pokemon is for me I podcast and and read about Pokemon more than I then I get to play it Mike and I've wanted a podcast for awhile it's it's really convenient that we live very close to each other I I have so much audio gear and so much audio setup that it's appealing to be able to sit in a room with people or in this case one other person podcast together I know I wanted to I knew I wanted to do a Monster Hunter podcast and I knew that the last couple months wasn't the right time to do that I don't even I wouldn't even say that when generations launched last fall I wouldn't even say that that was the right time to do it and I kind of missed the boat when if master hundred for you was was hot but now with Monster Hunter world coming out early 2018 and with it being on ps4 and PC and Xbox one I think it's a really great time to start building that community of hunters and both Myka and I plan to import double cross which is a the expansion quote-unquote expansion two generations except it will only be you it will only be in Japanese so we'll have to finagle through that but with double cross coming out next month and the big game Monster Hunter 5 aka Monster Hunter world coming out early 2018 I think I think it's a perfect opportunity to start building that community and being able to be a resource to welcome new hunters or know new people that are interested in Monster Hunter and so there are three episodes out in iTunes and SoundCloud and stitcher and pocket cast and wherever in Google Play and wherever you get podcasts and so the the name of the show is called the carve you can easily find it on any of those cert services by searching the carve or by searching Monster Hunter it should show up or by searching super-effective FM so those are that's out there for you and if you enjoy Monster Hunter I hope you enjoyed this podcast and if you don't enjoy Monster Hunter well then uh thanks for sitting through two minutes of me telling you about it now it's a good podcast even if you like have played monster hunter before because it's kind of just talking about like what does monster hunter mean to me and what has that his not to me because I wasn't invited to be part of this even though I play monster hunter every single day but like about the history of Monster Hunter so far and like what versions there have been and where they've been and like I like Micah's heartwarming stories about him and his brother and it's about family and love and killing things and chopping them up and using their parts to make armor and weapons I'm I am sure there will be an opportunity for for will to be on when I was originally like I said earlier I think there there is a different kind of dynamic and a different feel when two people are sitting in the same room I suppose to what we do here it's a perfective which three of us are in different states recording and not seeing each other and and I think I do a pretty good job of making that show or the show sound sound alright and feel good and apparently you guys like it that's why you're here but I just wanted to take a moment and talk about Monster Hunter and to everyone who has downloaded and listened to it thank you so much I can't kinda it's it's weird going from like zero like a zero base of like okay we have no episodes we have this brand new Twitter we have we don't have a website yet and I'm working on that and kind of building that up and starting all over again because at the end of the month it's super effective will be seven years old seven years old seven does that mean seven years old I was in my 30s from when you started old man will over here let's jump into some Pokemon news first bit of news will you're going to Pokemon go fast this is very true I am going to I mean I don't want to say it again but but you know what I'm gonna Chicago - Pokemon go fast haha that's bad that's bad as is the city of Chicago but I will make the sacrifice of going there once again to celebrate Pokemon go fast as I speculated earlier my sister no longer wandered her ticket so it was either sell the ticket for I don't even know how much they're going for probably still three to four hundred dollars I'm assuming I haven't checked but let's just pretend that they're still going for three to four hundred dollars on eBay or I could give that ticket to you and make no money wait a minute I gave you five hundred dollars for that ticket you don't lied in the pentacle and I can't believe you sold it to me for five hundred dollars when it was only worth three hundred dollars on eBay somebody if somebody asked the I don't know I was going with hey wait for this podcast to get made I'm excited to see you although I haven't seen once last time we saw each other December what's it really that long ago yeah and it's funny cuz like had three weeks after Pokemon go fest we'll be seeing each other again yeah that's real sad too no that's true cuz I usually do like a spring trip to the area and yeah I didn't this year but time has been going by so fast yeah 2017 s been flying by because you're coming to Pokemon go fest you probably care about the Pokemon code news that dropped recently so we'll go over this real quick here this is the press release I got on the antic and the Pokemon company international have unveiled the new details for Pokemon goes global events and real world activities for trainers around the world to participate together Pokemon go fest Chicago will feature a variety of activities for trainers including unique ways for players at the event and across the globe to work together to compete unique challenges and earn special in-game rewards so if you're not going to put more go fest still some rewards for you here still some team work to do on July 22nd so do I need to bring a smartphone to Pokemon go fest you would you know I was thinking what if somebody like me or anyone else let's just say they're from California though like the longest possible distance in the United States to travel from maybe Washington but they've booked a hotel room they booked a flight they fly all the way out to Pokemon go fast they get through the gate with their wristband and their iPhone or their Android device or whatever they're using just completely dies I don't know if I'm more horrified by your story or the fact that you forgot that like Micronesia is part of the United States so I'm thinking cuz I'm an iPhone user that okay what if this happens to me I know that the north of Michigan Avenue Apple store is what 2025 minutes walking distance from Grant Park all right now that only takes me about 15 to 17 minutes you got longer legs now that's true so you walk over there and because I used to work at an Apple Store they're probably gonna make you wait one to two hours to get a new phone but no book your genius appointment before you leave them your phone's dead it's DOA that's right that was arrival is there an AT&T store somewhere nearby there that they're not gonna fix your iPhone I'm just I'm that would be extremely tragic to travel all the way to this one-day only event where you have to depend on a device and not everyone has two phones like you do will well I was actually just gonna ask should I bring some of my extra iPhones for people maybe because that's a question that people ask I've only got like five or six of them I was thinking about bringing my iPad and an iPod touch that I have just lying around just so if my phone did die for any odd reason I could at least use those devices and connect to Wi-Fi and I don't know it just I I am sure out of the 12,000 plus tickets Pokemon go has sold I bet one person will at least one person will have this issue they get two Pokemon go fest and their phone does not work and they don't have another solution there will be people who show up and completely have forgotten their phone at home absolutely I don't know about the Hat okay hey let me continue continue with his press release here in addition to Pokemon go fest Mainers in Europe will have the chance to team up this summer across seven cities during what is called Pokemon go safari zone events they can catch rare Pokemon obtain special rewards and take on powerful raid bosses Pokemon go Fest will take place on Saturday July 22nd in Grant Park located in the heart of downtown Chicago Oh another side note I was supposed to say this in housecleaning but if you are planning on going to Pokemon go fest or you are just in the Chicago area so you don't have tickets but you do want to attend some sort of Pokemon podcast Meetup I am getting a a soft head count for who might be interested in that ideally what I would like to do is book a nearby restaurant and I know there's I know it's it's at Chicago so either everything's expensive or everything's too far away but that's why I need the head count because if we get you know 35 people and the room costs let me do simpler math if we get 30 people in the room costs $600 to reserve you have to spend $600 in food to you know actually reserve that room that comes down to about 20 dollars a person but you're you're spending that money on drinks and food and dessert or whatever so if I get a head count of how many we have that's ideally brings down the cost so again I'm trying to find a restaurant because at least for the people that will be at Pokemon go fest we're gonna be outside all day we're going to probably be eating not so good food that is extremely overpriced and one seven o'clock hits it's going to be a disaster to try to leave that area car wise and so the simplest thing is let's go to a restaurant that is in walking distance let's sit down and get some better cooked food and let's make sure that space is air conditioning and that space is only for us so it's private and so if that ends up costing you know 10 to 15 dollars a person I'd rather have that then let's not have a place to go and stand outside and be hot and sweaty and some of us will be hungry and some of us are not and I'm not saying that if you're coming you have to spend 10 to 15 a person I'm just saying that if I get a head count I can secure a room and then we don't have to worry about that cost yeah agreed and you just reminded me that I know someone who is somewhat influential from Chicago and let me ask that person for some recommendations as well that would be great because the the rooms that Irene have has found it come with with the head count we have we have of about 25 people resort with that say they are they're coming so that comes to about $20 ish but I wasn't big on that restaurant to begin with so anyways this is this is for people in the Chicago area so don't spend too much time on it but if you're interested in coming even if you're not if you're interested in meeting other it's super effective fans and myself and will and Myka and Irene and the community we have just check our Twitter or check our facebook or check slack just fill out the form all I'm asking is an email if you're going to the fest if you're coming to the after party if you're interested in eating or not and I like I said before if you're not interested in eating no big deal and how many people are in your party so if if you are bringing a significant other or a friend we just want to know a rough headcount if you fill out the form and you decide you can't make it it's honestly no big deal again just looking for a rough headcount I and I'll be that will also be in the show notes that link it's just a Google Form and that will also be like like I said on Twitter and stuff so if you could fill that out as soon as possible that'd be great because we have a kind of finalize things the day after or so this episode comes out back to this Pokemon go Fest will take place Saturday in Grant Park located in downtown Chicago throughout the day trainers will be able to participate in three challenge window activities where they must work together to catch certain types of Pokemon in order to well unlock a variety of perks for Pokemon go players around the world trainers outside of Chicago will be able to participate in the festivities by catching as many Pokemon as possible during these challenge windows to extend the duration of bonuses unlocked by the attendees of Pokemon go fest if trainers around the world catch enough Pokemon a mystery challenge will be revealed that Pokemon go fast you two I'm assuming it has to be Mewtwo for the potential to unlock an extra special bonus across the globe which as I'm assuming for everyone else Mewtwo raids but who knows so wait they've got a we've got to unlock some things that they can then extend the unlock something and if they do that well enough it unlocks something for us which we then have to do succeed at which will then unlock for them that's exactly correct this is a huge burden I'm not coming anymore in Europe Pokemon go safari zone events will be hosted at select shopping centers Copenhagen and Prague on August 5th Stockholm and Amsterdam on August 12th and oberhaussen Harris and Barcelona on September 16th Pokemon goes safari zone events will give trainers the opportunity to catch a variety of Pokemon from special Kanto region and Johto region zones including Pokemon ever encountered in Europe you didn't see the image they used kangaskhan was on top of Europe so the obvious one of the obvious Pokemon that would be encountered would be kangaskhan which currently right now is exclusive to the Australian region players will also have a chance to team up with others to take on unique and powerful raid bosses I'm assuming again this is legendary because they used the word unique and powerful I wouldn't consider any of the rates currently unique because they've been around for three weeks now more powerful ah some of them are tough terrain Atari I think is the toughest right now so I've been catching lots of Pokemon doing the best I can to lead up to this Pokemon go fast event but I'm only level 16 am I going to be able to have fun yeah I think so I mean though the minimum rate level is level 5 so you can still raid you can still hit up poka stops I'm sure there will be tons of lers and incense and everything happening there I have no worry that you wouldn't be on the same playing field as other pokemon go players all right I do I have to bring my own lures lures is a word that's spoken with two syllable lures probably bring my lures every time you level up you get more like you get fruity ones like I think when you hit level 20 you get three or four free ooh cuz I usually the way I walk I passed by one okay stop twice in the morning so I usually set a lure there when the first time I pass it in the night pickup the rewards on them an ex pass around mmm I would save your lures for the fest all future lures will now be saved for the fest but that's how I got a growlithe the Pokemon company will also be hosting an annual Pikachu outbreak event in Yokohama Yokohama sorry Japan from August 9th through the 15th where a special Pokemon go experience will take place more details of the event will be revealed soon and that is your Pokemon Go news well no I've got Pokemon Go news I caught a Pikachu with the hat on it at Washington Circle this morning ash hat Pikachu yes I caught one of those at Washington Circle I recommend anybody who's desperate for Pokemon go action just take a walk down Pennsylvania Avenue between the Four Seasons Hotel and the White House you get all the Pokemon go you need there's like thirty gyms and 400 focus tops I'm uh I've heard I've heard on the street by the street I mean the internet that mareep is pretty common in Washington DC and not common really anywhere else but your area I have not seen a single mareep but I have probably caught a thousand not twos it was a there was a Zhou to you on Pennsylvania Avenue this morning and I did catch that as well I like I said I've heard mareep is in your area but I know as of recording this these spawns just changed they did a spawn refresh so if you're you know used to seeing I don't know piggies piggies are gonna be there regardless if you're used to seeing like main keys in your area it's possible that you may now be seeing like Sandshrew or something like that I am now seeing drowsy at my house and I haven't seen drowsy in my house in in like the past eight months I think we have one more podcast before Pokemon go Fest it yes wait no no this is the last known yes so again fill out that form we will be at pokemon go fest we will be there all day fill out the form if you are at least in the Chicago area and you plan on attending the Meetup like I said the meetup will be after seven o'clock because there are these events that are going on throughout the festival so I don't want I don't want to waste your guys's time if you're there not really waste but you know you're there for the event I want you to have the most fun that you can have at the event you should probably talk about the what the unlocks could possibly be no we should talk about whether it's worthwhile for people to stand on the outside of Grant Park and think that they're gonna be able to participate in them that's happening there's something to do with the bracelets that they tie to your trainer ID so I think that matters in in some aspects to the there are the three challenge windows so at Chicago you have 11 to 11:30 12:00 to 12:30 and 3:00 to 3:30 so there are 30-minute challenge windows for Chicago there are six different challenges but I believe for my understanding is you can only unlock one challenge her to the 30 minutes so even though there are six challenges the Chicago players can only unlock three of the six so during those windows you can catch if you catch enough fire pokemon you'll unlock a candy bonus if you catch enough water pokemon you unlock an XP bonus Reddit and Twitter seems to care about this one if you catch the enough grass pokemon you will unlock a Stardust bonus and I have kind of a complain about that but I'll get back to that if you collect enough electric pokemon that is an egg distance bonus I think it's just the more you walk the faster it is the hatch eggs you catch enough rock pokemon ground ground a rock I can't tell with this pixelated some bling it's the worst one it doesn't matter it's the Buddy distance bonus and then if you collect enough normal Pokemon that is an encounter rate bonus which I believe you just get more encounters if I'm not mistaken and then worldwide there's bronze silver and gold if it's bronze that increases the duration of the bonus by 24 hours if it's silver that's 48 hours and if it's gold you unlock the mystery challenge the mystery challenge if that is successful which I have to imagine has to be successful like there's no way that this is going to be a festival Plaza goal where the first two were unreachable oh it very well could be no no no because if this is the summer of legendary and the legendary Pokemon and they haven't done legendary Pokemon yet and they plan to loo do legendary Pokemon here it would make it seem like they want the goal to be obtainable so then you get people talking and you get people excited and clearly they want people to stay until six o'clock since from six to seven the mystery challenge will be available if it's succeeded and then if the Chicago people can succeed at the mystery challenge it would unlock the global reward for everyone which takes place on July 23rd and July 24th again we don't know what that is but going back to the Stardust I just want to complain real quick that all these hardcore Pokemon players on Reddit and Twitter and forums and Facebook they want more Stardust and the reason you would you start us is the level up your Pokemon and the old gym system used to give Stardust and when there's like adventure week or fire a nice week there's Stardust bonuses and the more you give candy to a Pokemon the more Stardust it requires the level of Pokemon my complaint is I get that people want to we're up there Pokemon but by giving everyone more Stardust it's going to stag it nothing changes and what I mean by that is oh now I have you know 40,000 Stardust and I can level up my golem an extra 500 CP yeah but so does your neighbor and so does everyone else playing they get they're all getting more Stardust and you're getting more Stardust and then instead of everyone's pokemon being let's just say everyone's pokemons at 1200 okay then in two days everyone's Pokemon is at 1500 so nothing changes it's just everyone's numbers went up higher and it's the same but it's not everyone it's only the people at Pokemon go fast you get the stardust bonus yeah but then in terms that would apply to everyone you're saying that a rising tide raises all boats right so no boat gets to be better than any other boat exactly and there's nothing you hate more than not being able to win no it's not even about winning it's just I would rather see for me I would I guess I would rather see like an encounter a bonus because that gives me more of a chance to possibly catch pokemon I don't have I would rather see something like an egg distance bonus because if I can go through eggs faster and I'm at the event and they're giving out more eggs and I'm planning on walking all day I think that bonus is really valuable I would rather get a candy bonus because there's a lot of Pokemon I have and the only thing I am missing is candy and I would rather fill out my pokedex at that point but Stardust bonus I have had zero issues taking over a gym if I go to a gym down the street and there it's a valor gym and there's 2,900 Pokemon in there which no one wants 3,000 Seabee Pokemon because of how they are how they work in gyms so if they're at 2999 right before 3000 and they're sitting in gyms there is nothing that is going to stop me from taking that gym solo even though my max Pokemon I think is my train car which is 6,000 2,600 as long as I sit there at that gym I will eventually take it it might take me you know 20 revives and 20 hyper potions but it doesn't like I said last week it doesn't matter if the gym is full of Pokemon at 500 CP or if the gym is at 2,900 CP you can still solo it it's just gonna take you a little longer and if you're with a group if you're with one another person it just goes twice as fast for me to wanna star dust reward to power up Pokemon when CP at this point in the game doesn't matter at all it's just it feels like that is a wasted reward my highest CP Pokemon is 695 and you could do raids just fine with that and you could do gems just fine with that it's a wheezing I don't want to can I give it Stardust to make it better you can but I wouldn't because there's no point like even if you're doing a raid and you have one 600 CP and a bunch of 500 CPS and let's say you're doing a try an ATAR so one of the hardest raids and you're in there with 19 other people you're still as long as Tyranitar is defeated even if you're out if even if all six Pokemon of yours get defeated you are allowed to jump back in with a new six and the raid keeps going the only contest in the raid is the time itself can you beat the timer because even if all six of your Pokemon get knocked out in a raid you just go back in with six more Pokemon if you have a group of people and I was able to do Tyranitar with with me and five other people so six people so if you're level five and all your Pokemon are maybe a hundred CP the other 19 people will get to the end of the raid and you will still get the you'll still get the 3000 cpe the 3000 xp for doing the raid you'll still get the golden raspberries you'll still get the chance at the TM you'll still get the you also get the revised and more importantly you'll still get the chance to catch the train star at the end so again it just validates my point that at this stage of the game CP doesn't really mean a lot the only reason it would mean something is if you want to try to solo those Tyranitar raids or solo those three raids sure I guess you can do that but at that point you're such a small percentage of all the players that it's you're like though you're like the 0.5% of players that want to try to solo a Machamp raid and if you can do it great what if what if I want to battle you battling is not available yet and then talked about this even if battling is available at server side and there's already enough server problems in raids and gyms that what is that battle gonna come down to who can tap faster maybe battling is about competitive dance maybe NCP and CP yeah that's just my thought on the Stardust thing I'm sure that there are people that you know are still gun hole on wanting Stardust but I think the other five rewards besides the buddy distance one I think the other four are more compelling let's talk about that's fine all the rewards can't be great right because if all the rewards were great then they'd actually all be mediocre so you have one bad reward makes all the other ones look good much like this podcast let's talk about the Pokemon mystery files video so this was a video that was posted on the official Japanese Pokemon YouTube account it looks like it was translated here but I think we'll you saw the video I saw the video do you wanna do you want to describe it well so it's like besides the I think it starts with the you known paddle pat panel am I correct in saying that where it's like whatever that that name is the words that are like what if this is real or what does it translate as it's just like it's it's a lot of questions it doesn't open yeah but what does the panel say oh the it demo it ends with the panel yeah well of the YouTube thumbnail is the unknown panel okay so it goes through like scenes from almost every generation of game at least every color generation of games and it has like Celebi and it has deoxys and all kinds of like all the outer-spacey weird and it's got weird music too and it's got like a pyramid shape and yeah it's a bunch of questions like where are these mysterious visitors from and just like it's all questions but no no answers yeah I don't know how to put it and just yet pictures and there's like clefairy is doing a Clefairy dance under the moon and there was that one scene from the pokey star studios which was the UFO movie yeah the invader movie so it's kind of like all the outer Spacey alien Pokemon stuff back although they did not specifically show LGM in BM so hmm that's a little odd to me there i think i'm the website you go to it shows them there's a website yes i have translation here from reddit the questions asked during the it's a two minute and nine second video it's all in Japanese all the questions are in Japanese I don't think there's any there's no one like talking or anything it's just question here's the scene from the Pokemon game question here's a scene from the Pokemon game and like will said starts with generation 1 and then goes all the way to the ultra beast in Sun and Moon the first question is time slip and then it says manipulating time they come from the moon space virus meeting an alien UFO sighting alien invasion the secret side of our world the secret of ancient ruins attack from another world possessing humans that's it assaults us and then it has the pyramid mmm mysterious the video just means nothing well what it means is hey there's a heck of a lot of weird stuff in Pokemon so yeah translate this into English well here's the thing the Pokemon YouTube Japanese channel has a lot of 30-second to three minute videos and most of them are just self-promotion of side games or this the stickers they do or the stamp contest we do like last week when we talked about the 7-eleven stuff where you can go to a 7-eleven and get a stamp and you get two stamps and you get a Pokemon so I did a little research and it looks like this is a teaser trailer for a pokémon fan club series called the mystery files which will come out on July 19th it looks like yes okay before the research some were saying oh that maybe this is something for Ultra Sun and ultra moon and it's possibly giving something ultra beast related but it just seems like it's a pokémon fan club series and those just those just seem to be short mini series that are japan-only kind of like I don't want to like I don't want to sound like I'm discrediting it but I think both you and I have both seen Pokemon Sunday and it's a Pokemon show that happens every Sunday but nothing ever happens during it ya know it's like a variety entertainment show with no plot direction or actual information of value distributed at all that this is along those lines that it's probably something we're not gonna get I think it's cool in the sense that sometimes we forget at least sometimes we like to sometimes we need to be reminded that not all Pokemon in the Pokemon universe are a world from the Pokemon world that Pokemon Keith yeah like D axis and star you and L gum and l GM l GM and BM they're from outer space and that's cool and I guess unknown is from outer space is that what that's referring to I don't know if that I I haven't looked at unknowns dex entry in in a while but I would assume that I don't think so but definitely like clefairy is from the moon I don't think there's much news there besides that but it is a really cool video if you wanted to check that out also more importantly there's a Magnemite video on the pokemon japan youtube channel and it's kind of like the magikarps r where it's just like it's just this Magikarp something but it's like a Magnemite song and it's really cute and it's really great and you should watch that too it's it's real good but I'd say it's a one watcher maybe two times mm-hmm I gave it three times and I still enjoyed it unless you're a really big Magnum a fan then go for it after the video I was kind of a Magnemite last bit of news here wouldn't be a Pokemon podcast without mentioning allegra frank polygon hike starring pokemons next movie reimagines reimagines the first season without Brock and Misty the upcoming 20th pokemon movie I choose you is a reimagining of the animes first season but don't expect everything to be the same Allegra writes among the biggest changes are new takes on classic moments for whatever reason the replacement of ash ketchum best friends Barack and misty I wouldn't go as far as saying best friend Zoe I was just going to say that I mean Missy was just following him around because she wanted to get her honey for her bike right and it was like almost like on did you ever see the movie better off dead mmm-hmm there's this little paperboy and he needs to collect two dollars to pay for the people's like newspaper delivery and he literally just follows the main character around the whole movie and he's like I want my two dollars and that's basically misty in the first season of Pokemon yeah Brock and misty left their posts as gym leaders early in the anime to accompany ash on his journey to becoming a Pokemon master I choose you for fits these characters in favor of two new fellow trainers there is so G whose partner is Lucario a fourth-generation Pokemon and there is Mikado whose buddy is Piplup and Mikado if I'm saying that right is the female I believe that's correct butchering these names both are prominent in the film's promotional materials check out the ex both are prominent in the film's promotional materials the jury is still out whether they're as memorable as the love lord broch and stubborn misty but we imagine that it will be hard to get nostalgic fans to warm up to them count us among the skeptics it's odd to replace Ash's best friend with two best friends with two new comers even if I choose you isn't a straight remake of the original Pokemon anime story this familiar and beloved may be able to withstand some tweaks but dropping some of the most visible characters may not be one of them I choose you premieres in Japan on July 15th a Western date has not been announced correction Lucario is a fourth Jennifer come on not a third gen Pokemon yeah my biggest issue is that Marsha Doe is gonna be in there which is extra extra weird because that's no Lolan dude hi okay this this is this is nothing to do with Allegra she wrote the article I've seen I've seen people complain about Barak and Misty not being in here there's a ton of other sites I could have pulled the same exact article from here's the deal this movie is what 80 to 90 minutes we already have to accept the fact that while the opening of the movie is a reimagining or the opening of the very first couple of episodes of the Pokemon anime there's no way that they're going to be able to tell that's that first season in movie timeline oh oh not the whole first season I can guarantee you there will be no Pikachu with a ketchup bottle guaranteed so you have to write a story that works in 80 to 90 minutes and the Pokemon anime as a full story is what how many episodes over 50 well but the first season would be about 26 episodes was it no when was it when does he get when does he leave for orange islands it's way more than 26 episodes that's not in the first season but still when Brock and Misty and then when he loses boiler when he loses to Richie that's kind of when everything falls apart but Brock and Misty hung out far longer than they should and then they came back well then is it misty that stays with and then Tracy joins and then Brock goes away yeah and then misty goes away and the Brock comes back in okay so here's my other problem is that this is the this it's not a problem here's here's the deal going back to the deal 82 episodes that's a lot of episodes the day the fact that I have so many thoughts okay so the first thought is I love when there's a reimagining of something and I love when when the creator when the producer whoever whoever is in charge of said reimagining product does something different with it if you're going to take the time and resources and you're going to retell a story I am one or that storyteller to make changes and I know that is hotly debated some people want it to be you know pitch perfect to the original some people want it to be dramatic but look if I want to see Ash's journey from start to finish I'll go rewatch the Pokemon anime it's very easily accessible they just redid it in HD it does look significantly better that that they're not taking that away from you but on top of that this is the first movie out of 20 movies where it doesn't fit in the actual Pokemon timeline so the last movie which was McGee erna the marvelous machine or something like that that fit in the timeline between the XY & z anime and the Sun and Moon enemy or wherever it felt it regardless it fit into the timeline this is the first movie to ever go back in time to do something not to mention there's a reason that Brock and misty aren't in this movie and the reason is because Ash never meets them he never actually encounters them when ash seized the ho-oh after the very first episode instead of going to the first gym where he would eventually meet Brock he decides to follow the HOH so he would never meet Brock because he never makes it to p-word city pewter yeah so it's a difference it's a different story altogether because of one fateful change yes they're telling me yes and I think that's really cool so I might actually be interested in seeing it rather than just a an abbreviated rehashing of something I've seen probably about 40 to 50 times already yeah okay let's talk about misty because because ash doesn't make it past the Viridian Forest and I haven't seen the movie it's possible that he goes to the Viridian Forest and he goes to pure at city pewter pewter this movie isn't telling Ash's journey to collect eight badges it's collect it's telling a she's journey of following hoo so misty appears before that but to remind everyone Misty's what you said earlier will know the reason misty exists and the reason that misty sticks around as long as she does it's because she wants money for bike everything does not have to be resolved by the end of the film but still undo so I guess Pikachu's not gonna get attacked by a bunch of heroes or spiros or whatever he got attacked by either it could be and it seems in the trailer that there is there's a Butterfree moment so it seems like ash does CAPTCHA Caterpie again I haven't seen I haven't seen the movie but it looks like they're trying to retell the scene where Ash lets the butter frig go oh it's so sad it's called bye-bye butter free mmm-hmm so that's that's where that's where some of the more complaints come of okay ash goes on the separate journey they split the timeline instead of going to be instead of starting off to go get his badges he instead follows her which he never originally did in the very first episode if he follows ho and along the lines catches a Caterpie involves to a metapod and then at some point decides to release the Butterfree isn't that a story already told ya sure but it in itself is extremely memorable not only does it provide a fanservice to people like you and me well who have have been around the block we've seen the Pokemon anime especially when it originally debuted and we remember that moment of Butterfree but I do think it is an extremely powerful moment that new people should be able to experience because I think that if I was to pick a couple moments out of the thousands of hours hundreds of hours I don't know how many hours there are of the Pokemon anime that is such a strong and powerful moment to tell you that Pokemon are more than just these battling creatures that not only are they used to get badges and to earn money from preschoolers that only use zubats and to help you win championships they're also like your friends and they also represents they also represent moments in time and memories and connections and we joke about it all the time but like fans of this podcast know that I wasted a master ball on a gold a on a gold duck and that that has never lived me down and that's a good story to tell just like Butterfree leaving ash is a good story to tell so why not tell it again it's no ke story to tell it was nothing good story in the annals our canons of literature it's no Ivanhoe it's no Citizen Kane citizen gains not a book so there's my two cents I am I had I I can't remember the last time I've been so excited for a Pokemon movie though I am so excited for this movie that if it does have theatrical release I will fly to Texas to watch it I saw the black and white theatrical and I that was probably that actually that was probably the last time I was excited or a Pokemon movie see I saw that in a theater with with an on Pokemon fan and boy were they unhappy with me that movie was okay it wasn't it wasn't winning any Grammys but it was it was good I certainly hope it wouldn't win any Grammys since those are for music it is the Oscar that is for cinema cinema sometimes you got to try a little harder than that will okay I'll keep that in mind we're gonna take a quick break we I never mentioned this and I should and I feel bad but Nick Burgas Bert Burgess I'm sorry how do you say his last name it's Burgess I said it wrong I think for the first 50 episodes of my own podcast yes Nicholas Burgess does takes time out of out of his week I don't ask for these I don't send him music to do he listens to the show like any other fan if he finds humor and or pleasure in in me not being able to pronounce things and and turns them into remixes and we use them in our show because they're just fantastic and they bring a lot of joy to my Tim to me and so just a shout-out to Nick for doing these remixes again I don't ask for these he does them on their own there they're fantastic so I couldn't stop laughing when I heard the first one so if you're ever curious of where our break music comes from it comes from Nicholas Berg Burgess and he's just a fantastic fantastic musician and he has a couple albums out I know he's will he's working on his third album right now that is correct and I really wish it would come out I cannot yeah I cannot wait to listen to it his his album from 2013 which is just fantastic I listened to it last night when is that album it's the red cover one king of another dimension yes must be because wizard planet is the cover is just all Wizards as it is as it should be so enjoy the break news ik will be back we're gonna do a couple emails and our Pokemon of the week so we will be right back what does the mitterrand supposed to be it's a mix of porcupine I'll rabbit dinosaurs a mouse whales Jackalope probably a horse and hamster porcupine Oh rabbit dinosaurs announced whales Jackalope probably a horseman once a knitter am supposed to be porcupine I'll rabbit dinosaurs a mouse whales Jacqueline probably a in hamster porcupine I'll rabbit dinosaurs a mouse whales Jack Olaf Bob we afford them hamster and we are back from our break and we're gonna do just a couple emails and over behind but I hate doing emails when there's not all three of us or at least three of us all right so first email here is from Daniel writes in and says hi SBJ have been a listener since around episode 100 ish and I'm an active member in the slack community I know this Daniel thank you thank you I am a math teacher math maths oh yeah doesn't doesn't England say maths yeah because they like like because if you were to say the full word it's mathematics Oh since that's plural there like they retain the plural on maths it just sounds awful I'm a math / math teacher whichever you prefer I don't really care despite living in England I started a club a few years ago with the aim of reaching a particular child who had just started with us and was in my house very hairy pottery and I could not believe how many closeted Pokemon players there were and how willing they were to talk and socialise together despite being different ages and from different friendship groups anyways with the help of Pokemon go my club became really popular and I was able to use it as a way to show the functional use of maths looking at probably probability of at least one flinch when firing off rock slide in doubles use of multiples of four when allocating IVs or the percentage of damage increase and decrease that occurs with stat changes and items I knew I hit the nail on the head when one kid went to me quote so if I get better at maths I get better at Pokemon - end quote that's really cute actually so anyways I have two questions one what is the probability of gaining at least one flinch when you fire off a rock slide in doubles please show all your workings Travis and we'll just need to be polite that goes for you too Steve if you're playing number two computer games often get bad press in terms of in terms of the influences they have on children but do you feel that Pokemon is different I'm assuming Peter games just means like general video games yeah thanks so much and keep up the great work as a busy teacher and dad your podcast and slack community have really kept me going when I've had to drop a lot of the more time-consuming elements of my social life Daniel slack named Steph folks staples - folks thank you for the email I wasn't rockslides probability like 30 percent flinch sort of 25 rock slides probability of causing a flinch its mm it's high enough that you use it in competitive and it's low enough that people get mad when it actually goes off alright so yeah it's Act the accuracy of rock slide to start with is 90 percent mm-hmm and then it has a 30% chance of causing flinch so ten percent that it'll miss if it does hit 30 percent chance that it will cause a flinch there's probably some math that they want us to do to the actual actual value is what is 30 percent of 90 percent I don't know well 30 goes the 30 goes into 90 three times but that that that's not the message yeah not how it works let me bring out my calculator my he I you do that all into the second question computer games often get bad press in terms of influences do you feel Pokemon is different I feel like regardless of the game this question can go down so many avenues but like if I was a parent I would let my kids play video games but it wouldn't be a I think what my parents did was really rewarding and worked it worked for me as a kid when I got home from school I had to do all my homework before I could watch TV or do video games or you know go outside and play which is which was rare because I didn't enjoy going outside and I think that that's not a bad route to go down with kids to say that they get a bad rap there are plenty of games that are extremely educational and influential and I think Pokemon can be influential in the in the sense of something like Pokemon go or even the original Pokemon games where it did require you to meet other people and if I wanted to trade with somebody in pokemon red and blue I would have to you know go over to their house and bring a link cable or if they had a link cable and have a conversation with them and have some sort of fair deal of trading and trading together well I mean you could pull the link cable and cheat and but ya know I think I think those are important but that important but there are there could be situations where a kid plays pokemon red and never talks to anyone about it or goes outside or trades or do it does anything like that so I think you can apply that to most video games yeah I am I don't talk to my sister anymore because I was having a conversation with her one time and I was asking if my niece was playing Pokemon and my sister told me we don't play video games in our house I'd rather my children do things outdoors I've never spoken to her ever again so that's my opinion that's all this this really sides the side story but I think it relates the question did you figure out the the math it's 30% that the deal is right the probability of flinch is not impacted by the percentage hit percentage because technically 30% of the misses were flinches so it's 30% okay all right you did the math not me all right so this this quick side story there was a point in time where I was extremely stressed out this was probably I don't know how long ago this was probably about a year ago let's say probably about a week and a half about yesterday so Irene suggested that I should do meditation and I was like no no I was I was like I'm saying I don't have a problem thinking I don't have any issues when it comes to consistency and work I've you guys get the show every Monday regardless if I'm dying or not so I was like no no no no no I don't need to do that you know I'm saying I'm fine and as you as listeners know that you know I I do meditate now the reason I do was actually because of a video game because of the witness which I've talked about before that it was my favorite game of 2016 and I really really loved it because of that game even though I read was telling me over and over that I should do this and that I would really like it and that it would be really helpful and that there's science behind meditation and that was kind of like the big the big thing for me was like okay cool science can back this up it wasn't until I played through the witness that I realized what was actually going on I'm gonna spoil the witness by the way so strap in and if you if you don't care so the witness is a puzzle game in the sense of you have to draw you have a starting point and you have to get the starting point to the end by completing a specific rule so the rule might be on the first the first puzzles are there are these black squares and there are white squares and when you draw the line the line has to make sure that it goes between all the black and white squares so when you get to the end the black squares are on one side the white squares are on the other side it's like the black and white cookie and then there are different types of puzzles of maybe like you have to draw a line and inside those lines you have to make certain shapes so when you get to the end of the puzzle those shapes have to be formed by the line and something like that so throughout the witness you're on this giant puzzle island and there's a lot of symbols on the island and there a lot of environmental puzzles when you start playing when you're when you're playing the witness not only are you doing these line puzzles to unlock things but you're seeing line puzzles outside of the puzzles it's kind of hard to explain but you could be at the top of the mountain and when you look down you'll notice that the river looks like a puzzle you just did so you start seeing those outside of the the quote-unquote game and so then when you're walking around the witness you're seeing people's audio logs or people's notes and you're picking them up and you're you're discovering those and so when I'm playing the witness I'm thinking like not only am i doing these puzzles because I love puzzle games but now I'm like noticing how the world itself is this giant puzzle and there's these audio logs and there's these papers and they what is this like what is the story here so I'm going through the game and then at one point I'm close to the end but the puzzles are getting harder I told myself I'm just gonna look at the answers to this point I have what I have I've gotten my enjoyment out of the game like I have loved everything up to this point I just don't have anymore time to give it so I just want to look at the answers to get through the last you know 20 or 30 puzzles that red box rental was tick tock tick tock and on you and I just want to see I want to see what the island is about I want to know what happens at the at the end like everything just seems so compelling so fit like everything I love everything about this game I just don't have any more time to give it I just want to see the ending so I look I go through I look up the puzzles I do the puzzles per the rule with the guide in front of me and I'm going deeper and deeper into the end of the game you you get to the very end of the game and you do the last puzzle and this elevator comes out of the ground and you step inside the elevator and the elevator flies it's like Willy Wonka flies over the island and the credits are playing and nothing has been said nothing happens the credits finish and the elevator puts you at the very start of the game nothing is said there's no end story there's no additional dialogue you were just at the beginning of the game so now why I told the story why the witness is so important to me is because what meditation is and why I actually like it and why the witness as a game made me appreciate it is because it was never about the end it was about the journey the entire time I was playing the game I was so enthralled with it I was so in love with it I I was there hasn't been a game it's been the only game in in years where I took out a notebook and I'm writing notes and I'm drawing shapes and I'm taking pictures of my TV and I'm turning them upside down I just couldn't stop thinking about the witness and once I got to the ending and I realized that the journey was the journey I made for myself everything was were memories and feelings that I took and I experienced and it doesn't matter what the actual ending was it was the enjoyment to that point and that really was something that spoke to me and that's actually what meditation is about it's not meditation isn't about some end goal of becoming smarter or becoming more focused or B or or trying to you know clear your mind and and it can they do all that but it's about that journey and that experience meditation really is the actual journey itself and I think that games are powerful like that and I don't think that I would have experienced that without the witness there you go that's my story very off Pokemon topic but I wanted to tell it what if the journey is fraught with danger and peril I have what I would imagine that everyone would interpret that differently yes that's what meditation is for me a horrible maze full of minotaurs and other monsters this message is from Joey hello SP JM crew my question is would you want a live-action Pokemon movie and who would you cast as misty Brock and ash PS what about Gilbert Gottfried as me elf Gilbert Godfried is in disgrace and will never do anything related to Japan ever again if you don't know why probably look it up don't need to go into detail on that I would like a live-action Pokemon movie I think if it's done right that would be a lot of fun I'm really bad at like act I'm really bad at like actors and actresses and I don't I don't know I think we talked about when there were rumors of a live-action Pokemon movie would I want one yes but I would want a live-action Pokemon movie not to have ash misty and Brock in it because I do not want greedy I don't want the Harry Potter effect where you are where like I read all seven Harry Potter books I have it I had a image of what Harry Potter looked like when I was reading those books and then Daniel Radcliffe came along and he was Harry Potter and even though he's not Harry Potter anymore anymore because those movies ended it's hard to when I see like when I see Daniel Radcliffe I see Harry Potter and that's not to say he wasn't bad at his role I think he was a good Harry Potter but I know who ashes and what ash is about out of the 20 years of Pokemon anime I don't think there is a actor in the world that could fill those shoes yeah I agree and for me that it wasn't Harry Potter it was Scott Pilgrim that I read all of the Scott Pilgrim comic books and I had a vision for what Scott Pilgrim was supposed to be and then they cast Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim and he is absolutely not what Scott Pilgrim is supposed to be so that like destroy I haven't seen the movie and I actually never read the last Scott Pilgrim I have no idea how the series resolves I'd never read the last one I was so upset that they cast Michael Cera as Scott's pilgrim when he is so not what Scott Pilgrim is supposed to be so yeah I wouldn't want to see the known characters I'd rather it be more like the the anime series that they did where it was like the retelling of red-and-blue story where those characters were or red and green where it was it was not related to previous content so they could take whatever liberties with it that they wanted the special is from Sam writes in and says hi SBJ and Friends it's I'm running in with three very important questions number one you guys could be any pokemon for a day excluding legendary Zara mythical what Pokemon would you be number two is Travis secretly a vampire and number three could you give a birthday shout-out to my sister Jillian she just started listening to this podcast and she recently got a phone for her birthday thank you for reading Sam but that's really cool shout out to Jillian I think I'm saying that right based on the spelling happy birthday let's get number two out of the way is Travis secretly a vampire no Travis goes to bed at like 8:00 p.m. but you are a vampire no secret about it mmhmm yeah that that's accurate and actually it just a zoo bat number one a Pokemon for a day well oh that's tough one can I be like bowls wall but buzz bulb eyes as well I mean technically an ultra-beam edges yeah that's why that's what I want to be bus full because I want to push the edges I'm one of my buzz will is gross yeah what's a better one first school it's all about the banging and clanging and I still haven't been able to get you in the gym or clanging and banging whatever why do you got to be an ultra beast cuz they can go through wormholes but not me like they go they could go through wormholes probably like deoxys can but I can't pick the axis because they the axis isn't classify it as an ultra beast but the axis is like a legendary also so damn so legendary or mythical it's off-limits that's why that's why I'm picking so I'm picking it all to be breaking the rules I want to be something fantastic but accessible I mean it's only for a day I know but so it's like what what can you do in that one day probably like you should be a flying-type so you can go someplace and then it's like oh I'm a human again but look I'm in British Columbia you could probably be like a gang gar and then go invisible like rob a bank well I mean probably when you say Rob it sounds so violent you just borrow the money and forget to return it hmm being a ghost type would be kind of weird though because then you're like a spirit yeah what's a Pokemon that has a really cool unique move what about a toga kiss that's such like a happy Pokemon what would you be doing flying around and being happy hmm putting Thunder Wave on people and then doing fuse ray and then flinching ma my Togekiss is more of a follow the finger I've indeed follow follow me well if you're gonna use the English term for it it's um what's something gen-5 it's like real choice Garrett betray on no bare take I want to you polar bear Pascal and Pascal and nobody likes braver Airy gravy area yeah that's legit but baby baby area is pretty sweet you could mmm you know you could carry an American flag with you but I would be the American flag yeah nice bald eagle and bald eagles are native to the Washington DC area so so you wouldn't be like poached like an egg yeah no Josh just writes in hello there s BJ will Travis Micah Irene whoever is on just us just the two of us just the two of us my name is Josh and I am from salving ttyn Connecticut shout out to Mike from South in Connecticut who wrote in on episode 273 that's really cool I've probably been through there at some point in my life a lot of time near Connecticut do you all have a Pokemon that you feel is underappreciated I mean that a I mean a Pokemon that you like that doesn't seem to get the love in general from the general community mine is snivel slash Weavile the dark /ice typing makes it pretty irrelevant in the competitive scene and the fact that it's only found in late caves and the game means people tend to already have a full team by the time they find it I think the design is really cool and sleek while the shiny is one of the biggest changes from the original color scheme I'm interested in what you all think thanks Josh for me I would say frost last probably whose ice ghost I just she's real cool and yeah nobody gets that excited for all frost laughs I think mine would probably be lotad lotad is not underrated people love Lotte I don't think so man they do like the Ludicolo though Ludo Cola that dude see it like I think here's my problem is I like Ludicolo a lot and I like lotad a lot but I don't like them as a family does the plant it's weird cuz they're all about the Hat yeah I think it's because like lotad is this really cute looking creature under Bush yeah and Ludicolo is this really goofy looking thing okay no here's the problem the ultimate problem tad is cute yes absent Ludicolo is funny just he's your bud you're gonna have a good time with Ludicolo right mmm lombre is just no bueno not and and his name is literally the Jolly Pokemon and dude looks like he's got a pout going on yeah he's like just like so unhappy with the whole universe and why are you taking my picture right now and like you've got Ludicolo the carefree Pokemon lombre this pose a jolly Pokemon that's a huge lie and then lotad which is the water weed Pokemon shame on you Pokemon company like you like I like I enjoy Ludicolo the maracas the sombrero I'm down but when I have a Ludicolo I just think I want lotad instead but I don't want I still want a Ludicolo lo Ted's not powerful enough and you could have them both you guys yeah yeah you can you could have it all you could have it all I try to put lotad in the top ten of our Kickstarter episode and you all rejected lotad instantly um you made some bad choices lotad is not in the top ten of all Pokemon no hmm I disagree Japanese named OspA I think uh I think that'll wrap it up with questions if you have any comments questions concerns complaints its Corrections you can email me at SP j @ PK men cast calm or go over to pokemon cotton pokemon podcast calm hit that contact button we're gonna move into our pokemon of the week here which is a neato King and because it's Pokemon the week we're gonna mix it up we are I am going to do the move set because Travis is not here but we are going to tell you about this Pokemon which we used to do and we stopped to doing but will is taking that over with my best scientist voice so we'll take it away nito king is a large bipedal purple pokemon with distinct reptilian features it has narrow eyes large spiny ears for like Tufts on its cheeks and a short snout filled with pointed teeth there is a long venomous horn on its forehead and the ridge of spines down its back grey plates cover its chest and belly and there is a gray rounded spine on each elbow each hand was three cause while foot has only a single three claws while each foot has only a single hoof like nail it has a long powerful tail this is a male only species the female counterpart is Nidoqueen it is said that neither Kings tail is capable of toppling a metal transmission tower needle King uses this tail to smash constrict or break the bones of its prey and enemies the tail can be swung to create distance between it and its foes before Neto King charges its steel like hide adds to its powerful rampaging charges Edo King lives in grasslands you said it was hard to read that wasn't so hard to read except for the part that was really poorly written all of these are poorly written though that's very true and that that's not knocking both PD it's just very it's it's not the most readable thing in the world I'm gonna give you a Pokemon go moveset mostly because we picked neato King last minute we didn't get to ask the slack community with moves that was we'll just keep it short and sweet here so yeah if you have a and we plan on doing no normal move sets in the future this is just a one-off but if you have a need o King in Pokemon go the two best moves that you can have for it is poison jab and earthquake you have a possibility of getting poison jab or iron tail as the first move and the second moves you have the possibility of getting earthquake sludge wave and megahorn to get the stab bonus on both of those you get the poison from the poison jab you get the ground from the earthquake those are gonna be the two best so hopefully your needle King or that line has those type of moves and if you're playing Pokemon go you're gonna want to avoid using needle King against Alakazam Espeon and jinx those are kind of the big three that's threatened needle King and finally we can do a little bit of trivia here I know we talked about needle King last week but needle King and its female counterpart needle queen share the same category with Rhydon and rhyperior they are all known as the drill Pokemon X to Groot the extra drill left out apparently additionally all four are partly ground-types although its female counterpart needle Queen cannot be bred nito King can be okay needle Queen and needle King are the only Pokemon with a poison ground type combination huh I don't know that seven gens and only one and finally needle King is a popular choice with the anime rivals as both Ash's main rival Gary and Paul as well as Jimmy both use are all three used needle King and actually ground type is strong against poison type what is mm needle Kings we can ice we took ground poison it's week two it's week two psychic psychic water ground and ice ground on ground violence out because it's got that poison it there yeah yeah so there you have it there's your Pokemon of the week we can wrap up this episode so we did housecleaning at the the beginning so I
