was m2m (11:04 - 11:08)
and they did the song for the mewtwo (11:06 - 11:11)
movie but that wasn't an original song (11:08 - 11:15)
it first debuted on the radio and then (11:11 - 11:17)
that first way to get the song that (11:15 - 11:18)
wasn't (11:17 - 11:20)
on the radio was to buy the pokemon (11:18 - 11:22)
album because itunes didn't exist at the (11:20 - 11:23)
time (11:22 - 11:26)
because cassettes and cds were the the (11:23 - 11:27)
fad (11:26 - 11:29)
back not the fat it was just the (11:27 - 11:30)
standard (11:29 - 11:32)
wasn't the chicken band song original (11:30 - 11:34)
for that video that was really good (11:32 - 11:38)
chicken oh um arcadia i think the song (11:34 - 11:39)

yeah yeah it was by the (11:39 - 11:45)
deep roasted chicken or something (11:42 - 11:47)
well wait didn't the presidents of the (11:45 - 11:49)
united states of america do (11:47 - 11:50)
they did a pokemon song they did it (11:49 - 11:52)
wasn't that an original (11:50 - 11:54)
song oh it was pokey rap the poker rap (11:52 - 11:55)
for (11:54 - 11:58)
it was like after gen 5 right yeah uh (11:55 - 12:00)

the pokemon journeys theme song what is (12:01 - 12:07)
that by lost children (12:03 - 12:07)

and also if it's animated they can have (12:53 - 12:56)
as many guests (12:55 - 12:58)

quote the safety and well-being of our (16:28 - 16:32)
competitors organizers employees local (16:30 - 16:34)
communities and partners continue to be (16:32 - 16:35)
our top priority and the primary (16:34 - 16:36)
consideration (16:35 - 16:38)
with every decision we make players were (16:36 - 16:41)
invited to the 2021 will be invited back (16:38 - 16:44)
to the 2022 event the pokemon company (16:41 - 16:45)
also said other events (16:44 - 16:47)
part of the official play pokemon series (16:45 - 16:49)
will remain suspended until further (16:47 - 16:51)
notice if players want to compete sooner (16:49 - 16:53)
they have to do so with on (16:51 - 16:55)
with events like the pokemon team (16:53 - 16:57)
challenge pokemon players cup (16:55 - 16:58)
uh there is a players cup that will take (16:57 - 17:00)
place starting in june which will (16:58 - 17:00)

and pokken tournament dx (17:02 - 17:06)
other competitions have been canceled (17:05 - 17:08)
due to coveted 19 including the fortnite (17:06 - 17:09)
world cup (17:08 - 17:12)
and evo 2020 yeah that's pretty much the (17:09 - 17:14)
press release it's really hard to have a (17:12 - 17:17)
tournament when you haven't had people (17:14 - 17:18)
playing (17:17 - 17:20)
the last (17:18 - 17:20)
couple months so it kind of kind of (17:21 - 17:24)
makes sense (17:23 - 17:26)
i know it's still very disappointing (17:24 - 17:28)
though but also i'm glad i (17:26 - 17:29)
still haven't gotten my passport so i'm (17:28 - 17:32)
okay yep gives me time the plus side is (17:29 - 17:33)
now you have a whole another year to (17:32 - 17:34)
save up to go to london (17:33 - 17:37)
in theory to piggyback off that again (17:34 - 17:39)
with this we didn't cover this but (17:37 - 17:43)
kashiro harada who (17:39 - 17:47)
is the game director and chief producer (17:43 - 17:50)
who has worked on um tekken games for (17:47 - 17:51)
the past 27 years (17:50 - 17:53)
game director and chief producer i (17:51 - 17:55)
believe of bandai namco (17:53 - 17:59)
what does that matter pogan tournament (17:55 - 17:59)
anyways (17:59 - 18:03)
somebody tweeted at him saying do you (18:00 - 18:04)
consider (18:03 - 18:06)
pokken a one-time only celebration of (18:04 - 18:08)
the great series or are you (18:06 - 18:10)
open to return and make a sequel in the (18:08 - 18:11)
future if you get a chance (18:10 - 18:15)
and uh harada actually (18:11 - 18:16)
tweeted to the person back we have a (18:15 - 18:18)
good relationship with nintendo and the (18:16 - 18:19)
pokemon company (18:18 - 18:22)
uh and pokken has a had a great response (18:19 - 18:24)
i would like to make it again but it's (18:22 - 18:28)
not what we decide it's what they decide (18:24 - 18:30)
i mean it's that's an honest response (18:28 - 18:31)
and i do hope they come out with another (18:30 - 18:32)
pokken (18:31 - 18:34)
the pokken the pokemon company being (18:32 - 18:37)
controlling (18:34 - 18:37)
i would have never thought yeah i just (18:37 - 18:41)
don't know like how old is poking at (18:39 - 18:42)
this point um (18:41 - 18:45)
like the wii u one came out six years (18:42 - 18:46)
ago (18:45 - 18:49)
uh is it five years or six years sure (18:46 - 18:51)
five or six i gotta plug my wii u in (18:49 - 18:53)
because i really like that system so (18:51 - 18:53)
much (18:53 - 18:55)
but what if you just played all those (18:53 - 18:57)
games on the better system called the (18:55 - 18:58)
switch (18:57 - 19:00)
because then i had to buy them again and (18:58 - 19:02)
i already have them i already paid for (19:00 - 19:03)
them on the wii u (19:02 - 19:05)
that's true i mean this is the same (19:03 - 19:06)
company that put out pokken tournament (19:05 - 19:07)
for 60 (19:06 - 19:10)
on the wii u and then put it out again (19:07 - 19:11)
on the switch for (19:10 - 19:13)
60 dollars see i i want them to come out (19:11 - 19:16)
with a new pokken tournament (19:13 - 19:18)
that has more pokemon available because (19:16 - 19:20)
that i think that was my fault (19:18 - 19:22)
now it doesn't have to be all of them (19:20 - 19:24)
but that was my biggest disappoint with (19:22 - 19:25)
pokken tournament was this just (19:24 - 19:27)
there weren't enough pokemon to choose (19:25 - 19:29)
from (19:27 - 19:30)
i mean when they put it out on the (19:29 - 19:32)
switch you could get like (19:30 - 19:36)
blastoise that oh boy he's cool (19:32 - 19:39)
he has water cannons on his shell yeah (19:36 - 19:41)
that's a blastoise for you (19:39 - 19:43)
i don't i mean i don't why would they (19:41 - 19:45)
not make another pokemon (19:43 - 19:47)
if bandai namco wants to make another (19:45 - 19:48)
pokken (19:47 - 19:50)
if the first one sold like i think what (19:48 - 19:52)
was it like two million copies (19:50 - 19:54)
why didn't they make another pokemon (19:52 - 19:55)
conquest why haven't they made another (19:54 - 19:56)
pokemon ranger (19:55 - 20:00)
yeah why steve well i don't see those (19:56 - 20:02)
companies tweeting on twitter about (20:00 - 20:05)
them wanting to do it (20:02 - 20:07)
you don't know maybe the conquest team (20:05 - 20:09)
didn't want to make another conquest (20:07 - 20:10)
maybe they were like working with a (20:09 - 20:12)
pokemon company was rough i mean it's (20:10 - 20:13)
very like (20:12 - 20:15)
i i imagine that it is yes hey they've (20:13 - 20:17)
got high standards to protect i mean (20:15 - 20:19)
there's also like other contracts right (20:17 - 20:21)
this is the thing we always what i (20:19 - 20:22)
always have to argue about with twitch (20:21 - 20:23)
chat (20:22 - 20:26)
where they're like man i wish they would (20:23 - 20:27)
just make x (20:26 - 20:30)
y z well not specifically pokemon xyz (20:27 - 20:31)
xyz could be anything (20:30 - 20:33)
[Laughter] (20:31 - 20:35)
uh and it's like well they have to find (20:33 - 20:37)
a company to make it (20:35 - 20:38)
and there's not a lot of video game (20:37 - 20:40)
companies just sitting around being like (20:38 - 20:42)
boy i wish somebody came to us to make a (20:40 - 20:45)
game we're really bored here like no (20:42 - 20:47)
most video game companies are working on (20:45 - 20:48)
current games (20:47 - 20:51)
and if they they probably once they're (20:48 - 20:53)
done with their contracts of like hey (20:51 - 20:55)
we we're working with this company our (20:53 - 20:57)
contract to make this game is 18 months (20:55 - 20:59)
they probably because they're successful (20:57 - 21:00)
companies or want to be successful (20:59 - 21:02)
companies they probably already have (21:00 - 21:03)
another game lined up after that (21:02 - 21:05)
contract is over so (21:03 - 21:06)
again they're not in the position of (21:05 - 21:08)
like well we shipped that game (21:06 - 21:10)
what are we gonna do well we'll just sit (21:08 - 21:12)
here and hope that somebody knocks on (21:10 - 21:12)
our (21:12 - 21:14)
door like there's there's only so many (21:12 - 21:16)
video game companies out there doing (21:14 - 21:17)
things (21:16 - 21:19)
so i guess if the pokemon company (21:17 - 21:20)
decided they want another pokken (21:19 - 21:21)
tournament (21:20 - 21:22)
then they would have to go to bandai (21:21 - 21:25)
namco put on the to-do list (21:22 - 21:27)
wait for whatever team work is going to (21:25 - 21:28)
work on it and then (21:27 - 21:30)
start developing it i think it's been (21:28 - 21:33)
long enough for a sequel though (21:30 - 21:35)
i mean if it's been more than five years (21:33 - 21:37)
that seems like a good good length (21:35 - 21:38)
i'd probably play it i probably wouldn't (21:37 - 21:40)
love it just because i don't generally (21:38 - 21:40)
love (21:40 - 21:42)
fighting games but i would like to you (21:40 - 21:45)
know play it for a week and then (21:42 - 21:47)
yeah talk about it and then now play it (21:45 - 21:49)
again what if it's really really good (21:47 - 21:49)
though (21:49 - 21:53)
yeah though speaking of other companies (21:49 - 21:57)
working with the pokemon company (21:53 - 21:59)
this is off go nintendo umbrella the (21:57 - 22:01)
developer behind pokemon (21:59 - 22:04)
rumble has been acquired and dissolved (22:01 - 22:08)
by creatures incorporated (22:04 - 22:08)
uh creatures has a few new people (22:09 - 22:14)
working under their umbrella (22:11 - 22:15)
at the end of the last year creatures (22:14 - 22:17)
inc officially acquired (22:15 - 22:19)
ambrella the company behind pokemon (22:17 - 22:21)
rumble and a few other pokemon related (22:19 - 22:22)
spin-offs (22:21 - 22:24)
since acquiring the company creatures (22:22 - 22:26)
has dissolved it while retaining the (22:24 - 22:28)
employees that were working for it (22:26 - 22:30)
they'll continue as one big team for (22:28 - 22:32)
future projects (22:30 - 22:34)
that makes sense it's it takes away the (22:32 - 22:35)
corporate the unnecessary corporate (22:34 - 22:36)
overhead while (22:35 - 22:40)
still maintaining the knowledge of the (22:36 - 22:42)
employees that have been working (22:40 - 22:44)
i think it's more so like they want the (22:42 - 22:46)
games under the pokemon umbrella (22:44 - 22:48)
not necessarily the people are they (22:46 - 22:50)
going to acquire and dissolve (22:48 - 22:53)
niantic no um because they probably (22:50 - 22:54)
don't know (22:53 - 22:55)
they probably have a good relationship (22:54 - 22:57)
with them maybe not yet (22:55 - 22:59)
this is this is this is just the problem (22:57 - 23:00)
with like miramax (22:59 - 23:03)
oh wait isn't niantic co-owned between (23:00 - 23:04)
google and (23:03 - 23:08)
nintendo and pokemon um (23:04 - 23:10)
i think nintendo's a very very small (23:08 - 23:12)
stake in (23:10 - 23:15)
niantic but niantic is mostly owned by (23:12 - 23:16)
google (23:15 - 23:19)
which wait alphabet i think it's owned (23:16 - 23:20)
by alphabet (23:19 - 23:22)
alphabet yeah if you don't know who (23:20 - 23:23)
umbrella is (23:22 - 23:26)
uh they were founded in 1996 uh they (23:23 - 23:27)
were (23:26 - 23:31)
their own private company they made (23:27 - 23:34)
hey you pikachu in 1998 they made (23:31 - 23:36)
pokemon channel (23:34 - 23:39)
in 2003 they made pokemon dash which was (23:36 - 23:41)
the first official pokemon game on the (23:39 - 23:43)
nintendo ds in 2004. (23:41 - 23:47)
the amazing pokemon dash you forgot we (23:43 - 23:48)
can we talk about years too because (23:47 - 23:51)
there's no other list of games okay so (23:48 - 23:54)
1998 was hey you pikachu yeah five years (23:51 - 23:57)
later (23:54 - 23:57)
they made pokemon channel which wasn't (23:57 - 24:01)
really a game it was more of like a (23:59 - 24:05)
pet simulator uh a year a year yeah sure (24:01 - 24:07)
a year later they made pokemon dash (24:05 - 24:08)
2004. (24:07 - 24:10)
a year later they released pokemon dash (24:08 - 24:12)
we got to get away from this idea like (24:10 - 24:12)
they (24:12 - 24:14)
finished pokemon channel in 2003 and (24:12 - 24:16)
then in a year (24:14 - 24:18)
well they could have put pokemon yeah (24:16 - 24:20)
you know in that situation i think they (24:18 - 24:22)
did pump that out in a year (24:20 - 24:25)
uh okay so in 2008 they released (24:22 - 24:28)
my pokemon ranch which was four years (24:25 - 24:29)
between (24:28 - 24:31)
pokemon dash and my pokemon ranch which (24:29 - 24:32)
was (24:31 - 24:34)
i guess if you didn't play my pokemon (24:32 - 24:35)
ranch there's not much to play think of (24:34 - 24:38)
it as like a visual (24:35 - 24:41)
version of pokemon bank in 2009 they (24:38 - 24:44)
released pokemon rumble (24:41 - 24:47)
yep in 2011 so two years later they (24:44 - 24:49)
released pokemon rumble blast (24:47 - 24:51)
and then in another two years they (24:49 - 24:54)
released pokemon rumble u (24:51 - 24:55)
and then another two years they released (24:54 - 24:58)
pokemon rumble world (24:55 - 25:01)
and then in 2017 they put out a you (24:58 - 25:03)
versus the universe which is an arcade (25:01 - 25:04)
game on mobile (25:03 - 25:07)
nothing to do with pokemon or nintendo (25:04 - 25:08)
it was uh they were it was even (25:07 - 25:10)
self-published (25:08 - 25:13)
and in 2019 they put out pokemon rumble (25:10 - 25:17)
rush which was done also a mobile game (25:13 - 25:21)
and that was it not a lot of variety (25:17 - 25:23)
coming from umbrella and i would say i (25:21 - 25:25)
would argue (25:23 - 25:29)
not a lot of hits hey (25:25 - 25:32)
i enjoyed my pokemon ranch (25:29 - 25:34)
yeah i think pokemon ranch is like a (25:32 - 25:35)
really cool concept (25:34 - 25:37)
it would be nice if if you paid 16 a (25:35 - 25:39)
year for a service you could do (25:37 - 25:40)
something more with it like you could (25:39 - 25:41)
with pokemon ranch (25:40 - 25:44)
yeah i mean you could you could whistle (25:41 - 25:46)
and they could come over and dance (25:44 - 25:47)
around you oh they already (25:46 - 25:50)
do that in sword and shield that's true (25:47 - 25:52)
let's not do that but they can't stack (25:50 - 25:55)
on top of each (25:52 - 25:58)
entire other full of them it's yours (25:55 - 26:00)
select six are camping with you (25:58 - 26:02)
ranch they were all there flying (26:00 - 26:03)
overhead (26:02 - 26:07)
zipping around well maybe in (26:03 - 26:08)
pokemon scepter i don't know what is the (26:07 - 26:10)
next one gonna be (26:08 - 26:13)
sword shield crown we already got a (26:10 - 26:14)
crown (26:13 - 26:16)
no they not gonna do a third version (26:14 - 26:18)
they already said that oh (26:16 - 26:20)
you naysayer they don't say they were (26:18 - 26:22)
the ones that said that (26:20 - 26:26)
they're misleading you they're (26:22 - 26:26)
so according to wikipedia in in 2019 (26:27 - 26:31)
creatures (26:30 - 26:34)
had 144 people working for them (26:31 - 26:38)
how many 144 wow (26:34 - 26:41)
game freak according to 2019 (26:38 - 26:44)
had 143 people working for them but (26:41 - 26:47)
i think that's not correct i almost (26:44 - 26:49)
swore that there was an article last (26:47 - 26:50)
year (26:49 - 26:53)
where omori said they're up to like 200 (26:50 - 26:55)
and something employees now (26:53 - 26:56)
i i remember that article because yeah (26:55 - 26:58)
we did talk about that (26:56 - 26:59)
yeah because that was when people were (26:58 - 27:00)
complaining like why don't they just (26:59 - 27:02)
hire more people which (27:00 - 27:05)
it's yeah a very simple solution you (27:02 - 27:07)
just do it overnight right (27:05 - 27:09)
you just knock down the business wall (27:07 - 27:10)
next to you you (27:09 - 27:12)
build a bunch of cubicles you just hire (27:10 - 27:14)
50 people and you call it a day (27:12 - 27:17)
that's how businesses work i i don't (27:14 - 27:18)
know how many people worked out at (27:17 - 27:19)
umbrella i have no clue i don't know if (27:18 - 27:20)
it was like 12 (27:19 - 27:22)
people i don't know if it was 100 i (27:20 - 27:23)
doubt it was a hundred people (27:22 - 27:25)
if there was a hundred people working on (27:23 - 27:26)
pokemon rumble (27:25 - 27:29)
i don't know who was getting paid i mean (27:26 - 27:31)
they were probably a solid (27:29 - 27:33)
30 to 40 people i mean it's cool that it (27:31 - 27:35)
doesn't seem like any of them lost their (27:33 - 27:35)
jobs (27:35 - 27:39)
i i do think that like having the i mean (27:35 - 27:42)
yet you right yes yeah i (27:39 - 27:45)
will tell you that it's the new way of (27:42 - 27:47)
acquiring companies (27:45 - 27:49)
is you keep everybody on for the first (27:47 - 27:51)
year because after that first year (27:49 - 27:53)
people stop checking in (27:51 - 27:56)
and then you get rid of all the dead (27:53 - 27:57)
weight (27:56 - 28:00)
in mandatory necessary layoffs to match (27:57 - 28:02)
the market (28:00 - 28:03)
i i would not be surprised though that (28:02 - 28:06)
if this is like pokemon's (28:03 - 28:08)
motive is to get everything they want (28:06 - 28:09)
back (28:08 - 28:13)
oh i'm sure and what i mean by that is (28:09 - 28:14)
the the thing you can point to very (28:13 - 28:16)
easily is miramax (28:14 - 28:18)
when any time there's a pokemon movie (28:16 - 28:20)
marathon anytime there's (28:18 - 28:23)
um anything movie related (28:20 - 28:25)
there's four mirror max movies that they (28:23 - 28:27)
always seem to skip which is (28:25 - 28:30)
destiny deoxys the one where ash (28:27 - 28:34)
kisses latias um dorache wishmaker (28:30 - 28:38)
and gosh what's the last one but miramax (28:34 - 28:39)
technically (28:38 - 28:41)
owns those movies which mirror max is (28:39 - 28:44)
now owned by like disney or something (28:41 - 28:46)
so who knows who owns what but when you (28:44 - 28:48)
when you bought when you just buy out (28:46 - 28:49)
umbrella (28:48 - 28:52)
in this situation you now have all of (28:49 - 28:53)
these things (28:52 - 28:56)
under your belt instead of like maybe (28:53 - 28:57)
you want to use haiti pikachu you gotta (28:56 - 28:58)
go back to umbrella umbrella has to (28:57 - 29:00)
approve it because it's probably they (28:58 - 29:02)
probably have some part ownership of it (29:00 - 29:05)
and now now they just own it whereas i (29:02 - 29:07)
would assume (29:05 - 29:10)
that this is why you know (29:07 - 29:12)
when they do do the movies they have to (29:10 - 29:14)
go back to miramax and miramax (29:12 - 29:16)
probably wants a cut and then they just (29:14 - 29:19)
go you know what we have 16 other movies (29:16 - 29:20)
don't worry about it or max we don't (29:19 - 29:22)
want to give you any money (29:20 - 29:25)
exactly well i mean miramax was bought (29:22 - 29:26)
by disney so (29:25 - 29:28)
i'm i can't imagine that and it's like (29:26 - 29:30)
the pokemon anime isn't on disney (29:28 - 29:31)
anymore it seems they went to a (29:30 - 29:32)
different (29:31 - 29:35)
yeah it seems like gonna be a bit of a (29:32 - 29:35)
thing (29:35 - 29:38)
to get them but we do know the pokemon (29:35 - 29:40)
company is really good at holding out (29:38 - 29:42)
case in point cadabra (29:40 - 29:46)
oh yeah they'll stonewall (29:42 - 29:50)
forever we're not going to give an inch (29:46 - 29:53)
yeah we got 800 million other pokemon we (29:50 - 29:54)
don't need your (29:53 - 29:57)
movies hey uh rumble you used those uh (29:54 - 29:57)
like (29:57 - 30:00)
nfc fake amiibo things back in the day (29:57 - 30:02)
those were funny true the ones you had (30:00 - 30:04)
to get from the eggs maybe (30:02 - 30:06)
maybe that's creatures next goal maybe (30:04 - 30:08)
uh the ones you had to get from (30:06 - 30:10)
the eggs they were pokeballs weren't (30:08 - 30:12)
they like mystery mystery boxes (30:10 - 30:14)
they were mystery boxes yes you had to (30:12 - 30:15)
buy yeah (30:14 - 30:16)
because i remember walking in the game (30:15 - 30:18)
stop and asking if i could buy a whole (30:16 - 30:20)
box (30:18 - 30:23)
i remember oh just like your (30:20 - 30:26)
uh mcdonald's scalping ways no i opened (30:23 - 30:26)
them all (30:26 - 30:29)
and did not sell any of them i don't (30:26 - 30:30)
even think (30:29 - 30:32)
i think i only got one or two doubles (30:30 - 30:33)
because i was (30:32 - 30:35)
because somebody i don't know somebody (30:33 - 30:37)
on some forum says like (30:35 - 30:39)
said like every box was guaranteed like (30:37 - 30:41)
one shiny (30:39 - 30:44)
and you're better off buying a box than (30:41 - 30:46)
just buying individual ones (30:44 - 30:48)
i was like okay i'll buy a box because i (30:46 - 30:50)
want to collect them all (30:48 - 30:52)
i think there was a shiny eevee and a (30:50 - 30:53)
shiny pikachu (30:52 - 30:55)
those those are probably worth 100 bucks (30:53 - 30:57)
each that'd be my guess (30:55 - 30:59)
i think there was a genesect as well i (30:57 - 31:03)
don't know where these amiibo things are (30:59 - 31:03)
you have collected so many things that (31:03 - 31:08)
you have lost track of your collection (31:06 - 31:11)
yes hey you know when i find (31:08 - 31:13)
the keep adding cards when i find the (31:11 - 31:16)
the pre-dated pokemon amiibos (31:13 - 31:18)
i'll put them next to my burger king (31:16 - 31:21)
gold cards and my ancient mew (31:18 - 31:24)
and i'll just let him appreciate (31:21 - 31:26)
speaking of appreciation let's take a (31:24 - 31:28)
break and (31:26 - 31:29)
when we come back we will talk about (31:28 - 31:33)

saw a bulbasaur (31:49 - 31:56)
in the real world i saw (31:52 - 31:58)
a bulbasaur walking around and it was (31:56 - 32:01)
amazing (31:58 - 32:05)
i saw a bulbasaur walking around and it (32:01 - 32:06)
was amazing (32:05 - 32:07)
we already know that (32:06 - 32:14)
[Music] (32:07 - 32:18)
i saw a bulbasaur (32:14 - 32:21)
i hope it's sweet and nice and (32:18 - 32:24)
we are back from our break (32:21 - 32:28)
this is off pokemon.com a pokemon sword (32:24 - 32:29)
and shield global challenge (32:28 - 32:31)
winter features powerful legendary (32:29 - 32:33)
pokemon it will take place (32:31 - 32:35)
because the pokemon company likes to (32:33 - 32:37)
plan everything on the same weekend it (32:35 - 32:39)
will take place between february 25th (32:37 - 32:39)
through the 28th (32:39 - 32:42)
why i don't it's like the worst timing (32:39 - 32:44)
ever would you do this (32:42 - 32:46)
we're going to be watching a post malone (32:44 - 32:47)
concert yeah (32:46 - 32:49)
trying to get busy trying to get hip (32:47 - 32:51)
with the popular music (32:49 - 32:54)
i'm i'm busy being a malone head what (32:51 - 32:55)
are they called (32:54 - 32:57)
maloneys (32:55 - 33:00)
[Laughter] (32:57 - 33:03)
the rules for the tournament will will (33:00 - 33:05)
take place with series eight rules (33:03 - 33:07)
so there's nothing special or fun about (33:05 - 33:08)
this competition (33:07 - 33:10)
you're allowed to use one restricted (33:08 - 33:12)
pokemon so mewtwo lugia ho oh (33:10 - 33:14)

calorics not and you can only use one of (33:35 - 33:40)
these (33:37 - 33:42)
it's a casual competition so no champion (33:40 - 33:43)
points are on the line (33:42 - 33:45)
i believe you only get 50 battle points (33:43 - 33:47)
for participating no shirt no ball gas (33:45 - 33:49)
shirts i was just gonna say which ball (33:47 - 33:50)
guys shirt do i get but i guess i don't (33:49 - 33:51)
get any (33:50 - 33:54)
until there's a luxury ball guys shirt (33:51 - 33:55)
i'm just i'm (33:54 - 33:57)
this game is incomplete so that is the (33:55 - 33:59)
global winter challenge (33:57 - 34:01)
2021 again it'll take place february (33:59 - 34:03)
25th to 28th if you want your 50 battle (34:01 - 34:04)
points (34:03 - 34:05)
you just have to do one battle doesn't (34:04 - 34:06)
matter whether you win or lose you get (34:05 - 34:09)
your 50 battle points for participating (34:06 - 34:10)
the other news and this was sent by (34:09 - 34:12)
brandon from our slack community (34:10 - 34:15)
is that we are we're recording this on (34:12 - 34:18)
february 18th we're only 18 days into (34:15 - 34:19)
series eight (34:18 - 34:21)
series eight goes for three months we (34:19 - 34:23)
are 18 days in and the pokemon company (34:21 - 34:24)
announced that (34:23 - 34:28)
series nine will go back to the rules of (34:24 - 34:29)
series seven (34:28 - 34:32)
why and that will begin on may 1st why (34:29 - 34:34)
did they go back (34:32 - 34:37)
i don't know yeah (34:34 - 34:41)
maybe it was a better time it was they (34:37 - 34:42)
just realized (34:41 - 34:45)
so they're still like a qualifier for so (34:42 - 34:46)
they haven't sent out (34:45 - 34:48)
the invites for players cup three but (34:46 - 34:49)
they (34:48 - 34:54)
will send it out probably before may 1st (34:49 - 34:57)
and there's a top cut that needs to take (34:54 - 35:00)
place this is my only thought process (34:57 - 35:04)
so so the thinking is they wanted (35:00 - 35:07)
series 8 to be featured in players cup (35:04 - 35:10)
3 for the streams that they do (35:07 - 35:14)
and then they'll change it which is fine (35:10 - 35:15)
because that's what happened with (35:14 - 35:18)
players cup two you started in series (35:15 - 35:20)
five and then when you participated it (35:18 - 35:21)
was series six (35:20 - 35:24)
so that's fine i don't understand two (35:21 - 35:24)
things (35:24 - 35:28)
one why announces so early (35:24 - 35:30)
like we're not even into a full month of (35:28 - 35:32)
this rule set and you're like (35:30 - 35:35)
hey we got two more months of this but (35:32 - 35:36)
also (35:35 - 35:38)
we're gonna go back on it and it's fine (35:36 - 35:40)
to remove the legends (35:38 - 35:42)
why just go directly back to series (35:40 - 35:44)
seven and not do like okay we're going (35:42 - 35:45)
series seven but we're going to ban five (35:44 - 35:48)
pokemon or we're doing series seven but (35:45 - 35:49)
or we're doing well i guess what people (35:48 - 35:52)
wanted from what i saw is people wanted (35:49 - 35:54)
series eight but instead of two (35:52 - 35:55)
restricted you would have instead of one (35:54 - 35:57)
restricted you have two restricted which (35:55 - 35:58)
is what the rule set was (35:57 - 36:01)
for the ultra cup in ultra sun ultra (35:58 - 36:02)
moon (36:01 - 36:03)
but we're literally just going back to (36:02 - 36:05)
series seven which was everything (36:03 - 36:08)
but these one restricteds that's when (36:05 - 36:10)
hershey foo was on top and tapu finney (36:08 - 36:11)
was on top (36:10 - 36:12)
are they unhappy with the amount of (36:11 - 36:14)
people participating (36:12 - 36:16)
in the ranked ladder where they're like (36:14 - 36:18)
oh no no one likes this let's go back (36:16 - 36:21)
maybe but it also like why would you (36:18 - 36:22)
announce it (36:21 - 36:25)
now because i feel like for me i just (36:22 - 36:28)
don't even want to build a team anymore (36:25 - 36:28)
why because it's gonna just be the same (36:28 - 36:33)
old team that you had before (36:31 - 36:34)
yeah because it will go back so i had a (36:33 - 36:36)
bunch of teams for series seven that i (36:34 - 36:38)
really liked and right now i'm like (36:36 - 36:40)
struggling to find something i do like (36:38 - 36:41)
in series eight (36:40 - 36:44)
and so i could i could keep going to (36:41 - 36:45)
between different teams and that's (36:44 - 36:47)
totally fine like competitive pokemon (36:45 - 36:48)
players are used to (36:47 - 36:49)
changing your teams and changing your (36:48 - 36:51)
real sets but also like i could just (36:49 - 36:52)
plan for (36:51 - 36:54)
more teams for series seven of like oh (36:52 - 36:56)
this these are unfinished thoughts i had (36:54 - 36:58)
for series seven now i can (36:56 - 37:02)
finish working on them yeah but wait (36:58 - 37:04)
all right this is where i'm perplexed (37:02 - 37:05)
and confused (37:04 - 37:08)
series eight is a casual tournament (37:05 - 37:09)
right (37:08 - 37:12)
series eight is the current ranked rules (37:09 - 37:13)
on the left oh (37:12 - 37:17)
dagnabbit okay and the winter challenge (37:13 - 37:20)
is also using series eight and we series (37:17 - 37:21)
eight (37:20 - 37:23)
defines a concept of the way that you (37:21 - 37:24)
battle (37:23 - 37:26)
but it's not the actual battle (37:24 - 37:28)
tournament itself (37:26 - 37:31)
correct okay yes that is (37:28 - 37:34)
it's like in the tcg they released a new (37:31 - 37:35)
set of cards (37:34 - 37:36)
and you're like i got all these things (37:35 - 37:38)
to work with but in three months they're (37:36 - 37:39)
going to (37:38 - 37:41)
release a new set of cards but in this (37:39 - 37:42)
instance they're like we're just taking (37:41 - 37:44)
away the last set we (37:42 - 37:46)
gave you and we're going back to the set (37:44 - 37:48)
before (37:46 - 37:50)
yeah it is weird because it's not a step (37:48 - 37:51)
forward (37:50 - 37:54)
but i get very yeah i (37:51 - 37:56)
maybe it's just they they realize that (37:54 - 38:00)
series 8 was super flawed or (37:56 - 38:01)
i think they can realize that though in (38:00 - 38:03)
like two weeks (38:01 - 38:05)
i mean they can see the meta evolve that (38:03 - 38:06)
quickly sure (38:05 - 38:10)
or maybe they started developing series (38:06 - 38:11)
nine or got sufficiently far down the (38:10 - 38:13)
road for developing what they were (38:11 - 38:14)
thinking for series nine and then (38:13 - 38:16)
realized (38:14 - 38:17)
like somebody came running in the room (38:16 - 38:19)
at the last minute and said hey wait a (38:17 - 38:20)
minute we found (38:19 - 38:23)
this one thing remember because of the (38:20 - 38:26)
thing that we're doing on february 29th (38:23 - 38:29)
and they're like oh that's right and (38:26 - 38:30)
then it's like oh series nine can't (38:29 - 38:31)
happen (38:30 - 38:33)
i guess they could yeah we do we can't (38:31 - 38:34)
keep series eight people we're gonna get (38:33 - 38:36)
bored of that all right well let's go (38:34 - 38:37)
back to series seven people like series (38:36 - 38:38)
seven (38:37 - 38:41)
i mean i guess they could just they (38:38 - 38:43)
could also just (38:41 - 38:45)
change series nine and say well we were (38:43 - 38:47)
gonna do series seven but now it's gonna (38:45 - 38:49)
be series seven plus (38:47 - 38:51)
a brand new pokemon we're showing on (38:49 - 38:52)
saturday (38:51 - 38:55)
there you go (38:52 - 38:55)
[Music] (38:55 - 38:59)
i don't know it seems a little weird it (38:56 - 39:00)
just seems weird that they announced it (38:59 - 39:01)
i don't think it would (39:00 - 39:04)
seem as weird if they announced it like (39:01 - 39:05)
two weeks before (39:04 - 39:07)
it was going to be series nine when they (39:05 - 39:09)
announced series (39:07 - 39:11)
seven we didn't hear about the series (39:09 - 39:13)
eight rules until a week before series 8 (39:11 - 39:14)
started (39:13 - 39:17)
yeah yeah that's weird but they got a (39:14 - 39:19)
lot going on (39:17 - 39:21)
they got a concert plan maybe they (39:19 - 39:23)
wanted to just get ahead of it and say (39:21 - 39:24)
look (39:23 - 39:26)
we're going to be doing this two steps (39:24 - 39:28)
forward one step back thing for a while (39:26 - 39:29)
so (39:28 - 39:30)
speaking of two steps forward this is (39:29 - 39:33)
pokemon.com pokemon unite (39:30 - 39:35)
development update and regional beta (39:33 - 39:37)
test in canada (39:35 - 39:40)
for android users canadian residents can (39:37 - 39:42)
go hands-on with the upcoming game (39:40 - 39:45)
yeah since the first reveal of pokemon (39:42 - 39:47)
unite nearly a year ago development has (39:45 - 39:48)
continued progress (39:47 - 39:50)
more playable pokemon have been added uh (39:48 - 39:52)
challenges and additions have been made (39:50 - 39:53)
to gameplay and visuals have improved (39:52 - 39:54)
and much (39:53 - 39:56)
more how can you make improvements on (39:54 - 39:59)
the game that we haven't even gotten yet (39:56 - 40:00)
and why does canada get all the good (39:59 - 40:02)
stuff first i have a (40:00 - 40:04)
theory that said there is still plenty (40:02 - 40:06)
to be done to ensure the best possible (40:04 - 40:08)
experience now the developers are (40:06 - 40:10)
looking for pokemon fans to help deliver (40:08 - 40:11)
that experience by participating in a (40:10 - 40:13)
regional beta test in canada (40:11 - 40:15)
we've talked about this before but it's (40:13 - 40:17)
been in beta for quite a while in china (40:15 - 40:20)
uh this march players in canada will (40:17 - 40:22)
have their first opportunity to play (40:20 - 40:23)
pokemon unite i'm just going to stop (40:22 - 40:24)
here because (40:23 - 40:25)
all week i've been hearing that they're (40:24 - 40:28)
gonna shadow drop unite on the 27th or (40:25 - 40:30)
whatever's pokemon day (40:28 - 40:33)
nope nah if you just go to pokemon.com (40:30 - 40:36)
those rumors are very much squashed (40:33 - 40:39)
they are going to shadow drop pokemon (40:36 - 40:40)
sleep (40:39 - 40:42)
this march players in canada will have (40:40 - 40:43)
their first opportunity to play pokemon (40:42 - 40:44)
unite (40:43 - 40:46)
while the game is planned for release (40:44 - 40:49)
for apple and android devices and the (40:46 - 40:50)
nintendo switch (40:49 - 40:52)
this beta will be limited to android (40:50 - 40:54)
devices interested trainers can (40:52 - 40:56)
visit the unite page this is you can do (40:54 - 40:57)
this right off pokemon.com (40:56 - 41:00)
in the google play store for details the (40:57 - 41:00)
unite (41:00 - 41:02)
regional beta test is open to only (41:00 - 41:04)
residents of canada you must be 16 years (41:02 - 41:05)
old or older (41:04 - 41:08)
your in-game progress will will reset (41:05 - 41:10)
when the beta is over (41:08 - 41:12)
capturing or streaming gameplay is not (41:10 - 41:13)
allowed during the beta (41:12 - 41:16)
and and that's pretty much it i would (41:13 - 41:17)
assume (41:16 - 41:19)
on pokemon day we maybe get a time frame (41:17 - 41:20)
for this game whether it's going to be (41:19 - 41:22)
like a summer release or a spring (41:20 - 41:24)
release or (41:22 - 41:26)
that's reasonable 2022 release but i (41:24 - 41:27)
don't see (41:26 - 41:29)
them saying hey canada you'll be able to (41:27 - 41:31)
test it in march and then (41:29 - 41:33)
somehow release the game before that (41:31 - 41:34)
that doesn't make sense (41:33 - 41:36)
but but honestly if they are ready to (41:34 - 41:38)
test the game in united states light (41:36 - 41:40)
then that means that they're pretty (41:38 - 41:42)
close in to releasing it in the united (41:40 - 41:43)
states regular (41:42 - 41:47)
if yeah maybe if listeners don't (41:43 - 41:48)
remember (41:47 - 41:51)
pokemon go was in australia early (41:48 - 41:52)
i know the australians get all the good (41:51 - 41:55)
stuff first yeah but this is my (41:52 - 41:58)
theory 12 hours before us (41:55 - 42:01)
my theory is that mobas are some of the (41:58 - 42:02)
most toxic player (42:01 - 42:04)
moba players are some of the most toxic (42:02 - 42:05)
players on the internet (42:04 - 42:08)
so the pokemon company looks to (42:05 - 42:11)
the nicest players on the internet which (42:08 - 42:12)
is canada (42:11 - 42:15)
where they apologize every time they oh (42:12 - 42:15)
sorry (42:15 - 42:18)
there a didn't mean to take your lane (42:15 - 42:20)
that was my best canadian impression (42:18 - 42:23)
wow hey i mean you could have done that (42:20 - 42:26)
i put the open i put the a that's all (42:23 - 42:26)
you need (42:26 - 42:29)
they don't do oh that's a minnesotan (42:26 - 42:30)
thing maybe they're like (42:29 - 42:32)
very northern maybe they're you know (42:30 - 42:33)
quebec (42:32 - 42:37)
that's not on the border of minnesota (42:33 - 42:38)
you are correct quebec is not on the (42:37 - 42:40)
border of minnesota (42:38 - 42:42)
can we talk about your offensive nerd (42:40 - 42:44)
stereotype when you put your glasses on (42:42 - 42:46)

actual person (42:46 - 42:50)

the voice i'm doing right now is the (42:50 - 42:54)
persona (42:51 - 42:54)

pokemon something let's look at florida (45:02 - 45:06)
man pokemon i'm sure i'm sure somebody's (45:04 - 45:09)
gotten arrested i will say (45:06 - 45:11)
for the mcdonald's debacle the most (45:09 - 45:12)
expensive card (45:11 - 45:14)
last time we reported was the pikachu (45:12 - 45:18)
card the hollow pikachu is going for 80. (45:14 - 45:20)
it's been a week over a week hollow (45:18 - 45:23)
pikachu only going for forty dollars now (45:20 - 45:25)
it's dropped half its price enough oh (45:23 - 45:26)
you gotta sell (45:25 - 45:29)
you gotta sell now uh (45:26 - 45:32)
i would expect as the as we go another (45:29 - 45:34)
week it will drop even more (45:32 - 45:35)
did you see that people bought all the (45:34 - 45:38)
levi's stuff into scalping those no two (45:35 - 45:42)
uh when i looked the the garden jeans (45:38 - 45:43)
were available (45:42 - 45:45)
the jeans were like 180 dollars and (45:43 - 45:46)
they're not even that's why (45:45 - 45:48)
i didn't get them because they were not (45:46 - 45:50)
501s (45:48 - 45:52)
yeah if i'm gonna pay over a hundred (45:50 - 45:54)
dollars for a pair of jeans i need (45:52 - 45:57)
i need that to be fresh off the the (45:54 - 45:58)
weaving machine (45:57 - 46:01)
there is no way there's no way with the (45:58 - 46:02)
treatment on those (46:01 - 46:06)
pants in the forest style that those are (46:02 - 46:07)
raw denim straight (46:06 - 46:09)
like that no no that could that could i (46:07 - 46:11)
mean it just wouldn't be rope dyed so (46:09 - 46:16)
so the oh (46:11 - 46:16)
you you keep in mind when we talk about (46:21 - 46:26)
like the superior denims number one it's (46:24 - 46:28)
the dying process right so you want rope (46:26 - 46:30)
dyed obviously they cannot do rope dyed (46:28 - 46:31)
if there's a printed pattern (46:30 - 46:33)
right on the genes number two you want (46:31 - 46:35)
them to use a rigid headed loom (46:33 - 46:38)
and then number three is the self edge (46:35 - 46:39)
which is the type of (46:38 - 46:41)
the way that they kind of finish the (46:39 - 46:42)
edges of the gene (46:41 - 46:45)
uh so you could have two and three who's (46:42 - 46:46)
the nerd now okay let me (46:45 - 46:48)
let me give you the the als the cliff (46:46 - 46:49)
notes here most jeans (46:48 - 46:53)
at a store are washed multiple times my (46:49 - 46:55)
jeans are clean (46:53 - 46:57)
well no no no they're washed be it's (46:55 - 46:59)
different wash they're still clean (46:57 - 47:02)
right (46:59 - 47:02)
but that's when you first wash a pair of (47:02 - 47:06)
raw denim you're going to get a ton of (47:04 - 47:07)
dye (47:06 - 47:10)
out of them whereas if you wash a pair (47:07 - 47:12)
of like levi's from coals (47:10 - 47:14)
it's not it's not gonna like dye your (47:12 - 47:16)
washing machine blue (47:14 - 47:18)
but but i mean the main concept of (47:16 - 47:20)
dyeing raw denim jeans (47:18 - 47:22)
is that they use a rope dyeing process (47:20 - 47:24)
which primarily dyes the (47:22 - 47:27)
outside of the fiber and does not reach (47:24 - 47:28)
to the inside of the fiber that's why (47:27 - 47:30)
you get sick fades (47:28 - 47:32)
with raw denim jeans where in a (47:30 - 47:33)
tradition or (47:32 - 47:36)
current modern dyeing process (47:33 - 47:39)
it does die the fiber completely through (47:36 - 47:40)
so you're not going to get (47:39 - 47:42)
the same kind of fades as you do with (47:40 - 47:44)
raw denim that levi stuff was really (47:42 - 47:45)
overpriced (47:44 - 47:48)
the pokemon tax was high well it's the (47:45 - 47:49)
levi's tax (47:48 - 47:51)
and the book monday you had two taxes (47:49 - 47:53)
going in that was never going to be (47:51 - 47:54)
cheap (47:53 - 47:55)
and it was also not available at the (47:54 - 47:57)
levi's store at the mall of america i (47:55 - 47:58)
checked (47:57 - 48:00)
because you know i hate to buy stuff off (47:58 - 48:02)
the internet hey how was how busy was (48:00 - 48:03)
the mall america when you went (48:02 - 48:06)
when which time yeah (48:03 - 48:08)
it was there was it was me and greg it (48:06 - 48:10)
was not not particularly busy it wasn't (48:08 - 48:10)
that busy (48:10 - 48:13)
all right we we easily got parking right (48:10 - 48:14)
next to each other (48:13 - 48:17)
you parked in the past no (48:14 - 48:20)
no we parked in hawaii dude park in (48:17 - 48:21)
hawaii (48:20 - 48:23)
yeah so because you could park in hawaii (48:21 - 48:24)
normally you have to go (48:23 - 48:26)
because nevada's the fifth level i mean (48:24 - 48:28)
i'm always in the valley (48:26 - 48:31)
usually one through four is pretty (48:28 - 48:31)
packed (48:31 - 48:33)
but when we were there last there was (48:31 - 48:35)
space in one and two (48:33 - 48:38)
so we got to choose hawaii (48:35 - 48:40)
yes and we were able to park next to (48:38 - 48:42)
each other which really tells you that (48:40 - 48:44)
there were enough spaces available (48:42 - 48:46)
that there were two spaces thanks to (48:44 - 48:47)
each other (48:46 - 48:49)
near the walkway to get to the entrance (48:47 - 48:51)
we like walked outside in sub-zero (48:49 - 48:52)
temperature for like a minute (48:51 - 48:55)
at best all right some other news here (48:52 - 48:56)
is it's (48:55 - 48:59)
kind of an ad i guess because i was sent (48:56 - 49:01)
well it ultimately is an ad because i (48:59 - 49:02)
was sent the glasses and (49:01 - 49:06)

the kids also comes with a rotom phone (50:34 - 50:39)
case they're priced between 100 to 140 (50:37 - 50:40)

direct link i also have a discount code (50:42 - 50:46)
which is pkmncass you can save 15 (50:44 - 50:48)
off your order that's the ad part of (50:46 - 50:50)
this but i like the glasses (50:48 - 50:52)
i don't wear glasses it's funny how many (50:50 - 50:53)
people (50:52 - 50:55)
are like wow steve i've never seen you (50:53 - 50:57)
in glasses before yes because i don't (50:55 - 50:57)
wear (50:57 - 50:59)
glasses but don't you have a (50:57 - 51:00)
prescription for glasses (50:59 - 51:02)
i don't know i've never done i've never (51:00 - 51:04)
needed glasses i don't have contacts (51:02 - 51:07)
i was born with perfect vision will i (51:04 - 51:10)
mean we were all born with persecution (51:07 - 51:10)
um jen's does offer like a blue light (51:12 - 51:17)
i know some people really really i think (51:16 - 51:19)
you like the blue light right greg (51:17 - 51:21)
yeah it stopped me from getting (51:19 - 51:22)
headaches because i work in front of a (51:21 - 51:23)
bright computer all day (51:22 - 51:26)
um so i got the blue light on mine uh (51:23 - 51:27)
and then when i asked people because (51:26 - 51:29)
again i've never purchased a pair of (51:27 - 51:30)
glasses (51:29 - 51:33)
i was like is is 140 a lot for (51:30 - 51:35)
a pair of glasses and everyone i talked (51:33 - 51:36)
to said it that was a great price and (51:35 - 51:37)
they were super super (51:36 - 51:41)
40 is actually a great price (51:37 - 51:43)
the black glasses that you traditionally (51:41 - 51:44)
see me wearing with the thick black (51:43 - 51:46)
frames were four hundred dollars (51:44 - 51:49)
yeah jeez and they're not even snorlax (51:46 - 51:52)
my glasses i mean again the the (51:49 - 51:54)
the frames aren't the expensive part for (51:52 - 51:56)
me is the lenses (51:54 - 52:00)
i usually buy around a 200 frame so (51:56 - 52:00)
they're (52:00 - 52:02)
they're a little less than what i (52:00 - 52:04)
normally play but then you know they get (52:02 - 52:05)
close to a thousand dollars when they (52:04 - 52:07)
have to add in (52:05 - 52:09)
my prescription and the bifocal and all (52:07 - 52:10)
and all the things (52:09 - 52:13)
my biggest problem with gins is i tried (52:10 - 52:14)
on all their glasses and i looked (52:13 - 52:17)
terrible in all of them what are you (52:14 - 52:20)
impossible (52:17 - 52:22)
a lot of the pokemon ones are round and (52:20 - 52:24)
i have a very round face oh you got to (52:22 - 52:25)
go to the kanto ones they're more sweet (52:24 - 52:26)
yeah (52:25 - 52:30)
but i don't like uh the kanto ones were (52:26 - 52:33)
okay but they were a little small (52:30 - 52:34)
because i also have a big face i have a (52:33 - 52:37)
big head where are you trying these on (52:34 - 52:40)
you can have a virtual triangle (52:37 - 52:43)
so it's not 100 true also i don't need (52:40 - 52:44)
new glasses (52:43 - 52:47)
but if jen's is still going on when i (52:44 - 52:48)
have my next (52:47 - 52:50)
eye appointment because i usually have (52:48 - 52:51)
to get glasses (52:50 - 52:53)
every two years because my eyes (52:51 - 52:55)
deteriorate because i'm old (52:53 - 52:57)
same i might consider getting those but (52:55 - 53:00)
i want to be able to try on the frames (52:57 - 53:03)
actually in person (53:00 - 53:03)
yes physical locations i don't think so (53:03 - 53:08)
but i'm wondering if i can be like can (53:06 - 53:10)
you send me frames (53:08 - 53:12)
they do have a they do have i i did (53:10 - 53:13)
check some because somebody asked about (53:12 - 53:15)
the return policy um they do have like a (53:13 - 53:15)
30 day (53:15 - 53:17)
like no questions asked return policy as (53:15 - 53:19)
long as it's not with a prescription (53:17 - 53:21)
once yeah once you add a prescription to (53:19 - 53:23)
it then you can't return it (53:21 - 53:25)
so i probably would want to like get (53:23 - 53:26)
frames (53:25 - 53:29)
that i think would look good on my face (53:26 - 53:30)
try them on (53:29 - 53:32)
and then see if they are good if they (53:30 - 53:33)
are send those back and say okay here's (53:32 - 53:35)
my full prescription (53:33 - 53:37)
because my prescription is pretty bad (53:35 - 53:38)
but overall there's a lot of cute (53:37 - 53:40)
glasses (53:38 - 53:42)
there's just a lot of roundy glasses (53:40 - 53:44)
because that's more in style again (53:42 - 53:46)
i do like the johto glasses like that (53:44 - 53:49)
cyndaquil model (53:46 - 53:51)
yeah i was just surprised the pokemon (53:49 - 53:53)
tax wasn't like uh (53:51 - 53:56)
yeah the levi attacks the pokemon levi's (53:53 - 53:57)
those things were (53:56 - 53:59)
out of my budget for sure i don't know i (53:57 - 54:00)
was hoping to get something more (53:59 - 54:02)
athletic the next time i got glasses (54:00 - 54:05)
but boy oh boy yeah you see how all the (54:02 - 54:08)
jojo ones are so roundy (54:05 - 54:10)
the only ones that i think look that (54:08 - 54:11)
could (54:10 - 54:14)
look good is the kanto region model (54:11 - 54:17)
yeah i wish they had a uh wait (54:14 - 54:21)
they don't have a johto region model no (54:17 - 54:23)
even though it says johto region model (54:21 - 54:25)
that's so weird (54:23 - 54:27)
and like the snorlax classes are also (54:25 - 54:30)
very they're all very rounded they (54:27 - 54:32)
i do much better with a flat sort of (54:30 - 54:33)
flatter top (54:32 - 54:35)
yeah what i would like to get is pretty (54:33 - 54:37)
much exactly what i currently have (54:35 - 54:39)
just with pokemon on it yeah (54:37 - 54:42)
[Laughter] (54:39 - 54:43)

though you can always message me on (54:43 - 54:46)
twitter or instagram and i can try to (54:45 - 54:47)
answer them (54:46 - 54:49)

um let's jump to question of the week as (55:03 - 55:06)
that wraps it (55:05 - 55:09)
up for our pokemon news ooh what's the (55:06 - 55:10)
question (55:09 - 55:13)
of the week ooh what's the question (55:10 - 55:17)
of the week (55:13 - 55:17)
this is from the week is what song was (55:18 - 55:21)
that (55:20 - 55:24)
this is from al we all know al i don't (55:21 - 55:27)
have to say like alfred (55:24 - 55:27)
with a week of pokemon announcements (55:27 - 55:31)
upcoming (55:30 - 55:32)
what is the one thing you are pretty (55:31 - 55:34)
confident won't happen (55:32 - 55:36)
obviously there should be limited things (55:34 - 55:38)
that are being uh thrown about as (55:36 - 55:39)
suggestions (55:38 - 55:42)
not like pokemon being sold to apple i (55:39 - 55:44)
don't think they're announcing a new gen (55:42 - 55:45)
yeah are people do people really think (55:44 - 55:48)
that yeah (55:45 - 55:50)
some reason my brain just went to a (55:48 - 55:51)
whole other planet while you were (55:50 - 55:52)
talking (55:51 - 55:53)
well me because i didn't do it in a (55:52 - 55:55)
scottish accent (55:53 - 55:57)
uh with a week of pokemon announcements (55:55 - 55:58)
coming (55:57 - 55:59)
what is one thing you're pretty (55:58 - 56:03)
confident will not happen uh a week of (55:59 - 56:04)
pokemon announcements they will announce (56:03 - 56:05)
everything (56:04 - 56:08)
at the end of the day those were their (56:05 - 56:09)
words they did say (56:08 - 56:12)
we're gonna have week-long announcements (56:09 - 56:16)
what is not going to be announced i mean (56:12 - 56:17)
a pokemon burger king collaboration (56:16 - 56:20)
that's pretty clear (56:17 - 56:20)
i uh uh yeah i get i (56:21 - 56:27)
why would they announce gen 9 that would (56:24 - 56:28)
be yeah (56:27 - 56:31)
i mean where we're we're early for it (56:28 - 56:34)
but that doesn't people people saying oh (56:31 - 56:36)
certain shields are already so it's been (56:34 - 56:37)
out for so long (56:36 - 56:39)
they're going to do the next gen or (56:37 - 56:40)
they're going to announce the next gen (56:39 - 56:42)
that's coming in (56:40 - 56:44)
two years or whatever they they (56:42 - 56:45)
announced uh (56:44 - 56:48)
pokemon x and y in either february or (56:45 - 56:49)
march (56:48 - 56:52)
um that's true and then that came out in (56:49 - 56:53)
october (56:52 - 56:55)
that is true i wouldn't say it's early (56:53 - 56:57)
for that announcement to come out (56:55 - 57:00)
i would i mean like i guess i could see (56:57 - 57:02)
the thought process of like they (57:00 - 57:02)
announced (57:02 - 57:04)
and released sun and moon during the (57:02 - 57:05)
20th anniversary this is a pretty big (57:04 - 57:07)
deal it's 25. (57:05 - 57:10)
i guess i could kind of follow the logic (57:07 - 57:12)
this is the 15th anniversary (57:10 - 57:15)
of diamond and pearl so i feel like the (57:12 - 57:16)
obvious (57:15 - 57:18)
and what everyone wants is diamond and (57:16 - 57:20)
pro remakes (57:18 - 57:23)
yeah i i have i i will say that i'm (57:20 - 57:25)
fairly confident they will announce (57:23 - 57:26)
those remakes (57:25 - 57:27)
i might alternate that to say that they (57:26 - 57:29)
will do a platinum remake and not have (57:27 - 57:31)
it be (57:29 - 57:33)
two games no there's no way they don't (57:31 - 57:34)
do two games (57:33 - 57:36)
they're not gonna they're not gonna skip (57:34 - 57:39)
on that money uh ever since like they (57:36 - 57:41)
well i mean they did emerald they did (57:39 - 57:42)
crystal they did (57:41 - 57:45)
platinum but then they also just (57:42 - 57:47)
straight up did ultrasound ultramoon (57:45 - 57:50)
which is the same game true true feel (57:47 - 57:51)
like we're always going to be living in (57:50 - 57:53)
a two-game world (57:51 - 57:55)
uh i'm confident they're not gonna do (57:53 - 57:58)
dlc i'd for sword and shield (57:55 - 58:00)
in the center like i should i should i (57:58 - 58:01)
should put an asterisk of paid (58:00 - 58:04)
dlc i could see them adding like a free (58:01 - 58:07)
update to everyone or maybe i just want (58:04 - 58:09)
a free update to everyone of like (58:07 - 58:10)
what are they gonna update you know add (58:09 - 58:12)
following pokemon to the original wild (58:10 - 58:13)
area (58:12 - 58:16)
what if they do three games yeah i'm (58:13 - 58:19)
waiting for the day for them to do this (58:16 - 58:19)
i really believe that's in the future i (58:19 - 58:24)
just don't see how you (58:22 - 58:27)
sell more dlc after you've already done (58:24 - 58:28)
dlc with (58:27 - 58:31)
40 some legendary pokemon yeah (58:28 - 58:33)
i don't i don't think there's more dlc (58:31 - 58:36)
the game is missing 260 pokemon but (58:33 - 58:38)
the first two dlcs only added a hundred (58:36 - 58:40)
pokemon each (58:38 - 58:42)
so even if they did two more dlcs (58:40 - 58:43)
there's they're still technically 60 (58:42 - 58:45)
pokemon short i guess you could say like (58:43 - 58:47)
okay both these dlcs have (58:45 - 58:49)
130 and 130 and now we have them all i (58:47 - 58:51)
just don't see how you go like man in (58:49 - 58:52)
this dlc you can catch (58:51 - 58:55)
lugia you can catch oh you can catch (58:52 - 58:57)
necrozma and they're like this new dlc (58:55 - 59:01)
you can catch beedrill and clam pearl (58:57 - 59:03)
it's just not it's it's very hard to (59:01 - 59:05)
follow up like (59:03 - 59:08)
40 legends with kind of a bunch of (59:05 - 59:10)
reject pokemon at this point (59:08 - 59:12)
i'm sorry to like the one person that (59:10 - 59:14)
like loves bee drill and has a b drill (59:12 - 59:14)
tattoo (59:14 - 59:16)
but i don't think beedrill and like clam (59:14 - 59:19)
pearl are like strong enough (59:16 - 59:20)
you could maybe make the argument that (59:19 - 59:22)
that greninja would would maybe move (59:20 - 59:23)
some copies (59:22 - 59:25)
people do really like greninja a whole (59:23 - 59:27)
lot this is true (59:25 - 59:29)
yeah i would love to be wrong on that (59:27 - 59:31)
though like like if they i like i'm not (59:29 - 59:32)
done with sword and shield i love sword (59:31 - 59:34)
and shield i like it a whole lot so (59:32 - 59:36)
i mean i i still don't think that (59:34 - 59:38)
they're going to add a dlc that (59:36 - 59:42)
is cinna remakes to sword and shield oh (59:38 - 59:44)
i don't think that (59:42 - 59:45)
that that definitely ain't happening if (59:44 - 59:46)
they're putting out a region they're (59:45 - 59:49)
charging 60 bucks for it (59:46 - 59:51)
absolutely they're gonna make a new game (59:49 - 59:52)
for that one (59:51 - 59:54)
yeah i don't think there's more dlc for (59:52 - 59:55)
sword and shield (59:54 - 59:58)
i think most likely there's going to be (59:55 - 60:00)
the remakes coming out and then next (59:58 - 60:01)
year they announce what the (60:00 - 60:04)
gen 9 game is yeah (60:01 - 60:07)
yeah or we're not getting remakes and (60:04 - 60:09)
they just announced a new game (60:07 - 60:12)
i don't think if they re what what do (60:09 - 60:12)
you think (60:12 - 60:14)
you're pretty confident it won't happen (60:12 - 60:16)
i'm pretty confident (60:14 - 60:19)
that if it is a remake dynamaxx will be (60:16 - 60:20)
in it (60:19 - 60:21)
they're going to carry that through (60:20 - 60:23)
until gennady well yeah i mean they did (60:21 - 60:25)
the same thing with megas (60:23 - 60:28)
yeah i don't see how they cut dynomax (60:25 - 60:31)
no i mean not not for this universe (60:28 - 60:32)
right no yeah yeah they will eventually (60:31 - 60:33)
cut dynamax (60:32 - 60:34)
because they will move on to the next (60:33 - 60:36)
gimmick and i don't know why pokemon (60:34 - 60:38)
fans can't wrap their head around this (60:36 - 60:39)
like mario games and zelda games have (60:38 - 60:41)
been doing it for years like in this (60:39 - 60:42)
mario game (60:41 - 60:44)
he has a water pack they took it away in (60:42 - 60:46)
this mario game he goes to space they (60:44 - 60:48)
took that away and this mario game has a (60:46 - 60:48)
cat suit (60:48 - 60:51)
it's because we want pokemon to be (60:48 - 60:53)
better than that (60:51 - 60:57)
word and we're continually proven wrong (60:53 - 60:59)
do you i okay i also don't think they're (60:57 - 61:01)
gonna (60:59 - 61:02)
i don't think they're gonna show any new (61:01 - 61:04)
pokemon like (61:02 - 61:06)
oh no this is not the time for new (61:04 - 61:08)
pokemons (61:06 - 61:09)
i don't know they kind of drop melton (61:08 - 61:11)
out of nowhere that was also not the (61:09 - 61:13)
time for new pokemon (61:11 - 61:13)
[Music] (61:13 - 61:16)
[Laughter] (61:13 - 61:18)
i'm confident there probably won't be a (61:16 - 61:19)
new mobile game (61:18 - 61:23)
we have we have sleep we have unite (61:19 - 61:26)
sleep doesn't exist well you're right (61:23 - 61:28)
but i like i'm confident there won't be (61:26 - 61:30)
some random new pokemon game out of (61:28 - 61:31)
nowhere (61:30 - 61:33)
i think we got sleep we got unite we got (61:31 - 61:35)
masters we got go (61:33 - 61:36)
but that being said i want to be wrong (61:35 - 61:38)
on that too i would i'm not gonna say no (61:36 - 61:41)
to like shuffle three (61:38 - 61:43)
[Laughter] (61:41 - 61:45)
i don't think we hear anything about (61:43 - 61:47)
detective pikachu two the movie (61:45 - 61:50)
um the game yes but i don't think i (61:47 - 61:51)
don't think they're ready i (61:50 - 61:52)
because i don't think they're ready for (61:51 - 61:54)
a movie at all (61:52 - 61:56)
even though there was rumors that they (61:54 - 61:57)
signed for (61:56 - 62:00)
a sequel i mean that's fine it still (61:57 - 62:01)
takes years to make a movie especially (62:00 - 62:03)
in this day and age (62:01 - 62:05)
i talk about the the one thing i want (62:03 - 62:07)
that will probably not happen (62:05 - 62:11)
yeah a brand new tcgo client (62:07 - 62:14)
no that would not yeah that's true that (62:11 - 62:15)
won't happen (62:14 - 62:17)
that's that's never going to happen (62:15 - 62:19)
that's the thing i want the most (62:17 - 62:22)
pokemon tcg on the iphone not just the (62:19 - 62:23)
ipad (62:22 - 62:26)
i want that too but i i need a whole new (62:23 - 62:27)
client (62:26 - 62:30)
i need something to work they knew how (62:27 - 62:31)
much money that they would make (62:30 - 62:34)
if they would just port the tcg to the (62:31 - 62:35)
iphone (62:34 - 62:38)
man i have played card games on my (62:35 - 62:39)
iphone (62:38 - 62:41)
it's a terrible experience and yet i've (62:39 - 62:42)
still done it (62:41 - 62:44)
would probably also help if it was on (62:42 - 62:46)
switch that too (62:44 - 62:48)
uh pokemon of the week last week's (62:46 - 62:49)
pokemon i (62:48 - 62:52)
uh the difficulty level was set by the (62:49 - 62:54)
fact that it referenced a pokemon (62:52 - 62:56)
well first it talked about valentine's (62:54 - 62:58)
day which literally had (62:56 - 63:00)
next to nothing to do with the entire (62:58 - 63:01)
pokemon except (63:00 - 63:03)
i reference valentines which are kind of (63:01 - 63:05)
like letters (63:03 - 63:07)
but also difficulty level set by the (63:05 - 63:09)
fact that it referenced the pokemon that (63:07 - 63:10)
you only encounter in the post (63:09 - 63:14)
game of black and white so if you didn't (63:10 - 63:16)
get to the post game (63:14 - 63:19)
or you didn't do the post game like (63:16 - 63:20)
after defeating (63:19 - 63:23)
gets this the first time uh yeah you're (63:20 - 63:24)
not gonna know (63:23 - 63:25)
you're not gonna know what i was talking (63:24 - 63:28)
about but we had a pokemon who (63:25 - 63:30)
lost three grams and that scrams with a (63:28 - 63:33)
capital g because it's a held item (63:30 - 63:35)
and then you have to return them to that (63:33 - 63:37)
pokemon you can't then catch that (63:35 - 63:39)
pokemon but it does give you (63:37 - 63:43)
tm 89 which is u-turn (63:39 - 63:46)
as it flies away and then i also (63:43 - 63:47)
reference the fact (63:46 - 63:49)
that the pokemon's evolution is the mail (63:47 - 63:51)
carrier in pokemon mystery dungeon (63:49 - 63:55)
rescue team so which chat (63:51 - 63:59)
is it it's (63:55 - 64:02)
joe duo it's (63:59 - 64:06)
wingo thank you yeah doduo doesn't fly (64:02 - 64:08)
as far as it doesn't even have wings i (64:06 - 64:10)
mean it does learn fly (64:08 - 64:14)
it does learn fly dang probably (64:10 - 64:17)
the best pokemon shuffle icon (64:14 - 64:21)
it is so good wingle is (64:17 - 64:24)
an adorable often forgotten (64:21 - 64:26)
little sweetie of a pokemon no all of us (64:24 - 64:28)
are pico stans (64:26 - 64:30)
i do like pico's probably the best part (64:28 - 64:32)
about uh ruby sapphire (64:30 - 64:36)
well who's better than pico (64:32 - 64:39)
red gyarados wait is that in ruby and (64:36 - 64:41)
sapphire (64:39 - 64:43)
yeah you're thinking of the wrong game (64:41 - 64:45)
dag which is the one where they blow up (64:43 - 64:46)
the lake and then all the magikarps are (64:45 - 64:48)
like flopping around in there i mean (64:46 - 64:49)
that's a different game too that's (64:48 - 64:52)
diamond pearl wow (64:49 - 64:52)
i told you i'm i'm a whole other (64:52 - 64:55)
universe (64:54 - 64:57)
right now you guys have got me at the (64:55 - 64:58)
wrong (64:57 - 65:00)
pokemon best part of diamond and pearl (64:58 - 65:02)
though when they blow up the lincoln (65:00 - 65:03)
there's magikarp everywhere (65:02 - 65:06)
yeah now if they could have only blown (65:03 - 65:08)
up mount cornet (65:06 - 65:11)
it would have been a better game (65:08 - 65:11)
yeah it's like a good green it's one of (65:12 - 65:15)
the good green ones (65:14 - 65:18)
it's one of the good greens well only (65:15 - 65:20)
part of it is green right (65:18 - 65:22)
right yeah the blue turns it green yeah (65:20 - 65:24)
but then the rest stays white (65:22 - 65:26)
so it's still special do you have any (65:24 - 65:28)
wiggle trivia (65:26 - 65:30)
no it's just like wingle has the same (65:28 - 65:32)
speed and does (65:30 - 65:36)
not it's not very exciting (65:32 - 65:38)
winkle has the exact same base stats as (65:36 - 65:39)
taylor (65:38 - 65:41)
except for their attack and special (65:39 - 65:43)
attacker swapped i think that's (65:41 - 65:47)
important all right here we go sure (65:43 - 65:48)
this week's pokemon of the week that's (65:47 - 65:50)
going to be at jeopardy (65:48 - 65:52)
which pokemon does wingle swap stay (65:50 - 65:54)
anyway (65:52 - 65:54)
uh pikachu all right this week's pokemon (65:54 - 65:59)
of the week (65:58 - 66:01)
i am completely discombobulated someone (65:59 - 66:02)
on discord (66:01 - 66:04)
asked me to do this one it's another (66:02 - 66:06)
mythical from alola (66:04 - 66:08)
but not zeraora it was featured in a (66:06 - 66:09)
movie (66:08 - 66:11)
it takes no damage from normal or (66:09 - 66:13)
fighting type moves (66:11 - 66:15)
i used to be scared of the creature it (66:13 - 66:16)
is based on (66:15 - 66:19)
when i was camping as a cub scout (66:16 - 66:21)
there that's all the clues that you need (66:19 - 66:22)
boy did you write this or was this (66:21 - 66:24)
written to you by somebody else and (66:22 - 66:25)
you're reading it no (66:24 - 66:28)
i wrote this okay i just forgot to do (66:25 - 66:30)
pokemon of the week until three minutes (66:28 - 66:32)
before we started recording (66:30 - 66:34)
so i was like let me at least come up (66:32 - 66:36)
with six sentences that refer to a (66:34 - 66:37)
pokemon (66:36 - 66:41)
i i got it the answer is chat (66:37 - 66:45)
yeah spoilers well that's our episode (66:41 - 66:48)
hopefully you had a good canto tour fest (66:45 - 66:50)
i think it's called canto tour (66:48 - 66:52)
uh hopefully pokemon week will be good (66:50 - 66:54)
to you hopefully (66:52 - 66:56)
uh pikachu will bring you all the things (66:54 - 66:58)
that you ever wanted (66:56 - 67:02)
this week (66:58 - 67:02)
uh hopefully the scalpers didn't scalp (67:02 - 67:05)
the things that you (67:04 - 67:08)
wanted for yourself good luck finding (67:05 - 67:09)
and (67:08 - 67:10)
it turns out that pikachu was the (67:09 - 67:12)
scalper and then he gave everything out (67:10 - 67:15)
to all the good boys and girls (67:12 - 67:19)
as as gifts no he didn't (67:15 - 67:21)
no i know good luck finding shining (67:19 - 67:22)
fates (67:21 - 67:25)
i'm sure it will be sold out oh i know (67:22 - 67:26)
somebody who got two etbs i saw it on (67:25 - 67:27)
snapchat (67:26 - 67:31)
i'll be once i get back from (67:27 - 67:33)
minnesota uh on sunday night i'll be (67:31 - 67:35)
streaming on twitch (67:33 - 67:37)
uh pretty much all week i believe i will (67:35 - 67:39)
be streaming the (67:37 - 67:40)
post malone concert but i will be (67:39 - 67:42)
streaming in a way where (67:40 - 67:44)
you won't hear the audio and you won't (67:42 - 67:46)
see the video so you pull it up on your (67:44 - 67:48)
screen i'll have it muted uh (67:46 - 67:50)
on my screen because i do not want to be (67:48 - 67:52)
dmcad but i want to give you my thoughts (67:50 - 67:54)
as it is going live (67:52 - 67:58)
i do not trust anything music related on (67:54 - 68:00)
twitch (67:58 - 68:03)
uh but i think watching that concert (68:00 - 68:05)
with an audience will be more fun than (68:03 - 68:08)
sitting in my underwear watching it by (68:05 - 68:08)
myself (68:09 - 68:13)
[Music] (68:11 - 68:14)
