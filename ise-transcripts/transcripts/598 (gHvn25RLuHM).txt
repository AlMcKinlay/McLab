you Greg because recovery incense is a (5:29 - 5:35)
waste energy pillow a waste helper (5:31 - 5:38)
whistle a waste I think a Waste Recovery (5:35 - 5:41)
in sense isn't a Waste Recovery incense (5:38 - 5:42)
isn't a waste if you don't get good (5:41 - 5:44)

now get the easy travel ticket it's only (5:49 - 5:53)
100 get that you got to get that every (5:51 - 5:56)
month why because that lets you roll (5:53 - 5:59)
your Island if you have a bad Island at (5:56 - 6:01)
the start of a good event (5:59 - 6:05)
that's worth it this is a hot mean Roll (6:01 - 6:07)
My Island if I go so okay let's let's (6:05 - 6:10)
say there was like a a Christmas event (6:07 - 6:11)
or okay let's say there's a Valentine's (6:10 - 6:14)
event in Green Grass and you you go (6:11 - 6:15)
there and you have like the worst (6:14 - 6:18)
berries like you have like Rost and like (6:15 - 6:21)
whatever Berry that only like Gengar has (6:18 - 6:23)
and then whatever and there you're like (6:21 - 6:25)
oh I don't have three Pokemon to match (6:23 - 6:27)
those berries so you can use the easy (6:25 - 6:29)
travel and go back to green grass and (6:27 - 6:32)
it'll give you three new berries so you (6:29 - 6:35)
can opt that is a level that I will (6:32 - 6:39)
never it's only 100 it's it's it's it (6:35 - 6:41)
also requires me to look at the berries (6:39 - 6:44)
and know what my Pokemon do for berries (6:41 - 6:45)
look I just have my shinies out (6:44 - 6:47)
wandering on the island and I click them (6:45 - 6:50)
and I get food this is how I live my (6:47 - 6:53)
life and I still get better sleep than (6:50 - 6:54)
the both of you and I'm pretty sure I'm (6:53 - 6:56)
a higher rank I think you're a higher (6:54 - 6:58)
level than I am I'm looking at regular (6:56 - 7:00)
exchange and there's nothing nothing (6:58 - 7:02)
worth buying besides poke bis Pokeball (7:00 - 7:04)
biscuits and the easy travel and maybe (7:02 - 7:06)
like once in a while you're like ah I'll (7:04 - 7:08)
finally evolve that Eevee into Vaporeon (7:06 - 7:10)
if you go to the pre can you guys even (7:08 - 7:12)
see the premium store I mean I see the (7:10 - 7:15)

I I buy I buy all the pokeballs all the (7:21 - 7:26)
Great Balls every month and then I (7:23 - 7:28)
always buy subskill seed and Main skill (7:26 - 7:30)
seed so (7:28 - 7:32)
the fact that you have access to the sub (7:30 - 7:33)
skill seed and the main skill seed (7:32 - 7:37)
that's the real plus of Premium yeah I (7:33 - 7:38)
think I've bought them every month (7:37 - 7:40)
except the first month because I wasn't (7:38 - 7:42)
sure what they (7:40 - 7:44)
did and I was like oh I don't know if I (7:42 - 7:45)

of expensive are they but I don't I (7:45 - 7:51)
don't ever buy dream clusters or tickets (7:48 - 7:53)

have a chance of Bulbasaur Charmander (8:50 - 8:55)
Squirtle and Pikachu if you go to cyan (8:52 - 8:57)
Beach it's squirtle and Pikachu if you (8:55 - 9:00)
go to topollo Charmander (8:57 - 9:03)
and if you go to snow drop Tundra snow (9:00 - 9:06)
and Obama Snow the rates of these (9:03 - 9:09)
Pokemon have been greatly (9:06 - 9:12)
increased oh look at that crit protein (9:09 - 9:16)
shake baby we're getting swole now and (9:12 - 9:19)
look I haven't gotten a crit all week (9:16 - 9:21)
and I'm running the premium good (9:19 - 9:24)
ticket uh okay the other thing is people (9:21 - 9:28)
were upset that EV week wasn't as good (9:24 - 9:31)
as they expected and those people ended (9:28 - 9:34)
up going to Green Grass and when the the (9:31 - 9:36)
hardcore Pokemon sleep subreddit that (9:34 - 9:38)
like will ban you if you post a Shiny (9:36 - 9:39)
Pokemon because they have really weird (9:38 - 9:42)
rules there apparently they did (9:39 - 9:45)
re one of the rules no one of the rules (9:42 - 9:49)
on the Pokemon r r pookemon sleep one of (9:45 - 9:51)
the rules were you I think they I think (9:49 - 9:52)
they relaxed it a bit you weren't (9:51 - 9:54)
allowed to post your Shiny Pokemon (9:52 - 9:56)
because the admins there thought it (9:54 - 9:58)
would make people feel bad so they would (9:56 - 10:01)
delete your post so if you had a post (9:58 - 10:04)
that was like helpful and in the (10:01 - 10:06)
screenshot there was like a shiny in the (10:04 - 10:09)
background they would still delete it (10:06 - 10:11)
because that was violating a (10:09 - 10:14)
rule they thought you were like trying (10:11 - 10:18)
to so suddenly like shiny what is (10:14 - 10:21)
happening in this world uh they they (10:18 - 10:24)
then they did a week of no they they did (10:21 - 10:26)
a week of like we're going to test the (10:24 - 10:27)
if the shinies are okay and then it was (10:26 - 10:29)
just no it was nothing but post people (10:27 - 10:31)
flexing their shinies and then they like (10:29 - 10:32)
kind of relax (10:31 - 10:35)
anyways they actually did like uh they (10:32 - 10:37)
did like studies and they or whatever (10:35 - 10:40)
that the sil Road does like give me all (10:37 - 10:41)
your data we're going to analyze (10:40 - 10:43)
apparently if you didn't go to if you (10:41 - 10:46)
went to beach or taupe or whatever you (10:43 - 10:50)
got way more Eevees because green grass (10:46 - 10:54)
has more Pokemon in general oh I see so (10:50 - 10:56)
the people who got like shiny Eevee (10:54 - 10:58)
during Eevee week almost all of them (10:56 - 11:02)
were on like the beach or top Hollow so (10:58 - 11:03)
they didn't say if these Pokemon are (11:02 - 11:05)
going to be shiny I don't think so (11:03 - 11:05)
because they probably would have said it (11:05 - 11:07)
because they've they have been saying if (11:05 - 11:10)
shinies increase in sleep but they (11:07 - 11:12)
they're saying greater appearance so I'm (11:10 - 11:13)
I I'm assuming if you really want (11:12 - 11:15)
Charmander or you really want Squirtle (11:13 - 11:17)
or a good Charmander or a good Squirtle (11:15 - 11:19)
you should probably go to Canan Beach or (11:17 - 11:22)
topalo I don't know if snow is worth it (11:19 - 11:24)
also Snow drop is like really hard for a (11:22 - 11:26)
lot of people cuz the difficulty (11:24 - 11:28)
increases (11:26 - 11:30)
per Island (11:28 - 11:34)
okay so where are we going (11:30 - 11:36)
what I don't have a good (11:34 - 11:38)
Charmander (11:36 - 11:40)
interesting I (11:38 - 11:45)
have I have like a 98 Squirtle so you (11:40 - 11:45)
and your (11:45 - 11:47)
calculator I don't even know where the (11:45 - 11:50)
calculator is again I am not stressing (11:47 - 11:53)
my my sleep schedule okay (11:50 - 11:58)
also that thing lies like a like a (11:53 - 11:59)
filthy liar (11:58 - 12:02)
the sleep tracker the sleep tracker lies (11:59 - 12:05)
oh just a liar straight up it said I (12:02 - 12:08)

that bed because it's his favorite place (12:22 - 12:27)
to sleep that he does not move once he's (12:24 - 12:28)
there because he will not give up his (12:27 - 12:30)

here's here's the thing I will tell you (15:04 - 15:08)
my honestly when I look at that and it (15:06 - 15:09)
says here are the berries for this week (15:08 - 15:11)
and I go oh one of them matches that's (15:09 - 15:13)
like my bright moment of the start of (15:11 - 15:16)
the week like oh that'll be fun oh one (15:13 - 15:18)
out of the five match cool that'll be (15:16 - 15:21)
cute I wonder how that's going to go (15:18 - 15:24)
next let's get to sleep boys we got (15:21 - 15:26)
protein shakes to make I want to see my (15:24 - 15:28)
shiny Golem walking around dropping (15:26 - 15:30)
soybeans (15:28 - 15:33)
okay uh so last week I had uh last week (15:30 - 15:36)
was the Christmas week in sleep right (15:33 - 15:39)
and I I I was I was killing it in sleep (15:36 - 15:41)
except on Sunday I forgot to hit the (15:39 - 15:43)
button so it gave me an F cuz I missed (15:41 - 15:44)
one day so it was like instant F I (15:43 - 15:45)
probably would have actually got like a (15:44 - 15:48)
bat or something um and I woke up get (15:45 - 15:51)
that low I don't understand if you miss (15:48 - 15:53)
one day you're automatically F yeah I (15:51 - 15:55)
know I've SE I did I get I got one where (15:53 - 15:58)
the thing burned out where it cut out in (15:55 - 15:59)
the middle of the night and gave me an A (15:58 - 16:02)
and I was so mad yeah how dare you how (15:59 - 16:04)
dare you the reason it's because my (16:02 - 16:07)
midpoint never lines up literally the I (16:04 - 16:09)
looked back and the only time I ever got (16:07 - 16:11)
a I've gotten it once since this game (16:09 - 16:13)
has come out was when I was going to bed (16:11 - 16:17)
at 800 a.m. and I was waking up at 4: (16:13 - 16:19)
for a week straight I was so tired I was (16:17 - 16:21)
working all night and I went to bed at 8 (16:19 - 16:23)
instantly fell asleep my midpoint lined (16:21 - 16:27)
up every day and they were like a and A+ (16:23 - 16:30)
here we go if if you miss one night it (16:27 - 16:33)
doesn't automatically give you an F it (16:30 - 16:36)
it like drops you like d though no I got (16:33 - 16:39)
an A you had an a for missing a day yep (16:36 - 16:41)
I I can show you every time I've missed (16:39 - 16:44)
one day and it's always like well yours (16:41 - 16:48)
is always F anyways no well D come on I (16:44 - 16:50)
get like I'm usually like a d d is (16:48 - 16:52)
passing hand have you gone to public (16:50 - 16:55)
school D is passing yes I went (16:52 - 17:00)
to I mean these are barely passing (16:55 - 17:04)
say is B's and C's get degrees that is (17:00 - 17:06)
that is the saying bees and C's get (17:04 - 17:10)
degrees D is not enough D is not yeah (17:06 - 17:15)
barely I how are you not look I don't (17:10 - 17:17)
understand how people don't get S weeks (17:15 - 17:20)
that's like you just sleep it gives you (17:17 - 17:22)
an S at the end of the week and you're (17:20 - 17:25)
like cool and then you grad up in ranks (17:22 - 17:27)
and look you two who are doing all of (17:25 - 17:30)
this hard work are of a lesser rank than (17:27 - 17:33)
this buddy right here so let's let's (17:30 - 17:35)
absorb those Life Choices for a moment (17:33 - 17:38)
pound a g Fuel and then instantly fall (17:35 - 17:40)
asleep gu I had way too much caffeine (17:38 - 17:43)
yesterday my guess is that because Steve (17:40 - 17:45)
is on premium Steve is probably the (17:43 - 17:47)
highest rank and I am probably the (17:45 - 17:50)
lowest rank because I sleep kind of mid (17:47 - 17:52)
but I also don't have (17:50 - 17:55)
premium I'm level (17:52 - 17:55)
39 what what are all our ranks (17:56 - 18:00)
may have a short episode today we're (18:01 - 18:05)
like at two hours into Pokemon sleep (18:03 - 18:08)
this is your fault no I'm I'm I like (18:05 - 18:09)
Pokemon sleep it's like one of my (18:08 - 18:14)
favorite games I'm I'm 39 okay yeah I'm (18:09 - 18:16)
I'm 30 it says right at the (18:14 - 18:21)
top under 37 almost 38 I'm like a (18:16 - 18:23)
Heartbeat Away from 38 that's what I (18:21 - 18:26)
thought so Steve because you get premium (18:23 - 18:28)
you're a higher level and Greg because (18:26 - 18:30)
you sleep so well you're a higher level (18:28 - 18:33)
and I have neither of (18:30 - 18:36)
those that's true yeah I I think like (18:33 - 18:38)
anyone I've talked to that has like a (18:36 - 18:40)
pretty good 9 to5 and like they leave (18:38 - 18:43)
stream they're like I'm going to bed and (18:40 - 18:45)
it's like wow it's like 8:00 like anyone (18:43 - 18:46)
who has like an actual like sleep (18:45 - 18:48)
schedule I feel like they kill it at (18:46 - 18:49)
this game because this game like (18:48 - 18:51)
punishes you if you're like I'm sleeping (18:49 - 18:53)
six hours here but then I'm going to (18:51 - 18:54)
take like a two hour nap but then I'm (18:53 - 18:56)
going to go eight hours here and then (18:54 - 19:00)
like five that's not get sleep schedule (18:56 - 19:02)
it's true it's not it's not okay so I I (19:00 - 19:05)
had really I had like the the like it (19:02 - 19:07)
was like red and everything and then (19:05 - 19:09)
like I was like all right here's my (19:07 - 19:12)
Pokemon and I and it showed a deli bird (19:09 - 19:14)
my first Deli bird and then I got a (19:12 - 19:17)
pincer and pincer is really rare and I (19:14 - 19:21)
was like cool um hopefully one of them (19:17 - 19:24)
is hungry because I I'll use my premium (19:21 - 19:26)
biscuit and then I have like uh like Pok (19:24 - 19:28)
balls or whatever they both ended up (19:26 - 19:31)
being being hungry which is like crazy (19:28 - 19:32)
because usually it's like oh you have (19:31 - 19:35)
like five ekin and a and a good Pokemon (19:32 - 19:37)
the ekin are going to be hungry and I (19:35 - 19:39)
don't need any more ekins so I was like (19:37 - 19:42)
okay um I used my premium on the hair (19:39 - 19:46)
the the the pincer and then I needed (19:42 - 19:47)
like one great ball and I was like cool (19:46 - 19:49)
and then I went over to the deli bird (19:47 - 19:50)
and I was like okay I don't want to (19:49 - 19:52)
master ball it because it's hungry that (19:50 - 19:54)
doesn't make sense and I was like I'll (19:52 - 19:57)
just great ball it and then maybe great (19:54 - 19:58)
ball it one more time and I go I go to (19:57 - 20:01)
the the premium store and apparently I (19:58 - 20:03)
bought all the Great Balls for the the (20:01 - 20:04)
month and the premium store resets like (20:03 - 20:06)
today as we're recording and I was like (20:04 - 20:08)
ah that sucks so I went into the free (20:06 - 20:10)
store you guys don't in The Peasant (20:08 - 20:13)
store no we don't you guys don't get (20:10 - 20:17)
Great Balls it's what not even at like a (20:13 - 20:19)
a big Point Surplus because I think a (20:17 - 20:21)
great ball in the the the premium store (20:19 - 20:24)
is like what like 200 or three I don't (20:21 - 20:27)
know what it is um but I bought them all (20:24 - 20:30)
so the only way to get more Great Balls (20:27 - 20:33)
is to actually spend money for them is (20:30 - 20:37)
to use gems yeah so I I bought $10 worth (20:33 - 20:39)
of gems because like the Great Balls (20:37 - 20:42)
were like $3 or whatever and I bought (20:39 - 20:44)
Great Balls to get the deli bird and (20:42 - 20:47)
luckily enough it didn't get full (20:44 - 20:51)
but I I think the psychology for me was (20:47 - 20:55)
like because it was hungry it it didn't (20:51 - 20:56)
make any sense for me to buy a master (20:55 - 20:58)
ball and if it wasn't I prob probably (20:56 - 20:59)
would have got a master ball and then I (20:58 - 21:01)
wouldn't have spent real money but (20:59 - 21:02)
because it was (21:01 - 21:05)
hungry the great ball made sense cuz the (21:02 - 21:07)
great ball would be nine points and I (21:05 - 21:09)
think Del bird is this Bobby level logic (21:07 - 21:12)
right now yeah yeah you absolutely have (21:09 - 21:15)
enough to got Master yeah I could get (21:12 - 21:17)
three master balls right now but I (21:15 - 21:18)
didn't want to waste the master ball on (21:17 - 21:22)
a Pokemon that was hungry that was the (21:18 - 21:24)
that if you're watching on (21:22 - 21:28)
YouTube would you comment if you thought (21:24 - 21:29)
you (21:28 - 21:31)
everyone on threads threads are very (21:29 - 21:34)
everyone on thread's very nice uh except (21:31 - 21:35)
those LinkedIn people they need I have (21:34 - 21:38)
his robots on threads right now I don't (21:35 - 21:40)
everyone keeps are like my I I I don't (21:38 - 21:43)

threads now is like people that are like (21:43 - 21:49)
I work 800 hours a week Bal myself up by (21:45 - 21:50)
the (21:49 - 21:52)
bootstraps you get those because you (21:50 - 21:54)
keep interacting with them and telling (21:52 - 21:55)
them to go back to (21:54 - 21:58)
l i okay that's true I do I do call (21:55 - 22:00)

course I get followed by seven robots a (22:05 - 22:10)
day on threads no (22:08 - 22:14)
kidding okay uh I I the deli bird was (22:10 - 22:17)
worth $6 it it was worth $6 only because (22:14 - 22:21)
my calculator Hannah told me it was a (22:17 - 22:24)
98% your calculator tells you everything (22:21 - 22:25)
is a (22:24 - 22:29)
98% I agree with here (22:25 - 22:32)
98% every time anything can be a 98% (22:29 - 22:34)
when you have the sub skill seeds that's (22:32 - 22:35)
not (22:34 - 22:41)
true no % refers to and I don't want to (22:35 - 22:44)
it doesn't it no it's not I just have my (22:41 - 22:46)

Pokemon sleep watch out those were you (27:28 - 27:34)

Meloetta but I don't care as much (28:13 - 28:18)

Meloetta uh me the other one Meloetta so (28:23 - 28:32)
other Neo Champion is Nate is it Nate (28:28 - 28:34)
was it Nate yeah Nate (28:32 - 28:38)
Nate that's the other Neo Champion so (28:34 - 28:41)
they released them two weeks apart for (28:38 - 28:43)
reasons I don't know why they releas two (28:41 - 28:44)
weeks (28:43 - 28:47)
apart um but those are the two new neoch (28:44 - 28:50)
Champions and (28:47 - 28:53)
look neoch Champions is a master thing (28:50 - 28:55)
they kind of explained it in the story (28:53 - 28:57)
but not really it doesn't make a lot of (28:55 - 28:58)
sense (28:57 - 29:00)
but it's a way they can put them in new (28:58 - 29:03)
outfits that are cute and I'm all for it (29:00 - 29:06)
like the Neo Champion storyline it's (29:03 - 29:10)
like okay so like literally like they (29:06 - 29:11)
say a bunch of Gym Leaders came together (29:10 - 29:13)

everybody up for for happy fun (31:29 - 31:35)
times all right uh well let's take a (31:32 - 31:38)
quick break uh when we come back we have (31:35 - 31:41)
some Scarlet Violet stuff some Pokemon (31:38 - 31:44)
Go stuff and Pokemon concierge came out (31:41 - 31:46)
and apparently uh Everyone likes it so (31:44 - 31:50)
we will be right back and we are back (31:46 - 31:51)
from our (31:50 - 31:55)
break uh just a little bit of SV news (31:51 - 31:59)
here um hey there's like a bunch of when (31:55 - 32:00)
you're listening to this a bunch of (31:59 - 32:02)
mystery gifts that are expiring two (32:00 - 32:05)
important ones one is a shiny Lucario I (32:02 - 32:07)
believe that's January 3rd did we ever (32:05 - 32:12)
figure out why no no okay I was like I'm (32:07 - 32:15)
gonna watch pal and winds to see if it's (32:12 - 32:16)
in there and it it (32:15 - 32:20)
wasn't uh the other was a master ball (32:16 - 32:23)
that expires on January 3rd when I say (32:20 - 32:25)
expires I mean UTC time and I know time (32:23 - 32:27)
zones are hard for people so if you're (32:25 - 32:28)
listening to this and your switches (32:27 - 32:31)
nearby just just get both um my (32:28 - 32:34)
Instagram Twitter has like all the codes (32:31 - 32:37)
in little cute Graphics (32:34 - 32:39)
but get your shiny Lucario if you have (32:37 - 32:41)
two accounts get them on both accounts I (32:39 - 32:44)
don't know um walking wake and iron (32:41 - 32:48)
leaves uh end on Thursday again UTC time (32:44 - 32:51)
so it's probably like 6 PM central time (32:48 - 32:53)
if you have two accounts do it on both (32:51 - 32:56)
if you have both scarlet and violet just (32:53 - 32:59)
do it on both walk waken iron leaves are (32:56 - 33:02)
super sought after uh they're very high (32:59 - 33:03)
on the (33:02 - 33:06)
GTS they're not terribly hard to get I (33:03 - 33:09)
made a YouTube video on how you can get (33:06 - 33:14)
both of them relatively easy um four (33:09 - 33:17)
here's my like five minute raid rant uh (33:14 - 33:19)
walking awake is much easier just with I (33:17 - 33:22)
built like a Tentacruel it's it will (33:19 - 33:25)
never die it's super good it's tent like (33:22 - 33:26)
you can find everyone has a Tentacruel (33:25 - 33:27)
you probably played let's go Pikachu (33:26 - 33:29)
let's go Eevee just move it over or from (33:27 - 33:31)
Pokemon go fun fact John hanky of (33:29 - 33:34)
Pokemon go his favorite Pokemon is (33:31 - 33:36)
apparently Tentacruel that man's a liar (33:34 - 33:38)
I think but he said he has said multiple (33:36 - 33:40)
times his favorite Pokemon is tentac Gru (33:38 - 33:42)
people can like different Pokemon it's (33:40 - 33:45)
okay no they cannot I don't trust him (33:42 - 33:48)
there is a correct answer and I've been (33:45 - 33:50)
watching all of your little pictures (33:48 - 33:52)
that you've been putting up and all of (33:50 - 33:55)
you have been wrong it's not Tentacruel (33:52 - 33:59)
I'll tell you that much um silon (33:55 - 34:02)
for for something like uh iron leaves or (33:59 - 34:05)
any physical (34:02 - 34:07)
Pokemon I I get that some people might (34:05 - 34:09)
not have Nintendo online some people (34:07 - 34:11)
might not have friends or family to do (34:09 - 34:13)
these with some people what for whatever (34:11 - 34:16)
reason that you can't go online for (34:13 - 34:19)
physical Pokemon like an iron leaves or (34:16 - 34:22)
like a the rip perior or whatever you (34:19 - 34:26)
can reset the NPCs so there's no reason (34:22 - 34:28)
not in a physical raid not to have a (34:26 - 34:32)
staraptor or an Arcanine come it's it's (34:28 - 34:35)
why people like were able to do some of (34:32 - 34:37)
these like sevenstar physical Pokemon (34:35 - 34:40)
easier like cinderace is because uh when (34:37 - 34:41)
a when a computer dies you don't lose (34:40 - 34:44)
any time first like when a real player (34:41 - 34:47)
dies and so when Arcanine or staraptor (34:44 - 34:49)
keep dying over and over uh they come (34:47 - 34:51)
back in and they intimidate over and (34:49 - 34:54)
over and over again so uh I built an (34:51 - 34:57)
incinerar for iron leaves that you can (34:54 - 35:01)
do with friends or with um by yourself (34:57 - 35:02)
because it just happens to work and the (35:01 - 35:04)
great thing about incinerar is when you (35:02 - 35:05)
get that initial (35:04 - 35:08)
intimidate uh iron leaves no longer gets (35:05 - 35:10)
an attack boost instead it either gets a (35:08 - 35:11)
special defense boost or a speed boost (35:10 - 35:13)
depending on what nature it is because (35:11 - 35:14)
the natures are random when you go into (35:13 - 35:16)
this raid so that makes the raid easier (35:14 - 35:18)
if you're playing by yourself or if (35:16 - 35:19)
you're playing with other people because (35:18 - 35:23)
not having the what it called Proto (35:19 - 35:26)
boost or whatever whatever its ability (35:23 - 35:30)
is not having that activate to attack uh (35:26 - 35:32)
is much better (35:30 - 35:34)
than uh obviously special defense or (35:32 - 35:37)
speed doesn't matter that much so (35:34 - 35:40)
anyways you should get those done this (35:37 - 35:41)
is the third time they've come around (35:40 - 35:44)
the first time was broken technically (35:41 - 35:46)
because of the egg issue they had to (35:44 - 35:49)
come back uh and I don't know when (35:46 - 35:50)
they're coming back so you have till (35:49 - 35:52)
Thursday to do that don't procrastinate (35:50 - 35:54)
if you need help um if you're in our (35:52 - 35:56)
slack I know people are helpful there if (35:54 - 35:58)
you're in a disc people are helpful (35:56 - 36:00)
there uh I won't be streaming this week (35:58 - 36:03)
on Twitch so I can't help you but I (36:00 - 36:06)
posted a video so watch that if you (36:03 - 36:07)
don't know what to do they're very easy (36:06 - 36:10)
though if you just follow basic (36:07 - 36:14)
instructions just get them please I I (36:10 - 36:16)
don't we don't know when they're coming (36:14 - 36:18)
back that's the that's the scary part it (36:16 - 36:21)
could be another six (36:18 - 36:24)
months so get them um some new stuff (36:21 - 36:26)
there there there is a blueberry (36:24 - 36:28)
prologue featuring double battles uh (36:26 - 36:30)
registration will start later this week (36:28 - 36:32)
and then the tournament will be January (36:30 - 36:34)
12th through the 14th you will get (36:32 - 36:35)
10,000 League points if you complete (36:34 - 36:36)
three or more (36:35 - 36:39)
battles uh the rules of this is you can (36:36 - 36:42)
only use Pokemon caught in the blueberry (36:39 - 36:45)
Des decks uh so it's it's like a fun (36:42 - 36:47)
side tournament uh the one of the (36:45 - 36:49)
reasons we bring up these tournaments on (36:47 - 36:50)
the show Even though maybe a lot of (36:49 - 36:51)
people who listen aren't really (36:50 - 36:53)
competitive battle focused is cuz they (36:51 - 36:56)
are fun uh in the sense of like (36:53 - 36:57)
restricting the Pokédex (36:56 - 37:00)
of like you can't use like chenow or any (36:57 - 37:02)
of those cuz in this case they're not (37:00 - 37:05)
part of the blueberry (37:02 - 37:10)
decks neither is U but um the other (37:05 - 37:12)
thing is we've seen this with sun and (37:10 - 37:14)
moon and sword and shield is when they (37:12 - 37:17)
get near the end of these games there's (37:14 - 37:18)
usually these little tournament (37:17 - 37:20)
structures that then award a Shiny (37:18 - 37:23)
Pokemon so for Ultra Sun Ultra Moon it (37:20 - 37:25)
was the tapoos those were how you get (37:23 - 37:28)
them shiny and then for sword and shield (37:25 - 37:30)
shout out to the five people that (37:28 - 37:32)
comment on my video that my shiny Zapdos (37:30 - 37:35)
was hacked because they've never because (37:32 - 37:37)
it's been shiny locked no uh actually if (37:35 - 37:39)
you go to (37:37 - 37:41)
pokemon.com or you follow this podcast (37:39 - 37:43)
for any amount of time you would have (37:41 - 37:44)
known that at the end of sword and (37:43 - 37:47)
shield they gave out shiny garan Zapdos (37:44 - 37:50)
mol trce and Articuno all you had to do (37:47 - 37:52)
was do three battles you didn't have to (37:50 - 37:54)
win them you didn't you just had to you (37:52 - 37:56)
could go in with an electrode and (37:54 - 37:58)
self-destruct and lose do that three (37:56 - 37:59)
times and you would have gotten your (37:58 - 38:01)
shiny so in this case the rewards aren't (37:59 - 38:05)
that great it's just 10,000 leak points (38:01 - 38:08)
um but they've given backpacks before (38:05 - 38:11)
they've given shirts before there was no (38:08 - 38:12)
luxury ball shirt though for Greg (38:11 - 38:15)
unfortunately and S [ __ ] I don't even (38:12 - 38:18)
still (38:15 - 38:22)
angry so cruel and (38:18 - 38:22)
rude so if you want to try some (38:22 - 38:27)
blueberry Pokemon you can you can write (38:24 - 38:29)
register although I don't know if they (38:27 - 38:32)
fixed it I want to say at the beginning (38:29 - 38:34)
of this game I guess I'll tell you guys (38:32 - 38:36)
next week when you registered you had to (38:34 - 38:39)
lock in your team in scarlet and violet (38:36 - 38:40)
but in sword and shield when you (38:39 - 38:41)
registered you didn't have to lock in (38:40 - 38:42)
your team so I actually wonder if they (38:41 - 38:45)
fix that um because locking in your team (38:42 - 38:47)
for a whole week kind of sucks because (38:45 - 38:49)
then you can't use it for other (38:47 - 38:53)
things but my one comment is that I'm a (38:49 - 38:55)
little annoyed they're calling this (38:53 - 38:57)
competition a prologue when they have a (38:55 - 39:01)
story based epilog coming (38:57 - 39:04)
out yeah the EP called competitions (39:01 - 39:07)
prologue before but it still bothers me (39:04 - 39:12)
is the epilog the the S the 11th 7th (39:07 - 39:17)
11th Thursday okay uh nothing to really (39:12 - 39:18)
say there because they haven't announced (39:17 - 39:19)
anything but (39:18 - 39:22)
like be (39:19 - 39:25)
cautious uh Hannah said there was like (39:22 - 39:29)
some weird stuff with BBQs exactly where (39:25 - 39:32)
people can technically spoil the look (39:29 - 39:35)
The epilog is in the game right now like (39:32 - 39:38)
all you need to do is get like an item (39:35 - 39:40)
to unlock it just like archus and Shaman (39:38 - 39:43)
were in bdsp the entire time you just (39:40 - 39:45)
need an (39:43 - 39:50)
item so if people somehow get that item (39:45 - 39:52)
early from external means they can do (39:50 - 39:55)
whatever that epilog is I I don't know (39:52 - 39:58)
what it is but boy do people on Tik Tok (39:55 - 40:00)
like love to just start off spoiling it (39:58 - 40:02)
for you so just be very cautious if (40:00 - 40:05)
you're for whatever reason if you're (40:02 - 40:06)
like the story and you don't want it (40:05 - 40:08)
spoiled I don't again I don't know how (40:06 - 40:09)
big it is I don't exactly know what it's (40:08 - 40:11)
supposed to say or (40:09 - 40:15)
do but just you got 11 days to be (40:11 - 40:19)
cautious out there maybe also don't BBQ (40:15 - 40:21)
with completely random (40:19 - 40:24)
people how would you even I suppose (40:21 - 40:27)
Reddit and stuff yeah yeah there's like (40:24 - 40:29)
a there's like a subreddits dedicated (40:27 - 40:31)
how would you just R and then I I never (40:29 - 40:33)
mind I pieced it together if they had (40:31 - 40:35)
good moderators like the Pokemon sleep (40:33 - 40:39)
Reddit Greg then we wouldn't (40:35 - 40:39)
have no shiny's (40:40 - 40:46)
[Laughter] (40:42 - 40:46)
allow um there is supposed to be and the (40:48 - 40:53)
I think the last scarlet and violet news (40:51 - 40:55)
is there is supposed to be a (40:53 - 40:59)
3.0.1 update that update is to fix two (40:55 - 41:00)
things I think we talked about this last (40:59 - 41:04)
week the one is the the TM issue for (41:00 - 41:06)
scarlet players and then the other one (41:04 - 41:09)
was something oh the other one was the (41:06 - 41:11)
Inc (41:09 - 41:14)
thing yep did we talk about this last (41:11 - 41:18)
week yep what's the Inc thing if you (41:14 - 41:21)
give Inc rare candy or experience candy (41:18 - 41:25)
but only up to like TW like level 29 or (41:21 - 41:28)
something it's below 30 (41:25 - 41:32)
it will it will like soft lock your game (41:28 - 41:34)
whereas if you give in like 80 (41:32 - 41:37)
experience candy and you like go past 30 (41:34 - 41:41)
you're totally fine it's such a weird (41:37 - 41:44)
specific but it's only like if you were (41:41 - 41:47)
like taking your in from like 20 to 25 (41:44 - 41:48)
then it's which means you would have had (41:47 - 41:50)
to breed Inc first because you can't (41:48 - 41:53)
catch them that low at Blueberry at all (41:50 - 41:55)
yeah you have to have hatched it from an (41:53 - 41:58)
egg that is (41:55 - 42:00)
I transferred a shiny ink from go into (41:58 - 42:03)
Scarlet Violet and then I was because I (42:00 - 42:05)
was like I want to test Malamar with (42:03 - 42:08)
contrary and then I was like oh no and (42:05 - 42:10)
then everyone was like no no no if you (42:08 - 42:12)
just go to like level 95 you're totally (42:10 - 42:15)
fine and I was like okay I was F you (42:12 - 42:17)
still have do you still have to turn (42:15 - 42:20)
your switch upside down you do you do (42:17 - 42:24)
yes so if you're playing on your TV mhm (42:20 - 42:26)
do you have to run over and grab your (42:24 - 42:28)
switch (42:26 - 42:31)
yep so fun fact nightmare (42:28 - 42:33)
timeline if you're if you're if you're (42:31 - 42:36)
playing on your TV with and you need to (42:33 - 42:38)
evolve an Inc not only do you have to (42:36 - 42:39)
run up and get your switch you have to (42:38 - 42:42)
disconnect your Pro Controller because (42:39 - 42:44)
if your Pro Controller is connected it (42:42 - 42:47)
won't sense the joyc con's motion so (42:44 - 42:49)
when you flip it upside down it doesn't (42:47 - 42:50)
know that it's upside down so if you're (42:49 - 42:54)
having trouble evolving in a you need to (42:50 - 42:56)
disconnect your Pro Controller (42:54 - 42:57)
completely also the joycons have to be (42:56 - 43:00)
on the switch you can't just hold the (42:57 - 43:02)
joycons upside (43:00 - 43:05)
down it's Inc is uh there's there's (43:02 - 43:07)
going to be a game like the reason they (43:05 - 43:10)
did the deck cut is purely for like fur (43:07 - 43:12)
frus and Incas and all these things cuz (43:10 - 43:16)
like there's so many G like I'm sorry (43:12 - 43:18)
not every game can have a rock that you (43:16 - 43:20)
walk under with a sandstorm and you have (43:18 - 43:23)
four HP and then all of a sudden your y (43:20 - 43:25)
mask evolves into (43:23 - 43:29)
uez another rock to the (43:25 - 43:34)
game make it the Rune Rock the Rune Rock (43:29 - 43:37)
no okay can I play I I get why they do (43:34 - 43:40)
this but with duraladon so the way you (43:37 - 43:45)
evolve duraladon into Arch Arch Arch (43:40 - 43:46)
Arch whatever it's called what's it (43:45 - 43:49)
called Archie Arch audon Arch (43:46 - 43:53)
audon is an item called like (43:49 - 43:57)
metal metal support brush whatever it's (43:53 - 44:00)
it's literally metal coat that's all it (43:57 - 44:03)
is metal coat works for what like three (44:00 - 44:06)
Pokemon Steelix Scizor (44:03 - 44:08)
and I think that's it maybe there's (44:06 - 44:10)
another there's probably one more that (44:08 - 44:14)
iess is it is it Pine Cod or except it's (44:10 - 44:15)
not literally metal coat it's metal (44:14 - 44:18)
alloy yeah okay metal alloy metal coat (44:15 - 44:22)
it's the same item why are we in I'm (44:18 - 44:24)
this is what actually makes me mad you (44:22 - 44:26)
guys are talking about the wrong issues (44:24 - 44:29)
we don't need any more items in Pokémon (44:26 - 44:32)
to evolve things absolutely do I (44:29 - 44:33)
understand that the reason they couldn't (44:32 - 44:35)
do like metal coat is because (44:33 - 44:36)
technically in sword and shield there's (44:35 - 44:37)
metal coat and there's duraladon that (44:36 - 44:39)
would be weird and people would be (44:37 - 44:40)
confus (44:39 - 44:43)
no you've already made terrible choices (44:40 - 44:46)
in your game look at ekins and bdsp move (44:43 - 44:49)
you've already ruined a lot of things (44:46 - 44:53)
just make it metal coat it's fine we (44:49 - 44:55)
don't need the rec conet you already did (44:53 - 44:56)
like let's go Pikachu let's let's go (44:55 - 44:58)
Eevee where I can get a Magnemite but I (44:56 - 44:59)
can't get Magneton and I can't get a (44:58 - 45:02)
Pichu and I can't get the Magmortar or (44:59 - 45:04)
Espeon or any of those things you've (45:02 - 45:06)
already set these weird rules in your (45:04 - 45:10)
Universe we don't need one specific item (45:06 - 45:14)
to evolve one specific Pokemon anymore (45:10 - 45:16)
you have like Reaper Cloth it only works (45:14 - 45:19)
for dust no or whatever everything (45:16 - 45:20)
should be unique and special it is only (45:19 - 45:23)
for Steelix and caor there that's the (45:20 - 45:25)
only thing midle codes for look (45:23 - 45:27)
everybody deserves to have a special (45:25 - 45:29)
little item that makes them feel strong (45:27 - 45:31)
and powerful and I am not going to deny (45:29 - 45:34)
that to my sweet Pokemon as I have (45:31 - 45:36)
learned from the amazing Pokemon (45:34 - 45:40)
concierge series everybody has to have (45:36 - 45:42)
their own path to (45:40 - 45:46)
happiness if if derlon needs a metal (45:42 - 45:49)
alloy to feel like a princess at the (45:46 - 45:53)
ball let them have it let it happen I'm (45:49 - 45:56)
more than happy to let them have that (45:53 - 46:01)
special item and fail like a million (45:56 - 46:04)
bucks you know how they fix this they (46:01 - 46:06)
just give duraladon a move like dragon (46:04 - 46:08)
chear and they say oh you need metal (46:06 - 46:11)
coat an item that already exists and but (46:08 - 46:13)
you also need this move as well there (46:11 - 46:14)
that fixes the sword and shield issue (46:13 - 46:17)
because you can't get that move in that (46:14 - 46:20)
game uh we're not going to spoil Pokemon (46:17 - 46:22)
concierge because I know a lot of people (46:20 - 46:26)
haven't seen it uh so good it's what (46:22 - 46:28)
four episodes each episode's like 20 (46:26 - 46:31)
minutes yep uh it's made by dwarf (46:28 - 46:33)
Animation (46:31 - 46:33)
studio uh if you don't know what it's (46:35 - 46:39)
about this is off the verge.com set on a (46:37 - 46:41)
lush Island where the famed Pokemon (46:39 - 46:43)
Resort welcomes Pocket Monsters of all (46:41 - 46:45)
sizes and shapes (46:43 - 46:49)
and Si to to rest and recharge sizes and (46:45 - 46:51)
shapes to rest and recharge Pokemon (46:49 - 46:54)
concierge tells a story of a young woman (46:51 - 46:57)
named Haru uh who becomes the newest (46:54 - 46:59)
Resort employee after being dumped by (46:57 - 47:03)
her boyfriend oh I didn't know oh look (46:59 - 47:05)
it's a it's a whole thing it's like (47:03 - 47:08)
don't spoil don't spoil the series of (47:05 - 47:12)
tragedies that leads here to become a (47:08 - 47:12)
resort uh realizing that she isn't happy (47:12 - 47:17)
with the trajectory of her life Haru (47:15 - 47:19)
knows that she needs to shake things up (47:17 - 47:21)
understanding what it is about herself (47:19 - 47:23)
and what makes it easy for Haru to quit (47:21 - 47:26)
her old job and move to join the poke (47:23 - 47:28)
Resort as the (47:26 - 47:30)
concierge so that's kind of like the (47:28 - 47:35)
theme of it look if I could leave my (47:30 - 47:38)
life right now and go to an island to (47:35 - 47:40)
become a pocon concierge that's what I (47:38 - 47:44)
was gonna say I am selling everything I (47:40 - 47:47)
would also be up for this I am out I am (47:44 - 47:50)
I am out (47:47 - 47:54)
like I don't care she eats for free she (47:50 - 47:56)
stays for free there's no T of salary (47:54 - 47:59)
she just gets to live and exist it is (47:56 - 48:02)
the greatest Universe I want to be there (47:59 - 48:04)
I want this life for (48:02 - 48:07)
myself I watched the entire I watched (48:04 - 48:09)
the entire series and then I went to (48:07 - 48:12)
YouTube to watch the making of the (48:09 - 48:16)
series nice wait is that like on sorry (48:12 - 48:18)
Anna is that like a Netflix thing on (48:16 - 48:20)
YouTube of like the making of the series (48:18 - 48:21)
it was just in it's just YouTube the (48:20 - 48:23)
think the studio put down what they did (48:21 - 48:25)
to make it I don't know how they're (48:23 - 48:27)
related like I literally watched the (48:25 - 48:29)
series I went over to YouTube and it was (48:27 - 48:32)
like making of Pokemon carrot and like (48:29 - 48:35)
fire it up show me what you did show me (48:32 - 48:36)
all the faces you made for these (48:35 - 48:39)
incredible stopmotion things here's the (48:36 - 48:42)
thing my friend hates stop (48:39 - 48:45)
motion she she finds it creepy stop (48:42 - 48:48)
motion like Wallace and grommit yeah oh (48:45 - 48:51)
okay okay okay Wallace and grommit uh (48:48 - 48:54)
ParaNorman Coraline all oh I know (48:51 - 48:56)
Coraline all of those are stop motion (48:54 - 48:58)
they do a really really really really (48:56 - 49:02)
really good job uh like all the textures (48:58 - 49:04)
are really unique like it is just a (49:02 - 49:07)
gorgeous series I honestly had to wait (49:04 - 49:09)
for the credits to actually look and see (49:07 - 49:11)
and make sure it was stop motion and not (49:09 - 49:13)
just some very stylized animation (49:11 - 49:15)
because it was really hard to tell it's (49:13 - 49:17)
really hard to tell there's a lot of (49:15 - 49:19)
really great detail they put a lot of (49:17 - 49:21)
detail in the texturing of all the (49:19 - 49:25)
Pokémon models it is clearly beautifully (49:21 - 49:27)
made it was made with love it's not a (49:25 - 49:29)
huge commitment it's four episodes of (49:27 - 49:32)
literally 15 minutes each I watched it (49:29 - 49:35)
for an hour and I was like I what do you (49:32 - 49:38)
mean is done at four I would watch (49:35 - 49:40)
this (49:38 - 49:42)
forever yeah it's about an hour long all (49:40 - 49:45)
all things considered and it's it's (49:42 - 49:47)
longer than Hui and snow so it's a (49:45 - 49:49)
bigger commitment than Hui and snow not (49:47 - 49:52)
happening then I can't I can't you can't (49:49 - 49:55)
you can you just w i plan (49:52 - 49:57)
watching (49:55 - 50:00)
there are moment there's something (49:57 - 50:02)
weird (50:00 - 50:05)
about I think it's I think this is just (50:02 - 50:06)
me this has nothing to do with Pokemon (50:05 - 50:09)
or this just me being weird like I buy (50:06 - 50:12)
bottled water (50:09 - 50:16)
because I drink more water and people (50:12 - 50:17)
are like just buy a water bottle and get (50:16 - 50:20)
it from your fountain your little fridge (50:17 - 50:22)
or whatever but like the that doesn't (50:20 - 50:23)
work for me it didn't work for me (50:22 - 50:25)
growing up and the reason I drink more (50:23 - 50:27)
water is cuz I'm like oh I paid money (50:25 - 50:29)
for this I have to finish it whereas (50:27 - 50:31)
like I I guess technically I'm paying (50:29 - 50:33)
money for water I have a water bill but (50:31 - 50:36)
it's like not the same when things are (50:33 - 50:38)
on like Netflix or when things are on (50:36 - 50:42)
like YouTube like huian snow or whatever (50:38 - 50:44)
that one series was with like the six (50:42 - 50:46)
episodes for Galler that they did as (50:44 - 50:48)
well I mean there's also the four (50:46 - 50:49)
episodes they did for pal and wins it (50:48 - 50:51)
doesn't feel like a priority because (50:49 - 50:53)
it's just like ah we put up free content (50:51 - 50:55)
but now that I like resubscribe to (50:53 - 50:57)
Netflix specifically for this show and (50:55 - 50:59)
to also I wanted to see like the one (50:57 - 51:02)
piece thing also I guess I like one (50:59 - 51:04)
piece now I I will never watch the anime (51:02 - 51:06)
but like whatever that live action thing (51:04 - 51:08)
was I I really liked it the live action (51:06 - 51:10)
is so good so I watched the live action (51:08 - 51:11)
of One Piece I'm like I'm GNA go back (51:10 - 51:13)
and because I've been sort of half (51:11 - 51:15)
watching the (51:13 - 51:17)
anime you know the anime needs the (51:15 - 51:19)
editor that that they put into the live (51:17 - 51:21)
action one piece cuz I was like how are (51:19 - 51:23)
we still at this restaurant and I've (51:21 - 51:24)
been watching the animated series for (51:23 - 51:27)
literally 3 hours now and we have not (51:24 - 51:31)
left this restaurant that was like one (51:27 - 51:34)
episode in the live action in and out (51:31 - 51:37)
one and done much better experience so (51:34 - 51:40)
when I my Netflix is like I subscribe (51:37 - 51:42)
like for two months twice a year and (51:40 - 51:44)
when I subscribe I'm like I need to (51:42 - 51:46)
watch everything possible because I have (51:44 - 51:50)
a month so I'm like for YouTube premium (51:46 - 51:54)
I was gonna say yeah but you PR paying (51:50 - 51:57)
for Hing and snow I mean I guess I mean (51:54 - 51:59)
I guess I also use the Apple the YouTube (51:57 - 52:03)
music anyways so I I paid my $22 I plan (51:59 - 52:06)
to watch concer this weekend I watched (52:03 - 52:08)
one piece that was cool I finished (52:06 - 52:09)
disenchantment because I was like they (52:08 - 52:12)
did a season whatever and then I'm gonna (52:09 - 52:15)
cancel Netflix so two things here number (52:12 - 52:17)
one is uh I don't know I feel like (52:15 - 52:21)
obligated to it almost feels like it's a (52:17 - 52:24)
more important thing because it's on (52:21 - 52:26)
Netflix versus YouTube and I don't know (52:24 - 52:29)
that's just to me like it feels like (52:26 - 52:32)
like there's so many of these Pokemon 4 (52:29 - 52:34)
episode things that they've just put on (52:32 - 52:37)
YouTube so this is another Pokemon 4 (52:34 - 52:39)
episode thing but it's on Netflix which (52:37 - 52:44)
to me makes it feel like this is more (52:39 - 52:46)
important because it's behind a pay wall (52:44 - 52:49)
that's weird but it's it is behind a pay (52:46 - 52:51)
wall like you have to subscribe to get (52:49 - 52:54)
it yep no I understand the the logic (52:51 - 52:56)
there but also all of the animated (52:54 - 52:58)
shorts that are on YouTube are really (52:56 - 53:01)
good too just fantastic pieces of (52:58 - 53:04)
artwork made by people with fantastic (53:01 - 53:06)
stories about Pokemon (53:04 - 53:08)
so (53:06 - 53:11)
just they're all good I don't know like (53:08 - 53:14)
watch it all yeah but if if I only have (53:11 - 53:17)
time this weekend to watch huan Snow and (53:14 - 53:19)
concierge I feel like the easy answer is (53:17 - 53:21)
conier because I both are apparently (53:19 - 53:23)
really good both are probably the same (53:21 - 53:25)
length maybe the snow is a little bit (53:23 - 53:28)
shorter but like because one is behind (53:25 - 53:30)
an actual pay wall it feels like the (53:28 - 53:32)
Pokemon company feels like this is more (53:30 - 53:35)
important to sell it to Netflix and (53:32 - 53:37)
that's why it's behind obviously Netflix (53:35 - 53:39)
wants people to sign up because they (53:37 - 53:41)
want their money so that's the first (53:39 - 53:43)
thing it's just to me it feels more (53:41 - 53:46)
important um and I'm very glad that (53:43 - 53:48)
literally everyone has that watched it (53:46 - 53:50)
has said it's amazing so that's exciting (53:48 - 53:53)
1,000% the more important thing here (53:50 - 53:55)
this is the actual news of the episode (53:53 - 53:59)
net nli released Pokemon Netflix icons (53:55 - 54:04)
like 24 of them like furet Den Pikachu (53:59 - 54:08)
Psyduck Etc that in it like Netflix you (54:04 - 54:10)
want me to sign up you just don't even (54:08 - 54:12)
give me a Pokemon just give me a Pokemon (54:10 - 54:15)
icon I am here for you Netflix now the (54:12 - 54:18)
thing I've learned through research is (54:15 - 54:22)
is my D Netflix icon worth (54:18 - 54:25)
$22 absolutely it's worth way more than (54:22 - 54:27)
that $6 Deli bird that I caught will I (54:25 - 54:31)
lose my Denna icon from what my research (54:27 - 54:34)
is Netflix will remove icons apparently (54:31 - 54:37)
there was a Taylor Swift Netflix icon (54:34 - 54:40)
and you can no longer get it but as long (54:37 - 54:43)
as you never change your icon it will be (54:40 - 54:46)
there forever and if you've paused your (54:43 - 54:47)
Netflix they're not going to take it (54:46 - 54:49)
away from you so if you are like me and (54:47 - 54:51)
you've changed your icon to a good (54:49 - 54:54)
Pokemon like den den you can now never (54:51 - 54:56)
change your icon again because once (54:54 - 54:58)
these icons go away which they probably (54:56 - 55:00)
will in like six months uh once you (54:58 - 55:02)
change it you will lose it forever so (55:00 - 55:05)
that's the actual PSA of this episode (55:02 - 55:08)
Keep Your Den icon until Netflix is (55:05 - 55:09)
burned to the (55:08 - 55:14)
[Laughter] (55:09 - 55:16)
ground or Netflix is bought by somebody (55:14 - 55:18)
I don't (55:16 - 55:21)
know um yeah that was like the first (55:18 - 55:23)
thing I did I was like oh my gosh (55:21 - 55:25)
Pokemon icons yeah I immediately went (55:23 - 55:27)
and changed it to Bulbasaur and sent (55:25 - 55:28)
screenshots to other people who I (55:27 - 55:32)
thought may also want Pokemon icons Greg (55:28 - 55:33)
what is your what is your Pokemon what (55:32 - 55:35)
is your icon right now Netflix you got (55:33 - 55:38)
to change it I have no idea what my icon (55:35 - 55:43)
is in Netflix I could not tell (55:38 - 55:48)
you I have zero clue I don't even know I (55:43 - 55:51)
can tell you what it is for Disney plus (55:48 - 55:54)
because I have to select (55:51 - 55:56)
it do you do you you and your husband (55:54 - 55:58)
share a Netflix account you don't have (55:56 - 56:00)
like different profiles (55:58 - 56:02)
no (56:00 - 56:05)
oh I (56:02 - 56:07)
don't he watches I was going to say your (56:05 - 56:09)
husband doesn't seem like a Netflix kind (56:07 - 56:12)
of he watches shutter um doesn't he (56:09 - 56:14)
watch like ultimate bake off or (56:12 - 56:16)
whatever no I watch Great British Bake (56:14 - 56:19)
Off oh you watch it I watch Great (56:16 - 56:20)
British Bake (56:19 - 56:24)
Off uh he well so he watches shutter he (56:20 - 56:27)
watches look (56:24 - 56:29)
in the chaos that is happening at his (56:27 - 56:32)
desk I am never 100% sure what he's (56:29 - 56:35)
watching it's rarely Netflix it's almost (56:32 - 56:37)
never Hulu I think he may have a (56:35 - 56:40)
separate Netflix profile from like 20 (56:37 - 56:43)
years ago I don't I could not tell you I (56:40 - 56:45)
couldn't tell you what they look like (56:43 - 56:48)
the old will Anderson DVD program oh (56:45 - 56:52)
boy uh last bit of news here is (56:48 - 56:55)
celebrate the start of 2024 with a grand (56:52 - 56:58)
event that is niantic's words not mine (56:55 - 57:01)
um from Monday January 1st to Wednesday (56:58 - 57:04)
January 3rd this is a short event so uh (57:01 - 57:06)
buckle up here Jigglypuff wearing a (57:04 - 57:10)
ribbon and Wigglytuff wearing a ribbon (57:06 - 57:14)
half egg hatch distance when eggs into (57:10 - 57:19)
incubator um 1/4 half egg distance for (57:14 - 57:21)
the first three eggs during the event (57:19 - 57:24)
using the egg hatching widget I feel (57:21 - 57:25)
like they did this for like two months (57:24 - 57:27)
in a row and then stopped doing it and (57:25 - 57:28)
now they brought it (57:27 - 57:30)
back uh I think this works I I think (57:28 - 57:34)
both Android and Apple have the I (57:30 - 57:35)
catching (57:34 - 57:38)
widgets um so your first three eggs if (57:35 - 57:39)
you have the widget on your phone will (57:38 - 57:42)
have 1/4th instead of one half so just (57:39 - 57:46)

if you're really lucky trainers you (58:04 - 58:08)
might not actually see any bronzor (58:06 - 58:10)
because no one needs that Pokemon at all (58:08 - 58:11)

every baby Pokemon not wearing a hat um (58:42 - 58:49)
which I guess that's for whatever reason (58:47 - 58:51)
when they introduced Gen 2 they decided (58:49 - 58:54)
that baby Pokemon and New Year's were (58:51 - 58:56)
just I guess like the baby wearing the (58:54 - 58:58)

Trope it's baby New (58:58 - 59:04)

if you want to get a bunch of free stuff (59:43 - 59:48)
you should you should start now another (59:45 - 59:49)
social game (59:48 - 59:52)
unite you have to play with other people (59:49 - 59:54)
finally learned how much your anger out (59:52 - 59:56)
in (59:54 - 59:58)
I finally learned how much fun it is to (59:56 - 60:01)
actually play with other people yeah you (59:58 - 60:04)
know in unite for the first time since (60:01 - 60:07)
the game came (60:04 - 60:07)
out uh there's a lot of mascaradas I (60:09 - 60:16)
finally got my Fe free Mascara (60:12 - 60:16)
so I'm I'm set going in and Metagross is (60:16 - 60:21)
here Metagross comes you can get a top (60:19 - 60:24)
hat and a monacle for Metagross how much (60:21 - 60:25)
is that 15 (60:24 - 60:28)
tier (60:25 - 60:29)
costume (60:28 - 60:32)
eight I can't remember pring and unite (60:29 - 60:35)
it's it's either like like 25 or 40 I (60:32 - 60:37)
feel like are no I think this one's one (60:35 - 60:41)
of the cheaper ones uh like like $8 one (60:37 - 60:43)
yeah I think it's one of the8 (60:41 - 60:46)
ones I it's not it wasn't that bad (60:43 - 60:48)
because I don't think it it it only (60:46 - 60:50)
appears on the final form and not on the (60:48 - 60:53)
others so those are always (60:50 - 60:58)
cheaper uh good a (60:53 - 60:58)
monacle anyways uh I guess if you need (60:58 - 61:06)
help with BBQs you can join our (61:02 - 61:10)
Discord it will be the top pin comment (61:06 - 61:12)
whenever I remember to pin the top (61:10 - 61:14)
comment (61:12 - 61:19)
uh we have a very good threaded area so (61:14 - 61:21)
it it doesn't clog up in the Discord if (61:19 - 61:22)
you're in the slack there's a little (61:21 - 61:26)
Co-op section there (61:22 - 61:28)
um if you need if you need friends in (61:26 - 61:32)
Pokemon go again in our Discord I I (61:28 - 61:34)
promise you will get friends versus just (61:32 - 61:36)
jumping into random streams and just (61:34 - 61:37)
posting your friend code and be like why (61:36 - 61:39)
is no one adding me why would I add (61:37 - 61:42)
somebody who's just random say hi and (61:39 - 61:44)
hello you will be if you say hi and (61:42 - 61:48)
hello to most situations you will be 90% (61:44 - 61:50)
above everyone else you you you have you (61:48 - 61:52)
have gone above and beyond just by (61:50 - 61:59)
saying hello you have done it I promise (61:52 - 61:59)
you (61:59 - 62:04)
um yeah uh I learned how here's the (62:01 - 62:07)
actual end of 2023 I finally got around (62:04 - 62:09)
to doing ogre (62:07 - 62:11)
outing (62:09 - 62:14)
oh and apparently they they they fixed (62:11 - 62:16)
it they made it they said they they (62:14 - 62:17)
adjusted the difficulty they didn't say (62:16 - 62:20)
whether it's harder or easier the (62:17 - 62:21)
internet said they made it slightly (62:20 - 62:22)
easier I don't know how hard it was (62:21 - 62:25)
before the only reason I didn't do orous (62:22 - 62:27)
is because I I was doing other things in (62:25 - 62:28)
scarlet and violet so I was like I'll do (62:27 - 62:30)
my one mission for the tutorial I'll (62:28 - 62:31)
eventually come back to this it's not (62:30 - 62:35)
going anywhere I did or grousing um I (62:31 - 62:37)
got the shiny jumbo marked Munchlax and (62:35 - 62:39)
then I helped 10 other people get the (62:37 - 62:42)
shiny I want to help more people get the (62:39 - 62:45)
shiny so uh when I do come back to (62:42 - 62:47)
stream I will do some more ogre rousting (62:45 - 62:50)
I actually genuinely think it's fun and (62:47 - 62:53)
so uh I I really like the the the worst (62:50 - 62:55)
thing about ogre Ting is the worst thing (62:53 - 62:57)
about scarlet and violet which is the (62:55 - 62:59)
frame rate be like oh ogre ating would (62:57 - 63:01)
be better if the frame rate was better (62:59 - 63:03)
the whole game would be better if the (63:01 - 63:06)
frame rate was better the entire the (63:03 - 63:09)
entire experience (63:06 - 63:13)
rains flying (63:09 - 63:13)
traversing more people might be willing (63:13 - 63:17)
to admit that scarlet and violet are (63:16 - 63:19)
actually really good games if the frame (63:17 - 63:22)
rate was better yeah yeah I I think for (63:19 - 63:23)
I think for a lot of people Scarlet (63:22 - 63:24)
Violet would probably be a top three (63:23 - 63:29)
game if if it ran decently um because it (63:24 - 63:31)
affects everything it affects raids it (63:29 - 63:34)
affects ousting it affects the (63:31 - 63:37)
DLC um some people are okay with that (63:34 - 63:39)
like but for other people like the frame (63:37 - 63:41)
rate does matter (63:39 - 63:46)
um anyways uh again I I plan to help (63:41 - 63:48)
people do ogre ousting I like I (63:46 - 63:50)
genuinely like helping people that's why (63:48 - 63:52)
I do a news podcasts it's why I make (63:50 - 63:54)
YouTube videos it's why I stream on (63:52 - 63:56)
Twitch I genuinely like helping people (63:54 - 64:00)
so um anyways hey here's your here's (63:56 - 64:04)
your start to 2024 start saying hi hello (64:00 - 64:06)
