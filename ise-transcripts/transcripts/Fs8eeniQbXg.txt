[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 448th episode of the pokemon podcast i don't know why 450 seems big but it i mean it's a it's a 50 yeah things that end in zero especially five zeroes are important five zeros oh five zero five zero like as old as greg is right now yes it's uh super effective i'm your host sbj greg here the fiveist of zeros i am the fivest of zeros i guess if in a scale of one to ten i'm a fifty that what we're saying yeah yeah yeah yeah it's a compliment it better be it's going into the lawsuits not i mean i just found out what six means in red and six which probably both of you have no idea what that is but what i was so disappointed what what in six it's a character from magic ren and six we'll also hear i number one will take all of your uh your i guess you're supposed to get me presents because in the um lunar zodiac it is now year of the ox and i am an ox for the rest of the year you have to give me gifts because my cycle has returned i decided to party hardcore for our nice lunar new year celebration and given that i do not tolerate the key ingredient i have been suffering for the past two days so so but i was like i am going to have roast pork buns for lunar new year i don't care the consequences that was me on friday night and there's an asian market like three miles from my house and yeah saturday and sunday i've been like hmm i mean happy new year the things we do for love sure we have a uh a lot to cover this week this upcoming weekend this podcast comes out on monday this upcoming weekend is the kanto i don't what is the name of this thing canto fest canto happy happy hat pokemon go tour kanto really hitting it out of the park with these names haven't we been counting down to this for like five weeks now it's been it's been like four months forever it's been i've been counting down since i don't know 1990 i couldn't find the exact date of when they initially announced this but it was the end of december beginning of january isn't it in their giant list of updates have you looked at that giant list of updates i mean december 1 celebrate the arrival pokemon it was discovered in kayla's with a special event like i can find a lot of things in here are we just looking for the first time they said hey we're doing a kanto thing yeah i couldn't figure out the first time they said i figured out the first time they said like the countdown which was unova week because they started with unova and then cinno and we know the rest so that's coming this weekend uh we're going to talk about that later in the show and then the following weekend which is february where's my calendar february 27th which is a saturday uh is pokemon day though i would expect some announcements friday evening if those announcements are uh japanese related so for example if we want to look at any kind of patterns normally a pokemon movie for japan is announced that day but not announced for us because they normally get their movies in june we get our movies in whenever whenever later in the year but because of covet i'm sure that might throw things off so who knows if they're gonna announce a movie we still don't even know when this rude movie is coming for us although i do expect the old netflix release date next week so next week uh next week's pot this is weird because we're gonna be recording before the kanto tour we're gonna be recording thursday so i can get it edited because i'll be on the road friday and sunday and then playing all day on saturday with greg and will very excited uh so we won't have our thoughts for the canto tour on the the episode that comes out on the 22nd next week uh we'll save our thoughts for the i don't think there's going to be like a lot of thoughts there will probably be some ups and some downs and you know 20-minute conversation and we'll move on but you don't know what stories we're gonna generate when the three of us are together in one location look i am going to find that door of the explorer pokestop and i'm going to stock up on it's closed dude i can reach it i don't have to be next to it to to spin the stop i need to stock up on those gifts so i can send people dora the explorer and swiper and maybe spongebob i still have spongebob right yeah yeah got stock up on all the nickelodeon okay and the lego dragon which is awesome lego dragon is also good okay so here's the plan we're going to talk about some tcg stuff we're going to talk about the pokemon go stuff and we have a bunch of other stuff to talk about that's going to be the episode a lot to work through here let's start off with the an article from polygon [Music] titled the pokemon happy meals are at mcdonald's are getting ruined by greedy adults like you edmund ruined admit it it's you you are the culprit you're because i the villain photos i did buy pokemon cards yeah this is this is like a tough full disclosure here i did buy some happy meals some i went did you buy happy meals or did you buy the packs of cards without the meal okay what do you what do you want you want my story first or you want this article we should probably read the article first select mcdonald's are celebrating the 25th anniversary of pokemon with a promotion that turns the iconic happy meal box into a pikachu face bundled with the pikachu face container there are 50 collectible cards 25 are hollow 25 or not it doesn't say this in the article i'm i'm filling in the blanks here for the author uh pokemon cards are a hot commodity that's true that fans are having a hard time finding booster packs at big retailers also true nearly every week there's a new broken record for the dollars that people are spending for old school packs also true mcdonald's promotion in other words never stood a chance we said this on this podcast yes folks are waking up early to stake out mcdonald's uh that are selling happy meals some are apparently buying happy meals in mass numbers in hopes of getting the collectibles and throwing out the food i'm sure that's happening i haven't seen that happen but i'm sure that is happening i guarantee it's happening some mcdonald's are even placing restrictions on buying happy meals scalpers are reportedly already turning around and selling individual cards at a markup oh gosh there's a lot to talk about here if you don't like pokemon tcg cards it's just the interesting dynamic of like what is actually happening here um some customers are going around to multiple restaurants that was me uh unable to find a happy meal also me uh on websites like ebay entire boxes of cards are being uh sealed and going for hundreds of dollars i literally spent three hours on my twitch stream looking at ebay prices for this stuff the day this happened it was very interesting we reached out to a comment to mcdonald's and mcdonald's told polygon the following quote with significant demand for our promotional pokemon tcg and some fans even going to extreme lakes to get them we are working quickly to address the shortage and also strongly encouraging restaurants to set a reasonable limit on happy meals sold per customer we want to offer the full happy meal experience to as many families as possible to ensure everyone is able to get in on the fun i do like the the wording they have here where do we start well i will say one i since i didn't jump in when we were talking about wasting food uh the one person i saw on my facebook who did get uh 15 happy meals at one location got all nugget meals because then they could redo like the nuggets in their air fryer rather than throwing them away so it wasn't wasteful oh but what about the fries you eat those fries as fast as possible i was just saying are you sitting on fries no no no no no right down the gullet bags from uh good size they're small yeah they're kid size uh so i i went to ten different mcdonald's the day it came out i went with my friend tim he drove because look my friend tim has a tesla he looks for any reason in the world to drive around [Laughter] knowing tim this is no surprise whatsoever i will buy that 100 yes i called them up i said hey i want to go to mcdonald's i want to film it for youtube and i just think it would be fun to see like because we we know that every mcdonald's is different every mcdonald's has their own rules their own restrictions see if we can get my goal was to get like 15 packs of cards and i figured if i got 15 packs i'd at least complete the 25 collection i wouldn't get all the hollows but i'd at least be close and then the last like couple hollows i'm missing i'll just buy them off tcgplayer for however much they're going for and i don't think 15 packs of cards is unreasonable i don't want to spoil the video that'll come out this coming friday which is the 19th but every mcdonald's had different rules like the first mcdonald's we went to they were like we can't sell you the packs we know that like okay so let me back up every mcdonald's knew about pokemon they they like knew before we got like they they were warned they were well ahead of time i'm sure plenty of people already arrived before us trying to look for these cards anyways the first mcdonald's said this they said you can buy as many happy meals as you want and we will sell you two extra packs of cards but there was no limit on happy meals and so i was like okay that mcdonald's is really close to where this is i didn't want any food to go to waste and i did want like my thought process at this very first mcdonald's is like i don't know if other mcdonald's are gonna have these i'll take five happy meals i'm gonna eat one tim's gonna eat one or and then there's two homeless people over well spoiler tim didn't eat any there's two homeless people over like two blocks away that are always on this corner and we're gonna drop the happy meals off over there and then that way i got seven packs from that very first mcdonald's i bought five they sold me two extra the second mcdonald's was like we're only we're only selling with happy meals and i was like okay no thanks i don't need i don't i already got rid of the food don't need any more food don't eat it i i cannot possibly eat any more fries right now the third mcdonald's was the same like you had to buy happy meals okay next mcdonald's was you can buy one pack of cards if you want more you gotta buy the happy meal but we'll sell you one pack of carts cool i'll take the one pack of cards third mcdonald's was like we don't even have any cards anymore or fourth mcdonald's like we don't have anything i have cards so every what the point i'm saying is every mcdonald's was different which i show in the video i fundamental maybe because i am an adult buying cards i agree with like mcdonald's is getting ruined by greedy well okay i do i unless they're specifically talking about scalpers yes but i there's like this thing going around on social media where like other people think they're better than other people for not buying happy meals like this is not look i've i've been buying i've i've purchased my gold in my closet sitting next to my ancient mew my gold burger king pokemon cards when i was a kid i have purchased my like every other happy meal i've been doing this for 25 years there's not all of a sudden like i i hit a certain age where i'm not allowed to participate in cars it's not yeah it's not restricted to pokemon but but here's the real thing right you're looking at it from the perspective of they're shaming me because i'm too old to be buying happy meals right this this the real ruse here and it's the real twisting of the facts is they're putting into the the general imagination that there are thousands of crying children in the world because those children couldn't get the pokemon uh happy meal that they so desperately needed the minute they woke up well number one you told your kid that there was a pokemon happy meal if that's truly the case where you could have not commercialized your child and number two oh come on kids aren't that like infatuated yes kids love pokemon but they're not like oh if i don't get that pokemon happy meal my life is going to be ruined for the next you know 50 years kids are like that i mean kids will say that like we we as adults know that's not true but in the moment with that screeching toddler who isn't getting what they want that that is a real situation like they had that expectation they aren't getting it we know they will forget in a week but you are still dealing with that child and i think it's not so much if it wasn't for the i'm buying a giant pack and putting it up on ebay if it wasn't for the scalping if it wasn't for people going and saying i've just purchased all of this mcdonald's happy meal stock and are out because i decided to buy them all i think that's where we start treading on the okay what are you going for and why are you buying some money because if it's for collection you like you know as well as everybody else that they will go up for sale later is the idea that you want to cash in quick right now by making it a scarce commodity and then flipping it around i think that that is that is sort of the part where adults with a lot of money are creating a market that we know isn't real yeah right and uh and that's a problem i get it i get it from both sides right i am not going to shame somebody who's been collecting pokemon cards for 20 plus years to be like oh you you can't possibly buy a happy meal what's wrong with you it's the same food it's a it's a it's it's all that it's a cheese river and fries it's no different than ordering a cheeseburger and fries the only difference is you're paying a premium for them to put a toy in it and that toy is pokemon cards they're not unique to the things that are on target they're literally reprinted at the same cards so like one this is what they've stated this is what they state for literally every happy meal not every mcdonald's gets the same amount depends on how much you sell where your mcdonald's is located but i do understand if you live in like i i don't know i wasn't gonna say sheboygan wisconsin sheboygan's kind of big uh if you live in like oconomowoc wisconsin and they got one mcdonald's and some scalper goes and they buy out all the happy meals yes that does suck for that specific town because i only have one mcdonald's i get it that is not restricted to pokemon stuff that is whatever is in demand like mcdonald's has had beanie babies same thing happened and the same complaints happened then so yep same complaints happened then i live in milwaukee wisconsin we have probably 40 mcdonald's yeah at one point i had a map going to all 40 it would have taken six hours to drive well how wait wouldn't you have to recharge the tesla yeah yeah see we could we could only go to 10 on the tesla battery get wreck tesla okay the the other problem that the other thing that i saw which again is just not maybe understanding the situation is like people yelling at mcdonald's of like why why would you release these cards now when they were about they were bound to fail there is no way that a billion dollar company like pokemon and another billion dollar company like mcdonald's decided this program this promotion two weeks ago oh absolutely the cards had to be designed pikachu on the card is unique i would i would safely assume that this promotion was was probably designed before vivid voltage came out which was like vivid watches was like four or five four months ago i think and when vivid voltage came out you could still buy vivid voltage for like the two weeks the first two weeks vivid voltage debuted you could walk into a target you could buy packs you could go on cool stuff inc or troll and toad and you could get a booster box for 99 and it was wasn't only it was about two to three weeks after after vivid voltage came out which is when the logan paul twenty thousand dollar charizard box and then the the supply and demand and people ran out and all pokemon cards are sold out if you're one of the the few people posting on social media very upset that this is like mcdonald's fault no it's just timing like it wasn't even vivid voltage's fault because again when vivid voltage came out you could just get it it was very easy to get now it's very hard to get they didn't print enough vivid voltage they definitely printed enough of xy evolutions because xy evolutions finally sold out after five years of existing uh they finally sold out because of this tcg craze if for whatever reason the pandemic didn't happen and people weren't sitting at home with extra money because this is something i've explained in my twitch stream this like the tcg fad will crash once the pandemic is over because what happens is people will move their money elsewhere if i have extra money because i'm not going to baseball games i'm not going to concerts i'm not traveling the world i'm not taking a trip to puerto rico i'm not going to fancy restaurants to dine in because a lot of them are closed or a lot of them are only limited to man so it makes it really hard to book i'm not going to spas i'm not going rock climbing i'm not going to the gym people have extra money because they can't do anything else with their money so they buy dumb pokemon cards because that's the one thing they can do right now but like again once the pandemic is over am i going to continue spending 200 on pokemon cards or am i going to spend the 200 and take a trip down to uh disneyland that's not disneyland it's not 200 that was a bad example 200 of disney world but the point still stands take 200 to go to the dells there you go that's a nice day this is also not the first time we've ever had pokemon cards at button mcdonald's this is like the 100th time we've had pokemon cards at mcdonald's very true and i will say name a single mcdonald's pokemon card somebody's gonna be like well this japanese mcdonald's no okay yes sure one japanese mcdonald's pokemon card probably worth like 80 bucks but name one english pokemon card at mcdonald's that is worth money today none of them are maybe like six bucks for like some like squirtle or pikachu or whatever none of them are worth money let me bring up the ancient mew card that everyone thought was gonna be worth money it's also worth about six bucks hey how about the uh entei promotion for the third ante movie not worth anything the zapdos small trace articuno for pokemon the movie 2000 the power of us where the bad guy's name is sir lawrence the third no one ever remembers that but those cards i remember that every time they're worth nothing some cards some there there are there are exceptions there are some weird pokemon cards like the delivery pikachu right now from the pokemon center promotion it's like worth 200 bucks there are some cards that break some weird barrier and they're worth something but it does suck although it's not unexpected that scalpers went to mcdonald's they bought 150 packs they bought 100 packs they bought 500 packs and then they immediately put them on ebay i am not going to grill somebody who is 25 years old who has been collecting pokemon cards for 10 years that wants to buy like 10 packs from mcdonald's you're fine don't feel bad about it it's they're just cards and guess what if if mcdonald's ran out of happy meal cards they got other happy meals to do like they will never not have happy meals they have old happy meals but that that that i can't imagine that situation is so unique to right now because again not every mcdonald's gets the same supply of toys not every mcdonald's gets the same supply uh not every mcdonald's has the same restrictions there is probably like a mcdonald's that was told hey limit these but they didn't care somebody probably pulled up in the chevy blazer and bought their entire stock and the the franchise owner of that mcdonald's just simply didn't care is that is that the person yes but that's also the dude i mean like that's also the like mcdonald's fault for selling all 100 person at the window that i wouldn't blame it on the owner right it's the person at the window who was like oh i didn't realize we weren't supposed to sell all of them all at once but i did want to say two things um for people who might be confused as to like why doesn't mcdonald's just make a roll that says one per customer or something like uh mcdonald's is a real estate company they're not a restaurant company they um sell real estate to franchisees who then are allowed to operate a mcdonald's restaurant on that real estate so they they in general don't make rules about how each individual restaurant runs that's up to the franchisee to determine for their own market the other thing is and greg this is kind of a realization that i've had this i i think the big thing is that this is a a pure like conflagration of of the zoomer world you've got the boomers out there who think that they're going to find like baseball cards in the old days where there's like oh i'm going to find this one super rare baseball card that's going to make me rich like that mentality that they've seeded into the world and then you've got all the millennials out there who are like well i just got to find the next scam to make enough money because i'm not getting paid enough anyways so like all scams are now perfectly legal and it's like we're gen x we're caught in the middle and we're like whatever whatever y'all do what you got to do yeah whatever kids have fun what was the point again none of these cards are actually worth money this is the this is the actual shocking thing so on tuesday when the cards came out the most i saw a pikachu card sell for was eighty dollars all the other cards the chimchar holo pikachu sorry the chimchar the piplup the squirtle the charmander the froakie the most i ever saw any of those sell for were like four dollars i think maybe the charmander was six uh the froakie was like 250 and these are sold auctions and somebody came into my twitch stream and somebody said oh uh somebody on ebay you just can't listen to twitch somebody well i disproved it really easily somebody came in and they were like oh somebody on ebay bought all the hollows the complete collection for nine thousand dollars no they didn't yeah they did look look look the see the auction ended at nine thousand dollars sure the auction ended at nine thousand dollars but why would anyone pay that amount the most a single pikachu went for was eighty dollars if you were if you were even if you were to do eighty dollars by 25 just assume that every single one of these cards was eighty dollars your math is two thousand dollars so why would anyone pay seven thousand extra dollars to get it and they were like but that's what it ended at and i was like okay let me explain ebay to you i'm very familiar with it just like there are some scalpers on ebay there are people on ebay that only bid on things to waste scalpers time so for example if there is a hot commodity on ebay here's a really good example this is actually the only example in this episode that i will probably get right that wasn't a disney reference or a bad car reference is when amoeba and when uh when nintendo amiibos came out they also had the same problem we're talking right now and because people were so frustrated about amiibos being bought out at target every single morning because the scalpers would wait outside target at like 6 a.m buy all the amiibos and then put them on ebay is there was a group of people and this has existed on ebay for a long time and they will bid on the scalpers items and they will drive the prices up and they will win the auction and then they won't pay and their only penalty from ebay is their account gets like banned for like 30 days you know what you do you just make another free ebay account and you do it again and you do that to the same oh it's very easy to find scalpers because they use the same ebay username and you can find all their auctions very easily and then you just bid on all of them and then when it ends in 24 hours or five days or whatever time they set it which is usually like five days right in ebay auctions like five to seven days you win the bid they wasted a week to hope that they get money at the end they don't get the money they then have to argue with ebay about how you didn't pay but you don't care because you're just gonna make another ebay account and then they get ebay goes okay well they didn't pay you get to relist and now they have to wait a whole nother week to sell these items again and you know what happens those people do the same thing and now it's two weeks and a lot can change in two weeks especially for a scalper because they need to sell when those products are hot let me give you another really good example that pikachu card that was 80 on tuesday it was 40 on wednesday because these cars are not worth anything they only worth 80 dollars is because like people are desperate for the pikachu card but the price keeps going down because no one actually cares about like no like that it doesn't matter they're just cards in in six weeks or six months or whenever this event is over like look it up look at look up the black and white unova ones they had a bunch of the same sparkly cards none of them are worth more than five bucks and there's only there's like 10 of them it really says something though because this used to be an issue in vanguard as well because they always used to do the pre-releases one week before the actual set came out and in that week which i used to call golden hype week it was like cards were 10 times on tcg player what after the actual set came out they would actually be but it's just because people like had to have the card before anybody else yes you literally can't wait one week yep yeah yep it's it was just like the um the shiny charizard from champions path when it first came out ungraded charizard from champion champions path was twelve hundred dollars and that was like the week before champions path came out and then champion's path came out and within the like first two weeks of champions path coming out that shiny charizard ungraded was 800 and now i looked it up before the episode because we we spent like i said i spent three hours on ebay the other day looking at these cards now that same charizard from champions path shiny charizard is 360 ungraded now you could you could grade it to get more but people want the newest shiniest thing on day one and then over time people have a less desire to get it and or the scalpers are just not the scalpers in that case you could you could easily just pull that charizard on day one and be like oh well if it's selling for a thousand i don't care that much i'd rather have the thousand dollars i don't blame you if you're one of the first people that pulled the shiny charizard on champions path i would probably just get rid of it and then buy it back like six months later when it's drastically cheaper but again this whole situation is not exclusive to pokemon cards like the digimon card game just launched in america officially again because it launched back in the 90s it's a different one different one different game but it just launched this week and it's completely sold out it's impossible to get the only thing i feel like that isn't sold out nowadays is magic but i'm sure i'm sure people are desperate for cards maybe they'll move to magic next please please no i think it's really wild magic is magic makes very little sense but magic cards in like if you want to get into the craziness of magic you can buy thousand dollar cards if you want i think the moral of this story is scalpers are the worst no matter what they're scalping true true they are trying to manipulate things to make a quick buck for things that aren't aren't worth that quick buck if you really want this pikachu card just wait like right now i'm seeing this one going for forty two dollars with four dollar shipping ends in like two hours i it might go up a little bit but well okay so i will say this to anyone who's under the age of 25 right now there was a point in my life where there were transformers that i really really wanted and i was like it breaks my heart that i can't have this transform i didn't have the money whatever guess what i'm 47 years old i don't even remember which transformer it was the feeling will pass time erases everything exactly yes gratefully thank goodness so out of all of this tcg stuff the pokemon company put out an update on the support.pokemon.com they say we are aware that you are experienced some difficulties purchasing certain pokemon trading card game products due to very high demand and global shipping constraints impacting availability we understand that this inconvenience can be disappointing for fans we are working to address it with where it is within our control in situations where limited availability we are actively working to print more of the impacted tcg products as quickly as possible and at maximum capacity to support the increased demand reprinted products will be available at retailers as soon as possible for the new pokemon tcg expansion expansions launching the future we are maximizing production to increase product availability upon release we will continue to reprint products to replenish stock at retailers as soon as possible we'd like to thank the community for their continued support and patience as we work to deliver more tcg products to fans and this is this is a very common thing right like when like unbroken bonds and unified mines came out those did eventually sell out after like six months of being released and they were kind of hard to find although if you walk into before this before all these cards sold out which was around christmas time uh you could still find like crimson invasion you could still find fates collide you could still find uh xy evolutions because they made too many of those sets because they thought they were gonna sell well and they didn't but then they made too few like unified mines which did actually sell well so now i i expect what the problem is going to be there's going to be a point in like the next 10 months where the only thing on shelves is going to be like vivid voltage and darkness ablaze because they're going to like reprint them all right no vivid voltage is a good set right now i don't know if it's gonna be a good set in 10 months they're gonna probably reprint like a bunch of darkness ablaze and vivid voltage and probably battle styles battle styles is probably gonna be the new crimson invasion uh which is to say like yeah i think battle sales is gonna sell real well yeah uh but like crimson invasion was like the worst set ever it was a bad set when it came out like there was there was no reason to get it unless like you wanted like the main card from that set was like a buzzwell and like b standard b b string and neither like b string i think was uncommon and buzzwell was like rare but it was like a four dollar rare but i don't particularly think there's like and the problem with like not the problem but the the the timing of darkness ablaze which had a charizard in it and champion's path which had two charizards in it and vivid voltage which had fat pikachu in it those are all my grandma knows those pokemon like everyone knows those pokemon the chase card the sought after card in in battle styles is hershey foo and nursing food very new so i don't know if that's going to be there's no charizard in that set there's no pikachu in that set like i don't know if not having gen one nostalgia i get it there's somebody i hate that gen 1 nostalgia yeah okay but guess what it sells case in point yeah it certainly does but i don't think battle styles has anything like very shiny that is just as recognizable as a fat pikachu on a card like it's say what you will about pikachu it's a very recognizable pokemon uh and i love irshifu i think hershey food's cool he's a cool dude wait a minute which one uh both hershey foods are in the set no no no which one do you think is a cool dude because they can't both be oh the water oh the water yeah water fighting water has never been cool dude water fighting is just poli-wrap you're not wrong that's the tcg talk there's a lot let's take a break uh and then let's argue some more about the kanto fest celebration okay [Music] i just woke up it's 3 p.m [Music] it's okay it's cool [Music] we are back uh before we get to the pokemon go stuff there is a shiny toxicity being given out using pokemon pass at gamestop that's it that's a thing again i think this is probably planned six months ago hoping the pandemic maybe would be over yeah is there something why i just don't understand why it's pokemon i do understand why it's pokemon pass because they have to scan the qr code and you have to be within the vicinity of the location it uses your gps right you can't scan the qr code at home you have to go to the game stop or go at least outside the game stop so you can do it from your car so this is your this is your coved solution and give you the hot tip here you go with a friend or your significant other or your family what a perfect valentine's date well no because you can't do this until the 19th oh all right take that back you have them you have your significant other friend etc pull up the qr code on their phone while you're in the parking lot of gamestop in your car safe and sound you use your phone you scan their phone for the qr code and then you switch you pull up the qr code so you can't you can't do this without another person there might be actually you know there was a point i want to say it was the target one because i couldn't find the qr code and i think if you like there was a button in the app yeah there was a there was there's always been like if you can't find the code somewhere in the store because they probably didn't put it up uh hit this button yeah i i thought the target ones you had to be like on the target wi-fi or something i think so i just remember i went to a target in dc and i bet they did not have it they didn't have it at all that sounds about right but i don't i i i have for all of these codes i do not ever remember scanning a qr code like the whole qr code people things are talking about i'm like what what i have scanned some qr codes i don't remember doing this now me either you don't remember collecting the stickers for the detected pikachu movie by scanning qr codes scattered around target wasn't that fun no no i didn't oh i i remember finding the stickers i do remember doing that once at the target downtown pokemon home this is this is the thought process pokemon home if you click the hamburger menu you click mystery gifts you you click local event check your gps is being initialized does this feature just not work have they not figured out how to make it work yet not yet it's been a whole year they're clearing out all the pokemon pass agreements before they switch over yeah it was you know that that could be true they could have done like a five we're we're doing five distributions with gamestop we haven't hit our quota yet i i guess now we do the toxicity quota i'm curious and we'll have to put this on the list of things to test uh next weekend is the game stop in the mall of america is not your traditional gamestop strip mall gamestop it is gamestop pop culture yay i'm curious whether they will have this distribution i'm sure they will i don't know speaking of pokemon home there was a pokemon home update happy one year of pokemon home greg and will happy one year they got my money i sat there and think and i was like the week leading up because i got the warning hey we're gonna charge you money and i'm like am i going to pay another 16 for nothing and the answer was yes because i decided i guess i'm paying 16 for nothing because i really didn't want to try to go through the pain of figuring out where i wanted to put things how many pokemon do you have at home i don't know like 2 000. okay that is a lot only 2 000 yeah i have i've been really really really lazy about moving my bank stuff up and i've been using it as a oh hey you're out of space in pokemon go and then i'll just fire it up and send a bunch of things i never think to do that because i didn't have uh pokemon home installed on my new phone ah they did put out a update that i think for the most part people were excited about came out of nowhere excited uh you know like like was twitter a buzz about a pokemon home update apart from yours [Music] it's possible this is uh it's a it's a 263 megabyte update it's version 1.3.2 i will state in the eight years pokemon bank existed it was an eight years old it only had four updates pokemon home has had over uh 10 now 10 updates in the one year it's been out so that's good i guess yes almost that's what almost two dollars an update yeah okay so what they said here in the update is you can receive all pokemon uh a feature that has been added to wonderbox that's nice people were excited about that one the date a pokemon was first i'm still calling foul on you're excited the date a pokemon was first met is now displayed in trainer notes that's good hey nice hey that's good from the ot which is short for original trainer field in a pokemon's detailed information you can now search for pokemon with the same original trainer that seems like a good one you can now specify language and you can search by pokeball when searching for a pokemon that one very good i can now search for all my love ball pokemon for example i mean i put everything in luxury balls it's luxury balls or cherish balls like i don't have any choice over the cherished balls you can now arrange your list of pokemon in the same order used by your pokemon boxes in the nintendo switch version of pokemon home greg they listened to you it it only took a year it took a full year thanks pokemon home for doing the thing you should have done they really wanted your 16 again they did this is ultimately my decision to knowing that they'll listen to me once a year i said yeah i'll give you 16 bucks yeah it's it's only common courtesy it is you know what they didn't update the switch version you know what i still can't see on the switch version my ribbons and my marks i don't understand i just don't it's it's been a year of pokemon home i've used it coming it's coming i've used i'm sure maybe it is maybe in like two more years it is so hard to recommend the 16 product when it's so bad and it's not even like bad bad it's just inconveniently bad yes yeah the best kind of bad yeah it works it does what it's advertised to do no one is debating that it accepts your pokemon it organizes your pokemon you can put them into specific boxes you can search for them you can mass transfer it like like does what it's advertised to do but how is there one person like all it takes is one person who works at game freak who was like why when we switched to pokemon home are all the buttons flipped around why is the like eleanor you're the only one who cares about the buttons because you don't pay attention to what's going on on the screen no it's so jarring it is i have never been jarred not once i know you are but here's the thing since they listened to me this year next year to get the 16 bucks they will listen to you and make that one change so i have to single delete my so i do a lot of mark hunting i think this is very well known i like to catch every pokemon i see i like to see if it has a mark and if it doesn't have a mark i throw it away if it does have a mark i put it in a box where it lives for about two months and then two months later i go ah dang it i got two of these too many of these marks now i gotta throw some away because i got dupl i got a lot of sleepy marks over here uh this is the life i live it's terrible how do you afford all these pokeballs uh black market yep the actual travesty is the amount of people who are watching my stream going steve why don't you move them to pokemon home so you can mass transfer them i can't do that do you know why because i can't see marks in pokemon home i can't see ribbons i can't see anything it's like this feature that has existed since i don't know gen 3 and it doesn't work in the switch version of the app i don't understand the sad thing is because you're the only person that actually cares about this stuff but transfer it to pokemon home then pull up your phone pull it up on your phone because you're already playing the other game on your switch so you don't have to leave sword and shield you just have it on your phone easy situation solved i'm i'm a problem solver you just need to go i agree i am glad that pokemon home got an update it is uh hopefully there are more updates i would assume i would hope i guess we're getting the p oh gosh we gotta talk about the pikachu man this news is going right into this news announced a pikachu with the exclusive move sing so this is off uh 25. it is a uh it's a you need a password through mystery gift pikachu will know the move sing it'll be in a cherish ball ot will be game freak uh it will have the souvenir ribbon it will know sing encore celebrate electro ball on the website it says come back on february 25th for a password you can use to add this pokemon to your team i was going to say is this another email thing so some places say it's coming in email and on the website so it might be both i'm hoping they're doing both because the fiasco was the last password so i'm hoping it is one universal just putting on here and being done with it because that's the way it should have happened for everything because there are still millions of starving children who never got the zeroed code yeah you guys all complaining about mcdonald's cards what happened to those poor kids that signed up with their parents email to get us over i'm probably the last person to get as a rude and thanks to tomahawk is the only name that i have for them yes or extra is a rude code but i would i would assume that we would get a pokemon like don't they want to reward the people paying 16 a month with a pokemon i guess you don't have to pay 16. you just have to have the app free yeah is sing pikachu the new meta i hope so i think so you gigantomax it yeah you sing 55 accuracy we'll never see it coming but what does it turn into does it just turn into shield yeah sing would be max guard what does what does sing do does it cause damage no it puts them no question to sleep [Music] with not a good rate yeah it's 50 yeah the spore is a hundred sleep powder i think is 60 75 75 70 i think so and then sing is sing is the worst of the sleeping moves it is the only thing that sing is no because i was going to say sing is good on milotic but i think mild to learn hypnosis but like milotic also learns coil and coil increases your like defense and your accuracy i think so that's why like yeah milotic runs hypnosis because the accuracy boost of coil yeah sleep powder is 75 i knew that because i use it on rosalia all the time sing is 55 it's bad it's bad this news is off go nintendo original stitch reveals more pokemon shirts uh they have revealed a grooky score bunny and sobble shirt if you're itching for some clothing uh the scoreboarding waiting for my helen just waiting for my hoe and stuff did you notice that they skipped over hohen and i

assuming they're gonna like officially announce slash mass roll out the gen 3 shirts on pokemon day oh i'd imagine yeah okay let's talk about the pokemon go tour kanto celebration i hate this name it'll take place on saturday february 21st from 9 a.m to 9 00 p.m okay so i think the the details here is the mew which is what the what people cared about since they announced this which we looked up the original announcement date i believe it was december 8th is what i have what greg found that sounds about right yeah yeah so at the time they were like hey there's going to be a canto tour it'll be 12 shiny mew you get to pick between red and green more details will come later i don't even think you could buy the ticket right away i think you buy the ticket like two months later yeah not two months sorry two weeks yeah february 8th is when they announced pretty much all the details yes february 9th sorry so about a week ago they announced what is called the master work research which is the mu stuff so prior to this i'm bringing up my twitch stream a lot but it's a real good feel of how many people were confused about this i think at least for me leading up to this event there was a lot of people that would be that would say like something along the lines of i don't know if i want to spend 12.99 and not get the shiny mew right totally understandable that's a that is a real concern yes and when i talked to niantic they said the following we can't talk about the details of the event just yet but just to let you know if you spend the 12.99 you will get the mew eventually like you can't not see like you could spend the 12 90. you could you could pull a will buy the pokemon go fest ticket and then just never log in to accept the quest and not get the victory i was busy that day i had things going on you were at a wedding i was in the wedding yes it was a busy day but i assured people if you if you spent the 12.99 you would definitely get the mew don't know how hard it would be but from niantic's wording the mew quest was supposed to be something that you wouldn't be able to complete the day of anyways it was going to be a long i'm almost positive and i don't have the article in front of me but it was supposed to be a long and difficult thing to complete it is a shiny view after all so on february 9th they announced the details of the masterwork quest they also announced how they were going to handle ditto which was a huge asterisk because people were like how am i supposed to find shiny ditto shiny ditto is the final reward for the saturday event ah so as once you complete the kanto fest shiny ditto will be the thing you end with so you're getting a shiny ditto guaranteed for 12.99 and you're getting a shiny mew guaranteed for 12.99 the only difference is you got to work for the mew the event schedule is it's ten hours it starts at nine o'clock in the morning ends at nine o'clock uh we'll just go through the schedule here we'll get to how to get the mew in a second from nine to ten as pallet town from 10 to 11 is pubert city from 11 to 12 is cerulean from 12 to 1 is fuchsia and then from one to two on my favor the only four cities in kanto and then from yeah just four one to two wreck lavender town is the pokemon league and then it repeats so two to three palette three to four can you just say pewter once please no never four to five cerulean five to six that's the worst color five to six to five to six in the future silver six of seven pokemon league and then at the very end 7 p.m to 9 p.m local time all pokemon that's when you go cram it all in from seven to nine no there's no cramer in this event thank heavens so if you have a non-ticket experience you will get some of the pokemon discovered in the kanto region in wild and raids you will still be able to participate in art articuno zapdos moltres and mewtwo which will be returning to raids all trainers will have event access to time limited research and the trade range will be increased to 40 kilometers and then again this is for both ticketed and non-ticketed articuno will know hurricane zapdos will know thundershock multitrace will know sky attack mewtwo will know sidestrike sorry no shadowball [Music] uh and then if you bought the tickets early you got special research stories for january and february which at the time were not announced but they ended up being result what was the roselli was from february what the heck was january yeah um my chop oh man chump manchester no that's our intellectual property don't confuse that with the pokemon's intellectual property greg and i certainly got a lot of shiny roselias we did some of us got more shiny roselias than other people whatever will i have secret back channels that are going to start feeding me shiny rosalia's left and right i have made deals across the globe to funnel your poor unwanted children to my caring arm the the benefit of the true benefit of the day was i actually saw two other human beings in person yeah which i haven't done in such a long time that was the highlight of the day truly because it was cold okay so the the masterwork research can be completed whenever you unlock it somewhere during the the saturday it contains tasks that uh for getting the canto platinum medal you have to catch 30 pokemon of every single type how many types are there 18 yeah something like that so 18 times 30 how many pokemon is that too many too many uh that's like 500 pokemon uh wait 18. 540. yeah you have to spin 151 unique pokestops all right i have to talk about that you have to what walk 151 kilometers which i believe is 91 miles i think and then you have to reach level 40. this is the big one that some people are upset about okay so before so the 151 look again we talk about this all the time pokemon go is not a fair game if you live in oconomowoc wisconsin you you might have like 10 pokestops that's not 151. it is cold it is negative one in wisconsin right now very hard to go outside unlike if you lived in california or florida right now it's probably 70 it's probably beautiful out you could probably safely social distance at a park and have a great time uh well maybe not california because california uh but it is it is not fair in the sense of pokemon go is better in big cities if i lived in boston and i was downtown in boston i probably hit 151 stops in in a whole day because literally every single brick in that city is a pokestop they're like this brick has three words written on it we can't read it because it's a hundred years old but it is now a pokestop that is boston in a nutshell i think there are probably 151 pokestops in milwaukee pretty easily but it would require me to drive a lot and it's cold i'll do it i'll do it in like three months oh you'll get it done before three months are up so the level 40. level 40 is not easy to get to this game has been out for over five years there are a lot of people that are not level 40. uh but in order to get the shiny mu you need the 151 stops catch 30 of each type which again that's going to be also hard if there's not a dragon type event happening unless i don't know you live in some dragon biome and you're seeing dratini's nonstop i don't i see like one dragon a week you have to walk 151 kilometers i don't know will you walk a lot what is how about how much you walk in a day i mean for me that's about two weeks i i usually get about 70 kilometers uh for like the what is it adventure sink i usually get about 70 to 75 kilometers a week so two weeks for you for that yeah i've only walked around my house so it'll be four years yeah it'll be long for me until things get warm again and i can walk my neighborhood or return to the skyways to walk around them yeah it's gonna take me a very long time so reaching level 40. so we had we had a viewer that came in twitch chat and they they said that they were they were upset that their significant other was like level 32 they bought the kanto fest tickets back in january it's your mistake starting out dating somebody who's not at least level 37. now come on put that on your match.com profile and that their significant other was bummed and frustrated that they had to be level 40. you know after four years of the game they're only level 32. and my response was well why'd you buy the ticket if you didn't know what the details were and their response was well they should have told us early and my response was well they did the event is uh they told us on the 9th the event is on the 20th so they gave you 11 days a heads up but yes if you bought the ticket in january you had no clue what it was supposed to be we had no clue how to get the mew yep and then i have this one i mean wait let me broken record for one second and say the same thing that i say every single time we hear one of these complaints you bought the ticket for the experience of the kanto day you did not buy the ticket for the shiny mew or the shiny ditto sorry it's the experience i will put an asterisk because they did say back on the 9th that you'll have special read research and then after completing that you'll get another quest line that will go to mu so we knew there was going to be two things yes we knew that we espresso research we knew that the first thing wasn't going to be like the the big concern of this was people were like i don't know if i can catch all 150 pokemon in a day and now i'm not going to get the mew it's clear that that's not it right collecting all 151 pokemon is going to be the like bragging rights or whatever right like it's not the thing you actually have to do um also if you don't definitely hit eight days because they're knocking them around they okay so here's the big thing that they like didn't actually say but if you go to support.niantic.com you do have to complete the pokemon go canto tour special research to get the masterwork research you do not have to finish it that day you can finish it at any point in time to unlock the masterwork research so even if you started the kanto research and then like six months later you finished it you then unlocked the masterwork research so this is what i was saying all along you're not not going to get the shiny mu you just have to do step one before step two now that being said it's just like the celebi research as in like you need to defeat team rocket to finish the celebrity research if team rocket is not spawning you can't do it but that doesn't mean you cannot get the celebi you just have to wait till team rocket comes back so if you don't finish the kanto special research on saturday they're giving you a kanto week after the event and if you don't finish it then you still can finish it later it's just going to be harder because it's probably going to rely on cantos spawns which are not guaranteed all the time this goes back to the original statement if you are worried about spending 12 dollars and not getting shiny mew you will get it you just have to you just have the best the the fastest path to complete it on saturday and a semi okay path to complete it the week after and a well it's going to live forever in your special research category if you don't finish it after that but you're not going to spend 12 and then they're gonna lock you out you're going to get the mew eventually and and i want to throw two things into the mix here number one greg and i are probably like the least amount of effort yeah put towards playing pokemon go that you can honestly put towards it and say i'm an active player and we've both made it to level 40. i've been level 40 for what two years now two and a half years and i honestly the majority of my pokemon go playing time is in the morning sending gifts to people because i enjoy letting people know that i'm thinking about them and i do for every single person that gets a gift from me in pokemon go i think about you a little bit as i send that gift so keep that in mind number one i think about you in as much as i know what your username is no no no no no no sometimes i look at the username and ago i i don't remember who you are i i think like oh you know i i wonder what cool thing you're doing in japan right now oh yeah i don't know here but if i do know who you are then i think like usually like a special memory like uh ryan in england has a new daughter and i think about she's so wonderful and i think about her and then there you go number two shiny mew is about the rarest of the rare pokemon that for for all the the shiny had they've made shiny getting shiny so easy for every other pokemon out there shiny mew is the rarest of the rare pokemon i want to work for it i want to earn it yeah i want this to be an actual challenge so i am all for it yes this needs to be a real challenge thank you i mean i get being disappointed right like it's going to take you longer having having crammed getting to level 40 in a month from nearing the end of 38 and then all the way up to 40. it's not it's not fun but it's also you know it took me half an hour a day of doing it i mean i get being disappointed but also they had said back in the eighth that there were going to be multiple steps to it and then also that was during their big push for you to get to 40 i don't know that having the 40 be a requirement was that much of a surprise because they really stressed all of november and december hey get to 40 by the end of the year and we'll give you special things without saying because you're gonna need to be at level 40. like they were pretty obvious about they felt getting to level 40 was important by the end of the year yeah and that's one of the main reasons why i did it because i'm like okay there is something coming that that is hinged on being level 40 because they they have never really pushed that level true very true until the end of last year yeah i didn't talk about that last night but i think that's like a super good point like this game has existed for we say five years it'll be five years in july there has been never a reason to get to 40. and they did make a big deal about it in december of like hey you want to get to level 40. not specifically because like there's anything that happens when you get to level 50 but if if you're going to have a game that has levels and the levels should like but if no one cares about getting to the levels then why have the levels yeah like levels should be there to push you to do something right the game should always ge games should give you a carrot on a stick to complete something and that now they have something that i feel personally is worthy of getting to 40. yeah oh absolutely yeah oh yeah i mean and i get it like being disappointed because you're not there yet and it's going to take you longer that is a very valid feeling right like you can feel disappointed about a lot of things and that's not to say that that's not valid but they aren't going to give everything away at the start and there does have to be some level of holding out to see is this event going to be really worth it because we talked about it like i had no i was not sure that when this was first announced that i wanted to pay this money for what they announced this event to be like even with the shiny mew at the end it was the main draw was because we had sort of agreed we're just gonna do it and i'm paying for that day but i was very hesitant about buying for the experience yes for that very reason because i just didn't know what was coming and i don't i don't think that's necessarily the fault of a company that wants to build excitement your disappointment i think people's disappointment that this is indeed what what you have to do and it does feel like a lot and you may live in an area where you can't hit 151 stops like there's a lot of reasons to be disappointed in that thing that they chose and that's okay to feel disappointed about that but also there's reasons to make that whole thing feel epic and the fact that you can just have it sitting in there for years and then finally things have loosened up and you're it you travel to new city and you do all the things and suddenly it happens for you that moment is still very exciting that you finally completed this epic journey i mean i think that's really what they wanted to give this so the initial like i mean i'll admit it looking at it thinking i have three months to walk all of these kilometers because generally going outside is unappealing for six of months of the year like yeah it's going to take me a long time to get there and that is disappointing that that's a hurdle that i have to cross but it'll feel great once i cross it and honestly reducing the counter argument down to its most basic level it's boy they've come up with this incredible reward that you have to work really hard you know you have to play the game really hard to get this incredible reward well no i just want them to give me the reward without playing the game well i think the thought process from some people is well i paid the twelve dollars just give it to me you're paying twelve dollars for the experience of playing the game it's like the standard pokemon it's the problem with people associating pokemon with money um and we'll never get away from it it's the same argument for the pokeball plus and it's so frustrating where like i mean they did that to themselves they have made that connection because things have come with i don't think they did like if you put out the pokeball plus which is a working controller it was 50 the the pokeball go plus was 35 so you're paying 15 more dollars for something that does what the 35 thing did plus it connects to the switch plus it connects to sword and shield plus it connects to let's go pikachu let's go eevee and then on top of that they were like well you know what let's give them a free mew like that is the thought process you are paying 50 for a piece of hardware that does what another piece of hardware does for 35 dollars but it also does more things and they were just being nice of giving them you but the pokemon fans are so backwards they can't comprehend that this is a working controller and they go oh it's 50 for a mew no the mew was just like the bonus thing they added on saying thank you for buying this cool controller we made that i still use every day like i think it i think that controller is a million percent worth fifty dollars and it is i love it yes i've been using it for years it's nice that it came with a mew but in no situation where i i was ever like well gosh why do they hide on you behind a 50 pay wall it is such backwards thinking like how can you discredit the entire product that they were like here's a free mew but like it's so weird to me that people think this way i don't think it's that weird i don't think it's that weird at all because that's a selling point of the thing like a million people would have looked at it and said i don't need that i don't need another controller i don't need this thing that does this one thing for this one game i don't really need that in my life oh it comes with a mew yeah that's enough to send me to buy that that's like that is great parts of me though why who's good because that's exactly a lot of people like it's a list of benefits and that's a thing that pushes you over it's like the same with a billion phones like i don't care about the camera i don't care about oh the screen resolution's better okay i'm getting that for that one thing yeah that's a good that's a good analogy i think i don't know people buy hacked pokemon off ebay yeah yeah yeah you're talking about people's thought processes of the list of things that pushes them over that's one of the things that pushes them over a lot of people thinking i have to collect 151 pokemon that i've been catching since the start of this game which is five years now is not worth it oh it leads me to this okay now that's probably worth it is a yet another list of benefits and when that benefit is the thing that sells you that's the thing that you associate with that cost if everything else again i've said this before if all the other things that you call our value ads aren't of value to you they don't matter the thing that adds the value is the thing that actually matters when you're making that decision so let's talk about how to get to 40 because because i did it in a month yes crack crack them lucky eggs do lots of rage i don't want to ever tell people to like spend money on lucky eggs to get to 40. they okay and this is what we talked about the other night they have made it significantly easier to get to level 40 over the years they didn't like they did make some changes recently to make it easier but the biggest thing that can get you to level 40 is the friendship stuff yep and that is that has been a feature that has existed for over a year and if you don't know how it works because uh i i i don't know that i have to explain this uh to some people on twitch but i'll explain it to some people in the podcast what happens is uh you can have 200 friends on your friends list and you can send and receive gifts and you get experience when you hit great friends ultra friends and best friends specifically you gain 10 000 experience which is the equivalent to one raid for opening gifts for seven days with a person and then you receive 50 000 experience for being 30-day friends with a person uh and then you for i think the last one is like 45 days or like 50 days or something all together it's like 90 days total um and then for best friends you get a hundred thousand experience for just sending and receiving gifts you don't even have to send them if you have somebody on your friend's list who loves sending gifts all you gotta do is open them pro tip again because people don't know this when you open a gift or when your friend opened it's a gift a little blue circle will appear around your friend meaning there has been some sort of interaction that day that means if you sent your friend a gift and they sent you a gift and they opened your gift you will see a blue circle which means you don't have to open their gift you can save it until the next day and then you can open it because you you both opening each other's gift the same day only accounts for one interaction you can only get one interaction a day with that friend if you're working to build that with a person for example if i was looking to build that with will will opens my gift on monday i open will's gift on tuesday will opens my gift on wednesday so we're both not opening the same gifts every day so we can stagger it so it's efficient as possible that means i can save those other gifts for other people or i can open other gifts from other people because you can only open 30 gifts a day you can send a hundred gifts a day now why i'm bringing this up because this is the best way to get experience if you picked 10 people and you were going to be best friends with those 10 people and if that is the point where you decide to pop a lucky egg which the lucky egg does work with so instead of ten thousand for great friends you're getting twenty thousand instead of getting fifty thousand for ultra friends you're getting a hundred thousand instead of getting a hundred thousand for best friends you're getting two hundred thousand some basic math here if you do this with ten people and you pop a lucky egg you're going to get 2 million xp that day in in in literal seconds because all it takes is opening 10 gifts or sending 10 gifts 2 million xp will get you from level 1 in pogo to level 30 in pogo instantly that is how much experience you're getting from just interacting with a friend feature and you'll want to interact with it because it gives you pokeballs it gives you potions it gives you berries they're literally free items if you have gotten to this point in pogo and you're not using that feature because you don't have friends that is like playing an mmo and literally not talking to a single person throughout your journey [Laughter] like you don't play final fantasy 14 because you're looking for a great single-player experience you're not logging into wild daily to never interact with another human being on the other hand there are people that do that they don't play for various are people that do that they're out of their minds but if you have twitter if you ain't a discord if you're in our slack community there are ways to find other people and you don't even need a lot like i said in my example that was just 10 people i know that i'm in a situation where like people want to be my friend i host a pokemon podcast it's very easy for me to put my friend code out and get like 50 requests on twitter very quickly i get it very privileged in that instance but i've also been that person where like no one knew who i'm at who i am i'm at a park in a raid and it's very easy just to be like hey does anyone want to exchange friend codes with your local group that's hard now because of the pandemic but i would strongly suggest to people who are not level 40 who are disappointed about this new event to start using the gift feature the other thing i want to bring up is they did change it the catching stuff to make it easier to get to level 40. so now if you get an excellent throw on a pokemon you get a thousand experience instead of a hundred so think about this if you catch 10 pokemon with excellent throws that is like catching 50 pokemon normally that didn't exist they introduced that in december so 50 pokemon is a lot of pokemon to catch it in the sense of that it's it's kind of time consuming because you got to throw the pokeball you gotta wait for it to shake you gotta go do the click you go through the thing if you get 10 excellent throws that's equivalent to catching 50 pokemon back in the older day they've definitely made it easier between friendship between experience all of december it was like double xp or whatever yeah i will say excellent throws aren't that easy to do excellent throws are not that easy you can get better at it being as bad as it is i i swear i hit it in there the game's like nope and and and the game will say oh that was the next info it breaks out i will throw the worst throw i have hits just barely on the edge of the ring catches frustrating that is frustrating there are some pokemon that are throws really good at excellent throws mr mimes kangaskhan now frauds nil uh nose pass snorlax lapras there are there so my advice would be figure out which pokemon you're really good at excellent throwing anytime you see those just i i look i am i i am an average pokemon player sometimes i see 10 pokemon in my house and i go i'm not catching any of these because i don't want to go through that more than average and then sometimes like this is wildly full of pokemon because you're near something and sometimes there's like four there's like four nidorans in my house and i do the thing i tap on all of them i go none of these are shiny but i don't bother on catching catching them i get it i'm there but there are some pokemon i know for sure i excellent throw those are always pokemon i catch no matter what because i know i can hit the excellent throw and it's very easy experience but again i get it it sucks that you're not level 40. i don't think it's the end of the world i do think that shiny mew should feel special i do think it should feel like an accomplishment you are still going to get it it might take time it's not the end of the world if it's not in your collection right away yeah also you get you get a higher first catch bonus in the morning so the first thing you catch also gets gives you more experience and the seven day experience is higher when they have they have closed that gap right you get a lot more from the seven day streak and you get a lot more for catching your first pokemon in the day it also is like that weird conversation that we've we we dance around which is like you have half of the people being like they make mythicals too easy nowaday they're just qr codes they're just they're just distributions and it's like they finally do something cool here whether or not you think it's cool or not because you have to be level 40. but they do make you work for it in a way and there is a story attached to this right because every time you complete in pogo every time you complete a research it walks you along a story and so they attached a whole story and event to this on top of attaching a whole story an event to the saturday thing so you're getting a lot for twelve dollars but i i get even though i disagree with that there are people that are thinking i don't care about any of that and the twelve dollars is just specifically for this mew and nothing else associated with it what is the expression it's like you can you can disappoint some of the people some of the time but you can't disappoint all of the people i don't know that it's disappointing oh it is in this context i mean you everybody's experiences will will vary based off of your expectations that is that is a common life stressor the further something is away from what you expected it to be the gap between the two is your just happiness and stress there's not a lot to do about that like learn this time make decisions like if your decision is never to play pokemon go again that is your decision and it's a valid decision because you're the smart decision i mean your experience was negative and they have shown their hand multiple times this is how they run this company this is how they run this game this is how they do events i don't think this is necessarily bad in the sense of like it's not like if you think about it in a content form like people are always desperate people always want new content like look at people who still talk about pokemon quest oh i wish there would be gen 2 for pokemon quest yeah i mean i guess like i don't know like how like i think of it in a sense of like okay what would adding 100 pokemon do like yeah i guess you can like collect them but it's still like the same like pokemon quest i think was like a very good package like it didn't overstay its welcome it was very delightful it was very fun i don't think adding more pokemon for a paid monetary cost would be like a good enough reason to go back to it unless they dramatically change something it's not a good enough reason for you but in a sense for like pokemon go you're paying 12.99 you're getting an a 12 hour event you're getting a shiny ditto at the end of it when you complete it but you're you're getting that entire experience and they're giving you more content that you can just do throughout however long it's going to take you a week two weeks two months a year like you are they're giving you content to keep you playing their game and ideally hopefully i would assume you're playing your their game because you like their game so it's kind of weird to be like ugh i wish they would just give me the shiny mew yeah but then what are you gonna do not play the game that you're hopefully like to play like i i it's kind of like a double-edged sword almost because they're giving you content and if if shiny mew being probably the thing that people wanted the most outside of pokemon go and in pokemon go right like it's not like so this is not a wanted thing exclusive to pokemon go people who play sword and shield also want shiny mew like they're giving you a lot of cut like they're giving you a reason to play the game i don't know it's just i guess they can just get you just pay it they give it to you and you go okay well now i have nothing to do i don't i don't know it just i it's hard for me to see it as like a huge complaint but also i'm level 40 so i don't know how it would be like but i'm level 40 because i like playing go yeah i mean i i will i will be the person that does not particularly like playing go i check in because i do like it is just a habit it's a thing i do there are days with trying to push to 40 in december actively made me hate that game and i didn't play for a week after because that level of grind and the level of demand that something that's supposed to be fun was putting on me wasn't fun so i get it like having to having to basically grind your way through a level to start to the thing you want isn't fun grinding isn't fun and it's also true that like they're not just gonna give it away they just aren't they are going to build in things to make you play that game and if that if that attitude is something you can't stand then don't like how they're gonna run this game isn't for you and that is a fine breaking point like whenever you see the money behind it and it's not fun you're just seeing the money then you're probably done with the game because it's it's too much of a burden and i i mean i agree pushing to 40 in december was bad for me i did not enjoy it i resented the game i resented what i had to do i resented the mechanics more than i ever have in that game when they didn't work so i i get that i get that having to grind to a certain level to get what you want is not a fun experience it is fun for some people a lot of people love that i mean people grind in games all the time because the end reward is great i gr i have literally run the same dungeons and raids in final fantasy 14 for five months now because i enjoy the people that i play with i enjoy working towards the rewards at the end and i still enjoy that experience but i have hit the wall in many games where i've realized this is just a grind and i'm not enjoying this anymore and i've left that value slides for us for many many people do we end with don't pay money for something you don't know the full details about i mean that is just that is just a buyer's beware in general like don't pre-order something if you don't know how it's going to work like unless you're absolutely rock solid and exact like you know oh it's it is this thing and i know exactly what they're going to do with it like never pre-order if you're at all questioning it on any product any any anything let's make it pokemon go specific now did they say only a limited number of people can buy this event too no no no yeah there was unlimited supply guess what wait until the day before it happens yeah if you ain't tickled the day before it happens then don't i guess you could maybe be like well i wanted the community day for january i wanted the community for february but then once again you got two experiences for thirteen dollars you got what you paid for yeah but yeah i agree i i don't agree with you well but also you didn't even know what those communities were so like is the thought process you were gonna buy them anyways like i don't know i i have purchased every single one because i like the only reason why i have i did the mod match up ones because i bought this ticket i probably would not have and guess what i didn't do the machop one because i was asleep through the whole thing and you know what heart is still not broken i would have of the ones i would have purchased the rosalia one because i love that pokemon today oh heck yeah but i haven't had a great day together but i haven't done a lot of the special researches for those others days like me buying the kanto ticket was not those those free research days were not a part of that equation i i would have wouldn't have purchased them depending on what the day is and i wouldn't have purchased the january one but still fundamentally if something is unlimited supply wait until you absolutely have to buy it unlimited supply and no cutoff date like you can buy it up until the day of the event you can buy it during it yeah just wait i mean i i hope people have fun this weekend i mean i plan on having fun this weekend i mean yeah i i think you can have a good time like i think i mean i'm not super looking forward to playing indoors no uh specifically around other people but we may have a miracle hot front we may come through we might supply our other option was to go to texas and play outdoors yeah but uh boy it sounds like that would have been a just as bad decision because it's about 20 degrees out in texas right now i mean i will say this saturday is predicted to be 23 which is toasty that is a that's shorts weather man minnesota heatwave it is i mean i wouldn't mind being outside it for shorter periods of time after this after these two weeks i know for sure though i like regardless of money or regardless of being level 40 i know for sure i would not have fun with this event if i was sitting in my house for 12 hours absolutely i wouldn't have done it if we hadn't made plans we have we have a couple options if some don't work but yep my fingers are crossed i like to be an opportunist we know that but i think you mean you like to be an optimist and an opportunist mostly you know you're an opportunist that is well proven but your positive attitude is the thing you're trying to highlight right i don't know i'm not even touching this i don't know it is actually well um is that our show is that everything we should i mean i'm assuming since we've been yelling at each other for this long we're skipping question of the week but we still should do pokemon of the week yeah let me just check the slack real quick so we give people their dues uh there was the military event this weekend yep it was the third two shiny milks third time third week in a row they've done an event i don't think there's much to say about it it's kind of the same i would expect there would be an event not this up oh gosh hopefully not this upcoming weekend but i would exp i would soon expect there would be an event at the end of the month for pokemon day um lewis was the one that sent in from our slack community about the addressing the pokemon tcg so thank you luis for that uh and then i i think i think that's it there was some news posted in slack but it's not and we we can save it until next week not dire oh we didn't talk about the umbrella stuff again not dire uh we need stuff to talk about on thursday yeah yeah yeah yeah save it save it for thursday i got a rant for that oh umbrella stuff umbrella they made pokemon rumble oh oh oh oh oh oh oh i thought you meant like bumper shoots i had no idea what either one of you is talking about okay well give us pokemon of the week so i thought that last week's pokemon was going to be challenging but several people did come up with the correct answer so i feel like my clues were justified and as the translation i will say uh number one i referenced greg because greg is brent's husband um and greg's favorite pokemon is roselia and then i said look at the starters and there's only one pokemon without requiring a hidden ability which a lot of people for whatever reason didn't hear those words or being related to a camel which everybody seemed to hear that one uh that is the exact opposite of this pokemon um so and then everybody a lot of people were like well if rosalia is grass poison then water is the opposite of uh of grass and then i was like but i referenced the camo pokemon and there's only so many camel pokemon and then that would clearly be fire so i must have meant that fire is the opposite of grass uh and then i said well whatever and then i said you may need to consult with an oracle to find the answer and this is where my real disappointment was because to me if somebody says oracle i think of one thing and i guess kids these days don't you think of the software company no database company thank you oh well whatever i think all right are we going to have steve's bad guest sure all right it's mr mime oh yuck no it's del fox i mean i guess ice psychic is the opposite of brazil yeah it could be it it's not starter so yeah uh correct it is del fox because when i think of oracle i think of the oracle of delphi from ancient greece which is kind of where we get that term from uh and the pokemon that requires a hidden ability to be fire psychic is darmanitan which is always one of my favorite ones to think of because it was like that one weird one where you could get the hidden ability ones that were standing outside of the palace or temple or whatever in the desert and like those were the only ones that you could get at that point in time uh either way del fox is one of my favorite pokemon i love dale fox so much the shuffle icon is brilliant and the shiny is amazing why is the shiny amazing it's like got this cool purple dress and the fur is gray it just looks so great it's like a really cool uh like it makes it more spooky and is it a dress or a robe yeah it's a robe it's a robe yeah uh delphi is the only star pokemon to have psychic type uh dell fox and its pre-evolved form share the category with vulpix nine tails nikkit and thievel they are all known as the fox pokemon is your trivia all right pokemon for this week i don't know [Laughter] all right let me go let me go the tradition of exchanging cards on saint valentine's day has its origins somewhere in medieval times but really took off in 1913 when hallmark cards of kansas city missouri began mass production of valentines honestly if we are ever concerned with the over commercialization of any holiday the dark specter of hallmark can typically be found lurking in the shadows our pokemon this week lost three grams on route 13 in univa between lacunosa and andella towns and adjacent to the giant chasm you cannot catch the pokemon that drops the three grams even after you track down and return all three but it will give you tm 89 as a thank you before it flies away this is the only way an original pokemon black and white to obtain the tm for u-turn fans of pokemon mystery dungeon at the very least the rescue team versions may be a bit confused in those games it is this pokemon's evolution that provides the mail delivery service there you go not too hard not not too hard this week okay we'll be back next week well technically later this week but it'll be for next week uh we'll be back next week uh there will be little to no pogo coverage because obviously we're recording beforehand i will be streaming monday tuesday wednesday this week on twitch and then i'll be off uh because i will be visiting will and greg yay safely hopefully i ordered a bunch of new masks hopefully they arrived before ooh i have a lot of masks i'm gonna get that double up action going well no i i mean i'm gonna wash my current mask i just wanted some new ones it's like when i like to travel i like to get a new hoodie this is this is not good hoodies you have too many hoods yeah but once you wash a hoodie it like loses something wait you like you wash it one time it loses dirt and you're st and you're you're funk your stinky stinky funk what that's what my wife likes what how often are you washing hoodies like not once two weeks or so what's the use it depends on what i used it for if i used it at the gym heck yeah i wash it once a year yeah but if you're just like wearing a lounge hoodie over like your shirts
