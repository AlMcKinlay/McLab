yeah things that end in zero especially (0:36 - 0:40)
five zeroes (0:39 - 0:43)

host sbj (0:50 - 0:55)
greg here the fiveist of zeros i am the (0:51 - 0:56)
fivest of zeros (0:55 - 0:59)
i guess if in a scale of one to ten i'm (0:56 - 1:00)
a fifty (0:59 - 1:02)
that what we're saying yeah yeah yeah (1:00 - 1:03)
yeah it's a compliment (1:02 - 1:05)

rest of the year you have to give me (1:37 - 1:39)

to party (1:42 - 1:46)
hardcore for our nice lunar new year (1:43 - 1:48)
celebration (1:46 - 1:51)

down to this for like five weeks now (2:38 - 2:42)
it's been it's been like four months (2:40 - 2:43)
forever it's been (2:42 - 2:45)
i've been counting down since i don't (2:43 - 2:47)
know 1990 (2:45 - 2:50)
i couldn't find the exact date of when (2:47 - 2:52)
they initially announced this but it was (2:50 - 2:55)
the end of december beginning of january (2:52 - 2:57)
isn't it in their giant list of (2:55 - 2:59)
updates have you looked at that giant (2:57 - 3:00)
list of updates (2:59 - 3:03)
i mean december 1 celebrate the arrival (3:00 - 3:04)
pokemon it was discovered in (3:03 - 3:07)
kayla's with a special event like i can (3:04 - 3:08)
find a lot of things in here (3:07 - 3:09)
are we just looking for the first time (3:08 - 3:11)
they said hey we're doing a kanto thing (3:09 - 3:13)
yeah i couldn't figure out the first (3:11 - 3:14)
time they said i figured out the first (3:13 - 3:15)
time they said like the countdown which (3:14 - 3:17)
was unova week (3:15 - 3:18)
because they started with unova and then (3:17 - 3:21)
cinno and we know the rest (3:18 - 3:24)
so that's coming this weekend uh we're (3:21 - 3:25)
going to talk about that later in the (3:24 - 3:26)
show (3:25 - 3:28)
and then the following weekend which is (3:26 - 3:30)
february (3:28 - 3:32)
where's my calendar february 27th which (3:30 - 3:34)
is a saturday (3:32 - 3:38)
uh is pokemon day though i would expect (3:34 - 3:41)
some announcements friday evening if (3:38 - 3:42)
those announcements are (3:41 - 3:46)
uh japanese related so for example (3:42 - 3:47)
if we want to look at any kind of (3:46 - 3:49)
patterns normally (3:47 - 3:51)
a pokemon movie for japan is announced (3:49 - 3:53)
that day but not announced for us (3:51 - 3:54)
because they normally get their movies (3:53 - 3:57)
in june we get our movies in (3:54 - 4:01)
whenever whenever (3:57 - 4:03)
later in the year but because of covet (4:01 - 4:04)
i'm sure (4:03 - 4:06)
that might throw things off so who knows (4:04 - 4:07)
if they're gonna announce a movie (4:06 - 4:08)
we still don't even know when this rude (4:07 - 4:10)
movie is coming for us although i do (4:08 - 4:12)
expect (4:10 - 4:17)
the old netflix release date next week (4:12 - 4:20)
so next week uh next week's pot this is (4:17 - 4:21)
weird because (4:20 - 4:23)
we're gonna be recording before the (4:21 - 4:24)
kanto (4:23 - 4:26)
tour we're gonna be recording thursday (4:24 - 4:28)
so i can get it edited because i'll be (4:26 - 4:30)
on the road friday and sunday (4:28 - 4:33)
and then playing all day on saturday (4:30 - 4:33)
with greg and will (4:33 - 4:36)
very excited uh so we won't have our (4:33 - 4:38)
thoughts for the canto tour (4:36 - 4:40)
on the the episode that comes out on the (4:38 - 4:41)
22nd next week (4:40 - 4:44)
uh we'll save our thoughts for the i (4:41 - 4:45)
don't think there's going to be like a (4:44 - 4:47)
lot of thoughts there will probably be (4:45 - 4:48)
some ups and some downs and you know (4:47 - 4:50)
20-minute conversation and we'll move on (4:48 - 4:50)
but (4:50 - 4:52)
you don't know what stories we're gonna (4:50 - 4:54)
generate when the three of us are (4:52 - 4:55)
together (4:54 - 4:57)
in one location look i am going to find (4:55 - 4:59)
that door of the explorer pokestop and (4:57 - 5:01)
i'm going to stock up on (4:59 - 5:04)
it's closed dude i can reach it (5:01 - 5:07)
i don't have to be next to it to to spin (5:04 - 5:08)
the stop (5:07 - 5:10)
i need to stock up on those gifts so i (5:08 - 5:12)
can send people dora the explorer and (5:10 - 5:13)
swiper (5:12 - 5:14)

and the (5:19 - 5:22)
lego dragon which is awesome lego dragon (5:20 - 5:23)

okay so here's the plan we're going to (5:23 - 5:26)
talk about some tcg stuff we're going to (5:25 - 5:27)
talk about the pokemon go stuff and we (5:26 - 5:28)
have a bunch of other stuff to talk (5:27 - 5:29)
about that's going to be the episode (5:28 - 5:32)
a lot to work through here let's start (5:29 - 5:33)
off with (5:32 - 5:35)
the an article from polygon (5:33 - 5:37)
[Music] (5:35 - 5:40)
titled the pokemon happy meals are at (5:37 - 5:41)
mcdonald's are getting ruined by (5:40 - 5:45)
greedy adults like you (5:41 - 5:48)
edmund ruined admit it it's you (5:45 - 5:50)
you are the culprit you're because i the (5:48 - 5:52)
villain (5:50 - 5:55)
photos i did buy pokemon cards yeah (5:52 - 5:57)
this is this is like a tough full (5:55 - 5:59)
disclosure here i did buy some happy (5:57 - 6:00)
meals (5:59 - 6:02)
some i went did you buy happy meals or (6:00 - 6:04)
did you buy the packs of cards without (6:02 - 6:05)
the meal (6:04 - 6:07)
okay what do you what do you want you (6:05 - 6:08)
want my story first or you want this (6:07 - 6:09)
article we should probably read the (6:08 - 6:12)
article first (6:09 - 6:12)
select mcdonald's are celebrating the (6:12 - 6:15)
25th anniversary of pokemon with a (6:14 - 6:17)
promotion that turns the iconic happy (6:15 - 6:19)
meal box into a pikachu face (6:17 - 6:22)
bundled with the pikachu face container (6:19 - 6:24)
there are 50 collectible cards (6:22 - 6:26)
25 are hollow 25 or not it doesn't say (6:24 - 6:27)
this in the article i'm (6:26 - 6:29)
i'm filling in the blanks here for the (6:27 - 6:31)
author (6:29 - 6:31)
uh pokemon cards are a hot commodity (6:32 - 6:35)
that's true (6:34 - 6:37)
that fans are having a hard time finding (6:35 - 6:39)
booster packs at big retailers also true (6:37 - 6:41)
nearly every week there's a new broken (6:39 - 6:42)
record for the dollars that people are (6:41 - 6:44)
spending for old school packs (6:42 - 6:46)
also true mcdonald's promotion in other (6:44 - 6:47)
words never stood a chance (6:46 - 6:49)
we said this on this podcast yes folks (6:47 - 6:51)
are waking up early to stake out (6:49 - 6:52)
mcdonald's uh that are selling happy (6:51 - 6:53)
meals some (6:52 - 6:55)
are apparently buying happy meals in (6:53 - 6:56)
mass numbers in hopes of getting the (6:55 - 6:58)
collectibles and throwing out the food (6:56 - 6:59)
i'm sure that's happening i haven't seen (6:58 - 7:01)
that happen but i'm sure that is (6:59 - 7:01)
happening (7:01 - 7:03)
i guarantee it's happening some (7:01 - 7:05)
mcdonald's are even placing restrictions (7:03 - 7:06)
on buying happy meals (7:05 - 7:08)
scalpers are reportedly already turning (7:06 - 7:10)
around and selling individual cards at a (7:08 - 7:10)
markup (7:10 - 7:13)
oh gosh there's a lot to talk about here (7:10 - 7:14)
if you don't (7:13 - 7:16)
like pokemon tcg cards it's just the (7:14 - 7:17)
interesting dynamic (7:16 - 7:20)
of like what is actually happening here (7:17 - 7:21)
um some customers are going around to (7:20 - 7:23)
multiple restaurants that was me (7:21 - 7:26)
uh unable to find a happy meal also me (7:23 - 7:26)
uh (7:26 - 7:29)
on websites like ebay entire boxes of (7:26 - 7:30)
cards are being uh (7:29 - 7:32)
sealed and going for hundreds of dollars (7:30 - 7:33)
i literally (7:32 - 7:36)
spent three hours on my twitch stream (7:33 - 7:37)
looking at ebay prices for this stuff (7:36 - 7:39)
the day this happened it was very (7:37 - 7:39)
interesting (7:39 - 7:41)
we reached out to a comment to (7:39 - 7:44)
mcdonald's and mcdonald's told polygon (7:41 - 7:45)
the following (7:44 - 7:47)
quote with significant demand for our (7:45 - 7:49)
promotional pokemon tcg and some fans (7:47 - 7:51)
even going to extreme lakes to get them (7:49 - 7:52)
we are working quickly to address the (7:51 - 7:53)
shortage and (7:52 - 7:55)
also strongly encouraging restaurants to (7:53 - 7:57)
set a reasonable limit on happy meals (7:55 - 8:00)
sold per customer we want to offer the (7:57 - 8:02)
full happy meal experience to as many (8:00 - 8:03)
families as possible (8:02 - 8:06)
to ensure everyone is able to get in on (8:03 - 8:06)
the fun (8:06 - 8:08)
i do like the the wording they have here (8:06 - 8:10)
where do we start well i will say one (8:08 - 8:12)
i since i didn't jump in when we were (8:10 - 8:14)
talking about wasting food uh the one (8:12 - 8:16)
person i saw on my facebook (8:14 - 8:20)
who did get uh 15 happy meals at one (8:16 - 8:21)
location got all (8:20 - 8:24)
nugget meals because then they could (8:21 - 8:26)
redo like the nuggets in their air fryer (8:24 - 8:28)
rather than throwing them away so it (8:26 - 8:29)
wasn't wasteful (8:28 - 8:31)
oh but what about the fries you eat (8:29 - 8:32)
those fries as fast as possible i was (8:31 - 8:33)
just (8:32 - 8:35)
saying are you sitting on fries no no no (8:33 - 8:39)
no no right down the gullet (8:35 - 8:39)
bags from uh good size they're small (8:40 - 8:44)
yeah they're kid size uh so (8:42 - 8:46)
i i went to ten different mcdonald's the (8:44 - 8:47)
day it came out (8:46 - 8:50)
i went with my friend tim he drove (8:47 - 8:50)
because (8:50 - 8:53)
look my friend tim has a tesla he looks (8:50 - 8:54)
for any reason in the world to drive (8:53 - 8:55)
around (8:54 - 8:57)
[Laughter] (8:55 - 8:59)
knowing tim this is no surprise (8:57 - 9:01)
whatsoever (8:59 - 9:05)
i will buy that 100 yes i called them up (9:01 - 9:07)
i said hey i want to go to mcdonald's i (9:05 - 9:07)
want to (9:07 - 9:10)
film it for youtube and i just think it (9:07 - 9:11)
would be fun to see (9:10 - 9:13)
like because we we know that every (9:11 - 9:14)
mcdonald's is different (9:13 - 9:16)
every mcdonald's has their own rules (9:14 - 9:18)
their own restrictions (9:16 - 9:20)
see if we can get my goal was to get (9:18 - 9:22)
like 15 packs of cards (9:20 - 9:24)
and i figured if i got 15 packs i'd at (9:22 - 9:27)
least complete the 25 collection (9:24 - 9:28)
i wouldn't get all the hollows but i'd (9:27 - 9:30)
at least be close and then (9:28 - 9:32)
the last like couple hollows i'm missing (9:30 - 9:33)
i'll just buy them off (9:32 - 9:35)
tcgplayer for however much they're going (9:33 - 9:36)
for and i don't think (9:35 - 9:40)
15 packs of cards is unreasonable (9:36 - 9:41)
i don't want to spoil the video that'll (9:40 - 9:43)
come out this coming friday (9:41 - 9:46)
which is the 19th but every mcdonald's (9:43 - 9:47)
had different rules like the first (9:46 - 9:48)
mcdonald's we went to (9:47 - 9:50)
they were like we can't sell you the (9:48 - 9:52)
packs we know that like (9:50 - 9:54)
okay so let me back up every mcdonald's (9:52 - 9:55)
knew about pokemon they (9:54 - 9:57)
they like knew before we got like they (9:55 - 9:58)
they were warned (9:57 - 10:01)
they were well ahead of time i'm sure (9:58 - 10:03)
plenty of people already arrived before (10:01 - 10:05)
us trying to look for these cards (10:03 - 10:07)
anyways the first mcdonald's said this (10:05 - 10:09)
they said you can buy as many happy (10:07 - 10:10)
meals as you want (10:09 - 10:13)
and we will sell you two extra packs of (10:10 - 10:13)
cards (10:13 - 10:15)
but there was no limit on happy meals (10:13 - 10:17)
and so i was like okay (10:15 - 10:20)
that mcdonald's is really close to where (10:17 - 10:20)
this is (10:20 - 10:22)
i didn't want any food to go to waste (10:20 - 10:24)
and i did want (10:22 - 10:26)
like my thought process at this very (10:24 - 10:27)
first mcdonald's is like (10:26 - 10:28)
i don't know if other mcdonald's are (10:27 - 10:30)
gonna have these i'll take (10:28 - 10:33)
five happy meals i'm gonna eat one tim's (10:30 - 10:34)
gonna eat one (10:33 - 10:36)
or and then there's two homeless people (10:34 - 10:37)
over well (10:36 - 10:39)
spoiler tim didn't eat any there's two (10:37 - 10:40)
homeless people over like (10:39 - 10:42)
two blocks away that are always on this (10:40 - 10:44)
corner and we're gonna drop the happy (10:42 - 10:46)
meals off over there (10:44 - 10:47)
and then that way i got seven packs from (10:46 - 10:49)
that very first mcdonald's i bought five (10:47 - 10:51)
they sold me two extra the second (10:49 - 10:53)
mcdonald's was like (10:51 - 10:54)
we're only we're only selling with happy (10:53 - 10:57)
meals and i was like okay no thanks i (10:54 - 10:57)
don't need i don't (10:57 - 10:59)
i already got rid of the food don't need (10:57 - 11:01)
any more food don't eat it i i cannot (10:59 - 11:03)
possibly eat any more fries right now (11:01 - 11:06)
the third mcdonald's was the same like (11:03 - 11:07)
you had to buy happy meals (11:06 - 11:10)
okay next mcdonald's was you can buy one (11:07 - 11:11)
pack of cards (11:10 - 11:12)
if you want more you gotta buy the happy (11:11 - 11:14)
meal but we'll sell you one pack of (11:12 - 11:15)
carts cool i'll take the one pack of (11:14 - 11:16)
cards third mcdonald's was like we don't (11:15 - 11:18)
even have any cards anymore or fourth (11:16 - 11:19)
mcdonald's like we don't have anything i (11:18 - 11:19)
have cards (11:19 - 11:21)
so every what the point i'm saying is (11:19 - 11:22)
every mcdonald's was different which i (11:21 - 11:24)
show in the video (11:22 - 11:26)
i fundamental maybe because i am an (11:24 - 11:27)
adult buying cards (11:26 - 11:30)
i agree with like mcdonald's is getting (11:27 - 11:31)
ruined by greedy (11:30 - 11:33)
well okay i do i unless they're (11:31 - 11:35)
specifically talking about scalpers (11:33 - 11:37)
yes but i there's like this thing going (11:35 - 11:38)
around on social media where (11:37 - 11:39)
like other people think they're better (11:38 - 11:41)
than other people for not buying happy (11:39 - 11:42)
meals (11:41 - 11:45)
like this is not look i've i've been (11:42 - 11:45)
buying (11:45 - 11:48)
i've i've purchased my gold in my closet (11:45 - 11:50)
sitting next to my ancient mew (11:48 - 11:53)
my gold burger king pokemon cards when i (11:50 - 11:54)
was a kid (11:53 - 11:57)
i have purchased my like every other (11:54 - 11:58)
happy meal (11:57 - 12:00)
i've been doing this for 25 years (11:58 - 12:02)
there's not all of a sudden like (12:00 - 12:05)
i i hit a certain age where i'm not (12:02 - 12:06)
allowed to participate (12:05 - 12:08)
in cars it's not yeah it's not (12:06 - 12:10)
restricted to pokemon but (12:08 - 12:12)
but here's the real thing right you're (12:10 - 12:14)
looking at it from the perspective of (12:12 - 12:17)
they're shaming me because i'm too old (12:14 - 12:20)
to be buying happy meals right this this (12:17 - 12:24)
the real ruse here and it's the real (12:20 - 12:27)
twisting of the facts is they're putting (12:24 - 12:28)
into the (12:27 - 12:32)
the general imagination that there are (12:28 - 12:35)
thousands of crying children in the (12:32 - 12:36)
world (12:35 - 12:38)
because those children couldn't get the (12:36 - 12:40)
pokemon (12:38 - 12:42)
uh happy meal that they so desperately (12:40 - 12:44)
needed the minute they woke up (12:42 - 12:46)
well number one you told your kid that (12:44 - 12:48)
there was a pokemon happy meal if that's (12:46 - 12:49)
truly the case where you could have (12:48 - 12:52)
not commercialized your child and number (12:49 - 12:53)
two oh come on (12:52 - 12:56)
kids aren't that like infatuated (12:53 - 12:58)
yes kids love pokemon but they're not (12:56 - 13:00)
like oh if i don't get that (12:58 - 13:02)
pokemon happy meal my life is going to (13:00 - 13:05)
be ruined for the next you know 50 years (13:02 - 13:09)
kids are like that i mean kids will say (13:05 - 13:09)
that like (13:09 - 13:13)
we we as adults know that's not true (13:09 - 13:16)
but in the moment with that screeching (13:13 - 13:18)
toddler who isn't getting what they want (13:16 - 13:21)
that that is a real situation like they (13:18 - 13:23)
had that expectation they aren't getting (13:21 - 13:23)
it (13:23 - 13:26)
we know they will forget in a week (13:23 - 13:28)
but you are still dealing with that (13:26 - 13:30)
child and i think (13:28 - 13:33)
it's not so much if it wasn't for (13:30 - 13:36)
the i'm buying a giant pack and putting (13:33 - 13:37)
it up on ebay (13:36 - 13:39)
if it wasn't for the scalping if it (13:37 - 13:41)
wasn't for (13:39 - 13:43)
people going and saying i've just (13:41 - 13:45)
purchased all of this mcdonald's (13:43 - 13:49)
happy meal stock and are out because (13:45 - 13:52)
i decided to buy them all i think that's (13:49 - 13:53)
where we start treading (13:52 - 13:57)
on the okay what are you going for and (13:53 - 13:59)
why are you buying some money because (13:57 - 14:02)
if it's for collection you like (13:59 - 14:04)
you know as well as everybody else that (14:02 - 14:06)
they will go up for sale (14:04 - 14:09)
later is the idea that you want to cash (14:06 - 14:10)
in quick (14:09 - 14:12)
right now by making it a scarce (14:10 - 14:15)
commodity and then flipping it around (14:12 - 14:18)
i think that that is that is sort of (14:15 - 14:20)
the part where adults with a lot of (14:18 - 14:21)
money are (14:20 - 14:24)
creating a market that we know isn't (14:21 - 14:24)
real (14:24 - 14:27)
yeah right and uh and that's a problem i (14:24 - 14:29)
get it i get it from both sides right (14:27 - 14:31)
i am not going to shame somebody who's (14:29 - 14:33)
been collecting pokemon cards for 20 (14:31 - 14:35)
plus years to be like oh you (14:33 - 14:37)
you can't possibly buy a happy meal (14:35 - 14:38)
what's wrong with you (14:37 - 14:41)
it's the same food it's a it's a it's (14:38 - 14:42)
it's all that (14:41 - 14:44)
it's a cheese river and fries it's no (14:42 - 14:46)
different than ordering a cheeseburger (14:44 - 14:47)
and fries the only difference (14:46 - 14:49)
is you're paying a premium for them to (14:47 - 14:52)
put a toy in it and that toy is (14:49 - 14:54)
pokemon cards they're not unique to the (14:52 - 14:56)
things that are on target they're (14:54 - 14:58)
literally reprinted at the same cards so (14:56 - 15:00)
like one this is what they've stated (14:58 - 15:01)
this is what they state for literally (15:00 - 15:03)
every happy meal not every mcdonald's (15:01 - 15:04)
gets the same amount (15:03 - 15:06)
depends on how much you sell where your (15:04 - 15:07)
mcdonald's is located (15:06 - 15:10)
but i do understand if you live in like (15:07 - 15:12)
i i don't know (15:10 - 15:14)
i wasn't gonna say sheboygan wisconsin (15:12 - 15:15)
sheboygan's kind of big uh (15:14 - 15:17)
if you live in like oconomowoc wisconsin (15:15 - 15:19)
and they got one mcdonald's (15:17 - 15:21)
and some scalper goes and they buy out (15:19 - 15:23)
all the happy meals (15:21 - 15:26)
yes that does suck for that specific (15:23 - 15:28)
town because i only have one mcdonald's (15:26 - 15:29)
i get it (15:28 - 15:33)
that is not restricted to pokemon stuff (15:29 - 15:35)
that is whatever is in demand like (15:33 - 15:37)
mcdonald's has had beanie babies (15:35 - 15:39)
same thing happened and the same (15:37 - 15:41)
complaints happened then (15:39 - 15:43)
so yep same complaints happened then i (15:41 - 15:45)
live in milwaukee wisconsin (15:43 - 15:49)
we have probably 40 mcdonald's (15:45 - 15:51)
yeah at one point i had a map going to (15:49 - 15:54)
all 40 it would have taken six hours (15:51 - 15:56)
to drive well how wait wouldn't you have (15:54 - 15:58)
to recharge the tesla (15:56 - 16:00)
yeah yeah see we could we could only go (15:58 - 16:03)
to 10 on the tesla battery (16:00 - 16:03)
get wreck tesla okay the the other (16:04 - 16:08)
problem (16:07 - 16:11)
that the other thing that i saw which (16:08 - 16:12)
again is just (16:11 - 16:14)
not maybe understanding the situation is (16:12 - 16:15)
like people (16:14 - 16:17)
yelling at mcdonald's of like why why (16:15 - 16:19)
would you release these cards now when (16:17 - 16:19)
they were about (16:19 - 16:23)
they were bound to fail there is no way (16:19 - 16:24)
that a billion dollar company like (16:23 - 16:26)
pokemon and another billion dollar (16:24 - 16:27)
company like mcdonald's (16:26 - 16:30)
decided this program this promotion two (16:27 - 16:32)
weeks ago (16:30 - 16:34)
oh absolutely the cards had to be (16:32 - 16:36)
designed pikachu on the card is unique (16:34 - 16:40)
i would i would safely assume that this (16:36 - 16:40)
promotion (16:40 - 16:44)
was was probably designed (16:40 - 16:47)
before vivid voltage came out which was (16:44 - 16:48)
like vivid watches (16:47 - 16:50)
was like four or five four months ago i (16:48 - 16:52)
think and when vivid voltage (16:50 - 16:54)
came out you could still buy vivid (16:52 - 16:55)
voltage (16:54 - 16:57)
for like the two weeks the first two (16:55 - 16:59)
weeks vivid voltage debuted (16:57 - 17:01)
you could walk into a target you could (16:59 - 17:03)
buy packs you could go on cool stuff inc (17:01 - 17:05)
or troll and toad and you could get a (17:03 - 17:06)
booster box for (17:05 - 17:09)
99 and it was wasn't only (17:06 - 17:11)
it was about two to three weeks after (17:09 - 17:13)
after vivid voltage came out which is (17:11 - 17:15)
when the logan paul (17:13 - 17:18)
twenty thousand dollar charizard box and (17:15 - 17:18)
then (17:18 - 17:21)
the the supply and demand and people ran (17:18 - 17:22)
out (17:21 - 17:24)
and all pokemon cards are sold out if (17:22 - 17:26)
you're one of the the few people posting (17:24 - 17:28)
on social media very upset that this is (17:26 - 17:29)
like mcdonald's fault (17:28 - 17:32)
no it's just timing like it wasn't even (17:29 - 17:34)
vivid voltage's fault (17:32 - 17:36)
because again when vivid voltage came (17:34 - 17:37)
out you could just get it it was very (17:36 - 17:39)
easy to get now it's very hard to get (17:37 - 17:41)
they didn't print enough vivid voltage (17:39 - 17:43)
they definitely printed enough of xy (17:41 - 17:44)
evolutions because xy (17:43 - 17:46)
evolutions finally sold out after five (17:44 - 17:48)
years of existing (17:46 - 17:50)
uh they finally sold out because of this (17:48 - 17:51)
tcg (17:50 - 17:54)
craze if for whatever reason the (17:51 - 17:56)
pandemic didn't happen (17:54 - 17:58)
and people weren't sitting at home with (17:56 - 18:00)
extra money because this is something (17:58 - 18:01)
i've explained in my twitch stream this (18:00 - 18:05)
like the tcg fad will crash once (18:01 - 18:06)
the pandemic is over because what (18:05 - 18:08)
happens is people will move their money (18:06 - 18:09)
elsewhere (18:08 - 18:11)
if i have extra money because i'm not (18:09 - 18:12)
going to baseball games (18:11 - 18:15)
i'm not going to concerts i'm not (18:12 - 18:17)
traveling the world i'm not taking a (18:15 - 18:19)
trip to puerto rico (18:17 - 18:21)
i'm not going to fancy restaurants to (18:19 - 18:22)
dine in because (18:21 - 18:23)
a lot of them are closed or a lot of (18:22 - 18:25)
them are only limited to man so it makes (18:23 - 18:26)
it really hard to book (18:25 - 18:28)
i'm not going to spas i'm not going rock (18:26 - 18:30)
climbing i'm not going to the gym (18:28 - 18:33)
people have extra money because they (18:30 - 18:35)
can't do anything else with their money (18:33 - 18:38)
so they buy dumb pokemon cards (18:35 - 18:40)
because that's the one thing they can do (18:38 - 18:42)
right now but like again (18:40 - 18:44)
once the pandemic is over am i going to (18:42 - 18:45)
continue spending 200 (18:44 - 18:47)
on pokemon cards or am i going to spend (18:45 - 18:49)
the 200 and take a trip down to (18:47 - 18:51)
uh disneyland that's not disneyland it's (18:49 - 18:52)
not 200 (18:51 - 18:55)
that was a bad example 200 of disney (18:52 - 18:56)
world but (18:55 - 18:58)
the point still stands take 200 to go to (18:56 - 18:59)
the dells (18:58 - 19:01)
there you go that's a nice day this is (18:59 - 19:03)
also (19:01 - 19:05)
not the first time we've ever had (19:03 - 19:07)
pokemon cards at button mcdonald's (19:05 - 19:08)
this is like the 100th time we've had (19:07 - 19:10)
pokemon cards at mcdonald's very true (19:08 - 19:13)
and i will say name a single (19:10 - 19:16)
mcdonald's pokemon card somebody's gonna (19:13 - 19:18)
be like well this japanese mcdonald's (19:16 - 19:20)
no okay yes sure one japanese mcdonald's (19:18 - 19:21)
pokemon card probably worth like 80 (19:20 - 19:22)
bucks (19:21 - 19:25)
but name one english (19:22 - 19:27)
pokemon card at mcdonald's that is worth (19:25 - 19:29)
money today none of them are (19:27 - 19:31)
maybe like six bucks for like some like (19:29 - 19:33)
squirtle or pikachu or whatever (19:31 - 19:35)
none of them are worth money let me (19:33 - 19:37)
bring up the ancient mew card that (19:35 - 19:38)
everyone thought was (19:37 - 19:41)
gonna be worth money it's also worth (19:38 - 19:43)
about six bucks hey how about the uh (19:41 - 19:46)
entei promotion for the third ante movie (19:43 - 19:48)
not worth anything the zapdos small (19:46 - 19:49)
trace articuno for (19:48 - 19:51)
pokemon the movie 2000 the power of us (19:49 - 19:52)
where the bad guy's name is sir lawrence (19:51 - 19:54)
the third no one ever remembers that but (19:52 - 19:54)
those cards (19:54 - 19:56)
i remember that every time they're worth (19:54 - 19:58)
nothing some cards (19:56 - 19:59)
some there there are there are (19:58 - 20:01)
exceptions there are some (19:59 - 20:03)
weird pokemon cards like the delivery (20:01 - 20:05)
pikachu right now from the pokemon (20:03 - 20:06)
center promotion it's like worth 200 (20:05 - 20:07)
bucks (20:06 - 20:10)
there are some cards that break (20:07 - 20:12)
some weird barrier and they're worth (20:10 - 20:14)
something but it does (20:12 - 20:17)
suck although it's not unexpected (20:14 - 20:20)
that scalpers went to mcdonald's (20:17 - 20:23)
they bought 150 packs they bought 100 (20:20 - 20:25)
packs they bought 500 packs and then (20:23 - 20:26)
they immediately put them on ebay (20:25 - 20:29)
i am not going to grill somebody who is (20:26 - 20:30)
25 years old (20:29 - 20:32)
who has been collecting pokemon cards (20:30 - 20:34)
for 10 years that wants to buy like 10 (20:32 - 20:35)
packs from mcdonald's (20:34 - 20:37)
you're fine don't feel bad about it it's (20:35 - 20:39)
they're just cards (20:37 - 20:41)
and guess what if if mcdonald's ran out (20:39 - 20:43)
of happy meal cards (20:41 - 20:45)
they got other happy meals to do like (20:43 - 20:47)
they will never not have happy meals (20:45 - 20:48)
they have old happy meals (20:47 - 20:51)
but that that that i can't imagine that (20:48 - 20:52)
situation (20:51 - 20:56)
is so unique to right now because again (20:52 - 20:58)
not every mcdonald's gets the same (20:56 - 21:00)
supply of toys (20:58 - 21:02)
not every mcdonald's gets the same (21:00 - 21:03)
supply uh (21:02 - 21:05)
not every mcdonald's has the same (21:03 - 21:07)
restrictions there is probably like (21:05 - 21:10)
a mcdonald's that was told hey limit (21:07 - 21:12)
these but they didn't care (21:10 - 21:13)
somebody probably pulled up in the chevy (21:12 - 21:15)
blazer and bought (21:13 - 21:18)
their entire stock and the the franchise (21:15 - 21:19)
owner of that mcdonald's just (21:18 - 21:23)
simply didn't care is that (21:19 - 21:26)
is that the person yes but that's also (21:23 - 21:28)
the dude i mean like that's also the (21:26 - 21:30)
like mcdonald's fault for selling all (21:28 - 21:31)
100 person at the window (21:30 - 21:33)
that i wouldn't blame it on the owner (21:31 - 21:34)
right it's the person at the window who (21:33 - 21:36)
was like oh i didn't realize we weren't (21:34 - 21:37)
supposed to sell (21:36 - 21:40)
all of them all at once but i did want (21:37 - 21:41)
to say two things (21:40 - 21:44)
um for people who might be confused as (21:41 - 21:45)
to like (21:44 - 21:47)
why doesn't mcdonald's just make a roll (21:45 - 21:49)
that says one per customer or something (21:47 - 21:49)
like (21:49 - 21:52)
uh mcdonald's is a real estate company (21:49 - 21:54)
they're not a restaurant company they (21:52 - 21:57)
um sell real estate to franchisees who (21:54 - 21:59)
then are allowed to operate a mcdonald's (21:57 - 22:00)
restaurant on that real estate so (21:59 - 22:02)
they they in general don't make rules (22:00 - 22:04)
about how each individual restaurant (22:02 - 22:05)
runs (22:04 - 22:08)
that's up to the franchisee to determine (22:05 - 22:09)
for their own market (22:08 - 22:11)
the other thing is and greg this is kind (22:09 - 22:13)
of a realization that i've had (22:11 - 22:16)
this i i think the big thing is that (22:13 - 22:17)
this is a (22:16 - 22:20)
a pure like conflagration of of (22:17 - 22:23)
the zoomer world you've got the boomers (22:20 - 22:25)
out there who think that they're going (22:23 - 22:25)
to find (22:25 - 22:27)
like baseball cards in the old days (22:25 - 22:29)
where there's like oh i'm going to find (22:27 - 22:31)
this one super rare baseball card that's (22:29 - 22:32)
going to make me rich (22:31 - 22:34)
like that mentality that they've seeded (22:32 - 22:35)
into the world (22:34 - 22:37)
and then you've got all the millennials (22:35 - 22:39)
out there who are like well i just got (22:37 - 22:41)
to find the next scam to make enough (22:39 - 22:42)
money because (22:41 - 22:44)
i'm not getting paid enough anyways so (22:42 - 22:47)
like all scams are now perfectly legal (22:44 - 22:49)
and it's like we're gen x we're caught (22:47 - 22:50)
in the middle and we're like whatever (22:49 - 22:52)
whatever y'all do what you got to do (22:50 - 22:54)
yeah whatever kids have fun (22:52 - 22:58)
what was the point again none of these (22:54 - 22:59)
cards are actually worth money this is (22:58 - 23:00)
the (22:59 - 23:02)
this is the actual shocking thing so on (23:00 - 23:04)
tuesday when the cards came out (23:02 - 23:07)
the most i saw a pikachu card sell for (23:04 - 23:09)
was eighty dollars (23:07 - 23:11)
all the other cards the chimchar holo (23:09 - 23:13)
pikachu sorry (23:11 - 23:16)
the chimchar the piplup the squirtle the (23:13 - 23:19)
charmander the froakie the most i ever (23:16 - 23:21)
saw any of those sell for were like (23:19 - 23:22)
four dollars i think maybe the (23:21 - 23:25)
charmander was six uh the froakie was (23:22 - 23:27)
like 250 and these are sold auctions (23:25 - 23:29)
and somebody came into my twitch stream (23:27 - 23:31)
and somebody said oh uh (23:29 - 23:33)
somebody on ebay you just can't listen (23:31 - 23:34)
to twitch somebody (23:33 - 23:36)
well i disproved it really easily (23:34 - 23:38)
somebody came in and they were like oh (23:36 - 23:40)
somebody on ebay bought all the hollows (23:38 - 23:41)
the complete collection for nine (23:40 - 23:42)
thousand dollars (23:41 - 23:45)
no they didn't yeah they did look look (23:42 - 23:46)
look the see (23:45 - 23:47)
the auction ended at nine thousand (23:46 - 23:50)
dollars sure the auction ended at nine (23:47 - 23:50)
thousand (23:50 - 23:52)
dollars but why would anyone pay that (23:50 - 23:53)
amount (23:52 - 23:55)
the most a single pikachu went for was (23:53 - 23:57)
eighty dollars (23:55 - 23:58)
if you were if you were even if you were (23:57 - 24:00)
to do eighty dollars (23:58 - 24:03)
by 25 just assume that every single one (24:00 - 24:05)
of these cards was eighty dollars (24:03 - 24:08)
your math is two thousand dollars so why (24:05 - 24:09)
would anyone pay (24:08 - 24:12)
seven thousand extra dollars to get it (24:09 - 24:13)
and they were like (24:12 - 24:15)
but that's what it ended at and i was (24:13 - 24:17)
like okay let me explain ebay to you (24:15 - 24:20)
i'm very familiar with it just like (24:17 - 24:22)
there are some scalpers (24:20 - 24:25)
on ebay there are people on ebay (24:22 - 24:28)
that only bid on things to waste (24:25 - 24:29)
scalpers time (24:28 - 24:32)
so for example if there is a hot (24:29 - 24:33)
commodity on ebay (24:32 - 24:35)
here's a really good example this is (24:33 - 24:37)
actually the only example in this (24:35 - 24:38)
episode that i will probably get right (24:37 - 24:40)
that wasn't a disney reference or a (24:38 - 24:43)
bad car reference is when amoeba and (24:40 - 24:46)
when uh when nintendo amiibos came out (24:43 - 24:46)
they (24:46 - 24:49)
also had the same problem we're talking (24:46 - 24:50)
right now (24:49 - 24:53)
and because people were so frustrated (24:50 - 24:56)
about amiibos being bought out at target (24:53 - 24:57)
every single morning because the (24:56 - 24:59)
scalpers would wait outside target at (24:57 - 25:00)
like 6 a.m (24:59 - 25:02)
buy all the amiibos and then put them on (25:00 - 25:04)
ebay is there was a group of people and (25:02 - 25:06)
this has existed on ebay for a long time (25:04 - 25:09)
and they will bid on the scalpers items (25:06 - 25:10)
and they will drive the prices (25:09 - 25:12)
up and they will win the auction and (25:10 - 25:14)
then they won't pay (25:12 - 25:16)
and their only penalty from ebay is (25:14 - 25:17)
their account gets like (25:16 - 25:19)
banned for like 30 days you know what (25:17 - 25:22)
you do you just make another free ebay (25:19 - 25:23)
account (25:22 - 25:26)
and you do it again and you do that to (25:23 - 25:26)
the same (25:26 - 25:28)
oh it's very easy to find scalpers (25:26 - 25:30)
because they use the same ebay username (25:28 - 25:32)
and you can find all their auctions very (25:30 - 25:34)
easily and then you just bid on all of (25:32 - 25:35)
them (25:34 - 25:37)
and then when it ends in 24 hours or (25:35 - 25:40)
five days or whatever time they set it (25:37 - 25:41)
which is usually like five days right in (25:40 - 25:43)
ebay auctions like five to seven days (25:41 - 25:46)
you win the bid they wasted a week (25:43 - 25:49)
to hope that they get money at the end (25:46 - 25:51)
they don't get the money (25:49 - 25:53)
they then have to argue with ebay about (25:51 - 25:54)
how you didn't pay but you don't care (25:53 - 25:55)
because you're just gonna make another (25:54 - 25:57)
ebay account and then they get (25:55 - 25:58)
ebay goes okay well they didn't pay you (25:57 - 26:01)
get to relist and now they have to wait (25:58 - 26:03)
a whole nother week (26:01 - 26:05)
to sell these items again and you know (26:03 - 26:07)
what happens those people (26:05 - 26:10)
do the same thing and now it's two weeks (26:07 - 26:12)
and a lot can change in two weeks (26:10 - 26:14)
especially for a scalper because they (26:12 - 26:15)
need to sell (26:14 - 26:17)
when those products are hot let me give (26:15 - 26:19)
you another really good example (26:17 - 26:21)
that pikachu card that was 80 on tuesday (26:19 - 26:22)
it was 40 (26:21 - 26:25)
on wednesday because these cars are not (26:22 - 26:27)
worth anything (26:25 - 26:29)
they only worth 80 dollars is because (26:27 - 26:31)
like people are desperate for the (26:29 - 26:32)
pikachu card (26:31 - 26:34)
but the price keeps going down because (26:32 - 26:36)
no one actually cares about like no (26:34 - 26:39)
like that it doesn't matter they're just (26:36 - 26:39)
cards (26:39 - 26:42)
in in six weeks or six months (26:39 - 26:45)
or whenever this event is over like look (26:42 - 26:45)
it up look at (26:45 - 26:48)
look up the black and white unova ones (26:45 - 26:49)
they had a bunch of the same sparkly (26:48 - 26:50)
cards (26:49 - 26:51)
none of them are worth more than five (26:50 - 26:53)
bucks and there's only there's like 10 (26:51 - 26:54)
of them (26:53 - 26:55)
it really says something though because (26:54 - 26:57)
this used to be an issue in vanguard as (26:55 - 26:59)
well because they always used to do (26:57 - 27:02)
the pre-releases one week before the (26:59 - 27:04)
actual set came out (27:02 - 27:06)
and in that week which i used to call (27:04 - 27:08)
golden hype week it was like (27:06 - 27:11)
cards were 10 times on tcg player (27:08 - 27:14)
what after the actual set came out they (27:11 - 27:15)
would actually be (27:14 - 27:17)
but it's just because people like had to (27:15 - 27:18)
have the card (27:17 - 27:21)
before anybody else yes you literally (27:18 - 27:22)
can't wait one week (27:21 - 27:26)
yep yeah yep it's it was just like the (27:22 - 27:28)
um the shiny charizard from champions (27:26 - 27:29)
path (27:28 - 27:31)
when it first came out ungraded (27:29 - 27:32)
charizard from champion (27:31 - 27:34)
champions path was twelve hundred (27:32 - 27:36)
dollars and that was like the week (27:34 - 27:38)
before champions path came out (27:36 - 27:39)
and then champion's path came out and (27:38 - 27:41)
within the like (27:39 - 27:42)
first two weeks of champions path coming (27:41 - 27:45)
out that shiny charizard (27:42 - 27:48)
ungraded was 800 and now (27:45 - 27:50)
i looked it up before the episode (27:48 - 27:53)
because we we spent like i said i spent (27:50 - 27:54)
three hours on ebay the other day (27:53 - 27:55)
looking at these cards (27:54 - 27:58)
now that same charizard from champions (27:55 - 28:00)
path shiny charizard (27:58 - 28:03)
is 360 ungraded now you could you could (28:00 - 28:05)
grade it to get more (28:03 - 28:08)
but people want the newest shiniest (28:05 - 28:09)
thing (28:08 - 28:13)
on day one and then over time (28:09 - 28:15)
people have a less desire to get it and (28:13 - 28:17)
or the scalpers are just (28:15 - 28:19)
not the scalpers in that case you could (28:17 - 28:20)
you could easily just pull that (28:19 - 28:22)
charizard on day one and be like (28:20 - 28:24)
oh well if it's selling for a thousand i (28:22 - 28:25)
don't care that much i'd rather have the (28:24 - 28:27)
thousand dollars i don't blame you (28:25 - 28:29)
if you're one of the first people that (28:27 - 28:31)
pulled the shiny charizard on champions (28:29 - 28:31)
path (28:31 - 28:32)
i would probably just get rid of it and (28:31 - 28:34)
then buy it back like six months later (28:32 - 28:35)
when it's drastically cheaper (28:34 - 28:37)
but again this whole situation is not (28:35 - 28:38)
exclusive to pokemon cards (28:37 - 28:42)
like the digimon card game just launched (28:38 - 28:45)
in america officially again (28:42 - 28:47)
because it launched back in the 90s it's (28:45 - 28:48)
a different one different one different (28:47 - 28:49)
game (28:48 - 28:51)
but it just launched this week and it's (28:49 - 28:53)
completely sold out it's impossible to (28:51 - 28:53)
get (28:53 - 28:54)
the only thing i feel like that isn't (28:53 - 28:56)
sold out nowadays is magic (28:54 - 28:58)
but i'm sure i'm sure people are (28:56 - 29:00)
desperate for cards maybe they'll move (28:58 - 29:01)
to magic next (29:00 - 29:03)
please please no i think it's really (29:01 - 29:05)
wild magic is (29:03 - 29:08)
magic makes very little sense but magic (29:05 - 29:09)
cards (29:08 - 29:11)
in like if you want to get into the (29:09 - 29:12)
craziness of magic you can buy (29:11 - 29:14)
thousand dollar cards if you want i (29:12 - 29:16)
think the moral of this story (29:14 - 29:19)
is scalpers are the worst no matter what (29:16 - 29:20)
they're scalping (29:19 - 29:23)
true true they are trying to manipulate (29:20 - 29:25)
things to make a quick buck (29:23 - 29:28)
for things that aren't aren't worth that (29:25 - 29:30)
quick buck if you really want this (29:28 - 29:32)
pikachu card (29:30 - 29:33)
just wait like right now i'm seeing this (29:32 - 29:36)
one going for forty two dollars (29:33 - 29:39)
with four dollar shipping ends in like (29:36 - 29:40)
two hours (29:39 - 29:42)
i it might go up a little bit but well (29:40 - 29:44)
okay so i will say this to anyone who's (29:42 - 29:45)
under the age of 25 (29:44 - 29:48)
right now there was a point in my life (29:45 - 29:50)
where there were transformers that i (29:48 - 29:52)
really really wanted (29:50 - 29:55)
and i was like it breaks my heart (29:52 - 29:56)
that i can't have this transform i (29:55 - 29:58)
didn't have the money whatever (29:56 - 30:01)
guess what i'm 47 years old i don't even (29:58 - 30:03)
remember which transformer it was (30:01 - 30:06)
the feeling will pass time erases (30:03 - 30:06)
everything (30:06 - 30:10)
exactly yes gratefully thank goodness (30:06 - 30:13)
so out of all of this tcg stuff (30:10 - 30:16)
the pokemon company put out an update on (30:13 - 30:17)
the (30:16 - 30:19)
support.pokemon.com they say we are (30:17 - 30:20)
aware that you are experienced some (30:19 - 30:22)
difficulties purchasing certain pokemon (30:20 - 30:24)
trading card game products due to very (30:22 - 30:25)
high demand and global (30:24 - 30:27)
shipping constraints impacting (30:25 - 30:29)
availability we understand that this (30:27 - 30:30)
inconvenience can be disappointing for (30:29 - 30:32)
fans we are working to address it with (30:30 - 30:35)
where it is within our control in (30:32 - 30:37)
situations where limited availability we (30:35 - 30:39)
are actively working to print more (30:37 - 30:41)
of the impacted tcg products as quickly (30:39 - 30:42)
as possible (30:41 - 30:44)
and at maximum capacity to support the (30:42 - 30:45)
increased demand (30:44 - 30:47)
reprinted products will be available at (30:45 - 30:49)
retailers as soon as possible (30:47 - 30:51)
for the new pokemon tcg expansion (30:49 - 30:53)
expansions launching the future we are (30:51 - 30:54)
maximizing production (30:53 - 30:56)
to increase product availability upon (30:54 - 30:58)
release we will continue to reprint (30:56 - 31:00)
products to replenish stock at retailers (30:58 - 31:01)
as soon as possible (31:00 - 31:02)
we'd like to thank the community for (31:01 - 31:04)
their continued support and patience as (31:02 - 31:06)
we work to deliver more (31:04 - 31:08)
tcg products to fans and this is this is (31:06 - 31:09)
a very common thing (31:08 - 31:12)
right like when like unbroken bonds and (31:09 - 31:13)
unified mines came out (31:12 - 31:16)
those did eventually sell out after like (31:13 - 31:18)
six months of being released (31:16 - 31:19)
and they were kind of hard to find (31:18 - 31:22)
although if you walk into (31:19 - 31:24)
before this before all these cards sold (31:22 - 31:25)
out which (31:24 - 31:27)
was around christmas time uh you could (31:25 - 31:29)
still find like crimson invasion (31:27 - 31:31)
you could still find fates collide you (31:29 - 31:32)
could still find uh (31:31 - 31:35)
xy evolutions because they made too many (31:32 - 31:36)
of those sets (31:35 - 31:37)
because they thought they were gonna (31:36 - 31:39)
sell well and they didn't but then they (31:37 - 31:40)
made too few (31:39 - 31:42)
like unified mines which did actually (31:40 - 31:44)
sell well so now i (31:42 - 31:46)
i expect what the problem is going to be (31:44 - 31:48)
there's going to be a point in like the (31:46 - 31:49)
next 10 months (31:48 - 31:51)
where the only thing on shelves is going (31:49 - 31:52)
to be like (31:51 - 31:54)
vivid voltage and darkness ablaze (31:52 - 31:56)
because they're going to like reprint (31:54 - 31:57)
them all right (31:56 - 32:00)
no vivid voltage is a good set right now (31:57 - 32:01)
i don't know if it's gonna be a good set (32:00 - 32:01)
in 10 months (32:01 - 32:03)
they're gonna probably reprint like a (32:01 - 32:05)
bunch of darkness ablaze and vivid (32:03 - 32:06)
voltage and (32:05 - 32:07)
probably battle styles battle styles is (32:06 - 32:08)
probably gonna be the new crimson (32:07 - 32:09)
invasion (32:08 - 32:11)
uh which is to say like yeah i think (32:09 - 32:13)
battle sales is gonna sell real well (32:11 - 32:15)
yeah uh but like crimson invasion was (32:13 - 32:17)
like the worst set ever it was a bad set (32:15 - 32:18)
when it came out (32:17 - 32:20)
like there was there was no reason to (32:18 - 32:22)
get it unless like you wanted (32:20 - 32:24)
like the main card from that set was (32:22 - 32:26)
like a buzzwell and like b standard (32:24 - 32:30)
b b string and neither like b string i (32:26 - 32:31)
think was uncommon and buzzwell was like (32:30 - 32:33)
rare but it was like a four dollar rare (32:31 - 32:35)
but i don't particularly think there's (32:33 - 32:36)
like (32:35 - 32:38)
and the problem with like not the (32:36 - 32:39)
problem but the (32:38 - 32:43)
the the timing of darkness ablaze (32:39 - 32:44)
which had a charizard in it and (32:43 - 32:47)
champion's path which had two charizards (32:44 - 32:47)
in it (32:47 - 32:51)
and vivid voltage which had fat pikachu (32:47 - 32:51)
in it (32:51 - 32:55)
those are all my grandma knows those (32:51 - 32:57)
pokemon (32:55 - 32:59)
like everyone knows those pokemon the (32:57 - 33:02)
chase card the sought after card in (32:59 - 33:06)
in battle styles is hershey foo (33:02 - 33:09)
and nursing food very new so i don't (33:06 - 33:12)
know if that's going to be there's no (33:09 - 33:13)
charizard in that set there's no pikachu (33:12 - 33:15)
in that set like (33:13 - 33:18)
i don't know if not having gen (33:15 - 33:20)
one nostalgia i get it there's somebody (33:18 - 33:23)
i hate that gen 1 nostalgia yeah (33:20 - 33:25)
okay but guess what it sells case in (33:23 - 33:27)
point yeah it certainly does (33:25 - 33:28)
but i don't think battle styles has (33:27 - 33:32)
anything like very shiny that is just (33:28 - 33:35)
as recognizable as a fat pikachu on a (33:32 - 33:36)
card like it's (33:35 - 33:38)
say what you will about pikachu it's a (33:36 - 33:39)
very recognizable pokemon (33:38 - 33:42)
uh and i love irshifu i think hershey (33:39 - 33:43)
food's cool he's a cool dude (33:42 - 33:46)
wait a minute which one uh both hershey (33:43 - 33:47)
foods are in the set (33:46 - 33:49)
no no no which one do you think is a (33:47 - 33:51)
cool dude because they can't both be (33:49 - 33:55)
oh the water oh the water (33:51 - 33:58)
yeah water fighting water has never been (33:55 - 34:00)
cool dude (33:58 - 34:03)
water fighting is just poli-wrap (34:00 - 34:06)
you're not wrong that's the tcg talk (34:03 - 34:08)
there's a lot let's take a break (34:06 - 34:11)
uh and then let's argue some more about (34:08 - 34:12)
the kanto (34:11 - 34:21)
fest celebration okay (34:12 - 34:24)
[Music] (34:21 - 34:36)
i just woke up it's 3 p.m (34:24 - 34:36)
[Music] (34:37 - 34:49)
it's okay it's cool (34:44 - 35:07)
[Music] (34:49 - 35:07)
we are back uh before we get to the (35:11 - 35:16)
pokemon go stuff there is a shiny (35:14 - 35:18)
toxicity (35:16 - 35:22)
being given out using pokemon pass (35:18 - 35:26)
at gamestop that's it (35:22 - 35:29)
that's a thing again i think this is (35:26 - 35:32)
probably planned six months ago hoping (35:29 - 35:34)
the pandemic maybe would be over (35:32 - 35:37)
yeah is there something (35:34 - 35:39)
why i just don't understand why it's (35:37 - 35:41)
pokemon i do understand why it's pokemon (35:39 - 35:42)
pass (35:41 - 35:44)
because they have to scan the qr code (35:42 - 35:46)
and you have to be within the vicinity (35:44 - 35:48)
of the location it uses your gps right (35:46 - 35:51)
you can't scan the qr code at home you (35:48 - 35:53)
have to go to the game stop or (35:51 - 35:55)
go at least outside the game stop so you (35:53 - 35:56)
can do it from your car (35:55 - 35:59)
so this is your this is your coved (35:56 - 36:05)
solution and give you the hot tip here (35:59 - 36:05)
you go with a friend or your significant (36:07 - 36:11)
other (36:10 - 36:13)
or your family what a perfect (36:11 - 36:14)
valentine's date (36:13 - 36:15)
well no because you can't do this until (36:14 - 36:17)
the 19th oh all right (36:15 - 36:20)
take that back you have them you have (36:17 - 36:21)
your (36:20 - 36:24)
significant other friend etc pull up the (36:21 - 36:25)
qr code (36:24 - 36:27)
on their phone while you're in the (36:25 - 36:29)
parking lot of gamestop in your car safe (36:27 - 36:30)
and sound (36:29 - 36:32)
you use your phone you scan their phone (36:30 - 36:34)
for the qr code and then you switch (36:32 - 36:37)
you pull up the qr code so you can't (36:34 - 36:39)
you can't do this without another person (36:37 - 36:40)
there might be (36:39 - 36:43)
actually you know there was a point i (36:40 - 36:44)
want to say it was the target one (36:43 - 36:46)
because i couldn't find the qr code (36:44 - 36:48)
and i think if you like there was a (36:46 - 36:50)
button in the app (36:48 - 36:52)
yeah there was a there was there's (36:50 - 36:53)
always been like if you can't find the (36:52 - 36:55)
code somewhere in the store because they (36:53 - 36:57)
probably didn't put it up (36:55 - 37:00)
uh hit this button yeah i i thought the (36:57 - 37:02)
target ones you had to be like on the (37:00 - 37:04)
target wi-fi (37:02 - 37:06)
or something i think so i just remember (37:04 - 37:09)

did not have it (37:09 - 37:12)
they didn't have it at all that sounds (37:10 - 37:13)
about right (37:12 - 37:16)
but i don't i i i have for all of these (37:13 - 37:18)

clearing out all the pokemon pass (38:05 - 38:08)
agreements before they switch over (38:07 - 38:11)

true they could have done like a five (38:11 - 38:15)
we're we're doing five distributions (38:14 - 38:17)
with gamestop we haven't hit our quota (38:15 - 38:18)

i'm curious and we'll have to put this (38:21 - 38:24)
on the list of things to (38:23 - 38:28)

and i'm like (38:58 - 39:02)
am i going to pay another 16 for nothing (38:59 - 39:04)
and the answer was yes because i decided (39:02 - 39:06)
i guess i'm paying 16 (39:04 - 39:08)
for nothing because i really didn't want (39:06 - 39:09)
to try to go through the pain of (39:08 - 39:10)
figuring out (39:09 - 39:13)
where i wanted to put things how many (39:10 - 39:15)
pokemon do you have at home (39:13 - 39:17)

then i'll just fire it up and (39:28 - 39:32)

used by your pokemon boxes in the (41:25 - 41:29)
nintendo switch (41:27 - 41:32)
version of pokemon home greg (41:29 - 41:34)
they listened to you it it only took a (41:32 - 41:36)
year it took a full year (41:34 - 41:38)
thanks pokemon home for doing the thing (41:36 - 41:40)
you should have done they really wanted (41:38 - 41:41)
your 16 (41:40 - 41:44)
again they did this is ultimately my (41:41 - 41:46)
decision to (41:44 - 41:47)
knowing that they'll listen to me once a (41:46 - 41:49)
year i said yeah i'll give you 16 bucks (41:47 - 41:52)
yeah it's it's only common courtesy (41:49 - 41:54)
it is you know what they didn't update (41:52 - 41:56)
the switch version you know what i still (41:54 - 41:58)
can't see on the switch version (41:56 - 42:00)
my ribbons and my marks i don't (41:58 - 42:01)
understand (42:00 - 42:04)
i just don't it's it's been a year of (42:01 - 42:05)
pokemon home (42:04 - 42:06)
i've used it coming it's coming i've (42:05 - 42:08)
used i'm sure maybe it is maybe (42:06 - 42:12)
in like two more years it is so hard (42:08 - 42:15)
to recommend the 16 product (42:12 - 42:19)
when it's so bad and it's not even like (42:15 - 42:23)
bad bad it's just inconveniently bad (42:19 - 42:26)
yes yeah the best kind of bad yeah it (42:23 - 42:27)
works (42:26 - 42:30)
it does what it's advertised to do (42:27 - 42:32)
no one is debating that it accepts your (42:30 - 42:33)
pokemon (42:32 - 42:36)
it organizes your pokemon you can put (42:33 - 42:36)
them into (42:36 - 42:39)
specific boxes you can search for them (42:36 - 42:41)
you can mass transfer it like (42:39 - 42:43)
like does what it's advertised to do but (42:41 - 42:44)
how (42:43 - 42:48)
is there one person like all it takes is (42:44 - 42:48)
one person (42:48 - 42:52)
who works at game freak who was like why (42:48 - 42:54)
when we switched to pokemon home are all (42:52 - 42:55)
the buttons flipped around (42:54 - 42:59)
why is the like eleanor (42:55 - 42:59)
you're the only one who cares about the (42:59 - 43:03)
buttons because you don't pay attention (43:01 - 43:04)
to what's going on on the screen (43:03 - 43:08)
no it's so jarring it is i have never (43:04 - 43:08)
been jarred (43:08 - 43:13)
not once i know you are (43:08 - 43:15)
but here's the thing since they listened (43:13 - 43:17)
to me this year next year to get the 16 (43:15 - 43:19)
bucks they will listen to you and make (43:17 - 43:22)
that one change so i have to (43:19 - 43:24)
single delete my so i do a lot of mark (43:22 - 43:26)
hunting i think this is very well known (43:24 - 43:28)
i like to catch every pokemon i see i (43:26 - 43:30)
like to see if it has a mark (43:28 - 43:32)
and if it doesn't have a mark i throw it (43:30 - 43:33)
away if it does have a mark (43:32 - 43:35)
i put it in a box where it lives for (43:33 - 43:36)
about two months and then (43:35 - 43:38)
two months later i go ah dang it i got (43:36 - 43:40)
two of these too many of these marks now (43:38 - 43:41)
i gotta throw some away because (43:40 - 43:44)
i got dupl i got a lot of sleepy marks (43:41 - 43:44)
over here (43:44 - 43:47)
uh this is the life i live it's terrible (43:44 - 43:49)
how do you afford all these pokeballs (43:47 - 43:53)
uh black market yep (43:49 - 43:55)
the actual travesty is the amount of (43:53 - 43:58)
people who are watching my stream going (43:55 - 44:00)
steve why don't you move them to pokemon (43:58 - 44:02)
home so you can mass transfer them (44:00 - 44:04)
i can't do that do you know why because (44:02 - 44:05)
i can't see (44:04 - 44:07)
marks in pokemon home i can't see (44:05 - 44:08)
ribbons i can't see (44:07 - 44:10)
anything it's like this feature that has (44:08 - 44:12)
existed since i don't know (44:10 - 44:14)
gen 3 and it doesn't work in the switch (44:12 - 44:16)
version of the app (44:14 - 44:19)
i don't understand the sad thing is (44:16 - 44:19)
because (44:19 - 44:21)
you're the only person that actually (44:19 - 44:22)
cares about this stuff but (44:21 - 44:26)
transfer it to pokemon home then pull up (44:22 - 44:27)
your phone (44:26 - 44:29)
pull it up on your phone because you're (44:27 - 44:32)
already playing the other game (44:29 - 44:34)
on your switch so you don't have to (44:32 - 44:35)
leave (44:34 - 44:37)
sword and shield you just have it on (44:35 - 44:38)
your phone easy (44:37 - 44:40)
situation solved i'm i'm a problem (44:38 - 44:42)
solver you just need to go (44:40 - 44:45)
i agree i am glad that pokemon home got (44:42 - 44:46)
an update (44:45 - 44:48)
it is uh hopefully there are more (44:46 - 44:50)
updates i would assume (44:48 - 44:52)
i would hope i guess we're getting the p (44:50 - 44:53)
oh gosh (44:52 - 44:55)
we gotta talk about the pikachu man this (44:53 - 44:57)
news is going right into this news (44:55 - 45:00)
announced a pikachu with the exclusive (44:57 - 45:01)
move (45:00 - 45:06)
sing so this is off uh 25. (45:01 - 45:09)
it is a uh it's a you need a password (45:06 - 45:10)
through mystery gift pikachu will know (45:09 - 45:11)
the move sing (45:10 - 45:13)
it'll be in a cherish ball ot will be (45:11 - 45:15)
game freak (45:13 - 45:17)
uh it will have the souvenir ribbon it (45:15 - 45:19)
will know sing encore celebrate electro (45:17 - 45:20)
ball (45:19 - 45:22)
on the website it says come back on (45:20 - 45:24)
february 25th for a password you can use (45:22 - 45:26)
to add this pokemon to your team (45:24 - 45:27)
i was going to say is this another email (45:26 - 45:29)
thing so (45:27 - 45:31)
some places say it's coming in email and (45:29 - 45:33)
on the website so it might be (45:31 - 45:35)
both i'm hoping they're doing both (45:33 - 45:37)
because the fiasco was the last password (45:35 - 45:41)
so i'm hoping it is one universal (45:37 - 45:44)
just putting on here and being done with (45:41 - 45:45)
it because that's the way it should have (45:44 - 45:46)
happened for everything (45:45 - 45:49)
because there are still millions of (45:46 - 45:51)
starving children who never got the (45:49 - 45:52)
zeroed code (45:51 - 45:53)
yeah you guys all complaining about (45:52 - 45:55)
mcdonald's cards what happened to those (45:53 - 45:56)
poor kids that (45:55 - 45:58)
signed up with their parents email to (45:56 - 46:00)
get us over (45:58 - 46:02)
i'm probably the last person to get as a (46:00 - 46:03)
rude and thanks to (46:02 - 46:06)
tomahawk is the only name that i have (46:03 - 46:09)
for them (46:06 - 46:11)
yes or extra is a rude code but i would (46:09 - 46:13)
i would assume that we would get a (46:11 - 46:14)
pokemon like (46:13 - 46:16)
don't they want to reward the people (46:14 - 46:17)
paying 16 a month with a (46:16 - 46:20)
pokemon i guess you don't have to pay (46:17 - 46:22)
16. you just have to have the app free (46:20 - 46:25)
yeah is sing pikachu the new meta (46:22 - 46:29)
i hope so i think so you gigantomax it (46:25 - 46:33)
yeah you sing 55 accuracy (46:29 - 46:34)
we'll never see it coming but what does (46:33 - 46:36)
it turn into does it just turn into (46:34 - 46:37)
shield (46:36 - 46:39)
yeah sing would be max guard what does (46:37 - 46:40)
what does sing do (46:39 - 46:42)
does it cause damage no it puts them no (46:40 - 46:43)
question to sleep (46:42 - 46:44)
[Music] (46:43 - 46:47)
with not a good rate (46:44 - 46:49)
yeah it's 50 yeah the spore is a hundred (46:47 - 46:51)
sleep powder i think is (46:49 - 46:54)
60 75 75 70 i think so (46:51 - 46:56)
and then sing is sing is the worst of (46:54 - 46:58)
the sleeping moves it is (46:56 - 47:00)
the only thing that sing is no because i (46:58 - 47:02)
was going to say sing is good on (47:00 - 47:03)
milotic but i think mild to learn (47:02 - 47:06)
hypnosis but like (47:03 - 47:07)
milotic also learns coil and coil (47:06 - 47:09)
increases your like defense and your (47:07 - 47:10)
accuracy i think so that's why (47:09 - 47:12)
like yeah milotic runs hypnosis because (47:10 - 47:14)
the accuracy boost of coil (47:12 - 47:17)
yeah sleep powder is 75 i knew that (47:14 - 47:18)
because i use it (47:17 - 47:21)
on rosalia all the time (47:18 - 47:24)
sing is 55 it's bad (47:21 - 47:27)

sounds about right yeah yeah (49:02 - 49:05)
so at the time they were like hey (49:04 - 49:07)
there's going to be a canto tour it'll (49:05 - 49:08)
be 12 (49:07 - 49:10)
shiny mew you get to pick between red (49:08 - 49:13)
and green more details will come later (49:10 - 49:14)
i don't even think you could buy the (49:13 - 49:15)
ticket right away i think you buy the (49:14 - 49:17)
ticket like two months later (49:15 - 49:19)
yeah not two months sorry two weeks yeah (49:17 - 49:21)
february (49:19 - 49:23)
8th is when they announced pretty much (49:21 - 49:25)
all the details (49:23 - 49:29)
yes february 9th sorry so about (49:25 - 49:31)
a week ago they announced what is called (49:29 - 49:32)
the (49:31 - 49:34)
master work research which is the mu (49:32 - 49:35)
stuff (49:34 - 49:38)
so prior to this i'm bringing up my (49:35 - 49:39)
twitch stream a lot but it's a real good (49:38 - 49:42)
feel of how many people were confused (49:39 - 49:44)
about this i think (49:42 - 49:46)
at least for me leading up to this event (49:44 - 49:47)
there was a lot of people (49:46 - 49:49)
that would be that would say like (49:47 - 49:51)
something along the lines of i don't (49:49 - 49:53)
know if i want to spend 12.99 (49:51 - 49:56)
and not get the shiny mew right totally (49:53 - 49:57)
understandable (49:56 - 49:59)
that's a that is a real concern yes and (49:57 - 50:01)
when i talked to niantic (49:59 - 50:03)
they said the following we can't talk (50:01 - 50:05)
about the details of the event just yet (50:03 - 50:07)
but just to let you know if you spend (50:05 - 50:09)
the 12.99 you will get the mew (50:07 - 50:10)
eventually (50:09 - 50:12)
like you can't not see like you could (50:10 - 50:13)
spend the 12 90. (50:12 - 50:17)
you could you could pull a will buy (50:13 - 50:19)
the pokemon go fest ticket and then just (50:17 - 50:21)
never log in to accept the quest (50:19 - 50:24)
and not get the victory i was busy that (50:21 - 50:25)
day (50:24 - 50:28)
i had things going on you were at a (50:25 - 50:29)
wedding (50:28 - 50:32)
i was in the wedding yes it was a busy (50:29 - 50:33)
day (50:32 - 50:35)
but i assured people if you if you spent (50:33 - 50:36)
the 12.99 (50:35 - 50:38)
you would definitely get the mew don't (50:36 - 50:39)
know how hard it would be (50:38 - 50:42)
but from niantic's wording the mew quest (50:39 - 50:44)
was supposed to be something that you (50:42 - 50:45)
wouldn't be able to complete the day of (50:44 - 50:46)
anyways (50:45 - 50:48)
it was going to be a long i'm almost (50:46 - 50:50)
positive and i (50:48 - 50:52)
don't have the article in front of me (50:50 - 50:53)
but it was supposed to be a long and (50:52 - 50:55)
difficult thing to complete (50:53 - 50:57)
it is a shiny view after all so on (50:55 - 51:00)
february 9th they announced the details (50:57 - 51:01)
of the masterwork (51:00 - 51:02)
quest they also announced how they were (51:01 - 51:05)
going to handle ditto which was a huge (51:02 - 51:09)
asterisk because people were like (51:05 - 51:11)
how am i supposed to find shiny ditto (51:09 - 51:13)
shiny ditto is the (51:11 - 51:16)
final reward for the saturday event (51:13 - 51:19)
ah so as once you complete the kanto (51:16 - 51:22)
fest shiny ditto will be the thing you (51:19 - 51:23)
end with (51:22 - 51:24)
so you're getting a shiny ditto (51:23 - 51:26)
guaranteed for 12.99 (51:24 - 51:27)
and you're getting a shiny mew (51:26 - 51:29)
guaranteed for 12.99 the only difference (51:27 - 51:31)
is you got to work for the mew (51:29 - 51:33)
the event schedule is it's ten hours it (51:31 - 51:35)
starts at nine o'clock in the morning (51:33 - 51:37)
ends at nine o'clock (51:35 - 51:38)
uh we'll just go through the schedule (51:37 - 51:39)
here we'll get to how to get the mew in (51:38 - 51:40)

palette three to four (52:02 - 52:05)
can you just say pewter once please no (52:06 - 52:09)

the very end (52:18 - 52:23)

that's when you go cram it all in from (52:23 - 52:27)
seven to nine (52:26 - 52:30)
no there's no cramer in this event thank (52:27 - 52:30)
heavens (52:30 - 52:34)
so if you have a non-ticket experience (52:30 - 52:36)
you will get some of the pokemon (52:34 - 52:37)
discovered in the kanto region (52:36 - 52:40)
in wild and raids you will still be able (52:37 - 52:42)

time were not announced (53:11 - 53:15)
but they ended up being result what was (53:12 - 53:15)
the (53:15 - 53:17)
roselli was from february what the heck (53:15 - 53:19)

my chop oh man chump manchester no (53:19 - 53:24)
that's our intellectual property don't (53:22 - 53:25)
confuse that with the pokemon's (53:24 - 53:28)
intellectual property (53:25 - 53:30)
greg and i certainly got a lot of shiny (53:28 - 53:31)
roselias (53:30 - 53:34)
we did some of us got more shiny (53:31 - 53:35)
roselias than (53:34 - 53:39)
other people whatever will (53:35 - 53:41)
i have secret back channels that are (53:39 - 53:44)
going to start feeding me (53:41 - 53:46)
shiny rosalia's left and right i have (53:44 - 53:48)
made deals (53:46 - 53:51)
across the globe to funnel your poor (53:48 - 53:53)
unwanted children (53:51 - 53:56)
to my caring arm the the (53:53 - 53:58)
benefit of the true benefit of the day (53:56 - 54:00)
was i actually saw two other human (53:58 - 54:01)
beings (54:00 - 54:04)
in person yeah which i haven't done in (54:01 - 54:05)
such a long time (54:04 - 54:07)
that was the highlight of the day truly (54:05 - 54:09)
because it was cold (54:07 - 54:11)
okay so the the masterwork research can (54:09 - 54:12)
be completed (54:11 - 54:16)
whenever you unlock it somewhere during (54:12 - 54:16)
the (54:16 - 54:20)
the saturday it contains tasks (54:16 - 54:22)
that uh for getting the canto platinum (54:20 - 54:24)
medal you have to catch 30 pokemon of (54:22 - 54:25)
every single type (54:24 - 54:29)
how many types are there 18 yeah (54:25 - 54:31)
something like that so 18 times 30 how (54:29 - 54:33)
many pokemon is that too many too many (54:31 - 54:36)
uh that's like 500 pokemon uh (54:33 - 54:40)
wait 18. 540. yeah you have to spin 151 (54:36 - 54:42)
unique pokestops (54:40 - 54:43)
all right i have to talk about that you (54:42 - 54:45)
have to what walk (54:43 - 54:49)
151 kilometers which i believe is (54:45 - 54:51)
91 miles i think (54:49 - 54:53)
and then you have to reach level 40. (54:51 - 54:55)
this is the big one (54:53 - 54:57)
that some people are upset about okay so (54:55 - 54:58)
before (54:57 - 55:01)
so the 151 look again we talk about this (54:58 - 55:03)
all the time pokemon go is not a fair (55:01 - 55:04)
game (55:03 - 55:08)
if you live in oconomowoc wisconsin (55:04 - 55:10)
you you might have like 10 pokestops (55:08 - 55:12)
that's not 151. (55:10 - 55:14)
it is cold it is negative one in (55:12 - 55:16)
wisconsin right now (55:14 - 55:18)
very hard to go outside unlike if you (55:16 - 55:19)
lived in california or (55:18 - 55:20)
florida right now it's probably 70 it's (55:19 - 55:21)
probably beautiful out you could (55:20 - 55:22)
probably safely (55:21 - 55:24)
social distance at a park and have a (55:22 - 55:26)
great time uh well maybe not california (55:24 - 55:27)
because (55:26 - 55:31)
california uh but it is it is not fair (55:27 - 55:34)
in the sense of pokemon go is better in (55:31 - 55:37)
big cities if i lived in boston and i (55:34 - 55:39)
was downtown in boston (55:37 - 55:41)
i probably hit 151 stops in in a whole (55:39 - 55:42)
day (55:41 - 55:45)
because literally every single brick in (55:42 - 55:46)
that city is a pokestop (55:45 - 55:48)
they're like this brick has three words (55:46 - 55:50)
written on it we can't read it because (55:48 - 55:52)
it's a hundred years old (55:50 - 55:54)
but it is now a pokestop that is boston (55:52 - 55:55)
in a nutshell (55:54 - 55:58)
i think there are probably 151 pokestops (55:55 - 55:59)
in milwaukee (55:58 - 56:01)
pretty easily but it would require me to (55:59 - 56:02)
drive a lot (56:01 - 56:05)
and it's cold i'll do it i'll do it in (56:02 - 56:08)
like three months (56:05 - 56:09)
oh you'll get it done before three (56:08 - 56:12)
months are up so the level 40. (56:09 - 56:15)
level 40 is not easy to get to (56:12 - 56:17)
this game has been out for over five (56:15 - 56:19)
years there are a lot of people that are (56:17 - 56:20)
not level 40. (56:19 - 56:22)
uh but in order to get the shiny mu you (56:20 - 56:25)
need the 151 stops catch 30 of each type (56:22 - 56:26)
which (56:25 - 56:27)
again that's going to be also hard if (56:26 - 56:28)
there's not a dragon type event (56:27 - 56:29)
happening (56:28 - 56:31)
unless i don't know you live in some (56:29 - 56:32)
dragon biome and you're seeing dratini's (56:31 - 56:34)
nonstop i don't i see like one dragon a (56:32 - 56:34)
week (56:34 - 56:36)
you have to walk 151 kilometers i don't (56:34 - 56:38)
know will you walk a lot what is (56:36 - 56:40)
how about how much you walk in a day i (56:38 - 56:42)
mean for me that's about two weeks i i (56:40 - 56:43)
usually get (56:42 - 56:46)
about 70 kilometers uh (56:43 - 56:48)
for like the what is it adventure sink i (56:46 - 56:50)
usually get about 70 to 75 kilometers a (56:48 - 56:51)
week (56:50 - 56:54)
so two weeks for you for that yeah i've (56:51 - 56:56)
only walked around my house so (56:54 - 56:58)
it'll be four years yeah it'll be long (56:56 - 56:59)
for me (56:58 - 57:02)
until things get warm again and i can (56:59 - 57:02)
walk (57:02 - 57:06)
my neighborhood or return to the skyways (57:02 - 57:08)
to walk around them yeah it's gonna take (57:06 - 57:09)
me a very long time (57:08 - 57:11)
so reaching level 40. so we had we had a (57:09 - 57:12)
viewer that came in twitch chat (57:11 - 57:14)
and they they said that they were they (57:12 - 57:16)
were upset that their significant other (57:14 - 57:19)
was like level 32 they bought the (57:16 - 57:21)
kanto fest tickets back in january it's (57:19 - 57:23)
your mistake starting out dating (57:21 - 57:25)
somebody who's not at least level 37. (57:23 - 57:27)
now come on put that on your match.com (57:25 - 57:29)
profile (57:27 - 57:30)
and that their significant other was (57:29 - 57:31)
bummed and frustrated that they had to (57:30 - 57:32)
be level 40. (57:31 - 57:34)
you know after four years of the game (57:32 - 57:35)
they're only level 32. (57:34 - 57:39)
and my response was well (57:35 - 57:40)
why'd you buy the ticket if you didn't (57:39 - 57:42)
know what the details were (57:40 - 57:43)
and their response was well they should (57:42 - 57:46)
have told us early and my response was (57:43 - 57:49)
well they did the event is uh (57:46 - 57:51)
they told us on the 9th the event is on (57:49 - 57:53)
the 20th so they gave you 11 days (57:51 - 57:55)
a heads up but yes if you bought the (57:53 - 57:57)
ticket in january (57:55 - 58:00)
you had no clue what it was supposed to (57:57 - 58:02)
be we had no clue how to get the mew (58:00 - 58:05)
yep and then i have this one i mean wait (58:02 - 58:05)
let me (58:05 - 58:07)
broken record for one second and say the (58:05 - 58:09)
same thing that i say every single time (58:07 - 58:10)
we hear one of these complaints you (58:09 - 58:12)
bought the ticket for the experience of (58:10 - 58:15)
the kanto day you did not buy the ticket (58:12 - 58:17)
for the shiny mew or the shiny ditto (58:15 - 58:20)
sorry it's the experience i will put an (58:17 - 58:22)
asterisk because they did say back on (58:20 - 58:23)
the 9th that (58:22 - 58:25)
you'll have special read research and (58:23 - 58:27)
then after completing that you'll get (58:25 - 58:30)
another quest line that will go to mu so (58:27 - 58:32)
we knew there was going to be two things (58:30 - 58:35)
yes we knew that we espresso research we (58:32 - 58:37)
knew that the first thing wasn't going (58:35 - 58:38)
to be like (58:37 - 58:40)
the the big concern of this was people (58:38 - 58:41)
were like i don't know if i can catch (58:40 - 58:43)
all 150 pokemon in a day and now i'm not (58:41 - 58:45)
going to get the mew (58:43 - 58:47)
it's clear that that's not it right (58:45 - 58:48)
collecting all 151 pokemon (58:47 - 58:50)
is going to be the like bragging rights (58:48 - 58:52)
or whatever right like it's not (58:50 - 58:54)
the thing you actually have to do um (58:52 - 58:56)
also (58:54 - 58:58)
if you don't definitely hit eight days (58:56 - 59:00)
because they're knocking them around (58:58 - 59:03)
they okay so here's the big thing that (59:00 - 59:03)
they like (59:03 - 59:05)
didn't actually say but if you go to (59:03 - 59:07)
support.niantic.com (59:05 - 59:10)
you do have to complete the pokemon go (59:07 - 59:12)
canto tour special research to get the (59:10 - 59:13)
masterwork research (59:12 - 59:16)
you do not have to finish it that day (59:13 - 59:17)
you can finish it at (59:16 - 59:19)
any point in time to unlock the (59:17 - 59:21)
masterwork research (59:19 - 59:23)
so even if you started the kanto (59:21 - 59:24)
research and then like (59:23 - 59:26)
six months later you finished it you (59:24 - 59:28)
then unlocked the masterwork research (59:26 - 59:30)
so this is what i was saying all along (59:28 - 59:33)
you're not not going to get the shiny mu (59:30 - 59:36)
you just have to do step one before step (59:33 - 59:36)
two (59:36 - 59:39)
now that being said it's just like the (59:36 - 59:41)
celebi research as in like (59:39 - 59:44)
you need to defeat team rocket to finish (59:41 - 59:46)
the celebrity research if team rocket is (59:44 - 59:47)
not spawning (59:46 - 59:49)
you can't do it but that doesn't mean (59:47 - 59:50)
you cannot get the (59:49 - 59:52)
celebi you just have to wait till team (59:50 - 59:54)
rocket comes back (59:52 - 59:56)
so if you don't finish the kanto special (59:54 - 59:58)
research on saturday (59:56 - 60:01)
they're giving you a kanto week after (59:58 - 60:02)
the event and if you don't finish it (60:01 - 60:03)
then (60:02 - 60:07)
you still can finish it later (60:03 - 60:08)
it's just going to be harder because (60:07 - 60:10)
it's probably going to rely on cantos (60:08 - 60:13)
spawns which are not guaranteed (60:10 - 60:15)
all the time this goes back to the (60:13 - 60:16)
original statement (60:15 - 60:17)
if you are worried about spending 12 (60:16 - 60:19)
dollars and not getting shiny mew (60:17 - 60:22)
you will get it you just have to (60:19 - 60:25)
you just have the best the the fastest (60:22 - 60:26)
path to complete it (60:25 - 60:30)
on saturday and a semi okay path to (60:26 - 60:32)
complete it the week after (60:30 - 60:34)
and a well it's going to live forever in (60:32 - 60:35)
your (60:34 - 60:38)
special research category if you don't (60:35 - 60:39)
finish it after that (60:38 - 60:41)
but you're not going to spend 12 and (60:39 - 60:42)
then they're gonna lock you out (60:41 - 60:45)
you're going to get the mew eventually (60:42 - 60:47)
and and i want to throw two things into (60:45 - 60:48)
the mix here number one (60:47 - 60:52)
greg and i are probably like the (60:48 - 60:55)
least amount of effort yeah put towards (60:52 - 60:55)
playing (60:55 - 60:58)
pokemon go that you can honestly put (60:55 - 61:01)
towards it and say i'm an active player (60:58 - 61:03)
and we've both made it to level 40. i've (61:01 - 61:04)
been level 40 for (61:03 - 61:06)
what two years now two and a half years (61:04 - 61:08)
and i honestly (61:06 - 61:09)
the majority of my pokemon go playing (61:08 - 61:11)
time is in the morning (61:09 - 61:13)
sending gifts to people because i enjoy (61:11 - 61:14)
letting people know that i'm thinking (61:13 - 61:15)
about them (61:14 - 61:17)
and i do for every single person that (61:15 - 61:19)
gets a gift from me in pokemon go (61:17 - 61:21)
i think about you a little bit as i send (61:19 - 61:23)
that gift so keep that in mind number (61:21 - 61:23)
one (61:23 - 61:26)
i think about you in as much as i know (61:23 - 61:28)
what your username is (61:26 - 61:30)
no no no no no no sometimes i look at (61:28 - 61:32)
the username and ago (61:30 - 61:35)
i i don't remember who you are i i think (61:32 - 61:37)
like oh you know i i wonder what cool (61:35 - 61:38)
thing you're doing (61:37 - 61:40)
in japan right now oh yeah i don't know (61:38 - 61:41)
here but if i do know who you are then i (61:40 - 61:43)
think like usually like a special (61:41 - 61:46)
memory like uh ryan in (61:43 - 61:48)
england has a new daughter and i think (61:46 - 61:50)
about she's so wonderful (61:48 - 61:51)
and i think about her and then there you (61:50 - 61:54)
go number two (61:51 - 61:58)
shiny mew is about the rarest (61:54 - 62:03)
of the rare pokemon that for for all the (61:58 - 62:06)
the shiny had they've made shiny getting (62:03 - 62:06)
shiny (62:06 - 62:08)
so easy for every other pokemon out (62:06 - 62:10)
there shiny mew is the rarest of the (62:08 - 62:11)
rare (62:10 - 62:13)
pokemon i want to work for it i want to (62:11 - 62:14)
earn it yeah (62:13 - 62:16)
i want this to be an actual challenge so (62:14 - 62:18)
i am all for it (62:16 - 62:20)
yes this needs to be a real challenge (62:18 - 62:22)
thank you i mean i get being (62:20 - 62:22)
disappointed (62:22 - 62:26)
right like it's going to take you longer (62:22 - 62:29)
having having crammed getting to level (62:26 - 62:30)
40 (62:29 - 62:33)
in a month from nearing the end of 38 (62:30 - 62:34)
and then all the way (62:33 - 62:37)
up to 40. it's not it's not fun (62:34 - 62:39)
but it's also you know it took me half (62:37 - 62:40)
an hour a day (62:39 - 62:43)
of doing it i mean i get being (62:40 - 62:44)
disappointed but (62:43 - 62:47)
also they had said back in the eighth (62:44 - 62:48)
that there were going to be multiple (62:47 - 62:49)
steps to it (62:48 - 62:52)
and then also that was during their big (62:49 - 62:54)
push for you to get to 40 (62:52 - 62:57)
i don't know that having the 40 be a (62:54 - 62:58)
requirement (62:57 - 63:02)
was that much of a surprise because they (62:58 - 63:02)
really (63:02 - 63:06)
stressed all of november (63:02 - 63:10)
and december hey get to 40 by the end of (63:06 - 63:12)
the year and we'll give you special (63:10 - 63:13)
things (63:12 - 63:16)
without saying because you're gonna need (63:13 - 63:17)
to be at level 40. (63:16 - 63:21)
like they were pretty obvious about (63:17 - 63:23)
they felt getting to level 40 was (63:21 - 63:26)
important by the end of the year (63:23 - 63:27)
yeah and that's one of the main reasons (63:26 - 63:29)
why i did it because i'm like (63:27 - 63:33)
okay there is something coming that (63:29 - 63:37)
that is hinged on being level 40 because (63:33 - 63:37)
they (63:37 - 63:41)
they have never really pushed that (63:37 - 63:44)
level true very true until the end of (63:41 - 63:45)
last year (63:44 - 63:46)
yeah i didn't talk about that last night (63:45 - 63:48)
but i think that's like a super good (63:46 - 63:50)
point like this game has existed for (63:48 - 63:52)
we say five years it'll be five years in (63:50 - 63:54)
july there has been (63:52 - 63:56)
never a reason to get to 40. and they (63:54 - 63:58)
did make a big deal about it in december (63:56 - 64:00)
of like hey you want to get to level 40. (63:58 - 64:01)
not specifically because like there's (64:00 - 64:02)
anything that happens when you get to (64:01 - 64:03)
level 50 but (64:02 - 64:05)
if if you're going to have a game that (64:03 - 64:07)
has levels (64:05 - 64:09)
and the levels should like but if no one (64:07 - 64:10)
cares about getting (64:09 - 64:14)
to the levels then why have the levels (64:10 - 64:17)
yeah like levels should be there to (64:14 - 64:19)
push you to do something right the game (64:17 - 64:20)
should always (64:19 - 64:23)
ge games should give you a carrot on a (64:20 - 64:24)
stick (64:23 - 64:26)
to complete something and that now they (64:24 - 64:28)
have something that i feel (64:26 - 64:31)
personally is worthy of getting to 40. (64:28 - 64:34)
yeah oh absolutely yeah oh yeah i mean (64:31 - 64:36)
and i get it like (64:34 - 64:38)
being disappointed because you're not (64:36 - 64:40)
there yet and it's going to take you (64:38 - 64:40)
longer (64:40 - 64:43)
that is a very valid feeling right like (64:40 - 64:45)
you can feel disappointed about a lot of (64:43 - 64:47)
things and that's not to (64:45 - 64:50)
say that that's not valid but (64:47 - 64:52)
they aren't going to give everything (64:50 - 64:53)
away (64:52 - 64:57)
at the start and there does have to be (64:53 - 65:00)
some level of holding out to see (64:57 - 65:02)
is this event going to be really worth (65:00 - 65:04)
it because we talked about it like (65:02 - 65:07)
i had no i was not sure that (65:04 - 65:08)
when this was first announced that i (65:07 - 65:10)
wanted to pay this money for what they (65:08 - 65:13)
announced this event to be (65:10 - 65:15)
like even with the shiny mew at the end (65:13 - 65:16)
it was (65:15 - 65:18)
the main draw was because we had sort of (65:16 - 65:20)
agreed we're just gonna do it and i'm (65:18 - 65:22)
paying for that day (65:20 - 65:24)
but i was very hesitant about buying for (65:22 - 65:25)
the experience (65:24 - 65:28)
yes for that very reason because i just (65:25 - 65:30)
didn't know what was coming (65:28 - 65:32)
and i don't i don't think that's (65:30 - 65:34)
necessarily the fault (65:32 - 65:35)
of a company that wants to build (65:34 - 65:37)
excitement your disappointment (65:35 - 65:39)
i think people's disappointment that (65:37 - 65:41)
this is indeed what (65:39 - 65:43)
what you have to do and it does feel (65:41 - 65:44)
like a lot (65:43 - 65:46)
and you may live in an area where you (65:44 - 65:48)
can't hit 151 (65:46 - 65:50)
stops like there's a lot of reasons to (65:48 - 65:52)
be disappointed in that (65:50 - 65:55)
thing that they chose and that's okay to (65:52 - 65:57)
feel disappointed about that (65:55 - 66:00)
but also there's reasons to make that (65:57 - 66:02)
whole thing feel epic (66:00 - 66:03)
and the fact that you can just have it (66:02 - 66:05)
sitting in there for years and then (66:03 - 66:07)
finally (66:05 - 66:09)
things have loosened up and you're it (66:07 - 66:10)
you travel to new city (66:09 - 66:12)
and you do all the things and suddenly (66:10 - 66:13)
it happens for you (66:12 - 66:15)
that moment is still very exciting that (66:13 - 66:18)
you finally completed this epic journey (66:15 - 66:19)
i mean i think that's really what they (66:18 - 66:21)
wanted to give this so (66:19 - 66:23)
the initial like i mean i'll admit it (66:21 - 66:25)
looking at it thinking i have three (66:23 - 66:26)
months to walk (66:25 - 66:29)
all of these kilometers because (66:26 - 66:31)
generally going outside is (66:29 - 66:33)
unappealing for six of months of the (66:31 - 66:34)
year (66:33 - 66:35)
like yeah it's going to take me a long (66:34 - 66:36)
time to get there and that is (66:35 - 66:38)
disappointing that that's a hurdle that (66:36 - 66:39)
i have to cross (66:38 - 66:42)
but it'll feel great once i cross it and (66:39 - 66:43)
honestly (66:42 - 66:45)
reducing the counter argument down to (66:43 - 66:47)
its most basic level it's (66:45 - 66:49)
boy they've come up with this incredible (66:47 - 66:51)
reward that you have to work really hard (66:49 - 66:53)
you know you have to play the game (66:51 - 66:55)
really hard to get this incredible (66:53 - 66:56)
reward (66:55 - 66:58)
well no i just want them to give me the (66:56 - 66:59)
reward without playing the game (66:58 - 67:01)
well i think the thought process from (66:59 - 67:02)
some people is well i paid the twelve (67:01 - 67:04)
dollars just give it to me (67:02 - 67:05)
you're paying twelve dollars for the (67:04 - 67:07)
experience of playing the game (67:05 - 67:10)
it's like the standard pokemon it's the (67:07 - 67:11)
problem with (67:10 - 67:14)
people associating pokemon with money um (67:11 - 67:15)
and we'll never get away from it it's (67:14 - 67:17)
the same argument for the (67:15 - 67:19)
pokeball plus and it's so frustrating (67:17 - 67:21)
where like i mean they did that to (67:19 - 67:22)
themselves (67:21 - 67:24)
they have made that connection because (67:22 - 67:25)
things have come with (67:24 - 67:27)
i don't think they did like if you put (67:25 - 67:29)
out the pokeball plus which is a working (67:27 - 67:31)
controller it was 50 (67:29 - 67:33)
the the pokeball go plus was 35 so (67:31 - 67:35)
you're paying 15 more dollars for (67:33 - 67:36)
something that (67:35 - 67:39)
does what the 35 thing did plus it (67:36 - 67:40)
connects to the switch (67:39 - 67:42)
plus it connects to sword and shield (67:40 - 67:43)
plus it connects to let's go pikachu (67:42 - 67:44)
let's go eevee (67:43 - 67:46)
and then on top of that they were like (67:44 - 67:48)
well you know what let's give them a (67:46 - 67:49)
free mew (67:48 - 67:51)
like that is the thought process you are (67:49 - 67:53)
paying 50 for a piece of hardware that (67:51 - 67:55)
does what another piece of hardware does (67:53 - 67:57)
for 35 dollars but it also does more (67:55 - 67:57)
things (67:57 - 67:59)
and they were just being nice of giving (67:57 - 68:01)
them you but the pokemon fans are so (67:59 - 68:04)
backwards they can't comprehend (68:01 - 68:06)
that this is a working controller and (68:04 - 68:08)
they go oh it's 50 for a mew (68:06 - 68:10)
no the mew was just like the bonus thing (68:08 - 68:11)
they added on saying thank you for (68:10 - 68:13)
buying this cool controller we made (68:11 - 68:15)
that i still use every day like i think (68:13 - 68:17)
it i think that controller is a million (68:15 - 68:19)
percent worth fifty dollars and it is i (68:17 - 68:21)
love it yes i've been using it for years (68:19 - 68:24)
it's nice that it came with a mew but in (68:21 - 68:24)
no (68:24 - 68:27)
situation where i i was ever like well (68:24 - 68:29)
gosh why do they hide on you behind a 50 (68:27 - 68:32)
pay wall it is such backwards thinking (68:29 - 68:34)
like how can you discredit the entire (68:32 - 68:35)
product that they were like (68:34 - 68:39)
here's a free mew but like it's so weird (68:35 - 68:41)
to me that people think this way (68:39 - 68:44)
i don't think it's that weird i don't (68:41 - 68:45)
think it's that weird at all (68:44 - 68:48)
because that's a selling point of the (68:45 - 68:49)
thing like (68:48 - 68:51)
a million people would have looked at it (68:49 - 68:52)
and said i don't need that (68:51 - 68:55)
i don't need another controller i don't (68:52 - 68:57)
need this thing that does this one thing (68:55 - 68:59)
for this one game (68:57 - 69:01)
i don't really need that in my life oh (68:59 - 69:03)
it comes with a mew (69:01 - 69:04)
yeah that's enough to send me to buy (69:03 - 69:07)
that that's like that is great parts of (69:04 - 69:08)
me though (69:07 - 69:12)
why who's good because that's exactly (69:08 - 69:12)
a lot of people like it's a list of (69:12 - 69:17)
benefits and that's a thing that pushes (69:15 - 69:18)
you over (69:17 - 69:19)
it's like the same with a billion phones (69:18 - 69:21)
like i don't care about the camera i (69:19 - 69:22)
don't care about oh the screen (69:21 - 69:23)
resolution's better okay i'm getting (69:22 - 69:24)
that for that one thing (69:23 - 69:27)
yeah that's a good that's a good analogy (69:24 - 69:28)
i think i don't know people buy hacked (69:27 - 69:30)
pokemon off ebay (69:28 - 69:33)
yeah yeah yeah you're talking about (69:30 - 69:35)
people's thought processes of the list (69:33 - 69:37)
of things that pushes them over (69:35 - 69:38)
that's one of the things that pushes (69:37 - 69:40)
them over a lot of people thinking i (69:38 - 69:43)
have to collect 151 (69:40 - 69:45)
pokemon that i've been catching since (69:43 - 69:47)
the start of this game which is (69:45 - 69:50)
five years now is not worth it oh it (69:47 - 69:51)
leads me to this (69:50 - 69:53)
okay now that's probably worth it is a (69:51 - 69:54)
yet another list of benefits (69:53 - 69:56)
and when that benefit is the thing that (69:54 - 69:58)
sells you that's the thing that you (69:56 - 70:00)
associate with that cost (69:58 - 70:02)
if everything else again i've said this (70:00 - 70:04)
before if all the other things that you (70:02 - 70:04)
call our (70:04 - 70:08)
value ads aren't of value to you (70:04 - 70:11)
they don't matter the thing that (70:08 - 70:13)
adds the value is the thing that (70:11 - 70:15)
actually matters when you're making that (70:13 - 70:17)
decision so let's talk about how to get (70:15 - 70:18)
to 40 (70:17 - 70:21)
because because i did it in a month (70:18 - 70:24)
yes crack crack them lucky eggs do lots (70:21 - 70:24)
of rage (70:24 - 70:27)
i don't want to ever tell people to like (70:24 - 70:29)
spend money on lucky eggs to get to 40. (70:27 - 70:31)
they okay and this is what we talked (70:29 - 70:33)
about the other night they have made it (70:31 - 70:36)
significantly easier to get to level 40 (70:33 - 70:37)
over the years they didn't like (70:36 - 70:39)
they did make some changes recently to (70:37 - 70:42)
make it easier but the biggest thing (70:39 - 70:46)
that can get you to level 40 is (70:42 - 70:48)
the friendship stuff yep and that is (70:46 - 70:50)
that has been a feature that has existed (70:48 - 70:51)
for over a year (70:50 - 70:54)
and if you don't know how it works (70:51 - 70:55)
because uh (70:54 - 70:58)
i i i don't know that i have to explain (70:55 - 70:58)
this uh (70:58 - 71:00)
to some people on twitch but i'll (70:58 - 71:02)
explain it to some people in the podcast (71:00 - 71:04)
what happens is uh you can have 200 (71:02 - 71:06)
friends on your friends list (71:04 - 71:09)
and you can send and receive gifts and (71:06 - 71:12)
you get experience when you hit great (71:09 - 71:13)
friends (71:12 - 71:15)
ultra friends and best friends (71:13 - 71:16)
specifically you gain 10 (71:15 - 71:18)
000 experience which is the equivalent (71:16 - 71:20)
to one raid for (71:18 - 71:21)
opening gifts for seven days with a (71:20 - 71:23)
person (71:21 - 71:28)
and then you receive 50 000 experience (71:23 - 71:30)
for being 30-day friends with a person (71:28 - 71:32)
uh and then you (71:30 - 71:34)
for i think the last one is like 45 days (71:32 - 71:36)
or like 50 days or something (71:34 - 71:38)
all together it's like 90 days total um (71:36 - 71:39)
and then for best friends (71:38 - 71:42)
you get a hundred thousand experience (71:39 - 71:43)
for just (71:42 - 71:45)
sending and receiving gifts you don't (71:43 - 71:46)
even have to send them (71:45 - 71:47)
if you have somebody on your friend's (71:46 - 71:48)
list who loves sending gifts all you (71:47 - 71:50)
gotta do is open them (71:48 - 71:52)
pro tip again because people don't know (71:50 - 71:53)
this when you open a gift or when your (71:52 - 71:55)
friend opened it's a gift (71:53 - 71:57)
a little blue circle will appear around (71:55 - 71:58)
your friend meaning there has been some (71:57 - 72:00)
sort of interaction that day (71:58 - 72:02)
that means if you sent your friend a (72:00 - 72:04)
gift and they sent you a gift (72:02 - 72:06)
and they opened your gift you will see a (72:04 - 72:07)
blue circle which means you don't have (72:06 - 72:09)
to open their gift you can save it until (72:07 - 72:10)
the next day (72:09 - 72:13)
and then you can open it because you you (72:10 - 72:15)
both opening each other's gift the same (72:13 - 72:15)
day (72:15 - 72:17)
only accounts for one interaction you (72:15 - 72:18)
can only get one interaction a day with (72:17 - 72:20)
that friend (72:18 - 72:23)
if you're working to build that with a (72:20 - 72:24)
person (72:23 - 72:25)
for example if i was looking to build (72:24 - 72:27)
that with will will opens my gift on (72:25 - 72:29)
monday i open will's gift on tuesday (72:27 - 72:31)
will opens my gift on wednesday so we're (72:29 - 72:32)
both not opening (72:31 - 72:34)
the same gifts every day so we can (72:32 - 72:35)
stagger it (72:34 - 72:37)
so it's efficient as possible that means (72:35 - 72:39)
i can save those other gifts for other (72:37 - 72:41)
people or i can open other gifts from (72:39 - 72:41)
other people (72:41 - 72:44)
because you can only open 30 gifts a day (72:41 - 72:48)
you can send a hundred gifts a day now (72:44 - 72:49)
why i'm bringing this up because this is (72:48 - 72:50)
the best way (72:49 - 72:54)
to get experience if you picked (72:50 - 72:57)
10 people and you were going to be best (72:54 - 72:58)
friends with those (72:57 - 73:00)
10 people and if that is the point where (72:58 - 73:02)
you decide to pop a lucky egg which the (73:00 - 73:03)
lucky egg does work with so instead of (73:02 - 73:04)
ten thousand for (73:03 - 73:06)
great friends you're getting twenty (73:04 - 73:07)
thousand instead of getting fifty (73:06 - 73:08)
thousand for ultra friends you're (73:07 - 73:09)
getting a hundred thousand (73:08 - 73:11)
instead of getting a hundred thousand (73:09 - 73:12)
for best friends you're getting two (73:11 - 73:13)
hundred thousand (73:12 - 73:16)
some basic math here if you do this with (73:13 - 73:17)
ten people (73:16 - 73:18)
and you pop a lucky egg you're going to (73:17 - 73:20)
get 2 million xp (73:18 - 73:22)
that day in in in literal seconds (73:20 - 73:24)
because all it takes is opening 10 gifts (73:22 - 73:27)
or sending 10 gifts 2 million xp will (73:24 - 73:30)
get you from level 1 in pogo to level 30 (73:27 - 73:34)
in pogo instantly that is how (73:30 - 73:36)
much experience you're getting from just (73:34 - 73:38)
interacting with a friend feature (73:36 - 73:39)
and you'll want to interact with it (73:38 - 73:41)
because it gives you pokeballs it gives (73:39 - 73:42)
you potions it gives you berries (73:41 - 73:45)
they're literally free items if you have (73:42 - 73:46)
gotten to this point (73:45 - 73:48)
in pogo and you're not using that (73:46 - 73:51)
feature because you don't have friends (73:48 - 73:53)
that is like playing an mmo and (73:51 - 73:55)
literally not talking to a single person (73:53 - 73:56)
throughout your journey (73:55 - 73:58)
[Laughter] (73:56 - 74:00)
like you don't play final fantasy 14 (73:58 - 74:02)
because you're looking for a great (74:00 - 74:03)
single-player experience (74:02 - 74:05)
you're not logging into wild daily to (74:03 - 74:07)
never interact with another human being (74:05 - 74:08)
on the other hand (74:07 - 74:09)
there are people that do that they don't (74:08 - 74:11)
play for various are people that do that (74:09 - 74:12)
they're out of their minds (74:11 - 74:15)
but if you have twitter if you ain't a (74:12 - 74:16)
discord (74:15 - 74:18)
if you're in our slack community there (74:16 - 74:19)
are ways (74:18 - 74:20)
to find other people and you don't even (74:19 - 74:22)
need a lot like i said in my example (74:20 - 74:24)
that was just 10 people i know that i'm (74:22 - 74:26)
in a situation where like people want to (74:24 - 74:27)
be my friend (74:26 - 74:29)
i host a pokemon podcast it's very easy (74:27 - 74:30)
for me to put my friend code out and get (74:29 - 74:32)
like 50 requests on twitter (74:30 - 74:35)
very quickly i get it very privileged in (74:32 - 74:36)
that instance (74:35 - 74:38)
but i've also been that person where (74:36 - 74:39)
like no one knew (74:38 - 74:41)
who i'm at who i am i'm at a park in a (74:39 - 74:42)
raid (74:41 - 74:44)
and it's very easy just to be like hey (74:42 - 74:45)
does anyone want to exchange friend (74:44 - 74:46)
codes (74:45 - 74:48)
with your local group that's hard now (74:46 - 74:49)
because of the pandemic (74:48 - 74:51)
but i would strongly suggest to people (74:49 - 74:53)
who are not level 40 (74:51 - 74:55)
who are disappointed about this new (74:53 - 74:57)
event to start using the gift feature (74:55 - 75:00)
the other thing i want to bring up is (74:57 - 75:01)
they did change (75:00 - 75:03)
it the catching stuff to make it easier (75:01 - 75:04)
to get to level 40. (75:03 - 75:08)
so now if you get an excellent throw (75:04 - 75:10)
on a pokemon you get a thousand (75:08 - 75:12)
experience instead of a hundred (75:10 - 75:15)
so think about this if you catch 10 (75:12 - 75:17)
pokemon with excellent throws (75:15 - 75:20)
that is like catching 50 pokemon (75:17 - 75:22)
normally that didn't exist they (75:20 - 75:24)
introduced that in december (75:22 - 75:26)
so 50 pokemon is a lot of pokemon to (75:24 - 75:29)
catch it in the sense of that it's it's (75:26 - 75:30)
kind of time consuming because you got (75:29 - 75:31)
to throw the pokeball you gotta wait for (75:30 - 75:33)
it to shake you gotta go do the click (75:31 - 75:34)
you go through the thing (75:33 - 75:35)
if you get 10 excellent throws that's (75:34 - 75:37)
equivalent to catching 50 pokemon back (75:35 - 75:38)
in the older day they've (75:37 - 75:40)
definitely made it easier between (75:38 - 75:43)
friendship between experience (75:40 - 75:44)
all of december it was like double xp or (75:43 - 75:46)
whatever yeah (75:44 - 75:48)
i will say excellent throws aren't that (75:46 - 75:51)
easy to do excellent throws are not that (75:48 - 75:52)
easy (75:51 - 75:54)
you can get better at it being as bad as (75:52 - 75:55)
it is (75:54 - 75:58)
i i swear i hit it in there the game's (75:55 - 75:59)
like (75:58 - 76:02)
nope and and and the game (75:59 - 76:04)
will say oh that was the next info it (76:02 - 76:05)
breaks out i will throw (76:04 - 76:09)
the worst throw i have hits (76:05 - 76:11)
just barely on the edge of the ring (76:09 - 76:12)
catches (76:11 - 76:14)
frustrating that is frustrating there (76:12 - 76:16)
are some pokemon that are throws (76:14 - 76:17)
really good at excellent throws mr mimes (76:16 - 76:19)
kangaskhan now frauds (76:17 - 76:21)
nil (76:19 - 76:21)
uh nose pass snorlax lapras there are (76:23 - 76:27)
there (76:26 - 76:29)
so my advice would be figure out which (76:27 - 76:30)
pokemon you're really good at excellent (76:29 - 76:31)
throwing (76:30 - 76:34)
anytime you see those just i i look (76:31 - 76:37)
i am i i am an average pokemon player (76:34 - 76:38)
sometimes i see (76:37 - 76:41)
10 pokemon in my house and i go i'm not (76:38 - 76:42)
catching any of these (76:41 - 76:43)
because i don't want to go through that (76:42 - 76:45)
more than average and then sometimes (76:43 - 76:47)
like this is wildly full of pokemon (76:45 - 76:49)
because you're near (76:47 - 76:52)
something and sometimes there's like (76:49 - 76:52)
four (76:52 - 76:54)
there's like four nidorans in my house (76:52 - 76:56)
and i do the thing i tap on all of them (76:54 - 76:57)
i go none of these are shiny but i don't (76:56 - 76:58)
bother on catching (76:57 - 77:00)
catching them i get it i'm there but (76:58 - 77:02)
there are some pokemon i know for sure i (77:00 - 77:04)
excellent throw those are always pokemon (77:02 - 77:05)
i catch no matter what because i know i (77:04 - 77:06)
can hit the excellent throw (77:05 - 77:09)
and it's very easy experience but again (77:06 - 77:11)
i get it it sucks that you're not level (77:09 - 77:12)
40. i don't (77:11 - 77:14)
think it's the end of the world i do (77:12 - 77:15)
think (77:14 - 77:19)
that shiny mew should feel (77:15 - 77:22)
special i do think it should feel like (77:19 - 77:23)
an accomplishment (77:22 - 77:25)
you are still going to get it it might (77:23 - 77:26)
take time (77:25 - 77:28)
it's not the end of the world if it's (77:26 - 77:29)
not in your collection right away (77:28 - 77:32)
yeah also you get you get a higher first (77:29 - 77:33)
catch bonus (77:32 - 77:35)
in the morning so the first thing you (77:33 - 77:36)
catch also gets gives you more (77:35 - 77:37)
experience (77:36 - 77:39)
and the seven day experience is higher (77:37 - 77:40)
when they have (77:39 - 77:43)
they have closed that gap right you get (77:40 - 77:45)
a lot more from the seven day streak and (77:43 - 77:47)
you get a lot more for catching your (77:45 - 77:49)
first pokemon in the day (77:47 - 77:51)
it also is like that weird conversation (77:49 - 77:52)
that we've (77:51 - 77:55)
we we dance around which is like you (77:52 - 77:57)
have half of the people being like (77:55 - 77:58)
they make mythicals too easy nowaday (77:57 - 78:00)
they're just qr codes they're just (77:58 - 78:02)
they're just distributions and it's like (78:00 - 78:04)
they finally do something cool here (78:02 - 78:06)
whether or not you think it's cool or (78:04 - 78:08)
not because you have to be level 40. but (78:06 - 78:11)
they do make you work for it in a way (78:08 - 78:12)
and there is a story attached to this (78:11 - 78:14)
right because every time you complete (78:12 - 78:16)
in pogo every time you complete a (78:14 - 78:18)
research it walks you along a story (78:16 - 78:20)
and so they attached a whole story and (78:18 - 78:22)
event to this (78:20 - 78:23)
on top of attaching a whole story an (78:22 - 78:26)
event to the saturday thing (78:23 - 78:28)
so you're getting a lot for twelve (78:26 - 78:30)
dollars but i i (78:28 - 78:32)
get even though i disagree with that (78:30 - 78:33)
there are people that are thinking (78:32 - 78:35)
i don't care about any of that and the (78:33 - 78:36)
twelve dollars is just (78:35 - 78:39)
specifically for this mew and nothing (78:36 - 78:40)
else associated with it (78:39 - 78:43)
what is the expression it's like you can (78:40 - 78:45)
you can disappoint some of the people (78:43 - 78:46)
some of the time but you can't (78:45 - 78:47)
disappoint (78:46 - 78:51)
all of the people i don't know that it's (78:47 - 78:53)
disappointing (78:51 - 78:56)
oh it is in this context i mean (78:53 - 79:00)
you everybody's experiences will (78:56 - 79:03)
will vary based off of your expectations (79:00 - 79:03)
that (79:03 - 79:08)
is that is a common life stressor (79:03 - 79:10)
the further something is away from what (79:08 - 79:12)
you expected it to be (79:10 - 79:14)
the gap between the two is your just (79:12 - 79:16)
happiness and stress (79:14 - 79:18)
there's not a lot to do about that like (79:16 - 79:19)
learn (79:18 - 79:22)
this time make decisions like if your (79:19 - 79:23)
decision is never to play pokemon go (79:22 - 79:24)
again (79:23 - 79:27)
that is your decision and it's a valid (79:24 - 79:29)
decision (79:27 - 79:31)
because you're the smart decision i mean (79:29 - 79:33)
your experience was negative (79:31 - 79:36)
and they have shown their hand multiple (79:33 - 79:37)
times (79:36 - 79:39)
this is how they run this company this (79:37 - 79:41)
is how they run this game (79:39 - 79:43)
this is how they do events i don't think (79:41 - 79:44)
this is necessarily bad in the sense of (79:43 - 79:45)
like (79:44 - 79:48)
it's not like if you think about it in a (79:45 - 79:49)
content (79:48 - 79:51)
form like people are always desperate (79:49 - 79:53)
people always want new content like look (79:51 - 79:54)
at people who still talk about pokemon (79:53 - 79:55)
quest (79:54 - 79:56)
oh i wish there would be gen 2 for (79:55 - 79:58)
pokemon quest yeah i mean i guess (79:56 - 80:01)
like i don't know like how like i think (79:58 - 80:02)
of it in a sense of like okay what would (80:01 - 80:04)
adding 100 pokemon do like yeah i guess (80:02 - 80:06)
you can like collect them but it's still (80:04 - 80:07)
like the same (80:06 - 80:08)
like pokemon quest i think was like a (80:07 - 80:10)
very good package like it didn't (80:08 - 80:11)
overstay its welcome (80:10 - 80:14)
it was very delightful it was very fun i (80:11 - 80:16)
don't think adding more pokemon (80:14 - 80:19)
for a paid monetary cost would be like a (80:16 - 80:21)
good enough reason to go back to it (80:19 - 80:21)
unless they (80:21 - 80:24)
dramatically change something (80:21 - 80:27)
it's not a good enough reason for you (80:24 - 80:28)
but in a sense for (80:27 - 80:31)
like pokemon go you're paying 12.99 (80:28 - 80:33)
you're getting an a 12 (80:31 - 80:36)
hour event you're getting a shiny ditto (80:33 - 80:38)
at the end of it when you complete it (80:36 - 80:39)
but you're you're getting (80:38 - 80:41)
that entire experience and they're (80:39 - 80:42)
giving you (80:41 - 80:45)
more content that you can just do (80:42 - 80:46)
throughout (80:45 - 80:47)
however long it's going to take you a (80:46 - 80:49)
week two weeks two months (80:47 - 80:52)
a year like you are they're giving you (80:49 - 80:53)
content to (80:52 - 80:56)
keep you playing their game and ideally (80:53 - 80:57)
hopefully i would assume you're playing (80:56 - 80:57)
your (80:57 - 80:59)
their game because you like their game (80:57 - 81:01)
so it's kind of weird to be like ugh i (80:59 - 81:02)
wish they would just give me the shiny (81:01 - 81:03)
mew (81:02 - 81:05)
yeah but then what are you gonna do not (81:03 - 81:06)
play the game that you're (81:05 - 81:09)
hopefully like to play like i i it's (81:06 - 81:11)
kind of like a double-edged sword (81:09 - 81:13)
almost because they're giving you (81:11 - 81:14)
content (81:13 - 81:18)
and if if shiny mew being probably the (81:14 - 81:19)
thing that people (81:18 - 81:21)
wanted the most outside of pokemon go (81:19 - 81:23)
and in pokemon go right like (81:21 - 81:25)
it's not like so this is not a wanted (81:23 - 81:27)
thing exclusive to pokemon go people (81:25 - 81:28)
who play sword and shield also want (81:27 - 81:30)
shiny mew like they're giving you a lot (81:28 - 81:31)
of cut like they're giving you a reason (81:30 - 81:32)
to play the game (81:31 - 81:34)
i don't know it's just i guess they can (81:32 - 81:36)
just get you just pay it they give it to (81:34 - 81:38)
you and you go okay well now i have (81:36 - 81:39)
nothing to do (81:38 - 81:42)
i don't i don't know it just i it's hard (81:39 - 81:43)
for me to see it as like a huge (81:42 - 81:44)
complaint (81:43 - 81:46)
but also i'm level 40 so i don't know (81:44 - 81:48)
how it would be like (81:46 - 81:49)
but i'm level 40 because i like playing (81:48 - 81:52)
go yeah i mean i (81:49 - 81:54)
i will i will be the person that does (81:52 - 81:57)
not particularly like playing go (81:54 - 82:00)
i check in because i do like it is just (81:57 - 82:02)
a habit it's a thing i do (82:00 - 82:05)
there are days with trying to push to 40 (82:02 - 82:06)
in december (82:05 - 82:08)
actively made me hate that game and i (82:06 - 82:10)
didn't play for a week after (82:08 - 82:12)
because that level of grind and the (82:10 - 82:14)
level of demand (82:12 - 82:16)
that something that's supposed to be fun (82:14 - 82:18)
was putting on me (82:16 - 82:21)
wasn't fun so i get it like having to (82:18 - 82:23)
having to basically grind your way (82:21 - 82:24)
through a level (82:23 - 82:27)
to start to the thing you want isn't fun (82:24 - 82:28)
grinding (82:27 - 82:31)
isn't fun and it's also true that like (82:28 - 82:33)
they're not just gonna give it away they (82:31 - 82:35)
just aren't they are going to build in (82:33 - 82:36)
things (82:35 - 82:40)
to make you play that game and if that (82:36 - 82:43)
if that attitude is something you can't (82:40 - 82:44)
stand (82:43 - 82:47)
then don't like how they're gonna run (82:44 - 82:49)
this game isn't for you (82:47 - 82:51)
and that is a fine breaking point like (82:49 - 82:53)
whenever you see the money behind it and (82:51 - 82:54)
it's not (82:53 - 82:57)
fun you're just seeing the money then (82:54 - 83:00)
you're probably done with the game (82:57 - 83:02)
because it's it's too much of a burden (83:00 - 83:03)
and (83:02 - 83:05)
i i mean i agree pushing to 40 in (83:03 - 83:06)
december was (83:05 - 83:09)
bad for me i did not enjoy it i resented (83:06 - 83:12)
the game i resented what i had to do (83:09 - 83:14)
i resented the mechanics more than i (83:12 - 83:16)
ever have in that game when they didn't (83:14 - 83:17)
work (83:16 - 83:21)
so i i get that i get that (83:17 - 83:23)
having to grind to a certain level to (83:21 - 83:24)
get what you want (83:23 - 83:27)
is not a fun experience it is fun for (83:24 - 83:27)
some people (83:27 - 83:30)
a lot of people love that i mean people (83:27 - 83:31)
grind in games (83:30 - 83:32)
all the time because the end reward is (83:31 - 83:34)
great i gr i (83:32 - 83:37)
have literally run the same dungeons and (83:34 - 83:41)
raids in final fantasy 14 for five (83:37 - 83:43)
months now because i enjoy the people (83:41 - 83:44)
that i play with i enjoy (83:43 - 83:46)
working towards the rewards at the end (83:44 - 83:49)
and i still enjoy that experience (83:46 - 83:52)
but i have hit the wall in many games (83:49 - 83:55)
where i've realized this is just a grind (83:52 - 83:57)
and i'm not enjoying this anymore and (83:55 - 83:58)
i've left (83:57 - 84:01)
that value slides for us for many many (83:58 - 84:02)
people (84:01 - 84:05)
do we end with don't pay money for (84:02 - 84:07)
something you don't know the full (84:05 - 84:08)
details (84:07 - 84:10)
about i mean that is just that is just a (84:08 - 84:11)
buyer's beware (84:10 - 84:14)
in general like don't pre-order (84:11 - 84:15)
something if you don't know how it's (84:14 - 84:16)
going to work (84:15 - 84:19)
like unless you're absolutely rock solid (84:16 - 84:21)
and exact like you know oh (84:19 - 84:23)
it's it is this thing and i know exactly (84:21 - 84:24)
what they're going to do with it (84:23 - 84:27)
like never pre-order if you're at all (84:24 - 84:28)
questioning it (84:27 - 84:32)
on any product any any anything (84:28 - 84:34)
let's make it pokemon go specific now (84:32 - 84:36)
did they say (84:34 - 84:38)
only a limited number of people can buy (84:36 - 84:39)
this event too no no no (84:38 - 84:42)
yeah there was unlimited supply guess (84:39 - 84:43)
what (84:42 - 84:44)
wait until the day before it happens (84:43 - 84:46)
yeah if you ain't tickled (84:44 - 84:48)
the day before it happens then don't i (84:46 - 84:50)
guess you could maybe be like (84:48 - 84:52)
well i wanted the community day for (84:50 - 84:53)
january i wanted the community for (84:52 - 84:55)
february but (84:53 - 84:58)
then once again you got two experiences (84:55 - 84:59)
for thirteen dollars (84:58 - 85:02)
you got what you paid for yeah but yeah (84:59 - 85:02)
i agree (85:02 - 85:04)
i i don't agree with you well but also (85:02 - 85:05)
you didn't even know what those (85:04 - 85:06)
communities were (85:05 - 85:08)
so like is the thought process you were (85:06 - 85:10)
gonna buy them anyways (85:08 - 85:12)
like i don't know i i have purchased (85:10 - 85:13)
every single (85:12 - 85:16)
one because i like the only reason why i (85:13 - 85:17)
have (85:16 - 85:19)
i did the mod match up ones because i (85:17 - 85:20)
bought this ticket (85:19 - 85:22)
i probably would not have and guess what (85:20 - 85:24)
i didn't do the machop one because i was (85:22 - 85:26)
asleep through the whole thing and you (85:24 - 85:26)
know what (85:26 - 85:29)
heart is still not broken i would have (85:26 - 85:31)
of the ones i would have purchased the (85:29 - 85:33)
rosalia one because i love (85:31 - 85:36)
that pokemon today oh heck yeah but i (85:33 - 85:37)
haven't had a great day (85:36 - 85:39)
together but i haven't done a lot of the (85:37 - 85:41)
special researches for those others days (85:39 - 85:44)
like me buying the kanto ticket was (85:41 - 85:47)
not those those free research days were (85:44 - 85:49)
not a part of that equation (85:47 - 85:51)
i i would have wouldn't have purchased (85:49 - 85:53)
them depending on what the day is and i (85:51 - 85:55)
wouldn't have purchased the january one (85:53 - 85:58)
but still fundamentally if (85:55 - 86:02)
something is unlimited supply wait (85:58 - 86:05)
until you absolutely have to buy it (86:02 - 86:08)
unlimited supply and no cutoff date like (86:05 - 86:09)
you can buy it up until the day of the (86:08 - 86:10)
event (86:09 - 86:13)
you can buy it during it yeah just wait (86:10 - 86:16)
i mean i i hope people have fun this (86:13 - 86:17)
weekend (86:16 - 86:19)
i mean i plan on having fun this weekend (86:17 - 86:20)
i mean yeah (86:19 - 86:23)
i i think you can have a good time like (86:20 - 86:24)
i think (86:23 - 86:26)
i mean i'm not super looking forward to (86:24 - 86:27)
playing (86:26 - 86:30)
indoors no uh specifically around other (86:27 - 86:31)
people but (86:30 - 86:34)
we may have a miracle hot front we may (86:31 - 86:36)
come through we might (86:34 - 86:37)
supply our other option was to go to (86:36 - 86:40)
texas and play outdoors (86:37 - 86:42)
yeah but uh boy it sounds like that (86:40 - 86:44)
would have been a just as bad decision (86:42 - 86:45)
because it's about 20 degrees out in (86:44 - 86:47)
texas right now (86:45 - 86:49)
i mean i will say this saturday is (86:47 - 86:51)
predicted to be 23 (86:49 - 86:54)
which is toasty that is (86:51 - 86:58)
a that's shorts weather man (86:54 - 87:01)
minnesota heatwave it is i mean (86:58 - 87:03)
i wouldn't mind being outside it for (87:01 - 87:05)
shorter periods of time after this (87:03 - 87:08)
after these two weeks i know for sure (87:05 - 87:09)
though i like (87:08 - 87:10)
regardless of money or regardless of (87:09 - 87:12)
being level 40 i know for sure i would (87:10 - 87:14)
not have fun with this event if i was (87:12 - 87:14)
sitting (87:14 - 87:16)
in my house for 12 hours absolutely i (87:14 - 87:18)
wouldn't have done it if we hadn't made (87:16 - 87:18)
plans (87:18 - 87:21)
we have we have a couple options if some (87:18 - 87:21)
don't work (87:21 - 87:25)
but yep my fingers are crossed i like to (87:21 - 87:28)
be an opportunist (87:25 - 87:28)
we know that but i think you mean you (87:28 - 87:34)
like to be an optimist (87:30 - 87:34)
and an opportunist mostly you know (87:35 - 87:39)
you're an opportunist (87:38 - 87:42)
that is well proven but your positive (87:39 - 87:43)
attitude is the thing you're trying to (87:42 - 87:46)
highlight right (87:43 - 87:48)
i don't know i'm not even touching this (87:46 - 87:50)
i don't know it is (87:48 - 87:53)
actually well um (87:50 - 87:57)
is that our show is that everything (87:53 - 87:57)
we should i mean i'm assuming since (87:57 - 88:01)
we've been yelling at each other for (88:00 - 88:02)
this long we're skipping question of the (88:01 - 88:04)
week but we still should do pokemon of (88:02 - 88:05)
the week yeah let me just check the (88:04 - 88:06)
slack real quick so we (88:05 - 88:09)
give people their dues uh there was the (88:06 - 88:11)
military event this weekend (88:09 - 88:13)
yep it was the third two shiny milks (88:11 - 88:14)
third time (88:13 - 88:16)
third week in a row they've done an (88:14 - 88:18)
event i don't think there's much to say (88:16 - 88:18)
about it (88:18 - 88:21)
it's kind of the same i would expect (88:18 - 88:22)
there would be an event not (88:21 - 88:24)
this up oh gosh hopefully not this (88:22 - 88:26)
upcoming weekend but i would exp i would (88:24 - 88:29)
soon expect there would be an event at (88:26 - 88:29)
the end of the month (88:29 - 88:33)
for pokemon day um lewis was the one (88:29 - 88:33)
that sent in (88:33 - 88:35)
from our slack community about the (88:33 - 88:37)
addressing the pokemon tcg so thank you (88:35 - 88:39)
luis for that (88:37 - 88:41)
uh and then i i think i think that's it (88:39 - 88:43)
there was some news posted in slack but (88:41 - 88:44)
it's not (88:43 - 88:47)
and we we can save it until next week (88:44 - 88:48)
not dire (88:47 - 88:49)
oh we didn't talk about the umbrella (88:48 - 88:51)
stuff again not dire (88:49 - 88:54)
uh we need stuff to talk about on (88:51 - 88:55)
thursday yeah (88:54 - 88:57)
yeah yeah yeah save it save it for (88:55 - 89:00)
thursday i got a rant for that (88:57 - 89:03)
oh umbrella stuff umbrella they made (89:00 - 89:06)
pokemon rumble (89:03 - 89:09)
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh i thought you meant (89:06 - 89:11)
like bumper shoots (89:09 - 89:13)
i had no idea what either one of you is (89:11 - 89:15)
talking about okay (89:13 - 89:19)
well give us pokemon of the week so i (89:15 - 89:19)
thought (89:19 - 89:23)
that last week's pokemon was going to be (89:19 - 89:24)
challenging (89:23 - 89:26)
but several people did come up with the (89:24 - 89:27)
correct answer (89:26 - 89:31)
so i feel like my clues were justified (89:27 - 89:34)
and as the translation i will say uh (89:31 - 89:34)
number one (89:34 - 89:37)
i referenced greg because greg is (89:34 - 89:38)
brent's husband (89:37 - 89:42)
um and greg's favorite pokemon is (89:38 - 89:45)
roselia and then i said look at the (89:42 - 89:46)
starters (89:45 - 89:48)
and there's only one pokemon without (89:46 - 89:50)
requiring a hidden ability which a lot (89:48 - 89:51)
of people (89:50 - 89:53)
for whatever reason didn't hear those (89:51 - 89:56)
words or being related to a camel which (89:53 - 89:58)
everybody seemed to hear that one (89:56 - 90:01)
uh that is the exact opposite of this (89:58 - 90:02)
pokemon (90:01 - 90:05)
um so and then everybody a lot of people (90:02 - 90:07)
were like well (90:05 - 90:10)
if rosalia is grass poison then water is (90:07 - 90:11)
the opposite of (90:10 - 90:14)
uh of grass and then i was like but i (90:11 - 90:15)
referenced (90:14 - 90:17)
the camo pokemon and there's only so (90:15 - 90:19)
many camel pokemon and then that would (90:17 - 90:21)
clearly be fire so i must have meant (90:19 - 90:23)
that fire is the opposite of grass (90:21 - 90:26)
uh and then i said well whatever and (90:23 - 90:28)
then i said you may need to consult with (90:26 - 90:28)
an (90:28 - 90:30)
oracle to find the answer and this is (90:28 - 90:32)
where my real disappointment was because (90:30 - 90:34)
to me if somebody says oracle i think of (90:32 - 90:37)
one thing and i guess kids these days (90:34 - 90:41)
don't you think of the software company (90:37 - 90:44)
no (90:41 - 90:44)
database company thank you oh well (90:46 - 90:51)
whatever (90:48 - 90:51)
i think all right are we going to have (90:51 - 90:58)
steve's bad guest sure all right (90:55 - 91:02)
it's mr mime (90:58 - 91:06)
oh yuck no it's del fox (91:02 - 91:08)
i mean i guess ice psychic is the (91:06 - 91:10)
opposite of brazil yeah it could be it (91:08 - 91:14)
it's not starter so yeah (91:10 - 91:17)
uh correct it is del fox because when i (91:14 - 91:18)
think of (91:17 - 91:20)
oracle i think of the oracle of delphi (91:18 - 91:22)
from ancient greece (91:20 - 91:24)
which is kind of where we get that term (91:22 - 91:26)
from (91:24 - 91:29)
uh and the pokemon that requires a (91:26 - 91:30)
hidden ability (91:29 - 91:34)
to be fire psychic is darmanitan (91:30 - 91:36)
which is always one of my favorite ones (91:34 - 91:38)
to think of because it was like (91:36 - 91:39)
that one weird one where you could get (91:38 - 91:41)
the hidden ability ones that were (91:39 - 91:43)
standing outside of the (91:41 - 91:44)
palace or temple or whatever in the (91:43 - 91:46)
desert and (91:44 - 91:48)
like those were the only ones that you (91:46 - 91:51)
could get at that point in time (91:48 - 91:53)
uh either way del fox is one of my (91:51 - 91:55)
favorite pokemon i love dale fox so much (91:53 - 91:58)
the shuffle icon is brilliant (91:55 - 92:02)
and the shiny is amazing (91:58 - 92:05)
why is the shiny amazing it's like got (92:02 - 92:06)
this cool (92:05 - 92:10)
purple dress and the fur is gray it just (92:06 - 92:12)
looks so great it's like a really (92:10 - 92:16)
cool uh like it makes it more spooky (92:12 - 92:19)
and is it a dress or a robe yeah (92:16 - 92:22)
it's a robe it's a robe yeah (92:19 - 92:24)
uh delphi is the only star pokemon to (92:22 - 92:26)
have psychic type (92:24 - 92:28)
uh dell fox and its pre-evolved form (92:26 - 92:30)
share the category with vulpix nine (92:28 - 92:32)
tails nikkit and thievel (92:30 - 92:34)
they are all known as the fox pokemon is (92:32 - 92:36)
your trivia (92:34 - 92:39)
all right pokemon for this week i don't (92:36 - 92:40)
know (92:39 - 92:43)
[Laughter] (92:40 - 92:46)
all right let me go let me go the (92:43 - 92:48)
tradition of exchanging cards on saint (92:46 - 92:50)
valentine's day has its origins (92:48 - 92:52)
somewhere in medieval times but really (92:50 - 92:54)
took off in 1913 (92:52 - 92:56)
when hallmark cards of kansas city (92:54 - 92:58)
missouri began mass production of (92:56 - 93:01)
valentines honestly if we are ever (92:58 - 93:03)
concerned with the over (93:01 - 93:05)
commercialization of any holiday (93:03 - 93:07)
the dark specter of hallmark can (93:05 - 93:08)
typically be found lurking in the (93:07 - 93:10)
shadows (93:08 - 93:13)
our pokemon this week lost three grams (93:10 - 93:16)
on route 13 in univa between (93:13 - 93:19)
lacunosa and andella towns and adjacent (93:16 - 93:20)
to the giant (93:19 - 93:23)
chasm you cannot catch the pokemon (93:20 - 93:25)
that drops the three grams even after (93:23 - 93:28)
you track down and return all three (93:25 - 93:30)
but it will give you tm 89 as a thank (93:28 - 93:31)
you (93:30 - 93:34)
before it flies away this is the only (93:31 - 93:36)
way an original pokemon black and white (93:34 - 93:40)
to obtain the tm for u-turn (93:36 - 93:43)
fans of pokemon mystery dungeon at the (93:40 - 93:45)
very least the rescue team versions (93:43 - 93:48)
may be a bit confused in those games (93:45 - 93:51)
it is this pokemon's evolution that (93:48 - 93:53)
provides the mail delivery service (93:51 - 93:55)
there you go not too hard not not too (93:53 - 93:56)
hard this week (93:55 - 93:59)
okay we'll be back next week well (93:56 - 94:01)
