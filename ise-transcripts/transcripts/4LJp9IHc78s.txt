during the 80s EA (0:57 - 1:03)
was my favorite game publisher during (0:59 - 1:05)
the 2017 I don't think they have a (1:03 - 1:08)
single game I'm interested in what (1:05 - 1:11)
happened to Electronic Arts (1:08 - 1:13)
they they they only care about their (1:11 - 1:16)
influencers gotta have all the (1:13 - 1:20)

first ever real-world Pokemon go event I (5:09 - 5:14)
want to point out they said first-ever (5:12 - 5:15)
which means there's probably going to be (5:14 - 5:17)
more to come after this coming your way (5:15 - 5:20)
Pokemon go fest Chicago this event will (5:17 - 5:22)
take place in downtown Chicago Illinois (5:20 - 5:26)
USA at the beautiful Grant Park on July (5:22 - 5:29)
22nd 2017 I'm gonna stop right there is (5:26 - 5:32)
Grant Park where the beam is is that the (5:29 - 5:35)
beam I've been to Chicago one for like (5:32 - 5:38)
12 hours total in my entire life what's (5:35 - 5:39)
the beam now I know what the beam is (5:38 - 5:41)
please listeners don't write in I've (5:39 - 5:44)
seen had no interest in the beam okay (5:41 - 5:45)
it's a mirror (5:44 - 5:49)
I ate a fine house mirror AT&T paid for (5:45 - 5:49)
the beam (5:49 - 5:53)
I have AT&T they should have instead of (5:49 - 5:55)
buying a giant beam they should have put (5:53 - 5:57)
up a cell tower down there because the (5:55 - 6:01)
AT&T service is kind of atrocious is it (5:57 - 6:03)
really it's fine great T and T as well (6:01 - 6:07)
I've had a bad it was singular I think (6:03 - 6:09)
Grand Park Grant Park is is the beam (6:07 - 6:13)
pulling up here yeah Grant Park is next (6:09 - 6:18)
to Butler field it is also part of the (6:13 - 6:20)
beam the beam is called Cloud Gate I (6:18 - 6:23)
think is that right no why are you (6:20 - 6:25)
asking you I can't find a beam the beam (6:23 - 6:29)
is called Cloud Gate the mirrored beam (6:25 - 6:33)
shape sculpture in Grant Park it has the (6:29 - 6:36)
the pavilion where they have done music (6:33 - 6:38)
concerts before it has an ice-skating (6:36 - 6:42)
Club it has a Chicago tour area it has a (6:38 - 6:46)
Segway tour area it is next to the Art (6:42 - 6:49)
Institute of Chicago alright so the (6:46 - 6:51)
beans at Millennium Park stop with your (6:49 - 6:53)
confusion Asst okay but Millennium Park (6:51 - 6:56)
is across the street from Grant Park (6:53 - 6:58)
well that may still makes them two (6:56 - 7:01)
separate places but the Grant Park music (6:58 - 7:04)
where the pavilion is is in Millennium (7:01 - 7:04)
Park (7:04 - 7:07)
I wonder if okay let me just finish the (7:04 - 7:09)
article here all right all right all (7:07 - 7:10)
right I just looked at a map and you're (7:09 - 7:10)
right (7:10 - 7:14)
you are correct one for me well we'll (7:10 - 7:16)
take place at Grant Park on July 22nd (7:14 - 7:19)
join us as we celebrate Pokemon go the (7:16 - 7:22)
Pokemon go community with a ton a ton of (7:19 - 7:24)
exciting festivities tickets and more (7:22 - 7:26)

european trainers can look forward to (7:37 - 7:42)
pokemon go celebrations hosted across (7:40 - 7:43)
the continent from June through (7:42 - 7:47)
September in a partnership with you you (7:43 - 7:51)
bail rod mokou shopping centers you (7:47 - 7:52)
probably got you guys know what that is (7:51 - 7:55)
I'm assuming we'll be posting a complete (7:52 - 7:57)
schedule of these events very soon also (7:55 - 7:59)
the Pokemon company is organizing (7:57 - 8:01)
Pikachu outbreak we reported it on this (7:59 - 8:04)
two episodes ago a Pokemon event in (8:01 - 8:07)
Yokohama Japan in August where they're (8:04 - 8:10)
exploring a unique Pokemon go experience (8:07 - 8:12)
stay tuned for more details surrounding (8:10 - 8:14)
each of these events in the coming week (8:12 - 8:17)
so we got a couple things here I think (8:14 - 8:19)
the fire and ice type event we don't (8:17 - 8:20)
have to spend much time on we're just (8:19 - 8:22)
gonna see more fire pokemon more ice (8:20 - 8:24)
type pokemon you're gonna get an XP (8:22 - 8:26)
boost when you're throwing pokeballs (8:24 - 8:27)
accurately I'm assuming that's the (8:26 - 8:30)
accurately would be the spinning motion (8:27 - 8:32)
that you can do the curveball discount (8:30 - 8:34)
in lucky eggs in the game shop so if (8:32 - 8:36)
you're planning on playing Pokemon go (8:34 - 8:38)
all summer you might want to stock up on (8:36 - 8:39)
those (8:38 - 8:41)
what do lucky eggs get you in Pokemon go (8:39 - 8:44)
they give you a 30 minutes XP boost I (8:41 - 8:46)
think the big takeaway from this though (8:44 - 8:48)
is they're gonna be they're gonna be (8:46 - 8:50)
disabling gyms for a short period of (8:48 - 8:53)
time that's all gyms Yantic did come out (8:50 - 8:56)
on reddit and say that your Pokemon at (8:53 - 8:58)
the gyms will be returned to you so all (8:56 - 9:02)
gyms will be empty after the gym update (8:58 - 9:03)
happens there's no word on what the gym (9:02 - 9:07)
update is going to be but they do say (9:03 - 9:10)
before that there will be a (9:07 - 9:12)
collaborative group gameplay feature (9:10 - 9:14)
that will get you playing Pokemon go and (9:12 - 9:15)
fun new (9:14 - 9:17)
ways I wonder if they're kind of doing (9:15 - 9:19)
something with when they showed in the (9:17 - 9:20)
original trailer I don't know if you (9:19 - 9:21)
remember that where everyone was in (9:20 - 9:24)
Times Square catching Mewtwo I do (9:21 - 9:26)
remember that I wonder if it's gonna be (9:24 - 9:28)
something like that hmm (9:26 - 9:30)
I mean it will be something like that (9:28 - 9:32)
but like is a very broad and right (9:30 - 9:35)
Pacific word because you can help (9:32 - 9:37)
somebody else taking a gym that's (9:35 - 9:39)
already there's already some (9:37 - 9:42)
collaboration there in in that aspect (9:39 - 9:44)
how do you feel about this Pokemon go (9:42 - 9:47)
event I feel I feel like the Internet is (9:44 - 9:52)
very upset that it's one city and they (9:47 - 9:54)
may be upset if they live in like (9:52 - 9:56)
California or New York and Chicago is (9:54 - 9:58)
not a very easy place to get to and (9:56 - 10:00)
maybe that's why I am so excited because (9:58 - 10:01)
I am only an hour away (10:00 - 10:04)
I mean Chicago's not that hard to get to (10:01 - 10:07)
they've got two airports but my concern (10:04 - 10:10)
is I mean there there's a common ship to (10:07 - 10:12)
the tickets cost no price Oh the tickets (10:10 - 10:16)
are free no no they haven't said ah see (10:12 - 10:18)
now the problem is right what if it's (10:16 - 10:21)
like an exclusive Pokemon and I have to (10:18 - 10:24)
explain to my nephew that he'll never (10:21 - 10:28)
have like Mewtwo because not only could (10:24 - 10:29)
we not afford the airfare to go to (10:28 - 10:31)
Chicago we couldn't afford the $50.00 (10:29 - 10:34)
for two tickets to Pokemon go festival (10:31 - 10:36)
right and they don't they haven't (10:34 - 10:37)
implemented trading yet as far as I'm (10:36 - 10:41)
aware that's true so I have a I have a (10:37 - 10:42)
couple thoughts about that so you make (10:41 - 10:44)
an excellent point right if I'm in (10:42 - 10:48)
California and I and Nene antic already (10:44 - 10:50)
has said that there will be there will (10:48 - 10:52)
be legendary Pokemon this summer we (10:50 - 10:54)
don't know if that's one we don't know (10:52 - 10:56)
if that's two we don't know we just know (10:54 - 10:58)
that we're supposed to at least get one (10:56 - 11:01)
legendary Pokemon this summer I kind of (10:58 - 11:03)
was under the mindset why would they do (11:01 - 11:07)
the first legendary Pokemon in one city (11:03 - 11:09)
behind a paywall (11:07 - 11:13)
because if you look at past events at (11:09 - 11:17)
Grant Park that Park has a limit cap of (11:13 - 11:21)
12,000 people which is a lot it is a lot (11:17 - 11:23)
that's a lot that's it's a big park (11:21 - 11:27)
if not only can only 12,000 people go to (11:23 - 11:29)
this or maybe less depending (11:27 - 11:31)
what the festivities are they haven't (11:29 - 11:32)
said what's what what's actually going (11:31 - 11:34)
to happen here there there's a paywall (11:32 - 11:37)
to get in whether that's $20 or $40 or (11:34 - 11:39)
who knows how much it's gonna cost to (11:37 - 11:40)
get in they'll probably do the the (11:39 - 11:42)
standard Pokemon thing they always do (11:40 - 11:44)
where it's like yeah it's $40 to get in (11:42 - 11:45)
but we're gonna give you a t-shirt and (11:44 - 11:48)
here's three booster packs and I can't (11:45 - 11:51)
imagine that I can't imagine tcpi isn't (11:48 - 11:53)
very directly evolved into this even (11:51 - 11:56)
though it's neon takes event but tcp/ip (11:53 - 11:59)
is very controlling its neon takes event (11:56 - 12:02)
so a yeah but they can't force them to (11:59 - 12:03)
give stuff away they can't they can't (12:02 - 12:05)
influence the profit margin here but (12:03 - 12:08)
whatever go I could or they they could (12:05 - 12:09)
they could say hey we're gonna we're (12:08 - 12:11)
gonna make the shirts but Bob if it that (12:09 - 12:15)
that doesn't matter your point of what (12:11 - 12:18)
if they do do a legendary pokemon here I (12:15 - 12:20)
think I think everyone would be not (12:18 - 12:22)
everyone I think the people at the event (12:20 - 12:23)
would be very excited and very happy (12:22 - 12:26)
everyone else would be very upset but at (12:23 - 12:29)
the same time I can't get far fetched (12:26 - 12:30)
without traveling to another country (12:29 - 12:33)
this is true I can't get mr. mime (12:30 - 12:34)
without going to Europe I can't get (12:33 - 12:36)
kangaskhan without going to Australia (12:34 - 12:39)
once that's put in perspective I can (12:36 - 12:42)
totally see them going all right here's (12:39 - 12:45)
the Aptos it's only in Chicago only at (12:42 - 12:48)
this event no I I can see that I agree I (12:45 - 12:50)
just I think a lot of people it's like (12:48 - 12:52)
it's kind of like you you you put a (12:50 - 12:54)
little crack into the armor and then (12:52 - 12:56)
that's what people are gonna chisel away (12:54 - 12:58)
at to kind of break in and it's like mmm (12:56 - 13:01)
right even though yes everybody's aware (12:58 - 13:04)
mr. mime is only in Europe and you know (13:01 - 13:06)
that far fetch is only in Japan or (13:04 - 13:09)
whatever like that doesn't have that (13:06 - 13:12)
additional little piece of the paywall (13:09 - 13:14)
love having to have a ticket and it's (13:12 - 13:17)
like almost like well I could have done (13:14 - 13:20)
this but you put it out of my reach not (13:17 - 13:23)
in a game play kind of fashion but like (13:20 - 13:27)
in a real world dollars fashion so I (13:23 - 13:28)
mean that's where I can see people (13:27 - 13:31)
getting annoyed again I do I I'm not on (13:28 - 13:32)
either side of the fence like I can (13:31 - 13:34)
totally see them doing this I can (13:32 - 13:36)
totally see them not doing this but I (13:34 - 13:38)
feel like they would do this just based (13:36 - 13:42)
on these region-specific Pokemon on top (13:38 - 13:44)
of if they're actually releasing (13:42 - 13:47)
legendary Pokemon like let's say Mewtwo (13:44 - 13:50)
is at Chicago everyone there I I don't (13:47 - 13:52)
even know how the caching aspect works (13:50 - 13:54)
like just just Mewtwo running away from (13:52 - 13:56)
some people just does everyone catch (13:54 - 13:59)
them how let's just say that the 12,000 (13:56 - 14:01)
people that are there they all walk away (13:59 - 14:03)
with Mewtwo mu-2 would actually probably (14:01 - 14:08)
be one of the rarest Pokemon in Pokemon (14:03 - 14:12)
go whereas if they put Mewtwo at every (14:08 - 14:16)
McDonald's for just a Saturday you would (14:12 - 14:18)
then be saying that far fetch or (14:16 - 14:20)
Kangaskhan or mr. mime you would be (14:18 - 14:22)
saying that those Pokemon are rarer than (14:20 - 14:25)
your legendary now I agree with that and (14:22 - 14:27)
I was you know I'm thinking that it's (14:25 - 14:30)
kind of like how the original mute (14:27 - 14:32)
distribution happened where you know you (14:30 - 14:34)
had to go to a specific place and hope (14:32 - 14:36)
that they still had Musa vailable to (14:34 - 14:38)
distribute I mean there wasn't a cost (14:36 - 14:40)
involved but it certainly you know (14:38 - 14:43)
required more than your typical Pokemon (14:40 - 14:47)
collecting effort in order to accomplish (14:43 - 14:49)
it but my one thing like the when I've (14:47 - 14:50)
been thinking about this the one thing (14:49 - 14:53)
that I kind of frame it in my head that (14:50 - 14:56)
I think might be acceptable is similar (14:53 - 15:00)
to back when destiny was first launching (14:56 - 15:03)
and I think it was PAX West they had (15:00 - 15:05)
like if you were at PAX West you could (15:03 - 15:08)
get the black Smith armor yes English (15:05 - 15:11)
yeah the shader and like that was the (15:08 - 15:13)
only way you could get the shader but (15:11 - 15:14)
then like a year later they're like oh (15:13 - 15:16)
here everybody can have the black Smith (15:14 - 15:19)
shader so it's like it was special for a (15:16 - 15:21)
period of time but then they just made (15:19 - 15:23)
it more generally available I said and I (15:21 - 15:25)
think that's okay I think that's yeah I (15:23 - 15:26)
think that's okay too (15:25 - 15:28)
I mean you're buying your six months of (15:26 - 15:31)
I have Mewtwo and nobody else does and I (15:28 - 15:33)
mean you also get to bunt hang out with (15:31 - 15:35)
a bunch of Pokemon go playing nerds (15:33 - 15:38)
yeah Chicago the worst city on earth I I (15:35 - 15:40)
will I will be there I I plan on buying (15:38 - 15:43)
tickets I plan on I'm being there I'm (15:40 - 15:44)
assuming tickets are gonna sell very (15:43 - 15:46)
fast I'm not sure how much they're gonna (15:44 - 15:47)
cost my guess is they're gonna be 40 (15:46 - 15:50)
that would be that would be my guess (15:47 - 15:52)
free no I don't I don't think free at (15:50 - 15:56)
all did you say 40 40 40 f40 that would (15:52 - 15:59)
before hmm too much do you think so yeah (15:56 - 16:01)
now it's got to be 25 to 30 I would say (15:59 - 16:03)
40 but you're getting something you're (16:01 - 16:05)
getting like a swag bag when you walk in (16:03 - 16:08)
that would be a swag bag with a fidget (16:05 - 16:11)
spinner in it I mean these people they (16:08 - 16:13)
got to make money this is this is like (16:11 - 16:17)
West Coast elites thinking like looking (16:13 - 16:19)
down on Mid America and they're like oh (16:17 - 16:20)
we're gonna take these people for all (16:19 - 16:23)
their cash and make $30 off a profit off (16:20 - 16:23)
of it (16:23 - 16:27)
a $10 ticket I have no faith in Niantic (16:23 - 16:30)
stability to not be greedy but my guess (16:27 - 16:31)
would be that they're gonna do the (16:30 - 16:35)
Chicago event there I the more I think (16:31 - 16:38)
about the fact that there are regions (16:35 - 16:40)
specific Pokemon the more I am (16:38 - 16:43)
convincing myself that they're gonna do (16:40 - 16:45)
a legendary here it just doesn't make (16:43 - 16:48)
sense to make your legendary easier to (16:45 - 16:50)
get than a far-fetched it just let me (16:48 - 16:53)
ask you this how would you feel if they (16:50 - 16:55)
don't do a legendary because they're (16:53 - 16:57)
gonna save that for some worldwide event (16:55 - 17:00)
on their anniversary this doesn't happen (16:57 - 17:02)
on the anniversary does it this is this (17:00 - 17:03)
is the anniversary yeah this is their (17:02 - 17:05)
one okay hmm (17:03 - 17:06)
I was I was and say what if they don't (17:05 - 17:08)
do a legendary and instead they make any (17:06 - 17:11)
Pokemon that are not typically available (17:08 - 17:14)
in that region available in that (17:11 - 17:16)
location on that time so yeah I wanted (17:14 - 17:19)
to talk about that excellent transition (17:16 - 17:22)
will if you look at the Pokemon go fest (17:19 - 17:25)
picture I would I would assume that a (17:22 - 17:27)
intern didn't make the graphic for this (17:25 - 17:30)
image because there's very specific (17:27 - 17:31)
things that are happening in the Pokemon (17:30 - 17:33)
and in the image itself so you see (17:31 - 17:35)
Charizard you see Venus or you see (17:33 - 17:37)
Blastoise you have your Pikachu of (17:35 - 17:40)
Butterfree you have Snorlax and then on (17:37 - 17:42)
top of Snorlax you have larvae tar and (17:40 - 17:48)
then behind larvae tar you see a merrill (17:42 - 17:52)
and a togepi and then above Blastoise (17:48 - 17:55)
you see an unknown and then if you look (17:52 - 17:57)
behind Charizard and there's a bunch of (17:55 - 18:00)
polka stops - you see hair across hair (17:57 - 18:03)
across is a region specific Pokemon you (18:00 - 18:05)
cannot get hair across in America so why (18:03 - 18:08)
would they put hair across in this image (18:05 - 18:10)
in (18:08 - 18:12)
Chicago because obviously in the (18:10 - 18:14)
background of this image is is what's (18:12 - 18:16)
supposed to look like Chicago why would (18:14 - 18:20)
they do that unless they're putting (18:16 - 18:22)
regions but they're letting the people (18:20 - 18:24)
who come to Chicago for this event get a (18:22 - 18:27)
chance to get Kangaskhan and and mr. (18:24 - 18:29)
mime and heracross and stuff like that (18:27 - 18:32)
or maybe they just did it because (18:29 - 18:35)
heracross is a really popular Gentoo (18:32 - 18:37)
pokemon no I can't imagine they did it (18:35 - 18:40)
because of that I feel like this is so I (18:37 - 18:42)
feel like this is really they're teasing (18:40 - 18:45)
something here so it okay let me back up (18:42 - 18:47)
if they do a legendary Pokemon at (18:45 - 18:49)
Chicago cool I'm not going to be upset (18:47 - 18:51)
even if I wasn't going I wouldn't be (18:49 - 18:53)
upset because I think the legendary (18:51 - 18:56)
Pokemon need to be rarer than the region (18:53 - 18:58)
specific Pokemon and so if they do do it (18:56 - 19:00)
I get it I understand it and I totally (18:58 - 19:02)
get that people will be upset about that (19:00 - 19:06)
if they do not do it again I don't (19:02 - 19:08)
really care they're eventually gonna do (19:06 - 19:09)
it I'm sure they're gonna make it (19:08 - 19:12)
difficult or or it's it's not like (19:09 - 19:13)
Mewtwo's just gonna spawn in your (19:12 - 19:15)
backyard I'm assuming that you have to (19:13 - 19:17)
physically go somewhere to do it whether (19:15 - 19:19)
that's gonna be we're gonna do me to a (19:17 - 19:21)
tall target so we're gonna do me two at (19:19 - 19:23)
Starbucks Azure or Walmart's there's (19:21 - 19:26)
going to be some sort of travel slash (19:23 - 19:30)
event holding it if they do regional (19:26 - 19:33)
Pokemon if they say hey at the Chicago (19:30 - 19:34)
vet we're gonna do heracross and we're (19:33 - 19:36)
gonna do far fetch and we're gonna do (19:34 - 19:38)
kangaskhan I might actually like that (19:36 - 19:41)
better because I have zero plans to (19:38 - 19:43)
travel like maybe in the next year or (19:41 - 19:46)
two I will go to Japan but there's no (19:43 - 19:48)
way in the next year or two I'm gonna go (19:46 - 19:50)
to Europe Japan and Australia especially (19:48 - 19:53)
just to get one Pokemon in Pokemon go (19:50 - 19:56)
and I saw that some people were kind of (19:53 - 19:58)
like no they shouldn't do that region (19:56 - 20:00)
Pokemon should be region specific why (19:58 - 20:02)
not have them at the Chicago event once (20:00 - 20:04)
they introduced trading none of that (20:02 - 20:07)
matters like when I was at PAX in (20:04 - 20:08)
Seattle last year I met these amazing (20:07 - 20:11)
people from Australia and if they were (20:08 - 20:13)
playing Pokemon go I'm sure they would (20:11 - 20:15)
have enough Kangaskhan to give me and I (20:13 - 20:17)
could easily give them a tourist like (20:15 - 20:19)
that situation is slowly going to start (20:17 - 20:21)
to close itself like yeah it's going to (20:19 - 20:23)
be still hard to get a kangaskhan (20:21 - 20:24)
because you're gonna have to meet (20:23 - 20:25)
somebody that goes to Australia but I (20:24 - 20:27)
think that's and you have to meet them (20:25 - 20:30)
in person because I believe the the (20:27 - 20:32)
rumor was trading has to be person to (20:30 - 20:35)
person or like in person to in person (20:32 - 20:37)
but the hair cross has to mean something (20:35 - 20:40)
it has I can't I can't imagine out of (20:37 - 20:44)
the 240 some Pokemon 230 some Pokemon (20:40 - 20:46)
that are available in Pokemon go they (20:44 - 20:48)
would make that mistake of Oh actually (20:46 - 20:51)
hair cross isn't in America just stop (20:48 - 20:53)
trying to national treasure this one (20:51 - 20:56)
picture your let's let's go even deeper (20:53 - 20:58)
well Nicolas Cage let's go even deeper (20:56 - 21:01)
so above hair across is another unknown (20:58 - 21:03)
I don't have the sources in front of me (21:01 - 21:06)
but I'm pretty sure unknown is the (21:03 - 21:09)
hardest Pokemon defying in Pokemon go it (21:06 - 21:11)
has the high the lowest spawn rate or (21:09 - 21:12)
whatever (21:11 - 21:14)
so if you see unknown it's the rarest (21:12 - 21:16)
and I'm pretty sure Tyranitar is the (21:14 - 21:18)
second hardest Pokemon to find in (21:16 - 21:20)
Pokemon go which was why I think it's (21:18 - 21:22)
interesting that they show a larva tar (21:20 - 21:24)
on top of Snorlax but that's just going (21:22 - 21:26)
down another rabbit hole so the unknown (21:24 - 21:33)
above heracross is the exclamation mark (21:26 - 21:37)
unknown which will I bet you know that (21:33 - 21:39)
was introduced in Gen 3 I didn't know (21:37 - 21:41)
that the expo mate I actually didn't (21:39 - 21:44)
know that until we could go because you (21:41 - 21:45)
know unknown is not on the front of my (21:44 - 21:49)
mind all the time the exclamation mark (21:45 - 21:51)
unknown and the question mark unknown (21:49 - 21:54)
were introduced in Gen 3 so where where (21:51 - 21:55)
are you seeing this image because I'm (21:54 - 21:59)
looking at an image on the specific site (21:55 - 22:02)
and I do not see any you know Ann's oh I (21:59 - 22:04)
see the hair cross okay it's right above (22:02 - 22:07)
the hair cross it's really faint yeah (22:04 - 22:09)
it's like almost like we're trying to (22:07 - 22:12)
hide almost like that it's there they're (22:09 - 22:14)
teasing something it's almost like (22:12 - 22:16)
they're teasing something my guess would (22:14 - 22:19)
be that the Chicago event will have the (22:16 - 22:22)
first legendary and the Chicago event (22:19 - 22:24)
and/or the Chicago event will have (22:22 - 22:28)
region specific Pokemon and then my (22:24 - 22:31)
guess is come this fall they're going to (22:28 - 22:34)
release gen 3 so after they fix the gyms (22:31 - 22:36)
and I'm assuming they're gonna do (22:34 - 22:37)
trading but (22:36 - 22:41)
between that and and gen3 all we can do (22:37 - 22:42)
is assume and speculate yeah till it (22:41 - 22:44)
actually happens and it's fun and it's (22:42 - 22:46)
an and we'll probably be wrong and (22:44 - 22:46)
that's okay (22:46 - 22:49)
but hey we we talked about it at least (22:46 - 22:51)
so well we'll have more details soon (22:49 - 22:55)
this event isn't until July 22nd tickets (22:51 - 22:57)
go on sale we'll have one more podcast (22:55 - 22:59)
before tickets at least one more podcast (22:57 - 23:02)
before tickets go on sale so oh and then (22:59 - 23:04)
we'll have like four weeks after tickets (23:02 - 23:05)
go on sale to continue to talk about (23:04 - 23:08)
this but we'll do that when the when the (23:05 - 23:12)
time comes Apple had a keynote this week (23:08 - 23:15)
the only reason I bring up this is Apple (23:12 - 23:19)
had their WWDC keynote they talked about (23:15 - 23:23)
Pokemon go slightly and then they kind (23:19 - 23:25)
of went in and talked about their AR kit (23:23 - 23:27)
which is the augmented reality platform (23:25 - 23:32)
that Pokemon go uses this is off (23:27 - 23:33)
polygons I just want to read a little (23:32 - 23:34)
bit of this we don't have to spend much (23:33 - 23:36)
time talking about this I just think (23:34 - 23:39)
this is interesting in Pokemon gos (23:36 - 23:42)
viewpoint when Pokemon go launched last (23:39 - 23:43)
year on Android and iOS it (23:42 - 23:45)
revolutionized the way people think (23:43 - 23:47)
about games on a phone Pokemon go became (23:45 - 23:49)
a craze that didn't die down until later (23:47 - 23:52)
that fall for many it was a look into (23:49 - 23:55)
the power of AR technology that could do (23:52 - 23:57)
for an average smartphone user first for (23:55 - 23:58)
Apple it was the first piece of software (23:57 - 24:01)
that the company saw a profitable means (23:58 - 24:03)
of development and helped to reinforce (24:01 - 24:05)
the entire sector of the company during (24:03 - 24:08)
the 2016 investor call Apple CEO Tim (24:05 - 24:10)
Cook was asked about the success of (24:08 - 24:13)
Pokemon go Cook said by the third week (24:10 - 24:15)
of July the game had more downloads than (24:13 - 24:17)
any other app in the company's history (24:15 - 24:21)
according to Apple Cook said that it was (24:17 - 24:23)
a promising statistic and proved that AR (24:21 - 24:27)
can be really great quote we have been (24:23 - 24:29)
and continued to invest in AR in the (24:27 - 24:31)
long run Cook said we'll we'll see (24:29 - 24:34)
whether it's the next computing platform (24:31 - 24:37)
but regardless it will be huge during (24:34 - 24:40)
the most recent during WWDC presentation (24:37 - 24:43)
Apple showed off a number of ways AR kit (24:40 - 24:44)
can be used in applications and games (24:43 - 24:46)
that we'll run through it front and (24:44 - 24:48)
center was a better version of Pokemon (24:46 - 24:51)
go that will remain exclusive to the (24:48 - 24:53)
i phone paired with Apple's newest iOS (24:51 - 24:56)
iOS 11 they then showed some other games (24:53 - 24:59)
regarding Lord of the Rings director (24:56 - 25:01)
Peter Jackson studio blah blah blah and (24:59 - 25:04)
yes they go more in depth about AR but (25:01 - 25:08)
if you are an iOS Pokemon go player the (25:04 - 25:11)
AR experience will be much better as (25:08 - 25:13)
soon as iOS 11 comes out which is (25:11 - 25:15)
scheduled this fall why are they making (25:13 - 25:19)
me wait so long I mean don't most people (25:15 - 25:21)
just turn off the AR part yeah cuz it (25:19 - 25:23)
makes it harder to catch pokemon it's (25:21 - 25:25)
well that and it destroys your battery (25:23 - 25:27)
it uses so much battery power when it's (25:25 - 25:30)
on which which but you use the iPhone (25:27 - 25:32)
with the small battery yeah I have the (25:30 - 25:34)
tiny iPhone alright what I don't I mean (25:32 - 25:36)
I have the big iPhone so I have no (25:34 - 25:38)
battery concern to the big iPhone one (25:36 - 25:39)
more news article here before we get to (25:38 - 25:41)

comicbook.com Magikarp jump released its (25:45 - 25:50)
first big update today which added a (25:48 - 25:52)
surprising amount of new content than (25:50 - 25:54)
the game in addition to raising the (25:52 - 25:56)
maximum player and Magikarp levels (25:54 - 25:59)
Magikarp jump also added the heal League (25:56 - 26:01)
as a new place for players to test their (25:59 - 26:03)
magic carpet jumping ability after (26:01 - 26:05)

and apricot skin colors in addition to (26:07 - 26:13)
new support Pokemon were added to the (26:11 - 26:15)
game greninja will give your Magikarp a (26:13 - 26:17)
massive amount of JP which is jump power (26:15 - 26:19)

types of high-level training and that's (26:34 - 26:40)
it's pretty much it you still play you (26:37 - 26:43)
still play in the jump I mean typically (26:40 - 26:46)
I only play when we record on Sundays so (26:43 - 26:49)
I mean we already recordings are that (26:46 - 26:52)
boring that you need I mean well it says (26:49 - 26:54)
more about Magikarp jump that you know (26:52 - 26:57)
it doesn't take that much thought so (26:54 - 26:59)
it's like you're just kind of poking at (26:57 - 27:01)
the screen there's not a lot of (26:59 - 27:04)
decisions to me I did lose a Magikarp (27:01 - 27:04)
too (27:04 - 27:08)
Pidgeot and that was disappointing but (27:04 - 27:11)
now it just doesn't hold my interest (27:08 - 27:13)
I've got you like I'm playing Pokemon (27:11 - 27:15)
son I'm still playing Monster Hunter I'm (27:13 - 27:17)
doing a little crochet project here and (27:15 - 27:19)
there I got lots of stuff to fill my (27:17 - 27:21)
time I don't know if are you still (27:19 - 27:22)
playing shuffle nope (27:21 - 27:25)
are you still playing Rumble world no (27:22 - 27:28)
and I don't I can't play pick cross (27:25 - 27:31)
anymore either because the final puzzles (27:28 - 27:33)
that I have left take too long and it's (27:31 - 27:34)
just like an amount of time that I don't (27:33 - 27:37)
have to available to set aside doing a (27:34 - 27:39)
big cross puzzle but you played those (27:37 - 27:43)
slow and steady for months very much (27:39 - 27:46)
like I play monster hunter now one (27:43 - 27:48)
monster to kill every day I feel like (27:46 - 27:51)
Magikarp jump is fits your criteria of (27:48 - 27:55)
it's free its Pokemon you can play it (27:51 - 27:56)
for a long time and I'll put money into (27:55 - 27:59)
it you can do it for example every (27:56 - 28:01)

dark cry and stuff that wasn't in the (29:37 - 29:41)
Wii U version remember when we got that (29:39 - 29:43)
really angry email that we were wrong (29:41 - 29:47)
that all the arcade Pokemon were on the (29:43 - 29:49)
Wii U disc and we were it was (29:47 - 29:52)
unbelievable that they would remake it (29:49 - 29:54)
for switch it doesn't matter that there (29:52 - 29:55)
on the disc (29:54 - 29:58)
they're not gonna unlock them yep no I (29:55 - 30:01)
agree well I mean it happened of course (29:58 - 30:04)

start of the game pokken tournament DX (30:40 - 30:44)
will launch on attendance which (30:43 - 30:48)
September 22nd 2017 so let's stop there (30:44 - 30:50)
let's worry about the other news later (30:48 - 30:52)
this was an 8 minute (30:50 - 30:56)
direct 5 of those minutes 6 of those (30:52 - 30:59)
minutes were dedicated to this game yeah (30:56 - 31:03)
this is not a new tactic by Pokemon no (30:59 - 31:06)
no I do want to point out though that (31:03 - 31:09)
all the games they showed none of them (31:06 - 31:11)
were new they were all just enhanced (31:09 - 31:15)
versions or old versions of games that (31:11 - 31:18)
have existed yeah I mean the point of (31:15 - 31:22)
the poke in the portion of it that (31:18 - 31:24)
featured it was a discussion of pokin or (31:22 - 31:27)
sort of a I don't know display what do (31:24 - 31:29)
you want to call that the ad for pokken (31:27 - 31:30)
was the (31:29 - 31:32)
fact that the dude was like traveling (31:30 - 31:33)
through all of these different (31:32 - 31:35)
situations and he was able to play (31:33 - 31:38)
pokken in whatever situation he was in (31:35 - 31:40)
it's all just lie down it's almost like (31:38 - 31:43)
the nitendo switch is like a handheld (31:40 - 31:46)
console kind of it's almost like they (31:43 - 31:49)
tried to tell that story and they have (31:46 - 31:51)
been telling that story in every single (31:49 - 31:54)
switch commercial no one's playing at (31:51 - 31:54)
home (31:54 - 31:56)
I don't want again I don't get my ahead (31:54 - 31:58)
of myself but you're this guy plays (31:56 - 32:02)
pokken everywhere outside he plays at a (31:58 - 32:04)
restaurant he plays at a broken train he (32:02 - 32:06)
plays in a park and then when he gets to (32:04 - 32:09)
his house you see people playing a 3ds (32:06 - 32:11)
inside their home shouldn't it be the (32:09 - 32:14)
other way around if Linda temple (32:11 - 32:15)
switches this home console shouldn't (32:14 - 32:17)
they be playing at home and the people (32:15 - 32:19)
with the DS's should be outside I just (32:17 - 32:20)
thought it was wrong I just thought that (32:19 - 32:23)
was funny the big boys play the switch (32:20 - 32:26)
the little boys play the three oh I see (32:23 - 32:28)
that's what that's what that was that (32:26 - 32:32)
was the story I am NOT planning on (32:28 - 32:35)
buying pokken for the switch well no (32:32 - 32:37)
because I could beat you at pokken for (32:35 - 32:40)
the WiiU and that would continue and you (32:37 - 32:41)
will not play any game that I can beat (32:40 - 32:43)
you it will retired me from poked and (32:41 - 32:46)
tournament exactly I'm not big on (32:43 - 32:47)
fighting games (32:46 - 32:51)
I think pokin is is cool I think there (32:47 - 32:53)
are better fighting games if I was to (32:51 - 32:55)
play a fighting game pokken has the (32:53 - 32:57)
appeal of Pokemon but there are other (32:55 - 32:59)
fighting games that I have enjoyed more (32:57 - 33:01)
in the past like like Soul Calibur for (32:59 - 33:03)
example I think it makes a lot of sense (33:01 - 33:05)
that they're making this game again (33:03 - 33:08)
since it didn't have an opportunity to (33:05 - 33:12)
really shine on Wii U and I think we're (33:08 - 33:13)
gonna see this with more games I would (33:12 - 33:16)
not be surprised at e3 if we see Super (33:13 - 33:19)
Smash Brothers DX just like we saw Mario (33:16 - 33:23)
Kart DX or deluxe Oh 100% like the last (33:19 - 33:26)
like 1.5 years of the Wii U is just (33:23 - 33:27)
going to be replicated on the switch (33:26 - 33:30)
right heck we're gonna get what's the (33:27 - 33:31)
witch game (33:30 - 33:33)
Bayonetta we're gonna get paying at a (33:31 - 33:35)
switch I think so yeah I think so too (33:33 - 33:38)
and I think that's fine those games were (33:35 - 33:39)
made they didn't sell as well as they (33:38 - 33:41)
could because of the hardware it was on (33:39 - 33:43)
I think that's all fine and that's why (33:41 - 33:44)
we were so confident (33:43 - 33:47)
that those old characters in pokken (33:44 - 33:48)
weren't going to come because they're (33:47 - 33:49)
putting their efforts through here I (33:48 - 33:52)
think what this speaks more of though is (33:49 - 33:55)
the Nintendo's switch competitive (33:52 - 33:57)
viewpoint that they're really pushing if (33:55 - 34:00)
you look at splatoon and you look at (33:57 - 34:02)
arms and now you look at pokin these are (34:00 - 34:05)
all extremely competitive games that (34:02 - 34:07)
they are pushing all summer and I think (34:05 - 34:10)
that's interesting none of those games I (34:07 - 34:13)
am a fan of I think if I was the pick (34:10 - 34:14)
out of the three (34:13 - 34:16)
splatoon would be the one that would (34:14 - 34:20)
most garnish my attention even with all (34:16 - 34:20)
these new features (34:20 - 34:26)
I played 30 or so hours of pokin and I (34:20 - 34:29)
feel like I got my my fill of that game (34:26 - 34:31)
well and I mean yeah I mean splatoon for (34:29 - 34:34)
you because you love FPS is but yeah I (34:31 - 34:38)
just I Wow I mean what it's hard to say (34:34 - 34:42)
right I can't say that I need a story (34:38 - 34:43)
for me to be able to enjoy a game (34:42 - 34:46)
because boy I do enjoy the heck out of (34:43 - 34:50)
Monster Hunter and no stories minimal (34:46 - 34:52)
store I mean you get you can read the (34:50 - 34:54)
little dialogues and kind of put pieces (34:52 - 34:56)
together of what's happening to certain (34:54 - 34:59)
people and PCs and such but it's just (34:56 - 35:05)
like that battle arena just mmm now I (34:59 - 35:07)
the I guess the skills that you have to (35:05 - 35:09)
develop it's that's not what brings (35:07 - 35:12)
enjoyment for me I dunno I mean I have a (35:09 - 35:15)
friend who like literally the only video (35:12 - 35:18)
games that he plays are fighting games (35:15 - 35:22)
and like that is his jam it is I just (35:18 - 35:25)
can't comprehend it it doesn't speak to (35:22 - 35:28)
me so yeah I don't know I mean Empoleon (35:25 - 35:31)
is cool but I mean I have an employee on (35:28 - 35:35)
in living pokedex so there you go I (35:31 - 35:37)
think the the whole presentation of that (35:35 - 35:39)
was fantastic though like that (35:37 - 35:42)
commercial or whatever you want to call (35:39 - 35:46)
it made me excited for pokken well it (35:42 - 35:48)
kind of made me wanna travel the world (35:46 - 35:51)
and have fun and then I realized I'm too (35:48 - 35:53)
old to stay in hostels so that's not (35:51 - 35:56)
gonna happen (35:53 - 35:56)
I wonder if pokin will get more after (35:56 - 36:04)
this and I say that because there is a (36:00 - 36:08)
big push for arms and they said you know (36:04 - 36:10)
all future content will be free we're (36:08 - 36:12)
gonna add more arms we're gonna add more (36:10 - 36:14)
characters we're gonna add more arenas (36:12 - 36:17)
and they said the same exact thing for (36:14 - 36:19)
splatoon we're gonna add more guns we're (36:17 - 36:20)
gonna add more modes we're gonna add (36:19 - 36:25)
more arenas and pokken is now on that on (36:20 - 36:28)
that pillar of these three games are (36:25 - 36:30)
your summer competitive games so I (36:28 - 36:32)
wonder if they're gonna do the same for (36:30 - 36:35)
pokken I think pokken suffers from a (36:32 - 36:39)
smaller roster my complaint and I don't (36:35 - 36:40)
know if other people share this my (36:39 - 36:44)
complaint is I didn't like the 3d from (36:40 - 36:49)
the back into like a 2d space yeah (36:44 - 36:52)
the that conversion and the yet hmm and (36:49 - 36:55)
and your your moves were different in (36:52 - 36:57)
that 3d space than they were in the 2d (36:55 - 37:00)
space and the 2d space is still 3d don't (36:57 - 37:03)
get me wrong but it was 3d as the way (37:00 - 37:06)
Tekken was 3d of okay we're in 3d but (37:03 - 37:07)
we're consistently looking at each other (37:06 - 37:10)
and we can sidestep clearly pokken is (37:07 - 37:12)
based on Tekken just look at the names (37:10 - 37:16)
and pokken is made by Namco Bandai so (37:12 - 37:19)
this clear we know Game Freak is working (37:16 - 37:22)
on a switch game we know pokken isn't it (37:19 - 37:24)
because Game Freak doesn't make pokum so (37:22 - 37:27)
that kind of clears up that that area (37:24 - 37:30)
but if there was a mode in the game that (37:27 - 37:32)
was just like hey we're just gonna do (37:30 - 37:34)
the we're just gonna do the Tekken stuff (37:32 - 37:37)
and not that open 3d stuff I would (37:34 - 37:39)
actually probably be down to buy that (37:37 - 37:41)
version or at least have that mode in (37:39 - 37:44)
the game because I just didn't like that (37:41 - 37:46)
view swap well and you also have to (37:44 - 37:48)
learn a different control mechanic when (37:46 - 37:51)
it swaps right it actually changes your (37:48 - 37:55)
your guard hit and all that biz so yeah (37:51 - 37:57)
I mean obviously I did not get it drawn (37:55 - 37:59)
in by poking tournament I only got it so (37:57 - 38:01)
that I could beat you and I only beat (37:59 - 38:03)
you by like spamming the a buttons yo (38:01 - 38:07)
and then $60 well forget $60 well spent (38:03 - 38:08)
was my overwatch (38:07 - 38:10)
[Laughter] (38:08 - 38:12)
all right so during the pokin commercial (38:10 - 38:14)
we get to the two little boys in the (38:12 - 38:15)
house (38:14 - 38:17)
papa brother or whoever that was brought (38:15 - 38:21)
the kids three DS games I've read the (38:17 - 38:23)
press release here during the pokemon (38:21 - 38:25)
direct viewers also saw first footage (38:23 - 38:28)
from the newest titles in the Pokemon (38:25 - 38:30)
series pokemon ultra Sun and Pokemon (38:28 - 38:34)
ultramoon two new Pokemon forms are (38:30 - 38:36)
shown resembling that of the legendary (38:34 - 38:38)
Pokemon Sol Gallio and new Lu Nala (38:36 - 38:41)
pokemon ultra Sun and Pokemon moon have (38:38 - 38:43)
been powered up with new additions to (38:41 - 38:47)
the story and features from Pokemon Sun (38:43 - 38:49)
and Pokemon and Moon Pokemon ultra Sun (38:47 - 38:51)
and ultra Moon are scheduled to be (38:49 - 38:54)
released worldwide on November 17th more (38:51 - 38:56)
information about the games will be (38:54 - 38:58)
revealed later this year what are your (38:56 - 39:03)
thoughts I have a lot to say but so my (38:58 - 39:09)
fundamental thoughts are a yes so (39:03 - 39:11)
obviously something in line with black (39:09 - 39:13)
and white - do you think this is black (39:11 - 39:14)
and white - or do you think this is (39:13 - 39:16)
platinum because I would say there's no (39:14 - 39:19)
net net net net it platinum but by (39:16 - 39:21)
saying something in line with black and (39:19 - 39:23)
white - I mean the fact that it's a (39:21 - 39:25)
fusion of necrosha and whatever (39:23 - 39:29)
legendary oh the crowd yes (39:25 - 39:31)
they're not even hinting at that they're (39:29 - 39:33)
like almost saying it explicitly that (39:31 - 39:36)
that is like the core of the game it is (39:33 - 39:39)
ya know it's platinum it is Pokemon Sun (39:36 - 39:41)
and Moon you get different clothes you (39:39 - 39:43)
get a little bucket hat that's real cute (39:41 - 39:45)
different kind of shorts but you're (39:43 - 39:47)
going to basically be following the same (39:45 - 39:53)
story path with adjustments so maybe (39:47 - 39:58)
it's like team skull and the other ether (39:53 - 40:00)
foundation are swapped that I don't know (39:58 - 40:03)
I I didn't get to play platinum so right (40:00 - 40:05)
the end goal is going to be different (40:03 - 40:07)
there's going to be some some changes (40:05 - 40:09)
along the line so that the ending comes (40:07 - 40:12)
out different but it's not going to be (40:09 - 40:15)
like five years later here's what's (40:12 - 40:18)
happening in a Lola and and that kind of (40:15 - 40:19)
in advance that's that's super important (40:18 - 40:22)
right there because based off the (40:19 - 40:24)
verbage they've used in Pokemon (40:22 - 40:27)
very specific they're very detailed when (40:24 - 40:29)
it comes to the verbage they used the (40:27 - 40:31)
press releases they send out the (40:29 - 40:34)
trailers they show when you look at (40:31 - 40:37)
platinum or emerald or crystal they were (40:34 - 40:41)
more or less the same stories with minor (40:37 - 40:44)
changes some additions some extra (40:41 - 40:47)
content when you look at black and white (40:44 - 40:50)
to that game yes it said in the same (40:47 - 40:52)
generation but that game is set five (40:50 - 40:55)
years later from the first story they're (40:52 - 40:58)
telling an all-new story to the point (40:55 - 41:02)
where Sharon and Bianca are older and (40:58 - 41:04)
they're guiding you in a totally (41:02 - 41:06)
different way than they they were and (41:04 - 41:08)
will you can speak to the changes more (41:06 - 41:10)
than I can since generation 5 is your (41:08 - 41:12)
favorite but black white 2 was not just (41:10 - 41:15)
an addition no and there was literally a (41:12 - 41:17)
component of the game where you could (41:15 - 41:20)
import some of the save information from (41:17 - 41:21)
pokemon black and white so that as (41:20 - 41:23)
you're going through the story of black (41:21 - 41:24)
and white two people have memories of (41:23 - 41:27)
what your protagonist in black and white (41:24 - 41:30)
did as part of the story flashbacks and (41:27 - 41:32)
such like that if this was if this was a (41:30 - 41:34)
full sequel like black and white 2 they (41:32 - 41:36)
would have said so like they did with (41:34 - 41:38)
black and white to the the very first (41:36 - 41:39)
press released that black and white 2 (41:38 - 41:43)
sent out honed in on an entirely new (41:39 - 41:45)
story and they didn't really say much (41:43 - 41:48)
more until a later date yeah I mean you (41:45 - 41:51)
started in a different town and you (41:48 - 41:53)
followed a whole different path (41:51 - 41:56)
- well until you gotten to the point (41:53 - 41:58)
where the paths crossed but I mean it (41:56 - 42:01)
was definitely a different game and I (41:58 - 42:03)
mean just like there's like hints about (42:01 - 42:05)
similarities to black and white - (42:03 - 42:08)
obviously colbus is very visible in (42:05 - 42:10)
sorry spoilers for a game that's been (42:08 - 42:12)
out for 7 months now but he's very (42:10 - 42:16)
visible in a Lola so that was like your (42:12 - 42:18)
kind of indication that there would be (42:16 - 42:22)
some kind of Pokemon fusion type DNA (42:18 - 42:25)
splicers deal going on and he wasn't (42:22 - 42:29)
just there to hand out the pieces but I (42:25 - 42:30)
mean we'll see it's just yeah it's gonna (42:29 - 42:32)
be enhancement obviously they've shown (42:30 - 42:35)
new screen footage so there's new (42:32 - 42:38)
cutscenes and probably some new areas (42:35 - 42:40)
that you'll go to but I thought the PSU (42:38 - 42:43)
area which is a new area that would fall (42:40 - 42:46)
under new additions um yeah it's I think (42:43 - 42:49)
it's like an alternate telling of the (42:46 - 42:52)
same story that informs the original (42:49 - 42:55)
story it expands enough in a way so that (42:52 - 42:56)
we will have more information about what (42:55 - 42:59)
was really happening in Pokemon Sun and (42:56 - 43:03)
Moon like what what is going on with Mon (42:59 - 43:07)
you know why does he like not care about (43:03 - 43:11)
his children and family maybe some more (43:07 - 43:13)
information about the ultra wormholes in (43:11 - 43:15)
the relationship between ultra beasts (43:13 - 43:17)
and Pokemon since obviously they can be (43:15 - 43:19)
captured and stored just like Pokemon (43:17 - 43:23)
and eat berries and beans and such so I (43:19 - 43:25)
mean it's it's gonna give us more (43:23 - 43:26)
information on that so it's going to be (43:25 - 43:29)
a more a fuller game but not to the (43:26 - 43:32)
point where you're going to be learning (43:29 - 43:35)
a new a whole new story ya know and you (43:32 - 43:37)
know at team skull and the other (43:35 - 43:38)
foundation aren't gonna swap team skull (43:37 - 43:41)
are still gonna be lunkheads I would be (43:38 - 43:45)
amazed and pleased if they do something (43:41 - 43:47)
to change the presentation of team skull (43:45 - 43:49)
because obviously we didn't see any team (43:47 - 43:51)
skull in this teaser trailer right yeah (43:49 - 43:53)
they didn't appear at all we just saw (43:51 - 43:55)
the protagonist character's new clothes (43:53 - 43:59)
and some new cutscenes they could (43:55 - 44:01)
possibly fix some of the issues that (43:59 - 44:05)
people had with team skull but its Japan (44:01 - 44:07)
let's address some some things do you (44:05 - 44:11)
think new mega Pokemon no mega Pokemon (44:07 - 44:13)
this is not the generation for Megas so (44:11 - 44:17)
do you think new alow landforms I would (44:13 - 44:21)
strongly suspect that since that was one (44:17 - 44:23)
of my most disappointing parts of black (44:21 - 44:25)
and white to that yes there will be new (44:23 - 44:26)
a little informs I think so too (44:25 - 44:29)
possibly in new areas that you have to (44:26 - 44:30)
go to or you know new areas that you (44:29 - 44:32)
come across that that's where you'll (44:30 - 44:34)
find them which I hope would be the case (44:32 - 44:35)
because that makes more logic it's a (44:34 - 44:37)
more logically consistent universe if (44:35 - 44:40)
you do that anyway I would hope that the (44:37 - 44:42)
next bit of news we'll talk about which (44:40 - 44:44)
is gold and silver coming to the Virtual (44:42 - 44:46)
Console that that's a sign that we will (44:44 - 44:49)
get generation 2 a lowland forms (44:46 - 44:51)
I don't want any more generation one of (44:49 - 44:53)
low informs I think if they're going to (44:51 - 44:57)
stick with that formula all Pokemon (44:53 - 44:58)
across all generations can have mega (44:57 - 45:01)
forms but not everyone I hope that it's (44:58 - 45:03)
all Pokemon across every generation can (45:01 - 45:06)
have alternative forms but not everyone (45:03 - 45:09)
so I hope that we do get some generation (45:06 - 45:12)
to 11 forms I think that would be great (45:09 - 45:18)
do you think it's too soon ah I think (45:12 - 45:21)
possibly because of some other things (45:18 - 45:22)
that we've discussed which I don't know (45:21 - 45:25)
if you want to talk about or not that (45:22 - 45:30)
probably no it is not too soon okay I (45:25 - 45:34)
have some numbers here these numbers are (45:30 - 45:37)
just averages you know if I'm if I'm if (45:34 - 45:40)
I'm Way off please let me know but from (45:37 - 45:43)
red and green to yellow this is weird (45:40 - 45:46)
too because not every Pokemon game has (45:43 - 45:49)
had worldwide releases like Japan got (45:46 - 45:52)
certain games way before us or sometimes (45:49 - 45:54)
it was only three months before us but (45:52 - 45:55)
I'm saying red and green not red blue so (45:54 - 45:57)
from red and green to yellow there was (45:55 - 46:01)
31 months in between so over two years (45:57 - 46:03)
little less than three years is a better (46:01 - 46:05)
way to say that okay that's fair and I (46:03 - 46:06)
wouldn't say that yellow is that (46:05 - 46:09)
dramatically different than then red (46:06 - 46:11)
green or blue you they added the Pikachu (46:09 - 46:13)
followed you it was easier to get the (46:11 - 46:16)
three starters they added Team Rocket at (46:13 - 46:19)
certain points but for this for the same (46:16 - 46:22)
for all intents and purposes did I say (46:19 - 46:25)
that right in ten that is correct yes (46:22 - 46:28)
it's the same story so 31 months between (46:25 - 46:30)
those games from gold and silver to (46:28 - 46:34)
crystal 19 months from Ruby and Sapphire (46:30 - 46:38)
to emerald 23 months from diamond and (46:34 - 46:42)
pearl to platinum 2 years 24 months from (46:38 - 46:45)
black and white to black and white to 20 (46:42 - 46:49)
months from Sun and Moon to ultra Sun (46:45 - 46:52)
and Moon 12 months I mean they're (46:49 - 46:53)
they're getting better at programming (46:52 - 46:56)
Congrats not even not even a full year (46:53 - 46:59)
I'm pretty sure that Sunday moon came (46:56 - 47:01)
out on November 18th and these games are (46:59 - 47:05)
coming out on November 17th 364 days not (47:01 - 47:09)
even a full year I've said this before I (47:05 - 47:11)
don't want my Pokemon games to be Call (47:09 - 47:14)
of Duty I don't want a Pokemon game ever (47:11 - 47:16)
mayne serious pokemon game every year (47:14 - 47:18)
sure give me your pokemon shuffles in (47:16 - 47:20)
between give me your mystery dungeons in (47:18 - 47:21)
between give me something to hold me (47:20 - 47:23)
over but I think it's really special to (47:21 - 47:26)
have a main series game and I'm not (47:23 - 47:28)
saying I won't play ultra son an ultra (47:26 - 47:31)
moon I just worry that there will be (47:28 - 47:33)
burnout for some people well that was (47:31 - 47:37)
like me playing Omega Ruby where I had (47:33 - 47:39)
like literally very recently played (47:37 - 47:41)
emerald and I was like wow this story (47:39 - 47:44)
over again they're gonna have to really (47:41 - 47:47)
wow me to to impress me with obviously (47:44 - 47:49)
I'm gonna play it but for me to put some (47:47 - 47:50)
real interest in it especially also cuz (47:49 - 47:53)
I just started playing Pokemon son so if (47:50 - 47:55)
I take my leisurely time getting through (47:53 - 47:57)
that I may just be finishing that up (47:55 - 48:00)
when ultra son ultra moon come out it (47:57 - 48:01)
was it wasn't even a week or so ago I (48:00 - 48:03)
was considering playing Pokemon moon (48:01 - 48:06)
just because I didn't really want to do (48:03 - 48:09)
anything more and son like yeah I could (48:06 - 48:11)
get ultra beast but I kind of wanted to (48:09 - 48:13)
I kind of wanted to go through the story (48:11 - 48:14)
again at a slower pace since I played (48:13 - 48:16)
through that game so fast too that is (48:14 - 48:20)
exactly what I'm doing but now but now (48:16 - 48:22)
that they announced this why bother (48:20 - 48:24)
well so I mean the one other (48:22 - 48:25)
recommendation I could make for you (48:24 - 48:28)
that's really keeping me having fun now (48:25 - 48:31)
playing Pokemon Sun is I have built like (48:28 - 48:36)
the most unrealistic for the newcomer to (48:31 - 48:39)
a Lola team I like I don't think oh I (48:36 - 48:41)
haven't been make you on there but it's (48:39 - 48:44)
like a lot of Gen 5 Pokemon and another (48:41 - 48:47)
Pokemon that I all hatched from eggs and (48:44 - 48:50)
it's like why why is Darumaka available (48:47 - 48:52)
on the first island and like my starter (48:50 - 48:55)
so that makes it fun for me okay let's (48:52 - 48:55)
address (48:55 - 48:57)
the elephant in the room here these (48:55 - 49:00)
games are on 3ds they are not on (48:57 - 49:05)
Nintendo switch supposedly I feel the (49:00 - 49:07)
same way anywhere you look there's gonna (49:05 - 49:09)
be debate about this whether that's (49:07 - 49:11)
reddit Twitter Facebook our slack (49:09 - 49:15)
community this was a huge topic of (49:11 - 49:17)
conversation these games got announced (49:15 - 49:20)
for 3ds they did not a get announced for (49:17 - 49:23)
switch so far so far let's back up why (49:20 - 49:25)
did everyone think they were gonna be (49:23 - 49:28)
announced for switch on November 17th (49:25 - 49:29)
2016 (49:28 - 49:32)
Eurogamer started all of this they (49:29 - 49:35)
reported that Game Freak was working on (49:32 - 49:38)
a third version of Pokemon Sun and Moon (49:35 - 49:41)
that was codenamed never the final name (49:38 - 49:46)
just codenamed stars that was the really (49:41 - 49:49)
the one and only rumor that we ever got (49:46 - 49:51)
about this I think it I think it's safe (49:49 - 49:54)
to say that there was a lot of trust put (49:51 - 49:57)
into that rumor based on what Eurogamer (49:54 - 50:01)
reported on before which was a week to (49:57 - 50:02)
two weeks before the Nintendo switch (50:01 - 50:05)
came out they got the price right they (50:02 - 50:08)
got the screen right they got the date (50:05 - 50:10)
right they got everything right about (50:08 - 50:12)
the Nintendo switch so then after the (50:10 - 50:15)
Nintendo switch press conference (50:12 - 50:18)
happened Sun and Moon came out they (50:15 - 50:20)
reported on Starz it's hard to say (50:18 - 50:23)
they're just lying about this when (50:20 - 50:27)
clearly they got a lot right just a (50:23 - 50:29)
month ago about the new tennis switch (50:27 - 50:32)
when we all started playing Pokemon Sun (50:29 - 50:35)
and Moon it was night and day you (50:32 - 50:38)
instantly noticed this the slowdown that (50:35 - 50:42)
happened you noticed right away that hey (50:38 - 50:44)
they're not really doing anything with (50:42 - 50:47)
the bottom screen you notice that they (50:44 - 50:51)
removed the PBS system the upscaling oh (50:47 - 50:53)
and then the the big upscaling (50:51 - 50:56)
thing that happened where people who (50:53 - 50:59)
dumped the ROM on a computer saw how (50:56 - 51:02)
good-looking this game could be like wow (50:59 - 51:05)
they put a lot of effort and time into (51:02 - 51:09)
these sprites for a system that (51:05 - 51:12)
handle it at all so you haven't can't (51:09 - 51:14)
resolve them accurately right see (51:12 - 51:17)
sufficiently you have those points of (51:14 - 51:18)
actually playing the game and seeing all (51:17 - 51:21)
these kind of odd choices that happened (51:18 - 51:24)
and you have the Eurogamer rumor on top (51:21 - 51:26)
of don't forget that Game Freak has been (51:24 - 51:30)
confirmed working on and attend a switch (51:26 - 51:31)
game then it's not pokin we know it's (51:30 - 51:34)
not pokin so that's where this all all (51:31 - 51:37)
this built from and then they went ahead (51:34 - 51:40)
and they said hey this is going to be on (51:37 - 51:43)
the 3ds and it's going to be on the (51:40 - 51:46)
switch to be determined and then (51:43 - 51:48)
everyone said oh it is gonna be on the (51:46 - 51:50)
switch you just didn't say what your (51:48 - 51:53)
trailer the press release said on the (51:50 - 51:55)
switch to be determined yes and then (51:53 - 51:56)
create the original press release then (51:55 - 51:58)
Kotaku reached out to them and they (51:56 - 52:02)
replied woops sorry we messed up nope (51:58 - 52:03)
nope not gonna be on switch exclusively (52:02 - 52:06)
3ds not going to be on switch don't know (52:03 - 52:10)
how that got into the press release (52:06 - 52:10)
for a company that is so dedicated to (52:11 - 52:18)
controlling their message whether that's (52:16 - 52:19)
through text whether that's through (52:18 - 52:21)
Twitter whether that's through a (52:19 - 52:25)
eight-minute direct (52:21 - 52:27)
how did they mess that up how did they (52:25 - 52:29)
put out a press release and say that (52:27 - 52:32)
this 3ds game is also going to be on the (52:29 - 52:35)
Nintendo switch and then ten minutes (52:32 - 52:38)
later go whoops that was a mistake (52:35 - 52:42)
um carelessness the person who was in (52:38 - 52:43)
charge of that press release was (52:42 - 52:46)
overworked and underpaid and a little (52:43 - 52:47)
tired at the end of the day and they (52:46 - 52:49)
just took the monster hunter press (52:47 - 52:52)
release and swapped out the main text (52:49 - 52:55)
look I don't I don't at the end of the (52:52 - 52:57)
day I don't care I would be very excited (52:55 - 52:59)
and I would buy a switch version if (52:57 - 53:00)
that's the case if that's what they show (52:59 - 53:03)
at e3 awesome I don't think anyone (53:00 - 53:06)
doubted for a second that it wasn't also (53:03 - 53:09)
going to be on 3ds there are 66 million (53:06 - 53:11)
3ds out there there are only three (53:09 - 53:13)
million switches out there I'm rounding (53:11 - 53:15)
up yeah I was gonna say I agree with you (53:13 - 53:17)
if it can be on both it will be on both (53:15 - 53:20)
that's how you sell more copies if it's (53:17 - 53:23)
not on the switch then what is Game (53:20 - 53:25)
Freak working on if it's not on the (53:23 - 53:28)
switch why did that press release have (53:25 - 53:30)
that mistake if it's not on the switch (53:28 - 53:33)
what was your gamer talking about if (53:30 - 53:36)
it's not on the switch then why does the (53:33 - 53:39)
game run so poorly I still do not buy (53:36 - 53:42)
for a second that the number one (53:39 - 53:45)
best-selling handheld game throughout (53:42 - 53:48)
all these years maybe Tetris beats it (53:45 - 53:50)
I'm not sure but Pokemon is the second (53:48 - 53:52)
biggest franchise in the world following (53:50 - 53:56)
Mario and that game runs like garbage on (53:52 - 53:59)
the new Nintendo 3ds on the system that (53:56 - 54:02)
they put out a four to copper to make up (53:59 - 54:05)
for the six year old piece of hardware (54:02 - 54:07)
they made a better system with a better (54:05 - 54:09)
processor that could run games better (54:07 - 54:11)
and this game does not run better it (54:09 - 54:13)
runs like garbage well in your opinion I (54:11 - 54:15)
think you're a little too critical I (54:13 - 54:16)
don't really (54:15 - 54:19)
unless I'm looking for it I don't really (54:16 - 54:21)
notice these things but you tend to be (54:19 - 54:22)
more critical about these things than I (54:21 - 54:24)
do I mean it didn't stop me from playing (54:22 - 54:27)
it when you look back or when you look (54:24 - 54:31)
at show pieces for your sister system (54:27 - 54:33)
and you and pokemons gonna be up there (54:31 - 54:34)
with Mario Cart of like these were the (54:33 - 54:37)
games that carried the 3ds it's just (54:34 - 54:38)
kind of weird that (54:37 - 54:40)
of the games that carried the 3ds didn't (54:38 - 54:44)
run great on the three I want to talk (54:40 - 54:47)
about the switch as a handheld so let's (54:44 - 54:50)
say ultra sudden ultra moon also for (54:47 - 54:52)
example before I before I start this (54:50 - 54:54)
rant I will say that I'm going to play (54:52 - 54:56)
ultra 17 ultramoon I am excited because (54:54 - 54:59)
I do want to go back to a Lola what I am (54:56 - 55:01)
the most curious about that probably no (54:59 - 55:03)
one else is thinking about is are they (55:01 - 55:04)
going to include those pokemon gold (55:03 - 55:07)
ribbons in ultra Sun and ultra moon (55:04 - 55:10)
because we we were told that go was (55:07 - 55:11)
supposed to transfer to Sun and Moon (55:10 - 55:14)
there are the little icons in the game (55:11 - 55:17)
that say that this Pokemon is from (55:14 - 55:19)
Pokemon go I want to know if those (55:17 - 55:21)
ribbons still exist in the new game (55:19 - 55:23)
because I want to know if they have (55:21 - 55:26)
given up on that or if they're still (55:23 - 55:28)
working on that I don't know that's just (55:26 - 55:29)
something I care about personally okay (55:28 - 55:32)
back to the switch with all this debate (55:29 - 55:35)
of oh I wish it was diamond and pearl or (55:32 - 55:37)
I wish it was stars on switch or I wish (55:35 - 55:39)
it was this I wish it was that the thing (55:37 - 55:41)
I kind of see that happens between these (55:39 - 55:44)
conversations is why would the Pokemon (55:41 - 55:47)
company put Pokemon on a console that is (55:44 - 55:50)
a home console and I'm sick of hearing (55:47 - 55:54)
that that argument do you really do (55:50 - 55:55)
people really think that there's going (55:54 - 55:58)
to be a four DS or there's going to be a (55:55 - 56:02)
new game boy or I why wouldn't it Tendo (55:58 - 56:04)
do that why would you make a portable (56:02 - 56:06)
system when the switch exists with a (56:04 - 56:08)
slightly smaller screen and what a worse (56:06 - 56:13)
processor why the 3ds came out six years (56:08 - 56:16)
ago and launched with steel diver it's (56:13 - 56:18)
not like it had a good library when it (56:16 - 56:19)
launched and then all of us got did it (56:18 - 56:21)
launched actually didn't launch at 250 (56:19 - 56:24)
and then we all got ambassador programs (56:21 - 56:25)
because they apologized (56:24 - 56:27)
that's all that's what I was just going (56:25 - 56:28)
to say is that the the switch is gonna (56:27 - 56:32)
drop by $100 by probably December of (56:28 - 56:35)
this year oh no no not to make sure that (56:32 - 56:36)
it's long enough I wouldn't say it well (56:35 - 56:38)
you're up I would say they would put in (56:36 - 56:40)
one to two games before they drop it (56:38 - 56:42)
they're okay they're gonna stick like (56:40 - 56:45)
mario carton and I don't know (56:42 - 56:49)
splatoon one or something there (56:45 - 56:50)
not gonna ambassador program that (56:49 - 56:53)
because they lost some money on that (56:50 - 56:55)
I've got those sweet sweet original (56:53 - 56:57)
Mario games and Zelda games because of (56:55 - 57:00)
that so which launches at $2.99 3ds (56:57 - 57:03)
originally launched at 250 what possible (57:00 - 57:07)
hand held could they release that (57:03 - 57:09)
wouldn't eat the switches lunch or vice (57:07 - 57:11)
versa the switch is just gonna eat its (57:09 - 57:14)
lunch I have a quote from the Sudha that (57:11 - 57:16)
I think is very important and I think (57:14 - 57:18)
well hopefully our listeners end this (57:16 - 57:21)
conversation about Pokemon being on (57:18 - 57:23)
quote unquote a home console because (57:21 - 57:26)
watch any trailer with the switch the (57:23 - 57:27)
switch is always outside the switch is (57:26 - 57:29)
always on a train the switch is in a (57:27 - 57:32)
park at a party it's never just it might (57:29 - 57:35)
end or start in somebody's home but the (57:32 - 57:37)
switch is a portable console it is the (57:35 - 57:40)
handheld if anything was to blow my mind (57:37 - 57:42)
it would be Nintendo releasing another (57:40 - 57:45)
handheld and trying to have both that (57:42 - 57:46)
and the switch on the market here's a (57:45 - 57:51)
quote from Masuda from kotaku 2015 quote (57:46 - 57:53)
there are different types of people out (57:51 - 57:55)
there people who want to play at home at (57:53 - 57:58)
their own pace and really just enjoy the (57:55 - 57:59)
world and people who want to play with (57:58 - 58:01)
other players and meet them in real life (57:59 - 58:04)
what I've always said about the reason (58:01 - 58:06)
why we put Pokemon on the handheld (58:04 - 58:09)
system is the handheld system allows you (58:06 - 58:12)
to do both you can play at your own pace (58:09 - 58:14)
at home but you can also meet with other (58:12 - 58:17)
people and I think that's the power of (58:14 - 58:20)
Pokemon is the power of communication (58:17 - 58:22)
Pokemon brings people together and I (58:20 - 58:24)
really like that element which is why we (58:22 - 58:27)
continue to put them out on handhelds (58:24 - 58:29)
but there are a lot of people who want a (58:27 - 58:32)
home console version we know especially (58:29 - 58:34)
with internet features that let people (58:32 - 58:37)
battle and trade but the way that (58:34 - 58:39)
handhelds allow people to come together (58:37 - 58:41)
if we could figure out how to make that (58:39 - 58:44)
happen on consoles it would be an option (58:41 - 58:47)
on the future but right now that's just (58:44 - 58:50)
not possible if you've ever been in an (58:47 - 58:51)
audience of the Pokemon World (58:50 - 58:53)
Championships that's my ideal for (58:51 - 58:55)
Pokemon all these people gathering (58:53 - 58:57)
together and playing with each other if (58:55 - 59:01)
there were a way a console could enable (58:57 - 59:03)
that it might be an option (59:01 - 59:07)
but right now handheld it is and quote (59:03 - 59:09)
where was that quote from time date and (59:07 - 59:13)
where was it printed that was January (59:09 - 59:21)
27th 2015 on Kotaku UK 2015 interesting (59:13 - 59:25)
date it was right after it was after X&Y (59:21 - 59:27)
because they talked about X and while (59:25 - 59:29)
possibly at a time when he would be (59:27 - 59:32)
aware of the development of a new device (59:29 - 59:36)
called this new Tendo switch which is it (59:32 - 59:38)
it has to be it (59:36 - 59:40)
and this isn't even a conversation if (59:38 - 59:42)
ultra moon and ultra Sun doesn't come to (59:40 - 59:44)
switch I think at that point it's (59:42 - 59:46)
irrelevant if it doesn't come to switch (59:44 - 59:50)
fine let them sell there however melon (59:46 - 59:52)
however many millions of copies on the (59:50 - 59:55)
3ds because there are 66 million 3ds is (59:52 - 59:58)
out there but I think the conversation (59:55 - 60:01)
starts and ends at eventually we are (59:58 - 60:03)
getting a full Pokemon game on switch (60:01 - 60:06)
there's no way another main series game (60:03 - 60:08)
is coming to 3ds or they stopped making (60:06 - 60:10)
Pokemon games altogether yeah that would (60:08 - 60:12)
probably be the best outcome really I (60:10 - 60:14)
think that quote though is probably the (60:12 - 60:17)
most important thing though that we've (60:14 - 60:19)
said in the last hour I know I think so (60:17 - 60:21)
I think that that's very telling I think (60:19 - 60:24)
that the time at when he would have said (60:21 - 60:25)
that at a time where he might have (60:24 - 60:27)
knowledge of the plans to have the (60:25 - 60:31)
switch where he could say ok I'm aware (60:27 - 60:32)
of this I can't say anything about it (60:31 - 60:35)
directly but boy this actually meets (60:32 - 60:36)
directly with the vision that I have for (60:35 - 60:39)
this game so I'm gonna Telegraph that (60:36 - 60:42)
this is coming in two to three years and (60:39 - 60:45)
and if they announced Ultra Sun and (60:42 - 60:48)
ultra moon at e3 on switch which I think (60:45 - 60:50)
would be fantastic only because that's (60:48 - 60:53)
where I would prefer to play it Monster (60:50 - 60:56)
Hunter cross has already shown us it is (60:53 - 60:59)
possible to play and tray or not trade (60:56 - 61:03)
but play between a switch and a 3ds this (60:59 - 61:05)
would be a good way of giving switch (61:03 - 61:08)
owners something to play like hey I'm (61:05 - 61:10)
not into I'm not into fighting games (61:08 - 61:12)
I'm not into third-person shooters I'm (61:10 - 61:14)
not into fighting games the first (61:12 - 61:15)
fighting game was pokin the second (61:14 - 61:16)
fighting game was armed (61:15 - 61:19)
I want a story based adventure all my (61:16 - 61:20)
friends were playing Pokemon this might (61:19 - 61:23)
be a good opportunity because the switch (61:20 - 61:24)
doesn't have a lot of stuff right now (61:23 - 61:26)
to get into that and still be able to (61:24 - 61:28)
play with 3ds owners still be able to (61:26 - 61:31)
transfer my Pokemon up if monster hunter (61:28 - 61:32)
can transfer game data between a switch (61:31 - 61:36)
and a 3ds which it which we learned two (61:32 - 61:38)
weeks ago that it can then we know (61:36 - 61:40)
something like Pokemon bank would work (61:38 - 61:43)
well also the my two things that I would (61:40 - 61:46)
have to contribute to this are one I (61:43 - 61:49)
believe the Pokemon cartridges used to (61:46 - 61:51)
have built in the method of (61:49 - 61:54)
communicating for doing the local (61:51 - 61:57)
wireless link trades this may be (61:54 - 61:59)
completely wrong but I think at one (61:57 - 62:02)
point they did because the two DS did (61:59 - 62:04)
not support that so they built it into (62:02 - 62:07)
the cartridge to support it so for the (62:04 - 62:08)
people saying all right you can't do (62:07 - 62:10)
caught cross-platform between a 3ds and (62:08 - 62:12)
a switch maybe they can build that into (62:10 - 62:15)
the cartridges so that it'll do the (62:12 - 62:16)
cross pat platform based on the (62:15 - 62:19)
cartridge number one number two it is (62:16 - 62:22)
now however many days after the original (62:19 - 62:26)
announcement and the website Pokemon Sun (62:22 - 62:31)
Moon calm whatever its like empty all it (62:26 - 62:33)
shows is the Nick rhizoma forms of the (62:31 - 62:35)
legendaries it doesn't show the new (62:33 - 62:37)
trainers it doesn't even show as much as (62:35 - 62:40)
that trailer showed so they're waiting (62:37 - 62:42)
for something else to come where it's (62:40 - 62:44)
going to be like a big glut of (62:42 - 62:46)
information to make that website (62:44 - 62:49)
something real I mean that's at least my (62:46 - 62:51)
point of view the Pokemon direct (62:49 - 62:55)
obviously happened a week before e3 (62:51 - 62:59)
because I don't think what they would (62:55 - 63:02)
have announced at e3 I think what if (62:59 - 63:04)
they announced what they did at e3 it (63:02 - 63:07)
would have got lost in the shuffle they (63:04 - 63:09)
announced that 3 there was also another (63:07 - 63:12)
issue that I saw that coro coro is going (63:09 - 63:16)
to publish before the e3 Nintendo date (63:12 - 63:19)
so they wanted to get in front of that (63:16 - 63:22)
ok but when you're when you're looking (63:19 - 63:25)
at when when all eyes are on III a lot (63:22 - 63:28)
of stuff can get lost especially when (63:25 - 63:30)
you know big games like (63:28 - 63:32)
Oh a God of war game is coming back or (63:30 - 63:36)
Last of Us 2 or 1 verse 100 on Xbox (63:32 - 63:37)
which I think they should bring back (63:36 - 63:39)
that would make me buy an Xbox but if (63:37 - 63:42)
Nintendo was to spend 8 minutes of their (63:39 - 63:45)
direct showing 3 rehashes of old games (63:42 - 63:47)
that would have gotten completely lost (63:45 - 63:50)
but if they get up on stage at e3 and (63:47 - 63:53)
they just show switch game switch game (63:50 - 63:55)
switch game switch game switch game and (63:53 - 63:58)
one of those switch games is ultra Sun (63:55 - 64:01)
and ultra moon now that's not going to (63:58 - 64:03)
get lost in the shuffle that's not going (64:01 - 64:06)
to upset 3ds owners right off the bat (64:03 - 64:07)
because they got their news they got (64:06 - 64:09)
everything they're satisfied for (64:07 - 64:12)
everything they show at the e3 stage is (64:09 - 64:14)
to get people wanting to buy a switch (64:12 - 64:17)
whereas announcing it wouldn't make (64:14 - 64:19)
sense to announce that at a Pokemon (64:17 - 64:21)
direct because that news is big enough (64:19 - 64:23)
at e3 to make it matter so we're just (64:21 - 64:26)
gonna announce the 3ds version here well (64:23 - 64:28)
now it's a switch version here and if (64:26 - 64:30)
there is no switch version that's fine (64:28 - 64:32)
that's still going back to what I said (64:30 - 64:35)
earlier ok so what is Game Freak working (64:32 - 64:39)
on and - we're gonna get a Pokemon game (64:35 - 64:40)
eventually so if it's not switch then I (64:39 - 64:42)
will welcome a new generation or (64:40 - 64:45)
something else instead I think that's (64:42 - 64:48)
all very well said last bit of news here (64:45 - 64:52)
is also announced the second titles in (64:48 - 64:53)
the Pokemon series pokemon gold and (64:52 - 64:55)
silver will be making their way to the (64:53 - 64:57)
Nintendo 3ds Virtual Console pokemon (64:55 - 64:59)
gold and silver were released in Japan (64:57 - 65:01)
on November 21st 1999 that's the second (64:59 - 65:02)
set of titles in the Pokemon series (65:01 - 65:05)
these games which debuted as gameboy (65:02 - 65:07)
color games in Japan are being recreated (65:05 - 65:09)
for the Virtual Console versions such as (65:07 - 65:11)
their screens appeared just as they did (65:09 - 65:13)
on the gameboy color both titles will be (65:11 - 65:15)
compatible with the wireless feature (65:13 - 65:17)
communications of the Nintendo 3ds and (65:15 - 65:19)
trainers can look forward to link trades (65:17 - 65:20)
and link battles between the virtual (65:19 - 65:22)
console versions of pokemon gold and (65:20 - 65:23)
pokemon silver (65:22 - 65:25)
in addition these titles will be (65:23 - 65:26)
compatible with the time capsule (65:25 - 65:28)
function function which allows players (65:26 - 65:30)
to linked Pokemon between virtual (65:28 - 65:32)
console versions of pokemon gold and (65:30 - 65:33)
silver and the Virtual Console versions (65:32 - 65:36)
of pokemon red blue and yellow in (65:33 - 65:38)
Pokemon centers within these games both (65:36 - 65:40)
titles will be compatible with Pokemon (65:38 - 65:42)
Bank and will also launch on September (65:40 - 65:44)
22nd 2017 (65:42 - 65:49)
I mean that's like I not exciting I mean (65:44 - 65:51)
gold and soul silver exists they were (65:49 - 65:53)
improvements and perfections of those (65:51 - 65:56)
original games so you've got to be a (65:53 - 66:01)
real nostalgia addict to be excited I I (65:56 - 66:01)
don't know (66:01 - 66:03)
this is this this might be my last rant (66:01 - 66:06)
for the show although I don't think I (66:03 - 66:09)
was if I was hard on son an ultra move (66:06 - 66:10)
and I'm very excited for those games I (66:09 - 66:12)
would be a little more excited if they (66:10 - 66:14)
were on switch but if they're not okay (66:12 - 66:17)
not the end of the world why is anyone (66:14 - 66:20)
excited for this alright I can give you (66:17 - 66:21)
I can give you one thing I'm gonna (66:20 - 66:22)
interrupt your rant because I forgot to (66:21 - 66:24)
say it when I was talking and I just (66:22 - 66:25)
remembered it (66:24 - 66:27)
yes HeartGold and SoulSilver are (66:25 - 66:32)
playable on the 3ds yes but but in order (66:27 - 66:35)
to transfer Pokemon from those games up (66:32 - 66:40)
into Pokemon bank you have to like do (66:35 - 66:44)
the switch he thing between pokemon (66:40 - 66:47)
black and white and pokemon it's it's (66:44 - 66:49)
like that game and you have to shoot at (66:47 - 66:51)
the balls at them to get them to come (66:49 - 66:53)
over and you can only do like six at a (66:51 - 66:56)
time or something it's horrible the at (66:53 - 66:57)
least this gets you an easier way to get (66:56 - 67:00)
your gen 2 pokemon into gen 7 so i will (66:57 - 67:02)
give them that but go on with your rant (67:00 - 67:07)
alright I am sick and tired of Pokemon (67:02 - 67:10)
fans asking for remakes I might have (67:07 - 67:14)
been on this bandwagon 5 or 6 years ago (67:10 - 67:17)
maybe even three years as early as three (67:14 - 67:21)
years ago but I cannot think of another (67:17 - 67:24)
franchise that has that their fanbase (67:21 - 67:30)
asks for remakes time and time again (67:24 - 67:32)
if I want to play diamond and pearl my (67:30 - 67:35)
3ds can play diamond and pearl I'm not (67:32 - 67:38)
saying that the virtual console (67:35 - 67:42)
shouldn't have red blue yellow gold (67:38 - 67:46)
crystal silver firered/leafgreen I think (67:42 - 67:47)
Virtual Console should have them all (67:46 - 67:51)
would I go back and play them probably (67:47 - 67:54)
not especially in the the example of (67:51 - 67:58)
gold and silver why would I pay $10 for (67:54 - 68:02)
a game that is better that I own that I (67:58 - 68:04)
know exactly where it is it is in arm's (68:02 - 68:09)
reach of me and I have told people since (68:04 - 68:11)
I started this podcast that I think (68:09 - 68:14)
HeartGold and SoulSilver (68:11 - 68:18)
is easily one of the best Pokemon games (68:14 - 68:22)
of all time why would I pay for a less (68:18 - 68:26)
good version of that why I mean I (68:22 - 68:29)
already told you why but go on if they (68:26 - 68:32)
were to put those games on the Nintendo (68:29 - 68:34)
switch which they could they could say (68:32 - 68:37)
at e3 hey we're launching the Virtual (68:34 - 68:39)
Console these are the virtual console (68:37 - 68:41)
games that will appear for some reason (68:39 - 68:43)
we're Nintendo and some of the games (68:41 - 68:45)
don't make it to Virtual Console which (68:43 - 68:48)
makes no sense to me and I have not (68:45 - 68:51)
bought red yellow or blue because I've (68:48 - 68:54)
been burned so many times I bought so (68:51 - 68:57)
many Virtual Console games on Wii U and (68:54 - 69:00)
yeah they could make it to or on Wii and (68:57 - 69:02)
yeah they made it to wii u but i had to (69:00 - 69:04)
launch this really garbage emulator to (69:02 - 69:06)
play them and they wanted me to rebuy (69:04 - 69:08)
them again but don't worry we'll give (69:06 - 69:12)
you a discount it's unacceptable if they (69:08 - 69:15)
were to say hey we're launchin and again (69:12 - 69:17)
I think these games should be on Virtual (69:15 - 69:19)
Console I would probably consider buying (69:17 - 69:22)
red or blue because there I have no way (69:20 - 69:24)
I have no way of playing red or blue or (69:22 - 69:28)
fire red or leaf green on my 3ds if they (69:24 - 69:30)
were to say though hey we're putting (69:28 - 69:33)
gold and silver on switch and we're (69:30 - 69:37)
putting then this Pokemon game on switch (69:33 - 69:39)
and Pokemon bank will work and (69:37 - 69:40)
everything will be fine (69:39 - 69:43)
cool I have no way of playing (69:40 - 69:46)
gold silver or gold and silver I'm ice (69:43 - 69:49)
wish okay I will buy it I will play it (69:46 - 69:50)
it will be great because I carry my (69:49 - 69:52)
switch everywhere and I don't carry my (69:50 - 69:55)
3ds everywhere I just do not understand (69:52 - 69:57)
why people are excited for gold and (69:55 - 70:01)
silver on Virtual Console when one when (69:57 - 70:04)
easily the best Pokemon game in the last (70:01 - 70:05)
decade (70:04 - 70:08)
you can play on 3ds and yeah kind of (70:05 - 70:12)
sucks the transfer Pokemon but I I was I (70:08 - 70:14)
was the one that was wrong when I said (70:12 - 70:17)
Pokemon bank was so important to these (70:14 - 70:18)
old games and everyone said no it was (70:17 - 70:20)
impossible they can't do it it's too (70:18 - 70:22)
much work how would they do IVs how (70:20 - 70:25)
would they do v's the special attack and (70:22 - 70:26)
attack were the same this is so much (70:25 - 70:28)
work and I said no Pokemon Bank is the (70:26 - 70:30)
most important thing and they have (70:28 - 70:33)
finally remember months later announced (70:30 - 70:35)
that that feature was coming (70:33 - 70:38)
and everyone shut up about it I didn't (70:35 - 70:39)
shut up for six months because I (70:38 - 70:42)
considered that a important feature and (70:39 - 70:45)
it exists and that's fine but who is (70:42 - 70:46)
playing that to transfer Pokemon up (70:45 - 70:48)
they're not playing that transfer (70:46 - 70:49)
Pokemon up they're playing that for (70:48 - 70:52)
nostalgia maybe there's some moves that (70:49 - 70:55)
can only be learned by Pokemon in those (70:52 - 70:57)
versions of the games maybe but none of (70:55 - 70:59)
it the none of that matters because (70:57 - 71:00)
they're so strict when it comes to (70:59 - 71:02)
tournament about moves and stuff I'm not (71:00 - 71:07)
not strict enough mmm and crystals (71:02 - 71:08)
missing and that was another (71:07 - 71:10)
conversation of debate (71:08 - 71:12)
why isn't crystal there I can tell you (71:10 - 71:13)
why crystals there because if crystal (71:12 - 71:16)
existed no one would be guy buying gold (71:13 - 71:18)
and silver because crystal is the better (71:16 - 71:20)
game just like no one should buy gold (71:18 - 71:22)
and silver because HeartGold and (71:20 - 71:25)
SoulSilver is the better game the only (71:22 - 71:27)
way this Virtual Console stuff works and (71:25 - 71:30)
again they should be on Virtual Console (71:27 - 71:33)
but they but they are on a system where (71:30 - 71:36)
so many Pokemon games exists better (71:33 - 71:39)
versions of that game that it is hard to (71:36 - 71:41)
justify that purchase again if all these (71:39 - 71:43)
games were on switch and you had no (71:41 - 71:44)
access to play heartgold SoulSilver gold (71:43 - 71:46)
silver crystal firered/leafgreen that (71:44 - 71:49)
makes sense and it also makes sense that (71:46 - 71:51)
once you complete those old games you (71:49 - 71:54)
can transfer them to your Pokemon bank (71:51 - 71:57)
and whatever Pokemon game you have and (71:54 - 72:00)
now going back to my original argument (71:57 - 72:03)
of I started this rant and saying I (72:00 - 72:04)
don't think they should make any more (72:03 - 72:07)
remakes or more or less people should (72:04 - 72:09)
stop asking for remakes and I just told (72:07 - 72:11)
you that I think the best pokemon game (72:09 - 72:13)
in the decade last decade was hark old (72:11 - 72:15)
soul silver which happened to be a (72:13 - 72:19)
remake the difference there is that red (72:15 - 72:23)
blue yellow gold crystal and silver they (72:19 - 72:25)
got cut off from the hardware generation (72:23 - 72:27)
and there was no way to play those games (72:25 - 72:30)
without being able to transfer you like (72:27 - 72:32)
you could play those games obviously but (72:30 - 72:33)
there was no way to transfer this (72:32 - 72:35)
Pokemon so yes I do think that there was (72:33 - 72:38)
value to firered and leafgreen I do (72:35 - 72:39)
think there was value to heartgold (72:38 - 72:42)
SoulSilver I think and that that was my (72:39 - 72:44)
argument for Pokemon Bank that these (72:42 - 72:46)
game like every one of these games is (72:44 - 72:48)
important enough that if you play (72:46 - 72:49)
through it and you (72:48 - 72:50)
do that journey your Pokemon should come (72:49 - 72:53)
with you and hark old souls over exists (72:50 - 72:55)
because of that and so does firered and (72:53 - 72:56)
leafgreen (72:55 - 72:58)
did we need an Omega Ruby alpha sapphire (72:56 - 73:01)
remaked no is anyone on the internet (72:58 - 73:03)
going Oh Meg a ruby and alpha sapphire (73:01 - 73:06)
is my favorite game No and there might (73:03 - 73:08)
be some people that say the end game is (73:06 - 73:10)
better I'm sure it is but do you know (73:08 - 73:12)
how many people actually get to the end (73:10 - 73:14)
game not a lot you can see that with Sun (73:12 - 73:17)
and Moon everyone bought it two weeks (73:14 - 73:18)
later everyone stopped playing it except (73:17 - 73:20)
for the people who played the end game (73:18 - 73:22)
and you could say ah well it's end game (73:20 - 73:23)
is not good enough that doesn't matter (73:22 - 73:25)
there's such a small amount of people (73:23 - 73:27)
that play endgame anyway so that's why (73:25 - 73:29)
it doesn't matter instead of doing an (73:27 - 73:31)
end game it'll just put out a pokemon (73:29 - 73:33)
game every year where we're like we're (73:31 - 73:35)
sitting right now the only difference is (73:33 - 73:37)
they're gonna sell and make a net profit (73:35 - 73:40)
of like ten million dollars instead of (73:37 - 73:42)
putting all that time into an end game (73:40 - 73:44)
where they're not gonna get any more (73:42 - 73:46)
money and like two percent of people are (73:44 - 73:47)
actually going to play (73:46 - 73:52)
I got nothing on your rant here would I (73:47 - 73:56)
like to see red and blue remade sure (73:52 - 73:59)
would I like to see diamond and pearl (73:56 - 74:02)
eventually remade sure but you know what (73:59 - 74:05)
I would really like to see new games it (74:02 - 74:08)
still blows my mind how vocal that (74:05 - 74:11)
fanbase was for Omega Ruby alpha (74:08 - 74:13)
sapphire or for just for just Ruby and (74:11 - 74:15)
Sapphire remakes and as soon as they (74:13 - 74:18)
came out everyone shut up (74:15 - 74:19)
and then they moved on to Diamond and (74:18 - 74:23)
Pearl why why do we need to remake every (74:19 - 74:25)
single game unless there is a hardware (74:23 - 74:27)
elimination that is stopping you I don't (74:25 - 74:30)
think a remake make sure to exist I will (74:27 - 74:32)
I would be more accepting and more (74:30 - 74:36)
excited if Diamond and Pearl came out on (74:32 - 74:39)
something like a switch because then (74:36 - 74:42)
because right now I have a way to play (74:39 - 74:44)
diamond and pearl works on my 3ds just (74:42 - 74:45)
fine (74:44 - 74:47)
just like heartgold SoulSilver works on (74:45 - 74:50)
my 3ds just fine was there some value in (74:47 - 74:52)
Omega Ruby alpha sapphire yeah I guess (74:50 - 74:55)
because the 3ds didn't have a GBA slot (74:52 - 74:57)
so I guess that kind of makes sense in (74:55 - 75:00)
that in that way I'm just asking Pokemon (74:57 - 75:03)
fans to stop asking for remix and start (75:00 - 75:07)
asking for more new content but yes (75:03 - 75:09)
remakes I guess remakes fill in the gaps (75:07 - 75:11)
going back to the original point of this (75:09 - 75:13)
article yes I do think that every (75:11 - 75:15)
Pokemon game should be on Virtual (75:13 - 75:20)
Console here on out but Virtual Console (75:15 - 75:22)
is a mess and I'm sure if you bought (75:20 - 75:25)
them on Virtual Console and for some (75:22 - 75:26)
reason they release them on switch or (75:25 - 75:28)
they release them on some imaginary (75:26 - 75:31)
console that exists in the future those (75:28 - 75:32)
won't move over because nothing moves (75:31 - 75:34)
over the Nintendo doesn't know how to (75:32 - 75:36)
handle their digital purchases I hope (75:34 - 75:38)
you feel better for having let that out (75:36 - 75:40)
I do and maybe in a day or two they'll (75:38 - 75:43)
announce something at e3 that'll be (75:40 - 75:46)
exciting I want to say though I'm not (75:43 - 75:48)
upset about this direct it's fine it was (75:46 - 75:49)
good (75:48 - 75:51)
awesome we have more Pokemon games (75:49 - 75:53)
coming out this year I'm actually (75:51 - 75:56)
excited yeah gives us keeps us in (75:53 - 75:58)
business but we got something to talk (75:56 - 76:00)
about business of ranting whatever (75:58 - 76:02)
business it is that we're in I can't (76:00 - 76:04)
even tell most days I I want to know (76:02 - 76:06)
about I want to know more about Sunday (76:04 - 76:09)
moon ultra ultra Sun and ultra moon I (76:06 - 76:11)
want to know more about that I want to (76:09 - 76:12)
know what game freak's actually working (76:11 - 76:14)
on for switch I want to know what they (76:12 - 76:17)
show at e3 I would be curious that they (76:14 - 76:20)
updated Pokemon Bank in some way the (76:17 - 76:22)
Pokemon go news is really exciting (76:20 - 76:24)
really it's been a really great week for (76:22 - 76:25)
Pokemon stuff (76:24 - 76:28)
no no Pokemon shuffle too though that's (76:25 - 76:30)
what I was really holding out for was a (76:28 - 76:31)
joke (76:30 - 76:35)
well it fell flat alright good yeah (76:31 - 76:37)
anything else any anything else I missed (76:35 - 76:40)
I can't think of anything I just you (76:37 - 76:44)
know I'm hoping that for the month of (76:40 - 76:47)
June we haven't heard the last of new (76:44 - 76:48)
things coming from the Pokemon company (76:47 - 76:51)
International that is my hope I hope so (76:48 - 76:53)
too yeah I hope that more news continues (76:51 - 76:56)
