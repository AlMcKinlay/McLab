[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 269 episode of 2 6 9 of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host s BJ and with me today I have will and I'm overheating and I just told you I have no air conditioning and I don't know why you're putting me through this torture but I'm thrilled to be here you do not sound thrilled will I was just watching this I was just watching the EA coverage from e3 at e3 something like that and you know that thing yes and all right I'll let you know something here's a little tip during the 80s EA was my favorite game publisher during the 2017 I don't think they have a single game I'm interested in what happened to Electronic Arts they they they only care about their influencers gotta have all the influencers up there on stage we got a show for you guys today I'm just gonna it's just will and I Travis they are they were working all weekend and I have I had to have recorded this on I don't think that that's that's how you're supposed to say that sentence i recording this on saturday saturday instead of sunday just because of III and because i won't have enough time to both record and edit tomorrow so we're recording this early Travis couldn't be here just will and I very different show for you guys today I'm just gonna run it down real quick instead of doing our off-topic and then our Pokemon news and then spending a fair amount of time on one of those news articles and then jumping to emails and then doing Pokemon of the week we're just gonna do news this segment we're just gonna or this podcast we're just going to jump into news we're just gonna go through that and if III which is three days from now when we're recording this to day or one day when this episode goes up if a three presents something Pokemon related whether that's switch or 3ds or or mobile and it's substantial to Pokemon we will record again to touch on that but who knows they could they could show nothing the probably the main part of this podcast is going to be the Pokemon direct that happened on Tuesday yeah so we'll run through that we have some other bit of Pokemon news so we're just gonna dive right in and before we get to the Pokemon direct because that's kind of the big that's where we're gonna be spending most of our time let's talk about some other Pokemon news that happened this is right off Pokemon go live calm the official Pokemon go website celebrating the first Pokemon go anniversary Pokemon Niantic went ahead and announced Pokemon go fest before I read the article here will did you did you hear about this about the festival's yeah yeah because I made the comment that Milwaukee really messed up on that one didn't they they could have had thousands of people come with Milwaukee spending their dollars on restaurants accommodation transportation and guess how many dollars they're gonna make off Pokemon go zero lay awake mark could have had it all because you know that money is going right down to the Windy City Chicago yes I am I'm very if anything out of the past week news wise happened this is what I'm the most excited for I've talked about this for the last two weeks that I've been back on the Pokemon GO train choo choo I'm very excited for this let me just read the article here for those that might have missed it trainers we are celebrating two amazing milestones Pokemon goes one-year anniversary and 750 million global downloads and you're invited to join in on the fun over the next few months we are hosting real world and in-game events planned alongside some very exciting new

solstice solstice event Sol we will be hosting the soul rock event starting on June 13th 2017 this in-game event will feature fire-type and ice type Pokemon huge XP bonuses for throwing pokeballs accurately and discount in lucky eggs in the in-game shop soon thereafter you can look forward to a new update focused on collaborative gameplay features that will get you playing Pokemon go in fun new ways in preparation for these exciting features we will temporarily be disabling gyms for a short period of time so that that's for everyone that's really exciting we'll get to the second part here which is specifically for Chicago or people that are making the trip here we are also excited to announce our first ever real-world Pokemon go event I want to point out they said first-ever which means there's probably going to be more to come after this coming your way Pokemon go fest Chicago this event will take place in downtown Chicago Illinois USA at the beautiful Grant Park on July 22nd 2017 I'm gonna stop right there is Grant Park where the beam is is that the beam I've been to Chicago one for like 12 hours total in my entire life what's the beam now I know what the beam is please listeners don't write in I've seen had no interest in the beam okay it's a mirror I ate a fine house mirror AT&T paid for the beam I have AT&T they should have instead of buying a giant beam they should have put up a cell tower down there because the AT&T service is kind of atrocious is it really it's fine great T and T as well I've had a bad it was singular I think Grand Park Grant Park is is the beam pulling up here yeah Grant Park is next to Butler field it is also part of the beam the beam is called Cloud Gate I think is that right no why are you asking you I can't find a beam the beam is called Cloud Gate the mirrored beam shape sculpture in Grant Park it has the the pavilion where they have done music concerts before it has an ice-skating Club it has a Chicago tour area it has a Segway tour area it is next to the Art Institute of Chicago alright so the beans at Millennium Park stop with your confusion Asst okay but Millennium Park is across the street from Grant Park well that may still makes them two separate places but the Grant Park music where the pavilion is is in Millennium Park I wonder if okay let me just finish the article here all right all right all right I just looked at a map and you're right you are correct one for me well we'll take place at Grant Park on July 22nd join us as we celebrate Pokemon go the Pokemon go community with a ton a ton of exciting festivities tickets and more information for the Pokemon go fetch goggle will be available on Monday June 19th at 10 a.m. also that's when tickets will be available so mark your calendars and follow our social media channels to be notified when tickets go live european trainers can look forward to pokemon go celebrations hosted across the continent from June through September in a partnership with you you bail rod mokou shopping centers you probably got you guys know what that is I'm assuming we'll be posting a complete schedule of these events very soon also the Pokemon company is organizing Pikachu outbreak we reported it on this two episodes ago a Pokemon event in Yokohama Japan in August where they're exploring a unique Pokemon go experience stay tuned for more details surrounding each of these events in the coming week so we got a couple things here I think the fire and ice type event we don't have to spend much time on we're just gonna see more fire pokemon more ice type pokemon you're gonna get an XP boost when you're throwing pokeballs accurately I'm assuming that's the accurately would be the spinning motion that you can do the curveball discount in lucky eggs in the game shop so if you're planning on playing Pokemon go all summer you might want to stock up on those what do lucky eggs get you in Pokemon go they give you a 30 minutes XP boost I think the big takeaway from this though is they're gonna be they're gonna be disabling gyms for a short period of time that's all gyms Yantic did come out on reddit and say that your Pokemon at the gyms will be returned to you so all gyms will be empty after the gym update happens there's no word on what the gym update is going to be but they do say before that there will be a collaborative group gameplay feature that will get you playing Pokemon go and fun new ways I wonder if they're kind of doing something with when they showed in the original trailer I don't know if you remember that where everyone was in Times Square catching Mewtwo I do remember that I wonder if it's gonna be something like that hmm I mean it will be something like that but like is a very broad and right Pacific word because you can help somebody else taking a gym that's already there's already some collaboration there in in that aspect how do you feel about this Pokemon go event I feel I feel like the Internet is very upset that it's one city and they may be upset if they live in like California or New York and Chicago is not a very easy place to get to and maybe that's why I am so excited because I am only an hour away I mean Chicago's not that hard to get to they've got two airports but my concern is I mean there there's a common ship to the tickets cost no price Oh the tickets are free no no they haven't said ah see now the problem is right what if it's like an exclusive Pokemon and I have to explain to my nephew that he'll never have like Mewtwo because not only could we not afford the airfare to go to Chicago we couldn't afford the $50.00 for two tickets to Pokemon go festival right and they don't they haven't implemented trading yet as far as I'm aware that's true so I have a I have a couple thoughts about that so you make an excellent point right if I'm in California and I and Nene antic already has said that there will be there will be legendary Pokemon this summer we don't know if that's one we don't know if that's two we don't know we just know that we're supposed to at least get one legendary Pokemon this summer I kind of was under the mindset why would they do the first legendary Pokemon in one city behind a paywall because if you look at past events at Grant Park that Park has a limit cap of 12,000 people which is a lot it is a lot that's a lot that's it's a big park if not only can only 12,000 people go to this or maybe less depending what the festivities are they haven't said what's what what's actually going to happen here there there's a paywall to get in whether that's $20 or $40 or who knows how much it's gonna cost to get in they'll probably do the the standard Pokemon thing they always do where it's like yeah it's $40 to get in but we're gonna give you a t-shirt and here's three booster packs and I can't imagine that I can't imagine tcpi isn't very directly evolved into this even though it's neon takes event but tcp/ip is very controlling its neon takes event so a yeah but they can't force them to give stuff away they can't they can't influence the profit margin here but whatever go I could or they they could they could say hey we're gonna we're gonna make the shirts but Bob if it that that doesn't matter your point of what if they do do a legendary pokemon here I think I think everyone would be not everyone I think the people at the event would be very excited and very happy everyone else would be very upset but at the same time I can't get far fetched without traveling to another country this is true I can't get mr. mime without going to Europe I can't get kangaskhan without going to Australia once that's put in perspective I can totally see them going all right here's the Aptos it's only in Chicago only at this event no I I can see that I agree I just I think a lot of people it's like it's kind of like you you you put a little crack into the armor and then that's what people are gonna chisel away at to kind of break in and it's like mmm right even though yes everybody's aware mr. mime is only in Europe and you know that far fetch is only in Japan or whatever like that doesn't have that additional little piece of the paywall love having to have a ticket and it's like almost like well I could have done this but you put it out of my reach not in a game play kind of fashion but like in a real world dollars fashion so I mean that's where I can see people getting annoyed again I do I I'm not on either side of the fence like I can totally see them doing this I can totally see them not doing this but I feel like they would do this just based on these region-specific Pokemon on top of if they're actually releasing legendary Pokemon like let's say Mewtwo is at Chicago everyone there I I don't even know how the caching aspect works like just just Mewtwo running away from some people just does everyone catch them how let's just say that the 12,000 people that are there they all walk away with Mewtwo mu-2 would actually probably be one of the rarest Pokemon in Pokemon go whereas if they put Mewtwo at every McDonald's for just a Saturday you would then be saying that far fetch or Kangaskhan or mr. mime you would be saying that those Pokemon are rarer than your legendary now I agree with that and I was you know I'm thinking that it's kind of like how the original mute distribution happened where you know you had to go to a specific place and hope that they still had Musa vailable to distribute I mean there wasn't a cost involved but it certainly you know required more than your typical Pokemon collecting effort in order to accomplish it but my one thing like the when I've been thinking about this the one thing that I kind of frame it in my head that I think might be acceptable is similar to back when destiny was first launching and I think it was PAX West they had like if you were at PAX West you could get the black Smith armor yes English yeah the shader and like that was the only way you could get the shader but then like a year later they're like oh here everybody can have the black Smith shader so it's like it was special for a period of time but then they just made it more generally available I said and I think that's okay I think that's yeah I think that's okay too I mean you're buying your six months of I have Mewtwo and nobody else does and I mean you also get to bunt hang out with a bunch of Pokemon go playing nerds yeah Chicago the worst city on earth I I will I will be there I I plan on buying tickets I plan on I'm being there I'm assuming tickets are gonna sell very fast I'm not sure how much they're gonna cost my guess is they're gonna be 40 that would be that would be my guess free no I don't I don't think free at all did you say 40 40 40 f40 that would before hmm too much do you think so yeah now it's got to be 25 to 30 I would say 40 but you're getting something you're getting like a swag bag when you walk in that would be a swag bag with a fidget spinner in it I mean these people they got to make money this is this is like West Coast elites thinking like looking down on Mid America and they're like oh we're gonna take these people for all their cash and make $30 off a profit off of it a $10 ticket I have no faith in Niantic stability to not be greedy but my guess would be that they're gonna do the Chicago event there I the more I think about the fact that there are regions specific Pokemon the more I am convincing myself that they're gonna do a legendary here it just doesn't make sense to make your legendary easier to get than a far-fetched it just let me ask you this how would you feel if they don't do a legendary because they're gonna save that for some worldwide event on their anniversary this doesn't happen on the anniversary does it this is this is the anniversary yeah this is their one okay hmm I was I was and say what if they don't do a legendary and instead they make any Pokemon that are not typically available in that region available in that location on that time so yeah I wanted to talk about that excellent transition will if you look at the Pokemon go fest picture I would I would assume that a intern didn't make the graphic for this image because there's very specific things that are happening in the Pokemon and in the image itself so you see Charizard you see Venus or you see Blastoise you have your Pikachu of Butterfree you have Snorlax and then on top of Snorlax you have larvae tar and then behind larvae tar you see a merrill and a togepi and then above Blastoise you see an unknown and then if you look behind Charizard and there's a bunch of polka stops - you see hair across hair across is a region specific Pokemon you cannot get hair across in America so why would they put hair across in this image in Chicago because obviously in the background of this image is is what's supposed to look like Chicago why would they do that unless they're putting regions but they're letting the people who come to Chicago for this event get a chance to get Kangaskhan and and mr. mime and heracross and stuff like that or maybe they just did it because heracross is a really popular Gentoo pokemon no I can't imagine they did it because of that I feel like this is so I feel like this is really they're teasing something here so it okay let me back up if they do a legendary Pokemon at Chicago cool I'm not going to be upset even if I wasn't going I wouldn't be upset because I think the legendary Pokemon need to be rarer than the region specific Pokemon and so if they do do it I get it I understand it and I totally get that people will be upset about that if they do not do it again I don't really care they're eventually gonna do it I'm sure they're gonna make it difficult or or it's it's not like Mewtwo's just gonna spawn in your backyard I'm assuming that you have to physically go somewhere to do it whether that's gonna be we're gonna do me to a tall target so we're gonna do me two at Starbucks Azure or Walmart's there's going to be some sort of travel slash event holding it if they do regional Pokemon if they say hey at the Chicago vet we're gonna do heracross and we're gonna do far fetch and we're gonna do kangaskhan I might actually like that better because I have zero plans to travel like maybe in the next year or two I will go to Japan but there's no way in the next year or two I'm gonna go to Europe Japan and Australia especially just to get one Pokemon in Pokemon go and I saw that some people were kind of like no they shouldn't do that region Pokemon should be region specific why not have them at the Chicago event once they introduced trading none of that matters like when I was at PAX in Seattle last year I met these amazing people from Australia and if they were playing Pokemon go I'm sure they would have enough Kangaskhan to give me and I could easily give them a tourist like that situation is slowly going to start to close itself like yeah it's going to be still hard to get a kangaskhan because you're gonna have to meet somebody that goes to Australia but I think that's and you have to meet them in person because I believe the the rumor was trading has to be person to person or like in person to in person but the hair cross has to mean something it has I can't I can't imagine out of the 240 some Pokemon 230 some Pokemon that are available in Pokemon go they would make that mistake of Oh actually hair cross isn't in America just stop trying to national treasure this one picture your let's let's go even deeper well Nicolas Cage let's go even deeper so above hair across is another unknown I don't have the sources in front of me but I'm pretty sure unknown is the hardest Pokemon defying in Pokemon go it has the high the lowest spawn rate or whatever so if you see unknown it's the rarest and I'm pretty sure Tyranitar is the second hardest Pokemon to find in Pokemon go which was why I think it's interesting that they show a larva tar on top of Snorlax but that's just going down another rabbit hole so the unknown above heracross is the exclamation mark unknown which will I bet you know that was introduced in Gen 3 I didn't know that the expo mate I actually didn't know that until we could go because you know unknown is not on the front of my mind all the time the exclamation mark unknown and the question mark unknown were introduced in Gen 3 so where where are you seeing this image because I'm looking at an image on the specific site and I do not see any you know Ann's oh I see the hair cross okay it's right above the hair cross it's really faint yeah it's like almost like we're trying to hide almost like that it's there they're teasing something it's almost like they're teasing something my guess would be that the Chicago event will have the first legendary and the Chicago event and/or the Chicago event will have region specific Pokemon and then my guess is come this fall they're going to release gen 3 so after they fix the gyms and I'm assuming they're gonna do trading but between that and and gen3 all we can do is assume and speculate yeah till it actually happens and it's fun and it's an and we'll probably be wrong and that's okay but hey we we talked about it at least so well we'll have more details soon this event isn't until July 22nd tickets go on sale we'll have one more podcast before tickets at least one more podcast before tickets go on sale so oh and then we'll have like four weeks after tickets go on sale to continue to talk about this but we'll do that when the when the time comes Apple had a keynote this week the only reason I bring up this is Apple had their WWDC keynote they talked about Pokemon go slightly and then they kind of went in and talked about their AR kit which is the augmented reality platform that Pokemon go uses this is off polygons I just want to read a little bit of this we don't have to spend much time talking about this I just think this is interesting in Pokemon gos viewpoint when Pokemon go launched last year on Android and iOS it revolutionized the way people think about games on a phone Pokemon go became a craze that didn't die down until later that fall for many it was a look into the power of AR technology that could do for an average smartphone user first for Apple it was the first piece of software that the company saw a profitable means of development and helped to reinforce the entire sector of the company during the 2016 investor call Apple CEO Tim Cook was asked about the success of Pokemon go Cook said by the third week of July the game had more downloads than any other app in the company's history according to Apple Cook said that it was a promising statistic and proved that AR can be really great quote we have been and continued to invest in AR in the long run Cook said we'll we'll see whether it's the next computing platform but regardless it will be huge during the most recent during WWDC presentation Apple showed off a number of ways AR kit can be used in applications and games that we'll run through it front and center was a better version of Pokemon go that will remain exclusive to the i phone paired with Apple's newest iOS iOS 11 they then showed some other games regarding Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson studio blah blah blah and yes they go more in depth about AR but if you are an iOS Pokemon go player the AR experience will be much better as soon as iOS 11 comes out which is scheduled this fall why are they making me wait so long I mean don't most people just turn off the AR part yeah cuz it makes it harder to catch pokemon it's well that and it destroys your battery it uses so much battery power when it's on which which but you use the iPhone with the small battery yeah I have the tiny iPhone alright what I don't I mean I have the big iPhone so I have no battery concern to the big iPhone one more news article here before we get to the Nintendo or the Pokemon direct Magikarp jump fishes up a lot of new content with a new update this is off comicbook.com Magikarp jump released its first big update today which added a surprising amount of new content than the game in addition to raising the maximum player and Magikarp levels Magikarp jump also added the heal League as a new place for players to test their magic carpet jumping ability after beating the heal League players can find six new types of Magikarp with a brown and apricot skin colors in addition to new support Pokemon were added to the game greninja will give your Magikarp a massive amount of JP which is jump power while getting Gengar will give your Magikarp a 50% boost to all JP game for a minute after it's activated also added where two new decorations one is automatically earned by beating the heal League two new food options and two new types of high-level training and that's it's pretty much it you still play you still play in the jump I mean typically I only play when we record on Sundays so I mean we already recordings are that boring that you need I mean well it says more about Magikarp jump that you know it doesn't take that much thought so it's like you're just kind of poking at the screen there's not a lot of decisions to me I did lose a Magikarp too Pidgeot and that was disappointing but now it just doesn't hold my interest I've got you like I'm playing Pokemon son I'm still playing Monster Hunter I'm doing a little crochet project here and there I got lots of stuff to fill my time I don't know if are you still playing shuffle nope are you still playing Rumble world no and I don't I can't play pick cross anymore either because the final puzzles that I have left take too long and it's just like an amount of time that I don't have to available to set aside doing a big cross puzzle but you played those slow and steady for months very much like I play monster hunter now one monster to kill every day I feel like Magikarp jump is fits your criteria of it's free its Pokemon you can play it for a long time and I'll put money into it you can do it for example every morning or every night all right I might consider come back to me next week look I'm not trying to convince you if you've persuaded me I'm not trying to convince you I just feel like I mean you are at you are 100% of right that it is pretty mindless not that engaging i I tone down my magic harp jump I now usually just play when I wake up I play when I'm eating a lunch and then I play right before I go to bed just because you hit the you hit all your Pokemon resets your Papa Leo is in your slow pokes and your Rawat's got to reset them all all right let's get to the I have so much to say about this Pokemon direct of course right I don't want to get ahead of myself so first I'll read I'll read the official press release that tcpi sent me and then we'll we'll go from there Pokemon is making its way to the Nintendo switch later this year with pokken tournament DX along with all the content from both the Wii U and the arcade versions of pokken tournament the Pokemon fighting game where pokemon in battle move in direct response to player's actions pokemon tournament DX also introduces our array of new exciting features to create the ultimate poking experience pokemon tournament DX features include play pokemon anytime anywhere i'm attendance which played in TV mode handheld mode or share a joy con with another trainer to battle them in one-on-one in tabletop mode anywhere brand-new fighter just did UI enters the battle alongside alongside all previous pokemon from the Wii U and the arcade versions the arcade version had like dark cry and stuff that wasn't in the Wii U version remember when we got that really angry email that we were wrong that all the arcade Pokemon were on the Wii U disc and we were it was unbelievable that they would remake it for switch it doesn't matter that there on the disc they're not gonna unlock them yep no I agree well I mean it happened of course why would they not remake this game and make more money a new support pokemon Litton and pop leo make their debut to lend their support in battle team mode battle pick three pokemon and battle it out the first to defeat all of your opponent's Pokemon and win this new battle mode group match mode find similarly skilled players in Bower room for intense and fun battles online daily challenges complete a variety of daily challenges watch battle replays hone your skills by watching other players replays and share your best matches online with the replay feature and finally jump straight into the battle all characters and support Pokemon will be available right from the start of the game pokken tournament DX will launch on attendance which September 22nd 2017 so let's stop there let's worry about the other news later this was an 8 minute direct 5 of those minutes 6 of those minutes were dedicated to this game yeah this is not a new tactic by Pokemon no no I do want to point out though that all the games they showed none of them were new they were all just enhanced versions or old versions of games that have existed yeah I mean the point of the poke in the portion of it that featured it was a discussion of pokin or sort of a I don't know display what do you want to call that the ad for pokken was the fact that the dude was like traveling through all of these different situations and he was able to play pokken in whatever situation he was in it's all just lie down it's almost like the nitendo switch is like a handheld console kind of it's almost like they tried to tell that story and they have been telling that story in every single switch commercial no one's playing at home I don't want again I don't get my ahead of myself but you're this guy plays pokken everywhere outside he plays at a restaurant he plays at a broken train he plays in a park and then when he gets to his house you see people playing a 3ds inside their home shouldn't it be the other way around if Linda temple switches this home console shouldn't they be playing at home and the people with the DS's should be outside I just thought it was wrong I just thought that was funny the big boys play the switch the little boys play the three oh I see that's what that's what that was that was the story I am NOT planning on buying pokken for the switch well no because I could beat you at pokken for the WiiU and that would continue and you will not play any game that I can beat you it will retired me from poked and tournament exactly I'm not big on fighting games I think pokin is is cool I think there are better fighting games if I was to play a fighting game pokken has the appeal of Pokemon but there are other fighting games that I have enjoyed more in the past like like Soul Calibur for example I think it makes a lot of sense that they're making this game again since it didn't have an opportunity to really shine on Wii U and I think we're gonna see this with more games I would not be surprised at e3 if we see Super Smash Brothers DX just like we saw Mario Kart DX or deluxe Oh 100% like the last like 1.5 years of the Wii U is just going to be replicated on the switch right heck we're gonna get what's the witch game Bayonetta we're gonna get paying at a switch I think so yeah I think so too and I think that's fine those games were made they didn't sell as well as they could because of the hardware it was on I think that's all fine and that's why we were so confident that those old characters in pokken weren't going to come because they're putting their efforts through here I think what this speaks more of though is the Nintendo's switch competitive viewpoint that they're really pushing if you look at splatoon and you look at arms and now you look at pokin these are all extremely competitive games that they are pushing all summer and I think that's interesting none of those games I am a fan of I think if I was the pick out of the three splatoon would be the one that would most garnish my attention even with all these new features I played 30 or so hours of pokin and I feel like I got my my fill of that game well and I mean yeah I mean splatoon for you because you love FPS is but yeah I just I Wow I mean what it's hard to say right I can't say that I need a story for me to be able to enjoy a game because boy I do enjoy the heck out of Monster Hunter and no stories minimal store I mean you get you can read the little dialogues and kind of put pieces together of what's happening to certain people and PCs and such but it's just like that battle arena just mmm now I the I guess the skills that you have to develop it's that's not what brings enjoyment for me I dunno I mean I have a friend who like literally the only video games that he plays are fighting games and like that is his jam it is I just can't comprehend it it doesn't speak to me so yeah I don't know I mean Empoleon is cool but I mean I have an employee on in living pokedex so there you go I think the the whole presentation of that was fantastic though like that commercial or whatever you want to call it made me excited for pokken well it kind of made me wanna travel the world and have fun and then I realized I'm too old to stay in hostels so that's not gonna happen I wonder if pokin will get more after this and I say that because there is a big push for arms and they said you know all future content will be free we're gonna add more arms we're gonna add more characters we're gonna add more arenas and they said the same exact thing for splatoon we're gonna add more guns we're gonna add more modes we're gonna add more arenas and pokken is now on that on that pillar of these three games are your summer competitive games so I wonder if they're gonna do the same for pokken I think pokken suffers from a smaller roster my complaint and I don't know if other people share this my complaint is I didn't like the 3d from the back into like a 2d space yeah the that conversion and the yet hmm and and your your moves were different in that 3d space than they were in the 2d space and the 2d space is still 3d don't get me wrong but it was 3d as the way Tekken was 3d of okay we're in 3d but we're consistently looking at each other and we can sidestep clearly pokken is based on Tekken just look at the names and pokken is made by Namco Bandai so this clear we know Game Freak is working on a switch game we know pokken isn't it because Game Freak doesn't make pokum so that kind of clears up that that area but if there was a mode in the game that was just like hey we're just gonna do the we're just gonna do the Tekken stuff and not that open 3d stuff I would actually probably be down to buy that version or at least have that mode in the game because I just didn't like that view swap well and you also have to learn a different control mechanic when it swaps right it actually changes your your guard hit and all that biz so yeah I mean obviously I did not get it drawn in by poking tournament I only got it so that I could beat you and I only beat you by like spamming the a buttons yo and then $60 well forget $60 well spent was my overwatch [Laughter] all right so during the pokin commercial we get to the two little boys in the house papa brother or whoever that was brought the kids three DS games I've read the press release here during the pokemon direct viewers also saw first footage from the newest titles in the Pokemon series pokemon ultra Sun and Pokemon ultramoon two new Pokemon forms are shown resembling that of the legendary Pokemon Sol Gallio and new Lu Nala pokemon ultra Sun and Pokemon moon have been powered up with new additions to the story and features from Pokemon Sun and Pokemon and Moon Pokemon ultra Sun and ultra Moon are scheduled to be released worldwide on November 17th more information about the games will be revealed later this year what are your thoughts I have a lot to say but so my fundamental thoughts are a yes so obviously something in line with black and white - do you think this is black and white - or do you think this is platinum because I would say there's no net net net net it platinum but by saying something in line with black and white - I mean the fact that it's a fusion of necrosha and whatever legendary oh the crowd yes they're not even hinting at that they're like almost saying it explicitly that that is like the core of the game it is ya know it's platinum it is Pokemon Sun and Moon you get different clothes you get a little bucket hat that's real cute different kind of shorts but you're going to basically be following the same story path with adjustments so maybe it's like team skull and the other ether foundation are swapped that I don't know I I didn't get to play platinum so right the end goal is going to be different there's going to be some some changes along the line so that the ending comes out different but it's not going to be like five years later here's what's happening in a Lola and and that kind of in advance that's that's super important right there because based off the verbage they've used in Pokemon very specific they're very detailed when it comes to the verbage they used the press releases they send out the trailers they show when you look at platinum or emerald or crystal they were more or less the same stories with minor changes some additions some extra content when you look at black and white to that game yes it said in the same generation but that game is set five years later from the first story they're telling an all-new story to the point where Sharon and Bianca are older and they're guiding you in a totally different way than they they were and will you can speak to the changes more than I can since generation 5 is your favorite but black white 2 was not just an addition no and there was literally a component of the game where you could import some of the save information from pokemon black and white so that as you're going through the story of black and white two people have memories of what your protagonist in black and white did as part of the story flashbacks and such like that if this was if this was a full sequel like black and white 2 they would have said so like they did with black and white to the the very first press released that black and white 2 sent out honed in on an entirely new story and they didn't really say much more until a later date yeah I mean you started in a different town and you followed a whole different path - well until you gotten to the point where the paths crossed but I mean it was definitely a different game and I mean just like there's like hints about similarities to black and white - obviously colbus is very visible in sorry spoilers for a game that's been out for 7 months now but he's very visible in a Lola so that was like your kind of indication that there would be some kind of Pokemon fusion type DNA splicers deal going on and he wasn't just there to hand out the pieces but I mean we'll see it's just yeah it's gonna be enhancement obviously they've shown new screen footage so there's new cutscenes and probably some new areas that you'll go to but I thought the PSU area which is a new area that would fall under new additions um yeah it's I think it's like an alternate telling of the same story that informs the original story it expands enough in a way so that we will have more information about what was really happening in Pokemon Sun and Moon like what what is going on with Mon you know why does he like not care about his children and family maybe some more information about the ultra wormholes in the relationship between ultra beasts and Pokemon since obviously they can be captured and stored just like Pokemon and eat berries and beans and such so I mean it's it's gonna give us more information on that so it's going to be a more a fuller game but not to the point where you're going to be learning a new a whole new story ya know and you know at team skull and the other foundation aren't gonna swap team skull are still gonna be lunkheads I would be amazed and pleased if they do something to change the presentation of team skull because obviously we didn't see any team skull in this teaser trailer right yeah they didn't appear at all we just saw the protagonist character's new clothes and some new cutscenes they could possibly fix some of the issues that people had with team skull but its Japan let's address some some things do you think new mega Pokemon no mega Pokemon this is not the generation for Megas so do you think new alow landforms I would strongly suspect that since that was one of my most disappointing parts of black and white to that yes there will be new a little informs I think so too possibly in new areas that you have to go to or you know new areas that you come across that that's where you'll find them which I hope would be the case because that makes more logic it's a more logically consistent universe if you do that anyway I would hope that the next bit of news we'll talk about which is gold and silver coming to the Virtual Console that that's a sign that we will get generation 2 a lowland forms I don't want any more generation one of low informs I think if they're going to stick with that formula all Pokemon across all generations can have mega forms but not everyone I hope that it's all Pokemon across every generation can have alternative forms but not everyone so I hope that we do get some generation to 11 forms I think that would be great do you think it's too soon ah I think possibly because of some other things that we've discussed which I don't know if you want to talk about or not that probably no it is not too soon okay I have some numbers here these numbers are just averages you know if I'm if I'm if I'm Way off please let me know but from red and green to yellow this is weird too because not every Pokemon game has had worldwide releases like Japan got certain games way before us or sometimes it was only three months before us but I'm saying red and green not red blue so from red and green to yellow there was 31 months in between so over two years little less than three years is a better way to say that okay that's fair and I wouldn't say that yellow is that dramatically different than then red green or blue you they added the Pikachu followed you it was easier to get the three starters they added Team Rocket at certain points but for this for the same for all intents and purposes did I say that right in ten that is correct yes it's the same story so 31 months between those games from gold and silver to crystal 19 months from Ruby and Sapphire to emerald 23 months from diamond and pearl to platinum 2 years 24 months from black and white to black and white to 20 months from Sun and Moon to ultra Sun and Moon 12 months I mean they're they're getting better at programming Congrats not even not even a full year I'm pretty sure that Sunday moon came out on November 18th and these games are coming out on November 17th 364 days not even a full year I've said this before I don't want my Pokemon games to be Call of Duty I don't want a Pokemon game ever mayne serious pokemon game every year sure give me your pokemon shuffles in between give me your mystery dungeons in between give me something to hold me over but I think it's really special to have a main series game and I'm not saying I won't play ultra son an ultra moon I just worry that there will be burnout for some people well that was like me playing Omega Ruby where I had like literally very recently played emerald and I was like wow this story over again they're gonna have to really wow me to to impress me with obviously I'm gonna play it but for me to put some real interest in it especially also cuz I just started playing Pokemon son so if I take my leisurely time getting through that I may just be finishing that up when ultra son ultra moon come out it was it wasn't even a week or so ago I was considering playing Pokemon moon just because I didn't really want to do anything more and son like yeah I could get ultra beast but I kind of wanted to I kind of wanted to go through the story again at a slower pace since I played through that game so fast too that is exactly what I'm doing but now but now that they announced this why bother well so I mean the one other recommendation I could make for you that's really keeping me having fun now playing Pokemon Sun is I have built like the most unrealistic for the newcomer to a Lola team I like I don't think oh I haven't been make you on there but it's like a lot of Gen 5 Pokemon and another Pokemon that I all hatched from eggs and it's like why why is Darumaka available on the first island and like my starter so that makes it fun for me okay let's address the elephant in the room here these games are on 3ds they are not on Nintendo switch supposedly I feel the same way anywhere you look there's gonna be debate about this whether that's reddit Twitter Facebook our slack community this was a huge topic of conversation these games got announced for 3ds they did not a get announced for switch so far so far let's back up why did everyone think they were gonna be announced for switch on November 17th 2016 Eurogamer started all of this they reported that Game Freak was working on a third version of Pokemon Sun and Moon that was codenamed never the final name just codenamed stars that was the really the one and only rumor that we ever got about this I think it I think it's safe to say that there was a lot of trust put into that rumor based on what Eurogamer reported on before which was a week to two weeks before the Nintendo switch came out they got the price right they got the screen right they got the date right they got everything right about the Nintendo switch so then after the Nintendo switch press conference happened Sun and Moon came out they reported on Starz it's hard to say they're just lying about this when clearly they got a lot right just a month ago about the new tennis switch when we all started playing Pokemon Sun and Moon it was night and day you instantly noticed this the slowdown that happened you noticed right away that hey they're not really doing anything with the bottom screen you notice that they removed the PBS system the upscaling oh and then the the big upscaling thing that happened where people who dumped the ROM on a computer saw how good-looking this game could be like wow they put a lot of effort and time into these sprites for a system that handle it at all so you haven't can't resolve them accurately right see sufficiently you have those points of actually playing the game and seeing all these kind of odd choices that happened and you have the Eurogamer rumor on top of don't forget that Game Freak has been confirmed working on and attend a switch game then it's not pokin we know it's not pokin so that's where this all all this built from and then they went ahead and they said hey this is going to be on the 3ds and it's going to be on the switch to be determined and then everyone said oh it is gonna be on the switch you just didn't say what your trailer the press release said on the switch to be determined yes and then create the original press release then Kotaku reached out to them and they replied woops sorry we messed up nope nope not gonna be on switch exclusively 3ds not going to be on switch don't know how that got into the press release for a company that is so dedicated to controlling their message whether that's through text whether that's through Twitter whether that's through a eight-minute direct how did they mess that up how did they put out a press release and say that this 3ds game is also going to be on the Nintendo switch and then ten minutes later go whoops that was a mistake um carelessness the person who was in charge of that press release was overworked and underpaid and a little tired at the end of the day and they just took the monster hunter press release and swapped out the main text look I don't I don't at the end of the day I don't care I would be very excited and I would buy a switch version if that's the case if that's what they show at e3 awesome I don't think anyone doubted for a second that it wasn't also going to be on 3ds there are 66 million 3ds out there there are only three million switches out there I'm rounding up yeah I was gonna say I agree with you if it can be on both it will be on both that's how you sell more copies if it's not on the switch then what is Game Freak working on if it's not on the switch why did that press release have that mistake if it's not on the switch what was your gamer talking about if it's not on the switch then why does the game run so poorly I still do not buy for a second that the number one best-selling handheld game throughout all these years maybe Tetris beats it I'm not sure but Pokemon is the second biggest franchise in the world following Mario and that game runs like garbage on the new Nintendo 3ds on the system that they put out a four to copper to make up for the six year old piece of hardware they made a better system with a better processor that could run games better and this game does not run better it runs like garbage well in your opinion I think you're a little too critical I don't really unless I'm looking for it I don't really notice these things but you tend to be more critical about these things than I do I mean it didn't stop me from playing it when you look back or when you look at show pieces for your sister system and you and pokemons gonna be up there with Mario Cart of like these were the games that carried the 3ds it's just kind of weird that of the games that carried the 3ds didn't run great on the three I want to talk about the switch as a handheld so let's say ultra sudden ultra moon also for example before I before I start this rant I will say that I'm going to play ultra 17 ultramoon I am excited because I do want to go back to a Lola what I am the most curious about that probably no one else is thinking about is are they going to include those pokemon gold ribbons in ultra Sun and ultra moon because we we were told that go was supposed to transfer to Sun and Moon there are the little icons in the game that say that this Pokemon is from Pokemon go I want to know if those ribbons still exist in the new game because I want to know if they have given up on that or if they're still working on that I don't know that's just something I care about personally okay back to the switch with all this debate of oh I wish it was diamond and pearl or I wish it was stars on switch or I wish it was this I wish it was that the thing I kind of see that happens between these conversations is why would the Pokemon company put Pokemon on a console that is a home console and I'm sick of hearing that that argument do you really do people really think that there's going to be a four DS or there's going to be a new game boy or I why wouldn't it Tendo do that why would you make a portable system when the switch exists with a slightly smaller screen and what a worse processor why the 3ds came out six years ago and launched with steel diver it's not like it had a good library when it launched and then all of us got did it launched actually didn't launch at 250 and then we all got ambassador programs because they apologized that's all that's what I was just going to say is that the the switch is gonna drop by $100 by probably December of this year oh no no not to make sure that it's long enough I wouldn't say it well you're up I would say they would put in one to two games before they drop it they're okay they're gonna stick like mario carton and I don't know splatoon one or something there not gonna ambassador program that because they lost some money on that I've got those sweet sweet original Mario games and Zelda games because of that so which launches at $2.99 3ds originally launched at 250 what possible hand held could they release that wouldn't eat the switches lunch or vice versa the switch is just gonna eat its lunch I have a quote from the Sudha that I think is very important and I think well hopefully our listeners end this conversation about Pokemon being on quote unquote a home console because watch any trailer with the switch the switch is always outside the switch is always on a train the switch is in a park at a party it's never just it might end or start in somebody's home but the switch is a portable console it is the handheld if anything was to blow my mind it would be Nintendo releasing another handheld and trying to have both that and the switch on the market here's a quote from Masuda from kotaku 2015 quote there are different types of people out there people who want to play at home at their own pace and really just enjoy the world and people who want to play with other players and meet them in real life what I've always said about the reason why we put Pokemon on the handheld system is the handheld system allows you to do both you can play at your own pace at home but you can also meet with other people and I think that's the power of Pokemon is the power of communication Pokemon brings people together and I really like that element which is why we continue to put them out on handhelds but there are a lot of people who want a home console version we know especially with internet features that let people battle and trade but the way that handhelds allow people to come together if we could figure out how to make that happen on consoles it would be an option on the future but right now that's just not possible if you've ever been in an audience of the Pokemon World Championships that's my ideal for Pokemon all these people gathering together and playing with each other if there were a way a console could enable that it might be an option but right now handheld it is and quote where was that quote from time date and where was it printed that was January 27th 2015 on Kotaku UK 2015 interesting date it was right after it was after X&Y because they talked about X and while possibly at a time when he would be aware of the development of a new device called this new Tendo switch which is it it has to be it and this isn't even a conversation if ultra moon and ultra Sun doesn't come to switch I think at that point it's irrelevant if it doesn't come to switch fine let them sell there however melon however many millions of copies on the 3ds because there are 66 million 3ds is out there but I think the conversation starts and ends at eventually we are getting a full Pokemon game on switch there's no way another main series game is coming to 3ds or they stopped making Pokemon games altogether yeah that would probably be the best outcome really I think that quote though is probably the most important thing though that we've said in the last hour I know I think so I think that that's very telling I think that the time at when he would have said that at a time where he might have knowledge of the plans to have the switch where he could say ok I'm aware of this I can't say anything about it directly but boy this actually meets directly with the vision that I have for this game so I'm gonna Telegraph that this is coming in two to three years and and if they announced Ultra Sun and ultra moon at e3 on switch which I think would be fantastic only because that's where I would prefer to play it Monster Hunter cross has already shown us it is possible to play and tray or not trade but play between a switch and a 3ds this would be a good way of giving switch owners something to play like hey I'm not into I'm not into fighting games I'm not into third-person shooters I'm not into fighting games the first fighting game was pokin the second fighting game was armed I want a story based adventure all my friends were playing Pokemon this might be a good opportunity because the switch doesn't have a lot of stuff right now to get into that and still be able to play with 3ds owners still be able to transfer my Pokemon up if monster hunter can transfer game data between a switch and a 3ds which it which we learned two weeks ago that it can then we know something like Pokemon bank would work well also the my two things that I would have to contribute to this are one I believe the Pokemon cartridges used to have built in the method of communicating for doing the local wireless link trades this may be completely wrong but I think at one point they did because the two DS did not support that so they built it into the cartridge to support it so for the people saying all right you can't do caught cross-platform between a 3ds and a switch maybe they can build that into the cartridges so that it'll do the cross pat platform based on the cartridge number one number two it is now however many days after the original announcement and the website Pokemon Sun Moon calm whatever its like empty all it shows is the Nick rhizoma forms of the legendaries it doesn't show the new trainers it doesn't even show as much as that trailer showed so they're waiting for something else to come where it's going to be like a big glut of information to make that website something real I mean that's at least my point of view the Pokemon direct obviously happened a week before e3 because I don't think what they would have announced at e3 I think what if they announced what they did at e3 it would have got lost in the shuffle they announced that 3 there was also another issue that I saw that coro coro is going to publish before the e3 Nintendo date so they wanted to get in front of that ok but when you're when you're looking at when when all eyes are on III a lot of stuff can get lost especially when you know big games like Oh a God of war game is coming back or Last of Us 2 or 1 verse 100 on Xbox which I think they should bring back that would make me buy an Xbox but if Nintendo was to spend 8 minutes of their direct showing 3 rehashes of old games that would have gotten completely lost but if they get up on stage at e3 and they just show switch game switch game switch game switch game switch game and one of those switch games is ultra Sun and ultra moon now that's not going to get lost in the shuffle that's not going to upset 3ds owners right off the bat because they got their news they got everything they're satisfied for everything they show at the e3 stage is to get people wanting to buy a switch whereas announcing it wouldn't make sense to announce that at a Pokemon direct because that news is big enough at e3 to make it matter so we're just gonna announce the 3ds version here well now it's a switch version here and if there is no switch version that's fine that's still going back to what I said earlier ok so what is Game Freak working on and - we're gonna get a Pokemon game eventually so if it's not switch then I will welcome a new generation or something else instead I think that's all very well said last bit of news here is also announced the second titles in the Pokemon series pokemon gold and silver will be making their way to the Nintendo 3ds Virtual Console pokemon gold and silver were released in Japan on November 21st 1999 that's the second set of titles in the Pokemon series these games which debuted as gameboy color games in Japan are being recreated for the Virtual Console versions such as their screens appeared just as they did on the gameboy color both titles will be compatible with the wireless feature communications of the Nintendo 3ds and trainers can look forward to link trades and link battles between the virtual console versions of pokemon gold and pokemon silver in addition these titles will be compatible with the time capsule function function which allows players to linked Pokemon between virtual console versions of pokemon gold and silver and the Virtual Console versions of pokemon red blue and yellow in Pokemon centers within these games both titles will be compatible with Pokemon Bank and will also launch on September 22nd 2017 I mean that's like I not exciting I mean gold and soul silver exists they were improvements and perfections of those original games so you've got to be a real nostalgia addict to be excited I I don't know this is this this might be my last rant for the show although I don't think I was if I was hard on son an ultra move and I'm very excited for those games I would be a little more excited if they were on switch but if they're not okay not the end of the world why is anyone excited for this alright I can give you I can give you one thing I'm gonna interrupt your rant because I forgot to say it when I was talking and I just remembered it yes HeartGold and SoulSilver are playable on the 3ds yes but but in order to transfer Pokemon from those games up into Pokemon bank you have to like do the switch he thing between pokemon black and white and pokemon it's it's like that game and you have to shoot at the balls at them to get them to come over and you can only do like six at a time or something it's horrible the at least this gets you an easier way to get your gen 2 pokemon into gen 7 so i will give them that but go on with your rant alright I am sick and tired of Pokemon fans asking for remakes I might have been on this bandwagon 5 or 6 years ago maybe even three years as early as three years ago but I cannot think of another franchise that has that their fanbase asks for remakes time and time again if I want to play diamond and pearl my 3ds can play diamond and pearl I'm not saying that the virtual console shouldn't have red blue yellow gold crystal silver firered/leafgreen I think Virtual Console should have them all would I go back and play them probably not especially in the the example of gold and silver why would I pay $10 for a game that is better that I own that I know exactly where it is it is in arm's reach of me and I have told people since I started this podcast that I think HeartGold and SoulSilver is easily one of the best Pokemon games of all time why would I pay for a less good version of that why I mean I already told you why but go on if they were to put those games on the Nintendo switch which they could they could say at e3 hey we're launching the Virtual Console these are the virtual console games that will appear for some reason we're Nintendo and some of the games don't make it to Virtual Console which makes no sense to me and I have not bought red yellow or blue because I've been burned so many times I bought so many Virtual Console games on Wii U and yeah they could make it to or on Wii and yeah they made it to wii u but i had to launch this really garbage emulator to play them and they wanted me to rebuy them again but don't worry we'll give you a discount it's unacceptable if they were to say hey we're launchin and again I think these games should be on Virtual Console I would probably consider buying red or blue because there I have no way I have no way of playing red or blue or fire red or leaf green on my 3ds if they were to say though hey we're putting gold and silver on switch and we're putting then this Pokemon game on switch and Pokemon bank will work and everything will be fine cool I have no way of playing gold silver or gold and silver I'm ice wish okay I will buy it I will play it it will be great because I carry my switch everywhere and I don't carry my 3ds everywhere I just do not understand why people are excited for gold and silver on Virtual Console when one when easily the best Pokemon game in the last decade you can play on 3ds and yeah kind of sucks the transfer Pokemon but I I was I was the one that was wrong when I said Pokemon bank was so important to these old games and everyone said no it was impossible they can't do it it's too much work how would they do IVs how would they do v's the special attack and attack were the same this is so much work and I said no Pokemon Bank is the most important thing and they have finally remember months later announced that that feature was coming and everyone shut up about it I didn't shut up for six months because I considered that a important feature and it exists and that's fine but who is playing that to transfer Pokemon up they're not playing that transfer Pokemon up they're playing that for nostalgia maybe there's some moves that can only be learned by Pokemon in those versions of the games maybe but none of it the none of that matters because they're so strict when it comes to tournament about moves and stuff I'm not not strict enough mmm and crystals missing and that was another conversation of debate why isn't crystal there I can tell you why crystals there because if crystal existed no one would be guy buying gold and silver because crystal is the better game just like no one should buy gold and silver because HeartGold and SoulSilver is the better game the only way this Virtual Console stuff works and again they should be on Virtual Console but they but they are on a system where so many Pokemon games exists better versions of that game that it is hard to justify that purchase again if all these games were on switch and you had no access to play heartgold SoulSilver gold silver crystal firered/leafgreen that makes sense and it also makes sense that once you complete those old games you can transfer them to your Pokemon bank and whatever Pokemon game you have and now going back to my original argument of I started this rant and saying I don't think they should make any more remakes or more or less people should stop asking for remakes and I just told you that I think the best pokemon game in the decade last decade was hark old soul silver which happened to be a remake the difference there is that red blue yellow gold crystal and silver they got cut off from the hardware generation and there was no way to play those games without being able to transfer you like you could play those games obviously but there was no way to transfer this Pokemon so yes I do think that there was value to firered and leafgreen I do think there was value to heartgold SoulSilver I think and that that was my argument for Pokemon Bank that these game like every one of these games is important enough that if you play through it and you do that journey your Pokemon should come with you and hark old souls over exists because of that and so does firered and leafgreen did we need an Omega Ruby alpha sapphire remaked no is anyone on the internet going Oh Meg a ruby and alpha sapphire is my favorite game No and there might be some people that say the end game is better I'm sure it is but do you know how many people actually get to the end game not a lot you can see that with Sun and Moon everyone bought it two weeks later everyone stopped playing it except for the people who played the end game and you could say ah well it's end game is not good enough that doesn't matter there's such a small amount of people that play endgame anyway so that's why it doesn't matter instead of doing an end game it'll just put out a pokemon game every year where we're like we're sitting right now the only difference is they're gonna sell and make a net profit of like ten million dollars instead of putting all that time into an end game where they're not gonna get any more money and like two percent of people are actually going to play I got nothing on your rant here would I like to see red and blue remade sure would I like to see diamond and pearl eventually remade sure but you know what I would really like to see new games it still blows my mind how vocal that fanbase was for Omega Ruby alpha sapphire or for just for just Ruby and Sapphire remakes and as soon as they came out everyone shut up and then they moved on to Diamond and Pearl why why do we need to remake every single game unless there is a hardware elimination that is stopping you I don't think a remake make sure to exist I will I would be more accepting and more excited if Diamond and Pearl came out on something like a switch because then because right now I have a way to play diamond and pearl works on my 3ds just fine just like heartgold SoulSilver works on my 3ds just fine was there some value in Omega Ruby alpha sapphire yeah I guess because the 3ds didn't have a GBA slot so I guess that kind of makes sense in that in that way I'm just asking Pokemon fans to stop asking for remix and start asking for more new content but yes remakes I guess remakes fill in the gaps going back to the original point of this article yes I do think that every Pokemon game should be on Virtual Console here on out but Virtual Console is a mess and I'm sure if you bought them on Virtual Console and for some reason they release them on switch or they release them on some imaginary console that exists in the future those won't move over because nothing moves over the Nintendo doesn't know how to handle their digital purchases I hope you feel better for having let that out I do and maybe in a day or two they'll announce something at e3 that'll be exciting I want to say though I'm not upset about this direct it's fine it was good awesome we have more Pokemon games coming out this year I'm actually excited yeah gives us keeps us in business but we got something to talk about business of ranting whatever business it is that we're in I can't even tell most days I I want to know about I want to know more about Sunday moon ultra ultra Sun and ultra moon I want to know more about that I want to know what game freak's actually working on for switch I want to know what they show at e3 I would be curious that they updated Pokemon Bank in some way the Pokemon go news is really exciting really it's been a really great week for Pokemon stuff no no Pokemon shuffle too though that's what I was really holding out for was a joke well it fell flat alright good yeah anything else any anything else I missed I can't think of anything I just you know I'm hoping that for the month of June we haven't heard the last of new things coming from the Pokemon company International that is my hope I hope so too yeah I hope that more news continues coming all right well let's do some housecleaning real quick Irene and I started a new podcast it is a Pokemon anime podcast currently titled a lowland a low love vacation because we are going through the Sun and Moon

charming and people seem to really like it probably mostly for Irene probably not because of me I mean she does have a good personality my question is I just upped my patreon donation to eight dollars a month and when do I get my link to the feed it should be on the actual profile of the page so if you go to patreon.com/scishow to get added to that feed but how does it know that I paid the extra money because there's there's this it'll say it'll say like patreon.com such it's super effective question mark RSS / authentication and then it'll say an equal sign and then it will have this long string of characters that is exclusive to your account like wow technology yeah I mean is it really cool it's really cool process and there was a couple people in slack that helped me determine this because I was like is this a universal feed is this a how does it know if somebody's paying a dollar or not paying or paying four dollars and so yeah it's it is very specific to it so if you're a $1 person you still get access to the feed except the episodes don't show up because they're they're pushed out at a four dollar level so in the future I could go oh this episode will be available to all $1 people and they will get that episode it's really cool it's really cool so if you want to support us if you want more content do you like the anime or you just want to to hear Irene and I talk more about Pokemon that is available to you patreon.com such it's super effective first episodes already out by the time this episode comes out if you made it this long through my rants the second episode
