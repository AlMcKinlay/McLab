house you're you're stuck going to the (1:55 - 1:59)
gas station like will anderson correct (1:57 - 2:01)

restaurants that okay that's (2:01 - 2:04)
everywhere that doesn't count i wanted (2:03 - 2:07)

chinese food unless you go to greg's (2:13 - 2:16)
secret special chinese restaurant (2:14 - 2:19)
chinese food in minnesota not that great (2:16 - 2:21)
vietnamese food though is great (2:19 - 2:24)
uh two things one i've had way too much (2:21 - 2:25)
chinese food since i've moved here it (2:24 - 2:27)
doesn't make any there's no such thing (2:25 - 2:28)
as way too much (2:27 - 2:32)
it is a wide variety of food that has (2:28 - 2:35)
many specialties the problem is you will (2:32 - 2:38)
only eat one specific thing on any given (2:35 - 2:40)
menu that is your problem (2:38 - 2:43)
you could be having (2:40 - 2:46)
billions of delightful dishes but you're (2:43 - 2:47)
like if it doesn't have chicken in it (2:46 - 2:50)
and it isn't breaded and or oranged i'm (2:47 - 2:53)
out two chickens i can do orange chicken (2:50 - 2:56)
and i can do sesame chicken (2:53 - 2:58)
chicken they're the same thing different (2:56 - 3:00)
i don't know what general that is i (2:58 - 3:02)
didn't study that war in school it's not (3:00 - 3:05)
a real general it didn't exist it was (3:02 - 3:08)
made up it's an american mega general (3:05 - 3:10)
it's not a thing (3:08 - 3:12)
i don't know about his chicken i'm not (3:10 - 3:13)
interested in it right now oh but you'll (3:12 - 3:15)
go to a fake colonel place and get (3:13 - 3:19)
chicken yeah never go to work (3:15 - 3:19)
is not a war hero keynes is technically (3:23 - 3:29)
a dog okay yeah you'll get chicken (3:26 - 3:31)
nuggets from a dog you get chicken (3:29 - 3:34)
nuggets from a 1940s cartoon character (3:31 - 3:35)
or (3:34 - 3:37)
but you won't get it from a fictional (3:35 - 3:39)
general (3:37 - 3:40)
here's the real problem (3:39 - 3:42)
i understand that mcdonald's is closed (3:40 - 3:44)
on christmas but at 1201 on boxing day (3:42 - 3:48)
we need to open back up no why because i (3:44 - 3:50)
i need a mcdouble you do i (3:48 - 3:53)
hate that i have this knowledge (3:50 - 3:55)
and it may be inappropriate for our (3:53 - 3:57)
listeners (3:55 - 3:59)
but (3:57 - 4:03)
the adult entertainment club (3:59 - 4:05)
that i am aware of (4:03 - 4:10)
did open at 1201 on boxing day (4:05 - 4:10)
i'm pretty sure you could have come up (4:10 - 4:15)
to my neighborhood (4:13 - 4:17)
and gone to flame burger and flame (4:15 - 4:19)
burger was open at one i don't know what (4:17 - 4:20)
flame burger is that sounds great number (4:19 - 4:21)
two (4:20 - 4:23)
taxes are going to be due on the first (4:21 - 4:24)
of the month so that would make sense (4:23 - 4:26)
well that they would open at 1201 you (4:24 - 4:29)
know it's almost the new year you got to (4:26 - 4:32)
get your taxes ready i understand (4:29 - 4:34)
okay (4:32 - 4:34)
let's talk about pokemon news (4:36 - 4:40)
[Music] (4:37 - 4:43)

everybody's done look i checked out (4:43 - 4:48)
shortly off on friday and i have not (4:46 - 4:51)
checked back into any aspect of my life (4:48 - 4:52)
uh (4:51 - 4:54)
oh there i i have some fun pokemon news (4:52 - 4:57)
that i hope is included on the docket (4:54 - 4:59)
that i never get to see for this program (4:57 - 5:00)
uh-huh (4:59 - 5:02)
let me uh do you want to start off with (5:00 - 5:04)
the news let's start off with the news (5:02 - 5:07)
uh there is going to be a vgc tournament (5:04 - 5:08)
called (5:07 - 5:10)
i don't know what the name is but it's (5:08 - 5:12)
real dumb and i really love it it's (5:10 - 5:14)
basically there's (5:12 - 5:16)
you have a team of six different pokemon (5:14 - 5:19)
but all each one can only know one move (5:16 - 5:21)
and that move is metronome (5:19 - 5:23)
oh the metronome battle (5:21 - 5:26)
yeah i'm into it (5:23 - 5:26)
uh (5:27 - 5:30)
i don't know when that opens but it is a (5:28 - 5:32)
single december 22nd it opened december (5:30 - 5:33)
22nd (5:32 - 5:36)
okay this single battle you use pokemon (5:33 - 5:37)
that have metronome can only have (5:36 - 5:38)
metronome (5:37 - 5:39)
um (5:38 - 5:42)
no no no ball guys sure if they can have (5:39 - 5:44)
this metronome they can only know metro (5:42 - 5:45)
they can only know metronome they can (5:44 - 5:48)
know one move metronome yeah (5:45 - 5:50)
heck yeah (5:48 - 5:51)
uh and there's no reason why you (5:50 - 5:53)
shouldn't be using grim snarl (5:51 - 5:56)
and for the those who are unaware (5:53 - 5:58)
metronome basically when it goes off it (5:56 - 6:01)
randomly selects any pokemon any other (5:58 - 6:05)
pokemon move that exists and does that (6:01 - 6:08)
one yes (6:05 - 6:10)
i suppose there is some strategy of like (6:08 - 6:13)
switching and (6:10 - 6:15)
you know if you if you have like a (6:13 - 6:17)
well if you're like against a clefairy (6:15 - 6:19)
and you're uh the hit mom chan you (6:17 - 6:21)
probably don't want to stay out in front (6:19 - 6:25)
of the clefairy but it's metronome (6:21 - 6:25)
what if the clefairy uses dazzling gleam (6:25 - 6:31)
it gets the stab you're super effective (6:27 - 6:32)
a dazzling gleam from a clefairy (6:31 - 6:33)
probably gonna be more than a dazzling (6:32 - 6:36)
gleam for how many total pokemon moves (6:33 - 6:39)
are there in the world (6:36 - 6:42)
that it can pick literally any one i (6:39 - 6:45)
mean like the thousands (6:42 - 6:45)
because that's the real winning (6:45 - 6:50)
metronome move explode explosion (6:47 - 6:51)
yeah and then you're like i want to make (6:50 - 6:53)
sure my all my pokemon are ghosts in (6:51 - 6:56)
case the explosion happened can any (6:53 - 6:58)
ghosts learn metronome (6:56 - 6:59)

bandwagon because i was going to play (10:36 - 10:39)
with a friend of mine and that friend (10:37 - 10:41)
let me down sounds like a pretty lousy (10:39 - 10:42)
friend pretty much (10:41 - 10:45)
yeah (10:42 - 10:45)
yeah unites a thing um (10:47 - 10:51)
i even have two new pokemon to play in (10:51 - 10:56)
that game i have decidua and (10:53 - 10:59)
uh what's her name zarina zarina hey (10:56 - 11:00)
make sure you get your zarina you have (10:59 - 11:03)
until the 31st to get you so just log in (11:00 - 11:05)
and grab it but you have to log in on a (11:03 - 11:06)
mobile device (11:05 - 11:08)
no it could be whatever okay (11:06 - 11:10)
the thing is though when i logged into (11:08 - 11:12)
my switch it's like oh you need to log (11:10 - 11:14)
into your mobile for summer it does this (11:12 - 11:15)
weird thing where it makes me log into (11:14 - 11:16)
my mobile first (11:15 - 11:18)
and then i can log into my switch and i (11:16 - 11:21)
don't know why it's doing that granted (11:18 - 11:23)
this is weeks ago (11:21 - 11:25)
and i haven't picked it up since because (11:23 - 11:26)
you know again i was gonna play with a (11:25 - 11:30)
friend but that friend uh so i completed (11:26 - 11:32)
battle pass one (11:30 - 11:34)
mm-hmm i did too which was the pirate (11:32 - 11:36)
score bunny at the end (11:34 - 11:37)
yep (11:36 - 11:40)
and then battle pass two (11:37 - 11:43)
i did not complete i got to like 40 of (11:40 - 11:45)
60 that was the gengar (11:43 - 11:47)
and that was on the podcast where i was (11:45 - 11:49)
like should i pay just to complete it (11:47 - 11:52)
and then it was too late (11:49 - 11:54)
i missed that that ship has sailed (11:52 - 11:56)
and then in but that's not to be (11:54 - 11:59)
confused with the ranked battle season (11:56 - 12:03)
of season one which i got to (11:59 - 12:05)
master rank or whatever (12:03 - 12:08)
and ever since the gengar thing ended so (12:05 - 12:12)
season two battle pass i (12:08 - 12:13)
have not (12:12 - 12:16)
played really i think i've maybe played (12:13 - 12:19)
maybe less than 10 matches (12:16 - 12:20)
in (12:19 - 12:22)
the third battle pass which was jungle (12:20 - 12:25)
venusaur (12:22 - 12:25)
sun sun sunshine i think was the name of (12:28 - 12:32)
that battle pass (12:30 - 12:34)
which was season two of ranked but (12:32 - 12:36)
season three battle pass (12:34 - 12:38)
so i only got to like level 10 in that (12:36 - 12:41)
battle pass they got an easy (12:38 - 12:43)
eight dollars out of me (12:41 - 12:45)
and then the absol one just started (12:43 - 12:47)
which is season four but we're still in (12:45 - 12:49)
season two of ranked (12:47 - 12:51)
so i have not moved anywhere in the rank (12:49 - 12:53)
ladder because i haven't played (12:51 - 12:55)
and i bought the absol battle pass and (12:53 - 12:57)
then i bought the kramaran skin because (12:55 - 12:59)
they finally gave my boy a skin (12:57 - 13:01)
so i'm giving unite money i'm just not (12:59 - 13:03)
playing unite and to be fair you would (13:01 - 13:04)
think like oh you're upset but i'm (13:03 - 13:07)
really happy honestly i don't like i (13:04 - 13:10)
gave it money i got the uh this the (13:07 - 13:13)
boost of like wow my favorite pokemon (13:10 - 13:15)
has a skin now (13:13 - 13:16)
and then i didn't get the anger of (13:15 - 13:18)
playing (13:16 - 13:19)
so really unite is a pretty great game (13:18 - 13:22)
honestly (13:19 - 13:22)
i did play in that tournament um but (13:24 - 13:29)
that was on the that was not on my (13:27 - 13:31)
account because we had to use like the (13:29 - 13:32)
twitch (13:31 - 13:33)
like (13:32 - 13:35)
fair play accounts or whatever so there (13:33 - 13:37)
was like you know yeah (13:35 - 13:39)
i did play in that tournament (13:37 - 13:40)
um (13:39 - 13:42)

in my go app (15:09 - 15:14)
are hatted pikachu of some sort (15:11 - 15:16)
i just caught a santa hat pikachu this (15:14 - 15:18)
morning (15:16 - 15:20)
i did the thing that i told myself i (15:18 - 15:22)
wasn't gonna do you brought more space i (15:20 - 15:25)
bought more pokemon space (15:22 - 15:28)
i was (15:25 - 15:28)
i i i i don't know what to throw away (15:29 - 15:35)
anymore i have 3 000 pokemon (15:31 - 15:37)
just send them to homeless not throwing (15:35 - 15:38)
them away (15:37 - 15:41)
yeah you can only send like 60 oxes a (15:38 - 15:42)
week (15:41 - 15:46)
the deoxys economy is very plentiful i (15:42 - 15:47)
have okay so just for some context maybe (15:46 - 15:49)
we have some new listeners or something (15:47 - 15:51)
i have never (15:49 - 15:53)
in the five years of this game (15:51 - 15:56)
transferred a (15:53 - 15:58)
transfer to legendary pokemon (15:56 - 16:01)
because i have probably paid a dollar to (15:58 - 16:03)
get that pokemon (16:01 - 16:05)
and they're legendary (16:03 - 16:08)
like i can't breathe legendary pokemon i (16:05 - 16:10)
can put a spirit tomb in the daycare and (16:08 - 16:12)
i can ride my bike for days and make (16:10 - 16:15)
tons of boxes like i can i can be (16:12 - 16:17)
swimming in spirit tube (16:15 - 16:19)
i can't i can't do that with like like (16:17 - 16:22)
if i back in the day when we had to walk (16:19 - 16:25)
uphill in the snow there we go to target (16:22 - 16:27)
and then up his face (16:25 - 16:28)
in the rain (16:27 - 16:30)
back from target (16:28 - 16:33)
if you wanted a zekrom in pokemon black (16:30 - 16:34)
or white i'm not sure which one which (16:33 - 16:38)
game that one is in white you (16:34 - 16:38)
they did the color reverse (16:39 - 16:44)
you had to play through (16:41 - 16:46)
like four fifths of the game catch the (16:44 - 16:48)
zekrom transfer it then start your game (16:46 - 16:51)
over and do it again they're not handing (16:48 - 16:54)
out zekroms like they are (16:51 - 16:55)
eevees (16:54 - 16:57)
so i i just (16:55 - 16:59)
i cannot imagine (16:57 - 17:01)
like on a raid day where i'm like i'm (16:59 - 17:03)
going to try to shiny hot entei and then (17:01 - 17:05)
do like 13 raids which was probably like (17:03 - 17:09)
10 bucks and then throw away the other (17:05 - 17:12)
entities like no they're going to home (17:09 - 17:13)
or they're staying and go and they're (17:12 - 17:15)
being used because they're being used (17:13 - 17:18)
for i can't throw out a legend that (17:15 - 17:20)
being said out of my 3000 pokemon most (17:18 - 17:22)
of them are not legends (17:20 - 17:24)
i don't i (17:22 - 17:25)
i don't know what to throw i have (17:24 - 17:28)
unknown i have like like multiple of (17:25 - 17:30)
every letter to home i don't want well i (17:28 - 17:32)
have unknown in home i don't need to (17:30 - 17:34)
send those to home they're they're just (17:32 - 17:36)
unknown but yeah but (17:34 - 17:38)
you you can put them in home and then (17:36 - 17:40)
they're out of your go what are you (17:38 - 17:42)
gonna use them for and go (17:40 - 17:44)
to trade because unknown are rare and go (17:42 - 17:45)
so if someone like (17:44 - 17:47)
we met up with james and james was (17:45 - 17:49)
missing like uh an h i think didn't have (17:47 - 17:51)

and then i got a d and it ended up being (18:06 - 18:12)
lucky so i got a lucky d that was cool (18:07 - 18:12)
this is a weird conversation if you (18:13 - 18:17)
expect us on the family family show to (18:15 - 18:19)
continue that conversation with you that (18:17 - 18:20)
is not going to happen how else am i (18:19 - 18:22)
supposed to say i have an unknown d that (18:20 - 18:25)
is lucky uh the lie (18:22 - 18:29)
save it for leftovers (18:25 - 18:29)
that's my one of my only lucky unknowns (18:29 - 18:34)
the letter d (18:31 - 18:34)
so i don't want to throw away unknown (18:34 - 18:38)
either and then i have like i have like (18:36 - 18:41)
40 course law (18:38 - 18:43)

chat out i got 40 relicanth i got only (18:47 - 18:52)
corsola that matters is the one that you (18:49 - 18:54)
got when we were in san antonio and (18:52 - 18:58)
drove out to that weird baptist church (18:54 - 19:00)
that we had to like drive under the (18:58 - 19:01)
entryway (19:00 - 19:06)
of their parking lot thing oh yeah (19:01 - 19:06)

blood oh these these are all the pokemon (19:12 - 19:16)
caught in 2017. i don't want to throw (19:14 - 19:18)
these away because these are these are (19:16 - 19:21)
good for lucky trade fodder the mental (19:18 - 19:23)
prison you have put yourself in totally (19:21 - 19:27)
totally is believing that somebody (19:23 - 19:29)
needs one of the unknown when they keep (19:27 - 19:31)
releasing them (19:29 - 19:33)
and they keep showing up in special (19:31 - 19:35)
events what you've decided is that you (19:33 - 19:37)
have to hold on to these so you can give (19:35 - 19:38)
somebody a shortcut (19:37 - 19:40)
but they're always showing up at events (19:38 - 19:42)
that people like paid events right like (19:40 - 19:45)
when's the last time a a normie a (19:42 - 19:48)
non-isc listener (19:45 - 19:50)
like you would like the last event they (19:48 - 19:52)
showed up at was the (19:50 - 19:54)
safari zone stuff which was you had to (19:52 - 19:55)
buy tickets (19:54 - 19:57)
they'd pay the money (19:55 - 19:59)
well i i like trading you are deciding (19:57 - 20:01)
also what's the what's the importance of (19:59 - 20:03)
lucky pokemon are are you using these (20:01 - 20:05)
pokemon to (20:03 - 20:07)
participate in the cups in the battles (20:05 - 20:11)
you could no no no no no no no no no no (20:07 - 20:14)

anonymous d is not gonna get you that (20:41 - 20:47)
that's true that wasn't that wasn't a (20:44 - 20:48)
set (20:47 - 20:50)
lucky i think that was just like random (20:48 - 20:50)
lucky (20:50 - 20:52)
sometimes you just get lucky with the (20:50 - 20:55)
lucky and you can get rid of the doubles (20:52 - 20:57)
of the unknown that you have in your (20:55 - 21:01)
phone and just keep one of each letter (20:57 - 21:04)
yeah i'm missing tea (21:01 - 21:06)
i got many teas (21:04 - 21:07)
so you keep one and then you trade it (21:06 - 21:09)
away and you know you have plenty of (21:07 - 21:13)
teas in home why do you need it in your (21:09 - 21:15)

each unknown letter and get put the (21:26 - 21:32)

living decks and go (21:36 - 21:41)

room these are the mental prisons you (21:52 - 21:56)
put yourself in i (21:54 - 21:58)
and it's also it's like make a choice (21:56 - 22:01)
either have the living decks (21:58 - 22:04)
or i have the living decks at home or (22:01 - 22:05)
have (22:04 - 22:07)
no no you said you wanted living decks (22:05 - 22:10)
and go either have the living decks and (22:07 - 22:11)
go (22:10 - 22:14)
or have a bunch of extra useless pokemon (22:11 - 22:15)
sitting there clogging up your arteries (22:14 - 22:17)
until you have a heart attack and die (22:15 - 22:19)
that'd make your choice (22:17 - 22:21)
yeah (22:19 - 22:21)
they got me though i was i was i was (22:23 - 22:29)
out of town (22:27 - 22:29)

20 pokemon space left (22:32 - 22:37)
and i deleted everything back to safari (22:35 - 22:39)
zone that we went to in st louis (22:37 - 22:41)
and i was like i still only have 20 (22:39 - 22:42)
spaces left like i i don't know what (22:41 - 22:44)
else to delete and i'm about to do two (22:42 - 22:46)
communities in a row (22:44 - 22:48)
outside (22:46 - 22:52)
with my pokeball plus for several hours (22:48 - 22:54)
i'm i'm just going to buy more storage (22:52 - 22:55)
i'm just gonna give them the four (22:54 - 22:57)
dollars and increase my storage you need (22:55 - 22:59)
to just go through and look at each and (22:57 - 23:02)
every individual pokemon in pokemon go (22:59 - 23:06)
and say does this pokemon spark joy (23:02 - 23:10)
and if not a lot of them do goodbye (23:06 - 23:10)
they can't wall a lot is not all get rid (23:10 - 23:15)
of your extra unknown (23:13 - 23:17)
quit pretending that i don't think (23:15 - 23:18)
unknown (23:17 - 23:19)
i don't think i don't think i i would i (23:18 - 23:21)
would wager to bet unknown is like a (23:19 - 23:24)
hundred of the three thousand (23:21 - 23:28)
okay but you you just paid for what (23:24 - 23:32)
50 more space 100 four dollars (23:28 - 23:34)
it's probably got rid of a hundred (23:32 - 23:36)
unknown that you're just hanging on to (23:34 - 23:38)
so you can seem cool (23:36 - 23:39)
you didn't have to spend that four (23:38 - 23:41)
dollars (23:39 - 23:44)
look if i could quickly transfer the 50 (23:41 - 23:46)
shiny dust skull that would also have (23:44 - 23:47)
saved me two dollars but i can only do (23:46 - 23:51)
like six duskol a week (23:47 - 23:53)
then delete the rest (23:51 - 23:55)
four weeks between community days (23:53 - 23:59)
goodness gracious that is 24 (23:55 - 24:01)
dusco you could have been transferring (23:59 - 24:03)
you're right you're right (24:01 - 24:06)
uh speaking of hats though (24:03 - 24:09)
from from december 31st 10 p.m to (24:06 - 24:12)
january 4th 8 p.m (24:09 - 24:14)
um (24:12 - 24:14)
the fireworks will appear in the game (24:15 - 24:20)
the story for the season heritage will (24:18 - 24:20)
continue (24:20 - 24:23)
you will get twice the hatch stardust (24:20 - 24:24)
twice the hatch candy twice the hatch (24:23 - 24:26)
distance (24:24 - 24:29)

hoot party hat wurmple party hat wobba (24:54 - 24:59)

all of those that i named (24:59 - 25:05)
can be shiny except for the raichu (25:01 - 25:07)
which doesn't have the shiny symbol (25:05 - 25:09)
which i'm assuming cannot be shiny in (25:07 - 25:10)
the wild but if you evolve the pikachu (25:09 - 25:12)
it can't like (25:10 - 25:15)
can you evolve the pikachu yes (25:12 - 25:16)
you second (25:15 - 25:18)
the pikachu is usually the one pokemon (25:16 - 25:21)
that could evolve with hats yes (25:18 - 25:22)
i have a question though i feel like (25:21 - 25:24)
there should be an asterisk on this (25:22 - 25:26)
right shoe that egg explains (25:24 - 25:30)
yeah it's weird yeah so (25:26 - 25:31)
my question is (25:30 - 25:33)
and you that knows the pokemon go (25:31 - 25:36)
community much better than i do (25:33 - 25:39)
where is the outrage (25:36 - 25:43)
that they have made hoot the surprise (25:39 - 25:46)
shiny special for this event (25:43 - 25:48)
when they have already said (25:46 - 25:52)
that in february a mere two months away (25:48 - 25:57)
all johto pokemon will be shiny capable (25:52 - 26:01)
so they've basically given us nothing (25:57 - 26:03)
no they've given us (26:01 - 26:05)
with a top hat and a bow tie but no no (26:03 - 26:07)
no no the way that they're advertising (26:05 - 26:10)
it is this is the first time that hoot (26:07 - 26:11)
can be shiny (26:10 - 26:14)
and it's like yeah but it was gonna be (26:11 - 26:16)
shiny anyways you already told us that (26:14 - 26:21)
so now you're just taking my money yeah (26:16 - 26:21)
look if you have fallen into niantic's (26:21 - 26:25)
tricks (26:24 - 26:28)
after five years that's your fault (26:25 - 26:31)
i i just what i'm trying to point out is (26:28 - 26:32)
the pokemon go community gets (26:31 - 26:34)
irrationally angry about a bunch of (26:32 - 26:36)
stuff and yet for some reason they're (26:34 - 26:38)
not angry about this thing which has (26:36 - 26:41)
some amount of rationality to it (26:38 - 26:45)
i think they were just angry (26:41 - 26:47)
at the amount of hats being released (26:45 - 26:50)
over there too many hats again i all my (26:47 - 26:53)
pokedocs is full of hats we have said in (26:50 - 26:57)
this program for years japan loves hats (26:53 - 27:00)
they do they do the japanese pokemon go (26:57 - 27:04)
player base is obsessed with these hats (27:00 - 27:06)
the silf road r (27:04 - 27:08)
self road (27:06 - 27:12)
for the most part hates the hats (27:08 - 27:15)
that our slash still fur road is a very (27:12 - 27:17)
small part of the overall (27:15 - 27:19)
pokemon go (27:17 - 27:20)
american (27:19 - 27:24)
english speaking community i should say (27:20 - 27:25)
um (27:24 - 27:28)
but we we do know that the japanese (27:25 - 27:30)
audience loves (27:28 - 27:32)
hat pokemon (27:30 - 27:33)
uh (27:32 - 27:36)
americans undecided i like the hats (27:33 - 27:38)
i do think there are a little too many (27:36 - 27:39)
hats (27:38 - 27:40)
here (27:39 - 27:41)
but (27:40 - 27:44)
ah it's like five days it's really not (27:41 - 27:46)
that big of a deal (27:44 - 27:48)
it's it's a it's like literally like (27:46 - 27:49)
five days (27:48 - 27:51)
thirty first to the fourth (27:49 - 27:52)
i don't know i don't think it's the end (27:51 - 27:53)
of the world (27:52 - 27:55)
five days of hats you could pretty much (27:53 - 27:58)
ignore them if you don't want to (27:55 - 27:59)
they're ruining your other spawns i (27:58 - 28:01)
don't know maybe if you're getting that (27:59 - 28:04)
mad over your game i'm sure you can take (28:01 - 28:05)
like four days off and just like (28:04 - 28:07)
relax (28:05 - 28:09)
things will be normal again once they're (28:07 - 28:11)
once they're done (28:09 - 28:13)
uh the following pokemon will be (28:11 - 28:14)
available in the wild (28:13 - 28:17)
new year's high pikachu seal (28:14 - 28:19)
20 20 glasses slowpoke new year's hat (28:17 - 28:22)
hoot hoot stantler party hat wormple (28:19 - 28:25)
loudrid if you're lucky trainers (28:22 - 28:28)
you may encounter a firo (28:25 - 28:28)
i believe the reason firo was picked (28:29 - 28:37)
is because its pokedex number is 22. (28:33 - 28:39)
oh (28:37 - 28:42)
oh ho (28:39 - 28:42)
some logic there hey going back to the (28:42 - 28:45)
hat conversation (28:43 - 28:47)
too many hats (28:45 - 28:50)
i don't think i've wanted to actually (28:47 - 28:52)

if i'm wearing a jacket (30:41 - 30:44)
why are we my emmy vicing the t-shirt (30:45 - 30:50)
like this is such a weird 80s style and (30:48 - 30:53)
that's what turns me off of it (30:50 - 30:55)
i thought you liked the 80s i liked the (30:53 - 30:57)
80s (30:55 - 30:57)
not all the 80s but not all of the 80s (30:57 - 31:03)
and the miami style (31:00 - 31:05)
clothing the sport coat with the t-shirt (31:03 - 31:07)
under it was never one of my favorite (31:05 - 31:10)
things transformers good trickle down (31:07 - 31:13)
economics bad (31:10 - 31:13)
this is off niantic's actual website (31:14 - 31:21)
ninetylabs.com the niantic recap 2021 (31:16 - 31:21)
uh (31:23 - 31:27)
2021 what a year in our new niantic (31:24 - 31:29)
recap we take a look back at exploring (31:27 - 31:31)
the world together we inspired billions (31:29 - 31:33)
of kilometer meters walked (31:31 - 31:35)
millions of friendships made and all new (31:33 - 31:37)
way spots found to be discovered thank (31:35 - 31:39)
you to our explorers lightship (31:37 - 31:42)
developers industry partners for coming (31:39 - 31:44)
uh and all of our niantics uh for coming (31:42 - 31:46)
along with this journey (31:44 - 31:50)
so the number (31:46 - 31:52)
where's number 10 okay (31:50 - 31:55)
countries walked the most (31:52 - 31:57)
number 10 (31:55 - 32:02)
japan i was going to say united states (31:57 - 32:02)
i thought japan would be higher but i (32:03 - 32:06)
guess they do have a lot of public (32:05 - 32:09)
transport (32:06 - 32:12)
and it's a pretty small country (32:09 - 32:15)
relatively small sure number nine (32:12 - 32:17)
france (32:15 - 32:20)
this is countries that walk the most (32:17 - 32:21)
number eight (32:20 - 32:24)
canada (32:21 - 32:25)
number seven (32:24 - 32:30)
the united states tank we got out walked (32:25 - 32:33)
oh i bet scotland's like number one (32:30 - 32:34)
thanks (32:33 - 32:35)
number six (32:34 - 32:37)
great britain (32:35 - 32:39)
yeah they didn't even cut to cut it down (32:37 - 32:41)
to smaller numbers all (32:39 - 32:44)
right number five (32:41 - 32:46)
spain (32:44 - 32:46)
number four (32:47 - 32:51)
germany (32:48 - 32:53)
number three (32:51 - 32:55)
this is a very forgotten thing in the (32:53 - 32:57)
pokemon go community (32:55 - 32:59)
specifically english players don't ever (32:57 - 33:02)
think of this number three is brazil (32:59 - 33:06)
brazil yeah there is a huge (33:02 - 33:10)
huge pokemon go players in brazil and (33:06 - 33:12)
it's also (33:10 - 33:14)
it gets cold there (33:12 - 33:17)
but most of the country it's not cold (33:14 - 33:21)
uh number two taiwan (33:17 - 33:23)
and the number one most (33:21 - 33:26)
walked country (33:23 - 33:26)
south korea (33:27 - 33:31)
ah (33:29 - 33:33)
is this per capita or is it just total (33:31 - 33:36)
miles walked per player is what it says (33:33 - 33:38)
on the ground (33:36 - 33:40)
9.4 (33:38 - 33:43)
kilometers per player japan would be (33:40 - 33:46)
3.0 that's the problem (33:43 - 33:49)
since we have so many players that the (33:46 - 33:51)
number of players who (33:49 - 33:54)
barely go anywhere is like (33:51 - 33:56)
pulling down (33:54 - 33:58)
the average for the other players who (33:56 - 34:01)
walk a lot (33:58 - 34:01)
i'm curious if they did the actual (34:03 - 34:08)
average or if they sort of compensated (34:06 - 34:10)
for (34:08 - 34:11)
like you had to be active within like (34:10 - 34:13)
the last six months or something well (34:11 - 34:16)
that are also like how many if they did (34:13 - 34:18)
anything like (34:16 - 34:18)
what's the you know what's the (34:19 - 34:23)
is the mean or the mode whichever one is (34:21 - 34:26)
like the most common (34:23 - 34:28)
player type what they walked instead of (34:26 - 34:30)
because you know it's like if you have (34:28 - 34:32)
one person that makes one dollar an hour (34:30 - 34:33)
and you have another person that makes a (34:32 - 34:36)
million dollars an hour like (34:33 - 34:37)
yeah (34:36 - 34:39)
technically everybody makes an average (34:37 - 34:40)
of (34:39 - 34:42)
500 000 (34:40 - 34:44)
but that's not a great picture of what's (34:42 - 34:47)
actually happening yeah (34:44 - 34:50)
um (34:47 - 34:50)
there were two million players who (34:52 - 34:57)
walked on average five kilometers a day (34:54 - 35:00)
what is five kilometers in freedom units (34:57 - 35:04)
uh it's about 3.1 miles got it (35:00 - 35:04)
uh (35:05 - 35:09)
3.8 million new way spots were added in (35:06 - 35:10)
2021 (35:09 - 35:15)
4.42 million visits to taipei taiwan (35:10 - 35:16)
um (35:15 - 35:19)
17.9 million visits to the grace plaza (35:16 - 35:22)
in new york city (35:19 - 35:24)
gracie plaza oh gracie plot sorry look (35:22 - 35:27)
is it does it have an eye in it no (35:24 - 35:29)
oh then it would just be grace plaza (35:27 - 35:31)
because gracie mansion is where the uh (35:29 - 35:34)
mayor of new york lives (35:31 - 35:35)
we'll skip over the ingress stuff (35:34 - 35:36)
because i don't know what's happening in (35:35 - 35:42)
ingress 3.9 billion eggs hatched (35:36 - 35:42)
10.269 billion pokemon caught during (35:42 - 35:47)
community 2021 communities (35:45 - 35:50)
and then 12 (35:47 - 35:53)
billion gifts were given (35:50 - 35:56)
and then for pikmin bloom 63 million (35:53 - 35:58)
flowers planted (35:56 - 36:03)
338 billion steps and 113 million pikmin (35:58 - 36:05)
grown (36:03 - 36:07)
some highlights here (36:05 - 36:10)
from niantic held our inaugural hybrid (36:07 - 36:12)
pokemon go fest bring back (36:10 - 36:14)

community through five acquisitions (36:27 - 36:32)
watch the first ever (36:30 - 36:35)
niantic brand film meet you out there (36:32 - 36:37)
bringing to our life (36:35 - 36:39)
bringing to a life our mission (36:37 - 36:41)
shipped new games transformers heavy (36:39 - 36:44)
metal in soft launch and pikmin bloom (36:41 - 36:47)
that gave uh new players new people new (36:44 - 36:50)
people gave people new ways to connect (36:47 - 36:52)
and play together and they opened their (36:50 - 36:55)
farmers heavy (36:52 - 36:55)
yeah that was in there in the video you (36:56 - 36:59)
have to watch the niantic video about (36:58 - 37:01)
all the games not watching two-minute (36:59 - 37:04)
propaganda films well i'm a child stay (37:01 - 37:07)
uninformed i know what what it was like (37:04 - 37:09)
to get propaganda film from both russia (37:07 - 37:12)
and america and i'm not into it (37:09 - 37:14)
opened our light chip platform to enable (37:12 - 37:16)
developer to for two developers to (37:14 - 37:19)
enable a new wave of engaging real world (37:16 - 37:21)
ar experiences (37:19 - 37:22)
i i'm still playing pikmin i'm still (37:21 - 37:25)
liking it i play it every day i did that (37:22 - 37:27)
pikmin community on uh (37:25 - 37:30)
pokemon community as did greg and i it's (37:27 - 37:32)
it's just night you just you just turn (37:30 - 37:34)
it on and you go back to pokemon and (37:32 - 37:36)
it's good what i find hilarious is that (37:34 - 37:39)
the pikmin community day goals are walk (37:36 - 37:41)
10 000 steps which with the new one (37:39 - 37:43)
that's like throughout the entire day (37:41 - 37:44)
not time to limited (37:43 - 37:46)
yeah i pretty much walk 10 000 steps (37:44 - 37:48)
every day (37:46 - 37:50)
anyways it's like this is not a goal i (37:48 - 37:52)
definitely don't depending what's (37:50 - 37:53)
happening but (37:52 - 37:55)
uh i didn't find out that my steps (37:53 - 37:56)
didn't count because there's a while (37:55 - 37:57)
that remember while i was playing (37:56 - 38:00)
pokemon go my network freaked out for a (37:57 - 38:01)
while (38:00 - 38:03)
yeah yeah that stopped my steps from (38:01 - 38:05)
counting in pikmin (38:03 - 38:06)
i (38:05 - 38:08)
was saying this on (38:06 - 38:12)
on my twitch stream for some reason (38:08 - 38:15)
i because pikmin is translated in steps (38:12 - 38:18)
it feels better than like maybe because (38:15 - 38:21)
i just never learned kilometers (38:18 - 38:22)
go in school (38:21 - 38:26)
but like yeah like uh i have a 2k egg or (38:22 - 38:27)
a 7k egg (38:26 - 38:28)
i (38:27 - 38:31)
it just seems harder to hatch (38:28 - 38:32)
because like i don't know what that is (38:31 - 38:33)
in my head (38:32 - 38:35)
versus like (38:33 - 38:36)
oh (38:35 - 38:40)
i've walked 500 steps for this pikmin if (38:36 - 38:43)
i walk another 500 steps it will bloom (38:40 - 38:45)
or it'll pop out of the ground or (38:43 - 38:46)
whatever it is (38:45 - 38:48)
or when it's like (38:46 - 38:51)
your personal best yesterday was 5 000 (38:48 - 38:54)
you only have to do 700 more steps and (38:51 - 38:56)
it's like 700 steps seems very doable (38:54 - 39:00)
right now um (38:56 - 39:02)
i i kind of wish there was like a toggle (39:00 - 39:05)
in pogo to be like i want miles i want (39:02 - 39:07)
kilometers i want steps it's called (39:05 - 39:09)
imperial (39:07 - 39:13)
is that what wait metric or imperial (39:09 - 39:14)
[Laughter] (39:13 - 39:16)
well just leave it this way 2k eggs are (39:14 - 39:20)
roughly a mile 3k 5k eggs or roughly how (39:16 - 39:22)
many steps is a mile what (39:20 - 39:24)
well how about how big your feet are how (39:22 - 39:26)
big your feet are like we've pre-proved (39:24 - 39:29)
in the mall that my steps because i walk (39:26 - 39:31)
shorter steps than you do my steps are (39:29 - 39:35)
different than your steps (39:31 - 39:35)
yeah (39:35 - 39:38)
i like the steps though (39:36 - 39:40)
yeah but like (39:38 - 39:43)
our steps are going to be different (39:40 - 39:45)
they go by distance but all red pigments (39:43 - 39:47)
are a thousand steps so i don't really (39:45 - 39:48)
care if you (39:47 - 39:50)
walk faster than me i just like the i (39:48 - 39:52)
don't know i like the steps more it just (39:50 - 39:54)
it just feels easier to say (39:52 - 39:57)
enable you to not have to learn anything (39:54 - 39:58)
the american way (39:57 - 40:01)
correct but i'm very also (39:58 - 40:04)
since they picked distance (40:01 - 40:06)
for go they can't (40:04 - 40:09)
translate that into steps (40:06 - 40:10)
they can do whatever they want it's (40:09 - 40:12)
their video game i am saying like they (40:10 - 40:14)
would have to change how they captured (40:12 - 40:17)
wouldn't steps make more sense though in (40:14 - 40:19)
the main series game it's like dratini (40:17 - 40:21)
they make sense today (40:19 - 40:24)
they didn't make sense five years ago (40:21 - 40:26)
well let's get with the times (40:24 - 40:27)
if we're going to say ignition you want (40:26 - 40:30)
to get some pokemon go complaints (40:27 - 40:32)
watch them switch to steps also another (40:30 - 40:34)
thing about pikmin is they give you the (40:32 - 40:36)
like two free (40:34 - 40:37)
whatever (40:36 - 40:38)
planters yeah (40:37 - 40:40)
and i feel like that makes such a (40:38 - 40:41)
difference (40:40 - 40:44)
over one free incubator yes like if (40:41 - 40:47)
niantic was like here is you can get (40:44 - 40:51)
another permanent incubator it is 35 but (40:47 - 40:53)
it is permanent i'd be like (40:51 - 40:55)
yes please (40:53 - 40:57)
something about having two instead of (40:55 - 40:58)
one (40:57 - 41:01)
much better that's you (40:58 - 41:01)
like i have no (41:02 - 41:06)
desire okay even with pikmin there's no (41:04 - 41:09)
surprise right like you're planting uh (41:06 - 41:11)
you're planting a a purple one you're (41:09 - 41:12)
planting a pink one you know exactly (41:11 - 41:14)
what's happening that's not true that's (41:12 - 41:16)
i could plant one of those large (41:14 - 41:18)
bowls and then you never know what's (41:16 - 41:19)
gonna pop out of that and what they're (41:18 - 41:21)
going to do with that (41:19 - 41:23)
ornament they're going to put on i got (41:21 - 41:24)
no christmas pikmin (41:23 - 41:27)
a little upset about that (41:24 - 41:30)
but the (41:27 - 41:31)
in pogo it's just like (41:30 - 41:33)
i had a bunch of incubators over (41:31 - 41:34)
community (41:33 - 41:36)
because i sit on incubators because i (41:34 - 41:38)
normally save my incubators on a day (41:36 - 41:41)
where it's like double hatch candy (41:38 - 41:44)
half incubator distance special eggs i'm (41:41 - 41:45)
already gonna be walking so i was like (41:44 - 41:46)
okay (41:45 - 41:49)
we're out here walking in 80 degree (41:46 - 41:51)
weather let's load up this incubators (41:49 - 41:52)
and it's like (41:51 - 41:54)
fletchling duskull (41:52 - 41:56)
squirtle i think none of these are (41:54 - 41:59)
exciting why would i have paid money for (41:56 - 42:02)
this experience but in like pikmin it's (41:59 - 42:04)
like i know i'm getting two red ones and (42:02 - 42:06)
i'm very happy when they uh look they (42:04 - 42:08)
hatch and then i put the two purple ones (42:06 - 42:09)
in and then like (42:08 - 42:11)
30 minutes later they hatch and then (42:09 - 42:14)
you you got bad egg strats you got to (42:11 - 42:15)
load up (42:14 - 42:19)
on jam up your egg storage with 2k eggs (42:15 - 42:21)
until there's a good event (42:19 - 42:24)
then you clear out all those 2k eggs as (42:21 - 42:26)
fast as possible and collect the good (42:24 - 42:29)
eggs from the event and then you only (42:26 - 42:31)
have good eggs no they were not good (42:29 - 42:32)
eggs they were giving me fletchlings i (42:31 - 42:33)
don't want that well then you didn't (42:32 - 42:35)
listen to whatever program needed to (42:33 - 42:37)
tell you what was going to be in those (42:35 - 42:38)
eggs so you'd know whether they were (42:37 - 42:40)
going to be good or not it's not like i (42:38 - 42:42)
had a choice well those were the only (42:40 - 42:44)
eggs happening anyway then you used your (42:42 - 42:47)
incubator on the wrong day (42:44 - 42:47)
uh (42:49 - 42:52)
before we move to a question that we can (42:50 - 42:53)
poke from the week because this is not a (42:52 - 42:57)
terribly long [ __ ] episode this week um (42:53 - 43:00)
well where are you in shining pearl and (42:57 - 43:02)
brilliant diamond i'm very mad i said (43:00 - 43:04)
those backwards i (43:02 - 43:05)
have (43:04 - 43:08)
just uh the my latest gym was byron and (43:05 - 43:11)
i'm going around looking at all the oh (43:08 - 43:13)
oh it just frustrates me because i (43:11 - 43:15)
listen to sincerely sinnoh (43:13 - 43:17)
as i complete these different segments (43:15 - 43:18)
and i'm like (43:17 - 43:19)
[Laughter] (43:18 - 43:21)
you will notice in pokemon of the week (43:19 - 43:24)
how i feel about sincerely sinnoh (43:21 - 43:25)
don't (43:24 - 43:28)
don't (43:25 - 43:28)
they blew up one lake (43:32 - 43:37)
and then for those of us who were paying (43:35 - 43:40)
attention to the dialogue (43:37 - 43:42)
when that lake blew up (43:40 - 43:44)
the other lake spirits came out of their (43:42 - 43:47)
little holes and that's when team (43:44 - 43:49)
galactic caught them that's why they (43:47 - 43:52)
didn't have to blow up the other lakes (43:49 - 43:53)
but (43:52 - 43:55)
team galactic didn't know that was going (43:53 - 43:57)
to happen but that's okay they were they (43:55 - 43:59)
were ready they were boy scouts always (43:57 - 44:01)
be prepared never said they had bombs (43:59 - 44:02)
also none of us knew what team (44:01 - 44:05)
galactic's i plans were they blew up one (44:02 - 44:07)
either way that's where i am that's (44:05 - 44:09)
right (44:07 - 44:10)
except i've decided to go down i (44:09 - 44:12)
listened to greg i decided to go down to (44:10 - 44:15)
the iron island before i go up to (44:12 - 44:17)
snowpoint so yeah we're working on that (44:15 - 44:20)
right can i agree with will here in at (44:17 - 44:23)
least team galactic (44:20 - 44:25)
had somewhat of a plan compared to (44:23 - 44:27)
whatever the heck team flare was doing (44:25 - 44:29)
in that entire game team flare had a (44:27 - 44:31)
plan you just didn't understand what it (44:29 - 44:32)
was (44:31 - 44:34)
i don't think they understood what it (44:32 - 44:37)
was besides like wearing red suits i (44:34 - 44:40)
don't know look incredible (44:37 - 44:41)
slay (44:40 - 44:44)
what more do you say (44:41 - 44:46)
nothing you need nothing more you don't (44:44 - 44:48)
know okay blow up the universe you need (44:46 - 44:50)
you need to blow up a lake you just need (44:48 - 44:53)
to look hot and be there (44:50 - 44:54)
here (44:53 - 44:56)
here's my weekly complaint about burling (44:54 - 44:57)
diamond shining pro (44:56 - 44:59)
why did i let this happen number one is (44:57 - 45:01)
i think greg dislikes this game more (44:59 - 45:03)
than i do (45:01 - 45:06)
um i'm not so sure about that (45:03 - 45:09)
not not from what i've heard (45:06 - 45:11)
i'm still playing it what so am i what (45:09 - 45:16)
are you basing that off of your tweet (45:11 - 45:17)
my tweet that i (45:16 - 45:20)
that and contemplating not playing the (45:17 - 45:22)
game again do you want to play all (45:20 - 45:24)
shining pearl (45:22 - 45:26)
no i don't right now (45:24 - 45:28)
stop playing (45:26 - 45:30)
shining pearl to start up a whole new (45:28 - 45:32)
game of brilliant diamond (45:30 - 45:34)
what if if (45:32 - 45:36)
if it was like a nuzlocke yes (45:34 - 45:38)
okay so (45:36 - 45:40)
that is where i'm at except i don't have (45:38 - 45:42)
an audience that's like let's watch you (45:40 - 45:45)
do this it is me sitting in my house (45:42 - 45:48)
so my statement of normally i would be (45:45 - 45:51)
very excited at this point to start up (45:48 - 45:53)
the second game you would not want to (45:51 - 45:54)
know (45:53 - 45:56)
alongside me (45:54 - 45:59)
if you said hey let's do (45:56 - 46:02)
oh don't forget pokemon unite greg (45:59 - 46:04)
well i know believe me i know that this (46:02 - 46:08)
is a lie but if you said yes let's (46:04 - 46:10)
nuzlock (46:08 - 46:10)
together and then like after every gym (46:10 - 46:14)
i'll come over and we'll do a battle (46:13 - 46:16)
with our teams (46:14 - 46:18)
then that would get me to play that game (46:16 - 46:19)
interesting (46:18 - 46:22)
uh here's my complaint (46:19 - 46:25)
when you get to ramparados park (46:22 - 46:27)
where you catch the mewtwo's and the (46:25 - 46:29)
reggie rocks and all that stuff yes (46:27 - 46:32)
there's a lady in there small spoiler (46:29 - 46:34)
she's she asks for a pokemon that eats a (46:32 - 46:35)
lot and sleeps a lot i'm gonna spoil who (46:34 - 46:38)
that is snorlax (46:35 - 46:40)
you show her a snorlax (46:38 - 46:42)
she gets all excited she gives you (46:40 - 46:43)
something i don't remember what it is (46:42 - 46:44)
that's not important (46:43 - 46:48)
you that's you the calorie counter (46:44 - 46:50)
oh yeah gives you a fitbit she gives you (46:48 - 46:52)
she gives you like the cooking timer (46:50 - 46:54)
yeah you then leave and come back in (46:52 - 46:55)
because that's the only way to (46:54 - 46:59)
regenerate her to have new dialogue (46:55 - 47:01)
and then she'll she's like i want a (46:59 - 47:05)
pokemon that changes colors (47:01 - 47:05)
spoiler the answer is kecleon (47:06 - 47:10)
here's my complaint (47:08 - 47:13)
if you were playing shining pearl (47:10 - 47:14)
and you were trying to collect all the (47:13 - 47:18)
poke watches there's 20 of them (47:14 - 47:20)
nobody's doing that (47:18 - 47:22)
no one's doing that there's 24 in (47:20 - 47:23)
platinum i don't remember what the four (47:22 - 47:26)
are but you know faithful remake (47:23 - 47:29)
keklian is a version exclusive to (47:26 - 47:32)
diamond (47:29 - 47:35)
you can't even get all of the poke (47:32 - 47:37)
etches (47:35 - 47:39)
in pearl (47:37 - 47:42)
without needing to trade their diamond (47:39 - 47:44)
does not have this disadvantage they can (47:42 - 47:47)
get all 20 just fine (47:44 - 47:50)
but the re the re like (47:47 - 47:51)
what (47:50 - 47:53)
what a stretch for a complaint what it (47:51 - 47:55)
is a complaint (47:53 - 47:56)
i can't think of another pokemon game (47:55 - 47:59)
where it's actually hiding a feature (47:56 - 48:02)
it's not a very good feature (47:59 - 48:02)
i mean hiding a fee hiding a post game (48:02 - 48:09)
feature on a bad watch that you aren't (48:07 - 48:11)
using anyways (48:09 - 48:15)
is like principal greg it's the princess (48:11 - 48:17)
what are you even talking about it's not (48:15 - 48:19)
it would be i think it would feel better (48:17 - 48:21)
i look this is a stretch of complaint i (48:19 - 48:22)
think it would feel better if like yes (48:21 - 48:26)
correct if if diamond had one watch face (48:22 - 48:29)
that was like oh you need (48:26 - 48:31)
um (48:29 - 48:34)
what's a version exclusive in in glamio (48:31 - 48:36)
gla you need glam meow to get this and (48:34 - 48:37)
then in this game you need mercro to get (48:36 - 48:40)
that encourages training (48:37 - 48:43)
but it's so what it's one-sided on pearl (48:40 - 48:44)
side that (48:43 - 48:47)
i will say this out of all the poke (48:44 - 48:49)
watches tons of people in my twitch chat (48:47 - 48:51)
how did you change the color of your (48:49 - 48:52)
poke how did you change the color of the (48:51 - 48:54)
poke etch why is your poke catch purple (48:52 - 48:57)
how did you make your poacher it was a t (48:54 - 48:59)
look people want it you can say it's a (48:57 - 49:01)
useless feature people (48:59 - 49:02)
want the color (49:01 - 49:04)
changing (49:02 - 49:06)
people want anything to make that game (49:04 - 49:08)
exciting like that's hard and it's (49:06 - 49:11)
hidden behind a keklian but like you're (49:08 - 49:12)
at the part of the game where you're (49:11 - 49:14)
trying to complete the pokedex anyway so (49:12 - 49:16)
you would have to trade it like you have (49:14 - 49:19)
to be doing that anyways to get the (49:16 - 49:21)
national decks to get rotom to get all (49:19 - 49:24)
of these things like it is (49:21 - 49:26)
patent parcel of everything that's (49:24 - 49:28)
happening in the game so it's slightly (49:26 - 49:32)
one watch face is hidden (49:28 - 49:33)
in one game (49:32 - 49:34)
yes (49:33 - 49:36)
it's just a weird thing for you to be (49:34 - 49:38)
pointing at it's because you're playing (49:36 - 49:39)
pearl (49:38 - 49:41)
the better version (49:39 - 49:43)
because it has glamio do you know they (49:41 - 49:44)
messed up version exclusives in this (49:43 - 49:46)
game yes how (49:44 - 49:50)
how so spiel this feel line is exclusive (49:46 - 49:52)
to (49:50 - 49:52)
pearl (49:52 - 49:55)
right (49:55 - 49:59)
yep but they forgot to remove a wild (49:55 - 50:02)
walron yep from diamond (49:59 - 50:04)
so even though you can't get spheel and (50:02 - 50:06)
wall rain (50:04 - 50:09)
yep snow sorry steel and celio in (50:06 - 50:12)
diamond you can find a wild wall right (50:09 - 50:14)
and then catch it and then breed it yeah (50:12 - 50:15)
but they actually messed the version (50:14 - 50:17)
excited because they forgot to remove (50:15 - 50:18)
wall rain i don't know there was a (50:17 - 50:21)
recent update to my version of the game (50:18 - 50:24)
so maybe they removed that (50:21 - 50:24)
it is (50:25 - 50:29)
wild to me of how broken this game has (50:26 - 50:31)
been (50:29 - 50:32)
i have not had any (50:31 - 50:35)
breaks i cannot reproduce any of the (50:32 - 50:37)
bugs i've gotten (50:35 - 50:38)
hmm (50:37 - 50:41)
will you give her foreign (50:38 - 50:42)
you've run into that one where you can't (50:41 - 50:44)
walk through certain patches of grass (50:42 - 50:46)
there's the invisible barrier yeah that (50:44 - 50:48)
one's easy to fix you hit like the y (50:46 - 50:49)
button to like toggle it it's still dumb (50:48 - 50:51)
though but but yeah no big that's one of (50:49 - 50:52)
the things that you'll run into where (50:51 - 50:55)
you just are running to a piece of rest (50:52 - 50:56)
and suddenly you're stopped for no (50:55 - 50:58)
reason you're just like (50:56 - 51:00)
why (50:58 - 51:01)
can't i get it because i've seen people (51:00 - 51:03)
who are running to shiny patches and it (51:01 - 51:06)
has the invisible wall around it (51:03 - 51:08)
i hate that you guys use me as the (51:06 - 51:10)
excuse to complain about brilliant (51:08 - 51:12)
diamond shining pearl oh yeah yeah yeah (51:10 - 51:14)
uh that's not how is that a complaint (51:12 - 51:16)
it's an actual bug that people are (51:14 - 51:18)
running into well (51:16 - 51:20)
you're you're pushing the game to its (51:18 - 51:22)
limits i don't know i have not run into (51:20 - 51:24)
anything i haven't had any of these (51:22 - 51:26)
problems you haven't really i can't (51:24 - 51:28)
that's that problem specifically on your (51:26 - 51:30)
radar they probably never will there's a (51:28 - 51:33)
another game coming out in like three (51:30 - 51:35)
weeks i gotta make time to play (51:33 - 51:38)
you know i will say that 1.1.3 which is (51:35 - 51:40)
the update (51:38 - 51:42)
so they did some slight magic where the (51:40 - 51:44)
underground doesn't feel as unbearable (51:42 - 51:46)
when you're walking through it because (51:44 - 51:47)
like when you were when you would walk (51:46 - 51:49)
through like the caverns (51:47 - 51:51)
we talked about this before you felt (51:49 - 51:52)
like you were like getting stuck to all (51:51 - 51:54)
the walls or like the walls wouldn't (51:52 - 51:56)
like you you did i used the d-pad and (51:54 - 51:59)
never had that problem you know (51:56 - 52:01)
well i made a d-pad i made a video about (51:59 - 52:02)
using the ipad in the underground just (52:01 - 52:04)
for you and i literally could not walk (52:02 - 52:05)
through (52:04 - 52:07)
two rocks why would you waste your time (52:05 - 52:09)
making videos for somebody who will (52:07 - 52:11)
never watch because then we can talk to (52:09 - 52:13)
them and everybody can know what type of (52:11 - 52:15)
person you are because they'll say what (52:13 - 52:17)
is will talking about there's a video (52:15 - 52:19)
about how that's messed up and he keeps (52:17 - 52:20)
going on about how the d-pad is a (52:19 - 52:23)
serious way it is to under cut your (52:20 - 52:25)
credibility well i've got no credibility (52:23 - 52:28)
in this i know now we're going into negi (52:25 - 52:28)
numbers (52:28 - 52:30)
hey that video got a lot of views i was (52:28 - 52:32)
very happy with it and i watched it back (52:30 - 52:34)
and it made me laugh i will say a lot of (52:32 - 52:35)
the bugs in the game just do make me (52:34 - 52:38)
laugh like they're very funny (52:35 - 52:40)
um (52:38 - 52:40)
these games are bad (52:41 - 52:45)
they're not bad they're just i'm having (52:43 - 52:47)
a fantastic time i am (52:45 - 52:50)
absolutely loving my experience (52:47 - 52:52)
but they're they're bad but for some (52:50 - 52:54)
reason there's like a slight charm where (52:52 - 52:56)
i kept playing them unlike omega ruby (52:54 - 52:58)
off sapphire must have just been like (52:56 - 53:00)
the time and place i was in where i just (52:58 - 53:01)
threw my hands up there and i was like (53:00 - 53:02)
i'll come back to these games in like (53:01 - 53:04)
two years but obviously (53:02 - 53:07)
you weren't playing them for people (53:04 - 53:09)
i went yeah i wasn't playing them on (53:07 - 53:11)
twitch so you have to sort of take the (53:09 - 53:14)
audience like if you're sitting at home (53:11 - 53:17)
alone and you had nobody (53:14 - 53:18)
watching i mean i thought i was still (53:17 - 53:20)
doing the podcast you know we were still (53:18 - 53:22)
talking about oh my (53:20 - 53:23)
well you weren't you weren't on the show (53:22 - 53:25)
when will and i were talking about (53:23 - 53:29)
omega ruby alpha sapphire correct (53:25 - 53:29)
but no i mean (53:33 - 53:37)
i also had to play the game for the (53:35 - 53:39)
podcast it is a different experience day (53:37 - 53:41)
to day to be like do i want to pick this (53:39 - 53:44)
up and do (53:41 - 53:46)
whatever (53:44 - 53:47)
with (53:46 - 53:49)
all by myself or are there other things (53:47 - 53:51)
i'd rather be doing and that's sort of (53:49 - 53:53)
the dilemma that also was the tweet (53:51 - 53:55)
today like (53:53 - 53:58)
i have multiple classes i want a level (53:55 - 54:01)
in final fantasy 14 and normally at the (53:58 - 54:02)
point where final fantasy 14 wouldn't (54:01 - 54:04)
have the draw that it has because oh i (54:02 - 54:07)
have another new playthrough of pokemon (54:04 - 54:09)
to do and i'm (54:07 - 54:12)
not feeling that pull at all for shiny (54:09 - 54:14)
pearl like i just am not in a spot where (54:12 - 54:17)
i'm like i want to go through this long (54:14 - 54:19)
story again (54:17 - 54:21)
here here's what i'll say like (54:19 - 54:23)
because i i feel like people listen or (54:21 - 54:25)
they they think it's like super unfair (54:23 - 54:29)
or or like we just hate these games if i (54:25 - 54:31)
if i look at the last (54:29 - 54:33)
two poke let's skip let's go just for (54:31 - 54:34)
the sake of the conversation let's look (54:33 - 54:37)
at ultra sun and moon and sword and (54:34 - 54:40)
shield it's like story-wise journey-wise (54:37 - 54:43)
through through the three of those games (54:40 - 54:44)
the third game being brilliant diamond (54:43 - 54:47)
shining pro like fine like i think if (54:44 - 54:48)
you're buying a pokemon game for the (54:47 - 54:50)
story (54:48 - 54:51)
and you just want to experience eight (54:50 - 54:53)
gyms and an elite four (54:51 - 54:56)
i think all are pretty equally fine like (54:53 - 54:58)
i think all those games have a point (54:56 - 55:00)
where it's like ugh (54:58 - 55:01)
what's happening right now but for the (55:00 - 55:03)
most part the story beats of like new (55:01 - 55:06)
gym new pokemon that stuff like it does (55:03 - 55:07)
what it needs to do (55:06 - 55:09)
i think then like the shiny hunting (55:07 - 55:11)
again same thing whether or not you (55:09 - 55:14)
liked sos or you liked chain fishing or (55:11 - 55:16)
you liked hordes or you liked (55:14 - 55:18)
whatever method (55:16 - 55:20)
you're going to gravitate towards one (55:18 - 55:22)
and a lot of people gravitate towards (55:20 - 55:25)
radar and it so again like i think the (55:22 - 55:27)
shiny hunting equal across all of them (55:25 - 55:28)
like it's just like if you like shiny (55:27 - 55:30)
hunting this is a thing you like shiny (55:28 - 55:32)
hunting but you're probably biased (55:30 - 55:34)
towards a shiny hunting method it might (55:32 - 55:35)
happen to be radar it might happen to be (55:34 - 55:38)
sos it might happen to be masuda but so (55:35 - 55:41)
for story and for shiny hunting i think (55:38 - 55:43)
you could take it or leave it with all (55:41 - 55:45)
three of these games i think where where (55:43 - 55:47)
diamond and pearl starts to fall apart (55:45 - 55:50)
for me is completing the actual decks (55:47 - 55:52)
um in sword and shield incredibly (55:50 - 55:55)
enjoyable in in ultrasound ultramoon (55:52 - 55:57)
also incredibly enjoyable (55:55 - 55:58)
and i think what ultrasound ultra moon (55:57 - 56:00)
did well is not only provide tons of (55:58 - 56:03)
pokemon throughout the four different (56:00 - 56:05)
islands but they broke it down into four (56:03 - 56:07)
different islands which made it very (56:05 - 56:08)
like (56:07 - 56:10)
not like baby's first pokemon but it (56:08 - 56:11)
like (56:10 - 56:13)
psychology wise it was like i'm just (56:11 - 56:14)
gonna focus on island one and then i'm (56:13 - 56:16)
going to focus on island two and because (56:14 - 56:17)
i did both of these oh my gosh island (56:16 - 56:19)
three is almost done like it was very (56:17 - 56:21)
obtainable and (56:19 - 56:23)
sword and shield did that a different (56:21 - 56:24)
way which was like through max raid (56:23 - 56:27)
battles hey i don't have a surface but (56:24 - 56:28)
somebody else has a surface and they're (56:27 - 56:31)
inviting me to their raid (56:28 - 56:33)
there is none of that in diamond and (56:31 - 56:36)
pearl it is it is (56:33 - 56:37)
like (56:36 - 56:40)
old school and maybe people like that it (56:37 - 56:42)
is old school of like (56:40 - 56:44)
i need to search forever in the (56:42 - 56:46)
underground for one single pokemon and (56:44 - 56:47)
then i gotta go up and i gotta breed it (56:46 - 56:49)
because they've only given me the middle (56:47 - 56:52)
evolution and half of this pokedex is (56:49 - 56:54)
trade evolutions at this point and half (56:52 - 56:55)
this pokedex needs (56:54 - 56:57)
the dark (56:55 - 57:00)
claw or dusk stone or like or i need six (56:57 - 57:02)
moonstones but the only way i can do (57:00 - 57:03)
that is by going to the cave and (57:02 - 57:04)
thiefing (57:03 - 57:07)
clefairies for six and a half hours like (57:04 - 57:10)
the pokedex isn't even for me fun to (57:07 - 57:12)
complete and then you look at the (57:10 - 57:14)
competitive sense of things (57:12 - 57:17)
again in ultrasound ultra moon at the (57:14 - 57:19)
time they really pushed the boundaries (57:17 - 57:21)
to lower those barriers to get you into (57:19 - 57:24)
competitive um and then in sword and (57:21 - 57:25)
shield they were like we're crushing (57:24 - 57:28)
that even more and we're making it even (57:25 - 57:30)
easier to get into competitive and then (57:28 - 57:32)
they took it a step further with isle of (57:30 - 57:34)
armor and crown tundra and they're like (57:32 - 57:35)
where (57:34 - 57:36)
we really want you to get into (57:35 - 57:39)
competitive how else can we make this (57:36 - 57:41)
easy and then diamond and pearl was like (57:39 - 57:43)
we do not want you to ever (57:41 - 57:44)
buy (57:43 - 57:46)
earthquake as a tm (57:44 - 57:49)
and you only get one of them and it's 80 (57:46 - 57:51)
battle points so you can spend six hours (57:49 - 57:53)
trying to get 80 battle points for (57:51 - 57:54)
earthquake (57:53 - 57:56)
or you can spend another seven hour like (57:54 - 57:59)
you can't even get good iv pokemon (57:56 - 58:01)
through the system they do (57:59 - 58:03)
with like (58:01 - 58:05)
in sword and shield i could just go like (58:03 - 58:06)
i need a i need like i need a good (58:05 - 58:08)
durant for competitive oh there's a (58:06 - 58:10)
durant raid right here guaranteed for (58:08 - 58:13)
ivs oh after i complete the raid i can (58:10 - 58:15)
power it up to 100 take it to the place (58:13 - 58:18)
bottle cap two of them (58:15 - 58:19)
okay we're good to go like i have (58:18 - 58:21)
unlimited tms (58:19 - 58:23)
like i have played this game for a (58:21 - 58:25)
hundred hours (58:23 - 58:27)
i have not gotten a single pokemon to (58:25 - 58:30)
level 100 i don't know how to do it (58:27 - 58:32)
i was like i'll grind pachuricu in the (58:30 - 58:34)
underground that ain't happening do the (58:32 - 58:35)
gym leader rematches that ain't (58:34 - 58:38)
happening like and i did the math i did (58:35 - 58:41)
the math getting like 1400 experience (58:38 - 58:43)
from pacharisu (58:41 - 58:46)
i battle battle uh what's his name roark (58:43 - 58:49)
tyranitar 4000 experience great next (58:46 - 58:51)
pokemon 1200 next pokemon 1200 next (58:49 - 58:54)
pokemon 1100 next pokemon 1200 you're (58:51 - 58:56)
better off doing pachirisu you just are (58:54 - 58:58)
yeah like and pacharisu is not even the (58:56 - 59:00)
best pokemon in the underground like (58:58 - 59:01)
actually houndoom gives more experience (59:00 - 59:03)
it gives it gives you 1400 i think (59:01 - 59:05)
pacherisa gives you 1300 (59:03 - 59:08)
like (59:05 - 59:08)
the post game part (59:09 - 59:15)
of diamond and pearl just doesn't do it (59:12 - 59:17)
for me but like i said earlier if you're (59:15 - 59:19)
into shiny hunting yeah the game's fine (59:17 - 59:21)
if you're into just playing the game (59:19 - 59:22)
from start to finish and experience the (59:21 - 59:25)
story the game is fine (59:22 - 59:27)
um it's just all these little things (59:25 - 59:29)
that like i am looking for as a hardcore (59:27 - 59:30)
player (59:29 - 59:33)
is like they just dropped the ball on (59:30 - 59:36)
in in the weight of like quote unquote (59:33 - 59:38)
faithful no you can't say a game is (59:36 - 59:41)
faithful put bottle caps in and ability (59:38 - 59:42)
patches in (59:41 - 59:43)
and then (59:42 - 59:45)
decide to ignore everything else that (59:43 - 59:47)
made recent pokemon games great you (59:45 - 59:48)
don't you don't get to wait i mean they (59:47 - 59:52)
got away with it but it's unacceptable (59:48 - 59:52)
i mean i got away with it because (59:52 - 59:56)
there's no competitive but also there (59:54 - 59:59)
are certain things that like i am (59:56 - 60:01)
actively trying to get my hands on moon (59:59 - 60:05)
stones and is they (60:01 - 60:05)
it's when they cut back on quality of (60:05 - 60:09)
life things too far the fact that i (60:07 - 60:13)
can't go somewhere post game (60:09 - 60:15)
and by evolution stones (60:13 - 60:17)
that i'm forced to go into the (60:15 - 60:19)
underground for a random chance to find (60:17 - 60:23)
them or i have to spend as i have been (60:19 - 60:27)
hours and hours and hours in (60:23 - 60:29)
mount coronet trying to steal from (60:27 - 60:32)
clefairy to get an evolution stone (60:29 - 60:35)
like that too these aren't fun things (60:32 - 60:36)
just think how happy you'll be when you (60:35 - 60:40)
get it but it's i'm not because the time (60:36 - 60:44)
the time to reward ratio is terrible you (60:40 - 60:47)
need to reorient your joy i've gotten (60:44 - 60:49)
three of them (60:47 - 60:50)
and i'm like well i need to get (60:49 - 60:53)
at least two more for everything that (60:50 - 60:56)
needs a moonstone so i'm back here (60:53 - 60:58)
for x amount of hours and the thing is (60:56 - 60:59)
is i do it while i'm watching tv so i (60:58 - 61:01)
can't even really say that i'm enjoying (60:59 - 61:02)
the game (61:01 - 61:04)
i'm doing literally anything else while (61:02 - 61:06)
i keep my hands busy grinding in a game (61:04 - 61:09)
classic pokemon that classic pokemon (61:06 - 61:11)
experience it is classic pokemon (61:09 - 61:13)
experience that we've moved past and (61:11 - 61:16)
that's sort of what you have not me (61:13 - 61:19)
yeah i'm still there so you also play at (61:16 - 61:22)
a freaking snails pace exactly like you (61:19 - 61:25)
play for exactly two minutes a day and (61:22 - 61:26)
you're like well that's the two minutes (61:25 - 61:28)
of excitement i have in mind i play for (61:26 - 61:30)
45 minutes a day (61:28 - 61:34)
yeah that's nothing (61:30 - 61:34)
see you just bring that brings up like (61:34 - 61:37)
makes me think about the underground and (61:36 - 61:39)
the statue stuff (61:37 - 61:42)
i have never expanded my statue base i (61:39 - 61:44)
have the smallest base possible (61:42 - 61:47)
and i have almost every type and i (61:44 - 61:49)
haven't even farmed that many statues (61:47 - 61:51)
and if you put a bunch of like (61:49 - 61:54)
gligars and gar chops in your base (61:51 - 61:55)
you'll see that little thing that (61:54 - 61:57)
increases and it's like it's like one (61:55 - 61:59)
arrow two arrow three arrow three arrows (61:57 - 62:02)
max yeah so i i can max i can get the (61:59 - 62:04)
three arrows without expanding my base (62:02 - 62:06)
but just by putting the 16 guard chomp (62:04 - 62:07)
statues i have because i keep getting (62:06 - 62:10)
garchomp and so now i have max ground (62:07 - 62:12)
and i'm running around and it just (62:10 - 62:14)
doesn't feel like it does anything like (62:12 - 62:17)
i'm looking looking for gastrodon and (62:14 - 62:18)
it's like (62:17 - 62:21)
i max i put put all the vaporeons in (62:18 - 62:23)
okay now i have max max water and no (62:21 - 62:25)
gastrodon are spawning and i put all the (62:23 - 62:27)
guard chomps in and now it's like max (62:25 - 62:28)
ground you can only do one type you (62:27 - 62:30)
can't like ground water (62:28 - 62:32)
and gastronom's not spawning and it's (62:30 - 62:34)
like i have no reason to expand the base (62:32 - 62:36)
because why would i because i can only (62:34 - 62:39)
put statues in and i already have it (62:36 - 62:40)
can't go to four it can't go to f it can (62:39 - 62:42)
only go to three i can do three in the (62:40 - 62:44)
small space what am i getting these (62:42 - 62:46)
statues for what are they actually doing (62:44 - 62:48)
why do i care like (62:46 - 62:51)
i don't want to keep farming into the i (62:48 - 62:53)
just want a sunstone i don't even know (62:51 - 62:56)
where that is i'm just sick of getting (62:53 - 62:57)
anaerous (62:56 - 62:58)
fossils and (62:57 - 63:02)
lucario statues i i cannot do anything (62:58 - 63:06)
with these i need money give me nuggets (63:02 - 63:07)
give me (63:06 - 63:09)
like literally anything else and the (63:07 - 63:11)
game is just like (63:09 - 63:14)
this is what you get to do post game i'm (63:11 - 63:17)
over it like i have even with max raid (63:14 - 63:19)
battles i was like (63:17 - 63:20)
cool i don't have this pokemon hey this (63:19 - 63:22)
could be hidden ability hey even though (63:20 - 63:26)
i do not need this ludacholo i want the (63:22 - 63:28)
i want the hydro pump it's going to drop (63:26 - 63:29)
i want the i want the candy it's gonna (63:28 - 63:31)
drop i want the chance of a bottle cap (63:29 - 63:33)
it's gonna drop like (63:31 - 63:36)
there's just such a disconnect in like (63:33 - 63:38)
the (63:36 - 63:40)
every pokemon game is incredibly (63:38 - 63:42)
repetitive there is a loop that you go (63:40 - 63:44)
through this is not exclusive to pokemon (63:42 - 63:46)
this is exclusive like final fantasy 14 (63:44 - 63:48)
has this diablo has this halo has this (63:46 - 63:50)
destiny has this (63:48 - 63:52)
league of legends has this every game (63:50 - 63:56)
has a loop and the the loop of serotonin (63:52 - 63:58)
you get in diamond and pearl is like (63:56 - 64:02)
non-existent it is just frustration (63:58 - 64:02)
sword and shield is very good (64:04 - 64:08)
uh (64:06 - 64:10)
yeah i mean i've also and you're like (64:08 - 64:12)
you had the leafstone problem i'm i have (64:10 - 64:14)
a sunstone problem i have so many stuns (64:12 - 64:16)
sunstones that i found in the (64:14 - 64:17)
underground i can't find a single (64:16 - 64:18)
moonstone in there (64:17 - 64:23)
but i got nothing but sunstones (64:18 - 64:23)
why (64:24 - 64:27)
what tinker's trading i guess and why (64:25 - 64:29)
don't the vendors (64:27 - 64:32)
down there sell stones (64:29 - 64:32)
they sell tms which used to be unlimited (64:32 - 64:37)
for 24 years and for whatever reason (64:35 - 64:39)
they're not unlimited in this game can't (64:37 - 64:41)
one of them sell me well well since (64:39 - 64:42)
black and white (64:41 - 64:44)
please (64:42 - 64:45)
like (64:44 - 64:46)
and people like i can't believe you hate (64:45 - 64:48)
these games so much i don't hate the (64:46 - 64:51)
games i have 90 hours into it but (64:48 - 64:53)
there's a frustration level (64:51 - 64:56)
that i hit with all pokemon games where (64:53 - 64:58)
i'm like i need to put this down for a (64:56 - 65:01)
while and i hit it faster in brilliant (64:58 - 65:02)
diamond shining pearl than i have in any (65:01 - 65:04)
previous game (65:02 - 65:07)
also to the people that are like (65:04 - 65:09)
pachirisu bad way to level up gym (65:07 - 65:11)
leaders bad way to level up i did do the (65:09 - 65:13)
math on all these there is there is a (65:11 - 65:16)
trainer in the post game area she has a (65:13 - 65:20)
uh ambipom a rapidash and a chansey (65:16 - 65:23)
she's like maybe the best for experience (65:20 - 65:24)
but you have to just like ride your bike (65:23 - 65:26)
back and forth hit the verse seeker (65:24 - 65:28)
battle her ride your bike back and i (65:26 - 65:30)
think the chance he gives like maybe (65:28 - 65:31)
three thousand (65:30 - 65:33)
but also at that point it's like well (65:31 - 65:34)
three thousand that's like two hound (65:33 - 65:36)
dooms so you could like take her to (65:34 - 65:37)
leave it (65:36 - 65:40)
um there's like a salamance trainer that (65:37 - 65:42)
somebody suggested it's not better than (65:40 - 65:43)
the chant like look you'd be like we'll (65:42 - 65:47)
battle the elite four like (65:43 - 65:47)
no again it's like the same gym leader (65:47 - 65:50)
problem it's like yeah i could battle (65:49 - 65:51)
the elite four but how am i supposed to (65:50 - 65:54)
get from 60 to 77 (65:51 - 65:56)
without grinding something (65:54 - 65:58)
and then the elite four yeah they give (65:56 - 66:00)
like decent experience they give like (65:58 - 66:02)
decent money (66:00 - 66:04)
but they also (66:02 - 66:06)
they also are annoying like they they do (66:04 - 66:09)
have strategies and setups and items and (66:06 - 66:11)
berries and they will waste your (66:09 - 66:12)
resources of like well i'll need to use (66:11 - 66:13)
a hyper potion or i'll need to use a (66:12 - 66:16)
revive like (66:13 - 66:18)
there is if you're just looking to level (66:16 - 66:20)
mindlessly the elite four is not the (66:18 - 66:22)
answer (66:20 - 66:24)
um and then there's also the like the (66:22 - 66:26)
money problem in the game (66:24 - 66:27)
which (66:26 - 66:29)
i think again i talk about this a lot (66:27 - 66:31)
people sometimes overlook the economy of (66:29 - 66:33)
a video game and the economy of a video (66:31 - 66:36)
game is very important like if i (66:33 - 66:38)
run out of money that's a problem if i (66:36 - 66:40)
have too much money that's a problem (66:38 - 66:43)
there should be a good loop of like my (66:40 - 66:46)
time spent earning getting this money is (66:43 - 66:48)
worth it for my time spent what i'm (66:46 - 66:50)
spending the money on and that should go (66:48 - 66:52)
in a full circle and i think sword and (66:50 - 66:54)
shield really did a good job (66:52 - 66:56)
with that economy not only were there (66:54 - 66:59)
different ways to make money but there (66:56 - 67:01)
was different (66:59 - 67:03)
there were there were different ways you (67:01 - 67:05)
could make money per your enjoyment if (67:03 - 67:07)
you wanted to go the luxury ball route (67:05 - 67:09)
or if you wanted to like go the digger (67:07 - 67:11)
duo route or if you wanted to go the (67:09 - 67:14)
like just battle the champion like (67:11 - 67:16)
there's multiple ways to make money in (67:14 - 67:19)
this game there's one way to make money (67:16 - 67:22)
and it's the two old people down by the (67:19 - 67:23)
trophy garden (67:22 - 67:25)
they give you twenty four thousand (67:23 - 67:27)
dollars with amulet coin once you catch (67:25 - 67:28)
heatran for whatever reason when you (67:27 - 67:30)
catch heatran you get more money from (67:28 - 67:32)
those people (67:30 - 67:34)
and (67:32 - 67:36)
they could easily (67:34 - 67:37)
make this game (67:36 - 67:38)
better (67:37 - 67:41)
if they were like version 1.1.4 let's (67:38 - 67:43)
replace the roselia and the chat that (67:41 - 67:46)
these two old people have with a chansey (67:43 - 67:49)
and a blissey they fix so many problems (67:46 - 67:51)
by doing that of like not only are you (67:49 - 67:53)
getting 24k (67:51 - 67:54)
per (67:53 - 67:55)
and for the rec i'm pretty sure the (67:54 - 67:58)
elite four members give you 26k so in (67:55 - 67:59)
your head think about this i can knock (67:58 - 68:02)
out one chat for 24k or i can suffer (67:59 - 68:05)
through aaron aaron's six bug team (68:02 - 68:08)
pokemon for 26k like (68:05 - 68:10)
like the time spent per money you're (68:08 - 68:12)
better off just knocking out the chat (68:10 - 68:16)
but if they gave those people one obli (68:12 - 68:18)
and won a chancy not only would you be (68:16 - 68:20)
getting like three to six thousand (68:18 - 68:21)
experience depending on blissey or (68:20 - 68:23)
chansey you would also get that money (68:21 - 68:24)
and it would fix the leveling problem in (68:23 - 68:26)
the game and it would like make the (68:24 - 68:28)
money problem more enjoyable there is (68:26 - 68:30)
one blissey trainer in this entire game (68:28 - 68:33)
and they are in victory road and verse (68:30 - 68:36)
seeker does not work in caves it is (68:33 - 68:37)
so (68:36 - 68:39)
mind-blowing and frustrating that that (68:37 - 68:41)
like that was a like a conscious choice (68:39 - 68:44)
that was made (68:41 - 68:44)
and then people are like well you're (68:47 - 68:53)
just hard on the games like (68:48 - 68:54)
do you know how many times i battled (68:53 - 68:58)
charles and his gosh darn chat i'm sick (68:54 - 69:00)
of seeing them (68:58 - 69:01)
you like this channel no way to make (69:00 - 69:04)
money (69:01 - 69:04)
there's just no way to make money in the (69:04 - 69:08)
game (69:06 - 69:08)
question of the week (69:11 - 69:14)
all right (69:18 - 69:24)

week (69:24 - 69:28)
[Music] (69:25 - 69:30)

you post this on wednesday so everybody (69:34 - 69:38)
should be proud of me (69:36 - 69:41)
this is from dudley if you were a battle (69:38 - 69:43)
if you were a frontier brain (69:41 - 69:46)
what would your title be factory head (69:43 - 69:48)
dome ace arcade (69:46 - 69:50)
arcade star tower tycoon and what would (69:48 - 69:52)
your battle your battle facilities (69:50 - 69:55)
gimmick be (69:52 - 69:55)
i'm not too familiar with the the battle (69:58 - 70:01)
frontier (70:00 - 70:04)
stuff that was uh that was uh emerald (70:01 - 70:05)
right yeah (70:04 - 70:08)
um oof god there's so many good options (70:05 - 70:10)
so definitely i would have a whole like (70:08 - 70:12)
i would my whole thing would be bring (70:10 - 70:14)
back rotation battles so my gimmick (70:12 - 70:17)
would be rotation battles (70:14 - 70:18)
because nobody uses them but i'm trying (70:17 - 70:22)
to think of what what like what would my (70:18 - 70:24)
what would my (70:22 - 70:26)
building look like (70:24 - 70:28)
because they were always like (70:26 - 70:31)
you know tower tycoon in fact like (70:28 - 70:34)
nolan was in a factory and (70:31 - 70:37)
uh tucker was in the dome (70:34 - 70:38)
uh (70:37 - 70:40)
brandon's like the pyramid yeah brian (70:38 - 70:42)
had a pyramid uh annabelle was in the (70:40 - 70:46)
salon spencer was in the palace (70:42 - 70:46)
maybe to put it in a castle (70:50 - 70:56)
fit my fit my whole dnd theme (70:52 - 70:56)
so you would have like a chest not a (70:57 - 71:03)
dell fox uh yeah and uh greninja (70:59 - 71:07)
is the ninja d character yeah the rogue (71:03 - 71:08)

and rowell it's a ranger uh-huh (71:08 - 71:14)
primarina's the bard (71:11 - 71:14)
that's a pretty good theme (71:15 - 71:18)
uh (71:17 - 71:19)
uh (71:18 - 71:21)
monk (71:19 - 71:23)

yeah (71:26 - 71:29)
i mean there's a lot like the there's (71:27 - 71:31)
the sick those six stars is all sort of (71:29 - 71:34)
like the d and d classic (71:31 - 71:34)
uh (71:34 - 71:37)
ones so i would probably be uh (71:34 - 71:41)
but yeah i would say castle king (71:37 - 71:43)
uh and it'll be rotation battles it (71:41 - 71:46)
would all be d and d themed (71:43 - 71:48)
that's my answer welcome to welcome to (71:46 - 71:50)
my battle frontier (71:48 - 71:52)
that's pretty good i like that (71:50 - 71:53)
i feel like wills would be like a (71:52 - 71:56)
workout gym nope (71:53 - 71:58)
skate park (71:56 - 71:59)
no (71:58 - 72:02)
thrasher ace will uh it would be based (71:59 - 72:04)
on (72:02 - 72:06)
of course i can't think of the word (72:04 - 72:07)
what is it called when you kind of like (72:06 - 72:10)
get rid of all the unnecessary things (72:07 - 72:12)
and you only keep the essentials (72:10 - 72:16)
in your life minimalism minimalism marie (72:12 - 72:17)
condo (72:16 - 72:20)
ah so it'd be like (72:17 - 72:22)
minimalist design (72:20 - 72:23)
will (72:22 - 72:25)
and i'd have they would approach a (72:23 - 72:27)
square box it would basically be a tiny (72:25 - 72:30)
house or a container (72:27 - 72:32)
yeah you can bring one pokemon in here (72:30 - 72:34)
and it can only no matter be very like (72:32 - 72:38)
refined nice shaker furniture (72:34 - 72:41)
shaker stat and uh it would be like yes (72:38 - 72:43)
it would be what you get one pokemon you (72:41 - 72:45)
have to pick your essential pokemon that (72:43 - 72:47)
is the most important to you (72:45 - 72:50)
and i will pick one pokemon and we shall (72:47 - 72:52)
battle (72:50 - 72:52)
the single single battle and that (72:54 - 72:57)
pokemon can only one pokemon that (72:55 - 73:00)
pokemon can only know metronome (72:57 - 73:02)
[Laughter] (73:00 - 73:06)
one move metronome (73:02 - 73:06)
do you and this is like an anime thing (73:07 - 73:14)
but i remember when like ash battled (73:10 - 73:16)
misty (73:14 - 73:19)
and they battled (73:16 - 73:19)
because that's happened a bunch (73:20 - 73:24)
they battled in her her so the cerulean (73:21 - 73:25)
gym in the pool (73:24 - 73:26)
yeah in the aquarium (73:25 - 73:28)
and i thought it was so cool that like (73:26 - 73:31)
he had to be like well i can't i (73:28 - 73:33)
like (73:31 - 73:35)
i need a pokemon that can like stand on (73:33 - 73:36)
this platform or i just need a pokemon (73:35 - 73:39)
that can straight up swim (73:36 - 73:42)
um and then i think about like later on (73:39 - 73:44)
when he gets to like this is like the (73:42 - 73:45)
indigo league when he gets like the (73:44 - 73:47)
elite four or not the elite four but (73:45 - 73:49)
like he's in that tournament (73:47 - 73:50)
and the terrain (73:49 - 73:52)
like made him (73:50 - 73:55)
question his pokemon choices (73:52 - 73:57)
it's it's weird to me that there's not (73:55 - 73:59)
like you walk into a water gym and (73:57 - 74:01)
they're like oh (73:59 - 74:02)
this is an aquarium fight so you can (74:01 - 74:04)
only use like i guess i kind of did that (74:02 - 74:06)
in x and y with like sky battles yeah so (74:04 - 74:09)
yeah they did it so badly you saw your (74:06 - 74:12)
sky battle with kramer ant yeah (74:09 - 74:16)
what's your what's your place look like (74:12 - 74:16)
i wanted to look like the (74:18 - 74:23)
we'll do sky battles we'll do sky (74:21 - 74:24)
battles okay so you're only limited (74:23 - 74:26)
birds (74:24 - 74:28)
um or i think i can levitate because (74:26 - 74:30)
that was that counted yeah that counted (74:28 - 74:32)
too yeah yeah but halluccio could not (74:30 - 74:36)
perform his sky battles (74:32 - 74:36)
um i wanted to look like the giant (74:39 - 74:45)
pyramid ship in destiny (74:41 - 74:45)
i don't know what that looks at natural (74:46 - 74:49)
to get up ship you mean oh the bad guys (74:47 - 74:52)
like the bad bad guys (74:49 - 74:52)
the bad bad guys i don't need to get (74:53 - 74:56)
back into destiny but i don't want to (74:54 - 74:57)
pay for it (74:56 - 75:00)
nah it's free is it destiny 1 or destiny (74:57 - 75:02)
2. destiny 2 (75:00 - 75:04)
pyramids (75:02 - 75:06)
is it this sort of big (75:04 - 75:07)
uh it's basically just a big black (75:06 - 75:10)
pyramid yeah this is (75:07 - 75:12)
cool yeah (75:10 - 75:14)
all right so so they see the shadow on (75:12 - 75:16)
the ground and then you teleport them up (75:14 - 75:18)
yeah because the pyramid is also (75:16 - 75:19)
levitating right (75:18 - 75:22)
so you walk under it and there's like a (75:19 - 75:23)
little teleportation circle and you go (75:22 - 75:24)
up to face (75:23 - 75:27)
what is your title (75:24 - 75:27)
uh (75:28 - 75:32)
[Music] (75:29 - 75:34)
what are they called bird keepers in the (75:32 - 75:35)
game yes (75:34 - 75:38)
that's a bad title it is (75:35 - 75:39)
but would you be pyramid because there's (75:38 - 75:42)
already a pyramid king brandon (75:39 - 75:43)
so (75:42 - 75:44)
um (75:43 - 75:47)
what what are the ships levitation (75:44 - 75:51)
guru oh there we go levitation guru (75:47 - 75:53)
i don't like the word guru (75:51 - 75:55)
levitation master (75:53 - 75:57)
yeah i guess that's okay i feel like (75:55 - 75:59)
master is very generic but that's a very (75:57 - 76:01)
pokemon word they like the word thug for (75:59 - 76:04)
bad guys like yeah master for (76:01 - 76:06)
well you could also be an ace levitation (76:04 - 76:09)

the darkness (76:28 - 76:31)
um don't want to go too long so uh one (76:31 - 76:35)
question of the week this week uh will (76:34 - 76:37)
what's our pokemon of the week all right (76:35 - 76:38)
last week's pokemon of the week was a (76:37 - 76:40)
really short clue i'll just read it (76:38 - 76:43)
again in december 2020 the last (76:40 - 76:45)
evolution of this line was featured in (76:43 - 76:48)
december 2021 the first in the line was (76:45 - 76:50)
featured what is the middle evolution (76:48 - 76:53)
whose alternate form is not available in (76:50 - 76:55)
sinnoh but is available in kanto for (76:53 - 76:59)
this pokemon line (76:55 - 76:59)
[Music] (77:00 - 77:06)
torah cat (77:03 - 77:06)
that's not available in sinnoh (77:07 - 77:12)
it's graveler graveler is the correct (77:09 - 77:14)
answer sir yes congratulations didn't we (77:12 - 77:16)
just do geodude the other day that's the (77:14 - 77:20)
whole point of the clue my friend (77:16 - 77:20)
i will say i often like my middle (77:21 - 77:25)
evolutions (77:24 - 77:27)
i am not a fan of the middle evolution (77:25 - 77:29)
of (77:27 - 77:32)
regular graveler but i love the alolan (77:29 - 77:35)
version yeah the old one's good i really (77:32 - 77:36)
like the alolan and i don't really know (77:35 - 77:37)
like (77:36 - 77:39)
maybe it's the spikies (77:37 - 77:41)
that make it feel sort of (77:39 - 77:44)
rocky extra uh the shuffle icon is (77:41 - 77:47)
outstanding as always (77:44 - 77:49)
i think it's because it's got this angry (77:47 - 77:51)
unibrow that i'm really into (77:49 - 77:54)
yeah the unibrow is good and it's got a (77:51 - 77:56)
brill it's the little gold nugget is so (77:54 - 77:59)
cute (77:56 - 77:59)
uh know that the pokemon has the same (78:00 - 78:04)
type combination as a lowland graveler (78:01 - 78:06)
graveler is very similar to bulldog both (78:04 - 78:08)
a rock type pokemon introduced in a nod (78:06 - 78:10)
number of generations base that total of (78:08 - 78:14)
390 evolve at 25 then can evolve again (78:10 - 78:15)
at trading (78:14 - 78:18)
alone graveler and its evolutionary (78:15 - 78:20)
relatives were divided by hito well we (78:18 - 78:22)
talked about this last time with them (78:20 - 78:25)
dude (78:22 - 78:25)
gravel is the only pokemon unavailable (78:28 - 78:32)
using the pika cup (78:30 - 78:34)
what's the pika cup (78:32 - 78:40)
it was a certain stadium cup in stadium (78:34 - 78:40)
hmm (78:41 - 78:43)
that's all you got (78:42 - 78:46)
that's all i got nothing all right greg (78:43 - 78:50)
get ready to take notes okay hold on (78:46 - 78:50)
i recently have been listening to the (78:51 - 78:57)
pokemon podcast series sincerely sinnoh (78:53 - 78:59)
and increasingly have been motivated to (78:57 - 79:01)
write a dear idiots letter to the two (78:59 - 79:03)
hosts of the program for the number of (79:01 - 79:05)
misunderstandings they have about the (79:03 - 79:07)
brilliant diamond and shining pearl (79:05 - 79:09)
pokemon video games (79:07 - 79:12)
this morning i heard them describe their (79:09 - 79:14)
experiences in the cantalave city gym (79:12 - 79:16)
where they encountered a former water (79:14 - 79:20)
type pokemon which according to them (79:16 - 79:22)
does not match the steel type of the gym (79:20 - 79:24)
they even went so far to state that the (79:22 - 79:27)
pokemon is now actually weak to steel (79:24 - 79:29)
type and was only included to contribute (79:27 - 79:32)
towards the player's pokedex completion (79:29 - 79:34)
completely ignoring that this is nothing (79:32 - 79:37)
new many pokemon even going back to the (79:34 - 79:39)
pewter city gym included type (79:37 - 79:41)
effectiveness weaknesses (79:39 - 79:43)
if they had only bothered to scratch the (79:41 - 79:46)
slightest bit beneath the surface they (79:43 - 79:47)
would have realized that the pokemon (79:46 - 79:49)
they so willfully maligned could (79:47 - 79:53)
actually learn a steel type move ah (79:49 - 79:55)
iron tail i don't know why i wrote aqua (79:53 - 79:56)
tail iron tail (79:55 - 79:59)
via tm in brilliant diamond and shining (79:56 - 80:01)
pearl and can also learn another steel (79:59 - 80:04)
type move steel roller via move tutor in (80:01 - 80:06)
sword and shield (80:04 - 80:09)
unfortunately because the dubious duo (80:06 - 80:12)
recording the sincerely sinnoh podcast (80:09 - 80:14)
have so many inaccurate and problematic (80:12 - 80:17)
opinions i neither have sufficient time (80:14 - 80:20)
nor blue ink to pen a corrective missive (80:17 - 80:24)
that is your clue for the week thank you (80:20 - 80:27)
look at him reach look at him reach for (80:24 - 80:29)
