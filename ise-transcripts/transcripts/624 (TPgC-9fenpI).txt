you might not want a camera in your face (1:57 - 2:00)
so to (1:59 - 2:03)
combat the not wanting a camera in your (2:00 - 2:06)
face we will be doing a big group meet (2:03 - 2:08)
up on (2:06 - 2:10)
Sunday uh I think we&#39;re going to plan a (2:08 - 2:13)
meeting at the Apple Store right out of (2:10 - 2:15)
Central Park which one is that fifth a I (2:13 - 2:17)
think so the big glass cube yeah the big (2:15 - 2:20)
glass cube um I&#39;m not going to say (2:17 - 2:22)
Central Park well it&#39;s across the street (2:20 - 2:23)
from Central Park because Central Park (2:22 - 2:27)
is so big so I think it&#39;s easier just to (2:23 - 2:29)
meet at the giant cube acoss plent of (2:27 - 2:32)
standing room there almost all the stor (2:29 - 2:35)
is underground yeah so we&#39;re going to do (2:32 - 2:37)
that noon on Sunday that gives you time (2:35 - 2:41)
to get breakfast that gives you time to (2:37 - 2:45)
sleep in so noon on Sunday if you listen (2:41 - 2:47)
to this podcast if you&#39;re in the slack (2:45 - 2:50)
if you&#39;re in the Discord the Apple Store (2:47 - 2:53)

camera that does the little Polaroids so (3:01 - 3:06)

housekeeping or house cleaning um I made (7:39 - 7:46)
the internet mad this weekend yay you&#39;ve (7:43 - 7:50)
made it I I did it I made them mad I so (7:46 - 7:55)
I bought a bunch of stuff in Japan and d (7:50 - 7:58)
and I like to film with natural sunlight (7:55 - 8:01)
so it really makes filming days quite (7:58 - 8:03)
hard if the sun isn&#39;t hitting my like (8:01 - 8:05)
Kitchen in a certain (8:03 - 8:08)
way I totally understand this for taking (8:05 - 8:09)
pictures of things sometimes with (8:08 - 8:13)
natural light uh I had like a I had like (8:09 - 8:15)
a 20 minute window yesterday so I&#39;m like (8:13 - 8:17)
filming as fast as possible stuff I got (8:15 - 8:19)
from Japan one of them is like a knacki (8:17 - 8:21)
salt (8:19 - 8:25)
shaker those are so good I I wanted one (8:21 - 8:26)
of those the moment I saw that they (8:25 - 8:28)
existed yeah when you&#39;re done talking (8:26 - 8:30)
about this I have to tell you about the (8:28 - 8:32)
reaction I had to what you&#39;re about (8:30 - 8:36)
to okay so if you&#39;ve never seen my like (8:32 - 8:38)
Instagram Tik Tok whatever it&#39;s usually (8:36 - 8:43)
I ASMR it wasn&#39;t planned to be ASMR when (8:38 - 8:45)
I was filming it I always planed to put (8:43 - 8:47)
music but like the one time I forgot to (8:45 - 8:49)
add music it like popped off so I was (8:47 - 8:50)
like oh I guess I&#39;m not using music I&#39;ll (8:49 - 8:54)
just keep the like better like it&#39;s (8:50 - 8:57)
better that way it&#39;s great I love it uh (8:54 - 8:59)
so I I dropped the salt shaker I opened (8:57 - 9:00)
it up the (8:59 - 9:03)
crinkles of opening it and then it&#39;s a (9:00 - 9:05)
salt shaker right like there&#39;s nothing (9:03 - 9:09)
to really show it&#39;s it looks like nackle (9:05 - 9:11)
and it&#39;s a salt shaker and like when I&#39;m (9:09 - 9:13)
opening like one of these like $100 (9:11 - 9:16)
pokeballs right like they it has buttons (9:13 - 9:18)
it has s like it has different modes so (9:16 - 9:21)
like it&#39;s a better opening experience I (9:18 - 9:23)
get I I guess because there&#39;s like a (9:21 - 9:25)
stand and it has lights and so I was (9:23 - 9:27)
like okay well I&#39;m going to fill the (9:25 - 9:29)
salt shaker and then I thought that was (9:27 - 9:31)
like a really lame ending to the video (9:29 - 9:34)
of like f filling the salt shaker with (9:31 - 9:36)
salt and not using it so here&#39;s the (9:34 - 9:39)
behind the scenes I fill the salt shaker (9:36 - 9:41)
I&#39;m recording and then I go well I (9:39 - 9:43)
should salt (9:41 - 9:45)
something and I open my fridge and if (9:43 - 9:47)
you know anything about me there is (9:45 - 9:50)
nothing in my fridge it is like a bottle (9:47 - 9:54)
of ketchup uh for some reason a one (9:50 - 9:57)
random lemon uh a bunch of soilent (9:54 - 10:00)
absolutely nothing in my fridge and (9:57 - 10:03)
I just don&#39;t keep food in my house so (10:00 - 10:05)
the one thing in my fridge is I had (10:03 - 10:07)
three day old Little (10:05 - 10:10)
Caesar that I was about to throw out no (10:07 - 10:11)
so I (10:10 - 10:13)
thought well if I throw the Little (10:11 - 10:15)
Caesars in the microwave for like 20 (10:13 - 10:18)
seconds it will look fresh again that is (10:15 - 10:20)
like the power of Little Caesar&#39;s Pizza (10:18 - 10:22)
it looked (10:20 - 10:25)
fresh give him that so I warmed up the (10:22 - 10:28)
Little Caesars and then I salted the (10:25 - 10:30)
pizza cuz I&#39;m like I&#39;m not going to eat (10:28 - 10:33)
this but I need to Salt something and (10:30 - 10:35)
then I also thought oh I think people (10:33 - 10:36)
are going to freak out that I&#39;m salting (10:35 - 10:39)
a pizza and that&#39;s what I did and then (10:36 - 10:41)
as soon as the video was over I threw (10:39 - 10:43)
the Salted slice of pizza back in the (10:41 - 10:45)
box and then I walked it out to the (10:43 - 10:47)
trash because I was like cleaning my (10:45 - 10:49)
house (10:47 - 10:53)
yesterday and man putting salt on Pizza (10:49 - 10:56)
really made people upset mhm but I (10:53 - 10:59)
didn&#39;t eat it okay I&#39;m so curious about (10:56 - 11:02)
what it would have tasted like though (10:59 - 11:03)
terrible I&#39;m sure it would have tasted (11:02 - 11:05)
terrible not necessarily plenty of the (11:03 - 11:08)
things you put on pizza are salty okay (11:05 - 11:09)
but also three-day old Little Caesar&#39;s (11:08 - 11:12)
pizza I like maybe if it was like yeah (11:09 - 11:14)
maybe if it was like fresher Pizza I (11:12 - 11:16)
would have tried it okay let me give you (11:14 - 11:19)
the point of view from a viewer (11:16 - 11:24)
who saw this yesterday so I was going to (11:19 - 11:26)
GameStop to pick up some Pokemon cards (11:24 - 11:28)
as you do because it was the end of June (11:26 - 11:30)
end of the month I he was my discount (11:28 - 11:34)
yet anyways uh I get to GameStop and I (11:30 - 11:36)
park my car I open my phone and before I (11:34 - 11:37)
get out I&#39;m like well let me check (11:36 - 11:39)
Instagram real quick I don&#39;t know why (11:37 - 11:42)
because meta has created us choke hold (11:39 - 11:45)
on you yeah it&#39;s complete (11:42 - 11:47)
hold so I open Instagram and the first (11:45 - 11:49)
thing that pops up is Steve&#39;s video and (11:47 - 11:51)
I&#39;m like great another one of these (11:49 - 11:53)
videos love them let&#39;s see what he got I (11:51 - 11:56)
see that it&#39;s an AI uh thing I&#39;m like (11:53 - 11:57)
what is this it&#39;s a salt shaker I was (11:56 - 11:59)
like that makes complete sense this is (11:57 - 12:01)
wonderful I want this item this is great (11:59 - 12:05)
all good then I see the pizza and I (12:01 - 12:10)
think is is he about to put salt on a (12:05 - 12:14)
pizza what is what is he doing and so he (12:10 - 12:17)
puts salt on the pizza and I was like (12:14 - 12:19)
okay this must be like a Minnesota thing (12:17 - 12:21)
or something or a Wisconsin I don&#39;t know (12:19 - 12:23)
like I don&#39;t know where this thought of (12:21 - 12:25)
putting salt on a pizza comes from extra (12:23 - 12:28)
salt on a pizza um so I immediately hit (12:25 - 12:30)
to the comments right cuz I was about to (12:28 - 12:32)
be like oh it&#39;s one of those videos (12:30 - 12:34)
where you&#39;re like I need to go (12:32 - 12:37)
to well I was just curi I wasn&#39;t going (12:34 - 12:39)
to be like this is gross I was just (12:37 - 12:41)
curious like what did that taste like (12:39 - 12:43)
like what but then I started scrolling (12:41 - 12:45)
through the comments and there were so (12:43 - 12:48)
many people that were just like salt on (12:45 - 12:50)
Pizza really that I thought you know he (12:48 - 12:52)
doesn&#39;t need another comment from (12:50 - 12:56)
someone fine you can interact with (12:52 - 12:56)
it it was a shock to see (12:57 - 13:05)
that I don&#39;t I bet like sea salt on (13:01 - 13:07)
Pizza I bet there&#39;s like some company (13:05 - 13:09)
out there that does like a sea salt (13:07 - 13:11)
pizza and I bet it slaps I bet it&#39;s (13:09 - 13:14)
super good oh yeah I mean I I don&#39;t like (13:11 - 13:17)
pizza but a lot of the things that (13:14 - 13:20)
people put on pizza are salty I I don&#39;t (13:17 - 13:21)
like pizza I don&#39;t like the texture of (13:20 - 13:24)
the cheese never have not in my life (13:21 - 13:27)
have I ever liked Pizza yeah I mean the (13:24 - 13:29)
guy who just salted his pizza cannot (13:27 - 13:31)
critic someone else for not likeing I (13:29 - 13:32)
didn&#39;t eat the salt I didn&#39;t eat the (13:31 - 13:35)
salt it was I I&#39;m very curious (13:32 - 13:39)
now but but you put pepperoni as salty (13:35 - 13:42)
right when you yes that&#39;s yeah which is (13:39 - 13:43)
why the extra salt was like that&#39;s too (13:42 - 13:45)
much salt because you already have the (13:43 - 13:47)
saltiness of the (13:45 - 13:50)
pepperoni so I would also assume that (13:47 - 13:52)
like Little Caesar&#39;s Pizza is probably (13:50 - 13:55)
more salty yeah probably (13:52 - 13:58)
yeah lot of salt on there you put a lot (13:55 - 14:00)
of salt on yeah (13:58 - 14:01)
if you&#39;re if you&#39;re watching this (14:00 - 14:03)
podcast or listening to it like make (14:01 - 14:06)
sure to watch this video at some point (14:03 - 14:08)
after this podcast cuz I knew I was (14:06 - 14:12)
going to throw it out it&#39;s a lot of salt (14:08 - 14:13)
also (14:12 - 14:16)
like corporate greed hasn&#39;t hit salt yet (14:13 - 14:18)
so I think like a huge thing of salt is (14:16 - 14:21)
still like a19 so what the pepperonis (14:18 - 14:23)
they&#39;re like little boats and you just (14:21 - 14:27)
like filled one I feel like with (14:23 - 14:29)
salt you know when I was initially (14:27 - 14:31)
salted it I wasn&#39;t sure if it was going (14:29 - 14:32)
to get picked (14:31 - 14:35)
up by the like camera I wasn&#39;t sure if (14:32 - 14:37)
you&#39;d be able to like see the detail oh (14:35 - 14:39)

Caesars I I will say the warming the (15:02 - 15:07)
Little Caesars up made it look fresh yes (15:04 - 15:08)

honest I like because you had it on the (15:10 - 15:15)
you maybe you had it on a plate that was (15:12 - 15:17)
like a paper plate right it was a (15:15 - 15:19)
Pikachu plate oh was it a Pikachu plate (15:17 - 15:20)
whatever it was it made it look like I (15:19 - 15:22)
thought you had like I don&#39;t know taken (15:20 - 15:23)
it home from somewhere like you had just (15:22 - 15:26)
gotten home with it and then uh and then (15:23 - 15:28)
salted it which is why I assumed you ate (15:26 - 15:31)
it afterwards and I was so curious as to (15:28 - 15:33)
what just went out to get a fresh single (15:31 - 15:35)
slice of pizza to come back and put salt (15:33 - 15:37)

disappoint it&#39;s just that uh growth week (16:07 - 16:12)
is is going to start by the time this (16:10 - 16:14)
podcast goes up I want to talk about (16:12 - 16:16)
Elite raids (16:14 - 16:19)
because uh well first off did you guys (16:16 - 16:22)
do any Elite raids I did not I was at (16:19 - 16:28)
Pride I nice uh I did (16:22 - 16:31)
because well so one there was the (16:28 - 16:33)
research right and then there was also (16:31 - 16:36)
like a code for research so I saw the (16:33 - 16:39)
code go up for research and it said like (16:36 - 16:41)
oh you can get a meteorite and I was (16:39 - 16:42)
like oh cool like I&#39;ve already used the (16:41 - 16:45)
two I have on riques I&#39;m good like I (16:42 - 16:49)
don&#39;t need another mega Rayquaza um but (16:45 - 16:50)
I was like why not like look at a free (16:49 - 16:52)
medor right and then the research was (16:50 - 16:55)
like do an elite rate I was like wait a (16:52 - 16:58)
second they really wanted to do these on (16:55 - 17:00)
a meteorite without that like without me (16:58 - 17:02)
doing three Elite raids and then (17:00 - 17:06)
forgetting to like redeem the research (17:02 - 17:06)
no um but yeah so I did one and it was (17:06 - 17:13)
sort of just the last minute there (17:11 - 17:16)
happens to be a gym down the street from (17:13 - 17:20)
my house and it&#39;s very popular like it&#39;s (17:16 - 17:22)
just the middle of uh one of the (17:20 - 17:24)
neighborhoods the neighborhood I live in (17:22 - 17:26)
is a very popular neighborhood for this (17:24 - 17:28)
area of San Diego for Pokemon playing (17:26 - 17:29)
Pok√©mon go (17:28 - 17:33)
so um the gym down the street has (17:29 - 17:35)
typically has an elite raid and it was (17:33 - 17:38)
at like the five o&#39; one and I wasn&#39;t I (17:35 - 17:39)
totally forgot that Elite raids were (17:38 - 17:41)
even happening and then I opened slack (17:39 - 17:43)
and someone was like oh I just did an (17:41 - 17:45)
elite raid it was great and I looked at (17:43 - 17:46)
my phone I was like I&#39;ve got seven (17:45 - 17:48)
minutes I&#39;ll run down there and do that (17:46 - 17:51)
so um so I did do one and I got the (17:48 - 17:56)
researches completed but nice yeah (17:51 - 17:58)
mostly just because you live very close (17:56 - 18:01)
to a popular R location I mean I knew (17:58 - 18:02)
that I would be able to show up and (18:01 - 18:04)
there&#39;d be 20 people in like I it&#39;s just (18:02 - 18:08)
like it was it&#39;s like that so very lucky (18:04 - 18:10)
in the sense of where I happen to live (18:08 - 18:13)
that makes it so easy to do that I still (18:10 - 18:16)
think they&#39;re awful but oh man I I mean (18:13 - 18:19)
I&#39;ve been saying this for what six years (18:16 - 18:21)
that I loved ex raids that eventually (18:19 - 18:23)
turned into Elite raids MH cuz I just (18:21 - 18:26)
like love showing up at a set (18:23 - 18:29)
time and then knowing it&#39;ll get done (18:26 - 18:32)
have you ever gone to an elite raid (18:29 - 18:35)
where there weren&#39;t enough people yes no (18:32 - 18:37)
Steve I think that&#39;s be part of the (18:35 - 18:40)
difference no no I I know that probably (18:37 - 18:44)
exists it does it definitely does so (18:40 - 18:47)
like if you if you live in like okonak (18:44 - 18:51)
Wisconsin like I&#39;m sure the one Culver (18:47 - 18:53)
you have in your entire city might be an (18:51 - 18:55)
elite raid and then that that&#39;s it right (18:53 - 18:56)
and then you don&#39;t even know if like (18:55 - 18:58)
people are going to show up to that but (18:56 - 19:02)
like i&#39; I done Elite raids in like (18:58 - 19:05)
Chicago in Milwaukee here in Minneapolis (19:02 - 19:08)
and so like I just named three huge (19:05 - 19:10)
cities in the United (19:08 - 19:13)
States right (19:10 - 19:16)
like yeah and in the place where I live (19:13 - 19:18)
that&#39;s a small City there are a bunch of (19:16 - 19:20)
different locations for elite raids and (19:18 - 19:23)
if you coordinate you can absolutely get (19:20 - 19:25)
enough people to do the raids and maybe (19:23 - 19:27)
even kind of get a train going but if (19:25 - 19:29)
you go to the wrong one when everybody (19:27 - 19:31)
else is at a different one then you&#39;re (19:29 - 19:33)
out of (19:31 - 19:36)
luck I think I think Elite raids teach (19:33 - 19:40)
people the importance of time management (19:36 - 19:43)
it&#39;s like the thing that you don&#39;t want (19:40 - 19:45)
to be late to I think plenty of things (19:43 - 19:47)
in life teach people the importance of (19:45 - 19:49)
time management I think so to that point (19:47 - 19:52)
I will say again it&#39;s very dependent on (19:49 - 19:54)
where you live because tot for the (19:52 - 19:58)
enamor raids which were horribly set I (19:54 - 20:00)
get it was Valentine&#39;s Day blah loved it (19:58 - 20:03)
loved it loved it don&#39;t don&#39;t try to (20:00 - 20:05)
play up that Valentine&#39;s Day is an (20:03 - 20:09)
important holiday it&#39;s not it one of my (20:05 - 20:11)
favorite holidays it is one of my (20:09 - 20:13)
favorite holidays it can be a very good (20:11 - 20:16)
holiday you can have a nice dinner with (20:13 - 20:19)
your significant other or friends and (20:16 - 20:20)
any day it doesn&#39;t have you do that with (20:19 - 20:22)
any holiday you don&#39;t have to do the (20:20 - 20:24)
holiday on the day of the holiday yes (20:22 - 20:26)
it&#39;s also good to have a day where (20:24 - 20:30)
you&#39;re encouraged to to do things nice (20:26 - 20:31)
for people you care about including (20:30 - 20:33)
yourself because too often we forget (20:31 - 20:36)
that and so it&#39;s nice to have a reminder (20:33 - 20:39)
honestly in the pocket of big (20:36 - 20:41)
Hallmark usually I&#39;m the only one (20:39 - 20:44)
defending Valentine&#39;s Day I like this no (20:41 - 20:45)
it&#39;s great Valentine&#39;s Day is a great (20:44 - 20:47)
holiday I&#39;m sorry like again you don&#39;t (20:45 - 20:49)
have to celebrate it even on Valentine&#39;s (20:47 - 20:51)
Day but it&#39;s that reminder of like a (20:49 - 20:52)
thing that I think a lot of people (20:51 - 20:54)
forget this is not a topic I thought we (20:52 - 20:57)
were going to be going on this (20:54 - 21:02)
podcast but back to anamoros um I was (20:57 - 21:05)
ready to get to enamoras at 5:00 P p.m. (21:02 - 21:08)
cuz get that same place has had the (21:05 - 21:10)
elite raid and I knew if I got there (21:08 - 21:12)
five easy 20 people especially because (21:10 - 21:17)
it was a new legendary um but I ended up (21:12 - 21:19)
having like a work thing that ended up (21:17 - 21:22)
just going over right so I was like (21:19 - 21:23)
wanting to leave but I was in the middle (21:22 - 21:25)
of a meeting I couldn&#39;t just get up and (21:23 - 21:27)
leave so I ended up getting to that raid (21:25 - 21:30)
at like 5:45 so I was like well I&#39;m (21:27 - 21:31)
still going to go over there and just (21:30 - 21:34)
hope and there were still like three (21:31 - 21:36)
more lobbies of people that showed up in (21:34 - 21:39)
that time 15 minutes before it ended (21:36 - 21:42)
because again just location like it just (21:39 - 21:45)
happens to be a very popular area for (21:42 - 21:48)
playing Pokemon go wow and so if you (21:45 - 21:50)
have the location the time management (21:48 - 21:53)
isn&#39;t even be fair to give a little bit (21:50 - 21:56)
push back that is just Pok√©mon go in (21:53 - 21:59)
general like if it wasn&#39;t an elite raid (21:56 - 22:01)
it would be like a community day if it (21:59 - 22:04)
wasn&#39;t an elite raid it would be like (22:01 - 22:07)
some sort of event because Pokemon go (22:04 - 22:08)
revolves (22:07 - 22:11)
around being in the right place at the (22:08 - 22:14)
right time yeah like some Park like like (22:11 - 22:16)
you would think that Downtown (22:14 - 22:18)
Minneapolis would be a good place to (22:16 - 22:19)
play Pok√©mon go because there&#39;s like (22:18 - 22:21)
gold medal Park there&#39;s the Stone Arch (22:19 - 22:23)
Bridge across the bridge there like a (22:21 - 22:26)
bunch of restaurants and Pok√©mon go (22:23 - 22:28)
players just don&#39;t go there like every (22:26 - 22:30)
time I&#39;ve done there which is like three (22:28 - 22:31)
times like it&#39;s it&#39;s been nice cuz it&#39;s (22:30 - 22:33)
like a beautiful area it&#39;s like really (22:31 - 22:35)
great there&#39;s a bunch of restaurants but (22:33 - 22:36)
like the Pok√©mon go players don&#39;t go (22:35 - 22:39)
there so you don&#39;t see things like lured (22:36 - 22:41)
up when you jump into a gym like you (22:39 - 22:44)
don&#39;t see other people during those (22:41 - 22:45)
events okay but that&#39;s a there&#39;s a (22:44 - 22:47)
difference between making the experience (22:45 - 22:49)
a little bit better like if you have a (22:47 - 22:51)
community day and you&#39;re in an area (22:49 - 22:52)
that&#39;s not populated you can still play (22:51 - 22:54)
that Community Day it might not be (22:52 - 22:56)
lowered up it may not but if you have (22:54 - 22:57)
kind you can still play it you can still (22:56 - 22:59)
there&#39;s still going to be ever tried to (22:57 - 23:01)
play Community Day in a place where (22:59 - 23:03)
there aren&#39;t very many spawns yes I (23:01 - 23:05)
tried to play Community Day in a theater (23:03 - 23:06)
one time when my wife was having a (23:05 - 23:09)
concert uh a chorus concert and it did (23:06 - 23:11)
not work very well because I wasn&#39;t (23:09 - 23:14)
moving in the audience they (23:11 - 23:16)
were no I was not I don&#39;t mean sorry I (23:14 - 23:18)
don&#39;t mean I was in the theater playing (23:16 - 23:21)
I mean before walking in I was checking (23:18 - 23:23)
spawns after we walked out I was (23:21 - 23:24)
checking spawns I was present that (23:23 - 23:27)
entire concert I have two kids I had to (23:24 - 23:30)
make sure that they were not not popping (23:27 - 23:34)
off like during the concert anyways um (23:30 - 23:38)
but you can still play those you can&#39;t (23:34 - 23:41)
do in you can&#39;t do a mega Rayquaza raate (23:38 - 23:44)
alone like it&#39;s not possible it&#39;s (23:41 - 23:47)
impossible to beat a mega Rayquaza alone (23:44 - 23:49)
so like there&#39;s a difference between not (23:47 - 23:51)
being able to actually do the thing at (23:49 - 23:54)
all versus just having like a worse (23:51 - 23:56)
experience of that but still being able (23:54 - 24:00)
to do the event and that&#39;s yeah the main (23:56 - 24:01)
difference between something like a (24:00 - 24:05)
community day and an elite raid or or a (24:01 - 24:07)
raid raids in general or some or like um (24:05 - 24:08)
what&#39;s the other event where you spin (24:07 - 24:10)
the Pok√© stops and get the (24:08 - 24:12)
tasks research day research day yeah (24:10 - 24:16)
like research days yeah yeah yeah yeah (24:12 - 24:19)
um I I don&#39;t disagree but going back to (24:16 - 24:23)
like the time management stuff I don&#39;t (24:19 - 24:26)
know if people remember this I remember (24:23 - 24:28)
this very vividly and it&#39;s why I think (24:26 - 24:30)
like I like Elite raids so much or like (24:28 - 24:32)
ex raids whatever you want to call them (24:30 - 24:36)
is because back before Co you would like (24:32 - 24:39)
see you would you would either be using (24:36 - 24:41)
Discord or or Facebook and they would be (24:39 - 24:44)
like oh my god there uh West Dallas (24:41 - 24:47)
raids we&#39;re going to be doing uh (24:44 - 24:49)
gutina uh it&#39;s popping at this location (24:47 - 24:50)
at 4 (24:49 - 24:52)
o&#39; and then we&#39;re going to do like three (24:50 - 24:55)
more guas after so You&#39; like quickly get (24:52 - 24:59)
in your car you drive there you you you (24:55 - 25:00)
Park you&#39;re like oh my gosh I&#39;m going to (24:59 - 25:02)
be late I&#39;m going to be late like I (25:00 - 25:04)
traffic so bad you get there at like (25:02 - 25:07)
4:04 and you&#39;re like oh thank goodness (25:04 - 25:08)
they haven&#39;t started and you&#39;re like (25:07 - 25:10)
great and you&#39;re like ready to start and (25:08 - 25:13)
what happened every single time was (25:10 - 25:16)
somebody in the group would be like ah (25:13 - 25:18)
Janie is is only five minutes away can (25:16 - 25:20)
we just wait for Janie you&#39;re like yeah (25:18 - 25:22)
everyone&#39;s like yeah that&#39;s fine that&#39;s (25:20 - 25:25)
fine and then it&#39;s not five minutes it&#39;s (25:22 - 25:28)
like 10 minutes and then in that time (25:25 - 25:30)
some somebody else is like hey I got (25:28 - 25:32)
three more people on the way can we just (25:30 - 25:33)
wait till they get there and that is (25:32 - 25:37)
like what happened and so you would you (25:33 - 25:39)
would drive all the way to West Dallas (25:37 - 25:41)
which you don&#39;t want to be doing anyways (25:39 - 25:43)
and uh you would you would sit there for (25:41 - 25:47)
like 30 minutes to be fair you were also (25:43 - 25:50)
late you&#39;re right I was I was I I would (25:47 - 25:52)
argue this exact same thing happens with (25:50 - 25:55)
Elite raids I have had this experience (25:52 - 25:57)
with Elite raids yeah I&#39;ve never had (25:55 - 25:59)
this with Elite raid there is like an (25:57 - 26:02)
end yeah there is an end which means (25:59 - 26:05)
that it can&#39;t go on for as long but I (26:02 - 26:07)
when the reggi Eli Elite raids were (26:05 - 26:10)
going on I absolutely had this (26:07 - 26:13)
happen we had to wait for two people cuz (26:10 - 26:15)
a lot of people were in cars but some (26:13 - 26:17)
people were on bikes and so when we were (26:15 - 26:19)
going from one raid to another we had to (26:17 - 26:20)
wait and then they were saying more (26:19 - 26:22)
people would show up same thing this (26:20 - 26:25)
still happen it&#39;s not it&#39;s not gone it&#39;s (26:22 - 26:30)
it&#39;s not great it&#39;s just how this game (26:25 - 26:32)
works yeah I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a way (26:30 - 26:35)
to fix that part of (26:32 - 26:37)
it yeah I don&#39;t I (26:35 - 26:40)
don&#39;t think so either but I think the (26:37 - 26:44)
difference between that and now is (26:40 - 26:47)
campfire and I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m coming (26:44 - 26:50)
on the show and saying that campfire is (26:47 - 26:54)
good but it is it worked so well (26:50 - 26:56)
yesterday I&#39;m like blown away and I (26:54 - 26:59)
think (26:56 - 26:59)
I I I think when you see like the s road (27:01 - 27:08)
talking about how like Niantic doesn&#39;t (27:03 - 27:11)
cater to hardcore players or like who&#39;s (27:08 - 27:13)
using these features or like you see (27:11 - 27:16)
this on Twitter I I think you (27:13 - 27:19)
just don&#39;t I think those people are just (27:16 - 27:21)
wrong I think they&#39;re just not willing (27:19 - 27:24)
to admit that campfire is successful (27:21 - 27:26)
because the things that you see over and (27:24 - 27:27)
over and this is not the first time I&#39;ve (27:26 - 27:30)
used campfire obviously (27:27 - 27:32)
but I I (27:30 - 27:35)
think you see this (27:32 - 27:38)
like um discussion of like my local (27:35 - 27:42)
community is dead or like bring back $1 (27:38 - 27:45)
remote raids like I no no one&#39;s going (27:42 - 27:48)
out and raiding it&#39;s just not true like (27:45 - 27:50)
I logged into campfire right at (27:48 - 27:55)
4:00 and I went I like moved the map up (27:50 - 27:58)
to um Centennial Lakes which is where I (27:55 - 28:01)
normally play and there was no Elite (27:58 - 28:03)
raids and I was like oh that&#39;s weird and (28:01 - 28:05)
I you might be saying like Steve why (28:03 - 28:07)
don&#39;t you go to mall America M America (28:05 - 28:08)
doesn&#39;t have Elite raids I don&#39;t know (28:07 - 28:10)
why even though like two of those gyms (28:08 - 28:13)
are ex gyms they like still say ex gyms (28:10 - 28:15)
they just don&#39;t turn into Elite raids (28:13 - 28:17)
they never have out of how many Elite (28:15 - 28:19)
raids have we had so far like like quite (28:17 - 28:21)
a bit like six or seven six or seven I (28:19 - 28:24)
think yeah and so I was I when I opened (28:21 - 28:27)
the app I got a little notification from (28:24 - 28:30)
like a community commity Ambassador cuz (28:27 - 28:31)
I guess I joined something and it said (28:30 - 28:33)
we&#39;re doing Elite raids at (28:31 - 28:37)
5:00 and so I was like well there&#39;s none (28:33 - 28:40)
at uh Centennial Lakes so I guess I&#39;ll (28:37 - 28:41)
just look at this notification and they (28:40 - 28:44)
were like we&#39;re starting here it showed (28:41 - 28:45)
on the map and they&#39;re like we&#39;re going (28:44 - 28:46)
to walk this way and there were there (28:45 - 28:49)
were five Elite raids in like a little (28:46 - 28:51)
walking path that I could see and they (28:49 - 28:55)
all said they popped at 5501 p.m. and (28:51 - 28:56)
then it said like when you get here make (28:55 - 28:58)
sure to check in and you&#39;ll get a reward (28:56 - 29:00)
and I was like dang that&#39;s so cool and (28:58 - 29:04)
then it showed that like 118 people (29:00 - 29:07)
rsvpd and I don&#39;t think Lake (29:04 - 29:11)
nomus uh is a very good place to play (29:07 - 29:14)
because it&#39;s a giant Lake and once you (29:11 - 29:17)
start your walk around it you have to (29:14 - 29:19)
either commit or backtrack like that&#39;s (29:17 - 29:23)
it like um and like there are a lot of (29:19 - 29:25)
gyms around it it takes about 45 if (29:23 - 29:26)
you&#39;re (29:25 - 29:28)
walking if it&#39;s if you&#39;re walking the (29:26 - 29:30)
speed of pride month takes you about 45 (29:28 - 29:32)
minutes maybe like a normal person takes (29:30 - 29:36)
like an hour or so but wait w on what (29:32 - 29:38)
the don&#39;t worry about it don&#39;t worry (29:36 - 29:41)
about it (29:38 - 29:41)
Bobby so like I never do Community Day (29:42 - 29:48)
at Lake nomus but like I I know people (29:45 - 29:50)
play there so I was like I don&#39;t think I (29:48 - 29:53)
can make the 5:00 so I just like move (29:50 - 29:55)
the map over and I see that there&#39;s (29:53 - 29:58)
another Park super tiny like right ex (29:55 - 30:01)
Lake nomus and it says it has three ex (29:58 - 30:03)
raids at 6:00 and I&#39;m I was like I&#39;ve (30:01 - 30:05)
never been to this area I&#39;ve never been (30:03 - 30:07)
to this park is this map even right and (30:05 - 30:09)
there was also a little Community (30:07 - 30:11)
Ambassador thing that said (30:09 - 30:13)
like if you check in you&#39;ll get a reward (30:11 - 30:16)
and so I clicked on it and it said 79 (30:13 - 30:18)
people rsvpd and I was like that&#39;s crazy (30:16 - 30:21)
because the people from nomus can&#39;t get (30:18 - 30:24)
to this other Park fast enough um (30:21 - 30:26)
especially if they&#39;re doing like a ray (30:24 - 30:28)
train so I was like okay I&#39;m just going (30:26 - 30:31)
to to 6:00 I&#39;m going to trust that three (30:28 - 30:32)
Elite raids are going to pop if only one (30:31 - 30:35)
pops that&#39;s fine I just I I just want to (30:32 - 30:37)
do a ray quaz it&#39;s gorgeous out (30:35 - 30:40)
yesterday Niantic was like oh Steve good (30:37 - 30:42)
WEA we&#39;re gonna we need a w here good (30:40 - 30:48)
weather uh campfire is working so (30:42 - 30:48)
uh so I I so I head over there and I&#39;m (30:50 - 30:57)
I&#39;m driving there and I have to drive (30:56 - 31:01)
past Omas to get to this other (30:57 - 31:04)
Park and while I&#39;m driving there&#39;s just (31:01 - 31:09)
this huge line of people like 60 people (31:04 - 31:11)
and they&#39;re walking towards the next (31:09 - 31:12)
Elite raid and I&#39;m like sitting in (31:11 - 31:15)
traffic and I&#39;m thinking do I hand my (31:12 - 31:17)
phone over to my passenger and be like (31:15 - 31:18)
hey let&#39;s jump with this raid we&#39;re (31:17 - 31:19)
stuck in traffic and I was like no it&#39;s (31:18 - 31:22)
fine because it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s like 5:45 so (31:19 - 31:24)
this it&#39;s like the raids have like five (31:22 - 31:26)
minutes left or whatever (31:24 - 31:28)
mhm and I was like no no know we&#39;re like (31:26 - 31:30)
we&#39;re we&#39;re like 8 minutes away we&#39;ll be (31:28 - 31:32)
there like 10 minutes early it&#39;s fine (31:30 - 31:34)
and then as I&#39;m driving around Lake (31:32 - 31:37)
nomus I just see huge groups of people (31:34 - 31:39)
at what would be gyms and they&#39;re like (31:37 - 31:41)
doing raids and I was like this is (31:39 - 31:43)
there&#39;s so many people out right now and (31:41 - 31:45)
then I get to the park I don&#39;t even know (31:43 - 31:46)
what this park is called I get to the (31:45 - 31:48)
park for there were there were three (31:46 - 31:51)
Elite raids like five minute timers left (31:48 - 31:55)
gorgeous Park as well like they just a (31:51 - 31:57)
fantastic they had a rock climbing wall (31:55 - 31:59)
at this park (31:57 - 32:01)
I was like what is (31:59 - 32:04)
happening you could climb a rock wall (32:01 - 32:07)
probably installed by Niantic and once (32:04 - 32:09)
again there was like a little check-in (32:07 - 32:10)
thing so I checked in it gave me a free (32:09 - 32:13)
raid pass I was like oh that&#39;s cool just (32:10 - 32:17)
by doing that and the raids popped and (32:13 - 32:19)
all the you could stand in the middle (32:17 - 32:20)
and touch all three which is great I (32:19 - 32:23)
didn&#39;t talk to anyone did all three (32:20 - 32:25)
which was also great the community (32:23 - 32:27)
Ambassador guy like right before the (32:25 - 32:29)
raid started he was like we&#39;re doing a (32:27 - 32:31)
group picture come over here and I was (32:29 - 32:33)
like uh not for me man but that&#39;s like (32:31 - 32:36)
cool you&#39;re doing a group picture but (32:33 - 32:37)
while I was in the first raid I started (32:36 - 32:40)
counting people and I counted over a (32:37 - 32:43)
hundred adults and that was no kid there (32:40 - 32:45)
were there were plenty of iPad kids (32:43 - 32:48)
running up and down slides like doing (32:45 - 32:50)
jumps off rocks being like I got a (32:48 - 32:52)
Rayquaza I got there was one kid on top (32:50 - 32:54)
of the rock wall being like (32:52 - 32:57)
shiny with his like holding up his like (32:54 - 33:02)
iPad yes best that&#39;s amazing I just (32:57 - 33:05)
think that this like perception of my (33:02 - 33:08)
local community is dead is (33:05 - 33:11)
just wrong I think it&#39;s just people not (33:08 - 33:14)
accepting that campfire is (33:11 - 33:18)
working and the other thing I&#39;ll say is (33:14 - 33:21)
I took note because I did three raids in (33:18 - 33:25)
all of these raids 15 out of 20 people (33:21 - 33:28)
were under level 40 mhm there a lot of (33:25 - 33:33)
34s a lot of 36s like 38 I only saw one (33:28 - 33:35)
other level 50 in the three raids I did (33:33 - 33:37)
now again there was over 100 people so (33:35 - 33:38)
maybe the level 50 is coordinated or (33:37 - 33:42)
something I doubt it but (33:38 - 33:45)
like I think campfire is great I don&#39;t I (33:42 - 33:47)
don&#39;t think this is like me defending (33:45 - 33:50)
Elite raids but it was so easy for me to (33:47 - 33:53)
open up campfire scroll around the map (33:50 - 33:56)
see this is at five this is at six this (33:53 - 34:00)
one was at three go there and no people (33:56 - 34:02)
were going to show up cuz it said 79 (34:00 - 34:04)
people RSVP and when I got there there (34:02 - 34:06)
was more than including kids there were (34:04 - 34:08)
more than 150 people at this park that (34:06 - 34:11)
I&#39;ve never seen like never heard (34:08 - 34:14)
of like you wouldn&#39;t play Community Day (34:11 - 34:15)
there there was three gyms and four Pok√© (34:14 - 34:17)
stops it&#39;s not like a community day park (34:15 - 34:19)
but it was still like a a really (34:17 - 34:20)
gorgeous Park and then there was like a (34:19 - 34:23)
showcase (34:20 - 34:23)
there the average person I think were (34:24 - 34:29)
was that like I like I think there&#39;s (34:27 - 34:32)
this perception on the sil Road or on (34:29 - 34:34)
Twitter that the like the the average (34:32 - 34:37)
Pokemon go player is level 48 and (34:34 - 34:39)
they&#39;re they&#39;re doing they&#39;re doing (34:37 - 34:40)
three remote raids a day and they would (34:39 - 34:42)
be doing more if there was not a cap (34:40 - 34:45)
like that that is the minority of (34:42 - 34:48)
players that is always how that goes (34:45 - 34:51)
though those bubbles the Twitter uh (34:48 - 34:53)
threads the bubbles of people who are (34:51 - 34:56)
like on there to primarily to talk (34:53 - 34:58)
Pokemon (34:56 - 35:00)
end up thinking that like yeah most of (34:58 - 35:01)
the people who play the game or whatever (35:00 - 35:03)
are like us and then it turns out no (35:01 - 35:04)
there&#39;s a lot of people who don&#39;t like (35:03 - 35:06)
use social media just play the game (35:04 - 35:08)
casually or whatever that aren&#39;t like (35:06 - 35:10)
that because even in this area that I (35:08 - 35:13)
was talking about that is very populated (35:10 - 35:17)
or very popular for Pokemon go playing (35:13 - 35:18)
when I was in that Elite raid yesterday (35:17 - 35:19)
yeah there were a lot of people under (35:18 - 35:22)
level 40 in the that were in the lobby (35:19 - 35:24)
um there were you know and the other (35:22 - 35:26)
times I&#39;ve done Elite raids at that same (35:24 - 35:27)
gym there are still a lot of people (35:26 - 35:29)
under level 40 and (35:27 - 35:33)
so you know I understand that as well um (35:29 - 35:35)
I I I have a different opinion on Elite (35:33 - 35:37)
raids than you do I like I don&#39;t know (35:35 - 35:38)
and campfire as well I don&#39;t even have (35:37 - 35:40)
the campfire app (35:38 - 35:44)
downloaded well I was gonna say Steve I (35:40 - 35:46)
think this was a particularly good (35:44 - 35:48)
campfire experience I don&#39;t know if (35:46 - 35:51)
that&#39;s the average campfire (35:48 - 35:54)
experience um I think I do think it&#39;s (35:51 - 35:56)
gotten better I think that their (35:54 - 35:59)
investment in community leaders has (35:56 - 36:03)
helped a lot but also I don&#39;t live close (35:59 - 36:05)
enough to one of those to have that (36:03 - 36:08)
opportunity there&#39;s not one there&#39;s not (36:05 - 36:11)
a community Ambassador in my (36:08 - 36:13)
city and so that&#39;s there&#39;s multiple (36:11 - 36:14)
Community ambassadors in my city there&#39;s (36:13 - 36:16)
one at mall America there&#39;s one at Nomas (36:14 - 36:18)
there&#39;s one at whatever Park I went to (36:16 - 36:20)
there&#39;s there&#39;s more obviously it&#39;s I (36:18 - 36:21)
haven&#39;t experienced that sounds like an (36:20 - 36:25)
opportunity Hannah it does it here yep (36:21 - 36:28)
here&#39;s here&#39;s a hot take cuz cu the (36:25 - 36:30)
listeners knowing that I&#39;ve I&#39;ve worked (36:28 - 36:32)
with Niantic I&#39;ve been in meetings with (36:30 - 36:35)
Niantic Niantic has paid for me to go to (36:32 - 36:37)
like Korea they paid for me to go to (36:35 - 36:41)
like Seattle go Fest right (36:37 - 36:46)
um I think Niantic shift shifting from (36:41 - 36:49)
content creators to finding Community (36:46 - 36:52)
ambassadors was the correct play and I&#39;m (36:49 - 36:55)
sure other content creators like hate (36:52 - 36:58)
this or like would hate to hear this but (36:55 - 37:01)
they know they know that like like the (36:58 - 37:03)
person the Kestrel the person who was in (37:01 - 37:05)
charge of the content creators got (37:03 - 37:08)
moved whether they wanted to or not I I (37:05 - 37:10)
think they did want to to be in charge (37:08 - 37:13)
of community ambassadors and I think (37:10 - 37:16)
Niantic building up Community Ambassador (37:13 - 37:19)
programs to then have the experience (37:16 - 37:22)
that I had yesterday was the correct (37:19 - 37:25)
play because honestly there&#39;s nothing in (37:22 - 37:28)
it for Content creators there like it I (37:25 - 37:30)
we&#39;ll get to this after the break but I (37:28 - 37:33)
I ran a TCG League at one point and it (37:30 - 37:36)
was a nightmare it was so much work for (37:33 - 37:40)
what it was worth and I I would assume (37:36 - 37:42)
the same for for Community ambassadors (37:40 - 37:44)
like they have to organize they have to (37:42 - 37:47)
make sure everyone&#39;s playing like some (37:44 - 37:49)
like somebody had to then like set up (37:47 - 37:52)
the RSVP like get the like communicate (37:49 - 37:54)
with everyone make sure everyone (37:52 - 37:56)
understands and be be on time like a lot (37:54 - 37:58)
of content creators just don&#39;t have that (37:56 - 38:01)
time to do that kind of stuff nor do (37:58 - 38:04)
they have the like this is like an (38:01 - 38:07)
ambassador&#39;s you know job more or less (38:04 - 38:09)
right a content (38:07 - 38:11)
creator if people don&#39;t show up or (38:09 - 38:13)
whatever they don&#39;t they&#39;re not like (38:11 - 38:15)
okay focused on other things move on (38:13 - 38:17)
they&#39;re focused on their focus is not (38:15 - 38:18)
the same thing as one of these like (38:17 - 38:21)
Community ambassadors even if they are (38:18 - 38:24)
sort of an ambassador for the community (38:21 - 38:27)
in a way but it&#39;s a little it&#39;s (38:24 - 38:29)
different in that that their focus isn&#39;t (38:27 - 38:32)
solely on that where this is more the (38:29 - 38:35)
the job at hand yeah I mean back before (38:32 - 38:36)
the community ambassador program was a (38:35 - 38:39)
thing uh back when I was in college I (38:36 - 38:41)
ran a Pok√©mon go club for three out of (38:39 - 38:44)
my four years of college it was great it (38:41 - 38:45)
had current students alumni faculty and (38:44 - 38:47)
staff and I still love saying that (38:45 - 38:49)
because Pokemon go brought so many (38:47 - 38:51)
different people together and having a (38:49 - 38:54)
community like that has always been one (38:51 - 38:56)
of the most enjoyable parts of this game (38:54 - 38:58)
to me so I am not surprised at all that (38:56 - 39:01)
the community ambassador program is (38:58 - 39:03)
bringing people together in this way (39:01 - 39:06)
that is really feeling good and seeming (39:03 - 39:10)
successful but also it is a ton of work (39:06 - 39:12)
not only to run a community but to also (39:10 - 39:14)
just get to the point of being a (39:12 - 39:16)
community Ambassador there&#39;s someone in (39:14 - 39:18)
our slack who worked on it for I think (39:16 - 39:21)
over a year to become a community (39:18 - 39:23)
Ambassador it takes a long time to get (39:21 - 39:25)
that up and going and so these people (39:23 - 39:29)
have put a lot of work into this (39:25 - 39:30)
and and just continue to because it (39:29 - 39:33)
feels so good to to be in communities (39:30 - 39:35)
like that I don&#39;t know so yeah I&#39;m not (39:33 - 39:37)
surprised this is working and I&#39;m happy (39:35 - 39:40)
it is I just wish there were more I (39:37 - 39:43)
guess yeah well it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s a bummer (39:40 - 39:44)
there&#39;s not one in your city I I will (39:43 - 39:48)
say like I when uh we were doing it was (39:44 - 39:52)
c tour I was out with um my son we were (39:48 - 39:54)
just like taking pictures of Pokemon and (39:52 - 39:55)
stuff and like we we were doing some (39:54 - 39:59)
raids in one of the um areas uh maybe (39:55 - 40:01)
like 10 15 minutes 15 minute drive from (39:59 - 40:04)
my house and we&#39;re taking pictures and (40:01 - 40:06)
stuff and I turn around and like Steve (40:04 - 40:08)
was saying there&#39;s just this giant line (40:06 - 40:11)
of people and they&#39;re all walking the (40:08 - 40:13)
same direction and then I look at the (40:11 - 40:14)
app and I noticed like oh well there are (40:13 - 40:17)
like four or five gyms along this and (40:14 - 40:18)
there was the origin Dialga raids and (40:17 - 40:22)
the origin Pia raids and then I saw a (40:18 - 40:24)
lead person who was kind of doing all (40:22 - 40:26)
the leading and kind of yelling out like (40:24 - 40:28)
hey stop we&#39;re going to do this one now (40:26 - 40:30)
we&#39;re going to do the it had to have (40:28 - 40:31)
been like you were saying there had to (40:30 - 40:34)
have been like 80 or 100 people and they (40:31 - 40:35)
were just all in line and then that&#39;s (40:34 - 40:37)
when I realized you know pretty quickly (40:35 - 40:39)
I was like oh this must be like one of (40:37 - 40:41)
the community ambassadors and then I (40:39 - 40:43)
looked on the app and everything and it (40:41 - 40:44)
was like oh you can check in and and all (40:43 - 40:47)
this stuff yeah but it was it was (40:44 - 40:49)
awesome to see that because I hadn&#39;t (40:47 - 40:52)
seen that in a long time I hadn&#39;t seen (40:49 - 40:55)
that level of that amount of people (40:52 - 40:57)
together other than when we were all (40:55 - 41:00)
hanging out for in tour week before LA (40:57 - 41:03)
but like uh at just like a it was like a (41:00 - 41:04)
global event but it just seeing that (41:03 - 41:06)
many people all doing raids together and (41:04 - 41:08)
stuff I hadn&#39;t seen that since before (41:06 - 41:11)
the pandemic started and so we kind of (41:08 - 41:13)
joined up we did a couple raids with PE (41:11 - 41:14)
with you know the groups that were there (41:13 - 41:17)
doing that because we were also doing (41:14 - 41:20)
raids and it was just fun to be in the (41:17 - 41:22)
atmosphere of like all the people (41:20 - 41:24)
playing together all the people like (41:22 - 41:26)
talking Pokemon and talk you know having (41:24 - 41:28)
their different conversations and things (41:26 - 41:31)
like that uh was a fun experience so I (41:28 - 41:33)
think that was I agree that it was (41:31 - 41:34)
definitely a right move like I think the (41:33 - 41:37)
community ambassadors are huge uh (41:34 - 41:40)
because there are so many people that (41:37 - 41:42)
play the game that are (41:40 - 41:46)
not on Twitter or know or watching (41:42 - 41:47)
YouTube and know who these content (41:46 - 41:49)
creators are or doing these things but (41:47 - 41:52)
when you have a way to connect with the (41:49 - 41:55)
community even if it&#39;s not like directly (41:52 - 41:58)
through the Pokemon Go app which there (41:55 - 41:59)
that&#39;s a whole different conversation (41:58 - 42:02)
but at least they do have that campfire (41:59 - 42:04)
at least they do have an app that does (42:02 - 42:05)
allow people to connect with the (42:04 - 42:07)
community because for a long time they (42:05 - 42:09)
didn&#39;t right there was you had to go to (42:07 - 42:11)
Discord you had to go to Facebook you (42:09 - 42:14)
had to go to you know slack um and and (42:11 - 42:18)
we made that work in a lot of ways but (42:14 - 42:20)
having Niantic actually have control of (42:18 - 42:22)
that in in ways and and hire you know (42:20 - 42:26)
getting people that that are for that is (42:22 - 42:28)
I think I&#39;m not I would word it as (42:26 - 42:30)
having Niantic having control of it is a (42:28 - 42:32)
good thing but I will say that having (42:30 - 42:35)
one place that they can just say go here (42:32 - 42:36)
and you can (42:35 - 42:38)
organize it&#39;s helpful I mean not saying (42:36 - 42:40)
n but like Niantic is the one create (42:38 - 42:42)
getting these Community ambassadors out (42:40 - 42:43)
there they&#39;re the ones that are like (42:42 - 42:44)
saying hey there&#39;s this community (42:43 - 42:47)
ambassador program let&#39;s focus in on (42:44 - 42:49)
that so that people are out there I mean (42:47 - 42:51)
those Community ambassadors are then (42:49 - 42:53)
kind of controlling that situ you know (42:51 - 42:55)
that area and that situation that&#39;s (42:53 - 42:58)
great but I just mean to have an app (42:55 - 43:02)
that is the company put together to (42:58 - 43:05)
actually have you join communities in (43:02 - 43:08)
the game that the company makes I think (43:05 - 43:11)
is a move that people wanted for a long (43:08 - 43:13)
time and yeah even though I don&#39;t have (43:11 - 43:14)
the app downloaded right now and to be (43:13 - 43:17)
clear if you live in okan okonak (43:14 - 43:21)
Wisconsin with all with just Aver&#39;s and (43:17 - 43:24)
and that&#39;s it yes your Pokemon go (43:21 - 43:26)
experience is not going to be any (43:24 - 43:28)
better like I understand that but it (43:26 - 43:30)
could possibly be a little bit better (43:28 - 43:32)
now that you may know that other people (43:30 - 43:34)
are also playing the game I mean it just (43:32 - 43:36)
goes back to like you don&#39;t have to you (43:34 - 43:38)
might not have to use a third party app (43:36 - 43:40)
like Discord or something like that when (43:38 - 43:42)
the if if all you do is play Pokemon go (43:40 - 43:45)
or you know if when it comes to that if (43:42 - 43:46)
you just play Pokemon go but you don&#39;t (43:45 - 43:49)
know Discord or you don&#39;t know slack or (43:46 - 43:51)
these third party apps to you know get (43:49 - 43:54)
together it&#39;s good to have a way to (43:51 - 43:56)
connect with the community if that&#39;s (43:54 - 43:58)
just all you&#39;re doing with that you know (43:56 - 44:00)
and there hasn&#39;t been that for years and (43:58 - 44:02)
now there is and it could make those (44:00 - 44:04)
experiences better you may not know not (44:02 - 44:05)
have known that there was even three or (44:04 - 44:07)
four other people who play the game and (44:05 - 44:09)
I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m defending campfire (44:07 - 44:11)
now when I just talked about you don&#39;t (44:09 - 44:12)
installed sounds like you need to (44:11 - 44:15)
reinstall it I have to reinstall it I (44:12 - 44:17)
guess now that I defending Co like (44:15 - 44:19)
Niantic didn&#39;t kill like local (44:17 - 44:22)
communities right like Co did like (44:19 - 44:23)
people didn&#39;t want to go people didn&#39;t (44:22 - 44:25)
want to go back outside people either (44:23 - 44:27)
stopped playing the game people got used (44:25 - 44:30)
to just spending dollar after dollar (44:27 - 44:33)
after dollar to remote into raids and (44:30 - 44:38)
then they didn&#39;t like that the price was (44:33 - 44:42)
raised and then the limit was (44:38 - 44:45)
on but like there&#39;s a huge difference (44:42 - 44:48)
between campfire and Discord or Facebook (44:45 - 44:50)
Messenger which was like a lot a lot of (44:48 - 44:51)
things because (44:50 - 44:54)
like that is just like a text based (44:51 - 44:55)
communication right like we&#39;re going to (44:54 - 44:58)
be doing raids here mhm (44:55 - 45:00)
or (44:58 - 45:03)
uh show up at this time whereas like I (45:00 - 45:05)
didn&#39;t have to talk to anyone on (45:03 - 45:07)
campfire I didn&#39;t have to coordinate (45:05 - 45:11)
anything I opened up a map and I (45:07 - 45:13)
scrolled and you could just like there&#39;s (45:11 - 45:15)
like tags you can just search for raids (45:13 - 45:16)
you can just search for Pok√© stops you (45:15 - 45:18)
can just search for like meet I think (45:16 - 45:20)
it&#39;s called meetups which is like what (45:18 - 45:22)
the community ambassadors do M so I just (45:20 - 45:24)
turned on the Meetup thing and I saw (45:22 - 45:26)
like seven of them and then I clicked on (45:24 - 45:27)
the lake nomus one and that one said (45:26 - 45:29)
started at 5: and then the one like (45:27 - 45:30)
right next to it said it started at 6 (45:29 - 45:31)
and I was like perfect that&#39;s how I (45:30 - 45:34)
figured it out and I saw that 70 some (45:31 - 45:36)
people were going to it and I saw it (45:34 - 45:38)
started at 6 and then I turned back on (45:36 - 45:40)
raids and I saw there were three raids (45:38 - 45:43)
like it was to say (45:40 - 45:45)
like my community is dead my local (45:43 - 45:49)
community is dead I&#39;m on Discord I (45:45 - 45:51)
believe it 100% believe it I don&#39;t think (45:49 - 45:54)
you&#39;re lying but (45:51 - 45:54)
like and maybe maybe in campire it also (45:55 - 46:00)
like no one is doing it cuz it (45:58 - 46:03)
completely gave up but but I don&#39;t think (46:00 - 46:07)
like Pokemon to see 150 people at this (46:03 - 46:10)
very small park that is like not like a (46:07 - 46:13)
huge Park not like a Mall of America was (46:10 - 46:14)
just (46:13 - 46:18)
like kind of crazy to like you you have (46:14 - 46:21)
to like it it&#39;s not like sitting at home (46:18 - 46:23)
like signing into like Destiny because (46:21 - 46:25)
like that&#39;s easy you have to like (46:23 - 46:28)
actively go out and do that&#39;s a lot for (46:25 - 46:30)
a game to be like okay at 6:00 I&#39;m going (46:28 - 46:32)
to pack up the kids we&#39;re going to (46:30 - 46:33)
charge the iPads we&#39;re going to go out (46:32 - 46:35)
we&#39;re going to spend 30 minutes like (46:33 - 46:39)
that is a big ask for a player in a game (46:35 - 46:41)
versus like I&#39;m just going to sit on my (46:39 - 46:42)
couch and turn something on which (46:41 - 46:43)
there&#39;s nothing wrong with that to be (46:42 - 46:47)
fair it&#39;s just the barrier to entry is (46:43 - 46:48)
so much (46:47 - 46:51)
lower yeah out of curiosity you say you (46:48 - 46:53)
open the app and you didn&#39;t have to do (46:51 - 46:55)
anything you just knew it was going on (46:53 - 46:56)
were you one of those people who marked (46:55 - 46:59)
yourself as going to this yeah I hit the (46:56 - 47:02)
little RS I hit the RSVP on (46:59 - 47:05)
both um cuz I wasn&#39;t sure what it (47:02 - 47:08)
did uh okay well I also wonder how many (47:05 - 47:12)
people like how when I saw that the the (47:08 - 47:15)
six o&#39; had like 70 some people RSVP I (47:12 - 47:18)
expected like 30 like I was like worst (47:15 - 47:21)
like best case scenario 30 of these 60 (47:18 - 47:23)
people show up sure and that&#39;s why I (47:21 - 47:26)
counted cuz I was like oh there&#39;s way (47:23 - 47:29)
more than 70 people here mhm there&#39;s (47:26 - 47:32)
like 70 kids here there&#39;s a lot of iPads (47:29 - 47:35)
running around this park right now (47:32 - 47:35)
mhm yeah that&#39;s and yeah and to your (47:36 - 47:42)
point I mean one person checking in (47:39 - 47:44)
doesn&#39;t mean only one person is showing (47:42 - 47:46)
up right like to like if there are kids (47:44 - 47:47)
good chance that the kids maybe aren&#39;t (47:46 - 47:49)
on the campfire app so like that parent (47:47 - 47:51)
is like oh I&#39;m checking in and I have a (47:49 - 47:54)
kid with me or you know and so that 79 (47:51 - 47:58)
easily turns into 120 130 uh depending (47:54 - 47:59)
on like how many people are in that (47:58 - 48:02)
party and who&#39;s actually using campfire (47:59 - 48:05)
and who&#39;s not right so I mean still (48:02 - 48:07)
still shows that like some people can be (48:05 - 48:08)
showing up and they&#39;re not using the (48:07 - 48:12)
app I I would just encourage people that (48:08 - 48:14)
are like I don&#39;t have a community it&#39;s (48:12 - 48:16)
like my first question would be like did (48:14 - 48:18)
you check (48:16 - 48:20)
campfire and if they did and they don&#39;t (48:18 - 48:23)
have a community I would be like yeah (48:20 - 48:25)
that sucks like it does but (48:23 - 48:29)
like there genuinely I do still want (48:25 - 48:31)
this game to support online communities (48:29 - 48:33)
a bit more and I do think there are ways (48:31 - 48:37)
that they could do that without uh while (48:33 - 48:39)
still encouraging people to go outside I (48:37 - 48:41)
do think online communities are (48:39 - 48:43)
important but the in-person communities (48:41 - 48:46)
are also important and because that&#39;s (48:43 - 48:48)
what&#39;s being supported right now that&#39;s (48:46 - 48:50)
probably where you should (48:48 - 48:53)
check because again I I I I (48:50 - 48:55)
wholeheartedly believe that your Discord (48:53 - 48:57)
Community has died since Co like I I do (48:55 - 49:01)
believe that um but if I was to go to a (48:57 - 49:02)
new (49:01 - 49:06)
city and it was like a community day I (49:02 - 49:08)
would I I my best judgment would be to (49:06 - 49:10)
open up like if I if I was in Japan for (49:08 - 49:13)
Community Day first off I bet it would (49:10 - 49:17)
be popping but like which park is the (49:13 - 49:18)
better park right like I don&#39;t I don&#39;t (49:17 - 49:21)
know so I would and I&#39;d also don&#39;t speak (49:18 - 49:24)
Japanese so I like I am I supposed to go (49:21 - 49:26)
to like a Japanese Discord to figure (49:24 - 49:27)
that out like my best bet would would be (49:26 - 49:29)
campfire and then turn on like which (49:27 - 49:31)
parks are Community Ambassador parks and (49:29 - 49:33)
then I could also just see how many gyms (49:31 - 49:35)
are there how many pok√© stops are there (49:33 - 49:37)
like you can do like I know that there&#39;s (49:35 - 49:38)
a bunch of people listening to this (49:37 - 49:40)
podcast and I know there&#39;s a bunch of (49:38 - 49:41)
people who play Pokemon go that are (49:40 - 49:44)
introverted like myself included I went (49:41 - 49:45)
to that Park I didn&#39;t talk to anyone (49:44 - 49:48)
except the my partner who came with me (49:45 - 49:50)
like I didn&#39;t uh I I didn&#39;t want to talk (49:48 - 49:51)
to anyone but that doesn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t (49:50 - 49:53)
have a good time like it was so cool to (49:51 - 49:55)
see all these people have a good time (49:53 - 49:57)
and like people stick around and like (49:55 - 50:00)
kind of hang out in the park and I saw (49:57 - 50:02)
people trading and stuff but like that (50:00 - 50:04)
whole experience I had didn&#39;t have to (50:02 - 50:06)
talk to a single I didn&#39;t have to like (50:04 - 50:08)
type in a Facebook chat or to like type (50:06 - 50:10)
in a Discord to be like are we still (50:08 - 50:13)
doing this uh count me in like I&#39;m I&#39;m (50:10 - 50:15)
also coming with a plus one like I (50:13 - 50:17)
remember doing that because I did that (50:15 - 50:19)
back I did that for Reggie Drago I was (50:17 - 50:21)
like hey I&#39;m coming at 10 o&#39;clock with a (50:19 - 50:22)
plus one and then somebody be like all (50:21 - 50:24)
right we&#39;re up to 12 like I didn&#39;t have (50:22 - 50:26)
to do any communication I&#39;m as in (50:24 - 50:29)
introvert as they come H and it was a (50:26 - 50:32)
real great experience and again if you (50:29 - 50:34)
live in the middle of nowhere this (50:32 - 50:36)
doesn&#39;t apply to you but also or if you (50:34 - 50:38)
just live somewhere that doesn&#39;t have (50:36 - 50:41)
Community ambassadors I live in a city (50:38 - 50:44)
yeah you can still you can it can still (50:41 - 50:47)
be an improvement like not knowing who (50:44 - 50:50)
plays Pok√©mon go in your community to (50:47 - 50:51)
downloading an app that potentially (50:50 - 50:53)
tells you that even one other person (50:51 - 50:55)
plays Pok√©mon go in your community can (50:53 - 50:58)
be beneficial living in a small town (50:55 - 51:01)
does not mean that like I said it can be (50:58 - 51:04)
beneficial it will be beneficial I&#39;m not (51:01 - 51:05)
I will I I said this like six months ago (51:04 - 51:08)
I will say it again Pokemon go is no (51:05 - 51:10)
different than a dating app you live in (51:08 - 51:12)
the you live in okon Wisconsin you (51:10 - 51:14)
probably have like the same three white (51:12 - 51:16)
guys holding a fish and you&#39;re not (51:14 - 51:18)
you&#39;re not getting anyone else you got (51:16 - 51:20)
you got to move you go to the city there (51:18 - 51:23)
are more date there are more options to (51:20 - 51:25)
date there are also more Pokemon go (51:23 - 51:27)
players you just (51:25 - 51:31)
I&#39;m sorry okok you kind of suck this is (51:27 - 51:34)
salt on Pizza all over (51:31 - 51:36)
again (51:34 - 51:39)
wow this this town that I can&#39;t even (51:36 - 51:41)
pronounce you really got a problem with (51:39 - 51:44)
this town Steve it&#39;s like it&#39;s like 40 (51:41 - 51:45)
minutes away from (51:44 - 51:47)
Milwaukee I had a job that was very (51:45 - 51:48)
close to (51:47 - 51:51)
Aon I see and the only thing there was a (51:48 - 51:55)
Culver that was it yeah you you big on (51:51 - 51:57)
this Culver that apparently is that&#39;s (51:55 - 51:59)
all that was (51:57 - 52:04)
there I we need to take a (51:59 - 52:08)
break yeah we&#39;ll be right back and we (52:04 - 52:11)
are back from our (52:08 - 52:15)
break AI let&#39;s talk about it (52:11 - 52:18)
again (52:15 - 52:18)
yay I closed my Google doc so the (52:18 - 52:26)
Pokemon company actually said something (52:22 - 52:31)
regarding the stuff um and it was the (52:26 - 52:34)
best thing they could have said I think (52:31 - 52:37)
in my opinion uh here I have I have the (52:34 - 52:40)
Tweet they tweeted it unfortunately this (52:37 - 52:42)
is why I still have Twitter because I (52:40 - 52:43)
don&#39;t know how else I would have seen (52:42 - 52:45)
this (52:43 - 52:47)
yep because I don&#39;t think they put it on (52:45 - 52:49)
their website I I can tell you I saw it (52:47 - 52:51)
I saw it on threads someone (52:49 - 52:54)
screenshotted the Tweet oh okay perfect (52:51 - 52:58)
so there you go great (52:54 - 52:58)
uh this is from the Pokemon TCG account (52:59 - 53:03)
they actually posted this at 9:40 p.m. (53:01 - 53:05)
on June 24th which is kind of a weird (53:03 - 53:07)
posting time I guess yeah weird time of (53:05 - 53:09)
it&#39;s like you post on that time when you (53:07 - 53:10)
don&#39;t want people to see what you&#39;re (53:09 - 53:13)
doing yeah they said we are aware that (53:10 - 53:15)
select entrance from the top 300 (53:13 - 53:17)
finalists of the Pokemon TCG (53:15 - 53:19)
illustration contest (53:17 - 53:22)
2024 have violated the official contest (53:19 - 53:24)
rules as a result the entrance in (53:22 - 53:26)
violation of the rules have been (53:24 - 53:27)
disqualified from the (53:26 - 53:30)
contest perfect great that&#39;s what we (53:27 - 53:33)
were all hoping for uh furthermore (53:30 - 53:35)
additional artists participating in the (53:33 - 53:38)
contest will soon be selected to be (53:35 - 53:42)
among the top 300 finalists which is (53:38 - 53:44)
what no one expected them to do is to go (53:42 - 53:48)
back and pick new people yeah and then (53:44 - 53:49)
they said we are committed to upholding (53:48 - 53:51)
the Integrity of the Pokemon TCG (53:49 - 53:53)
illustration contest appreciate fans (53:51 - 53:55)
continued support as we celebrate the (53:53 - 53:57)
artistic abilities of t of The Talented (53:55 - 54:00)
Pokemon (53:57 - 54:00)
Community F fantastic I (54:00 - 54:07)
don&#39;t me being excited about this and (54:03 - 54:10)
like applauding the Pokemon company (54:07 - 54:13)
doesn&#39;t dis dis (54:10 - 54:17)
uh doesn&#39;t mean I wasn&#39;t upset or anyone (54:13 - 54:20)
wasn&#39;t annoyed that this got (54:17 - 54:23)
throughh like both can be true at the (54:20 - 54:25)
same time you can be like annoyed that (54:23 - 54:29)
AI art got through or multiple or VK had (54:25 - 54:31)
how however many entries got through (54:29 - 54:35)
super annoying super sucks hopefully in (54:31 - 54:38)
the future they figure out a way to (54:35 - 54:42)
better handle that but the way they (54:38 - 54:45)
handled this of being like hey we messed (54:42 - 54:48)
up we we&#39;re disqualifying those people (54:45 - 54:51)
and we&#39;re picking new people (54:48 - 54:55)
was the best possible outcome I think (54:51 - 54:57)
considering we didn&#39;t even think they&#39;re (54:55 - 55:00)
going to respond at (54:57 - 55:05)
all this was amazing um I&#39;ll keep I&#39;ll (55:00 - 55:08)
keep a little skepticism in waiting to (55:05 - 55:11)
see who actually got (55:08 - 55:14)
disqualified all the artist on the 300 (55:11 - 55:16)
website are still there yeah yeah like (55:14 - 55:18)
let&#39;s just I mean I think this is great (55:16 - 55:22)
and I yeah to your point I was saying (55:18 - 55:23)
last week I didn&#39;t think they were going (55:22 - 55:26)
to say anything and just maybe move them (55:23 - 55:28)
out and keep moving on but so I think (55:26 - 55:31)
this is all really great I am interested (55:28 - 55:35)
to see what pictures aren&#39;t there and (55:31 - 55:37)
like I&#39;m sure there will be a website or (55:35 - 55:38)
some whatever that will be like well (55:37 - 55:40)
here&#39;s the pictures that are no longer (55:38 - 55:43)
in the top 300 um so we&#39;ll know bedia (55:40 - 55:44)
already has it documented oh do that (55:43 - 55:46)
yeah of course so bedia already has all (55:44 - 55:49)
300 on their website so as soon as we (55:46 - 55:53)
see the new ones yeah we should be able (55:49 - 55:56)
to very easily tell who isn&#39;t there who (55:53 - 55:58)
exactly disqualified yeah so that&#39;ll be (55:56 - 56:00)
interesting to (55:58 - 56:03)
see uh how many more than just you know (56:00 - 56:05)
because we you as we were saying it&#39;s (56:03 - 56:07)
not just those six images it&#39;s just that (56:05 - 56:09)
those ones were the ones that were being (56:07 - 56:12)
focused on because of because they broke (56:09 - 56:15)
multiple multiple rules apparently but (56:12 - 56:17)
yeah that&#39;ll be interesting to see um (56:15 - 56:20)
how many are getting replaced as well I (56:17 - 56:23)
really hope it&#39;s not like 150 of them go (56:20 - 56:27)
away something like that no I (56:23 - 56:32)
I&#39;m also curious because uh once the 300 (56:27 - 56:35)
were picked you were finally able then (56:32 - 56:37)
to show off your art like you couldn&#39;t (56:35 - 56:41)
show it off earlier so I don&#39;t (56:37 - 56:44)
think those artists would be like (56:41 - 56:46)
disqualified for being reentered because (56:44 - 56:49)
they did follow the rules completely mhm (56:46 - 56:53)
so it would be I&#39;m I&#39;m sure like maybe (56:49 - 56:56)
one or two who have shown their art (56:53 - 56:58)
already would be like oh my gosh I got (56:56 - 57:01)
accepted in which would be very (56:58 - 57:05)
cool I guess they probably had I I it&#39;s (57:01 - 57:07)
so hard to guess because it&#39;s like how (57:05 - 57:09)
did these AI art or how did these (57:07 - 57:11)
multiple entries get through but I would (57:09 - 57:12)
I would guess that there were some that (57:11 - 57:15)
were like just bubbled out of the 300 (57:12 - 57:17)
that were like oh these (57:15 - 57:19)
were if we had more spots these would (57:17 - 57:21)
have got picked oh like Runner like (57:19 - 57:25)
Runners up for that portion of it yeah (57:21 - 57:27)
maybe I I&#39;m sure your point I mean who (57:25 - 57:30)
knows based on what got through if they (57:27 - 57:32)
had stuff waiting in (57:30 - 57:36)
the and I&#39;m sure that like they need to (57:32 - 57:38)
have those conversations with people of (57:36 - 57:41)
like do you want to be in our top 300 (57:38 - 57:42)
kind of thing or like we sent you an (57:41 - 57:44)
email you didn&#39;t respond you have to (57:42 - 57:46)
respond in order to get accepted kind of (57:44 - 57:47)
thing (57:46 - 57:50)
so who this was (57:47 - 57:53)
like exactly a week ago it it came out (57:50 - 57:54)
like (57:53 - 57:57)
literally Monday night at after the (57:54 - 58:00)
podcast went up so I of (57:57 - 58:04)
course I don&#39;t I I never expect speed (58:00 - 58:06)
with the Pokemon company (58:04 - 58:10)
I yeah I don&#39;t ever expect them to do (58:06 - 58:12)
anything (58:10 - 58:16)
quickly yeah or showing that much like (58:12 - 58:18)
showing that they made a mistake in that (58:16 - 58:20)
way it&#39;s just not typically something (58:18 - 58:22)
that they do like that they acknowledge (58:20 - 58:25)
to that to that extent I feel like uh so (58:22 - 58:27)
that&#39;s nice to see that (58:25 - 58:28)
yeah and them saying we are committed to (58:27 - 58:32)
upholding the Integrity of this contest (58:28 - 58:33)
and appreciate the fans continued (58:32 - 58:34)
support (58:33 - 58:37)
just what they&#39;re doing here actually (58:34 - 58:40)
shows that MH which statements like that (58:37 - 58:44)
aren&#39;t always that way so it&#39;s really (58:40 - 58:45)
good to (58:44 - 58:47)
see I would (58:45 - 58:50)
be to me that last sentence also makes (58:47 - 58:53)
it seem like we want to continue doing (58:50 - 58:55)
this yes I was going to say this will (58:53 - 58:56)
not be the last illustration com contest (58:55 - 59:00)
based on that last that last sentence (58:56 - 59:01)
because they could have easily thrown in (59:00 - 59:04)
the towel and be like we disqualified (59:01 - 59:07)
him no new entries we&#39;re going to pick (59:04 - 59:08)
some winners we&#39;re never going to do (59:07 - 59:09)
this (59:08 - 59:13)
again yeah them if they had done that if (59:09 - 59:14)
they didn&#39;t pick new winners or like new (59:13 - 59:16)
entrance if they didn&#39;t if they were (59:14 - 59:19)
just like hey we noticed this and (59:16 - 59:22)
they&#39;re gone it would make me believe (59:19 - 59:24)
more so this could be the last one but (59:22 - 59:26)
literally that last sentence IM just (59:24 - 59:29)
made me immediately think ah they (59:26 - 59:30)
definitely want to keep doing these (59:29 - 59:33)
kinds of things I mean on the list of (59:30 - 59:36)
judges are a lot of the executives of (59:33 - 59:40)
the Pokemon company and of everybody who (59:36 - 59:41)
runs the (59:40 - 59:42)
TCG (59:41 - 59:46)
I just having any sort of Integrity (59:42 - 59:48)
questioned there yeah with these having (59:46 - 59:51)
made it through in the first place I (59:48 - 59:53)
think that may be an element of why (59:51 - 59:57)
they&#39;re responding to it MH yeah I just (59:53 - 59:58)
don&#39;t (59:57 - 60:01)
think four executives are looking at (59:58 - 60:05)
20,000 pieces of art I I think one would (60:01 - 60:07)
hope they would at least glance through (60:05 - 60:09)
the 300 though I still really really (60:07 - 60:10)
want to hope that someone looked through (60:09 - 60:13)
the list of 300 before it was published (60:10 - 60:17)
and somehow just missed all the (60:13 - 60:21)
things it&#39;s it it&#39;s a lot like even when (60:17 - 60:24)
I&#39;m like looking at art on Twitter or (60:21 - 60:26)
wherever (60:24 - 60:28)
like you you you kind of just scroll (60:26 - 60:29)
past and you&#39;re like well that&#39;s good (60:28 - 60:31)
and then you kind of just keep (60:29 - 60:34)
scrolling but but now I feel like with (60:31 - 60:36)
AI I have to (60:34 - 60:39)
like stop yeah I mean that&#39;s not just (60:36 - 60:42)
with art either it&#39;s with yeah any image (60:39 - 60:44)
at this point (60:42 - 60:48)
yeah I&#39;m sure if you&#39;re like a (60:44 - 60:51)
recruiter you just like start reading (60:48 - 60:53)
the same sentences in like cover letters (60:51 - 60:56)
or resum√©s or whatnot because that has (60:53 - 60:58)
been like a big tool for people to use (60:56 - 61:02)
when trying to apply for jobs mhm (60:58 - 61:05)
mhm yeah I mean so yeah you&#39;re you&#39;re (61:02 - 61:08)
right not just not just art that as far (61:05 - 61:10)
as like recruiters and cover letters and (61:08 - 61:12)
resumes and things like that that goes (61:10 - 61:13)
beyond that though I mean there&#39;s been (61:12 - 61:15)
all kinds of templates and things like (61:13 - 61:17)
that for years that yeah it also goes (61:15 - 61:20)
both ways there are plenty of AI things (61:17 - 61:22)
dismissing cover letters and resum√©s and (61:20 - 61:24)
making it harder to get a job there too (61:22 - 61:26)
so go in both ways there (61:24 - 61:29)
yep we found out that Pokemon was using (61:26 - 61:32)
AI to scam the 20,000 that&#39;s a (61:29 - 61:34)
conversation topic I was going to bring (61:32 - 61:36)
of last week but I didn&#39;t feel like (61:34 - 61:38)
going down that (61:36 - 61:41)
path yeah I think I think worst case (61:38 - 61:43)
scenario was they don&#39;t say (61:41 - 61:46)
anything at all and then when they do (61:43 - 61:48)
their first round is elimination the AI (61:46 - 61:50)
art or the multiple entrance were gone (61:48 - 61:52)
but they don&#39;t acknowledge it I think (61:50 - 61:54)
that would have been like worst case (61:52 - 61:55)
scenario no worst case scenario would (61:54 - 61:59)
have been if the art one oh (61:55 - 62:01)
yeah yeah I guess that would be Rock (61:59 - 62:05)
Bottom if VK if vk&#39;s (62:01 - 62:05)
Eevee where like the the the arm is like (62:07 - 62:12)
merging with the head and then they (62:10 - 62:15)
become a career artist for the TCG that (62:12 - 62:18)
would have been the worst case (62:15 - 62:18)
scenario um I I want to talk about TCG (62:19 - 62:26)
live for a second uh they celebrated the (62:23 - 62:27)
one year (62:26 - 62:30)
anniversary whatever that means of an (62:27 - 62:33)
app that doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s fully (62:30 - 62:36)
it&#39;s been around for a year technically (62:33 - 62:36)
I (62:36 - 62:41)
guess longer than it&#39;s I mean it&#39;s (62:36 - 62:45)
definitely yeah it&#39;s definitely software (62:41 - 62:47)
I was so excited when I had the the (62:45 - 62:49)
thought of being able to finally play (62:47 - 62:53)
TCG online on my phone right because (62:49 - 62:55)
that is the thing that is on me for the (62:53 - 62:59)
most part right or anything else um and (62:55 - 63:01)
then it was just like that experience I (62:59 - 63:03)
was like I give me the other one back (63:01 - 63:05)
I&#39;ll go grab my computer to play still (63:03 - 63:09)
waiting for pocket yes so I played a lot (63:05 - 63:11)
of (63:09 - 63:14)
ptcg the original one the one was the (63:11 - 63:16)
one that was made by Dire Wolf digital (63:14 - 63:20)
PCG right oh yeah s ptcg yeah Pokemon (63:16 - 63:22)
Trading Card Game Online the original (63:20 - 63:25)
one played a lot I remember when they (63:22 - 63:26)
added the code cards to the booster (63:25 - 63:30)
packs I remember that back in the day (63:26 - 63:32)
when you redeemed a code card you could (63:30 - 63:34)
cash it in for any booster pack you (63:32 - 63:36)
wanted which was cool you could get like (63:34 - 63:38)
an emerging Powers but cash it in for (63:36 - 63:40)
like a Noble (63:38 - 63:43)
Victors I remember the launch of that (63:40 - 63:48)
app and I played it on and off um and (63:43 - 63:50)
then when I started streaming which was (63:48 - 63:53)
like six years ago uh it was one of the (63:50 - 63:55)
games I played cuz it was really easy to (63:53 - 63:56)
stream it was already your computer you (63:55 - 63:59)
just window capture the screen um it was (63:56 - 64:03)
a great way to just chat with people in (63:59 - 64:06)
between matches and (64:03 - 64:10)
play and I grew quite a collection also (64:06 - 64:12)
it was really easy to go to eBay and buy (64:10 - 64:14)
100 code cards for like $20 and then (64:12 - 64:17)
just have them get all redeemed and suck (64:14 - 64:18)
them all (64:17 - 64:20)
inh it was really easy to play it was (64:18 - 64:23)
also great to like stream it was fun to (64:20 - 64:25)
open packs and I&#39;ve played a lot of (64:23 - 64:26)
games I Apex (64:25 - 64:29)
Legends uh Clash (64:26 - 64:33)
Royale whatever Pokemon whatever you hit (64:29 - 64:34)
the little button and it does an (64:33 - 64:36)
animation and then the things pop up and (64:34 - 64:39)
you get like a special card or a gold or (64:36 - 64:40)
or a platinum or an ultra rare right (64:39 - 64:42)
like that animation feels good like (64:40 - 64:44)
OverWatch has it a bunch of games have (64:42 - 64:47)
it people like opening fancy (64:44 - 64:52)
boxes it&#39;s just a thing it&#39;s true uh (64:47 - 64:55)
true TCG live never looked particularly (64:52 - 64:58)
good good some some aspects of the game (64:55 - 64:59)
look good but man the Character Creator (64:58 - 65:02)
looks terrible if trying to customize (64:59 - 65:05)
your character they added a battle pass (65:02 - 65:07)
which was cool but you couldn&#39;t like you (65:05 - 65:09)
you can&#39;t give the game money which has (65:07 - 65:12)
always been weird to me in both Pokemon (65:09 - 65:15)
Trading Card Game online and TCG is (65:12 - 65:18)
there&#39;s just no way to give it any money (65:15 - 65:21)
which I don&#39;t want to go to eBay and (65:18 - 65:24)
spend $30 and then copy and paste the (65:21 - 65:26)
codes like just let me buy the booster (65:24 - 65:30)
packs in the game I just want to (65:26 - 65:30)
play I didn&#39;t give PT toel a lot of time (65:30 - 65:35)
like I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever played a (65:34 - 65:38)
full match in it ever uh because it&#39;s (65:35 - 65:40)
just I haven&#39;t been into the like I (65:38 - 65:42)
haven&#39;t had that itch recently to play (65:40 - 65:44)
TCG also every time I look at the (65:42 - 65:47)
character I&#39;m just like this is terrible (65:44 - 65:50)
also I have a stack of cards that I just (65:47 - 65:53)
don&#39;t want to scan in and redeem it&#39;s (65:50 - 65:56)
just such a hassle to scan in a QR bar (65:53 - 65:58)
code and redeem it if I could get like a (65:56 - 66:00)
grocery Barcode (65:58 - 66:02)
Scanner that would be tight but I don&#39;t (66:00 - 66:05)
they took away the uh you used to be (66:02 - 66:06)
able to hold the code card up in front (66:05 - 66:09)
of your camera and so it would just scan (66:06 - 66:10)
it right and then you just and then it (66:09 - 66:13)
would list all the things scan scan and (66:10 - 66:15)
then you just hit you know whatever and (66:13 - 66:17)
it redeemed 10 of them and you scan scan (66:15 - 66:19)
scan scan and they took that away you (66:17 - 66:21)
have to do it on your phone now yeah oh (66:19 - 66:23)
can you even can you it&#39;s been a long (66:21 - 66:24)
time since I&#39;ve like actually tried to (66:23 - 66:26)
use the app can you actually (66:24 - 66:28)
uh do it on your phone CU before you had (66:26 - 66:30)
to actually type it in no you you can I (66:28 - 66:33)
did this um I did this for like 20 (66:30 - 66:35)
here&#39;s here&#39;s the actual thing this is (66:33 - 66:38)
this is now pocket makes way more sense (66:35 - 66:41)
in TCG (66:38 - 66:44)
o it was very fun to open a booster pack (66:41 - 66:48)
it had a good OverWatch opening (66:44 - 66:53)
animation in in Pocket it is miserable (66:48 - 66:56)
in TCG live you mean oh yeah sorry in (66:53 - 66:57)
TCG live there&#39;s so many TCG apps I&#39;m (66:56 - 67:00)
sorry in TCG live it&#39;s miserable I used (66:57 - 67:04)
my iPhone I scanned them all in the the (67:00 - 67:06)
app was open on the computer and then (67:04 - 67:08)
nothing happened and my twitch chat was (67:06 - 67:12)
like you have to either do a match or (67:08 - 67:14)
for the packs to like pop up or you have (67:12 - 67:17)
to close the app and reopen it and I was (67:14 - 67:19)
like I ain&#39;t doing no match Clos the app (67:17 - 67:20)
I reopened (67:19 - 67:22)
it (67:20 - 67:26)
and you can open like one booster pack (67:22 - 67:29)
at a time but it&#39;s not nearly as cool as (67:26 - 67:32)
it was in ptcg it&#39;s so slow and there&#39;s (67:29 - 67:35)
an open all and if you click that it (67:32 - 67:37)
just gives you a list of all the cards (67:35 - 67:39)
and like the the 20 booster packs you (67:37 - 67:41)
opened it is (67:39 - 67:43)
so (67:41 - 67:47)
sterile and straightforward but I get it (67:43 - 67:50)
because it&#39;s they just want you to do (67:47 - 67:52)
matches that&#39;s all it is yeah and I (67:50 - 67:57)
think the steril of it is purpose (67:52 - 68:01)
because they knew that a card collecting (67:57 - 68:04)
app was coming and that app will have (68:01 - 68:07)
the Fun open the booster back animation (68:04 - 68:10)
and collect there is no trading in ptcg (68:07 - 68:13)
there is no great opening animation (68:10 - 68:16)
there you can&#39;t once you get four of a (68:13 - 68:18)
card any future card gets just turned (68:16 - 68:20)
into dust you can use that dust to buy (68:18 - 68:22)
Cards you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re (68:20 - 68:27)
missing to build a deck it is very (68:22 - 68:27)
it is a very sterile version of Pokemon (68:28 - 68:32)
Trading Card Game (68:30 - 68:37)
Online which I don&#39;t think is good (68:32 - 68:41)
unless they and I&#39;m sure they do they (68:37 - 68:44)
understand that we have an audience that (68:41 - 68:45)
doesn&#39;t care about collecting that (68:44 - 68:48)
doesn&#39;t care about trading they just (68:45 - 68:51)
want to use this game to practice MH and (68:48 - 68:52)
then we have an audience that does care (68:51 - 68:55)
about collecting and trading and they (68:52 - 68:58)
want that that fancy Clash Royale box (68:55 - 69:01)
opening animation and when they were in (68:58 - 69:03)
an app it wasn&#39;t working so we&#39;re (69:01 - 69:07)
separating them out to be two different (69:03 - 69:07)
apps I agree with that I I mean I I (69:07 - 69:13)
agree like a really weird line to draw (69:11 - 69:16)
but well cuz the cards at least from (69:13 - 69:18)
what they&#39;ve shown so far the cards in (69:16 - 69:22)
Pocket aren&#39;t actual card like they&#39;re (69:18 - 69:24)
not the same as the physical (69:22 - 69:28)
cards where whereas obviously the cards (69:24 - 69:30)
in TCG live are the same as like the (69:28 - 69:36)
physical cards mhm So to that point (69:30 - 69:38)
you&#39;re you&#39;re dealing (69:36 - 69:41)
with different cards I like I it&#39;s not (69:38 - 69:44)
like people who enjoy the physical cards (69:41 - 69:46)
want like a digital version of that it&#39;s (69:44 - 69:47)
going to be that will be different with (69:46 - 69:50)
pocket that&#39;s not going to be one to one (69:47 - 69:53)
in the way that it is with TCG life so (69:50 - 69:55)
you&#39;re going to have TCG cards and (69:53 - 69:57)
you&#39;re have pocket cards that&#39;s going to (69:55 - 70:00)
be fun to talk about the distinction (69:57 - 70:03)
between but I think people in live care (70:00 - 70:05)
about their cards I mean they care about (70:03 - 70:08)
the cards in the sense of like I have (70:05 - 70:11)
these cards to build a deck mhm but (70:08 - 70:12)
there&#39;s not (70:11 - 70:16)
like in in Pokemon Trading Card Game (70:12 - 70:19)
Online there was like a collection area (70:16 - 70:21)
where you could see if you completed a (70:19 - 70:23)
collection there was also a trading area (70:21 - 70:26)
where you could trade like I got a full (70:23 - 70:30)
art Cynthia but most of the trades were (70:26 - 70:34)
I&#39;m not looking for a specific card I&#39;m (70:30 - 70:36)
looking for like boost like booster (70:34 - 70:38)
packs ended up being the valuable (70:36 - 70:40)
currency unopened booster packs were (70:38 - 70:43)
tradable in online so you&#39;d be like oh I (70:40 - 70:46)
really need this card so I&#39;m going to (70:43 - 70:49)
trade booster packs or I have extras of (70:46 - 70:51)
a really good card so I&#39;m gonna also (70:49 - 70:53)
trade those for booster packs it (70:51 - 70:56)
was and obviously the the (70:53 - 70:57)
in doing (70:56 - 71:00)
so the (70:57 - 71:04)
currency of that game was so weighted on (71:00 - 71:07)
how good or not good a booster pack was (71:04 - 71:09)
MH that it was really weird so they cut (71:07 - 71:14)
trading out alog together in (71:09 - 71:17)
live and there&#39;s a limit on how many (71:14 - 71:18)
packs you can scan so I think you can (71:17 - 71:21)
only scan like three or 400 booster (71:18 - 71:23)
packs and then it caps out completely (71:21 - 71:27)
because for I don&#39;t for re need to have (71:23 - 71:30)
unopen booster packs anymore in TCG live (71:27 - 71:34)
right I don&#39;t think that like these code (71:30 - 71:38)
cards that come in the the physical (71:34 - 71:39)
booster packs I don&#39;t think they&#39;re (71:38 - 71:42)
going to work for pocket I think pocket (71:39 - 71:44)
is like oh you want more than your two (71:42 - 71:46)
free booster packs a day you can give us (71:44 - 71:49)
money yeah they&#39;ve they&#39;ve openly said (71:46 - 71:50)
there&#39;s going to be microtransactions in (71:49 - 71:53)
pocket right yes yeah or at least they (71:50 - 71:55)
said it&#39;s free to start free to play one (71:53 - 71:59)
of those things is hidden is the motto (71:55 - 72:02)
for pay us money yeah so I guess I guess (71:59 - 72:05)
the the realization after all this for (72:02 - 72:08)
after the last year of like why is TCG (72:05 - 72:13)
live so bad I think it&#39;s now making (72:08 - 72:16)
sense I don&#39;t know if I would say I (72:13 - 72:17)
don&#39;t know if I would go so far as to (72:16 - 72:21)
say it was intentionally made (72:17 - 72:24)
bad no but like but I think this may (72:21 - 72:28)
have been one way they are saving things (72:24 - 72:31)
that there was a opening for a game that (72:28 - 72:33)
people would enjoy that is kind of (72:31 - 72:36)
comparable to say very popular games (72:33 - 72:39)
like Marvel snap and things like that (72:36 - 72:41)
where they could reintroduce the (72:39 - 72:44)
elements that the newer TCG app was (72:41 - 72:45)
published (72:44 - 72:47)
without that maybe they didn&#39;t think (72:45 - 72:51)
those were not needed somehow yes I I (72:47 - 72:52)
can&#39;t imagine that (72:51 - 72:56)
like pocket and live weren&#39;t being (72:52 - 72:58)
developed around the same time right (72:56 - 73:01)
like I don&#39;t think pocket is a oh live (72:58 - 73:03)
is bad we need a we need a solution I (73:01 - 73:05)
think it not (73:03 - 73:09)
necessarily no but they saw games I (73:05 - 73:10)
think there are there are something to (73:09 - 73:13)
be said for those games that are like (73:10 - 73:17)
Marvel snap are very popular and they (73:13 - 73:20)
are able to do something similar to that (73:17 - 73:22)
like I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know that they (73:20 - 73:24)
developed Pokemon I I don&#39;t feel like (73:22 - 73:26)
they developed PCT (73:24 - 73:28)
whatever that is live I don&#39;t think they (73:26 - 73:30)
they develop (73:28 - 73:33)
live with the intention of we&#39;re going (73:30 - 73:34)
to take all this stuff out and put it (73:33 - 73:36)
into another app like I don&#39;t think that (73:34 - 73:38)
development like those meetings weren&#39;t (73:36 - 73:39)
happening like that where they were (73:38 - 73:40)
saying okay well let&#39;s remove all of (73:39 - 73:42)
this stuff and now I think that what (73:40 - 73:45)
they were doing was saying hey people (73:42 - 73:48)
that play the online game like what do (73:45 - 73:49)
they want right they want to get their (73:48 - 73:51)
packs opened so that they can you know (73:49 - 73:52)
especially because you don&#39;t need unop (73:51 - 73:54)
booster packs anymore um so they want to (73:52 - 73:56)
get their pack open so they see what (73:54 - 73:57)
cards they have they want to be able to (73:56 - 73:59)
trade those cards in for the the (73:57 - 74:02)
currency to get the cards they actually (73:59 - 74:04)
need and they want to play the game I I (74:02 - 74:05)
do think that that is a majority of the (74:04 - 74:09)
people that play the online game do want (74:05 - 74:12)
it to actually play the online game more (74:09 - 74:15)
than digitally collect the cards I think (74:12 - 74:16)
being able to collect them and have that (74:15 - 74:18)
collection part as well was was really (74:16 - 74:22)
cool in pcgo and I think that people did (74:18 - 74:24)
take I think I said that correctly and (74:22 - 74:27)
um and people did take advant of that (74:24 - 74:30)
but I think that they know a majority of (74:27 - 74:32)
the people playing really just wanted to (74:30 - 74:34)
get down to being able to play the game (74:32 - 74:36)
and so they took things out (74:34 - 74:40)
that were kind of unnecessary in that (74:36 - 74:42)
way to get people to allow them to play (74:40 - 74:44)
the game quicker because again you&#39;re (74:42 - 74:46)
not giving them any money there&#39;s no way (74:44 - 74:49)
to give live money so it&#39;s not like they (74:46 - 74:50)
were like we need people playing more (74:49 - 74:52)
and more and more so that there&#39;s any (74:50 - 74:56)
money making here uh there it&#39;s just (74:52 - 74:58)
people want to play the game and they&#39;re (74:56 - 75:01)
getting them to playing the game quicker (74:58 - 75:04)
and then alternatively you do have a (75:01 - 75:06)
group of people who want to do more (75:04 - 75:08)
collecting but you also have a a style (75:06 - 75:12)
of game where it&#39;s like a card game but (75:08 - 75:13)
it&#39;s a little bit more simplistic right (75:12 - 75:16)
and that&#39;s what this is supposed to be (75:13 - 75:18)
is yeah we don&#39;t know fully what that (75:16 - 75:21)
looks like right but it seems like it (75:18 - 75:24)
based on the way the cards looked and (75:21 - 75:26)
and and how the match were going to be (75:24 - 75:28)
quicker and things like that it just (75:26 - 75:29)
seems like there&#39;s going to be a bit (75:28 - 75:31)
more of a simplistic way to play the (75:29 - 75:33)
game and people like that too so I think (75:31 - 75:36)
it just I think it just works out well (75:33 - 75:38)
but I don&#39;t think that they made P I (75:36 - 75:40)
don&#39;t think they were like making live (75:38 - 75:41)
and they&#39;re like oh we have this whole (75:40 - 75:44)
collection part and someone&#39;s like no (75:41 - 75:46)
take that out that&#39;s gonna go into a (75:44 - 75:47)
separate app like I don&#39;t think that&#39;s (75:46 - 75:50)
how the meetings (75:47 - 75:50)
went I don&#39;t know (75:50 - 75:55)
like I feel like it&#39;s real I feel like (75:55 - 75:59)
there&#39;s part of me that&#39;s like it&#39;s real (75:57 - 76:01)
intentional that opening a booster pack (75:59 - 76:06)
in live is not the same experience as (76:01 - 76:08)
online I think that&#39;s intentional as (76:06 - 76:10)
well but I think it&#39;s because they know (76:08 - 76:11)
a majority of their players just want to (76:10 - 76:15)
get to playing the game honestly I think (76:11 - 76:17)
there is a group of people me being one (76:15 - 76:20)
of them I I really enjoyed the like pack (76:17 - 76:24)
opening stuff when it came to online um (76:20 - 76:26)
that&#39;s actually what first got me into (76:24 - 76:28)
playing online was more of the (76:26 - 76:30)
collection aspect of being like Oh I can (76:28 - 76:32)
digitally collect cards and things like (76:30 - 76:35)
that um was actually what got me playing (76:32 - 76:36)
it a little bit more and then I started (76:35 - 76:38)
actually playing the game more once I (76:36 - 76:42)
had the app open more often but I do (76:38 - 76:43)
think they know that a majority of their (76:42 - 76:45)
player base wants to just play the game (76:43 - 76:46)
and this allows them to get to that (76:45 - 76:50)
faster you keep saying that but isn&#39;t (76:46 - 76:52)
that part of the app bad (76:50 - 76:55)
too playing the game oh I&#39;m not saying (76:52 - 76:57)
good I think this is why I&#39;m playing it (76:55 - 77:01)
the most popular deck aw in the format (76:57 - 77:04)
right now is broken in TCG live it (77:01 - 77:07)
doesn&#39;t work yeah I I don&#39;t know if any (77:04 - 77:09)
of the bad things are intentional I (77:07 - 77:12)
think the app is just bad the app is (77:09 - 77:14)
just bad but I think that some of the (77:12 - 77:17)
things like making the pack opening (77:14 - 77:19)
because in the pack opening you also (77:17 - 77:21)
don&#39;t see all the cards in a pack yeah I (77:19 - 77:23)
opened some packs that&#39;s the only thing (77:21 - 77:26)
I use that app to do yeah (77:23 - 77:28)
I I think it&#39;s just bad I don&#39;t think (77:26 - 77:30)
making it bad was intentional I think (77:28 - 77:32)
it&#39;s just bad you can&#39;t even look at (77:30 - 77:35)
your collection though it takes a lot of (77:32 - 77:38)
work you can I think because I&#39;ve gone (77:35 - 77:40)
in to make sure I&#39;ve gone in to make (77:38 - 77:43)
sure I reded things correctly you can (77:40 - 77:45)
look at your collection only for my (77:43 - 77:46)
understanding only if you&#39;re building a (77:45 - 77:51)
deck yeah right so that&#39;s to my point I (77:46 - 77:53)
I don&#39;t I think that the app is bad but (77:51 - 77:55)
I think I think part part of it were (77:53 - 77:58)
taken out to get people to the game (77:55 - 78:01)
playing experience quicker and maybe (77:58 - 78:03)
that made it worse in itself but I do (78:01 - 78:05)
think that there were certain things (78:03 - 78:07)
taken out for the purpose of getting (78:05 - 78:10)
people to play to playing games quicker (78:07 - 78:12)
this this is my my assumption my (78:10 - 78:17)
assumption is that they saw the success (78:12 - 78:21)
of Marvel snap or Yu-Gi-Oh duel links or (78:17 - 78:27)
the hundreds of similar apps like uh WWE (78:21 - 78:29)
Superstar Card Collector or whatever (78:27 - 78:32)
that was a I played that thing I it was (78:29 - 78:34)
around a while ago was it that was a (78:32 - 78:37)
long long time ago that remember that (78:34 - 78:39)
there&#39;s a lot of these apps and I think (78:37 - 78:43)
they saw that and they they were like we (78:39 - 78:46)
we want to do this for Pokemon cards it (78:43 - 78:49)
makes complete sense it&#39;s like an easy (78:46 - 78:52)
thing like WWE is doing it Yu-Gi-Oh is (78:49 - 78:54)
doing it Marvel is doing it we can do it (78:52 - 78:58)
too and we can be better at that but (78:54 - 79:02)
then you have this problem where TCG (78:58 - 79:05)
exists where that would cause some sort (79:02 - 79:06)
of Market (79:05 - 79:10)
confusion right and so then you and and (79:06 - 79:12)
possibly you&#39;re not happy with your your (79:10 - 79:15)
contract with direwolf digital because (79:12 - 79:16)
they they were the ones that got screwed (79:15 - 79:19)
over the most from this and you also (79:16 - 79:23)
consider that TCGO was primarily an (79:19 - 79:25)
American product (79:23 - 79:29)
mhm uh it doesn&#39;t work in Japan I think (79:25 - 79:30)
it had like German support it had (79:29 - 79:33)
Spanish support but at the end of the (79:30 - 79:36)
day it was an American company making an (79:33 - 79:39)
American focused maybe a North America (79:36 - 79:41)
product if you want to be generous about (79:39 - 79:45)
that it was not big in the west (79:41 - 79:49)
at in the east at (79:45 - 79:49)
all he&#39;s being like the Asia countries (79:49 - 79:55)
yeah got it and so (79:52 - 79:58)
you find a new you do you do the in you (79:55 - 80:01)
do the development (79:58 - 80:01)
inhouse and you make a replacement for (80:01 - 80:06)
that because you can&#39;t get rid of it (80:05 - 80:09)
completely but you purposely leave out (80:06 - 80:11)
the things that you&#39;re going to put into (80:09 - 80:13)
pocket good animations (80:11 - 80:16)
microtransactions a better collection (80:13 - 80:19)
trading the common thing you see when (80:16 - 80:21)
people are talking about this is why are (80:19 - 80:24)
there two apps there&#39;s already Market (80:21 - 80:26)
confusion but I but that marketing (80:24 - 80:27)
confusion is probably coming from people (80:26 - 80:30)
who don&#39;t play live like they those (80:27 - 80:33)
those people myself included (80:30 - 80:36)
initially but once you play live and you (80:33 - 80:41)
log into that terrible app you go oh I (80:36 - 80:43)
understand that these are very different (80:41 - 80:45)
products but again if you if you&#39;ve (80:43 - 80:46)
never played live you&#39;re like why are (80:45 - 80:49)
there two card (80:46 - 80:52)
apps like when pocket comes out you mean (80:49 - 80:54)
well right well like right now people (80:52 - 80:56)
are like why is pocket and live the same (80:54 - 80:58)
like why do they have two card apps (80:56 - 80:59)
right (80:58 - 81:02)
but everything pocket is offering (80:59 - 81:04)
confusing yeah oh I&#39;m sure I&#39;m sure it (81:02 - 81:07)
will still be a bit confusing but it (81:04 - 81:09)
would be even more confusing if they (81:07 - 81:13)
didn&#39;t kill online (81:09 - 81:13)
for for live I I just don&#39;t I don&#39;t (81:14 - 81:22)
think it it goes like that because the (81:17 - 81:24)
online game is connected to the physical (81:22 - 81:26)
game (81:24 - 81:29)
like there there would be no online game (81:26 - 81:32)
if the physical game didn&#39;t first like (81:29 - 81:34)
wasn&#39;t first around right that the (81:32 - 81:36)
physical game was around and then they (81:34 - 81:37)
wanted a way for people to be able to (81:36 - 81:39)
play that game when they&#39;re not able to (81:37 - 81:41)
go out to their local store or to a (81:39 - 81:43)
tournament or whatever it may be so they (81:41 - 81:45)
create an online version of that game (81:43 - 81:47)
now they can play it from home right and (81:45 - 81:49)
there&#39;s that but that connection will (81:47 - 81:51)
always be there between online or live (81:49 - 81:53)
or whatever they want to call the (81:51 - 81:55)
terribly made app that they have made (81:53 - 81:57)
uh that will always be there that (81:55 - 81:58)
connection will always be there to the (81:57 - 82:00)
physical game especially with the fact (81:58 - 82:02)
that the only way to actually get cards (82:00 - 82:04)
one of the only ways to get cards in the (82:02 - 82:07)
online game is to buy physical packs or (82:04 - 82:12)
buy the booster codes like online but um (82:07 - 82:14)
this other game pocket I don&#39;t think (82:12 - 82:17)
it&#39;s going to have any connection to the (82:14 - 82:20)
physical cards other than the fact that (82:17 - 82:21)
the things you are playing with in the (82:20 - 82:24)
game are cards like are cards but I (82:21 - 82:25)
don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to be any (82:24 - 82:27)
connection to the physical cards that (82:25 - 82:30)
are out even as far as like making these (82:27 - 82:31)
cards in the in the game like immersive (82:30 - 82:33)
and things like that like there&#39;s just I (82:31 - 82:34)
don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to be any (82:33 - 82:36)
connection one day down the line maybe (82:34 - 82:38)
they do a special set where they&#39;re like (82:36 - 82:39)
oh this is going to take on the theme of (82:38 - 82:41)
pocket or something like that down the (82:39 - 82:44)
line but I just think that there&#39;s (82:41 - 82:47)
enough deviation from that that it&#39;s (82:44 - 82:49)
it&#39;s really going to be two separate (82:47 - 82:51)
games and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to (82:49 - 82:53)
be a whole lot of confusion once the (82:51 - 82:55)
game&#39;s actually once the game is (82:53 - 82:57)
actually out and and being played and (82:55 - 82:59)
being viewed and everything which is (82:57 - 83:01)
still really weird to me because I feel (82:59 - 83:03)
like you would want the collection app (83:01 - 83:07)
that is pocket to be able to have the (83:03 - 83:09)
same cards so that you can say oh I I (83:07 - 83:10)
got this one it&#39;s really pretty I really (83:09 - 83:12)
like this card I want a physical real (83:10 - 83:17)
one of it and then you can&#39;t go get that (83:12 - 83:20)
I don&#39;t know yeah that that is also a (83:17 - 83:22)
thing right that is definitely a thing (83:20 - 83:24)
with PC with uh I&#39;m going to stop with (83:22 - 83:25)
online (83:24 - 83:28)
um where I would get a card and then (83:25 - 83:29)
think you know it&#39;s like oh that would (83:28 - 83:30)
be really cool to like be able to (83:29 - 83:32)
actually hold that and you know look at (83:30 - 83:36)
that card that way um but going back to (83:32 - 83:38)
live being so (83:36 - 83:43)
bad they did not have enough time in my (83:38 - 83:47)
opinion to make it good so I do still (83:43 - 83:49)
think that like pocket and live were (83:47 - 83:53)
planned at the same time to replace (83:49 - 83:55)
ptcgo but live needed to come out as (83:53 - 83:57)
soon as possible because of the (83:55 - 83:59)
tournament structure because they they (83:57 - 84:03)
couldn&#39;t have that app go down and have (83:59 - 84:05)
nothing for people to play or practice (84:03 - 84:08)
in and that&#39;s why our models in that (84:05 - 84:09)
game look like they&#39;re from like kid (84:08 - 84:12)
pics they look so terrible like The Sims (84:09 - 84:16)
2 has better in-game models than (84:12 - 84:19)
whatever developer decided to like make (84:16 - 84:22)
the hair in it makes Pokemon go models (84:19 - 84:26)
look incredible yes like it is crazy how (84:22 - 84:30)
bad your character looks in live so I (84:26 - 84:31)
don&#39;t know this this is my big (84:30 - 84:33)
conspiracy theory that like for a long (84:31 - 84:35)
time they planned on separating these (84:33 - 84:38)
apps so they could dominate each market (84:35 - 84:41)
appropriately the competitive market (84:38 - 84:42)
that just wants to play and then the (84:41 - 84:43)
collector&#39;s (84:42 - 84:46)
market and they needed to ship out live (84:43 - 84:47)
as soon as possible because their (84:46 - 84:49)
contract with direwolf digital was (84:47 - 84:52)
ending and they needed everyone to (84:49 - 84:54)
transfer their accounts from online to (84:52 - 84:58)
live and like live is the one thing they (84:54 - 85:00)
openly said they were delaying it was (84:58 - 85:02)
supposed to come out before bdsp and (85:00 - 85:04)
then they were like actually we&#39;re (85:02 - 85:06)
verbally confirming that this is delayed (85:04 - 85:08)
and then it just kind of showed up in (85:06 - 85:11)
beta and then now it&#39;s like it&#39;s been (85:08 - 85:14)
out for a year has it it&#39;s it&#39;s been (85:11 - 85:16)
struggling for like the last like 18 (85:14 - 85:18)
months I guess thanks to the quackle hat (85:16 - 85:23)
that you can get I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I (85:18 - 85:25)
don&#39;t think it&#39;s like deeply malicious (85:23 - 85:28)
to like break your two break your app (85:25 - 85:32)
into two apps so it&#39;s easier for a (85:28 - 85:34)
consumer to be like I just care about (85:32 - 85:37)
collecting or I just care about battling (85:34 - 85:39)
I think that&#39;s fine and that makes sense (85:37 - 85:43)
I don&#39;t Mak easier but (85:39 - 85:47)
okay but I do think that this was the (85:43 - 85:51)
long plan that they had and (85:47 - 85:54)
the the further along we get I just to (85:51 - 85:57)
me it feels more apparent that like this (85:54 - 86:00)
was their plan all along was to break (85:57 - 86:03)
these apart to dominate their respective (86:00 - 86:07)
markets but we got one bad app because (86:03 - 86:10)
it needed to come out saap hopefully (86:07 - 86:12)
just one oh yeah hopefully I I believe (86:10 - 86:15)
in DNA oh I hope yeah I hope both of (86:12 - 86:18)
these apps aren&#39;t like 50% of what they (86:15 - 86:19)
could be if they were just together (86:18 - 86:25)
pocket looks good I do want to say for (86:19 - 86:25)
it is only (86:26 - 86:31)
available in Australia Canada Denmark (86:29 - 86:34)
Finland France Germany (86:31 - 86:37)
Italy Mexico Netherlands New Zealand (86:34 - 86:39)
Norway Sweden obviously the United (86:37 - 86:43)
States and then it&#39;s available (86:39 - 86:45)
in where were the I just saw the (86:43 - 86:48)
languages it was English French German (86:45 - 86:51)
Italian and (86:48 - 86:55)
Spanish H so no Japanese no Korean no (86:51 - 86:58)
traditional Chinese simplified Chinese (86:55 - 87:00)
does does the Japanese game have their (86:58 - 87:02)
own online game over there no they don&#39;t (87:00 - 87:04)
so they just don&#39;t play online at all (87:02 - 87:06)
they never had online they don&#39;t have (87:04 - 87:10)
live uh they they do the the the Niantic (87:06 - 87:11)
approach uh you know it&#39;s not called (87:10 - 87:13)
campfire but they really like their (87:11 - 87:15)
in-person experiences over there in (87:13 - 87:17)
Japan (87:15 - 87:21)
good uh it&#39;s very easy to do a (87:17 - 87:24)
local right they have Pokemon centers (87:21 - 87:26)
and they have so many opportunities to (87:24 - 87:28)
like play locally (87:26 - 87:31)
that I honestly think it you can compare (87:28 - 87:32)
it to Niantic they don&#39;t want to kill (87:31 - 87:36)
their local scene sure bye also I don&#39;t (87:32 - 87:39)
know if people know this uh America is (87:36 - 87:43)
much much bigger than Japan really huh (87:39 - 87:46)
crazy I know right no (87:43 - 87:50)
clue all right let&#39;s take a (87:46 - 87:54)
break and we are back from our break uh (87:50 - 87:59)
June 27th the 2025 Pokemon Championship (87:54 - 88:03)
Series has been updated they got new (87:59 - 88:06)
logos and whoever whoever did these (88:03 - 88:08)
logos went real hard on them they look (88:06 - 88:11)
great uh everything else maybe maybe not (88:08 - 88:15)
so great (88:11 - 88:15)
yeah uh I&#39;m like I&#39;m going to really (88:16 - 88:23)
simplify this and go through this pretty (88:20 - 88:25)
quickly (88:23 - 88:27)
um I guess the to Long didn&#39;t read is (88:25 - 88:31)
they&#39;re making it harder for people to (88:27 - 88:35)
qualify for worlds starting in 2025 That (88:31 - 88:38)
season will start at the end of August (88:35 - 88:42)
September because it starts after worlds (88:38 - 88:44)
uh they say the qualification system for (88:42 - 88:47)
the World Championships is changing uh a (88:44 - 88:49)
set number of players from each rating (88:47 - 88:52)
Zone age Division and game will earn (88:49 - 88:54)
invitations to the world championship (88:52 - 88:55)
based on their Championship point leader (88:54 - 88:58)
standing this update applies to the TCG (88:55 - 89:00)
video game and Pok√©mon go nothing about (88:58 - 89:02)
unite most invitations well that makes (89:00 - 89:04)
sense because it&#39;s like team based most (89:02 - 89:06)
invitations were based on a fixed CP (89:04 - 89:08)
threshold that players needed to (89:06 - 89:12)
accumulate in order to re receive an (89:08 - 89:13)
invitation in addition players who (89:12 - 89:15)
qualify for Via Championship points (89:13 - 89:18)
individual top performers at major (89:15 - 89:19)
events will automatically earn (89:18 - 89:21)
invitation to World Championships (89:19 - 89:23)
regionals and special Champions will (89:21 - 89:26)
also receive an invitation and the top (89:23 - 89:28)
four finishes of each International (89:26 - 89:30)
championships will also earn an (89:28 - 89:32)
invitation invites earned through this (89:30 - 89:35)
method will not count against the total (89:32 - 89:38)
invitation slots for a players rating (89:35 - 89:40)
Zone as a Pokemon championship series (89:38 - 89:42)
continues to grow that&#39;s the big issue (89:40 - 89:45)
there this adjustment will provide a (89:42 - 89:47)
variety of long-term benefits including (89:45 - 89:50)
balance balancing player qualifications (89:47 - 89:52)
across all rating zones to foster a (89:50 - 89:54)
diverse competition ensuring that we are (89:52 - 89:56)
prepared to provide the best comp (89:54 - 89:58)
competitor experience possible we look (89:56 - 90:00)
forward to sharing more about Point (89:58 - 90:02)
Season reward (90:00 - 90:04)
programs uh and which will operate (90:02 - 90:06)
similar to the fixed CP thresholds from (90:04 - 90:08)
recent (90:06 - 90:11)
years so if you&#39;re in the US and you&#39;re (90:08 - 90:14)
a master rank player you need (90:11 - 90:16)
125 (90:14 - 90:19)
sorry if you&#39;re a Pokemon TCG player in (90:16 - 90:21)
the master rank in the US they will be (90:19 - 90:25)
inviting 125 Masters (90:21 - 90:26)
for (90:25 - 90:29)
VGC they&#39;re only going to be inviting (90:26 - 90:33)
the top 75 Masters for us in Canada and (90:29 - 90:36)
then for Pokemon go master rank would be (90:33 - 90:40)
75 as well what does this (90:36 - 90:40)
mean the easiest way I can explain it is (90:41 - 90:47)
in order to go to Worlds you would need (90:45 - 90:49)
a set amount of points just for (90:47 - 90:51)
Simplicity sake CU I don&#39;t have the (90:49 - 90:53)
points in front of me let&#39;s just say you (90:51 - 90:55)
needed 100 point points and then you (90:53 - 90:58)
would receive a world invitation and (90:55 - 91:01)
let&#39;s say you win a regionals that gave (90:58 - 91:03)
you like 25 points I know these numbers (91:01 - 91:05)
are not right don&#39;t yell at me in the (91:03 - 91:06)
YouTube I&#39;m just making it simple for (91:05 - 91:08)
people who don&#39;t understand let&#39;s say (91:06 - 91:14)
you win a um a a IC an international (91:08 - 91:16)
maybe that gives you 90 points maybe you (91:14 - 91:18)
win something a little bit lower that (91:16 - 91:20)
gives you 10 points right like you have (91:18 - 91:23)
to win tournaments in order to get (91:20 - 91:26)
points now if you were top 32 instead of (91:23 - 91:28)
getting 25 points maybe you got like 10 (91:26 - 91:30)
points maybe you came in second at an IC (91:28 - 91:32)
so instead of getting 90 points you got (91:30 - 91:37)
60 points so ideally if you performed (91:32 - 91:40)
consistently at all of these events and (91:37 - 91:44)
tournaments you would then earn enough (91:40 - 91:47)
points to then get your invite to Worlds (91:44 - 91:49)
and that&#39;s all you needed you just (91:47 - 91:50)
needed enough points you could go to (91:49 - 91:52)
Worlds you could participate you could (91:50 - 91:55)
play there are some people (91:52 - 91:57)
obviously where if you do I believe win (91:55 - 92:00)
an IC not only do you usually have (91:57 - 92:02)
enough points to go to Worlds but you (92:00 - 92:05)
would also get like a travel voucher as (92:02 - 92:08)
well and so like if you won the (92:05 - 92:11)
championship last year you would also (92:08 - 92:13)
get a travel voucher and guarantee you (92:11 - 92:17)
into the next World slot so as long as (92:13 - 92:18)
you got the (92:17 - 92:23)
points you could go to Worlds this 2025 (92:18 - 92:25)
is saying (92:23 - 92:30)
you have to be one of the top 125 (92:25 - 92:33)
players and if you are number (92:30 - 92:36)
126 you are not going to Worlds you (92:33 - 92:39)
cannot even even if you played your own (92:36 - 92:42)
travel you can&#39;t you you do not have a (92:39 - 92:44)
seat to (92:42 - 92:44)
play sad like I don&#39;t I mean it you know (92:47 - 92:52)
I (92:52 - 92:56)
think well how many people oh I guess we (92:52 - 92:58)
don&#39;t know how many people are going to (92:56 - 93:03)
Worlds like Masters division TCG World (92:58 - 93:06)
Championship 2023 let&#39;s say yokahama uh (93:03 - 93:10)
do you know how many people were in that (93:06 - 93:11)
how many master rank (93:10 - 93:14)
players yeah just going off this since (93:11 - 93:16)
we were just talking about it with so (93:14 - 93:19)
it&#39;s capped at 125 now right well in (93:16 - 93:22)
2025 I don&#39;t (93:19 - 93:28)
know how many people went I I I know for (93:22 - 93:30)
sure it was more than (93:28 - 93:32)
125 right I guess yeah yeah I guess my (93:30 - 93:35)
point is is how many more was this like (93:32 - 93:39)
was it double 250 300 or was it if I was (93:35 - 93:40)
to guess it was probably closer to (93:39 - 93:46)
400 oh wow okay yeah so that&#39;s huge then (93:40 - 93:47)
the because I was I was wondering like (93:46 - 93:48)
how much of a difference does that make (93:47 - 93:51)
to what&#39;s currently happening yeah this (93:48 - 93:53)
is making a big difference yeah that&#39;s (93:51 - 93:56)
huge (93:53 - 93:56)
um people are (93:59 - 94:04)
upset yeah the people the people that (94:01 - 94:06)
are upset are competitive people so it&#39;s (94:04 - 94:07)
not this isn&#39;t like what we talked about (94:06 - 94:10)
earlier with like hardcore Pokemon go (94:07 - 94:12)
players being like (94:10 - 94:14)
Niantic not paying attention I think (94:12 - 94:16)
they are paying attention to the Casual (94:14 - 94:18)
player and the hardcore player but this (94:16 - 94:22)
is this is like you would be vocal about (94:18 - 94:24)
this because you are spending money to (94:22 - 94:26)
go to all these events and getting these (94:24 - 94:28)
points so the the (94:26 - 94:31)
people complaining are the people that (94:28 - 94:32)
this is affecting directly that&#39;s why I (94:31 - 94:34)
try to simplify it in my explanation (94:32 - 94:36)
earlier because if you&#39;ve never gone to (94:34 - 94:39)
a match you might not know what it takes (94:36 - 94:41)
to get a world (94:39 - 94:45)
invite um Heck if the the last three T (94:41 - 94:46)
the last two tournaments weren&#39;t even in (94:45 - 94:48)
the United States one was in London and (94:46 - 94:50)
one was in Japan so like a lot of us (94:48 - 94:52)
people haven&#39;t even had an (94:50 - 94:55)
opportunity to go to a recent world (94:52 - 94:58)
championship and see what that is like I (94:55 - 95:00)
don&#39;t think Hawaii has made that any (94:58 - 95:01)
easier for people but I was going to say (95:00 - 95:05)
it&#39;s not made any easier by being in (95:01 - 95:07)
Hawaii um (95:05 - 95:12)
yeah I so I have I have two things the (95:07 - 95:15)
first is at one point in 2011 during (95:12 - 95:16)
black and (95:15 - 95:19)
white because the Pokemon Trading Card (95:16 - 95:22)
Game and the the VGC stuff and there was (95:19 - 95:24)
no go and there was no (95:22 - 95:26)
Tech poking tournament there was no (95:24 - 95:28)
unite there was just TCG there was just (95:26 - 95:32)
VGC there was a last chance qualifier at (95:28 - 95:36)
Worlds I flew to San Diego in 2011 and I (95:32 - 95:38)
signed up for the last chance (95:36 - 95:40)
qualifier (95:38 - 95:43)
and they had so many people this was (95:40 - 95:46)
before everything like exploded they had (95:43 - 95:48)
so many people at the last chance (95:46 - 95:51)
qualifier that half of the people who (95:48 - 95:55)
registered for TCG got a round one by (95:51 - 95:57)
because they did not have enough seats (95:55 - 96:00)
for them there were 800 people if I (95:57 - 96:01)
remember that signed up for Last Chance (96:00 - 96:04)
qualifier 400 people were told to leave (96:01 - 96:07)
the building they won their first round (96:04 - 96:10)
and to come back for round two because (96:07 - 96:12)
they did not have enough seats and it (96:10 - 96:15)
was it was Swiss so it means if you lost (96:12 - 96:16)
once you were (96:15 - 96:20)
out so they needed just to (96:16 - 96:25)
eliminate 200 people off the bat y (96:20 - 96:27)
and what happens at these tournaments is (96:25 - 96:31)
you set up you know for 600 (96:27 - 96:36)
people and after about two (96:31 - 96:39)
rounds about 300 people are just going (96:36 - 96:41)
to go home like if you lose your first (96:39 - 96:44)
two rounds your likelihood of going any (96:41 - 96:48)
further is slim to (96:44 - 96:51)
none right and for most cases like if (96:48 - 96:53)
you lose three you&#39;re just done there&#39;s (96:51 - 96:56)
there&#39;s no way you can you can keep (96:53 - 97:00)
going uh so you you have you have 600 (96:56 - 97:02)
tables you&#39;re cutting it down to 300 (97:00 - 97:04)
you&#39;re cutting it down to 150 but I (97:02 - 97:08)
think the the initial problem (97:04 - 97:08)
is Pokemon is so (97:08 - 97:15)
big and it&#39;s only gotten bigger in the (97:13 - 97:17)
last which is like a good problem to (97:15 - 97:20)
have it&#39;s only gotten bigger (97:17 - 97:23)
mhm but the scaling of tournaments is (97:20 - 97:25)
really weird and and I don&#39;t know how (97:23 - 97:27)
like chess does it or like League of (97:25 - 97:31)
Legends does it or anything else uh in (97:27 - 97:34)
that sense of scale yeah (97:31 - 97:38)
um but like you need staff and judges (97:34 - 97:41)
for ultimately 600 some (97:38 - 97:43)
people and then when you&#39;re scaling it (97:41 - 97:45)
down you don&#39;t need that many staff and (97:43 - 97:47)
judges But ultimately you have to build (97:45 - 97:50)
a space to accommodate (97:47 - 97:54)
everyone and then and then (97:50 - 97:56)
make it smaller and smaller until you (97:54 - 97:58)
get like a top 32 or a top 16 how many (97:56 - 98:00)
judges are there typically I&#39;ve never (97:58 - 98:02)
actually been to an in-person tournament (98:00 - 98:04)
uh which wild that they&#39;ve had like (98:02 - 98:07)
Worlds at San Diego and I did not attend (98:04 - 98:10)
but uh how many judges are (98:07 - 98:16)
typically there how many judges to (98:10 - 98:19)
TCG games are there usually like is like (98:16 - 98:22)
one judge for 30 games one judge for 10 (98:19 - 98:25)
games like (98:22 - 98:25)
gosh that&#39;s a good (98:26 - 98:29)
question I don&#39;t know how many judges (98:27 - 98:31)
are coming through also a small (98:29 - 98:33)
correction I think like two episodes ago (98:31 - 98:35)
we were talking about stiens uh somebody (98:33 - 98:38)
commented that it wasn&#39;t $100 a day it (98:35 - 98:38)
was (98:38 - 98:41)
$125 stip in for the (98:38 - 98:44)
weekend Oh which is not as good as $100 (98:41 - 98:47)
a day yeah definitely not yeah they they (98:44 - 98:48)
they said at their last tournament they (98:47 - 98:49)
were I can&#39;t remember who that was but (98:48 - 98:52)
thank you for commenting on YouTube an (98:49 - 98:54)
update to the (98:52 - 98:56)
better than nothing yeah better than (98:54 - 99:00)
nothing but still maybe might not cover (98:56 - 99:02)
food yeah for the weekend yeah I still I (99:00 - 99:04)
still think they get they still get a (99:02 - 99:10)
food stien okay oh okay cool yeah (99:04 - 99:10)
um but the the judging isn&#39;t it&#39;s (99:13 - 99:19)
obviously it&#39;s obviously not one to one (99:16 - 99:22)
uh one to one game but it&#39;s got I mean (99:19 - 99:24)
because to your point you have all the (99:22 - 99:28)
judges for 600 people so let&#39;s call 300 (99:24 - 99:31)
games but then very quickly you&#39;re down (99:28 - 99:36)
to you know 32 games or 16 games and (99:31 - 99:38)
then you have all those judges but (99:36 - 99:41)
obviously you don&#39;t need them all unless (99:38 - 99:43)
there&#39;s a very small amount of Judges so (99:41 - 99:47)
it&#39;s like one judge per you know well (99:43 - 99:49)
not well not only judges but you need (99:47 - 99:51)
people to set up and tear down tables (99:49 - 99:55)
you need catering you need uh line Q (99:51 - 99:58)
management like one of the problems at (99:55 - 99:59)
Yokohama that I think we talked about on (99:58 - 100:03)
the show is that competitors were (99:59 - 100:06)
waiting all night the night before the (100:03 - 100:09)
tournament started to pick up their (100:06 - 100:11)
badges like I don&#39;t know maybe if you (100:09 - 100:14)
just flew across the ocean you don&#39;t (100:11 - 100:16)
want to wait in a line for four hours (100:14 - 100:17)
the night before your big tournament (100:16 - 100:20)
when you&#39;re already probably tired or (100:17 - 100:21)
I&#39;m sure some people got there a little (100:20 - 100:22)
bit early but like the point still (100:21 - 100:25)
stands that&#39;s not a great experience no (100:22 - 100:28)
I don&#39;t think this is great don&#39;t get (100:25 - 100:30)
don&#39;t get anything confused here I I (100:28 - 100:34)
don&#39;t think (100:30 - 100:34)
that having making it harder for people (100:34 - 100:42)
to qualify for worlds is is at all not (100:38 - 100:46)
good just it sucks it already like as (100:42 - 100:48)
somebody who did competitive I think (100:46 - 100:50)
maybe some people forget this or maybe (100:48 - 100:51)
some people are newer to the podcast I (100:50 - 100:54)
did competitive TCG for four years (100:51 - 100:56)
and every single weekend it would (100:54 - 100:59)
involve driving two to three hours to a (100:56 - 101:03)
venue playing all day not getting a (100:59 - 101:05)
lunch break like eating a granola bar in (101:03 - 101:06)
the car because you had to get up at (101:05 - 101:10)
like 4:00 a.m. to get there by like 7 (101:06 - 101:12)
leaving that venue at seven or nine (101:10 - 101:16)
driving back if you did make Top Cut (101:12 - 101:18)
you&#39;re not driving back you&#39;re just (101:16 - 101:20)
you&#39;re just there right if if you are (101:18 - 101:22)
not making those drives you are then (101:20 - 101:24)
getting money for a hotel room (101:22 - 101:26)
or you&#39;re getting money for a flight (101:24 - 101:32)
like it was just so time consuming MH (101:26 - 101:34)
and let&#39;s say you wanted to go to all (101:32 - 101:37)
three ic&#39;s got to fly to Orlando you got (101:34 - 101:39)
to fly to I think the new one is in like (101:37 - 101:41)
Brazil and then the other one is in (101:39 - 101:44)
London like that&#39;s expensive to go to (101:41 - 101:47)
three I&#39;s yeah it&#39;s not just C time (101:44 - 101:50)
consuming it is expensive to do all of (101:47 - 101:53)
this on top of if you&#39;re TCG how much it (101:50 - 101:55)
cost actually like play the TCG in (101:53 - 101:57)
itself (101:55 - 101:59)
yeah so you have to you you have to (101:57 - 102:02)
practice you have to you have to pay (101:59 - 102:04)
flights you have to pay hotels you have (102:02 - 102:07)
to travel like the days themselves are (102:04 - 102:10)
long and when you add more players to (102:07 - 102:12)
like a tournament you could add another (102:10 - 102:14)
day right like you could say like well (102:12 - 102:16)
we only have enough seats for 300 people (102:14 - 102:18)
we have 600 people register let&#39;s just (102:16 - 102:23)
have um they actually did this at um (102:18 - 102:24)
before they were called ic&#39;s but when it (102:23 - 102:27)
was in Indiana they had uh they were (102:24 - 102:29)
called Flights you were either in Flight (102:27 - 102:31)
a or you were in Flight B and so you (102:29 - 102:33)
would play enough people in Flight a (102:31 - 102:36)
until it got it down to about 64 people (102:33 - 102:38)
and then the top 64 people of flight a (102:36 - 102:39)
and flight B would then get merged (102:38 - 102:41)
together and then they would start (102:39 - 102:43)
getting eliminated (102:41 - 102:45)
again so you could start doing flights (102:43 - 102:47)
where it&#39;s like all right your flight (102:45 - 102:49)
Thursday and your flight Friday and (102:47 - 102:51)
we&#39;ll figure out at the end of those two (102:49 - 102:53)
days who&#39;s going on to Saturday I think (102:51 - 102:56)
that is a good solution to this but it (102:53 - 102:59)
adds an extra day and that&#39;s an extra (102:56 - 103:00)
day of Staff that&#39;s an extra day of (102:59 - 103:03)
hotels for competitors that&#39;s an extra (103:00 - 103:06)
day for or it&#39;s not an extra day some (103:03 - 103:08)
people would be mad that like I have to (103:06 - 103:09)
play on Thursday so I need to get there (103:08 - 103:11)
on Thursday you get to play on Friday so (103:09 - 103:14)
that&#39;s like one less day for you there (103:11 - 103:16)
are solutions to this but they all (103:14 - 103:18)
involve more money (103:16 - 103:21)
Y and I don&#39;t (103:18 - 103:24)
think throwing more money at it fixes it (103:21 - 103:28)
long term because the tournaments keep (103:24 - 103:31)
getting bigger and bigger it it is weird (103:28 - 103:35)
to think that okay tournament last year (103:31 - 103:37)
let&#39;s say it was 400 right let&#39;s say in (103:35 - 103:39)
the Masters division for TCG (103:37 - 103:41)
specifically you had 400 (103:39 - 103:43)
competitors it is weird to cut it down (103:41 - 103:44)
so (103:43 - 103:47)
much like I understand as things get (103:44 - 103:49)
bigger and bigger you don&#39;t want to have (103:47 - 103:50)
to continue adding on adding on adding (103:49 - 103:53)
on but like you&#39;re doing it at for 400 (103:50 - 103:56)
or 300 now it is weird to cut it back so (103:53 - 104:00)
far when like it is working right now (103:56 - 104:03)
it&#39;s not as if it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s well (104:00 - 104:05)
overgrown and now you&#39;re like well we (104:03 - 104:06)
need to cut it back it&#39;s it seems like (104:05 - 104:08)
they&#39;re future proofing to some extent (104:06 - 104:11)
as things get bigger but it feels like (104:08 - 104:13)
they&#39;re really cutting it back for how (104:11 - 104:16)
many there were in this year maybe last (104:13 - 104:19)
year um to cut it down to like you said (104:16 - 104:24)
like 125 for masters with 125 plus (104:19 - 104:26)
anyone who has won an (104:24 - 104:28)
IC those don&#39;t those people don&#39;t take (104:26 - 104:30)
gu those AR those don&#39;t count right so (104:28 - 104:33)
you&#39;re probably you&#39;re plus (104:30 - 104:37)
like that was 125 us (104:33 - 104:40)
only oh that&#39;s right you were talking (104:37 - 104:44)
okay so it was like 25 U 125 us 75 for (104:40 - 104:47)
Brazil 75 I think 75 Australia so I (104:44 - 104:49)
think you are still getting close to 500 (104:47 - 104:51)
players when you&#39;ve taken all the (104:49 - 104:54)
countries you are okay I wasn&#39;t I was uh (104:51 - 104:55)
when you were saying 400 I was actually (104:54 - 104:57)
thinking about it just from that (104:55 - 104:59)
specific so yeah I don&#39;t think Yokohama (104:57 - 105:01)
was 400 then I think Yokohama was way (104:59 - 105:03)
more than 400 yeah because this is 250 (105:01 - 105:07)
350 this is yeah 380 um 380 plus (105:03 - 105:09)
probably they&#39;re probably expecting (105:07 - 105:14)
around 400 people yeah and I (105:09 - 105:17)
I I guess we&#39;ll find out how many people (105:14 - 105:19)
are going to (105:17 - 105:22)
Hawaii cuz that that would probably be (105:19 - 105:24)
the most amount of people they&#39;ve had (105:22 - 105:27)
qualify and go um they did come out with (105:24 - 105:28)
a (105:27 - 105:31)
tweet uh so they posted the changes on (105:28 - 105:33)
the 27th we&#39;re recording this on the (105:31 - 105:36)
30th and then literally the same day on (105:33 - 105:40)
the 27th at 8:00 p.m. they love tweeting (105:36 - 105:42)
at night thank you everyone for the (105:40 - 105:44)
feedback to the changes implemented in (105:42 - 105:46)
the upcoming 2025 competitive season (105:44 - 105:47)
evolving the competitive structure is an (105:46 - 105:50)
ongoing process we value our community (105:47 - 105:52)
sentiment and suggestions in the (105:50 - 105:54)
meantime please keep in us with your (105:52 - 105:56)
thoughts we look forward to continuing (105:54 - 105:58)
to mature the comp the competitive (105:56 - 106:00)
ecosystem to provide the best player (105:58 - 106:02)
experience for our players fans and (106:00 - 106:04)
Spectators wow same day huh same day (106:02 - 106:06)
they got at least a uh thank you for the (106:04 - 106:08)
feedback keep bringing it on tweet (106:06 - 106:10)
interesting how companies can do that in (106:08 - 106:13)
the same day they can Pro another tweet (106:10 - 106:15)
to let you know they&#39;re he people were (106:13 - 106:18)
angry this tweet very much gave the (106:15 - 106:20)
impression of like we hear you we don&#39;t (106:18 - 106:23)
care (106:20 - 106:23)
yeah this was not the same thing not the (106:24 - 106:28)
same thing as the TCG art (106:25 - 106:30)
competition I was I was comparing it (106:28 - 106:34)
more to n antic no long acknowledge that (106:30 - 106:37)
they know people are mad true um I think (106:34 - 106:40)
there&#39;s a deeper conversation to have uh (106:37 - 106:42)
but we&#39;re already running over uh and I (106:40 - 106:44)
have an appointment so I think we&#39;ll (106:42 - 106:49)
Circle back to this but um it&#39;s it&#39;s it (106:44 - 106:51)
hasn&#39;t even been a week so maybe the (106:49 - 106:52)
next time we record there will be more (106:51 - 106:55)
to this but I think again the overall (106:52 - 106:57)
problem (106:55 - 107:00)
is Pokemon has gotten too big and now (106:57 - 107:02)
they&#39;re trying to figure (107:00 - 107:05)
out how to (107:02 - 107:07)
manage the explosion that they&#39;ve had in (107:05 - 107:09)
the competitive scene which is a good (107:07 - 107:11)
problem to have don&#39;t get me wrong it&#39;s (107:09 - 107:14)
just they need to figure out a system (107:11 - 107:17)
that is fair to everyone especially (107:14 - 107:19)
people who can&#39;t afford to travel every (107:17 - 107:22)
single weekend to qualify for a match so (107:19 - 107:25)
yeah yeah (107:22 - 107:25)
um but (107:25 - 107:28)
anyways we&#39;ll be at go Fest uh we&#39;ll (107:28 - 107:34)
probably be recording an episode on like (107:32 - 107:36)
Wednesday that will come out on Monday (107:34 - 107:38)
so I don&#39;t have to record while I&#39;m new (107:36 - 107:40)
New York so we&#39;ll probably continue this (107:38 - 107:41)
conversation and there&#39;s some other (107:40 - 107:44)
stuff we haven&#39;t covered um so if there (107:41 - 107:45)
is breaking news on like Thursday or (107:44 - 107:47)
Friday just know that the the next (107:45 - 107:49)
episode will be recorded a little early (107:47 - 107:52)
oh hey congrats on Dragon septile (107:49 - 107:54)
finally (107:52 - 107:57)
AR we were (107:54 - 107:59)
right (107:57 - 108:02)
um my next guess would be dark for I (107:59 - 108:04)
would not my next guess I do think for (108:02 - 108:08)
alligator is going to be dark (108:04 - 108:10)
um I don&#39;t know about the other ones (108:08 - 108:12)
though that&#39;s tough I&#39;d have to like (108:10 - 108:14)
really consider like tort (108:12 - 108:19)
Tera I think Infernape would makes sense (108:14 - 108:19)
electric but I don&#39;t have a good (108:19 - 108:23)
justification why I&#39;d have to re it&#39;s (108:21 - 108:26)
move set is in uh has any of them been (108:23 - 108:28)
just the type that they already are i&#39; (108:26 - 108:30)
I&#39;ve asked this before primarina (108:28 - 108:31)
primarina oh right it was fair huh (108:30 - 108:35)
primarina and something else was exactly (108:31 - 108:37)
the type they were I don&#39;t remember the (108:35 - 108:39)
other one well without knowing any of (108:37 - 108:41)
tort tera&#39;s moves or anything I&#39;m just (108:39 - 108:42)
going to go with it just being grass (108:41 - 108:45)
because tort Tera just gives off the The (108:42 - 108:48)
Vi it would just be its (108:45 - 108:51)
