foreign (0:01 - 0:04)
what's up everyone welcome to the (0:23 - 0:29)
551st episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:26 - 0:31)
it's super effective uh I'm your host (0:29 - 0:34)
Steve with me is Hannah (0:31 - 0:38)
hello it's another week (0:34 - 0:40)
I've been trying to get better sleep (0:38 - 0:42)
without Pokemon sleep around and it's (0:40 - 0:44)
not been super successful no Pokemon (0:42 - 0:46)
sleep yet (0:44 - 0:50)
speaking of sleeping Greg is here hi I (0:46 - 0:52)
have been getting sleep that's not (0:50 - 0:55)
surprising that's what I do it's my (0:52 - 0:58)
preferred hobby actually if I could (0:55 - 1:00)
sleep they often sleep or do anything (0:58 - 1:03)
else you know sleep sounds really nice (1:00 - 1:04)
right now (1:03 - 1:07)
uh yeah I we're recording on a Saturday (1:04 - 1:10)
which is usually my day to sleep in but (1:07 - 1:12)
we're here early so I am very excited to (1:10 - 1:15)
go back to sleep after (1:12 - 1:18)
I'm going to the gym to Get Swole do you (1:15 - 1:20)
get tired after the gym like do you nap (1:18 - 1:23)
after gym no I mean I could (1:20 - 1:26)
but I mean I could nap at any time like (1:23 - 1:28)
the question is could you nap the answer (1:26 - 1:32)
is always absolutely 100 yes I could nap (1:28 - 1:37)
at any moment anywhere car plane (1:32 - 1:40)
park bench you name it if you want me to (1:37 - 1:42)
lie down and take a nap I'm in I'm down (1:40 - 1:45)
for any napping you want (1:42 - 1:49)
uh but do I get tired after no I so the (1:45 - 1:50)
weird I don't know (1:49 - 1:53)
I'm like I can tell that my body is (1:50 - 1:56)
tired because I exerted but it's not (1:53 - 1:58)
like (1:56 - 2:00)
this is different than me wanting to (1:58 - 2:03)
sleep yeah it's a physical exhaustion (2:00 - 2:06)
instead of mental exhaustion (2:03 - 2:08)
um so but also I'm one of the people (2:06 - 2:12)
that don't sweat so like the gym is an (2:08 - 2:15)
unusual experience in the fact that like (2:12 - 2:18)
I will be I will look (2:15 - 2:20)
fine but I'm like I can't possibly do (2:18 - 2:22)
another thing if they were like were you (2:20 - 2:24)
at the gym I was like I was there for an (2:22 - 2:25)
hour and a half (2:24 - 2:28)
believe me I can show you my I can show (2:25 - 2:30)
you my Apple watch that says how how (2:28 - 2:34)
fast my heart was beating (2:30 - 2:36)
uh (2:34 - 2:38)
speaking of your hearts racing we have (2:36 - 2:42)
some racing Pokemon news to go over uh (2:38 - 2:45)
no we got some stuff this week yeah (2:42 - 2:49)
we're in that weird lead up to Pokemon (2:45 - 2:51)
day where they don't really want to do a (2:49 - 2:53)
lot because they don't they're like well (2:51 - 2:54)
we can just save it for the end of the (2:53 - 2:58)
month it's like nothing (2:54 - 3:01)
it happens it's just like little hints (2:58 - 3:03)
and tidbits of things like everybody if (3:01 - 3:05)
I get one more person who's like super (3:03 - 3:07)
excited about hearing about the DLCs on (3:05 - 3:10)
Pokemon day I'm like cool that may or (3:07 - 3:11)
may not happen (3:10 - 3:13)
you're not going to get a hint of (3:11 - 3:15)
anything until on Monday (3:13 - 3:17)
somebody asked me the other day they (3:15 - 3:18)
were like (3:17 - 3:20)
what are your expectations for the third (3:18 - 3:22)
legendary and I was like I just hope the (3:20 - 3:25)
third legendary is like (3:22 - 3:27)
frame rate fixes (3:25 - 3:30)
I am this is the new Pokemon frame rate (3:27 - 3:32)
fix like it's so hard to think about (3:30 - 3:36)
like DLC or new content when like (3:32 - 3:40)
I just want what's there to be fixed (3:36 - 3:43)
so is the attorney just the Third (3:40 - 3:47)
official legendary for (3:43 - 3:47)
sure yeah we didn't get any additional (3:47 - 3:52)
legendaries did we yeah we got the (3:50 - 3:55)
horses oh yeah we did horses (3:52 - 3:58)
the horses and the the rabbit that rides (3:55 - 4:02)
the horses yeah the best rabbit (3:58 - 4:04)
um we do have some scarlet and violet (4:02 - 4:07)
news we have uh some TCG news as well (4:04 - 4:08)
but let's start off with the Pokemon Go (4:07 - 4:10)
News (4:08 - 4:12)
um Niantic normally doesn't report this (4:10 - 4:13)
at all (4:12 - 4:16)
for whatever reason uh although like (4:13 - 4:18)
it's weird because like you go to like a (4:16 - 4:20)
wrestling show and they like love to (4:18 - 4:21)
brag about how many people are sitting (4:20 - 4:23)
in seats I'm sure that's also other (4:21 - 4:25)
places where they're like they're we (4:23 - 4:28)
sold out yeah and I think we'll say they (4:25 - 4:29)
sold out but they never say how many (4:28 - 4:31)
tickets they sell (4:29 - 4:35)
it's okay Fox Five the local Vegas news (4:31 - 4:38)
has told us how many tickets they sold (4:35 - 4:42)
uh apparently it was a 50 000 ticketed (4:38 - 4:44)
event (4:42 - 4:47)
um for both days so (4:44 - 4:50)
I I don't know if that's 25 25. (4:47 - 4:53)
absolutely it's it's split immediately (4:50 - 4:55)
in half there's no other questions (4:53 - 4:57)
there's no other way to do it two days (4:55 - 5:00)
chop it and have 25 each day done (4:57 - 5:02)
also don't know how many of those people (5:00 - 5:03)
bought (5:02 - 5:08)
both tickets uh unsure (5:03 - 5:12)
uh but it says uh (5:08 - 5:12)
organizers for the upcoming in-person (5:12 - 5:16)
Pokemon go event says that the Las Vegas (5:14 - 5:17)
Gathering has sold out according to (5:16 - 5:20)
Niantic the Pokemon go Tour event Las (5:17 - 5:21)
Vegas is completely sold out after (5:20 - 5:23)
selling 50 000 tickets the event is for (5:21 - 5:26)
February 18th and February 19th at (5:23 - 5:27)
Sunset Park (5:26 - 5:29)
uh attendees will have a chance to play (5:27 - 5:31)
Pokemon go with thousands of trainers (5:29 - 5:32)
from around the world while catching (5:31 - 5:33)
trading and battling your favorite (5:32 - 5:35)
Pokemon and that is the whole news (5:33 - 5:39)
article Fox 5 must have been a slow week (5:35 - 5:42)
I mean they got to the point and I (5:39 - 5:43)
appreciate that (5:42 - 5:45)
it gave us information we wouldn't have (5:43 - 5:48)
otherwise yeah so it was valuable and (5:45 - 5:51)
they didn't have to sit here and explain (5:48 - 5:53)
what Pokemon go is like thank you for (5:51 - 5:56)
not like people people who click on this (5:53 - 5:59)
article clearly know what this is you do (5:56 - 6:01)
not need to say Pokemon go is a mobile (5:59 - 6:04)
app that launched in 2016. (6:01 - 6:08)
was it 2016. Pokemon go is still in the (6:04 - 6:10)
top 20 most top grossing apps in the App (6:08 - 6:13)
Store (6:10 - 6:13)
um yeah I that seems like a lot of (6:13 - 6:18)
people I don't know how big Sunset Park (6:16 - 6:20)
is uh I've been told it's very big I've (6:18 - 6:22)
been told it's a very good place to play (6:20 - 6:23)
Pokemon go (6:22 - 6:24)
so (6:23 - 6:26)
we'll see I have also told that it's (6:24 - 6:29)
been overrun by homeless people but (6:26 - 6:31)
also where where isn't at this point (6:29 - 6:34)
because of uh the housing issue in the (6:31 - 6:37)
United States who knows and (6:34 - 6:39)
it's warm there (6:37 - 6:41)
it is yeah that's true (6:39 - 6:44)
so like (6:41 - 6:46)
it's a whole lot better than the East (6:44 - 6:48)
Coast where it's I think I saw over a (6:46 - 6:51)
over negative like (6:48 - 6:53)
worse than negative 100 windchill yeah (6:51 - 6:56)
Fahrenheit today yep yep (6:53 - 7:00)
been there done that (6:56 - 7:00)
gray if you were coming to Vegas we (7:01 - 7:04)
could we could have went we could have (7:02 - 7:06)
got married by Elvis (7:04 - 7:09)
we missed you again you need to stop (7:06 - 7:11)
asking me to marry you the answer is no (7:09 - 7:15)
one will remain no unless unless you (7:11 - 7:19)
deal with my husband in some way (7:15 - 7:23)
I'm taken uh I have seen people (7:19 - 7:27)
married by Elvis before and it's not as (7:23 - 7:29)
exciting as you would think (7:27 - 7:33)
I mean I don't know people expect but it (7:29 - 7:35)
is literally a person just dressed as (7:33 - 7:38)
Elvis usually doing the same old thing (7:35 - 7:39)
occasionally doing a bad Elvis (7:38 - 7:42)
impersonation uh and throwing some weird (7:39 - 7:44)
song lyrics in there and ultimately (7:42 - 7:46)
everybody there is drunk because it's (7:44 - 7:48)
Vegas so the chances that you remember (7:46 - 7:50)
it are Slim (7:48 - 7:53)
foreign (7:50 - 7:53)
hey you could play Pickleball (8:01 - 8:05)
there's a Sunset Park pickleball complex (8:03 - 8:07)
at the park (8:05 - 8:10)
oh boy (8:07 - 8:10)
we'll see uh we'll I'll figure it out (8:10 - 8:15)
when I get there we'll I'm sure we'll (8:13 - 8:17)
I'm sure we'll report back on whether (8:15 - 8:19)
this event was worth it or not (8:17 - 8:20)
um (8:20 - 8:23)
down the park (8:20 - 8:26)
a dog park Sunset dog park is attached (8:23 - 8:27)
to Sunset Park this place is kind of big (8:26 - 8:31)
although it's it's starting to seem that (8:27 - 8:35)
the hohengo worldwide tour is going to (8:31 - 8:38)
be a bit disappointing compared to the (8:35 - 8:40)
last two how dare you it's Owen it can't (8:38 - 8:43)
be disappointing in what way (8:40 - 8:46)
well you know the the they haven't (8:43 - 8:49)
really announced a lot right it's just (8:46 - 8:53)
Pokemon will spawn and you will catch (8:49 - 8:57)
the what you know the game that we play (8:53 - 9:00)
Pokemon will spawn and you will catch (8:57 - 9:02)
them there may be some sort of really (9:00 - 9:04)
light not at all interesting storyline (9:02 - 9:07)
to go with it maybe Willow got drowned (9:04 - 9:10)
in a lake and you have to find Groudon (9:07 - 9:13)
to make land to save him it's (9:10 - 9:16)
somebody's going to be maybe in danger (9:13 - 9:18)
Maxi will probably show up and be like (9:16 - 9:20)
don't do that (9:18 - 9:22)
they know something about working (9:20 - 9:25)
together with Team Rocket and also (9:22 - 9:26)
sense (9:25 - 9:30)
late November or December we haven't had (9:26 - 9:32)
any special research (9:30 - 9:35)
in the right side of the research page (9:32 - 9:39)
it's all been timed research (9:35 - 9:39)
and I'm wondering if either the right (9:39 - 9:44)
hand research is going to be big events (9:42 - 9:47)
only or if it's only going to be paid (9:44 - 9:48)
research (9:47 - 9:50)
from now on (9:48 - 9:54)
the the whole thing is free yes there's (9:50 - 9:56)
no ticket and then they said it was like (9:54 - 9:57)
what five dollars for the Masterwork (9:56 - 9:59)
ticket which is (9:57 - 10:02)
probably Shiny Jirachi (9:59 - 10:05)
and whatever else like B level 40 do 30 (10:02 - 10:07)
excellent throws like who knows I don't (10:05 - 10:09)
know what that's going to be (10:07 - 10:10)
people are going to either complain that (10:09 - 10:13)
it's the that it's too short (10:10 - 10:14)
or too long (10:13 - 10:16)
I'm not sure where research is usually (10:14 - 10:18)
pretty good (10:16 - 10:19)
um (10:18 - 10:22)
my assumption is that the worldwide (10:19 - 10:25)
thing will have some sort of work with (10:22 - 10:27)
Team Rocket right they already said that (10:25 - 10:29)
that's going to be a thing but it's I I (10:27 - 10:32)
would assume the unlock is Mega Rayquaza (10:29 - 10:34)
that would be my guess (10:32 - 10:37)
because there is the Rayquaza emerges is (10:34 - 10:41)
in Primal Rumblings which is after (10:37 - 10:44)
the global Hoenn sorry that's after the (10:41 - 10:47)
in-person Hoenn go Fest but a couple (10:44 - 10:49)
days before the global they said the (10:47 - 10:52)
global would be the weekend after (10:49 - 10:55)
um and this event is like super (10:52 - 10:57)
lackluster unless you like braiding (10:55 - 11:00)
because uh your your wild Pokemon are (10:57 - 11:02)
Trico Torchic Mudkip all head (11:00 - 11:05)
communities Whirlpool whisper numbel (11:02 - 11:09)
numeral uh and then barboach and then if (11:05 - 11:11)
you're lucky (11:09 - 11:11)
you may encounter Grovyle Combusken (11:11 - 11:16)
marshtom none can be shiny and then an (11:14 - 11:18)
axle (11:16 - 11:22)
and then it raids one stars are (11:18 - 11:24)
literally just Trico Torchic Mudkip (11:22 - 11:27)
three stars are Grovyle combustion (11:24 - 11:29)
marshtom cannot be shiny not sure why (11:27 - 11:32)
they're here who knows (11:29 - 11:35)
who is doing this is our rename the (11:32 - 11:37)
podcast who is doing three star raids (11:35 - 11:39)
that should be the name of this podcast (11:37 - 11:42)
because who would be doing these (11:39 - 11:44)
I okay and then your five-star rate is (11:42 - 11:46)
Rayquaza which is a big big money maker (11:44 - 11:48)
for Niantic people love (11:46 - 11:50)
the the green snake (11:48 - 11:53)
dragon snake right (11:50 - 11:55)
um there are certain Pokemon that just (11:53 - 11:57)
happened that people just love me too (11:55 - 12:00)
Rayquaza stick them in a raids people (11:57 - 12:02)
will do them uh and then your mega raids (12:00 - 12:04)
will be Latias and Latios and that's the (12:02 - 12:08)
whole event it's really not good it's (12:04 - 12:10)
just it (12:08 - 12:12)
yeah I have no idea why they're doing (12:10 - 12:16)
that event oh (12:12 - 12:16)
um the Rayquaza raids are exciting it (12:16 - 12:20)
may be that (12:19 - 12:22)
the starters will be harder to get (12:20 - 12:24)
during the actual (12:22 - 12:27)
Hoenn tour that they will be spawning (12:24 - 12:29)
less often because the the highlight of (12:27 - 12:31)
the tour events is that you're going to (12:29 - 12:33)
be able to catch every single Pokemon (12:31 - 12:34)
from that generation (12:33 - 12:36)
so maybe they just want to make sure (12:34 - 12:38)
that people can get the starters (12:36 - 12:41)
yeah I mean that would be nice maybe I (12:38 - 12:42)
think they're trying to come up with a (12:41 - 12:44)
reason (12:42 - 12:48)
but keep doing PR for them keep writing (12:44 - 12:51)
these reasons romantic (12:48 - 12:51)
um (12:51 - 12:54)
a more exciting event (12:52 - 12:58)
uh is also at Pokemon go live.com charm (12:54 - 13:00)
is in the air celebrate Pokemon Go's (12:58 - 13:03)
Valentine's event with a limited love (13:00 - 13:05)
disc research day (13:03 - 13:08)
mega Gardevoir makes its debut which is (13:05 - 13:09)
great we only have one fairy Mega in the (13:08 - 13:11)
game right now it's altario so this is (13:09 - 13:13)
the second fairy Mega (13:11 - 13:15)
um (13:13 - 13:17)
there will be time to research lovely (13:15 - 13:20)
wishes trainers will be able to access a (13:17 - 13:23)
branching time research to Grant uh (13:20 - 13:26)
their wish of a bonus for extra XP or (13:23 - 13:30)
extra candy during the daily Adventure (13:26 - 13:33)
sync you can either choose uh (13:30 - 13:35)
no matter which you choose trainers who (13:33 - 13:37)
complete the research will receive items (13:35 - 13:39)
and an encounter for furlish are they (13:37 - 13:41)
saying that one is the blue furlish and (13:39 - 13:43)
one is the pink (13:41 - 13:46)
I'm saying it but that's it's slightly (13:43 - 13:49)
implied but not really I it's it is (13:46 - 13:51)
written in such a way that it's like (13:49 - 13:53)
well it could be one path gives you blue (13:51 - 13:56)
one path gives you pink or they just put (13:53 - 13:57)
both of them on there and you get a (13:56 - 13:59)
random chance of getting either they (13:57 - 14:02)
don't clarify because why why would they (13:59 - 14:04)
why I mean (14:02 - 14:05)
foreign (14:04 - 14:07)
the global Valentine's Day Challenge (14:05 - 14:11)
will be from the 7th to the 14th (14:07 - 14:13)
and celebration you can work with other (14:11 - 14:15)
trainers around the world by sending (14:13 - 14:17)
gifts if trainers send enough gifts they (14:15 - 14:18)
will unlock bonuses for all trainers for (14:17 - 14:20)
the remainder of the event (14:18 - 14:22)
first Global bonus would be three times (14:20 - 14:27)
the transfer candy that's a good one uh (14:22 - 14:29)
second one is two times the transfer XL (14:27 - 14:32)
candy if you're level 31 and above and (14:29 - 14:35)
then the global the the actual challenge (14:32 - 14:38)
is to send 100 million gifts (14:35 - 14:42)
oh these are really good bonuses yeah I (14:38 - 14:44)
mean I don't there's a lot of people (14:42 - 14:45)
that play this game right (14:44 - 14:49)
if one million people send 10 gifts it's (14:45 - 14:51)
done (14:49 - 14:54)
no yes no no uh (14:51 - 14:57)
10 million people would have to send 10 (14:54 - 14:59)
gifts 10 gifts there you go there we got (14:57 - 15:02)
there welcome to mathcast yeah it's (14:59 - 15:04)
called adding zeros but who are doing (15:02 - 15:06)
the three-star race (15:04 - 15:08)
but nobody does three star raids look (15:06 - 15:10)
again I this is one of those marketing (15:08 - 15:13)
things where you'll be shocked if (15:10 - 15:16)
somehow people failed it because no (15:13 - 15:18)
matter what they could say we hit our (15:16 - 15:20)
goal they stated the goal and if that's (15:18 - 15:22)
true or not everything's wow so many (15:20 - 15:23)
people play their game and so many (15:22 - 15:25)
things are happening (15:23 - 15:29)
I would I would be shocked if we didn't (15:25 - 15:33)
hit the goal yeah (15:29 - 15:33)
there was very very very very very early (15:33 - 15:37)
on (15:35 - 15:39)
right when they were new at marketing (15:37 - 15:41)
I think there was one but they're like (15:39 - 15:44)
hey we didn't do it so we lowered we (15:41 - 15:48)
lowered it yeah I think I remember that (15:44 - 15:50)
I remember like one goal we didn't hit (15:48 - 15:54)
but I remember what it was was it it was (15:50 - 15:56)
like a africanto tour but before Johto (15:54 - 15:57)
or something I don't know I don't (15:56 - 15:59)
remember uh there were ones that they (15:57 - 16:01)
did in the actual in was it Sergeant (15:59 - 16:03)
Shield that they had at the very (16:01 - 16:04)
beginning (16:03 - 16:06)
no you're thinking of Sun and Moon Sun (16:04 - 16:10)
and Moon yes you failed a lot inside of (16:06 - 16:11)
it they did not understand the marketing (16:10 - 16:13)
for Sun and Moon that you let everybody (16:11 - 16:15)
succeed and create the atmosphere that (16:13 - 16:16)
you have a super popular game well (16:15 - 16:18)
what's what's what was weird about that (16:16 - 16:20)
is you had to like (16:18 - 16:23)
connect inside like Festival Plaza and (16:20 - 16:26)
then report your data yeah and now we (16:23 - 16:27)
have a game that as soon as you connect (16:26 - 16:29)
to the internet it will like read your (16:27 - 16:32)
data but no goals for this game (16:29 - 16:35)
uh they just took away a frame rate yeah (16:32 - 16:37)
I mean the goal is if we hit a hundred (16:35 - 16:40)
thousand people we'll we'll improve the (16:37 - 16:42)
frame rate we'll give you a couple (16:40 - 16:45)
frames back (16:42 - 16:46)
um or you know you'll just get stuck in (16:45 - 16:48)
a raid and then you won't be able to (16:46 - 16:50)
press anything for the remaining of (16:48 - 16:52)
five minutes it's only five minutes of (16:50 - 16:55)
your life as you watch things tick down (16:52 - 16:57)
helplessly sitting there it's it's like (16:55 - 17:00)
waiting for Godot (16:57 - 17:02)
I I Now understand why Greninja didn't (17:00 - 17:04)
have water sugar cane because I battled (17:02 - 17:07)
a braillum that had bullet seed and holy (17:04 - 17:11)
cow it waste the timer I think 50 of (17:07 - 17:12)
that match was watching bullet seed (17:11 - 17:14)
happen and I was like this is unbearable (17:12 - 17:16)
right now like we we literally are (17:14 - 17:19)
waiting so long for our turn 50 proceed (17:17 - 17:23)
50 stuck in a healing menu That's (17:19 - 17:26)
scarlet and violet that's the red (17:23 - 17:30)
uh for through uh you'll be able to (17:26 - 17:32)
change for a fruit to the Valentine the (17:30 - 17:36)
heart trim for fruit uh and and this is (17:32 - 17:37)
the first time you can do that trim (17:36 - 17:39)
after furfu has become shiny available (17:37 - 17:41)
so this is where people will be getting (17:39 - 17:44)
the shiny heart trim ferfers for the (17:41 - 17:47)
first time that is 25 candy and 10 000 (17:44 - 17:49)
Stardust (17:47 - 17:51)
and then I think the wild encounters are (17:49 - 17:53)
significantly better here for the this (17:51 - 17:55)
event than the (17:53 - 18:00)
Primal rumbles or whatever so you have a (17:55 - 18:02)
niantic's really on a Nidoran kick I'll (18:00 - 18:03)
tell you that much (18:02 - 18:07)
Iran uh hope our three-star raids have (18:03 - 18:10)
Nido Queen Nido King uh Skitty uh (18:07 - 18:14)
Volbeat and illumise so these are um (18:10 - 18:16)
these are all the infamous Pokemon (18:14 - 18:20)
couples nidorans the beats the the bus (18:16 - 18:24)
their favorite costumes couple waylord (18:20 - 18:28)
he's not featured yeah really big missed (18:24 - 18:29)
opportunity here that Whaler does not (18:28 - 18:33)
feature kitties alone unfortunately (18:29 - 18:36)
uh Woobat frillish (18:33 - 18:39)
um flabebees which they've kind of been (18:36 - 18:41)
missing out of the pool for a while or (18:39 - 18:42)
if they are in the pool there I haven't (18:41 - 18:44)
seen one (18:42 - 18:46)
uh (18:44 - 18:50)
and more LOL that some trainers may get (18:46 - 18:52)
uh a Chansey on Audino and alola mola (18:50 - 18:55)
and then the other flabebe (18:52 - 18:57)
and then your eggs will be Lickitung (18:55 - 19:01)
Smoochum Happiny frillish frillish alola (18:57 - 19:03)
Mola (19:01 - 19:07)
and of course our raids here we have a (19:03 - 19:10)
Chancey Shinx for fruit and esper we (19:07 - 19:12)
haven't seen esperan raids in a while so (19:10 - 19:14)
he's back (19:12 - 19:17)
um is that worth a dollar (19:14 - 19:17)
not really no I mean he's not spawning (19:18 - 19:24)
he hasn't spawned ever in a while he's (19:23 - 19:27)
always been raided (19:24 - 19:30)
if you really like it it can be shiny (19:27 - 19:32)
and you know what is worth a dollar Greg (19:30 - 19:36)
your three star raids (19:32 - 19:36)
okay (19:36 - 19:41)
get enough (19:37 - 19:44)
uh Lickitung which makes sense because I (19:41 - 19:45)
think Lickitung is really good in GBL (19:44 - 19:49)
also can be shiny uh miltank (19:45 - 19:51)
can be shiny Gallade (19:49 - 19:54)
cannot be shiny no nor can need a queen (19:51 - 19:56)
noodle king (19:54 - 19:57)

hard pattern which could be shiny (20:09 - 20:13)

more LOL and then they will add a (20:15 - 20:20)
frillish top and frillish glasses to the (20:17 - 20:23)
store they're okay they give very like (20:20 - 20:25)
big Trans Energy that's yeah that's the (20:23 - 20:27)
only thing they got going for them (20:25 - 20:30)
weird (20:27 - 20:30)
eyeball eyelash (20:31 - 20:39)
logo running is just (20:35 - 20:41)
no bueno (20:39 - 20:44)
I mean it's okay if you don't know that (20:41 - 20:48)
it's eyeballs yeah I guess they look (20:44 - 20:50)
like cues to me (20:48 - 20:53)
I mean what does the other one looks (20:50 - 20:54)
like a gear that doesn't know where it's (20:53 - 20:56)
going because it's upside down (20:54 - 20:59)
uh there's a there's a love disc limited (20:56 - 21:02)
research day on Saturday February 11th (20:59 - 21:06)
I'm excited for that one so uh you uh (21:02 - 21:09)
spin discs you get (21:06 - 21:12)
a tasks to complete it is (21:09 - 21:16)
I will be technically in the best place (21:12 - 21:18)
to play this game on that day for that (21:16 - 21:20)
research do you have a shiny love disc (21:18 - 21:23)
no well it's your anniversary Greg (21:20 - 21:25)
you're in Disney it's your anniversary (21:23 - 21:27)
you could get a shiny heart and you (21:25 - 21:29)
could trade it to your husband who (21:27 - 21:31)
doesn't play the game who will look at (21:29 - 21:32)
it and go what is this trash and I'll (21:31 - 21:35)
say exactly you can take a picture with (21:32 - 21:39)
it you can take a picture with it (21:35 - 21:40)
oh (21:39 - 21:43)
I'm sure the I'm sure the mouse will (21:40 - 21:45)
love to take a picture of you your (21:43 - 21:46)
husband (21:45 - 21:50)
that'll be uh 200 please for me to (21:46 - 21:52)
release your phone with this picture on (21:50 - 21:55)
it okay thanks (21:52 - 21:55)
um yeah I I I think it's very jarring (21:55 - 22:01)
here we have one great event and we have (21:59 - 22:03)
one bad event (22:01 - 22:05)
I think the Valentine's Day event seems (22:03 - 22:09)
good a lot of options good rewards brand (22:05 - 22:11)
new shiny of frillish (22:09 - 22:13)
I have some really good returning (22:11 - 22:17)
Pokemon and the Primal Rumblings is do (22:13 - 22:20)
you like starters because we got them (22:17 - 22:22)
well we also got Rayquaza if you like um (22:20 - 22:26)
if you hate money we got requests I mean (22:22 - 22:27)
there's a lot of people Bobby who hate (22:26 - 22:30)
money (22:27 - 22:32)
uh Bobby has to have like three or four (22:30 - 22:35)
Shiny Rayquaza right at this point we (22:32 - 22:37)
thought that about the reggies and we (22:35 - 22:39)
know that that's not true (22:37 - 22:42)
we don't Bobby doesn't Bobby does a lot (22:39 - 22:44)
of things that he gave secrets so that (22:42 - 22:46)
he's not actively shamed for it and I (22:44 - 22:49)
think Bobby needs to come forth on the (22:46 - 22:50)
internet and admit all of his personal (22:49 - 22:53)
shames and tell us how many Shiny (22:50 - 22:56)
Rayquaza he has and if none (22:53 - 22:59)
contractually obligated to spend every (22:56 - 23:00)
last bit of a savings trying to catch (22:59 - 23:01)
one (23:00 - 23:03)
the Rayquaza raid day one time wasn't (23:01 - 23:05)
there because I felt like (23:03 - 23:06)
probably (23:05 - 23:08)
I felt like I walked from raid to raid (23:06 - 23:12)
and did replays after Rayquaza (23:08 - 23:14)
I think there was probably that seems (23:12 - 23:17)
like something they would have died (23:14 - 23:19)
chances chances are they milked that (23:17 - 23:22)
yeah I haven't done sure I haven't (23:19 - 23:24)
I don't think I have (23:22 - 23:27)
invested in trying to get a shiny (23:24 - 23:29)
legendary specifically in a very long (23:27 - 23:30)
time so I just don't pay attention to (23:29 - 23:33)
those raid days very much anymore (23:30 - 23:36)
because it's it's just money (23:33 - 23:39)
and I'm not usually willing to spend (23:36 - 23:42)
that much money to try and get a Shiny (23:39 - 23:44)
Rayquaza (23:42 - 23:48)
it's just money uh-huh (23:44 - 23:50)
that's all those events are (23:48 - 23:52)
I mean I have a whole ton of um (23:50 - 23:56)
The non-remote Raid passes so if there (23:52 - 23:57)
is a time I could get together in person (23:56 - 24:00)
with people to do a red day that is a (23:57 - 24:01)
good experience (24:00 - 24:03)
but when it is remote raid passes when (24:01 - 24:05)
all of the friends you are playing (24:03 - 24:08)
Pokemon go with are far away and the (24:05 - 24:10)
ones who are in person have no interest (24:08 - 24:13)
in the raids (24:10 - 24:13)
there is not really an event I want to (24:13 - 24:18)
do (24:16 - 24:19)
but (24:18 - 24:21)
Rayquaza's back (24:19 - 24:23)
and I'm (24:21 - 24:25)
I'm sure they will continue to milk it (24:23 - 24:27)
before the mega (24:25 - 24:29)
well I I saw that people are like I'm (24:27 - 24:31)
surprised that they didn't give Rayquaza (24:29 - 24:33)
Drake in a cent like why are you (24:31 - 24:34)
surprised it's not Mega yet they would (24:33 - 24:37)
save dragons (24:34 - 24:37)
to milk to milk it more I don't I I (24:37 - 24:43)
would assume those players just never (24:41 - 24:46)
played like auras they just don't know (24:43 - 24:49)
that like the gimmick about Rayquaza is (24:46 - 24:51)
it doesn't need a mega stone it just (24:49 - 24:54)
needs to use Dragon Ascent to Mega (24:51 - 24:56)
Evolve that's the whole (24:54 - 24:57)
gimmick (24:56 - 25:00)
but yeah it was like breaking swipe why (24:57 - 25:03)
not Dragon ascent (25:00 - 25:04)
because they're not done niantic's not (25:03 - 25:07)
done nothing (25:04 - 25:07)
there should be some lean years coming (25:07 - 25:11)
up and they need to they need to fill it (25:09 - 25:13)
with something (25:11 - 25:15)
um before before we go to break uh give (25:13 - 25:19)
me a Greg give me your comfy update (25:15 - 25:21)
um okay well (25:19 - 25:25)
what do you ask about your night uh it (25:21 - 25:31)
was severely nerfed uh from test to from (25:25 - 25:34)
the open what the time from the test (25:31 - 25:37)
servers to reality (25:34 - 25:38)
um there's a lot of people who consider (25:37 - 25:41)
it dead weight uh simply because the (25:38 - 25:43)
healing that it provides (25:41 - 25:47)
is so much worse than how they fix a lot (25:43 - 25:50)
of the other healers particularly uh (25:47 - 25:52)
clef label right now (25:50 - 25:55)
um it was a Healer and uh yeah it does (25:52 - 25:57)
some it does Moonlight healing and they (25:55 - 25:58)
bumped Moonlight heating healing quite a (25:57 - 26:03)
bit uh like quite a bit uh (25:58 - 26:05)
I will say if people are really like (26:03 - 26:06)
there are a lot of people who are really (26:05 - 26:10)
good uh with (26:06 - 26:10)
who can make it work really well but (26:11 - 26:19)
yeah just watching it in random solo (26:16 - 26:24)
play it bad it's it really requires I (26:19 - 26:26)
think it really requires you to attach (26:24 - 26:29)
to somebody who knows what they're doing (26:26 - 26:32)
um and if they have a person that just (26:29 - 26:35)
doesn't have any clue (26:32 - 26:37)
what they're doing in any way shape or (26:35 - 26:39)
form like you're just you're attaching (26:37 - 26:41)
just to a bad player and you're gonna (26:39 - 26:44)
have a bad experience and the healing (26:41 - 26:46)
that it's providing the things that it (26:44 - 26:50)
does aren't up to par with other (26:46 - 26:51)
choices (26:50 - 26:54)
and this is really for solo queuing (26:51 - 26:56)
which is what most people do (26:54 - 26:58)
um if it attaches to stable why does it (26:56 - 27:01)
turn invisible it does oh okay so if (26:58 - 27:02)
attached to Sable line table light goes (27:01 - 27:05)
invisible it also goes invisible (27:02 - 27:08)
um when it's on a Pokemon or can it only (27:05 - 27:11)
heal it it can attack it has attacks uh (27:08 - 27:14)
but they're probably like closer range (27:11 - 27:17)
yeah closer rates are also some of the (27:14 - 27:20)
attacks are directional (27:17 - 27:22)
so the problem with some of the like (27:20 - 27:24)
grass nuts directional the problem is if (27:22 - 27:27)
you're attached somebody doing uh a (27:24 - 27:28)
grass nut and that player turns because (27:27 - 27:32)
you have no control it turns your aim (27:28 - 27:35)
so there's some problems with people (27:32 - 27:37)
like you just can't aim lighting lining (27:35 - 27:38)
up a shot and then the person that (27:37 - 27:40)
they're running their attached to runs (27:38 - 27:43)
off and it switches and they move so (27:40 - 27:45)
like grass nuts the not that's option (27:43 - 27:47)
people are going with magical Leaf they (27:45 - 27:48)
are (27:47 - 27:52)
um the the healing is based off of how (27:48 - 27:54)
many flowers it has attached to itself (27:52 - 27:57)
currently which it gets through going (27:54 - 27:59)
into tall grass (27:57 - 28:02)
so one of the things people are doing is (27:59 - 28:04)
they'll attach they'll detach to pop (28:02 - 28:07)
into tall grass get a get a boosted (28:04 - 28:09)
attack off and then jump back on and the (28:07 - 28:10)
people who are doing really good with it (28:09 - 28:12)
are good at doing that juggle where they (28:10 - 28:16)
jumps off do a boosted attack jump back (28:12 - 28:18)
on they have a lot of healing at that (28:16 - 28:21)
point in heal it's a lot of juggling (28:18 - 28:24)
um the unite move is really weird (28:21 - 28:28)
in that it creates a big (28:24 - 28:31)
spot of tall grass and anybody who's in (28:28 - 28:32)
it (28:31 - 28:34)
is hidden (28:32 - 28:36)
and the patch is big enough (28:34 - 28:42)
to also hide Rayquaza at the end so (28:36 - 28:42)
but everybody knows Rayquaza is in there (28:42 - 28:49)
so nobody's that 100 sure like what is (28:46 - 28:52)
that doing (28:49 - 28:55)
it would hide its Health right it hides (28:52 - 28:56)
its health (28:55 - 29:00)
but not for a tremendously long time (28:56 - 29:03)
it it it is an unusual Pokemon I think (29:00 - 29:05)
generally across the board everybody (29:03 - 29:07)
agrees that it was nerfed into the (29:05 - 29:10)
ground and it was nerfed too far it (29:07 - 29:13)
definitely needs to be brought up (29:10 - 29:16)
to at least be considered a better (29:13 - 29:19)
Contender than it is right now that said (29:16 - 29:21)
people who are good with it who are good (29:19 - 29:23)
at the bouncing on and off who are fine (29:21 - 29:26)
with only taking very only two moves (29:23 - 29:27)
really work which is floral healing and (29:26 - 29:30)
magical Leaf because it's really too (29:27 - 29:32)
hard to use the other ones (29:30 - 29:34)
um are having are having a good time (29:32 - 29:36)
with it I will say generally when a (29:34 - 29:38)
thing comes out you'll see a lot of it (29:36 - 29:40)
I've been I've played a number of (29:38 - 29:43)
matches and I only ran into it once (29:40 - 29:45)
um pretty much like most of the top (29:43 - 29:49)
players are like it's (29:45 - 29:49)
given the other healers in the game it (29:49 - 29:55)
is not an optimal pick right now okay if (29:51 - 29:57)
you like it and you can get good with it (29:55 - 29:59)
yeah you you can do a lot does it have a (29:57 - 30:02)
car does it have like an outfit already (29:59 - 30:05)
not that I saw hmm that's a bummer well (30:02 - 30:07)
no deal then I'm only there for the (30:05 - 30:09)
outfits I'm only there for the punk rock (30:07 - 30:11)
a zoomero yeah I don't know how you're (30:09 - 30:15)
gonna put an outfit on comfy (30:11 - 30:15)
because it's like very it's small it's (30:15 - 30:21)
tiny and most of the time you can't see (30:18 - 30:23)
it what's interesting is you can tell (30:21 - 30:25)
which Pokemon is attached to because it (30:23 - 30:28)
gets their nameplate gets a floral (30:25 - 30:31)
flourish on it it's like Oh Come phase (30:28 - 30:33)
on that one and you can kind of see it (30:31 - 30:36)
it's hard to see when it's attached to (30:33 - 30:38)
somebody off you can't Target it so it (30:36 - 30:39)
doesn't matter the other thing about (30:38 - 30:41)
comfae is (30:39 - 30:44)
you can't score while you're attached (30:41 - 30:47)
that makes sense so you have to detach (30:44 - 30:50)
to score wait if you're on like a (30:47 - 30:53)
Tyranitar and the Tyranitar dies do you (30:50 - 30:56)
die no you pop off immediately oh okay (30:53 - 30:59)
and then since you have no health and (30:56 - 31:01)
generally whatever just killed a (30:59 - 31:03)
Tyranitar which is somebody really (31:01 - 31:06)
fighting hard you are you are up the (31:03 - 31:08)
creek people (31:06 - 31:10)
um (31:08 - 31:12)
generally I've seen them they hold off (31:10 - 31:14)
they do a lot in team fights where (31:12 - 31:15)
they'll (31:14 - 31:17)
attaches to somebody when that's done (31:15 - 31:19)
immediately jump to somebody else (31:17 - 31:22)
because they know they're squishy (31:19 - 31:24)
um so unless you're that's something (31:22 - 31:26)
that you know has good survival I've (31:24 - 31:29)
seen a lot more people attaching only in (31:26 - 31:33)
group settings but still (31:29 - 31:35)
the other thing they did is you in order (31:33 - 31:36)
to complain to be really really good at (31:35 - 31:40)
healing you have to get to level 10. (31:36 - 31:43)
um as that means you're relying on XP (31:40 - 31:45)
share which is now a much better item (31:43 - 31:47)
but also (31:45 - 31:50)
like attaching to an attacker or (31:47 - 31:53)
somebody who is sharing those kills with (31:50 - 31:56)
you to get up that high it's not it's (31:53 - 31:57)
not as (31:56 - 31:59)
good at lower levels so they probably (31:57 - 32:02)
also need to fix that to make it more (31:59 - 32:05)
viable (32:02 - 32:05)
crameran's still bad (32:05 - 32:08)
no (32:07 - 32:11)
no it's fine (32:08 - 32:11)
um (32:11 - 32:13)
they're still it's it's definitely not (32:11 - 32:15)
the top tier that it was because they (32:13 - 32:19)
did the emblem uh switch around yeah but (32:15 - 32:21)
and it's and it's ultimate got well (32:19 - 32:23)
everyone's ultimate got weird yeah (32:21 - 32:24)
everyone's ultimates got weird it's (32:23 - 32:27)
ultimate got partic like now the fact (32:24 - 32:29)
that you can kill commemorate pretty (32:27 - 32:33)
easy in the middle of its ultimate uh (32:29 - 32:35)
hurts cramerant a lot before it was (32:33 - 32:37)
really hard to get in to kill Kramer now (32:35 - 32:39)
it's not as hard to get to cramerant and (32:37 - 32:42)
cram rat does not have a lot of life (32:39 - 32:45)
um so like generally it used to be that (32:42 - 32:48)
you would just run out right like you (32:45 - 32:49)
just run out of the thing and now you (32:48 - 32:52)
generally see attackers run in because (32:49 - 32:54)
like I'm just gonna end this (32:52 - 32:56)
especially since most primary players (32:54 - 32:58)
ultimate when they're already at half (32:56 - 33:01)
health so you're like (32:58 - 33:03)
I can get I can get through that shield (33:01 - 33:05)
and get that cram right down without (33:03 - 33:08)
taking enough damage to kill me (33:05 - 33:11)
um particularly susceptible to (33:08 - 33:12)
uh (33:11 - 33:14)
uh the Larvitar line Tyranitar transitar (33:12 - 33:15)
is just (33:14 - 33:17)
it gets stronger the more at least (33:15 - 33:21)
Health it has which is bad so you can (33:17 - 33:22)
see tyranitars charge in terms of crime (33:21 - 33:24)
rate in the ultimate like kill it kill (33:22 - 33:27)
it kill it kill it I'll be in here (33:24 - 33:30)

applied in Pokemon TCG online (35:12 - 35:19)
um so there's a lot here (35:16 - 35:21)
um number one let's get the elephant out (35:19 - 35:23)
of the room uh (35:21 - 35:27)
tcgl is bad it's not good it's it's (35:23 - 35:29)
still in beta for a reason (35:27 - 35:33)
it's it's not ready uh for I want to (35:29 - 35:34)
remind people that this game was (35:33 - 35:36)
supposed to come out (35:34 - 35:38)
they they said October of whatever (35:36 - 35:40)
around the time brilliant Diamond (35:38 - 35:41)
shining Pro was supposed to come out I (35:40 - 35:44)
believe and then they delayed it (35:41 - 35:48)
and then did we just live in this beta (35:44 - 35:52)
now uh where it's not great (35:48 - 35:54)
um the Pokemon company invited me and a (35:52 - 35:56)
couple other people that have like a (35:54 - 35:57)
preview for this when they were getting (35:56 - 35:58)
ready to launch it and I was like yeah (35:57 - 36:00)
this seems fine and then (35:58 - 36:02)
they got delayed (36:00 - 36:04)
um (36:02 - 36:08)
they also did say that you can you can (36:04 - 36:10)
do this now right this this has been (36:08 - 36:11)
available since it's been in beta you (36:10 - 36:15)
can migrate your PTC Geo account to ptcg (36:11 - 36:19)
live for PTC Gila yeah live (36:15 - 36:21)
um it's a one-way trip though so once (36:19 - 36:25)
you take your account from uh o to l (36:21 - 36:27)
uh you can't go back (36:25 - 36:30)
but they also said once (36:27 - 36:34)
live is out of beta (36:30 - 36:35)
then (36:34 - 36:39)
online would shut down permanently (36:35 - 36:41)
this could be a Gmail situation where in (36:39 - 36:43)
beta for the next (36:41 - 36:46)
five to ten years who knows (36:43 - 36:47)
um but you'll need to move your (36:46 - 36:50)
collection eventually (36:47 - 36:50)
but no one wants to move their (36:51 - 36:55)
collection because live is not good but (36:52 - 36:57)
also you're they're almost forcing your (36:55 - 36:59)
hand at this point because if you play (36:57 - 37:02)
standard (36:59 - 37:05)
it's done like Crown Zenith will come (37:02 - 37:08)
out and then the sword and Scarlet and (37:05 - 37:10)
violet sets will also follow very (37:08 - 37:14)
shortly and that is the new format (37:10 - 37:15)
um (37:14 - 37:17)
and also (37:15 - 37:22)
again some details here uh online has (37:17 - 37:25)
a trading post where you could trade you (37:22 - 37:28)
know your Charizard EX for your zero or (37:25 - 37:30)
ex or you could trade 18 booster packs (37:28 - 37:33)
for one Cynthia full art (37:30 - 37:35)
um live does not have trading that's (37:33 - 37:40)
both good and bad the trading Market was (37:35 - 37:42)
the wild west it was it was very (37:40 - 37:44)
intimidating to new players it was very (37:42 - 37:46)
hard to navigate it was very hard to (37:44 - 37:48)
tell whether or not what you were (37:46 - 37:51)
trading was good or not or bad or like (37:48 - 37:53)
how many packs is this worth or like oh (37:51 - 37:54)
you opened the pack you should have kept (37:53 - 37:55)
the pack seals because the pack was (37:54 - 37:58)
worth more when it was not open (37:55 - 38:02)
on the flip side live has it where (37:58 - 38:04)
um you can only get four of every card (38:02 - 38:06)
and then other cards would turn into (38:04 - 38:08)
like some sort of dust like Hearthstone (38:06 - 38:09)
and you can use that dust to buy other (38:08 - 38:11)
cards so (38:09 - 38:14)
um better in some instances worse in (38:11 - 38:16)
some instances neither neither is like a (38:14 - 38:18)
perfect system (38:16 - 38:19)
um (38:18 - 38:21)
but (38:19 - 38:21)
we're talking about people are talking (38:22 - 38:26)
about how live is just not great it's (38:23 - 38:27)
not (38:26 - 38:31)
amazing and (38:27 - 38:31)
ptcgo will still work but it's almost (38:32 - 38:39)
like what's the point if (38:35 - 38:41)
you know I feel like if if you're if (38:39 - 38:44)
you're logging in every day (38:41 - 38:46)
you're the person that they're forcing (38:44 - 38:48)
to make the move (38:46 - 38:48)
because who's logging every day and (38:49 - 38:53)
being like I'm not that excited for the (38:51 - 38:55)
Scarlet (38:53 - 38:55)
t (38:56 - 38:58)
it's just a poor transition (39:00 - 39:06)
I also think there's a little (39:03 - 39:08)
um (39:06 - 39:08)
I don't know I don't know how to word (39:09 - 39:14)
this like there's like some bad faith (39:11 - 39:15)
here (39:14 - 39:19)
or some some maybe we're like getting (39:15 - 39:22)
gas lit because they they say here (39:19 - 39:24)
that they need to they want to put all (39:22 - 39:27)
the resources into live (39:24 - 39:30)
but they're two different developers I (39:27 - 39:31)
understand that there's probably (39:30 - 39:33)
somebody there talking and being like (39:31 - 39:35)
all right we need to update this but (39:33 - 39:36)
like (39:35 - 39:39)
direwolf digital (39:36 - 39:42)
did they know this is coming like I I'm (39:39 - 39:44)
gonna say when they say put put all our (39:42 - 39:46)
resources they mean we're stopping (39:44 - 39:49)
paying the one person and we're taking (39:46 - 39:51)
the money we were paying them and paying (39:49 - 39:52)
that to these other people to make them (39:51 - 39:55)
work out the bugs we needed to put the (39:52 - 39:59)
resources AKA our paychecks somewhere (39:55 - 40:03)
else which is I'm sure dire look the (39:59 - 40:04)
chances that direwolf has been getting (40:03 - 40:06)
any sort of money other than a trickle (40:04 - 40:08)
to pay for licensing (40:06 - 40:10)
for the product that they haven't been (40:08 - 40:14)
able to update in 500 years uh yeah I'm (40:10 - 40:15)
pretty sure they knew this was coming (40:14 - 40:18)
this is probably the end of the contract (40:15 - 40:19)
that they had with them and they're like (40:18 - 40:21)
okay well the money ends we're going to (40:19 - 40:23)
give now all the money to the new (40:21 - 40:25)
developer you need to fix the bugs (40:23 - 40:27)
because the other game is going to go (40:25 - 40:29)
bye-bye (40:27 - 40:30)
but at a certain point too like when (40:29 - 40:32)
they announced this direwolf digital was (40:30 - 40:35)
like well what are we doing for the next (40:32 - 40:37)
the year besides like adding the (40:35 - 40:40)
expansion packs and fixing bugs because (40:37 - 40:43)
they weren't adding any new features (40:40 - 40:46)
I'm so excited for in like 10 years when (40:43 - 40:49)
they're non-compete non-disclosure (40:46 - 40:51)
Clause ends I'm waiting for the Netflix (40:49 - 40:54)
documentary on how the Pokemon company (40:51 - 40:56)
brewed over direwolf digital because (40:54 - 41:00)
direwolf digital they make other games (40:56 - 41:01)
they make a lot of other great games (41:00 - 41:05)
TCGO and they're good and we have seen (41:01 - 41:07)
little trickles here and there (41:05 - 41:10)
on Twitter and on like Reddit of (41:07 - 41:12)
employees from direwolf digital being (41:10 - 41:16)
like we are so restricted of what we can (41:12 - 41:19)
do and we wanted to do this and we were (41:16 - 41:21)
told no and this is why you have the (41:19 - 41:25)
game you have oh yeah (41:21 - 41:28)
foreign (41:25 - 41:28)
seems a bit (41:34 - 41:39)
uh early that's gonna be uh that's gonna (41:36 - 41:41)
be a 25 30 years (41:39 - 41:43)
sort of a deal that's gonna be like hate (41:41 - 41:44)
death of the universe finally we can (41:43 - 41:47)
tell you how bad Pokemon the company was (41:44 - 41:51)
say what say what you will about 10 cent (41:47 - 41:52)
or DNA (41:51 - 41:55)
or DNA Max Pokemon Masters for the (41:52 - 41:56)
record (41:55 - 41:59)
um or maybe even don't even like those (41:56 - 42:01)
games like I don't like mobas I don't (41:59 - 42:04)
like gotchas I think Pokemon Masters (42:01 - 42:09)
like from a video game standpoint is (42:04 - 42:11)
made well I don't know yeah that you (42:09 - 42:13)
might not like enjoy it you might not (42:11 - 42:16)
like the game play but the game itself (42:13 - 42:19)
is actually like Rock Solid like how can (42:16 - 42:20)
you can tell that from the moment you (42:19 - 42:23)
open the game yeah how can we not enjoy (42:20 - 42:25)
smooching Pokemon trainers from around (42:23 - 42:27)
the world again you might argue that (42:25 - 42:29)
some things in Masters are complex or (42:27 - 42:30)
you don't like the combat or like this (42:29 - 42:32)
doesn't appeal to you but that game like (42:30 - 42:36)
works the music is fantastic the voice (42:32 - 42:38)
acting the like the like for what it is (42:36 - 42:40)
it's great then the same for unite again (42:38 - 42:42)
you might not like mobas it might not be (42:40 - 42:45)
your cup of tea but like besides the (42:42 - 42:47)
issues that unite has maybe some of the (42:45 - 42:50)
balanced stuff like unite feels like a (42:47 - 42:52)
really decent (42:50 - 42:56)
Greg's like maybe not like unite feels (42:52 - 43:00)
like a product here's the thing unite in (42:56 - 43:01)
the game (43:00 - 43:03)
feels brilliant (43:01 - 43:06)
how they have made those menus lag as (43:03 - 43:11)
bad as they do I I do not understand I (43:06 - 43:15)
cannot comprehend how (43:11 - 43:19)
you can lag so hard in just about every (43:15 - 43:22)
menu and every every time you click into (43:19 - 43:26)
an option how that lags that long again (43:22 - 43:28)
the weird thing is is it doesn't affect (43:26 - 43:33)
gameplay which is like (43:28 - 43:33)
every every match is brilliant but the (43:35 - 43:41)
minute I have to go collect my rewards (43:38 - 43:43)
I'm like I'll just do this tomorrow I (43:41 - 43:45)
don't have another five hours to try to (43:43 - 43:47)
get through these menus today (43:45 - 43:51)
but but you but then you so you have (43:47 - 43:54)
unite you have Masters you have we could (43:51 - 43:56)
even throw Pokemon go in there (43:54 - 44:02)
and the TCGO has always been like this (43:56 - 44:06)
like Windows 98 game that we that we've (44:02 - 44:09)
just like lived with because that's what (44:06 - 44:12)
we had I well I will say that (44:09 - 44:16)
they they clearly didn't treat (44:12 - 44:19)
the online presence when that game was (44:16 - 44:22)
made as important right they were still (44:19 - 44:24)
focused on it being a tabletop game it (44:22 - 44:26)
was a nice to have (44:24 - 44:30)
and then when the pandemic forced (44:26 - 44:33)
everybody to be home it no longer became (44:30 - 44:37)
a nice to have it became a absolute must (44:33 - 44:40)
but they were so far down the path of (44:37 - 44:43)
starving that game to death that they (44:40 - 44:46)
weren't about to change directions they (44:43 - 44:48)
were just going to make something new so (44:46 - 44:52)
like I get the fact that like unite and (44:48 - 44:55)
Masters don't have an outside thing (44:52 - 44:58)
right there's there's not an outside (44:55 - 45:02)
version of unite you know that is the (44:58 - 45:03)
game and they knew what it was and they (45:02 - 45:05)
put the money towards it I think they (45:03 - 45:08)
starve direwolf at the start and said (45:05 - 45:09)
we're going to give you x amount of (45:08 - 45:11)
money you will make x amount of money (45:09 - 45:13)
because the package you know it comes (45:11 - 45:16)
out and this is a nice to have and they (45:13 - 45:18)
never Revisited that until they decided (45:16 - 45:19)
we want something new in-house that we (45:18 - 45:22)
have a lot more control over (45:19 - 45:24)
it's it's just so frustrating because (45:22 - 45:26)
like (45:24 - 45:26)
the reason (45:26 - 45:30)
I mean there's a personal reason but the (45:28 - 45:32)
reason I stopped playing Netrunner which (45:30 - 45:35)
was my favorite tabletop card game of (45:32 - 45:37)
all time is just because I there's no (45:35 - 45:38)
one to play with (45:37 - 45:41)
I went out of my way to find hobby shops (45:38 - 45:44)
and leagues and it was like (45:41 - 45:46)
Netrunner Wednesday night okay cool no (45:44 - 45:48)
one showed up okay I guess we're gonna (45:46 - 45:49)
stop doing what net runner on Wednesday (45:48 - 45:51)
nights because no one's showing up and (45:49 - 45:54)
and part of this uh this does not apply (45:51 - 45:56)
to the Pokemon TCG although it's a very (45:54 - 45:58)
common problem but for every card game (45:56 - 46:01)
board game tabletop game sometimes you (45:58 - 46:02)
don't know if you're playing the rules (46:01 - 46:05)
right yep uh so we would be playing (46:02 - 46:08)
Netrunner and be like um I I I read this (46:05 - 46:09)
card back and forth I think we're doing (46:08 - 46:12)
this right maybe we are it'd be nice if (46:09 - 46:15)
like we went to like a group thing where (46:12 - 46:16)
somebody across the table could be like (46:15 - 46:18)
Oh I thought that too but actually this (46:16 - 46:20)
is how your card plays when people are (46:18 - 46:21)
trying to get into the Pokemon Trading (46:20 - 46:25)
Card Game by without hesitation I'm like (46:21 - 46:27)
download PTC Geo that game looks like (46:25 - 46:31)
it's from Windows 98 but the actual (46:27 - 46:35)
intro tutorial of TC PTC Geo was good I (46:31 - 46:38)
mean it looked bad uh like you're like (46:35 - 46:40)
what is this 2D clip art happening here (46:38 - 46:43)
but it legitimately taught you the game (46:40 - 46:45)
and then also the nice thing about TCGO (46:43 - 46:48)
is there was no interpretation like the (46:45 - 46:52)
the game handled the rules like oh you (46:48 - 46:54)
cannot play two energy like the game (46:52 - 46:57)
doesn't let you uh did I tell you about (46:54 - 46:59)
the learning experience I had at Pax (46:57 - 47:01)
unplug about with the TCG game how (46:59 - 47:03)
they're doing yeah the new way they're (47:01 - 47:05)
doing it I think I think if you can go (47:03 - 47:07)
to those events or they're having an (47:05 - 47:09)
event the new way of teaching the game (47:07 - 47:12)
is vastly superior (47:09 - 47:15)
um but again it's just like (47:12 - 47:17)
it is also same for magic as like we'll (47:15 - 47:18)
go to Arena (47:17 - 47:21)
and it will it it will teach you enough (47:18 - 47:24)
of the basics like it the the computer (47:21 - 47:26)
will stop you from breaking the rules (47:24 - 47:28)
and it won't explain to you what the (47:26 - 47:30)
rule is but it will stop you from (47:28 - 47:32)
breaking it and you will still need to (47:30 - 47:34)
read it and figure out why it's stopping (47:32 - 47:36)
you because sometimes you'll be like why (47:34 - 47:38)
can't I do this (47:36 - 47:40)
like there is a rule that you can't have (47:38 - 47:44)
two of the same legendary creature out (47:40 - 47:46)
right so if you have a legendary (47:44 - 47:49)
creature monster B and you have another (47:46 - 47:51)
card when you put the second card out (47:49 - 47:54)
one of those two has to go away (47:51 - 47:56)
the computers like pick and you're like (47:54 - 47:59)
why what am I picking for what is (47:56 - 48:01)
happening because there's this very (47:59 - 48:03)
specific rule that says that can't (48:01 - 48:04)
happen but the game doesn't explain that (48:03 - 48:06)
to you but you can definitely get the (48:04 - 48:09)
basics of how to start the game but it's (48:06 - 48:11)
the problem with a lot of smaller games (48:09 - 48:13)
where it's like (48:11 - 48:15)
I don't have enough people here to teach (48:13 - 48:18)
me how to play this game and for games (48:15 - 48:20)
that have been around for a very long (48:18 - 48:23)
time the rules get so complicated or (48:20 - 48:25)
it's like (48:23 - 48:28)
what is this interaction and (48:25 - 48:30)
what does that mean I mean I have cards (48:28 - 48:33)
in my magic that I have to stop and say (48:30 - 48:37)
to the table okay remind me again what (48:33 - 48:39)
what are we doing here how does this (48:37 - 48:43)
interact with these 17 different things (48:39 - 48:45)
yeah and I want to like I do want to (48:43 - 48:47)
stress for people who maybe don't follow (48:45 - 48:52)
the this very closely is when I I played (48:47 - 48:54)
competitive Pokemon TCG for (48:52 - 48:57)
three years when every weekend I would (48:54 - 48:58)
go to tournaments whether that was like (48:57 - 49:01)
a cities or a battle roads or Estates or (48:58 - 49:02)
regionals (49:01 - 49:07)
um and that was during the time of (49:02 - 49:08)
uh (49:07 - 49:12)
black black two white two and then X and (49:08 - 49:14)
Y and you would get to these tournaments (49:12 - 49:16)
and it would be like we have (49:14 - 49:19)
30 people registered for black two white (49:16 - 49:22)
two tournament we have 400 people (49:19 - 49:25)
registered for the Pokemon Trading Card (49:22 - 49:28)
Game like it was so drastic and we're (49:25 - 49:29)
getting to a point now where like more (49:28 - 49:30)
people are getting more comfortable with (49:29 - 49:34)
the VGC stuff and now like uh like VGC (49:30 - 49:36)
stuff is filling up and they need more (49:34 - 49:38)
spots but the the (49:36 - 49:40)
if you go to a regionals or an in-person (49:38 - 49:44)
tournament the the there is just so many (49:40 - 49:47)
more TCG players out there and I think (49:44 - 49:49)
some of it is (49:47 - 49:51)
um accessibility right like you don't (49:49 - 49:53)
have to you just buy what you need and (49:51 - 49:55)
you're good some of it is just people (49:53 - 49:56)
collecting cards and that coming out (49:55 - 49:58)
every three months and that keeps that (49:56 - 50:00)
engine going (49:58 - 50:03)
um and some of it is just people like to (50:00 - 50:05)
have cards in their hand and they just (50:03 - 50:08)
like to play that like me me too I don't (50:05 - 50:10)
see how (50:08 - 50:14)
making a really good Standalone app (50:10 - 50:16)
pushes people away from that and maybe (50:14 - 50:18)
and I'm sure that's what they thought (50:16 - 50:20)
and I'm sure that's what magic thought (50:18 - 50:22)
very early on too of like oh if we build (50:20 - 50:24)
this online app it's Gonna Hurt our like (50:22 - 50:26)
physical card sales or it's going to (50:24 - 50:28)
hurt our physical tournaments I don't (50:26 - 50:30)
think there's any proof of that I think (50:28 - 50:33)
if anything if (50:30 - 50:35)
it would encourage more people to play (50:33 - 50:37)
and then people playing online for a (50:35 - 50:39)
year might be have the courage enough or (50:37 - 50:40)
the skill set enough to be like I want (50:39 - 50:42)
to go to an in-person tournament but (50:40 - 50:44)
also have have online tournaments as (50:42 - 50:46)
well like because not everyone can (50:44 - 50:49)
travel the issue that I think they run (50:46 - 50:52)
into that is a valid fear is you have to (50:49 - 50:55)
buy like in Magic case you have to (50:52 - 50:57)
pay for packs (50:55 - 51:01)
in the game as well as pay for packs (50:57 - 51:05)
outside of the game so there is a fear (51:01 - 51:07)
and I think it's a valid fear of double (51:05 - 51:09)
dipping into your customer base one that (51:07 - 51:11)
I think (51:09 - 51:14)
has lessons the more they're like oh we (51:11 - 51:15)
can be really greedy with it but I still (51:14 - 51:19)
think it is a valid fear of when you are (51:15 - 51:21)
double dipping when you're hitting the (51:19 - 51:23)
same company customers to pay for things (51:21 - 51:26)
twice there's a limit of how much they (51:23 - 51:29)
want to do that (51:26 - 51:29)
yeah I mean like that was a that was (51:29 - 51:35)
also a thing in TCGO there was so really (51:32 - 51:38)
early on in TCGO you could give it you (51:35 - 51:40)
could you could give it money and then (51:38 - 51:43)
they took it away and I think it like (51:40 - 51:45)
some country they still allowed money (51:43 - 51:46)
but it wasn't the United States or (51:45 - 51:49)
Canada also TCGO wasn't in Japan at all (51:46 - 51:52)
it was no Japan (51:49 - 51:54)
um but the Your solution and we've (51:52 - 51:55)
talked about this on the podcast like (51:54 - 51:57)
like a year or two ago and I think they (51:55 - 51:59)
first announced live was (51:57 - 52:04)
if I wanted more booster packs in TCGO (51:59 - 52:06)
my options were to go out and spend four (52:04 - 52:09)
dollars on a booster pack at Target open (52:06 - 52:12)
that pack redeem the code card or my (52:09 - 52:16)
other option was to go to eBay or a card (52:12 - 52:19)
store like cool stuff Inc and buy bulk (52:16 - 52:22)
cards because somebody's opening a bunch (52:19 - 52:24)
of booster packs and then taking those (52:22 - 52:25)
cards and then putting a big stack and (52:24 - 52:27)
then putting them up on eBay and I could (52:25 - 52:28)
get (52:27 - 52:31)
I could get like 200 booster packs (52:28 - 52:35)
digital booster packs for like 60 or 70 (52:31 - 52:36)
bucks (52:35 - 52:38)
and that was (52:36 - 52:41)
versus one booster pack for four dollars (52:38 - 52:44)
and it's like (52:41 - 52:46)
they know Pokemon knows this is (52:44 - 52:49)
happening they know like they know that (52:46 - 52:52)
listings and stores are selling code (52:49 - 52:56)
cards and do they what if what if they (52:52 - 52:58)
just cut out the middleman and what if I (52:56 - 53:00)
in the app I could just buy a digital (52:58 - 53:02)
booster pack (53:00 - 53:04)
because they're it's it's not an issue (53:02 - 53:06)
of kids well we don't want kids to (53:04 - 53:09)
accidentally do this uh because kids can (53:06 - 53:11)
actually can accidentally spend money in (53:09 - 53:14)
Pokemon go Pokemon (53:11 - 53:18)
unite The Magikarp jump uh the I (53:14 - 53:19)
actually don't think that the (53:18 - 53:20)
toothbrushing game has any (53:19 - 53:23)
microtransactions but if it did they (53:20 - 53:24)
could spend money there so it's it's no (53:23 - 53:26)
longer this argument of like well we (53:24 - 53:28)
want to protect kids from spending money (53:26 - 53:32)
like we now and to be fair to be fair (53:28 - 53:35)
TCGO existed before all of these apps (53:32 - 53:38)
came along and micro transactions were a (53:35 - 53:41)
very common thing in today's society but (53:38 - 53:45)
live has no micro transactions it's the (53:41 - 53:48)
same thing yeah you can buy a booster (53:45 - 53:50)
pack redeem it (53:48 - 53:52)
if you get too many cards it changes (53:50 - 53:54)
that to dust (53:52 - 53:54)
but also live is bad so it's not even we (53:55 - 53:58)
don't even have like this real estate (53:57 - 54:01)
it's so crazy to me that we live in a (53:58 - 54:05)
world where like Hearthstone and uh well (54:01 - 54:07)
I I think most people don't like (54:05 - 54:09)
actually Arena (54:07 - 54:11)
um but but there are a lot of really (54:09 - 54:14)
good card games that have existed like (54:11 - 54:17)
all the Yu-Gi-Oh stuff is really good (54:14 - 54:19)
and then live just kind of feels like (54:17 - 54:22)
we've moved from Windows 98 to like (54:19 - 54:26)
we we moved to like Windows 2001. (54:22 - 54:28)
like we barely we barely took a step (54:26 - 54:31)
forward here well I think actually a lot (54:28 - 54:32)
of people would say we took a step (54:31 - 54:34)
backwards because I I don't even think (54:32 - 54:38)
live has like tournament support at all (54:34 - 54:38)
because in in TCGO you could do like a (54:39 - 54:43)
you could do like a (54:41 - 54:44)
is it I think it was like an (54:43 - 54:46)
eight-person tournament (54:44 - 54:47)
and then if you want it you got like a (54:46 - 54:50)
bunch of booster packs (54:47 - 54:50)
um yeah one I think it was eight I think (54:51 - 54:55)
it was like three rounds and if you won (54:53 - 54:57)
you got like four booster packs and if (54:55 - 54:58)
you came in like a second you got like (54:57 - 55:00)
two (54:58 - 55:00)
live doesn't have that (55:00 - 55:05)
um (55:03 - 55:06)
I don't I don't know what what they're (55:05 - 55:08)
doing over there (55:06 - 55:12)
again allocating resources (55:08 - 55:14)
waiting for that do we even know who's (55:12 - 55:18)
making live is it in house (55:14 - 55:21)
it could be (55:18 - 55:25)
maybe it's ilka (55:21 - 55:25)
I I it's a different style for milka's (55:26 - 55:30)
games (55:28 - 55:30)
and it's going wrong in different ways (55:31 - 55:37)
mean (55:34 - 55:42)
PC box though oh yeah they do (55:37 - 55:43)
um (55:42 - 55:46)
still waiting for that direwolf digital (55:43 - 55:49)
I need to follow every employee at (55:46 - 55:51)
direwolf digital because the second that (55:49 - 55:53)
contractor I need to know what they're (55:51 - 55:56)
about to tweet I mean spoiler alert I (55:53 - 55:57)
know people I know people in that (55:56 - 55:59)
company (55:57 - 55:59)
uh okay some other Pokemon (56:00 - 56:06)
TCG news uh this actually piggybacks off (56:02 - 56:09)
it because it's the scarlet and violet (56:06 - 56:11)
um (56:09 - 56:15)
TCG stuff is coming uh in Japan it looks (56:11 - 56:17)
like it's called triple beat (56:15 - 56:21)
uh it will release on March 10th (56:17 - 56:23)
uh it has very fancy illustration rares (56:21 - 56:25)
of (56:23 - 56:27)
um (56:25 - 56:27)
uh this will be our the US's June set (56:29 - 56:35)
so we should we should be getting (56:36 - 56:41)
the first (56:39 - 56:44)
scarlet and violet stuff in March (56:41 - 56:46)
because Crown Zenith already already (56:44 - 56:49)
came out and then March April May June (56:46 - 56:50)
yeah that makes sense every three months (56:49 - 56:52)
so this would be our triple beatwood by (56:50 - 56:54)
our June set (56:52 - 56:56)
um (56:54 - 56:56)
not not a lot of cards shown but we (56:56 - 57:02)
we're getting like full art very fancy (56:59 - 57:07)
starters uh they showed some tauroses (57:02 - 57:09)
uh they all they all look good all the (57:07 - 57:12)
cards look good there's no complaints (57:09 - 57:14)
there the TCG stuff continues to look (57:12 - 57:16)
really really great somebody's stepping (57:14 - 57:18)
up their art game over over big (57:16 - 57:19)
creatures or whoever's making these (57:18 - 57:20)
cards (57:19 - 57:23)
um so (57:20 - 57:25)
we know at least some cards to expect (57:23 - 57:29)
but that that comes out (57:25 - 57:32)
next month in Japan (57:29 - 57:32)
and (57:32 - 57:37)
yeah (57:34 - 57:37)
Scarlet Scarlet cards seem exciting (57:38 - 57:42)
oh yeah (57:41 - 57:44)
I mean I even as someone who didn't play (57:42 - 57:48)
the TCG always won a new generation had (57:44 - 57:49)
their cards coming out for the first (57:48 - 57:51)
time or (57:49 - 57:52)
just new Pokemon in there for the first (57:51 - 57:54)
time that's always exciting I like the (57:52 - 57:58)
pictures they're real pretty (57:54 - 57:58)
and the the full art (58:00 - 58:04)
is then (58:02 - 58:06)
the full art sprigatito Fuego and (58:04 - 58:08)
quaxley those are the replacement for (58:06 - 58:11)
rainbow rares right (58:08 - 58:11)
or that they they can be that they still (58:11 - 58:17)
have the the holographic Rainbow on them (58:13 - 58:20)
is what I've seen (58:17 - 58:20)
um I don't think that the replacement I (58:20 - 58:25)
think they're are they are they (58:23 - 58:28)
considering those trainer gallery or (58:25 - 58:29)
what did the word suck cash I can't (58:28 - 58:32)
remember what they're called (58:29 - 58:34)
something gallery (58:32 - 58:35)
but maybe they changed the wording on (58:34 - 58:38)
that (58:35 - 58:38)
I'm not sure what these are falling (58:38 - 58:41)
under (58:40 - 58:42)
okay (58:41 - 58:44)
they're really pretty we don't fully (58:42 - 58:45)
know (58:44 - 58:47)
I think I think it's safe to say that (58:45 - 58:50)
rainbow rare's got completely cut (58:47 - 58:50)
um well I I guess I don't know the the (58:50 - 58:55)
new Rarity (58:53 - 58:57)
structure (58:55 - 59:00)
of the cards I'm I'm sure it's somewhere (58:57 - 59:01)
on Pokey beacher's therapy or Bulbapedia (59:00 - 59:03)
of like what the new Rarity is but I (59:01 - 59:05)
will know a hundred percent next month (59:03 - 59:06)
when (59:05 - 59:09)
set one comes out of (59:06 - 59:11)
there's also Rarity in Rarity like if (59:09 - 59:13)
you look at Crown Zenith I think it's (59:11 - 59:15)
like the Giratina is like significantly (59:13 - 59:18)
more rare than like the the algon Palkia (59:15 - 59:20)
even though they're all considered gold (59:18 - 59:21)
cards (59:20 - 59:23)
um (59:21 - 59:23)
it's weird (59:23 - 59:26)
uh speaking of weird uh (59:26 - 59:34)
Nintendo of Canada's Susan Penny father (59:30 - 59:36)
I didn't know this was a role or a (59:34 - 59:39)
position there's a (59:36 - 59:40)
kiss (59:39 - 59:42)
Nintendo America Nintendo of Canada I (59:40 - 59:44)
guess you don't really think of it uh (59:42 - 59:47)
somebody cornered her for an interview (59:44 - 59:51)
with very eight specific questions no (59:47 - 59:52)
more no less (59:51 - 59:55)
uh this was published February 2nd this (59:52 - 59:57)
was off the financialpost.com this (59:55 - 59:59)
sounds like a (59:57 - 60:03)
not an actual News website (59:59 - 60:03)
I don't know (60:03 - 60:08)
uh what's that like website in in the UK (60:06 - 60:10)
it's like the sun or something where (60:08 - 60:12)
it's like oh yeah don't don't read (60:10 - 60:14)
everything from the Sun is bad it's like (60:12 - 60:18)
the National Enquirer yeah yeah yeah (60:14 - 60:20)
uh there look there are eight questions (60:18 - 60:23)
we don't need all of them uh we'll read (60:20 - 60:24)
the Pokemon specific ones (60:23 - 60:26)
uh (60:24 - 60:30)
post arcade says uh those are the people (60:26 - 60:33)
I guess answering or asking (60:30 - 60:35)
um probably like (60:33 - 60:37)
anyways uh Nintendo has enjoyed a very (60:35 - 60:39)
good stretch since the switch launched (60:37 - 60:41)
in 2017 how do you feel about the last (60:39 - 60:46)
12 months uh she talks about uh (60:41 - 60:48)
resonating strong with Canadians really (60:46 - 60:52)
good Hardware Sales Mario Kart 8 the (60:48 - 60:54)
booster pack course she also talks about (60:52 - 60:56)
Splatoon and Splatoon 3 and then she (60:54 - 60:58)
goes on and says and then there's (60:56 - 61:00)
Pokemon it is the highest grossing (60:58 - 61:01)
entertainment media franchise of all (61:00 - 61:03)
time it's technically not true anymore (61:01 - 61:07)
it's Winnie the Pooh with more than 444 (61:03 - 61:10)
million games sold worldwide in November (61:07 - 61:12)
we launched Pokemon scarlet and violet (61:10 - 61:14)
which sold 10 million units globally in (61:12 - 61:16)
three days which is the largest launch (61:14 - 61:19)
weekend in the Brand's history in (61:16 - 61:22)
Nintendo's history (61:19 - 61:22)
uh (61:23 - 61:27)
they talk about a little bit more (61:25 - 61:28)
software and Publishing on the switch (61:27 - 61:32)
they talk about switch online (61:28 - 61:35)
they mentioned golden eye (61:32 - 61:38)
that came and went already (61:35 - 61:38)
um (61:41 - 61:44)
uh then the question asked the latest (61:42 - 61:47)
Pokemon games proved wildly successful (61:44 - 61:49)
but also suffered from Plenty of (61:47 - 61:51)
performance problems and glitches a (61:49 - 61:53)
problem not common in Nintendo (61:51 - 61:55)
exclusives what did you learn from the (61:53 - 61:56)
software launch this is a really good (61:55 - 61:58)
question honestly (61:56 - 61:59)
um (61:58 - 62:01)
Suzanne says you know we absolutely (61:59 - 62:03)
apologize because it's so important to (62:01 - 62:05)
give players a positive experience with (62:03 - 62:06)
our games and when this doesn't happen (62:05 - 62:09)
we take it very much to heart what I can (62:06 - 62:10)
say is the feedback from players have (62:09 - 62:12)
absolutely been taken seriously we are (62:10 - 62:16)
working on improving these games (62:12 - 62:17)
um and then they talk about some mobile (62:16 - 62:19)
stuff (62:17 - 62:21)
but (62:19 - 62:24)
uh it's a good question (62:21 - 62:26)
and even though like (62:24 - 62:30)
you know we heard three weeks ago that a (62:26 - 62:32)
February update is coming (62:30 - 62:34)
but you know who knows when that (62:32 - 62:35)
update's gonna be (62:34 - 62:38)
I mean it's Pokemon day it has to be (62:35 - 62:39)
Pokemon day (62:38 - 62:41)
uh yeah I (62:39 - 62:42)
um (62:41 - 62:45)
I don't go to here (62:42 - 62:47)
that being repeated that it's being (62:45 - 62:50)
taken seriously yes we'll have to see if (62:47 - 62:52)
there's follow through (62:50 - 62:54)
but it's good to hear that the (62:52 - 62:57)
disappointment got through because it (62:54 - 62:59)
doesn't always it didn't with brilliant (62:57 - 63:03)
Diamond shining Pearl foreign (62:59 - 63:03)
you're right it did not (63:03 - 63:08)
I mean there was enough backlash for the (63:06 - 63:10)
national decks that they put out a (63:08 - 63:12)
statement being like we heard you we (63:10 - 63:14)
don't care (63:12 - 63:14)
supposedly they care about this one (63:15 - 63:21)
yeah I I actually think that the update (63:18 - 63:24)
will be before Pokemon day (63:21 - 63:26)
so they can (63:24 - 63:29)
not focus on it (63:26 - 63:31)
so my assumption would be like usually (63:29 - 63:33)
updates come out on like Thursday nights (63:31 - 63:35)
because that's usually when raids reset (63:33 - 63:37)
that's when we got our first update was (63:35 - 63:38)
on a Thursday that's where we got a lot (63:37 - 63:40)
of the sword and shield updates we're on (63:38 - 63:42)
a Thursday I would maybe say we get it (63:40 - 63:44)
on like the 23rd Pokemon days on a (63:42 - 63:47)
Monday and then on Monday (63:44 - 63:48)
they just (63:47 - 63:52)
gloss over it because my assumption and (63:48 - 63:53)
I think some people are going to get mad (63:52 - 63:54)
about this (63:53 - 63:56)
this update is going to come (63:54 - 63:59)
gosh maybe not my assumption My Hope Is (63:56 - 64:01)
that this update is frame rate the PC (63:59 - 64:03)
boxes getting stuck in raids like those (64:01 - 64:05)
are probably the top three that come to (64:03 - 64:07)
mind for issues (64:05 - 64:09)
um maybe game crashes just fix all of (64:07 - 64:12)
that and then on Pokemon day you don't (64:09 - 64:14)
really have to mention it but you can at (64:12 - 64:16)
that point you can say like well this is (64:14 - 64:18)
the content coming or like these are the (64:16 - 64:20)
new rates coming because you can say (64:18 - 64:22)
like hey we have a seven star Mewtwo (64:20 - 64:24)
raid coming which I think would be very (64:22 - 64:25)
exciting or I don't know or like a seven (64:24 - 64:29)
star whatever insert Pokemon here (64:25 - 64:29)
um (64:29 - 64:32)
and then you don't have to focus on what (64:29 - 64:36)
we just released this huge patch you (64:32 - 64:36)
Pokemon day (64:38 - 64:42)
that's why I think they would do it like (64:41 - 64:46)
slightly before and then instead of (64:42 - 64:46)
mentioning it during the press release (64:47 - 64:50)
and then all the news outlets picking up (64:49 - 64:53)
like oh like they're fixing the like (64:50 - 64:56)
they can kind of double dip in the news (64:53 - 64:58)
at that point (64:56 - 64:59)
because Pokemon day is supposed to be a (64:58 - 65:00)
celebration I don't know if they want to (64:59 - 65:02)
spend their celebration being like we (65:00 - 65:06)
fixed our broken best-selling (65:02 - 65:09)
maybe I mean I think it would still I (65:06 - 65:11)
think for a hardcore fan you would get (65:09 - 65:13)
Goodwill there (65:11 - 65:15)
um I think for a casual person they (65:13 - 65:17)
would be like oh I've only put 15 hours (65:15 - 65:20)
in I was it broken (65:17 - 65:23)
I feel like even casual people can tell (65:20 - 65:25)
yeah I think so I mean there are still (65:23 - 65:29)
some people that are like I (65:25 - 65:30)
they're like I don't have no problem (65:29 - 65:32)
with the frame rate issue like yeah like (65:30 - 65:37)
I get that too like at a certain point (65:32 - 65:37)
that brain adjusts to it right yeah like (65:37 - 65:43)
I I I haven't like I'm not a PC Gamer so (65:40 - 65:46)
I've never played like 120 frames a (65:43 - 65:47)
second like shooter or anything I'm sure (65:46 - 65:49)
if I did play that for several hours and (65:47 - 65:51)
I went back I'd be like oh my gosh the (65:49 - 65:53)
difference here but like because I'm a (65:51 - 65:55)
console player (65:53 - 65:57)
um (65:55 - 66:00)
I don't know what 120 frame rate is but (65:57 - 66:01)
I'm sure that is for some people like (66:00 - 66:03)
very casual they don't they can't really (66:01 - 66:05)
feel the difference between like 16 (66:03 - 66:07)
frames and 25 frames they're just like (66:05 - 66:10)
ah it's a little slow but (66:07 - 66:13)
they might not know what the language is (66:10 - 66:13)
yeah but Pokemon day is coming it's on (66:15 - 66:18)
Monday (66:17 - 66:21)
uh so (66:18 - 66:22)
I don't know I I don't know what that (66:21 - 66:24)
podcast is going to be I guess we'll (66:22 - 66:25)
record our normal show before Monday (66:24 - 66:27)
maybe I'll do like a small bonus episode (66:25 - 66:30)
after and then so people don't have to (66:27 - 66:31)
wait a full week I'm not I'm not sure (66:30 - 66:34)
what that's going to look like but (66:31 - 66:35)
I also don't know what Pokemon day is (66:34 - 66:36)
going to look like (66:35 - 66:39)
I think I think there's the uh the (66:36 - 66:40)
assumption (66:39 - 66:42)
that (66:40 - 66:45)
you know my myself included uh you know (66:42 - 66:47)
this show included people love to look (66:45 - 66:49)
at patterns right like you know X and Y (66:47 - 66:52)
where's Pokemon Z black and white (66:49 - 66:54)
where's Pokemon Gray those are two (66:52 - 66:56)
instances where the the pattern was (66:54 - 66:58)
broken right (66:56 - 66:59)
um (66:58 - 67:02)
so because we have one game with DLC (66:59 - 67:06)
that that game had two DLCs uh Crown (67:02 - 67:08)
Tundra and Isle of armor (67:06 - 67:11)
is Scarlet Violet getting another two (67:08 - 67:14)
DLCs one in June one in Fall I did see (67:11 - 67:17)
somebody suggest like what if it just (67:14 - 67:18)
had one DLC and I didn't really think (67:17 - 67:21)
about that but yeah what if it did what (67:18 - 67:25)
if it had one big DLC in the fall (67:21 - 67:25)
and maybe that sells better maybe that's (67:25 - 67:32)
more exciting like I kind of felt (67:27 - 67:32)
and I would love your guys's opinion I (67:32 - 67:38)
felt like Isle of armor was so hype and (67:35 - 67:40)
so exciting because it was like the (67:38 - 67:43)
first DLC it was also maybe it may be it (67:40 - 67:44)
benefited because the pandemic just (67:43 - 67:46)
recently started right and everyone was (67:44 - 67:48)
at home because that was in June (67:46 - 67:50)
but I felt like people were so much more (67:48 - 67:52)
excited for Isle of armor and then when (67:50 - 67:55)
Crown Tundra came people were like (67:52 - 67:57)
I'll get to it (67:55 - 67:57)
that was the opposite of my experience (68:00 - 68:04)
but Isle of armor came out at a bad time (68:02 - 68:08)
for me yeah I I think (68:04 - 68:08)
um (68:08 - 68:13)
I think some of them people experienced (68:10 - 68:15)
were were a lot of people who didn't (68:13 - 68:17)
find Isle of armor that exciting right (68:15 - 68:19)
like there's a lot of people are like oh (68:17 - 68:22)
and now I see what this is and I'll get (68:19 - 68:24)
to it when I get to it I also think (68:22 - 68:26)
there was excitement because you paid (68:24 - 68:28)
for a thing and you're excited for that (68:26 - 68:31)
thing to happen and then the second (68:28 - 68:33)
thing you what you was since it was all (68:31 - 68:36)
one payment there wasn't as much like (68:33 - 68:40)
internal ownership of the second DLC (68:36 - 68:43)
because it was it felt it felt like a (68:40 - 68:45)
bonus it felt like you paid for the (68:43 - 68:48)
first one and the second one was a bonus (68:45 - 68:51)
and I think that affected people's (68:48 - 68:54)
willingness to talk about it online it's (68:51 - 68:56)
hard to say because you know (68:54 - 68:59)
there are many many many people who love (68:56 - 69:02)
one over the other right like you have (68:59 - 69:05)
your kind of tundra Fanatics and you (69:02 - 69:08)
have your Isle of armor Fanatics so I (69:05 - 69:09)
think it's hard to say to draw any (69:08 - 69:12)
conclusions about reception but I do (69:09 - 69:15)
think we can say that overall there was (69:12 - 69:19)
much more Buzz about the first ever DLC (69:15 - 69:22)
than there was about the part two simply (69:19 - 69:25)
because we knew roughly what to expect (69:22 - 69:28)
and I'm curious what the buzz will be (69:25 - 69:31)
around this one because we are once (69:28 - 69:32)
again (69:31 - 69:36)
we now know what their DLC looks like (69:32 - 69:38)
what they did for one and so you can (69:36 - 69:42)
kind of draw some parallels so I it's (69:38 - 69:43)
hard to say like I think people are (69:42 - 69:46)
excited for a date DLC but I don't think (69:43 - 69:49)
we'll ever get the same levels as the (69:46 - 69:52)
first ever DLC for Pokemon that we did (69:49 - 69:53)
with I love armor (69:52 - 69:55)
it's probably true this one is a little (69:53 - 69:57)
different though in that it's it's (69:55 - 70:00)
finishing the story even more this is (69:57 - 70:02)
going to be right I mean there are hints (70:00 - 70:03)
there are (70:02 - 70:05)
there's the book with the third (70:03 - 70:07)
legendary in it we're kind of expecting (70:05 - 70:11)
more background to how this all happened (70:07 - 70:12)
right (70:11 - 70:14)
and hopefully we will get it (70:12 - 70:19)
hopefully yeah but I mean they left (70:14 - 70:21)
I mean I was gonna say I think this is (70:19 - 70:23)
the first game where (70:21 - 70:26)
they have proof that a DLC works so they (70:23 - 70:30)
could write a continuation story (70:26 - 70:33)
yeah I mean they they also left certain (70:30 - 70:34)
Assets in the game right like there's (70:33 - 70:37)
there's uh (70:34 - 70:40)
well they they left the (70:37 - 70:42)
they gave us the hint of a third Legend (70:40 - 70:45)
right the the big ball (70:42 - 70:47)
frog lizard I don't know what it's (70:45 - 70:49)
supposed to be what what are people (70:47 - 70:51)
calling it like a turtle a frog I don't (70:49 - 70:52)
know what it's supposed you see the (70:51 - 70:55)
picture yeah I think and then they like (70:52 - 70:57)
black out its name and they're like this (70:55 - 70:59)
is the cause of the crystals but in the (70:57 - 71:02)
in the game (70:59 - 71:06)
code that Pokemon doesn't exist (71:02 - 71:08)
but there are other like legendary (71:06 - 71:10)
Pokemon in the game code that do exist (71:08 - 71:12)
like Mewtwo's in there zashian's in (71:10 - 71:14)
there a lot of like the legendaries are (71:12 - 71:16)
are in the game code but they're (71:14 - 71:19)
inaccessible (71:16 - 71:19)
um and then there are two new Legends (71:19 - 71:24)
based off (71:22 - 71:25)
I'll just say like they're kind of like (71:24 - 71:27)
the gallerian birds (71:25 - 71:30)
so Pokemon we have gallerian fight (71:27 - 71:34)
whatever they're in the game code or (71:30 - 71:36)
again we're pictures of them are in (71:34 - 71:38)
there not accessible (71:36 - 71:40)
so it's like well they made these new (71:38 - 71:43)
Pokemon gallery or Pal day paldayin (71:40 - 71:46)
Legends or whatever pal day in Legends (71:43 - 71:49)
so they have to be coming (71:46 - 71:52)
but also we know (71:49 - 71:54)
there was like no sign of calorics there (71:52 - 71:56)
was no sign of glass tree or there was (71:54 - 72:00)
no sign of Specter like it's almost like (71:56 - 72:00)
they they can why did they put that in (72:02 - 72:06)
there almost like because they knew (72:04 - 72:07)
people would find it to talk about it (72:06 - 72:11)
yeah because again (72:07 - 72:13)
they could have not put that in right (72:11 - 72:14)
like (72:13 - 72:18)
they didn't put Galleria and Slowpoke in (72:14 - 72:21)
any of the game and then one day it just (72:18 - 72:23)
showed up at a train station (72:21 - 72:24)
so it's like (72:23 - 72:26)
it's like interesting that they're like (72:24 - 72:30)
we want to give you some stuff (72:26 - 72:32)
and which which I think you know going (72:30 - 72:34)
back like (72:32 - 72:36)
you know we watch that trailer and (72:34 - 72:38)
tandemouse was in like the map (72:36 - 72:40)
and it was like oh what like intern (72:38 - 72:42)
forgot to remove tantamounts at a (72:40 - 72:44)
certain point it's like they have to be (72:42 - 72:47)
doing this on purpose oh absolutely they (72:44 - 72:49)
know that like we leave a little icon of (72:47 - 72:51)
a Pokemon here people are going to talk (72:49 - 72:53)
about it if we give a hint that there's (72:51 - 72:55)
a paldayin legend of an old Pokemon (72:53 - 72:58)
people are going to talk about it (72:55 - 72:59)
um (72:58 - 73:01)
and so there's no doubt that they're (72:59 - 73:04)
setting up some sort of content but (73:01 - 73:06)
again whether that would be one DLC two (73:04 - 73:11)
DLC 3D like I I don't know it would be a (73:06 - 73:14)
sequel probably not but could be could (73:11 - 73:17)
be going back to Kalos (73:14 - 73:21)
I think almost I would want one big DLC (73:17 - 73:24)
instead of two little ones (73:21 - 73:27)
I think like I I do feel like there is (73:24 - 73:30)
something almost seasonal slash special (73:27 - 73:34)
about like November hitting and having (73:30 - 73:37)
this huge Pokemon thing to consume into (73:34 - 73:39)
the holidays (73:37 - 73:43)
uh although I had a great time with Isle (73:39 - 73:44)
of armor like and I don't I don't know (73:43 - 73:46)
if that was because of the pandemic but (73:44 - 73:47)
like I feel like no games come out in (73:46 - 73:50)
June so Isle of arms hitting in June (73:47 - 73:53)
felt really refreshing (73:50 - 73:53)
but it did feel small like once you (73:53 - 73:58)
completed it obviously it was you know (73:56 - 74:00)
pretty tiny (73:58 - 74:00)
I don't know what I want honestly from (74:03 - 74:07)
from a DLC for this game I wanted I'm (74:05 - 74:11)
there too I want to continue the story (74:07 - 74:13)
I want answers sooner rather than later (74:11 - 74:15)
is the problem yeah (74:13 - 74:18)
I would be fine with two I would be fine (74:15 - 74:21)
with one but would have to be really (74:18 - 74:22)
Hefty (74:21 - 74:25)
um I do think (74:22 - 74:25)
there is there is benefit in having two (74:25 - 74:32)
that come out quicker that are smaller (74:30 - 74:34)
to keep people coming back to your game (74:32 - 74:37)
although I don't know that they I think (74:34 - 74:39)
they've hit (74:37 - 74:42)
a pattern with raids that they like so I (74:39 - 74:44)
think it's very likely that they might (74:42 - 74:47)
just go for one big DLC and allow Seven (74:44 - 74:49)
Star raids to carry them for a long time (74:47 - 74:51)
to keep people coming back to the game (74:49 - 74:54)
um I think personally as far as like a (74:51 - 74:56)
time management thing I would rather (74:54 - 74:58)
have two I'd rather have two smaller (74:56 - 75:00)
things than one big thing that I have to (74:58 - 75:03)
devote a lot more time to because time (75:00 - 75:05)
is a premium (75:03 - 75:09)
yeah I I can see the one because they (75:05 - 75:12)
have found their their flow with seven (75:09 - 75:14)
star and they haven't introduced any (75:12 - 75:16)
shiny raids yet (75:14 - 75:17)
um which if they if they start doing (75:16 - 75:20)
that again Seven Stars and shiny raids (75:17 - 75:22)
it's almost like the Pokemon go thing of (75:20 - 75:24)
like well we got something to do every (75:22 - 75:25)
weekend (75:24 - 75:28)
um which I'm still (75:25 - 75:29)
leaning more towards maybe this (75:28 - 75:31)
tandemouse is the first time they do (75:29 - 75:33)
shiny because it's tandem Mouse it's not (75:31 - 75:36)
Mouse hold yeah and (75:33 - 75:38)
the whole gimmick is like oh it's one in (75:36 - 75:41)
a hundred to evolve so they maybe don't (75:38 - 75:43)
care if you get five or six shiny (75:41 - 75:46)
tandemouse because if they all evolve (75:43 - 75:47)
into family of four you're gonna be like (75:46 - 75:51)
man I wish I got 10 or 12 to try again (75:47 - 75:52)
you know what I mean like it almost (75:51 - 75:55)
seems perfect for like the first shiny (75:52 - 75:57)
event I'm excited for my tandemus (75:55 - 75:59)
community today because I'll get my (75:57 - 76:03)
three at that point (75:59 - 76:03)
2015 as we're going through the (76:03 - 76:08)
Wasteland looking for stops (76:05 - 76:11)
yeah I I'm (76:08 - 76:14)
it's another Pokemon day so everyone in (76:11 - 76:15)
the world will be like Pokemon sleep (76:14 - 76:18)
finally here who knows detective Pikachu (76:15 - 76:21)
2 who knows they're just gonna skip the (76:18 - 76:23)
detective Pikachu three this would be (76:21 - 76:25)
the last episode that will come up yeah (76:23 - 76:27)
much later (76:25 - 76:30)
yeah I I (76:27 - 76:33)
I wonder if they announced a movie (76:30 - 76:33)
it's been a while for a movie I I if (76:34 - 76:38)
there was to be a movie it'd probably be (76:37 - 76:41)
Ash right like they'd probably (76:38 - 76:42)
maybe they're gonna have some live (76:41 - 76:44)
action we know at this point (76:42 - 76:46)
yeah they could they could go into the (76:44 - 76:48)
live action if that's still actually (76:46 - 76:50)
happening (76:48 - 76:53)
is there any Nintendo 64 Pokemon games (76:50 - 76:55)
that they're missing puzzle League I (76:53 - 76:57)
think is on there stadiums are both (76:55 - 77:00)
people yeah we'll get both the stadiums (76:57 - 77:02)
well I'm sure on Pokemon day they'll be (77:00 - 77:05)
like oh next week or later today the (77:02 - 77:06)
state because I don't think they have a (77:05 - 77:08)
date yet I think they just said coming (77:06 - 77:09)
soon right it was supposed to be after (77:08 - 77:11)
GoldenEye and we just got golden eye (77:09 - 77:13)
yeah (77:11 - 77:15)
um (77:13 - 77:15)
yeah I don't I don't know I maybe they (77:15 - 77:20)
announced something with Pokemon bank (77:18 - 77:23)
because that is (77:20 - 77:27)
done in February well not done (77:23 - 77:30)
oh yeah March 20 something they said (77:27 - 77:32)
like counting down the days till I can (77:30 - 77:35)
get into my bank again because I said it (77:32 - 77:37)
will go free (77:35 - 77:41)
but you have to download it before it (77:37 - 77:44)
goes away I don't yeah that that's gonna (77:41 - 77:47)
be a hot mess when that happens (77:44 - 77:49)
unless they do some final update where (77:47 - 77:51)
it's like (77:49 - 77:52)
I don't even know how they send Pokemon (77:51 - 77:55)
through a QR code or something like the (77:52 - 77:56)
Nintendo switch you gotta take like four (77:55 - 77:58)
pictures of a QR code and then hit yeah (77:56 - 78:03)
I mean they can definitely do that yeah (77:58 - 78:03)
um yeah there's like I feel like this is (78:04 - 78:08)
the most (78:06 - 78:10)
ambiguous (78:08 - 78:13)
Pokemon day yet (78:10 - 78:16)
because like we're sitting on so many (78:13 - 78:17)
things that we know they've been working (78:16 - 78:22)
on and it's like every year they skip it (78:17 - 78:22)
um I believe the scar sword and shield (78:27 - 78:32)
DLC got announced before Pokemon day (78:30 - 78:35)
though I believe that was (78:32 - 78:35)
um (78:36 - 78:40)
January they announced it and then they (78:36 - 78:41)
sh (78:40 - 78:43)
showed it off during Pokemon day didn't (78:41 - 78:45)
they (78:43 - 78:48)
I think I think I think so I think they (78:45 - 78:51)
had a Pokemon thing in January and then (78:48 - 78:53)
they (78:51 - 78:53)
talked more about it on Pokemon day I (78:53 - 78:57)
don't know I don't remember I mean it's (78:56 - 78:59)
very like I don't remember like that was (78:57 - 79:01)
17 years ago (78:59 - 79:04)
