you are in uh Columbus at the moment I (2:23 - 2:29)
would have been in Columbus today (2:27 - 2:31)
however I had a little bit of a travel (2:29 - 2:36)
issue this morning uh I am in my day job (2:31 - 2:39)
a event production person I'm in event (2:36 - 2:41)
production I had an event I was doing an (2:39 - 2:43)
event it was in Montreal I thought okay (2:41 - 2:44)
you know what I'm gonna fly from (2:43 - 2:48)
Montreal to Columbus so I go over to the (2:44 - 2:50)
Montreal Airport to try and get over to (2:48 - 2:52)
Columbus and the international line is (2:50 - 2:54)
like three days long I was there for (2:52 - 2:57)
three and a half hours waiting that (2:54 - 2:58)
whole time to get through International (2:57 - 3:00)
customs and by the time I get to my gate (2:58 - 3:03)
it's 6 15 my flight's at six they're (3:00 - 3:04)
like there's no more flights out to (3:03 - 3:06)
Columbus today (3:04 - 3:08)
there's no more flights out to Toronto (3:06 - 3:10)
today which is where I live because I (3:08 - 3:12)
was just gonna go home so I had to go (3:10 - 3:14)
and Uber over to a train station and (3:12 - 3:16)
take a train from (3:14 - 3:19)
Montreal to Toronto I thought you were (3:16 - 3:22)
able to fly at home like two hours ago (3:19 - 3:24)
oh wow that's even worse than I (3:22 - 3:26)
originally thought it was I was I was (3:24 - 3:27)
messaging the whole time I was like yeah (3:26 - 3:29)
hey is there any chance like Newark (3:27 - 3:31)
Airport isn't that bad just fly over to (3:29 - 3:33)
Newark instead and then we can we can (3:31 - 3:35)
make it here it was crazy crazy about (3:33 - 3:37)
all of this is I thought I was gonna (3:35 - 3:40)
miss it yes because you got delayed I (3:37 - 3:41)
was supposed to get in yesterday into (3:40 - 3:44)
Columbus and I just got a text being (3:41 - 3:48)
like your plane is broken uh you know we (3:44 - 3:50)
can send you tomorrow and then (3:48 - 3:53)
um the entire time I knew that the I had (3:50 - 3:55)
a connecting flight in Atlanta and I (3:53 - 3:57)
knew the entire time it was overbooked (3:55 - 3:59)
like by 20 seats and I didn't have a (3:57 - 4:00)
seat and I was like (3:59 - 4:02)
if they put me on it cool if they (4:00 - 4:04)
offered me like 500 bucks to like wait (4:02 - 4:06)
longer cool but I missed the podcast but (4:04 - 4:08)
I have 500 bucks I think I never (4:06 - 4:10)
registered that you were in Atlanta yeah (4:08 - 4:12)
yeah it was a direct don't you like not (4:10 - 4:14)
live that far from here yeah if it was (4:12 - 4:16)
direct it would have been two hours but (4:14 - 4:17)
they sent me two and a half hours to (4:16 - 4:20)
Atlanta to then send me 90 minutes back (4:17 - 4:21)
to Columbus (4:20 - 4:24)
flights it's all fun flight status yeah (4:21 - 4:25)
I had a direct flight it was pretty easy (4:24 - 4:27)
for me I have nothing to say (4:25 - 4:30)
I had a pretty good (4:27 - 4:30)
the workaround to that I got home and my (4:32 - 4:36)
my partner was like hey you want to just (4:34 - 4:38)
drive there and have a like weekend we (4:36 - 4:40)
can have a weekend you can have your (4:38 - 4:43)
weekend so right after this podcast I am (4:40 - 4:46)
going to drive seven hours over to Ohio (4:43 - 4:47)
I was gonna say how long is the drive (4:46 - 4:50)
but seven hours no you must really love (4:47 - 4:52)
Pokemon Michael I must really love (4:50 - 4:55)
Pokemon to be in transit for over 15 (4:52 - 4:56)
hours (4:55 - 5:00)
okay so for for context we're putting (4:56 - 5:01)
this at like seven we'll probably finish (5:00 - 5:03)
around like later what time are you (5:01 - 5:04)
getting here uh probably around three (5:03 - 5:07)
three a.m 3 A.M I'll stay up for you (5:04 - 5:09)
yeah it'll be fun we can both be sleepy (5:07 - 5:10)
tomorrow don't don't force it because (5:09 - 5:12)
you have you have like a competing oh (5:10 - 5:14)
yeah you're competing wait were you (5:12 - 5:17)
planning to compete yeah I'm still going (5:14 - 5:19)
to it was so funny because when we got (5:17 - 5:23)
to the BNB we were playing some some (5:19 - 5:25)
some online competitive stuff Pokemon (5:23 - 5:27)
yes we were playing some Pokemon oh yeah (5:25 - 5:30)
Pokemon yeah (5:27 - 5:32)
and it was so sad because I went to go (5:30 - 5:34)
put my team in a battle box so I can (5:32 - 5:36)
play it online and then I saw your team (5:34 - 5:37)
right there because I'm holding it for (5:36 - 5:39)
him I was like this team will never see (5:37 - 5:42)
play it was so sad (5:39 - 5:42)
well I'm a little scared too because I (5:43 - 5:48)
need to register my team before what 7 (5:45 - 5:52)
30 tomorrow so the way okay so there was (5:48 - 5:55)
a gigantic line for for checking to the (5:52 - 5:56)
point where (5:55 - 5:59)
it went around the building almost three (5:56 - 6:00)
times (5:59 - 6:01)
it was ridiculous it went around the (6:00 - 6:03)
corner went all the way down did two (6:01 - 6:05)
Loops then there was still a little maze (6:03 - 6:07)
portion of it did check in start today (6:05 - 6:09)
or could you do it yesterday it started (6:07 - 6:10)
today okay and the window for it was (6:09 - 6:13)
only five to eight that is the window (6:10 - 6:14)
for checking (6:13 - 6:17)
so if you are competing they even sent (6:14 - 6:19)
out a mass email that says if you are (6:17 - 6:21)
competing we highly recommend that you (6:19 - 6:22)
don't come in the morning because we (6:21 - 6:25)
can't guarantee that you'll get in (6:22 - 6:28)
so that's why I said to you (6:25 - 6:30)
good luck you might miss one round but (6:28 - 6:32)
good luck yeah I might need to be the (6:30 - 6:35)
first one in the line honestly but in (6:32 - 6:37)
all we got through it really fast like (6:35 - 6:40)
there was at least I'd say around 3 000 (6:37 - 6:42)
people on that line by the time we (6:40 - 6:43)
actually got to it and there were still (6:42 - 6:46)
a bunch of people behind us so so (6:43 - 6:48)
hopefully they all did it today side (6:46 - 6:51)
Pokemon story I I went to like a couple (6:48 - 6:53)
of like battle roads the battle roads (6:51 - 6:54)
don't exist anymore okay uh back in the (6:53 - 6:56)
day when I was doing TCG this was in the (6:54 - 6:58)
black and white came out (6:56 - 7:01)
and so I felt confident enough and just (6:58 - 7:02)
had extra money that I decided to fly (7:01 - 7:05)
out to Worlds (7:02 - 7:08)
um in San Diego so this was like okay (7:05 - 7:10)
black and white was the game but I was (7:08 - 7:12)
playing TCG and they had a last chance (7:10 - 7:14)
qualifier so I was like I'm just gonna (7:12 - 7:15)
fly out to California and do the last (7:14 - 7:17)
chance qualifier that was their biggest (7:15 - 7:20)
event at the time (7:17 - 7:23)
um and uh they had 200 plus people that (7:20 - 7:27)
got a round one by because they just (7:23 - 7:30)
didn't have seating for them wow so not (7:27 - 7:33)
only did the TCG thing start like two (7:30 - 7:36)
hours late 200 people were just round (7:33 - 7:37)
one like you got a free win because like (7:36 - 7:39)
we need to eliminate because it was last (7:37 - 7:41)
chance qualifier so you only did like (7:39 - 7:43)
one match and if you won you moved on if (7:41 - 7:45)
you didn't you're out out that sure is a (7:43 - 7:48)
solution that's a solution as soon as we (7:45 - 7:50)
eliminate half of the people the other (7:48 - 7:53)
200 people can come in and we can start (7:50 - 7:55)
eliminating those people wow so I'm glad (7:53 - 7:59)
in like 11 years of Pokemon we still (7:55 - 8:02)
have like registration issues (7:59 - 8:03)
it's incredible I was talking about this (8:02 - 8:05)
on the line with people because we saw (8:03 - 8:08)
how big of a line this was how how much (8:05 - 8:09)
more chaotic does this have to be before (8:08 - 8:12)
they decide to just split TCG and VG up (8:09 - 8:14)
into like separate lines no in separate (8:12 - 8:16)
venues at this point because just (8:14 - 8:19)
everything yeah like we had a hard time (8:16 - 8:21)
finding each other we spent almost 10 (8:19 - 8:22)
minutes just looking for each other and (8:21 - 8:24)
we're like oh we're by this we're by (8:22 - 8:25)
this we're buy this yeah there's so many (8:24 - 8:27)
people in that convention center it's (8:25 - 8:30)
ridiculous like well I feel like before (8:27 - 8:33)
it could have been more viable to have (8:30 - 8:35)
everybody together because if you didn't (8:33 - 8:37)
do very well in VGC you could do a bunch (8:35 - 8:39)
of the TCG side events but I feel like (8:37 - 8:44)
now in Year of Luigi 2023 we split up (8:39 - 8:48)
TCG and VGC so hard like people do not (8:44 - 8:50)
go and play the TCG side if they're (8:48 - 8:53)
playing the VGC side or maybe I'm just (8:50 - 8:55)
biased because that's exactly me (8:53 - 8:57)
do you find that there are people who (8:55 - 9:00)
play at tcg who also play VGC at these (8:57 - 9:02)
events I've played both I I have another (9:00 - 9:05)
good story TCG the thing you're asking (9:02 - 9:07)
BGC people that are TCG people I went to (9:05 - 9:11)
uh the national tournament uh (9:07 - 9:12)
would have been a year I think after (9:11 - 9:14)
black and white Steve's been around yeah (9:12 - 9:18)
and I'm I was still t i I did play VGC (9:14 - 9:19)
at that point and it was again it was (9:18 - 9:22)
the last chance to qualifier and I won (9:19 - 9:24)
my first match and then I got completely (9:22 - 9:26)
slammed my second match and I was (9:24 - 9:28)
eliminated and so I went over to play (9:26 - 9:30)
the pre-release of whatever set was (9:28 - 9:32)
coming out like emerging not emerging (9:30 - 9:33)
Powers but whatever came after that and (9:32 - 9:36)
while I was in line I was standing next (9:33 - 9:39)
to Mr Wolf Glick who was also okay I've (9:36 - 9:41)
heard of him um yeah you've probably (9:39 - 9:43)
heard of it and then we ended up (9:41 - 9:45)
battling each other in line as we waited (9:43 - 9:47)
to play the TCG because he's like oh you (9:45 - 9:48)
want to do a friendly battle uh and I (9:47 - 9:51)
beat him using a basket and a miraculous (9:48 - 9:54)
let me brush those holders this man beat (9:51 - 9:56)
a world championship you're the world (9:54 - 9:58)
champion now (9:56 - 10:00)
World Champ difference (9:58 - 10:02)
but at that time there were so many VGC (10:00 - 10:05)
people that would like just try it and (10:02 - 10:07)
it was fast and easy and then they would (10:05 - 10:08)
just like play TCG and I feel like (10:07 - 10:10)
you're right that doesn't that feels (10:08 - 10:12)
like that doesn't exist anymore because (10:10 - 10:14)
like I think it was easier just to get (10:12 - 10:16)
in or was like easier to like get a game (10:14 - 10:18)
where now it's like oh if you don't (10:16 - 10:20)
register beforehand sorry have a nice (10:18 - 10:22)
day or there's like a cost to it yeah (10:20 - 10:25)
when I got here there was no well back (10:22 - 10:27)
when I was when I beat wolf and I'm with (10:25 - 10:30)
the World Champ back in like 2011. you (10:27 - 10:32)
have to defend that time yeah (10:30 - 10:34)
um there was there was no cost to play (10:32 - 10:37)
VGC like you would just you would just (10:34 - 10:39)
stand in line register there was like (10:37 - 10:42)
100 people get in eventually yes and (10:39 - 10:44)
then you would just do it and I was when (10:42 - 10:46)
I first got here I ran my hotel to (10:44 - 10:48)
change and then to come over here and (10:46 - 10:49)
the guy in the elevator uh was like hey (10:48 - 10:50)
man you excited for tomorrow and I was (10:49 - 10:52)
like yeah yeah and he was like you (10:50 - 10:54)
playing and I was like it's eighty (10:52 - 10:56)
dollars (10:54 - 10:56)
I was like ten dollars to spectate I was (10:56 - 11:01)
like I wish but like I don't want to (10:59 - 11:03)
drop 80 to like (11:01 - 11:05)
lose two rounds and be like okay that's (11:03 - 11:08)
what I'm doing I'm doing that instead (11:05 - 11:12)
I'm dropping gas money after dropping a (11:08 - 11:16)
plane ticket he's dropped a lot more (11:12 - 11:16)
still coming (11:16 - 11:20)
also because I don't want to fully lose (11:18 - 11:24)
the Airbnb that I also dropped (11:20 - 11:25)
planning on paying you back but it's (11:24 - 11:26)
nice that you're coming we don't have to (11:25 - 11:27)
I think there's a good point there and (11:26 - 11:29)
it's like the barrier to entry to (11:27 - 11:32)
competitive Pokemon is like lower but (11:29 - 11:34)
then the cost of Entry is like high (11:32 - 11:37)
higher so it's true so even if it's like (11:34 - 11:38)
oh I want to go to this tournament it's (11:37 - 11:40)
in my even if it's like oh it's it's (11:38 - 11:42)
coming to Columbus I'm here and like you (11:40 - 11:44)
pay the 80 and register and then you get (11:42 - 11:45)
here and they're like okay I'm in this (11:44 - 11:47)
line for five hours and like I don't (11:45 - 11:48)
know where to go and like I can't even (11:47 - 11:50)
get into the Pokemon Center like it's (11:48 - 11:51)
not even like technical like today's (11:50 - 11:53)
like I would say technically Day Zero (11:51 - 11:55)
technically yeah and it's like Pokemon (11:53 - 11:57)
Center is already declining people (11:55 - 11:58)
you're stuck in line for like four to (11:57 - 12:00)
five hours only registrations for the (11:58 - 12:02)
Pokemon Center and what's funny is that (12:00 - 12:03)
I was in line for the Pokemon Center (12:02 - 12:05)
they have a queue for the queue for the (12:03 - 12:07)
queue to get in there's three lines you (12:05 - 12:08)
have to get into to get into the Pokemon (12:07 - 12:10)
Center and you need a prior reservation (12:08 - 12:12)
for it and they've sold out of backpacks (12:10 - 12:13)
they hit you with the triple Cube yeah (12:12 - 12:15)
the triple Cube I can imagine did you (12:13 - 12:17)
did you give me anything I (12:15 - 12:18)
um no (12:17 - 12:21)
I thought about it and then I saw the (12:18 - 12:22)
prices (12:21 - 12:24)
and I was like hopefully Mike can get in (12:22 - 12:26)
tomorrow (12:24 - 12:29)
I think there should be a good chance of (12:26 - 12:30)
getting in at some point during the (12:29 - 12:33)
weekend so not all the Hope Is Lost yeah (12:30 - 12:35)
yeah I'm sure but I I will say that with (12:33 - 12:38)
the the cost of Entry that's definitely (12:35 - 12:40)
a big thing Kevin and I uh over the past (12:38 - 12:43)
two years have really made like a big (12:40 - 12:45)
push to go and get out to these to these (12:43 - 12:47)
events (12:45 - 12:49)
um to the point where we've now had to (12:47 - 12:51)
start being a little bit more choosy (12:49 - 12:52)
which went with which ones we go to (12:51 - 12:55)
including things like worlds we were (12:52 - 12:56)
just going to be like all right yo let's (12:55 - 12:58)
just go to Worlds and just be there for (12:56 - 13:01)
for a week and now like when we look at (12:58 - 13:02)
the the reality of it it's like okay (13:01 - 13:05)
know that that costs a lot of money yes (13:02 - 13:09)
so uh maybe let's not do that one but uh (13:05 - 13:11)
and even for next year uh personally I'm (13:09 - 13:15)
I'm just aiming at the international uh (13:11 - 13:17)
competitions Kevin is looking at like (13:15 - 13:20)
the European International yeah I might (13:17 - 13:22)
go to a couple ICS I see is there where (13:20 - 13:24)
the real points are for like competitive (13:22 - 13:27)
Pokemon in general TCG go or VGC it's (13:24 - 13:29)
the the point distribution for (13:27 - 13:30)
international challenges night and day (13:29 - 13:32)
it's nearly double what a regional can (13:30 - 13:33)
give you so (13:32 - 13:36)
just run to the ICS (13:33 - 13:38)
just you know go to Australia let's go (13:36 - 13:40)
to Australia is fine that's like a (13:38 - 13:43)
20-hour playoff all right we've got a (13:40 - 13:45)
lot of scarlet and violet stuff going on (13:43 - 13:47)
this week but I before that just wanted (13:45 - 13:50)
to really Define what the differences (13:47 - 13:51)
between our channels are because there (13:50 - 13:53)
are a lot of things that I think people (13:51 - 13:55)
kind of go to one channel for go to (13:53 - 13:58)
another channel for uh when I look at (13:55 - 14:02)
the Pokemon cast YouTube channel you see (13:58 - 14:04)
lots of different stuff Steve what kind (14:02 - 14:06)
of stuff do you see over at the Pokemon (14:04 - 14:08)
cast YouTube channel what do I see on my (14:06 - 14:09)
own YouTube channel he doesn't know what (14:08 - 14:11)
do you see on your own YouTube it's all (14:09 - 14:12)
a Favorite Dream he doesn't know (14:11 - 14:16)
um it is a fewer dream uh (14:12 - 14:19)
you know I I put things up on my YouTube (14:16 - 14:21)
channel that I personally want myself (14:19 - 14:25)
like as a as a viewer like if I go and (14:21 - 14:26)
search something and it doesn't exist (14:25 - 14:28)
then I feel like I need to make it a (14:26 - 14:30)
really good example is like when Pokemon (14:28 - 14:33)
Crystal came out on the Virtual Console (14:30 - 14:36)
that was gosh that was like six years (14:33 - 14:38)
ago when that came out of the when that (14:36 - 14:39)
came out on Virtual Console everyone (14:38 - 14:41)
wanted to do like Gen 2 shiny breeding (14:39 - 14:44)
and every single guide out there was (14:41 - 14:46)
like okay first you gotta go into red (14:44 - 14:47)
and blue and you gotta use a shiny (14:46 - 14:49)
Gyarados and then trick it into a ditto (14:47 - 14:50)
and then you gotta move the ditto over (14:49 - 14:51)
and then you have a shiny Ditto and now (14:50 - 14:54)
you can breed like it was all that (14:51 - 14:56)
which is like (14:54 - 14:58)
once you get it you just spoke another (14:56 - 14:59)
language yeah like once you yeah I had (14:58 - 15:02)
no idea what you said like once you get (14:59 - 15:04)
it it makes shiny hunting easier and (15:02 - 15:07)
Crystal oh but no one was talking about (15:04 - 15:09)
how like why that actually worked like (15:07 - 15:11)
the number the zeros and the ones right (15:09 - 15:12)
like you don't actually need a shiny (15:11 - 15:16)
ditto it's just that like IV or in that (15:12 - 15:18)
game it was called DBS or different than (15:16 - 15:20)
IVs and this is how you could shiny Hunt (15:18 - 15:21)
without needing that ditto and that (15:20 - 15:23)
video didn't exist so I made it and (15:21 - 15:25)
that's usually like most of my content (15:23 - 15:28)
is me being curious enough to look up (15:25 - 15:29)
something and then being like oh it (15:28 - 15:30)
doesn't really exist or maybe it does (15:29 - 15:32)
exist but it's like kind of poorly (15:30 - 15:33)
explained so I'm just gonna make it (15:32 - 15:35)
someone wrote it on the Forum on page 52 (15:33 - 15:37)
let me make it a video yeah right like (15:35 - 15:38)
yeah (15:37 - 15:40)
um and sometimes those videos pop up and (15:38 - 15:41)
sometimes they don't uh and then in (15:40 - 15:43)
between like the consistency is like we (15:41 - 15:45)
drop our news podcast every single (15:43 - 15:46)
Monday and that's like General Pokemon (15:45 - 15:50)
news so Denver find it hard to stay to (15:46 - 15:52)
to keep that top of mind being like oh (15:50 - 15:55)
this isn't something that uh that this (15:52 - 15:56)
isn't something that's really no owner (15:55 - 15:58)
out there like I should make a video on (15:56 - 16:00)
that because I find that like I will (15:58 - 16:02)
come across something that I'll need to (16:00 - 16:04)
research but I never really think about (16:02 - 16:08)
like oh I can make content out of this I (16:04 - 16:09)
could be the one you could be the one (16:08 - 16:11)
that I could do the research I control (16:09 - 16:14)
history yeah so I'm not I'm not (16:11 - 16:16)
compelled enough to make (16:14 - 16:19)
like battle stuff because other people (16:16 - 16:21)
just do that better (16:19 - 16:23)
so it's like really easy like somebody (16:21 - 16:24)
can come into my like twitch chat and be (16:23 - 16:27)
like and ask questions about battling (16:24 - 16:29)
and I feel like I'm sufficient enough to (16:27 - 16:31)
answer that because I did coaching for (16:29 - 16:33)
so long and I Players Cup competitor (16:31 - 16:35)
right yeah I qualified for probably this (16:33 - 16:36)
cup and that was kind of cool (16:35 - 16:38)
um I beat wolf Glick I don't know if you (16:36 - 16:42)
guys know that so in line like you never (16:38 - 16:44)
saw it coming but if somebody wanted (16:42 - 16:47)
like a backlog of like okay I want to (16:44 - 16:49)
try different teams or I want to watch (16:47 - 16:50)
somebody play a team that you're not (16:49 - 16:52)
playing it's so easy for me to send them (16:50 - 16:54)
off to your guys's Channel or uh like (16:52 - 16:57)
Aaron Zhang or like Wolfie well Wolfie's (16:54 - 16:59)
channel is out all out of control right (16:57 - 17:02)
now like but like just like General team (16:59 - 17:03)
use it's like really easy for me to (17:02 - 17:04)
point to creators so like I don't need (17:03 - 17:05)
to like dip my toe in that because (17:04 - 17:07)
people already do it better (17:05 - 17:10)
um so that's what YouTube wise that's (17:07 - 17:12)
what I think of like can I make a video (17:10 - 17:14)
that either doesn't exist or can I make (17:12 - 17:16)
it better than somebody who's already (17:14 - 17:17)
done it (17:16 - 17:19)
um and then I go that route but I mean (17:17 - 17:21)
like my my bread and butter is just (17:19 - 17:24)
reporting on all Pokemon news which I've (17:21 - 17:28)
been doing for 10 plus years so yeah the (17:24 - 17:29)
thing that you do that I really like is (17:28 - 17:32)
the the max raid guides because I have (17:29 - 17:34)
no idea what Max raids are I do them (17:32 - 17:35)
sometimes but for me it's like oh I'm (17:34 - 17:38)
just gonna use a level 100 correct on (17:35 - 17:39)
and use Collision Course the whole time (17:38 - 17:41)
that's not actually optimal all the time (17:39 - 17:45)
Believe It or Not turns out yeah that's (17:41 - 17:46)
a that's an interesting thing too (17:45 - 17:49)
because like I felt like a bunch of (17:46 - 17:51)
content creators were very into (17:49 - 17:53)
Charizard and then after that they kind (17:51 - 17:56)
of just like dropped off whatever is the (17:53 - 17:58)
first one right yeah Charizard was the (17:56 - 18:00)
first one people like Charizard (17:58 - 18:03)
um and I feel like I'm still one of the (18:00 - 18:05)
only creators that are like making group (18:03 - 18:07)
based content because people do play (18:05 - 18:09)
this game with other people and then (18:07 - 18:10)
people complain that my videos like what (18:09 - 18:12)
about your solo builds and it's like (18:10 - 18:13)
there's so many other people doing solo (18:12 - 18:16)
builds like check them out they're cool (18:13 - 18:18)
um but yeah I make a lot of group based (18:16 - 18:19)
stuff what are your opinions on the (18:18 - 18:21)
Gimme ghoul situation of it not working (18:19 - 18:24)
for the first eight or seven hours do (18:21 - 18:25)
you know about this mic you might not (18:24 - 18:26)
know about this is working all week (18:25 - 18:30)
barely they released the the Gimme ghoul (18:26 - 18:32)
right so this gimme ghoul Max Terror (18:30 - 18:33)
raid has a chance of being shiny the (18:32 - 18:35)
only way you can get a shiny gimme ghoul (18:33 - 18:36)
ever okay problem is it doesn't work (18:35 - 18:39)
with shiny charm so it has like no (18:36 - 18:41)
increased odds it is the bare minimum (18:39 - 18:43)
odd chance that you can have to get a (18:41 - 18:45)
gaming goal not only that it looks (18:43 - 18:46)
nearly identical so it's nearly (18:45 - 18:48)
impossible to tell the difference and (18:46 - 18:51)
the first seven hours that it was out it (18:48 - 18:52)
wouldn't give you Rewards or it would (18:51 - 18:55)
just give you broken links bro yeah oh (18:52 - 18:59)
fun yeah I I spent a half hour ranting (18:55 - 19:02)
about this perfect do it again well like (18:59 - 19:04)
a chestnut broke so they they were (19:02 - 19:06)
supposed to release iron Tusk and or (19:04 - 19:08)
great Tuscan iron Treads and then (19:06 - 19:10)
Chestnut and then those all broke and (19:08 - 19:12)
then we didn't have raids for three (19:10 - 19:14)
weeks three weeks of no raids and then (19:12 - 19:16)
when the we finally got raids to come (19:14 - 19:18)
back it was Chestnut and (19:16 - 19:21)
iron Treads and gray test came back and (19:18 - 19:23)
then it was like gimme ghoul and then (19:21 - 19:25)
gimme ghouls yeah broken for like seven (19:23 - 19:26)
hours yeah what was funny about the (19:25 - 19:28)
gaming goal to be more specific it was (19:26 - 19:30)
only broken for scarlet players oh (19:28 - 19:32)
that's even funny come on (19:30 - 19:35)
if four Violet players joined a raid it (19:32 - 19:37)
worked perfectly but if it was three (19:35 - 19:38)
Violet players and one Scarlet player it (19:37 - 19:40)
would break for everyone oh geez so it's (19:38 - 19:43)
just Scarlet oh wow every Scarlet player (19:40 - 19:44)
got discriminated against for seven (19:43 - 19:46)
hours it's like sorry you play Scarlet (19:44 - 19:49)
stay over there yeah and then they yeah (19:46 - 19:52)
they fixed it that's not a it was not a (19:49 - 19:54)
particularly good or fun event (19:52 - 19:56)
like I I don't know what (19:54 - 19:58)
I don't know what they're thinking of (19:56 - 19:59)
like (19:58 - 20:01)
I don't know what they're thinking okay (19:59 - 20:03)
so it's it's full odds which is like (20:01 - 20:05)
whatever like one in four thousand isn't (20:03 - 20:07)
particularly great I think ideally what (20:05 - 20:08)
they probably want is like well if it's (20:07 - 20:11)
you and four friends it's technically (20:08 - 20:13)
maybe like you could argue it's one in a (20:11 - 20:14)
thousand because four different people (20:13 - 20:16)
are checking four different rate yeah (20:14 - 20:19)
yeah because if one person finds it the (20:16 - 20:21)
ideal is like they invite everyone to (20:19 - 20:23)
come to it and then everyone gets it (20:21 - 20:24)
together so I understand like the the (20:23 - 20:26)
place do you think that was intentional (20:24 - 20:29)
or do you think that they just this was (20:26 - 20:30)
an accident (20:29 - 20:32)
because others aren't like that right so (20:30 - 20:34)
Chinese shiny charm has never worked on (20:32 - 20:36)
raids oh even in Scarlet sword and (20:34 - 20:37)
shield that never worked on raids got it (20:36 - 20:39)
the difference is in sword and shield (20:37 - 20:41)
when they did monthly shiny raid events (20:39 - 20:43)
it was always like a one chance to (20:41 - 20:46)
increase yeah so this was still one in (20:43 - 20:48)
four which is kind of like they kind of (20:46 - 20:49)
like missed out on it being like one in (20:48 - 20:52)
999 like that's still kind of bad odds (20:49 - 20:54)
but like lore wise it would make sense (20:52 - 20:57)
yeah yeah it's the the special coin but (20:54 - 20:59)
also what's crazy is not only is the (20:57 - 21:01)
Gimme ghoul shiny terrible (20:59 - 21:04)
um in Pokemon home it's way better (21:01 - 21:06)
is it yeah so do you actually notice the (21:04 - 21:07)
difference yeah in Pokemon home he's (21:06 - 21:10)
like pure white uh the little gaming (21:07 - 21:11)
goal is pure white and then the golden (21:10 - 21:13)
go is still the same gold but it's all (21:11 - 21:16)
its rings around its body are green so (21:13 - 21:18)
it's green that's so much better than (21:16 - 21:19)
whatever it is it's like silver in the (21:18 - 21:21)
game right it's like yeah you can't see (21:19 - 21:23)
it in the game I don't know I'm team hey (21:21 - 21:26)
just make me a silver (21:23 - 21:26)
yeah heck I take bronze I'll make it (21:27 - 21:32)
green make it vomit green I'd take that (21:31 - 21:35)
this was our so like sword and shield (21:32 - 21:37)
had shiny events pretty much every month (21:35 - 21:38)
once a month it was like a Thursday (21:37 - 21:40)
Friday Saturday Sunday kind of thing and (21:38 - 21:42)
this game's been out for seven months (21:40 - 21:46)
first shiny event ever broke (21:42 - 21:49)
uh like way harder to check raid dense (21:46 - 21:50)
than Scarlet Violet just because it's an (21:49 - 21:52)
open world yeah not really intentional (21:50 - 21:53)
but open world makes it bigger to run (21:52 - 21:57)
from Den to den and then uh the The Raid (21:53 - 21:59)
doesn't even Sparkle so you have no clue (21:57 - 22:01)
it doesn't even go in so you just have (21:59 - 22:02)
to check everything yeah you just have (22:01 - 22:03)
to catch them all and then check (22:02 - 22:05)
afterwards oh geez so you have no clue (22:03 - 22:07)
like button sword and shield they did (22:05 - 22:09)
Sparkle (22:07 - 22:11)
they did Sparkle when they went in I (22:09 - 22:14)
don't know there's like there's like so (22:11 - 22:15)
many things I like about squirrel and (22:14 - 22:18)
violet and so many things that like just (22:15 - 22:20)
make really make you second guess right (22:18 - 22:22)
yeah like I still think going to the (22:20 - 22:24)
competitive thing the stadium and the (22:22 - 22:26)
people cheering and having like this (22:24 - 22:28)
huge crowd when you're playing (22:26 - 22:30)
was so good and now when you're playing (22:28 - 22:32)
scarlet and violet you're in like a (22:30 - 22:34)
schoolyard with Grandma like clapping (22:32 - 22:36)
behind where is proud Dad we need proud (22:34 - 22:39)
dad I have been saying this for months I (22:36 - 22:42)
miss proud dad with his artist across (22:39 - 22:45)
looking so supportively down at you from (22:42 - 22:47)
the rafters he was there for you he (22:45 - 22:49)
showed up I mean Grandma's hike in the (22:47 - 22:51)
schoolyard like she's out there for you (22:49 - 22:53)
I like her Grandma's got it I'm in (22:51 - 22:57)
Grandma's got energy Kevin you know what (22:53 - 23:01)
if if I uh lose out early at NAIC I will (22:57 - 23:03)
be your supportive grandma oh you'll be (23:01 - 23:05)
proud I will stand behind you just going (23:03 - 23:07)
like this the whole time and then (23:05 - 23:09)
probably for at least one game and then (23:07 - 23:10)
people find it weird and kick me out but (23:09 - 23:12)
it's fine (23:10 - 23:15)
I'm hype honestly any like ICS in (23:12 - 23:18)
general I guess you as a spectator for (23:15 - 23:19)
regionals I would never recommend (23:18 - 23:20)
spectating Regional that's just me (23:19 - 23:24)
personally it's just the stage is so (23:20 - 23:25)
close to the ground that you have 20 (23:24 - 23:26)
people all standing up just to see (23:25 - 23:29)
what's happening yeah at least with ICS (23:26 - 23:31)
they haven't let us into the venue but (23:29 - 23:32)
if it's anything like last year there's (23:31 - 23:35)
a giant you know a giant stage that's (23:32 - 23:36)
elevated from the ground the screens are (23:35 - 23:38)
actually elevated so that you can sit (23:36 - 23:40)
down and watch without hurting yourself (23:38 - 23:42)
well all the ICS that have been (23:40 - 23:44)
broadcasted have looked impressive I (23:42 - 23:45)
think because they're funded by Pokemon (23:44 - 23:48)
not like uh yeah outsourced by I've (23:45 - 23:50)
always I've always told people if you (23:48 - 23:52)
it's never worth traveling as a (23:50 - 23:54)
spectator to a regional (23:52 - 23:57)
correct but if it's in your city and (23:54 - 23:59)
it's like an hour or two away I would (23:57 - 24:00)
say it's worth going oh yeah but not (23:59 - 24:01)
like jumping on a flight for a reason (24:00 - 24:06)
time but in ic uh I I want to hopefully (24:01 - 24:07)
in four days I can say like yes it was (24:06 - 24:09)
worth traveling here as a spectator (24:07 - 24:11)
point I see although if I can't get in (24:09 - 24:13)
Pokemon Center or everything sold out in (24:11 - 24:15)
Pokemon Center by Friday like (24:13 - 24:17)
that isn't that is a draw to come to (24:15 - 24:19)
these the good news is uh they did say (24:17 - 24:21)
that they're capping how much they sell (24:19 - 24:23)
of certain items per day okay yeah so (24:21 - 24:26)
yeah that's really good so if they sell (24:23 - 24:27)
out of backpacks today they will have (24:26 - 24:29)
more tomorrow morning they have enough (24:27 - 24:32)
fresh restocks for each and every day oh (24:29 - 24:35)
so that world I went to in San Diego the (24:32 - 24:36)
black and white worlds flew out there (24:35 - 24:38)
for San Diego they had a Pokemon Center (24:36 - 24:41)
it was in it was in a like imagine your (24:38 - 24:45)
hotel room it was in a room that big I (24:41 - 24:47)
got it on plus she's on the bed I got in (24:45 - 24:49)
on Thursday night this is a real story I (24:47 - 24:52)
got I got it on Thursday night (24:49 - 24:54)
Pokemon Center open on Friday there was (24:52 - 24:56)
already a line because it was in the (24:54 - 24:58)
hotel of the convention center for the (24:56 - 25:00)
Pokemon Center when I woke up at 10 (24:58 - 25:01)
o'clock the next morning they were (25:00 - 25:03)
closed the entire weekend they were done (25:01 - 25:06)
they sold out of everything they only (25:03 - 25:07)

stuff this year yeah it looks really (25:24 - 25:28)
good like a lot of the they still have (25:26 - 25:29)
the side vendors here but a lot of side (25:28 - 25:30)
vendors will Jack up their prices (25:29 - 25:32)
because it comes from Japan or it you (25:30 - 25:34)
know it's it's a rare Pokemon well (25:32 - 25:37)
because they also spent retail price to (25:34 - 25:39)
get Fair exactly so they need to make a (25:37 - 25:40)
little bit of money yeah I haven't (25:39 - 25:42)
actually the thing is like I already (25:40 - 25:43)
went to the Pokemon Center today I spent (25:42 - 25:45)
100 like I don't need to look at vendors (25:43 - 25:47)

did this one (26:32 - 26:36)
um but the Nashville one the Pokemon (26:34 - 26:38)
Center was huge it had stuff all day but (26:36 - 26:40)
the backpack was sold out day one and I (26:38 - 26:42)
think they always are yeah I don't know (26:40 - 26:44)
why people love the backpacks I have so (26:42 - 26:46)
many backpacks in my life resale value I (26:44 - 26:48)
guess I don't know don't the competitors (26:46 - 26:50)
get a backpack though I didn't get a (26:48 - 26:52)
backpack I got a hat I tried to put on (26:50 - 26:54)
the table before maybe that's a maybe (26:52 - 26:55)
that's a world thing where if you (26:54 - 26:58)
qualify you get a backpack oh yeah yeah (26:55 - 27:01)
before that is Orlando I got a very nice (26:58 - 27:02)
tote bag (27:01 - 27:05)
or a drawstring bag you did but you did (27:02 - 27:07)
by accident yeah cause I got the VIP (27:05 - 27:08)
package oh did you accidentally have (27:07 - 27:11)
three package yeah I got an add-on I was (27:08 - 27:14)
like oh you know why not one in Rome it (27:11 - 27:15)
works yeah (27:14 - 27:17)
it worked but it was a nice bag it was (27:15 - 27:20)
it was a little drawstring bag I use it (27:17 - 27:22)
for other things now it's it's a nice (27:20 - 27:23)
little like pool bag use it for the (27:22 - 27:26)
event no no the other thing that they (27:23 - 27:28)
had it looks like because he said it was (27:26 - 27:30)
fossils a couple years back it's Evie (27:28 - 27:32)
this time that's the exact same thing as (27:30 - 27:35)
the UIC yeah I'm wearing one of the oh (27:32 - 27:36)
yeah he has the thing that yeah it's all (27:35 - 27:39)
EVS oh that's nice yeah to be fair the (27:36 - 27:40)
Pokemon company sent this to me I didn't (27:39 - 27:43)
pay for it (27:40 - 27:43)
FTC disclosure did not pay for this (27:43 - 27:48)
thing I am wearing (27:46 - 27:50)
um but yeah I I don't know if I would (27:48 - 27:52)
have bought this on my own because like (27:50 - 27:55)
I'm not a huge Evie fan yeah but like (27:52 - 27:57)
that fossil stuff was like right up my (27:55 - 27:59)
alley I was like skeleton Aerodactyl I'm (27:57 - 28:02)
in yes it's there like Tyrantrum he (27:59 - 28:04)
signed me up like a skeleton Charmander (28:02 - 28:07)
on my head not the one not the one it's (28:04 - 28:08)
cool that they go with like different (28:07 - 28:10)
themes like when I was in Nashville it (28:08 - 28:12)
was very like kaycona like everyone's (28:10 - 28:15)
holding like a banjo kind of thing and I (28:12 - 28:16)
was like I'm not really into this (28:15 - 28:18)
aesthetic I'm sure somebody is but like (28:16 - 28:20)
yeah yeah I don't need banjo stuff looks (28:18 - 28:22)
great though I can only imagine that's (28:20 - 28:24)
amazing absolutely that's what we're (28:22 - 28:25)
missing out on is like actual merch from (28:24 - 28:27)
Oklahoma Yokohama I have I have friends (28:25 - 28:30)
who are just going just to go and grab (28:27 - 28:31)
stuff and then they're gonna come back (28:30 - 28:33)
they're not going to be participating (28:31 - 28:34)
they're barely going to be spectating (28:33 - 28:36)
they're going to get what they can get (28:34 - 28:37)
and then get out well that's also (28:36 - 28:38)
another crazy situation because I've (28:37 - 28:41)
known people that they had their trip to (28:38 - 28:42)
Japan booked (28:41 - 28:44)
and then they announced that it was (28:42 - 28:46)
going to be a lottery system (28:44 - 28:49)
which like a lot of things in Japan are (28:46 - 28:52)
Lottery systems like games (28:49 - 28:54)
there's just so many people and because (28:52 - 28:56)
of scalpers I mean Pokemon go Fest did (28:54 - 28:58)
this for a couple years before where (28:56 - 28:59)
they just like it's a lottery to get a (28:58 - 29:01)
ticket to go Fest maybe you can explain (28:59 - 29:03)
this to me how does go Fest work what is (29:01 - 29:05)
stopping me from just going to the same (29:03 - 29:06)
park and walking around with my phone (29:05 - 29:08)
you can there just won't be any spawns (29:06 - 29:10)
oh nothing will spawn oh yeah your (29:08 - 29:12)
ticket game is in the game yes your (29:10 - 29:14)
ticket turns on the spawns and the (29:12 - 29:15)
pokestops (29:14 - 29:17)
and what happens at go Fest they have (29:15 - 29:18)
more spawns than normal I haven't played (29:17 - 29:20)
ghost since 2016 I'm sorry yeah so (29:18 - 29:21)
there's more spawns than normal there's (29:20 - 29:22)
more (29:21 - 29:24)
um stops than normal there's usually a (29:22 - 29:26)
quest line so like in Vegas there were (29:24 - 29:28)
nine pokestops that were Spinda specific (29:26 - 29:30)
so when you spun it a spindle would (29:28 - 29:33)
appear spinda's drunk okay you get it (29:30 - 29:34)
um which was really cool because people (29:33 - 29:36)
would be like I can't find like the (29:34 - 29:37)
ninth spin to stop and people like (29:36 - 29:39)
that's by the waterfall oh okay so that (29:37 - 29:41)
was cool the treasure hunt (29:39 - 29:43)
um so yeah there's like a quest line you (29:41 - 29:45)
can do usually there are bonuses (29:43 - 29:47)
um but yeah you you could walk around (29:45 - 29:48)
with your friend and you could turn on (29:47 - 29:50)
like an incense and things would spawn (29:48 - 29:51)
for you every like minute but you (29:50 - 29:53)
wouldn't be able to see all this yeah (29:51 - 29:54)
you wouldn't have the same experience as (29:53 - 29:56)
they would yeah and so um and then (29:54 - 29:58)
obviously they like bump the shiny rate (29:56 - 30:00)
up for players honestly that might be (29:58 - 30:02)
something to get me back in the go like (30:00 - 30:03)
I feel like go Fest does a great job in (30:02 - 30:05)
like trying to convince new people hey (30:03 - 30:06)
pick up this game again (30:05 - 30:09)
because I don't know it still has a huge (30:06 - 30:11)
audience I'm sure oh yeah yeah yeah I (30:09 - 30:12)
don't know if it's like 2016 numbers (30:11 - 30:14)
maybe there's a drop-off no idea I've (30:12 - 30:15)
never looked at the numbers but it (30:14 - 30:16)
dropped off for me so if there's (30:15 - 30:17)
anything that's going to make me want to (30:16 - 30:19)
play it again that'd be it I think the (30:17 - 30:22)
audience has shifted a bit uh it's it's (30:19 - 30:25)
gone away from the everybody wants to (30:22 - 30:27)
play every day all the time to now you (30:25 - 30:30)
have a very dedicated uh group of people (30:27 - 30:32)
who are not only willing to spend a lot (30:30 - 30:35)
of time but also (30:32 - 30:39)
money on things in game whereas before (30:35 - 30:42)
uh people weren't really wanting to (30:39 - 30:45)
spend a ton on this game I do know that (30:42 - 30:47)
Pokemon go makes a lot of money yeah I (30:45 - 30:49)
think as of this week they're top 10 in (30:47 - 30:51)
the Apple App Store again for top (30:49 - 30:53)
grossing because you went to Korea to do (30:51 - 30:55)
this thing right I did so how much is a (30:53 - 30:57)
go Fest ticket uh for gonna be like yeah (30:55 - 31:00)
I'm gonna go to go Fest Korea uh that (30:57 - 31:01)
was a safari zone so a little bit (31:00 - 31:03)
smaller than a go Fest okay so they have (31:01 - 31:05)
different like levels yeah so so (31:03 - 31:09)
regionals and I see he's got it correct (31:05 - 31:09)
actually only like 20 bucks oh that's (31:10 - 31:14)
not bad um and they've they've done they (31:11 - 31:16)
have add-ons like for for like this (31:14 - 31:20)
year's go Fest it was 25 but if you (31:16 - 31:21)
wanted like bonus raids that was like (31:20 - 31:23)
another 15 if you want a bonus like egg (31:21 - 31:25)
hatching stuff that was another 15. if (31:23 - 31:27)
you want the T-shirt that's a 20. the (31:25 - 31:30)
Niantic is mastered the like they they (31:27 - 31:32)
know let me add on some stuff but I (31:30 - 31:33)
think you're right like uh you know will (31:32 - 31:38)
and Greg who because the uh ISE (31:33 - 31:39)
um they usually only play on community (31:38 - 31:42)
days or big events like I play every day (31:39 - 31:44)
I don't like go hard every day but you (31:42 - 31:46)
spend a couple of hours just like yeah (31:44 - 31:49)
doing my dailies daily chores yeah (31:46 - 31:51)
um but yeah I think like for me it was (31:49 - 31:53)
it was worth it to go to Korea to do go (31:51 - 31:55)
fast Peak or not or not go for Safari (31:53 - 31:57)
Zone because (31:55 - 31:59)
um one I always wanted to go to Korea to (31:57 - 32:02)
like technically business expense (31:59 - 32:05)
hey Texas (32:02 - 32:07)
um but like I genuinely like Pokemon go (32:05 - 32:10)
so it was like you know if if I always (32:07 - 32:11)
like compare it to like your favorite (32:10 - 32:13)
musician like if somebody was like I (32:11 - 32:14)
love the Grateful Dead I don't know why (32:13 - 32:16)
I'm going with the Grateful Dead like (32:14 - 32:18)
they they might like fly out too because (32:16 - 32:21)
that's your favorite musician (32:18 - 32:23)
throw on fish afterwards (32:21 - 32:26)
um you know they they might fly out to (32:23 - 32:28)
you know Denver and then you know (32:26 - 32:30)
Seattle and then Austin Texas because (32:28 - 32:32)
they just want to keep seeing that band (32:30 - 32:35)
So for me that's like Pogo and like (32:32 - 32:37)
I obviously explored Korea and had a (32:35 - 32:39)
great time in Korea on top of that so I (32:37 - 32:40)
would probably need a new phone if I'm (32:39 - 32:42)
playing Pokemon go I still have a 10r I (32:40 - 32:45)
would I don't even know what a 10r is I (32:42 - 32:47)
I use it till I can't no more man (32:45 - 32:49)
the nice things about these events is (32:47 - 32:50)
there should be something Pokemon go (32:49 - 32:53)
related this weekend oh oh fair I could (32:50 - 32:56)
open it up once once I go O2 (32:53 - 32:58)
round two I just opened up Pokemon go (32:56 - 33:00)
yeah okay but it's been like that every (32:58 - 33:02)
time like we've we've always had (33:00 - 33:04)
something Pokemon go related to do I've (33:02 - 33:07)
never had a reason to do it though (33:04 - 33:10)
he's been winning too hard I don't know (33:07 - 33:12)
hopefully you don't lose but if you lose (33:10 - 33:13)
out and you're not doing anything on (33:12 - 33:15)
Saturday I'm playing hard sugar I might (33:13 - 33:17)
I might just lose yeah (33:15 - 33:18)
I plan to get like a bunch of people (33:17 - 33:20)
together and walk the city and play go (33:18 - 33:23)
oh heck yeah so this is a unique uh (33:20 - 33:26)
Internationals not only because it is (33:23 - 33:29)
the last one before worlds but also (33:26 - 33:33)
because we had a recent patch uh just (33:29 - 33:35)
before it and a lot of people out there (33:33 - 33:37)
are probably still needing to to go and (33:35 - 33:40)
uh update their games before they go and (33:37 - 33:42)
go and play this week they made us (33:40 - 33:45)
before we checked in did they yes oh (33:42 - 33:47)
okay so I guess I'm gonna do that before (33:45 - 33:48)
I leave them yeah you must (33:47 - 33:51)
it's a system update too I think a very (33:48 - 33:53)
uneventful system update yes there's (33:51 - 33:56)
nothing I will say that Pokemon patch (33:53 - 34:00)
1.3.2 uh did have a lot of changes not a (33:56 - 34:03)
lot given in easy to read places and a (34:00 - 34:04)
lot of them you had to kind of find all (34:03 - 34:07)
over the Internet like at home or just (34:04 - 34:10)
kind of in the data of the game the (34:07 - 34:14)
biggest change I think we've got three (34:10 - 34:15)
moves that are different now do you know (34:14 - 34:17)
those three moves Kevin we had three (34:15 - 34:19)
moves that are different oh yeah yeah I (34:17 - 34:20)
do because I have three moves that are (34:19 - 34:23)
different okay yeah he does but do you (34:20 - 34:24)
know what those are it's a dire claw and (34:23 - 34:26)
some other thing right they had the (34:24 - 34:28)
wrong thing yeah it's dire claw Stone ax (34:26 - 34:30)
and ceaseless Edge yeah I think in the (34:28 - 34:31)
game it said they had a high crit chance (34:30 - 34:33)
but they actually dumped so they just (34:31 - 34:37)
fixed it dang yeah but they fixed it in (34:33 - 34:39)
the other way wait what they were like (34:37 - 34:43)
okay uh we're not going to add the crit (34:39 - 34:45)
chance we're going to take away the text (34:43 - 34:46)
nothing at all yeah (34:45 - 34:49)
but I think originally it was it wasn't (34:46 - 34:51)
technically there to begin with is what (34:49 - 34:53)
they said no it was it was never coded (34:51 - 34:55)
in yeah yeah yeah so they were high crit (34:53 - 34:58)
in Legends Arceus oh yeah so that sounds (34:55 - 35:01)
like a copy and paste yeah yeah see they (34:59 - 35:03)
copy and pasted the text they didn't (35:01 - 35:04)
copy and paste the shiny animation from (35:03 - 35:06)
I'm happy that they actually took the (35:04 - 35:08)
time to like look at Legends arsons be (35:06 - 35:09)
like yeah we can't give Cresselia (35:08 - 35:12)
minimize that's not okay like yeah (35:09 - 35:14)
they're like let's change some of these (35:12 - 35:16)
well assuming this is the decidueye had (35:14 - 35:19)
Focus energy in Legends and they took (35:16 - 35:21)
that away and Scarlet and violet now (35:19 - 35:23)
that that would have changed it would (35:21 - 35:24)
have made him a good raid Pokemon yeah (35:23 - 35:27)
good for raids (35:24 - 35:29)
can I tell you the biggest buff that (35:27 - 35:33)

do before nothing oh absolutely nothing (36:02 - 36:07)
uh well okay so outside of that out of (36:05 - 36:10)
battle illuminate would um help you find (36:07 - 36:12)

watch out glow has (37:07 - 37:12)
okay because he's watching he's watching (37:09 - 37:15)
uh you've got shinanic and moral low (37:12 - 37:17)
shine nautic where does that oh okay (37:15 - 37:20)
mushrooms yeah yeah okay I get it yeah (37:17 - 37:22)
the glowy mushrooms yeah yeah you didn't (37:20 - 37:23)
watch the animals ones are from like (37:22 - 37:25)
light up the oh I didn't watch anime (37:23 - 37:28)
episode number 897 (37:25 - 37:28)
you probably called the exact number (37:29 - 37:33)
it's actually like for in press because (37:31 - 37:35)
like 897 is actually like sun and moon (37:33 - 37:37)
in there you're probably pretty close (37:35 - 37:41)
yeah uh the last two are Staryu and (37:37 - 37:43)
Starmie I guess that makes sense okay (37:41 - 37:45)
they're gems yeah (37:43 - 37:47)
but like you know you would just use (37:45 - 37:49)
natural cure every single time yeah (37:47 - 37:50)
because it wouldn't do anything before (37:49 - 37:52)
but now you don't have to now you have (37:50 - 37:54)
options and that's what's cool about (37:52 - 37:56)
people (37:54 - 37:58)
why did they make that decision what in (37:56 - 38:00)
the game is currently around that lowers (37:58 - 38:02)
accuracy that we need to care about I (38:00 - 38:06)
couldn't tell you the the one one of the (38:02 - 38:08)
bad changes of scarlet and violet is (38:06 - 38:10)
there were uh in in ever since like I (38:08 - 38:12)
think like gen 3 there were abilities (38:10 - 38:14)
that did work in the Overworld (38:12 - 38:16)
so if you had like a Pokemon if you had (38:14 - 38:17)
astronaut at the front of your party it (38:16 - 38:18)
would increase water encounters for you (38:17 - 38:21)
oh really um and then if you had like uh (38:18 - 38:22)
obviously like if you had flash fire in (38:21 - 38:24)
your party it would hatch eggs faster I (38:22 - 38:25)
knew that um and then if you had like (38:24 - 38:27)
super luck in your party it would be 50 (38:25 - 38:29)
more likely the Pokemon would be holding (38:27 - 38:32)
a held item when you encounter it so (38:29 - 38:33)
there was like right this is blowing my (38:32 - 38:35)
mind a bunch of ability like magnet pole (38:33 - 38:37)
would be like steel Pokemon there was a (38:35 - 38:38)
bunch of abilities like illuminate that (38:37 - 38:39)
would work (38:38 - 38:40)
and all those abilities do something in (38:39 - 38:43)
battle except for Illuminating so (38:40 - 38:45)
they're like I do something eliminate is (38:43 - 38:47)
useless outside of battle now because we (38:45 - 38:48)
got rid of all of that in scarling (38:47 - 38:50)
Violet and in battle so I guess that (38:48 - 38:52)
would be like the only reason there are (38:50 - 38:53)
a lot of useless abilities though I (38:52 - 38:56)
would have loved to be in the in the dev (38:53 - 38:59)
office during them figuring out that (38:56 - 39:00)
they need to fix illuminate where (38:59 - 39:03)
they're like all right patch patch 1.3.2 (39:00 - 39:05)
we've got this change this change we're (39:03 - 39:08)
fixing raid dens a little bit uh what (39:05 - 39:11)
else can we put in with this patch some (39:08 - 39:12)
guy in the back's like hey remember (39:11 - 39:14)
remember illuminate oh really kind of (39:12 - 39:16)
weird that does nothing right there's (39:14 - 39:18)
some Pokemon that make absolutely no (39:16 - 39:20)
sense like what is it Deli bird has two (39:18 - 39:22)
abilities that do the exact same thing (39:20 - 39:24)
it's like uh insomnia and vital Spirit (39:22 - 39:27)
they're literally identical those are (39:24 - 39:28)
the two abilities it gets they're really (39:27 - 39:30)
trying to hit home the theme oh speaking (39:28 - 39:32)
did you watch I don't know if Mike's (39:30 - 39:34)
been away all week did you watch the the (39:32 - 39:36)
DLC trailer I did watch the DLC trailer (39:34 - 39:38)
okay ignore the DLC trailer did you (39:36 - 39:40)
watch the detective Pikachu trailer I (39:38 - 39:42)
did not watch the detective Pikachu (39:40 - 39:44)
Pokemon (39:42 - 39:46)
there was a voice acting in the 3DS (39:44 - 39:48)
version six years ago well there's voice (39:46 - 39:49)
acting in Pokemon again (39:48 - 39:52)
[Laughter] (39:49 - 39:55)
it was so nice they did it twice okay so (39:52 - 39:57)
are you are you excited for this (39:55 - 39:58)
detective honestly I never played the (39:57 - 39:59)
first one (39:58 - 40:01)
um I don't know why it might have been (39:59 - 40:02)
the time that I was playing do you think (40:01 - 40:04)
more people will now that the movie is (40:02 - 40:07)
is a thing well the the eShop is closed (40:04 - 40:10)
so uh so yeah you can't get the old one (40:07 - 40:12)
so unless you buy was that eShop only or (40:10 - 40:13)
can you not have the physical you could (40:12 - 40:14)
have the physical but like stores (40:13 - 40:16)
stopped carrying 3DS games so you're (40:14 - 40:17)
paying eBay prices yeah you're paying (40:16 - 40:19)
eBay prices which I I think it's only (40:17 - 40:21)
like 50 bucks used so like ten dollars (40:19 - 40:23)
more than (40:21 - 40:25)
I'm I'm gonna assume okay that they put (40:23 - 40:29)
like a synopsis slash here's where we (40:25 - 40:30)
left off because it is an actual sequel (40:29 - 40:33)
right it's yeah the first one has the (40:30 - 40:35)
worst Cliffhanger ever I heard you (40:33 - 40:36)
talking about a little bit on your (40:35 - 40:37)
podcast yeah (40:36 - 40:38)
I mean if you saw the movie you kind of (40:37 - 40:40)
get the gist of the whole thing the (40:38 - 40:42)
movie has a ending are we giving a (40:40 - 40:43)
spoiler warning (40:42 - 40:45)
no this was six years ago this was six (40:43 - 40:47)
years this is also the house I feel like (40:45 - 40:48)
most people have probably seen the movie (40:47 - 40:50)
and if you haven't seen the movie by now (40:48 - 40:53)
Pikachu's the dad guys yeah you're (40:50 - 40:55)
welcome (40:53 - 40:58)
what that's the terrible part about the (40:55 - 41:00)
first game is they never reveal that oh (40:58 - 41:04)
that's stupid oh well this time (41:00 - 41:06)
yeah is it implied (41:04 - 41:08)
kind of I think is it implied in the (41:06 - 41:10)
game (41:08 - 41:12)
in in the way of like (41:10 - 41:15)
you know that like Spider-Man is gonna (41:12 - 41:18)
win at the end of a movie or like it's (41:15 - 41:19)
like that like it's like duh it's like (41:18 - 41:22)
that implied but if if oh the (41:19 - 41:24)
protagonist doesn't die weird but they (41:22 - 41:27)
they don't ever come out and say Pikachu (41:24 - 41:30)
is the dad ever they pretty much like at (41:27 - 41:31)
the point of the game where you're like (41:30 - 41:33)
okay this is the ending Pikachu's gonna (41:31 - 41:35)
turn back into the dad (41:33 - 41:36)
um which obviously the movie confirms (41:35 - 41:39)
that if that wasn't clear (41:36 - 41:41)
um Mewtwo's like well I can do the one (41:39 - 41:43)
thing you want which they don't say (41:41 - 41:45)
which is the dad or you can do one more (41:43 - 41:47)
mission for me and then Pikachu comes (41:45 - 41:49)
around the corner and he's like we got (41:47 - 41:51)
another mission and it was like so the (41:49 - 41:52)
kid never finds out he never finds out (41:51 - 41:54)
yeah so the kid is so clueless that (41:52 - 41:56)
Pikachu is his dad and it's so obvious (41:54 - 41:57)
to the audience right it's like they (41:56 - 41:59)
call they use the coffee right like the (41:57 - 42:01)
Pikachu likes coffee dad likes coffee (41:59 - 42:04)
yep yep yep okay so they hinted that is (42:01 - 42:07)
a great detective Pikachu yeah yeah (42:04 - 42:10)
so we do we ever find out like how (42:07 - 42:13)
how Pikachu became the dad or the dad (42:10 - 42:15)
became the Pikachu Mewtwo did it but (42:13 - 42:17)
YouTube just chose a random man on the (42:15 - 42:20)
street it was just like no Mewtwo did it (42:17 - 42:24)
to save them right yes like someone was (42:20 - 42:27)
in a car crash or something yes but I (42:24 - 42:28)
don't think there was ever a car crash (42:27 - 42:29)
revealed in the game (42:28 - 42:31)
oh that was a movie thing okay yeah that (42:29 - 42:32)
was a movie thing they just wanted (42:31 - 42:34)
Michael Bay I get it but it's very clear (42:32 - 42:35)
at the end of the game that Mewtwo was (42:34 - 42:37)
could turn Pikachu back into the dab I (42:35 - 42:39)
guess I just wanted Mewtwo's powers that (42:37 - 42:40)
no one knew about correct yeah yeah (42:39 - 42:42)
Mitchell can do anything yeah guys like (42:40 - 42:43)
that's what I'm saying we're all (42:42 - 42:46)
sleeping on Mewtwo I mean he was made by (42:43 - 42:48)
we were talking about soul galio and and (42:46 - 42:51)
lunala like forget all of those (42:48 - 42:53)
legendaries let's let's bring back (42:51 - 42:56)
Mewtwo he was that was like the (42:53 - 42:59)
Pokemon you got you ever realize how the (42:56 - 43:00)
legendaries have got this generation (42:59 - 43:03)
like oh yeah they're bikes yeah the cars (43:00 - 43:05)
they make they make it sun and then put (43:03 - 43:07)
electricity on the field they don't they (43:05 - 43:08)
don't shatter space time they don't (43:07 - 43:10)
create Pokemon they don't change Pokemon (43:08 - 43:11)
into humans and humans into Pokemon (43:10 - 43:14)
they're bikes (43:11 - 43:17)
they don't talk nah they don't they (43:14 - 43:19)
barely emote they eat sandwiches they (43:17 - 43:21)
like sandwiches they definitely love (43:19 - 43:23)
those things Can't Get Enough can we (43:21 - 43:26)
talk about how there's just for two (43:23 - 43:28)
seconds there's no racing in scarlet and (43:26 - 43:30)
violet oh yeah wow (43:28 - 43:31)
because there wasn't enough frames to do (43:30 - 43:33)
it (43:31 - 43:35)
you made a motorcycle Pokemon with no (43:33 - 43:37)
racing we have more soccer than we have (43:35 - 43:40)
racing like like it started chilled (43:37 - 43:41)
there was a racing minigame you would go (43:40 - 43:43)
from one end of the wild area to the (43:41 - 43:44)
other on your bike (43:43 - 43:47)
yeah and then it would like time you and (43:44 - 43:48)
then you could do it over and over to (43:47 - 43:50)
beat your like high score (43:48 - 43:52)
there's nothing you can slide down the (43:50 - 43:54)
hill right and you can fall through the (43:52 - 43:56)
floor too sometimes (43:54 - 43:59)
love that and this game does this cool (43:56 - 44:01)
thing where it's like turns black and (43:59 - 44:03)
then starts over and this game does this (44:01 - 44:05)
nice thing where it closes my game and (44:03 - 44:07)
shows me other games that I could be (44:05 - 44:09)
playing speak of the DLC since we (44:07 - 44:11)
weren't talking about it all you ever (44:09 - 44:12)
notice how it's called Hidden Treasures (44:11 - 44:14)
of area zero but so far the two (44:12 - 44:17)
locations are not an area zero correct (44:14 - 44:19)
yeah (44:17 - 44:20)
I don't know how they're gonna tie that (44:19 - 44:23)
back together I'm curious because one is (44:20 - 44:24)
in the mountain that we can't access (44:23 - 44:27)
right that's I'm assuming the first one (44:24 - 44:28)
where we're going to the Japanese (44:27 - 44:30)
inspired right and the other one's in (44:28 - 44:33)
the middle of the ocean and underwater (44:30 - 44:34)
oh that's what you're missing oh there's (44:33 - 44:36)
a terrarium underwater I'm like oh (44:34 - 44:39)
that's a blueberry Academy really yeah (44:36 - 44:40)
yeah (44:39 - 44:43)
they built a like it's a giant terrarium (44:40 - 44:45)
I think it's just their excuse to give (44:43 - 44:46)
us different locations with different (44:45 - 44:49)
Pokemon I kind of like it I like down (44:46 - 44:51)
for it I (44:49 - 44:51)
like double battles are ever shown into (44:51 - 44:55)
Scarlet Violet video yes did you notice (44:53 - 44:57)
that through the whole game there was (44:55 - 44:58)
not a single double battle except for (44:57 - 45:00)
like that one gym just the that one (44:58 - 45:02)
single gym leader yeah I even think her (45:00 - 45:04)
did her minions even do double battles (45:02 - 45:06)
they might I think they might they I (45:04 - 45:08)
think the minions did but that was like (45:06 - 45:11)
the world's easiest gym yeah (45:08 - 45:12)
it was the ghost one (45:11 - 45:14)
the rapping lady okay you remember the (45:12 - 45:16)
one where the the dog hops up on the (45:14 - 45:18)
speakers (45:16 - 45:21)
that's the best part yeah they spend (45:18 - 45:22)
time with that big highlight yeah I'm (45:21 - 45:24)
okay with falling into the floor to see (45:22 - 45:26)
that dog dance (45:24 - 45:26)
fell through the floor I landed in the (45:26 - 45:31)
gym leaders uh area (45:29 - 45:35)
um the other thing that we got the other (45:31 - 45:39)
day we got Pokemon sleep news folks here (45:35 - 45:42)
we go Pokemon sleepwatch I didn't even (45:39 - 45:44)
know that well there is a little short (45:42 - 45:48)
uh it's Japanese only it's about Snorlax (45:44 - 45:50)
oh is that you can still watch it on (45:48 - 45:52)
YouTube right now yeah that makes sense (45:50 - 45:55)
it's Pokemon it's Pikachu lying on top (45:52 - 45:58)
of Snorlax Snorlax is asleep and it's (45:55 - 46:00)
just like a narrator calmly talking over (45:58 - 46:02)
the Snorlax like think of a of a (46:00 - 46:04)
headspace kind of thing like a (46:02 - 46:07)
meditation uh situation with just a (46:04 - 46:10)
Snorlax trying to sleep and it's it's a (46:07 - 46:14)
nothing video but what it is is the (46:10 - 46:16)
kickoff for marketing of Pokemon sleep (46:14 - 46:19)
which is the most hype thing that I've (46:16 - 46:20)
ever seen they've been working on this (46:19 - 46:21)
game for how long is it just a sleep (46:20 - 46:24)
tracker uh yes yeah probably so the (46:21 - 46:25)
people who are making Pokemon sleep if (46:24 - 46:27)
you don't know this made Magikarp jump (46:25 - 46:30)
um and the best game ever the go plus (46:27 - 46:31)
plus which is the thing you're supposed (46:30 - 46:33)
to put under your pillow to help track (46:31 - 46:34)
the sleep you don't need it I think you (46:33 - 46:35)
can just put your phone under your (46:34 - 46:36)
pillow too but if you want the little (46:35 - 46:38)
plus plus thing that's supposed to come (46:36 - 46:41)
out I think on July 15th so assumptions (46:38 - 46:43)
that sleep is what's that button that's (46:41 - 46:45)
yeah like a hundred dollars yeah yeah (46:43 - 46:47)
assumptions that sleep is mid-july and (46:45 - 46:48)
then that's also supposed to work with (46:47 - 46:50)
Pokemon go the interesting thing that I (46:48 - 46:51)
I think (46:50 - 46:54)
I just find ironic or maybe funny is (46:51 - 46:54)
people (46:54 - 46:55)
[Music] (46:54 - 46:57)
complain so much that Pokemon go is like (46:55 - 46:59)
selling your data even though Niantic (46:57 - 47:01)
has come out multiple times saying like (46:59 - 47:03)
yes we know how many pokestops you're (47:01 - 47:05)
spinning but like we're not like saying (47:03 - 47:05)
like (47:05 - 47:07)
I feel like it's just mostly legal (47:05 - 47:09)
reasons they have to say that right it's (47:07 - 47:11)
like we didn't see you go to like Target (47:09 - 47:12)
three times and we're selling that back (47:11 - 47:13)
to Target (47:12 - 47:14)
but like whether or not you care about (47:13 - 47:16)
Niantic selling your data or gathering (47:14 - 47:19)
your data in a location-based game like (47:16 - 47:21)
Pokemon sleep is going to know your (47:19 - 47:23)
sleep patterns yeah they're going to (47:21 - 47:25)
problems like I feel like that is way (47:23 - 47:27)
more personal than oh yeah okay we know (47:25 - 47:30)
like 20 000 people went to Mall of (47:27 - 47:31)
America this weekend yeah (47:30 - 47:34)
we know Steve was up until 3am making a (47:31 - 47:37)
thumbnail yeah yeah yeah yeah (47:34 - 47:37)
so like I'm just curious same energy (47:37 - 47:42)
when it comes to like (47:40 - 47:44)
I don't want Niantic selling my data but (47:42 - 47:46)
like I'm okay with (47:44 - 47:49)
us like sleep having my data I don't (47:46 - 47:51)
know Health Data to me sounds (47:49 - 47:53)
more price more of a red flag than (47:51 - 47:55)
incredibly personal yeah yeah it's (47:53 - 47:57)
personal and if you're okay with that (47:55 - 47:59)
that's cool like I don't know I guess (47:57 - 48:01)
I'm okay with Pikachu knowing that I (47:59 - 48:05)
have the worst sleep schedule yeah (48:01 - 48:06)
I'm just curious like what they're gonna (48:05 - 48:07)
do with all that data because like I (48:06 - 48:08)
feel like (48:07 - 48:11)
that is a hard thing to track or to (48:08 - 48:13)
communicate back to people I mean I do (48:11 - 48:16)
that already kind of I do wear my like (48:13 - 48:18)
pixel watch to sleep so that I can see (48:16 - 48:21)
how long I've I was in rem for and how (48:18 - 48:24)
long I actually slept and mostly all it (48:21 - 48:27)
all it accomplishes is a little bit of (48:24 - 48:29)
depression where I'm like oh I I slept (48:27 - 48:31)
for three hours last night yeah but you (48:29 - 48:32)
don't need your watch to tell you that (48:31 - 48:33)
you know (48:32 - 48:36)
yeah yeah right but now I have like a (48:33 - 48:38)
little I have a number (48:36 - 48:40)
like I I have you sleep apps in the past (48:38 - 48:43)

deal for more Pokemon stuff because (50:25 - 50:30)
Pokemon on Netflix is like top 10 in (50:28 - 50:32)
like kids and family it's like (50:30 - 50:35)
consistently one of the most watched (50:32 - 50:37)
animation I should say animation because (50:35 - 50:39)
I think it also appears under like you (50:37 - 50:41)
know next to like animations yeah next (50:39 - 50:43)
to like death note it's in like this (50:41 - 50:45)
yeah (50:43 - 50:48)
that's hilarious that it's definitely (50:45 - 50:51)
all of the Indigo League on it like how (50:48 - 50:54)
much of the library do they have they (50:51 - 50:56)
have some of the old stuff but it's like (50:54 - 50:57)
mostly new that mostly new like the (50:56 - 50:59)
master Journeys and then the master (50:57 - 51:01)
quest which (50:59 - 51:03)
um I like sassy Ash (51:01 - 51:05)
I like Indigo League she's funny yeah (51:03 - 51:09)
but yeah I'm I'm assuming the new one (51:05 - 51:11)
will come to Netflix with the girl I (51:09 - 51:13)
can't I don't know her yeah liko yeah (51:11 - 51:14)
something (51:13 - 51:15)
I've actually believe it or not I've (51:14 - 51:17)
watched like the first three episodes of (51:15 - 51:19)
the Japanese anime it's not bad I like (51:17 - 51:20)
it (51:19 - 51:22)
Pokemon battles have gotten like because (51:20 - 51:24)
I've only watched all of the Indigo (51:22 - 51:27)
League then nothing and then episode 980 (51:24 - 51:30)
yeah yeah for the moral on it and then (51:27 - 51:33)
I've watched the last three Pokemon (51:30 - 51:35)
battles have gotten a lot better like (51:33 - 51:37)
they're actually animated incredibly (51:35 - 51:38)
well (51:37 - 51:41)
well they just added like a week ago the (51:38 - 51:44)
champion stuff so like Leo and Ash and (51:41 - 51:45)
like all the battles up to that point (51:44 - 51:47)
which I heard all of those battles are (51:45 - 51:48)
animated amazingly and it's like Eight (51:47 - 51:50)
Episodes so I think we know that's (51:48 - 51:51)
awesome I'm gonna go through all of that (51:50 - 51:53)
I don't need filler of Ash catching (51:51 - 51:55)
point I just want to see him battle (51:53 - 51:57)
but actually though yeah yeah I think if (51:55 - 52:00)
I could just see all those battles just (51:57 - 52:02)
sequentially that would be nice I'm sure (52:00 - 52:04)
there's there's a watch guide out there (52:02 - 52:06)
somewhere (52:04 - 52:06)
with the anime watching Japanese is (52:10 - 52:13)
great I've heard a lot of the Japanese (52:12 - 52:16)
Pokemon cries was amazing like uh what (52:13 - 52:18)
is it uh (52:16 - 52:18)
[Laughter] (52:21 - 52:26)
uh so then the last little bit that I've (52:22 - 52:28)
got here so we've got Road what's that (52:26 - 52:29)
you still have a seven hour drive (52:28 - 52:31)
already still sleeping (52:29 - 52:35)
what time you wake up today bud huh wake (52:31 - 52:37)
up you have to go to sleep to wake up (52:35 - 52:41)
I'll tell you when I do that uh road to (52:37 - 52:43)
Worlds is a docu-series that has been (52:41 - 52:44)
coming up in the past couple of days (52:43 - 52:46)
Kevin have you heard of road to Worlds (52:44 - 52:48)
I've heard of it I I saw a lot of photos (52:46 - 52:49)
on Twitter if everyone be like hey look (52:48 - 52:51)
there I am and it's like as far back (52:49 - 52:53)
away you know that SpongeBob Meme where (52:51 - 52:55)
it's like they'd make the commercial and (52:53 - 52:56)
then SpongeBob's little hat goes through (52:55 - 52:58)
the window he's like look there I am (52:56 - 52:59)
that's what everyone was doing on (52:58 - 53:01)
Twitter uh Steve you had a chance to (52:59 - 53:03)
watch the road to Worlds DocuSign no I (53:01 - 53:05)
haven't watched it fully I've seen like (53:03 - 53:06)
30 seconds here and there from like (53:05 - 53:09)
Instagram or Twitter or whatnot um it's (53:06 - 53:11)
cool that they're doing that I think (53:09 - 53:15)
uh like a couple years ago a big problem (53:11 - 53:19)
with like watching competitive stuff is (53:15 - 53:20)
that like (53:19 - 53:23)
you it was hard to be like I want this (53:20 - 53:26)
person to win or I want this person to (53:23 - 53:29)
win so like having I mean I think back (53:26 - 53:31)
in the day like so many people were (53:29 - 53:32)
behind Roy Rizzo just because he had (53:31 - 53:34)
like an American flag and that was it (53:32 - 53:36)
like I don't know anything about him but (53:34 - 53:37)
he's America and the other people are (53:36 - 53:39)
not America so I guess we're gonna vote (53:37 - 53:42)
like root for Ray Rizzo I guess (53:39 - 53:46)
um so I I do like that in recent (53:42 - 53:49)
regionals and ICS that they do take the (53:46 - 53:51)
time to like talk to these players and (53:49 - 53:54)
to like kind of develop this thing I (53:51 - 53:56)
mean we talked about Wolfie already but (53:54 - 53:57)
like sometimes it's really annoying to (53:56 - 53:58)
like (53:57 - 54:02)
have Wolfie Fanboys spam twitch chat of (53:58 - 54:03)
like where's Wolfie where's Wolfie word (54:02 - 54:04)
and it's like just look at his Twitter (54:03 - 54:06)
he lost like yeah three hours ago yeah (54:04 - 54:09)
they're not he's gone (54:06 - 54:12)
but but at the same time it's like it's (54:09 - 54:14)
cool to see that like people are (54:12 - 54:16)
invested in him as a player there needs (54:14 - 54:17)
to be fans I think if there's any chance (54:16 - 54:19)
of this growing as an esport there needs (54:17 - 54:20)
to be (54:19 - 54:23)
the players need to be more than players (54:20 - 54:24)
right it's almost like the players (54:23 - 54:27)
become celebrities at that point (54:24 - 54:29)
yeah uh or like somebody you can look (54:27 - 54:31)
forward to like you know like one of my (54:29 - 54:33)
favorite people to watch is Joe ux9 so (54:31 - 54:35)
it's like if if I'm like cleaning my (54:33 - 54:36)
house and it's like oh Joe's match is (54:35 - 54:38)
coming up like I'm gonna stop what I'm (54:36 - 54:40)
doing he's like I wanted I want to see (54:38 - 54:43)
Joe while I win and we have all seen Joe (54:40 - 54:45)
get to second place (54:43 - 54:49)
the finally one yeah yeah (54:45 - 54:51)
uh so essentially what what road the (54:49 - 54:54)
worlds is doing is it's following a few (54:51 - 54:56)
different people I think four or five (54:54 - 54:58)
different people uh just as they go (54:56 - 55:00)
through like their prep and their their (54:58 - 55:03)
battles and their their what have you (55:00 - 55:05)
but each episode is like almost half an (55:03 - 55:08)
hour long I know that there are a lot of (55:05 - 55:10)
like short things on on the social (55:08 - 55:13)
medias but uh yeah on YouTube on the (55:10 - 55:14)
official Pokemon Channel they're (55:13 - 55:17)
dropping these like half hour long (55:14 - 55:20)
docu-series is about these different (55:17 - 55:21)
people some people have Masters some (55:20 - 55:23)
people in seniors people who are young (55:21 - 55:26)
to Masters people who are old to old to (55:23 - 55:28)
uh Masters because that's like really (55:26 - 55:31)
what Masters encompasses is like a (55:28 - 55:34)
really wide age range compared to like (55:31 - 55:36)
the seniors who's just like what 15 16. (55:34 - 55:39)
Edge Lord age the the most recent one is (55:36 - 55:42)
like really giving an Underdog Story to (55:39 - 55:44)
Isaiah bradner (55:42 - 55:48)
um who is a very uh competent player in (55:44 - 55:51)
in in Pokemon it's pretty good and it's (55:48 - 55:53)
kind of making me feel like I kind of (55:51 - 55:54)
root for this guy like I'm about to play (55:53 - 55:57)
against him potentially and I'm like I (55:54 - 55:59)
hope he wins (55:57 - 56:04)
yeah I I I'm curious I know a couple (55:59 - 56:05)
people that work at the Pokemon company (56:04 - 56:08)
and yeah Pokemon company International (56:05 - 56:10)
sorry and I know there are a lot of them (56:08 - 56:13)
that are big wrestling fans and this is (56:10 - 56:15)
something that happens in WWE in (56:13 - 56:17)
wrestling where they do like this like (56:15 - 56:19)
this was everything leading up to your (56:17 - 56:21)
your big match or like this was like the (56:19 - 56:23)
behind the scenes of like this big event (56:21 - 56:24)
do that a lot on pay-per-views too yeah (56:23 - 56:26)
and I wouldn't be surprised if they were (56:24 - 56:27)
like (56:26 - 56:29)
watching WrestleMania and then they had (56:27 - 56:31)
like the after show of WrestleMania like (56:29 - 56:32)
this was this wrestler's journey and (56:31 - 56:33)
they're like we should do that for (56:32 - 56:35)
Pokemon it's like yeah you should do (56:33 - 56:37)
that for Pokemon because like yeah give (56:35 - 56:38)
people a reason why they're seeing this (56:37 - 56:41)
fight or this battle right now yeah this (56:38 - 56:43)
is when two people are going against (56:41 - 56:45)
each other what how many times have they (56:43 - 56:47)
followed each other in the past how many (56:45 - 56:48)
times have they competed and just not (56:47 - 56:50)
been able to get the gold (56:48 - 56:53)
Etc that's also why they do uh the win (56:50 - 56:57)
and ends they could show an 8-0 match or (56:53 - 56:59)
a 7-0 match but it's not as exciting (56:57 - 57:01)
because those are guaranteed for day (56:59 - 57:03)
twos what they want to show is the six (57:01 - 57:06)
in the six and one or the the ones that (57:03 - 57:08)
if you lose you're not making it anymore (57:06 - 57:10)
so one of the two players aren't making (57:08 - 57:12)
it today too (57:10 - 57:14)
I think the cool thing about Pokemon too (57:12 - 57:16)
is even if the player has this sounds (57:14 - 57:18)
mean even if the player has no (57:16 - 57:21)
personality at all they could have like (57:18 - 57:23)
a really cool like team like oh this (57:21 - 57:27)
person's using like (57:23 - 57:27)
kalefke's like not unique yeah but yeah (57:29 - 57:33)
yeah like oathworm was like one for a (57:31 - 57:35)
while like people were like oh and oh (57:33 - 57:38)
yeah both worms on screen yeah (57:35 - 57:39)
that was an orthmore movie that's always (57:38 - 57:41)
the best though when you're when you go (57:39 - 57:43)
and you you see like very unique Pokemon (57:41 - 57:46)
used in in uh Internationals or (57:43 - 57:49)
regionals uh I know whenever we go over (57:46 - 57:51)
our when we whenever we do our like (57:49 - 57:53)
Regional recap or national recap and we (57:51 - 57:56)
see those like clef keys in there or (57:53 - 57:58)
like the the earthworms we're always (57:56 - 58:01)
like so excited yeah why is this good (57:58 - 58:04)
why is this good compared to the the big (58:01 - 58:07)
meta that we we see all the time (58:04 - 58:09)
um it's yeah it's really cool to see (58:07 - 58:11)
it's the under you want to root for the (58:09 - 58:13)
underdog oh yeah when I was uh I guess (58:11 - 58:16)
that's it again when I was at the DC (58:13 - 58:17)
worlds (58:16 - 58:19)
um I think it was DC worlds where or (58:17 - 58:21)
maybe it was Nashville where no it was (58:19 - 58:22)
Nashville where like somebody had an (58:21 - 58:24)
Umbreon at the time and Umbreon was just (58:22 - 58:27)
not seen competitively and anytime (58:24 - 58:29)
Umbreon came on screen like the crowd (58:27 - 58:32)
would just like erupt I was in the crowd (58:29 - 58:34)
when Pachirisu one world so I was there (58:32 - 58:35)
for that too oh you were there for that (58:34 - 58:37)
one yeah yeah I was there for that and (58:35 - 58:38)
people can see me the crowd holding up a (58:37 - 58:40)
sign and people will never forget that (58:38 - 58:42)
people like never forget that is like (58:40 - 58:44)
defining this game like that was the (58:42 - 58:45)
first moment where it was like whoa this (58:44 - 58:48)
Pokemon this little Peak clone just one (58:45 - 58:49)
tournament (58:48 - 58:51)
the last one too that's what's Wild (58:49 - 58:52)
because typically for worlds people (58:51 - 58:54)
bring what's safe people bring what's (58:52 - 58:57)
competitive they bring what they know is (58:54 - 58:59)
good so when a player makes a bold (58:57 - 59:03)
choice to bring and not like a Pachirisu (58:59 - 59:06)
for example it's just like oh (59:03 - 59:09)
that's crazy they traveled from uh Korea (59:06 - 59:12)
to bring Pachirisu cool you have to have (59:09 - 59:13)
some like big confidence in your (59:12 - 59:15)
pasharisu if you're gonna go all the way (59:13 - 59:17)
from Korea to go and win with that yeah (59:15 - 59:20)
uh how does it how does it feel to have (59:17 - 59:22)
been a part of that level of History (59:20 - 59:25)
kind of crazy kind of crazy that it was (59:22 - 59:29)
uh almost 10 years ago that's true or a (59:25 - 59:31)
year off yeah almost 10 years ago yeah (59:29 - 59:33)
2014. like it's kind of become the (59:31 - 59:36)
mascot of Worlds almost like you you (59:33 - 59:38)
will see you always see like when (59:36 - 59:40)
they're doing the the Highlight Reel (59:38 - 59:41)
there will always be a pastry through (59:40 - 59:44)
somewhere yes (59:41 - 59:45)
and always staging Park holding up that (59:44 - 59:48)
trophy like this like that's just a part (59:45 - 59:49)
of the Highlight Reel and it forever (59:48 - 59:52)
will be it also helps that like there (59:49 - 59:55)
was a documentary that they did about (59:52 - 59:57)
him once right where they like showed (59:55 - 59:59)
his room sure there were multiple yeah (59:57 - 60:00)
right they've done multiple yeah they (59:59 - 60:04)
showed his room and it's like full of (60:00 - 60:06)
battery Sue memorabilia he commits to (60:04 - 60:08)
the bit I like that he committed hard (60:06 - 60:12)
and I respect it I'm I'm curious I I (60:08 - 60:14)
maybe maybe he's talked about it of like (60:12 - 60:17)
if he loved pacharisu going in or (60:14 - 60:19)
because he he has talked about how like (60:17 - 60:20)
pacharisu was just like the right (60:19 - 60:23)
Pokemon at the right time in that format (60:20 - 60:25)
um and like that's why it won because it (60:23 - 60:27)
was just one of the it had like follow (60:25 - 60:29)
me it was bulky enough like its moveset (60:27 - 60:31)
so it was like the right Pokemon at the (60:29 - 60:34)
time but like now it feels like even if (60:31 - 60:36)
you look at his Twitter or you know (60:34 - 60:38)
anything currently like Pachirisu is (60:36 - 60:41)
such a big part of him yes that is his (60:38 - 60:43)
it might have not been his mascot before (60:41 - 60:45)
it is now yeah right right so I wonder (60:43 - 60:47)
if like yeah he actually liked it before (60:45 - 60:49)
here correct or if he's like dang now (60:47 - 60:51)
I'm stuck with this stupid squirrel but (60:49 - 60:53)
but for me like I loved incineroar (60:51 - 60:55)
because like I was like a wrestling fan (60:53 - 60:57)
I like how Lincoln was like this heel (60:55 - 60:59)
Pokemon I'm a big cap like I like I like (60:57 - 61:01)
I had three cats at one point like so (60:59 - 61:03)
instant or checked all the boxes for me (61:01 - 61:05)
so the the it just happened that (61:03 - 61:07)
incentives just the best competitive (61:05 - 61:09)
Pokemon out there it's pretty good I've (61:07 - 61:10)
heard yeah (61:09 - 61:14)
so like I I never like bad an eye of (61:10 - 61:15)
like I'm building a new team well like (61:14 - 61:17)
the first one on the team is incinerary (61:15 - 61:18)
it's like one of my favorite Pokemon it (61:17 - 61:22)
just and I'm sure for some people if (61:18 - 61:23)
if they didn't like incinerary but they (61:22 - 61:25)
really like competitive incident or (61:23 - 61:27)
could have slowly became a Pokemon they (61:25 - 61:28)
really adored and then there's the (61:27 - 61:29)
complete opposite where people are just (61:28 - 61:31)
like incident was the worst thing that's (61:29 - 61:33)
ever happened to this game yeah I mean (61:31 - 61:35)
some people let their their actual (61:33 - 61:36)
emotions for the Pokemon (61:35 - 61:39)
like intertwine with how they actually (61:36 - 61:41)
feel about the Pokemon design wise or (61:39 - 61:43)
like I guess for you in case like what (61:41 - 61:45)
it is like a wrestling cat yeah yeah (61:43 - 61:47)
some people are just like oh Instagram (61:45 - 61:49)
sucks I hate seeing that thing but they (61:47 - 61:50)
they that could just be their (61:49 - 61:52)
competitive opinion of it right yeah but (61:50 - 61:54)
no one can deny and sinner it doesn't (61:52 - 61:56)
look awesome (61:54 - 61:59)
that's such a cool Pokemon compared to (61:56 - 62:02)
skeleturge I'll take in cinema any day (61:59 - 62:04)
there are going to be people who fight (62:02 - 62:06)
you tooth and nail on that sentence (62:04 - 62:10)
alone because incinerar as it as it was (62:06 - 62:12)
in The Meta like totally flipped (62:10 - 62:15)
people's opinion of it right like they (62:12 - 62:17)
didn't the people stopped liking cats (62:15 - 62:18)
because (62:17 - 62:20)
Etc but you know what I like about (62:18 - 62:21)
incinero is a controversy that started (62:20 - 62:23)
because (62:21 - 62:25)
uh I think at the time (62:23 - 62:27)
we had so many firefighting starters (62:25 - 62:29)
yeah and the second that it was leaked (62:27 - 62:31)
that it's gonna be a wrestler cat the (62:29 - 62:32)
typings weren't announced yet so they're (62:31 - 62:35)
like oh my goodness another firefighting (62:32 - 62:37)
time turns out it's a heal so it's an (62:35 - 62:39)
evil Pokemon yeah it's a dark type it's (62:37 - 62:41)
a lot cooler now (62:39 - 62:43)
I don't know you got two wrestling fans (62:41 - 62:46)
and then you got Mike yeah no yeah you (62:43 - 62:49)
just said a heel a heel means bad guy in (62:46 - 62:52)
wrestler in wrestling terms so it was uh (62:49 - 62:54)
and Pokemon have categories like Pikachu (62:52 - 62:55)
is like the electric Mouse Pokemon (62:54 - 62:56)
Butterfree is the butterfly Pokemon (62:55 - 62:59)
incinerary is known as the heel Pokemon (62:56 - 63:01)
and if you didn't know this is Japan is (62:59 - 63:03)
really big on wrestling too oh yeah yeah (63:01 - 63:05)
yeah they're like probably (63:03 - 63:08)
number two country after the United (63:05 - 63:10)
States when it comes to wrestling yeah (63:08 - 63:11)
they went they went all in with (63:10 - 63:14)
incentives like lore and like how how (63:11 - 63:17)
he's designed and um like his moveset is (63:14 - 63:18)
is very (63:17 - 63:21)
um like cheat like heals bad guys in (63:18 - 63:23)
wrestling like they cheat a lot that's (63:21 - 63:24)
why they're bad guys (63:23 - 63:26)
um (63:24 - 63:26)
this is (63:29 - 63:32)
I was just watching forbidden door and (63:34 - 63:39)
then I was like tomahirishi came out I (63:37 - 63:39)
was like oh he kind of looks like (63:39 - 63:41)
incinora like I can see I can see the (63:39 - 63:44)
resemblance (63:41 - 63:47)
I was looking at primarina uh The (63:44 - 63:49)
Soloist Pokemon the soulless rione the (63:47 - 63:52)
pop star yeah brione is the pop star (63:49 - 63:56)
Pokemon uh what what's uh the other one (63:52 - 63:58)
Torah cat the fire cat okay that's (63:56 - 64:00)
nothing (63:58 - 64:00)
Pokemon I think the drumming Pokemon yes (64:03 - 64:08)
okay so what's decidueye then that's the (64:06 - 64:10)
actual Arch Arrow quill oh Aero quill (64:08 - 64:14)
yeah just fancy way for Archer yeah (64:10 - 64:16)
very cool and then dartrix is the blade (64:14 - 64:20)
quill I need to to study up on my uh (64:16 - 64:22)
like the X Pokemon that would be a fun (64:20 - 64:24)
game if we just say what that Pokemon is (64:22 - 64:25)
in their species type we have to guess (64:24 - 64:27)
what that Pokemon that's like that's (64:25 - 64:30)
like easy Jeopardy or easy for you hold (64:27 - 64:33)
on easy for you what is the heal Pokemon (64:30 - 64:36)
Alex (64:33 - 64:36)
he's gonna go okay well let's let's do (64:36 - 64:40)
one real quick what's avalug what do you (64:38 - 64:43)
think avalock is I think apple is the (64:40 - 64:45)
coffee table Pokemon I think Avalon is (64:43 - 64:47)
the iceberg Pokemon Steve is clearly (64:45 - 64:50)
correct (64:47 - 64:50)
uh now Steve you give me a Pokemon uh uh (64:52 - 64:58)
you want me to give you the the category (64:55 - 65:01)
or the no just give me a Pokemon one (64:58 - 65:04)
name miascarata that's going to be the (65:01 - 65:07)
magician I'm gonna have to say like the (65:04 - 65:09)
clown Pokemon the magician (65:07 - 65:12)
but what about Delphox no Delphox might (65:09 - 65:15)
be also a magician Pokemon I see I can't (65:12 - 65:17)
remember what meowskarada was that's why (65:15 - 65:19)
I brought it up because if I think I'm (65:17 - 65:20)
thinking masquerade the Masquerade (65:19 - 65:24)
Pokemon oh interesting uh miascarata is (65:20 - 65:26)
actually the magician Pokemon oh it is (65:24 - 65:27)
the magician Pokemon you gotta go with (65:26 - 65:29)
your gut sometimes guys you just gotta (65:27 - 65:30)
go with it so then what's the fox I bet (65:29 - 65:32)
is also the magician Pokemon it's gonna (65:30 - 65:33)
say the fox magician Pokemon yeah (65:32 - 65:34)
probably (65:33 - 65:38)
I can tell you okay the Del Fox is (65:34 - 65:39)
actually (65:38 - 65:41)
not the magician Pokemon but is just the (65:39 - 65:45)
fox Pokemon oh my goodness they really (65:41 - 65:46)
dropped the ball during excellent I (65:45 - 65:48)
could have done Mage at least they could (65:46 - 65:50)
have done so much more they also had (65:48 - 65:53)
like two pre-evolutions (65:50 - 65:56)
before it got to the fox I don't know (65:53 - 65:58)
I don't know either this also confirms (65:56 - 65:59)
the existence of foxes in the Pokemon (65:58 - 66:02)
world just like oh I mean Pikachu is a (65:59 - 66:03)
rat mouse (66:02 - 66:05)
right the electric Mouse electric Mouse (66:03 - 66:07)
Okay electric Mouse Pokemon yeah and (66:05 - 66:08)
then that one I think I could have told (66:07 - 66:11)
you I think uh Rattata is like the tiny (66:08 - 66:12)
Mouse Pokemon it's not even a rabbits (66:11 - 66:14)
they call it a mouse as well (66:12 - 66:17)
that is a good point like technically (66:14 - 66:19)
these things don't exist right (66:17 - 66:21)
right the animals don't exist in Pokemon (66:19 - 66:24)
right so technically how is this in a (66:21 - 66:25)
pokedex like what is a mouse in Pokemon (66:24 - 66:28)
there are some questions about the (66:25 - 66:30)
Pokemon like referencing or using (66:28 - 66:34)
animals I want to say like near they (66:30 - 66:35)
mentioned dogs (66:34 - 66:39)
though yeah they mentioned dogs (66:35 - 66:40)
this game had a lot of dogs in it for no (66:39 - 66:44)
reason what's the uh what's pop uh (66:40 - 66:46)
popplio popplio is the sea lion Pokemon (66:44 - 66:48)
so they they brought it back they bring (66:46 - 66:51)
it back sometimes yeah they reference it (66:48 - 66:52)
it's in there (66:51 - 66:54)
yeah Mike I gotta say I was a little (66:52 - 66:56)
disappointed when I saw your NAIC team (66:54 - 66:57)
there was no oricorio on it you have (66:56 - 66:59)
some explaining to do you promised the (66:57 - 67:01)
people you promised there would be an (66:59 - 67:03)
oracoreo on it then you send me a paste (67:01 - 67:04)
like this is my team and I was like I (67:03 - 67:06)
don't see an oracoreo anywhere I was (67:04 - 67:09)
going to use an oricario team was okay (67:06 - 67:11)
and then I thought about it and I was (67:09 - 67:13)
like you know what everybody's going to (67:11 - 67:15)
see it everybody's gonna know what's (67:13 - 67:17)
happening (67:15 - 67:20)
open Team sheets I think kind of kill (67:17 - 67:23)
that team that's fair so originally the (67:20 - 67:24)
the team that I was going to use was (67:23 - 67:28)
kind of a dancer uh Centric team uh oric (67:24 - 67:30)
oreo with dancer copies other dancing (67:28 - 67:34)
moves so or other like step moves so (67:30 - 67:38)
with uh what's his name (67:34 - 67:41)
yeah who uses Aqua step once it uses (67:38 - 67:45)
that then oricorio mimics that and uses (67:41 - 67:47)
again before it goes and uses its own (67:45 - 67:51)
move uh so there's there's some nice you (67:47 - 67:52)
know mechanics that you can do around (67:51 - 67:54)
that there's also quiver dance from (67:52 - 67:58)
bokarona there's uh (67:54 - 67:58)
yeah not legal until like three more (68:01 - 68:07)
days until like yeah soon until after (68:04 - 68:09)
the tournament soon (68:07 - 68:11)
but I figured you know what like (68:09 - 68:15)
the second anybody sees oricorio and (68:11 - 68:16)
Volcarona and then looks at that piece (68:15 - 68:18)
of paper they're like okay that's going (68:16 - 68:19)
for corporate Dance I'm just gonna go (68:18 - 68:20)
and attack that (68:19 - 68:23)
I don't want to play that level of Mind (68:20 - 68:24)
Games and I'm actually kind of happy (68:23 - 68:26)
that I'm not because I'm about to drive (68:24 - 68:28)
for seven hours and play four hours (68:26 - 68:31)
later so that's fair I think I'm okay I (68:28 - 68:34)
always respect people going with the (68:31 - 68:36)
better choice or the more comfortable (68:34 - 68:38)
Choice yeah here's my next question (68:36 - 68:40)
where did you think physical assault (68:38 - 68:43)
vested wo Chen was the better choice (68:40 - 68:46)
like where did that cross your mind (68:43 - 68:50)
that was a is that Bruno or was that (68:46 - 68:53)
mocha that was it was one of our mods or (68:50 - 68:56)
one of our friends being like hey uh try (68:53 - 68:58)
this one out instead physical wo Chen (68:56 - 69:01)
you'll have fun and I said all right I (68:59 - 69:04)
guess I'm having fun (69:01 - 69:06)
because they said that nobody calcs for (69:04 - 69:08)
physical well Chan of course not (69:06 - 69:12)
why would they have to so (69:08 - 69:12)
anyway Kevin you wanna you wanna talk (69:13 - 69:16)
about your team okay I'm running hard (69:15 - 69:19)
trick room so I'm running hat in DD (69:16 - 69:21)
um our murders (69:19 - 69:23)
I couldn't do it this time maybe (69:21 - 69:25)
honestly I've been playing some (69:23 - 69:26)
regulation d (69:25 - 69:28)
are there's a lot less dark types in (69:26 - 69:31)
regulation D I think armorous can do (69:28 - 69:33)
something in regulation D we're just (69:31 - 69:35)
gonna have to wait and see by writing uh (69:33 - 69:36)
hatterain and Dede (69:35 - 69:40)
torkel King Gambit oranguru and hariyama (69:36 - 69:42)
Harry almost kind of my pocket pick it's (69:40 - 69:43)
a little bit weird and there's a lot of (69:42 - 69:45)
reasons why I wanted Hiram over iron (69:43 - 69:46)
hands because a lot of people ask me why (69:45 - 69:48)
don't you just do iron hands hariyama (69:46 - 69:51)
does incredibly more damage than iron (69:48 - 69:53)
hands it's like not even one to one (69:51 - 69:55)
because you get the guts boost with the (69:53 - 69:57)
flame orb and your close combats hit (69:55 - 69:59)
like an absolute truck and the goal in (69:57 - 70:00)
trick room is to not have it last more (69:59 - 70:02)
than four turns if I can end the game in (70:00 - 70:04)
three turns that's perfect (70:02 - 70:06)
the cool thing about Wrangler that I (70:04 - 70:08)
like a lot it's a (70:06 - 70:10)
not only does it have instruct so I can (70:08 - 70:12)
do things like spam rock slide with (70:10 - 70:14)
hariyama get two rock slide sets off (70:12 - 70:17)
double chance to Flinch each time you (70:14 - 70:19)
can also punish protects because what a (70:17 - 70:20)
lot of people like to do when they're (70:19 - 70:23)
against hard trick room is to protect in (70:20 - 70:25)
front of it to stall it a turn (70:23 - 70:27)
with open Team sheet and with hariyama I (70:25 - 70:29)
have Encore on it and I made sure to put (70:27 - 70:31)
it on the first slide of Arcanine so you (70:29 - 70:33)
know you see it it's right there Encore (70:31 - 70:36)
I dare you to click protect against me (70:33 - 70:38)
because the second they do you Encore (70:36 - 70:41)
them and now they're locked there (70:38 - 70:41)
don't do it (70:43 - 70:47)
so hopefully something to be said about (70:45 - 70:49)
having a move that deters people from (70:47 - 70:51)
using certain things Ally switch is a (70:49 - 70:54)
great example of that in like uh (70:51 - 70:55)
Players Cup when there was open Team (70:54 - 70:56)
sheet and Players Club used to be able (70:55 - 70:58)
to just Spam Ally switch over and over (70:56 - 71:00)
it's like okay they could ally switch (70:58 - 71:02)
but will they (71:00 - 71:04)
you just never have to click it you'll (71:02 - 71:06)
confuse them eventually and then on my (71:04 - 71:08)
side I'm gonna be bringing a flutter (71:06 - 71:11)
main a glamora wo Chen a physical world (71:08 - 71:13)
Chen yes an Ironhead Arcanine and an (71:11 - 71:15)
iron bundle yes okay kind of physical (71:13 - 71:17)
world chin with us all this kind of a (71:15 - 71:18)
good stuff so the physical world gen I (71:17 - 71:20)
can appreciate that glamora is (71:18 - 71:21)
interesting too but yeah I mean physical (71:20 - 71:23)
watch and I feel like there's something (71:21 - 71:25)
to be said about it mainly because no (71:23 - 71:26)
one's going to be prepared for it like (71:25 - 71:28)
you can look at a physical or Chen see (71:26 - 71:30)
that it has a salt vest and still don't (71:28 - 71:32)
know if you can do enough damage to get (71:30 - 71:34)
rid of it and I mean it also because it (71:32 - 71:36)
it lowers attack right of everything (71:34 - 71:38)
else was it attacker special doesn't (71:36 - 71:39)
even know he's running this tomorrow on (71:38 - 71:40)
an International Conference I don't even (71:39 - 71:42)
know you know what I'm just running on (71:40 - 71:45)
no sleeping right (71:42 - 71:45)
um it's not going to go down to very (71:45 - 71:51)
much right yeah uh having the power whip (71:48 - 71:53)
having the pollen puff you can use it as (71:51 - 71:55)
as support you can do kind of whatever (71:53 - 71:57)
you want with it I feel like I'm (71:55 - 72:00)
probably going to bring it sometimes but (71:57 - 72:02)
mostly it's going to be that glamora (72:00 - 72:05)
that iron bundle uh Arcanine iron hands (72:02 - 72:08)
uh even the flutter main I feel like (72:05 - 72:10)
flutter Maine that this point of the (72:08 - 72:13)
game is just kind of a deterrent for (72:10 - 72:16)
other people to bring certain things uh (72:13 - 72:18)
when you have one Pokemon that is just (72:16 - 72:21)
so hard entrenched in The Meta uh most (72:18 - 72:23)
of the Pokemon that that come in against (72:21 - 72:26)
it are there so that you don't bring the (72:23 - 72:28)
the flutter man so then just don't bring (72:26 - 72:29)
the flutter man bring the things the (72:28 - 72:31)
kakeo the flutter man shocker guys who (72:29 - 72:33)
will see flutter Mains tomorrow if (72:31 - 72:35)
you're or not tomorrow you would have (72:33 - 72:36)
seen flooded Mains this last weekend (72:35 - 72:37)
correct if you are watching this (72:36 - 72:39)
International Championship you will see (72:37 - 72:42)
a flutter mate but this is the last time (72:39 - 72:44)
probably for a little while I hope so (72:42 - 72:46)
we'll see like 90 usage on a flutter man (72:44 - 72:48)
I don't know man who might see 80 next (72:46 - 72:51)
the way regulation it's like a lot of (72:48 - 72:53)
people thought that oh regulation D is (72:51 - 72:54)
going to kill floater Mane but now it (72:53 - 72:56)
just feels like oh it's flooded man and (72:54 - 72:59)
Earth Shifu now they're just both there (72:56 - 73:01)
I don't think it's gonna kill flutter (72:59 - 73:04)
made necessarily I think it's just (73:01 - 73:06)
gonna be less prevalent yeah just (73:04 - 73:08)
damping it a little bit (73:06 - 73:11)
infinitely bring fluttermans yeah with a (73:08 - 73:12)
lot of Pokemon coming in in regulation D (73:11 - 73:15)
it's like they're all very strong (73:12 - 73:17)
so the Pokemon that are very strong and (73:15 - 73:18)
have no checks like flutter main (73:17 - 73:20)
currently (73:18 - 73:21)
Vladimir will have a check like you have (73:20 - 73:24)
heat ran for example what is a flutter (73:21 - 73:26)
main ever gonna do to a heat ran nothing (73:24 - 73:28)
and heat ran now you can grasp Terror (73:26 - 73:32)
and just be resisted to a ground now so (73:28 - 73:33)
you have that option you can be resisted (73:32 - 73:35)
to a Mungus and just hit it back with (73:33 - 73:37)
fire type move anything about that yeah (73:35 - 73:38)
grass there is like so good on heat (73:37 - 73:40)
around yeah so Steve if you could bring (73:38 - 73:43)
anything to this since you're not (73:40 - 73:44)
