[Music] oh what's up everyone welcome to the 480th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj and with me is greg hello hello hello it is officially everything's pumpkin spices seasoning again at my grocery store we saw pumpkin spice marshmallows pumpkin spice cheerios pumpkin spice muffins i'm excited store i am excited also i once again proved that i am a pokemon master by finding mew in my oreos so i have sent that off to dabisco to get my second certification to match my certification from google thank you very much we'll also hear uh greg's grocery store is obviously behind the times because this is the year of apple crisp apple crisp is the flavor of fall for 2021. ooh i love me some apples there you go i should learn how to make apple crisp it can't be that hard can it uh you just take apples and get them crispy somehow we talk about the cereal no that's cookie crisp that's cookie curse there's apple jacks what is an apple jack clearly not apple crisp steve how many times have you played jacks in your life probably twice oh that's more than i was expecting you gotta pick one up and then pick two up and then pick yeah you bounce the ball bounce the ball and then you grab the jacks yeah only this time you bounce the apple and then grab the jacks how how come we have don't have a digital version of jacks i guarantee there is i'm sure there is it's probably next time like pour the iphone back and it looks like you're drinking a beer [Laughter] uh we have uh some pokemon news today the big news is the new tcg app very exciting we're gonna get to that a little bit later let's start with a little bit of let's start with the little littler littler stories just to knock them out the more miniature stories such as the 25th anniversary of pokemon uh first bit of news here is mamo swine will join pokemon unite on september 29th uh i feel like every update the real news is every update that unite has released has broken the game more well yes yeah and i'm excited to get my broken mamo swine and learn how to play broken mammoth swine and have them never correct it and just keep making charizard stronger yeah they uh you know you gotta make cinderella stronger and charizard stronger and that's it just that's called that's how you balance the game yeah exactly at least they like slightly made greninja not as strong because greninja was very dominant i mean it still is but that's before mammo swine came ah we don't know if it's an all-arounder or a defender or it's moves i mean it looks like it has isoco crash if you watch the little trailer um but everybody's saying that it's a defender which i'm like i don't know i think they're getting it because of the banner color but uh because it's big too yeah it's also because it's big but that that is sizeist and i'm not here for it i want it to be an all-around color where are they seeing this banner color in on twitter when it hold on because it just it's just the yellow the purple on top and bottom uh just like here's the hot take i'll send you the thing hold on there's a lot of hot takes in unite number one i got a lot of them number one is your role literally doesn't matter that's why no one that's why no one is using speedsters in the jungle speedster is supposed to be the jungle but your people are putting ralts it's chaos it's wild times out there greninja cinderace what was the one that happened to me yesterday slowpoke i had i had jungle poke yesterday i wasn't trying to great it wasn't bad i had a jungle mister mom one time and he dominated the entire game it was really it was really scary actually it is i i keep thinking the roles are going to matter more the only one that matters is if you're actually trying to play support as support because literally everybody just murders you i've stopped playing elder goss to try to climb the ladder because i was tired of literally being locked on by everything the minute i showed up you know what's funny is i i was going through the top players in the leaderboard and they almost all were playing elder goss it was kind of it was kind of yeah once you get into masters and you can't lose switch back have fun with the character you want but on the grind heck no i am literally i'll go to a go down and pop one bit out of my base and a swarm of things are like there it is murder the healer yeah um i like unite so much but it is it has so many little things that add up it's probably how people feel about pokemon go yep like and they're they're real they've been pretty good at communicating but also there's like this blind spot of it's not that big of a deal but everyone thought season one was gonna end yes and it didn't end and they rolled out another battle pass but the battle pass says season two but the rank is still season one season one and i don't understand and so as of this recording there is still no end date to season one but if you go back and read earlier press things it said that the first season it was it said like it said something like the first half of the season yeah so i guess this is the second half but also there's no countdown saying when season one is going to end which is a little confusing yeah well just count the days and then double them and then that's it yeah then but season one was 60 days and season two is only 44 or the season the battle pass is different this is just like the currencies gems and and minerals and whatever's are different so season battle passes and seasons are two different things so many tickets to get fashion items because i've gotten duplicates and the only thing i can spend tickets on are the things that i have that i got the tickets for duplicates they need to fill out they did add a lot to the store this second seas i'm talking about the tickets like when you get when you do the loot crate thing and you get a duplicate that says hey you get 15 fashion tickets and you can only spend them in that fashion ticket box i have everything in there you have the guard shop that's not a fashion ticket that's a hollow wear oh okay i see i say i say i see the things that i get to wear my clothes you're going to update more because i keep getting all these tickets and i can't spend them on anything did um did you guys look at the season 2 battle pass yes it's so first off the gengar skin is super cool yes very cute correct the lucario skin is not super cool i was like is this even a skin what is this you're wearing a nasa jacket or something yeah sure nasa jackets that makes me think of space they release that we're getting uh alolan nine tails hollower but yeah they don't show it anywhere they don't show it well they showed the pokemon unite twitter showed the um the trailer for it and it's very very cute i thought in all honesty because i hadn't downloaded the game but i saw the gengar suit and the other space suit i thought oh they're releasing a space map with this update agreed thought the same thing changed so the other thing is they changed like all the menus and they changed the loading for the better and they changed like not the map but um like icons on the map right and they added more announcer voices they did a lot yeah fix the interface i haven't done the announcements because i still have it turned off because oh so i thought there was going to be a space station thing which there wasn't the new menu is so much better the menus are spacey though they're like hollow gray yeah like yeah are they are they always no no no no they're definitely more spacey now i wonder if they change it after the season i have an issue with and that i can't so you know how you get a little red dot under events saying hey you have something to collect yeah i have a red dot and nothing to collect i have gone through that menu it's the stickers no did you check your actual profile yes did you get your fair play coins yes but the events box the one the box that says events has a red dot did you get your pikachu on mobile yes because that was that was broken for a bit so i have i don't know what is what i'm missing i have checked literally everything and there's still a red dot and i cannot find it it's the stickers it's not the stickers because i went through all the stickers and they turned them off and it turned the red dot off i going back to the the buffs and the nerfs i remember because i make these graphics where it just it has plus arrows or down arrows it's just really easy for people to like take a glance and i remember when um the first balance big big balance update sarah aura had plus arrows and everyone like not everyone but a lot of comments were like i can't believe they're buffing sarah orr and it's like no they're buffing well yes they are buffing zero but they're buffing the two moves no one has ever used on zera aura um because they've never buffed discharge and i've never seen a zero aura player not run discharge discharge is just so incredibly good i've never seen anybody they've never nerfed discharged but they've never buffed it they've always buffed zera aura's other moves um and so when i see like certain moves get buffed i'm like oh like venusaur like no one's running pedal dance so they buffed it yeah i get it no one's running dive on camera and so they buffed it again everyone's running why would you run dive surf is just significantly better and then i looked at cinderace this last week and it and they buffed blaze kick and i don't think most people run blaze kick um i think people run faint instead yeah fainter sort of dodge literally everything you try to do and then they buff pyroball which i thought was already pretty good and now it's like even more good i don't know it just cinderease feel already like if i was to go into this last update of like the top three strongest pokemon it would have been greninja cinder ace and blastoise yep and blastoise didn't get any changes except he was bugged where the rapid spin would slow you down you as like if you're facing blast toys and it wasn't supposed to slow you down and then rapid spin would let you like attack while in rapid spin which wasn't supposed to happen yeah i get it where are you supposed to hydro pump while you were you know if you're supposed to hydrate without doing rapid spin which is fine i do get that he's like there there's part of me and i don't know if like league or dota have ever admitted this i probably will never admit it like if a character is overpowered it's probably selling more and they probably don't want to nerf it because it would stop the sales of said character yeah they won't nerf it until the new character comes out so i expect changes after mama swine comes out because there's because giving a new character gives them a good excuse to rebalance everything because they've added a new element so it's an easy way to say oh here's a new character and now we're going to make all these changes to compensate for this new gameplay when it's really like we should have been fixing this all along but people aren't buying blastoises anymore they're going to buy mammoth sign which i am going to do uh did you guys buy the battle pass season yes i didn't buy the battle pass season one no hey you can get a kilt outfit it's very kilty there's only two socks in this battle pass yeah yeah absolutely no yeah first battle pass had like at least 20. my second hot take on unite before we move on okay is i see a lot of people in our discord or slack or the twitch stream that come through and they're like man i just can't wait to get to veteran or i can't get way to get to ultra i have made it to master and what i can tell you confidently by getting to master in solo queue is the ranking system in unite genuinely doesn't matter it is the the people you play with in ultra are not any better than people you play with in veteran the people you play with in veteran are not any better than master i promise you this and if anything that i have learned in the last 60 days of playing this game i would rather play with anyone who are who is not in master rank because master rank people have nothing to lose yeah once you get to master rank you you don't you don't have to worry about that crystal system anymore your number goes down and it doesn't matter you will stay master for the rest of the season like that number is so irrelevant because no one sees it but you and you will still be considered a master even if you lose 30 games in a row and master they just they don't the thing is they don't care those players and masters like the we we're losing before dreadnaught throw the game which i get like people do that very early in the thing but right but they'll just walk away from their controller like oh yeah is then why are they even playing i already have no clue but here's the thing i am excited to get to master so that i can try out other characters without feeling like i'm losing progress and like this is this is now my goal to get to master so that i can play other defenders i can play speedster and see if i like them without you could do standalone a bunch of stuff why not do sander for those uh because the other day that i did stander every standard match i did was a bot match literally i did five bop matches in a row and i i don't know why i don't know if there wasn't anybody playing in standard but i'm like i'm playing against bots and the bots are really stupid so i can't actually figure out what i am and am not doing in response to actual players because the robots charge it and back up and charging back up but like this isn't real play it was very frustrating so i'm like i'm out i just need to get master here's your tip from league uh you set up a second account called a smurf account that's the one you don't care about and then you use that one to fool around with and then when you get good then you transfer it to your main account i don't want a smurf account i also there there are so many like uh there there are a lot of people in our in our twitch streams or just a lot of people a lot of streamers on twitch that do have secondary accounts and there are also lots of people that have two pokemon go accounts and for me i was like i know my habits if i have two pokemon go accounts all of a sudden i'm buying raid passes on both or all of a sudden i'm buying or my my other accounts going to get the good stuff and then i'm going to have to like grind heavier on that to get the like stardust i i don't want to deal with that i'm a plus against it's against tus uh the terms of service you agree to not i take only one account per person come on oh niantic i'm like because i don't think that's in the tos for unite i don't think they care but now i after getting to mass rank i understand why all these people made secondary accounts it's not fun playing in master rank it was more fun to get to master rank than it is to sit in a master rank match and be like no no one here is better no one here uses their turn signals no one here is going to dreadna they stopped playing after five minutes because i had two master rank matches where peop where two people went to jungle and they fought over jungle which is which is it's so frustrating like like they have like what pride do you have at this point first off the zara aura said they were going to jungle mr greninja you didn't say where you're going and now you're going to be the one that's like refusing to leave i i i actually i feel like i can't play the game i feel like well okay come help me get to master rake and then we could not play the game together plus i need to get my lucario ears through wins that's true i need to get my car yours too play with me help me is that a fashion item yeah they're bad but i want them uh some brilliant diamond shiny pearl news actually what this is off nintendo soup this is it's just a tweet i couldn't find the tweet that they have the tweet here on the website so nintendo soup it's a website there's a website for every nintendo food item nintendo mushroom nintendo steak nintendo yeah nintendo sushi french uh silk french soup that's oh silk pie uh you know the lgbtqa nintendo iced coffee uh so it's it's it's a series of tweets it says the it's about the union room nintendo of america says the union room is where you will interact battle trade with trainers all over the world in diamond and pearl easily access the union room anywhere in the cinahl region by pressing the nintendo switch y button so that's it's the new wycombe that is the news in itself not restricted to pokemon centers right so if anyone's never played diamond on pearl you had to go to the pokemon center you had to go up to the top floor um so and then they they have more tweets here they say gather with friends family and other trainers using local communication in the local room trade battle and enjoy activities with other trainers you know or new trainers you come across while out and about and then they tweet with the nintendo switch online access the global room in brilliant diamond and shining pearl trainers all around the world can gather here in a single room for trades battles and activities so there's a local room there's a union room which we press the y button and then there's a global room which seems like the other room well i think it's you go to the union room and then you pick global or local global oh i see i thought they were saying there were three different rooms i see so here's the thing though how big and bad is that global room gonna be like why com is already bad and now it's got an interface of people walking around of so you're basically gonna get like 30 people who pop in and out as it refreshes i am not a fan of this idea of the global room right now because i hate the wycombe so much well it's going to be like wild area or like your lower screen in uh x and y and omega ruby and alpha sapphire where it's like you'd go online and then all of a sudden like all the faces would scroll away just scroll past in a constant egg hatching oh power please [Laughter] i do i do it is humorous that they try a different online system every game and they have it i know people are like oh the x and y one was so good it was like okay i don't think it was like okay yeah i don't think it was like the thing they should have stuck with never um and then people didn't like that for life that's why that was the greatest puzzle was pretty good i mean so festive plus is how i think the union room's gonna be right like people will just zap it and zap out like they did in the festive plaza when you walked around y-cob would be good if those filters worked yeah and they'd like if i could say like why com or why com anyone on my friends list and it only refreshed people on my friends list it would actually be incredible correct even even more basic than that let me say that i only want to see things from my friends and if i don't have any friends on right now just leave it alone i will get no notifications until my friend shows up all right okay cool they could have even added something like i'm only looking for fire raids because like what if you're trying to grind a gmax charizard or something right like it would it would kind of be probably a lot to be like i'm only looking for charizards but i don't know why com co it has like it's it's like two steps away from being good festival plaza may be like six steps away from me i think two steps is being very generous i think it's i think it's as far away from being good as the festival plaza was um oh you know they had that nintendo direct speaking of nintendo i i want to shut down this narrative because it's really frustrating uh so what narrative is happening on your uh twitch stream that's happening nowhere else he's angry that people are saying the new monster hunter is going to be about vampires that's why i'm into i'm into not the new monster hunter yeah you are this this is a no cause cause joe from cerebe tweeted about it too and people still don't seem to listen so they announced the nintendo direct right and they said man that nintendo direct made me so mad not because there was a lack of pokemon stuff but because specifically in their youtube description for the nintendo direct it said we are focusing on games coming out in winter of 2020 and then they proceeded not to talk about any game coming out in winter 2020 besides mario party act razor so so it is always possible and there's this narrative where like the narrative is this nintendo doesn't talk about pokemon in nintendo directs pokemon is too big for that and pokemon directs exist which is inherently false this is not true and so there there was a possibility that when nintendo on their youtube says we're talking about games coming out in the winter of 2020 you would think oh they might show something for diamond and pearl and they didn't and that's fine but that's not to say they won't ever do it like we just read a three-part tweet from the official nintendo twitter talking about new features of diamond and pearl why answer me that the pokemon the pokemon company has their own twitter they have actually like 18 twitters they got like 17 the japanese twitters they got one english twitter why did they tweet about it just because pokemon directs exist doesn't mean the nintendo directs won't talk about pokemon in last year 2020 the dlc for crown tundra and the other one isle of armor l armor featured in a nintendo direct that was only a year ago in 2019 they had a 40 minute nintendo direct where 25 minutes was luigi's mansion three and the other 15 minutes was sword and shield and so the like the the narrative of well there well pokemon is too big for nintendo directs nintendo directs have been around since 2011 pokemon directs have been around since 2013. these are not new things every single year a nintendo direct has covered pokemon except for this year nothing has really changed this year except one kovid from everything that's happened and you know game companies are playing catch up and number two there's only been two directs this year there hasn't been a lot usually there's four in a year if you can go to a wikipedia and look there's usually a lot of directs some some well there were four this year but two were indie directs which were focused on like your starter values or your delta runes and stuff but but i would wager to guess there hasn't been a lot of directs this year is because all these game developers are still struggling to catch up because of lycovid and everything like people are behind we know this is happening where like the game rollout's gonna be a little bit slower um because video game companies have been saying that so i this the silly narrative of life well pokemon is too big for nintendo directs you're wrong it's fine it's okay to be wrong now that you have this information that i have shared with you or you could just go to the wikipedia and look at how many times the nintendo direct has covered pokemon stuff in the last 10 plus years you now have that information enjoy it arcanine is a giant pokemon and a 59-inch plush is coming to the pokemon center it's 450 greg how many did you order uh right now i have ordered ten five for me and five to sell on the ebay market smart choice it makes makes sense here's the thing there is no way my dogs would not attack this wait why because it looks like a dog or just because it's the big stuffed thing that's very very very furry and it is so cute but every ounce of that says this is something i should chew on but yeah i would i'm not that big of an arcanine fan to pay 450 dollars to lead on a big arcanine as somebody with a giant mouth plush where is giant mouse which somebody bought for you yes giant meowth is sacked out on that chair in the living room don't you follow the stories yeah he's in the living room right now the problem with these is there's just nowhere to put them one your couch you have room to put it when you literally takes up the entire couch yeah and you get to cuddle with it my husband also takes up much of the couch and i don't say i don't have a place for him in my life [Laughter] he does move from room to room like giant miata when i don't know where to put him yeah exactly what is the difference between the plush and the person i married i think the plush signifies that you're poor not because not because of the price but because your house is not big enough to store it what does that have to do with poverty like if i had a mansion with like this bedroom that was like 2 000 square feet which which my house isn't even like a thousand square feet i would be like ah i can i can decorate my huge bedroom i'm gonna like like you remember you remember like nintendo commercials for like ring fit adventure yeah or like literally anything and you look into their like like 1500 square foot living room with like perfect sunlight and one couch in the center and they have more than enough space to like play ring fit and have an open set in a warehouse they built two walls we're like that's good enough for this right but no one has this living room except for rich people and if you and if you're only living in like an 800 square foot apartment you buy the arcanine well now your apartment's only 600 square foot because the arcanine's taking up 200 of it life choices life choices that's true look when you move here and build streamer house for all of us to live in we will have a room that is just for giant plushies okay and when you need one for stream you go to the plushie room you go in there and you walk amongst the animals grab what you need for your stream that day it's ideal that's how you actually know you made it all right i mean i agree with that psi yes yeah yeah it's 450 you can pre-order it now it ships in may hey guess whose birthday's in may do you really want a 200 square foot arcanine not because my dogs will eat it we're gonna take a break when we come back we're gonna talk about the pokemon trading card game live all right i gotta i gotta find a project for me to do during this conversation zelda majora's mask and f zero x oh that f-zero game is good nintendo 64 in genesis games i'm holding my breath for more pokemon games we've prepared nintendo 64 and genesis controllers to ensure the games can be played with the same style controls from their original releases wait they're releasing a new 64 controller both can be used wirelessly i kind of want to get the these controllers for purchase are you out of your mind you want me to pay um yearly membership and fifty dollars nintendo switch online plus expansion pack are you guys insane let's see a few more nintendo switch headlines i don't like pokemon snap that much and we are back from our break well they did it they put away we didn't know that like we thought it wouldn't happen we thought it couldn't happen not in our lifetime at least put away the knitting the yarn it is time to talk about the pokemon trading card game live greg time to throw away the magic cards you're all in here we go it's happening if there is a viable rosalia deck then i'm in and until that happens i'm out what about catter day canada was a good deck why did you play this is the turning point the 25th anniversary is saved i'm not even i'm this is not a joke this this this is it they did this made your life so much better everything you've wanted from life but we haven't touched it yet that's true it could be bad very bad it could be very bad i have the press release here let's go through the press release before we start getting into uh opinions where's the press release i want to see this thing uh i'll link it all and get all again i have a more bullet point email press release but here it's everything everything's on here too all right uh so it says today we have announced the pokemon tcg live a new app that trainers will enjoy the pokemon trading card game in an updated digital format playable on smartphones tablets pc coming to pokemon.com also for anyone listening if you're not into the tcg i i get it it's it's very complicated it's a lot the whole reason why i for several years on this program people would come into people would would ask me on twitter or they come into my twitch streams they'd be like what do you want most from the pokemon company you'd be like do you want diamond a pro remix do you want black and white no i don't want any of that i want a new tcg client i said this i've really boomed my chest for years about this this is what i want i want a new tcg client because the current tcgo was launched in i think 2009 or something like that it's like it's very old running on hamsters uh it was awful but the reason i loved it so much is because one you could actually play matches it especially in a post-pandemic world it was and especially before a post-pandemic world it was hard to find people in your city who played the game and who you wanted to tolerate and be around true and and who understood the rules so the pokemon trading card game can be very complicated and intimidating and the only good thing that tcgo really did was make sure you follow the rules and it taught you the rules really well even though everything in that game looked bad the wood texture was like from 1942 like the tutorial and teaching you how to play the game like it did it so well yeah um i learned from it it was it was that was like the the one redeeming feature here so some key features here oh actually let's let's finish the press release trainers of all skill levels will enjoy the new pokemon tcg live name could do some work those who are just getting started with the tcg will find it easy to learn while experienced players will discover the fresh challenge to improve and test their skills in addition to familiar activities like battling and deck building trainers can personalize their experience with customizable avatars and accessories the tcg live will be updated periodically with new content features following the initial launch to continuously offer new challenges and experience with the arrival of tcg live the pokemon tcg online will be retiring download access will be removed from the app store google play and pokemon.com shortly prior to the launch existing tcg online players will be easily able to transfer their accounts and game data to tcg live upon its release so far so good perfect the tcg cards from sword and shield as well as the cards from sun and moon lost thunder through sun and moon cosmic eclipse are transferable and playable live at launch that's technically accurate of what the meta is currently cards earlier from sun and moon series as well as x and y and black and white will be transferable at launch but not be playable until a future update players will only be able to transfer up to four unique uh copies of pokemon tcg cards one copy of an a specs one copy of a prism that's technically true you can only play one of those cards anyways 59 copies of a basic energy and additional copies will not be transferred uh so some key features here is there will be it'll be free to play without any in-app purchases this is this is very confusing uh we'll get to that uh there will be a both ranked and casual modes which is awesome so in ptcgo there was only the latter the latter was theoretically ranked but you would never see your ranking so um and there was no way to see a ranking and there was no way to know exactly when it reset people kind of speculated and narrowed it down but ideally um there was like an elo system let's just say you i'm gonna have to explain elo real quick so in chess or league of legends or any other competitive game there you you would normally start at like a 1200 ranking and if you if you uh lose you would like lose like 10 points so you would go to 1190 and if you won you would win 10 points you would go to like 12 12 10. and ideally the game would pair you against people who have similar elos so if you're really really good and you had an elo of 1400 which is 200 points above average the game would try to pair you against other people with an elo 1400 and in reverse if you were very bad at tcgo and you had an elo of like 1100 100 points under average it would try to pair you against the similar people right so it's a way to like balance and make games fair um the thing about ptcgo is that system existed but you could never see it and you never knew where you were at but it was it was very obvious if you were um so like when i i stepped away from ptcgo for like six years like when it when ptc joe launched i was redeeming cards and i was playing and i had a bunch of cards and then i stopped playing and then when sun and moon came out and the tcg got good again because spoiler the x and y tcg was very bad um i played like a drampa deck i can't remember what it was it was like drampa with double colorless there was another pokemon and i won 30 games in a row and the reason i won 30 games in a row wasn't because i was using the best deck or because whatever it's because i had a fresh elo and so they were pairing me against all people with that elo and i just knew how to play the game um it wasn't because i was like magically good or like oh the rest is like it's just my elo was like low and i was able to just go through it and then i got to people that weren't then my skill set and then it ended up being like 50 50. um so they're doing a ranked and they're doing casual that's awesome skilled based matchmaking they said those words okay they said there's going to be a battle pass which every game under the sun has a battle pass now it's a gotcha now so yeah and they said no more pac rng or trading the ptcg live boy that does the tcg live yeah it doesn't ptc doesn't really roll off the tongue will not have player to player trading extra copies of the cards are con converted to credits which can be exchanged to obtain copies of any uh owned or unknown unowned card okay this is probably the thing that either people are really into or really not into what are we happy about or really unhappy about yeah and i believe magic arena does the same exact thing there's no trading in magic arena if you get extra cards they get turned into credits or dust and you can exchange hearthstone also does that like hearthstone you can like dust a bunch of cards and then use that to buy other stuff um greg as a non-tcg players is this good would you is are you interested in trading are you interested in just buying what you're missing the answer is dying what you're missing in general i i always shall just buy what i'm missing because i find trading sometimes to be very frustrating experience um i'm changing on that but usually like my go-to is whatever i'm missing i just buy it and just be like okay that i know they have it they've listed the quality that it's in done well so the issue is trading in ptcgo was number one it was like i can't what is the word like awful it was bad but it was like if you were new and you didn't understand like have a really firm grasp of the understa understanding the value of things it was just confusing as all hack because like why is one pack of this particular uh set which ran randomly when you open it could be a bunch of garbage but why is that worth like four super hollow extra rare b-maxes right why why is that trade you know the the the whole um value exchange system represented in the ptc geo trades it was just awful and it was too easy for people to get scammed really this this is the thing i would compare ptgo to bear with me here packs of cigarettes in prison close i agree i agree greg for the audio for the audio listeners craig's mind is about to explode there has to be a better no no it's it's it's it's that's pretty close although like yeah and you have like individual cigarettes versus a pack of stickers but you have to imagine that either the pack of cigarettes could have like eight obviously there's going to be like 18 that are unsmokable and then 19th is good and like 20th is awesome and worth the value of like all the other cigarettes combined or you might get 20 cigarettes that just aren't even worth a full point yeah you don't know if those cigarettes were soggy or not exactly they could be stale too you don't know what you're getting they could have been stale cigarettes okay okay here's the okay when when i got back into tcgo around drampa time before drampa and pre after grandpa there was a website um that would list prices for booster packs so here's the thing i know the people that are like screaming about no trading i i i i ha i feel for you there there is a fun system to trading and they're they're like looking at the trade board it can be exciting and like trying to find good deals can be exciting like we've all window shopped on ebay and stuff like oh somebody miscategorized this but there's also the thing on ebay where you're like oh cool ps5 for only 300 bucks and then you didn't read it and it says like ps5 box only and then you get a cardboard box for 500 like both of those exist like it's really easy to get scammed it was also not that easy to find deals but when you found a deal you felt like you've you've accomplished everything in life uh but as a as like an average player or maybe somebody who just dabbles with uh the trading card game like for a month and then wait waits until new set comes out and comes back for a month it was like to go to a website that website doesn't exist anymore uh to go to a website and be like okay emerging powers is worth 0.5 and noble victors is worth three and boundaries cross is worth four and the card i'm looking for is full art lysander and full art lysander is worth 17 so i have like i have like 40 crimson invasions but crimson invasion is only worth .10001 because it's a garbage set but if i take 45 crimson invasions and then stick on one dark explorers and dark explorers is worth 15 i can maybe trade for lysander you have to you had to go to a website to figure this out because you're like i don't know how much full art cynthia is worth 64. okay do i want 64 sun and moon a lola's vacation or do i want uh evolving skies but even worse than this buy the cards i want because this even worse than all that madness is enough but it's like also you couldn't like i i need charizard right i need charizard to finish my deck there is no way that i could just easily go and say i need charizard what can i pay for a charizard right i can look at all the posted trades and once again there's no as steve was saying there's no internal to pt cgo value reference so i have to look at those and say all right what makes sense and then it's like can i buy packs in pt cgo that i can then trade for well what if nobody wants to trade charizard for packs what if they only want to trade it for other specific cards and i don't have those specific cards i can't get charizard it's it was just like right now i think that's the biggest thing too is if if you're just getting into pt like you let's let's say you took a year off you like you like skipped all of sun and moon the sword and shield you like the cards they they made an amazing roselia card greg you're like i want to build this resilient deck but you need uh tapu laylee and you're like i don't have a taboo layla i just started pl i didn't buy any sun and moon topule is rotated by the way just bear with me for this example uh but tapu leila was a very sought after very good card back in the day you were like i want i got my four azaleas i got my four rose raids i need two top uleles for this deck i don't know how much tapu layla is worth i don't have any more booster packs i don't have any good carts because i just stopped started playing so going to will's example how do i get this topu layla there's nothing in the game that requires like i i can't i can't trade i don't have anything to trade i don't have any booster packs to open how do i get this i can't play this deck and i just can't get tapulele and i could i guess you could like make a reddit account and be like hey does anyone have top like you ha it would be so hard to get two cards you're missing um and you might have a bunch of cards you don't care about or you don't know what they're worth or like when i got back in i had um my friend kid was watching my stream and i was like oh i have like 40 dark patches and i was like oh this person will give me 10 booster packs for a dark patch why would i not do that deal and he was like don't trade those dark patches they're worth way too much like 10 booster packs is not worth it you're getting scammed but to me as somebody who didn't play for several years i was like 10 booster packs for a dark patch like i got 40 dark patches in my basement right now i bought a lot of dark explorers i'm swimming in dark patches i got dark patches in the dark patches but but uh but like certain cards were just worth a lot because of legacy or expanded or whatever old format they called it um so i think this is better i i think the trading the i i understand why people like trading there was i i was i look i loved checking the trade boards but for but you can't say the game you can't say the game is going to be ruined because they're removing trading and then also not accept that trading was preventing more players and more players is better like the more like this this was the problem with unite i spent eight hours on unite and i've met i match with the same people constantly yeah and it's really discouraging to be like i can't beat this whoever this dude is on the other team that i keep running into i lost we can't beat this guy he's too good i don't know what he's doing but but like it's it you want as many players in the game for your game to be healthy and for more people to get in and for it to be accessible so if this is like the thing you have to give up i think it's worth it i think just being able to buy the charizard you're missing to finish your deck to play your deck that you're excited about is way more important than just being like well i want i miss trading 18 booster packs for one card like yeah i get it but if you have so this is one of my bigger things about all online things if you have the card in real life is there ever going to be a way to tell the system i have this physical card i think that was kind of implied with the what the way they were talking about live is i think it's going to be they're moving towards uh the the code cards in the packs will give you the cards that are in the packs that's kind of what i picked you didn't pick that up still i thought they said they were moving away from rng the pack will still give you cash how do i explain this the the the the you will still open booster packs in the game but you can't get any more than four duplicates so if you already got four oddishes you can't get a fifth oddish so that's like that's the rng they're getting rid of it's like um so would it it's like place it with something else i that that we're unsure of i'm trying to they're like uh gosh unite doesn't do this but there are some masters does this masters does this when you when when you're doing the like you can you can keep opening on the current box or you can skip to the next box yeah but once you pull something from the box you can't pull it again right so if you pulled like five good things well like why would you still pull on that box everything else is garbage just move to the next one right so i think it's more like that and see this is what always sort of turns me off of online things is if i have a thing that i paid for like i went to the store i bought a pack i got the cards that i wanted i have no way of telling the app i have these cards i have to then do another random pack in the in there and i may not get what i want it is a very it is what's turned me off of mtg arena online is the same thing it's like no i have this card i pulled it and i can't tell you that i have it and some of these cards are like 50 60 bucks and then i would have to pay more money in your app to be able like in arena you can craft it but i have to pay to be able to craft it even though i have it it's like still one of the biggest disconnects for me about what what turns me off of of trying to do it both like i would probably end up playing trading card game live but i would then never play paper right because i don't want to be paying for things twice sure i don't want this experience of i have a thing in my hand and i have a thing online and they're the same thing but i can't use them i would i would say with like ptcgo or even like games like apex or pokemon unite at a certain point you just you're no longer playing catch-up like if if you if you were if you were getting 100 200 booster packs at whether the real booster packs or you just were buying code cards online you usually had so much in your inventory for trading power and at that point if you're that kind of player you probably understood how the trading board worked that you probably wouldn't have to worry about like cards you're missing like you you would have just so many um and the same thing for like apex or unite like if you grinded out your currency you probably will never have to buy another character again like by the time a new character comes out you will just have enough currency to unlock it for free and never have to worry about like giving the game money the people who do have to like your example greg which i totally get are like the people who like step away from a game for a while and they come back and they're like oh i gotta play catch up and where do i start where do i go um what do i have to do to get this currency uh so i i hope with live that feels better but i again like if if i was playing hearthstone for six months and then i walked away and for two years and then i come back i'm sure all those cards are garbage i'm sure if i broke them all down into crafting materials i could barely buy anything that's currently good so like i don't know i don't even know where to start if i was to come back to hearthstone like i i think they even i think they have season passes in that game too i guess you buy that and like i don't do that i don't remember i haven't played arizona in a very long time i mean but things like hearthstone that really only have an online presence i can accept that better because like i walked away but if i walked away to play the paper version and then because of world events i went back it frustrates me that there's no way to say i have been supporting you in irl terms and paper terms still for the last five years and that is meaningless for your online version i i i don't know the solution to that but it is a continual frustration i have of mine of card games that have both an online and a physical presence well ptc shutdown uh the the pokemon trading card game online will sunset just prior to the launch of the trading card game live more information will be shared soon they said this is supposed to come out this year so my guess would be the same weekend as diamond and pearl there will also be a community day event there there will also be a new masters event that will be limited to 48 hours and there will also be i'm sure a raid event and sword and shield they'll do it all in the same weekend and then it's how janine wants it she likes to schedule her stuff all at the same time pokemon weekend transferring accounts existing pokemon tcg online players will be easily able to transfer their accounts and game data to tcg live upon release additional information including exact timing account migration will be shared soon um how do i transfer my account uh they will both use the pokemon trainer club account service for login uh when logging into ptc gli for the first time ever any tcg online collection data will be automatically transferred um is everything from my ptcg online account transferable what about my cards okay this is where it gets a little weird again tcg cards from sword and shield series as well as select sun and moon series expansions from sun and moon lost thunder through sun and moon cosmic eclipse are transferable and playable at launch so that matches up currently with the current format cards in the sun and moon expansion which is sun and moon through dragon's majesty as well as x and y and black and white are transferable but are not playable so you can play those cards anyways in standard those cards were playable in expanded but expanded they're not getting rid of it just won't be available at launch but they said expanded will be coming players will be able to transfer up to four copies of a card one copy of an a spec card one copy of a prison card one copy of each v union card and 59 copies of energy we don't know if the hollow energy transfers hope hopefully they do i'm assuming many coins card sleeves deck boxes are transferable with a maximum of one copy per item additional copies of coins card sleeves deck boxes will not be transferable uh the tcg online players will not be able to transfer the following content cards from heart gold soul silver series this is when tcgo online started with our gold soul silver that's actually when i got back into the game avatar items unopened products and bundles certain coins card sleeves deck boxes in-game currency your friends list cannot transfer your save deck list will not transfer although you can export them to a text file and then copy and paste that text file into the new app which is really useful to make decks while unopened products and bundles are not transferable players will receive a number of crystals in tcg live that is proportional to the number of unopened packs crystals can then be redeemed for booster packs promo cards or special bundles i believe it doesn't say here but i believe you can do 125 booster packs that so if you have 125 unopened booster packs that will transfer to crystals when the game comes out if you have more than 125 it will only take 125 so what people are doing i'm gonna i'm gonna spoil it for everyone i'm gonna ruin the market here is they're going to ebay and they're buying code cards for crimson invasion because it is no joke the worst set ever and you can get a hundred code cards of crimson invasion for about six bucks and that will transfer to and don't open them you just redeem them and then when the game comes out those booster packs will transfer to the new booster packs in the new game so you can take for six dollars you can get a hundred garbage booster packs and then ideally when the new game comes out you'll be able to trade those for current well you get all the curt you get the crystals and then you'll be able to use the crystals but what's gonna happen is that transfer crystals won't be as good as uh bright blue crystals which are the ones that you buy directly and therefore one chance for christmas if we have the currency here we have that so but is it gonna be like a one for one like no is it so you could have a is it possible that you have a hundred of the bad packs and they're like well those are only worth three crystals and the no packs are five crystals no no no the the pokemon trading card game online all packs are 200 coins yes whether whether they're good or not if evolving skies just came out 200 crimson invasion still able to buy 200. literally i i know it's a joke on the show not exaggerating crimson invasion is the worst set they have released in like the last decade but i mean i know that's how it is now but do we know if that's what it's going to be i cannot imagine that like newer booster packs would be worth more than older booster packs since they've never done that in 11 years i i mean i can imagine it because i've seen it if anything some older booster packs like dark explorers which is an incredible set that's the set that has dark patch those when they brought they would bring stable eye dark gray uh when they brought that back they would keep it at 200 coins but yeah you're right they could start changing it i don't see why they would since it seems like they're trying to make this as accessible as possible there are different currencies here uh there are three currencies there's coins which coins are technically in the current game coins can be earned by completing quests leveling up increasing your rank and more they can be exchanged for cool new apparel emotes for your avatars and deck customization like cards and sleeves or sorry card sleeves and deck boxes crystals can be completed crystals can be earned and completed uh by quest by unlocking tears on a battle pass they can be exchanged in the shop for booster packs uh and special bundles or they can be converted into coins crystals can also be exchanged for the premium pass which increases the rewards for completing battle pass tiers credits are when a player receives a card they already own four of except for a spec or prism which you can only have one of credits will take extra copies and convert them more credits earned on converting a card is rare so like i would assume like a rare card would give you more credits than a common card obviously uh credits can also be earned by completing daily quests in the battle pass tiers exchanging crystals for some items in the shop credits can be exchanged for any card in the deck editor um so credits directly buy a single using credit credits are ultimately dust in hearthstone because when you crush a card in hearthstone crystals are for booster packs and then coins are for like deck like customization stuff but you can't give the game you can't give this game money so i'm confused of the battle pass because usually battle passes are like 10 bucks for a season and well does it say that you can't buy the battle pass yeah it says free to play without any in-app purchase was the first bullet point here so i'm is the i guess the battle pass would just be free and then if you want to accelerate the battle pass you can give crystals to accelerate the battle pass but we also don't know like if you but so here's the thing if you buy a booster pack are they when you're redeeming the booster pack are you redeeming it for a crystal and then you're exchanging the crystal for booster pack are you redeeming the booster pack for booster pack because when ptc geo first came out you would redeem the a lot of you would so when i was redeeming like dark explorers or emerging powers in the online game it would let me use that to buy any booster pack i wanted so i wouldn't want to buy more emerging powers because that set was garbage i would want to buy more dark explorers and then at a certain point when you redeemed it it would be one-to-one you're redeeming evolving skies you're getting evolving skies you're redeeming noble victors you're getting noble victors but when they first started off it wasn't like that so i don't know if they're going back to you redeem a booster pack and you get a crystal or you redeem a booster pack and you get a booster pack i would assume you get the same booster pack but then where are the crystals coming from besides like leveling up your battle pass but if you're needing crystals to also level i don't know it seems everyone just have to find out over time uh i just don't get why they wouldn't want like why not just have it like five bucks for a battle pass what's the problem here like you already have unite you have masters you have pogo what is the problem with somebody paying five bucks for a battle pass what is that first bullet point again the first bullet point is free to play without any in-app purchase uh yeah i think there's wiggle room just to say there may be in-app purchases yeah but in-app purchases aren't necessary ever to without any in-app purchases required required but i think that's what they're saying available i think that will be available um because because everything else strongly suggests that there's going to be some sort of in-app yeah so i think their first thing is you never have like the same with unite you never have to buy anything to play the game right like you can play usually they just say like usually they just say like free to play or free to start and then they move on yeah and then you go like okay i mean the intern thought that they were gonna make the language better make it fancier and they just used the wrong words they put too many words in there they put too many words in it i i yeah i think there is going to i think there's going to be in-app purchases like i feel there's wiggle room in that statement can you buy the battle pass and unite without spending money you have to spend money right you have to spend money you have to use jobs yeah you can't earn you can't earn gems randomly you have to buy them yep huh the other the last thing here is the current market for ptco is completely in shambles because of this announcement because yeah uh nothing like people like you you can only have four of a card so if you're holding on to like 20 full art cynthia and cynthia's worth a lot or was worth a lot i don't know if she's worth anything anymore back in the day she was like worth 64 booster packs or whatever like you're better off trying to unload those cynthias for cards you're missing but also everyone else is trying to unload cards wait i thought you got one of them for all your extras you so if if you have four if you have 20 cynthia's they will only transfer four of the cynthia's and the other 16 cynthias are gone they're guarding you credit nope for oh why did i hear that the wrong way so what you could do so let's say let's say you have a lot of like really decent car let's say you have 20 cynthia's 20 full arts cynthia's what you could do just give them to a friend like if you can't trade them or if you're you can't like it is probably better for you to be like hey will i'm going to lose these so i might as well give them to you so you have them in your collection because they're they're literally useless to me or if you like for deck boxes or coins like there are some really rare and expensive coins and deck boxes especially if you went to like a worlds 2012 or worlds 2013 if you have like four of those deck boxes like trade them to somebody because they're going to be gone um like i think i think i have like three sets of coins where i have like two of each and they're they're pretty like i don't know valuable i don't know they're worth like 20 booster packs they were worth 20 booster packs for the booster pack bubble burst um but anyways this is super exciting they're like doing it yes something you've asked for for years it's fine i'm curious how the details will play out but i think it's a good thing i hope it meets 90 percent of what everybody wants from it i hope it's good uh well it can't be bad because they obviously listen to the show and they're like steve would have never played this game if it was horizontal on the iphone so we're gonna make sure that you can play it both horizontal and vertical on the iphone and i was like gonna happen no you can't play it both ways dang they already showed that off you can play the whole game vertical and it's great it's small i know this is just he's got the mini iphone as well which is like extra extra small you don't need to look at everything at once i know what my caterpie on the bench is doing i don't know what you're doing what if it's doing something sneaky back there night speared prepping a string shot from the bench that's going to wreck my game possibly all right resistance or weakness to things on the bench let's take one more break here we will be right back [Music] i feel like i should know what vide does what and we are back from our break october is halloween pokemon go i don't know there's some

aware of your surroundings global network netflix uh yeah i this is happening i'm surprised they didn't in the in the web page bring up that they're also continuing the hoopa research uh you know they're wait look we already read a lot yes it's a month for pokemon go as it should be they've neglected october for many years and now they're just getting it out there here's five years worth of content we finally figured out october should have a ghost pokemon [Laughter] and a dark monkey that's pretty much all the news uh that we got reasonable mm-hmm so i don't know i feel like for you know we made fun of the 25th but new tcg app pokemon unite pokemon snap no no no no no no you can't no they're not 25th anniversary branded yes they could have happened at any time yes also you can't they're dumping all this stuff in like october november you can't be like oh we did the 25th anniversary oh yeah december 31st we threw a 25th anniversary gala celebration too late too late they should have done a little bit more earlier this year i agree yeah it should have been spaced out instead of oops all anniversary events in the last two months of the year i i will say i'm a little worried that the tcg will be very close to diamond and pearl but like they probably could have fit the tc they probably could have fit the tcg in between snap and unite unites only 60 days old so right i mean they could it's sometime this year it could be december when we get that out uh maybe december's better but the problem with december is we get diamond pearl in november yeah and then we get legends and jitty ware yes the end of january yeah it just it feels very tight as somebody who likes all aspects of pokemon it feels tight if you don't care about the tcg then whatever easy to easy to move on uh question of the week what's the question of the week let's have the question of the week is that little nausea maybe this is from kevin what's an outfit or piece of clothing from the pokemon franchise you would wear there is so much in gallery that i would wear and have worn throughout my life haven't i already answered this no i mean you did the veteran gen 5 pokemon veteran yes black and white pokemon veteran we haven't had this question before no no but i answered it before when we were answering another question yes uh like a full outfit that's tougher there's a lot of ace trainers that are like but there's a ton of really great items in gallard that i would definitely wear uh i mean probably draden is my style very simple classic american of the weird sweatshirts what is the one that i'm thinking of is it the king i mean i like the t-shirts from galler that have like all the different pokemon on them doing stuff no it's the boat neck sweatshirt the mischief maker that has uh impedimps in the flowers yeah i would wear that in a minute can i say i would be like the pokey nerd and like the half charizard outfit you know what i'm talking about wait was it half charizard it was a half kangaskhan half there's a there's a charizard one and there's like a i think like a just a general dinosaur one there's no such thing as a general dinosaur in the pokemon world it reflects something it's like um it's like green i think i think it's super nerd super nerd pokemon well because super nerd is a trainer class but there is i know the one that you're talking about and i don't think it's the nerd class no it is not super nerd um it is pokemaniac is it pokemaniac yeah pokey pokeyman where's pokemaniac at i got the list here i got like rich boys oh i do see one in a green dinosaur that's like a larvitar it kind of okay so here's the question would you say you'd wear the half charizard are you talking about the big bulky pants or the hat and the smaller pants no no no so there's one that has like it it literally looks like the lower half of a charizard with including tail and then he's wearing a charizard t-shirt with a charizard face yeah yeah yeah i would wear that okay um but i do like in let's go pikachu let's go eevee it's just a whole slowpoke cosplay yeah that this little cosplay is very good that's that's looking good yeah so the omega

really like that outfit i really liked the uh over world model the model the asa trainer outfits from x and y i think those were excellent as well they're very fancy i don't like the one i as much as i love gen 3 i've never liked the cool trainer outfits from emerald and pearl they're too jumpsuity i see which ones they're talking about yeah they're a little weird they're not they're not my favorite i would definitely rock the x and y ones and i would definitely have the snow snowsuit ones from the ace trainers from black white black black white two are very yeah those are very good uh and you were veteran right veteran from gen black and white yeah yeah that isn't that is a very good outfit i would also uh remember the gym the outfits from pokemon battle revolution yeah unfortunately uh the i still really like the rose rate outfit from that i would wear that for a costume party what was your name um only one question on youtube this week hey youtube you're slacking you gotta you gotta leave your questions and hit the like button and the subscribe and everything uh this is from ollie why don't we have more cafe mix news because nobody likes the game they just rebooted it we're catching up yeah let let the reboot happen and sit for a while let people get used to it and complain about that it's horizontal and not vertical which is yep did that make sense weirdest complaint in the world and then they'll suddenly be like oh hey here's 50 new pokemon that we're releasing into the game remember when will and i were in the shuffle it's a good time oh man i played shuffle every single day until i hit the wall oh shuffle i thought i was thinking did you ever play cat shuffle no i played cafe mix cafe mix just reminds me that shuffle was the better game scratch scratch that puzzle itch better i love i love the shuffle anyways well pokemon of the week so last week's pokemon was a list of irrelevant uh references to the particular pokemon of the week um from clue number one it occupied spot zero zero one in the coastal kalos pokedex you knew that it's not an evolution because why would they start with something in evolution that's fine um i mentioned that it's part of the amorphous egg group which it shares with miss drivas which is a ghost type but it doesn't share with other cousins meaning that there are no flying types in the amorphous egg group uh fluctuating level rate i mean if you know about the different leveling rates for the different pokemon that might have helped you it has no footprint only hands meaning it has no feet there you go uh made of reference to npc appearance in pokemon stadium 2 stage a super smash brothers ball if you ever played that game then i made references to its pokedex entries and its fondness for children where it's either trying to befriend one or abduct one um and in pokemon snap since there are no children it's trying to abduct another pokemon and finally it is a hat wearing pokemon there you go pinnacle [Laughter] it's drifloon binocle does not wear a hat it could it could why don't it work would it actually wear two hats uh no it's only got one head but it's this oh it's the eyes that freak people out it's very pan's labyrinth that was a good movie i only will ever watch it once because i don't want to go through the emotional labor of watching it again it's an excellent move well you don't like horrors no which is why i still mystery over your husband but sure he loves horrors he does opposite the track [Laughter] tripling was the first gen 4 pokemon to be revealed in super smash brothers brawl in the japanese version of pearl's pokedex entry driftwood specifically takes children to the world of the dead trying to steal them away in the english version however in the release of super smash brothers brawl the description along with driftloon's trophy states that it is taking children to the underworld driftloon shares its category with iggly buff jigglypuff wigglytuff and quillfish they're all known as the balloon pokemon uh drifloon is the only drifloon and its evolved form are the only pokemon not introduced in gen 3 to be found in the fluctuating experience group they're also the only flying and ghost type pokemon in the fluctuating experience group um i feel like world of the dead and the underworld is just splitting hairs yeah splitting hairs uh shiny i really do like the driftwood shiny it is very good is that the golden one yes the golden one nice very cute also great shuffle icon i is that a hat i always thought it was hair nah balloons don't have hair pokemon have hair it's got a little cloud hat is that it's clouds yeah but i always thought it was hair not a hat do you think he could brush it it's got hands yeah you think you could style it yeah that's going to be the who's oh you know speaking about clothes pokemon unites ruined pokemon for me you put a venusaur in a suit and then you take venusaur out of the suit and you're like what okay here do you dress your cats in clothes no so yeah but i would imagine if i put my cat in a gangsta suit or whatever venus are swearing at you tonight and then he's wearing it for a while and i take my cat out of the suit and then i'd be like uh you don't have clothes on anymore and and it's very it's weird looking at venusaur with no clothes on anymore that's what i'm saying it is natural for venusaur to not be wearing clothes yes and you're shaming of their free and aerated body has no place in this pod the venusaurian body is not gross correct these are the venusaurian bodies beautiful yeah all frogs do all right on that note let me hurry up this week's pokemon murder basically while researching this week's pokemon i came across this interesting snippet from wikipedia in place of the pokemon's name i will use the name brian jaber or jesus bear de brian count of i and of brian circa 1000 to circa 1040. was an influential nobleman in the dukey of normandy in northern france he was one of the early guardians of duke william ii in his minority and a first cousin to william's father duke robert had lord brian not been murdered the senior house of declare would probably have been titled de bryan lord brian was the first to be known by the cognoman crispin because of his hairstyle which stood up like the branches of a pine tree it is also intriguing to me that brian is one of the only one of only two mammalian species to be featured as starters for this type which started with reptiles but also includes amphibians and birds but no fish yet even with the lack of fish brian's family line are the only ones that could technically technically be said to have finn-like appendages i had originally thought of selecting brian as the pokemon of the week over a week ago but the decision was cinched when i recently battled pokemon breeder elena in ballenly and she gave me an eviolite for defeating her doppler that's so much information i love brian i i i you know brian yes i could see it all right well we will be back next week you guys sound so sad about that unfortunately oh we will be back next week uh thank you guys for listening
