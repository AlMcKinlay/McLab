[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 260 seventh episode of the Pokemon podcast I'm your host s BJ it's super effective I forgot to say that with me today I have will so is this the week where that I'm always right or I forgot to check the notes to see who is going to be right and who's gonna be wrong this week I guess we're gonna have to wing it well you know the ongoing debate never ends will that's that's why I'm going to be is the final heists to beat this uh-oh let's say we'll save it for later I also have Travis I am ready to Magikarp jump for joy at all of the great things that are going to happen in this episode good good you know this is a really great year so far Gen Con tickets are now available event tickets I should say we finally got our first kind of decent Pokemon game that isn't that spin-off game I should say because a lot of the spin-off games bad Final Fantasy expansion comes out in 20 days destiny comes out later this year unreal so far so good is what I like to say if you are just joining us if this is your first episode of its super effective welcome we have an interview with Braxton Berks a little bit later on Braxton made a lot of Pokemon music not official music but orchestrated music has done a couple Kickstarter's has a Kickstarter going on right now we'll talk about it more during the interview but if you're sitting at a computer if you're not in a vehicle moving you know you can be a passenger you could be a pet if you're yeah if you're not driving if you're I really get into this on your computer hanging out looking at Kickstarter you can search for Johto legends and that will get you to Braxton's newest Kickstarter which ends in a couple days but some really great stuff the interview we have a little bit later on you can check the you can check the show notes for the time that starts at Braxton also gave us some early samples of the muse that will be on that album [Music] so we'll have a couple 22 30-second segments sprinkled throughout that interview for you to watch the ISE break throw Nick Burgess so uh can I help some some of the people who are driving now and not passengers in cars yeah help the help ring I've been left right now everybody be quiet for a minute all right ready hey Siri search Kickstarter for Johto legends all right doesn't hate Siri only work if you have your voice was it supposed to work like that oh no no hay series dumb haha Alexa we add Soylent to my wish list wait no no no Alexa search Kickstarter for Johto legends there I've already helped out a whole other group of people who are totally like it I'll help out I has a web browser I don't think they can like the integration okay cuz isn't Alexa just like a tube that talks to you yeah yeah it's like two to two who likes from Kansas tube but I never never asked it to search for something I'm usually like I like so what's the weather or Alexa what's the news or Alexa how Alexa how long will it take for me to get to work it could do that but it knows where you work well yeah you originally tell it you tell it where you work it knows where it is so then it will say like it takes thirty four minutes with current traffic I don't think that would work for me I think it would I don't see why now because uh the name of the place that I work is most commonly associated with a set of buildings it's about a mile away from where I actually work and when you're in the district that's a significant distance I hear the kids call it the D not the district they do not okay they're from the right are gonna call it anything they'll call it the DMV but they do not call it the D nobody no no you can tell if somebody you can tell us somebody's actually from DC is if they say DC or if they say the district if somebody says I'm from Washington DC then you know they're not okay all right good to know we got we allowed to talk about today we got some Pokemon news some regarding Pokemon go the new movie magic carp of course and that'll probably be what we spend a lot of time on is Magikarp jump then we have the interview with Braxton very Pokemon focused he also gives us some behind the scenes of Pokemon symphonic evolutions which was the official Pokemon music tour that happened and so he has some insight on that and then after that that's a very Pokemon heavy interview so really really great one Braxton's are really great dude then after that we have some emails which one email might spark the anime debate again I know that was a hot topic and slacked this past week and then we have our Pokemon of the week so that's our show for you guys today we can just dive right into Pokemon news first bit of news being Pokemon the movie I choose you to debate to debate to debut in Paris on July 6 Pokemon the movie I choose you will debut at the Japan Expo in Paris on July 6 the movie will not air in Japan until July 15th the movie's director Japanese name that I would butcher and Ash's Japanese voice actor Rika masu Tomo it's a little bit easier than that first name will be at the event the announcement also states that Pikachu will be present presumably referring to an entertainer in a Pikachu costume the airing will use Japanese audio but include French subtitles that news is off Bulbul pedia Pikachu will be present a I think this is the first movie that is not debuting in Japan I think you're right but I don't know for certain I'll be curious how good that movie is compared to past movies because this is the first movie that has I don't know source material it's based off of something that's already existed it is but it I mean it just generally the the trailers have looked like it's going to be better but it's probably just gonna be the same formula as usual right at least be everybody goes into a panic dark-eyed shows machine goes wild somebody turns into a licking ton lick lick eat Ungh looky look no they don't turn into a lick a tongue they turn into a lickilicky don't isn't it a shiny like a lucky - this isn't a yellow not is this ah I might be making that up maybe it's just cuz I really like shiny lickilicky it's like one of the only Japanese in the entire game we're getting carried away here what a Pokemon victi need to be available at pokemon centre stores in Japan for Japanese listeners here Victini will be distributed for Pokemon Sun and Moon at Pokemon centers and Pokemon stores throughout Japan from June 30th to September 3rd this distribution is to promote the reopening of Pokemon Center Tohoku the Pokemon Center Tohoku will close its current shop and wander a er location on June 16th and reopen at Sendai Park Oh on June 30th some Viki like me a Victini got some more news here getting all this little news all the way building up the big news Yokohama Yokohama overflows with 1500 Pokemon in 2017 s quote Pikachu outbreak is off crunchyroll.com the Pokemon company and the city yokohama a once again teaming up for pikachu outbreak and this time the annual event will feature some 1,500 costume Pikachu's on the March an increase of 50 percent from last year the event entitled Pikachu DocAve Jenai Pikachu die Tahari Hasini chu which is which in english which as we all know my japanese is on point here in english that's not just Pikachu the Pikachu outbreak Chu will take over will take over the min taro Mirani district in Yokohama City in Japan from August 9th through the 15th the 2017 Pikachu outbreak will include stage shows a carnival themed parade featuring some 100 costume Pikachu on the March and a water-themed soaking wet splash show take that in will which proved popular during the last outbreak in 2016 the Holman taro mera area including the sky and sea will be decorated with Pikachu so tourists will have a lot of photo opportunities during this time what an event yeah I'm very confused about what Pikachu's have to do with splashing other than the little Pikachu who sits by my pool and Magikarp jump but how many males do you think we're gonna get where people are gonna say it's supposed to be Pikachu not Pikachu's because the plural of Pikachu is Pikachu probably like two okay I was just wondering what the over-and-under was on that let me recheck the article I mean I Betty I bet the Arctic I bet the article adds an S that's not I'm not seeing any asses in the article I probably got carried away my Japanese tongue was taking over and mixing and matching there's only there's like there's only two photos in this article one photo is what looks to be a parade like the Macy's Day Parade just with nothing but Pikachu's mean Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade yes yes yes thank you and the second thing is Macy's Day this is Dave right it's my favorite holiday yeah it's where we all eat designer shirts the second photo is 20 or so Pikachu in a boat I don't know who's operating this boat I don't know if any of these peaches have license a water license but they fit a lot of them in a boat the boating license test was like the only test I ever failed in grade school I mean I failed other tests but that was like the only important test I ever failed I was really sad because everybody else got their boating license and I didn't I don't know if that's a true story or not oh it's true why wouldn't it be true I don't know mmm boating big in Michigan and there's a lot of water and not a lot else yeah you guys got the good side we got the we got the polluted side over here in Milwaukee yeah Lake Michigan on this end is pretty beautiful friend of the show Allegra Frank she never seems to disappoint here with Pokemon news articles if there's one thing we can count on from Allegra she pumps out pokemon news like no one else she has the deep cut here titled the Pokemon anime just aired its most ridiculous episode yet baseball brings out the best and worst in all of us there have been plenty of silly Pokemon episodes throughout the years but Pokemon Sun and Moon latest may be the best of them all the series 28th episode aired in Japan earlier today and Twitter is having a field day over how weird it is so just a spoiler if if you're you know if you want that deep animail or not so yeah you don't want you don't want the twist ending spoiled okay the basic plot of the episode according to fansite Pokemon master goes recap is that Ash's Pokemon School in the Aloha region is visited by a baseball master naturally this leads to some extremely intense Pokemon infused ball games Pokemon Sun and moons new animation style has been polarizing with longtime fans for the Pokemon anime franchise and the reasons for that are displayed throughout this episode episode 28 is no has no interest in playing it straight as a parody of one of Japan's biggest sports this installment installments modus operandi that's probably something I die I notice operon die there have you heard people say like oh that's my mo that's what I stands for I never knew that and I like a bird mo but I didn't know right good for that seems to be go big or go home the scene goes straight up Dragon Ball Z with how into the game ash and kiwami one of the olala trial and trials get that's one thing I will say about these Sun and Moon anime is they are not afraid to put a lot of facial animations and face summations as we call them in the bits got it yes there's a bunch of screenshots here from it and then the article here closes personally we are also big fans of Sun and moons jokey tone this beta this baseball episode is the is what makes everything so fun it doesn't take itself too seriously Pokemon is fun the anime isn't in the wrong for reminding us of that definitely knows how to get serious when it needs and the theme song the English theme song is growing at me I hated it at first the Japanese one is as I loved from the start and it continues to be really great and the ending song is so adorable I can't say one way or the other the black and white has pretty good theme song yeah also bad I can't a yell Pikachu not giving Patrat a high five really good I never even noticed that in the for those who want to go back and watch the pokemon black and white anime in the theme song which is pretty enjoyable you can find it the theme song on YouTube you don't just watch the whole yeah you don't have to you don't have to suffer through black and white there's like a whole bunch of basic black and white Pokemon like Pat rat and whatever else you see on the first couple routes and Pikachu's like running towards them and they're all like excited and then Pat rat goes for a high-five and peanut you know damn now you get you just leaner Exley's Patrat hang and dry oh my god it's so good track just waves hello oh he's going for a high god there's not a doubt in my mind that's like that's like in real life when you're going for a high five and the other person doesn't notice it so you're like trying to play it off as a wave don't cover for Pat rat he knows that it's a high five and he's like trying to play it off hey it's not always black and white oh we always know what's right your heart always knows what's right yes yeah yeah I know I always know what's right screw the heart Pikachu is busy alright you talk about the new main series Pokemon game that just came out Magikarp trump no not yet not yet we got we got to talk about last year's Pokemon game Pokemon go Allegra Frank blessing us with two articles this week Pokemon goes anti-cheating update hides rare finds from view Cyril has been updated since it's been originally published but I want to bring this up because this addresses the the cheating in Pokemon go several Pokemon players are reporting they can no longer find anything but the most common monsters in their game the reason the antic has flagged accounts that use unofficial trackers or other software resulting in a widespread shadow ban that's the term that several Pokemon NGO communities are using for the action Yantic appears to have taken to curb cheaters for the mobile game a player doesn't know that they've been flagged by the developer as they are still able to play the game and find Geodude Pidgey Ekans or other common pokemon let me stop you right now Allegra Atkins is not common I've seen like one but I'm Garrett's read I'm sure there's a there regional differences like apparently if you live in like like the west side of the us like Sandshrew is like the most common thing you will ever find and that's just not the case here up in the chilly Midwest yeah I'm sure like New Mexico Ekans or Arizona Ekans are everywhere that'd be my guess at least but more uncommon Pokemon finds no longer show up in the in-game tracker according to players who admit from using BOTS or third-party tools in the past nyet ik has outright banned Pokemon go players who relied on outside trackers while playing the game the difference this time around is that it appears to be evidence of new automated banning systems quote it is our opinion that we may be witnessing the beginning of a machine learning approach to bot detection wrote eight wrote a user from the Silk Road subreddit quote if the parameters for a shadow ban are consistently adjusted server size as they can now easily be then the antics machine learning engineers can train their their detection algorithms in ever approving ever more aggressive ways and bottlers will consistently sorry bottlers those people recycling and both and badr's will consistently be forced to reevaluate what factors may be triggering the detection bahding not bottling and independent trackers have been long have been a long polarizing subject with pokemon go players while bots use to poach rare pokemon level up quickly and campout gems are typically revealed there are some who find them essential to getting the enjoyment out of the game afternoon antic disabled the own games tracker last summer third-party mapping services cropped up and many players rely on them to find a more Pokemon the developer has cracked down on these tools however furthering angering further angering fans there's some more to the article but I just want to read the update here update knee antic didn't confirm that this method is currently in effect but the company has told polygon in a statement that it is consistently working on anti cheat measures quote knee antic is committed to maintaining the state of Pokemon go and our community of trainers a representative said quote people who violate the Pokemon go terms the service including by using third-party software or the other cheats may have their gameplay affected and may not be able to see all the Pokemon around them while we cannot discuss the systems implemented we can confirm there are consistently that we are consistently refining new ways to ensure the integrity of the games in order to keep it fun and fair for all players end quote so I don't know if you both are playing Pokemon go I've played so much go in the last two weeks because of adventure week and because your watch works now because a my watch works which is just incredible it's so great to mow the lawn and turn on the watch and get the steps and hatch the eggs ah it's fantastic I love it so much but I I've always been on the stance of liking games that have server-side restrictions obviously there will always be somebody who gets through and that has to be adjusted that has to be fixed I've talked about in the past where games like overwatch or Diablo 3 or World of Warcraft destiny Final Fantasy 14 these are all games that rely on servers that makes it very hard to cheat I've been told that people have cheated in overwatch and and Blizzard is really good on getting rid of those cheaters removing from the game banning them patching that fixing of course this applies for Pokemon go since that stuff is server base as well no one's orangey or software setting for Pokemon Pokemon go no one's encountering a Charizard not being able to catch it powering off their iPhone turning it back on to try to recap that Charizard again I think that's why I like Pokemon go so much is it feels like there is that that opportunity for something to get away from you like a Skarmory that I saw and through a Pokeball and then it ran away and I was legit upset because that's the only Skarmory I've ever seen the only scrubber you've ever seen in your entire life in my entire life but I've been I've been told Pikachu in-person will be at the Paris event yeah true so it my curate correctly the direction so it when they say third-party tracking software they're talking about like those websites that I access like I guess some sort of API and then show where all of the Pokemon in your vicinity are like they're not talking about like for example the Silk Roads Nest Almanac or whatever they call it are they no no they're not talking about nest charts because that's just a website you go to people report that you know squirrel or spawning here maybe in two weeks that nest changes - Geodude yeah they're not talking about that I would because if if that were the case and they were banning people just for like going to a lot of nests that would seem ludicrous to me but it I yeah I I mean it's like sure I get the argument that the game was it was it was easier to find specific Pokemon when the game had stronger tracking functionality and I get that third-party websites and things like that make it can sort of replace that old tracking system but to me it's like you're using a third-party thing that makes it way easier for you than other people I get it and botting like gosh of course that would warrant some sort of action as an iphone user and also somebody who doesn't jailbreak or modify software I can't really speak to this as as well as people on Silk Road or people that are actually botting or trying to buy it trying to pop but for my understanding which is very which is not a lot a lot of this is on the Android side side of routing and installing extensions or however the extension is probably the wrong word but installing something too you modify and help the software just like how Android has most people who put Pokemon go on YouTube are on Android phones because Android has that built in that the Android has those apps that can record your screen as you play and record everything in and whatnot so yeah I was I was going to say I don't think this is a problem for iPhone users at all because I don't think there's unless you you do route your iPhone which depite are people even able to route iPhones anymore is have a silly thing yeah yeah the the I think there's a jailbreak for ten point oh I don't think for the latest version of ten point O which is ten point three point two I think by edit that just came out I think if you're if you're before if you don't upgrade near before ten point three I think there is a jailbreak for it but yeah I mean Android it's much easier to do this kind of thing on Android than it is in the iPhone iOS environment so the majority of the people who are going to be taking advantage of these hacks are going to be Android users and here's the thing if cheating in some way helps you enjoy the game more and I think we've all been there I I think that I think as as a kid or a teen or or maybe somebody now that I owned a game genie you you better believe people put in cheat codes for you know a hundred lives or to skip levels big head mode we've all there is fun to that the problem with something like Pokemon go or even stuff like world Warcraft or overwatch is you have people paying real money consistently so if I'm paying and I'm not saying cheaters you're doing this this is just an example but if I'm paying six dollars to get three egg incubators which I might have done this past week because I'm so addicted to hatching eggs now I'm getting I'm getting those steps in and somebody else modifies their software to get unlimited egg incubators sure that might be fun for them but they're kind of like ruining it for the rest of us now you could say like well no their game doesn't really affect anyone else but as Pokemon go grows in the edge and they add training trading which is you know they said they're supposed to do this year and they and legendary Pokemon which are supposed to come this year it also affects how gyms operate too because if one person is using a bot and the other isn't that person with a bot is a distinct advantage on right maintaining that gym so I mean you don't even have to talk about features coming in the future to talk about ways in which this affects the player base as a whole yeah online games like this have an ecosystem it's hard for me not to not to have empathy for these people of like you cheated you didn't agree to the terms and services you originally agreed to and Sony antic has every right to remove you from that ecosystem but you you violated the terms of sir yes is what you did get the legal jargon in here overall though I'm still having a great time with Pokemon go I've haven't missed a one of the two streaks in the last two weeks or so hatching eggs I'm thinking about going to the mall later today and like power walk in the mall and hitting the five polka dots in the mall it while hatching eggs man one goes really good huh like I am more compelled to finish my pokedex in Pokemon go than I have been in any main series game wow yeah interesting good idea I've been working on my living decks lately and Wow yeah and I don't know I don't know why that is like I cannot explain that feeling but like when I'm at work I'm fall I'm far enough from a park where I can't hit any of the Pogo stops or see most of them but I'm on the I'm on the edge so I can see like three of the six polka stops in the park and so I consistently check that once an hour at work to be like is there something over there I don't have is there something over there I don't have and then when I go to lunch I take the long way to lunch because there's also two other parks and so like every day when I'm going to get lunch I was like okay we'll stop at this park I'm just going to park in the parking lot pull up Pokemon go ok nothing really here I'll just hit the stop and I'll keep going but I like okay here's a good example so across the street from me at work as a post office so I over this past week I mailed a bunch of the stickers and buttons for all the patreon backers who signed up for that so thank you so much to our patreon backers finally got those mailed out this week I said before June before June so I at least hit that deadline so I was mailing one or two more I had international so I can only mail international mail during the day I can't mail it at night so I walked over to the post office had my Pokemon watch I had my Pokemon go on my watch I headed up post offices also polka stop so that's my polka stop for the day hit the poke stop catch my Pokemon mail mail the last couple letters check Pokemon go and I was like oh man there's a dratini that is about a half mile away I can see it and I was like well I can walk a half mile like that's not a big deal and so I walked that to get the dirty knee which I've already had but I want to get dragon there so I need more dirty knee so I get there catch the dratini look at the polka stops and then I see it a Stantler which is another half mile away hahaha this is all opposite of my work and I go I don't have that I'll just walk it I'll just walk it so I'm walking to get the Stantler and I get there and then I check again and I was like uh hop it I don't have enough hop it to get skip loom yet I can walk that I can walk that so now like 30 minutes later I'm over a mile away from work have you ever heard Zeno's paradox of SBJ in the Stantler it's a really good joke and maybe like four of our listeners are enjoying it yeah yeah I would hope I don't know what it is about Pokemon go that like I want it's so much harder to complete a pokedex in Pokemon go than it is in the main series game but I'm just so compelled to do it and maybe it's just maybe it's just like adventure week and seeing all these new Pokemon like I got a golem I got it I got a Kabutops I got an omastar I got a mega cargo I can whatever that dumb fire slugs name is mad cargo its magcargo I got Meg cargo shorts like I got so many Pokemon I didn't have before and I I don't know why that feels different than a main series game I don't know I will dive into that deeper next week on it's supernatural equations got started some some thoughts on Sun and Moon some thoughts on Pokemon go very poke my it's about 45 minutes great in between there's going to be a for his new Kickstarter so we're going to go there then when we come back we're going to talk about Magikarp jump because that's that's that's the hot stuff we're gonna do some emails and we're going to Pokemon the week so we will be right back [Music] and we are back from our break I am hint I am here with our interviewee I am here with Braxton right Steve how's it going good Braxton Burke's right yes really good at butchering names I been called Brandon I've been called Baxter I've been called Dexter follow the fall under all those categories so we've had a lot of people on the show you know wrestlers comedians voice actors but you I would say are primarily a musician is that is that fair to say oh yeah I I mean i slaved away in music school for four years so I think I get to say that I'm a musician now maybe I didn't actually get my diploma yet my school us to send it so but that's art school for yeah yeah so I uh I know your work I think hopefully some of our listeners know your work you have a Kickstarter running right now I want to get to that but I want to I want to get a little a little more information about you before we talk about this cool project you're doing but yeah let's just talk about your history with Pokemon to begin with it seems you know I've been following you on Twitter for I don't know four or five years at this point and to me you it's me you've always seemed like a hardcore Pokemon fan most of the Secchia most the stuff you do is music related but where where did that love of Pokemon stem from I so yeah I've first of all thank you for for being such a fan for a long time I've been doing Pokemon arrangements for yeah probably about four or five years and my love for pokémon and doing arrangements from the series kind of stem from my love of well the first time I ever picked up a bokken Pokemon game which was I think in 2001 or 2002 um I was I had just like moved to a new town and I knew literally no one and my mom was like go make friends you're bugging me get out the house so I I went to the bus stop and she encouraged me to talk to some of the kids there that were my age and I met one kid who was super into Pokemon and was trying to show me a gold gold version and I I told him like I don't oh I don't have a game I can't trade with you or anything and so then after school he invited me over to his house and literally just gave me a gameboy color and a copy of bullets yeah this kid was I mean he had like three gameboy colors he had all three versions you know gold silver and crystal so but yeah I was just totally dumbfounded by his his generosity and then after that I was I was pretty much hooked I would play pokemon every single day after school during school I mean I would say that's that's kind of like a common theme with Pokemon players they just want other people to experience what they're experiencing yeah and then there's the whole fostering friendships aspects of Pokemon both in game and out of game like you have to literally talk to other people in the old the older generations yak came back in my day you had to go out and you had to find a friend with a trading cable in yeah all that yeah but I still play Pokemon to this day so yeah it's not like I'm like oh these youngsters with their newfangled Wi-Fi yeah yeah speaking of Pokemon today have you played Sun our Sun and Moon yeah I have moon and I granted I haven't touched it in a while because I've been so busy working on this album but I really really enjoyed playing through the Lola region it's just so fun I the story the characters are so likable I love how for example yeah and his and his love for malasadas he is a man after my own heart for I mean I always asked people this like what was your favorite thing that Sun and Moon did what was your least favorite thing that Sun and Moon did that is a tough question um I'd say my favorite thing that Sun and Moon did was environmental storytelling which was something I you you only saw a little bit in previous gens maybe like black and white but like for example in the beginning near the beginning of the game and Sun and Moon you go into this person's house on a route it's one of the first ones and there's it's like home to this father who is really dejected and sad about his son who has left home and it seems like they have a fractured relationship and you can find remnants of his sons his son like living in the house and he's kind of like in shrines there but it seems like they they haven't spoken to each other in a long time and that to me was just like super real it like whoa Pokemon has complex characters in this world even if they're not you know at the for a they're not Anna the main cast or anything so I just like those little bits of immersiveness professor Kukui slab I just love that he has like a gym in the basement his lab so cool um so yeah definitely environment design um something I didn't like about sunny moon I had sort of wished the story was a little stronger I I loved all of the characters um but I think just by the end of it I was looking for something more uh I can't really like put it into words but yeah it wasn't bad no and I think we said that in the past that we liked the story it wasn't bad it wasn't good I think kind of what I don't want to I don't want to speak for other people on the show but there was like this it almost felt like it was Lily's story and not your story yeah and they they kind of I don't I personally don't feel like it was uh as bad as black and white where I felt like that story was so focused on n even until the very end of that game mm-hmm whereas at least Lily's Ark wraps up and then they kind of like let you be your own pokemon trainer again and get gear you up for the Elite Four and the the mountain climb and everything yeah life goes on right [Music] I [Music] switching gears a little bit Pokemon go was a phenomenon was that something that stuck with you uh I'm sure it was popular in your city but was was that something happening that sunk its teeth into you yeah initially okay now it's you know the craze has died down a little bit I mean I still see people out there trying to get groups together and building communities around Pokemon go which is super cool and I was more of that in Seattle initially when it came out it was so big like the first day I went to the park and I was already like talking to strangers trying to find rare Pokemon and asking them questions and we would walk side-by-side just like me and someone I'd literally met two minutes ago and we would like be catching pokémon together and was was pretty magical and the fact that it got me out of my room where basically my my studio is my room so it's a it's a bit of a claustrophobic cave sometimes so I had I have to get outside and Pokemon go was a great excuse to leave my room it was also it also really contributed to a like my music got way more popular after Pokemon go to I I was seeing the number of streams some of my tracks were getting on Spotify and a lot of people were adding my music to Pokemon go playlist so they could you know mute the music in game and just play my stuff on their phone while they were walking around which was super cool and kind of flattering yeah yeah yeah I would I would also say that my podcast got really popular after Pokemon go to oh yeah people wanted they just wanted that that that news that information which is I don't I don't know is is that like the age we live in where you see it with like Walking Dead or Game of Thrones it's like as soon as an it is over people want to jump on forums or people want to listen to podcast like people want just more of that and I feel like that didn't exist when gold and silver came out no it was well as definitely more isolated especially if you like grew up without much internet or you had like a bad connection it was hard to connect with people and you'd have to you know actually talk to people at school or something figure out tips and secrets I like though that games are trending more towards putting secret things in that players have to discover later and not including everything in you know a comprehensive guide so that those kinds of discussions can occur same with TV shows and stuff you never know what's coming or even if you do it's really fun to hear other people's input watching reaction videos to those specific scenes I know when I'm gonna go on a tangent slightly okay tangent away when force awakens came out because I'm a huge Star Wars nerd um I literally just like would spend a whole day watching reaction videos of people watching the first teaser trailers and just that people like bursting into tears and then I would start I would like burst into tears so yeah I really like that connection building that goes on online / geeky things like Pokemon go or our Wars or what-have-you yeah what about your favorite franchises so you brought up your music earlier let's let's actually talk about that because that's that's kind of what you're known for yeah so I started learning to write music probably around 2010 I I had no like traditional classical musical training I took a few piano lessons when I was in high school but that was about it so I'm pretty much I pretty much self-taught in piano and then later I started doing remixes and arrangements of Pokemon music for fun and by doing that and playing other video game music on the piano I started to learn how to write my own music and eventually that led to me applying to music school and doing more ambitious projects like my first Pokemon album Kanto Symphony which came out the same year that I started music school you went from you know teaching your stuff music to putting out an album yeah I guess there was a lot that happened in-between so when I was in college at public university um my first two years of undergrad I was messing around with music well while I was I was getting ready to major in international studies but I was doing a lot of music stuff on the side and started doing Pokemon remixes with Orchestra vsts and eventually I started getting good enough that I felt like oh maybe I should invest in some higher quality vsts so I I picked up some sample libraries using some financial aid money or at least money that I'd saved after having my housing covered for a quarter sure so being a responsible adult and all that and then I started doing like hey you gotta you got to spend money to make money yeah exactly at the time though I wasn't even making money so it was it was definitely a sunken cost but I mean eventually it it paid off yeah so I was I was just doing a lot of orchestral arrangements and learning how to write convincing sounding um orchestral music while I was in undergrad and then I kind of realized oh man I don't know if this is like International Studies is really what I want to do so I ended up dropping out and applying to several music schools while owning my music skills and that eventually led me to tackling music from the first Pokemon games red and blue and arranging them for full orchestra which was my first choice I would have probably been to arrange gold and silver oh yeah because those were the games I started with but I saw so many people responding positively to some other red and blue arrangements that I was doing and uploading to youtube and stuff and I I started getting excited about working on gen1 music and wanted to do something that was like you know a full-scale orchestral arrangement of the original soundtrack the whole soundtrack to red and blue I thought I can do it because it was um it was a lot shorter than golden sulfur so there was less less music to orchestrate but I thought it would also be a fun way to go back to my roots so to speak as a Pokemon fan and rediscover what made you know the original franchise so magical with the very first game so I I revisited the world of red and blue through my arrangements and that I finished a about a year later after dropping out of undergrad and then um it was released and a bunch of people really liked it I guess yes thank you let me let me back up a little bit uh for our listeners and for you Braxton I have I am the most music I I can't do anything with music I can't play an instrument I can't dance I can't follow a beat so that's totally fine this understanding of I don't know how people make this stuff like I get the concept but oh sure it's like people who like the understand drawing but they they can't draw anything past a sick person so you you said you played a little piano and then you went from making a whole album you so you're telling me you didn't really play any other instruments or anything like that you just sat down and wrote music which is like this like a Spanish to me yeah have no clue how to understand this written language yeah I guess I could break it down a little bit like what my how I actually taught myself because I know there are a lot of people out there who maybe feel the same way like they're maybe not as musical or not sure if they have the proper skills to like go into music but like when I started out I guess my background actually started when I did choir in high school I couldn't actually sight read music at all so I would just literally I think I'm saying literally a lot when I was in choir I actually would just listen to my section leader sing the part and then I would parrot him and just blend in so I got really good at picking out parts by ear so I guess that really helped me when I started to learn piano because I could sort of hear where the music was going even if I couldn't even if it took me forever to read music and I also bought a children's piano book like piano learning book uh to teach myself because that's it was honestly the best way to learn because it teaches you the proper thing finger technique which fingers to play with first for what notes how to play scales and I would play dinky stuff like twinkle twinkle little star and that's how I learned how to become more agile on the piano and then I think the first actual video game track that I learned to play that I was really excited about was to Zanarkand from Final Fantasy 10 by Nobuo Uematsu which is a beautiful beautiful piano piece and simple enough that I could play it it took me two months to like learn how to play it with both hands and I had to like learn how to play one part on one hand one part on the other and then try putting them together and it's it's really hard work just learning in the beginning how to play piano pieces because you do have to play with both hands so once you once you become agile enough and once you learn to like split your brain into two to play the bass line and melody and all that stuff you just practice and practice over and over my parents got real sick of my playing after a while yeah honestly it just it's hours of repetition slowing down your pace so playing a piece a lot slower than it actually is when you perform it at full speed because that that helps you to ingrain muscle memory and your fingertips you know you'll you'll just memorize through muscles where your fingers need to land when you're playing so eventually you're not even thinking about oh I need to play this note here and then I need to play this next on this beat yeah learning piano is if you if you invest the time it's it's not too bad but that's is you just gotta put in the time as far as working with like remixes and playing with instruments on the computer I I started with GarageBand honestly and a lot of people I know still use GarageBand and video edited in GarageBand for probably the first 150 some episodes hahaha I mean GarageBand is pretty solid it's a it's a really good digital audio workstation most people you know don't need all the bells and whistles of a lot of other sequencers so and I use GarageBand forever too until I started getting more sophisticated with my arrangements and but like professional orchestral sample libraries which cost a pretty penny but as a college student I had disposable income from my job and I didn't have any debt yet yet yes you were there yeah exactly so yeah IIIi invested in better instruments as I got better at writing and um was listening to a lot of orchestral music I'm such a huge like soundtrack freak I love movie scores and video game music so I'm constantly listening to um some kind of orchestral thing when I'm not working and all of that helped me and develop my ear for what sounds natural for an orchestra and eventually when I went to school that was all kind of like solidified and I built like an infrastructure for learning orchestration through like a you know formal training tying music theory to orchestration and so it all started being more cohesive and my music got a lot better after I was in school [Music] tell me about your first Kickstarter here it's Pokemon reorg straited presents double team you had 937 backers $21,000 this was early 2013 yeah that sounds about right yeah it was um just hearing those numbers again is like so cool I I'm just astounded at how many Pokemon fans really love the orchestral arrangements that me and my friend Eric who was co-producer on the album did yeah double team was sort of born out of a desire to work with live players like before going to music school I'd work exclusively with virtual instruments and synthesized orchestral instruments so I'd never actually talked to a live player and asked them hey is this actually playable okay I was just kind of going off of what sounded right to my ear so Phaedra can do it better than you yeah i exact well yeah in some cases and a lot a lot of my music that I write is even it's still pretty difficult for live players uh I've gotten good enough where I can like write a part that is literally it's playable but you know might be best played by a professional orchestra like the London Symphony but um like yeah top tier yeah a lot of my early music suffered from clunkiness and awkward instrumentation non idiomatic writing that just sounded super fake so going to school I formed the small ensemble to perform a Nintendo medley and I invited Eric to come rehearse with us cuz that was my first time in front of live human beings trying to like conduct an ensemble and so he was there he he'd worked with he's worked with live musicians before he's a percussionist so he's played in various bands and ensembles and we rehearsed together and then when we went home later that night we were talking about how cool it would be to actually book a professional orchestra to play stuff like Pokemon music which was what I was doing and at the time and and he Erica's is pretty much a go-getter and said well why not let's just do a Kickstarter we've done Kickstarter's in the past and I was like oh okay so yeah then we launched a Kickstarter to work with a bunch of Seattle Symphony players in studio X in downtown Seattle and yeah I was all crowd funded and got all of the music prepped and performed and recorded with live steering players live piano it was the most harrowing experience in my entire life just learning it was definitely a trial by fire I learned very quickly how to notate music how to write for a live ensemble what things worked what things didn't after hearing them perform stuff and so it at the same time as scary as it was it was an invaluable lesson in writing music so it was um I was very grateful to our backers and I'm so grateful to everyone who made that album a reality because it it really improved my own music and we got to write cool Pokemon arrangements well you wrote you wrote more after that you launched hoenn summer yeah I miss Hoenn yeah I feel like no one no one mentions Hoenn summer as much as say TT more canto symphony cuz or aza just come out when I really tell in summer and so I was I was on all aboard the hype train but uh yeah I I tried to throw in as many trumpets in there as I could you know if the hoenn fans what they want I don't know how to phrase this question so you did all that you did double-team you did albums before you did Hoenn summer and then big Papa Pokemon company came along and they were like let's do Pokemon symphonic evolutions and let's tour the world yeah which you know they have every right to write it's their franchise but yeah there they were definitely kind of stepping on a niche that you and Eric I don't say I don't know how much involvement Eric has besides oh well on double team yeah he was he was co-producer every every other Pokemon ray or castrated release was me but I've also I also include a lot of the musicians we've worked with under the Pokemon reor castrated umbrella so oh I understand the confusion there okay that makes sense so you know they're kind of stepping on that this niche that you had and I'm sure other artists have done Pokemon music remixes you know all other stuff so how like was that exciting for you was that frustrating for you was that did they did they even talk to you not that they need to talk to you but were they like hey we like your music no yeah actually I'm I'm good friends with Jaron more the producer of Pokemon symphonic evolutions he also produced Legend of Zelda symphony of the goddesses and I attended both shows multiple times in my city and even other cities when I was traveling and I absolutely love the work that Jaron and Chad do Chad the arranger for both Zelda Symphony and Pokemon Symphony it was actually I was actually really flattered to be approached by Jaron before they had proposed the idea of the symphony to the Pokemon company and he actually consulted with me and Eric on some of our favorites from our favorite tunes from the Pokemon franchise and got a lot of feedback from us we worked with him to kind of develop a program for the concert and give a we gave him you know our opinions on what pieces worked what didn't for a live show and then the rest was all them they ran with all of the pieces that they come up with and arranged them all and orchestrated everything and honestly it was it having a Pokemon concert IRL that people could attend and listen to yeah I was super stoked so it may have seemed to on the outside that they might have been stepping on my toes but honestly it was it was super I thought it was super awesome that they were doing it and it was something I'd dreamed up for awhile and I actually hope that it pushed the Pokemon company towards doing more live recordings for the games themselves in the future after they've seen the reception to the the concerts you know it would be super neat to see them do more recording with live orchestra for future soundtracks so I think it's all progress what I do what symphonic evolutions is doing and I sort of see that as the concert series as an extension of kind of what I do but more for an act like a concert going experience versus something where you're like sitting down and my albums have a narrative to them which is not the case with symphonic evolutions there are a couple of movements like the black and white movement that you're very cinematic and story driven but for the most part it's like you know the best hits of the Pokemon series where as I like to I like to take you know music from a single gen and focus in on that and try to distill the essence of a particular game like red and blue or right now gold and silver and develop a listening experience that has a kind of story as a the backbone for all of the tracks before we get to your current Kickstarter which has about a week left ah how do you get maybe maybe there's a really simple answer maybe it's really complicated and we'll take too much time but you're selling pretty much pokemon music and tcpi knows that you're doing it obviously mm-hmm how is that not a conflict of interest of like yeah you changed the music slightly well not slightly I'm sure there's so much work oh yeah no it's not slightly but again what you're saying yeah how is how is there not like hey take this music down you're making money off off what what was originally something we created right and the whole legality of releasing covers whether it's video game music or covers of pop songs things like that those can be licensed which is exactly what we've done for my past releases we've so we have what is called a compulsory license and I'm working with Sebastian wool from the materia collective which releases a bunch of original and cover albums of video game music and basically he and my past labels handle the licensing where we take a composition that is featured in a song of mine so say I have like the main theme the main pokemon theme from red and blue and I want to you know release that and sell that on iTunes and put it on Spotify and stuff so the compulsory license mechanical license allows you to cite one composition for nine cents per sale digital sale of the album or the track getting into like complex business e copyright stuff but yeah so for nine cents per composition featured in a track you can then license that track and release it and so basically what we do is we list all of the compositions we're licensing that have been published by the Pokemon company already on iTunes because as you might know they they actually have all of the soundtracks or most of the soundtracks on iTunes for the Pokemon games yeah to eat we cite those compositions and license all of those add up the total amount of royalties owed to the Pokemon company and then basically cut them a check every month after all of the sales from the music comes and I would I would hope that somebody does that for you like you're not yeah you're not sitting there in your studio going well we sold three of the title screen for red and blue so that's 27 cents it's uh ya know um my previous label louder handled all of my licensing for me and Sebastian who was a co-founder of louder is now handling licensing for me he is a spreadsheet wizard so it's a and he's got everything automated so he he's the one who kind of handles all of that he he doesn't weigh more efficiently than I could and most people know musicians are probably not great accountant so the as if everything is legally licensed and available for sale with all proper royalties paid to the Pokemon company got it I'm just I guess I'm kind of surprised that you know other composers is that the right word other composers don't do that with other video games like you don't see halo remixes or destiny remixes or final phantom a B I'm just not looking hard enough but mmm if it's that easy of saying hey I just want to license this and I'm going to cut you a check for you know nine cents of the dollar per song you would think that more of those would be popping up yeah and I think for a while it was just about accessibility to the kinds of labels and partners publishers that gave artists the ability to license songs for covers louder was one of the first really big online retailers and labels that allowed musicians to do video game covers and so it was it's I think it's becoming a lot more prevalent now and before it was pretty unheard of so yeah it's uh it's pretty cool actually seeing all of the kinds of covers that come out for video games nowadays like I'm playing persona 5 right now when I'm not working on the album like I'll take breaks to play persona and I'll go on Twitter and see people like posting vocal covers of persona songs and it's really cool to now see this thriving community of video game artists and Rangers and cover bands and things doing interpretations of all this video game music in various genres not just you know orchestral things yeah it's it's pretty awesome [Music] speaking of Awesome Johto legends music from pokemon gold and pokemon silver currently on Kickstarter we're recording we're recording this a little early so right now it says nine days left you have 574 backers you're at 20,000 dollars out of 30,000 so goal goal is definitely obtainable here but tell me tell me about this Kickstarter so this is a project that is near and dear to my heart like I mentioned earlier I my first choice if I was going to you know exclude the opinions of other people and be really super selfish I would have tackled the music of gold and silver first because it was such an important it was such an integral part of my childhood exploring the johto region and encountering the legendaries like ho-oh and lugia and all the you know the beast trio they raikou and suicune and up until this point I actually didn't feel competent enough in my musical abilities to pull off an album of gold and silver orchestrations that really did the music justice so now I feel like I'm ready and I've written I'm almost done with the album now and what I want to do is take it to the next level not just have virtual instruments like I've used in the past but kind of do something in-between say canto symphonies virtual instruments and double-teams all live ensemble where it's a mix so this Kickstarter is to raise funds for live musicians to perform parts for Johto legends all music from pokemon gold and silver and it's also to raise funds to produce a physical CD copies of the album when it's released so people can get these really beautiful albums with it's going to feature some stunning album artwork by the double-team cover designer Franz Anthony and are also super excited to just you know be um sorry I lost my train of thought so the met the mastering of cutting and editing I'll make you sound real good actually speaking of mastering and editing that's that's also part of the Kickstarter uh good segue actually for the first time in my musical career we want to raise funds to hire a professional sound engineer to mix and master the album as opposed to me just like slapping a compressor and a you know limiter and calling it good for I that might be lost on some people but like a hundred percent know what you need in that aspect it's just kind of a quick and dirty like oh yeah the album's done sure it's like peaking meaning like there's some distortion in the audio but like I'll just turn it down a little bit it's all good it's good right no no so we're we want to get it professionally mixed and mastered so the whole album is produced to the highest quality possible-- so when you put on your headphones you really get sucked into the music the the stereo field is wide and everything is rich in detail then it's it's nothings fuzzy and or compressed so yeah basically make it sound as good as possible do physical CDs and higher live players to perform along side orchestral really high quality orchestral samples well that's awesome well that is currently on Kickstarter probably just my advice would probably be searching for Johto legends that will probably get you right there on Kickstarter I'll have a link to the Kickstarter in the show notes thank you so much yeah we're uh we're coming down to the wire on this one yeah yeah totally but but we'll make sure that our Twitter and everything gets gets us promoted for your last week it's always like the first like couple days is another last couple days those are the most important yeah I'm not too worried honestly because most people do kind of like pledge at the last minute so I'm that guy I used to pledge first minute and I have now completely I will wait till last minute every time oh yeah oh I do it too I'm totally guilty so it's it's understandable to when people and I think it's part of Kickstarter statistics or something - when every project that kind of reaches half of its goal you know within a week or two of its a deadline is usually going to get funded is the statistic or something like that yeah it's because people you know want to see if the project is worthwhile and if it's going somewhere and if it hits the 50 percent mark that's kind of like a signal to people like oh yeah this this is something we really really want to push through but couldn't make up their mind before it hit super-sized totally I got one measure of faith yeah I got one more question for you Braxton before we wrap it up here uh what is your favorite Pokemon ah how dare you there I asked these hard questions this is you're pitting me against all the other Pokemon fans out there who like how specific gens are your favorite oh god like I don't want to say this because it'll make it sound like I'm a gen 1 or when I'm really a Gen 2 ha ha but I I really love Charizard I've been like wow yeah I've been drawing Charizard fan art since I was a little kid since I could like I watched the Pokemon anime before I ever played the games in Charizard was probably my favorite Pokemon back then too so oh yeah definitely Charizard I was on bad choice I mean the atleast didn't pick like Lucario or something ah no hating on Lucario yeah we have a long-running joke where the whole show hates Lucario but in reality currently in reality he's okay he's he puts ia market if I had to pick a newer Pokemon that was my favorite I would probably say beware oh yeah beware is really great it's like one of the few things the anime does really good is like give gives justice to certain Pokemon oh my gosh yeah beware is one of those the Sun in Moon anime is so good I love the animation and like yeah like you said the the Pokemon characters themselves they actually like feel alive and have personalities beware is the greatest part of the anime and they're the team rocket's relationship would be we're just like oh it's so cute I'm a little behind on the end of my have to catch up I've only done the I've only done the first three so when they introduced beware in Episode three yeah it's um it's pretty great that's awesome well braxton thank you for being on where can our listeners find you I know you're on Twitter and your your music has a Twitter account as well yeah so you can follow Pokemon reor castrated all of our shenanigans and music on Facebook just like a Pokemon reor castrated also on twitter our handle is at pkmn re orc you can just type in Pokemon reor castrated um it's not an easy name to say when a search is surprisingly good yeah it'll it'll return it and then if you for some reason want to follow me and think I'm you know cool my my personal handle is at Braxton Berks awesome well thank you so much for being on I hope the most success for you and your Kickstarter Steve thank you so much for having me and I hope the podcast goes well we can only hope so will do is we will take a quick break and when we come back we will do some emails and our Pokemon of the week we will be right back [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and we are back from our break let's let's talk about the hit mobile game Magikarp jump which I might attempt like I might call splash Magikarp because that's what it was in Japan I actually like I like that name better I realize why it's so awkward because isn't splash itself the original move a mistranslation wasn't it always supposed to be jump and that's why things like hoppip know it but it was mistranslated as splash and so that the whole joke of the game sort of gets lost because why is Magikarp jumping well it's because it always has we just didn't know it's weird whatever yeah so in Japan magikarps movies jump in America they translated it to splash which is wait would you like me to read the official Bubba paediatrician yeah go ahead while it's English name suggests in association with water it's Japanese name squiggly squiggly squiggly Janero can mean both splash and hop but usually the latter this explains why the move can be learned by Pokemon such as spoink and hop it species who have no association with water but are known for hopping or jumping and why it is disabled by gravity it's somewhat misleading English name is likely due to its initial exclusivity to Magikarp it's almost like that's exactly what I already said yes but I just read the official word that's not official media video yeah okay so I also I I take umbrage with your describing this as a game it's certainly fun and cute it is just a skinner box though right it's just I mean it's a temper that's the buttons you press the buttons that the game tells you to press and you get rewarded for it and there's no skill or anything of the sort involved except for the occasional decision to play it safe or have your Magikarp die like other than that it's just I think you press the buttons the game tells the quote-unquote game tells you to press I like it a lot but I don't really know that it's a game you're not you're not wrong it is a game in a sense that it's a capper like shrimps we're very big I was very big shrimps for a very long time at I still playing still will and half later we'll still playing but in shrimps don't you have to make like a lot of decisions there's not really a lot of decisions to even be made and so the thing about Pritam is and most other tapper I've played a lot of tappers like eggs ink is another one that stands out to me the thing about those games is you can usually brute-force them with time Magikarp jump doesn't do anything on its own which is a little annoying in that aspect like I don't like I'm already pointing out negatives and I'm very high on this game don't get me wrong but at least in like trims you can your trims don't do anything at the start and then you hire like two trims and then you're clicking to make them do stuff and then eventually with women I say eventually I mean like the first five minutes of the game the trims are self efficient to work on their own and what you're doing at that point is is once they're bringing back resources you're hiring more trips or building more buildings or or you're spending those resources so as you spend the resources they accomplish those goals faster which gets you more trims and more resources and then that builds but you even let those games idle and get reward for it yeah but you can't do that in Magikarp jump because everything for which you get a reward requires a tap yes and just like in shrimps you well you could let it idle and eventually get to your goal I mean if you were applying for a straight day you'd probably get there but you could let it idle for like two weeks and then get there without actually clicking the thing about shrimps is you do hit a wall and you go through a portal and when you come out of that portal you're starting over sounds familiar right but you're getting some of the benefits that you did on your last run those go into your new run and it makes it easier to then get past that brick wall hit a new brick wall go through the portal come back around the same thing for eggs ink the same thing for other tappers magic Karp jump exactly like that your Magikarp can only jump so high once that's over you start over and a little bit goes into that new Magikarp and I mean there there are the the game part comes with I would say the game part comes with the the spending of okay where am I going to put my coins yeah that's true or where what am I going to buy with my diamonds which is a little more rare what decoration do I want to go in because I definitely think some decorations are way better than other decorations yeah that's true and really some of the first decorations that you can afford off the bat while you can afford them and put them down I think that you hurt yourself in the long run of like Oh instead of 150 you should have saved to 250 because this decoration will benefit you way more than the other decorations yeah and if for those maybe that are still at the beginning I think the two best decorations are the shame and planter yeah got that one and the whimsicott cushion I don't have that one yet the whimsicott cushion I think is the best one to buy first because it increases your trainer XP points by 9% that's the only thing that increases your overall trainer XP and as you know your Magikarp level is based off your trainer XP right faster you can get that up because there have been some runs where I got my trainer level up twice yeah am I on that s-s-san model though I just think it looks cool huh you guys are so much further in this game than I have gotten what race what rank are we all education yeah look I'm I'm level 3 rank 3 for your trainer yeah okay Travis what rank are you 21 I am rank 22 woo which I can see cuz I linked my leaderboard to Facebook and then had the Wall of shame thrown up in front of me yeah that's that's such a like that's such a mobile gimmick tactic of like here's what your friends are doing and it's like ah I just played here so how much better your friends are then you write as you feel bed in the morning well your last on my list just let you know yeah I believe it because I'm trainer level three and I've played this game for like a max of like an hour maybe I don't know it sounds like you don't like it though well as somebody who has you've played a lot of trims you're still playing trims cracked so I feel like this game would be in your wheelhouse this game requires far too much interaction for me trims I can let it sit on my work computer it's running on my work computer right now without me being there and you know what those little trips are making food then they're making metal and they're making wood and I had to do anything about it my grandfather magikarps just slack and he doesn't he doesn't even know how to eat unless I put the food Chomp here's uh well I think we recognize those berries it's uh is it a chest oh and uh now what's the bliz a lot of oh I mean you got you got your orange you got your oh that's right because I haven't bought the more berries I've only got the two basic berries like Oran and citrus to start and then you can buy Pecha and then eventually you get like Rostand I think oh there's a link lebas well and then a raw roster berries what I'm on I think you can get it when you're 22 we pull it up little on the list you know what I'd really like to talk about how I solo captured a Suresh seven star Sergius this morning but that's just not the topic I had no idea what that even means so good so the berries that you have access to start with Oran berry and Sitrus berry and then you can buy petra berries window berries walk and berries those are the ones that make it so that electric-type moves super-effective moves are their damages have a lepa berries Rost berries and then and that's how far I am in terms of my berry access but then you get a spare batteries batteries I don't know I said it like a human's name berry raspberry blackberry and then finally it's a lava cookie when you hit that a la streaming or t2 wouldn't the lava cookie get real soggy underwater I mean it's uh it's it's it's baked so crispy by the lava that okay you need that SOG maybe like a dunking an Oreo and milk yeah yeah but you're on a pretty strict time limit with that evening imagine your cares about the sogginess of a lava cookie probably not but you don't know about that Piplup you don't know if that Piplup stealing food you didn't get Piplup eating my food I didn't agree to this Piplup to be in my tank whoo that's a good point haven't gotten the Piplup yet I think you got a B is it the first or second tournament that gives you the Piplup I think it's the first tournament you you do I mean I've done I've done the first league okay so let me got to be the second let me let me give you a pro tip here so if you go under achievements there's a bunch of achievements for like number of times you log in times fed times trained events triggered patterns collected there's one that says social media shares okay so I'm not doing that here here's the pro tip here's the pro tip because I want to I want to get all the achievements did you make a Twitter account just for Magikarp jump shares no no I have a better way Travis I am this is breaking news no one you're hearing this first this is something I tested last night I was so excited to report on this the social media I've not seen this anywhere and and for the record I have looked up very little information on Magikarp jump because I I do like just like trips you can say that shrimps or eggs Inc are there games that play themselves right but there are still things that you don't know what happens and that like that's exciting like going through the portal for the first time and trips is like whoa I did not expect this and then getting new items and trim sub like oh I can get a mansion now I never had a mansion before like those are exciting and I think the same thing applies here too Magikarp jump of Oh something happens when bah bah bah like the first time you do one of the training events that you just unlocked it was like oh this is cool or even like I don't know what a Charizard does until I buy it or at least I think it doesn't tell you what they do yes for you yeah them it doesn't yeah that doesn't tell you what you do so I'm looking through the list you see a lot like I items use magikarps forced to retire social media shares so the first one I think you need to do three the second one you need to do 10 the third one you need to do 50 or not 20 the fourth one you need to do 50 so I'm assuming the last one is you need to do a hundred so you can tweet those to get one point now I tested if you cannot do the same event twice so if you want a gym battle you can't tweet that like four times it only works for the first one so if you're going through a gym and there's 15 spots in the gym and you always lose at 16 you can do every single one of those gyms even if you've done them before as long as your Magikarp is wiped and you got a new Magikarp so that's 15 chairs but no way am i spamming either of my Twitter's Pokemon podcast or dragging a lake with it with over a hundred Magikarp notifications like I might do one a day but here's the trick you can text yourself or another person and that counts as a share what fYI I just texted both of you hahahahahahaha so Irene is going to wake up this morning and she's going to see about 20 Magikarp text from me but I tested and it counted every single time and then at that point I went I should probably stop texting her so I tested myself I texted myself and it worked so every time you do a gym battle or even a special event just text yourself that because you have to do over a hundred to complete that part of the achievements so there you go you heard it here first I was so excited when I discovered that last night I couldn't wait to podcast they will probably fix that hole soon enough well I mean texting is sharing so I don't see why it wouldn't take why that my precious Magikarp just jumped 34 meters and won hashtag Magikarp Travis you didn't play have you played any tapper prior to this I played games similar to this I played a tiny bit of tramps cookie clicker I played cookie clicker there's the one what's the is it adventure capitalist is that what that one's yeah yeah yes I games pretty all right I played a little that I didn't like that I played the more like I played them were I'm not sure I I think cookie clicker met it might have come out when I was like in high school or early college and I was a slacker so you know like some of that in class but I mean they're not they've it's never been a genre that engages me heavily but magikarp jump is cute and it has Pokemon in it so a lot of the times that's enough for me to forgive a lot of other things I wouldn't like another game so I'm playing it having a good time have you put em either of you put any money into it uh hello oh my gosh okay I have this I have this like when I like something I have zero problem giving it money and so when I logged in and I saw oh like for 72 hours I don't know if you guys saw this for 72 hours here's X amount of diamonds and a bunch of items for $4.99 and then for 72 hours because it's our special launch thing here's X amount of diamonds and some more items for $0.99 so right off the bat I was like somebody made this game and it's free and they have to get paid somehow and this is giving me item so this is my way of supporting the people who made said you let you do that for me also six dollars is cheaper than a meal at five guys so that's Jerry and everything that's cheaper than a meal at five guys your you should buy you should be buying money is no good in the bank yeah my problem is one I mean I just I don't like the game very much and - I only get paid once a month and this is what we call fifth week we're in it's the fifth week of the month since I've been paid and I'm getting hungry and it's either that meal at five guys are some Magikarp jumping maybe June will be Magikarp jumps month to make some cash off me this is a non sequitur but it's rowdy tackle is there a pun there there's a man in the game named rowdy tackle yeah and I realize tackle like tackle box rod fishing rod I am yeah the other thing I want to point out is what what it's the second it's not the sandbag it's the second one with the the counter yeah that counter is the same counter that's in pokemon stadium oh remember the minigame where you have to make Magikarp jump and whoever can hit a I didn't notice that that's cool like there's a lot of really like subtle things that I really enjoy about this game I don't maybe I'm misunderstanding the the manaphy when manaphy shows up you tap it and then it starts fever rush right and then all the love discs come and corsola yeah do you tap the love dis and corsola to get the food to drop or do you happen do you eat the food because you can only have so much food on your screen do you eat the food so when they're passing by they're dropping more food now I think food rush allows you to pass your cap of food production so you just have as many of the Pokemon as you can I think it seems like it's I always just tap the Pokemon and then eat the food that's there when I'm when it's over and I'm pretty dang sure there's more food than what there's more food than my current tanks cap would normally allow yes wildly tapping all the time tap tap tap tap tap tap tap I've never even paying attention to what I hit on I put a lot of my most of my coins are going straight into food because I'm checking so often that it's more of a payoff a fresh if you if you're checking at least twice a half-hour I would say if you're checking even once every half hour you get way more out of the food at least in my experience than you do from the training yeah if you if you check enough the other that but there are other strategies right like if you like you said if you don't check that often probably the training about our investment but then there's also the consideration of and I mean it would take someone to actually crunch the math on this but I would guess that there's also an argument to be had for buying your upgrades not necessarily for the specific thing you're buying but to just get things to rank 25 so that you get the support candy that upgrading something to that extent gets you so then your support Pokemon or butter like I think there's multiple ways to do it and I'm sure one of them is optimal but I'm not gonna bother figuring out what that is yeah yeah yeah the one thing I have that's a little outside of that is one time I did the training where it's the jump up and hit the counter and for some reason my Magikarp went absolutely wild and broke the counter and I got in 2000 JP yes from one training session which is like much much more than you would at any other time yeah that's but here's the thing if you don't ever upgrade that the counter and you hit that again 2,000 JP is like nothing once you hit like level 15 or 16 like it's like I can eat one berry there are there are two berries out of the six I have that when I eat that berry it's a thousand JP or well whatever it is so that yet to answer your question well every one of the training games games who every one of the training cutscenes has one of three results the most common result is just your basic so I think the counter one is a great example because it's very easy to see the basic result for counter is you get a hundred jumps the I think it's called a good result a great result is 500 jumps and then amazing effort just all nines overflowing yes green as as you mentioned and every one of those training cutscenes has its own variation of that like the dwell or bold or pushes it's just like how far the double or bold or gets pushed and then the punching bag is punched and off the chain bit yeah that timber one you either don't really make a dent in the tree or you do that's sort of and it Awards you larger amounts of JP as you note I think you break the trade down but they I don't think I've ever got an amazing effort on timber but yeah I think the tree is broken in half couple more things I want to talk about how many shiny gold magikarps have you guys gotten zero two or three and in what generation Magikarp are you on oh let me see it's a generation 23 okay so I'm at generation 21 that's interesting because I did the I did the wind XP you did the exp thing so you're probably right that I should have bought that yeah I'm also bought diamonds so yes I was it was very easy for me to afford that pretty quickly because I think it's one of the more expensive ones have you lost one of magikarps to Pidgeot or Voltorb ah I want to say four or five that's that's what I want to talk about so I only had one gold Magikarp since then it seems that everyone in slack has gotten at least one gold Magikarp but a couple people have gotten two or three and I believe the golden Magikarp correct me if I'm wrong when you have it every time it collects coins it collects more coins yeah that's I mean each Magikarp has an individual bonus in addition to the motivation bonus that's tied to your trainers rank and the individual bonus changes depending on you know which Magikarp you have but the gold magic hearts individual bonus is always an increase in the percentage of coins that you receive yeah the most of the bonuses are like oh you get your 150 bonus for being on Magikarp number 16 or whatever but then you this Magikarp has amassed no not like ever eat even your average Magikarp has yeah in addition at the motivation that's the number below it right there are a lot of events in the game there's the event where Magikarp gets lost there's the event where Magikarp can eat the food off the tree there's the event where Magikarp sees something in the water sees a poker ball on the ground that we're tag-team battle that like always goes the same way every single time and I have again I haven't looked much up so I mostly because I'm enjoying the surprises that come to me let's talk about the tree so the tree Magikarp can jump to eat the fruit and that usually pays out pretty good JP and that event does scale with your level so if your level 20 you're going to get a ton of JP compared to when you're level 2 I mean you get a lot of JP for being level 2 but that event scales with your level you run the risk of Pidgeot taking your Magikarp and losing and start I wonder what the rate for that if maybe I just have really bad luck but it seems like more often I get the rond the deal in the Voltorb and Pidgeot events I've never I think I did I think I went for it three times with the tree always got Pidgeot or Pidgeotto I can't remember which it is and then for the Voltorb one I was just curious if it ever actually gave you coins so I just did every time it came up presuming I wasn't at my Magikarp wasn't like a super-high level and that thing exploded in my face I think like five or six five times before I actually got coins out of it Wow yeah I feel like for me all of them feel feel pretty 5050 feel pretty heads and tails will have you experienced the the pidgeotto Pidgeot event nope okay where the Voltorb event don't know what they are okay so sometimes after you finish a training session your guy will go oh Magikarp let's take the long way home and then that sparks one of these events and one I've gotten that for the like let's swim home and then it's like all the the glitters yes one okay that is not dangerous yeah the the so the glitter one will give you diamonds and the punishment is it reduces JP from you it'll say like oh you lost mm JP and it's like okay that's 30 seconds of my time lost the the that ones always do it always always do that one I would say that the tree is never worth doing I don't think it's ever worth jumping for the fruit because again you can usually eat that fruit within like wait five minutes wait for your fruit to fill up in the water eat all that and that usually equals the fruit you could have got from the tree that's how I feel about it I'll have to take your word for it I will not jump for fruit in the tree the only way I would jump for fruit is if like my magic like if it's I just got the magic harp and it's a basic magic harp and it's like level 15 or something where it's like okay this is my very first day with this magic harp I ate I don't have any training or I have one training I decided that might be the only way because of its like if if my magic harp gets taken I would be back at the beginning and it's possible that I could get a better magic harp than just the basic magic harp that I was just given 30 seconds ago that would be the only reason why I would jump now the Voltorb I think the volt herbs always worth doing so what happens is like you're mad your magic harp will see a pokeball and it will say like investigate or not investigate and if you hit investigate it's like are you sure yes or no and then it could either be a volt or which will explode and kill your magic harp just like Pidgeotto takes your magic harp away or it pays out coins and usually a lot of coins and again just like the tree the coins scale with your level so when you're at level 2 you would get maybe 20 or 30 coins out of I should say your trainer level or generation level not your actual magic harp level your rank so your rank so if you're Rank 2 or generation 3 for your magic harp you might only get 20 or 30 coins but when you rank 21 generation 20 it's going to pay out like 320 coins and besides like getting 10 to 12 coins every 5 levels in the pool and getting like 15 to 16 coins per battle the 200 coins is a lot in 200 or 300 coins is kind of a lot in compared to what you normally get from just going through the game like the only way I wouldn't know I feel like I would I feel like I would always do the voltar I don't think there a situation not because the worst the worst thing that happens is you just start over and it doesn't I guess doesn't really matter but I mean like I don't think I would do it if I had been sitting on a magic art for a long time right like if it like if like I'm at a point where takes me a while to like level 31 is the cap I can get to with this magic harp and if I were like level 30 and I got the Volturi event event I probably wouldn't yeah so here's my thing so I I have a generation 21 magic harp the rank I can get to is level 32 and I have two more Jim I have two more battles left to beat the great League or whatever is whatever's after the heavy League yeah grande einen I know that this level 32 magic harp can beat the second-to-last trainer but I know this magic harp can't beat the 'final trainer yeah this magic harp can go one battle further but to me seeing those coins and taking that risk isn't that big of a punishment because I know my my next magic harp can beat that trainer and the next trainer anyways yeah some deep this is very high level magic heart math that's a bit beyond me I don't think the one where magic harp gets lost there's no punishment for that you can either like search as there is there no punish you can either search for magic harp or you can wait and hope that magic harp finds its way home I've done both multiple times sure if you do wait I'm pretty sure if you do wait you're always found at least every time I've done way I've always been found by mayor by the mayor I think if you search there's a chance the I haven't seen it but I imagine there's a chance you don't get found and then maybe you lose some Jake I've never lost yeah I've never lost any when I do like my search is when mayor comes no other way around yeah if you wait then the mayor comes yes if you search then Magikarp will find you find you you're the trainer yeah and I think you get more JP if Magikarp finds you cuz your guy goes like Oh magic harp so self-sufficient right but I don't know what happens in Magikarp is unable to find you as I guess what I'm saying presuming that's an option yeah I've never had that there's the event where where you can yell at Magikarp so it's like why would you do that cuz he's slacking yeah so you can yell at Magikarp or not yell sometimes when you yell you get a training point back and then sometimes when you yell Magikarp loses JP cuz he's sad and then if you don't yell you just get JP for not yelling is what I've come to yep and tag battle I don't know how that works cuz every time I do tag battle Magikarp splashes nothing happens Pikachu Thunder shocks the video to same it's the same event time it's just you get some bonus JP for watching a cut suit I would be curious if you got like that Charizard or if you got that Bulbasaur or the kind of Lytton and Litton never shows up okay all right what does Litton do the same thing that pikachu does but but with more JP and on a higher cooldown hmm oh I mean that's just in in the pond is I guess what I'm saying yet I would but lit Litton Litton has never shown up in tag battle it's okay Pikachu okay good to know uh anything else you guys want to talk about I just need to get further in this game so people please stop asking me for answers because I ain't got them uh well get that like I said get that whimsicott plush cuz I think that one as you can tell from Travis's design an arse number are the Lola as you can tell from the numbers between Travis and I the whimsicott plush clearly matters yeah there's not a difference not that that's that big of a deal right you're just you're just going through more carp right and maybe I'm going through carp more quickly than ru because cuz voltar keeps exploding because of well that too but also maybe the items that I've bought right like let me look at the other decorations I have let's compare our aquariums fish tanks I have I have design yeah I have the octillery pot I have the sign that they give you yep um and then I have the Shaymin okay planter and then I have Litton Pikachu and obviously Piplup okay so I have octillery the sign Shaymin whimsicott and the executor planter and that I've just had Pikachu on top the executor planter gives you more coins per gym battle yeah and since I knew that I would be going through from league battles yeah 12% since I knew I would be going through that great league a hundred times because I think it's yes fifteen or twenty battles that I figured that would be a payoff there yeah but you just wait on televisions and it's it's it's tough because like I made the choice to get Litton not knowing what Litton does and I and Linton finding out that Linton does the same thing as Pikachu is like okay cool but it's like I wish I hadn't I wish I had known kind of you coming would you have done something else uh I mean I I probably would have just saved up for a different Pokemon because I like having the Pokemon pals over just a decoration that sits there passively okay I think I know what Charizard does but I don't want to spoil it for people I don't I a couple complaints about the game like I like I said earlier I I adore this game it's kind of everything I want cuz I do like tapper so much I don't like that Piplup sin the water with me I don't like it either because then when manaphy comes you accidentally tap it and then it's like oh hi there it looks like you're trying to tap a Piplup well you should check the amount of trainings you got out there store it up in your sleeve because you already got the maximum so you're gonna have to hit this ok' button and by the time you've already just dismissed this message right here that I'm reading to you all the course will have gone on their merry way and you're not getting any food out of this food fever yep that is my exact complaint like I wish Piplup was more surface area or like just get out of my way also sometimes I don't want to get out of my way to floss sometimes I don't want to use your power like sometimes I've only I like sometimes I have two out of three training sessions and I want to use those other two training sessions before I use your power Piplup because it's possible that those true training sessions can get me to max level and then I can go do my great and then you get your get my Magikarp Deb come back and then you're still active because I haven't used you yet but sometimes man if he comes and I silly click you and now I wasted that training session because I know that food fever will get me to that max level and get out of my way girl triple I'm giving Piplup no candy all my Candy's going to Pikachu because I like Pikachu's power way more than pip loves power you'll probably like Litton the other complaint I have which is a kind of a minor one is this game is really slow yet is yeah like going between training sessions to like walking home to going between even gyms you've already done it has that skip feature which is great but then it shows you the record at the end and then it closes and then your trainer slowly walks the next gym it's it's kind of hard to get in and out really quickly like I can get in and out and eat that's not a problem it's once you start doing training sessions or gym battles it just feels so sluggish and it like I know my iPhone can run this game I know it's not the limitation of the hardware it's the actual software itself yeah but that's that's really my only complaint my bag mate my man complains a Piplup needs get out of my way and I just wish the menus were a little bit faster otherwise like for a Pokemon game I think it's great I played a little bit of mola mola last week like I said I was I would and even though it's a very similar game it's it's kind of like the the comparison to ingress and Pokemon go they're pretty much the same games but that Pokemon connection just makes it feel like it has so much more character so much more depth it's just really great I'm really enjoying it I feel like I will get to rank 51 which is the max rank at this point I don't feel burnt out on it even though I've probably played it I don't even know how long I played it a lot sounds like Travis has played a lot too based on yeah your rank I didn't think we'd spend 41 minutes talking about massacre flash or just magic herb jumps sorry it's really great we'll probably have more to say next week when we get in we don't need any emails correcting us that we're wrong or you're you know telling us what things are it is very clear that we could look these things up I just think that at least Travis and I who are farthest in the game we're choosing not to look things up because of the sense of surprise like Travis could easily looked up what Litton did right I could easily look up whatever but I'm at the point where I kind of want to be surprised I'm sure that will end maybe in the next week where I just want to look stuff up and min/max stuff but at this point you know no need for emails telling us what things do like I know who I know where the resources are I'm just choosing not to look at them so if we got anything wrong apologies we got a lot of emails this last week but we're running along I don't want to run terribly long so we're only going to do two or three here if you haven't right now are you ready well I'm ready if you have an email you can write to us SBJ at pkmn cast calm or you can go to Pokemon podcast calm and hit that contact button both will get to us I said we had an email about the anime so this email is from Ben from Atlanta Georgia a little bit of a long email but here we go this is says hey guys on episode 266 you discuss the quality of the Pokemon anime and whether the Sun and Moon series was better than its previous iterations not to reopen a wound but here are some I thought here are some of my thoughts and an example of how kids may feel about the show TV shows are a storytelling medium so for some for for so far a season of a show to be considered better storytelling should be part of its evaluation now the storytelling is by all accounts terrible on the show and frankly in most of the games as well to be fair Pokemon as a franchise has never been about story but more about atmosphere and atmosphere of an imagined world where people can control actions of mystical animals and bond over their shared experiences a cool premise for an entire game definitely but since the anime is missing an interactive element that the game has you need to add a lot more in the mix to be entertaining the procedural show's follow a formula they would likely they would be impossible impossibly expensive to make them if they didn't following a formula doesn't mean you should also have bad dialogue and bland characters the people who write the Pokemon haven't really ventured beyond the basic premise the games presented until they do the show will continue to be terrible however evaluating any piece of media other elements are at play so the new season is better in some facets basically sound design art style but overall it's still an absolute piece of garbage as endo little evidence sorry about that getting got a little something my throat there I was watching the first episode of the sudden moon with my brother-in-law because my wife has a blended family he is rather young at ten years old he loves Pokemon to the point where he has all the matchup types memorized watches battle videos on YouTube constantly collects and plays the card game even plays the brick bronze version of Pokemon on his phone the third-party game he watched quite a few episodes of the show so we're watching the episode I assume he loves it since the app that he's absolutely in the target demographic for the show then around 10 minutes in the episode he says I've never been so bored he's a smart kid and says funny phrases like this a lot and I figured he just needed to be coaxed to watch a little bit more and maybe he'd get it invested into the plot we watched another five minutes and he asked if we can stop watching it and gratefully oblige his request it's just one example but even somebody completely primed to a very lease sort of liked the show found it absolutely boring in closing dear God do never talk about the anime in your podcast been all I would have to say in response to this email is that child is obviously very gifted and above average intelligence for his age and that's that's all there you go are you say that's that kid dumb kids watch Pokemon yes average kids watch Pokemon I just say that I there's nothing in that email that I'd really disagree with I think that's mainly the point I was making that sure we can concede that the storyline itself hasn't improved but other aspects of the show have and that I in the because so many people jump on the Pokemon show exclusively I think it's okay for me to be a voice that says hey these other aspects of the show other than storyline have improved that's and i think i think it's it's worth saying that I only dumped on the show I don't know I think that words dump I only dumped on the show because I do want it to be better it's only going to Magikarp because it was slacking yeah I get a yell at my Magikarp everything I want the training points I'm not gonna disparage anyone who criticizes the show I just don't see that many people saying I just don't see as many people noting like how much funnier the show is in this season than it has been so I see more voices saying continuing to criticize the story and I think they're correct I don't see that many voices saying hey look the jokes had better the characters are more well drawn like Lilly's arc actually makes has she has like a character arc in the sense that she's scared of Pokemon at first and then I won't spoil what happens later but you can guess like that like there are things that happen in this season that make me happy and I haven't felt that way for previous seasons I don't see many people talking about that so I am happy to be the apologist for those aspects of the show I don't think that that's necessarily mutually exclusive with my agreeing that the storyline itself is it very interesting although I will continue to defend to some extent the formulaic or repetition type story because that's like a there's a tradition of that in kids media so I guess those are my only points so I don't really have many disagreements with this email yeah you know the thing the thing I was voicing last week was the the actual story that that goes into Pokemon and I said last week I so said in slack like kids aren't dumb kids can follow a story pretty well they're you know I was her pretty dumb let's debate that cuz they are I was eight nine years old following you know a Dragonball Z story and Kairat you know I just do it I just do a decent Vegeta and thought I should yeah I was smart enough to realize that Dragon Ball Z is nothing but filler you remember that expire episode in the Majin Buu saga that was just Goku going super saiyan 3 and his hair grows a little bit at the end where the good like 10 minutes of the episode are just like shots of like abandoned cities as like birds are flying and then you hear Goku yelling in the distance just going and my favorite episode of the show as much filler as Dragon Ball Z is they do a really good job at like at least hooking you and making you want to watch the next one that is correct so I did my home I did my homework look I'm not gonna come on the show and complain about something without experiencing it it was like the same thing from no man's sky I knew no man's sky was garbage I bought it anyways because I needed to know I needed I wasn't gonna sit there and say no man sky is garbage without playing no man's sky like I wanted to know so I watched the Matteson Pokemon anime some Sun and Moon this week and I said I said this before I enjoyed the first two episodes my main complaint was the theme song didn't really dig it you know what I've warmed up to the theme song it's growing on me I don't think it's as good as Pikachu leaving Patrat hanging dry but it has moments and to say what Travis said there's things in the show that has made them happy in aspects I totally see that when lana saved spoiler when lana saved popular pop lido from team skull that was a very heartwarming moment of like yeah Populi that's my boy pop leo sweet I like Papa Leo a lot glad Papa yo is not getting harassed by team skull that is heartwarming that's really good beware I went back rewatch that mimic mimic you episode again beware fantastic I want to see more of you we're not uh I'm not a fan of Wobbuffet Wobbuffet has had their time to shine I can agree to that sure my the other thing is I still do care about the story and my argument against Travis was yes I'm there's no denying the animation is better there's no denying the voice-acting most of it's better I wouldn't soft I can't speak to that because I haven't seen the dub Sophocles American voice actor is is one of the most nails on a chalkboard thing I've ever heard in my life I never want that character to speak rotom Dex is extremely charming there's like a point where ash goes oh man this is so awesome and Rotom Dex is like I don't know what awesome means and Kaku is like awesome means like great and Rotom Dex is like oh so awesome means great Rotom Dex is so great and then like repeats that throughout the show or he's like I'm great and it's like all right that's that's really good so I'm going to continue to watch Sonny moon I am still going to be critical about how that story is being told and if it's if it if it breaks that form I'm not saying it needs to break the formula and it needs to be an oscar-winning show but when I think because TV shows man amis not Oscars that's the I want Pokemon to be the first TV show to win an Oscar is what I'm saying moving all right my main complaint against Travis's argument was I don't like I said I don't think that in improving while it might matter I don't think approving the animation or the voice or whatever is that much of a step and I only think about that as like look at a show like Pitt my ride I'd rather not so exhibit comes exhibits easier $1,000 beter and exhibit pimps that ride and all of a sudden your car is looking good the Pokemon Sun emit a Sun a moon anime is looking good that car probably has a toaster oven in it Pokemon Sun and Moon they have toaster ovens that beware that's my toaster oven I'm glad beware has been added to the show I'm glad a toaster oven is in my car they add a bunch of subwoofers in the back of your pimped out ride Pokemon anime adds pop leo you know anytime populo says pop leo I'm down with that but at the core your car is still a junker because exhibit doesn't touch your engine so while you might have the best-looking car while the Sun and Moon anime might look really good that story the drive of that story the drive of your car is still garbage and I'll totally agree I just I just think not as many people are out there saying oh cool it has a toaster now like I don't see many people saying that so I will be that person and I think it's important that people recognize that there are those improvements even if as you say those improvements aren't core to the experience of the show I think media when we're especially visual media and like TV and movies especially are such a composite of different elements right like so many people work on them in so many different aspects like someone who is you can have a job as like the animator right and you have you can't like touch the story at all which is so different than if you were like writing a book because the one person has control over every element but we're talking about mediums that are this collaborative I still think it's very important to eat to talk about the toaster ovens and the subwoofers because there's people whose entire job is to make that subwoofer and to make that toaster oven and I don't hear many voices that are praising the work of those folks and I think that because those aspects have improved it's important that some people praise them I'm happy to be that person I am never going to look too Pokemon as being like an amazing storytelling vehicle because I get that from other things and I'd I would be stunned if Pokemon ever got to a place where I thought this is good storytelling so I'm it would be unhealthy for my soul to constantly harbor a distaste for Pokemon storylines because it's not going to change so I'm willing to praise them for the things that are changing it are improving does that make sense yeah yeah totally it could change because it's now on Cartoon Network right you mean Disney XD Disney XD yes really I pulled this email what I only pulled this email so I could make the pimp my I wanted to bring up him my ride is really I think that's a very good analogy actually no easy yes and like I said I I'm just a happy I'm happy there's a toaster oven now yeah I've seen now four or five episodes of the Sun Moon anime I actually do want to watch more I'm critical everything so uh well you know we might bring it back up in the future who knows let's just do one more email just cuz we're running so long Richard writes in from Greater Manchester UK here's a oh here's the thing do people call it the UK or do they call it Great Britain ah they certainly call it the UK depending on which part of it they're in is UK a little bit technically those uniting two different things yeah United Kingdom includes Northern Ireland Scotland Britain and Wales polka which are like like it's kind of like if you were just saying um is it ok if people call it big Wisconsin even though it's like Minnesota I say they're they're different states so the UK is like the USA and then Britain is like a state yeah no no no no no no no no no you like like why nice because I don't I don't win let's go no Britain is a country not a state of you know but I'm just saying you know like no brittle Britain is not a country Wendling I do not a country ountry England is a country so it is written great brazen is the name of the island like the geographic island of Great Britain which contains England Scotland Wales but yeah and then Ireland's over there on Ireland because they never gave that part back so like Northern Ireland or Ireland generally is not included in Great Britain which is just the island that has England Scotland and Wales so that's why you say the United Kingdom because that includes that nation's territory in Ireland specifically Northern Ireland does that make sense so if I say I might also be wrong but I think if I say if I say UK I'm kind of covered yeah yes whereas if I say England or Great Britain I might offend people that are in Ireland yeah if someone wrote in from Glasgow and you're like oh you wrote in from England they probably wouldn't be too happy I said yeah if they wrote in from Cardiff I'm a little car if I have no clue where these places are Richard right Zebedee dear SBJ and team I have I'm a new fan have been listening since January of 2017 thank you so much Richard you have made my weekly 600 mile round-trip commute to work bearable I hope it's not like 600 mile a day now he said weakly now weekly once a week that's like 100 miles a day though pure well six days a week anyways I particularly a bla bla I particularly enjoy your live streams from conventions such as packs I've also I have also started to watch Digimon again and have been told by my girlfriend that I am cheating on Pokemon however I have room in my heart for both I am a firm believer that no one is too old for Pokemon and my team should consist of the ones you love rather than strong ones this has given me fairly poor results at online competitions however I am getting better I have a few questions for you one what is your favourite digimon mine is Kabuto Iman - will you attend any events or conventions in the UK three do you have any tips for somebody new to competitive especially if I'm trying to build a team based on Pokemon I like and four have you tried a Nuzlocke playthrough of any of the games if so what are your impressions of it in closing my favourite game is heart gold my favorite Pokemon is Gengar livid with the decision to remove its levitate ability I have no favorite for an ISE team as it makes it amazing with everyone of you being so different keep going and I'll attempt to find a wet burrito to try thanks Rick Oh skip the wet burrito dude no gotta go to the beltline bar grad I was yeah there you go I've never been to the beltline bar is the thing though I don't know enough about Digimon I've seen some of the original show what's the one where it's like floaty and doesn't digivolve into like way later Patamon probably let me see if that's the one in think it looks like the Pikachu bond Patamon is one that doesn't Padma is like the last one to digivolve in the first series yeah Patamon is my favorite yeah Patamon school pad minded evolves into Angelman that's what I said yeah ah my favourite digimon hmm I really like wizard man uh oh I really I like all the dark masters a lot which is pop-up puppetmon I think it's mega seed Ramon machined Ramon and pied Amon Pied Mons kind of the the weaker of the but puppetmon is really good and puppetmon story-arc is really really good too mm I like Zoo dome on which is the ultimate form of the cocoon Mon I like a lot of Digimon wizard mine is pretty great I problem I'll right now I would say was it mom uh will you attend any events in the UK well first we got to figure out what it is yeah I don't yeah I'm surprised there's not like a pax in the UK at this point I can I can assure you that definitely not in 2017 I have I have personally never been out of out of the United States that would be a first for me but I'm not I'm not opposed to it do you know the tips yeah that would be it do you have any tips for somebody new to the VGC based on Pokemon I like we've talked about this before I'll just give my two cents Travis and will you can chime in I would look at the meta that is currently pick one or two of those Pokemon probably like the legendary is being used or you know the garchomps of the world or they are canines and then pair that with the ones you like and try to get a good flow there that way you're not completely committing to the meta but you're also using Pokemon you like yeah I would I would basically say the same thing but in the reverse direction like look at the Pokemon you're gonna you're not going to be able to be that successful with a team unless the Pokemon you happen to like are the top is it like like and less than and let the Pokemon you like are already the meta you're probably not going to be able to use a team that's just six Pokemon that you like very much unfortunate well you can but you likely won't be very successful and I've that's a sad thing to say um but unless you're like really really good that's probably just true unfortunately so what I tend to do is pick one or two of those Pokemon that already have interest may be some interesting synergy together or maybe just one that you really really like and then build a team around it that can fit within the meta so for example the team I was using for quite a while I like vanilluxe luckily vanilluxe isn't that we actually talked about it last week for Pokemon of the week um and vanilluxe isn't that bad in the meta it's not one of the most used Pokemon but it gets some usage and then try to build out from there like vanilluxe has weaknesses so like what pokemon do i need to pair it with to shore up those shore up those holes essentially and a lot of people who are running vanilluxe run it with top affinis for a variety of reasons so sort of like figure out the people that are using the Pokemon you want to use what do they use with it figure out why that's the case a good resource there are a lot of analytics websites that can tell you for people that use say you would really like um column C you really like golem although I'm yeah so you'll really like a lowland golem I use pika Linux a lot although I'm not sure if that's the best analogy see analytics website I think I mean I've had I liked Pecola decks a lot Pecola Dexcom then I would just search I'm searching under the VGC 2017 for golem here it is it's only used by point zero nine percent of teams according to their analytics but on the column on the right it shows who are their common teammates so of the people that use a lowland golem 40% of them are paired with or enguru and then if you sort of look into why people are doing that you can sort of take a Pokemon that's maybe not that great but build a team around it that does fit in with them it up meta and does have some synergy with it so does that make sense at all certainly does no I would recommend we'll have you tried another lock game playthrough of the games and if so what are your impressions Nuzlocke yeah I can't no no I literally like my brie jacks I still have I don't ever know my Pokemon do are with me forever ever ever ever but I cannot do nuts lock I feel the same way uh so my answer to that would be I have done nas locks before I've never finished them because inevitably I lose a Pokemon I really like and then I get too sad to continue so I don't really exact more there there are so many different variations of nuzlockes I you can just look at our friend Maryland that dudes running a different Nuzlocke that I've never heard of every single week you ever think about how the that terminology comes from a cartoon that drew nuzleaf as the character John Locke from the television program lost is that think about how that's how we get the work yep so yeah the first thing about that all the time yes I'm what first thing I think of when I wake up it unlock the the person who popularized that type of challenge run I drew a comic of Prague of I don't know if this what this person's pronouns are so I'll just save that like I don't know so they drew a comic at to show their progress and one of their Pokemon was a nuzleaf because it was gen3 and they always drew it as a jaw like a nuzleaf with the face of Terry O'Quinn who played John Locke in TVs law ABC's lost and and then just the entire challenge itself stared beat to become known as Nuzlocke and that's just such a weird piece of history in the Pokemon fandom that always whenever I'm reminded of it I think huh lost uh alright uh I mean if I was to do it I was luck I would probably do one in the will you stop texting me your Magikarp and and text yourself I I was accidentally like test texting wrong people because I type I was typing in Steve too fast that I was texting wrong people Magikarp stuff anyways if I was to do a Nuzlocke I would do something of like if a if a Pokemon died which means you have to remove it from your team I would give it to somebody um instead of releasing it away trade it away it's an interesting like most people are doing like most nuzlockes now our twitch / YouTube related of people want to watch nuzlockes and people wanna play nuzlockes with other people watching you know if you were playing by it if you were playing by yourself you no one's gonna care / no if you're releasing or getting rid of pokemon but if you have an audience in some aspect they care as much as you care so to be so to like trade that to something peace Miss Beakman yeah so to like get rid of somebody to somebody who's also following along like that like that memory at least lives on and you're at least following the rules of okay I'm gonna have to get rid of this Pokemon but somebody else can enjoy that and have that forever that's at least what I would do that'll wrap it up for emails we have like I said we had a lot of emails a lot of really good ones we will get to those next week I just put the interview I didn't want to run that have a show run too long keep emailing in breaking breaking news incoming I just did the Magikarp adrift event went to search for my trainer and Magikarp has not found me it ended up wandering alone and lonely until night fell Magikarp is so tuckered out that is JP went down by three point nine seven K so that's kind that it's not too bad of a um okay ative it's not like a search on magic carpet drift it's not like a Kadabra comes and steals it like Pidgeotto or something at least not for me right then yeah so SP j @p k men cast calm or pokemon podcast calm that's when that's where you can shoot over your emails travis has your pokemon of the week a move set and I will give you some fun facts about it and then we will house clean up the show so it's all you the Pokemon of the week this week is Machamp Machamp hat I'm gonna give you two move sets coming from folks from our Pokemon of the week slack channel because the ability you choose on the champ is going to have a pretty large effect on what move set you are going to end up with Machamp Stu abilities are both pretty cool one of them is no guard which is one of my favorite abilities in the game just because of how interesting it is no guard has an effect where if a pokemon with no guard is out on the field all moves it uses and all moves used against it are treated as if they are like moves like Swift where they can't miss or magical leaf moves like that that have that are guaranteed to hit not even just 100% accuracy but like even if your accuracy is lower there still guaranteed to hit there's obviously a plus and a minus to that the the - is that your opponents never going to miss when attacking your Machamp the plus is that you can build a set around moves you wouldn't normally specifically form a champ the move dynamic punch which normally only has a 50% accuracy it's a fighting move with a hundred base power 50% accuracy and a 100 percent chance on hit to confuse the target but with no guard you're going to hit every time and confuse every time and deal a lot of damage the other ability is that ability that comes up I feel like a lot in Pokemon of the week which is guts guts this is an ability where your attack is going to be boosted if you are affected by a non volatile status effect so your paralysis your poison or burn and so in that case you're going to put a flame orb on there to inflict a burn on yourself so that your moves will be the power of your moves will be increased so let's go with the no guard set first this one comes to us from slack user Brandon this is Machamp with assault vest and no guard assault vest I think we've mentioned before as an item that increases your special defense if well it increases your special offense and prevents you from using moves that don't deal damage directly so your set is going to be all direct damage dealing moves the V's are going to be 252 and HP 252 and attack with your remaining 4 in defense this goes to show that you're trying to make them a champ as bulky as possible and then Brandon also recommends to team this up with Pokemon with trick room and so because of that you're going to use brave nature and put zero IVs in speed the move set is going to be dynamic punch as we mentioned because it's so great with no guard knock off just because it's one of the best moves in the game stone edge for coverage and then either bullet punch for priority or poison jab for more coverage and then Brandon recommends pairing with a porygon - or a mimic you as a user to set up trick room yep trick room is can be kind of powerful so yeah the second set slack user Steven with some assistance from select user Gabe and this is also a trick room set but this is with the ability guts using the item flame orb as I mentioned to activate that ability it's going to be 252 EVs and HP and 252 in attack with the remaining 4 in special defense and then the same way you're going to do 0 speed IVs and a brave nature with the moves protect close combat knock off and either bullet punch your poison jab so actually quite similar movesets just swapping out close combat for dynamic punch and then using protect because you're not having assault vest on this set but they function kind of differently because with the dynamic punch set you're really relying on being able to confuse a lot of things whereas with the gut set you're just trying to one at Ko as many things as possible with a very strong close combat and then the the pairing recommendation is actually the same for the first set so a porygon - or a mimic you to setup trick room there you have it Machamp if you are blessed with a shiny Machamp you're gonna get a good old Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle green instead of the I don't know blueish grey that like stone washed gray color that Machamp already is in the pokémon red and blue beta Machamp was originally known as jeux d'eau this name is accomodate corruption of Judo a fighting style the champ could be seen as a counterpart to Alakazam they are both last stage of a three part evolutionary family both were introduced in Gen 1 they will reach their final stage by trading they both have a 75% male gender ratio also al exam sells at the Special Attack step while Machamp excels at the attack set moreover the girl in our burg city will trade her Abra for a Machop who the chap can also be the counterpart to Conkeldurr or evolutionary line both of them are fighting types Pokemon who whose attack is the highest stat they both have below average speed they both share the same base stat total they have the same gender ratio they both have 3 evolutionary stages they both reach their respective final evolutionary stage through trading it's fun to know Machamp 2 is seems to be based on a bodybuilder or a wrestler let me correct you boba pedia clearly Machamp is a wrestler look at the title around its waist come on exactly but don't uh don't like bodybuilder weightlifting champions also have really big belts they win trophies mmm not not belts / titles seeing as it has more than two arms and blue skin Machamp might also be based on a Hindu god perhaps Shiva or Vishnu Vishnu Vishnu Vishnu I would say the champs a wrestler the Shiva and Vishnu connection seems like a stretch to me ah isn't cheapo like an ice goddess definitely is in final fantasy a place that lets yet know her depiction in final minutes down that path VII is the destroyer Wow he destroys the final an exact tell you that she was not Shiva isn't uh like there's so much depth there it's you can't even scratch the surface so don't even try yeah okay that's that's that's that is that is very strong westernization and sort of a generalization of a principle that is is much more deeper than then we have time to go into true um and a lot of deities in Hinduism are represented with multiple arms but that's just to show different aspects of their what they represent in a single you know it's it's a it's a what-do-you-call-it trick that you use in art that you you know it's just function it doesn't mean that they actually think of the deities as having multiple arms hmm all right I'll take your word for it let's do some housecleaning here there is some shirts stickers
