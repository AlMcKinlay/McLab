happens after this episode comes out on (1:24 - 1:31)
Monday cuz I&#39;m leaving (1:28 - 1:33)
to Madrid (1:31 - 1:35)
tomorrow and I was trying to get as much (1:33 - 1:37)
work done possible so I don&#39;t have to (1:35 - 1:39)
bring a bunch of equipment to (1:37 - 1:42)
Madrid and then deal with that so um we (1:39 - 1:44)
got an episode for you guys today we (1:42 - 1:47)
still got plenty of things to cover um (1:44 - 1:50)
and if I saw you at go Fest in Madrid it (1:47 - 1:52)
was awesome it was very nice to meet you (1:50 - 1:55)
uh I keep getting asked this question (1:52 - 1:58)
yes I am going to New York Greg is also (1:55 - 2:00)
going to New York I am going to New York (1:58 - 2:03)
Hannah is question mark to New York yeah (2:00 - 2:06)
to be determined okay it&#39;s like an anime (2:03 - 2:08)
episode to be to (2:06 - 2:12)
be find out next week if Hannah is going (2:08 - 2:13)
to New (2:12 - 2:16)
York (2:13 - 2:20)
perfect um let&#39;s uh let&#39;s just jump (2:16 - 2:22)
right into things uh and we&#39;ll start off (2:20 - 2:23)
with Pokemon (2:22 - 2:28)
sleep we know the details of Mr (2:23 - 2:32)
karant the game has (2:28 - 2:32)
updated so when this podcast comes out (2:33 - 2:39)
uh you will be able to get cramar ant I (2:36 - 2:42)
believe after 400m he starts spawning in (2:39 - 2:44)
the game local time or something like (2:42 - 2:46)
that obviously you can&#39;t get him Sunday (2:44 - 2:49)
into Monday it has to be Monday into (2:46 - 2:51)
Tuesday okay I think it&#39;s to prevent (2:49 - 2:53)
people from like taking a nap right away (2:51 - 2:55)
it would probably be after 4: (2:53 - 3:00)
a.m. maybe when the day switch is over (2:55 - 3:00)
I don&#39;t have the thing in front of me (3:01 - 3:05)
but what is the thing okay is it the (3:07 - 3:12)
official Summer Festival when does it (3:10 - 3:14)
start no not the Summer Festival it (3:12 - 3:18)
would be the karant being (3:14 - 3:19)
added (3:18 - 3:23)
um anyways uh as you guys look that up (3:19 - 3:24)
not that that matters I don&#39;t think (3:23 - 3:26)
anyone is waking up at like 8:00 a.m. on (3:24 - 3:28)
Monday morning and being like I need to (3:26 - 3:30)
take a nap (3:28 - 3:33)
because you wouldn&#39;t even have enough I (3:30 - 3:34)
don&#39;t know I guess if you were paid to (3:33 - 3:37)
win maybe you could get it up to that (3:34 - 3:41)
rank June 17th beginning at 3 p.m. 3 P.M (3:37 - 3:44)
see I&#39;m not I&#39;m not absolutely I&#39;m only (3:41 - 3:47)
slightly crazy uh no karat incense can (3:44 - 3:49)
be used starting from the date and time (3:47 - 3:53)
above which is June 17th at 3 (3:49 - 3:56)
p.m. got it I wonder what would happen (3:53 - 3:58)
if you used it before 300 (3:56 - 4:03)
p.m. and you took a nap nothing maybe (3:58 - 4:05)
you can&#39;t get it before then maybe it (4:03 - 4:06)
maybe it would oh maybe it would just (4:05 - 4:08)
like lock you out you know how you can&#39;t (4:06 - 4:12)
use yeah incense on certain Islands (4:08 - 4:13)
maybe it&#39;s like (4:12 - 4:18)
that uh okay so uh we know now we now (4:13 - 4:20)
know that (4:18 - 4:24)
karan&#39;s main skill is tasty chance small (4:20 - 4:27)
which is the same as (4:24 - 4:30)
den and it is the second and only only (4:27 - 4:32)
Pokemon to have tasty chance small as (4:30 - 4:33)
along with the den if you don&#39;t know (4:32 - 4:34)
what that (4:33 - 4:37)
does it means at base level it will give (4:34 - 4:40)
you a 4% chance of getting a critical (4:37 - 4:43)
hit on your meals and if you don&#39;t get (4:40 - 4:45)
the critical hit and you get another (4:43 - 4:47)
tasty chance small it just adds up and (4:45 - 4:49)
it will keep adding up until you get a (4:47 - 4:52)
critical hit and then of I think it (4:49 - 4:53)
gives you more than 4% on Sundays but (4:52 - 4:58)
Sundays are already a base 20 20% I (4:53 - 5:00)
think 30% I thought it was 30 I think (4:58 - 5:04)
it&#39;s base 10 and then Sunday adds 20 (5:00 - 5:06)
something like that yeah I think I think (5:04 - 5:10)
it&#39;s it it hits 30 so (5:06 - 5:14)
yeah uh does the fan do anything yet or (5:10 - 5:15)
is it just another animation I have to (5:14 - 5:18)
sit through for no good reason it goes (5:15 - 5:21)
faster now not fast (5:18 - 5:24)
enough well when they added crant glad (5:21 - 5:26)
you brought up the speed thing they also (5:24 - 5:30)
updated how fast you add ingredients to (5:26 - 5:34)
your cooking pot so that animation is (5:30 - 5:35)
way quicker I don&#39;t know if you know (5:34 - 5:38)
this but like if you just hold down on (5:35 - 5:40)
the ingredient it&#39;ll just keep adding it (5:38 - 5:43)
over and over so that animation is way (5:40 - 5:45)
way faster as of this morning I guess (5:43 - 5:48)
because that&#39;s when the update went (5:45 - 5:50)
through the there is a small difference (5:48 - 5:55)
between karant and den crar uh Den is a (5:50 - 6:00)
skill Monon so you it its skill will (5:55 - 6:02)
activate more (6:00 - 6:03)
often which (6:02 - 6:07)
is tasty chance small and then ideally (6:03 - 6:11)
you would want skill trigger main skill (6:07 - 6:13)
level up that kind of stuff karant is an (6:11 - 6:16)
ingredient mon so it means that even (6:13 - 6:18)
though its main skill is still tasty (6:16 - 6:21)
chance it probably will not proc as (6:18 - 6:24)
often as Den Den&#39;s because its focus is (6:21 - 6:27)
also ingredients so on karant you&#39;re (6:24 - 6:29)
probably looking for still skill trigger (6:27 - 6:32)
Main skill chance ingredient finder (6:29 - 6:35)
would still be really good here the only (6:32 - 6:38)
thing we don&#39;t know is one how often (6:35 - 6:40)
that main skill does Pro compared to D (6:38 - 6:42)
Den safe to assume though it&#39;s not as (6:40 - 6:44)
often as the den just based on skills (6:42 - 6:46)
versus ingredients and the other thing (6:44 - 6:48)
we don&#39;t know is what ingredients karant (6:46 - 6:50)
can get us we won&#39;t know that until (6:48 - 6:53)
somebody catches their first crar for (6:50 - 6:56)
some reason that can&#39;t be data mined (6:53 - 6:57)
even though literally everything else (6:56 - 6:58)
can (6:57 - 7:01)
be but yeah we never know ingredients (6:58 - 7:05)
until then I would assume karant would (7:01 - 7:07)
have corn since corn is like the best (7:05 - 7:09)
ingredient in the game yeah corn was my (7:07 - 7:13)
first thought maybe also (7:09 - 7:16)
milk a lot of things have milk yeah I (7:13 - 7:18)
feel too many EGS have milk maybe eggs (7:16 - 7:20)
eggs eggs eggs I can see (7:18 - 7:23)
eggs corn makes sense cuz they&#39;re in the (7:20 - 7:25)
shape of (7:23 - 7:27)
eruda I don&#39;t know that&#39;s a particularly (7:25 - 7:30)
compelling (7:27 - 7:30)
it looks like a fish I mean mushrooms (7:32 - 7:36)
fit into that (7:35 - 7:39)
too technically look more like an erota (7:36 - 7:41)
because they&#39;re colored the (7:39 - 7:44)
same I don&#39;t know what would be like I&#39;m (7:41 - 7:47)
not that deep into sleep where I&#39;m (7:44 - 7:50)
like I need I&#39;m looking for like this (7:47 - 7:52)
specific ingredient I guess I&#39;m looking (7:50 - 7:53)
for corn but that&#39;s just because corn is (7:52 - 7:56)
so new and so few Pokemon have (7:53 - 7:58)
corn but like I have a really good (7:56 - 8:00)
potato man (7:58 - 8:03)
I have a really good Mushroom Man so (8:00 - 8:04)
like when I&#39;m thinking of like oh I need (8:03 - 8:06)
those ingredients I just switched to (8:04 - 8:07)
those Pokemon I don&#39;t have a mushroom (8:06 - 8:11)
man yet yeah nether do I I think Gengar (8:07 - 8:13)
is still the best I have a Shiny Gengar (8:11 - 8:19)
and it&#39;s level 60 is mushrooms oh and I (8:13 - 8:22)
only use shinies that&#39;s my thing you&#39;re (8:19 - 8:25)
not a shiny get off my team unless (8:22 - 8:27)
you&#39;re my one Butterfree who is like (8:25 - 8:29)
super ingredient finder and I have (8:27 - 8:32)
nothing else to put in there then it and (8:29 - 8:35)
then it goes to (8:32 - 8:35)
Butterfree maybe maybe the best possible (8:36 - 8:42)
outcome for karat oh yeah I think so (8:39 - 8:45)
too I feel like (8:42 - 8:48)
oil is too dark you (8:45 - 8:52)
know you know like no as a child of the (8:48 - 8:56)
80s doing oil is just too dark for me (8:52 - 8:58)
and I&#39;m going to just reject that right (8:56 - 9:01)
now (8:58 - 9:01)
thematically though you know no no it&#39;s (9:03 - 9:10)
too dark dis dish soap and karat go hand (9:06 - 9:14)
in hand because of the Exxon (9:10 - 9:14)
Valdes look it&#39;s a (9:14 - 9:18)
possibility so milk and corn and eggs (9:19 - 9:24)
that&#39;s what we (9:22 - 9:24)
want uh take this with a grain of salt (9:25 - 9:30)
because this is from the people who look (9:27 - 9:33)
at the update and then tell us what the (9:30 - 9:36)
update says it&#39;s saying on green grass (9:33 - 9:38)
karant will start spawning at master (9:36 - 9:41)
rank one for your one star master rank (9:38 - 9:43)
five for your two star and then master (9:41 - 9:46)
rank six for your four (9:43 - 9:48)
star I don&#39;t know why three star doesn&#39;t (9:46 - 9:50)
have anything but I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s (9:48 - 9:54)
just because it probably is between five (9:50 - 9:57)
and six um because the other ones have (9:54 - 9:58)
stuff (9:57 - 10:02)
so un sure why again that&#39;s why I say (9:58 - 10:03)
take this with a grand salt if you&#39;re on (10:02 - 10:06)
the beach karat will start spawning at (10:03 - 10:07)
Ultra rank (10:06 - 10:10)
three uh and then master rank two master (10:07 - 10:13)
rank eight and four star is master rank (10:10 - 10:17)
three which again a little confusing but (10:13 - 10:21)
I guess fourstar is just a repeat of one (10:17 - 10:23)
star I everyone has noticed this right (10:21 - 10:25)
like the Pokemon that appears on the (10:23 - 10:29)
stomach is just a previous year used (10:25 - 10:32)
yeah um I feel like maybe there&#39;s one or (10:29 - 10:35)
two that are slightly different but (10:32 - 10:37)
yeah and then if you&#39;re at the tundra (10:35 - 10:39)
it&#39;s going to be M carer will start (10:37 - 10:42)
spawning at Ultra rank one Ultra rank (10:39 - 10:45)
five master rank six and then the four (10:42 - 10:48)
star would be master rank (10:45 - 10:48)
one and we&#39;ve talked about the Pokemon (10:49 - 10:55)
that spawn in what (10:52 - 10:55)
area and there will be (10:56 - 11:01)
there there are (11:00 - 11:06)
boxes that I think the middle box for (11:01 - 11:09)
12200 gems will get you a Karan incense (11:06 - 11:10)
and then it looks like you can earn a (11:09 - 11:13)
crar incense through event missions and (11:10 - 11:17)
then we know the (11:13 - 11:21)
cromatic as Hannah said last week gets (11:17 - 11:24)
more and more (11:21 - 11:24)
expensive noticeably so I don&#39;t really (11:26 - 11:34)
understand the point of the crar (11:30 - 11:34)
adic Oh I thought Hannah was about to (11:36 - 11:39)
explain (11:38 - 11:42)
it we&#39;re both seeing who was going to (11:39 - 11:45)
explain if you have too many candy of a (11:42 - 11:47)
Pokemon you are never going to use candy (11:45 - 11:50)
on you can use the cromatic to condense (11:47 - 11:53)
it into a type candy that is most likely (11:50 - 11:56)
going to be for the type that you use to (11:53 - 11:58)
make (11:56 - 12:01)
it so if you you have I mean I get the (11:58 - 12:04)
theory behind it I don&#39;t see the point (12:01 - 12:06)
of it I don&#39;t but then you can use that (12:04 - 12:08)
candy on a different Pokemon that you (12:06 - 12:11)
actually will use do you know how many (12:08 - 12:13)
like candies I have just sitting in that (12:11 - 12:16)
thing because I always get (12:13 - 12:21)
srank here&#39;s here here&#39;s what I have (12:16 - 12:23)
throw candy at a Pokemon when of my (12:21 - 12:28)
shinies to like make bag space all the (12:23 - 12:30)
time I burn through (12:28 - 12:32)
through a (12:30 - 12:36)
large six medium and 46 small rare (12:32 - 12:39)
candies a large is 100 rare candies on (12:36 - 12:40)
just (12:39 - 12:43)
Dratini if you would like to waste your (12:40 - 12:46)
candy as fast as possible Larvitar and (12:43 - 12:49)
Dratini will especially if they have exp (12:46 - 12:52)
down nature yes both my Larvitar and (12:49 - 12:55)
Dratini have exp down so because pseudo (12:52 - 12:57)
legendaries in this game are still the (12:55 - 12:59)
hardest to power well pseudo legendaries (12:57 - 13:01)
and legendaries (12:59 - 13:05)
um I was really hoping to unlock corn (13:01 - 13:10)
before next week on my dragon air I&#39;m (13:05 - 13:12)
out of rare candy and I&#39;m at level 27 of (13:10 - 13:14)
30 oh (13:12 - 13:17)
no so well before next week it&#39;s only (13:14 - 13:20)
Tuesday as of recording if you keep it (13:17 - 13:23)
in your party and just check the game (13:20 - 13:26)
frequently enough yes you may be able to (13:23 - 13:28)
get to level (13:26 - 13:31)
29 but not 30 you&#39;ll never get cor I (13:28 - 13:33)
also will be putting Altaria on my team (13:31 - 13:36)
every night because it has the (13:33 - 13:41)
XP um Pokemon XP bonus every night so (13:36 - 13:43)
it&#39;ll add a little bit every (13:41 - 13:46)
morning um yeah the cromatic is going to (13:43 - 13:49)
get more expensive every time you use (13:46 - 13:52)
it uh it looks like the first time you (13:49 - 13:54)
use it is about a th000 dream shards the (13:52 - 13:56)
second time you use it is 5,000 third (13:54 - 14:01)
time is 15,000 and fourth time is 40,000 (13:56 - 14:02)
um per (14:01 - 14:06)
something but it it&#39;s increases per day (14:02 - 14:08)
so I think a if if you are free to play (14:06 - 14:10)
or if you&#39;re a casual person you should (14:08 - 14:13)
use it once a day every day if you&#39;re a (14:10 - 14:15)
little bit more hardcore you could (14:13 - 14:17)
probably get away with using it twice a (14:15 - 14:22)
day every day but don&#39;t wait till like (14:17 - 14:24)
Saturday and be like a I didn&#39;t use it (14:22 - 14:25)
all week I&#39;m going to use it four times (14:24 - 14:28)
because it&#39;s just going to clean you out (14:25 - 14:30)
of dream shards (14:28 - 14:32)
so I don&#39;t know anyone who would be (14:30 - 14:35)
using it four times a day every day (14:32 - 14:38)
besides just whales yeah someone&#39;s going (14:35 - 14:42)
to but it&#39;s going to take up a (14:38 - 14:47)
lot yeah it seems very (14:42 - 14:47)
expensive (14:48 - 14:51)
um I&#39;m I&#39;m curious on a on a different (14:51 - 14:57)
level why they (14:55 - 15:01)
limit the in incense (14:57 - 15:03)
purchases like the medium one is (15:01 - 15:06)
1,200 you get the Karan incense I don&#39;t (15:03 - 15:07)
know what else you (15:06 - 15:11)
get but they only let you buy (15:07 - 15:17)
one it is kind of weird to be like what (15:11 - 15:19)
if you just want more karant spawns cuz (15:17 - 15:22)
they&#39;re still hard to catch like I (15:19 - 15:24)
remember getting the den and since that (15:22 - 15:26)
first time and using both of them and (15:24 - 15:28)
neither time did Denny was hungry yeah (15:26 - 15:31)
neither time crit it wasn&#39;t until the (15:28 - 15:33)
third time D Den showed up naturally I (15:31 - 15:35)
was able to catch (15:33 - 15:38)
it (15:35 - 15:38)
so to cater towards (15:38 - 15:44)
Wales you would think like why what&#39;s (15:41 - 15:46)
what&#39;s the problem with them spending (15:44 - 15:48)
another $20 for another crar an because (15:46 - 15:51)
I think 12 I think 1,200 gems is 20 (15:48 - 15:53)
bucks yeah (15:51 - 15:56)
I I don&#39;t understand in general why they (15:53 - 15:58)
do false scarcity and a lot of these (15:56 - 16:00)
things but they do they also don&#39;t make (15:58 - 16:03)
it possible to purchase the master ball (16:00 - 16:07)
yeah so there there&#39;s just some level of (16:03 - 16:11)
challenge there is maybe what it&#39;s for (16:07 - 16:14)
for I guess I don&#39;t know I I don&#39;t have (16:11 - 16:15)
enough (16:14 - 16:19)
dream uh points to get a master ball for (16:15 - 16:21)
a karant I&#39;m not actually expecting to (16:19 - 16:24)
get a karant this time around oh you (16:21 - 16:26)
don&#39;t have like 4,000 points you&#39;re (16:24 - 16:28)
saying nope I figured there was nothing (16:26 - 16:29)
I needed a master ball for anymore I (16:28 - 16:31)
have a (16:29 - 16:33)
d surprise I think I still have two (16:31 - 16:34)
master (16:33 - 16:37)
balls Master biscuits I should say I (16:34 - 16:40)
have one in my inventory and then I have (16:37 - 16:44)
like 8,000 points so I could buy another (16:40 - 16:46)
one (16:44 - 16:48)
which I don&#39;t know I gu I I guess that&#39;s (16:46 - 16:51)
my plan right is (16:48 - 16:51)
like I could I could probably get to (16:51 - 16:55)
ultra rank yeah I could probably get to (16:53 - 16:58)
ultra rank three in the first night on (16:55 - 17:00)
beach cuz I&#39;ve it before and I&#39;ll be (16:58 - 17:03)
using good camp ticket (17:00 - 17:03)
but it would be use the first incense (17:05 - 17:12)
that night spawn the crar ant masterball (17:09 - 17:14)
it if it&#39;s not hungry get the second (17:12 - 17:18)
incense spawn it catch it and then hope (17:14 - 17:21)
the rest of the week that more spawn in (17:18 - 17:22)
I (17:21 - 17:25)
guess (17:22 - 17:29)
yep that&#39;s the best chance you&#39;ve got (17:25 - 17:31)
not that any of us have ever cheated in (17:29 - 17:33)
Pokemon sleep nor have our listeners (17:31 - 17:34)
cheated in Pokemon sleep but slumbering (17:33 - 17:36)
is the easiest to (17:34 - 17:41)
get like you can force slumbering MH (17:36 - 17:44)
slumbering is the one you can slumbering (17:41 - 17:48)
is one you can force right you just put (17:44 - 17:51)
it on your bedside table and you&#39;re like (17:48 - 17:54)
guaranteed slumbering that&#39;s it (17:51 - 17:57)
yeah more (17:54 - 18:00)
hacks the hot sleeve tip not that I (17:57 - 18:03)
would ever condone cheating in Pokemon (18:00 - 18:06)
sleep they&#39;re being so nice to you (18:03 - 18:08)
though with the crar an being the best (18:06 - 18:09)
Pokemon it could (18:08 - 18:12)
be yeah yeah yeah yeah knowing my luck (18:09 - 18:14)
is I&#39;ll get like it will have a good (18:12 - 18:16)
ingredient like corn and the my crer (18:14 - 18:18)
will be like all eggs or (18:16 - 18:22)
something yep that&#39;s the (18:18 - 18:22)
plan (18:24 - 18:31)
uh okay in other in other Pokemon (18:26 - 18:31)
news oh sorry before we get to there was (18:32 - 18:38)
a small update to Heracross and Pinsir (18:34 - 18:40)
um very very minor update I think each (18:38 - 18:44)
one can now hold three extra items I (18:40 - 18:45)
think pincer is three and herac Crosses (18:44 - 18:49)
4 and then I believe their main skill (18:45 - 18:52)
has gotten a small activation boost for (18:49 - 18:54)
both of (18:52 - 18:58)
them don&#39;t think that like changes (18:54 - 18:59)
anything (18:58 - 19:01)
too (18:59 - 19:05)
much yeah but uh both of those Pokemon (19:01 - 19:09)
got a minor buff looks like was plus (19:05 - 19:12)
three and Heracross was plus two oh okay (19:09 - 19:13)
okay (19:12 - 19:17)

you click into the the sarab (20:52 - 20:59)
be page not on the front page (20:55 - 21:01)
on their Universal Studios to page oh (20:59 - 21:03)

website it&#39;s a Gyarados whirling (21:06 - 21:11)
smoothie it has a soda and pineapple (21:09 - 21:13)
flavor and I think it looks really good (21:11 - 21:15)
it&#39;s bright blue with pineapple in it (21:13 - 21:20)
that does sound awesome right sound (21:15 - 21:21)
good (21:20 - 21:24)
um oh and there&#39;s the the normal drink (21:21 - 21:28)
they have is a Bulbasaur melon soda (21:24 - 21:30)
that&#39;s also so good melon soda is such a (21:28 - 21:34)
good flavor these both sound (21:30 - 21:34)
amazing you&#39;re not a me you&#39;re not a (21:37 - 21:44)
melon fan most okay watermelon (21:39 - 21:49)
yes but most melon drinks aren&#39;t (21:44 - 21:54)
watermelon they are honeydew or um (21:49 - 21:57)
cantaloupe or musky melony flavored I&#39;m (21:54 - 22:00)
not a fan of those type some melons to (21:57 - 22:02)
be honest I&#39;ll eat them but I&#39;m not a (22:00 - 22:04)
huge fan of them melon soda in Japan (22:02 - 22:08)
which is usually bright green um doesn&#39;t (22:04 - 22:10)
taste like any of those I think I think (22:08 - 22:13)
it doesn&#39;t really taste like a melon it (22:10 - 22:15)
just tastes sugary and amazing yeah it&#39;s (22:13 - 22:16)
very sugary I actually think it&#39;s a (22:15 - 22:19)
little too as somebody who lives off (22:16 - 22:21)
sugar I think it&#39;s a little sugary for (22:19 - 22:23)
me like I love it but I can never finish (22:21 - 22:25)
the (22:23 - 22:27)
can interestes you can get the melon (22:25 - 22:30)
soda in the the vending machines there I (22:27 - 22:34)
think I&#39;ve only had it at karaoke in (22:30 - 22:34)
Japan it is a great drink for keeping (22:35 - 22:39)
your voice (22:37 - 22:42)
going uh good to know uh okay let&#39;s take (22:39 - 22:44)
a quick break and then when we come back (22:42 - 22:47)
we got some more Pokemon news so we will (22:44 - 22:51)
be right back and we are back from our (22:47 - 22:55)
break uh again cuz we&#39;re recording this (22:51 - 22:57)
podcast in the future and then it&#39;s (22:55 - 23:00)
coming out uh Electric type embor would (22:57 - 23:01)
have (23:00 - 23:05)
happened at least the first week uh and (23:01 - 23:07)
I would be in a different country so I (23:05 - 23:08)
wouldn&#39;t have been able to help people (23:07 - 23:11)
on Twitch like I normally do but by the (23:08 - 23:12)
time this podcast goes up there should (23:11 - 23:14)
be raid counters so at least if you&#39;re (23:12 - 23:16)
watching this on YouTube there&#39;ll be a (23:14 - 23:18)
little button that appears somewhere at (23:16 - 23:20)
the top that&#39;ll say raid counters I will (23:18 - 23:23)
help people the second week when I&#39;m (23:20 - 23:27)
back um I I think at one point in the (23:23 - 23:29)
podcast or maybe it was on Twitch I was (23:27 - 23:31)
like Electro uh embor would be the (23:29 - 23:33)
electric type because of wild charge (23:31 - 23:35)
because wild charge works with its (23:33 - 23:38)
ability with its hidden ability of (23:35 - 23:42)
Reckless and wild bores wild charge I (23:38 - 23:43)
don&#39;t (23:42 - 23:47)
know seven wild (23:43 - 23:47)
bores (23:47 - 23:53)
yes uh but it&#39;s still it it&#39;s still fire (23:49 - 23:55)
still (23:53 - 23:58)
fighting I don&#39;t know what the as of (23:55 - 23:59)
this recording I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know what (23:58 - 24:00)
the final move set would be but I would (23:59 - 24:03)
be very I I would be so I would be very (24:00 - 24:05)
shocked if they opted for Thunder Punch (24:03 - 24:07)
over wild charge but those are the two (24:05 - 24:09)
electric moves it gets Thunder Punch and (24:07 - 24:10)
wild charge and wild charge works with (24:09 - 24:12)
its ability (24:10 - 24:15)
yeah (24:12 - 24:18)
so um but if you&#39;ll need help I&#39;ll (24:15 - 24:23)
be doing help on Twitch the second week (24:18 - 24:24)
and hopefully the raid counters I put (24:23 - 24:29)
out cover all the bases um embor gets a (24:24 - 24:30)
lot of different moves but it doesn&#39;t (24:29 - 24:33)
get like a lot of like status type moves (24:30 - 24:35)
um compared to like other Pokemon like (24:33 - 24:37)
it doesn&#39;t get sword stance or anything (24:35 - 24:38)
it gets bulk up but gets bulk up doesn&#39;t (24:37 - 24:42)
it it gets bulk up and curse yeah okay (24:38 - 24:44)
which ultimately are the same move (24:42 - 24:46)
except curse has a downside bulk up (24:44 - 24:48)
doesn&#39;t so I don&#39;t know yeah it&#39;s gon to (24:46 - 24:49)
be bulk (24:48 - 24:51)
up if it was anything it&#39;d be bulk up (24:49 - 24:53)
what was the last Pokemon oh Swamper (24:51 - 24:54)
yeah they didn&#39;t give Swamper anything (24:53 - 24:56)
they give it yawn that was actually (24:54 - 24:59)
really surprising like the attacks it (24:56 - 25:01)
got was not surprising like it had (24:59 - 25:04)
hydropump it had sludge wave it had (25:01 - 25:06)
muddy water none of that was surprising (25:04 - 25:09)
giving it yawn was just (25:06 - 25:12)
like (25:09 - 25:12)
okay I mean yeah it gets (25:12 - 25:19)
it sure did sure did does it does embor (25:15 - 25:25)
get any level up willowwisp oh (25:19 - 25:28)
okay gets does it get that by level up (25:25 - 25:30)
or does it get that by by TM I get to (25:28 - 25:32)
that by (25:30 - 25:34)
TM doesn&#39;t get a lot of status type (25:32 - 25:36)
moves by level (25:34 - 25:40)
up uh it gets he crash obviously uh but (25:36 - 25:43)
he crash doesn&#39;t work with (25:40 - 25:43)
Reckless that doesn&#39;t mean like there (25:43 - 25:48)
are only three moves embor gets that (25:46 - 25:53)
work with Reckless which is head (25:48 - 25:57)
smash um wild charge and then flare bits (25:53 - 26:00)
flare bits (25:57 - 26:00)
take (26:00 - 26:05)
down oh yeah uh it get taked down and (26:02 - 26:08)
double edge but double edge would be (26:05 - 26:08)
stronger and then head smash is like 150 (26:08 - 26:14)
it&#39;s like crazy crazy strong uh but I (26:11 - 26:17)
don&#39;t actually expect it to get (26:14 - 26:19)
that (26:17 - 26:21)
because I think it isn&#39;t it a two- turn (26:19 - 26:24)
move doesn&#39;t it have to like charge and (26:21 - 26:26)
then do it yes and then it can still (26:24 - 26:29)
miss it&#39;s like 80% accurate it&#39;s like is (26:26 - 26:30)
actually kind of like (26:29 - 26:35)
bad uh yeah H Mash is 80% (26:30 - 26:39)
accurate does it get what is that (26:35 - 26:41)
one fighting (26:39 - 26:43)
move it gets Hammer arm it gets CL (26:41 - 26:46)
combat it gets brick break it gets all (26:43 - 26:47)
the standard gets rain punch I think I&#39;m (26:46 - 26:49)
thinking of hammer arm which I don&#39;t (26:47 - 26:50)
really remember what Hammer arm does (26:49 - 26:55)
Hammer arm lowers your speed (26:50 - 26:55)
mhm and then it also gets like (26:56 - 27:00)
earthquake it get it gets it gets really (26:59 - 27:04)
good coverage um it gets scalded I think (27:00 - 27:05)
scald is probably the most surprising (27:04 - 27:09)
move that it gets uh a fire type Pokemon (27:05 - 27:11)
getting water (27:09 - 27:14)
coverage no no one no one start typing (27:11 - 27:17)
the comments Vol Canon yes (27:14 - 27:19)
sure it&#39;s a water and fire type I (27:17 - 27:23)
understand but most fire type starters (27:19 - 27:25)
don&#39;t get a water typee move but (27:23 - 27:26)
obviously thematically the water type (27:25 - 27:29)
move that burns you yeah (27:26 - 27:31)
I still don&#39;t know why pyge doesn&#39;t get (27:29 - 27:33)
Scaled that still makes me (27:31 - 27:38)
mad yeah yeah and they gave it (27:33 - 27:42)
to what&#39;s the one what&#39;s the gets it (27:38 - 27:45)
yeah C gets it yeah but btig iist (27:42 - 27:47)
doesn&#39;t (27:45 - 27:51)
how it&#39;s right there it&#39;s hot (27:47 - 27:53)
tea poor crar doesn&#39;t get it either but (27:51 - 27:56)
I think that would hurt his (27:53 - 27:56)
throat you got to protect protect (27:56 - 27:59)
protect the throat at all cost protect (27:58 - 28:02)
the throat at all costs uh Pokemon (27:59 - 28:03)

of the best pairs in this entire game is (29:22 - 29:29)
Karina and marshadow it (29:26 - 29:32)
it is incredible across the board this (29:29 - 29:34)
is like if you don&#39;t have it I would (29:32 - 29:37)
strongly suggest trying to pull for it (29:34 - 29:40)
uh it&#39;s it they gave marshadow the (29:37 - 29:43)
ability to steal the powerups from (29:40 - 29:47)
opposing Pokemon so it gets you through (29:43 - 29:49)
a lot of things where they spend a bunch (29:47 - 29:51)
of time powering up and you just steal (29:49 - 29:53)
it it&#39;s a really really really great SN (29:51 - 29:59)
pair um the Verizion and uh Thundurus (29:53 - 30:03)
the Sharon and Bianca are still running (29:59 - 30:05)

pair that&#39;s (30:07 - 30:15)
coming cannot wait Mir be and Luda (30:09 - 30:15)
Colo not that actual most exciting pair (30:15 - 30:19)

ignore me every time I suggest it (30:19 - 30:27)
uh the the they have teased the greatest (30:23 - 30:32)
gym leader of all time will finally be (30:27 - 30:32)

greatest gym leader oh (30:34 - 30:38)
Larry (30:37 - 30:41)
like (30:38 - 30:43)
yeah they have so that is what I&#39;m (30:41 - 30:47)
saving my gems for right now they showed (30:43 - 30:49)
the silhouette that could only be one (30:47 - 30:51)
person got that (30:49 - 30:54)
Larry and I want is it did they show the (30:51 - 30:59)
Pokemon is it Flamingo no uh (30:54 - 31:01)
they didn&#39;t they just showed his (30:59 - 31:04)
silhouette um a lot of people are (31:01 - 31:09)
speculating uh which one it is um I have (31:04 - 31:13)
my guess as to which one it (31:09 - 31:13)
is are you just leaving it there you&#39;re (31:15 - 31:19)
not going to give us to the guess it&#39;s (31:17 - 31:23)
my favorite it&#39;s theun SPS oh dun spars (31:19 - 31:26)
yeah we don&#39;t really have a lot of great (31:23 - 31:29)
normal in the game as it is (31:26 - 31:31)
um there&#39;s not a lot of great normal (31:29 - 31:35)
pairs uh not that normal does a lot but (31:31 - 31:37)
uh well I guess we should clarify which (31:35 - 31:40)
Larry it is is it Larry showing up for (31:37 - 31:42)
his gym leader Duty or is it Larry (31:40 - 31:44)
showing up for his Elite 4 Duty well wa (31:42 - 31:46)
don&#39;t know until the story starts we (31:44 - 31:48)
have both gym leaders and Elite Four in (31:46 - 31:50)
the game right now so we have no clue (31:48 - 31:52)
but it&#39;s probably gym leader Larry so (31:50 - 31:55)
that wouldn&#39;t be flamigo right (31:52 - 31:58)
because right because it would be normal (31:55 - 32:00)
it would be (31:58 - 32:00)
normal Larry&#39;s so cool Larry is the (32:01 - 32:08)
greatest uh we still haven&#39;t heard like (32:04 - 32:12)
to be fair I will say that Larry is bait (32:08 - 32:14)
because the anniversary is coming up I (32:12 - 32:18)
don&#39;t care that Larry is bait Larry is (32:14 - 32:21)
is the thing that I want I will yeah I (32:18 - 32:22)
mean if you want it then it&#39;s not bait (32:21 - 32:25)
it&#39;s not bait because I want it uh but I (32:22 - 32:27)
will say if if you are looking for pair (32:25 - 32:30)
right now do try to get Karina and (32:27 - 32:33)
marshadow like it is it it&#39;s not as (32:30 - 32:36)
broken as Ash is but it&#39;s up there it&#39;s (32:33 - 32:39)
up there it&#39;s up (32:36 - 32:41)
there do you think the anniversary is (32:39 - 32:43)
bringing back (32:41 - 32:43)
Ash like that is like the most in demand (32:43 - 32:50)
unit at this point it is um it&#39;s (32:46 - 32:54)
possible they&#39;re bringing a back a lot (32:50 - 32:57)
from 2022 and I think that&#39;s when Ash (32:54 - 32:59)
hit (32:57 - 33:03)
mhm um so it&#39;s possible it&#39;s weird (32:59 - 33:06)
because Ash is just (33:03 - 33:11)
not in the General Media right now like (33:06 - 33:13)
nobody&#39;s talking about as like there&#39;s (33:11 - 33:16)
not a lot of reason for (33:13 - 33:19)
the anniversary to bring back (33:16 - 33:21)
Ash (33:19 - 33:26)
um I don&#39;t see that I I feel like ash is (33:21 - 33:28)
going to come back when they have them (33:26 - 33:31)
reintroduced in the anime in the future (33:28 - 33:34)
or at least referenced in the anime and (33:31 - 33:37)
referenc in the anime um (33:34 - 33:41)
CU Ash was yeah Ash was 2022 and they (33:37 - 33:44)
are bringing back a lot from 2022 it&#39;s (33:41 - 33:46)
possible I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s very (33:44 - 33:50)
likely um just because there&#39;s no reason (33:46 - 33:52)
there&#39;s nothing talking about Ash right (33:50 - 33:55)
now there&#39;s no anime there&#39;s no game (33:52 - 33:58)
there&#39;s no there&#39;s no nothing that is (33:55 - 34:02)
Ash Centric uh this would be the thing (33:58 - 34:04)
talking about Ash though yeah they could (34:02 - 34:07)
it is it is a unit that needs to come (34:04 - 34:12)
back uh because it&#39;s Ash (34:07 - 34:16)
is oddly incredibly strong like just (34:12 - 34:18)
like there&#39;s no good reason other than (34:16 - 34:20)
it&#39;s ash from the anime and you he can&#39;t (34:18 - 34:24)
that is a good reason yeah but it is one (34:20 - 34:28)
of the strongest uh that that they put (34:24 - 34:30)
out and they&#39;ve just not brought it back (34:28 - 34:32)
um so they could they&#39;re doing a lot (34:30 - 34:33)
from (34:32 - 34:35)
2022 (34:33 - 34:38)
uh so we&#39;ll see I have a feeling though (34:35 - 34:42)
the anniversary is going to focus a lot (34:38 - 34:44)
around uh I have a feeling it&#39;s going to (34:42 - 34:46)
be a new Volo we have been building the (34:44 - 34:50)
story up to Volo becoming something more (34:46 - 34:53)
important uh and the storyline has (34:50 - 34:55)
bolo&#39;s been playing weak that&#39;s why he (34:53 - 34:58)
only has a Togepi so we I expect that to (34:55 - 35:01)
be Volo with (34:58 - 35:04)
probably the other form of Gant (35:01 - 35:08)
gutina against what Cynthia has so I (35:04 - 35:11)
think syia has the original form and (35:08 - 35:13)
he&#39;d get the worm form yeah that is sort (35:11 - 35:14)
of my feeling everyone what&#39;s going to (35:13 - 35:17)
happen around the second Ann (35:14 - 35:21)
Fe get yeah (35:17 - 35:21)
ah I feel like that&#39;s where we&#39;re (35:22 - 35:27)
leading to uh with the mystery Stone (35:24 - 35:28)
we&#39;ve already had the first first (35:27 - 35:31)
storyline showdown between Cynthia and (35:28 - 35:34)
Volo um they&#39;ve already met and stared (35:31 - 35:36)
daggers at each (35:34 - 35:39)
other I really need to play this game (35:36 - 35:42)
yeah although I don&#39;t disagree I have a (35:39 - 35:47)
problem with this General theme of this (35:42 - 35:49)
game where everybody knows these people (35:47 - 35:51)
are dangerous criminals but they&#39;re like (35:49 - 35:53)
but we really can&#39;t do anything about it (35:51 - 35:55)
so we&#39;re just going to keep our eye on (35:53 - 35:57)
you and I&#39;m like I don&#39;t think that&#39;s (35:55 - 36:01)
how that should work like you know you (35:57 - 36:04)
know Cyrus wants to blow up the universe (36:01 - 36:05)
and the only thing keeping him Al line (36:04 - 36:09)
is Sophocles like make this make sense (36:05 - 36:12)
to me these are known wanted criminals (36:09 - 36:14)
and you&#39;re all like we know that but (36:12 - 36:16)
maybe you&#39;ll (36:14 - 36:19)
change no (36:16 - 36:22)
no uh Greg I would like a Pokemon unite (36:19 - 36:26)
update uh from my from my knowledge (36:22 - 36:29)
watching NAIC this this past weekend uh (36:26 - 36:32)
I was both excited and disappointed at (36:29 - 36:36)
the same time because while no one was (36:32 - 36:38)
playing karant which was the (36:36 - 36:40)
disappointment karant kept being (36:38 - 36:42)
people&#39;s ban (36:40 - 36:45)
Choice which is why no one could play it (36:42 - 36:47)
yeah so it seems like crar very good and (36:45 - 36:49)
people did not want to play against it (36:47 - 36:51)
because it kept getting banned yeah (36:49 - 36:54)
crr&#39;s in a good spot (36:51 - 36:58)
again um (36:54 - 36:58)
yeah unite is in a weird spot I I as I I (36:58 - 37:04)
took I was saying with I took a break uh (37:01 - 37:08)
the draft thing is not fun with randoms (37:04 - 37:10)
it&#39;s just it&#39;s definitely fun to watch (37:08 - 37:12)
in tournament settings though it&#39;s great (37:10 - 37:14)
if you have a five person and you can (37:12 - 37:16)
talk about it it is not great with (37:14 - 37:20)
randoms so the new season has started uh (37:16 - 37:21)
wait wait wait hold on how does it work (37:20 - 37:24)
with randoms because you&#39;re not talking (37:21 - 37:27)
you&#39;re not talking somebody two people (37:24 - 37:31)
are chosen to pick the ban on each side (37:27 - 37:33)
and you can yeah randomly and you can (37:31 - 37:37)
make suggestions as to what you (37:33 - 37:39)
everybody thinks you say I suggest you (37:37 - 37:43)
ban this it is up to them what they have (37:39 - 37:46)
decided to banned and there some in-game (37:43 - 37:48)
communication (37:46 - 37:48)
though the tiniest you can put up a (37:48 - 37:53)
picture saying I wish you would ban (37:51 - 37:56)
Blastoise okay and so the are you saying (37:53 - 37:58)
that the random people in charge are (37:56 - 38:00)
picking are they are they picking things (37:58 - 38:02)
that should be banned or are they just (38:00 - 38:05)
being like I I I have a vendetta (38:02 - 38:07)
against mostly I have a (38:05 - 38:10)
vendetta uh it&#39;s mostly I don&#39;t like (38:07 - 38:13)
playing against this so I&#39;m going to ban (38:10 - 38:15)
it um some of the choices just don&#39;t (38:13 - 38:19)
make sense also it&#39;s very confusing as (38:15 - 38:23)
who&#39;s making the choices so often the (38:19 - 38:24)
person that&#39;s supposed to make the (38:23 - 38:28)
choice just doesn&#39;t and so nothing gets (38:24 - 38:30)
and then everybody gets a weird penalty (38:28 - 38:32)
because the team didn&#39;t do something and (38:30 - 38:36)
you&#39;re like this is just chaos just pure (38:32 - 38:38)
but you&#39;re chaos playing with master (38:36 - 38:41)
rank people right (38:38 - 38:43)
yeah (38:41 - 38:46)
sure yeah I mean you are they played (38:43 - 38:48)
enough games to get the master rank they (38:46 - 38:49)
played enough games to get to master (38:48 - 38:51)
rank the other problem with the way it (38:49 - 38:52)
is is that you never know when you&#39;re (38:51 - 38:55)
getting a draft match CU it&#39;s random (38:52 - 38:56)
when you get thrown into a draft match (38:55 - 38:58)
it is not all the time when you&#39;re at (38:56 - 39:00)
Master Level it&#39;s you could have normal (38:58 - 39:02)
match normal match normal and suddenly (39:00 - 39:05)
be in a draft match and be like okay I (39:02 - 39:07)
have no idea what&#39;s going on I was not (39:05 - 39:11)
prepared for this I I hope I can choose (39:07 - 39:13)
they pick the bands that I think are (39:11 - 39:15)
appropriate um and then you&#39;re also (39:13 - 39:18)
running into randoms (39:15 - 39:18)
who often don&#39;t have alternates so like (39:18 - 39:23)
the thing that they want to play either (39:22 - 39:26)
gets chosen or banned and so they are (39:23 - 39:27)
just they just randomly pick something (39:26 - 39:30)
and don&#39;t know how to play it it&#39;s super (39:27 - 39:33)
frustrating so they&#39;re moving it back to (39:30 - 39:36)
1400 it was dropped down to 1200 and (39:33 - 39:38)
there&#39;s just too many people who (39:36 - 39:41)
don&#39;t know what they&#39;re just it is not a (39:38 - 39:44)
great level it&#39;s just too chaotic it (39:41 - 39:46)
almost feels like there should be two (39:44 - 39:48)
this probably won&#39;t work but it feels (39:46 - 39:49)
like there should be two competitive (39:48 - 39:52)
cues there should be I I want to draft (39:49 - 39:56)
queue or I just want a normal game queue (39:52 - 39:57)
that would solve a lot of the issues (39:56 - 39:59)
would there be enough people for both of (39:57 - 40:02)
those I don&#39;t think there is I don&#39;t (39:59 - 40:04)
think there is at that level I just (40:02 - 40:06)
don&#39;t think so this season they are (40:04 - 40:09)
putting it back to (40:06 - 40:09)
1400 the bad thing is EX Pokemon are (40:09 - 40:16)
back in you can have one they&#39;re allowed (40:13 - 40:19)
again so that just makes this season a (40:16 - 40:20)
little bit more (40:19 - 40:23)
frustrating (40:20 - 40:23)
um karand is in a good spot suru ledge (40:23 - 40:29)
is going to be here on the 13th uh it (40:26 - 40:31)
looks very fun right now it looks a (40:29 - 40:35)
little too weak on the test server but (40:31 - 40:38)
that is every time they have something (40:35 - 40:40)
it always is too weak on the test server (40:38 - 40:42)
and then it gets launched over those (40:40 - 40:45)
numbers up before they ship it yeah they (40:42 - 40:49)
Crank It Up um ah the what was what was (40:45 - 40:52)
the question I had for you uh I guess (40:49 - 40:54)
this is more of a question for people in (40:52 - 40:56)
our Discord or slack or if you&#39;re (40:54 - 40:58)
watching on YouTube feel free to like (40:56 - 40:59)
comment how did they do it in League of (40:58 - 41:01)
Legends because League of Legends has (40:59 - 41:03)
draft and League of Legends also has (41:01 - 41:05)
like 7 million characters you can pick (41:03 - 41:07)
from where like Pokemon unite is at what (41:05 - 41:13)
like 72 73 no we&#39;re at 60 oh we&#39;re still (41:07 - 41:16)
in the 60s I think we&#39;re at just at 60 (41:13 - 41:19)
or just below like (41:16 - 41:19)
zachian brought us (41:20 - 41:24)
to (41:22 - 41:26)
49 I think and then we&#39;ve had yeah I (41:24 - 41:28)
think we&#39;re in the 50 (41:26 - 41:31)
like does does League of Legends or Dota (41:28 - 41:32)
or I don&#39;t know what the (41:31 - 41:35)
other Heroes of the Storm do people (41:32 - 41:38)
still play that um I guess that maybe (41:35 - 41:40)
works because people have microphones (41:38 - 41:41)
but I don&#39;t know what the difference of (41:40 - 41:45)
somebody being like hey you ban the (41:41 - 41:47)
fairy that floats on the book I don&#39;t (41:45 - 41:49)
know anyone in League of Legends versus (41:47 - 41:51)
like you Greg holding up a picture of (41:49 - 41:55)
like com yeah yeah I feel like there (41:51 - 41:58)
should be some sort of voting (41:55 - 42:02)
yeah there probably should be um also (41:58 - 42:04)
the other thing is like League of (42:02 - 42:05)
Legends matches can go on for an (42:04 - 42:08)
incredibly long time and unite matches (42:05 - 42:10)
are 10 minutes 45 minutes yeah the 45 (42:08 - 42:11)
minutes I&#39;ve seen one that lasted two (42:10 - 42:14)
hours I&#39;m like what&#39;s going on somebody (42:11 - 42:15)
do (42:14 - 42:17)
something um yeah I don&#39;t know how it (42:15 - 42:19)
works with other ones I think they have (42:17 - 42:20)
I I think unite could use a separate (42:19 - 42:24)
queue I think they could make a ranked (42:20 - 42:27)
that is all draft from lowlevel all the (42:24 - 42:31)
way up for people to play in um I think (42:27 - 42:32)
that would be a better solution than (42:31 - 42:34)
sort of what we have now which is (42:32 - 42:36)
randomly at master rank at whatever (42:34 - 42:37)
level you get (42:36 - 42:40)
to uh I know a lot of people were very (42:37 - 42:43)
are just not happy with the way that the (42:40 - 42:44)
draft is and they&#39;re very happy that (42:43 - 42:46)
it&#39;s going back to (42:44 - 42:48)
1400 (42:46 - 42:51)
um we also haven&#39;t had a lot of Pokemon (42:48 - 42:54)
added I mean suru ledge it took a while (42:51 - 42:58)
to get here um so there some concern (42:54 - 43:00)
that they are slowing down well what (42:58 - 43:01)
what were the like the last four Pokemon (43:00 - 43:04)
are what ceru Edge failinks failinks (43:01 - 43:08)
Gyarados gidos uh maridon and (43:04 - 43:10)
maridon I mean that&#39;s a lot I feel like (43:08 - 43:11)
that&#39;s a lot of Pokemon since Pokemon (43:10 - 43:14)
day because maridon was Pokemon (43:11 - 43:17)
day we used to get one every month that (43:14 - 43:20)
was Pokemon day we Gyarados was before (43:17 - 43:22)
Pokemon day so it went Mar on on Pokemon (43:20 - 43:25)
day (43:22 - 43:25)
failinks okay so that&#39;s about three and (43:25 - 43:30)
four months yeah it&#39;s it they were (43:28 - 43:32)
coming out at a much steadier clip and (43:30 - 43:34)
they&#39;ve slowed down which I is both good (43:32 - 43:36)
and bad I guess it it&#39;s (43:34 - 43:39)
it we just need a new map that&#39;ll fix (43:36 - 43:41)
everything yeah I (43:39 - 43:44)
mean there are rumors as to what the (43:41 - 43:47)
next EX Pokemon is supposed to be wait (43:44 - 43:50)
where are the rumors uh the rumors are (43:47 - 43:51)
that hoo is (43:50 - 43:55)
coming as a not as the center Pokemon as (43:51 - 43:58)
a playable play as a playable Defender (43:55 - 44:00)
that is the rumor Defender ex defend (43:58 - 44:02)
with rainbows cuz they&#39;re they got (44:00 - 44:03)
they&#39;re running out of days got nothing (44:02 - 44:06)
but rainbows and they call in (44:03 - 44:11)
Lugia um that is the rumor we just (44:06 - 44:12)
things have been kind of quiet on the (44:11 - 44:16)
Pokemon leveling front so we&#39;re just (44:12 - 44:20)
like okay like generally by the (44:16 - 44:23)
time sured was announced we would have (44:20 - 44:25)
heard at least what the next thing was (44:23 - 44:27)
and we don&#39;t even have that we just we (44:25 - 44:30)
don&#39;t have anything yeah um but unit&#39;s (44:27 - 44:32)
anniversary is end of July yeah the (44:30 - 44:34)
anniversary is coming up so something (44:32 - 44:36)
big should be coming it is probably (44:34 - 44:40)
another ex it is quite possibly (44:36 - 44:44)
hoo um which will be overpowered and (44:40 - 44:47)
will make the game unplayable for for a (44:44 - 44:49)
few months because everybody will play (44:47 - 44:50)
it and it&#39;s (44:49 - 44:56)
op um but I think (44:50 - 44:56)
I think as far as balance-wise all (44:57 - 45:04)
everything is well balanced right now um (45:00 - 45:06)
even I mean you just sort of have to (45:04 - 45:08)
suffer with with a person you know a (45:06 - 45:10)
team that picks three three EXs like (45:08 - 45:12)
they&#39;re back in play you&#39;re just going (45:10 - 45:16)
to have to deal with it um I think it is (45:12 - 45:20)
probably best for drafts to stay at 1400 (45:16 - 45:21)
because I think it&#39;s just too (45:20 - 45:25)
frustrating at the lower levels yeah I&#39;m (45:21 - 45:26)
wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this year (45:25 - 45:28)
especially for the anniversary trying to (45:26 - 45:30)
think of like what would be good for (45:28 - 45:31)
anniversary you know what they haven&#39;t (45:30 - 45:32)
done (45:31 - 45:37)
yet Vaporeon uh Flareon jolon they have (45:32 - 45:38)
not done the (45:37 - 45:41)
originals they and and if there&#39;s if (45:38 - 45:43)
there&#39;s if there&#39;s a type of Pokemon (45:41 - 45:46)
that brings people to a game it is the (45:43 - 45:48)
Eevee (45:46 - 45:50)
Pokemon and they have not done those (45:48 - 45:52)
three yet so you have you you have you (45:50 - 45:55)
have the Eevee Fanboys and you also (45:52 - 45:57)
apply you also appeal to the Gen one (45:55 - 46:01)
people as well with with those Eevees we (45:57 - 46:05)
also only have one of the pan (46:01 - 46:08)
starters the other two (46:05 - 46:09)
are (46:08 - 46:13)
true unknown we have we have we don&#39;t (46:09 - 46:14)
have a lot of the starters too like (46:13 - 46:17)
there&#39;s a a lot of the generations don&#39;t (46:14 - 46:19)
have starters in that game yeah you know (46:17 - 46:21)
what I think what would fix unite would (46:19 - 46:23)
be (46:21 - 46:26)
incinerar I think he would be a a good (46:23 - 46:29)
addition (46:26 - 46:29)
we would see how people would react to (46:30 - 46:36)
that I feel like Eevee they may be (46:33 - 46:39)
leaning into Eevee day being a thing so (46:36 - 46:41)
I could see those happening in November (46:39 - 46:44)
oh yeah I forgot about Evie day yeah (46:41 - 46:47)
Eevee day they may bring them into Eevee (46:44 - 46:49)
day (46:47 - 46:52)
um but yeah there Pokemon that missed (46:49 - 46:54)
Eevee day where they announced it but it (46:52 - 46:56)
didn&#39;t come out until afterwards uh (46:54 - 47:00)
umbre I think was didn&#39;t come out until (46:56 - 47:02)
after uh yeah even like the Leaguers (47:00 - 47:04)
don&#39;t have anything about new Pokemon (47:02 - 47:06)
coming out like the last thing is suru (47:04 - 47:09)
Edge uh and again it comes out on the (47:06 - 47:13)
13th it will only be gems at first it&#39;s (47:09 - 47:15)
the same thing it&#39;s gems for the first (47:13 - 47:16)
week and then you can buy it with coins (47:15 - 47:18)
after so you&#39;ll be able to get it for (47:16 - 47:22)
coins on the 20th Pokemon&#39;s in a good (47:18 - 47:24)
spot with (47:22 - 47:27)
leaks I you you kind of I I I think you (47:24 - 47:29)
know not to not to go back to Pokémon (47:27 - 47:31)
day but when if we were to go back to (47:29 - 47:34)
Pokemon day which was 4 months ago 3 (47:31 - 47:39)
months ago you know it was let let&#39;s go (47:34 - 47:42)
Whooper let&#39;s go giraff rig let&#39;s go (47:39 - 47:44)
Crobat you know it was gen two stuff and (47:42 - 47:47)
it was a bunch of Gen 5 stuff (47:44 - 47:51)
and all of those leakers were wrong (47:47 - 47:53)
right every single one was wrong and we (47:51 - 47:58)
have gotten no information about (47:53 - 48:01)
Za we don&#39;t know what&#39;s coming in unite (47:58 - 48:03)
we don&#39;t know what&#39;s coming in (48:01 - 48:04)
Masters (48:03 - 48:07)
we don&#39;t even (48:04 - 48:10)
know I&#39;m trying to think like we we (48:07 - 48:11)
don&#39;t know what the Pokemon would be (48:10 - 48:14)
before suun and Pokemon sleep the only (48:11 - 48:15)
reason we know suun is coming is because (48:14 - 48:17)
they told us all three legendary beasts (48:15 - 48:19)
are (48:17 - 48:23)
coming like it&#39;s I don&#39;t want to say the (48:19 - 48:25)
Pokemon company has figured out their (48:23 - 48:28)
leaking problem (48:25 - 48:30)
but there we don&#39;t actually know what&#39;s (48:28 - 48:32)
coming this year at (48:30 - 48:35)
all I mean one of the things about unite (48:32 - 48:36)
is stuff has to go on the public test (48:35 - 48:38)
server that&#39;s where most of the leaks (48:36 - 48:42)
come from yeah because they&#39;re public (48:38 - 48:43)
and nothing&#39;s nothing&#39;s happening on the (48:42 - 48:45)
public test server other than Sur ledge (48:43 - 48:48)
so it I think people in general a little (48:45 - 48:51)
like uneasy as about what&#39;s happening I (48:48 - 48:54)
think mainly because one the cause of (48:51 - 48:57)
iny we know the anniversary is coming up (48:54 - 48:59)
we know what a nightmare it was when (48:57 - 49:02)
Mewtwo was released without being tested (48:59 - 49:04)
it was just bad and I think people are (49:02 - 49:07)
concerned that they&#39;re going to drop (49:04 - 49:10)
another untested EX on the anniversary (49:07 - 49:13)
and it&#39;s going to be frustrating and (49:10 - 49:15)
that is a very valid thing that happens (49:13 - 49:19)
in unite it has happened multiple times (49:15 - 49:22)
uh I get sort of the secrecy about it (49:19 - 49:25)
but also please let us test this and (49:22 - 49:27)
give you feedback before it&#39;s live in (49:25 - 49:30)
game and making everybody miserable yeah (49:27 - 49:32)
given the nature of the game a surprise (49:30 - 49:35)
like that is maybe not as good as it is (49:32 - 49:39)
in the other games yeah uh Mewtwo was (49:35 - 49:43)
awful um and then dasian was also awful (49:39 - 49:45)
they didn&#39;t relase it maridon was less (49:43 - 49:47)
bad but it was on the test server so (49:45 - 49:51)
people knew it was going on um and so (49:47 - 49:53)
there was like a Pokemon they added it (49:51 - 49:55)
was like around the time of like mamos (49:53 - 49:56)
swine it wasn&#39;t Mamoswine because (49:55 - 49:59)
Mamoswine was completely underpowered (49:56 - 50:02)
where they did emergency maintenance and (49:59 - 50:03)
they fixed it within like a day or two (50:02 - 50:06)
of it being out Sylveon they did that (50:03 - 50:09)
with uh syon was (50:06 - 50:11)
cranked Beyond and some of they not do (50:09 - 50:14)
emergency maintenance for Mewtwo zashi (50:11 - 50:17)
and maridon (50:14 - 50:20)
they did not do emergency maintenance (50:17 - 50:23)
for Mewtwo it took two weeks before they (50:20 - 50:27)
nerfed it they did do a mergency (50:23 - 50:31)
maintenance on zashin because there was (50:27 - 50:34)
a code error that it was doing 100% (50:31 - 50:36)
ignoring of Defense which it shouldn&#39;t (50:34 - 50:38)
have been doing oh uh but they didn&#39;t (50:36 - 50:42)
Nerf it and then they did an emergency (50:38 - 50:44)
Nerf (50:42 - 50:45)
on (50:44 - 50:49)
maridon I think three days after it came (50:45 - 50:53)
out um but took a long after s started (50:49 - 50:55)
to dwindle (50:53 - 50:59)
yeah yeah that&#39;s how it (50:55 - 51:02)
works sir we&#39;ve sold as many maridons as (50:59 - 51:04)
possible everybody else is doing the (51:02 - 51:07)
free version so crank it down all right (51:04 - 51:09)
all right give him the (51:07 - 51:13)
Nerf um I do think like I do think (51:09 - 51:16)
everything is well balanced so far uh (51:13 - 51:18)
you know everything&#39;s been out for a (51:16 - 51:20)
while uh that&#39;s also one of the plus (51:18 - 51:22)
sides of not getting any new Pokemon for (51:20 - 51:24)
a bit like everything sort of settles (51:22 - 51:25)
down and everybody sort of knows how to (51:24 - 51:27)
play so it&#39;s not terrible that we (51:25 - 51:30)
haven&#39;t gotten a new one yeah um and I (51:27 - 51:33)
think suru Edge looks like a lot of fun (51:30 - 51:35)
like it really moves well on the screen (51:33 - 51:37)
it looks like a ton of fun I am probably (51:35 - 51:40)
actually going to buy it I just wish it (51:37 - 51:43)
wasn&#39;t yet another allrounder we have a (51:40 - 51:48)
lot of all-rounders we we don&#39;t need (51:43 - 51:53)
more we need new map we need a new map (51:48 - 51:56)
we don&#39;t have a lot of supporters either (51:53 - 51:59)
like we&#39;re really quarter (51:56 - 51:59)
light like can we can we balance these (52:00 - 52:07)
out a little bit um and we don&#39;t have a (52:04 - 52:11)
lot of Defenders but I guess (52:07 - 52:13)
like what are you going to (52:11 - 52:16)
do everybody wants to play the (52:13 - 52:19)
attackers yeah people people love (52:16 - 52:21)
hitting people love how people work yep (52:19 - 52:27)
just in in Final Fantasy and Destiny and (52:21 - 52:30)
Violet people just love being the damage (52:27 - 52:33)
we up to3 (52:30 - 52:37)
Pokemon 63 (52:33 - 52:37)
63 hopefully Pokemon number 64 soon is (52:37 - 52:43)
Bellsprout that&#39;s just his pokeddex (52:44 - 52:47)
number (52:46 - 52:49)
that&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s a joke in there (52:47 - 52:52)
somewhere I&#39;ll let you guys figure it (52:49 - 52:54)
out all right let&#39;s take a quick break (52:52 - 52:56)
and then when we come back we&#39;re going (52:54 - 52:58)

like some I don&#39;t know if it was like a (54:28 - 54:34)
marching band or what but they had (54:31 - 54:36)
trumpets and drums and it was very it (54:34 - 54:39)
was very like my only experience with (54:36 - 54:41)
with Narin is like the Migra stuff that (54:39 - 54:45)

Migra they had a whole parade at the (54:45 - 54:50)
opening that&#39;s amazing all (54:47 - 54:52)

June I think this is just the right way (55:41 - 55:50)
to do that kind of thing as much as it (55:44 - 55:51)
sucks (55:50 - 55:54)
just like if your appointment&#39;s at 3 (55:51 - 55:56)
then you&#39;re just not waiting in line all (55:54 - 55:58)
day yeah it means that there aren&#39;t (55:56 - 56:00)
people waiting in line the entire time (55:58 - 56:02)
who never get to get (56:00 - 56:05)
in because that&#39;s what you really don&#39;t (56:02 - 56:07)
want right you don&#39;t want to like spend (56:05 - 56:10)
all this money to go to a world (56:07 - 56:11)
championship and then be like well on (56:10 - 56:13)
Friday I spent it I was all day in line (56:11 - 56:15)
and they ran out of backpack so I&#39;m (56:13 - 56:17)
going back on Saturday to try again (56:15 - 56:19)
because they said maybe new backpacks (56:17 - 56:22)

no one likes waiting in (56:22 - 56:24)
lines uh (56:25 - 56:30)
one person that really likes (56:28 - 56:32)
waiting the one person addicted to (56:30 - 56:34)
Street (56:32 - 56:34)
pass I guess I can I can also officially (56:35 - 56:41)
announce that the Pokemon company did (56:38 - 56:45)
invite me to Hawaii uh as an official (56:41 - 56:46)
Pokemon (56:45 - 56:49)
partner what that really means is they (56:46 - 56:50)
are paying for my flight and they&#39;re (56:49 - 56:52)
paying for my hotel this is what they (56:50 - 56:53)
did (56:52 - 56:57)
for um last year well August last year (56:53 - 57:00)
they only paid for my hotel but to be (56:57 - 57:02)
fair I was already coming for other (57:00 - 57:05)
related things (57:02 - 57:08)
so uh I I always want to be completely (57:05 - 57:10)
as transparent as possible on this (57:08 - 57:13)
podcast uh so they did invite me to (57:10 - 57:17)
London as well um and they I just said (57:13 - 57:20)
they invited me to Yama when they invite (57:17 - 57:22)
when they invited me to those two things (57:20 - 57:24)
there was no requirement on my end (57:22 - 57:27)
besides the standard FTC disclosure of (57:24 - 57:30)
hey this company paid for this part but (57:27 - 57:33)
I I was not required to make a YouTube (57:30 - 57:37)
video tweet about it say good things I (57:33 - 57:38)
literally think on this podcast last (57:37 - 57:40)
year we talked about how two Japanese (57:38 - 57:43)
dudes fought got in a fist fight over a (57:40 - 57:45)
skateboard I mean if anything they (57:43 - 57:46)
probably wouldn&#39;t have wanted me to talk (57:45 - 57:48)
about that but there was there was like (57:46 - 57:49)
no (57:48 - 57:53)
obligations um there was a a contract I (57:49 - 57:56)
had to sign this year uh and that (57:53 - 57:59)
contract states that I get free Hotel I (57:56 - 58:01)
get free flight and I also owe them (57:59 - 58:02)
three Twitter (58:01 - 58:05)
posts ironic it&#39;s not called Twitter (58:02 - 58:07)
anymore um yeah it I owe them two (58:05 - 58:10)
Instagram posts I owe them one live (58:07 - 58:12)
stream and then I owe them one YouTube (58:10 - 58:14)
video which they said the YouTube video (58:12 - 58:16)
can just be an archive of the live (58:14 - 58:19)
stream so obviously we&#39;ve been talking (58:16 - 58:21)
about worlds we&#39;re talking about worlds (58:19 - 58:24)
right now I&#39;m not obligated to lay out (58:21 - 58:26)
the what is happening at Worlds like (58:24 - 58:28)
this is not a sponsor this podcast (58:26 - 58:31)
itself is not sponsored the stuff that (58:28 - 58:34)
the Pokemon does that Pokemon rle (58:31 - 58:36)
require me for worlds will be clearly (58:34 - 58:39)
labeled of the with the hashtag poemon (58:36 - 58:42)
partner on whatever social media (58:39 - 58:46)
platform that is I think that even if (58:42 - 58:47)
you&#39;re not going to (58:46 - 58:50)
Worlds or if I wasn&#39;t going to Worlds it (58:47 - 58:53)
would still be a normal part of the show (58:50 - 58:56)
to cover worlds since over the last (58:53 - 58:59)
couple years they have really gone above (58:56 - 59:01)
and beyond to make this like a (58:59 - 59:04)
celebration of Pokemon regardless if you (59:01 - 59:08)
care about TCG finals right like you can (59:04 - 59:10)
go to like when when you went to London (59:08 - 59:11)
or when you went to Yokohama or even (59:10 - 59:13)
when they started doing this back in DC (59:11 - 59:17)
before covid they were adding so many (59:13 - 59:19)
things of like picture opportunities (59:17 - 59:21)
play this demo early do this Pokemon go (59:19 - 59:24)
thing on top of that we have exclusive (59:21 - 59:28)
spawns I think at DC if I&#39;m not if I&#39;m (59:24 - 59:29)
remembering correctly you could like (59:28 - 59:31)
watch detective Pikachu right like they (59:29 - 59:33)
had a whole movie theater for that none (59:31 - 59:35)
of us in our group did but they did have (59:33 - 59:36)
a whole movie theater for (59:35 - 59:40)
it we didn&#39;t do that but you could have (59:36 - 59:43)
but we could (59:40 - 59:43)
have I remember for Yokohama the one (59:43 - 59:48)
thing I skipped (59:46 - 59:52)
was um path to the peak they did the (59:48 - 59:53)
premiere for that where you could watch (59:52 - 59:56)
it early and I remember the Pokemon rep (59:53 - 59:58)
being like you&#39;re skipping this and I (59:56 - 60:00)
was like I&#39;m going to be (59:58 - 60:02)
honest I can watch this on my couch at (60:00 - 60:05)
home like I just don&#39;t want to lose like (60:02 - 60:08)
two hours of Japan time to something (60:05 - 60:11)
that is like they took me to a tea (60:08 - 60:12)
ceremony right they took me to all these (60:11 - 60:14)
other things like I cannot do that on my (60:12 - 60:17)
couch at home I can definitely watch (60:14 - 60:19)
your Pokemon YouTube (60:17 - 60:23)
video the couch at (60:19 - 60:23)
home uh so they they did um okay so with (60:24 - 60:32)
that like disclosure out of the way uh (60:28 - 60:34)
they did put up a (60:32 - 60:39)
schedule of what&#39;s Happening which now I (60:34 - 60:41)
don&#39;t know where that schedule (60:39 - 60:41)
went um download schedule here it is so (60:42 - 60:49)
uh Friday August 16th the opening (60:46 - 60:52)
ceremony will be 900 (60:49 - 60:56)
a.m. Hawaii time which what is how does (60:52 - 60:58)
time zones work in Hawaii it&#39;s not like (60:56 - 61:01)
an hour behind California it&#39;s like (60:58 - 61:04)
three hours I think yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s (61:01 - 61:06)
in the middle of the (61:04 - 61:10)
ocean it is it&#39;s closer to Japan than (61:06 - 61:11)
people (61:10 - 61:15)
think yes three hours before West Coast (61:11 - 61:17)
time five hours before y (61:15 - 61:20)
time if Opening Ceremonies is 9 a.m. (61:17 - 61:24)
Hawaii time and it&#39;s 9:00 am and that (61:20 - 61:28)
would be 6:00 a.m. California (61:24 - 61:28)
no no you&#39;re going the wrong way oh I&#39;m (61:29 - 61:34)
going the wrong (61:32 - 61:37)
way if it&#39;s 9:00 a.m. in Hawaii it would (61:34 - 61:39)
be noon in California noon in California (61:37 - 61:42)
yeah got it okay so this event should (61:39 - 61:44)
actually be really easy for people to (61:42 - 61:47)
watch which was kind of the opposite of (61:44 - 61:49)
Japan (61:47 - 61:53)
MH which I think like when the finals (61:49 - 61:55)
happened it was like 6:00 a.m. or (61:53 - 61:59)
something that sounds about right (61:55 - 62:03)
yeah uh time zones are (61:59 - 62:05)
tough there are a lot of them hard to (62:03 - 62:09)
keep track sometimes uh opening ceremony (62:05 - 62:11)
will be 9:00 a.m Hawaii time and then (62:09 - 62:13)
literally everything is going to start (62:11 - 62:17)
unite go TCG and (62:13 - 62:20)
VGC will all (62:17 - 62:24)
start and then on (62:20 - 62:24)
Sunday you will oh actually on Saturday (62:24 - 62:30)
you will have the Sim single elimination (62:27 - 62:32)
unite (62:30 - 62:35)

will be at (63:13 - 63:18)
5:30 Hawaii (63:15 - 63:23)
time so if you&#39;re watching on Twitch or (63:18 - 63:26)
YouTube should be pretty watchable for (63:23 - 63:27)
everyone in the United States which is (63:26 - 63:29)
the majority of people who listen to (63:27 - 63:31)
this (63:29 - 63:31)
podcast I don&#39;t make me do time zones (63:31 - 63:36)
for Japan at this point I don&#39;t they&#39;re (63:34 - 63:37)
they&#39;re in their own world there are (63:36 - 63:41)
converters you can do online (63:37 - 63:41)
yes uh and then they said there will be (63:42 - 63:46)
a bunch of activities from Thursday to (63:44 - 63:48)
Sunday with no pre-registration they (63:46 - 63:50)
have not listed what those activities (63:48 - 63:53)
are they did show the Pikachu plush they (63:50 - 63:55)
also showed the little card um which is (63:53 - 63:58)
the the champion card it&#39;s the same (63:55 - 64:01)
champion card as last year the the card (63:58 - 64:03)
itself does the same thing the art is (64:01 - 64:06)
different um golden Go is is featured on (64:03 - 64:08)
the (64:06 - 64:12)
art uh I think the card is like any (64:08 - 64:15)
sidey duck in play has one less of a (64:12 - 64:17)
retreat (64:15 - 64:17)
cost that that&#39;s that&#39;s what it does (64:18 - 64:24)
that&#39;s what it did last year (64:21 - 64:24)
that&#39;s yeah yep that&#39;s what it looks (64:24 - 64:30)
like I (64:27 - 64:30)
think uh yeah they they switched it yeah (64:32 - 64:39)
I think last year was called I think (64:37 - 64:41)
it&#39;s called Paradise Resort yes it I (64:39 - 64:44)
think is what the card it&#39;s called um (64:41 - 64:46)
yeah the retreat cost of Psyduck in play (64:44 - 64:48)
both yours and your opponents one one (64:46 - 64:49)
star left so if you don&#39;t know like the (64:48 - 64:51)
history of like the world championship (64:49 - 64:54)
cards they&#39;re always they almost always (64:51 - 64:55)
there&#39;s probably like an exception to (64:54 - 64:58)
this there are almost always Stadium (64:55 - 65:00)
cards and so Stadium cards can be played (64:58 - 65:03)
for both people whether you participate (65:00 - 65:07)
in go or unite or VGC um you get one of (65:03 - 65:09)
these cards as like a competitor and (65:07 - 65:11)
then there are cards that will say like (65:09 - 65:16)
top 32 top 16 um like Champion you get a (65:11 - 65:18)
different card also when you&#39;re Champion (65:16 - 65:19)
you get like a card that says you&#39;re (65:18 - 65:22)
Champion which is really cool regardless (65:19 - 65:24)
of again regardless if you win VGC or (65:22 - 65:26)
TCG you get the champion card (65:24 - 65:29)
and then there&#39;s also staff versions of (65:26 - 65:32)
these world of these Stadium cards that (65:29 - 65:35)
go out because if you volent from what I (65:32 - 65:39)
was told this is new information to me (65:35 - 65:43)
that they do now pay their staff I&#39;ve (65:39 - 65:46)
been told that they pay them $20 an (65:43 - 65:49)
hour and that they get like a food stien (65:46 - 65:52)
no sorry it&#39;s not $20 an hour it&#39;s $100 (65:49 - 65:54)
a (65:52 - 65:56)
day which I think they&#39;re scheduled 8 (65:54 - 65:58)
hour (65:56 - 66:02)
days so a little less than $20 an hour (65:58 - 66:05)
yeah so you you get $100 a day you get (66:02 - 66:07)
your Pokemon cards or whatever because (66:05 - 66:09)
they give people booster boxes and then (66:07 - 66:11)
you get your food stien as (66:09 - 66:15)
well so that&#39;s cool back in geez like 10 (66:11 - 66:16)
years ago when I was playing (66:15 - 66:18)
competitively if you wanted to be a (66:16 - 66:20)
judge (66:18 - 66:24)
or any staff that helped uh it was (66:20 - 66:27)
here&#39;s three booster Bo boxes of Noble (66:24 - 66:31)
Victors purely volunteer yeah yeah so it (66:27 - 66:32)
it sounds like they&#39;re paying people (66:31 - 66:34)
which is very (66:32 - 66:37)
cool I think I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s like (66:34 - 66:39)
quickly signing up to be like ah great (66:37 - 66:40)
pay I think people genuinely want to (66:39 - 66:42)
help out and want to be judges and stuff (66:40 - 66:43)
but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s great that they&#39;re (66:42 - 66:45)
getting paid (66:43 - 66:48)
for um it sounds like some of the other (66:45 - 66:51)
activities include photo ops and meet (66:48 - 66:55)
and greets is what they&#39;re saying so who (66:51 - 66:56)
knows how much (66:55 - 67:00)
that is anything more than just a big (66:56 - 67:02)
inflatable (67:00 - 67:06)
Pikachu that&#39;s a great photo op yeah (67:02 - 67:07)
well meet and greets would probably be (67:06 - 67:11)
with Pikachu Eevee the starters yeah (67:07 - 67:15)
probably massuda they have quite often (67:11 - 67:17)
done meet and greets with massuda which (67:15 - 67:19)
is not really a meet and greet it is go (67:17 - 67:21)
up there say say (67:19 - 67:23)
Konichiwa had the it&#39;s meet and greet (67:21 - 67:25)
with with massuda translator is what it (67:23 - 67:27)
is the signature it&#39;s getting a (67:25 - 67:29)
signature on something right yeah I mean (67:27 - 67:31)
that is the definition of meeting (67:29 - 67:33)
somebody and greeting them it&#39;s true (67:31 - 67:39)
it&#39;s very true um I don&#39;t know they they (67:33 - 67:42)
have not told me anything of what they (67:39 - 67:45)
want content creators to do this is the (67:42 - 67:46)
first year that they put content (67:45 - 67:48)
creators on their website which is kind (67:46 - 67:50)
of crazy so if you go to the website and (67:48 - 67:52)
you click special guests you can see the (67:50 - 67:56)
people they&#39;ve invited um anyone that (67:52 - 67:58)
Pokemon partner they have probably the (67:56 - 68:00)
same requirements as me they were Pro (67:58 - 68:02)
they got their flight and their hotel (68:00 - 68:05)
paid for they probably have different (68:02 - 68:07)
things right like I&#39;m a streamer so my (68:05 - 68:10)
contract involved do a live stream but I (68:07 - 68:14)
also have a backpack that can do a live (68:10 - 68:17)
stream yeah so I&#39;m sure these other (68:14 - 68:20)
people on the list have different (68:17 - 68:22)
requirements (68:20 - 68:25)
um and then there&#39;s there there are a (68:22 - 68:26)
bunch of content creators I got free (68:25 - 68:29)
passes but they did not get the flight (68:26 - 68:32)
and hotel covered uh and again I never (68:29 - 68:34)
say this to Breg I say this because (68:32 - 68:37)
legally I have to disclose that (68:34 - 68:40)
that&#39;s companies are paying for (68:37 - 68:42)
things uh you do have to register for a (68:40 - 68:45)
spectator (68:42 - 68:50)
badge the the venue does have uh support (68:45 - 68:54)
for um accessibility and dis (68:50 - 68:56)
disability there&#39;s still the normal code (68:54 - 68:57)
of (68:56 - 68:58)
contuct (68:57 - 69:02)
um I this is on the big island of Hawaii (68:58 - 69:05)
right y this is the the big but not the (69:02 - 69:09)
capital uh I mean so it&#39;s not Big Island (69:05 - 69:11)
yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s not oh it&#39;s not the big (69:09 - 69:13)
island it&#39;s not Big Island I don&#39;t know (69:11 - 69:15)
how Hawaii works I don&#39;t know the names (69:13 - 69:17)
of all the different (69:15 - 69:20)
Islands it is I like what what is the (69:17 - 69:22)
touristy Island that people normally go (69:20 - 69:25)
to for Hawaii (69:22 - 69:25)
um depends on what you want so if you (69:27 - 69:31)
want to go see the volcano and do the (69:30 - 69:33)
volcano stuff that&#39;s big island because (69:31 - 69:35)
big island has the active volcano on it (69:33 - 69:39)
okay I see I see Honolulu notu is on the (69:35 - 69:42)
small a a smaller Island it&#39;s the second (69:39 - 69:46)
island I think it&#39;s on aahu yeah I think (69:42 - 69:48)
it&#39;s on H it&#39;s on hu but I forget if (69:46 - 69:50)
that&#39;s the second or the (69:48 - 69:52)
third I saw a Tik Tok where there&#39;s an (69:50 - 69:57)
island where no one can go to yes (69:52 - 69:57)
uh yeah it&#39;s so it&#39;s like big island and (69:58 - 70:03)
then aaho is across so is Big Island (70:01 - 70:05)
where the volcano is the big island (70:03 - 70:08)
where the volcano is so I don&#39;t think (70:05 - 70:09)
Pokemon company is going to have me walk (70:08 - 70:12)
up a volcano no okay (70:09 - 70:16)
good uh also big island is quickly (70:12 - 70:19)
becoming not the housing of the volcano (70:16 - 70:21)
because as always it&#39;s moving and the (70:19 - 70:23)
new island is already forming so if you (70:21 - 70:24)
go to the big island you can see where (70:23 - 70:27)
the new island will be (70:24 - 70:29)
I love (70:27 - 70:32)
construction yep it&#39;s fiery fiery fiery (70:29 - 70:34)
construction uh yeah so you&#39;ll be on (70:32 - 70:39)
aahu which is where Honolulu is (70:34 - 70:41)
um you can get to all of the other (70:39 - 70:43)
Islands if you really want they have (70:41 - 70:48)
planes and boats but it&#39;s expensive (70:43 - 70:48)
and if you don&#39;t have a reason to if you (70:48 - 70:53)
don&#39;t have a place to stay on Big Island (70:51 - 70:55)
like don&#39;t go there like there&#39;s not a (70:53 - 70:57)
lot to see if you&#39;re not going to spend (70:55 - 70:59)
time (70:57 - 71:02)
there and Maui is where the fires (70:59 - 71:04)
happened which is a different Island (71:02 - 71:06)
then big island (71:04 - 71:11)
and H where Hulu is (71:06 - 71:11)
yes so Maui (71:11 - 71:15)
is I think in between aahu and Big (71:16 - 71:23)
Island I&#39;m going to need (71:20 - 71:26)
like cheat cheats or little note cards (71:23 - 71:29)
to remember these also technically the (71:26 - 71:32)
fires also happened on Big Island (71:29 - 71:34)
because there was a huge eruption not (71:32 - 71:37)
that long ago the volcano did it is an (71:34 - 71:41)
active volcano it goes off uh and blocks (71:37 - 71:43)
off huge swaths of that (71:41 - 71:45)
Island (71:43 - 71:50)
um and it&#39;s quickly uh (71:45 - 71:52)
like Hawaii needs to sort of decide what (71:50 - 71:54)
they&#39;re doing because all the islands (71:52 - 71:56)
are slowly sinking into the (71:54 - 71:59)
into back into the ocean as the volcano (71:56 - 72:02)
makes new ones the old ones go down and (71:59 - 72:03)
then get eroded away because they&#39;re (72:02 - 72:08)
Island um but yeah Honolulu is on aahu (72:03 - 72:10)
Maui which is where the fires are are (72:08 - 72:12)
sort of in the middle and then big (72:10 - 72:15)
island is where the volcano (72:12 - 72:15)
is and you can kind of see all of them (72:16 - 72:22)
from certain Vantage points on all the (72:19 - 72:24)
islands we did do that when I was in (72:22 - 72:25)
Hawaii we did go to the places where you (72:24 - 72:27)
can kind of see where the other islands (72:25 - 72:29)
are as when was the last time you were (72:27 - 72:32)
in Hawaii Greg we went there for our (72:29 - 72:34)
anniversary I mean for our for our (72:32 - 72:38)
wedding honeymoon so it was (72:34 - 72:38)
2015 oh quite a while ago yeah it&#39;s (72:39 - 72:43)
quite a while (72:41 - 72:47)
ago it&#39;s really expensive yeah I know (72:43 - 72:50)
there will goes almost every year but (72:47 - 72:56)
that&#39;s cuz his M it we live yeah and (72:50 - 72:59)
that&#39;s why that&#39;s why him and his mom go (72:56 - 73:01)
off yearly oh pretty yearly I mean I (72:59 - 73:03)
don&#39;t think it&#39;s yearly anymore because (73:01 - 73:04)
that stopped for Co so I think it&#39;s (73:03 - 73:08)
every other year now but they do (73:04 - 73:11)
go yeah I think will well will lived in (73:08 - 73:13)
Hawaii for what like four or five years (73:11 - 73:17)
yeah as a kid yeah (73:13 - 73:17)
yeah um but I think he&#39;s been to all the (73:17 - 73:22)
islands except the island you&#39;re not (73:21 - 73:24)
allowed to go to (73:22 - 73:27)
yes correct cuz no one can go to that (73:24 - 73:29)
Hawaii that Island (73:27 - 73:34)
correct get sinking into the ocean I had (73:29 - 73:37)
a I had a bit of dilemma with this (73:34 - 73:40)
cuz there there is the there is the (73:37 - 73:43)
debate of like Hawaii suffers from (73:40 - 73:45)
tourism uh over tourism and then there&#39;s (73:43 - 73:47)
the like Hawaii needs tourism and I&#39;ve (73:45 - 73:50)
I&#39;ve I&#39;ve spoken to both people right (73:47 - 73:53)
and even when I was in Japan uh two of (73:50 - 73:55)
my two of my friends who live out there (73:53 - 73:57)
they&#39;re from Hawaii they lived in Hawaii (73:55 - 74:00)
for 20 some years and they&#39;ve been in (73:57 - 74:02)
Japan for like the last three and they (74:00 - 74:04)
were super excited about this and they (74:02 - 74:06)
they were one of the people that were (74:04 - 74:08)
like no Hawaii does need the tourism (74:06 - 74:11)
like that&#39;s how it funds everything and (74:08 - 74:13)
they&#39;re going back obviously for worlds (74:11 - 74:15)
and stuff so I I what I&#39;m saying is I (74:13 - 74:17)
can see both sides I can see like Hawaii (74:15 - 74:19)
needs the tourism and I can see like (74:17 - 74:21)
Hawaii&#39;s overrun with tourism and when (74:19 - 74:22)
Pokemon asked (74:21 - 74:25)
me if I wanted to go and that they were (74:22 - 74:29)
going to offer to pay there (74:25 - 74:33)
was I I guess when it came down to it I (74:29 - 74:35)
thought if I said no because I didn&#39;t (74:33 - 74:38)
want to be part of the problem (74:35 - 74:41)
that they would just ask somebody else (74:38 - 74:43)
and that person could be part of the (74:41 - 74:45)
problem and when I when I say like part (74:43 - 74:47)
of the problem I think like if you I (74:45 - 74:49)
don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with (74:47 - 74:52)
going to Hawaii if or like any country (74:49 - 74:54)
if you are respectful and you&#39;re proper (74:52 - 74:57)
tourist like you can see tons of videos (74:54 - 75:00)
of people being outrageous in Japan or (74:57 - 75:02)
kot like the Kyoto in Japan or like any (75:00 - 75:05)
other City Italy (75:02 - 75:08)
France Spain I&#39;m naming countries not (75:05 - 75:11)
cities um but (75:08 - 75:13)
like when I was thinking about it I was (75:11 - 75:15)
looking (75:13 - 75:23)
up native Hawaiian businesses mhm and so (75:15 - 75:23)
like what drove me crazy in (75:23 - 75:28)
Japan I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m like jumping back (75:26 - 75:30)
and forth I promise my my point will (75:28 - 75:33)
make some sense what drove me absolutely (75:30 - 75:36)
crazy in Japan is in shabuya (75:33 - 75:39)
Crossing they&#39;re that&#39;s where everyone (75:36 - 75:40)
like pulls out their phone because (75:39 - 75:43)
they&#39;re like a shabuya Crossing but next (75:40 - 75:45)
to shabuya Crossing there is this huge (75:43 - 75:47)
building and when you go up to the (75:45 - 75:50)
second floor of that building there is a (75:47 - 75:53)
Starbucks and that Starbucks looks over (75:50 - 75:56)
shabuya Crossing and then the next floor (75:53 - 75:59)
up is an anime manga (75:56 - 76:02)
Cafe and it also looks over shabuya (75:59 - 76:04)
Crossing because it&#39;s literally the next (76:02 - 76:08)
floor up and so floors three and four (76:04 - 76:11)
are that of shabuya like of that anime (76:08 - 76:14)
manga Cafe and then the fifth floor is (76:11 - 76:18)
the Pokemon cafe the TCG Cafe but it (76:14 - 76:20)
doesn&#39;t look over shabuya Crossing (76:18 - 76:23)
there&#39;s no windows um (76:20 - 76:26)
no but so I I went to that building (76:23 - 76:27)
multiple times and what drove me (76:26 - 76:30)
absolutely crazy is when you get to the (76:27 - 76:31)
second floor cuz you have to take the (76:30 - 76:36)
escalator up that the entire Starbucks (76:31 - 76:39)
was packed and disgusting like if you (76:36 - 76:40)
looked at the floor there was trash (76:39 - 76:43)
everywhere and there was not a single (76:40 - 76:47)
Japanese person in this Starbucks it was (76:43 - 76:50)
all tourists and it was crowded and it (76:47 - 76:52)
was packed and it was dirty and all of (76:50 - 76:54)
these people were like oh Starbucks (76:52 - 76:56)
shabuya Crossing which is like like I (76:54 - 76:57)
don&#39;t know if that&#39;s if that&#39;s your (76:56 - 76:58)
thing is (76:57 - 77:01)
Starbucks I don&#39;t know maybe find better (76:58 - 77:03)
coffee I guess uh but when you got to (77:01 - 77:05)
the third floor you could also get (77:03 - 77:08)
coffee they they had a whole coffee bar (77:05 - 77:11)
and it was cheaper and it was quiet and (77:08 - 77:14)
it was nice and you could spend you (77:11 - 77:15)
could get your coffee and like look at (77:14 - 77:17)
shabuya Crossing or you could literally (77:15 - 77:20)
for a thousand more Yen which is like (77:17 - 77:24)
$7 you could get like a private area (77:20 - 77:27)
with a chair that was quiet where you (77:24 - 77:29)
could drink your coffee for an hour and (77:27 - 77:31)
you could look over shabuya Crossing you (77:29 - 77:35)
just had to go a floor up that&#39;s all you (77:31 - 77:37)
had there was two floors you could do (77:35 - 77:39)
you just had to go one more floor you (77:37 - 77:40)
could have you could have you could have (77:39 - 77:42)
easily took your Starbucks up a floor (77:40 - 77:43)
too they wouldn&#39;t have cared because (77:42 - 77:46)
they don&#39;t care that much but like I (77:43 - 77:48)
don&#39;t know what it was what it is about (77:46 - 77:51)
like any anyways going back to Hawaii I (77:48 - 77:54)
thought to myself if I said no or if (77:51 - 77:56)
other creators said no there&#39;s probably (77:54 - 77:57)
somebody else that would be there that (77:56 - 77:59)
would be like I&#39;m in Hawaii let me go (77:57 - 78:01)
get Starbucks getting Starbucks in (77:59 - 78:03)
Hawaii is supporting no one but (78:01 - 78:05)
Starbucks it is not supporting the local (78:03 - 78:07)
businesses there it&#39;s not so I was like (78:05 - 78:09)
with this dilemma of like I don&#39;t want (78:07 - 78:11)
to be an annoying tourist but I also (78:09 - 78:15)
feel obligated as my job to cover this (78:11 - 78:18)
event after like seeing the Starbucks (78:15 - 78:20)
Fiasco and (78:18 - 78:22)
shabuya I didn&#39;t want to like Pat myself (78:20 - 78:24)
on the back but I was like that&#39;s not me (78:22 - 78:28)
I&#39;m not that (78:24 - 78:28)
problem yeah I mean you&#39;re you&#39;re (78:29 - 78:35)
looking into businesses and places to go (78:32 - 78:37)
that native Hawaiians run and that is (78:35 - 78:38)
one of the best things you can do if (78:37 - 78:41)
you&#39;re going to be there for a job yep (78:38 - 78:43)
one of the biggest complaints about t (78:41 - 78:46)
when they say we rely on (78:43 - 78:50)
tourism is a lot of the tourism money (78:46 - 78:52)
goes to corporations that aren&#39;t based (78:50 - 78:55)
in Hawaii that don&#39;t actually (78:52 - 78:59)
go to help Hawaii so one of the (78:55 - 79:00)
arguments and people can make against (78:59 - 79:03)
the saying well Hawaii doesn&#39;t need (79:00 - 79:06)
tourism because h a lot of the tourism (79:03 - 79:09)
dollars that when people go to Hawaii (79:06 - 79:10)
don&#39;t go to Hawaiians they don&#39;t go to (79:09 - 79:12)
Hawaiian businesses they don&#39;t go to (79:10 - 79:14)
Hawaii and anything they go to huge (79:12 - 79:17)
corporations like Starbucks or Hilton or (79:14 - 79:18)
wherever they&#39;re staying for these all (79:17 - 79:21)
expensive reports that don&#39;t benefit (79:18 - 79:25)
Hawaiians um so you can mitigate that by (79:21 - 79:27)
actively choosing to look at Native (79:25 - 79:31)
local businesses there are websites and (79:27 - 79:33)
places that will say how to do Hawaiian (79:31 - 79:37)
tourism more ethically but like you&#39;ll (79:33 - 79:39)
hear a lot of people push back that like (79:37 - 79:42)
Hawaii needs the (79:39 - 79:45)
tourism maybe it&#39;s the the reality is (79:42 - 79:48)
most of it currently does not go back (79:45 - 79:50)
into Hawaii and that&#39;s I think where a (79:48 - 79:53)
lot of the conflict comes from so if you (79:50 - 79:56)
do decide to go like with any country it (79:53 - 79:59)
is best to try to figure out how to (79:56 - 80:02)
support the population that lives there (79:59 - 80:04)
and not the corporations that are making (80:02 - 80:07)
money (80:04 - 80:07)
there also the TCG Lounge in shabuya is (80:08 - 80:15)
fantastic it&#39;s really it&#39;s really cool I (80:11 - 80:16)
me one of the other problems is like a (80:15 - 80:18)
lot of people do Airbnb it&#39;s just (80:16 - 80:21)
funding the crisis of housing there&#39;s (80:18 - 80:24)
not a lot of there&#39;s not a lot of island (80:21 - 80:27)
in Hawaii there&#39;s not a lot of housings (80:24 - 80:28)
so the more people that use things like (80:27 - 80:32)
Airbnb that encourage corporations to (80:28 - 80:34)
buy housing that should go to people who (80:32 - 80:36)
live there those are all things to (80:34 - 80:38)
consider when you&#39;re going to these (80:36 - 80:43)
places like what is the reality like if (80:38 - 80:47)
I find an Airbnb is is it like how did (80:43 - 80:49)
this how did this house come to be why (80:47 - 80:52)
are you doing this it&#39;s like same (80:49 - 80:54)
problem with New York like a lot of (80:52 - 80:56)
places are cracking down on Airbnb (80:54 - 80:59)
because of the housing crisis so just if (80:56 - 81:01)
you&#39;re going to go to these things again (80:59 - 81:04)
try to do it with the (81:01 - 81:07)
best intentions for the people who (81:04 - 81:08)
actually live there that might benefit (81:07 - 81:11)
from you coming and spending money (81:08 - 81:14)
there yeah I also think tourism is like (81:11 - 81:16)
up everywhere like I think like Japan&#39;s (81:14 - 81:19)
over tour has over tourism I think (81:16 - 81:21)
France does right now which is only (81:19 - 81:22)
going to get worse because the Olympics (81:21 - 81:26)
is happening this year um (81:22 - 81:28)
those poor people I think Spain has (81:26 - 81:32)
reported that they&#39;re more tourism than (81:28 - 81:34)
expected (81:32 - 81:37)
uh which like like I&#39;m not like the (81:34 - 81:39)
point of the the the segment I guess (81:37 - 81:41)
isn&#39;t to like make you feel bad for (81:39 - 81:43)
taking a vacation it&#39;s just like be (81:41 - 81:46)
respectful when you go to a place and (81:43 - 81:47)
then you won&#39;t be part of the problem (81:46 - 81:50)
right like yeah try to limit your (81:47 - 81:52)
negative impact when going to these (81:50 - 81:56)
places yeah (81:52 - 81:58)
um and I know like Pokemon did a really (81:56 - 82:00)
from what I&#39;ve from the couple things (81:58 - 82:04)
I&#39;ve been told of this like Pokemon (82:00 - 82:09)
worlds thing is that they are picking (82:04 - 82:11)
Hawaiian owned businesses or local (82:09 - 82:14)
businesses and they did this in Japan so (82:11 - 82:15)
they already proved that they can do (82:14 - 82:17)
this like in Japan the things they took (82:15 - 82:19)
me to were very like they weren&#39;t like (82:17 - 82:21)
all right well for dinner we&#39;re going to (82:19 - 82:22)
the Red (82:21 - 82:25)
Lobster like like every restaurant they (82:22 - 82:27)
took us to was like oh this this has (82:25 - 82:31)
been a a restaurant that is ex (82:27 - 82:32)
family-owned restaurant that has existed (82:31 - 82:36)
here for 40 some years um and every (82:32 - 82:40)
event we did was very (82:36 - 82:40)
like not corpor yeah I don&#39;t know how to (82:41 - 82:46)
say that like not (82:44 - 82:48)
corporate like not not an American (82:46 - 82:50)
company sitting there where the money (82:48 - 82:53)
just goes right back to America (82:50 - 82:55)
yeah um (82:53 - 82:57)
in case some point (82:55 - 82:59)
Starbucks (82:57 - 83:03)
so uh I guess to wrap the segment up uh (82:59 - 83:07)
I&#39;ll be in Hawaii so I will be live (83:03 - 83:10)
streaming what I can uh I&#39;ll be covering (83:07 - 83:12)
the event the best the best I can I will (83:10 - 83:15)
show you all the activities the best I (83:12 - 83:18)
can and on the plus side of this if (83:15 - 83:21)
there&#39;s any takeaway wherever Pokemon (83:18 - 83:23)
goes next whether that&#39;s a different (83:21 - 83:26)
country or close to you (83:23 - 83:26)
ideally it would be cool if you could go (83:27 - 83:32)
cuz I think these like I I wish more (83:29 - 83:34)
people could have gone to Yokohama I (83:32 - 83:35)
wish people could have gone to London I (83:34 - 83:38)
wish people could go to Hawaii but like (83:35 - 83:41)
timing cost all of that stuff is a (83:38 - 83:43)
factor Hawaii is the hardest state in (83:41 - 83:44)
the United States to get (83:43 - 83:46)
to (83:44 - 83:49)
and from I don&#39;t know maybe a company (83:46 - 83:50)
that said that the Pokemon world (83:49 - 83:52)
championships will be in San Francisco (83:50 - 83:53)
in (83:52 - 83:58)
2026 a lot easier to get to than Hawaii (83:53 - 83:59)
and you&#39;ve got a lot of time to plan (83:58 - 84:03)
ahead for that yep you do you do maybe (83:59 - 84:05)
if you thought about going to California (84:03 - 84:06)
maybe just push that back a little bit (84:05 - 84:09)
maybe line that (84:06 - 84:09)
up still don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing (84:10 - 84:15)
for 2025 I guess in like three months (84:12 - 84:17)
we&#39;ll find out what they&#39;re going to (84:15 - 84:20)
do it&#39;s going to be Minneapolis (84:17 - 84:22)
Minnesota no I (84:20 - 84:25)
don&#39;t this is a nonrelated (84:22 - 84:28)
nonrelated to Pokemon but there&#39;s I feel (84:25 - 84:31)
like WrestleMania for for WWE has been (84:28 - 84:34)
speculated to be in Minneapolis for the (84:31 - 84:38)
last like four years and next year I (84:34 - 84:40)
think was like oh it&#39;s for sure going to (84:38 - 84:42)
be in Minneapolis um it&#39;s not I think (84:40 - 84:45)
they picked Vegas uh but I think (84:42 - 84:47)
Minneapolis is getting (84:45 - 84:49)
SummerSlam which is like you say it (84:47 - 84:51)
enough times you&#39;re bound to be right (84:49 - 84:53)
yeah you keep saying (84:51 - 84:57)
that WrestleMania will be in Minneapolis (84:53 - 84:59)
Minneapolis could handle WrestleMania (84:57 - 85:04)
like US Bank Stadium could handle it oh (84:59 - 85:07)
yeah energy CER could handle it as well (85:04 - 85:09)
like we have two Giant (85:07 - 85:12)
stadiums so I can Target Center for that (85:09 - 85:14)
matter just for the record I I I would (85:12 - 85:16)
not go I would I would still watch it (85:14 - 85:17)
from my (85:16 - 85:19)
house because I don&#39;t want to be around (85:17 - 85:20)
wrestling (85:19 - 85:24)
fans the one time it&#39;s close by it takes (85:20 - 85:25)
nothing (85:24 - 85:27)
so WrestleMania just like Pokemon they (85:25 - 85:31)
have a vents which you can go to but I (85:27 - 85:33)
wouldn&#39;t buy like a seat in the stadium (85:31 - 85:35)
I would like go to all like the events (85:33 - 85:36)
like the meet and greets the like (85:35 - 85:38)
whatever and then I would be like like (85:36 - 85:40)
time to go home to like actually watch (85:38 - 85:42)
it from the comfort of my house not a (85:40 - 85:46)
hard plastic seat that I paid $1,000 for (85:42 - 85:49)
not interested in (85:46 - 85:49)
that I think spectator passes have not (85:51 - 85:56)
fully gone up yet by the time this (85:54 - 85:58)
podcast goes up spectator passes should (85:56 - 86:01)
go up so uh this was a problem in (85:58 - 86:04)
Yokohama where people booked flights and (86:01 - 86:08)
hotels for Japan and then didn&#39;t get a (86:04 - 86:12)
spectator pass and they were very strict (86:08 - 86:13)
about (86:12 - 86:15)
that I don&#39;t think this is going to be (86:13 - 86:17)
as much of a problem (86:15 - 86:22)
since Hawaii is harder to get to than (86:17 - 86:25)
Japan plus Japan really I don&#39;t know if (86:22 - 86:28)
you guys know this Japan really likes (86:25 - 86:32)
Pokemon a lot and it&#39;s very easy to get (86:28 - 86:35)
around that country so understandable (86:32 - 86:40)
why Yokohama had its limit of people and (86:35 - 86:43)
they were they were very strict (86:40 - 86:46)
about not going over that spectator (86:43 - 86:49)
passes for this one for this years&#39;s are (86:46 - 86:50)
still a little bit complicated though (86:49 - 86:53)
they&#39;re not expensive necessarily the (86:50 - 86:56)
single day is still only $15 kind of (86:53 - 86:56)
like the (86:56 - 87:00)
Regionals um multi-day pass is (86:56 - 87:04)
$40 but you do have to beforehand add (87:00 - 87:08)
your name to a list for a lottery to be (87:04 - 87:11)
able to get the opportunity to buy a (87:08 - 87:13)
spectator pass so I think that&#39;s on the (87:11 - 87:16)
Pokemon world world&#39;s (87:13 - 87:16)
website so a little bit a little bit of (87:17 - 87:22)
complexity there something you want to (87:21 - 87:26)
be aware of (87:22 - 87:26)
yeah and if you don&#39;t get a spectator (87:27 - 87:30)
pass I (87:29 - 87:33)
don&#39;t you&#39;re locked out of a lot you&#39;re (87:30 - 87:35)
locked out of almost everything besides (87:33 - 87:38)
like the Pokemon go spawns besides the (87:35 - 87:40)
Pokemon go spawns and it sounds like (87:38 - 87:42)
some of the photo opportunities too but (87:40 - 87:44)
you won&#39;t be able to go in and actually (87:42 - 87:47)
spectate for sure (87:44 - 87:51)
yeah and I think for both Yokohama and (87:47 - 87:51)
London no for for London you had to go (87:52 - 87:59)
inside the XL Center so you did not need (87:55 - 88:02)
a spectator pass to go inside the XL (87:59 - 88:04)
Center so you could walk to right (88:02 - 88:06)
outside where they were checking for (88:04 - 88:08)
spectator passes and you could redeem (88:06 - 88:10)
your siny (88:08 - 88:13)
there um so you didn&#39;t need a spectator (88:10 - 88:14)
pass to get I&#39;m not not that I&#39;m saying (88:13 - 88:16)
you should fly to Hawaii to get a (88:14 - 88:18)
digital Pokemon don&#39;t do that I&#39;m just (88:16 - 88:19)
saying that like if you were in London (88:18 - 88:21)
and you didn&#39;t have a pass you could (88:19 - 88:22)
still get like the Cy and you could (88:21 - 88:25)
still see a lot of stuff in the EXL (88:22 - 88:28)
Center in Yokohama there was still a lot (88:25 - 88:31)
of stuff to do because they pretty much (88:28 - 88:33)
tore down that whole city with Pikachu (88:31 - 88:35)
Merchant like Pikachu is just everywhere (88:33 - 88:37)
in that City so no matter where you went (88:35 - 88:39)
you saw Pikachu um but in Yokohama they (88:37 - 88:41)
were handing (88:39 - 88:46)
out um codes like code cards with I (88:41 - 88:47)
don&#39;t even remember what the (88:46 - 88:50)
distribution was for (88:47 - 88:50)
yokahama I&#39;m blanking on what it was (88:50 - 88:55)
gosh did I even redeem it I think I (88:56 - 89:03)
did but um but they they were handing (89:00 - 89:05)
out code cards to people so again you (89:03 - 89:06)
didn&#39;t have to have spectator tickets (89:05 - 89:07)
they were handing them out in the mall (89:06 - 89:09)
they were handing them outside the venue (89:07 - 89:12)
they were um so I remember I remember (89:09 - 89:15)
getting a bunch of spectator ticket or (89:12 - 89:16)
distributions for like the slack in the (89:15 - 89:19)
Discord and just giving them away to (89:16 - 89:21)
people (89:19 - 89:24)
but ideally there should be a Pokemon (89:21 - 89:26)
for every one a worldwide distribution (89:24 - 89:28)
and then there would be the I was at the (89:26 - 89:30)
event (89:28 - 89:34)
distribution so that&#39;s exciting I guess (89:30 - 89:38)
but anyways I think that&#39;s our episode (89:34 - 89:40)
