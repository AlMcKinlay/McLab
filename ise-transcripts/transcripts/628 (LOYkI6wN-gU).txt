something some something in the (1:07 - 1:12)
somewhere between 18 and 99 it&#39;s (1:09 - 1:15)
somewhere in that range perfect I like (1:12 - 1:16)
how ominous it (1:15 - 1:20)
[Laughter] (1:16 - 1:23)
is we have some (1:20 - 1:26)
pretty non-typical Pokemon news this (1:23 - 1:30)
week so kind of an exciting episode (1:26 - 1:32)
there&#39;s a lot of like weird little (1:30 - 1:33)
things that have happened a lot of weird (1:32 - 1:36)
things are (1:33 - 1:39)
happening uh but because uh because our (1:36 - 1:41)
episodes have continued to start with (1:39 - 1:42)
Pokemon sleep we are going to start with (1:41 - 1:46)
Pokemon sleep which we recorded last (1:42 - 1:49)
week&#39;s episode a little bit early I (1:46 - 1:50)
think it was because there was a (1:49 - 1:52)
community day there&#39;s a Community Day (1:50 - 1:54)
community and so we didn&#39;t find out what (1:52 - 1:58)
day seven was of the seven days of (1:54 - 2:02)
Pokemon sleep (1:58 - 2:05)
anniversary which which overall has been (2:02 - 2:07)
a very good anniversary it was two weeks (2:05 - 2:11)
they gave everyone like what 800 free (2:07 - 2:13)
gems they gave everyone extra incense (2:11 - 2:18)
there was the sixth day get your main (2:13 - 2:20)
skill seed and your points (2:18 - 2:23)
and a lot of free stuff they have given (2:20 - 2:26)
more free stuff in one day in this game (2:23 - 2:29)
than Niantic has given in eight (2:26 - 2:30)
years oh (2:29 - 2:34)
whatever Pokémon go is but uh on the (2:30 - 2:37)
show I I said I wonder or I thought that (2:34 - 2:40)
day s was going to be a new island (2:37 - 2:42)
because that kind of seems like the (2:40 - 2:45)
thing that would get people excited and (2:42 - 2:47)
I don&#39;t think anyone predicted what day (2:45 - 2:50)
seven was going to (2:47 - 2:54)
be which was they are bringing ribbons (2:50 - 2:56)
to Pokemon sleep uh they are going to (2:54 - 2:59)
feature the good night (2:56 - 3:01)
ribbon it is meant to help you feel (2:59 - 3:04)
closer to your helper Pokémon we plan to (3:01 - 3:06)
add it in an update in early (3:04 - 3:08)
August if you don&#39;t know what a good (3:06 - 3:11)
night ribbon is that&#39;s I&#39;m here to tell (3:08 - 3:13)
you that&#39;s what we&#39;re here (3:11 - 3:16)
for uh helper Pokemon can now get a good (3:13 - 3:18)
night ribbon based on the amount of (3:16 - 3:20)
sleeping time you&#39;ve shared you can see (3:18 - 3:22)
the Pokemon&#39;s good night ribbon along (3:20 - 3:24)
with its effects and your shared sleep (3:22 - 3:27)
time on the Pokemon detail screen from (3:24 - 3:29)
the home screen tap the Pokemon tap the (3:27 - 3:31)
Pokemon box then tap the individual (3:29 - 3:34)
Pokemon getting a good night ribbon will (3:31 - 3:36)
raise some stats of the helping Pokemon (3:34 - 3:38)
the effect it has on the (3:36 - 3:41)
stats depends on which of the four (3:38 - 3:43)
levels of the good night ribbon it is (3:41 - 3:45)
you know what&#39;s funny is unite also have (3:43 - 3:48)
ribbons you can have the what is it like (3:45 - 3:52)
green then blue then green blue and then (3:48 - 3:55)
purple gold I think oh gold I hear the I (3:52 - 3:57)
hear the main Series has ribbons too (3:55 - 3:59)
yeah except black and white that&#39;s not (3:57 - 4:00)
true that&#39;s just that&#39;s (3:59 - 4:03)
rumor they were like we forgot all about (4:00 - 4:08)
ribbons from Gen 4 to Gen 6 just skipped (4:03 - 4:10)
everything uh they are unlocked based on (4:08 - 4:12)
the amount of sleeping time shared with (4:10 - 4:14)
your Pokemon after you reach the third (4:12 - 4:16)
level of a ribbon you will get a special (4:14 - 4:18)
profile icon of that Pokemon that&#39;s (4:16 - 4:20)
really cool I actually didn&#39;t read that (4:18 - 4:23)
the first time in addition if a helper (4:20 - 4:26)
Pokemon is still able to evolve then it (4:23 - 4:28)
will get additional boost to its helping (4:26 - 4:30)
stats with the effect effects of the (4:28 - 4:32)
good night ribbon it might be easier to (4:30 - 4:35)
include unevolved Pokemon that could (4:32 - 4:38)
couldn&#39;t help out as much before on your (4:35 - 4:41)
team the number of times a Pokemon can (4:38 - 4:43)
evolve depend on which Pokemon are (4:41 - 4:44)
included in Pokemon sleep I think (4:43 - 4:48)
they&#39;re saying that because like a nyap (4:44 - 4:51)
is not in the game so your (4:48 - 4:54)
primeape can&#39;t get the unevolved (4:51 - 4:56)
benefits because a nyip just doesn&#39;t (4:54 - 4:58)
exist right (4:56 - 5:01)
now um there&#39;s probably other Pokemon (4:58 - 5:03)
that matter for (5:01 - 5:06)
but yeah definitely know Prim a is in (5:03 - 5:09)
the game well probably like other and (5:06 - 5:11)
then other Pokemon that don&#39;t have baby (5:09 - 5:13)
Pokemon yet in the game I mean it&#39;s just (5:11 - 5:16)
there&#39;s just levels right where there (5:13 - 5:19)
isn&#39;t the evolution to go to I don&#39;t (5:16 - 5:21)
know what baby Pokemon are&#39;t in the game (5:19 - 5:25)
actually but uh I think all the there (5:21 - 5:28)
are quite a few babies but they can all (5:25 - 5:32)
evolve Riolu Clea eagly yeah I guess (5:28 - 5:34)
everything that in there already has the (5:32 - 5:35)
baby Pokemon in there it doesn&#39;t it I (5:34 - 5:37)
can&#39;t think of a baby that&#39;s not in (5:35 - 5:40)
there just toxle but because tcity is (5:37 - 5:43)
not in tcity isn&#39;t in it man technically (5:40 - 5:45)
I guess isn&#39;t in man that&#39;s a baby (5:43 - 5:47)
Mantine thing okay well never mind my (5:45 - 5:50)
comment then uh okay uh ribbon one you (5:47 - 5:53)
need two hour 200 hours of sleep that (5:50 - 5:56)
will increase your carry limit by one um (5:53 - 5:59)
ribbon two you need 500 hours of sleep (5:56 - 6:01)
with that specific Pokemon I should say (5:59 - 6:02)
uh it will increase your carrier limit (6:01 - 6:05)
of two if a Pokemon is still uh can (6:02 - 6:07)
still evolve for example Pikachu helping (6:05 - 6:10)
frequency is shortened by 5% if a (6:07 - 6:13)
Pokemon can evolve twice example Pichu (6:10 - 6:15)
the helping frequency is shortened by (6:13 - 6:17)
11% uh once you hit a th000 hours your (6:15 - 6:20)
carry limit will be plus three and then (6:17 - 6:22)
you will get that special profile icon (6:20 - 6:24)
of said Pokemon and then if you have (6:22 - 6:27)
2,000 hours of sleeping time shared I (6:24 - 6:28)
don&#39;t know if this is retroactive I (6:27 - 6:31)
would assume so since they said (6:28 - 6:33)
it would be weird if it wasn&#39;t yeah they (6:31 - 6:35)
do say like you can currently check it (6:33 - 6:36)
by going (6:35 - 6:38)
to the I literally read it 10 minutes (6:36 - 6:41)
five minutes ago uh level four is 2,000 (6:38 - 6:43)
hours of sleep carry limit another plus (6:41 - 6:46)
two and then if a Pokemon can still (6:43 - 6:50)
evolve like Pikachu you will have a (6:46 - 6:54)
7% it&#39;s 7% but they&#39;re adding the 5% so (6:50 - 6:57)
it&#39;s total of 12% shorter and then if (6:54 - 7:03)
it&#39;s a Pichu it is 25% (6:57 - 7:03)
shorter (7:04 - 7:10)
um the people already did the math the (7:06 - 7:12)
the the number one Pokemon this matters (7:10 - 7:15)
for the most if you want a min max is (7:12 - 7:19)
onx if you don&#39;t evolve Onyx to Steelix (7:15 - 7:23)
it will technically outperform Steelix (7:19 - 7:26)
but Onyx is a rock type Pokemon in the (7:23 - 7:27)
game and Steelix is a Steel type Pokemon (7:26 - 7:30)
in the game so you would keep keep Onyx (7:27 - 7:31)
at (7:30 - 7:36)
topalo and you would not use Steelix (7:31 - 7:38)
anywhere cuz there&#39;s not a steel (7:36 - 7:42)
Island and I also don&#39;t have a onx (7:38 - 7:45)
so great I guess top hollo is where I&#39;m (7:42 - 7:47)
going if I want (7:45 - 7:50)
to yeah there was also there was (7:47 - 7:54)
also vigoroth technically is faster than (7:50 - 7:59)
slack slacking but slacking has more (7:54 - 8:01)
ingredient power or something there (7:59 - 8:03)
there was an argument to keep your (8:01 - 8:04)
vigoroth a (8:03 - 8:07)
vigoroth um so this makes vigoth (8:04 - 8:11)
better but onx Onyx is the one that (8:07 - 8:14)
technically is like if if you are Min (8:11 - 8:17)
maxing mhm then do not evolve your Onyx (8:14 - 8:19)
and sleep with your Onyx for 2,000 hours (8:17 - 8:22)
and then get the ribbon on (8:19 - 8:22)
it I would assume the majority of people (8:23 - 8:28)
are just going to ribbon a Pokemon they (8:26 - 8:30)
like and I think that is fine you&#39;re (8:28 - 8:33)
carry limit going up is still (8:30 - 8:36)
beneficial does it do you choose or do (8:33 - 8:39)
they just get (8:36 - 8:39)
it yeah (8:39 - 8:44)
I it just it just gets right it&#39;s almost (8:41 - 8:46)
like a it&#39;s just like a almost like (8:44 - 8:48)
leveling it right you you get it to (8:46 - 8:50)
level 30 and you get extra stuff right (8:48 - 8:52)
you get this many sleep hours with it (8:50 - 8:56)
and you get because my is at 2500 hours (8:52 - 8:59)
so I&#39;m assuming that just happens right (8:56 - 9:01)
like (8:59 - 9:03)
it&#39;s just gonna appear they&#39;re like hey (9:01 - 9:05)
good job Butterfree so the the thing (9:03 - 9:07)
your Butterfree would get (9:05 - 9:10)
is a carry limit of (9:07 - 9:14)
67 68 it would have an carry limit of (9:10 - 9:18)
eight but no helping bonus because it&#39;s (9:14 - 9:21)
evolved yeah right but you would get (9:18 - 9:23)
that profile (9:21 - 9:28)
icon um my Charizard is 1,255 (9:23 - 9:28)
good job Charizard see the ribbon um (9:29 - 9:36)
like it&#39;s not on the Pokemon it&#39;s only (9:34 - 9:38)
in the detail screen right so it&#39;s not (9:36 - 9:40)
like it&#39;s on it when it&#39;s in the oh I (9:38 - 9:44)
hope that they like pin a ribbon on the (9:40 - 9:47)
Pokemon that is like standing in the (9:44 - 9:50)
field I mean they have pinned ribbons in (9:47 - 9:53)
Pokemon go of all places yeah that&#39;s (9:50 - 9:55)
true well in pke okay the ribbons in (9:53 - 9:57)
Pokémon go also yeah I guess you&#39;re (9:55 - 10:00)
right there are ribbons in Pokémon go I (9:57 - 10:02)
love when like the like when you don&#39;t (10:00 - 10:04)
look up where the ribbon is going to end (10:02 - 10:07)
up being yeah it&#39;s some of them are very (10:04 - 10:11)
weird places and I&#39;m like (10:07 - 10:14)
why why did you put it (10:11 - 10:17)
there the choices they make of where to (10:14 - 10:19)
slap the ribbon are really great like (10:17 - 10:23)
salazzle is like right on her head like (10:19 - 10:25)
you could put it on her she has like a (10:23 - 10:27)
whole body and chest but they were like (10:25 - 10:29)
nope we&#39;re going to slap it right on her (10:27 - 10:33)
forehead same with um same with poo like (10:29 - 10:35)
poo has a whole neck thing that it could (10:33 - 10:38)
literally be on nope right there right (10:35 - 10:40)
on the forehead right there it might be (10:38 - 10:41)
really one of the best things Niantic (10:40 - 10:44)
has done is is is the random placement (10:41 - 10:46)
of ribbons I think there&#39;s a committee (10:44 - 10:47)
that was like all right we have this (10:46 - 10:49)
Pokemon where&#39;s the weirdest place we (10:47 - 10:50)
can stick (10:49 - 10:54)
this job at Niantic was place the ribbon (10:50 - 10:56)
for 600 plus (10:54 - 10:59)
Pokemon I I think I think this is really (10:56 - 11:03)
cool I think that (10:59 - 11:03)
like there there hasn&#39;t been any like (11:04 - 11:09)
Nerfs that I can think of obvious Nerfs (11:06 - 11:11)
or intentional Nerfs in Pokemon sleep (11:09 - 11:12)
that is (11:11 - 11:16)
like punishing us for playing there has (11:12 - 11:19)
been like the bug fixes of like people (11:16 - 11:21)
trying to like hack (11:19 - 11:25)
their Plus+ Pikachu to max out the level (11:21 - 11:28)
or whatever like yes there&#39;s that but (11:25 - 11:31)
like I feel like every change or feature (11:28 - 11:33)
they&#39;ve added to the game has just (11:31 - 11:35)
benefited players for playing like thank (11:33 - 11:38)
you for playing we&#39;re making your (11:35 - 11:40)
experience playing more (11:38 - 11:43)
enjoyable so I think this is really cool (11:40 - 11:45)
uh I do think there&#39;s like I don&#39;t want (11:43 - 11:49)
to say it&#39;s like a Nerf but I do think (11:45 - 11:53)
it does change some people&#39;s strategies (11:49 - 11:54)
uh for (11:53 - 11:57)
example I have seen it where people will (11:54 - 12:00)
put the berry Pokemon on their team (11:57 - 12:02)
before they go to bed so like that would (12:00 - 12:05)
be be like a Meganium or a Typhlosion or (12:02 - 12:08)
or whatever and then in the morning when (12:05 - 12:11)
the berry Pokemon are all collected they (12:08 - 12:13)
are swapped out for ingredients and then (12:11 - 12:15)
the ingredient Pokemon run through the (12:13 - 12:17)
day and then you get back to nighttime (12:15 - 12:18)
and then you swap them back out for (12:17 - 12:21)
berries to like optimize it because once (12:18 - 12:25)
ingredient Pokemon fill up they they (12:21 - 12:26)
kind of fill up and then once Barry (12:25 - 12:28)
Pokemon fill up you get the like sneaky (12:26 - 12:30)
snacking or whatever which is (12:28 - 12:32)
they&#39;re the berry Pokemon are good at (12:30 - 12:33)
getting berries so you would get more (12:32 - 12:38)
sneaky snacking right this would in some (12:33 - 12:41)
instances discourage that if you are (12:38 - 12:43)
looking to get the (12:41 - 12:45)
ribbon on the Pokemon and you are (12:43 - 12:48)
frequently switching out teams which (12:45 - 12:50)
nothing wrong with switching out teams (12:48 - 12:52)
it would just you just have to plan a (12:50 - 12:53)
lot better of like okay how am I going (12:52 - 12:56)
to get this energy back am I going to (12:53 - 12:57)
assign it the next night am I going to (12:56 - 13:01)
use pillows am I MH how am I getting the (12:57 - 13:03)
energy back (13:01 - 13:03)
but what a what a cool surprise after a (13:04 - 13:11)
year to be like yeah let&#39;s add ribbons (13:08 - 13:14)
yeah and and yeah it&#39;s got to be (13:11 - 13:17)
retroactive because that would be wild (13:14 - 13:19)
to like have done all this over year and (13:17 - 13:21)
then it&#39;s just starting over so I think (13:19 - 13:24)
it is cool to like you&#39;ll automatically (13:21 - 13:27)
see the ribbon with these certain (13:24 - 13:29)
Pokemon who you have been like had a lot (13:27 - 13:31)
of you know sleep with over the last (13:29 - 13:33)
year which is cool just a nice little uh (13:31 - 13:36)
something extra there for for what (13:33 - 13:38)
you&#39;ve been doing but not toward (13:36 - 13:39)
anything and now it now it&#39;s you know (13:38 - 13:42)
giving you a little extra (13:39 - 13:42)
something yeah I do I do know the (13:45 - 13:49)
current meta is is looking for Pokemon (13:47 - 13:52)
that have like the same ingredient so (13:49 - 13:55)
for example like with miara you might (13:52 - 13:58)
want all potatoes or with with beware (13:55 - 14:00)
you would want all corn (13:58 - 14:01)
and that is the current meta and that&#39;s (14:00 - 14:04)
not like how the game started so I (14:01 - 14:06)
wonder if there&#39;s going to be like a (14:04 - 14:07)
change in the (14:06 - 14:10)
future I like I don&#39;t think the ribbons (14:07 - 14:12)
is like changing the meta at all GNA (14:10 - 14:14)
overpower that I I just think the the (14:12 - 14:16)
ribbons is like a nice thing that (14:14 - 14:18)
rewards you for playing a lot but I do (14:16 - 14:22)
wonder if like there&#39;s a Pokemon or an (14:18 - 14:24)
ability or something else they could add (14:22 - 14:27)
to the game that would like shake up or (14:24 - 14:29)
change the meta like remember when the (14:27 - 14:31)
game first started like Psyduck was a (14:29 - 14:32)
terrible (14:31 - 14:34)
Pokemon and about like six months into (14:32 - 14:38)
the game Golduck is Apparently one of (14:34 - 14:40)
the best Pokemon that you you could have (14:38 - 14:45)
only if you have a very specific (14:40 - 14:48)
gold the phrase I&#39;m still trying to get (14:45 - 14:51)
over the phrase the Pokemon sleep meta (14:48 - 14:54)
that is just not sitting well with me (14:51 - 14:56)
right now and I am I am taking a (14:54 - 15:01)
personal day to recover (14:56 - 15:03)
I think the great thing it&#39;s probably (15:01 - 15:06)
similar to Pokemon go in a sense like (15:03 - 15:08)
the great thing about it is you you (15:06 - 15:11)
don&#39;t have to like look at charts or to (15:08 - 15:14)
like look up stuff to enjoy Pokemon (15:11 - 15:17)
sleep M you can just play it and it&#39;s (15:14 - 15:19)
fine and for the most part like the (15:17 - 15:22)
game&#39;s not asking a lot of you yeah and (15:19 - 15:23)
I&#39;ve seen (15:22 - 15:27)
personally like as I like I also for the (15:23 - 15:30)
record my I I&#39;ve given this game $100 in (15:27 - 15:32)
the last year cuz it&#39;s $50 for the first (15:30 - 15:34)
six months and then $50 for the second (15:32 - 15:38)
six months and I just saw that the the (15:34 - 15:41)
Third charge of $50 will be on August (15:38 - 15:44)
3rd for me for the next six months are (15:41 - 15:47)
are you going to you have time to to (15:44 - 15:50)
rethink this is the moment this is when (15:47 - 15:52)
you can go in and (15:50 - 15:58)
say you know what no I can spend $50 (15:52 - 16:00)
elsewhere you know I&#39;m glad you brought (15:58 - 16:02)
that up Greg because I did consider (16:00 - 16:07)
cancelling it not because I don&#39;t enjoy (16:02 - 16:10)
the game or like I&#39;m done with it but I (16:07 - 16:12)
have seen so many free-to-play players (16:10 - 16:17)
yourself included Greg get to similar (16:12 - 16:20)
levels yeah I&#39;m at 55 right right right (16:17 - 16:22)
that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying (16:20 - 16:25)
like you can definitely whail in this (16:22 - 16:29)
game you can definitely drop money buy (16:25 - 16:31)
buy your your whistles buy your poke (16:29 - 16:33)
biscuits catch every you like you could (16:31 - 16:35)
literally probably catch everything (16:33 - 16:37)
every single night to like get more (16:35 - 16:39)
candy and then throw those Pokemon away (16:37 - 16:42)
to get even more candy and get better (16:39 - 16:44)
Pokemon faster because like once you get (16:42 - 16:46)
10 of a Pokemon the 11th and on are like (16:44 - 16:48)
slightly better and then once you get I (16:46 - 16:50)
think it&#39;s like is it 30 or is a 40 then (16:48 - 16:52)
you&#39;re like two golden permanent instead (16:50 - 16:55)
of one golden per and at 10 like you (16:52 - 16:56)
could definitely (16:55 - 17:00)
whail um and I know there are people in (16:56 - 17:02)
slack our slack Community if you want to (17:00 - 17:04)
join patreon there&#39;s probably an ad (17:02 - 17:06)
somewhere in this episode I&#39;ll tell you (17:04 - 17:07)
to join patreon somewhere in there (17:06 - 17:10)
somewhere in this episode uh I know (17:07 - 17:11)
there are people in the slack community (17:10 - 17:14)
that spend way more money than me (17:11 - 17:16)
because I really give this game I just (17:14 - 17:17)
give this game the $10 a month or (17:16 - 17:19)
whatever for the the (17:17 - 17:21)
pass and I&#39;ll see them post like oh I (17:19 - 17:25)
master rank 17 and I&#39;m like oh well I&#39;m (17:21 - 17:26)
master rank (17:25 - 17:30)
16 and I definitely didn&#39;t spend yeah (17:26 - 17:33)
like like and that&#39;s not to like make (17:30 - 17:35)
those people feel bad or what I don&#39;t (17:33 - 17:37)
know maybe maybe they&#39;ll feel bad you (17:35 - 17:39)
know like I&#39;m not trying to make anyone (17:37 - 17:44)
feel bad I what I am just saying is (17:39 - 17:47)
that you&#39;re not at like this huge (17:44 - 17:48)
disadvantage because you didn&#39;t give the (17:47 - 17:51)
game money like you might be like ah I (17:48 - 17:54)
wish I really could have caught that (17:51 - 17:56)
spatio today but the thing about Pokemon (17:54 - 17:58)
sleep is that spatio will come back (17:56 - 18:02)
tomorrow day M I got a Flor out of (17:58 - 18:03)
nowhere just showed up I&#39;m like hey (18:02 - 18:05)
buddy (18:03 - 18:08)
M uh speaking uh just as a sidebar (18:05 - 18:10)
speaking of cancelling your memberships (18:08 - 18:13)
uh anybody who pays for Pokemon unite (18:10 - 18:15)
you might want to reconsider that uh at (18:13 - 18:17)
the end of (18:15 - 18:19)
August oh because that they&#39;re like (18:17 - 18:21)
they&#39;re changing that membership is the (18:19 - 18:25)
rumor yeah far the worse like really (18:21 - 18:28)
really if what has been discovered is (18:25 - 18:30)
true and it generally is cuz we&#39;re a (18:28 - 18:34)
month out it&#39;s it&#39;s bad well the The (18:30 - 18:37)
Meta of the Pokemon unite meta of the (18:34 - 18:40)
subscription was to subscribe mid (18:37 - 18:44)
Monon get your free costume the next (18:40 - 18:48)
month rolls over get your second costume (18:44 - 18:52)
cancel wait 30 days and then resubscribe (18:48 - 18:55)
mid so really you could get a year worth (18:52 - 18:58)
of costumes if you planned it out well (18:55 - 19:03)
uh gu guess what costumes are gone (18:58 - 19:03)
so hey I I subscribed to my DJ crar an (19:03 - 19:12)
costume and then I canceled I got I got (19:09 - 19:16)
what I wanted uh yeah uh I would if you (19:12 - 19:19)
play if you pay for your night (19:16 - 19:23)
um I maybe don&#39;t after after maybe (19:19 - 19:26)
don&#39;t I mean you may find the the much (19:23 - 19:29)
worse subcription (19:26 - 19:32)
better it it is objectively worse for (19:29 - 19:35)
the same amount of money uh you might (19:32 - 19:38)
want to just uh put that cancel in uh so (19:35 - 19:41)
in the past it was you would get a (19:38 - 19:43)
costume if you had the subscription each (19:41 - 19:45)
month you would get a costume so y month (19:43 - 19:47)
rolls over you get that second one you (19:45 - 19:49)
cancel and then you wait till the (19:47 - 19:51)
following month and get that costume and (19:49 - 19:54)
it rolls over and okay yeah I I see yeah (19:51 - 19:58)
uh but no more no more no more no more (19:54 - 20:00)
Hollow (19:58 - 20:01)
they&#39;re got (20:00 - 20:04)
allegedly uh there the amount of gems (20:01 - 20:06)
you are allegedly getting is being (20:04 - 20:09)
lowered uh used to get 40 a day they&#39;re (20:06 - 20:10)
dropping it to (20:09 - 20:14)
30 um they&#39;re (20:10 - 20:16)
just uh and they&#39;re also one of the (20:14 - 20:18)
other things one of the other things is (20:16 - 20:22)
used to get rank protection cards so if (20:18 - 20:23)
you were (20:22 - 20:26)
Ultra two and you one away from going to (20:23 - 20:28)
ultra 1 if you had a rank protection (20:26 - 20:31)
guard and you lost you wouldn&#39;t actually (20:28 - 20:32)
go one you wouldn&#39;t go further down (20:31 - 20:35)
you&#39;d stay one away and apparently those (20:32 - 20:37)
are also being removed from the paid (20:35 - 20:40)
subscriptions so that that benefit (20:37 - 20:42)
protection is potentially (20:40 - 20:45)
gone um just a bunch of stuff that they (20:42 - 20:46)
removing (20:45 - 20:50)
so I we&#39;re at this point in the (20:46 - 20:53)
situation where we&#39;re a month out and it (20:50 - 20:57)
seems very real uh but maybe review it (20:53 - 20:59)
at the end of August to be like am I (20:57 - 21:01)
still going to pay for is it still the (20:59 - 21:05)
benefit because it&#39;s it&#39;s bad this is (21:01 - 21:07)
this will eventually come to sleep like (21:05 - 21:09)
in a way where like the subscription (21:07 - 21:12)
will change in some way and so I think (21:09 - 21:14)
the the message here is review your (21:12 - 21:17)
subscriptions don&#39;t just let them run (21:14 - 21:19)
for months and months and months at a (21:17 - 21:22)
time okay do you&#39;all know what Robo (21:19 - 21:25)
killer is on your phone yeah yeah I used (21:22 - 21:28)
to I I paid for that for a a bit did you (21:25 - 21:32)
just say what they did no oh I I so I (21:28 - 21:34)
paid for it because you pay for a year (21:32 - 21:37)
whatever I was like yeah cuz when I was (21:34 - 21:38)
searching for a job I was getting a (21:37 - 21:40)
million spam calls sure so I&#39;m like (21:38 - 21:42)
finally going to pay for it and at the (21:40 - 21:45)
time I was like well a year for (21:42 - 21:47)
$39.99 you know that&#39;s not a terrible (21:45 - 21:49)
price no I feel like when I subscribed (21:47 - 21:51)
for the year it was like 20 bucks but (21:49 - 21:53)
that was like five years ago uh starting (21:51 - 21:57)
August 5th (21:53 - 21:57)
$89.99 what (21:57 - 22:01)
$89 (21:59 - 22:06)
90 they didn&#39;t even that almost tripled (22:01 - 22:11)
it for for no reason like I the do you (22:06 - 22:13)
remember do you remember when companies (22:11 - 22:15)
would increase the cost of their (22:13 - 22:17)
subscriptions because like Co that was (22:15 - 22:19)
the reason yeah because that was the (22:17 - 22:21)
reason Co I mean we we can&#39;t use that (22:19 - 22:26)
anymore yeah the I will say this to uh (22:21 - 22:28)
Apple&#39;s credit my iPhone said hey this (22:26 - 22:31)
subscription has decided to raise it to (22:28 - 22:34)
$90 is this something you want to do and (22:31 - 22:37)
I was like hard pass immediate cancel (22:34 - 22:41)
nope like I could justify it a little (22:37 - 22:45)
bit at the $40 (22:41 - 22:49)
range no nope nope I mean I could I (22:45 - 22:51)
could see somebody who is on the phone a (22:49 - 22:55)
lot that needs to answer their phone (22:51 - 22:57)
that are like looking forward to calls I (22:55 - 22:59)
I I definitely see that like I in the (22:57 - 23:01)
same predicament where when I was (22:59 - 23:03)
looking at my Pokemon sleep subscription (23:01 - 23:06)
and I was like maybe I maybe I cancel (23:03 - 23:07)
this I don&#39;t know I&#39;m I&#39;m still enjoying (23:06 - 23:09)
the game like I if I canceled it I would (23:07 - 23:10)
still play obviously it would just be (23:09 - 23:12)
like I got 50 bucks in my pocket I saw I (23:10 - 23:15)
had another subscription to a calendar I (23:12 - 23:17)
use Fantastical I&#39;ve used it for a (23:15 - 23:21)
decade and it has slowly increased its (23:17 - 23:23)
price a (23:21 - 23:25)
lot (23:23 - 23:29)
and I use my calendar every single day I (23:25 - 23:31)
live by my calendar if an event is not (23:29 - 23:34)
in my calendar it does not exist to me (23:31 - 23:37)
like it it is I it it&#39;s I&#39;m just (23:34 - 23:40)
calendar blind when it comes to like oh (23:37 - 23:42)
I was supposed to hang out with Greg I I (23:40 - 23:45)
it wasn&#39;t in my calendar so I I I guess (23:42 - 23:47)
I ghosted Greg my (23:45 - 23:49)
bad the thought that I wouldn&#39;t have (23:47 - 23:52)
been texting you like hello true where (23:49 - 23:54)
are (23:52 - 23:57)
you uh but now now I&#39;m like okay I have (23:54 - 23:59)
like 20 days to find a a brand new (23:57 - 24:02)
calendar because I just don&#39;t want to (23:59 - 24:06)
pay it&#39;s it&#39;s up to like $90 a year what (24:02 - 24:09)
for really I remember it was like 36 (24:06 - 24:10)
when they went to Subscription Service (24:09 - 24:13)
it was like 36 a year 30 well well I (24:10 - 24:16)
have like the the family calendar okay (24:13 - 24:17)

three people to a calendar is not server (24:20 - 24:29)
breaking I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s not (24:24 - 24:31)
oh the problem it&#39;s like all the server (24:29 - 24:33)
power is being eaten by AI anyway so you (24:31 - 24:35)
created this problem because you want an (24:33 - 24:37)
AI to tell me how to fill out my own (24:35 - 24:39)

information do you actually need from (25:18 - 25:24)
your weather app like for me it&#39;s not so (25:19 - 25:28)
much like I need it to do something my (25:24 - 25:32)
$25 a year is like I genuinely like this (25:28 - 25:36)
developer yeah that&#39;s I get that I get (25:32 - 25:39)
that and I would like to see them make (25:36 - 25:42)
other apps and if this $25 and everyone (25:39 - 25:45)
else&#39;s $25 lets this dude because it&#39;s (25:42 - 25:49)

do this fulltime and then he (25:49 - 25:54)
makes I don&#39;t know like a the calorie (25:51 - 25:55)
counting app that&#39;s just as good as the (25:54 - 25:57)

like to see this guy make other apps or (25:57 - 26:03)
a calendar app or a cal yeah what go a (25:59 - 26:05)
calendar make me a calendar app that&#39;s (26:03 - 26:07)
as good as your weather app yeah yeah (26:05 - 26:10)
like like the it is one of the best it&#39;s (26:07 - 26:13)
it&#39;s called carrot not ad or anything (26:10 - 26:15)
but like Brent pays for weather radar (26:13 - 26:18)
because he likes tracking storms and (26:15 - 26:21)
most of those things aren&#39;t free like I (26:18 - 26:23)
get the storm tracker and and carrot as (26:21 - 26:26)
well which yeah most most of that stuff (26:23 - 26:28)
is not free yeah he just watches the (26:26 - 26:29)
storms rolling and then tells me while (26:28 - 26:31)
I&#39;m at the gym hail&#39;s coming I&#39;m like I (26:29 - 26:33)

realize or that I that I didn&#39;t uh you (28:49 - 28:53)

I did and (29:14 - 29:18)
then (29:16 - 29:21)
uh I want to say I I was hoping not (29:18 - 29:23)
hoping but like I really thought there (29:21 - 29:25)
would be a bunch of articles about this (29:23 - 29:27)
or people would be talking about this (29:25 - 29:28)
but people people are not talking about (29:27 - 29:31)
this right now um but I think this is (29:28 - 29:35)
going to be a bigger story very soon I (29:31 - 29:38)
could only find one website like look I (29:35 - 29:39)
don&#39;t want to come on the show and be (29:38 - 29:44)
like the source of today&#39;s news is Tick (29:39 - 29:44)
Tock but I I could only find one blog (29:45 - 29:51)
post or like article about this uh this (29:49 - 29:55)
is Donald Pap from hackaday which (29:51 - 29:57)
actually you know makes sense about the (29:55 - 29:59)
topic we&#39;re about to talk about (29:57 - 30:03)
hackaday.com uh it is sealed packs of (29:59 - 30:05)
Pokemon cards give up their secrets (30:03 - 30:08)
without opening them so even if you (30:05 - 30:10)
don&#39;t collect Pokemon cards I think this (30:08 - 30:12)
is super super (30:10 - 30:14)
interesting I&#39;ll just read what R wrote (30:12 - 30:16)
here uh (30:14 - 30:19)
Aaron Wayne I believe is the person Su (30:16 - 30:21)
succeeded in something he&#39;s been trying (30:19 - 30:23)
to accomplish for some time figuring out (30:21 - 30:25)
what&#39;s inside a sealed Pokemon card pack (30:23 - 30:28)
without opening it also this will not (30:25 - 30:30)
just apply to Pokemon it&#39;s not like (30:28 - 30:32)
there&#39;s some secret here this will apply (30:30 - 30:34)
to Magic (30:32 - 30:36)
Yu-Gi-Oh (30:34 - 30:38)
lurana uh there&#39;s a catch however it (30:36 - 30:41)
took buying an x-ray CT scanner off eBay (30:38 - 30:44)
refurbishing it calibrating it and then (30:41 - 30:46)
putting a load of work into testing and (30:44 - 30:49)
scanning techniques the final combin the (30:46 - 30:51)
then finally combining the data with the (30:49 - 30:53)
machine learning in order to make useful (30:51 - 30:56)
decisions it&#39;s a load of work but Aaron (30:53 - 30:59)
succeeded by developing some genuinely (30:56 - 31:02)
novel techniques the X-ray machine can (30:59 - 31:04)
Peak inside sealed (31:02 - 31:06)
packages (31:04 - 31:10)
uh and they say that it was really hard (31:06 - 31:12)
um but (31:10 - 31:15)
ultimately the X-ray machine can see (31:12 - 31:20)
what Hollow rare is in a pack of Pokemon (31:15 - 31:20)
cards yeah uh it doesn&#39;t see the entire (31:20 - 31:27)
card uh it will see individual features (31:24 - 31:30)
at first like they&#39;re saying like a (31:27 - 31:32)
tentacle from like a Tentacruel or (31:30 - 31:36)
something right or uh or they&#39;ll use (31:32 - 31:40)
symbols uh they can also spot (31:36 - 31:42)
counterfeit (31:40 - 31:42)
cards and then there&#39;s uh that&#39;s that&#39;s (31:43 - 31:50)
kind of it it is it is that this dude (31:46 - 31:53)
bought an x-ray machine and has spent (31:50 - 31:56)
the last couple (31:53 - 31:59)
months trying to find the best way to (31:56 - 32:02)
scan a pack of Pokémon cards to then be (31:59 - 32:04)
like oh there&#39;s a Mewtwo in here or (32:02 - 32:08)
there&#39;s an exeggutor in here or there&#39;s (32:04 - 32:11)
a non Hollow Zarina in (32:08 - 32:16)
here yeah this this is especially bad (32:11 - 32:20)
for vintage because you think about um (32:16 - 32:24)
like B set or fossil or jungle where (32:20 - 32:27)
there&#39;s just the one hollow card in the (32:24 - 32:29)
in the pack (32:27 - 32:30)
right so you&#39;re either you&#39;re going to (32:29 - 32:33)
be able to see not I guess not that (32:30 - 32:34)
easily because of all the work you have (32:33 - 32:36)
to go into doing it but like you can see (32:34 - 32:37)
whether the pack has the hollow or has a (32:36 - 32:41)
specific Hollow card or not um and (32:37 - 32:43)
you&#39;ll be able to you know do that now (32:41 - 32:45)
there&#39;re they already can weigh packs (32:43 - 32:46)
right especially the older the Vintage (32:45 - 32:48)
packs you can weigh them so you go to (32:46 - 32:50)
buy packs for like if you go to buy a (32:48 - 32:54)
vintage pack it will usually the the uh (32:50 - 32:56)
seller will usually say whether it&#39;s (32:54 - 32:59)
been weighed before and they will say (32:56 - 33:01)
whether it&#39;s a heavy pack or a light (32:59 - 33:03)
pack a heavy pack usually contains a (33:01 - 33:05)
holographic card because they&#39;re heavier (33:03 - 33:07)
and so you can get that understanding (33:05 - 33:09)
that way already but this even goes a (33:07 - 33:12)
little the step further to where you can (33:09 - 33:14)
it seems like you can kind of see which (33:12 - 33:18)
holographic card is in the pack (33:14 - 33:21)
which potentially a huge problem for (33:18 - 33:25)
people who keep vintage sealed (33:21 - 33:29)
collections I feel like (33:25 - 33:32)
the cost of investment to buy an x-ray (33:29 - 33:33)
CT (33:32 - 33:35)
machine oh I&#39;m glad I&#39;m glad you brought (33:33 - 33:36)
this (33:35 - 33:40)
up um that (33:36 - 33:40)
feels like what if I told (33:41 - 33:48)
you that you could send your pack to him (33:44 - 33:52)
and he will scan it for (33:48 - 33:52)
$70 which to some people (33:54 - 33:59)
would be worth (33:58 - 34:03)
it because pack packs packs right now (33:59 - 34:07)
are worth more sealed than opened right (34:03 - 34:10)
but like how much more well okay here (34:07 - 34:12)
here&#39;s a here&#39;s a really good example I (34:10 - 34:17)
saw a Tik toac of this of of uh a a (34:12 - 34:21)
mutual of mine went to a uh the card (34:17 - 34:22)
thing in Florida and I don&#39;t remember (34:21 - 34:25)
what that card party or whatever C party (34:22 - 34:28)
yeah yeah card party he went there he (34:25 - 34:29)
was like I bought this heavy pack I (34:28 - 34:30)
don&#39;t remember what it was it was like (34:29 - 34:33)
Neo Destiny or something I could be (34:30 - 34:35)
wrong I don&#39;t remember but he was like I (34:33 - 34:37)
bought this pack for $700 they said it (34:35 - 34:39)
was heavy and Bobby just explained what (34:37 - 34:43)
heavy was right you could get a scale (34:39 - 34:44)
and put the things on and if it weighs a (34:43 - 34:47)
little bit more it technically has a (34:44 - 34:50)
higher chance of having something good (34:47 - 34:51)
and he opened it and the cool thing (34:50 - 34:53)
about like the Tik Tock is was showing (34:51 - 34:55)
all the prices of everything and the the (34:53 - 34:58)
final card was like $200 (34:55 - 35:02)
and they spent and that that was like (34:58 - 35:05)
$200 if I then send this to PSA and then (35:02 - 35:09)
PSA gave it a 10 yeah so even if you (35:05 - 35:11)
then paid extra money to get it graded (35:09 - 35:13)
and then it ended up being a perfect (35:11 - 35:14)
grade (35:13 - 35:16)
which nine times out of 10 it&#39;s not (35:14 - 35:18)
because have you ever seen Pokemon cards (35:16 - 35:20)
they&#39;re never (35:18 - 35:24)
centered uh you still lost (35:20 - 35:27)
$500 on this heavy pack of cards you (35:24 - 35:29)
just (35:27 - 35:32)
it like it was worth more sealed than it (35:29 - 35:36)
was open yeah now of course if they I (35:32 - 35:39)
don&#39;t again I don&#39;t I don&#39;t remember (35:36 - 35:40)
everything because this was like three (35:39 - 35:42)
weeks ago and I don&#39;t remember what card (35:40 - 35:43)
they were looking for but there were (35:42 - 35:46)
there are some cards that are worth more (35:43 - 35:48)
than the $700 pack right like this (35:46 - 35:49)
card&#39;s worth a th000 this card&#39;s worth (35:48 - 35:52)
1,200 this card&#39;s worth 800 so there (35:49 - 35:58)
there&#39;s that gamble there but if you had (35:52 - 35:58)
I think this goes both ways right like (36:00 - 36:04)
if I had a pack of (36:01 - 36:08)
fossil and I spent $70 to scan it and I (36:04 - 36:10)
knew after the scan that there was (36:08 - 36:12)
nothing good in that pack what does a (36:10 - 36:15)
pack of fossil go for like 300 yeah 300 (36:12 - 36:16)
so I&#39;m (36:15 - 36:20)
then spending $70 to then go sell it to (36:16 - 36:23)
somebody else so there knowing that it&#39;s (36:20 - 36:26)
bad yes there&#39;s a couple things here to (36:23 - 36:27)
that though hold on there&#39;s there&#39;s a (36:26 - 36:30)
couple factors into what happens in so (36:27 - 36:33)
this person paid like a lot of money for (36:30 - 36:36)
this x-ray machine like I&#39;m on eBay (36:33 - 36:37)
right now looking at x-ray machines and (36:36 - 36:40)
they are thousands of (36:37 - 36:43)
dollars yeah so there there&#39;s a couple (36:40 - 36:44)
things that that happen that would have (36:43 - 36:47)
to happen here (36:44 - 36:49)
the you&#39;re not going to be able to buy a (36:47 - 36:52)
pack of cards and scan it before you buy (36:49 - 36:54)
it right so like you&#39;re going to end up (36:52 - 36:57)
buying that $700 pack of cards whatever (36:54 - 37:00)
first so it let&#39;s say you buy we&#39;ll (36:57 - 37:03)
we&#39;ll go with um I know for a fact like (37:00 - 37:05)
base set just a base set pack not first (37:03 - 37:07)
edition or anything just an unlimited (37:05 - 37:09)
base set pack uh typically runs around (37:07 - 37:12)
$600 or $700 or at least they were last (37:09 - 37:15)
year um (37:12 - 37:17)
and so let&#39;s say you spend that 700 on a (37:15 - 37:20)
Bas set pack and now you go and let&#39;s (37:17 - 37:22)
say you didn&#39;t know if it was weighted (37:20 - 37:24)
or not or if it you know so you get it (37:22 - 37:26)
and you go and you pay $70 to this (37:24 - 37:29)
person he looks at it (37:26 - 37:31)
in there there is a a holographic (37:29 - 37:33)
Charizard cool you&#39;re going to open that (37:31 - 37:34)
up and you&#39;re going to pull that (37:33 - 37:36)
holographic Charizard and you&#39;re going (37:34 - 37:38)
to go sell it or try to grade it for (37:36 - 37:40)
thousands of dollars right it worth (37:38 - 37:41)
thousands of dollars well let&#39;s say (37:40 - 37:44)
there&#39;s not a holographic in there well (37:41 - 37:46)
now you as a person are deciding whether (37:44 - 37:48)
you&#39;re going to (37:46 - 37:52)
knowingly give somebody a pack of cards (37:48 - 37:56)
that is no good at a price that is way (37:52 - 37:58)
over inflated for that pack of cards (37:56 - 37:59)
because you know that the card in the (37:58 - 38:01)
holographic is either not there or (37:59 - 38:04)
whatever so (38:01 - 38:06)
like you you kind of got to be a bad (38:04 - 38:10)
person here yeah I mean there is ethics (38:06 - 38:13)
involved of I that&#39;s already happening (38:10 - 38:18)
though like I I would not buy Cards I (38:13 - 38:21)
would normally not buy booster packs (38:18 - 38:23)
from card shops (38:21 - 38:26)
because there&#39;s not a doubt in my mind (38:23 - 38:28)
that some card shops aren&#39;t (38:26 - 38:31)
opening thousands of booster packs of a (38:28 - 38:34)
new set and then weighing the ones they (38:31 - 38:37)
don&#39;t open and putting the lighter ones (38:34 - 38:39)
out front for customers to buy like in (38:37 - 38:41)
like vintage packs I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s (38:39 - 38:42)
definitely hard not vintage like like (38:41 - 38:44)
well it&#39;s harder with the newer packs to (38:42 - 38:46)
do that you can still weigh them like (38:44 - 38:48)
there are many videos that show that the (38:46 - 38:50)
weight is different especially since (38:48 - 38:53)
they uh since the Scarlet Violet era (38:50 - 38:54)
where they they don&#39;t have different (38:53 - 38:58)
code cards for each one anymore yeah um (38:54 - 39:00)
so the code cards used to off weight the (38:58 - 39:01)
packs so you couldn&#39;t weigh them and (39:00 - 39:03)
then they changed that out and now you (39:01 - 39:06)
can sort of weigh them again but uh yeah (39:03 - 39:08)
with vintage packs that&#39;s the thing is (39:06 - 39:10)
like if they weighed them and then saw (39:08 - 39:12)
that they were lighter and then still (39:10 - 39:14)
sold them to (39:12 - 39:16)
people you wouldn&#39;t know that right so (39:14 - 39:17)
that&#39;s already a thing that can happen (39:16 - 39:19)
if and to be to be fair that could (39:17 - 39:21)
happen at Target right somebody could go (39:19 - 39:24)
into Target sit down there with a scale (39:21 - 39:25)
and start weighing packs and then put (39:24 - 39:27)
the lighter ones back on the shelf and (39:25 - 39:29)
then go to check out with like here&#39;s (39:27 - 39:32)
the 10 heavier ones I I got yes people (39:29 - 39:34)
have I&#39;ve actually seen reports of (39:32 - 39:36)
people being in Target taking pictures (39:34 - 39:38)
of people who have a scale like this was (39:36 - 39:42)
back in like the 2021 when I remember (39:38 - 39:44)
the big wave right like yeah taking (39:42 - 39:46)
pictures of people who are holding a (39:44 - 39:48)
scale and actually weigh trying to weigh (39:46 - 39:51)
packs in Target um so the funny thing (39:48 - 39:55)
about this article and uh this dude with (39:51 - 40:00)
a CT scanner is is there was another guy (39:55 - 40:04)
who also did the same thing but uh the (40:00 - 40:08)
Aaron Wayne was the one who like (40:04 - 40:11)
finalized and got that done (40:08 - 40:14)
first so I think the other (40:11 - 40:17)
person um was like more of like a (40:14 - 40:19)
company like I think a card shop bought (40:17 - 40:21)
a scanner and they were trying to do it (40:19 - 40:24)
so like two people had the same concept (40:21 - 40:28)
of what if we bought a scanner to see (40:24 - 40:30)
inside packs of cards again it doesn&#39;t (40:28 - 40:31)
have to be Pokemon they can do this with (40:30 - 40:34)
magic they can do this with Yu-Gi-Oh and (40:31 - 40:36)
then (40:34 - 40:38)
ultimately I don&#39;t know if the other (40:36 - 40:40)
person finished it or not but once they (40:38 - 40:42)
do finish it because obviously Aaron (40:40 - 40:44)
finished (40:42 - 40:46)
it they&#39;re going to then just start (40:44 - 40:49)
charging people money to (40:46 - 40:51)
scan and I (40:49 - 40:54)
think that you&#39;re going to see like (40:51 - 40:57)
these card parties still happen or I (40:54 - 40:59)
mean like whatever like TCG events have (40:57 - 41:01)
had been happening for 30 some years (40:59 - 41:03)
more than that right like I remember (41:01 - 41:06)
being 10 years old going to uh like a (41:03 - 41:08)
bingo hall where there was just people (41:06 - 41:11)
selling Pokemon cards and and magic and (41:08 - 41:13)
baseball and stuff like they&#39;ve existed (41:11 - 41:16)
forever but I think that you&#39;re going to (41:13 - 41:19)
see people who are full-time attending (41:16 - 41:21)
these events and that have all these (41:19 - 41:24)
vintage I think they are going to start (41:21 - 41:28)
sending packs over for $70 (41:24 - 41:29)
and then (41:28 - 41:32)
just sell them (41:29 - 41:35)
knowing that they&#39;re not (41:32 - 41:38)
good like they they know for $70 there&#39;s (41:35 - 41:40)
nothing in here but they don&#39;t have to (41:38 - 41:44)
tell you that right right yeah I I think (41:40 - 41:46)
it&#39;s kind of like one of those things (41:44 - 41:49)
where right at this moment it&#39;s not that (41:46 - 41:51)
big of a deal like it&#39;s not happening (41:49 - 41:53)
widely in any way right there&#39;s only one (41:51 - 41:55)
dude doing it one person that&#39;s done it (41:53 - 41:57)
or two people but that idea is now out (41:55 - 42:00)
out there like that concept is now out (41:57 - 42:03)
there that it hasn&#39;t been maybe it&#39;s (42:00 - 42:04)
been thought of before I&#39;m sure it has (42:03 - 42:07)
but not to the point where someone&#39;s (42:04 - 42:09)
really got it working and now people are (42:07 - 42:12)
reporting on it and now that idea is (42:09 - 42:14)
there and if you&#39;re a vintage collector (42:12 - 42:17)
or a sealed collection (42:14 - 42:20)
collector and you have this opportunity (42:17 - 42:23)
I mean people keep their stuff sealed so (42:20 - 42:25)
that they can sell it at a higher price (42:23 - 42:27)
down the road and now you have (42:25 - 42:28)
opportunity (42:27 - 42:30)
I keep my stuff sealed because I forget (42:28 - 42:34)
I bought it and then I then I (42:30 - 42:36)
forgot here&#39;s the thing like there was (42:34 - 42:38)
there&#39;s always (42:36 - 42:40)
something like when you were just (42:38 - 42:41)
selling sealed packs and you didn&#39;t know (42:40 - 42:44)
what it is and there&#39;s always posible (42:41 - 42:46)
deniability I don&#39;t know what it is I (42:44 - 42:48)
didn&#39;t open it could be good could be (42:46 - 42:51)
bad you&#39;re assuming that risk at this (42:48 - 42:54)
point plausible deniability will go out (42:51 - 42:57)
the window if this becomes huge and at (42:54 - 42:59)
that point (42:57 - 42:59)
we are in we are in weird ethics land (43:00 - 43:06)
where like a shop could say we won&#39;t pay (43:03 - 43:09)
to have these scanned it&#39;s (43:06 - 43:12)
still you know it&#39;s still you assume the (43:09 - 43:13)
risk but we have no idea what they (43:12 - 43:16)
actually did right right like we are (43:13 - 43:18)
already (43:16 - 43:22)
trusting a lot of people to be mostly (43:18 - 43:26)
honest with how they do things based on (43:22 - 43:28)
not a lot based on the fact that we need (43:26 - 43:30)
to keep Society going this sort of like (43:28 - 43:34)
takes us a step away from that across (43:30 - 43:36)
the board which is (43:34 - 43:40)
not great like cool that you did it not (43:36 - 43:41)
great that you&#39;re like and then to (43:40 - 43:44)
recope my thousands of dollars (43:41 - 43:49)
I&#39;ll prove people are lying for $70 like (43:44 - 43:50)
yeah or I&#39;ll let you know that you got (43:49 - 43:53)
ripped off with no recourse cuz you (43:50 - 43:55)
bought it assuming the risk like if you (43:53 - 43:57)
opened it if you had it scanned it at (43:55 - 44:00)
that point all the difference is that (43:57 - 44:03)
you are then knowing it&#39;s a bad pack (44:00 - 44:05)
willingly scamming the next person that (44:03 - 44:07)
you&#39;re selling it to you&#39;re willingly (44:05 - 44:09)
lying that you don&#39;t know what&#39;s in (44:07 - 44:11)
there and saying well buy it for me it (44:09 - 44:13)
could have something good and you are (44:11 - 44:15)
full disclosure no there&#39;s nothing good (44:13 - 44:20)
in there right yeah well I think it (44:15 - 44:24)
also go ahead I I think it also what (44:20 - 44:25)
will end up happening is if this (44:24 - 44:28)
actually does grow in (44:25 - 44:30)
some meaningful (44:28 - 44:34)
way you will just see the value of these (44:30 - 44:36)
things go down because people will be (44:34 - 44:38)
more potentially be a little bit more (44:36 - 44:42)
afraid to spend the money on packs like (44:38 - 44:45)
that which will in turn make the prices (44:42 - 44:46)
have to drop so that they people can (44:45 - 44:48)
sell them for more than what they bought (44:46 - 44:49)
them for you know that you know how it (44:48 - 44:52)
all works so it will just drive all the (44:49 - 44:54)
prices down uh (44:52 - 44:56)
which some may think is actually a good (44:54 - 45:00)
thing yeah the price is down that that (44:56 - 45:02)
could be a good thing to some people (45:00 - 45:03)
right (45:02 - 45:06)
like again when I&#39;m when I unfortunately (45:03 - 45:09)
make it to TCG Tik Tock and you see (45:06 - 45:11)
these people that are like wheeling and (45:09 - 45:14)
dealing and like yeah watching a person (45:11 - 45:16)
casually walk into like a convention and (45:14 - 45:18)
being like I&#39;ll take that PSA 10 Moon (45:16 - 45:20)
Brion for (45:18 - 45:23)
$1,200 and you&#39;re just (45:20 - 45:27)
like not what I would spend $1,200 on (45:23 - 45:29)
all right and I&#39;ve bought some pretty (45:27 - 45:31)
dumb stuff over the years I have I have (45:29 - 45:33)
a moon Bon I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve said this (45:31 - 45:35)
story on here I have a moon Bon story (45:33 - 45:37)
that still haunts me to this day that is (45:35 - 45:40)
like that card is just an exception (45:37 - 45:43)
right to like the rest of like that era (45:40 - 45:44)
of cards it&#39;s a sword and shield ARA (45:43 - 45:47)
right there&#39;s a alternate art Umbreon (45:44 - 45:49)
it&#39;s reaching for the moon and it was (45:47 - 45:52)
worth like 200 bucks when it first when (45:49 - 45:54)
evolving Skies first came out and my (45:52 - 45:56)
friend was in a card shop he lives in (45:54 - 45:57)
North Carolina and he was in a card shop (45:56 - 45:59)
and they were selling it for (45:57 - 46:01)
$250 and he texted me kind of jokingly (45:59 - 46:04)
like if you venmo me $250 right now I&#39;ll (46:01 - 46:06)
buy this card and I&#39;ll ship it to you (46:04 - 46:08)
and I really wanted it but I was like no (46:06 - 46:10)
like every other alternate art they&#39;re (46:08 - 46:12)
going to come down in price a little bit (46:10 - 46:14)
and I&#39;ll just wait till it drops at (46:12 - 46:17)
least under 200 like I&#39;ll just wait and (46:14 - 46:19)
I&#39;ll just wait and it&#39;s now like $1,000 (46:17 - 46:22)
doll ungraded to buy that card today and (46:19 - 46:24)
I just kick myself every time I go look (46:22 - 46:27)
and see that it&#39;s gone up again and well (46:24 - 46:31)
another gamble in this industry (46:27 - 46:34)
is am I going to send this Moon Bon or (46:31 - 46:37)
Charizard or Mewtwo off to PSA and are (46:34 - 46:39)
they going to give it a 10 or are they (46:37 - 46:41)
going to give it a nine and if they give (46:39 - 46:44)
it a nine I&#39;m going to then take app (46:41 - 46:45)
pliers and crack it open and then I&#39;m (46:44 - 46:49)
going to send it back again Y and hope (46:45 - 46:52)
for a 10 because there&#39;s such a price (46:49 - 46:54)
difference between a nine and a 10 you (46:52 - 46:56)
also will see some people send it to (46:54 - 46:58)
like what is it CG (46:56 - 47:00)
and be like oh well cgc gave it a (46:58 - 47:03)
9.5 so I&#39;m going to crack that open and (47:00 - 47:06)
now I feel better to send it to PSA I (47:03 - 47:08)
think I think cgc does point point FES (47:06 - 47:11)
and stuff yes I I legitimately in my (47:08 - 47:15)
basement have so many unopened Pokemon (47:11 - 47:18)
cards because I would buy them to just (47:15 - 47:20)
like open on stream for like fun like (47:18 - 47:22)
fun like break up the content and stuff (47:20 - 47:24)
of like ah we&#39;ve been like shiny hunting (47:22 - 47:25)
or we&#39;ve been battling for like an hour (47:24 - 47:26)
straight let&#39;s like take a 5 minute (47:25 - 47:28)
break and open up like five packs of (47:26 - 47:30)
cards right uh and I genuinely like (47:28 - 47:34)
collecting cards I still have a box a (47:30 - 47:39)
booster box 30 36 packs of XY Evolutions (47:34 - 47:41)
unopened and I&#39;m looking at eBay and (47:39 - 47:43)
it&#39;s it&#39;s $820 (47:41 - 47:46)
$775 (47:43 - 47:46)
$825 okay that&#39;s wild because you know (47:48 - 47:53)
the thing that is you know what&#39;s true (47:52 - 47:56)
about XY Evolutions if you buy every one (47:53 - 47:58)
of those cards as single cards you can (47:56 - 48:00)
buy that entire set for less than (47:58 - 48:03)
$500 yeah every booster box which will (48:00 - 48:07)
only give you maybe 60% of that set less (48:03 - 48:10)
probably is like $1,000 or $800 like you (48:07 - 48:12)
said but you could literally go and buy (48:10 - 48:15)
every single card online right now for (48:12 - 48:18)
less than (48:15 - 48:18)
$500 it&#39;s I and to be clear here I I (48:19 - 48:25)
actually have never sold a card before (48:23 - 48:28)
like I am not in any of for money like I (48:25 - 48:30)
really truly do love collecting Pokemon (48:28 - 48:33)
cards but at the same time you are (48:30 - 48:35)
spending your money to do that like one (48:33 - 48:37)
way or the other money is involved I (48:35 - 48:38)
know a lot of people are like oh people (48:37 - 48:41)
turning the Cards into like just money (48:38 - 48:44)
money money but how are you getting the (48:41 - 48:46)
cards you have to spend your money to (48:44 - 48:48)
get the cards and so like these things (48:46 - 48:51)
are important when you look at the (48:48 - 48:53)
prices and where best to spend your (48:51 - 48:56)
money for this for this hobby right um (48:53 - 48:59)
so like it&#39;s the XY Evolutions it&#39;s like (48:56 - 49:01)
why why am I why would I open it what (48:59 - 49:03)
would I what would I be looking (49:01 - 49:05)
for like if there was a if there was a (49:03 - 49:07)
single card in XY Evolutions that I (49:05 - 49:09)
wanted I would just go to TCG player (49:07 - 49:12)
type it in and just buy it so it&#39;s like (49:09 - 49:16)
this thing that I have in my basement in (49:12 - 49:18)
a tote with a bunch of other unopened (49:16 - 49:20)
packs is about (49:18 - 49:26)
$800 give or take right and so do I sell (49:20 - 49:30)
it as 8 $100 to somebody or do I keep (49:26 - 49:33)
sitting on it does it go up does it go (49:30 - 49:36)
down like it just it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of why (49:33 - 49:38)
I keep a lot of stuff sealed and that (49:36 - 49:39)
because like I&#39;m (49:38 - 49:42)
hoping I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s going to go up in (49:39 - 49:43)
the future it&#39;s like I legitimately (49:42 - 49:46)
don&#39;t know what to do with it (49:43 - 49:50)
um and like maybe in 10 years I&#39;ll be (49:46 - 49:51)
like you know it&#39; be really cool let&#39;s (49:50 - 49:55)
open let&#39;s crack that box open but it (49:51 - 49:59)
would purely be for fun M the fun of (49:55 - 50:02)
opening packs (49:59 - 50:04)
which is genuinely fun I think people (50:02 - 50:06)
like to buy Pokemon packs because (50:04 - 50:07)
they&#39;re fun to open and it&#39;s like what&#39;s (50:06 - 50:10)
in there (50:07 - 50:14)
um or maybe I I contct this guy I think (50:10 - 50:17)
he&#39;ll do a booster box for like (50:14 - 50:19)
125 and you see if a Charizard&#39;s in (50:17 - 50:22)
there yeah see if the Charizards in (50:19 - 50:25)
there yeah uh I think the the the best (50:22 - 50:28)
thing to do when it comes to just (50:25 - 50:30)
collecting it&#39;s just collect what you (50:28 - 50:32)
like if you like opening packs open (50:30 - 50:34)
packs if you like uh if you have (50:32 - 50:36)
specific cards from a set that you like (50:34 - 50:38)
maybe go check your local shop or you (50:36 - 50:40)
know like an online spot that&#39;s (50:38 - 50:43)
trustworthy uh for purchasing singles (50:40 - 50:45)
you know like just just collect what you (50:43 - 50:48)
like and um you know if you like sealed (50:45 - 50:50)
if you like to keep things sealed and I (50:48 - 50:52)
that&#39;s not to say there are people who (50:50 - 50:54)
don&#39;t like who aren&#39;t just trying to (50:52 - 50:55)
make a buck by keeping things sealed (50:54 - 50:57)
some people want to collect things and (50:55 - 50:59)
keep them sealed and do that that&#39;s true (50:57 - 51:00)
I&#39;ve seen people just collect every (50:59 - 51:03)
single ETB and they they just like (51:00 - 51:05)
collecting kind of cool actually when (51:03 - 51:06)
you collect them all and you have them (51:05 - 51:08)
all right (51:06 - 51:10)
behind there you go guys got one got one (51:08 - 51:14)
one down I uh I don&#39;t think this will be (51:10 - 51:16)
the last time we hear about this TCG (51:14 - 51:19)
scanner I think that no once once the (51:16 - 51:22)
other person finishes and once more and (51:19 - 51:22)
more (51:22 - 51:25)
people hear of this and start sending (51:22 - 51:28)
stuff in I think that (51:25 - 51:29)
we will definitely have another (51:28 - 51:31)
conversation before the end of the year (51:29 - 51:33)
about this you don&#39;t have to have a lot (51:31 - 51:35)
of people who decide to go and get a (51:33 - 51:36)
scanner you know I mean they&#39;re saying (51:35 - 51:39)
like oh this is an expensive thing to do (51:36 - 51:41)
but it&#39;s not like you have to have (51:39 - 51:42)
thousands of people going and buying (51:41 - 51:46)
them like you just have to have I think (51:42 - 51:48)
once this catches on to I think this guy (51:46 - 51:51)
is set I think he will recoup his cost (51:48 - 51:54)
and I think he will he will make money (51:51 - 51:57)
cuz again it baseball cards magic (51:54 - 52:01)
Yu-Gi-Oh mhm whatever (51:57 - 52:05)
like like on on an entrepreneur (52:01 - 52:08)
level good for that guy (52:05 - 52:13)
like to like no Steve I think I I am (52:08 - 52:15)
actually shocked that (52:13 - 52:20)
like it is 2024 and we&#39;re talking about (52:15 - 52:22)
scanning booster packs you would have (52:20 - 52:24)
thought that this would have been (52:22 - 52:28)
like happening like 10 years ago (52:24 - 52:32)
mhm I I guess it could have they just or (52:28 - 52:34)
maybe the technology for what they like (52:32 - 52:35)
are doing with it wasn&#39;t there with (52:34 - 52:38)
scanners then or something I don&#39;t like (52:35 - 52:41)
I don&#39;t know enough about uh CT scanners (52:38 - 52:44)
to understand like how far the (52:41 - 52:46)
technology has come I didn&#39;t even know (52:44 - 52:48)
you could buy one off eBay 10 years oh (52:46 - 52:50)
yeah I think there&#39;s a lot of things (52:48 - 52:52)
that factor into it one a lot of these (52:50 - 52:53)
products were never sold on the (52:52 - 52:56)
secondhand Market because they were kept (52:53 - 52:59)
in hospital and you would keep them in a (52:56 - 53:02)
hospital forever and then as our (52:59 - 53:04)
healthare got worse and more private (53:02 - 53:06)
practices had to pick these things up (53:04 - 53:08)
and more companies were like let&#39;s sell (53:06 - 53:10)
it to a chiropractor who doesn&#39;t have (53:08 - 53:11)
need but we&#39;ll convince them that they (53:10 - 53:14)
do and then they discover oh we&#39;ll we (53:11 - 53:16)
never use this we just invested (53:14 - 53:18)
thousands of dollars so let&#39;s sell it on (53:16 - 53:20)
eBay to try to recoup our costs like a (53:18 - 53:22)
lot of those things are just becoming (53:20 - 53:24)
available on the market where they (53:22 - 53:28)
weren&#39;t before and also like (53:24 - 53:28)
a lot of things you couldn&#39;t sell on (53:29 - 53:32)
eBay before and a lot of those (53:30 - 53:35)
restrictions are gone a lot of the a lot (53:32 - 53:37)
of the rules that used to prevent these (53:35 - 53:39)
things from happening are no longer in (53:37 - 53:43)
existence for a wide variety of reasons (53:39 - 53:46)
yeah uh speaking of rules this is off (53:43 - 53:49)
Nintendo life new Pokemon Snap is the (53:46 - 53:52)
first official Pokemon release in China (53:49 - 53:54)
since (53:52 - 53:57)
2000 I had to (53:54 - 54:01)
reread this headline and then furiously (53:57 - 54:05)
like look up of how true or not true (54:01 - 54:07)
this (54:05 - 54:09)
is (54:07 - 54:12)
uh so new Pokemon Snap is officially (54:09 - 54:15)
released in China on July 16th (54:12 - 54:18)
2024 this is the first Pokemon game (54:15 - 54:20)
officially released in China after the (54:18 - 54:24)
console band in 2000 let&#39;s go Pikachu (54:20 - 54:26)
and let&#39;s go Eevee are preparing for (54:24 - 54:28)
release (54:26 - 54:28)
release and for (54:29 - 54:36)
specifically new Pokemon Snap they did (54:32 - 54:39)
change the way the sun looked in the (54:36 - 54:42)
game the like little Sun (54:39 - 54:46)
icon uh and the account reporting on (54:42 - 54:51)
this said that the sun was (54:46 - 54:54)
too resembl too much of (54:51 - 54:58)
Taiwan so that&#39;s why it was changed (54:54 - 55:01)
uh does it now you&#39;re like though this (54:58 - 55:02)
doesn&#39;t make any sense there&#39;s a bunch (55:01 - 55:05)
of people in China playing Pokemon games (55:02 - 55:06)
that&#39;s (55:05 - 55:08)
true that&#39;s why I had to look it up all (55:06 - 55:12)
of that stuff was imported so Nothing is (55:08 - 55:14)
Stopping a (55:12 - 55:18)
store or a a reseller or anyone going (55:14 - 55:20)
online and (55:18 - 55:24)
buying the Japanese copy or the English (55:20 - 55:27)
copy or the (55:24 - 55:31)
Taiwanese copy so it&#39;s not that they (55:27 - 55:32)
couldn&#39;t (55:31 - 55:36)
sell Pokemon games (55:32 - 55:40)
yeah it&#39;s (55:36 - 55:40)
that this is an official Chinese release (55:41 - 55:48)
of this version where I&#39;m pretty sure (55:46 - 55:51)
like there&#39;s traditional and simplified (55:48 - 55:53)
Chinese in like scarlet and violet right (55:51 - 55:54)
like they made a big deal about that (55:53 - 55:57)
around was it sun and moon I think (55:54 - 56:00)
sun and moon I believe added two Chinese (55:57 - 56:02)
languages (56:00 - 56:06)
yeah um so all you would have to do is (56:02 - 56:08)
we go to Hong Kong walk into whatever (56:06 - 56:12)
their version of GameStop is buy a used (56:08 - 56:16)
copy of Japanese Pokemon Sun start the (56:12 - 56:19)
game up pick traditional Chinese and now (56:16 - 56:22)
you can play the whole game just (56:19 - 56:23)
fine (56:22 - 56:27)
uh kind of cool (56:23 - 56:27)
kind of weird to think about yeah yeah (56:29 - 56:35)
yeah well it because it was making me (56:32 - 56:36)
think (56:35 - 56:40)
about uh so is this specific to console (56:36 - 56:42)
games because didn&#39;t they made like an (56:40 - 56:46)
entire version of Pokemon Quest on (56:42 - 56:49)
mobile for China right like the Pokemon (56:46 - 56:52)
quest in China has like a they have gen (56:49 - 56:56)
two physical releases okay physical (56:52 - 56:59)
release of new Pokemon Snap I believe in (56:56 - 57:01)
China you could go in and get a digital (56:59 - 57:04)
release of it yeah cuz there&#39;s a (57:01 - 57:06)
different version of unite in China too (57:04 - 57:09)
yes okay phys thank you for bringing (57:06 - 57:11)
that up I yeah that that was what I had (57:09 - 57:14)
to mention too so I don&#39;t think this (57:11 - 57:16)
means that like new Pokemon Snap is all (57:14 - 57:18)
of a sudden going to sell like a million (57:16 - 57:20)
copies I think when let&#39;s go Pikachu (57:18 - 57:21)
let&#39;s go Eevee eventually comes out (57:20 - 57:23)
which is supposed to be later this year (57:21 - 57:25)
I don&#39;t think that means like let&#39;s go (57:23 - 57:26)
Pikachu let&#39;s go eeve is going to sell (57:25 - 57:28)
like a ion copies because there have (57:26 - 57:32)
been multiple ways in China to get those (57:28 - 57:34)
games right also you could just do what (57:32 - 57:36)
the English players do and just switch (57:34 - 57:39)
your game your store to Australia and (57:36 - 57:42)
now you got Pokemon Legends 12 hours (57:39 - 57:45)
early yeah well but could can you do (57:42 - 57:47)
that in China I mean there are so many (57:45 - 57:48)
different regulations on like the (57:47 - 57:50)
internet in China are you able to do (57:48 - 57:51)
that in China the same way you can in (57:50 - 57:54)
the US I believe yes from what I was (57:51 - 57:56)
looking up I believe that I I was (57:54 - 57:57)
reading that (57:56 - 57:59)
if somebody in China wanted a different (57:57 - 58:00)
game they would just switch their stores (57:59 - 58:03)
okay or they would just go to a shop and (58:00 - 58:05)
get the import there are a lot of (58:03 - 58:07)
restrictions and whenever there are a (58:05 - 58:09)
lot of restrictions there&#39;s a lot of (58:07 - 58:10)
people who know how to get around those (58:09 - 58:13)
restrictions I mean for as much as they (58:10 - 58:16)
like to crack down on stuff there (58:13 - 58:21)
are I mean vpns exist everywhere like (58:16 - 58:23)
there there are a lot of ways they&#39;ve (58:21 - 58:26)
gotten around it it it is it is a lot of (58:23 - 58:28)
show and also it&#39;s a thing that catches (58:26 - 58:31)
a lot of business people offu because (58:28 - 58:34)
they aren&#39;t prepared to be like why (58:31 - 58:36)
can&#39;t I get most things on my internet (58:34 - 58:37)
because they just didn&#39;t do the research (58:36 - 58:40)
and did the work to to get a more free (58:37 - 58:43)
internet is also a money thing a lot of (58:40 - 58:44)
the things cost money so like their (58:43 - 58:46)
General populace probably just doesn&#39;t (58:44 - 58:48)
don&#39;t see it worth to afford it but (58:46 - 58:52)
anybody who has money enough to buy (58:48 - 58:54)
extra games probably knows how to get (58:52 - 58:56)
around it right well you know if you (58:54 - 58:59)
have extra money there&#39;s a $90 calendar (58:56 - 59:02)
app you can get $50 Pokemon sleep I hear (58:59 - 59:04)
eBay is selling CT machines right now so (59:02 - 59:08)
for the low low price of (59:04 - 59:08)
$4,000 that dude is gonna make his money (59:08 - 59:14)
back so fast if all he spent was $4,000 (59:11 - 59:16)
on a CT (59:14 - 59:16)
machine that&#39;s crazy that there&#39;s no (59:16 - 59:22)
problem for that for (59:19 - 59:22)

areh (60:37 - 60:41)
um standard standard Community Day (60:39 - 60:43)
standard stuff isn&#39;t there a Community (60:41 - 60:45)
Day (60:43 - 60:47)
happening during the World Championship (60:45 - 60:50)
it&#39;s a classic though yeah the classic (60:47 - 60:52)
is happening during that isn&#39;t it yes (60:50 - 60:55)
but I think it&#39;s happening on Saturday (60:52 - 60:57)
which was better than last year where (60:55 - 60:58)
they decided to put (60:57 - 61:03)
Froakie during the actual finals (60:58 - 61:06)
yeah which (61:03 - 61:06)
was H how does anyone make that decision (61:07 - 61:14)
Janine in the calendar man don&#39;t (61:12 - 61:16)
question it just go they need a $90 (61:14 - 61:18)
calendar (61:16 - 61:22)
app to figure out not to overlap that (61:18 - 61:24)
did they they they didn&#39;t announce what (61:22 - 61:25)
classic was though yeah I&#39;m looking at (61:24 - 61:27)
it I don&#39;t (61:25 - 61:30)
see uh I don&#39;t see an announcement for (61:27 - 61:32)
it I don&#39;t even know what classic would (61:30 - 61:35)
be (61:32 - 61:35)
exciting (61:35 - 61:41)
um could be I&#39;m just looking at a Reddit (61:37 - 61:42)
post where someone is saying they&#39;re (61:41 - 61:44)
hoping for either something like Ralts (61:42 - 61:48)
or Beldum those will both be good yeah I (61:44 - 61:49)
think Beldum would maybe make the most (61:48 - 61:52)
sense if if eventually you get (61:49 - 61:56)
Mega Metagross eventually and Ralts we a (61:52 - 61:59)
g galade hasn&#39;t come out yet either so (61:56 - 62:02)
oh yeah that&#39;s true no galade both those (61:59 - 62:05)
would would be (62:02 - 62:09)
good yeah I guess I don&#39;t know I like (62:05 - 62:10)
there is probably something exciting (62:09 - 62:12)
that I&#39;m not thinking of but I&#39;ve also (62:10 - 62:14)
participated in every single Community (62:12 - 62:17)
Day so yeah I&#39;ll be in Atlanta so if (62:14 - 62:19)
people are at Dragon Con doing that let (62:17 - 62:21)
me know where you&#39;re (62:19 - 62:24)
at yeah so Beldum would be fun let&#39;s (62:21 - 62:26)
let&#39;s let&#39;s hope for Beldum okay perfect (62:24 - 62:30)
there you go yeah metag girl is cool (62:26 - 62:32)
done uh I said last week that we we will (62:30 - 62:35)
probably get Safari Zone stuff we got (62:32 - 62:38)
Safari Zone (62:35 - 62:43)
stuff we only got two Safari zones not (62:38 - 62:47)
three so I&#39;m not sure (62:43 - 62:51)
if I have no Insider info I know that (62:47 - 62:54)
sometimes I have meetings with Niantic I (62:51 - 62:58)
will tell you that (62:54 - 62:58)
I I don&#39;t know (62:59 - 63:01)
anything I genuinely don&#39;t know anything (63:02 - 63:07)
I was guessing that the Safari Zone (63:05 - 63:08)
stuff would be announced just because (63:07 - 63:09)
this is about the same time they (63:08 - 63:11)
announced it last year they waited until (63:09 - 63:15)
go Fest was completely over (63:11 - 63:19)
um I would guess that they were probably (63:15 - 63:21)
again I this is just pure (63:19 - 63:23)
speculation uh I would guess that there (63:21 - 63:24)
was probably more (63:23 - 63:27)
locations but it&#39;s so easy for some some (63:24 - 63:30)
of the stuff to just like fall through (63:27 - 63:32)
where they couldn&#39;t get the terms in (63:30 - 63:35)
agreement right they couldn&#39;t decide on (63:32 - 63:38)
money the venue was being too difficult (63:35 - 63:42)
I don&#39;t know why there&#39;s not (63:38 - 63:45)
three from the the The Insider (63:42 - 63:47)
information I do know which isn&#39;t even (63:45 - 63:48)
Insider information Niantic has said (63:47 - 63:51)
this publicly they love their Live (63:48 - 63:53)
Events they wish they could do more so I (63:51 - 63:55)
don&#39;t know why they I don&#39;t think this (63:53 - 63:58)
is like oh they&#39;re scaling back uh I&#39;m (63:55 - 64:00)
I&#39;m assuming whatever the Third location (63:58 - 64:03)
was something went wrong has there (64:00 - 64:07)
always been three locations for Safari (64:03 - 64:10)
Zone I know initially even before Co (64:07 - 64:12)
they announced three it was what like it (64:10 - 64:13)
was St (64:12 - 64:16)
Louis Canada and then what was it like (64:13 - 64:18)
Pittsburgh weren&#39;t the initial Safari (64:16 - 64:21)
zones though like an addition to go Fest (64:18 - 64:23)
so it was like go Fest and then when (64:21 - 64:25)
there were two Safari zones in addition (64:23 - 64:27)
to go Fest is what I thought how it (64:25 - 64:29)
initially went think the very first (64:27 - 64:32)
Safari Zone ever was like Germany yeah (64:29 - 64:35)
and then there was one in like Japan and (64:32 - 64:36)
it was like so it was like go Fest in (64:35 - 64:39)
Chicago and then two Safari zones oh (64:36 - 64:41)
addition to go Fest and then they&#39;ve (64:39 - 64:44)
slowly changed it over the years to be (64:41 - 64:48)
three to be whatever this is now right (64:44 - 64:53)
right but but even so there&#39;s (64:48 - 64:56)
like these are different so one is (64:53 - 64:59)
Pokémon go City Safari and the other one (64:56 - 65:03)
is Pokémon go Safari (64:59 - 65:03)
Zone they really make this very easy to (65:04 - 65:11)
follow anyways this is what they ended (65:08 - 65:14)
up announcing uh so Pokemon go City (65:11 - 65:17)
Safari Jakarta which will take place (65:14 - 65:21)
from uh September 21st to September 22nd (65:17 - 65:23)
and that is a part of Pikachu&#39;s (65:21 - 65:26)
Indonesia Journey which (65:23 - 65:30)
they&#39;ve done twice so far I believe and (65:26 - 65:32)
if I remember (65:30 - 65:36)
correctly both pachu Indonesia Journeys (65:32 - 65:40)
that have already happened involved a 5K (65:36 - 65:44)
race that you could do where if you ran (65:40 - 65:46)
that (65:44 - 65:48)
race is is that what they call it a race (65:46 - 65:51)
Marathon not a marathon that&#39;s 26.2 (65:48 - 65:54)
miles uh you would then get like a medal (65:51 - 65:57)
at the end as long as you finished (65:54 - 65:58)
that&#39;s cool and the metal had like (65:57 - 66:00)
Pikachu on it like an actual like metal (65:58 - 66:02)
metal like a race metal not like an (66:00 - 66:04)
in-game metal not an in-game metal (66:02 - 66:08)
actual physical object yes uh you&#39;ll (66:04 - 66:10)
encounter Pokemon around the Pokemon air (66:08 - 66:13)
Adventures such as flying Pikachu tropus (66:10 - 66:15)
Noibat so these are the same Pikachus (66:13 - 66:18)
that have been the Bali Pikachu that has (66:15 - 66:20)
been in the in Indonesia if it&#39;s your (66:18 - 66:22)
first time in Jakarta you&#39;ll have an (66:20 - 66:24)
exclusive chance to encounter skadoo (66:22 - 66:26)
while you set off for a Citywide (66:24 - 66:29)
adventure to discover stores new friends (66:26 - 66:31)
and exciting Pokemon waiting for you in (66:29 - 66:33)
the city whether you are a firsttime (66:31 - 66:37)
city goer uh your Pokemon go City Safari (66:33 - 66:39)
will take you across the city in a new (66:37 - 66:41)
way from historic landmarks to local (66:39 - 66:43)
favorites get ready to taste the city (66:41 - 66:46)
with your Pokemon go on your side I (66:43 - 66:48)
think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s (66:46 - 66:53)
great I talked about so I went to the (66:48 - 66:54)
the the next Safari Zone we&#39;re about to (66:53 - 66:57)
talk about is Korea (66:54 - 66:59)
the first Safari Zone in Korea that I (66:57 - 67:02)
went to was in goyang and that was at a (66:59 - 67:05)
park in goyang and it (67:02 - 67:09)
was eight hours in this park (67:05 - 67:12)
and there wasn&#39;t a whole lot to do if (67:09 - 67:14)
you&#39;ve ever played community at a park (67:12 - 67:16)
at your local park for 3 hours you&#39;re (67:14 - 67:18)
probably slightly bored at the end of (67:16 - 67:20)
said three (67:18 - 67:22)
hours um imagine that for like eight (67:20 - 67:26)
hours for Safari Zone that&#39;s what it was (67:22 - 67:27)
was (67:26 - 67:30)
like it was obviously still a new city (67:27 - 67:32)
it was a big park there was photo (67:30 - 67:34)
opportunities and stuff like there there (67:32 - 67:37)
were things to do (67:34 - 67:39)
but even if you were to like go to like (67:37 - 67:42)
New York go Fest or any of the go Fest (67:39 - 67:43)
this past (67:42 - 67:46)
year being on Randall&#39;s Island for eight (67:43 - 67:49)
hours isn&#39;t like wouldn&#39;t have been (67:46 - 67:53)
amazing no it would not have been no uh (67:49 - 67:56)
so when they announced the second Safari (67:53 - 67:59)
Zone in Korea which was in Soul and they (67:56 - 68:01)
did this city experience Safari Zone it (67:59 - 68:04)
was a million times better and they set (68:01 - 68:06)
it up I remember coming on the podcast (68:04 - 68:08)
saying up they set it up in a way where (68:06 - 68:10)
they you like followed the flower Poké (68:08 - 68:12)
stops and it legitimately took you (68:10 - 68:15)
through soul to the things you would (68:12 - 68:17)
want to see if you were visiting Soul (68:15 - 68:19)
For the First Time like oh here&#39;s this (68:17 - 68:21)
Museum here&#39;s this huge statue here&#39;s (68:19 - 68:23)
this really famous Arch here&#39;s this (68:21 - 68:26)
touristy area with all the shops here (68:23 - 68:27)
all the restaurants that people go to (68:26 - 68:29)
like it was just (68:27 - 68:32)
fantastic and that was two days (68:29 - 68:35)
and I would assume that most people (68:32 - 68:36)
broke that up into sections because (68:35 - 68:39)
there was like three big areas to go to (68:36 - 68:40)
so I would assume that most people did (68:39 - 68:43)
maybe two of the areas on Saturday and (68:40 - 68:44)
then the third area on Sunday but (68:43 - 68:47)
regardless you could play anywhere in (68:44 - 68:50)
Soul and still have your spawns and your (68:47 - 68:53)
stops and stuff um whereas like the (68:50 - 68:56)
goyang thing was very you got to be be (68:53 - 68:57)
in this (68:56 - 69:01)
park uh so the Pokémon go City Safari (68:57 - 69:04)
Jakarta sounds exactly like what they&#39;re (69:01 - 69:07)
doing that they did in Soul which (69:04 - 69:11)
was we&#39;re curating an experience for you (69:07 - 69:13)
to explore the (69:11 - 69:17)
city in a good way and I I think um I I (69:13 - 69:18)
know a couple people in our community (69:17 - 69:20)
went to Barcelona and it sound like the (69:18 - 69:22)
Barcelona was very much (69:20 - 69:25)
curated to do the like I did the (69:22 - 69:27)
Barcelona thing cuz I went to Barcelona (69:25 - 69:29)
well after I was in Madrid and I it (69:27 - 69:31)
would have been nice to have like (69:29 - 69:34)
a the in-game map also help but like I (69:31 - 69:36)
had to like put it all in like Google (69:34 - 69:38)
Maps and do the touristy things because (69:36 - 69:40)
I was only in Barcelona for like 24 (69:38 - 69:43)
hours uh for Korea they announced uh (69:40 - 69:46)
inchon uh which is Friday September 27th (69:43 - 69:48)
through Sunday September 29th so the (69:46 - 69:51)
week after Jakarta that will be taking (69:48 - 69:56)
place in s sdo Central Park (69:51 - 69:59)
which does not sound like a city (69:56 - 70:01)
experience this is the second Safari (69:59 - 70:04)
Zone hosted in South Korea so yeah (70:01 - 70:06)
they&#39;re saying that this is the second (70:04 - 70:07)
Safari (70:06 - 70:12)
Zone because the one last year was a sa (70:07 - 70:14)
City (70:12 - 70:17)
Safari so it&#39;s very interesting that (70:14 - 70:20)
they&#39;re separating these two I just (70:17 - 70:22)
thought the city what wait what is it (70:20 - 70:26)
called the city Safari (70:22 - 70:29)
replace the Safari Zone because the city (70:26 - 70:32)
Safari is the better MH (70:29 - 70:35)
experience but I mean like even if you (70:32 - 70:37)
look at the two they&#39;re like different (70:35 - 70:39)
logos and everything you know it&#39;s like (70:37 - 70:41)
completely they&#39;re definitely different (70:39 - 70:44)
and I and I do wonder if it has to do (70:41 - 70:49)
with the city and what they&#39;re able to (70:44 - 70:53)
agree on with the specific City and for (70:49 - 70:54)
some it&#39;s like no we&#39;re only going to (70:53 - 70:56)
allow you to do this (70:54 - 70:59)
within a park and do it this way and so (70:56 - 71:01)
they have that be their Safari zones and (70:59 - 71:03)
then you have other cities that maybe (71:01 - 71:06)
allow for more will coordinate with (71:03 - 71:08)
doing something throughout the city and (71:06 - 71:10)
then they&#39;re able to do their City (71:08 - 71:11)
Safari instead you know like I wonder if (71:10 - 71:13)
it&#39;s just if that&#39;s where the difference (71:11 - 71:16)
happens is like what can they agree with (71:13 - 71:19)
uh on with the city that they&#39;re going (71:16 - 71:21)
to be in yeah cuz like in in Madrid (71:19 - 71:23)
there were (71:21 - 71:25)
official we worked with the city of (71:23 - 71:28)
Madrid to make these three or four (71:25 - 71:31)
routes mhm and they were the best routes (71:28 - 71:33)
I&#39;ve ever done they were like going back (71:31 - 71:38)
to the safari City experience and soul (71:33 - 71:40)
like they were very curated the routes (71:38 - 71:42)
that I went on which is like two of the (71:40 - 71:44)
four were like oh I understand why we&#39;re (71:42 - 71:46)
walking down the street I understand why (71:44 - 71:49)
we&#39;re turning here oh like I I wanted to (71:46 - 71:51)
see this and I didn&#39;t know this route (71:49 - 71:53)
was going to take us here so we can mark (71:51 - 71:54)
this off we can check this off like (71:53 - 71:56)
that&#39;s so cool that the like (71:54 - 71:57)
this was just on the way I would have (71:56 - 72:01)
never guessed that it was here yeah I I (71:57 - 72:03)
will say I just clicked into the Safari (72:01 - 72:06)
like like like there&#39;s like links within (72:03 - 72:08)
the Pokemon Go website that is you know (72:06 - 72:10)
click here for more information about (72:08 - 72:14)
this specific event and the Safari Zone (72:10 - 72:17)
in uh South Korea does have (72:14 - 72:21)
a Citywide gameplay ticket that you can (72:17 - 72:23)
also apply (72:21 - 72:28)
to the so it is more like a mini go Fest (72:23 - 72:29)
G Fest because you have the city you can (72:28 - 72:32)
have the so yeah so that made yeah I (72:29 - 72:34)
mean like if that was why one complaint (72:32 - 72:38)
of Soul was like there was no because it (72:34 - 72:41)
was a city experience there was no like (72:38 - 72:44)
Hub to go toh but because there were but (72:41 - 72:46)
there were kind of hubs they there were (72:44 - 72:47)
like three big locations that they (72:46 - 72:51)
encouraged people to start at and (72:47 - 72:54)
so the location I started at which was (72:51 - 72:56)
one of the hubs there was just so many (72:54 - 72:58)
people there and so that&#39;s where I got (72:56 - 73:00)
like trades done that&#39;s where I started (72:58 - 73:01)
my day that&#39;s where I ended my day and (73:00 - 73:03)
there were a lot of people did the same (73:01 - 73:04)
they started their day there or they (73:03 - 73:05)
ended their day there and that was where (73:04 - 73:10)
you like met up with people so there I (73:05 - 73:13)
there is value to like here is a park (73:10 - 73:15)
experience like there was value to (73:13 - 73:18)
Randall&#39;s Island yeah minus the weather (73:15 - 73:20)
this Central Park is so cool I&#39;m sorry I (73:18 - 73:22)
hav just been staring at it all the (73:20 - 73:26)
pictures of it the South Korea Park yeah (73:22 - 73:27)
it (73:26 - 73:31)
is amazing hold on I&#39;ll show you where (73:27 - 73:32)
I&#39;m (73:31 - 73:34)
at I just like they&#39;ll talk because I (73:32 - 73:36)
want to look at these (73:34 - 73:38)
pictures (73:36 - 73:40)
it it feels (73:38 - 73:43)
like sorry just going off of like the (73:40 - 73:44)
cost for these as (73:43 - 73:48)
well it feels like the one in Indonesia (73:44 - 73:49)
is a lot more (73:48 - 73:51)
expensive (73:49 - 73:54)
than like even if you buy the Safari (73:51 - 73:57)
Zone in South Korea with the (73:54 - 74:01)
city with the uh Citywide gameplay (73:57 - 74:04)
you&#39;re paying 29,000 (74:01 - 74:08)
one and then and I have to exchange and (74:04 - 74:12)
then um for the city Safari in Indonesia (74:08 - 74:14)
it&#39;s (74:12 - 74:16)
125,000 uh (74:14 - 74:19)
Indonesian rupia I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m I&#39;m (74:16 - 74:21)
probably not pronouncing that correctly (74:19 - 74:22)
um which (74:21 - 74:26)
seems like quite a bit more I think (74:22 - 74:27)
that&#39;s (74:26 - 74:30)
$11 I think the Jakarta yeah you&#39;re (74:27 - 74:33)
right it&#39;s seven it&#39;s $7 for the CD (74:30 - 74:35)
experience and then (74:33 - 74:38)
it&#39;s $20 for the um okay for the South (74:35 - 74:41)
koream one so never mind I&#39;m wrong I (74:38 - 74:44)
thought those currencies were closer but (74:41 - 74:46)
excellent well the Pokemon that people (74:44 - 74:47)
care about is skadoo I didn&#39;t realize (74:46 - 74:49)
that non- shiny skadoo was so sought (74:47 - 74:52)
after uh cuz I threw away like 40 of (74:49 - 74:54)
them on my way back from like Korea I (74:52 - 74:56)
was like I I mean I still have like 10 (74:54 - 74:58)
of them but I just I just threw them (74:56 - 75:00)
away CU I was like I have so many I you (74:58 - 75:02)
need to trade me one please when we see (75:00 - 75:03)
each (75:02 - 75:05)
other (75:03 - 75:09)
um and now I kind of wish I I had (75:05 - 75:10)
multiple shiny scoo but I was like (75:09 - 75:11)
trading them to people who didn&#39;t get (75:10 - 75:13)
shinye cadoo that (75:11 - 75:16)
weekend like I I traded one for like uh (75:13 - 75:19)
the Chinese Slowpoke with the cowboy hat (75:16 - 75:21)
cuz I was like ah like oh that sucks (75:19 - 75:23)
like you didn&#39;t get it here I want the (75:21 - 75:26)
Slowpoke but apparently at New York go (75:23 - 75:28)
fast you could trade shiny scoo for (75:26 - 75:32)
anything people wanted it so badly mhm (75:28 - 75:34)
like I traded a regular sco for a shiny (75:32 - 75:36)
corsola just because people wanted (75:34 - 75:39)
regular scoo so so badly it&#39;s kind of (75:36 - 75:42)
crazy how like Pokemon go can take a (75:39 - 75:44)
very average Basic Pokemon and make it (75:42 - 75:46)
this like really rare Powerhouse in the (75:44 - 75:51)
game M M for all that time was so rare I (75:46 - 75:54)
remember when Marie came out oh my gosh (75:51 - 75:57)
I remember when Chomp came out and (75:54 - 75:59)
people were trading anything for a (75:57 - 76:04)
Gibble MH MH (75:59 - 76:04)
so yeah we have uh we have (76:04 - 76:12)
two two new (76:08 - 76:15)
events that are on the other side of the (76:12 - 76:19)
world which is pretty cool (76:15 - 76:21)
mhm I believe there&#39;s supposed to be an (76:19 - 76:24)
event in Brazil at the end of December I (76:21 - 76:26)
don&#39;t think that was a secret because I (76:24 - 76:29)
think at was it Gamescom where Niantic (76:26 - 76:31)
was there they talked about (76:29 - 76:35)
how an event was coming to (76:31 - 76:37)
Brazil uh but they have not officially (76:35 - 76:39)
put anything on their (76:37 - 76:42)
website yeah I see I see like an article (76:39 - 76:44)
about it but not nothing from the (76:42 - 76:46)
Pokemon Go website I will say I was (76:44 - 76:48)
looking back at just the history of (76:46 - 76:50)
Safari&#39;s own events and they do kind of (76:48 - 76:53)
happen around the calendar so it&#39;s still (76:50 - 76:55)
possible that like we end up with like a (76:53 - 76:58)
November Safari Zone or something that (76:55 - 76:59)
they just didn&#39;t announce right off the (76:58 - 77:02)
bat I mean yeah you know happened all (76:59 - 77:04)
throughout the the year it looks like so (77:02 - 77:06)
I mean it&#39;s end July and these are the (77:04 - 77:09)
end of September so if (77:06 - 77:11)
anything I like I get why they don&#39;t (77:09 - 77:12)
announce them earlier because they don&#39;t (77:11 - 77:14)
want to take away from like go Fest (77:12 - 77:15)
season but (77:14 - 77:20)
like two months to like that&#39;s not a lot (77:15 - 77:25)
of time a lot of time to plan MH um but (77:20 - 77:27)
like very cool for like even if you (77:25 - 77:28)
can&#39;t if you&#39;re like an American (77:27 - 77:29)
listening you&#39;re like oh I wish I could (77:28 - 77:31)
go like it&#39;s still cool for people in (77:29 - 77:35)
those areas because like (77:31 - 77:37)
they they might struggle to come to like (77:35 - 77:39)
a go Fest or something right like the (77:37 - 77:41)
one thing that America has been getting (77:39 - 77:42)
and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going away (77:41 - 77:46)
anytime soon is the CNO hoen jotto (77:42 - 77:49)
whatever thing that happens early in the (77:46 - 77:51)
year and then I I don&#39;t think there&#39;s (77:49 - 77:52)
ever going to be a point in time where (77:51 - 77:56)
America does not get a go Fest (77:52 - 77:59)
I think I think it is safe to say don&#39;t (77:56 - 78:03)
see that happening um I will say I I was (77:59 - 78:05)
just looking this up because you brought (78:03 - 78:08)
up Brazil and yeah it looks like Pokemon (78:05 - 78:09)
go had announced at like you said at (78:08 - 78:13)
gamescon um Latin American Gamescom uh (78:09 - 78:17)
yes that they were going to have the (78:13 - 78:20)
biggest in-person (78:17 - 78:22)
event that they&#39;ve ever had in Brazil in (78:20 - 78:24)
December so it looks like it would be in (78:22 - 78:27)
Sal Paulo but yeah nothing like since (78:24 - 78:29)
then it doesn&#39;t look like theyve yeah so (78:27 - 78:31)
they&#39;ve officially said this in front of (78:29 - 78:33)
people but they have not officially set (78:31 - 78:35)
it on their (78:33 - 78:37)
own communication (78:35 - 78:40)
Outlets so like you said December right (78:37 - 78:43)
you got to wait till like October before (78:40 - 78:45)
they decide to announce that well and (78:43 - 78:48)
they they had they had one they&#39;ve had (78:45 - 78:50)
one in Singapore I think twice like some (78:48 - 78:53)
sort of Safari Zone something in (78:50 - 78:55)
Singapore I think they did something (78:53 - 78:57)
thing in Taiwan yeah they did they did (78:55 - 78:58)
the thing in Taiwan earlier this year (78:57 - 79:01)
cuz that was like very close to when (78:58 - 79:05)
that Pokemon Center opened in Taiwan MH (79:01 - 79:09)
um so they are doing a lot of events (79:05 - 79:12)
regardless I just kind of expected (79:09 - 79:16)
another event to go with this but I also (79:12 - 79:18)
expected not a huge difference between (79:16 - 79:20)
Safari Zone and what was the other one (79:18 - 79:23)
city Safari but City Safari yeah but (79:20 - 79:26)
okay there&#39;s there&#39;s a difference there (79:23 - 79:29)
so City Safari yeah I mean I to your (79:26 - 79:31)
point I mean they really did it was like (79:29 - 79:34)
four in a row that were City Safari (79:31 - 79:36)
there was Soul Barcelona Mexico City and (79:34 - 79:42)
then um tinan that were all City safaris (79:36 - 79:46)
so and Jakarta will be City Safari yeah (79:42 - 79:52)
and then inan will be Safari Zone with a (79:46 - 79:54)
Citywide experience that you can add on (79:52 - 79:57)
I o believe there is like some really (79:54 - 80:00)
special hotel package you can get for (79:57 - 80:02)
inchon um and they&#39;re only making that (80:00 - 80:06)
hotel package available to tourists so (80:02 - 80:08)
if you live in South Korea you cannot (80:06 - 80:12)
apply for that hotel package it&#39;s like a (80:08 - 80:14)
resort hotel (80:12 - 80:16)
thing um but I don&#39;t have that (80:14 - 80:18)
information in front of me nor do I like (80:16 - 80:20)
that will probably apply to one person (80:18 - 80:21)
listening to this podcast being like I&#39;m (80:20 - 80:23)
going to South Korea tell me about the (80:21 - 80:26)
package (80:23 - 80:26)
okay last bit of news uh is the TCG (80:27 - 80:31)
illustration (80:30 - 80:34)
contest it&#39;s been (80:31 - 80:37)
uh it&#39;s been so busy that this news came (80:34 - 80:39)
out and then we never really covered (80:37 - 80:44)
it uh but the disqualifications (80:39 - 80:48)
happened the there were six entries this (80:44 - 80:51)
is off Pokey Beach this was on July 3rd (80:48 - 80:53)
six entries got disqualified and they (80:51 - 80:55)
added six new artists so we talked about (80:53 - 80:57)
that we talked about some amount of (80:55 - 81:00)
people were going to get disqualified (80:57 - 81:02)
yep I thought it was going to be more (81:00 - 81:06)
than six but it was just all VK which we (81:02 - 81:09)
talked about in depth so that was VK had (81:06 - 81:13)
four EVs and two Pikachus they broke (81:09 - 81:16)
multiple rules AI art multiple (81:13 - 81:19)
submissions all of that stuff they were (81:16 - 81:22)
the only six (81:19 - 81:26)
disqualified now there was some people (81:22 - 81:28)
speculating that a couple other pieces (81:26 - 81:32)
could be AI art but it was hard to tell (81:28 - 81:35)
and that&#39;s the unfortunate thing about (81:32 - 81:37)
this you don&#39;t want to like disqualify (81:35 - 81:40)
somebody because you think it might be (81:37 - 81:43)
Ai and then that&#39;s weird because they&#39;re (81:40 - 81:45)
going to be (81:43 - 81:49)
like it&#39;s not weird if it was AI but it (81:45 - 81:52)
is y&#39;all haven&#39;t been following the (81:49 - 81:55)
Dungeons and Dragons art drama as much (81:52 - 81:57)
as I have been and the nightmare that (81:55 - 82:00)
some of these artists have been going (81:57 - 82:05)
through cuz there is an active hunt for (82:00 - 82:07)
finding AI art and then they go after a (82:05 - 82:09)
person&#39;s art and then that poor person (82:07 - 82:11)
has to come online and (82:09 - 82:14)
say hi are the choices I made here are (82:11 - 82:17)
all my sketches here are my layers and (82:14 - 82:19)
then they spend a week of their life (82:17 - 82:21)
trying to defend that they&#39;re an actual (82:19 - 82:23)
artist proving all of their work because (82:21 - 82:27)
somebody thought it was AI like this (82:23 - 82:30)
whole situation is just getting more and (82:27 - 82:33)
more nightmarish and I feel so bad for (82:30 - 82:35)
these artists like because there are (82:33 - 82:39)
stuff people who are clearly using AI (82:35 - 82:41)
yeah and then there are people who make (82:39 - 82:44)
choices that people like that&#39;s AI like (82:41 - 82:47)
also somebody&#39;s accusing me and my (82:44 - 82:50)
pictures pictures I&#39;ve posted of myself (82:47 - 82:53)
as being AI right now currently in my (82:50 - 82:56)
existence over the last two days like (82:53 - 82:59)
these are actual pictures I took them (82:56 - 83:02)
myself and they&#39;re like that&#39;s AI I&#39;m (82:59 - 83:07)
like no it&#39;s it&#39;s me it it also doesn&#39;t (83:02 - 83:08)
help that (83:07 - 83:11)
like Facebook meta whatever you want to (83:08 - 83:14)
call it adds this weird AI tag to your (83:11 - 83:18)
Instagram post I I I posted that um that (83:14 - 83:21)
tagui thing yeah where it was just it (83:18 - 83:25)
was just toi and then I put like this (83:21 - 83:27)
tagiri will no it was the sorry it was (83:25 - 83:29)
the Pikachu Raichu mimikyu it was the (83:27 - 83:32)
event before the tagiri and I posted (83:29 - 83:34)
like alolan Raichu will be in the (83:32 - 83:36)
blueberry Academy and Pikachu will be in (83:34 - 83:39)
Pala and Pichu will be in kakami right (83:36 - 83:43)
like I I I didn&#39;t use any generative (83:39 - 83:47)
fill or content aware fill I (83:43 - 83:49)
literally imported the picture off (83:47 - 83:52)
Twitter mhm I used the little text tool (83:49 - 83:55)
to add the text and then I went like (83:52 - 83:58)
like effects drop shadow yeah and I (83:55 - 84:00)
added a little drop shadow and then I (83:58 - 84:04)
added a blur a gazan blur so like the (84:00 - 84:07)
the the Pikachu raid was blurred that (84:04 - 84:10)
was it I did like the two basic things (84:07 - 84:13)
in Photoshop blur and drop shadow they (84:10 - 84:15)
have existed for like 40 years in (84:13 - 84:17)
Photoshop and then I went to upload it (84:15 - 84:21)
to Instagram and it was like AI was used (84:17 - 84:22)
to make this (84:21 - 84:25)
picture no no it wasn&#39;t (84:22 - 84:28)
no it was not drop shadow tool and a the (84:25 - 84:32)
gausian blur (84:28 - 84:37)
yep yeah they they&#39;re fixing that fixing (84:32 - 84:41)
so they say uh that whole situation with (84:37 - 84:42)
even if you&#39;re like a photographer I&#39;ve (84:41 - 84:44)
seen this with photographers they (84:42 - 84:45)
they&#39;ll take they&#39;ll they&#39;ll take a (84:44 - 84:47)
picture of I don&#39;t know like Mount Fuji (84:45 - 84:49)
and they&#39;ll they&#39;ll bring it into (84:47 - 84:51)
Photoshop and they&#39;ll just like okay I&#39;m (84:49 - 84:52)
going to boost the saturation a little (84:51 - 84:53)
bit I&#39;m going to like bring down the (84:52 - 84:55)
brightness and now I&#39;m going to send it (84:53 - 84:57)
over to Instagram and then it goes made (84:55 - 85:00)
with AI yeahh That&#39;s crazy I&#39;ve heard (84:57 - 85:03)
that if you actually do use Ai and then (85:00 - 85:06)
just resave the picture like then it (85:03 - 85:08)
doesn&#39;t get uploaded with the made with (85:06 - 85:12)
AI so like this doesn&#39;t work like this (85:08 - 85:17)
is such this is just the worst timeline (85:12 - 85:18)
like all of these people who are (85:17 - 85:21)
actually doing actual work who are doing (85:18 - 85:24)
what they can are competing against a (85:21 - 85:25)
system (85:24 - 85:27)
that doesn&#39;t understand them people who (85:25 - 85:30)
are actively hunting for them and then (85:27 - 85:32)
people who will look at actual AI stuff (85:30 - 85:34)
and say wow that looks great I&#39;ll put it (85:32 - 85:38)
in a contest like (85:34 - 85:38)
yeah it&#39;s exhausting I&#39;m happy they (85:38 - 85:44)
included six new people like they (85:41 - 85:46)
replaced them with six artists like it&#39;s (85:44 - 85:48)
good that they did the right thing but (85:46 - 85:49)
also I (85:48 - 85:52)
don&#39;t know how we are getting out of (85:49 - 85:58)
this um okay so they they there was 300 (85:52 - 86:01)
entries six of them were taken up by (85:58 - 86:04)
VK they eliminated VK that was the only (86:01 - 86:06)
one that was the only person persons I (86:04 - 86:08)
guess because it was three different (86:06 - 86:10)
four different (86:08 - 86:14)
vks it&#39;s probably the same person they (86:10 - 86:18)
yeah they the same person they uh added (86:14 - 86:20)
six entries and (86:18 - 86:24)
then last week they brought down the 300 (86:20 - 86:27)
to 100 which is normal and then they&#39;ll (86:24 - 86:29)
bring down I think the 100 I think they (86:27 - 86:31)
bring it down to what like 36 or (86:29 - 86:33)
something and then they&#39;ll do the finals (86:31 - 86:36)
or something like (86:33 - 86:36)
that the six that they added did not (86:36 - 86:43)
make it into the top (86:40 - 86:46)
100 I went through each one (86:43 - 86:49)
so but (86:46 - 86:52)
like I I when when I when I I posted (86:49 - 86:54)
like a clip explaining this on on like (86:52 - 86:56)
Instagram and like somebody commented (86:54 - 86:58)
they were like I&#39;m an artist and I (86:56 - 86:59)
submitted and I didn&#39;t get picked in the (86:58 - 87:01)
first 300 and they were like it kind of (86:59 - 87:03)
sucks because well whoever they (87:01 - 87:06)
eliminate and bring in why would those (87:03 - 87:08)
people make it any further if they (87:06 - 87:10)
couldn&#39;t even make it into the first 300 (87:08 - 87:12)
to begin with yeah which is like a (87:10 - 87:15)
really good point like it it&#39;s almost (87:12 - 87:17)
like a I don&#39;t know how you win in that (87:15 - 87:18)
situation I don&#39;t know how you make it (87:17 - 87:21)
right of like we&#39;re adding people (87:18 - 87:24)
because their slot was taken up by our (87:21 - 87:28)
oversight of this VK guy right but also (87:24 - 87:30)
we didn&#39;t pick them initially so why (87:28 - 87:32)
would they go any further well it (87:30 - 87:34)
doesn&#39;t it it all depends on how they (87:32 - 87:36)
initially picked the 300 right like if (87:34 - 87:38)
it was just like each let&#39;s say each (87:36 - 87:39)
judge got to pick a certain amount but (87:38 - 87:43)
now for the next 300 they&#39;ve changed how (87:39 - 87:45)
they&#39;re judging it so now maybe like two (87:43 - 87:47)
judges have a decision on a certain (87:45 - 87:48)
percentage of them I mean it could still (87:47 - 87:50)
work like it could still work where they (87:48 - 87:52)
would they didn&#39;t so I guess there&#39;s (87:50 - 87:55)
that but yeah (87:52 - 87:56)
we have like we don&#39;t know how they&#39;re (87:55 - 87:58)
judging any of this right we only know (87:56 - 88:01)
that like there are Judges but we have (87:58 - 88:05)
no idea like what they yeah what theying (88:01 - 88:08)
what they who picking what yeah like do (88:05 - 88:10)
all the judges have to agree on a single (88:08 - 88:12)
piece or like what you said is I hope (88:10 - 88:14)
not like that 12 people agreed that the (88:12 - 88:19)
v six VK ones like no please no don&#39;t (88:14 - 88:22)
let that be true like uh but yeah I mean (88:19 - 88:23)
we don&#39;t know you know they could have (88:22 - 88:24)
changed how the judging happened in (88:23 - 88:27)
round two versus round one I mean it&#39;s (88:24 - 88:29)
highly it&#39;s highly (88:27 - 88:32)
subjective and it&#39;s also one of the (88:29 - 88:35)
things like okay so you picked your top (88:32 - 88:38)
600 favorites and then you&#39;re just going (88:35 - 88:40)
like at that point really you kind of (88:38 - 88:42)
know what your favorites are like if (88:40 - 88:44)
you&#39;re a judge and you&#39;re look like I (88:42 - 88:46)
don&#39;t know how much you can (88:44 - 88:51)
change your opinions on things each time (88:46 - 88:53)
you have to relook at things like yeah (88:51 - 88:55)
there&#39;s the ones you said yes yes yes (88:53 - 88:57)
yes yes yes yes yes too and then there&#39;s (88:55 - 88:58)
ones who like okay okay I&#39;ll move it on (88:57 - 89:00)
and (88:58 - 89:02)
then like I don&#39;t think these artists (89:00 - 89:06)
are like making a case to the judges or (89:02 - 89:08)
like presenting more art like this is it (89:06 - 89:10)
and then do they go to a different judge (89:08 - 89:12)
do a different judge look at your picks (89:10 - 89:14)
like they&#39;re not particularly clear how (89:12 - 89:18)
the judging happens it&#39;s (89:14 - 89:21)
just it they&#39;re always it&#39;s always just (89:18 - 89:25)
a weird process uh often very hidden (89:21 - 89:29)
behind a lot of layers also the the (89:25 - 89:30)
thing we also didn&#39;t talk about cuz it&#39;s (89:29 - 89:32)
been like a month since we&#39;ve talked (89:30 - 89:35)
about this is that when they went to (89:32 - 89:39)
eliminate VK there was also like 10 (89:35 - 89:42)
people that their name was changed on (89:39 - 89:45)
the website so the wrong names were (89:42 - 89:48)
assigned to certain pictures and that (89:45 - 89:49)
was (89:48 - 89:55)
corrected so it makes me also think that (89:49 - 89:57)
a lot of speculation this episode it (89:55 - 90:00)
also makes me think like these pieces (89:57 - 90:01)
were just presented in a way without (90:00 - 90:04)
like a name attached to it yeah right so (90:01 - 90:06)
then you kind of think like how did one (90:04 - 90:09)
person get six (90:06 - 90:09)
entries like the judges were just (90:09 - 90:13)
looking at the art they weren&#39;t looking (90:11 - 90:15)
at people&#39;s names right sure and then (90:13 - 90:17)
somebody whoever uploaded them also (90:15 - 90:18)
didn&#39;t have the right names because (90:17 - 90:20)
multiple people&#39;s names were misassigned (90:18 - 90:21)
on the (90:20 - 90:26)
website yeah but yeah weird what um the (90:21 - 90:28)
pictures I never actually looked this up (90:26 - 90:29)
the pictures that they replaced to those (90:28 - 90:33)
six with was it two Pikachu and four (90:29 - 90:36)
Eevee the the two Pikachus and the four (90:33 - 90:38)
Eevees were with VK they replaced it (90:36 - 90:41)
with like um uh it&#39;s in the Poke Beach (90:38 - 90:44)
article one two for (90:41 - 90:46)
alligator yeah so none of them are (90:44 - 90:49)
Pikachu no none of them what&#39;s also (90:46 - 90:52)
interesting is out of the top 100 that (90:49 - 90:54)
you can look at Pikachu and Eevee have (90:52 - 90:58)
like the least amount of entries and we (90:54 - 91:00)
talked about this if you&#39;re going to use (90:58 - 91:06)
AI to generate Pokemon AI is more likely (91:00 - 91:09)
to make a Pikachu or an Eevee than it (91:06 - 91:12)
would a kidon or a Flygon just because (91:09 - 91:17)
there is so much Pikachu and Eevee out (91:12 - 91:20)
there that it would understand that (91:17 - 91:22)
better because AI has to ultimately (91:20 - 91:24)
steal from something they have to take (91:22 - 91:27)
other people&#39;s work to make to make (91:24 - 91:29)
their own work they need a they need a (91:27 - 91:31)
base of something so I I don&#39;t know if (91:29 - 91:34)
that&#39;s intentional or just a (91:31 - 91:36)
coincidence (91:34 - 91:38)
but you know when you cut down 300 (91:36 - 91:41)
entries to (91:38 - 91:43)
100 a lot of fer alligators made have (91:41 - 91:45)
passed a lot of Absol made have passed (91:43 - 91:49)
but there there were way more Eevees and (91:45 - 91:50)
Pikachus (91:49 - 91:52)
initially than there are now I think (91:50 - 91:55)
only four Eevees made it to the top 100 (91:52 - 91:58)
and five (91:55 - 92:02)
Pikachu six P seven Pikachu that&#39;s a PR (91:58 - 92:03)
wild one of those Pikachu looks straight (92:02 - 92:08)
out of like the Honolulu or like the (92:03 - 92:09)
world (92:08 - 92:11)
championship (92:09 - 92:13)
artwork very (92:11 - 92:15)
interesting it&#39;s different but it&#39;s just (92:13 - 92:18)
like has that same Vibe (92:15 - 92:22)
but it it&#39;s it it is this my personal (92:18 - 92:24)
opinion it is easier in (92:22 - 92:27)
to look at a hundred pieces of art than (92:24 - 92:31)
it is 300 pieces like like yeah (92:27 - 92:33)
that&#39;s like when I&#39;m looking through (92:31 - 92:36)
this like everything just seems so good (92:33 - 92:37)
and then I remember going back through (92:36 - 92:41)
the the 300 and like I don&#39;t remember (92:37 - 92:43)
seeing some of these pieces but they (92:41 - 92:45)
were obviously there in the (92:43 - 92:47)
300 but there was just so much to look (92:45 - 92:49)
at like there&#39;s so many Mel medals I&#39;m (92:47 - 92:51)
looking at right now being like this Mel (92:49 - 92:52)
metal is incredible I don&#39;t remember (92:51 - 92:55)
seeing it a month ago at all (92:52 - 92:56)
it gets a little (92:55 - 92:59)
overwhelming so I not again not to (92:56 - 93:02)
defend the judges but I would imagine (92:59 - 93:05)
that looking at what 20,000 pieces of (93:02 - 93:07)
art to be like we need to get this down (93:05 - 93:08)
to (93:07 - 93:10)
300 is (93:08 - 93:13)
exhausting (93:10 - 93:14)
yep (93:13 - 93:17)
yeah yeah (93:14 - 93:19)
agreed and I don&#39;t think they&#39;re doing (93:17 - 93:22)
it as a full-time job either like if you (93:19 - 93:25)
look at the list of judges (93:22 - 93:27)
yeah they weren&#39;t some of them like (93:25 - 93:33)
Executives yeah yeah like they like the (93:27 - 93:35)
first five names are like the president (93:33 - 93:37)
the president the president the (93:35 - 93:39)
executive director the executive (93:37 - 93:41)
director like these people are just like (93:39 - 93:43)
nodding and saying sure call us in for (93:41 - 93:46)
the last 100 like I can see the art and (93:43 - 93:48)
illustration directors because that&#39;s (93:46 - 93:49)
their job going through each and every (93:48 - 93:52)
one of them but that&#39;s like a week of (93:49 - 93:55)
their life mhm (93:52 - 93:57)
and at least they&#39;re getting paid for it (93:55 - 93:58)
I always feel weird about these art (93:57 - 94:01)
contests anyways CU (93:58 - 94:03)
it&#39;s gosh we&#39;ve been talking about the (94:01 - 94:05)
art contest this is this is (94:03 - 94:09)
the we have officially made it 14 years (94:05 - 94:11)
of this (94:09 - 94:15)
podcast 14 years of this show and the (94:11 - 94:17)
amount of times we&#39;ve talked about this (94:15 - 94:20)
art contest on and off for the for for (94:17 - 94:21)
14 (94:20 - 94:25)
years it&#39;s just like it&#39;s cool cool and (94:21 - 94:28)
people are very talented yes and this (94:25 - 94:30)
art is absolutely incredible but there&#39;s (94:28 - 94:34)
still like this slight uneasiness that I (94:30 - 94:38)
have that a billion dooll company is (94:34 - 94:40)
saying hey send us your free (94:38 - 94:44)
art and three of you will get a TCG card (94:40 - 94:47)
at the end of this I mean how much this (94:44 - 94:49)
can they keep in their own portfolio (94:47 - 94:51)
like if they send it in what are the (94:49 - 94:54)
right situation (94:51 - 94:57)
that&#39;s such a I have such a lot (94:54 - 95:00)
of yeah questions about what they are (94:57 - 95:03)
allowed to do with the art (95:00 - 95:06)
afterwards well there there there there (95:03 - 95:09)
have been a ton of artists that make it (95:06 - 95:11)
pretty far and then they end up making (95:09 - 95:15)
cards for the future which is super cool (95:11 - 95:17)
yeah I was going to say though like I (95:15 - 95:19)
think I said this few weeks ago but the (95:17 - 95:21)
winner of the 2022 the Greninja card (95:19 - 95:23)
they&#39;re making they&#39;re making a card (95:21 - 95:24)
that&#39;s coming out this week that that&#39;s (95:23 - 95:26)
coming out in the set that comes out on (95:24 - 95:28)
Friday and it&#39;s like cool to see that (95:26 - 95:30)
right to see like oh you won and but (95:28 - 95:32)
then it didn&#39;t stop there it&#39;s not like (95:30 - 95:34)
you never got to draw or illustrate for (95:32 - 95:37)
the Pokemon company again yeah there&#39;s (95:34 - 95:40)
there&#39;s totally value like again you can (95:37 - 95:41)
you can go to bullipedia they have a (95:40 - 95:45)
really great Wiki of all the artists (95:41 - 95:47)
that have submitted and then if those (95:45 - 95:49)
artists have made future cards their (95:47 - 95:51)
names are like clickable and you can see (95:49 - 95:52)
all the (95:51 - 95:55)
cards um there are a l of freelance (95:52 - 95:58)
artists out there yeah there are some (95:55 - 95:59)
artists out there that just want to make (95:58 - 96:01)
art and that doesn&#39;t bother them and (95:59 - 96:03)
that&#39;s totally valid and fair there are (96:01 - 96:05)
some artists that like they want to get (96:03 - 96:08)
paid for their time and they have every (96:05 - 96:10)
right to say that and do that like their (96:08 - 96:13)
time is valuable and their skills (96:10 - 96:16)
are unmatched in a lot of cases like (96:13 - 96:18)
some of this art is just absolutely (96:16 - 96:22)
fantastic and and gorgeous (96:18 - 96:25)
um but there and there&#39;s just for (96:22 - 96:26)
there&#39;s just like the capitalism (96:25 - 96:30)
something slightly off about (96:26 - 96:34)
like Pokemon getting 20,000 pieces of (96:30 - 96:36)
free art that they can then turn into (96:34 - 96:38)
cards that will eventually make them (96:36 - 96:40)
more money yeah M (96:38 - 96:43)
like and I you know like the three (96:40 - 96:45)
winners get paid and some of them get (96:43 - 96:49)
opportunities but and I mean to be fair (96:45 - 96:51)
well okay this is like like even going (96:49 - 96:52)
back to the six people that got like (96:51 - 96:54)
they got picked they got put in into the (96:52 - 96:55)
top 300 and then they immediately got (96:54 - 96:58)
eliminated (96:55 - 97:02)
like that sucks yeah it it it sucks to (96:58 - 97:05)
be like oh I lost out to AI art oh okay (97:02 - 97:07)
now they picked me okay now I&#39;m (97:05 - 97:09)
eliminated like does that do anything (97:07 - 97:11)
for them does that like make them feel (97:09 - 97:13)
good like I genuinely I would like to (97:11 - 97:14)
like find one of those six people and be (97:13 - 97:16)
like how do you feel about this like are (97:14 - 97:18)
you willing to do this again in the (97:16 - 97:20)
future do is this going into your (97:18 - 97:23)
portfolio do you think that like this (97:20 - 97:26)
will help you get other illustration (97:23 - 97:28)
like I genuinely want to know like how (97:26 - 97:31)
they feel because I I don&#39;t know how I (97:28 - 97:33)
would feel well one I have no artistic (97:31 - 97:35)
talent but I don&#39;t know how I would feel (97:33 - 97:36)
if like oh I didn&#39;t make into the top (97:35 - 97:39)
300 oh all of a sudden I did oh now I&#39;m (97:36 - 97:42)
eliminated and no I didn&#39;t right I&#39;m I&#39;m (97:39 - 97:44)
so I I I I would like to hear from them (97:42 - 97:46)
because I I want to know like are they (97:44 - 97:50)
allowed to promote that they got in like (97:46 - 97:51)
as they are looking for other work and (97:50 - 97:54)
advertising themselves are saying was in (97:51 - 97:57)
the top 300 for this contest something (97:54 - 97:59)
that helps them secure other jobs are (97:57 - 98:00)
they allowed to use stuff in their (97:59 - 98:03)
portfolio that came from this is that is (98:00 - 98:05)
that I mean we kind of talk about how (98:03 - 98:07)
exposure isn&#39;t anything but are they (98:05 - 98:08)
able (98:07 - 98:09)
to (98:08 - 98:12)
turn that into a selling point for (98:09 - 98:14)
themselves when they&#39;re actually looking (98:12 - 98:16)
for paying clients because a contest (98:14 - 98:19)
isn&#39;t a playing client unless you win (98:16 - 98:22)
right yeah well they are allowed I know (98:19 - 98:24)
there was the rule about that they are (98:22 - 98:28)
not allowed to post early the art early (98:24 - 98:32)
but that they can after so I mean so (98:28 - 98:34)
posting is still different than you&#39;re (98:32 - 98:36)
allowed to put it in your (98:34 - 98:40)
portfolio right right true so th those (98:36 - 98:41)
that that&#39;s where the things get where (98:40 - 98:45)
I&#39;m iffy like is this like be (98:41 - 98:48)
so as people know I&#39;ve done a lot of art (98:45 - 98:50)
for a couple of games and in my (98:48 - 98:52)
contracts it is clearly I clearly State (98:50 - 98:54)
you retain (98:52 - 98:56)
rights to use this in your (98:54 - 98:58)
portfolio I get a certain part of the (98:56 - 99:00)
copyright so that I can use it my (98:58 - 99:02)
products where you can&#39;t claim against (99:00 - 99:04)
me but you then also get to keep this (99:02 - 99:05)
you can post it you can put it in your (99:04 - 99:08)
portfolio you can use this to get other (99:05 - 99:10)
jobs you just can&#39;t use it in other (99:08 - 99:12)
products because I retain the rights to (99:10 - 99:15)
that to use it in my products like those (99:12 - 99:17)
are the contracts that I&#39;ve signed right (99:15 - 99:20)
um so the question is is like what is (99:17 - 99:22)
the contract that they have are they (99:20 - 99:24)
allowed to use it elsewhere are (99:22 - 99:26)
in their portfolio do they retain the (99:24 - 99:28)
rights does Pokemon company retain the (99:26 - 99:31)
rights where where does all this fall (99:28 - 99:33)
I&#39;m so intensely curious about that and (99:31 - 99:34)
it&#39;s probably somewhere on their website (99:33 - 99:36)
but I haven&#39;t looked for it uh the art (99:34 - 99:38)
submission guidelines doesn&#39;t talk (99:36 - 99:41)
anything about who owns what exactly but (99:38 - 99:44)
I don&#39;t know if like if you are picked (99:41 - 99:48)
for the top 300 and I think somebody on (99:44 - 99:50)
like one of my Instagram posts said they (99:48 - 99:51)
did make it in a top 300 which is like (99:50 - 99:53)
super cool for them I don&#39;t know if you (99:51 - 99:55)
get you have to like sign something when (99:53 - 99:57)
you get picked to the top 300 of like (99:55 - 99:59)
okay we&#39;re moving forward with (99:57 - 100:02)
you do you agree to these new terms and (99:59 - 100:05)
terms now that we&#39;re moving forward I&#39;m (100:02 - 100:09)
not sure if that&#39;s a conversation that (100:05 - 100:10)
happens I would assume that they would (100:09 - 100:13)
have to sign something I didn&#39;t realize (100:10 - 100:15)
that there&#39;s also a cash prize to (100:13 - 100:18)
winning there is $5,000 for the winner (100:15 - 100:21)
and then $3,000 for the best EX card (100:18 - 100:25)
winner and then the first six Runner uh (100:21 - 100:27)
Runners up each get (100:25 - 100:30)
$1,000 yeah um and then 15 people who (100:27 - 100:33)
have who get the judges Award winners (100:30 - 100:34)
each get (100:33 - 100:37)
$500 yeah I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t realize that (100:34 - 100:38)
before I thought it was just the promo (100:37 - 100:42)
card yeah no there is there is (100:38 - 100:42)
money (100:42 - 100:47)
um well we&#39;ll see you guys in two weeks (100:44 - 100:49)
when we talk about I don&#39;t actually know (100:47 - 100:52)
when the next elimination (100:49 - 100:55)
is I think they&#39;re slightly behind (100:52 - 101:00)
because they had to deal with the AI (100:55 - 101:03)
thing um and look like yes the Pokemon (101:00 - 101:07)
company messed up but if you follow any (101:03 - 101:11)
contest or whatever in any other (101:07 - 101:13)
fandom this is going to happen this is (101:11 - 101:14)
going to continue to happen this is (101:13 - 101:17)
going to continue to get worse yeah as (101:14 - 101:19)
AI gets better and (101:17 - 101:23)
better it&#39;s I they&#39;re I I don&#39;t know if (101:19 - 101:24)
company are just going to like stop (101:23 - 101:27)
doing it or it doesn&#39;t sound like the (101:24 - 101:28)
Pokemon company is going to stop doing (101:27 - 101:30)
it but it also sounds like they now need (101:28 - 101:34)
to hire M literally one person to go (101:30 - 101:36)
through after things are selected and (101:34 - 101:38)
like really go back over but again I (101:36 - 101:40)
think every company has to do that at (101:38 - 101:41)
this point (101:40 - 101:43)
like if you&#39;re not an artist you&#39;re not (101:41 - 101:47)
going to like see some of these things (101:43 - 101:47)
initially my (101:48 - 101:56)
my fear is that out (101:50 - 101:56)
of somewhat necessity they&#39;re going to (101:56 - 102:01)
start asking for like things like show (101:58 - 102:03)
you&#39;ll need to show us your drafts show (102:01 - 102:07)
us your layers show us all of these (102:03 - 102:10)
files a as part of the submission to (102:07 - 102:13)
help bypass this to be like this is the (102:10 - 102:15)
way we&#39;re going to check and submit it (102:13 - 102:16)
and then there&#39;s still because there&#39;s (102:15 - 102:18)
only so much time you can do to review (102:16 - 102:22)
it like it got caught because a million (102:18 - 102:24)
eyes were suddenly on it right like a (102:22 - 102:27)
million eyes could go through each one (102:24 - 102:30)
and look at it it&#39;s you know like I have (102:27 - 102:32)
one editor for my books and then I (102:30 - 102:34)
released it to the public and then seven (102:32 - 102:37)
more mistakes were found because 10,000 (102:34 - 102:38)
more people suddenly looked at it and (102:37 - 102:40)
said oh this is weird or this is a (102:38 - 102:44)
spelling wrong that we all missed uh (102:40 - 102:47)
it&#39;s I I don&#39;t know what the future (102:44 - 102:50)
solution to this ever growing problem is (102:47 - 102:53)
going to be because people people in (102:50 - 102:55)
these Ians aren&#39;t going to suddenly get (102:53 - 102:58)
more time to do this they&#39;re just going (102:55 - 103:00)
to start having to put more burden on (102:58 - 103:04)
the artist submitting um and that&#39;s just (103:00 - 103:05)
really (103:04 - 103:08)
unfortunate right and it&#39;s like I got to (103:05 - 103:10)
make the work I got to show my work I (103:08 - 103:12)
got to jump through all these hoops (103:10 - 103:14)
for a company that&#39;s going to eventually (103:12 - 103:16)
profit yeah for somebody else to make (103:14 - 103:18)
profit off of it and they&#39;re not even (103:16 - 103:23)
kind of paying me for my time yeah (103:18 - 103:23)
um just as a another thing uh the next (103:23 - 103:30)
round is the finals I mean like it looks (103:27 - 103:34)
like this is it so it&#39;s 100 right now (103:30 - 103:36)
and it looks like the next time they do (103:34 - 103:38)
announce them it&#39;s the winners and (103:36 - 103:42)
everything so oh there&#39;s no like yeah (103:38 - 103:44)
the the rules did say that the top 100 (103:42 - 103:45)
would come out in July so it looks like (103:44 - 103:47)
they actually are on time still with (103:45 - 103:49)
their timing and then it looks like the (103:47 - 103:52)
next round is the finals (103:49 - 103:55)
so um no no no date on when that&#39;s (103:52 - 103:59)
supposed to actually happen though (103:55 - 103:59)
so well if you&#39;re one of the six that (103:59 - 104:05)
got added and then eliminated and you (104:02 - 104:07)
listen to this podcast uh reach out I (104:05 - 104:10)
would I would love to talk about the (104:07 - 104:13)
process of what happened there uh we can (104:10 - 104:14)
even have you on the show because I (104:13 - 104:16)
think I think that would be an (104:14 - 104:19)
interesting perspective to (104:16 - 104:22)
have uh I think that&#39;s it for the show (104:19 - 104:24)

who want to know what happened the (105:15 - 105:19)
