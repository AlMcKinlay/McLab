[Music] (0:02 - 0:23)
what's up everyone welcome to the 260 (0:20 - 0:25)
eighth episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:23 - 0:29)
it's super effective I am your host SBJ (0:25 - 0:32)
and with me today I have will and I have (0:29 - 0:34)
a very sad announcement to make the (0:32 - 0:38)
battery on my original 3ds is weird oh (0:34 - 0:41)
yeah that's right what you can change (0:38 - 0:44)
the battery yeah no yeah we'll anderson (0:41 - 0:46)
cannot change the battery it's like two (0:44 - 0:49)
screws and you pull the pedal up do I (0:46 - 0:53)
look like a screwy kind of person uh we (0:49 - 0:59)
got Travis here today so Magikarp jump (0:53 - 1:00)
is ruining my life (0:59 - 1:03)
have you put money into it no no no I'm (1:00 - 1:05)
not that far it's just like I said like (1:03 - 1:08)
I said last week it's essentially a (1:05 - 1:11)
skinner box and it I don't have fun like (1:08 - 1:12)
it was fun at first because it's very (1:11 - 1:15)
cute it's not fun anymore because I've (1:12 - 1:18)
already seen all of the pretty pictures (1:15 - 1:20)
that can provide but I'm still playing (1:18 - 1:23)
it because I mean there's food that I (1:20 - 1:24)
could have my magic heart beat like I (1:23 - 1:26)
can't just wait I mean that I have three (1:24 - 1:28)
full training points like I gotta spend (1:26 - 1:31)
them I understand I will admit I'm (1:28 - 1:33)
probably the type of person whose brain (1:31 - 1:35)
is more captured by that type of (1:33 - 1:38)
mechanic than most but it just it's just (1:35 - 1:40)
nefarious and I want to escape it it's (1:38 - 1:42)
not even fun and I keep doing it yeah (1:40 - 1:44)
I'm still playing Magikarp jump as well (1:42 - 1:47)
I don't I think we'll probably not I (1:44 - 1:49)
haven't seen you move up in my (1:47 - 1:52)
leaderboard yeah I mean I got to level (1:49 - 1:54)
three and I thought that's a grand (1:52 - 1:57)
accomplishment let's leave it at that (1:54 - 2:01)
where are you right now Steve ranked 41 (1:57 - 2:04)
I think I might be a little higher let (2:01 - 2:07)
me see there was like two days I barely (2:04 - 2:09)
played because of life (2:07 - 2:12)
yeah I'm ranked 46 and I'd be having a (2:09 - 2:13)
luxury (2:12 - 2:16)
yeah I've maxed out the amount of (2:13 - 2:20)
motivation bonus you get to got an (2:16 - 2:22)
exciting show for you guys today we got (2:20 - 2:24)
some Pokemon news regarding Pokemon go (2:22 - 2:25)

the new Pokemon mobile game that is (2:25 - 2:32)
already out in Japan and then we got (2:28 - 2:35)
some emails there's some vast amount of (2:32 - 2:36)
emails that we need to catch up on so (2:35 - 2:38)
we'll probably do a lot of that and then (2:36 - 2:39)
we have our Pokemon of the week and (2:38 - 2:41)
somewhere in there we'll probably talk (2:39 - 2:44)
about Magikarp jump a little bit more so (2:41 - 2:46)
that's our show for you guys today no no (2:44 - 2:49)
interview had anything this week just (2:46 - 2:52)
just just the three of us that was nice (2:49 - 2:56)
thank you little 11 a.m. singing for you (2:52 - 2:59)
guys 11 a.m. we're post noon here buddy (2:56 - 3:02)
you're the outlier settle down here (2:59 - 3:04)
let's just jump right into spoke bad (3:02 - 3:07)
news first bit of news here is the (3:04 - 3:11)
entire 52 episode first season of the (3:07 - 3:13)
Pokemon anime called Pokemon indigo (3:11 - 3:15)
league is now available on Amazon (3:13 - 3:18)
digitally the season is now available in (3:15 - 3:20)
4 volumes 13 each Amazon claims these (3:18 - 3:24)
episodes are an quote h.d each of the (3:20 - 3:28)
each of the four volumes cost 21 99s for (3:24 - 3:31)
a total of 87 96 for the entire season (3:28 - 3:33)
due to the way Amazon has configured (3:31 - 3:35)
episodes can be purchased individually (3:33 - 3:39)
for $2.99 each because they are quote HD (3:35 - 3:42)
note that this is a real this release (3:39 - 3:44)
uses standard seasons as seen on Pokemon (3:42 - 3:46)
calm yeah this is off bubble pedia by (3:44 - 3:48)
the way let me break it down for you (3:46 - 3:51)
guess you can just buy the DVDs I know (3:48 - 3:54)
they're DVDs but you can buy the entire (3:51 - 3:56)
first season of Pokemon indigo league (3:54 - 3:59)
for less than $30 on Amazon in DVD (3:56 - 4:01)
format and I gotta agree with that way (3:59 - 4:03)
you don't have to spend 80 something to (4:01 - 4:04)
do it yeah and I gotta agree with (4:03 - 4:05)
Snorlax (4:04 - 4:07)
Snorlax monster we've had him on the (4:05 - 4:10)
show one of the news reporters on boba (4:07 - 4:13)
pedia but there's no way these episodes (4:10 - 4:15)
look better oh it's kind of like me (4:13 - 4:17)
trying to play Pokemon X on my original (4:15 - 4:20)
original original 3ds it certainly (4:17 - 4:23)
doesn't look better I don't know if I (4:20 - 4:26)
don't know if the quotes around HD were (4:23 - 4:29)
added by you or if those quotes were (4:26 - 4:30)
originally in the article but I think (4:29 - 4:33)
it's apt to include them although I have (4:30 - 4:37)
not seen this Amazon feed of them but a (4:33 - 4:39)
lot of the time we refer to (4:37 - 4:44)
720p as high-definition and I mean DVDs (4:39 - 4:46)
can do that as far as I'm oh I think (4:44 - 4:49)
720p is just like DVD quality and yet we (4:46 - 4:52)
still call it HD so maybe that's what's (4:49 - 4:54)
going on who knows I haven't seen the (4:52 - 4:57)
hands maybe maybe you get every pore in (4:54 - 5:01)
Brock's beautiful face in this (4:57 - 5:05)
high-definition remaster Wind Waker HD (5:01 - 5:08)
version of the Pokemon dark skin is (5:05 - 5:09)
flawless (5:08 - 5:12)
I mean well do you think that there are (5:09 - 5:14)
people who don't have pores because (5:12 - 5:18)
regardless of the beauty or quality or (5:14 - 5:20)
as you say flawlessness of one skin (5:18 - 5:24)
everyone still has pores his makeup is (5:20 - 5:27)
flawless sure but it covers every single (5:24 - 5:29)
pore smooths everything out so beautiful (5:27 - 5:32)
porcelain all right now (5:29 - 5:35)
misty there is a disaster huh that's a (5:32 - 5:37)
walking trainwreck right there I was (5:35 - 5:40)
watching the southern moon episodes and (5:37 - 5:43)
I'm all caught up now the DVR or (5:40 - 5:46)
whatever PlayStation view uses to play (5:43 - 5:48)
to like realize what show you're (5:46 - 5:50)
watching decided to play it might have (5:48 - 5:53)
been no it was a Johto episode sorry yes (5:50 - 5:55)
cuz I remember the amazing Giotto theme (5:53 - 5:58)
song and Brock is back as well as misty (5:55 - 6:01)
it was the Chikorita episode none of (5:58 - 6:03)
that matters what matters is one the (6:01 - 6:07)
johto theme song is amazing and two the (6:03 - 6:10)
animation is so bad in that season the (6:07 - 6:12)
lines I thought you didn't care about (6:10 - 6:15)
animation I don't yeah I don't like I (6:12 - 6:18)
would I would watch nori man you're (6:15 - 6:20)
right you're absolutely right like I (6:18 - 6:21)
don't know why you're trying to troll me (6:20 - 6:22)
you're absolutely right I'm just saying (6:21 - 6:25)
that I can recognize bad animation just (6:22 - 6:27)
like I could go to an art museum and (6:25 - 6:29)
recognize good and bad art but anyways (6:27 - 6:32)
the animation was so bad I didn't (6:29 - 6:35)
realize how it aged that being said that (6:32 - 6:37)
didn't stop me from watching the episode (6:35 - 6:38)
and realizing that chikorita beat (6:37 - 6:41)
Charizard at some point that chikorita (6:38 - 6:42)
is a real trick Arita (6:41 - 6:45)
I think chikorita also be Pikachu that (6:42 - 6:47)
theme song is real good yeah it's the (6:45 - 6:49)
best of them all it's quite good second (6:47 - 6:51)

I didn't realize the second movie was (7:44 - 7:48)
called the power of one I just thought (7:46 - 7:50)
it was called Pokemon the movie 2000 (7:48 - 7:53)
Pokemon the movie 2000 the power of one (7:50 - 7:55)
that is actually the great subtitle (7:53 - 7:56)
deadlock (7:55 - 7:59)
I have no idea go for it now Travis is (7:56 - 8:03)
right yeah I'm never wrong I mean name (7:59 - 8:04)
one time I've ever been wrong on this (8:03 - 8:07)
show it's not like last week when I said (8:04 - 8:09)
you had to tap on all of the corsola and (8:07 - 8:11)
Luvdisc but I was completely wrong (8:09 - 8:12)
because you don't have to do that at all (8:11 - 8:14)
in Magikarp jump I've never been wrong (8:12 - 8:17)
did you find that out just by letting (8:14 - 8:18)
them pass and seeing what happened or (8:17 - 8:21)
didn't know someone in slack corrected (8:18 - 8:24)
me I can for who but someone did yeah (8:21 - 8:25)
we're just the spearhead of a giant (8:24 - 8:28)
internet brain that solves all riddles (8:25 - 8:30)
for us and then we speak out the answer (8:28 - 8:33)
good did you guys have a preferred movie (8:30 - 8:35)
out of those three oh I don't even (8:33 - 8:36)
remember what the third one he said was (8:35 - 8:40)
the anti one it's where I thought and I (8:36 - 8:42)
was Pokemon no Pokemon the movie 2000 is (8:40 - 8:46)
the lugia legendary birds and lugia so (8:42 - 8:49)
proud I mean the third movies kind of (8:46 - 8:51)
it's kind of weird that nth azad ABS oh (8:49 - 8:53)
yeah yep (8:51 - 8:58)
yeah dad daddy ante I mean Indo if I (8:53 - 8:59)
were to pick one to watch like today I (8:58 - 9:01)
would pick the first movie but I will (8:59 - 9:04)
admit that's purely out of nostalgia and (9:01 - 9:06)
know the fact that I know it the but (9:04 - 9:07)
like if (9:06 - 9:09)
I go to a Pokemon movie it's because I (9:07 - 9:11)
like it's sort of like a the first one (9:09 - 9:13)
is a bit of a comfort movie it's not (9:11 - 9:17)
necessarily like fantastic but if I were (9:13 - 9:18)
to pick one of those three where I was (9:17 - 9:20)
like where I wanted to see one that I (9:18 - 9:23)
don't remember very well I would (9:20 - 9:25)
probably pick the Entei one because the (9:23 - 9:26)
only thing I remember about it is the (9:25 - 9:28)
Entei is the little girl's dad and (9:26 - 9:30)
that's weird and I would want to know (9:28 - 9:31)
how that happened (9:30 - 9:33)
because I don't remember it shows up at (9:31 - 9:36)
the end somewhere in that ends a movie (9:33 - 9:39)
yeah I've only ever seen the first one (9:36 - 9:40)
so I would watch either of the other two (9:39 - 9:43)
how have you not seen the other Pokemon (9:40 - 9:45)
movies though those were all in theaters (9:43 - 9:48)
well yeah when I was 27 and I was doing (9:45 - 9:51)
adult things and not being that creepy (9:48 - 9:53)
27 year old going to the Pokemon movie (9:51 - 9:59)
this is off BGR comm meet pokey land the (9:53 - 10:01)
latest Pokemon app for iOS and Android (9:59 - 10:04)
and the month since I you're gonna say (10:01 - 10:07)
there's gonna be like a pokemon park at (10:04 - 10:09)
Disney World or something and I got all (10:07 - 10:13)
excited yeah now this is uh this is the (10:09 - 10:16)
Pokemon Rumble spin-off and the months (10:13 - 10:18)
since Pokemon goes launch in the App (10:16 - 10:19)
Store and Google Play the Pokemon (10:18 - 10:20)
company has released two other mobile (10:19 - 10:23)
games Pokemon duel and Pokemon Magikarp (10:20 - 10:26)
jump the trend continues on Wednesday (10:23 - 10:27)
when the Pokemon company announced yet (10:26 - 10:30)
another Pokemon app called pokey land in (10:27 - 10:32)
pokey land players will collect toy (10:30 - 10:34)
versions of their favorite Pokemon and (10:32 - 10:35)
battle throughout a series of islands in (10:34 - 10:38)
attempt to reach the top of champion (10:35 - 10:40)
tower all in all this basically sounds (10:38 - 10:41)
like a mobile version of the Pokemon (10:40 - 10:43)
Rumble series which features many of the (10:41 - 10:46)
same elements including the way it looks (10:43 - 10:48)
at least that's my opinion including the (10:46 - 10:49)
way it looks (10:48 - 10:51)
according to the Japanese website pokey (10:49 - 10:53)
land requires an internet connection and (10:51 - 10:55)
links up with your Nintendo account (10:53 - 10:57)
which will allow you to bring your me (10:55 - 11:00)
into the game I believe this is the (10:57 - 11:04)
first Pokemon game that connects via (11:00 - 11:08)
your Nintendo account as you battle your (11:04 - 11:10)
way through the island you will also (11:08 - 11:12)
find gear that will let you strength (11:10 - 11:14)
strengthen your toy Pokemon team (11:12 - 11:17)
starting today Android owners in Japan (11:14 - 11:19)
will have the opportunity to participate (11:17 - 11:21)
in a limited alpha (11:19 - 11:23)
this test will feature six islands fifty (11:21 - 11:25)
two stages 134 different kinds of (11:23 - 11:27)
Pokemon testers will also be able to (11:25 - 11:29)
climb the tower to the fifteenth floor (11:27 - 11:31)
which will be even taller in the final (11:29 - 11:33)
game players who participate in the (11:31 - 11:34)
alpha test won't be able to transfer the (11:33 - 11:36)
progress over to the final game the (11:34 - 11:38)
Alpha ends on June 9th there's no word (11:36 - 11:41)
yet if the game will come to the US that (11:38 - 11:43)
said Pokemon Rumble and Magikarp of the (11:41 - 11:45)
original Pokemon Rumble and Magikarp (11:43 - 11:47)
jump made it over here so pokey land (11:45 - 11:48)
will probably do the same (11:47 - 11:52)
yeah Pokemon Rumble world you were able (11:48 - 11:54)
to have a me but I'm not sure if it was (11:52 - 11:58)
the same me as your Nintendo me if you (11:54 - 12:00)
know what I'm saying oh yeah yeah I (11:58 - 12:01)
think they mean first mobile game (12:00 - 12:04)
because obviously Me's are on 3ds so (12:01 - 12:07)
anybody could access that API and put me (12:04 - 12:10)
into their game so here's the important (12:07 - 12:14)
thing Ken I take my outfits from miitomo (12:10 - 12:17)
which I have a huge selection of outfits (12:14 - 12:20)
of various glory and and use them in (12:17 - 12:23)
this new game I don't predict oh yeah I (12:20 - 12:24)
don't think so (12:23 - 12:28)
what other Nintendo so miitomo obviously (12:24 - 12:32)
accesses your me I'm pretty sure Super (12:28 - 12:35)
Mario run accesses your me you're (12:32 - 12:38)
talking just mobile games yeah just ios (12:35 - 12:40)
and android games v does Fire Emblem (12:38 - 12:42)
access you're me (12:40 - 12:44)
not that I know of I don't think so (12:42 - 12:46)
either unless it unless you can use it (12:44 - 12:49)
as like an avatar but I don't think so (12:46 - 12:51)
but even if it doesn't access hear me (12:49 - 12:55)
when you log into I was gonna say Club (12:51 - 12:56)
Nintendo but it's not called that (12:55 - 12:59)
anymore when you log into nintendo.com (12:56 - 13:02)
and then go to the rewards section there (12:59 - 13:04)
are rewards for both Super Mario run and (13:02 - 13:08)
for Fire Emblem and miitomo I don't even (13:04 - 13:09)
know what they're called but you can get (13:08 - 13:11)
like items in the game by spending your (13:09 - 13:13)
coins Fire Emblem you could get like a (13:11 - 13:16)
fruit like you get five free orbs just (13:13 - 13:18)
by logging into Nintendo calm and then (13:16 - 13:21)
redeeming it and then you could get like (13:18 - 13:23)
another two orbs for like 200 coins or (13:21 - 13:23)
something (13:23 - 13:26)
so if pokey land is also accessing your (13:23 - 13:28)
Nintendo account which no other iOS or (13:26 - 13:31)
Android mobile game does I'm sure there (13:28 - 13:32)
would be some something tied in to (13:31 - 13:34)
Nintendo calm (13:32 - 13:37)
if with your coins my guess is that this (13:34 - 13:39)
game isn't going to be too great I mean (13:37 - 13:42)
was any rumble series game really like (13:39 - 13:44)
that great they were nice I mean that (13:42 - 13:46)
that's kind of what I'm saying because (13:44 - 13:49)
Pokemon Rumble can be fun I think but (13:46 - 13:52)
and there are some of those games that I (13:49 - 13:56)
do like but I think anyone who even (13:52 - 13:57)
anyone who really likes Pokemon Rumble (13:56 - 14:01)
would admit that the gameplay is pretty (13:57 - 14:05)
simple to your general Pokemon Rumble (14:01 - 14:09)
experience and we were taking a concept (14:05 - 14:13)
that's already quite simple like doesn't (14:09 - 14:15)
have a lot of depth to it and then (14:13 - 14:17)
making a mobile version of that it's (14:15 - 14:21)
probably even simpler to the point of my (14:17 - 14:25)
guess would be not it wouldn't be that (14:21 - 14:28)
great but we'll see I mean I I played a (14:25 - 14:30)
heck of a lot of Pokemon Rumble worlds (14:28 - 14:34)
that's good free to start one will on (14:30 - 14:38)
the 3ds yeah well I mean you never had (14:34 - 14:40)
to put money into it but you could play (14:38 - 14:41)
the whole thing without putting money (14:40 - 14:43)
into it but it was just like you could (14:41 - 14:46)
only get so far so fast (14:43 - 14:50)
um but Steve you were my king in that (14:46 - 14:53)
game as I should have been I mean that (14:50 - 14:57)
was fun and uh I mean I can see how it (14:53 - 14:59)
can move that that's an easy move to (14:57 - 15:02)
mobile because like the Pokemon don't do (14:59 - 15:06)
that much so it's easily you know just (15:02 - 15:09)
tapping on the screen is easy enough to (15:06 - 15:11)
translate the moves and stuff into if (15:09 - 15:14)
they maintain the same mechanics here's (15:11 - 15:15)
a question for both of you because you (15:14 - 15:18)
both like Rumble or Rumble to some (15:15 - 15:20)
extent and I will say that my favorite (15:18 - 15:23)
Rumble is the one on Wii U because it (15:20 - 15:26)
had multiplayer and it had the one the (15:23 - 15:28)
wannabe amiibos which I thought were (15:26 - 15:30)
just charming in their own right but (15:28 - 15:33)
that being said question is does it (15:30 - 15:37)
upset you or the opposite of does it (15:33 - 15:39)
were excite you I guess upset or excite (15:37 - 15:42)
you that down set me it does it down set (15:39 - 15:45)
you that they took what has always been (15:42 - 15:48)
a console / handheld (15:45 - 15:51)
choice and now pushed it into mobile I (15:48 - 15:53)
know they've got to make money (15:51 - 15:56)
then yeah I'm pretty diversify folks I'm (15:53 - 15:59)
pretty down set about it aye aye (15:56 - 16:02)
I mean they've done like the fact that (15:59 - 16:04)
they did with that with Fire Emblem and (16:02 - 16:08)
I hadn't played Fire Emblem before makes (16:04 - 16:10)
me want like they did that with Fire (16:08 - 16:12)
Emblem and I had never played it before (16:10 - 16:15)
and now I want to buy the new game when (16:12 - 16:18)
it comes out on switch so like I'm proof (16:15 - 16:21)
that that's a pretty good strategy so (16:18 - 16:24)
I'm very down set about it so so Steve (16:21 - 16:27)
have you ever heard of Willy Sutton no (16:24 - 16:30)
as it sounds like a country music star (16:27 - 16:34)
and incorrect Willy Sutton it was a bank (16:30 - 16:37)
robber in the early 20th century early (16:34 - 16:40)
1900s and he's particularly famous (16:37 - 16:44)
because he was caught and somebody asked (16:40 - 16:48)
him Willy why do you rob banks and his (16:44 - 16:51)
answer was because that is where the (16:48 - 16:51)
money is (16:51 - 16:56)
so yes I expect T PCI to make mobile (16:51 - 16:58)
games because guess what that is where (16:56 - 16:59)
the money is (16:58 - 17:09)
yeah to make money I think what Steve is (16:59 - 17:13)
saying is like in a perfect world like (17:09 - 17:17)
where like like week we all recognize (17:13 - 17:19)
that there's a lot of money in the (17:17 - 17:22)
mobile app market I don't think anyone's (17:19 - 17:23)
contesting that I think what Steve is (17:22 - 17:26)
saying a lot easy money if if the (17:23 - 17:30)
incentives were or different if you know (17:26 - 17:32)
like if it were an even choice between (17:30 - 17:36)
making a mobile game or making a 3ds (17:32 - 17:39)
game and they made a mobile game would (17:36 - 17:42)
that upset you or DOM is that guy go (17:39 - 17:44)
I've got I've got both I guess I'm down (17:42 - 17:47)
set yeah I mean I have no turtle in this (17:44 - 17:51)
aquarium but I was just I was just (17:47 - 17:53)
curious what you what you both thought (17:51 - 17:56)
that being said clearly the mobile game (17:53 - 17:59)
thing has worked for them and I think (17:56 - 18:00)
that's fine (17:59 - 18:03)
who's buying who's buying the rumble (18:00 - 18:05)
games like I would I would have to (18:03 - 18:08)
imagine out of the games they have sold (18:05 - 18:11)
whether that's pokemon snap or pokemon (18:08 - 18:15)
stadium or pokemon - or poképark i would (18:11 - 18:17)
wager to bet that the pokemon rumble (18:15 - 18:20)
games are probably on the lower end of (18:17 - 18:22)
sales compared to the other spin-off (18:20 - 18:23)
games (18:22 - 18:27)
so when mmm there are some people who (18:23 - 18:30)
really like the rumble games it's (18:27 - 18:32)
because they're more like action II than (18:30 - 18:35)
your typical Pokemon game yeah but (18:32 - 18:38)
actually you mean like you mean spamming (18:35 - 18:41)
the a button yeah like you could (18:38 - 18:43)
probably - do you brother play through (18:41 - 18:44)
that whole game without looking at the (18:43 - 18:47)
screen and just mashing a now you kind (18:44 - 18:50)
of aim you gotta aim the Pokemon - but (18:47 - 18:52)
it has to like walk around and go places (18:50 - 18:55)
I'm only I'm only one person out of you (18:52 - 18:57)
know millions of Pokemon fans but I (18:55 - 19:00)
played one Rumble game and I got the (18:57 - 19:02)
gist of it and they haven't really (19:00 - 19:04)
changed that formula since so it always (19:02 - 19:07)
made it very troubling for me well see (19:04 - 19:09)
formulating or retelling is a well (19:07 - 19:12)
established to pay like thirty nine (19:09 - 19:15)
dollars for the 3ds one which I can't (19:12 - 19:17)
believe that game came out at full price (19:15 - 19:19)
for what it was hey there was a lot of (19:17 - 19:21)
story at net game I think that we I (19:19 - 19:22)
think the Wii U one was which was (19:21 - 19:25)
digital only was twenty and that one (19:22 - 19:27)
that one had to have done the worst just (19:25 - 19:30)
based on the Wii U's install base and (19:27 - 19:33)
then they did the free one on 3ds which (19:30 - 19:36)
probably made them a decent amount of (19:33 - 19:39)
money or maybe not but clearly they made (19:36 - 19:42)
some sort of money to make now this one (19:39 - 19:46)
hey remember Pokemon Conquest yeah what (19:42 - 19:48)
we're talking about they're not that (19:46 - 19:51)
game so good actually I wonder this this (19:48 - 19:54)
is actually what I wondered now is they (19:51 - 19:57)
released Pokemon shuffle on 3ds and then (19:54 - 19:59)
they eventually moved it over to Android (19:57 - 20:03)
and 3ds alright Android and iOS iPhone I (19:59 - 20:05)
wonder if shuffle started making way (20:03 - 20:08)
more money on iOS than it did on 3ds and (20:05 - 20:11)
so they saw that and because both Rumble (20:08 - 20:14)
and shuffle were free on 3ds (20:11 - 20:17)
they were they thought oh let's move it (20:14 - 20:19)
over to I Oh s and Android because that (20:17 - 20:23)
is where people are more likely to spend (20:19 - 20:25)
money than on 3ds I don't know what your (20:23 - 20:27)
what you're telling me is we're gonna (20:25 - 20:30)
get a face Raiders port yes made by the (20:27 - 20:33)
Pokemon only and the only face you see (20:30 - 20:37)
is bass Cohen's you I would I'd play (20:33 - 20:41)
that for a minute I prefer it was like (20:37 - 20:43)
Reggie's face or something speaking of (20:41 - 20:46)
money it was everyone's favorite Pokemon (20:43 - 20:50)
Reggie fils-aime a yep he only says his (20:46 - 20:54)
name this is off the verge calm knee (20:50 - 20:57)
antic earns up to 50 cents per visit to (20:54 - 21:00)
sponsored Pokemon go stops that's a lot (20:57 - 21:03)
of money hot dang hot yeah we're gonna (21:00 - 21:04)
we're gonna get it (21:03 - 21:06)
speaking of money Travis we're gonna (21:04 - 21:07)
we're gonna go deep (21:06 - 21:10)
wowsers I've always said money is no (21:07 - 21:12)
good in the bank the antic is surely (21:10 - 21:15)
proving that point knee antic is making (21:12 - 21:17)
lots of money off sponsor Pokemon go (21:15 - 21:19)
stops and particularly crashed out (21:17 - 21:21)
during the height of the game's (21:19 - 21:23)
popularity last year interviews with (21:21 - 21:26)
Brazil's global paper and TechCrunch (21:23 - 21:29)
knee antic said that it charges anywhere (21:26 - 21:32)
from 15 cents to 50 cents for each (21:29 - 21:35)
visitor that the game draws to a (21:32 - 21:37)
sponsored location there's some (21:35 - 21:39)
uncertainty about the exact cost of a (21:37 - 21:42)
visit but the figures imply that in the (21:39 - 21:43)
antic could be making millions of (21:42 - 21:46)
dollars off players the antics VP of (21:43 - 21:49)
strategic partnerships matthew de fête (21:46 - 21:54)
told global Globo sorry that its (21:49 - 21:56)
partners pay 15 cents for every visitor (21:54 - 21:58)
and the company has already attracted (21:56 - 22:00)
fifty five hundred million visitors (21:58 - 22:02)
around the world every activated (22:00 - 22:04)
McDonald's store in Japan attracts two (22:02 - 22:07)
thousand visitors a day he says when (22:04 - 22:09)
TechCrunch double-checked those numbers (22:07 - 22:10)
with the company in the antics said it (22:09 - 22:13)
was actually a antics said that in (22:10 - 22:16)
actuality sponsorships cost up to fifty (22:13 - 22:18)
percent per unique visit using fee (22:16 - 22:21)
eighths fifteen cent pricing and his (22:18 - 22:24)
five hundred million visitors figure (22:21 - 22:26)
that could translate to seventy five (22:24 - 22:28)
million dollars in revenue at fifty (22:26 - 22:31)
per visit that revenue would jump up to (22:28 - 22:34)
250 million in December in the antic (22:31 - 22:36)
announced that it was partnering with (22:34 - 22:39)
Starbucks who turned 7800 stores across (22:36 - 22:41)
the u.s. into pokey stops or gyms that (22:39 - 22:44)
deal coincided with the debut of Pokemon (22:41 - 22:47)
go themed Frappuccino which was designed (22:44 - 22:51)
to entice players spirit is also (22:47 - 22:53)
offering a partnership with the antic to (22:51 - 22:53)
turn (22:53 - 22:57)
oh sorry sprint is also offering a (22:53 - 22:58)
partnership with the antique to turn (22:57 - 23:01)
10,000 stores into gyms and pokey stops (22:58 - 23:03)
it isn't clear how popular the game is (23:01 - 23:06)
following its viral release in the (23:03 - 23:06)
summer (23:06 - 23:09)
stop this article to say that as of last (23:06 - 23:11)
night it was number 19 in the top (23:09 - 23:14)
grossing apps in iOS but still over the (23:11 - 23:16)
past few months Niantic has launched new (23:14 - 23:18)
Pokemon debuted the game on the Apple (23:16 - 23:20)
watch expanded into new markets Pokemon (23:18 - 23:22)
goes publisher the Pokemon company says (23:20 - 23:23)
the following release of game freak's (23:22 - 23:27)
Pokemon Sun and Moon its profits profits (23:23 - 23:28)
rose to one hundred and forty three (23:27 - 23:31)
point three million nearly twenty six (23:28 - 23:33)
times the profit it made the previous (23:31 - 23:35)
year clearly neither in the antic or the (23:33 - 23:37)
Pokemon company are going to let Pokemon (23:35 - 23:39)
go die yet especially if everyone's (23:37 - 23:42)
still profiting big time alright so (23:39 - 23:45)
before you comment on this I have off of (23:42 - 23:50)
second Toto calm Pokemon company's (23:45 - 23:53)
profits they couldn't get they couldn't (23:50 - 23:58)
NAB first todo so they're thinking NAB (23:53 - 24:02)
that that VIP URL that premium URL I (23:58 - 24:05)
don't think so yeah I don't think so so (24:02 - 24:09)
the Pokemon company has 1919 fiscal (24:05 - 24:10)
years in its history (24:09 - 24:14)
so number 19 is the year of Pokemon Sun (24:10 - 24:18)
and Pokemon go and Pokemon moon so we'll (24:14 - 24:19)
just start with their fifteenth fiscal (24:18 - 24:22)
year here they made a sixteen point six (24:19 - 24:26)
million dollars of of net profit right (24:22 - 24:28)
correct because that would be very very (24:26 - 24:31)
small if it were gross yeah net profit (24:28 - 24:34)
their sixteenth year they made ten point (24:31 - 24:38)
six million dollars their 17th fiscal (24:34 - 24:40)
year eighteen point four million dollars (24:38 - 24:41)
their (24:40 - 24:44)
18th physical year always stressed that (24:41 - 24:47)
this is no game no main series game this (24:44 - 24:51)
year 5.6 million and their 19th year is (24:47 - 24:54)
a hundred and forty three point three (24:51 - 24:57)
million so let me just well well let me (24:54 - 24:59)
just go through this is one time fifteen (24:57 - 25:02)
fifteenth year 16 million sixteenth year (24:59 - 25:04)
10 million seventeenth year 18 million (25:02 - 25:07)
eighteenth year five million this last (25:04 - 25:11)
year a hundred and forty three million (25:07 - 25:13)
they can finally get those gold-plated (25:11 - 25:15)
toilet seats in the executive bathroom (25:13 - 25:20)
wait not even gold-plated just gold hmm (25:15 - 25:24)
gold and silver no what's a silver (25:20 - 25:27)
toilet seat very cool it's a lot of (25:24 - 25:29)
money is the thing with over a hundred (25:27 - 25:32)
sixty million debt like how is the (25:29 - 25:36)
majority of that boost from Pokemon go (25:32 - 25:38)
or did Pokemon like I don't know that (25:36 - 25:41)
much about financial performance of the (25:38 - 25:43)
of the main series of Pokemon games I (25:41 - 25:46)
just like them and play them a lot did (25:43 - 25:48)
Sun and Moon do considerably better than (25:46 - 25:53)
for example X&Y or is that jump just (25:48 - 25:56)
because Pokemon go came out I can pull (25:53 - 25:59)
up the sales numbers but I do know that (25:56 - 26:01)
the last time I checked (25:59 - 26:04)
Sun and Moon were geared to pass the (26:01 - 26:09)
sales of x and y but were in the same (26:04 - 26:11)
ballpark so it must just that difference (26:09 - 26:13)
must just be Pokemon go then (26:11 - 26:16)
wowsers people really do like that poky (26:13 - 26:19)
bug thing on the phones (26:16 - 26:24)
hokey bug polka bugs you go out poke at (26:19 - 26:27)
your phone you get the polka bugs Oh a (26:24 - 26:30)
Pokemon girl so what do you tat one okay (26:27 - 26:33)
so Sun and Moon came out so there was no (26:30 - 26:36)
game in the no main series game in the (26:33 - 26:39)
year they made 5 million and then the (26:36 - 26:43)
year before that was Omega Ruby alpha (26:39 - 26:46)
sapphire the year before that was X&Y (26:43 - 26:50)
and then the the first fifth the first (26:46 - 26:53)
year I read off the 15 fiscal year was (26:50 - 26:55)
pokemon black and white 2 (26:53 - 27:00)
and then in 2011 there was no game I (26:55 - 27:03)
guess I mean there was but I'm looking (27:00 - 27:05)
at the Japanese dates here so that being (27:03 - 27:10)
said if you look I think (27:05 - 27:12)
I think it's obvious that Pokemon go had (27:10 - 27:16)
probably the biggest impact as well as (27:12 - 27:19)
it being their 20th anniversary so I (27:16 - 27:21)
think we also got poked in this that (27:19 - 27:24)
year we also got Pokemon shuffle on iOS (27:21 - 27:27)
we also got what else did we get (27:24 - 27:30)
sorry we got those monthly Pokemon (27:27 - 27:31)
distributions too like Toys R Us and (27:30 - 27:35)
Game Stop and and everything thus they (27:31 - 27:37)
did the whole twitch thing for two days (27:35 - 27:38)
of all the pokemon movies so they did a (27:37 - 27:40)
lot of things last year and that's (27:38 - 27:42)
that's kind of why I've been a little (27:40 - 27:44)
frustrated recently because I haven't (27:42 - 27:46)
really done anything this year I mean (27:44 - 27:48)
Magikarp jump in Pokemon duel and (27:46 - 27:50)
everything but they haven't done (27:48 - 27:54)
anything big yet which it blows my mind (27:50 - 27:56)
that look at how successful they were (27:54 - 27:58)
last year and they're letting I feel (27:56 - 28:00)
like they're just letting that fall off (27:58 - 28:02)
they're leaving the money on the table (28:00 - 28:07)
so so 2015 weeding any game so is that (28:02 - 28:09)
where is that where Pokemon Z was (28:07 - 28:11)
supposed to be that has to be it right (28:09 - 28:16)
yeah perhaps they're looking at that (28:11 - 28:18)
perhaps that they're looking at that (28:16 - 28:24)
huge jump in profits and saying holy cow (28:18 - 28:28)
holy cow something something changed (28:24 - 28:30)
here that's something being Pokemon go (28:28 - 28:33)
that was a like a bit of an experiment (28:30 - 28:39)
on our parts and it paid off a lot so (28:33 - 28:42)
maybe we should take we should redirect (28:39 - 28:44)
our efforts a little bit to try and (28:42 - 28:48)
create some more projects that are (28:44 - 28:51)
similar to that so maybe this year (28:48 - 28:54)
they're spending more of their efforts (28:51 - 28:56)
like brainstorming not like (28:54 - 28:58)
brainstorming but like launching new (28:56 - 29:00)
projects and stuff so that's why we're (28:58 - 29:03)
not seeing much cut like coming out this (29:00 - 29:05)
year because probably caught them by (29:03 - 29:07)
surprise how much Pokemon go made them (29:05 - 29:09)
and they're like wow okay I think I (29:07 - 29:10)
caught everyone by surprise (29:09 - 29:13)
yeah so I so I guess what I'm saying is (29:10 - 29:15)
it would be conceivable that this (29:13 - 29:19)
strategy is we had no idea how great the (29:15 - 29:22)
strategy would turn out for us let's try (29:19 - 29:22)
to (29:22 - 29:25)
similar project so maybe they're like in (29:22 - 29:28)
the planning stages of similar things I (29:25 - 29:29)
mean that's pure conjecture on my part (29:28 - 29:32)
but it would make sense right yeah no (29:29 - 29:33)
that makes sense (29:32 - 29:36)
so they're seventeen fiscal year is when (29:33 - 29:39)
Omega Ruby alpha sapphire came out that (29:36 - 29:40)
was more or less a worldwide release (29:39 - 29:43)
that was the year they made 18 million (29:40 - 29:46)
and then the year after they made 5.6 (29:43 - 29:49)
million obvious like Nabi not obviously (29:46 - 29:54)
but but obviously another team was (29:49 - 29:56)
working on Pokemon Z or had to be (29:54 - 30:00)
working on something of the sort because (29:56 - 30:05)
as a company if you're guaranteeing so (30:00 - 30:07)
II there were seer which was out of out (30:05 - 30:09)
of these years which was their 16th (30:07 - 30:12)
fiscal year which was the year before (30:09 - 30:16)
that was the year before Omega Ruby (30:12 - 30:18)
alpha sapphire that's when they did (30:16 - 30:20)
Pokemon (30:18 - 30:24)
X&Y they made ten million and I don't (30:20 - 30:26)
know how their years exactly roll over (30:24 - 30:29)
so that doesn't matter too much but even (30:26 - 30:31)
if that was their worst a year at ten (30:29 - 30:33)
million and you look at the 18th fiscal (30:31 - 30:37)
year of no game they could have made 5 (30:33 - 30:40)
million in net profit at least if they (30:37 - 30:43)
would have released Z and yet for some (30:40 - 30:45)
reason they didn't yeah so when I was (30:43 - 30:49)
talking to people in slack Nick kind of (30:45 - 30:52)
made a good point of if they if they (30:49 - 30:55)
missed that deadline of November or (30:52 - 30:56)
whenever they were supposed to release (30:55 - 30:59)
it if they couldn't finish it in time (30:56 - 31:01)
and they missed it and they were gearing (30:59 - 31:03)
up for this 20th anniversary which (31:01 - 31:07)
included Sun and Moon you just can't (31:03 - 31:10)
release Z anymore it's not like you're (31:07 - 31:11)
gonna release Z in March and then all of (31:10 - 31:13)
a sudden release Sun and Moon in (31:11 - 31:16)
November which is what they did because (31:13 - 31:20)
they announced Sun and Moon in March so (31:16 - 31:21)
you're not gonna go oh here's Pokemon Z (31:20 - 31:23)
by the way there's another Pokemon game (31:21 - 31:24)
coming out because people are either (31:23 - 31:26)
going to go do - well you're either you (31:24 - 31:28)
have the people that buy anything (31:26 - 31:30)
Pokemon related like the three of us or (31:28 - 31:33)
you have people that are very content (31:30 - 31:36)
with just one game every now and then (31:33 - 31:37)
whether that's oh I bought (31:36 - 31:38)
black-and-white but I'm not gonna buy (31:37 - 31:41)
black and white - oh I bought X&Y but (31:38 - 31:43)
I'm not going to buy Omega Ruby alpha (31:41 - 31:45)
sapphire oh I guess I'm getting Z so I I (31:43 - 31:48)
don't need Sun and Moon or in Reverse oh (31:45 - 31:50)
set of moons coming out and that's a (31:48 - 31:51)
whole new game and it has all new (31:50 - 31:54)
Pokemon why would I go back to Kalos I (31:51 - 31:57)
just think it's very interesting what (31:54 - 31:58)
you're saying makes sense it does make (31:57 - 32:02)
sense it's just I mean I hope all those (31:58 - 32:04)
people have been fired if their planning (32:02 - 32:05)
was that poor and their ability to (32:04 - 32:08)
deliver on time was that bad that they (32:05 - 32:10)
missed out on an entire game and that's (32:08 - 32:12)
how I got fired by the Pokemon company (32:10 - 32:16)
and Game Freak yeah I'm just so curious (32:12 - 32:19)
of what happened there because it's not (32:16 - 32:21)
like Z would have been a failure it (32:19 - 32:24)
would have netted them five million (32:21 - 32:26)
dollars and I don't think any company's (32:24 - 32:27)
gonna scoff at (32:26 - 32:30)
oh don't worry guys we'll make - yeah (32:27 - 32:32)
we'll be okay with five million dollars (32:30 - 32:33)
this year but hey if we would release (32:32 - 32:36)
that game we would have been at least at (32:33 - 32:38)
least ten billion dollars that's so much (32:36 - 32:41)
more money its net profit that means (32:38 - 32:43)
that was after they paid for everything (32:41 - 32:45)
that's a net profit of five more million (32:43 - 32:49)
dollars not guaranteed you're right it's (32:45 - 32:51)
not guaranteed they safety not (32:49 - 32:53)
guaranteed they could have sold nothing (32:51 - 32:56)
I just think those numbers are very (32:53 - 33:00)
interesting after like yeah you can look (32:56 - 33:02)
at the 146 million go wow that's that's (33:00 - 33:06)
that's that's unbelievable (33:02 - 33:08)
I think that five million dollar numbers (33:06 - 33:11)
way more interesting than the then that (33:08 - 33:14)
146 million dollar number because we (33:11 - 33:17)
were alive and we were outside and we (33:14 - 33:20)
were in the deep end of the aquarium (33:17 - 33:24)
when Pokemon go hit that's all I got I (33:20 - 33:25)
don't know what any of those words mean (33:24 - 33:29)
so sure I think that was our last news (33:25 - 33:31)
so this is the part where like music (33:29 - 33:34)
comes in and we take a break right yeah (33:31 - 33:35)

check the list it says the list will be (35:21 - 35:26)

Pachirisu and a mimic you and a munchlax (35:32 - 35:38)
munchlax sorry so those are clearly or (35:34 - 35:40)
not probably none of whom will get used (35:38 - 35:44)
maybe mimic you ah picture issue has the (35:40 - 35:47)
what follow me that's pretty popular no (35:44 - 35:52)
duh so someone on one of the so there's (35:47 - 35:53)
a competitive battling subreddit called (35:52 - 35:56)
stunfisk (35:53 - 36:00)
someone on that subreddit that is user (35:56 - 36:07)
super GST er 17 made a post that is a (36:00 - 36:10)
link to a Google Doc spreadsheet that (36:07 - 36:14)
has all of the pokémon that are under a (36:10 - 36:18)
meter tall organized by all their base (36:14 - 36:20)
stats anyone want to hazard a guess as (36:18 - 36:23)
to what what pokemon has the highest (36:20 - 36:26)
base stat total under a meter is it (36:23 - 36:27)
cortana is it me (36:26 - 36:31)
no music bait using someone mu is also (36:27 - 36:33)
mu is also mythical so it's not included (36:31 - 36:36)
car Tana is very close car Tana is (36:33 - 36:41)
number 4 on the list at 570 and it's (36:36 - 36:43)
unclear whether car Tana will be allowed (36:41 - 36:46)
as an ultra beast and it's also unclear (36:43 - 36:49)
and actually the 4 above it are all (36:46 - 36:51)
unclear for various reasons the three (36:49 - 36:54)
above it are as L Fuchs E and mass prett (36:51 - 36:57)
each at 580 unclear whether that will be (36:54 - 36:58)
allowed because we don't know which (36:57 - 37:00)
legendary Pokemon will be allowed (36:58 - 37:03)
although I believe they will be because (37:00 - 37:04)
I don't think they've been banned and (37:03 - 37:06)
things in the past and then number one (37:04 - 37:10)
is also dubious because it's wishy-washy (37:06 - 37:13)
school form and it really depends on if (37:10 - 37:16)
they count the height of school form or (37:13 - 37:20)
the height of what is though just a lone (37:16 - 37:21)
wishy-washy called I don't remember (37:20 - 37:24)
where she just wishy-washy uno uno (37:21 - 37:26)
wishy-washy is what you have she so I (37:24 - 37:29)
have to figure out if they allow (37:26 - 37:31)
wishy-washy school for him but (37:29 - 37:35)
discounting those by 6 which are all (37:31 - 37:37)
dubious for various reasons the next (37:35 - 37:40)
highest one is porygon Z and number 7 (37:37 - 37:43)
535 based at total wouldn't you would (37:40 - 37:45)
just put porygon 2 there and give it an (37:43 - 37:49)
an Evo light I mean you would but just (37:45 - 37:52)
for pure statistics take say sure that (37:49 - 37:54)
is the yeah why is pouring on to better (37:52 - 37:56)
than poor Ganzi because the ability not (37:54 - 38:00)
just because porygon 2 already has like (37:56 - 38:03)
porygon z when you evolve into porygon z (38:00 - 38:04)
it doesn't really gain much other than (38:03 - 38:07)
offensive capability so considering that (38:04 - 38:09)
you've already got decent bulk on (38:07 - 38:10)
porygon 2 (38:09 - 38:12)
and then slap on an EVO light and that (38:10 - 38:15)
decent book gets even better and it has (38:12 - 38:18)
a great supporting move pool a better (38:15 - 38:19)
supporting move pool honestly than it (38:18 - 38:21)
does offensive although there are some (38:19 - 38:24)
pretty decent things you can do with (38:21 - 38:28)
porygon Z and like singles do well that (38:24 - 38:31)
tournament starts like I said on June (38:28 - 38:35)
23rd registration starting on June 14th (38:31 - 38:37)
so nine days when this episode goes up (38:35 - 38:40)
and that is our last bit of news so what (38:37 - 38:41)
we'll do is we will take a quick break (38:40 - 38:44)
and we come back we will do emails and (38:41 - 38:47)
Pokemon of the week (38:44 - 38:47)
[Music] (38:47 - 39:00)

calling Washington DC the D how is the (39:46 - 39:52)
district well yeah it was pleasant until (39:50 - 39:55)
my air conditioning broke and now it's a (39:52 - 39:57)
little roasty-toasty Oh like let me tell (39:55 - 39:58)
you I can't live without air (39:57 - 40:04)

starting this week the week this podcast (40:04 - 40:11)
goes up I am starting a new podcast (40:07 - 40:15)
believe it or not a Pokemon related (40:11 - 40:19)
podcast so I am starting a another (40:15 - 40:22)
Pokemon podcast in all attempts to (40:19 - 40:25)
finally get rid of Travis and will huh (40:22 - 40:27)
yeah it's taking you a while but you've (40:25 - 40:27)
finally done it (40:27 - 40:30)
finally it is going to be a new podcast (40:27 - 40:32)
completely focused on the Pokemon anime (40:30 - 40:36)
and we will be starting we as in it will (40:32 - 40:39)
be a show featuring myself and Irene (40:36 - 40:41)
we're gonna be starting with that's fun (40:39 - 40:44)
and cute that's it that's nice we're (40:41 - 40:46)
gonna be starting with season 20 so Sun (40:44 - 40:48)
and Moon and we're gonna be doing one (40:46 - 40:50)
Episode a week of the Sun and Moon anime (40:48 - 40:53)
the first two weeks you will get bonus (40:50 - 40:56)
episodes as we try to quickly catch up (40:53 - 40:58)
to the current episode which is episode (40:56 - 41:02)
12 as of this recording so doing a Sun a (40:58 - 41:06)
moon anime so the catch to this podcast (41:02 - 41:09)
is it will be only for patreon backers (41:06 - 41:12)
at the four dollar a month level so if (41:09 - 41:14)
you're donating one dollar a month and (41:12 - 41:16)
you are interested you would have to up (41:14 - 41:17)
that to four dollars a month which is (41:16 - 41:19)
which really just comes down to a dollar (41:17 - 41:22)
a week this has no effect on it's super (41:19 - 41:23)
effective it's super effective we'll (41:22 - 41:25)
still come out every Monday will still (41:23 - 41:27)
always be free all that jazz that I've (41:25 - 41:29)
always talked about this is just some (41:27 - 41:31)
extra work that I'm doing to see if (41:29 - 41:33)
people are interested because I know (41:31 - 41:35)
that a lot of people do like the anime (41:33 - 41:38)
so patreon has a cool feature where it (41:35 - 41:41)
does allow podcasts to go through there (41:38 - 41:43)
so I will be uploading all the podcasts (41:41 - 41:45)
through patreon once you are a gold (41:43 - 41:46)
backer which is four dollars more a (41:45 - 41:48)
month or higher whether that's you know (41:46 - 41:51)
a hundred dollars a month or or six (41:48 - 41:54)
dollars a month it will give you an RSS (41:51 - 41:56)
feed once the first episode is live you (41:54 - 41:58)
after that RSS feed and your iTunes app (41:56 - 42:01)
or your Google Play app or your pod pod (41:58 - 42:05)
stitcher app podcaster pocket cast (42:01 - 42:06)
that's what I was thinking of your (42:05 - 42:10)
pocket cast app and then just like any (42:06 - 42:11)
RSS feed when new episodes come you (42:10 - 42:12)
don't have to worry about anything you (42:11 - 42:14)
don't blog into patreon it's just that (42:12 - 42:16)
initial login gets you that RSS feed and (42:14 - 42:19)
then you're good to go at least that's (42:16 - 42:20)
how I believe it works (42:19 - 42:21)
that's what patreon that's what (42:20 - 42:23)
everything I've read so hopefully that (42:21 - 42:26)
goes very smoothly so yeah that I will (42:23 - 42:27)
send a patreon post I'll post about it (42:26 - 42:29)
but if you're if you're interested in (42:27 - 42:31)
that and you want to upgrade to $4 cool (42:29 - 42:33)
if not if that's not for you also cool (42:31 - 42:36)
you still got it super effective so yeah (42:33 - 42:39)
I think that's all (42:36 - 42:41)
are you talking about the anime ah so (42:39 - 42:43)
with that big said let's uh let's tackle (42:41 - 42:48)
some Pokemon emails some emails here so (42:43 - 42:50)
they any questions comments or concerns (42:48 - 42:53)
you can send those over to SB j @p (42:50 - 42:56)
command cast comm or you can go to poll (42:53 - 42:58)
why don't we call them poke emails (42:56 - 43:01)
Hulk emails hmm that's really good we (42:58 - 43:03)
should do that couldn't you get emails (43:01 - 43:04)
and X&Y (43:03 - 43:07)
know you got like FaceTime calls yeah (43:04 - 43:09)
they were like 3d holographic video (43:07 - 43:13)
calls yep in in well in pokemon mystery (43:09 - 43:15)
dungeon you could attach letters to (43:13 - 43:16)
pokemon and then they would carry them (43:15 - 43:18)
around places for you they didn't have a (43:16 - 43:22)
clever name not the pokemon mystery yeah (43:18 - 43:23)
probably (43:22 - 43:26)
you also got a Pokemon podcast calm and (43:23 - 43:28)
hit contact can't hit the contact button (43:26 - 43:30)

send emails this is from Tom C Rochester (43:30 - 43:34)
New York (43:34 - 43:37)
hi guys I'm a fairly new listener and I (43:34 - 43:39)
really enjoy the podcast I got into the (43:37 - 43:41)
podcast via the Sun and Moon series I (43:39 - 43:44)
recently jumped back into Pokemon with (43:41 - 43:47)
moon after originally playing pokemon (43:44 - 43:50)
blue in 2001 since then I decided to (43:47 - 43:51)
catch up on the games in between (43:50 - 43:53)
I am currently playing through alpha (43:51 - 43:55)
sapphire which leads me to my question (43:53 - 43:58)
for the podcast it's been mentioned on (43:55 - 44:00)
the past few episodes that one sign that (43:58 - 44:03)
Sun and Moon may have also been built (44:00 - 44:05)
for switch is that there can be (44:03 - 44:08)
substantial slow down while playing even (44:05 - 44:11)
on the new Nintendo 3ds the thing is (44:08 - 44:13)
I've also noticed slowdown at times when (44:11 - 44:15)
playing alpha sapphire on the new (44:13 - 44:17)
Nintendo 3ds horde battles (44:15 - 44:20)
three-on-three or even when there is (44:17 - 44:22)
more than one pokemon on the screen that (44:20 - 44:27)
has a quote more active animation what (44:22 - 44:28)
are your thoughts on this (44:27 - 44:29)
since there are slowdowns in both games (44:28 - 44:31)
does this change your opinion of why (44:29 - 44:34)
their slowdown in Sun and Moon are we (44:31 - 44:36)
just under the same spell while we (44:34 - 44:40)
hanker for stars news Tom I think (44:36 - 44:42)
there's more than just that as the (44:40 - 44:44)
reason why an indicator of why it would (44:42 - 44:46)
be having a switch presence I'm not (44:44 - 44:48)
gonna say move to switch but having a (44:46 - 44:50)
switch version of the game because I (44:48 - 44:52)
think they also have (44:50 - 44:55)
taken the the graphics right the image (44:52 - 44:55)
files (44:55 - 44:58)
yeah little models and ported them and (44:55 - 45:01)
they poured out to 1080p quite easily (44:58 - 45:04)
and it's a nice experience (45:01 - 45:07)
yeah the slowdown is just one of many (45:04 - 45:10)
reasons why people including myself (45:07 - 45:14)
think that they built this for a more (45:10 - 45:17)
powerful system other than the 3ds aka (45:14 - 45:20)
the switch yeah well I think for me the (45:17 - 45:22)
biggest thing is how little actually (45:20 - 45:27)
uses how how unimportant the lower (45:22 - 45:30)
screen is in the game I mean the map is (45:27 - 45:32)
very it's cool that there's always a map (45:30 - 45:35)
there but it's not super important to me (45:32 - 45:37)
that's the biggest piece of evidence so (45:35 - 45:40)
yeah your point is good that like it's (45:37 - 45:43)
not new to have framerate drops in the (45:40 - 45:46)
game but but I think I agree with my (45:43 - 45:49)
co-host here that it's worth that alone (45:46 - 45:52)
you I think you would be unequivocally (45:49 - 45:55)
right that this doesn't really point (45:52 - 45:57)
anywhere but it's more of the fact of (45:55 - 46:00)
the other pieces of evidence with which (45:57 - 46:03)
it is packaged that make that make it as (46:00 - 46:04)
well seem like a piece of evidence (46:03 - 46:08)
towards that conclusion yeah I think (46:04 - 46:10)
those are three good points the bottom (46:08 - 46:13)
screen is useless the slowdown and the (46:10 - 46:15)
fact that people have ported them to (46:13 - 46:18)
1080p and those and don't we already (46:15 - 46:20)
know that Game Freak is working on (46:18 - 46:23)
something for the Nintendo switch yes (46:20 - 46:26)
which that's my that's my no it's not (46:23 - 46:28)
like that it's more like oh you're doing (46:26 - 46:30)
the like what is the sweater it's like (46:28 - 46:35)
the click yeah it's very difficult to do (46:30 - 46:38)
with one's mouth I hear ya ah nice the (46:35 - 46:41)
emails from Christina from Sunland (46:38 - 46:44)
California hey I was trying to send an (46:41 - 46:45)
email and I was having trouble figuring (46:44 - 46:47)
out how to do this so hopefully I did (46:45 - 46:49)
this right and wanted to share a story (46:47 - 46:52)
with you guys so I was so excited when (46:49 - 46:55)
Sun and Moon was released and I was sort (46:52 - 46:58)
of following along with you guys playing (46:55 - 47:01)
then near the end of the game around the (46:58 - 47:03)
sixth gym or so I was not feeling very (47:01 - 47:05)
well so I was not playing as much (47:03 - 47:08)
I would have wanted at one point I was (47:05 - 47:11)
playing and I felt sleepy as you do (47:08 - 47:13)
occasionally when you do not feel well (47:11 - 47:16)
when I set down my DS it slipped off the (47:13 - 47:18)
surface I was trying to place it on and (47:16 - 47:25)
slip into a bowl of dog water couldn't (47:18 - 47:27)
fix it and didn't have the money to (47:25 - 47:29)
replace my DS right away I'm assuming (47:27 - 47:31)
three DS by the way and I had to wait a (47:29 - 47:35)
quite a long time but I no longer really (47:31 - 47:37)
remember quite what I was doing in the (47:35 - 47:39)
middle of the time I stopped I was (47:37 - 47:42)
trying to build a living pokedex and I (47:39 - 47:44)
missed out on a few releases of rare (47:42 - 47:46)
Pokemon time limited limited time (47:44 - 47:49)
releases I've been debating restarting (47:46 - 47:51)
the game after transferring my current (47:49 - 47:54)
pokemon game into Pokemon Bank most (47:51 - 47:56)
likely but it doesn't have the same (47:54 - 47:58)
appeal as it did when I began so then I (47:56 - 48:00)
thought about your slack community but I (47:58 - 48:01)
don't know how to get there or anything (48:00 - 48:03)
about slack I know it's patreon (48:01 - 48:05)
exclusive but even though I don't have a (48:03 - 48:07)
lot of money I'd actually love to (48:05 - 48:09)
support you guys traditional stuff I (48:07 - 48:10)
don't have a favorite though (48:09 - 48:12)
but do you love to hear from Irene (48:10 - 48:14)
identify most with will I love hearing (48:12 - 48:16)
about competitive Pokemon from Travis (48:14 - 48:18)
even though I will probably never (48:16 - 48:20)
compete of course that all works if I (48:18 - 48:22)
haven't gotten anyone confused with (48:20 - 48:24)
anyone else I saw the video podcast I (48:22 - 48:27)
saw a video of the podcast once and I (48:24 - 48:29)
was really thrown for a loop because no (48:27 - 48:31)
one looked the way I imagined everyone (48:29 - 48:34)
did don't worry spj I love you too for (48:31 - 48:37)
everything you do thanks Christina (48:34 - 48:40)
it's a nice email I'm sorry your 3ds (48:37 - 48:43)
fell into dog water it sounds like the (48:40 - 48:45)
game was saved because they talked about (48:43 - 48:47)
transferring to Pokemon pink yeah (48:45 - 48:50)
are you disparaging dog water for some (48:47 - 48:51)
reason because there's nothing wrong (48:50 - 48:54)
with dog water I don't know but just the (48:51 - 48:55)
fact that you have to qualify that it's (48:54 - 48:58)
dog dog waters lying to slightly just no (48:55 - 49:01)
not if you change it every day and I (48:58 - 49:03)
think it's kind of to differentiate from (49:01 - 49:07)
the concept that she might have bowls of (49:03 - 49:11)
water just sitting at her house shall I (49:07 - 49:15)
yeah my LAN movie signs those are cups (49:11 - 49:18)
of water DUP bowls of water cups bowls (49:15 - 49:19)
it's all the same thing (49:18 - 49:22)
to your question about slack it's a it's (49:19 - 49:25)
a buck a month and then Steve will send (49:22 - 49:29)
you a link to join and then you can (49:25 - 49:32)
either download the slack app or use (49:29 - 49:35)
there's just a URL you can direct your (49:32 - 49:38)
browser to and talk in slack there (49:35 - 49:41)
everyone is really nice and fun and (49:38 - 49:45)
groovy and funny it's a fun crowd yeah (49:41 - 49:48)
like Travis said there's there's an app (49:45 - 49:50)
you can download you can download an app (49:48 - 49:54)
on your PC your Mac your iPhone your (49:50 - 49:56)
Android phone and I don't think anyone's (49:54 - 49:58)
using a Windows Phone anymore I think (49:56 - 50:01)
those are gone but also you could just (49:58 - 50:04)
go to a web browser like Internet (50:01 - 50:05)
Explorer Safari or Firefox or Google (50:04 - 50:09)
Chrome and just type in the the web link (50:05 - 50:10)
we give you and then log in so it is (50:09 - 50:12)
pretty easy but if you have more (50:10 - 50:13)
questions or if anyone has more (50:12 - 50:15)
questions about slack and patreon you (50:13 - 50:17)
can just shoot me an email and I'll be (50:15 - 50:20)
more than happy to answer your specific (50:17 - 50:22)
questions because what what we're giving (50:20 - 50:25)
is kind of general information here as (50:22 - 50:28)
for like restarting your game man that's (50:25 - 50:30)
that's tough like I totally know that (50:28 - 50:32)
feeling because I've had that feeling (50:30 - 50:36)
for Fallout 3 actually I got 30 or 40 (50:32 - 50:39)
hours into Fallout 3 and then my friend (50:36 - 50:42)
was playing technically my roommate at (50:39 - 50:44)
the time was also playing on my ps3 and (50:42 - 50:47)
they saved over my save with their save (50:44 - 50:50)
and it was like a fresh save so they (50:47 - 50:51)
were only like one or two hours in and (50:50 - 50:54)
that was like a gut-wrenching feeling of (50:51 - 50:56)
I don't want to start this over like (50:54 - 51:00)
there's a certain enjoyment at a point (50:56 - 51:02)
sometimes not all the time but sometimes (51:00 - 51:04)
like re going through what you've just (51:02 - 51:07)
lost is very hard for that to be (51:04 - 51:09)
enjoyable cuz you you wouldn't have done (51:07 - 51:11)
that like a lot of people restart games (51:09 - 51:14)
but to restart a game because you have (51:11 - 51:17)
to is like a totally different feeling (51:14 - 51:20)
this might be a this shouldn't be a (51:17 - 51:22)
controversial opinion I don't think but (51:20 - 51:26)
it might be given the nature of Pokemon (51:22 - 51:29)
fans if the prospect of playing Pokemon (51:26 - 51:32)
right now it doesn't seem fun don't do (51:29 - 51:33)
it (51:32 - 51:36)
Pokemon is a weird thing where like you (51:33 - 51:38)
know it it's not quite an animal (51:36 - 51:41)
crossing where you are actively punished (51:38 - 51:44)
for not playing every day but it is the (51:41 - 51:46)
type of game that has a certain momentum (51:44 - 51:49)
or inertia to it where if you haven't (51:46 - 51:52)
been playing for a while it's doesn't (51:49 - 51:53)
seem like it would be fun so unless you (51:52 - 51:54)
have like a specific thing motivating (51:53 - 51:57)
you to play like oh I really want to as (51:54 - 51:59)
you say like you feel really motivated (51:57 - 52:02)
to complete a living Dex or you want to (51:59 - 52:05)
breed a team to play competitively or on (52:02 - 52:06)
you've got a friend who you want to (52:05 - 52:08)
battle with a lot like unless you have (52:06 - 52:10)
what like an external motivator getting (52:08 - 52:11)
you back into it I don't necessarily (52:10 - 52:15)
think like forcing yourself to enjoy a (52:11 - 52:17)
thing you're not motivated to do is (52:15 - 52:19)
really gonna work like play another game (52:17 - 52:21)
and it'll probably be fun and then maybe (52:19 - 52:23)
something will come along and that'll be (52:21 - 52:26)
that all make you think oh I should play (52:23 - 52:29)
Pokemon again and actually wanting to (52:26 - 52:32)
play a video game is sort of in my as a (52:29 - 52:34)
prerequisite to having it be a fun (52:32 - 52:34)
experience (52:34 - 52:37)
ya know making sure that it's not work (52:34 - 52:40)
like yeah right I kind of like (52:37 - 52:42)
interspersed my pokemon playing with (52:40 - 52:45)
Monster Hunter playing or after I (52:42 - 52:48)
finished the game I'll play Pokemon when (52:45 - 52:50)
I want to build teams for various (52:48 - 52:52)
competitions and such and that's what (52:50 - 52:54)
keeps my interest but you know if you (52:52 - 52:55)
need to take a break for a little while (52:54 - 52:59)
just to let the story drain out and then (52:55 - 53:01)
you can get back into it again (52:59 - 53:03)
go for it I agree I think my biggest (53:01 - 53:06)
stop to playing Pokemon games is just (53:03 - 53:09)
the 3d s itself stop hitting the 3ds (53:06 - 53:12)
that's like I kind of want to go back (53:09 - 53:14)
and play red blue and yellow but then I (53:12 - 53:17)
think well then I gotta play on 3ds if (53:14 - 53:19)
it was on switch (53:17 - 53:21)
then we'd be talking the switch is (53:19 - 53:24)
really good it is really good it's (53:21 - 53:26)
everything I really want that's why that (53:24 - 53:27)
monster under announcement got me so (53:26 - 53:30)
excited because it's exactly what I want (53:27 - 53:33)
ah so excited okay so this is from Kevin (53:30 - 53:37)
from Atlanta Georgia messaged dear it's (53:33 - 53:40)
surely entertaining huh I happen to (53:37 - 53:41)
recall that in the anime there is a (53:40 - 53:44)
superhero who bases his entire prep (53:41 - 53:48)
presence slash persona on gligar if each (53:44 - 53:50)
of you suddenly became a superhero based (53:48 - 53:51)
on a Pokemon using their powers and (53:50 - 53:54)
abilities who would you pick and what (53:51 - 53:56)
would you call yourself and what would (53:54 - 53:58)
your collective adventures taint team (53:56 - 54:01)
name be sincerely frequent contributor (53:58 - 54:04)
Kevin aka Koopa Prez man I'm just not (54:01 - 54:07)
into superheroes at all this is really (54:04 - 54:09)
weird because this hasn't been announced (54:07 - 54:12)
anywhere but the episode comes out some (54:09 - 54:14)
well I guess probably the day you're (54:12 - 54:16)
listening to this if you're listening to (54:14 - 54:20)
it on Monday June 5th because which i (54:16 - 54:21)
think is when this comes out we're (54:20 - 54:23)
launching season 2 of very random (54:21 - 54:24)
encounters and we're playing the old (54:23 - 54:27)
Marvel Super Heroes uh role-playing game (54:24 - 54:29)
from the 80s so I'm really in a (54:27 - 54:33)
superhero mindset anyway so it's like I (54:29 - 54:35)
I just had to come up with a personality (54:33 - 54:37)
for a superhero that was randomly (54:35 - 54:39)
assigned to me and now I'm being asked (54:37 - 54:40)
to do it again and it's quite (54:39 - 54:42)
intimidating I'll make my own it's a (54:40 - 54:45)
tough one easy I would be hawlucha and (54:42 - 54:49)
have a wrestling persona and all of (54:45 - 54:51)
halogen boobs are wrestling based so (54:49 - 54:54)
it's really boring but that's what (54:51 - 54:58)
you're getting oh I am I answer (54:54 - 55:01)
I think I would do I think I would do (54:58 - 55:05)
like slack off and it would I would like (55:01 - 55:07)
it would look like I was just like a (55:05 - 55:10)
sleep resting somewhere but then all of (55:07 - 55:12)
a sudden I would just like summon all of (55:10 - 55:14)
my it because I had been like the (55:12 - 55:16)
superpower would be like the more I rest (55:14 - 55:19)
the more energy I like consolidate and (55:16 - 55:21)
then could spring upon you and just (55:19 - 55:24)
wreck you in one quick movement and then (55:21 - 55:25)
go right back to sleep (55:24 - 55:28)
that'd be a fun power so I would be high (55:25 - 55:31)
dreamin and I would have high drag on (55:28 - 55:33)
stuff like me and my high dragon would (55:31 - 55:37)
go and wreck stuff and I guess the name (55:33 - 55:39)
would be the human sloth is what I would (55:37 - 55:43)
be yeah and then what's our what's our (55:39 - 55:46)
team name so we have a weird sloth we (55:43 - 55:50)
have a three-headed dragon beast and (55:46 - 55:55)
then a wrestler the Polk Avengers that's (55:50 - 56:01)
so bad I aim at something now the (55:55 - 56:03)
Justice League of Kanto (56:01 - 56:05)
what about assists like the Pokemon move (56:03 - 56:08)
but it's also we assist the people of (56:05 - 56:12)
pokey world but that's better I like I (56:08 - 56:14)
like the concept of it being based off (56:12 - 56:17)
like a move like we could be the seismic (56:14 - 56:19)
toss there's wait (56:17 - 56:26)
screw what we're moving on in gars from (56:19 - 56:31)
Latvia Wrightson bin guard sorry I'm (56:26 - 56:34)
butchering your name I apologize rights (56:31 - 56:35)
and hey I recently started a new job (56:34 - 56:37)
which requires little attention to be (56:35 - 56:40)
put in that's my kinda job and I thought (56:37 - 56:42)
of listening to some podcasts to pass (56:40 - 56:44)
the time so I checked the Play Store for (56:42 - 56:46)
some podcast app downloaded one and (56:44 - 56:48)
reopened it but then I kind of got (56:46 - 56:50)
confused because I did not think of any (56:48 - 56:52)
topics I would actually like to listen (56:50 - 56:53)
about and the first thing that crossed (56:52 - 56:56)
my mind was Pokemon and I found you guys (56:53 - 56:58)
I have listened to your most recent (56:56 - 57:00)
episode and realized that it's really (56:58 - 57:03)
wonderful and I decided to go back to (57:00 - 57:05)
all your episodes from the beginning (57:03 - 57:06)
it's the earliest I found on the podcast (57:05 - 57:10)
app was episode 49 so I started there (57:06 - 57:11)
and I've been listening at (57:10 - 57:14)
work each day for about two to three (57:11 - 57:17)
weeks now I am currently on episode 76 (57:14 - 57:19)
the podcast is getting more and more (57:17 - 57:22)
awesome you have made me fully indulged (57:19 - 57:24)
into Pokemon and I've decided that I (57:22 - 57:27)
want to finish all the main games start (57:24 - 57:28)
with Pokemon go and I'm currently out (57:27 - 57:31)
the last gym battle what I kind of like (57:28 - 57:33)
in listening to your podcast episodes is (57:31 - 57:34)
the feeling that I'm making a journey (57:33 - 57:37)
together with a super effective team (57:34 - 57:39)
currently Sun and Moon has already been (57:37 - 57:41)
out for some while but in my journey (57:39 - 57:43)
with you guys black and white 2 was only (57:41 - 57:45)
about to come out the fields are simply (57:43 - 57:47)
amazing I realized I really like Pokemon (57:45 - 57:50)
the anime is ok but the games are just (57:47 - 57:53)
otherworldly and to be able to (57:50 - 57:56)
experience how it all processed and grew (57:53 - 57:58)
together with your experiences is just (57:56 - 58:00)
amazing well that's all I just wanted (57:58 - 58:02)
message and show some some support and I (58:00 - 58:04)
hope the show will still be running when (58:02 - 58:05)
I'm through the rest of the episodes (58:04 - 58:07)
thank you for that email there's no (58:05 - 58:10)
question them but I will say the reason (58:07 - 58:12)
you only found episode 49 is because (58:10 - 58:16)
most podcast apps including I would (58:12 - 58:18)
probably say the two popular ones Google (58:16 - 58:21)
Play Music and iTunes they can only (58:18 - 58:27)
store 250 RSS feed episodes so since (58:21 - 58:31)
we're well over Episode two fit to fifty (58:27 - 58:33)
and there was many episodes in between (58:31 - 58:36)
like the Sun and Moon series and the X&Y (58:33 - 58:38)
series that's why you don't see episode (58:36 - 58:40)
1 anymore because we're just so far past (58:38 - 58:42)
that but that doesn't mean that they (58:40 - 58:45)
don't exist if you go to the soundcloud (58:42 - 58:48)
page or you just manually enter the (58:45 - 58:51)
direct RSS feed in your podcast app it (58:48 - 58:53)
will show all of them it's just like (58:51 - 58:56)
iTunes store only shows 250 episodes at (58:53 - 58:59)
a time I mean I joke about how like on I (58:56 - 59:04)
joke about how much I how terrified it (58:59 - 59:05)
makes me that people listen to old (59:04 - 59:07)
episodes with me when I was a little (59:05 - 59:09)
height a literal high school student (59:07 - 59:11)
that weirds me out a lot I mean I I bet (59:09 - 59:14)
if you're a listener you can imagine how (59:11 - 59:16)
strange that would be if you are in my (59:14 - 59:20)
place mainly it's just like it's I don't (59:16 - 59:23)
remember what happens on those episodes (59:20 - 59:25)
and it's still really weird feeling to (59:23 - 59:25)
think that (59:25 - 59:28)
people today are listening to me say (59:25 - 59:31)
things that I don't remember saying from (59:28 - 59:35)

been visited yet and instead of being (63:23 - 63:28)

if we're talking that's supposed to be (64:19 - 64:23)
like a team I guess I would evolve it (64:21 - 64:27)
even Italy underrated Persians cool and (64:23 - 64:29)
then from gen 2 I would do piloswine I (64:27 - 64:31)

season of mythical is from sin I'll do a (66:05 - 66:09)
couple more here I was trying to get (66:06 - 66:10)
through older emails there's all these (66:09 - 66:11)
new email questions (66:10 - 66:14)
Devon writes in hello I have a question (66:11 - 66:17)
regards to Pokemon go has the game (66:14 - 66:19)
changed your opinion about any specific (66:17 - 66:22)
Pokemon I used to overlook Bulava but (66:19 - 66:23)
now I think it's one of the cutest (66:22 - 66:24)
pokemons (66:23 - 66:26)
especially the Polka sorry he said they (66:24 - 66:28)
said Pokemon I added the s that was my (66:26 - 66:31)
fault especially like it's animations (66:28 - 66:34)
furet is also super cute it runs up to (66:31 - 66:36)
the animated app to the screen and (66:34 - 66:38)
scratches with regards to recent events (66:36 - 66:41)
I think the success is really based on (66:38 - 66:45)
the biome you live in I have I live in a (66:41 - 66:48)
desert / Mountain biome so water and (66:45 - 66:50)
grass pokemon water and grass events (66:48 - 66:52)
were pretty awesome the water event (66:50 - 66:54)
really filled up my pokedex and during (66:52 - 66:55)
the grass event we had tons of spawns (66:54 - 66:57)
that we don't ever see (66:55 - 66:59)
however the rock event was a dud it only (66:57 - 67:01)
increased spawns the only increased (66:59 - 67:03)
bombs of Slugma it was quite (67:01 - 67:05)
disappointing I don't think the event (67:03 - 67:07)
success should be based on which Pokemon (67:05 - 67:09)
are spawning go offer such a different (67:07 - 67:11)
experience based on your location it's (67:09 - 67:12)
really hard to judge the success or (67:11 - 67:14)
failure of the event thanks for your (67:12 - 67:17)
awesome podcast signing off lime Rickey (67:14 - 67:19)
no I would say the grass event was a dud (67:17 - 67:21)
because it was only three days compared (67:19 - 67:24)
to the adventure week which was like (67:21 - 67:26)
eight or nine days maybe a week maybe (67:24 - 67:29)
I'm either way the adventure week was (67:26 - 67:31)
twice as long if not longer than the (67:29 - 67:35)
grass week I didn't get grass pokemon I (67:31 - 67:37)
got like right at as and hoot hoots and (67:35 - 67:39)
not twos I got the same exact things I (67:37 - 67:41)
was always getting at my house (67:39 - 67:44)
or my work so that's why I would say (67:41 - 67:46)
that it was a dud adventure adventure (67:44 - 67:48)
week though was very noticeable in (67:46 - 67:51)
spawns we don't get a lot of rock type (67:48 - 67:54)
Pokemon in the Midwest yeah I'm just (67:51 - 67:56)
saying I'm not saying I'm not I wasn't (67:54 - 67:58)
seeing any grass pokemon i've Caterpie (67:56 - 68:02)
we Dalls piggies riot as not to code (67:58 - 68:04)
hoots like none of those regress and I (68:02 - 68:06)
like yeah I still saw those for (68:04 - 68:08)
adventure week but not nearly as often (68:06 - 68:11)
as I saw a slugma or a Geodude (68:08 - 68:15)
I think if I were gonna pick a (68:11 - 68:15)
c'mon that I like more because of (68:15 - 68:20)
Pokemon go I mean I have already always (68:17 - 68:23)
kind of liked ditto but I like how did (68:20 - 68:26)
out functions in Pokemon go that you (68:23 - 68:27)
don't know you're gonna catch it until (68:26 - 68:29)
you do I think that's really cool I (68:27 - 68:32)
agree I kind of do the other night and (68:29 - 68:34)
it was it was a very exciting moment (68:32 - 68:36)
even though I've had I have had dittos (68:34 - 68:39)
and Pokemon go in the past it was a (68:36 - 68:41)
Ratatat that turned into a ditto and it (68:39 - 68:45)
was oh oh yeah this is the thing oh cool (68:41 - 68:49)
yeah ditto ah yeah yeah yeah I just (68:45 - 68:50)
don't think people should be going out (68:49 - 68:52)
in the middle of the night and riding (68:50 - 68:54)
bikes on city streets yeah catching (68:52 - 68:56)
pokemons let me tell you hey here's the (68:54 - 68:59)
thing this is this is like kind of (68:56 - 69:04)
Pokemon go related in the city I'm (68:59 - 69:06)
living in I always say I live near Grand (69:04 - 69:09)
Rapids which is no longer really even (69:06 - 69:13)
true I am in a another town kind of in (69:09 - 69:15)
the area of Grand Rapids Michigan but (69:13 - 69:19)
they had a there's the thing last night (69:15 - 69:21)
or like all day yesterday that was like (69:19 - 69:23)
a pub crawl but you were encouraged to (69:21 - 69:27)
go on a bike from place with alcohol to (69:23 - 69:30)
place with alcohol so imagine all these (69:27 - 69:31)
people who have ingested like a lot of (69:30 - 69:33)
adult beverages that'll Tavor because (69:31 - 69:35)
it's in the sump at right and because (69:33 - 69:38)
it's in the summer they're also playing (69:35 - 69:40)
pokemon go so people on their phones (69:38 - 69:44)
playing pokemon go after imbibing a lot (69:40 - 69:50)
of um of not e-liquid like that's a (69:44 - 69:52)
recipe for disaster and the place i work (69:50 - 69:55)
happens to have like the whole front (69:52 - 69:58)
wall is just like glass windows so there (69:55 - 69:59)
were a ton of people that I saw with (69:58 - 70:01)
like phones in their hands playing (69:59 - 70:03)
Pokemon go that like almost or just did (70:01 - 70:06)
fall on their faces so don't do that (70:03 - 70:09)
I it's (70:06 - 70:12)
very difficult to (70:09 - 70:14)
operate a bike and a phone at the same (70:12 - 70:19)
time yep I've been ever since adventure (70:14 - 70:22)
week I've been very and I talked about (70:19 - 70:24)
this last week I said I was more (70:22 - 70:27)
compelled to finish my pokedex in (70:24 - 70:30)
Pokemon go than I have ever been in the (70:27 - 70:32)
main series games and I don't and I (70:30 - 70:36)
didn't know how to explain why I felt (70:32 - 70:38)
the way it did because that and in (70:36 - 70:41)
spoiler I still don't know why that is (70:38 - 70:44)
but to continue off my adventure week (70:41 - 70:48)
and to continue filling my Pokemon go (70:44 - 70:50)
pokin (70:48 - 70:54)
called up Micah I think this is (70:50 - 70:56)
knowledge but Mike and I live in the (70:54 - 70:58)
same city (70:56 - 70:59)
so I called up Micah and I said hey (70:58 - 71:02)
let's go to the lake park tonight I (70:59 - 71:04)
haven't been there since I haven't been (71:02 - 71:06)
there when it's the stops have been open (71:04 - 71:08)
and I want to catch Pokemon and I want (71:06 - 71:10)
to see how many stops actually got (71:08 - 71:12)
removed I want to know more details (71:10 - 71:15)
because I was at Lake Park for my (71:12 - 71:17)
interview with CBS when they interviewed (71:15 - 71:19)
me about Pokemon go but I didn't have (71:17 - 71:21)
time to like actually besides like the (71:19 - 71:23)
first area of the parking lot didn't (71:21 - 71:25)
have time to walk through the park and (71:23 - 71:27)
see what is there and what's not there I (71:25 - 71:30)
pick them up we head over to Lake Park (71:27 - 71:33)
we get at like park at 904 p.m. the (71:30 - 71:36)
stops are closed confirmation that these (71:33 - 71:37)
stops closed definitely at 9:00 I (71:36 - 71:39)
thought it was ten but it's it's at nine (71:37 - 71:42)
so stops are closed I said hey let's (71:39 - 71:44)
just walk through Lake Park I just want (71:42 - 71:46)
I want to count stops I want to see (71:44 - 71:49)
what's gone and what's not (71:46 - 71:50)
so first pokemon i see when we get to (71:49 - 71:53)
Lake Park is Totodile already excited (71:50 - 71:55)
I'm already extremely satisfied with (71:53 - 71:56)
this trip because I don't have a (71:55 - 71:59)
totodile to catch the Totodile I see (71:56 - 72:01)
that there's also a Grimer at Lake Park (71:59 - 72:03)
I don't have a Grimer I'm looking for (72:01 - 72:04)
the Grimer so we're walking through (72:03 - 72:09)
anyways we count that Lake Park had (72:04 - 72:13)
about seven to eight stops removed out (72:09 - 72:15)
of the entire park and it's not that big (72:13 - 72:17)
of a park there are still stops there it (72:15 - 72:19)
would still be a place that I would (72:17 - 72:22)
would it mind going in the future and (72:19 - 72:25)
then like two miles away I wasn't me (72:22 - 72:27)
maybe a mile away (72:25 - 72:29)
Snorlax appeared (72:27 - 72:31)
and I'd never Snorlax so I hooked it (72:29 - 72:34)
caught that Snorlax extremely satisfied (72:31 - 72:37)
again with the night I also got a cynic (72:34 - 72:38)
will that night too (72:37 - 72:42)
so mica says hey let's go over to (72:38 - 72:43)
Discovery World in the Milwaukee Art (72:42 - 72:45)
Museum let's there's a bunch of stops (72:43 - 72:48)
there let's just go over there so we (72:45 - 72:50)
were probably walking for about an hour (72:48 - 72:52)
an hour hour and a half around lake park (72:50 - 72:55)
so we go over there my concern was all (72:52 - 72:56)
the stops were gonna be closed because (72:55 - 73:00)
on both sides of the our museum and (72:56 - 73:02)
discover your world there are two parks (73:00 - 73:05)
and then Summerfest is over there as (73:02 - 73:08)
well and they weren't closed so we (73:05 - 73:10)
caught some Pokemon and then we saw a (73:08 - 73:13)
bunch of people leave discovery world on (73:10 - 73:15)
bikes I was like oh that's that's weird (73:13 - 73:19)
it's it's like 11 o'clock at night these (73:15 - 73:22)
where these bikers come from so in front (73:19 - 73:23)
of Discovery World there's what's called (73:22 - 73:26)
a bubbler they're one of those rent I (73:23 - 73:29)
don't know Travis or wheel if if you (73:26 - 73:30)
have these in your town but they're just (73:29 - 73:33)
bike rental places where you just pay (73:30 - 73:36)
for the hour yep yeah it's called DC (73:33 - 73:40)
bike share okay so I forget what the one (73:36 - 73:42)
is that's in Grand Rapids but yeah most (73:40 - 73:44)
of them are owned by a company called B (73:42 - 73:47)
cycle be cycle owns bubbler but they (73:44 - 73:49)
also own Madison bikes which is the same (73:47 - 73:51)
thing in Madison so it works universally (73:49 - 73:53)
there's also one stop they also own some (73:51 - 73:56)
in Indiana so I am now a bike member (73:53 - 73:58)
because of this but you can rent bikes (73:56 - 74:01)
in Indiana for example so we walk over (73:58 - 74:04)
and I go hey we should get a bike and (74:01 - 74:06)
Mike is like okay let's do it and I was (74:04 - 74:08)
like I was I wasn't being serious but (74:06 - 74:10)
now I'm curious how much it costs to (74:08 - 74:13)
rent a bike so I went up to the Machine (74:10 - 74:16)
and it's $3 for every half hour or you (74:13 - 74:18)
get unlimited rides for a month for $15 (74:16 - 74:20)
a month but I know that at the time so (74:18 - 74:23)
we rented a bike and I haven't ridden a (74:20 - 74:28)
bike since I was maybe 19 maybe 18 bikes (74:23 - 74:29)
are good and fun (74:28 - 74:33)
I instant like zero struggle I'm getting (74:29 - 74:35)
I know the old saying is like you never (74:33 - 74:37)
forget how to ride a bike but it (74:35 - 74:40)
couldn't be more true I got on that bike (74:37 - 74:43)
I knew how to ride that bike I had a (74:40 - 74:46)
great great time on that bike I biked (74:43 - 74:48)
like three miles that night and that's (74:46 - 74:50)
not I'm not saying that's a lot I'm just (74:48 - 74:54)
saying by 3 miles and we went from (74:50 - 74:57)
discovery world to the Art Museum to the (74:54 - 75:01)
Third Ward of Milwaukee which has just I (74:57 - 75:03)
don't know why people are so upset about (75:01 - 75:06)
Lake Park there is a three block stretch (75:03 - 75:08)
three city blocks so not that big and (75:06 - 75:13)
each there's 12 stops for 812 poor stops (75:08 - 75:16)
per block you can hit that you can walk (75:13 - 75:18)
that whole thing in five six minutes and (75:16 - 75:21)
then turn around and go back up it that (75:18 - 75:25)
what who cares about Lake Park guys I am (75:21 - 75:27)
mad about Lake Park because I don't want (75:25 - 75:30)
the man telling me what I can and can't (75:27 - 75:32)
do and when I can and can't do it so (75:30 - 75:35)
that's true the man can go take his laws (75:32 - 75:36)
and put them where they belong (75:35 - 75:38)
which is not on my body thank you that's (75:36 - 75:41)
true I agree with that but even if Lake (75:38 - 75:44)
Park was still as active and had seven (75:41 - 75:46)
more stops I feel like the Third Ward is (75:44 - 75:48)
really the place to go (75:46 - 75:51)
I love the biking so much because also (75:48 - 75:53)
biking counts for hatching your eggs (75:51 - 75:56)
because you're not going terribly fast (75:53 - 75:59)
well plus you can hatch eggs on a bike (75:56 - 76:00)
in the game so it would be arable if you (75:59 - 76:02)
couldn't yeah you're right (76:00 - 76:04)
well the story bikes are good and fun (76:02 - 76:06)
yeah I like them all I went back the (76:04 - 76:08)
second night and did it again and did (76:06 - 76:10)
six miles on the bike and my legs felt (76:08 - 76:13)
like noodles and all I want to do now is (76:10 - 76:15)
go back at night and bike and play (76:13 - 76:18)
pokemon go it's a real great feeling (76:15 - 76:20)
unfortunately I can't do that cuz I (76:18 - 76:22)
don't have the Apple watch but yeah (76:20 - 76:26)
Pokemon go plus then you would need the (76:22 - 76:29)
app just open in your basket as I (76:26 - 76:31)
mentioned before I do not approve of (76:29 - 76:38)
operating both a smart device and a bye (76:31 - 76:40)
at the same time you don't have to (76:38 - 76:41)
operate it though you just have to have (76:40 - 76:43)
the app open and then put it in your (76:41 - 76:45)
bike best I got you're just you're just (76:43 - 76:47)
talking about to hatch yes yes yeah (76:45 - 76:49)
well also there's a big difference when (76:47 - 76:51)
you're you know riding a bike around (76:49 - 76:54)
downtown Grand Rapids at one o'clock in (76:51 - 76:57)
the morning versus you know evening when (76:54 - 76:59)
people are in cars that's true around (76:57 - 77:02)
inside yeah one of the benefits at 10:01 (76:59 - 77:04)
was in Grand Rapids what one of the (77:02 - 77:05)
reasons why I like the night riding is (77:04 - 77:09)
because there's not that many cars are (77:05 - 77:11)
you a night writer you better believe it (77:09 - 77:14)
and there it's also way cooler new (77:11 - 77:17)
co-hosts I'm super effective kid the (77:14 - 77:20)
sun's not out it's not beating down on (77:17 - 77:22)
your neck well and also you're a vampire (77:20 - 77:24)
yeah that mean though that that's all (77:22 - 77:26)
true (77:24 - 77:27)
ah let's do one more email and then (77:26 - 77:30)
we'll jump over to Pokemon the week hear (77:27 - 77:33)
this message from luke from memphis (77:30 - 77:34)
tennessee (77:33 - 77:36)
deer spj and friends i love the latest (77:34 - 77:39)
episode where you just where you and (77:36 - 77:40)
your discussion about the latest amazing (77:39 - 77:43)
game Magikarp jump when I first started (77:40 - 77:46)
I saved up 600 gems to get Charizard he (77:43 - 77:48)
is amazing but then I listened to the (77:46 - 77:49)
episode to find out what things to buy I (77:48 - 77:51)
am now on my way to getting the (77:49 - 77:54)
whimsicott cushion I love the encounters (77:51 - 77:56)
you get in the game and I always scold (77:54 - 77:58)
Magikarp because you can regain all (77:56 - 78:00)
three training points I agree that's the (77:58 - 78:03)
that's the right thing to do I love it (78:00 - 78:05)
when you see a pokeball and you snag it (78:03 - 78:09)
and it says carp DM throw caution to the (78:05 - 78:10)
wind or something like that it's pretty (78:09 - 78:13)
hilarious and it refuses to jump for the (78:10 - 78:16)
berry it says better safe than sushi I (78:13 - 78:19)
really love this jump there's some good (78:16 - 78:22)
puns i still play pokemon go i have a (78:19 - 78:24)
few questions if you could lead an army (78:22 - 78:26)
of pokemon not Legendary's what would it (78:24 - 78:29)
be i would lead a bunch of toka kiss (78:26 - 78:30)
because Togekiss is my favorite pokemon (78:29 - 78:33)
what pokemon would you choose to be your (78:30 - 78:35)
guardian to protect you from all harm (78:33 - 78:36)
I would choose aegislash keep up the (78:35 - 78:40)
amazing work sincerely Luke can I would (78:36 - 78:43)
have an army of durant because they work (78:40 - 78:46)
well together in big things for me good (78:43 - 78:48)
answer yes that's a really thoughtful (78:46 - 78:51)
answer uh-oh (78:48 - 78:55)
Combee alright alright I'm just I'm just (78:51 - 78:57)
stealing wills answer basically like (78:55 - 78:58)
that I'll do something I'll say like (78:57 - 79:00)
good cuz they already see their D seem (78:58 - 79:02)
like they're soldiers so it's like (79:00 - 79:03)
they're already trained for it (79:02 - 79:06)
hmm I see what you say I'll have to come (79:03 - 79:09)
back on that one ah guardian pokemon to (79:06 - 79:13)
protect you oh I would do like I feel (79:09 - 79:14)
like I should do one where I could like (79:13 - 79:17)
go I could like trying to think if (79:14 - 79:20)
there's a pokemon that has like an orb (79:17 - 79:22)
in its body I can just go in so I'm like (79:20 - 79:25)
completely protected reunify thanks yeah (79:22 - 79:27)
I should just I should just happen to (79:25 - 79:30)
one of the little reunit list jellies (79:27 - 79:32)
and then I'm completely safe and I can (79:30 - 79:35)
bounce around and have a good time (79:32 - 79:37)
but you can't breathe in there I would (79:35 - 79:42)
say no I would say medicham that's a (79:37 - 79:44)
good interested what's your reasoning (79:42 - 79:47)
there they could put up barrier protect (79:44 - 79:50)
light screen it's true well if you want (79:47 - 79:52)
that then I'm picking Wobbuffet (79:50 - 79:55)
Wobbuffet just an expert in all that (79:52 - 79:58)
stuff it doesn't have the screens does (79:55 - 80:00)
it no I mean but it absorbs the damage (79:58 - 80:03)
and then that the air it deals yeah hard (80:00 - 80:05)
it so if I'm doing dual screens I got it (80:03 - 80:06)
you then you got to do something like (80:05 - 80:08)
klefki because it's got prankster and (80:06 - 80:08)
that's better (80:08 - 80:11)
klefki would be the less space in your (80:08 - 80:12)
house (80:11 - 80:14)
I feel like Wobbuffet would give it it's (80:12 - 80:17)
really cute yeah (80:14 - 80:19)
I want to talk about Magikarp splash (80:17 - 80:21)
just or Matt sorry magic carpet jump (80:19 - 80:23)
just a little bit (80:21 - 80:26)
Travis yours you're still playing are (80:23 - 80:28)
you gonna continue playing much to my (80:26 - 80:31)
own chagrin I will continue playing like (80:28 - 80:33)
there's no burnout for you there is I (80:31 - 80:35)
hate it I hate that I'm playing it right (80:33 - 80:36)
now as we speak (80:35 - 80:39)
I just I'm just the type of person where (80:36 - 80:40)
if there's a button to be pressed that (80:39 - 80:43)
gives me a thing it pains me if I'm not (80:40 - 80:45)
actively pressing it it's a terrible (80:43 - 80:48)
thing with how my brain works and I (80:45 - 80:51)
can't stop it and it won't stop until (80:48 - 80:54)
somehow I forget that it exists I mean (80:51 - 80:55)
it gives your finger something to do (80:54 - 80:58)
right I mean there are other mobile (80:55 - 81:00)
games that do that though yeah but not (80:58 - 81:03)
ones that have likes Pokemon yeah and (81:00 - 81:06)
you're not playing Pokemon go I'm (81:03 - 81:08)
playing a tiny bit of Pokemon okay cuz I (81:06 - 81:09)
mean you instead of opening magic carpet (81:08 - 81:11)
jump and I'm not saying you should or (81:09 - 81:13)
not I'm just giving a hypothetical you (81:11 - 81:15)
could open Pokemon go catch one or two (81:13 - 81:18)
Pokemon and then close it that's true (81:15 - 81:22)
I'm still playing Magikarp jump I'm (81:18 - 81:25)
still liking it I have felt a little bit (81:22 - 81:26)
of burnout so taking like two days off (81:25 - 81:28)
or like a day and a half I don't (81:26 - 81:31)
remember exactly was it was nice (81:28 - 81:34)
I would say most the burnout isn't from (81:31 - 81:37)
the game itself it's from these training (81:34 - 81:40)
/ gym cutscenes (81:37 - 81:42)
yeah I have never been more frustrated (81:40 - 81:45)
to get though words of wisdom cut screen (81:42 - 81:48)
cuts the cutscene yeah that does nothing (81:45 - 81:52)
for you it does nothing and I looked it (81:48 - 81:54)
up it's a funny joke the first time it (81:52 - 81:56)
happens it's really funny the first time (81:54 - 82:00)
and now it's it's it's it's wasting my (81:56 - 82:00)
time (82:00 - 82:04)
yeah it is nothing but wasting six (82:00 - 82:07)
seconds of my life and it's mr. Resetti (82:04 - 82:09)
but you didn't do anything wrong (82:07 - 82:11)
but mr. Resetti is punishing you for (82:09 - 82:13)
turning off your game Zack that's (82:11 - 82:15)
exactly what I'm saying it's mr. Resetti (82:13 - 82:17)
if you didn't have to do anything wrong (82:15 - 82:19)
to make mr. Resetti show oh yeah yeah (82:17 - 82:22)
like why is that not a one-time joke why (82:19 - 82:25)
continue to tell me that nothing is (82:22 - 82:29)
happening it's so frustrating the other (82:25 - 82:32)
not this isn't frustrating but you know (82:29 - 82:34)
the one where you see the fruit in the (82:32 - 82:37)
water mm-hmm I think it's called the the (82:34 - 82:40)
old rod or the good rod yeah it's called (82:37 - 82:42)
old rod I think there's no bad (82:40 - 82:46)
punishment for that you can lose JP but (82:42 - 82:47)
you don't lose your magic yeah you don't (82:46 - 82:50)
die yeah which was the big worry there I (82:47 - 82:56)
still continue I cannot not open Voltorb (82:50 - 82:58)
I won't do that one if I've got a (82:56 - 83:00)
Pokemon earth a Pokemon if I've got a (82:58 - 83:04)
magic harp of a color where I still have (83:00 - 83:07)
patterns that I need like if I've got a (83:04 - 83:09)
magic harp that's small so it hasn't yet (83:07 - 83:11)
gotten big enough to where I see the (83:09 - 83:14)
full detail of its patterns and it's of (83:11 - 83:16)
a color for which I do not have all of (83:14 - 83:20)
the patterns I won't take it (83:16 - 83:22)
otherwise I will we talked last week (83:20 - 83:25)
about how I hadn't like ever seen it go (83:22 - 83:27)
well for me all of my bad luck must have (83:25 - 83:29)
been front-loaded because I've hardly (83:27 - 83:31)
ever had it explode on me since and the (83:29 - 83:34)
same thing with the pidgeotto one it's (83:31 - 83:36)
so it's been I've had a lot better luck (83:34 - 83:38)
with it lately and since we talked I had (83:36 - 83:40)
really good luck with the Voltorb and (83:38 - 83:44)
then I got I got five to six explosions (83:40 - 83:46)
in a row (83:44 - 83:48)
and then I'm back to the back to the (83:46 - 83:50)
good one did you get to the spoiler (83:48 - 83:52)
there's like a gray Magikarp are you (83:50 - 83:55)
there yet yep okay cuz I'm not that's (83:52 - 83:57)
cuz when you said like you won't take it (83:55 - 83:58)
when you have a pattern you don't (83:57 - 84:01)
already have I have all the current (83:58 - 84:04)
patterns correct right but I know when (84:01 - 84:07)
you beat a certain league at unlocks to (84:04 - 84:09)
new pattern or to new base patterns (84:07 - 84:12)
yeah to new colors yeah each of which (84:09 - 84:15)
has three I think yes patterns within it (84:12 - 84:19)
yes we got some corrections on this but (84:15 - 84:22)
because we said I said I said we didn't (84:19 - 84:24)
look up anything clique last week I (84:22 - 84:26)
think we both didn't know what Charizard (84:24 - 84:29)
it'd do you click on the get button it (84:26 - 84:31)
does tell you yeah it doesn't think that (84:29 - 84:32)
clear though so the reason I didn't (84:31 - 84:35)
click on it is because I had I know how (84:32 - 84:38)
much is popular I think 500 yeah so I (84:35 - 84:42)
had like 300 and some gems so I didn't (84:38 - 84:43)
want to click on slowpoke because I (84:42 - 84:45)
didn't want to accidentally by slowpoke (84:43 - 84:48)
so that's why I didn't know what's and (84:45 - 84:49)
it's also weird because that's not how (84:48 - 84:52)
the other shops and the game work like (84:49 - 84:55)
if you're buying a decoration it has a (84:52 - 84:57)
description with the lower Asian dunce (84:55 - 84:59)
under it yeah but that's not the case (84:57 - 85:01)
for the support Pokemon which is very a (84:59 - 85:04)
very strange choice yeah it's very odd (85:01 - 85:07)
papa leo (85:04 - 85:08)
he's in the water with you that's still (85:07 - 85:10)
frustrating for me like popular was real (85:08 - 85:11)
cute he's my boy (85:10 - 85:15)
I want him out of my way he's every 7 (85:11 - 85:17)
hours though not that big of a deal I (85:15 - 85:19)
think that's really able to say unless (85:17 - 85:21)
you have anything else I made it to (85:19 - 85:23)
level my life while we were recording (85:21 - 85:24)
congratulations (85:23 - 85:28)
why thank you on that slow road to level (85:24 - 85:31)
46 like you guys yeah 50 once you know (85:28 - 85:34)
it's all about perseverance character (85:31 - 85:36)
and integrity I wish there was a way to (85:34 - 85:38)
auto battle like just take me through (85:36 - 85:41)
the league I get it especially where I (85:38 - 85:43)
am cuz I guess do you mind if I spoil (85:41 - 85:46)
what happens after the luxury league you (85:43 - 85:47)
go through a new league that just you (85:46 - 85:50)
can repeat over and over right right so (85:47 - 85:52)
it's like I'm just seeing the same (85:50 - 85:54)
things over it's not even like I mean (85:52 - 85:55)
not that I wasn't seeing the same things (85:54 - 85:57)
over and over again before but now I (85:55 - 86:00)
really am and I still have to watch it (85:57 - 86:03)
so it's boring to watch the leagues I (86:00 - 86:05)
mean I still like it don't get me wrong (86:03 - 86:08)
I just I feel like we said everything (86:05 - 86:10)
that's good about it and now all that's (86:08 - 86:13)
left is the slowness that exists in the (86:10 - 86:15)
game which I can't help thinking about (86:13 - 86:18)
because the that the slowness of how (86:15 - 86:20)
everything moves whether that's battles (86:18 - 86:24)
or the wasting your time with the words (86:20 - 86:27)
of wisdom like those take up so much (86:24 - 86:30)
more time than the actual fun part of (86:27 - 86:32)
the game that I can't yet hope but just (86:30 - 86:34)
consistently think about it (86:32 - 86:36)
there's like a times girl moles (86:34 - 86:38)
heartedly if the game was like hey we'll (86:36 - 86:42)
speed up everything 50% if you pay $10 I (86:38 - 86:44)
would throw so much money you had it (86:42 - 86:46)
because I just don't don't say that now (86:44 - 86:49)
they are gonna know if they were working (86:46 - 86:50)
on some sort of fast-forward now they (86:49 - 86:52)
are going to charge us for it (86:50 - 86:53)
well like even I thought about like (86:52 - 86:55)
giving more money in cuz right when you (86:53 - 86:57)
when you pay it accelerates the game (86:55 - 87:00)
right but yours (86:57 - 87:02)
but it doesn't accelerate the part of (87:00 - 87:06)
the game that is bad huh like I don't (87:02 - 87:09)
mind eating I don't mind spending my (87:06 - 87:11)
coins I don't mind the training sessions (87:09 - 87:14)
it's just yeah it's just beating a dead (87:11 - 87:18)
horse at this point that poor horse (87:14 - 87:22)
Magikarp jump then stores now digital (87:18 - 87:26)
stores Travis hmm give me give me the (87:22 - 87:31)
Pokemon of the week the Pokemon of the (87:26 - 87:33)
week for this week is a Pokemon that I (87:31 - 87:35)
really like but often forget about but (87:33 - 87:37)
when I'm reminded of it I remember that (87:35 - 87:39)
I liked it and that it is cool that is (87:37 - 87:43)
the Pokemon heliolisk has an interesting (87:39 - 87:48)
typing this one it is normal electric (87:43 - 87:51)
dry skin is an ability where if you are (87:48 - 87:53)
in our sunlight (87:51 - 87:56)
you're gonna lose an eighth of your HP (87:53 - 87:58)
at the end of each turn if you are in (87:56 - 88:00)
rain you gain an eighth of your ability (87:58 - 88:03)
each turn then in addition if you're hit (88:00 - 88:05)
by a water type move you gain a quarter (88:03 - 88:08)
of your HP back and you're immune to (88:05 - 88:12)
that moves effects you gain a weakness (88:08 - 88:15)
minor weakness to fire type attacks (88:12 - 88:20)
it'll deal 25% more damage and then yeah (88:15 - 88:23)
that's it so a lot of weird effects but (88:20 - 88:25)
essentially the most important ones for (88:23 - 88:28)
our purposes are that gain HP when (88:25 - 88:31)
you're hit by a water move and gain HP (88:28 - 88:35)
and rain because I'm picking this set (88:31 - 88:38)
from Daniel and our Pokemon of the week (88:35 - 88:39)
slack channel because it seems to be the (88:38 - 88:41)
set that has the most sort of input from (88:39 - 88:43)
everyone in the channel it seems to be (88:41 - 88:45)
the sort of culmination of everyone's (88:43 - 88:49)
inputs for heliolisk worth noting (88:45 - 88:51)
heliolisk is legal in the tiny Cup (88:49 - 88:55)
tournament so I've asked folks to pick (88:51 - 88:58)
not only moves up for he needs me panic (88:55 - 89:02)
oh yeah tiny tourney but also pick (88:58 - 89:05)
Pokemon paired it with Pokemon that (89:02 - 89:09)
could also be allowed in the tiny (89:05 - 89:10)
tourney so that's what people have done (89:09 - 89:13)
so this move set from Daniel is (89:10 - 89:16)
heliolisk with choice specs that (89:13 - 89:18)
increases the effectiveness of special (89:16 - 89:21)
attacking moves but locks you in to (89:18 - 89:23)
whatever you choose as your first choice (89:21 - 89:27)
to of a move when you send the Pokemon (89:23 - 89:28)
in if you switch it out and back in you (89:27 - 89:31)
can choose a different move however the (89:28 - 89:35)
V's are going to be 156 and HP 252 in (89:31 - 89:37)
special attack and 100 and speed with a (89:35 - 89:40)
modest nature so we are really maxing (89:37 - 89:42)
out the special attack output of (89:40 - 89:45)
heliolisk and then for the move set (89:42 - 89:46)
you're gonna do hyper voice because you (89:45 - 89:48)
are part normal type as I mentioned so (89:46 - 89:50)
that gives you same type attack bonus (89:48 - 89:53)
thunder because you might be pairing (89:50 - 89:56)
this with something that can set up rain (89:53 - 89:59)
because as I mentioned you've got dry (89:56 - 90:01)
skin so you're healing in the rain and (89:59 - 90:02)
then thunder has (90:01 - 90:04)
percent accuracy in the rain that can (90:02 - 90:07)
deal a lot of damage focus blast is (90:04 - 90:09)
there for coverage especially because (90:07 - 90:13)
you're weak to artists re you're not (90:09 - 90:16)
weak but like hyper voice wouldn't be (90:13 - 90:20)
able to hit steel types or or rock types (90:16 - 90:22)
and electrics not gonna be super (90:20 - 90:25)
effective so focus blast covers a lot of (90:22 - 90:25)
that for you (90:25 - 90:28)
and then lastly you're gonna use surf (90:25 - 90:31)
because you can have that boosted by the (90:28 - 90:33)
rain so it's almost like it gets a same (90:31 - 90:35)
type attack bonus even though you're not (90:33 - 90:38)
water type and then this is where the (90:35 - 90:40)
sort of partner Pokemon come in because (90:38 - 90:43)
you can partner at first with either (90:40 - 90:45)
something with drizzle which I'm not (90:43 - 90:48)
sure exists in the tiny tournament (90:45 - 90:51)
roster I don't think there is one but (90:48 - 90:53)
you can but folks in the slack channel (90:51 - 90:54)
recommend (90:53 - 90:58)
klefki with prankster so that you can (90:54 - 91:01)
use rain dance with increased priority (90:58 - 91:04)
thus boosting the damage output of surf (91:01 - 91:08)
but even better you can pair your (91:04 - 91:11)
heliolisk with you know at maybe after (91:08 - 91:13)
rain is set up you can pair it with a (91:11 - 91:16)
Vaporeon which believe it or not is (91:13 - 91:18)
short enough to be played in tiny (91:16 - 91:22)
tourney and you know the Eevee (91:18 - 91:23)
evolutions have some of the highest base (91:22 - 91:25)
stat total zuv any pokemon you can even (91:23 - 91:29)
use in that format and Vaporeon can have (91:25 - 91:31)
water absorb so you're using surf (91:29 - 91:35)
healing your Vaporeon hitting both of (91:31 - 91:37)
your opponents and it's boosted by the (91:35 - 91:40)
rain and you're being healed by the rain (91:37 - 91:42)
so it's just an all-around great (91:40 - 91:44)
situation your dance floor in the (91:42 - 91:48)
writing heliolisk to uh very one that to (91:44 - 91:50)
save everyone the time there are no (91:48 - 91:52)
pokemon that are small enough that have (91:50 - 91:55)
the drizzle ability thank you for that (91:52 - 91:56)
will because there are only three (91:55 - 91:58)
pokémon that have the drizzle ability (91:56 - 92:00)
and they're all over one meter tall (91:58 - 92:04)
thanks will some trivia here heliolisk (92:00 - 92:06)
is the only pokemon with the base stat (92:04 - 92:09)
total of 481 no other pokemon has the (92:06 - 92:12)
same type combination as heliolisk and (92:09 - 92:16)
it's pre evolutions he Louis is the only (92:12 - 92:19)
on grass type of pokémon to evolve with (92:16 - 92:23)
a Sunstone and Helios is the only (92:19 - 92:25)
Pokemon to have more than five Hangul (92:23 - 92:28)
characters in its Korean name I don't (92:25 - 92:30)
know if I said that word right Hangul (92:28 - 92:33)
yes that's close enough all right the (92:30 - 92:36)
generator Pokemon it's kind of cool (92:33 - 92:39)
like Helio I think from Jurassic Park it (92:36 - 92:41)
looks a lot like the thing from Jurassic (92:39 - 92:43)
Park yeah yeah not the Velociraptor but (92:41 - 92:46)
no no the thing that like attacks Newman (92:43 - 92:50)
in the Porta Potty Newman yeah and (92:46 - 92:53)
shoots the like weird acid at his face (92:50 - 92:55)
which apparently I wrote I'm dinosaur on (92:53 - 92:57)
which it's based can't actually do (92:55 - 92:58)
anything close to that (92:57 - 93:04)
I don't know that actor's name I just (92:58 - 93:06)
know him as Newman yeah I don't know it (93:04 - 93:09)
either ah you didn't say the magic word (93:06 - 93:13)

keep that dog clean in 2017 I forgot to (95:24 - 95:28)
mention another thing that really (95:27 - 95:30)
bothers me about Magikarp jump and (95:28 - 95:33)
that's that if you upgrade the most (95:30 - 95:35)
common berry to the extent that it (95:33 - 95:39)
provides more JP than the berry that is (95:35 - 95:42)
then the berry that's one tier stronger (95:39 - 95:44)
than it it will actually start spawning (95:42 - 95:47)
more of that second tier berry because (95:44 - 95:50)
it gives you less I spent that coin (95:47 - 95:53)
hard-earned coin on that first berry (95:50 - 95:55)
because you give me so much of it so of (95:53 - 95:56)
course I'm gonna wanna upgrade that one (95:55 - 95:58)
so you can't swindle me like this (95:56 - 96:01)
