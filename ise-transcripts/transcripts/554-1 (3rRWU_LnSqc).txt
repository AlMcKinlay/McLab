technically our episode should be nine (1:42 - 1:45)
minutes long I talk a lot ends up being (1:44 - 1:47)
two hours uh so instead of giving you (1:45 - 1:49)
guys an episode of 90 minutes on Monday (1:47 - 1:52)
which would be recorded on Sunday we're (1:49 - 1:53)
recording on Saturday to give you an (1:52 - 1:56)
episode on Sunday so we can talk about (1:53 - 1:59)

then you don't have to wait a full week (2:15 - 2:20)
for Pokemon Day thoughts (2:17 - 2:22)
um sorry so and then I didn't want to (2:20 - 2:24)
skip an episode on Monday because then (2:22 - 2:25)
you guys would be like where's the (2:24 - 2:27)
episode so you're getting an episode a (2:25 - 2:29)
day early to tell you that there will be (2:27 - 2:31)
no episode on Monday it is now you're (2:29 - 2:33)
listening to it in your ears on Sunday (2:31 - 2:37)
and then you'll get another one probably (2:33 - 2:40)
on Tuesday so I don't want to hear (2:37 - 2:42)
anything about it on Twitter but if you (2:40 - 2:44)
want to tweet at me just tweet me nice (2:42 - 2:46)
things instead like oh I enjoyed the the (2:44 - 2:48)
Sunday episode you might be making it (2:46 - 2:51)
more complicated than it actually is I'm (2:48 - 2:54)
not sure it's a special at this point (2:51 - 2:56)
it's a special week for Pokemon day (2:54 - 2:58)
that's the short sure and if you're (2:56 - 3:00)
listening to this on Sunday I'll be (2:58 - 3:02)
streaming my reaction to uh Pokemon day (3:00 - 3:04)
I'll also be streaming pretty much all (3:02 - 3:05)
day on Pokemon day until we get to the (3:04 - 3:07)
evening where and I'll stop streaming so (3:05 - 3:10)
we can record the podcast Tuesday you (3:07 - 3:13)
know there's a lot of content uh and you (3:10 - 3:14)
probably know where to find it so for (3:13 - 3:16)
this episode uh we're gonna be talking (3:14 - 3:19)
about the Seven Star raid Pikachu which (3:16 - 3:21)
got announced very quickly and then (3:19 - 3:23)
happened and there I don't believe as of (3:21 - 3:25)
right now we don't know if there's a (3:23 - 3:26)
second weekend like the other Seven Star (3:25 - 3:27)
raids (3:26 - 3:29)
um and then we're gonna be talking about (3:27 - 3:33)
the Hoenn Global thingy that happened (3:29 - 3:34)
this weekend so those are the two things (3:33 - 3:36)
we're going to try to tackle there was (3:34 - 3:37)
some anime news we'll see if we can get (3:36 - 3:38)
to it (3:37 - 3:40)
um but let's start off with the Seven (3:38 - 3:43)
Star Pikachu uh this was to celebrate (3:40 - 3:46)
Pokemon day uh this is the fourth Seven (3:43 - 3:49)
Star raid uh I did a bunch of raid (3:46 - 3:52)
builds like always I I (3:49 - 3:55)
built Pokemon assuming the Pikachu had (3:52 - 3:57)
light ball it did so the Takeover way (3:55 - 4:00)
here is uh they can give raid bosses (3:57 - 4:03)
held items that's that's good or bad (4:00 - 4:04)
maybe (4:03 - 4:06)
and they can build them to be a whole (4:04 - 4:09)
lot stronger than you expect yeah uh and (4:06 - 4:11)
then I predicted Pikachu would have (4:09 - 4:12)
lightning rod I think that was pretty (4:11 - 4:14)
obvious (4:12 - 4:17)
um because it was water type Tara (4:14 - 4:19)
so (4:17 - 4:19)
um (4:19 - 4:23)
it seemed like the consensus was people (4:19 - 4:25)
were not excited because it wasn't (4:23 - 4:26)
um (4:25 - 4:28)
like a Pokemon that didn't already exist (4:26 - 4:29)
I didn't want I don't want to use the (4:28 - 4:30)
word new Pokemon because there's nothing (4:29 - 4:32)
new about Charizard and there's nothing (4:30 - 4:34)
new about cinderes but (4:32 - 4:39)
yes uh non-paladea Dex Pokemon uh and I (4:34 - 4:40)
think a lot of people (4:39 - 4:44)
also were just like oh Pikachu's easy (4:40 - 4:45)
um because he's not a fully evolved (4:44 - 4:47)
Pokemon (4:45 - 4:48)
um but I think the whole takeaway from (4:47 - 4:51)
this conversation isn't to be like (4:48 - 4:53)
thank goodness iron hands doesn't work (4:51 - 4:54)
because well people still brought iron (4:53 - 4:57)
hands anyways (4:54 - 4:57)
somebody didn't listen to Hops dialogue (4:59 - 5:04)
uh to be well I mean the ability was the (5:01 - 5:06)
one that stopped it uh I think the (5:04 - 5:08)
takeaway though that I want to talk (5:06 - 5:11)
about is that for the first three seven (5:08 - 5:13)
star raids they were pretty much the (5:11 - 5:16)
same mechanically and what I mean by (5:13 - 5:19)
that is they had the same HP uh they (5:16 - 5:21)
they had Shields they had a (5:19 - 5:24)
opportunities to reset your stats to (5:21 - 5:26)
reset their stats to (5:24 - 5:30)
um shut off your ability for a turn (5:26 - 5:32)
and (5:30 - 5:34)
you could only catch one it has the (5:32 - 5:36)
mightiest Mark uh which you know some (5:34 - 5:37)
people care about marks some people (5:36 - 5:40)
don't I care about marks a lot (5:37 - 5:42)
um but there was a lot of changes to (5:40 - 5:45)
this Pikachu under the hood which is (5:42 - 5:48)
whether or not you did Pikachu or like I (5:45 - 5:49)
don't you didn't care about marks you (5:48 - 5:51)
didn't care about Pikachu (5:49 - 5:54)
that's totally cool but I think all the (5:51 - 5:55)
things they did under the hood make (5:54 - 5:57)
potential Seven Star raids even more (5:55 - 6:00)
exciting (5:57 - 6:00)
oh this is probably where I talk about (6:01 - 6:05)
what they're changing what they changed (6:03 - 6:08)
I mean like yeah I was gonna say did you (6:05 - 6:11)
guys do the Pikachu I did one uh this (6:08 - 6:13)
week ended up being a little bit busier (6:11 - 6:14)
because we got we get more snow than (6:13 - 6:16)
this city has seen in a very long time (6:14 - 6:19)
and so that kind of threw the latter (6:16 - 6:21)
half of my week off and I ended up doing (6:19 - 6:23)
one Pikachu raid with people from slack (6:21 - 6:25)
with one of my Claude sire from the (6:23 - 6:28)
Greninja raids and worked out just fine (6:25 - 6:30)
I got stuck in a menu for half of it (6:28 - 6:33)
that didn't matter They Carried me (6:30 - 6:36)
got all stuck in a menu that I'm glad (6:33 - 6:37)
that that one hasn't changed over the (6:36 - 6:40)
it's supposed to get better we'll see (6:37 - 6:43)
that's true I was I was expecting that (6:40 - 6:46)
um we would either get the patch because (6:43 - 6:48)
they did put out patch notes and I was (6:46 - 6:49)
like oh we should talk about the patch (6:48 - 6:50)
notes (6:49 - 6:51)
I expected the patch to actually come (6:50 - 6:54)
this Thursday with a potential new raid (6:51 - 6:56)
boss because they know they have done (6:54 - 6:58)
Thursday updates before (6:56 - 7:01)
uh and there was no patch so it's (6:58 - 7:03)
possible I got stuck in a menu as well (7:01 - 7:05)
during one of my Pikachus so uh they're (7:03 - 7:08)
running out of February (7:05 - 7:12)
so I'm assuming the patch is on Monday (7:08 - 7:14)
which at that point we're recording a (7:12 - 7:16)
podcast on Monday night it will be out (7:14 - 7:20)
on Tuesday Morning yep news again please (7:16 - 7:24)
talk about the bad sir Okay so (7:20 - 7:27)
the first the first thing is seven star (7:24 - 7:30)
raid bosses are normally 30 times the (7:27 - 7:31)
amount of HP (7:30 - 7:33)
uh so Charizard Greninja (7:31 - 7:36)
race 30 times the amount of HP uh and (7:33 - 7:38)
then six star raid bosses I I can't (7:36 - 7:40)
remember like 20 times and then five (7:38 - 7:42)
star raid bosses are like 10 times so (7:40 - 7:44)
those are all been stagnant and the same (7:42 - 7:46)
and as up to this point seven star raid (7:44 - 7:47)
bosses have always been 30 times the (7:46 - 7:50)
amount of Health they normally have (7:47 - 7:54)
and my thought was like well if they (7:50 - 7:56)
were ever to release a legendary Pokemon (7:54 - 8:00)
like Rayquaza or Mewtwo how could they (7:56 - 8:03)
make it harder if we already know what a (8:00 - 8:06)
seven star raid can hold or contain like (8:03 - 8:08)
the rules of the air quoting the rules (8:06 - 8:10)
of a seven star raid and instead of a (8:08 - 8:13)
legendary they did it with Pikachu yeah (8:10 - 8:16)
so uh so the Seven Star raids don't have (8:13 - 8:19)
set rules uh because Pikachu had 50 (8:16 - 8:21)
times the amount of HP uh so there (8:19 - 8:23)
didn't need to be like a magical eight (8:21 - 8:25)
star raid they're just like we can just (8:23 - 8:27)
change this so again if you didn't do (8:25 - 8:30)
Pikachu no that's not the that's not the (8:27 - 8:32)
takeaway here is they they can change (8:30 - 8:35)
these numbers and and flex it the other (8:32 - 8:37)
thing that I think everyone noticed (8:35 - 8:39)
right away is Pikachu started with a (8:37 - 8:43)
shield instantly which again (8:39 - 8:46)
um this was something I speculated in uh (8:43 - 8:48)
a month or two ago I actually made a (8:46 - 8:50)
YouTube video about this uh because I (8:48 - 8:52)
wanted to teach people how the shield (8:50 - 8:54)
worked I can't remember what that I (8:52 - 8:55)
think the YouTube video is called like (8:54 - 8:57)
behind the scenes of a seven star raid (8:55 - 8:59)
or something and I talked about how like (8:57 - 9:01)
it's important to learn the shield (8:59 - 9:03)
mechanic because if the shield starts (9:01 - 9:06)
earlier or I don't know on turn zero you (9:03 - 9:08)
now have to deal with it and if you (9:06 - 9:09)
don't know how to deal with it which (9:08 - 9:12)
which I think was probably the biggest (9:09 - 9:15)
hurdle for a lot of trainers (9:12 - 9:16)
um they're like why am I not doing a lot (9:15 - 9:18)
of damage like What's Happening Here uh (9:16 - 9:20)
then that raid all of a sudden becomes (9:18 - 9:21)
hard (9:20 - 9:23)
and (9:21 - 9:25)
there is a lot of novelty into like (9:23 - 9:28)
one-shotting a raid boss (9:25 - 9:29)
um (9:28 - 9:30)
but I think (9:29 - 9:32)
that wasn't so much a novelty for some (9:30 - 9:34)
people that was I don't want to deal (9:32 - 9:38)
with the raid Shield how can I do this (9:34 - 9:40)
without having the raid Shield pop up (9:38 - 9:44)
because people didn't understand or want (9:40 - 9:45)
to deal with the right Shield because (9:44 - 9:47)
once the rate Shields up it does become (9:45 - 9:49)
harder right like you can't taunt you (9:47 - 9:51)
can't thunderwave uh people were (9:49 - 9:52)
building Pokemon before Pikachu to be (9:51 - 9:54)
like I want to skill swap the the hidden (9:52 - 9:56)
ability off so that I can use electric (9:54 - 9:57)
Pokemon (9:56 - 10:00)
can't skill swap when a shield is up so (9:57 - 10:02)
so far we got two things number one uh (10:00 - 10:03)
they can put the shield wherever they (10:02 - 10:06)
want the shield was Stronger too yes (10:03 - 10:09)
yeah we're gonna talk about that so held (10:06 - 10:09)
item (10:09 - 10:13)
uh possible uh Shield can go wherever it (10:09 - 10:17)
wants more HP uh and then the other (10:13 - 10:19)
thing is The Shield was Stronger but (10:17 - 10:21)
weaker at the same time which was kind (10:19 - 10:22)
of weird (10:21 - 10:25)
so uh I'm gonna I'm gonna give you guys (10:22 - 10:27)
a this might go through some people's (10:25 - 10:28)
ears and not the other (10:27 - 10:31)
but I'll give I'll give you a too long (10:28 - 10:33)
didn't read so again this was in my (10:31 - 10:35)
video of like how to deal with the raid (10:33 - 10:36)
Shield so when you're attacking a (10:35 - 10:39)
Pokemon that has a shield up your move (10:36 - 10:41)
is only doing 20 of the potential damage (10:39 - 10:43)
so I'll make this really easy uh you (10:41 - 10:44)
know if you're using earthquake (10:43 - 10:46)
earthquake does a hundred damage if a (10:44 - 10:48)
Pokemon Shield is up your earthquake's (10:46 - 10:49)
only doing 20 damage right that's like a (10:48 - 10:52)
huge reduction of damage (10:49 - 10:54)
and then if you trust lies uh let's (10:52 - 10:56)
we'll use clotire for example if you (10:54 - 10:59)
tracelize and you use trailblaze uh (10:56 - 11:01)
trailblaze you know cloth sires not (10:59 - 11:03)
grass or (11:01 - 11:05)
poison (11:03 - 11:07)
so it's not a it's not a stab (11:05 - 11:10)
um it's also not so if you sorry so if (11:07 - 11:12)
you try slice ground because we're going (11:10 - 11:14)
to use earthquake still and you use (11:12 - 11:17)
trailblaze you're only doing 35 of the (11:14 - 11:19)
potential damage Trailblazer is really (11:17 - 11:21)
weak though so I'm not going to do math (11:19 - 11:24)
on that but if you teracelize ground and (11:21 - 11:26)
use earthquake because earthquake (11:24 - 11:29)
matches ground you're going to do 75 of (11:26 - 11:31)
the potential damage so instead of your (11:29 - 11:33)
earthquake doing 20 against the Shield (11:31 - 11:35)
your earthquake is doing 75 against the (11:33 - 11:37)
Shield so you're still not even doing (11:35 - 11:39)
the full potential of what earthquake (11:37 - 11:41)
can do now of course same type attack (11:39 - 11:43)
bonus all that stuff you know held items (11:41 - 11:45)
into play but that's like the basics of (11:43 - 11:47)
the shield and how it works Pikachu had (11:45 - 11:50)
a unique Shield so again the takeaway (11:47 - 11:54)
here is raid bosses in the future like (11:50 - 11:56)
if they decide to do a Mewtwo could have (11:54 - 12:00)
a totally unique Shield mechanic than a (11:56 - 12:02)
cinder Ace or a grid Ninja (12:00 - 12:03)
so (12:02 - 12:07)
Pikachu your base attacks did one (12:03 - 12:10)
percent damage to Pikachu's Shield (12:07 - 12:12)
so your earthquake instead of doing 20 (12:10 - 12:16)
damage out of 100 it did one damage that (12:12 - 12:18)
was it and you might have noticed this (12:16 - 12:20)
with like a giga drain or a shell Bell (12:18 - 12:22)
that you weren't getting any HP back (12:20 - 12:25)
really it forces you to understand how (12:22 - 12:28)
the shield Works yes (12:25 - 12:29)
you're not going to get any Headway (12:28 - 12:30)
otherwise (12:29 - 12:32)
so (12:30 - 12:35)
um so if you were using uh we'll go back (12:32 - 12:38)
to Cloud sire if if you ground Tara (12:35 - 12:40)
clothsire and use trailblaze your (12:38 - 12:42)
Trailblazer is doing 70 of the potential (12:40 - 12:44)
damage now earlier I said it was only (12:42 - 12:47)
doing 35 so they actually gave (12:44 - 12:49)
non-terror matching moves a boost (12:47 - 12:51)
against the Shield I think what game (12:49 - 12:53)
freak was really doing was like (12:51 - 12:55)
you need to tracelize you need to use (12:53 - 12:57)
the mechanic we invented to do some (12:55 - 13:00)
damage here and then if you did match (12:57 - 13:04)
the Terra uh so Cloud sire (13:00 - 13:05)
um (13:04 - 13:08)
ground Terra using earthquake you would (13:05 - 13:10)
actually do a hundred and twenty percent (13:08 - 13:11)
of the normal damage so you're actually (13:10 - 13:15)
doing more than (13:11 - 13:17)
um what earthquake can normally do I I (13:15 - 13:20)
don't know what 120 and 100 is I don't (13:17 - 13:21)
know if that boosts it to 120 or if it's (13:20 - 13:22)
a little bit higher but you're just (13:21 - 13:24)
doing more damage than what it would do (13:22 - 13:26)
um (13:24 - 13:29)
so that makes sense now why if you (13:26 - 13:31)
brought a grass type Pokemon and you (13:29 - 13:34)
tracelized grass and then you got it you (13:31 - 13:37)
did 120 of what that damage was plus (13:34 - 13:40)
super effective plus stab that's why (13:37 - 13:43)
grass type Pokemon completely melted (13:40 - 13:45)
Pikachu because (13:43 - 13:47)
uh I don't know if you guys know this (13:45 - 13:51)
but water type Pokemon are weak to grass (13:47 - 13:53)
I know it's crazy (13:51 - 13:59)
shocking news did not realize this wow (13:53 - 13:59)
um so yeah again if you didn't find (14:00 - 14:06)
Pikachu to be exciting I think the most (14:03 - 14:07)
exciting thing is they can give Pokemon (14:06 - 14:09)
hell items they can change the shield (14:07 - 14:11)
they can change the health (14:09 - 14:14)
um they can make the shield activate or (14:11 - 14:15)
not activate Pikachu never reset your (14:14 - 14:18)
stats this is the first seven star raid (14:15 - 14:20)
boss to never reset your stats he did (14:18 - 14:22)
reset his stats he it was also the first (14:20 - 14:25)
seven star raid boss to not remove your (14:22 - 14:26)
ability for a turn although probably (14:25 - 14:29)
wouldn't have mattered too much (14:26 - 14:31)
um oh and he was holding a held at him (14:29 - 14:32)
which (14:31 - 14:36)
knockoff did work so if you were running (14:32 - 14:39)
a miascarata or a wo Chen or a totes (14:36 - 14:40)
girl those are the three grass type (14:39 - 14:42)
Pokemon I'm thinking off the top of my (14:40 - 14:44)
head um they all had knockoff so that (14:42 - 14:45)
would remove the light bulb which makes (14:44 - 14:47)
Pikachu significantly weaker obviously (14:45 - 14:49)
without the light ball (14:47 - 14:50)
so (14:49 - 14:53)
um yeah again I didn't think Pikachu was (14:50 - 14:54)
the most exciting raid boss although I (14:53 - 14:57)
am a big Pikachu fan oh there's one more (14:54 - 15:00)
thing about Pikachu holy cow so (14:57 - 15:03)
so the Charizard Greninja Cinder ice (15:00 - 15:05)
they were all male (15:03 - 15:08)
um and everyone got the same nature (15:05 - 15:09)
right so like Charizard was always (15:08 - 15:12)
modest Greninja was always sassy uh and (15:09 - 15:13)
then they had the mightiest of Mark (15:12 - 15:16)
right for just a side note if I saw this (15:13 - 15:17)
all the time on Instagram or Tick Tock (15:16 - 15:19)
they're like I don't have a mark you (15:17 - 15:21)
have to move it to your party yeah and (15:19 - 15:23)
then I think the update is supposed to (15:21 - 15:27)
fit yeah hopefully (15:23 - 15:27)
um but this (15:28 - 15:34)
had a 1 in 16 chance of being a big (15:30 - 15:37)
Pikachu it had the it could it could (15:34 - 15:39)
have the humongo Mark (15:37 - 15:41)
um (15:39 - 15:44)
so this Pikachu literally made me put in (15:41 - 15:46)
my copy of scarlet run through the (15:44 - 15:48)
beginning of the game to then catch (15:46 - 15:51)
another Pikachu because I learned it (15:48 - 15:53)
after I already caught a Pikachu and I (15:51 - 15:56)
wanted a mighty Mark Pikachu but also a (15:53 - 16:00)
humongo mark Pikachu I wanted both (15:56 - 16:00)
it's a good word it's a good word and (16:05 - 16:10)
then when it comes out it'll say Pikachu (16:08 - 16:11)
the great I think is what the title is (16:10 - 16:14)
which is really great on great Tusk (16:11 - 16:17)
because it's great test the Great (16:14 - 16:17)
so wait okay (16:17 - 16:21)
all right (16:19 - 16:24)
um so wait how did you (16:21 - 16:26)
how did you get the Pikachu with the (16:24 - 16:29)
humongo mark uh because you wouldn't be (16:26 - 16:30)
able to figure that out until after (16:29 - 16:32)
you've finished the raid right yes you (16:30 - 16:35)
have to turn off auto save (16:32 - 16:37)
so the game will the game will save when (16:35 - 16:38)
you connect to the internet (16:37 - 16:40)
um but if auto save is off it doesn't (16:38 - 16:41)
save after the raid so you catch the (16:40 - 16:43)
Pikachu you talk to the girl by the (16:41 - 16:46)
flower garden she'll be like this is the (16:43 - 16:47)
biggest I've ever seen and then if she (16:46 - 16:49)
does if she doesn't say that you have to (16:47 - 16:51)
like turn it off turn it back on (16:49 - 16:53)
classic Pokemon you know every Pokemon (16:51 - 16:56)
trainer knows this this uh song and (16:53 - 16:58)
dance turn it off turn back on how many (16:56 - 16:59)
times did you have to do that I got (16:58 - 17:01)
lucky it was my first one on my new (16:59 - 17:04)
account what yeah that's awesome okay (17:01 - 17:06)
yeah I mean and the odds are good (17:04 - 17:08)
everyone yeah one in 16 is really good (17:06 - 17:10)
uh everyone in the raid would get the (17:08 - 17:12)
same humongo Mark so if somebody that's (17:10 - 17:14)
helpful if somebody if I came back and I (17:12 - 17:17)
was like oh I got the humongo mark the (17:14 - 17:20)
person who was hosting it could then (17:17 - 17:21)
keep posting that over and over (17:20 - 17:24)
technically right right (17:21 - 17:24)
about the marks what about the marks (17:26 - 17:33)
and we'll see what comes next whether (17:31 - 17:34)
it's more Pikachu or whether it's (17:33 - 17:36)
something else (17:34 - 17:39)
well speaking of Pikachu they put two (17:36 - 17:42)
new hat Pikachus in the wild uh one is a (17:39 - 17:44)
mayhat Pikachu the other is a Brendan (17:42 - 17:46)
hat Pikachu how (17:44 - 17:51)
was your guys day one Hoenn tour (17:46 - 17:54)
uh don't be too excited the best way to (17:51 - 17:56)
put it is like you got like you've got (17:54 - 17:57)
overwhelming you've got underwhelming (17:56 - 18:00)
like I was whelmed like it was fine it (17:57 - 18:03)
like I didn't think it was (18:00 - 18:06)
awesome like I wasn't like oh this is so (18:03 - 18:08)
great like Johto tour Kanto tour were (18:06 - 18:11)
definitely better those also cost 12 15 (18:08 - 18:14)
bucks or whatever uh so there's that uh (18:11 - 18:17)
I think DOTA tour was 12 or like 11.99 (18:14 - 18:19)
um I think you're right (18:17 - 18:22)
what was five five was like a grow Fest (18:19 - 18:24)
for the fifth year because Verizon or (18:22 - 18:26)
Google Play sponsored that ghost yeah (18:24 - 18:28)
that was it yeah that was five but I'm (18:26 - 18:31)
pretty jodo tour was 11.99 I'm I'm (18:28 - 18:32)
pretty confident I don't remember what (18:31 - 18:34)
Kanto tour was (18:32 - 18:37)
but this definitely played (18:34 - 18:41)
like a free event yep no it was free it (18:37 - 18:42)
was no I know first kind of Community (18:41 - 18:45)
Day in some ways there was no bonus it (18:42 - 18:47)
was just go out and catch Pokemon and (18:45 - 18:49)
also if you want to take advantage of (18:47 - 18:51)
the megas you can spend a whole bunch of (18:49 - 18:54)
money on Reigns yeah so I say it was a (18:51 - 18:55)
free event I was not free for me because (18:54 - 18:58)
I did about like 20 uh Primal raids (18:55 - 19:01)
throughout the day uh and none of them (18:58 - 19:02)
were with the premium passes they were (19:01 - 19:04)
all remote because they were not there (19:02 - 19:06)
with other people so people aren't (19:04 - 19:08)
around I like how people are considering (19:06 - 19:09)
premium passes free at this point (19:08 - 19:11)
because everyone just has like 40 in (19:09 - 19:13)
their bag I'm trying to get rid of them (19:11 - 19:15)
[Laughter] (19:13 - 19:17)
60 some odd premium passes in my bag (19:15 - 19:20)
from three years ago but (19:17 - 19:23)
yeah it was again it was fine I I one of (19:20 - 19:26)
the so it's raining right now it hasn't (19:23 - 19:28)
rained all week but of course today it's (19:26 - 19:30)
like poor it was pouring rain all day (19:28 - 19:34)
um so what I did do at one point was get (19:30 - 19:37)
in my car and find like where a kecleon (19:34 - 19:39)
was on a stop (19:37 - 19:41)
go to that stop and then catch the (19:39 - 19:43)
kecleon and then catch like anything (19:41 - 19:44)
around there right because there's a lot (19:43 - 19:45)
of Pokemon will be spawning in those (19:44 - 19:48)
areas and then go to the next keckley on (19:45 - 19:51)
and I did that for about 15 kecleon (19:48 - 19:52)
um none of them were shiny unfortunately (19:51 - 19:54)
but (19:52 - 19:55)
um that was okay and then I just caught (19:54 - 19:56)
a bunch of Pokemon that are around (19:55 - 19:59)
wherever the kecleon were so Keck Leon (19:56 - 20:01)
kind of like LED my day today today (19:59 - 20:03)
honestly that's that sounds like kind of (20:01 - 20:05)
a fun way to do it (20:03 - 20:07)
I worked out (20:05 - 20:09)
I think I mean I already said that my my (20:07 - 20:11)
city got more snow than we're used to (20:09 - 20:13)
and that means the entire city is (20:11 - 20:15)
covered in ice so the challenge for me (20:13 - 20:19)
was traversing and getting around and (20:15 - 20:20)
not falling (20:19 - 20:22)
and so everything was kind of slow I (20:20 - 20:25)
ended up with three shinies day one I (20:22 - 20:28)
got a Feebas and a Brendan hat Pikachu (20:25 - 20:31)
and a Cacnea and those are the three (20:28 - 20:33)
that I got and I am almost all the way (20:31 - 20:35)
through the research and I got three out (20:33 - 20:39)
of four of the uh (20:35 - 20:41)
collection challenge is done so tomorrow (20:39 - 20:43)
I'm looking for a slack off and I need (20:41 - 20:45)
to do a bunch of Kyogre raids (20:43 - 20:48)
so ultimately I felt like this was a (20:45 - 20:49)
good (20:48 - 20:52)
amount of content but it didn't set it (20:49 - 20:53)
didn't feel fun (20:52 - 20:55)
there weren't bonuses going on there (20:53 - 20:58)
weren't really things to aim for but I (20:55 - 21:00)
do think one thing I noticed was that (20:58 - 21:02)
there were multiple new shinies with (21:00 - 21:05)
this event right yeah and that was one (21:02 - 21:07)
thing that I think they probably heard (21:05 - 21:09)
everybody complaining last time (21:07 - 21:11)
because they last time kind of released (21:09 - 21:13)
shinies all the way up to the Johto (21:11 - 21:15)
event and there weren't any new shinies (21:13 - 21:18)
there were barely any new shinies (21:15 - 21:22)
a couple but yeah very very few in in (21:18 - 21:24)
the Johto yeah in the Johto tour and (21:22 - 21:25)
this one there are at least some new (21:24 - 21:28)
shinies so that's good so did you pick (21:25 - 21:31)
the Cacnea line I did okay yes Steve (21:28 - 21:33)
what did you pick I like Gulpin you (21:31 - 21:35)
picked Gulpin and you got shiny Gulpin (21:33 - 21:37)
right and then it wasn't guaranteed (21:35 - 21:39)
though I don't think it was but I picked (21:37 - 21:42)
it was either and I think it's first the (21:39 - 21:44)
first surskit uh research reward was (21:42 - 21:48)
shiny for me but it seems like that was (21:44 - 21:50)
like it seems like that that Pokemon (21:48 - 21:51)
when you chose that path had like a (21:50 - 21:54)
shiny boost of some kind because I was (21:51 - 21:56)
seeing a lot of that (21:54 - 21:58)
um today like YouTube someone had (21:56 - 21:59)
cackney but nothing else right someone (21:58 - 22:03)
had shiny Gulpin but nothing else so I (21:59 - 22:04)
think there must have been some kind of (22:03 - 22:05)
boost there (22:04 - 22:07)
I'm kind of surprised it didn't break (22:05 - 22:09)
anything (22:07 - 22:09)
yeah I I don't think I heard any uh (22:10 - 22:15)
issues for this event (22:13 - 22:19)
uh the that's not true there were I did (22:15 - 22:21)
see people being like hey the game is (22:19 - 22:23)
broken I can't figure out what these (22:21 - 22:24)
quests are (22:23 - 22:27)
you know the spooky ciphers people were (22:24 - 22:29)
complaining about the spooky Cipher and (22:27 - 22:32)
not being able to like figure it like (22:29 - 22:33)
someone asked me about it and asked what (22:32 - 22:35)
it was and I said they tried to make it (22:33 - 22:37)
fun and failed (22:35 - 22:37)
um (22:37 - 22:41)
yeah I took one look at that said nope (22:37 - 22:43)
went online looked it up what are these (22:41 - 22:46)
tasks it was it's a little annoying (22:43 - 22:49)
because they replaced each letter with a (22:46 - 22:51)
black box which meant that the spacing (22:49 - 22:54)
was off so the the spacing you would (22:51 - 22:56)
expect for each word was different than (22:54 - 22:57)
it would be which made reading them (22:56 - 22:58)
harder (22:57 - 23:00)
yeah (22:58 - 23:02)
I think the ones that were more (23:00 - 23:04)
intuitive were the make three great (23:02 - 23:06)
throws and use berries because it would (23:04 - 23:08)
pop up and then you would slowly figure (23:06 - 23:09)
it out I guess if you're paying (23:08 - 23:12)
attention yeah (23:09 - 23:14)
you can take the harder look yeah the (23:12 - 23:16)
only one I that I struggled with when I (23:14 - 23:17)
was in Vegas was the it ended up being (23:16 - 23:19)
transferred by Pokemon because I wasn't (23:17 - 23:21)
trying I cleared my storage so I wasn't (23:19 - 23:23)
planning on transferring anything until (23:21 - 23:26)
you know I got back that night so I like (23:23 - 23:28)
I kept getting them and I was like (23:26 - 23:29)
finally I asked somebody I was like what (23:28 - 23:30)
is this and they're like oh transfer and (23:29 - 23:31)
I was like oh I'd even think about (23:30 - 23:33)
transferring because I I cleared my (23:31 - 23:35)
storage before the event but like to (23:33 - 23:36)
make three great and use five berries (23:35 - 23:39)
that was like oh because I'm I've been (23:36 - 23:41)
doing that right like uh and then the (23:39 - 23:44)
evolved Nakata I guess that one was like (23:41 - 23:47)
the easiest for me to like read (23:44 - 23:47)
that's true (23:57 - 24:01)
but yeah I didn't even give it a second (24:00 - 24:04)
like as soon as I saw the task and then (24:01 - 24:05)
saw that it said like Cipher I was like (24:04 - 24:08)
oh okay I'm not gonna sit here and try (24:05 - 24:10)
to solve this puzzle you know and then (24:08 - 24:11)
on top of that (24:10 - 24:12)
um (24:11 - 24:14)
you know with the great throws right (24:12 - 24:15)
over every time I'm catching a Pokemon (24:14 - 24:17)
it's saying like you've completed three (24:15 - 24:19)
tasks because it's completing the (24:17 - 24:21)
Jirachi (24:19 - 24:24)
one oh yeah yeah 300 of each Pokemon or (24:21 - 24:25)
whatever and then completing whatever (24:24 - 24:27)
other stuff so I wasn't even taking the (24:25 - 24:29)
time to think like oh what three tasks (24:27 - 24:32)
are being completed on this catch so (24:29 - 24:33)
just went straight to the internet and (24:32 - 24:36)
said what are these tasks uh so I have (24:33 - 24:38)
two different experiences because I went (24:36 - 24:40)
to Vegas uh I will disclose that uh (24:38 - 24:43)
Niantic did pay for my two-day ticket in (24:40 - 24:45)
Vegas they did not (24:43 - 24:48)
pay for my flight or my hotel that was (24:45 - 24:50)
all that was all on me they did not pay (24:48 - 24:52)
for any of my dinners at Gordon Ramsay's (24:50 - 24:54)
burger place that place was very good (24:52 - 24:56)
very good um very good it was also (24:54 - 24:57)
probably the cheapest Gordon Ramsay (24:56 - 24:59)
place I think that exists because it's (24:57 - 25:02)
just him because this is a burger spot (24:59 - 25:02)
um so yes they did pay for they did pay (25:02 - 25:06)
for my ticket they also gave me a couple (25:04 - 25:08)
incubators and raid passes which to be (25:06 - 25:10)
fair I don't you know the raid passes (25:08 - 25:11)
are just eating my storage because I (25:10 - 25:12)
can't get I can't get through rate (25:11 - 25:14)
passes I I there were they weren't (25:12 - 25:16)
remote raid passes they were premium and (25:14 - 25:18)
uh I I just have storage wasted at this (25:16 - 25:21)
point but they didn't give me some they (25:18 - 25:22)
gave you oh well you were in Vegas but (25:21 - 25:24)
it's like yeah yeah and said move around (25:22 - 25:27)
go outside (25:24 - 25:28)
um (25:27 - 25:31)
so I I had totally different experiences (25:28 - 25:33)
obviously the shiny odds were much much (25:31 - 25:35)
better in Vegas (25:33 - 25:38)
um but I will say today doing it I mean (25:35 - 25:40)
so there there are similarities between (25:38 - 25:42)
the Kanto and the Johto right like or at (25:40 - 25:44)
least other past events the rotating (25:42 - 25:46)
every hour (25:44 - 25:50)
um I think is still a good tactic (25:46 - 25:51)
um (25:50 - 25:53)
for (25:51 - 25:55)
I think there is some pros and cons of (25:53 - 25:57)
having the event be exactly the same for (25:55 - 25:59)
two days for eight hours two days like (25:57 - 26:00)
for a free event you know you think of (25:59 - 26:02)
community day as like three hours only (26:00 - 26:05)
on Saturday oh I'm working I can't do it (26:02 - 26:06)
um so I think for a free event 16 hours (26:05 - 26:09)
over the weekend some people are gonna (26:06 - 26:10)
do all 16 hours some people are gonna do (26:09 - 26:14)
four some are gonna do six right like I (26:10 - 26:16)
think I think those are still Pros (26:14 - 26:17)
um (26:16 - 26:19)
I think they did a great job with (26:17 - 26:22)
starters uh they weren't completely (26:19 - 26:25)
everywhere littering the entire thing (26:22 - 26:27)
what was that Johto tour where no that (26:25 - 26:29)
was going fast that was go Fest where (26:27 - 26:32)
there was Sun and Moon starters littered (26:29 - 26:33)
everywhere it didn't make sense because (26:32 - 26:36)
it can't be shiny yep (26:33 - 26:37)
um (26:36 - 26:39)
so I think I think they did a great job (26:37 - 26:40)
with the starters they took dust skull (26:39 - 26:41)
they put it behind one of the ciphers (26:40 - 26:43)
which was another Community Day shiny (26:41 - 26:47)
which I thought was a good choice to (26:43 - 26:48)
um so at the other two go fast they put (26:47 - 26:50)
corsola (26:48 - 26:52)
you know Kangaskhan farfetch all that (26:50 - 26:54)
stuff in raids (26:52 - 26:55)
um (26:54 - 26:57)
and they didn't do it here and they put (26:55 - 26:59)
it in eggs and I don't know (26:57 - 27:02)
I think that's 50 50 because like if (26:59 - 27:05)
they put them in raids then you have (27:02 - 27:06)
well you have to spend the money either (27:05 - 27:08)
way right (27:06 - 27:10)
but like if they put them in raids and (27:08 - 27:11)
your town only has two raids and you (27:10 - 27:13)
want Kyogre and ground on more (27:11 - 27:17)
and they keep spawning a Tropius there (27:13 - 27:19)
yeah this is a pretty raid heavy event (27:17 - 27:21)
if you care about the primals (27:19 - 27:23)
people and we know we know people do (27:21 - 27:25)
though like Kyogre ground on Rayquaza (27:23 - 27:27)
are like the three some of the like by (27:25 - 27:29)
far like probably what top 10 all-time (27:27 - 27:31)
popular like rightways are probably (27:29 - 27:33)
number two behind Mewtwo (27:31 - 27:36)
yeah I would yes and at this point ever (27:33 - 27:39)
are up there as well yeah I mean like (27:36 - 27:41)
kyogre's best water Legend all time (27:39 - 27:44)
currently right and then Groudon yeah (27:41 - 27:45)
ground (27:44 - 27:48)
yeah no it's great they're they're great (27:45 - 27:50)
and I think the way they did it with (27:48 - 27:53)
having putting Deoxys in the five-star (27:50 - 27:56)
raid like the four different forms of (27:53 - 27:57)
Deoxys and five star raids and then (27:56 - 28:00)
doing the Primal raids for Groudon and (27:57 - 28:01)
Kyogre and then just completely (28:00 - 28:03)
forgetting about the Regis like they (28:01 - 28:05)
don't even exist I think that was a good (28:03 - 28:06)
call though I think we do we do we do (28:05 - 28:09)
but yeah it's just like they don't exist (28:06 - 28:10)
in Owen anymore apparently I mean they (28:09 - 28:12)
did the reggies to the lead up yeah they (28:10 - 28:14)
did a bunch of lead up they did you had (28:12 - 28:16)
to get the the code or whatever to get (28:14 - 28:18)
the limited the timed research though (28:16 - 28:20)
right (28:18 - 28:21)
um well everyone you guys got the (28:20 - 28:23)
reggies from the code right (28:21 - 28:26)
from last week yeah from YouTube yeah so (28:23 - 28:28)
you didn't need a ticket either no no (28:26 - 28:29)
but I mean they didn't just give they (28:28 - 28:31)
made you do the work well on iOS they (28:29 - 28:32)
made you do the work of like going to (28:31 - 28:34)
the website logging and putting in the (28:32 - 28:37)
three codes to get the Regis and then (28:34 - 28:39)
that was the only mention of the Regis (28:37 - 28:41)
throughout this whole week yeah that was (28:39 - 28:44)
kind of a bummer too because like in (28:41 - 28:47)
person they had the the Reggie rocks I (28:44 - 28:48)
took a picture and posted on I took a (28:47 - 28:50)
picture I think Reggie Rock and post on (28:48 - 28:51)
Instagram like they put the rocks in the (28:50 - 28:54)
desert and then behind the Reggie symbol (28:51 - 28:57)
was the code (28:54 - 29:00)
um and so like the concept was like when (28:57 - 29:02)
you're at go Fest it was or not go Fest (29:00 - 29:04)
ho and tour was like supposed to be a (29:02 - 29:06)
like a discovery and a surprise and (29:04 - 29:08)
somehow I don't know somebody on Twitter (29:06 - 29:09)
was like oh here are all three codes at (29:08 - 29:11)
like four in the morning like before the (29:09 - 29:13)
event even started and then everyone (29:11 - 29:15)
just redeemed it before the event but (29:13 - 29:17)
like like I feel like there are moments (29:15 - 29:20)
where Niantic (29:17 - 29:23)
can I detour real quick so the The (29:20 - 29:25)
Detour I want to do real quick is (29:23 - 29:27)
there's this messaging that has been (29:25 - 29:30)
going around that Niantic (29:27 - 29:33)
hates Pokemon go and they're actively (29:30 - 29:36)
trying to kill the game or like Niantic (29:33 - 29:37)
doesn't like like Pokemon go or they're (29:36 - 29:39)
always trying to screw over the fans or (29:37 - 29:41)
whatever and I just don't understand (29:39 - 29:44)
that logic it reminds me of when like (29:41 - 29:45)
the national deck stuff happened with (29:44 - 29:47)
sword and shield and people were just (29:45 - 29:50)
like mizuda hates Pokemon it's like what (29:47 - 29:54)
basis first off Masuda wasn't first off (29:50 - 29:56)
there are higher up people than Masuda (29:54 - 29:58)
like if we're gonna blame anyone we (29:56 - 29:59)
should probably play Miss shihara right (29:58 - 30:01)
like (29:59 - 30:02)
like (30:01 - 30:04)
but there's like there's there's there (30:02 - 30:06)
that was like the I felt like all week (30:04 - 30:08)
is like Niantic hates Pokemon go players (30:06 - 30:12)
Niantic hates Pokemon uh and like not (30:08 - 30:14)
like of you know Niantic makes other (30:12 - 30:16)
games right they make the NBA game now (30:14 - 30:18)
they make Pikmin they make uh Ingress (30:16 - 30:20)
still (30:18 - 30:21)
um what's the game with the weird (30:20 - 30:23)
creatures it hasn't come out yet Peridot (30:21 - 30:26)
I think yep um and again very similar (30:23 - 30:28)
messaging to back then we're like oh (30:26 - 30:29)
game freak only cares about like Little (30:28 - 30:31)
Town Hero they don't care about Pokemon (30:29 - 30:33)
it's like Niantic only cares about (30:31 - 30:35)
Peridot they don't care about Pokemon I (30:33 - 30:37)
don't I don't understand this logic what (30:35 - 30:41)
I can say in a personal uh experience is (30:37 - 30:43)
I talk to a lot of people at Niantic uh (30:41 - 30:46)
I you know I've I've met the the the (30:43 - 30:50)
woman who made the mega Ray Mega Pokemon (30:46 - 30:53)
changes Mega Evolution changes I met her (30:50 - 30:55)
in St Louis I met her again (30:53 - 30:56)
um in Seattle (30:55 - 30:59)
it was very clear to me that she was so (30:56 - 31:01)
excited to work on the mega changes make (30:59 - 31:02)
it happen she was excited that was well (31:01 - 31:04)
received she said she was working on (31:02 - 31:07)
something else very exciting (31:04 - 31:08)
um for Pokemon (31:07 - 31:11)
uh every single person I've talked to at (31:08 - 31:13)
Niantic (31:11 - 31:15)
loves this game (31:13 - 31:17)
they are they're I'm friends with a (31:15 - 31:18)
bunch of them they're sending me remote (31:17 - 31:20)
in they they're they love remote Reigns (31:18 - 31:21)
because they're sending me remote raids (31:20 - 31:23)
all the time like the remote rating (31:21 - 31:24)
they're level 50 they're flexing their (31:23 - 31:27)
shinies like there hasn't there I have (31:24 - 31:29)
probably talked to 30 different Niantic (31:27 - 31:31)
employees I can say only one of them I (31:29 - 31:32)
talk to who doesn't even work there (31:31 - 31:34)
anymore like didn't really care about (31:32 - 31:36)
Pokemon they were like yeah I'm just (31:34 - 31:39)
here because like friend referred I (31:36 - 31:40)
thought it was a good opportunity I'm (31:39 - 31:42)
not a huge Pokemon guy seems cool but (31:40 - 31:44)
like not my thing like (31:42 - 31:47)
the other 29 people I've talked to (31:44 - 31:49)
absolutely love Pokemon (31:47 - 31:51)
and when I look at like that Reggie (31:49 - 31:53)
thing of like the Reggie rocks and like (31:51 - 31:56)
this code behind it like that is very (31:53 - 31:58)
gen 3 that is very like we want to try (31:56 - 32:01)
to make something that encaptures what (31:58 - 32:03)
the Regis were in gen 3 so putting like (32:01 - 32:06)
these Reggie Rock no pun intended uh (32:03 - 32:08)
rocks in the desert with codes behind it (32:06 - 32:10)
for trainer to discover is like a really (32:08 - 32:11)
cool thing (32:10 - 32:13)
um there are so many passionate people (32:11 - 32:15)
that work at Niantic (32:13 - 32:18)
now that care about Pokemon now that's (32:15 - 32:21)
not not that's not to say that I I am (32:18 - 32:23)
sure there are higher ups at Niantic who (32:21 - 32:25)
make these decisions that are like how (32:23 - 32:27)
can we nickel and dime our players how (32:25 - 32:28)
can we get as much money from this event (32:27 - 32:31)
what are you doing to like have like I (32:28 - 32:33)
am sure those higher ups exist because (32:31 - 32:36)
they exist at every company (32:33 - 32:37)
um but all the people I've worked with (32:36 - 32:40)
and all I've talked to (32:37 - 32:43)
they love this game so I I the messaging (32:40 - 32:45)
of like Niantic hates Pokemon they're (32:43 - 32:46)
trying to kill it off they're trying to (32:45 - 32:48)
destroy their player base I don't think (32:46 - 32:50)
that's true at all uh I also like when I (32:48 - 32:52)
talk to one of the community managers I (32:50 - 32:53)
was like hey I don't know who worked on (32:52 - 32:55)
the big and small Pokemon but I love the (32:53 - 32:58)
big and small Pokemon and they were like (32:55 - 33:00)
I'll give them that feedback because (32:58 - 33:01)
they worked on it for a full year and (33:00 - 33:03)
that was like their baby and they (33:01 - 33:05)
absolutely wanted to make sure this (33:03 - 33:06)
happened in Pokemon (33:05 - 33:08)
I don't know anyone who hates a game (33:06 - 33:10)
that wants to spend a passion project on (33:08 - 33:11)
like I really want big and small Pokemon (33:10 - 33:13)
in this video game and they were able to (33:11 - 33:15)
do it and it works great and I I still (33:13 - 33:17)
like it I know not Everyone likes it but (33:15 - 33:18)
like I'm very into the big and small (33:17 - 33:20)
Pokemon oh I agree I'm very much into (33:18 - 33:22)
the biggest mall Pokemon too I got a (33:20 - 33:23)
hatched a hatched an extra extra large (33:22 - 33:25)
Happiny the other day and it was really (33:23 - 33:27)
exciting because it doesn't tell you (33:25 - 33:29)
when you hatch it or I didn't see it and (33:27 - 33:30)
then I was going through transferring (33:29 - 33:31)
stuff and it was like you're (33:30 - 33:33)
transferring a double XL Pokemon it's (33:31 - 33:35)
like what hey look I can leave out (33:33 - 33:38)
Happiny it's a giant Happiny it's great (33:35 - 33:40)
you got a giant baby Pokemon yeah it's (33:38 - 33:42)
awesome (33:40 - 33:45)
so I uh anyways (33:42 - 33:47)
I think for a free event you guys were (33:45 - 33:50)
right like it felt very mid it didn't (33:47 - 33:52)
feel like the worst event they've ever (33:50 - 33:52)
done (33:52 - 33:54)
and it didn't feel like the best nowhere (33:52 - 33:56)
near the best event they've ever done (33:54 - 33:58)
but there was also no price tag to it (33:56 - 34:02)
yeah yeah I think that (33:58 - 34:04)
I will say for as far as free events go (34:02 - 34:07)
they always the one that they always do (34:04 - 34:09)
really well is the Halloween event right (34:07 - 34:11)
people love the Halloween event it's (34:09 - 34:13)
like a week-long event but it's it you (34:11 - 34:14)
know there's not (34:13 - 34:15)
I don't think there's any there's no (34:14 - 34:16)
cost maybe there was like a limited (34:15 - 34:18)
research or something last time but you (34:16 - 34:19)
know for the last few years there's not (34:18 - 34:21)
been anything and they've done that (34:19 - 34:22)
really well (34:21 - 34:24)
um as far as like a (34:22 - 34:26)
two-day event I guess I could only think (34:24 - 34:28)
of (34:26 - 34:30)
like an Eevee Community Day or like the (34:28 - 34:31)
end of the year Community Day the (34:30 - 34:33)
December Community Day where it's two (34:31 - 34:35)
days long twinkling fantasy was probably (34:33 - 34:37)
the thing that says that to me that (34:35 - 34:40)
whole week was fantastic right that was (34:37 - 34:43)
that was earlier no that was late that (34:40 - 34:44)
was earlier this year (34:43 - 34:48)
I think it was recent it was in January (34:44 - 34:50)
I believe okay yeah (34:48 - 34:53)
um but I feel like this one (34:50 - 34:56)
was yeah it was just it was fine like I (34:53 - 34:58)
had I enjoyed playing today and I will (34:56 - 35:00)
play tomorrow as well (34:58 - 35:06)
um I do wish that with how much (35:00 - 35:09)
with how little energy you get from (35:06 - 35:11)
those Primal raids (35:09 - 35:12)
like with especially Kyogre if you're (35:11 - 35:14)
getting Kyogre and you're getting it (35:12 - 35:16)
down to the wire which happens a lot (35:14 - 35:19)
because it's not that easy to get like (35:16 - 35:21)
10 or 12 people in a raid and Kyogre is (35:19 - 35:23)
definitely tougher to uh knock out (35:21 - 35:25)
you're getting somewhere between 60 and (35:23 - 35:28)
70 Primal energy and you need 400 and if (35:25 - 35:31)
you chose the Groudon or the Ruby uh (35:28 - 35:33)
badge which I did (35:31 - 35:34)
um you know I look at the end of today (35:33 - 35:36)
and I think (35:34 - 35:39)
you get both (35:36 - 35:42)
um energy from the special research (35:39 - 35:44)
no you only get your you only get the (35:42 - 35:47)
200 from your you get candy for both (35:44 - 35:50)
yeah oh you don't get the energy for (35:47 - 35:52)
both uses yeah (35:50 - 35:54)
for Groudon (35:52 - 35:55)
um so at the end of my first day with (35:54 - 35:56)
Groudon (35:55 - 35:59)
in Kyogre I have a little over a (35:56 - 36:01)
thousand energy with Groudon and then (35:59 - 36:04)
only like almost 500 with Kyogre and I I (36:01 - 36:06)
did a similar amount of raids with both (36:04 - 36:08)
of them but it's still a bunch of rates (36:06 - 36:11)
yeah because Groudon is able to be taken (36:08 - 36:13)
down so much easier you're getting 80 90 (36:11 - 36:16)
100 energy per Groudon raid but only 60 (36:13 - 36:19)
or 70 energy per kyogreed so anyways the (36:16 - 36:21)
point is is like with with all of that (36:19 - 36:23)
it would have been kind of nice for them (36:21 - 36:25)
to maybe say you know here's five free (36:23 - 36:27)
passes like do do like people want to (36:25 - 36:29)
complain they weren't remote that's I (36:27 - 36:30)
mean like what I mean yeah people are (36:29 - 36:31)
going to complain no matter what but it (36:30 - 36:33)
was kind of interesting that it was (36:31 - 36:36)
I don't think there were any passes (36:33 - 36:37)
I know there were two premium passes (36:36 - 36:38)
that I got at some point but I don't (36:37 - 36:41)
remember which which part of what like I (36:38 - 36:43)
believe that was (36:41 - 36:45)
oh I don't I remember them giving us (36:43 - 36:47)
premium passes for Rayquaza messing up (36:45 - 36:49)
in Vegas (36:47 - 36:49)
premium passes for one of the things (36:50 - 36:53)
today for something that I completed (36:52 - 36:54)
today (36:53 - 36:55)
um (36:54 - 36:57)
oh here I have the thing here so uh (36:55 - 36:58)
maybe it was one of the collection (36:57 - 37:00)
challenges no you do get two so so the (36:58 - 37:02)
free thing that you get the special (37:00 - 37:05)
research is your step one is to power up (37:02 - 37:07)
Pokemon yes (37:05 - 37:09)
um and you get three free incenses (37:07 - 37:11)
that's what it is yeah and then you (37:09 - 37:14)
choose Gulpin sirskit Cacnea (37:11 - 37:16)
and I think everyone agrees that one of (37:14 - 37:19)
those is probably increased shiny (37:16 - 37:22)
um and then you then for the next task (37:19 - 37:24)
you have to use an incense catch five of (37:22 - 37:26)
what you picked Catch 10 different (37:24 - 37:29)
species then you get two free raid (37:26 - 37:31)
passes the premium ones okay and then (37:29 - 37:34)
step three is this is where I was (37:31 - 37:36)
confused because you do get awarded (37:34 - 37:40)
Groudon energy first but only if you (37:36 - 37:43)
have the Ruby badge but you do still get (37:40 - 37:47)
10 Groudon candy for both and then you (37:43 - 37:48)
get the puzzle Soul Rock trap pitch Full (37:47 - 37:51)
Beat and then step four if you pick team (37:48 - 37:54)
Sapphire then you get the 200 Sapphire (37:51 - 37:57)
energy you get mine in Lunatone Wham or (37:54 - 37:59)
illumise and then everyone gets the 10 (37:57 - 38:02)
Kyogre candy and then (37:59 - 38:04)
um you have to activate Prime over (38:02 - 38:06)
version which gives you two (38:04 - 38:08)
TMS that's kind of a bad reward and then (38:06 - 38:11)
the final reward is Spinda (38:08 - 38:12)
um which is kind of a bummer for you (38:11 - 38:14)
guys that you only got one spin to (38:12 - 38:15)
encounter in (38:14 - 38:17)
Vegas there was like eight Spinda (38:15 - 38:19)
encounters which was pretty cool the way (38:17 - 38:21)
they did spin in Vegas was awesome (38:19 - 38:23)
um if you don't if you don't know they (38:21 - 38:24)
they took eight stops out of the whole (38:23 - 38:27)
park and they were spin to stops so when (38:24 - 38:30)
you spun them uh then you could redeem (38:27 - 38:32)
Spinda and so you had eight chances for (38:30 - 38:33)
shiny Spinda or just eight Spinda (38:32 - 38:35)
encounters and that would work both days (38:33 - 38:37)
so 16 total (38:35 - 38:39)
was it different for was each one of the (38:37 - 38:42)
stops I think there was two forms there (38:39 - 38:45)
was just the the spots on the cheeks and (38:42 - 38:47)
then there was goatee one (38:45 - 38:48)
okay I don't know what I don't know what (38:47 - 38:51)
numbers I wish that's how they listed (38:48 - 38:54)
them in the game the spots on the cheeks (38:51 - 38:58)
uh so okay so with those steps that you (38:54 - 39:00)
were talking about right so you have (38:58 - 39:03)
um you get 200 energy for let's say (39:00 - 39:05)
Groudon uh and they give you two premium (39:03 - 39:06)
raid passes (39:05 - 39:09)
so if you were to get to do really well (39:06 - 39:12)
on Groudon with those two passes that (39:09 - 39:14)
would give you a hundred each so you get (39:12 - 39:16)
400 you'd have 200 from that you get 200 (39:14 - 39:18)
from the research so now you have 400 so (39:16 - 39:20)
you can do the prime over version so (39:18 - 39:21)
you're not spending any money at that (39:20 - 39:22)
point right if and that's in the best (39:21 - 39:24)
case scenario you do two of them you do (39:22 - 39:25)
the best time and then you know there it (39:24 - 39:26)
is (39:25 - 39:28)
then you don't nothing happens with (39:26 - 39:29)
Kyogre at that point right you've only (39:28 - 39:30)
this is only Groudon that you've now (39:29 - 39:33)
done so it just seems like for all the (39:30 - 39:35)
marketing that they did leading up to (39:33 - 39:36)
this with like the Primal like all the (39:35 - 39:38)
every time you go to the Pokemon go live (39:36 - 39:40)
website it's just you just see Primal (39:38 - 39:43)
Kyogre and Groudon on the front page and (39:40 - 39:45)
everything and then you get to the event (39:43 - 39:48)
and it's like oh they're there but uh (39:45 - 39:50)
you gotta you gotta work for it honey (39:48 - 39:52)
you got to really work for it for them I (39:50 - 39:54)
mean they are strong Pokemon like Steve (39:52 - 39:56)
said earlier they are some of the (39:54 - 39:57)
strongest Pokemon in the game they are (39:56 - 39:59)
legendaries that are they're Primal (39:57 - 40:01)
they're not Mega effectively they're (39:59 - 40:03)
megas they're like super megas yeah so I (40:01 - 40:07)
understand it but it also does cost if (40:03 - 40:10)
you don't have an in-person Group which (40:07 - 40:13)
is unfortunate if you I kind of get it (40:10 - 40:15)
if you power up a Pokemon 15 times (40:13 - 40:17)
you're getting two free ride passes (40:15 - 40:19)
you're getting your free daily (40:17 - 40:23)
so that's true daily three raids passes (40:19 - 40:26)
even if you're doing 60s uh you would (40:23 - 40:28)
have to do 70 70. (40:26 - 40:32)
60 is the lowest 90s the lowest I think (40:28 - 40:33)
100 is the highest because I've gotten (40:32 - 40:36)
100 I got 100 crowd on energy in a (40:33 - 40:38)
couple different raids okay but so (40:36 - 40:41)
ideally you're doing (40:38 - 40:45)
three to four raids (40:41 - 40:47)
plus your 200 energy to get one (40:45 - 40:51)
ultimately free Primal yeah (40:47 - 40:54)
um and I wonder if like Niantic is like (40:51 - 40:56)
again probably somebody higher up was (40:54 - 40:58)
like how like I I know what the (40:56 - 40:59)
conversation is probably like how do we (40:58 - 41:01)
get more people to play this event from (40:59 - 41:03)
last event right like that's like you (41:01 - 41:05)
don't have to work at Niantic to know (41:03 - 41:06)
that that's like the standard like (41:05 - 41:08)
business conversation I'll get more (41:06 - 41:10)
people to play our video game right so I (41:08 - 41:12)
wonder if the logic's like well instead (41:10 - 41:14)
of like a five dollar ticket (41:12 - 41:17)
what if we make it free and then (41:14 - 41:18)
naturally (41:17 - 41:21)
more players would be incentivized to (41:18 - 41:24)
buy raid passes or incubators because (41:21 - 41:27)
they're out here for free with their (41:24 - 41:30)
friends versus well I don't want to (41:27 - 41:31)
spend the five dollars because I don't (41:30 - 41:32)
know what I'm gonna get (41:31 - 41:34)
so I'm not gonna come out with my (41:32 - 41:36)
friends I'm sure they have that data (41:34 - 41:38)
like oh I'm sure I'm sure they know like (41:36 - 41:41)
if we right like they've captured all of (41:38 - 41:43)
that data to know uh they know there's (41:41 - 41:45)
people like I'm assuming you did this (41:43 - 41:46)
too Steve like you've probably bought (41:45 - 41:50)
incubators and raid passes so I did that (41:46 - 41:51)
for sure right so they know there's (41:50 - 41:53)
people that'll do those still I got two (41:51 - 41:56)
10K eggs today by the way two really and (41:53 - 41:57)
then it was raining so I wasn't walking (41:56 - 41:59)
around a whole lot so they're still (41:57 - 42:01)
incubating every single stop I spun when (41:59 - 42:03)
I had an egg slot every single one was a (42:01 - 42:04)
10K egg (42:03 - 42:08)
yeah I I got incredibly lucky all day I (42:04 - 42:10)
played six hours and I was at MOA so I (42:08 - 42:12)
was hatching eggs non-stop I maybe got (42:10 - 42:16)
like three 2ks like five five k's and (42:12 - 42:19)
like 20 to 30 10ks like it was okay (42:16 - 42:23)
honestly today today today (42:19 - 42:23)
I still have the the reason I have some (42:24 - 42:28)
so fast is because I have the makeup egg (42:26 - 42:30)
bonus okay I was wondering if you had (42:28 - 42:32)
that you have a you have it weighted so (42:30 - 42:34)
that you're supposed to get more 10K (42:32 - 42:37)
eggs yeah yeah that's why when Hannah (42:34 - 42:39)
said that she got a bunch of 10K eggs I (42:37 - 42:41)
was not in Vegas like everyone else near (42:39 - 42:43)
me was also getting 10K eggs pretty (42:41 - 42:46)
regularly really I got I I had an empty (42:43 - 42:50)
bag or empty eggs egg spaces uh so nine (42:46 - 42:51)
spots and then I went and spun nine (42:50 - 42:56)
stops and I got uh three 2ks like I (42:51 - 42:58)
don't know I ended up only four times (42:56 - 43:00)
only two you waited after ten right yeah (42:58 - 43:02)
it was in the middle of the day it was (43:00 - 43:04)
like this afternoon and only two of them (43:02 - 43:06)
were 10K eggs and the rest of them were (43:04 - 43:09)
two and 5K eggs so that's really unlucky (43:06 - 43:12)
it's really unlucky and it's a bummer (43:09 - 43:13)
that to spend all the money on (43:12 - 43:14)
incubators because obviously I had to (43:13 - 43:16)
incubate and hatch all the eggs that I (43:14 - 43:19)
already had in my bag and then I was (43:16 - 43:22)
thinking oh I'll get some 10K eggs (43:19 - 43:24)
and on honestly like it's part of it's (43:22 - 43:25)
on me right it was raining today so I (43:24 - 43:26)
wasn't out walking around as much so (43:25 - 43:28)
like I that's why they're not hatched (43:26 - 43:30)
yet but still it was yeah you can play (43:28 - 43:31)
Niantic though you can blame Niantic for (43:30 - 43:32)
the rain that's fine (43:31 - 43:36)
yeah must have been them but uh it was (43:32 - 43:37)
just uh that was a little bit of a (43:36 - 43:40)
bummer to see like Oh I thought it would (43:37 - 43:42)
be more like not guaranteed 10K eggs (43:40 - 43:45)
because it's already guaranteed that (43:42 - 43:46)
it's gonna be those 10ks are gonna be (43:45 - 43:49)
one of the three regionals and you know (43:46 - 43:50)
maybe they're shining maybe not whatever (43:49 - 43:52)
but (43:50 - 43:53)
um I thought there would have been a (43:52 - 43:54)
little bit more of a higher drop rate (43:53 - 43:56)
and again I only did nine right I only (43:54 - 43:59)
did nine spins for eggs so (43:56 - 44:01)
could have just gotten unlucky (43:59 - 44:02)
um but I feel like I was seeing people (44:01 - 44:05)
in slack today and they were a little (44:02 - 44:07)
bit disappointed at the lack of 10K eggs (44:05 - 44:08)
that they were getting (44:07 - 44:10)
yeah I mean unless you're like hardcore (44:08 - 44:12)
going for shinies (44:10 - 44:14)
there's nothing exciting about hatching (44:12 - 44:16)
five relicans in a row (44:14 - 44:19)
if you don't have a relican I mean there (44:16 - 44:20)
are a lot of people the first one is (44:19 - 44:23)
very exciting but when you when you have (44:20 - 44:24)
five 10K eggs and you're like oh man (44:23 - 44:26)
what am I getting I was like oh well (44:24 - 44:27)
they're all really can't though okay (44:26 - 44:28)
then you can trade them to people I (44:27 - 44:31)
still have I still have 40 relicanth (44:28 - 44:34)
from Worlds 2019 that I I'm kind of glad (44:31 - 44:35)
they're rare this event because I think (44:34 - 44:37)
I can still trade him to people yeah I (44:35 - 44:39)
think that's the other thing too right (44:37 - 44:41)
like so again people people were like (44:39 - 44:43)
well they put regionals in raids last (44:41 - 44:45)
time and I understand like I just want (44:43 - 44:48)
to spend the dollar to get the relicanth (44:45 - 44:51)
in the raid and then that's the last one (44:48 - 44:53)
I need (44:51 - 44:55)
um but then the on the flip side like I (44:53 - 44:56)
said earlier then all of a sudden it's (44:55 - 44:58)
like man I wish there was more groudons (44:56 - 44:59)
it's like well you have three raids in (44:58 - 45:00)
your city they all ended up being (44:59 - 45:03)
relicanth like what what do you like you (45:00 - 45:05)
can't have it there's just so much raid (45:03 - 45:07)
stuff happening (45:05 - 45:08)
um but the other thing is like if (45:07 - 45:10)
somebody's hatching a relicance just (45:08 - 45:11)
trade them for it but then again that (45:10 - 45:13)
would require you to be social and have (45:11 - 45:15)
friends and like that's what Niantic (45:13 - 45:17)
wants right like it's it's such like (45:15 - 45:19)
this this pull this push and pull of (45:17 - 45:21)
like people being like well my local (45:19 - 45:24)
community is dead so we only remote (45:21 - 45:27)
right pass and it's like well how how do (45:24 - 45:29)
you expect the local community to get (45:27 - 45:30)
better if you're all just sitting at (45:29 - 45:32)
home remote right passing like (45:30 - 45:36)
like uh like niantic's doing things and (45:32 - 45:38)
I'm I'm for the record I don't think (45:36 - 45:40)
they're doing things perfectly I think (45:38 - 45:41)
they could do a lot more things to get (45:40 - 45:43)
people outside (45:41 - 45:43)
um (45:43 - 45:46)
but like (45:43 - 45:49)
there are options you can you trading is (45:46 - 45:51)
still a thing like (45:49 - 45:54)
yeah it is but it goes back to and I (45:51 - 45:55)
don't know maybe this doesn't really (45:54 - 45:57)
fall under that as as heavily but it (45:55 - 45:59)
goes back to if you want to get people (45:57 - 46:00)
outside (45:59 - 46:03)
make going outside better but don't take (46:00 - 46:05)
away what you then what you already gave (46:03 - 46:07)
over the last couple of years and (46:05 - 46:09)
they've done that in a couple ways (46:07 - 46:11)
um but mostly it's like don't take that (46:09 - 46:13)
stuff back because clearly it's worked (46:11 - 46:16)
in a way that maybe nobody thought it (46:13 - 46:18)
was going to work like I will say maybe (46:16 - 46:21)
the local community you have is dead but (46:18 - 46:23)
there's now a global community that that (46:21 - 46:27)
didn't uh that didn't exist before right (46:23 - 46:29)
that now it's like oh like well I can (46:27 - 46:32)
raid with people in Germany and you know (46:29 - 46:34)
I can read with people in Australia (46:32 - 46:37)
whatever and that's fun especially if (46:34 - 46:39)
you you know in an online world if you (46:37 - 46:40)
are friends with people that are in (46:39 - 46:42)
other countries it's fun to be able to (46:40 - 46:43)
be invited to those raids and then you (46:42 - 46:44)
know you're rating with that friend that (46:43 - 46:47)
you have in another country so if you (46:44 - 46:48)
want us to also go outside and do those (46:47 - 46:51)
things which I fully agree with I do (46:48 - 46:53)
love going out and playing walking (46:51 - 46:54)
around and playing Pokemon go outside (46:53 - 46:57)
but don't take away the things you gave (46:54 - 46:59)
us because you kind of created a new (46:57 - 47:00)
community for people to have don't take (46:59 - 47:02)
that stuff away just make the rewards of (47:00 - 47:04)
going outside (47:02 - 47:08)
better I think the raids this weekend (47:04 - 47:13)
were guaranteed ONE XL rare candy (47:08 - 47:16)
um one extra XL right I don't think (47:13 - 47:19)
that's good I guess for some people but (47:16 - 47:21)
like though I think that's good for the (47:19 - 47:23)
hardcore people that will be looking for (47:21 - 47:24)
that anyways I don't think that's good (47:23 - 47:26)
enough for you know (47:24 - 47:28)
somebody who only plays Community Days (47:26 - 47:30)
right like those people exist they're (47:28 - 47:33)
like and and that's a fair way to play (47:30 - 47:35)
this game the people who like hey I play (47:33 - 47:37)
Pokemon go once a week I'll play all (47:35 - 47:39)
three hours on community day but you (47:37 - 47:40)
know I'm not you know they're not going (47:39 - 47:41)
out every Tuesday night every Wednesday (47:40 - 47:44)
night they're not like going for shundos (47:41 - 47:46)
or whatever right like (47:44 - 47:49)
I I don't think one guaranteed Excel (47:46 - 47:53)
rare candy that's the word XL rare candy (47:49 - 47:55)
is like good enough to get people to go (47:53 - 47:58)
outside I don't know what is like no I (47:55 - 47:59)
mean I don't either and I'm not a (47:58 - 48:01)
Niantic employee I'm not the one that's (47:59 - 48:04)
gonna be making those decisions but they (48:01 - 48:06)
absolutely (48:04 - 48:09)
could make just make rewards for doing (48:06 - 48:10)
things in person that don't take away (48:09 - 48:12)
from people who aren't but do (48:10 - 48:15)
incentivize people to go out and do (48:12 - 48:17)
things in person again exactly they need (48:15 - 48:19)
to incentivize the behavior they want (48:17 - 48:21)
instead of trying to make things more (48:19 - 48:22)
expensive than they already are because (48:21 - 48:25)
that's just gonna make people angry (48:22 - 48:27)
yeah yeah (48:25 - 48:27)
um okay well to wrap up I think the (48:28 - 48:32)
event's fine uh (48:30 - 48:35)
uh I I will have to do another episode (48:32 - 48:36)
about the Vegas stuff because there was (48:35 - 48:38)
a lot happening there (48:36 - 48:40)
um both good and bad there are a lot of (48:38 - 48:41)
things that Niantic did right at that (48:40 - 48:43)
event and of course uh I think a lot of (48:41 - 48:44)
people heard about the things that went (48:43 - 48:46)
wrong at that event but there was a lot (48:44 - 48:47)
of things that went right at that event (48:46 - 48:48)
so (48:47 - 48:49)
um and the reason I do still think it's (48:48 - 48:51)
important to talk about that is because (48:49 - 48:54)
it was the first event of the year (48:51 - 48:57)
um and now that you know (48:54 - 49:00)
the Niantic loves in-person events so I (48:57 - 49:03)
I suspect there will be more to come (49:00 - 49:06)
this year and the following year (49:03 - 49:08)
um and I would wager to bet they're (49:06 - 49:09)
probably gonna do a sinner tour at the (49:08 - 49:11)
same time next year because the Johto (49:09 - 49:13)
Kanto and Holland tours have all lined (49:11 - 49:16)
up around this weekend pretty much every (49:13 - 49:18)
single year it's always like the weekend (49:16 - 49:20)
before Pokemon day I think yeah I was (49:18 - 49:22)
too I was doing uh I was checking how (49:20 - 49:23)
many shinies I got last year for the (49:22 - 49:26)
Johto tour right you know in Pokemon in (49:23 - 49:28)
the storage you can still you can do you (49:26 - 49:31)
can search for age so the word age and (49:28 - 49:33)
then a number right so age zero will (49:31 - 49:35)
show you everything you caught today age (49:33 - 49:37)
one everything you caught yesterday age (49:35 - 49:39)
365 would show you everything you caught (49:37 - 49:43)
365 days ago uh and it was right around (49:39 - 49:46)
there it was like 364 363 was for the (49:43 - 49:47)
Joe the stuff I caught in the Johto tour (49:46 - 49:48)
so I was like it's like right around (49:47 - 49:51)
exactly a year did you just go day by (49:48 - 49:53)
day and try to no I did 365 and then I (49:51 - 49:56)
did 364 and 363 and it hit at one point (49:53 - 49:58)
I wasn't gonna (49:56 - 49:58)
let's just (50:02 - 50:07)
try it (50:05 - 50:09)
yeah I uh yeah I would suspect the (50:07 - 50:12)
senator this exactly in a year from now (50:09 - 50:15)
like before slightly before or slightly (50:12 - 50:16)
after Pokemon it makes sense too because (50:15 - 50:18)
it's near Pokemon day so (50:16 - 50:20)
um it makes sense for them to do that (50:18 - 50:22)
but I would again I would wager to bet (50:20 - 50:24)
that they want to continue doing (50:22 - 50:26)
in-person stuff and (50:24 - 50:29)
I wonder if this is like the future of (50:26 - 50:32)
this game for now is if you want the (50:29 - 50:34)
good stuff here's the in-person thing (50:32 - 50:36)
and if for everyone else it's free (50:34 - 50:38)
that's that's exactly what it seems like (50:36 - 50:41)
it seems like the in-person thing was (50:38 - 50:43)
there was you know they didn't have that (50:41 - 50:44)
last year there before so charge (50:43 - 50:46)
everybody and then now you get a little (50:44 - 50:51)
bit more stuff and now it's back to (50:46 - 50:51)
yeah uh so you know you can either go to (50:52 - 50:57)
that in-person event and get the cool (50:55 - 50:58)
stuff or and I wonder if that's going to (50:57 - 51:00)
be how go Fest works this year oh I (50:58 - 51:02)
think so too I think so we're gonna see (51:00 - 51:05)
something similar where maybe and I mean (51:02 - 51:06)
we don't know anything yet but like (51:05 - 51:08)
maybe it's not increased shiny if for (51:06 - 51:10)
the global one again or you know (51:08 - 51:12)
something like that because you could go (51:10 - 51:14)
to those in-person events where that was (51:12 - 51:16)
you know initially supposed to be where (51:14 - 51:18)
you're getting those increased shiny (51:16 - 51:20)
rights and Regional Pokemon right not so (51:18 - 51:22)
much the global stuff it almost reminds (51:20 - 51:25)
me of like those big like EDM shows (51:22 - 51:27)
where it's like you can spend the 300 to (51:25 - 51:28)
go to the EDM show or you could spend (51:27 - 51:30)
like the fifty dollars to get like the (51:28 - 51:32)
virtual version (51:30 - 51:33)
um and like watch it through your (51:32 - 51:36)
computer because like you can't be there (51:33 - 51:37)
um it kind of reminds me of that except (51:36 - 51:40)
niantic's like come to Vegas uh or (51:37 - 51:42)
here's the free version next weekend you (51:40 - 51:46)
can't complain because it's free uh (51:42 - 51:47)
we're not charging you well I mean (51:46 - 51:49)
they're charging you of like trying to (51:47 - 51:51)
sucker you into (51:49 - 51:54)
um the the Mega Energy or the Primal (51:51 - 51:56)
energy they absolutely did but and I'll (51:54 - 51:58)
do it again tomorrow (51:56 - 52:00)
I'm saying this now and I know the (51:58 - 52:02)
perfect guy at the show and I'll do it (52:00 - 52:04)
again but (52:02 - 52:06)
um again like you said this event (52:04 - 52:09)
it was fine like again it was fun to go (52:06 - 52:11)
out run walk around catch some Pokemon (52:09 - 52:13)
like hoe in Pokemon (52:11 - 52:15)
um obviously it would have been nice if (52:13 - 52:17)
there was an increased shiny chance of (52:15 - 52:20)
some kind but again I think there was (52:17 - 52:22)
for certain Pokemon I really think the (52:20 - 52:24)
cersky Cacnea and Gulpin whichever path (52:22 - 52:26)
you picked I think I don't even mean (52:24 - 52:28)
just the ones right afterwards I mean I (52:26 - 52:30)
think surskit and like whatever if I (52:28 - 52:32)
pick surskit I think they were there was (52:30 - 52:33)
a boosted rate for the rest of the day (52:32 - 52:35)
yes I think there was that and I think (52:33 - 52:36)
there might have been a boosted rate of (52:35 - 52:39)
shinies for Pikachus and unknown maybe (52:36 - 52:41)
on inside usually unknown's not boosted (52:39 - 52:46)
okay maybe just Pikachus I don't know (52:41 - 52:46)
definitely it had to be (52:50 - 52:55)
all right well we'll be back on Tuesday (52:53 - 52:58)
morning with our thoughts on Pokemon day (52:55 - 53:03)
