your host this week william r anderson (0:57 - 1:02)

teeth after you you (1:09 - 1:12)

question of the week i will bequeath (3:12 - 3:17)
this honor to you (3:14 - 3:19)
i mean maybe i'll like practice for it (3:17 - 3:22)
but my voice is also like a musical (3:19 - 3:25)
choral voice a lot like yours so it's (3:22 - 3:27)
strange in musical theater and choir (3:25 - 3:29)
yeah actually doing other genres are not (3:27 - 3:31)
easy (3:29 - 3:33)

we have not covered (4:02 - 4:06)
my biggest offense (4:03 - 4:08)
in weeks and weeks and weeks and the (4:06 - 4:10)
daily incense i don't think the thing's (4:08 - 4:12)

first of all my main grievance was that (4:24 - 4:27)
you guys hadn't covered it yet but (4:26 - 4:28)
second (4:27 - 4:31)
i didn't get a shiny worm bowl (4:28 - 4:33)

trade it to you (4:47 - 4:51)
yes i don't have anything for you i (4:49 - 4:54)
saved you i have a lot of you don't have (4:51 - 4:56)
to save anything for me (4:54 - 4:59)

that was it and it died i did get a (5:45 - 5:49)
really good charger bug though um mostly (5:47 - 5:50)
it was (5:49 - 5:53)

violet because right right now it is (6:59 - 7:03)
still a 0 out of 10 game (7:01 - 7:05)
wow (7:03 - 7:07)
and cody if it does make you feel any (7:05 - 7:09)
better even the slightest bit of warmth (7:07 - 7:11)
for your heart (7:09 - 7:13)
on friday night when greg and i were (7:11 - 7:16)
playing magic the gathering i played an (7:13 - 7:18)
insect tribal deck (7:16 - 7:20)
it is true was (7:18 - 7:22)
a certain amount of lands which no (7:20 - 7:24)
matter how many times people ask me i (7:22 - 7:27)
will not reveal it's 20. and (7:24 - 7:29)
everything else was an insect that's (7:27 - 7:31)
awesome (7:29 - 7:33)
well insect in magic terms which is kind (7:31 - 7:35)
of the same as insect and pokemon terms (7:33 - 7:37)
they're not all insects right yeah (7:35 - 7:41)
here's the thing i knew something was up (7:37 - 7:45)
the first game and i'm like (7:41 - 7:47)
nah something something's not right (7:45 - 7:49)
and then the second game when the same (7:47 - 7:50)
thing happened i was like something was (7:49 - 7:53)
really not right something something (7:50 - 7:56)
shenanigans is happening over here (7:53 - 7:58)
that's okay i played very close to my (7:56 - 8:00)
heart the second game and i wrecked you (7:58 - 8:02)
all the heart of the cards that's a (8:00 - 8:04)
different game (8:02 - 8:06)
my grievance (8:04 - 8:09)
daily incense yes not that i (8:06 - 8:10)
particularly (8:09 - 8:13)
it's it's actually not the daily incense (8:10 - 8:15)
itself that is a problem it is the (8:13 - 8:18)
special research that came with the (8:15 - 8:20)
daily incense when it launched (8:18 - 8:22)
because (8:20 - 8:24)
much as the famous and often (8:22 - 8:26)
misappropriated quote because nobody (8:24 - 8:28)
really knows who said it first about (8:26 - 8:31)
golf is golf is a nice walk that's (8:28 - 8:33)
ruined (8:31 - 8:36)
pokemon go can be a nice walk that's (8:33 - 8:38)
ruined (8:36 - 8:39)
because (8:38 - 8:41)
with the special research that comes (8:39 - 8:44)
with the daily incense if you are using (8:41 - 8:46)
your pokeball plus or your whatever the (8:44 - 8:48)
other thing is called (8:46 - 8:50)
it doesn't they don't count as catches (8:48 - 8:53)
for the special you have to (8:50 - 8:56)
use your finger on the screen (8:53 - 8:59)
to catch the daily incense pokemon for (8:56 - 9:01)
them to count towards that research (8:59 - 9:04)
now if i'm out taking my daily two-mile (9:01 - 9:06)
walk my little constitutional whatever (9:04 - 9:09)
you want to call it i want to be i walk (9:06 - 9:10)
through the beautiful (9:09 - 9:13)
lakes forest parks (9:10 - 9:14)
of minnesota (9:13 - 9:16)
i want to be looking at the flora and (9:14 - 9:18)
fauna all the the changes that the (9:16 - 9:20)
cattails go through (9:18 - 9:22)
as fall approaches i don't want to be (9:20 - 9:24)
staring at a phone screen (9:22 - 9:26)
[Music] (9:24 - 9:27)
so (9:26 - 9:29)
i was for 15 minutes of your two-hour (9:27 - 9:31)
walk for 15 minutes it's not a two-hour (9:29 - 9:32)
walk it's a two-mile walk it's a (9:31 - 9:34)
40-minute walk so that's (9:32 - 9:37)
clearly a third of the walk is it that (9:34 - 9:39)
like your pokemon go plus or whatever it (9:37 - 9:41)
is that you use doesn't (9:39 - 9:43)
hit the the (9:41 - 9:47)
adventure pokemon and it's like (9:43 - 9:48)
it it (9:47 - 9:50)
it catches i mean it selects all of them (9:48 - 9:52)
they just don't count towards the (9:50 - 9:53)
research (9:52 - 9:55)
that's fine it's it's over i've i've (9:53 - 9:58)
completed all the research re i've (9:55 - 10:00)
satisfied your needs please give me my (9:58 - 10:01)
professor back (10:00 - 10:02)
he (10:01 - 10:05)
is in the stomach of guzzlord (10:02 - 10:07)
you know i said to steve that i'm going (10:05 - 10:09)
on my daily constitutional and you know (10:07 - 10:11)
what he said (10:09 - 10:13)
probably something about the bathroom (10:11 - 10:15)
yeah no he literally said i have no idea (10:13 - 10:17)
what that is yeah yeah no surprises (10:15 - 10:19)
there (10:17 - 10:21)
[Laughter] (10:19 - 10:23)
that's fine (10:21 - 10:25)
i mean if we had to do a weekly segment (10:23 - 10:28)
of words steve doesn't know (10:25 - 10:28)
probably have more than it'll be the new (10:29 - 10:34)
squarespace website we build (10:30 - 10:34)
all right (10:35 - 10:38)
so as (10:36 - 10:39)
usual (10:38 - 10:43)
uh during worlds during the finale of (10:39 - 10:45)
pokemon worlds which the world (10:43 - 10:47)
championships are taking place in london (10:45 - 10:49)
as we record i (10:47 - 10:51)
i'm not sure if they're over yet they're (10:49 - 10:52)
probably not over (10:51 - 10:54)
uh they usually go into the evening a (10:52 - 10:56)
bit (10:54 - 10:59)
uh they had released a new trailer video (10:56 - 11:01)
uh for scarlet and violet it is (10:59 - 11:05)
specifically called the new competitive (11:01 - 11:08)
trailer so it is designed to focus on (11:05 - 11:10)
what competitive means (11:08 - 11:13)
will mean in scarlet and violet (11:10 - 11:15)
so we will go over (11:13 - 11:18)
uh which what's a little strange (11:15 - 11:20)
but also not strange because this was (11:18 - 11:21)
like (11:20 - 11:23)
this is special for worlds this is the (11:21 - 11:25)
video we made for worlds so (11:23 - 11:27)
they don't have a press release to go (11:25 - 11:30)
with it right where normally when they (11:27 - 11:32)
do a trailer there it would be a press (11:30 - 11:34)
release that we could look up and review (11:32 - 11:37)
there's no press release that's not it (11:34 - 11:40)
so the first thing um they have revealed (11:37 - 11:42)
[Music] (11:40 - 11:45)
william hold back on your commentary and (11:42 - 11:48)
just say the facts that's how news works (11:45 - 11:52)
a new pokemon called cyclazar (11:48 - 11:54)
cyclizar (11:52 - 11:57)
it's a cycle lizard it's a (11:54 - 12:00)
lizard does everything in this region (11:57 - 12:02)
and william (12:00 - 12:03)
look (12:02 - 12:05)
it's too young to use its wheels which (12:03 - 12:07)
is why it's using its legs does (12:05 - 12:09)
everything in this region have to be a (12:07 - 12:11)
motorcycle yes (12:09 - 12:13)
everything has to be some form of (12:11 - 12:17)
motorcycle is it a motorcycle or is it a (12:13 - 12:20)
bicycle like a for a cyclist uh i don't (12:17 - 12:22)
care it's got a wheel for a chest but (12:20 - 12:26)
it's like the legendaries too i'm like (12:22 - 12:29)
uh what is this meet cyclazar the mount (12:26 - 12:32)
pokemon not mountain mount as in like (12:29 - 12:34)
you mount a horse (12:32 - 12:36)
um this pokemon has lived in many (12:34 - 12:40)
paladian households since ancient times (12:36 - 12:41)
it can sprint (12:40 - 12:44)
at over 70 miles per hour while carrying (12:41 - 12:48)
a human rider (12:44 - 12:48)
uh the type is dragon normal (12:48 - 12:53)
bonus points what's the other dragon (12:51 - 12:55)
normal pokemon out there (12:53 - 12:56)
uh (12:55 - 12:58)
the grandpa (12:56 - 12:59)
grandpa (12:58 - 13:00)
[Music] (12:59 - 13:02)
not the grandpa (13:00 - 13:03)
the grandpa i mean that's how you (13:02 - 13:05)
remember it yeah it's trapped with the (13:03 - 13:07)
grandpa and (13:05 - 13:08)
it (13:07 - 13:11)
knows a move we don't know if this is (13:08 - 13:14)
going to be exclusive to cyclazar but uh (13:11 - 13:18)
it is a move called shed tail (13:14 - 13:19)
which (13:18 - 13:22)
uh does two things so you can create a (13:19 - 13:24)
substitute and then it swaps places with (13:22 - 13:26)
a different (13:24 - 13:27)
pokemon in your it's like a weird (13:26 - 13:30)
version of volt switch (13:27 - 13:33)
where you do the substitute and then (13:30 - 13:37)
it pulls out the throw somebody (13:33 - 13:39)
volt switch does damage and then right (13:37 - 13:41)
this doesn't do damage well this does do (13:39 - 13:42)
damage to yourself because it's making a (13:41 - 13:44)
substitute yeah (13:42 - 13:46)
i just love it because it's like (13:44 - 13:48)
biologically accurate (13:46 - 13:50)
like lizards do this (13:48 - 13:52)
if they are threatened oh yeah yeah drop (13:50 - 13:54)
their tail yeah they'll release their (13:52 - 13:56)
tail and their tail will keep like (13:54 - 13:58)
freaking out and they'll run away (13:56 - 14:00)
because whatever is attacking them is (13:58 - 14:02)
like what is this and they'll eat the (14:00 - 14:06)
tail so that's i mean we only know that (14:02 - 14:07)
cyclozara can do this right now but they (14:06 - 14:10)
could retcon this to any (14:07 - 14:13)
blizzard salamander there is only one (14:10 - 14:15)
other pokemon that's going to get this (14:13 - 14:17)
move catcleon (14:15 - 14:20)
slowpoke oh true (14:17 - 14:22)
well so slowpoke could get it um what's (14:20 - 14:24)
that (14:22 - 14:27)
everybody else (14:24 - 14:27)
everybody eats slowpoke's tail this (14:27 - 14:31)
explains how the tail will pop off now (14:28 - 14:34)
finally so easily comes off yeah (14:31 - 14:35)
um yeah (14:34 - 14:37)
in hawaii because that's something that (14:35 - 14:39)
we do for fun with the geckos absolutely (14:37 - 14:40)
oh yeah (14:39 - 14:43)
this is the pre-evo of the legendaries (14:40 - 14:45)
right like we can sort of feel like this (14:43 - 14:46)
is the thing you get at the beginning (14:45 - 14:48)
and then you one of the quest lines now (14:46 - 14:50)
story lines is make this into the (14:48 - 14:53)
legendary pokemon you know (14:50 - 14:55)
which is so interesting to me because (14:53 - 14:58)
that's not a thing right that's been a (14:55 - 14:59)
thing before i know it was a thing in (14:58 - 15:01)
sun and moon sun and moon (14:59 - 15:04)
the little uh nebby (15:01 - 15:05)
but (15:04 - 15:06)
yeah i'm not sure because when they show (15:05 - 15:09)
you riding around the region (15:06 - 15:13)
those were the legendary pokemon already (15:09 - 15:14)
so it's like do you have to evolve it (15:13 - 15:16)
once before you can (15:14 - 15:20)
go anywhere or (15:16 - 15:20)
i mean (15:21 - 15:24)
yeah this just raises a lot of questions (15:22 - 15:26)
although then that would that would (15:24 - 15:28)
raise some hope with me that not every (15:26 - 15:32)
pokemon in paldia is a motorcycle yeah (15:28 - 15:32)
so (15:32 - 15:34)
i mean go go go goat is going to get (15:32 - 15:37)
wheels because gogoat is in (15:34 - 15:39)
the game (15:37 - 15:41)
have we (15:39 - 15:41)
so that's something i wrote down like (15:42 - 15:45)
we've seen skittle and so like i had (15:43 - 15:46)
mentioned the last time i was on the (15:45 - 15:48)
podcast like i had mentioned that there (15:46 - 15:51)
was probably going to be a (15:48 - 15:53)
pal day in version of like evolution of (15:51 - 15:55)
skitto or gogoat or something like that (15:53 - 15:56)
because (15:55 - 15:58)
of the fact that there's this um (15:56 - 16:01)
siberian ibex not siberian iberian ibex (15:58 - 16:03)
i don't know it's like a it's a goat (16:01 - 16:05)
that is native to this region the (16:03 - 16:07)
iberian peninsula not the siberian (16:05 - 16:09)
wastelands that's where we get that's (16:07 - 16:14)
where we get tires from is that animal (16:09 - 16:16)
tires known fact yeah that was how we (16:14 - 16:19)
first discovered wheels was from (16:16 - 16:21)
it's it looked i think (16:19 - 16:24)
these children are so impressionable (16:21 - 16:27)
look if that story gets up becomes part (16:24 - 16:29)
of our consciousness that this show has (16:27 - 16:32)
finally done its job we've peaked we've (16:29 - 16:33)
peaked and we can just coast on our (16:32 - 16:36)
laurels from that moment on i am (16:33 - 16:41)
super disappointed i mean i understand (16:36 - 16:43)
in some ways and i refuse to understand (16:41 - 16:45)
in other ways (16:43 - 16:47)
why (16:45 - 16:47)
why does it have to look like the (16:47 - 16:51)
substitute doll (16:49 - 16:55)
why couldn't it have looked like (16:51 - 16:57)
a tail (16:55 - 17:00)
i will say so (16:57 - 17:02)
you're probably because you said that as (17:00 - 17:04)
the hawaiian growing up like you did (17:02 - 17:07)
this but like i think that for some (17:04 - 17:08)
people (17:07 - 17:09)
it's a little (17:08 - 17:12)
not great like to see that like (17:09 - 17:13)
some of the times i've been handling a (17:12 - 17:15)
salamander and then the salamander just (17:13 - 17:16)
like (17:15 - 17:18)
yolos its tail into the world i feel (17:16 - 17:20)
really bad and it's like really sad yeah (17:18 - 17:23)
it just eats it like i just feel really (17:20 - 17:24)
bad and it's actually it's like it is (17:23 - 17:27)
kind of gruesome but i guess this is the (17:24 - 17:29)
game separately they grow back so it's (17:27 - 17:31)
not it takes a long time for them to (17:29 - 17:33)
grow back though and like (17:31 - 17:35)
so that's that's another thing is is (17:33 - 17:37)
this a move that you can't use then for (17:35 - 17:39)
like a bunch more like you can only use (17:37 - 17:41)
it well it takes up a portion of your (17:39 - 17:44)
health right so you have to have health (17:41 - 17:46)
in order to pay for the move yeah that (17:44 - 17:48)
makes sense (17:46 - 17:51)
um i also noticed that in the artwork on (17:48 - 17:53)
because they did add it to the official (17:51 - 17:53)
website (17:53 - 17:55)
[Music] (17:53 - 17:57)
uh the handle bars that allow you to (17:55 - 17:59)
ride this little (17:57 - 18:02)
dude uh are on the saddle and not on the (17:59 - 18:04)
actual pokemon (18:02 - 18:06)
unlike the legendaries that seem to (18:04 - 18:09)
create its own handlebars (18:06 - 18:12)
this one is is handle bar free (18:09 - 18:13)
[Music] (18:12 - 18:15)
so i feel like given how they show (18:13 - 18:17)
things that fly (18:15 - 18:19)
that you won't be able to get access to (18:17 - 18:21)
moves like fly (18:19 - 18:23)
until it evolves (18:21 - 18:26)
into one of the legendaries (18:23 - 18:27)
and it makes sense that they showed the (18:26 - 18:28)
legendary because they'd already shown (18:27 - 18:31)
off the box they showed the legendaries (18:28 - 18:33)
riding around on the legendaries first (18:31 - 18:37)
so i i do think that you do have to (18:33 - 18:39)
take a quest to evolve it somehow and (18:37 - 18:42)
that it will stay dragon and not that (18:39 - 18:44)
will drop the normal typing for for (18:42 - 18:47)
whatever the legendary that's reasonable (18:44 - 18:48)
um (18:47 - 18:51)
so other pokemon that we saw in this (18:48 - 18:53)
trailer so that we can do our confirmed (18:51 - 18:56)
pokemon paladin pokemon list uh so we (18:53 - 18:58)
have colossal (18:56 - 19:01)
that we saw we saw tyranitar yep (18:58 - 19:03)
and we saw the new ghost (19:01 - 19:05)
uh crown (19:03 - 19:06)
what we've seen what the ghost thing (19:05 - 19:08)
which it just looks like a boo (19:06 - 19:10)
uh and that boo as in (19:08 - 19:14)
the person who i is my romantic partner (19:10 - 19:16)
boo as in from mario yeah um but it's (19:14 - 19:18)
also from the first (19:16 - 19:21)
gen one um (19:18 - 19:23)
lavender tower when you ran into the (19:21 - 19:26)
ghosts that didn't um that you couldn't (19:23 - 19:28)
tell what they were it's using that (19:26 - 19:30)
artwork which is very cool (19:28 - 19:32)
uh (19:30 - 19:33)
galad (19:32 - 19:35)
galead (19:33 - 19:37)
and (19:35 - 19:40)
who else did we see that was new oh (19:37 - 19:43)
we saw a little rotom oven (19:40 - 19:46)
uh who's out braylon fighting type we (19:43 - 19:48)
saw morrison titan (19:46 - 19:51)
well yeah resuscitating again my (19:48 - 19:53)
my boo my boo (19:51 - 19:54)
so (19:53 - 19:56)
there were some other that were kind of (19:54 - 19:58)
covered up by graphics so that was a (19:56 - 19:59)
little (19:58 - 20:00)
uh (19:59 - 20:01)
cody what do you think of the hats (20:00 - 20:03)
what's your opinion on the hats like the (20:01 - 20:06)
terrastilization hats (20:03 - 20:08)
um (20:06 - 20:08)
i just can't not think of a ring pop (20:09 - 20:13)
yeah (20:12 - 20:15)
for (20:13 - 20:18)
for normal type um but i do really like (20:15 - 20:20)
them like i think it's a really pretty (20:18 - 20:21)
phenomenon (20:20 - 20:24)
um i meant to look and see if terrastol (20:21 - 20:27)
like if there's some type of um language (20:24 - 20:30)
like spanish to that (20:27 - 20:32)
um i mean it's it sounds like crystal (20:30 - 20:36)
right so uh and you know one thing bobby (20:32 - 20:39)
mentioned that kind of (20:36 - 20:41)
stuck in my head i don't have all the (20:39 - 20:43)
right words but i think i can say it (20:41 - 20:45)
this way because bobby mentioned that (20:43 - 20:47)
they looked like the crystals (20:45 - 20:50)
that his mother collects (20:47 - 20:51)
right and it's like a little little (20:50 - 20:53)
crystal animals you have us like in a (20:51 - 20:55)
display case or something right they're (20:53 - 20:56)
just like (20:55 - 20:58)
and i'm like well at least they went (20:56 - 21:01)
that way and not like those ceramic (20:58 - 21:04)
like the little ceramic children (21:01 - 21:06)
oh the the humble figurine (21:04 - 21:09)
figure yeah (21:06 - 21:09)
that would have been so bad (21:09 - 21:14)
i mean it would have been (21:12 - 21:17)
perfect for the uh truck stop focus (21:14 - 21:19)
centers like because that's where you (21:17 - 21:20)
see all those figurines you see all (21:19 - 21:22)
those little crystal things in the (21:20 - 21:24)
little display case that nobody buys but (21:22 - 21:25)
every kid wants (21:24 - 21:27)
for no good reason (21:25 - 21:30)
all right so for competitive going on (21:27 - 21:32)
with the trailer (21:30 - 21:34)
uh they have (21:32 - 21:35)
the way i want to say this is they (21:34 - 21:37)
always show (21:35 - 21:38)
new items that nobody's ever going to (21:37 - 21:40)
use um (21:38 - 21:43)
an item called mirror herb or if you're (21:40 - 21:46)
in the uk mirror herb (21:43 - 21:48)
just want to make sure that everybody (21:46 - 21:49)
can understand (21:48 - 21:52)
uh which copies an opponent's stat (21:49 - 21:55)
increases when consumed (21:52 - 21:55)
so i i have like in single battles hey (21:56 - 22:03)
great i have a feeling in double battles (22:00 - 22:04)
since (22:03 - 22:07)
it doesn't necessarily (22:04 - 22:09)
it feels like how synchronized will pick (22:07 - 22:12)
one of the two i have a feeling that if (22:09 - 22:16)
both pokemon do a stat increase it will (22:12 - 22:18)
pick one of the two which makes it i (22:16 - 22:19)
think (22:18 - 22:20)
potentially less (22:19 - 22:21)
great (22:20 - 22:24)
probably whichever one goes first yeah (22:21 - 22:25)
probably (22:24 - 22:27)
but then like i mean i (22:25 - 22:30)
i think it's a very interesting item (22:27 - 22:32)
really and they showed it in in single (22:30 - 22:34)
battles because the belly drum thing was (22:32 - 22:36)
like yeah that's an amazing use of that (22:34 - 22:38)
but (22:36 - 22:38)
what else is it really good for where (22:39 - 22:42)
you get that big of a stat increase (22:41 - 22:46)
because it's used up once it happens yes (22:42 - 22:49)
consumable that's what so that is (22:46 - 22:51)
i don't know i feel like what was the (22:49 - 22:54)
one that was um a room service that was (22:51 - 22:56)
trick room (22:54 - 22:58)
focus that never got any use yep i feel (22:56 - 23:00)
like it's a good idea but i don't know (22:58 - 23:02)
how practical it will be so when would (23:00 - 23:05)
you consume it like (23:02 - 23:08)
right after your opponent's stat changes (23:05 - 23:10)
so it's an item that your pokemon holds (23:08 - 23:13)
yeah and then it the like your opponent (23:10 - 23:15)
does a thing and then you consume that (23:13 - 23:18)
and then it's gone and it doesn't happen (23:15 - 23:20)
yeah i think it would be the first one (23:18 - 23:22)
that i would encounter the question is (23:20 - 23:25)
like does mir herb (23:22 - 23:28)
work on poke pokemon whose (23:25 - 23:30)
ability is recycled so can it come back (23:28 - 23:32)
through recycle yeah but i don't think (23:30 - 23:34)
so because i think that only does (23:32 - 23:36)
berries i don't think it does (23:34 - 23:38)
i don't know i don't remember everything (23:36 - 23:39)
that really harvest right harvest is (23:38 - 23:41)
enough yeah harvest is berries recycle (23:39 - 23:43)
is something else (23:41 - 23:44)
[Music] (23:43 - 23:46)
i'd have to look it up now i'm into it (23:44 - 23:47)
now now that i thought about it not that (23:46 - 23:49)
there's ever been a competitive pokemon (23:47 - 23:52)
with the recycle ability right (23:49 - 23:55)
um all right another recycle is a move (23:52 - 23:57)
oh okay okay (23:55 - 24:00)
that's still oof which is good on (23:57 - 24:02)
um (24:00 - 24:04)
so recycle allows the user to gain a (24:02 - 24:07)
held item so the the thing is is the big (24:04 - 24:09)
user of that is snorlax right (24:07 - 24:12)
so if snorlax has (24:09 - 24:15)
the herb it can recycle to get it back (24:12 - 24:17)
to (24:15 - 24:19)
do whatever so like a porygon i think (24:17 - 24:21)
also can get recycled so there's (24:19 - 24:24)
potential because porygon is a lot so i (24:21 - 24:25)
mean there are (24:24 - 24:28)
pokemon that use (24:25 - 24:28)
that could get multiple benefits from (24:28 - 24:32)
that i just don't know how practical (24:30 - 24:34)
that is actually it's also hard to say (24:32 - 24:36)
because we don't know what the new meta (24:34 - 24:37)
is going to look like with all the (24:36 - 24:39)
changes that come in this game (24:37 - 24:42)
i i like the idea i just i don't know if (24:39 - 24:45)
it's that practical yeah well it's too (24:42 - 24:48)
early to tell it's way too early um the (24:45 - 24:51)
other one item which (24:48 - 24:53)
is actually i think pretty good for the (24:51 - 24:55)
story mode uh loaded dice makes (24:53 - 24:57)
multi-strike moves more likely to hit (24:55 - 24:59)
more times (24:57 - 25:03)
does raise the question with me (24:59 - 25:07)
which which part is the emphasized part (25:03 - 25:09)
are they more likely to hit (25:07 - 25:10)
or (25:09 - 25:12)
are they more likely to go off multiple (25:10 - 25:14)
times right because like there's moves (25:12 - 25:17)
that it'll go off like two to five times (25:14 - 25:20)
yeah does it mean it's going to go off (25:17 - 25:23)
more like five times but still the hit (25:20 - 25:26)
accuracy is unchanged i think it's (25:23 - 25:28)
supposed to give more pokemon the (25:26 - 25:30)
ability skill link so scale link is the (25:28 - 25:32)
one that always hits five times and i (25:30 - 25:36)
think this lets anything that has (25:32 - 25:38)
multi-hit moves a chance to hit more (25:36 - 25:41)
than two so whether that says it (25:38 - 25:43)
increases it to three to five times or (25:41 - 25:46)
if it increases it to four to five times (25:43 - 25:48)
that that we don't know it showed four (25:46 - 25:51)
in the trailer i think it hit four times (25:48 - 25:52)
but it also (25:51 - 25:54)
fainted after four so it's like (25:52 - 25:56)
does it guarantee five does it increase (25:54 - 25:58)
the range to like (25:56 - 26:01)
how it exactly works is a question so (25:58 - 26:03)
you're not saying that it's gonna affect (26:01 - 26:04)
accuracy i don't think it will affect (26:03 - 26:07)
accuracy no that's how it how it reads i (26:04 - 26:08)
don't think it would either so there (26:07 - 26:11)
would be like one random roll that's (26:08 - 26:14)
like does it hit or not and if it does (26:11 - 26:17)
hit then these loaded dice are going to (26:14 - 26:19)
mean that you hit more (26:17 - 26:21)
but it doesn't hit whether or not it (26:19 - 26:22)
doesn't like change whether or not the (26:21 - 26:25)
move lands it just changes if when it (26:22 - 26:27)
does land (26:25 - 26:29)
it it hits hard (26:27 - 26:31)
no it's it's it's the number of times it (26:29 - 26:32)
goes off (26:31 - 26:33)
yeah (26:32 - 26:37)
and there's a lot of multi-hit (26:33 - 26:40)
items are are things so when i think (26:37 - 26:44)
about competitive like multi-hit (26:40 - 26:47)
ones are good for things like focus (26:44 - 26:48)
sashes right because it the first one (26:47 - 26:51)
will break the sash and the continuing (26:48 - 26:53)
ones will do the rest of the damage and (26:51 - 26:54)
hopefully knock out whereas it would be (26:53 - 26:56)
stopped (26:54 - 26:57)
um (26:56 - 27:00)
so i don't know if like this is (26:57 - 27:02)
enough of a boost to really make those (27:00 - 27:05)
see a lot of play (27:02 - 27:05)
all right (27:06 - 27:09)
the last thing that was revealed is a (27:07 - 27:13)
move called hidden power that yep yeah (27:09 - 27:15)
i'm sorry now they brought back hidden (27:13 - 27:16)
power everybody (27:15 - 27:20)
blast uh changes type when the user has (27:16 - 27:22)
terrastilized (27:20 - 27:25)
um so i suspect from actually from what (27:22 - 27:27)
they showed because they showed a (27:25 - 27:30)
tyranitar that gained ghost type so that (27:27 - 27:32)
couldn't be hit by the what would have (27:30 - 27:35)
been super effective fighting type the (27:32 - 27:37)
fight type yeah that fighting type went (27:35 - 27:42)
through it did a ghost type attack (27:37 - 27:44)
against glade which glade's gonna be (27:42 - 27:46)
super which would be super effective (27:44 - 27:49)
against glee they also showed what was (27:46 - 27:51)
interesting is they showed uh colossal (27:49 - 27:53)
change to water type (27:51 - 27:56)
which made the water move (27:53 - 27:58)
not very effective and still activated (27:56 - 28:01)
the ability of colossal which (27:58 - 28:04)
yeah i i think of the things they showed (28:01 - 28:06)
uh terrastolize and (28:04 - 28:09)
uh terra blast are probably the biggest (28:06 - 28:11)
game changers like they're going to be (28:09 - 28:14)
definite competitive advantages to (28:11 - 28:15)
[Music] (28:14 - 28:18)
altering their type and then using this (28:15 - 28:21)
new hidden power like i think (28:18 - 28:23)
this also lends me to think that they (28:21 - 28:25)
are going to really hyper control the (28:23 - 28:27)
types of terror pokemon that are out (28:25 - 28:28)
there i (28:27 - 28:31)
don't disagree (28:28 - 28:31)
i think you're going to be able to (28:34 - 28:38)
tailor your pterotype to (28:35 - 28:40)
whatever you want it to be (28:38 - 28:43)
the dlc will will create uh tara candy (28:40 - 28:45)
that will allow you to switch types (28:43 - 28:47)
um i think that they're really trying to (28:45 - 28:50)
get at people like (28:47 - 28:51)
like if (28:50 - 28:53)
like they want you to go searching for (28:51 - 28:55)
the terror type that you want so like (28:53 - 28:58)
for example they would only have um (28:55 - 29:01)
tyranitar or larvitar or whatever like (28:58 - 29:03)
they'd only have the ghost type (29:01 - 29:04)
tyranitar (29:03 - 29:06)
it's like super rare to get and so (29:04 - 29:10)
they're gonna make you go looking for it (29:06 - 29:12)
um versus like i don't know if they'll (29:10 - 29:13)
ever (29:12 - 29:15)
add something that makes you lets you (29:13 - 29:18)
just change it to swap it willy-nilly (29:15 - 29:20)
yeah we think about dynamaxx and then (29:18 - 29:24)
suddenly they added soup so that's true (29:20 - 29:27)
uh so steam engine increases speed when (29:24 - 29:30)
you're hit by a fire or water type move (29:27 - 29:32)
yeah so that makes sense right it's like (29:30 - 29:33)
it reduces the effectiveness of the (29:32 - 29:35)
water type move and then he still gets (29:33 - 29:37)
the or it still gets the (29:35 - 29:40)
speed boost (29:37 - 29:42)
all right anything else to say about the (29:40 - 29:43)
trailer the (29:42 - 29:47)
is a good trailer um i think even even (29:43 - 29:48)
though i don't do competitive i think it (29:47 - 29:50)
made me (29:48 - 29:53)
excited for (29:50 - 29:55)
just battling in games like gyms could (29:53 - 29:56)
be potentially way more interesting the (29:55 - 29:58)
battles there could be way more (29:56 - 30:00)
interesting like there's new things to (29:58 - 30:01)
play with even though i don't do (30:00 - 30:03)
competitive (30:01 - 30:05)
so you said it was a zero out of ten (30:03 - 30:07)
game before it's still a zero out of ten (30:05 - 30:09)
game because they have not shown the one (30:07 - 30:11)
pokemon that will raise that score (30:09 - 30:13)
okay (30:11 - 30:16)
uh that what's that one somebody said (30:13 - 30:18)
barquette and i'm like no barquette is (30:16 - 30:21)
that's french that's not pal dean that's (30:18 - 30:23)
not (30:21 - 30:26)
does spain have a specific bread (30:23 - 30:27)
is that what you're wanting like you're (30:26 - 30:29)
watching oh evolution (30:27 - 30:31)
[Music] (30:29 - 30:32)
no no no greg's just looking for an (30:31 - 30:34)
evolution but if (30:32 - 30:36)
you want to wait it's (30:34 - 30:39)
pokemon is yeah but i am waiting for one (30:36 - 30:41)
very specific pokemon to be shown (30:39 - 30:43)
sometimes there's no way (30:41 - 30:46)
there's no way spam spanish rose (30:43 - 30:49)
everybody said that about snubble (30:46 - 30:52)
and galar and what didn't happen (30:49 - 30:53)
that's (30:52 - 30:56)
they literally just featured (30:53 - 30:59)
it at the world championships (30:56 - 31:01)
they it's gonna be there they have (30:59 - 31:03)
crushed my heart before and until they (31:01 - 31:06)
uncrush my heart it is a 0 out of 10 (31:03 - 31:08)
game i did like i did like the way that (31:06 - 31:10)
the battles like (31:08 - 31:12)
not just the battles themselves (31:10 - 31:14)
but (31:12 - 31:16)
yes you're not in a stadium any longer (31:14 - 31:18)
but you're like it's kind of like (31:16 - 31:20)
actually what pocket tournament was like (31:18 - 31:22)
where you're outside and there's people (31:20 - 31:26)
cheering like npcs around it's not this (31:22 - 31:29)
sterile empty environment two pokemon (31:26 - 31:34)
enter one pokemon leaves type thing (31:29 - 31:34)
uh (31:35 - 31:37)
actually we didn't include this in the (31:36 - 31:39)
news and they only put it as a little (31:37 - 31:41)
snip down at the bottom of the email (31:39 - 31:43)
message we all some of us got today uh (31:41 - 31:45)
pocket tournament will be free (31:43 - 31:47)
uh if you are a nintendo online (31:45 - 31:50)
subscriber for there's gonna be a trial (31:47 - 31:51)
where you can play the full download and (31:50 - 31:53)
play the full game but it's no longer (31:51 - 31:56)
gonna be part of competition that's fine (31:53 - 31:57)
i think uh (31:56 - 32:00)
there were eight people total who (31:57 - 32:02)
watched it on twitch (32:00 - 32:04)
i had no idea what it was (32:02 - 32:06)
wait wait wait wait i have the i have (32:04 - 32:08)
like my initial number wait let me look (32:06 - 32:10)

my feet just a short while ago (32:10 - 32:17)
oh yes it was the least watched um (32:14 - 32:20)
so there were 580 people who watched uh (32:17 - 32:23)
pokken tournament on twitch the next (32:20 - 32:27)
least watched was pokemon unite with (32:23 - 32:29)
three thousand (32:27 - 32:32)

verners because i really don't like (33:35 - 33:40)
verner's soda and it started (33:36 - 33:42)
a flame (33:40 - 33:45)

somebody replied they're like this isn't (33:45 - 33:48)
about you (33:47 - 33:51)
it was verner's cherry soda i haven't (33:48 - 33:54)

invites me to enjoy a soda and a snack (33:54 - 33:59)
in every one of his tick tocks and i'm (33:56 - 34:01)
telling him the soda he's offering me i (33:59 - 34:04)
don't like so please if he's trying to (34:01 - 34:06)
invite me to something i enjoy let's (34:04 - 34:09)
swap out the soda friend (34:06 - 34:10)
all right (34:09 - 34:13)
dare you no i feel that way too so i (34:10 - 34:15)
just went uh like a couple weekends ago (34:13 - 34:17)
i went to a bachelorette party and we (34:15 - 34:19)
all had um she had a shirt the bride had (34:17 - 34:22)
a shirt said uh bruised before i do's (34:19 - 34:24)
and we all had shirts that said brew her (34:22 - 34:27)
brew crew and i contacted the person who (34:24 - 34:28)
was making the shirts and i was like can (34:27 - 34:30)
i have a designated driver shirt because (34:28 - 34:32)
i don't drink and i'm not a part of the (34:30 - 34:35)
brew crew like (34:32 - 34:38)
feel included in this experience (34:35 - 34:39)
i need a shirt that says that i don't (34:38 - 34:41)
drink (34:39 - 34:43)
is it very obvious we (34:41 - 34:46)
missed one item they they hid it this is (34:43 - 34:47)
probably going to be the most important (34:46 - 34:49)
item that's why they didn't put it in (34:47 - 34:50)
the video (34:49 - 34:52)
and they snuck it away (34:50 - 34:55)
uh or tucked it away um greg what was it (34:52 - 34:59)
called uh it's the covert cloak covert (34:55 - 35:01)
cloak (34:59 - 35:04)
it's a hoodie that your pokemon wears (35:01 - 35:07)
making it a terrible item for me (35:04 - 35:09)
because you hate hoodies i hate hoodies (35:07 - 35:10)
well is that well it's a cloak it's a (35:09 - 35:11)
cloak (35:10 - 35:14)
it's a hooded cloak all right so (35:11 - 35:16)
that's it's a little halfway between (35:14 - 35:17)
them both of them (35:16 - 35:19)
um (35:17 - 35:22)
this hooded cloak conceals the holder (35:19 - 35:25)
protecting it from the additional (35:22 - 35:28)
effects of moves (35:25 - 35:29)
uh (35:28 - 35:32)
so in the screenshots and why this is (35:29 - 35:36)
the why people are like oh my gosh (35:32 - 35:40)
it stopped the flinch from fake out (35:36 - 35:42)
so they took damage from fake out but (35:40 - 35:43)
they didn't fly they didn't take the (35:42 - 35:48)
flinch so it's any secondary (35:43 - 35:50)
effect effect of a move and it doesn't (35:48 - 35:51)
look like it was (35:50 - 35:53)
consumed (35:51 - 35:54)
nope but it doesn't say that it doesn't (35:53 - 35:56)
say it's consumable yeah (35:54 - 35:57)
so (35:56 - 36:00)
the thing is is like (35:57 - 36:02)
skull's secondary effect is burned so if (36:00 - 36:04)
you have it on you probably can never (36:02 - 36:06)
get burned like this is actually like (36:04 - 36:08)
they hit this away uh not in the trailer (36:06 - 36:11)
because i think like this is a this is (36:08 - 36:13)
actually a big thing for (36:11 - 36:16)
changing the game a lot i definitely (36:13 - 36:18)
because if you think about it (36:16 - 36:21)
prankster which has been such like this (36:18 - 36:23)
it's been at the forefront for a very (36:21 - 36:26)
long time the whole point (36:23 - 36:29)
of having prankster is that you get your (36:26 - 36:32)
one pokemon in there to do his dealy (36:29 - 36:33)
first that's going to cause the flinch (36:32 - 36:36)
or you know cause (36:33 - 36:38)
whatever secondary effect or or you want (36:36 - 36:41)
your function to set up (36:38 - 36:43)
screens and they were always stopped by (36:41 - 36:44)
fake out right (36:43 - 36:47)
because fake out had priority six and (36:44 - 36:49)
prankster does it like priority four or (36:47 - 36:51)
whatever prankster moves it to (36:49 - 36:55)
so like this is a big thing that if you (36:51 - 36:57)
have a screen user (36:55 - 36:58)
and they think you have to stop your (36:57 - 37:00)
screens while you're wearing the cloak (36:58 - 37:02)
so you don't get flinched and you still (37:00 - 37:04)
set up the screens and fake out isn't a (37:02 - 37:06)
powerful move (37:04 - 37:08)
so like that is a big (37:06 - 37:09)
that's the thing that people are going (37:08 - 37:12)
to have to i think play around now like (37:09 - 37:15)
pokemon are going to have this and setup (37:12 - 37:17)
pokemon are probably the ones that are (37:15 - 37:19)
going to carry it i would imagine (37:17 - 37:21)
well they're more than like a swap or (37:19 - 37:24)
thief or something like that (37:21 - 37:26)
so this would include things like like (37:24 - 37:29)
you're saying like burns being confused (37:26 - 37:33)
freeze well so it wouldn't like (37:29 - 37:35)
that's that's the trick right yeah like (37:33 - 37:37)
will of the wisp (37:35 - 37:39)
right i think just causes burn right (37:37 - 37:40)
yeah so it's one that would be a (37:39 - 37:43)
secondary like if you (37:40 - 37:45)
like flame wheel or something (37:43 - 37:47)
any of those fire type moves that can (37:45 - 37:51)
cause a burn will never cause a burn (37:47 - 37:52)
but they will just do their initial (37:51 - 37:54)
damage (37:52 - 37:56)
interesting or like (37:54 - 37:58)
uh gosh what is that move that i was (37:56 - 37:59)
just (37:58 - 38:02)
using the other day um (37:59 - 38:04)
the one like ones that cause splinters (38:02 - 38:06)
as a secondary like that also wouldn't (38:04 - 38:08)
happen there's no splinters or like rap (38:06 - 38:11)
like you get bound oh yeah oh i wonder (38:08 - 38:12)
what happens (38:11 - 38:13)
huh (38:12 - 38:14)
yeah (38:13 - 38:15)
like there's a lot of things that are (38:14 - 38:18)
set that i'm curious how the secondary (38:15 - 38:19)
thing (38:18 - 38:22)
uh will yeah will happen (38:19 - 38:24)
lots of questions (38:22 - 38:26)
all right (38:24 - 38:27)
on (38:26 - 38:29)
to pokemon (38:27 - 38:33)
masters e x (38:29 - 38:36)
do you want to say the who is right (38:33 - 38:37)
i mean (38:36 - 38:38)
is that what you want to go with first (38:37 - 38:41)
greg greg was right yeah i was right (38:38 - 38:43)
nobody disagreed with him (38:41 - 38:44)
also like (38:43 - 38:47)
disagree with me (38:44 - 38:47)
oh there's gonna be a new generation of (38:48 - 38:52)
pokemon after pal dia like (38:49 - 38:54)
we have no guarantees (38:52 - 38:55)
like (38:54 - 38:56)
there was no way this wasn't gonna (38:55 - 38:59)
happen anyway explain what the big (38:56 - 39:01)
big thing is the big reveal is ash and (38:59 - 39:04)
pikachu are confirmed (39:01 - 39:08)
to be a sink pair that are coming to (39:04 - 39:09)
uh (39:08 - 39:11)
pokemon masters ex for the third (39:09 - 39:14)
anniversary anniversary they are coming (39:11 - 39:16)
earlier than the third anniversary so (39:14 - 39:19)
the third anniversary is the 25th i (39:16 - 39:21)
think but you'll be able to start (39:19 - 39:24)
pulling ash on (39:21 - 39:26)
the 17th (39:24 - 39:28)
which potentially makes ash bait because (39:26 - 39:29)
we don't know what else they're (39:28 - 39:32)
releasing from the anniversary so this (39:29 - 39:35)
is september september 25th october 25th (39:32 - 39:38)
october i mean august 25th is the third (39:35 - 39:39)
year anniversary (39:38 - 39:43)
okay so three days after yeah three days (39:39 - 39:45)
so ash comes out on this program comes (39:43 - 39:48)
out so well wait we're on the 21st today (39:45 - 39:49)
greg (39:48 - 39:50)
yeah (39:49 - 39:53)
so ash is out he will be able to scout (39:50 - 39:55)
this thing could be wrong (39:53 - 39:57)
i think it starts (39:55 - 39:59)
we're already four days past the 17th (39:57 - 40:02)
yeah the thing i'm reading is is is (39:59 - 40:03)
saying you'll be able to kind of the (40:02 - 40:06)
17th i'm like that doesn't seem right (40:03 - 40:09)
uh i think it comes out tuesday maybe (40:06 - 40:11)
let me look at another let me look at my (40:09 - 40:13)
other list (40:11 - 40:16)
27 they may event the 27th (40:13 - 40:18)
which would be not tuesday which would (40:16 - 40:19)
be (40:18 - 40:21)
which would be right when that's what (40:19 - 40:22)
right when the three year half (40:21 - 40:25)
27th makes more sense (40:22 - 40:27)
uh so we don't know what else is coming (40:25 - 40:28)
out for the third anniversary but we do (40:27 - 40:32)
know they're adding something called (40:28 - 40:35)
the trainers lodged (40:32 - 40:36)
yes (40:35 - 40:39)
and what is the trainer's lodge if you (40:36 - 40:42)
liked pokemon and me or pokemon camping (40:39 - 40:44)
where you could make friends with (40:42 - 40:46)
your pokemon (40:44 - 40:48)
welcome to the trainer's lodge (40:46 - 40:50)
where you can become friends with the (40:48 - 40:52)
trainers (40:50 - 40:56)
so this seems to be a friendship-based (40:52 - 40:58)
system (40:56 - 41:00)
what the friendship does (40:58 - 41:02)
we don't know yet (41:00 - 41:03)
um (41:02 - 41:07)
but the lodge is you will (41:03 - 41:10)
be bonding with (41:07 - 41:12)
your other sink pairs so you'll be (41:10 - 41:14)
having conversations and stories with (41:12 - 41:19)
like cynthia and sycamore and (41:14 - 41:23)
uh lily uh or whoever i don't know if (41:19 - 41:24)
it doesn't really say (41:23 - 41:26)
if everybody's gonna be in the trainer's (41:24 - 41:29)
lodge if only certain ones are gonna be (41:26 - 41:31)
in the trainer's lodge (41:29 - 41:32)
um (41:31 - 41:34)
but it is (41:32 - 41:36)
basically pokemon on me for your sink (41:34 - 41:39)
pairs so you can (41:36 - 41:42)
meet them and (41:39 - 41:44)
uh (41:42 - 41:45)
look i've gone to three different (41:44 - 41:47)
websites and they all say ash is coming (41:45 - 41:50)
at a different time (41:47 - 41:50)
so (41:51 - 41:56)
most likely it's the 25th which is the (41:53 - 41:57)
actual (41:56 - 41:59)
three-year anniversary so ash should be (41:57 - 42:01)
here on the 25th (41:59 - 42:03)
uh the trainer's lodge should also (42:01 - 42:06)
launch on the 25th the actual three-year (42:03 - 42:07)
anniversary (42:06 - 42:09)
um (42:07 - 42:10)
but yeah it (42:09 - 42:13)
we don't it doesn't say (42:10 - 42:15)
or i haven't seen i'm looking if they (42:13 - 42:20)
have stated what the benefit of (42:15 - 42:21)
being (42:20 - 42:25)
good friends with the other trainers (42:21 - 42:27)
does you get stronger (42:25 - 42:30)
relationships i do yeah i i mean it (42:27 - 42:33)
could just be like storyline stuff um (42:30 - 42:36)
they have talked about that (42:33 - 42:38)
so (42:36 - 42:42)
in the game if you have (42:38 - 42:43)
three from the same region they get a (42:42 - 42:45)
certain boost so like there's theme (42:43 - 42:47)
skills hidden in masters not really (42:45 - 42:49)
hidden but they're there so like (42:47 - 42:52)
one of the theme skills is fancy dress (42:49 - 42:54)
so if all of your pairs (42:52 - 42:58)
have a fancy dress they get a boost so (42:54 - 42:59)
the imagine (42:58 - 43:02)
sort of the imagining of what will this (42:59 - 43:04)
will be is you'll get a similar (43:02 - 43:06)
friendship boost (43:04 - 43:09)
and what that boost is i don't think (43:06 - 43:11)
we've seen i haven't seen listed (43:09 - 43:13)
anywhere so it's just another way for (43:11 - 43:16)
you to bond with the most common pairs (43:13 - 43:17)
that you use (43:16 - 43:22)
and will probably give some sort of (43:17 - 43:23)
boost (43:22 - 43:25)
um (43:23 - 43:26)
when you when you (43:25 - 43:29)
when those pairs are together the the (43:26 - 43:33)
question that i have about it though is (43:29 - 43:33)
is it only with your main character that (43:35 - 43:40)
this boost happens or can you create (43:38 - 43:42)
bonds between (43:40 - 43:45)
other sync pairs and happens with all of (43:42 - 43:47)
them because i honestly i don't use my (43:45 - 43:49)
own character that much (43:47 - 43:52)
um because (43:49 - 43:55)
you don't tend to need like pikachu or (43:52 - 43:57)
uh reggie steele or some of the other (43:55 - 44:00)
ones that much so the question is like (43:57 - 44:02)
are you able to (44:00 - 44:04)
connect with other ones are you able to (44:02 - 44:06)
get like cynthia and sycamore to be best (44:04 - 44:07)
friends um (44:06 - 44:10)
so there's a lot of questions i think (44:07 - 44:11)
that we don't have answers as far as (44:10 - 44:13)
what exactly it looks like but that is (44:11 - 44:15)
the big third year anniversary change (44:13 - 44:17)
that they're making and they're adding (44:15 - 44:19)
the trading lodge uh the official (44:17 - 44:21)
release video (44:19 - 44:25)
for ash says august 27th at 11 p.m (44:21 - 44:26)
pacific (44:25 - 44:27)
so (44:26 - 44:31)
august 28th basically for the rest of (44:27 - 44:34)
the world (44:31 - 44:37)
well no japan it'll be oh wait no that's (44:34 - 44:39)
international dateline alaska do they (44:37 - 44:42)
have a different time zone hawaii does (44:39 - 44:45)
hawaii does there you go (44:42 - 44:48)
all right so august 27th you can get ash (44:45 - 44:50)
uh it's after the three year anniversary (44:48 - 44:53)
so we don't have to be suspicious that (44:50 - 44:55)
other sneaky things are gonna get (44:53 - 44:58)
sneaked in there and uh we're good to go (44:55 - 44:59)
all right (44:58 - 45:02)
pokemon unite (44:59 - 45:03)
i (45:02 - 45:05)
was trying to understand how you (45:03 - 45:06)
pronounce the name they're they're (45:05 - 45:08)
introducing a new stadium it's in the (45:06 - 45:10)
clouds yep (45:08 - 45:14)
uh saya thea saya (45:10 - 45:17)
thea sky ruins (45:14 - 45:21)
that's how i was yeah it looks like thea (45:17 - 45:21)
i mean it yeah (45:22 - 45:26)
who knows their (45:24 - 45:30)
pronunciations are always wild anyways (45:26 - 45:33)
i mean it looks very similar to the (45:30 - 45:34)
standard (45:33 - 45:36)
stadium yeah (45:34 - 45:39)
so it's the same layout as the standard (45:36 - 45:40)
stadium (45:39 - 45:42)
it's got the two lanes the jungle in the (45:40 - 45:45)
middle the difference is (45:42 - 45:47)
that raymond quasar stars in the center (45:45 - 45:49)
instead of zapdos (45:47 - 45:53)
uh the apoms have been replaced with (45:49 - 45:55)
bundle b (45:53 - 45:58)
uh oh and there's like uh zatu is in (45:55 - 46:01)
there and a sel gore is in there in (45:58 - 46:02)
place of some of the other so the (46:01 - 46:04)
pokemon are switched around we don't (46:02 - 46:06)
know what uh (46:04 - 46:08)
raymond will actually do for the game (46:06 - 46:10)
like we're assuming it will behave (46:08 - 46:13)
exactly the same way that zapdos does (46:10 - 46:14)
i mean it could be totally different (46:13 - 46:16)
buffs and everything could be right the (46:14 - 46:18)
the whatever is going to be the resident (46:16 - 46:20)
pokemon in the top lane and whatever is (46:18 - 46:21)
the resident book pokemon in the bottom (46:20 - 46:23)
lane might be yeah completely different (46:21 - 46:24)
buffs (46:23 - 46:27)
um it doesn't seem like this (46:24 - 46:30)
will be a map for ranked (46:27 - 46:33)
that it seems like it is a special map (46:30 - 46:36)
that would be for standard battles (46:33 - 46:38)
um because it seems like this is a map (46:36 - 46:40)
that will (46:38 - 46:41)
phase out like a lot of their other (46:40 - 46:43)
special maps do (46:41 - 46:46)
um (46:43 - 46:46)
but again they didn't release a ton of (46:46 - 46:50)
information about it they've never done (46:48 - 46:53)
a special release video for the other (46:50 - 46:55)
theme maps and stuff yeah they have (46:53 - 46:57)
they've done well they've done for other (46:55 - 46:59)
events like they did this bosh rush map (46:57 - 47:02)
which was a limited (46:59 - 47:06)
uh time thing it comes and goes (47:02 - 47:07)
all right (47:06 - 47:08)
uh trying to tear (47:07 - 47:11)
is still way overpowered in that game it (47:08 - 47:12)
definitely needs to get (47:11 - 47:16)
he needs to get a nerf hardcore ttar (47:12 - 47:18)
he's taking it to everything to town man (47:16 - 47:20)
i was shocked color me surprised (47:18 - 47:23)
tyranitar needs to be puffed (47:20 - 47:26)
it is very expensive to get that pokemon (47:23 - 47:29)
they made that (47:26 - 47:31)
that's all it's a pricey that's a pricey (47:29 - 47:34)
one to buy (47:31 - 47:37)
all right cody added this one (47:34 - 47:39)
i should make cody read the article but (47:37 - 47:42)
i'll read the article we don't have to (47:39 - 47:43)
if you don't want to i just thought it (47:42 - 47:45)
was kotaku i know i think we've got to (47:43 - 47:46)
have some (47:45 - 47:48)
less serious news (47:46 - 47:51)
up in here this week uh all right so (47:48 - 47:53)
this is from kotaku.com the author is (47:51 - 47:55)
[ __ ] giong (47:53 - 47:58)
uh the title is (47:55 - 48:02)
mcdonald's pokemon card happy meals are (47:58 - 48:03)
back (48:02 - 48:05)
but fans aren't (48:03 - 48:07)
happy (48:05 - 48:10)
many adult pokemon fans were let down as (48:07 - 48:13)
they found basketball toys inside their (48:10 - 48:16)
kids meals it's a it's niantic's fault (48:13 - 48:18)
for like (48:16 - 48:22)
mixing the nba game with pokemon go man (48:18 - 48:24)
here we go (48:22 - 48:25)
when i left work on tuesday i (48:24 - 48:27)
immediately rushed to my nearest (48:25 - 48:29)
mcdonald's in order to secure pokemon (48:27 - 48:30)
cards from its latest happy meal (48:29 - 48:33)
promotion i bought two kids meals i do (48:30 - 48:35)
not have any children and i was slightly (48:33 - 48:37)
disappointed when the employee handed me (48:35 - 48:40)
two plain happy meal boxes i had been (48:37 - 48:42)
hoping to receive the pikachu printed (48:40 - 48:44)
boxes that were shown on the promotional (48:42 - 48:45)
ad (48:44 - 48:48)
but i got off lucky since each box still (48:45 - 48:50)
came with a pack of pokemon trading (48:48 - 48:51)
cards (48:50 - 48:52)
other customers who ordered the happy (48:51 - 48:55)
meals have reported receiving space jam (48:52 - 48:56)
2 toys (48:55 - 48:58)
[Music] (48:56 - 49:00)
the latest mcdonald's promotion is (48:58 - 49:02)
supposed to come with a pokemon spinner (49:00 - 49:05)
toy a cardboard pikachu eye (49:02 - 49:08)
cardboard pikachu coin and a pack of (49:05 - 49:10)
four trading cards one of which is (49:08 - 49:12)
holographic these toys are meant to be (49:10 - 49:15)
used in a party game in which one person (49:12 - 49:17)
spins the wheel to decide on a stat and (49:15 - 49:19)
then each player up to four compares (49:17 - 49:21)
their cards to determine who has the (49:19 - 49:22)
highest score (49:21 - 49:25)
obviously most adults who choose to buy (49:22 - 49:26)
the happy meals for themselves are (49:25 - 49:28)
mainly interested in obtaining the (49:26 - 49:31)
pokemon cards for a lot of customers who (49:28 - 49:33)
purchase the happy meal they get a very (49:31 - 49:36)
different kind of toy (49:33 - 49:37)
as you can imagine many were deeply (49:36 - 49:40)
unhappy about this error one twitter (49:37 - 49:43)
user had bought seven happy meals and (49:40 - 49:45)
all seven were toys from the animated (49:43 - 49:49)
cartoon starring lebron james (49:45 - 49:49)
one customer who had received a (49:49 - 49:52)
basketball themed toy pointed out that (49:51 - 49:54)
the mcdonald's app had asked the (49:52 - 49:56)
customer what kind of toy that they (49:54 - 49:57)
wanted (49:56 - 49:59)
the worst part of this is that space jam (49:57 - 50:02)
2 toys were distributed last summer as (49:59 - 50:05)
part of a promotion for the 2021 (50:02 - 50:06)
movie (50:05 - 50:08)
which means that these toys are (50:06 - 50:11)
extremely old leftovers rather than a (50:08 - 50:12)
mix up from the latest promotion from (50:11 - 50:14)
the last promotion (50:12 - 50:16)
before the pokemon collaboration happy (50:14 - 50:18)
meals came with toys from the marvel (50:16 - 50:20)
movie thor love and thunder one person (50:18 - 50:22)
reported receiving a love and thunder (50:20 - 50:25)
box that came with scooby-doo toy (50:22 - 50:27)
but the vast majority of mix-ups (50:25 - 50:30)
involved last year's space jam toys (50:27 - 50:32)
some reddit users have explained that (50:30 - 50:34)
many sores simply didn't have the (50:32 - 50:36)
pokemon shipment when the collaboration (50:34 - 50:37)
was announced so it might be worth (50:36 - 50:40)
waiting a few more days or calling ahead (50:37 - 50:42)
to make sure that your store has the (50:40 - 50:45)
packs happy hunting oh and leave some (50:42 - 50:47)
for the kids (50:45 - 50:49)
uh (50:47 - 50:50)
yes during last year's pokemon (50:49 - 50:53)
collaboration collectors and scalpers (50:50 - 50:54)
bought dozens of happy meals for the (50:53 - 50:57)
card packs many of these cards ended up (50:54 - 50:59)
being resold on ebay which might not (50:57 - 51:01)
have been a big deal if not for the fact (50:59 - 51:03)
that these cards and collectibles were (51:01 - 51:06)
primarily meant for children (51:03 - 51:07)
so before you buy out the entire (51:06 - 51:10)
restaurant please think about how sad a (51:07 - 51:13)
young pokemon fan would be if they found (51:10 - 51:16)
bugs bunny in their happy (51:13 - 51:19)
it all of a sudden becomes an unhappy (51:16 - 51:20)
meal (51:19 - 51:22)
man people ask (51:20 - 51:24)
is this what we've gotten to in 2022 is (51:22 - 51:26)
like i go up to the counter (51:24 - 51:28)
wanting a special type of happy meal and (51:26 - 51:30)
i don't start the conversation with do (51:28 - 51:33)
you have the pokemon toys (51:30 - 51:36)

no no no i verify before i give hand (51:43 - 51:49)
over my hard earned cash (51:46 - 51:49)

went to mcdonald's because it was i (51:54 - 51:57)
thought it was going to be quick and (51:57 - 51:59)
easy first of all those things don't go (51:57 - 52:03)
together that makes your headache worse (51:59 - 52:03)
the problem was i had a headache because (52:03 - 52:06)
i hadn't eaten in a while and i was like (52:04 - 52:08)

from noon to two (67:06 - 67:10)
if you've completed the first special (67:11 - 67:15)
research story you get (67:12 - 67:17)
a second one but only if you bought the (67:15 - 67:19)
ticket (67:17 - 67:22)
then from two to four (67:19 - 67:22)
you have to get (67:22 - 67:26)
finish the special the first special one (67:24 - 67:29)
for ticket people to get the second x (67:26 - 67:31)
research story and then from four to six (67:29 - 67:33)
you have to do the first two to get the (67:31 - 67:34)
third one (67:33 - 67:37)
so long as you claim the first special (67:34 - 67:38)

be able to complete it and any remaining (67:38 - 67:43)
special research stories whenever you (67:41 - 67:46)
want that's what's known in pokemon go (67:43 - 67:48)
land as the will anderson clause (67:46 - 67:50)
for the year that will anderson paid for (67:48 - 67:53)
pokemon go fest was not able to play on (67:50 - 67:55)
the day and never got the special reward (67:53 - 67:57)
for it (67:55 - 67:58)
oh good gracious (67:57 - 68:00)
uh in addition to pokemon listed above (67:58 - 68:02)
ticket holding traders encounter some (68:00 - 68:04)
additional pokemon when they use incense (68:02 - 68:08)
during each habitat period (68:04 - 68:10)
what kind of incense uh any incense well (68:08 - 68:12)
i mean the dahlians no (68:10 - 68:15)
maybe probably not just regular i wonder (68:12 - 68:16)
if you can use the day they should allow (68:15 - 68:19)
you to use the daily incense once per (68:16 - 68:21)
habitat (68:19 - 68:22)
now (68:21 - 68:23)
that's because then everybody's gonna (68:22 - 68:25)
get mad that the galerin birds are (68:23 - 68:28)
taking spots away from other pokemon (68:25 - 68:28)
all right (68:28 - 68:31)
uh so this is (68:28 - 68:32)
get a pad and paper before i start going (68:31 - 68:34)
through this one because you need to (68:32 - 68:35)
take notes (68:34 - 68:37)

option for (69:11 - 69:20)
unknown b g n o p s x clink and pampore (69:13 - 69:23)
and during the fourth habitat you have (69:20 - 69:25)
the options for unknown (69:23 - 69:30)
b g n o p s x tropius (69:25 - 69:33)
and frillish (69:30 - 69:35)
which cannot be shiny (69:33 - 69:37)
neither connect (69:35 - 69:39)
isn't tropius a (69:37 - 69:40)
regional (69:39 - 69:44)
it is regional to africa (69:40 - 69:45)
or it has been (69:44 - 69:48)
there's no logic to this but torque (69:45 - 69:52)
torquel is also regional (69:48 - 69:52)
and the sages the pans are all yeah the (69:54 - 69:59)
pans are all regionals yeah but like we (69:57 - 70:01)
have recently through these quests (69:59 - 70:03)
gotten access to them and this is (70:01 - 70:06)
boyfrilish so i don't know if boyfrilish (70:03 - 70:07)
is (70:06 - 70:09)
regional from girlfrilish we we're not (70:07 - 70:12)
that pokemon go sophisticated to have (70:09 - 70:15)
that much detail but if you know and if (70:12 - 70:18)
you care it it does say boyfrilish (70:15 - 70:21)
on the uh on the little news item here (70:18 - 70:22)
uh and then there's instructions if you (70:21 - 70:25)
go to pokemon go live um and just look (70:22 - 70:27)
at the news article for (70:25 - 70:29)
pokemon go fest finale (70:27 - 70:31)
the fastest (70:29 - 70:32)
uh (70:31 - 70:33)
there's instructions on how to buy a (70:32 - 70:36)
ticket if you need to buy a ticket um (70:33 - 70:37)
and i don't think they have instructions (70:36 - 70:40)
on how to gift a ticket but that's okay (70:37 - 70:42)
maybe you'll try to buy a ticket and (70:40 - 70:45)
somebody already bought one for you the (70:42 - 70:48)
dream how nice (70:45 - 70:48)

about how i really want to make sure (71:27 - 71:30)
well first of all because of (71:28 - 71:31)
my shiny work (71:30 - 71:32)
but (71:31 - 71:34)
um (71:32 - 71:35)
like i was thinking about like going to (71:34 - 71:36)
trying to do a meet up with y'all (71:35 - 71:39)
because i haven't seen you guys in like (71:36 - 71:41)
four four or five years (71:39 - 71:42)
it's very so (71:41 - 71:45)
because i saw you in pax pax east in (71:42 - 71:47)
2018. that was the last time i've seen (71:45 - 71:48)
all of you (71:47 - 71:50)
so i (71:48 - 71:51)
yes (71:50 - 71:53)
where are we gonna make steve do (71:51 - 71:55)
this that we're going to be able to (71:53 - 71:57)
tolerate and survive (71:55 - 71:58)
for eight hours (71:57 - 72:01)
people you tolerate so uh (71:58 - 72:04)
i was pushing for rice park in saint (72:01 - 72:05)
paul (72:04 - 72:06)
not familiar with that which over by the (72:05 - 72:08)
children's by the science museum there's (72:06 - 72:10)
a bunch of stuff like we can stop off (72:08 - 72:12)

paul nobody ever goes there you can tell (72:12 - 72:16)
that a bunch of drunk people design (72:15 - 72:18)
saint paul because none of the streets (72:16 - 72:20)
makes sense (72:18 - 72:20)
i mean (72:20 - 72:23)
i mean there's bathrooms in a lot of (72:21 - 72:25)
places he's i remember that from boston (72:23 - 72:27)

illustrator pikachu should be in a (77:16 - 77:21)
museum what other pokemon items do you (77:18 - 77:24)

museum (77:24 - 77:26)
ancient mew (77:25 - 77:28)
ancient mew me go grab what i think (77:26 - 77:29)

the gold burger king cards (77:29 - 77:34)
golden cards (77:31 - 77:34)
the adventure junior rpg that was only (77:35 - 77:41)
released once and never was seen again (77:38 - 77:46)
do we know who designed this (77:41 - 77:46)
uh (77:46 - 77:48)
that's (77:47 - 77:50)
probably (77:48 - 77:53)
the person who does the graphics for (77:50 - 77:55)

postcard that steve um (78:13 - 78:18)
it was for pride okay (78:16 - 78:19)
but he does (78:18 - 78:20)
like quarter does he do quarterly (78:19 - 78:23)
postcards for patreon subscribers (78:20 - 78:26)
at a certain level (78:23 - 78:29)
the card is based off of (78:26 - 78:32)
the hidden fates ekans which has that (78:29 - 78:34)
ekkans (78:32 - 78:35)
looking at the rainbow and of course any (78:34 - 78:37)
card that has rainbow in it is the gay (78:35 - 78:39)
version of that card this is an (78:37 - 78:42)
established fact so the postcard that (78:39 - 78:44)
steve made for patreon (78:42 - 78:46)
whatever tier that is i don't know i'm (78:44 - 78:48)
holding it changed it into the actual (78:46 - 78:52)
pride flag like the product the progress (78:48 - 78:54)
is what that one's (78:52 - 78:55)
yeah the progress but not the (78:54 - 78:58)
traditional pride flag but i when i (78:55 - 79:00)
opened my well i didn't even open (78:58 - 79:02)
because it was just in my mailbox but (79:00 - 79:04)
when i got my mail that day i was (79:02 - 79:06)
smiling so hard because this is just so (79:04 - 79:08)
cute it's very (79:06 - 79:10)
if you go to the youtube and while (79:08 - 79:12)
you're at the youtube hit like subscribe (79:10 - 79:14)
and notifications but (79:12 - 79:17)
at whatever hour mark minute mark this (79:14 - 79:18)
is (79:17 - 79:20)
then you can see cody holding up (79:18 - 79:23)
the postcard in question but yeah the uh (79:20 - 79:24)
at the patreon there is a certain level (79:23 - 79:27)
where you get steve mails you stuff (79:24 - 79:29)
mm-hmm i am not at that level so i have (79:27 - 79:31)
nothing (79:29 - 79:34)
it's above eight dollars (79:31 - 79:34)
i thought that because i'm also at eight (79:35 - 79:39)
dollars and i'm oh dang i guess i'm just (79:37 - 79:42)
getting snubbed you had to like (79:39 - 79:44)
opt-in almost like i think he was like (79:42 - 79:46)
let me know if you want all right and so (79:44 - 79:48)
i made sure (79:46 - 79:51)
what pokemon item do i think should be (79:48 - 79:55)
in a pokemon slash pop culture (79:51 - 79:57)
museum (79:55 - 79:59)
i think uh (79:57 - 80:02)
sugamori's original sketches (79:59 - 80:05)
whatever sketchbook that oh yeah (80:02 - 80:08)
yeah like draft designs of pokemon (80:05 - 80:10)
because it's like you when you get (80:08 - 80:12)
graphic novels like they'll always do (80:10 - 80:14)
like here's our original renderings of (80:12 - 80:15)
what we thought these characters would (80:14 - 80:17)
look like before like they actually did (80:15 - 80:19)
the final design of the characters and (80:17 - 80:21)
i'm like i want to see what those drafts (80:19 - 80:24)
look like all right (80:21 - 80:27)
uh a question from our addict channel (80:24 - 80:29)
this one's from (80:27 - 80:30)
uh koopa prez i'm not even gonna say (80:29 - 80:33)
their real name what event or (80:30 - 80:36)
competition would you add (80:33 - 80:39)
to worlds (80:36 - 80:39)
i mean they're they're pretty well (80:40 - 80:44)
covered even with uh pocket tournament (80:41 - 80:47)
which nobody seems to even want to play (80:44 - 80:49)
i always say pocket when it's poking (80:47 - 80:52)
pokken tournament i i think they should (80:49 - 80:55)
bring back ranger spin how can catch who (80:52 - 80:56)
can do the most spins (80:55 - 80:58)
ranger (80:56 - 81:00)
didn't you send me that thing of the (80:58 - 81:02)
giant (81:00 - 81:04)
because i found that you sent it to me (81:02 - 81:05)
and i said (81:04 - 81:07)
when he immediately stopped watching (81:05 - 81:09)
when he called the game pokemon rangers (81:07 - 81:11)
and i'm like you're doing a video about (81:09 - 81:12)
a video game and you can't even get the (81:11 - 81:15)
name of the video game correct 1980s (81:12 - 81:18)
will says no (81:15 - 81:18)
um what (81:19 - 81:23)
there's not a lot that they like (81:21 - 81:26)
everything that has a competition (81:23 - 81:28)
what they need to do so (81:26 - 81:29)
this (81:28 - 81:31)
this is this is the key for pokemon (81:29 - 81:32)
worlds (81:31 - 81:35)
this is where you can get because like (81:32 - 81:36)
i think (81:35 - 81:38)
the paxes (81:36 - 81:41)
do a version of this that's very (81:38 - 81:43)
popular so if you've if you've never (81:41 - 81:46)
gone to like a pax east southwest (81:43 - 81:48)
unplugged whatever (81:46 - 81:49)
they (81:48 - 81:51)
have a competition (81:49 - 81:53)
um when you buy your tickets for packs (81:51 - 81:54)
you can say i would like to be (81:53 - 81:57)
considered for this competition (81:54 - 81:59)
and they select i think it's maybe like (81:57 - 82:01)
eight or ten (81:59 - 82:02)
people who are attendees of the (82:01 - 82:04)
convention (82:02 - 82:06)
and they basically (82:04 - 82:07)
you (82:06 - 82:10)
are called on stage and have to play a (82:07 - 82:13)
game you may know how to play that game (82:10 - 82:15)
you may not know how to play that game (82:13 - 82:17)
but you compete (82:15 - 82:19)
so (82:17 - 82:22)
they just need to say pokemon worlds as (82:19 - 82:24)
the people are coming in do you want to (82:22 - 82:26)
play in the random pokemon competition (82:24 - 82:28)
this year and then it's like pokemon (82:26 - 82:31)
stadium mini games (82:28 - 82:35)
[Laughter] (82:31 - 82:37)
because i remember playing i played them (82:35 - 82:40)
by myself like against computers but i (82:37 - 82:43)
remember being amazing at those things (82:40 - 82:45)
and just loving playing this like i (82:43 - 82:46)
think because then you could do any of (82:45 - 82:48)
the any game that has a mini game yep (82:46 - 82:50)
you could just that could that could be (82:48 - 82:52)
what you have to end up playing it's (82:50 - 82:54)
like a ton of sushi (82:52 - 82:55)
you have to be good at all of those (82:54 - 82:56)
games (82:55 - 82:57)
yeah you know what else that i would (82:56 - 82:59)
want to see (82:57 - 83:01)
i want to see them do a supermarket (82:59 - 83:04)
sweep with the pokemon center instead of (83:01 - 83:07)
a supermarket oh no i love supermarket (83:04 - 83:09)
sleep what would you go for like what (83:07 - 83:10)
would be the like (83:09 - 83:12)
most expensive thing i mean you're going (83:10 - 83:14)
to go for the trainer boxes first (83:12 - 83:16)
obviously then you're going to go for (83:14 - 83:18)
the life size plushies (83:16 - 83:20)
okay but you gotta have to like yeah but (83:18 - 83:22)
you have to like get a good level in the (83:20 - 83:25)
cart because the plushies can sit on top (83:22 - 83:27)
because with the plushies in they're (83:25 - 83:28)
going to bounce the rest of the stuff (83:27 - 83:29)
off they're putting some skateboards (83:28 - 83:31)
underneath yeah skateboards (83:29 - 83:33)
like it's going to be like trainer boxes (83:31 - 83:36)
skateboards plushies (83:33 - 83:38)
well any of the tcg stuff is the highest (83:36 - 83:40)
value for the smallest volume yeah so (83:38 - 83:43)
you want to get as much of that (83:40 - 83:45)
as you can and that is your foundational (83:43 - 83:47)
layer but you cannot you have to admit (83:45 - 83:51)
that a 400 feel plushie (83:47 - 83:53)
is gonna get you across that finish line (83:51 - 83:56)
of supermarket suite i wonder like (83:53 - 84:00)
what if they knew which tcg card packs (83:56 - 84:02)
like had like you like sweep in that box (84:00 - 84:04)
or whatever and they knew they knew the (84:02 - 84:07)
value of the cards in that box so it's (84:04 - 84:08)
like totally random like because you (84:07 - 84:10)
could sweep in one and it's not that (84:08 - 84:12)
like it doesn't have that much value (84:10 - 84:14)
they can't there's so much risk that (84:12 - 84:16)
people think because they've had an (84:14 - 84:18)
issue in the past where the tcg box was (84:16 - 84:19)
mappable (84:18 - 84:22)
that even if they gave a hint that they (84:19 - 84:23)
knew (84:22 - 84:25)
in any way they performed people would (84:23 - 84:27)
be so (84:25 - 84:28)
angry (84:27 - 84:30)
would just be like it would be a fake in (84:28 - 84:32)
the supermarket sweet pokemon edition it (84:30 - 84:34)
would be a fake box yeah that's pr that (84:32 - 84:37)
wouldn't be real pr is going to come and (84:34 - 84:38)
bite you (84:37 - 84:40)
look the thing that i want is a speed (84:38 - 84:43)
drawing competition (84:40 - 84:46)
where you have like two minutes to draw (84:43 - 84:47)
whatever it is like the person you're (84:46 - 84:49)
like ready to draw right like ready to (84:47 - 84:51)
color whatever it is (84:49 - 84:53)
and they just say like (84:51 - 84:55)
psyduck and then you have to like you (84:53 - 84:57)
have to draw it (84:55 - 84:59)
you're judged on creativity you're (84:57 - 85:02)
judged on accuracy like you're judged on (84:59 - 85:03)
all of these things and so (85:02 - 85:05)
because they could just randomly pull (85:03 - 85:07)
out a pokemon and that everyone has (85:05 - 85:09)
forgotten about minior and like mini or (85:07 - 85:11)
lava form or whatever and then people (85:09 - 85:13)
like you have to just drop like you have (85:11 - 85:15)
to know what that looks like and be able (85:13 - 85:18)
to accurately like a blob of goo (85:15 - 85:21)
a cute little blob of you (85:18 - 85:22)
i think that would be super because like (85:21 - 85:24)
i do think that that's one thing that (85:22 - 85:26)
this is missing is a lot of people that (85:24 - 85:28)
these types of competitions miss is a (85:26 - 85:30)
lot of people are very artistic and are (85:28 - 85:32)
very creative (85:30 - 85:33)
hence (85:32 - 85:35)
beautiful art of (85:33 - 85:36)
like (85:35 - 85:39)
oh i'm not as i am (85:36 - 85:42)
okay speed knitting (85:39 - 85:44)
that's not a pokemon but no i think (85:42 - 85:47)
speed knitting already exists (85:44 - 85:48)
if you (85:47 - 85:50)
that competition in sweden or whatever (85:48 - 85:52)
no no no they do it here if (85:50 - 85:54)
if you're still on the east coast if i (85:52 - 85:56)
come back to the east coast for maryland (85:54 - 85:58)
sheep and wool we will go (85:56 - 86:00)
and because they do (85:58 - 86:02)
what it is it's um (86:00 - 86:04)
from the sheep (86:02 - 86:07)
like the wool is still on the sheep (86:04 - 86:08)
from that point (86:07 - 86:11)
to sweater who can do it they do it in (86:08 - 86:13)
teams but it's like who can do it (86:11 - 86:15)
fastest so someone has to share (86:13 - 86:16)
something (86:15 - 86:18)
clean spin (86:16 - 86:21)
how do you have all those skills between (86:18 - 86:23)
two people no no it's team it's more (86:21 - 86:24)
than two it's (86:23 - 86:27)
your team (86:24 - 86:27)
i think one person could know how to do (86:28 - 86:32)
all of those things it's just that (86:30 - 86:33)
there's gonna be parts that you're not (86:32 - 86:36)
as good at you also have your (86:33 - 86:38)
to start knitting before everything is (86:36 - 86:40)
spun right yeah (86:38 - 86:42)
okay competitive pokemon battle jose (86:40 - 86:43)
final answer (86:42 - 86:45)
um (86:43 - 86:49)
that's not competitive pokemon of the (86:45 - 86:53)
week last week's pokemon which greg (86:49 - 86:55)
probably doesn't know so (86:53 - 86:57)
cody i hope you're cool okay ready with (86:55 - 86:59)
an answer (86:57 - 87:00)
uh (86:59 - 87:03)
let me uh let me read three through it (87:00 - 87:05)
again this pokemon one of my favorites (87:03 - 87:08)
can exist in six possible varieties (87:05 - 87:11)
originally only three of those varieties (87:08 - 87:14)
could be caught with a pokeball in ultra (87:11 - 87:16)
sun and ultra moon four of those (87:14 - 87:18)
varieties could be caught with a (87:16 - 87:21)
pokeball one of the varieties can be (87:18 - 87:23)
seen while playing in the game but has (87:21 - 87:25)
never been able to be caught evolved or (87:23 - 87:29)
received through distribution (87:25 - 87:29)
it's (87:30 - 87:35)
um oh crap (87:33 - 87:36)
um (87:35 - 87:38)
oricorio i don't know (87:36 - 87:39)
i thought it was (87:38 - 87:41)
what version of rotom can you catch in a (87:39 - 87:44)
pokeball and you said evolved too and (87:41 - 87:45)
the second you said evolved i was like (87:44 - 87:47)
oof (87:45 - 87:51)
pokemon flowette it is float (87:47 - 87:55)
i have it i don't have it because (87:51 - 87:58)
the az's floette which has a weird black (87:55 - 88:01)
and red flower is actually in the game (87:58 - 88:03)
data as a pokemon you could potentially (88:01 - 88:06)
have but they never distributed it just (88:03 - 88:09)
just distributed it and we're still at (88:06 - 88:11)
that point where it's like it's been so (88:09 - 88:15)
long it's been 3 000 years release it (88:11 - 88:16)
but apparently we're not getting it for (88:15 - 88:19)
3 000 years mm-hmm (88:16 - 88:22)
i just i i i did have a number of people (88:19 - 88:24)
answer ro tom and i'm like what (88:22 - 88:27)
besides base bro so because (88:24 - 88:31)
because like i don't i only see (88:27 - 88:34)
oh because yeah i was i thought at first (88:31 - 88:36)
bought flabebe but then i was like that (88:34 - 88:39)
only has five versions (88:36 - 88:42)
correct i forgot that floette has the (88:39 - 88:45)
eternal flower that is unreal i mean so (88:42 - 88:47)
like i did i still need somebody to (88:45 - 88:49)
answer this question what version of (88:47 - 88:51)
rotom can you catch in a pokeball that's (88:49 - 88:55)
not base rotom wash (88:51 - 88:57)
where uh (88:55 - 88:59)
go (88:57 - 88:59)
doesn't count (89:00 - 89:04)
that's not a real pokemon i mean you can (89:02 - 89:07)
catch some of the forms in go (89:04 - 89:11)
in a pokeball so i don't think (89:07 - 89:11)
you can transform them you can't cut (89:17 - 89:21)
catch them in their you can catch row (89:19 - 89:23)
top but you can't catch their forms (89:21 - 89:25)
in our case (89:23 - 89:26)
okay (89:25 - 89:30)
but you cannot go (89:26 - 89:30)
i did catch the washing machine uh (89:30 - 89:35)
here's your trivia in the battle chateau (89:33 - 89:38)
baroness francine's flabebe uses (89:35 - 89:40)
floette's cry (89:38 - 89:41)
