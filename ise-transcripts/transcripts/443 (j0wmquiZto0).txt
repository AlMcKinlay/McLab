i'm back to work that's a thing that i'm (0:51 - 0:55)
doing around the house again i guess (0:53 - 0:57)
is leaving it for work no because you're (0:55 - 0:59)
working at home i have to work from home (0:57 - 1:01)

prefer to just pretend it doesn't exist (1:03 - 1:06)
i mean my work suddenly became a (1:05 - 1:08)
nightmare because (1:06 - 1:11)
half my company retired so i've applied (1:08 - 1:12)

[Music] (1:45 - 1:50)

fried chicken (1:50 - 1:54)
for pokemon plushies that we need to go (1:51 - 1:54)

first time we've covered an (2:11 - 2:16)
old article before (2:13 - 2:17)
it wasn't like it was like this (2:16 - 2:19)
revolutionary brand new thing we've done (2:17 - 2:20)
on this show (2:19 - 2:22)
yeah but twice is a pattern no i think (2:20 - 2:23)

an old article (2:23 - 2:28)
now we're in the weeds nobody can know (2:25 - 2:28)
stress (2:28 - 2:30)

but we might bump into twice a year (2:30 - 2:36)
you never know you never know no one's (2:33 - 2:38)
asking you pokemon company keep up with (2:36 - 2:41)
good timely news articles or we're gonna (2:38 - 2:43)

and seeing what we can uncover some (2:43 - 2:46)
people like the older stuff (2:45 - 2:50)
it's almost speaking of uh (2:46 - 2:54)

one's actually how can you say head (5:22 - 5:30)

million (11:16 - 11:19)
i've like i've got double what steve (11:17 - 11:21)
well because i never used stars (11:19 - 11:23)

battle league and stuff i mean i've (11:23 - 11:27)
leveled some pokemon that's about it (11:25 - 11:28)
yeah i bet will hasn't leveled up any (11:27 - 11:29)
pokemon (11:28 - 11:32)
why would i level up a pokemon so you're (11:29 - 11:32)
so you're (11:32 - 11:34)
so you can be the person in raids (11:32 - 11:36)
yelling at other people for using (11:34 - 11:39)
sub-optimal pokemon apparently there's a (11:36 - 11:40)
genesect nearby (11:39 - 11:41)
my house but i don't recognize the (11:40 - 11:43)
location so i (11:41 - 11:46)
have some ups and downs i like the catch (11:43 - 11:49)
tracker i think it's cool it gives you a (11:46 - 11:50)
reason to catch (11:49 - 11:53)
like a hurtier i (11:50 - 11:56)
i like how i checked it off but why why (11:53 - 11:57)
is it so limited (11:56 - 11:59)
why is drillburn not on the list i have (11:57 - 12:01)
four drillbar in my house right now why (11:59 - 12:01)
is this (12:01 - 12:03)
truck gilbert why is rubbish not on the (12:01 - 12:05)
list why is wrong wait where else is (12:03 - 12:06)
this gen 3 nevermind nor that way i (12:05 - 12:08)
i revised my previous statement i have (12:06 - 12:11)
actually caught none of these (12:08 - 12:13)
i just had the pictures of them which i (12:11 - 12:15)
thought meant i caught them (12:13 - 12:17)
well you have eight hours or six hours (12:15 - 12:18)
hours (12:17 - 12:21)
you can do it in oshawa right now it's (12:18 - 12:22)
really easy (12:21 - 12:24)
i'm just so confused why there's not an (12:22 - 12:25)
hour (12:24 - 12:27)
that i don't see a drill burr why is (12:25 - 12:30)
drillburn not on the list (12:27 - 12:32)
because it's too easy yeah like i have a (12:30 - 12:34)
time pole in my house too why is time (12:32 - 12:35)
pulling on the list what's the (12:34 - 12:37)
i believe that's tim paul thank you i (12:35 - 12:39)
think you're right i think i think it is (12:37 - 12:40)
temple (12:39 - 12:42)
for the drum thank you very much so i (12:40 - 12:43)
like it (12:42 - 12:46)
it's fine it means a whole week yeah (12:43 - 12:47)
it's a collector's thing (12:46 - 12:49)
you're over there i mean i'm way you (12:47 - 12:51)
know i'm way past that (12:49 - 12:53)
so you you legitimately sound like me (12:51 - 12:55)
when i was in high school when everybody (12:53 - 12:57)
else in my class like the day before an (12:55 - 12:58)
assignment would was due where it's like (12:57 - 12:59)
i (12:58 - 13:01)
i haven't done my essay yet i don't know (12:59 - 13:02)
what i'm gonna do and i'm like (13:01 - 13:06)
they gave us a whole week to do this (13:02 - 13:08)
there's things we care about and things (13:06 - 13:10)
we don't care about (13:08 - 13:13)
education came first i never wrote an (13:10 - 13:14)
essay (13:13 - 13:17)
until the night it was due i mean i went (13:14 - 13:19)
to design school so i didn't have to (13:17 - 13:20)
write essays i went to design school for (13:19 - 13:22)
high school (13:20 - 13:24)
i went to theater art i mean i got my (13:22 - 13:25)
degree in theater arts so (13:24 - 13:27)
to not ever have to write a paper again (13:25 - 13:29)
guess the drawbacks of studying war at (13:27 - 13:31)
georgetown university (13:29 - 13:34)
lots and lots of writing i mean (13:31 - 13:37)
i also for my job don't write until much (13:34 - 13:39)
closer to the due date (13:37 - 13:41)
like i my whole process of writing is (13:39 - 13:42)
terrible (13:41 - 13:44)
and i understand it but it works for me (13:42 - 13:46)
and also catching pokemon and pokemon go (13:44 - 13:48)
yeah well they need to show up and stay (13:46 - 13:49)
in the ball (13:48 - 13:52)

was gonna say (13:52 - 13:55)
about going outside and exploring which (13:53 - 13:57)
i guess is still true (13:55 - 13:59)
you can go outside safely greg no (13:57 - 14:02)
because it's really slippery out there (13:59 - 14:04)
uh it got up to 32 today yeah which (14:02 - 14:06)
means it melts and then it freezes (14:04 - 14:08)
yeah it's a little icy over here too (14:06 - 14:10)
nobody wants pikachu (14:08 - 14:13)
you're so tired dude okay last bit of (14:10 - 14:14)
pokemon go news here (14:13 - 14:16)
is well there's more but we're going to (14:14 - 14:18)
skip a lot of it (14:16 - 14:20)
i mean i mean like they rescheduled some (14:18 - 14:21)
raids and stuff (14:20 - 14:24)
oh but the last last bit of news here is (14:21 - 14:27)
the north face and gucci collaboration (14:24 - 14:30)
which we've talked about collaborations (14:27 - 14:31)
before (14:30 - 14:33)
i don't this whole thing is really (14:31 - 14:34)
frustrating (14:33 - 14:38)
not in the sense of i don't really care (14:34 - 14:41)
that much about not who (14:38 - 14:43)
like the collaboration itself doesn't (14:41 - 14:45)
bother me in a sense of like the pokemon (14:43 - 14:47)
company partner with mr donuts (14:45 - 14:49)
in japan for chancy donuts and the (14:47 - 14:51)
pokemon company has partnered with (14:49 - 14:54)
uh long champ or whatever however will (14:51 - 14:54)
says it (14:54 - 14:57)
and those are like designer 800 purses (14:54 - 14:58)
that i will never buy (14:57 - 15:00)
i mean the pokemon company pokemon go (14:58 - 15:01)
niantic whatever (15:00 - 15:02)
they partnered with starbucks i can't (15:01 - 15:04)
even remember last time i went to a (15:02 - 15:05)
starbucks like four years ago (15:04 - 15:08)
where you get your coffee from i don't (15:05 - 15:10)
drink coffee collectivo (15:08 - 15:12)
i don't know who you oh that's true (15:10 - 15:13)
colectivo is pretty good i preferred it (15:12 - 15:16)
when it was alteria (15:13 - 15:19)
more pokemon altaria i'll talk (15:16 - 15:22)
again i can't even remember i could just (15:19 - 15:25)
think alterion (15:22 - 15:27)
that's what it used to be called altera (15:25 - 15:28)
that's what it was (15:27 - 15:32)
uh are you sure i think so (15:28 - 15:34)
it sure is get out the 3ds i'm pretty (15:32 - 15:36)
sure it's atari (15:34 - 15:40)
but they don't have coffee shops (15:36 - 15:43)
here's a list of billboards (15:40 - 15:43)
if i get one more oshawa i'm putting (15:44 - 15:47)
this thing down this (15:45 - 15:50)
collab is just i mean i'm not losing (15:47 - 15:52)
sleep over it it's just no (15:50 - 15:55)
it's just dumb it's dumb okay it's dumb (15:52 - 15:57)
there's a couple there's there's a (15:55 - 15:59)
number of dumb things within this dumb (15:57 - 16:00)
thing that they're doing (15:59 - 16:03)
so it says north face and gucci pokemon (16:00 - 16:05)
go discover hashtag the north face and (16:03 - 16:07)
gucci okay but (16:05 - 16:08)
let's stop right there i'm already (16:07 - 16:10)
getting distracted does (16:08 - 16:12)
gucci own north face or does north face (16:10 - 16:13)
no (16:12 - 16:15)
it's a couple web it's a collab it's a (16:13 - 16:17)
collaboration okay so (16:15 - 16:20)
so there's three collabs here yeah it's (16:17 - 16:24)
a triple this is (16:20 - 16:24)
it's like when girl skateboards collabs (16:27 - 16:30)
with sanrio (16:29 - 16:31)
they don't neither one owns the other (16:30 - 16:33)
but they're just like (16:31 - 16:35)
girl skateboards is using sanrio (16:33 - 16:37)
characters on their skateboards that's (16:35 - 16:37)
it (16:37 - 16:39)
yeah but that's two people this is three (16:37 - 16:41)
people it's just just because they (16:39 - 16:43)
happen to make an appearance in pokemon (16:41 - 16:45)
go doesn't make it three people (16:43 - 16:46)
what if you could get a sanrio girl (16:45 - 16:49)
skateboard in pokemon go (16:46 - 16:50)
it's the same thing okay that's true i (16:49 - 16:53)
see i see gucci and north face (16:50 - 16:56)
did a real like fashion launch (16:53 - 16:58)
like collaboration like those two (16:56 - 17:00)
companies did do a thing (16:58 - 17:02)
yeah you could legit buy these clothes (17:00 - 17:05)
yeah like that's a thing they already (17:02 - 17:06)
like they're not the same company but (17:05 - 17:08)
they did a fashion collab and (17:06 - 17:12)
i would argue that it's ugly but (17:08 - 17:14)
this is just then pokemon saying let's (17:12 - 17:15)
get in on that (17:14 - 17:18)
you already did a thing so let's do (17:15 - 17:19)
another thing with it (17:18 - 17:21)
okay so it says discover north face (17:19 - 17:23)
gucci collection (17:21 - 17:26)
in pokemon go with avatar items designed (17:23 - 17:27)
from the lines of t-shirts hats and (17:26 - 17:28)
backpacks (17:27 - 17:30)
as a gift to the community who may not (17:28 - 17:31)
be experienced this collaboration due to (17:30 - 17:34)
local restrictions you can redeem (17:31 - 17:37)
the avatar code using uh it's okay so (17:34 - 17:38)
it's like a (17:37 - 17:40)
it's like a long code here i'm sure (17:38 - 17:42)
you've probably seen it on social media (17:40 - 17:45)
and then inside your go app before (17:42 - 17:46)
originally (17:45 - 17:48)
they said you can only get this shirt (17:46 - 17:49)
backpack (17:48 - 17:53)
hat by going to a gucci store or a north (17:49 - 17:54)
face store i think (17:53 - 17:56)
there was like a hundred locations you (17:54 - 17:58)
could go through throughout the world (17:56 - 18:00)
and there was like four in california (17:58 - 18:03)
one in seattle like two in new york (18:00 - 18:04)
there was like two in chicago and that (18:03 - 18:06)
was closest to me was chicago (18:04 - 18:07)
i don't know you guys don't have a gucci (18:06 - 18:09)
or no face well we (18:07 - 18:10)
i like i have a northwest store in (18:09 - 18:12)
milwaukee we have a north face store at (18:10 - 18:14)
the mall of america we have one in the (18:12 - 18:15)
mall of america do you know if it (18:14 - 18:16)
changed the gucci one (18:15 - 18:18)
wait how long does this run for cause (18:16 - 18:19)
i'll go down there no you (18:18 - 18:21)
just you can just use the code now you (18:19 - 18:23)
don't have to yeah so like (18:21 - 18:26)
two days after they said 100 pokestops (18:23 - 18:27)
in the world (18:26 - 18:29)
yeah then they just gave a code to (18:27 - 18:31)
everyone because people because people (18:29 - 18:32)
were rightly like (18:31 - 18:35)
why are you making why are you making (18:32 - 18:36)
exclusive things that people have to (18:35 - 18:38)
travel for (18:36 - 18:41)
right now it was not a good look (18:38 - 18:42)
i'm just a little annoyed that it's like (18:41 - 18:45)
literally no pokemon theme to it at (18:42 - 18:48)
all like i understand because face (18:45 - 18:49)
slogan is (18:48 - 18:51)
never stop exploring which kind of goes (18:49 - 18:52)
in line with pokemon go (18:51 - 18:54)
but other outside of that there's (18:52 - 18:55)
nothing (18:54 - 18:57)
yeah so i i follow a lot of people who (18:55 - 18:59)
work at the pokemon company on twitter (18:57 - 19:02)
pokemon company got them north face (18:59 - 19:02)
jackets (19:02 - 19:05)
for their christmas present and i will (19:02 - 19:07)
say north face jackets are really nice (19:05 - 19:09)
yes they are and on the north face (19:07 - 19:11)
jacket was like a little (19:09 - 19:12)
it was really subtle it was just like a (19:11 - 19:14)
it was just like pikachu's head (19:12 - 19:16)
no that i would want it was a really (19:14 - 19:18)
clean looking jacket (19:16 - 19:20)
and so when they announced the gucci (19:18 - 19:23)
pokemon go north face i was like oh (19:20 - 19:24)
like they're probably going to do a (19:23 - 19:27)
couple jackets maybe some gloves (19:24 - 19:29)
but it's just this shirt and this hat (19:27 - 19:30)
and this backpack (19:29 - 19:33)
and they have nothing to do with pokemon (19:30 - 19:34)
yes (19:33 - 19:37)
and they're kind of ugly and i'm sure (19:34 - 19:38)
the backpacks like (19:37 - 19:40)
twenty thousand dollars and the hat is (19:38 - 19:41)
probably like ten thousand dollars and (19:40 - 19:42)
the shirt is probably like eight hundred (19:41 - 19:43)
dollars because (19:42 - 19:44)
gucci's on it (19:43 - 19:46)
[Laughter] (19:44 - 19:48)
i wonder how much they actually are i (19:46 - 19:50)
mean north face isn't cheap (19:48 - 19:53)
on its own yeah i know that's why i was (19:50 - 19:53)
like (19:53 - 19:56)
kind of excited because i don't have an (19:53 - 19:57)
amazing (19:56 - 19:58)
winter jacket and i was like you know (19:57 - 20:01)
what i've heard amazing things about (19:58 - 20:01)
north face (20:01 - 20:03)
i know they're a little bit pricier but (20:01 - 20:06)
if it has a subtle pikachu on it i'm in (20:03 - 20:08)
i'll i'll split i'll treat my i'll treat (20:06 - 20:09)
myself to christmas but they didn't do (20:08 - 20:10)
anything (20:09 - 20:15)
it's just this dumb gucci shirt (20:10 - 20:17)
it's a bit of a bummer yeah at least (20:15 - 20:18)
like the long champ stuff (20:17 - 20:20)
looked cool i know i couldn't afford it (20:18 - 20:23)
nor was i in the market for a purse but (20:20 - 20:24)
at least it was like a really cool (20:23 - 20:26)
looking purse (20:24 - 20:30)
yeah it's it's a weird i don't know it's (20:26 - 20:30)
weird (20:30 - 20:33)
like this one is just there's just (20:30 - 20:34)
nothing pokemon about (20:33 - 20:37)
it and also i think they picked the (20:34 - 20:38)
least attractive (20:37 - 20:41)
options from the collab like there's a (20:38 - 20:42)
cute jacket in there (20:41 - 20:44)
and that's not even an option you just (20:42 - 20:46)
get the weird t-shirt you don't even get (20:44 - 20:47)
the boots (20:46 - 20:50)
and then again before they release the (20:47 - 20:52)
code it was like really this is (20:50 - 20:54)
you're limiting it to the to your stores (20:52 - 20:55)
and you're not even (20:54 - 20:56)
all of your stores because there's a (20:55 - 20:58)
gucci and a north face store in mall of (20:56 - 20:59)
america (20:58 - 21:01)
so i would have had a direct i i (20:59 - 21:04)
considered driving (21:01 - 21:06)
to get these ugly clothes because i just (21:04 - 21:08)
like collecting things in pokemon go (21:06 - 21:10)
so i was like well the nearest store to (21:08 - 21:12)
me is an hour away (21:10 - 21:14)
but that store is like 20 minutes away (21:12 - 21:16)
from a japanese grocery store that (21:14 - 21:19)
i could go to and i would need to stock (21:16 - 21:21)
up (21:19 - 21:22)
but there was the other thing with this (21:21 - 21:24)
event is there's no end date (21:22 - 21:27)
yeah so they didn't say like oh get your (21:24 - 21:28)
gucci stuff (21:27 - 21:31)
by february 7th or something so that was (21:28 - 21:32)
also hard to plan like (21:31 - 21:34)
do i need to go this weekend what if i (21:32 - 21:36)
plan to go in like two weeks is it still (21:34 - 21:38)
going to be available (21:36 - 21:40)
like there's just no details about this (21:38 - 21:42)
event besides like here's some ugly (21:40 - 21:45)
clothes good luck (21:42 - 21:46)
but whatever they made the code (21:45 - 21:48)
available to everyone so and we're (21:46 - 21:49)
talking about gucci and north face right (21:48 - 21:51)
now so i guess it worked in (21:49 - 21:53)
the sense of they wanted us to talk (21:51 - 21:55)
about it i mean at least (21:53 - 21:59)
the release dates for the gucci stuff (21:55 - 22:02)
like the last thing they'll go online on (21:59 - 22:05)
january 22nd so i imagine it's through (22:02 - 22:08)
all of that like it's at least the month (22:05 - 22:10)
of january because that's when they're (22:08 - 22:10)
releasing (22:10 - 22:13)
everything all the actual products that (22:10 - 22:14)
they created (22:13 - 22:19)
there's still no prices that i can see (22:14 - 22:21)
yeah if you need to ask the price buddy (22:19 - 22:22)
you can't afford it well i know but i (22:21 - 22:24)
mean (22:22 - 22:27)
like one of my favorite expressions ever (22:24 - 22:29)
there's no prices on the menu well this (22:27 - 22:30)
isn't the place for you (22:29 - 22:33)
i would think they would at least have (22:30 - 22:35)
something (22:33 - 22:38)
to say this is what you're looking at (22:35 - 22:41)
price wise i mean to be fair looking at (22:38 - 22:43)
their regular things a pair of pants a (22:41 - 22:44)
thousand dollars (22:43 - 22:47)
so we're gonna say that they're they're (22:44 - 22:49)
around the thousand dollar mark (22:47 - 22:52)
i can i can probably honestly say i'm (22:49 - 22:53)
the only person in this conversation (22:52 - 22:54)
that has ever spent (22:53 - 22:56)
over a thousand dollars on a single (22:54 - 22:57)
article of clothing and (22:56 - 22:59)
a thousand dollars for a pair of pants (22:57 - 23:01)
is too much money oh yeah (22:59 - 23:03)
i have never spent that much money on a (23:01 - 23:05)
piece of clothing that i (23:03 - 23:08)
can think of i've come close like for (23:05 - 23:09)
jackets and stuff (23:08 - 23:11)
but never over a thousand dollars the (23:09 - 23:13)
only uh pokemon (23:11 - 23:16)
masters news i got is there is a new (23:13 - 23:19)
login bonus um it looks like just seven (23:16 - 23:20)
days in a row you eventually (23:19 - 23:22)
if you log in all seven days you get 500 (23:20 - 23:24)
gems and then you get 40 skip tickets (23:22 - 23:25)
because (23:24 - 23:28)
we all know that everyone is very low on (23:25 - 23:29)
skip tickets (23:28 - 23:32)
skip ticket poor uh my you'll be happy (23:29 - 23:34)

tcg things just came out there is a (29:30 - 29:35)
pokemon tcg alakazam v box (29:32 - 29:37)
uh that should be available on pokemon (29:35 - 29:39)
center should be available in like (29:37 - 29:41)
target in walmart and other stores (29:39 - 29:45)
is is what you would think but i believe (29:41 - 29:48)
people are still that tcg craze is still (29:45 - 29:48)
going but (29:48 - 29:50)
uh as of as of this recording it's still (29:48 - 29:52)
on pokemon center for 20 bucks and it's (29:50 - 29:53)
free shipping (29:52 - 29:55)
on pokemon center for 20 bucks the (29:53 - 29:58)
alakazam v box includes one promo card (29:55 - 30:00)
featuring alkenzamv one oversized card (29:58 - 30:02)
featuring alakazamv (30:00 - 30:04)
four booster packs and a code card for (30:02 - 30:05)
the online game (30:04 - 30:08)
see how many steam seizures in this box (30:05 - 30:11)
does it include a boss's orders (30:08 - 30:13)
no it's just four booster packs could it (30:11 - 30:15)
include a boss's orders in one of those (30:13 - 30:16)
booster packs (30:15 - 30:21)
boss's orders was rebel clash (30:16 - 30:23)
it looks like there's one rebel clash (30:21 - 30:26)
here i see two vivid voltage (30:23 - 30:28)
one rebel clash i think that's rubble (30:26 - 30:29)
clash in the background (30:28 - 30:32)
that other one might be darkness ablaze (30:29 - 30:33)
if i go to target (30:32 - 30:36)
tonight to get some groceries and they (30:33 - 30:38)
have pokemon packs (30:36 - 30:40)
what should i which pack set should i be (30:38 - 30:41)
looking for (30:40 - 30:43)
where's my what's my money set i would (30:41 - 30:45)
say your money set is vivid voltage (30:43 - 30:47)
right now (30:45 - 30:47)
with the big pica (30:47 - 30:52)
and then the second one i would probably (30:51 - 30:54)
say is darkness ablaze it would probably (30:52 - 30:55)
be an order of release (30:54 - 30:58)
like sword and shield is probably the (30:55 - 31:00)
least exciting (30:58 - 31:02)
of the sword and shield sets so i would (31:00 - 31:03)
probably say (31:02 - 31:06)
first vivid voltage second darkness (31:03 - 31:08)
ablaze third rebel clash (31:06 - 31:11)
fourth sword and shield all right so i'm (31:08 - 31:12)
buying more commander legends that's (31:11 - 31:13)
what (31:12 - 31:15)
that's what i'm hearing here okay unless (31:13 - 31:17)
they have a champion's path (31:15 - 31:20)
which has the two charizards that (31:17 - 31:21)
everyone wants (31:20 - 31:24)
but also champion's path is a scam don't (31:21 - 31:25)
get champion's path (31:24 - 31:28)
there's another tcg thing coming out on (31:25 - 31:30)
this is so the alex exam should already (31:28 - 31:32)
be out it said release date was january (31:30 - 31:32)
8th (31:32 - 31:35)
this is pokemon tcg v battle deck (31:32 - 31:37)
venusaur vs blastoise this comes out on (31:35 - 31:39)
february 5th (31:37 - 31:41)
this comes with two ready to play v (31:39 - 31:44)
battle decks each has 60 cards (31:41 - 31:46)
each deck includes a po a powerful (31:44 - 31:48)
special pokemon either venusaur or (31:46 - 31:50)
blastoise (31:48 - 31:52)
eight additional trainer cards including (31:50 - 31:53)
two foils (31:52 - 31:56)
two large metallic coins two deck boxes (31:53 - 31:58)
two quick start guides two single-player (31:56 - 31:59)
mats (31:58 - 32:01)
six reference cards damage counters one (31:59 - 32:03)
guide to upgrading your deck and a code (32:01 - 32:05)
card for the online game (32:03 - 32:08)
i don't know how good (32:05 - 32:12)
these decks are (32:08 - 32:15)
uh there there is like the adp (32:12 - 32:16)
battle box i think it's called the (32:15 - 32:19)
battle box that you can buy (32:16 - 32:22)
and it gives you like zashian and adp (32:19 - 32:23)
it's actually like (32:22 - 32:25)
close to the final deck that people use (32:23 - 32:27)
at tournaments (32:25 - 32:30)
not 100 sure how well like venusaur (32:27 - 32:33)
and blastoise are not particularly like (32:30 - 32:35)
i wouldn't say they're tournament level (32:33 - 32:40)
at all um there is a little like (32:35 - 32:43)
step counter on this it's one out of (32:40 - 32:45)
three pokeballs and it says level one so (32:43 - 32:46)
i think this is just mostly for (32:45 - 32:47)
beginners (32:46 - 32:49)
i don't know i i don't know what the (32:47 - 32:51)
difference is between getting (32:49 - 32:53)
these two versus getting a theme deck (32:51 - 32:56)
first getting a battle box that's kind (32:53 - 32:58)
of the confusing thing (32:56 - 33:00)
yeah i don't know about the theme deck (32:58 - 33:01)
part but i would say like (33:00 - 33:04)
the the only point of these ones that i (33:01 - 33:04)
could think of (33:04 - 33:06)
is like if greg and i were going to go (33:04 - 33:08)
to brunch and we're like we need (33:06 - 33:09)
something to do (33:08 - 33:10)
while we're at brunch because it takes (33:09 - 33:12)
them a long time to serve the food and (33:10 - 33:13)
we're like well let's grab some pokemon (33:12 - 33:14)
decks (33:13 - 33:16)
and neither one of us plays the tcg so (33:14 - 33:17)
we don't have prepared (33:16 - 33:20)
decks correct so we could just grab one (33:17 - 33:22)
of these not sleeve it (33:20 - 33:26)
a shiver just went down my spine (33:22 - 33:26)
and we could throw it down with some (33:27 - 33:30)
pokemon fun right there well that's what (33:28 - 33:32)
a theme deck is already doing (33:30 - 33:36)
but also right i (33:32 - 33:39)
i i only have to buy one product here (33:36 - 33:42)
and i've got two decks versus buying (33:39 - 33:43)
like (33:42 - 33:45)
trust me parents of the world that out (33:43 - 33:47)
there that have no experience with (33:45 - 33:48)
pokemon they're buying a theme deck (33:47 - 33:50)
bringing it home and wondering why their (33:48 - 33:52)
kid has nothing that they can actually (33:50 - 33:52)
play (33:52 - 33:56)
okay we're correcting for that error (33:52 - 33:57)
ah there's no price on this either uh (33:56 - 33:59)
theme deck is like 14.99 (33:57 - 34:01)
so i i'm gonna guess that this is (33:59 - 34:02)
probably gonna be 25. there you go (34:01 - 34:04)
discount (34:02 - 34:08)
the good news this is off bulba garden (34:04 - 34:09)
bulbapedia used to be on top of news (34:08 - 34:12)
they don't do news as much anymore (34:09 - 34:14)
i think because they like force people (34:12 - 34:16)
to change roles (34:14 - 34:18)
because it's a wiki there's like some (34:16 - 34:19)
weird (34:18 - 34:21)
isn't that like a weird wiki rule like (34:19 - 34:22)
every two years you gotta wrote it (34:21 - 34:23)
rotate out somebody (34:22 - 34:26)
no idea never heard that before in my (34:23 - 34:27)
life (34:26 - 34:29)
but is this the article where pokemon (34:27 - 34:31)
tcg becomes more like yu-gi-oh (34:29 - 34:35)
no are you sure (34:31 - 34:38)
yes maybe i don't know uh this is by (34:35 - 34:40)
archaic we've had archaic on the show (34:38 - 34:40)
before (34:40 - 34:44)
they are the the big the big boss of uh (34:40 - 34:48)
bulba garden singapore police arrest (34:44 - 34:51)
pokemon trading card scammer yeah that's (34:48 - 34:52)
more like yugioh right there (34:51 - 34:54)

26 year old man and a 17 year old female (36:27 - 36:31)

like there's there's i mean the obvious (37:51 - 37:55)

people use crazy people still use (39:28 - 39:32)
craigslist (39:30 - 39:33)
everybody just sells through linkedin (39:32 - 39:37)
now yeah i don't think that's happening (39:33 - 39:37)
i mean linkedin's gonna be used for (39:37 - 39:41)
something my career advancement (39:39 - 39:42)
obviously (39:41 - 39:44)
obviously i think you're probably more (39:42 - 39:46)
likely to buy something used off (39:44 - 39:50)
linkedin than to get a job on linkedin (39:46 - 39:50)
i don't think that's happening i mean (39:51 - 39:57)
ebay still seems to have a lot of things (39:54 - 39:58)
for sale on it (39:57 - 40:00)
yeah no i like ebay i i grew up with (39:58 - 40:02)
ebay though (40:00 - 40:04)
so it's a trusted partner of your life i (40:02 - 40:05)
don't know if i'd (40:04 - 40:08)
trust everything on ebay you can get (40:05 - 40:08)
like (40:08 - 40:10)
all 400 shinies and pokemon sword and (40:08 - 40:12)
shield for a solid like (40:10 - 40:15)
40 on ebay if you're into that (40:12 - 40:18)
go on why are you wasting all this time (40:15 - 40:22)
on twitch where you could just spend 40. (40:18 - 40:22)
i ask myself this all the time i still (40:22 - 40:26)
think ebay is probably one of the best (40:25 - 40:27)
places to go (40:26 - 40:31)
to import like japanese goods (40:27 - 40:33)
i mean you could go to like well i used (40:31 - 40:35)
to use japan stuff (40:33 - 40:38)
but they they like closed because of the (40:35 - 40:40)
pandemic and then they like slowly (40:38 - 40:41)
reopened but they're not (40:40 - 40:43)
stocking new things they're only (40:41 - 40:45)
fulfilling things they had before the (40:43 - 40:47)
pandemic started which is like no one (40:45 - 40:47)
wants (40:47 - 40:50)
that old pokemon stuff we want the new (40:47 - 40:51)
stuff (40:50 - 40:52)
and then i guess you could go to like (40:51 - 40:55)
mecca but man the (40:52 - 40:59)
the amount of what's the word surplus (40:55 - 41:01)
price increase they put on things is (40:59 - 41:02)
unrealistic (41:01 - 41:05)
yeah it feels like sometimes you're (41:02 - 41:06)
paying almost double (41:05 - 41:08)
for an item just for them to ship it (41:06 - 41:10)
through dhl (41:08 - 41:12)
last bit of news here started with an (41:10 - 41:14)
arrest story let's end with an arrest (41:12 - 41:19)
story we started with an arrest story as (41:14 - 41:21)
the yugioh (41:19 - 41:26)
continues man arrested for forging (41:21 - 41:29)
prized popsicle sticks to win pokemon (41:26 - 41:31)
cards in japan (41:29 - 41:32)
this was sent in by brandon from our (41:31 - 41:34)
slack community a (41:32 - 41:36)
man was arrested for wednesday in (41:34 - 41:38)
eastern japan near (41:36 - 41:40)
tokyo for allegedly forging and sending (41:38 - 41:42)
out dozens of special popsicle sticks (41:40 - 41:44)
to an ice cream manufacturer so they (41:42 - 41:47)
could be redeemed for a popular pokemon (41:44 - 41:50)
by four popular pokemon cards by the (41:47 - 41:51)
company (41:50 - 41:54)
the 43 year old man is a suspected for (41:51 - 41:56)
attempting fraud after he sent (41:54 - 41:59)
25 fake popsicle sticks in november (41:56 - 42:03)
la of last year's uh to (41:59 - 42:07)
akagi nayugyo (42:03 - 42:11)
ko in uh satamata prefecture (42:07 - 42:13)
according to local police i'm assuming (42:11 - 42:15)
that is the company that was making the (42:13 - 42:17)
said popsicles i'm sure it's the ice (42:15 - 42:18)
cream (42:17 - 42:21)
the company uh ran a competition between (42:18 - 42:22)
june (42:21 - 42:24)
and july of last year i think we covered (42:22 - 42:26)
this news actually (42:24 - 42:28)
i think so i think so yeah that sounds (42:26 - 42:29)
about right this sounds (42:28 - 42:32)
oddly familiar now the company ran a (42:29 - 42:34)
competition between june and july of (42:32 - 42:35)
last year which people could send in a (42:34 - 42:36)
rare (42:35 - 42:39)
lucky stick from its popular popsicle (42:36 - 42:40)
brand (42:39 - 42:44)
gary gary in exchange for pokemon game (42:40 - 42:46)
cards created for the event the limited (42:44 - 42:48)
sticks were engraved with the words you (42:46 - 42:48)
win (42:48 - 42:51)
a ghari pokemon card which could only be (42:48 - 42:54)
seen after consuming the ice cream (42:51 - 42:58)
uh akari kargi (42:54 - 43:00)
contacted the police after receiving (42:58 - 43:03)
multiple lucky popsicle sticks (43:00 - 43:06)
from what from what was believed to be (43:03 - 43:09)
one person the ice cream manufacturer (43:06 - 43:11)
warned consumers the possibility that (43:09 - 43:13)
fake lucky popsicle sticks are being (43:11 - 43:14)
sold (43:13 - 43:16)
online what does this world come to so (43:14 - 43:18)
this is just like the whole mcdonald's (43:16 - 43:20)
monopoly thing (43:18 - 43:24)
oh yeah oh yeah totally (43:20 - 43:26)
but like didn't wasn't the mcdonald's (43:24 - 43:27)
thing to win a million dollars and not (43:26 - 43:29)
get a bunch of cards (43:27 - 43:31)
hey you find value where you find it (43:29 - 43:33)
true (43:31 - 43:36)
do you think do you think he was he had (43:33 - 43:37)
like one of those wood burner sets that (43:36 - 43:40)
was like individually burning (43:37 - 43:43)
to forge i don't remember what the how (43:40 - 43:44)
the sticks (43:43 - 43:46)
whether it was like ink printed or (43:44 - 43:49)
burned into the popsicle stick (43:46 - 43:50)
but i mean it can't be that hard to (43:49 - 43:52)
forge a popsicle stick (43:50 - 43:54)
if it's ink printed there's your problem (43:52 - 43:56)
right there i mean that's just (43:54 - 43:59)
ripe for counterfeit hello i'm going to (43:56 - 44:01)
go to ebay real quick and see if i can (43:59 - 44:04)
[Laughter] (44:01 - 44:07)
see if i can find fake popsicle sticks (44:04 - 44:10)
no i wanted to see if like somebody won (44:07 - 44:11)
the card (44:10 - 44:14)
and then put it on ebay (44:11 - 44:16)
but it doesn't look like it it doesn't (44:14 - 44:18)
look like it's on ebay (44:16 - 44:20)
i don't know how many winners there were (44:18 - 44:22)
the guy made 25 sticks though (44:20 - 44:24)
that doesn't seem like a lot well if he (44:22 - 44:26)
did more than that it would be (44:24 - 44:28)
suspicious (44:26 - 44:28)
i mean you are at that point playing (44:29 - 44:34)
with they know how many sticks are out (44:32 - 44:35)
in the world (44:34 - 44:38)
and so like if they if they had like (44:35 - 44:39)
there are 12 popsicle sticks and they (44:38 - 44:43)
suddenly got 25. (44:39 - 44:47)
like you're busted at that point (44:43 - 44:48)
what do we have a picture of even what (44:47 - 44:50)
the card was yeah it's just this a root (44:48 - 44:52)
card that is in vivid voltage but (44:50 - 44:53)
there's like a (44:52 - 44:55)
there's like a small gold thing on top (44:53 - 44:56)
of it (44:55 - 45:00)
but it's just as a rude um 210 hp (44:56 - 45:03)
grass pokemon as a rude v card (45:00 - 45:04)
and there's just like a little symbol a (45:03 - 45:06)
gold symbol on it (45:04 - 45:08)
so i'm not sure if that's the final card (45:06 - 45:09)
but that's what's shown in the like what (45:08 - 45:11)
you could win picture (45:09 - 45:15)
um but nobody no one's listing it on (45:11 - 45:16)
ebay (45:15 - 45:18)
so but are anybody listing the popsicle (45:16 - 45:20)

some people don't (49:24 - 49:27)
i don't use top loaders but still back (49:27 - 49:32)
to my initial premise (49:30 - 49:35)
[Laughter] (49:32 - 49:40)
how how much extra money (49:35 - 49:42)
do you need in your life to be willing (49:40 - 49:44)
to spend (49:42 - 49:47)
two thousand dollars on a single trading (49:44 - 49:48)
card that's not even like (49:47 - 49:52)
competitive good well i mean (49:48 - 49:54)
how much is a wood burning set okay this (49:52 - 49:56)
is gonna tell us what the scam was (49:54 - 49:59)
at a certain point money (49:56 - 50:01)
you have too much money will and if i (49:59 - 50:03)
don't don't that sentence has never been (50:01 - 50:04)
spoken (50:03 - 50:07)
i do not have too much money please (50:04 - 50:09)
lawsuit give me more money thank you no (50:07 - 50:11)
i'm saying that like (50:09 - 50:14)
people have people who make (50:11 - 50:17)
people who hit a certain threshold are (50:14 - 50:17)
making sure (50:17 - 50:22)
pay higher taxes oh i'm sorry yes sure (50:17 - 50:24)
but they're making so much money (50:22 - 50:26)
consistently (50:24 - 50:28)
okay and if i if i was at that point in (50:26 - 50:30)
my life which will never happen because (50:28 - 50:31)
i decided to get into both twitch (50:30 - 50:33)
streaming and podcasting two of the (50:31 - 50:33)
least (50:33 - 50:36)
and tick tock and tick tock i've made (50:33 - 50:36)
zero (50:36 - 50:40)
sense um if i was on the (50:36 - 50:42)
other end of things where i had too much (50:40 - 50:43)
money (50:42 - 50:45)
you better believe i would be paying two (50:43 - 50:47)
thousand dollars for uh (50:45 - 50:50)
the rude card stamped with a monkey face (50:47 - 50:51)
golden thing (50:50 - 50:53)
only from japan because i searched ice (50:51 - 50:55)
cream japanese on ebay you better (50:53 - 50:56)
believe i (50:55 - 50:59)
i would be by ebay would be flourishing (50:56 - 51:02)
with money because i would be importing (50:59 - 51:04)
everything i could (51:02 - 51:08)
i would single-handedly keep ebay afloat (51:04 - 51:10)
where are you gonna put all this garbage (51:08 - 51:13)
in here 17 houses i own (51:10 - 51:15)
here it is i found out why this person (51:13 - 51:16)
did this (51:15 - 51:19)
you can buy 200 (51:16 - 51:22)
popsicle sticks for five dollars oh (51:19 - 51:23)
that's true because i could make little (51:22 - 51:25)
log cabins out of my popsicle stick (51:23 - 51:28)
collection and a wood burning (51:25 - 51:31)
kit for fifteen dollars (51:28 - 51:36)
so for twenty dollars you could make (51:31 - 51:39)
two thousand dollars per card on ebay (51:36 - 51:41)
nobody's buying that card for two (51:39 - 51:42)
thousand dollars that's true yeah well (51:41 - 51:44)
then we saw it for sale okay five (51:42 - 51:45)
hundred dollars (51:44 - 51:48)
that's still a lot of profit for (51:45 - 51:50)
very little work okay so greg i must say (51:48 - 51:52)
thank you because i was thinking of (51:50 - 51:53)
getting back into model rockets but now (51:52 - 51:56)
i'm just gonna buy popsicle sticks (51:53 - 51:58)
and go for it yeah okay the real (51:56 - 52:00)
question is how many (51:58 - 52:03)
winners of this ice cream was there (52:00 - 52:05)
because on ebay (52:03 - 52:08)
[Laughter] (52:05 - 52:11)

of the like (52:18 - 52:22)
english japanese words that all (52:20 - 52:24)
americans might know both samurai and (52:22 - 52:25)

they have sold 392 things on ebay they (52:25 - 52:31)
have the little blue star which means (52:28 - 52:34)
99.5 positive feedback whatever (52:31 - 52:36)

certificate the little (52:36 - 52:41)
monkey face stamp 490 this is the one (52:37 - 52:45)
i would probably buy if i had uh if 500 (52:41 - 52:47)
was pocket change to me it's not this is (52:45 - 52:48)
the this is the seller i would probably (52:47 - 52:49)
buy from (52:48 - 52:52)
not only do they have two cards (52:49 - 52:54)
available at 490 (52:52 - 52:58)
90 they have sold seven so far (52:54 - 53:01)
how did did they just like buy cards (52:58 - 53:05)
off other people to like that's possible (53:01 - 53:08)
what what is it a corner of the market (53:05 - 53:08)
yeah (53:08 - 53:15)
how did they get so many they had uh (53:08 - 53:18)
they enjoy (53:15 - 53:22)
they enjoy in as a way of celebration (53:18 - 53:26)
having these wonderful ice cream frozen (53:22 - 53:27)
treats (53:26 - 53:30)
what i don't understand (53:27 - 53:32)
now that you've made me open ebay on my (53:30 - 53:33)
computer and i will (53:32 - 53:35)
literally have to take my computer and (53:33 - 53:36)
throw it into the dumpster (53:35 - 53:39)
because it has been tainted the name of (53:36 - 53:41)
our new podcast what i don't (53:39 - 53:43)
what i understand what i don't (53:41 - 53:45)
understand is (53:43 - 53:48)
why there are also listings for pokemon (53:45 - 53:50)
card gary gary (53:48 - 53:52)
elected the rude i guess i'm that's (53:50 - 53:54)
zarud whatever (53:52 - 53:58)
envelope winning notice (53:54 - 54:02)
so not the actual card (53:58 - 54:02)
not the certificate but the envelope (54:02 - 54:09)
envelope that had the winning notice in (54:06 - 54:09)
it (54:09 - 54:11)
well maybe somebody got the card and (54:09 - 54:13)
they want the they want (54:11 - 54:17)
560 us dollars (54:13 - 54:17)
do you know i could buy a north face (54:19 - 54:24)
jacket for 560 us dollars that would (54:21 - 54:26)
keep me much warmer than this envelope (54:24 - 54:29)
this wasn't this wasn't in our news but (54:26 - 54:30)
there's a um (54:29 - 54:33)
there was a another card that's going (54:30 - 54:35)
for quite a bit not not as much as it's (54:33 - 54:37)
a rude card it's it's a pikachu card (54:35 - 54:39)
um that was exclusive to 7-eleven in (54:37 - 54:40)
japan (54:39 - 54:43)
it's the it's the card that i actually (54:40 - 54:44)
wanted (54:43 - 54:46)
it's the cramer ant with the pikachu in (54:44 - 54:48)
its mouth although it's a pikachu card (54:46 - 54:50)
not a crammer rant card (54:48 - 54:54)
uh and what they did is they (54:50 - 54:58)
made this cramer ant box (54:54 - 55:00)
and they sold it at 7-elevens and the (54:58 - 55:03)
kramer amp box (55:00 - 55:06)
was 4 000 yen which comes to like i (55:03 - 55:07)
don't know like 35 (55:06 - 55:10)
or whatever uh and the box is (55:07 - 55:12)
it's like a it's a promotion for the (55:10 - 55:14)
movie it comes with the pikachu promo it (55:12 - 55:15)
says coco on it (55:14 - 55:19)
koko uh which is funny because sometimes (55:15 - 55:22)
the other promotions say coco and it (55:19 - 55:24)
came with like five booster packs two (55:22 - 55:26)
the booster packs were shiny star v (55:24 - 55:28)
and then to the booster packs were (55:26 - 55:30)
whatever their like version of darkness (55:28 - 55:30)
ablaze is (55:30 - 55:34)
and then it was like an older like uh i (55:30 - 55:35)
think it was ultra shiny (55:34 - 55:38)
though like our hidden fates their their (55:35 - 55:39)
ultra shiny set (55:38 - 55:44)
and that whole box which is like 40 (55:39 - 55:46)
or 4 000 yen in japan is going for like (55:44 - 55:47)
300 (55:46 - 55:51)
on ebay i see one for 500 i see one for (55:47 - 55:52)
360 (55:51 - 55:55)
365. 60. the card is the one i (55:52 - 55:57)
well i do like the box because the box (55:55 - 55:59)
is like pikachu and cramer ants (55:57 - 56:02)
it's like a cool box the card is what i (55:59 - 56:03)
really want (56:02 - 56:04)
but the card itself is going for like (56:03 - 56:07)
150 (56:04 - 56:10)
150 to 200 yeah so i don't know if that (56:07 - 56:11)
card (56:10 - 56:13)
i don't know if that card this is the (56:11 - 56:14)
thing about (56:13 - 56:16)
pokemon cards is that card will stay (56:14 - 56:18)
valuable (56:16 - 56:20)
if they never print it in english but (56:18 - 56:24)
the second they printed in english (56:20 - 56:25)
no one will care about the japanese one (56:24 - 56:27)
anymore they'll want the english one (56:25 - 56:29)
uh i guess people in japan will care (56:27 - 56:30)
about the japanese one (56:29 - 56:33)
that's true yeah nobody (56:30 - 56:36)
listen to you anyways well i'll be (56:33 - 56:37)

not channels (58:01 - 58:04)
dedicated to wood burning that's this is (58:02 - 58:06)
a lie this is a lie you're not you're (58:04 - 58:07)
not searching the right thing (58:06 - 58:09)
just like i had to search japanese ice (58:07 - 58:11)
cream to find the root (58:09 - 58:13)
there are a bunch of people who put up (58:11 - 58:16)
videos of wood burning but not (58:13 - 58:18)
dedic like not a dedicated wood burning (58:16 - 58:19)
channel (58:18 - 58:21)
this is what i want to do because i this (58:19 - 58:22)
is what i've wanted to (58:21 - 58:24)
do but we'll never do so if you want to (58:22 - 58:25)
steal this you're more than welcome to (58:24 - 58:27)
because it'll never but you never do it (58:25 - 58:30)
because i don't have time and bad time (58:27 - 58:31)
i've (58:30 - 58:34)
already it's clearly a passion project (58:31 - 58:36)
i've already have passion products that (58:34 - 58:38)
don't pay the bills like this podcast (58:36 - 58:39)
and like (58:38 - 58:42)
twitch uh everything youtube everything (58:39 - 58:43)
i do (58:42 - 58:44)
already doesn't pay the bills so i don't (58:43 - 58:46)
need to add another thing anyways the (58:44 - 58:47)
thing i would want to do on youtube is a (58:46 - 58:48)
water review (58:47 - 58:51)
channel because no one is reviewing (58:48 - 58:52)
water (58:51 - 58:54)
but why because it's all from the tap no (58:52 - 58:56)
it all tastes different greg (58:54 - 58:59)
decides to taste different than aquafan (58:56 - 59:00)
tastes different than (58:59 - 59:03)
uh the smart water tastes different than (59:00 - 59:03)
core (59:03 - 59:06)
tasting this is this is the wine tasting (59:03 - 59:07)
fallacy (59:06 - 59:10)
you have believe that you taste things (59:07 - 59:11)
different (59:10 - 59:13)
exactly brought you five glasses of (59:11 - 59:14)
water unmarked (59:13 - 59:16)
and placed them in front of you and said (59:14 - 59:17)
point out which is which (59:16 - 59:21)
you would have no idea no way i would (59:17 - 59:24)
literally be able to tell which one is (59:21 - 59:24)
fiji (59:24 - 59:27)
which one is smart which one is dasani i (59:24 - 59:28)
eat (59:27 - 59:31)
easy it's all it's all a boot point (59:28 - 59:32)
because i have watched (59:31 - 59:34)
youtube videos of people drinking (59:32 - 59:36)
different waters and reviewing them (59:34 - 59:40)
so that's not true you're telling me my (59:36 - 59:43)
eyes have deceived me (59:40 - 59:43)
that annoying mother with her two (59:44 - 59:47)
children who was like (59:46 - 59:49)
absolutely convinced that if your water (59:47 - 59:51)
that you're drinking doesn't have the (59:49 - 59:53)
right ph balance it's going to destroy (59:51 - 59:55)
your innards (59:53 - 59:56)
that that was that was fully my (59:55 - 59:58)
imagination (59:56 - 60:00)
sounds like it yeah here's the important (59:58 - 60:03)
thing if anyone out there (60:00 - 60:06)
wants the will and greg (60:03 - 60:08)
minnesota log cabin christmas village (60:06 - 60:09)
2021 (60:08 - 60:12)
put in your orders now because it takes (60:09 - 60:14)
a long time (60:12 - 60:17)
[Laughter] (60:14 - 60:19)
when you are finally fully living in (60:17 - 60:20)
this state (60:19 - 60:23)
steve i we are going to sit down (60:20 - 60:26)
and record this masterful water tasting (60:23 - 60:27)
thing (60:26 - 60:29)
we are going to do it and you're going (60:27 - 60:30)
to fail (60:29 - 60:33)
here's the secret and and greg i will go (60:30 - 60:35)
back to your wine tasting dealio (60:33 - 60:38)
the secret with all of this nonsense and (60:35 - 60:40)
it applies to coffee as well (60:38 - 60:44)
where they're like it has uh tones (60:40 - 60:47)
of nougat and elderberry sap (60:44 - 60:51)
and maple droppings they they only refer (60:47 - 60:53)
to things that nobody has ever tasted so (60:51 - 60:55)
you're not sure whether you actually (60:53 - 60:56)
taste it or not and you feel like a fool (60:55 - 60:57)
if you ask (60:56 - 61:00)
look i'm not i'm not i distinctly taste (60:57 - 61:02)
maple droppings in this water (61:00 - 61:04)
this is from the north this is clearly (61:02 - 61:07)
from the northern part of the americas (61:04 - 61:09)
where maple squirrels went free and the (61:07 - 61:11)
droppings go into these (61:09 - 61:14)
fresh streams i can tell after it's been (61:11 - 61:15)
sifted and (61:14 - 61:17)
strained and placed upon this bottle (61:15 - 61:19)
that yes this water is surely a (61:17 - 61:21)
vermont's finest (61:19 - 61:24)
naive water yes surely (61:21 - 61:27)
i'm not sipping on dasani being like yes (61:24 - 61:29)
i can i can't taste it (61:27 - 61:32)
don't you ever said you could taste yeah (61:29 - 61:34)
each one of them and tell them apart (61:32 - 61:36)
yeah i can't go back here's what you (61:34 - 61:38)
need to learn here's what you need to (61:36 - 61:39)
prepare yourself is (61:38 - 61:42)
don't ever drink water out of uh any (61:39 - 61:44)
water bottle that is clear you have to (61:42 - 61:46)
get the blue water bottles (61:44 - 61:49)
because the uh it filters out the blue (61:46 - 61:50)
light (61:49 - 61:52)
and then that breaks down the tubulars (61:50 - 61:53)
in the water which just ruins the flavor (61:52 - 61:55)
if you don't have those two blurs in (61:53 - 61:55)
there (61:55 - 61:59)
there's a hawaii water that is so good (61:55 - 62:00)
i can't remember what the company's (61:59 - 62:03)
called it might start with an h (62:00 - 62:05)
i think you know i do i get it a lot is (62:03 - 62:06)
that (62:05 - 62:09)
it's either uh i think it's kailua water (62:06 - 62:11)
maybe something like that that's not an (62:09 - 62:14)
h whenever i see it at central market (62:11 - 62:15)
it's in a blue bottle though it (62:14 - 62:16)
legitimately doesn't move you got it (62:15 - 62:17)
because you can't get you don't want (62:16 - 62:19)
those tuplers to break down correct (62:17 - 62:23)
i'm doing a search for blue hawaii (62:19 - 62:26)
and are you searching on ebay or (62:23 - 62:28)
i'm sure should i google there's a lot (62:26 - 62:29)
of ca oh i didn't know that was a kind (62:28 - 62:31)
of why ikea (62:29 - 62:33)
yeah yeah that's it that's a that's it (62:31 - 62:36)
it's like volcanic water (62:33 - 62:38)
it's a meaningless statement sir (62:36 - 62:40)
volcanoes are rock (62:38 - 62:42)
you are not drinking molten water no no (62:40 - 62:43)
no like okay (62:42 - 62:46)
fundamentals of earth science the (62:43 - 62:47)
entirety (62:46 - 62:51)
of the hawaiian islands is volcano (62:47 - 62:54)
there are volcanoes everywhere there's a (62:51 - 62:55)
volcano (62:54 - 62:58)
under yosemite park but not even that (62:55 - 62:59)
just like (62:58 - 63:00)
if you're getting water from hawaii it (62:59 - 63:02)
falls from the sky (63:00 - 63:03)
yes it goes to the soil where you're not (63:02 - 63:05)
getting it and then it filters through (63:03 - 63:08)
the volcanic rock that those islands are (63:05 - 63:11)
and then you get it into the aquifer (63:08 - 63:14)
it's all volcanic water (63:11 - 63:16)
that's the only kind of water hawaii (63:14 - 63:18)
knows how to make (63:16 - 63:18)
i'm not recovering from this (63:19 - 63:23)
start with the tublers don't let your (63:27 - 63:31)
tubelers break down (63:29 - 63:34)
don't because that's gonna really affect (63:31 - 63:37)
the maple drops (63:34 - 63:40)
you you will you will not have that (63:37 - 63:46)
aftertaste of fermented nougat if you're (63:40 - 63:48)
nougat really needs to bind to tubulars (63:46 - 63:49)
to really come (63:48 - 63:53)
to really be maple forward in your water (63:49 - 63:56)
it really goes to bind to those because (63:53 - 63:58)
our tongues are designed sp there's like (63:56 - 64:00)
a sixth one further back that's the (63:58 - 64:02)
tubular sentence (64:00 - 64:03)
scientists just discovered the tubular (64:02 - 64:06)
it's just right right there behind you (64:03 - 64:06)
mommy (64:06 - 64:08)
yes so when you're drinking water you (64:06 - 64:09)
need to hold it way back (64:08 - 64:12)
in your throat to really taste it (64:09 - 64:13)
bunching garbage (64:12 - 64:16)
tell water apart because my taste buds (64:13 - 64:18)
are more sophisticated (64:16 - 64:21)
you eat mcdonald's every day (64:18 - 64:24)
your taste buds are dead it keeps it it (64:21 - 64:27)
keeps my tongue at a a uh (64:24 - 64:30)
always ready to taste palette (64:27 - 64:34)
no it's like all i eat your taste buds (64:30 - 64:37)
10 years ago said all we get is mush we (64:34 - 64:39)
might as well die (64:37 - 64:42)
we give up we give up we're never going (64:39 - 64:43)
to get anything (64:42 - 64:47)
tasty so we're done salt you're up (64:43 - 64:48)
because that's all (64:47 - 64:49)
all we're going to get for the rest of (64:48 - 64:51)
our lives i love salt burgers (64:49 - 64:53)
see you go i'm going to lace all your (64:51 - 64:54)
water with (64:53 - 64:56)
salt on the tasting all right great give (64:54 - 64:58)

have you redeemed them all from your (66:06 - 66:10)
delivery man have you used them in your (66:08 - 66:11)
playthroughs or competitive are they (66:10 - 66:13)
still in your old games collecting dust (66:11 - 66:14)
or are there in your newer games or (66:13 - 66:16)
pokemon home looking forward to many (66:14 - 66:17)
events in 2021 (66:16 - 66:21)
i've only found one cartridge where i (66:17 - 66:22)
thought i had redeemed everything and (66:21 - 66:24)
hadn't and i've dumped (66:22 - 66:28)
all of them into bank slash home (66:24 - 66:30)
they aren't organized in any way they're (66:28 - 66:31)
just in there i mean (66:30 - 66:33)
same here collect toss it in the box and (66:31 - 66:35)
move on with my life (66:33 - 66:39)
there's only one person steve who (66:35 - 66:42)
creates special boxes to put them in (66:39 - 66:43)
yeah because my pokemon home is (66:42 - 66:45)
incredibly organized (66:43 - 66:46)
i'm still trying to figure out the point (66:45 - 66:49)
of that because it kind of just like (66:46 - 66:51)
organizes it on its own it's kind of (66:49 - 66:52)
like you like (66:51 - 66:54)
the whole google mentality of like don't (66:52 - 66:56)
organize anything because search will (66:54 - 66:57)
find it for you (66:56 - 67:00)
yeah i just um (66:57 - 67:02)
them in there i mean to be fair i (67:00 - 67:05)
generally collect them (67:02 - 67:07)
all in like when i put them in a box i (67:05 - 67:08)
usually put them in (67:07 - 67:10)
whatever game i got them in in the same (67:08 - 67:12)
box because that's the box that was open (67:10 - 67:14)
and then when i dump them into home and (67:12 - 67:16)
bank they're all (67:14 - 67:18)
clumped together but i've done no (67:16 - 67:20)
organization past that and i don't (67:18 - 67:22)
almost all the distributions have always (67:20 - 67:24)
come after i finished the game so i've (67:22 - 67:25)
never used them (67:24 - 67:28)
in a playthrough i've used so there was (67:25 - 67:29)
the (67:28 - 67:32)
the 2021 or sorry the 2016 pokemon the (67:29 - 67:34)
like year of (67:32 - 67:36)
what was that year of no 2018 was a year (67:34 - 67:37)
of legendary (67:36 - 67:41)
and then 2016 was year of mythical (67:37 - 67:44)
i have used the marsh shadow that was (67:41 - 67:45)
given out (67:44 - 67:47)
in oh yeah wasn't that good against it (67:45 - 67:49)
was good against mewtwo (67:47 - 67:51)
in sword and yeah yeah i used mine (67:49 - 67:52)
too for that one yeah so (67:51 - 67:54)
i busted i used my marshall there there (67:52 - 67:56)
was a there was like a one-off (67:54 - 67:58)
halloween event or something in (67:56 - 68:00)
ultrasound ultra moon where i think you (67:58 - 68:01)
could use marshadow (68:00 - 68:04)
because it was part of the spooky um so (68:01 - 68:05)
i used my marsh shadow there (68:04 - 68:07)
my marshall probably is like the one (68:05 - 68:09)
mythical that got the most (68:07 - 68:13)
used uh with the year of legendary stuff (68:09 - 68:15)
a lot of those legendaries for (68:13 - 68:18)
competitive and ultra sun ultra moon (68:15 - 68:21)
for the ultra cup um what is what is the (68:18 - 68:22)
oldest (68:21 - 68:25)
you have i think my oldest is 2012 (68:22 - 68:30)
mew from heart gold soul silver (68:25 - 68:32)
distribution is probably the oldest (68:30 - 68:34)
pokemon i have (68:32 - 68:37)
oh i i have no idea i don't know i mean (68:34 - 68:39)
i i went to all the mall tours (68:37 - 68:41)
maybe it's two 2010 throughout the (68:39 - 68:43)
beginning ones so i've (68:41 - 68:45)
collected a bunch i don't remember what (68:43 - 68:46)
was given at mall tour so i couldn't (68:45 - 68:49)
i'd have to look them up i have to go to (68:46 - 68:50)
syribi (68:49 - 68:51)
there were some i missed like i missed (68:50 - 68:53)
the mcdonald's hoopa but (68:51 - 68:55)
uh rochelle and are slack she was able (68:53 - 68:58)
to get me one because i missed that one (68:55 - 69:01)
um how did you miss that one of all (68:58 - 69:03)
with your mcdonald's fetish i think it (69:01 - 69:06)
was bk lounging that year (69:03 - 69:07)
i might have switched to burger king for (69:06 - 69:09)
that year that's true i think the one (69:07 - 69:10)
time i did try to (69:09 - 69:13)
go their wi-fi the one i went to the (69:10 - 69:14)
wi-fi (69:13 - 69:16)
didn't actually work or connect so i was (69:14 - 69:17)
like oh (69:16 - 69:20)
i'll just do it again and then i forgot (69:17 - 69:22)
when i went to the wi-fi was (69:20 - 69:24)
not great but i did do it in all four (69:22 - 69:26)
games i'm pretty sure (69:24 - 69:28)
sitting in the parking lot with my (69:26 - 69:29)
lights off like nobody look at me (69:28 - 69:30)
because i'm outside of a (69:29 - 69:32)
mcdonald's oh that was like me and (69:30 - 69:33)
gamestop but (69:32 - 69:36)
for me like the premise of this question (69:33 - 69:36)
is (69:36 - 69:39)
is just fundamentally flawed as it (69:36 - 69:41)
applies to my life because (69:39 - 69:43)
if i'm playing a pokemon game to play (69:41 - 69:45)
the game i'm not using mythicals or (69:43 - 69:47)
legendaries i'm not using anything that (69:45 - 69:49)
would have been a distribution (69:47 - 69:52)
if i'm playing competitive i i don't (69:49 - 69:53)
soft reset (69:52 - 69:55)
for competitive mythicals or legendaries (69:53 - 69:58)
i just borrow them from friends who (69:55 - 70:01)
did that i got a lot of water to taste (69:58 - 70:02)
in my life (70:01 - 70:04)
[Laughter] (70:02 - 70:06)
i don't have time to be soft resetting (70:04 - 70:08)
for distribution pokemon so i just (70:06 - 70:09)
borrow from somebody else (70:08 - 70:11)
so yeah my mythicals and legendaries (70:09 - 70:13)
from distributions go in a box (70:11 - 70:16)
never to be seen again i will sell them (70:13 - 70:18)
on ebay as part of my retirement (70:16 - 70:20)
they mean they're in my will so (70:18 - 70:22)
somebody's gonna be real nice to me and (70:20 - 70:24)
i'll i'll i'll give you the codes to all (70:22 - 70:26)
my pokemon that i've collected over my (70:24 - 70:26)
years (70:26 - 70:28)
yeah i would say most of my pokemon are (70:26 - 70:29)
in pokemon home i have a couple that are (70:28 - 70:30)
not like i (70:29 - 70:34)
i have uh i have like a celebi and a (70:30 - 70:37)
caldeo still in in black and white that (70:34 - 70:37)
i haven't moved (70:37 - 70:39)
but you're still using aren't you still (70:37 - 70:42)
using some back in those games for (70:39 - 70:43)
stuff yeah i'm still i'm still using (70:42 - 70:45)
them eventually they'll get moved up (70:43 - 70:47)
yeah i have to move i have so many (70:45 - 70:48)
things i got to move out of bank i just (70:47 - 70:50)
sort of got distracted (70:48 - 70:53)
as usual well what is our point oh we (70:50 - 70:54)
need to we need to (70:53 - 70:56)
just as a quick side note if a (70:54 - 70:57)
pseudo-odo falls but nobody around to (70:56 - 70:59)
hear it doesn't make a sound (70:57 - 71:02)
yes it will always make a sound our (70:59 - 71:06)
individual experiences don't change how (71:02 - 71:07)
the world works (71:06 - 71:09)
we need to get away from this individual (71:07 - 71:10)
bias nonsense (71:09 - 71:13)
things happen without you being there to (71:10 - 71:14)
witness them (71:13 - 71:17)
yes somebody's still making many people (71:14 - 71:18)
out of popsicle (71:17 - 71:20)
zeros yeah and you didn't hear about it (71:18 - 71:22)
until about 20 minutes ago (71:20 - 71:25)
but it still happened okay (71:22 - 71:27)
pokemon the week i was trying to buy (71:25 - 71:28)
time to find my notes but i literally (71:27 - 71:29)
broke nothing down (71:28 - 71:33)
well okay so i've got a lot of issues (71:29 - 71:35)
well we know but the responses i've (71:33 - 71:38)
received to this past week's pokemon of (71:35 - 71:38)
the week (71:38 - 71:41)
first off the first clue if you can (71:38 - 71:42)
remember my third wife's name this (71:41 - 71:44)
week's pokemon will be an easy guess for (71:42 - 71:45)
you (71:44 - 71:47)
what (71:45 - 71:47)
i i live in the united states (71:48 - 71:54)
in the late 20th century i realized (71:52 - 71:57)
there's a lot of wild stuff going on (71:54 - 72:00)
but what do you think my third wife's (71:57 - 72:00)
name (72:00 - 72:03)
would be that would be similar to lou (72:00 - 72:04)
naton (72:03 - 72:07)
or lou nala i mean i guess (72:04 - 72:09)
i guess i know a guy who's dating a girl (72:07 - 72:12)
named louisa and he calls her lou but (72:09 - 72:15)
come on are you (72:12 - 72:17)
serious when the third one is just like (72:15 - 72:18)
so much clearer (72:17 - 72:22)
you were clearly married to other (72:18 - 72:22)
is like please like if you don't (72:27 - 72:31)
understand a word that i say (72:29 - 72:32)
feel free to look it up in the (72:31 - 72:35)
dictionary because i said that it does (72:32 - 72:36)
not (72:35 - 72:38)
represent a diurnal cycle and guess what (72:36 - 72:40)
diurnal means day and night (72:38 - 72:43)
so if you're looking at lunatone and (72:40 - 72:44)
soul rock (72:43 - 72:46)
day and night if you're looking at new (72:44 - 72:48)
la luna (72:46 - 72:53)
luna day and night that's a no-no (72:48 - 72:55)
we're looking at something that's not (72:53 - 72:57)
day and night and then (72:55 - 73:00)
uh yeah i mean the other part people (72:57 - 73:02)
guessed all three but they just never (73:00 - 73:04)
picked out the right one but here's the (73:02 - 73:05)
other part (73:04 - 73:07)
that there are three pokemon that (73:05 - 73:09)
represent pretty much the same thing (73:07 - 73:11)
two of them are legendary and one is (73:09 - 73:12)
ordinary (73:11 - 73:15)
what do you got greg because i i know (73:12 - 73:17)
steve's (73:15 - 73:20)
researching water brands (73:17 - 73:20)
i have nothing my my my page is blank (73:20 - 73:27)
if i told you that my third wife's name (73:24 - 73:29)
was chris lee anderson (73:27 - 73:33)
and lee was spelled l-e-a lithia (73:29 - 73:35)
wow (73:33 - 73:35)
can't is that right (73:36 - 73:40)
[Music] (73:38 - 73:43)
[Laughter] (73:40 - 73:47)
it's cresselia (73:43 - 73:51)
it was worth it though (73:47 - 73:51)
[Laughter] (73:53 - 73:59)
christelia and darkrai are (73:56 - 74:03)
like quarter moon and new moon or no (73:59 - 74:04)
moon (74:03 - 74:06)
but when you think of chris sometimes (74:04 - 74:08)
you think of like day and night when you (74:06 - 74:09)
think of cresselia because it's the (74:08 - 74:10)
whole (74:09 - 74:12)
moon thing but it's not day and night (74:10 - 74:13)
when it's with darkrai (74:12 - 74:16)
sorry folks (74:13 - 74:16)
just like i was like seriously somebody (74:17 - 74:20)
was like oh it's lunatone i was like (74:19 - 74:22)
what do you think my wife's name (74:20 - 74:26)
that is similar to lunatone (74:22 - 74:26)
and i was like yes her name was lou (74:26 - 74:30)
naton (74:29 - 74:34)
yes uh louise natalie from south (74:30 - 74:37)
could have been natalie louise no i like (74:34 - 74:40)
how their trivia is prior to generation (74:37 - 74:44)
uh six christilia shape was an ant (74:40 - 74:47)
thanks yeah chris ellie is a weird like (74:44 - 74:49)
corocellia (74:47 - 74:52)
dar cry relationship's weird cursely is (74:49 - 74:53)
also 100 (74:52 - 74:55)
female well it's supposed to represent (74:53 - 74:56)
the lunar cycle (74:55 - 74:59)
but what's weird to me is just like and (74:56 - 75:00)
i also mentioned this in the clue (74:59 - 75:03)
is that cresselia is not the full moon (75:00 - 75:04)
she's a crescent moon or (75:03 - 75:08)
it's a crescent moon shuffle icon is (75:04 - 75:10)
very good shiny is decent i kind of like (75:08 - 75:12)
the shiny (75:10 - 75:15)
this is a noticeable shiny although the (75:12 - 75:17)
colors again change it gets lighter (75:15 - 75:20)
as we get later in the games it's (75:17 - 75:22)
another one that sort of had its colors (75:20 - 75:22)
changed (75:22 - 75:24)
i just think the 3ds didn't have that (75:22 - 75:25)
many colors to it because like if you (75:24 - 75:27)
look at chinese and let's go or (75:25 - 75:30)
certain shield they're better like (75:27 - 75:32)
everything in the 3ds just seems very (75:30 - 75:36)
muted and soft that's probably the 3d (75:32 - 75:37)
part of it (75:36 - 75:39)
which nobody uses all right well i (75:37 - 75:42)
turned that off hurt my eyes immediately (75:39 - 75:46)
i was like i can't see i'm old here we (75:42 - 75:48)
go this week's pokemon of the week (75:46 - 75:50)
get ready greg because i know this one's (75:48 - 75:52)
gonna hit you hard okay (75:50 - 75:54)
i received a complaint in the past week (75:52 - 75:56)
about the way that i pronounced the name (75:54 - 75:57)
of a certain pokemon (75:56 - 76:00)
the companion to unovas throw i was so (75:57 - 76:02)
concerned by this complaint that i asked (76:00 - 76:05)
people from my hometown if they also get (76:02 - 76:06)
called out for the way that they (76:05 - 76:07)
pronounce certain words (76:06 - 76:10)
and they all confirmed that they do this (76:07 - 76:13)
week's pokemon is not that pokemon (76:10 - 76:16)
although they share one of its types now (76:13 - 76:18)
if you have really been paying attention (76:16 - 76:21)
you will remember a bit of trivia i (76:18 - 76:23)
brought up about naming conventions for (76:21 - 76:24)
birds (76:23 - 76:26)
where one word is used for a certain (76:24 - 76:28)
class of birds in north america (76:26 - 76:30)
but that same word is used for a (76:28 - 76:32)
different class of birds in the rest of (76:30 - 76:34)
the world (76:32 - 76:36)
my accent also kicks in when i pronounce (76:34 - 76:39)
the rest of the world class of birds (76:36 - 76:41)
it rhymes with throws partner this (76:39 - 76:43)
week's pokemon is based on that type of (76:41 - 76:45)
bird (76:43 - 76:46)
the last thing you need to know to get (76:45 - 76:48)
this week's pokemon is the classic (76:46 - 76:52)
but now defunct team up of enzo amore (76:48 - 76:55)
and big cass their moniker was an homage (76:52 - 76:56)
to the way that i pronounce (76:55 - 76:58)
another word and they come from the (76:56 - 77:01)
world this pokemon is themed after (76:58 - 77:03)
that is not enough information for you (77:01 - 77:05)
please know that i once had an awesome (77:03 - 77:08)
dog that tossed chocolate sauce (77:05 - 77:10)
there you go (77:08 - 77:10)
and we can't we can when i'm around you (77:13 - 77:18)
and i fall into your accent you get (77:15 - 77:20)
mad at me no it's when people repeat (77:18 - 77:21)
words (77:20 - 77:24)
immediately after i say them that make (77:21 - 77:25)
me self-conscious (77:24 - 77:28)
but you say them so good yeah i always (77:25 - 77:29)
get that excuse (77:28 - 77:32)
oh it makes me so happy it does like we (77:29 - 77:34)
all we have here is the fact that we say (77:32 - 77:36)
beer with the hardest r that has ever (77:34 - 77:37)
happened (77:36 - 77:40)
uh and the and then i would try to semi (77:37 - 77:41)
through (77:40 - 77:44)
exactly i was like i would direct you to (77:41 - 77:46)
uh steve's wife (77:44 - 77:50)
because she's got the worst accent (77:46 - 77:53)
of anyone that those those good old (77:50 - 77:55)
