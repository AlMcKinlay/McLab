[Music] (0:01 - 0:29)
what's up everyone welcome to the 414 (0:26 - 0:32)
episode of the Pokemon podcast it's (0:29 - 0:34)
super effective (0:32 - 0:37)
first podcast after the first ever (0:34 - 0:47)
Pokemon DLC so strap on in no strap so (0:37 - 0:50)
we'll in the passenger seat here oh (0:47 - 0:52)
thank goodness I'm in the passenger seat (0:50 - 0:54)
because I took a spill on my bike (0:52 - 0:59)
yesterday and I'm 50% road rash right (0:54 - 1:02)
hobby is going to kill you yes that was (0:59 - 1:05)
the intent okay I got Greg in the (1:02 - 1:09)
backseat yellow this is how it's gonna (1:05 - 1:14)
go and it's gonna go before I unreal (1:09 - 1:17)
this sucker oh it's like how you said (1:14 - 1:19)
how it's gonna go cuz it never goes that (1:17 - 1:23)
way we are going to talk about the (1:19 - 1:26)
Pokemon news that happened the (1:23 - 1:28)
announcement before the DLC came out as (1:26 - 1:32)
as kind of speculated last week the DLC (1:28 - 1:33)
did not arrive at midnight it arrived (1:32 - 1:37)
after the announcement that they planned (1:33 - 1:39)
and after the Pokemon hill maintenance (1:37 - 1:41)
so that seemed to line up pretty pretty (1:39 - 1:43)
okay so I guess for the next DLC for (1:41 - 1:46)
probably the same thing I guess I mean (1:43 - 1:48)
Japan at night America in the morning (1:46 - 1:52)
and New Zealand waiting the next day I (1:48 - 1:54)
guess Rick probably what it's gonna be (1:52 - 1:56)
so we're gonna talk about the (1:54 - 1:58)
announcement stuff then we'll go to (1:56 - 1:59)
break then we're gonna talk all about (1:58 - 2:02)
our thoughts of the DLC now the story (1:59 - 2:05)
isn't particularly long we speculated (2:02 - 2:06)
probably two to three hours which it (2:05 - 2:08)
ended up being I think unless you (2:06 - 2:11)
literally didn't get distracted by any (2:08 - 2:13)
other of the new stuff and you just did (2:11 - 2:14)
the story I'm sure you could probably do (2:13 - 2:16)
it way way quicker but I guess we'll (2:14 - 2:18)
talk about that when we get there so if (2:16 - 2:20)
you're worried about story stuff we will (2:18 - 2:22)
talk about that next week again I don't (2:20 - 2:24)
think I feel like if you don't buy the (2:22 - 2:26)
DLC in the first two weeks and you don't (2:24 - 2:28)
complete the two to three hour story in (2:26 - 2:29)
the first two weeks maybe you don't care (2:28 - 2:34)
that it's super short (2:29 - 2:36)
this is a point that will come up later (2:34 - 2:39)
yeah but we will talk about things that (2:36 - 2:42)
unlock mechanics that might but that (2:39 - 2:44)
might push you to finish the story and I (2:42 - 2:45)
don't really think those are too (2:44 - 2:47)
spoilery but that that's just the show I (2:45 - 2:49)
mean it's it's it's hard because half (2:47 - 2:51)
our audience probably doesn't want (2:49 - 2:53)
spoiler and the other half wants to hear (2:51 - 2:54)
our thoughts on literally every single (2:53 - 2:56)
thing so there's this weird balance we (2:54 - 2:58)
have to do let's just get right into (2:56 - 3:00)
things (2:58 - 3:02)
there was an 11 minute announcement on (3:00 - 3:04)
Wednesday before the DLC dropped and the (3:02 - 3:08)
first thing they opened with was Pokemon (3:04 - 3:13)
not sleep let's smile nah Pokemon smile (3:08 - 3:17)
a thing I can't use you don't smile you (3:13 - 3:19)
don't brush your teeth okay I have an (3:17 - 3:22)
electric toothbrush huh and if I have my (3:19 - 3:25)
mouth open toothpaste lies everywhere (3:22 - 3:28)
yes so no teeth in the shower I won not (3:25 - 3:30)
bringing my phone in the shower for one (3:28 - 3:35)
smile either I'm not gonna bring my mini (3:30 - 3:37)
computer into the shower so that I can (3:35 - 3:39)
spray toothpaste all over it with my (3:37 - 3:40)
electric toothbrush that already (3:39 - 3:43)
measures two minutes yeah I mean this is (3:40 - 3:44)
my problem too I brush my teeth in the (3:43 - 3:46)
shower and I don't want to bring my (3:44 - 3:47)
phone in the shower just to get a (3:46 - 3:49)
picture of a Pokemon but you might be (3:47 - 3:52)
wondering what Pokemon smile is and why (3:49 - 3:54)
there is an official website smile a (3:52 - 3:57)
Pokemon calm motivating children to (3:54 - 4:00)
brush their teeth can be tough but with (3:57 - 4:02)
this clever app brushing becomes an (4:00 - 4:04)
exciting adventure by using your smart (4:02 - 4:06)
devices camera to play the game (4:04 - 4:08)
children can brush their teeth to rescue (4:06 - 4:10)
Pokemon that have been captured by (4:08 - 4:13)
cavity-causing bacteria children will be (4:10 - 4:15)
excited to save their Pokemon friends it (4:13 - 4:17)
is a freedom at this it's it's a (4:15 - 4:19)
literally a free app not a free to start (4:17 - 4:21)
not a free to play there is nothing (4:19 - 4:23)
there's no purchases there's no scam (4:21 - 4:27)
here there's no app it's just yet free (4:23 - 4:29)
because this is specifically a (4:27 - 4:33)
children's app I have talked to a (4:29 - 4:36)
various amount of parents and those (4:33 - 4:39)
parents have said that their small (4:36 - 4:41)
children are completely in love with (4:39 - 4:42)
this app (4:41 - 4:45)
I can't get art here super cute I can't (4:42 - 4:46)
really give you my thoughts of it (4:45 - 4:48)
because I haven't used it yet I have (4:46 - 4:50)
downloaded it but I think you can catch (4:48 - 4:52)
pokemon in it and stuff when you're (4:50 - 4:54)
finished brushing your teeth and I'm (4:52 - 4:56)
pretty sure there's a four-hour cooldown (4:54 - 4:59)
in the app so you can't just like keep (4:56 - 5:01)
brushing keep brushing to unlocking (4:59 - 5:03)
Russian wear down your teeth to catch (5:01 - 5:06)
that Diglett oh yes please remember to (5:03 - 5:08)
use a medium or soft toothbrush please (5:06 - 5:11)
thank you do they even make hard (5:08 - 5:14)
toothbrushes oh yes (5:11 - 5:14)
dentures yeah switching from medium (5:15 - 5:20)
Assaf was probably the best life (5:18 - 5:22)
decision I've made in the last five (5:20 - 5:25)
years from medium to soft from medium to (5:22 - 5:27)
soft okay but yeah I can't use this (5:25 - 5:30)
because many reasons but I think the art (5:27 - 5:32)
is super cute I've seen people take (5:30 - 5:35)
pictures of it and put it on the (5:32 - 5:37)
Twitter's which is also very cute yeah (5:35 - 5:38)
it's a cute idea (5:37 - 5:41)
wait a branch out they got a Pokemon (5:38 - 5:43)
still working and dominate the lifecycle (5:41 - 5:48)
of you waking up thinking about going to (5:43 - 5:50)
bed thinking about Pokemon but clearly (5:48 - 5:52)
not while you're sleeping they announced (5:50 - 5:56)
another new game called Pokemon cafe mix (5:52 - 5:59)
in this announcement cafe mix pokemon (5:56 - 6:02)
calm it will actually be out in about a (5:59 - 6:05)
week I think it comes out on the 27th so (6:02 - 6:09)
relatively soon oddly enough that they (6:05 - 6:12)
announced two games last year that are (6:09 - 6:14)
still not out yet but this game comes (6:12 - 6:20)
out in a week it's coming to the eShop (6:14 - 6:22)
Nintendo eShop the Apple App Store and (6:20 - 6:25)
Google Play Pokemon cafe mix is a free (6:22 - 6:29)
to start puzzle game for the Nintendo (6:25 - 6:30)
switch and smart devices work together (6:29 - 6:32)
to complete puzzles and create wonderful (6:30 - 6:34)
drinks and dishes to serve at your (6:32 - 6:37)
Pokemon cafe this is pretty much (6:34 - 6:40)
tsumtsum it is a Pokemon version of (6:37 - 6:43)
tsumtsum okay I mean it was multiple (6:40 - 6:46)
games not just one is it really just one (6:43 - 6:49)
game yeah it's just the like drag to (6:46 - 6:52)
match the if you've never played Tsun (6:49 - 6:54)
Tsun i explain this i've never played it (6:52 - 6:55)
in the weird (6:54 - 6:57)
they just need to be drawing circles and (6:55 - 7:02)
then stopping into like 50 life right (6:57 - 7:04)
there I'm pretty sure Disney tsumtsum is (7:02 - 7:06)
a ripoff of another game but Disney (7:04 - 7:11)
tsumtsum is it's it's on mobile they (7:06 - 7:12)
have arcade machines of them in both (7:11 - 7:16)
America and in Japan tsumtsum whole (7:12 - 7:18)
gimmick in the arcade system was you (7:16 - 7:20)
would put your coins in and then you (7:18 - 7:22)
would get an actual figure and then you (7:20 - 7:23)
would scan the figure on the arcade (7:22 - 7:24)
machine and then it would remember (7:23 - 7:28)
Aladdin would have a different ultimate (7:24 - 7:31)
or a different super than then blink and (7:28 - 7:33)
beauty of the beast from Beauty and the (7:31 - 7:35)
Beast or from like Nemo like they would (7:33 - 7:37)
have different things but ideally in (7:35 - 7:40)
tsumtsum and I'm not sure I'm I don't (7:37 - 7:42)
know about cafe mix because we haven't (7:40 - 7:44)
seen enough about it but tsumtsum would (7:42 - 7:45)
pretty much have four different (7:44 - 7:49)
characters like buzz woody the thing (7:45 - 7:53)
from wall-e wall-e the thing for wall-e (7:49 - 7:57)
wall-e wall-e emotionally and like (7:53 - 7:59)
Cinderella and then you would have to (7:57 - 8:01)
match their faces they would be all (7:59 - 8:03)
jumbled up and you would have to drag (8:01 - 8:04)
all the buzzes to match and then all the (8:03 - 8:06)
buzzes disappear and then more drop down (8:04 - 8:08)
and then it's usually like you usually (8:06 - 8:10)
have like 60 or 120 seconds but you're (8:08 - 8:13)
trying to combo and keep matching them (8:10 - 8:15)
as fast as possible to get a high score (8:13 - 8:17)
so there's really no wind condition or a (8:15 - 8:19)
loose condition the wind condition is (8:17 - 8:21)
just beating your high score over and (8:19 - 8:23)
over but normally if you do a big enough (8:21 - 8:25)
combo you'll have ability of a like a (8:23 - 8:27)
super I don't know buzzes super might be (8:25 - 8:30)
it might turn all the Cinderella's into (8:27 - 8:32)
more buzzes so it would be easier to (8:30 - 8:35)
drag and match them so this isn't like a (8:32 - 8:36)
bejeweled thing you are literally just (8:35 - 8:39)
able to drag them around in a path and (8:36 - 8:42)
be like I did those figure-eight and hit (8:39 - 8:44)
all these and then release and that (8:42 - 8:46)
counts yeah the more you've linked (8:44 - 8:49)
together is like the the better that it (8:46 - 8:51)
is it looks a little different than (8:49 - 8:54)
tsumtsum when I see their dumb dragging (8:51 - 8:55)
it it seems that they're pushing and (8:54 - 8:58)
dragging at the same time which seems to (8:55 - 8:59)
me doesn't have they're kind of locked (8:58 - 9:02)
into place until you're done matching (8:59 - 9:03)
them and then they disappear and then (9:02 - 9:05)
everything falls this looks to have a (9:03 - 9:08)
little bit of a push feature either way (9:05 - 9:09)
I'm always (9:08 - 9:11)
down for a puzzle game I haven't I (9:09 - 9:12)
haven't had a good puzzle game in my (9:11 - 9:15)
life in a while art cute I'm into this (9:12 - 9:18)
hot liquid cocoa that is such a cute (9:15 - 9:20)
little I want that in real life I'll (9:18 - 9:22)
probably pay it play it for an hour and (9:20 - 9:26)
I'm back to garden escapes with me maybe (9:22 - 9:28)
this is your new garden escapes because (9:26 - 9:30)
you get to build out there nowadays I (9:28 - 9:32)
doubt it but look at all the cute (9:30 - 9:35)
helpers you can get but I can get the (9:32 - 9:37)
stimulus hang things and the new (9:35 - 9:40)
disappear you need to match 17 things (9:37 - 9:42)
and then they disappear no I don't know (9:40 - 9:44)
if the appeal is there look at that (9:42 - 9:48)
Lucario in an apron and little you know (9:44 - 9:51)
newsy cabin it's so cute is a Lucario in (9:48 - 9:53)
an apron that's true and a newsie hat (9:51 - 9:55)
even though this is on the antenna (9:53 - 9:57)
switch I tweeted about this but it looks (9:55 - 9:58)
like you will only be able to play this (9:57 - 10:00)
in handheld mode and then it's a no (9:58 - 10:02)
switch probably because it's it's a (10:00 - 10:04)
touchscreen game I don't know how you (10:02 - 10:08)
would drag and match with sticks well we (10:04 - 10:10)
used to have to do that in Robotron 20 (10:08 - 10:14)
what was that 20 40 but there was no (10:10 - 10:16)
dragging and matching in Robotron oh but (10:14 - 10:18)
you had two sticks does move things (10:16 - 10:21)
around true you well one was to move (10:18 - 10:22)
your feet and the other was to aim your (10:21 - 10:26)
laser Oh Roberto in 2084 we are not that (10:22 - 10:30)
far from that future horrible future of (10:26 - 10:32)
a mutant gets prepared it's only 64 (10:30 - 10:37)
years away it looks that the developer (10:32 - 10:40)
is just it just says Nintendo creatures (10:37 - 10:42)
Game Freak which probably means that (10:40 - 10:44)
creatures worked on this game I believe (10:42 - 10:49)
creatures also helps mostly with Pokemon (10:44 - 10:50)
shuffle which is another puzzle game (10:49 - 10:53)
creatures makes games every now and then (10:50 - 10:56)
yeah but usually if it's made by Game (10:53 - 10:58)
Freak they say made by game they look (10:56 - 11:01)
Game Freak is very they put their name (10:58 - 11:04)
on things like quest so I think I think (11:01 - 11:06)
this is probably made by creatures and (11:04 - 11:08)
I'm assuming Pokemon smile is also made (11:06 - 11:10)
by creatures since we don't see a (11:08 - 11:12)
different develop here here on the (11:10 - 11:15)
bottom of bottom of the website but that (11:12 - 11:18)
gets to the third game announcement (11:15 - 11:24)
which is very badly titled but new (11:18 - 11:27)
I got into this (11:24 - 11:30)
we watched the thing and then Brent's (11:27 - 11:33)
co-worker was like oh is Greg super (11:30 - 11:35)
excited for Pokemon snap too and I was (11:33 - 11:38)
like no cuz it's not called Pokemon snap (11:35 - 11:42)
dude it's called new Pokemon snap he's (11:38 - 11:43)
like so what happens when they make (11:42 - 11:47)
another lame apple (11:43 - 11:49)
I blame Apple they did this they did (11:47 - 11:52)
this is an apples this is Apple's fault (11:49 - 11:54)
yes it is yeah 100% (11:52 - 11:57)
just give it a number give it a version (11:54 - 12:00)
name it something else I mean there is (11:57 - 12:02)
problems with there is problems with (12:00 - 12:04)
naming it too because then people feel (12:02 - 12:06)
like they they didn't play the first one (12:04 - 12:09)
and put him on digital photography (12:06 - 12:15)
that's exists when the end I mean they (12:09 - 12:23)
could have done Pokemon snap : you take (12:15 - 12:25)
a picture you said it to your friends (12:23 - 12:28)
perfect licensing and cross-promotion (12:25 - 12:30)
opportunity Pokemon tick tock (12:28 - 12:36)
alright hold on he says the new Pokemon (12:30 - 12:38)
snap game for the Nintendo switches (12:36 - 12:40)
based on its namesake which was the (12:38 - 12:44)
first released for the Nintendo 64 in (12:40 - 12:47)
1999 this game will take trainers on an (12:44 - 12:48)
adventure to the unknown island (12:47 - 12:50)
overflowing with natural sites such as (12:48 - 12:53)
jungles and beaches where they can (12:50 - 12:55)
research various Pokemon in their (12:53 - 12:57)
natural habitats they will take photos (12:55 - 13:00)
to make their very own in-game photo (12:57 - 13:00)
decks (13:00 - 13:03)
Pokemon photo decks all why discovering (13:00 - 13:06)
new never-before-seen Pokemon (13:03 - 13:08)
expressions and behaviors there's no way (13:06 - 13:11)
this games coming out this year nope (13:08 - 13:18)
really yes why why because we don't even (13:11 - 13:20)
know when to the detective Pikachu (13:18 - 13:23)
sequels coming out then I thought a year (13:20 - 13:26)
ago whatever happened to like (13:23 - 13:28)
under-promise and over-deliver they (13:26 - 13:31)
they've messed up a few of the orders of (13:28 - 13:33)
these words who here over-promising and (13:31 - 13:33)
under-delivering (13:33 - 13:41)
oh I just I could see this coming out in (13:33 - 13:43)
October if it wasn't for the fact that (13:41 - 13:45)
cafe mix is also coming out the other (13:43 - 13:48)
DLC is coming out in November like if I (13:45 - 13:51)
can't think of a time this year unless (13:48 - 13:54)
they do it around August that this has (13:51 - 13:56)
breathing room yeah (13:54 - 13:59)
hmm yeah I just (13:56 - 14:03)
they didn't even like say like all of (13:59 - 14:06)
yeah they said nothing 2020 I mean maybe (14:03 - 14:08)
it comes out like spring of 2021 like I (14:06 - 14:10)
could see it coming or out around my (14:08 - 14:14)
Pokemon day the fact that we didn't hear (14:10 - 14:16)
from Pokemon sleep and we didn't hear (14:14 - 14:18)
about detective Pikachu to which we (14:16 - 14:20)
might be hear about you know in the (14:18 - 14:22)
upcoming announcement it's just like I (14:20 - 14:23)
don't I don't know if this game is (14:22 - 14:26)
coming anytime soon which is whatever (14:23 - 14:28)
it's fine I think I think announcing it (14:26 - 14:30)
was probably good enough I'm on the (14:28 - 14:32)
website it says get ready for a new (14:30 - 14:33)
Pokemon snap an all-new adventure for (14:32 - 14:35)
them to send us which inspired by the (14:33 - 14:38)
classic Nintendo 64 game Pokemon snap in (14:35 - 14:40)
new Pokemon snap you explored depths of (14:38 - 14:43)
deserts jungles and more as you (14:40 - 14:45)
photograph fan favorite Pokemon and (14:43 - 14:46)
never-before-seen Pokemon expressions (14:45 - 14:50)
and behaviors we saw that there were pre (14:46 - 14:51)
marina we saw that there were drifloon (14:50 - 14:55)
we saw Torterra and square bunny and (14:51 - 14:58)
Audrey oh so well only the fan favorites (14:55 - 15:03)
not the fan not favorites now also the (14:58 - 15:05)
reason we brought up developers of the (15:03 - 15:07)
last two games it specifically says at (15:05 - 15:08)
the bottom of this website that it is (15:07 - 15:11)
developed by Bandai Namco they have also (15:08 - 15:15)
made Hoke pokken tournament I think they (15:11 - 15:17)
also made Katamari Damacy the greatest (15:15 - 15:20)
game of all time so you know I feel like (15:17 - 15:25)
they've also made a ton of Naruto yes (15:20 - 15:28)
man got to make money somehow can't all (15:25 - 15:31)
be great Bart so I know there's a ton of (15:28 - 15:32)
people out there who haven't played (15:31 - 15:34)
pokemon snap probably just because of (15:32 - 15:37)
their age pokemon snaps like a 20 year (15:34 - 15:41)
old game for the Nintendo 64 but I don't (15:37 - 15:43)
I just like Mario Kart there's not a (15:41 - 15:47)
person that I have ever met that hated (15:43 - 15:47)
Pokemon (15:47 - 15:52)
I think it's just a pretty universally (15:47 - 15:55)
liked franchise game well not franchise (15:52 - 16:07)
there was no okay so okay I rented (15:55 - 16:11)
Pokemon snap from the video store (16:07 - 16:13)
blockbuster was at Blockbuster not (16:11 - 16:18)
blockbuster Tomek video no local DC team (16:13 - 16:21)
monka monka I'm not quite (16:18 - 16:24)
they had numerous stores but either way (16:21 - 16:27)
successful mod but I played it for two (16:24 - 16:29)
hours I couldn't figure out what was (16:27 - 16:33)
going on and I returned it and got a (16:29 - 16:35)
different game that is my history of (16:33 - 16:36)
Pokemon snap (16:35 - 16:40)
I played the heck out of Pokemon stand (16:36 - 16:40)
because it's like you take a picture and (16:40 - 16:45)
it's like was my picture good enough I (16:43 - 16:48)
don't want a computer judging my phone (16:45 - 16:52)
look I'll give you a hot tip in Pokemon (16:48 - 16:53)
snap the computer doesn't even know if (16:52 - 16:59)
your photos it was either wonderful or (16:53 - 17:02)
it was maybe next time or whatever the (16:59 - 17:05)
he says oh but and you have to throw the (17:02 - 17:07)
apples to make the Pokemon come out and (17:05 - 17:11)
the shock balls so you have to aim and (17:07 - 17:15)
hit and you're on Rails it's so much so (17:11 - 17:18)
much going on that you can make you can (17:15 - 17:20)
make electrodes blow up and drop down (17:18 - 17:23)
Kakuna x' was a good game yeah yeah I (17:20 - 17:26)
mean it was good here's the thing for (17:23 - 17:28)
what it did which was virtually nothing (17:26 - 17:32)
it did that well it was fun to actually (17:28 - 17:34)
see for the first time ever in Pokemon (17:32 - 17:39)
snap Pokemon in a habitat my concern (17:34 - 17:41)
about this is they have changed the (17:39 - 17:43)
games so that they're already appearing (17:41 - 17:46)
in their habitat so I'm not sure how (17:43 - 17:49)
much awe and wonder a new generation is (17:46 - 17:51)
gonna get out of snap and I'm not sure (17:49 - 17:54)
that people who are now in their 20s and (17:51 - 17:56)
30s who played this first when they're (17:54 - 17:59)
kids are gonna have a ton of fun that's (17:56 - 18:01)
not that's gonna go past (17:59 - 18:04)
their initial half an hour of install (18:01 - 18:05)
juh like there has to be some decent (18:04 - 18:09)
gameplay in this to make it successful (18:05 - 18:12)
for people I think I think what Pokemon (18:09 - 18:15)
snap does well and I was I was a kid (18:12 - 18:17)
when pokemon snap came out so what were (18:15 - 18:19)
Nintendo 64 games they were like 40 (18:17 - 18:23)
bucks 50 bucks high brainer it (18:19 - 18:25)
they were usually around 30 I think 30 (18:23 - 18:27)
or 40 I want to say there were 40 (18:25 - 18:29)
because weren't gameboy games 30 yeah (18:27 - 18:31)
yeah maybe that anyways but like even (18:29 - 18:34)
though pokemon snap is is is actually (18:31 - 18:37)
like a 45 minute game if you if you know (18:34 - 18:41)
if you've played it before and like to (18:37 - 18:43)
get some you which is I guess the the (18:41 - 18:45)
final part of that game spoiler there's (18:43 - 18:47)
sixty three Pokemon in Pokemon snap the (18:45 - 18:51)
last one you get to is mu and then when (18:47 - 18:53)
you can't take a picture of it that's (18:51 - 18:55)
kind of like the the end of it you know (18:53 - 18:57)
if you played it before you can usually (18:55 - 18:59)
beat that game in like 45 minutes maybe (18:57 - 19:01)
ninety minutes if if you need to redo a (18:59 - 19:03)
course or whatever but it's a relatively (19:01 - 19:05)
short game mm-hmm but I don't think that (19:03 - 19:08)
that's inherently bad by itself because (19:05 - 19:10)
it makes up for that with with its charm (19:08 - 19:14)
that game used with personality but that (19:10 - 19:17)
was also in a time where Pokemon Stadium (19:14 - 19:19)
also used with personality because yeah (19:17 - 19:22)
we we didn't have like the only thing we (19:19 - 19:25)
had was these the Gameboy images like we (19:22 - 19:27)
had like these very small pixelated (19:25 - 19:29)
black and white things so seeing like (19:27 - 19:32)
your black and white pixelated Charizard (19:29 - 19:35)
being a full-on moving Charizard in a (19:32 - 19:37)
video game what that was the impressive (19:35 - 19:41)
thing that was awe-inspiring yes yes and (19:37 - 19:42)
there's a lot of things in Pokemon snap (19:41 - 19:45)
that that are just very memorable like (19:42 - 19:47)
getting all the charm Anders to line up (19:45 - 19:48)
and then all of them screaming at you (19:47 - 19:53)
for the apples and I think like Pokemon (19:48 - 19:55)
snap even though like the gameplay is (19:53 - 19:58)
very shallow and and I think most people (19:55 - 20:00)
who love Pokemon and snap well while (19:58 - 20:02)
they'll probably talk about their (20:00 - 20:04)
memories of the charm Anders or the the (20:02 - 20:06)
Mull trace but busting out of that egg (20:04 - 20:08)
no one really talks about like the (20:06 - 20:11)
engaging gameplay which is pretty much (20:08 - 20:13)
non-existent like you're taking pictures (20:11 - 20:15)
the the (20:13 - 20:17)
does a very bad job at determining (20:15 - 20:19)
whether that picture is good or bad and (20:17 - 20:22)
at the end of the day like your I guess (20:19 - 20:24)
you could it could be like a Tetris game (20:22 - 20:25)
where you're like oh well you're only (20:24 - 20:26)
competing against yourself to get a (20:25 - 20:28)
higher score of your picture but a lot (20:26 - 20:31)
of that is just rng of will the computer (20:28 - 20:33)
actually accept this as a better picture (20:31 - 20:37)
so I don't know how they capture that (20:33 - 20:40)
again mechanically I think they can (20:37 - 20:43)
definitely hit it out of the park with (20:40 - 20:46)
the expressions and the animations and (20:43 - 20:48)
making you and I think if we look at (20:46 - 20:50)
sword and shield with cup foo I don't (20:48 - 20:52)
think a lot of people went into sword (20:50 - 20:54)
and shield being like oh man I'm excited (20:52 - 20:56)
for cup foo but I think if anything the (20:54 - 20:58)
story did this is not a spoiler is the (20:56 - 21:00)
story makes you walk away appreciating (20:58 - 21:03)
Cup food because they gave cub foo time (21:00 - 21:05)
to shine and I think they can do that (21:03 - 21:06)
and snap with Pokemon so I'm not worried (21:05 - 21:08)
about that part I'm more worried about (21:06 - 21:10)
like mechanically is this gonna be fun (21:08 - 21:12)
to go through it time and time again (21:10 - 21:15)
because as a kid it was but as an adult (21:12 - 21:19)
I don't know well I mean we'll all give (21:15 - 21:20)
it a try and then we'll either be (21:19 - 21:23)
pleasantly surprised or I wouldn't say (21:20 - 21:25)
disappointed because I think our (21:23 - 21:29)
expectations are right do we think this (21:25 - 21:33)
is gonna be a full $60 game yes hundra's (21:29 - 21:37)
oh look the Zelda that that zelda links (21:33 - 21:41)
awakening the remake of a $7.99 shop (21:37 - 21:43)
game on the 3ds they remade it they (21:41 - 21:45)
charged $60 and people lost their minds (21:43 - 21:48)
it like Pokemon carries they lost their (21:45 - 21:49)
minds because they thought that price (21:48 - 21:51)
was inappropriate for a complete reskin (21:49 - 21:54)
of a former two-dimensional game into (21:51 - 21:56)
something with three dimensions yes then (21:54 - 21:58)
they thought that Link's Awakening (21:56 - 22:01)
should should have been $40 instead of (21:58 - 22:05)
60 now now that's that that I cannot (22:01 - 22:07)
agree with all they did was copy and (22:05 - 22:10)
paste an older game there's no way this (22:07 - 22:13)
is about $50 right they tried they not (22:10 - 22:16)
only charged no $60 for easily this game (22:13 - 22:20)
is not $60 no III they charged $60 for (22:16 - 22:21)
pokken tournament and then they (22:20 - 22:22)
re-released in the Wii U and charged (22:21 - 22:25)
another 60 or they away from any use for (22:22 - 22:28)
$60 pokken tournament and then they re (22:25 - 22:29)
released it on switch (22:28 - 22:32)
and again charge $60 there's no way this (22:29 - 22:36)
game is not so here's the deal I this (22:32 - 22:39)
give me a price point per number this (22:36 - 22:41)
and for all future Pokemon games this is (22:39 - 22:43)
that you give me a price point per (22:41 - 22:46)
number of Pokemon in the game and that's (22:43 - 22:49)
what okay it's like a dollar 25 per (22:46 - 22:51)
Pokemon so as many as you can jam in (22:49 - 22:53)
there that's as many as much money as (22:51 - 22:57)
your that's way too expensive that's 23 (22:53 - 23:04)
cents per Pokemon you think it do you (22:57 - 23:07)
want it to be $40 or do you think it'll (23:04 - 23:09)
be $40 you think for a game that is on (23:07 - 23:12)
Rails where you're only unless they've (23:09 - 23:16)
made like super significant changes well (23:12 - 23:18)
they have to though like there's no way (23:16 - 23:20)
it's the same thing where it's like you (23:18 - 23:23)
can't walk around you're just you are on (23:20 - 23:25)
this guided thing and it's like you aim (23:23 - 23:28)
your camera and throw an apple and hope (23:25 - 23:29)
that you mm-hmm (23:28 - 23:32)
that ain't worth $60 friend I know and (23:29 - 23:36)
the graphics didn't even look that good (23:32 - 23:36)
the amount of people that were like I (23:38 - 23:49)
don't excited for a game and not put (23:41 - 23:50)
down another game but the amount of (23:49 - 23:51)
people that were like this is what sword (23:50 - 23:54)
and shield graphics should have been but (23:51 - 23:56)
they're totally like you're comparing an (23:54 - 23:59)
open-world RPG to an on Rails video game (23:56 - 24:02)
from 30 seconds of footage that we don't (23:59 - 24:03)
even know what the rest of the game (24:02 - 24:04)
looks like we don't even know if that's (24:03 - 24:06)
we don't even know if that's just like (24:04 - 24:09)
CG footage or that's like early render (24:06 - 24:11)
like that's so frustrating like you can (24:09 - 24:13)
be excited for snap without like (24:11 - 24:15)
throwing sword and shield under the bus (24:13 - 24:17)
and I feel like every time people bring (24:15 - 24:18)
up certain chills graphics there they (24:17 - 24:21)
only focus on the wild area which is (24:18 - 24:22)
like very bad like the wild area looks (24:21 - 24:25)
like trash like no one no one's saying (24:22 - 24:28)
that but especially now but like all of (24:25 - 24:30)
these it's all of the actual routes (24:28 - 24:32)
outside of the wild area are pretty (24:30 - 24:35)
awesome yeah I mean like I would I would (24:32 - 24:37)
probably say that pokken tournament (24:35 - 24:40)
looks better than sword and shield but (24:37 - 24:42)
also pokken tournament has like 10 (24:40 - 24:43)
arenas and like (24:42 - 24:47)
20 Pokemon yep like it's that's that's (24:43 - 24:49)
that's the key right there as well a lot (24:47 - 24:51)
of information that has to be stored and (24:49 - 24:55)
the routes are all set camera like (24:51 - 24:57)
everything that set cameras a lot easier (24:55 - 25:00)
to design because you don't have to have (24:57 - 25:02)
people try to move the camera and to (25:00 - 25:03)
make sure that it looks good from every (25:02 - 25:05)
angle you are presenting a fully (25:03 - 25:08)
rendered graphical gorgeous (25:05 - 25:10)
representation and that's a lot of (25:08 - 25:13)
what's gonna happen in snap you are in a (25:10 - 25:14)
painting that you can spin around and (25:13 - 25:18)
look at set paintings but it's not it is (25:14 - 25:20)
not the same as fully having to go up (25:18 - 25:23)
and interact and shake a tree and I mean (25:20 - 25:24)
they're very very different things (25:23 - 25:27)
I did ask on Twitter I said how many (25:24 - 25:32)
assuming that all 892 I guess that'll (25:27 - 25:35)
eventually be 95 when the other DLC (25:32 - 25:39)
comes out assuming that not all 800 some (25:35 - 25:40)
Pokemon are in it how many would be (25:39 - 25:43)
worth it to you well they can't be (25:40 - 25:45)
because it's only the fan favorites (25:43 - 25:47)
yeah there's no way it has all 800 (25:45 - 25:51)
Pokemon 21% said 200 to 300 we would be (25:47 - 25:55)
okay 31% said 300 to 400 would be okay (25:51 - 25:59)
18% said that 400 to 500 would be okay (25:55 - 26:04)
and 29% wanted 500 plus Pokemon in (25:59 - 26:08)
Pokemon snap so in the original game it (26:04 - 26:13)
was 63 it was a 63 64 because it was the (26:08 - 26:16)
Nintendo 64 but they couldn't get Ekans (26:13 - 26:19)
to work so they pulled Ekans last minute (26:16 - 26:26)
back together and I said a bad word so (26:19 - 26:32)
that and and and that was before Jen - (26:26 - 26:36)
yeah that was before Jo Jo correct yeah (26:32 - 26:39)
that was so we're looking at about 40% (26:36 - 26:43)
of all Pokemon is what the producers of (26:39 - 26:45)
the game feel is inadequate number of (26:43 - 26:48)
Pokemon to appear in the game so what's (26:45 - 26:53)
40% of 893 300 ish (26:48 - 27:00)
three well a 50% of 900 is 450 then 40% (26:53 - 27:02)
is between 300 and 400 I think I think (27:00 - 27:05)
it's about 400 so there you go (27:02 - 27:13)
400 this time doing it yeah I don't I (27:05 - 27:15)
don't know mystery dungeon or a ranger (27:13 - 27:18)
or any of those other games enough to (27:15 - 27:21)
know like like I like mystery dungeon (27:18 - 27:23)
doesn't have you know 200 maybe it does (27:21 - 27:25)
does it have like 300 Pokemon in it I (27:23 - 27:28)
don't think it does have you I have no (27:25 - 27:30)
idea the new one (27:28 - 27:33)
um oh it's got a lot wasn't super missed (27:30 - 27:37)
even maybe rumble was there there had to (27:33 - 27:38)
be a rumble that had like all of them up (27:37 - 27:39)
to the point right (27:38 - 27:41)
I think rump I think one of the rumbles (27:39 - 27:44)
did are we talking about the new rescue (27:41 - 27:47)
team DX yeah yeah yeah Mike that's it (27:44 - 27:49)
that's us which game it has this the (27:47 - 27:51)
power of the switch and what is that (27:49 - 27:54)
magical power I don't know I think my (27:51 - 27:56)
favorite thing to come out of the (27:54 - 27:59)
Pokemon snap announcement and maybe it's (27:56 - 28:00)
cuz I'm like being cynical here but the (27:59 - 28:03)
people that were like I finally I was (28:00 - 28:06)
five I told you I'm Pokemon staff coming (28:03 - 28:09)
yeah I mean yeah sure I guess if you say (28:06 - 28:11)
pokemon snap every year for the last 20 (28:09 - 28:12)
years I guess you'll eventually be here (28:11 - 28:15)
right you heard it here first (28:12 - 28:17)
I bet eventually they'll redo a Gen 6 (28:15 - 28:19)
Pokemon game and we'll get us will get (28:17 - 28:21)
something X&Y related probably the next (28:19 - 28:24)
20 years if I keep saying it often [ __ ] (28:21 - 28:27)
I'll eventually be right sure it looks (28:24 - 28:32)
like mystery dungeon had 480 okay (28:27 - 28:34)
roughly that's a pretty good number yeah (28:32 - 28:36)
I mean we're so we're counting (28:34 - 28:39)
evolutions right like yeah yes including (28:36 - 28:41)
their voice yeah yeah yeah there's like (28:39 - 28:43)
so many questions like how long is a (28:41 - 28:45)
route how many routes are on it or the (28:43 - 28:46)
Pokemon changing on their routes like (28:45 - 28:48)
obviously the the easy things to answer (28:46 - 28:50)
they're hidden things right like when (28:48 - 28:52)
you first did the the first Beach route (28:50 - 28:55)
in in the original you know Scyther was (28:52 - 28:56)
in the grass and you had to kind of like (28:55 - 28:58)
hopefully throw your pester balls in (28:56 - 29:00)
there to hit him and then he would pop (28:58 - 29:02)
up and then be like I found him so I I (29:00 - 29:04)
don't doubt there would be a bunch of (29:02 - 29:06)
hidden stuff but you know if I'm it (29:04 - 29:08)
looks like at least I'm assuming they're (29:06 - 29:10)
gonna redo the beach route for the first (29:08 - 29:11)
route because that's what they hinted at (29:10 - 29:12)
at the trailer and then there will be (29:11 - 29:15)
new routes after that but if we go (29:12 - 29:16)
through a route are they gonna change (29:15 - 29:18)
the Pokemon it's gonna be the same are (29:16 - 29:20)
they gonna add whether we're like oh (29:18 - 29:22)
because it's raining in the route now (29:20 - 29:24)
you're gonna see more water pokemon like (29:22 - 29:26)
if they're gonna do even if they're (29:24 - 29:29)
gonna do 200 Pokemon which is four times (29:26 - 29:32)
the amount that was in the original I (29:29 - 29:34)
mean the routes in the original were (29:32 - 29:37)
already pretty crowded with Pokemon yeah (29:34 - 29:40)
like you were pretty actively taking (29:37 - 29:44)
pictures of things the entire time (29:40 - 29:46)
and I don't what was the average length (29:44 - 29:49)
on a route like maybe four minutes yeah (29:46 - 29:51)
they weren't particularly they weren't (29:49 - 29:54)
long like far in that game I feel like (29:51 - 29:57)
even four minutes is too long but maybe (29:54 - 30:00)
that I mean yep maybe five minutes max (29:57 - 30:02)
they were not long (30:00 - 30:04)
yeah I'm just curious how they do it I (30:02 - 30:09)
think they can I'm not I don't I feel (30:04 - 30:11)
like it would be very hard to make it a (30:09 - 30:14)
bad game I just don't know how they make (30:11 - 30:16)
it I just don't know how a Pokemon snap (30:14 - 30:20)
looks in 2020 yeah I mean there's a (30:16 - 30:22)
thing though where I mean they still (30:20 - 30:25)
have the I'm assuming take the pictures (30:22 - 30:27)
then post them to social media which was (30:25 - 30:29)
like replicating the going and having (30:27 - 30:31)
them printed out thing so at least you (30:29 - 30:34)
can take some good pictures and share (30:31 - 30:36)
them and I think that will extend the (30:34 - 30:41)
life actually make memes yeah absolutely (30:36 - 30:45)
in I if any company could do it the (30:41 - 30:48)
Pokemon company could definitely have it (30:45 - 30:52)
where you you at the end of the game you (30:48 - 30:53)
say like I want to order these prints (30:52 - 30:55)
and then they mail it to you like they (30:53 - 30:58)
could do it by touch her prints in a (30:55 - 31:03)
frame yeah I snapped these um based (30:58 - 31:05)
based on the base and the fact that I'm (31:03 - 31:09)
that 63 percent I think of all of their (31:05 - 31:13)
revenue ever is is merchandise yeah I (31:09 - 31:16)
feel like they could sell us postcard / (31:13 - 31:19)
stickers of our pictures at the end of (31:16 - 31:22)
the game and they could probably find (31:19 - 31:26)
some company that just fulfills it and (31:22 - 31:29)
ships it to you at a cost I mean they (31:26 - 31:36)
convinced blockbuster to put giant they (31:29 - 31:38)
could do that 20 years ago they can (31:36 - 31:39)
convince some company or send us (31:38 - 31:42)
something well heck if jackbox games can (31:39 - 31:46)
send out yeah yeah I think maybe the (31:42 - 31:49)
only worry is you know it's well it's (31:46 - 31:51)
the same worried that you know parents (31:49 - 31:52)
have had for the last ten years of the (31:51 - 31:54)
Apple AppStore is you know (31:52 - 31:56)
little Timmy picks up the phone and (31:54 - 31:57)
purchases (31:56 - 32:00)
hundred gems in clash Royale or a (31:57 - 32:02)
million gems in clash Royale and then (32:00 - 32:04)
you have to send a support thing my kid (32:02 - 32:07)
bought these I don't actually want to (32:04 - 32:09)
spend a hundred dollars on your game you (32:07 - 32:11)
probably don't come across this much (32:09 - 32:13)
because it's not the way you live your (32:11 - 32:16)
life but you can actually put parental (32:13 - 32:21)
restrictions on the switch I'm gonna say (32:16 - 32:23)
purchasing from snap requires your (32:21 - 32:26)
parents to put in the password yeah I (32:23 - 32:28)
think that would probably be the coolest (32:26 - 32:30)
thing to walk away from snap with though (32:28 - 32:32)
but being getting framed pictures yeah (32:30 - 32:34)
if they want to redo the hole in the (32:32 - 32:37)
soldier thing like the picture thing if (32:34 - 32:40)
they if they have a way to do that that (32:37 - 32:43)
would I I would be I would be very (32:40 - 32:45)
impressed and I kind of thought the snap (32:43 - 32:47)
was dead in the water (32:45 - 32:50)
you know because of Pokemon go like I (32:47 - 32:53)
have a very good camera in my pocket and (32:50 - 32:55)
I have at this point five hundred plus (32:53 - 32:59)
Pokemon in cuz they're at Gen 5 now that (32:55 - 33:02)
I can take pictures of in the world (32:59 - 33:05)
yeah but the what you can't do is a lot (33:02 - 33:07)
of interaction right like they have very (33:05 - 33:10)
set poses you can't see them interacting (33:07 - 33:13)
with each other real world is definitely (33:10 - 33:15)
not the vibrancy that the Pokemon world (33:13 - 33:20)
is there is a lot that snap can do that (33:15 - 33:22)
makes it look much more fantastical than (33:20 - 33:25)
me walking through a park and having my (33:22 - 33:28)
poorly rendered tree in the background (33:25 - 33:30)
of my Pokemon I definitely agree with (33:28 - 33:33)
that absolutely it was funny cuz like (33:30 - 33:35)
right before a sword and shield came out (33:33 - 33:38)
I think I was at Eurogamer I think it (33:35 - 33:40)
was Eurogamer asked Masoud oh why didn't (33:38 - 33:42)
they do a Pokemon snap and he was like (33:40 - 33:44)
we don't have any new ideas for it so (33:42 - 33:46)
that's why we've never remade it he was (33:44 - 33:50)
lied to them well that was what ten (33:46 - 33:53)
months ago at this point yeah okay so (33:50 - 33:55)
this game has been in development for (33:53 - 33:58)
three years so he lied to them I don't (33:55 - 34:00)
know about three years we don't know the (33:58 - 34:02)
development cycle of it yet but you want (34:00 - 34:03)
us to pay $60 for a game that they (34:02 - 34:06)
published and look they're produced in (34:03 - 34:09)
under China - no I'm just saying like is (34:06 - 34:11)
falling apart before your very eyes (34:09 - 34:13)
why why would he sit at an interview and (34:11 - 34:16)
say like it's the if the interviewer (34:13 - 34:17)
goes hey you make it a Pokemon snap (34:16 - 34:20)
where's you're supposed to say yeah yes (34:17 - 34:23)
that's a bad way announcing a game well (34:20 - 34:25)
I wouldn't say it in a way that makes it (34:23 - 34:28)
sound like why would we do that we are (34:25 - 34:30)
so uncreated we can't think I would say (34:28 - 34:33)
the time for a new snap has not appeared (34:30 - 34:35)
yet or something like that that's like (34:33 - 34:36)
mysterious but not a lie (34:35 - 34:38)
yeah but they still haven't even showed (34:36 - 34:41)
what the new feature is like his words (34:38 - 34:42)
were we haven't thought of a new feature (34:41 - 34:44)
yet and I'm that trailer I haven't seen (34:42 - 34:46)
what this new feature via the new (34:44 - 34:48)
feature is it's on the switch Congrats (34:46 - 34:49)
hey at least they didn't make the (34:48 - 34:52)
mistake of putting it on the Wii U there (34:49 - 34:54)
is like little to no information about (34:52 - 34:56)
this game though so I prepared to be (34:54 - 34:59)
pleasantly surprised maybe we just won't (34:56 - 35:01)
hear about it for the next year just (34:59 - 35:03)
like sleep and detect about you they'll (35:01 - 35:05)
just be like alright well we we said if (35:03 - 35:07)
we told you you'll get it when we're (35:05 - 35:10)
good and ready well I guess there's two (35:07 - 35:13)
bits the real quick one is in (35:10 - 35:15)
collaborative and collaboration with the (35:13 - 35:17)
antic the Pokemon company announced that (35:15 - 35:18)
mega evolutions will appear in the real (35:17 - 35:20)
world and Pokemon go fans can look (35:18 - 35:22)
forward to experiencing a new take on (35:20 - 35:25)
mega evolution that takes advantage of (35:22 - 35:31)
Pokemon goes unique gameplay I sure (35:25 - 35:31)
yeah I'm not particularly excited for (35:31 - 35:37)
this right cuz I don't I don't battle in (35:33 - 35:39)
Pokemon go sowhat's mega evolution gonna (35:37 - 35:42)
get me you've summed up all of X&Y auras (35:39 - 35:45)
and sunny mood if you're not in the (35:42 - 35:49)
battle a battle in those games yeah that (35:45 - 35:51)
was always the weird thing about mega (35:49 - 35:53)
evolution to me is like it was a battle (35:51 - 35:57)
mechanic but not a in my opinion a very (35:53 - 36:00)
interesting one because not only did you (35:57 - 36:02)
only have like 59 Pokemon to pick from (36:00 - 36:04)
forced you to build your team around (36:02 - 36:07)
those Pokemon specifically whereas like (36:04 - 36:11)
Dynomax I can pick any six and any six (36:07 - 36:13)
of those can die no max yeah and mega (36:11 - 36:16)
was like if I win against somebody who (36:13 - 36:18)
had a Kangaskhan on their team that's (36:16 - 36:23)
like well that's the one that's how they (36:18 - 36:25)
trick you yeah I don't know I whatever I (36:23 - 36:27)
like obviously mega evolution was gonna (36:25 - 36:30)
come I mean mega evolution is in Pokemon (36:27 - 36:34)
masters sar enough yeah well so some (36:30 - 36:36)
some trainers can mega evolve some come (36:34 - 36:39)
at ya some cash they just don't like (36:36 - 36:41)
their Pokemon enough so I I'll be (36:39 - 36:43)
curious to see what they do I'm I hope (36:41 - 36:45)
it's not something like you gotta (36:43 - 36:48)
collect all 59 mega stones by spinning (36:45 - 36:50)
stops seven days in a row and hope that (36:48 - 36:52)
I think the 1% chance to get the mega (36:50 - 36:55)
stone and I that's that that seems to be (36:52 - 36:57)
their summer thing right they said like (36:55 - 37:01)
this summer I think yeah okay last bit (36:57 - 37:02)
last bit of news before we take a break (37:01 - 37:04)
earn a shiny (37:02 - 37:07)
Zehra aura and armor right or in pokemon (37:04 - 37:11)
sword and pokemon shield if 1 million (37:07 - 37:14)
trainers defeat Zehra aura in max raid (37:11 - 37:16)
battles players can receive a special (37:14 - 37:18)
Pokemon along with items that will be (37:16 - 37:20)
useful in the island of armor (37:18 - 37:25)
okay let's there's more to it here the (37:20 - 37:28)
island armor armor the first part of the (37:25 - 37:29)
pokemon sword expansion past and the (37:28 - 37:30)
pokemon shield expansion pass has (37:29 - 37:32)
arrived to celebrate the release of the (37:30 - 37:34)
new chapter of pokemon sword and pokemon (37:32 - 37:35)
shield adventures players can (37:34 - 37:38)
participate in max raids against the (37:35 - 37:40)
mythical Pokemon Zehra aura from June (37:38 - 37:40)
17th (37:40 - 37:43)
to Sunday June 28th Zehra aura will (37:40 - 37:45)
appear in max rate battles (37:43 - 37:47)
your friends as you attempt to take down (37:45 - 37:49)
this mythical Pokemon Zehra aura has the (37:47 - 37:51)
append a potential to appear in three (37:49 - 37:54)
star max raids or higher and in five (37:51 - 37:56)
star max raids there is a chance that (37:54 - 37:58)
you can encounter an especially powerful (37:56 - 38:00)
shiny Zehra aura you won't be able to (37:58 - 38:03)
catch their aura after it's defeated but (38:00 - 38:05)
if at least 1 million trainers managed (38:03 - 38:07)
to defeat zero aura during the special (38:05 - 38:09)
event a Chinese air aura will be (38:07 - 38:11)
available to everyone in Pokemon home in (38:09 - 38:13)
addition to a shiny zero aura every (38:11 - 38:15)
player who takes part in these max rate (38:13 - 38:17)
battles will receive a piece of armor (38:15 - 38:21)
right or for every hundred thousand (38:17 - 38:23)
trainers that defeat Zahra aura after (38:21 - 38:25)
the first a million up to a maximum of (38:23 - 38:29)
ten pieces basic math is 2 million armor (38:25 - 38:31)
it--or can be used in the dojo of the (38:29 - 38:33)
island of armor if you have to have your (38:31 - 38:34)
Pokemon learn moves (38:33 - 38:37)
if the target numbers is reached you (38:34 - 38:39)
will be able to claim your Chinese air (38:37 - 38:41)
aura and your armor right or via mystery (38:39 - 38:44)
gifts on your mobile device of Pokemon (38:41 - 38:47)
home on Monday June 29th starting at 5 (38:44 - 38:50)
p.m. Pacific time until Monday July 6 (38:47 - 38:53)
note you do not have to have the (38:50 - 38:55)
expansion to encounter or to receive (38:53 - 38:58)
Zehra aura in order to claim these gifts (38:55 - 39:00)
you must meet the following condition (38:58 - 39:02)
all right so to make this very clear (39:00 - 39:05)
even if your if you're lazy and you (39:02 - 39:08)
don't do a single Zehra aura as long as (39:05 - 39:11)
you transfer a pokemon from home whose (39:08 - 39:15)
sword and shield between now and July 6 (39:11 - 39:18)
you will be able to redeem the zero aura (39:15 - 39:22)
if the community does the million if the (39:18 - 39:24)
community has a million people (39:22 - 39:26)
participate you have to transfer a (39:24 - 39:29)
Pokemon I would strongly encourage you (39:26 - 39:32)
to do as era aura because as of Friday (39:29 - 39:34)
morning I think we were only at two (39:32 - 39:36)
hundred and thirty seven thousand (39:34 - 39:40)
trainers and the lowboy we're back to (39:36 - 39:43)
Ultra Sun all tremé (39:40 - 39:46)
so it needs a million trainers what that (39:43 - 39:48)
means is it doesn't matter if you do one (39:46 - 39:51)
or twenty zero aura raids (39:48 - 39:54)
you only count as one trainer and the (39:51 - 39:57)
fact that on launch day and 48 hours (39:54 - 39:59)
after we're only at (39:57 - 40:02)
237,000 is very concerning (39:59 - 40:05)
look I've been busy where do I find this (40:02 - 40:09)
surah zero so the last update that I saw (40:05 - 40:12)
was two hundred and seventy two thousand (40:09 - 40:15)
three hundred and thirty five players (40:12 - 40:18)
okay that was on June 19th I have not (40:15 - 40:22)
seen an update since then okay so we are (40:18 - 40:25)
a little over horse of the way there is (40:22 - 40:26)
still a long way to go (40:25 - 40:30)
maybe because the DLC came out on a (40:26 - 40:32)
Wednesday people were busy with work and (40:30 - 40:35)
school I mean this and what that was pre (40:32 - 40:38)
weekend I was pre weekend yeah so we may (40:35 - 40:40)
get a big update over the weekend to (40:38 - 40:41)
talk about the shinies there or a real (40:40 - 40:41)
quick (40:41 - 40:44)
Sarah B is reporting that Chinese air (40:41 - 40:46)
aura has a five percent chance to appear (40:44 - 40:49)
in a five star raid while you cannot (40:46 - 40:51)
catch it it is significantly harder all (40:49 - 40:54)
these yeah five stars their auras are (40:51 - 40:56)
normally around level 60 like most five (40:54 - 40:58)
star Pokemon um the shinies their auras (40:56 - 41:01)
level 100 and you do get better rewards (40:58 - 41:04)
from it so if you want the challenge if (41:01 - 41:05)
you're if you're one of those people (41:04 - 41:07)
that were like I wish Pokemon was harder (41:05 - 41:09)
here you go (41:07 - 41:11)
yeah it's hard I still haven't cleared a (41:09 - 41:13)
shiny one they're not too terribly (41:11 - 41:17)
defined I it it's I needed a full team (41:13 - 41:22)
of humans to to do it you do get I think (41:17 - 41:24)
the rewards are significantly better so (41:22 - 41:27)
um I guess do your part (41:24 - 41:30)
do my best and what Greg and will (41:27 - 41:33)
referenced about ultrason ultrasonic (41:30 - 41:33)
moon-like well I think one of them was (41:33 - 41:37)
like catch five million Pokemon or (41:35 - 41:39)
something in a month and I don't even (41:37 - 41:42)
think we made it to Arian they're (41:39 - 41:44)
nowhere close because that was the first (41:42 - 41:47)
one and then the then the goals dropped (41:44 - 41:51)
significant oh yes absolutely so we have (41:47 - 41:54)
failed things before five people turn on (41:51 - 41:58)
the game please so I saw some people (41:54 - 42:00)
saying I don't worry they'll just give (41:58 - 42:06)
it to us ah no no no definitely failed a (42:00 - 42:07)
lot of different things in Sun and Moon (42:06 - 42:10)
and ultra Sun and ultramoon yeah I get (42:07 - 42:11)
it there were things you had to jump (42:10 - 42:13)
through that game you had to like talk (42:11 - 42:15)
to the festival Plaza chick and (42:13 - 42:16)
everything like I understand there was (42:15 - 42:19)
more hoops to jump through but we (42:16 - 42:21)
definitely failed a lot of them um we (42:19 - 42:23)
did pass some of them I think we passed (42:21 - 42:25)
the Wonder trade one and we passed the (42:23 - 42:28)
the Mantine surf one or something but (42:25 - 42:31)
well once they dropped the gold numbers (42:28 - 42:33)
yeah we pat they started clicking those (42:31 - 42:35)
off real quick but the first one the (42:33 - 42:37)
product is first three that were like (42:35 - 42:41)
really lofty goals all of those Oh hard (42:37 - 42:44)
for whatever magical reason a million (42:41 - 42:46)
people do it we get the zero aura if (42:44 - 42:48)
then another million people do it we'd (42:46 - 42:51)
get a zero or a plus ten armor right or (42:48 - 42:58)
but maybe you don't you don't need the (42:51 - 43:00)
expansion to do it you don't need the (42:58 - 43:02)
expansion to receive it I guess now now (43:00 - 43:05)
is the now's the time I think a lot of (43:02 - 43:06)
people are missing their aura for the (43:05 - 43:07)
Pokedex this is the second time they'll (43:06 - 43:10)
be distributing it yep (43:07 - 43:12)
go get them maybe it'll give us a pity (43:10 - 43:16)
prize of the regular one if we don't hit (43:12 - 43:20)
maybe I hope so okay let's take a break (43:16 - 43:21)
when we come back we're gonna talk about (43:20 - 43:25)
our thoughts of the Isle of armor we're (43:21 - 43:27)
gonna set the story stuff aside but (43:25 - 43:29)
everything else will be fair game so we (43:27 - 43:32)
will be right back (43:29 - 43:32)

to avoid buying the wrong version you (44:52 - 44:57)
start your game go to the menu screen (44:54 - 44:59)
and buy it from there it's only and let (44:57 - 45:03)
you buy the one you want no I like all (44:59 - 45:06)
day on Wednesday I went in and was (45:03 - 45:08)
playing and didn't get any announcement (45:06 - 45:09)
that it was available but then Thursday (45:08 - 45:12)
morning when I started up to do my (45:09 - 45:14)
morning I'm still trying to finish my (45:12 - 45:16)
pokedex yeah a little thing popped up (45:14 - 45:19)
and says oh you have an Armour pass did (45:16 - 45:21)
little B and then took me I could go to (45:19 - 45:23)
the train station and it was like but I (45:21 - 45:25)
was expecting my armor passed yesterday (45:23 - 45:27)
yeah I had the forest mind to download a (45:25 - 45:30)
cup like I was really working on my I (45:27 - 45:32)
was working my switch to make it (45:30 - 45:35)
download I had I had no problems full (45:32 - 45:39)
disclosure uh Nintendo did send me two (45:35 - 45:41)
free copies of the expansion they'd sent (45:39 - 45:42)
me a free copy of the sword expansion (45:41 - 45:45)
and the shield expansion the they sent (45:42 - 45:47)
him to me lights so because I didn't (45:45 - 45:49)
want to wait I did buy the shield (45:47 - 45:50)
version myself which I have been playing (45:49 - 45:53)
just full disclosure Nintendo did (45:50 - 45:55)
provide me with free copies of the DLC (45:53 - 45:57)
that I have not redeemed yet just want (45:55 - 46:00)
to get that another way I'm really happy (45:57 - 46:04)
with the DLC and I guess if if the if (46:00 - 46:09)
our only comparison is were used to this (46:04 - 46:12)
third game I think this is better I (46:09 - 46:16)
think they were able to do it at least (46:12 - 46:19)
in this version and I think it was worth (46:16 - 46:22)
the money and I think there was enough (46:19 - 46:24)
things - there was enough things for (46:22 - 46:26)
somebody who likes a little bit of (46:24 - 46:28)
everything to feel satisfied and I can (46:26 - 46:30)
totally see if you (46:28 - 46:33)
only pokedex filler or if you were only (46:30 - 46:36)
a competitive battler that you might (46:33 - 46:39)
well competitive Ahlers there's no way (46:36 - 46:42)
they don't feel service yeah literally (46:39 - 46:45)
what this DLC who like story like me (46:42 - 46:49)
yeah mmm I think my fish might my first (46:45 - 46:51)
review that I gave both of you still (46:49 - 46:57)
stands it was worth $15 so there's a (46:51 - 47:00)
couple of things the story is really (46:57 - 47:04)
short and really thin this up bad is (47:00 - 47:08)
just I you know it made me smile yeah (47:04 - 47:11)
there's a couple yeah (47:08 - 47:13)
but overall it's just like oh like I (47:11 - 47:15)
finished it I was like oh okay well (47:13 - 47:19)
that's it uh-huh I heard and I I don't (47:15 - 47:21)
have this verified I heard if you do not (47:19 - 47:23)
finish postgame you actually don't get (47:21 - 47:26)
some of the story oh really (47:23 - 47:28)
yeah well that makes sense it does make (47:26 - 47:30)
sense because there's the important (47:28 - 47:32)
character development in the postgame (47:30 - 47:36)
and if you don't finish the post key (47:32 - 47:37)
I've heard that I'm not a hundred (47:36 - 47:40)
percent sure on that but well it does (47:37 - 47:42)
add an extra I don't know what twenty (47:40 - 47:44)
thirty minutes to the story yeah the (47:42 - 47:46)
part where it's very obvious where it's (47:44 - 47:47)
like oh okay (47:46 - 47:54)
god you're here yep I think the shining (47:47 - 47:57)
thing about the DLC is the island looks (47:54 - 48:00)
incredible oh yes much bigger than I (47:57 - 48:02)
thought it would be yeah the island (48:00 - 48:03)
looks incredible there's a lot to (48:02 - 48:07)
explore its varied its what the wild the (48:03 - 48:09)
negative I think is that it makes the (48:07 - 48:13)
first wild area feel worse can you (48:09 - 48:16)
expand can you both expand on that (48:13 - 48:17)
because I've been thinking about this (48:16 - 48:19)
for the last couple days and the the (48:17 - 48:22)
words I hear is it makes if this while (48:19 - 48:24)
there is what the old wild area should (48:22 - 48:27)
have been is what I've been hearing I (48:24 - 48:29)
mean that's one way of saying it sure (48:27 - 48:31)
yeah I don't know how to put that into (48:29 - 48:33)
words and I don't know if you guys have (48:31 - 48:36)
some thoughts on that the wild area as (48:33 - 48:38)
it is is very flat it's a very linear (48:36 - 48:41)
plane there are some ramps up and down (48:38 - 48:43)
but you can see every (48:41 - 48:46)
think it's incredibly one-dimensional (48:43 - 48:48)
when you're just looking at it like oh I (48:46 - 48:50)
can see all the way to the other end and (48:48 - 48:54)
whoa but even worse than that it's it's (48:50 - 48:57)
grass it's patches of tall grass its (48:54 - 49:00)
water features and there's the (48:57 - 49:01)
occasional tree with some sprouts around (49:00 - 49:03)
it yep hey there's a mountain over by (49:01 - 49:07)
Doral Adhan and there's the Burt (49:03 - 49:09)
tipped-over tower over by the dusk oh (49:07 - 49:13)
yeah there's no mountain there's there's (49:09 - 49:15)
like a you can't climb it but it's just (49:13 - 49:18)
like a giant stiglitz to like tight that (49:15 - 49:20)
you have to go around and Doral and (49:18 - 49:23)
Donna's on the other side of it that (49:20 - 49:26)
portion yeah it's just a big hill yeah (49:23 - 49:27)
there you go (49:26 - 49:31)
I know me too Mountain so what the isle (49:27 - 49:36)
of armour does very well is when you get (49:31 - 49:39)
to an area there's like a swamp area and (49:36 - 49:40)
actually feels and looks like a swamp (49:39 - 49:43)
like the grass varies the trees are (49:40 - 49:44)
knocked over (49:43 - 49:49)
it has a very diff the color palette (49:44 - 49:50)
which wasn't happening in the original (49:49 - 49:53)
area unless you went to does lately (49:50 - 49:55)
different by them like we are now in the (49:53 - 49:57)
desert so everything in here is beige (49:55 - 49:59)
and then when you leave the desert it (49:57 - 50:02)
goes back to being just green whereas (49:59 - 50:04)
the isle of armour varies the colors a (50:02 - 50:08)
lot since they've added caves you go in (50:04 - 50:10)
and out of things you get the sense that (50:08 - 50:13)
you're going up and down and through an (50:10 - 50:17)
actual terrain whereas the old wild area (50:13 - 50:19)
it still felt like you're just going up (50:17 - 50:22)
and down ramps on a single plane like (50:19 - 50:25)
the old area felt like a skate park (50:22 - 50:27)
compared to this that actually feels (50:25 - 50:32)
like an actual environment I think my (50:27 - 50:34)
initial thing was like oh there's still (50:32 - 50:37)
a lot of glare and Pokemon that we've (50:34 - 50:41)
already seen inhabiting in the world in (50:37 - 50:43)
here which was a little disappointing (50:41 - 50:44)
like when I went to the swap area and it (50:43 - 50:46)
was basically all dread now the first (50:44 - 50:48)
toe first things that show disappointing (50:46 - 50:53)
like oh they changed they do change but (50:48 - 50:55)
the firt that was my first experience I (50:53 - 50:57)
was like it's beautiful but it's all (50:55 - 51:00)
it's ultimately all the same Pokemon as (50:57 - 51:02)
the weather change and as you move (51:00 - 51:04)
through you got to see more things but (51:02 - 51:06)
initially I was like oh whomp like (51:04 - 51:08)
there's one or two things spawning that (51:06 - 51:10)
are new but as you export like you (51:08 - 51:13)
explore the various islands out into the (51:10 - 51:14)
bays they get a little bit more (51:13 - 51:16)
interesting they're colored different (51:14 - 51:18)
you have the sort of terrifying shark (51:16 - 51:21)
attack thing which does not help my (51:18 - 51:22)
shark fear at all (51:21 - 51:26)
Sharpedo is side side note Sharpedo is (51:22 - 51:28)
cool the only one time only the first (51:26 - 51:30)
only the first time that he gets real (51:28 - 51:33)
Annoying real quick for taking up (51:30 - 51:36)
essentially a small area it feels (51:33 - 51:39)
expansive because you move in and out (51:36 - 51:41)
and interact with the terrain in very (51:39 - 51:45)
different ways and the terrain changes (51:41 - 51:48)
naturally like when you go into a cave (51:45 - 51:50)
like theirs they chain they blend the (51:48 - 51:52)
color palette to make it seem like oh (51:50 - 51:53)
you're going into this cave when you go (51:52 - 51:55)
into the forest the grass gets darker (51:53 - 51:58)
and then it goes into the forest the (51:55 - 52:01)
forest itself has it feels very twisty (51:58 - 52:04)
and you know like mysterious so they did (52:01 - 52:09)
so much texture and color and variation (52:04 - 52:12)
that it really makes the other wild area (52:09 - 52:16)
feel very flat no III and I think that's (52:12 - 52:18)
like the main thing I absolutely agree (52:16 - 52:20)
and it's like the things to me is just (52:18 - 52:23)
like even in that first area besides the (52:20 - 52:26)
fact that yes I was really aggravated (52:23 - 52:30)
that it's the teutuls and dread nas (52:26 - 52:33)
again moving around but it's like that (52:30 - 52:35)
there's little like pawns right and (52:33 - 52:38)
they're not the water features that you (52:35 - 52:40)
can't walk you just walk into the pond (52:38 - 52:42)
and like there's different colored like (52:40 - 52:45)
flower patches and things like that that (52:42 - 52:46)
you can walk around it which is much (52:45 - 52:50)
more like natural look young and it's (52:46 - 52:54)
not you know just the tall grass or the (52:50 - 52:56)
short grass and you know it's just like (52:54 - 53:00)
back and forth the trees do look better (52:56 - 53:01)
- I (53:00 - 53:05)
don't even care enough attention (53:01 - 53:09)
my biggest issue I have two huge issues (53:05 - 53:12)
I haven't gotten that far into I have (53:09 - 53:14)
not completed the story of the DLC so (53:12 - 53:17)
that's not that's just like so that's a (53:14 - 53:21)
limitation on my issue so far but number (53:17 - 53:28)
one that dude Avery who Mari Avery the (53:21 - 53:33)
rival I know no no no no no no whatever (53:28 - 53:37)
that's and I mustered I have no job and (53:33 - 53:42)
I I have the lady rival no yeah far I am (53:37 - 53:46)
walking over to the dojo and this dude (53:42 - 53:51)
runs over he's like oh you found my (53:46 - 53:56)
Diglett you're such a cool guy thank you (53:51 - 53:59)
for helping me out he's like I have a (53:56 - 54:02)
bunch of these a lowland Diglett and I (53:59 - 54:05)
could swear I read him say three and (54:02 - 54:07)
he's like would you help me find them (54:05 - 54:09)
and I'm like sure I'll help you find (54:07 - 54:10)
your three diglettz and he's like I have (54:09 - 54:16)
a hundred and fifty one was it 151 well (54:10 - 54:18)
you find the first one first yeah so you (54:16 - 54:20)
have to find a hundred fifty matter like (54:18 - 54:23)
you jerk I don't want to have to find (54:20 - 54:28)
your dag on diglettz everywhere oh yeah (54:23 - 54:29)
you have me to save your time well (54:28 - 54:32)
don't don't don't find the Diglett no I (54:29 - 54:35)
I'm just aggravated that he was so rude (54:32 - 54:41)
to bother to ask me to find an important (54:35 - 54:46)
second wait second cap layer the spawns (54:41 - 54:50)
when the the wandering Pokemon out in (54:46 - 54:53)
the field pop up they I don't know the (54:50 - 54:55)
right way to put it it's like you don't (54:53 - 54:59)
have enough distance before they pop up (54:55 - 55:03)
and I am running over wooperz left and (54:59 - 55:04)
right cause you're just spawning right (55:03 - 55:08)
under my feet but I will say the best (55:04 - 55:10)
and I was almost going to joke that I (55:08 - 55:13)
have completed the DLC because this is (55:10 - 55:15)
like the only thing I wanted (55:13 - 55:20)
I now have a black bike that sparkles (55:15 - 55:24)
like red flash as I ride it red and (55:20 - 55:28)
black are my colors I already like in (55:24 - 55:31)
the real world have a black bike and now (55:28 - 55:33)
I have a black bike in the game with red (55:31 - 55:36)
sparklies and that's all I ever wanted (55:33 - 55:39)
in Pokemon so I'm thrilled how many (55:36 - 55:41)
hours do you think you put in well like (55:39 - 55:44)
like two three five ah I think I've put (55:41 - 55:46)
in about three hours at this point okay (55:44 - 55:50)
yeah and Greg I think I put in probably (55:46 - 55:53)
ten I was doing a lot of raids so I (55:50 - 55:55)
can't say that that was quality content (55:53 - 55:57)
I say that part of my marking it down is (55:55 - 56:01)
the Diglett thing was interesting as a (55:57 - 56:04)
way to have to explore the island the (56:01 - 56:06)
number was way too high like stop trying (56:04 - 56:09)
to shove it into the gen1 numbering says (56:06 - 56:12)
I love the they love 151 it's it's not (56:09 - 56:15)
interesting and it's way too many like (56:12 - 56:16)
when you're in there and it's like you (56:15 - 56:19)
have 5,000 more to find in this area I'm (56:16 - 56:21)
like I'm not no I'm not going to I'm (56:19 - 56:23)
done I don't want to spoil the reward (56:21 - 56:27)
was for Diglett but if the reward was (56:23 - 56:30)
like a t-shirt that I could wear and (56:27 - 56:32)
that I could show off in like a max rate (56:30 - 56:35)
battle or in a like competitive battle (56:32 - 56:38)
that I did it I think that is a pretty (56:35 - 56:41)
low bar but that is like the low bar I (56:38 - 56:43)
would have expected as the final reward (56:41 - 56:45)
and I think I would have been happy with (56:43 - 56:48)
a shirt but it was not a shirt it was (56:45 - 56:51)
much worse yeah I know what it is I have (56:48 - 56:54)
to agree I'm also surprised that still (56:51 - 56:59)
the other UK dog snubbull and granbull (56:54 - 57:01)
are still not in this game hey there's (56:59 - 57:05)
one more DLC I know but come what really (57:01 - 57:08)
well I think um I think salamence was (57:05 - 57:11)
confirmed and but that second DLC - I (57:08 - 57:13)
mean salabanzi literally a European (57:11 - 57:15)
dragon yeah (57:13 - 57:17)
can we talk about the book Mun that are (57:15 - 57:19)
in the game oh sure I was just gonna say (57:17 - 57:22)
I just for the sake of this conversation (57:19 - 57:25)
I put 30 plus hours into the DLC so far (57:22 - 57:27)
I have completed the Pokedex I've (57:25 - 57:28)
completed the story I (57:27 - 57:31)
found all the diglettz I have almost (57:28 - 57:34)
unlocked everything in the dojo I have (57:31 - 57:37)
purchased every single bit of clothing I (57:34 - 57:41)
feel like in a sense I am done with the (57:37 - 57:44)
DLC of like what you could actually do (57:41 - 57:46)
like I said could be like well I played (57:44 - 57:47)
it for ten hours but I didn't do the (57:46 - 57:49)
Diglett stuff like okay well you (57:47 - 57:50)
technically still have something to do (57:49 - 57:52)
but I mean like if the Diglett stuff (57:50 - 57:55)
isn't fun for you I would not pursue it (57:52 - 57:57)
just to get the reward because I don't (57:55 - 58:00)
think he'd be satisfied but in the sense (57:57 - 58:02)
of like it took me about 30 hours to do (58:00 - 58:05)
everything I feel pretty satisfied and (58:02 - 58:07)
I'm feel pretty pretty happy with it (58:05 - 58:11)
they added a lot of interesting Pokemon (58:07 - 58:14)
that it all existed before I think I was (58:11 - 58:17)
disappointed that there weren't really (58:14 - 58:20)
no new glaring forms oh that is that is (58:17 - 58:22)
for sure that biggest disappointment (58:20 - 58:25)
yeah that that just knowing like playing (58:22 - 58:28)
around and expecting to run into (58:25 - 58:32)
something just a Glary apprising Psyduck (58:28 - 58:36)
or like literally anything like a goal (58:32 - 58:39)
Arian likho Tong since you like you know (58:36 - 58:41)
I don't know one that's wearing a tech (58:39 - 58:43)
seat something the fact that there is (58:41 - 58:46)
just nothing I was like it makes me (58:43 - 58:47)
really worried and though like the (58:46 - 58:49)
second one I'm just now assuming that (58:47 - 58:52)
they showed their hand they they show (58:49 - 58:54)
that they it's Kalei Rex it's it's (58:52 - 58:56)
Reggie Drago and it's cash register they (58:54 - 58:58)
showed their hand there's not gonna be (58:56 - 59:00)
anything else besides that and that's I (58:58 - 59:04)
think that disappointed me just I was (59:00 - 59:06)
expecting I didn't know that I was (59:04 - 59:09)
expecting I was hoping for a surprise (59:06 - 59:12)
one just like one just like one just (59:09 - 59:15)
something something and that didn't (59:12 - 59:20)
happen but they I mean and I'm they (59:15 - 59:22)
implemented a feature that was in other (59:20 - 59:24)
games and they implemented it sort of (59:22 - 59:28)
weird and I mean I think everyone knows (59:24 - 59:30)
by the following Pokemon the following (59:28 - 59:33)
did you know this yeah yeah I've seen it (59:30 - 59:36)
on Twitter it's they did it in a weird (59:33 - 59:39)
way like I don't know you can't see (59:36 - 59:42)
anybody else's you can only see yours (59:39 - 59:45)
and often they don't move fast enough so (59:42 - 59:46)
it always seems like they're just (59:45 - 59:47)
teleporting behind you if you're going (59:46 - 59:50)
fast especially in your bike you don't (59:47 - 59:52)
interacting with them is weird it's just (59:50 - 59:58)
it's that part felt a little tagged on (59:52 - 60:00)
I think in the fact and the fact that a (59:58 - 60:01)
lot of people like oh you can go talk to (60:00 - 60:04)
the Pikachu get to turn that off and a (60:01 - 60:05)
lot of people are like oh thank you for (60:04 - 60:08)
telling me just tells me that it wasn't (60:05 - 60:10)
it wasn't well implemented that a lot of (60:08 - 60:13)
people were expecting something to be as (60:10 - 60:15)
vital as it wasn't like heartgold (60:13 - 60:17)
SoulSilver and so many people are (60:15 - 60:19)
looking for a way to turn it off but in (60:17 - 60:22)
harness over its it's like a (60:19 - 60:25)
significantly easier / smaller thing (60:22 - 60:26)
right because it's like glue to your (60:25 - 60:30)
pixels it yeah it is one square big it (60:26 - 60:32)
moves as fast as like it's so much (60:30 - 60:35)
easier in that game yeah and I'm it's it (60:32 - 60:37)
just it just goes that like all of those (60:35 - 60:39)
people being like I'm not buying the (60:37 - 60:40)
game if they don't have following (60:39 - 60:42)
Pokemon they already copy and pasted (60:40 - 60:43)
everything just copy and paste it again (60:42 - 60:46)
but it's it's not that simple because (60:43 - 60:48)
not because one let's get like look at (60:46 - 60:52)
let's go Kanto is flat there is no Hills (60:48 - 60:55)
there are no ramps there are no is a (60:52 - 60:58)
flat body of land and Galler (60:55 - 61:01)
even if you even yes especially the (60:58 - 61:03)
island armor there are ramps there are (61:01 - 61:05)
stairs there are mountains there are (61:03 - 61:08)
caves there are ups and downs and take a (61:05 - 61:10)
Pokemon like Faye links it looks bad (61:08 - 61:13)
yeah because it doesn't know how to go (61:10 - 61:15)
up and down those stairs because it is (61:13 - 61:17)
it is like a ruler that is following you (61:15 - 61:20)
like I think like it's like a giant tape (61:17 - 61:22)
measure following you and it's just it (61:20 - 61:24)
just proves that like it's not copy and (61:22 - 61:27)
paste like all of these Pokemon or like (61:24 - 61:29)
there are what now yeah almost 600 (61:27 - 61:31)
Pokemon and yeah they have to fix (61:29 - 61:33)
failings they have then the now they (61:31 - 61:35)
have to go back and start fixing these (61:33 - 61:37)
for different environments and I'm sure (61:35 - 61:38)
in future Pokemon games it will be (61:37 - 61:40)
better but it just shows you that like (61:38 - 61:43)
it ain't copy and paste yeah well they (61:40 - 61:47)
did some like a vlog in the water basin (61:43 - 61:48)
in the water like there are so many (61:47 - 61:52)
really cool little moments that you'd (61:48 - 61:54)
think oh for sure this Pokemon who is a (61:52 - 61:57)
water pokemon will be able to also swim (61:54 - 61:58)
and then that doesn't happen (61:57 - 62:01)
yeah like Blastoise can't swim yeah but (61:58 - 62:04)
like yeah but like Avila is really cool (62:01 - 62:07)
in the water Keldeo is it responds how (62:04 - 62:09)
Keldeo should like it runs across the (62:07 - 62:10)
water (62:09 - 62:13)
I'm assuming in in the crown Tundra the (62:10 - 62:15)
same thing happens I'm assuming suicune (62:13 - 62:17)
should also be able to run across the (62:15 - 62:21)
water yep and the thing is is like those (62:17 - 62:24)
moments are cool and they get dulled (62:21 - 62:26)
when you try it with like your favorite (62:24 - 62:29)
Pokemon and it doesn't it doesn't behave (62:26 - 62:32)
how you think it should behave which (62:29 - 62:34)
it's like you took two steps forward (62:32 - 62:36)
because this is a great feature and you (62:34 - 62:37)
did a lot of cool things and then you (62:36 - 62:41)
hurt yourself by having us all step back (62:37 - 62:43)
like Magikarp doesn't swim right or (62:41 - 62:46)
Blastoise doesn't swim at all (62:43 - 62:49)
yeah and it's I think that I think they (62:46 - 62:51)
knew though I think like yeah that is (62:49 - 62:54)
why it didn't they didn't include it in (62:51 - 62:55)
the base game because all of the (62:54 - 62:57)
national Dexter's would have looked at (62:55 - 62:58)
it and been like yeah that was a (62:57 - 63:00)
complaint that was a complaint they hung (62:58 - 63:02)
on to you know they took away following (63:00 - 63:04)
Pokemon again but if they would have put (63:02 - 63:06)
it in all those same people would have (63:04 - 63:08)
been look at how bad this is (63:06 - 63:12)
yeah mm-hmm yeah they wouldn't they what (63:08 - 63:13)
that was it was a lose-lose for Game (63:12 - 63:16)
three it was a lose-lose yeah and I (63:13 - 63:20)
think I think this is mostly a win but (63:16 - 63:24)
it does feel a little off it does feel (63:20 - 63:27)
not completely finished which again this (63:24 - 63:29)
is why I can't say that this that I (63:27 - 63:32)
can't give this like an A+ or an A for (63:29 - 63:33)
the expansion because I think there's a (63:32 - 63:36)
number of things that that take away (63:33 - 63:38)
from the ultimate fun it is still very (63:36 - 63:41)
solid it I am still impressed that they (63:38 - 63:44)
did a DLC that even if you thought I had (63:41 - 63:47)
to pay $30 for this even though you're (63:44 - 63:49)
getting two I still think they got so (63:47 - 63:52)
close to it being worth $30 that you are (63:49 - 63:55)
excited for the next one to come but (63:52 - 63:58)
there are imperfections everywhere it (63:55 - 64:00)
does reflect well I think Jordan Shield (63:58 - 64:02)
has the imperfections yeah there's (64:00 - 64:05)
imperfections everywhere but I think it (64:02 - 64:09)
is mostly a positive experience and I (64:05 - 64:11)
you know I have no problems telling (64:09 - 64:12)
people yeah you should buy it and play (64:11 - 64:14)
it it's fun like Brent SOT you know he's (64:12 - 64:15)
like do I get to play it in this new (64:14 - 64:17)
area cuz he hasn't played Pokemon in a (64:15 - 64:19)
while and he's excited to go there and (64:17 - 64:21)
see all the new textures and and do the (64:19 - 64:24)
few things that he wants to do so it's (64:21 - 64:26)
exciting in that way and I think for (64:24 - 64:29)
their first shot they got very close the (64:26 - 64:32)
things that disappoint me or the story (64:29 - 64:33)
is way too short (64:32 - 64:38)
the Diglett thing is way too long there (64:33 - 64:40)
aren't new glaring forms which is (64:38 - 64:42)
disappointing there are still some (64:40 - 64:45)
striking Pokemon missing I'm thrilled (64:42 - 64:49)
that Dunsparce is there because they (64:45 - 64:53)
listen to me hmm they put my blood (64:49 - 64:56)
crammed everywhere yeah the max raids (64:53 - 64:58)
are there aren't a lot of new ones (64:56 - 65:01)
they're just more variety yeah hoping (64:58 - 65:04)
there'd be some more again mortgage I (65:01 - 65:06)
can to make reforms there aren't I think (65:04 - 65:09)
the zero aura raid is is good the shiny (65:06 - 65:11)
ones hard having pleaded it but that's (65:09 - 65:14)
that started the same you to feel I (65:11 - 65:16)
think that's fun pretty happy with the (65:14 - 65:19)
story it was better than I actually (65:16 - 65:21)
expected it was although it was the (65:19 - 65:25)
exactly the life that expected it to be (65:21 - 65:28)
and I hate to I hate to always hang on (65:25 - 65:31)
complaints but III think this is I think (65:28 - 65:33)
this is a good one that people said you (65:31 - 65:35)
know people grow up with Pokemon and and (65:33 - 65:38)
and they have the nostalgia of you know (65:35 - 65:39)
discovering things for our first time (65:38 - 65:41)
and a pretty common complaint I saw for (65:39 - 65:42)
certain shield and I think it's pretty (65:41 - 65:44)
valid is that people didn't feel like (65:42 - 65:46)
there was a sense of discovery and sword (65:44 - 65:48)
and shield and we we've heard that a lot (65:46 - 65:50)
really probably around X&Y where (65:48 - 65:53)
everything felt very straight and then (65:50 - 65:55)
Sun and Moon you know the the paths were (65:53 - 65:56)
pretty straightforward but the routes (65:55 - 65:58)
between things yeah that's true (65:56 - 66:01)
yeah and I I could maybe definitely (65:58 - 66:04)
agree with those people in sword and (66:01 - 66:06)
shield except like I don't know man when (66:04 - 66:07)
you get to the wild area how do you not (66:06 - 66:09)
have a sense of discovery in that in (66:07 - 66:12)
that sense but in in this I think they I (66:09 - 66:14)
think they nailed a sense of discovery (66:12 - 66:16)
you could you could art you could say (66:14 - 66:19)
like it takes no more than two hours to (66:16 - 66:21)
do the story if you did the story but (66:19 - 66:24)
how could you walk past the new areas of (66:21 - 66:26)
the wild area and not get distracted it (66:24 - 66:29)
took me five hours to get to the Diglett (66:26 - 66:33)
bridge because I was I was like oh that (66:29 - 66:34)
there I see a Diglett so that must be (66:33 - 66:36)
the Diglett guy that I've heard about so (66:34 - 66:37)
I don't want to talk to him yet and then (66:36 - 66:39)
I'm like out in the islands I'm looking (66:37 - 66:42)
at sharpedo's there's a giant whale lord (66:39 - 66:45)
when you start there's like so didn't (66:42 - 66:47)
catch it come back there are so many (66:45 - 66:49)
different ways you can go and the game (66:47 - 66:52)
doesn't force you to go to the dojo I (66:49 - 66:53)
think (66:52 - 66:55)
they nailed that and even when you talk (66:53 - 66:57)
to the Diglett and then you go past the (66:55 - 66:59)
then you get the bike ride away and (66:57 - 67:00)
you're like I don't even want to go into (66:59 - 67:01)
the dojo I want to use this new bike (67:00 - 67:04)
yeah then when you do like part one of (67:01 - 67:06)
the dojo then like new and pcs spawn (67:04 - 67:08)
outside and you're like well I want to (67:06 - 67:10)
talk to these guys I think of anything (67:08 - 67:13)
that the if your complaint was like (67:10 - 67:15)
Pokemon doesn't do there's no sense of (67:13 - 67:17)
discovery anymore I think this DLC is is (67:15 - 67:21)
loaded with that yeah even the like (67:17 - 67:23)
Islands way out behind the towers they (67:21 - 67:27)
they have mints to give you there's the (67:23 - 67:30)
the dig in MA the dig in PHA that you (67:27 - 67:32)
can find and then they test there but (67:30 - 67:36)
they're both sham but they they (67:32 - 67:38)
disappear and then you've got to find (67:36 - 67:40)
them somewhere else which i think is (67:38 - 67:41)
cool instead of just standing there all (67:40 - 67:44)
the time I think they I think they (67:41 - 67:47)
nailed that part of the DLC I think I (67:44 - 67:50)
agree with Greg I was expecting one new (67:47 - 67:52)
Galera inform of an old Pokemon and that (67:50 - 67:56)
was a huge bummer but no no you guys (67:52 - 67:57)
gotta answer this one question for me (67:56 - 68:01)
okay okay when I first got if you're (67:57 - 68:03)
gonna call it the Diglett bridge fine I (68:01 - 68:05)
first got to the Diglett bridge there's (68:03 - 68:09)
this lady standing on there and I go to (68:05 - 68:11)
talk to her and she says man there's so (68:09 - 68:14)
many amazing and wonderful Pokemon that (68:11 - 68:15)
you can see in this world do you want to (68:14 - 68:17)
give me a hundred watts so I can show (68:15 - 68:19)
you one of these amazing Pokemon oh yeah (68:17 - 68:21)
sure I want to see an amazing pokemon (68:19 - 68:26)
and she's like here's a fungus okay fine (68:21 - 68:30)
[Laughter] (68:26 - 68:32)
I want to show you an amazing Pokemon (68:30 - 68:34)
that you've never seen before I'm like (68:32 - 68:38)
yeah show me it's a Dunsparce and I went (68:34 - 68:41)
through the RAM idol the miltank and I (68:38 - 68:44)
wasn't involved and then I was like okay (68:41 - 68:47)
this is like the once a day lady cuz she (68:44 - 68:50)
disappeared what today I went back to (68:47 - 68:53)
the Diglett bridge and she's not there (68:50 - 68:54)
yes she's somewhere else (68:53 - 68:57)
yeah she's somewhere else oh so that's (68:54 - 68:59)
like the the other lady who's like I (68:57 - 69:02)
have Pokemon from another region would (68:59 - 69:03)
you give me (69:02 - 69:07)
garyun yeah what exciting thing are you (69:03 - 69:08)
gonna give me and she gives me a regular (69:07 - 69:11)
mr. yeah yep (69:08 - 69:14)
she wanders around to I will just say (69:11 - 69:16)
one thing I did do a miltank raid and (69:14 - 69:19)
that was disturbing nice look there's (69:16 - 69:22)
nothing nothing dumber than seeing a (69:19 - 69:24)
goofy spawn in the wild and man I was I (69:22 - 69:27)
was pumped no no no I was pop there's (69:24 - 69:29)
nothing dumber than seeing a licky licky (69:27 - 69:32)
licky next one in the wild ok cuz that's (69:29 - 69:34)
good strutting around with his tongue (69:32 - 69:38)
hanging out I thought zark was only in (69:34 - 69:41)
raids no yeah no he he spawn is that I (69:38 - 69:43)
then I ran into one I'm like oh heck (69:41 - 69:46)
sweet it would have been cool if they (69:43 - 69:48)
like he disguised himself as something (69:46 - 69:51)
else but yeah yeah true maybe future (69:48 - 69:54)
games ok so these are some of the (69:51 - 69:55)
features out and lock as you as you (69:54 - 69:57)
progress I don't think they're super (69:55 - 70:00)
spoilery we we kind of said that this (69:57 - 70:03)
DLC was very competitive focus and it is (70:00 - 70:06)
I mean like Hershey vu is a come like (70:03 - 70:10)
straight-up VGC competitive Monde or (70:06 - 70:12)
both singles and doubles I don't know if (70:10 - 70:14)
it will be like top 10 Pokemon because (70:12 - 70:17)
it's I think it's special defense that (70:14 - 70:20)
is actually not that great but all of (70:17 - 70:22)
its move sets are specifically designed (70:20 - 70:29)
to shake up the meta of the game and but (70:22 - 70:32)
they do so much for competitive here so (70:29 - 70:34)
there's a point where you can talk to (70:32 - 70:39)
mustards wife honey and she will arrest (70:34 - 70:39)
her (70:39 - 70:43)
yeah boy she's a she's a she pushes the (70:39 - 70:48)
line of reading between the lines with (70:43 - 70:50)
some of the things she says anyways they (70:48 - 70:52)
they do something in a Pokemon game (70:50 - 70:54)
which kind of done in the past but (70:52 - 70:56)
because I think black and white had an (70:54 - 70:58)
upgrade system but you can upgrade your (70:56 - 71:00)
dojo and you can add new things to the (70:58 - 71:03)
dojo by paying her watts so like a basic (71:00 - 71:05)
one is you can add a salon to the dojo (71:03 - 71:07)
so you can do your hair and right in the (71:05 - 71:10)
salon but one of the closer to endgame (71:07 - 71:14)
things is a vitamin machine so you can (71:10 - 71:16)
upgrade it three times each time is two (71:14 - 71:17)
different vitamins like (71:16 - 71:20)
iron and carbo stand protein and HP up (71:17 - 71:23)
or whatever and not only does it add a (71:20 - 71:27)
vitamin machine right into the dojo that (71:23 - 71:28)
you can walk up to and buy from (71:27 - 71:31)
it adds bulk buying vitamins you can buy (71:28 - 71:33)
one five ten or twenty five not only (71:31 - 71:36)
that is it's discounted for you when you (71:33 - 71:38)
buy them they've they've lowered the bar (71:36 - 71:41)
even more and again it's also a way to (71:38 - 71:44)
and you see this a lot with deal you see (71:41 - 71:46)
this a lot with like third versions like (71:44 - 71:58)
platinum or ultrason ultrasonic you know (71:46 - 72:02)
D axis and auras or all of these other (71:58 - 72:03)
legendaries and ultrasone altra moon (72:02 - 72:06)
like here is something for you for (72:03 - 72:07)
buying the game and here's like the (72:06 - 72:10)
Rotom boost to make experience easier or (72:07 - 72:12)
hatching easier like they do that (72:10 - 72:13)
they've done this in third part that in (72:12 - 72:16)
third game so to do like here if you (72:13 - 72:17)
want to get in the competitive you want (72:16 - 72:19)
to raise your Pokemon not only is this a (72:17 - 72:21)
way to buy bulk vitamins but we're (72:19 - 72:23)
discounting them and they're right here (72:21 - 72:26)
right in this machine right next to like (72:23 - 72:28)
the the vending machine is right next to (72:26 - 72:31)
a dude that will teach you new moves (72:28 - 72:34)
some really interesting moves like I (72:31 - 72:37)
don't do competitive but the fear that (72:34 - 72:40)
I've seen I'm like oh cool that sounds (72:37 - 72:42)
interesting yeah like they added a (72:40 - 72:44)
instead of volts which they added like (72:42 - 72:47)
an aqua switch which is pretty cool and (72:44 - 72:51)
then in the kitchen they have a place (72:47 - 72:53)
for you to buy food for camping but they (72:51 - 72:55)
also have the ability so you can hand in (72:53 - 72:57)
your max mushrooms and your max honey (72:55 - 73:00)
for max soup again another competitive (72:57 - 73:02)
feature of being like you know I caught (73:00 - 73:06)
this five I be perfect gar boater (73:02 - 73:08)
it sucks that I can't use it because (73:06 - 73:11)
it's a I can't Giganta max it but now I (73:08 - 73:15)
can with max soup they've done that they (73:11 - 73:17)
have the dojo in the back which I (73:15 - 73:19)
believe has some more stuff to it and (73:17 - 73:20)
that's that's the part I actually (73:19 - 73:21)
haven't done yet is the you know post (73:20 - 73:25)
dojo stuff that you can do but all of (73:21 - 73:27)
these all of these things geared towards (73:25 - 73:29)
competitive you can find mints on (73:27 - 73:31)
Islands now the cram (73:29 - 73:33)
maduk is pretty good for competitive you (73:31 - 73:35)
can put four rare candies in it to get (73:33 - 73:37)
an ability capsule you can put four (73:35 - 73:39)
bottle caps in it to get a golden bottle (73:37 - 73:39)
cap (73:39 - 73:44)
do not put four golden bottle caps in it (73:39 - 73:44)
disappointed so I don't know if any of I (73:45 - 73:50)
don't know if any of that convinces (73:48 - 73:53)
somebody to get into competitive I think (73:50 - 73:55)
it probably does at like a lower level (73:53 - 74:00)
for people to be like oh okay um maybe I (73:55 - 74:02)
will buy some vitamins maybe I will turn (74:00 - 74:05)
your Pokemon the huge thing oh sorry go (74:02 - 74:05)
ahead (74:05 - 74:07)
I just think that it helps friends who (74:05 - 74:10)
are into competitive guide their friends (74:07 - 74:13)
into getting in competitive like it (74:10 - 74:16)
helps make that entry lower so they (74:13 - 74:17)
could say Oh buy these but like they (74:16 - 74:20)
gain tell them what to do and it seems (74:17 - 74:23)
very doable all in one place instead of (74:20 - 74:25)
flying to like six different towns you (74:23 - 74:26)
get everything like go here and then (74:25 - 74:29)
they go here and they go here the other (74:26 - 74:31)
huge thing that they didn't even talk (74:29 - 74:34)
about and and for I guess we thought (74:31 - 74:35)
they revealed their hand this was cool (74:34 - 74:39)
in the old battle tower in in windin (74:35 - 74:42)
they added a guy he's standing like (74:39 - 74:44)
right by the doors and what he will do (74:42 - 74:47)
is he will look at any of your Pokemon (74:44 - 74:49)
that are not sword and shield and he (74:47 - 74:51)
will make them competitive and battle (74:49 - 74:55)
ready for actual tournaments so if you (74:51 - 74:58)
caught a shiny Charmander in in Ruby and (74:55 - 75:01)
Sapphire and you got a bunch of ribbons (74:58 - 75:04)
on it and he was your bud and you moved (75:01 - 75:05)
him to heartgold SoulSilver and you (75:04 - 75:07)
walked with them and then you moved them (75:05 - 75:10)
into sword and shield after jumping (75:07 - 75:12)
through the hoops of black and white and (75:10 - 75:14)
Pokemon bank and Pokemon home and (75:12 - 75:16)
getting it in the sword and shield you (75:14 - 75:20)
can take a Charmander that you caught in (75:16 - 75:23)
original Ruby you can talk to this guy (75:20 - 75:25)
he will say I want to delete all the (75:23 - 75:28)
moves but in doing so you can use this (75:25 - 75:30)
in competitive battle and he will he (75:28 - 75:33)
will put a new symbol next to the sword (75:30 - 75:34)
and shield symbol next to the shiny (75:33 - 75:37)
symbol in your info and you can now use (75:34 - 75:38)
that Charmander competitively you can (75:37 - 75:40)
even take that Charmander to the area (75:38 - 75:42)
for max soup and you can make that (75:40 - 75:43)
Charmander have the ability to Giganta (75:42 - 75:44)
max (75:43 - 75:46)
that's pretty sweet that's that's (75:44 - 75:51)
unexpected and yes like that just the (75:46 - 75:53)
fact that I can now bring over all those (75:51 - 75:56)
teams that I built when I was doing a (75:53 - 75:58)
lot of competitive stuff and just have (75:56 - 76:01)
them for fun and everything I that I'm (75:58 - 76:04)
very excited like I built two completely (76:01 - 76:07)
shiny completely ready teams in ultra (76:04 - 76:09)
Sun ultra moon and it was fun to build (76:07 - 76:11)
them and it was fun to breed for them (76:09 - 76:14)
and it was fun to SOS for them and I had (76:11 - 76:15)
definitely had more fun building the (76:14 - 76:18)
team than doing the battles but like the (76:15 - 76:20)
one Pokemon I would want to use is the (76:18 - 76:22)
like the shiny Litton in a sinner or (76:20 - 76:24)
that I bred for ultra Sun all ultra moon (76:22 - 76:25)
and I was like oh okay well you know I (76:24 - 76:27)
guess I can just use a regular in center (76:25 - 76:28)
or this time I don't need to go through (76:27 - 76:30)
all the work to breed another shiny and (76:28 - 76:33)
sinner or that's fine I already have one (76:30 - 76:36)
but now I can take that one I can delete (76:33 - 76:37)
all the moves I can get the little (76:36 - 76:40)
symbol I can now get that ribbon on that (76:37 - 76:44)
in sin Aurora in the master or the sorry (76:40 - 76:46)
the ranked battle ribbon it's such a (76:44 - 76:50)
cool feature that they didn't talk about (76:46 - 76:52)
they didn't show it even during they (76:50 - 76:54)
they just didn't tell anyone (76:52 - 76:56)
it was literally somebody discovered it (76:54 - 76:59)
posted it on social media and then (76:56 - 77:00)
everyone else was like oh my gosh look (76:59 - 77:03)
at this feature this is cool (77:00 - 77:06)
and again it just kind of piggybacks on (77:03 - 77:09)
this whole dlc being very I mean look (77:06 - 77:11)
there's lots of things to do but the the (77:09 - 77:13)
core of it was you know developing your (77:11 - 77:16)
teams and and you know getting more more (77:13 - 77:21)
battle-ready stuff but there there's I'm (77:16 - 77:23)
very happy with the DLC I don't think (77:21 - 77:26)
it's perfect but I was I was very (77:23 - 77:29)
worried based on DLCs of other games (77:26 - 77:33)
that this was very easy for Game Freak (77:29 - 77:34)
to mess up and I don't think they did (77:33 - 77:36)
and some of the new clothes are super (77:34 - 77:38)
sweet I feel like the clothes alone are (77:36 - 77:41)
worth the 15 bucks I so don't I'm still (77:38 - 77:46)
wearing my gray hoodie whole three-piece (77:41 - 77:51)
suit in the DLC I wear hoodies you can (77:46 - 77:53)
get a whole black suit you can be (77:51 - 77:55)
business will (77:53 - 77:57)
not gonna happen I don't poke him on (77:55 - 78:01)
battle in a suit you can get a hot pink (77:57 - 78:05)
suit coat a black turtleneck and hot (78:01 - 78:08)
pink suit pants you can get in and be (78:05 - 78:10)
the super gay Steve Jobs of the gallery (78:08 - 78:12)
you can get at home you can get a choker (78:10 - 78:15)
if you're into that yeah no wait (78:12 - 78:17)
Craig didn't you wear a pink suit for (78:15 - 78:19)
your wedding I did (78:17 - 78:22)
well there you go that's your deal if it (78:19 - 78:25)
wasn't hot pink no okay I am I am (78:22 - 78:28)
wearing the punk pink vest right now (78:25 - 78:31)
with the ultra ball guy shirt and the (78:28 - 78:35)
collar there and I got and I got I got (78:31 - 78:37)
chairman roses hair for a while (78:35 - 78:39)
because it doesn't look bad I was (78:37 - 78:43)
disappointed in the spiked Mohawk color (78:39 - 78:44)
right coloring because I was gonna do (78:43 - 78:46)
that but I didn't like how the colors (78:44 - 78:46)
looked (78:46 - 78:48)
yeah they added three new hairstyles for (78:46 - 78:51)
the boys yeah did they add shield Burt (78:48 - 78:55)
and sortie on no hopefully cross over (78:51 - 78:58)
hopefully crown Tundra I'm so mad (78:55 - 79:01)
they added man bun yeah they added the (78:58 - 79:05)
donate force that on you would you (79:01 - 79:10)
what you put the the dojo uniform on my (79:05 - 79:13)
hair is changed just to talk about this (79:10 - 79:16)
IGN casey from IGN she was the one that (79:13 - 79:18)
reviewed sword and shield originally i (79:16 - 79:20)
think she gave it like an 8 out of 10 or (79:18 - 79:22)
something if i remember she was able to (79:20 - 79:24)
play the dlc 30 minutes early on monday (79:22 - 79:27)
and apparently she asked nintendo if the (79:24 - 79:29)
game scales with your level and nintendo (79:27 - 79:34)
said yes and that was it and I looked at (79:29 - 79:37)
that tweet and I was like mm I don't (79:34 - 79:38)
know if this means what people think it (79:37 - 79:42)
means but people were like all week on (79:38 - 79:44)
Twitch not all week the two days before (79:42 - 79:47)
the DLC came out people were like what (79:44 - 79:49)
team do you plan on going with and I was (79:47 - 79:51)
like what do you mean and they were like (79:49 - 79:53)
well Nintendo said that it scales levels (79:51 - 79:55)
so what what six Pokemon are you (79:53 - 79:56)
bringing and I was like I'm just (79:55 - 79:58)
probably gonna bring my level 100 shiny (79:56 - 80:00)
cram around and nothing else because (79:58 - 80:03)
didn't pokemons not a hard game but yeah (80:00 - 80:05)
yeah I'm there with you they're like (80:03 - 80:07)
well they said it's going to scale so (80:05 - 80:09)
everything you're gonna see is level 100 (80:07 - 80:10)
but I was like I don't think so because (80:09 - 80:12)
do we know what it means or can I (80:10 - 80:15)
speculate no we do know what it means (80:12 - 80:18)
what it means is if you do not be Leon (80:15 - 80:21)
the DLC accepts that you have not beaten (80:18 - 80:23)
the game so when you go into the DLC (80:21 - 80:27)
everything is level 20 yup okay and if (80:23 - 80:29)
you know do you beat Leon when you go (80:27 - 80:32)
into the DLC everything starts at 62 and (80:29 - 80:35)
then goes up to I think the final (80:32 - 80:39)
hardest thing I thought was like 78 yeah (80:35 - 80:42)
so true the whole wild area farce again (80:39 - 80:44)
oh we're not gonna tell you this but if (80:42 - 80:46)
you pass this trigger everything's going (80:44 - 80:48)
to jump in level yeah so you could (80:46 - 80:51)
ideally purchase sword and shield make (80:48 - 80:54)
it to the wild area by the time you get (80:51 - 80:56)
to the wild area you should be about (80:54 - 80:58)
fifteen sixteen seventeen because Milo I (80:56 - 81:00)
think is eighteen and twenty and then (80:58 - 81:02)
instead of going to Milo you could go to (81:00 - 81:04)
the island of armor and experience all (81:02 - 81:06)
that content and I think that is a good (81:04 - 81:07)
way to do it (81:06 - 81:10)
mm-hm and myself I'm not disappointed or (81:07 - 81:13)
upset I don't want to fight or catch (81:10 - 81:17)
level 100 Pokemon like like I cheated I (81:13 - 81:19)
just don't wanna like fate because that (81:17 - 81:21)
means like if a Pokemon is a higher (81:19 - 81:23)
level than you it's harder to run away (81:21 - 81:24)
and it's harder to catch it and I don't (81:23 - 81:27)
want to deal with that and there are (81:24 - 81:30)
barely any trainers to fight in this DLC (81:27 - 81:35)
besides specific dojo stuff and making (81:30 - 81:38)
those dojo Pokemon level 100 does it (81:35 - 81:40)
make it harder it just means instead of (81:38 - 81:41)
me one-shotting them I probably have to (81:40 - 81:45)
2-shot them like that's all it does I'm (81:41 - 81:50)
sure that is a minor gripe that people (81:45 - 81:54)
had but there has to be yeah do you do (81:50 - 81:56)
you actually want to play a Pokemon game (81:54 - 81:58)
where you have to have level 100's on (81:56 - 82:01)
your team just to navigate the world (81:58 - 82:06)
uh I don't know no I think I think them (82:01 - 82:07)
being at sixty is fine (82:06 - 82:09)
they give you the experience charm right (82:07 - 82:11)
away and all that all that means is (82:09 - 82:12)
you're getting more experience per catch (82:11 - 82:15)
or per defeat so again another quality (82:12 - 82:18)
of life it's almost like a built-in roto (82:15 - 82:22)
it's literally a built-in roto XP for (82:18 - 82:24)
this game yeah if you complete the (82:22 - 82:28)
pokédex we talked about this but you'll (82:24 - 82:30)
get the mark charm I think the one of (82:28 - 82:33)
the data miners said that ideally to get (82:30 - 82:35)
a rare mark is like one in five so to (82:33 - 82:37)
get the rarest mark is one in a thousand (82:35 - 82:41)
to get a I think they called it a like a (82:37 - 82:44)
social mark like like not the so not the (82:41 - 82:46)
actual social mark but like the more (82:44 - 82:48)
rare marks that aren't the rare mark (82:46 - 82:52)
it's like 1 in 500 and then like the (82:48 - 82:54)
morning slash dusts clash night mark (82:52 - 82:56)
that you can get is like 1 in 50 and (82:54 - 82:59)
then the uncommon mark the mark that is (82:56 - 83:02)
actually common is like 1 in 25 (82:59 - 83:05)
so anyways they posted the the chance of (83:02 - 83:07)
getting a mark and the mark charm just (83:05 - 83:10)
is like the shiny charm it just adds +2 (83:07 - 83:13)
so instead of 1 in 25 or one in a (83:10 - 83:16)
thousand it's 3 + 25 or 3 and a thousand (83:13 - 83:18)
so that's all that does if you want to (83:16 - 83:21)
complete that pokedex you do get another (83:18 - 83:23)
stamp on your trainer card to of (83:21 - 83:27)
completing the armor the isle of armor (83:23 - 83:31)
pokedex so a lot of things to work for (83:27 - 83:35)
in the dlc but i think i think it's good (83:31 - 83:38)
and i think it i think of anything it (83:35 - 83:40)
also sets my expectations for the next (83:38 - 83:43)
one like I can't imagine the crown (83:40 - 83:46)
Tundra to be bigger although if it's the (83:43 - 83:48)
same size or slightly smaller I think (83:46 - 83:51)
that's awesome because I think the (83:48 - 83:52)
island of armors a lot bigger than we (83:51 - 83:55)
expected and I guess I'm not expecting (83:52 - 83:57)
any new Pokemon because or any new (83:55 - 83:59)
gallery' informs because this DLC didn't (83:57 - 84:00)
come with any but if there is that would (83:59 - 84:03)
be pleasant but I'm not gonna expect it (84:00 - 84:05)
you never know never never know you (84:03 - 84:07)
never know but I think it's good I think (84:05 - 84:09)
I think (84:07 - 84:11)
they did it I think this is better than (84:09 - 84:14)
a third version by far (84:11 - 84:16)
I love me my third friction so I'm not (84:14 - 84:21)
gonna go in that mark yeah let me see (84:16 - 84:23)
the other half and then I'll make my (84:21 - 84:25)
statement on whether I would have rather (84:23 - 84:29)
have seen a third version hmm yeah I (84:25 - 84:31)
feel like this is this is it for me as (84:29 - 84:33)
somebody who has like 100 plus bottle (84:31 - 84:40)
caps and Oh grand all those items though (84:33 - 84:42)
they also we didn't talk about this they (84:40 - 84:44)
also make you use your watts so as (84:42 - 84:46)
somebody who was who I was I had 2.5 (84:44 - 84:49)
million watts and I was hoarding them (84:46 - 84:50)
and people were like what are you gonna (84:49 - 84:52)
do with them I was like I don't know yet (84:50 - 84:54)
I just I just want them I don't (84:52 - 84:59)
understand why mr. and mrs. mustards son (84:54 - 85:03)
is like I need 500 watts to get this (84:59 - 85:07)
garbage can with a beak to operate but (85:03 - 85:10)
that's far too men like dude all you (85:07 - 85:14)
need to do is walk up to three dead what (85:10 - 85:19)
are you that early three outside of your (85:14 - 85:22)
door door okay hold up before we talk (85:19 - 85:23)
about the cran BOTS that's the last (85:22 - 85:26)
thing we got to talk about the game does (85:23 - 85:30)
make you use those watts for the dojo (85:26 - 85:34)
and I think that's good and there's a (85:30 - 85:37)
and and they do good of making it easy (85:34 - 85:40)
to get other items slash give you a way (85:37 - 85:42)
to throw away items that you don't need (85:40 - 85:46)
anymore into the cran box so I felt like (85:42 - 85:47)
sword and shield did have a currency (85:46 - 85:49)
problem of like what am I gonna do that (85:47 - 85:51)
guy literally done it like I could spend (85:49 - 85:53)
these watts I guess on luxury balls and (85:51 - 85:54)
I can sell these luxury balls for money (85:53 - 85:57)
I can use them down to my vitamin C's (85:54 - 86:00)
you use like I do not have 2.5 million (85:57 - 86:03)
watts well look that hi honey needs a (86:00 - 86:06)
lot of watts to upgrade that dojo so you (86:03 - 86:07)
gotta you guys start grinding (86:06 - 86:09)
but the watt but like getting watts (86:07 - 86:11)
encourages you to do raids encourages (86:09 - 86:14)
you to explore like the true they are (86:11 - 86:16)
trying to get this cycle of balance of (86:14 - 86:19)
well if I'm going out to this island to (86:16 - 86:21)
get the Watts I can also get a mint out (86:19 - 86:23)
here I can also shake a tree (86:21 - 86:27)
mmm-hmm that was something that I did (86:23 - 86:28)
every day and sword and shield and I (86:27 - 86:30)
know I'm an exception but when people (86:28 - 86:32)
came into my stream and they're like how (86:30 - 86:33)
do you have five hundred Perry's how do (86:32 - 86:35)
you have two million watts it's like (86:33 - 86:38)
that's that's my first 10 minutes of my (86:35 - 86:40)
stream is I just check all the trees (86:38 - 86:43)
check all the dens and then at the end (86:40 - 86:44)
of stream I do the same thing and that's (86:43 - 86:49)
just the habit I got into and now I'm (86:44 - 86:53)
exhausted in watts but in the I love (86:49 - 86:56)
Armour not only do they make that not (86:53 - 86:58)
only does it make that circle of you (86:56 - 87:02)
know tasks you have to do make a little (86:58 - 87:04)
bit more sense but they also scattered (87:02 - 87:05)
you know items that you would want to (87:04 - 87:07)
collect like the mints on the ground out (87:05 - 87:10)
in the islands and stuff so they're (87:07 - 87:14)
somewhat balancing their economy which i (87:10 - 87:17)
think is hard to do in any game cram o (87:14 - 87:17)
matic (87:17 - 87:20)
or I call it the scam o matic scam you (87:17 - 87:24)
attic gam scam scam buddy scam scam APRA (87:20 - 87:29)
cornballs returned there here uh did (87:24 - 87:31)
they and done that yet (87:29 - 87:33)
remember when we were like let's set (87:31 - 87:35)
expectations for this but I don't know (87:33 - 87:36)
there was a bunch of people that thought (87:35 - 87:38)
they were gonna be sitting in a bathtub (87:36 - 87:41)
of friend balls because of this (87:38 - 87:44)
expansion and it doesn't seem to be the (87:41 - 87:48)
case scam o matic can turn four items (87:44 - 87:51)
into an item protip get a pro controller (87:48 - 87:53)
or sorry get a turbo controller and (87:51 - 87:55)
start handing in your Dynomax candy if (87:53 - 87:57)
you can't sell it and you can't throw it (87:55 - 87:58)
away and if you're gonna be doing a (87:57 - 88:00)
bunch of raids you're gonna get more (87:58 - 88:03)
than max candy I think for Dynomax candy (88:00 - 88:06)
is one dragon Fang and then I think one (88:03 - 88:08)
dragon Fang and two Dynomax candy is a (88:06 - 88:11)
wishing piece so you can grind that out (88:08 - 88:13)
there's there's some there's some avi (88:11 - 88:16)
there's some nice combinations like form (88:13 - 88:19)
little mushrooms is one big mushroom and (88:16 - 88:20)
a big mushroom sells for like four times (88:19 - 88:23)
the price so you'd want to convert those (88:20 - 88:27)
before you sell them but (88:23 - 88:32)
while a lot of things have formulas like (88:27 - 88:35)
flame or dubious disk rare candy like (88:32 - 88:38)
there are formulas for these things some (88:35 - 88:40)
do not have formulas that are guaranteed (88:38 - 88:43)
like the APRA corn balls so I have put (88:40 - 88:47)
in probably 20 plus APRA corns into the (88:43 - 88:48)
scam o matic (88:47 - 88:51)
and i have not gotten the best thing i (88:48 - 88:54)
got was a great ball in return yep it is (88:51 - 88:57)
possible to get love balls and fred (88:54 - 88:59)
balls and even safari ball is possible (88:57 - 89:03)
but it seems to be random no matter what (88:59 - 89:06)
APRA corns you put in it doesn't (89:03 - 89:10)
guarantee anything my question is i walk (89:06 - 89:12)
what is mini mustard what what's his (89:10 - 89:18)
name does he have a first name no (89:12 - 89:25)
mustard his name is hyde hy de hide (89:18 - 89:28)
mustard okay so i went up to him and (89:25 - 89:30)
he's like would you give me a hundred (89:28 - 89:31)
watts to get a recipe and I was like (89:30 - 89:34)
sure and then he gave me a recipe and it (89:31 - 89:38)
was nothing I wanted but fine (89:34 - 89:40)
is that written down though or me any (89:38 - 89:42)
lower or was I supposed to be writing (89:40 - 89:45)
that down while he came down oh good (89:42 - 89:47)
gracious there was a waste of a hundred (89:45 - 89:49)
watts right oh don't worry well I did it (89:47 - 89:51)
about 30 times in a row because I (89:49 - 89:53)
thought it was animal crossing and I was (89:51 - 89:55)
like oh I'm gonna stock up on these (89:53 - 90:02)
recipes oh no remember the ball embelove (89:55 - 90:05)
DIY card with an acorn ah yeah I was (90:02 - 90:08)
open I was open (90:05 - 90:08)
haha (90:09 - 90:11)
get rekt Pokemon loves adding they're (90:12 - 90:19)
like extremely nerdy computer character (90:16 - 90:22)
and PC in their games they really love (90:19 - 90:25)
that trope some something about it but (90:22 - 90:29)
it's like so I mean I did the schematic (90:25 - 90:33)
once and I was just like I all right so (90:29 - 90:38)
my daily tradition now is when I first (90:33 - 90:40)
wake up in the morning and I go and I (90:38 - 90:44)
have my coffee and I play sword and I (90:40 - 90:48)
always start in what is the village (90:44 - 90:49)
that's all the way on the west side (90:48 - 90:51)
where they had this don't mural before (90:49 - 90:53)
it got destroyed and the statues was (90:51 - 90:56)
hiding behind it that town stone sigh (90:53 - 90:59)
yeah yeah and then as the so the first (90:56 - 91:00)
things I walk up to the guy he's like I (90:59 - 91:02)
want to buy something and it's like well (91:00 - 91:04)
I probably have it for you to buy and (91:02 - 91:05)
then I sell it to him and get some money (91:04 - 91:06)
and then I walked to the next guy and (91:05 - 91:07)
he's like I want to sell you something (91:06 - 91:09)
and it's like I buy it I don't even care (91:07 - 91:11)
how many of them I have it especially (91:09 - 91:13)
since they announced achromatic I'm like (91:11 - 91:14)
I'm buying them all because I'm just (91:13 - 91:16)
gonna throw them all away (91:14 - 91:19)
so anyways I have a bunch of extras of (91:16 - 91:22)
sharp beaks and black sludge and (91:19 - 91:25)
whatever you have you Reaper cloths has (91:22 - 91:28)
ones like eggs like alright here's four (91:25 - 91:30)
things where I have extras I'll throw (91:28 - 91:33)
them in the chromatic and blingy block (91:30 - 91:36)
it pops out a little glowy ball and then (91:33 - 91:44)
it says you got a satchel no no this is (91:36 - 91:46)
the thought that I immediately had (91:44 - 91:47)
because this is like the one time I used (91:46 - 91:51)
it that's the one thing I got and Steve (91:47 - 91:53)
you cursed me because that's literally (91:51 - 91:55)
what you said last week was I hope it (91:53 - 92:03)
doesn't give me a satchel I mean I want (91:55 - 92:05)
the listeners to go back to last week's (92:03 - 92:07)
episode and find that moment because (92:05 - 92:08)
it's so true (92:07 - 92:12)
and it's so like I don't even want to (92:08 - 92:15)
touch that thing anymore I put in for (92:12 - 92:17)
rare bones and got a wishing piece hey (92:15 - 92:20)
there you go I mean the the cram o matic (92:17 - 92:24)
is no Kurt Kurt knows how to craft a (92:20 - 92:26)
quality pokeball (92:24 - 92:28)
the cram o matic does not so putting (92:26 - 92:31)
four black peppercorns in you know (92:28 - 92:33)
you're probably gonna get timer ball (92:31 - 92:35)
ninety-nine times at a hundred and then (92:33 - 92:37)
maybe get a safari ball or something and (92:35 - 92:41)
there are no recipes for for APRA corns (92:37 - 92:44)
it seems like pudding for a / corns is (92:41 - 92:47)
the way to get a nap record ball but it (92:44 - 92:50)
I seen hide says that he says if you put (92:47 - 92:54)
four APRA corns in you'll get it all but (92:50 - 92:56)
yeah it seems random and I just don't (92:54 - 92:59)
like I think it's fine I mean like they (92:56 - 93:02)
don't think it's fine what is that they (92:59 - 93:05)
want these pokeballs to be rare yet you (93:02 - 93:09)
still have to put four in of a kind but (93:05 - 93:11)
you can't wait seven from a tree when (93:09 - 93:13)
you shake it yeah well if you're lucky (93:11 - 93:18)
and a variety of colors if you had to (93:13 - 93:20)
put in four of one color to get that one (93:18 - 93:22)
ball you're gonna burn through those (93:20 - 93:25)
things pretty quick you know I honestly (93:22 - 93:27)
think the crema maddox not about the (93:25 - 93:30)
APRA corns that that's that is like the (93:27 - 93:33)
second or like they add on I honestly (93:30 - 93:36)
think that in sword and shield (93:33 - 93:40)
they made it too easy to get those kinds (93:36 - 93:42)
of held items battle items and they're (93:40 - 93:44)
like we've got to find a way for people (93:42 - 93:46)
to be able to offload these and this (93:44 - 93:48)
this is their solution to that and then (93:46 - 93:50)
they're like oh well now we've got this (93:48 - 93:51)
let's do a pre-chorus to and get all (93:50 - 93:54)
those fools who are in love rap with a (93:51 - 93:56)
procore n--'s to buy our deal to see cuz (93:54 - 93:57)
they think they're gonna get something (93:56 - 94:00)
good and we said this on the show before (93:57 - 94:02)
but like they they clearly understand (94:00 - 94:04)
that people love these pokeballs they (94:02 - 94:06)
don't include them in every game they've (94:04 - 94:08)
they've given away these APRA corn balls (94:06 - 94:11)
as like downloads of like mystery gifts (94:08 - 94:15)
and people go nuts for them they're like (94:11 - 94:16)
I want that I don't even care about the (94:15 - 94:19)
gallery' and Pony - I want the one bonus (94:16 - 94:22)
love ball and lore ball I get like to me (94:19 - 94:23)
it seems like they just want to keep (94:22 - 94:27)
them semi special and make them rare in (94:23 - 94:29)
the case of like you know if you if you (94:27 - 94:30)
shook every tree every day you're (94:29 - 94:32)
probably gonna have like 40 APRA corns (94:30 - 94:34)
maybe not all the same colors but if (94:32 - 94:37)
that's giving if whatever the ratio is (94:34 - 94:38)
we don't know if it's like a one in ten (94:37 - 94:40)
chance of one in 20 chance of 100 (94:38 - 94:42)
if you're walking away with one or two a (94:40 - 94:44)
day I think that's pretty good and it's (94:42 - 94:46)
still keeping it rare and it just goes (94:44 - 94:50)
back to like it is not exciting to get (94:46 - 94:52)
droopy and wonder trade it or it's not (94:50 - 94:54)
exciting to get Dunsparce and wonder (94:52 - 94:58)
trade it is exciting to get like oh man (94:54 - 95:00)
I don't really like Dunsparce that much (94:58 - 95:02)
but I got a Dunsparce and a fastball (95:00 - 95:04)
that's actually pretty cool like that's (95:02 - 95:06)
that's like the only thing that's at (95:04 - 95:08)
this point I feel like encouraging (95:06 - 95:12)
trading is is once you catch all the (95:08 - 95:13)
Pokemon now it's like well I don't have (95:12 - 95:15)
the Pokemon in my favorite pokeball and (95:13 - 95:18)
my favorite pokeball is friend ball or (95:15 - 95:19)
something (95:18 - 95:20)
well you know it's an easy thing to do (95:19 - 95:22)
make it so that we can change the (95:20 - 95:24)
pokeball our Pokemon is in come on (95:22 - 95:28)
tundra come on count under at least for (95:24 - 95:30)
the ones that are a gift that come in a (95:28 - 95:34)
boring old pokeball let me put it into (95:30 - 95:35)
the brief and breeding center and say (95:34 - 95:39)
was in there could you just swap out (95:35 - 95:43)
just thanks umm I think that the app (95:39 - 95:46)
recording things just it's an artificial (95:43 - 95:49)
limit I think if you could get a (95:46 - 95:51)
guaranteed one or two a per cornballs a (95:49 - 95:54)
day you would have a lot of people since (95:51 - 95:56)
they see it so special engaging in your (95:54 - 95:59)
game everyday as it is it's a it's a (95:56 - 96:02)
gambling thing and only gamblers are (95:59 - 96:04)
gonna like that and everybody else be (96:02 - 96:06)
like we don't we don't we don't know if (96:04 - 96:07)
there's a better way to do it though (96:06 - 96:09)
because he doesn't tell us the formula (96:07 - 96:12)
so if you know in like a week you know (96:09 - 96:13)
Bulbul PD or something says like (96:12 - 96:15)
actually putting four of the same color (96:13 - 96:18)
is less of a chance and if you put three (96:15 - 96:19)
black in one white it's a better chance (96:18 - 96:21)
like we don't we don't know if that's (96:19 - 96:24)
the case at this point so I think we I (96:21 - 96:26)
think we just gotta wait on that I mean (96:24 - 96:29)
keep in mind it took people almost a (96:26 - 96:31)
full month I think it took three weeks (96:29 - 96:33)
to figure out actually how wormhole (96:31 - 96:37)
worked so I think we just maybe need a (96:33 - 96:40)
little bit more time the scam o matic (96:37 - 96:42)
does do good things though like the (96:40 - 96:43)
mushrooms - the big mushroom is a (96:42 - 96:45)
positive getting rid of your Dynomax (96:43 - 96:48)
candy is a positive for rare candy into (96:45 - 96:52)
ability or ability capsule positive for (96:48 - 96:55)
bottle caps into a golden bog cap super (96:52 - 96:58)
big positive like they're like it's the (96:55 - 97:00)
the whole the whole robot is not a lost (96:58 - 97:02)
cause (97:00 - 97:08)
almost it's almost Alaska but again that (97:02 - 97:09)
that that also helps people (97:08 - 97:11)
competitively right you know you you (97:09 - 97:12)
know as a competitive battler you (97:11 - 97:14)
probably don't need your rare candy you (97:12 - 97:16)
just need only be level 50 you need you (97:14 - 97:18)
probably want the ability capsule or you (97:16 - 97:22)
probably want the golden bottle cap more (97:18 - 97:27)
so there are defined formulas well in (97:22 - 97:31)
support of competitive again yeah but if (97:27 - 97:33)
okay so if you're not in competitive if (97:31 - 97:34)
you have to dig let's stuff to do you (97:33 - 97:38)
have the entire wild area to do which i (97:34 - 97:40)
think is a huge i don't think that's a (97:38 - 97:42)
huge positi one complaining about this (97:40 - 97:44)
new whale wow there is more more pokemon (97:42 - 97:46)
to find and catch heck it's better than (97:44 - 97:49)
the new pokemon snap where it's just (97:46 - 97:53)
fine to take a picture of it um I'm (97:49 - 97:55)
curious you have the story to do I'm (97:53 - 97:58)
curious if they I think the the thing (97:55 - 98:00)
that they could do that they won't do (97:58 - 98:03)
but the thing that they could do is they (98:00 - 98:08)
could say like hey this summer as we're (98:03 - 98:10)
waiting between these two DLCs now (98:08 - 98:12)
because I don't think there's enough (98:10 - 98:17)
content in the DLC to take us into fall (98:12 - 98:19)
I really don't I think there's enough (98:17 - 98:22)
Conville there's an immune I think (98:19 - 98:24)
you'll see the change in the (98:22 - 98:27)
competition's is what we get as our bat (98:24 - 98:30)
content and yeah maybe like the (98:27 - 98:33)
engagement there right I mean like if we (98:30 - 98:35)
were going from like Sun and Moon to (98:33 - 98:37)
ultra Sun and Moon you know most people (98:35 - 98:39)
fell off Sun and Moon or even let's go (98:37 - 98:40)
most people fell off both those games (98:39 - 98:42)
they came out in November they fell off (98:40 - 98:45)
I would say February March and then (98:42 - 98:47)
there was nothing to do so we're very (98:45 - 98:49)
lucky that sword and shield has been (98:47 - 98:52)
somewhat of a living game they have (98:49 - 98:54)
rotated raids out every month they have (98:52 - 98:58)
done quite a few mystery gifts and now (98:54 - 99:01)
they gave us this DLC but I can't help (98:58 - 99:04)
but think like why go back to the old (99:01 - 99:06)
wild area when this wild area is more (99:04 - 99:08)
fun to explore and maybe it's because (99:06 - 99:09)
it's like we're still in the honeymoon (99:08 - 99:12)
period of it but I feel like the thing (99:09 - 99:13)
they could do (99:12 - 99:16)
is update the old wild area or update (99:13 - 99:19)
the original Galler to you know make (99:16 - 99:21)
that while it might change the spawns of (99:19 - 99:23)
the wild area fix the trees or whatever (99:21 - 99:27)
something silly make Pokemon follow you (99:23 - 99:31)
as like a free update to everyone to not (99:27 - 99:34)
only push more people to the DLC to be (99:31 - 99:36)
like hey look come back to the game for (99:34 - 99:38)
free we've did this free update and tons (99:36 - 99:40)
up Nintendo games do this tons of like (99:38 - 99:44)
splatoon Super Mario maker those are the (99:40 - 99:46)
only two that come to mind but they have (99:44 - 99:48)
these free updates that people can come (99:46 - 99:52)
back to to explore and then also push (99:48 - 99:55)
their $30 DLC like there is still (99:52 - 99:57)
whether or not there's a new game next (99:55 - 100:00)
year or next month or in two weeks they (99:57 - 100:03)
still have there they're still not done (100:00 - 100:05)
with the current product which is this (100:03 - 100:07)
$30 package that they need to continue (100:05 - 100:11)
to push into the holidays to sell right (100:07 - 100:13)
like they got one half done they're not (100:11 - 100:15)
going to not market the other half until (100:13 - 100:18)
it's shipped like they want to sell this (100:15 - 100:20)
into the holidays so I think that I (100:18 - 100:21)
think that's more of a goodwill thing if (100:20 - 100:24)
anything to be like hey (100:21 - 100:26)
we're updating some features we're (100:24 - 100:29)
fixing some issues come back to the game (100:26 - 100:32)
for free and if you're interested we're (100:29 - 100:35)
advertising the DLC in the menu I don't (100:32 - 100:36)
know if though they'll do that I doubt (100:35 - 100:40)
it but I think I still think there's a (100:36 - 100:42)
little bit of goodwill they can do for (100:40 - 100:45)
players who players who are still on the (100:42 - 100:48)
fence and I'm sure there's lots of them (100:45 - 100:49)
out there and I'm not talking about the (100:48 - 100:50)
National dexter's they're not in the (100:49 - 100:52)
fence there they could they could say (100:50 - 100:54)
every Pokemon is coming back they're all (100:52 - 100:56)
following you and we've put the best (100:54 - 100:57)
tree graphics in the world on these (100:56 - 100:58)
games those players are still not going (100:57 - 101:00)
to purchase the game but there are (100:58 - 101:02)
plenty of players that will walk into (101:00 - 101:05)
the store this November they just got a (101:02 - 101:07)
switch or they're getting a switch and (101:05 - 101:10)
they're like I like Pokemon I heard this (101:07 - 101:11)
game was pretty okay and then I'll (101:10 - 101:13)
purchase it I heard they added a robot (101:11 - 101:17)
that scams you I'm into this I'm in AI I (101:13 - 101:20)
liked being scammed and I want to give (101:17 - 101:23)
it all my best items to get a worse item (101:20 - 101:24)
back (101:23 - 101:29)
hey I got 164 moonstones see what that (101:24 - 101:31)
cream gives me and I do have those (101:29 - 101:34)
slowly tough get a Wigglytuff army (101:31 - 101:36)
coming let's see what that cream gives (101:34 - 101:39)
me shout out to drew for bringing up the (101:36 - 101:43)
NPC in the battle tower almost forgot it (101:39 - 101:45)
but it was in the Attic channel here (101:43 - 101:47)
well we'll hold off on question the week (101:45 - 101:51)
I think we talked enough today so will (101:47 - 101:53)
give us our Pokemon of the week (101:51 - 101:55)
alright last week's Pokemon of the week (101:53 - 101:58)
was based on the very popular Pokemon (101:55 - 102:00)
Trading Card Game (101:58 - 102:02)
so folks who are familiar with the (102:00 - 102:05)
Pokemon Trading Card Game would have had (102:02 - 102:07)
an advantage knowing about things like (102:05 - 102:09)
Pokemon that have to evolve because (102:07 - 102:13)
their stage basics and stage ones and (102:09 - 102:16)
stage twos and and how that works and (102:13 - 102:20)
this particular Pokemon had a one attack (102:16 - 102:23)
called for one fire energy called Super (102:20 - 102:26)
singe it does 20 damage flicks the burn (102:23 - 102:30)
condition and then its flavor text says (102:26 - 102:32)
it uses ceilings and walls to launch (102:30 - 102:35)
aerial attacks but it's fiery tail is (102:32 - 102:37)
but one weapon and then I made the joke (102:35 - 102:42)
that I said it's not one but weapon and (102:37 - 102:46)
I'd still love that and then uh yeah and (102:42 - 102:48)
in its stage to form because this is the (102:46 - 102:51)
stage one has the ability flaming (102:48 - 102:52)
fighter where you put six damage (102:51 - 102:54)
counters instead of to on your (102:52 - 102:56)
opponent's burn Pokemon between turns (102:54 - 103:12)
who's that Pokemon it's you wow Monferno (102:56 - 103:17)
I'm Inferno correct it is mine Farah no (103:12 - 103:20)
I figured I'd give it to Steve because (103:17 - 103:22)
you know TCG is not my thing yet Here I (103:20 - 103:25)
am he's so wise once again Monferno has (103:22 - 103:28)
been a recent card it was in Sun and (103:25 - 103:31)
Moon ultra prism (103:28 - 103:34)
yeah my bet which I believe is still in (103:31 - 103:37)
rotation maybe I think ultra prism still (103:34 - 103:41)
is yeah Monferno shares its category (103:37 - 103:43)
with Pancham they are both known as the (103:41 - 103:48)
playful Pokemon that's your only trivia (103:43 - 103:48)
are cute (103:49 - 103:56)
is the ultra what as ultra prism is that (103:51 - 103:58)
a good set Steve would you open packs of (103:56 - 104:01)
ultra prism no I mean I'll take all (103:58 - 104:04)
through prism over XY evolutions and (104:01 - 104:07)
burning shadows I think ultra prism only (104:04 - 104:09)
has alternate rows ma (104:07 - 104:12)
I think that's all it has that's good at (104:09 - 104:15)
this point I said nope no boss's orders (104:12 - 104:17)
no interest yeah no boss's orders No (104:15 - 104:18)
Deal (104:17 - 104:22)
Remo boxes or dude na GX I'm out (104:18 - 104:25)
yeah get that trainer kit (104:22 - 104:26)
and hope that's why I always bring (104:25 - 104:28)
without a trainer kids that's what we (104:26 - 104:30)
talked about it last we has bosses and (104:28 - 104:34)
cards for cheap that's right not on par (104:30 - 104:37)
I think that's that card maybe thirty (104:34 - 104:39)
dollars okay it's all coming back to me (104:37 - 104:39)
now (104:39 - 104:42)
this week's Pokemon of the week will be (104:39 - 104:45)
much easier for Gregg because it is not (104:42 - 104:47)
based in the very popular game the (104:45 - 104:49)
Pokemon Trading Card Game (104:47 - 104:53)
still I got it right yes congratulations (104:49 - 104:54)

groove on tazed field guide to pokemon (104:54 - 104:59)
visual identification has this to say (104:57 - 105:02)
about to this week's pokemon next to its (104:59 - 105:05)
image the japanese refer to this insect (105:02 - 105:08)
as pen drawer coming from Scolopendra (105:05 - 105:12)
the astute viewer will note that as this (105:08 - 105:14)
creature has unfurled from its previous (105:12 - 105:17)
form the coloring of its rings and (105:14 - 105:20)
background have been exchanged while (105:17 - 105:23)
previously it was primarily purple with (105:20 - 105:25)
magenta rings it is now primarily (105:23 - 105:29)
magenta with light purple rings coming (105:25 - 105:31)
from the pede family of pokemon its (105:29 - 105:34)
predecessors the centipede Pokemon and (105:31 - 105:36)
the curl of heat Pokemon the now mega (105:34 - 105:39)
pede Pokemon actually only stands on (105:36 - 105:41)
four of its feet holding the other eight (105:39 - 105:45)
up in the air to also appear to be (105:41 - 105:48)
vestigial across its midsection if you (105:45 - 105:51)
do come across this Pokemon use care it (105:48 - 105:53)
does carry a poison point and has been (105:51 - 105:55)
known to swarm it used to have quick (105:53 - 105:58)
feet but that has not been seen outside (105:55 - 106:00)
of you Nova while it can easily be (105:58 - 106:03)
confused for ascenta scorch it does not (106:00 - 106:05)
have any flames its coloring is similar (106:03 - 106:07)
to Dre peons but the feelers extending (106:05 - 106:11)
from its head are much smaller also make (106:07 - 106:13)
certain to note the many similarities to (106:11 - 106:16)
Giratina and there you go that's this (106:13 - 106:18)
week's Pokemon taken straight from Grove (106:16 - 106:20)

you're worried about stories spoilers (106:37 - 106:44)
I'm done with it so you can come and (106:39 - 106:46)
stream knowing that I'll probably just (106:44 - 106:49)

marks also my boxes are a huge mess (107:04 - 107:08)
again still want to get that Magee Rinna (107:06 - 107:10)
