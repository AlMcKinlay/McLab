BBA what's up everyone welcome to the (0:20 - 0:27)
600th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:24 - 0:30)

didn't go like uh can I get a (0:30 - 0:34)
584 uh I'm your host Steve with me is (0:35 - 0:42)
Hannah I am here happy 600th episode I (0:39 - 0:44)
have listened to far more than I have (0:42 - 0:47)
been here for but now I'm here you can't (0:44 - 0:50)
you can't get that time back I don't (0:47 - 0:52)
want it (0:50 - 0:57)
back CG also here I am here look Episode (0:52 - 1:02)
600 face reveal finally our faces be (0:57 - 1:05)
seen the secrets been (1:02 - 1:08)
revealed uh so obviously big big (1:05 - 1:10)
milestone for 600 uh I've been working (1:08 - 1:14)
on a revamped logo on and off for the (1:10 - 1:17)
last couple months it's not done of (1:14 - 1:20)
course why would it be done by 600 uh we (1:17 - 1:22)
have a new theme song in the works not (1:20 - 1:24)
done because I'm way too picky although (1:22 - 1:27)
I figure I think Nick has really nailed (1:24 - 1:30)
it this time so uh it will probably (1:27 - 1:32)
actually be done next week but at this (1:30 - 1:34)
point might as well hold the theme song (1:32 - 1:36)
to The (1:34 - 1:36)
Locos so you know I think a lot of it is (1:36 - 1:43)
you know not only did this episode land (1:40 - 1:47)
fairly shortly fairly shortly after the (1:43 - 1:49)
holidays but I didn't expect both (1:47 - 1:53)
Pokemon DLCs to be so close together if (1:49 - 1:56)
only the DLC based on a summer Japanese (1:53 - 1:58)
festival would have came out during the (1:56 - 2:01)
summer yeah if only (1:58 - 2:04)
there would have been more time in (2:01 - 2:07)
between but here we are um so we do have (2:04 - 2:10)
a a little special 600 segment at the at (2:07 - 2:12)
the end of the episode but we got a lot (2:10 - 2:15)
of news to get through this week so uh (2:12 - 2:18)
like always let's start off with our (2:15 - 2:22)
Pokemon sleep news which is a brand new (2:18 - 2:27)
island is coming that probably like 5% (2:22 - 2:29)
of players can even access I would (2:27 - 2:31)
assume at this point here's here's the (2:29 - 2:33)
the key if you cannot access snow drop (2:31 - 2:36)
yet you cannot access this new (2:33 - 2:40)
island wrecked if you just unlock snow (2:36 - 2:43)
snow drop you also cannot unlock this (2:40 - 2:47)
island um it is called lapis Lakeside (2:43 - 2:49)
not to conf be confused with (2:47 - 2:51)
Lapras uh and you will need (2:49 - 2:55)
240 sleep Styles needed and I think for (2:51 - 2:58)
snow drop you need what like 200 or (2:55 - 3:02)
something no cuz I only have 179 and I (2:58 - 3:04)
have access to snow drop I think it (3:02 - 3:07)
might be 170 or 17 it's (3:04 - 3:07)
170 that's like what that's like a 70 (3:08 - 3:15)
Pokemon difference yep that's a (3:11 - 3:18)
lot um they're saying that Dratini (3:15 - 3:20)
Dragon Aire and Dragonite will appear (3:18 - 3:23)
during drowsy sleep rals klia and gavor (3:20 - 3:26)
with snoozing sleep and Stuffle (3:23 - 3:29)
beware and Glade my three favorite (3:26 - 3:30)
Pokemon that evolve into each other with (3:29 - 3:34)
slumbering sleep uh Snorlax favorite (3:30 - 3:35)
berries on this island are the Cherry (3:34 - 3:39)
Berry the maggo berry and the Duan (3:35 - 3:42)
Berry uh durian off the top of my head (3:39 - 3:45)
is the one that like Bulbasaur uses I (3:42 - 3:47)
think it's a little grassy one because I (3:45 - 3:50)
think Leafeon also uses it if you (3:47 - 3:51)
haven't figured out the berry thing in (3:50 - 3:53)
Pokemon sleep it's usually based off (3:51 - 3:54)
like (3:53 - 3:57)
type like the grass Pokemon I'll have a (3:54 - 4:00)
berry water Pokemon I'll have orand very (3:57 - 4:04)
usually uh so it took 150 sleep styles (4:00 - 4:08)
to unlock snow drop (4:04 - 4:08)
Tundra that's a big jump for the new one (4:08 - 4:14)
that's a big (4:11 - 4:16)
jump (4:14 - 4:19)
150 yeah like 150 plus the initial (4:16 - 4:22)
50 because don't you need 50 to (4:19 - 4:26)
unlock all I all I'm seeing is unlock (4:22 - 4:32)
requirement register 150 sleep styles (4:26 - 4:32)
okay (4:32 - 4:39)
St 20 sleep Styles is for the beach yeah (4:35 - 4:42)
the beach walking on the beach uh yeah I (4:39 - 4:44)
pull all this from SB (4:42 - 4:47)
so (4:44 - 4:47)
um I'm I'm on track to maybe have (4:48 - 4:54)
something that isn't an e or an F this (4:51 - 4:56)
week (4:54 - 4:59)
possibly maybe oh yeah just because is (4:56 - 5:03)
it because you've been cheating no I the (4:59 - 5:05)
cheating we T the cheating did not pay (5:03 - 5:07)
off last (5:05 - 5:10)
week you can cheat in different ways (5:07 - 5:13)
though absolutely (5:10 - 5:17)
can how many sleep styles do I have well (5:13 - 5:20)
I I know I have enough for for snow drop (5:17 - 5:23)
we we'll we'll pull this up okay so I (5:20 - 5:26)
when I was in Chicago did we talk about (5:23 - 5:31)
this I I put my go Plus+ on the like (5:26 - 5:35)
banister or the headboard or whatever (5:31 - 5:37)
and it yelled at me in the morning and (5:35 - 5:40)
it said you were too still when you were (5:37 - 5:43)
sleeping so we stopped tracking (5:40 - 5:45)
it so I don't know how people are (5:43 - 5:48)
cheating that (5:45 - 5:50)
way I think that either you have to (5:48 - 5:52)
leave it on something I don't want to (5:50 - 5:55)
explain how to cheat in a in a Pokemon (5:52 - 5:58)
game yeah you do go for it cuz you do it (5:55 - 5:59)
this is your admitting that you cheat (5:58 - 6:01)
cheater (5:59 - 6:03)
cheat no but i' I've read people that (6:01 - 6:05)
are like oh I strug look I get I get why (6:03 - 6:07)
people would right cuz like what we just (6:05 - 6:10)
said like uh Beware and stuff will only (6:07 - 6:12)
appear during slumbering so if you're if (6:10 - 6:13)
you're a person that keeps getting (6:12 - 6:16)
drowsy or snoozing then you're going to (6:13 - 6:18)
be frustrated that you're not getting (6:16 - 6:21)
beware like so you're like oh well if I (6:18 - 6:23)
put it on my bedside table then I it (6:21 - 6:26)
will have a deeper sleep but the one (6:23 - 6:28)
time I did it cuz I I genuinely wanted (6:26 - 6:30)
to see like oh like how good is this (6:28 - 6:32)
going to make my sleep thing then it (6:30 - 6:34)
yelled at me in the morning that we like (6:32 - 6:36)
we are only counting 6 hours not eight (6:34 - 6:39)
hours because we decided you were too (6:36 - 6:42)
still yeah I think that the trick is to (6:39 - 6:44)
leave it on the still surface for a (6:42 - 6:46)
couple of hours before you go to sleep (6:44 - 6:48)
and then put it on the mattress or on (6:46 - 6:50)
the other end you have it on the (6:48 - 6:51)
mattress all night and then you put it (6:50 - 6:53)
on a still surface for a couple hours (6:51 - 6:55)
before you press the button to wake it (6:53 - 6:58)
up God just leave the bed it's on a (6:55 - 6:59)
still service at that point if you just (6:58 - 7:01)
leave it on the you're not in it true (6:59 - 7:05)
that too sleep Styles where do you see a (7:01 - 7:07)
total I see one for each you click you (7:05 - 7:10)
click your Pokemon icon you go into you (7:07 - 7:11)
go into the menu and then your Pokemon (7:10 - 7:13)
icon in the upper (7:11 - 7:16)
left I'm a little stable eye I guess (7:13 - 7:19)
that's another way to do it uh I I have (7:16 - 7:22)
200 of (7:19 - 7:22)
463 I also have 200 of (7:22 - 7:31)
463 and I have 179 I thought it was to (7:26 - 7:35)
2:30 no 240 240 no it said it's 2:30 (7:31 - 7:37)
well then sarab is wrong cuz I copy and (7:35 - 7:40)
pasted I know how to game freak I copy (7:37 - 7:43)
and pasted these I am on pokemon.com (7:40 - 7:47)
Pokemon news you can unlock this new (7:43 - 7:50)
thing you'll need at least 230 entries (7:47 - 7:52)
in your sleep sex stle to unlock lapis (7:50 - 7:56)
Lakeside according to (7:52 - 7:56)
pokemon.com well sb.net clearly has a (7:56 - 8:05)
[Laughter] (8:01 - 8:08)
typo so so (8:05 - 8:11)
230 okay that's I mean 30 new sleep (8:08 - 8:13)
sleep Styles is I guess I guess maybe (8:11 - 8:15)
it's so high because they're doing that (8:13 - 8:18)
Dragon event next week so you can get (8:15 - 8:20)
dratini on they say that was going to be (8:18 - 8:21)
the (8:20 - 8:24)
beach I think it green grass oh is it (8:21 - 8:26)
green grass isn't everything in green (8:24 - 8:28)
grass (8:26 - 8:31)
yeah just everything you just want to go (8:28 - 8:33)
to green grass all the time well if you (8:31 - 8:34)
want new sleep Styles you probably (8:33 - 8:37)
shouldn't be staying on green grass (8:34 - 8:38)
because you're probably getting a lot of (8:37 - 8:41)
like yeah but you'll be getting new more (8:38 - 8:42)
chances at Pokemon that are new that (8:41 - 8:45)
have new sleep Styles if you go to (8:42 - 8:47)
Greengrass for this Dragon week yeah but (8:45 - 8:49)
if you're if you haven't even locked (8:47 - 8:51)
snow drop it's probably because you've (8:49 - 8:53)
been non-stop I still haven't gotten an (8:51 - 8:57)
onyx I want to say that it's it's been (8:53 - 9:00)
like four weeks on tap (8:57 - 9:04)
or you haven't caught one I haven't seen (9:00 - 9:06)
one yeah you'd better bet that Steve (9:04 - 9:07)
would probably use a master ball on the (9:06 - 9:11)
first onx what else am I using with my (9:07 - 9:14)
points I can only buy like so many boky (9:11 - 9:17)
biscuits a month before it times me out (9:14 - 9:19)
I'm like you can't buy (9:17 - 9:23)
anymore uh yeah I mean like the dragon (9:19 - 9:24)
stuff makes sense cuz it is Year of the (9:23 - 9:27)
Dragon so they're going real real hard (9:24 - 9:30)
in into the dragon stuff until probably (9:27 - 9:33)
next month where they forget about (9:30 - 9:38)
it but uh yeah there's your Pokemon (9:33 - 9:42)
sleep news uh the epilog is out in (9:38 - 9:45)
scarlet and violet uh it takes like I (9:42 - 9:46)
don't know anywhere between like an hour (9:45 - 9:48)
to an hour and a half depending on how (9:46 - 9:49)
fast or slow you play we're going to (9:48 - 9:50)
talk about it next week because we (9:49 - 9:52)
always have like the one week make sure (9:50 - 9:55)
you get your you know we want to talk (9:52 - 9:57)
about but we also don't want to spoil so (9:55 - 9:58)
we do the one (9:57 - 10:00)
week then on you if you're listening to (9:58 - 10:02)
a Pokemon podcast and you haven't done (10:00 - 10:06)
it in a week so uh but in order to do (10:02 - 10:09)
that you do need to beat both dlc's uh (10:06 - 10:11)
which means you have to uh hear Ed (10:09 - 10:13)
Sheran one more time at the end of the (10:11 - 10:16)
Indigo disc uh and then you do have to (10:13 - 10:18)
get the mystery gift uh you can get the (10:16 - 10:20)
mystery gift at any time you don't need (10:18 - 10:23)
to get the DLC to get the mystery gift (10:20 - 10:26)
there is no end date as far as this (10:23 - 10:28)
recording of when they will pull the (10:26 - 10:31)
mystery gift uh so no worries about that (10:28 - 10:33)
you should just get it because why (10:31 - 10:34)
wouldn't you get it well next time you (10:33 - 10:36)
boot up your game uh and then in order (10:34 - 10:40)
to start it uh you have to talk to the (10:36 - 10:43)

across from Millennial Nurse Joy yeah (10:53 - 10:58)
gosh she's the best I love her she's the (10:56 - 10:59)
greatest and they don't use her or (10:58 - 11:01)
anywhere else and why she needs to be (10:59 - 11:02)
the standard going (11:01 - 11:05)
forward yeah she she is she is by far (11:02 - 11:08)
the best character in that whole (11:05 - 11:08)
series we can talk about her next week (11:08 - 11:13)
uh okay speaking of good characters in (11:11 - 11:17)

collab collab with iono and belly bolt (11:26 - 11:31)
and Pokemon Masters ex this was uh (11:28 - 11:34)
January 11th this is off (11:31 - 11:36)
pokemon.com uh you've seen iono in (11:34 - 11:38)
Pokemon Scarlet Violet video games and (11:36 - 11:41)
now you get to connect with her on Pao (11:38 - 11:43)
iono is gearing up to live stream from (11:41 - 11:46)
Pao and everyone is excited even Lear I (11:43 - 11:49)
forgot about Lear even he's like the (11:46 - 11:52)
main character of this entire (11:49 - 11:54)
thing (11:52 - 11:58)
you when you only log in get your gems (11:54 - 12:00)
and then pull on banners you kind of (11:58 - 12:03)
forget that Lear is (12:00 - 12:08)
there is Lear in the smooching Booth no (12:03 - 12:12)
see that's the problem I have added I (12:08 - 12:15)
have added Giovani to my smooching Booth (12:12 - 12:20)
to see what's going on and I feel like I (12:15 - 12:23)
am I am meeting with a person attempting (12:20 - 12:26)
to get me to join a cult the things that (12:23 - 12:29)
that man says that makes sense are (12:26 - 12:31)
absolutely (12:29 - 12:36)
unhinged and I'm like wait is Cyrus no (12:31 - 12:38)
is Cyrus in the booth no Cyrus is not in (12:36 - 12:43)
the booth Cyrus yes yet Cyrus would only (12:38 - 12:45)
go to the booth with his only friend in (12:43 - 12:46)
the (12:45 - 12:49)
world and since I don't think those you (12:46 - 12:50)
you would have to you'd have to put them (12:49 - 12:53)
into together the only way Cyrus would (12:50 - 12:56)
go has Cyrus had any other interactions (12:53 - 12:59)
with anyone that isn't Sophocles oh yeah (12:56 - 13:01)
yeah everybody's been mad at Cyrus (12:59 - 13:04)
multiple times like everybody wants to (13:01 - 13:07)
like lock up Cyrus for incredibly valid (13:04 - 13:11)
reasons uh but uh Sophocles is like no (13:07 - 13:13)
he's my friend and then everybody's like (13:11 - 13:16)
okay I guess as long as you keep an eye (13:13 - 13:19)
on him I mean Cyrus does talk to his (13:16 - 13:21)
flunkies except I would not call them (13:19 - 13:23)
friends because he orders them around (13:21 - 13:24)
and they're like I guess I don't know (13:23 - 13:28)
whatever G boss um but yeah Cyrus is (13:24 - 13:31)
just sad all the time and you get to go (13:28 - 13:34)
you get to go see him out staring at the (13:31 - 13:38)
ocean being sad a lot it's like his main (13:34 - 13:40)
thing is you always find him staring at (13:38 - 13:43)
the ocean being sad it's like oh buddy (13:40 - 13:45)
your best friend's the most annoying (13:43 - 13:48)
character I feel like Cyrus and giovan (13:45 - 13:50)
would have good dialogue they hate each (13:48 - 13:53)
other they didn't they they had some (13:50 - 13:55)
dialog in the rainbow rocket stuff they (13:53 - 13:59)
did um but all of the current villains (13:55 - 14:03)
hate Giovani right now I mean right now (13:59 - 14:07)
but not always yeah so for until he (14:03 - 14:10)
everybody thought that Giovani was (14:07 - 14:12)
helping them to meet their own goals and (14:10 - 14:14)
then one by one they all got betrayed by (14:12 - 14:17)
Giovani because giovan is like ha my (14:14 - 14:19)
goals is to take over the universe uh (14:17 - 14:22)
thanks for being a dupe uh so now all of (14:19 - 14:26)
the villains hate him um because he's a (14:22 - 14:29)
jerk uh in like the funniest one is like (14:26 - 14:32)
chairman Rose was 100% team Giovani for (14:29 - 14:34)
quite some time was like this guy's a (14:32 - 14:37)
brilliant he's got Vis love for him he's (14:34 - 14:39)
got so much going for him together we're (14:37 - 14:42)
gonna make a name for ourselves and then (14:39 - 14:44)
giovan is likeah this is all for me and (14:42 - 14:46)

like how dare you how could you take (14:46 - 14:54)
away my fame you're dead to me and Allan (14:50 - 14:56)
is the background being (14:54 - 14:59)
like I've been mourning you forever (14:56 - 15:01)
about this person and you don't listen (14:59 - 15:03)
to me oana is pretty fun in this game (15:01 - 15:06)
too she is uh she's meeting some girls (15:03 - 15:09)
she's sign of seeing like rose isn't the (15:06 - 15:11)
only option in her life she's out there (15:09 - 15:13)
getting the gal pal stuff on and we're (15:11 - 15:15)

changing Luc mean still is you (15:15 - 15:21)

collect uh the what's who's who's a (15:58 - 16:03)
what's it stickers which count towards a (16:01 - 16:06)
global total the more stickers everyone (16:03 - 16:08)
collects the better rewards everyone (16:06 - 16:10)
gets I'm going to go on an assumption (16:08 - 16:12)
that if you want to collect the rewards (16:10 - 16:15)
you probably have to at least log in (16:12 - 16:18)
before January 18th yeah you'll have to (16:15 - 16:19)
log (16:18 - 16:24)
in um you have to you only get the (16:19 - 16:30)
stickers uh through the co-op battle (16:24 - 16:34)
um a lot of people are mad about the (16:30 - 16:38)
top thing it's a whole the top free (16:34 - 16:42)
reward yeah so if everybody collects two (16:38 - 16:45)
million stickers we get 35 star poll (16:42 - 16:48)
tickets uh if we get five million (16:45 - 16:51)
stickers we get one of each of the coins (16:48 - 16:54)
that allow you to buy the candies that (16:51 - 16:57)
let you boost their potential without (16:54 - 17:00)
having to pull them if we get 7 million (16:57 - 17:02)
we get the little discs that allow us to (17:00 - 17:05)
buy the cakes that unlock the extra Tech (17:02 - 17:07)
or the extra (17:05 - 17:10)
support scale the character has and then (17:07 - 17:15)
at 10 million and I kind of see why you (17:10 - 17:18)
get an artwork for the (17:15 - 17:18)
lodge oh I feel like that should be like (17:19 - 17:24)
flipped feel like the artwork should be (17:22 - 17:26)
a little bit lower maybe it's cool (17:24 - 17:29)
artwork though it's not I mean it's I (17:26 - 17:30)
belly boolt but it's not a particularly (17:29 - 17:32)
great one it's just her in front of (17:30 - 17:34)
belly bolt like it's it's C where is it (17:32 - 17:36)
going in the lounge is it like just a (17:34 - 17:38)
picture on the wall yeah you can (17:36 - 17:40)
redecorate your lounge and put that on (17:38 - 17:41)
the wall if you want like you can have (17:40 - 17:43)
it but (17:41 - 17:46)
again I don't disagree that people felt (17:43 - 17:48)
it should be a gem reward or something (17:46 - 17:51)
else other than a piece of art for the (17:48 - 17:55)
lounge it is a bit (17:51 - 17:57)
disappointing everything else up to it (17:55 - 18:00)
though is great like solid choices for (17:57 - 18:01)
all of them because I don't think those (18:00 - 18:04)
goals are particularly hard to meet um (18:01 - 18:05)
you (18:04 - 18:07)
get you get 50 stickers if you do the (18:05 - 18:11)
hardest one it's really easy to do them (18:07 - 18:12)
and since you're doing with three people (18:11 - 18:14)
like every every group that does it gets (18:12 - 18:17)
150 stickers so it's like not an (18:14 - 18:20)
incredibly difficult goal to hit but the (18:17 - 18:23)
top goal is like for 10 million you get (18:20 - 18:25)
one piece of artwork it's (18:23 - 18:27)
like but artwork isn't even that (18:25 - 18:30)
expensive in the trainers Lounge like I (18:27 - 18:32)
have so many things but it's exclusive (18:30 - 18:35)
artwork it is exclusive artwork until (18:32 - 18:37)
it's not right like until they just put (18:35 - 18:39)
it in there and she can be invited in (18:37 - 18:41)
and then it becomes her standard artwork (18:39 - 18:43)
whatever I think it probably should have (18:41 - 18:46)
been artwork and some gems (18:43 - 18:49)
but it's it's F it's free you know (18:46 - 18:51)
they're really counting on io's (18:49 - 18:54)
popularity there they are oh yeah yeah (18:51 - 18:57)
yeah yeah it is incredibly popular so (18:54 - 18:59)
like there is a subsection of people who (18:57 - 19:02)
really want that artwork I am not one of (18:59 - 19:05)
them but I know there are people who are (19:02 - 19:06)
excited by having that exclusive piece (19:05 - 19:07)
of (19:06 - 19:11)
artwork when they tweeted (19:07 - 19:14)
theas Pokemon Masters Twitter tweeted (19:11 - 19:18)
that like a p uh not Pao a Pala gym (19:14 - 19:21)
leader is is coming if you read the (19:18 - 19:22)
comments it was either people being like (19:21 - 19:27)
it's Russia or it's iono and it's like (19:22 - 19:28)
yeah I guess those are the two most (19:27 - 19:32)
popular gy like don't forget Larry okay (19:28 - 19:34)
there was there was Larry's there (19:32 - 19:35)
there's a lar I was a Larry contingent (19:34 - 19:37)
even though I knew it was going to beo (19:35 - 19:41)
like there was no way it wasn't but I'm (19:37 - 19:46)
like do us all a solid be Larry I Feel (19:41 - 19:48)
Like Larry is popular but I feel like (19:46 - 19:51)
it's popular with like like adults (19:48 - 19:54)
because we know the work life grind (19:51 - 19:57)
whereas like eono and grusia are just an (19:54 - 19:59)
all AG popul (19:57 - 20:01)
they (19:59 - 20:04)
are like I don't like no no shade to (20:01 - 20:07)
like a 14-year-old but I don't think (20:04 - 20:12)
they truly understand Larry like we do (20:07 - 20:14)
not like we (20:12 - 20:14)
do which is like it's really great that (20:15 - 20:23)
like there's a range of characters that (20:18 - 20:27)
different ages of players can relate to (20:23 - 20:30)
Larry is really one for the people I am (20:27 - 20:32)
so excited for Larry to come to this (20:30 - 20:34)
game because I want to know what stories (20:32 - 20:35)
they're going to tell with this (20:34 - 20:38)
exhausted man who suddenly isn't at work (20:35 - 20:40)
and has been forced to go on vacation on (20:38 - 20:43)
this island with everybody else is Larry (20:40 - 20:45)
gonna get the (20:43 - 20:47)
dunpar or would it it would or would it (20:45 - 20:49)
be just star it can't be star rptor (20:47 - 20:51)
because that weird Butler guy has star (20:49 - 20:53)
rptor well okay they can always like (20:51 - 20:55)
they will so it will (20:53 - 20:58)
be it will first be the dunpar because (20:55 - 21:00)
that's like the signature and nobody (20:58 - 21:02)
else has it so that'll be regular Suit (21:00 - 21:05)
Larry and then there there will (21:02 - 21:08)
be Larry Sigma Suit Larry that has (21:05 - 21:10)
staraptor where he is forced to dress in (21:08 - 21:13)
some horrible outfit that he hates like (21:10 - 21:15)
there's so much story potential for (21:13 - 21:18)
Larry and Masters the the only other one (21:15 - 21:20)
I want to see as bad as Larry is to (21:18 - 21:22)
still want meor B to show up in Pokemon (21:20 - 21:25)
Masters please bring in mirie but also (21:22 - 21:30)
bring in Larry because I think Larry (21:25 - 21:30)
Larry Larry's level exhaustion is what's (21:30 - 21:35)
needed to temper the hyperactivity of (21:33 - 21:37)
all these kids running around that's all (21:35 - 21:39)
I gotta say but they they could also do (21:37 - 21:43)

greatest thing that has yet to be (25:03 - 25:07)

we have uh what do we have on our on our (25:13 - 25:20)
when we're coming back oh uh we have (25:18 - 25:24)
some actually good news for Pokemon go (25:20 - 25:26)
which is very surprising for the 600 (25:24 - 25:30)
episode Craig Niantic has done it again (25:26 - 25:33)
we will be right (25:30 - 25:41)
[Music] (25:33 - 25:41)
back and we are back from our break uh (25:43 - 25:50)
before we get to the Pokemon go news we (25:47 - 25:52)
got some tragic (25:50 - 25:57)
news uh on on on our dear 600th episode (25:52 - 26:02)
uh Pokemon Horizon the series got (25:57 - 26:02)
delayed how why how how how it's done (26:04 - 26:11)
it's done how is it delayed just put it (26:09 - 26:14)
out just put it (26:11 - 26:14)
out they don't even say it was delayed (26:14 - 26:19)
they they but it they said it on a (26:17 - 26:22)
couple of channels I've seen them say it (26:19 - 26:24)
okay but on pokemon.com they just say (26:22 - 26:26)
Pokemon Horizons the series will now (26:24 - 26:29)
premiere on March 7th on nflix just a (26:26 - 26:31)
shorter time later than previously (26:29 - 26:33)
announced which I think it was initially (26:31 - 26:36)
announced on like the 24th or something (26:33 - 26:38)
it was like two or three days before (26:36 - 26:40)
Pokemon day yeah which I can't remember (26:38 - 26:42)
Pokemon day is the (26:40 - 26:44)
206 (26:42 - 26:46)
27th (26:44 - 26:49)
um get ready to debut with Incredible (26:46 - 26:51)
Adventures of Leo and Roy as well as (26:49 - 26:52)
many friends and foes and of course (26:51 - 26:53)
you'll discover countless amazing (26:52 - 26:58)
Pokemons along the way uh so no reason (26:53 - 27:01)
shortly after I saw this announcement I (26:58 - 27:04)
then went to Instagram where I got an (27:01 - 27:08)
Instagram reel from Pokemon UK with a (27:04 - 27:13)
one minute video of Pokemon Horizons in (27:08 - 27:15)
like a few episodes in because they (27:13 - 27:17)
they've had it out there for a while (27:15 - 27:21)
it's all in English why there's not like (27:17 - 27:24)
a there's not like a British voice actor (27:21 - 27:26)
and like an America although that would (27:24 - 27:28)
maybe kind of be cool that would be (27:26 - 27:30)
pretty cool though if they (27:28 - 27:35)
did it's done I don't get it the only (27:30 - 27:37)
the only thing I can guess is that the (27:35 - 27:40)
release date it had before was the day (27:37 - 27:42)
after the new avatar the Last air bender (27:40 - 27:44)
live action show comes out and maybe (27:42 - 27:46)
they didn't want it to conflict with (27:44 - 27:48)
that because we know they don't care (27:46 - 27:52)
about it being the day before go to or (27:48 - 27:54)
Global doesn't matter if Pokemon things (27:52 - 27:56)
overlap I think the I feel like the (27:54 - 27:58)
reason they would want it like two days (27:56 - 28:02)
before Pokemon day or whatever is to be (27:58 - 28:06)
then come on Pokemon day and be like the (28:02 - 28:08)
first episode was watched eight million (28:06 - 28:11)
times like like they want to like brag (28:08 - 28:14)
about it or something like I I can't (28:11 - 28:16)
imagine there's like a licensing issue (28:14 - 28:19)
or like Netflix like like drop the ball (28:16 - 28:21)
or something to be like ah we need extra (28:19 - 28:24)
two weeks we're not ready for next month (28:21 - 28:28)
I mean Avatar is February 2 and this was (28:24 - 28:30)
supposed to be February 23rd but like (28:28 - 28:32)
there is (28:30 - 28:37)
some crossover I don't know that (28:32 - 28:40)
that I don't know that Netflix (28:37 - 28:44)
treats Pokemon horizons with enough fanf (28:40 - 28:47)
fair that they're like well we can't (28:44 - 28:50)
announce this and Avatar like they're (28:47 - 28:52)
going hard into Avatar and it's like oh (28:50 - 28:53)
just tell the Pokemon people they're (28:52 - 28:56)
delayed like well I mean like there (28:53 - 29:00)
there could be some a little bit of like (28:56 - 29:03)
maybe Netflix was was like surprised of (29:00 - 29:05)
how well concierge (29:03 - 29:08)
did I mean well here well let's back up (29:05 - 29:10)
Netflix was definitely surprised in how (29:08 - 29:13)
well one piece did oh for sure CU they (29:10 - 29:16)
are scrambling to get everything one (29:13 - 29:19)
piece to the front of the page of yeah (29:16 - 29:22)
yeah they were not prepared for how well (29:19 - 29:25)
that went so maybe there is something (29:22 - 29:27)
where they're like okay well we know one (29:25 - 29:28)
piece is doing good the Pokemon thing (29:27 - 29:30)
doing good maybe we have high (29:28 - 29:32)
expectations that Avatar is doing good (29:30 - 29:34)
so maybe there is a little spacing and I (29:32 - 29:36)
feel like the Pokemon company is a (29:34 - 29:39)
company that's like oh you're going to (29:36 - 29:41)
offer us more money to delay something (29:39 - 29:43)
by two weeks yes we will We Love Money (29:41 - 29:47)
here we put out the same two games every (29:43 - 29:50)
three years and uh our audience will buy (29:47 - 29:54)
both of them we definitely love (29:50 - 29:54)
money so maybe I mean like the weird (29:54 - 29:59)
thing about Netflix is that it's it's (29:57 - 30:03)
it's like a dating app like it it learns (29:59 - 30:05)
your oh you guys don't know (30:03 - 30:08)
this like you have to keep talking oh (30:05 - 30:11)
okay n for the for the audio podcast (30:08 - 30:13)
listeners Greg and Hannah look look like (30:11 - 30:15)
I just like turned into a skeleton or (30:13 - 30:18)
something on screen so I'm waiting for (30:15 - 30:20)
this dubious connection of how you got (30:18 - 30:22)
there instead of any of the other things (30:20 - 30:24)
that learn your no no Netflix is 100% (30:22 - 30:26)
designed like a dating app even the the (30:24 - 30:27)
people who work at Netflix have admitted (30:26 - 30:31)
this it is designed to see what you like (30:27 - 30:33)
and you don't like and it will try like (30:31 - 30:35)
a dating app to pair you with shows that (30:33 - 30:37)
it thinks you will like Netflix is also (30:35 - 30:40)
frequently change will change the album (30:37 - 30:42)
cover of different TV shows to get you (30:40 - 30:45)
to be more interested so if you open if (30:42 - 30:49)
I open up like disenchantment on mine I (30:45 - 30:52)
will probably have an image of like Bean (30:49 - 30:54)
who is the main character where like (30:52 - 30:56)
Greg might have a picture of Lucy which (30:54 - 30:58)
is like the little devil dude and then (30:56 - 31:02)
Hannah might have a picture of um Alo (30:58 - 31:03)
which is the other character because (31:02 - 31:05)
it's trying to base off what you're (31:03 - 31:08)
tapping on it is it is assigning you (31:05 - 31:09)
different shows but not only is it (31:08 - 31:10)
assigning you different shows it's (31:09 - 31:13)
assigning you different images on those (31:10 - 31:15)
shows to get you to pick it um there are (31:13 - 31:18)
a lot of apps that use algorithmic (31:15 - 31:20)
recognition and I think dating apps are (31:18 - 31:22)
some of the ones that actually do that (31:20 - 31:25)
less no dating apps use algorithms to (31:22 - 31:26)
pair you with (31:25 - 31:29)
people (31:26 - 31:29)
I don't know why you guys are like I (31:32 - 31:36)
feel like you guys are like thinking I'm (31:34 - 31:38)
lying to you when like Netflix has (31:36 - 31:40)
literally admitted this I I believe that (31:38 - 31:44)
I'm just I don't know that dating apps (31:40 - 31:45)
uh compared to things like Spotify and (31:44 - 31:48)
every other algorithm that tries to mat (31:45 - 31:51)
you to things uh but again my experience (31:48 - 31:53)
on dating apps are very different than (31:51 - 31:56)
everybody else's obviously so Spotify (31:53 - 31:59)
can't like change like the visual you're (31:56 - 32:01)
looking at like like like not to be like (31:59 - 32:03)
super shallow but like people are (32:01 - 32:04)
judging other people off a dating app (32:03 - 32:08)
literally just by the picture right so (32:04 - 32:09)
like I don't think the app is picking (32:08 - 32:13)
the best picture to show (32:09 - 32:13)
you what they think is the best picture (32:15 - 32:21)
to show you which never is I have seen I (32:18 - 32:23)
don't think I don't think Tinder is like (32:21 - 32:25)
arranging the pictures for (32:23 - 32:28)
you but Netflix is (32:25 - 32:31)
but so is Spotify like I think a lot of (32:28 - 32:34)
the like Spotify Spotify there's no (32:31 - 32:36)
picture well I guess there's album art (32:34 - 32:37)
but you're not it's not changing the (32:36 - 32:41)
album art uh some there it yeah it does (32:37 - 32:43)
so depending when you click on it uh you (32:41 - 32:45)
may get their music video you may get (32:43 - 32:49)
their album art you may get Stills it (32:45 - 32:52)
changes what it shows you when you're (32:49 - 32:54)
playing that song it also changes what's (32:52 - 32:56)
on top of the playlist and selects (32:54 - 32:58)
pictures so you don't always get the (32:56 - 33:01)
album art in Spotify you will get a wide (32:58 - 33:03)
variety of things if you go straight to (33:01 - 33:05)
the person and say hey show me your dis (33:03 - 33:07)
ography yeah you'll see the album art (33:05 - 33:08)
but if it comes up (33:07 - 33:11)
randomly who knows what especially since (33:08 - 33:13)
they've just now added this feature like (33:11 - 33:16)
songs you might like the pictures in (33:13 - 33:18)
there are (33:16 - 33:21)
wild straight up some of them are music (33:18 - 33:22)
videos some of them are people just (33:21 - 33:25)
wandering around I'm like is this (33:22 - 33:28)
related that's thing Spotify for a few (33:25 - 33:30)
years at this point like I start I (33:28 - 33:32)
stopped using spotify years ago and that (33:30 - 33:35)
was happening before then oh (33:32 - 33:37)
yeah I don't think that's an algorithm (33:35 - 33:39)
thing I think that that's manually said (33:37 - 33:41)
by the (33:39 - 33:44)
artist could be I don't know I I know in (33:41 - 33:46)
apple music you can't even downvote (33:44 - 33:48)
something no you can't which is like (33:46 - 33:50)
crazy to me cuz Apple was like would you (33:48 - 33:51)
like six months of Apple music for like (33:50 - 33:53)
$5 I was like yeah sure and then I was (33:51 - 33:55)
like oh I can't I don't want to listen (33:53 - 33:57)
to this anymore Apple music there's no (33:55 - 34:01)
downvote button stop giving me this I (33:57 - 34:04)
don't want nickel (34:01 - 34:04)
back please (34:05 - 34:11)
stop yeah anyways uh going back to the (34:08 - 34:13)
Netflix (34:11 - 34:16)
thing I I I I can't imagine that the (34:13 - 34:19)
Pokemon company would have any reason to (34:16 - 34:22)
say like okay hold off on two more weeks (34:19 - 34:25)
I do kind of tend to agree with Hannah (34:22 - 34:26)
that maybe it's a Netflix thing where (34:25 - 34:29)
they are worried about some sort of (34:26 - 34:32)
overlap I feel like Avatar and Pokemon (34:29 - 34:34)
do have a lot in (34:32 - 34:37)
common I know a lot of people who like a (34:34 - 34:39)
both of those series quite a lot both of (34:37 - 34:41)
the franchises quite a lot wait you said (34:39 - 34:45)
this is an avatar live action yeah yes (34:41 - 34:47)
it is the live action avatar the Last (34:45 - 34:50)
air bender making up for the movie that (34:47 - 34:53)
does not exist um the live action is (34:50 - 34:55)
supposedly going to be better but the (34:53 - 34:57)
creators of avatar stop stopped working (34:55 - 35:00)
with it around the same time they got (34:57 - 35:02)
their own Studio back with Nickelodeon (35:00 - 35:06)
again so we'll see how it goes so not by (35:02 - 35:08)
the Avatar people (35:06 - 35:13)
anymore it was (35:08 - 35:13)
it it's it's complicated I I I think (35:13 - 35:18)
they had a lot to say about the scripts (35:16 - 35:20)
and how the scripts were condensed (35:18 - 35:21)
because they are (35:20 - 35:24)
taking is I think the first season's 24 (35:21 - 35:27)
episodes and the Netflix series is eight (35:24 - 35:29)
so like One Piece One Piece I think was (35:27 - 35:32)
eight Yeah well yeah one piece is eight (35:29 - 35:35)
and one piece first series is like 412 (35:32 - 35:37)
episodes so they really it's only like (35:35 - 35:40)
60 (35:37 - 35:40)
episodes trust me I've looked into this (35:41 - 35:46)
because I'm like do I want to know what (35:44 - 35:49)
happens but also one piece is from like (35:46 - 35:52)
1933 or something and they that's like (35:49 - 35:55)
black and white stick figure (35:52 - 35:58)
drawings like I don't know if I want to (35:55 - 35:59)
actually I think it's like (35:58 - 36:03)
1993 or something like that yeah it's 93 (35:59 - 36:05)
it (36:03 - 36:08)
is here's the thing the one thing about (36:05 - 36:09)
one piece of animated series is you (36:08 - 36:11)
don't need to pay attention to the first (36:09 - 36:13)
10 minutes because it's a recap and (36:11 - 36:15)
replaying of the last 10 minutes of the (36:13 - 36:18)
episode before almost every time so you (36:15 - 36:21)
can jump in 10 minutes late you have not (36:18 - 36:24)
missed anything and then if if you if (36:21 - 36:25)
there was something important in those (36:24 - 36:28)
first 10 minutes three characters (36:25 - 36:30)
throughout that show will remind you (36:28 - 36:32)
what happened in the first 10 minutes (36:30 - 36:34)
and one of them will have a flashback (36:32 - 36:38)
that series is so bloated of worthless (36:34 - 36:41)
moments I went I watched the I watched (36:38 - 36:43)
the Netflix series I'm like oh that's (36:41 - 36:44)
right I was in the middle of one piece (36:43 - 36:48)
and I went back and I was in the middle (36:44 - 36:52)
of the fight at the restaurant and I was (36:48 - 36:57)
in that restaurant for another 10 an Ane (36:52 - 37:04)
episodes and I'm like why are we still (36:57 - 37:06)
here that's like a problem with all like (37:04 - 37:08)
old uh anime though is like Dragon Ball (37:06 - 37:10)
Z I remember watching as a kid and being (37:08 - 37:13)
like it's been 4 weeks you're still (37:10 - 37:17)
charging up please please just continue (37:13 - 37:20)
the battle I mean you can see it also (37:17 - 37:23)
the old the first couple of seasons of (37:20 - 37:25)
the Pokemon anime are that way too like (37:23 - 37:29)
it's just like oh come on (37:25 - 37:29)
uh well your new date is March 7th so (37:29 - 37:36)
there you go (37:33 - 37:38)
Americans I who I don't even know what (37:36 - 37:40)
happened to Australia or Brazil I don't (37:38 - 37:42)
know where you're at with watching if (37:40 - 37:44)
you're in the UK or Canada though you're (37:42 - 37:46)
probably done with the series golden (37:44 - 37:49)
you've seen it (37:46 - 37:49)
all okay uh Pokemon Go News uh which is (37:49 - 37:55)
the Pokemon go news I think is funny on (37:54 - 37:57)
a bunch of levels because l literally (37:55 - 37:59)
last week we talked about how people (37:57 - 38:01)
were saying Pokemon go is dying or nitic (37:59 - 38:06)
hasn't come up with anything new um and (38:01 - 38:08)
then if you go back probably like a (38:06 - 38:12)
month ago when they announced the go I (38:08 - 38:15)
keep wanting to say go tour c (38:12 - 38:18)
tour um we I think all three of us on (38:15 - 38:20)
the show agreed like why isn't there (38:18 - 38:23)
huian Pokemon or when are they going to (38:20 - 38:26)
do origin form dial in palia like like (38:23 - 38:29)
this event seems so Bare Bones to be (38:26 - 38:31)
fair like Saturday already sold out so (38:29 - 38:33)
like I guess they didn't need to (38:31 - 38:35)
announce this but they announc the (38:33 - 38:37)
things we all said you should bring to (38:35 - 38:40)
this game not I not that they listen to (38:37 - 38:42)
the (38:40 - 38:44)
podcast somebody does I'm sure somebody (38:42 - 38:47)
does they're like wait wait why did we (38:44 - 38:48)
why did we send Steve out to Korea he (38:47 - 38:50)
just complains every week about our (38:48 - 38:51)
video (38:50 - 38:53)
game (38:51 - 38:56)
um but they announced a lot of cool (38:53 - 38:57)
things so I think the coolest thing here (38:56 - 39:00)
isn't like origin form Diaga and palia (38:57 - 39:04)
existing I think the cool thing is the (39:00 - 39:07)
abilities they gave it for um what I (39:04 - 39:11)
would say is a hardcore player so we'll (39:07 - 39:13)
we'll go into that let me just tell you (39:11 - 39:17)
what it does so uh origin form Diga and (39:13 - 39:19)
origin form Pia have been discovered in (39:17 - 39:21)
Pokemon go and trainers can encounter (39:19 - 39:23)
them for the first time during SpaceTime (39:21 - 39:25)
anomalies am I saying that word right (39:23 - 39:28)
anomalies that seems like a tough word (39:25 - 39:30)
they changed this by the way from (39:28 - 39:32)
SpaceTime (39:30 - 39:35)
distortions the Pokemon Community loves (39:32 - 39:39)
to abbreviate everything so I think this (39:35 - 39:43)
was an intentional and better change yep (39:39 - 39:45)
they knew they knew what the reaction (39:43 - 39:47)
was going to be there and they changed (39:45 - 39:52)
it probably for the better (39:47 - 39:55)
yeah I I think understanding English (39:52 - 39:57)
audiences maybe a little bit bit better (39:55 - 39:59)
than the Pokemon (39:57 - 40:02)
company so good for (39:59 - 40:04)
them uh the arrival of these legendary (40:02 - 40:07)
Pokemon across uh time and space in (40:04 - 40:09)
Pokemon go introduces a new phenomenon (40:07 - 40:12)
Adventure effects Adventure effects are (40:09 - 40:15)
temporary bonuses that help you on your (40:12 - 40:17)
Pokemon go Adventure activated by (40:15 - 40:19)
powerful Pokemon attacks that may be (40:17 - 40:21)
used outside of battle Adventure effects (40:19 - 40:23)
have been reported to occur when origin (40:21 - 40:26)
form Diaga uses Roar of Time and origin (40:23 - 40:31)
form palia uses spatial Rend uh and (40:26 - 40:34)
so they will make their debut at Pokemon (40:31 - 40:39)
go to orino trainers without an active (40:34 - 40:43)
ticket or the Citywide ex uh trainers (40:39 - 40:46)
without an active ticket to Los Angeles (40:43 - 40:48)
or Citywide gameplay add-on who (40:46 - 40:50)
participate won't be able to encounter a (40:48 - 40:54)
shiny one uh or one that will know its (40:50 - 40:57)
sign urer attack from (40:54 - 40:59)
until (40:57 - 41:04)
C Global tour (40:59 - 41:04)
so I this is fine like I get why they do (41:04 - 41:11)
this because they they had the issue in (41:08 - 41:15)
Vegas but they also came out and said if (41:11 - 41:19)
you remote into Groudon or Kyogre you (41:15 - 41:22)
will not get Mega Energy and that did (41:19 - 41:24)
not stop hundreds of thousands of people (41:22 - 41:27)
coming to that Park tanking that Network (41:24 - 41:29)
and then complaining that they're not (41:27 - 41:32)
getting Mega Energy they did they told (41:29 - 41:33)
you that you weren't going to get Mega (41:32 - 41:35)
Energy unless you weren't a ticket (41:33 - 41:39)
holder so I think they could still get (41:35 - 41:43)
shiny though so I think so so they're (41:39 - 41:46)
like we're turning off the shiny and (41:43 - 41:47)
we're turning off the special moves (41:46 - 41:52)
please don't destroy our they're still (41:47 - 41:54)
relying on people having read this and (41:52 - 41:55)
seeing the (41:54 - 41:58)
communication (41:55 - 42:01)
so whatever like if you if you are not (41:58 - 42:03)
going to this event save your money (42:01 - 42:05)
don't give it to Niantic just literally (42:03 - 42:08)
wait a week and then do your it's fine (42:05 - 42:10)
just don't give your money to that itic (42:08 - 42:12)
just wait one week to you'll you'll get (42:10 - 42:15)
it you just have to wait a week um okay (42:12 - 42:18)
this is what it does Roar of Time uh (42:15 - 42:20)
also it's not guaranteed when you do (42:18 - 42:22)
these raids that it will have Roar of (42:20 - 42:25)
Time I don't know what the percentages (42:22 - 42:27)
is it it it's like the you know the (42:25 - 42:29)
background that you could get like oh (42:27 - 42:31)
you can get like Las Vegas in the (42:29 - 42:33)
background that was never guaranteed I (42:31 - 42:35)
think it was like what a 25% chance or (42:33 - 42:39)
like a 33 it's it was pretty high um so (42:35 - 42:40)
I don't know how high this will be I (42:39 - 42:43)
don't know if it's like a one in 10 or a (42:40 - 42:46)
one in five like we don't know we we'll (42:43 - 42:46)
know when it (42:46 - 42:49)
happens but I'm I'm going to go on a (42:46 - 42:53)
whim and say that if if you're going to (42:49 - 42:56)
Los Angeles and spending all that money (42:53 - 42:58)
you're probably going to be doing a lot (42:56 - 42:59)
of raids you're probably going to be (42:58 - 43:03)
walking away with one of each of (42:59 - 43:05)
these I don't think you're going to have (43:03 - 43:07)
to look too hard uh trainers can (43:05 - 43:09)
activate the adventure incense uh or (43:07 - 43:11)
sorry the adventure effect associated (43:09 - 43:14)
with Roar of Time for 5,000 Stardust and (43:11 - 43:17)
five D alga candy and that will distort (43:14 - 43:19)
time for six minutes pausing the timer (43:17 - 43:22)
on all of the following incense daily (43:19 - 43:24)
Adventure incense lucky egg and star (43:22 - 43:28)
pieces you can extend the Roar of Time (43:24 - 43:31)
Adventure in adventure effect by (43:28 - 43:34)
increments of six minutes uh by using (43:31 - 43:36)
more Stardust and Diga candy the timer (43:34 - 43:39)
can be extended up to two hours each (43:36 - 43:43)
time you tap uh and you can use it again (43:39 - 43:47)
afterwards for a total of 24 (43:43 - 43:49)
hours once the Roar of Time ends the (43:47 - 43:51)
timer on any items will actively (43:49 - 43:54)
continue to count down Roar of Time (43:51 - 43:56)
cannot be activated at the same time as (43:54 - 43:58)
any other Adventure effect so you can't (43:56 - 44:01)
use Roar of Time and spatial Rend at the (43:58 - 44:06)
same time spatial Rend is for palia uh (44:01 - 44:08)
it will also be 5,000 Stardust and five (44:06 - 44:11)
palia candy and it will distort space (44:08 - 44:13)
for 10 minutes allowing en allowing (44:11 - 44:15)
encounters with wild Pokemon at an (44:13 - 44:17)
increased distance you can extend the (44:15 - 44:20)
timer uh by increments of 10 minutes (44:17 - 44:23)
using palia candy and Stardust and it (44:20 - 44:25)
can go up to two hours and then you (44:23 - 44:26)
would have to restart it again but you (44:25 - 44:30)
can go up to 24 hours total (44:26 - 44:33)
and yeah spatial run cannot be used when (44:30 - 44:36)
Roar of Time is active (44:33 - 44:39)
so I think this is really cool I I think (44:36 - 44:41)
that this is definitely designed for the (44:39 - 44:44)
hardcore Pokemon go player and I think (44:41 - 44:46)
in the last year you know we talked (44:44 - 44:50)
about showcases and routes and whatever (44:46 - 44:52)
the other things that ntic released that (44:50 - 44:53)
I can't think of off the top of my head (44:52 - 44:56)
but I really think like routes is more I (44:53 - 44:57)
could I could see why like a hardcore (44:56 - 44:58)
player would be like this is useless to (44:57 - 45:01)
me like I don't want to like it besides (44:58 - 45:04)
getting zygard um but I do think that (45:01 - 45:07)
those are def or party play like those (45:04 - 45:10)
are more towards like come like let's (45:07 - 45:12)
walk a rot together let's play like like (45:10 - 45:14)
I do think those are more casual and (45:12 - 45:15)
that's fine that's (45:14 - 45:17)
totally okay and good there's nothing (45:15 - 45:19)
wrong with like a feature to appeal to (45:17 - 45:22)
Casual people but I I don't think a (45:19 - 45:24)
casual person is going to (45:22 - 45:28)
have hundreds of Dian palia candy and (45:24 - 45:31)
stardust which again I think is fine (45:28 - 45:32)
because I think there this is something (45:31 - 45:34)
for a hardcore player and I think both (45:32 - 45:37)
of these effects are good and powerful (45:34 - 45:40)
in their own (45:37 - 45:42)
way for me it feels a little expensive (45:40 - 45:45)
with the candy usage but I think that (45:42 - 45:46)
for others it feels a little expensive (45:45 - 45:48)
with the Stardust usage so that's (45:46 - 45:50)
probably an individual thing I would be (45:48 - 45:53)
a little bit more excited about them if (45:50 - 45:57)
I didn't know that this is just them (45:53 - 46:00)
cap that the palia adventure effect is (45:57 - 46:02)
just them capitalizing on a bug that (46:00 - 46:03)
happened and made everyone happy and (46:02 - 46:06)
then they was it a BL Hannah or was it (46:03 - 46:08)
an (46:06 - 46:11)
oversight you know um but this this (46:08 - 46:14)
happened for afternoon or two you could (46:11 - 46:17)
see Pokemon in a wider range farther (46:14 - 46:19)
than you usually can and everybody loved (46:17 - 46:22)
it and thought it was a fantastic change (46:19 - 46:24)
and then they took it away and now (46:22 - 46:27)
they've brought it back as something you (46:24 - 46:30)
ultimately kind of have to pay (46:27 - 46:34)
for and that makes me a little sad but (46:30 - 46:35)
it does seem (46:34 - 46:39)
cool yeah I I don't know I don't want to (46:35 - 46:42)
say the palky one's bad because like I (46:39 - 46:44)
wouldn't use it I don't think I would (46:42 - 46:47)
use it as much as the Diga but (46:44 - 46:49)
like I I totally see why people would (46:47 - 46:52)
want the Pia one especially if depending (46:49 - 46:54)
on your area like like if Greg and I (46:52 - 46:56)
went to ball America the piao one is (46:54 - 46:59)
useless to (46:56 - 46:59)
us you're just you there's just so many (46:59 - 47:04)
Pokemon there you just can't tap on all (47:02 - 47:06)
of them fast without like literally (47:04 - 47:08)
stopping you're expanding out to (47:06 - 47:11)
Farmland at that point like what (47:08 - 47:13)
El like you don't the south is far blind (47:11 - 47:16)
to the north is an airport it's not (47:13 - 47:19)
exactly a wide burst any more spawns at (47:16 - 47:22)
Mall of America I think the the Dio one (47:19 - 47:26)
is so cool like if you like because I (47:22 - 47:28)
think the Diago one is like the hardcore (47:26 - 47:30)
of hardcore players if you are willing (47:28 - 47:33)
to spend 80 cents on a lucky egg and (47:30 - 47:36)
a149 on a star piece and then you pop (47:33 - 47:38)
your incense like a lot of hardcore (47:36 - 47:41)
players activate all three of those at (47:38 - 47:43)
the same time and to be able to pause (47:41 - 47:47)
that to get more out of that for (47:43 - 47:49)
ultimately free like the free is like (47:47 - 47:50)
you're just playing the game so you have (47:49 - 47:52)
all the Stardust and you have all the (47:50 - 47:54)
like I think that's so cool like I don't (47:52 - 47:55)
know how often I would use it but (47:54 - 47:57)
there's definitely been situations where (47:55 - 48:00)
it's like oh man I I just need like 10 (47:57 - 48:04)
more minutes and to to be able to extend (48:00 - 48:06)
all three of those pretty easily I think (48:04 - 48:08)
there's another thing where like I fall (48:06 - 48:10)
into as like maybe I I don't even think (48:08 - 48:11)
I'm like that hardcore a player but I (48:10 - 48:14)
have like 2,000 rare candy and like I (48:11 - 48:17)
never know what to put them into like I (48:14 - 48:19)
like I don't need any like I if I played (48:17 - 48:22)
Master League I guess I would put them (48:19 - 48:26)
into that stuff but like I have so many (48:22 - 48:29)
raid counters that like I don't I don't (48:26 - 48:30)
need to like power something up to like (48:29 - 48:32)
get a good raid counter like I have (48:30 - 48:34)
zerude maxed out I have Cartana maxed (48:32 - 48:36)
out I have rush ram like I have (48:34 - 48:38)
everything like maxed out that I need (48:36 - 48:39)
for raid (48:38 - 48:42)
counters so really at this point I'm (48:39 - 48:44)
just powering up Pokemon (48:42 - 48:47)
that like I guess guess I could use like (48:44 - 48:49)
the rare candy to be like haha I got I (48:47 - 48:52)
got to Titan like right away but even (48:49 - 48:54)
even that case when a new Pokemon gets (48:52 - 48:56)
introduced it's pretty easy to like (48:54 - 48:57)
pinap and (48:56 - 49:00)
just collect enough candy to evolve it (48:57 - 49:02)
so like I never use it on New Pokemon (49:00 - 49:05)
either so to me it's like oh if I just (49:02 - 49:09)
put 20 rare candy into Diga I now have (49:05 - 49:11)
24 (49:09 - 49:15)
minutes like I I doubled my my my egg (49:11 - 49:19)
and my star piece um well technically 25 (49:15 - 49:22)
uh but I think that's so cool so I (49:19 - 49:23)
totally get the complaints of like (49:22 - 49:25)
people being like Oh I would never use (49:23 - 49:28)
it (49:25 - 49:28)
it's definitely definitely designed (49:28 - 49:33)
around hardcore people for sure um but I (49:30 - 49:34)
also get Hannah's complain of like it's (49:33 - 49:36)
kind of expensive I do think it's (49:34 - 49:38)
expensive but I I I think they're doing (49:36 - 49:41)
the Mega Evolution thing where like (49:38 - 49:43)
minus maybe Mega Evolution being bad but (49:41 - 49:45)
like Mega Evolution was initially like (49:43 - 49:47)
really really expensive and they like (49:45 - 49:49)
revamped it I think they would have (49:47 - 49:52)
revamped it anyways I think this is like (49:49 - 49:53)
just a common game thing of like we'll (49:52 - 49:55)
introduce it to be expensive and then a (49:53 - 49:57)
year later will make it slightly cheaper (49:55 - 49:59)
and like I'm sure in like another year (49:57 - 50:01)
though like when you do a route you'll (49:59 - 50:03)
get like 10 zygard cells instead of one (50:01 - 50:05)
like I'm sure that's a thing that's (50:03 - 50:07)
going to happen because they just they (50:05 - 50:09)
just make they're just like we have to (50:07 - 50:11)
introduce a new currency so we'll make (50:09 - 50:14)
the old currency kind of worthless um so (50:11 - 50:15)
I I do think that it will eventually be (50:14 - 50:18)
cheaper in like a year or two but like (50:15 - 50:20)
right now (50:18 - 50:24)
it's it's a little expensive but here's (50:20 - 50:26)
hoping and I think it's funny that they (50:24 - 50:28)
obviously know the dialo one is more (50:26 - 50:30)
powerful since that one only goes 6 (50:28 - 50:33)
minutes at a time where the CIO one goes (50:30 - 50:35)
10 minutes at a (50:33 - 50:38)
time I don't I I would love to be in (50:35 - 50:41)
that like room and be like how are we (50:38 - 50:44)
deciding the exact time how did you get (50:41 - 50:48)
six and 10 I don't know I mean so it's (50:44 - 50:50)
interesting because if you go for an (50:48 - 50:54)
hour that you have to do it 10 times for (50:50 - 50:56)
or of time and only six times for (50:54 - 50:58)
spatial rent like it's based off of an (50:56 - 51:02)
hour yeah it is but (50:58 - 51:02)
like six minutes is not a like doing (51:03 - 51:10)
multiples of six in your (51:08 - 51:14)
head is unless you a school rock fan (51:10 - 51:16)
like I am is probably not something that (51:14 - 51:20)
you do regularly like six and then (51:16 - 51:23)
what's after what do you six time 2 (51:20 - 51:28)
is 12 I get to 24 and then what happens (51:23 - 51:31)
at 4 something right well it's it's (51:28 - 51:35)
interesting that um like we did get that (51:31 - 51:37)
what like 48 Hours of like increased (51:35 - 51:40)
spawns and then Niantic was like oh (51:37 - 51:42)
that's didn't Niantic say like it was (51:40 - 51:43)
working as intended and then like two (51:42 - 51:45)
days later they were like oh sorry it (51:43 - 51:48)
wasn't working as intended they they (51:45 - 51:50)
told a creator that it was working as (51:48 - 51:52)
intended they spread that word and then (51:50 - 51:56)
Nan got to say nope nope that's not (51:52 - 52:00)
supposed to happen yeah uh and then the (51:56 - 52:02)
other thing that Niantic like messed up (52:00 - 52:06)
was uh white kierum and black kierum (52:02 - 52:08)
appeared in go battle leag for a hot (52:06 - 52:12)
second so I do Wonder so like when when (52:08 - 52:15)
these issues happen I don't think it's (52:12 - 52:18)
like I don't think it's like they that (52:15 - 52:19)
somebody accidentally pressed a button (52:18 - 52:23)
I'm sure they were testing things like (52:19 - 52:25)
like were they expanding the spawns (52:23 - 52:28)
because they were testing this specific (52:25 - 52:31)
feature and then somebody was like ah (52:28 - 52:33)
this like like yeah it is working as (52:31 - 52:37)
intended if you had origin form pcia (52:33 - 52:39)
active that's not in the game yet so (52:37 - 52:44)
it's like why did kierum just randomly (52:39 - 52:47)
appear in GBL do they also have some (52:44 - 52:51)
sort of abilities like Diga and palia (52:47 - 52:54)
here which I think like maybe that's (52:51 - 52:57)
like me putting a foil had on but I feel (52:54 - 53:00)
like that kind of makes sense otherwise (52:57 - 53:02)
like why did they just pop up like why (53:00 - 53:05)
were they even yeah there and then the (53:02 - 53:07)
other thing that happened this week is (53:05 - 53:09)
for (53:07 - 53:13)
the um fairy event Rayquaza's silhouette (53:09 - 53:15)
appeared in (53:13 - 53:17)
eggs so you know how it's supposed to be (53:15 - 53:21)
like Clea Igglybuff elid well where (53:17 - 53:24)
Pichu was supposed to be Rayquaza was (53:21 - 53:26)
there now Rayquaza never hatched from an (53:24 - 53:30)
egg but if you're thinking about the c (53:26 - 53:35)
tour there is an egg mythical legendary (53:30 - 53:39)
that technically appears in CNO which is (53:35 - 53:44)
fion so like what other reason would (53:39 - 53:47)
Rayquaza just a random legendary appear (53:44 - 53:51)
in an egg temporarily if they're not (53:47 - 53:55)
testing a fion is mythical but like (53:51 - 53:58)
technically under the legendary umbrella (53:55 - 54:00)
um why would a random legendary (53:58 - 54:02)
silhouette appear in an egg if it wasn't (54:00 - 54:04)
for testing for that I'm not saying that (54:02 - 54:06)
like oh that means for sure manife and (54:04 - 54:09)
Fiona are coming to Cog go (54:06 - 54:12)
tour but like it's coming eventually (54:09 - 54:14)
whether it's this year or next year and (54:12 - 54:17)
like there's no way that fion isn't (54:14 - 54:19)
going to be in an egg that's its whole (54:17 - 54:23)
gimmick is the hatch from an egg yeah (54:19 - 54:26)
yeah it needs to although so yes there's (54:23 - 54:28)
all the testing that's probably (54:26 - 54:30)
happening but you did kind of hint at (54:28 - 54:33)
other Pokemon with special moves kind of (54:30 - 54:35)
like Diaga and Palkia are getting here (54:33 - 54:38)
and they did say in (54:35 - 54:41)
that uh press release saying there may (54:38 - 54:43)
be other Adventure effects discovered in (54:41 - 54:46)
the future I think those are so cool (54:43 - 54:48)
like I think Adventure like like if they (54:46 - 54:51)
have more Adventure effects like I think (54:48 - 54:53)
that is so like we talked about this (54:51 - 54:56)
last week of like what can Niantic do (54:53 - 54:58)
like I think these are really cool again (54:56 - 55:00)
expensive totally expensive especially (54:58 - 55:01)
for a casual player but I do think they (55:00 - 55:04)
are really cool for a hardcore player um (55:01 - 55:06)
and the amount of times where I'm like (55:04 - 55:08)
man I just wish I had five more minutes (55:06 - 55:11)
on my incense before like Community day (55:08 - 55:14)
is over or before like oh I should have (55:11 - 55:15)
evolved all these Pokemon and now my (55:14 - 55:17)
lucky egg is about to wear (55:15 - 55:19)
out (55:17 - 55:21)
um yeah like I don't know what other (55:19 - 55:23)
ones they would do like and now I'm (55:21 - 55:24)
trying to think of like if they (55:23 - 55:26)
introduced two other ones with Kum like (55:24 - 55:27)
what would they even be because I think (55:26 - 55:30)
these are both powerful in their (55:27 - 55:33)
own respects (55:30 - 55:35)
MH (55:33 - 55:39)
um but I could again yeah I could easily (55:35 - 55:40)
see people being like I'll never use (55:39 - 55:41)
that feature I mean we see so many (55:40 - 55:43)
players never even use Mega Evolution (55:41 - 55:45)
and there's really (55:43 - 55:48)
like there's really no penalty for (55:45 - 55:50)
turning Mega Evolution on unless you (55:48 - 55:51)
just don't have the energy but I know (55:50 - 55:53)
you all have Beedrill just turn Beedrill (55:51 - 55:56)
on literally anytime you're out for like (55:53 - 55:59)
eight hours you'll just get more candy (55:56 - 56:02)
yeah uh although assumption to say (55:59 - 56:04)
everyone has Beedrill you get the energy (56:02 - 56:07)
from spinning gems that's a very safe (56:04 - 56:09)
assumption although Knight is going to (56:07 - 56:11)
have to rework that sidebar because I (56:09 - 56:13)
feel like right now there's just like (56:11 - 56:17)
incense rocket radar star piece lucky (56:13 - 56:19)
egg Mega you gotten it so it it doubles (56:17 - 56:22)
up and there are two of the (56:19 - 56:24)
sidebars they really they really got to (56:22 - 56:27)
figure out something to do with that (56:24 - 56:27)
sidebar white kierum will in increase (56:28 - 56:34)
the visibility of the Side Bar when (56:31 - 56:38)
active it will cost you five (56:34 - 56:38)
candy uh all right the other Pokemon Go (56:38 - 56:45)
News uh is that it is still related to (56:40 - 56:49)
the um Cog go tour they announced that (56:45 - 56:52)
if you do Party play at Cog go tour oh (56:49 - 56:55)
and Cog Global it should be for both (56:52 - 56:57)
that you will have a chance of getting (56:55 - 57:01)
Reggie gigas which I guess is (56:57 - 57:03)
cool (57:01 - 57:05)
um that you don't have to do a raid for (57:03 - 57:07)
a legendary Pokemon you'll just have to (57:05 - 57:08)
I I don't know what the extent is I'm (57:07 - 57:11)
assuming it's like a mission like you (57:08 - 57:14)
have however long for the four of you or (57:11 - 57:15)
the two of you to like go through and (57:14 - 57:17)
then at the very end Reggie gigs pops up (57:15 - 57:19)
so that's like a really cool use of (57:17 - 57:21)
party play because right (57:19 - 57:24)
now catching 30 Pokemon for two (57:21 - 57:28)
pokeballs is not a great like task for (57:24 - 57:30)
party play yeah no the best use for (57:28 - 57:32)
party play that I have had is just (57:30 - 57:34)
whenever I'm going out and doing raids (57:32 - 57:36)
with friends always make sure we're in a (57:34 - 57:39)
party to get that little extra boost and (57:36 - 57:43)
that's about it yes so um so if you are (57:39 - 57:46)
going to the global c tour which is (57:43 - 57:49)
anywhere you want um sounds like you'll (57:46 - 57:50)
be able to get a Reggie gigas if you (57:49 - 57:52)
don't already have one which is pretty (57:50 - 57:54)
cool uh they're introducing white stripe (57:52 - 57:58)
basket into routes so not only will you (57:54 - 58:00)
be able to oh sorry well party plan (57:58 - 58:02)
routes now I think (58:00 - 58:04)
work I don't I don't think you have to (58:02 - 58:06)
pick or choose one of those I think they (58:04 - 58:09)
do work so if you do a route you get a (58:06 - 58:11)
basin so that's cool I don't know if (58:09 - 58:13)
that's going to like make the zygard (58:11 - 58:15)
cell disappear (58:13 - 58:18)
because hopefully not I mean they have (58:15 - 58:20)
the zygard cell and Mato working at the (58:18 - 58:22)
same time so now they just have to add (58:20 - 58:27)
basculin too oh boy (58:22 - 58:27)
they're saying that um the shiny starter (58:27 - 58:35)
Pokemon which are six of them the three (58:32 - 58:39)
from CNO and then the three from Legends (58:35 - 58:42)
archus will have increased shiny the (58:39 - 58:44)
costume Pokemon will be increased shiny (58:42 - 58:47)
and then stunky the only gen one of the (58:44 - 58:49)
only Gen 4 Pokemon that have not been (58:47 - 58:52)
shiny will have an increased chance of (58:49 - 58:53)
shiny (58:52 - 58:55)
so um (58:53 - 59:01)
that will be for both Global and (58:55 - 59:03)
La they're saying that uh they are (59:01 - 59:06)
bringing the huian Pokemon which was (59:03 - 59:07)
what a big complaint of like why aren't (59:06 - 59:10)
they doing huian they are and they are (59:07 - 59:13)
turning huan Voltorb and asuan quilf (59:10 - 59:15)
shiny that will be their shiny (59:13 - 59:17)
debut um and those Pokemon will those (59:15 - 59:20)
two Pokemon specifically will be in eggs (59:17 - 59:24)
so eggs during the c tour Global will (59:20 - 59:26)
have I think the 7K eggs we'll have (59:24 - 59:29)
shiny huin voltor shiny huin quilf (59:26 - 59:31)
carnivine Pachirisu and catat so the (59:29 - 59:34)
Regionals will also be in eggs uh you (59:31 - 59:35)
could maybe argue that that's kind of a (59:34 - 59:36)
bad thing because it's making the (59:35 - 59:40)
Regionals a little bit harder to get uh (59:36 - 59:44)
but I don't know I think it's a I think (59:40 - 59:45)
it's a good pool they're all pretty (59:44 - 59:46)
desirable (59:45 - 59:48)
shinies (59:46 - 59:51)
yeah (59:48 - 59:55)
uh three stars will feature huian de (59:51 - 59:59)
huian samarat huian tyion one Stars will (59:55 - 60:00)
feature the (59:59 - 60:03)
starters five stars will obviously be (60:00 - 60:04)
Diago (60:03 - 60:10)
palia um The sneez Grow huan sneez huan (60:04 - 60:13)
growth huan voltor pan quilf will be (60:10 - 60:15)
spawning in the wild um unknown will be (60:13 - 60:18)
off of incense and it spells (60:15 - 60:20)
hi (60:18 - 60:22)
Su (60:20 - 60:24)
Ki I think they're just missing an eye (60:22 - 60:27)
there but yeah repeat letters uh they (60:24 - 60:31)
all have a chance to be shiny um so yeah (60:27 - 60:33)
they I think I think most people were (60:31 - 60:35)
already made up if if they were going to (60:33 - 60:37)
LA or not I think there were a lot of (60:35 - 60:41)
people maybe like looking at so Global (60:37 - 60:43)
tour and being like this looks very (60:41 - 60:45)
lackluster I think everything they've (60:43 - 60:49)
announced makes it way more appealing so (60:45 - 60:51)
I don't think this was like a panic (60:49 - 60:53)
switch of like oh I think they were just (60:51 - 60:56)
holding that stuff (60:53 - 60:58)
like oh no people don't like our C event (60:56 - 61:02)
quick release (60:58 - 61:02)
thei we hoped we didn't have to pull the (61:03 - 61:10)
lever but we do we quick get Reggie (61:06 - 61:14)
gigas here people need him I mean regy (61:10 - 61:16)
gig has just had a slow start right oh (61:14 - 61:20)
my gosh uh no word of archus no word of (61:16 - 61:21)
manife no word of (61:20 - 61:24)
fion uh I could see them totally (61:21 - 61:26)
skipping arist because they don't know (61:24 - 61:27)
how to do (61:26 - 61:29)
it I (61:27 - 61:34)
do something interesting though (61:29 - 61:37)
okay I think they might be introducing (61:34 - 61:40)
archus into (61:37 - 61:45)
Masters you think there is a weird (61:40 - 61:48)
Stone thing so there's a mysterious (61:45 - 61:50)
Stone event that's underneath the (61:48 - 61:53)
regular so if you go into the storyline (61:50 - 61:55)
you can follow the mysterious Stone (61:53 - 61:57)
storyline so there's random mysterious (61:55 - 61:59)
stones that that you trade in for (61:57 - 62:01)
treasures and they have (61:59 - 62:05)
been dropping little bits of the story (62:01 - 62:06)
like hey where are all these Stones (62:05 - 62:08)
coming from and they don't do the same (62:06 - 62:09)
thing as everything else the one that (62:08 - 62:11)
dropped most (62:09 - 62:15)
recently Rey who's the charact the male (62:11 - 62:17)
character from Legends (62:15 - 62:21)
archus gets a strange Vision message and (62:17 - 62:22)
the last thing he says is that voice (62:21 - 62:25)
sounds familiar or or something I'm like (62:22 - 62:27)
oh I know that voice and then it pans up (62:25 - 62:30)
to the sky and I'm (62:27 - 62:33)
like so what what do we so they're (62:30 - 62:36)
fin for legends archus that all the (62:33 - 62:40)
YouTubers told us ah so I think they're (62:36 - 62:41)
I the question is if they're adding it (62:40 - 62:46)
in as a pair you bond with is this (62:41 - 62:48)
another one that your character will (62:46 - 62:50)
bond with or if they're intering it to (62:48 - 62:52)
one of the existing characters I have a (62:50 - 62:54)
feeling it's one that you will bond with (62:52 - 62:56)
with but yeah that was the most recent (62:54 - 62:59)
sort of mysterious Stone thing is I (62:56 - 63:00)
think they're hinting towards arus (62:59 - 63:02)
coming into (63:00 - 63:06)
Masters H interesting I want to be (63:02 - 63:08)
hopeful (63:06 - 63:13)
that they do release like a 100K egg or (63:08 - 63:16)
something that is like manife or fion (63:13 - 63:17)
like I don't know how else they would do (63:16 - 63:18)
that I mean we've we we've been talking (63:17 - 63:20)
about this for like two three years of (63:18 - 63:22)
like there's no way they don't release (63:20 - 63:25)
like just a very big egg (63:22 - 63:27)
that (63:25 - 63:27)
is well I guess manife comes from an egg (63:28 - 63:32)
too you get manife from the Mystery (63:30 - 63:36)
Dungeon yeah yeah it's like a blue egg (63:32 - 63:37)
it's like a blue egg with like a red dot (63:36 - 63:38)
on (63:37 - 63:41)
it so I I do want to be like oh that (63:38 - 63:43)
would be I like I do think that would be (63:41 - 63:45)
like the cherry on the top for this (63:43 - 63:47)
event because CNO does not have a lot (63:45 - 63:50)
going for it also we are all exhausted (63:47 - 63:52)
from C you gave us bdsp you gave us (63:50 - 63:53)
Legends we're we're all a little (63:52 - 63:57)
exhausted yeah so I do feel like having (63:53 - 63:59)
like a like a special egg or something (63:57 - 64:04)
to like get manife would be like of if (63:59 - 64:06)
you're not going to give us archus at (64:04 - 64:09)
least give us (64:06 - 64:11)
this but I guess they could hold that (64:09 - 64:15)
for like a go Fest since they we still (64:11 - 64:17)
don't have the garan starters they can (64:15 - 64:19)
hold whatever Pokemon they want for (64:17 - 64:21)
whenever yeah that's (64:19 - 64:25)
true this is like the first (64:21 - 64:28)
this is like the first Pokedex that you (64:25 - 64:30)
won't be able to complete though like (64:28 - 64:33)
for hoen that was everything right yeah (64:30 - 64:36)
yep and then obviously Kanto and and (64:33 - 64:38)
jotto was everything so this for being (64:36 - 64:39)
the (64:38 - 64:41)
smallest for being one of the smallest (64:39 - 64:43)
pokedexes it's the one we still won't be (64:41 - 64:44)
able to (64:43 - 64:47)
complete um but I don't know whatever uh (64:44 - 64:49)
the white stripe cannot evolve for (64:47 - 64:52)
whatever reason currently so just a (64:49 - 64:54)
heads up Niantic has confirmed that that (64:52 - 64:57)
the white stripe masculine cannot (64:54 - 65:01)
evolve uh sure they can also decide what (64:57 - 65:04)
can and cannot evolve apparently too (65:01 - 65:06)
because that's (65:04 - 65:09)
Niantic uh speaking of Pokemon that can (65:06 - 65:12)
evolve a nyip is coming to raids I think (65:09 - 65:17)
next week so that's something again they (65:12 - 65:19)
like we'll just skip all of Galler and (65:17 - 65:22)
just focus on (65:19 - 65:24)
uh Focus well which is like fine I mean (65:22 - 65:27)
like Pala is here so might as well do (65:24 - 65:30)
Pala stuff I mean they can't release (65:27 - 65:32)
Galler stuff until the soundtrack's (65:30 - 65:34)
finally released that's true yeah watch (65:32 - 65:36)
the soundtrack get (65:34 - 65:40)
delayed uh you can you can evolve (65:36 - 65:43)
primape into a nyap after defeating 30 (65:40 - 65:45)
ghost or psychic type in battle with (65:43 - 65:48)
primape as your buddy (65:45 - 65:52)
so they solved that I guess that (65:48 - 65:54)
surprise who knows if we'll ever be a (65:52 - 65:59)
able to evolve uh like the sui without (65:54 - 66:02)
doing a raid for it but at least in this (65:59 - 66:05)
instance they solved it yep you can (66:02 - 66:07)
evolve into annihilate not going to be (66:05 - 66:11)
able to evolve into Cleaver but (66:07 - 66:14)
sure I was gonna say yeah Weir deer you (66:11 - 66:19)
also can't do Weir deer either right no (66:14 - 66:19)
yeah uh there is the dazzling dream (66:19 - 66:23)
event that is happening right now uh (66:21 - 66:25)
it's very short it's not nearly as good (66:23 - 66:27)
as the fery event last (66:25 - 66:30)
year um I I think there's an argument to (66:27 - 66:35)
be had about the egg collection (66:30 - 66:37)
challenge where I think both sides are (66:35 - 66:39)
right I'm on the side where like it (66:37 - 66:40)
doesn't matter there's the other side (66:39 - 66:42)
that's like I can't believe they put a (66:40 - 66:45)
collection challenge between egg pay (66:42 - 66:47)
wall (66:45 - 66:50)
which incubators are free here here's (66:47 - 66:52)
Here's my thought why I like don't think (66:50 - 66:55)
it matters I I think I think a lot of (66:52 - 66:58)
this comes from just Americans and I (66:55 - 67:00)
totally get it we live in a very car (66:58 - 67:03)
Centric world when I was in Japan or (67:00 - 67:05)
even when I was in Chicago last week and (67:03 - 67:08)
I walked everywhere I was hatching like (67:05 - 67:10)
three eggs a day with my like free (67:08 - 67:11)
incubator just because I was walking (67:10 - 67:15)
everywhere and just because like it like (67:11 - 67:17)
I I don't I hatch one egg a week mostly (67:15 - 67:19)
one because I don't leave my house but (67:17 - 67:20)
mostly two cuz I have to drive (67:19 - 67:22)
everywhere and if I'm hatching that one (67:20 - 67:23)
egg it's probably cuz I'm driving to (67:22 - 67:26)
mall America and then I'm walking in a (67:23 - 67:30)
circle so like I do I do think like (67:26 - 67:32)
there is like this American perspective (67:30 - 67:34)
of and it's not a perspective it's a (67:32 - 67:36)
reality where we everything just we need (67:34 - 67:38)
to access everything on cars so if we (67:36 - 67:41)
want to hatch an egg we have to like (67:38 - 67:42)
actively like think about like we need (67:41 - 67:44)
to go play Pokemon go and hatch an egg (67:42 - 67:47)
whereas like if we just like if you when (67:44 - 67:49)
I was in Chicago and I was like taking (67:47 - 67:51)
the subway and I was just walking around (67:49 - 67:52)
because everything was just right there (67:51 - 67:56)
downtown Chicago just I'm hatching eggs (67:52 - 67:57)
left and right I'm catching shinies left (67:56 - 68:00)
and right like like like I say this all (67:57 - 68:04)
the time but there is just an unbalance (68:00 - 68:06)
in this game based off where you live (68:04 - 68:09)
and that's that and we we've made the (68:06 - 68:10)
joke of like that's also how Tinder (68:09 - 68:12)
works like if you live in the middle of (68:10 - 68:14)
nowhere you're only going to get like (68:12 - 68:16)
two people to showing up on Tinder (68:14 - 68:17)
versus if you live in the city this is a (68:16 - 68:20)
very dating episode show Welcome to (68:17 - 68:23)
Episode 600 seriously here's the other (68:20 - 68:24)
thing about the like the collection (68:23 - 68:26)
challenge cuz I think you need what (68:24 - 68:29)
Togepi spritzy swirlx and cuti fly in (68:26 - 68:31)
order to get the the collection (68:29 - 68:34)
challenge means nothing it it like to be (68:31 - 68:36)
like oh they hid it behind a pay wall (68:34 - 68:39)
your ju your number just goes up and you (68:36 - 68:42)
already you say that but I bet you still (68:39 - 68:45)
regret those ones you've missed I do I (68:42 - 68:48)
mean yeah I do but like like I you can't (68:45 - 68:50)
get them all anyways like you like there (68:48 - 68:52)
was one's exclusive to Barcelona there (68:50 - 68:54)
was one's exclusive to South Korea mexic (68:52 - 68:56)
me you like I was like twitch chat what (68:54 - 68:58)
is your collection Challenge and twitch (68:56 - 69:00)
chat was like oh like I'm at 60 or I'm (68:58 - 69:04)
at 30 or like I'm at 70 I'm at (69:00 - 69:08)
130 like what what does it matter if (69:04 - 69:10)
like I don't get this collection CH I do (69:08 - 69:11)
want to get this collection challenge (69:10 - 69:14)
what does it matter if I don't get (69:11 - 69:16)
this what does it matter if I'm going (69:14 - 69:20)
from 130 to 131 like I don't like it (69:16 - 69:23)
doesn't matter spoiler none of it does (69:20 - 69:24)
yeah none of it like nothing is tied to (69:23 - 69:26)
it (69:24 - 69:28)
like I'm going to get this collection (69:26 - 69:30)
challenge to prove you all (69:28 - 69:33)
wrong but like don't like don't feel (69:30 - 69:35)
pressured by Niantic to be like Oh I'm (69:33 - 69:36)
going to miss out on this collection (69:35 - 69:38)
challenge like there's nothing tied to (69:36 - 69:41)
it your number just goes up it's not (69:38 - 69:43)
that big of a deal as a person (69:41 - 69:46)
that's has only ever done collection (69:43 - 69:51)
challenges by pure (69:46 - 69:51)
accident it's not that big of a deal (69:51 - 69:57)
yeah like that's my whole point is like (69:55 - 69:59)
like I can totally see the argument of (69:57 - 70:02)
like this thing is paywalled but when (69:59 - 70:05)
you say like what are they pay Walling (70:02 - 70:06)
and then you break it down to it's just (70:05 - 70:09)
a number going (70:06 - 70:12)
up like it's it's kind of a your (70:09 - 70:13)
argument kind of falls apart because (70:12 - 70:15)
you're really not we have said on the (70:13 - 70:17)
show before though number get big good (70:15 - 70:19)
yeah yeah number get big good yeah yeah (70:17 - 70:21)
no I'm I'm I'm all into number getting (70:19 - 70:26)
big number getting big good yes 100% (70:21 - 70:26)
but but as a person who has only ever (70:28 - 70:34)
accidentally completed them you're fine (70:32 - 70:37)
you can do it with it not going to hurt (70:34 - 70:39)
you if you don't get yeah don't like I I (70:37 - 70:41)
do think the actual unfair thing here (70:39 - 70:43)
isn't the like four Pokemon in eggs I (70:41 - 70:45)
think the unfair thing is this event is (70:43 - 70:49)
three days like why why why is it not a (70:45 - 70:51)
week that doesn't (70:49 - 70:52)
help (70:51 - 70:55)
like I mean the the real unfair thing is (70:52 - 70:57)
Niantic decided to release an egg (70:55 - 70:59)
collection challenge when it's -14 (70:57 - 71:01)
degrees outside yep I don't know who I (70:59 - 71:04)
need to email here but how dare they not (71:01 - 71:06)
consider the (71:04 - 71:09)
weather uh okay we're gonna take one (71:06 - 71:12)
more break uh and then (71:09 - 71:15)
um and then we will uh wrap up our show (71:12 - 71:19)
so we will be right (71:15 - 71:19)
back (71:23 - 71:26)
[Music] (71:27 - 71:30)
and we are back from our break all right (71:33 - 71:41)
uh there there was a lot of things that (71:38 - 71:43)
didn't come together for the 600 episode (71:41 - 71:44)
obviously we talked about that at the (71:43 - 71:48)
beginning no surprise here (71:44 - 71:52)
uh but uh but there's there's been a lot (71:48 - 71:56)
of talk about the 600 club and so I (71:52 - 71:58)
thought that was very fitting also shout (71:56 - 72:01)
out to uh my mod who suggested that you (71:58 - 72:03)
should talk about the 600 Club on the (72:01 - 72:05)
600 episode so I think we should I think (72:03 - 72:07)
that's great I think that's a Full (72:05 - 72:14)
Circle so um the 600 Club is what the (72:07 - 72:17)
Japanese players call pseudo legendaries (72:14 - 72:20)
so oh okay okay I see what you're (72:17 - 72:23)
talking I'm like what canot be the (72:20 - 72:26)
religious TV show that we're def like I (72:23 - 72:28)
can be part of this conversation if it (72:26 - 72:31)
is we've talked too much about Tinder (72:28 - 72:33)
for this to be a religious (72:31 - 72:37)
episode too much dating and origin forms (72:33 - 72:41)
um so there there has been debate about (72:37 - 72:44)
the 600 Club SL pseudo legendaries (72:41 - 72:47)
because of arch (72:44 - 72:50)
aladon uh because Americans well first (72:47 - 72:52)
off pseudo legendaries is a madeup fan (72:50 - 72:54)
term it's not acknowledged by the PO (72:52 - 72:57)
at all uh so if you don't know what the (72:54 - 72:59)
pseudo legendaries are they are Pokemon (72:57 - 73:01)
with the base stat total of 600 so the (72:59 - 73:03)
very first one would have been Dragonite (73:01 - 73:06)
and then the other quote unquote rule (73:03 - 73:09)
that somebody decided that everyone (73:06 - 73:12)
agreed to follow is it was a three-stage (73:09 - 73:15)
Evolution and I I'm sure at one point it (73:12 - 73:17)
was probably dragon Pokemon there's a (73:15 - 73:19)
Pokemon that broke that which was (73:17 - 73:22)
Metagross which is part of the 600 Club (73:19 - 73:25)
so in gen one you have night uh and then (73:22 - 73:28)
in Gen 2 Tyranitar is part of that right (73:25 - 73:30)
I guess Tyranitar broke that right away (73:28 - 73:31)
no Tyranitar is not (73:30 - 73:35)
600 Tyranitar is part of that oh okay (73:31 - 73:37)
well he's he's kind of like a dragon (73:35 - 73:40)
except he's not he's a (73:37 - 73:40)
dinosaur so you have Tyranitar you have (73:40 - 73:46)
Metagross you have salamance uh you have (73:43 - 73:47)
Hy Dragon (73:46 - 73:50)
hydragon um I'm trying to name him off (73:47 - 73:51)
the top of my head I'm sure Greg has a (73:50 - 73:54)
list in front of them (73:51 - 73:56)
do (73:54 - 73:59)
I Craig you want to do the list all (73:56 - 74:02)
right uh Dragonite Tyranitar hels (73:59 - 74:05)
Metagross Garchomp hydron Goodra and (74:02 - 74:11)
huan Goodra KOMO dragapult backx (74:05 - 74:14)
caliber yes and so all of those Pokemon (74:11 - 74:17)
are most of those Pokemon are Dragon not (74:14 - 74:19)
all of them they all have this the the (74:17 - 74:22)
600 base stat total and they all have (74:19 - 74:25)
three stage evolution (74:22 - 74:29)
and that's like the whatever the (74:25 - 74:33)
rules and so now uh duraladon evolves (74:29 - 74:37)
into Arch Arch aladon and Arch aladon (74:33 - 74:40)
has a base that total of 600 but it's (74:37 - 74:43)
not a three-stage Evolution so the the (74:40 - 74:46)
big discourse here is does it fall under (74:43 - 74:49)
a pseudo legendary Pokemon I do want to (74:46 - 74:51)
know your guys's (74:49 - 74:54)
opinion my opinion is wholehearted yes I (74:51 - 74:56)
love that they are breaking these fan (74:54 - 74:59)
terms and I think it's (74:56 - 74:59)
hilarious the staple remover is a pseudo (75:00 - 75:07)
legendary I mean yeah I mean I hate the (75:02 - 75:11)
design but like I can't (75:07 - 75:11)
so stat-wise I I I think I think the (75:13 - 75:18)
defining (75:17 - 75:23)
feature of a pseudo legendary isn't the (75:18 - 75:26)
Evolution stages I think it is the (75:23 - 75:29)
ending stats I think as long as it can (75:26 - 75:34)
hit 600 I think that is what defines for (75:29 - 75:36)
whatever for a term that ultimately what (75:34 - 75:39)
is it again we are this is one of the (75:36 - 75:41)
things where we're terming (75:39 - 75:44)
something for what reason what does that (75:41 - 75:49)
give us what if it's not stating this (75:44 - 75:52)
has a 600 Stat or (75:49 - 75:54)
higher what does the term legendary do (75:52 - 75:57)
for us because the only relevant (75:54 - 76:01)
conversation in that is the (75:57 - 76:03)
stats because all (76:01 - 76:07)
the that's why I think the 600 club that (76:03 - 76:09)
the je the Japanese players say I think (76:07 - 76:11)
that's way better than pseudo (76:09 - 76:13)
legendaries I the terms are slightly (76:11 - 76:16)
different that pseudo legendaries have (76:13 - 76:18)
always had more requirements which is (76:16 - 76:21)
why Arch audon fits into 600 Club much (76:18 - 76:23)
more easily than it does fit into pseudo (76:21 - 76:24)
but I'm perfectly willing to break apart (76:23 - 76:26)
the pseudo term and just say yep they (76:24 - 76:28)
did this very (76:26 - 76:31)
intentionally but again what is pseudo (76:28 - 76:36)
legendary telling us like what is (76:31 - 76:36)
that what is that term doing for us I (76:37 - 76:43)
think I think pseudo legendary I think (76:41 - 76:45)
ideally it's telling you that there's a (76:43 - 76:47)
there's a Pokemon that is not a (76:45 - 76:49)
legendary that is as strong as a (76:47 - 76:51)
legendary cuz Mew has a base stat total (76:49 - 76:54)
of 600 Latios ltio has a base stat total (76:51 - 76:57)
of 600 fun fact a lot of Mega Pokemon (76:54 - 77:00)
like Alakazam or pinor I don't know why (76:57 - 77:04)
I said pinor so funny pinor pinor P they (77:00 - 77:06)
have a base St total of 600 when they (77:04 - 77:09)
Mega Evolve when I was growing up I (77:06 - 77:10)
always thought (77:09 - 77:17)
like oh w i as a as a child I guess um I (77:10 - 77:19)
I didn't think about bat total I just I (77:17 - 77:21)
just heard the term oh pseudo legendary (77:19 - 77:23)
oh these are powerful Pokémon and to (77:21 - 77:25)
catch that are not legendary but are on (77:23 - 77:29)
the power level of a legendary Pokémon (77:25 - 77:32)
and then when you realize that oh the (77:29 - 77:34)
requirement is that they just have a (77:32 - 77:37)
base stat total of 600 and yeah but I (77:34 - 77:41)
think pseudo legendary again is saying (77:37 - 77:45)
the same thing it has a powerful end (77:41 - 77:47)
stat that is the that is the thing that (77:45 - 77:50)
is making it a pseudo legendary that the (77:47 - 77:54)
end stats are powerful because it is on (77:50 - 77:57)
par with a legendary so when we (77:54 - 78:00)
are putting things into pseudo legendary (77:57 - 78:03)
we are saying they have the same power (78:00 - 78:06)
AKA stats as a legendary and I don't (78:03 - 78:09)
know that that the other requirements (78:06 - 78:12)
going into pseudo legendary Trump the (78:09 - 78:14)
fact that we are saying they have good (78:12 - 78:16)
stats they don't necessarily it's just (78:14 - 78:19)
patterns that haven't been broken until (78:16 - 78:22)
now but I always thought I would I'm (78:19 - 78:24)
still saying that like the definition (78:22 - 78:26)
what people are mostly saying pseudo (78:24 - 78:29)
legendary 4 is because of the end based (78:26 - 78:33)
St total that that category exists as a (78:29 - 78:36)
a way to label powerful Pokemon on the (78:33 - 78:38)
power level of a (78:36 - 78:40)
legendary that (78:38 - 78:44)
aren't legendary and that is stat-based (78:40 - 78:47)
it's all stat based none of the other (78:44 - 78:49)
things matter other than they've been a (78:47 - 78:52)
pattern up until this point so when (78:49 - 78:55)
you're getting down into this what does (78:52 - 78:56)
the staple remover (78:55 - 78:59)
fit again the thing that you're (78:56 - 79:02)
categorizing is its powerful base (78:59 - 79:05)
stats you were lumping things in based (79:02 - 79:08)
off of common traits but you're not (79:05 - 79:10)
going to like we don't say well because (79:08 - 79:12)
it has three Evolutions Venusaur is a (79:10 - 79:15)
pseudo legendary like the evolution (79:12 - 79:18)
chunks were broken by a million examples (79:15 - 79:20)
the one thing that is consistent and the (79:18 - 79:22)
one thing that you're labeling for are (79:20 - 79:25)
the that's at the (79:22 - 79:25)
end I I never liked the term pseudo (79:26 - 79:37)
legendary um and I think it's just (79:32 - 79:37)
like I I feel like it makes Pokemon (79:38 - 79:46)
like this is going to upset a lot of (79:43 - 79:50)
people it makes like Dragonite or or or (79:46 - 79:53)
dragapult or all these Pokemon like more (79:50 - 79:56)
special than they (79:53 - 79:58)
are like oh they're they're they're (79:56 - 80:00)
almost legendary but they're not they're (79:58 - 80:02)
like very common they're very easy to (80:00 - 80:05)
get you can like breed them (80:02 - 80:08)
like like I feel like when I was a child (80:05 - 80:10)
yes Dragonite was incredibly hard to get (80:08 - 80:12)
because you could only get Dratini from (80:10 - 80:15)
like the the auction the gambling Center (80:12 - 80:17)
or you had to like go in Safari Zone and (80:15 - 80:19)
you had a fish and it felt like it was (80:17 - 80:21)
like this impossible legendary Pokemon (80:19 - 80:25)
to get you want a you want a Dratini I (80:21 - 80:27)
can get you a Dratini in 45 seconds (80:25 - 80:29)
right now like there's so many ways to (80:27 - 80:32)
get a Dratini or to get a duraladon or (80:29 - 80:36)
to get uh a dpy um like I'm pretty sure (80:32 - 80:38)
the first week of sword and shield there (80:36 - 80:41)
were more dpes in the universe than any (80:38 - 80:43)
other Pokemon out there because (80:41 - 80:46)
literally everyone was breeding dpy so (80:43 - 80:49)
when you're like oh this is like like a (80:46 - 80:52)
so close to a legendary it's like is it (80:49 - 80:54)
when like my grandma is breeding for a (80:52 - 80:57)
re like it never like the the term just (80:54 - 81:00)
felt very disconnected of like it did it (80:57 - 81:03)
does feel very dated of like in older (81:00 - 81:05)
Pokemon games yes these Pokemon were (81:03 - 81:08)
harder like the concept of a Dratini or (81:05 - 81:11)
a Larvitar were much harder to find than (81:08 - 81:12)
other Pokemon but (81:11 - 81:15)
nowadays they're just powerful but (81:12 - 81:17)
they're not they're also they are still (81:15 - 81:20)
harder to get the first time like you (81:17 - 81:21)
can trade them from someone sure but you (81:20 - 81:24)
can get any Pokemon from a trade mhm (81:21 - 81:26)
when you come across these Pokemon in (81:24 - 81:30)
game in the story they are still later (81:26 - 81:32)
in the (81:30 - 81:34)
game they are still harder Pokemon to (81:32 - 81:38)
get to merro is also like after you beat (81:34 - 81:40)
eight Pokemon in gold and silver and (81:38 - 81:41)
then it's like ah you can finally catch (81:40 - 81:43)
a merro and Kanto or like a hound hour (81:41 - 81:46)
cuz those games are terrible with like (81:43 - 81:48)
putting all the Johto Pokemon in the (81:46 - 81:50)
Kanto region after you've done with (81:48 - 81:54)
jotto so it's like yeah yes I totally (81:50 - 81:55)
get your point where like they they are (81:54 - 81:58)
later in the game I mean like you could (81:55 - 82:01)
you could also tack on the fact that (81:58 - 82:04)
these Pokemon are much harder to evolve (82:01 - 82:06)
than other Pokemon but no one talks (82:04 - 82:09)
about that but I would say that that's (82:06 - 82:12)
usually a common thing with at least (82:09 - 82:15)
like dpy to dragapult is a nightmare (82:12 - 82:16)
through your playthrough like if you try (82:15 - 82:18)
to run through that game with either Dy (82:16 - 82:21)
or dragonall or draak like they're so (82:18 - 82:25)
garbage compared to to um dragapult like (82:21 - 82:27)
just through a general playthrough (82:25 - 82:28)
because they don't learn a lot of moves (82:27 - 82:29)
and they're not nearly as strong and (82:28 - 82:31)
they they take way more (82:29 - 82:33)
experience same thing with like (82:31 - 82:36)
Tyranitar and Pupitar before you get or (82:33 - 82:39)
Larvitar to Pupitar before you get to (82:36 - 82:42)
Tyranitar um but that doesn't like apply (82:39 - 82:46)
to like all those Pokemon like badon is (82:42 - 82:48)
still pretty like good and bulky and (82:46 - 82:51)
like can hold its own and like matang is (82:48 - 82:53)
also like pretty decent before before he (82:51 - 82:55)
gets to metag so like even that case of (82:53 - 82:58)
like these Pokemon are kind of bad (82:55 - 82:59)
before they get to like their final (82:58 - 83:01)
stage like that that's still hit and (82:59 - 83:04)
miss and then the experience thing I'd (83:01 - 83:06)
have to look at the experience thing but (83:04 - 83:09)
I they they all I think have a pretty (83:06 - 83:11)
heavy they all have a slow rate (83:09 - 83:15)
currently they all have a slow rate (83:11 - 83:18)
Evolution duraladon you just use an item (83:15 - 83:20)
yeah (83:18 - 83:23)
yep but then is there this weird recc (83:20 - 83:24)
well like again it's just fanmade term (83:23 - 83:26)
so it doesn't really matter but like (83:24 - 83:29)
what if duraladon gets a (83:26 - 83:31)
pre-evolution then all of a sudden it (83:29 - 83:36)
fits then will that meet your me then (83:31 - 83:38)
then it would be them going okay you've (83:36 - 83:41)
had all these discussions no matter what (83:38 - 83:43)
you landed on we're g to throw it all up (83:41 - 83:46)
in the air (83:43 - 83:46)
again I just I I do think it's I do (83:50 - 83:56)
think it's cool though the and (83:53 - 84:00)
that because of a single Pokemon because (83:56 - 84:02)
of arch aladon being (84:00 - 84:05)
introduced we are now talking about the (84:02 - 84:06)
600 (84:05 - 84:09)
club which has existed for a long time (84:06 - 84:12)
but it was like that was like because of (84:09 - 84:15)
this Pokemon now now we have seen like (84:12 - 84:18)
the uh the English speaking side who (84:15 - 84:20)
who's always used pseudo legendaries and (84:18 - 84:23)
the Japanese side who's always used 600 (84:20 - 84:26)
club and now that's like clashing over (84:23 - 84:29)
archidon which I I which I think is just (84:26 - 84:35)
very funny yeah it's it's wild but again (84:29 - 84:35)
like when we are choosing to put labels (84:38 - 84:45)
on things we need to be clear about why (84:41 - 84:47)
we are choosing to put a label on a (84:45 - 84:50)
thing and what that is actually doing (84:47 - 84:54)
for us this is the same conversation we (84:50 - 84:56)
end up having around like is it quote (84:54 - 84:58)
unquote legitimate and what does (84:56 - 85:00)
legitimate mean and legitimate means (84:58 - 85:03)
different things to different people uh (85:00 - 85:06)
like when we are going to name and label (85:03 - 85:10)
something we need to be more clear about (85:06 - 85:13)
what that label is serving for us why is (85:10 - 85:16)
that label a good label why is that (85:13 - 85:18)
label important and like to that end I (85:16 - 85:20)
would say the pseudo legendary label is (85:18 - 85:23)
a bad label um it's not clear whereas (85:20 - 85:27)
the 600 label 600 Club label is a good (85:23 - 85:29)
label it is very clear as to what it's (85:27 - 85:33)
talking about and why that is a (85:29 - 85:36)
thing uh fun fact about the pseudo (85:33 - 85:38)
legendaries is a lot of them got Mega (85:36 - 85:41)
Evolutions except for poor Dragonite (85:38 - 85:44)
except for Dragonite get ready Tyranitar (85:41 - 85:46)
salamance Metagross Garchomp all got (85:44 - 85:48)
Mega which brought their base stat total (85:46 - 85:50)
from 600 to (85:48 - 85:54)
700 um (85:50 - 85:54)
and so they Mega Evolution was Gen 6 got (85:55 - 86:01)
to think about that so they missed they (85:59 - 86:05)
missed Dragonite Hy dragon and Goodra (86:01 - 86:07)
they could have all technically (86:05 - 86:10)
qualified (86:07 - 86:10)
um I always forget kima's thing there (86:11 - 86:16)
was an official piece of (86:13 - 86:20)
artwork um from the Pokemon company that (86:16 - 86:23)
featured Dragonite and Dratini Metagross (86:20 - 86:28)
Beldum gomi Goodra uh pretty much all (86:23 - 86:29)
the standard ones that you would say (86:28 - 86:31)
pseudo legendary uh and they called it (86:29 - 86:34)
the Late Bloomer (86:31 - 86:37)
collection which I think is very fun uh (86:34 - 86:40)
it was that's good one the late bloomers (86:37 - 86:43)
were official Pokemon merch so they are (86:40 - 86:45)
they are acknowledged like like the (86:43 - 86:46)
Pokemon company does acknowledge that (86:45 - 86:49)
these are powerful Pokemon that (86:46 - 86:53)
like they they are in the games right (86:49 - 86:57)
um yeah I mean I think from like uh as (86:53 - 87:00)
they are designing things like as a (86:57 - 87:03)
design concept that is actually probably (87:00 - 87:06)
something that they do talk about like (87:03 - 87:10)
what is going to be our three stage (87:06 - 87:11)
power what is going to be our Late (87:10 - 87:13)
Bloomer yeah what's going to be our Late (87:11 - 87:15)
Bloomer and I think why are we calling (87:13 - 87:17)
it late bloomers that's sounds way (87:15 - 87:19)
better than that's way that's much (87:17 - 87:21)
better I I do think like if we want to (87:19 - 87:24)
talk about the design and like when you (87:21 - 87:25)
start talking about like what's our (87:24 - 87:27)
route one (87:25 - 87:30)
rat what's our route one bird what's our (87:27 - 87:33)
route to bug you know what's our Pikachu (87:30 - 87:37)
clone like those are those are good (87:33 - 87:39)
categories in the fact that you can (87:37 - 87:42)
point out examples of that design (87:39 - 87:44)
principle but again that is based the (87:42 - 87:46)
one thing we're categorizing there is (87:44 - 87:50)
the design like this fits into this (87:46 - 87:52)
design category so I think pseudo (87:50 - 87:55)
legendary does fit as far as there is (87:52 - 87:57)
one of them (87:55 - 88:01)
in uh most games although hoen has (87:57 - 88:05)
two yeah yeah yeah that pattern's broken (88:01 - 88:06)
yeah see that's interesting too because (88:05 - 88:07)
you're like oh there's a there's a (88:06 - 88:09)
pseudo legendary one in every game and (88:07 - 88:11)
it's like but hoen has two of them for (88:09 - 88:13)
what whatever (88:11 - 88:16)
reason uh but I do think (88:13 - 88:19)
like again pseudo legendary light (88:16 - 88:21)
Bloomer fits that better it's a three (88:19 - 88:23)
stage that evolves very late (88:21 - 88:26)
Late Bloomer from a design perspective (88:23 - 88:29)
but again pseudo legendary from design (88:26 - 88:31)
also includes the fact that it's a late (88:29 - 88:36)
bloomer and has a higher stat total (88:31 - 88:40)
again does that work (88:36 - 88:44)
for the steel the staple remover no uh (88:40 - 88:47)
because that's not its design right like (88:44 - 88:49)
that wasn't a design feature for that it (88:47 - 88:52)
wasn't designed to be a late bloomer is (88:49 - 88:55)
designed to be a trade Evolution so (88:52 - 88:57)
pseudo (88:55 - 88:59)
legendary for I mean for an item (88:57 - 89:01)
Evolution being reserved for a late (88:59 - 89:03)
bloomer makes sense therefore staple (89:01 - 89:06)
remover is not in (89:03 - 89:09)
there so according to Bubble pedia our (89:06 - 89:11)
chadon does not fall under audo (89:09 - 89:14)
legendary for America but it does the (89:11 - 89:16)
the Japanese players have warmly (89:14 - 89:19)
accepted it into the 600 Club so if you (89:16 - 89:23)
if you go to the uh Japanese (89:19 - 89:27)
version of Bulbapedia which is a wik a (89:23 - 89:30)
Wiki Plage I cannot read (89:27 - 89:35)
uh that our our chadon is is part of (89:30 - 89:38)
that um and it is they're saying it's (89:35 - 89:40)
the only Pokemon with a base that total (89:38 - 89:41)
that is not a pseudo legendary not a (89:40 - 89:43)
legendary not a mythical or not a Mega (89:41 - 89:44)
Evolution that would be part of the 600 (89:43 - 89:47)
Club in (89:44 - 89:48)
Japan (89:47 - 89:51)
but I think I think part of the point (89:48 - 89:54)
here is like as more more Pokemon are (89:51 - 89:57)
introduced the lines of what well I (89:54 - 89:58)
think what I think Greg said it (89:57 - 90:00)
perfectly the lines of what if people (89:58 - 90:02)
are defining these are get get looser (90:00 - 90:04)
and (90:02 - 90:08)
looser and start to fall (90:04 - 90:08)
apart which is like fine they're just I (90:08 - 90:12)
don't think that's a bad thing I think (90:11 - 90:15)
if we are going to use these (90:12 - 90:18)
terms and we want to capture a certain (90:15 - 90:21)
thing I think if if this is going to (90:18 - 90:22)
become a thing that we're going to argue (90:21 - 90:24)
about I think we need to be very clear (90:22 - 90:27)
how we are defining them and what that (90:24 - 90:30)
definition provides us okay here's the (90:27 - 90:32)
actual definition from bedia so you have (90:30 - 90:35)
a Pokemon that is a final stage three (90:32 - 90:37)
evolution you have a Pokemon with a base (90:35 - 90:40)
out total of 600 before no mega (90:37 - 90:42)
evolution so I guess when you say (90:40 - 90:44)
three-stage Evolution that knocks out (90:42 - 90:46)
Latios Latias Deoxys dark cry because (90:44 - 90:49)
they don't evolve and then a Pokemon has (90:46 - 90:52)
to level up at a slow rate required ing (90:49 - 90:54)
a total of (90:52 - 90:57)
1,250,000 experience points to reach (90:54 - 91:00)
level 100 so that would be the slowest (90:57 - 91:03)
rate so the the crazy thing is like what (91:00 - 91:06)
if gen 10 comes out and there's a a (91:03 - 91:08)
three-stage Evolution based that total (91:06 - 91:11)
of 600 but it doesn't have a slow rate (91:08 - 91:14)
then all of a (91:11 - 91:14)
sudden that that changes yeah I mean I (91:14 - 91:18)
think I guess it wouldn't qualify I (91:16 - 91:20)
think if what we are trying to say with (91:18 - 91:22)
pseudo legendary also is expected to be (91:20 - 91:24)
hard to evolve it it it evolves at a (91:22 - 91:26)
very late rate and very slowly if that (91:24 - 91:28)
is a useful category then I think pseudo (91:26 - 91:32)
legendary remains a useful category if (91:28 - 91:34)
we are considering both of those things (91:32 - 91:37)
like it has to have a high stat total (91:34 - 91:42)
and it has to have a slow rate of (91:37 - 91:46)
evolving and it has to evolve so if (91:42 - 91:48)
those are the again if those are the (91:46 - 91:49)
three things that we're using to Define (91:48 - 91:53)
Su legendary cool I I still question (91:49 - 91:55)
what is that getting us what is that (91:53 - 91:58)
telling us other than a (91:55 - 92:01)
design feature about poor (91:58 - 92:05)
haxus what about poror haxus three-stage (92:01 - 92:11)
Evolution slow slow evolve 1.25 mil only (92:05 - 92:13)
based that total of (92:11 - 92:17)
540 w w i I really did think as a as a (92:13 - 92:19)
well I wasn't a kid when black and white (92:17 - 92:20)
came (92:19 - 92:22)
out I was like 19 20 when black and (92:20 - 92:24)
white came out I definitely thought (92:22 - 92:26)
haxus would have like without even like (92:24 - 92:28)
looking at it I was just like oh like (92:26 - 92:29)
black and white has two pseudo (92:28 - 92:31)
legendaries it has haxus and has (92:29 - 92:34)
hydragon it seemed obvious yeah but but (92:31 - 92:37)
yeah no haxus only has 540 based that (92:34 - 92:40)
total um but it fits the other ones it's (92:37 - 92:42)
it's it's I don't know I thought it was (92:40 - 92:44)
a fun topic (92:42 - 92:48)
for uh for today's episode okay so now (92:44 - 92:50)
with the 600 Club being talked about (92:48 - 92:55)
what is our favorite 600 Club (92:50 - 92:55)
Pokemon I know gr what do you think mine (92:56 - 93:03)
is just take a guess okay Gregs is back (92:58 - 93:05)
Calibur (93:03 - 93:08)
1,000% before back Calibur though what (93:05 - 93:10)
did you have a preference yeah do you (93:08 - 93:13)
know what it (93:10 - 93:13)
is you don't seem like a Metagross kind (93:13 - 93:17)
of (93:15 - 93:19)
guy you don't seem like a salamance kind (93:17 - 93:20)
of guy either even though you're a big (93:19 - 93:22)
gen 3 Fan (93:20 - 93:25)
incorrect you're a salamance guy yeah (93:22 - 93:30)
you love you love the mens yeah so if if (93:25 - 93:32)
I'm to order (93:30 - 93:35)
them backx Calibur salamance Como those (93:32 - 93:38)
are my Top O KO is (93:35 - 93:41)
good um and then I would go (93:38 - 93:44)
Garchomp (93:41 - 93:46)
Metagross (93:44 - 93:51)
hydron dragapult Tyranitar Dragonite (93:46 - 93:53)
Goodra I don't like Goodra at (93:51 - 93:57)
all cuz he's I'm not a Goodra fan too (93:53 - 93:59)
slim interesting it's too slimy it falls (93:57 - 94:01)
into the same the Slime falls into the (93:59 - 94:05)
same problem that Cub chw snot bubble (94:01 - 94:08)
has I have to look at it I never want to (94:05 - 94:11)
see it animated it's just gross and (94:08 - 94:13)
every time I look at it that's what I (94:11 - 94:17)
focus on and then be tick has frozen (94:13 - 94:20)
snot beard and as a kid growing up (94:17 - 94:23)
skiing with my dad who would go into (94:20 - 94:25)
Lodge and there his mustache would be (94:23 - 94:29)
Frozen with snot that is just a visual (94:25 - 94:33)
that is traumatizing and I don't like (94:29 - 94:37)
it Hannah can you order them for us oh (94:33 - 94:42)
gosh putting them actually in an order (94:37 - 94:46)
um I will say that ever since I started (94:42 - 94:49)
streaming and made an emote of Jang moo (94:46 - 94:52)
homoo has very quickly become where's my (94:49 - 94:53)
my camera there's my camera I have a pin (94:52 - 94:54)
it's (94:53 - 94:58)
beautiful so good very quickly just (94:54 - 95:00)
rocketed to the top of my favorite I did (94:58 - 95:02)
five hours looking into its design the (95:00 - 95:04)
other day uh so that I understood as (95:02 - 95:06)
much as possible about that Pokemon did (95:04 - 95:08)
you know jangma oh is the very first (95:06 - 95:11)
Pokemon designed for alola fun fact whoa (95:08 - 95:13)
I didn't know (95:11 - 95:18)
that but putting them in order I don't (95:13 - 95:22)
think I can do as quickly as Greg did (95:18 - 95:24)
can you do a top (95:22 - 95:29)
three I am indecisive top three (95:24 - 95:31)
maybe uh (95:29 - 95:33)
Kumo (95:31 - 95:35)
salamance and maybe (95:33 - 95:37)
dragapult I (95:35 - 95:40)
think I like the cool ones they're all (95:37 - 95:43)
cool but but those ones are especially (95:40 - 95:47)
cool on the show how artox is like the (95:43 - 95:49)
most Pokemon Pokemon (95:47 - 95:52)
ever does that make sense no (95:49 - 95:56)
I think so what what do you mean by (95:52 - 95:59)
that it reminds me of the silhouette of (95:56 - 96:02)
just a basic Pokemon from gen one all of (95:59 - 96:04)
the the little (96:02 - 96:07)
icons like like I feel you know how like (96:04 - 96:10)
Pokemon feel like a certain (96:07 - 96:12)
generation like like dragapult (96:10 - 96:16)
definitely feels like a gen 8 Pokemon (96:12 - 96:19)
and like Goodra definitely feels like a (96:16 - 96:23)
gen six Pokemon when I look at aracs I (96:19 - 96:26)
feel like it it feels like a gen one (96:23 - 96:28)
Pokemon but also like a gen two like it (96:26 - 96:31)
feels like it fits into almost every (96:28 - 96:33)
generation just (96:31 - 96:37)
fine and it's crazy that like I don't (96:33 - 96:40)
think fridy backs or back scalibur have (96:37 - 96:44)
that effect no but just ARS arack just (96:40 - 96:46)
feels like you could plop it in any (96:44 - 96:48)
generation and you like a lot of people (96:46 - 96:50)
think Skarmory is Gen 3 and I like (96:48 - 96:53)
totally understand why people that I I (96:50 - 96:55)
totally get it but like Skarmory is a (96:53 - 96:57)
Gen 2 Pokemon um and I think people (96:55 - 97:01)
think that of Slugma and me cargo I (96:57 - 97:02)
think they think that those are gen 3 (97:01 - 97:04)
Pokemon and again I totally see why (97:02 - 97:07)
people think that it's just aracs just (97:04 - 97:09)
feels like you could plop it anywhere (97:07 - 97:11)
and be like yeah that makes sense it (97:09 - 97:12)
fits (97:11 - 97:14)
there it I don't know I like I really (97:12 - 97:16)
like (97:14 - 97:18)
aracs the whole Line's (97:16 - 97:20)
great uh I think my number one would (97:18 - 97:23)
easily be drag Al uh and then my number (97:20 - 97:24)
two would be (97:23 - 97:26)
hydragon or (97:24 - 97:30)
hydragon uh gosh number three I think I (97:26 - 97:33)
would do Goodra I do like (97:30 - 97:35)
Goodra it's very obvious on the show (97:33 - 97:38)
that Greg and I have very opposite (97:35 - 97:42)
tastes I have good taste and you (97:38 - 97:42)
don't salamance is like one of those (97:43 - 97:47)
Pokemon where I liked it way more until (97:45 - 97:50)
I started using it competitively and uh (97:47 - 97:52)
salaman are just really hard to use (97:50 - 97:55)
competitively it's it's just very it's (97:52 - 97:56)
very only top trainers know how to use (97:55 - 97:59)
it properly that's true that's true (97:56 - 98:02)
um it's hard that that's like a harder (97:59 - 98:05)
thing to explain of like these Pokemon (98:02 - 98:07)
are easier to use versus these Pokemon (98:05 - 98:09)
are harder to use because it's it's not (98:07 - 98:12)
it's not only just move sets it's it's (98:09 - 98:13)
it's like the utility of it like I (98:12 - 98:15)
really do think like (98:13 - 98:17)
incinerar is like an easier Pokemon to (98:15 - 98:20)
use because it does things where if you (98:17 - 98:22)
mess up it's like still is doing (98:20 - 98:23)
something that's like useful on top of (98:22 - 98:26)
like being dark and fire just is really (98:23 - 98:29)
really good typing wise um more (98:26 - 98:31)
salamance is like a little bit harder to (98:29 - 98:35)
navigate um even though they both have (98:31 - 98:35)
intimidate uh I like Dragon Pa a whole (98:35 - 98:41)
lot so here's a question for you all (98:38 - 98:44)
when do you think these we have most of (98:41 - 98:46)
the quote unquote pseudo legendaries in (98:44 - 98:49)
unite right now Dragonite in Tyranitar (98:46 - 98:51)
is in salaman is in Metagross is is now (98:49 - 98:55)
in garch is in bad (98:51 - 98:58)
right no Garo got a buff uh although (98:55 - 99:00)
medicross came in bad and then got a (98:58 - 99:02)
super buff and now everybody's mad about (99:00 - 99:04)
it because it's it's Wrecking house for (99:02 - 99:08)
no good reason so the there are only (99:04 - 99:11)
three on this suit of (99:08 - 99:16)
Legendary list left Kom backx caliber (99:11 - 99:17)
and (99:16 - 99:20)
hydreon of those which do you think will (99:17 - 99:22)
be the first to go (99:20 - 99:24)
into (99:22 - 99:27)
unite backx caliber probably last (99:24 - 99:30)
caliber I feel like if (99:27 - 99:35)
if if gen five is the next remake which (99:30 - 99:36)
would make sense because they already (99:35 - 99:38)
did one two three 4 like that's not like (99:36 - 99:40)
me like that's like me not like trying (99:38 - 99:42)
to like speculate it's like they're just (99:40 - 99:43)
going in order yeah they're going in (99:42 - 99:45)
order I feel like they would they would (99:43 - 99:48)
definitely hold that until closer to (99:45 - 99:51)
that since they do like two every now (99:48 - 99:53)
and then line stuff up yeah um so I feel (99:51 - 99:57)
like a while yeah not all the time but (99:53 - 100:00)
if they can they do um but here's a (99:57 - 100:01)
question for you (100:00 - 100:05)
Greg do they let duraladon evolve and (100:01 - 100:07)
unite (100:05 - 100:10)
eventually (100:07 - 100:13)
so this is the this is (100:10 - 100:15)
a problem (100:13 - 100:17)
because (100:15 - 100:21)
like some of them do Mega Evolve but Lar (100:17 - 100:25)
iio doesn't right like we have mega (100:21 - 100:27)
evolution in there now but they haven't (100:25 - 100:29)
gone back and changed the ones that can (100:27 - 100:31)
mega evolve to be able to Mega Evolve (100:29 - 100:34)
wait who mega evolves Mewtwo oh yeah (100:31 - 100:38)
yeah yeah but Charizard (100:34 - 100:42)
so do they (100:38 - 100:44)
release and (100:42 - 100:47)
ultimately change that entire line uh (100:44 - 100:50)
and try to rebalance it to allow that to (100:47 - 100:54)
get a Mega Evolution switch over or uh (100:50 - 100:57)
uh Evolution and then go back and redo (100:54 - 101:02)
everybody or do they introduce that line (100:57 - 101:05)
again like they did with Eevee to say (101:02 - 101:08)
that its end form is different because (101:05 - 101:11)
they've done it all at this point um I (101:08 - 101:13)
think in all honesty that they would (101:11 - 101:16)
probably have (101:13 - 101:17)
two Dal (101:16 - 101:20)
alidons one that does evolve and one (101:17 - 101:22)
that doesn't that have two different (101:20 - 101:24)
roles like okay so there's two mewt (101:22 - 101:28)
right now y but there's only one (101:24 - 101:30)
Scizor well sorry one Scyther and (101:28 - 101:33)
there's only one Cub Fu but they can (101:30 - 101:35)
split they can split so do you think (101:33 - 101:37)
they would split it where you could (101:35 - 101:40)
evolve it into Arch I think they would (101:37 - 101:42)
have to then they would still have to (101:40 - 101:44)
redesign from the ground up because they (101:42 - 101:48)
would have to decide what moves allow it (101:44 - 101:52)
to evolve because that's the thing with (101:48 - 101:54)
uh Scyther and that's the thing with (101:52 - 101:57)
kubfu the moves you pick determine (101:54 - 101:58)
whether it evolves or not because (101:57 - 101:59)
Scyther can just stay I see what you're (101:58 - 102:01)
saying I see what you're saying so again (101:59 - 102:04)
they would have to redesign duraladon so (102:01 - 102:06)
that two of its move would force its (102:04 - 102:08)
Evolution and two of it don't and at (102:06 - 102:10)
that point I think they would just make (102:08 - 102:13)
a new one and give it a different role (102:10 - 102:16)
you tell me duron's in a bad spot right (102:13 - 102:18)
now where they use that as a reason to (102:16 - 102:22)
just fix it dralon is always in a bad (102:18 - 102:25)
spot there you go it is always a tough (102:22 - 102:29)
spot so I mean they could decide that's (102:25 - 102:30)
how they're fixing it is to pull it and (102:29 - 102:33)
put it back in but I think again there's (102:30 - 102:35)
people who are very used to that that (102:33 - 102:38)
play style and remaining that way that (102:35 - 102:40)
would be very frustrated with it (102:38 - 102:42)
suddenly becoming something different so (102:40 - 102:44)
I have a I I lean much more as they (102:42 - 102:46)
would introduce something new so that (102:44 - 102:48)
people who were used to playing that old (102:46 - 102:51)
style would still have that one and (102:48 - 102:54)
people people playing the new one would (102:51 - 102:57)
have a new play style to get used to and (102:54 - 102:59)
it would evolve I think generally how (102:57 - 103:02)
they're running unite again this was (102:59 - 103:05)
this is also before Magikarp comes in (103:02 - 103:08)
and they have thrown off all design (103:05 - 103:11)
principles when they made Magikarp so (103:08 - 103:13)
all bets are off I don't know what (103:11 - 103:15)
they're thinking anymore because (103:13 - 103:18)
Magikarp is so (103:15 - 103:22)
weird that they at this can do anything (103:18 - 103:24)
and it's very exciting but Magikarp is I (103:22 - 103:28)
I I don't know what to think it's (103:24 - 103:30)
weird I'm asking the wrong group of (103:28 - 103:31)
people but I'm assuming League of (103:30 - 103:34)
Legends have really weird legends that (103:31 - 103:36)
do things that aren't the norm there's (103:34 - 103:40)
like 900 of them so yeah (103:36 - 103:42)
yeah I don't know if you know this Greg (103:40 - 103:44)
but there's over a thousand Pokemon now (103:42 - 103:47)
I know they got they got they got plenty (103:44 - 103:49)
of road to (103:47 - 103:52)
pave I mean I met I don't honestly I (103:49 - 103:54)
don't know about League of Legends so I (103:52 - 103:55)
don't know that they have the same sort (103:54 - 103:59)
of weird Evolution path (103:55 - 104:02)
um I don't know if Champions have like (103:59 - 104:04)
they change into something different I (104:02 - 104:06)
know they have a leveling path but I (104:04 - 104:08)
don't know if you're like and stuff they (104:06 - 104:10)
become something different which is (104:08 - 104:11)
unique (104:10 - 104:12)
[Music] (104:11 - 104:14)
to unite I think that's one of the (104:12 - 104:17)
things that does change it out um I (104:14 - 104:18)
think it's also one of the things that (104:17 - 104:22)
makes it harder to balance (104:18 - 104:26)
um but I don't know (104:22 - 104:28)
um they're all quiet about what's coming (104:26 - 104:31)
next anyways after magp like map we've (104:28 - 104:34)
been saying new map for like yeah they (104:31 - 104:35)
have been super Qui everybody says (104:34 - 104:38)
there's a new map we have missed the m i (104:35 - 104:39)
feel (104:38 - 104:41)
like you know when people are like ah (104:39 - 104:43)
they're GNA come out with like gen five (104:41 - 104:45)
or yeah if you keep saying it it'll (104:43 - 104:47)
eventually be true if I keep saying new (104:45 - 104:51)
map I could be like new map they did it (104:47 - 104:52)
do expect since they haven't announced (104:51 - 104:54)
the actual release for Magikarp I think (104:52 - 104:59)
Magikarp is released on Pokemon (104:54 - 105:03)
day and I think it will be (104:59 - 105:06)
free oh yeah I'm sure because it's it's (105:03 - 105:10)
wild and but Pokemon day is like a month (105:06 - 105:11)
away don't (105:10 - 105:13)
they they should be one Pokemon in (105:11 - 105:16)
between (105:13 - 105:16)
right they got severely burned on the (105:19 - 105:28)
Mewtwo thing like really severely burned (105:23 - 105:30)
and now they they've switched design (105:28 - 105:34)
philosophies to say release it week and (105:30 - 105:37)
fix it after because both mcara and (105:34 - 105:41)
Metagross were terrible at release and (105:37 - 105:42)
now are (105:41 - 105:45)
tuned overpowered (105:42 - 105:47)
so that just feels like they're going to (105:45 - 105:50)
have to adjust them at least twice with (105:47 - 105:51)
every new Pokemon now (105:50 - 105:54)
they they they are I don't like I (105:51 - 105:56)
actually I feel like you should release (105:54 - 105:58)
it powerful so you feel like your money (105:56 - 106:01)
is well spent (105:58 - 106:05)
they and then Nerf it and then be upset (106:01 - 106:06)
the the the the problem that we're (106:05 - 106:10)
facing is we are in a post Mewtwo world (106:06 - 106:12)
and everybody the world I want to live (106:10 - 106:16)
in Greg post Mewtwo so everybody expects (106:12 - 106:18)
everything to come in at Mewtwo power (106:16 - 106:21)
level which was flat out broken so when (106:18 - 106:23)
they don't they (106:21 - 106:26)
feel really bad like it feels bad to (106:23 - 106:27)
play them at first and then they (106:26 - 106:30)
suddenly they'll crank them up so they (106:27 - 106:32)
feel really good so I don't I don't know (106:30 - 106:34)
what the right path is like we they (106:32 - 106:36)
can't undo the damage they did with (106:34 - 106:39)
Mewtwo like it they did severe damage to (106:36 - 106:42)
everybody's trusts with that one um and (106:39 - 106:47)
the new season will start with them not (106:42 - 106:48)
allowing (106:47 - 106:51)
EX in master rank anymore more like that (106:48 - 106:54)
is on the horizon so I don't think they (106:51 - 106:56)
want to release something in between (106:54 - 106:59)
there because so many foundational (106:56 - 107:01)
things that are changing how unite will (106:59 - 107:05)
work with the new season are happening a (107:01 - 107:08)
month before Pokemon (107:05 - 107:11)
day so I I I do think they are a little (107:08 - 107:14)
afraid I think they've stepped back a (107:11 - 107:15)
bit to be like (107:14 - 107:19)
whoa that went bad um again the The Meta (107:15 - 107:21)
has changed so that everybody feels feel (107:19 - 107:22)
like you have to have a Metagross on (107:21 - 107:24)
your table because they cranked it up (107:22 - 107:27)
real high um which they honestly they (107:24 - 107:29)
had to move is still here's the real (107:27 - 107:32)
unite news they I thought this was a (107:29 - 107:37)
joke at first but probably they but they (107:32 - 107:39)
have now anytime a new Pokemon has been (107:37 - 107:42)
introduced it is always destroying a (107:39 - 107:46)
karant every single trailer they're like (107:42 - 107:49)
Metagross watch it kill this crar an (107:46 - 107:52)
mascara like they they like kind of did (107:49 - 107:53)
it at the beginning where it was like (107:52 - 107:55)
sometimes it was crar an sometimes it (107:53 - 107:59)
was like whatever but now it is always (107:55 - 108:02)
crar well that's because crar was a (107:59 - 108:05)
problem for so long and so many people (108:02 - 108:06)
hated that Pokemon that they're like (108:05 - 108:09)
watch it kill it watch it put that thing (108:06 - 108:11)
in the dust when they introduce Magik (108:09 - 108:13)
carbon Gyarados if it's destroying a CR (108:11 - 108:15)
it just further proves my like I have to (108:13 - 108:17)
go back but I'm almost positive it's (108:15 - 108:20)
always crar they're destroying which is (108:17 - 108:22)
pretty good I'm I'm I'm all for more (108:20 - 108:24)
crar screen time (108:22 - 108:27)
really my poor burd (108:24 - 108:29)
uh I they need to figure out what (108:27 - 108:32)
they're doing with that one it was (108:29 - 108:34)
so bad I heard he's good right now (108:32 - 108:36)
though it is it is back to being good (108:34 - 108:39)
again they buffed it again so back crime (108:36 - 108:41)
rant back to being good you're not like (108:39 - 108:43)
oh why is that on my (108:41 - 108:45)
team are people still pairing it with (108:43 - 108:46)
the (108:45 - 108:51)
Lapras mhm although Lapras Has Fallen (108:46 - 108:55)
some uh it got a big Nerf um so people (108:51 - 108:57)
aren't using it as much (108:55 - 109:00)
anymore um all right well the last patch (108:57 - 109:03)
was rough on on on a bunch of Staples (109:00 - 109:06)

love Tyranitar cuz my first game was (109:19 - 109:23)
Johto I don't know but that's probably (109:21 - 109:24)
why you love tanur honestly I'm going to (109:23 - 109:26)
go on a whim and say that your first (109:24 - 109:27)
game was probably Johto that's why you (109:26 - 109:29)
like (109:27 - 109:32)
tan I will say this though to be fair (109:29 - 109:34)
when they showed Metagross unite move it (109:32 - 109:39)
destroyed karant Greninja and Lucario so (109:34 - 109:42)
karat wasn't alone okay all right he was (109:39 - 109:44)
there though he was there he was there (109:42 - 109:46)
they did use crem rant though for its (109:44 - 109:48)
other moves where it's just sitting in a (109:46 - 109:51)
circle beating on that bird (109:48 - 109:54)
yeah I'm very into that (109:51 - 109:54)

like really stare by it stare at it side (110:17 - 110:21)
by side to do that lower expectations (110:19 - 110:23)

Bobby on near the end of the month early (111:35 - 111:40)
February because we're getting a big TCG (111:38 - 111:43)
set and no shade to Hannah and Greg but (111:40 - 111:46)
I already talk a lot on this podcast and (111:43 - 111:49)

really talking more than I want to so on (111:49 - 111:55)
your own bud so Bobby's very into the (111:53 - 111:58)
TCG spends way more money on me so I (111:55 - 112:00)
think that's kind of one of (111:58 - 112:03)
the I feel like when I say like we we'll (112:00 - 112:06)
move in and Outcast it's not because I (112:03 - 112:08)
don't like Greg or Hannah or Bob it's (112:06 - 112:10)
