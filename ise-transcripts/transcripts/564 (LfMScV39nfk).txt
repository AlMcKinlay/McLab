[Music] (0:13 - 0:26)
what's up everyone welcome to the (0:23 - 0:29)
564th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:26 - 0:31)
it's super effective I'm your host Steve (0:29 - 0:33)
with me is Hannah (0:31 - 0:35)
I actually caught three Cleaver (0:33 - 0:37)
yesterday none of them were shiny or (0:35 - 0:40)
tiny or huge or anything like that but (0:37 - 0:42)
free comic book day inspired me to (0:40 - 0:43)
actually get outside and walk around a (0:42 - 0:44)
little bit instead of just doing chores (0:43 - 0:47)
all day not Niantic free comic book day (0:44 - 0:50)
yes I didn't get any Cleavers I didn't (0:47 - 0:51)
even (0:50 - 0:53)
I didn't even look I mean the thing said (0:51 - 0:55)
hey there's flavors went cool (0:53 - 0:58)
Greg's here I'm here guess what (0:55 - 0:59)
everybody (0:58 - 1:02)
I have (0:59 - 1:04)
repaired (1:02 - 1:07)
the fence so I don't have I can let my (1:04 - 1:09)
dogs out my backyard now I suggest that (1:07 - 1:11)
none of you come and actually look at (1:09 - 1:13)
how we hacked together bits and pieces (1:11 - 1:16)
to make a fence because it's total trash (1:13 - 1:20)
yard but I can let my dogs out in the (1:16 - 1:21)
morning (1:20 - 1:23)
I don't have to worry about it they can (1:21 - 1:26)
just run free in our yard and eat all (1:23 - 1:27)
the things that are left in our yard by (1:26 - 1:29)
other crows I think it's really funny to (1:27 - 1:32)
feed our dogs (1:29 - 1:35)
but I have a new sense of freedom in my (1:32 - 1:36)
life (1:35 - 1:39)
life is nature is healing (1:36 - 1:41)
I've hacked together a fence (1:39 - 1:44)
if it works it works yeah I mean it was (1:41 - 1:48)
it holds the dogs in exactly (1:44 - 1:50)
uh well speaking of Cleaver the the the (1:48 - 1:53)
cleaver event happened (1:50 - 1:56)
um I I Greg probably would have came out (1:53 - 1:59)
with me but they were uh doing what (1:56 - 2:01)
magic the Gathering and it was that (1:59 - 2:04)
Magic con conning up the magic will and (2:01 - 2:06)
I and (2:04 - 2:10)
a bunch of other people were at magiccon (2:06 - 2:13)
and we saw everything the first day on (2:10 - 2:17)
Friday because it's small is it oh okay (2:13 - 2:20)
yeah uh Mall of America was not busy (2:17 - 2:21)
which is really weird for a Saturday (2:20 - 2:23)
yeah I think nothing's been busy and I'm (2:21 - 2:25)
trying to figure out well I know it was (2:23 - 2:27)
prom weekend because we went to go get (2:25 - 2:30)
food and a million people showed up (2:27 - 2:33)
in prom outfits and I'm like (2:30 - 2:36)
wait you go to the Nicolette Diner no we (2:33 - 2:39)
drove up Northeast to go to punch here's (2:36 - 2:41)
the thing though I was waiting in line (2:39 - 2:44)
for the bathroom and the problem (2:41 - 2:47)
guy and gal came out of the bathroom (2:44 - 2:51)
together and I judged them I looked (2:47 - 2:52)
right in their eyes and said that is (2:51 - 2:56)
appropriate or were you the old white (2:52 - 3:00)
man judging the the kids (2:56 - 3:03)
I have age I have a role to play and my (3:00 - 3:06)
and my role is to look at the (3:03 - 3:07)
ugly (3:06 - 3:09)
would have been less judgmental if it (3:07 - 3:11)
was two guys but no it was a guy and a (3:09 - 3:13)
girl I know what they were they were (3:11 - 3:15)
trying to fix her dress or whatever (3:13 - 3:16)
they're trying yeah they were trying to (3:15 - 3:18)
fix their dress I'm sure because you're (3:16 - 3:20)
Adam put you're at the punch pizza for (3:18 - 3:22)
your prom dinner I'm like you know back (3:20 - 3:25)
in my day we went for an expensive meal (3:22 - 3:28)
Olive Garden I think my problem we went (3:25 - 3:32)
to get ice cream so we're good there is (3:28 - 3:34)
a Japanese restaurant downtown called (3:32 - 3:38)
kigawa that we drove all the way to (3:34 - 3:39)
downtown (3:38 - 3:43)
45 minutes to get dinner so we could (3:39 - 3:46)
turn around and drive 45 minutes back to (3:43 - 3:48)
the suburbs because we didn't want to (3:46 - 3:49)
eat at any of the restaurants in our (3:48 - 3:51)
area (3:49 - 3:54)
that makes sense yeah it's prom time and (3:51 - 3:56)
it's graduation time and that might all (3:54 - 3:58)
have something to do with it oh yeah (3:56 - 4:00)
there's a huge graduation at the (3:58 - 4:02)
convention center so (4:00 - 4:04)
magic kindness happening so there's a (4:02 - 4:07)
bunch of magic Geeks then as we were (4:04 - 4:08)
pretty sure it's Metro State University (4:07 - 4:10)
who's having their graduation ceremony (4:08 - 4:13)
so there's a million people there and (4:10 - 4:18)
then on the lower floor was the (4:13 - 4:22)
girls dance competitions so there's also (4:18 - 4:24)
a ton of tiny girls with severe buns and (4:22 - 4:26)
lots of makeup on all sort underground (4:24 - 4:29)
yesterday was wild we're like I don't (4:26 - 4:31)
know what's happening and it's a lot (4:29 - 4:33)
right now (4:31 - 4:35)
I'm sure at least like two of those (4:33 - 4:38)
dance girls are also into Magic (4:35 - 4:39)
Ally (4:38 - 4:40)
they (4:39 - 4:41)
[Music] (4:40 - 4:43)
have some spells up there they're out (4:41 - 4:46)
there spell slinging slapping cards (4:43 - 4:49)
boosting making booster packs making (4:46 - 4:52)
trades deals The Whole Nine Yards (4:49 - 4:54)
uh let's start with the Pokemon Go News (4:52 - 4:57)
uh we have two specific articles (4:54 - 5:00)
uh I guess uh Hannah was very excited (4:57 - 5:03)
about the Larvesta stuff last week and (5:00 - 5:05)
then (5:03 - 5:05)
for for our audio listeners I believe (5:06 - 5:11)
Hannah rolled her eyes (5:08 - 5:11)
not paying attention (5:12 - 5:15)
um (5:14 - 5:17)
uh so you know laresto's in Pokemon go (5:15 - 5:20)
now uh there was some confusion on (5:17 - 5:23)
niantic's own blog post of how Larvesta (5:20 - 5:24)
was hatching through eggs got (5:23 - 5:27)
clarification during the show that was (5:24 - 5:28)
nice (5:27 - 5:31)
um this is off the selfroad.com not to (5:28 - 5:32)
be confused with the Silph Road (5:31 - 5:35)
subreddit which is the same thing kind (5:32 - 5:38)
of but they do longer more journalistic (5:35 - 5:39)
articles (5:38 - 5:42)
on the website that no one visits and (5:39 - 5:44)
then post it to the subreddit where most (5:42 - 5:45)
people don't read the article they just (5:44 - 5:47)
read the comments of people complaining (5:45 - 5:49)
about the article uh we have the article (5:47 - 5:51)
here (5:49 - 5:53)
um so this is also what's the word for (5:51 - 5:58)
it uh user curated data (5:53 - 6:01)
there's probably a better term for that (5:58 - 6:03)
curate it's not the right word but my (6:01 - 6:05)
brain's not coming up with the right one (6:03 - 6:08)
like the self-road like worked with a (6:05 - 6:09)
bunch a bunch of people work together to (6:08 - 6:13)
get as much data user gathered data (6:09 - 6:15)
that's probably there this is the the (6:13 - 6:17)
user gather data stuff you know take it (6:15 - 6:18)
for what it's worth it's kind of why we (6:17 - 6:20)
know what the shiny odds for Community (6:18 - 6:22)
are because we've had so many Community (6:20 - 6:23)
Days and so much reporting that (6:22 - 6:27)
eventually the math lines up and Niantic (6:23 - 6:29)
will never tell us so (6:27 - 6:32)
um this is this is some data so uh if (6:29 - 6:34)
you don't know uh Larvesta is hatching (6:32 - 6:38)
from 2 5 and 10K eggs and the Silph Road (6:34 - 6:42)
was determined to see how uh rare (6:38 - 6:44)
hatching Larvesta was (6:42 - 6:46)
uh researchers they didn't say how many (6:44 - 6:49)
researchers but they they did 364 eggs (6:46 - 6:52)
in total and observed that Larvesta (6:49 - 6:57)
hatched at a 0.82 chance that's less (6:52 - 7:00)
than one percent uh they are 95 (6:57 - 7:03)
confident in that with an interval of (7:00 - 7:07)
0.23 and 2.18 that's the science slash (7:03 - 7:09)
data part that I don't understand I know (7:07 - 7:12)
that they they're like this is our error (7:09 - 7:13)
I don't know how they get there that's (7:12 - 7:15)
way more complicated math I just (7:13 - 7:16)
understand that it's less than one (7:15 - 7:19)
percent (7:16 - 7:19)
um so they they said they hatched 143 2K (7:19 - 7:28)
eggs with one Larvesta 148 5K eggs with (7:23 - 7:34)
one Larvesta and uh 73 10K eggs with one (7:28 - 7:37)
larvest (7:34 - 7:37)
oh yeah on each end of it this is a bad (7:42 - 7:46)
hatch rate this is not an event where (7:44 - 7:48)
you're actually gonna get a Larvesta (7:46 - 7:50)
it's also tough because (7:48 - 7:53)
it is still (7:50 - 7:55)
like RNG (7:53 - 7:56)
and (7:55 - 8:00)
143 is a good (7:56 - 8:03)
but it's not a great amount right like (8:00 - 8:06)
you need a lot more which is why like (8:03 - 8:09)
their interval is such a huge swing (8:06 - 8:11)
because Oh you mean the point two three (8:09 - 8:16)
the 2.8 yeah because 140 like (8:11 - 8:19)
one in a hundred odds but we all know (8:16 - 8:23)
that RNG doesn't necessarily line up to (8:19 - 8:24)
100 so like if you really wanted to get (8:23 - 8:26)
close to what actual Arts are you want (8:24 - 8:28)
much higher rates like 500 a thousand (8:26 - 8:30)
because then you have so many variances (8:28 - 8:33)
of 100 you can get very much closer to (8:30 - 8:36)
what the actual Arts are so like the 10K (8:33 - 8:39)
egg thing that even hit a hundred (8:36 - 8:41)
um so like the confidence level in (8:39 - 8:44)
between those is like okay well it looks (8:41 - 8:47)
that way but you also didn't go over 100 (8:44 - 8:49)
so you could have just had the RNG (8:47 - 8:52)
workout for you no matter what the odds (8:49 - 8:57)
are bad like like it does look not great (8:52 - 9:00)
and and to cap it all off as this event (8:57 - 9:01)
is ending right before we started (9:00 - 9:04)
recording today Niantic push to push (9:01 - 9:07)
notification in Pokemon go asking have (9:04 - 9:10)
you evolved Larvesta into Volcarona yet (9:07 - 9:14)
no no don't didn't get one in this (9:10 - 9:16)
Pokemon (9:14 - 9:17)
um (9:16 - 9:18)
uh (9:17 - 9:21)
they they did 364 eggs total which is a (9:18 - 9:23)
lot of eggs I kind of wish they made it (9:21 - 9:26)
to 500 I feel like 500 is like the first (9:23 - 9:29)
bottom threshold I would maybe go to but (9:26 - 9:31)
yeah but you don't have have hatch (9:29 - 9:34)
distance or decreased hatch distance in (9:31 - 9:35)
this event you're just hatching these (9:34 - 9:36)
eggs (9:35 - 9:39)
as you go right yeah even if you're (9:36 - 9:41)
trying you can't get it (9:39 - 9:44)
also since they aren't just handing out (9:41 - 9:47)
incubators like these people have to pay (9:44 - 9:49)
to do this research which is like I (9:47 - 9:50)
don't blame them for not going higher (9:49 - 9:52)
numbers and I'd be like no no thanks I (9:50 - 9:56)
have to do what no for denied (9:52 - 9:58)
I bless their soul I don't remember who (9:56 - 10:00)
messaged me it was it was like the day (9:58 - 10:03)
after uh Larvesta started and they said (10:00 - 10:06)
they said hey did you hatch a Larvesta (10:03 - 10:08)
yet me and my friends have hatched about (10:06 - 10:10)
50 eggs so far and none of us has got (10:08 - 10:11)
have gotten one (10:10 - 10:14)
and this is before I knew that (10:11 - 10:17)
it was .82 percent hatch rate according (10:14 - 10:20)
to the Silph Road and I said nah man I (10:17 - 10:23)
gave up on eggs like four years ago when (10:20 - 10:24)
I (10:23 - 10:28)
it was it was an adventure week event I (10:24 - 10:31)
want to say it was when I don't think it (10:28 - 10:33)
was the Kanto fossils so the next set of (10:31 - 10:35)
fossils would have been the Hoenn (10:33 - 10:37)
fossils (10:35 - 10:39)
or maybe it was it was like the first (10:37 - 10:41)
ever Adventure week that they really (10:39 - 10:44)
pushed egg stuff and I I spent like 20 (10:41 - 10:46)
or 30 dollars on incubators because I (10:44 - 10:47)
was like oh this sounds really exciting (10:46 - 10:49)
this is really great maybe it was the (10:47 - 10:50)
Kanto stuff but it was like the first (10:49 - 10:53)
time they could be shiny I think maybe (10:50 - 10:57)
um but I was so disappointed (10:53 - 11:01)
with the money spent on incubators (10:57 - 11:05)
that I swore off incubators and I think (11:01 - 11:08)
since then I have maybe only purchased (11:05 - 11:09)
incubators (11:08 - 11:12)
in relation to them being in a bundle (11:09 - 11:14)
with other things I wanted like raid (11:12 - 11:16)
passes (11:14 - 11:18)
but I've never just been like oh I'm I'm (11:16 - 11:21)
gonna crack down and get myself 10 (11:18 - 11:24)
incubators for the weekend I just (11:21 - 11:26)
I I can't think of an egg event that (11:24 - 11:28)
actually has been (11:26 - 11:29)
good (11:28 - 11:33)
[Laughter] (11:29 - 11:33)
New Egg events out there but I I can't (11:33 - 11:37)
think of one I can't think of a single (11:36 - 11:39)
egg event where I was like man I wish I (11:37 - 11:40)
would have bought incubators that event (11:39 - 11:43)
actually ended up being good odds (11:40 - 11:45)
yeah I know I've purchased incubators (11:43 - 11:47)
for a couple of events in the last maybe (11:45 - 11:50)
just one event in the last few years but (11:47 - 11:53)
it's never I never succeed it's just a (11:50 - 11:55)
little bit of extra excitement from (11:53 - 11:57)
hatching the things which is not worth (11:55 - 11:58)
it (11:57 - 12:02)
like I have a bunch of incubators from (11:58 - 12:04)
past bundles I just I usually end up (12:02 - 12:07)
saving them for (12:04 - 12:09)
like a go Fest (12:07 - 12:11)
and I only like saved them for the sake (12:09 - 12:14)
of like okay I've been sitting on a (12:11 - 12:15)
bunch of 10K eggs now I can like put (12:14 - 12:17)
these in incubators they're gone now I (12:15 - 12:20)
can only collect 2K eggs from the go (12:17 - 12:22)
Fest event like I use them very (12:20 - 12:24)
strategically like I could have used the (12:22 - 12:26)
incubators and tried to go for Larvesta (12:24 - 12:29)
but also like (12:26 - 12:30)
we say this time and time again Pokemon (12:29 - 12:34)
go is like this long con game where you (12:30 - 12:35)
they they introduce something new and (12:34 - 12:38)
exciting they make it incredibly rare I (12:35 - 12:40)
get it to a point like they want to (12:38 - 12:43)
extend the length of their game but we (12:40 - 12:45)
all know that Larvesta will eventually (12:43 - 12:48)
become more common as long as this game (12:45 - 12:52)
keeps going right yeah that's true uh (12:48 - 12:54)
you know it's the whole like Gibble you (12:52 - 12:57)
know they put they put Gibble in (12:54 - 13:00)
raids for whatever go Fest that was I (12:57 - 13:02)
think that was the meloetta go Fest (13:00 - 13:05)
and then a year later Gibble Community (13:02 - 13:07)
Day yeah (13:05 - 13:09)
which is not a complaint in itself it's (13:07 - 13:12)
just you know they they double dip very (13:09 - 13:15)
frequently this is not new I I think (13:12 - 13:17)
they sort of like shot themselves in the (13:15 - 13:20)
foot a little bit with like you're now (13:17 - 13:23)
what are we at seven years of this game (13:20 - 13:26)
yeah we all know (13:23 - 13:29)
the pattern of (13:26 - 13:33)
if you can just wait a year (13:29 - 13:36)
it won't be this hard and it's probably (13:33 - 13:37)
going to take six months for the people (13:36 - 13:40)
who are into PVP to be like oh no this (13:37 - 13:42)
is really good and you want one and at (13:40 - 13:43)
that point you're like well I missed the (13:42 - 13:44)
first one because they want to spend (13:43 - 13:46)
money so I'm just going to wait so like (13:44 - 13:50)
they've set up this expectation of their (13:46 - 13:51)
own game (13:50 - 13:53)
that (13:51 - 13:55)
also (13:53 - 13:58)
um we can get these in the regular (13:55 - 14:02)
standard games so yeah yep (13:58 - 14:06)
the magic uh is only for the people who (14:02 - 14:08)
have only only ever play Pokemon go and (14:06 - 14:11)
I have a feeling that is a diminishing (14:08 - 14:13)
or for the people you still want to (14:11 - 14:15)
catch and have that pokedex entry or (14:13 - 14:17)
yeah in this case hatch and have that (14:15 - 14:20)
pokedex entry this is (14:17 - 14:21)
people out there that really like (14:20 - 14:24)
larvista yeah (14:21 - 14:26)
we know one (14:24 - 14:28)
this is kind of comparable to Noibat and (14:26 - 14:33)
I think it took two years yeah (14:28 - 14:33)
come on (14:36 - 14:43)
how dare you very bad has speaker ears (14:38 - 14:46)
he does have speaker ears true very true (14:43 - 14:50)
but Larvesta has both future (14:46 - 14:50)
's Paradox form (14:50 - 14:55)
s yes (14:53 - 14:55)
very good uh (14:56 - 15:03)
so I I had this article already pulled (15:00 - 15:04)
for (15:03 - 15:07)
um this week's show this is our our last (15:04 - 15:10)
bit of Pokemon go news here uh which I (15:07 - 15:12)
saw everyone talking about and then (15:10 - 15:16)
there was a follow-up that I saw no one (15:12 - 15:17)
talking about (15:16 - 15:19)
you didn't see anyone talking about it (15:17 - 15:21)
no I didn't see anyone talking about the (15:19 - 15:22)
follow-up (15:21 - 15:24)
um (15:22 - 15:27)
so uh (15:24 - 15:29)
um I'll read the original article off (15:27 - 15:32)
nintendolife.com here uh this was posted (15:29 - 15:34)
on May 3rd believe it or not it's not (15:32 - 15:36)
butter Pokemon go has been around for (15:34 - 15:39)
seven years launching back in 2016 of (15:36 - 15:43)
July uh according to mobilegame.biz (15:39 - 15:46)
Pokemon goes monthly earnings for April (15:43 - 15:48)
of 2023 was significantly lower than (15:46 - 15:51)
March uh which itself was poor compared (15:48 - 15:55)
to February the app brought in 300 oh (15:51 - 15:59)
sorry 34.7 million dollars in April (15:55 - 16:03)
42.8 million in March and 58 million in (15:59 - 16:05)
February meaning the drop over the (16:03 - 16:08)
course of two months is about 40 percent (16:05 - 16:11)
while 34.7 million is a significant (16:08 - 16:14)
amount of cash April of 2023 marks the (16:11 - 16:16)
lowest earning period for the game since (16:14 - 16:19)
February of 2028 I'm trying to remember (16:16 - 16:22)
what like was that like ah gosh I can't (16:19 - 16:24)
remember what event that was (16:22 - 16:27)
um the reasoning behind this might be to (16:24 - 16:30)
the widespread negative reception to (16:27 - 16:32)
niantic's decision to increase the price (16:30 - 16:34)
of remote raid passes which started on (16:32 - 16:38)
April 20. 23. and then there was an (16:34 - 16:40)
update but I guess we'll stop there for (16:38 - 16:42)
now (16:40 - 16:42)
um (16:42 - 16:44)
yeah a lot of a lot of people were (16:42 - 16:47)
talking about this (16:44 - 16:47)
um (16:47 - 16:51)
which like (16:49 - 16:53)
I think the thing that I saw was like (16:51 - 16:56)
people being like we told you Niantic (16:53 - 16:59)
we're not spending the money but like my (16:56 - 17:01)
thought process was (16:59 - 17:04)
amazing knew this was going to happen (17:01 - 17:07)
they were very much like (17:04 - 17:10)
if we limit the money you spend we know (17:07 - 17:12)
we're not going to make like that's not (17:10 - 17:14)
the like if anyone should not be (17:12 - 17:16)
surprised it's Niantic they knew exactly (17:14 - 17:19)
like look I I think the decision was (17:16 - 17:21)
like bad and not great and obviously (17:19 - 17:24)
made people upset but they they had a (17:21 - 17:28)
choice Niantic had a choice of limiting (17:24 - 17:31)
raid passes because they want people to (17:28 - 17:33)
go outside and play the game that they (17:31 - 17:34)
want (17:33 - 17:37)
whether or not you agree with it Niantic (17:34 - 17:39)
wants you to play a game in a certain (17:37 - 17:41)
way or the other decision was (17:39 - 17:43)
stay at home continue buying rate passes (17:41 - 17:45)
do as many as you want until your (17:43 - 17:47)
heart's content and then they get easy I (17:45 - 17:49)
don't know easy money (17:47 - 17:52)
and they chose to not take the easy (17:49 - 17:54)
money and they want you to play the game (17:52 - 17:56)
in a certain way like (17:54 - 17:59)
this is shocking to no one well it was (17:56 - 18:01)
shocking to people online but to me I (17:59 - 18:04)
was like this right like yeah yes they (18:01 - 18:05)
are making less money because they (18:04 - 18:07)
limited one of their sources of course (18:05 - 18:10)
they're making less money in in-app (18:07 - 18:12)
purchases I am pretty certain that the (18:10 - 18:15)
statistic that this is counting is only (18:12 - 18:17)
in-app purchases so that's not taking (18:15 - 18:21)
into account say the go Fest tickets (18:17 - 18:23)
and that's where everybody is kind of (18:21 - 18:24)
actually (18:23 - 18:26)
has still (18:24 - 18:27)
if anybody still has excitement about (18:26 - 18:30)
this game go Fest is more likely to be (18:27 - 18:31)
one of those (18:30 - 18:33)
places that people are excited about (18:31 - 18:34)
yeah (18:33 - 18:38)
um so that combined with the fact that (18:34 - 18:41)
uh the events in this game have been bad (18:38 - 18:44)
recently just bad there's been no reason (18:41 - 18:47)
to pay for anything in game a lot of the (18:44 - 18:49)
time especially once you say see the (18:47 - 18:52)
Larvesta hatching rates (18:49 - 18:53)
yeah I think that was the thing that (18:52 - 18:55)
bothered me the most about all these (18:53 - 18:57)
articles or about people focusing on the (18:55 - 18:59)
remote rate pass stuff is if you just (18:57 - 19:00)
look at this whole season as a whole (18:59 - 19:04)
Rising Heroes it's it's bad it's a bad (19:00 - 19:06)
season and that's I mean you know like (19:04 - 19:08)
you know I played stuff also impacts it (19:06 - 19:10)
I think it's definitely a combination of (19:08 - 19:12)
those two things sure sure yeah yeah I'm (19:10 - 19:14)
not I'm not saying that it had nothing (19:12 - 19:15)
to do with the raid passes but even if (19:14 - 19:18)
you could spend as many raid passes as (19:15 - 19:20)
you wanted there there wasn't like (19:18 - 19:23)
very exciting (19:20 - 19:26)
parades to do like didn't they did they (19:23 - 19:28)
not in this season in Rising Heroes (19:26 - 19:30)
unless I'm forgetting something did they (19:28 - 19:33)
not bring back Ho-Oh and Lugia again (19:30 - 19:36)
like shiny top of bulu was new (19:33 - 19:39)
yeah yeah I think uh bulu was new yes (19:36 - 19:42)
and I think we're getting Finney in a (19:39 - 19:44)
week or two yeah for the first time and (19:42 - 19:46)
then there was a new shiny Genesect (19:44 - 19:47)
Drive (19:46 - 19:49)
form (19:47 - 19:52)
I think for our audio listeners Greg (19:49 - 19:54)
rolled there (19:52 - 19:54)
weird knockoff Transformer it doesn't (19:54 - 20:00)
even play music Genesect is great (19:57 - 20:02)
it's great yeah but there are a lot of (20:00 - 20:05)
forms that look no different (20:02 - 20:07)
looks different I mean it's not even (20:05 - 20:09)
like like the axis at least gets thicker (20:07 - 20:11)
and thinner yeah you get that SpongeBob (20:09 - 20:14)
it's really good nice thick form with (20:11 - 20:18)
two C's as the kids say (20:14 - 20:18)
um I've tried to like see if there's a (20:19 - 20:24)
listing of (20:21 - 20:24)
what the raids were for seasons of (20:24 - 20:28)
Heroes I'm looking (20:26 - 20:31)
yeah I I don't know I I can't think of (20:28 - 20:33)
like (20:31 - 20:33)
an event and like the last time I felt (20:33 - 20:39)
like Pokemon go was great was Vegas and (20:36 - 20:41)
I know that's like a huge exception (20:39 - 20:43)
because it was an in-person event and (20:41 - 20:45)
they had primals and Rayquaza came back (20:43 - 20:47)
and (20:45 - 20:48)
um (20:47 - 20:50)
and then yeah Rising Heroes has just (20:48 - 20:53)
been a real bummer of a season and I (20:50 - 20:55)
like like I was gonna say (20:53 - 20:56)
you know I've played plenty of games (20:55 - 20:58)
with season passes and sometimes you get (20:56 - 21:00)
a season that's kind of a dud and that's (20:58 - 21:03)
okay you know you can come back when the (21:00 - 21:06)
seasons change over here was March (21:03 - 21:08)
Tornadus (21:06 - 21:10)
thunderous (21:08 - 21:14)
Lugia with the Mega Charizard mega (21:10 - 21:17)
Metuchen and Mega Alakazam raids and (21:14 - 21:19)
then regilecki and Reggie Draco and we (21:17 - 21:22)
know how well those went (21:19 - 21:26)
uh metachin was new I think yep at that (21:22 - 21:29)
time magachem was new Mega (21:26 - 21:31)
but you only really need to do one yeah (21:29 - 21:33)
I think that yeah that one was like low (21:31 - 21:35)
Mega cost (21:33 - 21:35)
uh okay so then (21:36 - 21:42)
that was the original article going (21:40 - 21:44)
around on May 3rd and then the next day (21:42 - 21:46)
on May 4th (21:44 - 21:48)
which I saw a ton of people talking (21:46 - 21:50)
about yeah maybe I'm in different (21:48 - 21:53)
circles here uh (21:50 - 21:55)
so it was (21:53 - 22:00)
mobilegamer.biz uh highlighted or talked (21:55 - 22:03)
about the the money and then I a Niantic (22:00 - 22:04)
spokesperson doesn't say their name (22:03 - 22:06)
quote we generally don't comment on (22:04 - 22:08)
third party estimates of our Revenue as (22:06 - 22:10)
they are often incorrect which is the (22:08 - 22:12)
case here (22:10 - 22:16)
our Revenue so far in 2023 is up on last (22:12 - 22:18)
year (22:16 - 22:18)
uh and then they say we don't focus on (22:19 - 22:22)
month-to-month Trends because they (22:21 - 22:25)
fluctuate based on major Live Events (22:22 - 22:27)
this year's changes have already (22:25 - 22:30)
increased in-person rating to be fair I (22:27 - 22:32)
I believe that and we're excited to (22:30 - 22:35)
introduce exciting features over the (22:32 - 22:37)
coming months (22:35 - 22:39)
um so that those were their two comments (22:37 - 22:42)
they said on you know (22:39 - 22:45)
maybe that number's not correct well (22:42 - 22:46)
they didn't say the number was wrong (22:45 - 22:48)
they just said they don't focus on month (22:46 - 22:51)
to month the month to month is with the (22:48 - 22:54)
in-app purchases that statistic from the (22:51 - 22:56)
original article is correct their in-app (22:54 - 22:57)
purchases have gone down a significant (22:56 - 23:00)
amount they're just saying we usually (22:57 - 23:03)
focus on year to year instead and this (23:00 - 23:06)
year is up so it's a different thing (23:03 - 23:08)
yeah every company focuses on the year (23:06 - 23:12)
end because if you focus solely on month (23:08 - 23:14)
to month like you are not (23:12 - 23:18)
like you're not honestly (23:14 - 23:20)
there are so many fluctuations in how (23:18 - 23:23)
people spend money and what happens and (23:20 - 23:25)
weather events that affect like a (23:23 - 23:29)
million different things uh like (23:25 - 23:30)
corporations like quarters because (23:29 - 23:33)
they'll certainly get on their employees (23:30 - 23:35)
like this three-month average was down (23:33 - 23:37)
and we need to pick it up for the year (23:35 - 23:39)
or this three month average was great (23:37 - 23:42)
keep it up we want you to do more so I (23:39 - 23:44)
mean (23:42 - 23:45)
again (23:44 - 23:48)
we aren't seeing their entire Revenue (23:45 - 23:50)
stream right like we don't see (23:48 - 23:52)
everything that they go into we don't (23:50 - 23:55)
see any of the other metrics that go in (23:52 - 23:58)
like we are looking at one metric that (23:55 - 24:00)
probably makes up their giant Revenue (23:58 - 24:02)
stream (24:00 - 24:04)
um and those are going to fluctuate over (24:02 - 24:07)
a million reasons so I mean they do say (24:04 - 24:09)
our revenues are often incorrect which (24:07 - 24:12)
is the case here they are saying like (24:09 - 24:14)
you aren't getting all of the numbers (24:12 - 24:19)
and so you can't make a great call off (24:14 - 24:22)
of the limited view that you have which (24:19 - 24:24)
I will say is 100 accurate and which is (24:22 - 24:26)
why it's it's (24:24 - 24:29)
frustrating when people are like look (24:26 - 24:32)
they're down this week I'm like yeah but (24:29 - 24:34)
did they even consider the Pokemon go on (24:32 - 24:36)
Kung Fu tea partnership which is (24:34 - 24:38)
probably why they're up for the month (24:36 - 24:43)
yeah that was probably a killer (24:38 - 24:46)
we didn't yeah I don't know I don't know (24:43 - 24:48)
what Kung Fu tea is but there is a (24:46 - 24:51)
partnership but yeah you're uh yeah you (24:48 - 24:53)
you both are correct like those numbers (24:51 - 24:55)
are only in-app purchases I'm joking (24:53 - 24:58)
about this tea deal but I I actually (24:55 - 25:00)
would be curious what the (24:58 - 25:03)
money situation for that is (25:00 - 25:05)
um you know there's the you know people (25:03 - 25:08)
like to say like Niantic selling our (25:05 - 25:11)
data location data which I don't know (25:08 - 25:13)
who's buying it that they can't get from (25:11 - 25:15)
Google or Target or anywhere else that (25:13 - 25:17)
is selling your location data but like (25:15 - 25:19)
that is that is also probably Revenue (25:17 - 25:21)
yeah I mean when we say we don't know (25:19 - 25:24)
who's buying it generally marketing (25:21 - 25:26)
people are taking every ounce of data (25:24 - 25:28)
they can to repackage it and sell it to (25:26 - 25:30)
the corporations who want it so like (25:28 - 25:32)
Target users we all know Target uses (25:30 - 25:36)
their own internal tracking for some of (25:32 - 25:38)
the scary things that happens if you use (25:36 - 25:39)
your phone a lot of Target because they (25:38 - 25:42)
get really they really do watch where (25:39 - 25:44)
you go we'll send you targeted ads based (25:42 - 25:46)
off of where you visited on your last (25:44 - 25:48)
one uh there have been a couple of (25:46 - 25:50)
embarrassing stories which you can look (25:48 - 25:53)
up on your own (25:50 - 25:53)
um (25:54 - 25:56)
I mean I guess I guess we'll see going (25:57 - 26:02)
into the summer the summer is niantic's (25:58 - 26:05)
Christmas it is their busiest (26:02 - 26:08)
North American Summer America and (26:05 - 26:11)
Japanese summer anything anything south (26:08 - 26:14)
of the Equator you're on your own so I (26:11 - 26:17)
guess we'll see you going forward but (26:14 - 26:19)
Niantic says people are doing more (26:17 - 26:23)
in-person rates well yes they're being (26:19 - 26:25)
forced too yeah (26:23 - 26:27)
they're doing the thing we're forcing (26:25 - 26:30)
them to do winning uh I will say that I (26:27 - 26:33)
did I normally go to so the cleaver was (26:30 - 26:37)
like 11 to 2 uh and I know usually I (26:33 - 26:39)
think most people I think most hardcore (26:37 - 26:41)
Pokemon fans when there's an event they (26:39 - 26:44)
go right at the time it starts because (26:41 - 26:47)
that's the most amount of people I will (26:44 - 26:49)
say though again this probably location (26:47 - 26:51)
when I went to Mall of America I didn't (26:49 - 26:53)
get there until one so there was only (26:51 - 26:55)
one hour of the event and it was almost (26:53 - 26:58)
every Cleaver raid filled two hours into (26:55 - 27:01)
the event and Maul was not super busy (26:58 - 27:03)
and I kind of figured that like my my (27:01 - 27:05)
worry was like oh like I can still still (27:03 - 27:07)
look Cleaver like I have primals and I (27:05 - 27:08)
have like I have more than enough (27:07 - 27:10)
Pokemon to solo so not that big of a (27:08 - 27:13)
deal but I was shocked I was like wow (27:10 - 27:14)
the mall's not busy the event's been (27:13 - 27:16)
active for two hours and people are (27:14 - 27:18)
still jumping in to do Cleaver so that (27:16 - 27:20)
was like that was cool the nice thing (27:18 - 27:22)
about it was that the raids rolled over (27:20 - 27:24)
each hour so if you finished a Cleaver (27:22 - 27:26)
at One Gym in the first hour you could (27:24 - 27:29)
do it once the hour rolled over again (27:26 - 27:32)
wait wait really yeah oh now I kind of (27:29 - 27:34)
regret not going out earlier (27:32 - 27:37)
I have so many in-person raid passes (27:34 - 27:39)
you've I mean to be fair I'm not (27:37 - 27:42)
surprised that the mall was dead because (27:39 - 27:45)
yesterday was one of the first warm days (27:42 - 27:47)
we've had yeah it was really nice it's (27:45 - 27:49)
been a while some people are not people (27:47 - 27:52)
were not inside except at the convention (27:49 - 27:53)
center which was packed full of people (27:52 - 27:56)
doing events so that was all all gyms it (27:53 - 27:58)
would be it was pretty much three (27:56 - 28:00)
Cleavers for every gym (27:58 - 28:02)
oh huh (28:00 - 28:05)
had they done that before (28:02 - 28:05)
I don't know (28:05 - 28:09)
I think that with the avalog raid day it (28:07 - 28:11)
also worked that way if I remember it (28:09 - 28:16)
correctly there was another hello there (28:11 - 28:16)
yeah there was a there was a husuanian (28:16 - 28:21)
Avalon red day the day before Christmas (28:18 - 28:24)
yeah you were doing avalogs on Christmas (28:21 - 28:25)
Eve Greg (28:24 - 28:28)
I did a ton of those I was excited about (28:25 - 28:30)
that (28:28 - 28:32)
I can't catch them in a luxury ball (28:30 - 28:33)
which (28:32 - 28:36)
immediately dampens anything that I want (28:33 - 28:38)
to do in go I have three ball choices (28:36 - 28:41)
and they're all bad what if Niantic sold (28:38 - 28:43)
you five luxury balls for five dollars (28:41 - 28:45)
no I'm not giving that company money but (28:43 - 28:49)
they're luxury yeah but the luxury balls (28:45 - 28:51)
for free in my other games that's not (28:49 - 28:53)
true there are three thousand poke (28:51 - 28:55)
dollars yeah but I also can wander (28:53 - 28:57)
around and just find Pokey dollars on (28:55 - 28:58)
the ground and beat up people for their (28:57 - 29:01)
lunch money I mean if I can go beat up (28:58 - 29:03)
people for in real life for luxury balls (29:01 - 29:06)
look I might do that but you should have (29:03 - 29:08)
shook down the prom date when they left (29:06 - 29:11)
the bathroom I mean I was going to eyes (29:08 - 29:14)
on you kids our eyes man it's time to (29:11 - 29:16)
battle you two are in the bathroom I (29:14 - 29:17)
don't care it's the double battle I got (29:16 - 29:20)
experience it's veteran time and you (29:17 - 29:21)
kids ain't getting off Victory Road (29:20 - 29:24)
don't make it to prom because he got (29:21 - 29:25)
beat down by an old guy waiting for a (29:24 - 29:26)
bathroom (29:25 - 29:28)
well (29:26 - 29:30)
we're gonna shake you down and run some (29:28 - 29:33)
ads unless you're a premium subscriber (29:30 - 29:37)
and then you get an ad free break so you (29:33 - 29:39)
should just send us money well you are (29:37 - 29:40)
because you're a premium so you're (29:39 - 29:41)
you're just sending the money directly (29:40 - 29:43)
you're bypassing the middleman at that (29:41 - 29:49)
point so capitalism it's great (29:43 - 29:53)
and we are back from our break (29:49 - 29:55)

a great product that we're just gonna (30:16 - 30:24)
struggle with starting June 8th we say I (30:20 - 30:26)
say we like I have any interest in (30:24 - 30:28)
playing the TCG we were we were blessed (30:26 - 30:31)
with direwolf digital no longer (30:28 - 30:34)
live will officially launch around the (30:31 - 30:37)
world I I don't think it's in Japan uh (30:34 - 30:42)
on June 8th 2023 on iOS Android Mac OS (30:37 - 30:44)
and windowed devices following the (30:42 - 30:47)
current beta period ahead of the release (30:44 - 30:50)
of the tabletop version ahead of the (30:47 - 30:51)
release of the tabletop version the (30:50 - 30:52)
latest expansion of the best-selling (30:51 - 30:53)
Pokemon they always say it's the best (30:52 - 30:54)
selling (30:53 - 30:58)
it will be playable uh at 10 A.M gonna (30:54 - 31:02)
say of our mediocre selling game (30:58 - 31:05)
cards this one's this one's a sleeper (31:02 - 31:07)
it's been a snooze boy we did a bad job (31:05 - 31:09)
on this one but we hope you buy our next (31:07 - 31:12)
game and the TCG (31:09 - 31:14)
yeah that would be refreshing though so (31:12 - 31:16)
I'm gonna be like look (31:14 - 31:18)
Masters did that look we made a bad game (31:16 - 31:21)
but we're gonna fix it (31:18 - 31:23)
I like the last segment Hannah was like (31:21 - 31:25)
oh I saw people talking about this you (31:23 - 31:26)
know what I see people talking about (31:25 - 31:28)
they're still talking about the cards (31:26 - 31:33)
being stolen two years ago hey guys (31:28 - 31:36)
my Master's pull rates are suffering (31:33 - 31:38)
because of that theft still to this day (31:36 - 31:41)
I haven't pulled a good five star this (31:38 - 31:45)
since the criminals took all of the luck (31:41 - 31:47)
from that factory yeah maybe that's the (31:45 - 31:49)
reason I never get any shinies and go (31:47 - 31:52)
yeah it's all connected all stolen from (31:49 - 31:54)
the factory (31:52 - 31:54)
uh in addition to celebrate the official (31:54 - 32:00)
launch of the Pokemon TCG Live players (31:57 - 32:02)
who log into the game between May 2nd (32:00 - 32:08)
that's now and June 6th we'll receive a (32:02 - 32:11)
custom customization (32:08 - 32:13)
They will receive special customization (32:11 - 32:16)
accessories including a coin a card (32:13 - 32:19)
sleeve and a deck box (32:16 - 32:22)
they look okay here (32:19 - 32:26)
so it just says Global beta on them with (32:22 - 32:27)
a Pokeball (32:26 - 32:30)
oh no those are ugly (32:27 - 32:33)
wowzers why would you want to like deal (32:30 - 32:34)
with beta to get that up because you (32:33 - 32:36)
want you want to be that day one player (32:34 - 32:39)
Greg you want to show in five years when (32:36 - 32:41)
everyone I'm sure is loving the Pokemon (32:39 - 32:44)
trading card game live you can be like I (32:41 - 32:46)
was an OG I was here when it was (32:44 - 32:49)
suffering you know I did that (32:46 - 32:52)
faulty mindset for World of Warcraft (32:49 - 32:55)
where I thought yeah I'm going to pay (32:52 - 33:00)
the most money to be the most first (32:55 - 33:03)
I might as well spend the 300 to tattoo (33:00 - 33:08)
sucker on my arm like Bobby did (33:03 - 33:08)
I haven't seen this tattoo from Bobby (33:08 - 33:12)
it's because it's hidden he doesn't want (33:10 - 33:14)
to show it oh that makes a makeup (33:12 - 33:16)
coverage (33:14 - 33:17)
um (33:16 - 33:20)
uh okay so I guess the technical aspects (33:17 - 33:24)
of this if if you're still playing TCG (33:20 - 33:27)
oh Pokemon Trading Card Game Online not (33:24 - 33:30)
to be confused very similar names I (33:27 - 33:32)
recall this tcgl (33:30 - 33:36)
yeah or just L because it's not great (33:32 - 33:37)
[Laughter] (33:36 - 33:39)
um (33:37 - 33:39)
once you move your stuff from online to (33:41 - 33:47)
live you can't go backwards uh but you (33:44 - 33:50)
will have to merge it (33:47 - 33:54)
I'm assuming around the time of June 8th (33:50 - 33:56)
what they always told us after they (33:54 - 33:58)
delayed this thing multiple times (33:56 - 34:00)
remember this was supposed to come out (33:58 - 34:03)
before brilliant Diamond shining Pearl (34:00 - 34:06)
all right and then they said early next (34:03 - 34:07)
year (34:06 - 34:10)
and then they were like actually we (34:07 - 34:12)
don't know (34:10 - 34:12)
where they can't where they they said (34:15 - 34:19)
spring and it's still technically spring (34:17 - 34:22)
and spring spring for a while it's (34:19 - 34:24)
spring for at least another month (34:22 - 34:25)
um (34:24 - 34:27)
so they said when when live was gonna (34:25 - 34:30)
officially launch that they would then (34:27 - 34:35)
Sunset slash close online altogether (34:30 - 34:39)
um so I think the best plan of action is (34:35 - 34:41)
still to redeem your code cards (34:39 - 34:43)
in (34:41 - 34:45)
ptcgo (34:43 - 34:48)
open them there and then merge them over (34:45 - 34:51)
now live does a thing where online (34:48 - 34:53)
doesn't live will only let you have a (34:51 - 34:56)
total of four cards Max (34:53 - 34:59)
and you can't get any more than that (34:56 - 35:03)
which there is no trading in live so the (34:59 - 35:05)
benefit of having more you know 10 (35:03 - 35:08)
Mewtwo exes was you could trade six of (35:05 - 35:10)
them (35:08 - 35:11)
um (35:10 - 35:14)
but I believe if you enlive if you open (35:11 - 35:19)
like a fifth the skeleturge ex it will (35:14 - 35:21)
turn into like a dust and then you can (35:19 - 35:24)
use the dust to (35:21 - 35:26)
whatever it's either it either turns (35:24 - 35:28)
into dust or you just can't pull it at (35:26 - 35:31)
all and in that case (35:28 - 35:33)
you get something else instead I can't (35:31 - 35:35)
remember that exact specifics because (35:33 - 35:37)
again once you merge your collection you (35:35 - 35:40)
can't go backwards but also (35:37 - 35:42)
scarlet and violet is not accessible and (35:40 - 35:44)
online so they kind of were forcing your (35:42 - 35:47)
hand at that point to be like well if (35:44 - 35:48)
you want to play standard you kind of (35:47 - 35:51)
have to move forward (35:48 - 35:51)
[Music] (35:51 - 35:53)
um (35:51 - 35:53)
it it says that the live is developed (35:53 - 35:59)
and published by the Pokemon company (35:57 - 36:02)
International so (35:59 - 36:04)
I don't know again the only thing that (36:02 - 36:06)
matters out of all of this is whenever (36:04 - 36:10)
direwolf digital's contract is over I'm (36:06 - 36:12)
waiting for that documentary I need to (36:10 - 36:13)
know (36:12 - 36:15)
I mean I'm gonna say that their contract (36:13 - 36:19)
is over June 8th 2023. (36:15 - 36:19)
non-disclosure agreement (36:26 - 36:29)
ah (36:28 - 36:33)
quality of those has changed recently (36:29 - 36:35)
I'm not super familiar with it but I (36:33 - 36:39)
don't want it so what unchanged direwolf (36:35 - 36:41)
digital tweets that's what I like okay (36:39 - 36:42)
here's what changed the labor department (36:41 - 36:45)
said that non-disclosure agreements when (36:42 - 36:47)
a person is let go an individual to not (36:45 - 36:49)
talk bad about their company are not (36:47 - 36:53)
valid so people who were laid off or let (36:49 - 36:54)
go (36:53 - 36:59)
often had their severance pay tied to (36:54 - 37:00)
not speaking ill about the company and (36:59 - 37:03)
the labor department said nah (37:00 - 37:05)
rip them a new one you'll still get your (37:03 - 37:07)
money according to us and then all (37:05 - 37:10)
shackles came off just look for look at (37:07 - 37:13)
that glass door boy things have just (37:10 - 37:16)
people are off into the future now that (37:13 - 37:18)
they're unfettered and free to talk bad (37:16 - 37:20)
about how bad that companies were and (37:18 - 37:23)
I'm living for every minute of it we we (37:20 - 37:25)
did have a couple tweets from direwolf (37:23 - 37:27)
digital that I think were for those that (37:25 - 37:30)
don't know direwolf digital makes (37:27 - 37:32)
a ton of games and they were making (37:30 - 37:34)
Pokemon Trading Card Game online and (37:32 - 37:36)
there was a couple tweets which I think (37:34 - 37:38)
have been deleted since that were pretty (37:36 - 37:41)
much like we wanted to do so much with (37:38 - 37:43)
PTC Geo but every time we wanted to do (37:41 - 37:46)
it the Pokemon company said no (37:43 - 37:48)
and that was kind of the gist of those (37:46 - 37:51)
tweets of like yeah this isn't our Pro (37:48 - 37:53)
like we know what we're doing finger (37:51 - 37:57)
away finger away finger wave (37:53 - 37:58)
um (37:57 - 38:01)
and Greg has said that like they Greg (37:58 - 38:02)
you said you played other games from (38:01 - 38:04)
direwolf digital and they were great oh (38:02 - 38:06)
they're great I mean they're doing (38:04 - 38:08)
um (38:06 - 38:11)
the root game uh (38:08 - 38:13)
uh so if you've played the board game (38:11 - 38:18)
root uh they have the um (38:13 - 38:21)
license to make that and (38:18 - 38:24)
I I mean full disclosure I I'm friends (38:21 - 38:28)
with with Patrick who made root but (38:24 - 38:31)
it's it's it's incredibly well done like (38:28 - 38:33)
it is (38:31 - 38:36)
like really good and all of their other (38:33 - 38:38)
games are really good like they have all (38:36 - 38:40)
the clanks for (38:38 - 38:42)
um digital games and they all work great (38:40 - 38:46)
like it is so obvious when you look at (38:42 - 38:48)
their other stuff and then look at (38:46 - 38:51)
Pokemon Trading Card Game Online you're (38:48 - 38:53)
like yeah you were you were not allowed (38:51 - 38:56)
to do anything and they never gave you (38:53 - 38:57)
money (38:56 - 38:59)
because I have I have played so many of (38:57 - 39:01)
the other games and I'm like these are (38:59 - 39:04)
fantastic and they update frequently (39:01 - 39:06)
like root has like 18 million expansions (39:04 - 39:08)
and they're always working on it so it's (39:06 - 39:10)
like also has a bunch of expansions (39:08 - 39:12)
don't they yeah (39:10 - 39:15)
Clinic has a ton they're also doing the (39:12 - 39:18)
tales of Xavier (39:15 - 39:21)
tabletop role-playing game like they are (39:18 - 39:24)
known in that arena for taking board (39:21 - 39:26)
games and card games and making them (39:24 - 39:28)
into really incredible (39:26 - 39:30)
video game products (39:28 - 39:35)
except for Pokemon so like try your own (39:30 - 39:38)
parallels about how the Pokemon company (39:35 - 39:40)
treated them (39:38 - 39:42)
yeah I mean like uh (39:40 - 39:45)
uh you know Wizards of the Coast made (39:42 - 39:49)
the card game for for two years three (39:45 - 39:52)
years and then they took it and it kind (39:49 - 39:54)
of got knocked (39:52 - 39:57)
well you know (39:54 - 39:59)
some would say that their card game is (39:57 - 40:02)
the best-selling card game yeah that's (39:59 - 40:06)
that's true of all time of all time (40:02 - 40:07)
[Music] (40:06 - 40:08)
um (40:07 - 40:12)
I you know speaking of a game that you (40:08 - 40:14)
know was kind of bad and then they they (40:12 - 40:17)
fixed it Pokemon Masters EX (40:14 - 40:19)
it it didn't have the best launch ever (40:17 - 40:22)
no it did not I think it's in a good (40:19 - 40:25)
place now yeah when they added smoocher (40:22 - 40:30)
lodge because that game skyrocketed (40:25 - 40:31)
um can't believe we missed this news (40:30 - 40:33)
this was at the end of April but uh (40:31 - 40:35)
Uniqlo is going to release Pokemon (40:33 - 40:38)
Master ex shirts (40:35 - 40:40)
uh that's pretty exciting uh we have (40:38 - 40:43)
discovered the fun fact about Mall of (40:40 - 40:45)
America there is no Uniqlo there for (40:43 - 40:48)
whatever reason I don't understand we (40:45 - 40:51)
have like 17 Walgreens in that mall and (40:48 - 40:54)
not one Uniqlo like get it together (40:51 - 40:57)
Walgreens is not that necessary I mean I (40:54 - 40:59)
understand you need headache medicine (40:57 - 41:01)
for dealing with them all but you maybe (40:59 - 41:03)
need two Walgreens at that point not not (41:01 - 41:06)
the over abundance and they could go (41:03 - 41:09)
into the now closed Citibank cafe or (41:06 - 41:14)
whatever then no no no I think I the (41:09 - 41:15)
Capital One Cafe disappeared but it's (41:14 - 41:17)
back now I think they may have just (41:15 - 41:20)
sometimes I'll like close a store and (41:17 - 41:22)
then they'd give you no notice and then (41:20 - 41:24)
like all of a sudden it's back and it's (41:22 - 41:26)
like supposed to be remodeled really (41:24 - 41:28)
fresh but had they finally given up on (41:26 - 41:31)
chicken guy is the Chicken Guy is gone (41:28 - 41:33)
yeah chicken guys put it there but (41:31 - 41:35)
they're expanding the Japanese grocery (41:33 - 41:39)
store they have that is good that is (41:35 - 41:42)
good it's also not surprise who was I (41:39 - 41:44)
talking to about (41:42 - 41:46)
why was it on this show let's talk about (41:44 - 41:49)
why flights to Minnesota were so cheap (41:46 - 41:51)
for yeah yeah we were talking about on (41:49 - 41:53)
this year so I mean it is not surprising (41:51 - 41:54)
that (41:53 - 41:57)
the Japanese store of the like one of (41:54 - 42:00)
the biggest Japanese tourist spots (41:57 - 42:02)
they're closing the plant store though (42:00 - 42:05)
Greg which plant store that was next to (42:02 - 42:08)
the candy store (42:05 - 42:08)
everybody thought the plant store was an (42:09 - 42:12)
extension of the candy store because (42:11 - 42:14)
they looked exactly the same oh yeah no (42:12 - 42:15)
the plant the plant store was 80 off (42:14 - 42:18)
everything they didn't have much (42:15 - 42:21)
got a couple plants who would go when (42:18 - 42:24)
you live in a state with a with one of (42:21 - 42:25)
the biggest (42:24 - 42:26)
plant (42:25 - 42:29)
groups Bachmann's amongst others why (42:26 - 42:31)
would you go to the Mall of America for (42:29 - 42:33)
a plan because you're also picking up (42:31 - 42:35)
your kayak in your Peloton (42:33 - 42:39)
so you need to also grab you know your (42:35 - 42:42)
your hibiscus on the way out yes the (42:39 - 42:46)
hibiscus plants that notoriously do so (42:42 - 42:50)
well in the Minnesota client climate (42:46 - 42:50)
that's announced an upcoming (42:51 - 42:55)
collaboration between it and Pokemon (42:53 - 42:58)
Master ZX you'll be able to wear your (42:55 - 43:00)
favorite Pokemon character and let the (42:58 - 43:02)
world know you're a Pokemon Master this (43:00 - 43:04)
is off silicon era by the way uh (43:02 - 43:09)
purchasing will begin mid June 2023. (43:04 - 43:10)
um (43:09 - 43:12)
I'm gonna say this (43:10 - 43:16)
if you look at the shirt of Leanne and (43:12 - 43:17)
Cynthia giving each other the Death (43:16 - 43:19)
Stare (43:17 - 43:21)
that was me and those two kids that (43:19 - 43:22)
punch (43:21 - 43:25)
it's on uh shirts are not actually (43:22 - 43:27)
available we already know the design and (43:25 - 43:29)
prices uh obviously article will be (43:27 - 43:31)
linked to the show notes like always uh (43:29 - 43:34)
there are four different designs for (43:31 - 43:37)
adults and five for kids Uniqlo will (43:34 - 43:39)
stick to the classic Pokemon Masters ex (43:37 - 43:43)
collaboration characters including red (43:39 - 43:47)
Pikachu and Eevee and then they have the (43:43 - 43:48)
shirts (43:47 - 43:50)
apparently they did a collaboration with (43:48 - 43:52)
the Super Mario Brothers movie Attack on (43:50 - 43:54)
Titan Splatoon 3 (43:52 - 43:55)
uh yeah Uniqlo does a bunch of (43:54 - 43:57)
collaborations they've done Pokemon (43:55 - 44:01)
before at least once I think twice (43:57 - 44:01)
uh they're they're they're okay shirts (44:02 - 44:08)
I'm in Florida I got the Spy x uh the (44:05 - 44:10)
spyx family shirt because they had a (44:08 - 44:12)
whole thing with them too (44:10 - 44:14)
these shirts are better in that it's at (44:12 - 44:16)
least the Pokemon Masters art that (44:14 - 44:17)
they've just taken and pasted onto the (44:16 - 44:19)
shirts instead of being the official (44:17 - 44:21)
normal main Series games artwork that (44:19 - 44:23)
they're just taking and pasting onto the (44:21 - 44:28)
shirts I purchased that Adidas Blastoise (44:23 - 44:30)
shirt which is just like let me just (44:28 - 44:32)
take the Ken tsukumori art and slap it (44:30 - 44:35)
right on and then next to it to be a (44:32 - 44:38)
full disclosure I did I did get gifted a (44:35 - 44:41)
25 gift card from the Pokemon company so (44:38 - 44:42)
I was like ah okay I'll get it I'll get (44:41 - 44:46)
the hoodie uh no neither Pokemon nor (44:42 - 44:49)
Adidas made me feel validated in that (44:46 - 44:51)
purchase it was just like (44:49 - 44:54)
not uh not a great hoodie like just (44:51 - 44:56)
didn't fit really well wasn't like super (44:54 - 45:00)
soft just an expensive one is that 2022 (44:56 - 45:01)
or earlier (45:00 - 45:05)
that was last fall I purchased that yeah (45:01 - 45:06)
because I think that Adidas that whole (45:05 - 45:08)
Adidas collection came out in what like (45:06 - 45:10)
September or October the shoes the shoe (45:08 - 45:12)
sold out shoes sold out (45:10 - 45:14)
blink of an eye but they did like (45:12 - 45:16)
sweatpants they did hoodies I think they (45:14 - 45:17)
did shirts (45:16 - 45:20)
um I still only slightly regret when we (45:17 - 45:21)
were at the mall America that I didn't (45:20 - 45:24)
buy those Pokemon pants the Levi's yeah (45:21 - 45:27)
yeah but every time I think about it I (45:24 - 45:29)
remember I really didn't like them (45:27 - 45:33)
like like I remember looking at them and (45:29 - 45:35)
going the Levi's collection had those (45:33 - 45:38)
green collage like pants right yeah yeah (45:35 - 45:41)
yeah I really wanted those those are all (45:38 - 45:42)
too expensive for me the only thing that (45:41 - 45:43)
changed my remember that the last time (45:42 - 45:45)
at the mall America that was a guy that (45:43 - 45:46)
was in head to toe that Levi collection (45:45 - 45:48)
that was the first time I thought (45:46 - 45:50)
okay (45:48 - 45:53)
I could see it (45:50 - 45:55)
yeah he looks pretty good honestly I (45:53 - 45:57)
mean he wore it was confidence let's say (45:55 - 45:59)
that (45:57 - 45:59)
yeah there hasn't been a lot of you know (46:00 - 46:03)
where what may there hasn't really been (46:01 - 46:06)
a lot of collaborations this year (46:03 - 46:07)
um (46:06 - 46:10)
uh the only one from this Uniqlo that I (46:07 - 46:12)
like I think is the black and white one (46:10 - 46:14)
with the villains on the back yeah with (46:12 - 46:15)
the villains the villains the two ones (46:14 - 46:17)
aren't bad either (46:15 - 46:19)
the yellow kids Pikachu shirt is pretty (46:17 - 46:23)
good yeah I mean I do like the blue (46:19 - 46:26)
Leon Cynthia it's it's about to go down (46:23 - 46:27)
shirt I think (46:26 - 46:30)
the design is nice on that but the blue (46:27 - 46:33)
is too bright I think it's hard to see (46:30 - 46:35)
that it's hard to see the design yeah (46:33 - 46:38)
that that is the point people have to (46:35 - 46:41)
get close and then the battle is on like (46:38 - 46:43)
if it's across the way and they can see (46:41 - 46:44)
it you're not gonna lock eyes you're not (46:43 - 46:46)
gonna shake them down for money or (46:44 - 46:48)
luxury balls but when they get close (46:46 - 46:51)
you're in now I don't know if I like you (46:48 - 46:52)
to close clothing I feel like their (46:51 - 46:54)
clothing is very boxy (46:52 - 46:56)
I like that's the look they're going for (46:54 - 46:59)
for sure it's definitely a style yeah I (46:56 - 47:01)
don't know (46:59 - 47:02)
it is (47:01 - 47:07)
a signature androgyny that works (47:02 - 47:09)
at a lot of bodies I think it works with (47:07 - 47:11)
all the people they picked here like I (47:09 - 47:13)
think it looks great on these people in (47:11 - 47:15)
these photos on some people it (47:13 - 47:16)
definitely doesn't work on all people (47:15 - 47:17)
right I don't think any close quotes (47:16 - 47:20)
don't work on me yeah I think I I don't (47:17 - 47:22)
think I look good in boxy I like a very (47:20 - 47:24)
fitted (47:22 - 47:26)
very fitted look yeah I mean you're a (47:24 - 47:28)
slip of a thing like I don't know I got (47:26 - 47:29)
on the scale the other day Greg and I (47:28 - 47:31)
was like oh this is the heaviest I've (47:29 - 47:34)
ever been I really really destroyed my (47:31 - 47:38)
confidence level honestly okay (47:34 - 47:43)
you're 98 pounds in wet clothing like (47:38 - 47:43)
I don't know Greg I'm getting old maybe (47:43 - 47:46)
my Vitality (47:45 - 47:50)
I warned you I have warned you about (47:46 - 47:53)
this very thing (47:50 - 47:56)
when you couldn't eat (47:53 - 47:59)
fast food without your insides revolting (47:56 - 48:02)
I warned you then your metabolism is (47:59 - 48:03)
going to come back so now you have to (48:02 - 48:05)
come with me to the gym and Get Swole (48:03 - 48:07)
okay (48:05 - 48:10)
I'll teach you a few things (48:07 - 48:12)
I feel like I feel like I would I I (48:10 - 48:14)
could do okay on a treadmill (48:12 - 48:17)
do you don't go (48:14 - 48:17)
what is our uh where's our news what's (48:21 - 48:27)
our next article here (48:23 - 48:27)
oh the history and snow stuff (48:27 - 48:32)
um (48:31 - 48:34)
uh Hannah was the one that dropped us in (48:32 - 48:37)
our do you want to talk about it (48:34 - 48:39)
uh if I can get it open so his sui and (48:37 - 48:43)
snow won uh I mean it seemed pretty big (48:39 - 48:47)
award the Webby Awards winner for the (48:43 - 48:49)
animation category (48:47 - 48:52)
and so this was a short series of videos (48:49 - 48:54)
that they put out on YouTube that was I (48:52 - 48:57)
think three uh less than 10 minute (48:54 - 48:59)
episodes so the whole thing all together (48:57 - 49:01)
is less than 30 minutes (48:59 - 49:05)
um about a little kid in Hisui and a (49:01 - 49:08)
Hisui and Zorua and it's a very cute (49:05 - 49:11)
very cool little well animated beautiful (49:08 - 49:15)
short and it won mm-hmm (49:11 - 49:18)
oh and a Webby yeah (49:15 - 49:20)
which (49:18 - 49:24)
all the trophy names are poorly named (49:20 - 49:26)
so the the really cool thing about (49:24 - 49:28)
hisuian snow is that you can tell at (49:26 - 49:31)
which point in time it happens related (49:28 - 49:33)
to the games because the space-time (49:31 - 49:35)
distortions have already started (49:33 - 49:37)
appearing so you know that it's near to (49:35 - 49:40)
the time when Legends takes place but (49:37 - 49:42)
you also know that it's before when (49:40 - 49:45)
Legends takes place because uh Captain (49:42 - 49:49)
silaine is still part of the not (49:45 - 49:52)
where the different cores names (49:49 - 49:56)
oh shoot I think she's still part of the (49:52 - 49:57)
security core (49:56 - 49:59)
yeah I'm pretty sure the red ones yeah (49:57 - 50:00)
yeah (49:59 - 50:02)
and so that's before she starts her own (50:00 - 50:05)
and is in charge of the one that you are (50:02 - 50:08)
in when you're part of (50:05 - 50:10)
the town (50:08 - 50:12)
so you can tell that this takes place (50:10 - 50:14)
right before the game start that this (50:12 - 50:16)
little kid (50:14 - 50:19)
or that the events of this series are (50:16 - 50:21)
quite possibly one of the main reasons (50:19 - 50:24)
people in the village start (50:21 - 50:27)
befriending Pokemon (50:24 - 50:27)
that this this short is kind of the (50:28 - 50:34)
Catalyst for people in the village even (50:31 - 50:38)
kind of trusting Pokemon yeah (50:34 - 50:40)
it was really done it's a very beautiful (50:38 - 50:42)
animated (50:40 - 50:44)
short (50:42 - 50:47)
I never ended up watching it I was (50:44 - 50:50)
waiting for all three to come out and (50:47 - 50:55)
then yeah hey spoiler all three are out (50:50 - 50:55)
I didn't watch it until last weekend so (50:58 - 51:02)
that's fair (51:01 - 51:03)
yeah I can't remember what happened (51:02 - 51:05)
where like something tell him I had a (51:03 - 51:09)
podcast with two non-fans (51:05 - 51:10)
I was also waiting for them all to come (51:09 - 51:12)
out I thought there would be more than (51:10 - 51:13)
three and then I lost track of it and (51:12 - 51:15)
then it won an awards so I figured I (51:13 - 51:18)
should probably finally watch this thing (51:15 - 51:20)
yeah (51:18 - 51:22)
it's just free on YouTube (51:20 - 51:25)
this reminds me that that uh Netflix (51:22 - 51:26)
thing is supposed to come out with the (51:25 - 51:29)
Psyduck that they showed at before yeah (51:26 - 51:33)
yeah the was that like Pokemon oh yeah (51:29 - 51:36)
concierge I just say Paradise I don't (51:33 - 51:37)
know they're on a beach they're on a (51:36 - 51:38)
beach (51:37 - 51:40)
foreign (51:38 - 51:40)
akes (51:41 - 51:44)
[Music] (51:45 - 51:48)
confirmed remakes confirmed me out let (51:48 - 51:52)
me pick up those beans off that Pokey (51:50 - 51:54)
pelago that was the best part (51:52 - 51:56)
ah the best part was the spa the egg (51:54 - 51:58)
hatching spot baby and I missed the egg (51:56 - 52:00)
hatching spot that was so good we're (51:58 - 52:04)
back at the bad days now yeah now we're (52:00 - 52:08)
just fighting to get decent frame rate (52:04 - 52:08)
um I it it is we are recording this on (52:09 - 52:15)
Sunday like always two o'clock right now (52:12 - 52:17)
um they normally announce new raids at (52:15 - 52:21)
uh seven seven central time so you know (52:17 - 52:23)
if this podcast goes up and you're like (52:21 - 52:25)
why didn't you talk about the Mega (52:23 - 52:26)
Mewtwo raid coming (52:25 - 52:27)
um (52:26 - 52:30)
because we're already recorded uh (52:27 - 52:33)
although Legend of Zelda uh tears of the (52:30 - 52:36)
kingdom comes out this weekend (52:33 - 52:38)
so (52:36 - 52:40)
I wonder what the overlap of Zelda and (52:38 - 52:42)
Pokemon players are a true story (52:40 - 52:44)
somebody (52:42 - 52:46)
put up a (52:44 - 52:49)
t-o-t-k which is the abbreviation leaks (52:46 - 52:51)
but my brain read that as Tick Tock (52:49 - 52:52)
leaks and I'm like what is leaking about (52:51 - 52:55)
tick tock tick tock leaks are coming I (52:52 - 52:57)
can't even hear about this like is there (52:55 - 53:00)
something juicy is did some create Tick (52:57 - 53:01)
Tock Creator leaked something and then (53:00 - 53:03)
they were like oh it's Zelda I was like (53:01 - 53:05)
well I'm out that's (53:03 - 53:09)
not interesting the Reggie Drago makeup (53:05 - 53:12)
raids are also this weekend hopefully (53:09 - 53:16)
they'll go smoothly this time (53:12 - 53:16)
they won't (53:16 - 53:20)
uh yeah you know I think if you're in a (53:18 - 53:23)
specific time zone New Zealand slash a (53:20 - 53:25)
couple hours after that you you'll get (53:23 - 53:27)
like a couple free raid passes (53:25 - 53:29)
I think that's right that's what they (53:27 - 53:30)
said (53:29 - 53:32)
uh but yeah tears of the kingdom comes (53:30 - 53:35)
out this weekend I I don't for I know (53:32 - 53:36)
there were some people that are like (53:35 - 53:37)
there's no way Pokemon would do an event (53:36 - 53:39)
the same weekend as tears of the Kingdom (53:37 - 53:40)
I want to remind people that the Pokemon (53:39 - 53:43)
company released a brand new game and (53:40 - 53:46)
also had the uh European International (53:43 - 53:49)
championships for the old game on the (53:46 - 53:52)
same weekend that happened and on top of (53:49 - 53:54)
that there was also commute day all on (53:52 - 53:55)
the same weekend I would like to point (53:54 - 53:58)
you to August if I remember this very (53:55 - 54:00)
year if you think they're good at (53:58 - 54:02)
scheduling I would like to point you at (54:00 - 54:04)
the month of August if if I remember (54:02 - 54:06)
correctly (54:04 - 54:08)
Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire came out (54:06 - 54:10)
the same exact day as a Super Smash (54:08 - 54:12)
Brothers game (54:10 - 54:14)
I don't remember which one it was it was (54:12 - 54:17)
the Wii U one I think which should be (54:14 - 54:19)
fair no one owned a Wii U so maybe that (54:17 - 54:21)
was the right play (54:19 - 54:23)
um I owned a Wii U (54:21 - 54:25)
H I did too and then somebody stole it (54:23 - 54:29)
uh so I I don't think just because Zelda (54:25 - 54:30)
is coming out this weekend they're gonna (54:29 - 54:31)
skip (54:30 - 54:34)
a raid weekend especially since we have (54:31 - 54:39)
had four back to back down right it was (54:34 - 54:39)
decidueye Samurai Typhlosion intellion (54:40 - 54:47)
there was no weeks in between (54:44 - 54:47)
[Music] (54:47 - 54:48)
um (54:47 - 54:51)
for that there are three we talked about (54:48 - 54:53)
this last week there are three starters (54:51 - 54:58)
left technically so if one two (54:53 - 55:02)
uh I I mean if they were to do the last (54:58 - 55:05)
three that's six more weeks of raids and (55:02 - 55:08)
that would be around the time where (55:05 - 55:11)
summer is starting and spring is ending (55:08 - 55:14)
and Pokemon home maybe (55:11 - 55:14)
I don't know I don't know what they're I (55:14 - 55:18)
don't know what their Pokemon home plan (55:16 - 55:20)
is uh but (55:18 - 55:22)
if it's we need to pump out the rest of (55:20 - 55:23)
these starter raids before we connect (55:22 - 55:25)
Maybe (55:23 - 55:27)
it kind of lines up a little bit it kind (55:25 - 55:30)
of makes sense (55:27 - 55:30)
um I I don't I don't know I'm kind of (55:32 - 55:37)
hoping they eventually repeat (55:35 - 55:39)
um just for the people who missed them (55:37 - 55:43)
oh they will if this company thrives on (55:39 - 55:45)
repeats (55:43 - 55:45)
that's why we're getting ready Drago (55:46 - 55:51)
again they love their teeth they love (55:49 - 55:54)
that I mean look we're gonna get 15 (55:51 - 55:57)
Mewtwo raids so (55:54 - 55:57)
um yeah and then the as of this (55:58 - 56:01)
recording the global Challenge three is (55:59 - 56:03)
ending (56:01 - 56:05)
uh who knows if there's a global (56:03 - 56:08)
challenge for (56:05 - 56:10)
I I don't know I mean we're out of (56:08 - 56:13)
potential ball backpacks if you follow (56:10 - 56:14)
the ball guy shirt (56:13 - 56:16)
it's true yeah if we're basing off the (56:14 - 56:18)
ball guy shirt there's nothing after an (56:16 - 56:19)
Ultra Ball they stopped they only made (56:18 - 56:20)
three (56:19 - 56:22)
nothing else after that I think I (56:20 - 56:25)
misspoke two weeks ago I think I said (56:22 - 56:30)
the new VGC season starts on June 1st (56:25 - 56:33)
um it actually ends on June 30th so (56:30 - 56:35)
technically July 1st would be a new that (56:33 - 56:38)
would be the regulation D or whatever we (56:35 - 56:40)
were talking about (56:38 - 56:41)
um (56:40 - 56:48)
if that's the case so the (56:41 - 56:51)
International championships for the NAIC (56:48 - 56:55)
is going to be June 29th 30th (56:51 - 56:59)
and then regulation D ideally starts on (56:55 - 57:02)
July 1st which would then (56:59 - 57:04)
take us two worlds but that's only about (57:02 - 57:07)
a month of that regulation (57:04 - 57:11)
so I don't know if (57:07 - 57:11)
that would be the final regulation for (57:11 - 57:18)
worlds or if it's C and I I did suggest (57:14 - 57:21)
or think that like oh hasuian Pokemon (57:18 - 57:23)
would be the next but I guess they could (57:21 - 57:25)
technically do (57:23 - 57:29)
you're allowed meridon or Corydon but (57:25 - 57:30)
not both (57:29 - 57:32)
and that would be the final regulation (57:30 - 57:36)
before hisuian Pokemon (57:32 - 57:38)
um which I I guess kind of makes sense (57:36 - 57:40)
because that's kind of how sun and moon (57:38 - 57:42)
slash ultrason and moon were but like (57:40 - 57:44)
sword and shield got so messed up (57:42 - 57:47)
because there was no world (57:44 - 57:49)
so I don't I don't know what the I don't (57:47 - 57:51)
know if regulation c will be the final (57:49 - 57:53)
one for worlds or if they're gonna do a (57:51 - 57:55)
month and a half of Regulation D for (57:53 - 57:58)
worlds and if it is regulation D and (57:55 - 58:00)
it's not hisuian Pokemon then it would (57:58 - 58:01)
just be (58:00 - 58:03)
you're allowed to use my ride on coridon (58:01 - 58:05)
but only one of them (58:03 - 58:07)
and that would complete all 400 Pokemon (58:05 - 58:10)
in the Pokedex (58:07 - 58:10)
but (58:10 - 58:13)
um (58:12 - 58:18)
that seems scary I get to feel like (58:13 - 58:20)
here's the last regulate there's like no (58:18 - 58:22)
tournaments anymore (58:20 - 58:23)
um (58:22 - 58:24)
but they can also say like okay (58:23 - 58:27)
regulation D is starting this will run (58:24 - 58:28)
for three months like every other (58:27 - 58:30)
regulation but (58:28 - 58:33)
worlds will be regulation C which makes (58:30 - 58:35)
it just weird that like (58:33 - 58:38)
people going to Worlds aren't going to (58:35 - 58:40)
even bother with regulation D until yeah (58:38 - 58:43)
