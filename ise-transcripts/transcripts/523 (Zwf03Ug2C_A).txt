turned around and looked at a microscope (1:39 - 1:42)
yeah (1:41 - 1:45)

now you are on punishment for your (1:46 - 1:51)
complete (1:49 - 1:53)
failure (1:51 - 1:54)
when a knitter (1:53 - 1:57)
asks another knitter what's on your (1:54 - 2:01)
needles it means what are you knitting (1:57 - 2:03)
right now i am knitting a and i'll bring (2:01 - 2:06)

you've dipped it in formaldehyde you (2:09 - 2:14)
monster you must (2:12 - 2:18)
you have to you have to clarify um (2:14 - 2:18)

little mock cable (2:42 - 2:46)
yeah i'll bring it after the break (2:43 - 2:49)
so that you and the (2:46 - 2:52)
non-audience (2:49 - 2:52)
to the (2:53 - 2:57)
dearth of pokemon news available this (2:54 - 2:59)
week i was going to have us do an entire (2:57 - 3:01)
segment on pokemon crafts (2:59 - 3:04)
and then i said (3:01 - 3:06)
no we'd need somebody like pangumon who (3:04 - 3:09)
actually does pokemon actual crafts i (3:06 - 3:11)
mean there's actual crafters out there i (3:09 - 3:14)
did so one of the first i i started with (3:11 - 3:16)
cross stitching that was like my first (3:14 - 3:18)
crafting (3:16 - 3:19)
thing well i guess i tried to start with (3:18 - 3:21)
crochet and i was making amigurumi but (3:19 - 3:24)
it was terrible so um then i went to (3:21 - 3:27)
cross stitch and i have cross stitched a (3:24 - 3:29)
squirtle (3:27 - 3:32)
i'm really good at amagurumi i've never (3:29 - 3:35)
i'm a guru made a pokemon amigurumi (3:32 - 3:38)
i have a cross stitch question (3:35 - 3:40)
i have a cross stitch answer when you (3:38 - 3:42)
are complete with your cross stitch what (3:40 - 3:44)
do you do with it (3:42 - 3:47)
um so you can you like wash them (3:44 - 3:49)
and then you can frame them and give (3:47 - 3:51)
them away i actually have i can bring (3:49 - 3:52)
back (3:51 - 3:54)
after the break (3:52 - 3:56)
i finished i recently finished a zelda (3:54 - 3:59)
cross stitch um and i'm just literally (3:56 - 4:00)
gonna give it to one of my friends (3:59 - 4:02)
because i (4:00 - 4:04)
i have yet to craft anything for myself (4:02 - 4:08)
that i want to keep it's all just things (4:04 - 4:10)
things i find i'm like oh this would be (4:08 - 4:12)
a really cool thing to to craft and then (4:10 - 4:14)
i do it and i'm like i don't want this (4:12 - 4:16)
your friend here's the garbage i don't (4:14 - 4:18)
want but you'll want it and love it but (4:16 - 4:21)
you can't sell it either because if i (4:18 - 4:22)
were to try and solve that cross stitch (4:21 - 4:25)
i probably it probably took me 400 hours (4:22 - 4:28)
what am i going to sell it for like 2 (4:25 - 4:30)
000. no no yeah the problem is people (4:28 - 4:33)
don't value handcrafted items right at (4:30 - 4:35)
the amount of time it takes to make them (4:33 - 4:37)
that's one of the conundrums of the etsy (4:35 - 4:39)
store but yeah (4:37 - 4:42)
cross stitch is typically made on eight (4:39 - 4:44)
what's called ada cloth (4:42 - 4:45)
which (4:44 - 4:48)
you can also sew onto like like a lot of (4:45 - 4:50)
people will cross stitch onto a pillow (4:48 - 4:53)
or make it into a yeah which i have done (4:50 - 4:55)
before i can't i could use a pillow my (4:53 - 4:57)
dog would eat the pillow but i would i (4:55 - 4:59)
would i would happily take a cross (4:57 - 5:01)
stitch pillow that would have to sit on (4:59 - 5:03)
a high shelf because the threads (5:01 - 5:05)
they like to pull (5:03 - 5:09)
um and the the pinnacle if you can do it (5:05 - 5:11)
there is a version of crochet called (5:09 - 5:14)
tunisian crochet that basically makes (5:11 - 5:15)
ada cloth (5:14 - 5:17)
and then you can cross stitch you you (5:15 - 5:20)
basically crossed it you crochet your (5:17 - 5:22)
background and then cross stitch (5:20 - 5:25)
on top of it which is what i did (5:22 - 5:27)
10 years ago (5:25 - 5:30)
and i made a uh (5:27 - 5:31)
uh (5:30 - 5:33)
cyndaquil (5:31 - 5:36)
that's really cool out of yarn i could (5:33 - 5:37)
never (5:36 - 5:39)
um that would be really cool though (5:37 - 5:42)
because then you could have so ida ada (5:39 - 5:43)
however you want to pronounce it (5:42 - 5:45)
normally comes in (5:43 - 5:47)
like really boring colors so like it's (5:45 - 5:50)
always just like this tan or (5:47 - 5:52)
white so if you made it you made your (5:50 - 5:54)
own (5:52 - 5:57)
pretty cool cool colors what i did (5:54 - 6:00)
was i made (5:57 - 6:04)
uh the body of the cyndaquil (6:00 - 6:07)
uh as the as part of the ada cloth (6:04 - 6:10)
and then i cross stitched the flames (6:07 - 6:13)
so they can't see do you have a photo of (6:10 - 6:16)
this surely (6:13 - 6:19)
sure into the show notes (6:16 - 6:21)
no um that's not gonna happen are you (6:19 - 6:23)
all right (6:21 - 6:26)
let us talk about some pokemon (6:23 - 6:29)
news in this week that has had (6:26 - 6:33)
not the most pokemon news yeah but we (6:29 - 6:34)
can start there's already drama though (6:33 - 6:36)
isn't there yeah um (6:34 - 6:38)
we had (6:36 - 6:40)
uh last week we started talking about (6:38 - 6:43)
the one year anniversary of pokemon (6:40 - 6:47)
unite which for people who are (6:43 - 6:50)
fresh into this universe uh pokemon (6:47 - 6:52)
unite is the (6:50 - 6:54)
uh moba boba for the pokemon moba that (6:52 - 6:56)
you can play on (6:54 - 7:00)
uh ios android or switch (6:56 - 7:02)
i think it's most popular on switch uh (7:00 - 7:05)
but it has been around for one year one (7:02 - 7:08)
year what's funny to me is (7:05 - 7:12)
uh one year is in this world 365 days (7:08 - 7:14)
and when i open up pokemon unite every (7:12 - 7:16)
single time it says you haven't played (7:14 - 7:20)
this game for 197 days and i'm like (7:16 - 7:22)
that's right for the majority of this (7:20 - 7:23)
year (7:22 - 7:26)
i realized i didn't like you and i (7:23 - 7:28)
walked away (7:26 - 7:29)
so greg tell me (7:28 - 7:31)
your feelings about the one year (7:29 - 7:34)
anniversary of pokemon unite the wedding (7:31 - 7:37)
anniversary is really fun so far uh the (7:34 - 7:39)
new (7:37 - 7:43)
the new bosch boss rush mode i almost (7:39 - 7:45)
accidentally played that yes (7:43 - 7:46)
oh yes (7:45 - 7:48)
it's (7:46 - 7:51)
interesting in the fact that (7:48 - 7:54)
they clearly pulled from mmo raid (7:51 - 7:56)
mechanics (7:54 - 7:59)
so i play a lot of finance 2014 (7:56 - 8:01)
and there are very specific (7:59 - 8:04)
tells that when a boss does a particular (8:01 - 8:06)
attack like a certain pattern will light (8:04 - 8:08)
up on the floor or a certain pattern (8:06 - 8:11)
will show up around you the bosses in (8:08 - 8:14)
this do those exact same things (8:11 - 8:15)
so the first time i went in i was like (8:14 - 8:18)
oh i instinctually know what all this is (8:15 - 8:19)
okay i know how to get out i know to go (8:18 - 8:21)
here i have to go here because it is (8:19 - 8:22)
very (8:21 - 8:24)
uh (8:22 - 8:25)
mmo (8:24 - 8:27)
dungeon like (8:25 - 8:30)
in its execution um (8:27 - 8:32)
it needs to be (8:30 - 8:34)
enhanced (8:32 - 8:36)
somehow it is literally just (8:34 - 8:38)
one (8:36 - 8:39)
arena (8:38 - 8:42)
there's no change you run into it (8:39 - 8:45)
uh the first boss is there you defeat (8:42 - 8:46)
the first boss and then the other one (8:45 - 8:48)
just spawns in where it was so like the (8:46 - 8:51)
scenery doesn't change you don't move (8:48 - 8:52)
anywhere (8:51 - 8:55)
you just stay in one circle (8:52 - 8:57)
so it's on next year's lair (8:55 - 8:58)
yeah (8:57 - 9:00)
with three (8:58 - 9:03)
three separate bosses popping in (9:00 - 9:06)
for no uh the other issue that i think (9:03 - 9:10)
exists is they have defenders you have (9:06 - 9:14)
healers as things in the game play like (9:10 - 9:16)
there's ones that focus on support and (9:14 - 9:18)
there's ones that focus on defense they (9:16 - 9:21)
are useless right now in (9:18 - 9:24)
boss rush because (9:21 - 9:24)
because of the time limit on the higher (9:24 - 9:30)
levels if everybody isn't doing maximum (9:27 - 9:31)
damage (9:30 - 9:33)
it's almost (9:31 - 9:36)
it's really hard to (9:33 - 9:38)
defeat the boss and (9:36 - 9:40)
when you are knocked out it's just like (9:38 - 9:41)
you're knocked out in the game you go (9:40 - 9:43)
back and there's a timer (9:41 - 9:46)
uh until you go back in (9:43 - 9:47)
and (9:46 - 9:50)
i generally play healer and i couldn't (9:47 - 9:53)
see the benefit of me (9:50 - 9:55)
keeping people a little (9:53 - 9:57)
alive a little bit longer to get two (9:55 - 9:59)
seconds out (9:57 - 10:01)
of them staying in before they would (9:59 - 10:02)
have to respawn (10:01 - 10:05)
than me not doing that amount of damage (10:02 - 10:07)
uh it just (10:05 - 10:10)
the heels are too small for that for the (10:07 - 10:12)
amount of damage that that boss does (10:10 - 10:14)
does that is sure that it that it i am (10:12 - 10:16)
better off (10:14 - 10:19)
just pure just doing pure damage and (10:16 - 10:21)
everybody is better off just doing pure (10:19 - 10:22)
damage (10:21 - 10:24)
um so i think that is (10:22 - 10:26)
a drawback to that it's limited so like (10:24 - 10:28)
it's going to go away in a week and it's (10:26 - 10:29)
just going to come back at random times (10:28 - 10:33)
so i it's a fun diversion it's also a (10:29 - 10:35)
fun thing where you aren't fighting (10:33 - 10:37)
another group of people so if you just (10:35 - 10:38)
want to do something casual that you're (10:37 - 10:40)
all working together on (10:38 - 10:43)
it's fun you can try other (10:40 - 10:45)
uh (10:43 - 10:47)
pokemon see if you like them but really (10:45 - 10:49)
you just want to go with damage because (10:47 - 10:50)
nothing else (10:49 - 10:52)
nothing else matters (10:50 - 10:54)
uh they added in (10:52 - 10:57)
what i think is going to be potentially (10:54 - 10:58)
game breaking (10:57 - 11:00)
uh it feels that way right now until (10:58 - 11:02)
they do some bounce which is they added (11:00 - 11:05)
in the new emblem system yeah what is (11:02 - 11:07)
that because i didn't notice that when (11:05 - 11:08)
i've logged in and tried to clear out (11:07 - 11:11)
all my red dots so (11:08 - 11:14)
energy tank used to get you tickets and (11:11 - 11:17)
clothing items only yeah so when you got (11:14 - 11:19)
100 energy you'd turn them in and you (11:17 - 11:21)
would get (11:19 - 11:22)
a shirt (11:21 - 11:23)
or (11:22 - 11:26)
some coupons or some coins (11:23 - 11:28)
uh and after a year in the game (11:26 - 11:30)
everybody's like i've gotten all of the (11:28 - 11:32)
shirts out of this i i need nothing else (11:30 - 11:34)
out of here and i already got other (11:32 - 11:36)
grits so they added the emblem system (11:34 - 11:39)
and the emblem system are little coins (11:36 - 11:41)
with pokemon on them (11:39 - 11:44)
but the thing that's somewhat game (11:41 - 11:45)
breaking is (11:44 - 11:50)
they have stat boosts on them (11:45 - 11:50)
so (11:50 - 11:52)
they (11:50 - 11:55)
like your they boost your attack they (11:52 - 11:57)
boost your defense correct (11:55 - 11:59)
do you attach them to a pokemon how do (11:57 - 12:01)
they work so what happens is there's a (11:59 - 12:02)
screen (12:01 - 12:04)
that is called the (12:02 - 12:07)
loadout screen i believe and you can get (12:04 - 12:09)
three custom loadouts (12:07 - 12:13)
and what you do is you can put up to 10 (12:09 - 12:14)
coins in them (12:13 - 12:17)
and depending on what you put in that (12:14 - 12:20)
will change your (12:17 - 12:21)
stats (12:20 - 12:23)
but the interesting thing is is the (12:21 - 12:26)
coins themselves don't matter in so much (12:23 - 12:29)
as the color that they represent (12:26 - 12:30)
so like (12:29 - 12:33)
bulbasaur is green (12:30 - 12:37)
and if you get six green coins in your (12:33 - 12:41)
layout it will boost your special attack (12:37 - 12:43)
by four percent (12:41 - 12:44)
okay (12:43 - 12:47)
so the more of a particular color you (12:44 - 12:50)
have the more it will boost (12:47 - 12:54)
that the thing that it's aligned with so (12:50 - 12:56)
green is special attack yellow is (12:54 - 12:58)
movement speed when you're not in combat (12:56 - 13:01)
red is just your base attack speed not (12:58 - 13:04)
power but speed blue is your defenses (13:01 - 13:08)
white is your hit points orange is (13:04 - 13:11)
attack purple is special defense (13:08 - 13:14)
uh pink is how quickly you get out of (13:11 - 13:15)
hindrances (13:14 - 13:17)
but the one that is potentially game (13:15 - 13:19)
breaking that everybody wants (13:17 - 13:24)
is black is move cooldown reduction (13:19 - 13:28)
so you can get a eight percent (13:24 - 13:30)
move cool down reduction (13:28 - 13:32)
on your moves (13:30 - 13:35)
which means the problem of venusaur in (13:32 - 13:37)
petal dance which is already a huge (13:35 - 13:39)
problem so (13:37 - 13:41)
when you put up paladins it attacks (13:39 - 13:44)
everything around you but also venusaur (13:41 - 13:45)
runs (13:44 - 13:47)
and it used to be that it would end and (13:45 - 13:49)
there would be a three second delay (13:47 - 13:51)
before they could fire it again (13:49 - 13:53)
i've seen a person that has an eight (13:51 - 13:55)
percent (13:53 - 13:56)
has all black so getting an eight (13:55 - 13:58)
percent move cool down and just has it (13:56 - 14:01)
up constantly so this is running (13:58 - 14:03)
constantly going pedal dance is going (14:01 - 14:04)
and (14:03 - 14:08)
venusaur is restoring its ability to (14:04 - 14:10)
do that use that move again while it's (14:08 - 14:12)
still going so that it runs keep (14:10 - 14:15)
perpetual pedal dance going (14:12 - 14:18)
and they just cruise around so (14:15 - 14:21)
i like the system overall like it is (14:18 - 14:23)
good to have (14:21 - 14:27)
this level of customization but the (14:23 - 14:30)
none of the current existing characters (14:27 - 14:33)
were balanced for this in mind (14:30 - 14:35)
and i don't know (14:33 - 14:37)
what is going to be easier to balance (14:35 - 14:40)
the emblems or the pokemon themselves (14:37 - 14:42)
um there's a couple of things to also be (14:40 - 14:45)
aware about with the loadout screen (14:42 - 14:47)
is you can build three loadouts like you (14:45 - 14:49)
can say like this is mine this is (14:47 - 14:51)
starting to sound so monster hunter it's (14:49 - 14:53)
like you prep like different loadouts (14:51 - 14:55)
for different type of monsters you're (14:53 - 14:56)
going after and it's like that's part of (14:55 - 14:59)
getting ready for the hunt and like you (14:56 - 15:00)
can have three but if you don't pay (14:59 - 15:02)
attention and like you're using your (15:00 - 15:04)
defender loadout you can't (15:02 - 15:06)
or at least i haven't found a way yet (15:04 - 15:08)
where you can assign a loadout to a (15:06 - 15:09)
specific pokemon (15:08 - 15:12)
you have to go into your prep screen (15:09 - 15:14)
after you've picked your character to (15:12 - 15:16)
pick which loadout you're going to use (15:14 - 15:18)
because otherwise it will stay like if (15:16 - 15:20)
you put up your defender loadout then (15:18 - 15:21)
you go to attacker but you didn't change (15:20 - 15:23)
it then you're on your defender loadout (15:21 - 15:25)
which is going to hurt your attackers (15:23 - 15:27)
down yeah so so the held items are (15:25 - 15:29)
different than i mean the emblems are (15:27 - 15:31)
different from held items because they (15:29 - 15:33)
apply too much of them are their own (15:31 - 15:35)
different things (15:33 - 15:38)
it's now a combination of held items (15:35 - 15:39)
and (15:38 - 15:42)
emblems and (15:39 - 15:42)
i think they made this game really hard (15:42 - 15:47)
for themselves to balance because now (15:45 - 15:50)
they have three separate moving parts (15:47 - 15:53)
they have the pokemon stats themselves (15:50 - 15:56)
and the moves that they do they have (15:53 - 15:58)
16 i think now (15:56 - 16:01)
actual items that affect your stats (15:58 - 16:04)
and now they have (16:01 - 16:06)
all of these emblems that do different (16:04 - 16:09)
color boosting so (16:06 - 16:11)
it's great for people who want to get (16:09 - 16:14)
into the granular nitty-gritty of it but (16:11 - 16:16)
i cannot imagine trying to balance any (16:14 - 16:17)
of this (16:16 - 16:19)
we have a question yes (16:17 - 16:21)
i have a question yes what is the (16:19 - 16:24)
difference between (16:21 - 16:26)
a reduction in a moves cooldown and (16:24 - 16:28)
attack speed (16:26 - 16:30)
so a move cooldown so (16:28 - 16:33)
moves are your special moves so every (16:30 - 16:35)
pokemon has a basic attack that is just (16:33 - 16:37)
you're hitting a and it's lurching (16:35 - 16:39)
forward or it's shooting some okay it's (16:37 - 16:42)
it's usually not a very strong attack (16:39 - 16:45)
but it is what you fill in while your (16:42 - 16:46)
big moves are on cooldown so that you (16:45 - 16:49)
have like ultimates right and (16:46 - 16:52)
that is what the move cooled down (16:49 - 16:54)
deals with that and basically attack (16:52 - 16:56)
speed is how so (16:54 - 16:58)
like (16:56 - 17:01)
ralts has a really good base attack it's (16:58 - 17:03)
a ranged attack that fires pretty (17:01 - 17:05)
quickly so getting that cooled down (17:03 - 17:07)
means while you're waiting for your (17:05 - 17:10)
slower cooldowns to happen you're able (17:07 - 17:12)
to attack more and there's a few that (17:10 - 17:15)
have that sort of dynamic okay um but (17:12 - 17:17)
most most of them like you don't care (17:15 - 17:19)
about your your basic because it doesn't (17:17 - 17:22)
do a lot you know it is it is there for (17:19 - 17:24)
chipping damage (17:22 - 17:26)
waiting for your big move to reset so (17:24 - 17:28)
you can really do the damage pulse okay (17:26 - 17:30)
um with the move (17:28 - 17:32)
cool down (17:30 - 17:32)
it (17:32 - 17:35)
right now it basically is like just go (17:32 - 17:38)
move cool down because there's nothing (17:35 - 17:39)
there's not a pokemon that i can think (17:38 - 17:42)
of that doesn't benefit from getting its (17:39 - 17:45)
move it's big move faster well i mean (17:42 - 17:47)
the really bad pokemons that nobody (17:45 - 17:48)
wants to play right (17:47 - 17:50)
is that wait are you still maintaining (17:48 - 17:52)
el degas like cramer (17:50 - 17:53)
well i mean i'm still maintaining i (17:52 - 17:54)
still maintain aldegast because i'm (17:53 - 17:57)
still a healer at heart i still like (17:54 - 17:58)
doing the support role (17:57 - 18:01)
um but again i'm contemplating just (17:58 - 18:03)
going all (18:01 - 18:06)
move cold on because then i heal faster (18:03 - 18:09)
i can heal everything around me faster i (18:06 - 18:11)
can get shields up faster i can put down (18:09 - 18:12)
my (18:11 - 18:15)
path that speeds everybody up faster (18:12 - 18:17)
um (18:15 - 18:20)
there's very little like (18:17 - 18:22)
if you're a casual player like (18:20 - 18:23)
move (18:22 - 18:25)
cooldown reduction is obviously the (18:23 - 18:27)
easiest way to go because it really (18:25 - 18:30)
benefits without a whole lot of extra (18:27 - 18:31)
thought (18:30 - 18:34)
um i do think this (18:31 - 18:36)
will make the game a lot (18:34 - 18:39)
more competitive as far as like what (18:36 - 18:42)
professionals do like (18:39 - 18:43)
a pro player will know the perfect (18:42 - 18:45)
build-outs and will have done the (18:43 - 18:47)
analysis and will know how to how to (18:45 - 18:50)
align the colors perfectly like i think (18:47 - 18:52)
that's what they're going for (18:50 - 18:54)
yeah (18:52 - 18:56)
but i think for the casual player it's a (18:54 - 18:58)
little overwhelming and b like (18:56 - 19:00)
averages just probably could tell you oh (18:58 - 19:01)
just (19:00 - 19:03)
play until you get all (19:01 - 19:05)
enough you get six pokemon that (19:03 - 19:07)
represent the color black and the other (19:05 - 19:09)
color doesn't matter (19:07 - 19:10)
yeah there's really people who like (19:09 - 19:13)
really enjoy doing that algebra of (19:10 - 19:16)
stat manipulation and (19:13 - 19:18)
it's the second time we've brought up (19:16 - 19:20)
math today (19:18 - 19:24)
um i think overall like they they are (19:20 - 19:26)
incredibly generous with this (19:24 - 19:27)
anniversary (19:26 - 19:30)
uh you get free licenses (19:27 - 19:33)
uh i got snorlax for free i got (19:30 - 19:36)
blastoise for free i like if you're (19:33 - 19:38)
logging in and playing like i think for (19:36 - 19:40)
these next two weeks they're just giving (19:38 - 19:42)
you free licenses for playing (19:40 - 19:45)
are they temporary licenses or forever (19:42 - 19:46)
they are permanent you get this (19:45 - 19:47)
character (19:46 - 19:50)
like the glacion license (19:47 - 19:52)
i haven't earned enough to get that one (19:50 - 19:54)
for free (19:52 - 19:55)
um (19:54 - 19:57)
so buzzwell is coming out after the (19:55 - 19:59)
anniversary i believe it's released at (19:57 - 20:01)
the end of the anniversary um (19:59 - 20:03)
and it's not in the list of free ones (20:01 - 20:05)
you get i think right now the all the (20:03 - 20:07)
free ones you get are the ones that the (20:05 - 20:09)
game originally launched with i'd have (20:07 - 20:11)
to look at the list again but (20:09 - 20:14)
if you're interested in trying it out a (20:11 - 20:15)
there's a lot of people playing right (20:14 - 20:17)
now so there's a lot of people who are (20:15 - 20:18)
bad at the game right now (20:17 - 20:19)
um (20:18 - 20:22)
but the rewards are great you're getting (20:19 - 20:24)
a lot of free stuff (20:22 - 20:25)
um (20:24 - 20:27)
they're giving free licenses bosch russ (20:25 - 20:30)
allows you to play with characters just (20:27 - 20:31)
see if you like (20:30 - 20:34)
playing with them with a with a team (20:31 - 20:36)
where you're not being attacked all the (20:34 - 20:37)
time by (20:36 - 20:39)
by other players you're not being (20:37 - 20:42)
targeted by other players um (20:39 - 20:44)
i think overall (20:42 - 20:46)
when i look at other anniversaries that (20:44 - 20:48)
other games have done like (20:46 - 20:50)
unite came out (20:48 - 20:52)
fighting and (20:50 - 20:54)
i i i (20:52 - 20:56)
am struggling to find (20:54 - 20:58)
a fault with how they're doing this i (20:56 - 20:59)
mean you're still playing it a year (20:58 - 21:00)
later (20:59 - 21:02)
i'm still playing it a year later i mean (21:00 - 21:04)
i did take a big break like i took a (21:02 - 21:06)
two-month break because i was just like (21:04 - 21:09)
i'm exhausted i'm tired of playing pvp (21:06 - 21:12)
um they were really (21:09 - 21:15)
they were really into the daily like log (21:12 - 21:17)
in every day to get everything and then (21:15 - 21:19)
they sort of changed that philosophy (21:17 - 21:21)
so when i came back in (21:19 - 21:23)
events lasted a little longer they (21:21 - 21:25)
weren't always like (21:23 - 21:28)
log in sequentially like just log in (21:25 - 21:30)
five times during this two-week period (21:28 - 21:33)
is enough to get a bunch of stuff so (21:30 - 21:35)
they sort of switched their philosophy a (21:33 - 21:37)
lot they've really (21:35 - 21:39)
ramped up the freebies they've really (21:37 - 21:41)
ramped up the ability to get you to come (21:39 - 21:43)
back playing like (21:41 - 21:45)
i honestly wish (21:43 - 21:48)
other pokemon games like go and masters (21:45 - 21:51)
really sort of took to heart (21:48 - 21:53)
what they're doing to win players back (21:51 - 21:58)
dr mathis how much unite did you play (21:53 - 21:58)
and (21:58 - 22:01)
[Music] (21:59 - 22:03)
i like the pause (22:01 - 22:05)
[Laughter] (22:03 - 22:09)
i was like do i lie i don't know no um (22:05 - 22:10)
i don't have a ton of time for video (22:09 - 22:13)
games and so the precious time i do have (22:10 - 22:15)
usually goes to (22:13 - 22:16)
farming sims that kind of play (22:15 - 22:20)
themselves farming simulators yeah um or (22:16 - 22:22)
like sims 4 i've been playing recently (22:20 - 22:25)
it's it's things that so the my problem (22:22 - 22:26)
with a lot of like newer games (22:25 - 22:30)
especially games like um unite or (22:26 - 22:31)
you know like call of duty games stuff (22:30 - 22:33)
like that it's one of those like if you (22:31 - 22:35)
don't get in right away (22:33 - 22:37)
you're it's there's a steep learning (22:35 - 22:40)
curve and people people have been (22:37 - 22:42)
playing since the beginning so they kind (22:40 - 22:43)
of like know what's going on and it (22:42 - 22:45)
makes it not very fun (22:43 - 22:47)
though i mean what greg is saying like (22:45 - 22:49)
it sounds like they're making it very (22:47 - 22:54)
very easy for new players um and the (22:49 - 22:56)
fact that it's almost kind of like when (22:54 - 22:58)
you were describing it it almost seems (22:56 - 23:00)
like world of warcraft's me like pvp and (22:58 - 23:01)
world of warcraft (23:00 - 23:05)
um oh it is very pvp it is very pvp (23:01 - 23:07)
because like like warsong gulch or (23:05 - 23:09)
something like that and i'm just i i've (23:07 - 23:12)
been jonesing for a while but again like (23:09 - 23:13)
with (23:12 - 23:14)
how (23:13 - 23:15)
you know being a graduate student i (23:14 - 23:17)
don't have a ton of time and so (23:15 - 23:20)
i can't commit to anything and so that's (23:17 - 23:23)
i like to play these games that i can (23:20 - 23:25)
dip into for an hour or two (23:23 - 23:26)
every few weeks (23:25 - 23:29)
and if i come back to it i'm not like (23:26 - 23:32)
harmed yeah um like it's not like (23:29 - 23:34)
there's no fomo because the game just (23:32 - 23:36)
waits for me well there's no artificial (23:34 - 23:38)
deadline that you have to like the you (23:36 - 23:39)
this this (23:38 - 23:41)
season is ending and you didn't play (23:39 - 23:42)
enough (23:41 - 23:44)
i mean i will say like (23:42 - 23:46)
you don't have to participate in any of (23:44 - 23:48)
the season stuff (23:46 - 23:49)
you never have to play ranked like (23:48 - 23:51)
ranked is (23:49 - 23:54)
for people who really like the game and (23:51 - 23:56)
really want to like (23:54 - 23:59)
play against other people (23:56 - 24:02)
who are at the same ish level as you (23:59 - 24:05)
because standard and casual (24:02 - 24:06)
exists (24:05 - 24:08)
in the game completely like you can go (24:06 - 24:10)
into standard and for people who play (24:08 - 24:11)
rank standard is pretty frustrating (24:10 - 24:13)
because it's a bunch of people who just (24:11 - 24:15)
who don't know the basics who are this (24:13 - 24:17)
they're running at each other right and (24:15 - 24:19)
you're like when i'm telling you to come (24:17 - 24:21)
down please come down and support me (24:19 - 24:22)
like (24:21 - 24:24)
for ranked players standard gets very (24:22 - 24:25)
frustrating because it's clear people (24:24 - 24:26)
don't know what they do but (24:25 - 24:28)
there's a ton of people who play in (24:26 - 24:30)
there and they're just having a good (24:28 - 24:31)
time (24:30 - 24:34)
um the other difficult thing about i (24:31 - 24:36)
think unite is people think oh this is (24:34 - 24:37)
pvp (24:36 - 24:40)
so it's like the vgc (24:37 - 24:41)
and they are (24:40 - 24:42)
nothing alike (24:41 - 24:44)
there is no (24:42 - 24:45)
type (24:44 - 24:47)
chart like (24:45 - 24:49)
grass isn't strong against water fire (24:47 - 24:52)
isn't strong against grass that type (24:49 - 24:55)
chart doesn't exist it is just (24:52 - 24:58)
pure damage running at each other (24:55 - 25:01)
uh like the stats exist like if you're a (24:58 - 25:02)
special attacker you kind of go after (25:01 - 25:04)
things that you know might have a bad (25:02 - 25:06)
special defense but (25:04 - 25:07)
ultimately you're not making those (25:06 - 25:09)
choices you're like oh i see there's (25:07 - 25:11)
there's that's their support pokemon i'm (25:09 - 25:13)
going straight for the support (25:11 - 25:15)
like as an ass player if i show up (25:13 - 25:18)
everybody turns to kill me (25:15 - 25:19)
well so and it's funny because they keep (25:18 - 25:22)
introducing these new games that (25:19 - 25:23)
that are basically just (25:22 - 25:26)
other games made into a pokemon game (25:23 - 25:28)
because like when you describe it like (25:26 - 25:29)
that it's me like (25:28 - 25:33)
like i've said 100 world of warcraft pvp (25:29 - 25:34)
like (25:33 - 25:35)
it's just you (25:34 - 25:38)
you you do better if you know where the (25:35 - 25:40)
strength of your own moves come from and (25:38 - 25:42)
what debuffs you can put out and like (25:40 - 25:45)
how to avoid traps that people may lay (25:42 - 25:46)
or like as an elder goss like you were (25:45 - 25:48)
saying you lay down on something that (25:46 - 25:50)
helps people run faster like knowing (25:48 - 25:52)
what buffs you can give to your buddies (25:50 - 25:54)
and yeah everyone kind of working as a (25:52 - 25:55)
team (25:54 - 25:57)
but it sounds like it would be fraught (25:55 - 25:58)
like like you're saying standard would (25:57 - 26:00)
be really frustrating because (25:58 - 26:04)
uh you have all the knowledge of like oh (26:00 - 26:06)
as a as a whatever you should do this (26:04 - 26:08)
and you should be doing this and (26:06 - 26:10)
everyone's just like running around like (26:08 - 26:11)
chickens (26:10 - 26:12)
so but i (26:11 - 26:14)
i probably will never play unite and the (26:12 - 26:16)
reason is that even just listening to (26:14 - 26:19)
you guys talk i'm already like (26:16 - 26:21)
okay here's how we do it like this is (26:19 - 26:23)
what i meant like i'm already so (26:21 - 26:25)
invested like that world of warcraft (26:23 - 26:28)
like mmo mind is already like (26:25 - 26:31)
like okay now they added pve so just (26:28 - 26:34)
like that's so natural (26:31 - 26:37)
uh the good thing i would say (26:34 - 26:40)
does well is matches (26:37 - 26:42)
matches only last 10 minutes (26:40 - 26:45)
period there's you can't go there's no (26:42 - 26:47)
overtime there's no (26:45 - 26:49)
nothing at the teddy bear but that's (26:47 - 26:50)
terrible (26:49 - 26:53)
that's terrible because what that allows (26:50 - 26:55)
is after you finish a match you look at (26:53 - 26:57)
the time and you're like i can do one (26:55 - 26:59)
more match and you do that for four (26:57 - 27:04)
hours oh yes i see that you you do that (26:59 - 27:07)
i know myself (27:04 - 27:10)
i say to my friends i will play one (27:07 - 27:12)
match with you and when that one match (27:10 - 27:15)
is over i turn it off and walk away yeah (27:12 - 27:16)
the other thing that they're doing right (27:15 - 27:19)
now as part of the anniversary is (27:16 - 27:21)
they're giving boosts if you play with (27:19 - 27:23)
friends (27:21 - 27:25)
so you get more rewards by playing with (27:23 - 27:27)
your friends so it's really encouraging (27:25 - 27:29)
people like i'm a part of a discord (27:27 - 27:31)
that's specific (27:29 - 27:33)
for like a bunch of ise folks are we're (27:31 - 27:35)
on our own discord for playing this game (27:33 - 27:36)
and (27:35 - 27:39)
the shout out comes out hey (27:36 - 27:41)
who's uh (27:39 - 27:43)
who's playing right now and then people (27:41 - 27:45)
say i'll hop in real quick (27:43 - 27:46)
and generally it's like i'll hop in i'll (27:45 - 27:48)
play three matches and then i have to go (27:46 - 27:50)
like i can give you 40 minutes (27:48 - 27:51)
and (27:50 - 27:54)
we all i think at least in our group we (27:51 - 27:56)
have a good culture of (27:54 - 27:58)
hopping when you can (27:56 - 28:00)
leave when you have to like (27:58 - 28:03)
solo is fine like you can solo the game (28:00 - 28:04)
just fine (28:03 - 28:06)
and you only have to do three matches (28:04 - 28:08)
with a friend so as long as we get three (28:06 - 28:09)
done (28:08 - 28:11)
cool and then you're on your merry way (28:09 - 28:13)
see but then when you have the squad (28:11 - 28:14)
together (28:13 - 28:15)
[Music] (28:14 - 28:17)
it's like oh i gotta keep playing no i (28:15 - 28:19)
don't like it i don't like anybody that (28:17 - 28:20)
much (28:19 - 28:22)
this is true all right we gotta we gotta (28:20 - 28:24)
move away from you night news um and you (28:22 - 28:26)
guys reminded me because now now that i (28:24 - 28:28)
brought this up and you guys both looked (28:26 - 28:29)
at me cross-eyed before we started (28:28 - 28:31)
recording (28:29 - 28:33)
i want our new york (28:31 - 28:35)
state (28:33 - 28:36)
public school (28:35 - 28:39)
listeners and viewers to (28:36 - 28:42)
confirm or deny whether math (28:39 - 28:45)
classes are still taught (28:42 - 28:46)
as (28:45 - 28:48)
sequential one sequential two and (28:46 - 28:51)
sequential three i'm gonna tell you (28:48 - 28:52)
no (28:51 - 28:54)
i don't think so i don't think that's a (28:52 - 28:56)
new york thing i think um that's the (28:54 - 28:58)
time that's a time thing no no no no (28:56 - 29:02)
because in new york uh they have a state (28:58 - 29:05)
diploma system called the regents (29:02 - 29:07)
where you can you can get a diploma from (29:05 - 29:08)
your high school that's a regular (29:07 - 29:10)
diploma then if you meet particular (29:08 - 29:13)
state criteria it's a regents diploma (29:10 - 29:14)
which is supposed to be a little higher (29:13 - 29:17)
quality okay um (29:14 - 29:19)
and you have to take sequential math to (29:17 - 29:21)
get the region's diploma and there's (29:19 - 29:24)
also standardized tests either way we (29:21 - 29:25)
have a broad reach here i'd like our new (29:24 - 29:27)
york state listeners to who have (29:25 - 29:30)
recently been through publicly (29:27 - 29:31)
kelly (29:30 - 29:33)

all right so ever since then they've (31:51 - 31:55)
been dribbling out ultra beasts as part (31:53 - 31:57)
of pokemon go yep (31:55 - 31:59)
let me read the article here (31:57 - 32:02)
during pokemon go fest seattle 2022 (31:59 - 32:04)
which is occurring right now as we are (32:02 - 32:06)
recording this program a pokemon go (32:04 - 32:09)
player stumbled across a glitch allowing (32:06 - 32:13)
them to catch an unreleased circuitry (32:09 - 32:14)
throughout the years niantic has had its (32:13 - 32:16)
fair share of glitches and bugs breaking (32:14 - 32:18)
pokemon go games are releasing (32:16 - 32:20)
odd-looking pokemon or even unreleased (32:18 - 32:23)
ones indeed it was only recently a (32:20 - 32:25)
pokemon go player happened across a blue (32:23 - 32:27)
zapdos during a raid (32:25 - 32:30)
on 23rd july 2022 some pokemon go (32:27 - 32:32)
players came across an unreleased (32:30 - 32:36)
circuitry due to a go fest seattle 2022 (32:32 - 32:38)
glitch allowing them to catch the (32:36 - 32:40)
pokemon despite it not being currently (32:38 - 32:42)
available in the mobile augmented (32:40 - 32:45)
reality game (32:42 - 32:47)
but it is possible (32:45 - 32:49)
for you to catch circuitry using is is (32:47 - 32:51)
it possible for you to catch circuitry (32:49 - 32:54)
using this same glitch the tldr answer (32:51 - 32:57)
is no this pokemon is exclusive to go (32:54 - 33:02)
fest sapporo in japan 2022. at least one (32:57 - 33:03)
trainer (33:02 - 33:04)
is known to have caught circuitry (33:03 - 33:06)
through a glitch during day two of (33:04 - 33:09)
gofest seattle as a result this bug has (33:06 - 33:12)
most likely been patched by niantic (33:09 - 33:14)
according to a tweet the pokemon go (33:12 - 33:16)
player was trying to complete the sky (33:14 - 33:19)
shaman event missions after finishing (33:16 - 33:21)
them and supposedly encountering sky (33:19 - 33:22)
shaman (33:21 - 33:24)
the player faced circuitry an electric (33:22 - 33:27)
type generation seven pokemon (33:24 - 33:29)
as we mentioned earlier this pokemon go (33:27 - 33:30)
player wasn't supposed to catch (33:29 - 33:32)
circuitry it was a glitch in the game (33:30 - 33:34)
circuitry hasn't been released in (33:32 - 33:35)
pokemon go and is (33:34 - 33:37)
established to debut during zapporo blah (33:35 - 33:40)
blah blah (33:37 - 33:40)
buzzwol is the featured (33:40 - 33:46)
pokemon for go fast seattle (33:43 - 33:49)
and ferramosa was the featured uh (33:46 - 33:53)
ultra beast for go fest berlin so this (33:49 - 33:55)
is sus because (33:53 - 33:57)
it's like (33:55 - 33:59)
only one person (33:57 - 34:01)
it appears that this happened for we (33:59 - 34:03)
haven't heard it happening for multiple (34:01 - 34:05)
people (34:03 - 34:08)
and yeah there's screenshots but (34:05 - 34:13)
those are easy enough to photoshop (34:08 - 34:13)
yeah (34:13 - 34:16)
i don't think it's mentioned in the (34:14 - 34:18)
article that you just read but um (34:16 - 34:20)
sapporo isn't until august 5th through (34:18 - 34:21)
august 7th so it's not supposed to be (34:20 - 34:23)
for two more weeks so this is like it's (34:21 - 34:25)
not like sapporo was happening (34:23 - 34:26)
concurrently and (34:25 - 34:27)
[Music] (34:26 - 34:30)
accidentally this person got a circuitry (34:27 - 34:32)
like or you can't like (34:30 - 34:34)
you know do that thing where you mess (34:32 - 34:37)
with your gps like no it's not possible (34:34 - 34:41)
it should not be in the game yet um (34:37 - 34:43)
and so yeah i only see the one guy (34:41 - 34:45)
yeah (34:43 - 34:47)
let's should we call him out (34:45 - 34:50)
no (34:47 - 34:50)
here's the thing like i'm finding this (34:50 - 34:57)
same article and they're all referring (34:54 - 35:01)
to the one person the one person right (34:57 - 35:03)
and i saw it on reddit if somebody (35:01 - 35:05)
posted it on reddit but it was just one (35:03 - 35:06)
person (35:05 - 35:08)
[Music] (35:06 - 35:10)
and i mean not nothing for nothing this (35:08 - 35:13)
one person (35:10 - 35:13)
does not have a huge following (35:14 - 35:18)
so now we can have people listen in next (35:18 - 35:22)
week (35:21 - 35:25)
when we either confirm or deny (35:22 - 35:28)
that this actually happened (35:25 - 35:31)
yeah it's weird that (35:28 - 35:34)
usually when there's a glitch like that (35:31 - 35:37)
a lot of people get the glitch (35:34 - 35:39)
yeah exactly especially the way it's (35:37 - 35:40)
described like oh (35:39 - 35:43)
i was doing the sky shaven quest line (35:40 - 35:44)
which i believe is what everybody's (35:43 - 35:46)
doing in seattle (35:44 - 35:47)
so (35:46 - 35:51)
why would only one person (35:47 - 35:51)
get the glitch because generally it's (35:51 - 35:55)
not (35:53 - 35:57)
a bug isn't like oh and one random (35:55 - 36:00)
person got like multiple people usually (35:57 - 36:01)
confirm it (36:00 - 36:03)
and i'm not seeing both i'm like i'm i (36:01 - 36:05)
am literally digging through twitter (36:03 - 36:07)
right now twitter (36:05 - 36:09)
the slightly less angry version of (36:07 - 36:10)
reddit (36:09 - 36:13)
usually there are people (36:10 - 36:16)
all over say you know (36:13 - 36:19)
oh i got it i saw it but (36:16 - 36:19)
yeah so i'm looking at the (36:20 - 36:29)
at the reddit post which it says was uh (36:23 - 36:30)
so i (36:29 - 36:33)
i don't know who this user is (36:30 - 36:35)
because you can't tell somebody's name (36:33 - 36:35)
right (36:35 - 36:37)
but it says two days ago so today if (36:35 - 36:40)
today is sunday was seattle go fest (36:37 - 36:42)
going on on friday (36:40 - 36:44)
yes okay so that is definitely a (36:42 - 36:47)
possibility and then if they are a (36:44 - 36:50)
different person than the actual here (36:47 - 36:52)
we're doing the hard research (36:50 - 36:54)
twitter which they do have a different (36:52 - 36:57)
handle than the twitter user yeah but i (36:54 - 36:59)
have different handles between twitter (36:57 - 37:00)
and other places too now here's the (36:59 - 37:02)
question do they use the same (37:00 - 37:05)
screenshots (37:02 - 37:07)
the other thing is that they kind of do (37:05 - 37:10)
have the same screenshot the first two (37:07 - 37:13)
screenshots in the twit the tweet (37:10 - 37:16)
um were taken to 8 28 and then the one (37:13 - 37:18)
the third one that shows the circuitry (37:16 - 37:20)
quote unquote (37:18 - 37:22)
um it's stats (37:20 - 37:24)
was taken almost two hours later (37:22 - 37:25)
and (37:24 - 37:27)
blanche is saying that it was caught on (37:25 - 37:30)
7 22 july 22nd but the tweet wasn't (37:27 - 37:33)
until the next day (37:30 - 37:37)
at 11 30 in the morning well that's (37:33 - 37:38)
that's okay (37:37 - 37:39)
that that (37:38 - 37:40)
i'm just (37:39 - 37:42)
i feel like i would have mentioned that (37:40 - 37:46)
a little earlier if i was that guy (37:42 - 37:48)
he was out catching pokemon (37:46 - 37:49)
uh (37:48 - 37:52)
if right so the username on reddit (37:49 - 37:54)
it's definitely the same photo because (37:52 - 37:57)
you can see the battery level and uh (37:54 - 37:58)
and the timestamp and everything it's (37:57 - 38:00)
all the same (37:58 - 38:02)
um (38:00 - 38:05)
also the question (38:02 - 38:07)
8 28 am (38:05 - 38:10)
was seattle go fest even started that (38:07 - 38:13)
early what time did they get started (38:10 - 38:15)
and would you have finished a special (38:13 - 38:17)
research (38:15 - 38:20)
wait here here's the key (38:17 - 38:22)
well that's the thing is it is he doing (38:20 - 38:25)
it at 8 28 in the evening instead did (38:22 - 38:26)
this happen (38:25 - 38:29)
they were definitely over (38:26 - 38:30)
but is the special research not (38:29 - 38:32)
available in the evening (38:30 - 38:33)
or is it like you get it and then you (38:32 - 38:36)
can do it like throughout that true but (38:33 - 38:38)
usually i mean i think the go fest (38:36 - 38:41)
happened all day (38:38 - 38:43)
okay so it started (38:41 - 38:46)
for at 9 00 am (38:43 - 38:48)
and ends at 7 00 p.m (38:46 - 38:50)
yep (38:48 - 38:52)
well that's the pokemon center store i (38:50 - 38:54)
see the hours for that but like their (38:52 - 38:57)
website says it's all day so it's (38:54 - 38:59)
possible (38:57 - 39:00)
it's possible i think this will (38:59 - 39:02)
definitely be a question for steve next (39:00 - 39:04)
week is (39:02 - 39:06)
how does he feel about this it's (39:04 - 39:09)
us news of the week it is it is very (39:06 - 39:11)
suspect (39:09 - 39:14)
okay i'm looking at a okay so a ticket (39:11 - 39:15)
for the morning session offers the (39:14 - 39:16)
experience (39:15 - 39:19)
in the saddle park from nine am to one (39:16 - 39:21)
thirty nine to one thirty and then two (39:19 - 39:23)
thirty two seven two thirty seven yeah (39:21 - 39:25)
so (39:23 - 39:25)
it would have to have been evening which (39:26 - 39:30)
would then be why he tweeted the next (39:28 - 39:31)
day because it was already nighttime (39:30 - 39:33)
when he finished he might have realized (39:31 - 39:35)
it the next morning that oh wait this (39:33 - 39:38)
wasn't a thing that anyone else got and (39:35 - 39:40)
i should mention that (39:38 - 39:41)
but (39:40 - 39:43)
interesting all right (39:41 - 39:45)
with that mystery (39:43 - 39:46)
lingering with us (39:45 - 39:49)
let's go to a break (39:46 - 39:51)
and we'll come back with (39:49 - 39:53)
i know what everybody's been looking (39:51 - 39:56)
forward to pokemon masters (39:53 - 39:57)
news (39:56 - 40:00)
but more importantly for the youtube (39:57 - 40:01)
listeners (40:00 - 40:04)
a scarf with birch trees and a zelda (40:01 - 40:06)
cross stitch (40:04 - 40:09)
heck yeah sure (40:06 - 40:09)
and we are back from our break (40:12 - 40:18)
the other thing that i have realized (40:16 - 40:20)
recently i'm imparting all kinds of (40:18 - 40:22)
knowledge first for our for our youtube (40:20 - 40:24)
everybody if you're an audio listener (40:22 - 40:26)
please switch to your youtube (40:24 - 40:28)
immediately so you can see (40:26 - 40:30)
dr mathis's (40:28 - 40:31)
scarf (40:30 - 40:34)
okay so aka cowell (40:31 - 40:35)
yeah well it's very long so this is the (40:34 - 40:38)
pattern that is lovely that's lovely so (40:35 - 40:40)
it looks like birch trees it's like five (40:38 - 40:42)
rows of trees oh i see (40:40 - 40:43)
yes and (40:42 - 40:45)
i made the mistake of asking the person (40:43 - 40:46)
i'm making it for how long they like (40:45 - 40:48)
scarves and she said very long so two (40:46 - 40:50)
full skeins (40:48 - 40:53)
and then um zelda cross stitch that took (40:50 - 40:55)
me 500 hours (40:53 - 40:58)
oh wow (40:55 - 40:59)
so yeah (40:58 - 41:01)
and now you can make that into a pillow (40:59 - 41:04)
for your cat to sleep on i could but i'm (41:01 - 41:06)
just literally giving it to a friend so (41:04 - 41:09)
the realization that i had (41:06 - 41:12)
this is going to blow your minds (41:09 - 41:13)
i have (41:12 - 41:16)
recently been trying to learn hangul (41:13 - 41:19)
which is korean (41:16 - 41:21)
writing and (41:19 - 41:24)
hangul unlike chinese and japanese is (41:21 - 41:26)
phonetic (41:24 - 41:28)
it's a it's a phonetic writing system so (41:26 - 41:30)
if you learn like (41:28 - 41:31)
what the symbols what sound they (41:30 - 41:34)
represent you can write out like if you (41:31 - 41:35)
hear a word you can write out what (41:34 - 41:38)
pretty closely what that word is (41:35 - 41:41)
and in learning this (41:38 - 41:43)
it's phonetic like english (41:41 - 41:46)
right so every letter represents a sound (41:43 - 41:48)
so in (41:46 - 41:50)
japanese you have katakana and hiragana (41:48 - 41:52)
which are also fantastic yeah but that's (41:50 - 41:53)
like kanji is the one that's not yeah (41:52 - 41:56)
right so it's it's it's it's just they (41:53 - 41:58)
don't have any but they do also have (41:56 - 42:01)
some of that whatever what i'm saying (41:58 - 42:04)
quit poking holes in the story what i (42:01 - 42:06)
have learned from this is that as (42:04 - 42:10)
speakers and readers of english (42:06 - 42:10)
we don't (42:10 - 42:14)
read phonetically (42:12 - 42:17)
after we learn how to read (42:14 - 42:18)
we kind of just look at the words and we (42:17 - 42:20)
know what they are (42:18 - 42:22)
right like when i'm trying to read (42:20 - 42:25)
korean i'm sitting there and i'm like (42:22 - 42:27)
that one makes the h sound that one (42:25 - 42:30)
makes the a's like (42:27 - 42:30)
but (42:32 - 42:36)
eventually when you learn a language you (42:33 - 42:38)
just see the combination of letters (42:36 - 42:39)
together and you know what the word is (42:38 - 42:42)
well also what i've also it but we also (42:39 - 42:43)
get those wonderful moments where people (42:42 - 42:45)
have only ever seen the word written (42:43 - 42:47)
yes and then they tried to say it and (42:45 - 42:49)
you're like (42:47 - 42:52)
what i was yeah i was gonna say in in at (42:49 - 42:54)
least american english and i'm assuming (42:52 - 42:56)
all other forms of english uh we've been (42:54 - 42:58)
burned too many times (42:56 - 43:00)
um i can't tell you how long i said (42:58 - 43:03)
colonel (43:00 - 43:03)
instead of colonel yeah (43:03 - 43:08)
oh i had no idea what you're saying (43:06 - 43:11)
exactly but i'd only ever read it right (43:08 - 43:14)
one of my childhood traumas was uh the (43:11 - 43:16)
name patricia (43:14 - 43:17)
which (43:16 - 43:20)
i thought was petrichia (43:17 - 43:22)
because clearly yeah i know that thank (43:20 - 43:24)
you wouldn't it be i would say patricia (43:22 - 43:27)
yeah (43:24 - 43:27)
because why wouldn't you right (43:39 - 43:45)
my sister-in-law uh said macabre for a (43:42 - 43:47)
long time (43:45 - 43:50)
as opposed to macabre (43:47 - 43:52)
oh yeah all right that's your language (43:50 - 43:55)
talk no no bugs we're just talking about (43:52 - 43:58)
just like math and language now what (43:55 - 44:00)
words are going to be classified as fish (43:58 - 44:02)
in california (44:00 - 44:04)
but but you do know that's like one of (44:02 - 44:07)
the famous things about like our writing (44:04 - 44:11)
system is that you can spell fish like p (44:07 - 44:14)
h o g yeah something (44:11 - 44:15)
you can spell it in wild you can spell a (44:14 - 44:17)
lot of things in wild waste and people (44:15 - 44:19)
would get to the pronunciation yeah (44:17 - 44:21)
it's because english is literally a (44:19 - 44:23)
mishmash of like a whole bunch of other (44:21 - 44:25)
ideas (44:23 - 44:28)
all right pokemon masters news which we (44:25 - 44:30)
promised (44:28 - 44:33)
to the the folks why is my link not (44:30 - 44:35)
linked (44:33 - 44:35)
this is a disaster (44:36 - 44:39)
and i (44:39 - 44:43)
there's all kinds of things going on (44:40 - 44:44)
why do we have to do this on the (44:43 - 44:46)
internet we should just like get an (44:44 - 44:48)
auditorium and sit in front of people (44:46 - 44:49)
and just like talk to them and then we (44:48 - 44:51)
don't have to worry about that would be (44:49 - 44:53)
better all right (44:51 - 44:55)
this is from pokemon masters dash (44:53 - 44:58)
game.com (44:55 - 45:02)
from the news section of their website (44:58 - 45:06)
as of july 20th 2022 (45:02 - 45:09)
you can now team up with a fair (45:06 - 45:12)
exclusive sink pair in the poke fair (45:09 - 45:13)
scout (45:12 - 45:15)
i don't know what that means but you can (45:13 - 45:19)
get five star ingo and excadrill and 5 (45:15 - 45:22)
star emmett and archeops (45:19 - 45:24)
they're featured in this limited time (45:22 - 45:25)
pokey fair scout (45:24 - 45:28)
five star sync pairs have a 10 chance of (45:25 - 45:31)
appearing in the poke fair scout (45:28 - 45:32)
uh (45:31 - 45:34)
i mean basically ingo and emmett (45:32 - 45:36)
are back (45:34 - 45:38)
were they in it before yeah so this is (45:36 - 45:40)
the return of the ingo and emmett (45:38 - 45:41)
uh (45:40 - 45:43)
event they're back to build their subway (45:41 - 45:44)
again (45:43 - 45:46)
um (45:44 - 45:46)
so (45:46 - 45:51)
they've been this is all the run-up of (45:46 - 45:53)
repeats and new stuff to get you to (45:51 - 45:54)
spend all of your gems before the (45:53 - 45:57)
three-year anniversary happens in august (45:54 - 45:58)
uh (45:57 - 46:01)
i will say though uh (45:58 - 46:03)
karina and marshetto and gloria and (46:01 - 46:05)
hershey food were just released for the (46:03 - 46:08)
first time and karina and marshadow (46:05 - 46:11)
is very broken it's a very broken (46:08 - 46:13)
sink pair and i love them and it's the (46:11 - 46:15)
greatest (46:13 - 46:17)
do you actually play masters or do you (46:15 - 46:19)
just set it to auto play and collect i (46:17 - 46:22)
play masters uh i i mean i do (46:19 - 46:24)
auto play certain aspects of it like i'm (46:22 - 46:25)
not gonna (46:24 - 46:29)
i'm not gonna do the daily just collect (46:25 - 46:30)
tickets fight (46:29 - 46:32)
each time but i do the hard content all (46:30 - 46:35)
right so they did uh do some fun things (46:32 - 46:37)
with karina they've done (46:35 - 46:41)
uh emmett and ingo are back and also (46:37 - 46:44)
uh you can get a shiny thai rogue in the (46:41 - 46:47)
eggs there's an egg event going on this (46:44 - 46:49)
is all just fluff until the third year (46:47 - 46:50)
anniversary and they're basically trying (46:49 - 46:52)
to get you to spend all of your stuff (46:50 - 46:54)
before the third year anniversary so you (46:52 - 46:55)
have to spend more money for the 30-year (46:54 - 46:56)
anniversary (46:55 - 46:59)
ash is not yet a sink pair that you can (46:56 - 47:01)
pull (46:59 - 47:02)
but i guarantee it will be a sink pair (47:01 - 47:05)
for the third anniversary i i (47:02 - 47:09)
there's they put way too much into that (47:05 - 47:12)
pair and that look for it not to be (47:09 - 47:14)
something you can pull in the game so (47:12 - 47:15)
this (47:14 - 47:18)
calls or brings to mind a more important (47:15 - 47:19)
question (47:18 - 47:22)
now we know greg has played pokemon (47:19 - 47:24)
legends (47:22 - 47:26)
dr mathis have you played pokemon (47:24 - 47:28)
legends arceus (47:26 - 47:30)
it is one of the only video games i have (47:28 - 47:32)
ever actually beat (47:30 - 47:34)
did you beat (47:32 - 47:35)
to (47:34 - 47:38)
like the dialga palgia or did you get (47:35 - 47:40)
all the way past that (47:38 - 47:42)
i can't remember i got credits and then (47:40 - 47:44)
i think i'm still working past it past (47:42 - 47:48)
credits um so i but it is something i (47:44 - 47:50)
very much enjoyed that game this game (47:48 - 47:52)
has been out long enough that it's kind (47:50 - 47:55)
of spoilers or like (47:52 - 47:57)
it's too late kids (47:55 - 47:59)
does (47:57 - 48:01)
is it ingo that's in the game (47:59 - 48:08)
or am it bingo does ingo get to go home (48:01 - 48:08)
so (48:08 - 48:13)
this this is where my mind is breaking (48:09 - 48:16)
it's the emoji with the (48:13 - 48:18)
exploding brain (48:16 - 48:21)
if they do a remake of pokemon black and (48:18 - 48:22)
white in black and white too which is (48:21 - 48:27)
clearly coming sometime soon (48:22 - 48:30)
are they going to leave ingo out yeah (48:27 - 48:32)
ingo has been stolen (48:30 - 48:35)
and will never appear (48:32 - 48:35)
well actually (48:41 - 48:45)
ingo would have been stolen from the 3d (48:45 - 48:50)
universe diaz universe so if they remake (48:48 - 48:52)
it in the switch universe it is (48:50 - 48:53)
technically a different universe that (48:52 - 48:56)
they're building so ingo could appear (48:53 - 48:57)
that's not how (48:56 - 48:58)
no (48:57 - 49:01)
yes no they established multi they (48:58 - 49:02)
established the multiverse and to make a (49:01 - 49:04)
ruby happy (49:02 - 49:06)
clearly that is true yes okay what if (49:04 - 49:08)
when you go through when you're pushed (49:06 - 49:11)
through the wormhole into arceus there (49:08 - 49:13)
is a copy of you that is sent back into (49:11 - 49:17)
your your world pure (49:13 - 49:17)
it's like the episodes where star trek (49:25 - 49:30)
and doctor who both did this where like (49:26 - 49:32)
in star trek it was a transporter (49:30 - 49:34)
accident i don't remember what it wasn't (49:32 - 49:36)
in doctor who but it was like (49:34 - 49:39)
time it was amy pond no no no but it's (49:36 - 49:40)
like (49:39 - 49:42)
the the character got split (49:40 - 49:46)
and one spent like 10 years in this (49:42 - 49:48)
horrible nightmare world while the other (49:46 - 49:50)
one like was with the (49:48 - 49:52)
the rest of the crew for like a minute (49:50 - 49:54)
and then they came back and they're like (49:52 - 49:56)
well now we've got two of them do we (49:54 - 49:57)
kill off (49:56 - 50:00)
yep one of my very favorite movies has (49:57 - 50:03)
this trope in it as well of like (50:00 - 50:05)
oh it's you're transported but nope (50:03 - 50:07)
you're just copied and what happens to (50:05 - 50:10)
the copy yeah um (50:07 - 50:11)
that (50:10 - 50:13)
i would love that to be i mean so the (50:11 - 50:14)
right thing (50:13 - 50:16)
they'll answer their incident they kept (50:14 - 50:18)
both of them alive so (50:16 - 50:22)
if ingo is in black to white to (50:18 - 50:24)
black though white three black three (50:22 - 50:25)
white (50:24 - 50:30)
three black z white x um (50:25 - 50:31)
if he's in that then that's confirmed (50:30 - 50:32)
that (50:31 - 50:34)
when you are (50:32 - 50:36)
sent through the wormhole by (50:34 - 50:38)
arceus (50:36 - 50:41)
that he clones you or they could just (50:38 - 50:43)
make it part and this is this (50:41 - 50:46)
tpci you should be sending me royalty (50:43 - 50:47)
checks (50:46 - 50:50)
make it part of the remake (50:47 - 50:52)
that (50:50 - 50:55)
you see and go get taken you see yeah (50:52 - 50:56)
they'll fall through the wormhole where (50:55 - 50:59)
ingo gets on a train and there's like a (50:56 - 51:02)
and then the train never comes back also (50:59 - 51:03)
we need a (51:02 - 51:06)
scarlet violet rescue mission where you (51:03 - 51:09)
have to go across universes in time (51:06 - 51:10)
to (51:09 - 51:12)
save ingo and bring him back to the (51:10 - 51:13)
future so he could be back with his (51:12 - 51:15)
brother (51:13 - 51:19)
well the rescue rangers were in pokemon (51:15 - 51:21)
uh the other one (51:19 - 51:23)
what's that (51:21 - 51:24)
again i can't think of the name of (51:23 - 51:26)
something pokemon (51:24 - 51:29)
myth redundant history (51:26 - 51:31)
that was the rescue ring that was the (51:29 - 51:32)
rescue rangers yes (51:31 - 51:34)
all right more (51:32 - 51:35)
news (51:34 - 51:39)

squishmallows too i've never heard of a (52:17 - 52:22)
squishmallow but sure (52:20 - 52:24)
if you don't know about squishmallows (52:22 - 52:27)
these are irresistible i'm already (52:24 - 52:29)
resisting them (52:27 - 52:31)
sometimes food and drink toys that you (52:29 - 52:34)
can't stop squeezing (52:31 - 52:36)
the company itself claims that they are (52:34 - 52:39)
the softest cutest cuddliest plush (52:36 - 52:43)
around okay we have to believe that (52:39 - 52:44)
we don't have to believe we don't have (52:43 - 52:47)
to believe anything so surely these two (52:44 - 52:49)
things are a match made in heaven (52:47 - 52:52)
yesterday on twitter squishmallows and (52:49 - 52:55)
pokemon playfully teased a collaboration (52:52 - 52:57)

here's a good look at both blah blah (53:12 - 53:16)
there's a twitter blah blah the (53:14 - 53:19)
attention to detail is phenomenal on (53:16 - 53:21)
both soft toys but we're in love with (53:19 - 53:23)
gengar in particular (53:21 - 53:26)
the spikes on its back are perfect and (53:23 - 53:27)
the signature grin just makes the (53:26 - 53:30)
mischievous ghost type pokemon look even (53:27 - 53:32)
cuter (53:30 - 53:34)
attendees got a sneak preview before (53:32 - 53:36)
comic com officially opens up later (53:34 - 53:39)

what other round boys (54:01 - 54:05)
what other round boys could they make (54:03 - 54:09)
you don't like a little chocolate chew (54:05 - 54:09)
no (54:09 - 54:13)
i'm a little i'm a little over pikachu (54:11 - 54:15)
at this point i get the (54:13 - 54:19)
mascot but wow hot tape oh boy (54:15 - 54:22)
hot takes i don't really have any good (54:19 - 54:25)
round bugs (54:22 - 54:25)
let's talk about the rumors of (54:26 - 54:31)
togepi and snarlax also being in this (54:29 - 54:33)
line of course they are (54:31 - 54:37)
those are also not insects (54:33 - 54:38)
correct yeah i doubt i doubt there will (54:37 - 54:40)
ever be an insect one (54:38 - 54:42)
um well what there's a pill bug one (54:40 - 54:44)
isn't there venip (54:42 - 54:47)
venipedes scolipedes line that's not (54:44 - 54:50)
yeah around there (54:47 - 54:53)
that's a poisonous centipede the closest (54:50 - 54:55)
thing to a pill bug would be wimpod and (54:53 - 54:58)
golisapod because pill bugs are isopods (54:55 - 55:00)
but anyways (54:58 - 55:02)
um (55:00 - 55:04)
i would be on board (55:02 - 55:06)
i would i would be on board with the (55:04 - 55:09)
snorlax if it was like (55:06 - 55:10)
snow relax (55:09 - 55:12)

all right (55:18 - 55:21)
greg (55:18 - 55:21)
they're cute i think they're over (55:24 - 55:29)
exaggerating the attention to detail a (55:27 - 55:30)
little bit (55:29 - 55:32)
but (55:30 - 55:33)
i'm not i (55:32 - 55:37)
i am old i am not on the squish malo bus (55:33 - 55:39)

like the the pikachu in this (59:06 - 59:10)
build-a-bear picture looks more bare (59:08 - 59:11)
than pikachu (59:10 - 59:13)
there's something weird about its head (59:11 - 59:14)
to me (59:13 - 59:19)
uh no that's a traditional pika head (59:14 - 59:21)
is it (59:19 - 59:22)
pink (59:21 - 59:24)
it's too too cheeky (59:22 - 59:26)
and it feels too cheeky too much in the (59:24 - 59:29)
cheeks it's got bare cheeks instead of (59:26 - 59:34)
cheeks it feels very bare very cheeky (59:29 - 59:34)
i don't know (59:35 - 59:38)
do you prefer the purple jacket or the (59:37 - 59:40)
red jacket purple (59:38 - 59:42)
oh i like the red with the lightning (59:40 - 59:43)
bolt (59:42 - 59:45)
oh is this for scarlet and violet (59:43 - 59:46)
yeah oh (59:45 - 59:48)
deep cake (59:46 - 59:49)
um (59:48 - 59:50)
[Music] (59:49 - 59:52)
yeah i mean i i'm a big fan of purple (59:50 - 59:55)
but i'm (59:52 - 59:55)
so (59:56 - 59:58)
you don't like squish metals you don't (59:57 - 60:01)
like build-a-bears you only like bugs i (59:58 - 60:02)
don't like bugs i did google i was (60:01 - 60:04)
googling (60:02 - 60:06)
uh during it first of all whether (60:04 - 60:08)
there's any bug pokemon that are build a (60:06 - 60:09)
bear the answer is no and then the (60:08 - 60:11)
second if there's just any bugs that are (60:09 - 60:12)
build a bear the answer is no so i don't (60:11 - 60:15)
know (60:12 - 60:15)
let me look at what i would consider (60:22 - 60:28)
probably another (60:25 - 60:30)
it is an insect (60:28 - 60:33)
it is an insect (60:30 - 60:35)
so it actually has six legs (60:33 - 60:37)
actually has two wings so that's good (60:35 - 60:39)
um so it's looking (60:37 - 60:42)
it's looking uh very hymenoperin very uh (60:39 - 60:43)
waspy (60:42 - 60:46)
that mouth is straight up fly though so (60:43 - 60:48)
i have no idea what's going on (60:46 - 60:50)
yeah (60:48 - 60:52)
well it should only have two wings then (60:50 - 60:54)
how many you just said it had two wings (60:52 - 60:57)
no it has four wings (60:54 - 60:59)
you see how it has a hind wing and a (60:57 - 61:00)
four wing (60:59 - 61:01)
like keep (61:00 - 61:03)
memorize do you have like a chart of (61:01 - 61:05)
like bug rules like across from you that (61:03 - 61:08)
we can't see like across from your (61:05 - 61:10)
microscope there that it's like all (61:08 - 61:12)
right i'm gonna go down the chart uh too (61:10 - 61:15)
many wings (61:12 - 61:15)
i do have a lot of bug things down here (61:15 - 61:20)
you have a lot of bugs literally (61:18 - 61:23)
formerly living inside which (61:20 - 61:26)
is as buff (61:23 - 61:28)
has this kind of muscle i don't want to (61:26 - 61:30)
know i don't it's probably those kissing (61:28 - 61:33)
madagascar hissing cockroaches yeah (61:30 - 61:34)
those things are (61:33 - 61:37)
huge and people keep them as pets they (61:34 - 61:39)
don't get that big (61:37 - 61:39)
what (61:39 - 61:42)
the madagascar hissing cockroaches (61:39 - 61:43)
they're (61:42 - 61:45)
they're precious okay they're what i (61:43 - 61:48)
consider not big i was like (61:45 - 61:50)
you could hold (61:48 - 61:52)
one in your hand that's too big right (61:50 - 61:55)
you can't hold two in your hand but it's (61:52 - 61:57)
not like that's not like buff it's just (61:55 - 61:59)
large (61:57 - 62:02)
i got to think about the buff one (61:59 - 62:04)
[Music] (62:02 - 62:05)
and we'll have a debate over what the (62:04 - 62:07)
difference between buff and large okay (62:05 - 62:09)
yeah (62:07 - 62:11)
that's that next powerpoint presentation (62:09 - 62:12)
for trivia night (62:11 - 62:15)
all right heck yeah somebody decided (62:12 - 62:20)
that we had to have uh real pokemon (62:15 - 62:20)
if we don't all right step back and this (62:21 - 62:26)
is off pokemon go live.com they don't (62:24 - 62:28)
give credit to their authors on this (62:26 - 62:30)

raids are (63:26 - 63:30)
we don't care about one star (63:28 - 63:32)

i care about oh sneazel rosalia and (63:32 - 63:38)
shinx so roselia ken is a one star raid (63:35 - 63:43)

and for research tasks you have a lot of (64:06 - 64:14)
insects bugs and such that nobody's (64:11 - 64:17)
particularly caring for so (64:14 - 64:19)
collection challenges (64:17 - 64:20)

playing pokemon go upcoming events are (64:52 - 64:56)
subject to change blah blah blah blah (64:54 - 64:59)
blah blah blah blah (64:56 - 65:00)
so (64:59 - 65:03)
hissui is infiltrating (65:00 - 65:06)
pokemon go again (65:03 - 65:12)
i i love how pokemon go is just the (65:06 - 65:13)
true (65:12 - 65:18)
post-modern mashup of yeah all (65:13 - 65:20)
we're we're gonna have the introduction (65:18 - 65:23)
of the ultra beasts and new hisooties to (65:20 - 65:26)
smash together into a melange (65:23 - 65:29)
of the pokemon (65:26 - 65:29)
i universe you skipped over the part (65:36 - 65:39)
where it says that it's from wednesday (65:37 - 65:41)
july 27th at 10 a.m to tuesday august (65:39 - 65:45)
2nd at 8 00 pm i did skip that over um (65:41 - 65:46)
it's interesting that it's going until 8 (65:45 - 65:49)
pm at uh local time (65:46 - 65:50)
it's also interesting that it starts at (65:49 - 65:54)
10 a.m local time why why not well i (65:50 - 65:56)
guess they want to be respectful of (65:54 - 65:59)
not having people play pokemon go at (65:56 - 66:02)
family hours (65:59 - 66:03)
we'll call it (66:02 - 66:07)
family hours family hours (66:03 - 66:07)
um i'm stoked because i sh i do not (66:08 - 66:15)
i do not yet have a shiny worm pole (66:12 - 66:18)
oh and i'm hoping to get one (66:15 - 66:20)
what what what final evolution or is it (66:18 - 66:23)
gonna stay shiny wear pearl forever (66:20 - 66:26)
uh i love that little purple purple baby (66:23 - 66:28)
here's the question (66:26 - 66:30)
how do you (66:28 - 66:31)
evolve (66:30 - 66:33)
the (66:31 - 66:33)
[Music] (66:39 - 66:43)
right because (66:41 - 66:45)
the issue with those special ride (66:43 - 66:47)
pokemon in legends was that they had (66:45 - 66:48)
these really (66:47 - 66:51)
hyper difficult contrived methods to (66:48 - 66:54)
evolve them (66:51 - 66:56)
and i'm like i'm not going to waste my (66:54 - 66:59)
time with trying to find a full moon to (66:56 - 67:01)
evolve in ursa ring (66:59 - 67:03)
but (67:01 - 67:05)
finally pokemon go may have some value (67:03 - 67:07)
in my life if i can just get the hisui (67:05 - 67:09)
and ursa ring and evolve it there and (67:07 - 67:11)
then not have to worry about (67:09 - 67:15)
pokemon legends anymore (67:11 - 67:18)
i thought the sneasel was pretty easy oh (67:15 - 67:21)
i don't know what about the quill fish (67:18 - 67:23)
uh i mean quail fish is pretty easy as (67:21 - 67:25)
far as things you have to do that's (67:23 - 67:27)
probably why these are the first ones (67:25 - 67:28)
that are being released is that they (67:27 - 67:32)
don't have difficult evolutions (67:28 - 67:33)
because the earth's ring is you have to (67:32 - 67:35)
have the right time of day and the right (67:33 - 67:38)
item which makes that yeah that was it (67:35 - 67:40)
one's a bear to deal with (67:38 - 67:43)
ha ha ha (67:40 - 67:46)
[Music] (67:43 - 67:48)
you just have to have (67:46 - 67:50)
use a razor claw on historian's nasal (67:48 - 67:52)
during the day they'll probably have (67:50 - 67:56)
like a suet jesus stone (67:52 - 67:56)
assuming (67:56 - 67:57)
[Music] (67:56 - 67:59)
um (67:57 - 68:00)
though it would be cool if they used (67:59 - 68:02)
like king's rock and all that crap so i (68:00 - 68:05)
can have a use for those like (68:02 - 68:08)
i have so many and i should throw them (68:05 - 68:10)
out and i can't i keep dumping them to (68:08 - 68:11)
three (68:10 - 68:14)
but still i can't get i can't (68:11 - 68:16)
do any less max my brain is like i need (68:14 - 68:18)
to keep them (68:16 - 68:20)
gotta keep them you never know (68:18 - 68:22)
all right you never know (68:20 - 68:23)
greg (68:22 - 68:25)
time for question of the week (68:23 - 68:28)
please mister please (68:25 - 68:33)
ask me the question of the week (68:28 - 68:33)
all right our youtube question of the (68:33 - 68:36)
week (68:35 - 68:40)
uh with gallerian zigzagoon announced (68:36 - 68:42)
for next month's pokemon go community (68:40 - 68:45)
day it got me thinking is there a (68:42 - 68:47)
pokemon that you are surprised hasn't (68:45 - 68:49)
gotten a community day yet (68:47 - 68:51)
for me i'm surprised we have seen a (68:49 - 68:53)
community or i guess he says i'm (68:51 - 68:55)
surprised we haven't seen a community (68:53 - 68:59)
day for poliwag or tyrogue yet (68:55 - 69:00)
you guys answer i forgot to look up the (68:59 - 69:03)
name of that user to give them the (69:00 - 69:05)
proper (69:03 - 69:07)
credit who do you want to see or who are (69:05 - 69:09)
you surprised has not had a community (69:07 - 69:12)
day yet (69:09 - 69:12)
we don't right (69:13 - 69:16)
i'm surprised we haven't had a farfish (69:16 - 69:19)
one yet (69:18 - 69:21)
that or have we i have to remember which (69:19 - 69:22)
ones we have had what we haven't had i (69:21 - 69:24)
don't think we've had far-fetched i was (69:22 - 69:28)
looking them up um (69:24 - 69:28)
i don't think we've had a far-fetched (69:29 - 69:32)
one yet (69:31 - 69:34)
um i thought we would have when they (69:32 - 69:37)
released surfaced into the game i (69:34 - 69:39)
thought for sure we would have one (69:37 - 69:42)
for that and i don't think we've had one (69:39 - 69:44)
well so i guess like what is the (69:42 - 69:46)
criterion they usually have one that has (69:44 - 69:48)
at least one evolution correct usually (69:46 - 69:51)
three evolutions usually three not (69:48 - 69:55)
always so that question came from uh (69:51 - 69:57)
youtube user jordan (69:55 - 69:58)

uh aflabe community today oh true true (72:23 - 72:29)
hands-down with all the flower colors (72:27 - 72:31)
yeah all the color colors available and (72:29 - 72:33)
the shiny available (72:31 - 72:35)
that that that is when i would that is (72:33 - 72:38)
when i would go out and all right shiny (72:35 - 72:40)
flower colors (72:38 - 72:42)
available (72:40 - 72:44)
can you imagine how much work you would (72:42 - 72:49)
have to do to get every shiny flabe (72:44 - 72:49)
and i would do it (72:49 - 72:53)
would you do you love flabebe as much as (72:51 - 72:55)
i love flabebe (72:53 - 72:56)
it's a pretty cute pokemon (72:55 - 72:58)
i you know but what's funny is for as (72:56 - 73:00)
much as i love flippa bait (72:58 - 73:02)
this is still not gonna break my (73:00 - 73:06)
backplane okay (73:02 - 73:06)
we have not had a knitter and (73:06 - 73:11)
i didn't think so i'm surprised we (73:09 - 73:12)
haven't (73:11 - 73:14)
well but see i mean i feel like they (73:12 - 73:15)
were part of like (73:14 - 73:17)
an event but not just not their own (73:15 - 73:20)
community because i definitely remember (73:17 - 73:22)
when they were like they were they were (73:20 - 73:25)
all spawning at the same time and at (73:22 - 73:27)
one time or another and everyone was (73:25 - 73:31)
trying to get the opposite chinese (73:27 - 73:34)
yeah but if you didn't end iran like (73:31 - 73:36)
as a community day then either people (73:34 - 73:38)
would complain because you were doing (73:36 - 73:40)
both genders (73:38 - 73:41)
or (73:40 - 73:46)
that they picked only one of the genders (73:41 - 73:46)
right that's the way people are (73:46 - 73:50)
yeah (73:48 - 73:53)
having to catch five flower shinies (73:50 - 73:55)
would be an amazing community today (73:53 - 73:58)
i i think that would be so much fun they (73:55 - 74:01)
better they better time it or like (73:58 - 74:03)
do it with a longer community day then (74:01 - 74:07)
because that's not going to happen (74:03 - 74:10)
this shorter show (74:07 - 74:10)
shorter day is really (74:11 - 74:16)
frustrating i don't know the thing is is (74:13 - 74:17)
the shorter i'll say this this is my one (74:16 - 74:19)
thing the memorial that i'm going to for (74:17 - 74:23)
my cousin goes the exact amount of time (74:19 - 74:24)
three hours of community date i'm like (74:23 - 74:26)
if it was longer (74:24 - 74:29)
i could make it couldn't i (74:26 - 74:31)
we do need to (74:29 - 74:32)
uh complain about this every week so (74:31 - 74:34)
that the niantic people that are (74:32 - 74:36)
listening (74:34 - 74:38)
so uh well i'm gonna need you to come (74:36 - 74:40)
and do raids so that they start spawning (74:38 - 74:41)
for me (74:40 - 74:44)
after my memorial i will wait outside of (74:41 - 74:46)
the memorial service at the club we're (74:44 - 74:48)
going to a restaurant (74:46 - 74:51)
so i don't know what the plan is (74:48 - 74:53)
okay i had an honorable mention question (74:51 - 74:54)
of the week from (74:53 - 74:56)
youtube and i had to make an honorable (74:54 - 74:58)
mention because (74:56 - 75:01)
neither one of you guys play pokemon tcg (74:58 - 75:02)
so (75:01 - 75:04)
it's from sleeve card and the question (75:02 - 75:06)
is what mechanic from another card game (75:04 - 75:08)
do you think would translate well to the (75:06 - 75:09)
pokemon (75:08 - 75:11)
tcg and you have to kind of underneath (75:09 - 75:13)
you would have to know what the (75:11 - 75:17)
mechanics of the pokemon tcg are to (75:13 - 75:20)
understand what mechanic (75:17 - 75:22)
you've played it though right i have so (75:20 - 75:24)
we could mention the mechanics that we (75:22 - 75:25)
that we enjoyed and you can say yes or (75:24 - 75:27)
no that's that's happened (75:25 - 75:31)
okay what what card game is your main (75:27 - 75:33)
so well i used to play i'm just really (75:31 - 75:35)
showing my nerd card today the world of (75:33 - 75:37)
warcraft trading card game and i have (75:35 - 75:39)
those uh yeah i still have like six (75:37 - 75:41)
decks and (75:39 - 75:42)
uh the tcg mechanic that i really (75:41 - 75:44)
enjoyed from that was (75:42 - 75:45)
rating (75:44 - 75:46)
so (75:45 - 75:49)
someone would play as the raid so like i (75:46 - 75:52)
would play like as onyxia's lair the (75:49 - 75:54)
raid and i had my own deck and (75:52 - 75:56)
everything and then (75:54 - 75:58)
people would fight against me they have (75:56 - 76:01)
that they have max raid battles okay (75:58 - 76:03)
yeah that's what i would like i mean (76:01 - 76:04)
that's new but that's not really a (76:03 - 76:07)
mechanic that's that's a format (76:04 - 76:09)
max (76:07 - 76:09)
so like the raid battle was wasn't just (76:09 - 76:15)
like the raid boss it was also these (76:12 - 76:16)
these cute little things like there were (76:15 - 76:19)
all of the the minions and the other (76:16 - 76:22)
npcs that were in the lair in onyxia's (76:19 - 76:25)
lair and there was this um (76:22 - 76:27)
it was a cat that if you killed the cat (76:25 - 76:28)
uh (76:27 - 76:30)
then you (76:28 - 76:31)
later on there was a card that could (76:30 - 76:33)
show up and if you had if you had like (76:31 - 76:36)
aoed and killed the cat as well as (76:33 - 76:38)
as well as damaging onyxia (76:36 - 76:40)
when this card came up you'd like (76:38 - 76:42)
wipe and so you were like (76:40 - 76:44)
just like the raid yeah and so you were (76:42 - 76:46)
like don't touch the cat (76:44 - 76:48)
you're saying this like world of (76:46 - 76:50)
warcraft card game played similar to (76:48 - 76:52)
netrunner where it's it's not (76:50 - 76:54)
like two people doing the same thing (76:52 - 76:57)
it's two people doing different things (76:54 - 76:59)
interactively (76:57 - 77:02)
or more than two people so like (76:59 - 77:04)
someone would be playing it's not it's (77:02 - 77:06)
almost like d like someone's playing as (77:04 - 77:09)
the dm yeah the raid and then everyone (77:06 - 77:12)
else is playing as their character like (77:09 - 77:14)
they have their decks and their (77:12 - 77:16)
characters (77:14 - 77:17)
i mean it would be basically be a max (77:16 - 77:19)
raid battle so someone would be playing (77:17 - 77:21)
as the (77:19 - 77:23)
the pokemon in the max raider boss the (77:21 - 77:26)
boss but they would have their own (77:23 - 77:27)
deck and they'd be playing their own (77:26 - 77:29)
deck and then everyone else would be (77:27 - 77:31)
playing (77:29 - 77:31)
their (77:31 - 77:33)
decks (77:31 - 77:35)
that would be mine (77:33 - 77:36)
i'm sure that greg has way more though (77:35 - 77:39)
because he's way more tcg tonight uh i'm (77:36 - 77:44)
trying to think of what mechanics in (77:39 - 77:44)
i mean you know i'm you know i like my (77:47 - 77:51)
plus one plus one counters i have a (77:49 - 77:54)
puzzle yeah that's what counterfeits (77:51 - 77:54)
uh i love i love making things big and (77:55 - 77:59)
powerful (77:58 - 78:00)
um (77:59 - 78:04)
like i would like a commander format for (78:00 - 78:06)
for (78:04 - 78:08)
where you like you have your (78:06 - 78:10)
trainer and then you have your pokemon (78:08 - 78:11)
sort of (78:10 - 78:14)
interaction i would like that for (78:11 - 78:18)
dcg but i would like a way to do like (78:14 - 78:21)
to take a a card that you grow right (78:18 - 78:23)
like because you don't really grow you (78:21 - 78:25)
know like add a bunch of things to to (78:23 - 78:28)
pokemon and tcg like (78:25 - 78:30)
they don't like get plus 30 plus 30 (78:28 - 78:32)
because you attached to whatever but (78:30 - 78:34)
there are there actually are cards that (78:32 - 78:36)
do those kinds of others yeah yeah yeah (78:34 - 78:38)
like there will be like expert belts um (78:36 - 78:40)
and things like that it's like or items (78:38 - 78:42)
that you can just say like for the next (78:40 - 78:44)
attack add plus 10 (78:42 - 78:46)
to the attack (78:44 - 78:48)
those kinds of things (78:46 - 78:50)
are there decks that you can play in (78:48 - 78:52)
pokemon that (78:50 - 78:54)
like in the first turn you've already (78:52 - 78:57)
won and your opponent just there were (78:54 - 78:59)
you they i think they've taken that out (78:57 - 79:03)
but yes the dock used to exist (78:59 - 79:03)
yeah it's just like because you could (79:04 - 79:07)
since (79:06 - 79:10)
the the history of that is that (79:07 - 79:13)
the only rule on what pokemon you put (79:10 - 79:14)
out as your starter is it has to be a (79:13 - 79:16)
basic pokemon (79:14 - 79:18)
which was fine at the beginning of the (79:16 - 79:20)
pokemon game because all the basic (79:18 - 79:23)
pokemon were like squirtle and you know (79:20 - 79:24)
these really small (79:23 - 79:27)
but eventually they got to a point where (79:24 - 79:29)
basic pokemon could be fully evolved (79:27 - 79:30)
pokemon (79:29 - 79:35)
so you'd have like a squirtle against uh (79:30 - 79:37)
venusaur ex (79:35 - 79:37)
which (79:37 - 79:41)
it's for for one green energy like does (79:37 - 79:43)
200 and like squirtle's gone (79:41 - 79:44)
but (79:43 - 79:47)
they've made some changes um i would say (79:44 - 79:48)
like mechanic (79:47 - 79:50)
that i think (79:48 - 79:53)
the the one thing that differentiates (79:50 - 79:56)
card games like there's a lot of (79:53 - 79:59)
sliding things that you can do to to (79:56 - 80:01)
sort of change difficulty level um and (79:59 - 80:02)
also (80:01 - 80:05)
the rng component of a card game (80:02 - 80:07)
um but one thing that mitigates rng is (80:05 - 80:10)
interactivity which the pokemon tc does (80:07 - 80:12)
not have (80:10 - 80:15)
right when it's my opponent's turn (80:12 - 80:16)
i'm sitting there looking at my head (80:15 - 80:19)
yeah there's nothing i can do there's no (80:16 - 80:21)
instant cards (80:19 - 80:23)
there's no flash no handle (80:21 - 80:27)
nothing nothing so i would uh (80:23 - 80:28)
find a way to do some sort of (80:27 - 80:31)
interactivity some sort of response to (80:28 - 80:33)
actions that my opponent what if we took (80:31 - 80:36)
the yo-yo you activated my trap card and (80:33 - 80:39)
introduced the snaga mechanic from (80:36 - 80:40)
gale of darkness so you could steal (80:39 - 80:43)
their pokemon from them no (80:40 - 80:46)
as you just said (80:43 - 80:46)
all right our slack question of the week (80:46 - 80:50)
this is from brandon (80:48 - 80:52)
since we have pokemon basketball with (80:50 - 80:54)
unite (80:52 - 80:56)
what's another sport that you'd want to (80:54 - 80:58)
see pokemon with (80:56 - 81:01)
curly (80:58 - 81:01)
how dare you do it and see how far you (81:05 - 81:09)
get (81:08 - 81:12)
like dude wait do you know curling is so (81:09 - 81:14)
popular in the twin cities (81:12 - 81:17)
that you have to get on a waiting list (81:14 - 81:20)
to get into a curling club i have (81:17 - 81:22)
friends wearing curling clubs they're so (81:20 - 81:23)
crazy are you in a curling club greg you (81:22 - 81:26)
look no i don't i don't do sport okay i (81:23 - 81:28)
don't support either well the sport i do (81:26 - 81:30)
is lifting so (81:28 - 81:34)
how would pokemon curling work (81:30 - 81:37)
so you have your your penguin pokemon on (81:34 - 81:38)
its belly (81:37 - 81:41)
it runs and starts sliding and then you (81:38 - 81:42)
as the trainer and your trainer friends (81:41 - 81:44)
use the brooms to try to get it but no (81:42 - 81:47)
no no no no like right (81:44 - 81:49)
let's think outside the taco (81:47 - 81:50)
right (81:49 - 81:52)
that's how that phrase something like (81:50 - 81:53)
that (81:52 - 81:56)
inside the bun right what is curling you (81:53 - 81:59)
are throwing a stone something very very (81:56 - 82:01)
heavy you're not throwing it but you're (81:59 - 82:04)
like you're scooting it on the ice (82:01 - 82:08)
to try to hit a particular target that (82:04 - 82:10)
looks like a bullseye at the other end (82:08 - 82:11)
it's (82:10 - 82:13)
kind of similar to bocce (82:11 - 82:16)
um and either knocking your opponent's (82:13 - 82:19)
stone out of the target or (82:16 - 82:21)
you know there's whatever rules (82:19 - 82:23)
there are so many things we could do (82:21 - 82:25)
with pokemon (82:23 - 82:28)
you could have your ice type pokemon (82:25 - 82:30)
that make the ice (82:28 - 82:32)
like reduce the friction (82:30 - 82:34)
so your stone goes faster you could have (82:32 - 82:37)
fire type pokemon that can melt portions (82:34 - 82:39)
of the ice so that your stone goes (82:37 - 82:42)
slower or curves or whatever yeah you (82:39 - 82:45)
could have your flying types like push (82:42 - 82:47)
the stone (82:45 - 82:49)
uh you know tailwind those kinds of (82:47 - 82:52)
things this is like all kinds of things (82:49 - 82:54)
um you could have (82:52 - 82:55)
your (82:54 - 82:57)
ground type pokemon earthquake and like (82:55 - 82:59)
all the stones get rattled out of place (82:57 - 83:02)
[Laughter] (82:59 - 83:03)
there's a lot of things that you could (83:02 - 83:05)
try to do (83:03 - 83:08)
definitely (83:05 - 83:08)
yeah cody (83:08 - 83:13)
i just stopped bowling (83:10 - 83:14)
and (83:13 - 83:17)
you just get to throw around pokemon i (83:14 - 83:19)
you ain't around bugs (83:17 - 83:21)
around pokemon (83:19 - 83:22)
i would like to see because don't they (83:21 - 83:23)
have like (83:22 - 83:25)
mario and sonic go to the olympics and (83:23 - 83:27)
it's supposed to be like all kinds of (83:25 - 83:29)
olympic sports with mario and sonic yeah (83:27 - 83:31)
i would want to see like (83:29 - 83:33)
pokemon track and field where they have (83:31 - 83:36)
like literally all the track and field (83:33 - 83:37)

i'm going to read the whole thing give (84:35 - 84:39)
cody one more chance to (84:37 - 84:41)
rack her brain (84:39 - 84:44)
to try to get the answer (84:41 - 84:46)
dr mathis use (84:44 - 84:49)
your higher education (84:46 - 84:51)
depending on whether you are speaking (84:49 - 84:54)
british english australian english or (84:51 - 84:56)
wait i did it wrong because i never (84:54 - 84:59)
fixed it or american english the words (84:56 - 85:02)
turtle tortoise and terrapin (84:59 - 85:05)
can have somewhat differing meanings (85:02 - 85:09)
even though this one originated in unova (85:05 - 85:11)
you have only been able to capture a (85:09 - 85:14)
live one off the coast of galler (85:11 - 85:17)
americans australians and speakers of (85:14 - 85:19)
british english would all agree that it (85:17 - 85:20)
is a turtle (85:19 - 85:22)
and though its name does not refer to (85:20 - 85:25)
turtles in any even though its name does (85:22 - 85:28)
not refer to turtles in any language (85:25 - 85:30)
it's (85:28 - 85:32)
it's (85:30 - 85:34)
torquel (85:32 - 85:35)
no (85:34 - 85:36)
it's (85:35 - 85:38)
caracosta (85:36 - 85:40)
costa (85:38 - 85:42)
[Music] (85:40 - 85:44)
it is a fossil (85:42 - 85:47)
yeah isn't it a turtle (85:44 - 85:49)
yeah the interesting thing is like in (85:47 - 85:52)
the different languages like for america (85:49 - 85:53)
americans would refer use the word (85:52 - 85:55)
turtle to refer to anything that's a (85:53 - 85:57)
shelled (85:55 - 85:58)
dude (85:57 - 86:00)
where in the uk (85:58 - 86:02)
uh and australia they're like pretty (86:00 - 86:04)
strict that turtles are only in the (86:02 - 86:05)
water (86:04 - 86:06)
oh (86:05 - 86:10)
on land i mean i've i've learned that as (86:06 - 86:15)
well and australians don't have any like (86:10 - 86:19)
water turtles they only have sea turtles (86:15 - 86:22)
good shiny and good shuffle is there any (86:19 - 86:25)
good information (86:22 - 86:25)
uh keracosta and his pre-evolved form (86:26 - 86:30)
are the only fossil pokemon to have rock (86:28 - 86:33)
as their secondary type instead of their (86:30 - 86:37)
primary type (86:33 - 86:37)
i guess i didn't (86:38 - 86:42)
know it was in galler (86:40 - 86:44)
yeah because they released all the (86:42 - 86:46)
fossil pokemon to be roaming around in (86:44 - 86:47)
the (86:46 - 86:50)
uh crown tundra see i never played crown (86:47 - 86:51)
tundra (86:50 - 86:55)
i have it get in there get in there (86:51 - 86:56)
because i was looking i just looked at (86:55 - 86:58)
the original decks because my first (86:56 - 87:00)
thought was tertuga but then i was like (86:58 - 87:02)
that doesn't make sense because (87:00 - 87:04)
well that's the spanish word for turtle (87:02 - 87:07)
and like yeah so that's i mean that it (87:04 - 87:08)
sounds like turtle so it doesn't match (87:07 - 87:10)
the clue so what i had (87:08 - 87:13)
was torquel question mark tertinator (87:10 - 87:14)
question mark but like both of those (87:13 - 87:17)
kind of sound like whatever but torque (87:14 - 87:18)
hole at least doesn't sound like turtle (87:17 - 87:20)
anyway avalog was the other one that i (87:18 - 87:22)
had because it kind of does look like a (87:20 - 87:24)
turtle not from unova but not from unova (87:22 - 87:26)
and then lapras which is also not from (87:24 - 87:28)
unova but could also kind of be maybe a (87:26 - 87:30)
journal i don't know (87:28 - 87:33)
okay all right this week's pokemon (87:30 - 87:34)
