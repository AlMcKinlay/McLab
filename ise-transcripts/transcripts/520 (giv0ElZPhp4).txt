what's the pollinator traffic like (1:24 - 1:30)
pollinator traffic is a buzzin it's it's (1:27 - 1:32)
pretty (1:30 - 1:35)
pretty trafficky today i was out working (1:32 - 1:36)
on a trap (1:35 - 1:37)
earlier (1:36 - 1:39)
and (1:37 - 1:40)
i set up the trap and within like two (1:39 - 1:42)
minutes i already had like five things (1:40 - 1:43)
going through it so (1:42 - 1:46)
dr cody mathis with all of our hot (1:43 - 1:50)
pollinator news yay here i am (1:46 - 1:52)
yes i'm i'm just the resident (1:50 - 1:55)
entomologist slash (1:52 - 1:57)
i thought you were a wildlife biologist (1:55 - 2:00)
not an optimologist (1:57 - 2:02)
you could be both you could be both i (2:00 - 2:06)
have multiple hats (2:02 - 2:09)
so yeah my undergrad was in is in (2:06 - 2:11)
wildlife biology fisheries and wildlife (2:09 - 2:13)
and then uh (2:11 - 2:16)
now my phd is gonna be in entomology so (2:13 - 2:19)
so how do bees and fish relate this is (2:16 - 2:21)
the hot pokemon news (2:19 - 2:24)
so as per a recent ruling in california (2:21 - 2:27)
bees are fish these are fish bees are (2:24 - 2:30)
fish bees are fish (2:27 - 2:30)
technically i'm a marine biologist (2:30 - 2:37)
i am very excited that bees are now fish (2:34 - 2:39)
this is an amazing development of the (2:37 - 2:43)
top 20 22 that we're so lazy that we (2:39 - 2:46)
can't add the word bees to a bill we (2:43 - 2:48)
just decided that bees are fish well the (2:46 - 2:52)
problem is that the invertebrate (2:48 - 2:53)
terrestrial invertebrates are kind of (2:52 - 2:56)
like an orphan taxa like no government (2:53 - 2:58)
takes care of it take it down we try to (2:56 - 3:02)
keep it to a fifth grade level here (2:58 - 3:04)
terrestrial invertebrates means things (3:02 - 3:06)
that don't have spines that walk on (3:04 - 3:07)
earth (3:06 - 3:10)
correct that are not earth that are not (3:07 - 3:12)
in the water so (3:10 - 3:14)
water (3:12 - 3:15)
invertebrates (3:14 - 3:19)
uh are already managed as fish (3:15 - 3:22)
because they are important for fisheries (3:19 - 3:25)
biology and making extremes all healthy (3:22 - 3:26)
and stuff (3:25 - 3:29)
but no one really has jurisdiction over (3:26 - 3:30)
like (3:29 - 3:33)
bees and things like that so (3:30 - 3:35)
when you're trying to pass something to (3:33 - 3:37)
protect bees there's kind of no one to (3:35 - 3:39)
point to so (3:37 - 3:41)
yeah instead of making them their own (3:39 - 3:43)
class they were just like let's just (3:41 - 3:47)
lump them let's just make a fish (3:43 - 3:47)
our usual host steve is not with us this (3:50 - 3:56)
week because (3:54 - 3:57)
he is in (3:56 - 4:00)
germany (3:57 - 4:02)
i guess having adventures as far as he's (4:00 - 4:04)
at mcdonald's right now (4:02 - 4:07)
oh i am not kidding there are mcdonald's (4:04 - 4:10)
in germany as we remember it exists that (4:07 - 4:12)
i'm not surprised (4:10 - 4:14)
at all the big question is what's the (4:12 - 4:17)
german specific food from i didn't at (4:14 - 4:18)
the minute they walked in that (4:17 - 4:21)
mcdonald's i'm out bye (4:18 - 4:23)
chicken (4:21 - 4:28)
dare dare chicken nugget that's yeah (4:23 - 4:30)
i wonder if they have some type of like (4:28 - 4:31)
schnitzel or like some type of like (4:30 - 4:33)
sausage (4:31 - 4:35)
it's gotta be a bratwurst of some sort (4:33 - 4:37)
yeah (4:35 - 4:40)
a mick hot dog dare mick brat yes mick (4:37 - 4:43)
bra there we go i don't know all right (4:40 - 4:46)
so so dr mathis has agreed to sit in (4:43 - 4:48)
while we're covering the podcast to make (4:46 - 4:50)
sure that we get your (4:48 - 4:53)
hot podcast hot and ready on monday (4:50 - 4:57)

steve's allowed to enjoy himself and (4:59 - 5:04)
we're gonna run wild (5:02 - 5:06)
i i'm on the page of mcdonald's (5:04 - 5:08)
specialties from around the world hold (5:06 - 5:12)
on okay (5:08 - 5:12)
there's a (5:12 - 5:15)
there's one for hawaii that doesn't help (5:14 - 5:16)
me (5:15 - 5:18)
okay so while while greg is looking that (5:16 - 5:20)
up i think one thing that we all want to (5:18 - 5:22)
talk about is how it is no longer (5:20 - 5:25)
pride month we have entered (5:22 - 5:27)
months (5:25 - 5:31)
here we are and i am here to ask greg (5:27 - 5:33)
from the people first of all (5:31 - 5:36)

red bubble which okay (5:49 - 5:52)
i i did okay i will say this since red (5:50 - 5:55)
bubble steals everybody's (5:52 - 5:58)
everything and post it i did as much (5:55 - 6:00)
sourcing to try to get back to find the (5:58 - 6:02)
original creator that i could (6:00 - 6:04)
so i did buy it from a person who i (6:02 - 6:07)
think actually made it was the maker i i (6:04 - 6:10)
don't know that for sure but i did i (6:07 - 6:12)
detroit also apparently (6:10 - 6:16)
it's the big vegan ts in germany (6:12 - 6:19)
the big vegan tv's answers to (6:16 - 6:23)
mcvegan the big vegan ts (6:19 - 6:25)
i don't know what that i miss if it's (6:23 - 6:27)
tofu soy (6:25 - 6:28)
no (6:27 - 6:30)
it's (6:28 - 6:31)
trotten (6:30 - 6:34)
schneizer all right here it is (6:31 - 6:36)
the vegan patty is made from soy wheat (6:34 - 6:39)
protein layered on top is lettuce tomato (6:36 - 6:43)
ketchup mustard and crispy onions (6:39 - 6:43)
i would need it because it would make me (6:43 - 6:47)
incredibly ill but (6:45 - 6:51)
all right dr mathis give us your (6:47 - 6:53)
your your thoughts we haven't heard from (6:51 - 6:54)
a lady (6:53 - 6:58)
uh i i'm assuming a lady (6:54 - 7:01)
pronouns she her christ (6:58 - 7:04)
on on scarlet and violet any any hot (7:01 - 7:07)
takes on what you've seen so far (7:04 - 7:08)
um (7:07 - 7:10)
i would say that (7:08 - 7:13)
my biggest hot take is um (7:10 - 7:15)
that (7:13 - 7:17)
i want that grass cat (7:15 - 7:18)
so (7:17 - 7:21)
bad it's brighto (7:18 - 7:23)
cutie little frigatito because i don't (7:21 - 7:25)
want frat boy duck (7:23 - 7:28)
and i don't want i don't i don't know (7:25 - 7:30)
spicy spicy crocodile is really cute but (7:28 - 7:33)
quacksley is not a frat boy yeah i don't (7:30 - 7:35)
see him as a frat boy he's a greaser (7:33 - 7:37)
he's a greaser i mean he was a cute (7:35 - 7:38)
little gay duck when we all thought it (7:37 - 7:40)
was a hat now that he disagrees with her (7:38 - 7:42)
i'm less i'm less in in the questly (7:40 - 7:43)
realm okay (7:42 - 7:46)
yeah um i don't know not super into the (7:43 - 7:49)
duck um (7:46 - 7:50)
it's i mean it comes down to final (7:49 - 7:52)
evolution so i'm gonna need to see final (7:50 - 7:54)
evolutions because if they make (7:52 - 7:56)
another (7:54 - 7:58)
fighting cat i'm gonna be so grumpy (7:56 - 8:00)
i don't we don't need any more fighting (7:58 - 8:03)
cats a fighting grass cat (8:00 - 8:06)
i mean any any cat i mean i think cats (8:03 - 8:08)
fight them that's their whole thing but (8:06 - 8:09)
i don't (8:08 - 8:11)
know cats are fighters not lovers don't (8:09 - 8:14)
wanna i don't know so we'll see i don't (8:11 - 8:16)
i mean what do you all think the final (8:14 - 8:19)
evolutions are gonna be i got no idea (8:16 - 8:22)
okay they're all dragon types in the end (8:19 - 8:24)
yeah there we go (8:22 - 8:26)
what was i thinking that there would be (8:24 - 8:27)
like (8:26 - 8:30)
uh grass fire water (8:27 - 8:33)
grass and (8:30 - 8:33)
fire water fire water yeah (8:35 - 8:40)
they're just gonna twist it that way (8:38 - 8:42)
make it nuts let my dog out so you guys (8:40 - 8:44)
don't have to hear his little peeps go (8:42 - 8:45)
on (8:44 - 8:47)
um (8:45 - 8:49)
yeah so that was the biggest thing is i (8:47 - 8:52)
saw that little cat and i lost my mind (8:49 - 8:54)
um though i also saw badoo or not badou (8:52 - 8:57)
um (8:54 - 8:57)
and lachonk let's talk forever lechok (8:58 - 9:02)
unite (9:01 - 9:05)
yes so i really do like this i like the (9:02 - 9:08)
concept of le chunk becoming like (9:05 - 9:10)
another (9:08 - 9:12)
because the the dragons are obvious like (9:10 - 9:14)
the legendaries are obviously going to (9:12 - 9:16)
become like motorcycles or whatever like (9:14 - 9:18)
a writable thing so i like the idea of (9:16 - 9:21)
le chunk being this series is writable (9:18 - 9:22)
thing and it becomes like a harley (9:21 - 9:27)
davidson like hog (9:22 - 9:27)
no can't say i'm there with you i'm out (9:27 - 9:32)
stay cute lechok (9:30 - 9:35)
stay cute forever he's cute (9:32 - 9:37)
you know it's not yeah (9:35 - 9:39)
if it evolves poorly it will just stay (9:37 - 9:41)
in the chunk forever (9:39 - 9:42)
i think the other thing that jumped out (9:41 - 9:44)
to me was um (9:42 - 9:47)
that i'm not sure (9:44 - 9:49)
how that four person at a time thing is (9:47 - 9:51)
gonna work (9:49 - 9:52)
like i don't know how i'm gonna like (9:51 - 9:55)
that or not well yeah that we can't tell (9:52 - 9:57)
until we actually do it because (9:55 - 9:59)
i'm definitely like i like trading with (9:57 - 10:02)
folks but (9:59 - 10:04)
i'm not a big battle person but i could (10:02 - 10:06)
see how like battling would be cool but (10:04 - 10:08)
other than that i mean i do i think it (10:06 - 10:11)
was mentioned on the podcast um that you (10:08 - 10:12)
could possibly (10:11 - 10:14)
do it where you all come into a game and (10:12 - 10:16)
then you have these timed tasks like (10:14 - 10:19)
catch challenges yeah i think that would (10:16 - 10:21)
be cool (10:19 - 10:24)
i don't know after having beaten arceus (10:21 - 10:25)
uh (10:24 - 10:27)
anything that can be like that would i (10:25 - 10:29)
would love that (10:27 - 10:30)
that's allowed what do you think of the (10:29 - 10:34)
two uh professors (10:30 - 10:34)
in question question marks professors (10:35 - 10:41)
yeah we don't know the professors i i (10:38 - 10:43)
think they're professors (10:41 - 10:48)
um i want to know more of their stories (10:43 - 10:50)
um (10:48 - 10:50)
i i definitely (10:51 - 10:56)
i just i have more questions than i have (10:53 - 10:58)
answers at this point (10:56 - 10:59)
i mean that's appropriate i want more of (10:58 - 11:02)
like their personalities (10:59 - 11:04)
because i definitely did have a little (11:02 - 11:06)
bit of beef with like (11:04 - 11:09)
the the tech suave like guy (11:06 - 11:11)
and then the girl is like kind of wild (11:09 - 11:13)
or whatever and i was just like what (11:11 - 11:16)
what so (11:13 - 11:16)
what what if it turns out that they're (11:16 - 11:20)
actually the leaders of the evil team (11:18 - 11:22)
yeah (11:20 - 11:23)
and it's so frustrating because i would (11:22 - 11:25)
want to be on her team (11:23 - 11:29)
but i'm picking violet (11:25 - 11:29)
so what if she's the enemy (11:30 - 11:33)
she would be my enemy and i don't like (11:31 - 11:36)
that although if they're running skill (11:33 - 11:37)
schools just to fight each other then (11:36 - 11:41)
they're both bad people (11:37 - 11:43)
so i will say if they if they're running (11:41 - 11:46)
schools they are professors but they (11:43 - 11:48)
might not be professors in the way that (11:46 - 11:50)
we classify you know from pokemon oh (11:48 - 11:52)
teaching professors as well research (11:50 - 11:54)
professors correct (11:52 - 11:56)
all right i prepared all these topics (11:54 - 11:58)
ahead of time like i was asked to do and (11:56 - 12:01)
then somebody went in and added more (11:58 - 12:03)
stuff what is going on (12:01 - 12:05)
okay pokemon go news here's your pokemon (12:03 - 12:08)
go news of for the first part (12:05 - 12:11)
what is the wild area event (12:08 - 12:13)
oh so max right back that's not pokemon (12:11 - 12:15)
go that's pokemon (12:13 - 12:16)
we're actually ahead of the curve (12:15 - 12:18)
because they're running it for a week (12:16 - 12:20)
but there is a they've changed the max (12:18 - 12:23)
raid battles in sword and shield (12:20 - 12:25)
until july 10th (12:23 - 12:26)
to (12:25 - 12:28)
celebrate water week so you can get a (12:26 - 12:30)
shiny merrell i just putting it out (12:28 - 12:31)
there because we're actually it's (12:30 - 12:34)
actually not just a weekend (12:31 - 12:36)
but it's up until the 10th so you can go (12:34 - 12:38)
back into sword and shield (12:36 - 12:41)
you can hunt for a shiny merrell (12:38 - 12:43)
i think the odds are what the odds (12:41 - 12:45)
always are (12:43 - 12:47)
whatever cerebri puts it up as like i (12:45 - 12:50)
don't understand their math ever (12:47 - 12:50)
but yes you can get a shiny merrell (12:51 - 12:55)
through the (12:53 - 12:56)
10th of (12:55 - 12:59)
july and this is in max raid battles (12:56 - 13:01)
back trade battles yep (12:59 - 13:03)
do we know why they chose merrell (13:01 - 13:05)
because it's a water type (13:03 - 13:08)
yeah it's just a water tank (13:05 - 13:10)
um it's (13:08 - 13:11)
so the ones that you'll find that are (13:10 - 13:13)
promoted are merrell polly wagons feel (13:11 - 13:16)
but again you only need to check merrell (13:13 - 13:19)
because only merrell can be shiny (13:16 - 13:21)
okay (13:19 - 13:23)
all right and (13:21 - 13:25)
questions about the pokemon go berlin (13:23 - 13:27)
event we can't talk about it yet until (13:25 - 13:30)

afterwards to get a star raptor that (15:21 - 15:27)
knows the fast attack gust (15:23 - 15:29)
and during the event there are three (15:27 - 15:31)
times catch experience two times chance (15:29 - 15:34)
to get starly candy extra large (15:31 - 15:36)
two times candy for catching pokemon (15:34 - 15:38)
lures are extended and senses extended (15:36 - 15:41)
take snapshots for a surprise (15:38 - 15:43)
no one wants it's not a surprise it's (15:41 - 15:45)
just gonna be a starly (15:43 - 15:48)
yeah it's always just the pokemon you're (15:45 - 15:49)
going hey (15:48 - 15:50)
one additional special trade can be done (15:49 - 15:52)
so you can since there's already a boost (15:50 - 15:55)
of an extra one because of the season of (15:52 - 15:58)
go so that'll allow for three a day so (15:55 - 16:00)
that's pretty awesome (15:58 - 16:02)
and then um trades made during the event (16:00 - 16:03)
will um (16:02 - 16:06)
cost half as much to rest so (16:03 - 16:09)
but yeah and as always the bonus for (16:06 - 16:12)
groups (16:09 - 16:12)
will be in place (16:12 - 16:15)
are they going to do that which i never (16:14 - 16:17)
like (16:15 - 16:18)
to extend to raids are they yeah they're (16:17 - 16:20)
doing the sarajevo extender reads again (16:18 - 16:23)
okay (16:20 - 16:25)
still not enough to get me (16:23 - 16:27)
yeah interested (16:25 - 16:30)
yeah i did you guys do the um (16:27 - 16:31)
the other one the (16:30 - 16:35)
drip hydrant yeah so yeah i know (16:31 - 16:38)
the so the here's the exact problem what (16:35 - 16:39)
we thought that was going to be the (16:38 - 16:41)
problem (16:39 - 16:42)
was so we did (16:41 - 16:45)
dino day and will left and so steve and (16:42 - 16:47)
i were there we're like okay well let's (16:45 - 16:48)
see what happens (16:47 - 16:51)
at two when all those wireless raids are (16:48 - 16:54)
supposed to happen and just as we (16:51 - 16:56)
thought (16:54 - 16:58)
there were raids around us but none of (16:56 - 16:59)
them was wireless (16:58 - 17:00)
like (16:59 - 17:02)
it was (17:00 - 17:03)
you would assume that they would flip (17:02 - 17:05)
over someone was like okay well we could (17:03 - 17:06)
walk (17:05 - 17:09)
all the way across minneapolis (17:06 - 17:12)
to try to get one (17:09 - 17:14)
but why would we do that (17:12 - 17:17)
yeah like it it wasn't that not even (17:14 - 17:19)
there wasn't a single gym and you there (17:17 - 17:22)
were a lot over in star uh (17:19 - 17:24)
stone bridge and gold medal park like (17:22 - 17:26)
there were a lot of gyms and there was a (17:24 - 17:27)
gym that had just (17:26 - 17:30)
that was ending that had i forget like (17:27 - 17:31)
i forget what it had into it and we're (17:30 - 17:34)
like okay well let's wait the (17:31 - 17:36)
three minutes for that raid to end to (17:34 - 17:37)
see if it suddenly becomes this wireless (17:36 - 17:39)
no it just went blank and it's not like (17:37 - 17:41)
people weren't playing because we saw (17:39 - 17:43)
tons and tons of people playing in that (17:41 - 17:47)
area it was so i just crowded i like the (17:43 - 17:49)
idea i just think (17:47 - 17:52)
if you're going to make it (17:49 - 17:52)
actually accessible they need to do a (17:52 - 17:59)
bigger switchover it can't be hey drive (17:55 - 18:01)
30 minutes away and then try to get ever (17:59 - 18:04)
because it only spawns in that area it (18:01 - 18:06)
just it felt really (18:04 - 18:08)
sort of like uh here's something you (18:06 - 18:11)
could do (18:08 - 18:12)
and (18:11 - 18:13)
i (18:12 - 18:15)
i mean we've run into this a lot before (18:13 - 18:17)
on go day where the raids just like you (18:15 - 18:19)
have a captive audience why don't you do (18:17 - 18:22)
more five-star raids like why aren't you (18:19 - 18:23)
out there (18:22 - 18:25)
really promoting it so you get people to (18:23 - 18:26)
do (18:25 - 18:28)
good raid battles while everybody's (18:26 - 18:29)
together and (18:28 - 18:31)
this wireless felt that exact same (18:29 - 18:34)
problem like why didn't all of these (18:31 - 18:35)
gems (18:34 - 18:37)
pop (18:35 - 18:38)
like (18:37 - 18:40)
why did why wasn't there one within (18:38 - 18:42)
three miles of us that popped this is (18:40 - 18:46)
wireless range like it just (18:42 - 18:47)
make it like a certain percentage of (18:46 - 18:50)
raids that we're going to pop would be (18:47 - 18:52)
zweiless right yes increase that (18:50 - 18:55)
percentage for well (18:52 - 18:57)
all right (18:55 - 18:59)
nothing we can we can't change the past (18:57 - 19:00)
we can change the best look with hope (18:59 - 19:02)
towards the future but let's talk about (19:00 - 19:03)
the real (19:02 - 19:07)
controversy the real like shocking news (19:03 - 19:10)
controversy that has (19:07 - 19:13)
up in arms over the past week this is an (19:10 - 19:14)
article from (19:13 - 19:18)
comicbook.com written by megan peters on (19:14 - 19:20)
june 29th let me read you a little bit (19:18 - 19:21)
that's what the host normally does on (19:20 - 19:23)
this program (19:21 - 19:26)
pokemon is added again (19:23 - 19:28)
just when you think the ip has done it (19:26 - 19:31)
all with ash ketchum it finds something (19:28 - 19:33)
new to do (19:31 - 19:36)
after plenty of rumors the franchise (19:33 - 19:38)
pulled through for pokemon fans by (19:36 - 19:40)
bringing ash ketchum to a brand new (19:38 - 19:41)
world (19:40 - 19:43)
after all the character has made it into (19:41 - 19:46)
a video game and ash's debut is taking (19:43 - 19:49)
anime fans by storm (19:46 - 19:51)
for those needing more context we've got (19:49 - 19:54)
your back earlier this week code from (19:51 - 19:57)
pokemon masters ex hit social media (19:54 - 20:00)
ahead of a big update and it was there (19:57 - 20:03)
anime fans did a double take after all (20:00 - 20:05)
the data teased ash's arrival to the (20:03 - 20:08)
mobile game and that update has proven (20:05 - 20:10)
correct via cerebe (20:08 - 20:12)
while this is not the first time ash (20:10 - 20:14)
ketchum has appeared in a video game (20:12 - 20:16)
this is his first dedicated entry to a (20:14 - 20:18)
video game (20:16 - 20:20)
the anime protagonist made their video (20:18 - 20:22)
game debut years ago in pokemon puzzle (20:20 - 20:25)
league but ash was never given his own (20:22 - 20:28)
game model in fact the title used jpegs (20:25 - 20:32)
from pokemon anime but ash's new entry (20:28 - 20:34)
is totally different (20:32 - 20:36)
boy did this get the internet up into a (20:34 - 20:38)
store (20:36 - 20:38)
what's the issue greg (20:40 - 20:43)
oh (20:44 - 20:49)
okay okay (20:45 - 20:51)
one of the main complaints is people (20:49 - 20:55)
felt pokemon masters was only pulling (20:51 - 20:56)
pairs (20:55 - 20:59)
from video game series (20:56 - 21:02)
probably forgetting that jesse and james (20:59 - 21:03)
are (21:02 - 21:05)
are in (21:03 - 21:08)
pokemon masters like everybody but okay (21:05 - 21:10)
we'll get to that sidebar because the (21:08 - 21:11)
mental leap people went through about (21:10 - 21:14)
jessie and james as well so people were (21:11 - 21:14)
mad (21:14 - 21:15)
that (21:14 - 21:17)
a (21:15 - 21:20)
non-video game character (21:17 - 21:23)
was being introduced into masters and (21:20 - 21:26)
that ash didn't belong because ash only (21:23 - 21:28)
exists (21:26 - 21:29)
in the anime (21:28 - 21:32)
and quote unquote masters (21:29 - 21:34)
did not (21:32 - 21:36)
have anything that wasn't in a main (21:34 - 21:38)
series game (21:36 - 21:40)
and then of course people went (21:38 - 21:43)
uh jesse and james are in the game yes (21:40 - 21:45)
and people were like no those are jessie (21:43 - 21:49)
and james from pokemon yellow (21:45 - 21:49)
well actually did i you i sent you a (21:50 - 21:55)
screenshot of one twitter thing where it (21:53 - 21:58)
was like this whole thing about how that (21:55 - 22:01)
jesse and james were using different (21:58 - 22:03)
pokemons so that was proof that they (22:01 - 22:06)
weren't the pokemon jesse and james from (22:03 - 22:08)
the anime because they had (22:06 - 22:12)
the sink pairs never have the normals (22:08 - 22:12)
does it matter i mean like just because (22:14 - 22:17)
they've they've only been taking no no (22:15 - 22:19)
no you you can't answer that you can't (22:17 - 22:21)
ask that question because they the the (22:19 - 22:22)
the (22:21 - 22:23)
question if the question is does it (22:22 - 22:26)
matter the answer is always no of course (22:23 - 22:30)
not none of this matters okay (22:26 - 22:30)
because i'm always just the type of (22:30 - 22:33)
person where like i see this kind of (22:31 - 22:35)
stuff on twitter and then i'm like (22:33 - 22:36)
okay (22:35 - 22:37)
and (22:36 - 22:39)
next (22:37 - 22:41)
like moving on (22:39 - 22:43)
but (22:41 - 22:46)
but yeah i don't i mean he's part of (22:43 - 22:49)
yeah you can't have pokemon without like (22:46 - 22:51)
he's one of the main people (22:49 - 22:54)
so people are also upset because red is (22:51 - 22:56)
in the game (22:54 - 22:58)
so they're like (22:56 - 23:00)
upset about it's like having multiple (22:58 - 23:02)
batman's in the game like there are (23:00 - 23:04)
multiple batman's you can have they're (23:02 - 23:06)
like 17 batman's at this point you can (23:04 - 23:11)
have multiple versions of like (23:06 - 23:12)
the gary's in the game people are like (23:11 - 23:14)
oh he's the gym leader gary and i'm like (23:12 - 23:17)
i was like aren't there also like a (23:14 - 23:19)
bunch of a bunch of pairs that are the (23:17 - 23:21)
same trainer but just different pokemon (23:19 - 23:23)
so like (23:21 - 23:23)
look people are upset that ash is in the (23:25 - 23:28)
game and (23:27 - 23:30)
just for (23:28 - 23:32)
they feel like it's i don't know (23:30 - 23:34)
i get the sense of like oh the purity of (23:32 - 23:37)
pokemon masters has been disrupted i'm (23:34 - 23:39)
like tell me that you do not play this (23:37 - 23:41)
game because (23:39 - 23:42)
they have they are (23:41 - 23:44)
way off the ranch at this point also (23:42 - 23:47)
people seem to be confused as to when (23:44 - 23:50)
when could we possibly be getting ash (23:47 - 23:51)
forgetting that the three year (23:50 - 23:55)
anniversary is literally in august (23:51 - 23:57)
now the biggest thing i think (23:55 - 24:02)
out there rumor-wise is they always do a (23:57 - 24:05)
pair you can get for free (24:02 - 24:07)
and people are assuming that ash is (24:05 - 24:09)
going to be the one pair that you don't (24:07 - 24:10)
have to pull for (24:09 - 24:12)
that you'll just you'll be able to play (24:10 - 24:14)
as ash you'll get at the end of the (24:12 - 24:16)
quest or you'll get it right away that (24:14 - 24:18)
you'll just get ash for free for the (24:16 - 24:20)
three year anniversary (24:18 - 24:21)
other people are like what possible (24:20 - 24:23)
pokemon are they gonna give ash and i'm (24:21 - 24:25)
like (24:23 - 24:25)
how is this a question (24:26 - 24:30)
what are they gonna do but another (24:28 - 24:32)
charizard in the game is it's going to (24:30 - 24:33)
be pikachu (24:32 - 24:36)
i imagine yeah (24:33 - 24:38)
like and then they'll be able to do all (24:36 - 24:40)
the sigma suits and (24:38 - 24:42)
give him all the like they'll give him (24:40 - 24:44)
charizard and squirtle with glasses and (24:42 - 24:45)
whatever they want but like in a (24:44 - 24:48)
butterfree yeah it's gonna be ash's (24:45 - 24:50)
pikachu the first one and you're (24:48 - 24:51)
probably gonna get it for free for the (24:50 - 24:55)
three year anniversary which is august (24:51 - 24:57)
25th 26th probably 25th because that's (24:55 - 24:59)
when they do pokemon day in pokemon (24:57 - 25:00)
masters so i'm assuming the third (24:59 - 25:03)
anniversary will hit on the 25th (25:00 - 25:05)
i also think steve brought up that ash (25:03 - 25:07)
greninja is an official pokemon that (25:05 - 25:11)
yeah has been in the game which is yeah (25:07 - 25:14)
people have been angry about that ever (25:11 - 25:17)
since that appeared too so (25:14 - 25:17)
all right other uh postmod (25:18 - 25:21)
so masters news there is two (25:22 - 25:26)
the sink appears that they're running (25:25 - 25:29)
for summer they're bait (25:26 - 25:31)
these are the these are the two bait (25:29 - 25:32)
sink pairs (25:31 - 25:34)
don't pull for these save your money for (25:32 - 25:37)
the three for the third anniversary so i (25:34 - 25:39)
was gonna say five star hilda with (25:37 - 25:42)
grapple locked yeah i mean they're good (25:39 - 25:45)
they're like interesting pairs but they (25:42 - 25:47)
aren't they are the bait pairs (25:45 - 25:50)
they get you to spend your coins before (25:47 - 25:53)
or your gems before the third year (25:50 - 25:57)
because it's n and zoer ark and (25:53 - 25:59)
a shiny isn't it shiny yet shiny (25:57 - 26:03)
shiny grapple lock oh i can't tell (25:59 - 26:03)
i don't even think i ever played masters (26:04 - 26:10)
i played it for (26:08 - 26:12)
like a few weeks and i was like i hate (26:10 - 26:14)
that this game screams at me every time (26:12 - 26:17)
i open it no i'm done what do you mean (26:14 - 26:18)
it screams at you oh there was some (26:17 - 26:21)
audio thing that would go off when you (26:18 - 26:23)
opened it and i was like oh this is i (26:21 - 26:24)
don't know these things because i never (26:23 - 26:27)
have my sound on my phone it is (26:24 - 26:29)
permanently on silent not me (26:27 - 26:31)
yeah (26:29 - 26:33)
all right i think this is a good place (26:31 - 26:35)
for us to take a break and then we will (26:33 - 26:38)
come back with some more pokemon news (26:35 - 26:39)
after the break (26:38 - 26:43)
and we are back from our break (26:39 - 26:45)
what was the question that we had over (26:43 - 26:46)
the break you had a question for me and (26:45 - 26:49)
greg doctor (26:46 - 26:51)
oh i (26:49 - 26:56)
uh wanted to express my ire (26:51 - 27:00)
there we go about b pokemon (26:56 - 27:02)
oh yes (27:00 - 27:05)
so there are no b's there are no (27:02 - 27:07)
be (27:05 - 27:07)
i don't see what the issue is here so (27:20 - 27:23)
it's not it's not because it's the whole (27:22 - 27:24)
square is a rectangle but a rectangle is (27:23 - 27:27)
not a square like same that's like so (27:24 - 27:29)
it's not it doesn't go both ways no that (27:27 - 27:31)
is depends on how your dimensions are (27:29 - 27:34)
operating okay what makes a bee a bee (27:31 - 27:35)
you got (27:34 - 27:37)
hair you've got a lot of hair and the (27:35 - 27:39)
hair has to be branched (27:37 - 27:42)
it's got a bit of breath (27:39 - 27:43)
so instead of like a single like our (27:42 - 27:46)
hair is like a single strand right but (27:43 - 27:48)
bees their hair has little branches to (27:46 - 27:50)
it kind of like things like a feather (27:48 - 27:52)
like it's like plumed (27:50 - 27:55)
um and that helps retain pollen because (27:52 - 27:56)
as we all know (27:55 - 27:59)
as everyone that's listening obviously (27:56 - 28:00)
everybody knows this everybody knows (27:59 - 28:02)
this about 100 million years ago bees (28:00 - 28:03)
evolved (28:02 - 28:05)
wasps which were carnivores and they (28:03 - 28:07)
basically just went vegetarian and (28:05 - 28:08)
started eating pollen and nectar from (28:07 - 28:10)
flowers (28:08 - 28:12)
and that's how bees became bees (28:10 - 28:16)
what at what point did bees get gills (28:12 - 28:18)
um along (28:16 - 28:20)
2022. you have to ask yeah 2022 we'd (28:18 - 28:24)
have to ask california state about that (28:20 - 28:29)
so wait the bees evolved from wasps (28:24 - 28:31)
because they wanted to be vegetarians (28:29 - 28:34)
they were accessing a new resource and (28:31 - 28:35)
now in (28:34 - 28:36)
today (28:35 - 28:38)
2022 (28:36 - 28:42)
bees are an endangered species (28:38 - 28:44)
while wasps are having no problems (28:42 - 28:46)
whatsoever (28:44 - 28:52)
so there are 20 there aren't one (28:46 - 28:52)
don't (28:52 - 28:57)
become a vegan (28:53 - 28:57)
or you won't be caught or you'll you'll (28:57 - 29:01)
be classified as a fish and then slowly (28:59 - 29:03)
be killed (29:01 - 29:05)
i mean it makes them less robust like it (29:03 - 29:08)
makes them more easy to go extinct (29:05 - 29:09)
because they are (29:08 - 29:12)
they can't eat yeah i guess (29:09 - 29:15)
they they rely on a more delicate (29:12 - 29:18)
uh aspect of the ecosystem (29:15 - 29:18)
tying this back to pokemon all of the (29:19 - 29:23)
pokemon everyone thinks of when they (29:21 - 29:25)
think of a bee (29:23 - 29:28)
they're all lost (29:25 - 29:28)
and it basically just continues the (29:28 - 29:33)
the fire (29:32 - 29:35)
that people have of this big fear of (29:33 - 29:37)
wasps of bees they think that beezers (29:35 - 29:39)
out to get them because they tie them in (29:37 - 29:42)
with wasps and specif specifically with (29:39 - 29:44)
like social wasps like yellow jackets (29:42 - 29:46)
like every nine times out of ten if (29:44 - 29:47)
someone says that they've been stung by (29:46 - 29:50)
a bee they've been stung by a wasp and (29:47 - 29:52)
they are negatively attributing that to (29:50 - 29:54)
a bee yeah but nobody ever says i'm (29:52 - 29:56)
allergic to wasps they only say i'm (29:54 - 29:58)
allergic to bee stings yeah because the (29:56 - 30:00)
bee sting uh they have venom that (29:58 - 30:02)
they'll inject into you (30:00 - 30:06)
yeah so goodbye bees yeah so they're not (30:02 - 30:08)
so they're not very friendly now are (30:06 - 30:10)
they that's only (30:08 - 30:12)
uh apis melithera which is the european (30:10 - 30:14)
honeybee and that is a bead that's (30:12 - 30:16)
actually not native to north america (30:14 - 30:19)
so there are four thousand other other (30:16 - 30:21)
bees and this is starting to sound like (30:19 - 30:23)
that dude who didn't think that the (30:21 - 30:25)
jesse and james that were in pokemon (30:23 - 30:27)
masters ex were the same jesse and james (30:25 - 30:30)
as the one well actually because the (30:27 - 30:32)
type that it's using is from a different (30:30 - 30:35)
continent it's not actually accused all (30:32 - 30:37)
i'm saying is that (30:35 - 30:40)
i know they have the capability (30:37 - 30:41)
for me (30:40 - 30:44)
burmese a bag worm that evolves (30:41 - 30:46)
depending and that that's how it happens (30:44 - 30:48)
like like it evolves into two things and (30:46 - 30:50)
that's how it happens in nature if it's (30:48 - 30:51)
male it becomes one thing if it's female (30:50 - 30:54)
so they they have the capacity is it to (30:51 - 30:55)
have accurate (30:54 - 30:58)
things that what is the scientific name (30:55 - 31:01)
for bees it's like aponids or something (30:58 - 31:04)
um and enthofala would be one of them so (31:01 - 31:05)
there's (31:04 - 31:07)
are you thinking of apenny (31:05 - 31:08)
maybe (31:07 - 31:10)
that's the family yeah fine (31:08 - 31:14)
do that there's one family (31:10 - 31:14)
what's what is it an apiary where you (31:14 - 31:18)
keep the bees (31:16 - 31:20)
yes okay (31:18 - 31:22)
point taken (31:20 - 31:24)
that's so but that's because it's one (31:22 - 31:28)
species that is either way do they maybe (31:24 - 31:31)
not have those kinds of bees (31:28 - 31:33)
in japan (31:31 - 31:35)
and that's why they don't know about (31:33 - 31:37)
them to put them in the pokemon yes (31:35 - 31:39)
japan knows nothing about the rest of (31:37 - 31:41)
the world yeah i don't think they have (31:39 - 31:42)
like bag worms everywhere has got bag (31:41 - 31:44)
worms (31:42 - 31:46)
right over here i have an important now (31:44 - 31:48)
that now that you have stated that bees (31:46 - 31:50)
have venom (31:48 - 31:53)
yes should scarlet violet have a bee (31:50 - 31:56)
that is a bug poison type (31:53 - 31:56)
it could they could they could have one (31:57 - 32:02)
but i'm i'm trying to advocate that we (32:00 - 32:04)
need (32:02 - 32:07)
uh one that that people think is cute (32:04 - 32:09)
because he's accurate rosalia is (32:07 - 32:11)
gorgeous and that's a grass poison (32:09 - 32:12)
tonight (32:11 - 32:15)
bubba is the point (32:12 - 32:17)
okay (32:15 - 32:18)
i'm just saying we need they i know that (32:17 - 32:20)
they have the capability of having an (32:18 - 32:22)
entomologically accurate (32:20 - 32:23)
bug (32:22 - 32:26)
but why is why not a bee i'm i'm just (32:23 - 32:29)
looking we can't (32:26 - 32:29)
i do i do i am curious i know that we (32:30 - 32:35)
all were big fans of the bug pokemon in (32:32 - 32:36)
um (32:35 - 32:39)
wait and why isn't combi (32:36 - 32:41)
and vespa quinn so combi looks like it's (32:39 - 32:44)
like a honeycomb yeah it's not a bee (32:41 - 32:46)
it's like a honeycomb and it evolves (32:44 - 32:48)
into a wasp (32:46 - 32:51)
it evolves into the vessel of vespa (32:48 - 32:54)
vespa is means wasp (32:51 - 32:58)
is a scooter in italy yes it's a wasp (32:54 - 32:59)
that your boyfriend drives while you (32:58 - 33:03)
ride on the back ciao (32:59 - 33:03)
anyway that's my rant that's my rant (33:03 - 33:08)
let's get back to the news all right so (33:06 - 33:10)
our less controversial news topic of the (33:08 - 33:12)
week here i'm going to read this is from (33:10 - 33:14)

pokemon go maker niantic cancels (33:21 - 33:28)
multiple projects lays off staff (33:24 - 33:29)
here we go (33:28 - 33:32)
pokemon and pikmin bloom maker niantic (33:29 - 33:35)
is cutting costs and cancelling games (33:32 - 33:37)
according to a new report from bloomberg (33:35 - 33:39)
the augmented reality technology and (33:37 - 33:41)
game maker is shedding eight percent of (33:39 - 33:43)
its staff and scrapping four in (33:41 - 33:46)
development projects that includes two (33:43 - 33:50)
previously announced efforts the ar game (33:46 - 33:52)
transformers heavy metal and a (33:50 - 33:54)
collaboration with theater company punch (33:52 - 33:56)
drunk known for its immersive play sleep (33:54 - 33:57)
no more (33:56 - 33:59)
bloomberg reported wednesday that (33:57 - 34:02)
niantic ceo john hanke told employees in (33:59 - 34:04)
an email that the company was facing a (34:02 - 34:06)
time of economic turmoil and was looking (34:04 - 34:10)
to rein in costs niantic is best known (34:06 - 34:12)
for its hit mobile game pokemon go a (34:10 - 34:15)
successor to its debut augmented reality (34:12 - 34:18)
title ingress launched in 2016 pokemon (34:15 - 34:20)
go was and continues to be a hit for (34:18 - 34:23)
niantic and was the fifth highest (34:20 - 34:26)
grossing mobile game in the u.s in 2021 (34:23 - 34:28)
according to research firm sensor tower (34:26 - 34:30)
niantic has attempted to replicate (34:28 - 34:32)
pokemons go success with other popular (34:30 - 34:35)
properties in summer 2019 the company (34:32 - 34:37)
launched harry potter wizards unite (34:35 - 34:39)
but it failed to catch on the way (34:37 - 34:41)
pokemon go did (34:39 - 34:42)
two years after the wizard world games (34:41 - 34:44)
launch niantic announced it would be (34:42 - 34:46)
shut down (34:44 - 34:48)
niantic later teamed up with nintendo (34:46 - 34:51)
for pikmin bloom a mobile game that was (34:48 - 34:52)
modest (34:51 - 34:54)
was a modest success and reportedly (34:52 - 34:57)
generated only 5 million in revenue a (34:54 - 35:00)
far cry from pokemon go's billions in (34:57 - 35:01)
earnings (35:00 - 35:02)
based on bloomberg's reporting it (35:01 - 35:04)
appears that niantic will continue to (35:02 - 35:06)
move forward with the recently announced (35:04 - 35:10)
nba all-world a free-to-play game where (35:06 - 35:12)
players collect nba stars buff and (35:10 - 35:15)
customize them with items picked up from (35:12 - 35:18)
visits to real world locations and take (35:15 - 35:20)
on other players in one-on-one matches (35:18 - 35:22)
at their neighborhood courts and other (35:20 - 35:24)
locations (35:22 - 35:26)
niantic also has an original virtual pet (35:24 - 35:30)
game peridot in development which it has (35:26 - 35:32)
already swapped launched and plans to (35:30 - 35:35)
release more widely this year (35:32 - 35:38)
well uh (35:35 - 35:42)
let's start from the top i guess boy so (35:38 - 35:44)
they're cutting costs and canceling (35:42 - 35:46)
games (35:44 - 35:47)
um (35:46 - 35:48)
they shouldn't have got written get (35:47 - 35:50)
ridden rid of remote raid passes that's (35:48 - 35:52)
all i'm saying they haven't gotten rid (35:50 - 35:54)
of remote raid passes up the price i (35:52 - 35:57)
mean but they j they shouldn't (35:54 - 35:59)
they shouldn't (35:57 - 35:59)
they are dropping 85 to 90 jobs so we (36:00 - 36:04)
can kind of (36:03 - 36:06)
say it's eight percent we can (36:04 - 36:08)
kind of guess how big niantic is yeah (36:06 - 36:13)
that's problem one number two (36:08 - 36:13)
facing a time of economic (36:13 - 36:19)
turmoil is business speak for our board (36:16 - 36:22)
of directors wants more profits (36:19 - 36:24)
because in all honesty they generated (36:22 - 36:29)
1.2 billion dollars in 2021 (36:24 - 36:29)
which was their best year on record like (36:29 - 36:36)
it was slightly down from 2020 but (36:33 - 36:38)
it's hard to look at companies that can (36:36 - 36:40)
say we're making money in the billions (36:38 - 36:42)
and then take their we're facing (36:40 - 36:46)
economic turmoil at face value (36:42 - 36:47)
generally it is (36:46 - 36:50)
they are their stock or the board isn't (36:47 - 36:51)
getting (36:50 - 36:54)
the profit revenue generation that they (36:51 - 36:55)
see (36:54 - 36:57)
and that's usually comes at the expense (36:55 - 36:59)
of (36:57 - 37:02)
projects that they don't think based off (36:59 - 37:03)
of (37:02 - 37:05)
what has come before will suddenly be a (37:03 - 37:07)
huge hit like they can look at (37:05 - 37:09)
transformers and look at harry potter (37:07 - 37:11)
and say okay they're very similar games (37:09 - 37:13)
harry potter didn't go well this (37:11 - 37:16)
probably won't go well (37:13 - 37:17)
either (37:16 - 37:19)
and transformers doesn't nearly have the (37:17 - 37:21)
world presence (37:19 - 37:24)
that harry potter did so if you're going (37:21 - 37:25)
to the board and saying (37:24 - 37:27)
what products are going to generate us (37:25 - 37:28)
the most money (37:27 - 37:30)
these ain't it and they're going to cut (37:28 - 37:31)
them (37:30 - 37:34)
i i have a slightly different point of (37:31 - 37:35)
view (37:34 - 37:38)
um just coming from the understanding (37:35 - 37:40)
which (37:38 - 37:42)
everyone should be aware of maybe to (37:40 - 37:45)
people listening in the far future (37:42 - 37:49)
hello 2075 (37:45 - 37:49)
we're saying hello are there bees are (37:49 - 37:53)
there beasts (37:52 - 37:56)
do the bees exist any longer (37:53 - 37:58)
i mean it's it's very clear (37:56 - 38:02)
that economically this country um and (37:58 - 38:05)
probably in some level to on a worldwide (38:02 - 38:06)
scale (38:05 - 38:08)
we're in a very (38:06 - 38:12)
inflationary re recession oriented (38:08 - 38:13)
economy (38:12 - 38:14)
and (38:13 - 38:17)
i will agree with greg (38:14 - 38:19)
on one level that (38:17 - 38:21)
there is probably a (38:19 - 38:25)
large drive to maintain a certain profit (38:21 - 38:26)
margin (38:25 - 38:29)
not necessarily create more profit but (38:26 - 38:32)
just recognizing that the value of the (38:29 - 38:35)
individual dollar is going down (38:32 - 38:36)
and (38:35 - 38:40)
most investment is shifting away from (38:36 - 38:44)
commodities out of markets and into (38:40 - 38:47)
savings types things bonds (38:44 - 38:50)
there's not a company (38:47 - 38:53)
in the world that doesn't want them to (38:50 - 38:55)
increase more profits there's not a (38:53 - 38:57)
company out there that's like keep it at (38:55 - 38:58)
these levels well no i'm just saying (38:57 - 39:00)
they have to do this to preserve (38:58 - 39:04)
right a profit level at minimum because (39:00 - 39:06)
the highest expense for any (39:04 - 39:08)
cody you'll never learn this because (39:06 - 39:09)
you'll be in edu (39:08 - 39:12)
academics for your entire life (39:09 - 39:16)
highest expense for any actual business (39:12 - 39:17)
enterprise (39:16 - 39:18)
is (39:17 - 39:19)
staff (39:18 - 39:23)
yeah that that salaries plus the cost of (39:19 - 39:26)
benefits is always the highest (39:23 - 39:28)
expense (39:26 - 39:30)
if they need to (39:28 - 39:33)
lean out expenses (39:30 - 39:36)
they are going to shed staff (39:33 - 39:36)
that's (39:36 - 39:39)
that's the sad nature and (39:36 - 39:42)
i mean one of the nice things for (39:39 - 39:44)
people like me and dr mathis who work in (39:42 - 39:48)
academia is uh universities tend to (39:44 - 39:49)
uh (39:48 - 39:52)
be very like (39:49 - 39:55)
they want to hold on to people (39:52 - 39:57)
well number one thing (39:55 - 39:59)
faculty and universities have contracts (39:57 - 40:01)
so you can't just fire them (39:59 - 40:04)
but generally universities that aren't (40:01 - 40:05)
uh (40:04 - 40:06)
public (40:05 - 40:09)
education like state universities tend (40:06 - 40:11)
to want to retain their staff and do as (40:09 - 40:13)
much as possible to retain staff (40:11 - 40:17)
but private companies (40:13 - 40:18)
see (40:17 - 40:21)
staff as uh the the current term is (40:18 - 40:23)
human capital (40:21 - 40:26)
and it's like we've got (40:23 - 40:29)
we've got to get rid of people in order (40:26 - 40:31)
to reduce expenses (40:29 - 40:35)
yeah and also i guarantee they want (40:31 - 40:38)
to cut out as many (40:35 - 40:40)
parties that they have to pay like (40:38 - 40:43)
transformers isn't their ip (40:40 - 40:44)
true and (40:43 - 40:46)
what's also (40:44 - 40:49)
very notable about that is (40:46 - 40:52)
transformers is is hasbro (40:49 - 40:55)
yeah i'm pretty certain and hasbro (40:52 - 40:57)
it's like (40:55 - 40:59)
man (40:57 - 40:59)
i wish i could take you kids yeah you (40:59 - 41:05)
guys back to the 70s and 80s when there (41:02 - 41:07)
were a lot of different companies (41:05 - 41:10)
that made things (41:07 - 41:10)
but now hasbro has bought everybody (41:11 - 41:17)
yeah and there's no way that hasbro did (41:15 - 41:19)
not want a huge party oh yeah yeah (41:17 - 41:22)
absolutely and i like i'm i'm sure with (41:19 - 41:25)
pokemon go right the one thing that (41:22 - 41:27)
steve keeps reminding us is (41:25 - 41:29)
uh tpci the pokemon company (41:27 - 41:31)
international (41:29 - 41:32)
um (41:31 - 41:34)
has the final say (41:32 - 41:37)
and i'm sure they have a good financial (41:34 - 41:39)
stake in the profits that come out of (41:37 - 41:40)
pokemon go (41:39 - 41:43)
if a transformers game were to come (41:40 - 41:46)
alive i'm sure hasbro (41:43 - 41:48)
would want a huge financial stake (41:46 - 41:50)
and (41:48 - 41:52)
if we're looking at a time when the (41:50 - 41:53)
economy is not going to be able to (41:52 - 41:55)
support (41:53 - 41:56)
a lot of mobile (41:55 - 41:58)
transactions (41:56 - 42:00)
you know because (41:58 - 42:01)
the (42:00 - 42:03)
the cost of mobile transactions can't (42:01 - 42:05)
fluctuate like you're (42:03 - 42:07)
sadly the cost of your groceries at the (42:05 - 42:09)
grocery store (42:07 - 42:11)
right (42:09 - 42:12)
if they if they keep changing the price (42:11 - 42:14)
of things in your mobile games every (42:12 - 42:16)
week you're gonna stop playing that game (42:14 - 42:18)
yeah right (42:16 - 42:20)
i think the big like one thing that (42:18 - 42:21)
jumps out to me here is the discussion (42:20 - 42:23)
of like basically like (42:21 - 42:26)
like the parent companies that own these (42:23 - 42:27)
ips (42:26 - 42:29)
then how did nba (42:27 - 42:31)
make the cut (42:29 - 42:33)
like why is that (42:31 - 42:36)
because i know like all the nba games (42:33 - 42:38)
that are made there's like a (42:36 - 42:41)
somewhat toxic environment there as well (42:38 - 42:44)
of like the individual stars no longer (42:41 - 42:46)
own (42:44 - 42:49)
themselves yeah they're um (42:46 - 42:52)
so like how how did that make it (42:49 - 42:54)
is that that is a good point but the (42:52 - 42:58)
thing about the mba and especially (42:54 - 43:00)
digital mba (42:58 - 43:02)
it's it's not something like i i just (43:00 - 43:04)
don't think that there's a good overlap (43:02 - 43:07)
the venn diagram of (43:04 - 43:10)
like nba collector super fans and (43:07 - 43:12)
pokemon super fans there's just not as (43:10 - 43:14)
much overlap but (43:12 - 43:17)
the originator of nfts (43:14 - 43:21)
was the nba like the popularity of nafts (43:17 - 43:25)
that they were selling clips of games (43:21 - 43:28)
and people were buying them up (43:25 - 43:30)
so (43:28 - 43:30)
like that is a very clearly identified (43:32 - 43:39)
area where people they (43:36 - 43:41)
they know people will spend money (43:39 - 43:44)
okay right and if i'm gonna i don't even (43:41 - 43:45)
know who the (43:44 - 43:49)
steph curry is that a is that an mba (43:45 - 43:50)
because it's like (43:49 - 43:52)
i don't know i know the people i went to (43:50 - 43:55)
school with i know michael jordan (43:52 - 43:58)
i know steph curry but michael jordan is (43:55 - 44:01)
like so far out of it now he's not he's (43:58 - 44:03)
not an nba but i'm saying like golfing (44:01 - 44:05)
and stuff yeah if you could have a video (44:03 - 44:08)
game bo jackson does he was he an nba (44:05 - 44:10)
steph curry is one you're correct there (44:08 - 44:12)
nba (44:10 - 44:14)
i mean i don't think alonzo morning who (44:12 - 44:16)
i went to school with is in nba anymore (44:14 - 44:18)
i think he's retired (44:16 - 44:21)
um (44:18 - 44:21)
kevin garnett shaquille o'neal these are (44:21 - 44:27)
all stars yeah dikembe mutombo did he (44:23 - 44:28)
mba (44:27 - 44:30)
oh man it made me either way (44:28 - 44:33)
the concept of like owning or having (44:30 - 44:37)
your favorite nba player in a game (44:33 - 44:39)
and then using that interactively i (44:37 - 44:41)
think has a very (44:39 - 44:43)
like an appeal that we don't recognize (44:41 - 44:45)
because we just don't care about sports (44:43 - 44:48)
ball (44:45 - 44:52)
well i didn't realize that (44:48 - 44:52)
nba is now second like nba passed (44:53 - 44:57)
baseball (44:56 - 44:59)
like yeah because baseball's boring as (44:57 - 45:03)
heck football is here (44:59 - 45:05)
and always will be here and nba is now (45:03 - 45:07)
here about half i mean they're huge they (45:05 - 45:09)
make a ton of money (45:07 - 45:11)
and they're the second most (45:09 - 45:14)
popular sport in america so when you're (45:11 - 45:17)
looking at ips that a generate a ton of (45:14 - 45:21)
money that have a huge install base (45:17 - 45:22)
you're going to look at saying like yeah (45:21 - 45:24)
these people have already proven that (45:22 - 45:26)
they're going to pay a lot of money to (45:24 - 45:28)
have (45:26 - 45:31)
images and cards and blah blah blah of (45:28 - 45:34)
their favorite you know (45:31 - 45:36)
you get to wear that person's jersey (45:34 - 45:38)
like that is already a built-in fan base (45:36 - 45:40)
that has proven that they will spend (45:38 - 45:43)
money to look like their favorite (45:40 - 45:45)
nba star (45:43 - 45:48)
um and i don't think (45:45 - 45:50)
properties like transformers have that (45:48 - 45:51)
draw (45:50 - 45:55)
across so many people and the thing also (45:51 - 45:56)
right (45:55 - 45:58)
transformers i know people who are (45:56 - 46:01)
younger than me who enjoy transformers (45:58 - 46:02)
but (46:01 - 46:04)
they'd have to be launching this game in (46:02 - 46:06)
1989 (46:04 - 46:10)
yeah to really hit that first wave of (46:06 - 46:12)
transformers when the movies hit they (46:10 - 46:14)
don't have a new movie coming out and (46:12 - 46:16)
not any for the foreseeable future (46:14 - 46:20)
so i just linked uh it for you guys uh (46:16 - 46:23)
the site for mba top shot that is the (46:20 - 46:26)
name of the uh mba nfts and they're (46:23 - 46:28)
basically sold like trading cards for (46:26 - 46:30)
folks who haven't heard of this before (46:28 - 46:33)
and what you get is (46:30 - 46:36)
ownership of a video clip from an nba (46:33 - 46:38)
game (46:36 - 46:40)
you don't you you don't you don't know (46:38 - 46:42)
what it is you just it's a it's their (46:40 - 46:44)
moments is what they're called (46:42 - 46:45)
and (46:44 - 46:48)
you it's just like buying trading cards (46:45 - 46:51)
and you might get a super popular (46:48 - 46:53)
in-demand player (46:51 - 46:55)
a video clip of an in-demand player (46:53 - 46:59)
doing something amazing or you might not (46:55 - 46:59)
but these have been around for a long (47:00 - 47:04)
time (47:03 - 47:07)
a relatively long time (47:04 - 47:09)
what is the name of the cars that had (47:07 - 47:12)
the motion in it that like you moved it (47:09 - 47:15)
like holographic cards yeah (47:12 - 47:16)
just go back to that please get (47:15 - 47:19)
something in your hand this is digital (47:16 - 47:22)
nobody wants anything physical either (47:19 - 47:24)
yeah don't don't mind me i'm just trying (47:22 - 47:26)
to figure out how to digitally (47:24 - 47:29)
nft my bees oh with pictures of my bees (47:26 - 47:32)
so that i can make money today (47:29 - 47:34)
you could tag bees and sell individual (47:32 - 47:36)
tags this is your bee (47:34 - 47:37)
i have (47:36 - 47:39)
i have like a bunch of (47:37 - 47:42)
like sorry for audio listeners but i (47:39 - 47:45)
have insects that i have tagged like (47:42 - 47:47)
here no no no you gotta keep you've got (47:45 - 47:49)
to keep them alive (47:47 - 47:52)
somehow but here's here's here's your (47:49 - 47:53)
your hot deal (47:52 - 47:55)
if you can develop a proprietary (47:53 - 47:57)
technology that you can tag a bee that (47:55 - 47:59)
it will stay alive (47:57 - 48:01)
oh yeah no and then (47:59 - 48:04)
you sell that as an nft (48:01 - 48:06)
and then people can log into their nft (48:04 - 48:09)
to see what the b is up to like where is (48:06 - 48:12)
it on the map right now geolocate it (48:09 - 48:15)
they don't last that long (48:12 - 48:17)
stop saying that you're undercutting (48:15 - 48:19)
your business model (48:17 - 48:21)
we can figure this out we can okay cool (48:19 - 48:24)
i will say props to uh (48:21 - 48:25)
in (48:24 - 48:28)
they get a half props at mba for (48:25 - 48:29)
um (48:28 - 48:34)
actually doing wnba nfts as well uh (48:29 - 48:36)
i'm not sure i don't think the wnba ones (48:34 - 48:38)
have been around as long i could be (48:36 - 48:39)
wrong (48:38 - 48:43)
but i do appreciate that both leagues (48:39 - 48:45)
are represented (48:43 - 48:47)
there yeah there were a couple uh on the (48:45 - 48:48)
top (48:47 - 48:51)
like list right now that were from wnba (48:48 - 48:53)
and they were selling for quite a lot so (48:51 - 48:56)
like in comparison to the (48:53 - 48:59)
men's so what if they were to make it so (48:56 - 49:01)
that um if you (48:59 - 49:03)
good lord (49:01 - 49:06)
i'm sorry this website is so distracting (49:03 - 49:07)
it really is (49:06 - 49:09)
very very distracting i got off of it (49:07 - 49:11)
real quick you can get you can get (49:09 - 49:15)
brianna stewart for 16 man um (49:11 - 49:18)
but what if they were to integrate nba (49:15 - 49:20)
top shot with (49:18 - 49:21)
their (49:20 - 49:23)
ar game (49:21 - 49:26)
and like if you owned a particular (49:23 - 49:28)
player in nba top shot then you could (49:26 - 49:29)
have them (49:28 - 49:31)
either have them in your game or if you (49:29 - 49:32)
got them in your game that you got a (49:31 - 49:37)
buff because you own the nft for them (49:32 - 49:37)
i'm looking to see if that's mentioned (49:38 - 49:41)
in the (49:40 - 49:45)
in the article about nba at all here's (49:41 - 49:46)
what okay i'm gonna take a side note (49:45 - 49:48)
what bums me about the fact that they're (49:46 - 49:50)
canceling the punch drunk thing (49:48 - 49:52)
it was gonna be hamlet they're gonna do (49:50 - 49:54)
some sort of cool interactive hamlet (49:52 - 49:56)
thing in the world and now we're gonna (49:54 - 49:58)
get to see what that was i want to (49:56 - 50:02)
collect waterlogged ophelia (49:58 - 50:02)
so and then like the other (50:04 - 50:09)
two games that are mentioned here in (50:07 - 50:11)
this article first of all this first of (50:09 - 50:14)
all every time they talk about harry (50:11 - 50:16)
potter wizards unite and how it didn't (50:14 - 50:17)
go well (50:16 - 50:19)
i get real grumpy because it was their (50:17 - 50:21)
own fault like they made it too (50:19 - 50:23)
complicated oh yeah absolutely they made (50:21 - 50:25)
that game because i wanted to play that (50:23 - 50:27)
game so bad (50:25 - 50:28)
and i was like if this was just a little (50:27 - 50:31)
bit less complicated i would play it so (50:28 - 50:33)
you can't point to the peop to the (50:31 - 50:35)
players and be like well no one likes it (50:33 - 50:37)
and like yeah make it less complicated (50:35 - 50:38)
like (50:37 - 50:42)
make it something that i don't have to (50:38 - 50:43)
like (50:42 - 50:46)
be playing for an hour at a time every (50:43 - 50:49)
day or else i'm losing something like (50:46 - 50:50)
so (50:49 - 50:51)
real grumpy about that it gives me real (50:50 - 50:54)
firefly vibes if anyone is a firefly fan (50:51 - 50:57)
where there's nobody's a firefly flannel (50:54 - 50:59)
the tv show firefly (50:57 - 51:03)
i lost my ability to speak firefly fan a (50:59 - 51:05)
firefly flan is a delicious mexican (51:03 - 51:08)
dessert how the the (51:05 - 51:10)
television station fox that it was on (51:08 - 51:13)
like they kept changing the date so like (51:10 - 51:15)
the first week it was on tuesdays at (51:13 - 51:17)
nine and then the second week it was on (51:15 - 51:19)
thursday thursday at seven and they like (51:17 - 51:21)
changed all of these things so all the (51:19 - 51:23)
air dates change like week to week was (51:21 - 51:25)
it also firefly that they showed them (51:23 - 51:27)
out of order yes so they showed the (51:25 - 51:29)
second episode first and then they (51:27 - 51:31)
showed the first episode and so it's and (51:29 - 51:33)
then fox was like no no no one likes (51:31 - 51:34)
this show so let's just cancel it and (51:33 - 51:36)
it's just like excuse me and it was (51:34 - 51:38)
before the time of you could just watch (51:36 - 51:40)
whatever show you wanted to watch (51:38 - 51:41)
whenever you want to watch it (51:40 - 51:45)
it was when you actually had two kids (51:41 - 51:48)
fellow kids when you actually had to be (51:45 - 51:50)
there at the time of playing and they (51:48 - 51:51)
didn't have they didn't have replays or (51:50 - 51:53)
anything so if you missed it there (51:51 - 51:55)
wasn't like a website you could go to to (51:53 - 51:57)
watch it or anything you just missed (51:55 - 51:59)
that episode (51:57 - 52:02)
and they kept changing yeah and so that (51:59 - 52:04)
that's how that's how i feel about harry (52:02 - 52:06)
potter wizards unite like same deal like (52:04 - 52:08)
you messed it up and now you can't be (52:06 - 52:09)
blaming us (52:08 - 52:11)
because if you fixed it i would play it (52:09 - 52:13)
and the second thing i would say niantic (52:11 - 52:15)
if you you can take pikmin bloom out of (52:13 - 52:17)
my cold dead (52:15 - 52:19)
hands what do you mean i've already (52:17 - 52:22)
uninstalled it oh i love it now now my (52:19 - 52:24)
favorite thing about this (52:22 - 52:27)
uh bloomberg article (52:24 - 52:29)
is (52:27 - 52:31)
in 2019 it launched harry potter wizard (52:29 - 52:33)
nights which failed to find an audience (52:31 - 52:34)
and shut down earlier this year games (52:33 - 52:37)
based on the board game catan and (52:34 - 52:39)
nintendo series pikmin were also (52:37 - 52:41)
unsuccessful (52:39 - 52:43)
like have we determined that pikmin is (52:41 - 52:45)
unsuccessful oh no it is because (52:43 - 52:47)
nobody's buying anything because the (52:45 - 52:49)
game doesn't sell you anything yeah what (52:47 - 52:51)
do you buy (52:49 - 52:53)
incubators (52:51 - 52:54)
um you can buy (52:53 - 52:57)
the nectar i believe and then i think (52:54 - 52:59)
you can buy slots for the to plant the (52:57 - 53:03)
yeah the little incubators yeah yeah yes (52:59 - 53:05)
i mean they're they're banking on per (53:03 - 53:07)
dot being their thing right like this is (53:05 - 53:10)
their money maker that's just theirs (53:07 - 53:13)
which i don't know (53:10 - 53:15)
yeah exactly (53:13 - 53:17)
exactly and a little burnt by a niantic (53:15 - 53:20)
at this point but yeah (53:17 - 53:20)
well (53:21 - 53:23)
um (53:22 - 53:25)
do you think that these changes are (53:23 - 53:29)
going to negatively impact pokemon go (53:25 - 53:31)
like if they don't have enough enough as (53:29 - 53:35)
many staff uh tied towards pokemon go (53:31 - 53:38)
i think that the the eight percent of (53:35 - 53:41)
staff probably were tied to the four in (53:38 - 53:44)
development projects that they had going (53:41 - 53:46)
or it could have been like folks that (53:44 - 53:48)
were a little bit more generalized that (53:46 - 53:51)
might not have been (53:48 - 53:53)
you know i think i think pokemon goes i (53:51 - 53:57)
don't think it's going anywhere no (53:53 - 53:57)
yeah (53:57 - 54:01)
but also like in most companies when (53:58 - 54:02)
they cut (54:01 - 54:03)
they cut from middle management they'll (54:02 - 54:06)
cut from hr resources (54:03 - 54:08)
they'll cut from (54:06 - 54:10)
quote unquote (54:08 - 54:11)
staff (54:10 - 54:13)
but they're not going to risk (54:11 - 54:14)
development of the one thing that makes (54:13 - 54:17)
them a billion dollars every year right (54:14 - 54:19)
so like they're going to cut (54:17 - 54:20)
extras for the projects that they didn't (54:19 - 54:22)
have and then they're going to redevote (54:20 - 54:23)
those people (54:22 - 54:26)
who is left to the ones that make money (54:23 - 54:27)
yeah and like maybe there was a team (54:26 - 54:29)
overseeing (54:27 - 54:31)
remote raids and a team that oversaw (54:29 - 54:33)
like this other thing and like they just (54:31 - 54:34)
were like these two teams are now one (54:33 - 54:35)
team (54:34 - 54:37)
and you fire the person that was (54:35 - 54:38)
interested they probably also got rid of (54:37 - 54:41)
the sales staff that went to other ips (54:38 - 54:42)
just like sell them on hey let's make a (54:41 - 54:46)
game those people are gone yeah (54:42 - 54:49)
so i don't think this (54:46 - 54:51)
bodes ill for pokemon go or anything (54:49 - 54:53)
like even if all of (54:51 - 54:55)
uh niantic's other (54:53 - 54:57)
things (54:55 - 54:59)
break down and fall to the wayside i (54:57 - 55:02)
think i think that tpci will keep (54:59 - 55:04)
pokemon go i'll keep it inflated yeah (55:02 - 55:05)
yeah (55:04 - 55:07)
i think also (55:05 - 55:11)
like we have to take (55:07 - 55:11)
we i have to take (55:11 - 55:15)
what businesses say and when they lay (55:13 - 55:17)
people off as a corporation (55:15 - 55:19)
with it's (55:17 - 55:21)
almost never a sign that they are in (55:19 - 55:23)
super trouble (55:21 - 55:25)
it is always a sign that they're not (55:23 - 55:26)
keeping their board happy and they're (55:25 - 55:28)
not making the profits that they want (55:26 - 55:30)
well but but also they're trying to stay (55:28 - 55:32)
out of trouble they're trying to stay (55:30 - 55:33)
out of trouble but (55:32 - 55:36)
but generally they're generally not (55:33 - 55:38)
in that much trouble when they do things (55:36 - 55:39)
like this (55:38 - 55:41)
it's not like (55:39 - 55:44)
we're scrambling to make money they make (55:41 - 55:46)
a lot of money they just really want to (55:44 - 55:47)
make (55:46 - 55:50)
more to keep people who invest in them (55:47 - 55:52)
to continue investing in them it's sort (55:50 - 55:54)
of the problem with the capitalist (55:52 - 55:57)
society is your business can be great (55:54 - 55:59)
but if you're answering to somebody else (55:57 - 56:00)
who could say hey (55:59 - 56:02)
i think i should be making more money (56:00 - 56:04)
off of the money i gave you (56:02 - 56:06)
and if you don't do that i'm going to (56:04 - 56:08)
take my money away they're going to be (56:06 - 56:11)
like okay these people are fired (56:08 - 56:14)
they're gone see ya bye bye we're going (56:11 - 56:16)
to counsel projects (56:14 - 56:18)
if we just we need to start the like i (56:16 - 56:21)
accuse capitalism podcast because right (56:18 - 56:24)
we live in a society where a company's (56:21 - 56:27)
performance is not even (56:24 - 56:30)
judged or evaluated based on how (56:27 - 56:32)
profitable it was in a particular (56:30 - 56:34)
quarter but actually on how well it (56:32 - 56:37)
projected it was going to do and if you (56:34 - 56:39)
project that you're not going to do well (56:37 - 56:41)
and then you do really well that's (56:39 - 56:44)
actually a bad thing (56:41 - 56:45)
and that's dumb (56:44 - 56:47)
oh yeah the the (56:45 - 56:50)
the way corporations work is the wildest (56:47 - 56:53)
most nightmarish system (56:50 - 56:54)
of (56:53 - 56:56)
projections like (56:54 - 56:59)
my company a giant (56:56 - 57:01)
behemoth of the company is supposed to (56:59 - 57:03)
be able to add (57:01 - 57:06)
the revenue of like (57:03 - 57:09)
a department store (57:06 - 57:11)
each year (57:09 - 57:14)
to be considered doing well (57:11 - 57:16)
like the amount of growth that people (57:14 - 57:18)
want basically out of (57:16 - 57:21)
investors wanting to make as much money (57:18 - 57:22)
as they can (57:21 - 57:24)
is obscene (57:22 - 57:25)
and so you get things like this and (57:24 - 57:27)
since a lot of people don't work heavily (57:25 - 57:29)
in corporations they'll look at things (57:27 - 57:31)
like niantic is laying people off (57:29 - 57:32)
diantic is doomed and i'm like nah (57:31 - 57:35)
niantic was just told by their board (57:32 - 57:37)
you're not making us enough money cut (57:35 - 57:39)
the flop oh yeah clearly not a sign that (57:37 - 57:40)
they're going out of business no they're (57:39 - 57:42)
not in trouble at all (57:40 - 57:44)
i do remember like when i worked so all (57:42 - 57:47)
through undergrad and other times in my (57:44 - 57:50)
life i worked a retail job and basically (57:47 - 57:52)
in like an electronics department (57:50 - 57:53)
um (57:52 - 57:56)
and i remember we were supposed to get (57:53 - 57:59)
over like five percent over the sales of (57:56 - 58:01)
the previous year (57:59 - 58:03)
for the whole week so (58:01 - 58:04)
which was really frustrating because if (58:03 - 58:07)
the previous week included a holiday or (58:04 - 58:09)
an event we were still supposed to get (58:07 - 58:11)
five percent over (58:09 - 58:13)
and (58:11 - 58:15)
like make it work somehow and then if we (58:13 - 58:18)
weren't doing well in sales we'd get (58:15 - 58:20)
less even though that had nothing to do (58:18 - 58:24)
with our effort level or anything (58:20 - 58:26)
we would get like either you know less (58:24 - 58:28)
less staff or (58:26 - 58:29)
um (58:28 - 58:31)
or like less resources and it was just (58:29 - 58:32)
like (58:31 - 58:34)
the reason we're doing poorly is because (58:32 - 58:37)
we eat more of those things (58:34 - 58:38)
so (58:37 - 58:40)
i do i do like no it's a little like (58:38 - 58:41)
especially from the ground like it can (58:40 - 58:43)
be really ridiculous sometimes when (58:41 - 58:44)
these (58:43 - 58:46)
upper level corporate is like oh just (58:44 - 58:48)
just do just work harder (58:46 - 58:52)
just just you know but sell that tv to (58:48 - 58:53)
someone and i'm like (58:52 - 58:56)
well it's also the weird thing of like (58:53 - 58:58)
how how department budgets work like you (58:56 - 59:01)
can't come in under budget (58:58 - 59:02)
because then they'll say well that's (59:01 - 59:05)
your new budget limit yep so you have to (59:02 - 59:07)
find ways of spending your projected (59:05 - 59:10)
budget yep so that you can keep the (59:07 - 59:12)
money and if you want to have any sort (59:10 - 59:15)
of leeway then at the end of the year (59:12 - 59:17)
you have to be like what do we need to (59:15 - 59:20)
buy like i have gotten so many office (59:17 - 59:22)
supplies in december because they're (59:20 - 59:24)
like do you need a new chair we have to (59:22 - 59:26)
spend thousands of dollars (59:24 - 59:29)
now before the year ends what can we get (59:26 - 59:31)
you (59:29 - 59:33)
it sounds lovely to me honestly i'd love (59:31 - 59:36)
just free free office supplies (59:33 - 59:38)
i mean it's always just like (59:36 - 59:41)
like we can't say we saved you money (59:38 - 59:43)
this year because (59:41 - 59:45)
you'll automatically cut our funding (59:43 - 59:47)
like we can't do the right thing it's (59:45 - 59:48)
just (59:47 - 59:51)
madness (59:48 - 59:51)
yep (59:54 - 59:57)
um (59:56 - 59:59)
yeah i mean (59:57 - 60:00)
this (59:59 - 60:04)
i don't know the articles it seems very (60:00 - 60:06)
very like (60:04 - 60:08)
you know big and explosive (60:06 - 60:10)
but it gets clicks right yeah it gets it (60:08 - 60:13)
clicks but then like click baity article (60:10 - 60:15)
having having i'm like yeah like that (60:13 - 60:18)
happens and especially after the last (60:15 - 60:20)
two years and (60:18 - 60:21)
and now (60:20 - 60:23)
like how the economy is actually going (60:21 - 60:25)
and stuff i'm like yeah this makes sense (60:23 - 60:27)
that they're doing this (60:25 - 60:29)
so (60:27 - 60:31)
will can't hear us currently (60:29 - 60:32)
yeah i know (60:31 - 60:34)
poor will all about will all right back (60:32 - 60:35)
to bees (60:34 - 60:37)
how can we (60:35 - 60:40)
cut budget from bees (60:37 - 60:40)
yeah (60:40 - 60:44)
how do we make how do we make more bees (60:42 - 60:46)
fish (60:44 - 60:49)
what's the profit margin on bees (60:46 - 60:51)
all right i guess the profit margin on (60:49 - 60:54)
bees is which fruit do you not want and (60:51 - 60:57)
where can we cut certain frames products (60:54 - 60:58)
we don't need almonds anymore i know (60:57 - 61:00)
that's what they're used for oh yeah (60:58 - 61:02)
there's a lot of honeybees that get (61:00 - 61:04)
shipped over to the almond harvest in (61:02 - 61:07)
california for sure so (61:04 - 61:09)
all right is there any other pokemon (61:07 - 61:11)

it's not appropriate (61:56 - 61:58)
um (61:57 - 61:59)
the last (61:58 - 62:01)
the last thing that i know we need to (61:59 - 62:04)
mention is something about yu-gi-oh (62:01 - 62:08)
no we're gonna have a yu-gi-oh free week (62:04 - 62:09)
okay (62:08 - 62:10)
redacted (62:09 - 62:13)
redacted (62:10 - 62:15)
oh boy so (62:13 - 62:18)
here is something (62:15 - 62:22)
interesting and i don't know like (62:18 - 62:23)
ben (62:22 - 62:27)
bandai namco and ilka merged (62:23 - 62:27)
um that's interesting (62:27 - 62:31)
so they've they've created a brand new (62:33 - 62:42)
studio called uh bandai namco aces (62:36 - 62:42)
so and ceo of ilka will take over (62:43 - 62:50)
partnership it's not a murderer (62:46 - 62:50)
yeah so they're creating a new (62:51 - 62:56)
something (62:53 - 62:56)
and who like because both mankind namco (62:56 - 63:03)
has made (63:00 - 63:03)
it says the aim is to deliver (63:07 - 63:10)
quote (63:09 - 63:13)
deep and lasting high quality content (63:10 - 63:16)
end quote (63:13 - 63:16)
what did they make um didn't they made (63:27 - 63:31)
they've made some (63:29 - 63:34)
farming games (63:31 - 63:34)
so bandai namco made the new pokemon (63:35 - 63:39)
staff right (63:37 - 63:42)
they made dorian story of seasons (63:39 - 63:45)
that's also not a pokemon title (63:42 - 63:49)
so bandai namco made pokken and the new (63:45 - 63:51)
pokemon snap ilka did the ill-fated (63:49 - 63:53)
brilliant diamond (63:51 - 63:55)
shining pearl remakes (63:53 - 63:57)
all right let me read an article since (63:55 - 63:59)
you brought this up here we go this is (63:57 - 64:01)
from (63:59 - 64:01)
nintendo soup.com i can't tell who the (64:01 - 64:06)
author is maybe his name is yo writer i (64:03 - 64:07)
can't tell (64:06 - 64:09)
bandai namco merges with pokemon (64:07 - 64:11)
brilliant diamond shining pearls ilka to (64:09 - 64:14)
form bandai namco aces bandai namco and (64:11 - 64:17)
ilka have announced that they will be (64:14 - 64:19)
merging to form a new studio named (64:17 - 64:21)
bandai namco aces i think that's about (64:19 - 64:23)
the right term but otherwise (64:21 - 64:25)
for those who may not be aware ilka was (64:23 - 64:28)
formerly a cg based video production (64:25 - 64:30)
company that went on to support (64:28 - 64:32)
development for many famous games such (64:30 - 64:34)
as near automata (64:32 - 64:36)
dragon quest (64:34 - 64:40)
11 or 9 i can't it's 11 and most (64:36 - 64:42)
recently pokemon brilliant diamond and (64:40 - 64:45)
shining pearl this new merger sees ilka (64:42 - 64:48)
owning 49 of the new studio while bandai (64:45 - 64:50)
namco owns the other 51 percent so it's (64:48 - 64:53)
not a merger it's a partnership okay ceo (64:50 - 64:56)
takuya iwasaki will be the new ceo and (64:53 - 64:58)
president of bandai namco aces with (64:56 - 65:00)
bandai namco's katsu (64:58 - 65:03)
toki kono director of ace combat will (65:00 - 65:05)
assume the role of vice president (65:03 - 65:08)
at the time of this writing it is not (65:05 - 65:10)
known what projects this new studio has (65:08 - 65:12)
planned although their new official (65:10 - 65:13)
website states that they will continue (65:12 - 65:15)
to deliver high quality content correct (65:13 - 65:18)
that is in quotes moving forward (65:15 - 65:22)
stay tuned for info as it comes what's (65:18 - 65:24)
weird is that (65:22 - 65:26)
ilka is going to be has the smaller (65:24 - 65:28)
percentage of ownership but they're (65:26 - 65:31)
going to be the leaders while bandai (65:28 - 65:32)
yeah (65:31 - 65:34)
i i mean (65:32 - 65:37)
i it's hard like it's definitely a (65:34 - 65:38)
partnership (65:37 - 65:41)
and it's definitely a brand new studio (65:38 - 65:41)
so (65:41 - 65:44)
i'm wondering if (65:41 - 65:47)
like ilka is saying we're gonna ship our (65:44 - 65:50)
game stuff off (65:47 - 65:52)
instead of having our own internal game (65:50 - 65:54)
department as part of the ilko umbrella (65:52 - 65:57)
corporation we're going to team up with (65:54 - 65:59)
bandai namco and bandai namco is going (65:57 - 66:03)
to send other things to this asus studio (65:59 - 66:06)
to work with ilka so they can focus on (66:03 - 66:08)
it's a lot of money shuffling but it's (66:06 - 66:11)
interesting that i feel like (66:08 - 66:14)
ilka is saying (66:11 - 66:16)
we have a lot of game contracts but we (66:14 - 66:17)
feel like we need to partner with people (66:16 - 66:19)
to (66:17 - 66:23)
to help fund that and to get (66:19 - 66:25)
stuff out the door and is it is a bit (66:23 - 66:28)
odd that (66:25 - 66:30)
the ceo of ilka who will lead it when (66:28 - 66:33)
they aren't the majority shareholder (66:30 - 66:37)
yeah that's that's odd but here let me (66:33 - 66:40)
give you the real news (66:37 - 66:42)
namco (66:40 - 66:45)
made katamari damasi yeah (66:42 - 66:49)
and ilka has pokemon home and billion (66:45 - 66:51)
diamonds shining pearl so they clearly (66:49 - 66:53)
have some pokemon contract (66:51 - 66:55)
are we getting (66:53 - 66:59)
a pokemon katamari damasi crossover is (66:55 - 67:01)
that what this is actually all about (66:59 - 67:04)
this is this is the game the world needs (67:01 - 67:06)
right now it certainly is it will bring (67:04 - 67:09)
world peace or a pokemon farming game a (67:06 - 67:12)
la dorimon no (67:09 - 67:13)
no (67:12 - 67:15)
no we are not supporting our members (67:13 - 67:17)
that's some other podcast that i don't (67:15 - 67:20)
listen to so no (67:17 - 67:20)
all right greg can we get the question (67:21 - 67:27)
of the week uh can we (67:23 - 67:27)
if i only could ask the question of the (67:29 - 67:36)
week and then we'll get our answers (67:32 - 67:40)
i reject no you cannot reject i don't (67:36 - 67:43)
accept these tick-tock children (67:40 - 67:46)
this is a song from my dad but you're (67:43 - 67:49)
buying in because that's how they they (67:46 - 67:50)
they put that as the sound on their (67:49 - 67:52)
ticket then everybody's like seymour (67:50 - 67:54)
that used this sound and it's like oh (67:52 - 67:56)
now here's all the shirtless dudes well (67:54 - 67:59)
i'm into that but (67:56 - 68:01)
just because an incredibly popular star (67:59 - 68:04)
became super popular again is not tick (68:01 - 68:07)
tock's fault besides we all know that (68:04 - 68:09)
july 8th tick tock is being banned so (68:07 - 68:12)
yeah right (68:09 - 68:14)
i'm here the fcc said all right (68:12 - 68:17)
our youtube question of the week (68:14 - 68:19)
although i really reject all of these (68:17 - 68:20)
questions of the week i really want (68:19 - 68:22)
folks to step up (68:20 - 68:24)
do better but (68:22 - 68:27)
here we go this is from cooksey (68:24 - 68:30)
i imagine in scarlet and violet we are (68:27 - 68:32)
going to see new forms of pokemon from (68:30 - 68:35)
previous generations (68:32 - 68:37)
which evolution line from a previous gen (68:35 - 68:40)
would you like to see get the obstagoon (68:37 - 68:43)
treatment where a two-stage evolution (68:40 - 68:45)
line gets a type change and a third (68:43 - 68:47)
stage (68:45 - 68:50)
also what types would your new forms be (68:47 - 68:52)
this is almost like a pokemon of the (68:50 - 68:54)
week question it has to be a two-stage (68:52 - 68:56)
pokemon (68:54 - 68:58)
that currently doesn't have another (68:56 - 69:01)
evolutionary line it's gonna get a new (68:58 - 69:06)
uh typing and a third evolution (69:01 - 69:09)
scarlet and violet the land of risotto (69:06 - 69:10)
i've got one (69:09 - 69:13)
go for it i go go go so i first started (69:10 - 69:15)
off googling (69:13 - 69:18)
animals in spain and one of the top (69:15 - 69:21)
animals in spain is the iberian ibex oh (69:18 - 69:24)
which is a type of goat (69:21 - 69:26)
and i immediately thought of skitto and (69:24 - 69:27)
go goat (69:26 - 69:30)
so which are grass type (69:27 - 69:31)
but (69:30 - 69:33)
because iberian ibex are one of those (69:31 - 69:38)
goats that like scales up a mountain (69:33 - 69:41)
it could be ground type (69:38 - 69:44)
and so that would be a region specific (69:41 - 69:45)
that (69:44 - 69:48)
fits in with i don't know what the third (69:45 - 69:50)
evolution's name would be (69:48 - 69:52)
um i iber goat i don't know i'm not (69:50 - 69:54)
entirely sure what they would want (69:52 - 69:56)
skidoo (69:54 - 69:57)
uh (69:56 - 70:01)
flybacks uh drybacks (69:57 - 70:03)
okay yeah yeah yeah so like something (70:01 - 70:05)
with ibex at the end of it yeah yeah (70:03 - 70:07)
yeah yeah yeah but it would be like (70:05 - 70:10)
ground or rock type or something all the (70:07 - 70:12)
transportation pokemon are coming back (70:10 - 70:15)
in the risotto region (70:12 - 70:17)

a male evolution (71:07 - 71:14)
that's an actual b and it'll be flying (71:09 - 71:16)
poison type it'll lose bug type (71:14 - 71:18)
that's called drone b (71:16 - 71:20)
i'm sure (71:18 - 71:23)
it's called drum b drone b (71:20 - 71:24)
b drone (71:23 - 71:27)
oh b drone so the problem with that is (71:24 - 71:29)
male bees cannot sting (71:27 - 71:32)
look does pokemon ever care about that (71:29 - 71:35)
wait how do male bees not sting (71:32 - 71:37)
they're the ones who are out there doing (71:35 - 71:41)
all the work no they're not no wait no (71:37 - 71:44)
no i thought there was only one lady bee (71:41 - 71:46)
in the whole hive and then everybody (71:44 - 71:49)
else was dudes opposite (71:46 - 71:49)
there's the queen there's all the (71:49 - 71:53)
workers and the foragers those are all (71:51 - 71:56)
female and then the drone is literally (71:53 - 71:57)
the only male (71:56 - 72:00)
the only thing he does is reproduce his (71:57 - 72:02)
literally his only purpose i have been (72:00 - 72:06)
lied to my entire life (72:02 - 72:09)
same for ants same for wasps they're all (72:06 - 72:11)
in the same order (72:09 - 72:12)
so yeah they (72:11 - 72:16)
they he couldn't he could not sting well (72:12 - 72:19)
okay now that attitude i'm sorry then (72:16 - 72:21)
maybe he's just but i don't want another (72:19 - 72:23)
bug flying (72:21 - 72:24)
yeah (72:23 - 72:26)
i'm sorry (72:24 - 72:28)
i did have an idea for another because i (72:26 - 72:32)
was in my quest for animals of of this (72:28 - 72:34)
this is the reason why there's no bee (72:32 - 72:35)
pokemon because yeah you suggest to be (72:34 - 72:38)
pokemon the entomologists come in and (72:35 - 72:40)
they're like well that actually doesn't (72:38 - 72:42)
work because there's actually only one (72:40 - 72:44)
male bee in the whole hive okay pokemon (72:42 - 72:47)
company find me on on twitter at cody (72:44 - 72:49)
mathis i will i will help you with we (72:47 - 72:51)
will figure out a good way to have a b (72:49 - 72:54)
pokemon i got you but (72:51 - 72:56)
um other things that could so like for (72:54 - 72:58)
example i looked up a b in spain would (72:56 - 72:59)
be uh (72:58 - 73:02)
a violet carpenter bee which is a black (72:59 - 73:05)
bee with purple wings and it has the (73:02 - 73:08)
word violet in its name too oh yeah (73:05 - 73:09)
and (73:08 - 73:11)
because i was thinking carpenter bees (73:09 - 73:13)
and it could be like just like woodrow (73:11 - 73:16)
or wood drone (73:13 - 73:17)
yeah (73:16 - 73:19)
you don't want the boy (73:17 - 73:21)
well actually so boy carpenter bees are (73:19 - 73:23)
really cute because they um if you've i (73:21 - 73:25)
don't know if you all have this in (73:23 - 73:27)
minnesota the carpenter bees that like (73:25 - 73:29)
get in your face i thought you were an (73:27 - 73:30)
expert (73:29 - 73:33)
i don't know where these bees are or not (73:30 - 73:35)
there's carpenter bee (73:33 - 73:37)
all over anyway if there's ever a (73:35 - 73:38)
carpenter bee like up in your face if he (73:37 - 73:41)
has a yellow face it's a boy and he (73:38 - 73:43)
cannot sting you so it's fine i am not (73:41 - 73:45)
pausing (73:43 - 73:47)
long enough (73:45 - 73:49)
to look at the color on there no no you (73:47 - 73:51)
know characters are screeching and (73:49 - 73:53)
running that is the only (73:51 - 73:54)
no no you know carpenter bees are the (73:53 - 73:56)
friendly ones because they're like 10 (73:54 - 73:59)
times the size of a normal bee they're (73:56 - 74:01)
big chunkers they are really so you know (73:59 - 74:03)
that they're like oh this is a friendly (74:01 - 74:05)
dude yeah there's no amount of insects (74:03 - 74:07)
yeah so they could have that much (74:05 - 74:09)
patience from me they could have they (74:07 - 74:11)
could introduce that um either as a (74:09 - 74:13)
third evolution or as its own thing and (74:11 - 74:16)
then introduce the european bee eater (74:13 - 74:18)
which is a bird (74:16 - 74:20)
that would eat that and then the other (74:18 - 74:22)
thing that is also in that area is the (74:20 - 74:25)
asian giant hornet (74:22 - 74:27)
of murder hornet fame well why are you (74:25 - 74:30)
proposing zombies when you've started (74:27 - 74:31)
out this whole program with complaints (74:30 - 74:33)
about insufficient bees (74:31 - 74:36)
because they it's it's a it's a cool of (74:33 - 74:37)
like (74:36 - 74:39)
interplay between these things so it's (74:37 - 74:41)
kind of like corsa (74:39 - 74:44)
having like like be like pokemon that (74:41 - 74:46)
have interactions together (74:44 - 74:48)
you know or pokemon have cool things (74:46 - 74:49)
just something like that one more (74:48 - 74:50)
question i didn't think that carpenter (74:49 - 74:52)
bees hived i thought they just kind of (74:50 - 74:54)
burrowed they do not so they are (74:52 - 74:56)
solitary um only nine percent of bee (74:54 - 74:59)
species are social and have a hive so (74:56 - 75:01)
they're solitary and all the knowledge (74:59 - 75:05)
we have given the kids this week man (75:01 - 75:07)
they said no it's so sorry all the bee (75:05 - 75:09)
knowledge we are giving them (75:07 - 75:12)
all the wrong knowledge we're giving (75:09 - 75:14)
up until this point in our lives is (75:12 - 75:18)
incorrect oh man this i want every kid (75:14 - 75:19)
out there listening to this program that (75:18 - 75:22)
has now decided that they are fascinated (75:19 - 75:26)
by bees get into it we need more bee (75:22 - 75:29)
scientists more wildfire biologists or (75:26 - 75:32)
whatever the heck hello 2075 did we make (75:29 - 75:34)
it (75:32 - 75:34)
are there bees did we make a change (75:35 - 75:40)
collective collective organisms are (75:37 - 75:42)
fascinating all right (75:40 - 75:44)
we have a question from slack as well (75:42 - 75:47)
now brandon did have a good question i (75:44 - 75:49)
will give you that (75:47 - 75:51)
but brandon seems to always have the (75:49 - 75:52)
good question and we always ask the (75:51 - 75:54)
brandon question so i was like not this (75:52 - 75:55)
week brandon (75:54 - 75:58)
so this week the question comes from (75:55 - 75:59)
kevin (75:58 - 76:01)
and the question is this is especially (75:59 - 76:03)
also for you dr mathis since you're (76:01 - 76:05)
based out of this great state of (76:03 - 76:08)
pennsylvania what's your favorite german (76:05 - 76:10)
food (76:08 - 76:13)
oh i'm on the spot now why why is that (76:10 - 76:15)
have to do with pennsylvania do you not (76:13 - 76:18)
realize the whole pennsylvania dutch are (76:15 - 76:21)
these big german community like the (76:18 - 76:24)
largest collective german community in i (76:21 - 76:25)
mean there's tons of germans in (76:24 - 76:27)
minnesota as well (76:25 - 76:30)
pennsylvania that's just the amish folks (76:27 - 76:32)
yep but they're from germany and they (76:30 - 76:34)
brought all their traditions and foods (76:32 - 76:35)
with them (76:34 - 76:37)
i really like their (76:35 - 76:41)
their does um their donuts they make (76:37 - 76:43)
there you go (76:41 - 76:47)
ich bin iberliner yes i am a doughnut i (76:43 - 76:48)
am a donut (76:47 - 76:50)
i really like their donuts though i was (76:48 - 76:52)
looking up uh german (76:50 - 76:55)
um desserts and i want to try the ice (76:52 - 76:57)
cream spaghetti (76:55 - 76:59)
what (76:57 - 77:01)
yeah it's a thing how do you spaghetti (76:59 - 77:02)
uh (77:01 - 77:04)
it's like it is spaghetti it's ice cream (77:02 - 77:06)
but it is it's called spaghetti ice (77:04 - 77:09)
cream and you press ice cream through a (77:06 - 77:11)
potato ricer and it gives you ice cream (77:09 - 77:13)
and then you put they put (77:11 - 77:14)
um (77:13 - 77:16)
strawberry sauce on it so this is (77:14 - 77:18)
another dimensions (77:16 - 77:22)
concept of cold stone just yeah (77:18 - 77:24)
all right here i'm gonna delicious i'm (77:22 - 77:27)
gonna go through a list of the top 10 (77:24 - 77:29)
german foods which i don't even (77:27 - 77:30)
recognize this website i've probably (77:29 - 77:34)
given myself a virus i am i am i am a (77:30 - 77:36)
bratwurst fan (77:34 - 77:38)
i love i love a good brat but i also (77:36 - 77:40)
like (77:38 - 77:43)
uh sauerbratten which is (77:40 - 77:45)
it's basically a giant (77:43 - 77:48)
pot roast but it's um (77:45 - 77:50)
i think the sauce is different it's more (77:48 - 77:52)
vinegary (77:50 - 77:55)
uh the german pot roast i i like that uh (77:52 - 77:59)
since i'm technically half german um (77:55 - 78:00)
i've had a few but not as much as (77:59 - 78:02)
swedish food mm-hmm (78:00 - 78:05)
all right so number one on the list was (78:02 - 78:06)
worst (78:05 - 78:08)
so that's just generally sausage yeah (78:06 - 78:11)
it's essentially horses uh of the worsts (78:08 - 78:13)
i like bratwurst (78:11 - 78:17)
ruladin i've never heard it before (78:13 - 78:17)
uh has a spot soul spa i think i've (78:17 - 78:22)
heard of that that's like dumplings i've (78:20 - 78:24)
had erladin (78:22 - 78:26)
i'm sure you've had ein top how are (78:24 - 78:27)
these the top ten and i've never even (78:26 - 78:29)
heard of these things that just looks (78:27 - 78:30)
like a bunch of vegetables in a coffee (78:29 - 78:32)
cup that's gross (78:30 - 78:34)
sauer broughton okay (78:32 - 78:36)
that's the one greg (78:34 - 78:39)
kartoffel (78:36 - 78:42)
uh that that just looks like fried (78:39 - 78:44)
fried pretzels (78:42 - 78:45)
good i'm glad steve could actually eat (78:44 - 78:47)
well germany (78:45 - 78:49)
they are uh that is specifically their (78:47 - 78:51)
version of potato pancakes (78:49 - 78:52)
schnitzel (78:51 - 78:55)
just fried (78:52 - 78:57)
uh here we go (78:55 - 79:02)
chavar svalder kirschtort (78:57 - 79:06)
oh kierstart is so delicious (79:02 - 79:06)
apples (79:06 - 79:08)
strudels are always yeah you know i'm a (79:09 - 79:13)
big strudel fan although i can't have (79:11 - 79:15)
apples anymore so (79:13 - 79:16)
man (79:15 - 79:18)
what would be my favorite german food (79:16 - 79:19)
i'd have to go with the (79:18 - 79:24)
with the sausages i'm a protein guy so (79:19 - 79:26)
so there's a very good german restaurant (79:24 - 79:29)
in uh minnesota that we can go there is (79:26 - 79:32)
a restaurant man i don't even know if it (79:29 - 79:34)
exists anymore i only ate there (79:32 - 79:37)
once in the 28 years or whatever that i (79:34 - 79:40)
lived in dc but i like my life rotated (79:37 - 79:42)
around this neighborhood where this (79:40 - 79:44)
restaurant is called old europe (79:42 - 79:46)
and it was a it was a german restaurant (79:44 - 79:48)
and they just like any of probably (79:46 - 79:50)
anything off this top 10 list you could (79:48 - 79:51)
get (79:50 - 79:53)
at that restaurant (79:51 - 79:54)
yeah (79:53 - 79:58)
black forest inn is is in minneapolis it (79:54 - 80:00)
is quite delicious wait what's the name (79:58 - 80:02)
of very german (80:00 - 80:04)
wait what's the name of it black forest (80:02 - 80:06)
it of course it's black forest right (80:04 - 80:08)
like that's the whole thing but (80:06 - 80:10)
i think like the couple of times i've (80:08 - 80:12)
gone to german restaurants i just get (80:10 - 80:14)
whatever has mashed potatoes and then (80:12 - 80:16)
it's some type of meat and that's (80:14 - 80:18)
yeah i mean that's a lot of children (80:16 - 80:20)
i know like but i would just be like (80:18 - 80:23)
let's try that and then it was (80:20 - 80:26)
obviously immemorable i don't know if (80:23 - 80:29)
there was a pokemon game (80:26 - 80:31)
let's not if there was when there will (80:29 - 80:34)
be because clearly in pokemon x and y (80:31 - 80:36)
those train tracks in that town were (80:34 - 80:39)
headed towards germany when there will (80:36 - 80:43)
be a germany based pokemon game (80:39 - 80:46)
what will be the food component (80:43 - 80:48)
of that game (80:46 - 80:48)
now (80:49 - 80:53)
i'm trying to think like you're you're (80:51 - 80:56)
saying like um like the potato mochi (80:53 - 80:58)
like that kind of thing well no like you (80:56 - 81:02)
had the the curry (80:58 - 81:06)
the curry combos then you had the um (81:02 - 81:09)
whatever the x and y the (81:06 - 81:11)
cookies (81:09 - 81:11)
so i think in germany you're going to (81:12 - 81:18)
grind up sausage yeah yeah (81:14 - 81:21)
it's all going to be about the first (81:18 - 81:21)
all right and i want i want so for the (81:23 - 81:27)
german (81:25 - 81:30)
one i want a vanilla like version that (81:27 - 81:31)
is (81:30 - 81:33)
spaghetti ice yeah (81:31 - 81:35)
oh there we go (81:33 - 81:37)
since it's already got three evolutions (81:35 - 81:40)
well it can all but it will be changed (81:37 - 81:42)
it'll have a it'll have a regional (81:40 - 81:43)
variant yeah (81:42 - 81:45)
all right pokemon of the week here we go (81:43 - 81:48)
it was very short last week so let me (81:45 - 81:49)
just go through it (81:48 - 81:52)
while growing berries and kalos it is (81:49 - 81:55)
possible for six pokemon to be found in (81:52 - 81:57)
your fully grown berry trees rustling (81:55 - 81:58)
the tree (81:57 - 82:02)
of these only one has a single evolution (81:58 - 82:05)
that is not influenced by or dependent (82:02 - 82:10)
upon the pokemon's gender (82:05 - 82:10)
it's (82:12 - 82:15)
magikarp (82:13 - 82:18)
because all bugs are fish now (82:15 - 82:21)
it's ladybug it's the diva how did you (82:18 - 82:24)
get it right wait what you actually how (82:21 - 82:26)
did i get it right (82:24 - 82:26)
i've been here (82:28 - 82:31)
clearly so complicated and difficult (82:29 - 82:35)
nobody could get it i'm repping insects (82:31 - 82:37)
here so i will say it could also have (82:35 - 82:39)
been uh vivian's middle evolution (82:37 - 82:41)
because it technically only has a single (82:39 - 82:44)
evolution past that point (82:41 - 82:44)
uh but i do you find that in the tree (82:44 - 82:50)
yeah (82:48 - 82:52)
the middle evolution yeah it was spuba (82:50 - 82:53)
yeah (82:52 - 82:55)
you get from the trees you get (82:53 - 82:56)
illuminized (82:55 - 82:58)
volbeat (82:56 - 83:00)
combi so combi and burme are the ones (82:58 - 83:01)
that are influenced by gender which is (83:00 - 83:04)
what you're doing (83:01 - 83:07)
by single evolution i meant it's not a (83:04 - 83:09)
three evolution pokemon stop being a (83:07 - 83:11)
rule shark (83:09 - 83:14)
i mean get get good with your uh word (83:11 - 83:17)
phrasing technically from spupa there is (83:14 - 83:20)
only a single evolution neck like after (83:17 - 83:22)
that and it is not influenced by gender (83:20 - 83:24)
but the correct answer is ladibo it is (83:22 - 83:25)
yes (83:24 - 83:29)
what is our ladybug (83:25 - 83:29)
uh (83:30 - 83:34)
other than the fact that i don't like it (83:32 - 83:36)
what you don't like ladiba i just don't (83:34 - 83:37)
like lydian (83:36 - 83:39)
i don't either yeah (83:37 - 83:41)
and i think this comes (83:39 - 83:43)
i think this comes from the fact that (83:41 - 83:45)
one of the only 100 pokemon that i have (83:43 - 83:47)
in pokemon go is a legend and it has no (83:45 - 83:51)
like like thanks niantic (83:47 - 83:51)
that has no (83:52 - 83:55)
it doesn't even have a shuffle icon (83:56 - 84:01)
that's how forgotten this is wait it has (83:58 - 84:03)
to have a shuffle icon not that i'm (84:01 - 84:04)
seeing yeah it does it does oh there it (84:03 - 84:06)
is there it is there it is there it is (84:04 - 84:08)
oh it's cute oh my god (84:06 - 84:10)
it is cute i can't skate (84:08 - 84:11)
shiny is pretty good let's see if (84:10 - 84:15)
there's any trivia there is um can be (84:11 - 84:18)
seen as a parallel to spinorax so since (84:15 - 84:21)
that they came from the same generation (84:18 - 84:24)
um despite its category its five spots (84:21 - 84:26)
are neither star-shaped nor are they (84:24 - 84:29)
arranged in a typical star pattern (84:26 - 84:31)
um it's shiny it's just kind of like a (84:29 - 84:35)
gold version of it um cannot learn (84:31 - 84:38)
good old gen 2. bug type or flying type (84:35 - 84:43)
moves until gen 3. good old gen 2. good (84:38 - 84:46)
job and it's tied with man psych as (84:43 - 84:48)
having the lowest base attack of all (84:46 - 84:51)
flying types so it's it's category is (84:48 - 84:53)
five-star pokemon (84:51 - 84:56)
interesting so (84:53 - 84:57)
i wonder why (84:56 - 84:59)
why (84:57 - 85:00)
why (84:59 - 85:01)
it's a ladybug (85:00 - 85:03)
well and it's funny because it seems to (85:01 - 85:06)
be based on the seven spotted ladybug so (85:03 - 85:08)
seven spots what is the other there's (85:06 - 85:10)
another name for ladybug because i've (85:08 - 85:12)
heard people call them that and they're (85:10 - 85:13)
looking like i was like no that's a (85:12 - 85:15)
ladybug what are you talking about (85:13 - 85:16)
there's (85:15 - 85:18)
not a ladybird beetle which is i know (85:16 - 85:20)
it's close enough to ladybug but there (85:18 - 85:22)
was some other names that somebody (85:20 - 85:24)
called it i mean the only thing i call (85:22 - 85:26)
it the other thing i would call it as a (85:24 - 85:27)
coccinellin (85:26 - 85:29)
but that's well that's you that's (85:27 - 85:32)
because you don't understand that fish (85:29 - 85:36)
aren't bugs you're a science nerd (85:32 - 85:38)
ladybird beetles or lady beetles is the (85:36 - 85:41)
only other things i've heard them (85:38 - 85:41)
all right (85:41 - 85:43)
here we go this week this could be (85:41 - 85:45)
another i'm sorry sorry this could be (85:43 - 85:46)
another pokemon because (85:45 - 85:49)
um the family (85:46 - 85:51)
which is coxonellity uh (85:49 - 85:54)
is derived from the latin word coccineus (85:51 - 85:57)
meaning scarlet (85:54 - 85:57)
this could be another thing (85:57 - 86:01)
regional ladybug coming scarlet violet (85:59 - 86:04)

united states of america we visit unova (86:20 - 86:25)
and galler for our pokemon of the week (86:23 - 86:28)
this pokemon who could originally only (86:25 - 86:31)
be found in the wild with its hidden (86:28 - 86:32)
ability (86:31 - 86:34)
had to be given a piece of candy to (86:32 - 86:35)
become (86:34 - 86:38)
catchable one character (86:35 - 86:41)
one characteristic it shares across (86:38 - 86:43)
regional forms is the potential to be (86:41 - 86:45)
fire type (86:43 - 86:47)
