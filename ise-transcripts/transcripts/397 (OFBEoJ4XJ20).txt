episode title that there's an interview (1:10 - 1:15)
this episode with dr. lava they are the (1:12 - 1:19)
twitter / youtuber that posts old (1:15 - 1:22)
pokemon history and we talked a little (1:19 - 1:24)
bit about that stuff with like Goro Chu (1:22 - 1:25)
which was supposed to be the evolution (1:24 - 1:30)
ride shoe and the Gen 4 sprite female (1:25 - 1:33)

across this information what he actually (1:34 - 1:39)
does with the information you know going (1:37 - 1:42)
forward so that'll be in the middle of (1:39 - 1:44)
the episode and it was it was a great (1:42 - 1:46)
interview okay we got a jam-packed show (1:44 - 1:48)
for you guys so we're gonna go through (1:46 - 1:51)
the stuff there's certain news articles (1:48 - 1:58)
I didn't pull I'm sure you I saw it by (1:51 - 2:01)
at the start well well let's just jump (1:58 - 2:05)
right in the news there there's a new (2:01 - 2:08)
episode of Twilight wings that podcast (2:05 - 2:10)
oh good well listen to that in the (2:08 - 2:14)
patreon feed I will save my opinions for (2:10 - 2:18)
it speaking of controversy that's good (2:14 - 2:19)
let's talk about a different controversy (2:18 - 2:21)
for it let's talk about a different (2:19 - 2:26)
controversy this is egg events that have (2:21 - 2:28)
made up the last couple things in (2:26 - 2:31)
Pokemon go the egg-cellent egg events (2:28 - 2:34)
yes think the sulfur road did some (2:31 - 2:37)
research and what how did they how did (2:34 - 2:39)
they frame this we're not gonna do it (2:37 - 2:39)
anymore (2:39 - 2:42)
well no no not that they like calculated (2:39 - 2:45)
the amount of days it's like January (2:42 - 2:47)
well since the start of the year and how (2:45 - 2:51)
many of those days had events and out of (2:47 - 2:53)
those days that had event since the year (2:51 - 2:55)
started like 77% of them involved egg (2:53 - 2:59)
events I think it was 48 out of 62 days (2:55 - 3:02)
had egg events yes yes there you go so (2:59 - 3:04)
that's a lot of egg events and we've (3:02 - 3:08)
complained on the show about how the egg (3:04 - 3:14)
events seemed awful and and other people (3:08 - 3:16)
have also complained and then we decided (3:14 - 3:19)
to start a petition hashtag bring back (3:16 - 3:21)
no egg events know that I'm just kidding (3:19 - 3:23)
that didn't happen that I did so the (3:21 - 3:25)
controversy that they changed it (3:23 - 3:27)
apparently this is this is the (3:25 - 3:29)
controversy I guess this is the issue is (3:27 - 3:34)
the antek came out and told third party (3:29 - 3:36)
sources that they've changed it and they (3:34 - 3:39)
said to these third party sources such (3:36 - 3:42)
as like trainer tips or some other (3:39 - 3:46)
youtubers or some other sources of media (3:42 - 3:51)
that the the starters the clone starters (3:46 - 3:53)
that are we're going to be available in (3:51 - 3:56)
7k eggs will now also be available in (3:53 - 3:59)
one-star raids a great start they have (3:56 - 4:03)
also said they plan on redoing events in (3:59 - 4:05)
the future based off what they've heard (4:03 - 4:07)
about the complaints for all these egg (4:05 - 4:10)
events which is that's all good that's (4:07 - 4:12)
all great my problem is you can't (4:10 - 4:15)
actually find the antics saying this you (4:12 - 4:18)
can only find like youtubers repeating (4:15 - 4:20)
that like we've talked to Manta can they (4:18 - 4:23)
said oh and we saw this before with (4:20 - 4:26)
Darumaka where they said we're knee (4:23 - 4:29)
antic said don't worry after Darmok is (4:26 - 4:30)
out of 7k eggs it will appear in the (4:29 - 4:33)
wild but they never posted an official (4:30 - 4:35)
statement about that they told I think (4:33 - 4:38)
like an Instagram person and then the (4:35 - 4:41)
Instagram person told us and then back a (4:38 - 4:45)
couple months ago suddenly gibble shiny (4:41 - 4:47)
gibble was available but again they (4:45 - 4:49)
didn't tell anyone except they told an (4:47 - 4:51)
instagramer and the Instagram person (4:49 - 4:53)
told us (4:51 - 4:56)
I get that knee antic is working with (4:53 - 4:59)
youtubers and influencers not us because (4:56 - 5:02)
I think we're too negative we don't (4:59 - 5:05)
influence we could be come on I mean we (5:02 - 5:09)
can change with make an offer there's (5:05 - 5:12)
there's a couple things one is like why (5:09 - 5:14)
are they not just they they have they (5:12 - 5:16)
can push us news in the app they have a (5:14 - 5:18)
website that we go to and report on they (5:16 - 5:20)
have their own Twitter account which (5:18 - 5:22)
we've gotten news from before when they (5:20 - 5:25)
reply to people but they seem to rely on (5:22 - 5:28)
aaniin influencers that one not everyone (5:25 - 5:30)
follows and if you're going to tell like (5:28 - 5:33)
the gibble and the the gibble is a good (5:30 - 5:35)
example they only told one influencer (5:33 - 5:38)
and it wasn't until very much later on (5:35 - 5:40)
the other influencers just piggybacked (5:38 - 5:42)
off that initial influencer but we don't (5:40 - 5:46)
even know what influencers they work (5:42 - 5:48)
with and i feel like that should be (5:46 - 5:50)
disclosed like i work like if nintendo (5:48 - 5:53)
sends me a free game not only do i have (5:50 - 5:55)
to include hashtag free game in my tweet (5:53 - 5:58)
and i have to include hashtag free game (5:55 - 6:01)
if i'm streaming it on twitch but there (5:58 - 6:03)
was like one time i forgot about it and (6:01 - 6:05)
nintendo like messaged me and they were (6:03 - 6:07)
like you're that we were like they were (6:05 - 6:08)
like hey just a heads up out of your (6:07 - 6:10)
four videos this one doesn't have the (6:08 - 6:12)
hashtag in it can you update that video (6:10 - 6:14)
and I was like oh yeah I'm super sorry (6:12 - 6:16)
like that was an accident because (6:14 - 6:17)
sometimes I changed my when I'm (6:16 - 6:18)
streaming on Twitch sometimes I'm (6:17 - 6:21)
changing games and then I'm changing the (6:18 - 6:23)
type the title and then twitch only (6:21 - 6:24)
remembers one of your multiple titles (6:23 - 6:26)
that you have and then when D it with (6:24 - 6:28)
DNA you know any time we bring up (6:26 - 6:30)
Pokemon master news it's just very easy (6:28 - 6:32)
to say like hey I specifically work with (6:30 - 6:36)
DNA but I've I have like no clue which (6:32 - 6:38)
influencers are working with me antic I (6:36 - 6:40)
don't know where to find that (6:38 - 6:43)
information who I don't get why any anti (6:40 - 6:46)
geared is are they like doing it so they (6:43 - 6:47)
don't have like any responsibilities of (6:46 - 6:50)
like if the SHINee gable broke they (6:47 - 6:52)
could be like well you know we never (6:50 - 6:55)
officially said it gives some plausible (6:52 - 6:59)
deniability I guess but in kind of a (6:55 - 7:00)
terrible way (6:59 - 7:03)
that's the whole universe of possible (7:00 - 7:06)
can I have anything is a terrible way (7:03 - 7:08)
yes you don't use plausible deniability (7:06 - 7:12)
for good things well the good news out (7:08 - 7:14)
of all of this is if you don't want to (7:12 - 7:18)
buy incubators and you want to get these (7:14 - 7:21)
starters those Lonestar the clone (7:18 - 7:22)
starters they will also be available in (7:21 - 7:26)
raids which I said this before I would (7:22 - 7:28)
rather spend a dollar ensuring I'm (7:26 - 7:31)
getting a Pokemon that I'm writing said (7:28 - 7:34)
dollar for and some spending how much is (7:31 - 7:35)
an incubator either a dollar fifty or (7:34 - 7:39)
two dollars for three random chances of (7:35 - 7:40)
who knows what (7:39 - 7:42)
probably leftover Luvdisc from the (7:40 - 7:45)
Valentine's Day event for the amount of (7:42 - 7:47)
money that the three of us have (7:45 - 7:50)
cumulatively put into Pokemon go I (7:47 - 7:52)
honestly think that we should be the (7:50 - 7:56)
influencers yeah and then we'll stop (7:52 - 7:57)
complaining about them using other (7:56 - 8:00)
influencers yeah I mean oh I know well (7:57 - 8:03)
just stop complaining if you give me (8:00 - 8:06)
free stuff well the ante has paid for us (8:03 - 8:11)
to go to go fest before when not not not (8:06 - 8:18)
all of us so not all of us I see where I (8:11 - 8:22)
am pecking order a bunch of crap I'm not (8:18 - 8:24)
saying I don't like the people some of (8:22 - 8:29)
the people who are on the show but - (8:24 - 8:32)
before that Pokemon good news I'm just (8:29 - 8:35)
saying that I feel like there probably (8:32 - 8:38)
is some legal gray area that knee antic (8:35 - 8:39)
is avoiding with a lot of stuff right (8:38 - 8:42)
now true and if the people from play (8:39 - 8:44)
Rick's would like me to say positive (8:42 - 8:45)
things about garden scapes (8:44 - 8:47)
I did start putting money into your game (8:45 - 8:52)
so my ears are up in friends why are you (8:47 - 8:58)
playing that game I love it it's sick I (8:52 - 9:04)
mean it's sick speaking of sick yes (8:58 - 9:04)
Funko pops are the greatest thing ever (9:06 - 9:11)
I'm so happy that everybody out there (9:09 - 9:13)
has the opportunity (9:11 - 9:15)
get them can we just become a Funko (9:13 - 9:18)
podcast because week it look that cubone (9:15 - 9:23)
has turned me Funko positive I hate that (9:18 - 9:28)
word a lot oh the one facto positive (9:23 - 9:31)
yeah I think the Pikachu is cuter a (9:28 - 9:34)
peach is very cute but Atta was real (9:31 - 9:36)
cute too I don't know the huge frittata (9:34 - 9:40)
or pea Japan but that Cuban though yeah (9:36 - 9:44)
that is all of it so I'm sold on Franken (9:40 - 9:47)
berry Morton Salt girl and cubone like (9:44 - 9:50)
you're winning me over so this was this (9:47 - 9:53)
came out of the New York Toy Fair how (9:50 - 9:54)
which I feel like didn't get that much (9:53 - 9:57)
coverage the last year or also last year (9:54 - 10:00)
but maybe I'm just maybe that's on me (9:57 - 10:04)
the I think that's on you okay (10:00 - 10:08)
but the Toy Fair was held February 22nd (10:04 - 10:10)
to the 25th it's actually still going on (10:08 - 10:14)
as of this recording but they showed off (10:10 - 10:17)
another four new Funko pops which is (10:14 - 10:18)
another Pikachu so I think they're up to (10:17 - 10:21)
three or four Funko Pikachu's at this (10:18 - 10:24)
point growlithe icky bone and a Rattata (10:21 - 10:27)
they will also be doing a 10-inch (10:24 - 10:29)
version of Mewtwo which will be (10:27 - 10:33)
exclusive to target for $29.99 and this (10:29 - 10:36)
is to follow the but they have done (10:33 - 10:38)
Bulbasaur Charmander squirtle they did (10:36 - 10:38)
Eevee (10:38 - 10:40)
and then earlier this month they (10:38 - 10:42)
announced me to mr. mime Vulpix and (10:40 - 10:46)
Pichu and out of I didn't recognize I (10:42 - 10:48)
didn't realize this but still kind of (10:46 - 10:50)
arrow pointed this out the only Jen to (10:48 - 10:51)
Pokemon out of this was Pichu otherwise (10:50 - 10:53)
everything so far has been genuine I (10:51 - 10:56)
mean that's no surprise I mean hello (10:53 - 11:01)
relay Gnaeus yeah we sure do I mean this (10:56 - 11:03)
eight they're gonna go the Pokemon go (11:01 - 11:05)
route and sudden the people I'd be like (11:03 - 11:08)
I mean when's Gen 5 coming like they're (11:05 - 11:10)
still in Gen 1 they're gonna milk this (11:08 - 11:13)
till 2050 is there I mean I'm trying to (11:10 - 11:15)
think of like a series that has like a (11:13 - 11:17)
lot of characters and they actually did (11:15 - 11:19)
every character I think Harry Potter had (11:17 - 11:24)
a lot of fun goes the Golden Girls (11:19 - 11:24)
Hillary yeah my favorite Hillary Hillary (11:25 - 11:34)
I really loved Bianca Samantha and (11:30 - 11:36)
Joanne (11:34 - 11:37)
those are my yeah or favorite or the (11:36 - 11:41)
best i I don't know that (11:37 - 11:42)
they've done every character of one (11:41 - 11:44)
series like I think they've done the (11:42 - 11:48)
main characters of one series but I (11:44 - 11:49)
don't think there's like a Moaning (11:48 - 11:56)
Myrtle Funko oh I know they did they did (11:49 - 11:59)
the like what's his name Dean the like (11:56 - 12:01)
Harry Potter is only black Moaning (11:59 - 12:05)
Myrtle Harry Potter's one black friend (12:01 - 12:08)
yeah they do that we're gonna avoid what (12:05 - 12:10)
controversy and walk is the others what (12:08 - 12:17)
I'm hearing right now list of Harry (12:10 - 12:17)
Potter (12:17 - 12:23)
Funko Wow they literally have on the (12:17 - 12:25)
Funko or I guess it's off the Funko site (12:23 - 12:28)
a Harry Potter shop that is only Harry (12:25 - 12:31)
Potter holy cow there's a lot of Harry (12:28 - 12:34)
Potter Funko's there's oh there's a (12:31 - 12:37)
chess set that's (12:34 - 12:37)
that's not fun no but there's a Viktor (12:37 - 12:45)
Krum Yule Ball Funko what oh there is (12:41 - 12:48)
it's really bad there's a Cho Chang (12:45 - 12:51)
there's a there's multiple uh Harry (12:48 - 12:53)
Potter's of course multiple run of cars (12:51 - 12:56)
there's a Malfoy with a whip spider I (12:53 - 12:59)
don't know what that means (12:56 - 12:59)
Quidditch Draco Malfoy from Hot Topic (13:02 - 13:07)
only there's the you could just get a (13:05 - 13:10)
basket liske as a Harry Potter figure (13:07 - 13:13)
sure you got mad guy Budhia (13:10 - 13:15)
I remember let me just say they've done (13:13 - 13:16)
almost every important character in (13:15 - 13:19)
Harry Potter looking at this list so (13:16 - 13:20)
that's what I'm worried about Pokemon (13:19 - 13:24)
because if if if Game Freak has enough (13:20 - 13:27)
audacity to put both qwilfish and Murr (13:24 - 13:29)
actus into sword and shield then I would (13:27 - 13:32)
imagine that Funko has enough audacity (13:29 - 13:36)
to make a bar budge figure look if Funko (13:32 - 13:38)
doesn't make it dunce if they don't make (13:36 - 13:39)
it done sports they better quit now (13:38 - 13:43)
frauds like Mammon floor now long wine (13:39 - 13:46)
I'm you can get it from me for my 100th (13:43 - 13:48)
birthday there's a lot of Harry Potter (13:46 - 13:51)
Funko's I am still scrolling on this (13:48 - 13:53)
page I found are you on cardboard (13:51 - 14:02)
connection calm I am hotter shop calm I (13:53 - 14:06)
am only at Dolores Umbridge number 39 (14:02 - 14:09)
there's two hagwons oh one what is (14:06 - 14:11)
flocked and one is unlocked (14:09 - 14:15)
I see there's a hermit (14:11 - 14:17)
I could never say her name her moaning (14:15 - 14:20)
or my any or my my Annie there's one of (14:17 - 14:22)
her as a cat (14:20 - 14:25)
yeah that's an important plot point the (14:22 - 14:28)
Polyjuice potion went wrong right in in (14:25 - 14:31)
three years this podcast is us going to (14:28 - 14:33)
be it's just us talking about which (14:31 - 14:36)
which Pokemon Funko's were missing and (14:33 - 14:38)
they're only gonna be up to like Gen 2 (14:36 - 14:41)
and it's gonna be like glow-in-the-dark (14:38 - 14:45)

I bet alright (14:56 - 15:00)
yes I have not been to Canada don't say (14:58 - 15:04)
I didn't say it you you didn't have to I (15:00 - 15:07)
could hear the typing sword and shield (15:04 - 15:10)
TCG set just came out if you're thinking (15:07 - 15:11)
about getting into the Pokemon Trading (15:10 - 15:13)
Card Game (15:11 - 15:15)
both will and I will advise you not to (15:13 - 15:18)
but if you decide that you hate money (15:15 - 15:21)
the sword shield just came out or (15:18 - 15:23)
anything is anything good ah there's a (15:21 - 15:27)
Cramer it but is it good ah it was good (15:23 - 15:29)
until this past weekend now it's not (15:27 - 15:29)
good anymore (15:29 - 15:32)
this weekend they released some promos (15:29 - 15:36)
oh the Oceania championships in (15:32 - 15:37)
Australia happened (15:36 - 15:40)
oh and nobody played Cara Maria no the (15:37 - 15:43)
people who did play Kramer aunt lost (15:40 - 15:43)
Kramer aunt has a four three colorless (15:44 - 15:50)
energy can do 160 damage to any Pokemon (15:47 - 15:53)
on the bench or not which is very good (15:50 - 15:55)
people run to den agx (15:53 - 15:57)
but they never use it to attack they (15:55 - 16:00)
just run D it did n AG X for the ability (15:57 - 16:06)
and so did n AG X has ironically 160 HP (16:00 - 16:10)
and if you knock it out it gives you two (16:06 - 16:13)
prizes so what what the thought process (16:10 - 16:16)
was is I will put one creme around in my (16:13 - 16:19)
deck and when I only need to knock out (16:16 - 16:20)
one more GX (16:19 - 16:22)
come on and or take two prizes I will (16:20 - 16:24)
drop the creamer and move the energy (16:22 - 16:27)
snipe the dedenne win the game that (16:24 - 16:32)
didn't happen no that didn't have if you (16:27 - 16:35)
only have one of a card in your deck is (16:32 - 16:37)
you will never see it Pokemon TCG is (16:35 - 16:39)
still just shuffle everything until I (16:37 - 16:40)
get what I want right I mean that's how (16:39 - 16:43)
you play the game shuffle shuffle (16:40 - 16:45)

like six month roadmap and they said (20:08 - 20:13)
that this this month would include news (20:11 - 20:15)
stories this month would include news (20:13 - 20:19)
stories etc etc and they've really stuck (20:15 - 20:20)
to that to a tee I don't think they were (20:19 - 20:22)
late on anything they originally (20:20 - 20:24)

it she was with Sylvia as of this (21:23 - 21:27)
podcast we can reveal that it is Sylvia (21:25 - 21:33)
I predicted it right yeah so her sake (21:27 - 21:34)
Paris thought of Sylvia and I'm pretty (21:33 - 21:34)
sure (21:34 - 21:39)
besides Mina and grand bull this is the (21:34 - 21:41)
second fairy sinker they're adding to (21:39 - 21:44)
the game alright second bit of news here (21:41 - 21:46)
is that there is an update to the app (21:44 - 21:49)
and they've changed some things in the (21:46 - 21:53)
update sync Paris can now be used sync (21:49 - 21:54)
Paris can now use a new feature known as (21:53 - 21:56)
lucky skills sync pairs level caps have (21:54 - 21:59)
been adjusted the amount of XP acquired (21:56 - 22:02)
in some areas have been increased area (21:59 - 22:04)
detailed view can now be seen in all (22:02 - 22:06)
areas that contain battles sync pairs (22:04 - 22:08)
that appear and their types and (22:06 - 22:10)
weaknesses can now be viewed an area (22:08 - 22:13)
detail they fix the bug we're in a rare (22:10 - 22:18)
occasion specific circumstance um of the (22:13 - 22:21)
AI and they have done some minor bug (22:18 - 22:24)
fixes and improvements so update your (22:21 - 22:27)
app there is a whole thing about what I (22:24 - 22:29)
just mentioned they changed some of the (22:27 - 22:32)
level cap levels for specific six pairs (22:29 - 22:33)
we don't know we don't need to go (22:32 - 22:34)
through the whole list it's pretty long (22:33 - 22:36)
but they've changed it so it's ideally (22:34 - 22:38)
easier to level up your current (22:36 - 22:41)
characters the big news here is if you (22:38 - 22:43)
missed it maybe you just got into (22:41 - 22:45)
Pokemon masters the mu-2 and Giovanni (22:43 - 22:47)
are coming back well thank goodness (22:45 - 22:50)
because I miss fat to coincide with the (22:47 - 22:52)
new changes with the changes new (22:50 - 22:55)
exchange options will be available and (22:52 - 22:57)
it looks like the item exchange period (22:55 - 23:00)
will begin on March 5th and Giovanni (22:57 - 23:01)
will run (23:00 - 23:05)
from March 5th to March 15th I don't (23:01 - 23:07)
know why you guys didn't tell me that (23:05 - 23:10)
the team break from Pokemon masters is (23:07 - 23:15)
basically Pokemon dual players who got (23:10 - 23:18)
mad cuz their game got canceled so (23:15 - 23:21)
they're invading another game with their (23:18 - 23:24)
masks is is that what they look like in (23:21 - 23:27)
duel I don't remember I mean kind of (23:24 - 23:30)
feel everybody had to wear a mask so (23:27 - 23:33)
team break has like a cool animation (23:30 - 23:34)
though when you battle them how like the (23:33 - 23:37)
their masks slash the be like kind of (23:34 - 23:39)
zooms into the screen yeah how do I (23:37 - 23:41)
haven't really had one team break battle (23:39 - 23:43)
and I didn't notice that it was on the (23:41 - 23:46)
beach I was trying to find a I also just (23:43 - 23:49)
like the concept of they have all the (23:46 - 23:51)
character models in the game and like (23:49 - 23:53)
they just put up masks on them to (23:51 - 23:56)
represent that their team break it's (23:53 - 23:59)
like really kind of dumb but also like I (23:56 - 24:02)
love it so much because it's like much (23:59 - 24:05)
better than this is like older Pokemon (24:02 - 24:07)
games where they would just be like oh (24:05 - 24:10)
I'm part of Team Rocket and they'll like (24:07 - 24:12)
spin around and then they just turned (24:10 - 24:14)
they're like little sprite just turns (24:12 - 24:17)
into a Team Rocket grunt I just think (24:14 - 24:20)
this is like way more funny of just it's (24:17 - 24:22)
an ace trainer boy but let's just put (24:20 - 24:24)
the mask on them or like the hiker with (24:22 - 24:26)
the team break mask is really funny to (24:24 - 24:27)
me (24:26 - 24:31)
spoilers haven't gotten that far today (24:27 - 24:34)
every model has a team break mask I'm (24:31 - 24:37)
pretty sure Greg did you poles Stephen (24:34 - 24:40)
nope so like I don't want to waste all (24:37 - 24:43)
of my gems on trying to get Stephen (24:40 - 24:48)
stone when there are for sure at least (24:43 - 24:50)
three new one coming I think isn't (24:48 - 24:55)
because they've rashon supermodel Alisa (24:50 - 24:57)
Valerie and her sylveon and we know red (24:55 - 25:00)
is in there I don't know if it's in this (24:57 - 25:02)
one but we've seen him yeah that was (25:00 - 25:04)
kind of like the weird thing so I think (25:02 - 25:07)
that that was on the Japanese Twitter so (25:04 - 25:09)
we can talk about Lisa (25:07 - 25:11)
Eliza ally ally I think she I'm almost (25:09 - 25:14)
positive when you grill you pull her she (25:11 - 25:15)
says I'm Ally (25:14 - 25:18)
I think so because like the American one (25:15 - 25:20)
says Cygnus utilize and Rotom are (25:18 - 25:26)
joining the fray and the Japanese one (25:20 - 25:31)
says it's Valerie and Sylvia okay (25:26 - 25:32)
joining the fray yeah (25:31 - 25:34)
so the Rotom one is really weird I just (25:32 - 25:35)
want to talk about this real quick (25:34 - 25:36)
because I really like Eliza and that's (25:35 - 25:39)
my favorite sync pair is that Zeb (25:36 - 25:42)
Stryker in Eliza so like seeing Eliza (25:39 - 25:45)
get a another Pokemon is really cool and (25:42 - 25:48)
I know some people were like oh oh can (25:45 - 25:50)
you are kind of weird but not really (25:48 - 25:53)
because like Oakes gern the reason oak (25:50 - 25:58)
gives red and blue and I guess chase and (25:53 - 26:03)
trace the Pokedex is because he wants to (25:58 - 26:05)
document all the Pokemon but he can't do (26:03 - 26:07)
it yourself and his main goal was to (26:05 - 26:10)
like he like II know I'm pretty I made (26:07 - 26:11)
me a member I yes correct me like he (26:10 - 26:14)
knows MU exists but he's never been able (26:11 - 26:18)
to document it so it when you get this (26:14 - 26:22)
is weird you learn why professor oak has (26:18 - 26:27)
mu by going through his sync story okay (26:22 - 26:31)
I have enough so it's it's very strange (26:27 - 26:33)
because you're introduced to this pair (26:31 - 26:36)
and you're introduced to Professor Oak (26:33 - 26:38)
who's like I want to join your team and (26:36 - 26:40)
this is my partner and then you do a (26:38 - 26:42)
sync story and it's got a completely (26:40 - 26:44)
different partner and at the end of it (26:42 - 26:46)
is like I wanna join your tea even like (26:44 - 26:49)
we've already covered this okay I know (26:46 - 26:53)
you're old but come on oh we've talked (26:49 - 26:55)
about like why doesn't mean I have (26:53 - 26:58)
grandpa land not Rabanne B but I guess (26:55 - 27:02)
you could get a sig signature Cygnus (26:58 - 27:06)
suit but ELISA or Liza doesn't ever hit (27:02 - 27:10)
rook Tom ever I get that her dress looks (27:06 - 27:12)
like Rotom which is really cool that's (27:10 - 27:14)
just really good and she's like she have (27:12 - 27:17)
a wait does she never have not in any of (27:14 - 27:20)
the game so yeah so in in black and (27:17 - 27:22)
white she has a Moga Emolga (27:20 - 27:27)
substrate which i always hate when they (27:22 - 27:29)
give (27:27 - 27:32)
trainers / gym leaders the same Pokemon (27:29 - 27:35)
a mogul bowgasm Tyga's of shreeka the (27:32 - 27:39)
the or maybe in Gen 2 with Morty (27:35 - 27:41)
you know the gen where they introduced (27:39 - 27:43)
new ghost Pokemon like mr. Rivas (27:41 - 27:46)
they gave Marty hunter Hunter hunter (27:43 - 27:49)
gang guy so in black and white - she has (27:46 - 27:52)
Emolga flappy and then zip Strika (27:49 - 27:54)
so perfect they got rid of animo we gave (27:52 - 27:57)
her a flappy and then in challenge mode (27:54 - 27:59)
so if you do the harder black and white (27:57 - 28:03)
- they gave her Emolga flappy Joel tick (27:59 - 28:05)
and zip Strika (28:03 - 28:09)
and then in the world tournament (28:05 - 28:13)
she has zip Strika Ampharos Galvin (28:09 - 28:17)
Chawla Emolga Electress and stunfisk and (28:13 - 28:20)
it's possible that you can match her up (28:17 - 28:24)
and she adds on a luxray and drops the (28:20 - 28:25)
Galvin Sheila (28:24 - 28:29)
so no in in no sense that she ever have (28:25 - 28:33)
a Rotom and I'm not like it's fine like (28:29 - 28:36)
she's an electric gym leader and wrote (28:33 - 28:38)
like it's just you would think that (28:36 - 28:39)
Emolga (28:38 - 28:44)
would come before Rotom as like she (28:39 - 28:47)
always has the Emolga with her as well (28:44 - 28:50)
as somebody more special I don't know of (28:47 - 28:53)
another person who handed on a Moga (28:50 - 28:57)
though somebody electric professor Elmen (28:53 - 29:02)
is Emolga stop your nonsense so ill out (28:57 - 29:04)
of curiosity I guess you downloaded (29:02 - 29:07)
masters yeah you like it so far because (29:04 - 29:09)
I was told for several weeks that I (29:07 - 29:11)
should at least log in and get my gems (29:09 - 29:13)
and whatever that weird comic book (29:11 - 29:16)
looking thing is so I've been doing that (29:13 - 29:18)
oh and well when when do I get to talk (29:16 - 29:21)

time I am here with dr. lava from lava (30:34 - 30:41)
cut content calm how are you doing good (30:37 - 30:43)
how you doing Steve I'm good I'm good (30:41 - 30:46)
it's funny cuz you were you connected (30:43 - 30:49)
with me like almost a year ago and we (30:46 - 30:52)
are now getting to this so I apologize (30:49 - 30:54)
for the delay (30:52 - 30:55)
that's all good things before a sword (30:54 - 30:58)
and shield were super hectic so that was (30:55 - 31:00)
my bed it's all good I got more (30:58 - 31:01)
interesting stuff to talk about now than (31:00 - 31:04)
I did a year ago anyway that's true your (31:01 - 31:06)
site's really blown up so Before we jump (31:04 - 31:08)
into what we're gonna talk about if (31:06 - 31:11)
somebody has not heard of lava cut (31:08 - 31:14)
content or yourself who are you and what (31:11 - 31:17)
do you do well I'm an evil scientist (31:14 - 31:19)
first and foremost but my spare time I (31:17 - 31:22)
like to kind of guess you'd say catalog (31:19 - 31:26)
Pokemon content content in the (31:22 - 31:28)
traditional sense as well as just sort (31:26 - 31:32)
of unused ideas I also do a lot with (31:28 - 31:36)
kind of beta content and leaks not leaks (31:32 - 31:37)
as far as like what's gonna happen the (31:36 - 31:38)
sword and shield next (31:37 - 31:42)
but like leaks of stuff that beta (31:38 - 31:44)
content from stuff like you know Gen one (31:42 - 31:47)
to four more recently just kind of cuz (31:44 - 31:50)
there have been quite a few leaks of old (31:47 - 31:53)
you know 20 year old Pokemon demos and (31:50 - 31:54)
that kind of thing over the past year or (31:53 - 31:55)
two (31:54 - 31:59)
so yeah japan-exclusive [ __ ] just japan (31:55 - 32:02)
exclusive content cut content also do (31:59 - 32:05)
translations of old japanese developer (32:02 - 32:08)
interviews that kind of thing i noticed (32:05 - 32:10)
you said 1 to 4 is there a reason that (32:08 - 32:13)
gen 3 you just kind of skipped over well (32:10 - 32:16)
there hasn't really been a week of not (32:13 - 32:19)
on the scale of what we've had four one (32:16 - 32:22)
two and four although I do suspect that (32:19 - 32:26)
some stuff from gen 3 will leak one of (32:22 - 32:28)
these days because of that worth what (32:26 - 32:31)
the source of the of the other leaks (32:28 - 32:34)
came from I suspect that the well I (32:31 - 32:35)
guess I was guess we're gonna say this (32:34 - 32:37)
for later bow is go ahead and get into (32:35 - 32:38)
it you know it was a head (32:37 - 32:40)
someone hacked into Nintendo servers (32:38 - 32:44)
back in 2017 got a whole bunch of kind (32:40 - 32:47)
of development assets not just from (32:44 - 32:49)
Pokemon but from a lot of stuff actually (32:47 - 32:52)
but will the stick with Pokemon so the (32:49 - 32:56)
stuff from 1 2 & 4 has been made public (32:52 - 32:59)
at least most of it but nothing from gen (32:56 - 33:02)
3 yet but I suspect that it was also (32:59 - 33:05)
hacked and just hasn't surfaced yet like (33:02 - 33:08)
the other stuff so the first time we (33:05 - 33:09)
talked about your stuff was just a (33:08 - 33:13)
couple weeks ago it was the Gen 4 leaked (33:09 - 33:17)
hundreds of gendered beta sprites mmm I (33:13 - 33:20)
guess we came with it from like complete (33:17 - 33:23)
transparency we came with it as like we (33:20 - 33:24)
don't know if this is real we don't know (33:23 - 33:27)
if this is false because like in the (33:24 - 33:29)
Pokemon world if it's not on Sara B and (33:27 - 33:31)
some public pedia people just kind of (33:29 - 33:33)
like shrug their shoulders and was like (33:31 - 33:35)
we don't know if this is real or not but (33:33 - 33:38)
you kind of proven over the last well (33:35 - 33:39)
how about almost two years you've been (33:38 - 33:41)
doing this right uh a year and a half (33:39 - 33:43)
something like that yeah it seems like (33:41 - 33:44)
there's a lot of there's a lot of (33:43 - 33:46)
in-depth stuff that you definitely go (33:44 - 33:49)
into but do you still get that from your (33:46 - 33:51)
audience of like why should we believe (33:49 - 33:51)
you (33:51 - 33:54)
um I think most people have followed me (33:51 - 33:57)
for a while have kind of come to accept (33:54 - 33:58)
it the people have read the articles my (33:57 - 34:00)
website of course I'll have random (33:58 - 34:02)
comments from time to time live seems (34:00 - 34:05)
like BS to me but you know the the case (34:02 - 34:08)
is pretty strong and you know that stuff (34:05 - 34:11)
for example that the most well known of (34:08 - 34:13)
the leaks the gold and silver of 1997 (34:11 - 34:16)
demo that's a space broad one right (34:13 - 34:18)
right space world it was the demo (34:16 - 34:21)
exhibited at the space world 1997 (34:18 - 34:23)
Stoffel often referred to as a space (34:21 - 34:26)
world demo but it's not on Bulba pedia (34:23 - 34:30)
but it's my understanding that the I (34:26 - 34:33)
guess non port of directors I forget the (34:30 - 34:34)
exact term but basically the board of (34:33 - 34:37)
directors from Bulba pedia seldomly (34:34 - 34:40)
meets and they they're the ones that (34:37 - 34:42)
would approve that kind of thing being (34:40 - 34:44)
put on Bulba pedia but I've spoken with (34:42 - 34:46)
some Bubba pedia moderators they think (34:44 - 34:49)
space world is true there's been footage (34:46 - 34:51)
that surfaced after the (34:49 - 34:54)
that confirmed what was in the leak and (34:51 - 34:56)
also we've had you know we now know we (34:54 - 34:58)
didn't know this when when space world (34:56 - 35:00)
leaks but we now know the past six weeks (34:58 - 35:03)
or so that the all these leaks including (35:00 - 35:06)
space world came from March 2017 hack of (35:03 - 35:09)
Nintendo servers and that guy was the (35:06 - 35:13)
hacker was caught he was prosecuted you (35:09 - 35:18)
obviously know knows I now report on (35:13 - 35:20)
that stuff but it's not me he's you know (35:18 - 35:22)
breaking into servers and that kind of (35:20 - 35:26)
thing know wouldn't know how to and (35:22 - 35:30)
would want to do it but yeah it's pretty (35:26 - 35:32)
indisputable I would say that these gen (35:30 - 35:36)
1 2 & 4 leaks are legitimate although (35:32 - 35:38)
the the Gen 1 stuff was kind of confused (35:36 - 35:42)
by some fan-made stuff got mixed in with (35:38 - 35:44)
it but we know what's what's real and (35:42 - 35:46)
what's not and the leaks are legitimate (35:44 - 35:48)
you're doing all this on your own and (35:46 - 35:49)
I'm from my understanding you don't (35:48 - 35:51)
speak Japanese so you have to actually (35:49 - 35:53)
pay translators and stuff so with all of (35:51 - 35:56)
that like what got you into reporting on (35:53 - 35:57)
this stuff because this is something (35:56 - 35:58)
really cool this is something I would (35:57 - 36:00)
have liked I am the person that cares (35:58 - 36:03)
about the the silly difference between (36:00 - 36:05)
like oh this is a mythical this is not a (36:03 - 36:08)
mythical this is right this is how you (36:05 - 36:11)
actually say the pokemons name I like I (36:08 - 36:12)
care about I know most people don't (36:11 - 36:14)
right but I care about that trivia stuff (36:12 - 36:17)
and I like to know the history of how (36:14 - 36:19)
these things happened or how we got to (36:17 - 36:21)
the point or why Game Freak makes the (36:19 - 36:24)
decisions they do well I first started (36:21 - 36:26)
making just some kind of Nintendo cut (36:24 - 36:29)
content I started with Metroid Prime I (36:26 - 36:32)
did Zelda Mario a few other games and (36:29 - 36:36)
then after I did Mario 64 on YouTube I (36:32 - 36:38)
was like you know I'll do pokémon red (36:36 - 36:40)
and blue like probably won't get many (36:38 - 36:42)
views cuz it's like a 25 year old game (36:40 - 36:45)
at this point but you know I guess I'll (36:42 - 36:46)
just make a Pokemon game I like Pokemon (36:45 - 36:48)
I've always loved Pokemon so I made one (36:46 - 36:51)
video about pokemon red and blues cut (36:48 - 36:53)
content and I kind of blew up got you (36:51 - 36:55)
know over 100,000 views which was a lot (36:53 - 36:58)
more than I had been getting so that (36:55 - 36:59)
maybe I'll make one more Pokemon video (36:58 - 37:02)
and they got you know some traction as (36:59 - 37:04)
well and I was like okay well maybe I'll (37:02 - 37:05)
just stay (37:04 - 37:06)
with this for a little while and then (37:05 - 37:08)
you know about a year and a half's come (37:06 - 37:11)
by now and and people seem to care a lot (37:08 - 37:13)
more when I talk about Pokemon tech (37:11 - 37:16)
content than anything else so I kind of (37:13 - 37:18)
stuck with it and you know I've been a (37:16 - 37:20)
big Pokemon fan since I was 10 years old (37:18 - 37:22)
and I used to be really into the card (37:20 - 37:24)
game I went to the World Championships (37:22 - 37:27)
so didn't do very well but big Pokemon (37:24 - 37:29)
fan for a long time and just seemed like (37:27 - 37:30)
there was kind of I guess you could say (37:29 - 37:32)
like a hole in the market there are (37:30 - 37:34)
there are other people doing it I want (37:32 - 37:36)
to shout out some people probably later (37:34 - 37:37)
in this episode there are other people (37:36 - 37:40)
who do it but they're kind of no (37:37 - 37:42)
disrespect to them but kind of (37:40 - 37:44)
splintered and the people who do do it (37:42 - 37:47)
even do a good job don't have the best (37:44 - 37:49)
presentation yeah you know there would (37:47 - 37:51)
be something like an info dump and you (37:49 - 37:55)
know most people would rather see you (37:51 - 37:58)
know a tweets worth of information or (37:55 - 38:00)
YouTube videos worth of information than (37:58 - 38:02)
just have you know pages and pages and (38:00 - 38:06)
pages of sort of like try you know info (38:02 - 38:08)
dump at their fingertips so a lot of (38:06 - 38:11)
what I do is take stuff that was leaked (38:08 - 38:13)
or by other people and then kind of try (38:11 - 38:16)
and condense it into presentable format (38:13 - 38:19)
presentable is is definitely what people (38:16 - 38:22)
look for it sometimes like case in point (38:19 - 38:23)
you know the Pokemon go community they (38:22 - 38:25)
love their infographics and that was (38:23 - 38:27)
just a thing that blew up in that (38:25 - 38:31)
community and like a clean infographic (38:27 - 38:32)
about like that infos out there right (38:31 - 38:34)
like this Pokemon is weak to this and (38:32 - 38:35)
this and this and this and it's gonna (38:34 - 38:37)
show up from 10:00 to 12:00 and it's (38:35 - 38:40)
like you can find that info pretty (38:37 - 38:43)
easily but they love it when it's (38:40 - 38:47)
presented in a P&G 10 by 10 inch thread (38:43 - 38:50)
we're on Twitter or on Instagram and (38:47 - 38:52)
stuff so like presentation goes a long (38:50 - 38:55)
way and and so when you when we hit this (38:52 - 38:57)
Gen 4 leak hundreds of gendered beta (38:55 - 38:59)
sprites this is very easy to follow very (38:57 - 39:02)
easy to read so yeah let's uh let's get (38:59 - 39:04)
into this so this was the one with uh (39:02 - 39:08)
like female Pikachu with the heart tail (39:04 - 39:10)
butt down ears female ride shoe with (39:08 - 39:13)
down ears which that the the ear Park I (39:10 - 39:15)
cut but the tail stayed the same on the (39:13 - 39:17)
Pikachu so yeah we can talk about sort (39:15 - 39:18)
of how (39:17 - 39:21)
happened and I guess more this story of (39:18 - 39:24)
the leak rather than you know describing (39:21 - 39:28)
the ears of all the female variants so I (39:24 - 39:29)
guess I kinda have to start at the end (39:28 - 39:31)
to get back to the beginning so when the (39:29 - 39:32)
you know first there was a space world (39:31 - 39:35)
link leak back in 2018 (39:32 - 39:38)
and then there was a Gen 1 leak which is (39:35 - 39:40)
published by helix chamber and early (39:38 - 39:43)
2019 and then in this past December (39:40 - 39:46)
there was a gem for beta sprite leak (39:43 - 39:49)
which first leaked on Forge hands VP (39:46 - 39:51)
board not sure if you're familiar but I (39:49 - 39:54)
know for Chan I stay far far away from (39:51 - 39:57)
it well I don't spend too much time on (39:54 - 40:01)
there but they do you know credit where (39:57 - 40:03)
it's where it's due there is a lot of (40:01 - 40:06)
interesting kind of beta Pokemon (40:03 - 40:08)
discussion as well as in this case an (40:06 - 40:11)
actual leak that happens over there on (40:08 - 40:15)
4chan so you know my honor they they use (40:11 - 40:17)
rude words it's for sure but they do (40:15 - 40:20)
kind of play you know sort of an (40:17 - 40:23)
important part in the Pokemon beta (40:20 - 40:26)
content community I would say but anyway (40:23 - 40:30)
so there was this leak someone posted (40:26 - 40:33)
the who we now know but at the time (40:30 - 40:37)
didn't know who it was posted a link to (40:33 - 40:39)
a web site a weird web site that had (40:37 - 40:42)
hundreds of Gen 4 beta sprites on it and (40:39 - 40:44)
of course everyone on 4chan was you know (40:42 - 40:47)
skeptical of course but it seemed to be (40:44 - 40:49)
legitimate just on the face of it and (40:47 - 40:54)
then it was about 24 hours it was taken (40:49 - 40:57)
offline and I'm getting into contact (40:54 - 40:59)
with the guy who owns that web site that (40:57 - 41:01)
had the beta sprites on it yeah I talked (40:59 - 41:06)
to him and there's some details won't go (41:01 - 41:08)
into but a few days after that that (41:06 - 41:09)
person I talked to you own the website (41:08 - 41:11)
posted I guess you would say a (41:09 - 41:14)
confession I hope I'm not miss character (41:11 - 41:16)
just characterizing it but he did say (41:14 - 41:18)
sorry and kind of tell the truth so I (41:16 - 41:20)
think it's fair to frame it as a (41:18 - 41:20)
confession (41:20 - 41:22)
sure so anyway this the guy who owned (41:20 - 41:24)
the web site the Gen 4 beta sprites were (41:22 - 41:26)
on he posted confession on glitched city (41:24 - 41:28)
which said which basically told the (41:26 - 41:30)
story of how these leaks happened what (41:28 - 41:31)
who played (41:30 - 41:34)
part I have to apologize I keep (41:31 - 41:37)
referring to this person is he they (41:34 - 41:39)
actually prefer to be referred to as (41:37 - 41:41)
they so I'll probably accidentally say (41:39 - 41:44)
he but this person does preferred (41:41 - 41:47)
they/them pronouns so forgiven if I slip (41:44 - 41:50)
out of that just out of habit but this (41:47 - 41:54)
person known as Ganic s-- online posted (41:50 - 41:56)
the confession saying that how it (41:54 - 41:58)
happened was there was another (41:56 - 42:02)
individual security researcher by trade (41:58 - 42:05)
who online that has a number of aliases (42:02 - 42:09)
but the one used in this context their (42:05 - 42:12)
alias is whacko i don't want to use (42:09 - 42:15)
their real name but they hacked into (42:12 - 42:19)
both Nintendo and Microsoft servers and (42:15 - 42:23)
March 2017 and then were caught in May (42:19 - 42:27)
25th two months later in May 2017 they (42:23 - 42:29)
were prosecuted ended up getting off (42:27 - 42:33)
pretty light didn't get jail time I hope (42:29 - 42:35)
this isn't improper to say but it's my (42:33 - 42:37)
understanding that a disrespect of (42:35 - 42:38)
course but it's my understanding that (42:37 - 42:40)
one of the reasons they were let off is (42:38 - 42:44)
because they're autistic and the judge (42:40 - 42:47)
limited their internet use and decided (42:44 - 42:49)
that they weren't you know a general (42:47 - 42:52)
threat to you know society so this (42:49 - 42:54)
person did not wacko did not get jail (42:52 - 42:59)
time fortunately but is Wakko United (42:54 - 43:02)
States or a different country cuz I (42:59 - 43:04)
guess that would be different I suppose (43:02 - 43:07)
depending on how they were or do we not (43:04 - 43:12)
know it's in the public record I want to (43:07 - 43:14)
say British okay can't say there's a (43:12 - 43:15)
hunt (43:14 - 43:17)
confidence because I may be forgiving I (43:15 - 43:19)
wanna say British though but regardless (43:17 - 43:22)
so the way it happened was this person (43:19 - 43:26)
wacko a hacked these servers and I guess (43:22 - 43:29)
had a particular interest in Pokemon you (43:26 - 43:30)
know the most famed kind of the most (43:29 - 43:34)
sought-after maybe legendary demo of all (43:30 - 43:36)
time in all video games is the space (43:34 - 43:38)
world 1997 demo of gold and silver which (43:36 - 43:40)
is you know rumors been going around for (43:38 - 43:43)
years the people drawing what they saw (43:40 - 43:45)
fan art saying a lot (43:43 - 43:46)
come on that looks like this it was in (43:45 - 43:48)
the release version and it gotten kind (43:46 - 43:50)
of legendary over the past 20 years or (43:48 - 43:52)
so so that was I guess kind of top (43:50 - 43:56)
priority for wakko so what Wanko did was (43:52 - 43:58)
there's a discord server that a lot of (43:56 - 44:02)
kind of you know like a prototype beta (43:58 - 44:05)
content enthusiasts use called a pret (44:02 - 44:09)
discord server and so Wakko created like (44:05 - 44:12)
an alternate count and on an anonymous (44:09 - 44:16)
account dropped off the the ROM for the (44:12 - 44:19)
spatial demo and with a limit of 20 (44:16 - 44:22)
downloads and then turned around and (44:19 - 44:26)
logged into his regular account along (44:22 - 44:28)
with jnx the person who made this (44:26 - 44:30)
confession has relayed this story to us (44:28 - 44:34)
they both downloaded got two of those 20 (44:30 - 44:36)
downloads but you know who dropped this (44:34 - 44:38)
off pretending that it wasn't them who (44:36 - 44:39)
done it (44:38 - 44:42)
and then they those 20 people became (44:39 - 44:44)
what's now known as team space world (44:42 - 44:46)
they pulled in a few other translators (44:44 - 44:49)
and people like that and they dissected (44:46 - 44:52)
the demo and that's how we you know came (44:49 - 44:55)
to know what was in the demo so this (44:52 - 44:57)
essentially janux (44:55 - 45:00)
and Wakko were lying about not knowing (44:57 - 45:02)
where it came from because I knew (45:00 - 45:05)
exactly where it came from and I was (45:02 - 45:06)
shortly after that I believe if I'm (45:05 - 45:09)
getting my timeline right that Wakko was (45:06 - 45:11)
caught and prosecuted is now under (45:09 - 45:15)
limited internet access and then Wakko (45:11 - 45:17)
gave a bunch of the other prototype beta (45:15 - 45:21)
assets to janux who distributed some of (45:17 - 45:24)
it to Helix chamber the Gen 1 stuff sure (45:21 - 45:28)
eventually leaked the Gen 4 stuff on (45:24 - 45:32)
4chan and and yeah that's basically the (45:28 - 45:34)
story which is it all came from that (45:32 - 45:36)
Nintendo hack person was prosecuted and (45:34 - 45:38)
it's my understanding that there are (45:36 - 45:41)
still a lot more of the stuff that came (45:38 - 45:43)
from that hack that has not been made (45:41 - 45:46)
public and I would imagine some gen 3 (45:43 - 45:48)
stuff would be in there and who knows (45:46 - 45:50)
what else probably lots of non Pokemon (45:48 - 45:52)
stuff sure Microsoft actually was also (45:50 - 45:55)
hacked but I guess we'll just stick with (45:52 - 45:57)
Pokemon for this conversation (45:55 - 45:58)
so the (45:57 - 46:00)
still a lot more out there some of it (45:58 - 46:02)
I've heard rumblings about and some that (46:00 - 46:05)
I just I'm sure I have no idea about so (46:02 - 46:07)
high it's been an exciting time to be in (46:05 - 46:10)
the you know beta content Pokemon biz (46:07 - 46:13)
and so much has come out of that week (46:10 - 46:15)
that of that hack and I think there's (46:13 - 46:16)
still more to come probably in the next (46:15 - 46:19)
you know coming years specifically for (46:16 - 46:21)
like the gen 4 stuff is there still (46:19 - 46:23)
stuff coming or does everything that you (46:21 - 46:27)
have up here kind of all of it or was (46:23 - 46:28)
there as so much that we're like slowly (46:27 - 46:33)
filtering through as far as Gen 4 I (46:28 - 46:35)
pretty sure the only thing that has been (46:33 - 46:38)
made public or a few shiny sprites (46:35 - 46:41)
shinies of sprites that were already in (46:38 - 46:45)
the leaked janux actually gave those to (46:41 - 46:47)
me but I haven't published them because (46:45 - 46:49)
I was kind of afraid I'd be crossing the (46:47 - 46:53)
line and maybe I would be open to some (46:49 - 46:57)
legal prosecution yeah I was gonna ask (46:53 - 46:59)
that if you like feel like you're in (46:57 - 47:01)
this weird middle ground where somebody (46:59 - 47:03)
was already prosecuted about having this (47:01 - 47:05)
information and now you're publishing (47:03 - 47:07)
the information from I don't even know I (47:05 - 47:09)
like first and secondhand third-hand (47:07 - 47:11)
source right so you know when I'm (47:09 - 47:13)
reporting on what's been leaked at I'm (47:11 - 47:16)
pretty sure I'm legally just fine right (47:13 - 47:18)
but if I'm the first person to publish (47:16 - 47:23)
these hacked sprites then I I'm not a (47:18 - 47:24)
lawyer and I don't really have a lawyer (47:23 - 47:26)
so I'm but I feel like that would (47:24 - 47:29)
probably be crossing a line into being (47:26 - 47:33)
liable so I have not distributed those (47:29 - 47:37)
those hats shiny sprites from the Gen 4 (47:33 - 47:39)
League okay so like with the the jet for (47:37 - 47:42)
leak again is there is there anything (47:39 - 47:44)
else here that signifies like why this (47:42 - 47:47)
stuff was cut I mean we have there like (47:44 - 47:48)
the different Charizard it's the (47:47 - 47:50)
different side X you know the different (47:48 - 47:53)
Pikachu's again I guess going back to (47:50 - 47:54)
the aina and I forgive me because I'm (47:53 - 47:57)
not a hacker either but is like there's (47:54 - 48:00)
something like notes or something that (47:57 - 48:03)
we're also pulled that maybe like maybe (48:00 - 48:05)
we'll save this for later or maybe this (48:03 - 48:07)
just isn't ready I don't think there (48:05 - 48:10)
were any notes extracted from the hack (48:07 - 48:13)
someone again like I said 4chan does (48:10 - 48:15)
serve its purpose despite using some (48:13 - 48:18)
naughty words but someone on 4chan did (48:15 - 48:19)
point out and I included this and and (48:18 - 48:21)
one of my two articles covering that Gen (48:19 - 48:23)
four League there's an issue of coral (48:21 - 48:27)
Cora magazine from shortly before Gen (48:23 - 48:29)
fours release where they quote Game (48:27 - 48:32)
Freak saying that all Pokemon will have (48:29 - 48:35)
gender differences or at least most of (48:32 - 48:38)
them will have gender differences of (48:35 - 48:39)
course and the release version I think (48:38 - 48:41)
it was something like eighty of the you (48:39 - 48:44)
know four hundred some-odd Pokemon ended (48:41 - 48:46)
up with with gender differences and now (48:44 - 48:49)
this league shows this gives us a peek (48:46 - 48:51)
at what they were thinking when they (48:49 - 48:53)
were considering giving nearly every (48:51 - 48:56)
Pokemon the gender differences and (48:53 - 48:58)
speculated my article as far as why they (48:56 - 49:00)
would throw out that idea which is (48:58 - 49:03)
probably just that they realize it was a (49:00 - 49:04)
lot of extra work to make all these (49:03 - 49:08)
animated sprites with with you know of (49:04 - 49:11)
two of each one and I don't think it (49:08 - 49:13)
probably wouldn't have you know sold any (49:11 - 49:16)
extra copies no one was gonna say we all (49:13 - 49:18)
buy that new Pokemon game because of the (49:16 - 49:19)
gender differences I wouldn't think that (49:18 - 49:22)
would make a big difference in sales and (49:19 - 49:24)
then yeah I'm sure they're probably (49:22 - 49:25)
looking to the future when it was time (49:24 - 49:28)
to make 3d models and future generations (49:25 - 49:29)
and they're thinking oh do we really (49:28 - 49:31)
want to have you know a thousand Pokemon (49:29 - 49:35)
two versions of everyone making all this (49:31 - 49:37)
extra work for ourselves and not really (49:35 - 49:40)
making the extra money and at that point (49:37 - 49:44)
they decided to sharply you know curb (49:40 - 49:46)
their idea of giving so many Pokemon (49:44 - 49:48)
gender differences that's that's my (49:46 - 49:51)
theory it is cool to see like how I mean (49:48 - 49:52)
this just definitely seemed pretty (49:51 - 49:56)
ambitious and as somebody who like me (49:52 - 49:59)
primarily I like love collecting Pokemon (49:56 - 50:01)
I'm the I'm the dude that I was like (49:59 - 50:03)
well I need every I'll crap me form so (50:01 - 50:06)
that's 63 not including shiny so I guess (50:03 - 50:09)
this is what I'm doing right I'm one of (50:06 - 50:11)
the guys who collects them all not one (50:09 - 50:13)
of the one who you know max is added (50:11 - 50:15)
stats I'm right getting the full living (50:13 - 50:18)
pokedex yeah you're pretty confident in (50:15 - 50:19)
this reporting you're pretty confident (50:18 - 50:21)
of everything that you you know you (50:19 - 50:23)
reported on here (50:21 - 50:25)
how does that tie in then with some of (50:23 - 50:28)
the you know the other stuff like I (50:25 - 50:31)
guess going jumping a little bit back to (50:28 - 50:34)
the space world stuff with all those (50:31 - 50:35)
baby Pokemon that were cut like baby (50:34 - 50:38)
mouths or the evolution of far fetch is (50:35 - 50:41)
it kind of just the the same the same (50:38 - 50:43)
situation these things were just cut we (50:41 - 50:44)
don't really have a reason for it (50:43 - 50:46)
besides you know maybe it was too much (50:44 - 50:47)
work or maybe they didn't have the space (50:46 - 50:49)
or maybe they didn't have the time or is (50:47 - 50:51)
that a slightly different story it's (50:49 - 50:53)
kind of different in different cases so (50:51 - 50:56)
like for space world demo you know (50:53 - 50:59)
originally junichi Masuda the series (50:56 - 51:03)
director has said that they worked after (50:59 - 51:05)
they completed red and green they were (51:03 - 51:08)
working on blue yellow gold and silver (51:05 - 51:11)
all simultaneously and they were (51:08 - 51:12)
originally planning on gold and silver (51:11 - 51:16)
to launch in 1998 the space world demo (51:12 - 51:20)
was exhibited in November 97 so I think (51:16 - 51:22)
at that point they were thinking it (51:20 - 51:25)
wasn't far off things end up getting (51:22 - 51:27)
delayed and I could we go into this (51:25 - 51:32)
pretty deep I just try not to be too (51:27 - 51:35)
long-winded here but it makes they end (51:32 - 51:37)
up getting delayed and in that time (51:35 - 51:40)
because you know Ken Sugimori the lead (51:37 - 51:43)
master designer an art director he said (51:40 - 51:46)
that gen 2 they made several hundred (51:43 - 51:48)
Pokemon but they cut most of them or (51:46 - 51:50)
this you know didn't use most of them (51:48 - 51:51)
and just willed it down to a hundred so (51:50 - 51:55)
I think the spatial demo is something (51:51 - 51:58)
like a snapshot in time when they (51:55 - 52:00)
thought that they'd be releasing the (51:58 - 52:03)
game fairly soon these works were like (52:00 - 52:05)
the top 100 Pokemon that they'd come up (52:03 - 52:07)
with at that point and then the games (52:05 - 52:10)
end up getting delayed it took two years (52:07 - 52:14)
and so by that time they'd had another (52:10 - 52:16)
top hundred and they decided I would (52:14 - 52:18)
assume you know we don't need 17 baby (52:16 - 52:21)
Pokemon in this list of new 100 Pokemon (52:18 - 52:23)
so let's Whittle it down to seven yeah (52:21 - 52:27)
yeah I'm sure each Pokemon that was Cod (52:23 - 52:30)
had had various you know reasonings but (52:27 - 52:32)
um I think it mostly just comes down to (52:30 - 52:34)
those were the hundred best they had at (52:32 - 52:36)
the time and then two years later they (52:34 - 52:36)
had (52:36 - 52:38)
they're top hundred list you heard it (52:36 - 52:42)
here first qwilfish a hundred best oh (52:38 - 52:42)
you got me run the mill of it drink a (52:43 - 52:49)
coffee there there's a lot of debate (52:46 - 52:52)
about shiny colors and how they were (52:49 - 52:54)
just automatically generated back in the (52:52 - 52:56)
day and they weren't like hand-picked I (52:54 - 52:58)
think at one point somebody said they (52:56 - 53:00)
started hand picking Chinese and like (52:58 - 53:03)
Gen 5 maybe you know actually I'm that's (53:00 - 53:04)
a good good thing to bring it up cuz (53:03 - 53:06)
actually I had been misinformed about (53:04 - 53:09)
this for a long time because I dread you (53:06 - 53:10)
know all over the internet that they (53:09 - 53:13)
were determined by some kind of knife or (53:10 - 53:16)
an algorithm or just automatic palette (53:13 - 53:18)
swap or something to that effect and (53:16 - 53:20)
basically that they weren't manually (53:18 - 53:22)
chosen I dread that for a long time and (53:20 - 53:24)
you know supposedly it was until they (53:22 - 53:26)
moved the 3d models or sometime around (53:24 - 53:27)
that time period that they started hand (53:26 - 53:30)
picking them but I just recently (53:27 - 53:36)
actually was corrected by a former team (53:30 - 53:38)
space world member goes by the name rom (53:36 - 53:42)
hacking carrot that's his online alias (53:38 - 53:46)
he's he was in team space world and he (53:42 - 53:49)
is a Gentoo disassembler he makes rom (53:46 - 53:52)
hacks - Chen - that kind of thing so he (53:49 - 53:53)
is one of those people who's you know (53:52 - 53:55)
spinning around in his computer chair (53:53 - 53:58)
hacking into well into games not in the (53:55 - 54:02)
servers but and he told me this I later (53:58 - 54:04)
had it confirmed by someone else with (54:02 - 54:07)
the technical know-how that there is the (54:04 - 54:09)
you know internal data does show that (54:07 - 54:12)
they were hand-picked from the very (54:09 - 54:13)
start the only time that they were (54:12 - 54:14)
determined by some kind of a palette (54:13 - 54:18)
swap was in the space world demo but in (54:14 - 54:20)
the gen 2 release version gold and (54:18 - 54:23)
silver they were manually chosen and and (54:20 - 54:26)
they always have been although they did (54:23 - 54:30)
reuse some palettes which is maybe why (54:26 - 54:32)
sometimes you'll see oh well this blue (54:30 - 54:34)
pokemon and this blue pokemon both have (54:32 - 54:38)
pink shinies in those instances it's a (54:34 - 54:41)
matter of you know them sort of you know (54:38 - 54:43)
maybe we're lazily reusing those (54:41 - 54:47)
palettes yeah they actually did mainly (54:43 - 54:49)
the developers did choose (54:47 - 54:50)
every Pokemon shiny color from the very (54:49 - 54:54)
start but and also after they told me (54:50 - 54:57)
this I looked and compared some sprites (54:54 - 54:58)
from different generations even in Gen 2 (54:57 - 55:01)
you look at you know say like Meowth (54:58 - 55:03)
same for us (55:01 - 55:06)
and I think was right you were the three (55:03 - 55:07)
examples I posted on Twitter where (55:06 - 55:09)
they're all their main color is all (55:07 - 55:11)
yellow but they're all different colors (55:09 - 55:14)
and their shiny colors are all different (55:11 - 55:19)
which would seem to back up these ROM (55:14 - 55:21)
hackers claims that that that they're (55:19 - 55:23)
not predetermined palette swaps you know (55:21 - 55:27)
that yellow was always green there yeah (55:23 - 55:29)
we was always paying her what have you (55:27 - 55:31)
so one of the the newer articles you (55:29 - 55:33)
have sorry we're jumping around one of (55:31 - 55:35)
the newer articles you have talks about (55:33 - 55:37)
the Gen 5 starters (55:35 - 55:41)
right this pretty good read oh thanks (55:37 - 55:45)
yeah that was so in Japan they have a (55:41 - 55:48)
magazine called Nintendo dream which is (55:45 - 55:51)
kind of like the Japanese version of (55:48 - 55:53)
what we used to have in the u.s. called (55:51 - 55:57)
Nintendo power except they had you know (55:53 - 56:00)
more of a direct connection to to people (55:57 - 56:01)
like Game Freak a Nintendo was a (56:00 - 56:06)
Nintendo Power was more not as closely (56:01 - 56:08)
connected just because you know people (56:06 - 56:09)
weren't connect you know Japan and (56:08 - 56:11)
America wearing is connected by things (56:09 - 56:12)
like the internet and so forth in the (56:11 - 56:15)
90s but anyway so Nintendo power back (56:12 - 56:18)
around the time of Gen 5s release did a (56:15 - 56:21)
series of interviews of the course of (56:18 - 56:23)
several magazines with Ken Sugimori and (56:21 - 56:27)
a couple other Pokemon designers who (56:23 - 56:30)
basically describe the design origins of (56:27 - 56:34)
most of the Gen 5 Pokemon about 100 110 (56:30 - 56:36)
of them or so out of the hundred (56:34 - 56:39)
fifty-six so there's some interesting (56:36 - 56:41)
information in there they described some (56:39 - 56:45)
scrap Pokemon they decide described some (56:41 - 56:47)
early designs of Pokemon that did make (56:45 - 56:51)
into the game for example he said (56:47 - 56:52)
earlier that you're really into (56:51 - 56:54)
pronouncing Pokemon names right I always (56:52 - 56:56)
mispronounce them wrong so you give me (56:54 - 56:59)
but but just cuz all this stuff I read (56:56 - 57:01)
on the internet or I'm playing the game (56:59 - 57:04)
I read the name and and you don't really (57:01 - 57:06)
watch the anime so right yes I'll say (57:04 - 57:09)
the names wrong 99% of times so forgive (57:06 - 57:12)
me no worries but but (57:09 - 57:13)
so he says dwell and the Ken Sugimori (57:12 - 57:17)
says that dwell on crustal were (57:13 - 57:21)
originally furnace Pokemon with shells (57:17 - 57:26)
made out of ceramic pottery a kiln fired (57:21 - 57:28)
pottery and presumably would have been (57:26 - 57:30)
fired the half fire type although he (57:28 - 57:32)
doesn't say that necessarily but as (57:30 - 57:34)
furnace Pokemon I would assume that it's (57:32 - 57:36)
likely that they would have been at (57:34 - 57:40)
least half fire yeah I also have kind of (57:36 - 57:42)
a pet theory that the reason that dwells (57:40 - 57:46)
shiny is red is kind of a callback to I (57:42 - 57:48)
would imagine he was probably originally (57:46 - 57:52)
read as a furnace Pokemon he doesn't say (57:48 - 57:54)
that Ken's Sookie more doesn't say that (57:52 - 57:56)
but I think that's probably a safe (57:54 - 57:58)
assumption that they were red fire (57:56 - 57:59)
pokemon (57:58 - 58:02)
but anyway so Ken Sugimori these other (57:59 - 58:06)
two developers to talk about basically (58:02 - 58:08)
the development of all the mostly Gen 5 (58:06 - 58:12)
Pokemon they say that Amber is based on (58:08 - 58:16)
zhang FEI from the chinese epic romance (58:12 - 58:18)
the three kingdoms (58:16 - 58:21)
zhang FEI is kind of like a drunken (58:18 - 58:23)
general who ends up getting assassinated (58:21 - 58:27)
by his own soldiers he also says that (58:23 - 58:30)
the three starter lines in Gen 5 were (58:27 - 58:33)
meant to represent Japan China and the (58:30 - 58:37)
West with superior being a European (58:33 - 58:40)
night and more of course being a Chinese (58:37 - 58:44)
general and actually not samer odd the (58:40 - 58:47)
Duat is meant to be a samurai they also (58:44 - 58:52)
go into how when they were making up the (58:47 - 58:56)
otter family that is the Oshawa line how (58:52 - 58:57)
is kind of coincidental they couldn't (58:56 - 58:59)
they didn't want to just make bigger and (58:57 - 59:01)
bigger otters so one of the designers (58:59 - 59:04)
went to the zoo to see otters to come up (59:01 - 59:06)
with some ideas and there just happened (59:04 - 59:09)
to be a live sea lion show next to the (59:06 - 59:12)
the otter exhibit and so he was like (59:09 - 59:17)
what if we had the otter evolved into a (59:12 - 59:20)
sea lion which I think for what I can (59:17 - 59:22)
tell from Twitter most people don't (59:20 - 59:23)
really like that idea but that's that's (59:22 - 59:25)
a tandem happening camera does not (59:23 - 59:28)
really loved that much unfortunately I (59:25 - 59:31)
when I've tweeted about this this how (59:28 - 59:33)
this visit to the zoo ended up leading (59:31 - 59:36)
to samraat I always get commenting (59:33 - 59:37)
something like how versus you had been (59:36 - 59:42)
closed that day or well it's funny (59:37 - 59:44)
because I don't know if enough you've (59:42 - 59:47)
ever seen Digimon or sus or whatnot but (59:44 - 59:50)
Gollum on which is an otter like Digimon (59:47 - 59:53)
evolves into Iike cumin which looks very (59:50 - 59:55)
much like samurai so and I kind of put (59:53 - 59:57)
those two together I'm not sure if (59:55 - 59:59)
that's like those designs are based off (59:57 - 60:02)
something reminiscent of you know a (59:59 - 60:05)
creature in Japan Japanese lore but I (60:02 - 60:07)
was like okay I can I can accept samurai (60:05 - 60:10)
a lot more seeing that it's kind of very (60:07 - 60:13)
similar to this like Digimon family but (60:10 - 60:15)
again there's like a gamer I don't think (60:13 - 60:17)
you could have heard talk about that or (60:15 - 60:19)
say that but I would like to point out (60:17 - 60:22)
that Game Freak is very this was sort of (60:19 - 60:24)
unusual like I said I got my hands on (60:22 - 60:26)
these old Japanese magazines and paid a (60:24 - 60:28)
translator to translate them into (60:26 - 60:30)
English I'll put them on my website but (60:28 - 60:35)
other than a few exceptions Game Freak (60:30 - 60:38)
is usually very secretive about what (60:35 - 60:41)
influenced what pokemons designed the (60:38 - 60:44)
design process this is kind of (60:41 - 60:46)
interesting a few months back you know (60:44 - 60:48)
James Turner yes love James Turner (60:46 - 60:51)
he was the art director on sword and (60:48 - 60:54)
shield he's been with Game Freak since (60:51 - 60:58)
gen5 he a few months ago I went through (60:54 - 61:01)
his entire Twitter history and you know (60:58 - 61:02)
search through every tweet he'd ever (61:01 - 61:04)
made looking for development information (61:02 - 61:07)
and and he said for example again I'm (61:04 - 61:09)
gonna pronounce this wrong but nagging (61:07 - 61:12)
adele is that right noggin needle noggin (61:09 - 61:15)
hit okay noggin because it's going to be (61:12 - 61:19)
uh naga and then needle but yet naga (61:15 - 61:22)
needle it's it's look the anime said it (61:19 - 61:24)
I'm just repeating it I said it wrong (61:22 - 61:26)
all I said around for the (61:24 - 61:28)
two years but yet Nagin Adel okay well (61:26 - 61:31)
via he said that Nagin Adel someone on (61:28 - 61:33)
Twitter to asked him about Nagin a told (61:31 - 61:36)
he'd said like oh you know I was going (61:33 - 61:39)
for really sleek alien design I was very (61:36 - 61:42)
influenced by HR Giger he said his exact (61:39 - 61:45)
words were I'm a big HR Giger fan HR (61:42 - 61:48)
Giger's most famous for being the guy (61:45 - 61:51)
who designed the alien for the xenomorph (61:48 - 61:55)
things and he also said that earlier in (61:51 - 61:57)
development Naga (61:55 - 62:00)
Nadel had legs that eventually got (61:57 - 62:03)
removed from his design and yeah it (62:00 - 62:05)
seemed pretty clear that he drew (62:03 - 62:08)
inspiration from from HR Giger and (62:05 - 62:11)
probably the xenomorph specifically from (62:08 - 62:14)
those Alien films of the course of the (62:11 - 62:18)
processes of designing Naga Nadel so I (62:14 - 62:23)
so I pulled about 50 or so quotes of (62:18 - 62:24)
that kind of development information (62:23 - 62:27)
from his Twitter and then I started (62:24 - 62:29)
sharing them you know one day I'd do a (62:27 - 62:31)
couple quotes about Nagin Adel another (62:29 - 62:33)
day I do this and that some stuff I (62:31 - 62:35)
pulled from his Twitter and then I later (62:33 - 62:36)
we someone asked me like podium a source (62:35 - 62:39)
for that quote we have pulled up for you (62:36 - 62:41)
and I realized that tweet had been (62:39 - 62:45)
deleted oh oh all the tweets I've quoted (62:41 - 62:47)
had been deleted and that I've looked on (62:45 - 62:49)
socialblade and I realized that the day (62:47 - 62:52)
after I had quoted cuz I died polo the (62:49 - 62:54)
quotes all together and yeah put them in (62:52 - 62:55)
a Word document (62:54 - 62:57)
but so fortunately I still have them but (62:55 - 63:00)
apparently the day after I had posted (62:57 - 63:02)
the first of those development quotes (63:00 - 63:03)
from James Turner's Twitter he'd gone (63:02 - 63:05)
through his old his whole Twitter feed (63:03 - 63:07)
himself right after I gone through all (63:05 - 63:09)
that and he went deleted all that kind (63:07 - 63:12)
of information interesting you know (63:09 - 63:14)
what's funny is I asked James Turner it (63:12 - 63:17)
was about people and Nagin Adel I asked (63:14 - 63:20)
him shortly after ultra Sun ultramoon (63:17 - 63:23)
came out with zero expectation of him (63:20 - 63:24)
responding I asked him because this was (63:23 - 63:26)
going back to the shiny thing we brought (63:24 - 63:28)
up earlier I was like hey did you do you (63:26 - 63:30)
know who like did you I know you made (63:28 - 63:32)
people and Nagin Adel that you've cited (63:30 - 63:34)
that but did you make their shinies and (63:32 - 63:36)
he said he replied to me pretty quickly (63:34 - 63:38)
and he said yeah I made their shinies (63:36 - 63:40)
and I wanted them to look like Hornets (63:38 - 63:42)
so that's why I decided on the the (63:40 - 63:44)
yellow and black no I'm like super (63:42 - 63:46)
curious if he deleted that tweet that's (63:44 - 63:46)
funny (63:46 - 63:49)
that was that was one of the quotes that (63:46 - 63:52)
I copy/paste it was yea his response to (63:49 - 63:57)
you apparently I like I think I still (63:52 - 63:58)
have the tweet I screenshot at it (63:57 - 64:00)
because I was like oh my gosh James turn (63:58 - 64:01)
to reply ever replied to me this is so (64:00 - 64:03)
cool you should probably hold on to that (64:01 - 64:05)
because I'm pretty certain it was one I (64:03 - 64:09)
pulled from about 50 and I saw that the (64:05 - 64:11)
day after I started quoting his tweets (64:09 - 64:14)
he deleted a hundred tweets so I checked (64:11 - 64:16)
about a half dozen all the half dozen (64:14 - 64:18)
that I'd used were deleted so I would (64:16 - 64:19)
assume he delete all the ones I took (64:18 - 64:22)
plus about another 50 that you know he (64:19 - 64:24)
also want to get rid of although I guess (64:22 - 64:25)
that I didn't think we're valuable (64:24 - 64:28)
enough to copy paste but yeah I think he (64:25 - 64:30)
probably deleted his response to your (64:28 - 64:33)
tweet at this point dang it I'm so very (64:30 - 64:37)
flattered that he tweeted at me he's (64:33 - 64:38)
like one of my favorite artists in (64:37 - 64:40)
Pokemon for sure like I love all his (64:38 - 64:42)
designs well hold on to it cuz you know (64:40 - 64:43)
I you know I've covered (64:42 - 64:45)
lost Pokemon history in this case that (64:43 - 64:48)
is definitely you could consider that (64:45 - 64:49)
lost Pokemon history at this point since (64:48 - 64:52)
it was deleted by James Turner so you (64:49 - 64:55)
know you played a role and getting a (64:52 - 64:56)
little bit of information out of him and (64:55 - 64:59)
then I I guess Game Freak later came and (64:56 - 65:03)
said like hey some dick that's worth (64:59 - 65:08)
some some jerk on Twitter's been quoting (65:03 - 65:10)
your do your stuff you should have said (65:08 - 65:12)
so go to your Twitter history in the (65:10 - 65:14)
lead all that development information so (65:12 - 65:16)
you got it out of him and then he later (65:14 - 65:18)
was told to delete it so good work I (65:16 - 65:20)
think the only thing that this (65:18 - 65:22)
solidifies is we probably can't get away (65:20 - 65:24)
with asking him any questions anymore (65:22 - 65:27)
probably not none of that sort that's a (65:24 - 65:28)
bummer (65:27 - 65:30)
but we can talk a little bit more about (65:28 - 65:32)
kind of like translations and staff (65:30 - 65:34)
while we're on the topic yeah so what's (65:32 - 65:35)
interesting is like you're paying (65:34 - 65:38)
somebody to translate this stuff for you (65:35 - 65:40)
is and I kind of always wondered this (65:38 - 65:43)
with you know like like Sarah B and with (65:40 - 65:44)
bubble pedia (65:43 - 65:46)
you know being these two big resources (65:44 - 65:49)
in the Pokemon world the I hate saying (65:46 - 65:50)
this because I know it's not true but (65:49 - 65:52)
does like the the question would be does (65:50 - 65:53)
the Japanese audience (65:52 - 65:55)
care about this do they not have their (65:53 - 65:57)
own pokemon sites where they're they're (65:55 - 66:00)
easily translating their own magazines (65:57 - 66:02)
that they're getting is like I feel like (66:00 - 66:04)
that has to exist somewhere right I (66:02 - 66:08)
would think so although you know I don't (66:04 - 66:11)
speak Japanese so I've I can't just surf (66:08 - 66:13)
around the web as easily as I'd like to (66:11 - 66:16)
although I you know I live in China I (66:13 - 66:17)
have for about ten years and there's (66:16 - 66:20)
I've gotten pretty good at searching for (66:17 - 66:21)
things in other languages that I don't (66:20 - 66:24)
fully understand so what I can tell it's (66:21 - 66:28)
not very well documented for example the (66:24 - 66:29)
way I originally found out about those (66:28 - 66:32)
Nintendo dream magazine issues that talk (66:29 - 66:36)
about the Gen 5 origins was there was a (66:32 - 66:37)
now-defunct (66:36 - 66:38)
but still on the wayback machine (66:37 - 66:41)
Japanese language blog where someone had (66:38 - 66:44)
transcribed those interviews for the (66:41 - 66:47)
magazine in Bulba pedia as they (66:44 - 66:49)
sometimes do they'll cite Japanese (66:47 - 66:51)
language stuff and then I guess someone (66:49 - 66:53)
said oh it says this in English so it's (66:51 - 66:55)
untranslated they use it as a source and (66:53 - 66:58)
in this case I went and had that source (66:55 - 67:01)
translated but actually had more (66:58 - 67:03)
recently finasteride actually bought the (67:01 - 67:05)
magazines I realized that a lot of what (67:03 - 67:08)
this person had transcribed was actually (67:05 - 67:11)
summaries not actual quotes so maybe (67:08 - 67:13)
he'd summarized a paragraph into a (67:11 - 67:15)
couple sentences so I ended up having to (67:13 - 67:17)
get a lot of that stuff retranslated (67:15 - 67:20)
but as far as I can tell even in (67:17 - 67:21)
Japanese a lot of it's not too well (67:20 - 67:24)
documented which yeah it makes it (67:21 - 67:26)
necessary to actually go find the actual (67:24 - 67:31)
magazines or you know other primary (67:26 - 67:33)
source documents and actually get a (67:31 - 67:35)
professional to translate them and (67:33 - 67:37)
unfortunately doesn't seem like there's (67:35 - 67:41)
a super good source of like a Japanese (67:37 - 67:43)
person who's actually collected that in (67:41 - 67:47)
one place so um you know a lot of work (67:43 - 67:49)
to be done sure there's tons of hardcore (67:47 - 67:51)
Japanese Pokemon fans at every magazine (67:49 - 67:54)
sitting in a closet yeah you have to (67:51 - 67:57)
find those people right so like just (67:54 - 68:01)
this past week there was a similar thing (67:57 - 68:04)
why I was bumping around on Bulba PD and (68:01 - 68:06)
I found like a (68:04 - 68:08)
or they they cited a source but there (68:06 - 68:11)
was no you know I wouldn't hold up in a (68:08 - 68:13)
college-level essay it was just said (68:11 - 68:15)
like well this this says this in this (68:13 - 68:17)
book but there's no page number there's (68:15 - 68:19)
no translation there's no direct quote (68:17 - 68:21)
it just said like this is mentioned in (68:19 - 68:24)
this book it was the the book was an (68:21 - 68:27)
autobiography of and I gonna try and say (68:24 - 68:29)
her name but she's the host of Pokemon (68:27 - 68:31)
Sunday and she's a voice actress who (68:29 - 68:34)
does spiky you're Pikachu Shoko (68:31 - 68:37)
something anyway in autobiography it (68:34 - 68:39)
says as some I'm gonna tweet about (68:37 - 68:40)
tomorrow (68:39 - 68:42)
it says that spiky eared Pikachu was (68:40 - 68:44)
originally supposed to be white Pikachu (68:42 - 68:47)
and that they were they were planning on (68:44 - 68:53)
releasing like white Pichu branded white (68:47 - 69:03)
cream soup because fry so the Japanese (68:53 - 69:07)
the words for for spikey gear there for (69:03 - 69:09)
white peach you and white cream soup are (69:07 - 69:10)
almost identical there's like one letter (69:09 - 69:13)
difference and so like oh if we're gonna (69:10 - 69:14)
make white Pikachu we can just start (69:13 - 69:16)
selling white soup but white Pichu on it (69:14 - 69:19)
but they ended up it's kind of (69:16 - 69:20)
complicated (69:19 - 69:22)
they ended up scrapping that idea and (69:20 - 69:24)
going for spikey your Pichu and that was (69:22 - 69:28)
based off of this the girl who does the (69:24 - 69:30)
one of the voice actors is always making (69:28 - 69:34)
typos and basically one of the typos (69:30 - 69:37)
that she was always making the word is (69:34 - 69:39)
originally he's big but she made a type (69:37 - 69:41)
of typo which translates to like spiky (69:39 - 69:43)
or spiky eared something to that effect (69:41 - 69:45)
and so they said oh she's always making (69:43 - 69:47)
this type but let's use that typo spiky (69:45 - 69:49)
spiky ear peak okay let's do spiky or (69:47 - 69:51)
Pichu yeah let's do that there's (69:49 - 69:53)
actually concept art I've got photos of (69:51 - 69:56)
her the the girl the type of girl with (69:53 - 70:00)
official concept art of ye Picchu and (69:56 - 70:03)
I've when I got that book on Japanese (70:00 - 70:06)
Amazon with the help of a guy named (70:03 - 70:09)
Webster shout out to him and had it (70:06 - 70:11)
translated by another friend of mine no (70:09 - 70:13)
gasps whose backpack I'm not sure if (70:11 - 70:14)
you're familiar with him I've heard of (70:13 - 70:16)
that item but he had been helped me on (70:14 - 70:19)
some translation stuff recently finding (70:16 - 70:21)
but he's books that kind of thing he's (70:19 - 70:24)
great but um anyway so I actually had to (70:21 - 70:27)
get the Japanese book have it translated (70:24 - 70:29)
someone else had a picture of that (70:27 - 70:31)
concept art that they'd sent me and kind (70:29 - 70:33)
of was able to put this whole story (70:31 - 70:35)
together about how originally they had (70:33 - 70:37)
white Picchu playing for Gen 4 and not (70:35 - 70:39)
to mention the the cream soup (70:37 - 70:41)
merchandising but they ended up throwing (70:39 - 70:44)
that idea in the trash this is a this is (70:41 - 70:46)
a dumb question but regards to this (70:44 - 70:48)
translation so even even in you know (70:46 - 70:53)
2019 when Masuda and some other members (70:48 - 70:56)
of game freak's sat on stage at e3 and (70:53 - 70:58)
you know they they said what they needed (70:56 - 70:59)
to say about you know not all Pokemon (70:58 - 71:02)
coming into a sword and shield you had (70:59 - 71:03)
all these people on the internet saying (71:02 - 71:05)
like oh they must have missed translated (71:03 - 71:06)
it wrong or maybe we just didn't (71:05 - 71:09)
understand and then you know fast (71:06 - 71:11)
forward a couple months with the Game (71:09 - 71:14)
Informer interview where the Game (71:11 - 71:15)
Informer said there was you know I think (71:14 - 71:17)
what 18 gems and then they're like no (71:15 - 71:20)
that was a mistranslation cancel the (71:17 - 71:21)
only eight Tim's only eight gems only (71:20 - 71:24)
eight gems do you do you worry that in (71:21 - 71:26)
your end with the you know people you (71:24 - 71:27)
pay for translation that you know (71:26 - 71:29)
something might not be actually a (71:27 - 71:30)
hundred percent maybe they got one or (71:29 - 71:32)
two words wrong or misinterpreted (71:30 - 71:33)
something I've gone through a few (71:32 - 71:35)
translators there's a few people I'd use (71:33 - 71:37)
that they I'd have had to throw out (71:35 - 71:39)
their translations because it just (71:37 - 71:42)
wasn't up to snuff the people I've been (71:39 - 71:43)
using more recently I'm feel pretty (71:42 - 71:44)
confident about and I always (71:43 - 71:48)
double-check key phrases the most (71:44 - 71:50)
important parts really with other (71:48 - 71:52)
translators to make sure that you know (71:50 - 71:57)
if Ken Sugimori said that you know at (71:52 - 71:59)
the Hydra gun family were originally (71:57 - 72:02)
supposed to be tanks and that the purple (71:59 - 72:04)
tread marks on their bellies and their (72:02 - 72:06)
final designs are leftovers from the (72:04 - 72:08)
tanks you know that's pretty important (72:06 - 72:09)
information to make sure it's it's right (72:08 - 72:11)
and so when I get that in from the (72:09 - 72:13)
translator I'll make sure and (72:11 - 72:14)
double-check that because that's (72:13 - 72:17)
particularly important and you know if (72:14 - 72:19)
necessary all you know make any (72:17 - 72:21)
adjustments to the translation and check (72:19 - 72:22)
that back with the original translators (72:21 - 72:23)
there's a lot of back-and-forth that (72:22 - 72:26)
goes on with these translations but (72:23 - 72:27)
fortunately the the translator I'll be (72:26 - 72:29)
using more recently is really good and (72:27 - 72:33)
also a Pokemon fan herself so that helps (72:29 - 72:36)
a lot because I've learned that in the (72:33 - 72:37)
past with you if you have a good (72:36 - 72:38)
translator if they don't know what (72:37 - 72:42)
pokemon is then then there's gonna be (72:38 - 72:45)
some some you know errors just cuz they (72:42 - 72:46)
don't know what a trainer is I don't (72:45 - 72:48)
know what a Pikachu is I don't know what (72:46 - 72:50)
leveling up is and you know so forth so (72:48 - 72:52)
that makes sense can we bring up (72:50 - 72:54)
something that was a little bit (72:52 - 72:57)
controversial here and bubble pedia has (72:54 - 72:59)
since corrected (72:57 - 73:02)
forgive me I'm so bad at saying Japanese (72:59 - 73:04)
names you're you know exactly we're (73:02 - 73:06)
going to go with this mmm (73:04 - 73:08)
say out oh I would mispronounce it (73:06 - 73:10)
monster I would say moon ao Saito (73:08 - 73:13)
okay but it's probably wrong to who's (73:10 - 73:15)
the male versus female thing yeah so not (73:13 - 73:17)
only was it a male versus female thing (73:15 - 73:20)
but I don't know what happened you know (73:17 - 73:24)
somewhere in the last 20-some years (73:20 - 73:27)
where people think that a saber-tooth (73:24 - 73:29)
Tiger is a dog and so the other two are (73:27 - 73:32)
also a dog Ken Sugimori I think on (73:29 - 73:35)
Twitter who then asked the creator of n (73:32 - 73:37)
tastes weakened and raikou you know what (73:35 - 73:39)
their thought process was and they they (73:37 - 73:41)
tweeted about it and I saw this over a (73:39 - 73:43)
year ago I think it was a reddit thread (73:41 - 73:46)
that you know somebody took all the big (73:43 - 73:48)
screen shot at all the conversation put (73:46 - 73:50)
it in a giant image and you recently (73:48 - 73:53)
just tweeted about it and for whatever (73:50 - 73:55)
reason Bulma pedia said she instead of (73:53 - 73:57)
he it was kind of like a lot to unwrap (73:55 - 74:00)
here one that Bobo pedia said she for (73:57 - 74:04)
several years and to that you know even (74:00 - 74:07)
after you tell fans that you know they (74:04 - 74:09)
said for the most part that you know (74:07 - 74:11)
they're based off a lion and a tiger and (74:09 - 74:13)
stuff that people still are like well (74:11 - 74:16)
I'm calling them dogs right very weird (74:13 - 74:19)
it was pretty weird yeah yeah someone (74:16 - 74:21)
had sent me that reddit reddit thread (74:19 - 74:24)
that was like a copy-paste and (74:21 - 74:27)
translation of a Twitter conversation (74:24 - 74:29)
they're making like five social medias (74:27 - 74:29)
all mixed up (74:29 - 74:31)
yeah I've seen that conversation between (74:29 - 74:36)
Sugimori and Saito I'd originally was (74:31 - 74:38)
talking to I referred to side 2 as a (74:36 - 74:40)
girl and some people said now it's a he (74:38 - 74:42)
then I started saying oh (74:40 - 74:45)
Thomas oh no he like mousey but hey at (74:42 - 74:48)
this point I've got my week last week (74:45 - 74:50)
when I like when your tweet last week (74:48 - 74:52)
with the week before I was like well (74:50 - 74:53)
they have always known it as a girl and (74:52 - 74:56)
they're saying he is it then I started (74:53 - 74:57)
saying he and then people are like not (74:56 - 74:59)
to she cuz it's on both PD and I was (74:57 - 75:02)
like I feel like I feel like lava (74:59 - 75:04)
probably did more research than I do (75:02 - 75:07)
Wow so as other people told me cuz you (75:04 - 75:09)
know there's there's several gamefreak (75:07 - 75:11)
developers who are really hard to find (75:09 - 75:13)
pictures or even any information about (75:11 - 75:14)
them there's several that just don't (75:13 - 75:16)
have it's dumb there's none on Google (75:14 - 75:19)
Images they're not anywhere someone did (75:16 - 75:21)
end up the Japanese person did end up (75:19 - 75:24)
sending me pictures of manao site oh and (75:21 - 75:27)
it is definitely dude and there's some (75:24 - 75:28)
other stuff like in some game free (75:27 - 75:32)
documents they list all their the staff (75:28 - 75:33)
who worked on this particular project (75:32 - 75:35)
they listed them all as male or female (75:33 - 75:38)
and Saito's listed as a male so it's (75:35 - 75:39)
definitely dude say that with confidence (75:38 - 75:42)
now but because it says I'm bald VPD is (75:39 - 75:44)
she anytime they have up station or she (75:42 - 75:48)
oh they have okay as a February 12th it (75:44 - 75:50)
says he has worked for Game Freak so I'm (75:48 - 75:54)
not sure when that happened but I guess (75:50 - 75:56)
I guess somebody somebody probably saw (75:54 - 75:57)
that conversation for me recently (75:56 - 75:59)
because when you tweeted that which (75:57 - 76:00)
again was like maybe a week or two ago (75:59 - 76:03)
of this conversation it still said she I (76:00 - 76:05)
think it was probably there's a bull the (76:03 - 76:07)
PD moderator who's an absolute rockstar (76:05 - 76:11)
is he's he's he knows a lot of time I'll (76:07 - 76:13)
have a question I'll go him he just has (76:11 - 76:16)
all these weird Japanese books and maps (76:13 - 76:18)
and all kinds of stuff that I didn't (76:16 - 76:20)
even know existed and I'll have a (76:18 - 76:22)
question he'll have like a pile of (76:20 - 76:23)
documents will go through just to (76:22 - 76:25)
confirm whether this map should be (76:23 - 76:27)
considered canon or not but anyway (76:25 - 76:29)
there's Snorlax Monster is a bubble (76:27 - 76:31)
pedia moderator that I'm yes ends with (76:29 - 76:32)
and we've had him on the show before (76:31 - 76:35)
he's great oh oh yeah he's great and (76:32 - 76:37)
he's probably the one who updated that (76:35 - 76:39)
he's yeah he's really good but you're (76:37 - 76:41)
you're gonna keep on I guess reporting (76:39 - 76:44)
on old Pokemon stuff for the time being (76:41 - 76:46)
I see I don't I don't think you're gonna (76:44 - 76:48)

stage it goes (78:18 - 78:25)
[Music] (78:20 - 78:30)
do do do do do do do you recognize it (78:25 - 78:33)
that's all it is the intro to my new (78:30 - 78:37)
podcast kata Mari gasps : (78:33 - 78:40)
let's roll up together (78:37 - 78:40)
walk across this show this show we are (78:45 - 79:01)
back Pokemon home sensation of the week (78:52 - 79:04)
some issues that we talked about last (79:01 - 79:06)
week there were some good things we (79:04 - 79:08)
talked about last week they have updated (79:06 - 79:11)
the app three times since we last talked (79:08 - 79:14)
if you are on iOS they updated it four (79:11 - 79:16)
times if you're on Android because the (79:14 - 79:18)
last update (79:16 - 79:22)
1.0.8 is specifically only for Android I (79:18 - 79:24)
believe it had to do with like 32-bit (79:22 - 79:31)
devices I think so iOS never got 1.0.8 (79:24 - 79:34)
I'm assuming they updated again both (79:31 - 79:37)
versions will go to one point zero point (79:34 - 79:41)
nine has your opinions on home changed (79:37 - 79:44)
at all since the updates and since it's (79:41 - 79:46)
now been more than a week since the (79:44 - 79:48)
service has come out (79:46 - 79:52)
I mean my opinion the updates have not (79:48 - 79:55)
had any influence on my opinion um I did (79:52 - 79:58)
upload so I'm being very cautious (79:55 - 80:02)
because I just want to control my (79:58 - 80:05)
Pokemon experience pretty strongly and (80:02 - 80:07)
what I don't want to happen because I (80:05 - 80:11)
just recall with Pokemon bank with ultra (80:07 - 80:12)
Sun and ultra moon was you could (80:11 - 80:14)
synchronize your Pokemon bank with those (80:12 - 80:16)
games and then it would say oh you've (80:14 - 80:17)
already completed the national dex (80:16 - 80:19)
because you have it all up in bank and (80:17 - 80:21)
like I don't want that to accidentally (80:19 - 80:24)
happen with Pokemon sword because right (80:21 - 80:28)
now I am going through and building a (80:24 - 80:30)
living Dex in Pokemon sword because (80:28 - 80:33)
that's actually fun for me to do and I'm (80:30 - 80:35)
having a lot of fun doing that (80:33 - 80:39)
so I uploaded my current living Dex (80:35 - 80:43)
which is up through Mel metal into (80:39 - 80:48)
Pokemon home it actually I mean it's (80:43 - 80:54)
gone okay the boxes there's like on the (80:48 - 80:57)
mobile phone it's odd but it's not the (80:54 - 81:02)
end of the world just like they they (80:57 - 81:05)
have the for some reason they have like (81:02 - 81:08)
a list of bank or not they have like (81:05 - 81:11)
home boxes and now I just had it open in (81:08 - 81:12)
front of me and I Chloe you're talking (81:11 - 81:14)
about the labels is they label your home (81:12 - 81:17)
boxes or your label they label the boxes (81:14 - 81:19)
that come from banks so you can find (81:17 - 81:22)
them easier when you deposit them yeah (81:19 - 81:25)
so I have like bank 1 through 27 (81:22 - 81:28)
although there I mean yeah bank 1 (81:25 - 81:30)
through 27 but they're in descending (81:28 - 81:30)
order (81:30 - 81:34)
for for whatever reason and then I have (81:30 - 81:39)
like home 1 through infinity and on a (81:34 - 81:42)
twitch for some reason like even though (81:39 - 81:45)
I uploaded the Pokemon into Pokemon home (81:42 - 81:49)
in a very orderly fashion they're not in (81:45 - 81:52)
any order in (81:49 - 81:56)
the home so home defaults because it's (81:52 - 81:59)
like go it defaults to like the default (81:56 - 82:01)
view is the last 30 that you deposited (81:59 - 82:04)
yeah whatever reason guess that makes (82:01 - 82:06)
sense because if you just deposited you (82:04 - 82:07)
probably want to know where they want (82:06 - 82:11)
maybe well so now like my box like if (82:07 - 82:13)
I'm on my phone which I am and I go into (82:11 - 82:15)
box home one (82:13 - 82:19)
right okay so that's that's organized (82:15 - 82:23)
right okay so it's Bulbasaur Ivysaur (82:19 - 82:26)
Venus or Charmander Charmeleon Charizard (82:23 - 82:30)
that's it's all good but I know but (82:26 - 82:34)
where's Mel tan and Mel metal well they (82:30 - 82:38)
do have I mean Mel Mel tan is 808 Mel (82:34 - 82:41)
metal is eight or nine but they're not (82:38 - 82:43)
they're not there (82:41 - 82:45)
uh it's (82:43 - 82:47)
they're not in order anymore even though (82:45 - 82:50)
when I look at the other ones they are (82:47 - 82:52)
in order I just so I didn't realize this (82:50 - 82:54)
from last week Greg I don't know if this (82:52 - 82:57)
answers your question but okay so I have (82:54 - 82:58)
a minor complaint here I'm sure they can (82:57 - 83:00)
fix this but it really bothers me that I (82:58 - 83:04)
can't reorder my labels mm-hmm (83:00 - 83:05)
because I have like so I have live (83:04 - 83:08)
labels for like 2012 event 2013 event (83:05 - 83:11)
2018 event dozen 15 event they're in the (83:08 - 83:13)
wrong order and then I have different (83:11 - 83:15)
labels for like so a lot of those events (83:13 - 83:17)
are mythical but I also have a label for (83:15 - 83:20)
all my mythical x' which apparently have (83:17 - 83:22)
74 of that I can just find so I can look (83:20 - 83:23)
at all my mythical x' at once by (83:22 - 83:25)
clicking the mythical label or if I want (83:23 - 83:27)
to look at like these are the Pokemon I (83:25 - 83:29)
specifically got during 2016 events I (83:27 - 83:32)
can click on that but then under all the (83:29 - 83:34)
labels it does show the boxes so my (83:32 - 83:38)
first box is 0 0 1 2 0 3 0 and then 0 3 (83:34 - 83:41)
1 2 0 60 so it does show you all the (83:38 - 83:45)
boxes that you have and then eventually (83:41 - 83:47)
gets to like home 10 home 11 home 12 (83:45 - 83:49)
because I haven't renamed those boxes so (83:47 - 83:51)
does that not solve the issue you're (83:49 - 83:54)
looking for because I can click on 0 0 1 (83:51 - 83:56)
2 0 3 0 and now I can see that box of (83:54 - 83:59)
those 30 Pokemon yeah they're in pokedex (83:56 - 84:02)
gravity so let me say something really (83:59 - 84:04)
nice about look at my house like one (84:02 - 84:06)
thing that they did that (84:04 - 84:10)
no Pokemon game as far as I know has (84:06 - 84:12)
done before and it's something that I've (84:10 - 84:14)
wanted for a very long time (84:12 - 84:18)
if the Pokemon is shiny when I'm looking (84:14 - 84:20)
at it in the box for you I see the shiny (84:18 - 84:23)
oh yeah tellers yes that is very nice (84:20 - 84:26)
which well when you said how my game has (84:23 - 84:31)
ever done Pokemon go says hi okay I I (84:26 - 84:36)
mean who's gonna say I came oh c'mon I (84:31 - 84:41)
care about but let's not be so harsh to (84:36 - 84:44)
answer your question like it has my (84:41 - 84:45)
experience gotten better (84:44 - 84:47)
was that your question I guess that was (84:45 - 84:50)
the original question yeah no okay I (84:47 - 84:53)
mean I do like the graphics for the (84:50 - 84:55)
Pokemon to like the the drawings that (84:53 - 84:59)
they've made yeah the art yeah the (84:55 - 85:02)
problems that exist before still exist (84:59 - 85:04)
there's still some questions about like (85:02 - 85:07)
like why is my date countered when the (85:04 - 85:09)
challenges not counting up like there's (85:07 - 85:10)

Japanese form butterfly and you send me (85:39 - 85:47)

Venusaur from level 1 to 10 that that (86:15 - 86:22)
can't exist tell it to say no boiler it (86:18 - 86:25)
can technically (86:22 - 86:29)
because of Pokemon go you can have like (86:25 - 86:33)
a level 5 Charizard but we can't access (86:29 - 86:36)
it yet right clan let's go Pikachu let's (86:33 - 86:38)
go Eevee so if somebody caught a wild (86:36 - 86:42)
level 5 Charizard they can move it (86:38 - 86:43)
through let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee (86:42 - 86:46)
into Pokemon home I didn't think about (86:43 - 86:48)
that until somebody brought it up (86:46 - 86:51)
yeah but like Gen 5 isn't in there oh (86:48 - 86:53)
yes sir like you can't be like a problem (86:51 - 86:55)
if if suddenly something becomes (86:53 - 86:57)
available and they say hey we're gonna (86:55 - 86:58)
click check this out and check it off (86:57 - 87:01)
great khali people are asking for level (86:58 - 87:03)
1 to 10 b vm they don't exist they can't (87:01 - 87:05)
exist it doesn't have off to level 12 (87:03 - 87:10)
yes and for your own server space and (87:05 - 87:12)
for people trying to search anything (87:10 - 87:15)
just say those things aren't possible (87:12 - 87:18)
because you had put up a Ditto right i (87:15 - 87:23)
put up a did a level 40 56 did oh that i (87:18 - 87:26)
caught in cerulean cave and let's go p - (87:23 - 87:27)
lets go i put up a Ditto and i asked for (87:26 - 87:31)
a vivre Leone and I have one I got a (87:27 - 87:32)
bunch of Japanese ones because people (87:31 - 87:34)
are trading me the exact same ones over (87:32 - 87:36)
and over and over again do you think I (87:34 - 87:39)
could find your ditto amongst all the (87:36 - 87:41)
people asking for things that are not (87:39 - 87:43)
possible no one could buy my dunno I (87:41 - 87:48)
searched by every option and because it (87:43 - 87:51)
fills up so fast with a lot of stuff (87:48 - 87:55)
that can't happen like I I went through (87:51 - 87:57)
this is how I went to try to frame you I (87:55 - 88:00)
did level range game it came from and I (87:57 - 88:02)
couldn't find it (88:00 - 88:03)
because you can select those as (88:02 - 88:06)
filtering options and it wasn't there (88:03 - 88:08)
but everybody else asking for things (88:06 - 88:11)
that didn't exist sure were it's just a (88:08 - 88:14)
very frustrating that well I think the (88:11 - 88:15)
more frustrating thing that we talked (88:14 - 88:19)
about last week was that it was hey I'm (88:15 - 88:24)
looking for a zero aura but I'm only (88:19 - 88:28)
offering a Weedle right and they fixed (88:24 - 88:30)
that that was actually one of the the (88:28 - 88:32)
first things that they fixed after the (88:30 - 88:34)
podcast obviously because they listened (88:32 - 88:36)
to the podcast obviously but you can't (88:34 - 88:40)
trade mythical Pokemon anymore and you (88:36 - 88:42)
could never trade mythical Pokemon which (88:40 - 88:45)
we talked about last week the reason (88:42 - 88:47)
that mythical Pokemon you can always (88:45 - 88:50)
trade a mythical Pokemon to somebody in (88:47 - 88:52)
the same room as you locally through a (88:50 - 88:57)
link cable or through a IR or through (88:52 - 89:00)
Wi-Fi or whatever when Greg was here (88:57 - 89:04)
like a year ago I traded him a meloetta (89:00 - 89:06)
that I got from the World Championship (89:04 - 89:09)
and you traded me I think (89:06 - 89:11)
Victini or something I was missing yeah (89:09 - 89:13)
something I was missing but we traded (89:11 - 89:16)
mythical Pokemon that works on the GTS (89:13 - 89:19)
mythical Pokemon have ribbons that (89:16 - 89:22)
prevent them from being traded ideally (89:19 - 89:23)
the cherish ball also you're not (89:22 - 89:24)
supposed to be able to trade cherish (89:23 - 89:26)
ball Pokemon through the GTS but it's (89:24 - 89:28)
the ribbon itself that prevents the (89:26 - 89:30)
trade it's usually like celebratory (89:28 - 89:34)
ribbon or ribbed like ribbon of event (89:30 - 89:38)
the in X&Y and Sun and Moon the GTS were (89:34 - 89:40)
was had a bunch of mythical Pokemon that (89:38 - 89:42)
you could trade but they were all hacked (89:40 - 89:44)
or pique hexed because they were missing (89:42 - 89:47)
the ribbon so when you when those people (89:44 - 89:49)
created the Pokemon from scratch in (89:47 - 89:51)
their third party program they just (89:49 - 89:53)
didn't include the ribbon which allowed (89:51 - 89:55)
it to be traded so it's like one way to (89:53 - 89:59)
tell if your Pokemon was authentic is is (89:55 - 90:01)
that the correct OT is the correct ID (89:59 - 90:04)
numbers does it even have the ribbon if (90:01 - 90:06)
you can just say no to all of those (90:04 - 90:08)
because if you got it wonder traded to (90:06 - 90:11)
you it wouldn't it had to not have the (90:08 - 90:14)
ribbon to arrive to you so they pretty (90:11 - 90:17)
much turned off all mythical stuff yeah (90:14 - 90:19)
in the NBA it can't be traded but you (90:17 - 90:22)
can still request that to be sent to you (90:19 - 90:25)
yeah but let those let those people (90:22 - 90:29)
waste their threw you across but it but (90:25 - 90:31)
it Gunks up the search right sure does (90:29 - 90:35)
it it just Gunks up the works well it (90:31 - 90:37)
ruins the user experience is what it is (90:35 - 90:41)
yeah and so it's just like if if (90:37 - 90:43)
mythical can't be accepted through (90:41 - 90:47)
traded through the GTS or Wonder donut (90:43 - 90:49)
or Wonder I don't have that's a (90:47 - 90:51)
selectable option just get rid of it (90:49 - 90:54)
just get rid of it (90:51 - 90:56)
legendaries are so broken for some (90:54 - 90:58)
reason if you toggle don't search by (90:56 - 91:01)
legendaries type null and the tapas are (90:58 - 91:02)
still showing even if you have that on (91:01 - 91:05)
and off so that's still broken as of (91:02 - 91:06)
this podcast yep (91:05 - 91:08)
mythical z' can no longer be room traded (91:06 - 91:11)
wait that was part of the other thing so (91:08 - 91:15)
again i don't they they're there needs (91:11 - 91:18)
to be like what pokemon go did wear knee (91:15 - 91:21)
antic was like okay you can trade one (91:18 - 91:23)
legendary a day you gotta be local (91:21 - 91:26)
you're not allowed to trade mythical x' (91:23 - 91:28)
you can trade like there needs to be (91:26 - 91:31)
some almost like a checklist of like (91:28 - 91:33)
what is allowed and what is not allowed (91:31 - 91:35)
because now we have multiple ways (91:33 - 91:38)
between pokemon go sword and shield sun (91:35 - 91:41)
and moon wonder trade room trade (91:38 - 91:44)
surprise trade GTS what can be traded (91:41 - 91:48)
where we need a list if they came out (91:44 - 91:49)
and they were like hey this is what (91:48 - 91:50)
we're doing (91:49 - 91:52)
mythical x' can only be traded when (91:50 - 91:53)
you're standing next to a person i'm (91:52 - 91:55)
sure like that would be probably (91:53 - 91:57)
upsetting to a lot of people but at (91:55 - 92:00)
least we know and if they were like hey (91:57 - 92:01)
legendaries can be traded with friends (92:00 - 92:04)
whether that is through the GTS or (92:01 - 92:07)
through wonder trade or through whatever (92:04 - 92:10)
cool but you're only allowed one a day (92:07 - 92:13)
and if you have 800 trubbish trade to (92:10 - 92:15)
your heart's content on everything in (92:13 - 92:19)
the world but we but like that's the (92:15 - 92:22)
frustrating part right now for people is (92:19 - 92:23)
they want to get the maguey erna of (92:22 - 92:27)
different color so like I'm sure they (92:23 - 92:30)
will I'm sure they will release more (92:27 - 92:33)
mythical Pokemon as we go well if I was (92:30 - 92:36)
missing Victini I don't have a way to (92:33 - 92:37)
put bikini into sword and shield to (92:36 - 92:38)
trade a friend (92:37 - 92:41)
yep so the only way I can trade Victini (92:38 - 92:44)
is by standing next to a friend and I (92:41 - 92:47)
can trade them a Victini they can then (92:44 - 92:48)
register it in their national decks they (92:47 - 92:51)
can then apply to get this the Miggy R (92:48 - 92:52)
now which hopefully it was still not (92:51 - 92:54)
fully fixed but they get the Miggy (92:52 - 92:56)
Renault for having complete decks then (92:54 - 92:58)
they trade me the Victini back (92:56 - 93:02)
and we're good and I I personally don't (92:58 - 93:03)
have a problem with that because like at (93:02 - 93:05)
the end of the day that's what Pokemon (93:03 - 93:07)
go kind or Pokemon was always is like (93:05 - 93:10)
gotta talk to you got to make friends (93:07 - 93:13)
and trade oh and he does that anymore (93:10 - 93:16)
yeah but if they really want to keep my (93:13 - 93:18)
mythical Pokemon special Greg I saw you (93:16 - 93:21)
trade 20 Pokemon with somebody just this (93:18 - 93:22)
Thursday night and that somebody was a (93:21 - 93:24)
friend of yours so don't say yeah he (93:22 - 93:25)
does that anymore (93:24 - 93:29)
I made that friend before making that (93:25 - 93:31)
trade I didn't make that friend while (93:29 - 93:33)
making those yeah okay look if I met (93:31 - 93:35)
some random person and they were like (93:33 - 93:36)
hey can I borrow your Victini I'd be (93:35 - 93:41)
like maybe not but if it was a genuine (93:36 - 93:43)
friend and that they were missing like (93:41 - 93:45)
three mythical Pokemon and we met each (93:43 - 93:48)
other at PAX like finally hey we've (93:45 - 93:50)
known each other for two years I know (93:48 - 93:52)
you're only missing Sara aura and (93:50 - 93:54)
Victini let me trade these V's real (93:52 - 93:55)
quick cool you got Mihrimah gearing I (93:54 - 93:57)
think's for those back I'm so happy I (93:55 - 93:59)
was able to help you like that's it that (93:57 - 94:01)
is a situation I want to happen and it (93:59 - 94:04)
can happen but there's still there's (94:01 - 94:06)
this vagueness of like Game Freak what (94:04 - 94:09)
would you like us players to do like (94:06 - 94:13)
give like list out what you what your (94:09 - 94:15)
overview of this service should be (94:13 - 94:18)
because now people are like what how are (94:15 - 94:19)
we supposed to trade these things do you (94:18 - 94:20)
if you want us to trade them in person (94:19 - 94:23)
and you want these to be special just (94:20 - 94:25)
save that just come out and say like hey (94:23 - 94:28)
this is our this is our goal going (94:25 - 94:30)
forward here are the expectations we are (94:28 - 94:33)
setting and if you put an exclamation (94:30 - 94:35)
point saying I've completed a challenge (94:33 - 94:37)
but when I go in the challenges you (94:35 - 94:39)
haven't put an exclamation point on the (94:37 - 94:41)
one that I've completed I still don't (94:39 - 94:43)
know what I just did I think that has I (94:41 - 94:46)
think the challenges and the news that (94:43 - 94:48)
is the thing that's broken because I've (94:46 - 94:50)
noticed people who can't get my gear nah (94:48 - 94:52)
even if they have a complete national (94:50 - 94:54)
dex they also their challenges say (94:52 - 94:55)
they've only checked the app on day one (94:54 - 94:58)
so those to me those two problems seem (94:55 - 95:00)
to be together the challenges and the (94:58 - 95:04)
maguey erna seem to be the the current (95:00 - 95:08)
most broken thing yeah like I don't I've (95:04 - 95:11)
literally used Pokemon home everyday (95:08 - 95:13)
because I've been trying to get my video (95:11 - 95:18)
index forms which again guess what kids (95:13 - 95:20)
it just got the same form for a same (95:18 - 95:27)
form it's maddening to me but like it (95:20 - 95:29)
doesn't move forward and I have I've had (95:27 - 95:31)
a people who are like oh I'll just (95:29 - 95:32)
borrow your zero or I'll give it right (95:31 - 95:34)
back and I'm like I don't want to give (95:32 - 95:37)
it to you and did not work have to have (95:34 - 95:39)
it not work or you have to hold onto it (95:37 - 95:41)
for a month until this gets fixed I'm (95:39 - 95:44)
not gonna give anything that I only have (95:41 - 95:48)
one copy of until I know this is fixed (95:44 - 95:51)
until this is actually going to reward (95:48 - 95:55)
you with the thing that you want and I (95:51 - 95:57)
don't like and it could be my gate like (95:55 - 96:00)
I'm stuck a lot of mine things are stuck (95:57 - 96:02)
on day one like but a lot of them aren't (96:00 - 96:05)
like I just did another twenty one two (96:02 - 96:07)
trades and that when to trade count went (96:05 - 96:11)
up but my days have it it's so like I (96:07 - 96:13)
get that there's bugs and there's always (96:11 - 96:15)
gonna be bug problems but I would just (96:13 - 96:19)
like to know or functionality the (96:15 - 96:21)
function I would just like to know (96:19 - 96:24)
before like is it a bug on my end should (96:21 - 96:25)
I be submitting a bug report is this a (96:24 - 96:28)
well known issue is this you know it's (96:25 - 96:32)
not been a long time which is fine but (96:28 - 96:35)
like I can't give a hundred percent (96:32 - 96:38)
thumbs up on it when I'm still feeling (96:35 - 96:39)
really uneasy with a lot of the core (96:38 - 96:42)
function yeah and I use it a lot like (96:39 - 96:46)
people are like upset or whatever that I (96:42 - 96:48)
meant not having an ideal time with home (96:46 - 96:50)
it hasn't stopped me from using it it (96:48 - 96:51)
didn't stop me from paying for it so (96:50 - 96:54)
they've got my money I just wished that (96:51 - 96:58)
I had more faith in it like sitting in (96:54 - 96:59)
your stream and doing a twenty room (96:58 - 97:03)
trade was fun yeah I really like room (96:59 - 97:05)
trade I think it's cool but until (97:03 - 97:07)
something fun and they're like I got (97:05 - 97:10)
more hacked oh I got more shiny house (97:07 - 97:12)
where that is and it's like okay dude no (97:10 - 97:14)
you don't yeah well you know control (97:12 - 97:18)
over it and it's fun it's fun because I (97:14 - 97:20)
know somebody who's doing that for (97:18 - 97:23)
entertainment is enough like if I was (97:20 - 97:25)
sitting at GenCon I'm not jumping in (97:23 - 97:28)
a bunch of randos room trait screen to (97:25 - 97:30)
be like let's zip it zip let's send (97:28 - 97:32)
whatever like it's a weird function (97:30 - 97:35)
that's fun in a very specific use case (97:32 - 97:37)
like and I sat out there and gave out a (97:35 - 97:39)
bunch of my hidden ability Rosalia's and (97:37 - 97:42)
then you know when I got they'll Litton (97:39 - 97:44)
from you I backed out and then when you (97:42 - 97:46)
do it again I run in and give away a few (97:44 - 97:48)
more like it's fun to send those things (97:46 - 97:50)
out but it's like not a thrilling (97:48 - 97:52)
function it is definitely well because (97:50 - 97:54)
the timer's on the room trade are so (97:52 - 97:57)
high it's like definitely so long well (97:54 - 97:59)
we got about six minutes before this (97:57 - 98:02)
Pokemon even starts to be traded so what (97:59 - 98:03)
would you count on it (98:02 - 98:06)
is there no way to say hey it's full (98:03 - 98:08)
skip to the neck now so there's two (98:06 - 98:11)
countdowns the first countdown is like (98:08 - 98:13)
it's what like 200 seconds or whatever (98:11 - 98:16)
it is the rear pointing out of the room (98:13 - 98:18)
and then that doesn't you don't that (98:16 - 98:21)
timer doesn't start until the host picks (98:18 - 98:23)
their Pokemon and once the host picks (98:21 - 98:26)
their Pokemon the room closes and then (98:23 - 98:28)
everyone else has then a new timer (98:26 - 98:30)
starts of 200 seconds which is everyone (98:28 - 98:33)
else picking their Pokemon but once (98:30 - 98:36)
everyone picks their Pokemon the timer (98:33 - 98:39)
still goes which I can kind of see is (98:36 - 98:42)
understandable because like if you were (98:39 - 98:43)
the last person to pick and then you (98:42 - 98:45)
selected the wrong Pokemon you don't (98:43 - 98:47)
want to be locked into that but there (98:45 - 98:49)
almost needs to be like once everyone (98:47 - 98:52)
picks now we've dropped the timer to 10 (98:49 - 98:55)
seconds and that gives any people an (98:52 - 98:57)
option to be like oh let me Reese elect (98:55 - 99:01)
which then extends the length because (98:57 - 99:04)
there was lots of times where everyone (99:01 - 99:05)
picked and we were still waiting in like (99:04 - 99:09)
85 seconds I mean like 3 minutes is a (99:05 - 99:12)
long time yeah where do you like the (99:09 - 99:13)
raid battles where it's like once (99:12 - 99:17)
everybody says I'm good then it goes Oh (99:13 - 99:20)
in life sword and shield yeah yeah yeah (99:17 - 99:23)
like the timers are just really long I I (99:20 - 99:26)
was thinking because what are the rate (99:23 - 99:28)
timers in Pokemon go they're only like (99:26 - 99:31)
well it depends I think five stars have (99:28 - 99:34)
longer timers than like 1 2 stars (99:31 - 99:37)
I think and even then I'm like okay come (99:34 - 99:40)
on nobody mores coming let's go it's (99:37 - 99:42)
full there's twenty if you're listening (99:40 - 99:43)
and you're having some errors this is (99:42 - 99:46)
off support pokemon.com so if you're (99:43 - 99:49)
having error eight eight zero seven this (99:46 - 99:51)
occurs with an issue of Pokemon home (99:49 - 99:54)
save data on your device um so you have (99:51 - 99:55)
to delete the save data (99:54 - 99:57)
restart Pokemon home to resolve the (99:55 - 99:59)
issue deleting Pokemon home does not (99:57 - 100:02)
remove the Pokemon from your Pokemon (99:59 - 100:04)
home because that's on the cloud what (100:02 - 100:06)
you have to do is from the home menu (100:04 - 100:08)
select system settings scroll down to (100:06 - 100:12)
data management press a scroll down and (100:08 - 100:14)
highlight save delete save data press a (100:12 - 100:17)
if you're on the switch and you need to (100:14 - 100:18)
enter a parental controls you do that (100:17 - 100:20)
now select which game title you want to (100:18 - 100:22)
delete the save data for Pokemon home (100:20 - 100:25)
delete it it's like the user you want to (100:22 - 100:26)
delete a fourth the user that's having (100:25 - 100:29)
the issue and then delete it once you do (100:26 - 100:34)
that then redownload Pokemon home and it (100:29 - 100:35)
should fix that so that's support errors (100:34 - 100:38)
eight eight zero seven if you're on (100:35 - 100:42)
obviously the switch if you're getting (100:38 - 100:45)
error nine nine nine and these it means (100:42 - 100:47)
you just would be getting the error code (100:45 - 100:49)
right it's not like you're not seeing (100:47 - 100:50)
something happening if you're getting (100:49 - 100:51)
net specific you're getting that (100:50 - 100:52)
specific error so those are the ones (100:51 - 100:54)
that they've they've updated these like (100:52 - 100:56)
ten hours ago so these are still known (100:54 - 100:58)
errors that's why I'm bringing them up (100:56 - 101:01)
this air so the if you're getting error (100:58 - 101:03)
nine nine nine this error is caused that (101:01 - 101:05)
you have one or more Pokemon you're in (101:03 - 101:07)
creation using manipulated game data (101:05 - 101:09)
even if you've obtained this Pokemon (101:07 - 101:11)
unintentionally Pokemon created (101:09 - 101:13)
manipulated game data cannot be used in (101:11 - 101:19)
Pokemon home ok because you really so (101:13 - 101:21)
frustrating like knowing that people got (101:19 - 101:24)
hacked things the first day of wonder (101:21 - 101:27)
boxing like well I don't know they're (101:24 - 101:28)
never going to disclose what they look (101:27 - 101:31)
for at hacked Pokemon right but so many (101:28 - 101:33)
hacked Pokemon got through so if you're (101:31 - 101:36)
getting error $9.99 you probably have an (101:33 - 101:38)
obviously hacked Pokemon again I don't (101:36 - 101:41)
know if it's happened for (101:38 - 101:41)
if you have that issue so if that (101:41 - 101:45)
Pokemon has been moved to home they've (101:44 - 101:47)
somehow it made it through the Pokemon (101:45 - 101:49)
will cause the application to freeze or (101:47 - 101:51)
become unresponsive when you search for (101:49 - 101:53)
it if this happens you need to shut down (101:51 - 101:55)
and restart Pokemon home to resolve this (101:53 - 101:58)
program to resolve this problem delete (101:55 - 102:00)
any Pokemon of this kind from home by (101:58 - 102:02)
the following steps on the switch (102:00 - 102:04)
highlight the Pokemon press X press the (102:02 - 102:06)
a button to hold it up highlight release (102:04 - 102:08)
press a just this pokemon release and (102:06 - 102:10)
press a you're getting a 999 it's (102:08 - 102:13)
because of a hacked Pokemon eight eight (102:10 - 102:16)
eight is an issue with save data (102:13 - 102:20)
management those are the two most common (102:16 - 102:24)
issues according to support top Pokemon (102:20 - 102:28)
calm there was an issue that was fixed (102:24 - 102:29)
in 1.0.7 (102:28 - 102:32)
which was the face ID issue on iOS which (102:29 - 102:34)
when we talked about last week Pokemon (102:32 - 102:37)
Home has flaws and it wasn't great out (102:34 - 102:41)
the gate I had 800 people watching me on (102:37 - 102:45)
twitch when Pokemon home came out which (102:41 - 102:46)
is a very I mean in the grand scheme of (102:45 - 102:48)
things 800 people out of probably a (102:46 - 102:50)
million plus people that downloaded this (102:48 - 102:53)
game or application is very small but I (102:50 - 102:56)
not exaggerating with the amount of (102:53 - 102:57)
people that came into stream they (102:56 - 102:59)
couldn't find the app and when they (102:57 - 103:01)
didn't get the app that was greedy they (102:59 - 103:05)
couldn't log into the app and I'm and in (103:01 - 103:07)
retrospect I'm thinking like if you (103:05 - 103:10)
don't use Twitter right you don't use (103:07 - 103:13)
twitch and you know you just play (103:10 - 103:15)
pokemon and this was your first (103:13 - 103:19)
experience of like how am i I can't log (103:15 - 103:20)
into this app I can't link my Nintendo (103:19 - 103:23)
account like there was no support (103:20 - 103:26)
articles at the time you know no like (103:23 - 103:28)
even Sarah B (103:26 - 103:30)
wasn't reporting on how to fix this (103:28 - 103:32)
issue but I figured it out with my (103:30 - 103:35)
community which is if you were trying to (103:32 - 103:39)
log in via face ID it would fail and the (103:35 - 103:42)
only way to get past it was to manually (103:39 - 103:45)
type your password you couldn't copy and (103:42 - 103:46)
paste it you couldn't face ID it you (103:45 - 103:48)
just had to type it in yourself and it (103:46 - 103:51)
will work and they fixed it it's fixed (103:48 - 103:54)
now and it took him a week to fix it but (103:51 - 103:56)
if you didn't try that if you're just (103:54 - 103:59)
using face ID on iOS because it's worked (103:56 - 104:00)
for everything else and it doesn't work (103:59 - 104:03)
for this and you reset your password you (104:00 - 104:05)
did everything else none of that would (104:03 - 104:06)
have worked unless you typed your (104:05 - 104:08)
password which like I get it that's (104:06 - 104:11)
probably like hey no one tested face ID (104:08 - 104:14)
before it shipped because they probably (104:11 - 104:16)
all just typed in there like password 1 (104:14 - 104:17)
2 3 their test dummy accounts to make (104:16 - 104:20)
sure it worked but like I helped (104:17 - 104:23)
probably 50 60 plus people that night of (104:20 - 104:26)
just like hey I have iOS and I are like (104:23 - 104:28)
I can't login and my question was do you (104:26 - 104:29)
have iOS and Android and they would say (104:28 - 104:31)
iOS and I would say don't use face ID or (104:29 - 104:32)
touch ID and they would say oh my gosh (104:31 - 104:33)
that worked (104:32 - 104:35)
look the Pokemon company ain't paying me (104:33 - 104:38)
to do tech support but I was able to I (104:35 - 104:41)
was it I was able to help 50 plus people (104:38 - 104:43)
that night just by saying manually type (104:41 - 104:46)
in your password I don't know what the (104:43 - 104:48)
where the where I was going with that (104:46 - 104:50)
but those issues in general can (104:48 - 104:52)
definitely turn somebody off to be like (104:50 - 104:53)
well it just doesn't work I guess I'm (104:52 - 104:56)
not using it right and it doesn't help (104:53 - 105:00)
that the English App Store says nothing (104:56 - 105:02)
but bug fix every time they've updated (105:00 - 105:05)
the app where I go it is so frustrating (105:02 - 105:08)
I go to minimum do that Japanese support (105:05 - 105:11)
page and I hit Google Translate it does (105:08 - 105:13)
actually say what these issues fixed so (105:11 - 105:16)
that's how I know 1.0.7 fixed face ID (105:13 - 105:17)
cuz it literally says that in the (105:16 - 105:21)
official Japanese support page it tells (105:17 - 105:23)
you everything they fix but the English (105:21 - 105:25)
page it just says fixed bugs like I (105:23 - 105:29)
don't know what the I mean there may be (105:25 - 105:31)
a Japanese legal requirement that if you (105:29 - 105:32)
do update an application you have to (105:31 - 105:34)
specify exactly what your updates are (105:32 - 105:38)
doing can we yes we like have you met (105:34 - 105:42)
our government yeah but the personal (105:38 - 105:45)
person who updated resolve error 999 17 (105:42 - 105:47)
hours ago on support da Pokemon comm (105:45 - 105:50)
like why can't they just I don't know it (105:47 - 105:52)
just it's very frustrating that like (105:50 - 105:53)
we're not seeing the issues being fixed (105:52 - 105:55)
well that's part of the American legal (105:53 - 105:57)
system has never admit that you did (105:55 - 105:59)
anything wrong and it fern just say you (105:57 - 106:02)
fix blood yes because nobody can sue you (105:59 - 106:05)
for an ambiguous we fix the bugs they (106:02 - 106:07)
can sue you for face ID wasn't working (106:05 - 106:09)
and therefore I lost productivity of my (106:07 - 106:12)
job because specifically pace ID wasn't (106:09 - 106:14)
working that's just how America works (106:12 - 106:18)
well that's all you can I do my Pokemon (106:14 - 106:20)
home PSA right now it'd be real fast let (106:18 - 106:20)
me hear it (106:20 - 106:24)
no take your time PSA it up my Pokemon (106:20 - 106:27)
home PSA comes in two parts part the (106:24 - 106:31)
first if I am doing a max raid battle in (106:27 - 106:35)
Pokemon sword and or shield and you show (106:31 - 106:37)
up for my max raid with your shiny kill (106:35 - 106:40)
do where there has never been a shiny (106:37 - 106:44)
kill do possible you're gonna get banned (106:40 - 106:49)
number one part the second if you show (106:44 - 106:51)
up for my max raid battle in Pokemon (106:49 - 106:55)
sort sword and/or shield and it's a (106:51 - 106:58)
toxicity and you bring in your shiny (106:55 - 107:01)
vileplume because you wanna flex that (106:58 - 107:04)
you have a shiny vileplume you gonna get (107:01 - 107:06)
banned (107:04 - 107:08)
all right that's my PSA right there (107:06 - 107:12)
gotta get banned it is amazing it's why (107:08 - 107:14)
I mean it has calmed down but literally (107:12 - 107:16)
like on the first two or three days (107:14 - 107:17)
after Pokemon home everybody was (107:16 - 107:19)
bringing their shinies into Max raids (107:17 - 107:22)
like no matter how useless they were (107:19 - 107:24)
against the Pokemon we were max rating (107:22 - 107:27)
against and I was just like I got so (107:24 - 107:29)
incredibly frustrated and then I also (107:27 - 107:32)
discovered that like if I was playing (107:29 - 107:35)
during prime Japanese hours so like (107:32 - 107:37)
early early morning in the United States (107:35 - 107:39)
the max raids were normal and people (107:37 - 107:40)
brought normal Pokemon that would be (107:39 - 107:43)
super effective against the the Pokemon (107:40 - 107:45)
we were trying to get if I was playing (107:43 - 107:46)
in the evening everybody was doing their (107:45 - 107:49)
shiny flexes and you know all the the US (107:46 - 107:51)
times it was all shiny flexes who's (107:49 - 107:54)
ridiculous it's at yeah it's like I (107:51 - 107:55)
don't know it's probably the same person (107:54 - 107:57)
that would also like they need to let (107:55 - 108:00)
you know how long their hunt was and how (107:57 - 108:04)
many unfortunately they got 18 different (108:00 - 108:07)
shinies before they got this one so they (108:04 - 108:09)
need to let you know the stress and (108:07 - 108:11)
turmoil they went through before their (108:09 - 108:14)
sign name is Steve they documented as a (108:11 - 108:19)
video and put it up well that's like but (108:14 - 108:22)
what's funny for me is I do my little (108:19 - 108:24)
shiny hunts on snapchat every day and (108:22 - 108:28)
like invariably like every three or four (108:24 - 108:29)
months somebody says how many eggs have (108:28 - 108:33)
you hatched but I don't know I'm not (108:29 - 108:38)
writing down one time where I like (108:33 - 108:42)
kata-kata what what legendary was it I (108:38 - 108:45)
remember it was in Pokemon go but I (108:42 - 108:46)
walked all the way out to the end of (108:45 - 108:49)
this park there was a bunch of us it (108:46 - 108:51)
might have been armored me too or (108:49 - 108:52)
something so we all did the raid I (108:51 - 108:56)
caught them you too and then I like as (108:52 - 108:57)
soon as I caught it I like caught like a (108:56 - 108:59)
Jigglypuff or something that was was (108:57 - 109:02)
like around the gym this one dude look (108:59 - 109:04)
at me and he was like what Ivy's did you (109:02 - 109:06)
get I was like what he was like you're (109:04 - 109:08)
mute to your Mewtwo what Ivies did you (109:06 - 109:11)
get I was like I don't know man I didn't (109:08 - 109:13)
I didn't check and he like threw up his (109:11 - 109:16)
like frustrated that I didn't know where (109:13 - 109:19)
everybody asked he's like but prefer for (109:16 - 109:21)
Rhyhorn ride on day whatever yesterday (109:19 - 109:23)
and people were like did you get any (109:21 - 109:29)
four stars like I don't know never (109:23 - 109:33)
baited to that at all like geez that's (109:29 - 109:36)
just look I got I had 3000 plus Pokemon (109:33 - 109:39)
in my Pokemon home I'm not saying that (109:36 - 109:41)
the flex I'm saying that I like to catch (109:39 - 109:43)
pokemon and they exist and they're doing (109:41 - 109:46)
something there's they're generating (109:43 - 109:48)
those homeboy at some points I mean at (109:46 - 109:51)
the end of the day I don't care I was (109:48 - 109:53)
like I really need them for competitive (109:51 - 109:55)
purposes a bottle cap them or something (109:53 - 109:57)
I don't know what you want from me (109:55 - 110:00)
all right enough Pokemon home it's (109:57 - 110:03)
gotten seven updates in less than two (110:00 - 110:06)
weeks Pokemon bank had only got four (110:03 - 110:10)
updates and seven years so so I get (110:06 - 110:12)
winning on the bugs I guess that's (110:10 - 110:15)
better I guess yeah I guess that's a (110:12 - 110:17)
good sign for the future baby I suppose (110:15 - 110:19)
that the Apple only get better if (110:17 - 110:21)
they've updated it this many times this (110:19 - 110:23)
quickly so fingers crossed that that (110:21 - 110:25)
that in like two weeks they just stopped (110:23 - 110:27)
caring and never push out any updates (110:25 - 110:30)
Greg give us our question of the week Oh (110:27 - 110:32)
friends from slack you know how to keep (110:30 - 110:36)
our interest piqued with your questions (110:32 - 110:40)
of the week let's hear the question of (110:36 - 110:44)
the week yeah I was like let's hear the (110:40 - 110:48)
question we start from jet see if you (110:44 - 110:50)
were getting married who would be in (110:48 - 110:52)
your wedding party could be Pokemon or (110:50 - 110:55)
characters from the anime slash games (110:52 - 110:57)
for totals that includes the best man (110:55 - 111:01)
slash best woman it has to be from the (110:57 - 111:03)
series is this what we're saying well no (111:01 - 111:04)
people on our characters from anime (111:03 - 111:10)
slash games okay I first off this is (111:04 - 111:13)
like one of those like Zen impossible to (111:10 - 111:16)
answer questions because Steve's already (111:13 - 111:17)
married (111:16 - 111:20)
Greg's already married I'm unmarriable (111:17 - 111:25)
so okay if suddenly characters from (111:20 - 111:28)
Pokemon and Pokemon were coming back to (111:25 - 111:31)
life or became reality I would renew (111:28 - 111:32)
them vows (111:31 - 111:34)
yeah you can always renew your vows you (111:32 - 111:36)
can married again you get married same (111:34 - 111:37)
person twice right I mean I can't get (111:36 - 111:39)
married for the first time so well maybe (111:37 - 111:42)
if there was a wicked tongue standing (111:39 - 111:46)
next to you yeah no not my bag only if (111:42 - 111:51)
it knows body-slammed ah oh is that what (111:46 - 111:55)

diantha would be in my party I would (112:15 - 112:20)
have to Anthon my party I mean she's a (112:18 - 112:23)
washed-up what was she a movie star (112:20 - 112:27)
where she is hardly washed-up I don't (112:23 - 112:29)
know about that I mean Rose arrayed (112:27 - 112:32)
would be my best person (112:29 - 112:35)
um I think it would go produce flowers (112:32 - 112:36)
like none other (112:35 - 112:40)
yeah likes hello and then it probably go (112:36 - 112:41)
Wallace (112:40 - 112:46)
Kakui diantha that's a good party enough (112:41 - 112:47)
and then I would fight every else I I (112:46 - 112:50)
would I would be guilted into sending (112:47 - 112:53)
alder an invite I guaranteed and then (112:50 - 112:57)
mmm because you know altars gonna drink (112:53 - 113:01)
know it here yeah you know I would have (112:57 - 113:03)
to say I'd probably have to bring I (113:01 - 113:06)
can't invite Sycamore he's he's too (113:03 - 113:08)
good-looking of a guy he'd be too (113:06 - 113:10)
distracting but you would probably want (113:08 - 113:13)
to invite the bride's get a runoff with (113:10 - 113:15)
Sycamore yeah yeah that's this (113:13 - 113:17)
Robinson's issue that's the worry i I (113:15 - 113:20)
you probably invite Professor Oak cuz (113:17 - 113:22)
you'd have some good stories to tell for (113:20 - 113:24)
those that don't want to be on the dance (113:22 - 113:24)
floor (113:24 - 113:26)
he is going to complain about the food (113:24 - 113:30)
and be in bed by 8:00 I'm sure he might (113:26 - 113:32)
he might leave the party really early (113:30 - 113:34)
who's gonna go pick up professor oak and (113:32 - 113:36)
who he has to drive professor oak oh (113:34 - 113:42)
okay I'm not that old I feel like I have (113:36 - 113:43)
to have Pikachu in the wedding party (113:42 - 113:48)
just because it's Pikachu sellout I have (113:43 - 113:50)
to have brachot I have to have Brock at (113:48 - 113:52)
the wedding the thing is if you invite (113:50 - 113:54)
Brock at the wedding you have to assign (113:52 - 113:58)
somebody to keep an eye on Brock because (113:54 - 114:01)
he is that guy at the wedding that is (113:58 - 114:05)
hoping to make the connection at your (114:01 - 114:06)
wedding and is making everybody (114:05 - 114:10)
uncomfortable yeah or Brock's gonna be (114:06 - 114:12)
the one who's like during your reception (114:10 - 114:21)
proposes to have you guys ever been to a (114:12 - 114:23)
wedding where somebody pulled that the (114:21 - 114:28)
leg oh heck no oh yes you have was it as (114:23 - 114:33)
awful as it seems um the answer is yes (114:28 - 114:36)
is it as awful as it seems no cuz you (114:33 - 114:38)
are imagining it to be much more (114:36 - 114:39)
cringe-worthy than it actually is (114:38 - 114:41)
because the reason what keeps it less (114:39 - 114:44)
cringe-worthy is because a half of the (114:41 - 114:45)
people at the wedding (114:44 - 114:46)
are (114:45 - 114:50)
on board for that to happen and they (114:46 - 114:54)
Buffett everybody else going how could (114:50 - 114:56)
you even think this was appropriate and (114:54 - 114:59)
so you have like you have like the shock (114:56 - 115:01)
of people of the people who are like (114:59 - 115:04)
what are you doing who are staring at (115:01 - 115:05)
this oncoming train (115:04 - 115:10)
and then the Oh starts from the idiot (115:05 - 115:13)
Brigade think that this is appropriate (115:10 - 115:16)
and charming and then you're all swept (115:13 - 115:18)
up in this and you're looking at the (115:16 - 115:23)
bride who has hit the roof and the bride (115:18 - 115:26)
mate is just handing drink after drink (115:23 - 115:29)
to calm the situation down and then it (115:26 - 115:32)
passes and then you all laugh about it (115:29 - 115:33)
and then everybody gets really drunk and (115:32 - 115:36)
helps to forget it so it's not as bad (115:33 - 115:39)
but it's pretty bad but I have been (115:36 - 115:43)
there yes a number on an unfortunate (115:39 - 115:45)
amount of occasion fortunate amount holy (115:43 - 115:48)
cow yeah man if that happens at my (115:45 - 115:50)
wedding it happened in my own family my (115:48 - 115:53)
own cousin did it to my other cousin oh (115:50 - 115:56)
my gosh Oh (115:53 - 115:56)
horror back to the question of the week (115:56 - 116:01)
this is a really hard question for me to (116:00 - 116:05)
answer because if some weird planets (116:01 - 116:08)
aligned to stars shifted in the sky for (116:05 - 116:10)
me to actually end up getting married (116:08 - 116:12)
you guys would probably find out about (116:10 - 116:13)
it like two months after it actually (116:12 - 116:15)
happened because I just like get it done (116:13 - 116:17)
at the city hall and like not even (116:15 - 116:20)
mention it you what - you're so rude (116:17 - 116:23)
okay here that's not rude that's like I (116:20 - 116:25)
said you guys the expense in the travel (116:23 - 116:29)
and all that way in the same city good (116:25 - 116:30)

sword and shield you go under the vs. (123:27 - 123:32)
menu you go to online competitions and (123:29 - 123:35)
then you hit sign up as always you do (123:32 - 123:39)
not need your team ready and you need to (123:35 - 123:42)
at least play in one complete match win (123:39 - 123:44)
or lose in order to get your ball guy a (123:42 - 123:46)

squabbit a rook a D and a feeble and (123:46 - 123:54)
just lose you are more than welcome to (123:51 - 123:56)
to get your bottle guy t-shirt also (123:54 - 123:59)
isn't it Devils she'd have to pick (123:56 - 124:01)
though you'd have to figure one more (123:59 - 124:03)
also uh because this always happens (124:01 - 124:05)
every time you don't get your t-shirt (124:03 - 124:06)
right away you have to wait till (124:05 - 124:08)

two weeks so even if you do your match (124:08 - 124:15)
participate they could post rankings the (124:11 - 124:17)
following Monday or they could post post (124:15 - 124:20)
rankings a month later it's just how (124:17 - 124:22)
fast they need to calculate rankings (124:20 - 124:25)
they seem to be doing a lot faster in (124:22 - 124:27)
sword and shield than they did in Sun (124:25 - 124:29)

uneventful like the previous year's (124:55 - 125:00)
[Laughter] (124:58 - 125:02)
maybe something will happen I am (125:00 - 125:05)

they're going to rotate some Pokemon and (125:05 - 125:09)
raids I know toxicity is around till the (125:07 - 125:12)
8th of March I'm assuming they will add (125:09 - 125:14)
a new raid Pokemon (125:12 - 125:18)
Gengar I'm assuming Pokemon masters will (125:14 - 125:20)
have some new characters that are not (125:18 - 125:22)
announced officially but probably (125:20 - 125:24)
sitting on the data link leaked I'm (125:22 - 125:25)
assuming Pokemon Center will have new (125:24 - 125:28)
