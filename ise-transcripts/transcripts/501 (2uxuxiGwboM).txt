before (2:10 - 2:14)
pokemon day (2:12 - 2:18)
oh actually like before what (2:14 - 2:21)
so we could spend the entire episode (2:18 - 2:25)
speculating speculating (2:21 - 2:26)
but at this point i don't care (2:25 - 2:29)
[Laughter] (2:26 - 2:33)
we're going to get gen 9 dlc for arceus (2:29 - 2:34)
they're just going to skip putting out a (2:33 - 2:36)
different game well you know recording (2:34 - 2:38)
this episode is doing nothing for my uh (2:36 - 2:42)
pikmin bloom community dance that's true (2:38 - 2:44)
i recorded 10 000 steps in sitting in (2:42 - 2:46)
this chair (2:44 - 2:47)
record as fast as possible so we can (2:46 - 2:49)
pick them in bloom i we do have a lot of (2:47 - 2:51)
news um (2:49 - 2:53)
the speculation for pokemon day is going (2:51 - 2:54)
to be the same as everyone else it's (2:53 - 2:57)
like maybe gen 9 maybe jojo remix maybe (2:54 - 2:59)
black and white maybe omega ruby alpha (2:57 - 3:03)
sapphire 2 maybe hey you pikachu 4 maybe (2:59 - 3:06)
pokemon shuffle redux maybe (3:03 - 3:08)
wait did we say pokemon y (3:06 - 3:12)
pokemon grey all the third versions (3:08 - 3:12)
yes (3:12 - 3:15)
and then if you just keep saying pokemon (3:13 - 3:18)
sleep every single day you'll eventually (3:15 - 3:20)
be right so (3:18 - 3:21)
that's something i'm saying beetlejuice (3:20 - 3:23)
you say it enough times is eventually (3:21 - 3:24)
going to pop up i don't think i've ever (3:23 - 3:26)
seen that movie from start to finish (3:24 - 3:29)
what (3:26 - 3:29)
that's just (3:29 - 3:33)
podcast out there i've seen like some of (3:30 - 3:35)
edward scissorhands that's like the same (3:33 - 3:37)

every day we have to deal with he (3:48 - 3:52)
doesn't know how to heat up soup (3:50 - 3:53)
every day (3:52 - 3:57)
not every day not only have i seen the (3:53 - 3:59)
beetlejuice movie (3:57 - 4:01)
i was a huge fan of the beetlejuice (3:59 - 4:04)
cartoon cartoon was so good it was so (4:01 - 4:08)
good it's so like underrated i want to (4:04 - 4:09)
see the musical (4:08 - 4:10)
uh (4:09 - 4:12)
broadway's dead for me (4:10 - 4:15)

not (4:15 - 4:20)
well after i put down that de-icer yeah (4:17 - 4:22)
you're right yeah (4:20 - 4:22)
speaking of dead this will be our first (4:24 - 4:30)
news article here it's actually off (4:27 - 4:32)
nintendo america's twitter the official (4:30 - 4:33)
twitter (4:32 - 4:36)
as of late march 2023 it will no longer (4:33 - 4:38)
be possible to make nintendo eshop (4:36 - 4:40)
purchases from the wii u and the (4:38 - 4:43)
nintendo 3ds family of systems (4:40 - 4:44)
oh (4:43 - 4:48)
my word i almost got into an argument on (4:44 - 4:50)
tuesday night and i decided to just was (4:48 - 4:52)
it tuesday or was it no it was tuesday (4:50 - 4:55)
night and i almost had to step away but (4:52 - 4:57)
read get article me and we'll figure out (4:55 - 5:00)
if i was in the right or not go ahead (4:57 - 5:03)
the if you just read that tweet it's (5:00 - 5:05)
very misleading (5:03 - 5:08)
uh because things get worse a lot (5:05 - 5:10)
quicker than you would expect (5:08 - 5:13)
so uh they do have like a read more here (5:10 - 5:15)
that i'm sure no one ever clicked (5:13 - 5:17)
uh because most people just read (5:15 - 5:18)
headlines and then move on with their (5:17 - 5:21)
lives a headline has it all (5:18 - 5:24)
i get i i get angry off the headline and (5:21 - 5:28)
what more do i need i got my rush (5:24 - 5:30)
so they so the (5:28 - 5:32)
support.nintendo.com article says as of (5:30 - 5:34)
late march 2023 it will no longer be (5:32 - 5:36)
possible to purchase nintendo eshop uh (5:34 - 5:38)
purchases of the nintendo eshop for the (5:36 - 5:41)
wii u and the 3ds it will also no longer (5:38 - 5:42)
be possible to download free content (5:41 - 5:45)
including game demos furthermore as this (5:42 - 5:47)
date draws closer relative related (5:45 - 5:49)
services they could be relatives we'll (5:47 - 5:51)
cease to function (5:49 - 5:53)
so here's the big here's the big thing (5:51 - 5:58)
as of may 23rd 2022 (5:53 - 5:59)
which is in like (5:58 - 6:00)
two months (5:59 - 6:02)
two months (6:00 - 6:06)
you can no longer add a credit card (6:02 - 6:10)
to add funds to your account to make (6:06 - 6:13)
purchases for the wii u or the 3ds (6:10 - 6:15)
systems (6:13 - 6:15)
that's pretty big (6:16 - 6:21)
yeah (6:18 - 6:24)
that uh restricts you to then only going (6:21 - 6:26)
out and buying (6:24 - 6:30)
the uh cards (6:26 - 6:30)
or paypal (6:30 - 6:33)
didn't i think they had paypal (6:31 - 6:35)
maybe not (6:33 - 6:36)
they don't mention paypal at all here so (6:35 - 6:38)
i don't want to paypal if i already have (6:36 - 6:41)
a card stored there because i do (6:38 - 6:45)
i do too oh that's a good one (6:41 - 6:47)
you'll no longer be possible to use no (6:45 - 6:49)
it says you cannot use a credit card to (6:47 - 6:51)
add okay okay (6:49 - 6:52)
uh (6:51 - 6:56)
as of august 29 2022 it will no longer (6:52 - 6:59)
be possible to use a nintendo eshop card (6:56 - 7:03)
to add funds to a nintendo eshop uh (6:59 - 7:06)
account on both the wii u and the 3ds's (7:03 - 7:09)
however it is still possible to redeem (7:06 - 7:14)
the cards as of march of 2023 stock up (7:09 - 7:17)
this is it go to go to gamestop get them (7:14 - 7:18)
all buy them out (7:17 - 7:20)
because i'm out of the three of us the (7:18 - 7:22)
only person that still has a wii u (7:20 - 7:25)
plugged into a television set okay i (7:22 - 7:27)
have my wii u but it's not (7:25 - 7:31)
plugged in charged used on the occasion (7:27 - 7:33)
number one issue (7:31 - 7:35)
i have some games (7:33 - 7:39)
that are not stored on my wii u (7:35 - 7:40)
i used to have them stored on an (7:39 - 7:42)
external drive that external drive has (7:40 - 7:44)
died i forgot that was a thing for the (7:42 - 7:48)
wii u if i do not get them down (7:44 - 7:49)
in time (7:48 - 7:52)
i will lose them (7:49 - 7:54)
so now i have to do the calculation of (7:52 - 7:56)
do i get another external drive to put (7:54 - 7:59)
bayonetta and bayonetta two on or do i (7:56 - 8:01)
just buy them for this (7:59 - 8:02)
but (8:01 - 8:05)
which is which is gonna be cheaper (8:02 - 8:07)
it's gonna be cheaper to buy the new (8:05 - 8:08)
version no it's like because you can get (8:07 - 8:11)
a hard drive for like (8:08 - 8:12)
ten dollars or something i don't know (8:11 - 8:14)
i've already spent so much money on (8:12 - 8:16)
those games that's true i'm i'm swimming (8:14 - 8:19)
in external hard drives give me give me (8:16 - 8:21)
uh steve could give me one for free and (8:19 - 8:24)
then i don't yeah you want one i got him (8:21 - 8:26)
but okay the other issue and the issue (8:24 - 8:28)
that i almost got into an argument on (8:26 - 8:29)
tuesday night about (8:28 - 8:30)
was (8:29 - 8:33)
someone at the card shop said (8:30 - 8:36)
pokemon bank is gonna be free (8:33 - 8:39)
because they're turning off the servers (8:36 - 8:41)
so they can't charge you for it anymore (8:39 - 8:44)
that's and i'm like kind of true (8:41 - 8:46)
it's kind of true (8:44 - 8:47)
but (8:46 - 8:51)
it will be free of march of 2023 so if (8:47 - 8:53)
you are excited or being like finally (8:51 - 8:55)
it's going to be free and you're going (8:53 - 8:58)
to wait 13 months to save five dollars (8:55 - 8:59)
but we've got some weird priorities (8:58 - 9:01)
happening wait why (8:59 - 9:03)
are they not next week going to come out (9:01 - 9:05)
with an announcement saying (9:03 - 9:07)
we're discontinuing pokemon bank because (9:05 - 9:10)
there's no 3ds anymore (9:07 - 9:11)
you have to move your stuff to pokemon (9:10 - 9:13)
home or say goodbye (9:11 - 9:14)
what is this belief that they're going (9:13 - 9:16)
to already announce that bank is going (9:14 - 9:17)
free for (9:16 - 9:18)
a while (9:17 - 9:21)
okay okay i just like i i have it here (9:18 - 9:23)
off pokemon.com all right it says (9:21 - 9:25)
pokemon bank services will be available (9:23 - 9:27)
at no cost to players (9:25 - 9:30)
paid passes will be discontinued but (9:27 - 9:32)
users will still be able to access some (9:30 - 9:33)
features including transferring their (9:32 - 9:35)
pokemon to pokemon home (9:33 - 9:37)
with the disco discontinuation of the (9:35 - 9:39)
nintendo eshop service the nintendo 3ds (9:37 - 9:41)
families of systems the pokemon bank (9:39 - 9:43)
service for the nintendo 3ds will become (9:41 - 9:45)
available at no cost to users you will (9:43 - 9:47)
still be able to enjoy (9:45 - 9:48)
you will still be able to transfer the (9:47 - 9:51)
pokemon you've deposited in bank to home (9:48 - 9:54)
even after the paid service discontinued (9:51 - 9:55)
and you will be able to bring pokemon (9:54 - 9:58)
into bank from compatible titles however (9:55 - 9:59)
you need to be enrolled in the paid (9:58 - 10:02)
pokemon home premium plan to do so (9:59 - 10:06)
in mar in late march of 2023 pokemon (10:02 - 10:09)
paid pass will no longer be offered (10:06 - 10:11)
at which time pokemon bank and pokemon (10:09 - 10:13)
transporter will no longer be available (10:11 - 10:16)
to download on the same day trainers (10:13 - 10:18)
will be able to start using pokemon bank (10:16 - 10:20)
at no cost be aware that there are no (10:18 - 10:22)
refunds for the paid passes already been (10:20 - 10:24)
purchased there is no end date planned (10:22 - 10:25)
or (10:24 - 10:27)
for the no cost service any further (10:25 - 10:29)
changes will be announced on pokemon.com (10:27 - 10:32)
and elsewhere (10:29 - 10:35)
the fact that like companies or like the (10:32 - 10:38)
media outlets like polygon or ign was (10:35 - 10:40)
like pokemon bank is going free (10:38 - 10:41)
again (10:40 - 10:44)
in 13 months (10:41 - 10:46)
and the cost of pokemon bank per year is (10:44 - 10:47)
five (10:46 - 10:48)
dollars (10:47 - 10:52)
the headline isn't wrong (10:48 - 10:54)
it's going (10:52 - 10:56)
free correct (10:54 - 10:58)
they don't need to put a time frame in (10:56 - 11:00)
the headline read the article that's (10:58 - 11:02)
what it's there for you you take the (11:00 - 11:06)
bait and then you read their stuff (11:02 - 11:06)
or you don't take the bait you read the (11:06 - 11:10)
headline and then you get into arguments (11:08 - 11:14)
with will at the card shop (11:10 - 11:14)
uh some some things i want to mention (11:16 - 11:21)
here for 3ds eshop stuff uh i would (11:18 - 11:23)
probably recommend downloading the sun (11:21 - 11:25)
and moon demo (11:23 - 11:28)
because it is a different (11:25 - 11:31)
it is a like unique demo it's not one of (11:28 - 11:33)
those like play the first 10 minutes of (11:31 - 11:35)
pokemon and then replay the first 10 (11:33 - 11:36)
minutes of pokemon the sun and moon demo (11:35 - 11:38)
is unique and at the end of it you do (11:36 - 11:40)
get ash greninja and then you can (11:38 - 11:43)
transfer ash greninja into (11:40 - 11:44)
um (11:43 - 11:46)
bank and then bank into home (11:44 - 11:47)
uh (11:46 - 11:50)
because it has a baby alpha sapphire was (11:47 - 11:51)
like that too because you could get the (11:50 - 11:52)
mega glaily (11:51 - 11:54)
yeah but what could you get there's a (11:52 - 11:57)
demo (11:54 - 11:57)
what could you get from that demo i (11:58 - 12:01)
don't remember (12:00 - 12:03)
um so the i would i would recommend (12:01 - 12:04)
downloading the sun and moon demo it's (12:03 - 12:07)
free uh if you want to get ash greninja (12:04 - 12:09)
oh my gosh it takes maybe like 30 (12:07 - 12:11)
minutes to get through it (12:09 - 12:13)
it probably and it also has like (12:11 - 12:15)
more kahili dialogue than actual sun and (12:13 - 12:17)
moon has (12:15 - 12:19)
uh the other thing i would recommend is (12:17 - 12:21)
if you're an actual (12:19 - 12:24)
hardcore pokemon fan i would download (12:21 - 12:27)
pokemon dream radar it's 299. (12:24 - 12:30)
uh it gives you the therian forms of (12:27 - 12:32)
landorus thunderous and tornados (12:30 - 12:35)
uh also if you were to put in like (12:32 - 12:37)
a copy of (12:35 - 12:40)
heartgold you get like a dreamball ho-oh (12:37 - 12:41)
putting a copy of platinum you get (12:40 - 12:44)
dreambog giratina put a copy of pearl (12:41 - 12:46)
you get dreamball palkia (12:44 - 12:49)
uh the only problem with dream radar is (12:46 - 12:49)
it (12:49 - 12:51)
existed before like (12:49 - 12:54)
timed mobile games really took off (12:51 - 12:55)
so you're only allowed to play dream (12:54 - 12:57)
radar for like (12:55 - 12:58)
15 minutes a day (12:57 - 13:00)
and then you're like exhausted from (12:58 - 13:01)
energy and you have to come back the (13:00 - 13:04)
next day also it uses ar and it's really (13:01 - 13:06)
bad and awful but if you want those (13:04 - 13:08)
pokemon i just listed in dreamballs uh (13:06 - 13:10)
for 2.99 you can have them all after (13:08 - 13:13)
like 60 days of playing (13:10 - 13:15)
well you also have three times (13:13 - 13:18)
to catch them because it's it's not 100 (13:15 - 13:23)
that easy to play the actual game (13:18 - 13:25)
i don't remember being i just sat in the (13:23 - 13:27)
swirly chair and (13:25 - 13:28)
spun around (13:27 - 13:30)
you must be the dust chair that spins in (13:28 - 13:32)
a circle otherwise you're never gonna (13:30 - 13:33)
beat that game (13:32 - 13:36)
i mean that is literally (13:33 - 13:38)
everybody's life everybody now who works (13:36 - 13:40)
from home has a spinning desk care and (13:38 - 13:42)
if you are (13:40 - 13:43)
with your parents who work for whom they (13:42 - 13:46)
have a spinning dish there just say hey (13:43 - 13:48)
parental unit please allow me to spin a (13:46 - 13:52)
new chair i gotta catch some pokemans (13:48 - 13:52)
uh going back to the support.nintendo (13:52 - 13:56)
article it says even after late march of (13:54 - 13:58)
2023 and for the foreseeable future it (13:56 - 14:00)
is it will still be possible to (13:58 - 14:02)
redownload games and dlc receive (14:00 - 14:04)
software updates and enjoy online play (14:02 - 14:06)
on the wii u and the nintendo 3ds family (14:04 - 14:08)
of systems (14:06 - 14:10)
so you still can download your (14:08 - 14:12)
bayonettas okay okay (14:10 - 14:14)
i mean this is like their hey don't make (14:12 - 14:15)
any more purchases because we're going (14:14 - 14:18)
to shut the service down in x amount of (14:15 - 14:20)
years (14:18 - 14:20)
they have a q a (14:22 - 14:26)
first question is why is this happening (14:24 - 14:28)
their answer (14:26 - 14:30)
this is part of the natural life cycle (14:28 - 14:32)
for any product line as it becomes less (14:30 - 14:34)
used by consumers over time (14:32 - 14:38)
uh the natural life cycle of (14:34 - 14:38)
the storage space that one single (14:38 - 14:43)
digital game takes on a surfer (14:40 - 14:45)
well (14:43 - 14:46)
look do you know how many trees they (14:45 - 14:48)
have to burn to keep (14:46 - 14:51)
access to pokemon bank going (14:48 - 14:52)
uh (14:51 - 14:54)
yeah so let's to shift gears back to (14:52 - 14:57)
like the pokemon bank thing (14:54 - 14:57)
if pokemon bank (14:57 - 15:03)
slash (15:01 - 15:06)
it's not even pokemon bank it's that it (15:03 - 15:07)
when nintendo decides to shut down these (15:06 - 15:10)
servers which they they will (15:07 - 15:13)
eventually that shuts down servers for (15:10 - 15:14)
all games (15:13 - 15:16)
it's what happened on the ds (15:14 - 15:18)
that's why you can't wonder trade (15:16 - 15:21)
anymore in in (15:18 - 15:22)
black and white (15:21 - 15:24)
black and white have one trade right (15:22 - 15:25)
yeah (15:24 - 15:27)
something like that did it (15:25 - 15:29)
at dreamworld maybe you can't dream (15:27 - 15:31)
world anymore (15:29 - 15:31)
yeah (15:31 - 15:34)
gts (15:31 - 15:36)
online trade there you go simplify it (15:34 - 15:37)
you can't online trade in black and (15:36 - 15:39)
white or diamond (15:37 - 15:42)
pearl and then there's going to be one (15:39 - 15:44)
person typing an angry email that they (15:42 - 15:46)
connected to some fan-made dns server to (15:44 - 15:48)
be able to trade yeah that exists which (15:46 - 15:50)
reminds me i have another (15:48 - 15:52)
point of contention with the two of you (15:50 - 15:54)
but let's get through this why are you (15:52 - 15:56)
always mad at us we are never mad at you (15:54 - 15:59)
yeah we're providing valuable things you (15:56 - 16:01)
guys say weird things that don't make (15:59 - 16:03)
sense and then i'm like why did they say (16:01 - 16:07)
this weird thing i don't understand (16:03 - 16:09)
um (16:07 - 16:11)
so (16:09 - 16:15)
yeah pokemon bank will be free in 13 (16:11 - 16:16)
months for the foreseeable future that (16:15 - 16:18)
foreseeable future is when nintendo (16:16 - 16:21)
decides to cut the online altogether (16:18 - 16:23)
which forces pokemon bank to no longer (16:21 - 16:24)
work (16:23 - 16:28)
so if that hap if and when that happens (16:24 - 16:31)
you are now cutting off (16:28 - 16:34)
ruby and sapphire and gale of darkness (16:31 - 16:36)
and coliseum the oldest pokemon games (16:34 - 16:38)
you can get pokemon in (16:36 - 16:41)
up to (16:38 - 16:43)
sword and shield (16:41 - 16:45)
well i guess technically (16:43 - 16:47)
you can't move things into let's go but (16:45 - 16:49)
so they're going to announce remakes of (16:47 - 16:51)
gayle of darkness for pokemon day (16:49 - 16:52)
yeah (16:51 - 16:56)
for it 60 shadow pokemon yeah (16:52 - 16:58)
shadolugia (16:56 - 17:00)
a hundred people to battle on a mountain (16:58 - 17:02)
no it's not shadow lugia that's apex (17:00 - 17:05)
lugia come on (17:02 - 17:08)
we'll get to that news (17:05 - 17:08)
they have said before they as in like (17:13 - 17:18)
masuda and amore have said before they (17:15 - 17:19)
don't want to make the mistake that they (17:18 - 17:21)
made (17:19 - 17:22)
between (17:21 - 17:26)
the game boy and the game boy advance (17:22 - 17:27)
and that was like kind of out of their (17:26 - 17:29)
control because that was like hardware (17:27 - 17:31)
stuff like they didn't design the (17:29 - 17:34)
gameboy advanced to the gameboy like (17:31 - 17:35)
that was (17:34 - 17:37)
that was also (17:35 - 17:39)
it was supposed to end in gold silver (17:37 - 17:42)
like i don't think they had a huge plans (17:39 - 17:44)
in which a nintendo like work hey make (17:42 - 17:46)
sure these are compatible because i (17:44 - 17:47)
think most people when they were (17:46 - 17:49)
developing it all that said oh well this (17:47 - 17:52)
is the final part of the pokemon series (17:49 - 17:54)
and then it didn't end (17:52 - 17:56)
yeah (17:54 - 17:57)
and they're like we have to now come up (17:56 - 18:00)
with more pokemon uh electric i don't (17:57 - 18:01)
know (18:00 - 18:02)
uh (18:01 - 18:03)
let's put in three of the greatest (18:02 - 18:05)
pokemon we've ever created in gen 3 and (18:03 - 18:07)
make gen 3 the best that's ever been put (18:05 - 18:10)
out (18:07 - 18:10)
so (18:10 - 18:12)
is it going to be in i don't know let's (18:12 - 18:16)
just say three years (18:15 - 18:18)
is it going to be like (18:16 - 18:21)
this is it there's no more transferring (18:18 - 18:23)
from these old pokemon games or is it (18:21 - 18:25)
going to be (18:23 - 18:27)
they are going to come up with something (18:25 - 18:30)
in the next (18:27 - 18:30)
year that like lets you scan a qr code (18:31 - 18:38)
and send it to like we have pokemon home (18:35 - 18:41)
on our phone (18:38 - 18:41)
and i don't think you need online (18:41 - 18:48)
anything to say (18:45 - 18:50)
read the game or the game cartridge in (18:48 - 18:54)
the ds transfer it into this app (18:50 - 18:56)
and then the app generates a qr code or (18:54 - 18:58)
something and then bluetooth or whatever (18:56 - 19:01)
and sends it to the phone (18:58 - 19:03)
right (19:01 - 19:03)
but like that's about to give you a new (19:04 - 19:08)
app for your 3ds right so are they would (19:05 - 19:09)
they make a new app in the next year or (19:08 - 19:11)
two (19:09 - 19:13)
all the 3ds developers (19:11 - 19:15)
are gone (19:13 - 19:15)
um i could see them making a (19:18 - 19:22)
separate service i could see them making (19:22 - 19:30)
a pokemon branded (19:26 - 19:32)
device where it's plug in your old games (19:30 - 19:34)
into this pokemon device and let it read (19:32 - 19:36)
your save file but legally and then (19:34 - 19:38)
we'll extract out the pokemon and send (19:36 - 19:39)
them to home (19:38 - 19:42)
well transporter sends pokemon from the (19:39 - 19:45)
virtual console games directly into (19:42 - 19:47)
bank they could just update transporter (19:45 - 19:49)
to do like (19:47 - 19:50)
hey transport is just (19:49 - 19:52)
from here on out there is no bank (19:50 - 19:54)
there's only transporter and transporter (19:52 - 19:57)
is only sending to home (19:54 - 20:00)
but if there's no (19:57 - 20:01)
online nintendo servers how is it (20:00 - 20:03)
sending it to home without (20:01 - 20:07)
directly sending it locally through a qr (20:03 - 20:09)
code through bluetooth or whatever yeah (20:07 - 20:12)
i imagine there might be (20:09 - 20:12)
something on the switch because switch (20:12 - 20:16)
creates its own (20:14 - 20:17)
when you're sending pictures to your (20:16 - 20:18)
smartphone it creates its own little (20:17 - 20:19)
network (20:18 - 20:21)
and hook it up that way so they may just (20:19 - 20:23)
be like (20:21 - 20:26)
we're making this app on the switch and (20:23 - 20:29)
we're making this dongle that you can (20:26 - 20:30)
attach (20:29 - 20:31)
yeah (20:30 - 20:32)
and you plug them in there it's a (20:31 - 20:34)
pokeball and you plug in your old (20:32 - 20:36)
cartridges and it reads that and then it (20:34 - 20:37)
sends it to your switch (20:36 - 20:42)
see to me the value of old games (20:37 - 20:44)
the price they're worth to me (20:42 - 20:46)
dramatically crashes if i can't transfer (20:44 - 20:48)
them up (20:46 - 20:51)
like that's why i don't care about (20:48 - 20:53)
owning like an original cartridge of (20:51 - 20:54)
pokemon blue (20:53 - 20:56)
the heck am i gonna do with that besides (20:54 - 20:57)
looking like all it's gonna do is (20:56 - 20:58)
collect dust (20:57 - 21:01)
like if i was gonna like i'm not gonna (20:58 - 21:04)
find a super game boy or a game boy (21:01 - 21:07)
advance sp put in my copy of pokemon (21:04 - 21:07)
blue (21:07 - 21:09)
and then like play it and then do (21:07 - 21:10)
nothing with the pokemon at the end if (21:09 - 21:12)
i'm gonna play pokemon blue i'm gonna (21:10 - 21:14)
get the virtual console of pokemon blue (21:12 - 21:16)
where it's convenient i'm gonna play (21:14 - 21:18)
through that and then at the very end i (21:16 - 21:19)
can transfer those pokemon out and (21:18 - 21:21)
what's cool about like the virtual (21:19 - 21:22)
console games is they're all hidden (21:21 - 21:24)
abilities so it's like oh cool i got (21:22 - 21:26)
useless hidden ability me too that i can (21:24 - 21:29)
at least transfer upwards (21:26 - 21:31)
like i just have no desire like if the (21:29 - 21:32)
whole (21:31 - 21:35)
almost i would say most of my love for (21:32 - 21:38)
the series comes from (21:35 - 21:40)
being able to play those old games (21:38 - 21:42)
and then move those pokemon forward it's (21:40 - 21:45)
it's a very pokemon issue right because (21:42 - 21:47)
can you think of another game where (21:45 - 21:48)
there's artifacts from that game that (21:47 - 21:51)
you want to be able to carry forward no (21:48 - 21:55)
it's a very pokemon issue (21:51 - 21:55)
i mean i don't have the same i want to (21:55 - 21:59)
bring clearly because i have not brought (21:57 - 22:01)
brought a ton of (21:59 - 22:02)
stuff up because yeah i know like that's (22:01 - 22:05)
like a very small part of the (22:02 - 22:07)
fan base is like i want to transfer (22:05 - 22:09)
these pokemon forward (22:07 - 22:11)
i mean (22:09 - 22:13)
there is some (22:11 - 22:15)
i honestly think it was a like i know (22:13 - 22:17)
they're worried about it but that was (22:15 - 22:19)
also (22:17 - 22:19)
what 20 years ago when the (22:19 - 22:23)
when (22:22 - 22:25)
the game boy and game boy advance things (22:23 - 22:28)
switched and i think like (22:25 - 22:30)
honestly (22:28 - 22:31)
they it was going to come down they're (22:30 - 22:34)
just going to have to make the call (22:31 - 22:36)
and they've proven that virtual council (22:34 - 22:38)
things sell so that people can play (22:36 - 22:39)
those games again and switch swap (22:38 - 22:41)
pokemon and like there's very little (22:39 - 22:44)
reason in the current marketplace (22:41 - 22:46)
to not be like we'll just create a new (22:44 - 22:48)
virtual console and you can read down (22:46 - 22:49)
those (22:48 - 22:50)
pay those games again and play those (22:49 - 22:51)
games again (22:50 - 22:53)
and you have (22:51 - 22:54)
until (22:53 - 22:57)
whatever time we shut it off to to do (22:54 - 22:58)
all that stuff but it's got an ending (22:57 - 23:00)
because we're going to remake money off (22:58 - 23:02)
of those games once we shut those (23:00 - 23:04)
servers down (23:02 - 23:04)
yeah (23:07 - 23:10)
i mean like a lot of people were like oh (23:09 - 23:12)
but why would they remake blah blah blah (23:10 - 23:13)
blah because you can still play it on (23:12 - 23:15)
those games and you can still transfer (23:13 - 23:17)
those pokemon well that now has an end (23:15 - 23:19)
date that's why they would remake black (23:17 - 23:20)
and white and (23:19 - 23:22)
brilliant diamond shining pearl and all (23:20 - 23:24)
these things because there's well that's (23:22 - 23:26)
why fire red leaf green literally exists (23:24 - 23:27)
yeah it is (23:26 - 23:29)
um because there's just there is an end (23:27 - 23:31)
date and there's always going to be an (23:29 - 23:33)
end date i think (23:31 - 23:36)
pokemon saddled itself (23:33 - 23:37)
to this (23:36 - 23:39)
dead albatross (23:37 - 23:41)
of being able to interact with every (23:39 - 23:43)
every game and bring things up (23:41 - 23:44)
20 years ago and i don't think it was a (23:43 - 23:46)
great decision back then but it's the (23:44 - 23:48)
one they've decided to stick with and (23:46 - 23:50)
it's going to continue to drag them down (23:48 - 23:52)
until they get really creative or just (23:50 - 23:55)
say that's not it seems like (23:52 - 23:56)
the the (23:55 - 23:58)
it's funny because like i still don't (23:56 - 24:02)
think home is worth the cost (23:58 - 24:04)
um (24:02 - 24:06)
what is home 15 a year (24:04 - 24:09)
you get 6 000 pokemon slots (24:06 - 24:11)
which i don't think is enough for (24:09 - 24:13)
somebody paying that much money (24:11 - 24:16)
honestly (24:13 - 24:16)
uh maybe it's maybe because there's two (24:17 - 24:22)
reasons i think that number one is (24:20 - 24:24)
because (24:22 - 24:26)
uh (24:24 - 24:29)
if i am paying to hoard pokemon it is (24:26 - 24:31)
because i'm a hoarder (24:29 - 24:33)
right true (24:31 - 24:36)
and two if i'm paying if i've if i've (24:33 - 24:41)
given niantic 60 70 to hold 4000 pokemon (24:36 - 24:43)
i feel like i should be getting more (24:41 - 24:45)
value out of my 15 (24:43 - 24:46)
in home (24:45 - 24:48)
like like i don't even have an option to (24:46 - 24:51)
expand i'm stuck at six thousand so it's (24:48 - 24:52)
like i have all of these pokemon and i (24:51 - 24:55)
have i have three thousand pokemon and (24:52 - 24:56)
go (24:55 - 24:58)
i have (24:56 - 25:00)
i have caught and thrown away almost 2 (24:58 - 25:02)
000 pokemon in legends (25:00 - 25:04)
i have (25:02 - 25:06)
tons of pokemon still in x and y tons of (25:04 - 25:07)
pokemon in omega ruby tons of pokemon (25:06 - 25:09)
and ultrasound ultramoon (25:07 - 25:13)
tons of i i have two co i have a copy of (25:09 - 25:14)
sword and then i have another like (25:13 - 25:16)
alternate account of sword and the only (25:14 - 25:18)
thing the alternate account of sword is (25:16 - 25:21)
doing is holding more pokemon (25:18 - 25:21)
but (25:23 - 25:28)
pokemon aside this is a pokemon reality (25:24 - 25:29)
show pokemon hoarders where we go into (25:28 - 25:32)
steve's bank and we just start deleting (25:29 - 25:35)
things you do not need this pokemon you (25:32 - 25:37)
do not play spark joy (25:35 - 25:39)
this you don't see what's in my bag you (25:37 - 25:41)
start bidding and then we cut the lock (25:39 - 25:43)
open (25:41 - 25:46)
and then you get garbage um (25:43 - 25:49)
it is so hard after what two years now i (25:46 - 25:51)
think it's two years for pokemon home it (25:49 - 25:52)
is so hard to recommend pokemon home to (25:51 - 25:54)
a pokemon per like a fan (25:52 - 25:57)
like do you have more than a thousand (25:54 - 26:01)
pokemon no don't get this (25:57 - 26:01)
like the only reason why i'm still (26:01 - 26:04)
paying for it (26:03 - 26:07)
is because i forget when it charges (26:04 - 26:08)
again (26:07 - 26:10)
and then it says hey it charged like two (26:08 - 26:11)
weeks ago right you bought it yeah (26:10 - 26:13)
pokemon home again yeah (26:11 - 26:17)
dang it but you get that mageirana (26:13 - 26:19)
i mean if you have all the pokemon on (26:17 - 26:21)
christmas unlike somebody else i will (26:19 - 26:24)
say pokemon home has been updated more (26:21 - 26:26)
in the last two years than the (26:24 - 26:28)
seven plus years that pokemon bank (26:26 - 26:30)
existed (26:28 - 26:32)
but what do you need to bank nothing (26:30 - 26:34)
but i do think pokemon home is a better (26:32 - 26:36)
foundation going forward than bank ever (26:34 - 26:38)
was (26:36 - 26:40)
um and i think part of that is just (26:38 - 26:42)
because you can access your pokemon home (26:40 - 26:44)
on your your phone (26:42 - 26:47)
and (26:44 - 26:47)
i i i wish (26:47 - 26:52)
i wish it was a better app and i wish it (26:50 - 26:54)
was like easier to recommend but there's (26:52 - 26:55)
still (26:54 - 26:57)
there's still something about it where (26:55 - 26:58)
it just feels like they released it it's (26:57 - 27:00)
there and they have no desire to update (26:58 - 27:05)
it and that in itself also concerns me (27:00 - 27:07)
i mean i like it for the gts i do use (27:05 - 27:08)
the gta when i was trying to get my (27:07 - 27:10)
mcgear in it i'm like i'm not hunting (27:08 - 27:12)
all these things (27:10 - 27:15)
i am not looking for (27:12 - 27:17)
whatever middle evolution this is just (27:15 - 27:19)
somebody even even if you're like you (27:17 - 27:21)
like gts it's still hard to be like hey (27:19 - 27:23)
for 15 bucks you can (27:21 - 27:25)
gts trade (27:23 - 27:28)
three of them at a time (27:25 - 27:28)
i don't know less than two dollars a (27:29 - 27:31)
month (27:30 - 27:35)
i know it's not terribly expensive again (27:31 - 27:36)
coffee (27:35 - 27:40)
you can save your pokemon every day look (27:36 - 27:43)
i i'm not going back there (27:40 - 27:47)
i probably legit sign into home (27:43 - 27:50)
maybe twice a month and it's usually to (27:47 - 27:52)
look for one pokemon that i need for (27:50 - 27:53)
something (27:52 - 27:56)
i sign into home once a week because (27:53 - 27:58)
i've sent a bunch of things from go in (27:56 - 28:00)
there and i have to go in and accept (27:58 - 28:04)
them or it won't take more (28:00 - 28:04)
i've never sent anything from go to home (28:05 - 28:08)
i don't think (28:07 - 28:14)
maybe maybe oh i did little metal dudes (28:08 - 28:14)
now those went directly into pokemon (28:16 - 28:23)
let's go pikachu oh right (28:19 - 28:26)
i think you can do that (28:23 - 28:27)
yeah you can send them right to let's go (28:26 - 28:29)
pikachu go to that park (28:27 - 28:33)
yep uh okay well (28:29 - 28:33)
hey if you wait 13 months you won't have (28:35 - 28:39)
to pay five dollars (28:37 - 28:41)
i want to know what will's mad at us for (28:39 - 28:42)
okay (28:41 - 28:43)
so (28:42 - 28:45)
last week and (28:43 - 28:47)
i'll start out by saying the standard (28:45 - 28:49)
steve disclaimer if you didn't sign up (28:47 - 28:53)
for the competition it's too late (28:49 - 28:55)
but both of you guys were talking about (28:53 - 28:56)
because i was like where do i go to sign (28:55 - 28:58)
up because in black and white days you (28:56 - 29:00)
just have to go to the website to sign (28:58 - 29:01)
up but no you're like oh you just do it (29:00 - 29:03)
through pokemon source i made it to talk (29:01 - 29:05)
about it you go to i don't i don't have (29:03 - 29:07)
a tick tock you go to the vs menu and (29:05 - 29:09)
then both of you were like (29:07 - 29:12)
there's the the battle stadium on the (29:09 - 29:14)
left and then there's this other thing (29:12 - 29:16)
which i've never used and i have no idea (29:14 - 29:18)
what it's for this bizarre (29:16 - 29:20)
y'all (29:18 - 29:23)
the other one is for when you go (29:20 - 29:29)
physically yes to a vgc competition in (29:23 - 29:30)
person (29:29 - 29:32)
so that you can connect download (29:30 - 29:34)
whatever rules they have set for that (29:32 - 29:36)
competition no but steve was agreeing (29:34 - 29:39)
with you greg it's it's also a spectator (29:36 - 29:41)
mode never (29:39 - 29:44)
been there so you can you can you can be (29:41 - 29:45)
mad (29:44 - 29:47)
he was agreeing with you he's like the (29:45 - 29:48)
other (29:47 - 29:50)
he's like i know what it is and i'm like (29:48 - 29:53)
this is the most standard thing (29:50 - 29:55)
99 of pokemon fans will never need to (29:53 - 29:58)
hit that button well i i had no idea (29:55 - 30:00)
what it was that was your chance to (29:58 - 30:03)
educate me i had never been there and i (30:00 - 30:05)
was like oh this is so obvious and then (30:03 - 30:07)
you got there and you were like this is (30:05 - 30:08)
useless (30:07 - 30:11)
no it's not because i not only (30:08 - 30:12)
have i (30:11 - 30:15)
gone to multiple in-person local shop (30:12 - 30:17)
vgc competitions (30:15 - 30:20)
my pokemon league i used to go to in dc (30:17 - 30:22)
was vgc not tcg (30:20 - 30:25)
and they would distribute the the weekly (30:22 - 30:27)
tournament rules that way (30:25 - 30:29)
uh so did you sign up (30:27 - 30:32)
yes i signed up oh i'm competitive now (30:29 - 30:34)
are we going to talk about it because (30:32 - 30:36)
i'm i'm i'm the new competitor now yeah (30:34 - 30:38)
we can uh (30:36 - 30:41)
we can talk about the the ic before (30:38 - 30:42)
break here (30:41 - 30:45)
um i won (30:42 - 30:48)
three out of my four matches why did i (30:45 - 30:50)
do four you might ask because i clicked (30:48 - 30:53)
the wrong button and i couldn't back out (30:50 - 30:54)
oh dang (30:53 - 30:56)
but i want to see that three out of four (30:54 - 30:58)
i i (30:56 - 31:01)
seventy i'm not i when i get challenged (30:58 - 31:03)
i am not conceding (31:01 - 31:04)
okay (31:03 - 31:07)
i am going to fight and win and i did (31:04 - 31:08)
an actual look i'm not trying to be (31:07 - 31:11)
sarcastic here or bring you down (31:08 - 31:14)
uh you are right by by with that to (31:11 - 31:16)
claim disclaimer you are definitely (31:14 - 31:18)
going to try to do that yup yup do (31:16 - 31:21)
do your three wins (31:18 - 31:23)
they didn't make you want to keep (31:21 - 31:24)
playing (31:23 - 31:28)
no pvp is awful (31:24 - 31:28)
i thought like you being like i won (31:28 - 31:33)
three out of four matches it was (31:30 - 31:36)
exciting i it now wants me to i want to (31:33 - 31:39)
keep playing no i i am (31:36 - 31:40)
so my (31:39 - 31:43)
superiority is set in stone (31:40 - 31:46)
there is no way that i want i've i've (31:43 - 31:48)
proven myself i do not need to (31:46 - 31:50)
continually prove myself unlike some (31:48 - 31:53)
other people on this podcast steve who (31:50 - 31:55)
are like i must show that i am the best (31:53 - 31:57)
at all times no i already did (31:55 - 31:59)
i got a great record if that was a (31:57 - 32:01)
batting average i would have people (31:59 - 32:03)
banging down my doors to be like come (32:01 - 32:05)
play for us you're so why would they (32:03 - 32:07)
look at the your record when they would (32:05 - 32:10)
look at your elo (32:07 - 32:10)
you have a [ __ ] like orchestra (32:10 - 32:15)
oh (32:13 - 32:17)
that's all that matters is the elo yeah (32:15 - 32:18)
it's only the elo (32:17 - 32:20)
this is how you can tell greg is (32:18 - 32:21)
certainly not competitive because he (32:20 - 32:23)
doesn't even know what the elo is i (32:21 - 32:25)
don't know what the yellow is i know elo (32:23 - 32:26)
is electric light orchestra and there (32:25 - 32:30)
are uh interesting band from a long time (32:26 - 32:31)
ago (32:30 - 32:33)
i actually am a big fan of the electric (32:31 - 32:35)
light orchestra what is elo (32:33 - 32:36)
it is a (32:35 - 32:40)
way of ranking people who are competing (32:36 - 32:42)
based on the number of wins versus (32:40 - 32:45)
losses but also taking into account like (32:42 - 32:47)
the number of wins and losses of the (32:45 - 32:50)
people that they fought against (32:47 - 32:52)
so for example everyone in pokemon (32:50 - 32:54)
starts at 1500 elo (32:52 - 32:57)
so if you you're talking about the rank (32:54 - 32:59)
yeah yeah well that's the your ranking (32:57 - 33:01)
is a little bit different (32:59 - 33:02)
because like when i ended the tournament (33:01 - 33:05)
i was ranked like 3 000 in the world i (33:02 - 33:06)
don't know how many people there were (33:05 - 33:07)
playing (33:06 - 33:09)
but my elo at the very end of the (33:07 - 33:12)
tournament was like 16-18 (33:09 - 33:15)
so if if if we both played a game and it (33:12 - 33:17)
was our first match we'd both be at 1500 (33:15 - 33:19)
and if you were to win your elo would (33:17 - 33:22)
probably go to like 15 11 and then my (33:19 - 33:23)
elo would go to like (33:22 - 33:27)
nine fourteen eighty nine (33:23 - 33:28)
and so then i would be more likely to be (33:27 - 33:31)
matched with somebody around my elo and (33:28 - 33:32)
you'd be more likely to be matched (33:31 - 33:34)
around somebody but because there are (33:32 - 33:36)
because the pokemon system is kinda bad (33:34 - 33:38)
and because there were so many players (33:36 - 33:40)
sometimes you would get super up paired (33:38 - 33:42)
or super down paired so when i was like (33:40 - 33:44)
1580 i got matched with somebody at 1 (33:42 - 33:47)
500. which is like to me is very obvious (33:44 - 33:48)
that if if i'm getting matched with (33:47 - 33:50)
somebody's 1500 it is literally their (33:48 - 33:53)
first game in the tournament um my one (33:50 - 33:56)
loss was somebody who's at 15.99 so (33:53 - 33:58)
oh yeah so you got super super up paired (33:56 - 34:00)
yeah so 15 like if if they're close to (33:58 - 34:03)
1600 after 1600 you like barely get (34:00 - 34:05)
matched with like you you stop getting (34:03 - 34:06)
like the (34:05 - 34:08)
story teams (34:06 - 34:10)
like i thought somebody who was like (34:08 - 34:12)
they had like intellion (34:10 - 34:15)
corbin like the very standard typical (34:12 - 34:18)
like oh you caught all these pokemon (34:15 - 34:20)
and you beat leon with this team which (34:18 - 34:21)
is like hey that's like an (34:20 - 34:23)
accomplishment you beat leon hey lien (34:21 - 34:25)
was the undefeated champion so it's (34:23 - 34:28)
nothing to sneeze at (34:25 - 34:28)
um so yeah the the elo (34:28 - 34:33)
there's there's like three numbers (34:31 - 34:34)
there's your win loss ratio and then (34:33 - 34:36)
there's the elo and then there's your (34:34 - 34:39)
like global ranking so then at the very (34:36 - 34:41)
end of the tournament it will give you (34:39 - 34:43)
your elo and then it will give you your (34:41 - 34:44)
global ranking it'll say like hey you (34:43 - 34:47)
place like 8 000 in the world and then (34:44 - 34:48)
you'll be able to like redeem rewards (34:47 - 34:51)
which is what you'll get the the bird (34:48 - 34:52)
from but (34:51 - 34:53)
i mean the main thing about to (34:52 - 34:55)
understand about elo i think a lot of (34:53 - 34:56)
people miss is (34:55 - 34:59)
if you lose to somebody who has been (34:56 - 35:02)
losing it hits you a lot harder in your (34:59 - 35:04)
elo than (35:02 - 35:05)
if you like (35:04 - 35:06)
win (35:05 - 35:08)
against somebody who's been losing like (35:06 - 35:10)
you you the amount that you move really (35:08 - 35:13)
depends on who you just battled and (35:10 - 35:15)
how well they were doing as well yeah (35:13 - 35:17)
so if you were if you were 1500 elo and (35:15 - 35:19)
you played somebody that was 1590 and (35:17 - 35:21)
you lost you wouldn't lose that many (35:19 - 35:22)
points (35:21 - 35:24)
yeah but if you were 1500 and you beat (35:22 - 35:27)
somebody who was 1590 you would go you'd (35:24 - 35:29)
get a good amount of credit for that (35:27 - 35:31)
yeah (35:29 - 35:32)
uh the other thing you know i did want (35:31 - 35:34)
to bring this up before we take a break (35:32 - 35:35)
of (35:34 - 35:37)
i i have (35:35 - 35:40)
grossly underestimated oh there's the (35:37 - 35:42)
statement of the year (35:40 - 35:44)
stop right there that's all you have to (35:42 - 35:45)
say (35:44 - 35:48)
we agree with the song everything (35:45 - 35:51)
we'll see you guys next week (35:48 - 35:54)
i have grossly underestimated (35:51 - 35:55)
how (35:54 - 35:59)
difficult it is for somebody to get into (35:55 - 36:00)
competitive (35:59 - 36:03)
not necessarily like playing it (36:00 - 36:05)
or like learning it (36:03 - 36:09)
like building a team (36:05 - 36:09)
and so my friend who plays a ton of (36:09 - 36:16)
pokemon right like thousand hours in (36:14 - 36:18)
sword and shield has played like the (36:16 - 36:19)
heart gold soul silver the omega ruby (36:18 - 36:21)
alpha sapphire the sun like they played (36:19 - 36:23)
it all right probably a thousand hours (36:21 - 36:26)
in each game they liked a shiny hunt (36:23 - 36:27)
they're like i want to get the shiny (36:26 - 36:29)
bird everyone wants to get the shiny (36:27 - 36:31)
bird they did they had the epiphany that (36:29 - 36:32)
i had (36:31 - 36:34)
back in ultra is that the right word (36:32 - 36:36)
epiphany ultra sun ultra moon where it's (36:34 - 36:38)
like i'm assuming (36:36 - 36:39)
if (36:38 - 36:40)
you're going to make me compete to get (36:39 - 36:43)
tapu bulu and tapu finney and tapu lele (36:40 - 36:46)
then i want to try to build a team (36:43 - 36:48)
i'm going to look up teams i mean i want (36:46 - 36:50)
to buy something other than an epiphany (36:48 - 36:51)
that's not an epiphany it's something (36:50 - 36:53)
good that's that's uh i want to punish (36:51 - 36:56)
myself i could take that the foolish (36:53 - 36:58)
notion or i could decide that i want to (36:56 - 37:00)
try to enter into this scene (36:58 - 37:02)
yeah so in an ultrasound ultra moon i (37:00 - 37:04)
was like i want if i'm going to compete (37:02 - 37:05)
for top if i'm going to do three matches (37:04 - 37:07)
to get a top of boolea i want to try to (37:05 - 37:09)
at least win the three matches right (37:07 - 37:12)
so let me get the incineroar let me get (37:09 - 37:14)
the palkia let me get the whatever else (37:12 - 37:17)
you were using in sun and moon (37:14 - 37:18)
and so my friend had the same thing (37:17 - 37:19)
they're like well if (37:18 - 37:20)
if (37:19 - 37:23)
i need to do nine matches total (37:20 - 37:25)
three this month three next month three (37:23 - 37:27)
the next month why don't i just build a (37:25 - 37:30)
team that i can that is competitive (37:27 - 37:32)
enough where i can at least try to have (37:30 - 37:35)
fun i can try to win i can try to like (37:32 - 37:37)
get into this (37:35 - 37:39)
and i'll put the work in now so i have a (37:37 - 37:40)
team for all three tournaments that (37:39 - 37:42)
makes sense right that's like a very (37:40 - 37:44)
logical like if i'm going to get into (37:42 - 37:46)
pokemon these three tournaments have the (37:44 - 37:48)
same rules they have all rewards i want (37:46 - 37:51)
to do maybe i'll try (37:48 - 37:53)
see that's that (37:51 - 37:56)
that is the that is your generation's (37:53 - 37:58)
problem is you have the thought (37:56 - 38:00)
maybe i'll try well you need to be like (37:58 - 38:04)
us whereas like trying only begets pain (38:00 - 38:06)
yes so it's it's it's actually it's (38:04 - 38:09)
classic zoomer right oh close (38:06 - 38:11)
baby boomers anything that's worth doing (38:09 - 38:13)
is worth doing well (38:11 - 38:15)
millennials anything that's worth doing (38:13 - 38:18)
is worth doing well wrong gen x (38:15 - 38:20)
why would you do anything why would you (38:18 - 38:23)
don't bother doing it's called pointless (38:20 - 38:25)
why are you trying you're gonna get your (38:23 - 38:28)
heart crushed so just lie down and sleep (38:25 - 38:30)
it that's what the end result's gonna be (38:28 - 38:34)
anyways yes so they they came to me and (38:30 - 38:37)
they were like (38:34 - 38:37)
i i hate competitive because i can't use (38:37 - 38:40)
my favorite pokemon (38:39 - 38:42)
i was like i understand i learned that (38:40 - 38:45)
lesson early on yeah and i was like tell (38:42 - 38:48)
me what tell me like three of your (38:45 - 38:50)
favorite pokemon we can put one on a (38:48 - 38:51)
team (38:50 - 38:53)
it might not be the best but i but like (38:51 - 38:56)
we have to use like two legends we have (38:53 - 38:57)
to use a restrict we have to use (38:56 - 38:59)
restricted we can maybe use one or two (38:57 - 39:02)
of your favorite pokemon and then like (38:59 - 39:04)
maybe name some other pokemon and we can (39:02 - 39:06)
kind of make it work right and that's (39:04 - 39:07)
the thing about competitive you can make (39:06 - 39:10)
any team technically work it just might (39:07 - 39:13)
not be good also there is r (39:10 - 39:15)
also there is rng in pokemon right like (39:13 - 39:18)
you can you can still have a bad team (39:15 - 39:20)
and win that's the difference between a (39:18 - 39:23)
game like pokemon and a game like chess (39:20 - 39:26)
somebody who is brand new to pokemon can (39:23 - 39:28)
still beat the world's best they could (39:26 - 39:30)
still beat a wolf glick (39:28 - 39:33)
because of thunder wave because of burn (39:30 - 39:34)
because of misses because of critical (39:33 - 39:37)
hits if you're brand new to chess you (39:34 - 39:39)
cannot beat (39:37 - 39:40)
gustav (39:39 - 39:42)
whoever the best chess player is i think (39:40 - 39:44)
his actual name is gustav uh (39:42 - 39:46)
you can't whoever that's how important (39:44 - 39:48)
you care about jazz you you just cannot (39:46 - 39:51)
beat them right there is no rng or luck (39:48 - 39:53)
in chess there is only (39:51 - 39:54)
skill (39:53 - 39:56)
but pokemon has a huge amount of there's (39:54 - 39:58)
like that tiny tiny percentage that (39:56 - 40:00)
you're bumbling (39:58 - 40:02)
actually does (40:00 - 40:05)
like the smallest curve (40:02 - 40:07)
chess player in the world is magnus (40:05 - 40:11)
carlson oh (40:07 - 40:11)
um (40:13 - 40:17)
so they said their favorite pokemon they (40:14 - 40:19)
were like i really like leafeon (40:17 - 40:21)
and i was like okay (40:19 - 40:24)
well leafeon works in sun we can use (40:21 - 40:26)
groudon that's number one restricted so (40:24 - 40:29)
if you want leafeon we gotta use groudon (40:26 - 40:31)
and they're like okay and i was like our (40:29 - 40:33)
other restrictive's gonna be zashian (40:31 - 40:35)
because zash there's no reason not to (40:33 - 40:37)
use ashi and it is the best competitive (40:35 - 40:38)
pokemon (40:37 - 40:40)
this is barrier number one that i didn't (40:38 - 40:41)
even think of (40:40 - 40:43)
they tell me (40:41 - 40:47)
i've only played pokemon shield (40:43 - 40:47)
i have zamasunta (40:47 - 40:51)
oh okay yeah it did i didn't know did (40:51 - 40:56)
you get a shiny one for free (40:54 - 40:59)
you just said they were a shiny hunter (40:56 - 41:00)
yeah (40:59 - 41:01)
uh (41:00 - 41:04)
you know you know how bobby probably is (41:01 - 41:05)
listening to this podcast right now and (41:04 - 41:08)
forgot to do their three matches yes (41:05 - 41:10)
there you go (41:08 - 41:12)
yeah (41:10 - 41:14)
they well they enjoy the hunt not (41:12 - 41:18)
necessarily just being handed a shiny oh (41:14 - 41:19)
the hunt of having to go to gamestop to (41:18 - 41:21)
pick up those codes is way worse than (41:19 - 41:25)
shiny hunting alone in your house (41:21 - 41:27)
so like that is a barrier in itself (41:25 - 41:29)
right like oh i played the wrong game (41:27 - 41:32)
like one game has the most dominant (41:29 - 41:34)
pokemon in competitive format (41:32 - 41:36)
so i was like hey don't worry i sped run (41:34 - 41:38)
pokemon sword four times i got four (41:36 - 41:39)
zashian's (41:38 - 41:41)
disappointments down the line for them (41:39 - 41:43)
though (41:41 - 41:43)
because i mean they're lucky to know you (41:43 - 41:47)
number one but guess what (41:45 - 41:50)
i got the shiny zaussian (41:47 - 41:53)
and i didn't pay attention to its nature (41:50 - 41:55)
so i think i was adamant (41:53 - 41:57)
whatever but you can like with so many (41:55 - 41:59)
of these ones you could get the wrong (41:57 - 42:01)
one that's true so i was like okay i was (41:59 - 42:03)
like okay it's like okay cool (42:01 - 42:05)
i'll i got zashi and i'll let you borrow (42:03 - 42:07)
zashian (42:05 - 42:09)
i was like (42:07 - 42:12)
barrier number two they were like i (42:09 - 42:15)
don't have a groudon (42:12 - 42:17)
and i was like what (42:15 - 42:20)
did did did you not play omega ruby (42:17 - 42:21)
alpha sapphire not after steve (42:20 - 42:23)
complained about those games for so yeah (42:21 - 42:27)
they were like i played alpha sapphire (42:23 - 42:29)
did you not do dynamics adventure in (42:27 - 42:31)
sword and shield (42:29 - 42:33)
i did like yes they did but they they (42:31 - 42:34)
didn't (42:33 - 42:37)
they were shiny hunting the legends in (42:34 - 42:38)
sword and shield so they didn't catch (42:37 - 42:40)
the legends (42:38 - 42:41)
and they were like i'm gonna i'm gonna (42:40 - 42:43)
try to find a dynomax adventure for (42:41 - 42:44)
groudon (42:43 - 42:46)
spent three four hours they couldn't get (42:44 - 42:49)
the groudon dynomax adventure (42:46 - 42:51)
which i understand is like (42:49 - 42:53)
rng at that point (42:51 - 42:55)
but man if you're trying to prepare for (42:53 - 42:56)
a tournament (42:55 - 42:57)
and all of a sudden you're doing three (42:56 - 42:59)
to four hours of unprepared dynamics (42:57 - 43:02)
adventure by yourself (42:59 - 43:03)
and the way that you got had the wrong (43:02 - 43:06)
nature (43:03 - 43:07)
that (43:06 - 43:10)
really sucks the the fun out of it so i (43:07 - 43:11)
was like you didn't you didn't get catch (43:10 - 43:13)
groudon pokemon go they're like no i (43:11 - 43:15)
have no one to raid with i was like okay (43:13 - 43:16)
i did catch a bunch of groudons of (43:15 - 43:18)
pokemon go let me move the groudon from (43:16 - 43:21)
pokemon go and you can now borrow one of (43:18 - 43:23)
my groudon (43:21 - 43:25)
and they were like i have a shiny litten (43:23 - 43:27)
that i bred i was like oh perfect does (43:25 - 43:29)
it have the hidden ability no it has (43:27 - 43:30)
blaze (43:29 - 43:31)
i was like okay (43:30 - 43:32)
um (43:31 - 43:34)
so you need the special hidden ability (43:32 - 43:36)
capsule to change its ability and (43:34 - 43:37)
they're like okay (43:36 - 43:39)
so they went to the battle tower they (43:37 - 43:40)
bought the hidden ability they bought (43:39 - 43:44)
the ability capsule and they s it it (43:40 - 43:45)
doesn't work (43:44 - 43:47)
and they were like i bought i'm out of (43:45 - 43:48)
battle points because i bought some of (43:47 - 43:50)
these and they didn't work and now i (43:48 - 43:53)
like i can't change litten's ability and (43:50 - 43:54)
i was like (43:53 - 43:55)
oh you have to go to the crown tundra (43:54 - 43:58)
and the lady inside the crown tundra (43:55 - 44:00)
sends sells you the hidden ability one (43:58 - 44:02)
it's 200. they have enough of that (44:00 - 44:04)
because they just spent three hours (44:02 - 44:05)
doing groudon raids to find a crowd on (44:04 - 44:06)
so at least they have enough currency (44:05 - 44:08)
there but they were like how am i (44:06 - 44:10)
supposed to know this the game never (44:08 - 44:12)
tells me that there's a and i was like (44:10 - 44:14)
you know i never thought of that you're (44:12 - 44:16)
a you're a million percent right like (44:14 - 44:19)
the game never tells you for our audio (44:16 - 44:20)
listeners greg and will are just (44:19 - 44:22)
hardcore shaking their head the game (44:20 - 44:24)
never even said before the game doesn't (44:22 - 44:25)
tell you a lot of things it's supposed (44:24 - 44:27)
to be the thrill of just but it makes (44:25 - 44:29)
sense if i'm telling if i'm helping a (44:27 - 44:30)
person to get into competitive and like (44:29 - 44:32)
i'm not available and they're like okay (44:30 - 44:34)
i want to learn this on my own and they (44:32 - 44:36)
go to what place makes the most sense (44:34 - 44:39)
the battle tower and the battle tower (44:36 - 44:41)
doesn't have the items they're offering (44:39 - 44:43)
why would they think to go to the cave (44:41 - 44:45)
in the crown tundra to be like i need (44:43 - 44:46)
this one specific battle item i (44:45 - 44:48)
understand that it was introduced but (44:46 - 44:50)
again for people (44:48 - 44:51)
for like there's probably like four (44:50 - 44:52)
people seeing the show right now and (44:51 - 44:53)
they'll be like they should have googled (44:52 - 44:54)
it or they should have looked it up or (44:53 - 44:55)
they should have known better it's like (44:54 - 44:57)
no these people are like (44:55 - 45:00)
like trying to get into this game trying (44:57 - 45:03)
to like learn competitive that's also an (45:00 - 45:05)
incredibly poor argument because right (45:03 - 45:07)
you have to even know that something (45:05 - 45:10)
could possibly exist today to look for (45:07 - 45:11)
it and it's like i would never have (45:10 - 45:13)
thought that there might be something (45:11 - 45:15)
out there that could change my pokemon's (45:13 - 45:17)
ability (45:15 - 45:19)
and i was like oh and i was like okay (45:17 - 45:20)
all right we got we got the pokemon (45:19 - 45:23)
right we got we got all six now i was (45:20 - 45:24)
like i'm letting you borrow my groudon (45:23 - 45:27)
i'm letting you borrow my zashian (45:24 - 45:29)
i was like okay so (45:27 - 45:31)
we need to i was like i know you have (45:29 - 45:33)
enough candy to get these all pokemon to (45:31 - 45:34)
level 100 perfect they had that they had (45:33 - 45:36)
all the candy they were able to get them (45:34 - 45:38)
to 100 that part was easy (45:36 - 45:39)
i was like okay you're going to go to (45:38 - 45:41)
the isle of armor there's vending (45:39 - 45:43)
machines in the back you're going to buy (45:41 - 45:45)
a bunch of vitamins i'll tell you where (45:43 - 45:47)
to put those vitamins they were like i (45:45 - 45:48)
don't have any money (45:47 - 45:50)
i was like what do you mean not have any (45:48 - 45:51)
money they were like well the last thing (45:50 - 45:53)
i did in pokemon shield was i bought all (45:51 - 45:55)
the clothes i could because i really (45:53 - 45:57)
like the clothes (45:55 - 45:57)
i was like you know that's you know (45:58 - 46:01)
that's a vet it's very valid honestly (45:59 - 46:05)
the game has great clothes i understand (46:01 - 46:08)
100 that was a good use of in-game (46:05 - 46:10)
currency (46:08 - 46:10)
i was like well the tournament has (46:12 - 46:16)
already started (46:14 - 46:17)
uh so you could evie train the (46:16 - 46:19)
old-fashioned way but because you've (46:17 - 46:21)
never gotten into competitive i'm gonna (46:19 - 46:23)
go on a whim being like um (46:21 - 46:26)
eevee training the old-fashioned way (46:23 - 46:27)
probably not the best for you i was like (46:26 - 46:30)
just send the pokemon back i got enough (46:27 - 46:32)
vitamins and money i can (46:30 - 46:34)
just vitamin em up (46:32 - 46:35)
the game doesn't tell you about the (46:34 - 46:37)
battle ready mark (46:35 - 46:39)
which (46:37 - 46:41)
i had to do it for like their litten was (46:39 - 46:43)
originally they shiny hunted it in sun (46:41 - 46:45)
and moon i think (46:43 - 46:47)
so battle ready mark (46:45 - 46:50)
and the other thing is egg moves (46:47 - 46:51)
they were like i went to the move (46:50 - 46:54)
relearner for incineroar i can't get (46:51 - 46:55)
parting shot (46:54 - 46:58)
and i i looked ever i like i looked up (46:55 - 47:00)
all the tms in the game and there's no (46:58 - 47:01)
tm for parting shot (47:00 - 47:03)
and i was like oh parting shots an egg (47:01 - 47:05)
move and they're like well how do i get (47:03 - 47:07)
parting shot and i was like well you (47:05 - 47:08)
need (47:07 - 47:10)
you like literally need another (47:08 - 47:11)
incineroar with parting shot and then (47:10 - 47:13)
you need to put them but like like it (47:11 - 47:17)
was it was one hurdle after another (47:13 - 47:21)
to get this person like just six pokemon (47:17 - 47:22)
like to use and like they just they (47:21 - 47:25)
really wanted to use leafeon i thought (47:22 - 47:27)
groudon was a good pairing i paired like (47:25 - 47:29)
uh some other pokemon that they had they (47:27 - 47:30)
were like i have a shiny gastrodon i was (47:29 - 47:32)
like great gastrodon's great (47:30 - 47:34)
competitively let's do that (47:32 - 47:36)
um (47:34 - 47:38)
and at the end of it i could sense the (47:36 - 47:40)
frustration of like i don't even want to (47:38 - 47:43)
do this anymore yep yep and i was like i (47:40 - 47:45)
was like you haven't even started (47:43 - 47:47)
battling yet right like that and that's (47:45 - 47:49)
another way frustration frustrating part (47:47 - 47:51)
so there are two conclusions that we can (47:49 - 47:53)
get from this entire story two very (47:51 - 47:56)
simple conclusions number one omega ruby (47:53 - 47:58)
alpha sapphire was the best game (47:56 - 48:01)
for competitive breeding and getting (47:58 - 48:03)
because you had not only did you have (48:01 - 48:05)
hordes for your evs and ivs but that (48:03 - 48:07)
little island made it so easy to breed (48:05 - 48:09)
and breed and breed until you need which (48:07 - 48:10)
number one that was that but that's not (48:09 - 48:12)
the problem (48:10 - 48:13)
you told your story number two (48:12 - 48:15)
[Laughter] (48:13 - 48:17)
every time (48:15 - 48:20)
that you have said in the past year two (48:17 - 48:22)
year whatever (48:20 - 48:24)
this decision by the pokemon company (48:22 - 48:26)
this game from this pokemon game does (48:24 - 48:28)
nothing for competitive it's hostile for (48:26 - 48:30)
competitive it's useless for (48:28 - 48:33)
every pokemon game has been hostile and (48:30 - 48:35)
useless for a competitive though so i (48:33 - 48:38)
finally come to this realist bullony you (48:35 - 48:40)
know here's the sword and shield when (48:38 - 48:42)
you just told that story for sword and (48:40 - 48:43)
shield here's the thing though like (48:42 - 48:46)
sword and shield like i have 20 of every (48:43 - 48:48)
mint and the reason i have 20 of every (48:46 - 48:50)
minute congratulations because there's (48:48 - 48:52)
an island in the isle of armor that you (48:50 - 48:54)
should go to every day and you can get (48:52 - 48:56)
like four free mints i have been playing (48:54 - 48:58)
this game for three years now i have no (48:56 - 49:00)
idea what a mint does (48:58 - 49:03)
i'm sure mints are great i i also (49:00 - 49:04)
noticed (49:03 - 49:09)
i could grow mints in legends arceus (49:04 - 49:09)
yeah why i have no clue why i guess but (49:09 - 49:13)
what uh (49:11 - 49:15)
why they put x attack in arceus either (49:13 - 49:19)
is is uh is that whatever the (49:15 - 49:21)
there are (49:19 - 49:23)
enough tools in the isle of armor to get (49:21 - 49:26)
you ready for competitive if you like (49:23 - 49:27)
explored the isle of armor every day (49:26 - 49:30)
which not a lot of people did (49:27 - 49:32)
um and what you brought up will of like (49:30 - 49:33)
oh omega ruby alpha sapphire is great (49:32 - 49:35)
for breeding and everything i think what (49:33 - 49:36)
makes sword and shield so great is you (49:35 - 49:39)
can ignore all of that right like they (49:36 - 49:42)
took a litten from sun and moon they got (49:39 - 49:44)
it to level 100 instantly they can just (49:42 - 49:46)
go to the battle tower bottle cap the (49:44 - 49:48)
stats that need to be bottle capped (49:46 - 49:50)
which means for those that not (49:48 - 49:53)
competitive it takes a bad iv stat and (49:50 - 49:55)
maxes that iv stat so you don't have to (49:53 - 49:57)
breed for perfect ivs and then you walk (49:55 - 50:00)
across the the room in the battle tower (49:57 - 50:02)
and you buy the correct mint so (50:00 - 50:04)
incineroar would probably need (50:02 - 50:05)
careful (50:04 - 50:07)
uh which is like minus special attack (50:05 - 50:09)
plus special defense (50:07 - 50:12)
and now now you have a perfect iv (50:09 - 50:14)
perfect nature incineroar ready for (50:12 - 50:16)
battle (50:14 - 50:18)
and then you gotta go to the cave to get (50:16 - 50:20)
the hidden ability (50:18 - 50:23)
so you can you can do all of that (50:20 - 50:25)
without breeding which i think is great (50:23 - 50:27)
and i think sword and shield is also (50:25 - 50:29)
great because if you're like i need a i (50:27 - 50:31)
need a good iv durant (50:29 - 50:34)
i can do a dynamax raid (50:31 - 50:36)
catch a do a five star durant raid catch (50:34 - 50:39)
a four iv durant with probably hidden (50:36 - 50:40)
ability (50:39 - 50:42)
and i'm good to go like there are a (50:40 - 50:44)
bunch of options in sword and shield to (50:42 - 50:48)
change existing pokemon that you have (50:44 - 50:51)
specifically nature's or abilities (50:48 - 50:52)
and (50:51 - 50:54)
you can do all of that without breeding (50:52 - 50:57)
which i think breeding was a huge hurdle (50:54 - 50:59)
for a lot of competitive people like i (50:57 - 51:00)
don't want to ride your bike around an (50:59 - 51:01)
island and put a quarter on the little (51:00 - 51:03)
thing and you didn't even have to do (51:01 - 51:05)
anything (51:03 - 51:05)
yeah but like if if i went through the (51:07 - 51:11)
game and i found a shiny (51:09 - 51:14)
basis blizzy basis yup (51:11 - 51:15)
but blissey bases are irrelevant you (51:14 - 51:17)
have candy now blissey (51:15 - 51:18)
basically (51:17 - 51:21)
fun of battling and seeing blissey (51:18 - 51:24)
but but you also had a secret defined by (51:21 - 51:27)
candy where you had a set of blizzy (51:24 - 51:30)
bases you would just go to (51:27 - 51:32)
and within five minutes your pokemon was (51:30 - 51:34)
leveled up yeah i'm not saying blissey (51:32 - 51:37)
bases are bad but i am saying like what (51:34 - 51:38)
sword and shield has done for (51:37 - 51:41)
competitive has literally let you take (51:38 - 51:42)
any pokemon that you have just stumbled (51:41 - 51:45)
upon and caught and get it competitive (51:42 - 51:46)
right (51:45 - 51:48)
within like 10 minutes (51:46 - 51:50)
the way it always was you have to know (51:48 - 51:52)
that's what you want to do because you (51:50 - 51:54)
have to play those games in a very (51:52 - 51:57)
specific way and you have to know (51:54 - 51:59)
and stay on top of the things that the (51:57 - 52:03)
game doesn't tell you let let alone all (51:59 - 52:06)
of that biz which i agree it's (52:03 - 52:09)
remember my first u.s nationals i drove (52:06 - 52:11)
10 hours to indianapolis with a jank (52:09 - 52:12)
team because i didn't know about any of (52:11 - 52:14)
this stuff yeah (52:12 - 52:16)
not only but then beyond that you have (52:14 - 52:19)
to know the meta you have to know the (52:16 - 52:21)
current strategies (52:19 - 52:24)
being competitive and actually being (52:21 - 52:26)
competitive is an investment and a (52:24 - 52:28)
specialization (52:26 - 52:30)
it is not something that is easy for (52:28 - 52:34)
anyone to just jump into (52:30 - 52:37)
yeah and i've said this before like (52:34 - 52:39)
building a team and actually using the (52:37 - 52:44)
team are completely different skill sets (52:39 - 52:44)
i mean the other thing that they did i (52:44 - 52:47)
will give this is that you can do rental (52:46 - 52:49)
teams right so you can get into (52:47 - 52:50)
competitive without having to do all (52:49 - 52:52)
this to see if you like it the thing (52:50 - 52:55)
about this set is that you can't use a (52:52 - 52:56)
rental team yes you can't use rental (52:55 - 53:00)
teams for official tournaments so (52:56 - 53:03)
like the (53:00 - 53:05)
you have to know (53:03 - 53:08)
that you like competitive (53:05 - 53:09)
and (53:08 - 53:12)
nothing in the game (53:09 - 53:12)
as a solo game says hey let's see if you (53:13 - 53:17)
like competitive because it's all post (53:15 - 53:19)
game and it is (53:17 - 53:21)
a tangle of knowledge (53:19 - 53:24)
that the game isn't really willing to (53:21 - 53:27)
untangle for you inside the game you do (53:24 - 53:29)
have to go outside of the game to learn (53:27 - 53:32)
a lot of these things and i think that (53:29 - 53:34)
is (53:32 - 53:37)
a downside to the how competitive works (53:34 - 53:38)
um (53:37 - 53:40)
because they want to support it but (53:38 - 53:43)
nothing in the game really (53:40 - 53:45)
has explanations there's not even like (53:43 - 53:47)
an optional section where you can be (53:45 - 53:49)
like let me take a competitive tutorial (53:47 - 53:51)
that explains all these things inside (53:49 - 53:53)
the game there's not like an old man (53:51 - 53:56)
pointing you to a tv it is just figure (53:53 - 53:58)
it out the internet did so go there (53:56 - 54:00)
which i don't think (53:58 - 54:02)
is (54:00 - 54:05)
i think most games if they want you to (54:02 - 54:07)
do a thing (54:05 - 54:08)
should make it (54:07 - 54:10)
obvious in the game that you're playing (54:08 - 54:12)
i think when you have to be pulled out (54:10 - 54:14)
of it to look it up somewhere else but (54:12 - 54:15)
you're being pulled out of that game i (54:14 - 54:17)
will i will 100 (54:15 - 54:19)
concede (54:17 - 54:21)
because i was watching somebody stream (54:19 - 54:23)
on twitch they were playing a game and (54:21 - 54:25)
they couldn't figure something out and (54:23 - 54:27)
this is like (54:25 - 54:30)
i would even say for the past 15 20 (54:27 - 54:31)
years (54:30 - 54:34)
nobody makes manuals anymore games used (54:31 - 54:35)
to come (54:34 - 54:37)
with an instruction manual (54:35 - 54:41)
and that's all gone (54:37 - 54:41)
but (54:42 - 54:45)
this leads into my prediction for (54:43 - 54:47)
pokemon day that they will be announcing (54:45 - 54:51)
a battle focused app that will (54:47 - 54:53)
take care of all competitive battling (54:51 - 54:54)
and it will give you all the (54:53 - 54:56)
instructions on how to here's the (54:54 - 54:57)
question (54:56 - 55:00)
hat did your friend finally (54:57 - 55:01)
try it (55:00 - 55:04)
after all that have i don't think they (55:01 - 55:05)
have started battling but their team is (55:04 - 55:06)
ready (55:05 - 55:08)
well (55:06 - 55:11)
good luck which which like the very (55:08 - 55:14)
first night of the tournament it was it (55:11 - 55:16)
was definitely a lot of people (55:14 - 55:19)
that they here they are for you could (55:16 - 55:20)
tell they're here for their three (55:19 - 55:22)
matches like they brought that p dove (55:20 - 55:24)
they brought like maybe they brought (55:22 - 55:25)
like one legend (55:24 - 55:28)
um and like i i got away from that (55:25 - 55:30)
obviously as your elo goes up you you (55:28 - 55:32)
slowly start getting away from that but (55:30 - 55:33)
you know your first couple matches and (55:32 - 55:36)
then the second day it was like (55:33 - 55:37)
i guess because my ell was a little bit (55:36 - 55:39)
higher but i was hearing from other (55:37 - 55:41)
people in like my twitch chat of like (55:39 - 55:43)
oh those those people are gone now it is (55:41 - 55:45)
just like it is just tournament people (55:43 - 55:47)
oh i'm about to hop in because i haven't (55:45 - 55:50)
done my matches yet yeah i mean i i i (55:47 - 55:53)
i will say that i ran into one that was (55:50 - 55:54)
clearly a (55:53 - 55:56)
not competitive team that was clearly a (55:54 - 55:58)
play through team but otherwise there (55:56 - 55:59)
were people who had like strategies and (55:58 - 56:02)
stuff but yeah are also very new to (55:59 - 56:05)
battling (56:02 - 56:05)
yeah i i kind of wish the elo system was (56:06 - 56:13)
a bit better because i feel like if if (56:09 - 56:15)
you were matched with people of your (56:13 - 56:16)
skill set i don't know how it would do (56:15 - 56:18)
it though i it's almost like that it (56:16 - 56:20)
would it should like read like hey both (56:18 - 56:22)
of you guys are not using legends (56:20 - 56:24)
legendary pokemon let's pair you up (56:22 - 56:27)
together i mean most most pairing (56:24 - 56:30)
systems in most games are bad (56:27 - 56:31)
yeah like (56:30 - 56:34)
they just don't know how to pair people (56:31 - 56:36)
and it's just like well this is this has (56:34 - 56:38)
been a garbage experience from top to (56:36 - 56:39)
bottom (56:38 - 56:41)
but yeah i mean i felt bad like i i (56:39 - 56:43)
fought some like again i fought somebody (56:41 - 56:44)
who had like their story team they had (56:43 - 56:47)
like an italian and a gardevoir and uh (56:44 - 56:48)
copperaja (56:47 - 56:50)
and i'm sure they looked at my team and (56:48 - 56:53)
they were like oh zashian and palpatine (56:50 - 56:54)
and it's like (56:53 - 56:55)
this is (56:54 - 56:58)
oh the tournament like oh hey the news (56:55 - 57:00)
okay he's using zasia and palpatine so i (56:58 - 57:00)
know (57:00 - 57:02)
and i'm up against that (57:00 - 57:05)
but here's the other thing that (57:02 - 57:07)
one of the problems one of the reasons (57:05 - 57:08)
why i never wanted to get into (57:07 - 57:10)
competitive is because the ones that i (57:08 - 57:11)
like (57:10 - 57:13)
the pokemon that i enjoy (57:11 - 57:15)
very few make it into the meta yeah you (57:13 - 57:17)
got that right (57:15 - 57:19)
it is very much when you get a (57:17 - 57:21)
competitive it's like well (57:19 - 57:24)
pick new favorites because (57:21 - 57:25)
i think that's okay (57:24 - 57:27)
cause like you you fell in love with (57:25 - 57:29)
roselia because it was able to beat that (57:27 - 57:32)
kyogre right yeah in a pve (57:29 - 57:34)
yeah but if you if you were in a (57:32 - 57:35)
situation where you were kind of like (57:34 - 57:38)
forced to use like calorics or ragiella (57:35 - 57:40)
key and like you won like a tournament (57:38 - 57:42)
with that you would probably have like a (57:40 - 57:43)
different affinity to those pokemon (57:42 - 57:45)
because you want a tournament with those (57:43 - 57:47)
pokemon i mean i'm saying that this uh (57:45 - 57:50)
that is the very first barrier of entry (57:47 - 57:53)
is the things that i love (57:50 - 57:55)
i can't use here (57:53 - 57:58)
and there is a cognizant (57:55 - 58:00)
mental block that you have to get over (57:58 - 58:01)
to be like well i'm going to give these (58:00 - 58:04)
a shot and hope that this experience is (58:01 - 58:06)
fun enough that it changes my opinion (58:04 - 58:07)
about this (58:06 - 58:11)
yeah and that is not a guarantee by any (58:07 - 58:13)
stretch of the imagination i guess it (58:11 - 58:15)
helps for me where like very dominant (58:13 - 58:16)
pokemon like like i like incineroar a (58:15 - 58:18)
lot and incineroar is very good (58:16 - 58:20)
competitively so it's like okay every (58:18 - 58:21)
team i'm probably going to build is (58:20 - 58:23)
going to have incineroar and i like (58:21 - 58:25)
like grimsnar a lot and guess what (58:23 - 58:27)
grimstar was all so great competitively (58:25 - 58:28)
so like (58:27 - 58:31)
i get and i like gastrodon guess what (58:28 - 58:32)
gastrodon also really could (58:31 - 58:34)
competitively like pokemon that start (58:32 - 58:37)
with g (58:34 - 58:38)
but you're also a very competitive (58:37 - 58:40)
person (58:38 - 58:42)
where not everybody is driven by that (58:40 - 58:44)
same we can argue that i'm a very (58:42 - 58:46)
competitive person and i don't like (58:44 - 58:49)
pokemon competitors yeah no i i get why (58:46 - 58:50)
people don't like pokemon competitive (58:49 - 58:52)
yeah and i i played adventure martin you (58:50 - 58:56)
cheated me i remember that cheat you i (58:52 - 58:59)
i i set a trap i could not help that you (58:56 - 59:02)
activated my trap card wait are we are (58:59 - 59:05)
we switching to yu-gi-oh now no (59:02 - 59:08)
[Laughter] (59:05 - 59:11)
activating trap cards i had i had (59:08 - 59:12)
one (59:11 - 59:14)
one ploy to play to trick you all into (59:12 - 59:15)
thinking (59:14 - 59:19)
one way and it worked and i capitalized (59:15 - 59:21)
on my knowledge that is that is how you (59:19 - 59:23)
play greg is competitive we were (59:21 - 59:25)
supposed to go to break half an hour ago (59:23 - 59:27)
yeah i know i didn't think the (59:25 - 59:28)
competitive conversation would take 35 (59:27 - 59:30)
minutes all right let's take a quick (59:28 - 59:31)
break we just have a little bit of (59:30 - 59:34)
pokemon go news and a little bit of tcg (59:31 - 59:37)
news and then uh that is it for the show (59:34 - 59:39)
so we will be right back (59:37 - 59:43)
and we are back from our break (59:39 - 59:44)

i overall um (62:01 - 62:07)
i feel like they're not (62:05 - 62:09)
advertising or hyping this up as much as (62:07 - 62:11)
they did for the kanto tour (62:09 - 62:13)
i agree they're called jen wonders not (62:11 - 62:16)
gen tours (62:13 - 62:18)
yeah (62:16 - 62:22)
i mean just based off the success of the (62:18 - 62:25)
canto i would assume the kanto tour was (62:22 - 62:27)
incredibly successful (62:25 - 62:29)
uh to the point where people were very (62:27 - 62:30)
upset that you had to be level 40 to get (62:29 - 62:32)
a mew (62:30 - 62:34)
uh are they giving away something (62:32 - 62:35)

how (66:08 - 66:10)
isn't (66:11 - 66:15)
umbreon and esperan tied to day night (66:12 - 66:17)
cycle in (66:15 - 66:20)
the game (66:17 - 66:21)
yes (66:20 - 66:23)
so you have to evolve if you want espeon (66:21 - 66:25)
you'll have to evolve it before (66:23 - 66:27)
six (66:25 - 66:28)
umbreon (66:27 - 66:32)
after six after six okay (66:28 - 66:33)
although i'm sure there will be (66:32 - 66:36)
espionage raids that'd be my guess yeah (66:33 - 66:38)
but i have to complete that quest don't (66:36 - 66:39)
i yeah (66:38 - 66:41)
um (66:39 - 66:42)

j o r t and u for unknown (66:59 - 67:07)
it does not (67:04 - 67:08)
i'm guessing all those letters can be (67:07 - 67:10)
shiny it doesn't specifically say but it (67:08 - 67:13)
does say that (67:10 - 67:13)
the (67:13 - 67:15)
pokemon gonna be shiny so i'm gonna (67:14 - 67:18)
guess those bleach (67:15 - 67:18)

word are they trying to spell (67:21 - 67:25)

i have to look at these letters and i'm (67:52 - 67:56)

what is what is go tour (68:02 - 68:07)

they just left out the h they didn't (68:10 - 68:14)
spell johto (68:12 - 68:16)
but then you don't need a g for johto (68:14 - 68:19)
you don't need a u for johto either (68:16 - 68:21)
j (68:19 - 68:23)

add any of these letters in (68:44 - 68:47)
for the world championship or whatever (68:48 - 68:53)
in california they did like let's go (68:51 - 68:56)
pikachu as like the whole (68:53 - 68:57)
the whole thing (68:56 - 69:01)
look i i i don't work there (68:57 - 69:04)

saturday april 23rd will be a community (69:06 - 69:10)
saturday may 21st will be a community (69:08 - 69:11)
day (69:10 - 69:13)
um really great (69:11 - 69:15)
that they announce those early (69:13 - 69:16)
especially for people who might work (69:15 - 69:19)
weekends and need enough time to ask for (69:16 - 69:21)
time off (69:19 - 69:24)
uh (69:21 - 69:24)
i'm excited for johto tour (69:24 - 69:30)
i liked the canto tour a lot (69:26 - 69:30)
i thought it was very refreshing (69:32 - 69:36)
i thought (69:35 - 69:40)
it was a fun day last time (69:36 - 69:42)
i'm sure mall of america will be packed (69:40 - 69:43)
literally nowhere else to play because (69:42 - 69:46)
it's like four degrees outside (69:43 - 69:48)
so i have to leave early because i'm (69:46 - 69:50)
going after my anniversary dinner that (69:48 - 69:53)
night although (69:50 - 69:55)
i'll be better than the pizza (69:53 - 69:58)
i i would i would wager to bet that this (69:55 - 69:59)
is not going to be more popular than the (69:58 - 70:01)
canto tour so maybe not as busy who (69:59 - 70:03)
knows (70:01 - 70:04)
it will be busy (70:03 - 70:06)
there's a lot of people who just play go (70:04 - 70:07)
who go to the mall of america there's (70:06 - 70:08)
also a lot of people who go to the mall (70:07 - 70:11)
of america to shop (70:08 - 70:14)
yes those people are i don't know why (70:11 - 70:15)
everything there is like five dollars (70:14 - 70:16)
more expensive (70:15 - 70:17)
it's so (70:16 - 70:19)
like why would you like wait where's (70:17 - 70:21)
them there where else will you find a (70:19 - 70:25)
canada goose store um (70:21 - 70:25)
can i use it sold in a lot of places uh (70:25 - 70:30)
but i want to buy it from the canada (70:28 - 70:31)
goose store (70:30 - 70:34)
well then sure (70:31 - 70:37)
was kanto tour only one day (70:34 - 70:39)
yeah (70:37 - 70:39)
what was the one that was two (70:39 - 70:45)
go fast (70:42 - 70:45)
there was one and then the second day (70:48 - 70:54)
was three days go fest okay (70:50 - 70:55)
yeah (70:54 - 70:57)
uh last bit of news here is the pokemon (70:55 - 71:00)
tcg live is making its canadian debut in (70:57 - 71:02)
limited beta (71:00 - 71:04)
uh (71:02 - 71:07)
a new way to play the tcg is on the way (71:04 - 71:09)
uh pokemon tcg live will be available in (71:07 - 71:12)
canada starting on february 22nd this is (71:09 - 71:15)
just limited beta at noon (71:12 - 71:16)
uh the new digital version of the game (71:15 - 71:18)
lets fans compile an extensive card (71:16 - 71:20)
collection build powerful decks (71:18 - 71:22)
battlefronts and more players can add (71:20 - 71:24)
cards in into their collection in (71:22 - 71:25)
numerous ways including scanning code (71:24 - 71:28)
cards exchanging currency earned in-game (71:25 - 71:30)
for booster packs and participating in (71:28 - 71:33)
daily quests the pokemon tcg live will (71:30 - 71:35)
be free to play and will be available to (71:33 - 71:36)
canadian players (71:35 - 71:42)
via mobile devices pc and mac (71:36 - 71:42)
i would probably wager to bet if there's (71:43 - 71:47)
a pokemon day announcement it will be an (71:45 - 71:49)
actual release date for this app that (71:47 - 71:50)
was supposed to come out in september (71:49 - 71:53)
and it is now february (71:50 - 71:55)
although when (71:53 - 71:58)
canada got the unite beta it was still (71:55 - 72:00)
what like over a month (71:58 - 72:03)
before unite came out (72:00 - 72:03)
yeah i mean that's fine they gotta iron (72:04 - 72:08)
out the bugs (72:06 - 72:10)
let canada fall on that sword we don't (72:08 - 72:13)
have to i'm i'm now like getting worried (72:10 - 72:15)
because i have (72:13 - 72:19)
piles of piles of these code cards (72:15 - 72:21)
that (72:19 - 72:24)
i have to redeem some way or another (72:21 - 72:25)
and i still don't know the optimal way (72:24 - 72:28)
like i don't know if like (72:25 - 72:29)
do i (72:28 - 72:31)
redeem them in the (72:29 - 72:35)
ptco and then transfer them to ptcgl (72:31 - 72:38)
or do i wait till ptc gl to come out (72:35 - 72:41)
either way though once once it comes out (72:38 - 72:43)
they already said (72:41 - 72:46)
that it will migrate one way and then (72:43 - 72:48)
ptcgo is dead yep (72:46 - 72:49)
yeah (72:48 - 72:52)
so now that the beta is literally three (72:49 - 72:55)
days away here (72:52 - 72:55)
it's like i i need to open that up and i (72:55 - 73:00)
need to like make a decision (72:57 - 73:03)
uh there'll be some overlap time (73:00 - 73:05)
yeah but i don't want to be bobby i (73:03 - 73:07)
don't want to wait last minute and then (73:05 - 73:10)
like oh the episode (73:07 - 73:11)
yeah valid validation trust bobby (73:10 - 73:13)
doesn't sit on them codes (73:11 - 73:14)
like (73:13 - 73:16)
like i should i should just do it this (73:14 - 73:18)
week and that way if the app comes out (73:16 - 73:20)
in two weeks i'm good because then (73:18 - 73:22)
you'll be crying when you find out you (73:20 - 73:25)
could have scanned them directly into pc (73:22 - 73:27)
live (73:25 - 73:30)
and no you can scan them into pcg ptcg (73:27 - 73:34)
live i just don't know (73:30 - 73:34)
what the better like conversion currency (73:35 - 73:40)
is because i think if they have an faq (73:38 - 73:42)
about this i would just have to there's (73:40 - 73:43)
probably somebody who made a youtube (73:42 - 73:44)
video about this (73:43 - 73:46)
like packs you don't open will get (73:44 - 73:49)
converted into like gems or something (73:46 - 73:51)
but if you leave like (73:49 - 73:54)
200 packs unopened that's better but (73:51 - 73:56)
then if you have other packs you should (73:54 - 73:58)
open them before the merger (73:56 - 74:01)
and then you should like trade which you (73:58 - 74:03)
don't have (74:01 - 74:04)
you should like trade (74:03 - 74:06)
because (74:04 - 74:07)
is (74:06 - 74:08)
overthink it (74:07 - 74:12)
continue to overthink it until it's moot (74:08 - 74:14)
because you can't do anything anymore (74:12 - 74:15)
that's yeah that is the best course of (74:14 - 74:17)
action i guess the like worst case (74:15 - 74:19)
scenario these cards aren't useless i (74:17 - 74:22)
can still redeem them it's just i might (74:19 - 74:24)
not redeem them the optimal not like the (74:22 - 74:26)
full (74:24 - 74:30)
dollar ten for your dollar correct (74:26 - 74:30)
why is everybody looking for a scam (74:32 - 74:35)
these days it's like everything's got to (74:33 - 74:37)
be a scam because everything is a scam i (74:35 - 74:42)
mean true welcome to capitalism (74:37 - 74:42)
i hope that (74:43 - 74:48)
ptcgl (74:45 - 74:50)
is good (74:48 - 74:52)
i hope so too i mean (74:50 - 74:55)
if there's a viable (74:52 - 74:55)
online method i might dip my toe into it (74:55 - 74:58)
even though i can't play my favorite (74:57 - 74:59)
pokemon in competitive decks there (74:58 - 75:02)
either (74:59 - 75:02)
[Music] (75:02 - 75:05)
you know your favorite pokemon isn't (75:06 - 75:10)
pikachu they got a lot of pikachu cards (75:07 - 75:11)
what has my favorite pokemon ever been (75:10 - 75:14)
pikachu (75:11 - 75:17)
when has it not have a mouse (75:14 - 75:20)
limelight from everything i think (75:17 - 75:21)
a little tcg (75:20 - 75:26)
talk little salt from tcg's side which (75:21 - 75:27)
greg (75:26 - 75:29)
may or may not have some amount of input (75:27 - 75:31)
on but i would say (75:29 - 75:33)
and i can't speak for yu-gi-oh i can't (75:31 - 75:35)
speak for force of will those games are (75:33 - 75:38)
beyond me but (75:35 - 75:40)
pokemon is like the one trading card (75:38 - 75:41)
game (75:40 - 75:43)
where if you buy a starter deck (75:41 - 75:44)
just (75:43 - 75:46)
throw it right in the trash because you (75:44 - 75:48)
will never be able to use any cards that (75:46 - 75:50)
come in a trial deck no it started (75:48 - 75:53)
actually gotten much much (75:50 - 75:53)
hey at least (75:56 - 75:59)
they (75:58 - 76:01)
aren't putting out a commander deck (75:59 - 76:04)
that's actually illegal to play in the (76:01 - 76:07)
format (76:04 - 76:07)
i (76:08 - 76:11)
i will say that there is probably a huge (76:09 - 76:13)
advantage of this game finally being on (76:11 - 76:14)
mobile (76:13 - 76:15)
yeah (76:14 - 76:17)
i play i may play it on my ipad but i'm (76:15 - 76:20)
sitting on a conference call hmm we're (76:17 - 76:23)
like some pokemans out (76:20 - 76:24)
so (76:23 - 76:27)
i don't know we'll see i we still don't (76:24 - 76:29)
even know who's making this game i don't (76:27 - 76:31)
think it's direwolf digital right (76:29 - 76:33)
no (76:31 - 76:33)
spilled the tea about not being able to (76:36 - 76:39)
make the game good and pokemon company (76:38 - 76:41)
was like well you could have kept your (76:39 - 76:43)
mouth quiet and gotten the new biz but (76:41 - 76:45)
you didn't i'm pretty sure they only did (76:43 - 76:48)
that when it was clear they were not (76:45 - 76:50)
be real (76:48 - 76:51)
the t comes out when you know the (76:50 - 76:53)
contract's gone and you're like (76:51 - 76:55)
we're never getting that back let's (76:53 - 76:57)
let's warn the next people coming down (76:55 - 76:58)
the pike (76:57 - 77:00)
what's this like that meme where it's (76:58 - 77:01)
like the person is like oh oh i've seen (77:00 - 77:03)
all i have to see you don't have to (77:01 - 77:05)
worry about me (77:03 - 77:05)
don't have to worry about me (77:06 - 77:11)

6 000 pokemon in pokemon home (77:32 - 77:37)

like even consumable though (80:02 - 80:07)
even if they don't like collect cards i (80:05 - 80:09)
think like as long as they like pokemon (80:07 - 80:11)
and they were gifted in etb i feel like (80:09 - 80:12)
they would still have a pretty good time (80:11 - 80:14)
opening packs (80:12 - 80:16)
and like looking at the artwork and (80:14 - 80:17)
being like oh this is cool and then they (80:16 - 80:18)
get like a box like store and they're (80:17 - 80:20)
stuck with a bunch of cards but that's (80:18 - 80:22)
like like a plush is doing like you give (80:20 - 80:24)
somebody a plush or like a fun coat it's (80:22 - 80:25)
just like oh this is cool and then you (80:24 - 80:27)
sit on the shelf yeah it's a decoration (80:25 - 80:28)
i'm not gonna put (80:27 - 80:31)
a loose cards on my shelf (80:28 - 80:33)
yeah i i also have the additional (80:31 - 80:36)
problem like the floette was a gift from (80:33 - 80:39)
the irish vgc national champion (80:36 - 80:40)
yeah (80:39 - 80:43)
ireland is a nation (80:40 - 80:44)
oh boy (80:43 - 80:47)
when he was here in the u.s (80:44 - 80:48)
the the little (80:47 - 80:51)
safari pikachu is my memory of that (80:48 - 80:53)
horrible horrible weekend with both of (80:51 - 80:54)
you (80:53 - 80:55)
here this is why i pulled this question (80:54 - 80:57)
because i i have thought of the best (80:55 - 81:00)
gift you can get all right all right you (80:57 - 81:02)
go to ebay (81:00 - 81:05)
we're already in the bad place (81:02 - 81:09)
you search for pokemon center (81:05 - 81:09)
mystery gift (81:10 - 81:14)
and then you whatever this year's (81:12 - 81:15)
mystery gift is i think it's a happy (81:14 - 81:16)
knee (81:15 - 81:19)
you order the digital happy birthday (81:16 - 81:21)
happy from pokemon center if you don't (81:19 - 81:24)
know how this works in japan if you walk (81:21 - 81:26)
into the pokemon center and you show (81:24 - 81:28)
them your driver's license or whatever (81:26 - 81:30)
where you prove to them that it's your (81:28 - 81:32)
birthday month they give you a free (81:30 - 81:34)
digital code for a pokemon right now it (81:32 - 81:36)
is hapini (81:34 - 81:38)
before it's been like eevee sometimes (81:36 - 81:41)
it's chansey sometimes it's pikachu (81:38 - 81:43)
and then that happy knee can be redeemed (81:41 - 81:45)
in brilliant diamond shining pearl (81:43 - 81:47)
sword and shield (81:45 - 81:49)
or pokemon legends (81:47 - 81:51)
and it's just a it's just a mystery gift (81:49 - 81:53)
code and when they download it it will (81:51 - 81:55)
have the happy birthday ribbon (81:53 - 81:57)
it will say it was from the pokemon (81:55 - 82:00)
center it'll be in a cherish ball unless (81:57 - 82:01)
you're dumb like me and you redeem it in (82:00 - 82:02)
legends where there are no ribbons and (82:01 - 82:04)
there are no terrorist balls so you just (82:02 - 82:06)
get a happy knee in a pokeball don't do (82:04 - 82:08)
that (82:06 - 82:08)
um it's like it's like 15 to 20 on ebay (82:09 - 82:18)
you just and there's just somebody (82:14 - 82:20)
on ebay is going to every pokemon center (82:18 - 82:22)
every day for a full month and showing (82:20 - 82:24)
all them their ids and collecting these (82:22 - 82:25)
code cards and then flipping them on (82:24 - 82:27)
ebay but look (82:25 - 82:29)
20 bucks is cheaper than a plane ticket (82:27 - 82:31)
to japan 20 bucks is like a pretty good (82:29 - 82:34)
like gift amount to spend on somebody it (82:31 - 82:36)
is something that they can redeem it'll (82:34 - 82:38)
say happy birthday they like pokemon (82:36 - 82:40)
they're probably playing sword and (82:38 - 82:41)
shield or something where does it say (82:40 - 82:43)
happy birthday (82:41 - 82:45)
it's a happy birthday ribbon yeah okay (82:43 - 82:49)
so uh my friend spent 20 on a pokemon i (82:45 - 82:50)
don't care about with a feature i don't (82:49 - 82:52)
care about and a ball i don't care about (82:50 - 82:54)
happy birthday to me yeah that sounds (82:52 - 82:56)
about typical (82:54 - 82:58)
yeah well what what is your friend gonna (82:56 - 82:59)
get you like a cinder club plush and (82:58 - 83:00)
it's just gonna sit in the box on the (82:59 - 83:03)
shelf behind you never unpackage still (83:00 - 83:06)
has the tags this is pure value that (83:03 - 83:08)
cyndaquil right there that's only going (83:06 - 83:10)
up in value exactly (83:08 - 83:13)
my my birthday gift was (83:10 - 83:17)
that alolan vulpex right there (83:13 - 83:19)
look i mean here's the thing about gifts (83:17 - 83:22)
find out what they like (83:19 - 83:24)
and go in that vein like this yeah you (83:22 - 83:26)
don't feel like happy birthday happiness (83:24 - 83:29)
is i think it's cute it's cute but again (83:26 - 83:32)
it's not (83:29 - 83:32)
i mean you're making a lot of (83:33 - 83:36)
assumptions about what they want (83:34 - 83:38)
what if they like sword and shield i (83:36 - 83:40)
love they that's their favorite game (83:38 - 83:42)
okay that's yeah i mean (83:40 - 83:43)
then you're doing the research of (83:42 - 83:45)
finding out what they like and then (83:43 - 83:46)
making decisions accordingly what if (83:45 - 83:48)
their favorite pokemon is happini that's (83:46 - 83:51)
like a slam dunk the real answer to this (83:48 - 83:53)
question is go buy your own pokemon (83:51 - 83:57)
stuff stop trying to raid my inventory (83:53 - 84:01)
i mean i have a lot of plushies that (83:57 - 84:04)
i definitely would you know i've got two (84:01 - 84:05)
stabilized (84:04 - 84:06)
actually i have two stabilizers and one (84:05 - 84:09)
that was homemade for me so (84:06 - 84:09)
all right pokemon of the week (84:11 - 84:15)
well oh i forgot to look up last week's (84:13 - 84:17)
pokemon i forgot to look up (84:15 - 84:18)
oops (84:17 - 84:21)
thank goodness for a recent document (84:18 - 84:23)
here in the uh (84:21 - 84:27)
in this little computer uh so i was (84:23 - 84:29)
referencing my last my playthrough of (84:27 - 84:32)
pokemon white (84:29 - 84:35)
and how i preferred zekrom over resharam (84:32 - 84:38)
and i selected the starter that shares a (84:35 - 84:40)
type with one of the box legends and the (84:38 - 84:43)
original mythical for unova (84:40 - 84:46)
and its final evolution has a name (84:43 - 84:48)
similar to and possibly derived from a (84:46 - 84:51)
move that many starters of the same type (84:48 - 84:54)
learn as their first stab move around (84:51 - 84:56)
level five six or seven (84:54 - 84:59)
do you say russia rob resharam (84:56 - 85:01)
pressure ram (84:59 - 85:03)
now it has to rhyme with zekrom and (85:01 - 85:05)
crime and resharam (85:03 - 85:06)
zekram (85:05 - 85:08)
zakram and rushy ram (85:06 - 85:11)
it's (85:08 - 85:14)
chat (85:11 - 85:14)
[Music] (85:15 - 85:18)
shuffle icon really excellent (85:25 - 85:30)
and an incredible shiny like let's be (85:28 - 85:31)
real (85:30 - 85:33)
and bore for being (85:31 - 85:36)
mbor has a great shiny (85:33 - 85:38)
it does yeah it does have a really (85:36 - 85:41)
really good shiny (85:38 - 85:44)
uh ambor is the only starter that has a (85:41 - 85:46)
different hidden ability than its (85:44 - 85:49)
evolutionary relatives wait what's (85:46 - 85:51)
happenability (85:49 - 85:53)
oh (85:51 - 85:57)
reckless what's tepigs (85:53 - 85:57)
oh thick fat (85:58 - 86:01)
i don't think that would have mattered (86:04 - 86:07)
on emboar no one's using a nice tight (86:05 - 86:09)
move on them (86:07 - 86:12)
uh emboar has the highest base hp stat (86:09 - 86:14)
of any fully evolved starter pokemon (86:12 - 86:17)
emboard is entire is tied with italian (86:14 - 86:19)
for the lowest special defense stat of a (86:17 - 86:21)
starter pokemon (86:19 - 86:23)
mbor is tied with sceptile and intellion (86:21 - 86:25)
for the lowest (86:23 - 86:27)
base defense stat oh boy (86:25 - 86:29)
and we're really striking out here (86:27 - 86:31)
emboar samurai and superior all have the (86:29 - 86:34)
same base that total of 528 (86:31 - 86:36)
um emboar appears in pokemon battle (86:34 - 86:38)
chest black white version alongside (86:36 - 86:41)
victini it is the only piece that raises (86:38 - 86:43)
power when damaged alongside zoroark (86:41 - 86:45)
emboar doesn't behave like any (86:43 - 86:48)
traditional piece in chess (86:45 - 86:48)
and (86:49 - 86:51)
it kind of full circle here we talked (86:50 - 86:52)
about chess earlier and now we're (86:51 - 86:54)
talking about chess again what is this (86:52 - 86:57)
conquest image of embore why is it 90 (86:54 - 86:59)
booty (86:57 - 87:01)
look it's doing uh (86:59 - 87:03)
like a a (87:01 - 87:04)
pile (87:03 - 87:05)
yeah (87:04 - 87:08)
i mean as the person that spent (87:05 - 87:11)
80 hours in pokemon snap (87:08 - 87:13)
taking booty pics (87:11 - 87:16)
this is right up your alley (87:13 - 87:19)
pokemon conquest was a good game it was (87:16 - 87:21)
they should make it two for uh the (87:19 - 87:24)
switch and now so i could sell like (87:21 - 87:26)
200 000 units (87:24 - 87:28)
i don't think conquest made it to a (87:26 - 87:29)
million units (87:28 - 87:31)
it got halfway there i'm pretty sure the (87:29 - 87:34)
last time i checked (87:31 - 87:34)
are we ready for this week's pokemon (87:35 - 87:39)
boys ready all right uh unfortunately i (87:37 - 87:42)
was trying to be um i was very ambitious (87:39 - 87:45)
and i think i fell short of my ambition (87:42 - 87:48)
so here we go (87:45 - 87:51)
much like australian power plants you (87:48 - 87:53)
should not attempt to learn how words (87:51 - 87:56)
are spelled from pokemon names (87:53 - 87:57)
in recent news (87:56 - 88:00)
australia's era ring power station (87:57 - 88:03)
suspiciously spelled closely enough to (88:00 - 88:05)
earring to cause confuse the casual (88:03 - 88:07)
reader (88:05 - 88:09)
located in the central coast of new (88:07 - 88:11)
south wales has announced that it will (88:09 - 88:16)
close in 2025 rather than 2032 (88:11 - 88:17)
because of the heavy impact of the (88:16 - 88:20)
growth of renewable energy sources has (88:17 - 88:24)
had on error rings profitability (88:20 - 88:27)
in an almost direct reversal of course (88:24 - 88:29)
the error ring location will be (88:27 - 88:32)
converted into a 700 megawatt battery (88:29 - 88:34)
used to store energy from renewable (88:32 - 88:35)
sources (88:34 - 88:37)
the government and citizens of galler (88:35 - 88:39)
would be well suited to learn from (88:37 - 88:41)
australia's experience in both naming (88:39 - 88:44)
pokemon and sources of energy (88:41 - 88:46)
while this week's pokemon doesn't burn a (88:44 - 88:47)
fossil fuel itself like its (88:46 - 88:50)
pre-evolution it has been noted to drop (88:47 - 88:53)
a major contributor to worldwide co2 (88:50 - 88:54)
emissions (88:53 - 88:57)
potentially galler could investigate (88:54 - 88:59)
removing these pokemon from mine and (88:57 - 89:02)
mine number two and replacing them with (88:59 - 89:04)
the equally palindromic (89:02 - 89:09)
palindromically numbered chargebug (89:04 - 89:09)
and palindromically is a hard word (89:09 - 89:13)
did you get that charge bug at the end (89:18 - 89:21)
i got the charge bug at the end all (89:22 - 89:27)
right hey thanks for listening (89:23 - 89:29)
uh we don't exactly know when pokemon (89:27 - 89:31)
day is supposed to be (89:29 - 89:33)
uh i'm going to expect it's going to be (89:31 - 89:35)
this week before (89:33 - 89:36)
the weekend (89:35 - 89:39)
uh if that is the case i will be if it (89:36 - 89:42)
there is an actual video announcement or (89:39 - 89:44)
something i will be live streaming that (89:42 - 89:46)
on twitch and then that will probably be (89:44 - 89:47)
sent to youtube (89:46 - 89:49)
so you can get my impressions and then (89:47 - 89:50)
we'll probably just wait till sunday (89:49 - 89:52)

come out on monday i am sure that (89:52 - 89:57)
you i (89:56 - 89:59)
i'm sure it'll be exciting and if it's (89:57 - 90:00)
not that i'm sure it'll be disappointing (89:59 - 90:02)
i don't know it's the 26th year it's not (90:00 - 90:05)
the 25th year so (90:02 - 90:05)
i don't take this for what it's worth (90:05 - 90:09)
i would expect we're getting something (90:07 - 90:10)
in november (90:09 - 90:12)
i'm okay with what anything look if they (90:10 - 90:14)
were like black and white (90:12 - 90:16)
