will also here yeah i (1:00 - 1:06)
have added two things to my where i have (1:04 - 1:08)
two things now i might don't ever do (1:06 - 1:10)
this list number one never read the (1:08 - 1:11)
youtube comments (1:10 - 1:13)
which i still can make the mistake of (1:11 - 1:14)
doing (1:13 - 1:16)
number two (1:14 - 1:19)
never listen to this program like a in a (1:16 - 1:21)
previously recorded episode of this (1:19 - 1:22)
program on the morning that we record it (1:21 - 1:25)
because now i just i hate both of you (1:22 - 1:27)
i just want to spend the next 90 minutes (1:25 - 1:29)
telling you why you're wrong about (1:27 - 1:32)
everything why what what are you mad (1:29 - 1:34)
what could you possibly be so many (1:32 - 1:38)
things so yeah we're always right why (1:34 - 1:41)
are you so hateful we have good takes (1:38 - 1:42)
that's because of my east coast (1:41 - 1:44)
upbringing (1:42 - 1:46)
i mean i don't listen to drive check (1:44 - 1:48)
yeah (1:46 - 1:51)
you're wise not too (1:48 - 1:51)
where do we begin today where do we (1:58 - 2:03)
begin uh i'm playing unite again (1:59 - 2:07)
uh we could start with you night i guess (2:03 - 2:09)
uh okay so here's here's the show we got (2:07 - 2:12)
uh i think we we all done massive mass (2:09 - 2:15)
outbreaks want to talk about that (2:12 - 2:16)
um (2:15 - 2:18)
unite was on the list (2:16 - 2:20)
there's some pokemon go stuff (2:18 - 2:22)
there's a minnesota store getting broken (2:20 - 2:25)
into and pokemon stuff through the wall (2:22 - 2:28)
so we played man style (2:25 - 2:29)
um (2:28 - 2:32)
i hate to be the bearer of bad news at (2:29 - 2:34)
the start of this program but there is (2:32 - 2:36)
nothing new in regards to scarlet and (2:34 - 2:38)
violet (2:36 - 2:40)
oh that attitude we can make up a whole (2:38 - 2:41)
bunch of stuff (2:40 - 2:43)
wait did you guys see that youtube clip (2:41 - 2:45)
that i posted (2:43 - 2:47)
i put it on twitter (2:45 - 2:50)
dang it was the episode where it was al (2:47 - 2:51)
because we were talking about the (2:50 - 2:54)
legends archaea spoilers and i literally (2:51 - 2:56)
said they haven't made a pokemon game in (2:54 - 2:58)
spain yet (2:56 - 3:00)
find it on twitter when did you put this (2:58 - 3:03)
up you're in my list like three days ago (3:00 - 3:05)
three or four days ago then yes i saw it (3:03 - 3:08)
i probably forgot (3:05 - 3:08)
um (3:12 - 3:15)
yeah i guess uh let's let's start with (3:14 - 3:18)
pokemon unite (3:15 - 3:21)
a game (3:18 - 3:21)
so i i logged into unite because i (3:25 - 3:31)
wanted to get my free pokemon day stuff (3:27 - 3:33)
you had to log in two days one day for (3:31 - 3:35)
the hat one day for the shirt you didn't (3:33 - 3:37)
have to play any games (3:35 - 3:39)
there is a uh walk (3:37 - 3:42)
also for the record uh a lot of people (3:39 - 3:44)
make very nice youtube comments well so (3:42 - 3:46)
thank you if you're watching on youtube (3:44 - 3:48)
and you left a very nice guy a lot of (3:46 - 3:50)
people make atrocious youtube comments (3:48 - 3:53)
look it look if you know nothing about (3:50 - 3:55)
will at this point (3:53 - 3:56)
understand (3:55 - 3:59)
there is no positive view there is only (3:56 - 4:02)
negative view yes so this is correct you (3:59 - 4:05)
could have 50 million positive things we (4:02 - 4:07)
love will will is super cute will's the (4:05 - 4:10)
hottest will is amazing and there'll be (4:07 - 4:11)
one that says (4:10 - 4:14)
what even is that accent and that is all (4:11 - 4:16)
we will hear about correct for five (4:14 - 4:17)
years (4:16 - 4:19)
also if you do say something nice i (4:17 - 4:20)
become suspicious of what are you trying (4:19 - 4:22)
to get from me (4:20 - 4:24)
it's a very east coast attitude (4:22 - 4:26)
i would say that like (4:24 - 4:28)
99 (4:26 - 4:29)
of the negative comments are usually in (4:28 - 4:32)
regards to me though (4:29 - 4:34)
usually yeah youtube it's the one (4:32 - 4:36)
percent because we don't care about you (4:34 - 4:39)
yeah yeah usually like the one percent (4:36 - 4:43)
is like your show is too gay (4:39 - 4:43)
the like other 99 percent is like steve (4:43 - 4:48)
has really bad you cannot say (4:46 - 4:50)
in the winter months the show is too gay (4:48 - 4:52)
because neither will nor i are wearing (4:50 - 4:53)
tank tops (4:52 - 4:55)
correct (4:53 - 4:57)
that is a summertime (4:55 - 5:02)
happenstance over time complaint (4:57 - 5:02)
where am i putting any negatives you can (5:03 - 5:06)
walk cramarant and pokemon unite and (5:04 - 5:08)
that's the only way that i've gotten (5:06 - 5:10)
kramaran's license because i was not (5:08 - 5:11)
going to buy that thing (5:10 - 5:13)
oh you get its license right yeah i got (5:11 - 5:15)
his license for that okay yeah yeah so (5:13 - 5:17)
so there was there was the pokemon day (5:15 - 5:19)
stuff with the hoopa and the baking (5:17 - 5:20)
donuts i don't think this was ever (5:19 - 5:23)
talked about in the show uh (5:20 - 5:25)
but there's like you know how pikachu (5:23 - 5:27)
and ketchup is like (5:25 - 5:29)
canonical yeah (5:27 - 5:31)
yes very much so (5:29 - 5:34)
hoopa and donuts is canonical because of (5:31 - 5:36)
rings (5:34 - 5:40)
that i understand the i get why (5:36 - 5:42)
i don't know when it started though was (5:40 - 5:45)
it like a movie thing i mean in 1998 (5:42 - 5:47)
they had an idea for pocket monsters (5:45 - 5:50)
uh-huh okay and then eventually they're (5:47 - 5:51)
like well what what else do we make and (5:50 - 5:53)
somebody said how about rings and like (5:51 - 5:54)
cool (5:53 - 5:56)
how do we make rings promotional what (5:54 - 5:57)
can we sell that are rings donuts (5:56 - 6:00)
everybody loves donuts and thus it was (5:57 - 6:02)
born (6:00 - 6:02)
yeah i it was except for steve who will (6:03 - 6:09)
not do due diligence in his donut places (6:06 - 6:12)
and then complain about them oh dr hoopa (6:09 - 6:14)
that donut place is very expensive (6:12 - 6:16)
uh did you unlock hoopa or did you do (6:14 - 6:18)
enough donuts no i'm halfway to (6:16 - 6:20)
unlocking hoopa and i have not done (6:18 - 6:21)
enough donuts (6:20 - 6:23)
so i (6:21 - 6:26)
was like if i'm gonna play (6:23 - 6:27)
this game (6:26 - 6:28)
i'm going to (6:27 - 6:32)
buy the 35 dollar cremerant skin oh i (6:28 - 6:34)
watch this in real time i'm zoning out (6:32 - 6:37)
for this (6:34 - 6:39)
and to be fair (6:37 - 6:41)
i've only given this game twenty dollars (6:39 - 6:44)
and that was day one and since then the (6:41 - 6:47)
pokemon company has given me (6:44 - 6:49)
three stipends and i think each stipend (6:47 - 6:52)
was like five (6:49 - 6:53)
three thousand five hundred gems three (6:52 - 6:55)
thousand five hundred gems which is (6:53 - 6:58)
fifty dollars i believe (6:55 - 6:59)
so i have (6:58 - 7:03)
a ton of gems that i have never spent (6:59 - 7:04)
because (7:03 - 7:06)
you know i bought the business suit for (7:04 - 7:08)
for venusaur (7:06 - 7:10)
yeah (7:08 - 7:11)
i remember that (7:10 - 7:13)
and i bought the give those give them to (7:11 - 7:15)
me i could buy something with them (7:13 - 7:17)
i've never bought a character with them (7:15 - 7:18)
because like (7:17 - 7:19)
you want to use your coins on characters (7:18 - 7:21)
not gems (7:19 - 7:22)
and i was like (7:21 - 7:24)
i'm not going to buy the cowboy i think (7:22 - 7:27)
it's called frontier frontier (7:24 - 7:30)
cramer ant unless i'm going to play a (7:27 - 7:31)
match of this game i'm not gonna do the (7:30 - 7:33)
thing i'm not gonna log in get my (7:31 - 7:37)
rewards buy a skin and then not play (7:33 - 7:40)
so my twitch chat was like just play one (7:37 - 7:42)
game and i was like all right here we go (7:40 - 7:44)
we're buying the cram skin (7:42 - 7:47)
and it's not in the store at all (7:44 - 7:51)
what yeah it's not i have i have i have (7:47 - 7:55)
gems to burn and it is not there and (7:51 - 7:57)
i'm looking online to see if this was (7:55 - 8:00)
limited because there was that lucario (7:57 - 8:02)
for halloween and it said limited time (8:00 - 8:04)
will expire and i don't remember that at (8:02 - 8:06)
all (8:04 - 8:08)
and i'm thinking do i go back to like an (8:06 - 8:10)
old twitch mod when i first looked at (8:08 - 8:12)
this so i can double check if it's (8:10 - 8:13)
limited or not and then everyone was (8:12 - 8:15)
like no it never said that was limited i (8:13 - 8:17)
was like i don't even know i get why you (8:15 - 8:19)
would remove a hollow like a holiday (8:17 - 8:21)
skin (8:19 - 8:25)
but but you're we're still in season (8:21 - 8:27)
four or five or whatever we're still in (8:25 - 8:30)
cowboy season because i don't care about (8:27 - 8:32)
cowboy stuff i i have zero interest in (8:30 - 8:34)
this battle pass (8:32 - 8:36)
the final thing is like cowboy zero aura (8:34 - 8:37)
i (8:36 - 8:39)
have no interest (8:37 - 8:42)
in that i don't want my character to (8:39 - 8:45)
have a cowboy hat or cowboy boots or uh (8:42 - 8:47)
the the little bow tie i can't remember (8:45 - 8:51)
what it's called um bellow the ball i (8:47 - 8:52)
don't want any of that not buying the (8:51 - 8:53)
battle pass (8:52 - 8:55)
but (8:53 - 8:57)
we have a walk with crameran event we (8:55 - 8:59)
have a cowboy (8:57 - 9:01)
battle pass frontier (8:59 - 9:04)
frontier battle palace why (9:01 - 9:06)
is my cramer ant gone (9:04 - 9:09)
and so if you go into where the cooking (9:06 - 9:12)
cram rant is to like adjust the cowboy (9:09 - 9:15)
crab ranch shows up and it says 2 1999 (9:12 - 9:18)
ace eos gems which is i think 35 because (9:15 - 9:19)
the (9:18 - 9:22)
2499 aos gems which is like nine tails (9:19 - 9:24)
in machamp and the lucario that got (9:22 - 9:26)
pulled (9:24 - 9:28)
that's forty dollars (9:26 - 9:29)
and i went to go cl i was like there it (9:28 - 9:31)
is i found it for some reason it's not (9:29 - 9:32)
in the store it's right here i click it (9:31 - 9:34)
and it says (9:32 - 9:37)
not available not available (9:34 - 9:40)
and i found one reddit post that was (9:37 - 9:42)
somebody saying (9:40 - 9:44)
what ha they said that this is the worst (9:42 - 9:45)
part (9:44 - 9:47)
they said hey (9:45 - 9:50)
i finally purchased gems for the first (9:47 - 9:52)
time (9:50 - 9:54)
to buy this crammer ant skin and i went (9:52 - 9:56)
to go and buy it (9:54 - 9:59)
and it's gone (9:56 - 9:59)
and and no one knows why and i went to (9:59 - 10:04)
refund the gems and i was told by (10:02 - 10:08)
support gems are non-refundable mm-hmm (10:04 - 10:10)
that makes sense (10:08 - 10:11)
i mean yeah it makes sense that the gems (10:10 - 10:14)
are non-refundable (10:11 - 10:16)
but if you can see it because i (10:14 - 10:18)
we saw on stream you can clearly see the (10:16 - 10:20)
skin under like you have to go you kind (10:18 - 10:21)
of have to dig for it but you can like (10:20 - 10:23)
clearly find it and it says like buy it (10:21 - 10:26)
has a purchase button (10:23 - 10:27)
you wouldn't click that button if you (10:26 - 10:30)
don't have enough gems (10:27 - 10:33)
because it would ever out right (10:30 - 10:34)
so you leave to buy the gym you don't (10:33 - 10:36)
have enough gems yeah it would say you (10:34 - 10:38)
don't have enough gems so you would (10:36 - 10:40)
leave you would add the gems you would (10:38 - 10:41)
come back you would hit purchase then it (10:40 - 10:43)
would say not available (10:41 - 10:44)
i don't know (10:43 - 10:46)
i don't know why the skin is not (10:44 - 10:47)
available (10:46 - 10:48)
i don't know why this game would not (10:47 - 10:50)
want to take my money the only thing i (10:48 - 10:52)
could think of is (10:50 - 10:57)
the skin caused a game breaking bug (10:52 - 10:58)
and they didn't know how to fix the bug (10:57 - 11:00)
so they pulled the skin (10:58 - 11:02)
how would a skin (11:00 - 11:04)
oh the animation of it (11:02 - 11:05)
could it could do something look there (11:04 - 11:07)
was one point where kramer was (11:05 - 11:08)
invincible for like three days in that (11:07 - 11:11)
game oh that's right (11:08 - 11:11)
and people people would on the other (11:12 - 11:16)
team would see you were playing cramer (11:14 - 11:20)
and they would quit they would forfeit (11:16 - 11:22)
it's valid (11:20 - 11:22)
anyways you didn't buy the skin i did (11:22 - 11:27)
not buy the skin and there's no reason (11:25 - 11:30)
listed so we know they listen to this (11:27 - 11:31)
show (11:30 - 11:32)
right so (11:31 - 11:35)
we need explanation we need an exclusive (11:32 - 11:37)
press release sent to steve (11:35 - 11:40)
uh i should say dear steve and kramer (11:37 - 11:42)
ant fans (11:40 - 11:45)
around the world all three of you (11:42 - 11:46)
please (11:45 - 11:49)
understand our mistake and here's what (11:46 - 11:51)
happened (11:49 - 11:53)
so (11:51 - 11:54)
it's been several months since you (11:53 - 11:55)
played unite how do you feel about it (11:54 - 11:57)
now greg (11:55 - 12:00)
it's like i never stopped playing (11:57 - 12:02)
it all the frustrations that existed (12:00 - 12:04)
before (12:02 - 12:07)
still exist today (12:04 - 12:07)
i will say i will say i tried out (12:07 - 12:13)
uh zarina and i tried not to situate and (12:11 - 12:16)
i really like both how both play (12:13 - 12:18)
but the problem (12:16 - 12:20)
still exists that if you you have to buy (12:18 - 12:21)
up (12:20 - 12:23)
the items to (12:21 - 12:24)
30 (12:23 - 12:26)
because all of them use different items (12:24 - 12:29)
according to everybody (12:26 - 12:31)
and people still don't communicate i'm (12:29 - 12:32)
like (12:31 - 12:34)
how (12:32 - 12:35)
one it takes forever to get a match now (12:34 - 12:37)
because there's so few people playing (12:35 - 12:39)
it did take us really we played what two (12:37 - 12:41)
matches together i think yeah we lost (12:39 - 12:43)
one that we won one yeah (12:41 - 12:46)
so it takes forever to match and (12:43 - 12:48)
the people who are left still don't say (12:46 - 12:50)
like i'm going to this lane (12:48 - 12:53)
still and you still have four people (12:50 - 12:54)
picking jungle and then they all go into (12:53 - 12:58)
jungle and one person's left going (12:54 - 13:01)
what am i supposed to do (12:58 - 13:03)
uh i'm alone (13:01 - 13:05)
once again i am a (13:03 - 13:06)
elder gus (13:05 - 13:09)
by myself at the bottom getting wrecked (13:06 - 13:11)
by lucario (13:09 - 13:11)
and they haven't done a patch balance in (13:12 - 13:16)
a long time and i'm like (13:14 - 13:18)
do you just not (13:16 - 13:21)
care anymore about the game because well (13:18 - 13:23)
thank you (13:21 - 13:26)
eventually come out (13:23 - 13:26)
i (13:32 - 13:35)
look i i had a pretty good time playing (13:32 - 13:38)
uh i'm playing again like (13:35 - 13:40)
it reminded me of how fun the game is (13:38 - 13:43)
but quickly also reminded me how (13:40 - 13:46)
absolutely frustrating the game is like (13:43 - 13:48)
in i played i think i played like 20 (13:46 - 13:50)
more matches now because i was like i'm (13:48 - 13:52)
just gonna see how ranked is i want to (13:50 - 13:54)
play these new characters (13:52 - 13:56)
people are still surrendering within the (13:54 - 13:58)
first two minutes and if you don't (13:56 - 13:59)
surrender when they want to they just (13:58 - 14:02)
drop (13:59 - 14:05)
and then you have a thing sitting in the (14:02 - 14:06)
base it's like well if you're not going (14:05 - 14:07)
to quit what i want you to then i'm (14:06 - 14:08)
going to make sure you can't play the (14:07 - 14:10)
game (14:08 - 14:11)
penalty for dropping (14:10 - 14:13)
huh (14:11 - 14:15)
do they get penalized for dropping only (14:13 - 14:18)
if you report them (14:15 - 14:18)
i forgot there was a report button which (14:18 - 14:23)
is now hard to find they have hidden in (14:20 - 14:26)
their menus how you get to be able to (14:23 - 14:28)
report a person because it took me 10 (14:26 - 14:29)
minutes to find it i'm like oh there it (14:28 - 14:32)
is i'm reporting you again and i'm back (14:29 - 14:34)
on my reporting stuff because i'm like (14:32 - 14:36)
you (14:34 - 14:39)
you should not have a good ranking (14:36 - 14:41)
but yeah they've hidden it so they've (14:39 - 14:43)
hidden it so far in the menus that it's (14:41 - 14:45)
hard to report plus you have to use (14:43 - 14:48)
their bad keyboard to be able to report (14:45 - 14:50)
somebody it's like (14:48 - 14:52)
you have you are doing nothing to make (14:50 - 14:53)
the game (14:52 - 14:54)
player base of your game (14:53 - 14:56)
[Music] (14:54 - 14:59)
good like you you you (14:56 - 15:01)
you're just letting (14:59 - 15:02)
awful people (15:01 - 15:04)
run rampant still (15:02 - 15:07)
this is my worry for the game is (15:04 - 15:09)
that people would get frustrated and (15:07 - 15:10)
then they would leave and then they (15:09 - 15:12)
would not come back and i don't think (15:10 - 15:14)
like it would be me you could be the (15:12 - 15:16)
biggest dragonite fan in the world (15:14 - 15:19)
and you might grab some of the dragonite (15:16 - 15:22)
fans to come back but (15:19 - 15:22)
i i don't see like if you didn't enjoy (15:22 - 15:26)
the gameplay and they finally added your (15:25 - 15:28)
favorite pokemon you come back and you (15:26 - 15:29)
still experience all the frustrations (15:28 - 15:30)
you're not going to suffer through (15:29 - 15:32)
playing your favorite pokemon (15:30 - 15:34)
through this game the only thing i can (15:32 - 15:37)
think of at this point is like (15:34 - 15:39)
the world championship sparking (15:37 - 15:41)
people to be excited to want to come (15:39 - 15:43)
back you see this thing you see you see (15:41 - 15:44)
the same things that happen with like (15:43 - 15:47)
dota or league where people get burnt (15:44 - 15:48)
out from those mobas and then all of a (15:47 - 15:50)
sudden they see a really great world (15:48 - 15:52)
championship and there's usually an (15:50 - 15:53)
update around there and there's usually (15:52 - 15:55)
a bunch of free stuff and all of that (15:53 - 15:57)
combined people (15:55 - 15:59)
get excited and they come back to the (15:57 - 16:01)
game this is also a thing that happened (15:59 - 16:03)
i saw firsthand with people that watch (16:01 - 16:04)
competitive pokemon like (16:03 - 16:06)
they they sat down they watched the (16:04 - 16:08)
world championship it was they saw the (16:06 - 16:10)
energy of other people getting excited (16:08 - 16:11)
and then (16:10 - 16:11)
they (16:11 - 16:13)
they want to (16:11 - 16:15)
partake in that and they want to like at (16:13 - 16:16)
least learn more (16:15 - 16:20)
and maybe like buy the newest game or or (16:16 - 16:21)
or whatnot so (16:20 - 16:24)
my my worry was i'm going to come back (16:21 - 16:26)
it's just going to be really hardcore or (16:24 - 16:28)
really salty people (16:26 - 16:29)
and (16:28 - 16:31)
i wouldn't say it took too long for us (16:29 - 16:32)
to find a match but it was significantly (16:31 - 16:34)
longer than it was back in like november (16:32 - 16:36)
like (16:34 - 16:38)
i think we weighed in the cube like a (16:36 - 16:40)
whole 90 seconds i've never waited 90 (16:38 - 16:42)
seconds for a ranked match yep (16:40 - 16:45)
uh i mean and playing solo wasn't much (16:42 - 16:46)
better i (16:45 - 16:49)
it would often be a minute (16:46 - 16:51)
before i would get something just as a (16:49 - 16:52)
solo queue (16:51 - 16:54)
on uh no matter which queue i picked (16:52 - 16:58)
although standard goes obviously (16:54 - 17:00)
faster but (16:58 - 17:00)
if you think people in ranked could care (17:02 - 17:06)
less people in standard (17:04 - 17:08)
are even lower they're like nope it (17:06 - 17:10)
didn't go the first five seconds didn't (17:08 - 17:13)
go the way that i wanted i'm out (17:10 - 17:15)
like why are you playing this game (17:13 - 17:17)
i had that thought when my first my very (17:15 - 17:20)
very first match this weekend i like (17:17 - 17:22)
missed my whirlpool on the apom and i (17:20 - 17:25)
was like well time to concede candy (17:22 - 17:25)
i mean it's fine to have the thought but (17:26 - 17:30)
like (17:28 - 17:30)
duh it (17:31 - 17:35)
if you are having such a miserable time (17:33 - 17:36)
in the first five seconds that you just (17:35 - 17:40)
want to be out stop playing the game (17:36 - 17:43)
i mean stop ruining it for other people (17:40 - 17:45)
because when you drop in a game that is (17:43 - 17:48)
five versus five and suddenly (17:45 - 17:50)
it takes the game (17:48 - 17:52)
40 seconds to finally say oh somebody (17:50 - 17:54)
dropped and do you want to make them a (17:52 - 17:56)
robot the damage is done you are not (17:54 - 17:59)
coming back from that and the robots are (17:56 - 18:02)
bad yeah (17:59 - 18:04)
i mean i've been in one robot match and (18:02 - 18:06)
i'm like (18:04 - 18:06)
none of you are doing it and i can't (18:07 - 18:12)
even tell you what to do (18:09 - 18:12)
in (18:13 - 18:15)
that's what they should do when somebody (18:16 - 18:20)
drops or plays with psyduck (18:17 - 18:21)
it's just one of those things where i'm (18:20 - 18:23)
like i (18:21 - 18:25)
i have enough fun in the game that i (18:23 - 18:27)
want to play it (18:25 - 18:29)
but you do nothing to make your player (18:27 - 18:32)
base (18:29 - 18:32)
good and even reporting a highly (18:32 - 18:37)
offensive name which i ran into is (18:35 - 18:39)
incredibly difficult (18:37 - 18:41)
because you've hidden reports so far in (18:39 - 18:43)
the menus (18:41 - 18:46)
do you think that most of your problems (18:43 - 18:49)
would have would be solved if you had a (18:46 - 18:53)
consistent for other people to play with (18:49 - 18:53)
i think half of the problems would be (18:54 - 18:59)
solved yeah (18:57 - 18:59)
but again we'd have to communicate (19:00 - 19:03)
outside the game to compensate for that (19:01 - 19:05)
one person that's like that's how that (19:03 - 19:10)
game works best yeah absolutely yeah (19:05 - 19:10)
when i was in that like twitch (19:11 - 19:15)
tournament for twitch rivals (19:13 - 19:17)
there and i was playing with people that (19:15 - 19:18)
were (19:17 - 19:20)
you know they wanted to win right (19:18 - 19:22)
and we had a bunch of practice matches (19:20 - 19:24)
and (19:22 - 19:26)
i i could already there was already a (19:24 - 19:28)
little pushback on my end personally i (19:26 - 19:30)
don't think i've discussed this (19:28 - 19:33)
like there were there were there were uh (19:30 - 19:34)
there was a person on the team that was (19:33 - 19:36)
not happy i was playing crime rant (19:34 - 19:39)
uh because cramer was not a meta pick (19:36 - 19:41)
at the time (19:39 - 19:45)
and so that was fine i was i i like and (19:41 - 19:48)
when i filled out the form (19:45 - 19:49)
that's what i wrote like there was a (19:48 - 19:51)
draft i was not one of the team captains (19:49 - 19:53)
i just got drafted but in my notes it (19:51 - 19:55)
was like i only play cramer (19:53 - 19:58)
[Laughter] (19:55 - 20:01)
like i (19:58 - 20:01)
i (20:01 - 20:03)
and there's no benefit there would have (20:02 - 20:05)
been no benefit of me picking a more (20:03 - 20:07)
meta character when then i would have (20:05 - 20:10)
had to relearn the meta (20:07 - 20:12)
um and they were also making us play on (20:10 - 20:14)
samsung phones and it was like all right (20:12 - 20:16)
now i have to now learn a touch screen (20:14 - 20:19)
way of interfacing with this game (20:16 - 20:21)
and even though i i was playing with (20:19 - 20:22)
really good people and they were (20:21 - 20:23)
communicating there was still (20:22 - 20:25)
frustration after some matches like (20:23 - 20:28)
there was one point in one of the games (20:25 - 20:30)
where they told me to alt i think it was (20:28 - 20:33)
to like help burn down zapdos quicker (20:30 - 20:35)
and i've played cramer ant so much like (20:33 - 20:37)
i'm thinking in my head like no this (20:35 - 20:39)
this is not a good alt that's not a good (20:37 - 20:40)
use to your all but when you have like (20:39 - 20:43)
two or three people one being the team (20:40 - 20:45)
captain being like alt now (20:43 - 20:46)
well if i don't alt they're going to be (20:45 - 20:48)
mad at me (20:46 - 20:51)
yes so i do alt and it doesn't work (20:48 - 20:53)
like it didn't it did not burn down (20:51 - 20:55)
zapdos enough and then of course the (20:53 - 20:56)
team swoops in because my ultimate is (20:55 - 20:58)
over and then they take zapdos and we (20:56 - 21:00)
lose zeptos (20:58 - 21:01)
and i feel like (21:00 - 21:03)
i can tell that they're frustrated (21:01 - 21:06)
because like it didn't work (21:03 - 21:07)
but also that was their call (21:06 - 21:09)
and like i knew it didn't work and i (21:07 - 21:11)
knew like repositioning my kramer and (21:09 - 21:14)
more down and alting there to prevent (21:11 - 21:15)
them from even coming up would have been (21:14 - 21:17)
the better play (21:15 - 21:17)
um (21:17 - 21:19)
so yeah you still you still get that (21:17 - 21:22)
frustration um and then you see like you (21:19 - 21:24)
do see some (21:22 - 21:24)
competitive teams that have been playing (21:25 - 21:29)
very long together and i feel like you (21:27 - 21:31)
never see them frustrated because like (21:29 - 21:32)
they're just all on the same page (21:31 - 21:34)
they're all just like (21:32 - 21:36)
well they're a machine at that point (21:34 - 21:37)
right because they've been playing for (21:36 - 21:40)
so long like that like if you if you've (21:37 - 21:42)
started a team when this game came out (21:40 - 21:45)
and you're still a team and there hasn't (21:42 - 21:47)
been any drama (21:45 - 21:50)
uh you probably you're like yep we just (21:47 - 21:53)
lost this game because we messed up (21:50 - 21:53)
the shame is is the game (21:54 - 22:00)
i i think the game is really good (21:57 - 22:03)
still like (22:00 - 22:03)
it's still a good casual (22:03 - 22:08)
introduction to that style of game and i (22:06 - 22:10)
think (22:08 - 22:11)
i think there's a couple of things that (22:10 - 22:12)
i'm (22:11 - 22:15)
that i ran into like you've introduced a (22:12 - 22:18)
bunch of pokemon but (22:15 - 22:19)
there's really not a lot of difference (22:18 - 22:21)
between playing (22:19 - 22:24)
alola 9 tales as (22:21 - 22:26)
a ranged attacker (22:24 - 22:27)
and (22:26 - 22:29)
playing decidueye as a ranged attacker (22:27 - 22:31)
or playing gardevoir as a ranged (22:29 - 22:34)
attacker they do slightly different (22:31 - 22:37)
things but i don't think it makes enough (22:34 - 22:39)
that (22:37 - 22:39)
it's like a boon in a in a (22:39 - 22:44)
and a weakness because if you know how (22:42 - 22:46)
to play one type of all-rounder you can (22:44 - 22:48)
pretty much play them all because the (22:46 - 22:50)
gameplay isn't that different (22:48 - 22:53)
but also (22:50 - 22:54)
none of them start they don't start (22:53 - 22:56)
feeling unique (22:54 - 22:57)
like i think that's why people were (22:56 - 23:00)
excited about hoopa though (22:57 - 23:02)
i mean yeah hoopa's i don't even know (23:00 - 23:04)
who but i've seen people play hoop i'm (23:02 - 23:05)
like i don't understand the single thing (23:04 - 23:07)
you're doing (23:05 - 23:09)
none of what you're doing makes sense (23:07 - 23:11)
and maybe hoopa is like hey our (23:09 - 23:13)
characters need to be a little bit (23:11 - 23:15)
different (23:13 - 23:15)
because yeah like i i can i can play (23:17 - 23:20)
cramer ant and then i can go to (23:18 - 23:22)
blastoise and one's an attacker and (23:20 - 23:25)
one's a defender but they're (23:22 - 23:27)
like they're they're still pushing water (23:25 - 23:29)
in different directions like hey yeah (23:27 - 23:30)
it's (23:29 - 23:33)
i don't know i (23:30 - 23:33)
i i still don't really know how to feel (23:35 - 23:39)
about this game (23:37 - 23:42)
ultimately i i do think that (23:39 - 23:44)
they are beginning to hit that sort of (23:42 - 23:46)
moba toxicity (23:44 - 23:49)
bad player problem and i don't i hit (23:46 - 23:52)
that early on yeah like (23:49 - 23:55)
hiding the ability to report them (23:52 - 23:59)
making that so difficult doesn't (23:55 - 24:02)
help matters at all (23:59 - 24:03)
but do you think do you think it's just (24:02 - 24:04)
an illusion where you feel better when (24:03 - 24:06)
you report and like nothing actually (24:04 - 24:08)
happens well i mean there's times when (24:06 - 24:10)
like if i can say this person dropped i (24:08 - 24:12)
report them for dropping and the game (24:10 - 24:13)
goes yep i've confirmed that they (24:12 - 24:15)
dropped and i'm taking away (24:13 - 24:18)
points oh yeah yeah yeah that yeah like (24:15 - 24:20)
okay great i am (24:18 - 24:22)
justified in what i saw happening (24:20 - 24:24)
um and i feel like yeah i've done (24:22 - 24:27)
something that maybe (24:24 - 24:29)
will alert (24:27 - 24:31)
them and others to be like okay (24:29 - 24:32)
you've gone down on the ranking but the (24:31 - 24:35)
problem is i think (24:32 - 24:35)
since like even the good job menu is (24:36 - 24:40)
hard to find (24:38 - 24:42)
um like you can't go into that final (24:40 - 24:44)
screen and click on a person and get all (24:42 - 24:46)
the options anymore you have to go over (24:44 - 24:48)
next to next to the menu then get the (24:46 - 24:50)
right menu then click on the person (24:48 - 24:53)
yeah i forgot about that (24:50 - 24:55)
it makes it hard so if a bunch of people (24:53 - 24:57)
don't do it (24:55 - 24:59)
because now it is more difficult you (24:57 - 25:01)
have to really be like i want to make (24:59 - 25:02)
this game better (25:01 - 25:04)
and you are discouraging your player (25:02 - 25:07)
base from doing that easily so it (25:04 - 25:09)
doesn't happen so ultimately even though (25:07 - 25:12)
i did do it and like i would say half of (25:09 - 25:13)
them were like confirmed we've taken (25:12 - 25:17)
away the points i know that nobody else (25:13 - 25:19)
bothered to try to find how to do this (25:17 - 25:21)
because it was a pain for me but i'm (25:19 - 25:23)
like i am committed to trying to make (25:21 - 25:25)
this a better experience (25:23 - 25:26)
ariel's like just move on to the next (25:25 - 25:28)
match (25:26 - 25:31)
and it (25:28 - 25:33)
it doesn't improve (25:31 - 25:36)
anything like it is so hard to try to (25:33 - 25:38)
force change (25:36 - 25:39)
and (25:38 - 25:41)
by hiding it they've made it even harder (25:39 - 25:43)
to do it's like okay well even the (25:41 - 25:46)
company doesn't want this to get better (25:43 - 25:47)
they just want you to move on and (25:46 - 25:49)
hopefully your next set of people are (25:47 - 25:50)
better (25:49 - 25:51)
and (25:50 - 25:53)
it will never be better because the (25:51 - 25:54)
person that's the problem the people (25:53 - 25:57)
that just stop playing and quit don't (25:54 - 25:59)
get punished in any way (25:57 - 26:01)
like even in final fantasy you will get (25:59 - 26:03)
timed up for a while and people are like (26:01 - 26:05)
okay (26:03 - 26:07)
yeah and i have an unlimited block list (26:05 - 26:12)

i have not found enough yungas (35:21 - 35:26)
to evolve (35:25 - 35:28)
and i feel like (35:26 - 35:29)
oh you know you have to evolve them (35:28 - 35:31)
during the day right you can't evolve in (35:29 - 35:32)
the night (35:31 - 35:34)
i feel like that is yeah that's the (35:32 - 35:36)
thing and go you have to it has to be (35:34 - 35:38)
daylight to evolve (35:36 - 35:40)
but i don't even have the candies to (35:38 - 35:41)
involve what like i just (35:40 - 35:44)
they're not appearing around me on a (35:41 - 35:47)
regular basis really i've got a lot of (35:44 - 35:48)

one i get my collection challenge (36:08 - 36:12)
um (36:18 - 36:20)
i think this to me this launch is better (36:20 - 36:25)
than (36:23 - 36:25)
how they did gen six (36:25 - 36:30)
like it was easy to find the three (36:28 - 36:32)
starters they're i feel like they're (36:30 - 36:34)
they're spawning very very well (36:32 - 36:37)
[Music] (36:34 - 36:37)
it doesn't feel like the other spawns (36:38 - 36:43)
are are as terrible (36:40 - 36:43)
as a surfskit appears in my house (36:44 - 36:51)
there's nothing around me right now (36:47 - 36:51)
i don't know i i (36:54 - 36:57)
i'm pretty alright with pokemon go it's (36:58 - 37:03)
been it's it's been fine (37:00 - 37:03)
i mean it's fine it's always just fine (37:04 - 37:09)
i'm never super excited about go (37:07 - 37:12)
i enjoyed the johto tour a lot (37:09 - 37:14)
it was fine (37:12 - 37:17)
i'm looking forward to the community (37:14 - 37:19)
i (37:17 - 37:19)
am still not a huge fan of go battling (37:19 - 37:25)
that's its own problem (37:22 - 37:25)
there is there is a bunch of stuff (37:27 - 37:32)
regarding go badly battling they're (37:29 - 37:36)
calling it the interlude season (37:32 - 37:36)
and uh (37:37 - 37:41)
great great cup will happen from now (37:39 - 37:43)
until march 8th (37:41 - 37:44)
see here's the thing about go battling (37:43 - 37:48)
though like i only want to do great cup (37:44 - 37:50)
and it's like great cup march 1st (37:48 - 37:52)
through march 8th also the johto cup and (37:50 - 37:53)
then (37:52 - 37:56)
march 8th through the 15th it's ultra (37:53 - 37:57)
league and ultra premium classic like (37:56 - 37:59)
i'm out i'm no longer like what's the (37:57 - 38:00)
difference (37:59 - 38:03)
ultra league is 2500 cp great league is (38:00 - 38:06)
1500 cp (38:03 - 38:07)
so you start getting a lot of like (38:06 - 38:08)
legends (38:07 - 38:09)
um (38:08 - 38:11)
in ultra league and you start getting a (38:09 - 38:14)
lot of pokemon that like require (38:11 - 38:17)
the buddy boost (38:14 - 38:17)
so like some pokemon might cap out at (38:18 - 38:22)
like 2 300 so like you buddy boost it (38:19 - 38:23)
and then it's like (38:22 - 38:26)
2499 and all of a sudden the pokemon (38:23 - 38:27)
that was kind of bad is like really (38:26 - 38:29)
really good but you need that buddy (38:27 - 38:30)
boost stuff (38:29 - 38:31)
there's not i don't think there's like a (38:30 - 38:33)
single pokemon in great league that (38:31 - 38:38)
benefits the friendship buddy boost (38:33 - 38:38)
at all because (38:38 - 38:42)
of just how cp works and how most will (38:40 - 38:46)
go over that anyways (38:42 - 38:46)
there's like a new time research that (38:48 - 38:51)
keeps track of your battles but it gives (38:49 - 38:52)
like the worst amount of star like i (38:51 - 38:54)
don't know who made this (38:52 - 38:57)
timed research battle but it's like win (38:54 - 38:59)
a battle 100 stardust you're like why (38:57 - 39:01)
would (38:59 - 39:02)
i have (39:01 - 39:04)
staring at the sun (39:02 - 39:05)
and then there at one point it's like (39:04 - 39:07)
ways don't stare at the sun (39:05 - 39:10)
it's like 64 battles (39:07 - 39:13)
3 000 stardust and it's like (39:10 - 39:15)
what (39:13 - 39:17)
i mean if you like battling that's (39:15 - 39:18)
nothing (39:17 - 39:20)
but if you like battling that is (39:18 - 39:21)
actually literally nothing that's like a (39:20 - 39:24)
bad reward (39:21 - 39:24)
it's a really bad reward honestly (39:26 - 39:30)
anyways (39:28 - 39:32)
alola is here (39:30 - 39:34)
i'm (39:32 - 39:36)
i (39:34 - 39:36)
wouldn't be surprised if we get a pika (39:36 - 39:41)
pet community pretty soon like what else (39:39 - 39:44)
would they do (39:41 - 39:45)
i don't think they're i don't i think (39:44 - 39:48)
they're probably going to save (39:45 - 39:48)
litten (39:48 - 39:52)
well we haven't even gotten we haven't (39:50 - 39:53)
gotten croaky (39:52 - 39:55)
yeah (39:53 - 39:55)
i was going to say we haven't gotten (39:55 - 39:58)
those starters but those starters are (39:57 - 39:59)
what they're going to probably do for (39:58 - 40:01)
the summer right (39:59 - 40:04)
like we will probably get maybe kids (40:01 - 40:05)
maybe they've changed their mind about (40:04 - 40:07)
community day altogether and it's a (40:05 - 40:11)
whole different thing now (40:07 - 40:11)
i think they've been on autopilot for (40:17 - 40:21)
community for quite a while (40:19 - 40:23)
i just flipped the switch (40:21 - 40:24)
i mean do we think they're not going to (40:23 - 40:26)
do a starter at all in the season of (40:24 - 40:28)
alola (40:26 - 40:28)
until june 1st (40:29 - 40:32)
just like they didn't do a starter in (40:31 - 40:34)
the season of kalos do you think it's (40:32 - 40:35)
going to be like (40:34 - 40:39)
a lowland (40:35 - 40:39)
and regular grimer and alolan vulpix and (40:45 - 40:50)
regular vulpix yeah (40:48 - 40:54)
what about cubone and alolan cuba (40:50 - 40:56)
there's no (40:54 - 40:59)
i know it stinks but (40:56 - 40:59)
i want to be able to evolve into an (41:01 - 41:06)
alolan marowak and be happy about it (41:03 - 41:09)
what about kecleon community day (41:06 - 41:11)
it happened we just didn't know when it (41:09 - 41:12)
was and nobody saw it (41:11 - 41:15)
yeah (41:12 - 41:15)
uh all right well let's take a break one (41:15 - 41:19)
summer when everybody's like how is (41:17 - 41:22)

the privacy of your own home and steve (41:46 - 41:49)
would have no idea i just know but he's (41:47 - 41:52)
very influential that's the problem he (41:49 - 41:53)
is yes (41:52 - 41:55)
see i do most things (41:53 - 41:56)
that he (41:55 - 41:59)
says not to do and my life is golly (41:56 - 42:02)
you you have to save your rare candy for (41:59 - 42:04)
volcarona will (42:02 - 42:05)
there's they've never even announced (42:04 - 42:08)
volcarona but when they do you'll have (42:05 - 42:09)
the king (42:08 - 42:11)
they've moved on through (42:09 - 42:13)
multiple regions (42:11 - 42:15)
use them all to power up victini to (42:13 - 42:16)
super level yeah that's a good there you (42:15 - 42:18)
go anybody ever everybody knows that (42:16 - 42:20)
level 100 larvesta is much better than (42:18 - 42:25)
volca rhoda so it's true string shot (42:20 - 42:26)
all right let's take a break we got to (42:25 - 42:27)
talk about a robbery we got to talk (42:26 - 42:29)
about uh (42:27 - 42:32)
massive mass outbreaks so we will be (42:29 - 42:34)
right back (42:32 - 42:38)
and we are back from our break all right (42:34 - 42:41)
we did it we tried it (42:38 - 42:41)
massive mass outbreaks (42:43 - 42:49)
mmos finally came to pokemon (42:46 - 42:51)
do not (42:49 - 42:51)
i mean will have you tried these did you (42:56 - 42:59)
do those i (42:58 - 43:03)
started the research story but i have a (42:59 - 43:06)
particular issue with pokemon legends (43:03 - 43:07)
that (43:06 - 43:09)
i'm just about ready to throw my switch (43:07 - 43:10)
out the (43:09 - 43:12)
front door into the street and say (43:10 - 43:13)
actually i'm done with video games all (43:12 - 43:15)
together if this is how you're going to (43:13 - 43:16)
treat me (43:15 - 43:19)
what's your issue with legends (43:16 - 43:19)
no (43:22 - 43:24)
let me put it this way (43:25 - 43:30)
because you're going to get there before (43:28 - 43:32)
everybody else (43:30 - 43:34)
there is a gentleman (43:32 - 43:37)
standing at the front gate of jubalife (43:34 - 43:38)
city (43:37 - 43:39)
who wants to see (43:38 - 43:42)
a float soul a weasel (43:39 - 43:43)
that is over (43:42 - 43:45)
two foot eight (43:43 - 43:46)
four (43:45 - 43:47)
no (43:46 - 43:50)
oh yeah you're right yeah two eight (43:47 - 43:52)
or larger go in (43:50 - 43:56)
catch ten please weasel a day (43:52 - 43:59)
for weeks now (43:56 - 44:01)
and have not (43:59 - 44:02)
yet (44:01 - 44:05)
gotten one that was over two foot eight (44:02 - 44:07)
get good noob (44:05 - 44:10)
i am sick of this (44:07 - 44:13)
i i haven't found an alpha weasel (44:10 - 44:16)
i think they're on the (44:13 - 44:16)
i go in (44:17 - 44:22)
every day oh (44:18 - 44:22)
this research task (44:22 - 44:27)
and it will not let me (44:24 - 44:30)
maybe a massive mass outbreak of weasels (44:27 - 44:31)
will (44:30 - 44:32)
yeah oh yeah (44:31 - 44:34)
there you go (44:32 - 44:38)
that was a good transition too (44:34 - 44:40)
uh i have a (44:38 - 44:42)
i like (44:40 - 44:44)
the concept (44:42 - 44:47)
of massive mass outbreaks and i have fun (44:44 - 44:49)
with it (44:47 - 44:52)
but here's the big butt (44:49 - 44:52)
the games pokedex (44:54 - 44:57)
is not big enough to support what they (44:58 - 45:02)
are doing (45:00 - 45:02)
when i go into (45:03 - 45:08)
fairland highlands or whatever (45:05 - 45:09)
field (45:08 - 45:12)
yeah the fair land fair fair and i pay (45:09 - 45:17)
my five bit berry tax to the munchlax (45:12 - 45:20)
and four of my massive mass outbreaks (45:17 - 45:23)
are of the cadabra line (45:20 - 45:26)
i have no interest in cadabra (45:23 - 45:28)
i don't (45:26 - 45:31)
can there be in future pokemon games (45:28 - 45:33)
hear me out i know i know i know like oh (45:31 - 45:35)
steve's negative about the new feature (45:33 - 45:37)
hear me out though everyone's gonna (45:35 - 45:38)
agree with me (45:37 - 45:40)
is there a check box we can hit in (45:38 - 45:43)
future pokemon games that say like (45:40 - 45:45)
i'm interested in your game (45:43 - 45:48)
remove all the kanto pokemon can like (45:45 - 45:51)
can i just hit that trick (45:48 - 45:55)
we have learned there is no toggle so no (45:51 - 45:57)
i just (45:55 - 45:59)
and this this this is my personal (45:57 - 46:01)
problem doesn't apply to everyone but as (45:59 - 46:03)
somebody who had put a thousand hours (46:01 - 46:06)
into let's go as somebody who had shiny (46:03 - 46:08)
hunted a lot in prior game before let's (46:06 - 46:11)
go as somebody who played uh (46:08 - 46:15)
six years of pokemon go (46:11 - 46:18)
i i i have every single kanto shirt i (46:15 - 46:22)
have them all i i i just i (46:18 - 46:26)
and i think some of it is like (46:22 - 46:26)
like they know that i feel like there's (46:26 - 46:31)
not a coincidence of (46:28 - 46:35)
community day shinies and pokemon we've (46:31 - 46:36)
put into this game (46:35 - 46:40)
like spheel like like uh cadet like abra (46:36 - 46:44)
cadabra the tert wig chimchar like i (46:40 - 46:46)
just (46:44 - 46:47)
don't nee if you were featured in (46:46 - 46:51)
community i have 30 of you but you don't (46:47 - 46:53)
have them in gigantic balls (46:51 - 46:54)
that's true (46:53 - 46:56)
again this is this is a very me problem (46:54 - 46:59)
but i do (46:56 - 47:02)
like it is so cool to see like 12 (46:59 - 47:04)
different outbreaks (47:02 - 47:06)
and then when you when you pay the the (47:04 - 47:07)
berry tax sometimes i don't pay the (47:06 - 47:09)
barrier tax because i i get disappointed (47:07 - 47:11)
right off the bat (47:09 - 47:13)
but when you pay the berry tax and it's (47:11 - 47:15)
like oh four of these are a ponyta (47:13 - 47:18)
two of these are hapini another four are (47:15 - 47:20)
kadabra (47:18 - 47:22)
like we have one zarua (47:20 - 47:24)
i guess i'll do the zarua even though i (47:22 - 47:26)
have the shirt like like there's nothing (47:24 - 47:28)
i just don't think the pokedex is big (47:26 - 47:30)
enough and i think that you start to see (47:28 - 47:35)
that like this pokedex is pretty tiny (47:30 - 47:35)
or you're just playing the game too much (47:36 - 47:41)
i don't think so i don't i don't think i (47:38 - 47:43)
have it for a living i think yeah yeah (47:41 - 47:45)
yeah yeah i i do play a lot look it took (47:43 - 47:48)
me a full month to finish the pokedex (47:45 - 47:51)
and to beat the final person (47:48 - 47:53)
game gobbler (47:51 - 47:55)
i haven't done that yet i haven't even (47:53 - 47:58)
caught a weasel that's over (47:55 - 47:58)
where the (47:59 - 48:02)
game begins (48:00 - 48:04)
uh yeah i i (48:02 - 48:07)
i don't like that it's timed (48:04 - 48:10)
oh so that's what i do like (48:07 - 48:13)
i feel like (48:10 - 48:15)
i i do like i've already felt like (48:13 - 48:17)
there's just not enough pokemon in these (48:15 - 48:18)
areas (48:17 - 48:19)
to (48:18 - 48:20)
make this feel (48:19 - 48:22)
because i still feel like if you're (48:20 - 48:24)
trying to fill out the pokedex because (48:22 - 48:27)
you aren't getting ones that you need (48:24 - 48:28)
the fact that like seven of them are (48:27 - 48:31)
abra and none of them are still the ones (48:28 - 48:32)
that you're missing (48:31 - 48:36)
isn't like a great feeling (48:32 - 48:37)
um (48:36 - 48:40)
have you heard so you know you had your (48:37 - 48:42)
youtube about the (48:40 - 48:45)
save at camp go back to jubilee yep (48:42 - 48:47)
i am hearing a person that is no longer (48:45 - 48:50)
working correct (48:47 - 48:50)
[Music] (48:51 - 48:55)
so when they updated to daybreak (48:52 - 48:59)
and added the massive mass outbreaks (48:55 - 49:01)
uh they they had it where pretty much if (48:59 - 49:04)
you (49:01 - 49:04)
if you go back the thing is not the (49:05 - 49:09)
saving and resetting (49:07 - 49:11)
it's the initially going back into juba (49:09 - 49:13)
life (49:11 - 49:16)
will reset the outbreaks (49:13 - 49:17)
that are there (49:16 - 49:20)
so like if you were doing a weasel (49:17 - 49:22)
outbreak (49:20 - 49:24)
and a shiny weasel popped up and you (49:22 - 49:27)
saved the game and then you and then you (49:24 - 49:29)
failed the weasel so you relaunched the (49:27 - 49:30)
game (49:29 - 49:31)
it's not going to remove the outbreak (49:30 - 49:33)
you'll still be in it (49:31 - 49:35)
granted if (49:33 - 49:37)
like my video says if there are (49:35 - 49:39)
three or less weasel (49:37 - 49:41)
and one is shiny and you save and reset (49:39 - 49:43)
it will force fail the outbreak because (49:41 - 49:46)
there's not four there's three (49:43 - 49:47)
so don't do that (49:46 - 49:49)
um (49:47 - 49:51)
but now if you if you save and camp (49:49 - 49:54)
check the weasels there's no shiny you (49:51 - 49:55)
then (49:54 - 49:58)
um restart the game and then go through (49:55 - 50:00)
juba life and come back out (49:58 - 50:01)
it's very very very very very likely (50:00 - 50:03)
that the outbreak just (50:01 - 50:06)
won't appear anymore (50:03 - 50:06)
which is like (50:06 - 50:09)
if this is how they want us to play (50:10 - 50:14)
their game i understand (50:12 - 50:18)
they're i i see two sides right i think (50:14 - 50:21)
if if you're specifically looking for (50:18 - 50:23)
like a hassuian growlithe (50:21 - 50:25)
like that's the shiny you want (50:23 - 50:28)
and once you find the outbreak you you (50:25 - 50:30)
prior to this update you could save you (50:28 - 50:32)
could grind it out eventually you'll get (50:30 - 50:34)
your shiny growlithe (50:32 - 50:35)
and then you're (50:34 - 50:37)
you did it right (50:35 - 50:40)
same for your gumi or your zarua or (50:37 - 50:43)
whatever else you're looking for (50:40 - 50:43)
there was a certain point for me (50:43 - 50:48)
that (50:46 - 50:48)
i just didn't do that anymore i was like (50:49 - 50:52)
you know what i'm just gonna check this (50:50 - 50:54)
out break if it's not shiny i got other (50:52 - 50:56)
things to do in this game i'll i'll (50:54 - 50:59)
worry about hunting it later (50:56 - 50:59)
and i think that's how they want you to (51:00 - 51:04)
play i mean i think that's kind of clear (51:02 - 51:05)
like they don't want you to say yeah (51:04 - 51:07)
reset (51:05 - 51:09)
like it was yeah yeah kind of kind of (51:07 - 51:11)
clear in in the sword and shield they (51:09 - 51:13)
didn't want you to reset for those (51:11 - 51:14)
starters they wanted you to pick it and (51:13 - 51:18)
move on like go play our game (51:14 - 51:18)
so the first side i see is like i don't (51:20 - 51:23)
know (51:22 - 51:25)
they spent the 60 dollars let them play (51:23 - 51:26)
the game however they want to play the (51:25 - 51:28)
game yep (51:26 - 51:31)
the other part is (51:28 - 51:31)
i don't think it's really that much more (51:32 - 51:37)
difficult like it's not like there (51:35 - 51:41)
aren't other ways to get the growlithe (51:37 - 51:44)
like you can you can get your research (51:41 - 51:46)
level to max and there are places where (51:44 - 51:48)
growlithe spawns (51:46 - 51:51)
and while you might not find (51:48 - 51:53)
a growlithe like so you don't even need (51:51 - 51:55)
an outbreak you just go to the top of (51:53 - 51:56)
the mountain in cobalt there's like five (51:55 - 51:58)
of them up there you could check them if (51:56 - 51:59)
they're not shiny just fly back do it (51:58 - 52:00)
again like they're always gonna be up (51:59 - 52:01)
there (52:00 - 52:05)
they're never not gonna be up there (52:01 - 52:05)
but (52:08 - 52:11)
with massive mass outbreaks the (52:10 - 52:13)
likelihood of you finding a relative is (52:11 - 52:14)
actually pretty high like i feel like (52:13 - 52:16)
every time i go to (52:14 - 52:17)
the (52:16 - 52:19)
highland field lens (52:17 - 52:22)
one of them is always a growlithe (52:19 - 52:23)
so (52:22 - 52:25)
it's it's like they they were like we (52:23 - 52:27)
don't want you to reset this but also (52:25 - 52:28)
here's a bunch of new outbreaks and (52:27 - 52:31)
there's like 12 of them and pick which (52:28 - 52:33)
one you want and you're on a time limit (52:31 - 52:34)
which is why i think i like the time (52:33 - 52:35)
limit (52:34 - 52:37)
i think if they didn't instill a time (52:35 - 52:38)
limit (52:37 - 52:41)
because because those have increased (52:38 - 52:43)
shiny odds and they're not as increased (52:41 - 52:44)
as the (52:43 - 52:45)
original (52:44 - 52:48)
ones i feel like some people would would (52:45 - 52:50)
be like i have to check all of them (52:48 - 52:53)
before i go back (52:50 - 52:55)
okay (52:53 - 52:55)
but and then they're not playing the (52:56 - 53:00)
game again but they are playing the game (52:57 - 53:02)
they are playing the game but i but have (53:00 - 53:04)
you done some of these they're so (53:02 - 53:06)
resource intensive (53:04 - 53:08)
and the thing is like (53:06 - 53:09)
because they're i i think what i like (53:08 - 53:12)
about them is they're forcing you to (53:09 - 53:14)
it's kind of like the the difference (53:12 - 53:16)
between like max raids and then dynamax (53:14 - 53:18)
adventure like same core concept at the (53:16 - 53:19)
end of the day (53:18 - 53:21)
but they're forcing you to play it in a (53:19 - 53:22)
different way and i think that's what i (53:21 - 53:24)
like like (53:22 - 53:25)
here's 12 of them (53:24 - 53:27)
you have 10 minutes (53:25 - 53:28)
what like (53:27 - 53:30)
you have to come up with a plan (53:28 - 53:32)
and you can't just (53:30 - 53:34)
sit on the edge of the map and throw (53:32 - 53:36)
feather balls and like wait for them to (53:34 - 53:37)
calm down and throw feather balls (53:36 - 53:39)
because you'll run out of time (53:37 - 53:40)
so it kind of forces you to be like a (53:39 - 53:42)
little bit more aggressive or if you're (53:40 - 53:44)
not that aggressive type of person to (53:42 - 53:46)
like kind of pick and choose (53:44 - 53:48)
like you could go i'm just going to fly (53:46 - 53:49)
over each and every one of them and see (53:48 - 53:51)
if there's a shiny or (53:49 - 53:53)
i'm going to ignore all of them and just (53:51 - 53:55)
focus on the zarua one because the zero (53:53 - 53:56)
one has a little star (53:55 - 53:58)
which means once you clear it out a new (53:56 - 54:00)
one will spawn in and those will (53:58 - 54:01)
probably be alphas (54:00 - 54:04)
um or i'm going to like check this (54:01 - 54:06)
sphere (54:04 - 54:07)
and then just clear out the first wave (54:06 - 54:09)
and then go over here and check this man (54:07 - 54:10)
tike and clear out this first wave and (54:09 - 54:12)
then like end with the (54:10 - 54:14)
uh hissuing growlithe because it has the (54:12 - 54:16)
star like i think it just (54:14 - 54:19)
it gives you like a thought process (54:16 - 54:20)
or like a strategy that (54:19 - 54:22)
i think some people were maybe missing (54:20 - 54:24)
of like (54:22 - 54:26)
i don't know what to do like what am i (54:24 - 54:27)
doing right now am i just waiting for an (54:26 - 54:30)
outbreak am i (54:27 - 54:30)
i don't know i i like that it's doing (54:32 - 54:36)
that and i like that it's it's it's 10 (54:34 - 54:38)
minutes and it gives you the focus and (54:36 - 54:39)
then at the end of 10 minutes you're (54:38 - 54:42)
done like you kind of (54:39 - 54:42)
i i would imagine that it's helpful for (54:44 - 54:47)
people who (54:46 - 54:49)
struggle to make their own (54:47 - 54:51)
tasks (54:49 - 54:53)
yes (54:51 - 54:55)
i but i mean that's not going to change (54:53 - 54:56)
i just think there's so little to do (54:55 - 54:59)
post game (54:56 - 55:01)
that when you've introduced something (54:59 - 55:02)
new and you're like and here's an (55:01 - 55:05)
artificial time limit (55:02 - 55:06)
yeah but when you when you do the 10 (55:05 - 55:08)
minutes (55:06 - 55:09)
and you go back you're almost always (55:08 - 55:11)
gonna have another one (55:09 - 55:13)
uh that has not been my (55:11 - 55:16)
oh my gosh situation so much (55:13 - 55:20)
i i see them very rarely (55:16 - 55:23)
like i think there's only i think i i (55:20 - 55:23)
think (55:23 - 55:25)
for me (55:23 - 55:27)
because i i've done such a ha i've done (55:25 - 55:29)
so many of them now i've gone through (55:27 - 55:30)
the gate in juba life and there's like (55:29 - 55:32)
nothing (55:30 - 55:33)
and then i just go back into town and go (55:32 - 55:35)
back out and then there there's i've (55:33 - 55:37)
never had to do it twice (55:35 - 55:39)
i'll go through that i'll go through the (55:37 - 55:40)
gate of jul jubal if nothing's there (55:39 - 55:42)
i'll go to the the field lens i come (55:40 - 55:44)
back i go back through and now i have (55:42 - 55:45)
like two of them (55:44 - 55:47)
i've never had to do it twice like i (55:45 - 55:48)
feel like i get so many i don't know if (55:47 - 55:50)
that's because i'm like rank 10 (55:48 - 55:52)
in the decks i don't know if that's i (55:50 - 55:54)
don't know what (55:52 - 55:56)
triggers that how many stars do you have (55:54 - 55:59)
the the 10 the 10 no the 10 stars 10 (55:56 - 56:03)
stars g (55:59 - 56:03)
i mean it definitely (56:06 - 56:10)
i it's definitely better (56:08 - 56:12)
so like on one hand it's like we can't (56:10 - 56:15)
reset for outbreaks like we used to (56:12 - 56:17)
on the other hand i no longer have to (56:15 - 56:20)
just sit there for 35 minutes and wait (56:17 - 56:23)
for a distortion to pop up to hopefully (56:20 - 56:25)
maybe get a rowlet (56:23 - 56:28)
oh yeah i mean i like massive outbreaks (56:25 - 56:29)
because they've added (56:28 - 56:32)
ways to find them if you get lucky (56:29 - 56:34)
i think (56:32 - 56:34)
i think the timeline feels arbitrary and (56:34 - 56:38)
weird (56:36 - 56:40)
and mostly (56:38 - 56:45)
i i i tend to not like it when (56:40 - 56:48)
you can feel the developers make a (56:45 - 56:49)
change because they're like play our (56:48 - 56:52)
game no not that way (56:49 - 56:54)
i i don't like it when they do a big (56:52 - 56:55)
change they're gonna offer all these (56:54 - 56:57)
things and then it's clear that they (56:55 - 56:58)
were just like well we don't like how (56:57 - 57:00)
you're playing your game (56:58 - 57:03)
i i don't like feeling that in a game (57:00 - 57:04)
at all (57:03 - 57:06)
um and i feel that with massive (57:04 - 57:09)
outbreaks and the time limit and the the (57:06 - 57:12)
rareness of the berry that they (57:09 - 57:14)
introduced it's just like i don't know (57:12 - 57:15)
what you're i don't know what you're (57:14 - 57:20)
doing here other than saying (57:15 - 57:20)
we only want you to play this way (57:20 - 57:24)
and this is the way that we've decided (57:22 - 57:26)
that that's going to be and we're going (57:24 - 57:27)
to take away the ways that you were (57:26 - 57:29)
doing it before (57:27 - 57:31)
because reasons (57:29 - 57:32)
i think (57:31 - 57:34)
we don't want our players to turn on and (57:32 - 57:38)
off for video games pretty good reason (57:34 - 57:38)
why (57:39 - 57:44)
i mean people are doing it post game (57:41 - 57:46)
and (57:44 - 57:47)
we're doing it for everything like there (57:46 - 57:49)
are certain things that you you you had (57:47 - 57:51)
to get to certain spots in the game to (57:49 - 57:53)
get it and people are going in and out (57:51 - 57:55)
of like do you really think then that (57:53 - 57:57)
their gameplay was go to a land (57:55 - 57:58)
immediately turn around go back to (57:57 - 58:00)
jubalife to see what spawned go into a (57:58 - 58:02)
land immediately turn back to juba life (58:00 - 58:03)
and is that the gameplay that they (58:02 - 58:05)
wanted because that's the gameplay that (58:03 - 58:06)
they're encouraging (58:05 - 58:08)
i mean that seems that seems like we (58:06 - 58:10)
just don't want you to turn off our game (58:08 - 58:12)
but we do want you to run between a gate (58:10 - 58:14)
50 times until you get the thing that (58:12 - 58:16)
you want doesn't seem like an (58:14 - 58:18)
improvement (58:16 - 58:20)
by any stretch of the imagination (58:18 - 58:22)
i think i think the problem i mean like (58:20 - 58:25)
people are always going to like min max (58:22 - 58:26)
people are always going to like try to (58:25 - 58:28)
find like the most efficient way to do (58:26 - 58:30)
something (58:28 - 58:31)
i just can't think of like another game (58:30 - 58:34)
series where you you you power off your (58:31 - 58:37)
game over and over to get something done (58:34 - 58:39)
like even in animal crossing when you're (58:37 - 58:40)
villager hunting (58:39 - 58:42)
like the game (58:40 - 58:44)
force saves (58:42 - 58:45)
through like you you have to like grind (58:44 - 58:48)
out those tickets and (58:45 - 58:48)
but you don't like reset to get your (58:49 - 58:53)
like tickets back because like the the (58:51 - 58:55)
correct villager wasn't on there like (58:53 - 58:57)
i can't think of a mario game where (58:55 - 58:58)
you're (58:57 - 59:00)
turning it off and turning it back on (58:58 - 59:02)
well i mean there's not a lot of games (59:00 - 59:04)
that have a collection aspect that are (59:02 - 59:07)
limited resources (59:04 - 59:10)
i mean there are things like there are (59:07 - 59:11)
plenty of (59:10 - 59:14)
people who ran a dungeon in one of the (59:11 - 59:16)
older final fantasy games like it didn't (59:14 - 59:17)
drop so i'm (59:16 - 59:19)
resetting because i need to run that (59:17 - 59:21)
again because that was my one shot like (59:19 - 59:23)
they've gotten rid of a lot of those (59:21 - 59:24)
because (59:23 - 59:27)
they realize that isn't (59:24 - 59:29)
necessarily fun (59:27 - 59:30)
but (59:29 - 59:33)
also there's a one once you get it and (59:30 - 59:35)
you're done sort of a thing it's it is a (59:33 - 59:40)
unique pokemon experience that they (59:35 - 59:40)
have encouraged this behavior and (59:40 - 59:45)
i hate to say this greg because it only (59:45 - 59:50)
it only fuels your fire (59:47 - 59:52)
here we go but are are we getting close (59:50 - 59:55)
to the fact that (59:52 - 59:55)
there might be a possibility where (59:56 - 60:03)
autosave cannot be turned off absolutely (59:58 - 60:05)
and i say that because this specific (60:03 - 60:08)
game is the first pokemon game where (60:05 - 60:10)
there's an option that says like (60:08 - 60:13)
automatically connect me to online (60:10 - 60:15)
and then automatically what is the other (60:13 - 60:16)
one (60:15 - 60:18)
it's like automatically connecting me to (60:16 - 60:19)
online and then the other one is like (60:18 - 60:22)
always keep me online i think yeah and (60:19 - 60:24)
that's for the bag stuff (60:22 - 60:26)
yep for the satchels for the satchels (60:24 - 60:28)
yeah and i think the satchels is great i (60:26 - 60:31)
think i think it is one of the better (60:28 - 60:33)
like for a game without multiplayer it (60:31 - 60:35)
it does feel (60:33 - 60:37)
i don't know why maybe it's just me but (60:35 - 60:38)
like when i'm on the map and i finish my (60:37 - 60:40)
mass mass outbreaks before i go back i'm (60:38 - 60:42)
like well i can grab the satchel (60:40 - 60:44)
and the satchel's on the way oh and i (60:42 - 60:46)
should like there's just two i'll just (60:44 - 60:48)
grab them all right (60:46 - 60:49)
peaceful like i spend a lot of time (60:48 - 60:51)
where i'm like i don't interact with (60:49 - 60:52)
anything else in this game but i just (60:51 - 60:54)
want to go get people satchels like it (60:52 - 60:57)
is a it is a simple calming (60:54 - 61:00)
definitive (60:57 - 61:02)
goal that i can fly around and and i (61:00 - 61:04)
feel like i'm helping other people in (61:02 - 61:06)
the game like that is an enjoyable (61:04 - 61:08)
experience (61:06 - 61:10)
but are we getting to a point where (61:08 - 61:11)
they're like yeah you can't turn off (61:10 - 61:13)
autosave because we don't want you doing (61:11 - 61:16)
this absolutely and i feel like (61:13 - 61:20)
that is a better solution (61:16 - 61:20)
than than what we have right now (61:20 - 61:25)
i i mean my i'm also i will say this (61:34 - 61:40)
because of tick tock i am also on just (61:37 - 61:42)
drop the shiny rates (61:40 - 61:44)
at this point like just drop them to one (61:42 - 61:46)
in 500 as a start (61:44 - 61:48)
because it's still 500 and that's a lot (61:46 - 61:50)
no i think i think the shiny rates are (61:48 - 61:52)
fine and i think i i think that's like a (61:50 - 61:54)
different conversation of (61:52 - 61:56)
you ha you have you have one core (61:54 - 61:58)
audience being like (61:56 - 62:01)
shinies are too easy now (61:58 - 62:04)
and then you have another i strongly am (62:01 - 62:05)
in that they should start getting easier (62:04 - 62:08)
because i have started to see more (62:05 - 62:10)
weird (62:08 - 62:12)
gatekeepy shinies are useless like (62:10 - 62:15)
they've the the selling point of shinies (62:12 - 62:17)
is that they're useless (62:15 - 62:19)
that is okay that is the prime feature (62:17 - 62:20)
this is this is the difference though (62:19 - 62:22)
but they did make incredibly rare (62:20 - 62:24)
shinies and people are just too (62:22 - 62:27)
excuse my language they're just too dumb (62:24 - 62:29)
to see them (62:27 - 62:31)
like okay so you ha you have one core (62:29 - 62:32)
audience that are like shinies are too (62:31 - 62:35)
easy these are these are people that um (62:32 - 62:37)
that like pride themselves that they (62:35 - 62:39)
they took 80 hours to find a single (62:37 - 62:40)
shiny these are the people that like (62:39 - 62:43)
don't like the shiny arm charm these are (62:40 - 62:45)
the people that like think that like (62:43 - 62:46)
let's go pikachu or some of these method (62:45 - 62:48)
hunts really like ruined it for them (62:46 - 62:50)
right there's like a gatekeeping nature (62:48 - 62:52)
to them yeah and then there's it there's (62:50 - 62:54)
a whole other audience (62:52 - 62:56)
that and i and i see some of these (62:54 - 62:59)
people obviously my my vision of all the (62:56 - 63:00)
pokemon fans are limited to my own (62:59 - 63:02)
twitch channel but you know when you (63:00 - 63:03)
have a bunch of people being like i've (63:02 - 63:05)
played this game just as long as (63:03 - 63:06)
everyone else here i haven't gotten a (63:05 - 63:08)
single shiny like is my game broken like (63:06 - 63:11)
there are tons of people that have done (63:08 - 63:12)
that like my wife (63:11 - 63:15)
um she's 40 hours in she's never she (63:12 - 63:17)
hasn't seen a shiny doesn't mean she (63:15 - 63:18)
hasn't had a great time with legends (63:17 - 63:20)
she's she really really likes legends (63:18 - 63:22)
and and legends solidified that she will (63:20 - 63:25)
never go back to bdsp um and i don't (63:22 - 63:26)
blame her (63:25 - 63:29)
but (63:26 - 63:29)
i think in the sense of like (63:30 - 63:36)
if you are specifically (63:34 - 63:39)
they they have created um and i want to (63:36 - 63:42)
say this was maybe like i think sun and (63:39 - 63:44)
moon was kind of the big point of this (63:42 - 63:47)
they have created a method they have (63:44 - 63:49)
created methods that have made it easier (63:47 - 63:51)
to get shinies for people who want to (63:49 - 63:54)
like get a shiny like i want to get i've (63:51 - 63:56)
never gotten a shiny i want to get a (63:54 - 63:59)
shiny execute in sun and moon this is (63:56 - 64:01)
the thing i have to do to get it (63:59 - 64:04)
or in let's go i want to get a shiny (64:01 - 64:06)
ekans i'm going to keep catching atkins (64:04 - 64:07)
that's what they told me to do and then (64:06 - 64:09)
a shiny eckens will pop up right they've (64:07 - 64:11)
created a method to do that and in (64:09 - 64:15)
legends they created a method for rare (64:11 - 64:18)
shiny pokemon they were alpha pokemon i (64:15 - 64:23)
want an alpha shiny zarua that is really (64:18 - 64:24)
hard to get (64:23 - 64:27)
even if you're doing the methods so they (64:24 - 64:30)
they have satisfied both people it's (64:27 - 64:32)
just the people that are gatekeeping (64:30 - 64:35)
refuse to see that and they just general (64:32 - 64:37)
blanket statement over they did this in (64:35 - 64:40)
sword and shield and again those people (64:37 - 64:43)
refuse to look at it so if in sword and (64:40 - 64:46)
shield you could you could masuda method (64:43 - 64:48)
right i'm not talking about the dumb (64:46 - 64:49)
stars i'm not talking about squares and (64:48 - 64:51)
saying and whatever (64:49 - 64:53)
sparkles (64:51 - 64:56)
i'm not talking about that stuff (64:53 - 64:57)
in sword and shield they introduced (64:56 - 64:58)
marks (64:57 - 65:00)
and they introduced different levels of (64:58 - 65:03)
rarity on the marks so let's let's just (65:00 - 65:06)
say it was you you caught the 500 (65:03 - 65:08)
pokemon it was a one and i think if i (65:06 - 65:10)
think if you catch the 500 pokemon (65:08 - 65:11)
and then you get the brilliant it's like (65:10 - 65:14)
a one in 555 chance of it being shiny (65:11 - 65:16)
right they increase the odds otherwise (65:14 - 65:19)
with the otherwise it's one in 1365 and (65:16 - 65:20)
if you don't have the charm it's one in (65:19 - 65:22)
four thousand so (65:20 - 65:24)
if you got a shiny (65:22 - 65:26)
in sword and shield and it (65:24 - 65:28)
great you got a shiny (65:26 - 65:31)
but you could also get a shiny with a (65:28 - 65:33)
mark but you could also get a shiny (65:31 - 65:36)
with a rare mark a personality mark you (65:33 - 65:38)
could also get a shiny with a one in a (65:36 - 65:40)
thousand chance of it having a mark like (65:38 - 65:42)
they created (65:40 - 65:46)
something that shiny hunters wanted (65:42 - 65:47)
rarer chinese (65:46 - 65:50)
a marked shiny is significantly more (65:47 - 65:51)
rare than (65:50 - 65:53)
uh (65:51 - 65:54)
you know your your 30 squirtles from (65:53 - 65:57)
comedian day your 30 squirrels from (65:54 - 65:58)
community don't have that mark (65:57 - 66:00)
and at the end of the somebody might be (65:58 - 66:02)
like well i don't care about marx (66:00 - 66:04)
you're the one arguing about the (66:02 - 66:06)
rareness of a slightly different colored (66:04 - 66:08)
pokemon and you want something to be (66:06 - 66:10)
more rare they gave it to you you're (66:08 - 66:12)
refusing to see it (66:10 - 66:14)
you can't that's when i put out my (66:12 - 66:16)
pokemon in the pokemon battle nobody (66:14 - 66:19)
sees that mark when you select the mark (66:16 - 66:21)
it will come out and it will say like (66:19 - 66:22)
kramer ant the peckish (66:21 - 66:24)
it will it will show to people that you (66:22 - 66:28)
do have a mark on it (66:24 - 66:29)
my thing is (66:28 - 66:31)
i think alphas work more because they (66:29 - 66:34)
are visual right like when yeah (66:31 - 66:36)
when you see that it's bigger in the (66:34 - 66:38)
wild it is a more exciting thing versus (66:36 - 66:40)
you have to catch the shiny and then (66:38 - 66:45)
check if it has a mark on it but for me (66:40 - 66:46)
that was a great feeling right like oh (66:45 - 66:48)
my gosh i got shiny does it have a mark (66:46 - 66:49)
does it have a mark (66:48 - 66:50)
uh it doesn't have a mark still exciting (66:49 - 66:52)
that we got this shiny but (66:50 - 66:53)
they (66:52 - 66:55)
i think they've done a really good job (66:53 - 66:58)
at making shiny stuff more accessible (66:55 - 67:00)
and then giving those hardcore people (66:58 - 67:02)
something really rare to hunt for (67:00 - 67:04)
whether that's alpha whether that's marx (67:02 - 67:06)
but those hardcore people are just so (67:04 - 67:09)
clouded by their anger that they that (67:06 - 67:10)
they're just going to like yell at (67:09 - 67:12)
everyone else because they're not (67:10 - 67:15)
satisfied i just think at this point (67:12 - 67:18)
the regular old shiny odds should be (67:15 - 67:19)
dropped (67:18 - 67:20)
just (67:19 - 67:22)
to help sort of hammer home (67:20 - 67:25)
that the point of these shinies is that (67:22 - 67:28)
they're pretty they don't need to have a (67:25 - 67:29)
use (67:28 - 67:31)
they you the fact that you spent 80 (67:29 - 67:32)
hours (67:31 - 67:35)
and somebody happened to stumble across (67:32 - 67:37)
it in the like (67:35 - 67:40)
the idea of time spent is more (67:37 - 67:43)
legitimate needs to die (67:40 - 67:44)
well and (67:43 - 67:46)
and we are they are lowering it every (67:44 - 67:49)
time i'm like just lower it to 1 in 500. (67:46 - 67:51)
just make it so that (67:49 - 67:53)
people who have never seen it (67:51 - 67:54)
have (67:53 - 67:57)
have a very good chance of having that (67:54 - 67:59)
exciting moment in your game (67:57 - 68:01)
and you have all these other ways to (67:59 - 68:03)
make things more rare so if you want to (68:01 - 68:05)
be gatekeepy about it only counts if (68:03 - 68:09)
it's alpha give them that but (68:05 - 68:11)
we are getting to the point because of (68:09 - 68:13)
pokemon go which i think (68:11 - 68:15)
i love that go made community days and (68:13 - 68:17)
made people like have to reassess how (68:15 - 68:19)
they feel about chinese and the fact (68:17 - 68:21)
there's a bunch of people who are super (68:19 - 68:23)
super salty about it i think we need to (68:21 - 68:25)
lean they need to lean (68:23 - 68:28)
much harder into that trend (68:25 - 68:30)
also did this right yeah they have you (68:28 - 68:32)
you you it's very easy to get a shiny (68:30 - 68:33)
squirtle (68:32 - 68:35)
if you played the three hours it was (68:33 - 68:37)
available now (68:35 - 68:39)
good luck finding a shiny square i don't (68:37 - 68:40)
even think squirtle's spawning right now (68:39 - 68:41)
so good luck like (68:40 - 68:43)
but like pokemon go did the same thing (68:41 - 68:45)
right yeah very easy to find (68:43 - 68:48)
shiny during community day now we put a (68:45 - 68:52)
hat on it and it is not easy to find (68:48 - 68:54)
and it's the same as like (68:52 - 68:56)
shinies and then shinies with marks (68:54 - 68:59)
shinies or alpha shinies like they they (68:56 - 69:03)
have they they have really i think (68:59 - 69:06)
made chinese accessible to people and (69:03 - 69:09)
made them rare enough where when you (69:06 - 69:12)
find a shiny that you get excited and we (69:09 - 69:13)
see this all the time that people still (69:12 - 69:15)
get excited during communion days (69:13 - 69:17)
communities are still successful because (69:15 - 69:18)
it's still fun to go out and find these (69:17 - 69:21)
shiny pokemon but then they have made (69:18 - 69:24)
rarer shinies alphas marks (69:21 - 69:26)
pokemon with hats (69:24 - 69:28)
um and i don't think (69:26 - 69:30)
dropping the shiny rate (69:28 - 69:32)
will change (69:30 - 69:33)
the complaints because the complaints (69:32 - 69:35)
are coming from people that are super (69:33 - 69:37)
gatekeepy and they need to realize (69:35 - 69:38)
that (69:37 - 69:41)
they have done these rarer things for (69:38 - 69:44)
you you're just refusing to accept them (69:41 - 69:45)
because (69:44 - 69:49)
you're uneducated or because (69:45 - 69:49)
you (69:49 - 69:52)
you're stuck in your ways or because (69:49 - 69:55)
like you refuse to see that like that (69:52 - 69:58)
these are truly like actually rare (69:55 - 70:00)
i'm just saying i want them to lean into (69:58 - 70:03)
it harder so those people get more angry (70:00 - 70:05)
and then quit the series and i never (70:03 - 70:06)
have to deal with them hey they (70:05 - 70:08)
increased the chinese plus two to plus (70:06 - 70:10)
three (70:08 - 70:10)
i've i have always been an advocate of (70:14 - 70:20)
video games rewarding you for your time (70:17 - 70:23)
so the fact that both sword and shield (70:20 - 70:24)
and (70:23 - 70:27)
legends are like the more you catch or (70:24 - 70:29)
do for a specific pokemon the more it (70:27 - 70:32)
increases the shiny for that pokemon (70:29 - 70:33)
um (70:32 - 70:34)
i think that's great i think there are (70:33 - 70:37)
people out there that like (70:34 - 70:38)
they care about shinies but they care (70:37 - 70:40)
about shinies for specific pokemon like (70:38 - 70:42)
i met somebody that was like i'm done (70:40 - 70:43)
with legends and this was after two (70:42 - 70:44)
weeks and i was like you're done with (70:43 - 70:46)
legends they're like (70:44 - 70:48)
i completed the pokedex i caught arceus (70:46 - 70:50)
i shiny hunted the five pokemon i cared (70:48 - 70:52)
about there's nothing for more for me to (70:50 - 70:54)
do because the default was like just (70:52 - 70:56)
shiny hunt and he was like i don't i (70:54 - 70:59)
don't i don't care about like shiny bd (70:56 - 71:00)
like i don't care like i i wanted (70:59 - 71:02)
chinese aru i got it i wanted shiny (71:00 - 71:04)
growlithe i got it (71:02 - 71:06)
i got the other three i wanted (71:04 - 71:08)
why would i shiny on pokemon i don't (71:06 - 71:10)
care i was like i respect that like (71:08 - 71:10)
that's (71:10 - 71:11)
yeah (71:10 - 71:13)
that's how i feel about canto like i (71:11 - 71:15)
don't need to do (71:13 - 71:17)
any kadabras (71:15 - 71:19)
i just don't (71:17 - 71:20)
like (71:19 - 71:22)
yeah sure it's a cadet like even before (71:20 - 71:25)
they like patched the daybreak stuff (71:22 - 71:27)
if a cadaver popped up i was like i have (71:25 - 71:29)
zero interest and yeah you're right it (71:27 - 71:31)
could have it could be shiny right when (71:29 - 71:33)
i get there it has increased shiny odds (71:31 - 71:35)
i understand i just don't care i just i (71:33 - 71:37)
just don't need it (71:35 - 71:39)
i got other things to do (71:37 - 71:41)
i gotta get more sticky gloss i just (71:39 - 71:43)
want (71:41 - 71:43)
outbreaks (71:44 - 71:48)
with a perfect thing to be 125 like a (71:45 - 71:49)
community today that's all i'm saying (71:48 - 71:52)
just really lean into it really make (71:49 - 71:55)
those people blow a gasket (71:52 - 71:58)
and give up to go find whatever gun and (71:55 - 72:01)
destiny they care about now (71:58 - 72:04)
i saw a destiny 2 trailer and i'm like (72:01 - 72:05)
this looks good (72:04 - 72:07)
and then it said destiny 2 at the end (72:05 - 72:09)
i'm like i'm out (72:07 - 72:11)
now destiny's good um (72:09 - 72:14)
this is why i always hated the uh (72:11 - 72:15)
the like (72:14 - 72:18)
the phases that's like a common term in (72:15 - 72:20)
in shiny hunting they're like i phased (72:18 - 72:23)
five times i was like what does that (72:20 - 72:24)
mean (72:23 - 72:26)
what does that mean okay so (72:24 - 72:28)
how this started i'll give you a little (72:26 - 72:29)
i'll give you a little history lesson on (72:28 - 72:32)
chinese there's like a a youtube video (72:29 - 72:33)
out there (72:32 - 72:35)
is this the thing where they caught a (72:33 - 72:37)
different one and (72:35 - 72:41)
yeah oh that is so ugh okay okay so so (72:37 - 72:43)
here i'll give you a little history give (72:41 - 72:45)
you a little history lesson of how (72:43 - 72:48)
silly shiny hunting can be um i don't (72:45 - 72:49)
remember the exact youtube video i'm (72:48 - 72:50)
just going to paraphrase you get the (72:49 - 72:52)
gist of it there's like a there's like a (72:50 - 72:54)
youtube video out there where a guy goes (72:52 - 72:56)
like i want a hundred thousand (72:54 - 73:00)
encounters for a not to a shiny not too (72:56 - 73:02)
and when you see the title and the the (73:00 - 73:04)
the video you're like uh you have the (73:02 - 73:07)
worst shiny luck ever oh my gosh i feel (73:04 - 73:11)
so bad for you how did you go so long (73:07 - 73:14)
for a hundred thousand encounters (73:11 - 73:17)
so this is the here's what happened (73:14 - 73:18)
he (73:17 - 73:19)
this this person i shouldn't say he i (73:18 - 73:22)
actually i don't know uh they (73:19 - 73:23)
they (73:22 - 73:25)
went (73:23 - 73:27)
into the safari zone (73:25 - 73:30)
and i believe was heart gold soul silver (73:27 - 73:33)
and not too in a speci in the safaris (73:30 - 73:34)
again i'm going to get some of the (73:33 - 73:35)
numbers wrong (73:34 - 73:37)
you don't have to write in the youtube (73:35 - 73:38)
comments it just the the point of the (73:37 - 73:40)
story still stands oh now who's afraid (73:38 - 73:43)
of the youtube comments (73:40 - 73:45)
it was like a five percent chance for (73:43 - 73:48)
not to in this patch of grass (73:45 - 73:49)
and (73:48 - 73:51)
they ended up catching (73:49 - 73:54)
80 different shinies (73:51 - 73:57)
before they caught the shiny not too (73:54 - 74:00)
so they added all of those numbers up (73:57 - 74:01)
together (74:00 - 74:03)
like oh i went 8 000 and i got a (74:01 - 74:04)
parasect oh i went (74:03 - 74:07)
5 000 oh i got a nidoran oh i went (74:04 - 74:10)
10 000 i got another parasect (74:07 - 74:12)
so they added all of those together and (74:10 - 74:14)
they finally got the shiny not to (74:12 - 74:16)
so they're like i want a hundred (74:14 - 74:20)
thousand encounters for a shiny not too (74:16 - 74:21)
now (74:20 - 74:22)
there's so many there's so many issues (74:21 - 74:27)
with this one i mean technically (74:22 - 74:30)
yeah (74:27 - 74:33)
correct yes one i i i personally feel (74:30 - 74:35)
like phasing is a way (74:33 - 74:38)
to be like feel sorry for me i didn't (74:35 - 74:41)
get my target and my number is big i (74:38 - 74:43)
don't i mean it's a clickbait (74:41 - 74:44)
i don't i don't think (74:43 - 74:46)
i think if you are if you're if you're (74:44 - 74:48)
hunting for a specific pokemon and you (74:46 - 74:50)
get a different shiny i understand that (74:48 - 74:52)
there might be some frustration there (74:50 - 74:54)
right like i i probably wouldn't be (74:52 - 74:56)
frustrated be like whoa i got a i got a (74:54 - 74:57)
one eight thousand pokemon it wasn't the (74:56 - 74:59)
one i want but i got it what if it was a (74:57 - 75:01)
canto (74:59 - 75:01)
well you know it depends you know does (75:02 - 75:05)
it is it (75:03 - 75:06)
you know does it have a mark does it not (75:05 - 75:08)
have a marker no (75:06 - 75:11)
with a mark and a (75:08 - 75:11)
two (75:13 - 75:16)
you you could you you could have hunted (75:16 - 75:20)
that not to anywhere (75:18 - 75:22)
not to appears on other routes at a (75:20 - 75:24)
higher percentage right you could also (75:22 - 75:26)
have taken that not two to the day care (75:24 - 75:28)
and masseuded it (75:26 - 75:30)
there there's there's many ways to get (75:28 - 75:32)
that not too (75:30 - 75:32)
three is (75:34 - 75:38)
if you were to be like (75:36 - 75:39)
this is this is where the value thing (75:38 - 75:41)
comes in like (75:39 - 75:43)
if you were to say (75:41 - 75:46)
my not to is very valuable or more (75:43 - 75:49)
valuable than you're not to because i (75:46 - 75:51)
spent all this time and it took a (75:49 - 75:54)
hundred thousand encounters okay (75:51 - 75:55)
let's (75:54 - 75:58)
let's humor this for a second (75:55 - 76:00)
trade it (75:58 - 76:02)
trade it and tell the person you're (76:00 - 76:03)
trading it to you spent a hundred (76:02 - 76:05)
thousand hours on it or sorry a hundred (76:03 - 76:07)
000 encounters on it (76:05 - 76:08)
do you think the other person is going (76:07 - 76:10)
to be like hmm (76:08 - 76:13)
yeah well you see this shiny coughing i (76:10 - 76:15)
got i actually got it while i was in the (76:13 - 76:19)
cave and my leg was in my leg was under (76:15 - 76:22)
a rock and i survived off the cave (76:19 - 76:23)
drippings (76:22 - 76:27)
from the stalagtikes off of the ceiling (76:23 - 76:28)
and (76:27 - 76:30)
while i understand that it took your not (76:28 - 76:33)
to longer you can understand the (76:30 - 76:35)
emotional and physical pain i went (76:33 - 76:38)
through to get this coughing so i do (76:35 - 76:40)
think that your not too isn't worth as (76:38 - 76:42)
much as my like (76:40 - 76:45)
no one cares right one of my longest (76:42 - 76:47)
hunts (76:45 - 76:50)
ever was a shiny articuno and let's go (76:47 - 76:52)
pikachu let's go eevee some people might (76:50 - 76:53)
be like oh steve you went really long (76:52 - 76:55)
for the coughing no that coughing was a (76:53 - 76:57)
one in eight thousand chance and yes i (76:55 - 76:59)
did go two weeks on it i went a month (76:57 - 77:02)
with the shiny charm for a shiny (76:59 - 77:04)
articuno and let's go it was my longest (77:02 - 77:06)
hunt ever (77:04 - 77:07)
i caught that articuno i boxed it i (77:06 - 77:09)
never looked at it again was i excited (77:07 - 77:11)
when i got it no (77:09 - 77:13)
i was excited that it was i was excited (77:11 - 77:15)
that it was over (77:13 - 77:18)
but i there's i cannot go (77:15 - 77:21)
to a showroom i cannot go to (77:18 - 77:21)
uh (77:21 - 77:24)
antique roadshow i cannot go to another (77:21 - 77:26)
person and be like this articuno is very (77:24 - 77:29)
valuable (77:26 - 77:32)
i need something of value from you what (77:29 - 77:34)
pain did you go through to trade me (77:32 - 77:36)
right i understand that there's like an (77:34 - 77:38)
emotional value to that of like oh i (77:36 - 77:40)
went so long to get this (77:38 - 77:41)
great (77:40 - 77:43)
don't need to feel sorry for you i don't (77:41 - 77:46)
need you to play it up that you uh oh (77:43 - 77:49)
poor me i got 80 shinies before i got (77:46 - 77:51)
this one like no you're just you're (77:49 - 77:53)
fishing for something and i ain't giving (77:51 - 77:56)
it to you i'm not interested (77:53 - 78:00)
now if you were to say i got (77:56 - 78:02)
a shiny (78:00 - 78:04)
authentic synthy (78:02 - 78:06)
i would be like yeah you'd (78:04 - 78:08)
that that's very cool because there's (78:06 - 78:12)
only at this point in pokemon one way to (78:08 - 78:14)
get that you cannot muster that method (78:12 - 78:15)
for it (78:14 - 78:18)
you got you you it's a one percent (78:15 - 78:19)
chance (78:18 - 78:21)
in these fields and yes i know there's (78:19 - 78:23)
like kind of a ways to increase that but (78:21 - 78:24)
like (78:23 - 78:26)
a shiny (78:24 - 78:28)
authentic synthy is more rare because (78:26 - 78:32)
there's only one way to get it a shiny (78:28 - 78:35)
rubbish with the rare mark (78:32 - 78:39)
is significantly more rare a shiny alpha (78:35 - 78:42)
zeruah is more rare than in a chinese (78:39 - 78:44)
aurora like they they like again they (78:42 - 78:48)
did it they made a way to actually show (78:44 - 78:52)
that these shinies are more rare versus (78:48 - 78:55)
i caught a shiny fee bass and go (78:52 - 78:57)
versus i caught a shiny fee bass in x (78:55 - 78:59)
and y using chain method (78:57 - 79:02)
versus i caught a shiny fee bass in sun (78:59 - 79:04)
and moon using sos versus i caught a (79:02 - 79:06)
shiny fee bass and sword and shield (79:04 - 79:09)
using masuda method versus i caught a (79:06 - 79:10)
shiny fee bass (79:09 - 79:12)
fishing (79:10 - 79:14)
for the one percent and it was really (79:12 - 79:17)
hard and therefore my shiny feedback is (79:14 - 79:18)
worth more because the odds were one (79:17 - 79:21)
percent no because there's so many other (79:18 - 79:23)
ways for me to get shiny fee bass don't (79:21 - 79:25)
tell me your sob story to make your fee (79:23 - 79:29)
bass more rare you did that to yourself (79:25 - 79:29)
like it's just they're just it's just a (79:29 - 79:34)
weird gatekeeping thing of like (79:31 - 79:36)
like if i wanted my zubat to be more (79:34 - 79:38)
rare i will hang upside down as i hunt (79:36 - 79:40)
it and then when i get it i can be like (79:38 - 79:42)
well you know what i spent a hundred (79:40 - 79:44)
dollars i spent 100 hours hanging upside (79:42 - 79:47)
down as i hunted the zubat my zubat is (79:44 - 79:49)
significantly more rare than you (79:47 - 79:50)
checkmate (79:49 - 79:52)
that's how ridiculous people sound when (79:50 - 79:54)
they're like trying to justify their (79:52 - 79:58)
brightness here is my new gen 9 wish (79:54 - 80:01)
100 bp (79:58 - 80:01)
shiny paint (80:02 - 80:04)
you give it an item it switches it to (80:03 - 80:07)
the shiny (80:04 - 80:07)
like you can make any hunt specifically (80:10 - 80:15)
rare (80:13 - 80:17)
right (80:15 - 80:17)
yeah (80:17 - 80:24)
but also there are other ways to get it (80:20 - 80:24)
like yeah you could you could you could (80:24 - 80:29)
fish for a one percent fee bass on a (80:26 - 80:30)
route and then hope that you get the (80:29 - 80:33)
shiny one percent fee bass (80:30 - 80:35)
you can also refuse to get the shiny (80:33 - 80:37)
charm (80:35 - 80:38)
and do the same thing (80:37 - 80:40)
you can also refuse (80:38 - 80:43)
to not get the brilliance and make it (80:40 - 80:46)
more hard you can also (80:43 - 80:47)
take (80:46 - 80:50)
a (80:47 - 80:50)

thief broke into there before forcing (83:21 - 83:27)
their way through into oh i see not next (83:24 - 83:28)

myself (83:28 - 83:31)
is that a problem (83:29 - 83:32)
um (83:31 - 83:34)
they broke into the building next door (83:32 - 83:36)
to punch-out gaming and then got through (83:34 - 83:37)
got it (83:36 - 83:39)
uh the shop shared in further facebook (83:37 - 83:41)
posts that they will continue to operate (83:39 - 83:43)
as normal and has received a significant (83:41 - 83:44)
support from the community and other (83:43 - 83:47)
gaming stores who have helped resupply (83:44 - 83:49)
it with products (83:47 - 83:50)
it didn't look like the thief took any (83:49 - 83:52)
of these pokemon plushes poor charizard (83:50 - 83:54)
and dragon flushes are just scattered on (83:52 - 83:56)
the ground unloved (83:54 - 83:58)
feels very it's very hard to resell (83:56 - 84:00)
plushes (83:58 - 84:02)
but i mean if you're to steal it take (84:00 - 84:06)
the cute things too i mean (84:02 - 84:08)
take up a lot of space (84:06 - 84:11)
as as as will knows from moving me from (84:08 - 84:13)
one state to another (84:11 - 84:16)
plushies take up a lot of room (84:13 - 84:19)
this is very true or they take uh bins (84:16 - 84:21)
full bins (84:19 - 84:23)
but those bins are lighter than the (84:21 - 84:24)
other bins so (84:23 - 84:26)
they are lighter they just uh they just (84:24 - 84:28)
fill the space uh greg where is this (84:26 - 84:29)
place (84:28 - 84:32)
uh it's in forest lake okay so (84:29 - 84:36)
it is about half an hour north of saint (84:32 - 84:37)
paul (84:36 - 84:39)
have you been (84:37 - 84:42)
no why would i go to forest lake oh yeah (84:39 - 84:44)
that's like halfway to the list it's (84:42 - 84:48)
like there are 15 gaming stores between (84:44 - 84:51)
me and forest lake why would i drive (84:48 - 84:54)
half an hour out of my life to go to (84:51 - 84:56)
forest lake (84:54 - 84:58)
i i know because you will because you (84:56 - 85:00)
know punch out gaming i mean now that (84:58 - 85:02)
i'm aware of them and they need help (85:00 - 85:04)
maybe like we can go do a special spend (85:02 - 85:06)
some money yeah (85:04 - 85:08)
they got a chicken plush on the floor (85:06 - 85:10)
you could be like hey i saw your (85:08 - 85:12)
facebook post (85:10 - 85:14)

chickarito that the thief probably (85:14 - 85:18)
stepped on how about the one espn that (85:15 - 85:19)
looks like it's seen things sitting on (85:18 - 85:23)
the floor because i want that one (85:19 - 85:23)
i was trying to figure out why wouldn't (85:24 - 85:28)
you just not break into the store (85:26 - 85:30)
through the front door if you went to (85:28 - 85:31)
the next door one (85:30 - 85:34)
but they cut the hole in between the two (85:31 - 85:35)
shelves so it's like it's almost like (85:34 - 85:37)
they had like insider information of (85:35 - 85:40)
where to cut (85:37 - 85:40)
right (85:41 - 85:44)
i i think they did i mean i think they (85:43 - 85:47)
just got lucky (85:44 - 85:49)
like they're not showing if there's (85:47 - 85:50)
other areas where they tried to break (85:49 - 85:52)
through and ran into shelving (85:50 - 85:55)

julio's mexican restaurant okay a day (86:22 - 86:26)

the thief could have stole one booster (86:26 - 86:31)

spanish (89:34 - 89:37)
tinge to the program (89:35 - 89:39)

face and eyes hidden beneath a wide (89:42 - 89:46)
brimmed lotus sombrero (89:44 - 89:48)
uh and i said something about its (89:46 - 89:50)
predecessor can be found among the (89:48 - 89:52)
watery weeds (89:50 - 89:54)
but this week's pokemon must get stoned (89:52 - 89:56)
before it can become carefree indicating (89:54 - 89:58)
that you have to use a stone on it to (89:56 - 90:00)
evolve it so if you guess the final (89:58 - 90:02)
evolution well (90:00 - 90:06)
that's not how evolution works (90:02 - 90:09)
doesn't digimon it's (90:06 - 90:12)
frontier cramer amp (90:09 - 90:14)
nothing's frontier cramer it is not (90:12 - 90:16)
available (90:14 - 90:16)
he's water (90:17 - 90:21)
lombre (90:18 - 90:21)
see senor (90:22 - 90:26)
[Music] (90:23 - 90:26)
lombre i will say this lombre is one of (90:27 - 90:31)
the many (90:29 - 90:33)
battle evolutions that i like more than (90:31 - 90:35)
the final evolution what are you out of (90:33 - 90:38)
your mind i could see it i could see it (90:35 - 90:41)
ludacola was great could you see (90:38 - 90:45)
i'm not i am not commenting on how great (90:41 - 90:47)
or not great ludicolo is i am merely (90:45 - 90:48)
stating (90:47 - 90:52)
i like this middle evolution (90:48 - 90:54)
better (90:52 - 90:54)
low tad is is great can you see (90:54 - 90:58)
like (90:57 - 91:01)
lombre and nuzleaf just becoming a (90:58 - 91:03)
couple oh absolutely just like just the (91:01 - 91:05)
cutest couple ever we cannot get to the (91:03 - 91:07)
point of the show we are shipping (91:05 - 91:08)
pokemon together (91:07 - 91:09)
yeah (91:08 - 91:12)
yeah we can it's a new thing we've been (91:09 - 91:14)
through too much this episode (91:12 - 91:16)
pokemon shovel icon is very good shiny (91:14 - 91:18)
is (91:16 - 91:21)
very very good (91:18 - 91:22)
man (91:21 - 91:24)
so much (91:22 - 91:26)
uh (91:24 - 91:28)
lombard's evolutionary family has (91:26 - 91:30)
several unique attributes they have a (91:28 - 91:32)
unique type combination they're the only (91:30 - 91:34)
pokemon with the dual egg group of water (91:32 - 91:36)
one and grass they're the only pokemon (91:34 - 91:39)
that can have the ability uh rain dish (91:36 - 91:41)
without it being their hidden ability (91:39 - 91:42)
they're the only water type pokemon in (91:41 - 91:46)
the grass egg group (91:42 - 91:47)
we don't have any more grass water (91:46 - 91:50)
pokemon it's just this (91:47 - 91:53)
i believe you are correct (91:50 - 91:54)
there that's actually kind of crazy i (91:53 - 91:56)
love the fact that bulbapedia (91:54 - 91:58)
continually brings up egg groups like (91:56 - 91:59)
anybody (91:58 - 92:02)
in the past 15 years has cared about egg (91:59 - 92:05)
groups in any way shape or form but (92:02 - 92:07)
thank you bulbapedia i mean they have a (92:05 - 92:10)
thing and they're going to do it (92:07 - 92:12)
are you ready for this week's pokemon i (92:10 - 92:13)
am (92:12 - 92:17)
greg is not but i'm good go here we go (92:13 - 92:22)
many pokemon tcg players ask which card (92:17 - 92:25)
which features one of greg's favorite (92:22 - 92:28)
pokemon and was played by will (92:25 - 92:31)
and is one of the few pokemon stuffed (92:28 - 92:33)
toys owned by will (92:31 - 92:37)
has been banned from the pokemon tcg (92:33 - 92:39)
expanded format (92:37 - 92:42)
the expanded format allows for the play (92:39 - 92:45)
of all pokemon tcg cards dating back to (92:42 - 92:48)
the first pokemon black and white (92:45 - 92:49)
expansions (92:48 - 92:52)
this card was banned because its second (92:49 - 92:54)
attack allows for the creation of an (92:52 - 92:58)
infinite resource recursion strategy (92:54 - 93:01)
that is relatively simple to achieve (92:58 - 93:03)
basically allowing for infinite (93:01 - 93:05)
retrieval of darkness energy from the (93:03 - 93:07)
player's discard pile (93:05 - 93:09)
intriguingly (93:07 - 93:12)
both attacks on this pokemon's tcg card (93:09 - 93:15)
and those for auron guru which has also (93:12 - 93:17)
been banned in expanded format for the (93:15 - 93:23)
same reason are strikingly similar (93:17 - 93:23)
there you go (93:23 - 93:26)
i know it (93:24 - 93:28)
you pay attention to the expanded band (93:26 - 93:31)
and restricted list (93:28 - 93:32)
yeah (93:31 - 93:34)
i know exactly what card you're talking (93:32 - 93:37)
about too (93:34 - 93:39)
um (93:37 - 93:39)
oh boy oh you know we could have spent (93:39 - 93:44)
like 30 minutes about ptcg live because (93:41 - 93:46)
there was that canadian beta and uh it (93:44 - 93:47)
was uh (93:46 - 93:50)
from what i experienced real rough (93:47 - 93:52)
not good no because you're not canadian (93:50 - 93:54)
dude (93:52 - 93:56)
that's true it was very specifically (93:54 - 93:58)
