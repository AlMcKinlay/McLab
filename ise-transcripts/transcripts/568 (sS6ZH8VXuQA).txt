what's up everyone welcome to the (0:23 - 0:28)
568th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:26 - 0:31)
it's super effective I'm your host Steve (0:28 - 0:33)
with me is Hannah (0:31 - 0:36)
I haven't run into a gallerian bird in (0:33 - 0:38)
Pokemon go in this entire last week and (0:36 - 0:40)
I have done my adventure incense every (0:38 - 0:42)
day except maybe exactly one week ago (0:40 - 0:45)
okay good (0:42 - 0:45)
Greg also here I did I've only played (0:46 - 0:53)
the daily incense twice (0:50 - 0:57)
and uh glarion (0:53 - 0:59)
which one was it (0:57 - 1:03)
uh Zapdos maybe I don't remember it came (0:59 - 1:05)
I'm like oh oh golden Razz I'll throw a (1:03 - 1:09)
ball is like nope I went okay bye and (1:05 - 1:12)
then it's been so abysmally hot out and (1:09 - 1:14)
I was like what I don't (1:12 - 1:17)
why am I staring at my phone I just no (1:14 - 1:19)
I'm not doing this anymore so I probably (1:17 - 1:22)
played the daily incense twice because I (1:19 - 1:25)
find it exhausting it was very hot out (1:22 - 1:27)
yeah I mean it was (1:25 - 1:29)
on (1:27 - 1:32)
Thursday I went out and I'm like oh it's (1:29 - 1:34)
90. (1:32 - 1:36)
mm-hmm (1:34 - 1:39)
I'm going to melt out here (1:36 - 1:42)
I did not plan accordingly on this walk (1:39 - 1:44)
because I went to the sunny path instead (1:42 - 1:47)
of the Shady path and that was a bad (1:44 - 1:49)
idea (1:47 - 1:51)
uh well we do have Pokemon Go stuff to (1:49 - 1:52)
talk about since there's a new season (1:51 - 1:55)
but before we do that let's talk about (1:52 - 1:58)
all the scarlet and violet stuff (1:55 - 2:01)
um there's not a lot I think this raids (1:58 - 2:02)
ain't coming back yeah there's still (2:01 - 2:06)
been no news there's nothing no raids no (2:02 - 2:09)
how never again they realized it was a (2:06 - 2:10)
terrible mistake they've gone back on (2:09 - 2:12)
everything they've just pulled the plug (2:10 - 2:16)
call it it's over uh we we are recording (2:12 - 2:18)
this on Sunday morning uh normally new (2:16 - 2:20)
raids get announced on Sunday night so (2:18 - 2:23)
you know we'll we'll see we'll see (2:20 - 2:26)
zero (2:23 - 2:26)
it has been (2:28 - 2:32)
almost look I'm looking at my calendar (2:30 - 2:34)
got my RAID calendar up it has been (2:32 - 2:39)
almost a full month of no raids (2:34 - 2:42)
um well obviously like the five star and (2:39 - 2:44)
six star rates still alive but like (2:42 - 2:46)
promoted no promoted rates (2:44 - 2:49)
uh (2:46 - 2:52)
let's get into the first bit of news (2:49 - 2:55)
here which is uh Pokemon home it updated (2:52 - 2:59)
uh uh it updated actually uh on time (2:55 - 3:01)
they estimated that it would be down for (2:59 - 3:04)
six hours they said that the complete (3:01 - 3:06)
rollout would take about 24 hours after (3:04 - 3:07)
that so some people got in like right (3:06 - 3:10)
away some people got in you know 10 (3:07 - 3:12)
hours later just they had to like slowly (3:10 - 3:14)
roll it out to everyone (3:12 - 3:19)
um but it worked and it allowed some new (3:14 - 3:21)
Pokemon in those Pokemon have been in (3:19 - 3:23)
the game code since day one so very (3:21 - 3:26)
similar to sword and shield uh so I (3:23 - 3:27)
wanted to hear a lot of bunch of Pokemon (3:26 - 3:29)
that were (3:27 - 3:33)
hidden in the code and then the Mewtwo (3:29 - 3:36)
was hidden the entire time (3:33 - 3:39)
um so it updated from uh I think it was (3:36 - 3:40)
two point (3:39 - 3:45)
2.1 or something like that to 3.0 (3:40 - 3:45)
and it's not much different it's kind of (3:46 - 3:52)
the same (3:50 - 3:57)
15.99 a year app it always has been but (3:52 - 3:58)
um (3:57 - 4:01)
how has your both poke my Pokemon go (3:58 - 4:03)
experience or my Pokemon home experience (4:01 - 4:05)
was let me move all these Pokemon over (4:03 - 4:09)
and check if they're big or tiny uh (4:05 - 4:12)
I haven't moved anything I sort of sat (4:09 - 4:13)
down and realized like I haven't done (4:12 - 4:16)
like the postcard thing I haven't done (4:13 - 4:20)
the Gimme ghoul thing I haven't done (4:16 - 4:23)
home updates you know like I really (4:20 - 4:25)
literally when I it's Windows Community (4:23 - 4:27)
today I'm like oh I need to send 25 (4:25 - 4:28)
things to home so I have room for a (4:27 - 4:30)
community today and that has been my (4:28 - 4:33)
limit of doing things in home for about (4:30 - 4:36)
a year now so I I don't I don't know (4:33 - 4:38)
like I haven't even moved anything from (4:36 - 4:40)
Arceus (4:38 - 4:45)
in the home I've done nothing (4:40 - 4:45)
I'm in a similar boat I think the most (4:45 - 4:51)
interesting thing about this is Carbink (4:47 - 4:51)
and Diane say (4:53 - 5:00)
do you there's a question there (4:55 - 5:05)
I think I think lore wise yes (5:00 - 5:08)
yeah but none of this works Laura Wise (5:05 - 5:12)
no no they didn't they didn't introduce (5:08 - 5:14)
in the game in any way there was no sort (5:12 - 5:16)
of storyline there was just these (5:14 - 5:18)
Pokemon you can bring them in now (5:16 - 5:21)
and you can store your Pokemon from (5:18 - 5:22)
scarlet and violet in a place that if (5:21 - 5:24)
there's another game big breaking bug (5:22 - 5:26)
they'll be a little more safe probably (5:24 - 5:30)
but right now we're good on that I think (5:26 - 5:33)
yeah I mean like (5:30 - 5:37)
the legendary selection (5:33 - 5:37)
didn't really (5:38 - 5:44)
surprise me (5:41 - 5:44)
um (5:44 - 5:47)
mostly because like (5:45 - 5:50)
it's even all if you were a legendary in (5:47 - 5:52)
scarlet and violet sorry if you were a (5:50 - 5:54)
legendary in sword and shield you got (5:52 - 5:56)
moved over and then if you were from (5:54 - 5:59)
Legends Arceus you got moved over (5:56 - 6:03)
and then like ah me too and you are cool (5:59 - 6:06)
yeah they're always there wasn't there a (6:03 - 6:08)
weird issue where if you cut it and go (6:06 - 6:10)
you couldn't move it over immediately (6:08 - 6:13)
okay yeah sweet good call we we should (6:10 - 6:16)
talk about that this is not a it is a (6:13 - 6:19)
weird issue it is not a new issue it has (6:16 - 6:21)
been around since sword and shield so (6:19 - 6:24)
for whatever reason Pokemon go Pokemon (6:21 - 6:27)
Pokemon go Pokemon are treated as like (6:24 - 6:29)
second-class Pokemon (6:27 - 6:32)
you don't have like the rights that the (6:29 - 6:35)
main series Pokemon have so you need to (6:32 - 6:37)
like so if you had a Lugia wait Lugia (6:35 - 6:39)
doesn't work because he doesn't go to (6:37 - 6:43)
Scarlet Violet if you had a uh uh a (6:39 - 6:47)
Mesprit from or an azelf from Pokemon go (6:43 - 6:49)
you cannot move those into scarlet and (6:47 - 6:53)
violet without moving a mespret from (6:49 - 6:58)
either bdsp or sun and moon or Legends (6:53 - 6:59)
Arceus (6:58 - 7:02)
over into that game first there is a a (6:59 - 7:04)
workaround (7:02 - 7:07)
so if I traded my Mesprit my Pokemon go (7:04 - 7:09)
mespret to Hannah (7:07 - 7:12)
in Pokemon home and she traded me her (7:09 - 7:14)
Pokemon go Mesprit then we can move (7:12 - 7:17)
those mesprets into (7:14 - 7:20)
scarlet and violet that's wild that (7:17 - 7:22)
doesn't get rid of the go mark on them (7:20 - 7:25)
does it no it doesn't neither does (7:22 - 7:29)
moving a non-go mespret yeah the go Mark (7:25 - 7:32)
but it just it opens it up (7:29 - 7:34)
and this again this has been around it's (7:32 - 7:36)
not a bug this is the same thing that's (7:34 - 7:39)
been around since sword and shield (7:36 - 7:39)
feature what is the point like that is (7:43 - 7:48)
such a weird (7:47 - 7:51)
thing is like oh I caught them in here (7:48 - 7:53)
but if I didn't get them in some other (7:51 - 7:57)
way through some other game they're just (7:53 - 7:59)
trapped (7:57 - 8:00)
until (7:59 - 8:03)
yes (8:00 - 8:06)
that's so weird (8:03 - 8:06)
is oh ilka I don't know what the thought (8:07 - 8:13)
process is of like (8:10 - 8:13)
so you can just end it there I don't (8:14 - 8:18)
know what the thought process is like (8:16 - 8:21)
this is a thing for all of us (8:18 - 8:24)
if it's like um well we don't want (8:21 - 8:25)
people (8:24 - 8:30)
moving over their Mew from Pokemon go so (8:25 - 8:33)
okay we use a really good example I (8:30 - 8:35)
actually think so what was the example I (8:33 - 8:37)
used before Mesprit mu is a better (8:35 - 8:39)
example because like (8:37 - 8:41)
in the past the old ways to get Mew were (8:39 - 8:44)
to like walk into Toys R Us (8:41 - 8:47)
uh like harass the 16 year old employee (8:44 - 8:49)
working there to like link trade you the (8:47 - 8:51)
Mew and then you would do that and then (8:49 - 8:52)
they they still hate their job and their (8:51 - 8:54)
life and then you walk out with a Mew (8:52 - 8:56)
right same thing for GameStop right no (8:54 - 8:57)
and that Game Stops happy when you're (8:56 - 8:59)
walking in and getting a code card uh (8:57 - 9:02)
but it's like very easy by assuming that (8:59 - 9:04)
you live close enough to GameStop (9:02 - 9:07)
uh or Toys R Us (9:04 - 9:09)
and then you have it at least with like (9:07 - 9:13)
the Mew in Pokemon go you have to get to (9:09 - 9:16)
level 40. you have to do like a hundred (9:13 - 9:18)
excellent throws or like 40 I don't even (9:16 - 9:19)
remember what the quest line it is it (9:18 - 9:23)
was too long it was long and tiring (9:19 - 9:26)
so it's not even like well we don't want (9:23 - 9:29)
Pokemon go players to send like easy (9:26 - 9:32)
mythicals over because all the mythicals (9:29 - 9:34)
in Pokemon go (9:32 - 9:39)
you gotta work really hard for them (9:34 - 9:39)
that's true yeah the access and Darkrai (9:39 - 9:45)
but at least in that like you have to (9:42 - 9:46)
pay a dollar (9:45 - 9:50)
at least I mean I paid a lot more (9:46 - 9:54)
walking into that game stop I think (9:50 - 9:54)
the only thing I (9:56 - 10:01)
think our capitalistic thing of like (9:57 - 10:01)
hey go buy a main Series game (10:01 - 10:05)
weird but or some sort of arbitrary (10:06 - 10:11)
Pokemon are worth less and don't matter (10:08 - 10:13)
as much and don't mean as much some sort (10:11 - 10:16)
of some sort of thing related to that (10:13 - 10:19)
that is probably being rebalanced as the (10:16 - 10:22)
games get older and as things (10:19 - 10:24)
move along but if this has been a thing (10:22 - 10:25)
for a long time I wouldn't be surprised (10:24 - 10:29)
if one go was first linked to home (10:25 - 10:30)
there was some sort of weird value (10:29 - 10:32)
judgment there (10:30 - 10:34)
well when go was first linked to home it (10:32 - 10:36)
was only let's go Peach let's give you (10:34 - 10:38)
so there's only one way and then when (10:36 - 10:41)
the big like Pokemon sword and shield (10:38 - 10:44)
home thing happened that's when this (10:41 - 10:47)
transfer thing started (10:44 - 10:48)
um (10:47 - 10:50)
yeah I (10:48 - 10:50)
there's there's no there's no secret (10:51 - 10:55)
that there's there is value to Pokemon (10:53 - 10:57)
from at least game freak's perspective (10:55 - 11:00)
that's why we still don't have that's (10:57 - 11:01)
why they still shiny like Pokemon that's (11:00 - 11:04)
why I we still don't have shiny Victini (11:01 - 11:07)
or shiny Keldeo (11:04 - 11:09)
um so there are some weird value thing (11:07 - 11:13)
internally that they they do but like (11:09 - 11:17)
even even non (11:13 - 11:17)
like you could even argue with like sun (11:17 - 11:22)
and moon to ultra sun and moon like (11:19 - 11:23)
they're they're pretty much the same (11:22 - 11:26)
game but hey pay us 40 more dollars and (11:23 - 11:29)
we'll give you five new Pokemon we'll (11:26 - 11:31)
give you well technically like four (11:29 - 11:33)
because you'd have to buy both versions (11:31 - 11:36)
to get the other one because it was like (11:33 - 11:39)
well plus people (11:36 - 11:39)
like those were the only five new (11:41 - 11:45)
Pokemon (11:43 - 11:49)
for a forty dollar experience (11:45 - 11:49)
heck yeah (11:49 - 11:52)
somebody (11:52 - 11:54)
she mentioned this is my twitch stream (11:53 - 11:55)
they were like Steve you said a couple (11:54 - 11:58)
years ago that this was I think it was (11:55 - 12:00)
around when they announced the National (11:58 - 12:01)
dex cut (12:00 - 12:03)
and they said the thing you the thing (12:01 - 12:07)
you said ultimately came true which was (12:03 - 12:10)
as we keep going deeper and deeper (12:07 - 12:14)
because there are Cuts in the Pokedex (12:10 - 12:17)
they are now making you (12:14 - 12:19)
realize that you are missing games that (12:17 - 12:22)
have those Pokemon like right now as of (12:19 - 12:24)
this recording one of the rarest Pokemon (12:22 - 12:27)
is just enamorous (12:24 - 12:30)
she is just incredibly rare because (12:27 - 12:33)
she's in one game and (12:30 - 12:36)
like Cub Food or Shifu like you could (12:33 - 12:38)
start a fresh game of sword and shield (12:36 - 12:41)
get to this train station go over to the (12:38 - 12:42)
Isle of armor and get Cub Food pretty (12:41 - 12:44)
quickly you could probably get Cub Food (12:42 - 12:47)
in like maybe 45 minutes of playing (12:44 - 12:49)
sword and shield yeah like anamorous you (12:47 - 12:52)
have to pretty much go through all of (12:49 - 12:55)
Legends Arceus to get her uh there's a (12:52 - 12:56)
lot of work that has to be put in for (12:55 - 12:57)
that Pokemon (12:56 - 12:59)
and (12:57 - 13:03)
like if they keep cutting poke well they (12:59 - 13:06)
will right yeah five main Series games (13:03 - 13:08)
they're not doing a game with all of (13:06 - 13:09)
them anymore (13:08 - 13:12)
like if they keep cutting that kind of (13:09 - 13:14)
stuff they will artificially increase (13:12 - 13:16)
the difficulty of getting Pokemon (13:14 - 13:18)
because (13:16 - 13:20)
systems will change or people will lose (13:18 - 13:22)
their games or like did they didn't (13:20 - 13:25)
finish those games or (13:22 - 13:27)
you know a game that was really easy to (13:25 - 13:28)
get (13:27 - 13:29)
you know it was really easy to get (13:28 - 13:32)
Vivion and x and y and then all of a (13:29 - 13:34)
sudden right before scarlet and violet (13:32 - 13:35)
people were like I'm missing video in (13:34 - 13:37)
our video it's really hard to get or (13:35 - 13:38)
like deerling was a big problem for a (13:37 - 13:40)
long time for people (13:38 - 13:42)
um so it's like they cycle this over and (13:40 - 13:44)
over (13:42 - 13:45)
which uh (13:44 - 13:49)
yeah they didn't add any like new (13:45 - 13:53)
just the joy of false scarcity (13:49 - 13:53)
uh they didn't add any like new features (13:53 - 13:57)
like you still can't cut you still can't (13:55 - 14:00)
check marks in the switch version (13:57 - 14:03)
um ultimately like the apps seem exactly (14:00 - 14:04)
the same they seem very sluggish right (14:03 - 14:06)
now because (14:04 - 14:09)
so many people are trying to connect (14:06 - 14:11)
um they added new stickers (14:09 - 14:16)
hey come to my room (14:11 - 14:16)
uh that they added the changing of the (14:17 - 14:22)
moves which is like okay I guess you can (14:20 - 14:23)
convert (14:22 - 14:26)
your your what are they called your (14:23 - 14:30)
Pokemon home points to LP points so one (14:26 - 14:34)
Pokemon point and you can only hold (14:30 - 14:39)
I think 99 999. (14:34 - 14:39)
um so one Pokemon home Point converts to (14:39 - 14:47)
10 LP so ultimately if you had Max home (14:43 - 14:48)
points it would convert to like one (14:47 - 14:50)
point (14:48 - 14:52)
two 1.6 million something like 1.4 (14:50 - 14:55)
million Maybe (14:52 - 14:55)
it's not a good TR it's it's not great (14:55 - 15:00)
at all (14:58 - 15:00)
like you you can you can spend a million (15:01 - 15:08)
League points on like what like a (15:04 - 15:10)
hundred vitamins or something like you (15:08 - 15:12)
can burn through it instantly I've spent (15:10 - 15:14)
no League points (15:12 - 15:16)
I haven't in a very long time (15:14 - 15:19)
I have not spent I have not I keep like (15:16 - 15:21)
when it was bank I held on to my BP (15:19 - 15:23)
points thinking I there's gonna be (15:21 - 15:25)
something something I need right and (15:23 - 15:27)
there never was and now I'm holding on (15:25 - 15:30)
to LPS like there's gonna be something I (15:27 - 15:32)
need if raids start back up maybe (15:30 - 15:34)
eventually Maybe (15:32 - 15:37)
maybe like (15:34 - 15:40)
you need like 3 000 League points Four (15:37 - 15:43)
lechonk Tails and like two something to (15:40 - 15:46)
make like protect (15:43 - 15:47)
[Music] (15:46 - 15:52)
okay speaking of Game Freak regulation D (15:47 - 15:55)
is going to start yeah (15:52 - 15:59)
D is here fine we've all been waiting (15:55 - 16:03)
for it regulation D starts on July 1st (15:59 - 16:08)
this will be the world's format uh funny (16:03 - 16:11)
enough there will be no scheduled (16:08 - 16:14)
tournaments from this time Two Worlds so (16:11 - 16:15)
um (16:14 - 16:17)
maybe game freak does hate us maybe (16:15 - 16:19)
we'll take it back (16:17 - 16:21)
we thought we had a thing and they (16:19 - 16:24)
ripped it away with regulation D I mean (16:21 - 16:25)
it's (16:24 - 16:27)
I'm finding this super interesting (16:25 - 16:29)
because uh (16:27 - 16:30)
the (16:29 - 16:33)
VGC Community really is not liking this (16:30 - 16:35)
but something really similar is (16:33 - 16:38)
happening in GBL they're changing up the (16:35 - 16:40)
moves changing up the meta there right (16:38 - 16:41)
before the big tournament that's (16:40 - 16:43)
happening this weekend and that was (16:41 - 16:45)
received really well people were very (16:43 - 16:48)
excited about the flexibility and the (16:45 - 16:49)
adaptability that you're going to need (16:48 - 16:52)
to be able to change up your teams last (16:49 - 16:54)
minute for this competition (16:52 - 16:56)
but that's not being taken the same way (16:54 - 16:59)
for this VGC (16:56 - 17:02)
yeah I think um Michael what's his name (16:59 - 17:05)
Michael sterenka sterenka I think he (17:02 - 17:06)
said during his interview which we'll (17:05 - 17:07)
talk about in the later half of the show (17:06 - 17:10)
that Niantic wanted to wait till seasons (17:07 - 17:12)
were over to change moves so people (17:10 - 17:14)
wouldn't be upset but they got feedback (17:12 - 17:16)
that trainers were like no change them (17:14 - 17:18)
sooner we don't want to wait till the (17:16 - 17:20)
end of a season yeah um so I think he (17:18 - 17:23)
actually said that like oh well we're (17:20 - 17:24)
gonna probably change him a little more (17:23 - 17:25)
often just so (17:24 - 17:28)
like people don't feel discouraged and (17:25 - 17:31)
then have to wait till the end of (17:28 - 17:33)
the time I think it might still be (17:31 - 17:35)
seasonal it was it was the last season (17:33 - 17:36)
so (17:35 - 17:39)
since awful oh okay okay yeah the (17:36 - 17:41)
feedback (17:39 - 17:41)
Rising heroes or whatever it was called (17:42 - 17:45)
yep (17:44 - 17:49)
but yeah the VGC and GBL (17:45 - 17:51)
reacting completely differently to this (17:49 - 17:54)
pretty similar kind of news (17:51 - 17:54)
um so the regulation D allows for (17:55 - 18:04)
some legendary Pokemon this is very (18:01 - 18:06)
confusing if you don't follow because (18:04 - 18:07)
there are (18:06 - 18:09)
because okay number one just because of (18:07 - 18:11)
Pokemon it's legendary doesn't mean it's (18:09 - 18:14)
good we want to get that that's like the (18:11 - 18:16)
Hello type now hello both are very (18:14 - 18:18)
terrible technically you know it'd be (18:16 - 18:21)
nice to them they have one gimmick and (18:18 - 18:25)
it's like explosion (18:21 - 18:25)
um but okay so here are the new Pokemon (18:25 - 18:29)
that you can use I'm not gonna read the (18:27 - 18:30)
whole I'm not gonna say Charmander (18:29 - 18:31)
Charmeleon Charizard I'm just gonna say (18:30 - 18:33)
Charizard (18:31 - 18:36)
so you can use Charizard now alolan (18:33 - 18:40)
Raichu a lowland dog Trio uh Berserker (18:36 - 18:42)
technically Berserker Berserker has been (18:40 - 18:44)
in the game since day one you could go (18:42 - 18:47)
to the language Professor I think and (18:44 - 18:49)
get a Berserker from the school but (18:47 - 18:52)
since Berserker is not allowed in the (18:49 - 18:55)
berserker's not native to the pal day (18:52 - 18:57)
index it wasn't allowed in competition (18:55 - 18:59)
so now it is (18:57 - 19:05)
alolan Meowth uh uh his suian Arcanine (18:59 - 19:08)
[Music] (19:05 - 19:08)
regular Tauros (19:16 - 19:22)
Articuno Zapdos and Moltres and their (19:19 - 19:24)
galerian forms are all now allowed now (19:22 - 19:27)
those are not considered box legendaries (19:24 - 19:30)
so like Kyogre Groudon they're banned (19:27 - 19:31)
because they're very they're more (19:30 - 19:34)
powerful because they're box legendaries (19:31 - 19:37)
um Typhlosion and history and Typhlosion (19:34 - 19:39)
regular Quagsire (19:37 - 19:40)
I think that was another thing where (19:39 - 19:44)
like you could trade for a whooper yeah (19:40 - 19:49)
um history and coefficient over quill (19:44 - 19:51)
speaking of bad legendaries mespret (19:49 - 19:54)
uxian azov I think the only one that's (19:51 - 19:57)
like kind of okay is passive but they're (19:54 - 20:01)
pretty bad uh hisuin Sneasel and then (19:57 - 20:04)
sneezler he Tran and Cresselia (20:01 - 20:05)
um (20:04 - 20:07)
Samurai and hisuin Samurai his sui and (20:05 - 20:10)
lilliganth white striped basculine and (20:07 - 20:12)
then bask a legion (20:10 - 20:16)
suing zorark suian bravery (20:12 - 20:18)
let's talk about really good legendaries (20:16 - 20:22)
Tornadus thunderous Landorus and their (20:18 - 20:26)
uh the Therian forms (20:22 - 20:26)
uh Chestnut hey the chestnut's bad don't (20:27 - 20:31)
worry he's still bad (20:30 - 20:33)
um Delphox (20:31 - 20:38)
Greninja car bank is finally legal bring (20:33 - 20:42)
all the carvings you want yeah (20:38 - 20:42)
although I don't think might maybe good (20:43 - 20:48)
for competitive I actually I haven't (20:46 - 20:50)
seen any I I've watched some trainers (20:48 - 20:51)
play (20:50 - 20:53)
the new format I haven't seen any (20:51 - 20:55)
goodras (20:53 - 21:00)
butra very good for raid battles uh and (20:55 - 21:02)
I made a history and Goodra build on (21:00 - 21:03)
YouTube (21:02 - 21:04)
um but very very good for five and six (21:03 - 21:06)
star raids (21:04 - 21:08)
um he's doing avalog decidueye is now (21:06 - 21:12)
legal uh rila boom legal score bunny (21:08 - 21:14)
score bunny (21:12 - 21:17)
Cinder Ace is legal Cinder eisenrilla (21:14 - 21:21)
boom very good in gen 8 competitive (21:17 - 21:22)
um we'll see if they end up being good (21:21 - 21:25)
here intelian was never really that good (21:22 - 21:28)
but you can use them uh Cub Food or (21:25 - 21:32)
Shifu both urshifu very good (21:28 - 21:34)
Reggie elekin Reggie Drago are back (21:32 - 21:37)
Drago has always been bad (21:34 - 21:39)
um aliki has always been good and this (21:37 - 21:42)
time it has Terra Blast (21:39 - 21:44)
it's even better it's even better the (21:42 - 21:46)
horses are back so glass rear and (21:44 - 21:48)
Specter they're both very good (21:46 - 21:50)
um they're even better when you put a (21:48 - 21:52)
rabbit on top of it but uh the Shadow (21:50 - 21:54)
Rider form or the Shadow Rider and ice (21:52 - 21:56)
rider are not allowed currently because (21:54 - 22:00)
calorex is they're technically calorics (21:56 - 22:03)
um when they're the the rabbit is on it (22:00 - 22:04)
but (22:03 - 22:05)
um there's they're still good separately (22:04 - 22:07)
I'm not sure if they're good in this (22:05 - 22:10)
format but I would assume yes uh weird (22:07 - 22:13)
ear Cleaver ursuluna Basque Legion (22:10 - 22:15)
sneezler over oh okay we already got all (22:13 - 22:18)
those are illegal (22:15 - 22:18)
there's gonna be an EVO light Romy give (22:20 - 22:25)
Eagle Strat that just surprises (22:23 - 22:28)
everybody this time they're coming no (22:25 - 22:30)
one will see it and then finally (22:28 - 22:33)
anamorous is legal (22:30 - 22:36)
um and only the turtle one is kind of (22:33 - 22:38)
the turtle one is the turtle one is what (22:36 - 22:39)
you want (22:38 - 22:40)
um (22:39 - 22:43)
so that's a lot of new Pokemon that's a (22:40 - 22:47)
lot of powerful Pokemon I almost I think (22:43 - 22:48)
I said on the show I thought regulation (22:47 - 22:51)
D was just going to be like his suian (22:48 - 22:54)
which is would Shake Up The Meta I mean (22:51 - 22:59)
like Arcanine uh sneezler uh ursuluna (22:54 - 23:02)
probably particularly like that's what (22:59 - 23:05)
at least like 15 Pokemon that would (23:02 - 23:07)
probably Shake Up The Meta a little bit (23:05 - 23:09)
this is just like (23:07 - 23:13)
40 Pokemon and like some of the most (23:09 - 23:15)
powerful Pokemon we've seen this is a (23:13 - 23:17)
lot yeah (23:15 - 23:19)
yeah and bringing back in some of the (23:17 - 23:22)
Pokemon that have dominated The Meta (23:19 - 23:24)
before is maybe what's getting people (23:22 - 23:27)
the most frustrated and dust separated (23:24 - 23:28)
out from what's happening in go right (23:27 - 23:30)
now (23:28 - 23:32)
to be fair there are some players that (23:30 - 23:33)
absolutely love this kind of meta (23:32 - 23:35)
because it's it's a little bit faster (23:33 - 23:38)
and you have a lot more options like (23:35 - 23:40)
prior like even even the move Tailwind (23:38 - 23:44)
like your best Tailwind before this was (23:40 - 23:48)
murkrow and talent (23:44 - 23:48)
and now you have now you have a bunch of (23:49 - 23:54)
legendaries that can hit that Tailwind (23:52 - 23:57)
button what's really interesting is they (23:54 - 24:01)
nerfed Reggie elakey going into this (23:57 - 24:03)
um so transistor would give you a 1.5 (24:01 - 24:05)
boost (24:03 - 24:08)
um and then I think it's dragon's maw (24:05 - 24:12)
which is the same as Drago's Drago's (24:08 - 24:14)
ability which is also 1.5 for Dragon (24:12 - 24:17)
moves transistors electric moves uh (24:14 - 24:20)
transistor got nerfed to 1.3 and then (24:17 - 24:23)
but they left Dragon Ball the same (24:20 - 24:26)
because no one used Dragon I don't think (24:23 - 24:27)
it's going to change anything (24:26 - 24:30)
also spoiler Reggie Loki is still (24:27 - 24:33)
incredible uh you could argue maybe even (24:30 - 24:35)
more incredible with the access to drag (24:33 - 24:38)
with Terra Blast (24:35 - 24:38)
um (24:39 - 24:43)
they nerfed urshifu uh Wicked Blow (24:40 - 24:46)
instead of doing uh uh 80 base damage (24:43 - 24:48)
and always creating it does 75 base (24:46 - 24:51)
damage and always critting so uh (24:48 - 24:54)
they're trying with a question mark at (24:51 - 24:57)
the end there they're maybe trying yeah (24:54 - 24:59)
I mean there's battle there's balance (24:57 - 25:01)
there yeah I mean that's that's not (24:59 - 25:04)
surprising like uh in Gen 6 Talonflame (25:01 - 25:07)
was busted because of Gale wings and (25:04 - 25:08)
then they changed an Omega Ruby Alpha (25:07 - 25:10)
Sapphire (25:08 - 25:12)
um yeah it made it worse (25:10 - 25:14)
it's still good though still good but (25:12 - 25:18)
more fair I guess yeah I mean I suppose (25:14 - 25:20)
like dropping it by five when you're (25:18 - 25:25)
looking at crits it's a bigger drop than (25:20 - 25:25)
probably yes initially I can I can I can (25:26 - 25:34)
say I I watched a dark urshifu Wicked (25:30 - 25:38)
blow a Cresselia and uh and the the the (25:34 - 25:41)
per the streamer was like this should (25:38 - 25:43)
knock out and then the Cresselia lived (25:41 - 25:46)
with like 10 HP and then all of chat was (25:43 - 25:49)
like well they did nurse (25:46 - 25:49)
I mean they know what they know what (26:00 - 26:04)
they're doing they give us and they take (26:03 - 26:07)
it away (26:04 - 26:07)
um (26:07 - 26:11)
yeah I I think (26:09 - 26:14)
I think (26:11 - 26:18)
the competitive scene might not be as (26:14 - 26:21)
upset if they moved this like one month (26:18 - 26:24)
earlier because then Hartford Milwaukee (26:21 - 26:27)
and Portland I think would have all been (26:24 - 26:29)
in this format and that would be like oh (26:27 - 26:31)
at least three tournaments we could (26:29 - 26:32)
watch (26:31 - 26:34)
for this format now we have you know (26:32 - 26:36)
Joel you pretty they pretty much have 45 (26:34 - 26:38)
days (26:36 - 26:41)
to figure out what's going into Worlds (26:38 - 26:46)
and I I I don't know (26:41 - 26:46)
you made it to Worlds you probably know (26:47 - 26:51)
what you're doing you're probably very (26:49 - 26:53)
familiar with competitive Pokemon so (26:51 - 26:56)
it's in the grand scheme of things it's (26:53 - 26:58)
a smaller set of players that really (26:56 - 27:01)
have to figure this out (26:58 - 27:03)
um (27:01 - 27:03)
different skill set is what I've been (27:03 - 27:08)
hearing kind of just that early format (27:06 - 27:11)
and adapting to trying to create your (27:08 - 27:14)
own team and be good at it before (27:11 - 27:16)
anybody really knows what's going on (27:14 - 27:18)
before it's more set in stone is a (27:16 - 27:20)
different skill set yeah than a more (27:18 - 27:23)
Sandstone format it feels like they're (27:20 - 27:26)
going into Worlds (27:23 - 27:29)
with things being more volatile which (27:26 - 27:32)
feels like it will make a more exciting (27:29 - 27:35)
worlds but not necessarily A great (27:32 - 27:36)
experience for the people that I have to (27:35 - 27:38)
play in it right like (27:36 - 27:42)
45 days feels like a lot but there's a (27:38 - 27:45)
lot to cycle through there's a lot of (27:42 - 27:47)
different battles that you have to do (27:45 - 27:49)
there's a lot of variables that won't (27:47 - 27:52)
necessarily like it takes time for that (27:49 - 27:54)
stuff to Bubble Up (27:52 - 27:57)
um and so I mean I sort of understand (27:54 - 27:59)
the hesitancy of being frustrated like (27:57 - 28:02)
this is so quick to the big deal but I (27:59 - 28:05)
mean it will make Spectators be like we (28:02 - 28:07)
don't have any idea what to expect (28:05 - 28:09)
because the competitors probably don't (28:07 - 28:10)
have anything I really what to expect (28:09 - 28:13)
and that's exciting uh also it's (28:10 - 28:15)
frustrating because I would not want to (28:13 - 28:18)
be in that situation (28:15 - 28:21)
yeah I I mean I took this is this is why (28:18 - 28:23)
I I always like roll my eyes at the (28:21 - 28:26)
Smogon format because like Smogon band (28:23 - 28:30)
they they straight up banned Hound Stone (28:26 - 28:33)
pretty shortly after scarlet and violet (28:30 - 28:37)
launched Smogon being a single 1v1 (28:33 - 28:39)
um they banned houndstone because of the (28:37 - 28:42)
move last respects there's only two (28:39 - 28:44)
Pokemon that get the move last respects (28:42 - 28:46)
it's houndstone and it's Basco Legion (28:44 - 28:48)
and basket Legion wasn't even legal so (28:46 - 28:50)
they they banned all of houndstone and (28:48 - 28:52)
within the like a week of the game (28:50 - 28:54)
coming out (28:52 - 28:56)
and my thought process is why don't you (28:54 - 28:58)
just ban the move like why'd you have to (28:56 - 29:01)
ban the whole Pokemon and then (28:58 - 29:03)
um you know now that reggiela key is (29:01 - 29:06)
legal Reggie elliki got banned in Smogon (29:03 - 29:08)
within like two hours they banned (29:06 - 29:09)
regular key (29:08 - 29:13)
and it's frustrating because they're (29:09 - 29:16)
like Smogon is looking for like this (29:13 - 29:18)
perfect balance meta (29:16 - 29:21)
and if you if we just take the the main (29:18 - 29:24)
series VGC and we look at uh regulation (29:21 - 29:28)
C the start of Regulation C was all of (29:24 - 29:31)
balance and Palance was a core which (29:28 - 29:35)
consisted of palafin amungus Arcanine (29:31 - 29:37)
and fluttermane so it was those four (29:35 - 29:39)
Pokemon if you had those four Pokemon (29:37 - 29:41)
you were running a core called Palance (29:39 - 29:43)
and it was very dominant (29:41 - 29:45)
um and now if you looked at the last (29:43 - 29:47)
like two or three tournaments you'd (29:45 - 29:50)
rarely see talents and the reason you (29:47 - 29:52)
don't see it is because it took two (29:50 - 29:54)
months to figure out how to beat it and (29:52 - 29:55)
people have figured out how to beat it (29:54 - 29:57)
and they figured out better teams or (29:55 - 29:58)
better counters right balance is still (29:57 - 30:01)
really good (29:58 - 30:03)
um but people have figured out how to (30:01 - 30:04)
beat it this was the same thing that (30:03 - 30:05)
happened in scarlet and violet with a (30:04 - 30:08)
team called renia uh there was a (30:05 - 30:10)
Japanese player named virinia and they (30:08 - 30:12)
made a team that consisted of uh it was (30:10 - 30:15)
Charizard and gosh I can't remember what (30:12 - 30:17)
was on the team it was it was Charizard (30:15 - 30:20)
and a couple other Pokemon (30:17 - 30:23)
um and it took about a month and a half (30:20 - 30:25)
and people figured out how to beat renia (30:23 - 30:27)
and (30:25 - 30:30)
we moved on right like we built on pot (30:27 - 30:32)
upon we built on top of that and so (30:30 - 30:34)
that's kind of like the nice thing about (30:32 - 30:37)
like a three-month format is you see the (30:34 - 30:40)
evolution of teams and where they go (30:37 - 30:41)
um and that's why I get frustrated when (30:40 - 30:43)
I look at Smogon because they're like ah (30:41 - 30:44)
it's been two hours no one can figure (30:43 - 30:47)
out elegy just banned them (30:44 - 30:47)
trainers are smart enough to figure it (30:49 - 30:53)
out right like (30:51 - 30:59)
not every not every uh team has like (30:53 - 31:01)
every team can be beatable (30:59 - 31:03)
we just have to like figure out which (31:01 - 31:08)
Pokemon move around to make that happen (31:03 - 31:08)
what do I know same thing happened in (31:10 - 31:15)
TCG though (31:12 - 31:15)
okay let's uh (31:17 - 31:23)
speaking of issues and speaking of uh (31:20 - 31:24)
competitive stuff this will be our last (31:23 - 31:27)
article before break uh we talked on the (31:24 - 31:30)
show what was that like two two weeks (31:27 - 31:33)
ago two podcasts ago about how uh a (31:30 - 31:35)
bunch of Korean and Japanese players (31:33 - 31:37)
qualified for an event and then (31:35 - 31:39)
something went wrong and then they (31:37 - 31:43)
pulled the qualification and then I was (31:39 - 31:45)
like no one reported on this why (31:43 - 31:47)
comicbook.com I know you listen to this (31:45 - 31:48)
podcast (31:47 - 31:51)
maybe you did I didn't see the Tweet but (31:48 - 31:53)
like (31:51 - 31:53)
um (31:53 - 31:56)
it was weird that no one reported on it (31:54 - 31:59)
because like Esports and Pokemon to me (31:56 - 32:02)
are like two very clickable things (31:59 - 32:07)
and especially when two people who have (32:02 - 32:10)
won World tournaments one being sejen (32:07 - 32:13)
Park of Korea that was the Pachirisu guy (32:10 - 32:16)
and everyone instantly knows who that is (32:13 - 32:18)
now that I said it was the Patrice and (32:16 - 32:20)
then the other one being Ray Rizzo (32:18 - 32:23)
they both qualified and then they both (32:20 - 32:25)
got their they both qualified to go to (32:23 - 32:27)
Worlds and then they both got those (32:25 - 32:29)
ripped away from them because of issues (32:27 - 32:30)
yep (32:29 - 32:33)
um one of the issues being you would (32:30 - 32:35)
play the same person you're right over (32:33 - 32:38)
and over and over and over again (32:35 - 32:38)
um (32:39 - 32:44)
so (32:41 - 32:44)
we got news that four Korean players (32:44 - 32:53)
who were guaranteed to go to Worlds (32:49 - 32:56)
still had to play each other (32:53 - 32:59)
and so in order to (32:56 - 33:02)
point out to the Pokemon company (32:59 - 33:06)
that this whole scarlet and violet (33:02 - 33:09)
format has been terrible to Korean (33:06 - 33:11)
Japanese players since they were all (33:09 - 33:14)
guaranteed to go to Worlds anyways they (33:11 - 33:18)
all agreed to bring six Pokemon with the (33:14 - 33:21)
move metronome to finish their (33:18 - 33:22)
tournament that was like their way to (33:21 - 33:26)
protest is like we all qualified anyways (33:22 - 33:28)
you have done nothing to support us you (33:26 - 33:31)
have taken away our our qualifications (33:28 - 33:33)
we have re-qualified you've taken them (33:31 - 33:35)
away we've re-qualified (33:33 - 33:37)
um and then all four of those trainers (33:35 - 33:40)
got banned and they are no longer going (33:37 - 33:42)
to Worlds because (33:40 - 33:45)
Pokemon said we didn't like that you (33:42 - 33:47)
brought six Pokemon with metronome (33:45 - 33:50)
so I have it here (33:47 - 33:51)
um (33:50 - 33:54)
uh hello this is uh we'll we'll read (33:51 - 33:56)
through it it's pretty short but it (33:54 - 33:57)
pretty much explains everything better (33:56 - 33:59)
than I can explain it (33:57 - 34:00)
hello this is Nash I've been asked a lot (33:59 - 34:02)
what's happening in Korea and how we (34:00 - 34:04)
ended up locking in metronome for the (34:02 - 34:06)
national finals only to be disqualified (34:04 - 34:08)
for this so I'm writing down to those (34:06 - 34:11)
I'm writing this down to explain so if (34:08 - 34:12)
you've been catching up with all the (34:11 - 34:13)
issues around the Asian circuit like (34:12 - 34:15)
other Asian regions Korea has been (34:13 - 34:18)
suffering this year here are some of the (34:15 - 34:20)
major events that have happened in order (34:18 - 34:23)
uh number one before we go oh technology (34:20 - 34:26)
before we go in a little background of (34:23 - 34:29)
the Korean VGC format before covid we (34:26 - 34:31)
used to have three different IRL events (34:29 - 34:32)
that would lead up to finals each gave (34:31 - 34:36)
out CP the circuit points are exclusive (34:32 - 34:38)
to Korea and have been an independent (34:36 - 34:41)
circuit as well as Japan last IRL event (34:38 - 34:43)
was back in 2019 and the South Korean (34:41 - 34:47)
VGC Community has not seen one since (34:43 - 34:50)
they have only given us an online double (34:47 - 34:52)
elimination trainers cup each year and (34:50 - 34:55)
that was it so now number one last year (34:52 - 34:56)
when Worlds was back players were (34:55 - 34:58)
curious on how Pokemon Korea planned to (34:56 - 35:00)
give in invites no explanations were (34:58 - 35:02)
made they proceeded to do the trainers (35:00 - 35:04)
cup the online tour like before after (35:02 - 35:06)
the tour they suddenly announced that (35:04 - 35:08)
the top four of the trainers cup will be (35:06 - 35:10)
invited to day two of Worlds this was (35:08 - 35:12)
excluding Juniors and seniors the tour (35:10 - 35:15)
is only available for masters that was (35:12 - 35:16)
for the record that's like the same as (35:15 - 35:21)
the US for The Players cup stuff (35:16 - 35:23)
uh this year again they announced (35:21 - 35:24)
nothing until March in March they (35:23 - 35:26)
announced that our circuit will be here (35:24 - 35:29)
so they announced another trainer's cup (35:26 - 35:31)
thing basically they gave invites to (35:29 - 35:33)
trainers cup for the top 50 Korean (35:31 - 35:35)
players of each Global Challenge and (35:33 - 35:38)
then the top 150 players competed in a (35:35 - 35:40)
best of One ladder (35:38 - 35:43)
four top four gets day two top 16 gets (35:40 - 35:46)
day one people were very frustrated that (35:43 - 35:48)
deciding everything in just the 10 games (35:46 - 35:52)
of the latter uh also this is this (35:48 - 35:54)
format is vulnerable to sub-accounts and (35:52 - 35:56)
match manipulation so this is what we (35:54 - 35:58)
said two weeks ago that like if you were (35:56 - 36:00)
a Korean player and you had to sit there (35:58 - 36:03)
you only had 10 matches you won all 10 (36:00 - 36:06)
matches you've qualified for worlds and (36:03 - 36:07)
then all of a sudden the Pokemon company (36:06 - 36:09)
was like actually (36:07 - 36:10)
there was a bug (36:09 - 36:13)
you got to do all 10 matches again (36:10 - 36:17)
and that the bug sucks don't get me (36:13 - 36:18)
wrong like playing the same people over (36:17 - 36:20)
and over are not great but also winning (36:18 - 36:21)
10 matches and then being told you have (36:20 - 36:24)
to do it over again also release yes (36:21 - 36:27)
[Laughter] (36:24 - 36:30)
and and then just like Japan Ray Rizzo (36:27 - 36:32)
experiences as well we had multiple (36:30 - 36:34)
issues people were getting rematched (36:32 - 36:36)
after rematch and could not stop playing (36:34 - 36:38)
during the tour Pokemon Korea decided (36:36 - 36:41)
that the tour was invalid in the top 16 (36:38 - 36:43)
from this tour would get unqualified (36:41 - 36:45)
people who went on to the top 16 here (36:43 - 36:48)
demanded compensation and Pokemon Korea (36:45 - 36:50)
gave them an invite to the next year (36:48 - 36:52)
trainers Cup this is basically nothing (36:50 - 36:54)
since reaching trainer cup was just (36:52 - 36:56)
getting top 1600 in the global challenge (36:54 - 37:00)
uh nothing even close to top cutting (36:56 - 37:02)
this was a devastating message implying (37:00 - 37:05)
our format will remain the way for next (37:02 - 37:07)
year two weeks later we played ladder (37:05 - 37:10)
tour again until it was updated which uh (37:07 - 37:12)
until the update happened that was that (37:10 - 37:15)
emergency update we got (37:12 - 37:19)
okay so Nash blue sense (37:15 - 37:21)
oh gosh I should know how to say this (37:19 - 37:23)
because I was in Korea for like two (37:21 - 37:25)
weeks yeah (37:23 - 37:25)
uh and Mia (37:27 - 37:33)
were the top four of the second ladder (37:30 - 37:35)
tour which means we secured our invites (37:33 - 37:39)
to day two day two is the better day of (37:35 - 37:41)
Worlds by the way (37:39 - 37:41)
um but in order to do that we had to (37:43 - 37:47)
show up at the trainers Cup Final Round (37:45 - 37:50)
a streamed match it's just a final round (37:47 - 37:52)
who decides who goes who is number one (37:50 - 37:54)
and who is number four couple nice (37:52 - 37:55)
prizes (37:54 - 37:57)
we were locked into day two so not much (37:55 - 37:59)
at stake (37:57 - 38:00)
the four of us decided to go into a (37:59 - 38:02)
metronome battle to protest all the (38:00 - 38:04)
issues within our community no IRL (38:02 - 38:05)
events (38:04 - 38:07)
constant problems in the tour (38:05 - 38:09)
disregarding of a younger division (38:07 - 38:11)
that's very nice of them to think of (38:09 - 38:13)
their younger players absurd (38:11 - 38:15)
compensation for the problems that were (38:13 - 38:16)
caused (38:15 - 38:18)
but the real problem behind all of this (38:16 - 38:20)
was the disrespect towards our players (38:18 - 38:23)
during this week Pokemon Korea suddenly (38:20 - 38:25)
sends an email to Blue disqualifying (38:23 - 38:27)
them without saying why when he called (38:25 - 38:29)
to ask why they refused to answer they (38:27 - 38:32)
immediately gave his day two to Beta (38:29 - 38:35)
beta go beta agreed with the three of us (38:32 - 38:37)
to do the metronome battle so we (38:35 - 38:39)
proceeded we had locked in the All We've (38:37 - 38:41)
locked into our in-game online tour (38:39 - 38:43)
system beforehand we did that yesterday (38:41 - 38:44)
second (38:43 - 38:47)
the June 2nd uh we were supposed to (38:44 - 38:50)
battle on the fourth today on the third (38:47 - 38:53)
all four players were sent an email from (38:50 - 38:57)
uh the Pokemon Korea account informing (38:53 - 38:59)
us that all four of us were disqualified (38:57 - 39:01)
their reasoning was all the Pokemon (38:59 - 39:04)
locked in with one learned specific move (39:01 - 39:07)
according to Pokemon Korea This falls (39:04 - 39:09)
into the prohibited Acts (39:07 - 39:13)
This falls into a prohibited act saying (39:09 - 39:15)
um (39:13 - 39:15)
they say an act of harm to other (39:17 - 39:21)
participants giving an offensive image (39:19 - 39:25)
or other actions Nintendo and the (39:21 - 39:27)
Pokemon company and its subsidiaries (39:25 - 39:31)
deem inappropriate Pokemon Korea saw our (39:27 - 39:32)
teams didn't like it therefore (39:31 - 39:34)
disqualified all four of us for playing (39:32 - 39:37)
metronome (39:34 - 39:37)
that's happening yeah (39:41 - 39:45)
so I uh (39:49 - 39:53)
it's (39:54 - 39:58)
just to say that like scarlet and violet (39:55 - 40:01)
is a mess sure (39:58 - 40:04)
very the the game the game has bad frame (40:01 - 40:06)
rates game's a bit buggy they have fixed (40:04 - 40:08)
some stuff to be fair in like the last (40:06 - 40:11)
month my game has not crashed on me (40:08 - 40:12)
um (40:11 - 40:13)
but the (40:12 - 40:16)
the tour stuff has not been (40:13 - 40:19)
any better (40:16 - 40:21)
um and I I remember the first couple (40:19 - 40:25)
U.S VGC tournaments here in the states (40:21 - 40:28)
and I was like why are we why are we (40:25 - 40:29)
still using all of sword and shield (40:28 - 40:32)
branding like why why are they why are (40:29 - 40:33)
they showing zashin and zamazunta on the (40:32 - 40:37)
screen we know that they have quax leaf (40:33 - 40:40)
wayco's frigatito images why are we just (40:37 - 40:42)
not reply like (40:40 - 40:44)
I don't know what's happening I don't (40:42 - 40:47)
know what's happening but like (40:44 - 40:50)
Japan has not been super solid with the (40:47 - 40:53)
ray Rizzo stuff again they had the same (40:50 - 40:56)
format as Korea for some stuff uh this (40:53 - 40:58)
Korea mess we've been following for a (40:56 - 41:01)
little bit it's not getting any better (40:58 - 41:01)
Pokemon go has had its own disaster of (41:02 - 41:08)
people qualifying and stuff so the whole (41:05 - 41:11)
like competitive circuit has not been (41:08 - 41:16)
smooth at all which is if anything I (41:11 - 41:19)
would just say it's a bummer because we (41:16 - 41:21)
had three years of covid (41:19 - 41:23)
people really wanted to compete they (41:21 - 41:24)
really wanted to get in the Pokemon (41:23 - 41:27)
company has done a pretty good job at (41:24 - 41:29)
lowering the barrier of Entry to get in (41:27 - 41:33)
to participate in some ways raising the (41:29 - 41:36)
literal price makes it a little harder (41:33 - 41:40)
God that's true prices are better I (41:36 - 41:42)
guess (41:40 - 41:42)
as someone who would have competed if it (41:44 - 41:50)
didn't cost seventy dollars to compete I (41:46 - 41:54)
mean it yeah it's a lot of money these (41:50 - 41:56)
these days (41:54 - 41:58)
uh I mean I applaud these players for (41:56 - 42:00)
doing what they did (41:58 - 42:02)
oh yeah that's a really cool way to (42:00 - 42:04)
protest (42:02 - 42:06)
they weren't hurting anyone they didn't (42:04 - 42:09)
hack in these Pokemon well I don't know (42:06 - 42:10)
maybe (42:09 - 42:13)
legally all these Pokemon can learn (42:10 - 42:15)
metronome right it wasn't like yeah (42:13 - 42:18)
they they did pick six Pokemon they all (42:15 - 42:20)
could legally learn metronome (42:18 - 42:22)
um they were all guaranteed to go to (42:20 - 42:24)
Worlds so it is a little insulting to (42:22 - 42:26)
like go through with this tournament (42:24 - 42:27)
when (42:26 - 42:30)
to to the four players like that that's (42:27 - 42:31)
like the prizes don't matter at that (42:30 - 42:34)
point like they they would rather have (42:31 - 42:37)
a better tournament scene than to get (42:34 - 42:38)
like (42:37 - 42:41)
two boxes of (42:38 - 42:45)
whatever the last set was gone yeah (42:41 - 42:45)
where (42:48 - 42:53)
I feel like (42:50 - 42:56)
the Pokemon company (42:53 - 42:56)
rode on a wave of (42:57 - 43:02)
really great like like your core game (43:02 - 43:08)
was really good your side games were (43:06 - 43:10)
really good and then (43:08 - 43:13)
with Scarlet Violet hit like the cracks (43:10 - 43:17)
that were there just got wider and they (43:13 - 43:21)
are mostly unprepared on how to actually (43:17 - 43:25)
attempt to make this better because I (43:21 - 43:26)
feel like (43:25 - 43:30)
they have like half a vision of what (43:26 - 43:32)
they want these tours to look like and (43:30 - 43:34)
how they want this to go but they (43:32 - 43:38)
haven't solidified it enough to make (43:34 - 43:41)
really difficult choices they seem to be (43:38 - 43:44)
doing that thing like we have we know (43:41 - 43:47)
what the vibe is so let's make decisions (43:44 - 43:49)
sort of based around the vibe which is (43:47 - 43:52)
like never a good way to sort of start (43:49 - 43:56)
approaching these things and this (43:52 - 43:59)
story it fits in with a edition of a (43:56 - 44:01)
corporation that (43:59 - 44:04)
just does not have a solid vision of how (44:01 - 44:05)
they're gonna how they want to move (44:04 - 44:07)
forward how they're going to fix the (44:05 - 44:10)
actual issues and (44:07 - 44:12)
don't have a way (44:10 - 44:15)
of actually dealing with their customer (44:12 - 44:18)
base right like they just don't have an (44:15 - 44:21)
idea of what they want to do or how to (44:18 - 44:24)
deal with it and I'm going to say that (44:21 - 44:27)
kind of universally across almost every (44:24 - 44:29)
Pokemon product that is happening right (44:27 - 44:30)
now (44:29 - 44:32)
go doesn't have a good idea how to deal (44:30 - 44:33)
with it (44:32 - 44:36)
unite doesn't have a good idea how to do (44:33 - 44:39)
with it really hey Niantic knows for (44:36 - 44:41)
sure they want you outside and walking (44:39 - 44:44)
yeah we'll talk about that uh (44:41 - 44:50)
so like overall I think they are in (44:44 - 44:50)
a very unusual place where you feel like (44:50 - 44:57)
it sort of feels like (44:54 - 45:00)
trying to explain to your well to my (44:57 - 45:03)
parents your grandparents like (45:00 - 45:05)
these are what memes are right like (45:03 - 45:07)
they've heard of it they don't (45:05 - 45:09)
understand the importance of it and they (45:07 - 45:11)
don't see the value of it and they don't (45:09 - 45:14)
understand why people younger than them (45:11 - 45:15)
do (45:14 - 45:17)
and I feel like that is where we're at (45:15 - 45:19)
with the Pokemon company right now like (45:17 - 45:21)
they understand is important but they (45:19 - 45:24)
don't understand why and are not capable (45:21 - 45:28)
of making decisions to fix the actual (45:24 - 45:30)
problems (45:28 - 45:30)
I feel like this is also a (45:33 - 45:41)
we've gotten so big (45:37 - 45:45)
across all all things yeah cards games (45:41 - 45:50)
TV we saw spin-offs we don't have the (45:45 - 45:52)
proper people in place (45:50 - 45:58)
on top of we still have us probably (45:52 - 46:01)
a small amount of people in Japan that (45:58 - 46:03)
make the decisions for everyone we know (46:01 - 46:05)
that this is for sure true because the (46:03 - 46:07)
Pokemon company International still has (46:05 - 46:09)
to get approval from the Pokemon company (46:07 - 46:12)
four things we've talked about how (46:09 - 46:14)
that's affected things before (46:12 - 46:17)
and because Pokemon is so big now it (46:14 - 46:18)
feels like (46:17 - 46:21)
the people up top there's not enough (46:18 - 46:23)
people there (46:21 - 46:25)
to be making decisions quickly enough or (46:23 - 46:28)
adequately enough for this entire (46:25 - 46:30)
company having been in large air (46:28 - 46:32)
Impressions there's plenty of people at (46:30 - 46:33)
the top (46:32 - 46:36)
the issue is is they're unwilling to (46:33 - 46:40)
give up control right like you don't (46:36 - 46:44)
need 50 people to approve anything you (46:40 - 46:47)
need tend to improve the most important (46:44 - 46:49)
things and you need to trust that the (46:47 - 46:51)
people below you are capable of making (46:49 - 46:54)
good decisions that actually support (46:51 - 46:57)
your company and it is 100 a trust issue (46:54 - 47:01)
and the fact that they at the top don't (46:57 - 47:03)
understand why these things are (47:01 - 47:06)
important like you you don't you only (47:03 - 47:10)
ever need one person to say yes (47:06 - 47:13)
that's all you ever need and having a (47:10 - 47:15)
hundred different people tends to mire (47:13 - 47:18)
it down in well you didn't ask the right (47:15 - 47:19)
group (47:18 - 47:22)
that is that is a complicated structure (47:19 - 47:24)
that needs to go away you need to be (47:22 - 47:26)
able to empower the people who are (47:24 - 47:29)
actually running those areas to make (47:26 - 47:32)
decisions without you and they just (47:29 - 47:35)
don't allow that to happen they just (47:32 - 47:37)
have zero (47:35 - 47:40)
faith in their corporate structure and (47:37 - 47:42)
the people that work for them to make (47:40 - 47:45)
the best decisions possible because you (47:42 - 47:46)
can see that in their mind they're (47:45 - 47:49)
trying to avoid Scandal but by having (47:46 - 47:52)
such a delayed process they are creating (47:49 - 47:54)
Scandal like they don't understand that (47:52 - 47:56)
if you loosen up and trust your (47:54 - 47:58)
employees who are in charge of these (47:56 - 47:59)
things (47:58 - 48:01)
you'll get different scandals but you're (47:59 - 48:03)
getting scandals (48:01 - 48:06)
no matter what and you can respond to (48:03 - 48:08)
them faster if you trust your lower (48:06 - 48:11)
employees (48:08 - 48:11)
it's just frustrating because I feel (48:11 - 48:15)
like every time we hear (48:13 - 48:17)
like like (48:15 - 48:21)
obviously the three of us love Pokemon (48:17 - 48:24)
and we report on Pokemon news but like (48:21 - 48:26)
when we report about the competitive (48:24 - 48:29)
side of things we don't report on like (48:26 - 48:31)
well these are the best teams that what (48:29 - 48:33)
like because there are other websites (48:31 - 48:36)
that do that kind of stuff but also like (48:33 - 48:39)
that stuff doesn't ever make it into (48:36 - 48:40)
mainstream right like you're not seeing (48:39 - 48:43)
like a mainstream website report that (48:40 - 48:46)
like pal like this dolphin Pokemon is (48:43 - 48:47)
dominating the VG like you don't see (48:46 - 48:49)
that (48:47 - 48:51)
number five (48:49 - 48:54)
just need another battery soon but but (48:51 - 48:57)
you I feel like any time Pokemon VGC (48:54 - 48:59)
competitive stuff makes mainstream news (48:57 - 49:03)
it's always something terrible and then (48:59 - 49:05)
people on the outside look at and (49:03 - 49:07)
they'll be like yep look at those little (49:05 - 49:09)
kids playing their little Pokemons like (49:07 - 49:11)
of course it's going to be run poorly (49:09 - 49:12)
and it's like (49:11 - 49:16)
this is this is not what we want we we (49:12 - 49:17)
like (49:16 - 49:20)
because there there is such like (49:17 - 49:24)
a skill and there's so many variations (49:20 - 49:26)
of Pokemon and like sometimes you look (49:24 - 49:27)
at a Pokemon team and you're like oh the (49:26 - 49:29)
top four teams all run this dolphin and (49:27 - 49:31)
it's like yeah but their teams are so (49:29 - 49:35)
different behind the dip the dolphin (49:31 - 49:37)
itself and like people play in a certain (49:35 - 49:38)
play style (49:37 - 49:41)
it's like really cool once you get into (49:38 - 49:44)
competitive Pokemon of how like deep and (49:41 - 49:47)
how much skill is there and how (49:44 - 49:51)
complicated of a game it is and it just (49:47 - 49:53)
sucks that every time VGC is brought up (49:51 - 49:56)
as like an esport or like a mainstream (49:53 - 49:58)
thing or like on the same like pedestal (49:56 - 50:02)
of like valorent or or whatever current (49:58 - 50:05)
competitive game is is popular it's (50:02 - 50:08)
we're just like a a joke to people it's (50:05 - 50:09)
just like everyone just points at us and (50:08 - 50:11)
laughs and goes like a bunch of kids (50:09 - 50:15)
playing this video game it's just like (50:11 - 50:17)
like can't help but like blame the (50:15 - 50:19)
Pokemon company of not not treating this (50:17 - 50:21)
as serious as they should be like on the (50:19 - 50:23)
surface it looks like they're treating (50:21 - 50:25)
it serious but as we dive deeper into (50:23 - 50:27)
these problems it's like (50:25 - 50:30)
they don't have a good structure right (50:27 - 50:32)
for these events and for these (50:30 - 50:34)
tournaments and it's just (50:32 - 50:37)
it who wants to pay ninety dollars to be (50:34 - 50:39)
like I don't know this thing's like (50:37 - 50:42)
barely held together it's why I left TCG (50:39 - 50:44)
I like people went people always find (50:42 - 50:46)
the podcast like new people always come (50:44 - 50:49)
in and like even even last week on my (50:46 - 50:51)
twitch stream somebody's like Steve you (50:49 - 50:52)
played the TCG because I was opening (50:51 - 50:55)
booster packs oh by the way the T when (50:52 - 50:59)
this podcast goes up TCG oh is dead they (50:55 - 51:01)
just closed it by the way so that's (50:59 - 51:02)
break breaking news (51:01 - 51:05)
cgo is dead so I had a panic open like (51:02 - 51:08)
500 packs because they would have been (51:05 - 51:11)
not transferred to tcgl so um opening (51:08 - 51:12)
packs somebody's like Steve used to play (51:11 - 51:15)
competitive TCG and I was like for three (51:12 - 51:19)
years every single weekend I would load (51:15 - 51:21)
up a car with my friends and we would (51:19 - 51:25)
drive two to four hours to some sort of (51:21 - 51:27)
city in the middle of nowhere hosting a (51:25 - 51:28)
tournament (51:27 - 51:31)
and we would spend all day get no lunch (51:28 - 51:34)
breaks have the judges make the wildest (51:31 - 51:37)
calls because like who is going to judge (51:34 - 51:40)
the judge we're in the we're in Fond du (51:37 - 51:41)
Lac Wisconsin (51:40 - 51:44)
and this judge is making the wildest (51:41 - 51:47)
like oh I like I guess this is a DQ even (51:44 - 51:49)
though like it shouldn't be a DQ like (51:47 - 51:51)
this is a two prize penalty this should (51:49 - 51:53)
be a DQ why is this a two prize penalty (51:51 - 51:55)
it was just like (51:53 - 51:59)
you the tournament structure not like (51:55 - 52:01)
anyone in particular but the tournament (51:59 - 52:04)
structure is not respecting my time (52:01 - 52:07)
players are bullying judges that sucks (52:04 - 52:09)
like we're getting Gaslight in (52:07 - 52:11)
Massachusetts and no one's doing (52:09 - 52:14)
anything about it and like (52:11 - 52:16)
I'm not even treated like a human being (52:14 - 52:19)
of like can I get a can I get a 15 (52:16 - 52:21)
minute lunch break nope (52:19 - 52:25)
keep playing like who wants to do that (52:21 - 52:27)
yeah (52:25 - 52:30)
yeah it's (52:27 - 52:30)
again they want (52:30 - 52:34)
something that they don't want to invest (52:32 - 52:37)
in (52:34 - 52:37)
because it is (52:37 - 52:41)
it's one of those things where you sort (52:41 - 52:44)
of think like oh they feel like that (52:43 - 52:47)
it's a nice to have this is a nice thing (52:44 - 52:50)
to do for our groups but it's something (52:47 - 52:52)
that's not necessary I feel they should (52:50 - 52:54)
do right they feel like they should be (52:52 - 52:56)
building this out that they feel like (52:54 - 52:58)
it's important to have this be a part of (52:56 - 53:01)
the Pokemon brand but it's not (52:58 - 53:04)
structurally sound they just don't have (53:01 - 53:06)
a view they don't have a vision like you (53:04 - 53:09)
can look at it and go you just don't you (53:06 - 53:12)
don't have training for your judges you (53:09 - 53:14)
don't have consistency you don't have (53:12 - 53:17)
you don't even update your marketing you (53:14 - 53:20)
you don't have these you like you the (53:17 - 53:22)
people who ultimately end up making (53:20 - 53:24)
these decisions don't necessarily (53:22 - 53:25)
understand the decisions that you're (53:24 - 53:27)
making because you're not investing (53:25 - 53:33)
anything into it and it's it is (53:27 - 53:33)
hard to say (53:35 - 53:41)
what they want to do like do they just (53:37 - 53:43)
want it to die (53:41 - 53:45)
do they just no longer think it is (53:43 - 53:47)
especially since covet happened that (53:45 - 53:49)
they just don't feel like this is a (53:47 - 53:51)
viable thing for them anymore there's no (53:49 - 53:53)
way they just want that yeah when you go (53:51 - 53:55)
to them in person it's a bigger and (53:53 - 53:58)
bigger thing every year yeah but it (53:55 - 54:01)
the the thing is is like (53:58 - 54:04)
that's the two messages that you have (54:01 - 54:07)
you want it big but you also feel like (54:04 - 54:08)
you want it to not exist anymore because (54:07 - 54:12)
you don't invest in it so they are stuck (54:08 - 54:16)
in this weird parallel of yeah this is (54:12 - 54:18)
really important but not important for (54:16 - 54:20)
enough for us to pay attention to it in (54:18 - 54:24)
in a meaningful way (54:20 - 54:24)
I don't know how like (54:24 - 54:28)
Street Fighter or Tekken or League of (54:26 - 54:32)
Legends or valorant I don't know how (54:28 - 54:34)
their tournament structures are run on (54:32 - 54:35)
the back end (54:34 - 54:36)
um I'm not in those scenes but maybe if (54:35 - 54:38)
I was more deep in those scenes we would (54:36 - 54:40)
hear like similar issues of (54:38 - 54:44)
I mean I'm fairly I mean I'm I'm surface (54:40 - 54:46)
level deep in magic in this from what I (54:44 - 54:47)
can tell they are run (54:46 - 54:50)
immensely better than this (54:47 - 54:51)
like (54:50 - 54:54)
they are they are pretty strict about (54:51 - 54:55)
things you know they have solid (54:54 - 54:57)
rotations they have exact formats they (54:55 - 55:00)
have you know the exact same judges and (54:57 - 55:03)
I I I will say from my limited (55:00 - 55:06)
experience I have rarely heard (55:03 - 55:10)
the same quality of issues on the magic (55:06 - 55:12)
tournament that I hear in the Pokemon (55:10 - 55:15)
TCG tournament (55:12 - 55:17)
um (55:15 - 55:20)
but if like (55:17 - 55:22)
I feel like this this season is already (55:20 - 55:24)
the the ship has already sailed right (55:22 - 55:28)
we're we're dealing up for yeah (55:24 - 55:28)
but like I can't even I can't even stop (55:28 - 55:33)
thinking about like tuning into the (55:31 - 55:36)
first stream tournament because I think (55:33 - 55:38)
I I like I like like I love having those (55:36 - 55:40)
on in the weekend like I'm I'm cleaning (55:38 - 55:41)
the house (55:40 - 55:44)
um like putting furniture together that (55:41 - 55:45)
I should have put together a year ago (55:44 - 55:48)
and then I have it on the background and (55:45 - 55:50)
then like something exciting happens and (55:48 - 55:51)
you look and there's plenty of down time (55:50 - 55:53)
in between matches which is both a good (55:51 - 55:55)
and bad thing but like (55:53 - 55:58)
I was just so blown away that like when (55:55 - 56:01)
that first two like two tournaments but (55:58 - 56:03)
they haven't changed it by the way and (56:01 - 56:05)
like I'm seeing everything like Sashi (56:03 - 56:08)
and zamasenta like like stonejourner and (56:05 - 56:10)
I'm like they didn't upgrade the gra (56:08 - 56:12)
like the the title cards or anything (56:10 - 56:14)
they're still using the same stuff like (56:12 - 56:17)
this is a brand new game like how is (56:14 - 56:21)
this not a priority and then literally (56:17 - 56:24)
like a month later Wolfie Glick did his (56:21 - 56:26)
Invitational with a bunch of content (56:24 - 56:29)
creators Wolfie like a very good player (56:26 - 56:31)
um and I was like oh let's tune into (56:29 - 56:34)
this and the production quality of that (56:31 - 56:37)
thing was mind-blowing it was so good (56:34 - 56:40)
and I was like this guy is just not just (56:37 - 56:41)
a YouTuber like Wolfie click is very (56:40 - 56:43)
great like makes good YouTube content (56:41 - 56:46)
very good player but I was like (56:43 - 56:48)
this is insulting like the Pokemon (56:46 - 56:52)
company is a billion dollar company that (56:48 - 56:54)
should be at like one you just have to I (56:52 - 56:56)
know it's not as easy as just just do (56:54 - 56:58)
this but like when you're starting a (56:56 - 57:00)
brand new game for a brand new season (56:58 - 57:02)
something that's going to go for pretty (57:00 - 57:04)
much a full year from October to August (57:02 - 57:07)
there wasn't any pre-planning of like (57:04 - 57:10)
what is our what is our tournament (57:07 - 57:13)
structure visually going to look like on (57:10 - 57:15)
all of these twitch streams that we have (57:13 - 57:17)
planned which is what (57:15 - 57:19)
20 plus like it feels like it's almost (57:17 - 57:20)
every weekend there's a tournament (57:19 - 57:21)
somewhere (57:20 - 57:22)
and like (57:21 - 57:25)
we don't have anyone to sit there and (57:22 - 57:27)
just okay let's replace (57:25 - 57:30)
the zombies enter with play Coco like (57:27 - 57:32)
let's like make the colors purple and (57:30 - 57:33)
orange because that's what scarlet and (57:32 - 57:35)
violet is not red and blue which was (57:33 - 57:37)
sword and shield like no one thought of (57:35 - 57:39)
that this is this is what makes me laugh (57:37 - 57:41)
is this is exactly the same thing that (57:39 - 57:44)
happened so I went out to LA and did d d (57:41 - 57:46)
live in 2019. (57:44 - 57:48)
so I did that all of us sort of (57:46 - 57:50)
community streamer people actual people (57:48 - 57:54)
went out there ran side streams for them (57:50 - 57:58)
live essentially for free we I did not (57:54 - 58:00)
get paid I had to pay my entire way out (57:58 - 58:02)
there whatever 2020 everybody's gearing (58:00 - 58:04)
up again and they're like (58:02 - 58:07)
Community people where where none of you (58:04 - 58:10)
can come it's online only because of (58:07 - 58:12)
covid none of you are invited and we're (58:10 - 58:15)
gonna just do all celebrities (58:12 - 58:17)
it was (58:15 - 58:20)
shocking at how bad it was cameras (58:17 - 58:22)
falling over they were doing a cooking (58:20 - 58:24)
show and the camera was never focused on (58:22 - 58:26)
the food I mean people streamers in the (58:24 - 58:28)
community were sitting there like oh (58:26 - 58:30)
everybody who watched it I was talking (58:28 - 58:32)
friends like we all know how to fix all (58:30 - 58:33)
of this (58:32 - 58:35)
and they just said oh we'll just do the (58:33 - 58:37)
house because it looks so easy it's the (58:35 - 58:40)
same sort of issue it's like you know (58:37 - 58:43)
get these people to do it but again (58:40 - 58:45)
nobody wants to work for free and you (58:43 - 58:46)
are going to have to pay these people (58:45 - 58:48)
something and it's obvious when you (58:46 - 58:50)
don't want to spend the money it's (58:48 - 58:53)
obvious because the quality suffers so (58:50 - 58:54)
greatly from people who do it in their (58:53 - 58:59)
spare time for free because they love it (58:54 - 59:00)
and then you see them do it (58:59 - 59:02)
professionally and you're like this is (59:00 - 59:05)
laughable how bad it is and these are (59:02 - 59:07)
famous people who are used to acting who (59:05 - 59:10)
should know how to run cameras and it is (59:07 - 59:13)
shocking because they just didn't (59:10 - 59:16)
take the time or effort just we're like (59:13 - 59:18)
well just just do whatever (59:16 - 59:20)
and that's the same feeling I get a lot (59:18 - 59:21)
of times when I see things it's like (59:20 - 59:22)
somebody's and they're like well we (59:21 - 59:23)
don't have time we don't want to pay for (59:22 - 59:26)
so just do whatever again that is the (59:23 - 59:28)
problem of just deciding it's not (59:26 - 59:31)
important enough to invest in big events (59:28 - 59:34)
are hard and easily underestimated oh (59:31 - 59:37)
yeah and I helped with my mom's wedding (59:34 - 59:40)
a year ago and that was hard just making (59:37 - 59:42)
sure everything was set up making sure (59:40 - 59:44)
things didn't fall through the cracks (59:42 - 59:47)
it's so easy for something small or (59:44 - 59:49)
something that you're not looking at as (59:47 - 59:50)
you're setting up to fall through the (59:49 - 59:54)
cracks I had for my wedding my friend (59:50 - 59:56)
Anne agreed (59:54 - 59:58)
thankfully he's one of my best friends (59:56 - 60:01)
but she is a stage manager as a (59:58 - 60:02)
professioner she was she's gotten out of (60:01 - 60:04)
it since then (60:02 - 60:07)
on top of literally everything I mean (60:04 - 60:10)
she was she so if you ever see if you (60:07 - 60:12)
watch the half bull half-time show for (60:10 - 60:14)
the Super Bowl of 1993 that was in (60:12 - 60:16)
Minnesota she was a stage manager for (60:14 - 60:19)
that uh it's hilarious it was the last (60:16 - 60:21)
one it was so it's so bad it's called (60:19 - 60:23)
winter magic watch it is one of the (60:21 - 60:25)
worst things you'll ever have watched uh (60:23 - 60:29)
but like she like as a professional knew (60:25 - 60:31)
it all the things that I didn't (60:29 - 60:34)
no for sure like I have some ideas of (60:31 - 60:36)
how it's supposed to work no she was (60:34 - 60:37)
like nope we could do this this I'm (60:36 - 60:39)
going to be standing by the DJ for this (60:37 - 60:41)
write up your sound cues write up the (60:39 - 60:42)
timing what words they should come after (60:41 - 60:45)
get this done and then I'm going to meet (60:42 - 60:46)
with these people we're going to talk (60:45 - 60:48)
about when the tables need to be moved (60:46 - 60:48)
like (60:48 - 60:51)
that sort of organizational brain is so (60:48 - 60:53)
important and when they just decide not (60:51 - 60:55)
to invest in that person you're like (60:53 - 60:56)
well this is why it's a mess because (60:55 - 61:00)
nobody knows what should be happening (60:56 - 61:03)
and what is necessary to happen like (61:00 - 61:04)
they've existed for years they're called (61:03 - 61:06)
stage managers and production managers (61:04 - 61:10)
but they cost money (61:06 - 61:10)
yeah I mean this goes back to like now (61:12 - 61:16)
me thinking about like the twitch chat (61:14 - 61:20)
and how like it is so hard to watch some (61:16 - 61:22)
of these tournaments because the for (61:20 - 61:25)
what I I don't know for sure but I am (61:22 - 61:28)
assuming that the Poke mods Pokemon 4 (61:25 - 61:30)
Pokemon 7 or whatever in twitch chat are (61:28 - 61:33)
just volunteers or just people that work (61:30 - 61:35)
at the Pokemon company that were told (61:33 - 61:36)
hey you need to watch the the twitch (61:35 - 61:39)
chat this weekend but in reality none of (61:36 - 61:42)
them managing twitch chat knows how to (61:39 - 61:44)
manage a twitch chat yeah and it is (61:42 - 61:46)
inferior like there was a there was a (61:44 - 61:50)
trans player who who won her match and (61:46 - 61:52)
uh (61:50 - 61:56)
twitch chat is like is it he she her oh (61:52 - 61:58)
like the standard like (61:56 - 62:00)
trans stuff that yeah just all the (61:58 - 62:02)
misgendering all of the horrible (62:00 - 62:06)
horrible and nothing was moderated not a (62:02 - 62:08)
single thing was moderated for for that (62:06 - 62:10)
trans player and it absolutely sucked (62:08 - 62:12)
and that that's like one issue (62:10 - 62:14)
and I've talked about this before there (62:12 - 62:15)
was an issue where like the stream went (62:14 - 62:17)
out and somebody somebody made like a (62:15 - 62:19)
bomb threat and they were like oh a (62:17 - 62:20)
stream went up because they found a bomb (62:19 - 62:22)
in the convention center and that person (62:20 - 62:24)
didn't like that person got a 10 minute (62:22 - 62:26)
ban and they came back in 10 minutes and (62:24 - 62:28)
started saying more terrible jokes like (62:26 - 62:31)
no that that this is not how we moderate (62:28 - 62:33)
twitch chats right like there was an (62:31 - 62:35)
instance where everyone was spamming and (62:33 - 62:37)
an emote it wasn't even like an (62:35 - 62:38)
offensive emote it was just like a silly (62:37 - 62:41)
emote so of course the moderator started (62:38 - 62:43)
timing out the people doing the emote so (62:41 - 62:45)
more people started doing the emote and (62:43 - 62:47)
it's like no just let twitch chat run it (62:45 - 62:49)
like it's just a silly emote that they (62:47 - 62:51)
were Banning for the they get bored very (62:49 - 62:53)
easy I promise you if you would have (62:51 - 62:55)
left it they would have been they would (62:53 - 62:57)
have been bored in five minutes and gone (62:55 - 62:59)
back to the thing but because you were (62:57 - 63:01)
timing out people using the E-boat more (62:59 - 63:03)
people wanted to use the emote this is (63:01 - 63:08)
like basic twitch 101 like like (63:03 - 63:11)
higher people pay them twenty dollars an (63:08 - 63:13)
hour to sit there for your eight hour (63:11 - 63:17)
stream who actually know how twitch chat (63:13 - 63:19)
works and have your like three twitch (63:17 - 63:22)
chat people on the same page have them (63:19 - 63:24)
in their own group chat being like hey (63:22 - 63:27)
what are we moderating so we're all (63:24 - 63:29)
moderating the same if somebody makes a (63:27 - 63:32)
offensive trans joke do not ban them for (63:29 - 63:34)
10 minutes ban them for the entire (63:32 - 63:38)
weekend for 48 hours like I I get that (63:34 - 63:39)
the Pokemon company doesn't want to like (63:38 - 63:42)
permanently ban people but like (63:39 - 63:44)
if you want to give them Second Chances (63:42 - 63:45)
which I don't think you should but if (63:44 - 63:47)
you do want to give them second chances (63:45 - 63:49)
at least ban them for that specific (63:47 - 63:51)
tournament 48 hours and see if they get (63:49 - 63:53)
better the next tournament like right (63:51 - 63:56)
like surprise if because I know these (63:53 - 63:57)
people do not know how to use twitch (63:56 - 63:59)
chat you can actually click their name (63:57 - 64:02)
and see why they were banned and who (63:59 - 64:04)
banned them and you could leave a note (64:02 - 64:07)
and like hey why was this guy timed out (64:04 - 64:10)
for 10 minutes oh he left a box he made (64:07 - 64:12)
a bomb threat joke there's nothing funny (64:10 - 64:15)
about that like why why was this 10 (64:12 - 64:18)
minutes and not permanent why like like (64:15 - 64:21)
it makes again it goes back to like this (64:18 - 64:23)
whole Korea thing your tournament (64:21 - 64:26)
structure is kind of a joke and it's why (64:23 - 64:28)
people point at us and like laugh at us (64:26 - 64:32)
because like they're they're like (64:28 - 64:34)
these are not easy issues to solve by (64:32 - 64:37)
the way like I I get it but like if you (64:34 - 64:40)
want a serious (64:37 - 64:41)
professional (64:40 - 64:43)
like (64:41 - 64:46)
tournament structure you need to invest (64:43 - 64:48)
in it you need to invest in like the (64:46 - 64:50)
right people you need to pay people you (64:48 - 64:53)
need to like stop relying on volunteers (64:50 - 64:56)
or just like hey moderate twitch chat (64:53 - 64:58)
you you don't use twitch on a daily (64:56 - 65:00)
basis Ah that's okay you'll figure it (64:58 - 65:04)
out no yeah you won't figure it out (65:00 - 65:06)
like the like even twitch chat and (65:04 - 65:10)
YouTube chat are such different (65:06 - 65:11)
like (65:10 - 65:13)
Vibes I don't know that it's really hard (65:11 - 65:15)
to explain but like they're very (65:13 - 65:16)
different (65:15 - 65:18)
um (65:16 - 65:20)
I don't know we can't keep talking about (65:18 - 65:21)
this it's making me mad I'm thinking (65:20 - 65:23)
about everything (65:21 - 65:25)
there's a lot wrong there's a lot that (65:23 - 65:29)
needs to be fixed but what I mean it is (65:25 - 65:31)
it is (65:29 - 65:34)
moderation problems are not limited to (65:31 - 65:36)
just the Pokemon company (65:34 - 65:40)
and again it is a constant issue across (65:36 - 65:42)
all aspects of almost every business (65:40 - 65:45)
that you do not understand you don't (65:42 - 65:48)
have an idea of what you want to be as a (65:45 - 65:50)
company and so you do not know how to (65:48 - 65:54)
moderate correctly and you are unwilling (65:50 - 65:56)
to pay for the people that can help you (65:54 - 66:00)
do that and it's frustrating (65:56 - 66:00)
what's not frustrating is our break yeah (66:00 - 66:05)
it's refreshing (66:04 - 66:07)
when we come back we had some Pokemon Go (66:05 - 66:09)
stuff to talk about so we will be right (66:07 - 66:09)
back (66:09 - 66:22)
[Music] (66:09 - 66:27)
and we are back from our break uh we had (66:22 - 66:29)
a couple Pokemon go things to go over (66:27 - 66:33)
they launched a new season (66:29 - 66:34)
um I guess before we get to the new (66:33 - 66:36)
season I want to talk about the good (66:34 - 66:40)
thing that happened which was the (66:36 - 66:42)
well the new season I think is all (66:40 - 66:45)
relatively exciting yeah it's a pretty (66:42 - 66:47)
good thing we got a dunk on Niantic (66:45 - 66:49)
eventually but before we dunk a Niantic (66:47 - 66:50)
um (66:49 - 66:55)
the searching for gold research day was (66:50 - 67:01)
probably the best event they've done (66:55 - 67:05)
gosh in like since the Fairy stuff I (67:01 - 67:07)
think since the the Dedenne event it (67:05 - 67:10)
might even be better than that honestly (67:07 - 67:12)
yeah I preferred the fairy and dragon (67:10 - 67:15)
event personally but it was a really (67:12 - 67:17)
good event I know that with the last (67:15 - 67:20)
research day they kinda (67:17 - 67:21)
went in a different direction and had (67:20 - 67:24)
weirder harder to accomplish tasks (67:21 - 67:27)
for that day and they brought it back (67:24 - 67:29)
for This research day so you could (67:27 - 67:30)
actually accomplish the tasks quickly (67:29 - 67:32)
you could actually be encountering these (67:30 - 67:33)
Pokemon that you're looking for more (67:32 - 67:36)
quickly and as a result people got more (67:33 - 67:38)
shinies (67:36 - 67:41)
yeah so if they I will say they did a (67:38 - 67:43)
pretty bad job at advertising this event (67:41 - 67:46)
it was the first thing in the new season (67:43 - 67:47)
yeah (67:46 - 67:50)
I I do feel bad if if you if you missed (67:47 - 67:52)
this event because it it was pretty good (67:50 - 67:54)
this morning I got another notification (67:52 - 67:55)
on my phone that the golden event (67:54 - 67:57)
happened yesterday (67:55 - 68:00)
[Laughter] (67:57 - 68:02)
so this was on Saturday June 3rd it was (68:00 - 68:04)
from two to five uh the featured Pokemon (68:02 - 68:07)
were Caterpie Magikarp nose pass Sable I (68:04 - 68:09)
barboach if you're like why are they (68:07 - 68:11)
that those Pokemon don't make sense they (68:09 - 68:13)
all they're all their shinies are gold (68:11 - 68:14)
so there you go now it doesn't make (68:13 - 68:15)
sense (68:14 - 68:16)
um (68:15 - 68:20)
uh pokestops may turn gold without a (68:16 - 68:22)
golden lure uh but roaming gamingual (68:20 - 68:24)
won't appear at those golden pokestops (68:22 - 68:27)
unless somebody uses a golden lure (68:24 - 68:29)
and then Pokemon in the wild would be (68:27 - 68:31)
Weedle Bellsprout pucciana (68:29 - 68:34)
weasel time pole Shelmet Stuffle (68:31 - 68:36)
um some trainers might find a Lickitung (68:35 - 68:38)
or an azumerel I actually had I never (68:36 - 68:39)
saw an azumero but I saw plenty of (68:38 - 68:42)
Lickitung uh all of those Pokemon can be (68:39 - 68:45)
gold except except for whatever the (68:42 - 68:47)
zoomarell yeah zumerel is listed as not (68:45 - 68:52)
being shiny so I mean shiny is gold (68:47 - 68:56)
you can't catch it as a shiny (68:52 - 68:56)
um and then they they put out a dollar (68:57 - 69:02)
ticket which full disclosure I paid for (68:59 - 69:04)
my dollar ticket I gave Niantic my (69:02 - 69:06)
dollar sometimes I had to gives me free (69:05 - 69:08)
tickets so I just want to fully disclose (69:06 - 69:10)
that I I did pay for it myself (69:08 - 69:14)
um I did not and I still loved the event (69:10 - 69:16)
I feel like the ticket was just sort of (69:14 - 69:18)
an add-on (69:16 - 69:20)
I like the ticket was really cool so did (69:18 - 69:21)
you know how the ticket worked yep if (69:20 - 69:22)
you were looking for one specific (69:21 - 69:24)
Pokemon (69:22 - 69:26)
yeah so for those that don't uh didn't (69:24 - 69:28)
it was like I think it was there was two (69:26 - 69:30)
parts to the ticket the first part was (69:28 - 69:33)
just do five tasks (69:30 - 69:36)
um and then each of those tasks gave you (69:33 - 69:38)
one gave you a Caterpie one gave you a (69:36 - 69:39)
Magikarp nose pass stable I bar brooch (69:38 - 69:42)
and then once you did those five (69:39 - 69:44)
um and you got those five encounters the (69:42 - 69:46)
second part would ask which one you (69:44 - 69:48)
cared about the most (69:46 - 69:50)
so like for me I didn't have any shiny (69:48 - 69:52)
nose pass I have seven million Shiny (69:50 - 69:53)
Magikarp I have like three shiny (69:52 - 69:55)
Caterpie I have like six Chinese (69:53 - 69:58)
stabilized two shiny barbwich don't need (69:55 - 69:59)
no one no one ever needs more than two (69:58 - 70:01)
shiny barboats (69:59 - 70:04)
but I was like I got no nose pass so I (70:01 - 70:05)
clicked nose pass so then I gave you 10 (70:04 - 70:09)
more tasks and those were all the they (70:05 - 70:10)
were all they would all be that Pokemon (70:09 - 70:13)
so you have 10 chances of getting 10 (70:10 - 70:15)
more nose pass encounters for me and I (70:13 - 70:17)
ended up getting two shiny nose pass (70:15 - 70:20)
from the ten so that was nice (70:17 - 70:21)
um (70:20 - 70:23)
and yeah so there was boosted shiny ads (70:21 - 70:25)
I don't know what they were Niantic will (70:23 - 70:27)
never tell us they felt like 1 in 20ish (70:25 - 70:29)
maybe one in (70:27 - 70:30)
40ish (70:29 - 70:32)
they felt very good yeah (70:30 - 70:34)
they definitely felt like great shiny (70:32 - 70:37)
odds the one of the first (70:34 - 70:39)
uh research tasks I finished was not (70:37 - 70:42)
only a shiny Magikarp but a huge Shiny (70:39 - 70:44)
Magikarp and that was a very exciting (70:42 - 70:45)
beginning (70:44 - 70:46)
[Music] (70:45 - 70:49)
Biggie Biggie (70:46 - 70:50)
dang (70:49 - 70:52)
um yeah I actually only played the event (70:50 - 70:54)
for an hour because it was very hot (70:52 - 70:57)
um so uh Niantic we're docking points (70:54 - 71:00)
off how dare you turn up the temperature (70:57 - 71:04)
here on your event day (71:00 - 71:05)
um I only played I've played for like an (71:04 - 71:07)
hour 15 (71:05 - 71:10)
um and I loved it it was I I got like (71:07 - 71:12)
200 300 gimme ghoul coins because other (71:10 - 71:14)
people were putting down Golden Lures (71:12 - 71:18)
there were defaults the golden pokestops (71:14 - 71:20)
part was the part that seemed a little (71:18 - 71:21)
bit lacking (71:20 - 71:23)
that I felt there could have been more (71:21 - 71:25)
around and maybe you just had more (71:23 - 71:27)
because people were putting lures down I (71:25 - 71:28)
don't think anyone put a lure down in (71:27 - 71:30)
their area (71:28 - 71:34)
I came across maybe two golden pokestops (71:30 - 71:36)
and I played two out of the three hours (71:34 - 71:38)
and watched I mean people aren't made (71:36 - 71:43)
out of money those goldenders cost a ton (71:38 - 71:43)
by that Greg means they cost (71:43 - 71:47)
incredibly expensive to manufacture (71:49 - 71:54)
in-game uh if Niantic would put a price (71:51 - 71:57)
on them I'm sure they would be (71:54 - 71:57)
hey I put out a magnetic lure I wanted (71:58 - 72:02)
to evolve a nose pass so maybe other (72:00 - 72:06)
people have all their nose passes (72:02 - 72:06)
um it was just a really good event like (72:06 - 72:12)
I I do think I mean cranking up the (72:09 - 72:14)
Golden Lures a bit would would help but (72:12 - 72:15)
uh at least in the area I played with I (72:14 - 72:18)
think because there were Golden Lures it (72:15 - 72:20)
inspired people to be like oh yeah I (72:18 - 72:22)
have one I should put it down (72:20 - 72:24)
um and then if people didn't have one (72:22 - 72:25)
there were plenty of regular lures that (72:24 - 72:28)
were up to in in my area so (72:25 - 72:31)
um it it did really feel (72:28 - 72:33)
like people were out like a community (72:31 - 72:35)
day (72:33 - 72:37)
um and (72:35 - 72:42)
I thought the Pokemon selection was good (72:37 - 72:43)
um people really like Sable I people (72:42 - 72:45)
like butter-free you know I don't know (72:43 - 72:48)
how many people have barboats or not but (72:45 - 72:49)
you know for me somebody who's playing (72:48 - 72:51)
every day I didn't have a nose pass I (72:49 - 72:52)
tried to get a nose pass when I was in (72:51 - 72:54)
Vegas it didn't happen (72:52 - 72:55)
um (72:54 - 72:57)
the selection of like wild Pokemon like (72:55 - 72:59)
Poochyena Bells brought weasel like I (72:57 - 73:00)
thought the Pokemon selection were good (72:59 - 73:02)
I thought that like the theme of the (73:00 - 73:03)
event of all them being gold was good (73:02 - 73:06)
the the Golden Lures were good (73:03 - 73:08)
um like more of this like this is good (73:06 - 73:12)
yes I mean this is going back to an (73:08 - 73:14)
event that has historically been good (73:12 - 73:16)
the research days are good they changed (73:14 - 73:17)
it up a little bit by adding this cool (73:16 - 73:21)
colored based theme and they focused a (73:17 - 73:23)
lot on Pokemon that were kind of rare (73:21 - 73:25)
shinies in the past so yes this this was (73:23 - 73:26)
great (73:25 - 73:29)
this event was better than all of rising (73:26 - 73:32)
Heroes it was though (73:29 - 73:36)
seriously but But Rising Heroes had (73:32 - 73:38)
Heroes that Rose (73:36 - 73:40)
Rising Heroes you got one Ella kid (73:38 - 73:42)
wearing a bracelet that you couldn't see (73:40 - 73:44)
did you see it I had to change the way I (73:42 - 73:46)
am naming my naming scheme for my (73:44 - 73:49)
shinies just because you can't see that (73:46 - 73:53)
costumed Pokemon at all (73:49 - 73:53)
um yeah and uh and I think that I think (73:53 - 73:57)
the dollar was worth it to people who (73:55 - 73:59)
were okay spending a dollar and I think (73:57 - 74:01)
that if you didn't spend the dollar you (73:59 - 74:03)
still got a good event it wasn't like (74:01 - 74:05)
one of those things where like oh the (74:03 - 74:07)
dollar people got better shiny odds or (74:05 - 74:08)
they like (74:07 - 74:10)
it wasn't that it was you know you got a (74:08 - 74:12)
couple more encounters (74:10 - 74:15)
um and if you were really focused on you (74:12 - 74:17)
know trying to get that nose pass like I (74:15 - 74:19)
got a nose pass outside of spending the (74:17 - 74:20)
dollar (74:19 - 74:21)
um I think I ended up with like three of (74:20 - 74:23)
them so (74:21 - 74:23)
but yeah it didn't feel necessary it (74:25 - 74:30)
felt like a fun thing you could do if (74:28 - 74:32)
you were looking for a specific Pokemon (74:30 - 74:34)
and (74:32 - 74:36)
that that felt perfect (74:34 - 74:38)
I think the the only thing they could (74:36 - 74:39)
have maybe done better is like advertise (74:38 - 74:40)
this a little bit better but I guess (74:39 - 74:41)
maybe that's a double-edged sword (74:40 - 74:44)
whether like it hyped it up too much (74:41 - 74:46)
because I had no expectations going in (74:44 - 74:48)
maybe that's why I liked it so much (74:46 - 74:50)
because my expectations were on the (74:48 - 74:51)
floor (74:50 - 74:54)
good the research days are usually some (74:51 - 74:56)
of the better events it was just the (74:54 - 74:59)
last one that had some issues yeah but (74:56 - 75:01)
like this is a good example of like (74:59 - 75:04)
you've made your game fun and you didn't (75:01 - 75:08)
rely on raids yes exactly (75:04 - 75:11)
and they need to stop having every (75:08 - 75:14)
single new feature like Mega's Ultra (75:11 - 75:17)
beasts Shadow Pokemon they all just rely (75:14 - 75:20)
on raids now well Shadow Pokemon didn't (75:17 - 75:22)
use the rely on parades but the last of (75:20 - 75:24)
it they relied on rights (75:22 - 75:26)
they're very (75:24 - 75:26)
very interview but I think they're very (75:27 - 75:30)
stuck (75:28 - 75:30)
go outside and I think they might be (75:31 - 75:35)
having some trouble thinking farther (75:34 - 75:37)
outside of that box (75:35 - 75:38)
yeah (75:37 - 75:40)
yep (75:38 - 75:40)
if uh if and when they ever do Z moves (75:41 - 75:46)
because I think they will (75:44 - 75:50)
if they also put that behind raids uh (75:46 - 75:51)
there are so many other ways you could (75:50 - 75:53)
maybe not (75:51 - 75:54)
even I would need to think about that (75:53 - 75:55)
more (75:54 - 75:57)
uh okay (75:55 - 76:00)
let's talk about this uh season (75:57 - 76:03)
the season of uh what's it called hidden (76:00 - 76:06)
gems yep (76:03 - 76:06)
the season of hidden gems the season (76:06 - 76:10)
where we all know which Pokemon is (76:08 - 76:13)
coming with uh go Fest (76:10 - 76:13)
yeah is there is there not a general (76:13 - 76:20)
blog post about hidden gems nope there (76:16 - 76:22)
is not it is just an infographic on (76:20 - 76:24)
Twitter they stopped doing the blog (76:22 - 76:25)
posts (76:24 - 76:26)
there's a calendar where they (76:25 - 76:28)
accidentally leaked some of the future (76:26 - 76:29)
events that they didn't mean to talk (76:28 - 76:33)
about that's true I mean if you lick it (76:29 - 76:34)
yourself then you don't have to worry (76:33 - 76:36)
about random discords leaking it correct (76:34 - 76:39)
that's the (76:36 - 76:39)
it's like a pretty good season (76:40 - 76:45)
yeah so uh they we we will have a (76:42 - 76:47)
festival Beach week coming up (76:45 - 76:50)
um uh which will debut sandygas and Palo (76:47 - 76:53)

uh you'll be able to find Sandy Gan and (76:57 - 77:02)
Palo sand Palestine is just 50 Sandy gas (77:00 - 77:04)

trainers around the world will have to (77:12 - 77:16)
throw 300 million nice throws to unlock (77:14 - 77:19)
bonuses for everyone uh if we do that (77:16 - 77:20)
you'll get increased candy for nice (77:19 - 77:22)

Mantyke like tyke to teen and then (77:45 - 77:49)
hopefully in gen 10 we'll get mandalt (77:47 - 77:52)
we're all very much awaiting the mandal (77:49 - 77:54)
to debut (77:52 - 77:56)
research encounters will be Lapras (77:54 - 77:58)
wearing a scarf not to be confused with (77:56 - 78:01)
the Lapras wearing the weird hair tie (77:58 - 78:03)
thing that you could only get one of (78:01 - 78:05)
it's not a hair clip it's also not (78:03 - 78:08)
really a scarf it's yeah it's definitely (78:05 - 78:11)
a ribbon it's not this who's working at (78:08 - 78:13)
Niantic do we not know the difference of (78:11 - 78:15)
a scarf and a ribbon it's a bow tie if (78:13 - 78:18)
anything else it's a bow tie so field (78:15 - 78:21)
research will give you Lapras frillish (78:18 - 78:25)
binacle Bionicle by nickel Bionicle (78:21 - 78:28)
clauncher Sandy gas (78:25 - 78:29)
um (78:28 - 78:31)
certain field research will give you (78:29 - 78:34)
Mega Energy for Blastoise and Swampert (78:31 - 78:37)
spotlights for (78:34 - 78:38)
oh wait is this the whole is Spotlight (78:37 - 78:41)
hour multiple Pokemon it is yep because (78:38 - 78:44)
it was within the Water festival okay so (78:41 - 78:45)
that's your Spotlight hour your special (78:44 - 78:48)
Spotlight will be crabby Kabuto core (78:45 - 78:50)
fish clauncher and crab brawler (78:48 - 78:54)
uh Rainey lures will last four four (78:50 - 78:56)
times (78:54 - 78:58)
so two hours instead of 30 minutes (78:56 - 78:59)
I don't know why they just don't say (78:58 - 79:02)
that this time is universal (78:59 - 79:04)
there will be a time to research for (79:02 - 79:06)
five dollars for the low low price okay (79:04 - 79:08)
Greg let me see if we can convince you (79:06 - 79:09)
to get this five dollar research here we (79:08 - 79:11)
go (79:09 - 79:13)
uh when you complete the research you (79:11 - 79:17)
will earn a surfer pose on your avatar (79:13 - 79:20)
I'm watching it in action it is terrible (79:17 - 79:23)
you don't like the Beach Boys (79:20 - 79:23)
that I hate above all others and that (79:26 - 79:33)
band is the Beach Boys (79:31 - 79:37)
hate with a fiery passion everything (79:33 - 79:41)
that Beach Boys does and this includes (79:37 - 79:44)
Christmas music I make a lot of (79:41 - 79:47)
allowances a lot of allowances for (79:44 - 79:48)
Christmas (79:47 - 79:52)
never for the Beach Boys they are (79:48 - 79:55)
horrifying to me (79:52 - 79:58)
well uh on the plus side Greg you only (79:55 - 80:02)
get the pose so I guess you're out I (79:58 - 80:03)
mean you get things to do right like (80:02 - 80:05)
that's the whole point of research is (80:03 - 80:06)
like do these 18 things and at the end (80:05 - 80:09)
you get the pose I like paying somebody (80:06 - 80:11)
to give me a bunch of tasks I have to do (80:09 - 80:16)
that is my ideal transaction so I should (80:11 - 80:19)
just go and be like hey mortgage company (80:16 - 80:21)
here's twenty dollars because I have to (80:19 - 80:23)
clean my house (80:21 - 80:25)
I actually like having more things to do (80:23 - 80:27)
in Pokemon go I would consider the (80:25 - 80:30)
research if I liked the pose because I (80:27 - 80:31)
generally do like poses this one looks (80:30 - 80:35)
silly it's bad (80:31 - 80:37)
it looks like they're drunk it looks (80:35 - 80:40)
like they just they are so wasted that (80:37 - 80:43)
they have no idea how to stand anymore I (80:40 - 80:44)
think you've convinced some people not (80:43 - 80:48)
out get it probably (80:44 - 80:48)
uh your one star raids will be alone (80:48 - 80:53)
Diglett history and quill fish carvana (80:50 - 80:55)
Feebas sandygas uh three star raids will (80:53 - 80:57)
be Blastoise which apparently can be (80:55 - 80:58)
shiny Gyarados can be shiny maybe they (80:57 - 81:00)
fix this are they fixing this or Genuine (80:58 - 81:02)
Pokemon can be now shiny and no which (81:00 - 81:04)
ones are megas yeah those can Mega (81:02 - 81:06)
uh so never mind (81:04 - 81:09)
uh Lapras wearing a scarf alola mola (81:06 - 81:13)
uh Asia Pacific will be Uxie uh Europe (81:09 - 81:15)
Middle East Africa India Mesprit five (81:13 - 81:17)
stars in America and Greenland as elf (81:15 - 81:19)
Mega rates are Swampert those are active (81:17 - 81:21)
right now (81:19 - 81:22)
so I'll pray (81:21 - 81:24)
they have released a Sandy gas hat a (81:22 - 81:28)
diver outfit and diver goggles in the (81:24 - 81:31)
store they did update this the Avatar (81:28 - 81:34)
stuff it is much better uh the bar was (81:31 - 81:36)
on the floor though so do they have (81:34 - 81:38)
socks (81:36 - 81:40)
uh there are socks now yeah I think they (81:38 - 81:41)
added socks like a year or two ago yeah (81:40 - 81:44)
there have been some it's better I (81:41 - 81:46)
am looking forward to seeing what they (81:44 - 81:48)
do with more Avatar customization (81:46 - 81:50)
potentially in the future we will see (81:48 - 81:51)
where it goes from here I think that (81:50 - 81:54)
this update may be preparing for that (81:51 - 81:57)
we we can only hope (81:54 - 81:59)
I've definitely given them that feedback (81:57 - 82:01)
time and time again (81:59 - 82:03)
um about how important the Avatar stuff (82:01 - 82:05)
is for people (82:03 - 82:08)
myself included (82:05 - 82:08)
uh they also announced the next (82:08 - 82:12)
Community day which is this upcoming (82:10 - 82:17)
weekend which is axu uh no surprise here (82:12 - 82:18)
um actually will be Saturday June 10th (82:17 - 82:20)
from two to five (82:18 - 82:21)
which (82:20 - 82:24)
I thought like when the summer stuff (82:21 - 82:25)
happens they start moving it earlier in (82:24 - 82:28)
the day because it's not as hot (82:25 - 82:31)
nope no like it's the other way around (82:28 - 82:32)
it's earlier in the day during the (82:31 - 82:35)
winter because it's not as dark (82:32 - 82:37)
oh (82:35 - 82:40)
okay I can't remember if you don't know (82:37 - 82:42)
actually cannot evolve into Haxorus uh (82:40 - 82:43)
they'll get access to Breaking swipe (82:42 - 82:46)
your bonuses are three times for (82:43 - 82:48)
catching two times for catching XP two (82:46 - 82:50)
times catching candy (82:48 - 82:52)
more Excel (82:50 - 82:55)
lower modules lasting three hours uh (82:52 - 82:58)
incense lasting three hours surprise (82:55 - 83:00)
snapshot surprise wonder what it'll be (82:58 - 83:03)
who knows it could be anything at this (83:00 - 83:07)
point really what Pokemon is gonna show (83:03 - 83:09)
up on Axia Community today when you take (83:07 - 83:13)
a snapshot the possibilities are (83:09 - 83:15)
Limitless if by Limitless we mean about (83:13 - 83:17)
900 choices but (83:15 - 83:21)
we want additional special trade (83:17 - 83:24)
isn't the like season bonus one extra (83:21 - 83:28)
trade anyways which is why they keep (83:24 - 83:30)
kind of clarifying one additional on two (83:28 - 83:33)
so this would be three three yeah so (83:30 - 83:35)
three is special trades so all of this (83:33 - 83:37)
season for the next three months you'll (83:35 - 83:38)
be able to do two special trades a day (83:37 - 83:41)
uh let me are you certain about that let (83:38 - 83:42)
me that's something I would want to (83:41 - 83:44)
double check I thought that was in the (83:42 - 83:46)
app right now and then uh trades will be (83:44 - 83:49)
50 less Stardust (83:46 - 83:50)
right we're not lucky friends right now (83:49 - 83:52)
so I know that there is the extra candy (83:50 - 83:54)
and there's the extra XL candy and (83:52 - 83:55)
that's what I've been focusing on (83:54 - 83:58)
because I'm not around enough people to (83:55 - 84:00)
special trade that much every day so (83:58 - 84:02)
current season hidden gems are seasonal (84:00 - 84:04)
Pokemon found in the wild seasonal (84:02 - 84:06)
Pokemon hatching for mags one extra (84:04 - 84:08)
special trade so that's for the next 88 (84:06 - 84:09)
days (84:08 - 84:12)
extra candy when trading guaranteed EXO (84:09 - 84:14)
candy when trading (84:12 - 84:16)
infographic I'm looking at this (84:14 - 84:18)
infographic and it's got none of that I (84:16 - 84:20)
mean you know no one said Niantic was (84:18 - 84:22)
good at infographics (84:20 - 84:24)
they're getting better they are getting (84:22 - 84:26)
better for sure (84:24 - 84:29)
the other thing to note is that a (84:26 - 84:31)
seasonal bonus for the last couple (84:29 - 84:34)
seasons were (84:31 - 84:36)
increased raid damage when remoting in (84:34 - 84:39)
they have removed that and now when you (84:36 - 84:43)
remote in your damage is normal it is no (84:39 - 84:46)
longer a bonus it is permanent (84:43 - 84:48)
um that's not quite what happened I (84:46 - 84:49)
think (84:48 - 84:53)
they did remove the bonus being so it (84:49 - 84:55)
was increased (84:53 - 84:58)
from what it was in going to end up (84:55 - 85:01)
being their plan was to have your damage (84:58 - 85:04)
as you were remoting in be lower than if (85:01 - 85:05)
you were in person (85:04 - 85:07)
and they have (85:05 - 85:10)
scrapped that plan basically (85:07 - 85:13)
so when you remote in you will do (85:10 - 85:14)
normal damage which has always been (85:13 - 85:17)
normal damage yeah yeah (85:14 - 85:17)
supposed to be less than Niantic just (85:22 - 85:26)
decided after 14 million Seasons to (85:24 - 85:29)
scrap that so (85:26 - 85:32)
um that's a small win in the grand (85:29 - 85:37)
scheme of remote rated raids I suppose (85:32 - 85:37)
um (85:38 - 85:42)
and they'll still have the like if you (85:39 - 85:45)
missed Community day and you do a raid (85:42 - 85:48)
at a gym which would be fracture it'll (85:45 - 85:50)
make more acts you spawn and stuff (85:48 - 85:52)
that I'm sure some people are taking (85:50 - 85:55)
advantage of that yeah I'm gonna I'm (85:52 - 85:56)
gonna tell you now (85:55 - 85:59)
I'm gonna be late because this is also (85:56 - 86:01)
grad season and my two nephews grad (85:59 - 86:03)
party are that day (86:01 - 86:07)
how dare Niantic planets they should (86:03 - 86:12)
I put it on their calendar Janine (86:07 - 86:12)
um (86:13 - 86:17)
I'm gonna guess that go Fest this year (86:14 - 86:20)
will feature Gumi the next Pokemon in (86:17 - 86:22)
line and they I'm gonna guess that (86:20 - 86:23)
they're gonna turn Gumi shiny and (86:22 - 86:25)
they're gonna put Goomy in one star (86:23 - 86:26)
raids and people are going to run out (86:25 - 86:30)
and do as many goomies as possible and (86:26 - 86:31)
then they're gonna announce Goomy (86:30 - 86:34)
Community Day June of 2024 and then (86:31 - 86:36)
people are gonna complain that their (86:34 - 86:38)
Gumi is no longer a rare or special (86:36 - 86:41)
they've only done this for what three (86:38 - 86:44)
years in a row now people are starting (86:41 - 86:46)
to get used to it (86:44 - 86:48)
Umi is a good shiny too look but for (86:46 - 86:51)
that year you were the king (86:48 - 86:55)
that's true yeah when you put that you (86:51 - 86:57)
had a shiny Axew on your LinkedIn (86:55 - 86:59)
profile you were getting all the job (86:57 - 87:02)
offers all of them that's that is my (86:59 - 87:04)
current strategy I list all of the (87:02 - 87:06)
shinies that I have but now that (87:04 - 87:09)
actually will be out and worthless took (87:06 - 87:11)
it off yeah you got to take it off it's (87:09 - 87:13)
just insulting I still have though (87:11 - 87:16)
Google Certified Pokemon master that (87:13 - 87:19)
that opens many many doors (87:16 - 87:21)
so so far (87:19 - 87:23)
this season's off to a great start (87:21 - 87:25)
everything seems really good not (87:23 - 87:27)
everything (87:25 - 87:29)
okay (87:27 - 87:33)
there's one thing the raid day I think (87:29 - 87:35)
the raid event for oxym (87:33 - 87:39)
is not a great idea following the remote (87:35 - 87:41)
raid changes because those three Pokemon (87:39 - 87:45)
are still locked regionally yeah and so (87:41 - 87:47)
because the laser came remote right into (87:45 - 87:50)
a nuxie you can but only five times and (87:47 - 87:52)
they can be shiny this time (87:50 - 87:58)
so that's that's uh maybe not (87:52 - 88:00)
great yeah (87:58 - 88:03)
it's it's not pleasant just give Niantic (88:00 - 88:05)
your money do it five times a day every (88:03 - 88:06)
single day (88:05 - 88:08)
you're uh (88:06 - 88:10)
sunk cost fallacy you'll eventually get (88:08 - 88:12)
the shiny (88:10 - 88:14)
if I was running it I wouldn't have (88:12 - 88:16)
included that or I would I would them (88:14 - 88:19)
not locked (88:16 - 88:19)
I mean they're trying to make Chinese (88:20 - 88:24)
more rare again at least legendary too (88:21 - 88:27)
late and yep (88:24 - 88:29)
we're gonna put that in a hot hat make (88:27 - 88:33)
Chinese rare again no no no I'm out (88:29 - 88:35)
quitting I quit everything what color (88:33 - 88:37)
what color we can't do red Red's already (88:35 - 88:40)
taken gold yellow yeah gold has to be (88:37 - 88:42)
gold (88:40 - 88:46)
I'll get it up on the story SMP and then (88:42 - 88:47)
what you do is you sell two versions you (88:46 - 88:50)
make one with stars and one with squares (88:47 - 88:52)
one or the other group that one is more (88:50 - 88:55)
rare than the other I love this it's a (88:52 - 88:57)
whole marketing thing we got going now (88:55 - 88:59)
and uh well you're coming on here with (88:57 - 89:02)
200 IQ ideals (88:59 - 89:05)
look the fewer morals we have the more (89:02 - 89:08)
money we'll make perfect (89:05 - 89:10)
hey uh speaking of morals let's talk (89:08 - 89:13)
about this Niantic interview (89:10 - 89:13)
um so uh I tried (89:13 - 89:20)
I could not get through it I tried (89:16 - 89:24)
but so uh Michael the game director is (89:20 - 89:27)
that his official title yep (89:24 - 89:29)
so pretty much the dude (89:27 - 89:32)
in charge of most of Pokemon go that (89:29 - 89:35)
isn't probably constantly wearing a suit (89:32 - 89:38)
uh those people would be above Michael (89:35 - 89:40)
I don't know if anyone in that area is (89:38 - 89:42)
going to be wearing a suit constantly (89:40 - 89:44)
honestly probably jeans and a t-shirts (89:42 - 89:45)
more there (89:44 - 89:47)
go to no you always you always have like (89:45 - 89:49)
the corporate structure of like the (89:47 - 89:51)
chill game director and then all the (89:49 - 89:53)
suits above but then you have the CEO (89:51 - 89:55)
AKA John Henke that goes back to regular (89:53 - 89:58)
clothes but you have this like middle (89:55 - 89:59)
area where it's like (89:58 - 90:04)
anyways awesome so stress code policy (89:59 - 90:06)
like there need to be a lot more books (90:04 - 90:09)
written about how Wild that whole thing (90:06 - 90:11)
is (90:09 - 90:11)
um so Michael went down to Australia to (90:13 - 90:21)
one participate in Mewtwo raid hour (90:17 - 90:23)
Shadow Mewtwo radar where I should (90:21 - 90:25)
clarify because Australia is the second (90:23 - 90:29)
region to get (90:25 - 90:31)
raids (90:29 - 90:32)
um (90:31 - 90:34)
New Zealand being the first obviously (90:32 - 90:36)
and then Michael also went down to meet (90:34 - 90:40)
up with Zoe two dots who is a content (90:36 - 90:42)
creator in Pokemon go who I guess you (90:40 - 90:44)
could say has a slight Advantage as a (90:42 - 90:46)
very big content creator in Australia to (90:44 - 90:48)
get these events first to then post (90:46 - 90:49)
about the events before they roll out to (90:48 - 90:51)
America which is good because then (90:49 - 90:54)
people who watch Zoe can Americans that (90:51 - 90:55)
watch Zoe can be like oh this event is (90:54 - 90:57)
worth it or not worth it (90:55 - 91:00)
um actually honestly because of Zoe's (90:57 - 91:02)
video being like hey this event was (91:00 - 91:05)
really good that put the gold thing on (91:02 - 91:06)
my radar of like oh I should make time (91:05 - 91:08)
on Saturday to do this because Zoe said (91:06 - 91:12)
it was good and I trust always opinion (91:08 - 91:12)
um (91:12 - 91:16)
I think I have no inside information I (91:14 - 91:19)
promise you I also think that maybe (91:16 - 91:22)
Michael went down there to scout out an (91:19 - 91:25)
area for a potential Australian event (91:22 - 91:28)
he was only there for 48 hours that's (91:25 - 91:32)
true stats a lot of time (91:28 - 91:33)
but if they already had an event in mind (91:32 - 91:36)
like a location (91:33 - 91:40)
and I think Zoe's in a pretty big is she (91:36 - 91:43)
not in Sydney I think yeah (91:40 - 91:44)
it would either be in Sydney or it would (91:43 - 91:46)
be in what's what's the other Bagels (91:44 - 91:48)
there's only two Australian cities that (91:46 - 91:50)
would possibly be in Sydney and whatever (91:48 - 91:52)
the other one is the one by Perth but (91:50 - 91:54)
not Perth (91:52 - 91:57)
can't remember what that is right now (91:54 - 91:58)
um (91:57 - 92:00)
there they (91:58 - 92:03)
seven years there is no way that (92:00 - 92:04)
Australia (92:03 - 92:06)
will continue not getting events right (92:04 - 92:08)
like they have to eventually pull the (92:06 - 92:10)
trigger um like (92:08 - 92:11)
that that (92:10 - 92:15)
Oceanic area right like we we get a (92:11 - 92:16)
national (92:15 - 92:19)
we get an Nai not an NAIC and oh (92:16 - 92:22)
whatever the the the VGC structure is (92:19 - 92:25)
down there hmm (92:22 - 92:28)
uh because the euic is Europe and AIC I (92:25 - 92:30)
think it's it's just AIC (92:28 - 92:32)
yeah maybe (92:30 - 92:36)
is it OMC for Oceanic Oceanic it is it (92:32 - 92:38)
is a little weird to be like here's your (92:36 - 92:40)
whole business expense to go down here (92:38 - 92:42)
to play Pokemon I mean he's the director (92:40 - 92:45)
you can do whatever he wants but (92:42 - 92:46)
um (92:45 - 92:48)
I mean end the interview (92:46 - 92:50)
and the interview the interview testing (92:48 - 92:53)
out Shadow me too raids (92:50 - 92:54)
getting to be part of the community (92:53 - 92:57)
which does have value in itself like for (92:54 - 92:59)
sure any game director or any manager (92:57 - 93:02)
that wants to play in a new area this (92:59 - 93:03)
was a thing too (93:02 - 93:05)
um I mean right when the (93:03 - 93:08)
right when the pandemic lifted Niantic (93:05 - 93:11)
was asking us as content creators to go (93:08 - 93:14)
down to areas where they were featuring (93:11 - 93:17)
that's why I went down to a St Louis (93:14 - 93:18)
Community Day (93:17 - 93:20)
the one that got rained out (93:18 - 93:22)
uh because there were supposed to be (93:20 - 93:23)
Niantic employees there and the whole (93:22 - 93:26)
point of that was Niantic employees and (93:23 - 93:28)
content creators playing with a (93:26 - 93:29)
community (93:28 - 93:31)
so they could get more feedback that's (93:29 - 93:34)
where I met like the the lady who made (93:31 - 93:36)
the mega stuff we talked about that on (93:34 - 93:37)
the show and that was like really really (93:36 - 93:39)
cool that was I did not go I did not (93:37 - 93:40)
know she was going to be there I just (93:39 - 93:42)
went like okay like I'll go to St Louis (93:40 - 93:45)
I unfortunately it rained out that that (93:42 - 93:48)
weekend but (93:45 - 93:50)
so Zoe posted an hour and a half (93:48 - 93:54)
interview in her interview with Michael (93:50 - 93:57)
and uh she got questions from Twitter (93:54 - 93:59)
she had her own questions (93:57 - 94:02)
um lesson that I've picked up is that if (93:59 - 94:04)
you see a content creator who has a good (94:02 - 94:06)
relationship with Niantic posting the (94:04 - 94:09)
question if you could ask Niantic one (94:06 - 94:10)
question what would it be (94:09 - 94:12)
there's going to be an interview because (94:10 - 94:14)
this is the exact same question as last (94:12 - 94:15)
time (94:14 - 94:17)
who did it last time that was Nick (94:15 - 94:18)
though wasn't it Nick interviewed (94:17 - 94:22)
Kestrel Kestrel yes and (94:18 - 94:24)
they are the community (94:22 - 94:27)
manager not game director so they're in (94:24 - 94:30)
charge of overseeing (94:27 - 94:30)
ahead of community development for (94:32 - 94:36)
Pokemon go (94:34 - 94:38)
it went back and re-watched that kind of (94:36 - 94:41)
alongside this interview kind of seeing (94:38 - 94:42)
the differences and where things have (94:41 - 94:44)
gone between the two (94:42 - 94:48)
yeah kestrel's great uh (94:44 - 94:51)
so I have all the questions here (94:48 - 94:53)
um (94:51 - 94:54)
I don't know if we need to go through (94:53 - 94:57)
all of them uh if we'll start with (94:54 - 94:59)
Hannah though what do you want to talk (94:57 - 95:01)
about first what question slash answer (94:59 - 95:03)
was (95:01 - 95:03)
um there's so much I couldn't make it (95:04 - 95:08)
through this interview (95:06 - 95:08)
to have sat through so many Town Halls (95:09 - 95:15)
from corporate people who (95:11 - 95:15)
tell their version of the truth (95:18 - 95:25)
uh and it is always very (95:21 - 95:26)
much (95:25 - 95:28)
an answer to not the question that's (95:26 - 95:30)
being asked (95:28 - 95:32)
um that like within the first few (95:30 - 95:34)
minutes I'm like I I I'm out I cannot do (95:32 - 95:37)
another one of these because again this (95:34 - 95:39)
isn't this is (95:37 - 95:41)
honest (95:39 - 95:45)
it just it I I didn't want to spend an (95:41 - 95:47)
hour and a half of my time I mean that's (95:45 - 95:50)
screaming at the at the at the screen (95:47 - 95:52)
I've done that for most of my career (95:50 - 95:54)
and I guess the way I'm going at it as (95:52 - 95:56)
someone who is younger and much more (95:54 - 95:58)
naive with this sort of thing is I'm (95:56 - 96:00)
picking this up as this is where we go (95:58 - 96:02)
from here this is what they are set on (96:00 - 96:05)
we need to work with this we need to (96:02 - 96:08)
figure out where we go from here off of (96:05 - 96:09)
what they are saying now (96:08 - 96:12)
and I think that the main thing I saw in (96:09 - 96:15)
the way people were reacting (96:12 - 96:16)
oh (96:15 - 96:19)
so I was trying to look (96:16 - 96:22)
before Hannah starts can I just say (96:19 - 96:25)
nothing in this interview surprised me (96:22 - 96:27)
and if you are listening to this show (96:25 - 96:32)
and listening to what Greg will Hannah (96:27 - 96:35)
myself have been saying all of the (96:32 - 96:37)
answers are exactly what we have been (96:35 - 96:40)
saying yeah they're they're exactly (96:37 - 96:43)
what we expect them to be like there was (96:40 - 96:45)
there was a point I'm sorry Hannah I (96:43 - 96:47)
didn't mean no you're good there was a (96:45 - 96:48)
point where (96:47 - 96:52)
Michael says we want our game to be (96:48 - 96:54)
different there are so many games you (96:52 - 96:57)
can play on your couch we want you to go (96:54 - 97:00)
outside which is a hundred percent the (96:57 - 97:03)
answer I expected Michael to give to (97:00 - 97:05)
differentiate his game because that's (97:03 - 97:07)
what we've been saying at the show for (97:05 - 97:11)
like seven years that is for whether or (97:07 - 97:14)
not you like it that does make their (97:11 - 97:17)
game unique right the the issue that (97:14 - 97:18)
I've had with that answer and the issue (97:17 - 97:22)
that I have even here is (97:18 - 97:25)
there is not (97:22 - 97:28)
a company that exists that doesn't want (97:25 - 97:30)
to go after every Market they can get to (97:28 - 97:35)
right so when a company says we want to (97:30 - 97:37)
differentiate ourselves (97:35 - 97:40)
what's being hidden under there is we're (97:37 - 97:44)
being told that we can't compete so (97:40 - 97:47)
there's no way when (97:44 - 97:50)
everybody's on their phone and every app (97:47 - 97:51)
is fighting for your time sitting on (97:50 - 97:54)
your couch that Pokemon go is also not (97:51 - 97:57)
going after that market if they were (97:54 - 97:59)
allowed to do so I mean they're keeping (97:57 - 98:00)
PVP (97:59 - 98:02)
right just saying that that's still kind (98:00 - 98:05)
of an on your camera thing so when they (98:02 - 98:08)
say we want to differentiate what we can (98:05 - 98:10)
look at behind is the carpet speak of (98:08 - 98:12)
they didn't get the crossover they (98:10 - 98:15)
wanted for let's go Evie it didn't go (98:12 - 98:18)
the way they had planned they are being (98:15 - 98:21)
informed to take their product in a (98:18 - 98:23)
different direction and focus on the (98:21 - 98:25)
thing that they can do because they're (98:23 - 98:28)
again there isn't a company in the world (98:25 - 98:31)
that doesn't want to go after every (98:28 - 98:34)
customer and every aspect they can get (98:31 - 98:37)
and when that's infringing on somebody (98:34 - 98:39)
else in the same company they're going (98:37 - 98:41)
to be told you need to stop (98:39 - 98:44)
it is pulling funds away or it's (98:41 - 98:47)
creating brand confusion or it whatever (98:44 - 98:49)
reason they were given so when they say (98:47 - 98:52)
we want to differentiate understand that (98:49 - 98:53)
they were told that they need to (98:52 - 98:55)
differentiate by the Pokemon company by (98:53 - 98:57)
the Pokemon company they but the Pokemon (98:55 - 98:59)
company wants you to buy scarlet and (98:57 - 99:01)
violet and sit on your inside on your (98:59 - 99:03)
couch and play those games and when when (99:01 - 99:04)
you're outside they want you to play (99:03 - 99:07)
another Pokemon game right (99:04 - 99:11)
um and some of I mean Pokemon go has (99:07 - 99:13)
been focused on going out and exploring (99:11 - 99:15)
the whole time we can say that we know (99:13 - 99:18)
that and I (99:15 - 99:20)
think that this is nuanced I don't think (99:18 - 99:23)
it's wrong for the core attendance of (99:20 - 99:25)
the game to be Community exploration and (99:23 - 99:28)
exercise but I do think that that's a (99:25 - 99:30)
hard thing to make Equitable in a large (99:28 - 99:32)
scale game where players can trade (99:30 - 99:36)
Pokemon and compete directly (99:32 - 99:40)
uh that said that said I do think it is (99:36 - 99:42)
possible for Niantic to make the game (99:40 - 99:44)
more Equitable than it is right now I (99:42 - 99:46)
also think like I said earlier today (99:44 - 99:48)
that they need to think more out of the (99:46 - 99:50)
box than just raids (99:48 - 99:53)
yeah I I think the focus on the (99:50 - 99:56)
exploration and all of that (99:53 - 99:59)
was there sort of from the beginning but (99:56 - 100:02)
I think uh (99:59 - 100:06)
it was a this is what we want you to do (100:02 - 100:08)
this is you know we kind of want you to (100:06 - 100:09)
explore and then (100:08 - 100:13)
really all of that was a nice to have (100:09 - 100:15)
and proved it was a nice to have during (100:13 - 100:17)
the covid well we're still in covid but (100:15 - 100:23)
during the severe lockdowns and honestly (100:17 - 100:26)
the renewed focus on that (100:23 - 100:28)
it it's easy to say and they can point (100:26 - 100:30)
to that saying this is what we wanted (100:28 - 100:32)
from all all along but your product (100:30 - 100:35)
proves and has been proven that it's not (100:32 - 100:39)
vital to your game for those tenants to (100:35 - 100:41)
be followed and that there is an (100:39 - 100:44)
external reason that you're heavily (100:41 - 100:46)
enforcing it now and you're heavily (100:44 - 100:48)
enforcing in a way that does hurt (100:46 - 100:50)
members of your community that found a (100:48 - 100:52)
lot of value in your game and they still (100:50 - 100:54)
have never come up with a great answer (100:52 - 100:57)
to that (100:54 - 100:57)
and a lot of people didn't maybe you're (100:59 - 101:04)
thinking of a different place than I am (101:02 - 101:06)
Steve a lot of people I think didn't (101:04 - 101:09)
pick up on one sentence that was said in (101:06 - 101:12)
the interview where (101:09 - 101:14)
Michael said that they are currently (101:12 - 101:16)
working on additional solutions for (101:14 - 101:18)
players that were negatively impacted by (101:16 - 101:21)
the remote rate changes the amount of (101:18 - 101:25)
times a company says that with nothing (101:21 - 101:27)
to show for it (101:25 - 101:30)
it is a way to get people to say Well (101:27 - 101:31)
they're working on something it's a way (101:30 - 101:33)
to shut up distractors I'm sorry when (101:31 - 101:35)
you don't have solid Solutions and you (101:33 - 101:37)
say we're working on it they have been (101:35 - 101:40)
working on things now for four years and (101:37 - 101:43)
you have nothing to show for it it is an (101:40 - 101:47)
empty corporate statement (101:43 - 101:50)
that's like that's like Steve saying (101:47 - 101:52)
we're working on will getting back on (101:50 - 101:54)
the show (101:52 - 101:54)
you said that he'd be willing to come (101:57 - 102:01)
back on yeah but (101:59 - 102:04)
it is not a he's not coming back for (102:01 - 102:08)
like that is a way of saying if he shows (102:04 - 102:10)
up once we fulfilled that promise like (102:08 - 102:12)
it is a hollow (102:10 - 102:14)
statement and it's frustrating when they (102:12 - 102:17)
can when they say those things and don't (102:14 - 102:19)
actually point to anything so because (102:17 - 102:21)
Greg do you think this game should just (102:19 - 102:23)
be about raids (102:21 - 102:26)
then because that's kind of what I'm I'm (102:23 - 102:28)
hearing you say that the the player base (102:26 - 102:30)
wants this game to just be raids and I (102:28 - 102:32)
don't think this game is Just trades I (102:30 - 102:34)
don't think that this game should just (102:32 - 102:38)
be raids but I do think that (102:34 - 102:40)
they need to look at like making (102:38 - 102:44)
Community Day spawns we happened again (102:40 - 102:46)
for people that can't go out into Open (102:44 - 102:48)
Spaces or into closed spaces or the way (102:46 - 102:50)
they run now I I do think they still (102:48 - 102:52)
need to resolve the fact that if you (102:50 - 102:54)
have a get up and go and explore the (102:52 - 102:55)
fact that (102:54 - 102:58)
you use cell phone traffic to drive (102:55 - 103:00)
spawn rates so if you're in the middle (102:58 - 103:02)
of nowhere your spawns are next to (103:00 - 103:04)
nothing and you don't have a resolution (103:02 - 103:06)
for that like it's it's much deeper than (103:04 - 103:10)
just rating it is the fact that you that (103:06 - 103:12)
I am in the middle of a downtown area (103:10 - 103:14)
which is still (103:12 - 103:17)
anthetical to to how Pokemon is supposed (103:14 - 103:19)
to be which is out in the wild when I'm (103:17 - 103:22)
out in the wild nothing shows up (103:19 - 103:25)
and you've never resolved that when I (103:22 - 103:28)
walk more like you do a 15-minute daily (103:25 - 103:31)
incense which is cool for 15 minutes but (103:28 - 103:33)
it still doesn't sort of resolve the a (103:31 - 103:37)
lot of those issues around how your game (103:33 - 103:41)
supports all people equally it's it's (103:37 - 103:44)
much farther than Beyond a raid it's the (103:41 - 103:47)
fact that if I don't have stops near me (103:44 - 103:49)
I have to purchase pokeballs like there (103:47 - 103:54)
are taxes on people who don't have busy (103:49 - 103:57)
streets busy cities and busy places I (103:54 - 103:59)
mean Michael talked about that which was (103:57 - 104:01)
pretty much (103:59 - 104:03)
we can't make a game for everyone right (104:01 - 104:06)
that is that is a corporate answer like (104:03 - 104:08)
that is the answer of them saying (104:06 - 104:13)
We're Not Really Gonna fix these issues (104:08 - 104:15)
I mean you just suggested some fixes (104:13 - 104:18)
there are possible fixes there are ways (104:15 - 104:20)
to make this game more Equitable there (104:18 - 104:22)
are (104:20 - 104:24)
I mean it's like impossible is that I'm (104:22 - 104:26)
saying that we can come up with it I'm (104:24 - 104:28)
saying that I don't think they are (104:26 - 104:29)
invested in that (104:28 - 104:31)
like I think that there are people at (104:29 - 104:34)
Niantic especially after having gone and (104:31 - 104:37)
re-listened to kestrel's interview with (104:34 - 104:40)
Nick from last year or however long ago (104:37 - 104:41)
that was (104:40 - 104:44)
um I think there are people at Niantic (104:41 - 104:47)
who do really care oh there are I (104:44 - 104:49)
guarantee it there are in a million (104:47 - 104:50)
places (104:49 - 104:52)
there are a ton of people that really (104:50 - 104:54)
care that are lower employees is it's (104:52 - 104:56)
getting the upper people who make the (104:54 - 104:58)
decisions who do the budgets to also (104:56 - 105:01)
care and I don't know that necessarily (104:58 - 105:03)
exists and again we're talking about the (105:01 - 105:05)
fact that we have (105:03 - 105:07)
we're seeing it in a lot of other (105:05 - 105:10)
aspects of Pokemon we have a very locked (105:07 - 105:14)
down communication style and approval (105:10 - 105:17)
style at the Pokemon company like we (105:14 - 105:20)
have a lock at the stop at this at the (105:17 - 105:22)
very top that I don't see breaking (105:20 - 105:24)
anytime soon (105:22 - 105:26)
uh yeah I mean like this goes back to (105:24 - 105:28)
people being like the Pokemon company (105:26 - 105:29)
should take the game away from niant (105:28 - 105:31)
they can give it to somebody else like (105:29 - 105:33)
one name one other company that's like (105:31 - 105:35)
doing nothing that's like we would love (105:33 - 105:38)
to work like like (105:35 - 105:39)
I mean this is if your video game (105:38 - 105:41)
company isn't actively making a game or (105:39 - 105:43)
doesn't have a deal uh you're probably (105:41 - 105:44)
out of business I mean this is the (105:43 - 105:48)
direwolf TCG problem (105:44 - 105:50)
yeah they took it away from direwolf and (105:48 - 105:53)
they've made a worse product like and I (105:50 - 105:55)
wish I could they didn't give direwolf (105:53 - 105:57)
the money they needed they took it away (105:55 - 105:58)
to make something else they are putting (105:57 - 106:03)
the money in there either it's it's this (105:58 - 106:03)
they are growing at a rate that I don't (106:03 - 106:09)
think they can keep on top of what they (106:06 - 106:11)
want there on top of what Their audience (106:09 - 106:13)
needs (106:11 - 106:15)
I think as much as I hate saying this (106:13 - 106:18)
Niantic is the right company (106:15 - 106:21)
right now to be managing and making (106:18 - 106:23)
Pokemon Go I mean the whole game is (106:21 - 106:26)
built on their own internal system you (106:23 - 106:27)
can't you can't separate Pokemon go and (106:26 - 106:30)
Niantic right I mean they did with the (106:27 - 106:32)
TCG I (106:30 - 106:34)
like they rebuilt the whole thing from (106:32 - 106:36)
scratch from direwolf digital I don't (106:34 - 106:38)
know if it's the same thing I feel like (106:36 - 106:40)
Niantic probably has some sort of thing (106:38 - 106:42)
trademarked with that type of game yeah (106:40 - 106:45)
maybe but like even you know again if if (106:42 - 106:47)
somebody else is running it does that (106:45 - 106:50)
mean like the game suddenly gets better (106:47 - 106:52)
no because I think the the issues with (106:50 - 106:56)
Pokemon go are at a more like if if you (106:52 - 106:58)
I don't know I always use if you live in (106:56 - 107:01)
like Appleton Wisconsin and you're like (106:58 - 107:03)
Community Days suck here and there's not (107:01 - 107:06)
enough spawns well yes you're in (107:03 - 107:07)
Appleton Wisconsin that's your first (107:06 - 107:09)
problem number two is like could you (107:07 - 107:13)
drive the the three hours till Milwaukee (107:09 - 107:15)
and have a much better experience a (107:13 - 107:17)
hundred percent if you drive an extra (107:15 - 107:20)
hour to Chicago because Chicago is an (107:17 - 107:22)
hour south of Milwaukee you will have an (107:20 - 107:25)
even better experience Milwaukee is the (107:22 - 107:27)
26th biggest city in the United States (107:25 - 107:29)
it's huge Chicago is what like the (107:27 - 107:30)
eighth biggest city in the United States (107:29 - 107:33)
it's huge like like there's such a huge (107:30 - 107:34)
difference between Milwaukee and Chicago (107:33 - 107:37)
when it comes to like spawns and and (107:34 - 107:39)
gyms and pokestops (107:37 - 107:41)
and and people playing right (107:39 - 107:44)
um but like (107:41 - 107:46)
Appleton Wisconsin isn't even like that (107:44 - 107:48)
small of a city (107:46 - 107:52)
and they have their own problems and (107:48 - 107:54)
for night even I don't know how many (107:52 - 107:56)
people work at Niantic even for a (107:54 - 107:58)
thousand people to be working at Niantic (107:56 - 108:01)
to like try to individually improve (107:58 - 108:04)
every single Town Village City it's just (108:01 - 108:06)
it's in literally an impossible task (108:04 - 108:10)
yeah without having Community people go (108:06 - 108:13)
on and submit pokestops and uh for (108:10 - 108:15)
what's that called Wayfair and then (108:13 - 108:17)
having other people approve the (108:15 - 108:20)
pokestops like I've done Wayfair I know (108:17 - 108:23)
some people like doing the Wayfair thing (108:20 - 108:25)
um I worked on the Apple map team when (108:23 - 108:27)
Apple Maps launched let me tell you a (108:25 - 108:29)
story I was working at Apple when Apple (108:27 - 108:32)
Maps launched it was so bad and apple (108:29 - 108:35)
pulled a bunch of people and was like we (108:32 - 108:38)
need to make Apple Maps better and so we (108:35 - 108:40)
have all of these Community reports from (108:38 - 108:41)
people being like this turn doesn't (108:40 - 108:43)
exist this street is actually closed (108:41 - 108:45)
this on-ramp should be like three (108:43 - 108:48)
streets down and what Apple had us do (108:45 - 108:53)
was pull up Google Maps and compare (108:48 - 108:56)
to then update Apple Maps to make it (108:53 - 108:59)
better and like maybe that's why I don't (108:56 - 109:01)
like Wayfair because I sat on that (108:59 - 109:04)
project for like three months and I was (109:01 - 109:08)
like this is so there's it's not fun (109:04 - 109:09)
like (109:08 - 109:11)
I and and it was it was weird too (109:09 - 109:13)
because like I started doing like (109:11 - 109:15)
Milwaukee and I was like okay I've done (109:13 - 109:18)
this done here yep okay fix this oh I've (109:15 - 109:19)
never been to this part of Milwaukee I (109:18 - 109:21)
don't actually know where this on-ramp (109:19 - 109:23)
should be I don't know if this is right (109:21 - 109:24)
or not like this is like 10 minutes from (109:23 - 109:26)
my house but I've never been down this (109:24 - 109:28)
road (109:26 - 109:30)
and like I can't do anywhere else like I (109:28 - 109:34)
can't I can't Wayfarer Austin Texas (109:30 - 109:36)
because I don't actually know if that's (109:34 - 109:37)
there or not like I've never been there (109:36 - 109:40)
so like it goes back to (109:37 - 109:43)
like I can I can Wayfair some of (109:40 - 109:45)
Minneapolis because I've been here for a (109:43 - 109:50)
year but like I I I I don't know if that (109:45 - 109:53)
like playground still exists like every (109:50 - 109:55)
time I did Wayfarer it was giving me (109:53 - 109:57)
places I'd never been before and the (109:55 - 109:59)
whole context you had the whole context (109:57 - 110:00)
you had were just the photos that the (109:59 - 110:03)
player took to submit the pokestop and (110:00 - 110:07)
Google Maps or Google Earth view of the (110:03 - 110:08)
location and you just kind of had to (110:07 - 110:10)
figure it out from there I don't think I (110:08 - 110:11)
ever saw a place that I actually (110:10 - 110:13)
recognized Wayfair is supposed to give (110:11 - 110:16)
you places to you like so if there's no (110:13 - 110:18)
places to you then it starts branching (110:16 - 110:21)
more and more out that's but anyways (110:18 - 110:23)
that's like that's what they mentioned (110:21 - 110:25)
where they they can't control the whole (110:23 - 110:26)
game map that's one of the hardest (110:25 - 110:29)
things with this game right right that's (110:26 - 110:31)
why I'm saying like Niantic has slightly (110:29 - 110:34)
improved the spawns they have said they (110:31 - 110:35)
increased the spawns and they did during (110:34 - 110:36)
covet and they didn't revert those back (110:35 - 110:39)
so there are more spawns in more places (110:36 - 110:42)
um and there are more pokestops and more (110:39 - 110:45)
gyms in more places but like (110:42 - 110:48)
if this game lasts another seven years (110:45 - 110:49)
these These are still going to be the (110:48 - 110:51)
same problems because the world is too (110:49 - 110:53)
big like there's not there's there that (110:51 - 110:56)
we you would literally need (110:53 - 110:59)
you could add another a thousand Niantic (110:56 - 111:02)
employees to like add more stuff in the (110:59 - 111:03)
world but it goes back to the same (111:02 - 111:05)
problem as the Apple Maps thing (111:03 - 111:07)
I've never been there I don't know if (111:05 - 111:10)
that exists or not like I have no clue (111:07 - 111:12)
in my own City that I've lived in for 20 (111:10 - 111:15)
some years if this street connects to (111:12 - 111:17)
this street because I just never drive (111:15 - 111:20)
over there I just don't have to go in (111:17 - 111:22)
that direction ever (111:20 - 111:23)
um (111:22 - 111:27)
so like this problem is like when I kind (111:23 - 111:28)
of like (111:27 - 111:31)
I don't want to say it's unsolvable sure (111:28 - 111:34)
these inter or this interview all of the (111:31 - 111:37)
feedback I've been looking at it a lot (111:34 - 111:39)
and thinking about it a lot and have (111:37 - 111:43)
come up with some just my brain is just (111:39 - 111:45)
keeps coming up with ideas that maybe (111:43 - 111:47)
this could be better maybe this could be (111:45 - 111:48)
more Equitable maybe that they could (111:47 - 111:52)
take the density of the spawns and stops (111:48 - 111:54)
in your area and customize the Pokemon (111:52 - 111:56)
you see based off of that player by (111:54 - 111:59)
player maybe they could take your (111:56 - 112:02)
average kilometers walked and customize (111:59 - 112:04)
the amount of Pokemon you can run into (112:02 - 112:06)
player by player and that that would (112:04 - 112:07)
potentially make it more Equitable both (112:06 - 112:09)
for players who aren't able to move as (112:07 - 112:11)
much for one reason or another or for (112:09 - 112:14)
players who are in a rural location I (112:11 - 112:16)
think that there are potential solutions (112:14 - 112:19)
to some of these things (112:16 - 112:21)
but there was there was a point in the (112:19 - 112:22)
interview (112:21 - 112:24)
where we're they were talking about (112:22 - 112:26)
rural like people in the middle of (112:24 - 112:27)
nowhere right (112:26 - 112:28)
and this is where like (112:27 - 112:31)
Michael answered it pretty honestly (112:28 - 112:33)
where he was like maybe they should play (112:31 - 112:34)
a different game that we have other (112:33 - 112:37)
Pokemon games out there like (112:34 - 112:39)
if you live in the middle of nowhere and (112:37 - 112:41)
you don't have spawns and there's no (112:39 - 112:42)
gyms (112:41 - 112:44)
why don't you get like scarlet and (112:42 - 112:46)
violet like he didn't say like go on (112:44 - 112:48)
Vice girls pilot but like like he pretty (112:46 - 112:50)
much insinuated we have other Pokemon (112:48 - 112:52)
products for people and maybe this isn't (112:50 - 112:55)
the game for you and I'm sure like I am (112:52 - 112:57)
sure a bunch of people got really mad at (112:55 - 113:01)
that answer but like what else (112:57 - 113:04)
like like Niantic can't just randomly (113:01 - 113:06)
teleport to your specific City add five (113:04 - 113:09)
pokestops increase the Pokemon and like (113:06 - 113:12)
sure that fixes your specific city or (113:09 - 113:14)
town or Village but like (113:12 - 113:18)
there's it's there's just so many (113:14 - 113:18)
like it's just it's it's just a such a (113:19 - 113:24)
daunting problem to solve (113:21 - 113:26)
and like yes we're seven years into this (113:24 - 113:28)
game and yes it's gotten better in some (113:26 - 113:30)
aspects like not even like we're not (113:28 - 113:32)
even talking about the remote raids or (113:30 - 113:34)
like the raid system but like as a game (113:32 - 113:37)
with Pokemon spawning and more stops and (113:34 - 113:41)
more gyms it has gotten better (113:37 - 113:42)
um (113:41 - 113:45)
but like (113:42 - 113:47)
I don't know when I was when I was uh in (113:45 - 113:49)
the middle of nowhere past Duluth (113:47 - 113:52)
wherever that where wherever that is and (113:49 - 113:55)
I was there for five days and I opened (113:52 - 113:58)
my phone and the nearest pokestop was (113:55 - 113:58)
like (113:58 - 114:00)
five miles away it was the only one I (113:58 - 114:01)
could see on the map and there was (114:00 - 114:04)
literally no spawns in the cabin I was (114:01 - 114:06)
staying in and I just thought to myself (114:04 - 114:07)
that was the first time ever in like (114:06 - 114:09)
that would have been like two years ago (114:07 - 114:11)
so in five years of playing Pokemon go (114:09 - 114:12)
that was the first time I thought to (114:11 - 114:13)
myself (114:12 - 114:17)
if this is genuinely where I lived which (114:13 - 114:19)
is a lot of people yep (114:17 - 114:22)
I would never play this game yep ever (114:19 - 114:25)
yeah I I would maybe like log in if I (114:22 - 114:26)
went to a big city or maybe if I was (114:25 - 114:28)
traveling on vacation I would maybe log (114:26 - 114:32)
in but like this I uh there's nothing to (114:28 - 114:34)
do yeah and it would have been the same (114:32 - 114:37)
case for Ingress probably yep for this (114:34 - 114:39)
for the first game that Niantic had (114:37 - 114:41)
based on this system (114:39 - 114:41)
like it was it like even even Pikmin (114:42 - 114:48)
I I don't open it like I open it maybe (114:46 - 114:50)
right before I go to bed to like send (114:48 - 114:51)
all my Pikmin out to do mushrooms which (114:50 - 114:53)
is only three things it takes less than (114:51 - 114:55)
60 seconds to do that but like Pikmin is (114:53 - 114:57)
a game that you cannot play at home like (114:55 - 114:59)
at least with Pokemon I could do like (114:57 - 115:00)
some management I can like level up I (114:59 - 115:03)
can do GBL I can maybe remote into a (115:00 - 115:05)
raid but like (115:03 - 115:07)
Pikmin you can't play at home at all you (115:05 - 115:09)
literally have to walk (115:07 - 115:12)
um and like move (115:09 - 115:14)
and if that's not the game for you (115:12 - 115:15)
that's not the game for you (115:14 - 115:19)
Niantic can make it better but like (115:15 - 115:20)
and there are ways that they can (115:19 - 115:23)
incorporate better gameplay for players (115:20 - 115:26)
who can't get out that don't or (115:23 - 115:27)
never mind I'm getting all turned out (115:26 - 115:30)
turned around but there are ways things (115:27 - 115:32)
can improve that aren't raids that's (115:30 - 115:33)
where I really want to go from here (115:32 - 115:34)
there's so much (115:33 - 115:38)
even in that cabin when I open it up and (115:34 - 115:39)
there's no spawns and I was like okay (115:38 - 115:42)
I'll walk that two miles to the pokestop (115:39 - 115:46)
even turning on the 15 minute incense (115:42 - 115:49)
one I no one's walking two miles in 15 (115:46 - 115:50)
minutes (115:49 - 115:54)
and two like at that point why am I even (115:50 - 115:55)
playing the game to get to the point of (115:54 - 115:58)
like turning on the incense like there (115:55 - 116:00)
are other games and like you can't even (115:58 - 116:01)
GBL at that point because you need to (116:00 - 116:04)
catch Pokemon to then power them up to (116:01 - 116:07)
then sit at home to do gbo (116:04 - 116:09)
like there was there I I think we talked (116:07 - 116:10)
about this a month ago that I read on (116:09 - 116:12)
Reddit somebody was like oh I got the (116:10 - 116:15)
Jirachi Quest but like the quest is like (116:12 - 116:18)
spin one pokestop 14 days in a row and (116:15 - 116:19)
they're like my nearest pokestop is 30 (116:18 - 116:22)
minutes away and somebody was like I (116:19 - 116:23)
don't mean to be rude but why are you (116:22 - 116:25)
playing this game then (116:23 - 116:27)
which is like (116:25 - 116:29)
I'm sorry for our audio listeners I made (116:27 - 116:30)
like a shrugging like I don't know what (116:29 - 116:33)
to do face like but yeah like what why (116:30 - 116:35)
are you like I know why you're playing (116:33 - 116:36)
the game because there is like Niantic (116:35 - 116:39)
did make this like addictive core thing (116:36 - 116:41)
when it actually works but like (116:39 - 116:43)
man if you're 30 minutes away from a (116:41 - 116:45)
pokestop like I I don't know how you're (116:43 - 116:47)
playing this game without like remoting (116:45 - 116:49)
raids and like throwing in money or just (116:47 - 116:51)
buying incense or buying Pokeballs and (116:49 - 116:52)
you shouldn't be doing any of that (116:51 - 116:53)
because like (116:52 - 116:55)
if you lived in a city that stuff's all (116:53 - 116:57)
like there for you because you have the (116:55 - 117:02)
privilege yeah it (116:57 - 117:02)
they created (117:02 - 117:06)
something (117:04 - 117:08)
super appealing (117:06 - 117:11)
and super accessible (117:08 - 117:14)
to a lot of people because like it or (117:11 - 117:15)
not (117:14 - 117:18)
cell phones are a huge part of society (117:15 - 117:21)
and they tapped a huge Market that had (117:18 - 117:24)
never been tapped before and I think the (117:21 - 117:27)
biggest frustration that everybody is (117:24 - 117:30)
feeling and I'm sure Niantic is too is (117:27 - 117:34)
they have to carve away the things that (117:30 - 117:37)
don't work to keep their game viable in (117:34 - 117:38)
their (117:37 - 117:42)
vision and we are going to have to deal (117:38 - 117:47)
with the fact that ultimately through (117:42 - 117:50)
whatever reasons and whatever you think (117:47 - 117:53)
the decision has been made at a higher (117:50 - 117:57)
level that this is the game and there's (117:53 - 117:59)
no amount of promising or we're working (117:57 - 118:01)
on it that is going to change that (117:59 - 118:05)
fundamental aspect of this is the game (118:01 - 118:09)
and they have to carve away (118:05 - 118:12)
the things that are not worth it (118:09 - 118:15)
monetarily (118:12 - 118:15)
near the end of the raid Zoe did ask (118:15 - 118:19)
what (118:18 - 118:23)
the biggest regret was or did I say (118:19 - 118:24)
you're at the end of the red near the (118:23 - 118:26)
end of the interview (118:24 - 118:26)
I feel the end of the interview (118:27 - 118:31)
Zoe did ask what the biggest regret that (118:29 - 118:33)
they had was or that Michael had was and (118:31 - 118:36)
it was how they introduced remote raids (118:33 - 118:39)
and how they didn't think about it at (118:36 - 118:41)
the beginning and how he wished they had (118:39 - 118:42)
thought more about how they were (118:41 - 118:44)
introducing them at the beginning and (118:42 - 118:47)
that makes sense I think he said that he (118:44 - 118:48)
kind of wish they started with a limit (118:47 - 118:51)
yeah with the limit maybe at a higher (118:48 - 118:53)
price maybe where they are now and (118:51 - 118:55)
whether whether anything would have been (118:53 - 118:57)
received differently and it was it's (118:55 - 118:58)
still shot and it's completely (118:57 - 119:00)
understandable that they they started (118:58 - 119:03)
out kind of fumbling around because it (119:00 - 119:06)
was a weird time there was a lot going (119:03 - 119:08)
on then but (119:06 - 119:10)
it's still kind of shocking to me that (119:08 - 119:12)
not only did remote raids launch at the (119:10 - 119:14)
same price as a regular raid (119:12 - 119:19)
but they kept it for so long (119:14 - 119:19)
like I I expected the price to go up (119:20 - 119:26)
or the like (119:24 - 119:29)
damage reduction to kick in or the the (119:26 - 119:31)
reduce like you do less damage because (119:29 - 119:32)
you're remoting in I expected those to (119:31 - 119:35)
kick in like six months to a year and (119:32 - 119:37)
they what was it three plus years that (119:35 - 119:39)
both of those stayed at the reduced cost (119:37 - 119:42)
price price went up some yeah I mean I (119:39 - 119:45)
do often feel that (119:42 - 119:48)
a lot of (119:45 - 119:50)
the decisions and this isn't just (119:48 - 119:53)
Niantic but this is across a lot of (119:50 - 119:56)
companies is because (119:53 - 120:00)
you don't have enough diversity on your (119:56 - 120:04)
groups to run these past that you don't (120:00 - 120:06)
have people who can who would actually (120:04 - 120:08)
think of (120:06 - 120:13)
the downstream effects right like you (120:08 - 120:16)
don't if you had any person on there (120:13 - 120:20)
that would have thought about like it (120:16 - 120:22)
was the same thing with the changing of (120:20 - 120:24)
the distances you know that they went (120:22 - 120:28)
back on like if you have people that who (120:24 - 120:32)
are versed in and think about the other (120:28 - 120:34)
aspects of who this is affecting you can (120:32 - 120:37)
get ahead of those things in so many (120:34 - 120:41)
ways an across-the-board corporations (120:37 - 120:41)
invite very specific groups to support (120:41 - 120:47)
their idea and don't tend to invite in (120:44 - 120:50)
the negative (120:47 - 120:52)
aspects the people who would say this is (120:50 - 120:54)
a problem and I say this as a person (120:52 - 120:57)
whose entire career was the person that (120:54 - 121:00)
they called in to meetings to say (120:57 - 121:01)
this is the person that's going to point (121:00 - 121:03)
out all the problems because you're (121:01 - 121:04)
ignoring them (121:03 - 121:08)
and I was often called in very late and (121:04 - 121:09)
I would come in and be like in the first (121:08 - 121:12)
five minutes why are your answers for (121:09 - 121:14)
these seven things that are real (121:12 - 121:18)
and I have shut down in my career many (121:14 - 121:21)
projects because I was finally the (121:18 - 121:23)
person they brought in to say this won't (121:21 - 121:25)
work this won't work this won't work (121:23 - 121:26)
this won't work these are the five (121:25 - 121:28)
things you have to solve or the four (121:26 - 121:30)
things or the three things you need to (121:28 - 121:32)
solve for this to be a success and that (121:30 - 121:34)
just doesn't happen and it's it often (121:32 - 121:36)
feels very clear in a lot of what's (121:34 - 121:39)
Happening Here and then across multiple (121:36 - 121:42)
games they aren't bringing in people who (121:39 - 121:45)
are asking those tough questions and (121:42 - 121:47)
part of the other problem is (121:45 - 121:50)
we are in a great layoff time you are (121:47 - 121:52)
laying off the people who have the (121:50 - 121:55)
knowledge because they cost more money (121:52 - 121:57)
right like people who have been there (121:55 - 121:59)
for a long time who have those skills (121:57 - 122:01)
who are invested in those Community (121:59 - 122:03)
things or you don't take care of them (122:01 - 122:05)
you're driving off Community managers (122:03 - 122:07)
who are getting death threats and you (122:05 - 122:09)
aren't taking care of them and they (122:07 - 122:11)
leave and they take that knowledge and (122:09 - 122:13)
they take that experience and they take (122:11 - 122:17)
those answers with them (122:13 - 122:17)
yeah I mean like it comes down to money (122:20 - 122:24)
do you want to invest the money into a (122:21 - 122:26)
big city where you have more customers (122:24 - 122:28)
and a those customers have a better (122:26 - 122:30)
experience playing the game or do you (122:28 - 122:32)
want to invest that money in (122:30 - 122:33)
you know in the middle of nowhere where (122:32 - 122:35)
you have less customers and they're (122:33 - 122:36)
already upset that they're they're great (122:35 - 122:38)
they're okay I mean do you want to (122:36 - 122:40)
invest in the money in me or do you want (122:38 - 122:42)
to visit and Steve and Hannah (122:40 - 122:44)
I am not the person you're investing (122:42 - 122:47)
money right like Greg's already okay (122:44 - 122:49)
sorry Greg's already better and checked (122:47 - 122:52)
out of the game I don't I don't enjoy (122:49 - 122:54)
the main Loop of this game anymore I (122:52 - 122:57)
don't find the daily incense stuff fun I (122:54 - 123:01)
don't find raids interesting I don't (122:57 - 123:03)
there are so many things that it like (123:01 - 123:06)
you know I have luxury ball choices I (123:03 - 123:08)
don't ever have that in this game I I (123:06 - 123:10)
don't have (123:08 - 123:13)
the way to move things over (123:10 - 123:15)
um there are a lot of just general life (123:13 - 123:18)
things that I prefer out of my game that (123:15 - 123:20)
I don't get in go I don't see them (123:18 - 123:24)
coming anytime soon so I am not the (123:20 - 123:26)
person they should write like I go out (123:24 - 123:29)
only to spend time with my friends (123:26 - 123:32)
the game is secondary I don't make time (123:29 - 123:34)
for this game anymore because I don't (123:32 - 123:37)
enjoy it (123:34 - 123:37)
yeah I've gone on and off of it over the (123:38 - 123:42)
last few years because the community (123:41 - 123:46)
aspect really was my favorite part (123:42 - 123:48)
it brought me community in many many (123:46 - 123:51)
different places and I do still love the (123:48 - 123:54)
game I think largely because of that (123:51 - 123:56)
because I still do have communities (123:54 - 123:58)
based around it they're largely online (123:56 - 124:00)
right now partially because I have (123:58 - 124:02)
physically moved four times in the last (124:00 - 124:04)
year and I have not been able to (124:02 - 124:06)
maintain a solid Pokemon go Community (124:04 - 124:08)
through all of that (124:06 - 124:10)
um and I want this game to work for as (124:08 - 124:12)
many people want to play it but (124:10 - 124:15)
it's not an easy question and answer (124:12 - 124:17)
well the community thing was another (124:15 - 124:18)
thing that was brought up and Michael (124:17 - 124:20)
gave a very (124:18 - 124:22)
um yeah that frustrated me I'm sorry (124:20 - 124:25)
that's where I'm angry before we get off (124:22 - 124:27)
that I I also want to stress to people (124:25 - 124:30)
why do you still comp like (124:27 - 124:32)
your ableness (124:30 - 124:36)
is temporary oh yeah yeah you can (124:32 - 124:39)
quickly find yourself into (124:36 - 124:42)
a customer that no longer fits their (124:39 - 124:44)
model (124:42 - 124:48)
through whatever happens dance and that (124:44 - 124:51)
is a thing that they are not saying is (124:48 - 124:54)
we are making it for a very specific (124:51 - 124:57)
type of person and that specific type of (124:54 - 125:01)
person is highly temporary (124:57 - 125:05)
for everybody you will age your body (125:01 - 125:09)
will change your your city your state (125:05 - 125:13)
the weather you may move everything that (125:09 - 125:16)
they build for their game that customer (125:13 - 125:19)
is temporary and they aren't really (125:16 - 125:22)
facing that (125:19 - 125:22)
I don't disagree (125:24 - 125:29)
um so (125:27 - 125:32)
the community thing that made I'm (125:29 - 125:34)
excited for what made Hannah mad I'm (125:32 - 125:36)
here for this (125:34 - 125:38)
uh (125:36 - 125:40)
again none of their answers surprised me (125:38 - 125:43)
be like I live in the middle of nowhere (125:40 - 125:44)
we'll just play a different game yep (125:43 - 125:45)
that makes sense like that's kind of (125:44 - 125:48)
what I expected them to say like uh why (125:45 - 125:49)
do you care about walking because it (125:48 - 125:51)
makes our game different yep that makes (125:49 - 125:53)
sense like no surprises here the (125:51 - 125:55)
community thing was (125:53 - 125:57)
what about all the online communities (125:55 - 126:00)
that we've made they're kind of gone now (125:57 - 126:02)
because of remote raid passes and you (126:00 - 126:04)
want us to go back outside and Michael's (126:02 - 126:07)
answer I'm paraphrasing here uh was you (126:04 - 126:10)
can make online communities with any (126:07 - 126:13)
game that is online yeah you can't but (126:10 - 126:16)
those games can't create a local (126:13 - 126:19)
community that you can go to (126:16 - 126:23)
yeah which there is truth to that there (126:19 - 126:27)
is no there is no lies detected you can (126:23 - 126:30)
you can create local communities on (126:27 - 126:32)
online games that is absolutely a thing (126:30 - 126:35)
that can happen and also another thing (126:32 - 126:37)
mentioned in this whole section of the (126:35 - 126:39)
interview was when Zoe asked if there (126:37 - 126:41)
were any upcoming things to support (126:39 - 126:43)
online communities and the answer was (126:41 - 126:45)
not this year (126:43 - 126:45)
Oh I thought he said campfire (126:45 - 126:50)
that's not really an online community (126:48 - 126:53)
thing well there's like a slack chat (126:50 - 126:56)
Discord thing in campfire no the answer (126:53 - 126:58)
was not this year (126:56 - 126:58)
um he did bring up campfire at one point (126:59 - 127:03)
I thought it was the same question but (127:01 - 127:05)
um I thought he talked about campfire (127:03 - 127:07)
for a little bit uh (127:05 - 127:09)
but I mean like he used an example (127:07 - 127:12)
which I think is a good example (127:09 - 127:15)
um he did an example where like (127:12 - 127:18)
uh during like a raid train somebody (127:15 - 127:20)
stopped and was like what are you guys (127:18 - 127:21)
doing and he was like oh we're playing (127:20 - 127:24)
Pokemon go and they were like Oh I (127:21 - 127:26)
thought that game was like dead and they (127:24 - 127:27)
were like no there's like a bunch of us (127:26 - 127:29)
doing it and then that inspired that (127:27 - 127:31)
person to like redownload the game and (127:29 - 127:33)
that's like something you don't really (127:31 - 127:35)
get that that wouldn't (127:33 - 127:38)
that's something that kind of is I (127:35 - 127:40)
shouldn't say exclusive but like unique (127:38 - 127:42)
to like a bunch of Pokemon people out (127:40 - 127:44)
there playing to be like oh look at all (127:42 - 127:46)
these people in my city or in my town (127:44 - 127:49)
doing this thing that I could be a part (127:46 - 127:50)
of (127:49 - 127:52)
um which like I can kind of relate to (127:50 - 127:53)
that in the sense of like when I got (127:52 - 127:56)
really into Netrunner which is like this (127:53 - 127:58)
uh asymmetrical card game I was like (127:56 - 128:00)
really excited to play and then I (127:58 - 128:01)
realized no one in Milwaukee played (128:00 - 128:03)
Netrunner and I was like well this sucks (128:01 - 128:05)
because I just bought 200 worth of cards (128:03 - 128:07)
and I could only play with like two (128:05 - 128:10)
people in my household and I I want to (128:07 - 128:13)
play this game but literally no one in (128:10 - 128:15)
Milwaukee plays not Runner maybe people (128:13 - 128:17)
in Minneapolis played but uh there there (128:15 - 128:20)
was there was a huge Netrunner Community (128:17 - 128:21)
but then they said they weren't doing (128:20 - 128:24)
the game anymore yeah yeah they they're (128:21 - 128:27)
gonna think that Community died (128:24 - 128:28)
um yeah that game doesn't exist anymore (128:27 - 128:31)
but so like there is value and be like (128:28 - 128:32)
oh the (128:31 - 128:34)
people in my town are into this game and (128:32 - 128:36)
I can now be into this game with them (128:34 - 128:39)
and that doesn't exist if everyone is (128:36 - 128:41)
sitting at home doing remote raids and (128:39 - 128:43)
no one's going outside (128:41 - 128:45)
but raids don't have to be the only tool (128:43 - 128:47)
to get people to go outside correct (128:45 - 128:50)
that's the problems I mean that is and (128:47 - 128:52)
he straight up said that he straight up (128:50 - 128:55)
said that that raids were the main tool (128:52 - 128:57)
for getting people outside or something (128:55 - 128:59)
very similar to that and that frustrates (128:57 - 129:02)
me because you you can make events like (128:59 - 129:03)
the golden event that we had yesterday (129:02 - 129:06)
which was a great event and got Steve (129:03 - 129:08)
and I out (129:06 - 129:11)
playing outside a ton I saw other people (129:08 - 129:13)
playing this game there were people out (129:11 - 129:15)
and playing I mean Community Days aren't (129:13 - 129:17)
based on raids that's another type of (129:15 - 129:19)
event where you get people outside in (129:17 - 129:21)
community playing this game that isn't (129:19 - 129:25)
based on raids and I do think there are (129:21 - 129:27)
opportunities that they could Implement (129:25 - 129:31)
things where online friends from online (129:27 - 129:35)
communities could support one another (129:31 - 129:36)
in ways that get people to go outside (129:35 - 129:39)
more so that both helps online (129:36 - 129:42)
communities and it helps people play the (129:39 - 129:45)
way that they want people to play so one (129:42 - 129:46)
thing that kind of came to me because (129:45 - 129:48)
his feedback (129:46 - 129:50)
when he said we're not focusing on (129:48 - 129:51)
online communities this year that made (129:50 - 129:53)
me mad and my brain started thinking (129:51 - 129:55)
about all the ways they could focus on (129:53 - 129:57)
online communities and my brain went to (129:55 - 130:00)
O powers from Pokemon X and Y (129:57 - 130:02)
um (130:00 - 130:02)
and if there were some sort of thing (130:03 - 130:07)
where I could walk five kilometers and (130:05 - 130:09)
then be able to send three minutes of (130:07 - 130:12)
better hatch distance to a friend I (130:09 - 130:14)
would absolutely do that I would (130:12 - 130:16)
absolutely do this cool thing to give my (130:14 - 130:18)
friend a small little boost but Hannah (130:16 - 130:20)
you can spend five dollars and you can (130:18 - 130:23)
send Greg the surfing pose (130:20 - 130:25)
[Laughter] (130:23 - 130:28)
[Music] (130:25 - 130:28)
I'm completely wasted but but with the O (130:29 - 130:34)
power thing that would both get me out (130:32 - 130:38)
and walking or out and moving to get the (130:34 - 130:40)
O power and it would get the person (130:38 - 130:43)
receiving the O power to go out and play (130:40 - 130:45)
it the way they want them to play it's (130:43 - 130:48)
there are ways to do this (130:45 - 130:51)
there are other ways like if you if you (130:48 - 130:53)
could send (130:51 - 130:55)
you know a souped-up incense to some (130:53 - 130:58)
like you've done x amount of walking (130:55 - 131:00)
whatever and you can send that to (130:58 - 131:02)
somebody in the Royal area that creates (131:00 - 131:03)
a bunch of spawns for them like there (131:02 - 131:07)
are ways of doing that right like given (131:03 - 131:08)
people who play the game enough time (131:07 - 131:10)
they'll come up with with (131:08 - 131:14)
Solutions I I just think (131:10 - 131:17)
we need to (131:14 - 131:20)
in general come to the understanding (131:17 - 131:21)
that they aren't necessarily really (131:20 - 131:23)
looking for those Solutions (131:21 - 131:28)
because we can come up with them (131:23 - 131:28)
yeah I mean like I the only the only (131:28 - 131:33)
thing I I think I can like slightly (131:31 - 131:34)
relate to (131:33 - 131:36)
um that is a new talking point for this (131:34 - 131:38)
conversation is when I had when I had (131:36 - 131:40)
dinner with John Henke it wasn't really (131:38 - 131:41)
dinner with John Hickey it was a bunch (131:40 - 131:43)
of us like sitting down and then John (131:41 - 131:45)
coming over with his beer and then like (131:43 - 131:47)
chatting with us for a couple minutes (131:45 - 131:49)
and then getting on his private yacht uh (131:47 - 131:51)
and then sailing away (131:49 - 131:54)
um there was no yacht (131:51 - 131:56)
um but when we we were in Germany and he (131:54 - 131:58)
came over and he he was asking us what (131:56 - 132:00)
like wait we liked about the event that (131:58 - 132:01)
was the (132:00 - 132:03)
um Germany go Fest (132:01 - 132:05)
and he was asking us what we could (132:03 - 132:07)
improve or what he didn't like (132:05 - 132:08)
um (132:07 - 132:10)
and (132:08 - 132:12)
one of the things that I said that I (132:10 - 132:15)
really liked is I said I loved at the (132:12 - 132:17)
start of every hour there was like a (132:15 - 132:19)
wave of Pokemon (132:17 - 132:22)
um so I think they they started this in (132:19 - 132:25)
um ah not Madrid uh the place in Spain (132:22 - 132:27)
that I can't think of right now uh where (132:25 - 132:29)
they started it with like core fish (132:27 - 132:30)
where core fish would spawn every hour (132:29 - 132:34)
and then in the Germany go Fest it was (132:30 - 132:36)
uh unknown so at the start of every hour (132:34 - 132:38)
of go Fest like a bunch of unknown (132:36 - 132:39)
spawned and they would last I think for (132:38 - 132:40)
like two or three minutes and then they (132:39 - 132:43)
would go away and it was really cool and (132:40 - 132:44)
they did this at the Seattle go Fest I (132:43 - 132:46)
think too (132:44 - 132:46)
um (132:46 - 132:48)
and they probably did the Japan go fast (132:46 - 132:50)
I didn't go to that one (132:48 - 132:52)
um but when he when I brought that up uh (132:50 - 132:53)
and a couple other people were like oh (132:52 - 132:56)
yeah I love that feature yeah (132:53 - 132:56)
uh he said that like one of the things (132:57 - 133:01)
that he would like to see in the future (132:59 - 133:04)
was instead of those Pokemon just (133:01 - 133:06)
popping up for a couple minutes and then (133:04 - 133:07)
despawning (133:06 - 133:09)
he said that like that didn't really (133:07 - 133:10)
like (133:09 - 133:13)
fit the vision of the game because like (133:10 - 133:15)
it's weird for Pokemon just to pop in (133:13 - 133:17)
and then pop out and he said it would be (133:15 - 133:19)
really cool if one day they could get it (133:17 - 133:23)
where like Pokemon were migrating in (133:19 - 133:25)
real time in the game so like you had (133:23 - 133:27)
like a herd of like poochie I know that (133:25 - 133:30)
like started in like Seattle and then (133:27 - 133:32)
started moving through North America and (133:30 - 133:35)
that like oh like this the the Poochyena (133:32 - 133:38)
are like in Wyoming right now and like (133:35 - 133:39)
soon they'll be in Minneapolis and then (133:38 - 133:41)
after that they'll be in Chicago because (133:39 - 133:43)
they're like moving in like real time (133:41 - 133:45)
and that would feel like the game was (133:43 - 133:49)
like living and that like it felt like a (133:45 - 133:52)
natural spawn occurrence in the game and (133:49 - 133:55)
I thought that was like really cool and (133:52 - 133:57)
it was like a really great vision but (133:55 - 134:02)
also probably extremely complicated to (133:57 - 134:03)
also like (134:02 - 134:07)
okay so they're in Seattle uh and they (134:03 - 134:10)
showed up in Wyoming at 1am right yes (134:07 - 134:12)
like and where's the communication (134:10 - 134:14)
around that the communications (134:12 - 134:17)
communication like it's an interesting (134:14 - 134:19)
Vision except I always laugh because (134:17 - 134:20)
like we don't want Pokemon popping in (134:19 - 134:22)
I'm like have you ever played a base (134:20 - 134:25)
Pokemon game (134:22 - 134:25)
disappear for no reason that's the whole (134:26 - 134:30)
thing (134:29 - 134:32)
but I mean that would also be cool in a (134:30 - 134:35)
main Series game where like you're (134:32 - 134:37)
you're in the wild area of paldea and (134:35 - 134:38)
like a bunch of growlith come running (134:37 - 134:40)
through and then it's like oh they're (134:38 - 134:42)
only running through on Saturday morning (134:40 - 134:44)
or something like that I mean it would (134:42 - 134:47)
be that without breaks right like (134:44 - 134:50)
that's kind of what outbreaks were (134:47 - 134:52)
and that's kind of what the the roaming (134:50 - 134:54)
like they do with the roaming (134:52 - 134:57)
legendaries like (134:54 - 134:59)
the weather's weird over here go go (134:57 - 135:01)
figure it out (134:59 - 135:03)
um (135:01 - 135:03)
uh I'm looking to see if we missed any (135:06 - 135:10)
questions here (135:08 - 135:12)
uh they we talked about how they want (135:10 - 135:14)
they probably should have limited remote (135:12 - 135:17)
rate passes at the start (135:14 - 135:19)
um (135:17 - 135:22)
one comment that really stood out to me (135:19 - 135:24)
is when he said that (135:22 - 135:27)
the way they are planning the rest of (135:24 - 135:29)
this year to go (135:27 - 135:31)
he sees Pokemon go at the end of this (135:29 - 135:34)
year as a very different game than it (135:31 - 135:36)
was at the start of this year (135:34 - 135:39)
and that interests me there seems to be (135:36 - 135:42)
a lot of expectation that the rest of (135:39 - 135:45)
this year is gonna be big and exciting (135:42 - 135:47)
and I'm not (135:45 - 135:50)
sure how much I believe that Zoe's Zoe (135:47 - 135:53)
kind of said that things were neat (135:50 - 135:54)
um (135:53 - 135:57)
from what they got to see but I don't (135:54 - 135:59)
know it there is the expectation that (135:57 - 136:00)
the rest of this year is going to be big (135:59 - 136:03)
and exciting that they're setting up (136:00 - 136:05)
and I'm kind of waiting to see if that (136:03 - 136:07)
happens (136:05 - 136:09)
yeah I mean usually around the summer (136:07 - 136:11)
they announced like a new feature or (136:09 - 136:13)
something of the sort right because like (136:11 - 136:15)
summer is their summer is their (136:13 - 136:17)
Christmas or American Summer is there is (136:15 - 136:20)
there Christmas for it so (136:17 - 136:24)
the southern hemisphere is winter so yep (136:20 - 136:25)
yeah but there are more people in the (136:24 - 136:26)
northern yeah you gotta go where the (136:25 - 136:28)
people are Greg (136:26 - 136:29)
yeah (136:28 - 136:32)
only go where the people are yeah us (136:29 - 136:35)
Japan and Europe they're they're three (136:32 - 136:38)
biggest markets are all there summer (136:35 - 136:40)
um (136:38 - 136:40)
they what was it there was two things I (136:40 - 136:45)
want to mention oh location data (136:43 - 136:47)
um where Zoe was like hey are you (136:45 - 136:48)
selling her location data because your (136:47 - 136:51)
press release was like everyone pointed (136:48 - 136:53)
out that you weren't selling individual (136:51 - 136:55)
data and he was like I'm so glad you (136:53 - 136:56)
asked this question I'm really excited (136:55 - 136:58)
to answer it he was like nope we don't (136:56 - 137:00)
sell your location data we never have (136:58 - 137:03)
um he's like the thing that we do share (137:00 - 137:05)
with advertisers is if they have a (137:03 - 137:07)
pokestop we can tell them exactly how (137:05 - 137:10)
many times that pokestop has been spun (137:07 - 137:11)
um (137:10 - 137:13)
which (137:11 - 137:15)
is I'm pretty sure something we said on (137:13 - 137:17)
the show that like I bet they use the (137:15 - 137:19)
pokestop spins of like hey this this (137:17 - 137:22)
mall America gets a hundred a hundred (137:19 - 137:25)
thousand spins uh a week and the (137:22 - 137:27)
pokestop down in the middle of the ocean (137:25 - 137:31)
gets two spins a week uh I mean I (137:27 - 137:34)
again go read there (137:31 - 137:37)
policy privacy policy because (137:34 - 137:40)
they're real corporatey about that well (137:37 - 137:43)
privacy policies are pretty standard (137:41 - 137:45)
um but like that we're gonna know (137:43 - 137:47)
exactly the answer is pretty carpety (137:45 - 137:49)
because (137:47 - 137:52)
they aren't individual but not Anonymous (137:49 - 137:55)
and aggregate that uh is certainly on (137:52 - 137:56)
the table (137:55 - 137:58)
I I would not yeah I I like I would not (137:56 - 138:01)
be surprised if they (137:58 - 138:04)
they take their two months of what is it (138:01 - 138:07)
Kung Fu tea yeah right and they're like (138:04 - 138:10)
we turn 350 Kung Fu teas into pokestops (138:07 - 138:13)
or gyms this is how many spins they got (138:10 - 138:15)
this is their increased revenue of (138:13 - 138:16)
traffic this is how many people yeah (138:15 - 138:19)
including here's Steve cerumi's uh (138:16 - 138:22)
address here is his Social Security uh (138:19 - 138:23)
like they're they probably they probably (138:22 - 138:25)
take all that stuff oh yeah and they (138:23 - 138:26)
package it up and then they go to (138:25 - 138:28)
another company and they're like this is (138:26 - 138:30)
the success that Kung Fu tea and Pokemon (138:28 - 138:33)
go had would you like to (138:30 - 138:37)
turn your business into a pokestop and (138:33 - 138:41)
like you could argue like (138:37 - 138:43)
my personal opinion is that doesn't (138:41 - 138:44)
bother me (138:43 - 138:48)
uh like sure I spun the Kung Fu's tea I (138:44 - 138:49)
gave them one activation like they (138:48 - 138:51)
probably don't actually give them my (138:49 - 138:53)
address right like but they they say (138:51 - 138:54)
like this customer signed up right like (138:53 - 138:56)
you had a bunch of you had like this (138:54 - 138:58)
customer Spin and then sign up I don't (138:56 - 139:00)
mind that because I do think and Michael (138:58 - 139:03)
says this is like they try to work with (139:00 - 139:05)
brands that would only add more (139:03 - 139:07)
pokestops or attract more customers (139:05 - 139:09)
which only makes the game better which (139:07 - 139:13)
when they for whatever reason like all (139:09 - 139:15)
of the Boost Mobiles and Sprints were (139:13 - 139:17)
like pokestops and gyms because they had (139:15 - 139:18)
a deal with Sprint and Boost Mobile (139:17 - 139:21)
right and then when that deal ended they (139:18 - 139:22)
just removed the gyms and the pokestops (139:21 - 139:24)
and it was so frustrating because I had (139:22 - 139:26)
a Boost Mobile (139:24 - 139:29)
down the street in the street from me in (139:26 - 139:31)
Milwaukee and it was like I would do (139:29 - 139:32)
this loop at the end of the night I (139:31 - 139:34)
would like leave my house like walk to (139:32 - 139:36)
this bar spin this pokestop walk down (139:34 - 139:37)
spin these two pokestops one of them (139:36 - 139:39)
being Boost Mobile turn around and like (139:37 - 139:42)
that's those pokestops just disappeared (139:39 - 139:46)
when that deal ended so like (139:42 - 139:49)
he he does say that again he says like (139:46 - 139:51)
when we sign these deals it does make (139:49 - 139:53)
the game better because we can add all (139:51 - 139:55)
these new activations that we weren't (139:53 - 139:57)
paying attention to before so that's (139:55 - 139:58)
good (139:57 - 139:59)
um but I'm assuming that's what they're (139:58 - 140:02)
doing with our data is like packaging it (139:59 - 140:05)
up and saying like this like (140:02 - 140:08)
here you go uh Caribou Coffee would you (140:05 - 140:10)
we did such a good job with Starbucks (140:08 - 140:12)
right (140:10 - 140:15)
or you know they can they can like track (140:12 - 140:18)
again it's one of the reasons that it (140:15 - 140:20)
makes you know what one of the reasons (140:18 - 140:23)
why raid days are are smaller it's it's (140:20 - 140:25)
easier to get that sort of aggregate (140:23 - 140:28)
tracking spin data on the smaller window (140:25 - 140:30)
then on a larger one you're getting more (140:28 - 140:33)
concentrated information of how your (140:30 - 140:35)
customer base moves like moving out (140:33 - 140:37)
through the game right so like when you (140:35 - 140:38)
have a smaller window and you're forcing (140:37 - 140:40)
everybody to be together you're getting (140:38 - 140:42)
better data than when it was spread out (140:40 - 140:44)
over six hours and people were coming (140:42 - 140:46)
and going right like there's different (140:44 - 140:47)
data you're getting from both and (140:46 - 140:49)
ultimately the smaller window crates (140:47 - 140:52)
just it's a better thing to go to (140:49 - 140:54)
advertisers than other people with say (140:52 - 140:56)
like this is what we present we can (140:54 - 140:57)
present traffic Movement we can present (140:56 - 140:59)
activations we can do all these things (140:57 - 141:02)
and it's not your personal data it is (140:59 - 141:04)
aggregated Data where your personality (141:02 - 141:06)
is tripped out and your comfort with (141:04 - 141:08)
that again this goes back to what will (141:06 - 141:10)
happen with sleep your comfort with them (141:08 - 141:12)
having aggregate data about your medical (141:10 - 141:16)
call stuff in your sleep schedules is up (141:12 - 141:18)
to you how comfortable you feel having (141:16 - 141:21)
that Anonymous (141:18 - 141:24)
overarching stuff sent out (141:21 - 141:26)
I do think sleep is going to need a lot (141:24 - 141:28)
more personal data than Pokemon oh I (141:26 - 141:30)
guarantee it but we'll we'll burn that (141:28 - 141:32)
bridge when we get there I still think (141:30 - 141:34)
the shocking thing is like we're seven (141:32 - 141:35)
years in and it just doesn't feel like (141:34 - 141:37)
Niantic strikes that many deals with (141:35 - 141:40)
companies no like the Kung Fu tea thing (141:37 - 141:42)
is kind of shocking of like (141:40 - 141:45)
oh I I because I feel like we would just (141:42 - 141:47)
get one of those like a month of like (141:45 - 141:50)
I feel like we they don't I feel like (141:47 - 141:53)
they play a very smart game of they (141:50 - 141:55)
don't make the deals that they're making (141:53 - 141:57)
very obvious because I guarantee they (141:55 - 141:59)
are doing things behind the scenes for (141:57 - 142:02)
advertising for other things that that (141:59 - 142:05)
are much more hidden and hard to see I (142:02 - 142:06)
think they understand that when people (142:05 - 142:09)
see deals like that happen if they (142:06 - 142:11)
happen on a regular clip especially when (142:09 - 142:13)
people are already saying like how are (142:11 - 142:15)
you selling my personal data I think (142:13 - 142:17)
they are they play a very smart game in (142:15 - 142:20)
limiting how much that actually makes (142:17 - 142:22)
itself apparent in the game so it's easy (142:20 - 142:25)
to not think about (142:22 - 142:25)
uh another thing Michael confirmed was (142:28 - 142:32)
like the Pikmin team is working on (142:30 - 142:34)
Pikmin the Pokemon go team is working on (142:32 - 142:35)
Pokemon like (142:34 - 142:38)
it's not like what what was the new (142:35 - 142:39)
thing there oh the Monster Hunter stuff (142:38 - 142:41)
where they announced like a monster (142:39 - 142:42)
hunter game and people were like well (142:41 - 142:44)
that that they don't care about Pokemon (142:42 - 142:46)
go anymore it's like no that's a that's (142:44 - 142:49)
a whole different team another team (142:46 - 142:52)
uh so he did answer that I mean people (142:49 - 142:56)
people who worked on go may switch over (142:52 - 142:59)
to that team right like sure yeah yeah (142:56 - 143:02)
it is a separate team that is forming it (142:59 - 143:04)
does not mean they're taking resources (143:02 - 143:07)
away from go people may from go move (143:04 - 143:08)
over there but most likely they will (143:07 - 143:11)
backfill those positions (143:08 - 143:13)
right (143:11 - 143:15)
um anything else anything else that we (143:13 - 143:18)
missed I'm looking through my notes um (143:15 - 143:20)
and I think that the only thing is just (143:18 - 143:22)
that they kind of started and ended the (143:20 - 143:24)
interview with Michael saying that they (143:22 - 143:26)
haven't been very good at communication (143:24 - 143:27)
and he's hoping that they can get better (143:26 - 143:29)
communication so (143:27 - 143:30)
interview (143:29 - 143:33)
[Laughter] (143:30 - 143:35)
yeah yeah they did start off with like (143:33 - 143:36)
the dev diary stuff which was like (143:35 - 143:39)
niantic's way of communication and then (143:36 - 143:40)
Michael was like yeah we did a bad job (143:39 - 143:42)
at this we bit off more than we could (143:40 - 143:44)
chew we couldn't put him out every other (143:42 - 143:45)
month so they weren't we probably should (143:44 - 143:47)
have told you yeah and then he was like (143:45 - 143:49)
we probably should have told you we (143:47 - 143:50)
couldn't do this anymore but you know (143:49 - 143:52)
we're telling you now we'll do that (143:50 - 143:53)
we'll still do Dev Diaries but they'll (143:52 - 143:56)
be when they feel appropriate (143:53 - 143:59)
um and we will see when they happen if (143:56 - 144:01)
they are actually Dev Diaries or if (143:59 - 144:03)
they're just advertisements again (144:01 - 144:06)
yeah I mean like (144:03 - 144:08)
I did still feel like the dev Diaries (144:06 - 144:11)
were like there's a lot of nothing here (144:08 - 144:13)
um when I when I played Destiny they (144:11 - 144:15)
would Bungie would do like a Dev update (144:13 - 144:17)
every like Thursday and if you ever went (144:15 - 144:19)
to like the subreddit well if you want a (144:17 - 144:22)
toxic suburb it just need the game r (144:19 - 144:24)
slash but like (144:22 - 144:25)
it would just be people like there's (144:24 - 144:26)
nothing in this update and it's like (144:25 - 144:28)
well how much do you expect them to do (144:26 - 144:32)
in like six days like that's like like (144:28 - 144:34)
every single week we get an update (144:32 - 144:35)
they're all not going to be exciting (144:34 - 144:37)
yeah like sometimes they are having been (144:35 - 144:40)
on a developer team I am not surprised (144:37 - 144:42)
if every month was a little bit too much (144:40 - 144:43)
for that kind of thing but also I know (144:42 - 144:45)
that what the players wanted was (144:43 - 144:47)
explanations for decisions (144:45 - 144:49)
and what they didn't give in any of the (144:47 - 144:51)
dev Diaries was explanations for (144:49 - 144:54)
decisions I think one of them the PVP (144:51 - 144:57)
one was close (144:54 - 144:57)
he does have a whole section on PVP and (144:57 - 145:01)
how much he likes it and the bugs and (144:59 - 145:04)
the frustration but I I will say that (145:01 - 145:07)
it is naive to think that a corporation (145:04 - 145:09)
is ever going to explain their decisions (145:07 - 145:11)
to you (145:09 - 145:11)
I mean they or have the ability to try (145:14 - 145:18)
to spin it in a positive way sometimes (145:17 - 145:20)
you just don't have a way to spin it (145:18 - 145:21)
they don't have a way to spin them I (145:20 - 145:24)
mean that the answers you are going to (145:21 - 145:28)
get are PR approved so like just (145:24 - 145:31)
understand you are never going to get (145:28 - 145:34)
transparency from a corporation that is (145:31 - 145:36)
just not a thing (145:34 - 145:38)
that's kind of why I was like okay with (145:36 - 145:40)
this interview because like (145:38 - 145:42)
I think the only question he kind of (145:40 - 145:43)
shied away from or not like he didn't (145:42 - 145:45)
even shy away from it he was just like (145:43 - 145:46)
I'm done talking about this was like the (145:45 - 145:48)
remote raid like he was pretty much like (145:46 - 145:50)
should have been Limited (145:48 - 145:51)
we needed to increase the price because (145:50 - 145:53)
it was unbalancing everything else in (145:51 - 145:56)
the store I mean yeah it sucks yeah but (145:53 - 145:57)
like and then he was like can we kind of (145:56 - 145:59)
move on because like what else how I (145:57 - 146:02)
can't spin this anymore like there's it (145:59 - 146:03)
sucks like yeah what do you want me to (146:02 - 146:06)
talk in circles here I mean people just (146:03 - 146:09)
need to understand that the answer is it (146:06 - 146:11)
sucks and there's never going to be a (146:09 - 146:13)
better answer yeah yeah that was the (146:11 - 146:14)
only question where it was like kind of (146:13 - 146:16)
obvious where he was like (146:14 - 146:18)
we're let's move on because like I can't (146:16 - 146:21)
I nothing's gonna make you happy (146:18 - 146:24)
play a different game (146:21 - 146:24)
let's look at that man that answer was (146:27 - 146:31)
so like yup yeah is he gonna say it is (146:28 - 146:33)
it oh yeah he said it just play a (146:31 - 146:35)
different game he just he just said it (146:33 - 146:38)
okay all right (146:35 - 146:38)
thank you for what it's worth I suppose (146:38 - 146:42)
um (146:42 - 146:46)
Niantic has a vision and gosh darn it (146:43 - 146:48)
they are definitely sticking to that (146:46 - 146:50)
yeah (146:48 - 146:53)
a little bit for that (146:50 - 146:56)
they love they love their outdoor they (146:53 - 146:58)
love their outdoor game (146:56 - 147:00)
um (146:58 - 147:00)
I will say uh again I say this every (147:00 - 147:06)
episode I'm I'm very privileged to be in (147:03 - 147:08)
a very big city that also happens to (147:06 - 147:12)
have the best indoor place to play hands (147:08 - 147:14)
down yeah the indoor spot really gives (147:12 - 147:17)
you all a a big boost during the cold (147:14 - 147:19)
months (147:17 - 147:21)
I I honestly don't think I would have (147:19 - 147:24)
been able to play for a full what I (147:21 - 147:26)
probably what I wanted to do yesterday (147:24 - 147:28)
again personal story is I wanted to go (147:26 - 147:30)
to a park and play and I stepped outside (147:28 - 147:33)
and I was like it I can't do this it's (147:30 - 147:37)
too hot darn you Niantic it's 93 degrees (147:33 - 147:39)
out oh it was so hot yesterday and I (147:37 - 147:41)
went to Mall of America (147:39 - 147:43)
and there were Golden Lures everywhere (147:41 - 147:45)
things were lured up I could walk in a (147:43 - 147:46)
square there's bathrooms I get something (147:45 - 147:47)
to drink (147:46 - 147:49)
and after an hour I was like this is (147:47 - 147:51)
great this is I could there's no way I (147:49 - 147:55)
could have done this outside (147:51 - 147:55)
at all it's just it was just too hot I (147:55 - 147:59)
mean part of the problem is you wear 17 (147:57 - 148:01)
layers (147:59 - 148:03)
you could strip some of those layers (148:01 - 148:05)
down it's very comfortable yeah and I (148:03 - 148:07)
mean part of that starts to get into the (148:05 - 148:10)
places where there's more shade the (148:07 - 148:12)
places where there's more natural paths (148:10 - 148:16)
more trees unless it's a city park there (148:12 - 148:18)
aren't as many pokestops because you (148:16 - 148:19)
can't submit pokestops where there's not (148:18 - 148:22)
a sign or a placard yep that's that's a (148:19 - 148:24)
personal frustration it's not as big a (148:22 - 148:27)
problem as for people who live in rural (148:24 - 148:29)
areas and literally don't have the stuff (148:27 - 148:31)
around that's a little bit different but (148:29 - 148:33)
when I want to go on a hike and play (148:31 - 148:35)
Pokemon go at the same time I can't and (148:33 - 148:37)
that makes me sad (148:35 - 148:39)
yeah I wouldn't mind doing a hike but (148:37 - 148:40)
then I would be like oh there's no (148:39 - 148:41)
pokestops what am I supposed to be doing (148:40 - 148:44)
looking at nature I don't want to do (148:41 - 148:47)
you want to Dominic ketchup we don't (148:44 - 148:47)
I cannot imagine you on a hike I cannot (148:47 - 148:54)
can we can we I gotta figure out my foot (148:54 - 148:59)
thing first okay I'm just thinking (148:56 - 149:01)
within five minutes we are going to (148:59 - 149:02)
throw you off a cliff because you're (149:01 - 149:04)
complaining about your feet (149:02 - 149:06)
like 100 no the cracks are okay but I (149:04 - 149:08)
don't think Crocs are good hiking you (149:06 - 149:11)
can hiking Crocs yeah you can (149:08 - 149:12)
yeah (149:11 - 149:17)
hiking Crocs I've hiked in heels (149:12 - 149:17)
five (149:20 - 149:22)
can we put that in a shirt Hannah I've (149:23 - 149:26)
hiked in heels (149:25 - 149:29)
yes so what have you got big shot I mean (149:26 - 149:31)
I'm pretty against the idea of heels at (149:29 - 149:33)
this point I think they're bad for your (149:31 - 149:37)
feet but heels are awful I do not get it (149:33 - 149:40)
I mean I I get it but I don't like I'm (149:37 - 149:42)
one of those people who wears the the (149:40 - 149:44)
toe shoes they're like gloves for your (149:42 - 149:46)
feet those are my preferred shoes those (149:44 - 149:50)
are the last podcast (149:46 - 149:50)
we found the limit (149:50 - 149:53)
