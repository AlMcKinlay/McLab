[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 258th episode of the Pokemon podcast I'm your host SBJ and with me on this sunday at sunday we're recording on the right day uh I have with me on sunday sunday sunday is Travis Travis Travis I have absolutely no recollection of what we talked about last week on this program just seven days ago I remember setting up to record i remember being done recording but whatever happened in that amount of time in the middle is just a black hole in my memory so we were always been a really good one we were all very sick last week okay you even will wear though I mean I would I was pretty much over it i had to carry that show maybe that's why i don't remember it is because i was all the gears returning just making sure that I i held the two of you up on my shoulders hitting hitting every cylinder no wheel with us today he's in Virginia or something of the sort i don't think i think he's lying but that's alright we have micah here with us speaking of carrying people i hope i hope you're both ready to carry me through this my back's gonna hurt by at the at the end of this episode Steve's used to carrying me through pretty much anything anyways any yeah any and all content in the world i am i am carrying my god not sure that's why you bring him back like what is the no no Micah left behind is is the name of our new podcast that's right I don't even know what we're I'm just would be but I would listen it's just me being really bad at things and then asking Steve for help and then Steve carrying me through yeah kick off kick off next week uh uh out all serious notes this is a podcast about Pokemon where we rarely talk about pokemon that seems to line up with with what to show the pipeline this show has been going down but for this episode we have we have some news articles to go through and then we have a bunch of emails that we are going to talk about and that's pretty much it we're still in this this drought of not really enough content but because of emails we that fills that fills a really good void of both Pokemon and non Pokemon related questions that you guys send in so this is just our time the email time is now the email time is high now speaking of high have any of you gone skydiving pardon us trying transition here in all serious is what's new what's new but that was my transition Wow okay I thought you were gonna say like I thought we're gonna go to the news section you were gonna be like there's a new skydiving trick involving 50 people and they make the shape of a Pikachu this is our news article but no your way to get to what have you been up to what you won't believe what these skydivers are doing with these pikachus I won't even repeat it people heard it they can go back they can use the 15-second backward thing if every wires trainwreck of it transition again Wow before I forget this is this episode lines up with mudkipz so you know insert Mudkip joke here or don't and I just like don't do it because I just just stop so I mean it's not 2008 anymore or whenever that joke was at its height yeah that's true I do like Mudkip though i am i'm a fan of vine that evolutionary line it's pretty neat what's it as anything new happening anything noteworthy to bring up or should we just go into news i beat zelda that's not worthy how did you like it right the why i'm assuming not like zelda 1 right no I beat a Zelda for nes finally it took you awhile if several yeah yeah breath of the wild after over a hundred i well over a hundred hours in that game I feel like I'm safe and saying that it is my favorite Zelda of all time bar not time-barred none if you say it so many things right and would you see it would you say it a breath new life into the French hi yes I was really I would use the word breath it was very very good I think I'm Landon saying that anything hours and topped it for me would just be me hanging on to nostalgia what about winwaker winwaker is pretty good it was good but it doesn't do all of the amazing things that breadth of the wild does you're right it breath a while doesn't have a great boat that talks to you I mean if you you can get on a boat and then handle it yourself like say the job yeah you can pretend it's talking to you ah they should have an amiibo that gives you the boat in breath little Hannah boat and they hold my boat race this show is styling make rice happen for eyes yeah I'll never stop trying to make boat race happen Travis are you still playing pokemon duel oh no you've asked me that before and my answer was no like three weeks you know I wasn't sure c'mon evil isn't even on my phone anymore you why you come on doors yeah you're right you were so into Pokemon duel and then I I think I convinced you to switch to fire emblem and so are you still playing fire of them yeah I might I mean I don't want to be painted as like the number one that at any point I was like the number one Pokemon tool player on the world or anything I just thought it was a decent game too don't lie man I saw your Pokemon duel youtube channel yeah your Pokemon hey everybody here this is a dual master 69 69 coming in here with some hot tips you're gonna want to make sure you have the pieces with at least one or two pieces with three movement points you know moving point is actually the strongest stat in the game and if you're looking at a Pokemon with only one movement point I mean maybe put one of those on your team but you know I know you think like tyranitar oh it's so cool but like you really got to make sure you pay attention to movement points you need at least two or three and maybe one with one and the rest are our two but even then that with one is really gonna be hindering you because the movement point is the most important thing I'll just stop I'm sorry that was actually not Travis recording that that was actually a clip that we just played back from travis's Pokemon duel youtube channel I feel like you have the the the speed down of how fast youtubers talk I and yet time you have hey whats up guys that's the important part hey what's going on Gaia's because apparently no one other than men watches YouTube according to anyone who makes YouTube channels it so you know what's up hey guys it's your boy yeah uh and with regard to the speed of speaking I think I've talked it on the show about how I for a while was an assistant coach of a debate team the type of debate that I coached encouraged the rules of that type of debate sort of tacit Lee encouraged speaking as quickly as humanly possible is that is there a benefit there is there like six strategy there like that immunity if a strategic choice because at that type of debate which is called policy debate isn't necessarily about who is the most persuasive speaker but it's more about whose point is proved more by the facts that are presented in the round so because of that you're you have an incentive to just put out as many claims and warrants to those claims as is physically possible with your mouth and your vocal folds so that when your opponent goes up to speak they don't have enough time in there eight minute speech to make a response to all the things you said so you just end up winning because you said more things so it ends up being sort of a weird race to the bottom that sounds awful if you want if you want to have a good time good just go on youtube and search policy debate spreading spreading is the term they use it's quite a sight or quite an audible experience well speaking of spreading let's spread some Pokemon news out on the table here that was a much better segue Thank You Alan take it wit wasn't great but it definitely a B effort you know that they call me you they don't call me SB effort J for anything for nothing I call you a space cowboy shiny top Coco to be distributed in South Korea haven't had some South Korea news in a while but the Korean league spring tournament will get these shiny top of cocoa the Korean League tournament is held between 12pm to 5pm on april eighth and ninth at the Topaz hall on the 10th floor of the pangoro hyundai department store the taboo cocoa will be distributed via infrared for pokemon sun and moon during the tournament the taboo cocoa will be level 60 have the ability electric surge hold an electric seed and even though those were a thing I know the moves nature madness discharge agility and electro ball it's a regional trainer is something in Korean that I cannot say but it will be found in a cherish ball while top of cocoa in the game cannot be shiny making the Japanese distribution the only way to obtain it at pres is this true you can I get taboo Coco's taboo anything as shiny you can't soft reset for these I don't believe so huh happy nothing that's I I would be a fan of that just kind of gets rid of the whole software is set anything that gets off resetting it doesn't really good because then you need to starts off resetting for free and IVs and and stuff good to know that what was the munchies that you hadn't heard of maybe a couple extras with need electric seed yes so that's a is that new of Sun and Moon yeah it's a new held item what happens is it's a one-time use item so after you use it it's consumed although you can all of those sort of one-time use items if you use them in a competitive match over like a Wi-Fi battle than those items come back but if you use it like just in single-player it's one time use but anyway electric seat is an item that will raise the defense of a Pokemon when electric terrain is activated so because taboo cocoa causes a like electric terrain to activate just by its ability electric surge then it basically guarantees that electric seed will pop off increasing its defense by a stage so you get a free defense increase just right off the bat not a lot of people use it use like taboo cocoa with electric seed competitively because there are a lot better items you could use you know like focus ash gets a lot of use and I think life orb is the life orb and focus sash I think of the items that get use but I mean electric seat is there and it's an item cool good no Pokemon goes latest event is making everyone a Magikarp fan this article is off polygon I had just a the standard Pokemon go press release up but really what it says is that there are now more water pokemon for the link was water yeah water festival is what it's called it will have more water pokemon including Magikarp squirtle totodile another water pokemon more accessible that means if you don't live close to water and had difficulties encountering the set pokemon spending more ink in game time over the next week will increase your chances this will end on march 29th at four pm eastern time that was what i was looking for the end date but just like the last couple special events well well there's the holiday event which gave you the pikachu with the santa claus hat and then they gave their was the event to celebrate the 21st birthday of pokemon which gave you the pichu with the party hat looks like this event will give you a shiny magikarp if you are lucky enough and of course evolving that shiny magikarp will evolve into a shiny gyarados this is the first time we've seen a shiny in in pokemon go legally / officially i don't know what what other people are doing but legally first time we're getting shiny pokemon somebody in slacked a quick quick side story so there there ditto in the game then somebody found a shiny magikarp and they went to catch it and it turned into a ditto no way which is a real i would probably quit her mom go forever ah there's also an in celebration of Pokemon go water festival there is a all-new Magikarp at that is free that you can add to your wardrobe I don't know if the Hat yours alone it's great i don't know if the hat goes away I March twenty ninth and we don't know if if the the shiny magikarp also goes away on march 29th I'm assuming it does just because Pikachu party hat and peachy Santa hat went away so we'll see and I and I keep forgetting talk about this week after week but I've been playing a lot of Pokemon go ever since the johto pokemon got introduced I don't know if you two have been ailing it but I had like one actually strangely i actually have and mostly just because it's been really rainy around here it's gotten warmer but it's just been so rainy that i don't really have any yeah i've done I mean it's the same in Wisconsin right it's really cold so it's kind of hard to walk around but they added a bunch of new polka stops in the park near my work mica mica knows what park i'm talking about but that park originally only had like three polka stops like a year ago and they added by the way I don't work in Milwaukee I work in the middle of nowhere yeah there's still all that news about Milwaukee freaking out about Pokemon go and stuff and we'll probably have I'm waiting for more information but there is a there would have been a news article about that but anyways they pretty much doubled the amount of polka stops so from at least my desk I can see which pokémon are over in the park so my lunch I'll walk drive through the park because this because with the parking lot in the park touches like for polka stop so i'll drive into the park park spin catch and then go go actually get my lunch and then return to work so that's like I don't know it's it's like 10 minutes out of my day but I get at least one or two new pokemon that I haven't had before and yet that streak hey yeah you gotta hit that streak you got a new streak I have such I have so much trouble hitting that seven-day street because of weekends because I I'll usually go out on like a Saturday or sunday but I try not to go out one of those two days like just just the whole like well if I don't drive anywhere I can't spend any money right so I tried to do that once a week like I'm not going anywhere today just gonna stay at home and there's no poker stops near me unless I walk there and then that goes back to the whole thing of like it's really cool Wisconsin right now well the only solution is to move to a building that is either on top of a right next to a polka star yeah yeah is when I plan on buying a house the buck stops near it will will play a big role but you see that's dating bettering the housing market right yes so Mike a year you're playing pokemon go again I am yeah I've been playing it since jodoh too and I played it I hit like a really big spike right when joto launched and I've tapered off a little bit now but I'm still playing it pretty consistently and I have never really noticed before just because of my I guess activity level in the game the increased spawns when they've done increased bonds before but I am definitely noticing the increased waters bones like it's significant I'm happy that it's significant because I've always felt like oh it's increased bonds and it's I can see that like oh maybe I'm seeing some of that like when they did the increase bonds for the starters like I didn't really see that many I think other people probably did but I didn't so this time it's nice to be able to actually see increased bonds for water stuff I have yet to find a shiny magikarp uh but I have found it yeah I haven't found a shiny magikarp either now like I'm kind of stressing out because the the the end date is coming up and I yet have both the special Pikachu's so like I will be really bummed i think if i don't don't get a shiny the same position like I see plenty of regular Magikarp just not shiny yeah all right last bit of news I have is I think we might have touched on this last week but a little bit more fleshed out of an article here pikachu getting some iconic headwear in sun and moon later this year japanese pokemon fans have an adorable promotion to look forward to starting in April Pikachu with accessories will be distributed to the series latest nintendo 3ds games Pokemon Sun and Moon a collection of Pikachu wearing hats made famous by ash ketchum the star of the Pokemon anime will be available to anyone who buys tickets the upcoming film ahead of its premiere we did talk about this a little bit the latest issue of the Japanese gaming magazine court Korra revealed a whole new set of six scans which are found on which were found because of Sarah be theirs Pikachu in the classic ash cap of old and all the ways and all the way to the electric mouse wearing ashes oh Lola region variant hat Pokemon fans made Otis that there are only six different hats despite there being seven generations of Pokemon games ash wore his original cap for the first two generations of the Pokemon cartoon maintaining the same looks until the end of his travels in johto since then the 11 year old 11 year old mmm isn't he's 11 and ole ola ok the 11 year old has shaken up his look every season no word on a Western release for the ash hat-wearing Pikachu nor the film it's released tied to the movie titled I choose you is the 20th installment in the Pokemon featured film franchise it is a retelling of the TV shows very first episode it hits japanese theaters on July fifteenth is it a new animation or is it yeah ok it's like a new like the the animation they used for the sun and moon anime or not like well maybe are you doing are you talking about movie animation yeah the upcoming in see the trailer no I didn't ah is it good trailer it looks remember we talked about this last time it doesn't said that I never watched I didn't watch it yeah it doesn't look like I stole them it doesn't look like the sun and moon anime it just looks like the last movie animation that's kind of I mean you know whatever it's a little disappointing because I really like the animation and cinnamon but I think the sunday moon cartoon anime Hana may I think it's I think I think it's all right I don't know if there's more than two episodes yet I haven't recorded on my my playstation view but I don't they've shown episode three yet what's a Playstation of you that's a new 1i PlayStation view is internet TV so for 29 bucks a month it gets you like 35 channel 35 channel more than that maybe drop in thirty dollars 39 it's it's basically like cable but you're paying less for cable and you get pretty much everything you need for cable yeah it gives me it you get all of the channels that it that like cable would get you yeah like hgtv and Cartoon Network and whatever yeah so you watch it on your TV or your PlayStation I think Apple TV also has an app or chromecast but you get the Food Network you get food network yeah you get a bunch of chain might be where it might be worth it for thirty bucks worth it what's really cool so first off it gives you USA Today he gives us a which is how I watch my wrestling not USA Today right now you see that rested ah I guess you it gives you disney XD which lets you do all your Pokemon now mmm you Cartoon Network which used to do pokemon and I don't I don't think they're all they're not allowed to show reruns gives you TBS if you if you need your Seinfeld kick but what's really cool is it has like this DVR feature where you can say like hey record every episode of Pokemon and it doesn't care what channel it's on it'll just find that show and record it and it doesn't take up any storage on your device cuz everything this is starting to sound like that parable about the terrifying AI that goes and unselfish drawing the whole work because like you tell the AI like make make and store food for me and then the AI is like okay and that it ends up thinking well I can turn people into food and then destroys like everybody to make it sounds like if you're saying like record all episodes of Pokemon then it'll start like being like well this could theoretically be Pokemon so I should survey all of everything honest joke isn't really as funny as i thought it was ahead well that's the thing though right cuz its top model pokemon was I'm cartoonnetwork what so when I said hey record all poke mine when it made the jump to Disney that's cool I don't have to like retell it and then like like seinfeld is more just also it's like not all exclusively TBS so if there are other versions of it it will find those and record them and so then when you go to your like my shows if it found two of the same episode like hey we found Monday Night Raw on USA and sci-fi or whatever I don't think it's on self I it'll say which version do you want to watch now I know yeah PlayStation you know also actively so like you can set things to record to actually record or you can just select something as my show and then it will compile it and save it to like I don't know it just it's it's just like an available for on demand for anybody that saved it as their show so then there's two versions of that too like you can pick either the on-demand version or the version that you DVR'd as a whole new world of possibilities yeah I don't know if any of this is new for like as far as DVR goes but it's new to me cuz i've never had DVR before yeah i mean i don't use like i'll use the DVR feature to watch like reruns of shows or something but for the most part like my playstation view comes down to me using it every monday night for wrestling and then right what about those pokemon hats sorry I didn't mean it before anything sit down at the place a I feel I feel guilty for bringing things under the PlayStation view tangent just because I thought PlayStation view was a funny buzzword sounding branding term and now he spent like actually 20 minutes talking let the PlayStation to you and I feel bad so by 12 is leave a window that you through and it shows you can land a ship you a window to your house yes and in one pane that says play and then the other plane it says station and then when you're when you're sitting in front of it that is the view of the citation view it's a 24 it's a two pane window it's what it's when you want that product placement all over your house yeah yeah exactly well that wraps it up for news I have some we did it uh so what we'll do is we will take a quick break when we come back we will tackle your emails what's up everyone welcome to the Travis hot cast it's super Travis wow it's a wet burrito just over his place of the web for Rio go is a wet burrito just over boy of the web marido [Music] Oh Oh mr. West with no just oh so Wes torito just 30 and we are back from our break got some emails for you if you have any emails for us pokemon or non pokemon related you can send your email over to SB j @ pkmn cast dot-com or you can go to pokemon podcast com hit that contact button and that will get the email over there just as well so feel free to send in some emails we got a couple we have 24 will wells not here so I'm going to skip those or I can answer them for him I feel like I know will enough ones about how Y will hate Zelda because it's rolling in Zelda no it definitely can't answer that oh I cannot answer that he's he's wrong for not for hating Zelda that's the actually answer that way hates every way that's way levy under that question on to the next one wait I thought I was the one that hated Zelda know it's wrong then I think you have easy solution think you were both on similar pages Chris rights in kind I just want to make sure that that that we weren't forming some sort of singularity where we end up with some like will and Travis Oversoul that just has all of the attributes of both of us and then both of us become obsolete you know like I want to make sure I'd or I am the one the hands Elda that's the one that's the one thing I have I don't know it sounds like a pretty good plot for the podcast if Travis and will becomes too similar then I just have to cut one right but how will you know which one is which so I'm going to ship you a window and in one pain it's gonna say flashing something only the real PlayStation of you will know this emails from chris from Indianapolis hey SBJ will and Travis it was a Chris been a while since I've seen or talked to you guys i just wanted to respond to Travis about Pokemon go and the antics methods for catching Legendary's there is a gym rework going on right now according to multiple reports and comments from developers that could be released sometime between april through june they are working on making the experience more teamwork focused and rewarding when people get involved so this leads me to believe that the possibility of catching a mewtwo like the trailer depicts may not be as far off as we think of course we'll see what they end up doing in the long term and hope for the best keep up the good work and Travis if you want mall Chinese again I still live here and we'll plan on going to Nationals if you guys make it to any oh I didn't realize I didn't realize we were talking that it was this chris cool awesome sincerely the original Chris yes the one you're thinking of from any probably idiot from you Chris probably the I mean the only Chris in all of India I'm assuming the only one that I know and care about so yeah they're there I have also heard this I've seen many things about this Jim rework I did I did speaking of Pokemon go I did my first gym battle since the first week it came out I was at a gym parked in my car and it was a mystic gym and I am mystic so I think it does something where like powers up the gym I wasn't completely sure what I got a bunch of experience when I was done but yeah man your buff in the gym okay well if I didn't it didn't give me an option to leave my pokemon even though I did the work it may not so it so you can leave Pokemon there at certain levels there's certain amounts that you can leave per level of the gym so it could be that you just didn't level it up so that there was more room for you to leave a Pokemon yeah I think that was a edit yeah there's a certain number at which another tier of another Pokemon slot would have been unlocked at which point you could have put a Pokemon there or I could have already been level 10 at which point no naughty yeah she's already smelled up it was it was in level 4 or 5 I don't have like my highest CP is like 13 90 or something so what I don't have stellar perfect IV pokemon i had what a casual so what you do then is you put something easy in there to make it easy for other what team what trash team are you on mystic mystic Oh gross so it had something easy in there so that other mystics have an easier time training the gym so you just drop like a Caterpie or something well i would i would assume if somebody rolled up with like CP 1600 they would have no problem because i thought they would blast it out of there for sure yeah cuz i think the max that at level 4 that I was seeing was was like 1500 so I was I was a I was a hundred to two hundred below that CP but I was still able to get through it right it nautical nautical strategy fun though like battling it in there in Pokemon go is not enjoyable no it's really not you just tap the screen a bunch time and then occasionally hold it but get in there and put some put some caterpie's on the gyms help out your teammates and then work it but you can't put don't have an easily to put you gotta put the caterpie's and work it up well yeah of course otherwise someone's gonna roll on you leave it for for other people to come in and work it I see can we use different language other than work it yeah you gotta work it girl work it getting give real sweaty in that gym I don't know clanging in bed oh no guys clanging banging in the Pokemon gym yeah yeah uh huh boy bringing this back bill rights in from their pc Sarah sorta Sarasota Sarasota Florida that'd be doing a place hey super effective crew I've

what we'll talk about that next week but thank you Bill Alex rights in from Auckland New Zealand Auckland Auckland yeah that's it that's probably it I Steve I would like to say I'm a huge fan of yours even though i only started listening during your Pokemon Sun and Moon II gameplay and I seem to like it I would like to know that Steve is my favorite and micah is a close second oh wow my favorite pokemon is houndoom and it was my first shiny I would like to know what your first shiny is from Alex in New Zealand take that nerds close second Hey and take that you're a close second well thanks my first shiny is nothing because I have yet to find a shiny in the wild I'll tell you what my first shiny and sun and moon was was that the questioner was it just first shiny ever first shiny ever believe in general yeah you could you do both I remember I think I remember your first shiny and sun and moon my first shiny and sun and moon was a pink hypno and I was very upset it's cool I was really excited to have my first shiny be something that I like actively searched out and i just stumbled on it and it kind of was it like ruined the moment it ruins the like like I'm gonna hunt for a shiny mimic you or something cool that I'm gonna keep and whatever and my first shiny was a hypno I was very disappointed this happened though this happened the same night that Becky was playing my wife for anybody that doesn't know was playing next to me and before i got my shiny hip now she says why is this zoo back green and should i catch it it's amazing well like shiny zoo bats not not like a tier above shiny hypno hate to break it to her I mean they're kind of both on the same plane of interest as far as I'm concerned I attempted to shiny hunt for an execute and I did it for about five hours the whole SOS battle and then I decided it wasn't worth my time anymore and I I quit wow I've never had one go that long he was telling how were you did you get the shiny charm did you have like yeah I think it no shiny Charlie animal that's why it took you five hours five hours for nothing I I went it was the first time you can like encounter execute on i lo and so I was like well I've already killed like 10 of them I guess I'll just keep going it was not enjoyable yeah you gotta you gotta prepare you can't just do it on a whim I'm sure he has never taken me that long I mean I had the the ethers and I had the the lima beans or whatever they're called the lima beans what ordered a lepa berries yeah the love I had I had plenty let the berries lima beans I had the ethers I had the whole one hit KO because i was using my two cannon do you have the orbs i have the orbs yeah i had the orbs yeah I mean it gets it definitely gets easier with a shiny charm look you will yeah but that was as far as me to complete my pokedex and that's not easy come on spin out for what six months now get it together does shiny execute look cool ah shiny shiny executor a little bit Nick cricket or i should say has like red leaves and stuff green leaves oh that's pretty cool yeah so that's what i was trying to go for Travis what about you shiny I think my first shiny would have been what was it gibble that they gave out at one of the VG sees a shiny kimmel something like that doesn't care what I don't know why that's me we'll see eh eh I mean that was I mean to answer the question literally that is the first shiny I obtained the first one that I encountered in the wild however was a shiny Luvdisc that i got from chain fishing in generation 6 and then I've gotten a lot more in gen 7 from doing SOS training and stuff like that I think my favorite is my shiny cutie fly that's a pretty good shiny ah this email is from jose from San Luis Mexico hey guys jose AKA conical from Mexico here with a long email for you I've been listening the show for about a year and I like it a lot i usually listen at my desk in my job and all my co-workers look weird at me whenever I start laughing but I on my own but I can't help it all three of you plus Micah and Irene are great hosts it's always fun to listen to s pjs clung clumsiness what IV tremors are my future Steve that has to edit the huge spike that was that laughs that feasible after with it wells knowledge and Travis's sarcasm and humor keep up the good work my eyes are watering I decided to write in after listening to the whole wet burrito debate as I have a comment on what i believed is based on here in New Mexico we're getting that like raw cold hard facts here we I'm mexico's finest is written in here not cold and hard burritos that sounds gross here in Mexico the state of Jalisco to be precise uh we have a typical dish called the torterra agraja da which is the literal translation of drownded torta torta that consists in a toilet i wish i could see that habit or two yellow r T 0 r T 0 r TN torta that's what I said yeah well I mean that's kind of what you said it's good what is a torta is it just like a like a softshell taco I thought I'm probably way wrong in this but I thought tortas were like sandwiches oh actually it says here in the next sentence that consists in a torta a kind of sandwich made with a different bread called a bolio or Berto a burro brot yeah yes man i wish i knew honey this was spelled i could be able to tell you how to pronounce it but hey i pronounce torture right he has requested me about it i said it right a filled with pork I didn't say anything about your total pronunciation and covered in tomato sauce with some red onion on it and you get to choose how spice you usually want it usually it is eaten when you are hungover and it's very tasty that's pretty much it so now I have questions for you to that are completely non Pokemon that are completely that are not completely pokeman related number one do you miss game Manuel's being physical included with every game I liked I loved reading those and the Pokemon ones were particularly awesome as long as they were long have so many illustrations and notes number two who is your favorite superhero that's it for my email I hope he gets right on the show keep being the best Pokemon podcast out there and we will keep making sure of keeping them dogs clean this 2017 glad to hear it let's do a superhero question question one first because I can tell you right now I don't have a favorite superhero I'm not big on superheroes or comics or anything like that oh I guess I'll I'll go my answer used to be green lantern because I like the idea of a superhero that wasn't just I mean you get this in tons of different superheroes whether you're talking DC or marvel where multiple people have inhabited the same role the same the same name but Green Lantern was always interesting to me that the green lantern for this sector in in space was just like one person out of tons that were assigned to all of the sectors of space i thought that was interesting that like in the cosmic scope of things this person who seems like immensely powerful from our tiny earth perspective is just one of a ton that that are in that green lantern corps i found that idea interesting um and then I actually like red green lantern comics and they're they're boring and really and spend way too much time talking about how different emotions are like different colors and I'm in a lot it was it different what the different like colored rings do and that ended up boring me um I I like I haven't I don't know if I could pick one of them but in terms of like comic series I'm kind of interested in the x-men right now maybe it's just because I really enjoyed Logan so I'm going back and looking at some old x-men stories but I there have been some interesting x-men stories and I think a lot of the characters are have interesting analogues to real life and like real life experiences so that's cool real quick before I answer can I get a hot take and Logan did you like it oh yeah I thought it was really good I think it's laudable for being movie that said that for being a comic book movie that dares to actually say a thing in a world where everyone is falling head over heels over a Deadpool which is a movie that's purely pessimism and deconstruction for the sake of nothingness that even the same studio decided well we can actually maybe say something this time and they did and it's good i'm excited to see it i I that's because I'm also kind of going back and before I see it I guess I want to see some of the source material and I'm going through some House of M stuff that apparently is partially tied to it and then going through some Logan I know I don't really necessary I don't necessarily think you really need to read the source material material it's mostly like the old man Logan stuff that is based on I yes but I mean it's less of a x-men movie and more of just a road picture that happens to have Wolverine and a lot of people's faces being brutally ripped apart by metal claws oh okay yeah I don't really have a favorite superhero either but I have a lot of favorite like story arcs throughout yeah the history of Marvel Comics not so much TC I'm not that big of a I've never really been big into DC comics but um I don't know like the original Civil War ark was really interesting to me and the split sides and lives like unmasking superheroes and big reveals and stuff like that was really cool to me other than that I don't think anybody has ever really like stuck out to me when I was young I really liked gambit because he was a babe other than I don't think of did you watch the x-men cartoon I did yes man lady nee nee nee nee nee nee nee nee nee ah such a good opener frog he's a babe in that too bonini an excuse me steve is dreading editing this right yeah I deem as far away from my microphone it's fine do you miss gay man he was being physically included with every game was the other question from Jose did any of the when did they stop including gay manuals and pokemon games I don't know I bought the last two digitally yeah I did I mean I did too I like bought physical ones button open them they're kind of like just for collection sake but hacen everyone why they were looting manual Jill had a menu whoa no I won't be able to confirm this I because I never have really cared that much about manuals I started playing video games before i could read so the manual was never really that important of i couldn't read the manual so it wasn't ever that an important part has started to care about manuals for collections purpose for collection purposes like collecting complete versions of games and things like that but i guess that i mean i just kind of stopped doing that I guess I didn't realize that they stopped including manuals of a lot of nintendo stuff specifically because i feel like that was still when other companies had dropped off of carrying man you're putting manuals in Game cases Nintendo was still doing that IRA I mean I remember the red and blue manuals and like going through those as a kid several times and how it looked like a little like field guide kind of book that manual just stood out to me and still does stand out to me but for the most part I don't know I I manuals probably for me to do the same effect of art books and like I have destiny art books in final fantasy 14 art books and you know other art books just sitting on a shelf and I think I've maybe page through them once and it was like a quick page 3 of like oh yeah this is good paper quality this art school and then it just collects dust on my shelf and I think for me manuals would do the same acceptance of collecting dust on my shelf it would just remain in the game case yeah I think I mean as far as having the actual manuals I think it's more just like it's nice to have it then it is something out of tangible right more than it has any actual practical use like I'm not I I'm not like lost without a manual you know yeah I don't i think it was much more needed in times where games weren't super clear on how to play certain parts of it like they didn't have hand like like walk walking hand holding tutorials at the beginning of the game and stuff like that next email here is actually some physical mail unfold this here some snail mail as they would say hello Steve Travis and will as well as anyone from the B team who might be present oh it's your lucky day recently Micah suggested that listener should send snail mail s pjs way so I am looking forward to physically passing this envelope to one of you at PAX East Travis is nice level to deliver this to me as it's customary to announce one's favorite host prior to ask you a question I would like to thank my favorite members favorite member of the ISC crew Travis for always bringing such a thoughtful measured perspective to the proceedings at least until will leads them into an argument which usually ends up being my favorite part of the show of any given show a fresh batch of Pokemon merchandise debuted at Toy Fair last month including new and improved Pokemon construction toys from Mega Bloks and the polly pocket inspired line of miniature Pokemon games for girls extreme quotes likewise the pokémon center online shop now offers a premium shadow box containing a set of classic Pokemon badges that would make any trainer on Victory Road blush as well as those handsome new figures that the site rolled out on polk Monday at the height of the Pokemon go crazy I even saw my local shopping mall stocking Pikachu colored mophie iphone charging cases as well as plenty of throwback generation 1 merchandise including adult sized backpacks cookie cutter mold and scarves as Pokemon continues to diversify its already impressive selection of consumer products are there any items you would like to see get the pokemon brand treatment either items which don't yet exist or all product or products which are already offered in limited supply would you like to see expanded thank you for all the hard work you put on each week and always an entertaining show now if you'll excuse me I have a very dirty dog to keep clean in 2017 AC thank you for the snail mail AC was one of the fans we met at pecs and yeah it was great meeting yay see ya very nice guy we have you kids out there keep sending in that snail mail I love the snail mail I felt good to read some snail mail ah so the the question was merchandise you'd want to see or expanded upon or anything like that well real quick I'd like to see more mimic you plushies because I recently went to find them outside of Pokemon Center calm because they haven't restocked and they're on ebay for like eighty dollars so you're saying I should sell my plush yes i'll sell it to you for 70 how's that well I'm out not not interested in dollars less than ebay it's a deal of the century right there that I mean you're not wrong but don't don't do this to me I'm real desperate for a mimic you plush and I can't be I can't be spending seventy dollars on plush I'm trying to think of what I would want to see there's a lot of pokemon stuff i have my house I've Pokemon blankets Pokemon pillows plushies I would really really like to see a resurgence in the like Pikachu pal I don't remember what they were called the like basically the Pikachu tomica rocket pikachu yes i'd like to see a recent are incredible in those pocket Pikachu's Tamagotchis giga pets whatever I want to see that come back around I can subscribe to this you know what I want to see actually I want decent Pokemon hoodies not the ones they sell on Pokemon Center that are that are 60 to 70 dollars because that is a ridiculous price for a hoodie you could get a plush for that you can mimic you plush for that i'm selling one right now 70 bucks but they're also what is called like the quote unquote classic fit and i'm not i'm done buying classic fit stuff i need that slim fit stuff in my life whether that's a t-shirt or a hoodie I just want things that fit a little tighter to my body and classic fit doesn't fit the bill so I want I want more more of that I want like a good hoodie that I can that I can drown myself in tailored hoodies yeah then the painless I'm also gonna say clothing because I'm not I'm not much of a stuff person I don't I don't do a lot like if I get a blush it just kind of sits there I don't do a lot with things but clothes I don't have to have anyway so I mean I had the pocket pikachu too if that is what I was calling this what it was called and it was an incredible device that I spent a lot of time on playing I spent a lot of time playing the double or nothing game that was in there where you would bet wats whether or no I guess it was sort of double or nothing but you would bet wats Double or Nothing whether or not the next card Pikachu would draw from a deck of playing cards would be higher or lower than the previous one you remember a lot of time on that is if that were actually a fun game yeah it's not fun i remember it again but yeah i bet those wats you remember way more about this than I do well there was there is there's a lot of time with it there's pocket p and retelling it is making me even more excited for new ones well there was pocket you which was the the yellow one and then it was pocket I did not have I only had pocket pikachu too yeah there's pocket Pikachu to which worked with the infrared scanner on the game boy color and I had the GS logo yes for going someone yeah I so yeah I would also go in more clothing cuz I wouldn't do anything with a vanilluxe plushie but I'd where'd a phenolic skirt or something you know like I like because I'm gonna have to wear clothes anyway I'm not gonna have to have a blushy with me anyway I'm bad at buying things for myself that I don't need yeah I don't know so yeah and so I can even though i don't need more clothes i can at least justify i can justify the purchase of clothing to myself yeah i mean you could just carry a plush with you every way yeah i was putting bag just pull it out when we be a good look a lot of the stuff on pokemon center com like it's fine and i would probably buy it if it was more tailored to pokemon i like where's like there's no like lotad pin right but i would probably buy a lotad pin and for ya i could maybe see pins my issue with clothing is that like I just don't and Steve knows this better than Travis's but I don't wear things with like graphic stuff on him really eager house really i just never wear clothes I mean I work from home so that's actually pretty true haha uh what I am wearing clothes usually it's I mean I don't wear things that are like really branded I like graphic tees really don't do it for me that much so look having new graphic tees never really excites me it's got to really be something that that is like unique or piques my interest but I don't think I've ever looked at pokemon center com at anything clothing and been like yeah I could wear that well then yeah I guess I should say it has to be like cool and good that's the thing about me and like graphic tees is because I always have a hoodie on so 0 people ever see what is under that hoodie yeah i'm like like i love that Pokemon Center is like still putting out stuff but there's a certain point where you're just like I have no room for these plushies I only have one plush I feel terrible for not having more pleasures or maybe that's good I don't know yeah I think I think we're in reality it's good but if you want to make you posh uni I got one Steven rights in revenue dollars from Alaska my favorite host is travis they are awesome they are an awesome meme Lord also if you guys could fuse to put together who would they be as the ho who would they be hope to hear on here this on the show have a fantastic day Stephen if I could fuse two Pokemon it would be Travis and will create a singularity haha two points funny cuz that's the thing we said before I would today probably I think I mean this has kind of already been done by a lot of people right because there is that meme that I think is really cool speaking of meme Lord my me milord status there's that thing going on those really cool where artist would draw alternate versions of a Pokemon species based on the other Pokemon in its AG group so they would look through like what pokemon that Pokemon could theoretically breed with and then draw depictions of what it would actually look like to have a crossbreed between those two Pokemon artists have been really cool stuff with that and upset that I can't think of anything talking about that' that site where it would like no I'm not talking about them I'm not talking about the joke site Garbutt I mean that thing was very funny and cuz that's what I take screenshot though is that yeah yeah like really good art based off of those people definitely did that and that was really cool and really funny but no i'm talking about it was older than that there is a thing where so like for instance uh let me just pick up a random pokemon so i can give hope a good example yeah sure let me pull up vulpix and see what breeding group it's in so vulpix is in the field AG group so for instance it could breed with a Meowth primate growlithe other pokemon in that group so then the artist would make sketches of the what they would envision a crossbreed between those species would look like if it were like real life where it you know don't keep plus horse makes a mule instead of in pokemon where it just looks identical to whatever the mother is mud brand some pretty cool things with that mmm good job did it uh i guess i would probably want to combine like Sableye with something and ink stabilized really cool so and it may be like you know what Saban a Sableye vanilluxe it's in my mind so let's just do it I feel like you could get away with combining a lot of pokemon with rapidash just because you would have that flame main going on just because rabadash is like really boring and it acts for a really good blank slate about you gonna slap anything else on got him so I would say like rapidash and like Gollum cuz then you would have like a ball of fire like a meteor an asteroid that is cool I'll give you that much I don't know name it name your two favorite Pokemon I mean currently may be queuing gengar so I don't really know what I mean you would have like a mini q really anger alkylation even more ghostly poison even ghosts fairy Tommy Wright's in from Columbus dear IC crew and fan base I am NOT a plant I just like Travis's and djs podcast love Tommy wow I think I might have been like two weeks old but yeah I mean a few weeks ago the person wrote in with an email just saying how good my other podcast arbitrary archive is and I don't necessarily agree i don't think it's that great and then come tommy was accused of being a plant or some sort of shill for the arbitrary archive what are we talking about last week on the show it was um yeah i remember it was good i remember we did a week ago uh uh would you like two more emails here Tyler Wright said hi guys my name is pig menq must be like a twitter / username and I've been listening to you guys for the past year and loving it I was wondering what your guys's favorite episode you've ever done is also my favorite person is SBJ and we'll as we are the same person but when will there be a new mythical hmm so we got like two questions here first one is favorite episode you've done there's their show that stands out to you too I mean is this include mythical because there's a lot of mythical stuff that we've done that I really liked yeah I suppose I could that could extend a mythical then something mythical I can't I don't think I can say it talk about it so that's something I love whenever mythical comes up at from an email writer then everyone bought SBJ just gets a little passive-aggressive about the things that were upset that we're not allowed to talk about yet when mythical and we're like well my favorite thing is the thing that Steve won't let me talk about I mean you you you could say that's your favorite Micah but have you recently like no I got no I guess i guess like that it could be a terrible like as somebody who edits podcast there's I don't know if Travis can relate to that or anyone else but there's that feeling of like when you're going through a podcast you're like yeah this sounds like it's gonna be really good and then when you get when you let it sit for an hour and then you go to edit it and you're going through and you're like I guess this wasn't as funny as i thought it was this like an hour ago I know what you're talking about and I hope you're cutting out like ninety percent of the first like our of that because it's just rolling dice but but in general though like that that that feeling does exist i doona ya like it like even when I finished interviews during the interview could be like yeah this is going great and then you listen to it afterwards and you're like why did I ask such a dumb question I yeah I think a lot of it has to do with that experience it for me is at least like I think I'm saying something really cool or funny and in the moment and then I realized later as i'm editing whatever i'm doing that the joke was like way too in my head or I didn't explain a thing right or I misspoke and that's just generally it's always usually my fault and the realization is like immediately after I say it just like in my normal life i guess i don't know i mean i guess i really liked mostly because of the actual experience that was tied with it but the genka the mythical gencon special was really fun oh yeah yeah that was good recording it and being in the room you know all the excitement surrounding gencon that was good ah probably the fit my favorite thing that I've been on I have a couple episodes I like a lot I really liked the episode with Xavier woods that was also the week that like Pokemon go launch so I just feel like that episode had so much excitement from start to finish and they're like pee back off like what mica said like that episode has just so many like vivid memories for me of like recording it and like I remember the Pokemon go stuff and I remember the look traveling to meet Xavier and I remember like being in his house and recording and then like playing pokemon go for the first time in Atlanta with my friend Alex like that was such a like that whole episode is just very reminiscent of that time for me and then I think another episode that i really liked a lot was the kickstarter episode that we did shout out to alex nasty boys 2017 yeah i think the kickstarter episode was really good i went into that oh episode episode really hoping that there would be debate and frustration as weird as that sounds and there was and i think it was good and it panned out I mean like and went argued for four hours yeah yeah and and that's kind of what I wanted but I pas this podcast would be really boring if all three of us agreed on everything together right so if we were at Kickstarter if we went into that Kickstarter episode all being like okay like sure I get you put me out on why not and instead of like not like instead of instead we talked about that and that got heated at some points and then I think that really translated well to the audience and they responded in in terms and they were very upset about the list too because when it comes down to it everyone has their favorite Pokemon so it was going to be impossible for us to not make a top ten list without people feeling like they got shafted in some way can you do that one we could just have a one-off where the stipulation that you all have to agree on everything you're talking enough that a pan out for being interesting it's hard for me to be able to think of any episode that was cooler to do then the PAX East panel we'd just did I joked the week after about how nervous I was and I certainly was but being able to do our ridiculous jokes about you know like answering the question the ridiculous questions about duck-sized horses and all that and such in front of 100 people I I don't know it was really fun it's cool to be able to hear that you know hear people laugh instantaneously as opposed to wake waiting like two days and then having someone say on twitter that they liked my joke so yeah it was a lot of fun to do that even though I it's already been established that I didn't really like pax itself it took me about a week to listen to that episode I finally last week listen to it and that the energy of the episode was so good Thank very like live episode well paced thanks Lee a live episodes don't really pan out well I think it's like when people download it they realize it's live and I'm guilty of this too for some of the podcast I was into it's just like I don't like the way this audio sounds and so live episodes don't get as many downloads as normal episodes but I am trying to come up with different solutions to make live episodes sound as normal as possible to real episodes we could do is just craft a room that you bring in that's just windows and everybody can watch you from the outside bell and said well that's what the PlayStation view is yeah yeah yeah you take delicious it's a PlayStation podcast that's only live and you not watch them and you can't hear them you're just viewing them fewer we get this question a lot when the middle of a new mythical content all I'm going to say this episode is watch our Twitter at pokemon podcast and there might be something there that gives you an answer and that will probably be every day until that answer is revealed so it's pretty obvious if you follow us on twitter but i would i would stay tuned to watch that and final question will do for the day even though we have a bunch here is from Carla from Brooklyn New York hey Pokemon casters thank you for providing such a quality show week after week I figured out you and other listeners might have some good feedback to the simple question what do you think is the best way to organize a living pokedex my national dex through pokemon bank is almost complete I am only missing dancing and volcanium but it's hard to figure out which Pokemon i still need especially when pc boxes are so cramped pokemon bank does not have that space issue but it also doesn't have an easy way to search for specific Pokemon making it harder to organize I'm sure there's a simple solution but it is annoying when I am just finally when I'm just trying to finally complete a living decks for almost two decades of playing the main game thanks for reading especially if you read on the podcast and I think everyone is great but if I have to pick my favorite it might be Irene thanks again Carla I think by color is the obvious i just recently did this and i can give you some tinder i organized national dex are living i have started my national dex and i have a good chunk of it okay uh what i did was i pulled up a list of all of the pokémon for by number in the national dex and I I grabbed my little journal and I wrote all of them which took a really long time sorry why did you just print the list cuz it's not i don't i don't know way all right you're talking every pokemon i did and i draw a line through them in my journal I keep my journal in my DS with me wherever I'm going or it did when i was still actively doing this and i would draw a line through them as I finished them but in the pokemon bank what I did was the first thing i did was i labeled all of the boxes 0 to 6 30 and 31 to 60 at whatever and then so i think the point of confusion here is micah when you say you're gonna give a tip usually you're supposed to be giving good idea it's the best idea it's the only way that if you're the idea of losing the name of the boxes then boxes to the different numbers is actually a good idea yeah that's the easiest way the Writing Center was not extra like no it's really gonna list brother I did it because I like doing it control p on PC commands he on Mac I don't feel accomplished when I do that boo listen I got a journal for a reason okay I want that I want that achievement in my journal it's such a good feeling to just like with a sit down right over a dress ok my name is slide through a name with ease and try right move it for the list scratch everything mica said really though naming your boxes is the best way to do arranged pokemon x color and call it a day or that i agree where's all my blue pokémon these are the garbage way yeah i think actually naming boxes the numbers is a really smart way I have like my boxes are such a mess in bank I have a box of all like event Pokemon which is already full and now i need to make another box of event pokemon and then i have a box of pokemon given to me for competition so when i played black and white competitively i had a bunch of nice folks make me Ivy EV perfect Pokemon so I have them in a separate box like oh these are competition right you really at any time I guess unless the meta changes but I never I didn't have metal Pokemon to begin with and then I have a box of and then I have like a box of a bunch of v's and then I have a box lunch did oohs and then everything else is a mess after that so we're joe game 0 organizing pokemon x color but have you heard of monochromatic tournaments like where you only battle with green pokemon yeah so there's a the all pokemon are actually given a pokedex an official color in the pokédex and like I still have the vole pex page open from when we're using that as an example earlier and vulpix is officially brown and so sometimes people have made just little for fun tournaments where you can choose any color you want but all of the pokemon in it need to have be officially labeled in the pokédex as being the same color at least interesting things were like some colors are better like you like some colors are better suited for different strategies than others just based on what pokemon are purple or whatever so that's something like one yeah we should be really one ascetically pleasing yeah yeah it sounds like a you know magic the gathering a little bit you pick your color and many tap you did you chat had Pokemon thanks for the email hopefully the the Box advice helps you a little bit write a journal just write all the pokemon down look you exercise it feels good trust me on this it's it's like a meditative experience if you

if you can't sign up if you can't spare a dollar a month support us that's fine don't worry about it it's really not the end of the world but thank you to everyone who does support us speaking of support Travis support us through our pokemon of the week ah man I thought you were like actually gonna do this I was gonna be really impressed by your transition because I thought you're gonna be like support because they're poking on the week is hunched crow and it can learn tailwind which is support move you're like gonna know the things i forgot what second water pokemon of the week was condos Association and actually we get us a mission for both haunch crow and murkrow because as Brandon weisner points out in the Pokemon of the week slack channel neither of these Pokemon are really getting a lot of use but murkrow actually it's marginally more use than does ponch probe because murkrow loses the prankster ability when it volves evolves into hunch crow and prankster is an incredibly powerful ability so these two sets are going to be pretty wildly different from each other because they're doing quite different things so first we'll do the haunch crow set because that is officially the program the week this comes to us from Kevin Soria give me an adamant nature with 250 2 v's and attack and speed for nhp with life orb and moxie the moves are the moves are foul play he's very difficult to transition from our to foul blue anyway the moves our foul play tailwind brave bird and sucker punch Kevin also recommends instead of tailwind you could also run roost or protect kevin says it's pretty basic it's a pretty basic sweeper for the most part you might consider using fly MZ for the item so that you can get the flying z move and then mentions that a tailwind weather set up by the hajj crow itself or by another Pokemon if you're not running tail and on it I would help punch crow a lot this the speed is the thing that's sort of lacking with hunch crow has decent attack stat so it can deal a lot of damage but a quick look at that don't do that this is speed status kind of hindering it before we move on to the murkrow sad I want to throw something out there that's not necessarily good but I thought it was fun when I was messing around with it so a lowland marowak is not as dominant as it was when the people were first messing around with the format I think it's like I'm not sure if it's even in the top ten most used Pokemon right now but there's a point where it definitely was and it was everywhere and I had a I was just messing around with different pokemon and had a sort of gimmicky admittedly team and one of the holes that it it had a hard time dealing with a low and marowak and I wanted something that could just guarantee out speed it and kill it in one hit and strangely enough the the one I decided to try out was was haunch crow with a with the ability super luck and a scope lens because then if you use super Lux Copeland's and night / all three of those so night / has an increased priority scope lens increases the likelihood of critical hits by one or sorry night / has increased critical hit ratio I said increased priority it has increased critical hit ratio scope lens increases the critical hit ratio of all your moves by one and super luck increases the critical hit ratio of all your moves by one so that means night / ends up being a guaranteed critical hit which ended up being a guaranteed one at ko on most of the EV spreads that people were using for marowak it's really gimmicky but it was really fun and it also has the side benefit of you know that having a critical hit is not just good because it gives you more damage but it can also shoot through people who like set up defense increases and stuff like that I should reiterate it wasn't good but it's a funny thing that you can do and then people on pokemon showdown get really angry at you because how did you get three critical hits in a row then you have to explain to them that you did this really inadvisable thing that makes it a one hundred percent chance to do that anyway our last set is going to be for murkrow from brandon weisner this is going to be murkrow with EVO light AV light as an item that increases the defense of special defense of a Pokemon that has the capability to evolve so murkrow account for this the ability as I mentioned before is prankster that's an ability that causes moves that don't deal damage to have increased priority so that they are more likely to go first your EV spread is going to be 252 in HP under 48 and defense and 108 in special defense with a careful nature this is as you can gather from the EV spread and the ability this is more a support oriented set and moves are going to be tailwind foul play squash and taunt taunt and tail wind on are in there because they're just incredible support moves taught for shutting down other Pokemon that are dealing nondamaging moves and then tail went to increase the speed of your team temporarily quash is a really interesting move that you're really you might not know if you don't play a lot of doubles and even then it's it's really only seen on these sort of marginally used like murkrow sets so quash is a dark-type move that makes it so that the target will move last this turn ignoring all like priority so as long as it has enacted already so the reason quash doesn't really see use generally is because if whatever is using a move is going to be faster than you anyway then quash has no effect but because murkuro has prankster you're going to go first with quash unless they use a move with increased priority as well and you can force a Pokemon to move last and then hopefully kill that Pokemon before it's even able to get that move off so you can make a Pokemon that would normally be really fast and be able to KO one in your Pokemon actually the slowest Pokemon in the round and take it out before it's able to act and that can be really cool and then foul play is in there because sometimes you need your support Pokemon to deal damage and foul play is a way to do that without having to invest any in attack because foul play determines its damage by the targets taxed at instead of your own no I think that's that's it yeah well that make sense yes it did your shiny hunch crow will be a bright and pink and that's a really good shine it's really good shiny instead of like the dark blue that it normally is some trivia here ponch crows English name used to be a Japanese word origin word in its name honcho delivered from honcho hard to say that because it's like they're literally the same words while the Japanese name uses the western origin word in its name Don is delivered from the Italian Don or Latin for dominant Adamas both our leader like names and used some and sometimes are used for leaders of shady organizations conch crow comes after mismagius in the sinnoh pokedex but honch crows pre evolution murkrow comes before mismagius is pre evolution misdreavus in the Johto pokedex there you go Hotch Crow is based on a crow or raven with its bulkier more powerful appearance hounds crow looks more much more like a raven than its pre evolution does but its coloration resembles that Ivy hooded crow while murkrow appears to be based on witches of Western folklore haunch crows appearance is reminiscent of a crime boss given a new interpretation to murkrow as a game gang member under hunch crow its crest looks like a wide brimmed fedora hat an article clothing often associated with mom mobsters or neck beards however hansgrohe still actually save it to Justin Hodge gross till does represent fesem broom which has a long connect who has been long connected with witchcraft and its hat and beard like feathers also give the impersonation impression of a sorcerer or wizard people that have listened to the Kickstarter episode know that I really love haunch crow that makes me really nostalgic for playing pokemon with my brother and rolling with the hunch that's so cool ponch grows so cool the big boss Pokemon is hungry Idol that's so cool and good big boss is really good well I think think that wraps
