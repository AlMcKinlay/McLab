creators (1:51 - 1:55)
who are excited that pokemon unite is (1:52 - 1:56)
presenting you with (1:55 - 2:00)
new exciting content (1:56 - 2:04)
okay point one little pup is not a fox (2:00 - 2:08)
it is a dog as stated by the name (2:04 - 2:10)
lollipop (2:08 - 2:15)
it's buffalont not bufflant (2:10 - 2:18)
three it's looty colo (2:15 - 2:21)
not ludicolo (2:18 - 2:25)
i wish i was making that up and four (2:21 - 2:28)
it's cinderache not cinderease who have (2:25 - 2:29)
you been watching who are you i'm (2:28 - 2:31)
watching this putting out this garbage (2:29 - 2:32)
content (2:31 - 2:34)
the about so i went and i was like okay (2:32 - 2:36)
i want to like see what other people are (2:34 - 2:36)
doing (2:36 - 2:38)
and see how they're playing the game and (2:36 - 2:41)
one person the entire time kept saying (2:38 - 2:46)
ludicolo and i was so distracted (2:41 - 2:49)
by this pronunciation that i could not (2:46 - 2:51)
continue with the video (2:49 - 2:53)
and i had to go back and make i was like (2:51 - 2:55)
okay you can't that had to have been a (2:53 - 2:56)
joke but it kept (2:55 - 3:00)
happening and there was no like ha ha it (2:56 - 3:01)
was just (3:00 - 3:05)
so then you'll attack ludicolo (3:01 - 3:06)
you don't need to watch any of these (3:05 - 3:08)
youtube videos i'm putting out (3:06 - 3:11)
very helpful guides that save people 10 (3:08 - 3:12)
minutes of their time (3:11 - 3:15)
look i am not psaying to you (3:12 - 3:17)
i am psaying to the people who are (3:15 - 3:22)
trying to make content for pokemon folks (3:17 - 3:24)
pronunciations are indeed difficult but (3:22 - 3:25)
you can (3:24 - 3:29)
find them it is never ludicolo (3:25 - 3:31)
the lilly pup is a fox really throws me (3:29 - 3:33)
off i did you because it's like a kiss (3:31 - 3:34)
the guy's like okay so you want to kill (3:33 - 3:36)
this fox thing first (3:34 - 3:39)
and i'm like what fox thing and then (3:36 - 3:41)
they're chasing lily pup (3:39 - 3:44)
and i'm like but it says pup in the name (3:41 - 3:47)
i mean they asked (3:44 - 3:47)
look it's been a wild weekend of content (3:48 - 3:56)
i'm veteran three i had an (3:52 - 3:59)
incredible night on unite last night i'm (3:56 - 4:00)
flying high but (3:59 - 4:02)
i'm doing everybody else a favor learn (4:00 - 4:04)
learn how to say pokemon names (4:02 - 4:09)
please it's you go a palm or ipom (4:04 - 4:09)
a pum apam who's saying ipom (4:10 - 4:16)
well who's saying ludicolo but here we (4:13 - 4:18)
are (4:16 - 4:18)
i hate this timeline (4:18 - 4:22)
i mean okay um in there you could (4:23 - 4:28)
say (4:26 - 4:28)
no because there's there's a p and then (4:30 - 4:35)
the o is right there so it technically (4:34 - 4:38)
could make the i long so a i up (4:35 - 4:41)
all right before we start talking about (4:38 - 4:42)
unite (4:41 - 4:44)
or pokemon go uh let's talk about (4:42 - 4:45)
pokemon snap (4:44 - 4:48)
that'll be our first bit of news here (4:45 - 4:49)
nintendo live sent in by alex from our (4:48 - 4:50)
slack community (4:49 - 4:53)
this week's new pokemon snap update also (4:50 - 4:57)
includes quality of life improvements (4:53 - 5:01)
um here here are the improvements (4:57 - 5:03)
now when you go to retry a level after (5:01 - 5:05)
completion you will (5:03 - 5:08)
get to select the research level again (5:05 - 5:10)
so you don't have to exit in order to (5:08 - 5:10)
select (5:10 - 5:12)
the same stage at a different research (5:10 - 5:14)
level you now have the ability to go (5:12 - 5:15)
directly (5:14 - 5:17)
to camp without having any photos (5:15 - 5:19)
assessed (5:17 - 5:22)
if you achieve a len talk mission on one (5:19 - 5:23)
of your photos it will get flagged (5:22 - 5:25)
as meeting the requirements before you (5:23 - 5:27)
get it assessed (5:25 - 5:29)
you can now directly save your images to (5:27 - 5:30)
the nintendo switch (5:29 - 5:33)
you can now save images on your nintendo (5:30 - 5:35)
switch directly from the photo editing (5:33 - 5:38)
option oh the len talk mission is (5:35 - 5:40)
the thing that i think yeah that's like (5:38 - 5:41)
the big one that's like the big one (5:40 - 5:44)
that's a big one that's a goodie (5:41 - 5:46)
too bad i've not played that game did (5:44 - 5:47)
you not play the update (5:46 - 5:49)
no i watched you i told you i was gonna (5:47 - 5:51)
watch you play it so i could see (5:49 - 5:53)
if the one pokemon that i want is in the (5:51 - 5:54)
game it wasn't (5:53 - 5:56)
and therefore it was a trash update and (5:54 - 5:58)
i refused to do it besides (5:56 - 6:02)
unite came out and i'm uh a pro circuit (5:58 - 6:04)
player so i have to put in my unite (6:02 - 6:06)
hours all the pros are master like (6:04 - 6:10)
two weeks ago nah (6:06 - 6:10)
they're out there doing whatever they're (6:10 - 6:14)
doing those are the fake pros that are (6:12 - 6:16)
gonna leave the game in a week (6:14 - 6:18)
not the hardcore long time pros the ones (6:16 - 6:20)
that worked for it (6:18 - 6:23)
i didn't pay to win steve i didn't pay (6:20 - 6:25)
to win i'm doing it the old-fashioned (6:23 - 6:28)
way i'm earning it (6:25 - 6:28)
i put about three to four hours into the (6:30 - 6:34)
snap update (6:33 - 6:38)
um i ended up finding like 12 or 13 of (6:34 - 6:40)
the 20 pokemon they added (6:38 - 6:42)
uh there's three levels there each level (6:40 - 6:44)
has a day and night (6:42 - 6:47)
i did all of them all six (6:44 - 6:51)
i guess um they are (6:47 - 6:55)
new levels except (6:51 - 6:58)
the first one which is like you (6:55 - 7:01)
have to go into the park find the tree (6:58 - 7:05)
scan the tree it then opens the level (7:01 - 7:07)
it reminds me of the electrode situation (7:05 - 7:09)
in the first pokemon snap where you have (7:07 - 7:10)
to like (7:09 - 7:14)
hit the electrode to open the path (7:10 - 7:14)
and then when you're go so that (7:14 - 7:19)
so in order to open that level you have (7:17 - 7:21)
to like go into a level and do it the (7:19 - 7:22)
other two levels are just (7:21 - 7:25)
click on these levels and start and then (7:22 - 7:27)
when you're done with that level (7:25 - 7:29)
the first level that you go into the (7:27 - 7:30)
park find the tree (7:29 - 7:33)
do the level then it poops you back out (7:30 - 7:35)
into park (7:33 - 7:40)
and you're in the floor just field (7:35 - 7:40)
yeah yeah no that is accurate and then (7:42 - 7:47)
i would say that that's what happened (7:45 - 7:48)
and then when you open when you open (7:47 - 7:50)
that list so when you do that level the (7:48 - 7:50)
first time (7:50 - 7:53)
then you can select it separately unlike (7:50 - 7:54)
the other two levels where you can just (7:53 - 7:55)
do it (7:54 - 7:58)
but when you do the level separately (7:55 - 8:00)
and this is the level that shrinks you (7:58 - 8:02)
down this is the only zone that shrinks (8:00 - 8:04)
you down there's a snorlax and (8:02 - 8:08)
you ride in a mulga and stuff when (8:04 - 8:11)
it ends it then poops you back out into (8:08 - 8:11)
the (8:11 - 8:13)
park again and you're in the buffal ant (8:11 - 8:16)
field can we can we use a different term (8:13 - 8:19)
when you exit when you exit when you (8:16 - 8:21)
exit forcibly (8:19 - 8:23)
from the digestive system that was a (8:21 - 8:25)
little weird (8:23 - 8:28)
um i'm not sure why (8:25 - 8:31)
that is it's it's like whatever (8:28 - 8:33)
it's just weird that one of the three (8:31 - 8:35)
you have to go into a level to unlock (8:33 - 8:37)
but it also uses the old level where the (8:35 - 8:38)
other two (8:37 - 8:40)
because i can't think of another there's (8:38 - 8:42)
not out of what the (8:40 - 8:45)
14 15 maps nothing really does that (8:42 - 8:49)
we live in a world of chaos it's just an (8:45 - 8:50)
artifact of (8:49 - 8:52)
the way that this universe was built it (8:50 - 8:54)
was a design choice (8:52 - 8:55)
and they made the choice and we live (8:54 - 8:57)
with the choice yeah i (8:55 - 9:00)
i did like the finding the tree it took (8:57 - 9:02)
me like two passes in the park to figure (9:00 - 9:04)
out which tree it was (9:02 - 9:07)
i mean does it not question mark it does (9:04 - 9:09)
but if you're if you're like (9:07 - 9:10)
you know if you're in your lens and (9:09 - 9:12)
you're snapping pictures of ducklit you (9:10 - 9:14)
miss it (9:12 - 9:14)
sometimes you gotta get some good (9:15 - 9:17)
pictures of duckling i don't know (9:16 - 9:18)
there's i mean i've (9:17 - 9:21)
i thought four four star or four (9:18 - 9:25)
gold platinum pictures i mean i do but (9:21 - 9:28)
ducklit is douglas (9:25 - 9:29)
i mean i i did see the part where they (9:28 - 9:32)
doubled down on beethoven (9:29 - 9:36)
they did yeah hardcore double down (9:32 - 9:39)
um so all three of these levels are (9:36 - 9:42)
how do i describe this to me they're (9:39 - 9:45)
they're incredibly short (9:42 - 9:48)
they're not very long and (9:45 - 9:52)
they seem to be set up (9:48 - 9:55)
to be harder (9:52 - 9:55)
like i would wear difficulty level yeah (9:56 - 10:00)
i went through the (9:58 - 10:02)
the mountain one that that has like (10:00 - 10:06)
crustal and rock rough and tepig (10:02 - 10:09)
and there's (10:06 - 10:12)
um one of like the first puzzles (10:09 - 10:15)
is you can have a diglett knock a rock (10:12 - 10:16)
off into a (10:15 - 10:19)
geyser hole there's two geysers and i (10:16 - 10:20)
still (10:19 - 10:21)
i did it like six times i don't know (10:20 - 10:23)
what it does (10:21 - 10:25)
nothing happens when the diglett like (10:23 - 10:26)
besides the rock falling in the (10:25 - 10:30)
geyser like there i did no and did no (10:26 - 10:33)
rock i did no diglett (10:30 - 10:35)
and of course to anyone listening yes i (10:33 - 10:37)
could go to serbia and i could look up (10:35 - 10:39)
exactly what it does (10:37 - 10:43)
but i think the joy for me and snap is (10:39 - 10:43)
i've (10:43 - 10:45)
i've never looked up sereby for anything (10:43 - 10:47)
i have no clue (10:45 - 10:50)
like the 80 plus hours i played i think (10:47 - 10:51)
there's only three pokemon or four (10:50 - 10:52)
pokemon where i'm like (10:51 - 10:54)
okay twitch chat just tell me how to do (10:52 - 10:57)
it because i i can't figure it out (10:54 - 11:00)
so that has been like a real joy for me (10:57 - 11:03)
and i'm thinking like (11:00 - 11:03)
for a person who wants that sense of (11:03 - 11:08)
discovery like the first pokemon snap (11:04 - 11:08)
i don't i don't know what to do then in (11:10 - 11:14)
the desert (11:13 - 11:16)
the second thing is there's like a sand (11:14 - 11:18)
waterfall (11:16 - 11:19)
and it says oh there's a sweet scent (11:18 - 11:22)
coming from this i've thrown apples i (11:19 - 11:23)
played music i don't know what to do (11:22 - 11:24)
there either (11:23 - 11:27)
and then there's a swamp area where (11:24 - 11:30)
scolapede is (11:27 - 11:31)
and there's a lot of stuff happening (11:30 - 11:33)
there i haven't triggered anything (11:31 - 11:37)
in that zone and then there's like one (11:33 - 11:39)
more final area (11:37 - 11:41)
where there's a bunch of holes in the (11:39 - 11:43)
wall and like onyx will peek out (11:41 - 11:45)
and i'm not sure what to do there either (11:43 - 11:47)
and that's kind of like the whole map (11:45 - 11:50)
there's like four specific areas so it's (11:47 - 11:51)
a short map (11:50 - 11:53)
but it just feels like the things you (11:51 - 11:54)
need to do (11:53 - 11:58)
to get pokemon to appear (11:54 - 12:00)
just seem more difficult and we've (11:58 - 12:02)
talked about this before i have like how (12:00 - 12:04)
greg needed to get all the menuers (12:02 - 12:05)
i haven't even done that part yet i know (12:04 - 12:06)
i know that you have to get all the (12:05 - 12:08)
menus together and you have to like find (12:06 - 12:11)
them as you go and that's like a tougher (12:08 - 12:12)
challenge and there's a kangaskhan in (12:11 - 12:14)
that same level with the mini ear where (12:12 - 12:15)
it's like (12:14 - 12:17)
okay i know kangaskhan does something (12:15 - 12:18)
but i don't know what to do to get it to (12:17 - 12:20)
do something (12:18 - 12:22)
so i love that i love that the game has (12:20 - 12:23)
so much (12:22 - 12:26)
little details and the trial and error (12:23 - 12:29)
eventually pay off (12:26 - 12:29)
but i feel like the dlc is good because (12:31 - 12:36)
it's free (12:35 - 12:39)
yeah but then it it it gave me like this (12:36 - 12:39)
rush of (12:39 - 12:42)
frustration almost instantly because (12:39 - 12:45)
when i went when i went through the park (12:42 - 12:47)
and i took all these pictures all of (12:45 - 12:48)
them were gar (12:47 - 12:51)
they were all bad like it's like because (12:48 - 12:52)
i've put so much (12:51 - 12:55)
time into it to spend three four or five (12:52 - 12:57)
minutes on a course (12:55 - 13:00)
and then just know that maybe only one (12:57 - 13:03)
picture will be good (13:00 - 13:05)
it's just like oh okay like what's the (13:03 - 13:07)
point keep trying (13:05 - 13:08)
i'm not getting a better molga at this (13:07 - 13:10)
point i'm not getting a better pikachu (13:08 - 13:12)
at this point it's just like (13:10 - 13:14)
we'll see that save your film for the (13:12 - 13:16)
tree (13:14 - 13:16)
well when you go to the tree you have so (13:16 - 13:21)
many old pokemon there (13:18 - 13:23)
so you're snapping pictures of those (13:21 - 13:25)
like when you when you're in the tree (13:23 - 13:27)
like there's b doof and there's dodrio (13:25 - 13:28)
and there's a moga (13:27 - 13:32)
like these are new pokemon like there's (13:28 - 13:35)
um so it's more for the enthusiast than (13:32 - 13:39)
for the collector i think it is designed (13:35 - 13:41)
for more (13:39 - 13:45)
like hardcore snap players that want to (13:41 - 13:47)
try to figure out those little puzzles (13:45 - 13:49)
but i would imagine if you just go to (13:47 - 13:50)
serbian you look it up because (13:49 - 13:52)
like most of the pokemon of the 20 you (13:50 - 13:54)
don't have to do anything special for (13:52 - 13:55)
you don't have to do anything special (13:54 - 13:57)
for crustal or tepe or rakra for (13:55 - 14:01)
snorlax they're literally right there (13:57 - 14:02)
so i'd imagine if you go to serbia and (14:01 - 14:04)
we're like okay how do i activate (14:02 - 14:06)
gyarados which i heard gyarados is very (14:04 - 14:06)
hard to (14:06 - 14:10)
pop out like you're kind of just (14:06 - 14:12)
like looking at the back of the book for (14:10 - 14:13)
the answers to the crossword puzzle and (14:12 - 14:15)
then like flipping back and filling them (14:13 - 14:16)
in right (14:15 - 14:19)
like it is a puzzle game and the joy is (14:16 - 14:22)
discovering the puzzle (14:19 - 14:22)
and i think the courses are cool they're (14:22 - 14:27)
just really short (14:24 - 14:27)
i mean yeah there's a dlc dude no i'm (14:27 - 14:32)
not saying it's bad i'm just explaining (14:30 - 14:35)
my thought process going through (14:32 - 14:38)
uh and i'm (14:35 - 14:41)
i can definitely see why people fall off (14:38 - 14:43)
pokemon snap because yeah it is (14:41 - 14:45)

pokemon in the new pokemon snap dlc (17:30 - 17:36)
like 30 minutes after it comes out (17:32 - 17:37)
like i kind of figured there was gonna (17:36 - 17:39)
i'm gonna say legendary slash mythical (17:37 - 17:40)
because i don't want to give away what (17:39 - 17:42)
it is (17:40 - 17:43)
but out of the 20 pokemon there's a (17:42 - 17:45)
legendary slash mythical (17:43 - 17:47)
we kind of i would have guessed i would (17:45 - 17:48)
have i mean so i (17:47 - 17:51)
is your complaint why are you spoiling (17:48 - 17:52)
that right away why (17:51 - 17:54)
does twitter five minutes after (17:52 - 17:55)
something comes up (17:54 - 17:58)
spoil it why does it do it for literally (17:55 - 17:59)
every media that exists (17:58 - 18:02)
absolutely why was there cars (17:59 - 18:05)
driving past people waiting in harry (18:02 - 18:07)
potter line or in star wars lines (18:05 - 18:10)
screaming spoilers at them because they (18:07 - 18:11)
saw a preview of it (18:10 - 18:15)
because people are mean it wasn't (18:11 - 18:18)
the i i must the youtuber wasn't (18:15 - 18:20)
i don't think saying youtubers i saw (18:18 - 18:22)
like two of them (18:20 - 18:25)
they were like here's how you get x (18:22 - 18:28)
which is like oh we i want you to click (18:25 - 18:30)
on my video to see how to get it but all (18:28 - 18:30)
right (18:30 - 18:33)
they wanted to be the first uh yeah i'm (18:30 - 18:34)
the first person that told you how to do (18:33 - 18:36)
this (18:34 - 18:38)
all you have to do is say like i feel (18:36 - 18:40)
like if you want more clicks (18:38 - 18:41)
you say here's how you get the new (18:40 - 18:43)
legendary slash mythical pokemon because (18:41 - 18:44)
people will go (18:43 - 18:46)
too many oh it's too much thought and i (18:44 - 18:48)
don't know what you're talking about no (18:46 - 18:49)
because people would have been like (18:48 - 18:50)
which one is it (18:49 - 18:52)
no wouldn't you just say which one it is (18:50 - 18:55)
because the legendary slash mythical is (18:52 - 18:56)
in your like top (18:55 - 18:59)
25 percent of pokemon enthusiasts the (18:56 - 19:00)
bottom 75 percent (18:59 - 19:03)
no pokemon name i'm sorry like the (19:00 - 19:04)
middle 50 (19:03 - 19:08)
no pokemon names the lower 25 no pikachu (19:04 - 19:11)
and the fire lizard guy (19:08 - 19:15)
first off there look it's not volcanion (19:11 - 19:17)
i get it if it was like look this is how (19:15 - 19:19)
you get volcanion people would have been (19:17 - 19:21)
like (19:19 - 19:21)
which which one is that a pokemon (19:21 - 19:26)
it's the one that ash got stuck to in (19:24 - 19:27)
steampunk land (19:26 - 19:31)
i sincerely believe that if you said (19:27 - 19:35)
this is how you get the new legendary (19:31 - 19:37)
or mythical you could replace the words (19:35 - 19:38)
you could put a slash (19:37 - 19:41)
in the new pokemon snap dlc you would (19:38 - 19:42)
get more clicks (19:41 - 19:44)
because i would be like i wonder which (19:42 - 19:45)
one that is (19:44 - 19:48)
but but now that they said it one i'm (19:45 - 19:50)
annoyed but two i'm not going to click (19:48 - 19:51)
on your video because i don't (19:50 - 19:53)
wanna know how to get it i wanna figure (19:51 - 19:55)
it out myself (19:53 - 19:58)
but that's you you are a tiny percentage (19:55 - 19:59)
of the public (19:58 - 20:02)
you i don't think that the the vagueness (19:59 - 20:04)
of the pokemon would make you wanna (20:02 - 20:05)
click verse just (20:04 - 20:07)
laying the pokemon out amount of people (20:05 - 20:08)
that are absolutely (20:07 - 20:11)
spoiler averse are smaller than the (20:08 - 20:13)
people who don't care about spoilers (20:11 - 20:15)
i don't care about spoilers in fact (20:13 - 20:17)
knowing spoilers (20:15 - 20:18)
helps me enjoy things because i don't (20:17 - 20:20)
care about spoilers either (20:18 - 20:23)
in the sense of i was going to go to (20:20 - 20:25)
cereby and look it up (20:23 - 20:28)
i was more thinking this is the problem (20:25 - 20:30)
the more just like blatantly saying what (20:28 - 20:32)
it is on these like (20:30 - 20:35)
so that's that's that's that's not (20:32 - 20:37)
that's not caring about spoilers i would (20:35 - 20:39)
prefer to know (20:37 - 20:40)
because i would have gone to sarah and (20:39 - 20:42)
looked it up anyways (20:40 - 20:44)
the problem is number one the word is (20:42 - 20:46)
pronounced vague not vague (20:44 - 20:49)
uh and (20:46 - 20:49)
there's it's like piccolo but with a (20:55 - 20:59)
lewd in front of it this was (20:57 - 21:01)
a an issue with monster hunter rise as (20:59 - 21:02)
well (21:01 - 21:05)
because they literally and they're like (21:02 - 21:07)
it's fundamentally of like (21:05 - 21:09)
what is the purpose of having this (21:07 - 21:10)
creature in the game (21:09 - 21:12)
in monster hunter rise there's a (21:10 - 21:14)
creature that's supposed to show up and (21:12 - 21:16)
surprise you and be like oh geez that (21:14 - 21:17)
thing just (21:16 - 21:19)
what the heck was that that just came in (21:17 - 21:20)
and like within 30 minutes of it being (21:19 - 21:22)
intrusive game (21:20 - 21:25)
everybody had youtube videos and tweets (21:22 - 21:26)
and like oh they put this one in the (21:25 - 21:27)
game (21:26 - 21:29)
when they specifically had not put that (21:27 - 21:30)
in any of their (21:29 - 21:32)
and it's like it's the same thing right (21:30 - 21:34)
the legendary mythical is supposed to be (21:32 - 21:35)
oh wow (21:34 - 21:37)
this guy's in here what a surprise and (21:35 - 21:38)
like the (21:37 - 21:41)
the tweeters and everybody are ruining (21:38 - 21:41)
that (21:41 - 21:45)
surprise for everyone they put (21:41 - 21:46)
surprisosaurus rex in mount (21:45 - 21:49)
monster hunter yes they put surprise (21:46 - 21:51)
asaurus rex (21:49 - 21:55)
in monsters we've gone this whole (21:51 - 21:58)
show not saying which one it is (21:55 - 22:00)
yeah because i also don't know which one (21:58 - 22:02)
i've actually forgotten which one it (22:00 - 22:07)
is and i think (22:02 - 22:10)
for me the (22:07 - 22:13)
enjoyment of snap was being like oh look (22:10 - 22:13)
at (22:13 - 22:15)
i didn't know b doof was in this game or (22:13 - 22:16)
wow i didn't know blastoise was in this (22:15 - 22:17)
game or (22:16 - 22:21)
or whatnot right there are (22:17 - 22:23)
some exceptions you know if they if if (22:21 - 22:25)
if some if (22:23 - 22:27)
these pokemon were shown in a trailer (22:25 - 22:28)
like tropius (22:27 - 22:31)
or ursa ring or whatever was shown in (22:28 - 22:33)
the new pokemon snap trailer (22:31 - 22:34)
i feel like that's free game to talk (22:33 - 22:37)
about if somebody chooses not to watch (22:34 - 22:39)
the trailer (22:37 - 22:40)
and then complains when they're (22:39 - 22:42)
listening to a pokemon news podcast (22:40 - 22:44)
you know that's kind of on them at that (22:42 - 22:45)
point like we're talking about official (22:44 - 22:46)
media (22:45 - 22:48)
i do remember which one it is i just (22:46 - 22:49)
think from (22:48 - 22:52)
a i need i'm thinking from a youtuber (22:49 - 22:53)
i'm not a youtuber but i'm thinking from (22:52 - 22:56)
a i think you are a youtuber (22:53 - 22:59)
how how how can i get people to click on (22:56 - 23:00)
my video (22:59 - 23:02)
i i just think they get more mileage out (23:00 - 23:03)
of that click (23:02 - 23:08)
by being vague in that situation (23:03 - 23:11)
instead of just laying out and saying it (23:08 - 23:12)
i am trying to give them advice to (23:11 - 23:16)
increase their click bait (23:12 - 23:20)
and they just kind of they they uh (23:16 - 23:23)
they overshot see they were too direct (23:20 - 23:25)
what you're also missing is the people (23:23 - 23:27)
who are going to go to this video are (23:25 - 23:29)
the people who want the problem solved (23:27 - 23:30)
for them (23:29 - 23:31)
they don't they're not i want to put (23:30 - 23:33)
effort or thought into this kind of (23:31 - 23:35)
people so if you say (23:33 - 23:37)
legendary or mythical they're once again (23:35 - 23:39)
you're requiring effort and thought on (23:37 - 23:40)
their part for them to figure out what (23:39 - 23:42)
does that actually mean (23:40 - 23:44)
if i want to actually click on this (23:42 - 23:46)
video and and that's not the (23:44 - 23:47)
that's not the audience they're trying (23:46 - 23:52)
to appeal to i don't have time to waste (23:47 - 23:54)
on figuring out which mythical greg (23:52 - 23:55)
leatherman i (23:54 - 23:58)
went on to my switch on friday (23:55 - 24:01)
at like one in the afternoon and (23:58 - 24:03)

three new artists have joined the (27:39 - 27:43)
pokemon 25th anniversary including (27:40 - 27:47)
vince staples sin (27:43 - 27:50)
and zoo staples and sin contribute to an (27:47 - 27:51)
exclusive new song (27:50 - 27:55)
uh on the red ep (27:51 - 27:58)
there what what there's a lot happening (27:55 - 27:59)
in this press release and i'm not happy (27:58 - 28:01)
about it number one (27:59 - 28:03)
is vince staples the s is not (28:01 - 28:05)
capitalized in staples i don't know if (28:03 - 28:06)
that's supposed to be the proper (28:05 - 28:08)
but they capitalize in the next sentence (28:06 - 28:11)
number two is they capitalize the red ep (28:08 - 28:12)
but halfway through the sentence they (28:11 - 28:14)
just don't capitalize the red ep (28:12 - 28:17)
i don't uh but then they capitalize it (28:14 - 28:18)
again in the next sentence (28:17 - 28:21)
uh the ready p along with mabel's song (28:18 - 28:25)
take it home oh they capitalized vince (28:21 - 28:27)
staples at this one (28:25 - 28:30)
oh boy this seems this music thing (28:27 - 28:32)
seems like a disaster i'm just gonna be (28:30 - 28:35)
sad i'm sorry it's bad (28:32 - 28:39)
let me confirm is a disaster (28:35 - 28:42)
uh vince staples says i've always been a (28:39 - 28:44)
pokemon fan so i was particularly (28:42 - 28:45)
special to be asked to take part in the (28:44 - 28:47)
25th anniversary (28:45 - 28:50)
uh gotham vince staples faces the (28:47 - 28:50)
challenge (28:50 - 28:53)
head-on drawing inspiration from the (28:50 - 28:54)
iconic (28:53 - 28:57)
characters mew and raichu i mix well (28:54 - 28:59)
these jen wonders they picked (28:57 - 29:01)
i'm excited for people to get to hear (28:59 - 29:02)
gotham (29:01 - 29:04)
and i hope the song resonates with fans (29:02 - 29:05)
especially the ones that grew up with (29:04 - 29:07)
pokemon like i did (29:05 - 29:10)
sin offers the song wonderful (29:07 - 29:13)
i'm so excited to release one of my (29:10 - 29:14)
favorite songs i've ever written (29:13 - 29:15)
wonderful (29:14 - 29:17)
in the celebration 25 years of pokemon (29:15 - 29:19)
the song is special to me because i felt (29:17 - 29:22)
it comments on the growing pains also (29:19 - 29:24)
emphasizing a destination of grace and (29:22 - 29:25)
beauty (29:24 - 29:28)
uh eggs hatching (29:25 - 29:31)
when they want or in other words when (29:28 - 29:33)
they're ready (29:31 - 29:34)
that was a weird transition in that (29:33 - 29:36)
sentence when i wrote the song (29:34 - 29:38)
my newborn baby was in the room i can (29:36 - 29:40)
hear the influence of becoming a new (29:38 - 29:41)
mother in music (29:40 - 29:43)
it will always run special for me and (29:41 - 29:44)
then mabel (29:43 - 29:47)
literally just says take it home an (29:44 - 29:48)
original song from a brit (29:47 - 29:51)
award recipient mabel they i don't think (29:48 - 29:52)
they got a quote from her like they did (29:51 - 29:54)
the other two (29:52 - 29:56)
if they did the quote would be there i (29:54 - 29:58)
would assume well i mean (29:56 - 30:00)
the mabel song was released before the (29:58 - 30:01)
ep came out (30:00 - 30:04)
and the two others only appeared on this (30:01 - 30:06)
ep (30:04 - 30:09)
so i think i think mabel (30:06 - 30:13)
did a quote earlier about why i'm (30:09 - 30:16)
rolling around on a bed with jigglypuff (30:13 - 30:17)
when they when their song (30:16 - 30:20)
was yeah released on its own i watched (30:17 - 30:22)
the music video to that it was fine it (30:20 - 30:22)
was just like (30:22 - 30:24)
it didn't really stick out to me does (30:22 - 30:25)
this in (30:24 - 30:29)
in fur that there will be a blue ep (30:25 - 30:30)
there is a black there is a blue one (30:29 - 30:32)
it's gonna have uh (30:30 - 30:35)
katy perry and wait really the two (30:32 - 30:36)
people they announced (30:35 - 30:39)
zoo is going to be on the blue jays zoo (30:36 - 30:41)
is doing the remixes (30:39 - 30:44)
for the re red remix and the blue remix (30:41 - 30:46)
or is zoo doing a song on blue and (30:44 - 30:48)
somebody else is doing the remixes (30:46 - 30:51)
no if you scroll down uh it says (30:48 - 30:53)
reflecting the long-standing tradition (30:51 - 30:55)
of dual release the core (30:53 - 30:58)
of the core pokemon series uh which each (30:55 - 31:00)
featuring nuances difference from the (30:58 - 31:01)
original plan (31:00 - 31:03)
paying homage to the original pokemon (31:01 - 31:05)
red and blue the blue ep will follow (31:03 - 31:07)
later this month it will feature remixes (31:05 - 31:08)
of the red (31:07 - 31:11)
songs by recording grammy nominated (31:08 - 31:12)
recording artix (31:11 - 31:16)
artist zoo so zoo's doing the remixes (31:12 - 31:19)
so then so is blue not going to have (31:16 - 31:21)
any of the other songs on it is there (31:19 - 31:22)
going to be a yellow that is katy perry (31:21 - 31:23)
and somebody (31:22 - 31:26)
katy perry and (31:23 - 31:30)
uh what uh post malone and jay bal (31:26 - 31:32)
baldwin those are going to be on the (31:30 - 31:35)
official album (31:32 - 31:37)
which is supposed to be 10 songs i (31:35 - 31:38)
believe so we know (31:37 - 31:41)
three of the ten (31:38 - 31:41)
i'm very confused also it really bothers (31:42 - 31:46)
me (31:45 - 31:48)
this is i went to graphic design the (31:46 - 31:51)
pokemon blue ep and pokemon red ep (31:48 - 31:53)
in the yellow bar on the album is not (31:51 - 31:54)
properly centered it's (31:53 - 31:57)
too high and the accent on the e (31:54 - 31:59)
is touching the top and there's too much (31:57 - 32:00)
space on the bottom (31:59 - 32:04)
it's really bothersome because like it's (32:00 - 32:05)
a very simple album (32:04 - 32:07)
cover which is fine i i like simple i (32:05 - 32:10)
get the aesthetic (32:07 - 32:13)
but you got because there's (32:10 - 32:15)
not a lot to focus on it is very (32:13 - 32:16)
noticeable (32:15 - 32:19)
that it's not centered also they're (32:16 - 32:20)
using like (32:19 - 32:23)
myriad pro which a decent font fine (32:20 - 32:26)
just shift it down like two pixels you (32:23 - 32:27)
can do it (32:26 - 32:30)
so you guys probably don't know the (32:27 - 32:30)
answer (32:30 - 32:32)
but is vince staples related to the (32:30 - 32:35)
staple singers (32:32 - 32:35)
i've never heard of vince staples or the (32:35 - 32:39)
staples singers be honest (32:38 - 32:42)
i've heard of the staples center i heard (32:39 - 32:43)
of the staples the store (32:42 - 32:48)
i don't think so i would assume not (32:43 - 32:50)
it's not that common of a last name (32:48 - 32:52)
though it's not that uncommon (32:50 - 32:55)
i don't know i mean my last name's not (32:52 - 32:56)
common there's still a lot of us around (32:55 - 32:58)
well it's not like anderson in minnesota (32:56 - 33:01)
okay trust me look you made choices poor (32:58 - 33:02)
choices (33:01 - 33:05)
i mean anderson ii only after johnson (33:02 - 33:08)
so you could be william johnson and then (33:05 - 33:12)
nobody would know who you are (33:08 - 33:12)
uh i listened to it i don't remember (33:12 - 33:17)
listening to it i remember thinking (33:14 - 33:20)
oh vince staples says write you in the (33:17 - 33:21)
song it's the first time i've heard (33:20 - 33:22)
pokemon (33:21 - 33:24)
directly referenced in any of these (33:22 - 33:26)
songs i automatically like this one (33:24 - 33:27)
better (33:26 - 33:29)
but that was the extent of it they are (33:27 - 33:30)
to me (33:29 - 33:33)
very forgettable (33:30 - 33:33)
i move yeah it's (33:36 - 33:42)
fine it it (33:39 - 33:45)
can i can i just imagine this is the 20. (33:42 - 33:47)
can i get it on vinyl can i order a cd (33:45 - 33:48)
of it can i put my i want like a (33:47 - 33:50)
physical thing i don't have a spotify (33:48 - 33:53)
i can tell you can buy it (33:50 - 33:56)
digitally but you can't (33:53 - 34:01)
get it in a physical form (33:56 - 34:03)
that i've seen because none of the ways (34:01 - 34:04)
they show (34:03 - 34:08)
that list to get it have a (34:04 - 34:08)
have a physical anything it's like yeah (34:09 - 34:13)
i see you can play it on apple music you (34:11 - 34:15)
can play it on spotify you can download (34:13 - 34:16)
in the itunes store which (34:15 - 34:19)
i don't i think literally the last time (34:16 - 34:20)
i bought music from itunes (34:19 - 34:25)
was gorillas (34:20 - 34:27)
i don't know i don't remember what album (34:25 - 34:29)
that was i mean i just was about the (34:27 - 34:30)
first album because that was about like (34:29 - 34:31)
2 (34:30 - 34:34)
000 2000 no it was their last album (34:31 - 34:34)
i don't know which one it was i will i (34:36 - 34:39)
will if i like it i will always (34:38 - 34:41)
buy a physical copy because i don't want (34:39 - 34:43)
it to be removed (34:41 - 34:45)
and also i want to buy it in a way (34:43 - 34:46)
that's most direct (34:45 - 34:48)
so that the artist gets the most money (34:46 - 34:50)
so if they're on bank camp or some other (34:48 - 34:52)
way i will always buy a physical copy of (34:50 - 34:52)
it (34:52 - 34:54)
uh if not then i will go to itunes and (34:52 - 34:56)
buy a physical copy and i did not see a (34:54 - 34:59)
physical copy of (34:56 - 35:01)
this but since when i listened to it i (34:59 - 35:03)
was like and i don't want one (35:01 - 35:06)
it's also not available on amazon as uh (35:03 - 35:08)

i look i i'd be interested in physical (35:20 - 35:25)
version just to you know collect it (35:22 - 35:25)
maybe i'll come out at the end of the (35:26 - 35:29)

a whole collection to (35:29 - 35:34)
to get a bottle box it yeah (35:30 - 35:35)
well the only reason i think they're (35:34 - 35:37)
gonna do it is because (35:35 - 35:39)
how is thinking to distribute in japan (35:37 - 35:41)
they got record they they love their (35:39 - 35:44)
physical music over there (35:41 - 35:46)
they got he says speaking for a whole (35:44 - 35:47)
country they do (35:46 - 35:49)
they got tower records everywhere (35:47 - 35:51)
they're like 17 floors it's great (35:49 - 35:53)
we have record stores here too people (35:51 - 35:55)
love it (35:53 - 35:58)
yeah it's not the same it's not like (35:55 - 35:59)
because i remember i used to go to the (35:58 - 36:01)
tower records in manhattan and that (35:59 - 36:03)
thing was like five stories tall each (36:01 - 36:04)
story (36:03 - 36:06)
i mean each floor had its own like genre (36:04 - 36:08)
and everything (36:06 - 36:10)
that we don't have that anymore i took i (36:08 - 36:12)
took nick to electric fetus and we (36:10 - 36:14)
bought physical music okay that's a (36:12 - 36:15)
specialty store (36:14 - 36:18)
does does the 25th anniversary (36:15 - 36:22)
and this music which again (36:18 - 36:24)
we're i feel like we're always down in (36:22 - 36:26)
the music when it comes out (36:24 - 36:28)
i look i'm not down on it if you like (36:26 - 36:30)
this style of music and a lot of people (36:28 - 36:31)
do (36:30 - 36:32)
like people really love the katy perry (36:31 - 36:35)
song it didn't do anything for me (36:32 - 36:37)
it is not the music that i enjoy (36:35 - 36:38)
listening to there are a ton of people (36:37 - 36:39)
who like i know there are people in (36:38 - 36:41)
slack who are big vince staples song (36:39 - 36:43)
this is the first thing i've ever heard (36:41 - 36:45)
from vince staples yeah so (36:43 - 36:47)
like i don't have an opinion other than (36:45 - 36:49)
this is the type of music which i (36:47 - 36:51)
tend not to like when they have the (36:49 - 36:52)
jukebox the ghost (36:51 - 36:54)
pokemon song greg and i will be we will (36:52 - 36:57)
be there when the wolf parade pokemon (36:54 - 36:59)
comes out the tokyo police club that (36:57 - 37:01)
does something pokemon (36:59 - 37:05)
i'm in when the decemberists make their (37:01 - 37:08)
evil hardline hardline no decemberists (37:05 - 37:08)
those (37:08 - 37:10)
two those people are way too pompous and (37:08 - 37:11)
full of this (37:10 - 37:13)
and if you try to get stuff john stevens (37:11 - 37:15)
up in here at the moment i'm out the (37:13 - 37:15)
room (37:15 - 37:17)
yeah well he's gonna do he's gonna do a (37:15 - 37:18)
whole (37:17 - 37:21)
uh region album series stuff john (37:18 - 37:22)
stevens is digimon (37:21 - 37:25)
okay that's that's what i'm telling you (37:22 - 37:26)
i mean you're not wrong (37:25 - 37:28)
does okay so you know we have mellowetta (37:26 - 37:30)
and go they're putting a lot of music (37:28 - 37:32)
stuff (37:30 - 37:35)
etc etc does this end with us finally (37:32 - 37:37)
getting (37:35 - 37:40)
the sword and shield album like we don't (37:37 - 37:41)
have that music yet (37:40 - 37:45)
yeah yeah maybe no maybe (37:41 - 37:48)
also there's no g in etc (37:45 - 37:51)
is it weird that they haven't like (37:48 - 37:52)
they usually release them pretty quick (37:51 - 37:55)
in japan after the games come out (37:52 - 37:59)
right is that not let's go had (37:55 - 38:03)
let's go came out in november (37:59 - 38:06)
right or october november i went to (38:03 - 38:08)
japan (38:06 - 38:11)
in march the however many months that is (38:08 - 38:12)
five months (38:11 - 38:16)
and they had aisles of let's go music (38:12 - 38:19)
cds in their pokemon centers so it was (38:16 - 38:20)
less than six months (38:19 - 38:22)
hmm it's because there's one more secret (38:20 - 38:24)
dlc coming out (38:22 - 38:26)
that since they haven't released the (38:24 - 38:27)
that dlc they can't (38:26 - 38:30)
release the music from it yet (38:27 - 38:33)
so can we confirm that it's not like the (38:30 - 38:35)
it's not the soundtrack isn't uh the (38:33 - 38:38)
soundtrack is not out in japan (38:35 - 38:40)
no there's no sword and shield music at (38:38 - 38:41)
all (38:40 - 38:43)
it's very weird it's been almost two (38:41 - 38:44)
years (38:43 - 38:48)
we don't have music for that game (38:44 - 38:50)
oh side note speaking of dlc thank you (38:48 - 38:51)
will for bringing that up (38:50 - 38:54)
um i don't think there will be any more (38:51 - 38:55)
pokemon (38:54 - 38:59)
dlc because when the game originally got (38:55 - 39:00)
data mined (38:59 - 39:03)
there was a bunch of missing spots for (39:00 - 39:04)
icons (39:03 - 39:08)
player icons and for pokemon missing (39:04 - 39:12)
and now they're all filled in so there's (39:08 - 39:14)
no more missing spots or no more missing (39:12 - 39:18)
icons um so i don't think there will be (39:14 - 39:18)
like a (39:18 - 39:21)
second round of dlc maybe i don't know (39:18 - 39:22)
obviously they can always add pages you (39:21 - 39:23)
can always add (39:22 - 39:25)
they can always add it but where is (39:23 - 39:27)
missing no (39:25 - 39:29)
but when the dlc originally came out (39:27 - 39:30)
there was like 20 (39:29 - 39:32)
spots missing and then there was a bunch (39:30 - 39:33)
of icons (39:32 - 39:35)
for your like player character missing (39:33 - 39:36)
and now those are all filled in (39:35 - 39:38)
technically (39:36 - 39:38)
so (39:41 - 39:44)
for me this music thing is just like i (39:46 - 39:50)
don't care about it until it's done (39:48 - 39:54)
basically yeah (39:50 - 39:55)
it's it's like when they're like hyping (39:54 - 39:56)
up a movie and it's like look at all (39:55 - 39:58)
these new trailers and it's like i (39:56 - 40:00)
i'm already gonna i'll just wait it's (39:58 - 40:02)
fine (40:00 - 40:02)
i mean i don't just give me the whole (40:03 - 40:08)
thing when it's done (40:06 - 40:10)
i'll give it a chance then my same (40:08 - 40:11)
complaint stands (40:10 - 40:15)
i really wish the pokemon songs (40:11 - 40:19)
were more related to pokemon and not (40:15 - 40:22)
here's feelings i had while thinking (40:19 - 40:23)
about pokemon (40:22 - 40:25)
but i'm not going to mention pokemon in (40:23 - 40:26)
any way shape or form (40:25 - 40:29)
i'm going to use very generic terms (40:26 - 40:30)
here's (40:29 - 40:34)
a song that we fit onto an album (40:30 - 40:35)

i mean it is called wonderful that is a (40:50 - 40:56)
pokemon character's catchphrase (40:52 - 40:58)
i mean it's kind of like hatching eggs (40:56 - 41:00)
in pokemon to then having a newborn baby (40:58 - 41:03)
is kind of a stretch (41:00 - 41:08)
kinda it is the definition of a stretch (41:03 - 41:13)

trailer (53:18 - 53:23)
um so before we get to the drama i want (53:19 - 53:25)
to say this (53:23 - 53:25)
and i feel like we've literally said (53:26 - 53:30)
this every year once a year for pokemon (53:27 - 53:31)
go (53:30 - 53:33)
because there's always something people (53:31 - 53:35)
are mad about and then they go (53:33 - 53:37)
well niantic's just releasing these to (53:35 - 53:40)
hide the facts (53:37 - 53:43)
i was gonna work (53:40 - 53:43)
niantic takes so long to communicate (53:47 - 53:54)
anything with us they take so long to (53:51 - 53:56)
fix things (53:54 - 53:58)
they take so long to do anything in this (53:56 - 53:59)
game (53:58 - 54:03)
so while i understand (53:59 - 54:06)
and i'm on people's side of being upset (54:03 - 54:07)
about the (54:06 - 54:09)
changes they made during a global (54:07 - 54:10)
pandemic (54:09 - 54:14)
they didn't panic release galler to try (54:10 - 54:15)
to hide it (54:14 - 54:17)
they've clearly been working on this for (54:15 - 54:19)
months (54:17 - 54:20)
this is the same company that can't even (54:19 - 54:23)
release keklian (54:20 - 54:25)
and it took him four years to release (54:23 - 54:26)
this miracle (54:25 - 54:28)
i can't remember ever since they (54:26 - 54:31)
panicked released meltan (54:28 - 54:34)
you can't trust that company it probably (54:31 - 54:35)
took them all (54:34 - 54:38)
six months to like get this trailer done (54:35 - 54:41)
this isn't a panic release it was on the (54:38 - 54:43)
calendar and we know (54:41 - 54:46)
we know that niantic doesn't know how a (54:43 - 54:48)
calendar works right because (54:46 - 54:51)
before go fest they said hey on this (54:48 - 54:52)
date (54:51 - 54:53)
in the future in two months we're (54:52 - 54:56)
removing covid restrictions (54:53 - 54:58)
and you know what they did they removed (54:56 - 55:00)
them (54:58 - 55:02)
because that's how their calendar works (55:00 - 55:03)
they set something (55:02 - 55:07)
and then they just do it they don't have (55:03 - 55:08)
they don't know how to backpedal they (55:07 - 55:10)
don't know how to last-minute change (55:08 - 55:11)
they don't know how to do the (55:10 - 55:13)
communications they can't pivot they (55:11 - 55:14)
can't (55:13 - 55:16)
pivot the narrative of this was like a (55:14 - 55:18)
panic release (55:16 - 55:22)
is just mind-blowing to me like (55:18 - 55:22)
people justify their outrage people (55:24 - 55:28)
wanna people wanna justify (55:26 - 55:29)
that that they're interested in (55:28 - 55:31)
interested in this thing (55:29 - 55:32)
while they're still mad at the thing by (55:31 - 55:34)
saying oh this is a panic release to (55:32 - 55:35)
distract me meaning (55:34 - 55:38)
i really want to do this but i'm also (55:35 - 55:40)
still mad at the stupid choices they (55:38 - 55:42)
made (55:40 - 55:42)
the choice they made is is stupid yeah (55:42 - 55:46)
it's dumb (55:45 - 55:47)
the covet stuff is dumb we're going to (55:46 - 55:49)
get to that in a second (55:47 - 55:53)
the the ultra unlock being sword and (55:49 - 55:53)
shield (55:53 - 55:57)
is really good like no one predicted it (55:53 - 55:57)
so having (55:57 - 56:01)
i wanted it to be arceus yes (55:57 - 56:03)
yeah or you know giratino or whatever (56:01 - 56:05)
you know pattern (56:03 - 56:08)
tina we need hoopa we need volcanion we (56:05 - 56:10)
need we need kecleon we need actually (56:08 - 56:12)
we need literally yeah for the gen 5 (56:10 - 56:14)
pokedex yeah (56:12 - 56:16)
yeah there's a lot missing but we're (56:14 - 56:18)
just gonna jump to seven (56:16 - 56:21)
which is whatever like why who cares if (56:18 - 56:23)
we're following it in order (56:21 - 56:25)
like at this point it it it doesn't (56:23 - 56:26)
matter patterns are (56:25 - 56:29)
not patterns it's (56:26 - 56:32)
like catch the sheep evolve the sheep (56:29 - 56:33)
then complain (56:32 - 56:34)
for the next five years that there's too (56:33 - 56:36)
many sheep like that i can't catch the (56:34 - 56:38)
sheep because go goats not (56:36 - 56:41)
in the game yet yeah there you go (56:38 - 56:42)
there's no go-go (56:41 - 56:45)
i still think (56:42 - 56:47)
like when sword and shield came out they (56:45 - 56:49)
should have just released wulu and (56:47 - 56:50)
squabbit and all the other things (56:49 - 56:53)
and that was the perfect opportunity to (56:50 - 56:54)
like line things up (56:53 - 56:56)
who cares if things are not in order and (56:54 - 56:58)
i was like everyone was like well they (56:56 - 57:01)
gotta go in order and it's like why (56:58 - 57:02)
well go because they've been doing it (57:01 - 57:04)
well okay after fi they're not doing it (57:02 - 57:05)
anymore (57:04 - 57:07)
well they haven't been doing it when (57:05 - 57:08)
they released wheezing like two years (57:07 - 57:10)
ago or whatever (57:08 - 57:12)
like who cares about this order just (57:10 - 57:15)
just release the pokemon (57:12 - 57:18)
i think that well i guess it doesn't (57:15 - 57:19)
matter i mean storage shield sold (57:18 - 57:20)
incredibly well (57:19 - 57:21)
it's like the third best-selling game (57:20 - 57:23)
it's like 21 million at this point (57:21 - 57:26)
i just think thematically it's been (57:23 - 57:27)
enjoyable (57:26 - 57:29)
when you open up masters they're doing (57:27 - 57:31)
an event that also pokemon go is doing (57:29 - 57:33)
that's also in sword and shield that's (57:31 - 57:33)
also (57:33 - 57:37)
you know in the tcg and we'll get there (57:33 - 57:38)
eventually (57:37 - 57:40)
you know pokemon go is going to catch up (57:38 - 57:41)
they're going to release gen 9 or gen 10 (57:40 - 57:43)
and as long as pokemon go isn't canceled (57:41 - 57:44)
by that (57:43 - 57:45)
point you know things will be in (57:44 - 57:50)
symmetry but whatever i (57:45 - 57:50)
i would like an extra zashian and an (57:50 - 57:54)
extra zamasu without playing through the (57:52 - 57:54)
game again (57:54 - 57:58)
that seems cool yeah i would like a wulu (57:54 - 58:02)
seems cool uh squavid's cute (57:58 - 58:05)
i very weird that they were like you (58:02 - 58:06)
know (58:05 - 58:08)
hey we have a bunch of low legendaries (58:06 - 58:11)
we could have done as well (58:08 - 58:13)
like that's fine maybe they have (58:11 - 58:16)
something else cooler for that (58:13 - 58:16)
i mean a calendar at a certain point we (58:17 - 58:20)
have to get gigantomax (58:19 - 58:21)
at a certain point we have to get (58:20 - 58:24)
dynamax yeah (58:21 - 58:26)
we're probably going to get z moves or (58:24 - 58:27)
something (58:26 - 58:30)
go battle league is still a hot mess (58:27 - 58:30)
i think outrage aside the ultra unlock (58:31 - 58:37)
part three (58:35 - 58:39)
seems cool it seems like great i mean (58:37 - 58:41)
and like i think (58:39 - 58:44)
how do you top finally putting shiny the (58:41 - 58:46)
alga and shiny pokey on raids which you (58:44 - 58:47)
know people wanted for a very very long (58:46 - 58:49)
time (58:47 - 58:52)
i don't think you know (58:49 - 58:52)
tapu coco would be as exciting maybe (58:53 - 58:59)
well for somebody who rarely if ever (58:56 - 59:00)
does raids if (58:59 - 59:03)
unless i'm like it's right in front of (59:00 - 59:06)
me and you guys are forcing me to this (59:03 - 59:07)
this is like a (59:06 - 59:09)
it's a non-event like yeah i'll catch (59:07 - 59:10)
the the gallerian (59:09 - 59:12)
nuclearians that they're gonna drop if (59:10 - 59:14)
my pokeball (59:12 - 59:20)
hack catches them otherwise yeah (59:14 - 59:20)
yeah i mean instead of wulu and squivet (59:20 - 59:26)
they could have done (59:23 - 59:26)
what are the uh young goose and (59:26 - 59:33)
what's the other one pikapec yeah (59:30 - 59:37)
yeah yeah i guess that would be it uh it (59:33 - 59:38)
it's it seems like it seems fine it (59:37 - 59:40)
seems like an exciting event (59:38 - 59:43)
whether or not you know people are not (59:40 - 59:45)
playing or playing i mean that's a (59:43 - 59:47)
that's up to them but i think the (59:45 - 59:49)
trailer they did for it i think the (59:47 - 59:51)
announcement i think was all good (59:49 - 59:54)
if you want real drama concerning (59:51 - 59:57)
uniforms greg (59:54 - 60:00)
yes stop putting that garbage on my (59:57 - 60:02)
instagram timeline i don't care who the (60:00 - 60:02)
artist (60:02 - 60:06)
is talk about the milo stuff yes (60:02 - 60:09)
stop it i don't want to see that milo is (60:06 - 60:13)
the best oh you're getting an unfollow (60:09 - 60:15)
fine uh you can't handle the hotness you (60:13 - 60:18)
can't handle what's good and what's cool (60:15 - 60:21)
then you garbage up your feed with your (60:18 - 60:25)
natty body pillows that went to thailand (60:21 - 60:25)
okay so before go fest we got to paint (60:28 - 60:32)
the picture here (60:31 - 60:36)
so because so pokemon go is a very big (60:32 - 60:36)
game (60:36 - 60:40)
there's a lot of players and there are (60:36 - 60:43)
a lot of hardcore players that pokemon (60:40 - 60:46)
go is their life and their identity (60:43 - 60:47)
and i don't mean that negatively that's (60:46 - 60:49)
you know some people you know world of (60:47 - 60:50)
warcraft is their life (60:49 - 60:52)
and their identity oh let's not bring (60:50 - 60:57)
them up right now (60:52 - 61:00)
and so before go fest they said we're (60:57 - 61:01)
gonna remove (61:00 - 61:04)
these coved restrictions in (61:01 - 61:07)
new zealand and the united the united (61:04 - 61:08)
states (61:07 - 61:11)
which on one hand you could be like (61:08 - 61:13)
well the united states has had a pretty (61:11 - 61:15)
decent rollout (61:13 - 61:17)
compared to other countries and new (61:15 - 61:18)
zealand's been pretty (61:17 - 61:21)
good for a while like new zealand's been (61:18 - 61:22)
pretty awesome everyone like seems to (61:21 - 61:25)
look to new zealand (61:22 - 61:28)
so you're like okay (61:25 - 61:28)
and this is not the first time niantic's (61:28 - 61:36)
removed features when the pandemic has (61:32 - 61:36)
gotten (61:36 - 61:39)
worse which goes to my beginning (61:36 - 61:40)
argument of this company doesn't know (61:39 - 61:43)
how to pivot (61:40 - 61:46)
probably because they need approval from (61:43 - 61:50)
pokemon or nintendo or google or (61:46 - 61:53)
who knows maybe john hanke lost (61:50 - 61:55)
masuda's phone number i'm not sure what (61:53 - 61:57)
happened there (61:55 - 61:57)
but when they announced their covid (61:59 - 62:03)
restriction and maybe i miss remembering (62:01 - 62:05)
greg and well you can (62:03 - 62:07)
let me know just trying to be fair (62:05 - 62:09)
before we get into this (62:07 - 62:10)
when they announced they were rolling (62:09 - 62:12)
back their coveted restrictions which (62:10 - 62:14)
was like two months ago which was after (62:12 - 62:16)
go fest (62:14 - 62:19)
everything was looking pretty good greg (62:16 - 62:21)
was planning on going to gen con (62:19 - 62:24)
pax was being taxes announced and and (62:21 - 62:25)
happening (62:24 - 62:28)
yeah i mean things were looking not (62:25 - 62:32)
things were were not good but they had (62:28 - 62:34)
shown signs of improvement but still at (62:32 - 62:36)
that time (62:34 - 62:38)
there were some worrying signs but (62:36 - 62:40)
people had already decided (62:38 - 62:44)
to go forward with the understanding (62:40 - 62:47)
of we would hit the july 4th benchmark (62:44 - 62:49)
that we were supposed to hit (62:47 - 62:53)
yeah it was before like the fourth of (62:49 - 62:54)
july and everything right (62:53 - 62:57)
yeah like we were still technically on (62:54 - 62:59)
track there were some worrying signs but (62:57 - 63:00)
like (62:59 - 63:04)
technically the the signs were hey we're (63:00 - 63:08)
probably going to get there (63:04 - 63:08)
yes and then the delta stuff got worse (63:09 - 63:18)
oh yeah um (63:14 - 63:18)
and like classic niantic when that date (63:18 - 63:23)
came around (63:22 - 63:28)
they flipped their switch and (63:23 - 63:28)
things got turned off and the new things (63:28 - 63:33)
got turned on there are new things like (63:31 - 63:35)
instead of getting one free raid pass a (63:33 - 63:37)
day you get two free ray passes and (63:35 - 63:37)
there's some other (63:37 - 63:39)
you can see in the app you don't i don't (63:37 - 63:41)
have to explain it all but the biggest (63:39 - 63:43)
thing was (63:41 - 63:46)
the distance of interacting (63:43 - 63:50)
with a pokestop and jim (63:46 - 63:54)
returned to normal (63:50 - 63:54)
and that's what made people upset (63:55 - 64:00)
because (63:58 - 64:00)
not only did it make it easier to reach (64:01 - 64:06)
pokestops (64:04 - 64:08)
but it added a lot of people who have (64:06 - 64:10)
trouble walking maybe they're (64:08 - 64:12)
on crutches or in a wheelchair or (64:10 - 64:13)
bedridden (64:12 - 64:16)
made it easier for them to play the game (64:13 - 64:19)
but also from a person who is outside (64:16 - 64:20)
and i want to give a very specific (64:19 - 64:23)
situation for me it's again it's it's (64:20 - 64:24)
it's a first world problem not the end (64:23 - 64:25)
of the world (64:24 - 64:30)
but this is the but like (64:25 - 64:30)
before i explain the situation i will (64:31 - 64:34)
say the first four years of pokemon go (64:32 - 64:36)
with the (64:34 - 64:39)
distance was always fine (64:36 - 64:42)
but when they increased it it was better (64:39 - 64:47)
and so i went downtown milwaukee (64:42 - 64:48)
during the afternoon which is paid (64:47 - 64:50)
parking i parked (64:48 - 64:52)
because i was picking up some food paid (64:50 - 64:54)
like a dollar fifty to park (64:52 - 64:57)
there was two raids one was a hair cross (64:54 - 64:58)
cool used my free raid pass did the hair (64:57 - 64:59)
cross (64:58 - 65:02)
walked over to a different raid (64:59 - 65:05)
did my unknown with my free raid pass (65:02 - 65:06)
picked up my food got my car and then i (65:05 - 65:08)
saw a palkia (65:06 - 65:09)
and i was like okay well i still have (65:08 - 65:11)
another free raid pass from yesterday (65:09 - 65:13)
i want to go do that palkia but i can't (65:11 - 65:15)
i can't walk there (65:13 - 65:16)
i mean i can but it's like 15 minutes (65:15 - 65:18)
there 15 minutes back so it's just (65:16 - 65:20)
easier if i drive over there (65:18 - 65:23)
so i drove over there and again i was (65:20 - 65:24)
like well (65:23 - 65:28)
oh cool a parking spot i parked (65:24 - 65:31)
but i was just out of the distance (65:28 - 65:33)
of it and i was like well if i get out (65:31 - 65:34)
of my car and walk over there i have to (65:33 - 65:36)
pay for parking (65:34 - 65:38)
or i could try to go down the street (65:36 - 65:39)
u-turn (65:38 - 65:42)
park again or i could go a little (65:39 - 65:43)
farther (65:42 - 65:47)
and then get free parking but then walk (65:43 - 65:50)
and at that point in all of this like (65:47 - 65:52)
driving two minutes to get there and (65:50 - 65:55)
then trying to find parking (65:52 - 65:57)
i just left the rate it wasn't worth it (65:55 - 66:00)
anymore like i want to play your game (65:57 - 66:03)
and i can't reach the gym even though (66:00 - 66:05)
like i should be able to like i'm so (66:03 - 66:06)
close to it like if i had like (66:05 - 66:09)
two more spots in front of me i would be (66:06 - 66:11)
able to pull forward and do it (66:09 - 66:14)
but i don't want to pay a dollar fifty (66:11 - 66:15)
to park (66:14 - 66:16)
i don't wanna drive farther and then (66:15 - 66:18)
walk five minutes (66:16 - 66:20)
i could just remote raid pass for a (66:18 - 66:22)
dollar at this point and it would have (66:20 - 66:22)
been (66:22 - 66:24)
significantly easier and it would have (66:22 - 66:27)
been cheaper than paying for parking (66:24 - 66:27)
so it's like i i didn't (66:28 - 66:35)
play your game because it was an (66:32 - 66:37)
inconvenience for me (66:35 - 66:39)
and just having the distance be a little (66:37 - 66:41)
bit bigger (66:39 - 66:42)
where i can reach a gym across the (66:41 - 66:44)
street wait why couldn't you use a (66:42 - 66:46)
remote raid pass oh (66:44 - 66:48)
i had a free raid pass for the day why (66:46 - 66:49)
wouldn't i want to try it you just (66:48 - 66:51)
you just said you would have used a (66:49 - 66:53)
remote raid i could have used a remote (66:51 - 66:54)
raid pass and it would have been cheaper (66:53 - 66:55)
than (66:54 - 66:57)
parking before greg says what he has to (66:55 - 66:58)
say number one (66:57 - 67:00)
don't be a wuss risk the ticket get out (66:58 - 67:03)
the car park it don't pay (67:00 - 67:05)
chinese worth the ticket i knew you guys (67:03 - 67:06)
are gonna say that (67:05 - 67:08)
you guys pay for the light rail here in (67:06 - 67:09)
minneapolis like (67:08 - 67:12)
fools you don't leave your car for five (67:09 - 67:14)
minutes thinking that some (67:12 - 67:17)
meter person is just waiting like a (67:14 - 67:20)
vulture to swoop down and write you a 25 (67:17 - 67:22)
ticket come on i think there are so many (67:20 - 67:25)
situations where (67:22 - 67:25)
people would play the game more maybe i (67:26 - 67:29)
don't know (67:29 - 67:31)
i think people have been people have (67:29 - 67:32)
been saying this maybe we haven't set in (67:31 - 67:33)
the show (67:32 - 67:37)
but i don't want to cross a dangerous (67:33 - 67:39)
intersection (67:37 - 67:42)
or like try to repark my car or to make (67:39 - 67:43)
a u-turn or to do this (67:42 - 67:45)
if i could just like slightly reach the (67:43 - 67:46)
stop a little bit better (67:45 - 67:49)
and safely or you could pay the dollar (67:46 - 67:50)
like they want you to do (67:49 - 67:53)
so they can make money there's there's a (67:50 - 67:54)
couple of things (67:53 - 67:57)
that one it wasn't like the distance was (67:54 - 67:59)
a mile (67:57 - 68:01)
right it wasn't like i could sit in my (67:59 - 68:03)
house and reach everything within my (68:01 - 68:05)
in a mile it was like 80 meters at the (68:03 - 68:06)
at the new distance (68:05 - 68:10)
which meant i was 800 meters because i (68:06 - 68:10)
think the (68:10 - 68:13)
original distance is 400 meters but it's (68:10 - 68:14)
but it's a (68:13 - 68:16)
like it's it's not 400 meters there it's (68:14 - 68:17)
it's (68:16 - 68:21)
200 both ways because it makes us (68:17 - 68:22)
circle i don't know how circumference (68:21 - 68:25)
works but i believe it's 400 and then (68:22 - 68:27)
the new one was 800 and then they (68:25 - 68:28)
brought it back down to 400 i think (68:27 - 68:29)
that's how it works (68:28 - 68:32)
whatever it was it wasn't that (68:29 - 68:34)
it wasn't that i still didn't have to (68:32 - 68:35)
get to that range (68:34 - 68:38)
what it did do apart from making it (68:35 - 68:39)
easier (68:38 - 68:42)
for people to just get to it but a lot (68:39 - 68:43)
of their landmarks (68:42 - 68:46)
a lot of the things are inside things (68:43 - 68:49)
and when the distance was increased you (68:46 - 68:52)
could be outside where it was safer and (68:49 - 68:53)
you were in the open (68:52 - 68:55)
and reached things that were enclosed in (68:53 - 68:57)
small places (68:55 - 68:58)
so in downtown minneapolis there are (68:57 - 69:00)
starbucks that are only inside (68:58 - 69:03)
there are murals that are only inside (69:00 - 69:05)
and you could finally reach them from (69:03 - 69:07)
the outside i still had to walk (69:05 - 69:11)
there i still had to get to that area by (69:07 - 69:12)
walking or whatever (69:11 - 69:15)
but i did no longer had to be inside an (69:12 - 69:16)
enclosed area (69:15 - 69:19)
which we all know isn't safe so the (69:16 - 69:21)
frustrating thing about how they (69:19 - 69:23)
presented this change back (69:21 - 69:25)
was well we want you to walk well it it (69:23 - 69:27)
wasn't 50 miles (69:25 - 69:29)
it wasn't that i could get to a million (69:27 - 69:32)
stops by just sitting in my home (69:29 - 69:35)
i still had to walk there so their (69:32 - 69:37)
reasoning from the very beginning (69:35 - 69:40)
was not a good reason i still have to (69:37 - 69:41)
walk to it (69:40 - 69:43)
and you keep saying you're monitoring (69:41 - 69:44)
the situation (69:43 - 69:46)
you're not because the situation turned (69:44 - 69:48)
at the beginning of july (69:46 - 69:50)
and you didn't touch it or re-examine it (69:48 - 69:51)
in the three weeks (69:50 - 69:53)
that you had before you turned it off (69:51 - 69:54)
you did (69:53 - 69:56)
nothing so the biggest issue i have with (69:54 - 69:59)
the communication is not only are they (69:56 - 70:00)
bad at it (69:59 - 70:02)
is that they they don't even think about (70:00 - 70:03)
what they're saying they contradict (70:02 - 70:04)
themselves (70:03 - 70:07)
their words never match up to what they (70:04 - 70:08)
actually say they're doing (70:07 - 70:10)
if you were watching the situation we (70:08 - 70:12)
knew this was bad (70:10 - 70:14)
at the beginning of july we knew this (70:12 - 70:15)
was bad (70:14 - 70:19)
during go fast we knew this was bad (70:15 - 70:20)
and you keep saying well we're (70:19 - 70:22)
monitoring it and we're gonna (70:20 - 70:24)
choose you're not monitoring it in fact (70:22 - 70:26)
you didn't even say anything about it (70:24 - 70:28)
until a bunch of people said (70:26 - 70:30)
we don't want to play your game anymore (70:28 - 70:31)
and we're not going to give you free (70:30 - 70:32)
advertising (70:31 - 70:34)
and we're going to give you bad (70:32 - 70:36)
advertisement and then you put out a (70:34 - 70:40)
incredibly tepid press release (70:36 - 70:40)
you can't happen both ways you can't say (70:40 - 70:44)
we're monitoring it (70:43 - 70:46)
and then not actually monitor the (70:44 - 70:47)
situation (70:46 - 70:50)
or listen to anybody giving you feedback (70:47 - 70:52)
you can't do that and expect people to (70:50 - 70:55)
respect your company (70:52 - 70:57)
good transition i have the press release (70:55 - 71:00)
here (70:57 - 71:03)
the the press releases on their official (71:00 - 71:04)
website (71:03 - 71:08)
not on pokemon go live.com (71:04 - 71:11)
which i've been saying this for years we (71:08 - 71:13)
have i have no proof i'm sorry i don't (71:11 - 71:15)
and i'm sure niantic will never just (71:13 - 71:17)
come out and say this (71:15 - 71:19)
but i'm almost positive they cannot post (71:17 - 71:20)
anything live (71:19 - 71:22)
they cannot post anything on (71:20 - 71:25)
pokemongolive.com without pokemon's (71:22 - 71:26)
approval (71:25 - 71:30)
and normally it takes them (71:26 - 71:34)
normally they don't respond to things in (71:30 - 71:35)
the same day (71:34 - 71:37)
so since they responded this in the same (71:35 - 71:39)
day and they were they didn't post it on (71:37 - 71:40)
pokemongolive.com even though it's (71:39 - 71:42)
specifically for pokemon go people (71:40 - 71:45)
they post it on their own website makes (71:42 - 71:48)
me think that (71:45 - 71:48)
they didn't write it they didn't run it (71:50 - 71:53)
through the approvals that they normally (71:52 - 71:54)
have to run it for pokemon (71:53 - 71:56)
stuff or they ran it through like a (71:54 - 71:58)
lighter approval yeah they went through (71:56 - 71:58)
their legal (71:58 - 72:01)
department to say how how quickly will (71:58 - 72:03)
we get sued and is just breaching any (72:01 - 72:04)
contracts yes or no (72:03 - 72:05)
because they needed to put out something (72:04 - 72:07)
okay so the reason they put out a press (72:05 - 72:08)
release (72:07 - 72:11)
they they announced the the kova changes (72:08 - 72:13)
happened (72:11 - 72:14)
on whatever monday tuesday i don't (72:13 - 72:17)
remember well the reversion of the (72:14 - 72:19)
reversion of them and then they did the (72:17 - 72:22)
ultra release 3 which we talked about (72:19 - 72:22)
and then (72:22 - 72:26)
on thursday i've (72:22 - 72:27)
i have an issue with the pokemon go (72:26 - 72:30)
community (72:27 - 72:33)
but they i but i believe a bunch of (72:30 - 72:35)
really big pokemon go youtubers most of (72:33 - 72:37)
them (72:35 - 72:40)
got together they wrote a letter (72:37 - 72:42)
it was very well written i believe it (72:40 - 72:43)
was written by zoe two dots she's (72:42 - 72:44)
awesome (72:43 - 72:47)
she's a friend of mine and they (72:44 - 72:50)
used the hashtag it got to like number (72:47 - 72:51)
12 trending (72:50 - 72:54)
in on twitter a bunch of other pokemon (72:51 - 72:54)
go people (72:54 - 72:58)
you know tweeted it pokemon go fans (72:54 - 73:01)
and niantic then released something i (72:58 - 73:02)
think it was like 8 (73:01 - 73:07)
30 central time pm at night (73:02 - 73:10)
after the response so i don't think i (73:07 - 73:11)
don't think it's like (73:10 - 73:12)
well they released in the night so no (73:11 - 73:14)
one would read it (73:12 - 73:16)
no i just think it took them all day (73:14 - 73:18)
legally to get something (73:16 - 73:19)
something approved and that was the (73:18 - 73:21)
fastest they could release it i don't (73:19 - 73:22)
think it was like (73:21 - 73:23)
oh let's release in the middle of the (73:22 - 73:25)
night so no one can read it like i don't (73:23 - 73:25)
think that was (73:25 - 73:28)
the case um i will say though my (73:25 - 73:30)
complaint here (73:28 - 73:32)
is if you're going to complain about a (73:30 - 73:35)
video game that you like (73:32 - 73:38)
maybe don't complain (73:35 - 73:38)
when nothing is happening in said video (73:39 - 73:42)
game like (73:41 - 73:44)
i don't know who decided thursday was (73:42 - 73:46)
the best day but (73:44 - 73:48)
i think it's a little ironic that it was (73:46 - 73:49)
like the day (73:48 - 73:53)
after diago ends and the day before (73:49 - 73:56)
palkia starts like oh i can't (73:53 - 73:58)
we can't announce it on this day we (73:56 - 74:00)
still gotta finish our dialga raids (73:58 - 74:01)
well we have to do it before palkia (74:00 - 74:03)
starts because i want to get shiny (74:01 - 74:06)
like it's just like i don't know maybe (74:03 - 74:08)
you should have like (74:06 - 74:10)
put your money where your mouth is and (74:08 - 74:13)
maybe do it the day that palkia starts (74:10 - 74:17)
and like boycott palkia i don't know (74:13 - 74:18)
it just it was it was a little funny and (74:17 - 74:20)
ironic to me that they did on a thursday (74:18 - 74:21)
when (74:20 - 74:22)
literally nothing in the game was (74:21 - 74:25)
happening um (74:22 - 74:28)
that's just a side note anyways uh (74:25 - 74:30)
okay i was right it said we've rooted (74:28 - 74:32)
the interactions from 80 meters to 40 (74:30 - 74:33)
meters (74:32 - 74:34)
i thought it was that's what it says in (74:33 - 74:36)
the press really maybe i'm thinking feet (74:34 - 74:38)
i don't know how meters and feet (74:36 - 74:40)
translate they are different three feet (74:38 - 74:41)
per meter (74:40 - 74:44)
yeah uh okay (74:41 - 74:48)
here's what it says meters this is 162 (74:44 - 74:49)
feet (74:48 - 74:51)
nianticlabs.com what about millimeters (74:49 - 74:52)
uh (74:51 - 74:55)
we uh we appreciate your letter and (74:52 - 74:58)
all your feedback we hear you we are (74:55 - 75:00)
humbled by your response (74:58 - 75:03)
not every game has a passionate global (75:00 - 75:05)
base that we are fortunate enough to (75:03 - 75:06)
have (75:05 - 75:09)
lie you need to beat some other fan (75:06 - 75:10)
bases (75:09 - 75:12)
like everyone around the world our team (75:10 - 75:14)
has been working very hard to adapt the (75:12 - 75:16)
global health environment (75:14 - 75:19)
recent exploration bonuses we've made in (75:16 - 75:20)
us (75:19 - 75:22)
and new zealand are designed to restore (75:20 - 75:23)
some of the foundational (75:22 - 75:26)
elements that players enjoyed prior to (75:23 - 75:26)
2020 (75:26 - 75:29)
and reward players once again for moving (75:26 - 75:31)
and exploring (75:29 - 75:33)
encoura encouraging people to explore (75:31 - 75:34)
exercise (75:33 - 75:37)
and safely play together in person (75:34 - 75:38)
remains (75:37 - 75:42)
niantic's mission okay that's (75:38 - 75:44)
true they have like three pillars if you (75:42 - 75:45)
go to like their thing it's like (75:44 - 75:46)
exercise (75:45 - 75:49)
getting together and i think exploring i (75:46 - 75:50)
think that are (75:49 - 75:52)
those are the three pillars of like all (75:50 - 75:53)
their games are based off those three (75:52 - 75:54)
things (75:53 - 75:56)
surprising just in case people don't (75:54 - 75:58)
know niantic does make more than pokemon (75:56 - 76:00)
go they make (75:58 - 76:03)
they make other video games the health (76:00 - 76:04)
and well-being of our players is our top (76:03 - 76:05)
priority (76:04 - 76:07)
which is why we implemented the new (76:05 - 76:10)
excluration bonuses in select (76:07 - 76:13)
geographies geographies where it is (76:10 - 76:15)
deemed safe to be outdoors (76:13 - 76:16)
research has shown that taking walks (76:15 - 76:19)
outside is safe and confers (76:16 - 76:21)
several health benefits furthermore (76:19 - 76:24)
encouraging outdoor exploration (76:21 - 76:26)
is in keeping with niantic's mission (76:24 - 76:28)
that said we will continue to monitor (76:26 - 76:29)
the health and safety (76:28 - 76:31)
related to outdoor activities and will (76:29 - 76:32)
further make changes (76:31 - 76:35)
if necessary we have heard your feedback (76:32 - 76:38)
about one change in particular (76:35 - 76:40)
that of the pokestop and gym interaction (76:38 - 76:42)
distance we have reverted the distance (76:40 - 76:43)
from (76:42 - 76:45)
80 meters to the original 40 meters (76:43 - 76:47)
starting in the us and new zealand (76:45 - 76:48)
because we want to see people connect (76:47 - 76:50)
with real places in the real world (76:48 - 76:52)
and visiting those places that are worth (76:50 - 76:54)
exploring however (76:52 - 76:56)
we have heard your input loud and clear (76:54 - 76:58)
and so to address your concerns you have (76:56 - 76:59)
raised (76:58 - 77:02)
we are taking the following actions (76:59 - 77:04)
we are assembling an internal (77:02 - 77:06)
cross-functional functional team to (77:04 - 77:08)
develop proposal designs (77:06 - 77:11)
to preserve our mission of inspiring (77:08 - 77:14)
people to explore the world together (77:11 - 77:16)
while also addressing specific concerns (77:14 - 77:18)
that have been raised regarding (77:16 - 77:20)
interaction distance we will share the (77:18 - 77:24)
findings of this task force (77:20 - 77:27)
by the next game season change on (77:24 - 77:29)
september 1st (77:27 - 77:30)
as part of this process we will be (77:29 - 77:32)
reaching out to community leaders in the (77:30 - 77:35)
coming days to join us in this dialogue (77:32 - 77:38)
our goal is to build fun and engaging (77:35 - 77:39)
experiences to remain true to our (77:38 - 77:41)
mission and we thank you for (77:39 - 77:43)
challenging us with thoughtful and (77:41 - 77:44)
constructive feedback (77:43 - 77:47)
the niantic team but what they're saying (77:44 - 77:48)
is we have (77:47 - 77:51)
multiple games in (77:48 - 77:54)
production and we are going to bring (77:51 - 77:56)
together (77:54 - 77:59)
specialists or department heads from (77:56 - 78:00)
each of those (77:59 - 78:03)
other games to talk about a universal (78:00 - 78:05)
overarching policy that we'll put in (78:03 - 78:06)
place so that (78:05 - 78:09)
everybody matches up it is different (78:06 - 78:10)
than getting feedback from (78:09 - 78:13)
say you it is we have to make sure (78:10 - 78:16)
internally that we make this chain (78:13 - 78:18)
change every game is on board and we're (78:16 - 78:20)
all doing it the same way (78:18 - 78:23)
and so it is a legal thing it is (78:20 - 78:26)
a we want to make sure that we are (78:23 - 78:28)
giving the same message (78:26 - 78:32)
so that so that niantic as a company (78:28 - 78:35)
is able to say here's the changing we'll (78:32 - 78:36)
make (78:35 - 78:37)
here's the change we're making across (78:36 - 78:39)
board so that (78:37 - 78:42)
harry potter and ingress and pokemon go (78:39 - 78:42)
and (78:42 - 78:44)
transformers go and transformers and all (78:42 - 78:46)
the things that they make (78:44 - 78:48)
match so they do need to bring everybody (78:46 - 78:49)
from each department (78:48 - 78:51)
internally together and say here's what (78:49 - 78:52)
we're doing (78:51 - 78:56)
will this affect your game in any way (78:52 - 78:56)
you when is when something is this (78:57 - 79:04)
impacting on your brand saying (79:00 - 79:07)
it's gonna take us three weeks to make a (79:04 - 79:09)
decision (79:07 - 79:12)
is a very it's a very bad look for a (79:09 - 79:13)
company (79:12 - 79:15)
especially since current companies are (79:13 - 79:17)
expected to pivot or die (79:15 - 79:21)
you turn on a dime or you're left behind (79:17 - 79:23)
and they are playing off the fact that (79:21 - 79:24)
they are uh (79:23 - 79:26)
a huge gorilla and there's not a lot of (79:24 - 79:29)
other things that sort of (79:26 - 79:32)
threaten them really um to say well (79:29 - 79:34)
we'll just take our time and we'll get (79:32 - 79:35)
it to you when it (79:34 - 79:37)
meets our schedule it is a kind of (79:35 - 79:39)
dismissive (79:37 - 79:42)
uh ploy (79:39 - 79:45)
to downplay urgency to give them plenty (79:42 - 79:46)
of time (79:45 - 79:50)
to come up with a well-crafted statement (79:46 - 79:52)
which you are clearly are not capable of (79:50 - 79:56)
doing uh so i i mean i can see where (79:52 - 79:56)
like (79:56 - 79:59)
yeah you all have been giving the (79:56 - 79:59)
feedback (79:59 - 80:02)
but they also have to make an internal (79:59 - 80:03)
decision (80:02 - 80:06)
what september first is like a thousand (80:03 - 80:09)
years from now and it it it speaks to (80:06 - 80:11)
we're hoping that these other events (80:09 - 80:13)
will distract you enough (80:11 - 80:16)
that you'll have lessened your (80:13 - 80:18)
angst about it so the decision that we (80:16 - 80:19)
finally make (80:18 - 80:23)
uh it won't be so emotional uh (80:19 - 80:25)
it won't have such emotional resonance (80:23 - 80:26)
because there's been a huge time frame (80:25 - 80:27)
for you to (80:26 - 80:28)
have to settle down a little bit it (80:27 - 80:30)
didn't work (80:28 - 80:32)
i have a different perspective uh than (80:30 - 80:34)
greg (80:32 - 80:37)
um so my take on cross-functional team (80:34 - 80:40)
is they're going to have somebody (80:37 - 80:43)
from their financial group somebody from (80:40 - 80:44)
their programming group (80:43 - 80:45)
somebody from their marketing group (80:44 - 80:47)
somebody from their customer relations (80:45 - 80:49)
group which would be the people that are (80:47 - 80:50)
talking to you (80:49 - 80:52)
steve they're gonna get them all in a (80:50 - 80:53)
room together (80:52 - 80:57)
and say what can we do now i can see (80:53 - 80:59)
targeting it towards the september first (80:57 - 81:01)
season change (80:59 - 81:04)
because that is a massive code update (81:01 - 81:08)
so they can get it into that cycle of (81:04 - 81:09)
when we're going to release (81:08 - 81:11)
an updated code and make that part of (81:09 - 81:13)
those changes rather than doing it as a (81:11 - 81:14)
one-off change (81:13 - 81:16)
that's then going to disrupt things down (81:14 - 81:17)
the line i (81:16 - 81:20)
i would agree with that but they state (81:17 - 81:21)
we will share the (81:20 - 81:23)
findings of this task force on september (81:21 - 81:24)
1st (81:23 - 81:27)
so if they want to try to see anything (81:24 - 81:28)
they're never going to change anything (81:27 - 81:30)
until the next season probably when they (81:28 - 81:31)
change the code again (81:30 - 81:33)
which is which is just saying we're (81:31 - 81:34)
going to tell you what we're going to do (81:33 - 81:36)
with the game changes (81:34 - 81:38)
and then we may implement something like (81:36 - 81:39)
it is a very (81:38 - 81:42)
weak statement but but i mean the the (81:39 - 81:43)
three key things that are going to be (81:42 - 81:44)
discussed (81:43 - 81:47)
are one how much money are we going to (81:44 - 81:48)
lose (81:47 - 81:51)
if we do this versus how many of the (81:48 - 81:52)
customers that we care about (81:51 - 81:55)
are we going to lose if we do this (81:52 - 81:56)
versus (81:55 - 81:59)
what is the risk of breaking the game if (81:56 - 82:00)
we make these changes (81:59 - 82:02)
for things that we expect to do down the (82:00 - 82:04)
line in the future (82:02 - 82:05)
those are the three things that they (82:04 - 82:06)
have to end whichever is the most (82:05 - 82:08)
impactful is the one that's going to (82:06 - 82:10)
make the decision (82:08 - 82:14)
so two things one (82:10 - 82:15)
i guess i give them the benefit of the (82:14 - 82:17)
doubt because they have to go to the (82:15 - 82:19)
pokemon company (82:17 - 82:22)
so if like i if they (82:19 - 82:24)
if they put this on their website and (82:22 - 82:26)
not on pokemon go live even though this (82:24 - 82:28)
is literally talking to only pokemon go (82:26 - 82:29)
players (82:28 - 82:31)
it it just makes it seem like maybe the (82:29 - 82:32)
pokemon company (82:31 - 82:35)
company itself who has to approve what (82:32 - 82:35)
they do (82:35 - 82:39)
maybe they're being maybe they're being (82:35 - 82:41)
hard to work with and maybe niantic is (82:39 - 82:44)
telling themselves they need time (82:41 - 82:46)
to work with the pokemon company and (82:44 - 82:47)
there's language barriers there (82:46 - 82:50)
there's time zone differences we've (82:47 - 82:52)
known in the last five years (82:50 - 82:55)
anything they do has never been fast i (82:52 - 82:59)
i work for a multinational company (82:55 - 83:03)
i know if it is incredibly important (82:59 - 83:06)
and customer impacting it doesn't (83:03 - 83:08)
matter what time zone it is you are (83:06 - 83:10)
forced to get up at a 3 am call because (83:08 - 83:12)
you are a multinational company (83:10 - 83:15)
i agree high up and so to say that oh (83:12 - 83:17)
it's because they have to work (83:15 - 83:19)
multinationally is a cop-out that (83:17 - 83:21)
doesn't exist (83:19 - 83:22)
it is something that people think oh (83:21 - 83:24)
it's got to be hard and there's (83:22 - 83:27)
translation issues literally every large (83:24 - 83:29)
company that deals with working in the (83:27 - 83:30)
world (83:29 - 83:33)
has to do this this is why going into (83:30 - 83:33)
languages (83:33 - 83:36)
is very important it's why having people (83:33 - 83:36)
who can speak (83:36 - 83:39)
both languages is incredibly important (83:36 - 83:40)
it's so that you can respond (83:39 - 83:44)
to market changes and switch and it is a (83:40 - 83:44)
signal (83:44 - 83:47)
of their reluctance and reliance on (83:44 - 83:49)
people thinking oh the pokemon company (83:47 - 83:50)
controls all these things and it must be (83:49 - 83:52)
so hard to talk to them (83:50 - 83:54)
because i certainly don't speak japanese (83:52 - 83:55)
that is (83:54 - 83:58)
that is not true if that is true for (83:55 - 83:59)
your company (83:58 - 84:01)
you need to fix your company (83:59 - 84:03)
foundationally i don't think it's (84:01 - 84:05)
if you can't language that is hard i (84:03 - 84:06)
think it's just (84:05 - 84:09)
they're difficult to work with but even (84:06 - 84:09)
then (84:09 - 84:13)
pokemon company also can't is also can't (84:09 - 84:14)
just be like well we'll just take our (84:13 - 84:15)
time (84:14 - 84:17)
like these are things they can i mean (84:15 - 84:19)
they can but these are things that start (84:17 - 84:21)
to ruin their brand right like (84:19 - 84:24)
these are things that begin to tick away (84:21 - 84:26)
on people's reliance of them (84:24 - 84:29)
and it is it is a bad (84:26 - 84:33)
look to to not be able to (84:29 - 84:36)
pivot it is a bad look in in the face of (84:33 - 84:38)
a global crisis (84:36 - 84:41)
to say it's going to take us weeks (84:38 - 84:44)
to figure something out because (84:41 - 84:48)
weeks we don't have weeks (84:44 - 84:50)
really we are in a very bad situation (84:48 - 84:51)
right now (84:50 - 84:54)
and in an exponentially growing thing if (84:51 - 84:56)
you are giving off the message (84:54 - 84:58)
that these actions are fine when they (84:56 - 84:59)
really aren't (84:58 - 85:00)
and out of the other side of your mouth (84:59 - 85:02)
saying we really care about your health (85:00 - 85:03)
and safety (85:02 - 85:07)
they don't align yes and your brand gets (85:03 - 85:08)
damaged and people think well (85:07 - 85:12)
what are you bad at are you lying (85:08 - 85:17)
or are you just bad at being a company (85:12 - 85:19)
clearly like customers two days before (85:17 - 85:21)
go fest new zealand had like a 24-hour (85:19 - 85:22)
lockdown because they had a (85:21 - 85:25)
case so to be like we're (85:22 - 85:27)
we care about your health but in new (85:25 - 85:29)
zealand it's fine (85:27 - 85:31)
but it's like it's not new zealand's not (85:29 - 85:33)
fine they've had like three lockdowns in (85:31 - 85:34)
july (85:33 - 85:36)
and luckily enough they've been short (85:34 - 85:39)
lockdowns but (85:36 - 85:39)
second thing is (85:40 - 85:44)
i lost my train of thought uh for the (85:44 - 85:48)
second thing but the first thing was (85:46 - 85:51)
okay so (85:48 - 85:51)
the part about like bringing new people (85:51 - 85:55)
in to evaluate (85:54 - 85:59)
and stuff that bothered me the thing (85:55 - 85:59)
that like (85:59 - 86:01)
doesn't bother me probably as much as (85:59 - 86:05)
other people is the distance itself (86:01 - 86:08)
like if everything was fine if i could (86:05 - 86:10)
if i could book a trip to japan next (86:08 - 86:10)
week (86:10 - 86:14)
if i could buy tickets to well i guess (86:10 - 86:15)
technically i could buy tickets to packs (86:14 - 86:17)
but i have no interest in doing that (86:15 - 86:21)
greg canceled his gen con stuff (86:17 - 86:21)
if things were normal (86:21 - 86:28)
and i think we all want normal (86:25 - 86:31)
i i don't think people would be as upset (86:28 - 86:32)
but i'm not even (86:31 - 86:34)
like upset about the distance i gave (86:32 - 86:35)
that situation earlier about being (86:34 - 86:36)
inconvenienced (86:35 - 86:38)
and like at the end of the day it's (86:36 - 86:39)
really not that big of a deal because (86:38 - 86:41)
it's just a single palchio raid it's (86:39 - 86:42)
like (86:41 - 86:45)
whatever the thing that bothers me is (86:42 - 86:46)
just their (86:45 - 86:48)
like it's just the communication it's (86:46 - 86:51)
just five years of them taking (86:48 - 86:57)
weeks or or a month to change something (86:51 - 87:00)
or not telling us like i can just think (86:57 - 87:02)
of so many situations where it's like (87:00 - 87:05)
well jeez why didn't you say this or why (87:02 - 87:06)
is it (87:05 - 87:09)
you turn gimbal shiny and it's been (87:06 - 87:10)
shiny for a week but you didn't tell us (87:09 - 87:14)
like like again i understand that you (87:10 - 87:16)
need approval from the pokemon company (87:14 - 87:18)
i'm just gonna assume that they're hard (87:16 - 87:20)
to work with maybe (87:18 - 87:22)
they don't know how to check email (87:20 - 87:23)
quickly i (87:22 - 87:26)
i don't know what's happening over there (87:23 - 87:27)
i don't know if (87:26 - 87:29)
if the pokemon company i don't know if (87:27 - 87:31)
it's your fault and the pokemon company (87:29 - 87:32)
needs to be stricter (87:31 - 87:34)
i don't know if the pokemon company is (87:32 - 87:36)
too strict and they need to like just (87:34 - 87:39)
trust you in making decisions i we we (87:36 - 87:42)
know that that partnership exists (87:39 - 87:45)
and i get it in a business sense (87:42 - 87:47)
niantic's never going to throw the (87:45 - 87:48)
pokemon company under the bus even (87:47 - 87:49)
though it could be them (87:48 - 87:51)
the pokemon company is never going to (87:49 - 87:53)
throw niantic under the bus even though (87:51 - 87:54)
it could be them (87:53 - 87:57)
my second point was we don't know (87:54 - 88:00)
how much glue pokemon go is held (87:57 - 88:02)
together with (88:00 - 88:05)
like in a really good example is (88:02 - 88:08)
there was a balance update in unite they (88:05 - 88:11)
fixed the amount of damage that sludge (88:08 - 88:13)
bomb hex did (88:11 - 88:15)
and then after that update we found out (88:13 - 88:16)
that hex (88:15 - 88:19)
ended up being broken they quickly fixed (88:16 - 88:20)
hex (88:19 - 88:21)
like it took them what three four days (88:20 - 88:24)
to fix hex now all of a sudden garchomp (88:21 - 88:25)
is broken (88:24 - 88:27)
and garchomp is like unplayable and (88:25 - 88:29)
unite so i (88:27 - 88:32)
i get it maybe your game is so (88:29 - 88:35)
broken on the back end that you do need (88:32 - 88:36)
three weeks (88:35 - 88:39)
to figure this all out maybe (88:36 - 88:43)
who knows want (88:39 - 88:46)
i i am so frustrated with niantic i want (88:43 - 88:49)
to give them the benefit of the doubt (88:46 - 88:52)
that again to me it's not even the (88:49 - 88:53)
distance (88:52 - 88:56)
i just want them to like if it takes you (88:53 - 88:57)
three weeks (88:56 - 88:59)
to come up with a better way to (88:57 - 89:01)
communicate to us (88:59 - 89:03)
a more efficient way to communicate to (89:01 - 89:04)
us (89:03 - 89:08)
and going forward you're like this is (89:04 - 89:09)
our new initiative of (89:08 - 89:11)
how we talk to people how we get (89:09 - 89:12)
messages out there (89:11 - 89:15)
the pokemon company or whatever has (89:12 - 89:16)
approved that this is how we can (89:15 - 89:18)
communicate going forward (89:16 - 89:22)
that is what i want i want them to just (89:18 - 89:26)
figure their stuff out and then like (89:22 - 89:28)
it's almost like we're going to couples (89:26 - 89:29)
therapy with niantic (89:28 - 89:32)
like you have issues and we have issues (89:29 - 89:32)
and (89:32 - 89:34)
it's going to take time but we're going (89:32 - 89:36)
to we're going to set aside (89:34 - 89:38)
every bad experience here we're going to (89:36 - 89:39)
start fresh (89:38 - 89:42)
on september 1st and we're going to save (89:39 - 89:43)
this marriage (89:42 - 89:46)
the marriage of my wallet to you to get (89:43 - 89:48)
slightly different color pokemon (89:46 - 89:53)
like i am optimistic about that (89:48 - 89:53)
and if it takes three weeks for us to (89:53 - 89:58)
get to there (89:57 - 90:01)
cool what i don't actually think and i (89:58 - 90:04)
tweeted this (90:01 - 90:04)
would it be nice and would it solve (90:04 - 90:07)
problems (90:06 - 90:11)
now to flip that switch yes (90:07 - 90:14)
but i don't think that is the actual (90:11 - 90:14)
issue (90:14 - 90:18)
like every single year after go fest (90:14 - 90:20)
ever we always come out of gofest being (90:18 - 90:21)
like gofest was incredible (90:20 - 90:23)
and then there's this huge issue we (90:21 - 90:27)
focus on it's been five years of this (90:23 - 90:31)
and so yeah them flipping the switch (90:27 - 90:33)
it just gives in to all the people (90:31 - 90:35)
complaining and their valid complaints (90:33 - 90:38)
but what then stops those people from (90:35 - 90:39)
doing that the next month what's our (90:38 - 90:41)
next issue that we're all going to band (90:39 - 90:42)
together (90:41 - 90:44)
and complain what's our next issue that (90:42 - 90:46)
we're going to do i think there is (90:44 - 90:48)
some balance of like well we can't (90:46 - 90:49)
completely get in (90:48 - 90:51)
but also we've been messing up for five (90:49 - 90:55)
years i don't know what that looks like (90:51 - 90:55)
but it but like i i (90:55 - 91:00)
think that the issue isn't necessarily (91:01 - 91:08)
the distance although that is an issue (91:05 - 91:12)
the actual issue is their communication (91:08 - 91:12)
so you know people at the harvard (91:13 - 91:16)
business school (91:15 - 91:19)
call them up tell them they need to do a (91:16 - 91:20)
white paper nobody can say no to the (91:19 - 91:21)
harvard business (91:20 - 91:23)
yeah tell them they have to do a white (91:21 - 91:25)
paper on niantic (91:23 - 91:27)
then we will get our answers i i the the (91:25 - 91:30)
only thing i take (91:27 - 91:33)
umbrage with your example is if your (91:30 - 91:34)
community (91:33 - 91:36)
your customer base comes together and (91:34 - 91:38)
says (91:36 - 91:40)
this is an issue in your game and it is (91:38 - 91:42)
stopping us from playing (91:40 - 91:44)
the way you present that is like well (91:42 - 91:46)
the company should just ignore them (91:44 - 91:49)
that is not a good situation like if (91:46 - 91:51)
there was a universal thing (91:49 - 91:53)
where people actually said this is (91:51 - 91:54)
making things unsafe (91:53 - 91:58)
in this game and then we got that fixed (91:54 - 92:00)
and then they said okay now this next (91:58 - 92:02)
thing is also something that's (92:00 - 92:03)
unsafe in your game or it's making it (92:02 - 92:05)
difficult to play your game (92:03 - 92:07)
like that is all feedback from your (92:05 - 92:08)
actual customer base (92:07 - 92:10)
these are the people that use your (92:08 - 92:12)
product and you should perhaps listen to (92:10 - 92:13)
them (92:12 - 92:16)
and if it is not possible or there is a (92:13 - 92:17)
valid reason why you're not going to do (92:16 - 92:18)
it (92:17 - 92:21)
communicate that back but you saying (92:18 - 92:23)
then what's the next thing they're going (92:21 - 92:24)
to have to be fixed (92:23 - 92:27)
where are the people playing your game (92:24 - 92:28)
like we are the ones that are giving you (92:27 - 92:29)
feedback (92:28 - 92:31)
about this product if all of milwaukee (92:29 - 92:33)
went down and all of milwaukee said we (92:31 - 92:35)
can't use our cell phones (92:33 - 92:37)
i'm not going to say at t don't fix (92:35 - 92:38)
milwaukee because then what are we going (92:37 - 92:40)
to have to fix next (92:38 - 92:42)
let milwaukee die without any (92:40 - 92:44)
telecommunications i mean it's just (92:42 - 92:45)
milwaukee it's just milwaukee (92:44 - 92:48)
milwaukee it's just this core group of (92:45 - 92:48)
people who (92:48 - 92:52)
pay us lots of money who actually are (92:48 - 92:54)
helping us spread the word of this game (92:52 - 92:55)
and giving us free advertising (92:54 - 92:58)
let them rot on the vine because our (92:55 - 92:59)
principles are more important (92:58 - 93:02)
that is not a good look for any cut i (92:59 - 93:02)
don't think it's (93:02 - 93:04)
our principles are more important i (93:02 - 93:06)
think that's the bait and switch (93:04 - 93:08)
what it is is we're not going to (93:06 - 93:10)
actually lose any money if we don't (93:08 - 93:10)
change (93:10 - 93:13)
anything i think the the only thing that (93:10 - 93:15)
i would say is they made so much money (93:13 - 93:17)
during a pandemic with these things in (93:15 - 93:17)
place (93:17 - 93:21)
it seems inconceivable that you would (93:17 - 93:23)
decide to jeopardize that by actively (93:21 - 93:27)
angering your customer base (93:23 - 93:29)
yeah again i just think that like if (93:27 - 93:31)
everything was perfect and they did this (93:29 - 93:33)
it wouldn't have been that big of a deal (93:31 - 93:35)
but they shouldn't have gotten to the (93:33 - 93:35)
point (93:35 - 93:36)
they shouldn't have gotten to the point (93:35 - 93:40)
where they just let this flip (93:36 - 93:43)
this lay they let this switch flip (93:40 - 93:45)
because again like you said greg they (93:43 - 93:46)
start off saying we care about your (93:45 - 93:48)
health and safety (93:46 - 93:51)
and we want players to play safely i i (93:48 - 93:52)
get it like if (93:51 - 93:57)
we could not worry about wearing masks (93:52 - 93:58)
and not worry about sanitizing well you (93:57 - 93:59)
should probably all be (93:58 - 94:00)
always washing your hands i mean the (93:59 - 94:01)
person that just said you're not washing (94:00 - 94:03)
your hands to eat oreos (94:01 - 94:06)
so don't even come at me with you like (94:03 - 94:07)
if if (94:06 - 94:08)
everything was perfect and i could (94:07 - 94:11)
travel to france right now (94:08 - 94:13)
i don't think it would have been that (94:11 - 94:14)
big of a deal (94:13 - 94:16)
but because things have gotten worse (94:14 - 94:18)
since the 4th of july (94:16 - 94:19)
you can't say you're monitoring the (94:18 - 94:21)
situation (94:19 - 94:25)
and then just leave it so again i (94:21 - 94:28)
i'm frustrated i am hoping for three (94:25 - 94:29)
weeks (94:28 - 94:31)
the distance change doesn't negate the (94:29 - 94:32)
things that you say (94:31 - 94:34)
you're there for that's the other part (94:32 - 94:36)
that's super wild about their statement (94:34 - 94:37)
like (94:36 - 94:40)
you haven't proven that dropping it (94:37 - 94:43)
from 80 meters to 40 meters does (94:40 - 94:45)
anything that you have stated that it (94:43 - 94:48)
does (94:45 - 94:52)
it just made it safer in a lot of cases (94:48 - 94:55)
and to drop it doesn't you have not ever (94:52 - 94:56)
stated what the benefits (94:55 - 95:00)
are other than we think you would meet (94:56 - 95:02)
more people that way (95:00 - 95:04)
the benefits are that more people pay (95:02 - 95:06)
for remote raid passes (95:04 - 95:08)
and they get money i mean that's that's (95:06 - 95:09)
sort of the negative view (95:08 - 95:11)
and i i don't even remember if we said (95:09 - 95:12)
this on this program i've talked about (95:11 - 95:15)
this on twitch (95:12 - 95:19)
but like the the other issue is (95:15 - 95:23)
you they seem to punish (95:19 - 95:27)
all of us instead of (95:23 - 95:29)
rewarding oh they they have a very set (95:27 - 95:31)
way of playing their game (95:29 - 95:32)
and i respect that and i've said this on (95:31 - 95:34)
the show before their game (95:32 - 95:38)
is about going outside and walking (95:34 - 95:41)
and that is a unique thing to their game (95:38 - 95:43)
and it's a thing that makes their game (95:41 - 95:46)
fun it's a thing i personally enjoy (95:43 - 95:48)
i if you're in a wheelchair if if you're (95:46 - 95:50)
bedridden if you're on crutches (95:48 - 95:52)
obviously you can't do the walking part (95:50 - 95:54)
i get that (95:52 - 95:55)
you also probably can't play dance dance (95:54 - 95:57)
revolution or (95:55 - 95:59)
or all these other games i get that just (95:57 - 96:00)
just to just (95:59 - 96:03)
add on that if you're mobility impaired (96:00 - 96:03)
i (96:03 - 96:07)
i suspect very few mobility impaired (96:03 - 96:08)
people (96:07 - 96:10)
started playing last year because of (96:08 - 96:12)
these changes (96:10 - 96:13)
right they started playing because it (96:12 - 96:15)
was easier for them to play i i don't (96:13 - 96:17)
think that happened (96:15 - 96:20)
i think that did happen yeah i want to (96:17 - 96:22)
see the numbers on that (96:20 - 96:24)
i think i think i think more people (96:22 - 96:25)
started playing at home because (96:24 - 96:29)
they did make it easier to play at home (96:25 - 96:29)
that's why their sales their numbers (96:30 - 96:33)
were so high (96:32 - 96:36)
because it's like oh i'm i can't leave (96:33 - 96:37)
my house but i can reach a pokestop or (96:36 - 96:39)
there's really good spawns here or an (96:37 - 96:40)
incense actually works for the first (96:39 - 96:42)
time (96:40 - 96:46)
what was i saying okay yeah so i (96:42 - 96:49)
i have a respect for games that stick to (96:46 - 96:51)
what they want their game to be (96:49 - 96:53)
they want the niantic has been very (96:51 - 96:55)
clear they want their game to be (96:53 - 96:58)
go outside and walk and i i (96:55 - 97:02)
i that's why i let go i've said before i (96:58 - 97:03)
don't like sitting in a car driving to (97:02 - 97:05)
stop to stop that's not fun to me (97:03 - 97:07)
obviously you could play that way (97:05 - 97:10)
not the way i like to play it and (97:07 - 97:12)
when i am at home i always just think to (97:10 - 97:13)
myself (97:12 - 97:15)
there's better games i can play on my (97:13 - 97:16)
couch that (97:15 - 97:19)
isn't go like i sincerely think go is (97:16 - 97:20)
kind of a bad game when you're sitting (97:19 - 97:22)
at home and playing that being said (97:20 - 97:24)
there are people who like to sit at home (97:22 - 97:25)
and play go (97:24 - 97:27)
i i just think there are better games i (97:25 - 97:29)
would just rather play sword and shield (97:27 - 97:30)
or apex legends or pokemon unite or (97:29 - 97:32)
pokemon snap or like literally any game (97:30 - 97:34)
that doesn't involve me walking outside (97:32 - 97:35)
i can play at home (97:34 - 97:37)
that's my rant but if pokemon go is your (97:35 - 97:39)
favorite game and you love playing on (97:37 - 97:39)
the couch (97:39 - 97:43)
more power to you that being said we're (97:39 - 97:44)
all getting punished (97:43 - 97:46)
because niantic doesn't like people (97:44 - 97:47)
playing on the couch (97:46 - 97:50)
which is fine they made a game they want (97:47 - 97:51)
people to play (97:50 - 97:53)
the game the way but instead of (97:51 - 97:55)
punishing everyone (97:53 - 97:58)
give me more rewards for playing the (97:55 - 97:59)
game how you (97:58 - 98:02)
want me to play it and the biggest thing (97:59 - 98:06)
i can think of is the your game is about (98:02 - 98:09)
walking i like to walk i've been (98:06 - 98:10)
streaming a lot of go on twitch (98:09 - 98:13)
i let me tell you we're walking like 12 (98:10 - 98:15)
miles a day when we're doing that (98:13 - 98:17)
and it's awesome like i feel good after (98:15 - 98:19)
it i'm covered in sweat (98:17 - 98:23)
it's like it's a great time (98:19 - 98:24)
sometimes you gotta work off some (98:23 - 98:26)
calories greg (98:24 - 98:28)
no that's the whole concept of you (98:26 - 98:29)
covered in sweat that's (98:28 - 98:32)
just gross that's why i'm not a sweat (98:29 - 98:33)
person (98:32 - 98:36)
why is it that if i walk 50 kilometers (98:33 - 98:38)
in a week which is their top reward (98:36 - 98:41)
i get like nothing for it i get like one (98:38 - 98:42)
10k (98:41 - 98:45)
egg if i have the room to hold the 10k (98:42 - 98:48)
egg i get some stardust which like (98:45 - 98:50)
doesn't even matter when it comes to (98:48 - 98:52)
like a stardust event i get like 40 (98:50 - 98:54)
pokeballs okay look i'm walking 50 (98:52 - 98:55)
kilometers this week (98:54 - 98:59)
pokeballs ain't my ain't my problem like (98:55 - 99:01)
reward us for playing your game the way (98:59 - 99:03)
you want us to play it (99:01 - 99:05)
if i'm walking 50 kilometers give me (99:03 - 99:06)
something good (99:05 - 99:11)
like give give the people on a couch (99:06 - 99:13)
a reason to be jealous of the people (99:11 - 99:15)
walking (99:13 - 99:18)
like why are your rewards so bad for the (99:15 - 99:20)
people who are out there in the sun (99:18 - 99:21)
sweating the people who are seeing new (99:20 - 99:23)
stops the people who are putting in the (99:21 - 99:26)
the like it's all bad like reward (99:23 - 99:28)
your players that are not on the couch (99:26 - 99:30)
instead of punishing everyone (99:28 - 99:33)
here's the problem the people who are (99:30 - 99:35)
walking the walkie players (99:33 - 99:37)
are also the people who are willing to (99:35 - 99:38)
put money into the game (99:37 - 99:41)
the couch players are not willing to put (99:38 - 99:42)
money into the game (99:41 - 99:43)
i think the couch players are willing to (99:42 - 99:45)
pull money though they're the ones that (99:43 - 99:45)
are (99:45 - 99:47)
they're the ones that are doing incense (99:45 - 99:49)
and not leaving their house (99:47 - 99:50)
like think of how many people in the (99:49 - 99:53)
last year of this pandemic (99:50 - 99:56)
did not go out for go fest or sorry did (99:53 - 99:57)
not go out for community days (99:56 - 99:59)
not because it wasn't safe in their area (99:57 - 100:01)
it has been pretty safe to go outside at (99:59 - 100:01)
a park (100:01 - 100:06)
and play versus you know going inside (100:01 - 100:07)
but think of how many people just didn't (100:06 - 100:09)
leave community leave their house for (100:07 - 100:11)
community because they could just pop in (100:09 - 100:12)
incense catch three shinies in an hour (100:11 - 100:13)
and i don't know (100:12 - 100:15)
what those numbers are i i want to see (100:13 - 100:17)
the the calculations i want to see the (100:15 - 100:20)
graphs the charts (100:17 - 100:20)
like make incense better for people (100:21 - 100:24)
walking (100:23 - 100:28)
make the 25k a week (100:24 - 100:31)
the 50k a week introduce 100k a week (100:28 - 100:31)
like make (100:31 - 100:33)
all of these rewards better because if (100:31 - 100:35)
somebody wants to sit at home and get 0 (100:33 - 100:37)
or 3k because they're sitting at home (100:35 - 100:40)
but they're playing your game (100:37 - 100:40)
why do i feel like me playing your game (100:41 - 100:44)
properly (100:43 - 100:46)
i'm doing air quotes for the audio (100:44 - 100:47)
version (100:46 - 100:49)
why am i why do i feel like i'm still (100:47 - 100:50)
not getting like (100:49 - 100:53)
anything for playing your game right (100:50 - 100:54)
like hey niantic (100:53 - 100:56)
i don't care that you change it from 80 (100:54 - 101:00)
to 40. i'm out here but also (100:56 - 101:00)
if this is how we're playing why why am (101:00 - 101:05)
i still feel like i'm getting punished (101:03 - 101:06)
when i'm playing it the way you want me (101:05 - 101:08)
to play it you're getting the pleasure (101:06 - 101:09)
of being outdoors (101:08 - 101:12)
and enjoying your environment and i like (101:09 - 101:12)
that go (101:12 - 101:20)
takes me outside i really do but (101:12 - 101:20)
the the game had (101:20 - 101:24)
it i don't know i'm shrugging my (101:24 - 101:28)
shoulders (101:26 - 101:30)
i like this game a lot i really do it's (101:28 - 101:31)
it's (101:30 - 101:34)
like (101:31 - 101:34)
probably top three all-time pokemon (101:34 - 101:38)
games for me (101:37 - 101:40)
i've been playing it for five years i (101:38 - 101:42)
love it (101:40 - 101:44)
i i would like to play it for another (101:42 - 101:46)
five years (101:44 - 101:49)
oh you will you will (101:46 - 101:52)
but i i personally have a problem with (101:49 - 101:52)
okay (101:52 - 101:54)
if you're if if you want us to play the (101:52 - 101:56)
game the way you want us to play it (101:54 - 101:58)
why why do we why do we just feel like (101:56 - 102:01)
we're still getting punished (101:58 - 102:03)
even though we're because because some (102:01 - 102:04)
people want to play on the couch who (102:03 - 102:05)
cares (102:04 - 102:07)
let them play on the couch if they want (102:05 - 102:08)
to spend 250 every (102:07 - 102:11)
two hours to do three remote raids let (102:08 - 102:13)
them spend the money (102:11 - 102:15)
but i'm out here sweating i'm out here (102:13 - 102:16)
walking i'm out here connecting with (102:15 - 102:17)
people (102:16 - 102:18)
i'm out here spinning your stops i'm out (102:17 - 102:20)
here visiting starbucks which is your (102:18 - 102:21)
sponsor gym (102:20 - 102:24)
and i'm getting one purple egg a week (102:21 - 102:27)
and that's all i'm getting for it geez (102:24 - 102:30)
come on niantic what do you want from me (102:27 - 102:31)
how much more can i do (102:30 - 102:33)
to play your game the way you want me to (102:31 - 102:35)
play it and feel like i'm still getting (102:33 - 102:37)
screwed at the end of the day (102:35 - 102:40)
i don't know it sucks (102:37 - 102:40)
and all the people that are like well (102:42 - 102:47)
stop playing that doesn't matter (102:44 - 102:49)
the only thing that matters is money (102:47 - 102:50)
okay don't give niantic money (102:49 - 102:52)
i don't (102:50 - 102:55)
[Laughter] (102:52 - 102:57)
i've given them a hundred dollars once (102:55 - 102:59)
this year and i've already spent that (102:57 - 102:59)
money (102:59 - 103:01)
so like or not spent that money but it's (102:59 - 103:04)
already converted to coins (103:01 - 103:12)
so i can't i'm not giving them money (103:04 - 103:15)
i hope that september 1st has something (103:12 - 103:17)

probably be the death of me because (105:33 - 105:36)
uh mailing stuff is time consuming but i (105:37 - 105:41)
want to really make these like little (105:39 - 105:43)
packages to you guys like feel special (105:41 - 105:45)
um shirts are normally like 20 bucks (105:43 - 105:47)
looks like free shipping so (105:45 - 105:48)
it's kind of like a wash for me like (105:47 - 105:50)
it's not really a profit but (105:48 - 105:52)
um if you want to get one of these (105:50 - 105:53)
shirts (105:52 - 105:56)
uh it's to anyone at the 25 level uh the (105:53 - 105:58)
reason i'm ending it at august 18th is (105:56 - 105:59)
because then i need to get all the sizes (105:58 - 106:01)
and then we need to send it to pressing (105:59 - 106:02)
so i get the exact amount of shirts and (106:01 - 106:03)
then once they arrive to me i'll start (106:02 - 106:04)
packing them (106:03 - 106:08)
so that's patreon.compmncast (106:04 - 106:10)
and if you sign up you can get the shirt (106:08 - 106:13)
and you can get bonus episodes (106:10 - 106:15)
and let's just spend a little time on (106:13 - 106:16)
unite (106:15 - 106:18)
uh and then we'll do question of the (106:16 - 106:20)
week i know the show's already longer (106:18 - 106:21)
than it should be but i thought the (106:20 - 106:23)
niantic thing was pretty important (106:21 - 106:26)
um so we're like week going into week (106:23 - 106:28)
three of unite (106:26 - 106:30)
i think will's given up on it no i play (106:28 - 106:31)
it every day (106:30 - 106:32)
[Laughter] (106:31 - 106:35)
what do you mean just because i don't (106:32 - 106:36)
play ranked (106:35 - 106:38)
doesn't mean i don't play unite are you (106:36 - 106:40)
still having a good time non-ranked (106:38 - 106:41)
yeah i'd love to get in there with my (106:40 - 106:44)
snorlax (106:41 - 106:46)
did you buy the floatie i have not given (106:44 - 106:48)
that game a cent (106:46 - 106:50)
oh yeah you haven't even done battle (106:48 - 106:53)
pass right correct (106:50 - 106:56)
greg is very into unite which is the (106:53 - 106:56)
shocking (106:56 - 106:59)
reveal why is this shocking you keep (106:56 - 107:00)
saying it's shocking (106:59 - 107:04)
why is this shocking i need you to (107:00 - 107:04)
explain (107:04 - 107:06)
to your knight which means you have to (107:04 - 107:08)
hate unite we don't like (107:06 - 107:09)
greg we just expect you to be a (107:08 - 107:11)
responsible adult not (107:09 - 107:15)
a moba player i am a responsible adult (107:11 - 107:18)
i look there's nothing i think the show (107:15 - 107:19)
has proven greg we (107:18 - 107:21)
never see eye to eye well that's because (107:19 - 107:22)
you're always wrong (107:21 - 107:25)
my like of unite has nothing to do with (107:22 - 107:26)
you (107:25 - 107:28)
dragging me down when you're like carry (107:26 - 107:30)
me and i try and you are (107:28 - 107:33)
such hot garbage we lose are you kidding (107:30 - 107:34)
me (107:33 - 107:38)
no no wait i don't see you at all in any (107:34 - 107:41)
of our games until the last two minutes (107:38 - 107:41)
[Laughter] (107:42 - 107:47)
i believe if okay so i know you don't (107:44 - 107:50)
get mvp a lot because you're a healer (107:47 - 107:52)
but almost every game we've played (107:50 - 107:55)
together greg i am almost always mvp (107:52 - 107:59)
uh i'm not being sarcastic twice twice (107:55 - 108:02)
i don't get mvp except for my amazing (107:59 - 108:03)
mvp (108:02 - 108:05)
last night which is the crowning and (108:03 - 108:07)
unite achievement of my life (108:05 - 108:09)
look we're not here to brag about who's (108:07 - 108:10)
getting mvp and who's not (108:09 - 108:12)
uh can we brag about how i'm a much (108:10 - 108:14)
higher level than you (108:12 - 108:16)
yeah you also probably have like 200 (108:14 - 108:18)
more games than i do (108:16 - 108:20)
how many games do you think you're up to (108:18 - 108:21)
you do it for living i can look because (108:20 - 108:22)
i just had to put it on (108:21 - 108:24)
yeah no like everyone always says this (108:22 - 108:26)
you play pokemon for a living you play (108:24 - 108:27)
pokemon for a living (108:26 - 108:29)
these people in my twitch channel they (108:27 - 108:31)
have like 300 more games than i do (108:29 - 108:32)
because they don't (108:31 - 108:35)
have to like consistently edit or market (108:32 - 108:37)
themselves they just play video games (108:35 - 108:39)
really good full-time job and a (108:37 - 108:40)
part-time job (108:39 - 108:43)
yeah but you have promoting an rpg right (108:40 - 108:45)
how many games you got (108:43 - 108:47)
uh what i have in the spreadsheet is i (108:45 - 108:49)
have played (108:47 - 108:52)
a spreadsheet look at you guys guys have (108:49 - 108:53)
all time (108:52 - 108:55)
little little spreadsheet a hundred (108:53 - 108:57)
spreadsheet what are you using there's (108:55 - 108:58)
no spreadsheet (108:57 - 109:02)
for no way you have 180 games i had 190 (108:58 - 109:04)
games like five days ago (109:02 - 109:06)
maybe i entered it in wrong do you want (109:04 - 109:09)
me to go down and get my thing (109:06 - 109:11)
no we don't have time for this i mean (109:09 - 109:13)
it's just downstairs (109:11 - 109:15)
okay you go get it what are you tracking (109:13 - 109:17)
in the spreadsheet i'll talk (109:15 - 109:18)
about the whole i'll talk about updates (109:17 - 109:20)
all right so they did their first (109:18 - 109:24)
uh balance update which (109:20 - 109:26)
i i was wrong about i didn't think we'd (109:24 - 109:27)
get a balance update (109:26 - 109:29)
for like a month it's been two weeks but (109:27 - 109:31)
they did a balance update they (109:29 - 109:33)
i made a little graphic for it but they (109:31 - 109:34)
took (109:33 - 109:36)
pokemon that weren't really being used (109:34 - 109:38)
like talonflame and they they bumped him (109:36 - 109:38)
up (109:38 - 109:41)
um charizard they bumped him up they (109:38 - 109:42)
left a lot of pokemon alone (109:41 - 109:46)
like nine tails and pikachu um they like (109:42 - 109:48)
kind of nerfed crammer at but (109:46 - 109:50)
like i i've talked to a lot of crimer (109:48 - 109:51)
players including myself it just doesn't (109:50 - 109:54)
feel any different when you say like (109:51 - 109:56)
nerf (109:54 - 109:57)
maybe we should explain this when (109:56 - 109:58)
something gets nerfed it usually means (109:57 - 110:00)
like a stat goes down (109:58 - 110:03)
so in the example does less damage moves (110:00 - 110:04)
less quickly yes (110:03 - 110:07)
so for like cramer ant whirlpool which (110:04 - 110:08)
is it's a movie you only get into level (110:07 - 110:10)
six and then you stop using it it did (110:08 - 110:10)
like (110:10 - 110:13)
4 700 damage and then they changed it to (110:10 - 110:13)
4 (110:13 - 110:16)
300 damage and honestly it's like (110:13 - 110:19)
it's not even noticeable um and then (110:16 - 110:21)
they took some pokemon and they (110:19 - 110:24)
they did so like they took pokemon that (110:21 - 110:26)
were controversial like gengar (110:24 - 110:27)
and i guess this maybe just shows that (110:26 - 110:31)
people don't understand (110:27 - 110:31)
fully what what's going on but they when (110:31 - 110:35)
you look at the little thing i make (110:34 - 110:37)
it gengar has two up arrows and one down (110:35 - 110:39)
arrow up arrows meaning buff down arrow (110:37 - 110:40)
meaning nerf (110:39 - 110:42)
and they took the move that everyone (110:40 - 110:44)
hated hex (110:42 - 110:46)
and they made hex do less damage which (110:44 - 110:48)
is everyone wanted (110:46 - 110:50)
but then it made sense that they buffed (110:48 - 110:52)
the move shadowball (110:50 - 110:54)
because no one used shadowball so you (110:52 - 110:55)
want (110:54 - 110:57)
the tool set on your pokemon to be (110:55 - 110:58)
viable with (110:57 - 111:01)
whichever way they go like if you nerf (110:58 - 111:02)
hex (111:01 - 111:04)
but you don't do anything to shadowball (111:02 - 111:05)
people are still (111:04 - 111:08)
not going to use shadowball right you (111:05 - 111:09)
want both (111:08 - 111:13)
paths to be good and they did that with (111:09 - 111:14)
kramer ant right like no one was really (111:13 - 111:17)
using dive on cramaran so they increased (111:14 - 111:19)
they made dive a little bit stronger (111:17 - 111:22)
um (111:19 - 111:22)
move uh which i would say was the (111:24 - 111:28)
problem with xero aura not really (111:26 - 111:30)
discharged discharge is like (111:28 - 111:33)
yeah it's its main move but you can see (111:30 - 111:34)
it (111:33 - 111:36)
you can walk away from it i mean zera (111:34 - 111:38)
aura is meant to be a (111:36 - 111:40)
very close-up character so if you keep (111:38 - 111:41)
your distance (111:40 - 111:43)
or you wait till discharge is used you (111:41 - 111:44)
can then go in and (111:43 - 111:46)
get sarah aura but yeah they nerfed its (111:44 - 111:49)
unite move which yeah its unite move was (111:46 - 111:51)
very good um (111:49 - 111:52)
[Music] (111:51 - 111:56)
and then with gossip fleur they nerfed (111:52 - 111:58)
um the shields i think it was the (111:56 - 112:00)
shields right but they buffed the ones (111:58 - 112:01)
that people weren't using (112:00 - 112:03)
yeah which i don't know if you've that (112:01 - 112:05)
you've tried those since greg (112:03 - 112:07)
no i still don't use them um i still (112:05 - 112:09)
like i have seen the (112:07 - 112:10)
things like well everybody uses elder (112:09 - 112:12)
goss and i'm like the reason why (112:10 - 112:14)
everybody uses zelda gus is eldergast is (112:12 - 112:16)
literally the only character that does (112:14 - 112:17)
direct healing (112:16 - 112:19)
right so it's really hard to say that (112:17 - 112:20)
elder goss was out (112:19 - 112:24)
of balance (112:20 - 112:27)
healing wise when nobody else heals (112:24 - 112:30)
um the the biggest change is (112:27 - 112:33)
shields used to be on i think it was a (112:30 - 112:35)
five seconds cooldown and it's on a nine (112:33 - 112:39)
second cooldown uh so it's harder to (112:35 - 112:42)
it's harder to recover in emergency (112:39 - 112:43)
situations (112:42 - 112:47)
um but uh i'm (112:43 - 112:49)
i haven't like i still don't think the (112:47 - 112:50)
other two (112:49 - 112:53)
things are have been buffed enough to be (112:50 - 112:55)
worth it like (112:53 - 112:59)
cotton spore requires you to be (112:55 - 113:01)
pretty close to things and i think that (112:59 - 113:02)
was like a (113:01 - 113:04)
five second to a four second yeah it's (113:02 - 113:06)
just it's just not (113:04 - 113:08)
ideal like the minute they see elder (113:06 - 113:09)
goss they go (113:08 - 113:10)
straight for aldegas because they need (113:09 - 113:13)
to kill the healing um and my official (113:10 - 113:15)
games is 283. (113:13 - 113:19)
283 yeah gee i just checked i was at (113:15 - 113:23)
182. you have 100 more battles than me (113:19 - 113:25)
holy cow that's a lot of battles greg (113:23 - 113:27)
what i play the game (113:25 - 113:30)
no it's it's it's it's so weird that i (113:27 - 113:32)
had this disconnect that you weren't a (113:30 - 113:33)
competitive person and then i like (113:32 - 113:36)
erased all the clash royale in my mind (113:33 - 113:37)
where you like (113:36 - 113:40)
okay you pull that from (113:37 - 113:43)
board games in which i don't like being (113:40 - 113:44)
competitive (113:43 - 113:46)
with the people you play board games (113:44 - 113:47)
with and you don't care anything about (113:46 - 113:48)
like competitive and (113:47 - 113:51)
like sword and shield no uh that really (113:48 - 113:53)
stresses me out also because i have a i (113:51 - 113:54)
have i have issues (113:53 - 113:57)
with how the meta is designed like i (113:54 - 113:57)
really have (113:57 - 114:00)
like struggling finding connections to (113:57 - 114:02)
pokemon that are good in metas (114:00 - 114:05)
so it's hard for me to to want to run (114:02 - 114:06)
teams (114:05 - 114:07)
of pokemon that i don't feel a (114:06 - 114:10)
connection to i feel like um (114:07 - 114:12)
so like there are different reasons but (114:10 - 114:13)
yeah like i (114:12 - 114:17)
am so i am a very competitive person (114:13 - 114:17)
which (114:17 - 114:19)
i also need to keep that in check just (114:17 - 114:21)
so that i don't become the person that i (114:19 - 114:22)
hate (114:21 - 114:26)
uh but unite has a (114:22 - 114:29)
as a supporter role i get i still get (114:26 - 114:30)
frustrated (114:29 - 114:34)
but like i am not (114:30 - 114:38)
i unite helps me feel like i'm a part of (114:34 - 114:40)
a team in ways that other competitions (114:38 - 114:44)
don't and that helps me (114:40 - 114:46)
feel like i'm trying to support and go (114:44 - 114:48)
with things as a team (114:46 - 114:51)
uh and the sort of flip-floppy nature of (114:48 - 114:51)
mobas (114:51 - 114:55)
is just you lose a lot (114:51 - 114:57)
right like it's you're just gonna run up (114:55 - 114:59)
to people who (114:57 - 115:02)
just are better all the time um (114:59 - 115:05)
and i've found i found pokemon of a (115:02 - 115:08)
limited roster that i feel connected to (115:05 - 115:11)
that i enjoy playing and it the fact (115:08 - 115:13)
that i can quick jump in and play for 10 (115:11 - 115:16)
minutes and then finish my lunch with a (115:13 - 115:18)
10 minute match and then go back to work (115:16 - 115:23)
is fun for me it's just fun to do and (115:18 - 115:26)
i don't feel unite is so hyper (115:23 - 115:26)
competitive (115:26 - 115:30)
toxic that i feel that toxicity (115:26 - 115:33)
while playing the game yeah i mean (115:30 - 115:35)
you're you're always gonna (115:33 - 115:37)
just run into teams that are better than (115:35 - 115:39)
you um (115:37 - 115:40)
and that that's fine and whether they (115:39 - 115:42)
paid or not is it probably doesn't (115:40 - 115:43)
matter because they're gonna be better (115:42 - 115:45)
than you regardless yeah (115:43 - 115:48)
um or get randomly placed on a team of (115:45 - 115:50)
people who do absolutely nothing (115:48 - 115:53)
yeah i i i still (115:50 - 115:55)
we were we were joking about mvp earlier (115:53 - 115:57)
but i would still (115:55 - 116:02)
prefer to be the worst on the team (115:57 - 116:05)
um because because i (116:02 - 116:08)
know what it feels like to be the worst (116:05 - 116:09)
right like (116:08 - 116:12)
and i think with unite um or any other (116:09 - 116:13)
competitive game (116:12 - 116:17)
like you see like uh you'll see somebody (116:13 - 116:19)
like oh they scored no points (116:17 - 116:21)
or they didn't get any really kill and (116:19 - 116:23)
like like knocking out slash killing (116:21 - 116:24)
whatever you want to call it like it (116:23 - 116:26)
doesn't actually matter in this game (116:24 - 116:27)
like it's not like (116:26 - 116:31)
you getting 13 knockouts look hallelujah (116:27 - 116:33)
say it again the game is not about (116:31 - 116:34)
killing (116:33 - 116:37)
your opponents it's about scoring points (116:34 - 116:40)
right fundamental yeah so it like you (116:37 - 116:42)
can brag that you got 20 kills (116:40 - 116:44)
but like it if you didn't score the (116:42 - 116:46)
points like i think that's also why i (116:44 - 116:50)
enjoy playing elder goss is (116:46 - 116:53)
my job isn't isn't (116:50 - 116:55)
just the score really it is to help (116:53 - 116:57)
create opportunities where others can (116:55 - 116:57)
score (116:57 - 116:59)
and i will say when i see somebody who (116:57 - 117:01)
is supposed to be playing (116:59 - 117:04)
an attacker has zero i'm like (117:01 - 117:07)
what were you doing yeah at all like (117:04 - 117:08)
what (117:07 - 117:10)
did he do the killing doesn't completely (117:08 - 117:12)
matter it doesn't come out it doesn't (117:10 - 117:13)
matter in the scoring instance but (117:12 - 117:14)
obviously if you knock somebody out for (117:13 - 117:15)
30 seconds that's (117:14 - 117:18)
that can be huge but yeah it is making (117:15 - 117:19)
those openings (117:18 - 117:23)
um but what i was what i was saying is (117:19 - 117:24)
like (117:23 - 117:27)
i think even even in a like expert or (117:24 - 117:29)
veteran or something (117:27 - 117:32)
when you you see you were last the team (117:29 - 117:33)
i think (117:32 - 117:35)
it flashes across your mind of like oh (117:33 - 117:37)
i'm the weak link is this why we lost (117:35 - 117:39)
especially if you lose like if you lost (117:37 - 117:41)
and if you were the person with no (117:39 - 117:43)
points on the team or the lowest score (117:41 - 117:44)
you think like (117:43 - 117:47)
oh that is my fault and i would rather (117:44 - 117:48)
be in that position so other people (117:47 - 117:50)
don't feel awful (117:48 - 117:53)
like how can i get everyone (117:50 - 117:55)
up where like okay we lost but it's (117:53 - 117:57)
steve's fault which is like fine (117:55 - 118:00)
so i think i mean i think i think we've (117:57 - 118:01)
been talking to somebody about (118:00 - 118:04)
because i think we've been pretty (118:01 - 118:05)
successful on twitch and greg and i have (118:04 - 118:07)
been playing on twitch together (118:05 - 118:12)
and you know we've lost and we've won um (118:07 - 118:15)
and i and yeah it's like trying not to (118:12 - 118:17)
be toxic or put the blame but when the (118:15 - 118:18)
match is over (118:17 - 118:20)
i do try to explain like okay what went (118:18 - 118:21)
wrong in that match right like (118:20 - 118:23)
and what can we do better and it's not (118:21 - 118:25)
like well (118:23 - 118:27)
we did wrong because greg moved here at (118:25 - 118:29)
four minutes and he should have been (118:27 - 118:30)
here and it's like it's not a blame game (118:29 - 118:31)
it's like (118:30 - 118:34)
i mean i think the one that we messed up (118:31 - 118:36)
the one that i was screaming at the tv (118:34 - 118:38)
was when you all start there's only two (118:36 - 118:39)
of two of you alive and you're attacking (118:38 - 118:40)
zapdos (118:39 - 118:43)
like stop no (118:40 - 118:46)
please stop doing that yeah and that was (118:43 - 118:48)
that was probably the most frustrating (118:46 - 118:52)
part and but that just comes with (118:48 - 118:53)
experience (118:52 - 118:55)
right um because you think like so in (118:53 - 118:56)
the situation (118:55 - 118:59)
we were winning the entire game and it (118:56 - 119:00)
kept saying you have a huge lead you (118:59 - 119:02)
have a huge lead (119:00 - 119:06)
and we all went to zapdos and we hid in (119:02 - 119:08)
the bush (119:06 - 119:09)
like three of us hid in the bush it was (119:08 - 119:12)
great and the team came over (119:09 - 119:14)
and i used my alt somebody else used (119:12 - 119:16)
their alt and we wiped the team (119:14 - 119:20)
but it was they also took (119:16 - 119:22)
a bunch of us out they took out three of (119:20 - 119:23)
you so it was (119:22 - 119:28)
it was me and another person and (119:23 - 119:30)
they started attacking zapdos and i'm i (119:28 - 119:31)
i'm like (119:30 - 119:33)
do we attack it do we not and i didn't (119:31 - 119:35)
attack zapdos because i was pretty weak (119:33 - 119:38)
um and because that person did more than (119:35 - 119:39)
half damage (119:38 - 119:42)
all five of them came in they wiped us (119:39 - 119:42)
two (119:42 - 119:46)
so now it was five verse three (119:42 - 119:48)
because we should have just been hiding (119:46 - 119:50)
in the bush and i was hiding the bush i (119:48 - 119:51)
was just like (119:50 - 119:52)
going back and forth like peeking to see (119:51 - 119:54)
if they were coming (119:52 - 119:57)
and then because they took out half of (119:54 - 119:58)
zapdos health (119:57 - 120:01)
it made it very easy for the team to (119:58 - 120:02)
then finish off zapdos (120:01 - 120:05)
versus right force because that team has (120:02 - 120:06)
to (120:05 - 120:07)
that and this is the thing we have to (120:06 - 120:09)
think about and why i'm explaining it is (120:07 - 120:11)
because i hope it helps our listeners (120:09 - 120:14)
when you're winning so much they (120:11 - 120:18)
have to attack zapdos and if they can't (120:14 - 120:20)
attack zapdos without attacking you (120:18 - 120:23)
they're wasting time and resources (120:20 - 120:27)
on you so the thing about zapdos as well (120:23 - 120:28)
that you just have to think of (120:27 - 120:31)
is zapdos does a lot of damage to (120:28 - 120:35)
you as well like it does like (120:31 - 120:38)
as a crammer ant i cannot solo zapdos (120:35 - 120:40)
as a zero aura i could but zero auras (120:38 - 120:42)
coming out of that less than fifty (120:40 - 120:43)
percent hp (120:42 - 120:47)
um and and really zapdos at full house (120:43 - 120:49)
at 30 seconds less than the game (120:47 - 120:52)
zapdos is no longer time you can't take (120:49 - 120:54)
it out and score (120:52 - 120:56)
a zapdos at full house and then get to (120:54 - 120:57)
the other right like (120:56 - 121:00)
it's effectively done yeah if you have (120:57 - 121:02)
50 sorry well if you have 50 points and (121:00 - 121:03)
there's 10 seconds (121:02 - 121:05)
you cannot score you need you need like (121:03 - 121:07)
12 seconds to score 50 points (121:05 - 121:11)
unless it's like the instant score but (121:07 - 121:14)
too much key zapdos key dreadnough strat (121:11 - 121:17)
only the last hit (121:14 - 121:21)
counts let somebody else (121:17 - 121:24)
take the health down you swoop in (121:21 - 121:26)
get that last hit from them steal it (121:24 - 121:28)
from them i mean the other thing i (121:26 - 121:29)
didn't realize until (121:28 - 121:31)
like i've been playing it a lot now and (121:29 - 121:32)
watching people play is just (121:31 - 121:35)
how much everybody needs to go fight (121:32 - 121:36)
drednah (121:35 - 121:39)
like everybody abandon top lane because (121:36 - 121:40)
the (121:39 - 121:42)
amount of experience and levels you get (121:40 - 121:45)
if your team (121:42 - 121:48)
finishes dreadnaught turns the game and (121:45 - 121:50)
if you can get dreadnought twice in a (121:48 - 121:51)
game (121:50 - 121:53)
you are effectively unstoppable and it (121:51 - 121:55)
doesn't matter if they got one goal up (121:53 - 121:55)
top (121:55 - 121:58)
if one person scored 40 points the fact (121:55 - 122:00)
that your team got dreadna (121:58 - 122:03)
is the most important part of that game (122:00 - 122:05)
it it every time dreadnought appears (122:03 - 122:06)
it's like everybody (122:05 - 122:09)
leave go to dreadnought because it's so (122:06 - 122:10)
important to get this boss (122:09 - 122:13)
i would put an asterisk there with (122:10 - 122:15)
everyone needs to go dreadnaught (122:13 - 122:20)
if you're on top and (122:15 - 122:22)
if you're on top i would say almost one (122:20 - 122:23)
person should always go (122:22 - 122:27)
because there should be two up there if (122:23 - 122:30)
their two are staying it's worth it for (122:27 - 122:31)
one to stay up there (122:30 - 122:34)
just to waste those two time those (122:31 - 122:36)
because then it will be four verse three (122:34 - 122:38)
yeah verses five verse three you're (122:36 - 122:40)
going to win that anyways (122:38 - 122:43)
but you're gonna give them so much to do (122:40 - 122:43)
up there (122:43 - 122:45)
and you have to think about this in the (122:43 - 122:47)
game of what there is to do (122:45 - 122:50)
if they're taking the bees (122:47 - 122:53)
you're not if they're taking the core (122:50 - 122:54)
fish you are not (122:53 - 122:57)
but if you're up there distracting them (122:54 - 122:58)
you're still doing something and you're (122:57 - 123:01)
still being important to the team so (122:58 - 123:03)
i do think dreadnought dreadnought is (123:01 - 123:05)
very important because of the level not (123:03 - 123:07)
necessarily because of the shield (123:05 - 123:10)
so you just attacking a pokemon once (123:07 - 123:11)
when that pokemon is defeated you'll get (123:10 - 123:13)
the experience as long as you get a (123:11 - 123:14)
single hit (123:13 - 123:18)
on it um but yeah if they score a little (123:14 - 123:18)
bit (123:18 - 123:20)
in return for the amount the experience (123:18 - 123:22)
wins the game experience a lot of the (123:20 - 123:22)
game (123:22 - 123:24)
i think a lot of people i think when the (123:22 - 123:25)
first game first came out us included (123:24 - 123:26)
we're like (123:25 - 123:29)
zapdos wins the game that's not true no (123:26 - 123:29)
it's a it's (123:29 - 123:32)
like and and it's funny because a lot of (123:29 - 123:34)
youtubers a lot of content creators a (123:32 - 123:35)
lot of people on twitter (123:34 - 123:37)
they talked about how dreadnought was a (123:35 - 123:38)
waste like (123:37 - 123:41)
go back two weeks ago yeah no one cared (123:38 - 123:42)
about dreadnaught (123:41 - 123:44)
yeah um dreadnought everything the (123:42 - 123:46)
conversation was (123:44 - 123:48)
the conversation was so focused on (123:46 - 123:49)
zapdos (123:48 - 123:52)
which is ironic that like they they (123:49 - 123:53)
spent so much time making these (123:52 - 123:54)
mechanics and (123:53 - 123:56)
it only took a little bit for the meta (123:54 - 123:57)
to start forming (123:56 - 123:59)
but (123:57 - 123:59)
if you're a level nine (124:01 - 124:07)
nine tails and i'm a level seven (124:04 - 124:09)
cramarant (124:07 - 124:12)
i lose purely based on level (124:09 - 124:15)
uh if you're a level 120 aura and i'm a (124:12 - 124:16)
level 10 absol (124:15 - 124:20)
you win that's just what it is and so (124:16 - 124:21)
the reason why dreadnought's so (124:20 - 124:22)
important (124:21 - 124:24)
is because everyone who touches it gets (124:22 - 124:27)
that huge experience you almost go up a (124:24 - 124:28)
full level (124:27 - 124:30)
yeah uh if you were just fresh so (124:28 - 124:31)
rotating down to dreadnought is (124:30 - 124:34)
is very important and like i said should (124:31 - 124:35)
everyone rotate (124:34 - 124:38)
yeah but if they're not rotating if (124:35 - 124:40)
they're not rotating up there it's it's (124:38 - 124:41)
nice to leave a snorlax up there or nine (124:40 - 124:43)
tails up there just to like (124:41 - 124:46)
waste their time and again if if they (124:43 - 124:48)
haven't dropped (124:46 - 124:50)
then read the situation if it's a (124:48 - 124:51)
one-on-one just go (124:50 - 124:53)
if it's a one on two and you can waste (124:51 - 124:55)
your time (124:53 - 124:58)
go but if if if you see everybody as god (124:55 - 124:59)
and you're the only person (124:58 - 125:00)
up there get your butt down to (124:59 - 125:02)
dreadnaught yeah (125:00 - 125:03)
i mean if you're the only person up (125:02 - 125:05)
there and i've had it successful where (125:03 - 125:08)
like i'm the only one up there um (125:05 - 125:09)
because i was either late (125:08 - 125:12)
or i didn't have health so me going down (125:09 - 125:15)
there would have died anyways (125:12 - 125:16)
you can still clear everything up there (125:15 - 125:18)
so by the time they get back up (125:16 - 125:21)
they got nothing to work on which is (125:18 - 125:22)
there's still value there but (125:21 - 125:23)
that's where the communication comes in (125:22 - 125:25)
yeah of like hey i can't join you (125:23 - 125:26)
because (125:25 - 125:29)
i got like 25 health and by the time i (125:26 - 125:30)
get there like (125:29 - 125:33)
there's like four zero down there also (125:30 - 125:34)
if you use your ultimate (125:33 - 125:37)
wrong uh just kill something for two (125:34 - 125:38)
points and score (125:37 - 125:41)
because every score no matter how small (125:38 - 125:42)
increases your (125:41 - 125:46)
reset 10 percent so just if you like oop (125:42 - 125:48)
i need my ultimate faster (125:46 - 125:50)
just kill something quick and scoot over (125:48 - 125:52)
you can probably get a two score in (125:50 - 125:55)
and you still get that 10 boost on your (125:52 - 125:56)
ultimate coming back (125:55 - 125:58)
every time you score and you get four (125:56 - 126:00)
percent for killing wild i think (125:58 - 126:04)
so like it is useful to make small (126:00 - 126:04)
scores (126:04 - 126:08)
if your ultimate is vital or going to be (126:04 - 126:10)
super helpful in one of the two boss (126:08 - 126:11)
fights (126:10 - 126:13)
like th there's these little tiny things (126:11 - 126:14)
that you can do to (126:13 - 126:17)
improve your game and like yeah a two (126:14 - 126:18)
score (126:17 - 126:20)
isn't going to move the points but it's (126:18 - 126:23)
going to get you back to things that you (126:20 - 126:24)
need (126:23 - 126:25)
should you have made a mistake earlier (126:24 - 126:28)
or or used it wisely and you just know (126:25 - 126:29)
you're going to need it again (126:28 - 126:32)
like zip over hit hit a two point (126:29 - 126:34)
and get up because the two point is (126:32 - 126:35)
almost instantaneous (126:34 - 126:37)
and it you can kill something small (126:35 - 126:39)
pretty quick and get in there and do it (126:37 - 126:42)
um it's just ways to sort of like use (126:39 - 126:44)
like as we are beginning to learn these (126:42 - 126:46)
mechanics to like be better at the game (126:44 - 126:47)
there's these little things that are (126:46 - 126:49)
very helpful (126:47 - 126:51)
yeah and that's what i'm trying to do (126:49 - 126:53)
with like the graphics and the twitch (126:51 - 126:53)
stuff is just (126:53 - 126:56)
you know help people because once once (126:53 - 126:59)
you understand and enjoy what you're (126:56 - 127:01)
playing it makes the game easier and (126:59 - 127:02)
makes the game less frustrating (127:01 - 127:04)
instead of like somebody in my like (127:02 - 127:06)
twitch chat that was just like (127:04 - 127:08)
oh i just go anywhere and we seem to win (127:06 - 127:09)
that's like yeah (127:08 - 127:12)
yeah although it violates stay that way (127:09 - 127:15)
right i have three rules of what makes a (127:12 - 127:16)
video game that i enjoy (127:15 - 127:18)
i have some rules of what makes a video (127:16 - 127:20)
game that i won't enjoy and (127:18 - 127:22)
having to do homework for the video game (127:20 - 127:24)
is a on that list of (127:22 - 127:27)
things i do not enjoy yeah (127:24 - 127:28)
i i and i think for the most part in (127:27 - 127:31)
unite you don't have to do homework (127:28 - 127:34)
if you baloney i've got to go to your (127:31 - 127:36)
instagram and see all the builds and (127:34 - 127:38)
catch up on this got buffed and this got (127:36 - 127:41)
nerfed and blah blah blah (127:38 - 127:43)
no i i think like if if you just want to (127:41 - 127:44)
play (127:43 - 127:47)
you know nine tails as long as as long (127:44 - 127:47)
as (127:47 - 127:49)
you know that you know nine tails (127:47 - 127:50)
usually goes bottom can go top (127:49 - 127:53)
homework homework because that's not but (127:50 - 127:54)
the game tells (127:53 - 127:56)
the game tells you you should go to the (127:54 - 127:58)
bottom it does tell you (127:56 - 128:00)
absolutely says suggested and (127:58 - 128:02)
recommended okay in your battle prep (128:00 - 128:05)
it does tell you these things like i i (128:02 - 128:07)
made a i made a speedster graphic i was (128:05 - 128:09)
like here are the four speedsters here (128:07 - 128:10)
is the difference between the speedsters (128:09 - 128:11)
and then here (128:10 - 128:14)
if speedsters are recommended for jungle (128:11 - 128:15)
the center (128:14 - 128:17)
and i was like here's the order for (128:15 - 128:19)
jungle if you care to do that you gotta (128:17 - 128:21)
go lilly pup ludacola (128:19 - 128:24)
buffalant corfish but if you have (128:21 - 128:26)
zero desire to play any of the (128:24 - 128:28)
speedsters or (128:26 - 128:31)
cinderace or lu lucario or (128:28 - 128:33)
you just don't like jungle you can (128:31 - 128:34)
ignore that whole graphic or you want to (128:33 - 128:35)
be jungle crystal (128:34 - 128:39)
jungle crystals stop putting those (128:35 - 128:40)
thoughts into people's heads (128:39 - 128:43)
don't ever jungle crustal jungle cram (128:40 - 128:44)
look if you want to run zero or on the (128:43 - 128:46)
top lane you can (128:44 - 128:48)
i am sure i am sure there is some (128:46 - 128:50)
japanese player out there (128:48 - 128:53)
who takes elder goss into the jungle and (128:50 - 128:54)
dominates (128:53 - 128:57)
oh i haven't done jungle goth i don't (128:54 - 128:58)
know what that looks like (128:57 - 129:01)
you probably shouldn't do that but i am (128:58 - 129:03)
sure there is like you can make any role (129:01 - 129:03)
work (129:03 - 129:06)
anywhere if you are good enough that (129:03 - 129:07)
being said (129:06 - 129:08)
most of y'all ain't good enough to do (129:07 - 129:12)
that myself included (129:08 - 129:12)
and it's like and i think there's just (129:12 - 129:15)
like this misunderstanding of and this (129:13 - 129:17)
is why i put the abilities on (129:15 - 129:20)
the um the jungle guide is (129:17 - 129:22)
is like i had some people being like (129:20 - 129:23)
well you forgot cinderease (129:22 - 129:26)
no i didn't forget cinderace this is a (129:23 - 129:26)
speedster (129:26 - 129:29)
guide these are the four speedsters yes (129:26 - 129:31)
you can take cinderace in the jungle (129:29 - 129:33)
why is cinderella's good in the jungle (129:31 - 129:34)
well that would be a whole separate (129:33 - 129:34)
graphic (129:34 - 129:38)
i can tell you why but i'm i i only got (129:34 - 129:39)
so much room on a graphic (129:38 - 129:41)
people have short attention spans i'm (129:39 - 129:44)
focusing on two things speedsters (129:41 - 129:47)
the order you attack them in but (129:44 - 129:50)
why speedsters are called speedsters is (129:47 - 129:51)
look at their abilities (129:50 - 129:54)
like talonflame gets a huge boost when (129:51 - 129:56)
it has full hp because of gale wings (129:54 - 129:58)
gengar when not in battle moves super (129:56 - 130:00)
quickly the whole point of the jungle (129:58 - 130:02)
is to flex between top and bottom can (130:00 - 130:04)
cinderace do this yes but it's not (130:02 - 130:07)
nearly as fast as the pokemon weave well (130:04 - 130:09)
as their aura is not (130:07 - 130:10)
fast it gets like an attack boost or (130:09 - 130:13)
whatever um (130:10 - 130:16)
and that's fine to use cinderease or (130:13 - 130:18)
lucario or garchomp in the jungle (130:16 - 130:22)
but for people who are new knowing (130:18 - 130:25)
why the speedsters are speedsters i feel (130:22 - 130:27)
is an important thing to communicate (130:25 - 130:29)
like homework and (130:27 - 130:30)
and if you're looking at that graphic (130:29 - 130:31)
and you're like i know all this why (130:30 - 130:33)
didn't you include cinerace it's like (130:31 - 130:35)
graphic wasn't meant for you buddy right (130:33 - 130:37)
but yeah i mean (130:35 - 130:39)
yeah all right we've used up our 10 (130:37 - 130:40)
minutes of unite (130:39 - 130:44)
question of the week do you want the (130:40 - 130:46)
question of the week (130:44 - 130:50)
because it's that time again (130:46 - 130:50)
there wasn't a third verse there i mean (130:50 - 130:53)

netflix (131:07 - 131:12)
series full dialogue like ryan reynolds (131:08 - 131:14)
hmm (131:12 - 131:14)

i don't know who omar sai is um (131:41 - 131:45)
but what's that uh (131:46 - 131:52)
one girl (131:49 - 131:57)
from not the office (131:52 - 132:00)
parks and rec i think she was like (131:57 - 132:02)
audrey plaza (132:00 - 132:05)
no she was the darker skinned girl but (132:02 - 132:06)
she always i think she was a show writer (132:05 - 132:07)
but also an (132:06 - 132:10)
actor though oh i know here we played (132:07 - 132:14)
i think her name was mina in the show no (132:10 - 132:16)
yeah she had she had her own show yeah (132:14 - 132:18)
she had her own show after parks and rec (132:16 - 132:18)
she's (132:18 - 132:20)
like really funny i don't know i think (132:18 - 132:21)
she's like south asian (132:20 - 132:26)
um yeah oh dagnabbit (132:21 - 132:28)
who did she play was she the nurse was (132:26 - 132:30)

the actors that played donna (132:35 - 132:42)
no no no no no no no no maybe (132:38 - 132:44)
no (132:42 - 132:44)
we're confusing like eight different (132:45 - 132:49)
women all (132:47 - 132:50)
i'm just trying to figure out what (132:49 - 132:51)
character you're talking about because (132:50 - 132:54)
i've watched a lot of perkins wreck (132:51 - 132:56)
i think i think steve thinks she was on (132:54 - 132:58)
parks and rec but she wasn't (132:56 - 133:02)
oh oh that would help (132:58 - 133:06)
she was on the office oh was it the (133:02 - 133:06)
office (133:06 - 133:10)
yes i see i almost said the office and (133:06 - 133:11)

kind of close i got three letters right (133:26 - 133:29)
good for you (133:28 - 133:32)
i guess yeah she seems cool i don't know (133:29 - 133:34)
she is yeah maybe there's some drama but (133:32 - 133:36)
she seems all right i could see her (133:34 - 133:37)
being like a (133:36 - 133:40)
wiggly tough or something (133:37 - 133:40)
she's very sassy i remember her being (133:40 - 133:45)
very sassy on the office (133:42 - 133:49)
edward james almost oh there he is (133:45 - 133:52)
jigglypuff (133:49 - 133:52)

clefable (133:56 - 134:00)
i said clefable what do you say is never (133:57 - 134:01)
complainable i (134:00 - 134:02)
the first thing i did was the fable you (134:01 - 134:04)
are the worst you don't know all right (134:02 - 134:06)
a second question of the week this is (134:04 - 134:07)
off our youtube if you are watching on (134:06 - 134:08)
youtube you want to ask a question (134:07 - 134:09)
there'll be a question of the week (134:08 - 134:10)
thread pinned (134:09 - 134:13)
you can ask a question there we we're (134:10 - 134:14)
we're getting to it (134:13 - 134:18)
um this one is from uh (134:14 - 134:22)
cl clue crutch i don't know how to say (134:18 - 134:22)
that (134:22 - 134:24)
uh it'll say it'll say at the top if (134:22 - 134:25)
you're watching the video feel free to (134:24 - 134:27)
ask your question the week though in the (134:25 - 134:28)
youtube comments (134:27 - 134:30)
is pokemon unite going to stay alive (134:28 - 134:31)
longer than (134:30 - 134:34)
three weeks (134:31 - 134:34)
yes 100 percent (134:34 - 134:38)
people love mobas people love pokemon it (134:38 - 134:42)
is the perfect mix (134:40 - 134:44)
i'll let me let me change let me change (134:42 - 134:46)
their question do you think we're all (134:44 - 134:47)
going to be playing this when uh like (134:46 - 134:50)
diamond pro comes out (134:47 - 134:52)
three months uh so that really depends (134:50 - 134:54)
on how quickly they add things to the (134:52 - 134:56)
game like new characters new maps (134:54 - 135:00)
like if because let's if it is the exact (134:56 - 135:02)
same game (135:00 - 135:05)
uh by the middle of november probably (135:02 - 135:06)
not (135:05 - 135:08)
uh i will probably put in and like i'll (135:06 - 135:09)
do like oh i'm going to do my daily (135:08 - 135:11)
because i still really enjoy the game (135:09 - 135:13)
but like the amount of time that i'm (135:11 - 135:14)
putting into it now (135:13 - 135:17)
if things haven't changed or there's not (135:14 - 135:19)
new characters to try or new maps to (135:17 - 135:20)
play on (135:19 - 135:23)
uh i probably won't be as invested in it (135:20 - 135:23)
uh (135:23 - 135:27)
in four months as i am now so (135:23 - 135:29)
the cycle that i've seen for a lot of (135:27 - 135:31)
people who i would say are (135:29 - 135:34)
like dedicated moba players moba is (135:31 - 135:36)
one of their prime types of game that (135:34 - 135:37)
they enjoy playing (135:36 - 135:39)
it's kind of like a three weeks on three (135:37 - 135:41)
weeks off (135:39 - 135:44)
cycle where there will be updates new (135:41 - 135:46)
like new pokemon will be released (135:44 - 135:47)
something like that they get they get (135:46 - 135:48)
into it they play hardcore for three (135:47 - 135:50)
weeks and then they've like kind of (135:48 - 135:51)
played out (135:50 - 135:54)
that scenario they take three weeks off (135:51 - 135:55)
they wait until the next set of updates (135:54 - 135:56)
they pop back in and (135:55 - 135:58)
it becomes very cyclical in how they (135:56 - 136:00)
play (135:58 - 136:04)
um i think the thing you see on like uh (136:00 - 136:08)
twitch is you see you saw all the (136:04 - 136:10)
dota players all the league of legends (136:08 - 136:11)
players like of course they're gonna try (136:10 - 136:13)
any new moba they're addicted (136:11 - 136:17)
so you see all these like really good (136:13 - 136:19)
other moba players play unite we saw (136:17 - 136:21)
this with pokken tournament too (136:19 - 136:22)
you know all the mortal kombat people (136:21 - 136:24)
the dare alive people the tekken people (136:22 - 136:25)
they came over because they want they (136:24 - 136:28)
always try the newest fighting game (136:25 - 136:29)
and they go yeah this is fine but you (136:28 - 136:31)
know the reason they're addicted to (136:29 - 136:33)
league is because they (136:31 - 136:34)
it's league like league is a more (136:33 - 136:36)
complicated game dota is a more (136:34 - 136:38)
complicated game so (136:36 - 136:42)
i don't like they had fun with poke (136:38 - 136:44)
with unite and then they moved back and (136:42 - 136:46)
their audiences followed them there and (136:44 - 136:49)
they played it for a day or two but (136:46 - 136:51)
we're going to i would assume in the (136:49 - 136:52)
next (136:51 - 136:55)
three weeks three months whatever is the (136:52 - 136:56)
people who are really good (136:55 - 136:59)
at unite will stay really good and they (136:56 - 137:01)
will grow their audiences (136:59 - 137:03)
and the game won't be as big as it was (137:01 - 137:05)
you know the weekend it launched but (137:03 - 137:07)
that's just because so many people tried (137:05 - 137:09)
it and decided that (137:07 - 137:10)
you know they like league better or they (137:09 - 137:12)
like dota better or they like overwatch (137:10 - 137:13)
better or whatever (137:12 - 137:15)
and the people who like pokemon the (137:13 - 137:17)
people who like this simpler version of (137:15 - 137:18)
a moba (137:17 - 137:22)
they'll stick with it um the goal (137:18 - 137:25)
is can you get people on the fence to (137:22 - 137:27)
continue playing it (137:25 - 137:29)
by helping them understand the game (137:27 - 137:30)
easier so they (137:29 - 137:33)
do enjoy it um so then they can get (137:30 - 137:34)
their friends and like family into it as (137:33 - 137:36)
well and i think that's the biggest (137:34 - 137:38)
hurdle is not (137:36 - 137:41)
is not like people leaving but like (137:38 - 137:43)
getting more people into play and (137:41 - 137:43)
hopefully (137:43 - 137:46)
i think characters do that right you (137:43 - 137:47)
know if somebody's favorite pokemon is (137:46 - 137:51)
is hitmonch fan and they add hitmonchan (137:47 - 137:53)
i feel like that's the (137:51 - 137:54)
opportunity there where they go well now (137:53 - 137:56)
i gotta try the game so they do have the (137:54 - 137:58)
advantage of (137:56 - 138:01)
adding pokemon that people care about to (137:58 - 138:02)
play (138:01 - 138:05)
said game so yeah what greg said they (138:02 - 138:06)
keep adding characters (138:05 - 138:09)
i don't think it's gonna die anytime (138:06 - 138:12)
soon (138:09 - 138:12)
pokemon of the week so last week's (138:13 - 138:18)
pokemon was a lot of (138:16 - 138:21)
blah blah blah unite stuff i mentioned (138:18 - 138:24)

pokemon (138:39 - 138:42)
is focus band muscle band and buddy bear (138:40 - 138:44)
i'm a big fan of buddy barrier (138:42 - 138:47)
i like buddy which is not an item that's (138:44 - 138:48)
found in other games (138:47 - 138:50)
some people say this pokemon is based on (138:48 - 138:51)
a cat but it's mostly (138:50 - 138:53)
more likely based on the hibernating (138:51 - 138:54)
bear (138:53 - 138:57)
and then i described what uh buddy (138:54 - 138:58)
barrier does and also (138:57 - 139:01)
the fact that you can no longer uh get (138:58 - 139:02)

catchphrase (141:46 - 141:49)

pre-evolutions category (143:10 - 143:13)
