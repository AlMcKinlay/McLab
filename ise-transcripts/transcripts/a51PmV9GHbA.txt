[Music] so [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 474th third third episode fourth episode 473 it is on my list and you never ask you know i keep a list you know that i have her written down and you don't even ask you the person that makes the show should have a list i do have a list oh it's at the top of his outline that he never shows us correct oh my gosh hi uh my name is steve welcome to this pokemon podcast we talk about pokemon here this is our new intro i sound very amount of welcome to the pokemon uh greg is here hi uh let me know when i can do my psa because it's very important okay we'll also hear no psa i i have nothing important to say okay you might as well just send me home wait you are home to bed send me to bed go to bed go to bedwell go to bed well go to bed steve both of you look tired yeah i had a long weekend of fun in pokemon i was i was out there in the mud this morning you can't even you can't see it but there's mud all over my super effective shirt that i'm wearing right now i was in the mud this morning mountain biking oh my god not like gardening no oh heck no no gardening what is this psa before we start all right this is a psa to all the youtube creators who are excited that pokemon unite is presenting you with new exciting content okay point one little pup is not a fox it is a dog as stated by the name lollipop it's buffalont not bufflant three it's looty colo not ludicolo i wish i was making that up and four it's cinderache not cinderease who have you been watching who are you i'm watching this putting out this garbage content the about so i went and i was like okay i want to like see what other people are doing and see how they're playing the game and one person the entire time kept saying ludicolo and i was so distracted by this pronunciation that i could not continue with the video and i had to go back and make i was like okay you can't that had to have been a joke but it kept happening and there was no like ha ha it was just so then you'll attack ludicolo you don't need to watch any of these youtube videos i'm putting out very helpful guides that save people 10 minutes of their time look i am not psaying to you i am psaying to the people who are trying to make content for pokemon folks pronunciations are indeed difficult but you can find them it is never ludicolo the lilly pup is a fox really throws me off i did you because it's like a kiss the guy's like okay so you want to kill this fox thing first and i'm like what fox thing and then they're chasing lily pup and i'm like but it says pup in the name i mean they asked look it's been a wild weekend of content i'm veteran three i had an incredible night on unite last night i'm flying high but i'm doing everybody else a favor learn learn how to say pokemon names please it's you go a palm or ipom a pum apam who's saying ipom well who's saying ludicolo but here we are i hate this timeline i mean okay um in there you could say no because there's there's a p and then the o is right there so it technically could make the i long so a i up all right before we start talking about unite or pokemon go uh let's talk about pokemon snap that'll be our first bit of news here nintendo live sent in by alex from our slack community this week's new pokemon snap update also includes quality of life improvements um here here are the improvements now when you go to retry a level after completion you will get to select the research level again so you don't have to exit in order to select the same stage at a different research level you now have the ability to go directly to camp without having any photos assessed if you achieve a len talk mission on one of your photos it will get flagged as meeting the requirements before you get it assessed you can now directly save your images to the nintendo switch you can now save images on your nintendo switch directly from the photo editing option oh the len talk mission is the thing that i think yeah that's like the big one that's like the big one that's a big one that's a goodie too bad i've not played that game did you not play the update no i watched you i told you i was gonna watch you play it so i could see if the one pokemon that i want is in the game it wasn't and therefore it was a trash update and i refused to do it besides unite came out and i'm uh a pro circuit player so i have to put in my unite hours all the pros are master like two weeks ago nah they're out there doing whatever they're doing those are the fake pros that are gonna leave the game in a week not the hardcore long time pros the ones that worked for it i didn't pay to win steve i didn't pay to win i'm doing it the old-fashioned way i'm earning it i put about three to four hours into the snap update um i ended up finding like 12 or 13 of the 20 pokemon they added uh there's three levels there each level has a day and night i did all of them all six i guess um they are new levels except the first one which is like you have to go into the park find the tree scan the tree it then opens the level it reminds me of the electrode situation in the first pokemon snap where you have to like hit the electrode to open the path and then when you're go so that so in order to open that level you have to like go into a level and do it the other two levels are just click on these levels and start and then when you're done with that level the first level that you go into the park find the tree do the level then it poops you back out into park and you're in the floor just field yeah yeah no that is accurate and then i would say that that's what happened and then when you open when you open that list so when you do that level the first time then you can select it separately unlike the other two levels where you can just do it but when you do the level separately and this is the level that shrinks you down this is the only zone that shrinks you down there's a snorlax and you ride in a mulga and stuff when it ends it then poops you back out into the park again and you're in the buffal ant field can we can we use a different term when you exit when you exit when you exit forcibly from the digestive system that was a little weird um i'm not sure why that is it's it's like whatever it's just weird that one of the three you have to go into a level to unlock but it also uses the old level where the other two because i can't think of another there's not out of what the 14 15 maps nothing really does that we live in a world of chaos it's just an artifact of the way that this universe was built it was a design choice and they made the choice and we live with the choice yeah i i did like the finding the tree it took me like two passes in the park to figure out which tree it was i mean does it not question mark it does but if you're if you're like you know if you're in your lens and you're snapping pictures of ducklit you miss it sometimes you gotta get some good pictures of duckling i don't know there's i mean i've i thought four four star or four gold platinum pictures i mean i do but ducklit is douglas i mean i i did see the part where they doubled down on beethoven they did yeah hardcore double down um so all three of these levels are how do i describe this to me they're they're incredibly short they're not very long and they seem to be set up to be harder like i would wear difficulty level yeah i went through the the mountain one that that has like crustal and rock rough and tepig and there's um one of like the first puzzles is you can have a diglett knock a rock off into a geyser hole there's two geysers and i still i did it like six times i don't know what it does nothing happens when the diglett like besides the rock falling in the geyser like there i did no and did no rock i did no diglett and of course to anyone listening yes i could go to serbia and i could look up exactly what it does but i think the joy for me and snap is i've i've never looked up sereby for anything i have no clue like the 80 plus hours i played i think there's only three pokemon or four pokemon where i'm like okay twitch chat just tell me how to do it because i i can't figure it out so that has been like a real joy for me and i'm thinking like for a person who wants that sense of discovery like the first pokemon snap i don't i don't know what to do then in the desert the second thing is there's like a sand waterfall and it says oh there's a sweet scent coming from this i've thrown apples i played music i don't know what to do there either and then there's a swamp area where scolapede is and there's a lot of stuff happening there i haven't triggered anything in that zone and then there's like one more final area where there's a bunch of holes in the wall and like onyx will peek out and i'm not sure what to do there either and that's kind of like the whole map there's like four specific areas so it's a short map but it just feels like the things you need to do to get pokemon to appear just seem more difficult and we've talked about this before i have like how greg needed to get all the menuers i haven't even done that part yet i know i know that you have to get all the menus together and you have to like find them as you go and that's like a tougher challenge and there's a kangaskhan in that same level with the mini ear where it's like okay i know kangaskhan does something but i don't know what to do to get it to do something so i love that i love that the game has so much little details and the trial and error eventually pay off but i feel like the dlc is good because it's free yeah but then it it it gave me like this rush of frustration almost instantly because when i went when i went through the park and i took all these pictures all of them were gar they were all bad like it's like because i've put so much time into it to spend three four or five minutes on a course and then just know that maybe only one picture will be good it's just like oh okay like what's the point keep trying i'm not getting a better molga at this point i'm not getting a better pikachu at this point it's just like we'll see that save your film for the tree well when you go to the tree you have so many old pokemon there so you're snapping pictures of those like when you when you're in the tree like there's b doof and there's dodrio and there's a moga like these are new pokemon like there's um so it's more for the enthusiast than for the collector i think it is designed for more like hardcore snap players that want to try to figure out those little puzzles but i would imagine if you just go to serbian you look it up because like most of the pokemon of the 20 you don't have to do anything special for you don't have to do anything special for crustal or tepe or rakra for snorlax they're literally right there so i'd imagine if you go to serbia and we're like okay how do i activate gyarados which i heard gyarados is very hard to pop out like you're kind of just like looking at the back of the book for the answers to the crossword puzzle and then like flipping back and filling them in right like it is a puzzle game and the joy is discovering the puzzle and i think the courses are cool they're just really short i mean yeah there's a dlc dude no i'm not saying it's bad i'm just explaining my thought process going through uh and i'm i can definitely see why people fall off pokemon snap because yeah it is it can be discouraging if you're going through the same level over and over to get something to happen and one you're not getting anything to happen or two you know you're taking photos of other stuff but it's just not doing better than your other photos there's not that like good feeling of like nice job nice job nice job it's just like you were klaus you were close you were close and it's like well you were close isn't scratching the itch and wanting to keep playing this game again because i'm not succeeding i have another game that's telling me i'm not succeeding as well i have a whole bunch of games telling me i'm a failure well steve d have you ever done jigsaw puzzles like the putting pieces together on a table yeah the definition of jigsaw puzzles yes not not being trapped in some psycho's death maze the actual puzzle no irena and i have a pokemon one that we plan on doing together as a date plan on doing see this is the thing right in life there are jigsaw puzzle people there are board game people right uh-huh you are clearly not see a jigsaw puzzle person they they put together the jigsaw puzzle they have the satisfaction of having solved all the pieces together they see the picture and they say i did a good job i'm done they take it apart put it away maybe five years later they should lack it hang it up back out again the the shellackers and hang it uppers are very rare because that's just a lot of work board game people are like i played this game next week i want to play this game again because it's going to be different next week i want to play this game again because it's going to be different right they're not jigsaw pokemon snap is the jigsaw puzzle of video games you go through it you solve it you're happy with what you've done and you put it away look it was a free update it got at least three hours out of me but don't don't expect it to be a board game i want i want to get all i want to get all 20 pokemon i want to figure out how to get start looking for those edge pieces match up the colors all the different color pieces that match up to each other uh i want to get gyarados uh greg i got a psa what i already did psa no you you you made me mad with your youtubers uh pronouncing lulu dicolo i'm not saying that who gives these youtubers a right to tweet here's how you get x legendary mythical pokemon in the new pokemon snap dlc like 30 minutes after it comes out like i kind of figured there was gonna i'm gonna say legendary slash mythical because i don't want to give away what it is but out of the 20 pokemon there's a legendary slash mythical we kind of i would have guessed i would have i mean so i is your complaint why are you spoiling that right away why does twitter five minutes after something comes up spoil it why does it do it for literally every media that exists absolutely why was there cars driving past people waiting in harry potter line or in star wars lines screaming spoilers at them because they saw a preview of it because people are mean it wasn't the i i must the youtuber wasn't i don't think saying youtubers i saw like two of them they were like here's how you get x which is like oh we i want you to click on my video to see how to get it but all right they wanted to be the first uh yeah i'm the first person that told you how to do this all you have to do is say like i feel like if you want more clicks you say here's how you get the new legendary slash mythical pokemon because people will go too many oh it's too much thought and i don't know what you're talking about no because people would have been like which one is it no wouldn't you just say which one it is because the legendary slash mythical is in your like top 25 percent of pokemon enthusiasts the bottom 75 percent no pokemon name i'm sorry like the middle 50 no pokemon names the lower 25 no pikachu and the fire lizard guy first off there look it's not volcanion i get it if it was like look this is how you get volcanion people would have been like which which one is that a pokemon it's the one that ash got stuck to in steampunk land i sincerely believe that if you said this is how you get the new legendary or mythical you could replace the words you could put a slash in the new pokemon snap dlc you would get more clicks because i would be like i wonder which one that is but but now that they said it one i'm annoyed but two i'm not going to click on your video because i don't wanna know how to get it i wanna figure it out myself but that's you you are a tiny percentage of the public you i don't think that the the vagueness of the pokemon would make you wanna click verse just laying the pokemon out amount of people that are absolutely spoiler averse are smaller than the people who don't care about spoilers i don't care about spoilers in fact knowing spoilers helps me enjoy things because i don't care about spoilers either in the sense of i was going to go to cereby and look it up i was more thinking this is the problem the more just like blatantly saying what it is on these like so that's that's that's that's not that's not caring about spoilers i would prefer to know because i would have gone to sarah and looked it up anyways the problem is number one the word is pronounced vague not vague uh and there's it's like piccolo but with a lewd in front of it this was a an issue with monster hunter rise as well because they literally and they're like it's fundamentally of like what is the purpose of having this creature in the game in monster hunter rise there's a creature that's supposed to show up and surprise you and be like oh geez that thing just what the heck was that that just came in and like within 30 minutes of it being intrusive game everybody had youtube videos and tweets and like oh they put this one in the game when they specifically had not put that in any of their and it's like it's the same thing right the legendary mythical is supposed to be oh wow this guy's in here what a surprise and like the the tweeters and everybody are ruining that surprise for everyone they put surprisosaurus rex in mount monster hunter yes they put surprise asaurus rex in monsters we've gone this whole show not saying which one it is yeah because i also don't know which one i've actually forgotten which one it is and i think for me the enjoyment of snap was being like oh look at i didn't know b doof was in this game or wow i didn't know blastoise was in this game or or whatnot right there are some exceptions you know if they if if if some if these pokemon were shown in a trailer like tropius or ursa ring or whatever was shown in the new pokemon snap trailer i feel like that's free game to talk about if somebody chooses not to watch the trailer and then complains when they're listening to a pokemon news podcast you know that's kind of on them at that point like we're talking about official media i do remember which one it is i just think from a i need i'm thinking from a youtuber i'm not a youtuber but i'm thinking from a i think you are a youtuber how how how can i get people to click on my video i i just think they get more mileage out of that click by being vague in that situation instead of just laying out and saying it i am trying to give them advice to increase their click bait and they just kind of they they uh they overshot see they were too direct what you're also missing is the people who are going to go to this video are the people who want the problem solved for them they don't they're not i want to put effort or thought into this kind of people so if you say legendary or mythical they're once again you're requiring effort and thought on their part for them to figure out what does that actually mean if i want to actually click on this video and and that's not the that's not the audience they're trying to appeal to i don't have time to waste on figuring out which mythical greg leatherman i went on to my switch on friday at like one in the afternoon and somebody was playing pokemon unite when they were supposed to be at work uh i had conference calls from 9am until 1pm and that was my only lunch break and might i add only break of the day i did not get to have a break until one and i had been on the calls i had been at work since 7 30 a.m right there kinda sus leatherman i'm pretty sure greg has like 200 more matches in unite than i do instead of actually playing unite i'm i'm sitting over um let me tell you can i let's back up a second my air conditioning went out again the the thing outside was fine it was something inside it was the it wasn't you know the furnace in the basement yeah it wasn't blowing anything oh okay so your fan went out but everything outside was working they eventually came it took them like 15 minutes they replaced one part boom cold air shh great while while everyone in the world is playing unite i'm over here with a macbook pro on my lap with no air conditioning let me tell you the macbook pro gets very hot i'm trying to edit these like infographics you made your choices i'm very happy that people i'm very very happy access to a public library yeah at 3 am in the morning oh yeah oh that's right captain night i will never sleep yeah like you look like you bury your own poor choices all the time if you worked normal business hours like the rest of us you would go to a cafe that has ac you can sit there having your chai latte making your little graphics and then show up at 6 00 p.m for your little stream or whatever you do and then get off stream relax for like half an hour and go to bed and get up and go and enjoy a lovely day in a caffeinated look holy [ __ ] several wonderful coffee shops in downtown milwaukee ward over by there's a lot of good ones we got some we got we got we got a lot of good ones here when i'm in minnesota if you want me to get up at 9 a.m to go to a coffee shop i'll do it you just let me know i'll put on the camera okay at 9 00 a.m 9 a.m i've been at work for an hour and a half i've been at work for a chunk of time at that point but i could use a break sure i'm very happy that people like the graphics i've been making they have been very good graphics but don't don't yell at us for your poor choices go to bed sleep like a normal person no i'm just saying that you've played a lot of united i haven't had a chance you have as much chance as i have i also work an eight-hour job where i just talked about how you were playing unite during your gym during my lunch i get a lunch break it's federally mandated and stay mandated but you're on like eight zoom calls in a row with no video and you're on only mute i know you're playing united i have not played i did not play unite on those calls on friday i have played unite on large town hall calls where i know nobody will speak to me and i will not have to have had paid any sort of attention but i have an eight-hour job thank you very much i work from 7 30 till the time i stop and i get a lunch break in there this is on pokemon.com pokemon 25 the red ep three new artists have joined the pokemon 25th anniversary including vince staples sin and zoo staples and sin contribute to an exclusive new song uh on the red ep there what what there's a lot happening in this press release and i'm not happy about it number one is vince staples the s is not capitalized in staples i don't know if that's supposed to be the proper but they capitalize in the next sentence number two is they capitalize the red ep but halfway through the sentence they just don't capitalize the red ep i don't uh but then they capitalize it again in the next sentence uh the ready p along with mabel's song take it home oh they capitalized vince staples at this one oh boy this seems this music thing seems like a disaster i'm just gonna be sad i'm sorry it's bad let me confirm is a disaster uh vince staples says i've always been a pokemon fan so i was particularly special to be asked to take part in the 25th anniversary uh gotham vince staples faces the challenge head-on drawing inspiration from the iconic characters mew and raichu i mix well these jen wonders they picked i'm excited for people to get to hear gotham and i hope the song resonates with fans especially the ones that grew up with pokemon like i did sin offers the song wonderful i'm so excited to release one of my favorite songs i've ever written wonderful in the celebration 25 years of pokemon the song is special to me because i felt it comments on the growing pains also emphasizing a destination of grace and beauty uh eggs hatching when they want or in other words when they're ready that was a weird transition in that sentence when i wrote the song my newborn baby was in the room i can hear the influence of becoming a new mother in music it will always run special for me and then mabel literally just says take it home an original song from a brit award recipient mabel they i don't think they got a quote from her like they did the other two if they did the quote would be there i would assume well i mean the mabel song was released before the ep came out and the two others only appeared on this ep so i think i think mabel did a quote earlier about why i'm rolling around on a bed with jigglypuff when they when their song was yeah released on its own i watched the music video to that it was fine it was just like it didn't really stick out to me does this in in fur that there will be a blue ep there is a black there is a blue one it's gonna have uh katy perry and wait really the two people they announced zoo is going to be on the blue jays zoo is doing the remixes for the re red remix and the blue remix or is zoo doing a song on blue and somebody else is doing the remixes no if you scroll down uh it says reflecting the long-standing tradition of dual release the core of the core pokemon series uh which each featuring nuances difference from the original plan paying homage to the original pokemon red and blue the blue ep will follow later this month it will feature remixes of the red songs by recording grammy nominated recording artix artist zoo so zoo's doing the remixes so then so is blue not going to have any of the other songs on it is there going to be a yellow that is katy perry and somebody katy perry and uh what uh post malone and jay bal baldwin those are going to be on the official album which is supposed to be 10 songs i believe so we know three of the ten i'm very confused also it really bothers me this is i went to graphic design the pokemon blue ep and pokemon red ep in the yellow bar on the album is not properly centered it's too high and the accent on the e is touching the top and there's too much space on the bottom it's really bothersome because like it's a very simple album cover which is fine i i like simple i get the aesthetic but you got because there's not a lot to focus on it is very noticeable that it's not centered also they're using like myriad pro which a decent font fine just shift it down like two pixels you can do it so you guys probably don't know the answer but is vince staples related to the staple singers i've never heard of vince staples or the staples singers be honest i've heard of the staples center i heard of the staples the store i don't think so i would assume not it's not that common of a last name though it's not that uncommon i don't know i mean my last name's not common there's still a lot of us around well it's not like anderson in minnesota okay trust me look you made choices poor choices i mean anderson ii only after johnson so you could be william johnson and then nobody would know who you are uh i listened to it i don't remember listening to it i remember thinking oh vince staples says write you in the song it's the first time i've heard pokemon directly referenced in any of these songs i automatically like this one better but that was the extent of it they are to me very forgettable i move yeah it's fine it it can i can i just imagine this is the 20. can i get it on vinyl can i order a cd of it can i put my i want like a physical thing i don't have a spotify i can tell you can buy it digitally but you can't get it in a physical form that i've seen because none of the ways they show that list to get it have a have a physical anything it's like yeah i see you can play it on apple music you can play it on spotify you can download in the itunes store which i don't i think literally the last time i bought music from itunes was gorillas i don't know i don't remember what album that was i mean i just was about the first album because that was about like 2 000 2000 no it was their last album i don't know which one it was i will i will if i like it i will always buy a physical copy because i don't want it to be removed and also i want to buy it in a way that's most direct so that the artist gets the most money so if they're on bank camp or some other way i will always buy a physical copy of it uh if not then i will go to itunes and buy a physical copy and i did not see a physical copy of this but since when i listened to it i was like and i don't want one it's also not available on amazon as uh no no it's it says on their website it's available on amazon music amazon music on amazon music not an album that you can order got it yes it's on amazon music it's on pandora it's on youtube it's on title it's on youtube music i look i i'd be interested in physical version just to you know collect it maybe i'll come out at the end of the year yeah maybe hopefully it'll be like a whole collection to to get a bottle box it yeah well the only reason i think they're gonna do it is because how is thinking to distribute in japan they got record they they love their physical music over there they got he says speaking for a whole country they do they got tower records everywhere they're like 17 floors it's great we have record stores here too people love it yeah it's not the same it's not like because i remember i used to go to the tower records in manhattan and that thing was like five stories tall each story i mean each floor had its own like genre and everything that we don't have that anymore i took i took nick to electric fetus and we bought physical music okay that's a specialty store does does the 25th anniversary and this music which again we're i feel like we're always down in the music when it comes out i look i'm not down on it if you like this style of music and a lot of people do like people really love the katy perry song it didn't do anything for me it is not the music that i enjoy listening to there are a ton of people who like i know there are people in slack who are big vince staples song this is the first thing i've ever heard from vince staples yeah so like i don't have an opinion other than this is the type of music which i tend not to like when they have the jukebox the ghost pokemon song greg and i will be we will be there when the wolf parade pokemon comes out the tokyo police club that does something pokemon i'm in when the decemberists make their evil hardline hardline no decemberists those two those people are way too pompous and full of this and if you try to get stuff john stevens up in here at the moment i'm out the room yeah well he's gonna do he's gonna do a whole uh region album series stuff john stevens is digimon okay that's that's what i'm telling you i mean you're not wrong does okay so you know we have mellowetta and go they're putting a lot of music stuff etc etc does this end with us finally getting the sword and shield album like we don't have that music yet yeah yeah maybe no maybe also there's no g in etc is it weird that they haven't like they usually release them pretty quick in japan after the games come out right is that not let's go had let's go came out in november right or october november i went to japan in march the however many months that is five months and they had aisles of let's go music cds in their pokemon centers so it was less than six months hmm it's because there's one more secret dlc coming out that since they haven't released the that dlc they can't release the music from it yet so can we confirm that it's not like the it's not the soundtrack isn't uh the soundtrack is not out in japan no there's no sword and shield music at all it's very weird it's been almost two years we don't have music for that game oh side note speaking of dlc thank you will for bringing that up um i don't think there will be any more pokemon dlc because when the game originally got data mined there was a bunch of missing spots for icons player icons and for pokemon missing and now they're all filled in so there's no more missing spots or no more missing icons um so i don't think there will be like a second round of dlc maybe i don't know obviously they can always add pages you can always add they can always add it but where is missing no but when the dlc originally came out there was like 20 spots missing and then there was a bunch of icons for your like player character missing and now those are all filled in technically so for me this music thing is just like i don't care about it until it's done basically yeah it's it's like when they're like hyping up a movie and it's like look at all these new trailers and it's like i i'm already gonna i'll just wait it's fine i mean i don't just give me the whole thing when it's done i'll give it a chance then my same complaint stands i really wish the pokemon songs were more related to pokemon and not here's feelings i had while thinking about pokemon but i'm not going to mention pokemon in any way shape or form i'm going to use very generic terms here's a song that we fit onto an album and we're going to change a couple words so we can give it to you like what was her uh yeah i was so excited to write the song about being a mother for pokemon like i mean it is called wonderful that is a pokemon character's catchphrase i mean it's kind of like hatching eggs in pokemon to then having a newborn baby is kind of a stretch kinda it is the definition of a stretch babies come from eggs yes we need to take a break thank you for making it far through the first half

oreo already had a pokemon on it but they didn't do anything special no come on that's the theme of the 25th anniversary steve get with the picture it's nothing special the 25th anniversary official sponsor is normal types aka nothing special how you just made steven super happy i do how do you do how how how's this messed up how do oreo and pokemon do nothing lady gaga got a whole cookie we don't know we don't know lady gaga has lots of money they have another one clearly something else yeah i guess they could do something else but i want like a yellow red green blue cookie i i what am i supposed to put into a plastic box next to my ancient mew in the closet oh don't put cookies in the box please i did that once you gotta air seal it yeah in those in those cereal box sealers look i bet greg collected the like pepsi star wars cans no was that not a thing i'm pretty sure it was with pepsi it was i didn't do it i did have briefly the was it pizza hut that had the weird toppers on top i don't remember i guess it was always the star wars yeah it was so i have i have a bunch of weird stuff packed away somewhere uh i mean i'm excited for nilla wafers because i really like nilla wafers but i will say that the i am working through my pokemon mini oreos uh and they are just or they're stories well this is what they don't tell you number one yes people do buy normal oreos don't be a fool yeah i did like two weeks ago and it was the biggest regret ever there there's not enough frosting in between but i can't fit my pork through the two cookies okay don't bring up that monstrosity again you are the worst person you are why why mess up a fork to do a dumb thing like dipping a cookie in milk because i don't want to wash my hands either just eat it's a figure food either way the mini packs this is the problem this is and it's it's like this is how we can tell that we're not in the 1970s anymore the mini packs are what we in the 70s would have called cereal you take the mini oreos you're probably going to need several of those packs four probably four take four of the mini packs of oreos put them in a bowl pour some whole milk on top take a spoon full of sugar dust it up on there and spin it stir it around stir it around get it all slushy and have and eat it real or real cereal and you can eat it with a spoon so i'm actually into this your hands aren't going to get dirty i'm actually into oh pouring but you can also do this with me two percent two percent no no no that there was no wisconsin 70s was whole milk we didn't trust that two percent stuff i don't even think it was invented yet what's the other 90 what's the other 98 what is it yeah it's cancer what was the other one we got oreos nilla wait nilla wafers are some of my favorite cookies just chips ahoy are bad it's basically just pretty bad cookie crisps which who knows if they make that we've probably got in trouble but it's it's just cookie crisp i saw on tick tock there is a cosmic brownie cereal somewhere out there and i need that in my life i don't like the cosmic brownies i love the cosmic brownies of course you do brownies anything that is pure garbage is your number cosmic brownies cosmic brownies are just a brownie with sprinkles on top they're they're like the they're like big like nerds though they're not like little sprinkles they're like chocolate like chocolate coated sprinkles they're like little m ms almost they're good so all right well now that we got past the oreo drama let's talk about the drama there's more oreo drama that will be had this year take my word for it oh i'm sure there will be hey you can get cosmic growing in cereal at walmart apparently then i have to go there all right we'll start with the good we'll start with the good stuff i guess ultra unlock part three the self pokemon go live.com trainers hoopa's mischief from pokemon go fest continues with the final part of our unlock event part three sword and shield no one could have predicted that you're right niantic you're the long con really we go in order for five years they'll never see this coming no one would have predicted that the pokemon originally discovered in the gala region of pokemon sword and shield will be making their pokemon go debut except for the ones that they already released the final part of this year's ultra unlock will feature the debut of the two legendary pokemon found in the gala region zashian and zamasunta also people say zashi and really weird like ludicolo zack sean zach i hear zatian a lot oh hey i could see like zatian does follow rules some rules of grammar zidane zanaxian is what it is right there no one ever says amazon's are wrong at least i've never heard anyone say that pretty big santa that's amazing i love zombies amazing amazing and snake uh it appears that the ones who brought them to the to pokemon go was none other than hoopa which is recently caused mischief at during go fest alongside them squivet greedent wulu double and phalanx will be arriving in pokemon go let me you know how many times i reread this press release looking for cramer ant it ain't here it's not here it's never coming if you're lucky you may even find a shiny gallerian meowth shiny glaring farfetch and a shiny glaring wheezing or a shiny gallerian stun fisk from march march that march came from from august 20th through august 31st local time squavet and wulu will appear in the wild you can also find galerian dharmaka trubish and more if you're lucky you may encounter a phalanx uh i guess rubbish makes sense because it gigantomaxes i'm that i'm gonna assume that that's why they are including rubbish there the following pokemon are hatching from 7k eggs gallery and meowth glare and ponyta galerion slowpoke gallery and farfetch'd galerion zigzag and glory and dharmaka glaring stun fisk this actually you know feels like good 7k eggs honestly since they're all galerian and since they all can be shiny it seems good if you're lucky you may encounter a shiny glaring meowth farfetch wheezing stun fisk that will be appearing in raids during the event complete event exclusive timed research for your chance to encounter pokemon first discovered in the region field research from pokestops include include you may encounter a squabbit oolo or phalanx starting thursday august 19th uniforms that appear in the gala region will be available as avatar items in the pokemon go this seems cool pick up the gym leader challenger uniform avatar for free which is worn by pokemon trainers challenging the gyms if you want to show off your dragon type or your dark type pride you can purchase the dragon type or dark type uniforms in the shop this okay on august 20th uh an event exclusive gift stickers will be available pick them up by spinning stops and gyms it's a two two week event so week one um you will have gallerian slowpoke farfetch unknown you gallerian zigzagoon just assume that i'm gonna put glare in in front of these pokemons names uh they will appear in one star raids uh gallerian wheezing lapras phalanx will appear in three star raids i guess lapras makes sense because it can also gigantomax um not that giant max is in the game but lore wise i feel like it works zashian in the hero of many battles form will appear in five star raids mega beedrill will be appearing in raids mega evolve beedrill for an advantage against zashian oh okay no one's gonna do that but thanks for bringing mega pedro back uh week two which starts on september 1st uh meowth ponyta daramaka first doesn't it what doesn't week week two rates start out august 26th and end september oh yeah sorry sorry yes thank you august 26 through september 1st uh meowth ponyta dharmak and one star raids snorlax stun fisk phalanx and three star raids zamazenta will be in five star raids mega pidgeot will appear in mega raids mega evolve pidgey out for advantage against zamasunta and yeah and they did like a little um like trailer for it with like hoopa like dropping wulu down it's really good it's a really cute like 30 second trailer um so before we get to the drama i want to say this and i feel like we've literally said this every year once a year for pokemon go because there's always something people are mad about and then they go well niantic's just releasing these to hide the facts i was gonna work niantic takes so long to communicate anything with us they take so long to fix things they take so long to do anything in this game so while i understand and i'm on people's side of being upset about the changes they made during a global pandemic they didn't panic release galler to try to hide it they've clearly been working on this for months this is the same company that can't even release keklian and it took him four years to release this miracle i can't remember ever since they panicked released meltan you can't trust that company it probably took them all six months to like get this trailer done this isn't a panic release it was on the calendar and we know we know that niantic doesn't know how a calendar works right because before go fest they said hey on this date in the future in two months we're removing covid restrictions and you know what they did they removed them because that's how their calendar works they set something and then they just do it they don't have they don't know how to backpedal they don't know how to last-minute change they don't know how to do the communications they can't pivot they can't pivot the narrative of this was like a panic release is just mind-blowing to me like people justify their outrage people wanna people wanna justify that that they're interested in interested in this thing while they're still mad at the thing by saying oh this is a panic release to distract me meaning i really want to do this but i'm also still mad at the stupid choices they made the choice they made is is stupid yeah it's dumb the covet stuff is dumb we're going to get to that in a second the the ultra unlock being sword and shield is really good like no one predicted it so having i wanted it to be arceus yes yeah or you know giratino or whatever you know pattern tina we need hoopa we need volcanion we need we need kecleon we need actually we need literally yeah for the gen 5 pokedex yeah yeah there's a lot missing but we're just gonna jump to seven which is whatever like why who cares if we're following it in order like at this point it it it doesn't matter patterns are not patterns it's like catch the sheep evolve the sheep then complain for the next five years that there's too many sheep like that i can't catch the sheep because go goats not in the game yet yeah there you go there's no go-go i still think like when sword and shield came out they should have just released wulu and squabbit and all the other things and that was the perfect opportunity to like line things up who cares if things are not in order and i was like everyone was like well they gotta go in order and it's like why well go because they've been doing it well okay after fi they're not doing it anymore well they haven't been doing it when they released wheezing like two years ago or whatever like who cares about this order just just release the pokemon i think that well i guess it doesn't matter i mean storage shield sold incredibly well it's like the third best-selling game it's like 21 million at this point i just think thematically it's been enjoyable when you open up masters they're doing an event that also pokemon go is doing that's also in sword and shield that's also you know in the tcg and we'll get there eventually you know pokemon go is going to catch up they're going to release gen 9 or gen 10 and as long as pokemon go isn't canceled by that point you know things will be in symmetry but whatever i i would like an extra zashian and an extra zamasu without playing through the game again that seems cool yeah i would like a wulu seems cool uh squavid's cute i very weird that they were like you know hey we have a bunch of low legendaries we could have done as well like that's fine maybe they have something else cooler for that i mean a calendar at a certain point we have to get gigantomax at a certain point we have to get dynamax yeah we're probably going to get z moves or something go battle league is still a hot mess i think outrage aside the ultra unlock part three seems cool it seems like great i mean and like i think how do you top finally putting shiny the alga and shiny pokey on raids which you know people wanted for a very very long time i don't think you know tapu coco would be as exciting maybe well for somebody who rarely if ever does raids if unless i'm like it's right in front of me and you guys are forcing me to this this is like a it's a non-event like yeah i'll catch the the gallerian nuclearians that they're gonna drop if my pokeball hack catches them otherwise yeah yeah i mean instead of wulu and squivet they could have done what are the uh young goose and what's the other one pikapec yeah yeah yeah i guess that would be it uh it it's it seems like it seems fine it seems like an exciting event whether or not you know people are not playing or playing i mean that's a that's up to them but i think the trailer they did for it i think the announcement i think was all good if you want real drama concerning uniforms greg yes stop putting that garbage on my instagram timeline i don't care who the artist is talk about the milo stuff yes stop it i don't want to see that milo is the best oh you're getting an unfollow fine uh you can't handle the hotness you can't handle what's good and what's cool then you garbage up your feed with your natty body pillows that went to thailand okay so before go fest we got to paint the picture here so because so pokemon go is a very big game there's a lot of players and there are a lot of hardcore players that pokemon go is their life and their identity and i don't mean that negatively that's you know some people you know world of warcraft is their life and their identity oh let's not bring them up right now and so before go fest they said we're gonna remove these coved restrictions in new zealand and the united the united states which on one hand you could be like well the united states has had a pretty decent rollout compared to other countries and new zealand's been pretty good for a while like new zealand's been pretty awesome everyone like seems to look to new zealand so you're like okay and this is not the first time niantic's removed features when the pandemic has gotten worse which goes to my beginning argument of this company doesn't know how to pivot probably because they need approval from pokemon or nintendo or google or who knows maybe john hanke lost masuda's phone number i'm not sure what happened there but when they announced their covid restriction and maybe i miss remembering greg and well you can let me know just trying to be fair before we get into this when they announced they were rolling back their coveted restrictions which was like two months ago which was after go fest everything was looking pretty good greg was planning on going to gen con pax was being taxes announced and and happening yeah i mean things were looking not things were were not good but they had shown signs of improvement but still at that time there were some worrying signs but people had already decided to go forward with the understanding of we would hit the july 4th benchmark that we were supposed to hit yeah it was before like the fourth of july and everything right yeah like we were still technically on track there were some worrying signs but like technically the the signs were hey we're probably going to get there yes and then the delta stuff got worse oh yeah um and like classic niantic when that date came around they flipped their switch and things got turned off and the new things got turned on there are new things like instead of getting one free raid pass a day you get two free ray passes and there's some other you can see in the app you don't i don't have to explain it all but the biggest thing was the distance of interacting with a pokestop and jim returned to normal and that's what made people upset because not only did it make it easier to reach pokestops but it added a lot of people who have trouble walking maybe they're on crutches or in a wheelchair or bedridden made it easier for them to play the game but also from a person who is outside and i want to give a very specific situation for me it's again it's it's it's a first world problem not the end of the world but this is the but like before i explain the situation i will say the first four years of pokemon go with the distance was always fine but when they increased it it was better and so i went downtown milwaukee during the afternoon which is paid parking i parked because i was picking up some food paid like a dollar fifty to park there was two raids one was a hair cross cool used my free raid pass did the hair cross walked over to a different raid did my unknown with my free raid pass picked up my food got my car and then i saw a palkia and i was like okay well i still have another free raid pass from yesterday i want to go do that palkia but i can't i can't walk there i mean i can but it's like 15 minutes there 15 minutes back so it's just easier if i drive over there so i drove over there and again i was like well oh cool a parking spot i parked but i was just out of the distance of it and i was like well if i get out of my car and walk over there i have to pay for parking or i could try to go down the street u-turn park again or i could go a little farther and then get free parking but then walk and at that point in all of this like driving two minutes to get there and then trying to find parking i just left the rate it wasn't worth it anymore like i want to play your game and i can't reach the gym even though like i should be able to like i'm so close to it like if i had like two more spots in front of me i would be able to pull forward and do it but i don't want to pay a dollar fifty to park i don't wanna drive farther and then walk five minutes i could just remote raid pass for a dollar at this point and it would have been significantly easier and it would have been cheaper than paying for parking so it's like i i didn't play your game because it was an inconvenience for me and just having the distance be a little bit bigger where i can reach a gym across the street wait why couldn't you use a remote raid pass oh i had a free raid pass for the day why wouldn't i want to try it you just you just said you would have used a remote raid i could have used a remote raid pass and it would have been cheaper than parking before greg says what he has to say number one don't be a wuss risk the ticket get out the car park it don't pay chinese worth the ticket i knew you guys are gonna say that you guys pay for the light rail here in minneapolis like fools you don't leave your car for five minutes thinking that some meter person is just waiting like a vulture to swoop down and write you a 25 ticket come on i think there are so many situations where people would play the game more maybe i don't know i think people have been people have been saying this maybe we haven't set in the show but i don't want to cross a dangerous intersection or like try to repark my car or to make a u-turn or to do this if i could just like slightly reach the stop a little bit better and safely or you could pay the dollar like they want you to do so they can make money there's there's a couple of things that one it wasn't like the distance was a mile right it wasn't like i could sit in my house and reach everything within my in a mile it was like 80 meters at the at the new distance which meant i was 800 meters because i think the original distance is 400 meters but it's but it's a like it's it's not 400 meters there it's it's 200 both ways because it makes us circle i don't know how circumference works but i believe it's 400 and then the new one was 800 and then they brought it back down to 400 i think that's how it works whatever it was it wasn't that it wasn't that i still didn't have to get to that range what it did do apart from making it easier for people to just get to it but a lot of their landmarks a lot of the things are inside things and when the distance was increased you could be outside where it was safer and you were in the open and reached things that were enclosed in small places so in downtown minneapolis there are starbucks that are only inside there are murals that are only inside and you could finally reach them from the outside i still had to walk there i still had to get to that area by walking or whatever but i did no longer had to be inside an enclosed area which we all know isn't safe so the frustrating thing about how they presented this change back was well we want you to walk well it it wasn't 50 miles it wasn't that i could get to a million stops by just sitting in my home i still had to walk there so their reasoning from the very beginning was not a good reason i still have to walk to it and you keep saying you're monitoring the situation you're not because the situation turned at the beginning of july and you didn't touch it or re-examine it in the three weeks that you had before you turned it off you did nothing so the biggest issue i have with the communication is not only are they bad at it is that they they don't even think about what they're saying they contradict themselves their words never match up to what they actually say they're doing if you were watching the situation we knew this was bad at the beginning of july we knew this was bad during go fast we knew this was bad and you keep saying well we're monitoring it and we're gonna choose you're not monitoring it in fact you didn't even say anything about it until a bunch of people said we don't want to play your game anymore and we're not going to give you free advertising and we're going to give you bad advertisement and then you put out a incredibly tepid press release you can't happen both ways you can't say we're monitoring it and then not actually monitor the situation or listen to anybody giving you feedback you can't do that and expect people to respect your company good transition i have the press release here the the press releases on their official website not on pokemon go live.com which i've been saying this for years we have i have no proof i'm sorry i don't and i'm sure niantic will never just come out and say this but i'm almost positive they cannot post anything live they cannot post anything on pokemongolive.com without pokemon's approval and normally it takes them normally they don't respond to things in the same day so since they responded this in the same day and they were they didn't post it on pokemongolive.com even though it's specifically for pokemon go people they post it on their own website makes me think that they didn't write it they didn't run it through the approvals that they normally have to run it for pokemon stuff or they ran it through like a lighter approval yeah they went through their legal department to say how how quickly will we get sued and is just breaching any contracts yes or no because they needed to put out something okay so the reason they put out a press release they they announced the the kova changes happened on whatever monday tuesday i don't remember well the reversion of the reversion of them and then they did the ultra release 3 which we talked about and then on thursday i've i have an issue with the pokemon go community but they i but i believe a bunch of really big pokemon go youtubers most of them got together they wrote a letter it was very well written i believe it was written by zoe two dots she's awesome she's a friend of mine and they used the hashtag it got to like number 12 trending in on twitter a bunch of other pokemon go people you know tweeted it pokemon go fans and niantic then released something i think it was like 8 30 central time pm at night after the response so i don't think i don't think it's like well they released in the night so no one would read it no i just think it took them all day legally to get something something approved and that was the fastest they could release it i don't think it was like oh let's release in the middle of the night so no one can read it like i don't think that was the case um i will say though my complaint here is if you're going to complain about a video game that you like maybe don't complain when nothing is happening in said video game like i don't know who decided thursday was the best day but i think it's a little ironic that it was like the day after diago ends and the day before palkia starts like oh i can't we can't announce it on this day we still gotta finish our dialga raids well we have to do it before palkia starts because i want to get shiny like it's just like i don't know maybe you should have like put your money where your mouth is and maybe do it the day that palkia starts and like boycott palkia i don't know it just it was it was a little funny and ironic to me that they did on a thursday when literally nothing in the game was happening um that's just a side note anyways uh okay i was right it said we've rooted the interactions from 80 meters to 40 meters i thought it was that's what it says in the press really maybe i'm thinking feet i don't know how meters and feet translate they are different three feet per meter yeah uh okay here's what it says meters this is 162 feet nianticlabs.com what about millimeters uh we uh we appreciate your letter and all your feedback we hear you we are humbled by your response not every game has a passionate global base that we are fortunate enough to have lie you need to beat some other fan bases like everyone around the world our team has been working very hard to adapt the global health environment recent exploration bonuses we've made in us and new zealand are designed to restore some of the foundational elements that players enjoyed prior to 2020 and reward players once again for moving and exploring encoura encouraging people to explore exercise and safely play together in person remains niantic's mission okay that's true they have like three pillars if you go to like their thing it's like exercise getting together and i think exploring i think that are those are the three pillars of like all their games are based off those three things surprising just in case people don't know niantic does make more than pokemon go they make they make other video games the health and well-being of our players is our top priority which is why we implemented the new excluration bonuses in select geographies geographies where it is deemed safe to be outdoors research has shown that taking walks outside is safe and confers several health benefits furthermore encouraging outdoor exploration is in keeping with niantic's mission that said we will continue to monitor the health and safety related to outdoor activities and will further make changes if necessary we have heard your feedback about one change in particular that of the pokestop and gym interaction distance we have reverted the distance from 80 meters to the original 40 meters starting in the us and new zealand because we want to see people connect with real places in the real world and visiting those places that are worth exploring however we have heard your input loud and clear and so to address your concerns you have raised we are taking the following actions we are assembling an internal cross-functional functional team to develop proposal designs to preserve our mission of inspiring people to explore the world together while also addressing specific concerns that have been raised regarding interaction distance we will share the findings of this task force by the next game season change on september 1st as part of this process we will be reaching out to community leaders in the coming days to join us in this dialogue our goal is to build fun and engaging experiences to remain true to our mission and we thank you for challenging us with thoughtful and constructive feedback the niantic team but what they're saying is we have multiple games in production and we are going to bring together specialists or department heads from each of those other games to talk about a universal overarching policy that we'll put in place so that everybody matches up it is different than getting feedback from say you it is we have to make sure internally that we make this chain change every game is on board and we're all doing it the same way and so it is a legal thing it is a we want to make sure that we are giving the same message so that so that niantic as a company is able to say here's the changing we'll make here's the change we're making across board so that harry potter and ingress and pokemon go and transformers go and transformers and all the things that they make match so they do need to bring everybody from each department internally together and say here's what we're doing will this affect your game in any way you when is when something is this impacting on your brand saying it's gonna take us three weeks to make a decision is a very it's a very bad look for a company especially since current companies are expected to pivot or die you turn on a dime or you're left behind and they are playing off the fact that they are uh a huge gorilla and there's not a lot of other things that sort of threaten them really um to say well we'll just take our time and we'll get it to you when it meets our schedule it is a kind of dismissive uh ploy to downplay urgency to give them plenty of time to come up with a well-crafted statement which you are clearly are not capable of doing uh so i i mean i can see where like yeah you all have been giving the feedback but they also have to make an internal decision what september first is like a thousand years from now and it it it speaks to we're hoping that these other events will distract you enough that you'll have lessened your angst about it so the decision that we finally make uh it won't be so emotional uh it won't have such emotional resonance because there's been a huge time frame for you to have to settle down a little bit it didn't work i have a different perspective uh than greg um so my take on cross-functional team is they're going to have somebody from their financial group somebody from their programming group somebody from their marketing group somebody from their customer relations group which would be the people that are talking to you steve they're gonna get them all in a room together and say what can we do now i can see targeting it towards the september first season change because that is a massive code update so they can get it into that cycle of when we're going to release an updated code and make that part of those changes rather than doing it as a one-off change that's then going to disrupt things down the line i i would agree with that but they state we will share the findings of this task force on september 1st so if they want to try to see anything they're never going to change anything until the next season probably when they change the code again which is which is just saying we're going to tell you what we're going to do with the game changes and then we may implement something like it is a very weak statement but but i mean the the three key things that are going to be discussed are one how much money are we going to lose if we do this versus how many of the customers that we care about are we going to lose if we do this versus what is the risk of breaking the game if we make these changes for things that we expect to do down the line in the future those are the three things that they have to end whichever is the most impactful is the one that's going to make the decision so two things one i guess i give them the benefit of the doubt because they have to go to the pokemon company so if like i if they if they put this on their website and not on pokemon go live even though this is literally talking to only pokemon go players it it just makes it seem like maybe the pokemon company company itself who has to approve what they do maybe they're being maybe they're being hard to work with and maybe niantic is telling themselves they need time to work with the pokemon company and there's language barriers there there's time zone differences we've known in the last five years anything they do has never been fast i i work for a multinational company i know if it is incredibly important and customer impacting it doesn't matter what time zone it is you are forced to get up at a 3 am call because you are a multinational company i agree high up and so to say that oh it's because they have to work multinationally is a cop-out that doesn't exist it is something that people think oh it's got to be hard and there's translation issues literally every large company that deals with working in the world has to do this this is why going into languages is very important it's why having people who can speak both languages is incredibly important it's so that you can respond to market changes and switch and it is a signal of their reluctance and reliance on people thinking oh the pokemon company controls all these things and it must be so hard to talk to them because i certainly don't speak japanese that is that is not true if that is true for your company you need to fix your company foundationally i don't think it's if you can't language that is hard i think it's just they're difficult to work with but even then pokemon company also can't is also can't just be like well we'll just take our time like these are things they can i mean they can but these are things that start to ruin their brand right like these are things that begin to tick away on people's reliance of them and it is it is a bad look to to not be able to pivot it is a bad look in in the face of a global crisis to say it's going to take us weeks to figure something out because weeks we don't have weeks really we are in a very bad situation right now and in an exponentially growing thing if you are giving off the message that these actions are fine when they really aren't and out of the other side of your mouth saying we really care about your health and safety they don't align yes and your brand gets damaged and people think well what are you bad at are you lying or are you just bad at being a company clearly like customers two days before go fest new zealand had like a 24-hour lockdown because they had a case so to be like we're we care about your health but in new zealand it's fine but it's like it's not new zealand's not fine they've had like three lockdowns in july and luckily enough they've been short lockdowns but second thing is i lost my train of thought uh for the second thing but the first thing was okay so the part about like bringing new people in to evaluate and stuff that bothered me the thing that like doesn't bother me probably as much as other people is the distance itself like if everything was fine if i could if i could book a trip to japan next week if i could buy tickets to well i guess technically i could buy tickets to packs but i have no interest in doing that greg canceled his gen con stuff if things were normal and i think we all want normal i i don't think people would be as upset but i'm not even like upset about the distance i gave that situation earlier about being inconvenienced and like at the end of the day it's really not that big of a deal because it's just a single palchio raid it's like whatever the thing that bothers me is just their like it's just the communication it's just five years of them taking weeks or or a month to change something or not telling us like i can just think of so many situations where it's like well jeez why didn't you say this or why is it you turn gimbal shiny and it's been shiny for a week but you didn't tell us like like again i understand that you need approval from the pokemon company i'm just gonna assume that they're hard to work with maybe they don't know how to check email quickly i i don't know what's happening over there i don't know if if the pokemon company i don't know if it's your fault and the pokemon company needs to be stricter i don't know if the pokemon company is too strict and they need to like just trust you in making decisions i we we know that that partnership exists and i get it in a business sense niantic's never going to throw the pokemon company under the bus even though it could be them the pokemon company is never going to throw niantic under the bus even though it could be them my second point was we don't know how much glue pokemon go is held together with like in a really good example is there was a balance update in unite they fixed the amount of damage that sludge bomb hex did and then after that update we found out that hex ended up being broken they quickly fixed hex like it took them what three four days to fix hex now all of a sudden garchomp is broken and garchomp is like unplayable and unite so i i get it maybe your game is so broken on the back end that you do need three weeks to figure this all out maybe who knows want i i am so frustrated with niantic i want to give them the benefit of the doubt that again to me it's not even the distance i just want them to like if it takes you three weeks to come up with a better way to communicate to us a more efficient way to communicate to us and going forward you're like this is our new initiative of how we talk to people how we get messages out there the pokemon company or whatever has approved that this is how we can communicate going forward that is what i want i want them to just figure their stuff out and then like it's almost like we're going to couples therapy with niantic like you have issues and we have issues and it's going to take time but we're going to we're going to set aside every bad experience here we're going to start fresh on september 1st and we're going to save this marriage the marriage of my wallet to you to get slightly different color pokemon like i am optimistic about that and if it takes three weeks for us to get to there cool what i don't actually think and i tweeted this would it be nice and would it solve problems now to flip that switch yes but i don't think that is the actual issue like every single year after go fest ever we always come out of gofest being like gofest was incredible and then there's this huge issue we focus on it's been five years of this and so yeah them flipping the switch it just gives in to all the people complaining and their valid complaints but what then stops those people from doing that the next month what's our next issue that we're all going to band together and complain what's our next issue that we're going to do i think there is some balance of like well we can't completely get in but also we've been messing up for five years i don't know what that looks like but it but like i i think that the issue isn't necessarily the distance although that is an issue the actual issue is their communication so you know people at the harvard business school call them up tell them they need to do a white paper nobody can say no to the harvard business yeah tell them they have to do a white paper on niantic then we will get our answers i i the the only thing i take umbrage with your example is if your community your customer base comes together and says this is an issue in your game and it is stopping us from playing the way you present that is like well the company should just ignore them that is not a good situation like if there was a universal thing where people actually said this is making things unsafe in this game and then we got that fixed and then they said okay now this next thing is also something that's unsafe in your game or it's making it difficult to play your game like that is all feedback from your actual customer base these are the people that use your product and you should perhaps listen to them and if it is not possible or there is a valid reason why you're not going to do it communicate that back but you saying then what's the next thing they're going to have to be fixed where are the people playing your game like we are the ones that are giving you feedback about this product if all of milwaukee went down and all of milwaukee said we can't use our cell phones i'm not going to say at t don't fix milwaukee because then what are we going to have to fix next let milwaukee die without any telecommunications i mean it's just milwaukee it's just milwaukee milwaukee it's just this core group of people who pay us lots of money who actually are helping us spread the word of this game and giving us free advertising let them rot on the vine because our principles are more important that is not a good look for any cut i don't think it's our principles are more important i think that's the bait and switch what it is is we're not going to actually lose any money if we don't change anything i think the the only thing that i would say is they made so much money during a pandemic with these things in place it seems inconceivable that you would decide to jeopardize that by actively angering your customer base yeah again i just think that like if everything was perfect and they did this it wouldn't have been that big of a deal but they shouldn't have gotten to the point they shouldn't have gotten to the point where they just let this flip this lay they let this switch flip because again like you said greg they start off saying we care about your health and safety and we want players to play safely i i get it like if we could not worry about wearing masks and not worry about sanitizing well you should probably all be always washing your hands i mean the person that just said you're not washing your hands to eat oreos so don't even come at me with you like if if everything was perfect and i could travel to france right now i don't think it would have been that big of a deal but because things have gotten worse since the 4th of july you can't say you're monitoring the situation and then just leave it so again i i'm frustrated i am hoping for three weeks the distance change doesn't negate the things that you say you're there for that's the other part that's super wild about their statement like you haven't proven that dropping it from 80 meters to 40 meters does anything that you have stated that it does it just made it safer in a lot of cases and to drop it doesn't you have not ever stated what the benefits are other than we think you would meet more people that way the benefits are that more people pay for remote raid passes and they get money i mean that's that's sort of the negative view and i i don't even remember if we said this on this program i've talked about this on twitch but like the the other issue is you they seem to punish all of us instead of rewarding oh they they have a very set way of playing their game and i respect that and i've said this on the show before their game is about going outside and walking and that is a unique thing to their game and it's a thing that makes their game fun it's a thing i personally enjoy i if you're in a wheelchair if if you're bedridden if you're on crutches obviously you can't do the walking part i get that you also probably can't play dance dance revolution or or all these other games i get that just just to just add on that if you're mobility impaired i i suspect very few mobility impaired people started playing last year because of these changes right they started playing because it was easier for them to play i i don't think that happened i think that did happen yeah i want to see the numbers on that i think i think i think more people started playing at home because they did make it easier to play at home that's why their sales their numbers were so high because it's like oh i'm i can't leave my house but i can reach a pokestop or there's really good spawns here or an incense actually works for the first time what was i saying okay yeah so i i have a respect for games that stick to what they want their game to be they want the niantic has been very clear they want their game to be go outside and walk and i i i that's why i let go i've said before i don't like sitting in a car driving to stop to stop that's not fun to me obviously you could play that way not the way i like to play it and when i am at home i always just think to myself there's better games i can play on my couch that isn't go like i sincerely think go is kind of a bad game when you're sitting at home and playing that being said there are people who like to sit at home and play go i i just think there are better games i would just rather play sword and shield or apex legends or pokemon unite or pokemon snap or like literally any game that doesn't involve me walking outside i can play at home that's my rant but if pokemon go is your favorite game and you love playing on the couch more power to you that being said we're all getting punished because niantic doesn't like people playing on the couch which is fine they made a game they want people to play the game the way but instead of punishing everyone give me more rewards for playing the game how you want me to play it and the biggest thing i can think of is the your game is about walking i like to walk i've been streaming a lot of go on twitch i let me tell you we're walking like 12 miles a day when we're doing that and it's awesome like i feel good after it i'm covered in sweat it's like it's a great time sometimes you gotta work off some calories greg no that's the whole concept of you covered in sweat that's just gross that's why i'm not a sweat person why is it that if i walk 50 kilometers in a week which is their top reward i get like nothing for it i get like one 10k egg if i have the room to hold the 10k egg i get some stardust which like doesn't even matter when it comes to like a stardust event i get like 40 pokeballs okay look i'm walking 50 kilometers this week pokeballs ain't my ain't my problem like reward us for playing your game the way you want us to play it if i'm walking 50 kilometers give me something good like give give the people on a couch a reason to be jealous of the people walking like why are your rewards so bad for the people who are out there in the sun sweating the people who are seeing new stops the people who are putting in the the like it's all bad like reward your players that are not on the couch instead of punishing everyone here's the problem the people who are walking the walkie players are also the people who are willing to put money into the game the couch players are not willing to put money into the game i think the couch players are willing to pull money though they're the ones that are they're the ones that are doing incense and not leaving their house like think of how many people in the last year of this pandemic did not go out for go fest or sorry did not go out for community days not because it wasn't safe in their area it has been pretty safe to go outside at a park and play versus you know going inside but think of how many people just didn't leave community leave their house for community because they could just pop in incense catch three shinies in an hour and i don't know what those numbers are i i want to see the the calculations i want to see the graphs the charts like make incense better for people walking make the 25k a week the 50k a week introduce 100k a week like make all of these rewards better because if somebody wants to sit at home and get 0 or 3k because they're sitting at home but they're playing your game why do i feel like me playing your game properly i'm doing air quotes for the audio version why am i why do i feel like i'm still not getting like anything for playing your game right like hey niantic i don't care that you change it from 80 to 40. i'm out here but also if this is how we're playing why why am i still feel like i'm getting punished when i'm playing it the way you want me to play it you're getting the pleasure of being outdoors and enjoying your environment and i like that go takes me outside i really do but the the game had it i don't know i'm shrugging my shoulders i like this game a lot i really do it's it's like probably top three all-time pokemon games for me i've been playing it for five years i love it i i would like to play it for another five years oh you will you will but i i personally have a problem with okay if you're if if you want us to play the game the way you want us to play it why why do we why do we just feel like we're still getting punished even though we're because because some people want to play on the couch who cares let them play on the couch if they want to spend 250 every two hours to do three remote raids let them spend the money but i'm out here sweating i'm out here walking i'm out here connecting with people i'm out here spinning your stops i'm out here visiting starbucks which is your sponsor gym and i'm getting one purple egg a week and that's all i'm getting for it geez come on niantic what do you want from me how much more can i do to play your game the way you want me to play it and feel like i'm still getting screwed at the end of the day i don't know it sucks and all the people that are like well stop playing that doesn't matter the only thing that matters is money okay don't give niantic money i don't [Laughter] i've given them a hundred dollars once this year and i've already spent that money so like or not spent that money but it's already converted to coins so i can't i'm not giving them money i hope that september 1st has something good all right dang this show is too long let's take a break i want to talk like 10 minutes unite question of the week pokemon of the week [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh god [Music] we are back we're gonna talk about some unite uh i will say that two things classic our new podcasts two things number one is that we had a unite bonus episode on our premium feed so if you head over to our patreon page if you want two bonus episodes a month um and and you want ad free episodes of ise you can head over to patreon.com pkmncast and for five bucks a month you get ad free you get two bonus episodes where you can listen to our new unite episode that we did 45 minutes on uh and then you get to join our slack community and support the show and we're almost i think up to 500 patrons so geez thank you guys so much this is like the highest amount of patrons we've ever had and there hasn't been a good pokemon game in a while minus you know snap and unite and look starting shield's pretty old now so i just appreciate everyone who has signed up from our sign up for our patreon with that being said we are running a special promotion on our patreon where we're doing a little gift package for anyone at the 25 or higher level so if you sign up before august 18th you'll get a exclusive shirt and some other goodies and a package i'll i'm getting those shirts printed locally uh and i'll be packing them so it'll probably be the death of me because uh mailing stuff is time consuming but i want to really make these like little packages to you guys like feel special um shirts are normally like 20 bucks looks like free shipping so it's kind of like a wash for me like it's not really a profit but um if you want to get one of these shirts uh it's to anyone at the 25 level uh the reason i'm ending it at august 18th is because then i need to get all the sizes and then we need to send

episodes and let's just spend a little time on unite uh and then we'll do question of the week i know the show's already longer than it should be but i thought the niantic thing was pretty important um so we're like week going into week three of unite i think will's given up on it no i play it every day [Laughter] what do you mean just because i don't play ranked doesn't mean i don't play unite are you still having a good time non-ranked yeah i'd love to get in there with my snorlax did you buy the floatie i have not given that game a cent oh yeah you haven't even done battle pass right correct greg is very into unite which is the shocking reveal why is this shocking you keep saying it's shocking why is this shocking i need you to explain to your knight which means you have to hate unite we don't like greg we just expect you to be a responsible adult not a moba player i am a responsible adult i look there's nothing i think the show has proven greg we never see eye to eye well that's because you're always wrong my like of unite has nothing to do with you dragging me down when you're like carry me and i try and you are such hot garbage we lose are you kidding me no no wait i don't see you at all in any of our games until the last two minutes [Laughter] i believe if okay so i know you don't get mvp a lot because you're a healer but almost every game we've played together greg i am almost always mvp uh i'm not being sarcastic twice twice i don't get mvp except for my amazing mvp last night which is the crowning and unite achievement of my life look we're not here to brag about who's getting mvp and who's not uh can we brag about how i'm a much higher level than you yeah you also probably have like 200 more games than i do how many games do you think you're up to you do it for living i can look because i just had to put it on yeah no like everyone always says this you play pokemon for a living you play pokemon for a living these people in my twitch channel they have like 300 more games than i do because they don't have to like consistently edit or market themselves they just play video games really good full-time job and a part-time job yeah but you have promoting an rpg right how many games you got uh what i have in the spreadsheet is i have played a spreadsheet look at you guys guys have all time little little spreadsheet a hundred spreadsheet what are you using there's no spreadsheet for no way you have 180 games i had 190 games like five days ago maybe i entered it in wrong do you want me to go down and get my thing no we don't have time for this i mean it's just downstairs okay you go get it what are you tracking in the spreadsheet i'll talk about the whole i'll talk about updates all right so they did their first uh balance update which i i was wrong about i didn't think we'd get a balance update for like a month it's been two weeks but they did a balance update they i made a little graphic for it but they took pokemon that weren't really being used like talonflame and they they bumped him up um charizard they bumped him up they left a lot of pokemon alone like nine tails and pikachu um they like kind of nerfed crammer at but like i i've talked to a lot of crimer players including myself it just doesn't feel any different when you say like nerf maybe we should explain this when something gets nerfed it usually means like a stat goes down so in the example does less damage moves less quickly yes so for like cramer ant whirlpool which is it's a movie you only get into level six and then you stop using it it did like 4 700 damage and then they changed it to 4 300 damage and honestly it's like it's not even noticeable um and then they took some pokemon and they they did so like they took pokemon that were controversial like gengar and i guess this maybe just shows that people don't understand fully what what's going on but they when you look at the little thing i make it gengar has two up arrows and one down arrow up arrows meaning buff down arrow meaning nerf and they took the move that everyone hated hex and they made hex do less damage which is everyone wanted but then it made sense that they buffed the move shadowball because no one used shadowball so you want the tool set on your pokemon to be viable with whichever way they go like if you nerf hex but you don't do anything to shadowball people are still not going to use shadowball right you want both paths to be good and they did that with kramer ant right like no one was really using dive on cramaran so they increased they made dive a little bit stronger um move uh which i would say was the problem with xero aura not really discharged discharge is like yeah it's its main move but you can see it you can walk away from it i mean zera aura is meant to be a very close-up character so if you keep your distance or you wait till discharge is used you can then go in and get sarah aura but yeah they nerfed its unite move which yeah its unite move was very good um [Music] and then with gossip fleur they nerfed um the shields i think it was the shields right but they buffed the ones that people weren't using yeah which i don't know if you've that you've tried those since greg no i still don't use them um i still like i have seen the things like well everybody uses elder goss and i'm like the reason why everybody uses zelda gus is eldergast is literally the only character that does direct healing right so it's really hard to say that elder goss was out of balance healing wise when nobody else heals um the the biggest change is shields used to be on i think it was a five seconds cooldown and it's on a nine second cooldown uh so it's harder to it's harder to recover in emergency situations um but uh i'm i haven't like i still don't think the other two things are have been buffed enough to be worth it like cotton spore requires you to be pretty close to things and i think that was like a five second to a four second yeah it's just it's just not ideal like the minute they see elder goss they go straight for aldegas because they need to kill the healing um and my official games is 283. 283 yeah gee i just checked i was at 182. you have 100 more battles than me holy cow that's a lot of battles greg what i play the game no it's it's it's it's so weird that i had this disconnect that you weren't a competitive person and then i like erased all the clash royale in my mind where you like okay you pull that from board games in which i don't like being competitive with the people you play board games with and you don't care anything about like competitive and like sword and shield no uh that really stresses me out also because i have a i have i have issues with how the meta is designed like i really have like struggling finding connections to pokemon that are good in metas so it's hard for me to to want to run teams of pokemon that i don't feel a connection to i feel like um so like there are different reasons but yeah like i am so i am a very competitive person which i also need to keep that in check just so that i don't become the person that i hate uh but unite has a as a supporter role i get i still get frustrated but like i am not i unite helps me feel like i'm a part of a team in ways that other competitions don't and that helps me feel like i'm trying to support and go with things as a team uh and the sort of flip-floppy nature of mobas is just you lose a lot right like it's you're just gonna run up to people who just are better all the time um and i've found i found pokemon of a limited roster that i feel connected to that i enjoy playing and it the fact that i can quick jump in and play for 10 minutes and then finish my lunch with a 10 minute match and then go back to work is fun for me it's just fun to do and i don't feel unite is so hyper competitive toxic that i feel that toxicity while playing the game yeah i mean you're you're always gonna just run into teams that are better than you um and that that's fine and whether they paid or not is it probably doesn't matter because they're gonna be better than you regardless yeah um or get randomly placed on a team of people who do absolutely nothing yeah i i i still we were we were joking about mvp earlier but i would still prefer to be the worst on the team um because because i know what it feels like to be the worst right like and i think with unite um or any other competitive game like you see like uh you'll see somebody like oh they scored no points or they didn't get any really kill and like like knocking out slash killing whatever you want to call it like it doesn't actually matter in this game like it's not like you getting 13 knockouts look hallelujah say it again the game is not about killing your opponents it's about scoring points right fundamental yeah so it like you can brag that you got 20 kills but like it if you didn't score the points like i think that's also why i enjoy playing elder goss is my job isn't isn't just the score really it is to help create opportunities where others can score and i will say when i see somebody who is supposed to be playing an attacker has zero i'm like what were you doing yeah at all like what did he do the killing doesn't completely matter it doesn't come out it doesn't matter in the scoring instance but obviously if you knock somebody out for 30 seconds that's that can be huge but yeah it is making those openings um but what i was what i was saying is like i think even even in a like expert or veteran or something when you you see you were last the team i think it flashes across your mind of like oh i'm the weak link is this why we lost especially if you lose like if you lost and if you were the person with no points on the team or the lowest score you think like oh that is my fault and i would rather be in that position so other people don't feel awful like how can i get everyone up where like okay we lost but it's steve's fault which is like fine so i think i mean i think i think we've been talking to somebody about because i think we've been pretty successful on twitch and greg and i have been playing on twitch together and you know we've lost and we've won um and i and yeah it's like trying not to be toxic or put the blame but when the match is over i do try to explain like okay what went wrong in that match right like and what can we do better and it's not like well we did wrong because greg moved here at four minutes and he should have been here and it's like it's not a blame game it's like i mean i think the one that we messed up the one that i was screaming at the tv was when you all start there's only two of two of you alive and you're attacking zapdos like stop no please stop doing that yeah and that was that was probably the most frustrating part and but that just comes with experience right um because you think like so in the situation we were winning the entire game and it kept saying you have a huge lead you have a huge lead and we all went to zapdos and we hid in the bush like three of us hid in the bush it was great and the team came over and i used my alt somebody else used their alt and we wiped the team but it was they also took a bunch of us out they took out three of you so it was it was me and another person and they started attacking zapdos and i'm i i'm like do we attack it do we not and i didn't attack zapdos because i was pretty weak um and because that person did more than half damage all five of them came in they wiped us two so now it was five verse three because we should have just been hiding in the bush and i was hiding the bush i was just like going back and forth like peeking to see if they were coming and then because they took out half of zapdos health it made it very easy for the team to then finish off zapdos versus right force because that team has to that and this is the thing we have to think about and why i'm explaining it is because i hope it helps our listeners when you're winning so much they have to attack zapdos and if they can't attack zapdos without attacking you they're wasting time and resources on you so the thing about zapdos as well that you just have to think of is zapdos does a lot of damage to you as well like it does like as a crammer ant i cannot solo zapdos as a zero aura i could but zero auras coming out of that less than fifty percent hp um and and really zapdos at full house at 30 seconds less than the game zapdos is no longer time you can't take it out and score a zapdos at full house and then get to the other right like it's effectively done yeah if you have 50 sorry well if you have 50 points and there's 10 seconds you cannot score you need you need like 12 seconds to score 50 points unless it's like the instant score but too much key zapdos key dreadnough strat only the last hit counts let somebody else take the health down you swoop in get that last hit from them steal it from them i mean the other thing i didn't realize until like i've been playing it a lot now and watching people play is just how much everybody needs to go fight drednah like everybody abandon top lane because the amount of experience and levels you get if your team finishes dreadnaught turns the game and if you can get dreadnought twice in a game you are effectively unstoppable and it doesn't matter if they got one goal up top if one person scored 40 points the fact that your team got dreadna is the most important part of that game it it every time dreadnought appears it's like everybody leave go to dreadnought because it's so important to get this boss i would put an asterisk there with everyone needs to go dreadnaught if you're on top and if you're on top i would say almost one person should always go because there should be two up there if their two are staying it's worth it for one to stay up there just to waste those two time those because then it will be four verse three yeah verses five verse three you're going to win that anyways but you're gonna give them so much to do up there and you have to think about this in the game of what there is to do if they're taking the bees you're not if they're taking the core fish you are not but if you're up there distracting them you're still doing something and you're still being important to the team so i do think dreadnought dreadnought is very important because of the level not necessarily because of the shield so you just attacking a pokemon once when that pokemon is defeated you'll get the experience as long as you get a single hit on it um but yeah if they score a little bit in return for the amount the experience wins the game experience a lot of the game i think a lot of people i think when the first game first came out us included we're like zapdos wins the game that's not true no it's a it's like and and it's funny because a lot of youtubers a lot of content creators a lot of people on twitter they talked about how dreadnought was a waste like go back two weeks ago yeah no one cared about dreadnaught yeah um dreadnought everything the conversation was the conversation was so focused on zapdos which is ironic that like they they spent so much time making these mechanics and it only took a little bit for the meta to start forming but if you're a level nine nine tails and i'm a level seven cramarant i lose purely based on level uh if you're a level 120 aura and i'm a level 10 absol you win that's just what it is and so the reason why dreadnought's so important is because everyone who touches it gets that huge experience you almost go up a full level yeah uh if you were just fresh so rotating down to dreadnought is is very important and like i said should everyone rotate yeah but if they're not rotating if they're not rotating up there it's it's nice to leave a snorlax up there or nine tails up there just to like waste their time and again if if they haven't dropped then read the situation if it's a one-on-one just go if it's a one on two and you can waste your time go but if if if you see everybody as god and you're the only person up there get your butt down to dreadnaught yeah i mean if you're the only person up there and i've had it successful where like i'm the only one up there um because i was either late or i didn't have health so me going down there would have died anyways you can still clear everything up there so by the time they get back up they got nothing to work on which is there's still value there but that's where the communication comes in yeah of like hey i can't join you because i got like 25 health and by the time i get there like there's like four zero down there also if you use your ultimate wrong uh just kill something for two points and score because every score no matter how small increases your reset 10 percent so just if you like oop i need my ultimate faster just kill something quick and scoot over you can probably get a two score in and you still get that 10 boost on your ultimate coming back every time you score and you get four percent for killing wild i think so like it is useful to make small scores if your ultimate is vital or going to be super helpful in one of the two boss fights like th there's these little tiny things that you can do to improve your game and like yeah a two score isn't going to move the points but it's going to get you back to things that you need should you have made a mistake earlier or or used it wisely and you just know you're going to need it again like zip over hit hit a two point and get up because the two point is almost instantaneous and it you can kill something small pretty quick and get in there and do it um it's just ways to sort of like use like as we are beginning to learn these mechanics to like be better at the game there's these little things that are very helpful yeah and that's what i'm trying to do with like the graphics and the twitch stuff is just you know help people because once once you understand and enjoy what you're playing it makes the game easier and makes the game less frustrating instead of like somebody in my like twitch chat that was just like oh i just go anywhere and we seem to win that's like yeah yeah although it violates stay that way right i have three rules of what makes a video game that i enjoy i have some rules of what makes a video game that i won't enjoy and having to do homework for the video game is a on that list of things i do not enjoy yeah i i and i think for the most part in unite you don't have to do homework if you baloney i've got to go to your instagram and see all the builds and catch up on this got buffed and this got nerfed and blah blah blah no i i think like if if you just want to play you know nine tails as long as as long as you know that you know nine tails usually goes bottom can go top homework homework because that's not but the game tells the game tells you you should go to the bottom it does tell you absolutely says suggested and recommended okay in your battle prep it does tell you these things like i i made a i made a speedster graphic i was like here are the four speedsters here is the difference between the speedsters and then here if speedsters are recommended for jungle the center and i was like here's the order for jungle if you care to do that you gotta go lilly pup ludacola buffalant corfish but if you have zero desire to play any of the speedsters or cinderace or lu lucario or you just don't like jungle you can ignore that whole graphic or you want to be jungle crystal jungle crystals stop putting those thoughts into people's heads don't ever jungle crustal jungle cram look if you want to run zero or on the top lane you can i am sure i am sure there is some japanese player out there who takes elder goss into the jungle and dominates oh i haven't done jungle goth i don't know what that looks like you probably shouldn't do that but i am sure there is like you can make any role work anywhere if you are good enough that being said most of y'all ain't good enough to do that myself included and it's like and i think there's just like this misunderstanding of and this is why i put the abilities on the um the jungle guide is is like i had some people being like well you forgot cinderease no i didn't forget cinderace this is a speedster guide these are the four speedsters yes you can take cinderace in the jungle why is cinderella's good in the jungle well that would be a whole separate graphic i can tell you why but i'm i i only got so much room on a graphic people have short attention spans i'm focusing on two things speedsters the order you attack them in but why speedsters are called speedsters is look at their abilities like talonflame gets a huge boost when it has full hp because of gale wings gengar when not in battle moves super quickly the whole point of the jungle is to flex between top and bottom can cinderace do this yes but it's not nearly as fast as the pokemon weave well as their aura is not fast it gets like an attack boost or whatever um and that's fine to use cinderease or lucario or garchomp in the jungle but for people who are new knowing why the speedsters are speedsters i feel is an important thing to communicate like homework and and if you're looking at that graphic and you're like i know all this why didn't you include cinerace it's like graphic wasn't meant for you buddy right but yeah i mean yeah all right we've used up our 10 minutes of unite question of the week do you want the question of the week because it's that time again there wasn't a third verse there i mean there could be like i have like five verses but i'm you know okay it's already very long all right this is from kevin name a voice name name an actor you'd like to voice a pokemon or maybe trainer in the live action netflix series full dialogue like ryan reynolds hmm i don't care for actors michael sarah no out banned get out uh i want to see omar sai do clefable i don't know who omar sai is um but what's that uh one girl from not the office parks and rec i think she was like audrey plaza no she was the darker skinned girl but she always i think she was a show writer but also an actor though oh i know here we played i think her name was mina in the show no yeah she had she had her own show yeah she had her own show after parks and rec she's like really funny i don't know i think she's like south asian um yeah oh dagnabbit who did she play was she the nurse was she and no she was like the secretary i don't remember parks and record all that well hold on hold on she had her own show afterwards though are you talking about the actors that played donna no no no no no no no no maybe no we're confusing like eight different women all i'm just trying to figure out what character you're talking about because i've watched a lot of perkins wreck i think i think steve thinks she was on parks and rec but she wasn't oh oh that would help she was on the office oh was it the office yes i see i almost said the office and then i switched to parks and rides are you exciting about um mindy kaling mindy yeah mindy kaley what did what did i say her name was mina nina that was kind of close i got three letters right good for you i guess yeah she seems cool i don't know she is yeah maybe there's some drama but she seems all right i could see her being like a wiggly tough or something she's very sassy i remember her being very sassy on the office edward james almost oh there he is jigglypuff it's always jigglypuff it's never clefable i said clefable what do you say is never complainable i the first thing i did was the fable you are the worst you don't know all right a second question of the week this is off our youtube if you are watching on youtube you want to ask a question there'll be a question of the week thread pinned you can ask a question there we we're we're getting to it um this one is from uh cl clue crutch i don't know how to say that uh it'll say it'll say at the top if you're watching the video feel free to ask your question the week though in the youtube comments is pokemon unite going to stay alive longer than three weeks yes 100 percent people love mobas people love pokemon it is the perfect mix i'll let me let me change let me change their question do you think we're all going to be playing this when uh like diamond pro comes out three months uh so that really depends on how quickly they add things to the game like new characters new maps like if because let's if it is the exact same game uh by the middle of november probably not uh i will probably put in and like i'll do like oh i'm going to do my daily because i still really enjoy the game but like the amount of time that i'm putting into it now if things haven't changed or there's not new characters to try or new maps to play on uh i probably won't be as invested in it uh in four months as i am now so the cycle that i've seen for a lot of people who i would say are like dedicated moba players moba is one of their prime types of game that they enjoy playing it's kind of like a three weeks on three weeks off cycle where there will be updates new like new pokemon will be released something like that they get they get into it they play hardcore for three weeks and then they've like kind of played out that scenario they take three weeks off they wait until the next set of updates they pop back in and it becomes very cyclical in how they play um i think the thing you see on like uh twitch is you see you saw all the dota players all the league of legends players like of course they're gonna try any new moba they're addicted so you see all these like really good other moba players play unite we saw this with pokken tournament too you know all the mortal kombat people the dare alive people the tekken people they came over because they want they always try the newest fighting game and they go yeah this is fine but you know the reason they're addicted to league is because they it's league like league is a more complicated game dota is a more complicated game so i don't like they had fun with poke with unite and then they moved back and their audiences followed them there and they played it for a day or two but we're going to i would assume in the next three weeks three months whatever is the people who are really good at unite will stay really good and they will grow their audiences and the game won't be as big as it was you know the weekend it launched but that's just because so many people tried it and decided that you know they like league better or they like dota better or they like overwatch better or whatever and the people who like pokemon the people who like this simpler version of a moba they'll stick with it um the goal is can you get people on the fence to continue playing it by helping them understand the game easier so they do enjoy it um so then they can get their friends and like family into it as well and i think that's the biggest hurdle is not is not like people leaving but like getting more people into play and hopefully i think characters do that right you know if somebody's favorite pokemon is is hitmonch fan and they add hitmonchan i feel like that's the opportunity there where they go well now i gotta try the game so they do have the advantage of adding pokemon that people care about to play said game so yeah what greg said they keep adding characters i don't think it's gonna die anytime soon pokemon of the week so last week's pokemon was a lot of blah blah blah unite stuff i mentioned the pkm and cast into instagram trying to drive some traffic to that you know kind of flagging not not needs more followers homework instagram account uh homework uh said that uh the best build for this pokemon is focus band muscle band and buddy bear i'm a big fan of buddy barrier i like buddy which is not an item that's found in other games some people say this pokemon is based on a cat but it's mostly more likely based on the hibernating bear and then i described what uh buddy barrier does and also the fact that you can no longer uh get toxic onto this pokemon in galler only in previous iterations of the pokemon games can this pokemon have toxic it's munchlex is not in unite it's snorlax yes well i knew the answer i just had to say it wrong hmm did we do snorlax's point of the week look look we keep 10 years now will is on the same release schedule as pokemon go is for pokemon it will never be keklia i've done kecleon we'll never get larvesta vesta go shiny is good uh shuffle is outstanding uh magikarp jump icon is also very good magikarp jump icon yeah oh it is very good imagine why would i lie to you some trivia in pokemon stadium series and later 3d games snorlax will open their eyes when they faint and pokemon snap snorlax will stan this is not trivia pokemon snorlax stands up and dances when the music flute is you yeah sure and heart gold soul silver people like that video game if the player interacts with snorlax that is walking with them at mount silver the message snorlax is very eager will appear this is due to red who is also out mount silver owning a snorlax as well while the player is on mount silver unique messages will also appear if the snorlax is if if the player is walking with a pikachu or a charizard i didn't actually know that uh in pokemon gold and silver snorlax is programmed to learn charm through breeding but no other pokemon in the monster group can legitimately learn it really great coding back in the day good old gold and silver to pass down as an egg move in generation three and on snorlax can inherit the move from bulbasaur by chain breeding is the only evolutionary family to have all of its members appear from a pokeball within a single smash bros game what kind of garbage trivia look you get thanks bulbapedia used to be an actual twitter account in pokemon gold and silver snorlax is the only pokemon to receive a plus 40 catchphrase modifier when a heavy ball is used that's because heavy ball didn't actually work at all on any pokemon but snorlax well you only had one heavy one it was snorlax in pokemon crystal a bug caused the capture formula for heavy ball to incorrectly retrieve the weight of cadabra tauros and sunflora so they all get the plus 40 modifier catcher oh gen 2 held together with tapes and dreams man that cadaver real thick back there for that heavy ball to work the cadabra boy all right what about next week all right this pokemon which could only appear in your party after you had passed through route 102 in the old days has a split evolution but in pokemon unite can only evolve into one of the two options because duane stones are not available in pokemon unite conceptually one of the pokemon it can evolve into can be either male or female while the other can only be male both of its subsequent evolutions have their own megas at this point i feel that i have given you enough information but i'll add one more thing to make it perfectly clear the word used for its category is a synonym for the word used for its pre-evolutions category that's it that's all more than enough information perfect already knows the answer hope you enjoyed your extra long show thank you for listening uh as i do our outro greg is going to think of a secret word but you can follow greg on time [Laughter] but you got that at the front uh greg is that white wing will
