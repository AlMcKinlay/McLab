[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 408 episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SBJ here correct episode correct podcast will also hear correct episode correct podcast I I know actually he's supposed to be on a different podcast but you preempted with this particular program but you know I guess also sometimes it snows in May so who knows what's going on in the world anymore Greg knows what's going on in the world I do know what's going in the world and I'm not gonna tell you because I'm mad at all of you for not telling me about the Pokemon zoom backgrounds oh my word it's not important to my life I'm no way assuming you have a lot of Pokemon a lot of zoom calls look I run at least two RPGs on two different days that you zoom and I play jack box games sometimes through zoom so don't start with me I actually bought the thing to have a monthly zoom meeting so I could run games so there the what are the the Zoomers is that what we're calling people who you zoom no no it's called we are not employed people because that's pretty much the only option nowadays what are you gonna do Microsoft teams I don't think so yeah that's that's where you think Brit Brit is here yes broader rod just to talk about Microsoft TV Microsoft teams expert yes four of us we didn't think Greg would make it so he pulled Brittany but Greg roped rope their way back into tonight's show I don't think that's not an expression but sure definitely not holding you hostage but if I were people listening it's a million dollars to get Steve back just no one's paying that much for me I know it's been a long long time it's been like a year even your wife is like no it's okay it's true yeah well in the lost cause we got some Pokemon news for you guys today we got some NGO news some master news some people love it the hot and heavy sales number news is from Nintendo I think we're gonna start off our Pokemon news though with two breaking points number one metaphors sprinkles of illusion and simile free shipping on Pokemon Center calm that's that's point number one breaking news breaking point thank you breaking news breaking point I think was like a TCG set up was break point break point break so even if you order like a $10 plush free shipping and storm only 50 bucks could be dangerous if you like Pokemon merch number two breaking point number two is rad boot drizzle thwack II sir fetch gallery' and Ponyta cram rant and Polti guys plushies have been added to the Pokemon Center that crammed rant so good I actually have not been impressed by the new Galera and stuffed animals especially the obstacle I think that thing looks terrible if you give that to your child it's basically telling your child that you don't like them and you're very disappointed in them ya know the poltergeist the fact that the cracks and holes aren't real like it's not it's just painted on the outside so it's still a perfect sphere I'm having difficulties the cracks a really low effort on this Polti guys they're just black lines I mean but they did put in a ton of work for Kramer and I don't think that one has looked better it's got a great smile yeah look you know I know you're being malicious here the the sir fetch they did put in the work they did put in the work for sure Fred sure fresh they put in the work the shield is like great it's like they didn't cop out like the Polti guys thing the leak they got the onion popped like everything about it the the eyes they somebody was their budget was like here's a thousand dollars to design these plushies and the first the the first thing they designed was sir fetch and then they were like oh we only have fifty bucks left for our budget so I'm gonna use this and stretch it across Kramer ant mmm Polti guys over here hmm you really got the short end of the stick that's not too bad I like the point I won if anyone's pretty good I like it the first time I saw it and it was called My Little Pony it still called okay okay you have to put by both more peco's don't you cuz it doesn't change it's not like they did a cool thing you make it inside out they received a Aiden inside out more more Petco more Pico I still don't how to say this thing I thought they made it inside one out in Japan they also made a Kramer aunt with a fish in its mouth in Japan but they didn't bring that over I too offensive for the American market also because of Japan's really mad that we didn't tell them about the national dex so we think it's uh for a while they're holding out the good pushes on us well and also Japanese people don't realize that people eat sushi over here so the whole concept of raw fish they're like well we can't let the Americans see raw fish they'll think that there's something culturally wrong with that I mean there is but would you stop I had a delicious sushi for lunch my sushi delivery right now but it's all vegetables I feel like you're not doing it right then why is sushi sushi there's no raw fish yes I mean I get written in Japan there is vegetarian sushi so I stand corrected all right full disclosure I am partnered with DNA no we're gonna talk about this are we I'm not excited to talk about this full disclosure I'm not excited to talk about this this is Pokemon masters - game calm which yes is the official website for Pokemon masters before we get into this will you still fly masters no I only have room for one gotcha game in my life and it has become Vanguard zero but I can co-write with my vanguard zero experiences okay alright Greg still playing masters that I'll have to ask that question Brittany are you playing masters at all no it's it's can't keep up with it fair enough I'm real mad at it right here we go message get ready to play even less because yeah I guess you're not technically wrong that's what they're doing volume 10 greetings trainers we are the producers of Pokemon masters us a sec sake I think as I say it and to tsuya Iguchi here with a new message for you this time we are excited to share the details about the legendary arena and new feature and future updates new updates to tactics and team optimization have you been making use of the new tactic feature we introduced in April's update no okay I didn't look at it and I don't really know how to use it with the tactics you can control the order in which the opponent's target your members all we know I did do this I did do this I actually needed to do it for the silver thing them targeting Milotic first was actually very helpful by using this feature to protect your vulnerable sync pairs you can now battle with an extra layer of strategy we hope you find that this feature useful in the upcoming battle villa and the upcoming legendary arena we've also updated the team optimization setting to be even better at assembling the best sync pair of lineups for you use it along with the tactics to create a strategical sound team all at once I will say that feature was very good I didn't know that was a new feature though how do you do it I haven't liked probably that at all I think when you go into your team this is a good question cuz I did it when uh is it the tactics button you just click on yeah you just click on the tactics button under edit team oh oh okay and then you can pick who is getting hit first and who's getting paid hit last I mean when I was playing I probably would have liked that feature a lot of fun yeah well when there's like certain Pokemon and masters that like need to set up stuff and then they're just dead weight mm-hmm yep and you're like you can you're done you did you did what you needed to do the legendary arena battle parameters are completely new to Pokemon masters the legendary arena opens mid-june and the first battle will be against Entei the battle Villa and the legendary arena are similar in that you have a you have to use a multiple number multiple teams to battle but in legendary arena the number of sync pairs that can join battles in a single day is greater your opponent in the legendary arena will boasts a lot of HP and the HP decreases its attack patterns and status conditions resistances will change which means that different sync pairs will excel at different parts of the battle for the first legendary arena we recommend you pairing your water-type sync pairs okay so those that's out of the way now the tactic thing made it better legendary now coming mid-june Entei power up your water pokemon you probably already did this if you're doing the whole event right now this is what the community doesn't seem happy about oh yeah before we go through this there is a feedback form you can provide them feedback they are listening if you want to send a Gucci and Sasaki Sasaki Sasaki be Blackey because the Japanese team makes these decisions I only work with the English team and they are asking me for feedback as well on this I feel you guys alright here we go plans to improve existing features we have received feedback regarding the amount of time required to train sync pairs since training requires multiple items and only so many items can be obtained from a single battle trainers must complete the same battles several times they heard you Greg in order to streamline the process and provide better balance of time spent to rewards earned we are revisiting the system this all sounds good so far reduce time spent battling for items sounds great reorganize battles that reward items sounds good yeah set a maximum number of playable battles per day no no no why why are you doing this here's a breakdown of what each improvement entails reduce time spent battling for items we are implementing adjustments to sync pairs that join your team this includes having them start with unlocked level caps for certain levels and access to all of their moves and their passive skills we are introducing an item that will allow you to skip battles while getting rewards currently sync pairs needed to be trained for a certain degree for trainers to fully enjoy challenging battles this item these items require the items required to do so can take time to obtain our goal is to streamline the training process so everyone can focus on enjoying exciting battles ultimately we want to reduce the need to auto battle to obtain items reorganizing battles that reward items we are considering reorganizing battles too according of what items they award items for level-cap items for leveling up evolution items and sync orbs and so on setting a maximum number of playable battles a day we are setting a limit on the maximum number of battles that can be played in one day this limit wouldn't apply to all battles only two battles obtaining items to strengthen sync pairs via the battle Villa or other battles with matching such as co-op would not be if affected to balance things out we will drastically increase the number of items can that become acquire in one battle under this new system you'll be able to decide which battles to prioritize with these adjustments we hope to make the training experience much more efficient we are always working hard to deliver updates and improvements that make the world of Pokemon masters as fun as possible we prioritize trainers feedback throughout the development process so don't hesitate to let us know what you think ok that's what we got so far so I didn't hear the word stamina once but you guys said there was a whole stamina thing yeah I guess we don't know fully what right may be the maximum number of battles is like in essence the maximum number of battles per day is what a stamina system is in other games ah so for moat like the my main went rogue all you lost you have a hundred and fifty stamina a day you know top tier battles take ten of those stamina so you can only do 15 battles a day that came however lets you build up so if there's some evidence you want to go to you can build up your stamina and keep it to focus on something that you do want to do which I do hope they do here I was very excited when they say they're introducing an item that allow you to skip battles while getting their rewards and that's what I want that's what everybody wants the biggest problem with this is for like okay I have a sync pair that I'm trying to do the whole event I've got a sync pair I need 750 of a particular bottle and under the current system one battle will give me 20 so I've got like 38 of those battles that I have to do to unlock this next level so that I can get through this whole event which is limited to try like there's is this huge time sink so unless they are going to really ramp up the rewards I mean and they have to make it pretty drastic it's the same problem except the game you off yeah like if they triple it but only give you ten I'm still not able to get what I need to level up I'm you're just telling me to stop plate okay stop playing the game because you're you're done it's almost like a contradiction here like they're they're admitting like yes we know that there's there's so many items that you need to level up these these Pokemon and these these trainers but we're we know this and we're gonna set a cap like it's good that they're increasing the maximum amount that you can get with each battle but I don't see how putting a cap is fixing the problem oh yeah skipping battles yes that's that's helping the process putting caps on it no especially if you're not keeping up with it every single day yeah the only the only glimmer of hope I have is that the reward increase is so huge that they feel the need to level up how fast people can get to the top by putting a stamina like cap on it this is entirely dependent on something they have never shown in the past which is giving out a lot of rewards in okay obviously I've switched over to Vanguard zero um and in Vanguard zero they actually do use the word stamina and you you level up as you play the more you play your grade increases right so I'm very low grade right now but as your grade increases your stamina your maximum stamina increases and you use your stamina to play matches but the actual like thing that you pay cash money for in Vanguard zero is the thing that lets you refill your stamina so that you can do more matches and get rewards so it's not really like a limit on the number of games you can play per day because you can pay cash money to refill your stamina and play more games so is that diff print from what's happening here so right now money can only be spent to pole sink pairs and to sometimes get some items since there's no main character there's no levels like you do have a player character but you could ignore your player character for all the other sync pairs so there's nothing like oh I've got a level 5 player character so if I need to get more stamina do I need to get my player character in Pikachu up to a hundred to max out my stamina but I have all these others out of hundreds so like there that that that's sort of how other games do it is a weird fit here mm-hmm adding in pay money to play more I mean we don't know we don't know if that's the thing right we don't know that that's the thing but if they do that I mean they're already ripoff artists with the amount that you have to pay for gems like adding that in is I mean there's very few ways this can be implemented that I that actually helps the game it doesn't hurt it yeah I mean we could be overreacting and it could be okay I mean we've I know Greg has complained about the amount of times we just have to like sit here and do auto battle and I think maybe people who really want silver and ho-oh or maybe experiencing that right now and we haven't really talked about the silver in whole event but they do this thing where every like four hours you get three bonus like three bonuses applied to the auto battle so it's actually kind of nice because it's just like lets me know when I can come back which is almost kind of like them testing this out maybe or maybe this was like a precursor to that because I mean if I get four coins or whatever when I complete a battle normally or if I just wait the four hours I can get so I can get twelve or if I do it when it's like the bonus time I can get thirty and then it's just like okay well I'm done I'll get my 30 I'll come back in like four or five hours I don't get another 30 and it's been a nice way for me to do the whole event and I was able to get hoo today just by doing that twice a day for a week I would wake up do my 3 auto battle bonus coins and then right before I went to bed I could have been doing it more I just forgot and right before I went to bed I did my three auto battle thing it was nice to interact with Pokemon masters that way and I did really bad polls in the loot box one and then Liu box - I got really bad polls and I got lucky for number three I got the hoo ticket thing right away and the number four I got the ho ticket thing like right away and I was able to get ho-oh just by doing one set of threes in the morning and one set of threes at night and I thought that was a really great experience but if maybe you weren't super lucky or maybe you would just wanted to get hoo on day one I can see it being very bad like no one wants to do the same battle all day every day for the luck of getting hoo but I thought this event was good but it also kind of seems like this event was a test period for what they're about to do well so this this this event was the improvement event so in previous events like this you would only get the bonus once on each level and then you wouldn't get the bonus again for 24 hours so you for like the Mewtwo event you'd have to do level 1 level 2 level 3 level 4 you'd get the bonus for each of those and then it was done for 24 hours so with the new system I can do 3 on very hard or whichever the second from the top is I can do that 3 times and max that out then try to do my pulls I'm not thrilled with the pull system like the randomizing of are you lucky are you not because I've been pretty unlucky on all of them it's been in 3 or 4 bolts to get the ticket on each one and still don't have it for the third I think the items like giving you in the prize box are pretty oh I mean like eventually you can't pull like bad items anymore right I mean so the I like the items are better is still a little bit random the fact that it's on a 4 hour the improvements are it's on a 4 hour time and you can pick the level on which they all happen instead of having to do all them again like those are huge improvements yeah like the whole event is more is more fun it is still very grindy because it really depends on your luck on the polls I think the polls at least for me where have been exciting because I like opening stuff so it's like how did I get the ticket no I didn't yeah I mean so that has been a huge improvement what's worrying about this is putting it cap on that so let's say the one that you're doing takes ten stamina and you have a hundred stamina you're not you know I'll do it three times I'll do it three times I'll do it three times into that then I'm out it's weird to have made this improvement that gets you to play the game more and then be implementing a system that will say but only so much I lost you spend money which is again they haven't said that that's most they haven't so this stance anemometer is like here's money up to get past that did refill that but I feel like the whole event conditions you to say like and games need to sometimes do this of like hey you can grind this if you want but come back in like four hours I think I did that for most people anyways is such a philosophical problem with the concept of auto battle it's like I came here to play a game I like not about a lot - yeah but you're it's it's like it's you've been brainwashed into thinking in the previous game though having to play a level that you are 50 times more powerful than isn't fun it is just eating up my time at that point yep I don't know but but that's like that's that's the combination floor of we have we we now are living in an era of games that never end there is no final satisfaction I've defeated the final boss I have triumphed over this game you're just gonna be playing for you the chain is around your neck you're playing forever and but not only are you playing forever and it's like well now I'm level 200 but I got nothing to do but do level five things over and over not only that but now you're having the thing by itself and it's like it shouldn't but you shouldn't that's what I'm saying they should introduce something that can say like have I need these rewards and I played it let me skip it don't yeah they should they should introduce an end and it's like all right I got some mobile games yeah I mean I I was definitely very satisfied when I got home and it was a combination of again I was I was very lucky in some of my polls but I I did enjoy waking up knowing that I would get 12 tokens three times and then the thing would go on cooldown and then I was like I get to open three loop boxes and it's possibly how oh and I did that for eight days and I got hota day so like I did feel satisfied getting home it was exciting for me to get something good in the morning good before I went to bed but but like that quest line I think on top of me finding the ho mechanics pretty pretty okay honestly and and my battle my three battles were Auto battles the fun for me was like building the team to do hoo and then and I honestly think the ho story is very good like I think the story they tell between silver and Ethan and silver having a pure heart I think everyone knows what silver well look the reward is silver and hoo I think we all know that ho goes with silver at the end but I think the story that they do in masters for ho is very good and it adds a lot of character to silver which you know is kind of portrayed as like a thief in gold and silver there is lower about silver outside of that but not like specifically in the game you kinda have to read about it and stuff um but they it's my favorite part of masters is the lore that they introduce they do a lot of great story building like the there's one section where he talks as well server talks about his dad and then you see they cut - cut - Giovanni kind of going somebody talking about me yeah no that was probably very very charming um Otto battle thing if I'm gonna be forced to grind something over and over that's gonna be the same no matter what I would prefer afraid to be Auto on some level you're only forced to grind because you have signed that contract with the only way to win is not to play at all and what's the weird dude with the cowboy buta forum who's like I just saw a hole over there and I told it to stay still and it flew away I'm like oh boy you know you talk about clay video starts up when they first introduced hoo into the game I don't remember this at all oh dude was chasing hoo and then he's like standing in a cave and he's like oh it's like a balls dude or something and he's like I can tell my master that I found this bodyguard cowboy type shirt on well also I just realized Milotic maybe shouldn't die first maybe it was Sam erat that was the weak the weak link on my team oh yeah samurai samurai sacrifice amirite all right yeah yeah it's all there to do speed get to low health so you bump everybody up Wow Milotic traps everybody in we're a pool and yeah Feraligatr wrecks house yeah for Alligator real good samurai samurai I really I really do like the ho but Milotic is a disappointing partner a little bit yeah I don't know who else you would put I mean it's the best option I just think there are the younger nuchal maybe run Palpa toad and yeah the miracle move is is pretty bad I mean the only way like the only way mere coat is is very good is if you make sure meiotic is targeted first and you somehow make sure that Milotic goes very fast like his first out of the gate but it still it eats up so much of your bar to just set up a reflect and you don't know what if it's gonna be the two losers or hoo that's gonna hit you it's not crazy pony Todd and slugma somewhat funny puns like mine ain't really helping ha I got my hey we're here too you're like YouTube go into a whirlpool I'll never think about you again I'm gonna download it again for loose an extinct sinkhole Brittany don't do it save yourself you got yourself these shackles every time I hear someone to talk about it that's when I open it up again well we'll play Monster Hunter together Brittany I'm playing Monster Hunter again download Vanguard zero No - yeah at zero is real good oh look who's chained now sir I mean if they just did some very interesting mechanics I pay zero in the today and guard zero and I pile your answers but for how long will you be paying serious the only game that I put money into is garden scapes so that his garden scapes you're gonna sit here on your high horse meanwhile that a horse is stuck in garden skips that you haven't left for fifteen years and four thousand dollars later garland escapes hasn't been around for 15 years we talk about Pokemon go we will be right back you are the worst Microsoft they had the best presentation because they had this voice that kept saying exclusive exclusive [Music] [Music] before we get to Pokemon girl stuff cuz we already spent 30 minutes talking about mobile game let's talk about something more interesting sales numbers yeah yeah because we are all investors on the board apparently then write about sales numbers this is Nintendo live.com Nintendo switch has sold fifty five point seven seven million units worldwide that can't be possible because I can't find one in any store anywhere this is a mess you need to go a slick deals they they show up yes okay Tom Nook wait no it's more like red as away red Nintendo's fiscal year's fiscal year earnings released it's is finally on our hands with updated sales figures consoles and more this is include Pokemon news I promise you the reports revealed that the Nintendo switch has sold 21 million units in the last year putting it at fifty five point seven seven million in lifetime sales software sales have totaled 168 million units which is a 42% increase year-over-year Animal Crossing saw early success and it is uh one of switches top 10 best selling games before we get to sales numbers of video games the we sold a hundred and 1 million hardware units with 921 million software sales the NES sold sixty one point nine 1 million it really just shows how powerful the Wii was sixty one point one nine sixty one point nine 1 million NES is with 500 mm software titles sold and intend to switch 55.77 with 356 million software sales the SNES at 49 million with 379 million software sales the Nintendo 64 at 32 million Gamecube at 21 million and the Wii U at 13 point 5 6 million poor Wii U yeah that didn't sell so well I mean I bought it high fives I have mine I do too still hooked up for no apparent reason since the switch is portable just to compare that to some things here the D s sold a hundred and fifty four million units which is very very impressive of course the 3ds sold 75 million units so the switch is catching up to the 3ds although I don't know if anything's gonna catch the the popularity of the D s maybe switches I mean why she's doing really good but he sure is let's talk about some games Mario Kart I spoil it I should have started from the bottom up well Mario Kart 8 deluxe is the winner it's old put you in charge of content what are we getting a Mario Kart for the switch that is the Mario Kart for the switch that was the remake yeah one that's like a native switch me and my friends can get back into karting hey there's 24 million people that are karting right now maybe well maybe not right now but have carted yeah because those people didn't buy the Wii U maybe that I mean possibly Mario Kart 8 deluxe 24 million Super Smash Brothers ultimate 18 million Legend of Zelda breath of the wild 17.4 1 million super mario odyssey 17 point 4 1 million pokemon sword and pokemon shield 17.3 7 million i think this is besides animal crossing the newest game on the list let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee eleven point nine seven million animal crossing new horizons eleven point seven seven million which is the newest game on the list slit hoon to ten million super mario party why who bought the uh who bought that no you gave it to me for free I didn't pay money for it Super Mario Party 10 million and the new super mario brothers you deluxe which is a wii u game that they poured it over six point six million that my party's not that great no I mean the Mario Party is a real hit or miss it lives and dies on the minigames and the time for mini games are now on mobile so mm-hmm so the real news here is the the Pokemon news right sword and shield as of this recording is six months old seven months old well technically these sales were at the end of the fiscal year which is March I guess we don't know what happened in April and May with when that's when the pandemic stuff started but that's true yeah yeah these numbers are strictly from Nintendo's website they reported on them to their investors so obviously they should be as accurate as possible here if we focus on the sword and shield news specifically Sauron shield sold seventeen point three seven million which if we're not counting red and blue and gold and silver which were the Game Boy games and we're counting everything that is Gen three and higher when they had that split this is the second best selling game again not counting red or blue or gold silver that was some weird 90 success the second best selling game besides diamond a pearl we're told but twenty three million yeah I mean it's pot I don't think sword and shield will ever pass that I don't think any game will ever get to the twenty three million that golden silver head and what the thirty five million that little blue head the initial the initial excitement is over like they made they hit the big numbers and now is just you know somewhere in between where everybody's comfortable diamond pearl seventeen point six seven million and so sword shield is literally number wise three hundred thousand away from passing diamond and pearl which would make it the best-selling game in the last twenty some years of pokemon diamond pearl did real good yeah it's so some I made a chart about this if you want to it's my pin tweet on Twitter if you want to just easily see all the Pokemon sales numbers but when Ruby and Sapphire came out that was a sixteen point to two million diamond and pearl was seventeen point six seven million black and white fifteen point six four million which is very weird because their marketing was out of control for black and white I wouldn't say out of control I would say was just right they they marketed back out of that game but I think you know if maybe if maybe reddit /youtube slash Twitter where we're a big player back then and you you did hear about people being mad that you couldn't have your playthrough of black and white with Charmander you had to beat the game but people were very upset about that fifteen point six four million X&Y sixteen point four five million Sun and Moon sixteen point one eight million and sword and shield seventeen point three seven million so III think that Sauron shields gonna pass time in a pearl they're less than a half a million away from passing it and there's another holiday coming up and there's DLC coming up so it's not like people can really wait for a different version there's another holiday coming up yeah it's Christmas and people don't buy enough stuff for that even though it's the best part of the season of May I mean I would argue that video game sales are doing really well during this time - yeah I could definitely see it over passing just because of current oh man yeah I mean I think individual I'm just curious like switches aren't cheap and a lot of people aren't making money so I don't know if that number will rise as much as we think it will given the certain current circumstances like it's definitely demand cuz they're sold out yeah and if you were to look at 3d s sales when diamond and pearl obviously there wasn't a hundred and fifty million ds's when diamond Pro came out there was 115 million ds's near the end of that lifecycle but that's three times the amount of hardware out then the switch there's only 55 million switches in people's hands I guess I don't know how many are stuck on a boat or in the back of a Walmart right now probably none because they're not making them as fast the fast enough this this number is like super impressive just in general but this number is gonna get weird once DLC comes out because like Ruby and Sapphire sold 16 million copies and then emerald sold another six and then like Sunnat our Sun and Moon sold 16 million and then ultra Sun and Moon sold 8 million so I don't know if Sauron Shields gonna sell another 6 million copies because of the G LC LC I I would argue that if the DLC is strong that it will yeah because because people will well number one they're adding more pokemon in yep which is gonna get people excited but yeah just people will like if it's really good DLC they're gonna say oh hey this is what I was waiting for and then you know and kind of the steam of being so burned by what they feel as a slight from the Pokemon company will have kind of passed a little bit as well and I feel like it feels a little different with DLC as well you're getting the base game and you can choose whether or not to pay more or extra for the DLC whereas emerald and an ultra Sun and Moon were completely separate game so you had to choose whether or not to get the original or get the third version you will yeah and we we knew that we know there there are there were players that were like oh I'm just gonna wait for the third one yeah absolutely kind of figured that around forever yep no you can't you have to commit if nothing gets delayed the DLC is next month probably at the end of the month but do they put out like a retail version in November assuming that the second set of DLC is in November where it's a cartridge with both DLCs on it for 60 or 70 bucks like maybe a discounted price but maybe just at 60 bucks and you get the DLC on shelves for the holiday yes they absolutely do because I feel like you just don't know like a deluxe edition yeah like a deluxe edition with DLC like this is sword and shield Plus both DLCs on the cartridge in a box on the shelf yes too long didn't read boycott didn't work person she because I didn't tell Japan and it was too late yeah they didn't tell Japan about the boycott Pokemon and go alive let's get this Pokemon good news out of the way two things one there was a snubbull day thing today we're recording this on a Saturday night I don't know if you guys did the snubbull stuff no I already know I was getting asleep alright well as somebody who played this novel day it was pretty good they did uh it was 2020 tasks of three or twenty quests like it was a 20-point quest line each quest had three things or whatever they call it so sixty things all together right twenty times 360 and I think they increased I heard that snubbull was as shiny have the shiny luck as Min Chino which was like one in ten one in fifteen something like that it took me about four hours to complete it and I was pulling pretty slow and played at home all of the tasks were catch three pokemon then it's not you get a stubble catch you know three curveballs get us double take three pictures everybody pokemon get us double so it's pretty easy and yeah I thought was fun I thought it was good the they did refresh you with like pokeballs and great balls and stuff as you as you went so pretty easy to do it from home so that happened they are also doing a incense day for water and dark Pokemon on May 17th from 11:00 to 5:00 local time so they did this before with the what was it was like grass for an hour than fire for an hour than water for an hour so they're doing water pokemon and then dark pokemon water dark water dark for six hours and you can encounter you will see an increase of murkuro Sableye scraggy will finally be in the wild will get that shiny Sableye it's true horsey time poll and a Lola mola will be somewhat item they say they may appear might appear I don't know in the antic might appear may not appear on it says in the press article and it will feature car carvanha so if you're looking for a bright green ugly fish that turns into a purple shark now's your chance may I to talk about my problem sure earlier this week I was kind of I don't remember what I had done but I was like you know what the time has come I can start playing pokemon go at work as like i'll insensate up they've made this game for the homebound now it makes sense you know to play while I'm at work so you know in sense pokeball plus go for it and I was like well you know if I'm doing this at home why don't I just try to do the Kanto challenge I was like okay let me look at that and I was like okay these tasks are gonna take some time but I can do it so I did challenge number one got through it all did challenge number two got through it all started doing challenge number three it was like okay you know and this is actually Friday morning I was like challenge number three good okay I'll get done with this and I can move on to the johto challenge and that's when I noticed that the Kanto challenge had nine stages to it why would you time it delenn it something that has nine stages and make one of them be like I'm not anybody complaining about having to do the raid because I went and bought a raid also sub complaint B I opened the store in Pokemon go and literally this is I am not fibbing in the slightest bit the store opened up it said one coin for a remote raid pass and immediately that disappeared mine did the same thing gone I don't know what happened there you don't get the one coin remote raid I didn't get so what about this too but continues sorry I had a hundred coins I bought a remote that was fine it was the you must catch an electric pokemon I'm like where am I going to find an electric pokemon down here in south Minneapolis we we know we don't have those like I looked I said I have five hours left there's no way I can get through six stages done but what's really awful about that is now I have zero incentive to do any of the other challenges because the whole point is you do all of the challenges and then you get invited to that final you're the Genesis again yeah yeah and it's like well I'm there's no way I'm gonna be getting that so not gonna bother with the rest of it I sent them lying to myself I already paid money for the genesect I just didn't complete that mission either Wednesday of next week I'm gonna look let me do the Giotto challenge and then if you like Friday more day I'm gonna be like wait I have five more stages to complete never gonna get this done alright that's my complaint but the the canto challenges was actually set up pretty cool so if you followed it it actually followed the canto line so for example the first quest was catch a grass water catch three grass water or fire pokemon that's obviously the Pokemon you start with then it's snapshot at bug type Pokemon so that would be like the forest and then it's catching a rock pokémon which would be like mountain moon and then the first reward for doing those three is onyx which is rocks Pokemon and then it's battle in a raid which gets you close re which would also be Mountain and then transfer three Pokemon which is probably like a reference to like meeting bill and then catch a water type Pokemon because you're in cerulean city and then the reward for that is star me which is Missy's Pokemon and then you evolve through Pokemon which I guess would be like the breeder or the daycare and then its hatch an egg well maybe that's the daycare which gets you Snorlax but Snorlax appears to blood blocking your route and then you catch an electric pokemon because you're in Viridian City and then you catch a ride too which is lieutenant surges and then you have to give your buddy a treat which will get you a gastly which would then show lavender Tower and then you would give a gift to a friend which would be the dratini in the game corner which is right before Erica which that if you do all do it those then you get Tangela and then Chauncey shows up which is safari zone and then that leads into you getting a wheezing which is Koga then if you take a picture of a ghost type Pokemon Lapras appears which is sylco and then Hitmonchan which is that fighting dojo and then you do all that and you get Alakazam and then there's a Volvo Pokemon gets you in Aerodactyl which would be the cinnabar and then that Pokemon would be Arcanine which I think Blaine has a Narconon probably in one of the games number nine out of eight was neato King which is Giovanni and then the final one gets you me too so they actually the Kanto quest line told a pretty cool story that probably 9 out of 10 people didn't even notice nor care well didn't notice now I care the johto one does like a slightly similar thing except Joe chose a bad region and all the johto Gym Leaders have bad Pokemon for example Falkner has a Pidgey and a pidgeotto and Marty has Haunter Haunter and Gengar I think the only gym leaders that actually used Johto Pokemon were like Jasmine and that was only one of her Pokemon word Johto which was steelix and then I think Bryce oh Whitney has a metal tank yeah that's true she's a Clefairy though what was that dude the macho dude he uses like a primeape and a Poliwrath even though they introduced like him on top in that region but they didn't give it to him I don't know and they had like 18 birds in that region like Noctowl and hoot-hoot and they gave Faulkner a pidgeotto man that region bums me so they do it is modified I think like the first quest of the johto does get you like Noctowl I think or I ought to or something so it's like slightly modified to be more Johto Pokemon but it kind of tells like a similar story so I would expect the same for Hoenn and Sinnoh when those come around it is weird though yeah I didn't think about that if you missed out on the Kanto now it's almost like you don't have any motivation to do the next ones because you can't get into the genesect now genocide thing now yep note that today infection was that's the section you get to look at now and not participate um poke mango is going to do this is off Pokemon go live as well we were running small tests to revamp the pokey coin a system I don't know if people just like this as much as I like that does the Masters news but there was people with their hot takes on this as well yep there were right now the only way to earn coins is to defend gems but then since the Pokemon goes release we've added features to vastly change the way you play in addition with more trainers playing at home we are looking to provide ways for pokey coins in one place so in the future we will be rewarding you pokey coins for activities besides defending gyms we are doing this test in Australia and will be coming to trainers after the testing phase in order to balance the new method of coins the number of coins earned from defending gems will be reduced from 6 hours to to 6 per hour Oh - pearl yeah I was like 6 hours in two hours no you get 6 per hour before right you want to every 10 minutes now it is one coin every 30 minutes maximum coins you can earn will be 55 instead of 50 here are some of the daily activities you might see complete the featured activities to receive 5 pokey coins make an excellent throw of all the pokemon make a great throw use a berry to help catch a Pokemon take snapshot catch a Pokemon powerup a Pokemon make a nice thorough transfer of Pokemon winter raid during the initial rollout in Australia we will collect feedback and perform additional testing based on the results thank you for the continued support we look forward to providing you an update to all trainers once testing is complete please stay tuned to official channels I'm still confused about this I don't think anyone has a right answer unless there was an update but it says to me it says here are some of the daily activities you might see complete the featured activities each day to receive 5 coins and then they list from making an excellent throw to winning a raid which I don't do those 2 every day well maybe I guess I could maybe care about an X alone throw but that's like selectively a like certain Pokemon are easier than others true and you do get a rate pass every day but that's assuming that you want to leave your house to do a raid so are they saying I have to do two four six eight nine things to get five coins or am I getting one coin per each thing there's nine things but I don't have to do five of them like this is really unclear of what they're asking us to do they're also not saying that that's a complete list and they start off saying here are some of the daily activities but then they say complete the featured activities each day to receive five coins so I have a feeling it's gonna be like a section on the today tab where random things are gonna pull up and if you do like the three random things you get the five point you get the five coins it's one you get one coin maybe per task and then there's like like if you complete all of them then they suck a bonus type thanks if I recall correctly I think Wizards United doesn't do this um Harry Potter is insider info I also I haven't played that longer much longer than I haven't played for the best honestly if I recall correctly I mean what my take would be is because this is combined with them reducing the number of coins you get from defending a gym is that you would just get five coins for each of the activities no no no it was you get complete the featured activities to receive five coins yeah so that I don't think each activity is worth five coins I mean that's your opinion I have it you think caching your Pokemon they're gonna give you five pennies heck no the first time you catch a Pokemon a day yeah yeah they give you five coins you ain't gonna buy much with five coins friend area ster if you got that 7-day streak they get the five days I think ago anyway I think no to meet the second sentence says complete the featured activities with an S each day to receive five coins so I think that there's gonna be a list of like three things you do all three you get five coins that's it that's all you get I mean that's sad it's almost not even worth getting out of bed hey take a snapshot catch a Pokemon have a nice throw you're gonna be doing that anyways yeah so I don't see take no snapshots I mean the thing is is like right now the coin system to earn coins is very dependent if you can find a gym particularly good if you if that gym is in a remote location that doesn't see a lot of people or in the case of downtown Minneapolis if you can manage to stay downtown at five when everybody leaves and then find one open and dump one in it will last all night but like the gym thing to earn coins was very limiting very luck based and really like I mean it's pretty easy to get 50 coins if you live in a city and you have like I mean this is the unfairness of Pokemon go but if in a perfect world meet Greg Britney and will lived in the same area and we were all on the same team and we played Pokemon go in the evenings together as friends do it would be very easy for us to take any number of gyms we walk by and they would probably be very safe overnight and we would all get 50 coins every day in an ideal world yeah but you are wrong I don't know if ideal is the word for it we're people walking past the gym knocking it out is very quick and off-putting for Pokemon in is totally different than one person spending anywhere between you know five to 15 minutes to knock out the gym so low and then put one pokemon in and then somebody else driving by or walking by being like oh there's only one pokemon here I'm gonna take this because we're we are all that people we were all those people that will walk by a gym with six pokemon in and go nope no not interested but if all six poke might have one agency true you better believe you'd be like I'm taking this but the problem is you're putting one in and they're you're not putting like two in or three or four in which then somebody else is gonna be like only one easy to do I think it's cool that they give that giving you another way to earn coins I think that I've the chimp system I think is fine I'm sick of hearing people being like it needs to be a hundred coins like it used to be no the old gym system was so incredibly garbage and broken you had to go through like nine layers of Pokemon just to get to the end to even put a Pokemon in and then it would get knocked out right away like the amount of people claiming that they were earning a hundred coins a day they were like the zero zero zero one percent and the amount of time you had to invest for one dollar was ridiculous now if there's six Pokemon in a gym and they're fully powered up that's not worth my even if I was with a friend I don't think that's worth fifteen minutes for 50 cents and if you were like oh well it'sit's gonna be worth a dollar I don't know I can make I could make a dollar in 15 minutes it's Danny about the money it's about the pride of achievement now that they're changing this from six-six per hour to to per hour uh what's the math on that how many hours is that to be in a gym to get max ten hours right no eight hours 36 times 5 42 48 Hey oh yeah close that it has to be in a gym for 8 hours and now it has to be in a gym for yeah 25 hours so yeah then then I'd be waking up to like 26 cents instead of 50 cents I don't know anything that requires me to leave my house if I'm not already planning to leave that wrong no I prefer masters in this case to the ground over cook might go I'm assuming via daily activities you only get as five so if you're doing it every day that's 35 coins a week by doing the whatever the future activities is yeah if you're maxing out at five a day that's 35 coins a week and if you're maxing out gyms every day that's 350 coins a week and if your mac saying gyms and coins a day you're up to 385 coins a week and we you're stopped at the 55 right each day no matter what you do compassion right yeah now that I'm thinking about it I feel like 6 2 2 is not great maybe like 6 to 4 or 6 to 3 I'd feel better about but saying a pokemon has to be in a gym for 25 hours to max it out or take three gyms at night to like equal the one gym cuz I you max out at eight hours but I guess it's pretty I mean it's pretty easy to like put one pokemon in a gym for eight hours especially like where Milwaukee parks closed at 9:00 so the 200 IQ easy 200 IQ is you get to the park at 8:55 you knock out the one Pokemon with 1 HP you put your Pokemon in the gym locks from 9 to 6 and then you're golden because Milwaukee has that is what you're doing but most most Pokemon I've left in gyms usually stay in the gyms until the morning no that makes very and now you're experience I haven't found a good one before you got something you checked here at some hardcore people rated at 3 a.m. in downtown Minneapolis you bet yeah well used to now nobody goes down there so I almost went down there on Friday get up almost seems almost you didn't alright Greg give us her question well that's all the news we got is it Greg give us a question of the week here alright ready if you have something you wanted to ask get it to us that's your only task if our interest you happen to be it'll become question of the week I need some more to pick that up I recognize the tune I just can't the name it's not coming to me yep this is from Chris with so many characters why it doesn't Pokemon crossing exist come on Nintendo I wanna fall I feel like crap pulling up potus's fishing for bass : wait which Chris asks this one Chris G Chris G that sounds about right yeah Pat dude his organ harvesting I said this on Twitter because I'm buddy posted animal every time an animal crossing comes out somebody does fanart for it yeah and the Pokemon Panther grandma cross my heart I'd be like yeah I would play that game forever but I would could only have 10 which is even harder than picking your team of six you have 10 people I'm gonna be like do they evolved is each line its own like is there a buddy villager or Roselia villager and then a rose raid villager or is it just the final level like now I feel like maybe some limit where they like we're only including to it like what they do in Animal Crossing to exit I see well they do that a mystery dungeon you can't get all the pokemon mystery dungeon yeah but they can't evolve I'm just saying do they have set or the eyes there Oh as your friendship grows does your does your villagers of all your villager suddenly evolving into some peace they want counters change all the time anyways yeah but no one wants a Wailord villager anyway the camp in the house they had a weird what happened did you have Wailord and skiddy in your town do they take in the count the egg groups can you hatch villagers hatching no no no then they would have to introduce a day me I don't all honestly I was thinking about this and I don't think that like I don't think that even if there was a crossover like even if it was like Pokemon or did you Mon or like Mario characters I just think that at a certain point no matter what like if it's your favorite series and it's animal crossing and you don't like animal crossing you're not gonna get it like at a certain point it's just that game is not you can put monster hundred one of my favorite series into drag Algy a loss I still don't want to play for yogi lajas like I just don't and that event was really good and the fights were really fun and they married what happened in animal and in mouse or hunt and so it's like it was really well done it's like new but Nagas ambition I was like mmhmm yeah there was many Pokemon as you want in they're not gonna touch it and now my main character can transform into Rathalos so it's that sounds awesome that actually sounds real cool well like because I've been playing so much Pokemon and so much Animal Crossing on Twitch there's just like there there's a certain set of people that are watching me just because they like to watch me but they're like man I just animal Crossing's not for me and it's like what if they were Pokemon they're like I just don't want to pick weeds and like sell turnips and it's like I get it I get it sometimes I don't want to pick weeds and sultriness either but here we are I mean you don't have to pick the weeds it's yeah it's true you can just have a messy island you just pay somebody else to pick the weeds like real life okay well Pokemon of the week well last week's Pokemon was a crossword puzzle and boy I'm kind of concerned at you guys was it six down six Hardbody connected by the digestive system and you look through all of the Bubba pedia entry no there's got know there are people who got the Pokemon of the week and still couldn't get six down I mean I gave you my answer and you said it was wrong because it was wrong in any of the boxes in chat correct no chats at all what were the answers like a recording studio is soundproof what you achieve when you win victory the electric Mouse Pokemon Pikachu like a hummingbird SAP zipper I type that isn't strange normal fifth generation region you Nova the number four your perfect person ten the path you take paved or not route route ten hmm to ram headfirst God what was that one no I didn't even think of enough to talk it's like you know oh that's bouffalant signature move it is paved for transportation road the PG by Death exactly - two down on the downs one who seeks clues detective because this Pokemon was featured and detective Pikachu for this week's Pokemon it was who was it Greg correct the brief two parts of the body connected by the digestive system yes you could say mouth and other things but if you were to look through the vulva pedia page four bouffalant you might say hmm where is the mouth located it's located in the head and then you'd say oh yes bouffalant knows the move head but okay I said head but yes you did that's what I said that's when I said it's not six down actually hunted a plant one time sure acting without fear is reckless what a battery holds charge hairstyle popular in the 60s and 70s I don't know why even took Greg any amount of time to get back hair style is timeless but it is timeless you are correct but it was mostly popular in the 60s and 70s good day this very day a lot of proud people that is true there's what I think 60s 70s I think be hype that's 50s no it's not the top of a match is head I think wasn't it 16 down head yes anyways bouffalant that was the Pokemon of the week there's like no trivia for bouffalant so I'm not even gonna strange it's based on a buffalo roof it was made you know the horoscope yeah but in the you know of a horoscope it is the Pokemon for May how it has that shuffle like on there Greg knack not too bad I mean it's you know give me a bit of side-eye it's got a little porygon I which I'm not thrilled about but otherwise is pretty good porygon aye yes really it's really

so many difficulties with my beautifully made easy easy crossword you get this week's Pokemon of the week buckle it buckle buckle in buckle up buckle buckle it's gonna be a bumpy ride yeah it is here we go they fit up and it's I I will give you an additional clue before I start reading what I wrote this is Steve's fault Jetta it's chatot nope the careful listener will know that it's not chat hot only some of this is relevant to this week's Pokemon this film received a 39% on the rotten tomatoes tomato meter with the Critics consensus stating that its pulpy pleasures are constricted by its own absurdity but creature feature fans may enjoy its brazen silliness with the description a documentary film crew journeys to the depths of the Amazon in search of the mysterious shirishama Indians and ends up fighting a gargantuan insatiable snake that squeezes its prey to death eats it whole regurgitates it and then eats it again IMDB describes the 1997 film with a National Geographic film crew is taken hostage by an insane hunter who forces them along in his quest to capture the world's largest and deadliest snake finally Wikipedia claims it is a 1997 American adventure horror film directed by Lewis Yosa and starring Jennifer Lopez Ice Cube Jon Voight Eric Stoltz Jonathan Hyde and Owen Wilson faces why did these people say yes oh they needed a paycheck yeah it focuses on a documentary film crew in the Amazon rainforest that is captured by a snake hunter who is hunting down a giant legendary green snake the film received mixed reviews but was a box-office success it grossed a hundred and thirty six point eight million worldwide against a budget of forty five million and also achieved the status of a cult classic it was followed by a series of films the sequels for this film include titles such as the hunt for the blood orchid offspring trail of blood lake placid verse this movie no the main thing to consider here is and this is the important point folks what if this movie took place in a desert instead of the Amazon there you go the cats just get worse and worse no clearly a bottom-feeder that is the greatest one-line review for this all right that's that's our episode
