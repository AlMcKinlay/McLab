you for not telling me about the Pokemon (1:08 - 1:14)
zoom backgrounds oh my word it's not (1:10 - 1:18)
important to my life I'm no way assuming (1:14 - 1:20)
you have a lot of Pokemon a lot of zoom (1:18 - 1:25)
calls look I run at least two RPGs on (1:20 - 1:28)
two different days that you zoom and I (1:25 - 1:30)
play jack box games sometimes through (1:28 - 1:32)
zoom so don't start with me I actually (1:30 - 1:35)
bought the thing to have a monthly zoom (1:32 - 1:39)
meeting so I could run games so there (1:35 - 1:42)

what we're calling people who you zoom (1:42 - 1:48)

that's not an expression but sure (2:20 - 2:24)
definitely not holding you hostage (2:26 - 2:34)
but if I were people listening it's a (2:29 - 2:37)
million dollars to get Steve back just (2:34 - 2:39)
no one's paying that much for me (2:37 - 2:42)

breaking point number two is rad boot (3:53 - 3:59)
drizzle thwack II sir fetch gallery' and (3:56 - 4:03)
Ponyta cram rant and Polti guys plushies (3:59 - 4:05)
have been added to the Pokemon Center (4:03 - 4:09)
that crammed rant so good I actually (4:05 - 4:12)
have not been impressed by the new (4:09 - 4:14)
Galera and stuffed animals especially (4:12 - 4:18)
the obstacle I think that thing looks (4:14 - 4:20)
terrible if you give that to your child (4:18 - 4:22)
it's basically telling your child that (4:20 - 4:24)
you don't like them and you're very (4:22 - 4:27)
disappointed in them ya know (4:24 - 4:31)
the poltergeist the fact that the cracks (4:27 - 4:35)
and holes aren't real like it's not it's (4:31 - 4:37)
just painted on the outside so it's (4:35 - 4:39)
still a perfect sphere (4:37 - 4:42)
I'm having difficulties the cracks a (4:39 - 4:44)
really low effort on this Polti guys (4:42 - 4:47)
they're just black lines I mean but they (4:44 - 4:51)
did put in a ton of work for Kramer and (4:47 - 4:54)
I don't think that one has looked better (4:51 - 4:58)
it's got a great smile yeah look you (4:54 - 5:00)
know I know you're being malicious here (4:58 - 5:04)
the the sir fetch they did put in the (5:00 - 5:06)
work they did put in the work for sure (5:04 - 5:08)
Fred sure fresh they put in the work the (5:06 - 5:11)
shield is like great it's like they (5:08 - 5:13)
didn't cop out like the Polti guys thing (5:11 - 5:16)
the leak they got the onion popped like (5:13 - 5:18)
everything about it the the eyes they (5:16 - 5:21)
somebody was their budget was like (5:18 - 5:24)
here's a thousand dollars to design (5:21 - 5:27)
these plushies and the first the the (5:24 - 5:28)
first thing they designed was sir fetch (5:27 - 5:30)
and then they were like oh we only have (5:28 - 5:33)
fifty bucks left for our budget so I'm (5:30 - 5:34)
gonna use this and stretch it across (5:33 - 5:38)
Kramer ant mmm Polti guys over here hmm (5:34 - 5:40)
you really got the short end of the (5:38 - 5:43)
stick that's not too bad I like the (5:40 - 5:45)
point I won if anyone's pretty good I (5:43 - 5:48)
like it the first time I saw it and it (5:45 - 5:51)
was called My Little Pony it still (5:48 - 5:57)
called okay okay you have to put by both (5:51 - 6:01)
more peco's don't you cuz it doesn't (5:57 - 6:03)
change it's not like they did a cool (6:01 - 6:04)
thing you make it inside out they (6:03 - 6:07)
received a Aiden inside out more more (6:04 - 6:09)
Petco more Pico I still don't how to say (6:07 - 6:11)
this thing I thought they made it inside (6:09 - 6:13)
one out in Japan they also made a Kramer (6:11 - 6:16)
aunt with a fish in its mouth in Japan (6:13 - 6:19)
but they didn't bring that over I too (6:16 - 6:21)
offensive for the American market also (6:19 - 6:23)
because of Japan's really mad that we (6:21 - 6:25)
didn't tell them about the national dex (6:23 - 6:27)
so we think it's uh for a while (6:25 - 6:29)
they're holding out the good pushes on (6:27 - 6:33)
us well and also Japanese people don't (6:29 - 6:35)
realize that people eat sushi over here (6:33 - 6:37)
so the whole concept of raw fish they're (6:35 - 6:38)
like well we can't let the Americans see (6:37 - 6:40)
raw fish they'll think that there's (6:38 - 6:42)
something culturally wrong with that I (6:40 - 6:45)
mean there is but would you stop I had a (6:42 - 6:48)
delicious sushi for lunch my sushi (6:45 - 6:50)
delivery right now but it's all (6:48 - 6:53)
vegetables (6:50 - 6:54)
I feel like you're not doing it right (6:53 - 7:00)
then why is sushi sushi there's no raw (6:54 - 7:03)
fish yes I mean I get written in Japan (7:00 - 7:06)
there is vegetarian sushi so I stand (7:03 - 7:16)
corrected all right full disclosure I am (7:06 - 7:19)
partnered with DNA no we're gonna talk (7:16 - 7:21)
about this are we I'm not excited to (7:19 - 7:23)
talk about this full disclosure I'm not (7:21 - 7:27)
excited to talk about this this is (7:23 - 7:31)
Pokemon masters - game calm which yes is (7:27 - 7:33)

Vanguard zero but I can co-write with my (7:41 - 7:46)
vanguard zero experiences okay alright (7:43 - 7:47)
Greg still playing masters that I'll (7:46 - 7:49)

you playing masters at all no it's it's (7:49 - 7:53)
can't keep up with it (7:51 - 7:55)

here we go (7:55 - 8:01)
message get ready to play even less (7:56 - 8:01)
because yeah I guess you're not (8:01 - 8:06)
technically wrong that's what they're (8:04 - 8:10)
doing volume 10 greetings trainers we (8:06 - 8:13)
are the producers of Pokemon masters us (8:10 - 8:17)
a sec sake I think as I say it and to (8:13 - 8:21)
tsuya Iguchi here with a new message for (8:17 - 8:23)
you this time we are excited to share (8:21 - 8:25)
the details about the legendary arena (8:23 - 8:28)
and new feature and future updates new (8:25 - 8:31)
updates to tactics and team optimization (8:28 - 8:33)
have you been making use of the new (8:31 - 8:35)
tactic feature we introduced in April's (8:33 - 8:39)
update no okay I didn't look at it and I (8:35 - 8:41)
don't really know how to use it with the (8:39 - 8:43)
tactics you can control the order in (8:41 - 8:45)
which the opponent's target your members (8:43 - 8:47)
all we know I did do this I did do this (8:45 - 8:49)
I actually needed to do it for the (8:47 - 8:51)
silver thing them targeting Milotic (8:49 - 8:54)
first was actually very helpful by using (8:51 - 8:56)
this feature to protect your vulnerable (8:54 - 8:58)
sync pairs you can now battle with an (8:56 - 9:01)
extra layer of strategy we hope you find (8:58 - 9:02)
that this feature useful in the upcoming (9:01 - 9:04)
battle villa and the upcoming legendary (9:02 - 9:07)
arena we've also updated the (9:04 - 9:09)
team optimization setting to be even (9:07 - 9:11)
better at assembling the best sync pair (9:09 - 9:13)
of lineups for you use it along with the (9:11 - 9:16)
tactics to create a strategical sound (9:13 - 9:19)
team all at once I will say that feature (9:16 - 9:20)
was very good I didn't know that was a (9:19 - 9:22)
new feature though how do you do it I (9:20 - 9:24)
haven't liked probably that at all I (9:22 - 9:28)
think when you go into your team this is (9:24 - 9:31)
a good question cuz I did it when uh is (9:28 - 9:33)
it the tactics button you just click on (9:31 - 9:34)
yeah you just click on the tactics (9:33 - 9:37)
button under edit team oh oh okay and (9:34 - 9:39)
then you can pick who is getting hit (9:37 - 9:41)
first and who's getting paid hit last I (9:39 - 9:42)
mean when I was playing I probably would (9:41 - 9:44)
have liked that feature a lot of fun (9:42 - 9:48)
yeah well when there's like certain (9:44 - 9:50)
Pokemon and masters that like need to (9:48 - 9:51)
set up stuff and then they're just dead (9:50 - 9:54)
weight mm-hmm yep and you're like you (9:51 - 9:58)
can you're done you did you did what you (9:54 - 10:01)
needed to do the legendary arena battle (9:58 - 10:03)
parameters are completely new to Pokemon (10:01 - 10:05)
masters the legendary arena opens (10:03 - 10:07)
mid-june and the first battle will be (10:05 - 10:09)
against Entei the battle Villa and the (10:07 - 10:11)
legendary arena are similar in that you (10:09 - 10:14)
have a you have to use a multiple number (10:11 - 10:16)
multiple teams to battle but in (10:14 - 10:18)
legendary arena the number of sync pairs (10:16 - 10:21)
that can join battles in a single day is (10:18 - 10:24)
greater your opponent in the legendary (10:21 - 10:27)
arena will boasts a lot of HP and the HP (10:24 - 10:29)
decreases its attack patterns and status (10:27 - 10:32)
conditions resistances will change which (10:29 - 10:33)
means that different sync pairs will (10:32 - 10:35)
excel at different parts of the battle (10:33 - 10:38)
for the first legendary arena we (10:35 - 10:40)
recommend you pairing your water-type (10:38 - 10:43)
sync pairs okay so those that's out of (10:40 - 10:46)
the way now the tactic thing made it (10:43 - 10:46)
better (10:46 - 10:48)
legendary now coming mid-june Entei (10:46 - 10:50)
power up your water pokemon you probably (10:48 - 10:52)
already did this if you're doing the (10:50 - 10:56)
whole event right now this is what the (10:52 - 10:59)
community doesn't seem happy about oh (10:56 - 11:03)
yeah before we go through this there is (10:59 - 11:05)
a feedback form you can provide them (11:03 - 11:08)
feedback they are listening if you want (11:05 - 11:16)
to send a Gucci and Sasaki Sasaki Sasaki (11:08 - 11:20)
be Blackey because the Japanese (11:16 - 11:22)
team makes these decisions I only work (11:20 - 11:24)
with the English team and they are (11:22 - 11:26)
asking me for feedback as well on this I (11:24 - 11:28)
feel you guys alright here we go (11:26 - 11:32)
plans to improve existing features we (11:28 - 11:34)
have received feedback regarding the (11:32 - 11:36)
amount of time required to train sync (11:34 - 11:39)
pairs since training requires multiple (11:36 - 11:40)
items and only so many items can be (11:39 - 11:42)
obtained from a single battle trainers (11:40 - 11:44)
must complete the same battles several (11:42 - 11:50)
times they heard you Greg in order to (11:44 - 11:52)
streamline the process and provide (11:50 - 11:55)
better balance of time spent to rewards (11:52 - 11:59)
earned we are revisiting the system this (11:55 - 12:00)
all sounds good so far (11:59 - 12:03)
reduce time spent battling for items (12:00 - 12:06)
sounds great reorganize battles that (12:03 - 12:08)
reward items sounds good (12:06 - 12:11)
yeah set a maximum number of playable (12:08 - 12:18)
battles per day no no no why why are you (12:11 - 12:21)
doing this here's a breakdown of what (12:18 - 12:23)
each improvement entails reduce time (12:21 - 12:25)
spent battling for items we are (12:23 - 12:27)
implementing adjustments to sync pairs (12:25 - 12:29)
that join your team this includes having (12:27 - 12:31)
them start with unlocked level caps for (12:29 - 12:33)
certain levels and access to all of (12:31 - 12:36)
their moves and their passive skills we (12:33 - 12:37)
are introducing an item that will allow (12:36 - 12:39)
you to skip battles while getting (12:37 - 12:43)
rewards currently sync pairs needed to (12:39 - 12:44)
be trained for a certain degree for (12:43 - 12:46)
trainers to fully enjoy challenging (12:44 - 12:48)
battles this item these items require (12:46 - 12:51)
the items required to do so can take (12:48 - 12:53)
time to obtain our goal is to streamline (12:51 - 12:55)
the training process so everyone can (12:53 - 12:57)
focus on enjoying exciting battles (12:55 - 13:00)
ultimately we want to reduce the need to (12:57 - 13:03)
auto battle to obtain items reorganizing (13:00 - 13:05)
battles that reward items we are (13:03 - 13:07)
considering reorganizing battles too (13:05 - 13:10)
according of what items they award items (13:07 - 13:12)
for level-cap items for leveling up (13:10 - 13:15)
evolution items and sync orbs and so on (13:12 - 13:17)
setting a maximum number of playable (13:15 - 13:20)
battles a day we are setting a limit on (13:17 - 13:23)
the maximum number of battles that can (13:20 - 13:25)
be played in one day this limit wouldn't (13:23 - 13:27)
apply to all battles only two battles (13:25 - 13:29)
obtaining items to strengthen sync pairs (13:27 - 13:31)
via the battle Villa or other battles (13:29 - 13:33)
with matching such as co-op would not be (13:31 - 13:33)
if (13:33 - 13:36)
affected to balance things out we will (13:33 - 13:38)
drastically increase the number of items (13:36 - 13:40)
can that become acquire in one battle (13:38 - 13:43)
under this new system you'll be able to (13:40 - 13:45)
decide which battles to prioritize with (13:43 - 13:46)
these adjustments we hope to make the (13:45 - 13:48)
training experience much more efficient (13:46 - 13:51)
we are always working hard to deliver (13:48 - 13:53)
updates and improvements that make the (13:51 - 13:55)
world of Pokemon masters as fun as (13:53 - 13:57)
possible we prioritize trainers feedback (13:55 - 13:59)
throughout the development process so (13:57 - 14:00)
don't hesitate to let us know what you (13:59 - 14:05)
think ok that's what we got so far so I (14:00 - 14:07)
didn't hear the word stamina once but (14:05 - 14:09)
you guys said there was a whole stamina (14:07 - 14:12)
thing yeah I guess we don't know fully (14:09 - 14:15)
what right may be the maximum number of (14:12 - 14:20)
battles is like in essence the maximum (14:15 - 14:23)
number of battles per day is what a (14:20 - 14:27)
stamina system is in other games ah (14:23 - 14:31)
so for moat like the my main went rogue (14:27 - 14:33)
all you lost you have a hundred and (14:31 - 14:37)
fifty stamina a day you know top tier (14:33 - 14:40)
battles take ten of those stamina so you (14:37 - 14:43)
can only do 15 battles a day that came (14:40 - 14:45)
however lets you build up so if there's (14:43 - 14:46)
some evidence you want to go to you can (14:45 - 14:48)
build up your stamina and keep it to (14:46 - 14:50)
focus on something that you do want to (14:48 - 14:54)
do which I do hope they do here I was (14:50 - 14:55)
very excited when they say they're (14:54 - 14:57)
introducing an item that allow you to (14:55 - 14:59)
skip battles while getting their rewards (14:57 - 15:00)
and that's what I want that's what (14:59 - 15:04)
everybody wants the biggest problem with (15:00 - 15:07)
this is for like okay I have a sync pair (15:04 - 15:08)
that I'm trying to do the whole event (15:07 - 15:14)
I've got a sync pair I need 750 of a (15:08 - 15:17)
particular bottle and under the current (15:14 - 15:22)
system one battle will give me 20 so (15:17 - 15:25)
I've got like 38 of those battles that I (15:22 - 15:29)
have to do to unlock this next level so (15:25 - 15:31)
that I can get through this whole event (15:29 - 15:35)
which is limited to try like there's is (15:31 - 15:37)
this huge time sink so unless they are (15:35 - 15:41)
going to really ramp up the rewards I (15:37 - 15:43)
mean and they have to make it pretty (15:41 - 15:46)
drastic it's the same problem except the (15:43 - 15:47)
game (15:46 - 15:51)
you off yeah like if they triple it but (15:47 - 15:53)
only give you ten I'm still not able to (15:51 - 15:56)
get what I need to level up I'm you're (15:53 - 15:57)
just telling me to stop plate (15:56 - 16:00)
okay stop playing the game because (15:57 - 16:01)
you're you're done it's almost like a (16:00 - 16:03)
contradiction here like they're they're (16:01 - 16:05)
admitting like yes we know that there's (16:03 - 16:07)
there's so many items that you need to (16:05 - 16:09)
level up these these Pokemon and these (16:07 - 16:12)
these trainers but we're we know this (16:09 - 16:16)
and we're gonna set a cap like it's good (16:12 - 16:20)
that they're increasing the maximum (16:16 - 16:21)
amount that you can get with each battle (16:20 - 16:24)
but I don't see how putting a cap is (16:21 - 16:26)
fixing the problem oh yeah skipping (16:24 - 16:29)
battles yes that's that's helping the (16:26 - 16:31)
process putting caps on it no especially (16:29 - 16:34)
if you're not keeping up with it every (16:31 - 16:37)
single day yeah the only the only (16:34 - 16:41)
glimmer of hope I have is that the (16:37 - 16:44)
reward increase is so huge that they (16:41 - 16:47)
feel the need to level up how fast (16:44 - 16:51)
people can get to the top by putting a (16:47 - 16:54)
stamina like cap on it this is entirely (16:51 - 16:57)
dependent on something they have never (16:54 - 16:59)
shown in the past which is giving out a (16:57 - 17:04)
lot of rewards in okay obviously I've (16:59 - 17:08)
switched over to Vanguard zero um and in (17:04 - 17:10)
Vanguard zero they actually do use the (17:08 - 17:16)
word stamina and you you level up as you (17:10 - 17:17)
play the more you play your grade (17:16 - 17:21)
increases right so I'm very low grade (17:17 - 17:24)
right now but as your grade increases (17:21 - 17:27)
your stamina your maximum stamina (17:24 - 17:31)
increases and you use your stamina to (17:27 - 17:37)
play matches but the actual like thing (17:31 - 17:39)
that you pay cash money for in Vanguard (17:37 - 17:43)
zero is the thing that lets you refill (17:39 - 17:45)
your stamina so that you can do more (17:43 - 17:47)
matches and get rewards so it's not (17:45 - 17:49)
really like a limit on the number of (17:47 - 17:52)
games you can play per day because you (17:49 - 17:55)
can pay cash money to refill your (17:52 - 17:57)
stamina and play more games (17:55 - 17:59)
so is that diff (17:57 - 18:02)
print from what's happening here so (17:59 - 18:05)
right now money can only be spent to (18:02 - 18:08)
pole sink pairs and to sometimes get (18:05 - 18:11)
some items since there's no main (18:08 - 18:14)
character there's no levels like you do (18:11 - 18:15)
have a player character but you could (18:14 - 18:17)
ignore your player character for all the (18:15 - 18:19)
other sync pairs so there's nothing like (18:17 - 18:23)
oh I've got a level 5 player character (18:19 - 18:25)
so if I need to get more stamina do I (18:23 - 18:26)
need to get my player character in (18:25 - 18:28)
Pikachu up to a hundred to max out my (18:26 - 18:31)
stamina but I have all these others out (18:28 - 18:34)
of hundreds so like there that that (18:31 - 18:36)
that's sort of how other games do it is (18:34 - 18:41)
a weird fit here mm-hmm adding in pay (18:36 - 18:44)
money to play more I mean we don't know (18:41 - 18:46)
we don't know if that's the thing right (18:44 - 18:47)
we don't know that that's the thing but (18:46 - 18:48)
if they do that I mean they're already (18:47 - 18:50)
ripoff artists with the amount that you (18:48 - 18:54)
have to pay for gems like adding that in (18:50 - 18:59)
is I mean there's very few ways this can (18:54 - 19:02)
be implemented that I that actually (18:59 - 19:04)
helps the game it doesn't hurt it yeah I (19:02 - 19:07)
mean we could be overreacting and it (19:04 - 19:12)
could be okay I mean we've I know Greg (19:07 - 19:15)
has complained about the amount of times (19:12 - 19:16)
we just have to like sit here and do (19:15 - 19:19)
auto battle and I think maybe people who (19:16 - 19:21)
really want silver and ho-oh or maybe (19:19 - 19:24)
experiencing that right now and we (19:21 - 19:25)
haven't really talked about the silver (19:24 - 19:28)
in whole event but they do this thing (19:25 - 19:31)
where every like four hours you get (19:28 - 19:34)
three bonus like three bonuses applied (19:31 - 19:36)
to the auto battle so it's actually kind (19:34 - 19:39)
of nice because it's just like lets me (19:36 - 19:41)
know when I can come back which is (19:39 - 19:42)
almost kind of like them testing this (19:41 - 19:44)
out maybe or maybe this was like a (19:42 - 19:46)
precursor to that because I mean if I (19:44 - 19:49)
get four coins or whatever when I (19:46 - 19:51)
complete a battle normally or if I just (19:49 - 19:53)
wait the four hours I can get so I can (19:51 - 19:57)
get twelve or if I do it when it's like (19:53 - 19:59)
the bonus time I can get thirty and then (19:57 - 20:01)
it's just like okay well I'm done I'll (19:59 - 20:03)
get my 30 I'll come back in like four or (20:01 - 20:04)
five hours I don't get another 30 and (20:03 - 20:07)
it's been a nice way for me to do the (20:04 - 20:08)
whole event and I was able to get hoo (20:07 - 20:11)
today just by doing that twice a day for (20:08 - 20:13)
a week I would wake up (20:11 - 20:17)
do my 3 auto battle bonus coins and then (20:13 - 20:18)
right before I went to bed I could have (20:17 - 20:19)
been doing it more I just forgot and (20:18 - 20:21)
right before I went to bed I did my (20:19 - 20:22)
three auto battle thing it was nice to (20:21 - 20:25)
interact with Pokemon masters that way (20:22 - 20:28)
and I did really bad polls in the loot (20:25 - 20:30)
box one and then Liu box - I got really (20:28 - 20:32)
bad polls and I got lucky for number (20:30 - 20:34)
three I got the hoo ticket thing right (20:32 - 20:35)
away and the number four I got the ho (20:34 - 20:37)
ticket thing like right away and I was (20:35 - 20:40)
able to get ho-oh just by doing one set (20:37 - 20:42)
of threes in the morning and one set of (20:40 - 20:44)
threes at night and I thought that was a (20:42 - 20:48)
really great experience but if maybe you (20:44 - 20:49)
weren't super lucky or maybe you would (20:48 - 20:52)
just wanted to get hoo on day one I can (20:49 - 20:54)
see it being very bad like no one wants (20:52 - 20:56)
to do the same battle all day every day (20:54 - 20:59)
for the luck of getting hoo but I (20:56 - 21:02)
thought this event was good but it also (20:59 - 21:04)
kind of seems like this event was a test (21:02 - 21:07)
period for what they're about to do well (21:04 - 21:09)
so this this this event was the (21:07 - 21:13)
improvement event so in previous events (21:09 - 21:16)
like this you would only get the bonus (21:13 - 21:20)
once on each level and then you wouldn't (21:16 - 21:24)
get the bonus again for 24 hours so you (21:20 - 21:25)
for like the Mewtwo event you'd have to (21:24 - 21:28)
do level 1 level 2 level 3 level 4 you'd (21:25 - 21:31)
get the bonus for each of those and then (21:28 - 21:34)
it was done for 24 hours so with the new (21:31 - 21:38)
system I can do 3 on very hard or (21:34 - 21:41)
whichever the second from the top is I (21:38 - 21:43)
can do that 3 times and max that out (21:41 - 21:46)
then try to do my pulls I'm not thrilled (21:43 - 21:47)
with the pull system like the (21:46 - 21:51)
randomizing of are you lucky are you not (21:47 - 21:54)
because I've been pretty unlucky on all (21:51 - 21:57)
of them it's been in 3 or 4 bolts to get (21:54 - 21:58)
the ticket on each one and still don't (21:57 - 22:00)
have it for the third I think the items (21:58 - 22:01)
like giving you in the prize box are (22:00 - 22:04)
pretty oh I mean like eventually you (22:01 - 22:07)
can't pull like bad items anymore right (22:04 - 22:09)
I mean so the I like the items are (22:07 - 22:11)
better is still a little bit random the (22:09 - 22:14)
fact that it's on a 4 hour the (22:11 - 22:15)
improvements are it's on a 4 hour time (22:14 - 22:18)
and you can pick the level on which they (22:15 - 22:21)
all happen instead of having to do all (22:18 - 22:23)
them again like those are huge (22:21 - 22:25)
improvements yeah like the whole event (22:23 - 22:26)
is more (22:25 - 22:31)
is more fun it is still very grindy (22:26 - 22:32)
because it really depends on your luck (22:31 - 22:33)
on the polls (22:32 - 22:35)
I think the polls at least for me where (22:33 - 22:36)
have been exciting because I like (22:35 - 22:38)
opening stuff so it's like how did I get (22:36 - 22:39)
the ticket (22:38 - 22:43)
no I didn't yeah I mean so that has been (22:39 - 22:45)
a huge improvement what's worrying about (22:43 - 22:49)
this is putting it cap on that so let's (22:45 - 22:52)
say the one that you're doing takes ten (22:49 - 22:54)
stamina and you have a hundred stamina (22:52 - 22:56)
you're not you know I'll do it three (22:54 - 22:58)
times I'll do it three times I'll do it (22:56 - 23:01)
three times into that then I'm out it's (22:58 - 23:02)
weird to have made this improvement that (23:01 - 23:05)
gets you to play the game more and then (23:02 - 23:07)
be implementing a system that will say (23:05 - 23:10)
but only so much I lost you spend money (23:07 - 23:11)
which is again they haven't said that (23:10 - 23:15)
that's most they haven't so this stance (23:11 - 23:18)
anemometer is like here's money up to (23:15 - 23:22)
get past that did refill that but I feel (23:18 - 23:23)
like the whole event conditions you to (23:22 - 23:26)
say like and games need to sometimes do (23:23 - 23:29)
this of like hey you can grind this if (23:26 - 23:31)
you want but come back in like four (23:29 - 23:35)
hours I think I did that for most people (23:31 - 23:39)
anyways is such a philosophical problem (23:35 - 23:41)
with the concept of auto battle it's (23:39 - 23:44)
like I came here to play a game I like (23:41 - 23:48)
not about a lot - yeah but you're it's (23:44 - 23:51)
it's like it's you've been brainwashed (23:48 - 23:54)
into thinking (23:51 - 23:54)
in the previous game though having to (24:02 - 24:10)
play a level that you are 50 times more (24:05 - 24:14)
powerful than isn't fun it is just (24:10 - 24:16)
eating up my time at that point yep (24:14 - 24:19)
I don't know but but that's like that's (24:16 - 24:22)
that's the combination floor of we have (24:19 - 24:26)
we we now are living in an era of games (24:22 - 24:31)
that never end there is no final (24:26 - 24:33)
satisfaction I've defeated the final (24:31 - 24:37)
boss I have triumphed over this game (24:33 - 24:40)
you're just gonna be playing for you the (24:37 - 24:42)
chain is around your neck you're playing (24:40 - 24:45)
forever and but not only are you playing (24:42 - 24:47)
forever and it's like well now I'm level (24:45 - 24:50)
200 but I got nothing to do but do level (24:47 - 24:54)
five things over and over not only that (24:50 - 24:56)
but now you're having the thing by (24:54 - 25:00)
itself and it's like it shouldn't but (24:56 - 25:01)
you shouldn't that's what I'm saying (25:00 - 25:03)
they should introduce something that can (25:01 - 25:05)
say like have I need these rewards and I (25:03 - 25:08)
played it let me skip it don't yeah they (25:05 - 25:10)
should they should introduce an end and (25:08 - 25:12)
it's like all right I got some mobile (25:10 - 25:16)
games yeah I mean I I was definitely (25:12 - 25:18)
very satisfied when I got home and it (25:16 - 25:20)
was a combination of again I was I was (25:18 - 25:24)
very lucky in some of my polls but I I (25:20 - 25:26)
did enjoy waking up knowing that I would (25:24 - 25:30)
get 12 tokens three times and then the (25:26 - 25:32)
thing would go on cooldown and then I (25:30 - 25:34)
was like I get to open three loop boxes (25:32 - 25:35)
and it's possibly how oh and I did that (25:34 - 25:38)
for eight days and I got hota day so (25:35 - 25:41)
like I did feel satisfied getting home (25:38 - 25:42)
it was exciting for me to get something (25:41 - 25:44)
good in the morning good before I went (25:42 - 25:47)
to bed but but like that quest line I (25:44 - 25:50)
think on top of me finding the ho (25:47 - 25:53)
mechanics pretty pretty okay honestly (25:50 - 25:56)
and and my battle my three battles were (25:53 - 25:58)
Auto battles the fun for me was like (25:56 - 26:02)
building the team to do hoo and then and (25:58 - 26:03)
I honestly think the ho story is very (26:02 - 26:06)
good like I think the story they tell (26:03 - 26:09)
between silver and Ethan and silver (26:06 - 26:12)
having a pure heart I think everyone (26:09 - 26:15)
knows what silver well look the reward (26:12 - 26:17)
is silver and hoo I think we all know (26:15 - 26:20)
that ho goes with silver at the end but (26:17 - 26:23)
I think the story that they do in (26:20 - 26:27)
masters for ho is very good and it adds (26:23 - 26:31)
a lot of character to silver which you (26:27 - 26:34)
know is kind of portrayed as like a (26:31 - 26:38)
thief in gold and silver there is lower (26:34 - 26:40)
about silver outside of that but not (26:38 - 26:41)
like specifically in the game you kinda (26:40 - 26:43)
have to read about it and stuff um but (26:41 - 26:45)
they it's my favorite part of masters is (26:43 - 26:47)
the lore that they introduce they do a (26:45 - 26:51)
lot of great story building like the (26:47 - 26:52)
there's one section where he talks as (26:51 - 26:54)
well server talks about his dad and then (26:52 - 26:57)
you see they cut - cut - Giovanni kind (26:54 - 26:59)
of going somebody talking about me yeah (26:57 - 27:02)
no that was probably very very charming (26:59 - 27:06)
um Otto battle thing if I'm gonna be (27:02 - 27:08)
forced to grind something over and over (27:06 - 27:10)
that's gonna be the same no matter what (27:08 - 27:14)
I would prefer afraid to be Auto on some (27:10 - 27:16)
level you're only forced to grind (27:14 - 27:18)
because you have signed that contract (27:16 - 27:26)
with the only way to win is not to play (27:18 - 27:35)
at all and what's the weird dude with (27:26 - 27:37)
the cowboy (27:35 - 27:39)
buta forum who's like I just saw a hole (27:37 - 27:41)
over there and I told it to stay still (27:39 - 27:44)
and it flew away I'm like oh boy you (27:41 - 27:48)
know you talk about clay video starts up (27:44 - 27:51)
when they first introduced hoo into the (27:48 - 27:53)
game I don't remember this at all oh (27:51 - 27:57)
dude was chasing hoo and then he's like (27:53 - 27:59)
standing in a cave and he's like oh it's (27:57 - 28:02)
like a balls dude or something and he's (27:59 - 28:05)
like I can tell my master that I found (28:02 - 28:13)
this bodyguard cowboy type shirt on well (28:05 - 28:16)
also I just realized (28:13 - 28:18)
Milotic maybe shouldn't die first maybe (28:16 - 28:20)
it was Sam erat that was the weak the (28:18 - 28:22)
weak link on my team oh yeah samurai (28:20 - 28:25)
samurai sacrifice amirite all right yeah (28:22 - 28:28)
yeah it's all there to do speed get to (28:25 - 28:32)
low health so you bump everybody up Wow (28:28 - 28:34)
Milotic traps everybody in we're a pool (28:32 - 28:36)
and yeah (28:34 - 28:39)
Feraligatr wrecks house yeah for (28:36 - 28:43)
Alligator real good samurai samurai I (28:39 - 28:45)
really I really do like the ho but (28:43 - 28:47)
Milotic is a disappointing partner a (28:45 - 28:50)
little bit yeah I don't know who else (28:47 - 28:53)
you would put I mean it's the best (28:50 - 28:57)
option I just think there are the (28:53 - 29:00)
younger nuchal maybe run Palpa toad and (28:57 - 29:04)
yeah the miracle move is (29:00 - 29:08)
is pretty bad I mean the only way like (29:04 - 29:10)
the only way mere coat is is very good (29:08 - 29:15)
is if you make sure meiotic is targeted (29:10 - 29:17)
first and you somehow make sure that (29:15 - 29:20)
Milotic goes very fast like his first (29:17 - 29:23)
out of the gate but it still it eats up (29:20 - 29:26)
so much of your bar to just set up a (29:23 - 29:28)
reflect and you don't know what if it's (29:26 - 29:30)
gonna be the two losers or hoo that's (29:28 - 29:34)
gonna hit you it's not crazy pony Todd (29:30 - 29:38)

on the board apparently then write about (32:25 - 32:33)
sales numbers this is Nintendo live.com (32:27 - 32:35)
Nintendo switch has sold fifty five (32:33 - 32:38)

putting it at fifty five point seven (33:19 - 33:23)
seven million in lifetime sales software (33:20 - 33:26)
sales have totaled 168 million units (33:23 - 33:30)
which is a 42% increase year-over-year (33:26 - 33:34)
Animal Crossing saw early success and it (33:30 - 33:36)
is uh one of switches top 10 best (33:34 - 33:39)
selling games before we get to sales (33:36 - 33:43)

the Wii U at 13 point 5 6 million poor (34:24 - 34:35)
Wii U yeah that didn't sell so well I (34:31 - 34:38)
mean I bought it high fives I have mine (34:35 - 34:40)
I do too (34:38 - 34:42)
still hooked up for no apparent reason (34:40 - 34:44)
since the switch is portable just to (34:42 - 34:48)
compare that to some things here the D s (34:44 - 34:51)
sold a hundred and fifty four million (34:48 - 34:55)
units which is very very impressive (34:51 - 34:58)
of course the 3ds sold 75 million units (34:55 - 35:01)
so the switch is catching up to the 3ds (34:58 - 35:03)
although I don't know if anything's (35:01 - 35:06)
gonna catch the the popularity of the D (35:03 - 35:08)
s maybe (35:06 - 35:10)
switches I mean why she's doing really (35:08 - 35:12)
good but he sure is let's talk about (35:10 - 35:16)

game that they poured it over six point (36:48 - 36:53)
six million that my party's not that (36:50 - 36:57)
great no I mean the Mario Party is a (36:53 - 37:00)
real hit or miss it lives and dies on (36:57 - 37:01)
the minigames and the time for mini (37:00 - 37:05)
games are now on mobile so mm-hmm so the (37:01 - 37:08)
real news here is the the Pokemon news (37:05 - 37:10)
right sword and shield as of this (37:08 - 37:13)
recording is six months old seven months (37:10 - 37:13)
old (37:13 - 37:16)
well technically these sales were at the (37:13 - 37:18)
end of the fiscal year which is March I (37:16 - 37:22)
guess we don't know what happened in (37:18 - 37:26)
April and May with when that's when the (37:22 - 37:28)
pandemic stuff started but that's true (37:26 - 37:31)
yeah yeah these numbers are strictly (37:28 - 37:34)
from Nintendo's website they reported on (37:31 - 37:36)
them to their investors so obviously (37:34 - 37:38)
they should be as accurate as possible (37:36 - 37:42)
here if we focus on the sword and shield (37:38 - 37:45)
news specifically Sauron shield sold (37:42 - 37:48)
seventeen point three seven million (37:45 - 37:51)
which if we're not counting red and blue (37:48 - 37:54)
and gold and silver which were the Game (37:51 - 37:56)
Boy games and we're counting everything (37:54 - 38:00)
that is Gen three and higher when they (37:56 - 38:04)
had that split this is the second best (38:00 - 38:07)
selling game again not counting red or (38:04 - 38:08)
blue or gold silver that was some weird (38:07 - 38:12)
90 success the second best selling game (38:08 - 38:15)
besides diamond a pearl we're told but (38:12 - 38:18)
twenty three million yeah I mean it's (38:15 - 38:20)
pot I don't think sword and shield will (38:18 - 38:21)
ever pass that I don't think any game (38:20 - 38:23)
will ever get to the twenty three (38:21 - 38:25)
million that golden silver head and what (38:23 - 38:28)
the thirty five million that little blue (38:25 - 38:30)
head the initial the initial excitement (38:28 - 38:33)
is over like they made (38:30 - 38:35)
they hit the big numbers and now is just (38:33 - 38:36)
you know somewhere in between where (38:35 - 38:38)
everybody's comfortable diamond pearl (38:36 - 38:42)
seventeen point six seven million and so (38:38 - 38:45)
sword shield is literally number wise (38:42 - 38:47)
three hundred thousand away from passing (38:45 - 38:49)
diamond and pearl which would make it (38:47 - 38:53)
the best-selling game in the last twenty (38:49 - 38:55)
some years of pokemon diamond pearl did (38:53 - 38:59)
real good yeah it's so some I made a (38:55 - 39:01)
chart about this if you want to it's my (38:59 - 39:02)
pin tweet on Twitter if you want to just (39:01 - 39:05)
easily see all the Pokemon sales numbers (39:02 - 39:08)
but when Ruby and Sapphire came out that (39:05 - 39:10)
was a sixteen point to two million (39:08 - 39:13)
diamond and pearl was seventeen point (39:10 - 39:15)
six seven million black and white (39:13 - 39:19)
fifteen point six four million which is (39:15 - 39:20)
very weird because their marketing was (39:19 - 39:23)
out of control for black and white (39:20 - 39:25)
I wouldn't say out of control I would (39:23 - 39:28)
say was just right they they marketed (39:25 - 39:32)
back out of that game but I think you (39:28 - 39:35)
know if maybe if maybe reddit /youtube (39:32 - 39:38)
slash Twitter where we're a big player (39:35 - 39:41)
back then and you you did hear about (39:38 - 39:44)
people being mad that you couldn't have (39:41 - 39:46)
your playthrough of black and white with (39:44 - 39:48)
Charmander you had to beat the game but (39:46 - 39:50)
people were very upset about that (39:48 - 39:53)
fifteen point six four million X&Y (39:50 - 39:57)
sixteen point four five million Sun and (39:53 - 40:00)
Moon sixteen point one eight million and (39:57 - 40:02)
sword and shield seventeen point three (40:00 - 40:05)
seven million so III think that Sauron (40:02 - 40:06)
shields gonna pass time in a pearl (40:05 - 40:08)
they're less than a half a million away (40:06 - 40:10)
from passing it and there's another (40:08 - 40:13)
holiday coming up and there's DLC coming (40:10 - 40:15)
up so it's not like people can really (40:13 - 40:18)
wait for a different version there's (40:15 - 40:21)
another holiday coming up yeah it's (40:18 - 40:32)
Christmas and people don't buy enough (40:21 - 40:34)
stuff for that even though it's the best (40:32 - 40:36)
part of the season of May I mean I would (40:34 - 40:38)
argue that video game sales are doing (40:36 - 40:39)
really well during this time - yeah I (40:38 - 40:42)
could definitely see it over passing (40:39 - 40:44)
just because of current oh man yeah I (40:42 - 40:46)
mean I think individual (40:44 - 40:49)
I'm just curious like switches aren't (40:46 - 40:53)
cheap and a lot of people aren't making (40:49 - 40:57)
money so I don't know if that number (40:53 - 40:59)
will rise as much as we think it will (40:57 - 41:02)
given the certain current circumstances (40:59 - 41:04)
like it's definitely demand cuz they're (41:02 - 41:06)
sold out yeah and if you were to look at (41:04 - 41:08)
3d s sales when diamond and pearl (41:06 - 41:10)
obviously there wasn't a hundred and (41:08 - 41:12)
fifty million (41:10 - 41:16)
ds's when diamond Pro came out there was (41:12 - 41:18)
115 million ds's near the end of that (41:16 - 41:20)
lifecycle but that's three times the (41:18 - 41:23)
amount of hardware out then the switch (41:20 - 41:27)
there's only 55 million switches in (41:23 - 41:29)
people's hands I guess I don't know how (41:27 - 41:31)
many are stuck on a boat or in the back (41:29 - 41:34)
of a Walmart right now probably none (41:31 - 41:35)
because they're not making them as fast (41:34 - 41:38)
the fast enough this this number is like (41:35 - 41:40)
super impressive just in general but (41:38 - 41:42)
this number is gonna get weird once DLC (41:40 - 41:43)
comes out because like Ruby and Sapphire (41:42 - 41:46)
sold 16 million copies and then emerald (41:43 - 41:49)
sold another six and then like Sunnat (41:46 - 41:51)
our Sun and Moon sold 16 million and (41:49 - 41:53)
then ultra Sun and Moon sold 8 million (41:51 - 41:56)
so I don't know if Sauron Shields gonna (41:53 - 41:59)
sell another 6 million copies because of (41:56 - 42:03)
the G LC LC I I would argue that if the (41:59 - 42:09)
DLC is strong that it will yeah because (42:03 - 42:11)
because people will well number one (42:09 - 42:14)
they're adding more pokemon in yep which (42:11 - 42:18)
is gonna get people excited but yeah (42:14 - 42:20)
just people will like if it's really (42:18 - 42:22)
good DLC they're gonna say oh hey this (42:20 - 42:25)
is what I was waiting for and then you (42:22 - 42:28)
know and kind of the steam of being so (42:25 - 42:31)
burned by what they feel as a slight (42:28 - 42:33)
from the Pokemon company will have kind (42:31 - 42:36)
of passed a little bit as well and I (42:33 - 42:37)
feel like it feels a little different (42:36 - 42:39)
with DLC as well you're getting the base (42:37 - 42:41)
game and you can choose whether or not (42:39 - 42:44)
to pay more or extra for the DLC whereas (42:41 - 42:47)
emerald and an ultra Sun and Moon were (42:44 - 42:49)
completely separate game so you had to (42:47 - 42:51)
choose whether or not to get the (42:49 - 42:55)
original or get the third version you (42:51 - 42:57)
will yeah and we (42:55 - 42:59)
we knew that we know there there are (42:57 - 43:02)
there were players that were like oh I'm (42:59 - 43:04)
just gonna wait for the third one yeah (43:02 - 43:06)
absolutely kind of figured that around (43:04 - 43:07)
forever yep (43:06 - 43:11)
no you can't you have to commit if (43:07 - 43:13)
nothing gets delayed the DLC is next (43:11 - 43:15)
month probably at the end of the month (43:13 - 43:17)
but do they put out like a retail (43:15 - 43:19)
version in November assuming that the (43:17 - 43:21)
second set of DLC is in November where (43:19 - 43:24)
it's a cartridge with both DLCs on it (43:21 - 43:27)
for 60 or 70 bucks like maybe a (43:24 - 43:29)
discounted price but maybe just at 60 (43:27 - 43:31)
bucks and you get the DLC on shelves for (43:29 - 43:34)
the holiday yes they absolutely do (43:31 - 43:36)
because I feel like you just don't know (43:34 - 43:38)
like a deluxe edition yeah like a deluxe (43:36 - 43:40)
edition with DLC like this is sword and (43:38 - 43:42)
shield Plus both DLCs on the cartridge (43:40 - 43:46)
in a box on the shelf yes too long (43:42 - 43:49)
didn't read boycott didn't work person (43:46 - 43:53)
she because I didn't tell Japan and it (43:49 - 43:53)
was too late (43:53 - 43:54)
yeah they didn't tell Japan about the (43:53 - 43:57)
boycott Pokemon and go alive let's get (43:54 - 43:59)
this Pokemon good news out of the way (43:57 - 44:01)
two things one there was a snubbull day (43:59 - 44:03)
thing today we're recording this on a (44:01 - 44:04)
Saturday night I don't know if you guys (44:03 - 44:08)

I was getting asleep (44:08 - 44:14)
alright well as somebody who played this (44:11 - 44:19)
novel day it was pretty good they did uh (44:14 - 44:25)
it was 2020 tasks of three or twenty (44:19 - 44:28)
quests like it was a 20-point quest line (44:25 - 44:30)
each quest had three things or whatever (44:28 - 44:32)
they call it so sixty things all (44:30 - 44:35)

electric pokemon down here in south (48:13 - 48:18)
Minneapolis we we know we don't have (48:15 - 48:21)
those like I looked I said I have five (48:18 - 48:23)
hours left there's no way I can get (48:21 - 48:26)
through six stages done but what's (48:23 - 48:30)
really awful about that is now I have (48:26 - 48:34)
zero incentive to do any of the other (48:30 - 48:36)
challenges because the whole point is (48:34 - 48:38)
you do all of the challenges and then (48:36 - 48:41)
you get invited to that final you're the (48:38 - 48:43)
Genesis again yeah yeah (48:41 - 48:44)
and it's like well I'm there's no way (48:43 - 48:47)
I'm gonna be getting that so not gonna (48:44 - 48:52)
bother with the rest of it I sent them (48:47 - 48:54)
lying to myself I already paid money for (48:52 - 48:55)
the genesect I just didn't complete that (48:54 - 48:58)
mission either Wednesday of next week (48:55 - 49:00)
I'm gonna look let me do the Giotto (48:58 - 49:03)
challenge and then if you like Friday (49:00 - 49:05)
more day I'm gonna be like wait I have (49:03 - 49:07)
five more stages to complete never gonna (49:05 - 49:10)
get this done alright that's my (49:07 - 49:14)
complaint but the the canto challenges (49:10 - 49:15)
was actually set up pretty cool so if (49:14 - 49:18)
you followed it it actually followed the (49:15 - 49:20)
canto line so for example the first (49:18 - 49:23)
quest was catch a grass water catch (49:20 - 49:24)
three grass water or fire pokemon that's (49:23 - 49:26)
obviously the Pokemon you start with (49:24 - 49:29)
then it's snapshot at bug type Pokemon (49:26 - 49:30)
so that would be like the forest and (49:29 - 49:32)
then it's catching a rock pokémon which (49:30 - 49:33)
would be like mountain moon and then the (49:32 - 49:37)
first reward for doing those three is (49:33 - 49:39)
onyx which is rocks Pokemon (49:37 - 49:41)
and then it's battle in a raid which (49:39 - 49:42)
gets you close re which would also be (49:41 - 49:45)
Mountain and then transfer three Pokemon (49:42 - 49:46)
which is probably like a reference to (49:45 - 49:48)
like meeting bill and then catch a water (49:46 - 49:50)
type Pokemon because you're in cerulean (49:48 - 49:51)
city and then the reward for that is (49:50 - 49:53)
star me which is Missy's Pokemon and (49:51 - 49:56)
then you evolve through Pokemon which I (49:53 - 49:59)
guess would be like the breeder or the (49:56 - 50:01)
daycare and then its hatch an egg well (49:59 - 50:02)
maybe that's the daycare which gets you (50:01 - 50:04)
Snorlax but Snorlax appears to blood (50:02 - 50:05)
blocking your route and then you catch (50:04 - 50:07)
an electric pokemon because you're in (50:05 - 50:08)
Viridian City and then you catch a ride (50:07 - 50:11)
too which is lieutenant surges and then (50:08 - 50:13)
you have to give your buddy a treat (50:11 - 50:15)
which will get you a gastly which would (50:13 - 50:17)
then show lavender Tower and then you (50:15 - 50:19)
would give a gift to a friend which (50:17 - 50:21)
would be the dratini in the game corner (50:19 - 50:24)
which is right before Erica which that (50:21 - 50:26)
if you do all do it those then you get (50:24 - 50:29)
Tangela and then Chauncey shows up which (50:26 - 50:31)
is safari zone and then that leads into (50:29 - 50:33)
you getting a wheezing which is Koga (50:31 - 50:35)
then if you take a picture of a ghost (50:33 - 50:37)
type Pokemon Lapras appears which is (50:35 - 50:39)
sylco and then Hitmonchan which is that (50:37 - 50:40)
fighting dojo and then you do all that (50:39 - 50:45)
and you get Alakazam and then there's a (50:40 - 50:46)
Volvo Pokemon gets you in Aerodactyl (50:45 - 50:48)
which would be the cinnabar and then (50:46 - 50:50)
that Pokemon would be Arcanine which I (50:48 - 50:52)
think Blaine has a Narconon probably in (50:50 - 50:54)
one of the games number nine out of (50:52 - 50:56)
eight was neato King which is Giovanni (50:54 - 50:58)
and then the final one gets you me too (50:56 - 51:00)
so they actually the Kanto quest line (50:58 - 51:04)
told a pretty cool story that probably 9 (51:00 - 51:06)
out of 10 people didn't even notice nor (51:04 - 51:14)
care well didn't notice now I care the (51:06 - 51:16)
johto one does like a slightly similar (51:14 - 51:18)
thing except Joe chose a bad region and (51:16 - 51:19)
all the johto Gym Leaders have bad (51:18 - 51:22)
Pokemon for example Falkner has a Pidgey (51:19 - 51:26)
and a pidgeotto and Marty has Haunter (51:22 - 51:28)
Haunter and Gengar I think the only gym (51:26 - 51:31)
leaders that actually used Johto Pokemon (51:28 - 51:34)
were like Jasmine and that was only one (51:31 - 51:36)
of her Pokemon word Johto which was (51:34 - 51:40)
steelix and then I think Bryce oh (51:36 - 51:41)
Whitney has a metal tank yeah that's (51:40 - 51:43)
true she's a Clefairy though what was (51:41 - 51:45)
that dude the macho dude he uses like a (51:43 - 51:48)
primeape and a Poliwrath even though (51:45 - 51:50)
they introduced like him on top in that (51:48 - 51:53)
region but they didn't give it to him (51:50 - 51:54)
I don't know and they had like 18 birds (51:53 - 51:56)
in that region like Noctowl and (51:54 - 51:58)
hoot-hoot and they gave Faulkner a (51:56 - 52:04)
pidgeotto man that region bums me so (51:58 - 52:06)
they do it is modified I think like the (52:04 - 52:07)
first quest of the johto does get you (52:06 - 52:10)
like Noctowl I think or I ought to or (52:07 - 52:12)
something so it's like slightly modified (52:10 - 52:14)
to be more Johto Pokemon but it kind of (52:12 - 52:17)
tells like a similar story so I would (52:14 - 52:21)
expect the same for Hoenn and Sinnoh (52:17 - 52:23)
when those come around (52:21 - 52:24)
it is weird though yeah I didn't think (52:23 - 52:26)
about that if you missed out on the (52:24 - 52:28)
Kanto now it's almost like you don't (52:26 - 52:30)
have any motivation to do the next ones (52:28 - 52:31)
because you can't get into the genesect (52:30 - 52:35)
now genocide thing now yep note that (52:31 - 52:39)
today infection was that's the section (52:35 - 52:41)
you get to look at now and not (52:39 - 52:43)
participate (52:41 - 52:43)
um poke mango is going to do this is off (52:44 - 52:50)
Pokemon go live as well we were running (52:48 - 52:52)
small tests to revamp the pokey coin a (52:50 - 52:57)
system I don't know if people just like (52:52 - 52:58)
this as much as I like that does the (52:57 - 53:00)
Masters news but there was people with (52:58 - 53:03)
their hot takes on this as well yep (53:00 - 53:05)
there were right now the only way to (53:03 - 53:07)
earn coins is to defend gems but then (53:05 - 53:09)
since the Pokemon goes release we've (53:07 - 53:11)
added features to vastly change the way (53:09 - 53:12)
you play in addition with more trainers (53:11 - 53:14)
playing at home we are looking to (53:12 - 53:16)
provide ways for pokey coins in one (53:14 - 53:18)
place so in the future we will be (53:16 - 53:20)
rewarding you pokey coins for activities (53:18 - 53:22)
besides defending gyms we are doing this (53:20 - 53:24)
test in Australia and will be coming to (53:22 - 53:26)
trainers after the testing phase in (53:24 - 53:29)
order to balance the new method of coins (53:26 - 53:32)
the number of coins earned from (53:29 - 53:35)
defending gems will be reduced from 6 (53:32 - 53:39)
hours to to 6 per hour Oh (53:35 - 53:42)
- pearl yeah I was like 6 hours in two (53:39 - 53:46)
hours no you get 6 per hour before right (53:42 - 53:49)
you want to every 10 minutes now it is (53:46 - 53:53)
one coin every 30 minutes maximum coins (53:49 - 53:57)
you can earn will be 55 instead of 50 (53:53 - 54:00)
here are some of the daily activities (53:57 - 54:03)
you might see complete the featured (54:00 - 54:06)
activities to receive 5 pokey coins make (54:03 - 54:08)
an excellent throw of all the pokemon (54:06 - 54:10)
make a great throw use a berry to help (54:08 - 54:12)
catch a Pokemon take snapshot catch a (54:10 - 54:15)
Pokemon powerup a Pokemon make a nice (54:12 - 54:17)
thorough transfer of Pokemon winter raid (54:15 - 54:19)
during the initial rollout in Australia (54:17 - 54:21)
we will collect feedback and perform (54:19 - 54:23)
additional testing based on the results (54:21 - 54:25)
thank you for the continued support we (54:23 - 54:28)
look forward to providing you an update (54:25 - 54:30)
to all trainers once testing is complete (54:28 - 54:32)
please stay tuned to official channels (54:30 - 54:35)
I'm still confused about this I don't (54:32 - 54:36)
think anyone has a right answer unless (54:35 - 54:38)
there was an update but it says to me it (54:36 - 54:40)
says here are some of the daily (54:38 - 54:43)
activities you might see complete the (54:40 - 54:45)
featured activities each day to receive (54:43 - 54:49)
5 coins and then they list from making (54:45 - 54:51)
an excellent throw to winning a raid (54:49 - 54:54)
which I don't do those 2 every day well (54:51 - 54:56)
maybe I guess I could maybe care about (54:54 - 54:58)
an X alone throw (54:56 - 55:00)
but that's like selectively a like (54:58 - 55:01)
certain Pokemon are easier than others (55:00 - 55:04)
true and you do get a rate pass every (55:01 - 55:06)
day but that's assuming that you want to (55:04 - 55:09)
leave your house to do a raid so are (55:06 - 55:11)
they saying I have to do two four six (55:09 - 55:13)
eight nine things to get five coins or (55:11 - 55:15)
am I getting one coin per each thing (55:13 - 55:17)
there's nine things but I don't have to (55:15 - 55:19)
do five of them like this is really (55:17 - 55:21)
unclear of what they're asking us to do (55:19 - 55:24)
they're also not saying that that's a (55:21 - 55:26)
complete list and they start off saying (55:24 - 55:28)
here are some of the daily activities (55:26 - 55:31)
but then they say complete the featured (55:28 - 55:33)
activities each day to receive five (55:31 - 55:35)
coins so I have a feeling it's gonna be (55:33 - 55:37)
like a section on the today tab where (55:35 - 55:41)
random things are gonna pull up and if (55:37 - 55:43)
you do like the three random things you (55:41 - 55:45)
get the five point you get the five (55:43 - 55:50)
coins it's one you get one coin maybe (55:45 - 55:53)
per task and then there's like like if (55:50 - 55:54)
you complete all of them then they suck (55:53 - 55:57)
a bonus type thanks if I recall (55:54 - 56:01)
correctly I think Wizards United doesn't (55:57 - 56:06)
do this um Harry Potter is insider info (56:01 - 56:10)
I also I haven't played that longer much (56:06 - 56:14)
longer than I haven't played for the (56:10 - 56:18)
best honestly if I recall correctly I (56:14 - 56:22)
mean what my take would be is because (56:18 - 56:24)
this is combined with them reducing the (56:22 - 56:26)
number of coins you get from defending a (56:24 - 56:29)
gym is that you would just get five (56:26 - 56:32)
coins for each of the activities no no (56:29 - 56:35)
no it was you get complete the featured (56:32 - 56:38)
activities to receive five coins yeah so (56:35 - 56:40)
that I don't think each activity is (56:38 - 56:42)
worth five coins I mean that's your (56:40 - 56:44)
opinion I have it you think caching your (56:42 - 56:45)
Pokemon they're gonna give you five (56:44 - 56:49)
pennies heck no the first time you catch (56:45 - 56:50)
a Pokemon a day yeah (56:49 - 56:53)
yeah they give you five coins you ain't (56:50 - 56:55)
gonna buy much with five coins friend (56:53 - 56:57)
area ster if you got that 7-day streak (56:55 - 57:02)
they get the five days I think ago (56:57 - 57:04)
anyway I think no to meet the second (57:02 - 57:07)
sentence says complete the featured (57:04 - 57:10)
activities with an S each day to receive (57:07 - 57:12)
five coins so I think (57:10 - 57:14)
that there's gonna be a list of like (57:12 - 57:15)
three things you do all three you get (57:14 - 57:18)
five coins that's it that's all you get (57:15 - 57:21)
I mean that's sad it's almost not even (57:18 - 57:25)
worth getting out of bed hey take a (57:21 - 57:27)
snapshot catch a Pokemon have a nice (57:25 - 57:29)
throw you're gonna be doing that anyways (57:27 - 57:34)
yeah so I don't see take no snapshots I (57:29 - 57:36)
mean the thing is is like right now the (57:34 - 57:40)
coin system to earn coins is very (57:36 - 57:42)
dependent if you can find a gym (57:40 - 57:44)
particularly good if you if that gym is (57:42 - 57:46)
in a remote location that doesn't see a (57:44 - 57:50)
lot of people or in the case of downtown (57:46 - 57:52)
Minneapolis if you can manage to stay (57:50 - 57:54)
downtown at five when everybody leaves (57:52 - 57:58)
and then find one open and dump one in (57:54 - 58:02)
it will last all night but like the gym (57:58 - 58:05)
thing to earn coins was very limiting (58:02 - 58:11)
very luck based and really like I mean (58:05 - 58:12)
it's pretty easy to get 50 coins if you (58:11 - 58:16)
live in a city and you have like I mean (58:12 - 58:19)
this is the unfairness of Pokemon go but (58:16 - 58:23)
if in a perfect world meet Greg Britney (58:19 - 58:26)
and will lived in the same area and we (58:23 - 58:28)
were all on the same team and we played (58:26 - 58:30)
Pokemon go in the evenings together as (58:28 - 58:32)
friends do it would be very easy for us (58:30 - 58:35)
to take any number of gyms we walk by (58:32 - 58:37)
and they would probably be very safe (58:35 - 58:39)
overnight and we would all get 50 coins (58:37 - 58:43)
every day in an ideal world yeah but you (58:39 - 58:46)
are wrong I don't know if ideal is the (58:43 - 58:49)
word for it we're people walking past (58:46 - 58:51)
the gym knocking it out is very quick (58:49 - 58:53)
and off-putting for Pokemon in is (58:51 - 58:55)
totally different than one person (58:53 - 58:58)
spending anywhere between you know five (58:55 - 59:00)
to 15 minutes to knock out the gym so (58:58 - 59:02)
low and then put one pokemon in and then (59:00 - 59:04)
somebody else driving by or walking by (59:02 - 59:06)
being like oh there's only one pokemon (59:04 - 59:08)
here I'm gonna take this because we're (59:06 - 59:11)
we are all that people we were all those (59:08 - 59:13)
people that will walk by a gym with six (59:11 - 59:15)
pokemon in and go nope no not interested (59:13 - 59:17)
but if all six poke might have one (59:15 - 59:19)
agency true you better believe you'd be (59:17 - 59:22)
like I'm taking this but the problem is (59:19 - 59:23)
you're putting one in and they're you're (59:22 - 59:25)
not putting like two in or three or four (59:23 - 59:26)
in which then (59:25 - 59:27)
somebody else is gonna be like only one (59:26 - 59:30)
easy to do I think it's cool that they (59:27 - 59:32)
give that giving you another way to earn (59:30 - 59:35)
coins I think that I've the chimp system (59:32 - 59:37)
I think is fine I'm sick of hearing (59:35 - 59:39)
people being like it needs to be a (59:37 - 59:41)
hundred coins like it used to be no the (59:39 - 59:44)
old gym system was so incredibly garbage (59:41 - 59:45)
and broken you had to go through like (59:44 - 59:48)
nine layers of Pokemon just to get to (59:45 - 59:50)
the end to even put a Pokemon in and (59:48 - 59:52)
then it would get knocked out right away (59:50 - 59:55)
like the amount of people claiming that (59:52 - 59:56)
they were earning a hundred coins a day (59:55 - 59:59)
they were like the zero zero zero one (59:56 - 60:02)
percent and the amount of time you had (59:59 - 60:05)
to invest for one dollar was ridiculous (60:02 - 60:08)
now if there's six Pokemon in a gym and (60:05 - 60:10)
they're fully powered up that's not (60:08 - 60:12)
worth my even if I was with a friend I (60:10 - 60:14)
don't think that's worth fifteen minutes (60:12 - 60:16)
for 50 cents and if you were like oh (60:14 - 60:18)
well it'sit's gonna be worth a dollar I (60:16 - 60:20)
don't know I can make I could make a (60:18 - 60:24)
dollar in 15 minutes it's Danny about (60:20 - 60:26)
the money it's about the pride of (60:24 - 60:29)
achievement now that they're changing (60:26 - 60:34)
this from six-six per hour to to per (60:29 - 60:36)
hour uh what's the math on that how many (60:34 - 60:38)
hours is that to be in a gym to get max (60:36 - 60:42)
ten hours right no eight hours 36 times (60:38 - 60:47)
5 42 48 Hey oh yeah close that it has to (60:42 - 60:49)
be in a gym for 8 hours and now it has (60:47 - 60:53)
to be in a gym for yeah 25 hours so yeah (60:49 - 60:56)
then then I'd be waking up to like 26 (60:53 - 60:58)
cents instead of 50 cents I don't know (60:56 - 61:00)
anything that requires me to leave my (60:58 - 61:02)
house if I'm not already planning to (61:00 - 61:12)
leave that wrong no I prefer masters in (61:02 - 61:15)
this case to the ground over cook might (61:12 - 61:18)
go I'm assuming via daily activities you (61:15 - 61:20)
only get as five so if you're doing it (61:18 - 61:23)
every day that's 35 coins a week by (61:20 - 61:26)
doing the whatever the future activities (61:23 - 61:28)
is yeah if you're maxing out at five a (61:26 - 61:31)
day that's 35 coins a week (61:28 - 61:33)
and if you're maxing out gyms every day (61:31 - 61:37)
that's 350 coins a week and if your mac (61:33 - 61:43)
saying gyms and coins a day you're up to (61:37 - 61:47)
385 coins a week and we you're stopped (61:43 - 61:49)
at the 55 right each day no matter what (61:47 - 61:52)
you do compassion right yeah now that (61:49 - 61:53)
I'm thinking about it I feel like 6 2 2 (61:52 - 61:54)
is not great (61:53 - 61:58)
maybe like 6 to 4 or 6 to 3 I'd feel (61:54 - 62:01)
better about but saying a pokemon has to (61:58 - 62:03)
be in a gym for 25 hours to max it out (62:01 - 62:06)
or take three gyms at night to like (62:03 - 62:10)

your Pokemon in the gym locks from 9 to (62:27 - 62:32)
6 and then you're golden because (62:29 - 62:39)
Milwaukee has that is what you're doing (62:32 - 62:42)
but most most Pokemon I've left in gyms (62:39 - 62:44)

somebody does fanart for it yeah and the (64:10 - 64:15)
Pokemon Panther grandma cross my heart (64:13 - 64:17)
I'd be like yeah I would play that game (64:15 - 64:21)
forever but I would could only have 10 (64:17 - 64:23)
which is even harder than picking your (64:21 - 64:25)
team of six you have 10 people I'm gonna (64:23 - 64:30)
be like do they evolved is each line its (64:25 - 64:34)
own like is there a buddy villager or (64:30 - 64:36)
Roselia villager and then a rose raid (64:34 - 64:38)
villager or is it just the final level (64:36 - 64:40)
like now I feel like maybe some limit (64:38 - 64:42)
where they like we're only including to (64:40 - 64:45)
it like what they do in Animal Crossing (64:42 - 64:46)
to exit I see (64:45 - 64:48)
well they do that a mystery dungeon you (64:46 - 64:49)
can't get all the pokemon mystery (64:48 - 64:52)
dungeon yeah but they can't evolve I'm (64:49 - 64:55)
just saying do they have set or the eyes (64:52 - 64:57)
there Oh as your friendship grows does (64:55 - 65:02)
your does your villagers of all your (64:57 - 65:06)
villager suddenly evolving into some (65:02 - 65:09)
peace they want counters change all the (65:06 - 65:11)
time anyways yeah but no one wants a (65:09 - 65:14)
Wailord villager anyway the camp in the (65:11 - 65:17)
house they had a weird (65:14 - 65:20)
what happened did you have Wailord and (65:17 - 65:22)
skiddy in your town do they take in the (65:20 - 65:26)
count the egg groups can you hatch (65:22 - 65:38)
villagers hatching no no no then they (65:26 - 65:46)
would have to introduce a day me I don't (65:38 - 65:48)
all honestly I was thinking about this (65:46 - 65:50)
and I don't think that like I don't (65:48 - 65:54)
think that even if there was a crossover (65:50 - 65:58)
like even if it was like Pokemon or did (65:54 - 66:01)
you Mon or like Mario characters I just (65:58 - 66:04)
think that at a certain point no matter (66:01 - 66:06)
what like if it's your favorite series (66:04 - 66:08)
and it's animal crossing and you don't (66:06 - 66:09)
like animal crossing you're not gonna (66:08 - 66:11)
get it like at a certain point it's just (66:09 - 66:14)
that game is not you can put monster (66:11 - 66:16)
hundred one of my favorite series into (66:14 - 66:18)
drag Algy a loss I still don't want to (66:16 - 66:20)
play for yogi lajas like I just don't (66:18 - 66:22)
and that event was really good and the (66:20 - 66:24)
fights were really fun and they married (66:22 - 66:26)
what happened in animal and in mouse or (66:24 - 66:28)
hunt and so it's like it was really well (66:26 - 66:30)
done it's like new but Nagas ambition I (66:28 - 66:32)
was like mmhmm yeah there was many (66:30 - 66:34)
Pokemon as you want in they're not gonna (66:32 - 66:37)
touch it and now my main character can (66:34 - 66:39)
transform into Rathalos so it's that (66:37 - 66:41)
sounds awesome that actually sounds real (66:39 - 66:41)
cool (66:41 - 66:43)
well like because I've been playing so (66:41 - 66:44)
much Pokemon and so much Animal Crossing (66:43 - 66:46)
on Twitch there's just like there (66:44 - 66:48)
there's a certain set of people that are (66:46 - 66:50)
watching me just because they like to (66:48 - 66:51)
watch me but they're like man I just (66:50 - 66:53)
animal Crossing's not for me and it's (66:51 - 66:54)
like what if they were Pokemon they're (66:53 - 66:56)
like I just don't want to pick weeds and (66:54 - 66:59)
like sell turnips and it's like I get it (66:56 - 67:02)

weeds and sultriness either but here we (67:02 - 67:04)
are (67:04 - 67:07)
I mean you don't have to pick the weeds (67:04 - 67:09)

messy island you just pay somebody else (67:09 - 67:16)
to pick the weeds like real life okay (67:12 - 67:19)

pleasures are constricted by its own (72:11 - 72:17)
absurdity but creature feature fans may (72:13 - 72:20)
enjoy its brazen silliness with the (72:17 - 72:23)
description a documentary film crew (72:20 - 72:26)
journeys to the depths of the Amazon in (72:23 - 72:28)
search of the mysterious shirishama (72:26 - 72:31)

gargantuan insatiable snake that (72:31 - 72:37)
squeezes its prey to death eats it whole (72:33 - 72:40)
regurgitates it and then eats it again (72:37 - 72:44)
IMDB describes the 1997 film with a (72:40 - 72:47)
National Geographic film crew is taken (72:44 - 72:49)
hostage by an insane hunter who forces (72:47 - 72:51)
them along in his quest to capture the (72:49 - 72:55)

American adventure horror film directed (73:00 - 73:06)
by Lewis Yosa and starring Jennifer (73:03 - 73:10)
Lopez Ice Cube Jon Voight Eric Stoltz (73:06 - 73:16)
Jonathan Hyde and Owen Wilson faces why (73:10 - 73:19)

titles such as the hunt for the blood (73:51 - 73:59)
orchid offspring trail of blood lake (73:54 - 74:03)
placid verse this movie no the main (73:59 - 74:06)
thing to consider here is and this is (74:03 - 74:09)
the important point folks what if this (74:06 - 74:13)
movie took place in a desert instead of (74:09 - 74:18)
the Amazon there you go (74:13 - 74:29)
the cats just get worse and worse no (74:18 - 74:29)
