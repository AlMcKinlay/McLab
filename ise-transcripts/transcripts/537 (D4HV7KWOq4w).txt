the first Pokemon Centric podcast that I (1:43 - 1:49)
have been on since I was in high school (1:46 - 1:54)
is a lot of qualifiers right there (1:49 - 1:54)
narrow the category down to make it a (1:55 - 2:02)
first no no no no to be hosted podcasts (1:58 - 2:05)
that started in 2010 and has been going (2:02 - 2:06)
for this song that's Pokemon specific (2:05 - 2:08)
that has one host named Craig and one (2:06 - 2:10)
host named Steve that I've been on (2:08 - 2:13)
you're the first you're the first no the (2:10 - 2:14)
last time I was on specifically a (2:13 - 2:18)
Pokemon podcast was the Boba cast and (2:14 - 2:20)
this was like prenating going on like (2:18 - 2:22)
yeah I wasn't even like Roger's base at (2:20 - 2:24)
the time I was going by like Nintendo (2:22 - 2:26)
Theater which is like my old old name (2:24 - 2:28)
when I was like a boba Wiki editor (2:26 - 2:30)
person so yeah this is like way back in (2:28 - 2:32)
the day this was when Battle Frontier (2:30 - 2:35)
was airing in North America and I was (2:32 - 2:37)
going on Sarah B looking for the little (2:35 - 2:39)
screenshots from the episodes and I'm (2:37 - 2:42)
freaking out when Sceptile finally (2:39 - 2:45)
evolved and so that's how long it's been (2:42 - 2:47)
so I'm happy to be back in the game I (2:45 - 2:51)
forgot the bubblecast was a thing yeah (2:47 - 2:51)
uh I think they I think before the (2:52 - 2:56)
pandemic they tried to start it up again (2:55 - 2:58)
and then I don't I don't think it made (2:56 - 3:01)
it but you know you guys compete with (2:58 - 3:03)
they said too bad it's super too bad (3:01 - 3:05)
it's just too good there's only one (3:03 - 3:07)
yeah I mean we I'm not saying we (3:05 - 3:09)
actively hunt down other Pokemon (3:07 - 3:11)
podcasts and make them pay and suffer (3:09 - 3:14)
but I'm not saying you don't (3:11 - 3:14)
um so we have uh we have a new Pokemon (3:15 - 3:19)
to talk about we have some other Pokemon (3:18 - 3:22)
news to talk about uh the paldea TCG (3:19 - 3:23)
stuff is actually coming we're gonna get (3:22 - 3:26)
Roger's thoughts on gen 9. uh before we (3:23 - 3:28)
get into that what's super funny is (3:26 - 3:31)
Roger and I met at Worlds uh I was (3:28 - 3:33)
setting up a live stream to react to the (3:31 - 3:36)
finals in our like fancy secret media (3:33 - 3:38)
room uh and I when I was setting up (3:36 - 3:41)
Roger pointed out that uh we met prior (3:38 - 3:44)
to this yes years ago years and years (3:41 - 3:46)
and years ago 10 years ago because I (3:44 - 3:48)
used to go to a show called c2e2 and I (3:46 - 3:50)
would I would like speak or do a panel (3:48 - 3:53)
there and apparently Roger was also (3:50 - 3:54)
doing that but his was always like (3:53 - 3:56)
around my time or like same room but (3:54 - 4:00)
like before or after yep we would always (3:56 - 4:01)
just miss each other for like years (4:00 - 4:04)
because we were doing the live shows I (4:01 - 4:07)
for Japan time like I think 2013 14 and (4:04 - 4:09)
no no it would have been 14 15 and 16 (4:07 - 4:11)
and then we took a break year and then (4:09 - 4:14)
went back in 2018 and for the 2014 and (4:11 - 4:16)
25th 15 year if I'm remembering (4:14 - 4:18)
correctly your guys's panel was either (4:16 - 4:21)
at the same time or was like the same (4:18 - 4:23)
day with an hour difference between our (4:21 - 4:25)
panel and I always wanted to catch your (4:23 - 4:27)
panel because I'm like I like Pokemon I (4:25 - 4:29)
think I would like these guys and I (4:27 - 4:30)
could never end up making it so yeah (4:29 - 4:32)
it's it's wild that we're actually (4:30 - 4:34)
finally here but we did meet (4:32 - 4:35)
um I actually think initially it wasn't (4:34 - 4:39)
at c2e2 it was at anime Central because (4:35 - 4:41)
I did catch a panel that you guys did at (4:39 - 4:44)
anime Central for Pokemon and we had (4:41 - 4:45)
talked briefly afterwards so I think (4:44 - 4:47)
that was actually our first meeting (4:45 - 4:50)
which city was that in Chicago yeah it (4:47 - 4:54)
was Chicago oh okay yeah I gosh I don't (4:50 - 4:57)
I I don't remember a lot from 10 years (4:54 - 5:00)
ago no I know to be fair it's just when (4:57 - 5:02)
I remember certain shows or certain (5:00 - 5:03)
people (5:02 - 5:06)
the core memories get unlocked so got it (5:03 - 5:08)
yeah (5:06 - 5:11)
um nice being young (5:08 - 5:11)
uh all right well let's let's start off (5:13 - 5:18)
with uh the first bit of Pokemon news (5:16 - 5:19)
here and we're just gonna go with the (5:18 - 5:22)
scarlet and violet which is uh there's a (5:19 - 5:24)
new Pokemon uh I struggle to say this (5:22 - 5:26)
name it's uh like a Saint Bernard right (5:24 - 5:28)
is that what the dog is supposed to do (5:26 - 5:31)
well it's not a Saint Bernard it's a it (5:28 - 5:34)
is a it is a type of dog in that family (5:31 - 5:36)
it it's it doesn't have the coloring of (5:34 - 5:38)
a Saint Bernard or the size of his hate (5:36 - 5:41)
Bernard but it can assume that the last (5:38 - 5:44)
part is Ard so if you take the first (5:41 - 5:49)
part is grieving yeah grievard (5:44 - 5:52)
yeah we do need to we need to talk about (5:49 - 5:54)
how many people (5:52 - 5:57)
is the Pokemon company willing to kill (5:54 - 5:59)
for footage at this point (5:57 - 6:02)
Professor Willow died that person died (5:59 - 6:05)
in the snow this person died in a (6:02 - 6:07)
graveyard four random people died for (6:05 - 6:10)
Ultra beasts this company is becoming a (6:07 - 6:13)
menace and we are we are we are (6:10 - 6:17)
complicit in Murder to be fair see I'm (6:13 - 6:18)
used to it you were talking about this (6:17 - 6:19)
beforehand you were like how could you (6:18 - 6:22)
be so callous but realistically I am (6:19 - 6:24)
used to Smash Brothers Trailers and (6:22 - 6:26)
literally Mario dies every trailer he (6:24 - 6:29)
gets stabbed by sephiroth Luigi gets (6:26 - 6:31)
ripped up by a scythe in the Castlevania (6:29 - 6:34)
Castle Mega Man literally gets impaled (6:31 - 6:39)
by Ridley so I we know that (6:34 - 6:41)
Super Smash Brothers takes place in an (6:39 - 6:43)
alternate universe where they are forced (6:41 - 6:44)
to live out their Immortal lives never (6:43 - 6:48)
being free forever having to fight for (6:44 - 6:49)
the sins that they committed during (6:48 - 6:51)
their life including mass murder of (6:49 - 6:54)
goombas like we know why they're there (6:51 - 6:56)
they are punished for a reason why is (6:54 - 6:58)
Pikachu being punished why is Jigglypuff (6:56 - 7:01)
punished they didn't kill anybody (6:58 - 7:03)
really (7:01 - 7:05)
Pikachu killed really have you let's (7:03 - 7:07)
have the same conversation have you not (7:05 - 7:10)
seen how many times they he Pikachu has (7:07 - 7:12)
electrified Ash to death and they had to (7:10 - 7:14)
bring out another clone why do you think (7:12 - 7:17)
Ash is only 10. this is how many clone (7:14 - 7:19)
bodies they've gone through because (7:17 - 7:22)
Pikachu is a menace meanwhile Brock gets (7:19 - 7:25)
a rocket ship because rock is allowed to (7:22 - 7:27)
live an entire life (7:25 - 7:30)
and Ash has to start over every season (7:27 - 7:33)
because Pikachu has to kill him bring in (7:30 - 7:35)
another clone (7:33 - 7:37)
is there a difference between a Saint (7:35 - 7:40)
Bernard and a Bernard or is this are (7:37 - 7:42)
those two different dogs I actually have (7:40 - 7:44)
no idea the Saint Bernard and a Bernard (7:42 - 7:47)
yeah you're asking the wrong person I've (7:44 - 7:48)
always had mutts and then right now I (7:47 - 7:50)
have a Pomeranian so it's like (7:48 - 7:51)
completely (7:50 - 7:53)
full in the slightest for this (7:51 - 7:55)
conversation (7:53 - 7:57)
well Greg said that Saint Bernards are (7:55 - 7:59)
really big so I was like oh it was huge (7:57 - 8:01)
is is there just a regular banana (7:59 - 8:06)
there's not a Bernard as a dog (8:01 - 8:06)
yeah Saint Bernard is the name of that (8:07 - 8:13)
specific breed and I forget why they're (8:11 - 8:16)
called Saint Bernard it's some (8:13 - 8:18)
Switzerland nonsense all right well you (8:16 - 8:20)
guys look that up I'll I'll give you the (8:18 - 8:23)
details here normally of the mullicer (8:20 - 8:26)
breeds which covers a wide range of dogs (8:23 - 8:29)
if you look at Wikipedia for Bernard it (8:26 - 8:31)
literally just says a French and West (8:29 - 8:33)
Germanic masculine given name also a (8:31 - 8:35)
surname and then links to a picture of (8:33 - 8:38)
you guessed it Saint Bernard which I (8:35 - 8:41)
assume the dog is named after so (8:38 - 8:45)
got it uh grieva uh grievard barely (8:41 - 8:47)
moves uh resting peacefully underground (8:45 - 8:49)
it pokes its topmost part of its head (8:47 - 8:52)
above ground and lights an eerie glow uh (8:49 - 8:55)
at its tip when then it waits for (8:52 - 8:57)
somebody to approach when a person draws (8:55 - 8:59)
near uh grivard jumps out of the ground (8:57 - 9:01)
and lets out a spooky cry that would (8:59 - 9:03)
startle most unsuspecting people though (9:01 - 9:05)
it doesn't appear to do this with ill (9:03 - 9:07)
intent it has a friendly and (9:05 - 9:10)
affectionate personality that uh playing (9:07 - 9:13)
even the slightest bit of attention will (9:10 - 9:14)
make it overjoyed and follow the trainer (9:13 - 9:16)
wherever they go of all the Pokemon (9:14 - 9:18)
residing in the paldeo region it's known (9:16 - 9:20)
to be especially easy to befriend (9:18 - 9:23)
however it will slowly uh absorb the (9:20 - 9:26)
life force of those around it so it's (9:23 - 9:28)
not best to play with it too much what (9:26 - 9:30)
what's more it is a power it has a (9:28 - 9:32)
powerful jaw that will shatter bones a (9:30 - 9:36)
single bite from uh grievard can be (9:32 - 9:38)
Grievous Grievous uh (9:36 - 9:40)
trainers are advised to approach it with (9:38 - 9:43)
caution I know it's Grievous because of (9:40 - 9:45)
Star Wars (9:43 - 9:47)
uh so it's believed to be based off of (9:45 - 9:50)
the briard dog which I sent a link to (9:47 - 9:51)
the Wikipedia so you can look at the (9:50 - 9:53)
picture let's see it because it has the (9:51 - 9:56)
the Shag over the eyes that is a typical (9:53 - 9:59)
this makes a lot more sense okay the (9:56 - 10:01)
belief is that that's where the last (9:59 - 10:04)
part of the name came from (10:01 - 10:06)
uh so grieving in the briard dog because (10:04 - 10:08)
they have this it also looks like (10:06 - 10:10)
Muttley from the old cartoons which is (10:08 - 10:11)
probably what I'm going to name mine (10:10 - 10:13)
when I take this on my journey because (10:11 - 10:15)
this is super cute this is also brought (10:13 - 10:18)
my official score for scarlet Violet two (10:15 - 10:21)
one out of ten because they added a dog (10:18 - 10:23)
was it currently zero yeah it's zero out (10:21 - 10:25)
of ten why (10:23 - 10:27)
like I don't have time to cover this I (10:25 - 10:30)
have time it's because his family to the (10:27 - 10:31)
last episode as I was driving back from (10:30 - 10:34)
a party last night and I heard nothing (10:31 - 10:36)
about a zero out of ten I just had your (10:34 - 10:38)
experience at the demo allowed to give (10:36 - 10:42)
my ratings according to Papa Nintendo I (10:38 - 10:44)
did yes that's true according to the (10:42 - 10:46)
Embargo we were not allowed to uh rate (10:44 - 10:49)
to the game on Sunday out of ten I had (10:46 - 10:50)
to uh cut it (10:49 - 10:52)
um you're gonna have to cut it now we're (10:50 - 10:55)
giving you extra work I'm sorry (10:52 - 10:55)
uh this I feel like okay so this is the (10:56 - 11:01)
20th Pokemon they've shown from uh (11:00 - 11:04)
scarlet and violet and uh you know there (11:01 - 11:06)
was there was the debate about Wiglet (11:04 - 11:09)
being a Diglett it ended up being a (11:06 - 11:11)
whole different Pokemon which totally (11:09 - 11:12)
fair right you know we had this (11:11 - 11:14)
conversation 12 years ago 10 years ago (11:12 - 11:16)
with bufalant and Tauros and stuff like (11:14 - 11:19)
this but with this Pokemon specifically (11:16 - 11:21)
uh people really hug on the fact that (11:19 - 11:25)
they just stuck a lit wick on its head I (11:21 - 11:26)
think it's kind of cute (11:25 - 11:30)
yeah uh I I don't know if I I don't know (11:26 - 11:32)
if that's my problem with the Pokemon I (11:30 - 11:35)
think I don't like its jaw it feels very (11:32 - 11:39)
Dreadnought to me it's very choppy (11:35 - 11:41)
um it's got a very choppy job but it's (11:39 - 11:42)
very cute it's a very cute choppy job (11:41 - 11:44)
because it smiles and then it opens its (11:42 - 11:45)
horrible mouth (11:44 - 11:47)
uh and then I saw a picture of the (11:45 - 11:50)
Luigi's Mansion dog polter pup and I was (11:47 - 11:52)
like man that's a better dog (11:50 - 11:54)
what how dare you (11:52 - 11:55)
that is (11:54 - 11:57)
factually incorrect if you look at (11:55 - 11:59)
anything in the Luigi's Mansion games (11:57 - 12:00)
that are the new Luigi's Mansion games (11:59 - 12:03)
the old original Luigi's Mansion had (12:00 - 12:04)
lots of Personality with the ghosts the (12:03 - 12:06)
polter pup and like all the new ghosts (12:04 - 12:09)
that are in the next level ones nah they (12:06 - 12:11)
are men compared to all the other ghosts (12:09 - 12:13)
in the original in the original Luigi's (12:11 - 12:15)
Mansion there were dead babies there (12:13 - 12:16)
were like rocking chair ghosts there (12:15 - 12:18)
were all these other weird things and (12:16 - 12:20)
now it's just like random generic ghost (12:18 - 12:23)
35 inside of a knight's outfit how could (12:20 - 12:26)
you say Poulter pup is a better pup it (12:23 - 12:28)
is literally just a blob with a collar (12:26 - 12:30)
on it (12:28 - 12:33)
would know that it's a dog is because (12:30 - 12:34)
the collar and you could also be (12:33 - 12:36)
convinced that it's a cat (12:34 - 12:39)
it's a weird amorphous blob that doesn't (12:36 - 12:41)
really look like any animal it's like (12:39 - 12:43)
somebody looked at Casper and said well (12:41 - 12:45)
what if I made it a dog well how do we (12:43 - 12:47)
do that we'll put a collar on it cool (12:45 - 12:49)
done I didn't know there's so it could (12:47 - 12:52)
be so much halter puff hate he also has (12:49 - 12:55)
it Poulter pup is a good name too is a (12:52 - 12:58)
good name that doesn't make a good art (12:55 - 13:02)
this dog with its cute candle under the (12:58 - 13:04)
ground love it (13:02 - 13:06)
smiley jaw that looks like a (13:04 - 13:08)
Jack-o-Lantern face plus it's probably (13:06 - 13:12)
going to get a bunch of bite moves (13:08 - 13:14)
Amanda on the topic on the topic of bike (13:12 - 13:16)
moves I will also say I know this (13:14 - 13:18)
thing's only Ghost type right it's mono (13:16 - 13:20)
Ghost type which was weird at first (13:18 - 13:21)
because you see the candle on it said (13:20 - 13:23)
you think Ghost Fire right you would (13:21 - 13:25)
think he has like a little liquid like (13:23 - 13:26)
you said on the top of his head and then (13:25 - 13:28)
he's gonna eventually have fire moves I (13:26 - 13:30)
actually think if this thing evolves I (13:28 - 13:32)
think it's going to be ghost dark (13:30 - 13:35)
because of what you said exactly which (13:32 - 13:36)
is that it seems like it's going to have (13:35 - 13:38)
a lot of bite moves and obviously bite (13:36 - 13:41)
and crunch are both dark type moves (13:38 - 13:42)
he'll probably end up getting firefang (13:41 - 13:45)
or the other Elemental fangs (13:42 - 13:48)
um I'm here for it but Steve I will say (13:45 - 13:50)
Reagan is right there with you when she (13:48 - 13:52)
first saw this dog she said it could (13:50 - 13:54)
have been cute but it has the ugly jaw (13:52 - 13:57)
and I don't like it now so you are not (13:54 - 13:58)
alone in saying you don't like the jaw (13:57 - 14:02)
people are all up on space helmet jaw (13:58 - 14:04)
giraffe and like that's the cutest thing (14:02 - 14:06)
ever and then this has a similar job (14:04 - 14:09)
that actually fits for a dog if it were (14:06 - 14:11)
like I like the job it's a space helmet (14:09 - 14:14)
that shuts and it grins evilly at people (14:11 - 14:17)
that's they put a giraffe into space (14:14 - 14:20)
and you have a dead dog that's got a (14:17 - 14:22)
Jack-o-Lantern themed mouth and you're (14:20 - 14:23)
like (14:22 - 14:26)
I'll take I'll take giant jaw ghost dogs (14:23 - 14:28)
over whatever arm erosion seller (14:26 - 14:31)
whatever its name is anyway (14:28 - 14:31)
not at all man yeah (14:32 - 14:37)
how dare you (14:34 - 14:40)
I I why did you bring this person on (14:37 - 14:42)
this is the worst episode we've ever had (14:40 - 14:45)
what you wait I didn't I've never heard (14:42 - 14:47)
you say you liked armor Rouge and (14:45 - 14:50)
through ledge Greg I think they're fine (14:47 - 14:52)
they're just not my style of Pokemon I (14:50 - 14:53)
agree they are not my style of Pokemon (14:52 - 14:56)
they look very Glade they too look too (14:53 - 14:58)
humanoid for me I think my favorites (14:56 - 15:00)
from this generation is I'm sure we're (14:58 - 15:02)
going to talk about are like the very (15:00 - 15:05)
non-humanoid classical looking kind of (15:02 - 15:07)
Pokemon so yeah armor Rouge very cool (15:05 - 15:09)
for people who like it just not my thing (15:07 - 15:11)
yeah (15:09 - 15:15)
yeah uh it's it's always funny that uh (15:11 - 15:17)
well here let's back up a second here (15:15 - 15:18)
because there's not a lot to talk about (15:17 - 15:20)
for the dog very disappointing so far I (15:18 - 15:22)
will say that the dog has pickup as an (15:20 - 15:25)
ability it makes sense uh but uh ball (15:22 - 15:28)
fetch was such a cool and such a great (15:25 - 15:29)
ability that yamper had they haven't (15:28 - 15:31)
given into a single Pokemon they show a (15:29 - 15:34)
new dog doesn't have ball fetch um (15:31 - 15:36)
hopefully yeah (15:34 - 15:38)
is coming back with ball fetch hopefully (15:36 - 15:40)
another Pokemon has ball fetch I feel (15:38 - 15:41)
like this would be a perfect Pokemon for (15:40 - 15:43)
ball fetch I think we're all in (15:41 - 15:45)
agreement that this thing is evolving (15:43 - 15:47)
um definitely yeah (15:45 - 15:50)
uh what I want to talk about though is (15:47 - 15:52)
like how they presented this Pokemon I (15:50 - 15:55)
feel like uh in in sword and shield they (15:52 - 15:57)
were like here's a 24-hour live stream (15:55 - 16:01)
of two Ponyta I hope you enjoy and this (15:57 - 16:03)
they're they've kind of been doing like (16:01 - 16:06)
these little I don't know almost like uh (16:03 - 16:08)
short form like like somebody at the (16:06 - 16:09)
Pokemon company discovered that Tick (16:08 - 16:11)
Tock was a thing and they're like hey (16:09 - 16:13)
let's let's do like a 30 second preview (16:11 - 16:15)
and then the next day we'll we'll tease (16:13 - 16:17)
it out uh and (16:15 - 16:20)
besides having us wake up at 8 A.M (16:17 - 16:23)
Central time or 6 a.m uh Pacific uh some (16:20 - 16:25)
of us have jobs and we're already awake (16:23 - 16:28)
so just because you sleep until 4 P.M (16:25 - 16:30)
every day does not mean it was a bad (16:28 - 16:34)
time I I I don't think anyone was happy (16:30 - 16:38)
waking up at 8am to have iono announce (16:34 - 16:39)
that she is having an announcement the (16:38 - 16:41)
next day (16:39 - 16:44)
a lot of people mad yeah and I'm I'm (16:41 - 16:45)
happy because I just I happen to be (16:44 - 16:47)
traveling so I didn't wake up I normally (16:45 - 16:49)
would I would do like a live stream or (16:47 - 16:51)
something and I was thrilled that I (16:49 - 16:53)
didn't and ever since then from now (16:51 - 16:56)
until this game gets released if they're (16:53 - 16:57)
like 6 a.m we're gonna show a new (16:56 - 16:59)
Pokemon I'm like I can wait I'm good but (16:57 - 17:01)
the weird thing is is people weren't (16:59 - 17:04)
that upset when we got that snow footage (17:01 - 17:06)
that didn't show anything and then two (17:04 - 17:08)
days later (17:06 - 17:11)
that was not at 8am they showed that (17:08 - 17:12)
during the day (17:11 - 17:16)
so people are like Mad at how dare you (17:12 - 17:18)
do this you're just mad at the time time (17:16 - 17:19)
and the problem is you're mad at (17:18 - 17:22)
yourself for because it was up all day (17:19 - 17:24)
you could have slept in and just watched (17:22 - 17:27)
it after but the fact that you decided (17:24 - 17:28)
to put the pressure on yourself to wake (17:27 - 17:30)
up at 8 A.M to watch a teaser trailer (17:28 - 17:33)
that is on you it's not their fault for (17:30 - 17:34)
doing a teaser trailer because I think (17:33 - 17:36)
it's 100 their fault they have a (17:34 - 17:38)
situation where they say hey wake up at (17:36 - 17:40)
8 A.M here's a 14 minute trailer hey (17:38 - 17:42)
wake up at 8 A.M here's a two minute (17:40 - 17:44)
trailer that doesn't announce that (17:42 - 17:45)
that's literally announcing another two (17:44 - 17:47)
minute trailer later this week (17:45 - 17:49)
setting expectations right a huge (17:47 - 17:51)
difference but yeah but they didn't they (17:49 - 17:54)
didn't put a whole lot of announcements (17:51 - 17:56)
between either like there's a lot of (17:54 - 17:58)
people deciding what it was going to be (17:56 - 18:00)
without them stating what it was going (17:58 - 18:02)
to be yeah I don't think anyone woke up (18:00 - 18:04)
being like oh great like she's (18:02 - 18:06)
announcing another announcement (18:04 - 18:10)
no but I I think like the rollout for (18:06 - 18:12)
these games and the way they are (18:10 - 18:14)
announcing things is definitely weird (18:12 - 18:16)
compared to the last few which is not (18:14 - 18:18)
necessarily a bad thing like I am very (18:16 - 18:20)
much in the camp that I want to go in (18:18 - 18:22)
with as little knowledge as possible (18:20 - 18:23)
Right like I'm happy they've only shown (18:22 - 18:25)
like what 20 Pokemon going into this one (18:23 - 18:28)
good it's an open world game I want to (18:25 - 18:29)
discover this stuff on my own on stream (18:28 - 18:31)
have my reactions see which you know (18:29 - 18:33)
which Pokemon I want to use that's great (18:31 - 18:36)
however I do think because there are (18:33 - 18:38)
fewer Pokemon that are being revealed (18:36 - 18:39)
and they're showing less because it is (18:38 - 18:41)
an open world game and I think they want (18:39 - 18:43)
more people to go into it like me then I (18:41 - 18:45)
think that this time around they're (18:43 - 18:46)
spreading out these announcements in a (18:45 - 18:47)
way that they normally would not be (18:46 - 18:49)
spreading out things you look back to (18:47 - 18:51)
like how alola was we were getting (18:49 - 18:54)
multiple alternate forms of Pokemon in (18:51 - 18:56)
the same trailer as like two new gym (18:54 - 18:57)
leaders and all these other characters (18:56 - 18:59)
and that really hasn't been the case for (18:57 - 19:02)
the last like four or five reveals if I (18:59 - 19:04)
recall correctly we had this one we had (19:02 - 19:07)
graphify we had draft rigs evolution and (19:04 - 19:09)
it was like one little bit of new (19:07 - 19:11)
information with other stuff and I think (19:09 - 19:13)
that's where people are getting upset I (19:11 - 19:15)
am also very much in the camp with Greg (19:13 - 19:17)
that like you don't have to wake up at (19:15 - 19:20)
6am to see this trailer you don't the (19:17 - 19:21)
people that this upsets which I (19:20 - 19:23)
completely understand are people like (19:21 - 19:25)
you and me Steve who are streaming this (19:23 - 19:27)
who are setting this up as our day (19:25 - 19:29)
because this is our job to be like what (19:27 - 19:31)
is this new Pokemon information we're (19:29 - 19:32)
going to be getting and then this is (19:31 - 19:33)
what we end up getting and we are then (19:32 - 19:36)
forced to create and turn out content (19:33 - 19:38)
based on a fun little teaser trailer of (19:36 - 19:40)
ionio talking who's probably not even (19:38 - 19:42)
gonna talk in the main game anyway like (19:40 - 19:44)
that's where people are getting upset (19:42 - 19:47)
right and I I don't think it is on the (19:44 - 19:48)
fault necessarily a Pokemon company (19:47 - 19:49)
because they're spreading it out the (19:48 - 19:52)
best way they can in terms of the (19:49 - 19:53)
information that they actually want to (19:52 - 19:55)
show pre-release I just wonder if (19:53 - 19:58)
instead of saying hey 8am every single (19:55 - 20:00)
time if they just drop it during the day (19:58 - 20:02)
uh or just or just don't even like or (20:00 - 20:05)
don't know there's no then people are (20:02 - 20:07)
gonna complain about you never know when (20:05 - 20:08)
these things are coming and I have a (20:07 - 20:09)
schedule to keep and I have to make (20:08 - 20:11)
content and you're dropping it in the (20:09 - 20:12)
middle of the day and I have to wake up (20:11 - 20:13)
this or ceremy's like it's the middle of (20:12 - 20:15)
the night for me because I'm asleep and (20:13 - 20:17)
you drop it or whatever as somebody who (20:15 - 20:19)
makes somebody who makes content I I (20:17 - 20:21)
don't I wouldn't get mad if a company (20:19 - 20:22)
just drops something (20:21 - 20:25)
like yeah but people do yeah sure will (20:22 - 20:26)
though for sure don't get mad but a (20:25 - 20:28)
million people do like you're mad at (20:26 - 20:29)
this one and a million people who are on (20:28 - 20:31)
the East Coast are like this was fine it (20:29 - 20:33)
was 9 A.M yeah people in England like it (20:31 - 20:36)
was 6 p.m for me it was perfect (20:33 - 20:40)
totally okay like your time zone (20:36 - 20:43)
creation is going to vary wildly (20:40 - 20:46)
yeah I I mean like I I think everything (20:43 - 20:49)
they're doing is bad I think the 24-hour (20:46 - 20:51)
thing would have been better if it (20:49 - 20:55)
wasn't so terribly boring yeah at the (20:51 - 20:57)
very end all we got was like one (20:55 - 20:59)
ponytail with the tail one ponytail (20:57 - 21:00)
without a tail and then it was like two (20:59 - 21:02)
weeks of people defending whether the (21:00 - 21:05)
tail was supposed to be there or not uh (21:02 - 21:06)
um (21:05 - 21:09)
it was like they had presented the 24 (21:06 - 21:12)
hours as a nature tune in the video and (21:09 - 21:14)
let it run in the background right and (21:12 - 21:17)
then everybody assumed it was going to (21:14 - 21:20)
be full of new Pokemon and it wasn't (21:17 - 21:22)
and people are like well I sat here and (21:20 - 21:25)
watched it for 24 hours like well or you (21:22 - 21:26)
could have done what I did is just let (21:25 - 21:29)
the 24 hours happen and then tune into (21:26 - 21:30)
the (21:29 - 21:32)
people who are like this is the one (21:30 - 21:33)
thing they showed I'm like cool thanks (21:32 - 21:34)
for doing that thank you for letting me (21:33 - 21:36)
know thank you for doing the job thank (21:34 - 21:38)
you for ruining your life when you could (21:36 - 21:40)
have done what I done and waited until (21:38 - 21:42)
the company said well this was in the 24 (21:40 - 21:45)
hours and put it on the web page after (21:42 - 21:47)
it was done yeah it was going to be on (21:45 - 21:50)
Serebii within five seconds (21:47 - 21:53)
I'll get an alert on Twitter new Pokemon (21:50 - 21:58)
showed at 24 23 in the trailer (21:53 - 22:01)
it doesn't have a tail yeah uh but yeah (21:58 - 22:03)
what Roger said was during the Sun and (22:01 - 22:04)
Moon era they were showing they were (22:03 - 22:07)
showing like five things a week yeah oh (22:04 - 22:09)
yeah you could go back to the that that (22:07 - 22:12)
uh that year and from the time they (22:09 - 22:14)
announced sun and moon it just felt like (22:12 - 22:16)
every single week they had something to (22:14 - 22:18)
show and it wasn't it was never one (22:16 - 22:20)
thing it was always two three four (22:18 - 22:23)
things also that Arrow was wild because (22:20 - 22:25)
like it's not so much the case now (22:23 - 22:28)
versus back then but like korokoro was (22:25 - 22:29)
still a thing right where things were (22:28 - 22:32)
dropping in korokoro before they were (22:29 - 22:34)
announced online so we would get (22:32 - 22:36)
official information like days before (22:34 - 22:38)
the company would even announce it and (22:36 - 22:40)
that was exciting I remember like (22:38 - 22:42)
looking up the scans on Twitter that (22:40 - 22:43)
people would post up and having this (22:42 - 22:44)
weird like fuzzy version of something (22:43 - 22:46)
that is official right we know it's (22:44 - 22:48)
gonna be real it's not like it's a fake (22:46 - 22:50)
leak and sitting there being like what (22:48 - 22:51)
the heck is this what's its ability I (22:50 - 22:53)
can't read Japanese somebody translate (22:51 - 22:54)
this and then there being all this (22:53 - 22:56)
information and this sort of news cycle (22:54 - 22:57)
for about three days of this exciting (22:56 - 23:00)
cool new thing and then you get the (22:57 - 23:02)
official reveal from Pokemon company and (23:00 - 23:03)
you get that exciting moment of seeing (23:02 - 23:05)
like the full reveal For the First Time (23:03 - 23:07)
The sugamori Art the ability all the (23:05 - 23:09)
information and it was like things (23:07 - 23:11)
lingered on for a little while longer (23:09 - 23:13)
whereas now like the conversation about (23:11 - 23:14)
grief art has kind of already ended (23:13 - 23:16)
right you saw it it's cute everyone's (23:14 - 23:18)
talked about it they moved on and (23:16 - 23:19)
they're ready for the next thing already (23:18 - 23:21)
and I kind of missed the days of like it (23:19 - 23:23)
being a three four day kind of news (23:21 - 23:25)
cycle (23:23 - 23:27)
yeah I think we had a little bit of that (23:25 - 23:29)
with the The Mouse and the parrot and (23:27 - 23:32)
the the weird salt Cube I do I love the (23:29 - 23:33)
little twin mice whatever those things (23:32 - 23:35)
are yeah I want to use them whether that (23:33 - 23:38)
or was attention intentional or not (23:35 - 23:39)
because it was it was in the English (23:38 - 23:40)
trailer it wasn't in the Japanese (23:39 - 23:44)
trailer I I can't imagine I mean (23:40 - 23:46)
can't imagine that they didn't watch (23:44 - 23:47)
that a million times before they hit (23:46 - 23:50)
publish but maybe they maybe they forgot (23:47 - 23:52)
I mean (23:50 - 23:55)
a pony tattoo (23:52 - 23:56)
things for a living that I send through (23:55 - 23:58)
quality check you would be surprised (23:56 - 24:00)
that even 15 people looking at it be (23:58 - 24:02)
like I never saw that (24:00 - 24:05)
now that reminds me like way back in the (24:02 - 24:06)
day of Super Smash Brothers Brawl there (24:05 - 24:08)
was like a brief trailer they showed (24:06 - 24:10)
this was prior to the game releasing (24:08 - 24:11)
right people were still trying to figure (24:10 - 24:14)
out what characters were in it and I in (24:11 - 24:15)
fact I'm pretty sure the Bulba cast (24:14 - 24:17)
episode I was talking about we talked (24:15 - 24:18)
about this exact thing I'm gonna bring (24:17 - 24:19)
up (24:18 - 24:22)
um which was in the trailer they showed (24:19 - 24:24)
a brief glimpse of like the stickers I (24:22 - 24:25)
don't know if you remember this but in (24:24 - 24:26)
Brawl there were like the little (24:25 - 24:27)
stickers you would put on the bottom of (24:26 - 24:29)
the trophies oh yeah and they would give (24:27 - 24:31)
different abilities and the stickers (24:29 - 24:33)
would tell you what Pokemon and trophies (24:31 - 24:35)
they would be compatible with to give (24:33 - 24:38)
you the best possible thing and if you (24:35 - 24:39)
watch this trailer there was a little (24:38 - 24:43)
very small head of Lucario in this (24:39 - 24:46)
trailer prior to us knowing Lucario was (24:43 - 24:48)
going to be playable and it was next to (24:46 - 24:50)
Pikachu and Jigglypuff and everyone was (24:48 - 24:51)
freaking out they're like oh my God (24:50 - 24:53)
Lucario is going to be a playable (24:51 - 24:55)
character and ball this is amazing and (24:53 - 24:56)
again that must have gone through so (24:55 - 24:57)
many different quality checks in (24:56 - 24:59)
Nintendo but it just happened to slip (24:57 - 25:01)
because somebody wasn't looking at the (24:59 - 25:02)
menu of the debug version that they took (25:01 - 25:05)
the footage from right yeah I would I (25:02 - 25:08)
would love to like that would be the (25:05 - 25:10)
Netflix documentary I'd want to watch is (25:08 - 25:12)
like who is working at these companies (25:10 - 25:14)
to be like yeah we purposely left that (25:12 - 25:16)
in to cause chaos right right like the (25:14 - 25:18)
hardcore fans (25:16 - 25:20)
um I would love to hear about that kind (25:18 - 25:21)
of stuff (25:20 - 25:22)
uh (25:21 - 25:25)
speaking of new stuff coming out uh (25:22 - 25:29)
zorark is in Pokemon unite and you know (25:25 - 25:30)
I thought this was gonna be a little bit (25:29 - 25:32)
of a short news article and then they (25:30 - 25:34)
decided to make zorark one of the most (25:32 - 25:36)
expensive characters (25:34 - 25:36)
only can you just not buy zorark you (25:38 - 25:44)
have to buy him with Ace premium skin (25:42 - 25:48)
and that stinks yeah it's bad (25:44 - 25:52)
it's really not great it's bad like I (25:48 - 25:56)
cannot believe it's 20 bucks yeah here (25:52 - 25:58)
let me let me just lay out the pricing (25:56 - 26:01)
here so zorark will be 14 000 AOS gems (25:58 - 26:02)
this is the new thing they've been doing (26:01 - 26:03)
with the last couple characters which (26:02 - 26:06)
you know when the game first came out 10 (26:03 - 26:07)
000 was was the cap uh and even (26:06 - 26:09)
Charizard was like I think he's only (26:08 - 26:11)
eight thousand he's he's not even the (26:09 - 26:15)
the most expensive uh so 8 000 EOS coins (26:11 - 26:17)
or sorry 14 000 as coins or (26:15 - 26:20)
575 EOS gems that's the paid only (26:17 - 26:22)
currency yeah zorark will only be (26:20 - 26:24)
obtainable with EOS gems as part of a (26:22 - 26:28)
Halloween bundle for 16 25 gems for the (26:24 - 26:30)
first seven days of a release which uh (26:28 - 26:32)
to translate to that to American money (26:30 - 26:35)
that is uh about twenty dollars so you (26:32 - 26:37)
don't have to buy this in the first (26:35 - 26:39)
seven days though right yeah you could (26:37 - 26:41)
just use your coins after the event runs (26:39 - 26:42)
out in your work is obviously always (26:41 - 26:44)
going to be part of the game now so (26:42 - 26:46)
right just wait because (26:44 - 26:50)
how much the coins are gonna be yeah (26:46 - 26:55)
because that also keeps increasing yeah (26:50 - 26:55)
it's hard to get coins but also the (26:55 - 26:59)
prices for (26:57 - 27:03)
for the Pokemon are going up like I (26:59 - 27:04)
haven't seen a new one released it's (27:03 - 27:07)
like here's 8 000 coins for this one (27:04 - 27:13)
like it's 10 12 14 18. like these are a (27:07 - 27:15)
lot of coins and I think it's because (27:13 - 27:16)
people are sitting on coins because (27:15 - 27:18)
there's literally nothing else to spend (27:16 - 27:21)
the coins on that anybody wants so they (27:18 - 27:23)
just keep ratcheting up the price to try (27:21 - 27:25)
to fix their economy (27:23 - 27:29)
um but I just don't know that zorark has (27:25 - 27:32)
the draw yet (27:29 - 27:35)
because it's yeah it's good in game but (27:32 - 27:37)
nobody (27:35 - 27:37)
I because it's so expensive I've (27:38 - 27:43)
of the ones I play because I play a lot (27:41 - 27:45)
and I play at least three matches every (27:43 - 27:49)
day I've been in a match with it once (27:45 - 27:53)
and I've been against it once in in the (27:49 - 27:54)
in the three or four days since it's (27:53 - 27:58)
been out whereas when Clefairy came out (27:54 - 28:01)
the game is lousy with clevery's list (27:58 - 28:04)
clefairy's everywhere (28:01 - 28:06)
there's just not a lot because I don't (28:04 - 28:09)
know that anybody really knows are you (28:06 - 28:11)
so are you do you think because zorark's (28:09 - 28:12)
not good or do you think it's because (28:11 - 28:14)
it's twenty dollars I think it's because (28:12 - 28:16)
it's twenty dollars yeah I I would agree (28:14 - 28:18)
that's probably the case what I've seen (28:16 - 28:21)
from how zorark plays or Arc is good (28:18 - 28:24)
although one art Gwen can argue if the (28:21 - 28:26)
illusion ability is actually doing its (28:24 - 28:28)
job (28:26 - 28:30)
um well isn't clefairy's ability just to (28:28 - 28:31)
pick a random unit (28:30 - 28:35)
yeah clevery's unite is terrible (28:31 - 28:37)
um but the rest of what Clefairy does is (28:35 - 28:39)
god-like yeah I was going to say (28:37 - 28:42)
clefable is one of those Pokemon that in (28:39 - 28:44)
every single game it's ever in it's (28:42 - 28:46)
always good yeah like it's good (28:44 - 28:48)
competitively it's good you do call (28:46 - 28:50)
mindset you could play it in unite you (28:48 - 28:51)
could play it in literally anything if (28:50 - 28:53)
Fable gets added to the game you know (28:51 - 28:56)
it's worth your money yeah it's I'm (28:53 - 28:57)
right there with you too with Zoroark (28:56 - 28:58)
because I play Pokemon unite all the (28:57 - 29:01)
time I normally use Talonflame but I (28:58 - 29:03)
guess like whenever they add the new (29:01 - 29:05)
Pokemon to the game it's never been that (29:03 - 29:07)
big of an issue for me because I I (29:05 - 29:10)
consider unite the same way I consider a (29:07 - 29:11)
lot of the other games that I play that (29:10 - 29:12)
have battle passes whether that's like (29:11 - 29:14)
multiverses whether that's OverWatch (29:12 - 29:17)
right like all of these games have (29:14 - 29:19)
battle passes now and paid content and a (29:17 - 29:21)
lot of it's like you get this character (29:19 - 29:22)
before anybody else can play this (29:21 - 29:24)
character and I'm like well I don't care (29:22 - 29:25)
like I don't know this character I'm (29:24 - 29:27)
good with Talonflame like I'm I'm good (29:25 - 29:29)
with junkrat like I don't you know what (29:27 - 29:31)
I mean like I don't need this new (29:29 - 29:32)
character right away I want to figure (29:31 - 29:33)
out if this character is going to be (29:32 - 29:35)
competitively viable before I plot down (29:33 - 29:37)
money on the thing anyway and by the (29:35 - 29:39)
time people have done their videos and (29:37 - 29:41)
done breakdowns then I'm aware of the (29:39 - 29:43)
fact that okay this thing is going to be (29:41 - 29:45)
good and by that point usually there's (29:43 - 29:46)
like some type of price cut on the (29:45 - 29:48)
character so this really kind of only (29:46 - 29:50)
affects the most hardcore of the (29:48 - 29:51)
hardcore the quote unquote like whales (29:50 - 29:53)
right who where there's a new character (29:51 - 29:55)
in a gotcha game they put the money down (29:53 - 29:57)
they want to get that character get it (29:55 - 29:58)
guaranteed I think the thing that's kind (29:57 - 30:00)
of scummy about this is tying it behind (29:58 - 30:02)
like a special skin or whatever that's (30:00 - 30:04)
the hollow air bundle right the hollow (30:02 - 30:06)
air bundle is bad that's awesome the (30:04 - 30:09)
other issue is that it seems zorark is (30:06 - 30:13)
shut down hard by clefable which is (30:09 - 30:16)
literally the most popular supporter the (30:13 - 30:18)
best supporter that's in the game right (30:16 - 30:21)
now yeah like clefable shuts down (30:18 - 30:24)
literally everything but when you (30:21 - 30:26)
released a new thing you've charged at (30:24 - 30:29)
this much money and its biggest counter (30:26 - 30:31)
is the most prevalent supporter in the (30:29 - 30:34)
game and clefable doesn't even need to (30:31 - 30:37)
level past six to literally shut down (30:34 - 30:39)
everybody's game like clefable doesn't (30:37 - 30:41)
even attack it just follows one person (30:39 - 30:43)
around and heals and puts down gravity (30:41 - 30:47)
wheels and you are dead for the rest of (30:43 - 30:48)
the game and zorark comes in it's like (30:47 - 30:50)
guess what the hard cutter for store (30:48 - 30:53)
work is the one thing that's winning (30:50 - 30:54)
games right now since they've once again (30:53 - 30:57)
nerfed Mr Mayan put Mr mime back in his (30:54 - 30:58)
place (30:57 - 30:59)
is I think everyone was happy with that (30:58 - 31:02)
Mr mime (30:59 - 31:04)
they need to hit Mr mime harder and Mew (31:02 - 31:06)
harder and I don't think anybody would (31:04 - 31:07)
be upset because those two things are (31:06 - 31:09)
absolutely like five Mr mine players are (31:07 - 31:12)
upset with the rest of the world thank (31:09 - 31:16)
you but yeah zorark feels like a weird (31:12 - 31:19)
it came at a weird time for a really bad (31:16 - 31:24)
price and unlike every like unlike every (31:19 - 31:25)
other new character where you see a lot (31:24 - 31:27)
of them the first day I have seen (31:25 - 31:31)
almost none and I think it's because it (31:27 - 31:32)
it's hard countered by the most popular (31:31 - 31:37)
supporter and it's so expensive yeah (31:32 - 31:40)
yeah I mean like really bad I'm kind of (31:37 - 31:41)
the same camp as Roger like there's a (31:40 - 31:43)
lot of Pokemon that they'll add that I I (31:41 - 31:45)
just know that are that's not not my (31:43 - 31:47)
play style I have zero interest in in (31:45 - 31:49)
dropping Gems or coins or anything like (31:47 - 31:51)
that or I'll wait maybe until it's on a (31:49 - 31:53)
discount I think the thing that at this (31:51 - 31:55)
point gets me excited like every time I (31:53 - 31:57)
add new hollowhere I'm like did they add (31:55 - 31:59)
new crime around Halloween no okay well (31:57 - 32:01)
like I I don't really care that much (31:59 - 32:04)
like like I know the meta is still in a (32:01 - 32:05)
weird place for that game (32:04 - 32:07)
um already and it sounds like clefable (32:05 - 32:09)
has made that even weirder (32:07 - 32:12)
um in a sense so like (32:09 - 32:14)
the the question I have is are they (32:12 - 32:15)
going to do that with future like when (32:14 - 32:16)
Sableye eventually comes out because we (32:15 - 32:18)
know Sable I is next are they going to (32:16 - 32:21)
attach a here's a 20 bundle for a skin (32:18 - 32:23)
that you probably won't like I think the (32:21 - 32:24)
Zoroark skin is bad by the way I don't (32:23 - 32:26)
think it's a great hollow wear I mean (32:24 - 32:31)
I've I've seen I have seen the leak of (32:26 - 32:34)
the Sableye skin (32:31 - 32:38)
I'm assuming based off of (32:34 - 32:40)
how they deserock it is going to be the (32:38 - 32:42)
same issue (32:40 - 32:45)
um I have like a bundle yeah I have a (32:42 - 32:47)
feeling because they did it here but (32:45 - 32:50)
the my question is is I don't know that (32:47 - 32:52)
this was a success for them (32:50 - 32:55)
so there is a slight chance in my heart (32:52 - 32:56)
that they won't bundle it because I (32:55 - 32:58)
don't think that this was a huge this I (32:56 - 33:00)
don't think this was a huge win for them (32:58 - 33:03)
yeah I don't think this was a big money (33:00 - 33:05)
seller except for the few people that (33:03 - 33:07)
did buy it (33:05 - 33:10)
but like I I guess I guess we don't know (33:07 - 33:12)
what the the translation to like whales (33:10 - 33:15)
to players are because like when the (33:12 - 33:17)
when the 40 nine tail skin came out (33:15 - 33:19)
people were like don't buy this can't (33:17 - 33:20)
believe they're charging forty dollars (33:19 - 33:23)
for it but like there has been many (33:20 - 33:26)
forty dollar skins since and and the (33:23 - 33:28)
game I always think of in the game I (33:26 - 33:29)
always bring up is like Apex Legends (33:28 - 33:32)
where you pay 20 for a gun skin or or (33:29 - 33:34)
forty dollars for us or not 40 but like (33:32 - 33:37)
I'm probably 20 for a skin there too and (33:34 - 33:38)
for three years people are like don't (33:37 - 33:41)
buy these skins but like they've never (33:38 - 33:43)
changed the prices no because they know (33:41 - 33:45)
because they're gonna spend money right (33:43 - 33:47)
which is like again again if people are (33:45 - 33:49)
gonna spend money they're gonna keep (33:47 - 33:50)
doing it they're gonna keep ratcheting (33:49 - 33:52)
up the prices it's going to continue to (33:50 - 33:53)
happen (33:52 - 33:55)
um I think it's it's just gonna take (33:53 - 33:57)
like one character kind of going back to (33:55 - 33:59)
what Greg was saying that everybody (33:57 - 34:01)
likes that universally from the get-go (33:59 - 34:04)
first day the people who do spend the (34:01 - 34:05)
money are like oh my God this (34:04 - 34:07)
character's kind of broken and everybody (34:05 - 34:09)
goes to download it and then it becomes (34:07 - 34:11)
like a greater issue but I think for the (34:09 - 34:12)
time being yeah like I'm certainly not (34:11 - 34:15)
clamoring for Zoroark now if this was (34:12 - 34:17)
sui and Zoroark I might have felt (34:15 - 34:18)
differently (34:17 - 34:20)
then maybe we would be having a (34:18 - 34:22)
different conversation but as it is (34:20 - 34:24)
right now yeah again I'm saving my money (34:22 - 34:26)
and when they have a you know discount (34:24 - 34:28)
EOS gen thing and I've got them built up (34:26 - 34:30)
then great I'll spend my money but until (34:28 - 34:33)
then I'm good the weird thing about the (34:30 - 34:37)
40 skins is (34:33 - 34:37)
as long as they've sold to they probably (34:37 - 34:43)
made their investment back because I (34:40 - 34:45)
will tell you those high priced skins I (34:43 - 34:48)
never see them in game (34:45 - 34:48)
all all those yeah (34:51 - 34:57)
like I play multiple matches every day (34:54 - 35:00)
and I do not see those expensive skins (34:57 - 35:02)
it's funny the way I consider it right (35:00 - 35:04)
whether it's again something like (35:02 - 35:07)
OverWatch or Pokemon is I think I (35:04 - 35:09)
probably would be one of the people who (35:07 - 35:10)
would have bought like a forty dollar (35:09 - 35:13)
skin if it was a really really cool like (35:10 - 35:15)
one-of-a-kind Talonflame skin right like (35:13 - 35:17)
I play Talonflame all the time the game (35:15 - 35:18)
is free right you could download Pokemon (35:17 - 35:20)
unite and play it for free I play for (35:18 - 35:23)
free all the time if they eventually (35:20 - 35:25)
released like a one-of-a-kind amazing (35:23 - 35:27)
skin for the one character that I play (35:25 - 35:29)
all the time in game I would probably (35:27 - 35:32)
feel like you know what I've put 60 70 (35:29 - 35:35)
80 hours into this game that normally I (35:32 - 35:38)
would buy a game for 50. and maybe play (35:35 - 35:39)
it for 15 hours and then be done with (35:38 - 35:41)
the whole campaign for me it's like okay (35:39 - 35:43)
well I've put enough hours into the game (35:41 - 35:46)
that I can justify myself spending forty (35:43 - 35:48)
dollars on this one thing that I really (35:46 - 35:51)
really want but again it's not the (35:48 - 35:52)
people like me they're concerned about (35:51 - 35:54)
it's the people that buy every skin that (35:52 - 35:57)
want to have everything in the game and (35:54 - 35:58)
for the people that play it at Worlds (35:57 - 35:59)
right I think it's the same situation (35:58 - 36:01)
they put thousands of hours into this to (35:59 - 36:03)
be on a world stage they're gonna put (36:01 - 36:07)
the 49 yeah I also have a strong feeling (36:03 - 36:09)
that they didn't pay for those skins (36:07 - 36:11)
that too yeah they probably got provided (36:09 - 36:14)
Pokemon (36:11 - 36:14)
the thought that they have all spent (36:16 - 36:21)
forty dollars on skins for a game that (36:19 - 36:23)
that the Skins don't matter because (36:21 - 36:25)
they're competitive there's no way they (36:23 - 36:27)
did not get gifted those games so they (36:25 - 36:30)
could be shown off so people like you (36:27 - 36:32)
could say well the people in the world (36:30 - 36:35)
make forty dollars to skip (36:32 - 36:37)
so apparently everybody else this is my (36:35 - 36:40)
forty dollar skin (36:37 - 36:43)
they had it they're winning with it (36:40 - 36:45)
um you know there there are there are (36:43 - 36:49)
there so in Apex Legends I I purchase (36:45 - 36:51)
every skin for my favorite character in (36:49 - 36:53)
that game well not purchase but like uh (36:51 - 36:54)
you you get currency in that game you (36:53 - 36:56)
can use the currency to unlock I think (36:54 - 36:57)
OverWatch has that too where you step up (36:56 - 36:59)
enough currency well not anymore (36:57 - 37:02)
it's the OverWatch 2 battle pass thing (36:59 - 37:04)
is like a whole other conversation but (37:02 - 37:07)
um so so for for uh for Apex that's (37:04 - 37:10)
that's crypto and I feel the same way in (37:07 - 37:12)
Pokemon unite like I like I'm coming (37:10 - 37:14)
back to the game because cramerant has a (37:12 - 37:16)
skin in this thing that you have to this (37:14 - 37:17)
cake thing you gotta do the cake thing (37:16 - 37:19)
you unlock the skin coming back cool (37:17 - 37:22)
um but I am sure that there are because (37:19 - 37:25)
before I would say before micro (37:22 - 37:27)
transactions existed (37:25 - 37:30)
if Pokemon unite was a 60 game and had (37:27 - 37:32)
no micro transactions I would be the (37:30 - 37:33)
person that would be like I'm going to (37:32 - 37:35)
unlock every skin for every character (37:33 - 37:38)
sure yeah it doesn't that doesn't exist (37:35 - 37:40)
because you need to do money well that (37:38 - 37:41)
does exist you just have to do it with (37:40 - 37:43)
money now but I am sure there are whales (37:41 - 37:46)
or players that they just purchase every (37:43 - 37:48)
song of course whether or not they (37:46 - 37:50)
played Zarina or not they're gonna buy (37:48 - 37:51)
this Arena skin and never play it they (37:50 - 37:55)
just want a complete collection (37:51 - 37:57)
um and so I think with these 40 skins (37:55 - 37:59)
I'm I'm sure they're hitting the Mark (37:57 - 38:02)
I'm sure there's a handful of people (37:59 - 38:04)
that are just I'm gonna buy every single (38:02 - 38:06)
update I'm gonna buy every clothing (38:04 - 38:09)
every scarf every shoe every skin (38:06 - 38:10)
um because again yeah it's a (38:09 - 38:12)
free-to-play game right like the the (38:10 - 38:15)
idea that you can download this and put (38:12 - 38:16)
this on your phone or on your switch or (38:15 - 38:19)
whatever and it's free initially makes (38:16 - 38:21)
the player base huge so literally if (38:19 - 38:25)
point zero one percent of people buy the (38:21 - 38:29)
40 skin they're making a ridiculous (38:25 - 38:32)
yeah (38:29 - 38:32)
yeah (38:32 - 38:34)
um okay last bit of news before we take (38:32 - 38:36)
a break uh they are officially coming (38:34 - 38:37)
out with the uh (38:36 - 38:41)
scarlet and violet cards here uh these (38:37 - 38:42)
are going to be available starting on (38:41 - 38:45)
January 6th so not this year (38:42 - 38:48)
um but the the first partner I think (38:45 - 38:50)
they're called the first partner paldea (38:48 - 38:53)
collection uh spigotito Fuego quaxley (38:50 - 38:55)
will join they'll come with the pins (38:53 - 38:58)
they'll come with oversized cards uh (38:55 - 38:59)
they will come with four booster packs (38:58 - 39:00)
so they they have in several booster (38:59 - 39:02)
packs they're gonna be I'm assuming (39:00 - 39:03)
they're probably going to be the last (39:02 - 39:05)
recent ones those like silver Tempest (39:03 - 39:09)
and uh lost Origins probably uh so four (39:05 - 39:12)
booster packs code card sprigatido Fuego (39:09 - 39:14)
quack sleep in uh oversized card (39:12 - 39:17)
featuring either Corydon ex or muridon (39:14 - 39:20)
ex which uh we don't even know what (39:17 - 39:21)
their types are (39:20 - 39:23)
they have to say that they're probably (39:21 - 39:25)
dragging in game but yeah you know you (39:23 - 39:27)
never know you look at solgaleo and (39:25 - 39:28)
you're like that should be a fire (39:27 - 39:30)
Pokemon Sun and stuff and it wasn't (39:28 - 39:31)
didn't end up being fired so who knows (39:30 - 39:33)
what the types are (39:31 - 39:33)
um (39:33 - 39:36)
so that'd be January 6th uh for those (39:33 - 39:37)
coming out (39:36 - 39:42)
um which is you know when anytime I read (39:37 - 39:44)
TCG news I just remembered that they (39:42 - 39:46)
announced Pokemon Trading Card Game Live (39:44 - 39:49)
last year it was supposed to come out in (39:46 - 39:50)
October (39:49 - 39:53)
it is now the end of October a year (39:50 - 39:57)
later and it's still not part of me is (39:53 - 39:59)
thinking they're doing that to wait (39:57 - 40:01)
until the launch of all this new stuff (39:59 - 40:02)
like the scarlet and violet things that (40:01 - 40:05)
they announced at Worlds this year like (40:02 - 40:06)
I mean that was a huge moment for me (40:05 - 40:09)
like I was somebody who I love the video (40:06 - 40:10)
games and I love the card game I like (40:09 - 40:12)
all the news but the thing that was most (40:10 - 40:14)
exciting to me at Worlds was not like (40:12 - 40:15)
cyclosor or whatever when they announced (40:14 - 40:17)
that during the Scarlet Violet thing it (40:15 - 40:20)
was bringing back ex because that was (40:17 - 40:22)
like around the time when I was growing (40:20 - 40:23)
up you had the e-reader stuff that was (40:22 - 40:25)
coming out they had introduced the ex (40:23 - 40:27)
things for the first time and I was (40:25 - 40:28)
stoked to be like all right now we're (40:27 - 40:30)
gonna get like mimic qex and all these (40:28 - 40:32)
other new forms the thing that weirds me (40:30 - 40:34)
out about this is like you said they're (40:32 - 40:35)
probably going to have the silver (40:34 - 40:38)
Tempest cards or whatever as part of (40:35 - 40:41)
these booster packs in these collections (40:38 - 40:44)
correct me if I'm wrong are those cards (40:41 - 40:46)
not going to be part of the new meta (40:44 - 40:48)
like with ex like are those going to be (40:46 - 40:50)
allowed even in game like in those decks (40:48 - 40:53)
or is this sort of going to be a (40:50 - 40:54)
complete new shift because it's going to (40:53 - 40:56)
be weird if you've got like these Vmax (40:54 - 40:59)
cards that are in silver Tempest that (40:56 - 41:01)
are in the same collection that now have (40:59 - 41:03)
EX cards which probably won't be the (41:01 - 41:05)
same meta when we're at Worlds next year (41:03 - 41:08)
in Yokohama uh a lot of Vmax cards will (41:05 - 41:09)
stop probably still be legal until (41:08 - 41:12)
August yeah really okay okay then okay (41:09 - 41:14)
um and then and then after August (41:12 - 41:16)
they'll probably cut most if not all (41:14 - 41:18)
Vmax I what what they normally do though (41:16 - 41:20)
when they switch this because they'll (41:18 - 41:23)
maybe like older older TCG players (41:20 - 41:24)
listening to the podcast will remember (41:23 - 41:26)
though they had Pokey bodies and Pokey (41:24 - 41:28)
abilities they just changed the word but (41:26 - 41:31)
the the word it in a way where like this (41:28 - 41:33)
blocks all Pokey bodies or this blocks (41:31 - 41:36)
all Pokey abilities they've done they've (41:33 - 41:38)
they've figured out how to word things (41:36 - 41:39)
so (41:38 - 41:42)
all they need to do with the paldeo set (41:39 - 41:45)
is like hey this Pokemon blocks all (41:42 - 41:46)
attacks from Vmax Pokemon and then (41:45 - 41:48)
people stop playing V-Max because it (41:46 - 41:52)
works yeah they they do really (41:48 - 41:55)
if if we give the Pokemon company credit (41:52 - 41:57)
for anything they're very good at like (41:55 - 42:00)
forcing you to buy a new car that's a (41:57 - 42:01)
new meta yeah (42:00 - 42:05)
so Silver's silver silver Tempest does (42:01 - 42:07)
come out in 12 days uh it's gonna (42:05 - 42:11)
feature over 190 cards they look amazing (42:07 - 42:12)
by the way I was seeing like some of the (42:11 - 42:14)
Full Art that's on Twitter of this (42:12 - 42:16)
there's the new Lugia card that's in (42:14 - 42:17)
there there's there there's like a (42:16 - 42:20)
Mewtwo one the Mewtwo V Star full art (42:17 - 42:22)
and the Charizard V-Star full art where (42:20 - 42:24)
it's Mewtwo and Charizard fighting each (42:22 - 42:25)
other but you see the different (42:24 - 42:27)
perspectives of the fight with the main (42:25 - 42:29)
Pokemon in the foreground it looks (42:27 - 42:32)
incredible yeah it's gonna be but I want (42:29 - 42:36)
those so badly so this is this is the (42:32 - 42:38)
last set for sword and shield before (42:36 - 42:40)
they rotate over into (42:38 - 42:44)
um the paldea stuff so uh exciting (42:40 - 42:45)
um although silver tap is a little big (42:44 - 42:49)
190 cards is is kind of a slog but (42:45 - 42:50)
um (42:49 - 42:52)
they I I personally think they've been (42:50 - 42:53)
doing a good job with the trainer (42:52 - 42:55)
Gallery stuff I I don't know if there's (42:53 - 42:56)
trainer gallery and silver Tempest I'm (42:55 - 42:58)
assuming there is I just have I haven't (42:56 - 42:59)
looked at the set list for it I feel (42:58 - 43:01)
like I have more fun with the TCG not (42:59 - 43:03)
looking up the set list but definitely (43:01 - 43:05)
yeah discovering something and going (43:03 - 43:06)
this could fit in one of my decks right (43:05 - 43:08)
now or this is like such a cool thing (43:06 - 43:10)
that I want to make a deck for it like I (43:08 - 43:12)
think when they uh they had the go set (43:10 - 43:14)
come out whatever that was like six (43:12 - 43:15)
months ago or something when go came out (43:14 - 43:18)
I didn't see the set list at all and I (43:15 - 43:19)
was opening packs on stream hashtag (43:18 - 43:21)
Pokemon partner or whatever I gotta get (43:19 - 43:23)
my FTC guideline together but I'm (43:21 - 43:26)
opening the packs on stream and Lunatone (43:23 - 43:28)
and soul Rock I saw for the first time (43:26 - 43:29)
in their abilities and I'm like man this (43:28 - 43:31)
card seems really really good so I made (43:29 - 43:33)
a deck for it come to find out like (43:31 - 43:35)
three weeks later when everyone has (43:33 - 43:37)
access to the cards like oh this is the (43:35 - 43:39)
meta if you want a good cheap budget (43:37 - 43:40)
deck that destroys things like dude (43:39 - 43:42)
Lunatone and soul Rock and so having (43:40 - 43:44)
those three weeks where I was kind of (43:42 - 43:45)
unaware that that was even going to be (43:44 - 43:47)
part of the new meta was really exciting (43:45 - 43:50)
to me yeah (43:47 - 43:51)
um (43:50 - 43:54)
so yeah silver silver Tempest November (43:51 - 43:56)
11th and then uh the paldea stuff (43:54 - 43:57)
January (43:56 - 44:02)
6. great for your dates uh I can't (43:57 - 44:04)
believe they didn't leak a Pokemon (44:02 - 44:06)
in these pictures of these cards missed (44:04 - 44:09)
opportunity (44:06 - 44:09)
I'm just looking at the back (44:09 - 44:13)
ground cards in this mock-up of the art (44:11 - 44:15)
and they could have at least slipped one (44:13 - 44:16)
they could have put like the mouse (44:15 - 44:18)
Pokemon on the card something to (44:16 - 44:20)
generate excitement in this press (44:18 - 44:21)
release instead it's just a bunch of (44:20 - 44:23)
cards that show me nothing (44:21 - 44:26)
yeah you know (44:23 - 44:28)
it's terrible uh I would like to get (44:26 - 44:31)
back into the TCG so hopefully the EX (44:28 - 44:34)
look maybe eventually right now (44:31 - 44:37)
they eventually launched that TCG live (44:34 - 44:40)
whenever that's coming I mean (44:37 - 44:44)
is that still only in Canada uh it is in (44:40 - 44:50)
Canada and Mexico and some other places (44:44 - 44:52)
look it's very easy to get into the Beta (44:50 - 44:54)
if you want to the problem is if you (44:52 - 44:58)
decide to move your (44:54 - 45:02)
ptcgo account into ptcg live you cannot (44:58 - 45:04)
go backwards so you are you are stuck (45:02 - 45:06)
there and then that separates the player (45:04 - 45:07)
base right because you have some players (45:06 - 45:10)
in ptgo and then you have some players (45:07 - 45:15)
in ptcg live and everything I think the (45:10 - 45:17)
actual serious players are still in PTC (45:15 - 45:18)
Geo (45:17 - 45:20)
so (45:18 - 45:22)
correct I don't want anything to (45:20 - 45:24)
transfer over I'm looking at the silver (45:22 - 45:26)
Tempest trainer gallery and there's two (45:24 - 45:27)
cards that you need to give me so oh (45:26 - 45:29)
yeah there's green Gallery stuff here (45:27 - 45:31)
yeah okay uh let's take a quick break (45:29 - 45:32)
and then we'll come back and we'll talk (45:31 - 45:33)
all about scarlet and violet and then (45:32 - 45:35)
we'll do our question of the week and (45:33 - 45:37)
we'll wrap up so we will be right back (45:35 - 45:41)
sounds good and we are back from our (45:37 - 45:45)
break all right so 20 20 Pokemon in uh (45:41 - 45:47)
we're less than a we're when this (45:45 - 45:50)
podcast goes up we'll be 17 days away (45:47 - 45:53)
from scarlet and violet what are your (45:50 - 45:55)
thoughts Roger are you excited uh (45:53 - 45:57)
scarlet and violet like in general yeah (45:55 - 45:58)
of course I'm excited what's the new (45:57 - 46:00)
Pokemon game like of course I don't (45:58 - 46:02)
think there's ever been in the history (46:00 - 46:04)
of a Mainline Pokemon game a game that I (46:02 - 46:06)
wasn't excited for I mean like I grew up (46:04 - 46:09)
with the series I like initially played (46:06 - 46:11)
the trading card game when I was in (46:09 - 46:12)
elementary school and then got into the (46:11 - 46:15)
video games and then got gifted My Game (46:12 - 46:18)
Boy Color special Pikachu edition 1999 (46:15 - 46:20)
Christmas with the little Jigglypuff and (46:18 - 46:22)
Togepi and Pikachu on it and I've (46:20 - 46:24)
literally been playing ever since I mean (46:22 - 46:26)
I can't wait and I think (46:24 - 46:27)
that this one too is like because it's (46:26 - 46:29)
open world I am super excited to stream (46:27 - 46:31)
it because I feel like instead of me (46:29 - 46:33)
just going through the storyline like I (46:31 - 46:34)
normally do this is content for months (46:33 - 46:37)
right this is me doing raids inviting (46:34 - 46:39)
other people on battling getting every (46:37 - 46:40)
single badge doing everything that I (46:39 - 46:42)
possibly can like trying to fill out the (46:40 - 46:44)
Pokedex I've been lucky with the past (46:42 - 46:46)
three I've actually completed the (46:44 - 46:48)
pokedexes for which was like unheard of (46:46 - 46:49)
when I was a little kid I think I did (46:48 - 46:52)
that for Gen 1 Gen 2 and then (46:49 - 46:54)
I think I ever did it again until like (46:52 - 46:56)
let's go Pikachu and then I've been (46:54 - 46:57)
doing it no no that's not true sun and (46:56 - 46:59)
moon alola I completed the Pokedex in (46:57 - 47:01)
Sun and Moon as well and then now I've (46:59 - 47:03)
been doing it ever since so I will (47:01 - 47:04)
probably continue that Trend with (47:03 - 47:06)
scarlet and violet depending on how many (47:04 - 47:08)
Pokemon are in the book yes for the for (47:06 - 47:10)
those maybe unfamiliar with your content (47:08 - 47:11)
uh what (47:10 - 47:13)
um what is what is your favorite (47:11 - 47:15)
generation of of game (47:13 - 47:19)
oh I'd say if you're including the remix (47:15 - 47:22)
I would say gen 4. just because Gen 4 (47:19 - 47:23)
was the first time you actually had (47:22 - 47:25)
Wi-Fi I still think to this day like in (47:23 - 47:27)
terms of any remake game for any (47:25 - 47:29)
franchise heart gold and soul silver is (47:27 - 47:32)
like my gold standard no pun intended I (47:29 - 47:33)
feel like those games did so many things (47:32 - 47:36)
right had so much extra content was so (47:33 - 47:38)
much fun to play and kind of everything (47:36 - 47:41)
from then on out in terms of remakes (47:38 - 47:43)
left me disappointed I'm somebody that (47:41 - 47:46)
was not a fan of Orris at all I was left (47:43 - 47:48)
severely underwhelmed by that game (47:46 - 47:49)
um and all the other like second (47:48 - 47:51)
versions of games since then I feel like (47:49 - 47:53)
ultrasound Ultra Moon wasn't quite (47:51 - 47:56)
different enough I loved the expansion (47:53 - 47:57)
pass stuff that was with uh sword and (47:56 - 48:00)
shield but like I don't know I think Gen (47:57 - 48:02)
4 there was just a special little (48:00 - 48:03)
element of je ne sais quoi that was in (48:02 - 48:05)
there with the Wi-Fi connection like (48:03 - 48:08)
having God as a Pokemon with Arceus and (48:05 - 48:11)
introducing I think that Legendary Trio (48:08 - 48:13)
of like Giratina Dialga Palkia was so (48:11 - 48:14)
cool (48:13 - 48:17)
um but if you're removing the remakes (48:14 - 48:19)
from it and I don't know if this is like (48:17 - 48:20)
a popular opinion on popular opinion (48:19 - 48:23)
whatever I would say my other favorite (48:20 - 48:27)
generation is Gen 5. I think Gen 5 is so (48:23 - 48:29)
cool I love the storyline with n I think (48:27 - 48:31)
those are games where in terms of the (48:29 - 48:33)
second game they did a lot of things (48:31 - 48:35)
different and that's kind of the gold (48:33 - 48:36)
standard for how I'd want a sequel game (48:35 - 48:38)
to be which is I think why I was (48:36 - 48:40)
disappointed with ultrasound and Ultra (48:38 - 48:41)
moon when it was like oh it's mostly the (48:40 - 48:43)
same game except for like the rocket (48:41 - 48:45)
stuff near the ending and the Mantine (48:43 - 48:47)
surfing whereas like black and white two (48:45 - 48:49)
are straight up different you have a (48:47 - 48:51)
totally new rival all these new areas (48:49 - 48:53)
it's like a sequel to the actual (48:51 - 48:56)
original game so different areas have (48:53 - 48:58)
changed like certain cities have grown (48:56 - 49:00)
some have fallen into ruin I just I love (48:58 - 49:02)
everything about black and white too so (49:00 - 49:05)
I'm gonna say overall Gen 5 is my answer (49:02 - 49:07)
for my favorite generation yeah black (49:05 - 49:09)
and white two are great I love those (49:07 - 49:12)
games love them hello (49:09 - 49:12)
what I don't think I still have never (49:13 - 49:16)
finished white two (49:15 - 49:19)
really (49:16 - 49:19)
and I think I have three-fourths of the (49:20 - 49:23)
way through white two and then I put it (49:21 - 49:26)
somewhere in my house (49:23 - 49:26)
and I don't know where that is (49:27 - 49:30)
where did I put that you you slightly (49:32 - 49:37)
mentioned that the DLC stuff of sword (49:35 - 49:38)
and shield so do you think that that you (49:37 - 49:40)
think that is the right direction or do (49:38 - 49:43)
you like to see like a platinum or uh no (49:40 - 49:47)
no okay I love Platinum I love Platinum (49:43 - 49:49)
Platinum is absolutely the definitive (49:47 - 49:51)
version of Gen 4 Emerald is the (49:49 - 49:53)
definitive version of gen 3 there is no (49:51 - 49:55)
argument those two games are superior (49:53 - 49:57)
but if we are getting things like (49:55 - 50:00)
ultrasun Ultra Moon if that's what those (49:57 - 50:02)
kind of games would be like in the (50:00 - 50:04)
future I don't want it I would much (50:02 - 50:06)
rather have DLC for a game that I (50:04 - 50:08)
already have that just adds a couple new (50:06 - 50:10)
things adds some new Pokemon add some (50:08 - 50:12)
new areas I don't have to buy a whole (50:10 - 50:13)
new game I can just buy the little (50:12 - 50:15)
expansion pass thing and I'm good (50:13 - 50:18)
um so long as there's enough content in (50:15 - 50:20)
the original version of the game that (50:18 - 50:21)
keeps me satisfied like I would hate it (50:20 - 50:24)
if they just decide okay well we know (50:21 - 50:25)
we're gonna do DLC so we're gonna keep (50:24 - 50:28)
this big extra portion just separate for (50:25 - 50:29)
this (50:28 - 50:30)
um and then have like a completely empty (50:29 - 50:33)
post game that I don't like I liked it (50:30 - 50:35)
at least to be some post game in the (50:33 - 50:38)
base game I am worried that DLC (50:35 - 50:41)
is replacing initial post game yes I (50:38 - 50:42)
agree (50:41 - 50:45)
I am worried that initial post game for (50:42 - 50:47)
scarlet and violet will just be (50:45 - 50:51)
competitive and there won't be any thing (50:47 - 50:54)
else until DLC because we kind of ran (50:51 - 50:55)
into that with (50:54 - 50:57)
uh sword and shield a little bit like (50:55 - 50:59)
there was some (50:57 - 51:03)
but not a lot and then you know we got (50:59 - 51:06)
two very good uh I mean one was better (51:03 - 51:08)
than the other but both were pretty good (51:06 - 51:12)
DLCs yeah and I'm I'm concerned that the (51:08 - 51:17)
lesson learned was that people will buy (51:12 - 51:19)
it and they don't have to focus on a (51:17 - 51:21)
post game to fill the Gap because people (51:19 - 51:23)
will come back for it (51:21 - 51:26)
um because that's tends to how be how (51:23 - 51:29)
companies do things yeah I mean that (51:26 - 51:30)
goes back to the interview where they (51:29 - 51:32)
were like no one played the Battle (51:30 - 51:34)
Frontier so we're not gonna do it in the (51:32 - 51:36)
future that's wild too considering like (51:34 - 51:40)
the core memories I have of emerald well (51:36 - 51:41)
and heart Coastal silver were playing (51:40 - 51:43)
the Battlefront yeah I loved that stuff (51:41 - 51:45)
everybody who loves Emerald loves the (51:43 - 51:49)
Battle Frontier sold less so it's like (51:45 - 51:52)
and you're assuming that everyone who (51:49 - 51:53)
bought it made it to the end of the game (51:52 - 51:56)
which is right not true Ludacris and (51:53 - 51:57)
also I'm sure it's sold less just (51:56 - 52:00)
because of gen 3. I mean you you look at (51:57 - 52:02)
that point in Pokemon history there was (52:00 - 52:05)
unequivocally sort of a lull right that (52:02 - 52:06)
was happening you saw it across the (52:05 - 52:08)
board you saw it with the TCG you saw it (52:06 - 52:09)
with the video games like I even (52:08 - 52:12)
remember being in school everybody being (52:09 - 52:14)
obsessed with Gen 1 and Gen 2 me being (52:12 - 52:16)
in like Middle School going into early (52:14 - 52:19)
High School playing gen 3 and nobody was (52:16 - 52:21)
really playing it and then come Gen 4 (52:19 - 52:23)
I'm kind of the I'd ran out until like (52:21 - 52:26)
DS really explodes and by like my junior (52:23 - 52:28)
senior year when everybody's playing at (52:26 - 52:30)
a DS then everybody was playing Gen 4 (52:28 - 52:32)
and couldn't wait for Gen 5 which then (52:30 - 52:34)
brought me to my college Years but I (52:32 - 52:37)
feel like gen 3 just because of a lot of (52:34 - 52:39)
different factors whether that's like (52:37 - 52:41)
the technology moving into like the (52:39 - 52:42)
Wi-Fi ERA with all the stuff that was (52:41 - 52:45)
happening in Gen 4 the the dip in (52:42 - 52:47)
popularity slightly there were a lot of (52:45 - 52:48)
different factors and I do not think (52:47 - 52:51)
them pinning the Battle Frontier as the (52:48 - 52:53)
reason why people didn't buy Emerald as (52:51 - 52:53)
much (52:53 - 52:57)
that's wrong it's one of those things (52:53 - 52:59)
where you always (52:57 - 53:03)
question why a corporation decides (52:59 - 53:05)
oh well we learned this lesson from that (53:03 - 53:08)
and I'm like was that the lesson you (53:05 - 53:10)
should have learned because most people (53:08 - 53:13)
who are very deep into those games were (53:10 - 53:15)
like that's not the lesson I would take (53:13 - 53:16)
away the lesson you needed to look at (53:15 - 53:19)
was your marketing around the age groups (53:16 - 53:22)
that you're going with because they all (53:19 - 53:25)
hit high school and you didn't have (53:22 - 53:28)
you you hadn't hit a generation yet yes (53:25 - 53:30)
like it's the Disney lull like they're (53:28 - 53:32)
just now beginning to understand the (53:30 - 53:35)
Disney alone like you'll see a dip in (53:32 - 53:38)
Disney movies for a while as they focus (53:35 - 53:40)
on the Marvel things because that is the (53:38 - 53:42)
bridge group and then suddenly we have (53:40 - 53:44)
princess movies coming back when there's (53:42 - 53:46)
10 year olds again like Disney (53:44 - 53:49)
understands the generational and how to (53:46 - 53:52)
Keep Their audience going that Nintendo (53:49 - 53:55)
particularly the Pokemon company only (53:52 - 53:59)
has just now figured out yeah you are as (53:55 - 54:00)
soon as you brought up the Disney (53:59 - 54:02)
comparison the the former Disney (54:00 - 54:04)
employee in me is like my heart was just (54:02 - 54:06)
warming because that's definitely that's (54:04 - 54:08)
it I mean that's exactly what it is (54:06 - 54:09)
right is that you had the Disney (54:08 - 54:11)
Renaissance when I was growing up go (54:09 - 54:13)
into like the Lilo and Stitch Treasure (54:11 - 54:15)
Planet kind of era where things lulled (54:13 - 54:18)
and then boom tangled frozen it all came (54:15 - 54:20)
back again and now people would argue (54:18 - 54:21)
it's sort of going back into another (54:20 - 54:22)
Valley and it's gonna pick back up again (54:21 - 54:25)
and these things move in waves they hit (54:22 - 54:28)
the you know they hit the Frozen market (54:25 - 54:30)
right that was the edge of that so now (54:28 - 54:33)
they're shifting to all superhero stuff (54:30 - 54:34)
because they're getting the teens and (54:33 - 54:36)
the young adults right and then those (54:34 - 54:38)
kids will make unfortunate decisions and (54:36 - 54:40)
have children of their own and then (54:38 - 54:42)
they'll be another slew of kids movies (54:40 - 54:44)
there you go in the meantime they plug (54:42 - 54:47)
it up with other products like Pixar (54:44 - 54:50)
makes movies that are very good at (54:47 - 54:52)
bridging both Generations yes right yes (54:50 - 54:55)
like Pixar has an adult reputation for (54:52 - 54:57)
kids movies so they rely on their other (54:55 - 55:00)
properties to plug in those holes yeah (54:57 - 55:02)
like Disney is uh like if you want to (55:00 - 55:04)
look at machines for as much as (55:02 - 55:08)
Pokemon's media Empire is a machine it (55:04 - 55:12)
pales in comparison to how well there's (55:08 - 55:14)
two there are two large entities out (55:12 - 55:16)
there that no Generations really really (55:14 - 55:19)
well one of them is Disney and the other (55:16 - 55:21)
is the Army and those two work (55:19 - 55:25)
Generations like nobody else does they (55:21 - 55:26)
understand (55:25 - 55:28)
how each generation ticks they (55:26 - 55:30)
understand what each generation needs (55:28 - 55:31)
and they understand how to Market (55:30 - 55:34)
specifically to those generations and (55:31 - 55:37)
it's really hard for people to be like (55:34 - 55:39)
well you know it just wasn't cool for (55:37 - 55:41)
Gen 3. it's like no it's because you (55:39 - 55:43)
were a teen and they didn't understand (55:41 - 55:45)
how to Market to you because the games (55:43 - 55:49)
didn't change yeah yeah at all nope they (55:45 - 55:50)
they're the same games and the same (55:49 - 55:52)
games that you're obsessed with now the (55:50 - 55:54)
formula existed you were just an angsty (55:52 - 55:56)
teen and they had no idea how to Market (55:54 - 55:59)
to you because they were new yeah and I (55:56 - 56:00)
think you you hit on something else that (55:59 - 56:02)
was interesting too which is that like (56:00 - 56:04)
there's kind of these games that bridge (56:02 - 56:07)
the gap and are in between I kind of (56:04 - 56:08)
feel like that's what they're trying to (56:07 - 56:10)
hit with Legends because I think Legends (56:08 - 56:12)
you're hitting on the Nostalgia but (56:10 - 56:14)
you're hitting it on an older (56:12 - 56:15)
demographic that wouldn't necessarily go (56:14 - 56:18)
back and like play a remake of like they (56:15 - 56:19)
wouldn't go back and play brilliant (56:18 - 56:20)
Diamond shining Pro with the cute little (56:19 - 56:22)
chibi art style right the same way a kid (56:20 - 56:24)
would but when they're like oh that's (56:22 - 56:25)
the generation that I remember and these (56:24 - 56:26)
are like the Pokemon that I remember but (56:25 - 56:28)
there's like this cool new story and (56:26 - 56:29)
it's open world you're getting those (56:28 - 56:32)
people into it so I I truly feel I don't (56:29 - 56:33)
know if you guys talked about it I'm (56:32 - 56:35)
sure you did Ad nauseam on the show and (56:33 - 56:36)
legends first came out earlier this year (56:35 - 56:38)
I think Legends is like one of the (56:36 - 56:40)
smartest things Pokemon company's done (56:38 - 56:42)
in years because that allows them to (56:40 - 56:44)
still remake the games for like you were (56:42 - 56:46)
saying Greg the people who are kids who (56:44 - 56:47)
are playing this stuff for the first (56:46 - 56:48)
time things like brilliant Diamond (56:47 - 56:50)
shining Pro whatever those games are not (56:48 - 56:52)
for us then you've got the Legends games (56:50 - 56:54)
which again bridge the gap and then the (56:52 - 56:56)
new generation that brings everybody in (56:54 - 56:59)
so yeah I I can't wait to see what they (56:56 - 57:00)
do whether it's like Legends of Nova or (56:59 - 57:02)
whatever yeah I look at the things like (57:00 - 57:06)
Pokemon Conquest and Mystery Dungeon as (57:02 - 57:08)
like their first attempts at like (57:06 - 57:10)
figuring out how to bridge that Gap yeah (57:08 - 57:13)
yeah because they are very (57:10 - 57:16)
they are more complicated than your base (57:13 - 57:19)
game and they are more series that were (57:16 - 57:22)
more popular with that teen to to 20 (57:19 - 57:25)
year old demographic in Japan so like (57:22 - 57:28)
you can see their first four race into (57:25 - 57:30)
it with those games and I think they've (57:28 - 57:32)
now just begun to figure it out like (57:30 - 57:36)
okay we are a generational product we we (57:32 - 57:38)
know we're a generational product now we (57:36 - 57:41)
understand that we can hit these things (57:38 - 57:41)
um (57:41 - 57:44)
you know Pokemon go carried the ball for (57:41 - 57:46)
us over the the last hurdle that you (57:44 - 57:49)
know that it brought it it plugged the (57:46 - 57:51)
hole perfectly for us but now yeah it's (57:49 - 57:54)
six years old and has come up in a retro (57:51 - 57:57)
list game on on my iPhone hey play retro (57:54 - 58:00)
games and Pokemon go is on there and (57:57 - 58:02)
that was just six years ago yeah that's (58:00 - 58:05)
not retro no Retro's ten so they got a (58:02 - 58:07)
couple more years to go still Brent sent (58:05 - 58:09)
it to me he's like what is this garbage (58:07 - 58:11)
on my phone and like it is six years old (58:09 - 58:13)
it's like there's no possible way that (58:11 - 58:15)
it was six years old I'm like again time (58:13 - 58:18)
doesn't exist for the last three years (58:15 - 58:21)
yep well I think the to go back to like (58:18 - 58:23)
hitting (58:21 - 58:25)
like knowing Their audience (58:23 - 58:28)
um and like understanding Their audience (58:25 - 58:30)
better if you if you look at scarlet and (58:28 - 58:32)
violet kind of one of the complaints is (58:30 - 58:35)
that we kind of now know that the the (58:32 - 58:38)
gyms don't scale appropriately right (58:35 - 58:40)
um and that you you know you'll go to (58:38 - 58:43)
brassius brassius would be 17 18 20 (58:40 - 58:45)
whatever his levels are (58:43 - 58:47)
um and then he will always be that so (58:45 - 58:48)
you can skip brassius you can go to (58:47 - 58:49)
somebody else you can go back to (58:48 - 58:50)
brassius he's still going to be the same (58:49 - 58:52)
level and you know there are some people (58:50 - 58:54)
that are upset about that there are some (58:52 - 58:55)
people that are in the camp that they (58:54 - 58:57)
don't really mind (58:55 - 58:59)
um but I I think the reason (58:57 - 59:02)
uh and the feeling I got from playing (58:59 - 59:04)
that game for an hour is is it's not (59:02 - 59:06)
really about satisfying those hardcore (59:04 - 59:08)
players of like I want every gym to be (59:06 - 59:10)
the correct level and I want to go to (59:08 - 59:12)
the Dragon Gym first and I want to go to (59:10 - 59:13)
the grass gym last but I want to make (59:12 - 59:14)
sure the grass gym is level 50 and the (59:13 - 59:17)
dragon Jim's little I think they (59:14 - 59:19)
understand that if they need to get old (59:17 - 59:21)
players back they need that classic (59:19 - 59:23)
experience (59:21 - 59:26)
um and the gym thing is the thing you (59:23 - 59:28)
just it is just the Classic experience (59:26 - 59:30)
where if somebody skips sun and moon (59:28 - 59:31)
somebody skips sword and shield they're (59:30 - 59:33)
coming back to an open world Pokemon (59:31 - 59:37)
game they still want a feeling of like (59:33 - 59:41)
I remember doing the gyms yeah and I and (59:37 - 59:43)
my takeaway from playing uh scarlet and (59:41 - 59:44)
violet was (59:43 - 59:47)
we keep the gyms classic but we have the (59:44 - 59:49)
team star stuff (59:47 - 59:53)
the the something totally different that (59:49 - 59:55)
you can also do in any order and we have (59:53 - 59:58)
the Titan stuff also something different (59:55 - 60:00)
that you can do in uh any order and the (59:58 - 60:01)
thing that stood out to me is when I (60:00 - 60:04)
fought that Titan cloth he didn't have a (60:01 - 60:06)
level and he doesn't have a level in the (60:04 - 60:08)
trailer and when I asked Nintendo I was (60:06 - 60:11)
like hey what's cloth's level and they (60:08 - 60:13)
were like oh Titan Pokemon don't have (60:11 - 60:15)
levels and I'm like oh maybe the Titan (60:13 - 60:18)
Pokemon are the ones that are scaling to (60:15 - 60:21)
be the difficult thing because you don't (60:18 - 60:23)
want everything to scale but you don't (60:21 - 60:26)
want nothing to scale so I think I think (60:23 - 60:28)
they understood that balance and and I (60:26 - 60:29)
think (60:28 - 60:31)
when you're when you're dramatically (60:29 - 60:33)
changing your game from (60:31 - 60:36)
not being open world for 25 years so now (60:33 - 60:38)
being open world you still need to have (60:36 - 60:41)
traditional elements to it (60:38 - 60:45)
um which uh which for better or worse I (60:41 - 60:47)
think is is the correct approach I think (60:45 - 60:49)
I think they are understanding that (60:47 - 60:52)
people are coming back to our games and (60:49 - 60:54)
not every Pokemon fan is playing every (60:52 - 60:56)
single Pokemon game people may be (60:54 - 60:57)
listening to this podcast they're (60:56 - 61:00)
playing every single Pokemon game but (60:57 - 61:02)
that's that's not 26 mil I wish we had (61:00 - 61:04)
26 million listeners but sword and (61:02 - 61:08)
shield sold 26 million copies and uh you (61:04 - 61:10)
know not all 26 million people completed (61:08 - 61:12)
the game not all 26 million people (61:10 - 61:14)
bought the DLC not all 26 people thought (61:12 - 61:16)
Pokemon was too hard not all 26 million (61:14 - 61:20)
people thought Pokemon was too easy like (61:16 - 61:20)
they're making a game to hit as many (61:20 - 61:25)
people as they want because they're a (61:24 - 61:26)
business and they want to sell as many (61:25 - 61:29)
people copies and like (61:26 - 61:31)
um I I don't I don't think (61:29 - 61:34)
I don't think level scaling the gyms is (61:31 - 61:37)
is the the answer to selling more copies (61:34 - 61:39)
or the like difficulty that people are (61:37 - 61:41)
really looking for (61:39 - 61:42)
um which puts me on a whole nother rant (61:41 - 61:45)
of like I don't think people really want (61:42 - 61:47)
difficult I think people want to be (61:45 - 61:50)
surprised like when and I think a really (61:47 - 61:52)
good example of that was Ultra necrozma (61:50 - 61:54)
and sun and moon you could beat alter (61:52 - 61:56)
necrozma you know maybe after your (61:54 - 61:58)
second try he's probably gonna single (61:56 - 61:59)
Sucker Punch from decidueye that's all (61:58 - 62:01)
it took for me every everybody talks (61:59 - 62:03)
about that Ultra necrozma fight that (62:01 - 62:04)
goes back to ultra sun and moon and I (62:03 - 62:06)
was like I don't even understand what (62:04 - 62:07)
people are talking about again maybe (62:06 - 62:09)
it's just because like who I started the (62:07 - 62:11)
game with but decidue why it was like (62:09 - 62:13)
one and done instantly I never even (62:11 - 62:15)
thought about it afterwards and then it (62:13 - 62:17)
became a topical conversation like after (62:15 - 62:18)
about a year everyone's like that Ultra (62:17 - 62:20)
narcosma fight wasn't that incredible (62:18 - 62:21)
I'm like bro what are you talking about (62:20 - 62:25)
yeah lying like so yeah like you said (62:21 - 62:28)
people have varying what the difficulty (62:25 - 62:30)
are exactly yeah like (62:28 - 62:31)
um (62:30 - 62:34)
like I I beat alternate cross mode with (62:31 - 62:35)
a level 14 basculine and it's just (62:34 - 62:37)
because you know I I understand how it (62:35 - 62:39)
works right I understand that like he's (62:37 - 62:41)
gonna go first I'm gonna have a focus (62:39 - 62:43)
sash I'm gonna like retaliate re-italia (62:41 - 62:45)
like you can do it a variety of ways (62:43 - 62:47)
right yeah that fight's not in (62:45 - 62:49)
particularly hard like there might be (62:47 - 62:51)
somebody listening it's like oh I lost (62:49 - 62:53)
like eight or nine times and like (62:51 - 62:55)
understandable like yeah you might not (62:53 - 62:57)
have the right Pokemon the right levels (62:55 - 62:59)
the understanding of type Effectiveness (62:57 - 63:01)
but like (62:59 - 63:04)
I don't no one wants to lose in a (63:01 - 63:06)
Pokemon match like 10 times in a row to (63:04 - 63:07)
like like you lose once and you're like (63:06 - 63:09)
ah he caught me off guard I think that's (63:07 - 63:10)
what people want they want that like (63:09 - 63:12)
surprise they want to be good they want (63:10 - 63:14)
Elden ring is what they want and (63:12 - 63:17)
realistically he is losing 17 times in a (63:14 - 63:18)
row until you finally figure out the (63:17 - 63:21)
pattern I mean that's that's dungeons I (63:18 - 63:23)
I (63:21 - 63:23)
disagree that that people don't want (63:24 - 63:29)
difficulty I think a bunch of people do (63:27 - 63:30)
like to be surprised but I do think (63:29 - 63:32)
there's a handy amount of people that (63:30 - 63:35)
like I want to be surprised and also (63:32 - 63:39)
have a tough puzzle to figure out like (63:35 - 63:41)
I think about the Mewtwo raids that were (63:39 - 63:43)
in sword and shield that was a tough (63:41 - 63:45)
puzzle to figure out but once everybody (63:43 - 63:47)
figured out the puzzle people were still (63:45 - 63:49)
were still doing them (63:47 - 63:51)
but so that puzzle was limitation of (63:49 - 63:53)
Pokemon like if you had more shadow (63:51 - 63:56)
that puzzle was significantly easier and (63:53 - 63:57)
there were just some people that I would (63:56 - 63:59)
queue up with and they wouldn't have (63:57 - 64:01)
good counter they wouldn't have like (63:59 - 64:03)
marshmallow but again that's that's also (64:01 - 64:05)
the difficulty of figuring out the (64:03 - 64:08)
puzzle but that's that that's MMO (64:05 - 64:11)
game design that's dungeon design that (64:08 - 64:14)
is it has a set pattern that you have to (64:11 - 64:15)
learn and then once you learn it you can (64:14 - 64:18)
execute that pattern that that is a (64:15 - 64:21)
difficulty level and it's it's different (64:18 - 64:23)
than surprise surprise is the initial (64:21 - 64:25)
thing that gets you excited the (64:23 - 64:27)
difficulty is figuring out the puzzle (64:25 - 64:30)
the problem is is that we've known the (64:27 - 64:31)
puzzle (64:30 - 64:35)
of Pokemon for 25 years right right like (64:31 - 64:37)
we know I puzzle it I still think (64:35 - 64:40)
alternate crossma is that big surprise (64:37 - 64:43)
though for sure what no for sure yeah I (64:40 - 64:44)
mean you hear people talk about oh I did (64:43 - 64:46)
that and I solved the puzzle and did it (64:44 - 64:47)
once it's not like people were like I'm (64:46 - 64:49)
going to keep re-queuing for alternate (64:47 - 64:52)
crossba 17 times because the drops are (64:49 - 64:53)
so good (64:52 - 64:56)
um but but like the going you could I I (64:53 - 64:59)
think I I and I had a huge argument with (64:56 - 65:00)
people on Twitch about this I think (64:59 - 65:02)
comparing Elden ring to Pokemon is (65:00 - 65:04)
completely fair and valid especially now (65:02 - 65:07)
uh especially now like somebody was like (65:04 - 65:09)
well Elden ring doesn't even have levels (65:07 - 65:09)
I was like what are you talking about (65:09 - 65:11)
like you could be level 40 in that game (65:09 - 65:13)
you could be level I think you could be (65:11 - 65:15)
160 in that game yeah like if you fight (65:13 - 65:17)
the moon girl with the feet I never (65:15 - 65:19)
remember her name she's like the second (65:17 - 65:23)
main boss right the library girl Library (65:19 - 65:24)
girl you can fight her in any order too (65:23 - 65:26)
like you know you can you can fight her (65:24 - 65:28)
at level 40. you can fight her at level (65:26 - 65:31)
100. obviously she's gonna be way easier (65:28 - 65:35)
you're at level 100 but also like if you (65:31 - 65:37)
struggle with that fight you can change (65:35 - 65:39)
your weapons you can you can bring (65:37 - 65:41)
different weapons you can equip (65:39 - 65:44)
different amulets you can most fights in (65:41 - 65:46)
Elgin ring even if you're you're you (65:44 - 65:50)
can't learn the pattern you can still (65:46 - 65:52)
brute force it through your potions (65:50 - 65:54)
which is like the same thing as Pokemon (65:52 - 65:57)
you can Brute Force fights with Max (65:54 - 66:00)
potions you can brute for you can go (65:57 - 66:02)
back and like if you're struggling with (66:00 - 66:06)
Blaine go catch six water Pokemon the (66:02 - 66:07)
game's not stopping you from doing that (66:06 - 66:09)
you don't have to go in with like a (66:07 - 66:14)
Venusaur or like like you have and maybe (66:09 - 66:17)
the games have to get to a but I don't I (66:14 - 66:19)
don't think the game should get to a (66:17 - 66:21)
point where you're struggling with a gym (66:19 - 66:22)
leader so much that you're like I need (66:21 - 66:25)
to redo my entire team like I I don't (66:22 - 66:28)
think people really want that (66:25 - 66:31)
um I think both of you are hitting on (66:28 - 66:33)
things that are important Greg I think (66:31 - 66:34)
like what you mentioned about people (66:33 - 66:36)
knowing the puzzle for 20 years is the (66:34 - 66:37)
difference compared to something like (66:36 - 66:40)
Elden ring or from soft game because all (66:37 - 66:41)
of these different mechanics are (66:40 - 66:43)
changing you've never experienced a (66:41 - 66:44)
character that hits you at this time (66:43 - 66:46)
your timing is different whereas like (66:44 - 66:47)
with Pokemon like you mentioned with (66:46 - 66:50)
alternate crosma fight like if you know (66:47 - 66:52)
the tech of focus Sash and Endeavor or (66:50 - 66:53)
retaliate or whatever like you can get (66:52 - 66:55)
through pretty much anything very (66:53 - 66:57)
quickly you could do like the type (66:55 - 66:59)
Effectiveness for the last 20 years has (66:57 - 67:01)
not changed like there's there's no (66:59 - 67:02)
difference there have been new types (67:01 - 67:05)
there's fairy now with like poison and (67:02 - 67:07)
steel but it's essentially the same (67:05 - 67:09)
thing nothing's really changing there I (67:07 - 67:11)
think going back to what I was saying at (67:09 - 67:12)
the beginning of this conversation with (67:11 - 67:14)
like my favorite generation something I (67:12 - 67:17)
think Gen 5 really succeeded at which I (67:14 - 67:19)
am shocked this has never been brought (67:17 - 67:22)
again ever since this got introduced was (67:19 - 67:24)
challenge mode that you beat the game (67:22 - 67:26)
for the first time and built into the (67:24 - 67:28)
game there's a thing where it's like you (67:26 - 67:29)
want to play again now you've unlocked (67:28 - 67:31)
hard mode play the whole game on a hard (67:29 - 67:33)
mode levels are higher everything's more (67:31 - 67:35)
difficult now I think if they brought (67:33 - 67:38)
that back into a Mainline Pokemon game a (67:35 - 67:39)
lot of these conversations about the (67:38 - 67:42)
game being too easy Exp share is forced (67:39 - 67:44)
like these would be removed to a certain (67:42 - 67:47)
extent whereas I think going to what (67:44 - 67:49)
you're saying Steve like you could play (67:47 - 67:51)
things out of order right like say for (67:49 - 67:54)
example there's a gym it's too difficult (67:51 - 67:55)
for you you want to go play a different (67:54 - 67:57)
gym fight go in the order that they're (67:55 - 67:59)
intending beat the dude who's like the (67:57 - 68:00)
grass gym leader at level nine Pokemon (67:59 - 68:02)
or whatever and you bring in your level (68:00 - 68:04)
30s and you're fine or you could go do (68:02 - 68:06)
other things and if what you're saying (68:04 - 68:08)
about the Titans is correct and there's (68:06 - 68:10)
no level to the Titans and those do (68:08 - 68:11)
scale and you could do those in any (68:10 - 68:14)
order that's great because then you (68:11 - 68:15)
could sort of fill out in between going (68:14 - 68:17)
to these different gyms with Titan (68:15 - 68:20)
battles or doing the team star areas and (68:17 - 68:22)
and that'll be your gameplay Loop until (68:20 - 68:25)
you get to the next gym leader you don't (68:22 - 68:27)
have to do them all in order but I think (68:25 - 68:29)
if the game is laid out in a way where (68:27 - 68:30)
it's like okay here's the first gym (68:29 - 68:32)
here's the second gen him and it's (68:30 - 68:33)
naturally pushing you in the direction (68:32 - 68:36)
of like this is the order to go in in (68:33 - 68:37)
itively people are going to go in that (68:36 - 68:39)
direction because the game was designed (68:37 - 68:41)
to be that and despite the fact that (68:39 - 68:42)
it's open world there is still a (68:41 - 68:44)
subsection of people that will do that (68:42 - 68:47)
and are not going to explore they want (68:44 - 68:49)
to experience the gyms in that order and (68:47 - 68:50)
then they'll do the Titan stuff and then (68:49 - 68:52)
they'll do the team star stuff (68:50 - 68:54)
um and that's I think that's the issue (68:52 - 68:55)
they're going to run into in terms of (68:54 - 68:57)
people actually putting these games in (68:55 - 68:59)
their hands is those players who haven't (68:57 - 69:01)
played for a while who know the gym (68:59 - 69:04)
mechanic but are used to the Team Rocket (69:01 - 69:07)
Dungeons and the the big Pokemon fights (69:04 - 69:09)
being naturally integrated into the (69:07 - 69:10)
story instead of things that you have to (69:09 - 69:12)
go and explore separately yeah and (69:10 - 69:14)
that's I think where the disconnect's (69:12 - 69:15)
gonna happen I mean I think also some (69:14 - 69:17)
people like the Elden ring thing works (69:15 - 69:19)
out to a point but the Elton ring and a (69:17 - 69:21)
lot of those other games like MMO stuff (69:19 - 69:24)
rely on your your skill they're not turn (69:21 - 69:27)
based like you can get quicker faster (69:24 - 69:30)
they aren't so heavily (69:27 - 69:32)
stuck and I think the thing that that's (69:30 - 69:35)
difficult to grasp in this game is how (69:32 - 69:38)
open the open world will be because (69:35 - 69:40)
every other game up to this point has (69:38 - 69:43)
gate kept the types of Pokemon you can (69:40 - 69:45)
get like you could only find certain (69:43 - 69:47)
things on these routes the wild area (69:45 - 69:49)
only has these certain Pokemon during (69:47 - 69:53)
these weather conditions and so it is (69:50 - 69:56)
more difficult to comprehend a world (69:53 - 69:59)
where you can leave that area and go (69:56 - 70:01)
find the ones that give you a type match (69:59 - 70:04)
up because we haven't had that and (70:01 - 70:06)
Pokemon isn't a game where your quick (70:04 - 70:10)
reaction skills or you're learning the (70:06 - 70:11)
pattern (70:10 - 70:14)
works as it does in things like Elden (70:11 - 70:16)
ring and MMOs it is you have to learn (70:14 - 70:18)
the types their moves and the counters (70:16 - 70:20)
and then make sure you have the Pokemon (70:18 - 70:22)
for those which have (70:20 - 70:24)
hopefully up until this game this game (70:22 - 70:27)
changes have been gate kept by their (70:24 - 70:30)
routes and what would they allow you to (70:27 - 70:33)
catch in those areas so the difficulty (70:30 - 70:35)
to make the jump to say that it's like (70:33 - 70:37)
Eldon ring is Elden ring is a skill (70:35 - 70:40)
based game MMOs are skill based games (70:37 - 70:43)
Pokemon is for sure a skill based game (70:40 - 70:46)
but but the PVE isn't that skill based (70:43 - 70:48)
levels still make a huge amount of it (70:46 - 70:52)
they still turn based and so there's a (70:48 - 70:56)
level of 25 years of get kept Pokemon (70:52 - 71:00)
and hard level caps where you a you have (70:56 - 71:02)
to over level which means grind that is (71:00 - 71:05)
that is difficult to grasp how this game (71:02 - 71:07)
will play out (71:05 - 71:10)
because I'm sure you guys would know (71:07 - 71:13)
um do the wild Pokemon scale so what (71:10 - 71:14)
Greg was talking about like could I go (71:13 - 71:16)
to the mountain area near the end of the (71:14 - 71:18)
game and like get a dragon immediately (71:16 - 71:21)
and then come back to you know gym one (71:18 - 71:23)
and then raise that dragon from the very (71:21 - 71:24)
beginning when normally I would have to (71:23 - 71:26)
like wait until after I beat the game to (71:24 - 71:28)
get a larvitary you know like uh I don't (71:26 - 71:30)
know because I play like obviously they (71:28 - 71:34)
they did a pre-built situation and my (71:30 - 71:36)
Pokemon were all level 25 and I had no (71:34 - 71:38)
gym badges and I ran into a level 40 (71:36 - 71:40)
Pokemon which was around a bunch of (71:38 - 71:44)
level like 20 Pokemon so twice the level (71:40 - 71:47)
sure sure I did it didn't prevent me (71:44 - 71:49)
from Catching it I just I I couldn't (71:47 - 71:50)
catch it because I didn't have the right (71:49 - 71:53)
type advantage to sure of course damage (71:50 - 71:55)
um so it wasn't stopping me from (71:53 - 71:57)
catching a level 40 with no gym badges (71:55 - 71:59)
uh but I didn't get to that point yeah (71:57 - 72:01)
and you want to go back with the Elder (71:59 - 72:03)
like obviously like Eldon like when when (72:01 - 72:05)
you buy Eldon ring you're buying a game (72:03 - 72:06)
that where everyone tells you you're (72:05 - 72:08)
gonna die a bunch like that that is part (72:06 - 72:10)
of its marketing right like when you're (72:08 - 72:11)
going to buy a Pokemon game and they're (72:10 - 72:13)
not going to be like oh boy brassius is (72:11 - 72:16)
gonna run you into the ground that's not (72:13 - 72:18)
part of the marketing but like (72:16 - 72:21)
in Elden ring if you are struggling you (72:18 - 72:23)
can over level like you you can go to (72:21 - 72:25)
specific level you can go to specific (72:23 - 72:27)
areas in that game and knock out the (72:25 - 72:28)
same enemy over and over and over and (72:27 - 72:33)
get you know 5 10 15 levels higher than (72:28 - 72:34)
you should be so like (72:33 - 72:37)
yeah Elden ring is like I I would I (72:34 - 72:39)
would I wouldn't say that Elder ring is (72:37 - 72:40)
more of a skill based game than Pokemon (72:39 - 72:43)
there's different skills one one is one (72:40 - 72:46)
is you know more thinking and planning (72:43 - 72:48)
out your turns and then the other one is (72:46 - 72:50)
more movement and dexterity but you can (72:48 - 72:53)
still Brute Force through both games you (72:50 - 72:54)
can still over level in both games to (72:53 - 72:57)
Brute Force if you don't understand the (72:54 - 73:00)
skills they're asking for you right yeah (72:57 - 73:02)
I mean I think that you know we bump up (73:00 - 73:05)
against the grind right like the balance (73:02 - 73:07)
of grind versus (73:05 - 73:10)
uh surprise versus difficulty like (73:07 - 73:14)
everybody wants something different and (73:10 - 73:16)
I think one of the things that is (73:14 - 73:18)
generally (73:16 - 73:20)
holding Pokemon back I think on some (73:18 - 73:22)
level is the fact that they are still (73:20 - 73:25)
turn based (73:22 - 73:25)
turn based changes a lot of that (73:26 - 73:32)
calculations to where people like if (73:28 - 73:33)
people feel they have more agency (73:32 - 73:35)
because they're not locked into a turn (73:33 - 73:39)
those defeats feel much more like I just (73:35 - 73:42)
haven't gotten my skills there or as a (73:39 - 73:44)
turn base still is I made the best (73:42 - 73:47)
decision I could on my turn (73:44 - 73:49)
and I didn't have it I don't have a (73:47 - 73:52)
chance in the turn to compensate for it (73:49 - 73:54)
yes I have to wait till my turn comes up (73:52 - 73:57)
and turn base is a limiting factor to (73:54 - 74:00)
these games as far as difficulty as far (73:57 - 74:03)
as surprise as far as people's agencies (74:00 - 74:07)
in the game like the hope is that the (74:03 - 74:09)
raids will fix that somewhat like that (74:07 - 74:13)
the not having turns in raids is done in (74:09 - 74:15)
a way that's super fun and people are (74:13 - 74:17)
like okay well I get that sense from (74:15 - 74:19)
these other things but I do think at (74:17 - 74:21)
this point compared to other modern (74:19 - 74:22)
games (74:21 - 74:24)
you're just not going to get the same (74:22 - 74:27)
level of satisfaction from difficulty (74:24 - 74:31)
from a turn-based game that you are in (74:27 - 74:34)
free combat free movement free decisions (74:31 - 74:36)
like if you had if you had the ability (74:34 - 74:39)
to say Dodge in the middle of (74:36 - 74:40)
Something's turn like is it timing (74:39 - 74:43)
button to hit the Dodge or you get x (74:40 - 74:44)
amount of dodges something do help you (74:43 - 74:46)
do something during while you're waiting (74:44 - 74:49)
for the program to play out it's a very (74:46 - 74:51)
different feel and I don't know that (74:49 - 74:53)
we'll ever get that with Pokemon games (74:51 - 74:55)
but either like the Mario and Luigi (74:53 - 74:57)
games that have like the built-in Dodges (74:55 - 74:59)
and stuff (74:57 - 75:02)
um the the role-playing Mario the RPG (74:59 - 75:05)
Mario sure yeah I think that there's (75:02 - 75:08)
just a level of (75:05 - 75:11)
coming to terms with this is a (75:08 - 75:13)
term-based game and turn-based games (75:11 - 75:15)
have set limitations (75:13 - 75:16)
a turn-based game that has set (75:15 - 75:19)
limitations that a child can play right (75:16 - 75:20)
I think that's the other thing too is (75:19 - 75:22)
that that's all so many people want (75:20 - 75:24)
right right so many people want it to be (75:22 - 75:26)
a super difficult RPG kind of experience (75:24 - 75:29)
but again like going back to that Disney (75:26 - 75:32)
comparison man you want to get the youth (75:29 - 75:34)
into playing this game like a child is (75:32 - 75:36)
not I mean some might but like a kid's (75:34 - 75:38)
not gonna sit there and play Elden ring (75:36 - 75:39)
and you're not expecting some (75:38 - 75:40)
eight-year-old to be able to beat Elder (75:39 - 75:42)
and you are expecting an eight-year-old (75:40 - 75:46)
if they're playing through Pokemon (75:42 - 75:46)
yeah exactly fortnite is more like Leon (75:46 - 75:51)
to be able to beat Leon right like that (75:49 - 75:54)
should be a easy enough feat for an (75:51 - 75:56)
eight-year-old and they're not they're (75:54 - 75:57)
designing the game with that in mind (75:56 - 75:59)
which is why I get it goes back to the (75:57 - 76:02)
thing with Gen 5 like all you need to do (75:59 - 76:04)
is to have something once you've beaten (76:02 - 76:06)
the game once right to have some (76:04 - 76:08)
additional difficulty feature unlock I (76:06 - 76:10)
think you see this all the time with (76:08 - 76:12)
people who are like I've beaten the game (76:10 - 76:13)
now I'm gonna do a Nuzlocke run now I'm (76:12 - 76:15)
gonna do whatever to some mix that (76:13 - 76:17)
people will do like randomizers or (76:15 - 76:19)
whatever things that they want to do to (76:17 - 76:21)
like have these self-imposed rules to (76:19 - 76:23)
make the games more difficult whereas if (76:21 - 76:24)
that was something that was built into (76:23 - 76:27)
the game already this wouldn't even be a (76:24 - 76:29)
conversation if that was something post (76:27 - 76:32)
game that all Pokemon games said here is (76:29 - 76:33)
like the difficulty mode here is (76:32 - 76:36)
whatever our Nuzlocke would be but it's (76:33 - 76:38)
actually something designed for the game (76:36 - 76:40)
that is built in that you're meant to (76:38 - 76:41)
play that way as a harder difficulty (76:40 - 76:44)
level people would do it you would see (76:41 - 76:45)
all these content creators that are (76:44 - 76:47)
getting in trouble for doing like (76:45 - 76:49)
randomizers or whatever they would not (76:47 - 76:50)
be getting in trouble anymore because (76:49 - 76:51)
they would be playing the thing that (76:50 - 76:53)
Pokemon has put in the game to make it a (76:51 - 76:55)
higher difficulty level to immediately (76:53 - 76:58)
make more content so anyway it's almost (76:55 - 76:59)
like a self-imposed restriction on (76:58 - 77:01)
themselves you know yeah I mean I don't (76:59 - 77:03)
I I don't I didn't I I went through all (77:01 - 77:06)
of challenge mode uh in black 2i2 I (77:03 - 77:08)
didn't find it to be harder personally (77:06 - 77:11)
really but but I mean like I also (77:08 - 77:13)
understand the rules of Pokemon like I (77:11 - 77:14)
mean like chair and getting one extra (77:13 - 77:16)
Pokemon on and then every other gym (77:14 - 77:17)
leader getting one extra Pokemon yeah (77:16 - 77:20)
the all the gym leaders having I think I (77:17 - 77:21)
think what challenge mode did is it (77:20 - 77:22)
increased all the trainers and all the (77:21 - 77:24)
gym leaders like plus three levels I (77:22 - 77:25)
think it was either plus two or plus (77:24 - 77:26)
three but all the time leaders got one (77:25 - 77:28)
extra Pokemon (77:26 - 77:31)
um and I think I think they they had at (77:28 - 77:34)
least like two if not higher perfect IVs (77:31 - 77:36)
on their Pokemon as well (77:34 - 77:38)
um I didn't personally find that to be (77:36 - 77:40)
harder right like if I if I'm going (77:38 - 77:45)
against uh Marlin uh who's the like the (77:40 - 77:48)
eighth the water guy like I'm gonna use (77:45 - 77:50)
Thunderbolt every single time like (77:48 - 77:51)
there's it doesn't matter if you have (77:50 - 77:52)
four Pokemon or five Pokemon I'm still (77:51 - 77:54)
gonna hit the Thunderbolt button (77:52 - 77:56)
um but don't you think that to some (77:54 - 77:59)
extent if they said okay you beat the (77:56 - 78:02)
game and they like literally develop (77:59 - 78:03)
into the game a thing where you go okay (78:02 - 78:06)
I'm in this new region I'm only allowed (78:03 - 78:08)
to catch one Pokemon right you're only (78:06 - 78:10)
allowed to catch the first Pokemon that (78:08 - 78:12)
shows up on that route and that's built (78:10 - 78:14)
into the game that's not a thing like (78:12 - 78:15)
that the players self-imposing on (78:14 - 78:17)
themselves that's the thing and then (78:15 - 78:19)
when that Pokemon you can't fight with (78:17 - 78:20)
that Pokemon anymore obviously Pokemon (78:19 - 78:21)
company's never going to be like well (78:20 - 78:23)
that Pokemon died you can't use it (78:21 - 78:26)
anymore but to the extent of like the (78:23 - 78:27)
Pokemon is too tired and needs to go (78:26 - 78:29)
recover into the box you can't use this (78:27 - 78:32)
Pokemon anymore like they could easily (78:29 - 78:34)
find a way to do that that makes sense (78:32 - 78:37)
within the Canon the vocabulary oh they (78:34 - 78:38)
could but they don't need to they don't (78:37 - 78:39)
need to waste the time on that I agree (78:38 - 78:41)
they don't need to they don't need to (78:39 - 78:43)
waste the time but if you want to appeal (78:41 - 78:45)
to that demographic and you want to (78:43 - 78:47)
appeal to the people that like that (78:45 - 78:49)
that's what you have to do (78:47 - 78:51)
your thing I didn't talk about earlier (78:49 - 78:54)
too it's like it's not made for everyone (78:51 - 78:56)
to be able to beat it it's made for the (78:54 - 78:59)
people who want a challenge and that's a (78:56 - 79:01)
choice of the Pokemon company to say hey (78:59 - 79:03)
look we're going to develop this and (79:01 - 79:04)
give you a challenge or we're not going (79:03 - 79:05)
to worry about this we're going to (79:04 - 79:08)
implement scaling or do other things to (79:05 - 79:10)
make people play it in their own way and (79:08 - 79:12)
then the the player can decide their own (79:10 - 79:14)
self-imposed rules to play this (79:12 - 79:15)
separately but again until they (79:14 - 79:17)
Implement that into the game in a way (79:15 - 79:19)
that's actually in the development of (79:17 - 79:21)
the title this kind of thing's always (79:19 - 79:23)
going to happen yeah it's weird that new (79:21 - 79:25)
game plus has been part of Final Fantasy (79:23 - 79:27)
forever yeah and it's only ever in Final (79:25 - 79:30)
Fantasy games (79:27 - 79:33)
I think a lot of games do hard mode very (79:30 - 79:37)
poorly uh like like when like Halo is a (79:33 - 79:39)
good example Halo is just give the (79:37 - 79:41)
enemies more Health give you less Health (79:39 - 79:43)
like yeah like making things bullet (79:41 - 79:45)
sponges isn't like the answer I'm (79:43 - 79:46)
looking for I don't think it's an answer (79:45 - 79:48)
a lot of people are looking for I think (79:46 - 79:50)
a game that does like difficulty well (79:48 - 79:51)
that doesn't have like a hard mode or (79:50 - 79:54)
easy mode is like Mario games like in (79:51 - 79:57)
Super Mario 64 or Mario Galaxy or Mario (79:54 - 79:59)
Super Mario Sunshine there were always (79:57 - 80:01)
levels that were significantly harder (79:59 - 80:03)
than other levels (80:01 - 80:05)
um like uh in in sunshine they would (80:03 - 80:07)
take away your jetpack and you'd be so (80:05 - 80:09)
accustomed to it you're like oh well now (80:07 - 80:10)
I don't have like that thing to save me (80:09 - 80:12)
if I accidentally jump the wrong way (80:10 - 80:16)
right uh or you know in in even even in (80:12 - 80:18)
like breath of the wild there were (80:16 - 80:20)
dungeons I went into and I was like I'm (80:18 - 80:22)
too dumb to solve this puzzle (80:20 - 80:23)
um but it's okay because like in both (80:22 - 80:25)
Mario games and Zelda games you don't (80:23 - 80:27)
have to solve every single puzzle to do (80:25 - 80:29)
so like I wouldn't want the Pokemon (80:27 - 80:31)
company to be like okay here's a (80:29 - 80:32)
built-in like (80:31 - 80:34)
Nuzlocke mode because you can just do (80:32 - 80:37)
that yourself right I I would want areas (80:34 - 80:41)
of the game to be harder uh like I would (80:37 - 80:42)
want them to go back to building like a (80:41 - 80:44)
Battle Frontier or something where it's (80:42 - 80:48)
like like you you can beat the whole (80:44 - 80:50)
game it's fine defeat Leon your champion (80:48 - 80:53)
of Galler now but here's here's an (80:50 - 80:56)
actual difficult thing that you can do (80:53 - 81:00)
um that isn't like yeah I just don't (80:56 - 81:03)
think them wasting time on like a (81:00 - 81:05)
built-in Nuzlocke is is ever going to (81:03 - 81:06)
like satisfy those people because (81:05 - 81:07)
they're still going to have complaints (81:06 - 81:10)
but I I think the idea of like oh they'd (81:07 - 81:12)
be wasting development time doing this (81:10 - 81:13)
no they wouldn't you literally type a (81:12 - 81:15)
rule and develop like it's not because (81:13 - 81:16)
they literally don't like it'd be (81:15 - 81:18)
different if this was if this was (81:16 - 81:19)
something where they're building out new (81:18 - 81:21)
areas right that does take development (81:19 - 81:24)
time but self-imposing a rule in the (81:21 - 81:26)
game literally just saying okay at this (81:24 - 81:28)
portion you cannot catch another Pokemon (81:26 - 81:30)
you cannot do this thing would there be (81:28 - 81:31)
instances in which that would be kind of (81:30 - 81:33)
broken sure right that a player might (81:31 - 81:35)
get stuck with one thing and they need (81:33 - 81:37)
to restart from the beginning but when (81:35 - 81:39)
the player is signing up to do that (81:37 - 81:40)
optional mode within the game it (81:39 - 81:42)
wouldn't be an issue because they know (81:40 - 81:43)
what they're signing up for like I think (81:42 - 81:45)
the development thing would definitely (81:43 - 81:47)
be an issue if they are developing (81:45 - 81:48)
something like a Battle Frontier or a (81:47 - 81:50)
new area which then goes back to their (81:48 - 81:51)
comments of like well this was something (81:50 - 81:53)
that not a lot of people played so we're (81:51 - 81:55)
not going to put the dev time into doing (81:53 - 81:57)
it but putting a rule in there is it's (81:55 - 81:59)
not something that would take all this (81:57 - 82:01)
extra development time that's a (81:59 - 82:03)
relatively simple thing to implement (82:01 - 82:05)
obviously everything takes Dev time but (82:03 - 82:08)
it would not be anywhere near the amount (82:05 - 82:09)
of time they would spend on making some (82:08 - 82:11)
type of new area and I think you would (82:09 - 82:14)
be able to satisfy a demographic of (82:11 - 82:16)
people that are always looking for more (82:14 - 82:18)
of a challenge in a much easier way and (82:16 - 82:19)
then spend the rest of your time (82:18 - 82:21)
polishing that core game that (82:19 - 82:23)
everybody's going to enjoy (82:21 - 82:26)
not to take over but one last thing I (82:23 - 82:28)
want to say is like on the topic of (82:26 - 82:30)
games that do difficulty well I think (82:28 - 82:33)
Arceus did it really well like I think (82:30 - 82:36)
going through to that Volo fight that (82:33 - 82:37)
was a legitimate challenge for somebody (82:36 - 82:39)
who's been playing Pokemon for 20 years (82:37 - 82:41)
when the Cynthia music kicks in again (82:39 - 82:43)
and you're battling Volo at the end of (82:41 - 82:45)
Arceus and he whips out the Giratina (82:43 - 82:47)
that then goes like spoiler spoiler oh (82:45 - 82:49)
spoiler okay (82:47 - 82:51)
I'm like this game has been out for a (82:49 - 82:53)
long enough time it's fine but he whips (82:51 - 82:55)
out the Giratina and then the Giratina (82:53 - 82:57)
changes form and you can't kill and you (82:55 - 82:59)
can't you know have the full full (82:57 - 83:01)
restore after that first fight and the (82:59 - 83:02)
Garrett time to fight now you're in this (83:01 - 83:05)
third fight like that was awesome right (83:02 - 83:06)
like and I think that even goes beyond (83:05 - 83:08)
the genuine surprise thing that we're (83:06 - 83:09)
talking about that's funny because I had (83:08 - 83:10)
such an easy time with that fight (83:09 - 83:12)
because right yeah I had weird deer so (83:10 - 83:14)
he couldn't touch me weird oh so that (83:12 - 83:16)
okay so that goes back to maybe what you (83:14 - 83:17)
were talking about then with that the (83:16 - 83:19)
difficulty is kind of different forever (83:17 - 83:21)
but I I had some newer people in my (83:19 - 83:23)
twitch chat they called me they said I (83:21 - 83:25)
cheated during that fight because I used (83:23 - 83:28)
a normal type Pokemon bro come on yeah (83:25 - 83:30)
no no no no no no no that's your luckier (83:28 - 83:32)
draw you had a weird deer and that's (83:30 - 83:35)
great you know yeah I mean like yeah I I (83:32 - 83:37)
and that's funny that's funny that we've (83:35 - 83:39)
come full circle of like me saying like (83:37 - 83:41)
the ultra necrosma was like oh it threw (83:39 - 83:43)
me off and you said oh you just sucker (83:41 - 83:44)
punched it and then you say you struggle (83:43 - 83:46)
threw me off yeah and then I was like oh (83:44 - 83:48)
I had a weird deer and I had uh uh (83:46 - 83:50)
ursuluna both normal type Pokemon so (83:48 - 83:51)
even if the weird ear died I had another (83:50 - 83:53)
normal type Pokemon and exactly really (83:51 - 83:57)
touch it it's like it's really hard to (83:53 - 83:59)
and I think this is why people go back (83:57 - 84:02)
to nuzlocks or randomizers is because (83:59 - 84:05)
you're restricting the Pokemon you have (84:02 - 84:08)
access to right like I like I I kind of (84:05 - 84:10)
figured you know you haven't seen Gary (84:08 - 84:12)
like I I did catch weird deer and I did (84:10 - 84:13)
catch or Saloon and I did use those the (84:12 - 84:15)
entire time but as I started playing for (84:13 - 84:17)
the game I was like oh I'm gonna put two (84:15 - 84:18)
and two together that this dude's gonna (84:17 - 84:19)
have like gertina like of course where (84:18 - 84:21)
else is Giratina going to be well so I (84:19 - 84:22)
have no reason to remove these Pokemon (84:21 - 84:25)
but I do like those two Pokemon (84:22 - 84:27)
um but you know when you're doing like a (84:25 - 84:29)
randomizer and you know your only your (84:27 - 84:31)
first Pokemon you catch is a grass and (84:29 - 84:34)
the first gym is a fire like yeah it's (84:31 - 84:37)
hard but you you don't need a randomizer (84:34 - 84:38)
to do that I mean if you go to Brock and (84:37 - 84:40)
you bring a Charmander you're gonna have (84:38 - 84:41)
a harder time (84:40 - 84:44)
um it but it it the whole conversation (84:41 - 84:46)
revolves around like that fight was (84:44 - 84:47)
super hard for you it was really easy (84:46 - 84:49)
for me but we just had different Pokemon (84:47 - 84:51)
exactly (84:49 - 84:53)
um and you can do that for yourself in (84:51 - 84:55)
scarlet and violet right like you can go (84:53 - 84:58)
to brassius with three Pokemon you can (84:55 - 84:59)
go to them with six Pokemon you can go (84:58 - 85:01)
to them with one Pokemon you can go to (84:59 - 85:02)
them with a I don't know if weedle's in (85:01 - 85:04)
the game but I'm going to assume if (85:02 - 85:05)
weedle's in the game and you go to (85:04 - 85:06)
brassius weave Weedle you're probably (85:05 - 85:08)
gonna have a tough time versus if you go (85:06 - 85:11)
to brassius with you know Foy Coco (85:08 - 85:13)
that's true (85:11 - 85:15)
I do think like the puzzle part of this (85:13 - 85:18)
is the terrestrializing (85:15 - 85:20)
like I think that's how they're trying (85:18 - 85:22)
to get surprised in each gym is that you (85:20 - 85:23)
don't know what they're going to (85:22 - 85:26)
trastialize into sure they've hinted at (85:23 - 85:29)
it with uh brassy as his gym although (85:26 - 85:31)
you could guess that he's gonna dress (85:29 - 85:34)
like a rock to grass right uh it doesn't (85:31 - 85:37)
help your gym but I I think that's I (85:34 - 85:38)
think that's part of what they're going (85:37 - 85:41)
for with the surprise and upping the (85:38 - 85:43)
difficulty a little I just think it's (85:41 - 85:44)
it's (85:43 - 85:46)
everybody's version of what difficult (85:44 - 85:48)
means (85:46 - 85:51)
is (85:48 - 85:54)
wildly different right and right I don't (85:51 - 85:55)
think (85:54 - 86:00)
I think we come down to the point of (85:55 - 86:02)
at some point (86:00 - 86:05)
you have to accept the games for what (86:02 - 86:06)
they are (86:05 - 86:09)
and if it's not serving your needs (86:06 - 86:10)
anymore (86:09 - 86:13)
maybe it's not maybe it's not where you (86:10 - 86:16)
want to be like like temtem exists to (86:13 - 86:18)
deal with what people didn't like about (86:16 - 86:21)
Pokemon right like true other things (86:18 - 86:23)
have popped into take place of people (86:21 - 86:27)
saying I no longer find satisfaction in (86:23 - 86:30)
this type of game style sure so now I'm (86:27 - 86:32)
going to go with something else like (86:30 - 86:35)
temtem uses a stamina thing and you can (86:32 - 86:37)
instead of running out of moves you can (86:35 - 86:38)
hurt yourself and that's part of the (86:37 - 86:40)
strategy and blah blah blah blah like (86:38 - 86:42)
all the things that it fixes for Pokemon (86:40 - 86:45)
like there's a million games that fix (86:42 - 86:47)
that they didn't like in this other game (86:45 - 86:49)
yeah and (86:47 - 86:53)
we want Pokemon to evolve right like we (86:49 - 86:55)
want it and we've seen it starting to (86:53 - 86:58)
evolve but it's never going to like (86:55 - 87:00)
Final Fantasy is never going to be (86:58 - 87:03)
beyond what its final fantasy roots are (87:00 - 87:05)
right like at some point they did (87:03 - 87:08)
abandon turn based (87:05 - 87:10)
but the formulas pretty much always stay (87:08 - 87:11)
the same like if you don't want (87:10 - 87:13)
Summoners if you don't want these (87:11 - 87:15)
abilities this isn't the game for you (87:13 - 87:17)
like if you don't want the same spells (87:15 - 87:19)
being in every game like I'm tired of (87:17 - 87:22)
always using life I'm tired of always (87:19 - 87:24)
using hiraga I'm always tired of using (87:22 - 87:26)
fire Rocka these are not the games for (87:24 - 87:29)
you anymore like right right like (87:26 - 87:30)
Dungeons and Dragons has had the same (87:29 - 87:33)
spell list for almost 50 years now like (87:30 - 87:35)
these are not necessarily the games for (87:33 - 87:38)
you if you're over that (87:35 - 87:40)
if you're over what they offer you (87:38 - 87:42)
you're fine to be like I love those (87:40 - 87:45)
games they no longer meet my needs and I (87:42 - 87:47)
think the difficulty we have with fans (87:45 - 87:50)
who talk about a lot more difficulty I (87:47 - 87:53)
want XYZ they're asking for things that (87:50 - 87:54)
will never (87:53 - 87:58)
that aren't something possible in those (87:54 - 87:59)
games that's not something that they (87:58 - 88:01)
have stated that they have wished to do (87:59 - 88:04)
like they are not against fan used (88:01 - 88:06)
get like they're not against that idea (88:04 - 88:09)
but the reason why you're never going to (88:06 - 88:10)
see Nuzlocke rules is because they never (88:09 - 88:13)
they didn't develop them they are easily (88:10 - 88:15)
pointable to a person that created those (88:13 - 88:17)
rules who owns those rules whose things (88:15 - 88:20)
you can still find it's not some they (88:17 - 88:22)
can't put you can't put fan made things (88:20 - 88:25)
in your official products without paying (88:22 - 88:28)
the fan though I'm gonna make an (88:25 - 88:30)
argument against that that because I was (88:28 - 88:33)
in the trenches when this happened (88:30 - 88:37)
free-for-alls were a thing during X and (88:33 - 88:40)
Y and going into all this other stuff (88:37 - 88:42)
during that era free-for-alls became (88:40 - 88:44)
very popular on YouTube and then what (88:42 - 88:46)
happened going into sun and moon where (88:44 - 88:47)
you had the four players against each (88:46 - 88:49)
other like the Battle Royale yeah but (88:47 - 88:51)
bro there's there's like a clear-cut (88:49 - 88:54)
correlation between free-for-alls being (88:51 - 88:56)
a thing on YouTube into battle royale (88:54 - 88:58)
and regardless they'll never admit that (88:56 - 89:00)
that's where it was but you could also (88:58 - 89:02)
easily point to free-for-alls exist in a (89:00 - 89:04)
million other areas of course but I (89:02 - 89:06)
think are you loaned by another person (89:04 - 89:09)
like capitalizing either was Nuzlocke to (89:06 - 89:11)
be fair I think Nuzlocke has sort of (89:09 - 89:14)
evolved into a way where it's now its (89:11 - 89:16)
own sort of like side thing where people (89:14 - 89:18)
will do it on YouTube nice thing but the (89:16 - 89:20)
name and the concept is still exists on (89:18 - 89:22)
the internet the person that created (89:20 - 89:25)
that real set and named it well you (89:22 - 89:27)
exist oh okay oh yeah we're talking (89:25 - 89:29)
about two different things then I'm not (89:27 - 89:31)
saying make a quote unquote official (89:29 - 89:35)
Nuzlocke mode obviously call it (89:31 - 89:35)
when it mirrors something that exists (89:35 - 89:40)
that has been a part of the community (89:39 - 89:43)
for that long there is no way around (89:40 - 89:45)
pointing it back to the person that did (89:43 - 89:47)
it like free Falls free Falls existed in (89:45 - 89:49)
wrestling free-for-alls existed on (89:47 - 89:51)
football (89:49 - 89:54)
played in Pokemon where there's double (89:51 - 89:56)
battles and the people on the same side (89:54 - 89:59)
are attacking each other like that type (89:56 - 90:01)
of thing I totally agree like we're we (89:59 - 90:02)
are in agreement in terms of the reason (90:01 - 90:03)
they're not probably not going to do (90:02 - 90:06)
Nuzlocke stuff is because there's (90:03 - 90:07)
obviously someone you could point to and (90:06 - 90:09)
say this is where it all started but (90:07 - 90:11)
again you can't kind of do that with (90:09 - 90:12)
free-for-alls there were like three or (90:11 - 90:14)
four YouTubers that started doing (90:12 - 90:17)
free-for-alls that got real popular and (90:14 - 90:19)
if you just do Pokemon X and Y free for (90:17 - 90:22)
all most recent whatever and you scroll (90:19 - 90:24)
down to all this video you can pinpoint (90:22 - 90:26)
where that starts oh yeah pretty easily (90:24 - 90:28)
yeah yeah but I think the thing that (90:26 - 90:29)
people like talk about those things (90:28 - 90:33)
don't realize is if it's something that (90:29 - 90:36)
that somebody has made yes and it can (90:33 - 90:38)
clearly points to those people like it (90:36 - 90:40)
does like those people didn't make up a (90:38 - 90:43)
free-for-all idea they capitalized on it (90:40 - 90:46)
right like we can't say (90:43 - 90:48)
I don't know (90:46 - 90:50)
a drive made free-for-alls they created (90:48 - 90:53)
a free-for-all rule set sure you can't (90:50 - 90:55)
point to that person so of course if (90:53 - 90:57)
it's popular and it doesn't belong to (90:55 - 91:00)
anybody they can co-opt it (90:57 - 91:04)
but if it clearly belongs to somebody (91:00 - 91:07)
and nuzlocke's clearly do it's also like (91:04 - 91:09)
the drama over Nintendo saying they (91:07 - 91:12)
don't like nezlocks well right you you (91:09 - 91:14)
can't do a Nuzlocke on an official (91:12 - 91:17)
Channel like right you can't efficiently (91:14 - 91:18)
give (91:17 - 91:21)
somebody's playing a little bit good (91:18 - 91:23)
because yeah that's exactly what it was (91:21 - 91:24)
right is that (91:23 - 91:26)
fun like those of us who do Pokemon (91:24 - 91:29)
partner stuff we can do nuzlocks we just (91:26 - 91:30)
can't do randomizers like you can play (91:29 - 91:33)
it let's lock your phone like if you're (91:30 - 91:34)
if you're playing a Nuzlocke the way (91:33 - 91:36)
that it's built out where you know you (91:34 - 91:37)
only do one Pokemon one route you're not (91:36 - 91:39)
altering the game code in any way they (91:37 - 91:40)
have no issue with that right like at (91:39 - 91:43)
all it's that like you said you're (91:40 - 91:46)
pinpointing it exactly kitten Crystal (91:43 - 91:48)
worked for Nintendo on the official (91:46 - 91:51)
Nintendo account so obviously they were (91:48 - 91:52)
gonna be like no right don't do it (91:51 - 91:54)
Nuzlocke like right eventually because (91:52 - 91:57)
it's on the official Creator they don't (91:54 - 92:01)
care like yeah exactly and like (91:57 - 92:01)
about that conversation was it wasn't (92:04 - 92:10)
that the fact that they worked in a very (92:08 - 92:13)
toxic environment and like talking about (92:10 - 92:15)
the toxicity of being a corporate (92:13 - 92:18)
Creator and what bringing ideas were (92:15 - 92:19)
like like that was the important (92:18 - 92:22)
conversation to have like being official (92:19 - 92:24)
content creator for official Corporation (92:22 - 92:26)
is a toxic environment and a lot of (92:24 - 92:29)
people do it and live in these toxins (92:26 - 92:31)
instead everybody went off on this (92:29 - 92:34)
completely stupid enough Nintendo hates (92:31 - 92:36)
nuzlocks and things are like hacking I'm (92:34 - 92:37)
like true yeah that's not the (92:36 - 92:38)
conversation you should be having (92:37 - 92:40)
Nintendo needs to be held accountable (92:38 - 92:43)
for creating a very toxic relationship (92:40 - 92:46)
with content creators but instead going (92:43 - 92:48)
back to what you are talking about they (92:46 - 92:50)
think Nuzlocke is hacking and I'm like (92:48 - 92:53)
no again it's it's the way things were (92:50 - 92:55)
worded and like out of context because (92:53 - 92:56)
kitten Crystal were saying exactly what (92:55 - 92:59)
you're saying it wasn't like talking (92:56 - 93:01)
about this thing that is allowed it's (92:59 - 93:04)
the way it got taken away yeah and then (93:01 - 93:06)
regurgitated online and stuff yeah it's (93:04 - 93:08)
like things just get shifted (93:06 - 93:11)
like me and Sarah be like both tweeted (93:08 - 93:13)
the same thing hey we recently talked to (93:11 - 93:15)
the Pokemon company Nintendo they said (93:13 - 93:16)
it was cool no big deal and then like (93:15 - 93:19)
people were like what was the source uh (93:16 - 93:23)
Nintendo and people are like yeah (93:19 - 93:23)
Chris's reality I'm like I'm not I'm not (93:25 - 93:30)
denying their reality not at all what (93:27 - 93:31)
we're trying to say is the conversation (93:30 - 93:33)
that they meant to have and we should be (93:31 - 93:36)
having is that that was a toxic toxic (93:33 - 93:39)
environment that they were not allowed (93:36 - 93:41)
to have input like they went on to say (93:39 - 93:43)
you were afraid to bring up new ideas (93:41 - 93:46)
yeah yes that's the conversation you (93:43 - 93:47)
didn't want you didn't want your bosses (93:46 - 93:50)
to be like oh right all right (93:47 - 93:52)
they're a problem they come up with (93:50 - 93:54)
ideas that like like (93:52 - 93:57)
had you sat had kitten Chris sat down (93:54 - 93:59)
and thought like bringing up an official (93:57 - 94:01)
nozzle like is a bad idea for all of (93:59 - 94:02)
these reasons or the person they brought (94:01 - 94:05)
it up to had explained any part of the (94:02 - 94:07)
league of ramifications it would have (94:05 - 94:10)
been a very different conversation (94:07 - 94:10)
they got a toxic response from a toxic (94:10 - 94:15)
work environment this is what we need to (94:13 - 94:18)
talk about not that Nintendo thinks (94:15 - 94:21)
nuzlocke's is hacking right yeah to go (94:18 - 94:24)
back to like the the difficulty I mean (94:21 - 94:25)
like I think of I think of situations (94:24 - 94:28)
where like people walk into a gym and (94:25 - 94:31)
they they knock out like the five NPCs (94:28 - 94:33)
and then they immediately leave to go to (94:31 - 94:35)
the Pokemon Center to come back into the (94:33 - 94:37)
gym to then fight the gym leader at that (94:35 - 94:38)
point you've you've artificially made it (94:37 - 94:40)
easy for yourself right like you could (94:38 - 94:42)
just battle the gym leader with with the (94:40 - 94:44)
damaged Pokemon you have but you're (94:42 - 94:46)
making that choice to make it easy and (94:44 - 94:49)
if if you're in the battle with the gym (94:46 - 94:51)
leader and you decide to use a hyper (94:49 - 94:52)
potion or you decide to use a revive (94:51 - 94:55)
instead of playing it out with the rest (94:52 - 94:58)
of your Pokemon you are making it quote (94:55 - 95:00)
unquote easier (94:58 - 95:02)
um because like you're you're losing (95:00 - 95:06)
Pokemon so I (95:02 - 95:08)
I don't even know if adding like a you (95:06 - 95:11)
know a a Nuzlocke to the game is is (95:08 - 95:15)
beneficial because like (95:11 - 95:17)
if you're using a hyper potion to get (95:15 - 95:19)
through that fight because at the end of (95:17 - 95:20)
the day that's more enjoyable for you (95:19 - 95:22)
versus I'm going to lose here and I have (95:20 - 95:24)
to do the whole thing over again like (95:22 - 95:27)
you're you're subconsciously making (95:24 - 95:29)
those choices because you want a (95:27 - 95:31)
pleasant experience (95:29 - 95:32)
um and (95:31 - 95:34)
I don't think people think of that (95:32 - 95:37)
enough right like like I'm gonna battle (95:34 - 95:39)
all the NPCs I'm gonna leave and heal (95:37 - 95:40)
I'm gonna go in I'm gonna crush the gym (95:39 - 95:42)
later man that was easy but it's like (95:40 - 95:45)
what were your actions before that if (95:42 - 95:46)
you like crushed a gym leader and you (95:45 - 95:49)
like like spammed hyper potions (95:46 - 95:51)
throughout like the like like you're (95:49 - 95:53)
making those decisions and I don't know (95:51 - 95:55)
I think the Nuzlocke thing resonates (95:53 - 95:57)
with a lot of people because they're (95:55 - 95:59)
looking at a rule set that exists and (95:57 - 96:02)
they're following those rules versus (95:59 - 96:04)
their own like creative freedom right (96:02 - 96:05)
like when I went through brilliant (96:04 - 96:07)
Diamond shining Pearl I thought those (96:05 - 96:09)
games were incredibly easy also I've (96:07 - 96:10)
played sure yeah I played Diamond and (96:09 - 96:12)
Pearl a million times like yeah I know (96:10 - 96:14)
what to expect so like I would go in and (96:12 - 96:16)
I would make my own rules for each gym (96:14 - 96:18)
leader like hey this dream leader I'm (96:16 - 96:20)
only gonna bring in three Pokemon they (96:18 - 96:22)
have three Pokemon hey this gym leader (96:20 - 96:23)
I'm gonna try to beat them with one (96:22 - 96:25)
Pokemon when I got to whatever that (96:23 - 96:28)
dude's name is the daddy guy that's that (96:25 - 96:31)
of the Roark guy I was like I'm gonna (96:28 - 96:33)
try to I'm gonna battle him blindfolded (96:31 - 96:35)
with one Pokemon and each one of those (96:33 - 96:38)
fights were they much harder no not (96:35 - 96:40)
really but they were like severely more (96:38 - 96:42)
like they were significantly more (96:40 - 96:43)
enjoyable because I was making these fun (96:42 - 96:45)
rules so like I always like try to (96:43 - 96:47)
challenge people that are like I wish (96:45 - 96:48)
Pokemon would level scare I wish Pokemon (96:47 - 96:51)
would be harder like bro you can do (96:48 - 96:53)
whatever you want before that gym fight (96:51 - 96:56)
like to be fair you brought up the uh (96:53 - 96:57)
the whole thing of like you could do (96:56 - 96:59)
kind of whatever you want leading up to (96:57 - 97:00)
it when I mentioned I had a hard time (96:59 - 97:02)
with Volo at the end of the game my team (97:00 - 97:04)
consisted of a Lickitung and an unknown (97:02 - 97:08)
D so that was like yeah (97:04 - 97:10)
on my team with the other Pokemon I had (97:08 - 97:11)
caught throughout the game and I was (97:10 - 97:13)
trying to beat him with the unknown and (97:11 - 97:15)
so you get through that first phase of (97:13 - 97:16)
the Giratina fight I beat him and then (97:15 - 97:17)
the second face comes in and kills me (97:16 - 97:19)
with like Shadow origin or whatever it's (97:17 - 97:22)
called and I got white so like that was (97:19 - 97:23)
a big reason probably why that was (97:22 - 97:26)
difficult for me but you also said (97:23 - 97:27)
something that really just stood out to (97:26 - 97:29)
me like mentioning the experience was (97:27 - 97:32)
pleasant right like how to make a (97:29 - 97:34)
pleasant experience for yourself I don't (97:32 - 97:35)
want to speak for everybody but I think (97:34 - 97:38)
all three of us probably see Pokemon as (97:35 - 97:40)
a comfort game right as something we (97:38 - 97:41)
come back to time and time again because (97:40 - 97:43)
we enjoy it it makes us feel good we (97:41 - 97:44)
have a good time playing the games we (97:43 - 97:46)
like living in this world we like (97:44 - 97:48)
experiencing you know flamethrower over (97:46 - 97:50)
again or Thunderbolts just like you were (97:48 - 97:52)
mentioning with like fira or kiraja in (97:50 - 97:54)
Final Fantasy right it's something that (97:52 - 97:56)
brings us joy it's a pleasant experience (97:54 - 97:58)
and I think for those of us that are (97:56 - 98:00)
always going to be fans of Pokemon that (97:58 - 98:01)
like Pokemon regardless if a game's (98:00 - 98:03)
easier regardless if a game's hard we're (98:01 - 98:05)
gonna make it difficult for ourselves or (98:03 - 98:06)
make it easier for ourselves at the end (98:05 - 98:08)
end of the day like our love of that (98:06 - 98:11)
thing is probably not changing in the (98:08 - 98:13)
same way that like a newer player who (98:11 - 98:14)
hasn't picked it up in a long time is (98:13 - 98:16)
probably experiencing this game someone (98:14 - 98:19)
who did not play Gen 6 or gen 7 who (98:16 - 98:21)
maybe played Gen 4 Engine 5 who's (98:19 - 98:22)
getting back into it now because they (98:21 - 98:23)
have a switch and they want to (98:22 - 98:26)
experience these games again (98:23 - 98:29)
yeah yeah I and I think that that goes (98:26 - 98:30)
back to like the experience thing of (98:29 - 98:32)
like well experience makes it too (98:30 - 98:33)
easy and it's like (98:32 - 98:36)
this is this is not the crutch you (98:33 - 98:38)
should be relying on like yeah right (98:36 - 98:41)
right like have you not played any other (98:38 - 98:43)
jrpg in the last like 15 years where (98:41 - 98:45)
experience shares just a default thing (98:43 - 98:47)
Mario rabbits right now literally (98:45 - 98:49)
currently in Mario Rabbids if you use a (98:47 - 98:51)
team of the like what the peach rabbit (98:49 - 98:53)
or Bowser or peach or whatever all the (98:51 - 98:55)
other characters I've not used rabid (98:53 - 98:57)
Luigi once in that entire game and yet (98:55 - 98:59)
Rebel Luigi is the exact same level as (98:57 - 99:00)
the three characters I've been playing (98:59 - 99:04)
with the whole time so (99:00 - 99:04)
um all right uh probably spent too long (99:05 - 99:10)
on difficulty uh hey they showed 20 (99:07 - 99:13)
Pokemon Roger what's your favorite small (99:10 - 99:14)
live I love small live I will protect (99:13 - 99:17)
small live with my life I love him I (99:14 - 99:19)
love my little anxiety Olive I think (99:17 - 99:21)
he's adorable when I first saw the (99:19 - 99:23)
trailer and they had Paul me smalliv and (99:21 - 99:26)
lechonk I thought man Le chunk is (99:23 - 99:27)
awesome I love pigs I've always been a (99:26 - 99:30)
fan of pigs uh but then I was thinking (99:27 - 99:32)
about it more and I'm like I bet you Le (99:30 - 99:33)
chonk's evolution is gonna be real ugly (99:32 - 99:36)
and I bet you smogs is gonna be awesome (99:33 - 99:38)
because I'm thinking of I'm thinking of (99:36 - 99:40)
what they could do with an olive Pokemon (99:38 - 99:42)
right and the evolution and obviously (99:40 - 99:44)
being based on like the olive branches (99:42 - 99:45)
that are in the crests of a lot of like (99:44 - 99:47)
Spanish royalty families I think they (99:45 - 99:48)
could do some real cool stuff with like (99:47 - 99:50)
an Olive Crest being sort of like a (99:48 - 99:52)
night kind of character for an evolution (99:50 - 99:54)
but even if that thing wasn't to evolve (99:52 - 99:56)
and just be like this little Derpy (99:54 - 99:59)
anxiety Olive he speaks to me I like (99:56 - 100:00)
that I like that he's this little (99:59 - 100:02)
anxious guy who doesn't know what's (100:00 - 100:04)
going on his mouth is open he's looking (100:02 - 100:06)
around all freaked out he's scared he's (100:04 - 100:08)
scared to be turned into olive oil he's (100:06 - 100:10)
scared to be on the menu at Olive Garden (100:08 - 100:12)
like I love him I'm Italian my last (100:10 - 100:15)
name's D Luigi Koza all right like we (100:12 - 100:18)
use olives in cooking I like small if I (100:15 - 100:19)
will protect him with my life that is my (100:18 - 100:21)
favorite (100:19 - 100:23)
probably the best answer that anyone's (100:21 - 100:26)
ever given for like unacceptable (100:23 - 100:29)
100 unacceptable are you are you into (100:26 - 100:30)
the the open world thing is that (100:29 - 100:33)
something that you wanted for a long (100:30 - 100:35)
time I think Arceus is not only one of (100:33 - 100:36)
my favorite games this year but it's (100:35 - 100:38)
like one of the best Pokemon games in (100:36 - 100:40)
the past decade dude I think like the (100:38 - 100:41)
changes that they made to that game (100:40 - 100:43)
having these open areas that you could (100:41 - 100:45)
wander around and like sneak around and (100:43 - 100:47)
throw pokeballs I think was great and so (100:45 - 100:50)
any sort of mix of that that we're gonna (100:47 - 100:52)
get into what we got with the wild area (100:50 - 100:54)
and sword and shield combining into what (100:52 - 100:56)
Scarlet Violet's ultimately gonna be I (100:54 - 100:59)
am here for I feel like making this open (100:56 - 101:01)
world being able to go wherever I want (100:59 - 101:03)
to go like going to the gyms or doing a (101:01 - 101:04)
Titan battle that is super exciting to (101:03 - 101:07)
me both as a content creator and as a (101:04 - 101:08)
player of these games that's wanted (101:07 - 101:10)
something different for a while this is (101:08 - 101:12)
the most excited I've been about a (101:10 - 101:15)
Pokemon game in a long like a Mainline (101:12 - 101:17)
Pokemon game in a long time I'm always (101:15 - 101:19)
excited but I'm like supremely excited (101:17 - 101:22)
for this one (101:19 - 101:22)
uh Scarlet or violet oh Scarlet (101:22 - 101:27)
obviously because the professor she's (101:25 - 101:30)
mommy of course why would why would I (101:27 - 101:32)
ever go with with kid yeah no I'm going (101:30 - 101:34)
with it I'm going with uh yeah Scarlet (101:32 - 101:36)
version all day every day now with that (101:34 - 101:38)
being said (101:36 - 101:41)
The Violet legendary is way cooler like (101:38 - 101:43)
at least in my opinion I think Violet's (101:41 - 101:45)
legendary way cooler I also don't know (101:43 - 101:47)
because I haven't really been reading (101:45 - 101:49)
into like a lot of things about the game (101:47 - 101:51)
beyond what they've revealed have they (101:49 - 101:53)
said what Pokemon or version exclusive (101:51 - 101:54)
yet because I know they're intentionally (101:53 - 101:57)
sway me okay yeah (101:54 - 101:59)
exclusive to Scarlet or Violet I'll have (101:57 - 102:01)
to get the one that has Lickitung in it (101:59 - 102:05)
yeah big draw uh I I do know that I I (102:01 - 102:08)
did grow very fond of Corydon because (102:05 - 102:11)
they they only let us play Scarlet at (102:08 - 102:14)
the Nintendo preview and after riding on (102:11 - 102:15)
Karate on for an hour I was like you (102:14 - 102:17)
know cried on is like kind of cute why (102:15 - 102:20)
does it have whales if it's only gonna (102:17 - 102:22)
use its legs I love that he uses I think (102:20 - 102:25)
it's really weird (102:22 - 102:28)
if it's only going to use its legs all (102:25 - 102:29)
right well no Pokemon of the week (102:28 - 102:31)
because Will's not here I got I got two (102:29 - 102:33)
questions of the weeks though uh can I (102:31 - 102:35)
choose a Pokemon of the week as the (102:33 - 102:37)
special guest this week can I choose a (102:35 - 102:38)
Pokemon of the week because I'm gonna (102:37 - 102:41)
say it's Lickitung okay by the week at (102:38 - 102:43)
the very end so we'll come ahead good (102:41 - 102:44)
good (102:43 - 102:46)
all right first question is when version (102:44 - 102:48)
exclusive gym leaders were announced for (102:46 - 102:51)
sword and shield uh will was upset he (102:48 - 102:52)
was going to miss out Greg agreed but (102:51 - 102:54)
Steve disagreed and saw it as a positive (102:52 - 102:56)
thing three years later do you all feel (102:54 - 102:58)
the same thing uh that was from citizen (102:56 - 103:00)
from our YouTube channel (102:58 - 103:01)
uh (103:00 - 103:03)
I mean I felt like I missed out until (103:01 - 103:05)
they were bad like there's clearly two (103:03 - 103:07)
winners and two losers of those gym (103:05 - 103:10)
leaders and I played the right one I (103:07 - 103:11)
don't think anyone missed out on Gordy (103:10 - 103:14)
no nobody missed out of Gordy at all and (103:11 - 103:18)
B was me like I I liked her but I I also (103:14 - 103:19)
love Melanie though so when it comes (103:18 - 103:21)
down to it it's like if I have to weigh (103:19 - 103:23)
B and Melanie I'm taking Melody yeah (103:21 - 103:25)
Melody Melody announcer were far (103:23 - 103:26)
superior (103:25 - 103:30)
um I do still feel that (103:26 - 103:30)
enough for you to miss anything I don't (103:33 - 103:40)
think I felt missed out per se because (103:35 - 103:41)
the way they portrayed them the gym (103:40 - 103:43)
leaders were going to be a bigger part (103:41 - 103:45)
of the game than they actually (103:43 - 103:49)
were like I decided to restart I just (103:45 - 103:52)
now restarted sword to see what it's (103:49 - 103:55)
like playing the game with both DLCs at (103:52 - 103:57)
the start and it's a wild experience I'm (103:55 - 103:59)
going to tell you that right now I'm (103:57 - 104:01)
like I have no idea what's happening in (103:59 - 104:02)
this game right now because you're (104:01 - 104:03)
pulling me in so many different (104:02 - 104:05)
directions everywhere I go like oh (104:03 - 104:07)
something's happening over here and I'm (104:05 - 104:08)
like well what do you want me to focus (104:07 - 104:10)
on because you're now telling me there's (104:08 - 104:13)
like 17 things I have to do (104:10 - 104:14)
um I don't think I feel like I missed (104:13 - 104:17)
out I think I'm still (104:14 - 104:19)
not (104:17 - 104:21)
thrilled about it because ultimately (104:19 - 104:25)
it's a pointless change like the two gym (104:21 - 104:28)
leaders were they weren't a big part of (104:25 - 104:30)
the game they they didn't have great (104:28 - 104:32)
personalities they didn't develop either (104:30 - 104:35)
side like both gyms puzzles were roughly (104:32 - 104:37)
the same they were the same yeah they (104:35 - 104:38)
were they just it was just like they're (104:37 - 104:42)
different it was superficial at best (104:38 - 104:45)
um so I mean I (104:42 - 104:48)
I don't feel like I still don't feel (104:45 - 104:50)
like I missed out I I would say that I (104:48 - 104:51)
don't feel like I missed out but I still (104:50 - 104:52)
don't think it was a good decision (104:51 - 104:55)
because ultimately it was a pointless (104:52 - 104:56)
decision (104:55 - 104:59)
it just didn't serve the games I I like (104:56 - 105:01)
having just more character I think that (104:59 - 105:02)
I think they've done a really good job (105:01 - 105:05)
at making Gym Leaders or characters or (105:02 - 105:06)
elite four members (105:05 - 105:09)
like as important as Pokemon (105:06 - 105:11)
um so I mean that was something with (105:09 - 105:13)
sword and shield specifically as I think (105:11 - 105:15)
there were a couple Generations there (105:13 - 105:17)
where like I I'm a hardcore Pokemon fan (105:15 - 105:19)
I cannot name all the gym leaders from (105:17 - 105:21)
certain Generations but like sword and (105:19 - 105:23)
shield they were all very very memorable (105:21 - 105:25)
even the ones I didn't like like you (105:23 - 105:26)
were talking about Gordy it's like I (105:25 - 105:27)
didn't care about Gordy but I remember (105:26 - 105:30)
his name so I think however they (105:27 - 105:32)
implemented them into the story I think (105:30 - 105:34)
was really well done in terms of like (105:32 - 105:37)
you remembering who this person is even (105:34 - 105:38)
if they didn't actually impact the story (105:37 - 105:40)
that much as a whole (105:38 - 105:42)
yeah I think I like having multiple Gym (105:40 - 105:44)
Leaders only because Masters exist now (105:42 - 105:47)
yeah right I mean that was probably the (105:44 - 105:49)
whole the the whole yeah the whole (105:47 - 105:52)
Market show we need more team leaders I (105:49 - 105:54)
will say that Cynthia has decided to woo (105:52 - 105:56)
me hard in that game and I am not (105:54 - 105:58)
prepared I am not prepared for this (105:56 - 106:00)
Champion knocking at my door all the (105:58 - 106:02)
time (106:00 - 106:05)
um yeah I don't I don't know if it was (106:02 - 106:08)
the right choice to have two different (106:05 - 106:10)
gym leaders per every game but also like (106:08 - 106:12)
if you think about black and white one (106:10 - 106:13)
game had a whole city that was (106:12 - 106:15)
completely different it was either black (106:13 - 106:18)
City or white forest and it's like I I I (106:15 - 106:21)
would argue that that was more and more (106:18 - 106:24)
important than like Gordy and Alistair (106:21 - 106:26)
yeah I mean if they had created a (106:24 - 106:29)
completely different town around those (106:26 - 106:32)
and it felt like a very different shift (106:29 - 106:36)
that I I would I would be harder on the (106:32 - 106:37)
I think I missed out I just think (106:36 - 106:40)
ultimately a better decision would have (106:37 - 106:42)
been to have two gyms and you pick which (106:40 - 106:44)
one you took on then having them in (106:42 - 106:47)
separate in separate games (106:44 - 106:49)
um I just think I just think it felt (106:47 - 106:52)
then and it still feels now that it was (106:49 - 106:54)
a slightly arbitrary way to sell more (106:52 - 106:58)
sell both games (106:54 - 106:58)
yeah I mean (106:58 - 107:02)
they're very good at putting out two (107:00 - 107:04)
identical games and then selling you (107:02 - 107:06)
both and then a year later putting the (107:04 - 107:08)
word Ultra before them and then selling (107:06 - 107:11)
them both again exactly but the worst (107:08 - 107:14)
story uh Mitch from YouTube yes wait can (107:11 - 107:16)
we hold on because I am not normally (107:14 - 107:17)
with someone that agrees with that (107:16 - 107:19)
opinion Greg could you say that a little (107:17 - 107:20)
louder for the people in the back (107:19 - 107:23)
regarding what that you just said about (107:20 - 107:25)
Ultra sun and Ultra Moon please Greg (107:23 - 107:26)
please send an ultra Moon has a worse (107:25 - 107:28)
story than Thunderman Thunderman has the (107:26 - 107:31)
better story 100 this is (107:28 - 107:34)
objective facts objective facts (107:31 - 107:39)
a massacre on a level never seen before (107:34 - 107:41)
in Pokemon what they do to loosamine (107:39 - 107:44)
absolutely Dreadful thank you Greg thank (107:41 - 107:46)
you for speaking to me and all those (107:44 - 107:47)
other people out there that I know feel (107:46 - 107:51)
the exact same way thank you uh I I I do (107:47 - 107:52)
agree although like if somebody's gonna (107:51 - 107:54)
ask me which one to buy I'm gonna say (107:52 - 107:55)
Ultra because there's way more because (107:54 - 107:57)
there's more content for sure yeah I (107:55 - 107:59)
always tell people Ultra Sun Ultra moon (107:57 - 108:01)
is a better game so sure (107:59 - 108:06)
they are better games but the story is (108:01 - 108:08)
way worse than an ultra moon and the (108:06 - 108:11)
story announcer Moon Ultra sun is even (108:08 - 108:13)
worse if you didn't play sun and moon (108:11 - 108:15)
because they kind of shortcut a lot of (108:13 - 108:17)
things as soon as you played the first (108:15 - 108:19)
ones you're like if I just played this (108:17 - 108:21)
on my own this story does not make a lot (108:19 - 108:23)
of sense agreed agreed the best part (108:21 - 108:25)
about the ultrasound Ultra Moon story is (108:23 - 108:27)
the uh Ultra Rincon Squad freaking out (108:25 - 108:29)
about fur fruit and not understanding (108:27 - 108:32)
like that that whole like that in itself (108:29 - 108:35)
was great yeah I think the ultra Recon (108:32 - 108:39)
Squad is awesome I think the implica (108:35 - 108:41)
implications they did in Sun and Moon of (108:39 - 108:44)
multiple universes existing that they (108:41 - 108:46)
doubled down on in Omega Ruby Alpha (108:44 - 108:49)
Sapphire like the idea that there are (108:46 - 108:51)
alternate universes alternate timeline (108:49 - 108:53)
where Pokemon have developed differently (108:51 - 108:56)
opened them up to a whole new world of (108:53 - 108:58)
Pokemon design yeah that I think was (108:56 - 109:00)
important in having the ultra Recon (108:58 - 109:03)
Squad confirm that that these wormholes (109:00 - 109:04)
aren't like weird Pockets where only (109:03 - 109:06)
Pokemon exists but there are also people (109:04 - 109:09)
there who have been who have very (109:06 - 109:11)
different experiences with Pokemon like (109:09 - 109:13)
it's a ripe (109:11 - 109:15)
storytelling beat that they are going to (109:13 - 109:18)
do nothing with which is a shame (109:15 - 109:21)
um but at least sort of exists as part (109:18 - 109:23)
of the lore that I think that I will (109:21 - 109:25)
give one credit to the story of ultra (109:23 - 109:28)
Sun Ultra moon for like you introduced (109:25 - 109:30)
and underlined the multi-universe (109:28 - 109:33)
multi-time line idea (109:30 - 109:35)
you did everything I'll sign that with (109:33 - 109:37)
you you did everything else poorly with (109:35 - 109:39)
the story but this one beat you did good (109:37 - 109:42)
co-signed yep uh we technically already (109:39 - 109:44)
answered this question yeah we did this (109:42 - 109:46)
a lot so (109:44 - 109:48)
uh Mitch from our YouTube says do you (109:46 - 109:51)
think the lack of level scaling in game (109:48 - 109:53)
free uh in Scarlet Violet is game (109:51 - 109:54)
freak's way of combating players that (109:53 - 109:58)
complain about the games being too easy (109:54 - 110:00)
um yeah I think I think we had like a 45 (109:58 - 110:02)
minute conversation about exhaustive (110:00 - 110:06)
yeah a conversation yeah uh (110:02 - 110:09)
but yeah I uh (110:06 - 110:11)
I mean like again the last thing I could (110:09 - 110:13)
say is like you know you can play breath (110:11 - 110:15)
of wild you can get out of the the to (110:13 - 110:17)
the tomb you could walk right to Ganon (110:15 - 110:20)
and Ganon isn't gonna scale for you yeah (110:17 - 110:25)
like he is he is exactly the level he he (110:20 - 110:27)
is at the beginning of the game or at (110:25 - 110:29)
the end of the game so (110:27 - 110:31)
um I can't think of a lot of open world (110:29 - 110:32)
games that do scale I feel like the last (110:31 - 110:34)
video game I played that scaled was like (110:32 - 110:38)
Final Fantasy 8 and I hated it (110:34 - 110:39)
hey I gotta think about it I don't know (110:38 - 110:42)
there's not a lot that really scale (110:39 - 110:44)
um I think the difference again is the (110:42 - 110:47)
feeling of people people feel better (110:44 - 110:49)
when they have more control like you can (110:47 - 110:52)
walk straight to to the end of breath of (110:49 - 110:54)
the wild and you're still relying on (110:52 - 110:56)
your ability to roll Dodge and attack (110:54 - 110:58)
appropriately yeah instead of I'm locked (110:56 - 111:01)
into a turn right like (110:58 - 111:05)
those games feel different because you (111:01 - 111:07)
feel like you have more Free Will and (111:05 - 111:11)
that you as a person can overcome the (111:07 - 111:16)
levels like I relying on my skill to (111:11 - 111:19)
overcome this level Gap and it's a very (111:16 - 111:20)
different feel than what we have in (111:19 - 111:22)
Pokemon yeah (111:20 - 111:25)
foreign (111:22 - 111:25)
this is my absolute favorite Pokemon of (111:33 - 111:38)
all time let me tell a little story as (111:36 - 111:40)
to why Lickitung is my favorite because (111:38 - 111:42)
it's weird it's not because he's good in (111:40 - 111:44)
Pokemon go competitive this is why okay (111:42 - 111:47)
I have a distinct core memory of going (111:44 - 111:51)
to Toys R Us with my dad right after I (111:47 - 111:52)
got into the Pokemon Trading Card Game (111:51 - 111:55)
this was prior to me ever playing the (111:52 - 111:58)
video games I I didn't own a Game Boy it (111:55 - 112:01)
was just the card game so I'd only seen (111:58 - 112:02)
the Pokemon that are in like your (112:01 - 112:04)
initial two decks which were at the time (112:02 - 112:06)
it was like the zap deck that had Mewtwo (112:04 - 112:08)
and Pikachu and the electric and psychic (112:06 - 112:10)
ones and then it was the deck with um (112:08 - 112:12)
Machamp the starter deck and I think (112:10 - 112:13)
there was one other one too wasn't it (112:12 - 112:16)
like a water fire once there was a water (112:13 - 112:18)
yeah yeah so those those were my only (112:16 - 112:19)
experience with Pokemon and playing the (112:18 - 112:21)
card game okay (112:19 - 112:23)
and jungle hadn't come out yet so I (112:21 - 112:24)
didn't see that Lickitung card yet (112:23 - 112:25)
whatever (112:24 - 112:27)
I went to Toys R Us I got a Nintendo (112:25 - 112:28)
Power with my dad the only system I (112:27 - 112:31)
owned was an N64 and I saw there was a (112:28 - 112:33)
cover story about Pokemon Stadium I (112:31 - 112:34)
thought this is really cool we walked (112:33 - 112:37)
from the Toys R Us to the Old Country (112:34 - 112:39)
Buffet that was next door and I sat (112:37 - 112:41)
there at the Old Country Buffet with my (112:39 - 112:43)
dad eating dinner and reading this (112:41 - 112:45)
Nintendo power and opening up to this (112:43 - 112:47)
Pokemon Stadium article and being like (112:45 - 112:50)
wow they have Pokemon video games and (112:47 - 112:53)
the first screenshot that I saw was of (112:50 - 112:56)
an in-game screenshot of the the Masters (112:53 - 112:59)
stadium and the rental Pokemon I don't (112:56 - 113:00)
know if you remember the rental move set (112:59 - 113:03)
of Lickitung in Pokemon Stadium if you (113:00 - 113:04)
don't let me remind you because it's (113:03 - 113:07)
burned into my memory all right this man (113:04 - 113:09)
has Thunder (113:07 - 113:13)
blizzard fire blast and Hyper Beam and I (113:09 - 113:16)
remember seeing this little screenshot (113:13 - 113:18)
of Lickitung in 3D mind you again the (113:16 - 113:20)
first Pokemon beyond the ones that were (113:18 - 113:22)
on the front cover like Mewtwo and the (113:20 - 113:23)
starters and Pikachu the first Pokemon (113:22 - 113:26)
that I ever saw in 3D Lickitung and his (113:23 - 113:29)
moveset is thunder blizzard fire blast (113:26 - 113:31)
and Hyper Beam I thought this has got to (113:29 - 113:33)
be the most powerful Pokemon of all time (113:31 - 113:36)
I love this guy he's so cool so I played (113:33 - 113:39)
through after I got that Christmas I got (113:36 - 113:41)
my Pokemon Yellow I played through the (113:39 - 113:43)
game I do you know the the Mystery (113:41 - 113:44)
Dungeon at the ending I catch a (113:43 - 113:47)
Lickitung in the wild I'm like I'm so (113:44 - 113:48)
excited he's gonna destroy everything (113:47 - 113:51)
I'm gonna use him competitively come to (113:48 - 113:52)
find out he's got like body slam and (113:51 - 113:54)
lick and I'm like what the heck is this (113:52 - 113:56)
about why does he not have thunder why (113:54 - 113:57)
does he not have fire blast why is he (113:56 - 114:00)
not a blizzard turns out those are TM (113:57 - 114:01)
moves for him that you could buy from (114:00 - 114:03)
the Celadon department store you could (114:01 - 114:04)
teach it to him but it doesn't naturally (114:03 - 114:06)
learn those moves but it didn't matter (114:04 - 114:09)
because at that point I was so obsessed (114:06 - 114:10)
with tongue wanting to catch this (114:09 - 114:12)
Pokemon thinking it was the coolest (114:10 - 114:14)
thing that I went to Celadon I bought (114:12 - 114:16)
all the right TMS and I had my Lickitung (114:14 - 114:18)
in Pokemon yellow after beating the game (114:16 - 114:20)
I didn't care about Mewtwo Mewtwo who (114:18 - 114:21)
knew who is what his name is I didn't (114:20 - 114:23)
care about Mewtwo I had Lickitung and I (114:21 - 114:26)
gave him Thunder fire blast blizzard and (114:23 - 114:28)
Hyper Beam and every game in which I I (114:26 - 114:30)
could have a Lickitung on my main Squad (114:28 - 114:33)
I have had a Lickitung ever since I love (114:30 - 114:36)
him I love the design I love that of all (114:33 - 114:38)
the Pokemon they could have put in (114:36 - 114:40)
detective Pikachu they chose to show (114:38 - 114:44)
what a real life Lickitung is like he's (114:40 - 114:47)
horrific but I love him so much it is (114:44 - 114:51)
Nightmare fuel that I'm obsessed I was (114:47 - 114:53)
terrifying in that (114:51 - 114:56)
and then in the anime right Jesse gets (114:53 - 114:58)
the lick a tongue she gets a lick a (114:56 - 115:00)
tongue right and it's an epic episode of (114:58 - 115:03)
the show where lickitung's running (115:00 - 115:04)
through this tournament battling (115:03 - 115:06)
everybody taking down all these other (115:04 - 115:08)
powerful Pokemon that ends up being the (115:06 - 115:10)
first Pokemon that gets traded away from (115:08 - 115:12)
a major character in the anime because (115:10 - 115:14)
she trades the Lickitung for Wobbuffet (115:12 - 115:16)
who is now a series staple you would not (115:14 - 115:19)
have one about that without licking it (115:16 - 115:20)
wouldn't happen that all right it would (115:19 - 115:23)
be fine so all the Wobbuffet stands that (115:20 - 115:25)
are out there I just want you to know (115:23 - 115:27)
you lived because Lickitung died let me (115:25 - 115:29)
say that right now that is why you're (115:27 - 115:32)
able to enjoy your wealth of Wobbuffet (115:29 - 115:34)
content because Lickitung was traded (115:32 - 115:37)
away during the Johto era I love (115:34 - 115:38)
Lickitung I could talk about this for (115:37 - 115:40)
the 20 minutes I love the fact that he's (115:38 - 115:42)
good competitively in Pokemon go now I (115:40 - 115:43)
didn't even realize it was a thing until (115:42 - 115:45)
Zoe was telling me about it when we were (115:43 - 115:47)
at Worlds and I'm like wait what so now (115:45 - 115:49)
I'm using all my lickitungs and go (115:47 - 115:51)
competitively I could not be happier we (115:49 - 115:54)
are in the era of Lickitung and if I I (115:51 - 115:56)
may One More Story just to throw in (115:54 - 115:59)
there to prove that I am the number one (115:56 - 116:01)
Lickitung stand in the world all right (115:59 - 116:04)
in 2019 I went to Japan for the first (116:01 - 116:05)
time (116:04 - 116:07)
I went to the Pokemon Center you know (116:05 - 116:09)
they have those cute little uh 151 cutie (116:07 - 116:11)
plushies right of all the different (116:09 - 116:12)
Pokemon (116:11 - 116:15)
I go to the Pokemon Center in Osaka and (116:12 - 116:17)
I walk up to their display and they have (116:15 - 116:19)
every one of those plushies except one (116:17 - 116:21)
Greg can you guess the one plushie they (116:19 - 116:25)
didn't have at the store cramerant (116:21 - 116:28)
they did not have a cutie Lickitung and (116:25 - 116:31)
I asked the store employee in Japan why (116:28 - 116:33)
are there no lickitungs because if you (116:31 - 116:35)
looked at the store display they have (116:33 - 116:36)
all the little names written down and (116:35 - 116:38)
their number next to it yeah and there (116:36 - 116:41)
was a jump between ride on and (116:38 - 116:42)
Hitmonchan or whatever it is it's like (116:41 - 116:44)
Hitman Lee and Rhyhorn or something is (116:42 - 116:45)
where lickitung's in between the Pokedex (116:44 - 116:47)
and I'm like why is there no Lickitung (116:45 - 116:49)
the store employee in Japan I kid you (116:47 - 116:52)
not went oh yeah no one likes Lickitung (116:49 - 116:54)
we just never stock like a tongue (116:52 - 116:58)
and I was blown away so I made it a goal (116:54 - 117:00)
for my first ever trip to Japan to go to (116:58 - 117:01)
every Pokemon Center that I could I went (117:00 - 117:03)

Tokyo I went to the one at the Sky Tree (117:03 - 117:07)

Lickitung none of them had the Lickitung (117:07 - 117:11)
cutie until the day we were leaving we (117:09 - 117:14)
were taking the train to Tokyo Airport (117:11 - 117:16)

omanite is really popular and I was like (118:29 - 118:33)

um and then I proceeded to go to other (118:33 - 118:36)
Pokemon centers and they also didn't (118:35 - 118:38)
have Omanyte but I eventually I found an (118:36 - 118:41)
omanite at Skytree uh there you go well (118:38 - 118:42)

you how dare you question the Church of (122:03 - 122:10)
Lickitung Smite you wait did you know (122:06 - 122:14)
according to Bulbapedia I have one more (122:10 - 122:16)
question licking tongue I have one one (122:14 - 122:19)
more question before we wrap up this (122:16 - 122:21)
episode uh is is how do you feel about (122:19 - 122:23)
lickitung's Evolution the worst thing (122:21 - 122:25)
you ever made I hate licky licky I hope (122:23 - 122:28)
it never exists (122:25 - 122:31)
in a movie despise it I despise it I (122:28 - 122:34)
despise licky licky I think here here we (122:31 - 122:36)
go all right we're getting to one more (122:34 - 122:39)
discussion topic I think it is Criminal (122:36 - 122:41)
criminal that licky licky is the (122:39 - 122:43)
evolution of Lickitung because the one (122:41 - 122:45)
big thing I want to say from when I was (122:43 - 122:48)
a little kid and I saw Lickitung in the (122:45 - 122:50)
Pokemon Stadium game in that N64 (122:48 - 122:53)
Nintendo Power showcase thing I thought (122:50 - 122:55)
Lickitung was gonna be part dragon type (122:53 - 122:58)
because he has got like a dragon tail (122:55 - 123:00)
and he's like a lizard thing I thought (122:58 - 123:02)
he was gonna be a dragon type I can't (123:00 - 123:04)
understand I see I see it yeah so I (123:02 - 123:06)
thought that eventually if we were ever (123:04 - 123:08)
going to get a Lickitung Evolution that (123:06 - 123:10)
it would be normal Dragon kind of like (123:08 - 123:13)
how drampa is and or it would be like a (123:10 - 123:14)
dragon type it would become a dragon (123:13 - 123:15)
like dragonflying or whatever it would (123:14 - 123:17)
just change its typing and I expected (123:15 - 123:20)
this big Lickitung with wings and an (123:17 - 123:22)
even longer tongue and be flying around (123:20 - 123:24)
with this Derpy little face and he'd be (123:22 - 123:25)
the cutest little pink Dragon you ever (123:24 - 123:27)
done seen but that didn't end up (123:25 - 123:29)
happening we got licky licky who's an (123:27 - 123:32)
Abomination who's a built-in bib because (123:29 - 123:34)
he drools over himself all the time I I (123:32 - 123:36)
do not like licky licky I don't I know (123:34 - 123:38)

lost origin lost Origins okay there's a (123:44 - 123:49)
licky licky card in that that is (123:47 - 123:51)
actually cute that licky licky actually (123:49 - 123:53)
looks acceptable but normally licky (123:51 - 123:55)
licky is an Abomination (123:53 - 123:59)
licky licky literally on his chest tells (123:55 - 124:01)
you if you have a strong Wi-Fi signal (123:59 - 124:04)
I don't I didn't do that so does (124:01 - 124:08)
Lickitung I mean he does a lesser two um (124:04 - 124:11)
it covers that sign though it's it (124:08 - 124:13)
covers it with a tongue so you don't (124:11 - 124:14)
