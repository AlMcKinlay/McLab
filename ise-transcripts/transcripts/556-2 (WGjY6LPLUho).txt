[Music] (0:13 - 0:20)
what's up everyone welcome to a (0:22 - 0:28)
crossover episode of uh it's super (0:25 - 0:31)
effective and gocast uh I'm your host (0:28 - 0:35)
Steve the other host here is Chris hello (0:31 - 0:37)
hello hello how's it going (0:35 - 0:40)
we're here uh we're you know like we're (0:37 - 0:44)
being a Slowpoke on maybe talking about (0:40 - 0:46)
Vegas well I'm sure you guys have gone (0:44 - 0:48)
more in depth for Vegas I got (0:46 - 0:49)
sidetracked with (0:48 - 0:52)
uh scarlet and violet news (0:49 - 0:53)
um (0:52 - 0:56)
but we were both there yeah yeah I was (0:53 - 0:58)
about to say we are here but more (0:56 - 1:00)
importantly we were there in Vegas at (0:58 - 1:01)
the same time (1:00 - 1:03)
um and yeah I mean easy for you to get (1:01 - 1:05)
distracted there's a lot of stuff going (1:03 - 1:07)
on in Pokemon sphere there was Pokemon (1:05 - 1:09)
day like the next week and everything (1:07 - 1:10)
and uh you know it's easier for us (1:09 - 1:12)
because we just focus on goes so yeah (1:10 - 1:15)
what else was there to talk about oh you (1:12 - 1:17)
know their sleep which I guess that's (1:15 - 1:19)
true go integration you know (1:17 - 1:22)
groundbreaking yeah all that stuff (1:19 - 1:24)
um so yeah I wanted to give my thoughts (1:22 - 1:26)
on Vegas and you were there I was there (1:24 - 1:32)
uh the sand was there uh yeah (1:26 - 1:32)
and I think for maybe you guys didn't (1:32 - 1:37)
talk about it I'm also behind my podcast (1:35 - 1:39)
so I'm sorry I think the kind of the (1:37 - 1:41)
goal I wanted with our crossover episode (1:39 - 1:42)
is to really (1:41 - 1:45)
answer the question or kind of explain (1:42 - 1:48)
maybe if these in-person events are (1:45 - 1:51)
worth it because I think there's going (1:48 - 1:53)
to be more this year (1:51 - 1:54)
um (1:53 - 1:57)
specifically you know go Fest usually (1:54 - 1:59)
there's three locations it's always been (1:57 - 2:01)
somewhere in the United States somewhere (1:59 - 2:04)
in Europe well mostly Germany and then (2:01 - 2:05)
Japan (2:04 - 2:09)
um so uh the thing I want to start off (2:05 - 2:11)
with right away because like is it worth (2:09 - 2:15)
it should you travel to this is (2:11 - 2:19)
there were like no kids in Vegas (2:15 - 2:21)
and I didn't really think about it until (2:19 - 2:23)
after I left the event now there were (2:21 - 2:25)
parents pushing strollers but I'm gonna (2:23 - 2:27)
say like little Timmy in the stroller (2:25 - 2:30)
probably not playing go probably (2:27 - 2:31)
sleeping (2:30 - 2:33)
um and there I'm sure there's going to (2:31 - 2:35)
be like somebody like furiously typing (2:33 - 2:38)
like my kids were there there were kids (2:35 - 2:42)
there but like the adult to kid ratio (2:38 - 2:43)
was like (2:42 - 2:45)
95 (2:43 - 2:47)
you have a job (2:45 - 2:51)
and this is this has been a a weekend (2:47 - 2:52)
for you kind of thing (2:51 - 2:54)
yeah I think it was definitely much more (2:52 - 2:56)
representative of what you would (2:54 - 2:59)
probably expect is like the um the (2:56 - 3:01)
normal event attendee sort of players (2:59 - 3:04)
and I do mean even like local events (3:01 - 3:05)
like Community day and stuff like that (3:04 - 3:08)
because the average player won't this is (3:05 - 3:10)
my understanding is that the average (3:08 - 3:13)
player doesn't really engage with all (3:10 - 3:14)
events all the time they usually log (3:13 - 3:17)
into like oh wow a community is (3:14 - 3:18)
right now and throw a few balls right (3:17 - 3:21)
but if if you pay attention you're gonna (3:18 - 3:24)
be there and Pokemon go really rewards (3:21 - 3:28)
having like a car and disposable income (3:24 - 3:30)
and you know things that adults have (3:28 - 3:31)
that might be more difficult or (3:30 - 3:33)
challenging for like an eight or nine (3:31 - 3:35)
year old to get their hands on right (3:33 - 3:37)
I think it's also like (3:35 - 3:40)
I mean I remember like I I then thinking (3:37 - 3:42)
like there wasn't a lot of kids there (3:40 - 3:44)
again there were kids just not a lot (3:42 - 3:47)
compared to the amount of adults or or (3:44 - 3:49)
um even like I would I would say like (3:47 - 3:52)
even if you separated out like (3:49 - 3:55)
between 20 and 50 like there were more (3:52 - 3:57)
like older I don't want to offend anyone (3:55 - 3:59)
there were more older like retired folks (3:57 - 4:01)
than there were even kids which we know (3:59 - 4:03)
that from local communities that like (4:01 - 4:04)
yeah (4:03 - 4:07)
those people like to play the game too (4:04 - 4:09)
um that's not unheard of (4:07 - 4:11)
um but I I kind of thought like if (4:09 - 4:13)
Pokemon get go came out when I was like (4:11 - 4:16)
10 or 11 or even younger eight or nine (4:13 - 4:20)
like how much would I be playing it (4:16 - 4:23)
right and I feel like that's kind of (4:20 - 4:25)
dependent on the level of involvement (4:23 - 4:27)
you have like with your from your family (4:25 - 4:28)
and things like that like I was super (4:27 - 4:31)
into Pokemon when I was 10 11 right yeah (4:28 - 4:33)
I was on my front porch trading cards (4:31 - 4:34)
left and right but that was even hard (4:33 - 4:36)
for me too because I was limited in what (4:34 - 4:39)
I had because I couldn't buy more or I'd (4:36 - 4:41)
have to wait for a reason for my parents (4:39 - 4:44)
to get me a booster pack yeah and if I (4:41 - 4:46)
had had a car right let's just imagine a (4:44 - 4:48)
world where an 11 year old can drive a (4:46 - 4:51)
car and that's a safe thing to do uh (4:48 - 4:53)
like I would have gone to tournaments (4:51 - 4:56)
for TCG and and you know try my best or (4:53 - 4:59)
whatever but because like it just seemed (4:56 - 5:02)
like such a big ask for my folks right (4:59 - 5:04)
for me to me to even ask right and I (5:02 - 5:06)
feel like go might be a little bit (5:04 - 5:08)
different in that aspect because it's (5:06 - 5:10)
free and parents can engage with it (5:08 - 5:12)
without investing too much money or (5:10 - 5:13)
their time (5:12 - 5:15)
um and so yeah I guess this kind of just (5:13 - 5:17)
goes to your point though they're not (5:15 - 5:20)
being a lot of kids they're at the event (5:17 - 5:23)
I think it begs another question of did (5:20 - 5:24)
the setting have a lot to do with it (5:23 - 5:27)
because it was Vegas did it sort of like (5:24 - 5:30)
exacerbate that thing we already see and (5:27 - 5:32)
like communities and stuff is it less (5:30 - 5:34)
kids because they had nothing else to do (5:32 - 5:36)
during the time so why would they go or (5:34 - 5:37)
I don't know (5:36 - 5:40)
well I would I would yeah I would say (5:37 - 5:42)
there was more families on Sunday which (5:40 - 5:46)
is a very con thing like if you've ever (5:42 - 5:49)
been to a Pax or a c2e2 or a Midwest (5:46 - 5:52)
Gaming Classic or whatever right (5:49 - 5:54)
um they always Sunday is always like (5:52 - 5:55)
family day it's always like slightly (5:54 - 5:57)
cheaper it's always like kids get in for (5:55 - 6:01)
free so yeah there were in my uh I don't (5:57 - 6:02)
know I thought my eyes were working uh (6:01 - 6:04)
on Sunday I definitely saw more families (6:02 - 6:07)
but I also saw those families like throw (6:04 - 6:10)
in the towel earlier in the day (6:07 - 6:12)
like oh it you know we were here since (6:10 - 6:15)
10 it's two or three o'clock Little (6:12 - 6:18)
Sally is getting fussy we know we've (6:15 - 6:20)
finished our research time to go home (6:18 - 6:22)
kind of thing and then there were (6:20 - 6:24)
probably people more so (6:22 - 6:26)
your age or my age that were like we're (6:24 - 6:28)
getting both days we're grinding for (6:26 - 6:30)
morning tonight (6:28 - 6:32)
um we're grinding even the Rayquaza (6:30 - 6:35)
after the event is over kind of thing uh (6:32 - 6:37)
so (6:35 - 6:39)
I I don't know if that's like (6:37 - 6:41)
I don't know what to really do with that (6:39 - 6:42)
information (6:41 - 6:46)
besides like (6:42 - 6:46)
I guess maybe the the the retort of like (6:47 - 6:51)
oh Pokemon is a kid's thing and it's (6:49 - 6:54)
like these events really kind of focus (6:51 - 6:56)
on like (6:54 - 6:59)
people with money (6:56 - 6:59)
you know because I feel like if they had (6:59 - 7:03)
led out the gate when they started doing (7:01 - 7:06)
Live Events with something like this in (7:03 - 7:08)
Vegas for two days at the price points (7:06 - 7:11)
that they were pushing would have been (7:08 - 7:13)
um rather ignorant to what they were or (7:11 - 7:15)
weren't (7:13 - 7:17)
um you know expecting out of the game (7:15 - 7:20)
and I think the this event and the way (7:17 - 7:22)
that it was priced and where it was and (7:20 - 7:24)
some of that is a direct symptom of the (7:22 - 7:26)
data they have on who is playing the (7:24 - 7:28)
game and who is spending money and who's (7:26 - 7:30)
going to these events like I don't think (7:28 - 7:31)
four years ago we would have expected to (7:30 - 7:33)
see an event like this at all (7:31 - 7:35)
yeah (7:33 - 7:36)
um (7:35 - 7:38)
I'm sure I'm sure you talked about all (7:36 - 7:40)
of the issues that happened with the (7:38 - 7:42)
event (7:40 - 7:46)
um yeah we did (7:42 - 7:46)
um I think (7:46 - 7:49)
I think the thing that kind of stood out (7:48 - 7:53)
to me is it almost felt and I saw other (7:49 - 7:56)
people uh kind of (7:53 - 7:58)
parrot this it almost felt like this (7:56 - 8:02)
event was worse than the first go Fest (7:58 - 8:06)
oh and uh I I you you didn't go to the (8:02 - 8:08)
first go Fest right I did I was there I (8:06 - 8:12)
did okay what was you what was your (8:08 - 8:14)
thoughts of the first because I I liked (8:12 - 8:17)
the first go Fest issues aside I I had a (8:14 - 8:20)
great time but what were your thoughts (8:17 - 8:22)
you know I had a great time too (8:20 - 8:24)
um there's a lot of parallels between (8:22 - 8:26)
the first go Fest and this go Tour event (8:24 - 8:28)
for me personally the prime one is the (8:26 - 8:31)
amount of sunburn that I had (8:28 - 8:31)
to learn never learned that lesson no (8:32 - 8:35)
but the first go Fest was really cool (8:34 - 8:38)
and I think it was intoxicating to me (8:35 - 8:40)
personally like very a good experience (8:38 - 8:42)
because it's the first time I'd been in (8:40 - 8:44)
a group of go players like that and the (8:42 - 8:47)
energy was electric and there were food (8:44 - 8:50)
trucks and I was like wow this is what I (8:47 - 8:52)
want out of a music festival but it's (8:50 - 8:54)
for Pokemon go instead and so the fact (8:52 - 8:56)
that the game didn't really work just (8:54 - 8:59)
kind of gave all of us something to uh (8:56 - 9:01)
have camaraderie about it almost like (8:59 - 9:04)
fed into it a little bit and I connected (9:01 - 9:05)
for like three seconds I got my hair (9:04 - 9:07)
across and I was happy you know (9:05 - 9:10)
yeah I mean during that time too there (9:07 - 9:12)
were no shinies (9:10 - 9:14)
um that's right the raids just launched (9:12 - 9:17)
so like their big debut was Lugia and (9:14 - 9:20)
then Articuno as well because Mystic one (9:17 - 9:21)
um (9:20 - 9:22)
but (9:21 - 9:24)
for as many people that are like oh my (9:22 - 9:26)
gosh that first go Fest was a complete (9:24 - 9:29)
disaster it was a disaster but it was (9:26 - 9:30)
like (9:29 - 9:33)
like a bad movie that's so bad that (9:30 - 9:35)
you're like I'm kind of having a good (9:33 - 9:36)
time there are bad movies where you're (9:35 - 9:38)
like I'm just walking out and I think (9:36 - 9:39)
there are plenty of people that (9:38 - 9:41)
literally left (9:39 - 9:43)
and they they only had that terrible (9:41 - 9:46)
experience they left and they didn't (9:43 - 9:48)
really I don't know like listen to (9:46 - 9:49)
Niantic at the time now that being said (9:48 - 9:52)
I have a video of the crowd booing John (9:49 - 9:54)
Henke on my YouTube it's like my third (9:52 - 9:56)
most watched video I don't really it's (9:54 - 9:58)
literally like three minutes of just a (9:56 - 10:00)
bunch of people booing him does it have (9:58 - 10:03)
the water bottle throw in it too I don't (10:00 - 10:06)
know okay (10:03 - 10:07)
I have (10:06 - 10:09)
it's not in the crowd I was kind of (10:07 - 10:11)
above the crowd okay (10:09 - 10:14)
so a little a little history here before (10:11 - 10:16)
we get to Vegas I got there early I had (10:14 - 10:18)
a press pass (10:16 - 10:21)
um and I remember walking through the (10:18 - 10:24)
uh grounds before it opened and it just (10:21 - 10:27)
rained like the night before so (10:24 - 10:30)
everything was muddy and I saw people (10:27 - 10:32)
were struggling to get things set up so (10:30 - 10:35)
like before they even opened the gates I (10:32 - 10:38)
was like none of this is set up and it's (10:35 - 10:40)
like super muddy and like at the time it (10:38 - 10:42)
was cloudy obviously the clouds went (10:40 - 10:44)
away and then we everyone in line got (10:42 - 10:46)
sunburned sure I was like this seems (10:44 - 10:50)
like a disaster and it was uh and then (10:46 - 10:52)
what it was around noon so like two (10:50 - 10:54)
hours after they were still trying to (10:52 - 10:57)
let people in they're like leave the (10:54 - 10:59)
game will work if you leave we're giving (10:57 - 11:01)
you a hundred dollars we're we're giving (10:59 - 11:02)
a hundred dollars in game we're (11:01 - 11:05)
refunding your ticket please just leave (11:02 - 11:06)
and I feel like the people that were (11:05 - 11:08)
like (11:06 - 11:09)
say that was the worst event they've (11:08 - 11:10)
been to or they'll never go to an event (11:09 - 11:13)
I feel like they just didn't listen (11:10 - 11:15)
because because they were because I (11:13 - 11:17)
stayed in the park and I didn't really (11:15 - 11:19)
care that much about playing go I stayed (11:17 - 11:20)
in the park because I was talking to (11:19 - 11:22)
people I was trying to I was recording (11:20 - 11:25)
like little mini segments so the game (11:22 - 11:26)
wasn't working for me at all but like (11:25 - 11:29)
cool uh no big deal but there were (11:26 - 11:31)
people as I was recording and as I was (11:29 - 11:32)
walking around there were just people (11:31 - 11:35)
that refused to leave the park because (11:32 - 11:36)
they were like (11:35 - 11:38)
I'm here and I wanted to work and I'm (11:36 - 11:40)
afraid if I leave it'll start working (11:38 - 11:42)
but literally the second you walked out (11:40 - 11:44)
the gates and walked literally one (11:42 - 11:46)
street away literally literally (11:44 - 11:48)
literally literally one street away the (11:46 - 11:50)
game worked fine you got so many like (11:48 - 11:52)
unknown hair like everything was (11:50 - 11:54)
spawning (11:52 - 11:56)
and it was great and they kept it on all (11:54 - 11:58)
night and I remember walking around at (11:56 - 12:01)
1am doing Articuno raids or Lugia raids (11:58 - 12:03)
and like Starbucks emergency stayed open (12:01 - 12:05)
later because like people just come like (12:03 - 12:09)
it was such a great experience once you (12:05 - 12:10)
left the park (12:09 - 12:12)
and (12:10 - 12:14)
the same thing kind of happened here (12:12 - 12:16)
where Niantic was like the first two (12:14 - 12:19)
hours kind of busted and broken and they (12:16 - 12:21)
were like we're extending it three hours (12:19 - 12:24)
leave the park after six o'clock your (12:21 - 12:25)
experience will (12:24 - 12:28)
be there in the city right but even in (12:25 - 12:31)
insofar as within the park itself I mean (12:28 - 12:33)
right when the event kicked off the (12:31 - 12:35)
first day which was the one of the two (12:33 - 12:37)
days we haven't specifically outlined (12:35 - 12:38)
what the issues were but suffice to say (12:37 - 12:40)
the first day had connection issues for (12:38 - 12:42)
like the first half of the day and right (12:40 - 12:45)
when it began like the 30 minutes in (12:42 - 12:46)
everybody's like oh no I you know I (12:45 - 12:49)
can't connect yada yada they had people (12:46 - 12:52)
on go uh golf carts not go-karts golf (12:49 - 12:55)
carts going around telling people spread (12:52 - 12:57)
out everybody is focused right now at (12:55 - 12:59)
the at the North or the South entrances (12:57 - 13:02)
and I started walking laps with my buddy (12:59 - 13:04)
Tyler and you know when we got in (13:02 - 13:06)
between like the mid one between those (13:04 - 13:09)
two uh entrances on the sides it worked (13:06 - 13:11)
a lot better and so I kind of wish (13:09 - 13:14)
people had listened in that regard too (13:11 - 13:17)
yeah yeah like like I don't (13:14 - 13:19)
there there's not a doubt in my body (13:17 - 13:21)
that they they don't have incredibly (13:19 - 13:23)
smart people (13:21 - 13:26)
working behind the scenes to make sure (13:23 - 13:27)
things are up now the problem with the (13:26 - 13:30)
first go Fest is Niantic reached out to (13:27 - 13:32)
I think this is well documented they (13:30 - 13:33)
reached out to Verizon they reached out (13:32 - 13:35)
to ATT they reached out to these (13:33 - 13:37)
companies and asked them to bring cows (13:35 - 13:40)
cows or cellulars on Wheels and they all (13:37 - 13:41)
said no they were like you know we've (13:40 - 13:44)
had concerts here we've had this amount (13:41 - 13:45)
of this many people watching Bruce (13:44 - 13:49)
Springsteen over by the bean like we (13:45 - 13:50)
don't need that but like the difference (13:49 - 13:51)
is (13:50 - 13:53)
the people watching concerts aren't (13:51 - 13:55)
trying to play a game the entire concert (13:53 - 13:57)
but their GPS on yeah they might all (13:55 - 13:59)
have their phones open or sending text (13:57 - 14:02)
messages but GPS can really jam up an (13:59 - 14:03)
area (14:02 - 14:06)
um so Niantic did try to get the proper (14:03 - 14:09)
cows and cellular issues worked out but (14:06 - 14:11)
they were told by cellular companies (14:09 - 14:13)
that it wasn't needed like there's there (14:11 - 14:17)
they can handle the traffic still (14:13 - 14:19)
obviously maybe 96 should have pushed (14:17 - 14:21)
harder or I don't know like just hey we (14:19 - 14:23)
want to pay you anyways bring it out (14:21 - 14:25)
kind of thing (14:23 - 14:28)
um but their their Network they they put (14:25 - 14:30)
up a whole Wi-Fi network in Vegas and (14:28 - 14:31)
you could see it strong up it was (14:30 - 14:33)
actually like (14:31 - 14:35)
like set up well ahead of time like the (14:33 - 14:37)
wires were hidden like you kind of had (14:35 - 14:38)
to look for it but like almost every (14:37 - 14:41)
single light pole had a repeater on it (14:38 - 14:42)
um (14:41 - 14:44)
and they said that like twice the amount (14:42 - 14:47)
of people were on that Wi-Fi network and (14:44 - 14:51)
it just caused it to tank (14:47 - 14:54)
and some I fixed it uh it started (14:51 - 14:56)
working halfway and for the record (14:54 - 14:59)
um Sunday was flop free like Sunday was (14:56 - 15:01)
yeah it was very solid (14:59 - 15:04)
but yeah I didn't have a single issue on (15:01 - 15:06)
Sunday not really (15:04 - 15:08)
but I think I think why I kind of put (15:06 - 15:11)
this on the level of kind of worse than (15:08 - 15:14)
Chicago is because because not only did (15:11 - 15:17)
Niantic refund tickets give us a hundred (15:14 - 15:19)
dollars tell us to walk two blocks over (15:17 - 15:21)
and everything would work and it did it (15:19 - 15:23)
did actually work (15:21 - 15:24)
um (15:23 - 15:27)
there was two to three to almost four (15:24 - 15:30)
hours where we just couldn't play (15:27 - 15:33)
and yes they extended it but also I felt (15:30 - 15:35)
like (15:33 - 15:35)
it's less acceptable now because they've (15:35 - 15:40)
done so many successful events up to (15:38 - 15:44)
this point so it's like what went wrong (15:40 - 15:46)
well obviously we know what we're wrong (15:44 - 15:47)
too many people connected to the network (15:46 - 15:50)
right (15:47 - 15:52)
so I I have a question I have a question (15:50 - 15:54)
for you so what do you think they could (15:52 - 15:57)
have done because the difference is here (15:54 - 15:58)
right in Chicago they said walk two (15:57 - 16:00)
blocks away it'll work and things like (15:58 - 16:03)
that is that Chicago is a a general (16:00 - 16:07)
purpose uh large city right Vegas is not (16:03 - 16:09)
general purpose so I don't think they (16:07 - 16:12)
felt as comfortable saying leave the (16:09 - 16:14)
park go walk around this trip because (16:12 - 16:15)
there were some families there and that (16:14 - 16:17)
might not be appropriate (16:15 - 16:20)
um also you there was no way to get to (16:17 - 16:22)
this trip unless you had a car true or (16:20 - 16:24)
unless you ubered like I don't even (16:22 - 16:26)
think there was a bus line that went (16:24 - 16:29)
directly from strip to this park yeah (16:26 - 16:31)
and the stuff around the park (16:29 - 16:33)
um were just strip malls and parking (16:31 - 16:36)
lots and like six Lane Highway of like (16:33 - 16:38)
six Lane roads which were ultimately (16:36 - 16:40)
like yeah I don't know if I don't know (16:38 - 16:42)
if listeners know this but like the more (16:40 - 16:44)
Lanes you have in a road the faster cars (16:42 - 16:46)
go therefore when your sidewalk is right (16:44 - 16:48)
up against (16:46 - 16:50)
six Lanes of traffic (16:48 - 16:52)
it doesn't feel very safe as somebody no (16:50 - 16:55)
no and so you know I do feel for them on (16:52 - 16:57)
that end too it's like what could they (16:55 - 16:58)
have done (16:57 - 16:59)
um and I know you and I were talking (16:58 - 17:01)
about this at the event about the the (16:59 - 17:04)
walls situation it being fenced in right (17:01 - 17:08)
Chicago had fences and uh it was it was (17:04 - 17:11)
a safari zone or was it Go Fest where (17:08 - 17:13)
were you at that go fast Berlin oh right (17:11 - 17:15)
because that was within a place that was (17:14 - 17:19)
already fenced right yeah so (17:15 - 17:22)
yeah I guess I guess the the the (17:19 - 17:25)
consensus on Twitter is like Niantic you (17:22 - 17:27)
can't ask people not to come to a park (17:25 - 17:29)
which is true (17:27 - 17:32)
but I don't think fences I don't think (17:29 - 17:35)
asking Niantic to build a fence is is (17:32 - 17:37)
the is a good solution they already did (17:35 - 17:40)
that the first year and it didn't work (17:37 - 17:43)
no no but (17:40 - 17:45)
uh tell the people that are like well (17:43 - 17:48)
the Germany event was fenced in which is (17:45 - 17:50)
true in the I think it's the Brits (17:48 - 17:52)
britzer Garden Brits britzler Garden (17:50 - 17:55)
that is a private park (17:52 - 17:58)
and so it already was fenced in and so (17:55 - 18:02)
for the day of the event so inside that (17:58 - 18:03)
Park there's playgrounds there's like a (18:02 - 18:05)
little water park there's food stands (18:03 - 18:09)
there's uh like um Community Halls right (18:05 - 18:10)
everything you would imagine in a park I (18:09 - 18:12)
would argue maybe a little bit more (18:10 - 18:14)
because it was a very nice park (18:12 - 18:15)
um (18:14 - 18:19)
so when they that Park also had like six (18:15 - 18:21)
entrances and when you went up you (18:19 - 18:23)
showed them that you had a ticket (18:21 - 18:25)
they would give you a wristband and then (18:23 - 18:27)
you would go in and if you were just a (18:25 - 18:30)
normal person and you went up the (18:27 - 18:31)
security guards would be like we have a (18:30 - 18:33)
private event this weekend you can't (18:31 - 18:35)
come in unless you were a park pass (18:33 - 18:36)
holder (18:35 - 18:38)
I I'm sure there are other parks in the (18:36 - 18:40)
world that do this I didn't really think (18:38 - 18:42)
about it but like there were families (18:40 - 18:45)
and old folks and Young Folks running (18:42 - 18:47)
and or exercising (18:45 - 18:50)
that we're not playing go that were in (18:47 - 18:52)
the park with us because they were pass (18:50 - 18:54)
holders and so whether or not there was (18:52 - 18:56)
a private event they pay a yearly (18:54 - 18:58)
membership to get into this park no (18:56 - 18:59)
matter what (18:58 - 19:01)
yeah that makes a lot of sense it sounds (18:59 - 19:04)
like uh like a botanic garden or uh like (19:01 - 19:06)
a city zoo or something like that you (19:04 - 19:08)
know something very similar I don't (19:06 - 19:09)
think there's a lot of private parks in (19:08 - 19:12)
the United States maybe there no no we (19:09 - 19:14)
have some like disjointed we have a (19:12 - 19:17)
botanic garden botanic garden rather in (19:14 - 19:18)
Chicago that's very separate from the (19:17 - 19:20)
city that would serve probably a similar (19:18 - 19:23)
purpose but yeah there's not a lot of (19:20 - 19:26)
private parks in the states we don't if (19:23 - 19:27)
there's a park we're like we want (19:26 - 19:28)
everybody to see that we have a park (19:27 - 19:30)
[Laughter] (19:28 - 19:33)
yeah the other thing about the Germany (19:30 - 19:35)
um (19:33 - 19:37)
the other thing about the the Germany go (19:35 - 19:39)
Fest is there was multiple ways to get (19:37 - 19:41)
there (19:39 - 19:43)
um there was there was a train law there (19:41 - 19:44)
was two different train lines that went (19:43 - 19:46)
one at the South End of the park one at (19:44 - 19:48)
the North End of the park (19:46 - 19:51)
um there was obviously Uber there was (19:48 - 19:52)
um (19:51 - 19:56)
there was a parking lot there was plenty (19:52 - 19:59)
of like bike lanes and stuff (19:56 - 20:00)
um if you wanted to take a bike or one (19:59 - 20:02)
of those like Scooters or whatever yeah (20:00 - 20:06)
there there's like none of that in Vegas (20:02 - 20:08)
it is (20:06 - 20:10)
no there's no infrastructure I mean like (20:08 - 20:12)
just like you said before if you want to (20:10 - 20:14)
get anywhere from that Park really you (20:12 - 20:17)
need to take a car there is not super uh (20:14 - 20:20)
friendly on foot routes to take from (20:17 - 20:23)
large place to large place in Vegas (20:20 - 20:26)
yeah and um (20:23 - 20:26)
that Park was big yeah and it I think it (20:26 - 20:33)
was big enough for the event but (20:30 - 20:35)
it just (20:33 - 20:37)
I don't want to say it was like in the (20:35 - 20:38)
middle of nowhere but there was really (20:37 - 20:40)
nothing to do like there was a Subway (20:38 - 20:43)
there that ran out of bread (20:40 - 20:45)
um there was a McDonald's (20:43 - 20:48)
but unless I'm misremembering there were (20:45 - 20:50)
no food trucks (20:48 - 20:52)
uh at the event there were some food (20:50 - 20:53)
trucks oh yeah the ones in the middle (20:52 - 20:56)
but like yeah like like no there should (20:53 - 20:58)
have been food trucks at (20:56 - 21:00)
north entrance as well and north (20:58 - 21:01)
entrance there should have been food (21:00 - 21:03)
trucks over well what was north entrance (21:01 - 21:04)
there was the entrance by the McDonald's (21:03 - 21:06)
was that north entrance (21:04 - 21:07)
yeah because there was like a whole (21:06 - 21:09)
bunch of strip so there was there was (21:07 - 21:11)
there was like no food trucks besides (21:09 - 21:13)
like the eight (21:11 - 21:16)
yeah yeah there was not enough there for (21:13 - 21:18)
sure as somebody who somebody who waited (21:16 - 21:21)
in those lines for an hour twice I can (21:18 - 21:24)
tell you not enough and they all ran out (21:21 - 21:25)
of water (21:24 - 21:29)
yeah so and there were no water stations (21:25 - 21:31)
either no and I could have sworn the (21:29 - 21:34)
Hydration Stations were marked marked on (21:31 - 21:35)
the map (21:34 - 21:37)
um but I didn't see one whenever I was (21:35 - 21:39)
going around and there were no charging (21:37 - 21:42)
stations either no and well yeah not (21:39 - 21:44)
really and and there were minimal (21:42 - 21:47)
benches and minimal cover except for (21:44 - 21:48)
some trees in the middle but two of (21:47 - 21:51)
those biomes ancient Shores and (21:48 - 21:54)
blistering I love the blistering Sands I (21:51 - 21:56)
know you did (21:54 - 21:59)
was a little bit rough you know if you (21:56 - 22:01)
didn't have a proper hat on or if you (21:59 - 22:03)
wanted to spend any longer than 30 (22:01 - 22:04)
minutes there without taking a break in (22:03 - 22:07)
the shade it got to be a bit much (22:04 - 22:10)
yeah it again it goes back to like (22:07 - 22:13)
they've done these events before like if (22:10 - 22:15)
this was like their first event and be (22:13 - 22:16)
like ah they had issues for the first (22:15 - 22:18)
three hours but like after that it was (22:16 - 22:20)
smooth and Sunday was smooth you'd be (22:18 - 22:23)
like okay no big deal but like (22:20 - 22:26)
this is not their first event no no uh (22:23 - 22:31)
and there will be more events and (22:26 - 22:31)
and even even something like the merch (22:31 - 22:36)
tent there were what two maybe three (22:33 - 22:38)
merch tents there were two yeah and when (22:36 - 22:40)
I when we got when we got there at like (22:38 - 22:43)
nine because everything started at 10. (22:40 - 22:45)
that was like what a 90 minute wait to (22:43 - 22:47)
buy a shirt that's all they had just (22:45 - 22:50)
just one shirt just the the just one (22:47 - 22:53)
shirt yeah I know at the south location (22:50 - 22:56)
the line was so long it almost uh went (22:53 - 22:58)
to the parking lot where people were (22:56 - 23:00)
parking or being dropped off by and (22:58 - 23:01)
people were mistaking that for the line (23:00 - 23:04)
to get into the event right because they (23:01 - 23:05)
you just see the line you're like oh I (23:04 - 23:07)
just got here I must have to win this (23:05 - 23:08)
line (23:07 - 23:11)
um yeah so it was pretty wild pretty (23:08 - 23:13)
wild and so like on the flip side in (23:11 - 23:15)
Germany at go Fest which was less than a (23:13 - 23:18)
year ago by the way they had so many (23:15 - 23:20)
merch tents that there was never a line (23:18 - 23:23)
now granted that Park was huge (23:20 - 23:26)
and uh but like (23:23 - 23:26)
it was like I feel like you you just (23:26 - 23:32)
sell more shirts right like me as a like (23:29 - 23:35)
I could never imagine waiting an hour (23:32 - 23:38)
for a t-shirt I just (23:35 - 23:40)
even 15 minutes I'm like ah maybe I'll (23:38 - 23:41)
come back when the line's a little bit (23:40 - 23:45)
longer yeah and and like obviously (23:41 - 23:46)
you're in line you can still play go (23:45 - 23:48)
you're stuck in that biome you're maybe (23:46 - 23:50)
not getting as many spins or as many (23:48 - 23:51)
spawns because you're not really moving (23:50 - 23:54)
that much but I can't (23:51 - 23:57)
I just can't imagine spending an hour of (23:54 - 24:00)
my you know eight hours of fomo like (23:57 - 24:03)
fear of missing out yeah experience in a (24:00 - 24:05)
line for a shirt (24:03 - 24:07)
but it in in (24:05 - 24:10)
Berlin it was just like (24:07 - 24:12)
oh two people in line great I'll grab a (24:10 - 24:14)
shirt and keep playing like you're just (24:12 - 24:16)
it just feels like you you sell more (24:14 - 24:18)
shirts you make more money when (24:16 - 24:22)
you have more places to just walk like (24:18 - 24:23)
that's the Starbucks thing right like (24:22 - 24:25)
that's the whole concept about Starbucks (24:23 - 24:26)
being on so many corners is people don't (24:25 - 24:28)
want to wait so if there's no line to go (24:26 - 24:29)
in they get their coffee they sell more (24:28 - 24:31)
coffee because (24:29 - 24:33)
like there's no way yeah it's just (24:31 - 24:35)
creating more surface area for sales (24:33 - 24:37)
essentially right and I think you're 100 (24:35 - 24:39)
correct I have another bone to pick with (24:37 - 24:44)
this though too uh so as as a tall large (24:39 - 24:46)
human being right as I am (24:44 - 24:49)
um I always get you know several copies (24:46 - 24:51)
of a shirt or something like that I get (24:49 - 24:53)
a 2X I get a 3X if it looks like it's (24:51 - 24:55)
going big I'll get an XL right because (24:53 - 24:57)
they shrink all that sort of stuff they (24:55 - 25:01)
did not offer a 3X at all for the entire (24:57 - 25:06)
event right and to me that seems like a (25:01 - 25:10)
Miss because while Pokemon go players (25:06 - 25:12)
are active people like to walk and (25:10 - 25:15)
things like that I think at a video game (25:12 - 25:19)
based sort of event having more sizes on (25:15 - 25:21)
both ends of the spectrum would be a (25:19 - 25:23)
good thing to have (25:21 - 25:26)
you know because small small sizes for (25:23 - 25:27)
kids because I don't think they had a (25:26 - 25:31)
kid's size and at least 3x right so (25:27 - 25:34)
you know I think that was a big Miss for (25:31 - 25:35)
only having one item too it's not like (25:34 - 25:38)
they had to stock several shirts it was (25:35 - 25:39)
just the one event shirt so why not go (25:38 - 25:41)
all out it's not like you're not gonna (25:39 - 25:42)
sell them (25:41 - 25:46)
you know so I don't know that that one (25:42 - 25:47)
boggled my mind a little bit there (25:46 - 25:51)
wasn't even like a Niantic Booth which (25:47 - 25:55)
go Fest have had in the past where you (25:51 - 25:57)
know they just sell Niantic merch and (25:55 - 26:01)
and whatnot they had that at the um (25:57 - 26:04)
the Saint Louis Safari Zone (26:01 - 26:07)
and at the St Louis Safari Zone so that (26:04 - 26:08)
was in gosh I can't remember the park in (26:07 - 26:11)
St Louis that's actually a private part (26:08 - 26:13)
um but it's not fenced in it's huge (26:11 - 26:14)
though (26:13 - 26:15)
um (26:14 - 26:16)
I can't remember what that Park's called (26:15 - 26:19)
I went there for the St Louis Safari (26:16 - 26:20)
Zone I also went there for Community Day (26:19 - 26:22)
and the community rained out but that (26:20 - 26:25)
Park huge gorgeous but I at the Safari (26:22 - 26:26)
Zone they had this huge tent in the (26:25 - 26:28)
middle of the park which had Pokemon (26:26 - 26:30)
Center stuff (26:28 - 26:32)
where you get plushes you could also get (26:30 - 26:34)
the shirt you could get the Pikachu with (26:32 - 26:36)
like the the the Fedora or whatever like (26:34 - 26:39)
the Safari Zone Pikachu plush and then (26:36 - 26:40)
they over they had like a Niantic Booth (26:39 - 26:42)
where you could get Niantic stuff (26:40 - 26:45)
so I don't know in my head I'm like (26:42 - 26:50)
Safari zones are like the lowest tier (26:45 - 26:52)
event go Fest are the biggest tier event (26:50 - 26:54)
and it feels like something like this (26:52 - 26:55)
should be in the middle (26:54 - 26:58)
but like yeah not a lot of food trucks (26:55 - 27:00)
no water stations no charging stations (26:58 - 27:03)
only one shirt to sell a great point you (27:00 - 27:06)
made like know where to really sit like (27:03 - 27:09)
yeah yeah which is strange and I (27:06 - 27:11)
understand like you know in certain (27:09 - 27:13)
cities you are dealing with certain (27:11 - 27:15)
amounts of populations especially you (27:13 - 27:17)
know it like in a warmer State like I (27:15 - 27:19)
know when I visited Austin last there (27:17 - 27:21)
was a lot of infrastructure there to (27:19 - 27:22)
help with people (27:21 - 27:24)
um not just staying on the street right (27:22 - 27:26)
and so I know that Vegas Vegas struggles (27:24 - 27:29)
with the same sort of thing but but this (27:26 - 27:31)
is where that sort of stuff backfires by (27:29 - 27:34)
not having seating and and correct (27:31 - 27:36)
levels of comfort with your like public (27:34 - 27:40)
facilities it's a public park too like (27:36 - 27:42)
what we mean by seating and this was (27:40 - 27:44)
this was something they had in South (27:42 - 27:48)
Korea so South Korea was also a safari (27:44 - 27:51)
zone South Korea did not have (27:48 - 27:55)
um any merch so no no merch at all but (27:51 - 27:58)
they had these huge tents for Mystic uh (27:55 - 28:01)
Instinct in Valor with proper seating (27:58 - 28:03)
and obviously those are those are at go (28:01 - 28:05)
Fest as well of these huge these big (28:03 - 28:07)
tents they put up for shade for seating (28:05 - 28:11)
uh for like trading (28:07 - 28:11)
um (28:11 - 28:13)
but also that Park (28:11 - 28:15)
had (28:13 - 28:18)
a lot of ways to get to it (28:15 - 28:20)
they they had (28:18 - 28:24)
um they did uh I think Vegas had Pikachu (28:20 - 28:25)
and Evie come out or maybe it was just (28:24 - 28:27)
Pikachu they did have uh I think both of (28:25 - 28:28)
them yeah (28:27 - 28:30)
um South Korea had that as well so did (28:28 - 28:33)
Germany um but South Korea also had a (28:30 - 28:35)
bunch of Pikachu statues for (28:33 - 28:36)
um photo opportunities and they were (28:35 - 28:38)
like really nice statues I know like go (28:36 - 28:40)
Fest had like cardboard cutouts of (28:38 - 28:42)
Candela and Blanche and Spark and like (28:40 - 28:44)
that's fine whatever (28:42 - 28:46)
um gotta get your dab next to sparkles (28:44 - 28:48)
[Laughter] (28:46 - 28:51)
so all of these events are like (28:48 - 28:54)
slightly different and I feel like they (28:51 - 28:56)
all have pros and cons I know we just (28:54 - 28:57)
spent like 25 minutes kind of (28:56 - 29:01)
complaining about the issues but like (28:57 - 29:03)
all in all like (29:01 - 29:06)
if you if you go to one of these events (29:03 - 29:08)
with like okay the first day of the (29:06 - 29:09)
event might not work but like they (29:08 - 29:11)
eventually figure it out and and then in (29:09 - 29:15)
a couple hours it's fixed (29:11 - 29:17)
like I I still think they're worth (29:15 - 29:19)
traveling to (29:17 - 29:21)
and I still think they're fun like I (29:19 - 29:23)
don't even though I'm like man there (29:21 - 29:24)
were so many issues it kind of puts on (29:23 - 29:26)
the level of first go fast like once (29:24 - 29:27)
everything was working like the event (29:26 - 29:29)
was actually like rock solid and you'd (29:27 - 29:31)
be like well I wish I had more tents I (29:29 - 29:32)
wish they had more food options I wish (29:31 - 29:36)
like the park was not so hard to get to (29:32 - 29:37)
[Music] (29:36 - 29:37)
um (29:37 - 29:39)
but like (29:37 - 29:41)
I don't know I still had a good time (29:39 - 29:43)
yeah one thing in particular I want to (29:41 - 29:45)
call out about this event that I thought (29:43 - 29:47)
was really great was the way that they (29:45 - 29:50)
did the the Spinda uh daily research and (29:47 - 29:53)
the today view uh so just if you weren't (29:50 - 29:56)
familiar with this listener they had um (29:53 - 29:58)
they had Spinda stops eight of them and (29:56 - 29:59)
they were littered throughout the park (29:58 - 30:01)
and one of the one of the research (29:59 - 30:02)
things that you had in your today view (30:01 - 30:04)
was to spin all of them and each one you (30:02 - 30:06)
spun would reward you with an encounter (30:04 - 30:08)
with a Spinda but they were placed on (30:06 - 30:11)
the outskirts of the entire Loop and so (30:08 - 30:13)
if you wanted to get that done you had (30:11 - 30:15)
to literally explore the whole park and (30:13 - 30:17)
I thought that was brilliant I thought (30:15 - 30:19)
that was great yeah no there's like a (30:17 - 30:20)
lot of things that were like super (30:19 - 30:22)
clever yeah you're a million percent (30:20 - 30:23)
right on the Spinda I thought it was (30:22 - 30:25)
like a great way to make Spinda (30:23 - 30:26)
encounter then another thing that was (30:25 - 30:29)
really great and I said this on my show (30:26 - 30:32)
and I'll I'll I'll say it again is like (30:29 - 30:33)
I I hate (30:32 - 30:36)
we saw this with the main Series games (30:33 - 30:38)
so when when sword and shield were (30:36 - 30:40)
coming out and they were like oh we got (30:38 - 30:42)
to do an ad we're we're cutting the (30:40 - 30:44)
national decks like all games going (30:42 - 30:45)
forward we'll have limited pokedexes and (30:44 - 30:47)
we're doing this because like we want to (30:45 - 30:48)
you know (30:47 - 30:50)
craft a more better experience or (30:48 - 30:53)
whatever they said right and the (30:50 - 30:55)
consensus that you saw on social media (30:53 - 30:57)
obviously maybe the minority of people (30:55 - 31:01)
but very loud minority were like uh game (30:57 - 31:02)
freaks trying to kill Pokemon game free (31:01 - 31:05)
Kates Pokemon like like this sucks like (31:02 - 31:08)
why don't they like like our players and (31:05 - 31:09)
I felt like we kind of we've seen this (31:08 - 31:12)
with Niantic too of like Niantic rather (31:09 - 31:14)
cares about Peridot or Niantic is all in (31:12 - 31:17)
on the NBA game or like Niantic just (31:14 - 31:20)
hates Pokemon and I just don't think (31:17 - 31:21)
that's true like you and I both have (31:20 - 31:24)
talked to (31:21 - 31:27)
a handful of people at Niantic and and (31:24 - 31:28)
again I said this on my show I've (31:27 - 31:30)
probably talked to like 30 Niantic (31:28 - 31:31)
people I think one of them didn't care (31:30 - 31:33)
about Pokemon like they were just like I (31:31 - 31:35)
was a job (31:33 - 31:36)
um I'm trying to get more into Pokemon (31:35 - 31:38)
but it was it was and they no longer (31:36 - 31:39)
work there so like whatever but like (31:38 - 31:42)
every like the other 29 people out of (31:39 - 31:44)
30. they just you can tell that they (31:42 - 31:46)
love not only the game but they like (31:44 - 31:48)
genuinely like Pokemon like they have (31:46 - 31:50)
favorite Pokemons they have like I (31:48 - 31:52)
started playing red or blue or I started (31:50 - 31:54)
with like Ruby and Sapphire (31:52 - 31:55)
but like the thing that kind of really (31:54 - 31:58)
stood out to me was like the Reggie the (31:55 - 32:00)
Reggie thing like they put these really (31:58 - 32:03)
cool Reggie Rock rocks (32:00 - 32:06)
in the park (32:03 - 32:07)
um and then on the back was like a (32:06 - 32:09)
secret code to like get the Reggie (32:07 - 32:10)
encounters and that was supposed to be (32:09 - 32:11)
like a fun surprise for trainer (32:10 - 32:14)
obviously that surprise was like (32:11 - 32:17)
ruined because somebody got it and they (32:14 - 32:18)
went to social media before the event (32:17 - 32:20)
even started so it wasn't like (32:18 - 32:22)
ideally the in-person people were (32:20 - 32:24)
supposed to like find it and then (32:22 - 32:26)
communicate it out (32:24 - 32:27)
um (32:26 - 32:30)
but like there are pockets of like the (32:27 - 32:32)
Spinda the Reggie rocks like the Team (32:30 - 32:33)
Rocket tent it was like really cool to (32:32 - 32:35)
see like blue flares go up or red flares (32:33 - 32:38)
go up when like either they kind of (32:35 - 32:39)
messed that up sometimes too but like (32:38 - 32:42)
the the thought process of like these (32:39 - 32:44)
flares going up like there's so many (32:42 - 32:46)
little things then this is why I go back (32:44 - 32:49)
to like I had a great time because it's (32:46 - 32:50)
all like the little things they thought (32:49 - 32:52)
about and whether or not they executed (32:50 - 32:54)
them well that really added to the (32:52 - 32:56)
experience like yeah of course it'd be (32:54 - 32:57)
nice if they had more water stations or (32:56 - 32:59)
more restrooms or (32:57 - 33:01)
um like there wasn't a giant rock pile (32:59 - 33:02)
in the middle that people were climbing (33:01 - 33:05)
but like they did (33:02 - 33:08)
I feel called out Steve I feel called (33:05 - 33:12)
out they did put thought into trying to (33:08 - 33:14)
make like an event that Pokemon players (33:12 - 33:17)
would appreciate not even the go players (33:14 - 33:20)
just like actual Pokemon players (33:17 - 33:22)
yeah I would agree too I mean all those (33:20 - 33:24)
little all those little touches could (33:22 - 33:26)
not have been done by a team of people (33:24 - 33:27)
that did not care or were passionate (33:26 - 33:30)
about it at all and it's interesting to (33:27 - 33:32)
see the sort of extra care that they're (33:30 - 33:34)
also giving to something that's like (33:32 - 33:36)
Niantic only right like team go rocket (33:34 - 33:39)
is their creation (33:36 - 33:40)
um you know they're not using regular (33:39 - 33:43)
Team Rocket assets really team go rocket (33:40 - 33:45)
is specifically different and it's (33:43 - 33:47)
really cool to see them give life to (33:45 - 33:49)
those characters and they feel like (33:47 - 33:52)
Canon Pokemon characters because of that (33:49 - 33:54)
level of investment that they've done (33:52 - 33:55)
for that you know so that's really (33:54 - 33:57)
really cool (33:55 - 33:59)
but yeah I mean (33:57 - 34:02)
to me honestly the biggest takeaway it's (33:59 - 34:03)
all really cool it was cool to see the (34:02 - 34:06)
the bigger volcano again I wonder how (34:03 - 34:08)
much paper mache that took (34:06 - 34:10)
um and it was cool to see the Spinda all (34:08 - 34:11)
the things you listed and there's also a (34:10 - 34:13)
bunch of stuff that were that was there (34:11 - 34:14)
that were really cool that we're not (34:13 - 34:15)
even mentioning there's a lot of little (34:14 - 34:17)
things throughout especially in the (34:15 - 34:19)
research story too (34:17 - 34:21)
but for me nothing is going to replace (34:19 - 34:24)
the the experience of being in a space (34:21 - 34:26)
with other Pokemon go trainers like that (34:24 - 34:29)
like that sense of this is my tribe is (34:26 - 34:33)
really palpable there I mean even the uh (34:29 - 34:36)
Los uh Angelus Ultra Beast event that we (34:33 - 34:39)
both went to as well oh yeah like on (34:36 - 34:40)
paper (34:39 - 34:43)
on paper I'm not sure if that event (34:40 - 34:46)
sounds enticing or sounded enticing for (34:43 - 34:48)
somebody to travel into (34:46 - 34:51)
but in person there it was pretty hype (34:48 - 34:55)
it was really cool yeah you know so it's (34:51 - 34:56)
it's a toss-up you know if you're not (34:55 - 34:58)
the sort of person that likes Live (34:56 - 34:59)
Events then you might not enjoy it might (34:58 - 35:02)
feel overwhelmed but I'm I'm an (34:59 - 35:04)
introvert in a lot of ways and and I (35:02 - 35:06)
this is what I this is what I think (35:04 - 35:08)
people that go to music festivals (35:06 - 35:11)
probably feel yeah yeah I mean like the (35:08 - 35:13)
the I guess the argument is like the the (35:11 - 35:14)
a good comparison is the music festival (35:13 - 35:18)
right like you can go see uh look I (35:14 - 35:19)
could have went to go see My Chemical (35:18 - 35:22)
Romance like down at the U.S Bank (35:19 - 35:24)
Stadium or whatever whatever stadium in (35:22 - 35:25)
Minneapolis they they went to I don't (35:24 - 35:28)
actually remember but like that was a (35:25 - 35:32)
300 experience for like like average (35:28 - 35:35)
seats like I'm sure nosebleeds were like (35:32 - 35:38)
80 bucks and somebody could look at a (35:35 - 35:40)
person be like you're gonna spend 300 to (35:38 - 35:44)
see a band when you could just (35:40 - 35:47)
stream their music for free on Spotify (35:44 - 35:49)
right and I am sure there are tons of (35:47 - 35:51)
people that are flying in and then also (35:49 - 35:53)
spending three hundred dollars to see (35:51 - 35:55)
said band (35:53 - 35:58)
um and I just think about (35:55 - 36:01)
I think to be clear (35:58 - 36:04)
you and I we we paid for our own flights (36:01 - 36:08)
and own hotels to Vegas Yes Niantic has (36:04 - 36:11)
paid for us to go to events in the past (36:08 - 36:13)
um but not Vegas they did pay for some (36:11 - 36:16)
creators and that's kind of like Niantic (36:13 - 36:18)
being like we want we can't pay for we (36:16 - 36:20)
uh everyone but we want to make sure (36:18 - 36:22)
everyone gets like this like experience (36:20 - 36:24)
it I get it I take it as a as a sign (36:22 - 36:26)
that that hopefully that will be an (36:24 - 36:28)
investment in a future event I'm just (36:26 - 36:31)
super excited about this year yeah but (36:28 - 36:33)
but I I spent (36:31 - 36:36)
fourteen hundred dollars to go to South (36:33 - 36:37)
Korea (36:36 - 36:39)
myself right that's how much the flight (36:37 - 36:41)
was uh and then I spent another a (36:39 - 36:43)
thousand dollars on a hotel (36:41 - 36:46)
and I went by myself like I didn't I I (36:43 - 36:49)
didn't know any I don't even know I can (36:46 - 36:51)
barely speak English so I'm like in this (36:49 - 36:55)
country that like I I I I I don't know (36:51 - 36:57)
any Korean right and (36:55 - 37:00)
I think like Japan for For Better or For (36:57 - 37:01)
Worse I've been to Japan too is like (37:00 - 37:04)
more English friendly whatever I do air (37:01 - 37:05)
quotes because like that's what people (37:04 - 37:07)
tell you it's like a very hit and miss (37:05 - 37:09)
for Japan depending on where where you (37:07 - 37:10)
actually go (37:09 - 37:12)
but like (37:10 - 37:16)
going to South Korea going to a safari (37:12 - 37:18)
zone which I would argue is supposed to (37:16 - 37:20)
be a smaller event than what we went to (37:18 - 37:21)
in Vegas (37:20 - 37:24)
was worth it because not only did I have (37:21 - 37:28)
two days of pogo in a park (37:24 - 37:32)
uh I got to experience South Korea (37:28 - 37:35)
and I don't know if I would have went to (37:32 - 37:37)
Vegas because I don't care about (37:35 - 37:40)
gambling I don't drink without something (37:37 - 37:42)
to entice me to go and I ended up really (37:40 - 37:45)
liking Vegas again no gambling no (37:42 - 37:47)
drinking but like I went to I went to a (37:45 - 37:51)
couple shows uh Vegas has some of the (37:47 - 37:53)
best food I've ever tasted granted it (37:51 - 37:57)
was very expensive food but like killer (37:53 - 37:58)
food (37:57 - 38:01)
uh and I I ended up really liking that (37:58 - 38:03)
City because it was great to roll out of (38:01 - 38:05)
bed at 3am and be like I can walk down (38:03 - 38:07)
the street and 40 restaurants are open (38:05 - 38:11)
and I can get a bomb hot dog at 3am yeah (38:07 - 38:13)
and like like it's a really cool City (38:11 - 38:15)
even if you don't care about that stuff (38:13 - 38:18)
so it's it's almost like (38:15 - 38:19)
I would have never had that experience (38:18 - 38:22)
if I didn't care about go (38:19 - 38:24)
oh because he would have never had (38:22 - 38:26)
another reason to go to Vegas right yeah (38:24 - 38:28)
or or South Korea right on that one (38:26 - 38:30)
particular weekend right that was so (38:28 - 38:32)
it's like a catalyst for that sort of (38:30 - 38:34)
experience I 100 agree I mean like I've (38:32 - 38:37)
been to I've been to Vegas before (38:34 - 38:38)
um I had also been to Seattle before (38:37 - 38:41)
right but both of those experiences were (38:38 - 38:43)
very different when I was there as a (38:41 - 38:45)
tourist right as opposed to when I was (38:43 - 38:47)
there as a go player because my (38:45 - 38:49)
priorities are very very different you (38:47 - 38:52)
know but like Los Angeles was a new (38:49 - 38:55)
location for me and I was super happy to (38:52 - 38:57)
walk up and down the the Walk of Fame (38:55 - 38:59)
and do a few things there I think 100 (38:57 - 39:03)
correct on the nose for Vegas I avoided (38:59 - 39:05)
this trip at all costs that's because (39:03 - 39:07)
I've already done it before I'm good you (39:05 - 39:11)
know like see what with with uh (39:07 - 39:14)
La I don't ever want to go back no I (39:11 - 39:16)
don't think so either I did the wax (39:14 - 39:20)
museum I'm good you know like yeah (39:16 - 39:20)
so the last thing I want to I want to (39:20 - 39:24)
talk about is just like comparing this (39:23 - 39:28)
to the worldwide event (39:24 - 39:31)
because shiny rates were not the same (39:28 - 39:32)
um (39:31 - 39:36)
the the hourly biome thing was you know (39:32 - 39:37)
something they repeated which I think (39:36 - 39:39)
Niantic does that well I think putting (39:37 - 39:40)
yeah (39:39 - 39:42)
like changing it out every hour I think (39:40 - 39:43)
is great (39:42 - 39:45)
um but it didn't I think the obvious (39:43 - 39:47)
thing was like it didn't feel like Kanto (39:45 - 39:49)
it didn't feel like Johto because those (39:47 - 39:51)
were only worldwide events and this was (39:49 - 39:54)
an in-person but on the flip side (39:51 - 39:57)
this was free (39:54 - 39:59)
and it was two days and it was the same (39:57 - 40:03)
two days so there was (39:59 - 40:05)
for better for worse like you know when (40:03 - 40:07)
people complain about communities only (40:05 - 40:08)
being three hours and only being on one (40:07 - 40:11)
day and they miss it because of work (40:08 - 40:14)
it at least solves that problem of like (40:11 - 40:16)
if you missed Saturday it's the same (40:14 - 40:20)
thing on Sunday and yeah if you if you (40:16 - 40:21)
can't play in the morning it's the same (40:20 - 40:23)
thing in the afternoon because the four (40:21 - 40:25)
hours repeat and it's free so you're not (40:23 - 40:27)
like spending five dollars and being (40:25 - 40:29)
like well I could only play for one of (40:27 - 40:31)
the two days (40:29 - 40:33)
so it's almost like a I mean it's a (40:31 - 40:35)
worldwide game so like and there's so (40:33 - 40:36)
many players (40:35 - 40:38)
it does feel like niantic's always in a (40:36 - 40:41)
lose-lose position (40:38 - 40:43)
yeah trying to appeal to everyone I (40:41 - 40:45)
definitely do have sympathy for them in (40:43 - 40:46)
this case but there were a couple of (40:45 - 40:48)
things that the decisions or differences (40:46 - 40:51)
rather uh with it that I I felt were a (40:48 - 40:54)
little bit puzzling because it's not the (40:51 - 40:56)
first go Tour event right and for me the (40:54 - 40:58)
most Hallmark feature of the go tour (40:56 - 41:00)
events for Canton for jota was the (40:58 - 41:02)
collection challenge get everything (41:00 - 41:04)
right and that was missing from this I (41:02 - 41:06)
know some people (41:04 - 41:08)
lamented the fact that they had to do (41:06 - 41:09)
that much work for the event in order to (41:08 - 41:11)
complete it and stuff like that but they (41:09 - 41:13)
also paid for a ticket so at that point (41:11 - 41:15)
in time you want to get your money's (41:13 - 41:17)
worth and with this being free I don't (41:15 - 41:19)
think that's necessarily A misstep I (41:17 - 41:21)
just feel like it's having some sort of (41:19 - 41:24)
like identity crisis that's what it felt (41:21 - 41:25)
like for me it felt like a like sort of (41:24 - 41:27)
like a weekend General Hoenn celebration (41:25 - 41:30)
instead of like a go Tour event of what (41:27 - 41:33)
we've been conditioned to expect right (41:30 - 41:36)
yeah I think I think you worded it (41:33 - 41:38)
perfectly with like identity crisis (41:36 - 41:40)
because it felt (41:38 - 41:43)
if you remove Johto and Kanto and those (41:40 - 41:46)
past experiences for a free event it was (41:43 - 41:48)
great but I don't think people can (41:46 - 41:51)
separate like what they paid for (41:48 - 41:55)
before with this very curated experience (41:51 - 41:58)
and be like well this feels lackluster (41:55 - 42:00)
because again I think for a free event (41:58 - 42:02)
it was like pretty pretty solid like I (42:00 - 42:04)
got six Chinese both days and I'd even (42:02 - 42:07)
play all eight hours I and I didn't even (42:04 - 42:09)
really go that hard like because I was (42:07 - 42:13)
like I don't need to tap on anymore (42:09 - 42:15)
um skitties it's fine (42:13 - 42:18)
yeah I was Ill during that weekend so I (42:15 - 42:20)
didn't get to do the sorts of plans and (42:18 - 42:21)
group play that I had originally thought (42:20 - 42:23)
of I was just in my car with my windows (42:21 - 42:27)
up and my mask on you know and it was it (42:23 - 42:30)
was different but I definitely walked (42:27 - 42:32)
away with a fair amount of shinies and I (42:30 - 42:34)
think I played on average like six out (42:32 - 42:37)
of the eight hours uh each day or sorry (42:34 - 42:39)
seven out of the ten six or seven out of (42:37 - 42:41)
the ten right now you know what's funny (42:39 - 42:43)
is we're 40 minutes into this podcast (42:41 - 42:44)
and it's the first time we brought up (42:43 - 42:46)
Chinese (42:44 - 42:50)
because I I think yeah I think a lot of (42:46 - 42:52)
there are a lot of pogo people that (42:50 - 42:54)
Chinese is the thing that keeps them (42:52 - 42:55)
going (42:54 - 42:58)
I hear you I see you like again right (42:55 - 43:00)
now for me I don't want them big Pokemon (42:58 - 43:02)
right I don't care like they're shiny (43:00 - 43:04)
cool but like I like the big I like the (43:02 - 43:07)
small everyone has different things yeah (43:04 - 43:09)
but I I (43:07 - 43:13)
with all the issues of the first like (43:09 - 43:15)
three four hours of (43:13 - 43:17)
Vegas none of those had to do with the (43:15 - 43:20)
Chinese it was just like the the wanting (43:17 - 43:23)
to like play the game it wasn't even (43:20 - 43:25)
like oh I'm missing Chinese it was like (43:23 - 43:28)
I just want to play right right (43:25 - 43:32)
and like whether or not I (43:28 - 43:33)
like I (43:32 - 43:35)
I would even consider the event was bad (43:33 - 43:37)
if I had like two shodies either like I (43:35 - 43:40)
think the event overall was really good (43:37 - 43:43)
it just wasn't working yeah I tend to I (43:40 - 43:45)
tend to separate it in my brain when we (43:43 - 43:46)
talk about on their show of like (43:45 - 43:48)
answering the first question that you (43:46 - 43:50)
that you led with today was was the (43:48 - 43:51)
event worth it and we kind of use this (43:50 - 43:54)
methodology for each event what was the (43:51 - 43:57)
intended way to play versus how it (43:54 - 43:59)
actually panned out you know connection (43:57 - 44:02)
issues and things like that we are very (43:59 - 44:03)
used to as go players especially if (44:02 - 44:06)
you're a go player that goes to uh Live (44:03 - 44:07)
Events or you'll live in New Zealand (44:06 - 44:10)
like you're very very very used to that (44:07 - 44:12)
sort of stuff (44:10 - 44:14)
um but (44:12 - 44:15)
you have to give credit where credit is (44:14 - 44:17)
due and I feel like you're doing that (44:15 - 44:18)
with the global tours that the way that (44:17 - 44:20)
it was designed as a free event was (44:18 - 44:22)
exceptional so whether or not you have (44:20 - 44:25)
an opinion of what it should have been (44:22 - 44:28)
what it was was pretty good and yes it (44:25 - 44:29)
could have been something different that (44:28 - 44:31)
you paid for but that wasn't even an (44:29 - 44:33)
option it's not like you paid the same (44:31 - 44:36)
price and got less it was free and they (44:33 - 44:38)
just changed how the event worked (44:36 - 44:42)
yeah and I can't see them going back to (44:38 - 44:44)
The Johto Encanto ways I know (44:42 - 44:46)
unfortunately I think it's it's very (44:44 - 44:49)
yeah we want the in-person curated (44:46 - 44:50)
experience (44:49 - 44:52)
and again I think it goes back to (44:50 - 44:56)
concerts like do you want to go see Lady (44:52 - 44:58)
Gaga in person and she's going to put on (44:56 - 45:01)
a heck of a show I'm assuming (44:58 - 45:02)
um or do you just want to stream her (45:01 - 45:05)
music and appreciate it that way or what (45:02 - 45:08)
some concerts do do you want to like pay (45:05 - 45:12)
the 20 fee to like stream the concert (45:08 - 45:15)
live and kind of get that like middle (45:12 - 45:17)
experience of like I'm watching it but (45:15 - 45:18)
I'm not there (45:17 - 45:21)
but this is (45:18 - 45:24)
One Step Up from Spotify yeah I feel (45:21 - 45:26)
like you kind of have to like test the (45:24 - 45:28)
waters yourself like go to an event see (45:26 - 45:30)
how it feels you know if it's for you or (45:28 - 45:32)
it's not right like like I I would not (45:30 - 45:35)
be able to hand uh handle a live music (45:32 - 45:37)
event but I would probably go see the (45:35 - 45:39)
gorillas live (45:37 - 45:40)
but I don't know if I'd want to go see (45:39 - 45:42)
like (45:40 - 45:45)
I don't know what's a band oh this is a (45:42 - 45:46)
bad thing for me to lead into now I'm (45:45 - 45:48)
too old to stand in a group of people (45:46 - 45:51)
there you go does the venue have seating (45:48 - 45:55)
and can I sit down that's a 6-2 guy (45:51 - 45:58)
who's a big dude I'm always like am I in (45:55 - 46:03)
your way can you still see you know like (45:58 - 46:03)
but I just I feel like there's nothing (46:04 - 46:07)
that's gonna replace these Live Events (46:06 - 46:11)
but uh the the community okay the big (46:07 - 46:13)
issue that I had overall was the (46:11 - 46:15)
communication of the things from Niantic (46:13 - 46:17)
during this event the the Hoenn Tour (46:15 - 46:20)
event and then the way that those sorts (46:17 - 46:23)
of things fell uh fell apart to a degree (46:20 - 46:26)
after the fact right so there's two main (46:23 - 46:28)
things that we can talk on them brief (46:26 - 46:31)
briefly yeah yeah but the (46:28 - 46:34)
okay great okay cool the the first one (46:31 - 46:35)
was that tweet that they put out about (46:34 - 46:37)
like hey there were connection issues (46:35 - 46:40)
the first day and we had 17 000 extra (46:37 - 46:42)
trainers in the area that cause (46:40 - 46:44)
connection to be clogged right that (46:42 - 46:47)
caused some issues and you can look at (46:44 - 46:50)
this at least two ways probably more (46:47 - 46:51)
than two ways but you can look at it as (46:50 - 46:54)
as one people were outraged and they (46:51 - 46:57)
were like like oh sorry we went to the (46:54 - 46:59)
event that you told us to go to or we (46:57 - 47:01)
showed up here at your events we care (46:59 - 47:03)
about your game so sorry like people (47:01 - 47:04)
just being (47:03 - 47:09)
a little bit indignant about that but (47:04 - 47:12)
the other way you can look at it is (47:09 - 47:15)
even if that's true (47:12 - 47:17)
were was everything done to mitigate (47:15 - 47:19)
that possibility because that has (47:17 - 47:21)
happened in the past right we've had go (47:19 - 47:23)
Fest in the past where more people are (47:21 - 47:25)
hanging out in the Park Seattle was like (47:23 - 47:27)
this and they took measures to limit (47:25 - 47:29)
gameplay in the park and outside of the (47:27 - 47:32)
park and for Vegas they still had access (47:29 - 47:35)
to gyms and Primal raids were in gyms so (47:32 - 47:38)
that was still a huge draw right (47:35 - 47:41)
right so this this is the thing I (47:38 - 47:43)
noticed is when when we were walking (47:41 - 47:46)
around I noticed so many people being (47:43 - 47:48)
like I did this Primal raid I didn't get (47:46 - 47:50)
any Mega Energy or sorry Primal energy (47:48 - 47:53)
it's the same thing yeah which which (47:50 - 47:56)
just tells me like oh that's because you (47:53 - 47:58)
don't have a ticket (47:56 - 48:00)
um that's that's why you didn't get the (47:58 - 48:01)
Primal energy because you can still see (48:00 - 48:04)
the raids now for for anyone who hasn't (48:01 - 48:06)
been to uh uh one of these in-person (48:04 - 48:08)
events (48:06 - 48:09)
and again I think (48:08 - 48:11)
I think you see a lot of people being (48:09 - 48:13)
like well it goes back to what we said (48:11 - 48:14)
earlier of like Niantic telling people (48:13 - 48:16)
not to come to the park (48:14 - 48:19)
while I think (48:16 - 48:22)
that that message was maybe tone deaf in (48:19 - 48:25)
some instances there is there is (48:22 - 48:29)
there is like some truth to it of like (48:25 - 48:32)
Niantic being like don't come to the (48:29 - 48:35)
park because there's no experience for (48:32 - 48:38)
you yeah like like if you have never (48:35 - 48:39)
been to one of these lava events and you (48:38 - 48:40)
don't have a ticket you're going to show (48:39 - 48:43)
up to ultimately a dead zone there are (48:40 - 48:46)
little to no spawns Niantic removes the (48:43 - 48:48)
stops I think there are some stops on (48:46 - 48:50)
the outskirt that are like the park park (48:48 - 48:53)
like the baseball field right but like (48:50 - 48:54)
yeah if we walked over to the baseball (48:53 - 48:56)
field to spin that stop we wouldn't be (48:54 - 48:58)
getting like Zigzagoon or kecleon (48:56 - 49:01)
because it was outside of the park (48:58 - 49:03)
Bounty so like (49:01 - 49:06)
you get there and (49:03 - 49:07)
there's really there's nothing for you (49:06 - 49:09)
to catch I mean you could turn on an (49:07 - 49:11)
incense I guess and like start walking (49:09 - 49:12)
and just catch your incense there's (49:11 - 49:15)
nothing to really spin there you you (49:12 - 49:18)
can't actually like play the game yeah (49:15 - 49:22)
in a way you would so like (49:18 - 49:22)
so I think that's why Sunday is was such (49:22 - 49:27)
a better day because what happens is you (49:25 - 49:28)
have this influx of people that are like (49:27 - 49:31)
oh there's this go event I don't have a (49:28 - 49:33)
ticket but I'm still going to join my (49:31 - 49:35)
friend who does have a ticket and I'm (49:33 - 49:38)
just gonna play alongside him and then (49:35 - 49:40)
you you get 17 000 people or however (49:38 - 49:43)
many people to show up and then go (49:40 - 49:47)
oh this doesn't work for me yeah and (49:43 - 49:49)
then on top of that how do those people (49:47 - 49:51)
leave the park (49:49 - 49:54)
as they probably arrived in a car (49:51 - 49:57)
so like if (49:54 - 49:58)
you know if my significant other was (49:57 - 50:00)
like Hey I I don't I don't care that (49:58 - 50:02)
much about Pokemon go I'm gonna show up (50:00 - 50:04)
I'll just play alongside you and then (50:02 - 50:06)
they can't even play and then what do (50:04 - 50:09)
you do like oh let me take you home (50:06 - 50:11)
right yeah it's complicated I feel like (50:09 - 50:14)
they should have maybe put like a like a (50:11 - 50:16)
free like a frequently asked questions (50:14 - 50:19)
or a functional guide or something like (50:16 - 50:21)
that like a what to expect post that was (50:19 - 50:23)
somewhere that was that was really big (50:21 - 50:26)
just as big as their promotions and push (50:23 - 50:28)
pushes for selling the tickets to the (50:26 - 50:29)
event it's like hey (50:28 - 50:31)
these tickets are sold out just a (50:29 - 50:32)
reminder if you still plan on attending (50:31 - 50:35)
you know the event live here's what you (50:32 - 50:37)
can expect and even if the bullet points (50:35 - 50:39)
are nothing (50:37 - 50:41)
that's still something I mean I saw so (50:39 - 50:43)
many tweets from people that were like (50:41 - 50:45)
hey we showed up even though we couldn't (50:43 - 50:47)
get a ticket but we made a we made a (50:45 - 50:48)
plan anyway and we showed up and there's (50:47 - 50:49)
nothing to do it's like well for us (50:48 - 50:51)
we're like well of course there wasn't (50:49 - 50:52)
it was a ticketed event what did you (50:51 - 50:55)
expect that's never clarified ahead (50:52 - 50:57)
right yeah you're right and like we that (50:55 - 50:59)
problem didn't exist in year two or year (50:57 - 51:02)
three of Chicago which right were (50:59 - 51:04)
um maybe because the first year all the (51:02 - 51:06)
Chicago and Chicago people knew that (51:04 - 51:08)
like oh if we show up it's just a dead (51:06 - 51:12)
zone for us but like so so you get 17 (51:08 - 51:14)
000 people showing up with no ticket (51:12 - 51:17)
they can do raids technically (51:14 - 51:19)
um although they're not getting the Mega (51:17 - 51:22)
Energy they can pop an incense (51:19 - 51:24)
um they can wait in line and buy a shirt (51:22 - 51:27)
they can wait in line and do food trucks (51:24 - 51:30)
they can meet with (51:27 - 51:33)
like they can do stuff but it's like not (51:30 - 51:35)
a great experience and I think that is (51:33 - 51:38)
somewhat niantic's fault (51:35 - 51:41)
uh for not communicating that but also (51:38 - 51:44)
I think I think it's the fault of the (51:41 - 51:46)
park of not being able to leave or get (51:44 - 51:47)
there easily (51:46 - 51:49)
um and I think uh (51:47 - 51:53)
and I think it does hurt (51:49 - 51:55)
this sounds very like selfish but like I (51:53 - 51:57)
do think it hurts the players that are (51:55 - 51:58)
there right because (51:57 - 52:01)
an influx of players ruins the network (51:58 - 52:04)
more people in line like more (52:01 - 52:06)
communication issues in line for shirts (52:04 - 52:08)
in line for food and line for bathrooms (52:06 - 52:10)
like right like Niantic is trying to (52:08 - 52:12)
curate an experience and they don't (52:10 - 52:14)
expect 17 000 extra people to show up (52:12 - 52:16)
and then all of a sudden like what do we (52:14 - 52:18)
do with these 17 000 people like they're (52:16 - 52:21)
here they didn't have a ticket so I I (52:18 - 52:23)
definitely see both sides (52:21 - 52:25)
I don't I don't (52:23 - 52:26)
um (52:25 - 52:29)
I don't know how they fix that (52:26 - 52:30)
um also I've just had terrible (52:29 - 52:33)
experiences in like (52:30 - 52:36)
like Chicago specifically of like trying (52:33 - 52:38)
to trade with people that after 30 (52:36 - 52:40)
minutes realizing oh you don't have a (52:38 - 52:41)
ticket (52:40 - 52:43)
and they they don't tell you that right (52:41 - 52:44)
like you're you're in the trading Booth (52:43 - 52:47)
you're trying to trade like you're (52:44 - 52:49)
thinking like oh maybe it's 18t ah maybe (52:47 - 52:51)
it's a Verizon issue uh maybe it's a (52:49 - 52:53)
Niantic issue like reboot the phone (52:51 - 52:54)
reboot the app all right maybe let's go (52:53 - 52:56)
to customer support and then all of a (52:54 - 52:57)
sudden the person's like oh yeah I don't (52:56 - 52:59)
have a ticket I'm just here and it's (52:57 - 53:02)
like thanks for wasting 30 minutes I (52:59 - 53:04)
wanted to trade you this (53:02 - 53:07)
yeah now that that is really frustrating (53:04 - 53:09)
and but I you know the communication uh (53:07 - 53:11)
snap Foods don't just stop at the one (53:09 - 53:13)
thing whether it was or wasn't (53:11 - 53:14)
communicated even some of the aspects (53:13 - 53:17)
that were communicated like how Primal (53:14 - 53:19)
surge was supposed to work as a as a (53:17 - 53:22)
function of the Vegas event was super (53:19 - 53:26)
unclear for a lot of people and you know (53:22 - 53:29)
if I got the the Ruby ticket was I why (53:26 - 53:32)
am I seeing Sapphire spawns right oh (53:29 - 53:34)
yeah that was me for like three hours it (53:32 - 53:36)
was a lot of people though you know what (53:34 - 53:39)
I mean like it just that the people that (53:36 - 53:41)
that didn't understand that when that (53:39 - 53:43)
was detailed in the blog was a little (53:41 - 53:44)
mind-blowing to me (53:43 - 53:47)
uh so I I feel like maybe we sometimes (53:44 - 53:49)
get caught up in the presentation but we (53:47 - 53:51)
I mean Niantic and not not we as in you (53:49 - 53:54)
and I but like Niantic can get caught up (53:51 - 53:55)
in the presentation of it a little bit (53:54 - 53:57)
but when it comes down to the brass (53:55 - 53:59)
tacks of like what this event is what (53:57 - 54:02)
you can expect out of it that gets lost (53:59 - 54:04)
sometimes and I feel like for an event (54:02 - 54:06)
like this when you're gonna make big (54:04 - 54:07)
changes and things like that and it's an (54:06 - 54:10)
exclusive take at an event (54:07 - 54:14)
not doing so is is anti to the effort of (54:10 - 54:16)
like mitigating those attendance issues (54:14 - 54:18)
of like things being clogged up you know (54:16 - 54:21)
because maybe they could stop from 17 (54:18 - 54:22)
000 extra people showing up it could (54:21 - 54:24)
just be 3 000 extra people showing up (54:22 - 54:25)
because they want to walk around with (54:24 - 54:27)
their friends that's so much more (54:25 - 54:29)
manageable it's like within the (54:27 - 54:31)
hopefully within the margin of of error (54:29 - 54:33)
for what they expected for Server load (54:31 - 54:36)
yeah and I'm sure that there are there (54:33 - 54:37)
were people that showed up that were (54:36 - 54:39)
like totally okay with just popping in (54:37 - 54:41)
incense and walking with their friend (54:39 - 54:43)
yeah I mean that's a that's a good (54:41 - 54:46)
friend if they're gonna like not have (54:43 - 54:48)
this experience and walk in a desert and (54:46 - 54:49)
like be covered in sand after four (54:48 - 54:51)
that's a good friend keep that that keep (54:49 - 54:54)
that person around but like 100 percent (54:51 - 54:57)
I don't know how Niantic I I don't have (54:54 - 54:58)
a communication nature a major I don't (54:57 - 55:00)
know how Niantic is like (54:58 - 55:03)
we're telling you not to come because (55:00 - 55:05)
you will have a terrible experience (55:03 - 55:09)
right right yeah I don't I don't know (55:05 - 55:11)
it's it is like I think you said though (55:09 - 55:12)
too it's a little bit of a lose-lose (55:11 - 55:14)
because if they had said that I've tried (55:12 - 55:16)
like wordsmithing that tweet in my head (55:14 - 55:18)
talking over with my co-host Kyle a few (55:16 - 55:22)
times and uh yeah I don't know (55:18 - 55:24)
it's easy for us to say oh they should (55:22 - 55:25)
have worded that better yeah but how (55:24 - 55:27)
yeah yeah yeah I don't know I don't know (55:25 - 55:29)
the answer to that either (55:27 - 55:31)
oh geez the the second thing I wanted to (55:29 - 55:34)
bring up was the uh the egg Enthusiast (55:31 - 55:36)
bonus that carried over to Global for (55:34 - 55:39)
those of us that had it in Vegas there (55:36 - 55:41)
was this communication on Twitter that (55:39 - 55:43)
the Enthusiast bonus somehow didn't work (55:41 - 55:45)
for people that were in Vegas I didn't (55:43 - 55:47)
really see any of that myself I saw that (55:45 - 55:50)
I I don't have that issue yeah to me it (55:47 - 55:52)
seemed a little bit extreme to just let (55:50 - 55:54)
us use it on global as well because it (55:52 - 55:56)
was a very lucrative bonus (55:54 - 55:59)
like very lucrative and I didn't see a (55:56 - 56:01)
lot of people talking about it but there (55:59 - 56:03)
was a little sentiment of you know oh (56:01 - 56:05)
that's a bummer more people getting (56:03 - 56:07)
access to things that I don't have and I (56:05 - 56:08)
don't even have the chance to buy it (56:07 - 56:10)
after the fact you know (56:08 - 56:13)
so I just I'm curious what your thoughts (56:10 - 56:15)
are on on that because I was kind of (56:13 - 56:17)
like oh this feels a little bit bad but (56:15 - 56:19)
I I appreciate them doing something for (56:17 - 56:22)
what apparently was an issue right right (56:19 - 56:25)
away yeah yeah I don't (56:22 - 56:28)
I think I think the three hours (56:25 - 56:30)
afterwards for I mean they they say it (56:28 - 56:33)
was like two hours of issues I I would (56:30 - 56:35)
say it was like (56:33 - 56:37)
three to four hours of issues because (56:35 - 56:38)
there were Pockets where like it didn't (56:37 - 56:42)
work yeah um I think like going going (56:38 - 56:47)
into the city was like fine but also (56:42 - 56:51)
I feel like Niantic misses the mark on (56:47 - 56:56)
asking their players for a lot more time (56:51 - 56:57)
um (56:56 - 57:00)
without understanding like (56:57 - 57:02)
okay you needed two to three more hours (57:00 - 57:03)
to fix this (57:02 - 57:06)
we're we're standing outside in the heat (57:03 - 57:10)
we're out we're like trying to play (57:06 - 57:13)
and you're saying okay here's here's the (57:10 - 57:17)
three hours back but it's like I've you (57:13 - 57:18)
already you already got eight hours out (57:17 - 57:22)
of me right and like (57:18 - 57:24)
I I don't know I don't know what the (57:22 - 57:27)
what the fix is because like I I I want (57:24 - 57:31)
to get my three hours back in a way of (57:27 - 57:33)
like missing bonuses and stuff but I (57:31 - 57:34)
also want to explore Vegas but I also (57:33 - 57:37)
want to go get dinner (57:34 - 57:40)
but I also like (57:37 - 57:43)
I just I I think I'm speaking for other (57:40 - 57:46)
people like it's really hard just to (57:43 - 57:49)
plan something out and then obviously (57:46 - 57:51)
things go wrong but then to drop what I (57:49 - 57:53)
also had planned off to like give this (57:51 - 57:56)
game more time yeah (57:53 - 57:58)
yeah especially when we just went all in (57:56 - 58:00)
this entire conversation earlier about (57:58 - 58:01)
one of the benefits about these (58:00 - 58:03)
in-person events is exploring the place (58:01 - 58:05)
and if you're like well I wasted three (58:03 - 58:07)
hours this morning in the park and so I (58:05 - 58:09)
want to get my money's worth and spend (58:07 - 58:10)
three hours of my evening doing it (58:09 - 58:12)
that's what you would have done going to (58:10 - 58:15)
dinner going to shows or you know it's a (58:12 - 58:16)
unique problem for us but like (58:15 - 58:18)
organizing groups to meet up and things (58:16 - 58:20)
like that right that becomes that much (58:18 - 58:22)
more difficult (58:20 - 58:24)
so (58:22 - 58:27)
yeah it's I don't that's why I kind of (58:24 - 58:29)
so I kind of think the Chicago event was (58:27 - 58:31)
kind of better than this because they (58:29 - 58:33)
were like here's a hundred dollars in (58:31 - 58:35)
game and here's your money back get out (58:33 - 58:37)
of here good game see you next year like (58:35 - 58:39)
yeah (58:37 - 58:41)
um yeah I don't I I think the egg (58:39 - 58:43)
Enthusiast thing of like okay we (58:41 - 58:45)
restored that next weekend I'm sure (58:43 - 58:46)
there were plenty of people that bought (58:45 - 58:48)
a two-day pass that didn't add on the (58:46 - 58:51)
egg Enthusiast yep um (58:48 - 58:55)
like why it just (58:51 - 58:56)
I think they could have done more for (58:55 - 58:59)
the people who showed up that being said (58:56 - 59:00)
I think (58:59 - 59:03)
I think the event was good (59:00 - 59:06)
but I'm looking at the event in (59:03 - 59:09)
two eight hour spans minus three hours (59:06 - 59:12)
yeah yeah I'm in the same boat you know (59:09 - 59:14)
I walked away from that event having had (59:12 - 59:16)
a wonderful time regardless of issues (59:14 - 59:18)
like we got to hang out for a while that (59:16 - 59:20)
was awesome around the blistering Sans (59:18 - 59:22)
doing laps yeah I was there with a bunch (59:20 - 59:24)
of people from my community too like (59:22 - 59:25)
Tyler was there he hung out all day like (59:24 - 59:28)
a lot of people and you know again it's (59:25 - 59:29)
just great to be around other trainers (59:28 - 59:32)
and I wouldn't trade that for for (59:29 - 59:34)
anything but to defend some of these (59:32 - 59:36)
things on paper is really difficult and (59:34 - 59:38)
I feel like Twitter just kind of makes a (59:36 - 59:40)
Showcase of that sort of communication (59:38 - 59:42)
not working very well (59:40 - 59:45)
right right like (59:42 - 59:47)
it's (59:45 - 59:49)
it's almost like you're what you're (59:47 - 59:51)
reading on Twitter from people that are (59:49 - 59:54)
actually not at the event are just like (59:51 - 59:56)
where did you get your information from (59:54 - 60:00)
sure oh yeah oh yeah like I'm here right (59:56 - 60:03)
now so it's kind of like a perhaps a (60:00 - 60:07)
closing uh thought here what do you rate (60:03 - 60:09)
this event I want two separate ratings (60:07 - 60:12)
if you could a rating for how the event (60:09 - 60:15)
was supposed to go versus how the event (60:12 - 60:18)
went out of 10. (60:15 - 60:20)
I don't believe in sevens (60:18 - 60:25)
um okay okay uh so I I would say that (60:20 - 60:26)
this is probably closer to us I would (60:25 - 60:29)
say this is a six out of ten for me (60:26 - 60:30)
okay (60:29 - 60:32)
and that's based on the experience you (60:30 - 60:33)
had or the experience that you should (60:32 - 60:34)
have had (60:33 - 60:38)
uh I would say that was based on the (60:34 - 60:41)
experience I had (60:38 - 60:43)
um (60:41 - 60:47)
and for me it was again the the I guess (60:43 - 60:50)
where it's docking points is it's it is (60:47 - 60:52)
not even like the technical issues (60:50 - 60:55)
because I guess I'm sure that for me it (60:52 - 60:59)
was it was food it was Transportation (60:55 - 61:01)
um it was (60:59 - 61:04)
the like no tense no seating kind of (61:01 - 61:05)
thing (61:04 - 61:07)
um (61:05 - 61:10)
and it was the park itself was a bad (61:07 - 61:14)
Park I don't know how Vegas convinced (61:10 - 61:16)
Niantic to do this and if you if you (61:14 - 61:18)
look Vegas has a lot of events this year (61:16 - 61:20)
like they're so desperate for tourism (61:18 - 61:22)
and they're so desperate for money so (61:20 - 61:24)
obviously like cities Place bids because (61:22 - 61:26)
they want people to come I don't know (61:24 - 61:30)
what pictures or how they swindled (61:26 - 61:34)
Niantic to be there but that Park was (61:30 - 61:35)
like I don't even know how to describe (61:34 - 61:39)
it like that Park was under construction (61:35 - 61:43)
yeah it was a Giant Mountain of dirt in (61:39 - 61:45)
the middle of it that they had to pay (61:43 - 61:47)
security guards to stand on because they (61:45 - 61:49)
didn't want trainers to walk on the pile (61:47 - 61:50)
of dirt but the pile of dirt was there (61:49 - 61:53)
because they were trying to build like a (61:50 - 61:54)
river (61:53 - 61:58)
like in the the ancient Shores there was (61:54 - 62:01)
no water in ancient Shores it was a (61:58 - 62:04)
bunch of rocks yeah there was desert (62:01 - 62:05)
biome other desert biome and then other (62:04 - 62:08)
desert biome but it had shrubs (62:05 - 62:11)
yeah pretty much and okay the pile of (62:08 - 62:13)
dirt thing was very cool to climb on (62:11 - 62:15)
before they told us we couldn't climb on (62:13 - 62:17)
it because you got up there it's right (62:15 - 62:18)
next to the volcano I got a beautiful (62:17 - 62:20)
picture of everybody in the field you (62:18 - 62:22)
know and they're just like get down from (62:20 - 62:23)
there that's not part of the game (62:22 - 62:25)
experience and I was like I know but (62:23 - 62:28)
okay (62:25 - 62:28)
yeah I don't understand either I mean (62:28 - 62:31)
there are parts of that Park that are (62:30 - 62:32)
absolutely beautiful all the stuff (62:31 - 62:34)
around that like middle I hesitate to (62:32 - 62:36)
say Lake it's like a pond (62:34 - 62:38)
um a glorified sort of pond yeah you (62:36 - 62:39)
could walk around the whole thing in (62:38 - 62:42)
like 20 minutes yeah and that was cool (62:39 - 62:43)
and they had they did have a pavilion (62:42 - 62:45)
there were a couple of things there that (62:43 - 62:47)
were great but the other areas of the (62:45 - 62:50)
park were just so wide open and at the (62:47 - 62:51)
mercy of the elements and in Vegas (62:50 - 62:54)
there's only one element in its Sun (62:51 - 62:57)
um it's it got just to be a bit much I (62:54 - 62:58)
think you're right you know Lincoln Park (62:57 - 63:00)
was cool there was a lot of there's a (62:58 - 63:02)
lot of walking there but once you got to (63:00 - 63:04)
locations they had those vast team tents (63:02 - 63:06)
that we were lacking at this event they (63:04 - 63:08)
had smaller ones that had like all three (63:06 - 63:11)
colors of the flags but no specific team (63:08 - 63:14)
they didn't have like the bean bags all (63:11 - 63:15)
that sort of stuff that we've seen at (63:14 - 63:18)
other go fests in the past so yeah I (63:15 - 63:20)
think you're right (63:18 - 63:22)
see even I would I would put like so the (63:20 - 63:24)
two go Fest I would probably put Seattle (63:22 - 63:26)
go Fest at like (63:24 - 63:29)
really like a 9 out of 10. yeah I think (63:26 - 63:30)
that I think they killed it with Seattle (63:29 - 63:32)
go Fest (63:30 - 63:34)
um I think that like the only thing that (63:32 - 63:35)
really bothered me about Seattle go Fest (63:34 - 63:37)
was the trading (63:35 - 63:39)
and how like it was really weird to (63:37 - 63:41)
trade if you had like flip tickets yeah (63:39 - 63:43)
um and I think the flip tickets was (63:41 - 63:44)
really messy if you were trying to play (63:43 - 63:47)
with certain people like oh like you got (63:44 - 63:50)
morning instead of night and I got night (63:47 - 63:51)
instead of morning like that was in (63:50 - 63:54)
itself a little bit messy (63:51 - 63:57)
um but I think it was it was one of (63:54 - 63:59)
niantic's best events and then I would (63:57 - 64:01)
even maybe put the Germany go fast at a (63:59 - 64:03)
9 out of 10 because (64:01 - 64:05)
Transportation there was good there were (64:03 - 64:07)
so many food options there were so many (64:05 - 64:09)
ways to enter and leave that Park um (64:07 - 64:11)
that Park was absolutely gorgeous there (64:09 - 64:14)
was plenty of places to like sit eat (64:11 - 64:17)
relax shade so like again none of this (64:14 - 64:19)
has to do with like shinies (64:17 - 64:21)
um right yeah it really has to do with (64:19 - 64:23)
like (64:21 - 64:25)
the atmosphere they're like providing (64:23 - 64:27)
and like feeling comfortable and like (64:25 - 64:29)
feeling like you can spend the day there (64:27 - 64:30)
because that's what at the end of the (64:29 - 64:32)
day that's what niantics is asking you (64:30 - 64:33)
to do they're asking you to spend eight (64:32 - 64:36)
hours in a location (64:33 - 64:38)
um and are you going to have a good time (64:36 - 64:40)
in that eight hours and I (64:38 - 64:42)
gosh that (64:40 - 64:44)
we didn't talk about it until now but (64:42 - 64:47)
man that Park was not a great Park no no (64:44 - 64:49)
it wasn't it certainly was enough space (64:47 - 64:52)
but lacking those facilities yeah (64:49 - 64:55)
yeah and even even in the in the car (64:52 - 64:57)
only option like they had two tiny (64:55 - 64:58)
parking lots (64:57 - 65:01)
yeah yeah and the way that that was set (64:58 - 65:03)
up for Ubers leaving and coming in was (65:01 - 65:06)
uh was hectic a little bit uh a lot a (65:03 - 65:09)
lot of traffic yeah I talked to my one (65:06 - 65:11)
Uber driver because I literally it was (65:09 - 65:14)
it was 65 to leave (65:11 - 65:17)
um right at six o'clock also again to (65:14 - 65:20)
reiterate that this park was not nearly (65:17 - 65:23)
set up when it got dark in Vegas (65:20 - 65:25)
it gets dark (65:23 - 65:28)
um and there's no like like Lighting in (65:25 - 65:30)
that Park so it ended up being like (65:28 - 65:33)
pretty pitch black yeah to leave at like (65:30 - 65:36)
six o'clock six six or seven o'clock so (65:33 - 65:38)
it was like 65 for me to Uber out of the (65:36 - 65:40)
park I literally walked across the (65:38 - 65:42)
street to the subway and it was 15 (65:40 - 65:46)
cheaper but it took 30 minutes for an (65:42 - 65:49)
Uber driver to accept my ride (65:46 - 65:52)
oh sure and and so when she accepted it (65:49 - 65:54)
she was great by the way probably the (65:52 - 65:56)
best Uber driver I've had in 10 years (65:54 - 65:58)
absolutely fantastic incredible Uber (65:56 - 66:03)
driver oh okay all right but I was like (65:58 - 66:05)
I was like it took so long for you to (66:03 - 66:06)
take (66:05 - 66:08)
like it took so long for me to get (66:06 - 66:10)
assigned to you (66:08 - 66:13)
and she was like oh yeah in Vegas people (66:10 - 66:15)
will decline a lot of rides because they (66:13 - 66:17)
know what's happening and they know that (66:15 - 66:19)
like there's an event here and they (66:17 - 66:20)
don't want to pick up from it which (66:19 - 66:22)
understandable like when you're trying (66:20 - 66:24)
to pick up in the park like cars are (66:22 - 66:26)
trying to like the parking lot is trying (66:24 - 66:27)
to leave and Uber drivers are trying to (66:26 - 66:28)
get in (66:27 - 66:31)
and it's a nightmare and I was like I'm (66:28 - 66:33)
pretty sure like uber and Lyft punish (66:31 - 66:35)
you for (66:33 - 66:38)
declining or not accepting rides and she (66:35 - 66:40)
she was like yeah they have no power in (66:38 - 66:41)
Vegas because they need us so (66:40 - 66:43)
desperately so we can decline all the (66:41 - 66:45)
rides we want and Uber will never revoke (66:43 - 66:50)
our account because like they need us (66:45 - 66:52)
uh here in Vegas and I was like that is (66:50 - 66:54)
wild that makes sense why it took so (66:52 - 66:57)
long for anyone to accept my ride yeah (66:54 - 66:59)
that makes a lot of sense now that you (66:57 - 67:00)
mention that you know thinking about (66:59 - 67:03)
just the logistics of what Uber drivers (67:00 - 67:05)
do in Vegas you probably want them you (67:03 - 67:07)
probably want them more for for Public (67:05 - 67:09)
Safety if anything else you know you (67:07 - 67:11)
need yeah I mean like and it goes back (67:09 - 67:14)
to what we said there like car you got a (67:11 - 67:15)
car because that's the only way to get (67:14 - 67:17)
around this city (67:15 - 67:18)
yeah (67:17 - 67:20)
um just to just kind of close the the (67:18 - 67:23)
loop on the question I think my score (67:20 - 67:26)
for what my experience was was about a (67:23 - 67:28)
six maybe a six and a half I think (67:26 - 67:30)
that's probably right and for what the (67:28 - 67:32)
experience was supposed to be like if (67:30 - 67:33)
everything went flawlessly and let's (67:32 - 67:35)
just say there was another bench there (67:33 - 67:36)
and like two umbrellas for shade let's (67:35 - 67:38)
just say that right (67:36 - 67:39)
um I would probably give that an eight (67:38 - 67:42)
seven and a half an eight something like (67:39 - 67:44)
that but I would agree that Seattle go (67:42 - 67:46)
Fest knocked it out of the park as far (67:44 - 67:48)
as expectations like Seattle go Fest (67:46 - 67:51)
made me feel like lessons had been (67:48 - 67:53)
learned from previous events and were (67:51 - 67:56)
built upon and go tour Vegas felt like (67:53 - 67:58)
yes it was a little bit different but (67:56 - 68:02)
they went to such lengths to to make (67:58 - 68:04)
them sort of similar to go Fest that I (68:02 - 68:07)
was surprised at the lack of uh (68:04 - 68:09)
translation let's just say that those (68:07 - 68:12)
lessons carried to this event (68:09 - 68:14)
yeah (68:12 - 68:16)
um there were there was oh I guess we'll (68:14 - 68:17)
never know but there was a small part of (68:16 - 68:18)
me that felt they were very (68:17 - 68:21)
underprepared for this event yeah um (68:18 - 68:24)
like I think we arrived in Seattle days (68:21 - 68:26)
before go Fest and you could tell that (68:24 - 68:29)
they were almost done setting up (68:26 - 68:32)
like two days before like oh you guys (68:29 - 68:33)
are like ready to go for this weekend (68:32 - 68:34)
yeah (68:33 - 68:38)
yeah here I felt like oh you guys are (68:34 - 68:40)
not ready to go at all (68:38 - 68:43)
that poor Torchic man oh man (68:40 - 68:45)
[Laughter] (68:43 - 68:47)
inflatable Torchic was looking rough by (68:45 - 68:49)
the end of Sunday yeah that inflatable (68:47 - 68:52)
Torchic was looking rough on hour one of (68:49 - 68:53)
that (68:52 - 68:56)
look I'm trying to throw our boy Torchic (68:53 - 69:00)
a little bit more respect you know (68:56 - 69:00)
yeah um (69:01 - 69:07)
it makes it makes me excited for future (69:04 - 69:08)
events (69:07 - 69:11)
um because hopefully (69:08 - 69:12)
hopefully they've earned their lesson (69:11 - 69:15)
here he would hope again I think I think (69:12 - 69:17)
uh (69:15 - 69:20)
Germany go Fest and uh Seattle go Fest (69:17 - 69:22)
and the South Korea Safari Zone even (69:20 - 69:24)
though it was like a little bit light (69:22 - 69:26)
um (69:24 - 69:29)
they all were pretty flaw-free I I'm (69:26 - 69:30)
sure there's somebody listening being (69:29 - 69:31)
like I had issues (69:30 - 69:34)
I'm sure you did like I am sure that (69:31 - 69:36)
some people had issues but the overall (69:34 - 69:37)
like (69:36 - 69:39)
you know 30 000 people not being able to (69:37 - 69:41)
connect for two hours is is definitely (69:39 - 69:42)
different than like (69:41 - 69:44)
five people having (69:42 - 69:47)
ATT issues yeah something very different (69:44 - 69:49)
very different story yeah (69:47 - 69:51)
um so (69:49 - 69:53)
hopefully they they walk away being like (69:51 - 69:55)
okay this is everything that went wrong (69:53 - 69:57)
and we have I don't know we have four (69:55 - 69:59)
events this year we have five events (69:57 - 70:01)
this year who knows how many (69:59 - 70:02)
um (70:01 - 70:05)
I would assume they are well they did (70:02 - 70:08)
Spain last year I think (70:05 - 70:10)
it wasn't that Sevilla Sevilla yeah they (70:08 - 70:13)
did severe last year so yeah sorry I (70:10 - 70:15)
meant Seville no severe I learned that (70:13 - 70:19)
lesson uh a little while ago yeah so I (70:15 - 70:23)
I am curious how this affects your (70:19 - 70:24)
confidence level in go Fest for this (70:23 - 70:27)
year (70:24 - 70:27)
um (70:28 - 70:30)
I would assume (70:29 - 70:32)
a dedicated I don't know they have a (70:30 - 70:35)
dedicated go Fest team like that yeah (70:32 - 70:38)
that would be my assumption and that (70:35 - 70:41)
team has probably been working on that (70:38 - 70:44)
since the first one ended (70:41 - 70:45)
um I'm not (70:44 - 70:49)
I'm not sure how (70:45 - 70:49)
you know even if even if uh Vegas didn't (70:50 - 70:56)
have the the issues at the beginning (70:53 - 70:58)
there were still Little Things (70:56 - 71:01)
that went poorly like the food trucks (70:58 - 71:04)
like the seating (71:01 - 71:05)
um so I don't know how those were (71:04 - 71:06)
overlooked (71:05 - 71:08)
but if they were to say (71:06 - 71:10)
I'm not I'm not gonna lie if they were (71:08 - 71:11)
to if they were to you know next week (71:10 - 71:13)
say here are the four events one in (71:11 - 71:17)
Germany one in Mexico one in India and (71:13 - 71:20)
one in New Zealand I just literally made (71:17 - 71:21)
those up by the way (71:20 - 71:24)
I would consider going to all of them (71:21 - 71:26)
because it would give me a reason to (71:24 - 71:27)
travel (71:26 - 71:29)
um obviously we both talk about Pokemon (71:27 - 71:31)
go (71:29 - 71:32)
uh (71:31 - 71:34)
and I genuinely like Pokemon go as a (71:32 - 71:37)
game so yeah I used to I used to be the (71:34 - 71:40)
person that would go to at least one (71:37 - 71:42)
packs every year Pax Easter packs West (71:40 - 71:44)
all right technically I guess back south (71:42 - 71:46)
when that existed (71:44 - 71:48)
and I was the person that went to c2e2 (71:46 - 71:50)
every year because I was just an hour (71:48 - 71:52)
north of Chicago it was a very easy day (71:50 - 71:54)
trip to drive down and pay seven hundred (71:52 - 71:56)
dollars for parking for the evening and (71:54 - 72:00)
then drive and then drive back right (71:56 - 72:02)
but after going to those events for so (72:00 - 72:04)
long (72:02 - 72:06)
they they very (72:04 - 72:09)
seldomly change (72:06 - 72:11)
like it's like the same vendors (72:09 - 72:14)
um it's like the same Indie Games (72:11 - 72:15)
getting demoed it's like the same big (72:14 - 72:18)
companies showing up with like their (72:15 - 72:20)
newest hit that you may or may not care (72:18 - 72:22)
about so it's like (72:20 - 72:25)
do I want to (72:22 - 72:28)
spend the same if not more amount of (72:25 - 72:30)
money to go to Boston or Seattle you (72:28 - 72:32)
know cities I've been to multiple times (72:30 - 72:34)
and I do love those two cities to do (72:32 - 72:36)
events that are pretty similar than last (72:34 - 72:40)
year or do I want to go to South Korea (72:36 - 72:42)
for the first time (72:40 - 72:45)
um and explore that City and also play a (72:42 - 72:46)
game I love (72:45 - 72:50)
right so for me like I'm very ready for (72:46 - 72:53)
Niantic to announce more events because (72:50 - 72:56)
again I I I've traveled to these bigger (72:53 - 72:58)
gaming events and (72:56 - 73:01)
I guess I'm kind of over them (72:58 - 73:02)
um (73:01 - 73:03)
and and these go events are (73:02 - 73:06)
significantly more exciting to me even (73:03 - 73:08)
though it's just playing Pokemon go but (73:06 - 73:10)
I think again for me I think it's the (73:08 - 73:12)
travel part (73:10 - 73:12)
yeah I would agree with you on that you (73:12 - 73:16)
know like the the conventions that I've (73:14 - 73:18)
been to I went to (73:16 - 73:20)
um an acen here with my buddy and I (73:18 - 73:23)
think I I think I'm good on Asen but it (73:20 - 73:25)
was a cool experience (73:23 - 73:28)
um and I went to an RTX in Austin a (73:25 - 73:30)
number of years ago (73:28 - 73:34)
um the convention experience to me has (73:30 - 73:36)
definitely lost its luster especially in (73:34 - 73:38)
light of all the sorts of things that (73:36 - 73:40)
have happened over the past few years a (73:38 - 73:41)
lot of other things to consider and talk (73:40 - 73:43)
about in every space and every state has (73:41 - 73:45)
different policies and things right to (73:43 - 73:49)
consider and these outdoor events are (73:45 - 73:51)
just like one of the last bastions of (73:49 - 73:53)
like things that you can probably expect (73:51 - 73:55)
like you can you can have reasonable (73:53 - 73:58)
expectations and therefore expect less (73:55 - 73:59)
surprises when you get there because (73:58 - 74:02)
it's outside right (73:59 - 74:06)
um yeah I I'm choosing to look at go (74:02 - 74:09)
sorry go tour hoen uh both the in-person (74:06 - 74:12)
event in Vegas and the global event it's (74:09 - 74:14)
sort of like I know this kind of goes (74:12 - 74:15)
anti with what we were saying before (74:14 - 74:17)
like this isn't the first one it does (74:15 - 74:19)
feel a little bit like growing pains to (74:17 - 74:20)
me because they were trying to turn it (74:19 - 74:22)
into something different oh let's create (74:20 - 74:25)
this premium curated in-person event (74:22 - 74:27)
very cool let's steal some of the best (74:25 - 74:29)
ideas from go Fest and let's put them (74:27 - 74:31)
into this right which kind of led to (74:29 - 74:32)
someone that is like oh are they just (74:31 - 74:35)
homogenizing these events obviously not (74:32 - 74:37)
with how the global event went right (74:35 - 74:39)
they they're trying to do two versions (74:37 - 74:42)
of it double dip right right and the (74:39 - 74:43)
global event becoming free instead of (74:42 - 74:45)
ticketed and therefore not being nearly (74:43 - 74:48)
as premium a mirror quoting here have an (74:45 - 74:50)
event like if that's the direction (74:48 - 74:52)
they're going I think if the event had (74:50 - 74:54)
gone off without a hitch in Vegas the (74:52 - 74:57)
global event was uh was more explained (74:54 - 75:00)
so that people's expectations weren't (74:57 - 75:02)
um I suppose (75:00 - 75:04)
they didn't fall short of it right from (75:02 - 75:06)
their point of view I think like next (75:04 - 75:09)
year if we get the same sort of go tour (75:06 - 75:12)
um layout and events it'll go that much (75:09 - 75:14)
better because of it (75:12 - 75:17)
so I also have full confidence in in go (75:14 - 75:19)
Fest I'm very very excited for the (75:17 - 75:21)
travel aspect of it but again just to (75:19 - 75:22)
see (75:21 - 75:25)
go players in person in Mass hordes of (75:22 - 75:27)
go players you know it's just it's a (75:25 - 75:31)
sight it really is a sight (75:27 - 75:31)
yeah I (75:32 - 75:37)
I think we both want Niantic to get (75:34 - 75:39)
these things right and it's kind of (75:37 - 75:41)
crazy that this game is going on to (75:39 - 75:43)
seven years old and we still have (75:41 - 75:46)
Growing Pains (75:43 - 75:48)
and that's okay that's okay as long as (75:46 - 75:50)
we keep improving that's cool (75:48 - 75:52)
yeah yeah yeah (75:50 - 75:54)
like final takeaway is if don't don't (75:52 - 75:57)
ever pick the first day of a go event (75:54 - 75:59)
you know maybe maybe if you can only if (75:57 - 76:02)
you can only do one uh you know maybe (75:59 - 76:04)
maybe just do the second day yep a lot (76:02 - 76:06)
of people I talk to are like I'm very (76:04 - 76:08)
happy I got a Sunday Ticket or I should (76:06 - 76:13)
have gotten the Sunday Ticket yeah so (76:08 - 76:14)
yeah (76:13 - 76:17)
um all right well I guess that that's it (76:14 - 76:20)
we plan for uh 45 minutes we're here at (76:17 - 76:24)
an hour and 15. yeah classic classic (76:20 - 76:27)
podcast experience no rag rats uh for my (76:24 - 76:30)
listeners uh where can they find you (76:27 - 76:33)
oh uh well you can find gocast pretty (76:30 - 76:36)
much anywhere so it's g-o-c-a-s-t uh (76:33 - 76:37)
podcast and it's the one about Pokemon I (76:36 - 76:39)
think there's a couple of other gocasts (76:37 - 76:41)
uh floating around that aren't Pokemon (76:39 - 76:44)
related arrest or shirt are they like (76:41 - 76:46)
uber podcasts (76:44 - 76:48)
there's like another podcast that (76:46 - 76:51)
actually also has a Chris and Kyle on it (76:48 - 76:52)
which is hilarious to me (76:51 - 76:54)
um but they talk about just random (76:52 - 76:55)
things and then there was another one (76:54 - 76:56)
that was like a mish like a missionary (76:55 - 76:58)
podcast I don't really know like go to (76:56 - 77:00)
Jesus stuff yeah that's (76:58 - 77:05)
