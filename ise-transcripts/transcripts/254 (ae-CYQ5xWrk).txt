it's super effective i am your host SBJ (0:26 - 0:34)
and with me today i have Travis I have (0:29 - 0:36)
been struggling all week to think of a (0:34 - 0:39)
way to explain to listeners of last (0:36 - 0:42)
week's episode that pocket trumpet is a (0:39 - 0:45)
real thing and not just a funny goof i (0:42 - 0:47)
made up because I sounded terrible when (0:45 - 0:49)
I played the trumpet last week it's a (0:47 - 0:51)
real thing I really own it but I have no (0:49 - 0:54)
way to prove that over this non visual (0:51 - 0:57)
medium you tweeted a you tweeted a (0:54 - 1:00)
picture I did but they can't hear that (0:57 - 1:03)
that's all right wouldn't I think it's a (1:00 - 1:06)
pretty small minority well maybe not (1:03 - 1:08)
minority but not everybody listens to (1:06 - 1:09)
the show as a Twitter either and would (1:08 - 1:11)
bother going on Twitter to see a picture (1:09 - 1:15)
of a to investigate it yeah figure it (1:11 - 1:17)
out speaking of small I have will with (1:15 - 1:23)
us today we all have musical (1:17 - 1:26)
accompaniment now right oh hell no let (1:23 - 1:28)
me pull out my pocket trumpet well we (1:26 - 1:30)
wait wait can you can you do it e on the (1:28 - 1:33)
pocket trumpet um no because apparently (1:30 - 1:35)
it's not in my room anymore I don't know (1:33 - 1:38)
where it is it's so small Travis you (1:35 - 1:41)
lost it apparently so what's steves (1:38 - 1:43)
instrument going to be I I have zero (1:41 - 1:47)
musical talent I know what I find that (1:43 - 1:52)
I'm very believable yes yes you are (1:47 - 1:54)
correct though I believe that you don't (1:52 - 1:58)
have any musical tail there you go you (1:54 - 2:00)
said the same thing I did yeah yeah no I (1:58 - 2:04)
ki I am surprised there's an audio show (2:00 - 2:07)
every week based on how like tone deaf I (2:04 - 2:09)
feel like I am well there's nothing we (2:07 - 2:11)
can do to correct that at this point in (2:09 - 2:13)
time so yeah just gotta live with a (2:11 - 2:17)
fortune good good ol MPs school systems (2:13 - 2:19)
back in back in this voice welcome (2:17 - 2:21)
everyone welcome to another episode of (2:19 - 2:24)
the pokemon podcast I already said that (2:21 - 2:27)
if you are a new listener thank you for (2:24 - 2:29)
joining us I'm just going to do a (2:27 - 2:31)
rundown of what we're talking about this (2:29 - 2:33)
week we're going to get off topic like (2:31 - 2:34)
we always (2:33 - 2:36)
do unless there's nothing exciting to (2:34 - 2:38)
get off topic about then I had some (2:36 - 2:40)
Pokemon news some regarding Pokemon go (2:38 - 2:43)
world championships some other things (2:40 - 2:47)
and then we have a ton of emails I've (2:43 - 2:49)
just been really digging the email (2:47 - 2:51)
segment so I've kind of been last week (2:49 - 2:53)
it was like the longest segment I think (2:51 - 2:55)
the week before that it was also pretty (2:53 - 2:57)
long and you guys have been sending in (2:55 - 3:01)
way more emails than the normal so we're (2:57 - 3:03)
gonna just go through that inbox and (3:01 - 3:05)
tackle those emails and then travis has (3:03 - 3:07)
our poke amount of the week and then (3:05 - 3:08)
we'll end with our house cleaning (3:07 - 3:11)
segment so that's what we got anything (3:08 - 3:14)
new and exciting report on your guys's (3:11 - 3:19)
end ends and yes yes I i I've had two (3:14 - 3:22)
burritos today the Mexican delicacy and (3:19 - 3:26)
both of them were absolutely awful I had (3:22 - 3:28)
a breakfast burrito from district taco (3:26 - 3:33)
and it was yucky and then I had a lunch (3:28 - 3:35)
burrito from chipotle and it was not put (3:33 - 3:37)
together properly and I was very (3:35 - 3:39)
disappointed what was in the breakfast (3:37 - 3:43)
burrito like eggs Barry so I don't know (3:39 - 3:46)
so ah there were eggs their eggs I think (3:43 - 3:47)
I could have had bacon but I selected (3:46 - 3:52)
chorizo and said and potatoes and then (3:47 - 3:55)
there was well cheese it's like one of (3:52 - 4:00)
those mmm cheese peas Gigi's oh no that (3:55 - 4:02)
was one of the my complaints no actually (4:00 - 4:04)
you know what there was cheese but just (4:02 - 4:07)
not enough cheese but definitely no sour (4:04 - 4:13)
cream um no guacamole LA and it was just (4:07 - 4:16)
like so like I've never been to district (4:13 - 4:18)
taco before so she said oh do you want (4:16 - 4:21)
the salsa on top or on the side and I (4:18 - 4:24)
was like mmm I mean I guess I'll have it (4:21 - 4:26)
on top I don't understand what that (4:24 - 4:28)
means because to me a burrito was a hand (4:26 - 4:31)
eating food yeah the old haiyan eating (4:28 - 4:33)
device yeah then it was on top of the (4:31 - 4:35)
tortilla right is that where this is (4:33 - 4:39)
going well it's even worse the burrito (4:35 - 4:43)
came out in a bowl and basically the (4:39 - 4:46)
salsa was actually like a soup that had (4:43 - 4:47)
been poured over the (4:46 - 4:49)
entire burrito what I had to eat the (4:47 - 4:51)
burrito with a knife and a fork this was (4:49 - 4:54)
a breakfast burrito uh-huh in a bowl (4:51 - 4:57)
yeah it was your first time at district (4:54 - 4:59)
nine district taco I would not go to (4:57 - 5:01)
district nine I do not want to turn into (4:59 - 5:04)
some sort of alien creature yeah then (5:01 - 5:07)
what we take some weird turns it's a (5:04 - 5:09)
really good movie but the whole premise (5:07 - 5:11)
of like oops i ingested some oil I'm (5:09 - 5:13)
turning into an alien that fails so (5:11 - 5:15)
weird turn that's what I'm saying is it (5:13 - 5:17)
I do appreciate a lot of that it feels (5:15 - 5:19)
much like a district taco breakfast (5:17 - 5:24)
burrito I will ask chuck was this like a (5:19 - 5:26)
so it's a wet burrito just a regional (5:24 - 5:28)
thing around here or is that all over (5:26 - 5:31)
the place wait wait whoa back what is a (5:28 - 5:34)
wet burrito yeah this is must this is (5:31 - 5:36)
news to me because to me as I said a (5:34 - 5:38)
burrito is a hand eating food and hand (5:36 - 5:40)
eating food yeah not be wet I want to go (5:38 - 5:43)
on record that I don't like burritos but (5:40 - 5:46)
continued Travis yeah so wet burrito is (5:43 - 5:50)
I'm guessing what I am I will admit a (5:46 - 5:56)
lot of ignorance to even Americanized (5:50 - 5:59)
Mexico in Mexican cuisine so I don't uh (5:56 - 6:02)
I just didn't grow up eating a lot of it (5:59 - 6:05)
so here's like the Google search want (6:02 - 6:06)
you to search for what burrito the image (6:05 - 6:08)
search that I'm showing the two of you (6:06 - 6:10)
so it's the burritos great great audio (6:08 - 6:14)
yeah the burritos sort of sit seated in (6:10 - 6:18)
the sauce oh I see I ask because that (6:14 - 6:20)
sounds like what sort of like what will (6:18 - 6:23)
is describing and that air is kind of (6:20 - 6:25)
similar to what i did get as my (6:23 - 6:28)
breakfast burrito but that to me what (6:25 - 6:29)
you're showing me looks more like a (6:28 - 6:31)
chimichanga well no chimichangas fried (6:29 - 6:34)
and this looks like food i got in san (6:31 - 6:38)
antonio which they called tex-mex i (6:34 - 6:43)
think that is a cuisine yes alright so (6:38 - 6:45)
there is a restaurant in Grand Rapids (6:43 - 6:49)
Michigan where I don't technically live (6:45 - 6:50)
in Grand Rapids anymore but basically (6:49 - 6:54)
where I live and they claim to be V and (6:50 - 6:57)
I never knew if wet burrito until now if (6:54 - 6:58)
that was a regional thing or not but (6:57 - 7:00)
this place the (6:58 - 7:03)
uh about what is it called Midwest (7:00 - 7:06)
behind bar claims to be the birthplace (7:03 - 7:11)
of the wet burrito and they have quite (7:06 - 7:14)
the jingle on the radio advertising (7:11 - 7:17)
their their establishment but that comes (7:14 - 7:19)
on all the time on the radio that that's (7:17 - 7:21)
that's quite a doozy do you want to hear (7:19 - 7:23)
it can you play it on the trumpet Oh (7:21 - 7:26)
better I'm warm enough the golden pipes (7:23 - 7:28)
right now oh you're you're you're gonna (7:26 - 7:30)
reenact it all right all right here we (7:28 - 7:34)
go the beltline bar famous mexican cafe (7:30 - 7:38)
it's the great taste of mexico right in (7:34 - 7:43)
your neighborhood and the thing where (7:38 - 7:45)
was the wet burrito at night you know (7:43 - 7:47)
they didn't sell me on this not now that (7:45 - 7:48)
your singing was bad it just doesn't (7:47 - 7:51)
seem like that great of a jingle no no (7:48 - 7:53)
no you don't the bet the thing about the (7:51 - 7:56)
jingle they hilarious and amazing is the (7:53 - 8:00)
fact that they clearly like when you're (7:56 - 8:02)
writing a jingle you write the jingle to (8:00 - 8:05)
fit the words primarily right because (8:02 - 8:07)
you want like the name of your (8:05 - 8:08)
restaurant to be remembered they clearly (8:07 - 8:11)
wrote a melody and then wrote lyrics to (8:08 - 8:14)
it afterwards which you would never do (8:11 - 8:17)
with a jingle because the way that it's (8:14 - 8:20)
accented because of the melody is (8:17 - 8:23)
mexican cafe but you would never you (8:20 - 8:25)
never pronounce the word like that and i (8:23 - 8:27)
find that endlessly fascinating that (8:25 - 8:32)
it's mexican cafe not mexican CAF like (8:27 - 8:33)
you know like it's not how you would (8:32 - 8:36)
actually say the word and it's hilarious (8:33 - 8:38)
to me that you would write a jingle and (8:36 - 8:40)
not think about making sure the jingle (8:38 - 8:42)
it's written in a way that allows you to (8:40 - 8:44)
pronounce the words the way that they (8:42 - 8:47)
are typically pronounced and yet it's (8:44 - 8:49)
stuck with you I don't challenging my (8:47 - 8:51)
brother and I make fun of it like every (8:49 - 8:53)
time we see each other but that's (8:51 - 8:54)
certainly eyes it it sounds like the the (8:53 - 8:57)
jingle for yamaha suzuki of mineola (8:54 - 9:00)
which is a plus let me gallon let me (8:57 - 9:02)
hear let me hear a rendition nope (9:00 - 9:05)
alright it is something that I heard (9:02 - 9:08)
like so many times when I was a teenager (9:05 - 9:13)
listening to you WD re that even though (9:08 - 9:14)
it was a terrible jingle it's (9:13 - 9:16)
I can still hear it in my head (9:14 - 9:19)
20-something years yeah I don't know any (9:16 - 9:23)
jingle 12 I don't know if I'm impressed (9:19 - 9:27)
or confused if if Travis consistently (9:23 - 9:30)
listens to the radio or oh I don't I (9:27 - 9:31)
don't something to remember the last (9:30 - 9:34)
time I have dozen to the radio but it is (9:31 - 9:37)
so indelibly burned into my understand (9:34 - 9:40)
how often they played it and how often (9:37 - 9:42)
my brother and I make fun of it today (9:40 - 9:44)
and I think they still I think I heard (9:42 - 9:47)
it not too long ago in one of those rare (9:44 - 9:49)
instances where I actually was listening (9:47 - 9:51)
to the radio so I think it's still in (9:49 - 9:53)
circulation hmm well I mean with the (9:51 - 9:56)
with a legendary jingle as that why (9:53 - 9:58)
would you why would you take it out of (9:56 - 10:00)
circulation the beltline bar famous (9:58 - 10:03)
Mexican Catherine xican restaurant in (10:00 - 10:04)
Grand Rapids Michigan how would you (10:03 - 10:06)
think how much are they paying us for (10:04 - 10:09)
this ad like how much I don't think (10:06 - 10:11)
anything I mean I don't think the (10:09 - 10:15)
beltline bar needs to pay for that ad (10:11 - 10:17)
has just played so many times that I (10:15 - 10:19)
think it just gets grandfathered in you (10:17 - 10:21)
know Oh IRA dia de Becque really in the (10:19 - 10:26)
old jingle clause mm-hmm not to be yeah (10:21 - 10:27)
I was gonna say that's the that's the (10:26 - 10:30)

it's not good (13:41 - 13:47)
well you're incorrect so it's a (13:42 - 13:49)
fantastic movie and it has a little (13:47 - 13:51)
talking server who's real cute I mean (13:49 - 13:53)
that those movies are more about the (13:51 - 13:56)
legendary trio dogs than they are about (13:53 - 13:59)
so arc I know because they actually (13:56 - 14:00)

I'm not saying the people by the people (16:28 - 16:32)
buying the the Pikachu yellow edition at (16:30 - 16:34)
this point I'm making a poor choice with (16:32 - 16:36)
their money when they could be though (16:34 - 16:38)
when they could be getting an attentive (16:36 - 16:40)
switch with that money maybe they'll (16:38 - 16:42)
argue there is something inherently cool (16:40 - 16:45)
about objects that have very very long (16:42 - 16:50)

that channel last broadcast august (19:05 - 19:13)
twenty-first 2016 all right mmm sounds (19:09 - 19:15)
good I will say my favorite thing of (19:13 - 19:19)
Pokemon day last year was when they did (19:15 - 19:22)
all the movies in a row on Twitch yeah (19:19 - 19:25)
that was I was hoping they were gonna do (19:22 - 19:28)
that again this year but it out of the (19:25 - 19:30)
what 12 bullet points i read you that's (19:28 - 19:33)
that's not an option but i might stream (19:30 - 19:36)
something pokemon related on pokemon day (19:33 - 19:39)
to stream all the pokemon movies yeah (19:36 - 19:41)
yeah sure i'm will care I'm (19:39 - 19:44)
sure that'll be fine right having a (19:41 - 19:47)
Nintendo as it I've realized this (19:44 - 19:49)
pokemon company but Nintendo in general (19:47 - 19:50)
has been pretty lenient with that sort (19:49 - 19:53)
of thing yeah yeah they what they want (19:50 - 19:54)
as much pokemon out there as possible (19:53 - 19:57)
right yeah uh yeah I might I might do (19:54 - 19:59)
something I'm poke Monday twitch related (19:57 - 20:02)
or or or something else but it's cool (19:59 - 20:04)
it's mainly I pull out that Pokemon dual (20:02 - 20:06)
stream you've been teasin for so long I (20:04 - 20:08)
thought about it yeah I still have not (20:06 - 20:10)
opened the app so it's still super super (20:08 - 20:12)
fresh to me it is cool that they are (20:10 - 20:14)
doing this again I'm glad this wasn't (20:12 - 20:17)
just like a one-off thing that okay this (20:14 - 20:19)
is the second year they're doing Pokemon (20:17 - 20:22)
day and yeah it's not as great as last (20:19 - 20:23)
year but (20:22 - 20:25)
we they they continued doing it because (20:23 - 20:29)
I do think it's a great reminder and the (20:25 - 20:31)
most wonderful time of the year and (20:29 - 20:33)
business-wise if they're if they're (20:31 - 20:35)
doing as much stuff as they are here and (20:33 - 20:37)
they're doing that every year that's (20:35 - 20:41)
that's enough to hit websites or other (20:37 - 20:43)
publications that maybe normally don't (20:41 - 20:45)
report about Pokemon to report about (20:43 - 20:46)
Pokemon than which in terms reminds (20:45 - 20:50)
people that Pokemon exists because oh oh (20:46 - 20:52)
that just brought something to mine yeah (20:50 - 20:55)
um the digit I don't know if you guys (20:52 - 20:57)
knew but like Geico is sponsoring a (20:55 - 21:00)
tournament of champions of Pokemon VGC (20:57 - 21:02)
right now as we speak we're yes we're in (21:00 - 21:05)
this yes and in their advertisement for (21:02 - 21:09)
it they literally said due to the recent (21:05 - 21:12)
return of popularity of Pokemon we're (21:09 - 21:15)
holding this tournament while what what (21:12 - 21:18)
what do you mean like pretty reported (21:15 - 21:21)
clarity there were there late by 12 (21:18 - 21:24)
months like I would send Pokemon was way (21:21 - 21:29)
papi way more popular in July of 2016 (21:24 - 21:33)
than it is today februari 25th whenever (21:29 - 21:35)
rapport decides that pokemon x and y are (21:33 - 21:39)
among the top selling pokemon titles i (21:35 - 21:42)
think was sun and moon past it well (21:39 - 21:45)
great for sun and moon but still x and y (21:42 - 21:47)
did not do poorly and that's like three (21:45 - 21:49)
and a half years ago no i think sun and (21:47 - 21:51)
moon past Omega Ruby office a fire at (21:49 - 21:54)
this point but easily done yeah I mean (21:51 - 21:57)
projection wise sun and moon looks like (21:54 - 22:00)
it's going to outsell everything but the (21:57 - 22:03)
the the first two games yeah I don't (22:00 - 22:06)
know ie I think the the pokemon go joto (22:03 - 22:09)
definitely rekindled some interest in (22:06 - 22:13)
people but obviously the hype around Sun (22:09 - 22:15)
and Moon definitely helped but I would (22:13 - 22:18)
argue that Pokemon has kind of been a (22:15 - 22:21)
slight decline since then and obviously (22:18 - 22:22)
if you're in the competitive scene if (22:21 - 22:24)
you're if you're in the TCG or you're (22:22 - 22:27)
playing competitive Sun and Moon you're (22:24 - 22:29)
not seeing that but if you're just a (22:27 - 22:32)
casual player maybe you completed your (22:29 - 22:33)
pokedex by now there's not really that (22:32 - 22:37)
much to do maybe I'm (22:33 - 22:39)
you want to switch over to go and catch (22:37 - 22:42)
some johto pokemon but spirit we mean if (22:39 - 22:43)
you're outside of the Pokemon bubble (22:42 - 22:46)
maybe but speaking on a place that I (22:43 - 22:49)
live oh god the competitive scene (22:46 - 22:53)
locations and dates for the 2017 north (22:49 - 22:55)
american international championships in (22:53 - 22:57)
2017 World Championships have been (22:55 - 22:59)

june thirtieth through july second at (23:01 - 23:06)
the indiana convention center in (23:04 - 23:08)
indianapolis it looks like they moved (23:06 - 23:10)
back to Indiana last year i believe we (23:08 - 23:13)
were at the oh ha the cleveland ohio (23:10 - 23:16)
columbus ohio convention center so i (23:13 - 23:18)
wonder what that was all about there (23:16 - 23:19)
must think they probably just couldn't (23:18 - 23:21)
book those dates right and they had to (23:19 - 23:23)
move somewhere else I mean is maybe a (23:21 - 23:25)
little price difference or when none of (23:23 - 23:28)
us went right so I I couldn't tell you (23:25 - 23:30)
if I couldn't tell you if that venue was (23:28 - 23:32)
bigger or smaller or maybe just didn't (23:30 - 23:34)
work out for them maybe it was cheaper (23:32 - 23:36)
and they went and we're like as in the (23:34 - 23:38)
same working we can't fit our inflatable (23:36 - 23:42)
Pikachu through the the side door here I (23:38 - 23:43)

the wrong way at like evo right yeah i (25:32 - 25:38)
was at evo there was there was some (25:36 - 25:41)
bidding thing where people were donating (25:38 - 25:43)
to get poked in at a future tournament (25:41 - 25:46)
i'm not sure which one that was but it (25:43 - 25:48)
did raise quite a bit of money and i (25:46 - 25:50)
think they are including it at i don't (25:48 - 25:53)
want to say it's evo it could be but i (25:50 - 25:55)
don't i know i'd be wrong with whatever (25:53 - 25:57)
would come out of my mouth but yeah (25:55 - 25:59)
they're the people who are playing that (25:57 - 26:01)
are still into that I mean you could say (25:59 - 26:03)
like is there still a street fighter 4 (26:01 - 26:05)
audience and yes there is for that game (26:03 - 26:07)
in street fighter 5 and killer instinct (26:05 - 26:11)
him oh like all those other fighting (26:07 - 26:13)
game people have their their definite (26:11 - 26:16)
niche of we're gonna continue playing (26:13 - 26:17)
this game and get getting good at it (26:16 - 26:19)
well I mean that's the thing right (26:17 - 26:20)
forever for the fighting games people (26:19 - 26:23)
like specialize in a particular fighting (26:20 - 26:24)
game get really good at it and then they (26:23 - 26:27)
go and compete so they don't care (26:24 - 26:29)
whether it's popular with the casual (26:27 - 26:31)
populace they just care whether they can (26:29 - 26:33)
actually continue to play it (26:31 - 26:34)
competitively even though there hasn't (26:33 - 26:37)
been an update for it in about a year (26:34 - 26:40)
yeah I want to say well what is that (26:37 - 26:41)
that game's going to be two years old (26:40 - 26:44)
this year right 201 it's over a year old (26:41 - 26:46)
it's definitely over a year old so yeah (26:44 - 26:47)
it's good asked me two years old I (26:46 - 26:50)
looked this up because I was on I was (26:47 - 26:52)
oddly poking subreddit about two weeks (26:50 - 26:55)
ago when they were talking about the (26:52 - 26:57)
future of pokin somebody was talking (26:55 - 26:59)
about the update i looked it up in the (26:57 - 27:02)
last update was like six or eight months (26:59 - 27:04)
ago it was it was quite a while ago but (27:02 - 27:07)
I think the game came out in October of (27:04 - 27:11)
2015 wow I pretty sure it came out in (27:07 - 27:14)
march of whatever it definitely didn't (27:11 - 27:16)
come out in March will look it up well (27:14 - 27:19)
look check the wiki it came out July (27:16 - 27:23)
sixteenth 2015 so older that I thought (27:19 - 27:25)
it was Wow wait wait wait what's that (27:23 - 27:28)
Japan or us just what the quick link (27:25 - 27:31)
from wiki said here we go we you as (27:28 - 27:37)
March 18 2016 Japan vindicated yeah good (27:31 - 27:40)
poll will march 18 yes it's not a year (27:37 - 27:42)
old hey heard of your first boom no (27:40 - 27:46)
that's not the first time you first (27:42 - 27:46)
alrighty of you planning on going to the (27:46 - 27:53)
Nationals or well I guess you can't go (27:50 - 27:54)
to words unless you're invited but are (27:53 - 27:57)
you guys thinking of going the Nationals (27:54 - 27:59)
it's a tough call for me because (27:57 - 28:03)
bushiroad is having a what they call a (27:59 - 28:05)
grand fest which they typically only do (28:03 - 28:08)
in Japan they're actually having one in (28:05 - 28:12)
their california area the same weekend (28:08 - 28:14)
would you like July 4th weekend and I (28:12 - 28:16)
can't do both and that's like a really (28:14 - 28:20)
rare opportunity type thing that that's (28:16 - 28:23)
happening so i'll probably end up not (28:20 - 28:26)
going to either but it's a it's a tough (28:23 - 28:28)
call because yeah that's either a second (28:26 - 28:30)
drive to Indianapolis right I can't (28:28 - 28:34)
drive to what at Long Beach Long Beach (28:30 - 28:36)
California that's where the Vanguard one (28:34 - 28:39)
is gonna be gotta fly yeah but airplanes (28:36 - 28:42)
cost a lot of money and son as you know (28:39 - 28:44)
I was explaining to Travis you know in (28:42 - 28:46)
about four days I will not have any (28:44 - 28:49)
legal documentation proving that i can (28:46 - 28:53)

July weekend and gen cons always end of (29:19 - 29:24)
July or August you beginning of august (29:22 - 29:27)
early August so it's very hard to take a (29:24 - 29:30)
trip down to Indiana twice in such a yes (29:27 - 29:33)
time yeah especially based on how (29:30 - 29:37)
expensive gent ganas sure but yeah if I (29:33 - 29:40)
mean I don't I don't think enough of my (29:37 - 29:43)
pokey pals are gonna be heading down (29:40 - 29:46)
there and it's not really that rad of a (29:43 - 29:49)
time to just be like hey I'm here by (29:46 - 29:53)
myself playing yeah the pocket monsters (29:49 - 29:56)
because I'm not good right like it it (29:53 - 29:58)
would be worth it if I were just really (29:56 - 30:00)
good and actually had a shot but i don't (29:58 - 30:02)

York weird it seems like you would just (31:31 - 31:37)
do all gentle Jen's Evan yeah final (31:32 - 31:41)
article here is a polygon calm pokemon (31:37 - 31:44)
chief says approach to games needs to (31:41 - 31:48)
change if brought to switch me read the (31:44 - 31:49)
article real quick the pokemon company (31:48 - 31:52)
confirmed instant in September it would (31:49 - 31:54)
be supporting the Nintendo switch in an (31:52 - 31:58)
interview CEO ishihara said the company (31:54 - 32:00)
would need to rethink on how it handles (31:58 - 32:02)
titles on the system if it decides to (32:00 - 32:04)
incorporate the new technology ishihara (32:02 - 32:06)
sat down with Japanese business and (32:04 - 32:10)
technology website Tokyo zakia online to (32:06 - 32:12)
discuss the future of Pokemon including (32:10 - 32:15)
Pokemon go and new games on switch when (32:12 - 32:17)
asked how the pokemon company who was (32:15 - 32:19)
looking to get involved with nintendo's (32:17 - 32:23)
new console ishihara suggested the way (32:19 - 32:24)
the company approaches designing its (32:23 - 32:26)
main title games like Pokemon Sun and (32:24 - 32:28)
Moon would have to change if the new (32:26 - 32:31)
console was incorporated Pokemon has (32:28 - 32:33)
been about being portable and now there (32:31 - 32:35)
is the switch which is a portable home (32:33 - 32:37)
console so it has a bigger screen and (32:35 - 32:39)
higher specs than we're used to ishihara (32:37 - 32:42)
said as translated by neogaf somebody (32:39 - 32:45)
apart from the main games we make stuff (32:42 - 32:48)
like pokin and pokemon mystery dungeon (32:45 - 32:50)
so i am thinking that we should make a (32:48 - 32:53)
game that suits the switch but at this (32:50 - 32:55)
time i cannot confirm any projects (32:53 - 32:57)
ishihara added that if they were to (32:55 - 33:00)
develop a game if they were to develop (32:57 - 33:01)
games primary for the switch it would (33:00 - 33:03)
have to be different from the way (33:01 - 33:05)
they've handled making portable games in (33:03 - 33:07)
the past but it wouldn't be elaborate (33:05 - 33:10)
but up sir but wouldn't elaborate it (33:07 - 33:13)
it's still unclear if the company (33:10 - 33:15)
intends to release get a game like (33:13 - 33:17)
pokemon sun or moon for the console the (33:15 - 33:20)
switch may act like a gamecube wii or (33:17 - 33:22)
wii u in the in which became the go-to (33:20 - 33:24)
consoles for offshoot pokemon titles (33:22 - 33:26)
like pokemon rumble pokemon (33:24 - 33:28)
our revolution and pokepark wii (33:26 - 33:31)
Pikachu's adventure it was rumored last (33:28 - 33:33)
year that a game codenamed Pokemon stars (33:31 - 33:36)
which would act as the third iteration (33:33 - 33:38)
of Pokemon Sun and Moon would boot would (33:36 - 33:42)
be released mid-2017 but the pokemon (33:38 - 33:44)
company hasn't confirmed those rumors (33:42 - 33:47)
more information is to be expected to be (33:44 - 33:48)
released by the pokemon company (33:47 - 33:50)
throughout the year about what its plans (33:48 - 33:52)
are for bringing Pokemon games to the (33:50 - 33:54)
console so there's your article I think (33:52 - 33:55)
we've talked about this a little bit (33:54 - 33:57)
there was I know there was a (33:55 - 33:59)
conversation last week where we said (33:57 - 34:02)
where I said that every studio every (33:59 - 34:05)
Nintendo studio is making a game for (34:02 - 34:07)
switch that was confirmed by somebody at (34:05 - 34:10)
Nintendo but I think try think Travis (34:07 - 34:12)
asked if that included the pokemon (34:10 - 34:14)
company I said I'm pretty sure it did (34:12 - 34:17)
but now we have confirmation that they (34:14 - 34:19)
are making something they just haven't (34:17 - 34:22)
said what and it's gonna be different (34:19 - 34:26)
than anything we've seen before hahaha (34:22 - 34:29)
it all comes together and Pokemon Sun (34:26 - 34:32)
and Moon I mean I mean we like the (34:29 - 34:34)
switch to me is like a bigger game boy (34:32 - 34:37)
advance right there was the game boy (34:34 - 34:41)
advance to the the 3ds or to the DS I'm (34:37 - 34:43)
sorry to the d/s was more of a (34:41 - 34:47)
dramatical change then just going back (34:43 - 34:50)
to us a switch at this point it's just (34:47 - 34:52)
one screen that's bigger it worked it (34:50 - 34:56)
worked yeah so my curiosity is more (34:52 - 34:59)
around the wireless interactivity and (34:56 - 35:03)
like does the switch have the ability to (34:59 - 35:06)
do like local battles you can connect a (35:03 - 35:09)
seven other consoles that's true that's (35:06 - 35:10)
a tour that's true all right so then the (35:09 - 35:13)
real question becomes are we going to (35:10 - 35:17)
have a Barry mixing mashing some sort of (35:13 - 35:20)
contest using the joy cons I want to (35:17 - 35:24)
feel the berries as I smash them into (35:20 - 35:26)
pokeball that HD Rumble up on those (35:24 - 35:29)
berries yes this is the most important (35:26 - 35:32)
feature of that must come out of the (35:29 - 35:36)
whole research of the pokemon company (35:32 - 35:38)
gamefreak get on those berries well (35:36 - 35:40)
Pokemon normally shows something off (35:38 - 35:43)
around March for the year what if the (35:40 - 35:45)
joy can actually makes you feel like (35:43 - 35:48)
you're throwing a pokeball want that HD (35:45 - 35:50)
Rumble I mean you can feel an ice cube (35:48 - 35:51)
you might as well be able to feel a (35:50 - 35:57)
pokeball yeah yup you sold me yeah I (35:51 - 36:02)
don't know what to really expect the the (35:57 - 36:05)
the rumored game pokemon stars was was (36:02 - 36:08)
reported by Eurogamer which reported (36:05 - 36:11)
pretty much everything correctly on (36:08 - 36:13)
switch more or less i'm sure they got (36:11 - 36:15)
one or two things wrong but they got (36:13 - 36:17)
more things right than wrong so that's (36:15 - 36:19)
the only reason I really believe the (36:17 - 36:23)
Stars thing also my reasoning for that (36:19 - 36:26)
making a little more sense was just the (36:23 - 36:31)
fact of how poorly Sun and Moon ran on (36:26 - 36:35)
the new 3ds XL and you know some people (36:31 - 36:36)
didn't have problems with that but I (36:35 - 36:40)
think any any battles with the ultra (36:36 - 36:42)
beast really made the system chug a bit (36:40 - 36:45)
and the other thing that kind of really (36:42 - 36:48)
sold me on this whole concept was how (36:45 - 36:50)
high the actual character in pokemon (36:48 - 36:53)
models are outside the game when people (36:50 - 36:55)
pulled the source code and and upper as (36:53 - 36:58)
them and how clean and and great they (36:55 - 37:00)
looked and so just seemed like they were (36:58 - 37:02)
developing a game for a more powerful (37:00 - 37:05)
piece of hardware that didn't exist (37:02 - 37:08)
until you know six days from now how (37:05 - 37:12)
wild is our said mmm switch comes out on (37:08 - 37:15)
March third yeah it's it's exciting and (37:12 - 37:18)
it's it's yeah like you said it's wild (37:15 - 37:20)
to think about that well it's exciting (37:18 - 37:22)
for people who are getting one and then (37:20 - 37:23)
those of us will be sitting in a corner (37:22 - 37:26)
crying playing Monster Hunter iteration (37:23 - 37:28)
yeah well you said you're not getting (37:26 - 37:30)
one because there was there was no (37:28 - 37:32)
monster hunter or no pokemon right I (37:30 - 37:35)
mean it yeah there's nothing like if I (37:32 - 37:38)
had like lots of money just hanging out (37:35 - 37:39)
in the bank where it's doing me (37:38 - 37:41)
absolutely no good then yes I would have (37:39 - 37:43)
gotten a launch day switch but seeing as (37:41 - 37:46)
I actually have a family to feed and a (37:43 - 37:48)
house to maintain that drains my (37:46 - 37:49)
resources (37:48 - 37:51)
I'm going to wait for there to be a more (37:49 - 37:53)
compelling reason for me to get the (37:51 - 37:55)
switch unless somebody got it for me for (37:53 - 37:56)
my birthday and is not telling me and (37:55 - 37:58)
it's gonna be a huge surprise hooray (37:56 - 38:00)
that'd be exciting Travis you're not (37:58 - 38:03)
you're still running with your 20 year (38:00 - 38:07)
old 3ds so that is correct I the closer (38:03 - 38:09)
I get to the launch of the switch the (38:07 - 38:12)
more I am tempted to actually get it I I (38:09 - 38:15)
never get things on launch day but for (38:12 - 38:17)
some reason I don't know why this which (38:15 - 38:21)
is the one that's bad that is more (38:17 - 38:23)
tempting than things usually are for me (38:21 - 38:26)
but something about maybe I maybe I just (38:23 - 38:29)
need something spice up my life right (38:26 - 38:34)
now and I I don't have no wow certain (38:29 - 38:36)
Mars I guess I'm just gonna get really (38:34 - 38:38)
into arms I don't know part of me (38:36 - 38:41)
there's an angel and a devil on my (38:38 - 38:43)
shoulders one of them is telling me to (38:41 - 38:45)
get the switch and the other is telling (38:43 - 38:47)
me not to do it so I'm stolen I just (38:45 - 38:50)
analysis I would be concerned on your (38:47 - 38:52)
part whether the switch will actually (38:50 - 38:53)
work with the Canadian version of (38:52 - 38:56)
electricity you know it's just (38:53 - 38:59)
electricity up there that's what you (38:56 - 39:01)
would like to be yeah that's what (38:59 - 39:03)
they're trying to pit so slowly okay (39:01 - 39:04)
where they have different outlets (39:03 - 39:08)
remember that documentary where they had (39:04 - 39:10)
the elephant that was filmed in Canada (39:08 - 39:13)
what are you talking about I was a (39:10 - 39:15)
throwback to last week's episode well (39:13 - 39:19)
test Tesla vers Edison oh yeah elephant (39:15 - 39:23)
scandal speaking of the speaking of (39:19 - 39:24)
scandals what we're gonna do is we're (39:23 - 39:27)

trumpet can you figure out why I'm (39:47 - 39:51)
playing the trumpet (39:50 - 39:53)
[Music] (39:51 - 40:05)
I love the trumpet all the trumpet the (39:53 - 40:07)
soundfont of generation 3 is very (40:05 - 40:09)
different than the previous games and (40:07 - 40:11)
has a lot of loss emphasized mourns in (40:09 - 40:19)
it so that's joke I play the trumpet and (40:11 - 40:24)
we are back from our break let's tackle (40:19 - 40:27)

calm and hit that contact button and (40:53 - 40:57)
that will take you to the same place (40:55 - 41:01)
this email here is from Joseph hey spj (40:57 - 41:03)
Travis will and the B team the week of (41:01 - 41:05)
thanksgiving i moved from South Carolina (41:03 - 41:08)
to Boston as a homeschooler making (41:05 - 41:10)
friend making friends is a bit harder (41:08 - 41:14)
when I went to the library yes this (41:10 - 41:17)
still exists yes well I'm all right when (41:14 - 41:19)
I went to the library I use my knowledge (41:17 - 41:21)
of video games to make some friends and (41:19 - 41:22)
now we meet up almost every day to play (41:21 - 41:24)
together so here's my question do you (41:22 - 41:26)
guys ever use video games to help you (41:24 - 41:28)
out in hard times to make friends Joseph (41:26 - 41:31)
from Boston Massachusetts yeah there's (41:28 - 41:33)
this program called it's super effective (41:31 - 41:36)
and most of the people i would call my (41:33 - 41:38)
friends i've probably met through this (41:36 - 41:40)
program does that qualify that's a (41:38 - 41:47)
biggie haha yeah totally um I think the (41:40 - 41:49)
one of the most difficult things and (41:47 - 41:53)
making friends I mean like I think both (41:49 - 41:57)
individuals in meetup of strangers can (41:53 - 42:00)
can both want in both see another person (41:57 - 42:02)
and think oh that person seems cool I (42:00 - 42:04)
bet we would be friends and even though (42:02 - 42:07)
both people have that desire (42:04 - 42:09)
that's not always all you need a lot of (42:07 - 42:11)
the time you need some sort of common (42:09 - 42:13)
ground upon which to start a (42:11 - 42:16)
conversation and video games movie and (42:13 - 42:18)
you any media is right for that and (42:16 - 42:20)
video games especially for the reasons (42:18 - 42:23)
you said because certain video games (42:20 - 42:26)
Pokemon included are profoundly social (42:23 - 42:29)
so they encourage that type of (42:26 - 42:33)
interaction so yeah and and I have gone (42:29 - 42:36)
to the DC Public Library with the they (42:33 - 42:38)
have a weekly Pokemon League and made (42:36 - 42:40)
friends with people there so it's kind (42:38 - 42:42)
of the same thing as being in Boston in (42:40 - 42:44)
doing that probably most of my really (42:42 - 42:48)
good friends I either met via work or (42:44 - 42:52)
like employment jobs that that kind of (42:48 - 42:55)
stuff or because of the actual podcast (42:52 - 42:58)
itself totally a doable means I know (42:55 - 43:00)
Joseph was on the younger side and so (42:58 - 43:03)
once you get more into like a full-time (43:00 - 43:05)
job and stuff like that i think that's (43:03 - 43:08)
another great way to get friends because (43:05 - 43:09)
you're you're stuck with those people (43:08 - 43:11)
for 40 hours a week so hopefully you can (43:09 - 43:14)
find one or two of them that you that (43:11 - 43:17)
you enjoy their company so it was this (43:14 - 43:21)
youngster joseph youngster joey ok yeah (43:17 - 43:23)
yeah yeah finally writing in after all (43:21 - 43:25)
these years we only get the the finest (43:23 - 43:27)
celebrities that right into us robert (43:25 - 43:30)
rights in from Seattle Washington hello (43:27 - 43:32)
spj will Travis and possibly be teen and (43:30 - 43:35)
associated dirty dogs have a quick (43:32 - 43:38)
question for you your D&D campaign was (43:35 - 43:41)
really enjoyable to listen to and it got (43:38 - 43:43)
me really it got me extremely inspired (43:41 - 43:45)
to create my own fantasy content I have (43:43 - 43:47)
gone through and drawn all the (43:45 - 43:49)
characters from D&D and then it hit me (43:47 - 43:51)
could I use the characters spj stance (43:49 - 43:54)
demotius Wendy meepo Winnipeg tali @d (43:51 - 43:57)
pepper and the rest of the them in a (43:54 - 44:00)
comic rendition of my personal take on (43:57 - 44:03)
the story thus far I already emailed (44:00 - 44:05)
Robert and improve that I thought it (44:03 - 44:06)
would be a good idea to ask permission (44:05 - 44:08)
first considering how careful people are (44:06 - 44:11)
with stuff like this these days anyways (44:08 - 44:12)
keep up the good work over at the (44:11 - 44:15)
podcast and I hope you read this on an (44:12 - 44:18)
episode I want to hear Steve say Trick (44:15 - 44:21)
Scott phobia (44:18 - 44:22)
there you go i said whatever that is (44:21 - 44:25)
thanks Robert it's the fear of the (44:22 - 44:28)
number 13 tricks good dekha phobia yeah (44:25 - 44:30)
that's the word PS tell will that he is (44:28 - 44:33)
right about red vines of twizzlers PPS (44:30 - 44:36)
steve is my favorite no thanks uh yeah (44:33 - 44:38)
so I no real question here well I guess (44:36 - 44:39)
the question is can I use those (44:38 - 44:43)
characters to do art / make comic of the (44:39 - 44:47)
answer is yes absolutely I it's like if (44:43 - 44:49)
somebody was to use the it's super (44:47 - 44:51)
effective logo or like the it's super (44:49 - 44:54)
effective theme song or outro I would be (44:51 - 44:57)
very protective of that stuff and (44:54 - 45:00)
rightfully so there's been plenty of (44:57 - 45:02)
apps that tried to use my old logo but (45:00 - 45:06)
for something like like the D&D campaign (45:02 - 45:09)
we did I think it's it's heartwarming to (45:06 - 45:11)
see people like illustrate those (45:09 - 45:13)
characters in their own rendition or (45:11 - 45:14)
what they what they think those (45:13 - 45:17)
characters look like in their mind yes I (45:14 - 45:19)
have no problem with that I think that's (45:17 - 45:22)
really cool and see to see and I like if (45:19 - 45:24)
that campaign meant something to you (45:22 - 45:26)
when you wanted to you know use those (45:24 - 45:29)
characters and draw them or make a comic (45:26 - 45:33)
of those like yeah go for it I I think (45:29 - 45:34)
that's great I don't know if travis has (45:33 - 45:37)
any input on that only that I I totally (45:34 - 45:42)
agree I whether it's that Wendy or (45:37 - 45:46)
Baruch are relatable to you or you just (45:42 - 45:48)
find them to be interesting funny (45:46 - 45:51)
characters I am flattered at any time (45:48 - 45:55)
anyone does anything with those those (45:51 - 45:56)
characters i think it's i think it's (45:55 - 45:58)
really awesome so go for it Daniel (45:56 - 46:03)
writes in from 29 palms California which (45:58 - 46:05)
i guess is 45 minutes away from Palm (46:03 - 46:08)
Springs I didn't even see the original (46:05 - 46:10)
28 palms I'm Way behind on the franchise (46:08 - 46:13)
oh it's actually a palms countdown (46:10 - 46:15)
between like palm strings little palm (46:13 - 46:19)
strings that would be gross Palm Springs (46:15 - 46:21)
all and string theory where it's like it (46:19 - 46:23)
starts like Palm Springs is technically (46:21 - 46:25)
like 50 palms and then they just (46:23 - 46:27)
countdown as you head towards Los (46:25 - 46:30)
Angeles wait so are you saying there's a (46:27 - 46:34)
28 palms California 49 palms 48 palm (46:30 - 46:38)
47 not only the ex palms I believe I (46:34 - 46:39)
mean believe what you want to believe (46:38 - 46:47)
Ripley but you know who's got knowledge (46:39 - 46:49)
of geography okay come on name all of (46:47 - 46:51)
the countries that came from Yugoslavia (46:49 - 46:53)
let's go you've had a year to study up (46:51 - 46:56)
and that I believe you avoid the (46:53 - 47:02)
question the question was what defines a (46:56 - 47:04)
sandwich we need to talk about this (47:02 - 47:08)
because yishun hey I'm just I'm just I'm (47:04 - 47:10)
reading that I'm reading the questions (47:08 - 47:13)
that's all I'm doing here we need to (47:10 - 47:15)
talk about this because I don't know if (47:13 - 47:16)
you knew what you were doing when you (47:15 - 47:18)
were posting fake news on your Twitter (47:16 - 47:21)
account what you posted this falsified (47:18 - 47:24)
screenshot that said the FDA classified (47:21 - 47:28)
hot dogs as a sandwich I saw the YouTube (47:24 - 47:30)
video we're in YouTube personality (47:28 - 47:33)
jacksFilms encouraged all of his viewers (47:30 - 47:36)
to make fake news articles one of which (47:33 - 47:39)
is that the FDA approves hot dog as a (47:36 - 47:42)
sandwich and I have a question for you (47:39 - 47:45)
Steve are you either one a completely (47:42 - 47:47)
uncritical consumer of the news that you (47:45 - 47:49)
see that you just see a thing with a (47:47 - 47:52)
headline and assume that it is true at (47:49 - 47:55)
which point I you you really need to (47:52 - 47:58)
become a more informed consumer of news (47:55 - 48:01)
or two did you know that this was fakin (47:58 - 48:02)
intentionally tried to mislead her (48:01 - 48:04)
audience which i think is enough his (48:02 - 48:08)
words frankly well said well saying so I (48:04 - 48:11)
when it was when it went let's back up a (48:08 - 48:14)
second so the the screenshot of CNN and (48:11 - 48:17)
it said the FDA declares a hot dog is a (48:14 - 48:20)
sandwich I laughed really hard at as as (48:17 - 48:22)
anyone would in that situation because (48:20 - 48:25)
it's an extremely funny headline (48:22 - 48:27)
regardless of context right so the first (48:25 - 48:29)
thing I did is I went to see an end and (48:27 - 48:32)
I searched for it and wasn't there and (48:29 - 48:34)
then i used google news because i (48:32 - 48:37)
figured CNN search engine like any (48:34 - 48:39)
website search engine was not as good as (48:37 - 48:42)
just typing in CNN then the headline (48:39 - 48:44)
into google and then testing to see if (48:42 - 48:46)
google could find the article and it (48:44 - 48:47)
couldn't (48:46 - 48:50)
that time I determined oh this is (48:47 - 48:53)
clearly fake but it was still relevant (48:50 - 48:56)
to the show right because we've had this (48:53 - 48:58)
conversation so often that I tweeted it (48:56 - 49:01)
with the with me like impression of like (48:58 - 49:05)
this is relevant to our listeners and (49:01 - 49:07)
then I got rid of it because I I then (49:05 - 49:09)
thought oh what if people don't know (49:07 - 49:12)
that I'm sure like this is a joke like I (49:09 - 49:14)
know it's a joke because I did the (49:12 - 49:16)
research and like I still think the (49:14 - 49:18)
screenshot is funny I deleted it because (49:16 - 49:21)
I didn't want anyone to think oh this is (49:18 - 49:24)
real because like in my mind it well (49:21 - 49:26)
it's clearly not real I I didn't know (49:24 - 49:28)
that you deleted the tweet afterward (49:26 - 49:31)
that was a very thoughtful move but I (49:28 - 49:33)
did think it was funny and and and for (49:31 - 49:37)
us debating about big sandwiches it way (49:33 - 49:39)
was relevant to our show right I always (49:37 - 49:42)
encourage our listeners to especially I (49:39 - 49:43)
like the subreddit like if something is (49:42 - 49:45)
relevant that we talked about in the (49:43 - 49:46)
podcast like boat race was a big thing (49:45 - 49:48)
for a while share that with us because (49:46 - 49:50)
that's that's great that's like super (49:48 - 49:51)
funny and so some when somebody was like (49:50 - 49:54)
ah like look at this FDA declares a bug (49:51 - 49:56)
by the way it is true that the state of (49:54 - 49:58)
New York does declare a hot dog is a (49:56 - 50:00)
sandwich to go back I did delete it just (49:58 - 50:02)
because I didn't want to mislead anyone (50:00 - 50:03)
I just thought it was funny because it (50:02 - 50:06)
was relevant to our podcast glad we have (50:03 - 50:08)
that settled well I've got news for you (50:06 - 50:11)
Charles Foster Kane well that's really (50:08 - 50:12)
weird was that watching that movie today (50:11 - 50:14)
I mean not that not that is the first (50:12 - 50:16)
time I saw Citizen Kane but I was (50:14 - 50:18)
literally watching Citizen Kane again (50:16 - 50:21)
today now I've got some news for both of (50:18 - 50:23)
you I have moved to a point in my life (50:21 - 50:26)
where I only find it's important to put (50:23 - 50:29)
definitions around actual things that (50:26 - 50:31)
matter and things that don't matter i (50:29 - 50:33)
will leave free to people's imagination (50:31 - 50:35)
and they can have it any way they wish (50:33 - 50:36)
as long as it doesn't have a negative (50:35 - 50:38)
impact on my life and i will remain in (50:36 - 50:43)
peace in Xanadu a sandwich has to have (50:38 - 50:45)
bread (50:43 - 50:48)
about Citizen Kane now now that movies (50:45 - 50:53)
no good whoa or factory Oh snoozer Ino (50:48 - 50:57)
assume if you want to be two dogs and a (50:53 - 51:00)
cat in the middle or if you want a (50:57 - 51:02)
sandwich to be the third planet that (51:00 - 51:04)
NASA recently discovered that can (51:02 - 51:07)
possibly support human life you go right (51:04 - 51:10)
ahead that's a sandwich enjoy it the hot (51:07 - 51:12)
dog is meat surrounded by bread so (51:10 - 51:15)
therefore I think it's a sandwich you're (51:12 - 51:17)
not dragging me back into this arena if (51:15 - 51:21)
you were to put like cheese and mayo (51:17 - 51:25)
between a softshell taco shell that's (51:21 - 51:27)
not a sandwich because of there's no (51:25 - 51:29)
bread in that situation you mean a (51:27 - 51:33)
tortilla yeah I'm sorry I socius and (51:29 - 51:35)
Kane was bad can we talk about some (51:33 - 51:37)
citizen Kane's not never seen it i've (51:35 - 51:38)
never seen it it's just not that (51:37 - 51:40)
exciting it's like there's no explosions (51:38 - 51:44)
oh there's no explosions anytime Citizen (51:40 - 51:46)
Kane is brought up I think of the (51:44 - 51:48)
Simpsons episode where they're walking (51:46 - 51:52)
through the movie Museum and there's (51:48 - 51:55)
like a cane in some glass and it says (51:52 - 51:58)
kid says Citizen Kane above it and Lisa (51:55 - 52:02)
goes hey there's no Kane in Citizen Kane (51:58 - 52:06)
no no it's so funny to me what else do (52:02 - 52:10)
we got here this one is from Scott from (52:06 - 52:13)
Brooklyn New York wheres and we're hot (52:10 - 52:15)
dogs are considered sandwiches what do (52:13 - 52:17)
you all possibly think of the pokemon (52:15 - 52:19)
company adding the ability to transfer (52:17 - 52:22)
Pokemon from Pokemon go to Pokemon bank (52:19 - 52:24)
as some data minds have indicated (52:22 - 52:27)
building on your conversation in episode (52:24 - 52:29)
252 it could potentially be another (52:27 - 52:31)
shortcut of getting competition ready (52:29 - 52:34)
Pokemon imagine a higher CP pokemon in (52:31 - 52:36)
pokemon go would likely have higher IVs (52:34 - 52:38)
in sun and moon while also giving rope (52:36 - 52:41)
folks a reason to go back to Pokemon go (52:38 - 52:43)
thanks I love all the hosts equally (52:41 - 52:46)
Scott how are the the Pokemon did we (52:43 - 52:48)
ever get a final on how the pokemon that (52:46 - 52:50)
you move up from the virtual console (52:48 - 52:52)
games how they're Ivy's and everything (52:50 - 52:55)
are determined is it a role at a dice or (52:52 - 52:57)
that's guaranteed three perfect ivs (52:55 - 52:58)
everything (52:57 - 53:00)
ulcers random all right so it's probably (52:58 - 53:03)
going to be the same and pretty perfect (53:00 - 53:05)
ivs is not enough to get you competitive (53:03 - 53:09)
buddy that's halfway there there's some (53:05 - 53:10)
pokemon are you you're still gonna have (53:09 - 53:12)
to breed there's some pokemon where if (53:10 - 53:15)
it's like a really hits like a glass (53:12 - 53:18)
cannon type of thing like you're having (53:15 - 53:22)
a 31 IV and defense on you're like a (53:18 - 53:25)
shell gore isn't really going to make it (53:22 - 53:27)
live any hits it wouldn't otherwise so (53:25 - 53:31)
if it likes it really fast Braille (53:27 - 53:33)
Pokemon you could theoretically get away (53:31 - 53:36)
with just HP the offensive stat and (53:33 - 53:39)
speed why don't you just call that (53:36 - 53:43)
Pokemon a choke or Excel gore I think it (53:39 - 53:46)
is so yeah I mean I mean I'm thinking of (53:43 - 53:50)
like it's because of like I mean I thank (53:46 - 53:52)
you from Steve I expected it from you (53:50 - 53:56)
look I get it I get it from playing from (53:52 - 53:57)
playing music in high school and like a (53:56 - 54:01)
cello Rondo and stuff like fee were like (53:57 - 54:04)
Italian it's not in a bland bug it's an (54:01 - 54:06)
American bug from you Nova named Excel (54:04 - 54:09)
Gore what cool I mean it I would I would (54:06 - 54:13)
I would argue that it doesn't matter (54:09 - 54:18)
what did I just Rob ja Rule a sandwich I (54:13 - 54:19)
think it's a Slugger because i think the (54:18 - 54:21)
anime definitely says that but i guess (54:19 - 54:23)
the question is would you want to see (54:21 - 54:27)
pokemon go Pokemon get transferred to (54:23 - 54:30)
seven moon no I think that does that (54:27 - 54:32)
negatively impact either game in any way (54:30 - 54:35)
I think it'd be cool now i think that (54:32 - 54:38)
there's there's enough value and I mean (54:35 - 54:40)
especially if they do it the same way as (54:38 - 54:42)
they do the Virtual Console pokemon that (54:40 - 54:43)
I mean you're still going to have to (54:42 - 54:45)
work to get the really competitive ones (54:43 - 54:48)
you know I I don't think a higher CP (54:45 - 54:50)
well let's ignore the competitive aspect (54:48 - 54:53)
because frankly like that's that's not a (54:50 - 54:56)
big part of pokemon like like yes there (54:53 - 54:58)
are people who love to competitively (54:56 - 55:00)
battle pokemon but as we've seen from (54:58 - 55:02)
tournaments and the amount of people who (55:00 - 55:04)
buy the game there are definitely people (55:02 - 55:06)
who just like to collect and play (55:04 - 55:08)
pokemon well sure so it's going to help (55:06 - 55:11)
you complete B's or IVs or what gets (55:08 - 55:12)
transferred is (55:11 - 55:14)
the fact of how do you feel if the (55:12 - 55:17)
Caterpie you cotton Pokemon go can get (55:14 - 55:21)
moved to Pokemon Sun and Moon I mean I (55:17 - 55:23)
guess I think it's cool yeah there's (55:21 - 55:24)
people who are forming relationships (55:23 - 55:27)
with their Pokemon go Pokemon the same (55:24 - 55:28)
way that we form relationships with our (55:27 - 55:32)
regular pokemon pokemon but what if what (55:28 - 55:35)
if it was a rare pokemon like Dragon (55:32 - 55:37)
Knight do you think that D values I'm (55:35 - 55:40)
making sure the more the merrier it (55:37 - 55:43)
doesn't matter oakham on that are like (55:40 - 55:47)
rare commodities our event only pokemon (55:43 - 55:51)
really and you're not getting those in (55:47 - 55:54)
Pokemon go like dragonite might be hard (55:51 - 55:56)
to achieve within sun and moon because (55:54 - 55:59)
you have to do is dragonair one of the (55:56 - 56:02)
book or dragon yet blessings boom boy (55:59 - 56:04)
because goomy's now i'm sure and go but (56:02 - 56:05)
let's just pretend because goot like you (56:04 - 56:08)
said earlier goomy is a little harder to (56:05 - 56:12)
get in in sun and moon sure but like (56:08 - 56:15)
once you get it once you can breed as (56:12 - 56:19)
many as you want whereas arguably it's (56:15 - 56:21)
harder to get a dragonite in Pokemon go (56:19 - 56:24)
than it sorry a theoretical goodra and (56:21 - 56:27)
Pokemon go than it is to get a goodra in (56:24 - 56:29)
book on sun and moon because he takes a (56:27 - 56:31)
while to get your first goomy sure but (56:29 - 56:33)
then you just evolve it by leveling it (56:31 - 56:36)
up manages a long time to get enough (56:33 - 56:37)
candy is to hold on oh come on go I (56:36 - 56:40)
would yeah that's a that's a feat that's (56:37 - 56:42)
very difficult only a Duvall you said at (56:40 - 56:44)
all i think the more the merrier even (56:42 - 56:46)
worse than that you guys won't even go (56:44 - 56:48)
out to catch ice pokemon when it's (56:46 - 56:49)
snowing out who's gonna go out to try to (56:48 - 56:54)
catch a goodra in the rain haha i hear (56:49 - 56:57)
ya yeah I mean I'm not sayin I'm against (56:54 - 57:00)
it I just was forming a conversation I (56:57 - 57:02)
think I think you guys are right that (57:00 - 57:05)
Pokemon go might be a little bit harder (57:02 - 57:09)
to get said Pokemon I mean obviously you (57:05 - 57:10)
open a Pokemon go and you see nothing (57:09 - 57:14)
but who hoots and and write it as and (57:10 - 57:16)
piggies but those are pokemon that you (57:14 - 57:18)
encounter within the first five minutes (57:16 - 57:21)
of the actual game so i can't imagine (57:18 - 57:24)
that d values or takes away from from (57:21 - 57:25)
the actual (57:24 - 57:29)
in moon or vice versa Pokemon go next (57:25 - 57:33)
question here is from gwark gark from (57:29 - 57:37)
how it's spelled ga ARR UK Garrick (57:33 - 57:40)
Garrick that's a lot so I'm gonna go all (57:37 - 57:43)
right Cincinnati Ohio writes in I'm (57:40 - 57:45)
curious when the next season of your (57:43 - 57:47)
Pokemon dungeons and dragon podcast will (57:45 - 57:50)
come out and I couldn't find any info (57:47 - 57:53)
about it when I attempted to look it up (57:50 - 57:56)
keep up the good work Derek I really (57:53 - 57:57)
have nothing to say on this on this (57:56 - 58:00)
topic I pulled this question too I guess (57:57 - 58:02)
say that because there hasn't been any (58:00 - 58:07)
information of season three mythical out (58:02 - 58:10)
there we talked about this off air last (58:07 - 58:12)
week because you know it is something (58:10 - 58:14)
that that conversations have revolved (58:12 - 58:16)
around and obviously when we finished (58:14 - 58:19)
season two we just didn't it's we've (58:16 - 58:20)
definitely been talking about it and (58:19 - 58:23)
doing stuff with it and what we talked (58:20 - 58:26)
about off air was the whole mindset of I (58:23 - 58:29)
have I have multiple projects in the (58:26 - 58:32)
works and I don't like announcing those (58:29 - 58:35)
projects in case something falls through (58:32 - 58:38)
allen from tuesday night podcast one of (58:35 - 58:40)
the people I coast my board game podcast (58:38 - 58:43)
with said something that you would think (58:40 - 58:45)
that when when you tell somebody you're (58:43 - 58:47)
going to do something that you are more (58:45 - 58:50)
likely to actually do it but in reality (58:47 - 58:51)
when you tell somebody you're going to (58:50 - 58:53)
do something you're actually less likely (58:51 - 58:56)
to do it because you've already gotten (58:53 - 58:58)
the reward of telling that person so if (58:56 - 59:02)
I tell well hey i am going to do an art (58:58 - 59:05)
show in 2018 and we'll goes oh that's (59:02 - 59:07)
really cool awesome like I can't wait (59:05 - 59:09)
I've already gotten the reward I've (59:07 - 59:11)
already gotten the the feedback of like (59:09 - 59:13)
that's awesome that's great congrats (59:11 - 59:17)
whereas now I don't feel like I really (59:13 - 59:19)
need to do it because I would have got (59:17 - 59:22)
that congrats or a good job or awesome I (59:19 - 59:25)
got that now instead of getting it in (59:22 - 59:28)
you know 2018 when the quote-unquote (59:25 - 59:29)
example I would have used does that make (59:28 - 59:31)
sense as I explained that right Travis (59:29 - 59:33)
you're the near the smart person here (59:31 - 59:35)
gee I wouldn't go that far but just long (59:33 - 59:39)
story short visualization is often cited (59:35 - 59:39)
as (59:39 - 59:42)
a tool to help you achieve your goals (59:39 - 59:45)
but in terms of long-term goals actually (59:42 - 59:49)
most of the literature can agrees that (59:45 - 59:54)
visualization makes you less likely to (59:49 - 59:55)
achieve those long-term goals because (59:54 - 59:57)
the act of imagining yourself achieving (59:55 - 60:00)
them gives you a reward and you're it (59:57 - 60:03)
triggers the same reward responses in (60:00 - 60:05)
your brain so you're less likely to (60:03 - 60:07)
actually try to achieve that goal (60:05 - 60:09)
because to some extent you have already (60:07 - 60:11)
partially has received the award for (60:09 - 60:14)
doing so just by imagining it there's a (60:11 - 60:15)
lot that would have to go into a season (60:14 - 60:18)
three there the recording has to be done (60:15 - 60:19)
there would have to be all new music (60:18 - 60:22)
which nick has done fantastic music for (60:19 - 60:24)
the show he's he's the one that's been (60:22 - 60:27)
doing the new break music so there would (60:24 - 60:28)
have to be music there would have to be (60:27 - 60:31)
editing there there that's all on me of (60:28 - 60:34)
like also making a new logo and and (60:31 - 60:36)
getting that taken care of because we're (60:34 - 60:39)
no longer using the old pokeball logo (60:36 - 60:42)
that mythical was originally based off (60:39 - 60:43)
them so there's a lot of work that needs (60:42 - 60:45)
to be done I do want just to let (60:43 - 60:47)
everyone know that that is a constant (60:45 - 60:49)
conversation we're having off air and (60:47 - 60:52)
just you know keep looking forward to it (60:49 - 60:55)
once anything gets announced you're (60:52 - 60:56)
going to hear it on the show first if (60:55 - 61:00)
not via a patreon message or an email or (60:56 - 61:02)
Twitter or Facebook so or all of the (61:00 - 61:04)
above are all of the above so like it is (61:02 - 61:06)
something that that I do get a lot of (61:04 - 61:08)
feedback on of asking where it is I just (61:06 - 61:10)
want to put that out there that you know (61:08 - 61:12)
it is a constant conversation that we (61:10 - 61:16)
are having Boulder snap hi spj listening (61:12 - 61:17)
last week's show I heard you were (61:16 - 61:19)
selling wat zip shirts while that (61:17 - 61:21)
particular item does not interest me I (61:19 - 61:23)
wanted to ask if you were considering (61:21 - 61:25)
much related to mythical I know my (61:23 - 61:27)
secret crush Logan has done a lot of (61:25 - 61:28)
renderings of characters and scenes from (61:27 - 61:30)
the show and I know that was something I (61:28 - 61:32)
would buy in that manner also you are (61:30 - 61:35)
great but will is my favorite travis has (61:32 - 61:36)
his Pokemon of the weak spot which is (61:35 - 61:39)
excellent but I have you thought of (61:36 - 61:41)
getting willed to do also a small spot (61:39 - 61:43)
maybe a TCG card of the week or (61:41 - 61:44)
something to compare with Travis's (61:43 - 61:47)
segment just an idea because I would (61:44 - 61:49)
like to hear more of will thanks and (61:47 - 61:51)
have fun in my hometown of Boston at PAX (61:49 - 61:53)
Boulder snap you (61:51 - 61:55)
no I have an entire podcast called dr (61:53 - 61:56)
check that you listen to every week (61:55 - 61:59)
where it's pretty much me and Cole and (61:56 - 62:02)
Jack just talking about cards they're (61:59 - 62:04)
just unfortunately not pokemon cards (62:02 - 62:07)
yeah uh yeah I've definitely thought (62:04 - 62:09)
about giving will his own segment (62:07 - 62:12)
especially since that since I feel like (62:09 - 62:15)
Pokemon of the week has gotten more let (62:12 - 62:18)
me use a Travis heavy let me let me see (62:15 - 62:21)
buzzwords it's gotten very streamlined (62:18 - 62:25)
uh i think it's it's shorter but more (62:21 - 62:28)
concise I think what Travis did with (62:25 - 62:30)
that and that was really kind of on the (62:28 - 62:32)
fly of like hey Travis I want you to (62:30 - 62:34)
talk more and you know be more prepared (62:32 - 62:37)
and just kind of give off a move set (62:34 - 62:39)
because again i know a lot of our (62:37 - 62:41)
listeners aren't competitive but i do (62:39 - 62:43)
know that some are and so that that (62:41 - 62:45)
segment is is valuable to them and i (62:43 - 62:47)
don't want to get rid of that and so (62:45 - 62:49)
like Travis going through that and (62:47 - 62:51)
pulling move sets from slack and (62:49 - 62:54)
explaining how that Pokemon works and (62:51 - 62:55)
getting that done and like what would (62:54 - 62:58)
you say Travis four or five minutes yeah (62:55 - 63:00)
and and doing that and then be following (62:58 - 63:02)
up with your standard poke my facts I (63:00 - 63:04)
think that works really well and I would (63:02 - 63:07)
love for will dead do something like (63:04 - 63:09)
that but I don't know what that would be (63:07 - 63:12)
especially because what was actually old (63:09 - 63:14)
school will written articles on the (63:12 - 63:17)
website the Pokemon of the week articles (63:14 - 63:22)
that were yeah um I wouldn't say veered (63:17 - 63:24)
because that implies it was unintended (63:22 - 63:29)
but often took interesting strange turns (63:24 - 63:31)
personal personal turns or like (63:29 - 63:34)
interpersonal turns that were very (63:31 - 63:36)
touching i thought i'm a big fan of (63:34 - 63:38)
those so to say that pokemon of the week (63:36 - 63:41)
is my segment fails to acknowledge that (63:38 - 63:45)
a much more emotionally mature version (63:41 - 63:47)
of pokemon of the week was headed by (63:45 - 63:50)
none other than will anderson and and (63:47 - 63:52)
you know there has been a brotherhood of (63:50 - 63:54)
pokemon of the week writers for the (63:52 - 63:56)
website so you can't leave out david (63:54 - 63:58)
thomas who started the whole franchise (63:56 - 64:01)
that's correct you yeah welcome Thomas (63:58 - 64:04)
from wendys no net well maybe we don't (64:01 - 64:06)
know we don't have enough information I (64:04 - 64:10)
well isn't dish I thought well actually (64:06 - 64:14)
we kind of do well doesn't play the the (64:10 - 64:16)
the pokemon TCG so I don't know if a (64:14 - 64:20)
card of a week would be great cuz Yuri I (64:16 - 64:21)
mean I could make stuff up but it's (64:20 - 64:23)
probably just gonna be shaming e x every (64:21 - 64:25)
week until I hear some other card people (64:23 - 64:29)
complain I don't want to fall down any (64:25 - 64:33)
any wells of I don't know where I'm (64:29 - 64:36)
going with this tippy-toe fall down the (64:33 - 64:40)
well I think that it's super effective (64:36 - 64:44)
really relates to a time and place in (64:40 - 64:46)
all of our lives and I say that because (64:44 - 64:50)
when we started off the show we ran down (64:46 - 64:52)
six different pokemon in teams and how (64:50 - 64:56)
that works and that was me with very (64:52 - 64:58)
little knowledge why I thought at the (64:56 - 65:00)
time that I have not a lot of knowledge (64:58 - 65:03)
about the video game and I proved that I (65:00 - 65:05)
didn't but people for some reason like (65:03 - 65:07)
that segment and continued listening to (65:05 - 65:09)
it and people always right in has to (65:07 - 65:11)
bring back feature team so maybe I did (65:09 - 65:13)
something right when that segment was (65:11 - 65:16)
introduced and when I was playing the (65:13 - 65:18)
card game very competitively that there (65:16 - 65:21)
was the the show itself was much more (65:18 - 65:24)
TCG focused and that gave Travis at (65:21 - 65:28)
least a good 20 minutes to zone out and (65:24 - 65:31)
then you know when will and I were (65:28 - 65:32)
playing shuffle a lot we would cover a (65:31 - 65:35)
lot of different shuffle news at the (65:32 - 65:37)
beginning of the show when Pokemon go (65:35 - 65:39)
came out you know most of those episodes (65:37 - 65:44)
were very pokemon go focus so if one of (65:39 - 65:46)
us were playing the TCG we would (65:44 - 65:49)
probably definitely have more TCG stuff (65:46 - 65:51)
to talk about ah but I don't want to (65:49 - 65:54)
force that on anyone of like well will (65:51 - 65:56)
you supply the TCG so do a TG TCG (65:54 - 65:58)
segment just because we have to like we (65:56 - 66:00)
don't do anything on the show because we (65:58 - 66:02)
have to we we just do it because that's (66:00 - 66:05)
what's organically happening in our (66:02 - 66:08)
lives at the time and I think that may I (66:05 - 66:09)
don't know I assume that's why people (66:08 - 66:13)
like the show yeah I mean that's part of (66:09 - 66:15)
it and and you know yes I enjoy playing (66:13 - 66:18)
the TCG but there were reasons why I (66:15 - 66:20)
stopped playing the TC (66:18 - 66:23)
and those reasons haven't changed at (66:20 - 66:26)
this point I mean maybe they will change (66:23 - 66:28)
but at this point they haven't so I (66:26 - 66:32)
think there are more theoretical (66:28 - 66:37)
we'll segments than just TCG of the week (66:32 - 66:39)
I think I think some thinking out of the (66:37 - 66:41)
box i mean if you just wanted to talk (66:39 - 66:42)
about new trading card games everything (66:41 - 66:47)
i guess a guy i'd be proud i gotta hear (66:42 - 66:49)
about all of them yeah we could we we (66:47 - 66:51)
can brainstorm brain storm something but (66:49 - 66:53)
no i do agree that that I feel like (66:51 - 66:55)
we'll should have a dedicated you know (66:53 - 66:56)
four to five minutes like Lake Travis (66:55 - 66:59)
does not more not any more than that (66:56 - 67:01)
because I I have to hear myself talk the (66:59 - 67:04)
most so clearly we can't take away time (67:01 - 67:07)
from that that was a joke by the way to (67:04 - 67:09)
the beginning question the zip (67:07 - 67:10)
shirts by the time you hear that they'll (67:09 - 67:13)
probably be closed for pre-order we ran (67:10 - 67:16)
those for two weeks as mythical related (67:13 - 67:20)
merch I don't have anything in mind that (67:16 - 67:21)
show doesn't do as well as it's super (67:20 - 67:25)
fective so audience why's it might be (67:21 - 67:27)
you know we might might move a couple (67:25 - 67:30)
but I don't know a lot what I will say (67:27 - 67:33)
is that I do plan on doing a Kickstarter (67:30 - 67:36)
soon and that's there's a lot of reasons (67:33 - 67:38)
for that but I think really the main (67:36 - 67:42)
reason is for merch yeah and I say that (67:38 - 67:45)
because with the patreon like those like (67:42 - 67:47)
all our patreon backers are fantastic (67:45 - 67:48)
and I appreciate every single one of (67:47 - 67:50)
them even if they gave like a doll or a (67:48 - 67:53)
month or you know two dollars and 22 (67:50 - 67:54)
cents which I think somebody actually (67:53 - 67:57)
gives like that's all fantastic and that (67:54 - 67:59)
reward is getting into slack and there (67:57 - 68:02)
are other rewards to that but there are (67:59 - 68:04)
noting that there are no physical (68:02 - 68:06)
rewards and every now and then I like to (68:04 - 68:08)
do a short run which like the zip (68:06 - 68:10)
shirt is one of those but I don't I (68:08 - 68:11)
don't do a lot of short runs because (68:10 - 68:14)
there's just so many shirts out there in (68:11 - 68:16)
the world and there are a lot of cool (68:14 - 68:18)
ones and there are a lot of though there (68:16 - 68:19)
are just a lot of cool ones that exist (68:18 - 68:22)
for periods of time and you know they (68:19 - 68:23)
might be forgettable but there's always (68:22 - 68:25)
like I could sign it on the internet (68:23 - 68:27)
every single day and find a cool shirt (68:25 - 68:29)
that I would be willing to buy but also (68:27 - 68:31)
at the same time I have way too many (68:29 - 68:32)
shirts in my closet so it's just (68:31 - 68:34)
something I don't do and I feel like a (68:32 - 68:36)
lot of people fall fall under that like (68:34 - 68:39)
shirts are just everyone has too many of (68:36 - 68:41)
them and there are already too many (68:39 - 68:45)
great designs out there but as for the (68:41 - 68:47)
reason doing a Kickstarter is yeah (68:45 - 68:49)
that'll give us a couple more bucks to (68:47 - 68:50)
upgrade equipment or two (68:49 - 68:53)
to you know use that money to do other (68:50 - 68:57)
stuff for conventions or shows or or (68:53 - 68:59)
whatever we decide to put that money (68:57 - 69:04)
towards but it gives the it lets us do (68:59 - 69:07)
merchandise in a way of like okay you (69:04 - 69:11)
know exactly 50 people why I want this (69:07 - 69:13)
kind of shirt I go back to shirts but (69:11 - 69:16)
let's just say a shirt cool we know (69:13 - 69:18)
exactly 50 people want that shirt we (69:16 - 69:20)
know exactly what size they want because (69:18 - 69:23)
of Kickstarter and we gave them a time (69:20 - 69:24)
frame of two months so we can get those (69:23 - 69:27)
shirts made and shipped off but more so (69:24 - 69:30)
that we that with the case starter that (69:27 - 69:32)
I plan on doing this spring I have Nick (69:30 - 69:35)
making custom music for it so there'll (69:32 - 69:36)
be a little digital soundtrack that you (69:35 - 69:39)
can get of Pokemon music that isn't (69:36 - 69:41)
actually pokemon music but that is (69:39 - 69:44)
inspired by Pokemon music so that's (69:41 - 69:45)
really cool that's something we can (69:44 - 69:48)
offer I have my co who is an extremely (69:45 - 69:50)
talented artist doing some great (69:48 - 69:52)
portraits that I'll be able to canvas (69:50 - 69:55)
print and if you don't know what canvas (69:52 - 69:58)
print is it's it's like a stretch piece (69:55 - 70:00)
of cloth with the image printed already (69:58 - 70:02)
framed and ready to go so really it's (70:00 - 70:04)
like one nail in your wall and you can (70:02 - 70:07)
hang it and also that'll be in poster (70:04 - 70:09)
form which is you know frame it yourself (70:07 - 70:11)
getting a poster too but canvas print (70:09 - 70:13)
that's my way to go i love canvas prints (70:11 - 70:15)
so you i have micah doing some stuff i (70:13 - 70:18)
have nick doing some stuff i'll be doing (70:15 - 70:19)
some stuff so that the really the (70:18 - 70:21)
kickstarter is here's a bunch of pokemon (70:19 - 70:24)
podcast merch you can get physical (70:21 - 70:26)
things whether that's buttons stickers (70:24 - 70:29)
artwork music and you can help support (70:26 - 70:32)
the show and mostly that money will be (70:29 - 70:35)
going to making that product shipping (70:32 - 70:37)
that product and getting it into your (70:35 - 70:39)
like getting it into your hands so it's (70:37 - 70:42)
not like all that but like I think (70:39 - 70:43)
that's the confusing thing of (70:42 - 70:45)
Kickstarter is like oh you just made you (70:43 - 70:49)
know twenty thousand dollars on you know (70:45 - 70:51)
whatever like these brand new socks I'm (70:49 - 70:52)
just thinking of a Kickstarter I backed (70:51 - 70:54)
which might have been some socks it's (70:52 - 70:56)
not like that person just got twenty (70:54 - 70:57)
thousand dollars the person has to now (70:56 - 71:00)
make those sacks and fulfill those (70:57 - 71:01)
orders and ship them out and that costs (71:00 - 71:04)
money which that's what the Kickstarter (71:01 - 71:04)
pays for (71:04 - 71:06)
that's really why the why the (71:04 - 71:08)
Kickstarter is happening I don't know if (71:06 - 71:10)
I made any sense right now but I mean (71:08 - 71:11)
you kind of did but now it'll never (71:10 - 71:15)
happen because because I said elevation (71:11 - 71:17)
but yeah that's that's what it's going (71:15 - 71:19)
down for so uh hopefully that that's (71:17 - 71:21)
something that's cool for you guys like (71:19 - 71:22)
the last Kickstarter we did which is (71:21 - 71:25)
over two years ago was was what I what I (71:22 - 71:28)
thought pretty successful so we'll see I (71:25 - 71:30)
also know that some people don't like (71:28 - 71:33)
giving their money to patreon and they (71:30 - 71:35)
trust Kickstarter and so that's just (71:33 - 71:37)
another way for you know somebody to (71:35 - 71:39)
feel comfortable throwing five bucks our (71:37 - 71:41)
way and then getting some stickers in (71:39 - 71:44)
return I have so many it's super (71:41 - 71:47)
effective shirts from through the ages (71:44 - 71:50)
that I could probably go like a month (71:47 - 71:53)
only wearing it's super everyday wearing (71:50 - 71:56)
something is super yeah so I don't know (71:53 - 71:59)
that's it's exciting but maybe i'll make (71:56 - 72:02)
some like mythical stickers or something (71:59 - 72:05)
of the sort and have that as a as a (72:02 - 72:07)
kickstarter reward with patreon is just (72:05 - 72:10)
very hard to do physical rewards on that (72:07 - 72:11)
platform just the back end does it (72:10 - 72:14)
doesn't make it easy for that to happen (72:11 - 72:16)
that's why pretty much everything on our (72:14 - 72:19)
patreon is like digital-only of okay you (72:16 - 72:21)
get into slack okay you getting a slack (72:19 - 72:22)
but you get access to this channel okay (72:21 - 72:24)
you're getting the slack but you also (72:22 - 72:25)
get access to these downloads that are (72:24 - 72:27)
hidden behind a password stuff like that (72:25 - 72:31)
do like two more questions this is from (72:27 - 72:35)
Tommy from Columbus Ohio do your will I (72:31 - 72:38)
enjoy I enjoy it when Travis talks about (72:35 - 72:41)
philosophy love Tommy pS If any other (72:38 - 72:43)
listeners also enjoy Travis's Wow (72:41 - 72:46)
philosophy digressions go check out the (72:43 - 72:50)
podcast arbitrary archive where whoa (72:46 - 72:56)
where ontological and extra cents extra (72:50 - 72:58)
10 I can't say that musings reign (72:56 - 73:02)
supreme whoa I don't need it this is not (72:58 - 73:05)
my question is why was this addressed to (73:02 - 73:08)
me I think you said last week you didn't (73:05 - 73:10)
want to hear about Travis ramble I (73:08 - 73:12)
believe I said the opposite because (73:10 - 73:14)
Travis said he did not want to talk (73:12 - 73:16)
about hey Gillian dialectics and I said (73:14 - 73:17)
let's talk about hey Kelly (73:16 - 73:21)
dialectics I that is true I did opt out (73:17 - 73:25)
of the dialectic ah that's just not a (73:21 - 73:28)
particular area of interest of mine I (73:25 - 73:31)
don't think we've talked about ontology (73:28 - 73:34)
on arbitrary archive or web because it's (73:31 - 73:36)
just we talk about media I very much (73:34 - 73:40)
appreciate the free plug this it I know (73:36 - 73:42)
you're gonna think that this deplane oh (73:40 - 73:45)
yeah that this email writer is a plant (73:42 - 73:46)
especially given that they live in (73:45 - 73:48)
Columbus Ohio which is the same town (73:46 - 73:50)
where my brother the co-host of (73:48 - 73:54)
arbitrary archive also lives um but no (73:50 - 73:57)
that's that's not actually actually the (73:54 - 74:01)
case this was completely um on land I I (73:57 - 74:03)
appreciate the free plug for arbitrary (74:01 - 74:06)
archive we had a pretty good episode (74:03 - 74:07)
just go up what did we talk about I (74:06 - 74:09)
can't even remember it was all but I'm (74:07 - 74:11)
sure it was great it was that good you (74:09 - 74:13)
could remember we talked about a podcast (74:11 - 74:15)
called the infinite now and then the (74:13 - 74:19)
popular film out right now the lego (74:15 - 74:23)
batman movie Batman the old Batman (74:19 - 74:26)
Batman Batman not not Batman Batman give (74:23 - 74:29)
me like Superman and Aquaman is due in (74:26 - 74:33)
this spot the the great model here of (74:29 - 74:37)
spider-man I knit four semesters of Slav (74:33 - 74:41)
selasa fee how you guys let that DJ for (74:37 - 74:44)
civ 5 4 so that semesters of solazzo (74:41 - 74:47)
face as anyone who went to a Jesuit (74:44 - 74:48)
college or university is required to (74:47 - 74:50)
take four semesters of philosophy (74:48 - 74:54)
english wearing off on both of you yes I (74:50 - 74:56)
enjoy philosophy I did not enjoy those (74:54 - 74:58)
courses because one of the most painful (74:56 - 74:59)
things about taking college and (74:58 - 75:01)
university required philosophy courses (74:59 - 75:04)
is the people who will never ever be (75:01 - 75:06)
able to comprehend philosophy (75:04 - 75:08)
philosophical concepts being required to (75:06 - 75:11)
be in those classes with you it is true (75:08 - 75:13)
torture and I kept end Travis for (75:11 - 75:16)
getting past those beginning stages and (75:13 - 75:18)
into the higher levels of thought well (75:16 - 75:21)
it didn't ain't it ain't a cakewalk once (75:18 - 75:25)
you start getting only the pretentious (75:21 - 75:28)
what's a family friendly word I can use (75:25 - 75:31)
the pretentious (75:28 - 75:36)
dingbats that i mean i won't i won't say (75:31 - 75:38)
that that's true of all of my classmates (75:36 - 75:41)
because there were I'd met some friends (75:38 - 75:43)
and although the surprisingly small (75:41 - 75:45)
amount compared to my other major which (75:43 - 75:46)
was I made a lot more friends in the (75:45 - 75:47)
film department that I did in the (75:46 - 75:49)
philosophy department but the thing is (75:47 - 75:54)
you start to get the type of person who (75:49 - 75:58)
is not in philosophy anymore because (75:54 - 76:02)
they have well I mean this is me try (75:58 - 76:04)
this is an assumption on my part but (76:02 - 76:06)
from there from their actions it seems (76:04 - 76:08)
like they're not there to learn more (76:06 - 76:10)
about the subject matter they're just (76:08 - 76:12)
there to say heidegger's name a whole (76:10 - 76:15)
bunch which is kind of troubling but (76:12 - 76:17)
yeah you sure to give the type of person (76:15 - 76:19)
who just wants to be there to show that (76:17 - 76:23)
they do no philosophy things and because (76:19 - 76:25)
philosophy classes tend to be sort of (76:23 - 76:28)
open discussions they have free rein to (76:25 - 76:31)
just randomly all the conversation to (76:28 - 76:36)
whatever their specific ad (76:31 - 76:37)
area of expertise is which can be (76:36 - 76:39)
infuriating but it's a really rewarding (76:37 - 76:43)
discipline and it what's the best way to (76:39 - 76:47)
word it I think that through all of my (76:43 - 76:49)
years of studying philosophy I've never (76:47 - 76:51)
found something that precisely matches (76:49 - 76:55)
that I am totally convinced by like not (76:51 - 76:57)
nothing I saw I was like this is exactly (76:55 - 76:59)
how I see the world the way this (76:57 - 77:02)
philosopher things but I think it is (76:59 - 77:06)
very valuable to be presented very (77:02 - 77:10)
different seemingly strange and bizarre (77:06 - 77:12)
ways of seeing the world because (77:10 - 77:16)
challenging your own baked in tendencies (77:12 - 77:19)
of these like assumptions you make and (77:16 - 77:21)
intendin sees of interpretation I think (77:19 - 77:23)
rattling those cages a little bit can be (77:21 - 77:25)
a good exercise and philosophy is (77:23 - 77:27)
probably the best way to do that and and (77:25 - 77:29)
I agree and that's actually as the last (77:27 - 77:31)
thing I'll say on this one of the (77:29 - 77:33)
reasons why I typically do not discuss (77:31 - 77:36)
philosophy in public is that I tend to (77:33 - 77:38)
be much more comfortable exposing (77:36 - 77:41)
extreme points of view than people are (77:38 - 77:44)
comfortable with hearing them and people (77:41 - 77:46)
I tends to sometimes trigger emotional (77:44 - 77:49)
responses which definitely this is not (77:46 - 77:51)
the forum for getting into those kinds (77:49 - 77:54)
of conversations there you have it there (77:51 - 77:56)
you got there you have it Nicholas (77:54 - 77:59)
rights in from cornea Cora Noah (77:56 - 78:03)
California cornea nothing sure it's (77:59 - 78:05)
right next to pupil california go on (78:03 - 78:08)
probably next level seven 49th Palme ya (78:05 - 78:12)
isa a deer spj and company there has (78:08 - 78:14)
been an episode there has been episodes (78:12 - 78:17)
after episodes that upset me spj he's (78:14 - 78:21)
clearly a host of the show huh without (78:17 - 78:23)
him the show would not do as well I (78:21 - 78:25)
don't know about that I can clearly see (78:23 - 78:26)
all the hard work he does for the show (78:25 - 78:29)
and I feel more connected to him as I (78:26 - 78:31)
too cannot pronounce words let alone (78:29 - 78:33)
names of countless Pokemon this is not (78:31 - 78:36)
to be confused with not appreciating (78:33 - 78:38)
will or Travis because they do keep up (78:36 - 78:39)
the good work and I hope one day that I (78:38 - 78:41)
can make it to one of your live shows at (78:39 - 78:44)
a convention I don't have a question so (78:41 - 78:46)
you make up one for me if you want you (78:44 - 78:48)
can use my name I know for a fact I am (78:46 - 78:50)
the only Nick in (78:48 - 78:53)
or neah let alone all of California all (78:50 - 78:55)
right we'll make up a question what does (78:53 - 78:57)
make Citizen Kane so great well I would (78:55 - 79:04)
argue that haha the fact that the the (78:57 - 79:07)
formal elements really forced the (79:04 - 79:10)
audience into the interpretation that um (79:07 - 79:13)
that Wells wants the audience to come to (79:10 - 79:17)
our immaculate like think about how the (79:13 - 79:22)
the main journalist is is always framed (79:17 - 79:23)
from the back you're always looking over (79:22 - 79:25)
his shoulder and he's always poorly lit (79:23 - 79:29)
and and that's to get to prevent the (79:25 - 79:31)
audience from identifying with him in a (79:29 - 79:33)
meaningful way that to make sure the (79:31 - 79:34)
audience knows that he's just a cipher (79:33 - 79:36)
and that this is really Kane story and (79:34 - 79:38)
not to think that the Ark of the film is (79:36 - 79:41)
watching this journalist get information (79:38 - 79:43)
about Charles Foster Kane and instead is (79:41 - 79:46)
actually the arc of Kane himself and I (79:43 - 79:48)
think these little formal flourishes (79:46 - 79:52)
that lead to a very sharp and almost (79:48 - 79:55)
uniform interpretation regardless of who (79:52 - 79:58)
the audience is what makes it considered (79:55 - 79:59)
to be the best film of all time so you (79:58 - 80:01)
so you've missed the entire real (79:59 - 80:02)
question that we should be discussing (80:01 - 80:05)
which is moulin rouge is actually a (80:02 - 80:10)
better citizen kane than citizen oh oh (80:05 - 80:13)
here is this like home improvement where (80:10 - 80:17)
the neighborhood know you're gonna ask (80:13 - 80:18)
but no this isn't anything like home (80:17 - 80:20)
improvement you can't see his face until (80:18 - 80:23)
the very final episode yes that's (80:20 - 80:25)
exactly what this is all right good (80:23 - 80:30)
that's what I thought oh well too one (80:25 - 80:33)
more question just because uh we need a (80:30 - 80:35)
palate cleanser after yeah we can we (80:33 - 80:37)
can't and on citizen kane a jordan (80:35 - 80:39)
rights in from chris tri-cities (80:37 - 80:43)
Washington a comment from an earlier (80:39 - 80:46)
show asked what you would like to see in (80:43 - 80:48)
a future switch pokemon game and I (80:46 - 80:51)
wanted to voice my wants and I would (80:48 - 80:54)
like a whole 3d revamp yes I know this (80:51 - 80:57)
will likely happen now I know this will (80:54 - 80:59)
likely never happen but I would want a (80:57 - 81:01)
3d pokemon game where you would be able (80:59 - 81:03)
to walk around like pokemon XD (81:01 - 81:06)
TV pokemon in the grass we're like final (81:03 - 81:09)
fantasy 14 so it's not random encounters (81:06 - 81:11)
but you can still be surprised and (81:09 - 81:13)
whatnot I would also like 3d battles not (81:11 - 81:16)
like Pokemon not like pokin but like (81:13 - 81:19)
pokemon stadium or Coliseum I also would (81:16 - 81:23)
like to ask I love the TCG but I can (81:19 - 81:25)
only play digital versions because you (81:23 - 81:26)
can get packs for free sometimes but my (81:25 - 81:28)
mainly because it doesn't take a (81:26 - 81:31)
physical space I'm very disappointed I (81:28 - 81:33)
can't get into I can't get the pokemon (81:31 - 81:36)
TCG on my phone but I can get magic (81:33 - 81:38)
hearthstone yugioh etc how do you guys (81:36 - 81:40)
feel about the digital verse physical (81:38 - 81:42)
formats thanks for the show guys it's (81:40 - 81:44)
been a pleasure to listen each week (81:42 - 81:46)
Steve you are my favorite podcast host (81:44 - 81:49)
but will is the best also waiting to (81:46 - 81:52)
hear that eat that Travis email so I (81:49 - 81:54)
read this message boy because we're (81:52 - 81:56)
going to read the Travis email right now (81:54 - 81:59)
now I'm just no we're not doing it right (81:56 - 82:02)
now I'm still teasing it will get to (81:59 - 82:05)
travis's email eventually ah ok couple (82:02 - 82:08)
of things to break down it looks like (82:05 - 82:10)
Jordans concept was the whole seeing the (82:08 - 82:12)
Pokemon instead of random encounters a (82:10 - 82:14)
lot of games do this Final Fantasy 15 (82:12 - 82:18)
final fantasy 14 for some reason final (82:14 - 82:19)
fantasy games were the only thing (82:18 - 82:22)
sticking out on my mind but uh what do (82:19 - 82:24)
you guys feel about that I mean that's (82:22 - 82:27)
just adding to the verisimilitude of the (82:24 - 82:30)
pokemons experience so I'm all in favor (82:27 - 82:32)
I mean they do try something like that (82:30 - 82:35)
because on like pony island they have (82:32 - 82:37)
the shadows of the Pokemon running (82:35 - 82:39)
through the grass but it turns out to be (82:37 - 82:40)
like a primeape or something that comes (82:39 - 82:42)
after you and they have the shaking (82:40 - 82:44)
trees and something jumps out at you and (82:42 - 82:45)
they have the shadows of the bird (82:44 - 82:48)
Pokemon which actually started in jan 5 (82:45 - 82:51)
best gin so I mean it's just a sets a (82:48 - 82:53)
progressive step from that right where (82:51 - 82:55)
you have a more clearer representation (82:53 - 82:58)
of the pokemon that is you're about to (82:55 - 83:01)
encounter yeah we basically already have (82:58 - 83:04)
pokemon stadium or pokemon colosseum (83:01 - 83:07)
level battles (83:04 - 83:11)
because battles are in 3d now so we've (83:07 - 83:13)
got we got that one I think it's more (83:11 - 83:15)
like the camera movement and everything (83:13 - 83:19)
we have camera movements too but there (83:15 - 83:21)
are no cameras on the switch correct no (83:19 - 83:23)
no I mean like and not like physical (83:21 - 83:26)
cameras I mean like when you know I'm (83:23 - 83:27)
just saying that you you can't have an (83:26 - 83:29)
AR pokemon game on the switch because (83:27 - 83:31)
there's no cameras yeah yeah right (83:29 - 83:32)
that's correct I don't think the AI (83:31 - 83:34)
don't think AR is the question I like (83:32 - 83:37)
the I think the question asker just (83:34 - 83:40)
means a more cinematic battle yeah and (83:37 - 83:41)
we're clearly going that way right we're (83:40 - 83:43)
just not completely there yet even (83:41 - 83:45)
though i would i would say that it is (83:43 - 83:47)
probably doing things a lot better than (83:45 - 83:49)
stadium has but that's a that's a pretty (83:47 - 83:50)
old game but i get i get the concept (83:49 - 83:54)
right as fly the thing about the thing (83:50 - 83:58)
about foregoing random encounters in (83:54 - 84:01)
favor of style of something like Chrono (83:58 - 84:05)
Trigger where the monsters are already (84:01 - 84:09)
placed in the environment and you run up (84:05 - 84:13)
to them to start an encounter (84:09 - 84:15)
that I (84:13 - 84:19)
even in the sun and moon rendition of it (84:15 - 84:21)
like will was talking about and the gen (84:19 - 84:26)
5 version to it I don't think you can do (84:21 - 84:30)
that for even the majority let alone the (84:26 - 84:35)
entirety of encounters because Pokemon (84:30 - 84:38)
is so built around having a variety of (84:35 - 84:42)
Pokemon in each area that (84:38 - 84:45)
if you could see what (84:42 - 84:47)
Pokemon it was before you are about to (84:45 - 84:50)
interact with them I I think that kind (84:47 - 84:54)
of fundamentally breaks one of the core (84:50 - 84:57)
experiences of of playing pokemon and (84:54 - 85:02)
that's knowing that you can get a (84:57 - 85:08)
Pikachu in Viridian Forest and having to (85:02 - 85:11)
work to get that Pikachu because it's a (85:08 - 85:13)
low encounter rate right like if you (85:11 - 85:15)
could see oh no that's the silhouette of (85:13 - 85:17)
a Caterpie I'm gonna skip that that's a (85:15 - 85:18)
silhouette of them that upon I'm gonna (85:17 - 85:20)
skip that I think it fundamentally (85:18 - 85:22)
changes the game in a way that's a (85:20 - 85:24)
little less interest I mean it's it's (85:22 - 85:25)
certainly not more interesting and maybe (85:24 - 85:28)
the same but I don't I don't think it's (85:25 - 85:30)
necessary at least in my opinion do you (85:28 - 85:32)
agree two of you I think if you were (85:30 - 85:36)
that is this is like see Pokemon I you (85:32 - 85:38)
would probably need bigger areas to go (85:36 - 85:41)
okay there's a there's three or four (85:38 - 85:43)
caterpie's hanging out but then over (85:41 - 85:46)
here there's a chance for Pikachu to (85:43 - 85:48)
show up or something i'm just using your (85:46 - 85:50)
just piggybacking off your Viridian (85:48 - 85:55)
Forest concept whereas in something like (85:50 - 85:59)
final fantasy 14 or 15 or and maybe you (85:55 - 86:00)
can speak to chrono trigger Travis but (85:59 - 86:04)
those areas are so big that there's this (86:00 - 86:07)
there's this fog that happens so it's (86:04 - 86:10)
like well I can see pretty far and I can (86:07 - 86:12)
see these monsters in front of me but if (86:10 - 86:13)
I keep walking i'm not sure what's (86:12 - 86:15)
actually going to be over there until I (86:13 - 86:19)
get there and that's where you know the (86:15 - 86:21)
game could possibly generate other (86:19 - 86:25)
pokemon or whatnot or or certain pokemon (86:21 - 86:27)
are our timer like hey maybe a Pikachu (86:25 - 86:31)
only appears in this area you know every (86:27 - 86:33)
eight or nine hour so it's like okay (86:31 - 86:36)
well that makes a little more rare but (86:33 - 86:39)
now I know like oh I kill I accidentally (86:36 - 86:40)
knocked out this Pikachu but I know in (86:39 - 86:42)
about eight or nine hours that will that (86:40 - 86:44)
Pokemon will reappear again and I'll (86:42 - 86:46)
give me a chance to get it it's really (86:44 - 86:47)
the same concept you're just changing (86:46 - 86:49)
the frontal you're just changing the (86:47 - 86:52)
mechanics behind it of how Pokemon are (86:49 - 86:55)
encountered instead of the random chance (86:52 - 86:58)
of them being encountered I think both (86:55 - 87:00)
laser (86:58 - 87:03)
I would not be opposed of seeing it go (87:00 - 87:05)
down a newer route of okay I can see (87:03 - 87:07)
everything I can actively avoid (87:05 - 87:10)
something but if I want to engage I had (87:07 - 87:13)
that option yet the main problem that (87:10 - 87:15)
we're trying to solve is too many zoo (87:13 - 87:19)
bats I let me walk around the freaking (87:15 - 87:22)
zoo back thank you ah the other question (87:19 - 87:26)
Jordan asked was the how we feel about (87:22 - 87:30)
digital versus physical TCG's personally (87:26 - 87:32)
I can answer this really quick uh there (87:30 - 87:35)
is something really great and really (87:32 - 87:37)
special about sitting across the table (87:35 - 87:39)
from somebody you enjoy the company with (87:37 - 87:41)
and actually holding physical cards and (87:39 - 87:43)
that's something that you can't really (87:41 - 87:46)
reproduce in a digital format I think (87:43 - 87:48)
the digital format has the advantage of (87:46 - 87:51)
playing anytime anywhere like if I'm (87:48 - 87:53)
laying in bed at 2am i can open hearth (87:51 - 87:55)
stone and play as many games of (87:53 - 87:58)
hearthstone as i want whereas to am (87:55 - 88:00)
Willa sleeping and also doesn't live (87:58 - 88:03)
near me so I can't just ask him for a (88:00 - 88:07)
game of the pokemon TCG please don't ask (88:03 - 88:09)
me for anything at 2am thank you so I (88:07 - 88:12)
think they're both great I think they (88:09 - 88:17)
both digital card games aren't going to (88:12 - 88:19)
kill physical card games and and vice (88:17 - 88:21)
versa I think they both have have a (88:19 - 88:24)
medium and they both can happily exist (88:21 - 88:26)
together and I don't think there's a (88:24 - 88:28)
right or wrong way to play that ah it's (88:26 - 88:32)
just I think digital provides more (88:28 - 88:34)
convenience but if I have an option I (88:32 - 88:39)
think physical is more social more (88:34 - 88:41)
engaging I don't know there's just (88:39 - 88:43)
something about it that that a digital (88:41 - 88:45)
game can't really reproduce now I agree (88:43 - 88:48)
no consent right I don't play TCG's to (88:45 - 88:50)
win or lose I play TCG's to be social (88:48 - 88:53)
and to be around people so that's that (88:50 - 88:55)
would be completely lost in a digital (88:53 - 88:58)
format the only digital card games that (88:55 - 89:00)
I have enjoyed are the ones that were (88:58 - 89:02)
designed from the ground up to be (89:00 - 89:05)
digital card games I well I guess that's (89:02 - 89:08)
not true when I was younger I had a ball (89:05 - 89:11)
with whatever that PlayStation 1 yugioh (89:08 - 89:13)
game was (89:11 - 89:16)
running that strange example generally I (89:13 - 89:20)
don't you know I when I was into magic I (89:16 - 89:23)
didn't really like the magic online (89:20 - 89:26)
stuff I even though I've never really (89:23 - 89:29)
been into the pokemon TCG that deeply (89:26 - 89:32)
I've dabbled a little bit and play TCG (89:29 - 89:34)
oh is that what it's called i think so (89:32 - 89:37)
and I was never really into that the (89:34 - 89:39)
only just like I said the only digital (89:37 - 89:40)
card games I've liked other ones that (89:39 - 89:43)
are built for it so hearthstone the (89:40 - 89:46)
Elder Scrolls card game isn't bad I (89:43 - 89:48)
haven't played gwent but I know people (89:46 - 89:51)
really like the card game within the (89:48 - 89:55)
witcher which is called gwent and the (89:51 - 89:58)
reason is that those games can utilize (89:55 - 90:00)
mechanics that are really only available (89:58 - 90:03)
within the digital space so think things (90:00 - 90:07)
like being able to produce a randomly (90:03 - 90:10)
generated number without having to (90:07 - 90:13)
resort to dice rolls you can't really do (90:10 - 90:15)
that in a card game unless like I said (90:13 - 90:16)
you do a coin flip or a dice roll which (90:15 - 90:18)
gets cumbersome then you have to carry (90:16 - 90:21)
all these dice or coins with you which (90:18 - 90:22)
is unfortunate because you're already (90:21 - 90:25)
carrying all of your cards but able to (90:22 - 90:27)
just quickly do that or cards that have (90:25 - 90:30)
so thinking about hearthstone there are (90:27 - 90:31)
some cards that have effects where like (90:30 - 90:34)
you pretty profoundly change the state (90:31 - 90:36)
of the game car if you know hearthstone (90:34 - 90:39)
cards like lord jaraxxus that replaces (90:36 - 90:43)
your hero like that good that card is (90:39 - 90:46)
very complicated in its effect like it (90:43 - 90:48)
would be very difficult to tie it to (90:46 - 90:50)
like write all of the effects of that (90:48 - 90:54)
card has on a physical card but it works (90:50 - 90:55)
in hearthstone because you don't really (90:54 - 90:57)
need to explain all that because the (90:55 - 91:01)
game does a lot of that action for you (90:57 - 91:04)
and I think when when digital card games (91:01 - 91:05)
are able to just be digital they can (91:04 - 91:07)
take advantage of those elements but (91:05 - 91:10)
when their physical card games first you (91:07 - 91:11)
sort of just get the worst of both (91:10 - 91:15)
worlds we still have a ton of emails but (91:11 - 91:17)
running out of time so if we didn't get (91:15 - 91:18)
your email we will eventually get to it (91:17 - 91:21)
I have everything now organized to make (91:18 - 91:23)
sure I don't miss emails so if you want (91:21 - 91:25)
to send in an email you can do so at SBJ (91:23 - 91:27)
at pkmn cast (91:25 - 91:29)
or you can go to Pokemon podcast calm (91:27 - 91:32)
and hit that contact button and send in (91:29 - 91:34)
any emails related or not related (91:32 - 91:37)
pokemon as the segment proves we'll talk (91:34 - 91:39)
about anything so what we'll do is we'll (91:37 - 91:42)
take one more quick break and we'll come (91:39 - 91:44)
back Travis will do pokemon of the week (91:42 - 91:45)
we'll do some housecleaning and we'll (91:44 - 91:46)
wrap up the show so we will be right (91:45 - 91:50)
back up tons of fun dance a Big Damn (91:46 - 91:54)
dance I've done a fun dance a big damn (91:50 - 91:58)
dance I've done a fun dance a big dan (91:54 - 92:01)
dance abundance (91:58 - 92:01)
[Music] (92:02 - 92:05)
abundance (92:29 - 92:33)
[Music] (92:30 - 92:33)
abundance (92:59 - 93:02)
[Music] (93:03 - 93:07)
[Music] (93:11 - 93:15)
and we are back from our break I guess I (93:26 - 93:34)
mean I have nothing really to say I'm (93:31 - 93:36)
gonna toss over to Travis and they're (93:34 - 93:39)
going to do pokemon of the week and I'll (93:36 - 93:44)
come back and give you some facts our (93:39 - 93:48)
pokemon of the week this week is a (93:44 - 93:51)
generation 5 rock-type pokemon that of (93:48 - 93:54)
course is giggle a--the giggle a--the in (93:51 - 93:57)
gen 7 has the ability sand stream which (93:54 - 94:01)
calls upon sandstorm as giggle if is (93:57 - 94:04)
sent out into battle I will be frank and (94:01 - 94:06)
say that I have never used a giggle with (94:04 - 94:09)
on my team in gen seven so I don't have (94:06 - 94:11)
a lot of expertise using it so because (94:09 - 94:13)
of that instead of having me ramble on (94:11 - 94:15)
about the strategy of using it I'm going (94:13 - 94:17)
to give you three as opposed to the (94:15 - 94:20)
usual to move sets for giggle if because (94:17 - 94:22)
I wouldn't have a lot to add because it (94:20 - 94:25)
don't really feel like I know enough (94:22 - 94:26)
about the Pokemon to give you that (94:25 - 94:28)
meaningful of information so other (94:26 - 94:30)
people are going to do that through me (94:28 - 94:33)
because i am a strange puppet a first (94:30 - 94:35)
set comes from frequent pokemon of the (94:33 - 94:38)
week contributor kevin AKA koopa bras (94:35 - 94:43)
that's an adamant nature with 250 2 v's (94:38 - 94:46)
in HP and attack with the remaining four (94:43 - 94:47)
and special defense your item is going (94:46 - 94:49)
to be leftovers and of course sands (94:47 - 94:52)
stream is your ability the move set here (94:49 - 94:55)
is earthquake rockslide curse and (94:52 - 94:58)
explosion have it having a move set (94:55 - 95:01)
without protect is obviously a little (94:58 - 95:05)
riskier but we're obviously using a (95:01 - 95:07)
pretty risky set here in the first place (95:05 - 95:09)
because we're running explosion (95:07 - 95:12)
rockslide is there because it hits both (95:09 - 95:15)
opponents and is the same type attack (95:12 - 95:19)
bonus move curse is great because it (95:15 - 95:21)
allows you to either synergize with or (95:19 - 95:23)
counter trick room giggle with is (95:21 - 95:25)
already very slow so being able to slow (95:23 - 95:28)
yourself down more makes sure that you (95:25 - 95:32)
are able to go first under effects of (95:28 - 95:34)
brook room earthquake is just good (95:32 - 95:37)
coverage our next set comes from mark (95:34 - 95:41)
AKA what's mark's lat (95:37 - 95:45)
marshmallows yeah yeah marshmallow loaf (95:41 - 95:49)
and that is an adamant nature this one (95:45 - 95:51)
actually is not going to use sand stream (95:49 - 95:55)
so you would use this for the you would (95:51 - 95:57)
use the abilities the ability sturdy (95:55 - 95:59)
here your Eevee's are going to be the (95:57 - 96:03)
same as the one from before with attack (95:59 - 96:05)
HP on the remaining foreign special (96:03 - 96:07)
defense your item is going to be (96:05 - 96:09)
leftovers then the move set is protect (96:07 - 96:13)
Stone Edge Smackdown earthquake mark (96:09 - 96:15)
says the first slot is protect to see (96:13 - 96:16)
what your opponent's working with (96:15 - 96:18)
earthquakes high base power tends to (96:16 - 96:20)
make short work of a lot of Pokemon (96:18 - 96:22)
Stone Edge while only being eighty (96:20 - 96:24)
percent accurate is very effective for (96:22 - 96:26)
giggle if and SmackDown can assist with (96:24 - 96:29)
flying types if you're paired with a (96:26 - 96:32)
round type Pokemon Smackdown is a really (96:29 - 96:34)
interesting move by the way of being (96:32 - 96:36)
able to make flying types or like (96:34 - 96:39)
pokemon with levitate no longer immune (96:36 - 96:41)
to ground types can be a pretty powerful (96:39 - 96:45)
a fact fun fact of Z guards move (96:41 - 96:48)
thousand arrows it's what it's called (96:45 - 96:51)
the signature move of of zygarde also (96:48 - 96:54)
has that same effect it can hit but it (96:51 - 96:57)
can hit flying types just with that move (96:54 - 96:59)
so that's pretty cool too unrelated (96:57 - 97:02)
though and then the third set comes to (96:59 - 97:08)
us from Brandon aka Brandon to 1486 and (97:02 - 97:10)
that set is going to also use sand (97:08 - 97:12)
stream this time we're going to use (97:10 - 97:14)
rocky MZ so we're going to be able to (97:12 - 97:17)
use the rock z move yuri these are going (97:14 - 97:21)
to be 244 and HP 252 an attack and then (97:17 - 97:24)
the remaining 12 in special defense this (97:21 - 97:26)
is going to be a brave nature and this (97:24 - 97:31)
is a more this is a pretty typical set (97:26 - 97:32)
that you would see it's Stone Edge (97:31 - 97:36)
earthquake rockslide and protect the (97:32 - 97:40)
brave nature and zero speed investment (97:36 - 97:44)
allows you to be as as Brandon says (97:40 - 97:48)
quote faster unquote in trick room so (97:44 - 97:51)
another way to take advantage of or or (97:48 - 97:54)
counter a truck room with that fairly (97:51 - 97:57)
offensive move set there like i said i (97:54 - 98:00)
don't i'm not confident and to give you (97:57 - 98:02)
a lot more information than these folks (98:00 - 98:04)
already have about Google Earth so I'll (98:02 - 98:08)
just end it there alright and if you get (98:04 - 98:11)
a shiny giggle if it has blue crystals (98:08 - 98:15)
on it instead of the red crystals giggle (98:11 - 98:17)
a--the was first seen in a triple battle (98:15 - 98:19)
with teammates reuniclus and goth Attell (98:17 - 98:21)
against a blitz ille dharmana tan and (98:19 - 98:25)
drill bur during the oh ha suta episode (98:21 - 98:28)
which aired jun 27th it was not revealed (98:25 - 98:33)
until August seventh 2010 so that was (98:28 - 98:35)
what almost two months before we knew (98:33 - 98:37)
what giggle was even though we saw it (98:35 - 98:38)
early not really that great of trivia (98:37 - 98:42)
but Google is the only pure rock type (98:38 - 98:45)
third stage Pokemon and giggle us (98:42 - 98:47)
evolutionary lion's share similarities (98:45 - 98:50)
with golems family both of them are rock (98:47 - 98:51)
type both learned stealth rocks (98:50 - 98:54)
Smackdown explosion Stone Edge and rock (98:51 - 98:56)
blast by leveling up first of all that (98:54 - 98:59)
25 final evolutionary stage by trading (98:56 - 99:02)
giggle it seems to be based on a crystal (98:59 - 99:06)
formation good old gen 5 pokemon i (99:02 - 99:08)
really like giggle if it's cool it had a (99:06 - 99:12)
really cool TCG card when i played there (99:08 - 99:15)
it would do 20 times the amount of (99:12 - 99:17)
damage sorry like losing my voice twenty (99:15 - 99:19)
times the amount of damage per fighting (99:17 - 99:22)
energy on it na plus i think it started (99:19 - 99:25)
with a base 20 so you could do a hundred (99:22 - 99:28)
damage with for fighting energy and (99:25 - 99:30)
anyone who played the TCG that's a lot (99:28 - 99:33)
of energy to apply to a Pokemon usually (99:30 - 99:34)
most Pokemon are like one double (99:33 - 99:36)
colorless and then one other energy and (99:34 - 99:39)
you kind of go off there or use other (99:36 - 99:40)
cards to get energy I'm faster but there (99:39 - 99:42)
was a card in the game there was an (99:40 - 99:45)
electrode in the game where electrodes (99:42 - 99:48)
ability was to commit suicide like to (99:45 - 99:50)
blow up and that would give your (99:48 - 99:52)
opponent a prize card because in terms (99:50 - 99:54)
electro fainted so they get a prize card (99:52 - 99:56)
for every pok√©mon that faints on your (99:54 - 100:00)
side but in return by sacrificing (99:56 - 100:03)
electrode you would reveal the top I (100:00 - 100:05)
think 10 cards of your deck and for (100:03 - 100:07)
every energy you found you could (100:05 - 100:08)
instantly attach it to a poke (100:07 - 100:10)
so what you could do is you could (100:08 - 100:12)
explode electrode hope that you get (100:10 - 100:14)
energy cards attached them to giggle if (100:12 - 100:16)
and then all of a sudden your usual if (100:14 - 100:18)
goes from zero to a hundred instantly (100:16 - 100:21)
there was also a card in the game called (100:18 - 100:24)
twins which lets you let you find any (100:21 - 100:26)
two cards in your deck that you wanted (100:24 - 100:30)
as long as you had more prizes than your (100:26 - 100:32)
opponent basically as long as you were (100:30 - 100:34)
losing the match so by forcing your (100:32 - 100:36)
electro to explode you give your (100:34 - 100:38)
opponent one prize card but now you can (100:36 - 100:40)
use this card that lets you find any two (100:38 - 100:41)
cards in your deck which is extremely (100:40 - 100:43)
powerful so you could find something (100:41 - 100:46)
like you could pretty much find a card (100:43 - 100:47)
that would help you look at the top (100:46 - 100:49)
cards of your deck in it like arrange (100:47 - 100:52)
them in a way when you exploded or not (100:49 - 100:54)
when you exploded but when it pretty (100:52 - 100:56)
much obviously because that's after the (100:54 - 100:59)
fact but it sets you up for the the fact (100:56 - 101:01)
that trying to get the the deck to work (100:59 - 101:04)
it was really cool but yeah that's like (101:01 - 101:05)
morn my fondest memories with giggle (101:04 - 101:08)
a--the was that that deck I used and (101:05 - 101:10)
this is why we don't discuss TCG's in (101:08 - 101:13)
the program because trying to get these (101:10 - 101:16)
concepts across in a non visual medium (101:13 - 101:20)
is very difficult yeah yeah I do want to (101:16 - 101:22)
go I do want to say though like I have (101:20 - 101:23)
no hate of the TCG it's just a very (101:22 - 101:26)
expensive time-consuming hobby it is (101:23 - 101:28)
really great oh yeah that's giggle (101:26 - 101:33)
a--the all right some house cleaning you (101:28 - 101:35)
guys made this segment it was all you (101:33 - 101:38)
you did this I've been adding more stuff (101:35 - 101:41)
to the Pokemon podcast youtube channel (101:38 - 101:45)
so just youtube / PKM and cast I've been (101:41 - 101:49)
doing this new thing where I take one to (101:45 - 101:50)
two-minute clips from the podcast and (101:49 - 101:54)
turn them into mini YouTube episodes to (101:50 - 101:57)
see how that works and facebook seems to (101:54 - 101:59)
prioritize video on that platform so (101:57 - 102:02)
seeing if it works there too just (101:59 - 102:05)
because my my home and if I'm giving you (102:02 - 102:07)
guys homework this week and I'm sorry (102:05 - 102:09)
but my homework for you guys this week (102:07 - 102:12)
is to tell one friend about our show and (102:09 - 102:16)
I think by doing these many episodes (102:12 - 102:18)
it's a great way of going like hey this (102:16 - 102:20)
might be something you're interested in (102:18 - 102:22)
or hey look at these guys (102:20 - 102:24)
funny because I know when somebody looks (102:22 - 102:27)
at a podcast and they see 200 some (102:24 - 102:29)
episodes and I see that episodes or 90 (102:27 - 102:31)
plus minutes that might be intimidating (102:29 - 102:32)
that might be a turn-off that might be (102:31 - 102:35)
like where do I start where there's so (102:32 - 102:38)
much here to go from so having these one (102:35 - 102:41)
to two-minute clips really hope i really (102:38 - 102:44)
hope shines a certain part of our (102:41 - 102:45)
podcast that makes it a little bit (102:44 - 102:48)
easier to get into if if you tell a (102:45 - 102:50)
friend that might not be in the podcast (102:48 - 102:54)
but maybe love Pokemon so that's really (102:50 - 102:55)
where we're going with that I do plan on (102:54 - 102:57)
doing some more pokemon center reviews (102:55 - 103:01)
on youtube so and they one or two of (102:57 - 103:03)
them will involve a giveaway so just (103:01 - 103:05)
like a common obviously watch the video (103:03 - 103:10)
hit the subscribe button comment and so (103:05 - 103:12)
trying something with that and with (103:10 - 103:14)
pokemon day and everything coming up (103:12 - 103:17)
hopefully I I can set some time aside to (103:14 - 103:19)
stream something to celebrate pokemon (103:17 - 103:23)
day will Travis and I will all be at PAX (103:19 - 103:25)
in Boston I believe that is March 9th if (103:23 - 103:28)
I am not mistaken and we will be that's (103:25 - 103:29)
one really fly out but I think March (103:28 - 103:33)
isn't March ESR actual yeah that isn't a (103:29 - 103:35)
shin at two thirty to thirty in the (103:33 - 103:37)
Bobcat theater I was told that it's the (103:35 - 103:39)
dentist favorite time so just remember (103:37 - 103:43)
that and you remember to 30 okay that (103:39 - 103:46)
fits 400 people that I've been told so (103:43 - 103:49)
400 spots there and it is not being (103:46 - 103:51)
streamed so if you cannot make it two (103:49 - 103:53)
packs or you are not in the Boston area (103:51 - 103:56)
and we will be recording that I'm not (103:53 - 103:57)
sure exactly how I'm going to record (103:56 - 103:58)
that yet I will figure out a way (103:57 - 104:00)
probably just check an extra bag of (103:58 - 104:02)
luggage of audio equipment yeah that'll (104:00 - 104:04)
be all great that'll be something I'm (104:02 - 104:06)
really excited for this is the first (104:04 - 104:08)
time the three of us have done a panel (104:06 - 104:10)
together Irene will be there she'll (104:08 - 104:12)
actually be am really pumped yeah she'll (104:10 - 104:14)
actually be helping do the panel we I (104:12 - 104:16)
actually have a really cool concept that (104:14 - 104:17)
involves a lot of audience participation (104:16 - 104:19)
so I'm going to put her to work of (104:17 - 104:22)
running around and making everything (104:19 - 104:25)
moves smoothly but we'll all be there so (104:22 - 104:27)
they'll be really exciting and I think I (104:25 - 104:29)
don't I know Nick was planning something (104:27 - 104:31)
of a meat out outside if you if you (104:29 - 104:33)
