I caught three shiny love disc and I am (0:36 - 0:39)

Valentine's Day I don't think I'm gonna (0:39 - 0:42)
be able to keep this love ball balanced (0:41 - 0:44)
on my head the entire podcast but I (0:42 - 0:47)
wanted to start (0:44 - 0:47)
for our audio listeners just has a (0:47 - 0:53)
Pokeball on her head that's it (0:51 - 0:55)
I feel like Hannah's determined to get (0:53 - 0:57)
people to come to the YouTube She's (0:55 - 1:00)
she's purposely changing locations for (0:57 - 1:02)
you all that's right now she's in Alaska (1:00 - 1:04)
you can't see it but there's a polar (1:02 - 1:07)
bear behind her I don't have anywhere to (1:04 - 1:08)
put the love ball except for on top of (1:07 - 1:09)
my head (1:08 - 1:12)
so I wanted it to be in the podcast (1:09 - 1:15)
[Laughter] (1:12 - 1:17)
um Bobby is also here with us I only got (1:15 - 1:20)
one shiny love disc yesterday but I did (1:17 - 1:23)
get a shiny tapu Lele today after only a (1:20 - 1:28)
few 34 raids so that's only 34. (1:23 - 1:31)
that's that's like the cost of sun and (1:28 - 1:34)
moon right there Bobby yeah well (1:31 - 1:37)
yep and now I get to look at it and on (1:34 - 1:39)
my phone and uh (1:37 - 1:40)
then that's that's it then I'll forget (1:39 - 1:43)
about it until uh perfect until next (1:40 - 1:45)
year (1:43 - 1:45)
um cool well uh we have a show for you (1:45 - 1:50)
guys today this is gonna be really weird (1:48 - 1:51)
especially if you're watching the (1:50 - 1:52)
YouTube version because next week we're (1:51 - 1:53)
probably gonna be in the same clothes (1:52 - 1:54)
because we're recording two episodes (1:53 - 1:55)
today (1:54 - 1:58)
um main reason is I will be in Las Vegas (1:55 - 2:02)
for the Hoenn tour (1:58 - 2:03)
um and we'll probably have like a bonus (2:02 - 2:06)
episode for that as well (2:03 - 2:10)
so uh a lot of editing for me a lot of (2:06 - 2:11)
recording for me but we want to make (2:10 - 2:13)
sure that the episodes get out to you (2:11 - 2:14)
every Monday (2:13 - 2:16)
also we'll Circle back to the love disc (2:14 - 2:18)
stuff when we get to our Pokemon go (2:16 - 2:20)
segment uh before we get to our Pokemon (2:18 - 2:22)
go segment (2:20 - 2:24)
um (2:22 - 2:26)
let's start off with what we talked (2:24 - 2:28)
about last week which (2:26 - 2:31)
at the surprise that this is news (2:28 - 2:33)
actually like a good surprise not like (2:31 - 2:35)
oh my I can't believe they did this is (2:33 - 2:40)
like oh I'm very glad they did this so (2:35 - 2:41)
we'll start off with some play Pokemon (2:40 - 2:46)
news uh last week there was the Florida (2:41 - 2:48)
reach Florida Regional regionals I think (2:46 - 2:51)
that's what it's called I think so yeah (2:48 - 2:55)
yeah where they had uh VGC TCG (2:51 - 2:57)
Pokemon go if you guys don't follow the (2:55 - 2:59)
competitive stuff Pokemon go is done in (2:57 - 3:00)
like 10 minutes because it's literally (2:59 - 3:02)
the world's fastest game like that (3:00 - 3:04)
you're done so fast and there aren't as (3:02 - 3:06)
many players (3:04 - 3:08)
that's true yeah that's true they're (3:06 - 3:09)
very they're very efficient over there (3:08 - 3:11)
in the Pokemon go scene (3:09 - 3:14)
and at a little bit of History here at a (3:11 - 3:16)
certain point the TCG stuff got so big (3:14 - 3:19)
they had to restructure how it worked (3:16 - 3:21)
because people were playing all day (3:19 - 3:23)
matches were taking so long (3:21 - 3:25)
they restructured it (3:23 - 3:28)
um and then there was a a problem at the (3:25 - 3:30)
Florida regionals where (3:28 - 3:34)
uh the first day took 14 hours for (3:30 - 3:35)
competitors (3:34 - 3:39)
for VGC for VGC TCG under this new (3:35 - 3:41)
format they get done when they get like (3:39 - 3:43)
efficient as efficient as they can be (3:41 - 3:45)
obviously (3:43 - 3:49)
um and the people who may there was (3:45 - 3:52)
there was also there was 10 rounds and (3:49 - 3:54)
there were some people who went eight (3:52 - 3:56)
and two (3:54 - 3:58)
which is usually guaranteeing you into (3:56 - 4:00)
the next day but there was a a whole (3:58 - 4:01)
bunch of people that went eight and two (4:00 - 4:05)
that did not qualify for day two at all (4:01 - 4:09)
so imagine waking up playing 10 rounds (4:05 - 4:13)
of Pokemon VGC for 14 hours going 8-2 (4:09 - 4:17)
and then being like well I I I don't (4:13 - 4:20)
make day two that's a very long day to (4:17 - 4:22)
find out that you are not participating (4:20 - 4:24)
and then even worse if you did make day (4:22 - 4:28)
two see you bright and early at 7 30 a.m (4:24 - 4:31)
to play even more Pokemon (4:28 - 4:33)
and after the 12 hours of playing you (4:31 - 4:36)
still had to get your team checked that (4:33 - 4:38)
evening right for the next day (4:36 - 4:39)
yeah (4:38 - 4:41)
it was a long day is what it sounded (4:39 - 4:42)
like (4:41 - 4:44)
terrible (4:42 - 4:46)
uh and I I said this on Twitter I (4:44 - 4:49)
tweeted this like this was this not this (4:46 - 4:52)
specific issue but when I was playing (4:49 - 4:55)
TCG competitively for three years this (4:52 - 4:58)
is one of the reasons why I stopped you (4:55 - 5:00)
would you would get there super early (4:58 - 5:02)
they said they were going to start at (5:00 - 5:05)
nine something went wrong all of a (5:02 - 5:06)
sudden you're not starting till 11 so (5:05 - 5:08)
you're just sitting there and you're (5:06 - 5:11)
like okay well if I knew that we're (5:08 - 5:12)
gonna start at 11 I would have slept in (5:11 - 5:14)
an hour I would have like had a bigger (5:12 - 5:16)
breakfast (5:14 - 5:18)
um I'm sure many people might have (5:16 - 5:20)
considered taking a shower that would (5:18 - 5:22)
have been beneficial to everyone uh and (5:20 - 5:24)
then you would you would you would (5:22 - 5:26)
either have two things you would either (5:24 - 5:29)
uh like go to time and then as soon as (5:26 - 5:30)
your match is over you're in another (5:29 - 5:33)
match or you would just get (5:30 - 5:36)
swept right away and then (5:33 - 5:38)
I mean it sucks that you lost but it's (5:36 - 5:40)
like well at least I have now like a 20 (5:38 - 5:42)
minute break to like catch up and like (5:40 - 5:43)
breathe (5:42 - 5:44)
uh (5:43 - 5:47)
tournaments the tournament structure can (5:44 - 5:49)
I'm I'm sure this applies to a lot of (5:47 - 5:52)
games it's just a very exhausting thing (5:49 - 5:54)
to participate in yeah (5:52 - 5:57)
anyways the news actually out of all of (5:54 - 5:59)
this is that play Pokemon tweeted (5:57 - 6:02)
attention Pokemon VG trainers following (5:59 - 6:05)
on our upcoming quarterly document (6:02 - 6:08)
updated on February 21st VG Regional (6:05 - 6:10)
championships will use the two-day (6:08 - 6:13)
tournament structure as the Pokemon TCG (6:10 - 6:15)
events play Pokemon tournament (6:13 - 6:17)
um rulebook handbook and then they just (6:15 - 6:19)
they link to like the handbook and the (6:17 - 6:21)
rule structure (6:19 - 6:24)
um so that's great that's super good and (6:21 - 6:27)
I believe there was probably enough I (6:24 - 6:28)
don't think it was a coincidence that (6:27 - 6:30)
this came out shortly after the disaster (6:28 - 6:32)
that was a 14-hour tournament day in (6:30 - 6:33)
Florida (6:32 - 6:35)
um because they tweeted uh this was like (6:33 - 6:38)
Monday or Tuesday earlier this week (6:35 - 6:41)
that they're making these changes now (6:38 - 6:43)
so they're immediate like the next (6:41 - 6:45)
tournament is going to be (6:43 - 6:49)
changed okay it went wrong enough yeah (6:45 - 6:54)
let's change things for next time (6:49 - 6:54)
uh yes that's good I think (6:54 - 7:01)
um the Australian (6:58 - 7:05)
regionals is next on the list that (7:01 - 7:06)
sounds right yeah (7:05 - 7:10)
and then I think Tennessee has one and (7:06 - 7:12)
New Jersey I don't know (7:10 - 7:14)
um (7:12 - 7:14)
yeah there come to San Diego for that (7:15 - 7:20)
event San Diego was the first one yeah (7:18 - 7:22)
neither of you came to San Diego right (7:20 - 7:25)
no no okay I'm pretty I'm pretty I know (7:22 - 7:26)
I know you're there Bobby I'm pretty (7:25 - 7:29)
over San Diego at this point (7:26 - 7:31)
hey San Diego is great it's just that (7:29 - 7:34)
that area of San Diego not so great (7:31 - 7:36)
yeah I went real real real downhill (7:34 - 7:39)
during the pandemic it really did I (7:36 - 7:39)
didn't even know I hadn't been there (7:39 - 7:41)
downtown in three years and I live a (7:39 - 7:43)
mile away from downtown (7:41 - 7:45)
but I hadn't actually been down there uh (7:43 - 7:47)
for anything it's changed it's changed (7:45 - 7:51)
yeah a lot of places have yep (7:47 - 7:53)
um just uh for for those that don't know (7:51 - 7:56)
how the the TCG structure works the (7:53 - 7:58)
easiest way I can explain it is if you (7:56 - 8:00)
have three losses you're automatically (7:58 - 8:01)
out (8:00 - 8:03)
um so whether there are eight rounds or (8:01 - 8:05)
ten rounds (8:03 - 8:07)
um the it kind of (8:05 - 8:11)
consolidates and is easier to get like a (8:07 - 8:15)
top 16 or top 32 depending so there's (8:11 - 8:16)
like a point structure and whatnot but (8:15 - 8:18)
pretty much like if you have three (8:16 - 8:20)
losses the likelihood of you making day (8:18 - 8:22)
two is next to Impossible unless I don't (8:20 - 8:24)
know like 10 people in top eight got (8:22 - 8:27)
like food poisoning and like they need (8:24 - 8:29)
to like move people up (8:27 - 8:32)
laughs (8:29 - 8:32)
so (8:32 - 8:37)
um hopefully that makes it better uh (8:34 - 8:40)
um again I've (8:37 - 8:42)
I understand how exhausting it is both (8:40 - 8:45)
mentally and physically to sit there for (8:42 - 8:48)
14 hours and like Pokemon is already a (8:45 - 8:52)
mind melting game at a high level (8:48 - 8:54)
yeah that's true that's true are you (8:52 - 8:56)
thinking about doing any (8:54 - 8:59)
competitive this year I you know I've (8:56 - 9:01)
I've been so distracted in in scarlet (8:59 - 9:03)
and Violet from like raid stuff (9:01 - 9:05)
um like I (9:03 - 9:07)
I've gotten a bunch of shinies and (9:05 - 9:09)
people are always like oh you must use (9:07 - 9:10)
the sandwich power a lot and I was like (9:09 - 9:12)
no all these shinies are just like (9:10 - 9:14)
like the Eevee training they're just out (9:12 - 9:16)
there yeah they're just out there I just (9:14 - 9:17)
run into them um so I haven't really (9:16 - 9:21)
like in-depth shiny hunt I did do some (9:17 - 9:23)
uh I did like two or three days of (9:21 - 9:26)
ladder in VGC with a rental team and I (9:23 - 9:29)
was having a good time with it uh but I (9:26 - 9:31)
haven't gone back so (9:29 - 9:34)
the The Raid stuff is (9:31 - 9:36)
time consuming in a good way like it's (9:34 - 9:39)
it's like a good like I like doing my (9:36 - 9:40)
six star every day I like helping people (9:39 - 9:42)
with their six stars I like prepping for (9:40 - 9:44)
these Seven Stars I like grinding out (9:42 - 9:46)
the Seven Stars so (9:44 - 9:48)
um I have not delved too deep into the (9:46 - 9:51)
VGC stuff and the raid builds are (9:48 - 9:53)
typically things that would not be good (9:51 - 9:54)
competitively right so you're building (9:53 - 9:56)
all these Pokemon out for grin and Jeff (9:54 - 9:59)
for Charizard for cinderace and teaching (9:56 - 10:01)
people all that but you're not but it's (9:59 - 10:02)
not like you can turn around and use (10:01 - 10:04)
that stuff in competitive right so it's (10:02 - 10:06)
like you gotta build those teams (10:04 - 10:08)
completely separate from the raid teams (10:06 - 10:11)
yeah yeah most of the red builds are (10:08 - 10:13)
like really bulky which is is (10:11 - 10:15)
um you know survivability in raids is is (10:13 - 10:17)
what you really want (10:15 - 10:19)
um usually in like VGC stuff your things (10:17 - 10:22)
are invested in speed because you need (10:19 - 10:25)
to out speed certain things because (10:22 - 10:25)
going first is very important in PGC (10:25 - 10:30)
stuff hey rides it doesn't matter if you (10:29 - 10:32)
go first because the the boss is like I (10:30 - 10:34)
get to go twice before you even get to (10:32 - 10:39)
pick a move yeah yep yep (10:34 - 10:39)
yeah they added a new in-depth thing (10:39 - 10:43)
that adds a whole lot for people who (10:41 - 10:45)
didn't like competitive that if you want (10:43 - 10:47)
to build a Pokemon but never ended up (10:45 - 10:49)
playing in competitive to begin with now (10:47 - 10:50)
there's a good way to do that but if (10:49 - 10:51)
you're someone who tries to do (10:50 - 10:53)
everything there's a whole lot more to (10:51 - 10:55)
do now (10:53 - 10:57)
yep yeah it's it's a good problem to (10:55 - 11:00)
have for sure (10:57 - 11:00)
yeah (11:00 - 11:02)
um I feel like that was that whole (11:00 - 11:04)
situation was made for someone like me (11:02 - 11:06)
because I don't like it's the same thing (11:04 - 11:08)
with like go right you know PVP I don't (11:06 - 11:11)
play PVP so everything I build or power (11:08 - 11:14)
up is specifically for raids but it's (11:11 - 11:16)
like oh now I gotta go build up a team (11:14 - 11:18)
for PVP like no it's okay I'll just I'll (11:16 - 11:20)
just stick to my raids and stay away (11:18 - 11:25)
from the I always aspire to PVP but uh (11:20 - 11:27)
never end up doing it so I'm enjoying (11:25 - 11:28)
being able to build Pokemon for the (11:27 - 11:32)
raids yep exactly I think I think it is (11:28 - 11:33)
nice I think (11:32 - 11:36)
I I can definitely see the excitement (11:33 - 11:38)
um at least in in the community we've (11:36 - 11:40)
built of people being like I've never (11:38 - 11:42)
done EVS before I've never really done (11:40 - 11:45)
IVs before like and then being able to (11:42 - 11:47)
get excited that they did it you know (11:45 - 11:49)
correctly or they went out and they (11:47 - 11:50)
bought the vitamins and they put it into (11:49 - 11:52)
the Pokemon and they're like oh my gosh (11:50 - 11:54)
it worked like I built a Pokemon and (11:52 - 11:55)
it's like cool it's like really cool (11:54 - 11:57)
that (11:55 - 11:59)
um people are slowly starting to (11:57 - 12:02)
understand how important (11:59 - 12:05)
those vitamins can be (12:02 - 12:07)
um or EV training in general or natures (12:05 - 12:09)
and stuff like that so it's nice because (12:07 - 12:10)
like (12:09 - 12:12)
again if you're just playing through the (12:10 - 12:14)
story and you're shiny hunting or you're (12:12 - 12:15)
just doing raids and sword and shield (12:14 - 12:16)
like (12:15 - 12:18)
you probably have never really had to (12:16 - 12:20)
worry about that (12:18 - 12:24)
um it was always so selective to (12:20 - 12:26)
people who want to do competitive (12:24 - 12:29)
yeah and they started doing in the DLC (12:26 - 12:31)
of sword and shield I remember it was (12:29 - 12:33)
when they really started dropping items (12:31 - 12:35)
that it's like if you're competitive (12:33 - 12:37)
this is great if you're not competitive (12:35 - 12:39)
you probably now have a bunch of (12:37 - 12:41)
what was it was it mints or vitamins (12:39 - 12:42)
there was a play it was like an island (12:41 - 12:44)
you could go to that always had a bunch (12:42 - 12:45)
of the mints and it was like if you're (12:44 - 12:47)
not competitive you're like what are all (12:45 - 12:48)
the I mean I have all these mints and (12:47 - 12:49)
stuff but I don't really have anything (12:48 - 12:51)
to do with them like that was kind of my (12:49 - 12:54)
situation you know so uh (12:51 - 12:56)
there could be somebody that didn't know (12:54 - 12:57)
what they did and they're like oh all my (12:56 - 13:00)
Pokemon to be sassy that sounds cool I (12:57 - 13:01)
did that as a kid or at least at some (13:00 - 13:03)
point when they first started being a (13:01 - 13:05)
thing I remember doing that (13:03 - 13:07)
it's like I would like a sassy Pikachu (13:05 - 13:09)
on a sassy Squirtle I want a sassy (13:07 - 13:12)
Bulbasaur yep (13:09 - 13:12)

intro oh that's cool so you get like the (14:17 - 14:22)
video intro yeah (14:19 - 14:23)
um (14:22 - 14:26)
again I don't (14:23 - 14:28)
I don't think this is going to come to (14:26 - 14:31)
America in any capacity would you two (14:28 - 14:34)
buy it if it was the American theme (14:31 - 14:36)
songs oh they made one because I would (14:34 - 14:39)
yeah 100 way of playing it I do not have (14:36 - 14:42)
anything in my house that can play a CD (14:39 - 14:43)
this is one of those things that I would (14:42 - 14:46)
start to look for look to buy a DVD (14:43 - 14:48)
player for or a CD player for because I (14:46 - 14:50)
love the openings I love the anime (14:48 - 14:54)
openings this is okay so (14:50 - 14:56)
it's been a while since I've like burned (14:54 - 15:00)
a CD or put like music on on a CD I've (14:56 - 15:03)
done this before but you (15:00 - 15:05)
songs (15:03 - 15:07)
this is eight (15:05 - 15:11)
eight or nine eight or nine um CDs but (15:07 - 15:13)
each one is gonna have like two I'm (15:11 - 15:15)
pretty sure you could fit them all on a (15:13 - 15:17)
single CD right like I think it's more (15:15 - 15:21)
than just those but yeah (15:17 - 15:24)
like I think a CD is like 55 minutes of (15:21 - 15:26)
music or something (15:24 - 15:28)
uh something like that but is it maybe (15:26 - 15:32)
is it that the intro and outro like (15:28 - 15:35)
stuff might be longer when it's not I (15:32 - 15:36)
have the track listing here yeah it (15:35 - 15:40)
looks like there are 17 12. (15:36 - 15:43)
there's 17 tracks on disc one (15:40 - 15:47)
yeah so like the alola soundtrack disc (15:43 - 15:50)
seven opens up with alola that must be (15:47 - 15:52)
the theme song and then it has a 20th (15:50 - 15:54)
Anniversary song (15:52 - 15:56)
miria's connection I don't know what (15:54 - 15:58)
that is there's midai (15:56 - 16:02)
that's kind of like me ride on (15:58 - 16:02)
um they have a song called bless and (16:02 - 16:05)
then they have like the ending theme (16:04 - 16:07)
they have a bunch of songs but yeah okay (16:05 - 16:10)
so there is more than just two songs (16:07 - 16:13)
this doesn't need nine discs so if it's (16:10 - 16:16)
just theme songs if disc seven is alola (16:13 - 16:18)
is every disc a different is every disc (16:16 - 16:20)
each region so this one I can't believe (16:18 - 16:22)
so yes because this is what it looks (16:20 - 16:24)
like this which would be like Jirachi (16:22 - 16:26)
and stuff (16:24 - 16:26)
drop your Hoenn though isn't it so (16:29 - 16:33)
wouldn't disc 4B oh right it gets a (16:30 - 16:36)
little mixed up near the beginning (16:33 - 16:38)
okay so it's just it's just a discs and (16:36 - 16:41)
they just put the tracks on as yeah disc (16:38 - 16:45)
five is the it it opens with v which I'm (16:41 - 16:47)
assuming is five (16:45 - 16:49)
sounds about right that's about right (16:47 - 16:52)
yeah the six opens up with XYZ which (16:49 - 16:53)
that makes sense because that would be (16:52 - 16:56)
callous yeah Kalos confirmed they're (16:53 - 17:00)
putting remade music on a disc there we (16:56 - 17:03)
go we finally got confirmation (17:00 - 17:06)
um yeah so uh that was like uh (17:03 - 17:08)
um I don't know if you noticed it when (17:06 - 17:10)
you were in Japan Bobby but like they (17:08 - 17:12)
had so many like fies or just like huge (17:10 - 17:15)
towering music stores Japan is like a (17:12 - 17:19)
very vertical uh country so you can walk (17:15 - 17:22)
in and like this floor is like K-pop but (17:19 - 17:24)
this floor is J-pop this floor is like (17:22 - 17:27)
American rock this floor is like r b and (17:24 - 17:29)
like you just you just keep going up or (17:27 - 17:30)
if it was like an anime store it'd be (17:29 - 17:33)
like this story is uh manga this this (17:30 - 17:36)
floor is like anime manga this floor is (17:33 - 17:40)
like graphic books this is like I they (17:36 - 17:42)
categorize as you go up yeah no there's (17:40 - 17:45)
definitely a lot of music stores record (17:42 - 17:46)
stores (17:45 - 17:48)
um I think there was like a Tower (17:46 - 17:50)
Records in Shibuya kind of close to (17:48 - 17:51)
where we stayed when we were in Tokyo (17:50 - 17:52)
but (17:51 - 17:54)
um yeah my wife like took me around to (17:52 - 17:56)
like the the stores where she would buy (17:54 - 17:57)
CDs when she was like living there as a (17:56 - 18:00)
teenager and stuff and uh it was all the (17:57 - 18:03)
same as it was like you know that time (18:00 - 18:06)
like 10 15 years ago so uh now they're (18:03 - 18:09)
big big on the discs big on the discs (18:06 - 18:12)
I I think it's I think it's funny that (18:09 - 18:14)
like Japan loves like the physical media (18:12 - 18:17)
so much but like they also have like the (18:14 - 18:19)
smallest apartments and houses in like (18:17 - 18:21)
the world you like think they would like (18:19 - 18:23)
lean into like the digital stuff to like (18:21 - 18:25)
save space but (18:23 - 18:27)
they figure it out hey speaking of Music (18:25 - 18:30)
we don't have the sword and shield music (18:27 - 18:32)
at all yet still (18:30 - 18:35)
yeah I don't think that's ever coming I (18:32 - 18:36)
think (18:35 - 18:39)
yeah maybe someday when I went for the (18:36 - 18:41)
30th anniversary (18:39 - 18:42)
[Laughter] (18:41 - 18:45)
when they remake sword and shield the (18:42 - 18:47)
tree texture will be better when I went (18:45 - 18:48)
to Japan that was like let's go Pikachu (18:47 - 18:50)
let's go Eevee and every Pokemon Center (18:48 - 18:51)
I went to (18:50 - 18:54)
uh they had like the CD collection of (18:51 - 18:57)
let's go Pikachu let's go Evie I kind of (18:54 - 18:58)
regret not buying it although I'm sure (18:57 - 19:00)
it's probably pretty easy to import off (18:58 - 19:02)
eBay or something but yeah I like looked (19:00 - 19:04)
at it and I was like ah this is cool but (19:02 - 19:07)
also like I don't own a CD player (19:04 - 19:08)
anymore like my PC doesn't even have (19:07 - 19:11)
like a CD slot (19:08 - 19:13)
yeah (19:11 - 19:14)
like you wouldn't just put it up in your (19:13 - 19:17)
background or something anyway yeah like (19:14 - 19:18)
I just bought a Pokemon record player (19:17 - 19:21)
yeah you have a giant box of cards (19:18 - 19:23)
that's sitting right behind your right (19:21 - 19:24)
side there and I'm sure it's still (19:23 - 19:26)
sealed you haven't opened it all or (19:24 - 19:28)
anything (19:26 - 19:28)
is it open yeah okay another the bad bad (19:28 - 19:33)
Bulls okay (19:32 - 19:35)
um (19:33 - 19:35)
what's next on our news list here (19:36 - 19:42)
getting sidetracked (19:39 - 19:44)
um actually I think that this is (19:42 - 19:45)
probably a good place to take a break (19:44 - 19:47)
because we have uh anime news to (19:45 - 19:50)
actually talk about and then uh we have (19:47 - 19:52)
Pokemon go so I think both of those will (19:50 - 19:54)
probably take more than 10 minutes each (19:52 - 19:57)
so we will take a quick break uh and (19:54 - 19:59)
then when we come back we will talk (19:57 - 20:00)
about (19:59 - 20:02)
um some anime stuff and some Pogo stuff (20:00 - 20:05)
and uh maybe like a quick Greninja recap (20:02 - 20:08)
since that is now long gone so we'll be (20:05 - 20:11)
right back and we are back from our (20:08 - 20:13)
break all right let's talk about the (20:11 - 20:16)
Pokemon anime because that's everyone (20:13 - 20:19)
loves that uh (20:16 - 20:19)
uh so uh this is off comicbook.com the (20:20 - 20:27)
new anime is planning to release on (20:25 - 20:30)
April 14th (20:27 - 20:31)
um and that will feature the two new (20:30 - 20:33)
people liko (20:31 - 20:35)
and Roy (20:33 - 20:37)
is that that's what that's (20:35 - 20:41)
that's close enough yeah I still think (20:37 - 20:42)
those are probably going to change for (20:41 - 20:45)
America oh yeah for sure yeah I don't I (20:42 - 20:47)
don't think those are gonna stick but I (20:45 - 20:49)
don't know who knows I mean Ash was (20:47 - 20:51)
different in Japanese too yeah it was (20:49 - 20:53)
Satoshi right yeah yeah (20:51 - 20:56)
uh so April 14th for that that'll be the (20:53 - 20:59)
Japanese anime we still don't have a U.S (20:56 - 21:01)
release date all the we don't actually (20:59 - 21:03)
know what would be any of the US I don't (21:01 - 21:05)
know if Netflix is going to pay for that (21:03 - 21:07)
or buy I don't know Paramount plus gonna (21:05 - 21:10)
step in and they're like we want Pokemon (21:07 - 21:13)

Pokemon on one service for a low low (21:16 - 21:22)
price of five dollars a month (21:19 - 21:22)
um the little I guess blurb I wanted to (21:24 - 21:30)
pull here from uh Serebii is it says (21:27 - 21:31)
this news will focus on a special (21:30 - 21:34)
pendant that is around liko uh who's the (21:31 - 21:37)
the female protagonist (21:34 - 21:39)
um questioning what it is for and states (21:37 - 21:42)
that uh liko is from paldea more (21:39 - 21:44)
information to come next week so two (21:42 - 21:47)
things there or three things I guess one (21:44 - 21:50)
is the pendant two is uh more (21:47 - 21:52)
information next week although we're (21:50 - 21:54)
recording our podcast early so you have (21:52 - 21:56)
to wait on that for us (21:54 - 21:58)
um I'm sure it's not breaking news we (21:56 - 22:00)
have until April uh and then the third (21:58 - 22:04)
is that she is from paldea (22:00 - 22:09)
which maybe nips a few of the ishy Ash's (22:04 - 22:12)
daughter in the butt I guess people (22:09 - 22:13)
could be like those people are gonna (22:12 - 22:15)
have to keep out there yeah (22:13 - 22:18)
people will always have explanations (22:15 - 22:21)
until we know (22:18 - 22:21)
um yeah that's like still a big ongoing (22:21 - 22:26)
thing of like are any of these (22:23 - 22:27)
characters related to Ash is Ash gonna (22:26 - 22:29)
be older (22:27 - 22:31)
um (22:29 - 22:33)
I there's there's a lot of theories out (22:31 - 22:35)
there just wait just wait until the (22:33 - 22:37)
English version comes out and her name's (22:35 - 22:38)
Ashley (22:37 - 22:40)

it's gonna be a lot of a lot going on (22:40 - 22:44)
then (22:42 - 22:46)
see it now (22:44 - 22:48)
um (22:46 - 22:50)
Bobby I don't think you were on when we (22:48 - 22:53)
talked about Ash leaving (22:50 - 22:56)
no also your do your kids watch the (22:53 - 22:59)
anime they do yeah they do (22:56 - 23:01)
um but it's very new (22:59 - 23:05)
to them so my kids are five and two and (23:01 - 23:07)
they just started we just started (23:05 - 23:10)
watching the anime (23:07 - 23:10)
um maybe like a month ago a month and a (23:10 - 23:14)
half ago and like it was actually we (23:12 - 23:15)
started watching the anime shortly (23:14 - 23:17)
before it was announced that like that (23:15 - 23:19)
Ash wasn't gonna be like the main (23:17 - 23:21)
character of the next one (23:19 - 23:23)
um but we've been watching like uh the (23:21 - 23:26)
Indigo like the the for the season one (23:23 - 23:28)
oh wow so it's not we haven't been (23:26 - 23:29)
watching the newer stuff we've been (23:28 - 23:31)
watching like the the older starting (23:29 - 23:33)
them off with the old stuff it was what (23:31 - 23:35)
was like on Netflix like it was rude (23:33 - 23:37)
Jesse and James before they realized (23:35 - 23:39)
they were comic relief characters yes (23:37 - 23:42)
yeah so uh yeah we were we've just been (23:39 - 23:43)
watching (23:42 - 23:46)
um that lately so not not too far into (23:43 - 23:48)
it but they do know like you know (23:46 - 23:49)
they're like oh Ash and Pikachu and (23:48 - 23:51)
things like that I'm like ah don't get (23:49 - 23:54)
too used to we're gonna skip forward to (23:51 - 23:56)
the new stuff but (23:54 - 23:57)
yeah I mean they'll have about the (23:56 - 23:59)
amount of time with those characters as (23:57 - 24:01)
any amount of characters have had on (23:59 - 24:03)
Yu-Gi-Oh shows or other shows that (24:01 - 24:05)
switch characters every season or two so (24:03 - 24:07)
right you're right I guess that's true I (24:05 - 24:08)
guess that's true I'm not really sure (24:07 - 24:09)
the plan though maybe we go through all (24:08 - 24:12)
25 of the previous years of anime with (24:09 - 24:15)
them so no actual human can actually do (24:12 - 24:18)
that at this point it's like what 1200 (24:15 - 24:20)
episodes or something yeah it's a lot (24:18 - 24:22)
it's a lot and a lot of them are bad (24:20 - 24:24)
like I have like 20 of the 1200 is is (24:22 - 24:27)
like some Pokemon race between like two (24:24 - 24:29)
water Pokemon (24:27 - 24:32)
15 of them are like how ugly fee bass is (24:29 - 24:35)
and and how they really want to evolve (24:32 - 24:39)
like they've definitely repeated some uh (24:35 - 24:41)
some tropes over and over over the years (24:39 - 24:43)
well we just we were just watching the (24:41 - 24:46)
one where the two Pokemon (24:43 - 24:51)
gyms in dark city dark town uh they're (24:46 - 24:53)
like gangs it's like a gang war (24:51 - 24:54)
happening between Pokemon trainers so (24:53 - 24:56)
all the people hate Pokemon trainers and (24:54 - 24:58)
into like Ash Misty and Brock show up (24:56 - 25:00)
and kids are throwing rocks at them and (24:58 - 25:02)
stuff because they hate Pokemon trainers (25:00 - 25:04)
in this town I don't know I don't know (25:02 - 25:06)
if you either remember this you did not (25:04 - 25:07)
remember that (25:06 - 25:10)
or the Electabuzz yes the alleged (25:07 - 25:11)
Electabuzz there's a cipher that are (25:10 - 25:13)
fighting each other I don't remember if (25:11 - 25:15)
rocks being threw up there's the part (25:13 - 25:17)
where and then Pikachu Thunder shocks (25:15 - 25:18)
these three little kids who fall off the (25:17 - 25:20)
roof and then Ash is like oh I'm so (25:18 - 25:21)
sorry your little kids but you were (25:20 - 25:24)
throwing rocks at us (25:21 - 25:24)
I don't remember this episode from when (25:27 - 25:32)
I was younger but it was intense well (25:29 - 25:34)
your your five-year-old plays go right (25:32 - 25:35)
yeah (25:34 - 25:39)
yep he does and actually my two-year-old (25:35 - 25:42)
always also started she's like throwing (25:39 - 25:44)
curveballs and stuff now and I was just (25:42 - 25:46)
like oh okay we're (25:44 - 25:48)
starting real young here so we're at (25:46 - 25:50)
this age (25:48 - 25:53)
um well speaking of curveballs uh let's (25:50 - 25:54)
talk about Pokemon go (25:53 - 25:56)
that was that was maybe the best (25:54 - 25:58)
transaction I had never been getting (25:56 - 26:01)
better fantastic (25:58 - 26:04)
um okay so at the Hoenn Las Vegas tour (26:01 - 26:06)
uh they're going to release a new (26:04 - 26:11)
feature I'm sure that won't break (26:06 - 26:11)
uh it's called (26:12 - 26:16)
it's a fairly simple one (26:14 - 26:18)
yeah (26:16 - 26:22)
do you think that would stop them (26:18 - 26:26)
uh catch Pokemon uh with location cards (26:22 - 26:30)
at the Pokemon go uh Hoenn tour Las (26:26 - 26:31)
Vegas (26:30 - 26:33)
um they say trainers were excited to (26:31 - 26:34)
announce a new feature that will make (26:33 - 26:36)
its first appearance at Pokemon go tour (26:34 - 26:39)
hoen Las Vegas location cards after (26:36 - 26:41)
catching a certain Pokemon from (26:39 - 26:43)
in-person raid battles at specific (26:41 - 26:47)
locations during the Hoenn tour (26:43 - 26:50)
trainers will have to a chance to (26:47 - 26:52)
receive a location card the souvenir (26:50 - 26:53)
background will appear on the Pokemon (26:52 - 26:55)
summary page showing where the Pokemon (26:53 - 26:57)
was caught (26:55 - 26:58)
um (26:57 - 27:00)
so those who participate in raids will (26:58 - 27:03)
have a chance of the location card (27:00 - 27:04)
doesn't say what the chance is if you're (27:03 - 27:07)
lucky trainers uh location cards are a (27:04 - 27:09)
new way for Traders to remember they (27:07 - 27:11)
caught a specific Pokemon (27:09 - 27:13)
and come around visiting a special event (27:11 - 27:15)
or location (27:13 - 27:18)
cards will be displayed well they'll (27:15 - 27:21)
display an image on the Pokemon summary (27:18 - 27:24)
page relate I think you know what's I (27:21 - 27:26)
think actually Pikmin already does this (27:24 - 27:28)
now that I'm thinking about this (27:26 - 27:30)
um location cards will rotate with the (27:28 - 27:31)
previous Pokemon summary in the (27:30 - 27:32)
background (27:31 - 27:35)
uh trainers can work together in Las (27:32 - 27:37)
Vegas to figure out which RAID battles (27:35 - 27:40)
will have the location cards (27:37 - 27:41)
um (27:40 - 27:43)
Please be aware of your surroundings (27:41 - 27:45)
thanks Niantic (27:43 - 27:47)
uh I think this can be I think this (27:45 - 27:49)
would this would be cool (27:47 - 27:52)
um if they will also if it comes over to (27:49 - 27:54)
the catch card (27:52 - 27:56)
you know the the because right now if I (27:54 - 27:57)
don't know if you've done the little cat (27:56 - 27:59)
where you where you like uh you can (27:57 - 28:01)
share the Pokemon you've caught and it (27:59 - 28:03)
it gives it like a little oh yeah (28:01 - 28:05)
summary and then it's got a little and (28:03 - 28:08)
the background is just a static image of (28:05 - 28:10)
like what the background of the summary (28:08 - 28:12)
usually looks like (28:10 - 28:13)
um and you can go and take your own (28:12 - 28:16)
picture and put that on the catch card (28:13 - 28:18)
but it's not great like it's not like uh (28:16 - 28:20)
how it's not like as good as like go (28:18 - 28:22)
snapshot or anything like that (28:20 - 28:24)
um but if they did that that would be (28:22 - 28:25)
kind of cool so that the background (28:24 - 28:26)
would then (28:25 - 28:28)
and if they don't it kind of makes the (28:26 - 28:30)
catch card useless for those Pokemon (28:28 - 28:33)
yeah so where where is the images going (28:30 - 28:35)
so I'm looking at Merrell right now in (28:33 - 28:37)
Pokemon go it's it says Merrell it has (28:35 - 28:39)
like the arc above its head it says (28:37 - 28:42)
cp-183 yeah power up it's going behind (28:39 - 28:44)
Merrell in the blue area where the blue (28:42 - 28:47)
is where the type usually is got it okay (28:44 - 28:49)
okay so that's what I that's what I (28:47 - 28:51)
thought and I was like okay I I hope it (28:49 - 28:52)
goes there because that would look (28:51 - 28:53)
cooler than scrolling to the bottom and (28:52 - 28:55)
it just being like Oh yeah oh with the (28:53 - 28:57)
bottom part yeah so but if you go into (28:55 - 28:59)
the little like uh menu and then click (28:57 - 29:01)
on catch card (28:59 - 29:04)
for that Maryland you catch card (29:01 - 29:05)
I don't think I've ever done this so (29:04 - 29:09)
it'll show you like a picture of okay I (29:05 - 29:10)
didn't know the catch card button was (29:09 - 29:12)
there okay then you got it (29:10 - 29:16)
so my hope is that that background would (29:12 - 29:18)
also apply to this catch card because (29:16 - 29:20)
people share this like in the slack and (29:18 - 29:21)
stuff when people get a shiny they've (29:20 - 29:23)
been sharing the catch card lately (29:21 - 29:24)
um I think more people more people are (29:23 - 29:26)
using this now so it'll be kind of cool (29:24 - 29:28)
if that background was also in the catch (29:26 - 29:30)
card I feel like you show the catch card (29:28 - 29:32)
when the IVs aren't great (29:30 - 29:35)
foreign (29:32 - 29:37)
and I also feel like if it does show in (29:35 - 29:39)
the catch card it's going to be broken (29:37 - 29:40)
and it's going to be cropped and it's (29:39 - 29:42)
not going to look great I could be wrong (29:40 - 29:45)
you know that is also true but we'll see (29:42 - 29:48)
maybe you could like switch on a traded (29:45 - 29:50)
Pokemon what happens oh I can't (29:48 - 29:52)
because if I click it there's no catch (29:50 - 29:54)
card for a traded photo that makes sense (29:52 - 29:56)
because I didn't catch it yeah it (29:54 - 29:57)
hatched as well I think doesn't have it (29:56 - 30:00)
and you have to have caught it in a raid (29:57 - 30:01)
or in the wild (30:00 - 30:04)
um okay that's interesting because one (30:01 - 30:06)
of the things I'm excited for about this (30:04 - 30:08)
new feature is that when you trade these (30:06 - 30:10)
Pokemon I'm hoping that the traded (30:08 - 30:11)
person will still be able to have the (30:10 - 30:13)
fancy background on them because that's (30:11 - 30:16)
a cool collectible thing yeah that would (30:13 - 30:18)
be cool too exactly even though okay (30:16 - 30:20)
okay so I have two thoughts one I I do (30:18 - 30:22)
think this is really cool (30:20 - 30:25)
um and I I but I can't help but think (30:22 - 30:28)
this is another way for Niantic to force (30:25 - 30:32)
an in-person experience (30:28 - 30:32)
um because I don't know if you I don't (30:32 - 30:36)
know if like (30:34 - 30:38)
I don't I don't know let's just say like (30:36 - 30:41)
the Space Needle is is one of these like (30:38 - 30:42)
cool locations right like we I think we (30:41 - 30:44)
could all are I think we could all agree (30:42 - 30:45)
that like (30:44 - 30:47)
monuments in the United States or all (30:45 - 30:48)
over the world Space Needle would be (30:47 - 30:50)
like okay that would that would have one (30:48 - 30:52)
maybe like Statue of Liberty whatever (30:50 - 30:55)
that giant Silver Gate thing in St Louis (30:52 - 30:56)
it's the one the good thing in St Louis (30:55 - 30:58)
and it ain't that good (30:56 - 31:00)
um like those would probably have catch (30:58 - 31:01)
cards (31:00 - 31:04)
and most of those are gyms so if you do (31:01 - 31:05)
a raid there you have a chance of (31:04 - 31:06)
getting like the Space Needle in the (31:05 - 31:08)
background which would be really cool (31:06 - 31:10)
but I wonder if they would be like oh (31:08 - 31:12)
you have to be in person to get the (31:10 - 31:14)
chance to do it (31:12 - 31:16)
I would have I would guess yes just (31:14 - 31:17)
because of the way that they're like (31:16 - 31:19)
talking about it even at the Hoenn tour (31:17 - 31:22)
yeah (31:19 - 31:25)
you know you have to be there which yeah (31:22 - 31:27)
I'm sure they'll do something so you (31:25 - 31:28)
can't remote right into those ones (31:27 - 31:29)
anyway if you're not actually there (31:28 - 31:31)
right like (31:29 - 31:34)
um but I'm sure I feel like there's not (31:31 - 31:36)
a whole lot of loss to that though if (31:34 - 31:37)
you're not in person like I feel like (31:36 - 31:40)
it's one of those in-person things where (31:37 - 31:42)
it's cool and it's fun if when it when (31:40 - 31:44)
it works and if it works I I think it (31:42 - 31:47)
will work but I'm kind of disappointed (31:44 - 31:48)
that it's only a chance at getting it (31:47 - 31:50)
yeah that's not gonna be every single (31:48 - 31:52)
Pokemon that you catch there because if (31:50 - 31:54)
you if you aren't able to find one if (31:52 - 31:57)
you're just super unlucky that's kind of (31:54 - 31:59)
miserable yeah yeah like if you wanted (31:57 - 32:01)
to catch (31:59 - 32:03)
if you wanted to get all of the location (32:01 - 32:05)
cards I don't know let's just say (32:03 - 32:06)
there's like five of them at the Hoenn (32:05 - 32:08)
tour and it's like well I keep doing it (32:06 - 32:10)
right at this one and I'm not getting it (32:08 - 32:13)
and now the day is over and I did five (32:10 - 32:16)
raids there and I feel like it might (32:13 - 32:18)
just be one for the city and have the (32:16 - 32:20)
city as the background that's been my my (32:18 - 32:23)
understanding but I also it would be (32:20 - 32:26)
really unfortunate if you got a hundred (32:23 - 32:28)
percent of one Pokemon and it didn't (32:26 - 32:30)
have the catch card on it and you got a (32:28 - 32:33)
really bad IV Pokemon of the same kind (32:30 - 32:35)
and it did have the catch card and that (32:33 - 32:36)
made you feel like you had to keep the (32:35 - 32:38)
bad Pokemon when otherwise you wouldn't (32:36 - 32:40)
right (32:38 - 32:42)
which is why yeah no I'm I'm kind of (32:40 - 32:43)
disappointed that it's not going to be (32:42 - 32:46)
on all of the Pokemon at the event yeah (32:43 - 32:48)
but it will be that thing where they put (32:46 - 32:51)
like Community Day in like the notes but (32:48 - 32:53)
you don't see that until you're well (32:51 - 32:54)
that's what you were just afraid it was (32:53 - 32:57)
gonna be yeah yeah that's what I was (32:54 - 32:59)
afraid it was going to be although I do (32:57 - 33:00)
like that too I'm not saying I don't (32:59 - 33:04)
like the yeah no I like it it's just not (33:00 - 33:06)
super (33:04 - 33:09)
special not super noticeable I mean it's (33:06 - 33:12)
no big Pokemon no no that that's that we (33:09 - 33:14)
haven't talked about that in the show (33:12 - 33:16)
it's a huge Pokemon and the tiny Pokemon (33:14 - 33:18)
yeah I think I think the like catch (33:16 - 33:22)
location thing is (33:18 - 33:25)
harmless enough where you don't feel (33:22 - 33:26)
like you're really missing out if you (33:25 - 33:29)
don't get it but if you are interested (33:26 - 33:31)
it's like a fun thing and I do think (33:29 - 33:32)
that is like similar to like the big (33:31 - 33:35)
Pokemon small Pokemon like I'm sure (33:32 - 33:36)
there are plenty of people I know there (33:35 - 33:38)
are plenty of people I I'm on the (33:36 - 33:40)
internet uh that are like I don't care (33:38 - 33:43)
about the big and small but like I love (33:40 - 33:46)
that feature I think it's great like I (33:43 - 33:48)
already have like I had no desire to (33:46 - 33:51)
ever click on like a slack off again (33:48 - 33:54)
right I I have like 40 shiny slack-offs (33:51 - 33:58)
I will never need uh to power up uh uh (33:54 - 34:01)
slacking I I've already evolved all that (33:58 - 34:02)
I need to evolve I just don't need any (34:01 - 34:04)
more slacking candy I don't need any (34:02 - 34:06)
shiny slack offs it's fine (34:04 - 34:09)
but I don't have a big slack off and (34:06 - 34:12)
that's what I want I want a big one (34:09 - 34:14)
I would I will say that there's a (34:12 - 34:17)
difference there and that the XXL and (34:14 - 34:19)
xxs that's super big and super tiny (34:17 - 34:21)
Pokemon have a medal that you can earn (34:19 - 34:23)
for them yeah that's true and I'm sure (34:21 - 34:25)
hoping they're not making a medal for (34:23 - 34:26)
these catch cards because I'm still (34:25 - 34:27)
someone who's never been to an in-person (34:26 - 34:29)
Pokemon go event like that that would (34:27 - 34:31)
have one of those backgrounds and I (34:29 - 34:33)
would never get one of those things (34:31 - 34:35)
yep or almost never (34:33 - 34:39)
that is true okay so um so Pikmin has (34:35 - 34:41)
ultimately catch cards I didn't think (34:39 - 34:43)
about this until we were recording so (34:41 - 34:46)
when you when you get like (34:43 - 34:48)
um this is really bad for for the audio (34:46 - 34:49)
listeners and I'm sorry (34:48 - 34:52)
um so I it says this is a blue Pikmin (34:49 - 34:54)
from Silver Lake that's what it says so (34:52 - 34:56)
usually where you find the seed of the (34:54 - 34:58)
Pikmin is where it says where it's from (34:56 - 35:02)
uh it was from a lake uh I discovered it (34:58 - 35:05)
on June 4th 2022 and then the flower (35:02 - 35:08)
type it is is is uh (35:05 - 35:11)
um uh a yellow flower whatever that (35:08 - 35:12)
whatever that means okay too bright for (35:11 - 35:15)
the video listeners (35:12 - 35:15)
they're like bright flower yeah too (35:16 - 35:20)
bright (35:18 - 35:24)
um okay got it and then I have a I read (35:20 - 35:26)
Pikmin that was discovered near the (35:24 - 35:28)
Heinz Convention Center I have no clue (35:26 - 35:30)
where that is um I think that might have (35:28 - 35:33)
been in Boston also a yellow flower (35:30 - 35:37)
um but because I took a picture that day (35:33 - 35:40)
um it attached the picture to it I did (35:37 - 35:42)
not do that it was just like it it knew (35:40 - 35:46)
that that this Pikmin was near this it (35:42 - 35:49)
looks like it's um yes it was in Boston (35:46 - 35:51)
it was like a card shop in Boston that I (35:49 - 35:53)
went to so it took my picture and it (35:51 - 35:56)
assigned it to (35:53 - 35:57)
that Pikmin (35:56 - 35:59)
which means that Pikmin is reading my (35:57 - 36:01)
camera roll I just realized yes I was (35:59 - 36:03)
gonna say did it did it take it did you (36:01 - 36:05)
take the picture in Pikmin or did you (36:03 - 36:07)
just happen I took the picture outside (36:05 - 36:10)
of Pikmin oh that's not interesting good (36:07 - 36:11)
yeah that could result in some (36:10 - 36:13)
interesting Pikmin (36:11 - 36:16)
wow just finding out some new stuff here (36:13 - 36:19)
on the podcast (36:16 - 36:19)
you know I think when Pikmin came out (36:20 - 36:25)
like a year and a half ago people were (36:23 - 36:26)
like oh Pikmin wants to read our camera (36:25 - 36:29)
roll and I was like Ah that's fine I (36:26 - 36:31)
take pictures of like Pokemon and cats (36:29 - 36:34)
and then I was like oh it's cool like (36:31 - 36:36)
this Pikmin has like a picture that but (36:34 - 36:38)
then when I thought about it more in (36:36 - 36:41)
depth of like oh I didn't tell it to (36:38 - 36:43)
look at that picture it it decided that (36:41 - 36:45)
that was good enough yeah you didn't (36:43 - 36:48)
remember where the Heinz Center was but (36:45 - 36:50)
Pikmin sure did just letting you know he (36:48 - 36:54)
knows exactly where it was sure did (36:50 - 36:55)
um (36:54 - 36:59)
anyways I was gonna go on and say (36:55 - 37:02)
I find it harder to throw those Pikmin (36:59 - 37:06)
away because the game randomly decided (37:02 - 37:09)
to attach a moment to it (37:06 - 37:10)
and like that that's a good moment right (37:09 - 37:13)
like that is like I was at Pax I was at (37:10 - 37:15)
a video game card shop it it didn't you (37:13 - 37:17)
have no idea what Niantic will do to you (37:15 - 37:20)
if you throw that Pikmin picture away (37:17 - 37:24)
so because they'll know (37:20 - 37:24)
maybe maybe social media maybe these (37:26 - 37:32)
games were were not meant to be kind of (37:29 - 37:35)
glad I never got Pikmin now yeah (37:32 - 37:37)
pikmin's out there in your camera roll (37:35 - 37:39)
uh going back to the big and small (37:37 - 37:41)
because we did not talk about this I (37:39 - 37:44)
absolutely adore the feature uh I I (37:41 - 37:47)
again I I do want to collect big and (37:44 - 37:48)
small Pokemon I think they're really fun (37:47 - 37:50)
I think it's really cool (37:48 - 37:51)
um (37:50 - 37:53)
to have like a bigger Pokemon next to (37:51 - 37:55)
you that's obvious and I like to look at (37:53 - 37:57)
like people's trainer things and it's (37:55 - 38:00)
like oh Bobby's walking with a Tyrantrum (37:57 - 38:01)
or something right like that's not true (38:00 - 38:04)
Bobby's always walking with a farfetch (38:01 - 38:05)
um neither of those things is true right (38:04 - 38:08)
now but sure we'll go with that but but (38:05 - 38:10)
if Bobby switched to a big farfetch I'd (38:08 - 38:12)
be like Ah that's tight Bobby has a big (38:10 - 38:14)
farfetched but then it goes like a level (38:12 - 38:16)
deeper for me because not only do I want (38:14 - 38:18)
to collect big and small Pokemon (38:16 - 38:19)
actually I don't actually care about (38:18 - 38:21)
small Pokemon I really just like the big (38:19 - 38:23)
Pokemon I like the small Pokemon small (38:21 - 38:25)
and Powerful (38:23 - 38:28)
like I think for me I like the big (38:25 - 38:30)
Pokemon because they're like distinctly (38:28 - 38:34)
bigger I would like I mean (38:30 - 38:37)
they're tiny yeah yeah I like the small (38:34 - 38:39)
Pokemon when they're already initially (38:37 - 38:42)
big Pokemon so I would like a small like (38:39 - 38:44)
Tyranitar because it's like taller than (38:42 - 38:46)
the Tyranitar now and I think that's (38:44 - 38:50)
cool right but now now I'm like on a (38:46 - 38:51)
mission for Community Days where it's (38:50 - 38:52)
like I think (38:51 - 38:55)
you know Pokemon go has been around for (38:52 - 38:56)
six years (38:55 - 38:58)
I just happen to make Pokemon content so (38:56 - 38:59)
it's like I get bombarded with the (38:58 - 39:00)
frequent questions of like how many (38:59 - 39:02)
shines you can commute day uh either (39:00 - 39:04)
like I didn't get enough or I got too (39:02 - 39:05)
many depending on if you live in a big (39:04 - 39:07)
city or you don't live in a big city (39:05 - 39:08)
right like I can be like ah you know (39:07 - 39:10)
every Community Day I get about like 12 (39:08 - 39:12)
or 14 Chinese and some people are like (39:10 - 39:13)
wow that's so many and some people are (39:12 - 39:16)
like only 12 I got 35 and it's like yeah (39:13 - 39:17)
cool like what are you gonna do with 35 (39:16 - 39:19)
studies that's fine like I I don't want (39:17 - 39:21)
to say like oh I got 12 and 14 to break (39:19 - 39:23)
it's just like I play for three hours I (39:21 - 39:26)
walk in a circle at a popular place I I (39:23 - 39:27)
catch everything I see like (39:26 - 39:30)
but for me now Community has turned to (39:27 - 39:33)
be more exciting because like I want a (39:30 - 39:35)
big or a small shiny (39:33 - 39:38)
and I think that's like a real like it (39:35 - 39:39)
makes it really hard on community day (39:38 - 39:41)
because you're not only even though the (39:39 - 39:43)
shiny odds are what like one in 25 (39:41 - 39:44)
Niantic will never tell us but that's (39:43 - 39:46)
what most people speculate they're 125. (39:44 - 39:50)
it's a I think it's like a one in 256 (39:46 - 39:52)
chance of it being big or small (39:50 - 39:56)
so one in 128 I guess technically if (39:52 - 39:58)
you're counting both sizes so now you (39:56 - 40:00)
have these two odds (39:58 - 40:02)
these two percentages or these two (40:00 - 40:05)
probabilities of getting either a big (40:02 - 40:08)
shiny or a small shiny and so that's all (40:05 - 40:10)
that's my new goal going forward with me (40:08 - 40:12)
days and I'm like I'm thrilled by it (40:10 - 40:14)
like I'm so excited to like I could get (40:12 - 40:16)
a big shiny and I like that's really (40:14 - 40:18)
exciting to me this is not surprising at (40:16 - 40:20)
all because you love the trying to go (40:18 - 40:23)
for the shiny with the mark you know in (40:20 - 40:25)
the in the main series I mean when you (40:23 - 40:28)
transfer the the super lit big and super (40:25 - 40:30)
small Pokemon into Pokemon home and into (40:28 - 40:33)
uh scarlet and violet they're gonna have (40:30 - 40:35)
the marks that's the cool thing about (40:33 - 40:36)
these yes is that was that confirmed (40:35 - 40:38)
that was I think so yeah (40:36 - 40:40)
I know Sarah B said something about that (40:38 - 40:42)
oh I didn't know this I'll have to look (40:40 - 40:44)
it up because I did get I I do have one (40:42 - 40:48)
bit B I have one big shiny and it's an (40:44 - 40:51)
Ursa Luna that I got on but I didn't (40:48 - 40:53)
know because my Pokeball club plus (40:51 - 40:55)
caught it so I never knew that it was (40:53 - 40:57)
big or small (40:55 - 40:59)
um and I evolved it because I was like I (40:57 - 41:00)
just got a Volvo shiny one to get the (40:59 - 41:03)
shiny deck Sentry and then when (41:00 - 41:04)
somebody was like oh you can search by (41:03 - 41:08)
either typing XXL or xxs in the search (41:04 - 41:10)
bar I was like oh my gosh I got like a (41:08 - 41:13)
big ursuluna and he's shiny (41:10 - 41:14)
um so now you're telling me that I can (41:13 - 41:16)
move that to scarlet and violet when (41:14 - 41:18)
obviously when Ursuline is allowed in (41:16 - 41:20)
the game I can get the mark next to it (41:18 - 41:21)
which is tied oh my God I think so (41:20 - 41:23)
there's I would I would check it with (41:21 - 41:26)
the non-shiny one first right right yes (41:23 - 41:30)
good call there's something with Legends (41:26 - 41:30)
so to do it so like you can move it to (41:30 - 41:36)
Legends now and there's also it's (41:34 - 41:38)
something with within Legends too that (41:36 - 41:39)
stays the same when it's a (41:38 - 41:43)
when it's an XXL uh Pokemon so do you (41:39 - 41:45)
think that people can finally today get (41:43 - 41:50)
a big weasel in Pokemon go and then move (41:45 - 41:53)
it to Legends (41:50 - 41:53)
[Laughter] (41:53 - 41:57)
makes it a little bit easier (41:55 - 41:59)
laughs (41:57 - 42:03)
one quizzle's spawning but I it's funny (41:59 - 42:04)
I'm actually in the same position as you (42:03 - 42:07)
though Steve uh I actually bought more (42:04 - 42:10)
storage space knowing that I'm going to (42:07 - 42:13)
be catching these XXL xxs Pokemon and (42:10 - 42:15)
not wanting to transfer them so I (42:13 - 42:17)
actually it got me to buy more storage (42:15 - 42:18)
space because I'm like oh I gotta have (42:17 - 42:20)
space for these I'm not gonna have to (42:18 - 42:21)
like try to pick and choose and I love (42:20 - 42:24)
that when you go through and mass (42:21 - 42:27)
transfer stuff it lets you know that (42:24 - 42:29)
you've selected oh it does big or tiny (42:27 - 42:30)
Pokemon and then you can leave them out (42:29 - 42:32)
of the mass transfer when you when you (42:30 - 42:34)
go into it's super helpful I did not (42:32 - 42:35)
know that yeah so it's like I don't have (42:34 - 42:38)
to worry about transferring one but I (42:35 - 42:39)
can go through and mass select (42:38 - 42:41)
everything and then just leave those (42:39 - 42:43)
ones out and transfer the rest (42:41 - 42:45)
so it's nice (42:43 - 42:45)
Hannah are you going to be on a journey (42:46 - 42:50)
to collect big and small Pokemon I have (42:47 - 42:52)
not decided yet how I feel about them I (42:50 - 42:54)
am keeping them for now (42:52 - 42:56)
I don't know how that's how it started (42:54 - 42:58)
looking forward that's that's how it (42:56 - 42:59)
started with me and then I thought you (42:58 - 43:00)
know what I'm just gonna buy some extra (42:59 - 43:02)
bag space and I don't have to think (43:00 - 43:05)
about this for weeks months you know (43:02 - 43:07)
sometime down the line just keep I mean (43:05 - 43:10)
I like to I like to keep my my Pokemon (43:07 - 43:13)
bag box my Pokemon box all cleaned out (43:10 - 43:15)
when I can and so I'm gonna do that soon (43:13 - 43:17)
while all the candy bonuses are going (43:15 - 43:20)
yes and I'm gonna have to figure out (43:17 - 43:21)
what I'm what I want to do with these (43:20 - 43:23)
Pokemon because (43:21 - 43:25)
I don't know how I feel about them (43:23 - 43:27)
they're not great IVs most of them yeah (43:25 - 43:30)
that's yeah I talked I just talked to (43:27 - 43:31)
Steve I was talking about this the other (43:30 - 43:33)
day uh it's like the candy bonus right (43:31 - 43:35)
now with the transferring rate that's (43:33 - 43:36)
going to be going on for another (43:35 - 43:38)
probably a day or so after when this (43:36 - 43:40)
podcast when the podcast goes up their (43:38 - 43:41)
shows will be like a full 24 hours left (43:40 - 43:46)
and I've got 1100 legendary Pokemon and (43:41 - 43:48)
I'm like I should probably just transfer (43:46 - 43:51)
a majority of these and get Triple candy (43:48 - 43:52)
right now like they're just sitting (43:51 - 43:54)
there chance you've had in a while I've (43:52 - 43:57)
got 33 other taboo Lele that like what (43:54 - 43:59)
am I gonna do with those 33 taboo Layla (43:57 - 44:00)
that aren't shiny think about this hobby (43:59 - 44:04)
think about this you could pay the money (44:00 - 44:08)
to activate the Pokey transporter more (44:04 - 44:10)
often instead of waiting for the six day (44:08 - 44:12)
cooldown period (44:10 - 44:15)
and move them to I've got 40 non-shiny (44:12 - 44:18)
Regice who needs 49 shiny Regice I don't (44:15 - 44:20)
want those cost it would cost more to (44:18 - 44:22)
transfer those Pokemon over than it cost (44:20 - 44:25)
to get them in the first place (44:22 - 44:25)
and it's not even though I have 53 (44:26 - 44:31)
non-shiny Heatran (44:28 - 44:31)
well what if you had 60 non-shiny (44:32 - 44:39)
Heatran then you could have 10 parties (44:35 - 44:40)
of six (44:39 - 44:43)
you could be a hitra and master (44:40 - 44:46)
good I could (44:43 - 44:49)
I don't know I I six years later I have (44:46 - 44:51)
not transferred um I have not thrown (44:49 - 44:54)
away a legendary Pokemon I have over a (44:51 - 44:55)
thousand (44:54 - 44:57)
in go right now but I've I've probably (44:55 - 45:00)
moved (44:57 - 45:02)
close to 50 meters into let's go Pikachu (45:00 - 45:04)
let's go Eevee because that was free (45:02 - 45:07)
technically and every six days I do try (45:04 - 45:11)
to move four to five Legends before the (45:07 - 45:14)
transporter is full (45:11 - 45:16)
um and then I remember that I gotta move (45:14 - 45:18)
these Legends over (45:16 - 45:20)
I can't I don't know there's something (45:18 - 45:22)
about like I know that I spent a dollar (45:20 - 45:23)
on it (45:22 - 45:26)
that I can't throw it away like it's (45:23 - 45:29)
like throwing the dollar away but it's I (45:26 - 45:32)
mean I also feel this I also I don't (45:29 - 45:34)
know why though because like the logical (45:32 - 45:36)
side of me is like this makes no sense (45:34 - 45:38)
like it's not doing anything more (45:36 - 45:41)
sitting in my storage they're never (45:38 - 45:43)
gonna get used like I'm never gonna move (45:41 - 45:45)
it to home I'll use it there possibly (45:43 - 45:48)
for what I guess I could trade him or (45:45 - 45:49)
something or like surprise trade people (45:48 - 45:51)
legendaries or whatever like yeah yeah (45:49 - 45:54)
things like that that's a that's a thing (45:51 - 45:56)
that's more rewarding than just (45:54 - 45:58)
transferring them for sure (45:56 - 46:00)
that's true that's that might be a thing (45:58 - 46:01)
too no you're gonna you're gonna get (46:00 - 46:04)
like that like 14 year old that's like (46:01 - 46:05)
super excited that they gotta Mewtwo (46:04 - 46:07)
through wonder trade and then they go (46:05 - 46:08)
check it and it has like the giant G (46:07 - 46:10)
symbol by it and they're like oh this is (46:08 - 46:14)
this is a girl YouTube even caught in (46:10 - 46:16)
Fire Red Leaf Green people don't like (46:14 - 46:20)
the little G symbol yeah whatever I'm (46:16 - 46:21)
okay with it I'm okay with it for now (46:20 - 46:23)
while I'm filling out the living Pokedex (46:21 - 46:26)
uh we'll deal with it you know figure (46:23 - 46:29)
out other things later but yeah (46:26 - 46:32)
all right last bit last bit of news here (46:29 - 46:34)
is just save save the dates for (46:32 - 46:35)

Niantic does this I think it's really (46:35 - 46:38)
great (46:37 - 46:40)
um giving people plenty of time to heads (46:38 - 46:43)
up uh not everyone has flexible jobs so (46:40 - 46:45)

following days (46:51 - 46:55)
uh or I don't know work a night shift (46:53 - 46:57)
because like what a Pokemon go event (46:55 - 47:00)
happens after six I think the only one I (46:57 - 47:02)
could think of was that Clefairy event (47:00 - 47:05)
yeah that was like the evening event (47:02 - 47:07)
well the neubat Community Day the post (47:05 - 47:10)

Saturday April 15th Saturday April 29th (47:29 - 47:35)
which will be a classic Community they (47:33 - 47:36)
have not said what that was that would (47:35 - 47:38)
be (47:36 - 47:39)
although (47:38 - 47:41)
have they done build them I feel like (47:39 - 47:42)
Beldum is probably pretty high up there (47:41 - 47:45)
on the list of Classics especially when (47:42 - 47:48)
we're running out of Megas and Mega (47:45 - 47:50)
Metagross is one of those meccas true (47:48 - 47:53)
that would be a good one uh Sunday May (47:50 - 47:55)
21st (47:53 - 47:59)
um so a lot of Saturdays a Sunday (47:55 - 48:00)
um so that there's your next three (47:59 - 48:02)
months of commune days (48:00 - 48:05)
and then there are additional in-game (48:02 - 48:08)
events so we have Sunday March 5th (48:05 - 48:12)
Saturday March 17th Sunday April 11th oh (48:08 - 48:16)
sorry what did I say 17th nothing on the (48:12 - 48:21)
17th confidently said that too clearly (48:16 - 48:21)
this is why we have show notes so people (48:22 - 48:27)
can see what I am also reading so they (48:25 - 48:28)
can correct me (48:27 - 48:33)
um March 11th uh Sunday April 9th Sunday (48:28 - 48:36)
April 23rd wow there's like so many (48:33 - 48:38)
events in April (48:36 - 48:42)
um and then Saturday May 27th to Sunday (48:38 - 48:46)
May 28th so that's a two-day event not a (48:42 - 48:48)
community day (48:46 - 48:50)
um I I (48:48 - 48:52)
don't know what that would be because (48:50 - 48:55)
usually like go go battle is usually (48:52 - 48:57)
just a day it's not a weekend yeah go (48:55 - 49:00)
battle days are huge (48:57 - 49:00)
users are usually day (49:00 - 49:03)
if there is any event that spans more (49:02 - 49:05)
than one day it's going to be closer to (49:03 - 49:08)
a week two day events or less common (49:05 - 49:10)
yeah I'm not (49:08 - 49:12)
I can't even think of the last two days (49:10 - 49:14)
I mean besides the EV Community Days (49:12 - 49:15)
that are at least two days right yeah (49:14 - 49:17)
like new ones but end of the year stuff (49:15 - 49:20)
Evie (49:17 - 49:21)
I don't know what else that would be (49:20 - 49:23)
another two days yeah I don't know I'm (49:21 - 49:26)
sure there's been one before but I can't (49:23 - 49:28)
think of I can't think of it (49:26 - 49:30)
yeah so what are we thinking for (49:28 - 49:32)
communities here they got technically (49:30 - 49:34)
Froakie and (49:32 - 49:36)
the Fennekin (49:34 - 49:39)
I think they could so I know a lot of (49:36 - 49:41)
people think Fennekin right just because (49:39 - 49:43)
Chespin was last month and so they're (49:41 - 49:46)
like patterns but uh they skipped a (49:43 - 49:49)
month with Snivy so Snivy it was Snivy (49:46 - 49:50)
and then it was two different Pokemon (49:49 - 49:53)
and then it was Tepig yes so I could see (49:50 - 49:56)
them doing that again just to draw that (49:53 - 50:00)
a little bit before Fennekin yeah (49:56 - 50:00)
I I don't know if they can get away with (50:00 - 50:04)
doing any gen 3 Pokemon because I (50:02 - 50:05)
thought they were gonna do gen 3 Pokemon (50:04 - 50:07)
before the Hoenn tour and then they were (50:05 - 50:08)
like Noibat and I was like because that (50:07 - 50:11)
was a thing leading up to the Johto tour (50:08 - 50:14)
of like we're gonna drip feed these (50:11 - 50:16)
Johto Pokemon that haven't been shiny (50:14 - 50:19)
that are now shiny so but they also they (50:16 - 50:22)
also did was it after Joe totor or was (50:19 - 50:24)
it Go Fest there was a Pokemon that was (50:22 - 50:26)
you know increased shiny chance at one (50:24 - 50:28)
of those events and then I feel like it (50:26 - 50:29)
was like soon after there was a (50:28 - 50:31)
community day or something with that (50:29 - 50:32)
Pokemon and people were not happy about (50:31 - 50:35)
it oh um because they were like we just (50:32 - 50:37)
had this like increased chance like at (50:35 - 50:39)
this other event and then you threw this (50:37 - 50:41)
into a it was Community Day or it was (50:39 - 50:42)
just an event where it was like they (50:41 - 50:45)
were really talking talking it up but (50:42 - 50:47)
um so yeah I don't know if they could do (50:45 - 50:47)
that again I don't know if they would (50:47 - 50:50)
give us a hoe in Pokemon in March that (50:47 - 50:51)
would be a (50:50 - 50:54)
a little bit too soon (50:51 - 50:56)
not saying they won't not saying they (50:54 - 50:59)
haven't but they shouldn't (50:56 - 51:02)
yeah I (50:59 - 51:02)
I'm not yeah I'm not sure what what they (51:02 - 51:08)
could do this year that isn't (51:05 - 51:11)
like already (51:08 - 51:11)
turned on (51:11 - 51:15)
or I mean there are still plenty of (51:13 - 51:17)
Pokemon right but they're yeah they (51:15 - 51:20)
could still do like a I mean they (51:17 - 51:21)
probably wouldn't do this but they could (51:20 - 51:24)
do like a vanillite line or yeah they (51:21 - 51:28)
could yeah they could also do umage they (51:24 - 51:30)
could introduce like a new Pokemon they (51:28 - 51:34)
might do Scyther at some point (51:30 - 51:35)
they could do site oh yeah because now (51:34 - 51:37)
they have they've got uh they've got (51:35 - 51:39)
clever they could like throw in there (51:37 - 51:41)
too oh I was like something's coming up (51:39 - 51:43)
something's coming up with Scyther at (51:41 - 51:45)
some point yeah yeah they could also do (51:43 - 51:46)
like a Whooper Community Day and then (51:45 - 51:49)
like introduce Cloud sire to like I (51:46 - 51:51)
would love that but I feel like it's way (51:49 - 51:55)
too soon yeah no I (51:51 - 51:55)
I don't think it's too soon because (51:55 - 52:01)
marketing is very powerful and if a go (51:57 - 52:03)
player hasn't played scarlet and violet (52:01 - 52:06)
then they don't realize maybe they some (52:03 - 52:09)
of them maybe don't realize the power (52:06 - 52:11)
that is Claude sire (52:09 - 52:14)
like they gotta wait until the patch (52:11 - 52:18)
though you're right they don't want the (52:14 - 52:19)
go players playing scarlet and violet (52:18 - 52:21)
yet yeah yeah (52:19 - 52:24)
[Laughter] (52:21 - 52:26)
um yeah I could see I could see them (52:24 - 52:29)
doing like a closet or another ursuluna (52:26 - 52:32)
thing so what is that like basculine or (52:29 - 52:35)
Cleaver or (52:32 - 52:36)
Stantler and a weird deer I don't think (52:35 - 52:41)
is as exciting but no they already did (52:36 - 52:42)
bravery and avalog technically yeah (52:41 - 52:46)
right yeah (52:42 - 52:47)
um I totally forgot to put this on the (52:46 - 52:49)
notes last bit of news here though real (52:47 - 52:50)
quick still Pokemon good news uh Pokemon (52:49 - 52:53)
go players won't have to purchase the (52:50 - 52:55)
Hoenn tour tickets for boosted shiny (52:53 - 52:56)
odds so (52:55 - 52:58)
um this event will happen the week so (52:56 - 53:01)
the global Hoenn tour will happen a week (52:58 - 53:04)
after the in-person one that will be (53:01 - 53:06)
Saturday (53:04 - 53:09)
February 25th and Sunday February 26th (53:06 - 53:13)
this is off uh Dex Dexter row (53:09 - 53:16)
Dexter troll Dexter what I don't know (53:13 - 53:18)
how to say that site dexarto or (53:16 - 53:20)
something yeah there we go (53:18 - 53:23)
that could be completely wrong so there (53:20 - 53:25)
is still the five dollar (53:23 - 53:27)
Masterworks research that you can buy (53:25 - 53:30)
but you don't have to buy that to (53:27 - 53:34)
participate in the Hoenn tour weekend (53:30 - 53:35)
um (53:34 - 53:37)
so the Masterwork it's for Shiny Jirachi (53:35 - 53:38)
so if you want to pay five dollars for (53:37 - 53:40)
Shiny Jirachi there's a bunch of other (53:38 - 53:41)
stuff to do we don't know what the we (53:40 - 53:43)
don't know what that is uh by the way (53:41 - 53:44)
like (53:43 - 53:45)
um you know if you're if you love Shiny (53:44 - 53:48)
Jirachi and it requires you to be level (53:45 - 53:50)
50 to get Chinese rachi and you're level (53:48 - 53:53)
25 to be a very long uphill battle to (53:50 - 53:55)
get to level 50. I don't think it will (53:53 - 53:58)
be level 50. but for the Mew you needed (53:55 - 54:00)
to be level 40. (53:58 - 54:01)
um which a lot of players complained (54:00 - 54:03)
about that like I'm not level 40 I can't (54:01 - 54:05)
get new yet so we don't know what that (54:03 - 54:06)
is (54:05 - 54:07)
um (54:06 - 54:09)
uh they're reporting though that the (54:07 - 54:12)
there will be boosted shiny odds and (54:09 - 54:14)
they they said they're saying that (54:12 - 54:17)
Niantic told them not everyone and not (54:14 - 54:18)
every Pokemon featured during the event (54:17 - 54:22)
will have boosted odds every spawn will (54:18 - 54:24)
have the chance to be shiny Niantic (54:22 - 54:26)
stated that the Boost is for select (54:24 - 54:28)
species and not all Pokemon will be (54:26 - 54:30)
boosted (54:28 - 54:31)
um we currently don't know which Pokemon (54:30 - 54:32)
will have boosted odds we don't know (54:31 - 54:34)
what the odds are (54:32 - 54:36)
Niantic will never tell us the odds some (54:34 - 54:38)
players expect the odds to be lower than (54:36 - 54:40)
Community which (54:38 - 54:43)
I I probably like comedian is one in 25 (54:40 - 54:47)
so lower as in like one in 100 maybe is (54:43 - 54:49)
I guess what they're assuming uh the (54:47 - 54:51)
event is free (54:49 - 54:54)
um and yeah so that's it not sure why (54:51 - 54:56)
Niantic didn't just come out and say (54:54 - 54:58)
this of like hey (54:56 - 55:00)
some Pokemon will have a better increase (54:58 - 55:03)
of shiny I I don't know why they waited (55:00 - 55:05)
so long I mean I guess they did say it (55:03 - 55:07)
they told uh this outlet and a couple (55:05 - 55:09)
other outlets I think uh Eurogamer had (55:07 - 55:11)
the same article (55:09 - 55:13)
I could see them not wanting to get too (55:11 - 55:16)
in the weeds with like shiny odds and (55:13 - 55:19)
that I know they do say like increased (55:16 - 55:21)
chance but that might be like as far as (55:19 - 55:23)
they or the Pokemon company really wants (55:21 - 55:26)
them to officially go with that you know (55:23 - 55:27)
they might not want to be (55:26 - 55:30)
getting too detailed like and some can (55:27 - 55:31)
be shiny and some will have increased (55:30 - 55:32)
odds and some will have more increased (55:31 - 55:34)
odds and you know like it so it might be (55:32 - 55:35)
easier to just let this go to the (55:34 - 55:37)
outlets and then (55:35 - 55:39)
have them explain it or have them kind (55:37 - 55:41)
of talk about it instead I sure hope (55:39 - 55:43)
this doesn't break and result in none of (55:41 - 55:45)
them able to be shiny oh it's real for (55:43 - 55:47)
Australia don't worry but it's but I (55:45 - 55:49)
mean at first it's at least only in in (55:47 - 55:52)
Vegas yeah that's true that's true (55:49 - 55:54)
that's true (55:52 - 55:57)
well I usually at an in-person go event (55:54 - 56:00)
almost everything has increased odds (55:57 - 56:04)
yeah being shiny except (56:00 - 56:08)
unknown has always had like the weird (56:04 - 56:10)
sometimes it's boosted sometimes it's (56:08 - 56:13)
not and then for the Johto tour I I (56:10 - 56:15)
think the part of the problem also is (56:13 - 56:17)
like for the Johto tour they're like (56:15 - 56:19)
things have increased odds but like (56:17 - 56:21)
corsola specifically didn't and you had (56:19 - 56:24)
to pay to raid for corsola (56:21 - 56:28)
um and I guess if I knew after the fact (56:24 - 56:30)
that corsola wasn't increased I probably (56:28 - 56:33)
wouldn't have done as many raids but (56:30 - 56:33)
you didn't know yeah then you can't feel (56:34 - 56:39)
well I mean you can't feel bad in the (56:37 - 56:41)
moment you can definitely feel bad after (56:39 - 56:42)
you spent the money (56:41 - 56:44)
you can definitely feel bad as you're (56:42 - 56:47)
sending them the lawsuit for uh (56:44 - 56:49)
whatever they're doing (56:47 - 56:53)
yeah I don't um well I think the (56:49 - 56:54)
I don't know how they're gonna do the (56:53 - 56:56)
worldwide stuff for torkel (56:54 - 57:00)
Tropius and relicanth but I think for (56:56 - 57:02)
the whole I think for Vegas they're only (57:00 - 57:05)
in 10ks (57:02 - 57:05)
they're not even in they're not in the (57:05 - 57:09)
wild or anything I don't think so I (57:07 - 57:11)
think they're only 10ks or raids I guess (57:09 - 57:13)
that sounds right I haven't been paying (57:11 - 57:15)
super close attention because I cannot (57:13 - 57:16)
attend (57:15 - 57:18)
the same but for those who can attend (57:16 - 57:21)
you all have special research for this (57:18 - 57:23)
next week leading up to the event I'm (57:21 - 57:25)
pretty sure yes yes I did my I did my (57:23 - 57:27)
first special research it gave me a (57:25 - 57:31)
Trico and I was like this is (57:27 - 57:31)
I gotta hype it up they're getting there (57:31 - 57:38)
yeah I bet the next day will be Mudkip (57:33 - 57:40)
and then I bet after that will be (57:38 - 57:43)
Torchic not gonna not gonna bet against (57:40 - 57:46)
that yeah I would (57:43 - 57:48)
um okay uh well a little bit of shorter (57:46 - 57:50)
show for you guys this week just because (57:48 - 57:52)

know what those fountains are called (58:07 - 58:09)
