Oh what's up everyone welcome to the 220 second episode of the Pokemon podcast 222 can we talk about throwing up for a second no preferably not all right people have a bad reaction to the concept why no that's why it is a topic of discussion because it can you know you know why it's a topic of despair iya 7e i can tell you why it's a topic of discussion because you said that the episode of seinfeld with the black-and-white cookie was not the episode of the seinfeld where he was bragging at how he hadn't thrown up in like seven years and i was like no that is the episode yeah a little it up on Wikipedia and prove you wrong that is the avoidance your happening right now hold on let's get this to go you're like we're gonna start the show and I'm like okay I know how that goes I know how starting the show goes I have no idea what is happening right now what's up everybody they see not me I have no idea how to do this anyway all right good good I'm glad we're all here I'm your host spj I have will anderson with us I do not eat the black and white cookie I eat no cookie too many carbs we'll get to that we also have Travis with us so i had i'm wearing these new headphones because my last ones fizzled out at me while i was at work and I just went to the the nearest corner store to buy some more because I wanted to listen to things i do and i ended up buying the only kind they had which were the i prefer the ones that just sit comfortably in your ears and they're just like your little your friends I don't like the ones that are invasive about it that like you're supposed to stick into your ear because now I'm very a we aware of the ear canal situation and like what my ear what the structure of that is and it's weird to me that each one feels different and I don't know how worried about that I should be I'm very confused right now good no understand her I think he was just making an allegory to the brexit I have no clue lies I understand the jam astic situation that you are in with the ear pods there because there's the ones that the traditional like apple style that are there just a circle that's the speaker it forms most of the surface of the headphone sits in there and it floats and it plays your tunes and then there's the ones I'm wearing right now which are lift craft Ian in that they are a range tentacle that's invading my ear canal they have they come with different sized cushions bubbles these can swap out depending on your ear size i guess and either they are too far out and they fall at the slightest gust of wind or they're too far in and I I just become intimately familiar with but your canal so your problem is that you don't have over the ear or on your headphones which are superior to the ear pod flash tentacle posh situation yeah and Steve just to clear things up the GM situation is between your toes it's the wax situation in your ears stop all right okay we also have Kippy here which I think we introduced last time as Tyler but known as Kippy the boss in slack so that's what i normally reference by how are you doing ma'am i'm rather confused but I think that's just my ability alright are you are your ears okay are they well when we get to our break i'll be switching me a headphones because the one side of them just fizzled out but i can continue on for now i'm glad that you and Travis have a relatable issue let's get back to throwing up why so if you're listening to this right now have you ever just SAT there after lunch and gone I think this is coming back up no cuz that yes good good cuz that's what that's what I that's what I feel right now we can detour real quick because we're we're nowhere near the topic of Pokemon but you are right well as in the episode of the black and white cookie from Seinfeld that that is the episode where Jerry talks about not throwing up for seven years and then he buys the black and white cookie and explains to Elaine that if everyone just looked to the cookie that would solve all the racial problems in the world and then he eats the cookie and then throws up later which is a metaphor of saying that the racial problems can't even be solved by the cookie because he grew up the cookie that is deeper than I had taken it I thought he threw up because he neglected you know people of Latin descent who aren't so firmly black or white hmm well the cookie is is clearly stating that black and white people can get together and then he eats the cookie but then he throws up mean yes it's it getting back to throwing up i took some stomach medicine but I got home and I feel like everyone remembers the like the last time they threw up like that at least to me that is a very vivid memory and mine was about two years ago very early in the morning Irene was leaving for the weekend and as she was getting ready I was just sitting near the toilet which became my like spot for the rest of the day Wow I remember this vividly and so now I am cautiously aware of making sure that going into this weekend that i am sitting on my couch and not my toilet hi this is travis speaking this is the Travis's voice you're listening to just here to remind you that this is a pokemon podcast just want to check in here and say I too am very confused as to why this is the topic of discussion usually off topic stuff at the beginning of the show is light banter about video games or something dubreq Cena meet ya let light things like video games or the brexit that joke is date will prob actually that's probably a pretty relevant historical thing that will be impactful for a long time however I'm just here to say we're in this together well we'll figure it out you and me listening this is not D&D Travis you can't just say that I can and I rolled the 20 so you know you you should have started that as not as my character right now but I cat sacred flame look which stomach medicine did you take as the only adult here which stomach medicine did you take I don't know what it's called it's knew it was new on the market it's like this it's this new thing called Tom's wait was it pink it was pink it was not Tom's it may might have been called nausea but it was a measurement is not called that I let me call like nauseate or something later yeah yeah yeah yeah it could be it could be it was a pink tablet you had to chew it they tasted like a sweetheart except more stale yeah yeah it's just got some variation on a bismuth how many did you take I took two I took what at first because I was I was wary of the taste and then after I had it I was like oh this isn't bad i'll have another one that's the kinda makes your tongue black right I don't think I hope not so ya know well bismuth makes something black but it's not your tongue oh yeah there's this thing you'll be feeling you'll be seeing that in a little while Steve if you're not having sort of a multi symptom gastrointestinal distress and it is really just like you feel that queasy I'm losing control I would I would say that my stomach doesn't hurt it's almost like a lingering in the back of the throat all right we don't have to get into too much detail but you've got kind of like that nervous feeling that something bad is eminent yeah we're all right now the nervous feeling is I don't want to throw up but I meant like a physical nervous feeling not a mental emotional one I'm just saying that there is a solution out there which I cannot recommend the name but it is lemon flavored and if you look in the stomach remedy section you'll you'll see it it comes in a green bottle and it kind of has a pastel rainbow on it go for that no because it's like within 15 minutes any kind of tickly stomach it goes away another option is to bite into some fresh ginger but that's not as easily obtainable that most people yeah doesn't sound appealing at all it's not meant to be appealing it's meant to make you feel better speaking of feeling better Travis how's your weekend with week uh fine good yeah great stomach doing fine yeah I'm okay i am getting on a flight tomorrow so uh checking tomorrow we might have a different story on our hands but i'm ok i'm good i didn't do anything in particular you've told week you've told me behind the scenes we put put it out there that you get motion sickness car sickness boat sickness i can't remember if I am in a thing and it's moving and it's moving faster than human legs are designed to take a person you can you bet your bottom dollar that I will be queasy if I driving that's fine because I am in control of the situation but pretty much all the time if a thing is moving in I a minute I will feel nauseous that's something I don't know if I could live like that I would sing the spongebob indoor song but I don't know it Kippy how you doing it's been what two months since last time you Ron approximately um what's new with you what's new I you I think you you were very excited about super mystery dungeon if i'm not mistaken oh yeah I unfortunately have not gone back to it in quite a while but it is such a good game um more recently I'm getting ready for the mystery dungeon to get on the Wii U which is going to be great I went to regionals a couple weeks back play 60 first overall which was pretty nice nice which regionals did you go to Utah regionals cuz I just have to make a 20 minute drive and then band there I am ice nuttin else playing a lot more Xenoblade are you done with school for the semester uh yeah have quite a while our schools a summer schedule is quite weird we have a lot of camps going on but I won't be able to make any of them because I'm getting a job pretty recently Congrats what kind of a job I'm planning for some cashier at a that's close by mmm so you're gonna work in a grocery store no way it would have been like the best full circle conversation if you said like you were going to work at an amusement park cleaning up people's pues ya I'm gonna work at a bakery baking exclusively black and white cookies I just want to apologize to travis's significant other that they will not be able to listen to this yeah she's gonna give this one a hard pass cuz she is a phobia of vomit oh that's hot this one is funny if you would only just tell her our trap is to look to the cookie and everything will be okay or or just skip this one we talked about zangoose at the end I'm gonna be the pokemon of the week I mean now you know everything you need well well tied tied that tie us down here so we get into the pokemon stuff what's what's new ah well I did that 10k on Saturday did real real bad was upset about that then I ran so 10k is 6.2 miles somehow my phone seemed to indicate that Iran 6.8 miles I don't know how that happened but then on Sunday I ran over eight miles and I was real happy because my speeds were actually better than i did in the 10k and then i went to work on monday and that was the usual and here we are that's that's it now it's Friday night right I'm night yeah this is a second time recording Friday night s Travis said earlier he is going out of town up to the frozen north of canada to visit the aforementioned girlfriend do you have wait wait do you have a passport yeah clearly you where mine is because I'd lost mine a long time ago and I just have no idea so you're a thought process here is if I know it's could be friends and maybe mine is hanging out with yours you've been to my house so my passport well I know you could I talk real you're picked up my passport and walked out don't jumped out of glove window which was happening that your own let me have a think that that was that a thing that was relevant during any Pokemon podcast episodes or is that only relevant during dungeons and dragon i'ts I think there was an episode with just will and myself we talk about love window I want to ask the important question here is it's it's late June i'm assuming canada still covered in snow correct good that is incorrect although i do have the weather forecast up if you want to for uh for Winnipeg if you want me that yeah let's let's let our listeners in Winnipeg know the weather two days after it already happened they are one listener gonna peg is skipping this episode haha now i would i look at look at the stats we have listeners in canada so Carly kindly changed it to Fahrenheit so I would know where any of these numbers mean so it actually won't really mean anything to Canadian listeners would say that when I say that Saturday will have looks like there's a symbol with a cloud with lightning come off coming off it so it's not a great sign with a high of 75 low of 59 on Sunday living to a is there rain there no I think at that no you get a chance of rain showers a high of 64 low of 50 then we get into the early bit of the work week we're getting a little better temperatures there 7277 and eighty one of the highest for monday tuesday and wednesday when you're riding up on Canada Day which i think is fried day you're gonna be nice clear skies high of 82 low of 59 great for those fireworks might want to take a sweatshirt with you when it gets a little chillier at the end of the night we're sending that right to NBC they won't take me did you hear how many times I stumbled to drink hey you know practice makes perfect adds personality yes being speaking of stumbling let's stumble through some news here we gotta get quite a bit of news our first bit of news is there are some new new Nintendo 3ds is coming out for Europe specifically there is a soul Gallio and luna la limited edition 3ds coming out it's going to be a black 3d s so gay Leo and luan a limited edition launches in Europe this November I don't know if that's coming anywhere else but there's also a yellow Pikachu 3ds new Nintendo 3ds coming out these are both listed as ll so I don't think they are I don't think they are coming to America but if they were I'd probably get the Pikachu one because what does ll signify it's the eds XL it's what Japan uses to signify that it is the larger 3d of it the yellow one is pretty awesome but the black one which is with with just so gay leo and luna luna la wow I am just stumbling on words here not as great NBC is never gonna hire you know I and II I dropped the ball for NBC I'm sorry guys are you guys do for a eyes it is everyone here running new 3ds Azure you guys still with the old 3ds I'm on the new 3dsxl I have the monster hundred one well what about you I have the new 3ds XL do you have a special edition or no I know I just got the plain black would you upgrade to a Pokemon one not with the state of my economy right now alright man Britain just left the EU I barely got two cents to rub together come on that 3d a spy in money troubles you know and skid row when you want opinions on the what's going to happen after the brexit really want to come to a bunch of Americans on a pokemon fire I'm willing we're the ones who really know what's going on I'm the only one here with a retirement account that is now empty hey I got a somewhat of a retirement account yeah speak for yourself because Travis use you on that old hardware you on the new one I never buy the upgrades when they come out I had just by the launch version I was still on the only reason I had a DS lite was because i was using my dads i'm technically my d s was always the d/s fat the silver launch one and ever buy any of the upgrade so I'm just on the normal 3d s nothing would Cano Pokemon 3ds would know vanilla seconds videos pokemon then convince I want okay if you if what would convince me to buy if they bundled it with the next generation of handheld console and it was and it was the same price and like a year earlier yeah I'd probably pick that way but but barring that I doubt I would ever buy any special edition 3ds unless it said unless had a picture of my face on it and said hey Trev this one's for you I'd buy that like I would consider that I would there would still be at the back of my mind maybe this is a waste of money Kippy are you on old hardware new hardware I'm on a two dias oh here on a 2d s i like i like the shoulder buttons on that yes it's very comfortable and a lot more durable than the three dias and also a lot more cheap i got mine for eighty nine dollars less can't go wrong with that moving on here we have a shiny Machamp i'm gonna combine both these both these articles here mark McQuillan i'm not too sure who that is besides they won that they won at the 2015 World Championships I don't I don't recall hearing that name though they our pokemon is going to distribute their Machamp tiny machamp use that the championships Machamp can be obtained in XY Omega Ruby or alpha sapphire Machamp was used in the 2015 championships it has the ability the ability no guard it knows dynamic punch Stone Edge wide guard and knock off this was distributed before in the past at UK France and Germany it will be here it says it okay here we go i pulled it up the 2016 at US national championships will be held between july first to july third at the Greater Columbus Convention Center in columbus ohio you'll be able to pick up your shiny Machamp there if you are attending it will it will be it will be in a cherish ball if the ball choice mattered well i'll show you don't have a choice but now you know tiny Machamp in a sheriff ball parish ball shiny machamp is amazing is it green I think it's green I think it's the ugly green color ah the eye I'm pokémons website though it does say that for the u.s. national championship it's only listing Omega Ruby alpha sapphire so I don't know if that's thing that the x y or x and y copy won't work because the bubble pd article said that it will so if you're in the US I would only bank on Omega Ruby alpha sapphire I don't get what the limitations are besides just saying hey make sure you have the newest game not like there's hardware limitations to distributing a 20 year old pokemon i just looked up the shiny Machamp and it is actually a very good emerald green instead of like the ugly green i ugly just like a new green I'm all right I would say that that's an ugly green I'm feel like it to describe it as emerald it would have to be a little deeper of a green darker I'm pulling it off of google images a might just be on one going straight to the source I'm going straight to bulbapedia there as is that the source that is the summer said the joke that the source of rampant ads recently maybe that's a hot take from someone who's hosted it shows with guests who are important members of bulbapedia I'm a hot take Steve I love olive Oh media I think they did tweet though recently that they were having an ad problem got it though I'm just putting that out there yeah it is actually discussing green next bit of news here in collaboration with cd-media Nintendo will become will begin operating in Greece and the belkin region balkan balkan on october first 2016 cd-media and nintendo will collaborate for future software titles and platforms nintendo halted its operations in Greece on december 31st 2015 after a local distributed distributor nortek Multi multi media SI and nintendo ended their relationship due to Greeks economical problems wow this whole episode is either you know what any that's high to the prek sick too because that's why is either brexit or greg zip that's why the UK wants to leave the EU is because Greece is dragging everybody down well intriguer s Greece's economy is about to get a lot better cuz they're getting pokemon stuff once again I liked over the October first the official website for nortek media SI is no longer alive the balkan region includes Greece Bulgaria cyprus Albania maket mesa macedonia romain i love reading list like this Croton ESO evaluation croatia bonds Anya Herzl gávea Bosnia herzig omnia montine it Monta I grow actually believe it's hers ago veena but whatever Montenegro and Serbia I said that one right and strangely enough I was just complaining earlier today that the college course i had that was required to take called map of the modern world served me no good in life and yet it just came in clutch mmm because those countries only began existing my first year of college you put you put episode 2 22 on your resume you tell them to skip the first 14 minutes of vomit talk yeah and you get right right doing that's just generally good advice for anyone here's the ultimate question Steve Travis and Kippy the all of those countries sidari like Greece and Albania and Bulgaria what country were they formerly the their part of the Soviet Union incorrect turkey they were not that were they a satellite state yes they were what would it have been wait what's the list again can we give somebody else a chance I weren't they all weren't they all Romania and then Romania broke up and got smaller incorrect well Czechoslovakia would have been involved somehow he was friends go to know now I'm not saying like the check and because I don't think he just said check love Republic or slovak republic I didn't as a country called Yugoslavia huh Yugoslavia so I don't look really dumb uh uh uh uh oh we're here to well needs his moments for his resume thank you I guess the more I got hey I'm ignorant welcome to this podcast welcome to Hawaii I don't know about wait what wait what was what was the country will Yugoslavia I don't know about Yugoslavia but in both Europe and Russia they are getting Pokemon Sun and Moon steelbooks special editions of Pokemon special editions of Pokemon Sun and Moon are called fan editions and will be released in both Europe and Russia the fan editions will be released on the same day Pokemon Sun and Moon will come out which is November 23rd for them there's wanted one fan edition for each game the fan edition includes that copy of the game and a steelbook the steal books have an image of the games cover without any logos or classification labels on the outside and then also has a map of the Aloha region on the inside that's the only difference now there is no price listed no process because we can't buy them anyways yeah it would be us just guessing at whatever British or European pounds turns into I don't even know what their currency is called I think now and nobody knows right now is collapsing this will be this serve as an ancient artifact of the euro you know I have the best intentions when we started this facyson hahahaha this is just a discussion between friends what is the oh how am I forgetting the word / raid well this is just a parade of ignorance about anything that happens on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean or honestly a Pacific Ocean to look you know how Americans are stereotypically people who know nothing about what happens outside of their country it's true did you listen to this hey I think I'm doing particularly well today you're doing fine I want to remind everyone to just look to the cookie I want to remind every well this turned out on the walkie public schools I went to MPs oh my level of everything outside of Wisconsin is very minimum in anything whether that's location time currency anything now for Kippy I hope he's good at math this is where he like grabs his collar with one finger he's like oh um depends on the math basic algebra I can do that maybe the arts what art oh I'm one of them big pick something yeah take your pick and what use I don't all right are you a music Ian I am yes I do a lot of musician based things Gillian is trying to convince you that it plays an instrument I think a lot of music like me I think that this is a good time for a musical break so that's what we're going to take you in town I your host q ma'am there's anything that can save this episode as hopefully my transitions so we will be right back you and we are back from our break there was a bit of news i forgot i was i was unsure of the dates i just pulled it up here this past Thursday three

favorite mystery dungeon pokemon mystery dungeon to the explorers of time as the one I had I didn't get the third version explorers of sky okay I heard it's great to I've at it is i've been told explores the skies the best it probably is if it's as good or better than explores of time and darkness than it would be i'm more of an original cannabis guy i really like the original mystery dungeons but yeah exports of sky is very very amazing really good story in those games I i posted to twitter earlier this week saying if anyone would be interested i streamed it because i haven't played the only mystery dungeon i've played was gates to infinity which didn't hold my attention that long but i did see that explored explores of the sky has the personality quiz we see do it otherwise i love this otherwise i had a blue rescue team and red rescue team do as well do they I just heard I heard explores was the best I want to start with the best because I don't want I don't want I want the best first to make sure that I can you know keep playing I don't want mediocre well here's a little inside secret that people have never learned and we'll finally know now the where I set my computer for where we record every week at week after week is on top of a copy of the prima official guide from nintendo power for pokemon mystery dungeon blue rescue team red rescue team on page eight it gives you all of the answers to the personality quiz to let you know what pokemon you will turn out as depending on what you answer I don't want to know though I want it to be a surprise all then don't look at the got wow it has all like profile look there's Mudkip of like it if you turn out what like if you turned out to be a Pokemon that whatever pokemon it is it's like what to expect and all your strengths and weaknesses and has all the secrets of the mystery the sinister woods and the silent chasm I have never actually opened this book even though I've had it for 10 years I don't I don't want to know I don't wanna be spoiled sounds well cool though just I just know that I have the official guys okay good we're playing and need help i can look something up for you good I took the personality quick quiz and I did get Mudkip just so y'all know which is amazing that's that's very reassuring if any if anything is right in the world it is that you got much I got me out which i think is really fitting that's awesome too yeah I remember I remember I was about was a bit shocked that you were a me off fan because I feel like those those are far and few between um yeah is great and it should feel great about it being great about its being great I'm sorry sorry everyone let's do a couple of pronoun case on my part we're all stumbling over to our own words today yeah let's uh let's do a couple emails here on my part if you have an email if you want to write in you can do so at SBJ at pkmn casscom or you can go to Pokemon podcast.com hit that contact button fill out that form it will to the same place first email is from Jay writes and says here's a question for the show maybe more of a topic but you all should talk about shiny pokemon you'd really like to get I'd like a legit shiny manaphy because it's hard to get thank you guys keep it up yeah now I gotta see and remember what should my favorite Pokemon actually have good Chinese well I'm actually currently in the process of breeding a shiny so that's the one I would really like to get because I would like to stop having to open eggs for that particular shiny but that's gonna be a giveaway so the shiny pokemon i would like for myself I was gonna say Rotom but it's not as Chinese not that special yeah I'm not I'm not too big on Chinese just because there I feel like they're not special at all you can just are in g1 you can just but you don't do that you can't imagine you can and that destroys the rarity of them I'm gonna go a slurpuff shiny orange eeing is for other people when you actually go through the process and get it yourself that is your own sense of accomplishment it's so wonderful it really is I mean I am I I think what I would be excited for us to finally find my first shiny in the wild and I feel like I was very I was very very big on shinies until I went to like he win him before i went to a u.s. national pokémon turner worlds where every single competitor is disillusioned back in 2011 where every single competitor is using a full shiny team and to me that took a lot of this the specialness away but I think weird all of the shinies have 31 IVs down the line yeah that is so must have put in a lot of time but yeah I I'm just looking forward to my first shiny that I come naturally in the wild um did you not tip anybody in x and y yes i did because the rumor was if you did like tip highly that there'd be more of an opportunity for you to encounter a shiny and i encountered all kinds of wild chinese and x and y at my my playthrough through x and y cuz i was doing some pokemon bank stuff earlier last week and i put about 85 hours next and why so that's it that's it i'm not i'm not sitting there doing things I don't enjoy I don't enjoy driving a bike in a circle hatching eggs no you're thank you I don't enjoy farming some berries nope no thank you double Braun yeah you're wrong on all counts I think shiny volcarona looks beautiful shiny slurpuff is is my answer the question cuz it looks really red and any tasty volcarona i don't like my absolute all-time favorite pokemon volcarona is yeah like when i get my tattoo sleeve of pokemon it's probably gonna be all fire types just because it seems like all of my favorites 10 intend to be in the fire type range would you invest de Mille our Vesta Oh breaking out the bad puns already good you're pretty far into the show I would say something thank you all good diving I just say something intelligent about lar Vesta and volcarona and interesting things about their evolutionary patterns but I don't want it to be wasted on this program let's come back to volcarona some other day yikes yeah that's true this is this a bettin Kippy did you say what what shiny that you you would really like I want a shiny breloom breloom and gets this really nice solid red color when it's shiny um I would go for a shiny mud kit but I already have two of those so braylon is next on this alright alright cool cool next question here is from Zeki I think I'm saying that right that they're from Canada Travis okay they'll get use out of my forecast good good i'm so glad i just listened to the live twitch podcast this would email was a little less a month ago i also believe there will be character custom a customization but i want them I want there to be a limit part of black and white black to white to that made it worth by and was seeing red again in the world tournament too much customization and everyone's character will look different you won't have an imp you so you won't have impactful returns from prior protagonists I hope gen7 will be like x and y where everyone's Calum looked the same but for different skin colors what are your thoughts on the extent of customization Zeki well in x and y i could change the haircut the clothes the Hat everything besides the skin color there was a lot of customization x and y and i would i would hope you can change the face though correct correct well i mean it was a pretty plain face but i would say also to to look to the black-and-white generation of games not cookie to keep in mind right there was the ability to transfer your custom data from black and white up to black and white 2 so that as you play through the black and white 2 storyline there would be references to things that you had done in black and white there's no reason if they were going to do like a return of a protagonist thing that they couldn't do that kind of a thing again and say transfer your customized character into the new game and have that as you're a competitor or whatever whatever they want to do with it but I think the reason red works so well in the world tournament is because red is ash like that I know that like makes a lot of people cringe or like people don't want to hear that but red and blue or ash and Gary in some extent and like the the TV show wouldn't have done so well if those characters weren't slightly related and obviously they were related and that it did work and it did pay off because we got pokemon yellow after that we got exactly what that was afterwards we got Team Rocket in yellow we got pikachu following you like that was such a big impact and fans can go oh but it's red it's not ash and it's like yes but the success came because of how successful the TV show was that actually made that character so impactful and to bring that character back does that hold up 20 years later i don't think so i think we're point in games where people either want a really really good story or they want to be they want to be some sort of characterization of their thoughts and feelings whether some people want to play as female where normal email or some females want to play as male or in destiny I want to be an alien I don't want to be human like there is people want to be they want to use their imagination and so I think what worked in black and white was because black and white had a really strong story especially around the focus of n which is why I don't like black and white but I'm on the fence of wanting to wanting that journey to be me not wanting that journey to be red or blue or silver or gold which are you know in retrospect not very good names for characters but that's besides the point this anime you name your characters colors any dine Travis what are your thoughts I don't even know what I'm reacting to at this point yeah do you like your customization or not yeah love it give me more um yeah it's it's great thought they already announced character customization for sun and moon they did they did it's just i think the question asker is is asking if we would like not only to be able to change the outfit and skin tone of our character but to also be able to have some semblance of control over height or facial features that sort of thing and i would say that that is less important to me than is then are the character customization options that were in x and y but that would be cool i'm secretly hoping for an oblivion style you guess you're super sliders that can make a strange creature when you hit randomized and then you're just stuck with this beautiful creation from from then on out that would be cool but but that's the only part of me that would be excited by the possibility of like control of her facial features or something like that i would i would rather and i think the question also kind of focuses on like the more character customization you have in your main character the last impactful that character would be if it was to come back in a future game mmm and I get that again I'm still strongly wanting as much character customization as possible because I want that to be my journey a hundred percent but I would argue instead of worrying about the protectant the the male and female protagonists I would want to see more focus on the gym leaders themselves I and this goes back to the TV show in the anime I think we all remember the red and blue gym leaders very easily because not only were we playing the game and that was the only thing to play at the time that was pre-internet but because the anime lined up with that and made that a focus whereas as much as I loved x and y and I love diamond and pearl I don't remember seven of the eight gym leaders I think black and white in particular did a great job with the gym leaders and involving them in the story I can't I can't even remember her name cuz I'm gonna say it wrong Laura Laura Laura she was the rally she was the normal type gym leader second gym leader why I remember who you're talking about but i also don't remember I don't remember like first gen gym leaders name so oh man i think i can get them all it's it's brock misty lieutenant surge Erica Sabrina Koga Giovanni that's it right no you forgot the eight Lane yes yeah they all I don't know and the only things I remember from generation to is like Faulkner Gimli just have never really meant a lot to me I don't I don't I find it I find it straight like I find it strange that I mean I understand what people care about them because they're characters in a game they like but it but they with the exception of like I was saying in black and white I feel like they are such a small part of the experience of the game like they're essentially boss fights and I don't remember the like I don't like kingdom hearts 2 is one of my favorite games but if you ask me what the boss was on The Nightmare Before Christmas level like what the second boss was I would have no idea and it's the same for me and Pokemon it's that I don't remember the characters of the gym leaders it wasn't Leonora the normal gym leader in nat green city yeah you had with so much time to look that up alright well we'll do one more session where they're like oh I here's a pop quiz over the geography of the Balkans while I have a world map in front of me from fresh air max why remember one from night one from 1975 and one from 2016 good luck everyone else I remember iris and again that that credit goes to the TV show for making iris follow ash around yeah Clemence yep orc Lamont however people say the name I last question last question here this from Colby hey guys which one of Ash's tauros is your favorite my no mine is number 17 keep up the great work Kobe wasn't that episode I cut that they didn't show it or something like that yeah that was the episode that was that was cut that was when ash catch I can't remember how many he catches but he catches a bunch of them and they all got a just randomly show because that episode didn't air at least it in there in the States than in a future episode all of these Toros come back and and as the viewer you're like oh yeah when did that happen I think of now and I'm on like this huge like Pokemon anime high of like reffered going back to the anime as a crutch here but when i when i watch wrestling will can relate to this a little bit i think even though we had 30 toros by the way oh he at 30 okay good good to know so when you watch wrestling you see all these different characters and they're all trying to be a Richter and sometimes their character doesn't work and there's there's one or two things that can happen in wrestling where it could wear something happens where you suddenly love the character there's something that they do so maybe something little something big there's a way to make a character extremely popular and so now I'm thinking back to then this probably happened in other things besides wrestling anyways but going back to the anime you look at a pokemon like Tauros and you go it's just it's just a buffalo like it's not interesting it's normal things retail it has two retails yeah but it's kind of plain it's a little vanilla and you go how can we make Toros popular how can we get the masses behind Tauros and a stunt like ash catching 30 of them and then them showing up randomly is like a great way of going you know what Taurus is actually kind of cool didn't work on me I worked on me I'm a sucker for that I think I think that like that was the moment where I'm like yeah tauros is all right also they did that with muck like muck was also a pokemon that the anime really kind of put some steam behind the muck and Professor Oak shipping relationship very very a okay in my book you want to talk about it cool shiny let's talk about tauros shiny isn't it green it is that its body is bright yellow like a lemon yellow and then it's the brown fur is like a lime green so you gotta yet like a sprite situation on your hands or sierra mist depending on your brand loyalty or seven maybe even seven up maybe you consider Mountain Dew a beverage instead of an acid good all right we'll move on to our item of the week now renamed a Jolteon watch well there are no wait don't you don now you have it I figured that we would go over the jolteon cooter re cutie pokey plush 999 hatari cutie that how you pronounce it qatari I believe so alright so this is the jolteon cutie pokey plush a recently Pokemon Center redid their website if you go to pokemon center com it does state that they redid their website it's like we'd redid things enjoy it looks almost exactly the same i think the cart icon in the upper right hand corner is slightly different the other thing I noticed is that there is a verified buyer button so the reviews that come in we can make sure that the person leaving the review is a verified buyer this might be some foreshadowing to see if one of our favorite reviewers Togepi lover is indeed a verified buyer who we won't spoil at this episode because we're focused on jolteon this is jolteon watch we watched the jolt eons here this is the QT plush a will is going to read the bullet points for you and boy they are they go well let me read the description will will tackle the bullet point sir this Joseon kirari cutie is super detailed with a zigzag rough

future in being a judge at a spelling bee oh that how children will ask you what the country of origin is and you will say Chinese which that's not a country that would be an inaccurate response hmm I guess true events language of orange bulging man ah you're just very nervous about this travel that's coming up yeah I'm just gonna i've got i got my face this entire national see I've got some style of cooking an egg that I don't know about because I'm an ignorant American I've got some sort of weird egg cooking thing and that's on my face I will I will read the first review here Travis will read the second both though I will point out are verified buyers starting with spinda em actually I don't think it shows there there's date or location anymore we lost a lot of details in the end up de-spin to em verified by our 5 out of 5 stars we switched from a Pokeball review system to a star review system about this jolteon about two weeks before Christmas as a birthday present to a good friend of mine I wonder what they got him for Christmas bite the busy shopping week it was delivered in about three to four days it was a pleasant surprise opening the package this little one was just the cutest thing it's smaller than I thought it would be and has no issue standing on a desk or a shelf my friend loved it now I want one for myself alright Travie saw you as a good review this next review is coming to you from sr hunt plush collector this is another five-star review from a verified buyer titled cute little buddy my love for jolteon is fairly new so I decided to order this qatari plush and he is adorable he's really soft and sits nightly nicely sits nightly on the top of the small TV in my bedroom however he's so cute that I keep taking him off my TV to cuddle him if you want a cheaper alternative to the more game accurate plushies but still want a nice quality plush this is perfect well this one is actually oh I thought I thought the line next to next to share meant that it had been shared but that's just to share the review yeah I think I meant one that was someone there was a one person that shared it why would you share the review like this this this is the review that convinces you to buy it right that's why you would share it could you ever imagine yourself sharing a review of a product no no not all but i'm sure some people have Oh find one well I didn't share any of these on Twitter cuz they're over 140 characters and it doesn't abbreviate them for you I uh I do have two of these QD already QD pushes I actually have a Pikachu one and i have a slowpoke one up at you or awakeish ooh ah they're both awake i like my pokemon staring me in the eyes when they're resting on top of my displays which is where they're both at one at work on top of my cinema display one here at home resting over my imac yeah they're nice quality they're 10 is worthy i would say uh but yeah that that's been your weekly jolteon watch we'll we'll wrap up this episode here we got pokemon of the week this week's pokémon to celebrate all mongooses all the time Zangoose the original mongoose Pokemon except it's not classified it as that it's classified as the cat favorite Pokemon is it really yeah that's a darn shame the cat ferret pokémon pokedex number 3 35 it is not known to evolve it is well known for an ongoing feud with seviper which in retrospect is a real good name for pokemon that is a snake ongoing feud is also a good like post-hardcore band name I'll just read a little bit here before Travis gets to a move set zangoose is bitter enemies with Seviper which it has battled against for many generations it's claws are its best weapon weapons and it can be used for its former signature move crush claw it lives in grassy areas it's a sad day in Pokemon Britain Pokemon facts that signature moves are taken away from pokemon i think crustal knows crush claw now does anybody think that zangoose very has a striking resemblance to 70s era David Bowie now that you mention it that makes sense I don't know if it's on purpose but you there's there's certainly some star dusting happening of the variety and his name starts with Z like Ziggy mom's a question though where were the spiders actually I can't finish this line because he says a line that i wouldn't say i wanna show with kids on it what other the line can i say from Ziggy Stardust he played a left hand but made it too far then we were Ziggy's band the spiders were from Mars that's true you lost me but that's very great song so ye Stardust base stats of zangoose 73 HP 115 attack 60 60 60 defense special tech special defense 90 speed if you do that math real quick that is 458 and based at totals it knows the abilities immunity and toxic boost I'm sure Travis will tell you which one is better along with a move set zangoose is actually the only pokemon that has the ability toxic boost toxic boost is like guts except that it only happens with toxic are well with poison rather the way it works is your attack is increased by 50% when you when zangoose is poisoned because of that you're you're going to choose that ability / immunity immunities and ice ability makes you immune to poison the only time you would if you had the option of both of these abilities which you only do in zangoose but theoretically if there are another Pokemon that both of these ability Joyce is the only way in which immunity really gets an edge as if you're making a defensive Pokemon because you wouldn't be using that boosted attack stat so you would want to not you wouldn't waste your item slot on something that's just gonna reduce your health over time and you would be immune to poison however zangoose has terrible defensive stats so instead we're going to take advantage of its offensive stats a mostly its attacks because its speed is only 90 we are going to give it a toxic orb so that we can ensure that we are poisoned we're going to go with an adamant nature v's 252 in attack and speed and you can throw the extra four on defense now in terms of moves that are a no-brainer we have facade the reason you're going to be doing that is because facade itself doubles in its base power when the Pokemon using it is afflicted by a status condition a major one I don't believe confusion or attraction count in fact I'm sure that they don't because when you consider that that becomes a 140 based power move and your attack is being increased by fifty percent under toxic it becomes a and you're getting the same type of TAC bonus because zangoose is a normal type and facade is a normal type move you get up to a pretty wild base power if what i'm reading is is true and not a lie apparently that adds up to 350 15 base power which is unbelievable next I like close combat for some type coverage because it gives you super effective strikes on a lot of types that resists normal namely rock and steel the third and fourth slots are up to you I would include mac off on the list because it is super effective against ghost types which you would not be able to hit with either facade or not or so facade or close combat but the unfortunate thing there is that you only knock off is only powerful when you're actively knocking off an item so you could alternatively go with shadow claw there if you always want to be super effective and deal decent damage to ghost types as opposed to having one very strong attack that you hope kills it for the fourth move we could either go with protect to ensure that you get your toxic or off and you're poisoned before you even make an attack so that you're not losing a lot of HP when you're not dishing out a lot of damage or you could go with quick attack because zangoose is pretty slow we saw that 90 base speed which isn't going to do a lot for that reason you could consider a jolly nature as opposed to adamant but given that it's still not going out speed a lot so I would still recommend adamant especially because it really does a good job at breaking walls or defensive pokemon that's sort of where it shines so you're not really worried about that Matt's out speeding you but I lost my train of thought so I would say that the main set you're going to want to use is facade knock off close combat and protect but shadow claw and quick attack are viable options as well I think I'm done Oh zangoose is based off the Mongoose a cat-like carnivore that is well known for its ability to hunt and kill venomous snakes it also bears physical resemblance to the angora and Persian cat breeds the rival rivalry it shares the Seviper is based on our relationship between both cats and mongooses forwards makes I didn't know cats didn't like snakes hats made snakes my cat that's why they're afraid of like cucumbers or whatever are you saying I could be my cats always find a reason to bring the corpse of a garter snake into our house or sometimes even a live one what oh man I can't did that mm-hmm now you keep that you you want my kids don't go outside me hey that's not the problem yeah if you get a shiny as Angus instead of being David Bowie read it is David Bowie blue that actually might even be more Ziggy Stardust I think so yeah it's like the whole like I think right is that what we're like focusing on like that no no he's right Michael yeah lightning bolt goes through his eye though David Bowie did right yes correct on an album cover all right zinc is cool when Kelly thing about zangoose um she catch him he has a five percent um having a quick law on him yeah that's why I knew I liked him Thank this is real cool now all right I think I think that's our show for you guys the think we saved it a little bit here towards the end I didn't answer the question my favorite tauros is number 29 22 for me will I have enough favorite I love them all equally Kippy 13 all right there we go that is it Kippy is now on slack yes I am under Kippy the boss you can recognize me for my fantabulous Legend of Zelda Mudkip
