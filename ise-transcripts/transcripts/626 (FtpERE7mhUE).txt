that&#39;s like 60 bucks (4:28 - 4:32)
I mean I (4:32 - 4:37)

give them so yeah I guess we were right (4:37 - 4:45)
in them delaying suun (4:41 - 4:45)
in this well not like delaying but like (4:46 - 4:51)
s s [ __ ] is on pause because this event (4:49 - 4:54)
is yeah it&#39;s not going to be legendaries (4:51 - 4:57)
one month after another yeah yeah yeah (4:54 - 5:01)
yeah uh it is a little (4:57 - 5:02)
there&#39;s a lot of information here so (5:01 - 5:04)
we&#39;ll try to break it down it&#39;s a two we (5:02 - 5:05)
long (5:04 - 5:09)
event and the first week you don&#39;t have (5:05 - 5:11)
to go to green grass but it&#39;s only (5:09 - 5:15)
taking place on green grass so (5:11 - 5:18)
you you kind of have to that have (5:15 - 5:22)
to if you for like no I hate Pala then (5:18 - 5:26)
yes I guess go to any other location um (5:22 - 5:29)
but event area week one will be green (5:26 - 5:33)
grass event area week two you can go (5:29 - 5:36)
anywhere um and now green grass has all (5:33 - 5:39)
the starters uh but the second week if (5:36 - 5:41)
you go back to Greengrass uh you&#39;re (5:39 - 5:45)
going to get spatio Flora Meara Fuoco (5:41 - 5:47)
and quackley if you decide to go to cion (5:45 - 5:49)
beach the second week you can do Fu Coco (5:47 - 5:55)
COC calore skurge quaxi quaw well qual (5:49 - 5:59)
you go to topalo that&#39;s Fu Coco calor (5:55 - 6:00)
skurge (5:59 - 6:03)
if you go to (6:00 - 6:05)
Snowdrop nothing don&#39;t don&#39;t go to snow (6:03 - 6:07)
drop they aren&#39;t ice (6:05 - 6:10)
starters and then if you go to lapis (6:07 - 6:14)
Lakeside you&#39;ll get spto Fato masasa (6:10 - 6:16)
quackley quell quack ball that is (6:14 - 6:18)
already my week two destination I&#39;ve (6:16 - 6:21)
decided I think that&#39;s my week two (6:18 - 6:23)
destination well that&#39;s my week two I I (6:21 - 6:26)
am not a huge F Coco fan so I&#39;ll take (6:23 - 6:29)
the others thank you it&#39;s also not not (6:26 - 6:32)
great doesn&#39;t have a great ability main (6:29 - 6:34)
skill yeah do you Hannah do you want to (6:32 - 6:36)
talk about the the three main skills (6:34 - 6:38)
because they are not the same as our (6:36 - 6:41)
first set of starters yeah so those the (6:38 - 6:44)
main skills for all of these new Pokemon (6:41 - 6:46)
in the game have already been the data (6:44 - 6:48)
is already there we can tell what they (6:46 - 6:50)
are all three of the lines are going to (6:48 - 6:52)
be ingredients finders and all three of (6:50 - 6:54)
the lines are going to change types as (6:52 - 6:58)
they evolve so once uh Meara becomes (6:54 - 7:01)
Meara it will be dark Skeletor will be (6:58 - 7:03)
ghost and qual will be fighting whereas (7:01 - 7:06)
their pre-evolutions are all the main (7:03 - 7:10)
starter types each of their main skills (7:06 - 7:14)
are different the spro line has the (7:10 - 7:17)
cooking power up S main skill so that&#39;s (7:14 - 7:19)
the one that makes your pot bigger for (7:17 - 7:22)
more ingredients as you cook your meals (7:19 - 7:25)
The Quay Coco line has the charge energy (7:22 - 7:28)
s skill so that one is only going to (7:25 - 7:31)
restore energy to it itself which is why (7:28 - 7:35)
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as good as the others (7:31 - 7:38)
and the quackle line is going to have (7:35 - 7:40)
the charge strength M and that&#39;s the one (7:38 - 7:42)
that&#39;s the skill that I&#39;m never quite (7:40 - 7:43)
sure how I feel about it that&#39;s just (7:42 - 7:47)
going to increase snorlax&#39;s (7:43 - 7:50)
strength yeah the real the real hardcore (7:47 - 7:52)
whales love the the charge M because (7:50 - 7:55)
they can put all their seeds and candy (7:52 - 7:59)
and it it is really powerful but like (7:55 - 8:01)
you have to get it to level six or level (7:59 - 8:04)
seven for it to really be influential (8:01 - 8:06)
and that&#39;s that&#39;s a lot of resources (8:04 - 8:08)
that even somebody who is paying $10 a (8:06 - 8:10)
month just for the the past they they (8:08 - 8:13)
don&#39;t that&#39;s me I don&#39;t have access to (8:10 - 8:15)
that say it to (8:13 - 8:17)
you that that that is like a that is (8:15 - 8:20)
like real hardcore whale um I think (8:17 - 8:21)
quack waval seems very similar to like (8:20 - 8:23)
the gold duck line in that sense but (8:21 - 8:24)
just (8:23 - 8:27)
fighting and gold duck is water um but (8:24 - 8:30)
they&#39;re both Ducks so that there&#39;s at (8:27 - 8:33)
least Synergy there duck (8:30 - 8:35)
team (8:33 - 8:39)
I think that (8:35 - 8:42)
so the eveve line is one of the more (8:39 - 8:44)
complicated lines in the game because (8:42 - 8:46)
they do change when they evolve uh there (8:44 - 8:47)
are other Pokemon that change when they (8:46 - 8:50)
they evolve like Pupitar changes to dark (8:47 - 8:53)
goes from Rock to dark when it goes to (8:50 - 8:56)
Tyranitar um swablu goes from flying to (8:53 - 9:01)
Dragon when it evolves into Altaria (8:56 - 9:03)
there was a point I was going there oh (9:01 - 9:05)
uh going back to the Eevee line uh this (9:03 - 9:07)
I think pretty much makes glacon (9:05 - 9:11)
completely useless uh so if you were (9:07 - 9:14)
maybe so if you like glacon one I&#39;m (9:11 - 9:16)
sorry but (9:14 - 9:22)
two but two glacon wasn&#39;t really super (9:16 - 9:27)
strong and meow Scara is dark which dark (9:22 - 9:30)
and Ice are both on Snowdrop and the (9:27 - 9:33)
both end up doing the cooking pot thing (9:30 - 9:35)
and it just (9:33 - 9:38)
because the starters have been very (9:35 - 9:40)
powerful compared to other Pokemon it (9:38 - 9:42)
just seems (9:40 - 9:45)
like Meara will (9:42 - 9:48)
make glacon pretty obsolete we&#39;ve (9:45 - 9:51)
already started seeing this power creep (9:48 - 9:54)
with Ralts and beware and what was the (9:51 - 9:57)
last one oh Dragon (9:54 - 10:00)
Dragonite um and like ultimately (9:57 - 10:02)
technically Ralts makes like Wiggly tff (10:00 - 10:04)
and Sylveon obsolete because it is the (10:02 - 10:06)
best one of those they&#39;re still like (10:04 - 10:09)
Niche CES of course and like you should (10:06 - 10:10)
still get a wiggly tough if that&#39;s (10:09 - 10:13)
you&#39;re still a beginner um because it (10:10 - 10:15)
takes a while to get a ra as somebody (10:13 - 10:17)
who has had lapis unlocked for several (10:15 - 10:19)
months I still do not have a good enough (10:17 - 10:20)
RS so (10:19 - 10:24)
just but um yeah I think this is just a (10:20 - 10:27)
little bit more of a power creep nothing (10:24 - 10:29)
like that&#39;s going to break the game but (10:27 - 10:31)
at least Le in the glacian situation it (10:29 - 10:32)
seems (10:31 - 10:36)
like maybe go the mowar route also like (10:32 - 10:41)
meara&#39;s real popular it is it also seems (10:36 - 10:44)
like it might be the best of all of (10:41 - 10:47)
these starters I agree I think so yeah (10:44 - 10:51)
just typewise and skill-wise (10:47 - 10:54)
there might even be a case of keeping it (10:51 - 11:00)
as a flora mhm so that for lapis yeah (10:54 - 11:05)
um which there is no grass cooking pot (11:00 - 11:06)
up (11:05 - 11:09)
so that&#39;s that&#39;s something there&#39;s some (11:06 - 11:10)
other events or other things that are (11:09 - 11:12)
happening research will be multiplied by (11:10 - 11:15)
1.5 uh few Pokemon will appear (11:12 - 11:16)
regardless of the (11:15 - 11:19)
sleep a dream gift can be received each (11:16 - 11:22)
day um during the first (11:19 - 11:24)
week one Pokemon will arrive hungry for (11:22 - 11:26)
sure the chance of a Pokemon&#39;s main (11:24 - 11:30)
skill trigger will be 1.5 (11:26 - 11:31)
certain Pokemon more likely to appear (11:30 - 11:33)
the second week the number of candies (11:31 - 11:35)
gained through sleep will be multiplied (11:33 - 11:39)
1.5 uh final dishes gained uh will be (11:35 - 11:43)
multiplied by 1.5 or three for extra (11:39 - 11:46)
tasty dishes or 4.5 for extra tasty (11:43 - 11:49)
dishes on Sunday so get your crar ANS (11:46 - 11:52)
rev up those crar ANS uh for the second (11:49 - 11:55)
week certain Pokémon more likely appear (11:52 - 11:56)
during sleep research and then the (11:55 - 12:00)
limited time mini candy boost function (11:56 - 12:01)
will (12:00 - 12:03)
return (12:01 - 12:06)
so I think I think we pounded this drum (12:03 - 12:09)
for months that like if you want new (12:06 - 12:12)
players to come to the game legendaries (12:09 - 12:15)
and starter Pokemon are like the easy (12:12 - 12:18)
low hanging fruit to get people to jump (12:15 - 12:21)
on board for your for your game and they (12:18 - 12:24)
know this and they&#39;re they are very (12:21 - 12:27)
effectively using (12:24 - 12:27)
it um and yeah and then talked about (12:27 - 12:35)
their their types changing and their (12:31 - 12:36)
skills (12:35 - 12:39)
skill skills are different um and then (12:36 - 12:42)
the only other Pokemon sleep news is (12:39 - 12:44)
where did that article go uh that (12:42 - 12:47)
Pokemon sleep hit 100 million downloads (12:44 - 12:50)
oh no sorry it made 100 where is this (12:47 - 12:52)
article hold (12:50 - 12:56)
on it made a $100 million in Revenue its (12:52 - 12:59)
first year there we go (12:56 - 13:01)
and that is off (12:59 - 13:02)
gamesindustry.biz (13:01 - 13:06)
[Music] (13:02 - 13:09)
um as reported by Pocket Gamer Japan was (13:06 - 13:12)
in the top spot for players spending (13:09 - 13:15)
players have contributed $73 million (13:12 - 13:17)
since its launch in (13:15 - 13:21)
July uh us players only us players Greg (13:17 - 13:24)
you got to step it up you and the other (13:21 - 13:27)
us players have only contributed $15 (13:24 - 13:31)
million look I&#39;m not not spending a dime (13:27 - 13:34)
until my favorite Pokemon makes it into (13:31 - 13:37)
that game until then they&#39;re cut (13:34 - 13:39)
off and then (13:37 - 13:44)
Taiwan spent $4 million in the game (13:39 - 13:46)
Pokemon sleep has seen peaks of Revenue (13:44 - 13:49)
during the height of 2023 holiday period (13:46 - 13:52)
where $4 million were earned in a week (13:49 - 13:55)
of the last December was there an event (13:52 - 13:58)
there was like a a Christmas New Year&#39;s (13:55 - 14:01)
Event wasn&#39;t there with like jelly bird (13:58 - 14:03)
mhm (14:01 - 14:09)
yep um and then 44% of the (14:03 - 14:09)
players uh or 44% of the downloads are (14:10 - 14:18)
from Japan 177% from the US and 7% from (14:13 - 14:22)
Taiwan so those are your three biggest (14:18 - 14:24)
markets I think for Pokémon go the three (14:22 - 14:26)
biggest markets are obviously us and (14:24 - 14:28)
Japan and I think the third one is (14:26 - 14:30)
actually Germany uh (14:28 - 14:32)
and that&#39;s why there was a lot of (14:30 - 14:35)
Pokemon go Fest for several years in (14:32 - 14:37)
Germany there&#39;s like no secret there of (14:35 - 14:41)
like why they kept going back to (14:37 - 14:41)
Germany so um I think uh let me see if I (14:41 - 14:48)
can pull these numbers up I&#39;m pretty (14:45 - 14:53)
sure Pokemon Masters ex made $70 million (14:48 - 14:57)
in its first year and Pokemon go made I (14:53 - 15:00)
believe 450 m million dollars in its (14:57 - 15:01)
first (15:00 - 15:04)
year okay so Pokemon sleep&#39;s doing (15:01 - 15:07)
pretty well (15:04 - 15:13)
yeah all things considered I think 25% (15:07 - 15:17)
of what Pokemon go did is really good (15:13 - 15:19)
that&#39;s very (15:17 - 15:19)
good uh that being said I (15:21 - 15:27)
think not to burst the Pokemon go the (15:24 - 15:29)
Pokemon bubble but I believe believe (15:27 - 15:33)
that hanai star rail made like $25 (15:29 - 15:37)
million in its first week of being a (15:33 - 15:43)
mobile game yeah uh and okay the the (15:37 - 15:47)
next HOA verse game which is uh what&#39;s (15:43 - 15:50)
it called zzz just came out so I think (15:47 - 15:52)
as of recording it&#39;s been out for a week (15:50 - 15:56)
but we won&#39;t know what that is (15:52 - 15:59)
but but very popular at least right now (15:56 - 16:01)
so maybe next week when we have more (15:59 - 16:03)
time (16:01 - 16:06)
we&#39;ll we&#39;ll like revisit this and kind (16:03 - 16:09)
of talk about maybe other comparing this (16:06 - 16:11)
to other mobile games and what they&#39;re (16:09 - 16:13)
doing but like like what we were saying (16:11 - 16:16)
last week um don&#39;t know the future of (16:13 - 16:21)
Cafe mix but like this is a good sign (16:16 - 16:24)
for Pokemon sleep $100 million in a (16:21 - 16:25)
year (16:24 - 16:29)
uh and Pokemon Masters ex still seems to (16:25 - 16:30)
be (16:29 - 16:35)
very okay with with their their revenue (16:30 - 16:37)
they&#39;re doing it&#39;s pretty solid for (16:35 - 16:41)
Pokemon Masters yeah for Pokemon sleep (16:37 - 16:43)
though I mean they&#39;re seeming to be (16:41 - 16:46)
pretty successful and they are still (16:43 - 16:50)
being good to their users so far just (16:46 - 16:52)
going back to the anniversary event (16:50 - 16:55)
we&#39;re getting gifts every single day for (16:52 - 17:00)
two weeks in that app for the event (16:55 - 17:02)
which is not something I would expect in (17:00 - 17:05)
Pokémon go (17:02 - 17:08)
ever at any (17:05 - 17:08)
point so I don&#39;t know Pokemon sleep&#39;s (17:09 - 17:14)
doing pretty good and it&#39;s going to be (17:12 - 17:16)
an exciting two weeks starting the day (17:14 - 17:17)
this episode comes (17:16 - 17:21)
out yeah I think (17:17 - 17:23)
um I think if you played Pokemon sleep (17:21 - 17:25)
and you just didn&#39;t like it I don&#39;t I (17:23 - 17:26)
don&#39;t think this event is going to like (17:25 - 17:31)
convince you or change anything um (17:26 - 17:31)
but if you haven&#39;t maybe maybe it&#39;s uh (17:32 - 17:39)
maybe it&#39;s time to jump back (17:36 - 17:39)
in I feel like this has a bigger (17:39 - 17:44)
commitment for jump like if you want to (17:42 - 17:45)
jump back into Masters you can do a TP (17:44 - 17:47)
couple of pulls be like yeah I got what (17:45 - 17:50)
I wanted and I get out like sleep has (17:47 - 17:53)
has a sleep commitment and of days at (17:50 - 17:56)
least 24 hours to sort of be like is (17:53 - 17:57)
this what I (17:56 - 18:00)
want it&#39;s very like Animal Crossing (17:57 - 18:02)
where you can&#39;t just like sit down and (18:00 - 18:04)
play for an hour and be like okay I&#39;ll (18:02 - 18:06)

Pokemon sleep we will be right back and (21:47 - 21:52)
we are back from our (21:50 - 21:55)
break uh let&#39;s talk about Pokemon go (21:52 - 21:57)
Fest New (21:55 - 22:01)
York all three of of us were there um I (21:57 - 22:04)
been to I I went to all three I&#39;ve been (22:01 - 22:10)
to every go Fest GRE was not every yeah (22:04 - 22:13)
not every I&#39;ve been to at least one go (22:10 - 22:17)
Fest for every year yes yes uh Greg you (22:13 - 22:20)
can start how was your go (22:17 - 22:23)
Fest I had a lot of fun the thing that (22:20 - 22:24)
made it terrible it&#39;s the thing they (22:23 - 22:27)
couldn&#39;t have controlled which was the (22:24 - 22:32)
heat um it was abysmally hot and because (22:27 - 22:36)
of the heat my very ancient phone at the (22:32 - 22:39)
by phone standards was like I am done (22:36 - 22:41)
I&#39;m G to quit for a while and would just (22:39 - 22:45)
be done and wouldn&#39;t do anything uh (22:41 - 22:47)
overall again the number one reason why (22:45 - 22:50)
I go to these things is to see all the (22:47 - 22:52)
people that I can see nowhere else like (22:50 - 22:55)
it is that always is the best part of (22:52 - 22:57)
all of these events spending three days (22:55 - 23:00)
just being with like-minded and fun (22:57 - 23:03)
people and running around a big city uh (23:00 - 23:06)
all trying to not pass up from heat (23:03 - 23:09)
exhaustion it it it&#39;s a fun experience (23:06 - 23:13)
the game is the game I I wish I still (23:09 - 23:14)
think (23:13 - 23:18)
the I&#39;m always torn on the Park section (23:14 - 23:21)
of it um I really wish they had more (23:18 - 23:25)
tents because it was the north end of (23:21 - 23:26)
that Park was (23:25 - 23:29)
brutal uh and everybody was like killing (23:26 - 23:31)
the grass under the few trees that (23:29 - 23:34)
existed to try to get out of the Blazing (23:31 - 23:36)
heat (23:34 - 23:38)
um and I think like I was trying to like (23:36 - 23:40)
if they had put up those misters would (23:38 - 23:42)
that have helped except the humidity was (23:40 - 23:44)
so oppressive I don&#39;t think even being (23:42 - 23:47)
misted would have helped cool people (23:44 - 23:50)
down because you we were all sweating (23:47 - 23:52)
but it was so humid the sweat could go (23:50 - 23:54)
nowhere you were just always sort of (23:52 - 23:59)
damp and hot um I had a lot of fun the (23:54 - 24:01)
Saturday when it was just a bunch of us (23:59 - 24:03)
sitting in Bryant Park we sat there for (24:01 - 24:05)
hours in the shade uh and then would do (24:03 - 24:07)
little laps around it was very (24:05 - 24:08)
comforting and we could just see people (24:07 - 24:14)
coming and going and playing um the I (24:08 - 24:16)
got my marshadow which I&#39;m happy I sort (24:14 - 24:19)
of wish they were a bit more clear about (24:16 - 24:21)
how (24:19 - 24:23)
the in the (24:21 - 24:26)
park research went because I did the (24:23 - 24:27)
first part and then we were on the North (24:26 - 24:29)
side it&#39;s like hey do all these things (24:27 - 24:32)
that only exist on the South Side so had (24:29 - 24:33)
to go all the way around to the South (24:32 - 24:35)
Side knowing that I would do those and (24:33 - 24:36)
have to rush back over to the north side (24:35 - 24:38)
where I just was to complete those (24:36 - 24:41)
sections of it so I kind of wish that (24:38 - 24:44)
that they were just all together as one (24:41 - 24:47)
task so that wherever you were you could (24:44 - 24:49)
complete that section and move to the (24:47 - 24:51)
other section um because I I didn&#39;t make (24:49 - 24:53)
sense that they were broken up nothing (24:51 - 24:55)
really important happened between those (24:53 - 24:57)
two they want you to move plot lines we (24:55 - 24:59)
had to move anyways (24:57 - 25:01)
one task you could have started at where (24:59 - 25:03)
you were and finished it at the other (25:01 - 25:05)
yeah and you don&#39;t want people coming in (25:03 - 25:06)
all from the south entrance you want (25:05 - 25:08)
everybody to be kind of spread out but (25:06 - 25:11)
if the tasks are all directing you from (25:08 - 25:14)
the south to the north yeah it created a (25:11 - 25:18)
big Jam in the Middle with some very (25:14 - 25:21)
very excitable volunteers who are doing (25:18 - 25:23)
anything to keep their (25:21 - 25:26)
s in that heat I felt so bad for (25:23 - 25:29)
them uh Hannah this was you went to last (25:26 - 25:32)
year&#39;s as well yeah it was at the same (25:29 - 25:37)
place what did it feel different yes (25:32 - 25:41)
last year was not anywhere near as (25:37 - 25:43)
challenging weather (25:41 - 25:46)
was that uh I started every single day (25:43 - 25:49)
out this past weekend going I like it (25:46 - 25:52)
when it&#39;s humid out I am someone who (25:49 - 25:54)
prefers being too hot to too cold I (25:52 - 25:58)
would down like 50 oun of liquid in the (25:54 - 26:00)
morning think that wouldn&#39;t have me set (25:58 - 26:02)
for so much of the rest of the day and (26:00 - 26:06)
then by 1 or 2 p.m. I it was it was bad (26:02 - 26:09)
yeah it it was a swelter swelter time in (26:06 - 26:11)
New York and New York itself has so many (26:09 - 26:13)
people and so many cars that like the (26:11 - 26:17)
city itself is always just generating a (26:13 - 26:20)
lot of heat so you&#39;re with a lot of (26:17 - 26:22)
people in a very hot place there are (26:20 - 26:24)
number of stores that got my business CU (26:22 - 26:26)
I&#39;m like I&#39;m coming in here for (26:24 - 26:30)
approximately half an hour I for pizza (26:26 - 26:32)
they had the windows open and the pizza (26:30 - 26:34)
oven blasting and I&#39;m like we are going (26:32 - 26:38)
to die in here it is so hot and there&#39;s (26:34 - 26:40)
hot air blowing in from outside there&#39;s (26:38 - 26:43)
hot air blowing from their ovens this is (26:40 - 26:46)
just miserable yeah but when you could (26:43 - 26:48)
find a space in the shade and there was (26:46 - 26:50)
just every once in a while a breeze like (26:48 - 26:54)
if you could just sit and relax it was (26:50 - 26:56)
it was a lovely summer time but if you (26:54 - 26:57)
had to go anywhere especially you had to (26:56 - 26:59)
go anywhere in that sun it was like like (26:57 - 27:02)
this is this is bad which I was like I (26:59 - 27:05)
don&#39;t know that I had a fun time at the (27:02 - 27:07)
park because it was so brutal being (27:05 - 27:10)
there yeah because there&#39;s almost no (27:07 - 27:13)
shade there and that wasn&#39;t as much of a (27:10 - 27:15)
problem last year I don&#39;t remember it (27:13 - 27:17)
being something I really actively (27:15 - 27:19)
thought about as much I mean I know I (27:17 - 27:21)
got sunburnt last year I succeeded at (27:19 - 27:23)
not getting sunburnt this year I think (27:21 - 27:27)
um sunscreen is good and helpful um but (27:23 - 27:29)
this year we were (27:27 - 27:31)
dodging the sun we were headed from (27:29 - 27:34)
Shady place to Shady place as much as we (27:31 - 27:36)
could except that every single Shady (27:34 - 27:40)
location was completely packed and the (27:36 - 27:42)
water refill stations were overrun (27:40 - 27:45)
throughout the entire time every time I (27:42 - 27:48)
saw them and it was it was interesting I (27:45 - 27:51)
mean we&#39;re all suffering together um (27:48 - 27:53)
like you said Greg this is a really (27:51 - 27:55)
really good time to see people and and (27:53 - 27:57)
it really is more for the people for me (27:55 - 28:00)
than it is for the Pokemon and for the (27:57 - 28:03)
yeah catching anything I didn&#39;t have any (28:00 - 28:05)
super solid goals that it would have (28:03 - 28:06)
ruined my weekend if I hadn&#39;t caught (28:05 - 28:09)
this Pokemon that&#39;s not what go fast is (28:06 - 28:14)
about for me um but I was it was it was (28:09 - 28:18)
tricky challenging weather was I&#39;m (28:14 - 28:20)
really hoping that my enjoyment and my (28:18 - 28:22)
happiness stayed in my voice because I (28:20 - 28:25)
know that I probably seemed I I think (28:22 - 28:27)
everybody was slightly beat down doing (28:25 - 28:29)
the best we could like on Saturday I&#39;m (28:27 - 28:31)
like well maybe I&#39;ll head over to the (28:29 - 28:32)
park at 1 when everything&#39;s shutting (28:31 - 28:34)
down and meet every everybody because I (28:32 - 28:37)
did not leave my hotel until 11 that (28:34 - 28:39)
morning uh because I also didn&#39;t get (28:37 - 28:42)
into my hotel until like 1 at night the (28:39 - 28:44)
night before so I was like oh maybe I&#39;ll (28:42 - 28:45)
go over there and they stepped outside (28:44 - 28:47)
I&#39;m like I&#39;m not going to that (28:45 - 28:50)
Park I look if there&#39;s people there I (28:47 - 28:52)
can&#39;t see anywhere else I&#39;m sorry but I (28:50 - 28:54)
am not going to that brutal Park you (28:52 - 28:57)
know and I went to the park two days in (28:54 - 28:59)
a row because the first I was going (28:57 - 29:01)
there to meet up with you two to take (28:59 - 29:07)
our picture um and we took the long (29:01 - 29:10)
super hot sweltering bridge over there (29:07 - 29:12)
that first time honestly I think I took (29:10 - 29:13)
almost every single bridge over to that (29:12 - 29:16)
Island other than the North facing ones (29:13 - 29:18)
that weekend and so I I have a ranking (29:16 - 29:20)
of the bridges these are the good (29:18 - 29:22)
Bridges these are the bad bridges yeah (29:20 - 29:24)
the south facing (29:22 - 29:30)
bridge is super long super hot uh uh (29:24 - 29:32)
bad the (29:30 - 29:36)
Northwest Bridge yes that we walked over (29:32 - 29:40)
after the second day on the island also (29:36 - 29:43)
maybe the worst experience temperature (29:40 - 29:45)
wise I have ever experienced it felt (29:43 - 29:47)
like walking through a desert the (29:45 - 29:50)
Southwest Bridge it it&#39;s a shorter (29:47 - 29:52)
bridge but it&#39;s still longer than the (29:50 - 29:54)
Southwest Bridge the Southwest bridge is (29:52 - 29:56)
the best Bridge there is some shade it (29:54 - 29:59)
is somewhat cooler there are plants (29:56 - 30:03)
it&#39;s not just (29:59 - 30:06)
horrible but it also doesn&#39;t have spawns (30:03 - 30:10)
so we didn&#39;t walk over that bridge um I (30:06 - 30:14)
think it would be very hypocritical of (30:10 - 30:18)
me to one not talk about getting to the (30:14 - 30:21)
park and two taking an Uber to the park (30:18 - 30:24)
because I have come on this show event (30:21 - 30:27)
after event being like my feedback to (30:24 - 30:29)
Niantic was (30:27 - 30:31)
Parks need to be accessible they need to (30:29 - 30:34)
be easy to get to if we everyone (30:31 - 30:37)
remembers the internet going down in Las (30:34 - 30:39)
Vegas that wasn&#39;t my problem in Las (30:37 - 30:41)
Vegas because they eventually fixed it (30:39 - 30:43)
took them a extra took them like two (30:41 - 30:45)
hours to fix they extended everyone&#39;s (30:43 - 30:48)
play that&#39;s fine the problem with the (30:45 - 30:50)
the Las Vegas Park was there was no (30:48 - 30:53)
public transportation and it was a (30:50 - 30:54)
pretty small Park compared to those (30:53 - 30:57)
parks and your only way on and off was (30:54 - 31:01)
Uber and Uber in Las Vegas is already (30:57 - 31:04)
not a great experience so you could take (31:01 - 31:06)
an Uber to this park I don&#39;t know how (31:04 - 31:09)
much it was I didn&#39;t take it Uber only (31:06 - 31:11)
kind of they really tried to make it (31:09 - 31:13)
impossible I know there was at least one (31:11 - 31:15)
person in our group who did take an Uber (31:13 - 31:18)
to on the island and who basically got (31:15 - 31:21)
yelled at by yeah they were staff of the (31:18 - 31:23)
event they were not happy with any (31:21 - 31:25)
individual cars at all it was either (31:23 - 31:28)
take the bus or walk over they I saw a (31:25 - 31:29)
couple times like a car was driving and (31:28 - 31:32)
they were actively hostile like turn (31:29 - 31:34)
turn around get that out of here yeah on (31:32 - 31:36)
their map there were markings for places (31:34 - 31:38)
they wanted people to Uber to they were (31:36 - 31:40)
all off the island and then you would (31:38 - 31:41)
take the bridges and walk on the bridges (31:40 - 31:43)
to get on the island yeah yeah yeah (31:41 - 31:45)
which is not these are long Bridges (31:43 - 31:46)
they&#39;re long Brides these aren&#39;t short (31:45 - 31:49)
bridges no the (31:46 - 31:54)
fairy was the play I so I&#39;m a solid I Am (31:49 - 31:57)
pro team fery my hotel was near the fery (31:54 - 31:59)
landing for (31:57 - 32:03)
reason it was easy brilliant you&#39;re on (31:59 - 32:05)
water it was a (32:03 - 32:08)
lovely trip both (32:05 - 32:12)
ways I heard the trip out was (32:08 - 32:14)
bad I mean you were we were on the trip (32:12 - 32:17)
out you and I were on the same Ferry no (32:14 - 32:19)
no no the trip off the island no why was (32:17 - 32:21)
the trip off the island bad but okay but (32:19 - 32:24)
you didn&#39;t try to leave at one Greg (32:21 - 32:25)
because we were waiting for Hannah for (32:24 - 32:26)
the picture (32:25 - 32:31)
Yeah but I I was I was told so so I took (32:26 - 32:33)
the ferry too Greg and I took the ferry (32:31 - 32:36)
on Friday to the park uh it was a good (32:33 - 32:39)
experience I think it was like $22 one (32:36 - 32:41)
way took you right into the park we got (32:39 - 32:43)
there five minutes before the event (32:41 - 32:46)
started everything worked great um I (32:43 - 32:48)
tried to take the ferry the second day (32:46 - 32:51)
but they just stopped selling tickets (32:48 - 32:54)
even though it was like 9:30 a.m. and I (32:51 - 32:56)
was like I would assume you would still (32:54 - 32:58)
be running fairies at like 93010 (32:56 - 33:01)
but Saturday did sell out Sunday did not (32:58 - 33:03)
sell out and Friday did not sell out so (33:01 - 33:06)
maybe that&#39;s why they stopped selling (33:03 - 33:10)
tickets unsure um so the ways I got to (33:06 - 33:12)
the park was the ferry and then we (33:10 - 33:14)
walked off the park with Hannah the (33:12 - 33:16)
second the first day which was the (33:14 - 33:20)
Southwest I think you said MH and then (33:16 - 33:24)
the um second day I took the train super (33:20 - 33:28)
easy three stops Express $2.90 (33:24 - 33:29)
train station was two blocks away from (33:28 - 33:31)
that bridge we just talked about you (33:29 - 33:33)
walk off the bridge you&#39;re there and (33:31 - 33:35)
then we we pretty much took that same (33:33 - 33:41)
train back into the city um so like (33:35 - 33:43)
transportation to the park because there (33:41 - 33:46)
was also buses there was also (33:43 - 33:48)
technically Uber if you didn&#39;t want to (33:46 - 33:50)
take the train where people like didn&#39;t (33:48 - 33:52)
want to take the train like you like (33:50 - 33:55)
there there was multiple ways to get on (33:52 - 33:57)
and off the island which I appreciate (33:55 - 33:59)
mhm (33:57 - 34:02)
that that island and I I am saying this (33:59 - 34:05)
very strongly not lightly is the worst (34:02 - 34:08)
Park they have ever picked out of all (34:05 - 34:12)
eight years that Park is terrible it (34:08 - 34:15)
it&#39;s no shade it (34:12 - 34:18)
looks visually (34:15 - 34:19)
bad (34:18 - 34:24)
um like it&#39;s and there&#39;s like a giant (34:19 - 34:26)
construction zone in the middle and (34:24 - 34:28)
every single person I talked to that was (34:26 - 34:30)
there last year uh I was like was this (34:28 - 34:31)
construction zone here last year and (34:30 - 34:33)
they were like yep and I was like did (34:31 - 34:34)
they make any progress on it from last (34:33 - 34:36)
year they were like nope construction (34:34 - 34:38)
wise no but Niantic knew that it was (34:36 - 34:40)
there this time so at least they made (34:38 - 34:42)
that kind of a dead zone and routed (34:40 - 34:44)
people around it in a slightly easier (34:42 - 34:49)
way this time slightly but I mean the (34:44 - 34:52)
the amount of open space was (34:49 - 34:55)
somewhat accounted for on the South Side (34:52 - 34:58)
by Big T there needed to be more of them (34:55 - 35:00)
and the thought of walking across that (34:58 - 35:01)
death parking loot to get to the (35:00 - 35:04)
merchandise Booth yeah yep absolutely (35:01 - 35:06)
not people like well come with me to (35:04 - 35:08)
pick up I&#39;m like I not walking across (35:06 - 35:10)
molten lava right now you feel your (35:08 - 35:12)
shoes melting there that&#39;s why the (35:10 - 35:15)
island felt like a frying pan because (35:12 - 35:18)
they had a giant parking lot that just (35:15 - 35:20)
heated up where the merch like that it (35:18 - 35:22)
was for those that weren&#39;t there there (35:20 - 35:25)
was like this nice grassy area and then (35:22 - 35:27)
that was next to like a stadium and the (35:25 - 35:28)
first day there were like people like (35:27 - 35:31)
running track at that stadium and then (35:28 - 35:33)
there was a parking lot behind the (35:31 - 35:35)
stadium and then next to that was just a (35:33 - 35:39)
giant cement field that was equal in (35:35 - 35:41)
equal in size to the green part of this (35:39 - 35:45)
park and then at the end of this C field (35:41 - 35:46)
because it wasn&#39;t a parking lot it was (35:45 - 35:50)
just pure concrete poured was the merch (35:46 - 35:52)
tent and there was there was not enough (35:50 - 35:55)
trees there was like not enough Greenery (35:52 - 35:58)
like it was just a bad (35:55 - 36:02)
Park yeah and the construction (35:58 - 36:04)
construction zone that separated the two (36:02 - 36:06)
parks technically their two (36:04 - 36:11)
parks was all cement and all it you&#39;re (36:06 - 36:12)
literally walking through a construction (36:11 - 36:14)
zone from one park to the other and the (36:12 - 36:17)
other side of the park some good things (36:14 - 36:19)
about the park they had food trucks on (36:17 - 36:20)
both sides they had water stations on (36:19 - 36:21)
both sides they should have had more (36:20 - 36:23)
water stations but like they had had (36:21 - 36:27)
more tents a lot more tents anything for (36:23 - 36:29)
shade more (36:27 - 36:32)
better water stations they they should (36:29 - 36:34)
have there I haven&#39;t been to a single go (36:32 - 36:37)
Fest where there isn&#39;t more than one (36:34 - 36:39)
team Mystic team Valor team Instinct and (36:37 - 36:41)
there there should be there should be (36:39 - 36:46)
more of those tents um but it it&#39;s not a (36:41 - 36:50)
very good (36:46 - 36:52)
Park like even the vas Park had (36:50 - 36:54)
construction we all like we talked about (36:52 - 36:56)
how a bunch of people like climbed on (36:54 - 36:58)
the giant dirt Hill and then like they (36:56 - 37:00)
needed they had to like physically put a (36:58 - 37:02)
security guard on the top of this giant (37:00 - 37:03)
dirt Hill to prevent people from (37:02 - 37:06)
climbing (37:03 - 37:06)
it but at least like that Park had like (37:07 - 37:14)
different biomes and there was one part (37:11 - 37:17)
of that Park that was incredibly shaded (37:14 - 37:20)
um with like the pond and everything (37:17 - 37:23)
and like it was a it it was a cool park (37:20 - 37:25)
for what it was like I&#39;m sure it&#39;s (37:23 - 37:27)
better now cuz they were in midst of (37:25 - 37:30)
construction to that Park but there like (37:27 - 37:33)
if you were to remove all the Pokémon Go (37:30 - 37:35)
stuff from rand&#39;s (37:33 - 37:38)
Island it&#39;s just grass and cement and (37:35 - 37:40)
like four and like four trees like it&#39;s (37:38 - 37:43)
such a bad park there are more than (37:40 - 37:44)
there are more trees than that they&#39;re (37:43 - 37:46)
just young trees it&#39;s going to take some (37:44 - 37:48)
timean they&#39;re young trees they&#39;re on (37:46 - 37:51)
the perimeter which isn&#39;t particularly (37:48 - 37:55)
helpful yeah and I understand like (37:51 - 37:57)
they&#39;re keeping the middle open for what (37:55 - 38:00)
other other events that you would do (37:57 - 38:02)
like concerts and stuff where trees (38:00 - 38:04)
would get damaged and ruined fine like I (38:02 - 38:07)
get all that you know those trees aren&#39;t (38:04 - 38:10)
there put up a tent put up large (38:07 - 38:14)
umbrellas put up anything to get shade (38:10 - 38:17)
it was not a secret that it was going to (38:14 - 38:22)
be hot a month before that trip like we (38:17 - 38:23)
everybody knew it was going to be at (38:22 - 38:26)
least in the 80s possibly the &#39;90s I (38:23 - 38:28)
mean it there were heat of advisories (38:26 - 38:31)
like it it was 93 de but the because of (38:28 - 38:35)
the humidity it felt like 105 each day (38:31 - 38:37)
the humidity was in the high 60s or low (38:35 - 38:41)
70s the whole time yeah and like I wore (38:37 - 38:43)
a tank top and a shirt thinking it know (38:41 - 38:45)
it&#39;s supposed to be Breezy this morning (38:43 - 38:47)
it&#39;ll be fine and when I literally got (38:45 - 38:49)
to the fair I&#39;m like I can only wear at (38:47 - 38:53)
the tank top because it is already too (38:49 - 38:55)
hot (38:53 - 38:58)
um so comparing it to like the other (38:55 - 39:00)
to compare to compare to the other two (38:58 - 39:02)
go Fest I went to this year and we we (39:00 - 39:04)
did a bonus podcast where I talk about (39:02 - 39:06)
Madrid more in depth so if you&#39;re like a (39:04 - 39:07)
patreon subscriber or an apple podcast (39:06 - 39:09)
subscriber you can like listen to more (39:07 - 39:12)
in-depth thoughts of Madrid but I will (39:09 - 39:15)
say right now the Madrid Park was four (39:12 - 39:18)
times bigger than the New York Park and (39:15 - 39:23)
it was gorgeous like like easily like (39:18 - 39:24)
now that I&#39;ve been to I&#39;ve been to like (39:23 - 39:28)
13 go Fest I think (39:24 - 39:30)
because there&#39;s been like seven but I&#39;ve (39:28 - 39:32)
been to like multiple ones in the same (39:30 - 39:33)
year (39:32 - 39:37)
um the I can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called (39:33 - 39:42)
San Paulo Paulo something just a just an (39:37 - 39:45)
absolutely gorgeous Park from like in so (39:42 - 39:47)
much shade were there were there parts (39:45 - 39:50)
of that Park that didn&#39;t have shade 100% (39:47 - 39:52)
there was you know you know the like (39:50 - 39:54)
where you find small Liv for the first (39:52 - 39:57)
time mhm in scarlet and violet with like (39:54 - 40:00)
all those like little smaller trees like (39:57 - 40:02)
that existed in that park it there&#39;s a (40:00 - 40:04)
whole field of it and it was like so (40:02 - 40:08)
cool to be like I caught a small of here (40:04 - 40:12)
I also it was so (40:08 - 40:14)
hard because there was nothing to look (40:12 - 40:17)
at you couldn&#39;t really distract yourself (40:14 - 40:21)
much you&#39;re like big open Field scgly (40:17 - 40:23)
trees there&#39;s the food trucks and then (40:21 - 40:24)
you went to the north and I&#39;m like oh (40:23 - 40:27)
big open field I was grateful for (40:24 - 40:28)
everyone out was there with that was my (40:27 - 40:30)
distraction along with all of the tasks (40:28 - 40:32)
we were trying to complete within the (40:30 - 40:35)
designated time but there is no reason (40:32 - 40:37)
to stay on that island to look at (40:35 - 40:39)
anything if you completed your mission (40:37 - 40:42)
in the first hour just go what are you (40:39 - 40:45)
going to do there well they did have (40:42 - 40:48)
they did have some photo opportunity (40:45 - 40:50)
things I don&#39;t think I went over to a (40:48 - 40:52)
single one of them but the I tried to (40:50 - 40:55)
get anybody to go stand in the (40:52 - 40:58)
unbearable heat to a half hours to get a (40:55 - 41:01)
picture taken with a giant Pikachu and (40:58 - 41:03)
University said you can go stand out (41:01 - 41:05)
there and die if you want to we&#39;re not (41:03 - 41:08)
leaving still standby Friday morning is (41:05 - 41:10)
still the best time to play Oh 100% get (41:08 - 41:12)
it get it out of the way it was way (41:10 - 41:15)
easier to get pictures yeah although (41:12 - 41:18)
weatherwise I think Sunday morning (41:15 - 41:21)
actually won in the park this time (41:18 - 41:23)
because that was the day was somewhat (41:21 - 41:28)
cloudy yes Sunday was cloudy um but like (41:23 - 41:31)
they had the they had the the four (41:28 - 41:33)
biomes and each biome has like something (41:31 - 41:36)
to do like and when I mean something to (41:33 - 41:40)
do I just mean like stand here get a (41:36 - 41:42)
photo that&#39;s kind of it but like they&#39;re (41:40 - 41:44)
still cool like they&#39;re still cool (41:42 - 41:45)
experiences I don&#39;t think they should (41:44 - 41:48)
stop doing them I think they&#39;re really (41:45 - 41:50)
great uh this is the one thing that (41:48 - 41:53)
Japan has always done bad is like I (41:50 - 41:58)
don&#39;t know why but like um in Madrid (41:53 - 42:02)
there was this grassy cave like Forest (41:58 - 42:04)
thing that you walked into and it had (42:02 - 42:05)
these huge mushrooms and they had this (42:04 - 42:07)
like smoke machine it was like super (42:05 - 42:11)
super cool I like tone one of the slack (42:07 - 42:12)
uh supporters like took a picture of me (42:11 - 42:14)
and and I posted it it was just like (42:12 - 42:15)
super cool and they had something like (42:14 - 42:17)
this in New York which was like a rocky (42:15 - 42:20)
cave charg Stone like cave which had (42:17 - 42:22)
like air not air conditioning but it had (42:20 - 42:26)
like a huge fan inside it it felt 20° (42:22 - 42:28)
colder when you walk (42:26 - 42:33)
in but but there&#39;s a line to get in yes (42:28 - 42:35)
but on Friday we waited like less than (42:33 - 42:37)
three minutes to get in on Saturday you (42:35 - 42:40)
were waiting like a half hour to get in (42:37 - 42:46)
easily on that and then Madrid had water (42:40 - 42:48)
stations everywhere like probably like (42:46 - 42:50)
eight to 8 to 10 different water (42:48 - 42:52)
stations over the park now again the (42:50 - 42:56)
Madrid Park was much bigger and the New (42:52 - 42:58)
York had two water stations and each (42:56 - 43:02)
station had like 10 faucets but for (42:58 - 43:05)
whatever reason people were like like (43:02 - 43:08)
hogging three faucets or people didn&#39;t (43:05 - 43:10)
want it wasn&#39;t like intentionally hog (43:08 - 43:12)
water station didn&#39;t have very good (43:10 - 43:14)
water pressure from what I was hearing (43:12 - 43:16)
and seeing and so it would take like (43:14 - 43:18)
five minutes to fill up a single water (43:16 - 43:21)
bottle that seemed bad the northern (43:18 - 43:23)
water station was a totally different (43:21 - 43:25)
thing and if they had just had more of (43:23 - 43:27)
those if they had just had two or three (43:25 - 43:29)
more of those I think it would have been (43:27 - 43:31)
much better and I feel like that&#39;s such (43:29 - 43:34)
a simple solution to like I don&#39;t know (43:31 - 43:36)
where maybe maybe it&#39;s not maybe it&#39;s (43:34 - 43:38)
like we need a water line to hook up to (43:36 - 43:40)
and these are the only two water lines (43:38 - 43:42)
maybe but I don&#39;t think the southern one (43:40 - 43:43)
even had a water line cuz the northern (43:42 - 43:45)
one was up by a bathroom and so that&#39;s (43:43 - 43:47)
why they were I think able to have a big (43:45 - 43:49)
truck with good water pressure up there (43:47 - 43:51)
as far as I could tell at the southern (43:49 - 43:53)
water station it was just buckets of (43:51 - 43:55)
water that that their employees kept (43:53 - 43:58)
replacing throughout the day (43:55 - 43:59)
I don&#39;t know what madrids were they were (43:58 - 44:01)
they were they were like single use ones (43:59 - 44:02)
they the Madrid ones seem like the ones (44:01 - 44:05)
you see at the airport where you just (44:02 - 44:07)
like put your water bottle in and it it (44:05 - 44:09)
like Auto senses it and it drops down (44:07 - 44:12)
but they just had like these individual (44:09 - 44:15)
ones like scattered around the park and (44:12 - 44:17)
I went to the park on Friday and (44:15 - 44:19)
Saturday in Madrid and Ne none of them (44:17 - 44:22)
had lines ever they were just very (44:19 - 44:24)
accessible I don&#39;t know what the (44:22 - 44:26)
solution for that is Niantic I don&#39;t (44:24 - 44:28)
like you had a giant cement field I (44:26 - 44:30)
don&#39;t know bring in a giant truck and (44:28 - 44:32)
just park it there and then have faucets (44:30 - 44:35)
coming out of that like I think two (44:32 - 44:37)
extra one extra water station on each (44:35 - 44:40)
part of that Park so four total would (44:37 - 44:44)
have solved a lot of problems for sure I (44:40 - 44:46)
think the amount of food trucks they did (44:44 - 44:49)
was great uh New York had like triple (44:46 - 44:51)
the amount of food trucks that Madrid (44:49 - 44:52)
did I would say that&#39;s probably one of (44:51 - 44:55)
Madrid&#39;s for as big as that Park was (44:52 - 44:57)
they had like 10 food trucks where (44:55 - 45:00)
whereas New York had 10 food trucks on (44:57 - 45:02)
one side and then like another 20 on the (45:00 - 45:05)
other side um so I think I think they (45:02 - 45:07)
did a really great job with with food (45:05 - 45:09)
obviously you could get water (45:07 - 45:14)
there um both cell phone services at New (45:09 - 45:17)
York and Madrid felt fantastic I don&#39;t (45:14 - 45:19)
think I heard anyone having issues in (45:17 - 45:24)
the park itself yeah so they solved that (45:19 - 45:26)
I had a ton of issues and some of the (45:24 - 45:29)
people I were I was with um like my (45:26 - 45:31)
friend Julie who has lived in Japan for (45:29 - 45:34)
like 5 years she had issues in the the (45:31 - 45:36)
park in (45:34 - 45:39)
Sendai um and it wasn&#39;t like terrible it (45:36 - 45:41)
was just like oh we can&#39;t stand here (45:39 - 45:44)
it&#39;s a dead spot we need to like walk (45:41 - 45:47)
yeah I think two minutes this way to get (45:44 - 45:49)
out of it the problem with the Sal (45:47 - 45:53)
service also is it&#39;s really hard to (45:49 - 45:55)
determine how much of people&#39;s (45:53 - 45:57)
interference was the fact that it was so (45:55 - 46:00)
hot so the cell network and your phones (45:57 - 46:02)
were overheating and when they get to a (46:00 - 46:05)
certain temperature they just drop (46:02 - 46:07)
Network it just the N the towers don&#39;t (46:05 - 46:09)
work as well it&#39;s just everything is (46:07 - 46:11)
overheated and there&#39;s so many people (46:09 - 46:15)
but I think I didn&#39;t lose connection (46:11 - 46:20)
much as much as the heat was heating my (46:15 - 46:21)
phone up so much that it was doing (46:20 - 46:23)
anything it possibly could to try to (46:21 - 46:24)
conserve itself you need one of those (46:23 - 46:26)
little phone (46:24 - 46:29)
umbrellas Maybe (46:26 - 46:31)
don&#39;t think that would have helped I had (46:29 - 46:32)
to stop playing for a little bit too (46:31 - 46:34)
because my phone was stuck at 3% for (46:32 - 46:35)
maybe an (46:34 - 46:38)
hour fully charging it was plugged into (46:35 - 46:38)
a (46:38 - 46:42)
charger I will Char I I bought one of (46:38 - 46:45)
those phone coolers yeah the ones that (46:42 - 46:48)
Meg save to the back of your iPhone was (46:45 - 46:50)
like 40 bucks I had one before I had the (46:48 - 46:52)
Razer one and I didn&#39;t think it worked (46:50 - 46:55)
at all I brought that to Osaka last year (46:52 - 46:59)
which Osaka was4 15° if you remember me (46:55 - 47:01)
talking about that (46:59 - 47:04)
um and this new one I (47:01 - 47:07)
bought it worked like I never got I (47:04 - 47:10)
never got the heat warning um when I (47:07 - 47:12)
didn&#39;t use it I could like see my (47:10 - 47:16)
Graphics get Chunky on the device um and (47:12 - 47:18)
you can always tell where like your (47:16 - 47:20)
screen dims and you can&#39;t like make it (47:18 - 47:22)
brighter because it&#39;s so hot that it&#39;s (47:20 - 47:25)
default is to dim the (47:22 - 47:28)
screen I bought like the average one so (47:25 - 47:29)
I think I&#39;m going to return it and get (47:28 - 47:32)
like their super one which I think is (47:29 - 47:34)
like $20 more cuz I&#39;m (47:32 - 47:37)
actually I wasn&#39;t completely convinced (47:34 - 47:39)
but after the weekend I was like well (47:37 - 47:41)
everyone else was having slowdown and (47:39 - 47:44)
like charging issues so and I I was (47:41 - 47:48)
playing and streaming so I know my phone (47:44 - 47:51)
was like when you&#39;re screen recording (47:48 - 47:53)
your phone and then also uploading that (47:51 - 47:56)
to the internet constantly that&#39;s a lot (47:53 - 47:58)
more work than just just playing Pokémon (47:56 - 48:01)
go um and you just rip through battery (47:58 - 48:03)
so (48:01 - 48:04)
quick (48:03 - 48:08)
uh I the other thing I want to talk (48:04 - 48:11)
about is the the the city (48:08 - 48:14)
experience (48:11 - 48:17)
um I think the city experience for New (48:14 - 48:20)
York was great I think most people (48:17 - 48:22)
prefer the city experience if they&#39;ve (48:20 - 48:24)
been to several of these events and I (48:22 - 48:26)
think one of the reasons why the city (48:24 - 48:28)
experience was great was because the (48:26 - 48:32)
city was like 5° cooler than that Island (48:28 - 48:35)
was just cuz the buildings provided (48:32 - 48:37)
shade there was more trees it was way (48:35 - 48:40)
easier to hop into a 7-Eleven to get a (48:37 - 48:43)
water that was like $5 because it&#39;s New (48:40 - 48:44)
York yep (48:43 - 48:47)
but like the city experience was great (48:44 - 48:50)
yeah there was for some reason I (48:47 - 48:52)
couldn&#39;t see or people I was with (48:50 - 48:54)
couldn&#39;t see any official routes I swore (48:52 - 48:57)
they said there was going to be (48:54 - 49:01)
official routes but there wasn&#39;t (48:57 - 49:04)
any (49:01 - 49:07)
um so I didn&#39;t try any routes I did talk (49:04 - 49:09)
about in our Madrid episode that I (49:07 - 49:12)
really did genuinely enjoy the routes (49:09 - 49:14)
they made in Madrid especially as (49:12 - 49:15)
somebody who&#39;s never been to Madrid I&#39;ve (49:14 - 49:19)
been to New York 20 times like I kind of (49:15 - 49:21)
know what I&#39;ve seen like oh don&#39;t go (49:19 - 49:23)
down this street it leads to Time Square (49:21 - 49:28)
we don&#39;t want to go there um so (49:23 - 49:28)
the the things that like stood out to me (49:29 - 49:34)
was like Japan had this like Lapras (49:31 - 49:37)
experience that you could only get in (49:34 - 49:39)
Japan where you could meet Lapras they (49:37 - 49:41)
had the Lapras Cafe they had the Pokey (49:39 - 49:46)
lid and then Madrid had this like soccer (49:41 - 49:48)
footb experience that you could (49:46 - 49:51)
do and I don&#39;t think New York had any (49:48 - 49:54)
experience it was just there was some (49:51 - 49:59)
sports player who was there I (49:54 - 50:01)
think that&#39;s true you could beat that (49:59 - 50:04)
basketball player I (50:01 - 50:04)
guess they had the Google Play thing I (50:08 - 50:14)
they have the Google Play thing yeah y (50:11 - 50:17)
uh sure was but there was like nothing (50:14 - 50:20)
that really made that a little bit more (50:17 - 50:23)
unique or gave you a reason to really (50:20 - 50:26)
like stay or go to the island I guess I (50:23 - 50:29)
don&#39;t know that Island was like I I get (50:26 - 50:33)
why it&#39;s there it&#39;s it&#39;s away from (50:29 - 50:33)
everything Central Park I&#39;m sure is a (50:33 - 50:37)
nightmare to try to rent out or to do (50:35 - 50:39)
like oh yeah no I don&#39;t I can&#39;t even (50:37 - 50:42)
imagine how that would work I understand (50:39 - 50:44)
why it&#39;s there but when when I think of (50:42 - 50:49)
like 76 Expo the the the Madrid Park uh (50:44 - 50:51)
from what I heard of the London Park I (50:49 - 50:53)
can&#39;t remember which one that was just (50:51 - 50:54)
all the other Parks I&#39;ve been to Lincoln (50:53 - 50:57)
Park or the where the millennial Bean is (50:54 - 51:01)
in in Chicago just the rand&#39;s island (50:57 - 51:05)
is not not anything special it is is a (51:01 - 51:09)
park by definition and that is (51:05 - 51:09)
it yeah (51:10 - 51:15)
but the thing about the city experience (51:12 - 51:17)
and why I think it really works in these (51:15 - 51:23)
cities like Madrid or or Sendai or Osaka (51:17 - 51:28)
or um New York or Seattle (51:23 - 51:32)
was is is just the spawn density is so (51:28 - 51:35)
good you have all the Poké stops lit up (51:32 - 51:38)
you have your lur on you have your (51:35 - 51:39)
you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re rending with your (51:38 - 51:42)
palia and you&#39;re just getting so many (51:39 - 51:45)
spawns and you can kind of go wherever (51:42 - 51:47)
you want and I think that&#39;s what people (51:45 - 51:49)
really like I didn&#39;t bring this up in (51:47 - 51:53)
our Madrid episode but when I went to um (51:49 - 51:55)
like rrio rrio I don&#39;t remember what (51:53 - 51:57)
it&#39;s called it&#39;s like rrio Park in (51:55 - 52:00)
Madrid it&#39;s like it&#39;s like their version (51:57 - 52:02)
of Central Park it&#39;s like this huge (52:00 - 52:05)
gorgeous Park like makes sense why it&#39;s (52:02 - 52:07)
not why like go Fest wouldn&#39;t be there (52:05 - 52:10)
um because there&#39;s just too many little (52:07 - 52:13)
things and like narrow paths and (52:10 - 52:17)
stuff and when I was there I had like (52:13 - 52:20)
cell phone issues my my stream backpack (52:17 - 52:22)
has two different SIM (52:20 - 52:24)
cards the two phones I use one to read (52:22 - 52:26)
chat and then one to play Pokémon go (52:24 - 52:27)
each of those have two different SIM (52:26 - 52:29)
cards so I&#39;m like walking through this (52:27 - 52:32)
park with like six different SIM cards (52:29 - 52:33)
and they&#39;re all having issues like I&#39;m (52:32 - 52:35)
switching I&#39;m like ah let&#39;s try movie (52:33 - 52:37)
star let&#39;s switch over to vone let&#39;s try (52:35 - 52:38)
5G let&#39;s try (52:37 - 52:41)
LTE and I&#39;m like I didn&#39;t have any (52:38 - 52:43)
issues when I played in normal the (52:41 - 52:45)
normal City I didn&#39;t have any issues in (52:43 - 52:48)
the park but in this park I had a ton of (52:45 - 52:50)
issues and it was also frustrating (52:48 - 52:53)
because um people were like oh this park (52:50 - 52:55)
is great we do community days here this (52:53 - 52:57)
park is wonderful (52:55 - 53:00)
and the spawn density I felt in that (52:57 - 53:04)
Park just wasn&#39;t good um and it felt (53:00 - 53:09)
like if I didn&#39;t have palia going it (53:04 - 53:12)
just wouldn&#39;t be worth it to be there (53:09 - 53:13)
now that being said like all those stops (53:12 - 53:15)
were lured up like everything like it (53:13 - 53:17)
was there were definitely people playing (53:15 - 53:20)
and doing raids but as soon as I I (53:17 - 53:22)
jumped back into the City and went to (53:20 - 53:25)
like Central Madrid just like everything (53:22 - 53:26)
feels better there&#39;s just so many more (53:25 - 53:29)
spawns there&#39;s so many more people (53:26 - 53:32)
like easier to jump into buildings to (53:29 - 53:35)
like get shade and stuff and I think the (53:32 - 53:37)
same I felt the same way about Central (53:35 - 53:41)
Park 100% And Shout out to we had over a (53:37 - 53:43)
hundred people show up at the Apple (53:41 - 53:45)
Store and not all 100 people went into (53:43 - 53:46)
the park with us a lot of people said hi (53:45 - 53:49)
and like they had to run but we ended up (53:46 - 53:51)
getting a picture of like 83 people or (53:49 - 53:54)
something um in inside Central Park (53:51 - 53:56)
before people started like also leaving (53:54 - 53:58)
you know why some people started leaving (53:56 - 54:00)
and this is no shade to them 100% (53:58 - 54:02)
understood is because the spawn density (54:00 - 54:05)
sucked in Central Park not just (54:02 - 54:08)
that not just that some people straight (54:05 - 54:10)
up was like I want a shiny hunt and (54:08 - 54:12)
there&#39;s just not enough spawns here and (54:10 - 54:17)
it felt ex exactly like rrio Park and (54:12 - 54:19)
I like I understand how Pokemon go works (54:17 - 54:20)
if it&#39;s based off like cell phone (54:19 - 54:23)
traffic but if you have the option of (54:20 - 54:27)
being in Central Park or deeper in the (54:23 - 54:28)
city and you only care about getting as (54:27 - 54:30)
much shinies as possible Central Park is (54:28 - 54:32)
not the play now we had to be in Central (54:30 - 54:35)
Park because we had 80 people following (54:32 - 54:37)
us and trying to cross traffic with 80 (54:35 - 54:40)
people very (54:37 - 54:43)
hard so as like a casual (54:40 - 54:49)
experience it was really great um (54:43 - 54:49)
but um but yeah I it&#39;s Central Park was (54:50 - 54:56)
recommended by Niantic as a place to (54:54 - 54:57)
play and I&#39;m glad glad we played there I (54:56 - 54:59)
have no regrets of going but I totally (54:57 - 55:01)
understood why people were (54:59 - 55:03)
like I caught everything here I think (55:01 - 55:05)
that&#39;s like the thing you think of is (55:03 - 55:07)
like okay we stopped here for a raid and (55:05 - 55:09)
I caught everything here and we&#39;re (55:07 - 55:11)
waiting for people to finish before you (55:09 - 55:14)
move but there&#39;s nothing to do because (55:11 - 55:16)
the spawns aren&#39;t there whereas when (55:14 - 55:18)
you&#39;re in the park of goest or when (55:16 - 55:21)
you&#39;re downtown New York or when Greg (55:18 - 55:24)
and I are at Mall of America when you (55:21 - 55:27)
stop there&#39;s too much yeah there&#39;s too (55:24 - 55:30)
much and you just you just can&#39;t catch (55:27 - 55:31)
everything cuz by the time you&#39;re done (55:30 - 55:34)
more things are spawning in especially (55:31 - 55:35)
if you have palia (55:34 - 55:37)
running yeah I think that was definitely (55:35 - 55:40)
a big element of it with Central Park (55:37 - 55:43)
but also there were just too many people (55:40 - 55:46)
in the park playing to the point where (55:43 - 55:48)
that was where we were creating dead (55:46 - 55:51)
zones we had fine signal in the actual (55:48 - 55:53)
park for the event on Randall&#39;s Island (55:51 - 55:55)
but in Central Park almost everybody (55:53 - 55:57)
lost signal (55:55 - 55:58)
at some (55:57 - 56:02)
point yeah similar to that Park isn&#39;t (55:58 - 56:05)
isn&#39;t great and there&#39;s a lot that can (56:02 - 56:08)
be said about the fact (56:05 - 56:08)
that there are a lot of regulations and (56:08 - 56:15)
a lot of things that go on uh to make it (56:11 - 56:18)
sure that Central Park has okay but not (56:15 - 56:22)
great service for a lot of reasons so (56:18 - 56:23)
the fact that there are so many people (56:22 - 56:26)
there also it&#39;s a large National Park (56:23 - 56:28)
that (56:26 - 56:32)
Towers can&#39;t really go inside so you&#39;re (56:28 - 56:35)
kind of relying on the periphery a lot (56:32 - 56:38)
uh amongst other (56:35 - 56:41)
considerations uh it&#39;s not an ideal (56:38 - 56:45)
place to to be and at that point on (56:41 - 56:47)
Sunday after trying to play I was like (56:45 - 56:50)
my phone is dead I don&#39;t even have a (56:47 - 56:52)
ticket for this day I just want to be (56:50 - 56:54)
here talking to the 80 people that are (56:52 - 56:56)
here I just put my phone away and I was (56:54 - 56:58)
done which was you know yeah which was (56:56 - 57:00)
totally cool like like to anyone that (56:58 - 57:02)
was like I can&#39;t stick around it&#39;s too (57:00 - 57:05)
hot I my phone&#39;s dead I I I don&#39;t want (57:02 - 57:08)
to do R like I totally understand and I (57:05 - 57:10)
like I&#39;m not making anyone feel bad I&#39;m (57:08 - 57:12)
just giving the experience that Central (57:10 - 57:16)
Park was not great spawn wise and not (57:12 - 57:20)
great reception wise yeah um because (57:16 - 57:22)
almost everyone in our group when we got (57:20 - 57:25)
to that very Center Park of Central Park (57:22 - 57:28)
there was like seven raids there and no (57:25 - 57:30)
one could get reception yeah and it (57:28 - 57:32)
wasn&#39;t until we started moving back away (57:30 - 57:34)
from the center where people were like (57:32 - 57:36)
okay reception&#39;s coming back I can get (57:34 - 57:39)
the game is starting to work again like (57:36 - 57:41)
Cody said it was fantastic Vibes with (57:39 - 57:43)
our group everyone was great we were all (57:41 - 57:45)
having a lot of fun with each other but (57:43 - 57:48)
also the game was not (57:45 - 57:51)
working so (57:48 - 57:54)
um I don&#39;t know if there was any I again (57:51 - 57:57)
that&#39;s why I compared the Madrid Central (57:54 - 57:59)
Park I can&#39;t and then New York Central (57:57 - 58:00)
Park to similar because I&#39;m assuming (57:59 - 58:03)
they have similar zoning things of like (58:00 - 58:05)
we can&#39;t just put a tower straight in (58:03 - 58:08)
the middle of this park right and so the (58:05 - 58:11)
deeper into that Park you get you you&#39;re (58:08 - 58:13)
just On The Fringe of cell phone network (58:11 - 58:15)
right we weren&#39;t even that deep into the (58:13 - 58:18)
park we were just in the middle of the (58:15 - 58:21)
yeah but when you (58:18 - 58:24)
have when you have normal traffic it&#39;s (58:21 - 58:26)
fine when you have super heavy traffic (58:24 - 58:28)
traffic it is not going to be fine when (58:26 - 58:30)
you have two massive raid trains passing (58:28 - 58:33)
each other in one specific part of the (58:30 - 58:37)
park everything goes down yeah and and (58:33 - 58:40)
the I&#39;m sure there are some very intense (58:37 - 58:43)
raid trains that happen at these events (58:40 - 58:45)
uh the raid train that I put on was was (58:43 - 58:48)
not intense at all that was very that (58:45 - 58:51)
was very purposeful like we&#39;re all (58:48 - 58:53)
exhausted on day three the park is at (58:51 - 58:54)
least (58:53 - 58:58)
shaded like easy sh there was cloud (58:54 - 59:01)
cover everyone just wanted to hang out (58:58 - 59:04)
and make sure everyone was hydrated (59:01 - 59:04)
enough (59:05 - 59:12)
but it was a good go Fest it was great (59:07 - 59:14)
I&#39;m very curious if Niantic signed a (59:12 - 59:17)
three-year deal with randle&#39;s Park and (59:14 - 59:19)
we&#39;re going to get randle&#39;s park again (59:17 - 59:22)
which a lot of people seem to think so (59:19 - 59:25)
yeah um which may maybe that (59:22 - 59:27)
construction will be finished (59:25 - 59:30)
but like I don&#39;t Noe no but like if (59:27 - 59:32)
they&#39;re going to do rand&#39;s Park a third (59:30 - 59:35)
time which is fine cuz like I think the (59:32 - 59:38)
space itself is (59:35 - 59:40)
fine but they but if they were to up the (59:38 - 59:44)
amount of tents up the amount of water (59:40 - 59:47)
stations maybe add like one or two more (59:44 - 59:49)
things to make it a little bit more (59:47 - 59:52)
unique that would also have shade in (59:49 - 59:53)
some (59:52 - 59:56)
way because I I I think when like you (59:53 - 60:00)
have something so hot which they can&#39;t (59:56 - 60:03)
control even if it was like super hot or (60:00 - 60:06)
super rainy if there were just more tent (60:03 - 60:07)
opportunities people would be like you (60:06 - 60:09)
know what let&#39;s take a let&#39;s take a (60:07 - 60:12)
20-minute break and meet Pikachu cuz (60:09 - 60:16)
like that area is shaded and that&#39;s fine (60:12 - 60:20)
I I think they&#39;re so close to (60:16 - 60:20)
like the park doesn&#39;t matter as much as (60:21 - 60:27)
the space does (60:24 - 60:30)
um that at least in that instance of New (60:27 - 60:32)
York they could just add a couple more (60:30 - 60:34)
things to make it a little bit better (60:32 - 60:37)
like do something with that cement like (60:34 - 60:40)
bring in like a water truck or something (60:37 - 60:42)
and have people line up the also the (60:40 - 60:43)
like side note the one thing that drove (60:42 - 60:47)
me crazy is they put the battles in (60:43 - 60:50)
direct sunlight like I understand why (60:47 - 60:54)
the why the trading booth (60:50 - 60:57)
area is in direct sunlight cuz because (60:54 - 60:58)
the they don&#39;t want people to go to the (60:57 - 61:01)
trading Booth sit down in the shade and (60:58 - 61:03)
just stay there because they&#39;re not (61:01 - 61:06)
trading they want people to get in trade (61:03 - 61:09)
and get out to keep that movement going (61:06 - 61:10)
so I understand why it&#39;s in the sun even (61:09 - 61:13)
though like it&#39;s slightly cruel but I I (61:10 - 61:16)
like get it if you&#39;re going to have if (61:13 - 61:17)
you&#39;re going to be like hey do you guys (61:16 - 61:19)
want to go battle like we you&#39;ll get a (61:17 - 61:21)
little reward when you&#39;re done no I do (61:19 - 61:24)
not want to stand in direct sunlight and (61:21 - 61:26)
battle somebody I just don&#39;t like if if (61:24 - 61:30)
if that was shaded like it was in Madrid (61:26 - 61:33)
it was in a like huge shaded gazebo I (61:30 - 61:34)
would been like you know what Greg you (61:33 - 61:36)
want to battle for 10 (61:34 - 61:38)
minutes we will be in the shade and I (61:36 - 61:40)
guarantee you Greg would have been like (61:38 - 61:42)
yes let&#39;s do that let&#39;s do that how how (61:40 - 61:46)
long can we make this last like how slow (61:42 - 61:48)
can we do this battle do I have to tap (61:46 - 61:51)
for us to be here for four (61:48 - 61:53)
hours um so there was just like some (61:51 - 61:57)
really like odd decisions but um (61:53 - 61:59)
as you can tell out of all three go (61:57 - 62:02)
fests neither were like really (61:59 - 62:06)
perfect but um they&#39;re learning (62:02 - 62:08)
though small things are being improved (62:06 - 62:11)
not everything but this year on the (62:08 - 62:13)
island was better than last year on the (62:11 - 62:15)
island in some ways except for the (62:13 - 62:18)
weather which they couldn&#39;t control (62:15 - 62:19)
though they probably could have planned (62:18 - 62:23)
better for it game technically at all (62:19 - 62:26)
three go Fest worked great like as (62:23 - 62:28)
somebody who went to all three the tech (62:26 - 62:30)
support booth at all three had almost no (62:28 - 62:33)
one in it at all times I&#39;m not saying (62:30 - 62:35)
there weren&#39;t people with tech issues (62:33 - 62:36)
because of you know people might be (62:35 - 62:38)
using older phones or whatnot or maybe (62:36 - 62:40)
forgot to download assets or whatever (62:38 - 62:42)
there&#39;s tons of issues that can go wrong (62:40 - 62:46)
but like the game technically (62:42 - 62:49)
worked um really well so I think they&#39;ve (62:46 - 62:52)
figured that out and at least on (62:49 - 62:54)
Randall&#39;s Island and in Madrid they have (62:52 - 62:56)
figured out the right amount of of cows (62:54 - 62:59)
and where to put them so at least if (62:56 - 63:01)
they are going back to randa&#39;s (62:59 - 63:04)
Island the cell phone situation should (63:01 - 63:06)
not (63:04 - 63:08)
get right like they they figured it out (63:06 - 63:11)
put them in the same (63:08 - 63:11)
spots (63:11 - 63:17)
um yeah it&#39;s just it&#39;s just an ugly park (63:14 - 63:20)
though see that was my only experience (63:17 - 63:22)
with a go fest last year and this year (63:20 - 63:25)
both on Randall&#39;s Island so I hadn&#39;t had (63:22 - 63:28)
anything to compare it to now I want (63:25 - 63:29)
even more for it to come back to the (63:28 - 63:31)
Pacific Northwest and be in Seattle (63:29 - 63:33)
again because I heard that was a great (63:31 - 63:35)
Park that everyone enjoyed and it&#39;s (63:33 - 63:38)
nearby for me the problem with that the (63:35 - 63:40)
problem with the Seattle one was the (63:38 - 63:42)
line for the Pokemon Center like you you (63:40 - 63:44)
were spending all four hours in that (63:42 - 63:46)
line if you wanted yeah that&#39;s how it (63:44 - 63:47)
was on Randall&#39;s Island too I don&#39;t know (63:46 - 63:49)
if you even tried to go in there but (63:47 - 63:51)
last year I had to go on a totally (63:49 - 63:53)
different day to even get in because if (63:51 - 63:55)
I was trying to go during the hours that (63:53 - 63:57)
I was supposed to be playing I would not (63:55 - 64:00)
finish all of the research the shirt (63:57 - 64:02)
pickup thing that they switched over to (64:00 - 64:05)
yes two or three years ago was good the (64:02 - 64:06)
pickup works well where you just show (64:05 - 64:09)
your QR code and you take it worked (64:06 - 64:11)
great um I think the fairy thing is (64:09 - 64:14)
absolutely fantastic I think that like (64:11 - 64:16)
what a it was it was even it was just a (64:14 - 64:18)
cool way to get to go Fest (64:16 - 64:20)
yeah it was a cool way to get go it was (64:18 - 64:23)
a go way to leave go Fest cuz we waited (64:20 - 64:25)
15 minutes run a ferry and went back (64:23 - 64:27)
yeah (64:25 - 64:29)
just a that&#39;s a really really cool (64:27 - 64:32)
experience I I was I was told I heard (64:29 - 64:33)
that the buses were a little messy on (64:32 - 64:36)
the first day like they seemed really (64:33 - 64:39)
crowded yeah oh messy with people or (64:36 - 64:42)
messy because it&#39;s just New York messy (64:39 - 64:44)
cuz New York has got a bit of a mess (64:42 - 64:46)
problem you know I wasn&#39;t when they said (64:44 - 64:49)
it was messy I I didn&#39;t ask it was like (64:46 - 64:51)
it was it the passenger&#39;s fault or was (64:49 - 64:53)
it the driver&#39;s fault were they messy (64:51 - 64:57)
people or messy Environ (64:53 - 65:01)
uh un unsure on that (64:57 - 65:04)
um I I I think these events are 100% (65:01 - 65:08)
worth traveling to for sure um (65:04 - 65:10)
especially if you have a community if (65:08 - 65:12)
you have a community or there&#39;s a group (65:10 - 65:15)
that you&#39;re going to go with they are (65:12 - 65:19)
100% worth traveling for if you&#39;re going (65:15 - 65:23)
by yourself and you don&#39;t know (65:19 - 65:23)
anybody it&#39;s a whole different (65:23 - 65:26)
experience and (65:25 - 65:28)
at that point you have to decide what (65:26 - 65:31)
that means to you yeah (65:28 - 65:34)
like it&#39;s a lot of money it&#39;s a lot of (65:31 - 65:37)
money for a weekend well there&#39;s a lot (65:34 - 65:38)
of people that go to concerts by (65:37 - 65:41)
themselves and ideally they they meet (65:38 - 65:46)
people thre day City Event I think I (65:41 - 65:49)
think like EDC is like two (65:46 - 65:53)
days you could headbang in Vegas yeah (65:49 - 65:56)
but H I don&#39;t know at the these events (65:53 - 65:58)
you&#39;re very in yourr phone when you&#39;re (65:56 - 66:00)
on the island you&#39;re very focused (65:58 - 66:02)
especially this year when you were (66:00 - 66:04)
really just trying to finish so that you (66:02 - 66:06)
could not be in the sun (66:04 - 66:11)
anymore and so I you can meet new people (66:06 - 66:13)
but I don&#39;t know maybe I was just so (66:11 - 66:16)
satisfied with our group of fantastic (66:13 - 66:19)
community members that I didn&#39;t even try (66:16 - 66:21)
I talked to some cool people on the (66:19 - 66:22)
subway they were they were debating (66:21 - 66:24)
about what&#39;s a lucky trade and and they (66:22 - 66:26)
were like I don&#39;t know if rma&#39;s worth (66:24 - 66:28)
the lucky trade and I like I turned to (66:26 - 66:29)
them and I was like you&#39;re out of your (66:28 - 66:31)
mind you should if you both got shiny (66:29 - 66:33)
neosa and you&#39;re lucky yes you should (66:31 - 66:36)
trade those and they&#39;re like all right (66:33 - 66:38)
dude they were they were really cool (66:36 - 66:41)
guys actually (66:38 - 66:44)
um yeah it was it was (66:41 - 66:46)
uh it was a good experience in New York (66:44 - 66:51)
minus the heat but yeah (66:46 - 66:55)
um yeah I don&#39;t I I&#39;m surprised only (66:51 - 66:57)
Saturday sold that (66:55 - 66:59)
when you look at Japan it was it was 4th (66:57 - 67:01)
of July weekend yeah it was a bad (66:59 - 67:03)
weekend having it over I thought that (67:01 - 67:05)
was a good okay real talk it was a great (67:03 - 67:09)
weekend I took an Uber from the airport (67:05 - 67:13)
to my hotel only because it said 15 (67:09 - 67:15)
minutes and it was only like $30 which (67:13 - 67:17)
is one the cheapest Uber I&#39;ve ever taken (67:15 - 67:20)
in New York two the fastest Uber I&#39;ve (67:17 - 67:21)
ever taken in New York you know why cuz (67:20 - 67:23)
there was no traffic on Fourth of July (67:21 - 67:26)
we got to our hotel so quickly and so (67:23 - 67:28)
cheap that I was like this is (67:26 - 67:30)
mindblowing yeah no one&#39;s traveling (67:28 - 67:32)
today leaving after the event was a (67:30 - 67:34)
little (67:32 - 67:36)
much were definitely people traveling on (67:34 - 67:41)
that day the Uber out was not (67:36 - 67:44)
$30 what was your (67:41 - 67:47)
price was your price when you looked (67:44 - 67:50)
75 oh that was (67:47 - 67:55)
uh I was leaving at 11: and I opened up (67:50 - 67:56)
my lift (67:55 - 68:01)
to get an Uber to get a lift and it was (67:56 - 68:06)
$350 what on Monday morning yep did you (68:01 - 68:08)
go to L (68:06 - 68:12)
huh uh LaGuardia (68:08 - 68:14)
yeah I I ordered mine the night before (68:12 - 68:17)
maybe that why it was (68:14 - 68:17)
cheaper possibly uh I didn&#39;t take (68:17 - 68:25)
it because when you have lifted Uber but (68:21 - 68:27)
also you have a very (68:25 - 68:30)
extensive network of taxi cabs that know (68:27 - 68:33)
how to get around I just got a taxi did (68:30 - 68:36)
the taxi card (68:33 - 68:36)
$40 where the the taxis take card right (68:37 - 68:42)
yeah you can do it on the app you can (68:40 - 68:45)
prepay I prepaid on the app I&#39;d like a (68:42 - 68:47)
taxi app yeah oh I didn&#39;t know that was (68:45 - 68:50)
yeah all the taxis have apps like they (68:47 - 68:52)
have iil here they have Curb there like (68:50 - 68:54)
if you can just take you can also go to (68:52 - 68:56)
your front desk and say I need a taxi (68:54 - 68:59)
and they&#39;re like okay and in the taxi if (68:56 - 69:01)
you didn&#39;t pay online they have the card (68:59 - 69:03)
reader right there attached right in (69:01 - 69:05)
front of you yeah I&#39;m like I&#39;ll take (69:03 - 69:08)
that the the thing (69:05 - 69:13)
though taxi drivers are wild drivers I (69:08 - 69:16)
have I forget how fast they have no fear (69:13 - 69:19)
this is their job it&#39;s like being at (69:16 - 69:20)
NASCAR I was just like I&#39;m going to be (69:19 - 69:23)
sick we&#39;re moving so fast and weaving in (69:20 - 69:25)
and out of traffic I&#39;m like I&#39;m not any (69:23 - 69:27)
way shap perform late for my flight but (69:25 - 69:30)
that was not a deterrent it was just 90 (69:27 - 69:33)
if if I was by myself I would have just (69:30 - 69:35)
taken the Subway or if I was going to (69:33 - 69:37)
JFK I would have just taken the Subway (69:35 - 69:39)
because the there is no Subway to (69:37 - 69:42)
LaGuardia it&#39;s like Subway and then bus (69:39 - 69:44)
but I was I was with somebody (69:42 - 69:47)
so um who is who is not a very good (69:44 - 69:50)
Subway taker uh so it&#39;s like it&#39;s fine (69:47 - 69:52)
we&#39;ll just we&#39;ll just we&#39;ll just Dober (69:50 - 69:53)
it&#39;s (69:52 - 69:57)
okay it&#39;s it&#39;s not terribly expensive (69:53 - 69:58)
it is what I expected for New (69:57 - 70:01)
York all right uh let&#39;s take our one (69:58 - 70:03)
last break and then there&#39;s a bunch of (70:01 - 70:05)
scarlet and violet news so we will be (70:03 - 70:09)
right back and we are back from our (70:05 - 70:15)
break they uh they did the thing and (70:09 - 70:18)
gave us a whole calendar event of (70:15 - 70:21)
Pokemon things to do in scarlet and (70:18 - 70:24)
violet specifically (70:21 - 70:27)
yes specifically in (70:24 - 70:29)
this which I feel like they should do (70:27 - 70:33)
more often um they said uh this is this (70:29 - 70:34)
is off the Pokemon&#39;s website special (70:33 - 70:36)
Terra Raid event battles and mass op (70:34 - 70:40)
ranks coming in four seasonal events so (70:36 - 70:42)
uh they broke him down into different (70:40 - 70:45)
parts uh part one will be search for (70:42 - 70:46)
Pikachu and Friends Pikachu with the (70:45 - 70:48)
mightiest Mark will be making its return (70:46 - 70:51)
to sevenstar raids uh Pikachu will (70:48 - 70:53)
appear with the water terot type if (70:51 - 70:54)
you&#39;ve caught the special Pikachu you (70:53 - 70:56)
cannot catch it again (70:54 - 70:58)
I believe that like Pikachu had like a (70:56 - 71:01)
one in six chance of being jumbo the (70:58 - 71:05)
first time it came around um but if you (71:01 - 71:06)
already caught it can&#39;t catch it again (71:05 - 71:09)
so if you were look if assuming it is (71:06 - 71:11)
going to be exactly the same same move (71:09 - 71:13)
set same nature same everything should (71:11 - 71:15)
still be jumbo um you&#39;re going to have (71:13 - 71:17)
to use your other copy whether that&#39;s (71:15 - 71:18)
Scarlet or Violet um you have to turn (71:17 - 71:19)
off (71:18 - 71:24)
autosave catch it check to see the size (71:19 - 71:27)
if it&#39;s not re set H do it (71:24 - 71:30)
again so (71:27 - 71:33)
um I have raide counters up on on (71:30 - 71:36)
YouTube with with Pokemon that can can (71:33 - 71:39)
that can do that uh also during this (71:36 - 71:41)
event uh look for mass outbreaks with (71:39 - 71:43)
Pichu throughout Pala masse outbreaks (71:41 - 71:45)
Pikachu and mimiku will be in kakami (71:43 - 71:48)
masse outbreaks of Raichu and alolan (71:45 - 71:50)
Raichu will be in the blueberry Academy (71:48 - 71:52)
alolan Raichu cannot be normally (71:50 - 71:54)
encountered during regular gameplay and (71:52 - 71:56)
Shiny Pokemon are more likely to appear (71:54 - 71:58)
in the special mass outbreak and this (71:56 - 72:02)
will run from Friday June 12th UTC time (71:58 - 72:05)
which is Thursday at like 7 p.m. central (72:02 - 72:09)
Time um through Thursday July 25th till (72:05 - 72:13)
midnight UTC time so you have a twow (72:09 - 72:16)
week event with seven star Pikachu and (72:13 - 72:19)
two weeks of Pikachu Pichu mimikyu (72:16 - 72:23)
Raichu and a lolan Raichu for mass (72:19 - 72:26)
outbreaks which (72:23 - 72:29)
pretty pretty good on its own (72:26 - 72:30)
honestly if you&#39;re looking for any of (72:29 - 72:34)
those shinies especially (72:30 - 72:34)
MH I think that (72:35 - 72:38)
like obviously intentional since they (72:39 - 72:45)
cut the Pokedex and that was intentional (72:42 - 72:49)
but I think making like hisian Pokemon (72:45 - 72:53)
or alolan Pokemon like spawn not (72:49 - 72:56)
naturally in the game for an event (72:53 - 72:58)
is like really exciting like the amount (72:56 - 73:01)
of people I&#39;ve seen just over the moon (72:58 - 73:04)
excited that alolan Raichu will be (73:01 - 73:06)
surfing around in the wild is like (73:04 - 73:08)
really (73:06 - 73:11)
cool and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a cool Pokemon yeah (73:08 - 73:13)
I think it&#39;ll be worth at least opening (73:11 - 73:15)
the game and connecting to the internet (73:13 - 73:17)
even just to see (73:15 - 73:19)
that to see where they end up being run (73:17 - 73:21)
into a couple in the wild even if you&#39;re (73:19 - 73:23)
not looking for a (73:21 - 73:25)
shiny yeah I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s the same (73:23 - 73:28)
same boosted shiny odds (73:25 - 73:30)
as past mass outbreaks I can&#39;t imagine (73:28 - 73:32)
they&#39;re going to be different cool that (73:30 - 73:35)
it came back so Charizard came back it (73:32 - 73:37)
was exactly the same Charizard Pikachu (73:35 - 73:40)
coming back I would assume that we would (73:37 - 73:42)
see other sevenstar raid bosses (73:40 - 73:43)
eventually come (73:42 - 73:46)
back uh but there will be a new (73:43 - 73:49)
sevenstar raid boss for part (73:46 - 73:51)
two this will take place as soon as the (73:49 - 73:54)
Pikachu event is over so from Friday (73:51 - 73:59)
July 2 6 to Thursday July or August 8th (73:54 - 74:02)
we go back in time um it&#39;s reversing (73:59 - 74:05)
time dond dozo with the mightiest Mark (74:02 - 74:07)
will appear in sevenstar raids it will (74:05 - 74:09)
be the water Terra type so that&#39;s (74:07 - 74:12)
confirmed during this event uh they will (74:09 - 74:15)
have mass outbreaks of curly form taguri (74:12 - 74:20)
in Pala uh droopy form taguri in kakami (74:15 - 74:23)
and mass outbreaks of stretchy form (74:20 - 74:25)
taguri in the blueberry Academy shiny po (74:23 - 74:27)
are more likely to (74:25 - 74:30)
appear um I never know which form is (74:27 - 74:31)
what (74:30 - 74:34)
color now you only have to like once you (74:31 - 74:35)
figure it out though you&#39;re like okay I (74:34 - 74:39)
got the kakami one I can move on to (74:35 - 74:41)
Pala very (74:39 - 74:43)
straightforward I think again this is (74:41 - 74:47)
such a good thematic event like you put (74:43 - 74:49)
Don dozo in Seven Stars Then you put (74:47 - 74:51)
tses and outbreaks for two we like two (74:49 - 74:56)
what a cool event it&#39;s it&#39;s a cute idea (74:51 - 75:00)
D dozo is already a six-star (74:56 - 75:00)
nightmare (75:00 - 75:05)
yeah like that raid can start off so (75:02 - 75:07)
well and then as like soon as like rain (75:05 - 75:09)
dance goes up and then you&#39;re hit with a (75:07 - 75:11)
yawn and then he wave crashes you you&#39;re (75:09 - 75:14)
like oh we&#39;re we&#39;re we lost like we (75:11 - 75:15)
messed this (75:14 - 75:18)
up (75:15 - 75:18)
um exciting though I I love Seven Star (75:18 - 75:24)
raids so um I&#39;ll probably start building (75:21 - 75:26)
for that probably after this weekend cuz (75:24 - 75:28)
I probably won&#39;t have to grind out (75:26 - 75:30)
Pikachu that long um but I think off the (75:28 - 75:32)
top of my head zaren would be really (75:30 - 75:35)
good for dondoo because Arena&#39;s trop (75:32 - 75:37)
kick would lower dond Doo&#39;s attack and (75:35 - 75:39)
dondoo is a physical attacker um plus (75:37 - 75:42)
the grass (75:39 - 75:45)
resistance but I I this is (75:42 - 75:47)
like I have all the Pikachus to shiny (75:45 - 75:50)
but I I only have one tasa shiny so that (75:47 - 75:52)
like I&#39;m definitely shiny hunting this (75:50 - 75:55)
event for sure (75:52 - 75:55)
uh part three is celebrate the World (75:56 - 76:01)
Championships uh chest form gimy ghoul (75:58 - 76:03)
will appear in one 125 star raid battles (76:01 - 76:04)
these chess forms will have various (76:03 - 76:06)
terot types if you challenge one in a (76:04 - 76:08)
five star you&#39;ll have a small chance of (76:06 - 76:10)
encountering the shiny chess form gim me (76:08 - 76:11)
goal which doesn&#39;t appear during normal (76:10 - 76:13)
gameplay during this event mass (76:11 - 76:16)
outbreaks of wol through (76:13 - 76:19)
Pala uh Riolu through kitakami and com (76:16 - 76:21)
through blueberry Academy Shiny Pokemon (76:19 - 76:24)
are more likely to appear uh also (76:21 - 76:26)
Pokemon appearing and special outbreaks (76:24 - 76:28)
will more likely have the Pumped up Mark (76:26 - 76:30)
so this is the first time they&#39;ve done (76:28 - 76:33)
that both shiny and Mark increase at the (76:30 - 76:35)
same time this the first time they&#39;re (76:33 - 76:38)
ever doing that they did go out and say (76:35 - 76:39)
you will have a small chance of (76:38 - 76:42)
encountering chest form gim goul the (76:39 - 76:44)
odds last time were one in (76:42 - 76:46)
4,000 (76:44 - 76:48)
yeah it was real (76:46 - 76:52)
bad I I think when they say small chance (76:48 - 76:54)
it means it will still be one it still (76:52 - 76:57)
be the small (76:54 - 76:59)
chance which is a shame CU that&#39;s one (76:57 - 77:01)
people are really excited (76:59 - 77:03)
about there (77:01 - 77:07)
is there here how can I word this there (77:03 - 77:11)
has always been a hacked raid problem in (77:07 - 77:14)
Pokemon games since sword and shield (77:11 - 77:18)
where you know zashi and.net or (77:14 - 77:22)
machamps.com or Gengar Dogo they&#39;re (77:18 - 77:27)
putting their sh hacked raids up on it (77:22 - 77:29)
and for the most part if you do them and (77:27 - 77:31)
you catch them like nothing bad happens (77:29 - 77:33)
it&#39;s just they manipulated it for that (77:31 - 77:37)
to happen and I think that more players (77:33 - 77:39)
that are playing currently are seeing (77:37 - 77:42)
more of those raids not because there (77:39 - 77:43)
are (77:42 - 77:46)
more hackers out there I think people (77:43 - 77:48)
are just seeing those raids more often (77:46 - 77:51)
because there are just less normal (77:48 - 77:56)
players playing yeah I redid I started (77:51 - 77:58)
Scarlet for (77:56 - 78:00)
reasons and I was in the process of (77:58 - 78:04)
trying to unlock six-star raids and I (78:00 - 78:07)
got I&#39;m like this is hacking because I (78:04 - 78:12)
got two shiny raids backto back yeah (78:07 - 78:14)
yeah and I was (78:12 - 78:17)
like I mean I&#39;ll take it because the (78:14 - 78:18)
game doesn&#39;t care you&#39;re not the one who (78:17 - 78:22)
yeah but also come on (78:18 - 78:26)
like backto back back to back buy a (78:22 - 78:29)
lottery ticket Grant that&#39;s not a lot (78:26 - 78:31)
look if somebody could say hey I&#39;ve got (78:29 - 78:33)
a winning lottery ticket for you because (78:31 - 78:35)
I hacked the system yeah I&#39;ll buy that (78:33 - 78:36)
lottery (78:35 - 78:38)
ticket because that&#39;s what happened I (78:36 - 78:41)
did not to earn those either one of (78:38 - 78:44)
those yeah I I would expect that there (78:41 - 78:45)
will (78:44 - 78:48)
be a lot of shiny gimme ghouls for two (78:45 - 78:52)
weeks just because yeah unless a bunch (78:48 - 78:55)
of people come back to the game and then (78:52 - 78:59)
when I was trying to do raids to unlock (78:55 - 79:03)
them sit pulling up that menu before you (78:59 - 79:05)
had six star and seven star RS it would (79:03 - 79:08)
just come up blank and I&#39;m like there&#39;s (79:05 - 79:10)
nothing here I can&#39;t nobody&#39;s doing them (79:08 - 79:13)
I can&#39;t do them I can&#39;t actually (79:10 - 79:15)
progress this part of the story to (79:13 - 79:16)
unlock the thing that there&#39;s going to (79:15 - 79:20)
be more of because I cannot actually (79:16 - 79:24)
find a fstar raid to do and then if I (79:20 - 79:26)
undo mine (79:24 - 79:29)
Hit or Miss if somebody&#39;s able show up (79:26 - 79:31)
couldn&#39;t tell you I feel like the most (79:29 - 79:32)
part you you don&#39;t want those people to (79:31 - 79:35)
show up oh I know the NPCs have gotten (79:32 - 79:36)
better since the (79:35 - 79:40)
DLC they&#39;ll heal you (79:36 - 79:40)
now um so yeah so we&#39;ll have two so (79:41 - 79:48)
during August 9th through August 22nd so (79:44 - 79:50)
while people are out worlds while (79:48 - 79:52)
there&#39;s a world championship they&#39;ll be (79:50 - 79:54)
the gimi ghoul raids and then there&#39;ll (79:52 - 79:57)
be wal Rio com in mass outbreaks and (79:54 - 80:02)
then after that from August 23rd to (79:57 - 80:06)
September first so that&#39;s only (80:02 - 80:10)
like eight days mhm I don&#39;t know why (80:06 - 80:11)
Dragonite doesn&#39;t get the (80:10 - 80:14)
full Dragonite doesn&#39;t get the full twoe (80:11 - 80:16)
treatment apparently Dragonite with the (80:14 - 80:18)
mightiest Mark will appear for the first (80:16 - 80:19)
time in sevenstar raids it will be (80:18 - 80:22)
normal as its terot type which makes (80:19 - 80:25)
complete sense cuz normal Terra extreme (80:22 - 80:27)
speed Dragonite was incredibly dominant (80:25 - 80:30)
for a very long time um during this (80:27 - 80:33)
event uh look for outbreaks of Larvitar (80:30 - 80:36)
and beon throughout Pala mass outbreaks (80:33 - 80:40)
of gloomy and huian slugo in kitakami (80:36 - 80:42)
which is really cool and mass outbreaks (80:40 - 80:45)
of Beldum in the blueberry Academy hu (80:42 - 80:48)
huian SLU cannot be normally encountered (80:45 - 80:50)
Shiny Pokemon are more likely to appear (80:48 - 80:53)
and also uh these Pokemon will more (80:50 - 80:57)
likely have the Caris itic (80:53 - 80:59)
Mark and I just double checked the (80:57 - 81:02)
Pikachu stuff no Mark boosted at all (80:59 - 81:05)
it&#39;s just the last two events of the (81:02 - 81:08)
four (81:05 - 81:08)
events um that&#39;s like a lot of events to (81:08 - 81:14)
announce at once for the PO they need to (81:12 - 81:16)
get their summer stuff out of the way (81:14 - 81:18)
yeah it&#39;s like all the stuff that&#39;s (81:16 - 81:20)
leading up to Worlds and they just (81:18 - 81:23)
wanted to like get out it&#39;s up worlds (81:20 - 81:26)
and it&#39;s after world just summer this is (81:23 - 81:28)
just (81:26 - 81:30)
summer which is I guess why they&#39;re (81:28 - 81:34)
putting the starters on hold (81:30 - 81:34)
too as far as we can tell oh yeah yeah (81:34 - 81:39)
yeah yeah yeah so what where there&#39;s I (81:38 - 81:41)
think there&#39;s five starters left for (81:39 - 81:45)
alligator tort Tera (81:41 - 81:49)
Infernape Superior and and our boy in (81:45 - 81:53)
cinar I think there&#39;s think there&#39;s five (81:49 - 81:56)
left yeah (81:53 - 81:57)
uh every single seven star has had their (81:56 - 82:00)
hidden ability even Eevee and that was a (81:57 - 82:03)
bad ability for Eevee would have been (82:00 - 82:05)
way better for Eevee to have any other (82:03 - 82:07)
ability than its hidden ability um so (82:05 - 82:09)
dond Doo&#39;s water a hidden ability would (82:07 - 82:11)
be water Veil which means you cannot (82:09 - 82:12)
burn it which (82:11 - 82:15)
is actually really good for dondoo (82:12 - 82:18)
because burning a physical attacker goes (82:15 - 82:21)
a long way um so you won&#39;t be able to (82:18 - 82:23)
burn and then um Dragonite hidden (82:21 - 82:25)
ability is that multiscale or is that (82:23 - 82:27)
normal for Dragonite Dragonite let me (82:25 - 82:30)
double check it is multiscale uh I don&#39;t (82:27 - 82:32)
know how that would work in raids so (82:30 - 82:35)
multiscale reduces the (82:32 - 82:38)
damage by half when it&#39;s maximum HP now (82:35 - 82:40)
you might be saying well only on the (82:38 - 82:45)
first turn would that matter but (82:40 - 82:49)
technically a raid boss has 30 HP bars (82:45 - 82:53)
you just don&#39;t see them at once yeah (82:49 - 82:55)
and it (82:53 - 82:57)
the Pokemon that took advantage of that (82:55 - 82:59)
and and was kind of really weird was (82:57 - 83:03)
tyion with eruption because sometimes (82:59 - 83:06)
eruption would do a lot of damage and (83:03 - 83:07)
sometimes it would do nothing but you (83:06 - 83:11)
couldn&#39;t visually tell which of the 30 (83:07 - 83:14)
HP bars you were (83:11 - 83:14)
on (83:16 - 83:22)
so I guess there will be just some moves (83:19 - 83:26)
that just get reduced (83:22 - 83:30)
30 times I guess (83:26 - 83:34)
yeah I think I don&#39;t think it CH it (83:30 - 83:35)
doesn&#39;t really change the strategy of (83:34 - 83:37)
the raid right it&#39;s just like sometimes (83:35 - 83:39)
when you would hit Dragonite it&#39;s just (83:37 - 83:41)
not going to do as much damage yeah but (83:39 - 83:42)
you already have that when it does (83:41 - 83:45)
random number generation (83:42 - 83:48)
anyways so I guess sometimes it&#39;s going (83:45 - 83:51)
to be even worse like I don&#39;t know how (83:48 - 83:54)
you&#39;re going to know (83:51 - 83:54)
yeah (83:55 - 83:58)
um Dragonite attack is very high 1 135 (84:01 - 84:07)
you can burn the Dragonite though um and (84:05 - 84:10)
then dond Doo&#39;s attack (84:07 - 84:12)
is 100 so yeah Dragonite hits a little (84:10 - 84:13)
bit harder (84:12 - 84:17)
yeah um I love that they just announced (84:13 - 84:19)
two months of content for scarlet and (84:17 - 84:20)
violet I (84:19 - 84:24)
think that&#39;s a cool thing to do (84:20 - 84:24)
and I mean they really kind of they (84:25 - 84:28)
really kind of showed their hand before (84:27 - 84:31)
the DLC of what like future things look (84:28 - 84:34)
like which is mass outbreaks and raids (84:31 - 84:37)
but I think I think that&#39;s like good (84:34 - 84:39)
free content that gets you to come back (84:37 - 84:41)
it&#39;s not like oh yeah for sure buy this (84:39 - 84:44)
or pay a microtransaction or get a (84:41 - 84:46)
battle pass like if you&#39;re done with (84:44 - 84:47)
Pokemon you&#39;re done with Pokemon but if (84:46 - 84:49)
you&#39;re looking for something to do or (84:47 - 84:50)
you haven&#39;t gotten these shinies or you (84:49 - 84:52)
enjoy Seven Star raids like I think this (84:50 - 84:56)
is great long-term support for a game (84:52 - 84:58)
fix the frame (84:56 - 85:01)
rate good luck at this (84:58 - 85:04)
point that ship has sailed yeah to (85:01 - 85:05)
randle&#39;s (85:04 - 85:09)
[Laughter] (85:05 - 85:09)
Island yeah I wonder what the I wonder (85:09 - 85:13)
what the fall schedule will look like (85:11 - 85:15)
because once we&#39;re in September (85:13 - 85:17)
September October November December we (85:15 - 85:19)
have five we have five starters left and (85:17 - 85:20)
that&#39;s (85:19 - 85:21)
[Music] (85:20 - 85:24)
four that&#39;s four months and they&#39;ve (85:21 - 85:26)
usually been doing doing a starter every (85:24 - 85:29)
like 3 weeks I got to ramp it up get (85:26 - 85:31)
them in that&#39;s just enough time to get (85:29 - 85:34)
it in by the end of the year and then (85:31 - 85:37)
say next big game is out in January (85:34 - 85:43)
maybe 2025 I hope so no we we&#39;re not (85:37 - 85:44)
we&#39;re not getting it in (85:43 - 85:46)
January it&#39;s a Legends game we don&#39;t (85:44 - 85:48)
know that (85:46 - 85:51)
yet I don&#39;t think (85:48 - 85:53)
so I think we will we will get a release (85:51 - 85:56)
date for that game in (85:53 - 85:59)
February (85:56 - 85:59)
yeah um January is a long month though (86:00 - 86:06)
yeah yeah I just I don&#39;t know what (86:07 - 86:12)
company would just want to skip (86:11 - 86:14)
Christmas sales at this (86:12 - 86:17)
point because at Le at least at least (86:14 - 86:20)
with that one year they had bdsp carry (86:17 - 86:25)
through Christmas yeah (86:20 - 86:25)
um I don&#39;t know who knows uh I think (86:25 - 86:30)
that&#39;s our episode lot a lot of lot of (86:28 - 86:33)
stuff coming (86:30 - 86:33)
so and (86:34 - 86:38)
we&#39;re when this episode goes up we&#39;ll be (86:36 - 86:41)
exactly a month away from the World (86:38 - 86:44)
Championships so that&#39;s (86:41 - 86:46)
exciting so we&#39;ll see how that goes I (86:44 - 86:48)
guess if we were to hear about Legends (86:46 - 86:52)
it would probably be there yeah probably (86:48 - 86:54)
yep (86:52 - 86:56)
most likely time before Pokemon day of (86:54 - 86:59)
next (86:56 - 86:59)
year I think I I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m (86:59 - 87:03)
completely convinced we hear about (87:01 - 87:06)
Legends at (87:03 - 87:07)
Worlds like they could just show the (87:06 - 87:09)
same trailer again and I guess somebody (87:07 - 87:12)
could be like see they they they did it (87:09 - 87:14)
like yeah I guess I mean we&#39;ll mention (87:12 - 87:16)
it probably I think for sure we see (87:14 - 87:18)
pocket and we get a release date for (87:16 - 87:19)
pocket (87:18 - 87:22)
100% because they said pocket was coming (87:19 - 87:24)
this year they did not they yeah I mean (87:22 - 87:27)
they just said Legends was (87:24 - 87:31)
202 yeah they didn&#39;t even say (87:27 - 87:31)
early (87:33 - 87:39)
um and if pocket is as as as big big as (87:35 - 87:42)
I&#39;m personally (87:39 - 87:42)
expecting then I would assume all their (87:42 - 87:47)
marketing is going to go into (87:45 - 87:50)
that they haven&#39;t marketed a mobile game (87:47 - 87:52)
like that in a while so that would be (87:50 - 87:54)
interesting they didn&#39;t really have to (87:52 - 87:57)
Market Pokémon go which probably did (87:54 - 88:00)
they didn&#39;t have it just it just became (87:57 - 88:03)
that success it just was what it was (88:00 - 88:05)
when I think of like Marvel snap like (88:03 - 88:07)
that game had so much marketing behind (88:05 - 88:10)
it but it was also from what I&#39;ve been (88:07 - 88:13)
told very good a very good game I think (88:10 - 88:15)
I recently learned that the lead (88:13 - 88:19)
developer of hearthstone left blizzard (88:15 - 88:21)
to then make Marvel snap that makes (88:19 - 88:22)
sense (88:21 - 88:25)
yeah so (88:22 - 88:27)
I would say that they they did kind of (88:25 - 88:30)
do a lot of advertising behind Masters (88:27 - 88:31)
like I kind of felt like they were (88:30 - 88:35)
really hyping up Masters more than a lot (88:31 - 88:37)
of their mobile stuff at the (88:35 - 88:42)
time and rightly so that game (88:37 - 88:42)
Run even even unite got remember when (88:43 - 88:48)
unite got that whole press conference (88:46 - 88:50)
and people were so mad because it was (88:48 - 88:53)
not let&#39;s go jotto yeah but unite&#39;s also (88:50 - 88:55)
a good game (88:53 - 88:59)
yeah it&#39;s a good game right (88:55 - 88:59)
now I I just think that pocket is going (89:00 - 89:06)
to be a very long-term we I mean in this (89:03 - 89:08)
episode we just talked about how han Kai (89:06 - 89:13)
star rail made 95 million do in a month (89:08 - 89:15)
and like it&#39;s very cool Pokemon sleep (89:13 - 89:18)
made a100 million in a (89:15 - 89:20)
year but I when I&#39;m thinking of like (89:18 - 89:23)
what Pokemon game can make 50 plus (89:20 - 89:26)
million dollars in a month it is a TCG (89:23 - 89:29)
pocket yeah game oh for sure those those (89:26 - 89:32)
are like quick TCG games (89:29 - 89:34)
[Music] (89:32 - 89:38)
are the mobile dream for most companies (89:34 - 89:40)

prints money yeah I have no clue how (89:40 - 89:44)
much Marvel snap makes but I&#39;m I&#39;m (89:42 - 89:46)
