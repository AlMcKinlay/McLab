[Music] (0:01 - 0:29)
what's up everyone welcome to the 451st (0:25 - 0:31)
episode of the pokemon podcast it's (0:29 - 0:34)
super effective i'm your host sbj i was (0:31 - 0:35)
a little (0:34 - 0:38)
a little wary on the little number we (0:35 - 0:39)
were at (0:38 - 0:42)
abbey was a big number last time i know (0:39 - 0:43)
it's like a reset (0:42 - 0:47)
yeah four five one here to talk about (0:43 - 0:48)
pokemon is (0:47 - 0:52)
greg hello i'm here i am back (0:48 - 0:56)
in my slowly being renovated uh study (0:52 - 1:00)
i have study well i can't call it office (0:56 - 1:02)
because i can't see i don't work in here (1:00 - 1:04)
well (1:02 - 1:06)
i don't do work work in here i work on (1:04 - 1:07)
other things in here (1:06 - 1:10)
but uh (1:07 - 1:10)
a year of collecting things through (1:10 - 1:14)
delivery has (1:13 - 1:17)
made my house untenable and things need (1:14 - 1:19)
to change (1:17 - 1:21)
i need new areas to put the things that (1:19 - 1:22)
i purchased (1:21 - 1:25)
because i've had money that i wasn't (1:22 - 1:26)
using unsp (1:25 - 1:30)
on traveling just get a new house (1:26 - 1:33)
no i have a big enough house as it is (1:30 - 1:34)
plus i would have to then take (1:33 - 1:37)
everything out of this house and put it (1:34 - 1:38)
in the new house (1:37 - 1:39)
without a whole other set of problems (1:38 - 1:41)
i'll be doing that (1:39 - 1:44)
in a couple of months (1:41 - 1:44)
will here in honor of episode 451 (1:44 - 1:51)
uh we will be doing a retrospective and (1:49 - 1:53)
analysis of the entire bibliography of (1:51 - 1:55)
rape bradbury (1:53 - 1:58)
right correct yes who (1:55 - 2:01)
okay i'm not going to ask whoa (1:58 - 2:01)
okay bradberry dude (2:04 - 2:11)
ray sounds like a baseball player yes (2:09 - 2:13)
that is no he's an author (2:11 - 2:15)
i remember back in high school we set (2:13 - 2:17)
the oven (2:15 - 2:21)
to 451 degrees and shoved a book in (2:17 - 2:22)
there (2:21 - 2:23)
to see what would happen did it burst (2:22 - 2:26)
into flame it did not but it did turn (2:23 - 2:27)
black (2:26 - 2:30)
it did crest over but we were expecting (2:27 - 2:31)
like (2:30 - 2:35)
a giant burst of fire (2:31 - 2:37)
and we were very disappointed when we (2:35 - 2:39)
did not get a giant burst of fire (2:37 - 2:42)
instead we just got slowly curling pages (2:39 - 2:44)
until it (2:42 - 2:47)
turned into ash yeah uh there's uh that (2:44 - 2:48)
whole triangle (2:47 - 2:52)
of needing like fuel oxygen (2:48 - 2:55)
and the whatever energy source (2:52 - 2:58)
to create fire that you were missing (2:55 - 2:59)
part of that so we were missing part of (2:58 - 3:01)
that we had we had a lot of direct (2:59 - 3:04)
heat but not actual flame uh just (3:01 - 3:08)
to inform uh mr surumi uh (3:04 - 3:10)
ray bradbury is the author of the (3:08 - 3:13)
fahrenheit 451 which is a seminal book (3:10 - 3:16)
about uh well (3:13 - 3:19)
what is it censorship is a good way to (3:16 - 3:20)
put it which is hilarious because (3:19 - 3:23)
it was when it first came out uh people (3:20 - 3:26)
tried to ban it (3:23 - 3:28)
so when i refer to the show as double (3:26 - 3:31)
plus good you should look at me (3:28 - 3:33)
yeah but that's not ray bradbury that's (3:31 - 3:34)
uh orson (3:33 - 3:37)
uh no i thought perfectly what was (3:34 - 3:38)
double plus good (3:37 - 3:41)
double plus good is wow now we're just (3:38 - 3:43)
gone down a dystopian (3:41 - 3:45)
rabbit hole of dystopia ray brady pepper (3:43 - 3:46)
a science fiction (3:45 - 3:48)
author but like more of like a literary (3:46 - 3:49)
science fiction (3:48 - 3:51)
author i think he also did the martian (3:49 - 3:52)
chronicles i'm pretty sure (3:51 - 3:55)
yeah yeah yeah uh but yeah you know oh (3:52 - 3:57)
definitely as good as 1984. (3:55 - 4:00)
yeah that's right you know (3:57 - 4:03)
there's a lot of dystopian novels yes (4:00 - 4:05)
many of them did not actually pan out (4:03 - 4:07)
the way (4:05 - 4:12)
people predicted speaking of dystopia (4:07 - 4:15)
pokemon cards still sold out (4:12 - 4:19)
i actually recently discovered (4:15 - 4:22)
that one yes that was confirmed for me (4:19 - 4:24)
that yes pokemon cards are still sold (4:22 - 4:24)
out (4:24 - 4:28)
but also uh baseball cards and (4:24 - 4:30)
no actually i'm sorry it's not baseball (4:28 - 4:32)
cards it's like football and basketball (4:30 - 4:34)
cards which who even knew that was a (4:32 - 4:34)
thing (4:34 - 4:38)
yeah are sold out most targets well i (4:34 - 4:38)
guess (4:38 - 4:40)
your mileage may vary but they usually (4:38 - 4:42)
have a limit of (4:40 - 4:44)
three cards in general whether it's (4:42 - 4:46)
magic yu-gi-oh (4:44 - 4:49)
baseball football golf (4:46 - 4:50)
i don't think golf carts are a thing (4:49 - 4:53)
maybe they are i don't think (4:50 - 4:55)
oh which is amazing that that magic and (4:53 - 4:57)
yu-gi-oh cards are still available (4:55 - 4:58)
because (4:57 - 5:04)
what does that say yeah i'm not sure why (4:58 - 5:04)
i i guess i don't know i don't know (5:04 - 5:07)
magic or yugo enough to know why they (5:06 - 5:09)
haven't been hit by the (5:07 - 5:13)
scalper crazy i mean magic's a hot mess (5:09 - 5:16)
right like even even if you're gonna try (5:13 - 5:17)
to figure out (5:16 - 5:21)
what pack has the good thing in it (5:17 - 5:25)
people aren't gonna be like oh (5:21 - 5:28)
you you picked up demonic tudor i love (5:25 - 5:30)
that character (5:28 - 5:32)
but actually oh it's a chromatic lantern (5:30 - 5:34)
i love them in the anime (5:32 - 5:37)
but actually the main thing is with (5:34 - 5:38)
magic that (5:37 - 5:41)
the packs that have the stuff that would (5:38 - 5:41)
be (5:41 - 5:44)
of value like collecting valuable (5:41 - 5:48)
uh those packs are about like a hundred (5:44 - 5:51)
dollars per pack yeah already (5:48 - 5:54)
yeah so you can't just go in and buy (5:51 - 5:56)
a whole bunch and think i'm gonna strike (5:54 - 5:58)
it rich for four dollars a pack (5:56 - 6:01)
well magic needs to work with the (5:58 - 6:02)
pokemon company to get charizard over (6:01 - 6:04)
there (6:02 - 6:07)
and then they're probably they're give (6:04 - 6:07)
it (6:07 - 6:10)
to 2022 because they are combining (6:07 - 6:12)
universes much to the consternation of (6:10 - 6:13)
many in the magic community (6:12 - 6:16)
this is very true but according to the (6:13 - 6:17)
target website there are (6:16 - 6:21)
some trading card pokemon trading card (6:17 - 6:24)
bundles at my local target (6:21 - 6:27)
that target website's never right i can (6:24 - 6:28)
get the small (6:27 - 6:31)
but mighty premium collection it is in (6:28 - 6:32)
stock (6:31 - 6:34)
right now however it is not eligible for (6:32 - 6:35)
me to (6:34 - 6:37)
pick it up yeah i actually have to go (6:35 - 6:38)
into the store and maybe (6:37 - 6:39)
which means by the time you get there (6:38 - 6:42)
it's gone i also can get the champions (6:39 - 6:43)
path collection (6:42 - 6:46)
double v which is apparently in stock (6:43 - 6:49)
but also not eligible no one wants (6:46 - 6:52)
mcchampion's path (6:49 - 6:52)
let's do the pokemon news the little (6:53 - 6:56)
sound goes here (6:55 - 7:02)
i wait i've got some pokemon tcg news (6:56 - 7:06)
uh okay all right professor (7:02 - 7:09)
willow will be printed as a pokemon card (7:06 - 7:12)
this summer hi did you steal my news it (7:09 - 7:15)
is a crossover between pokemon go and (7:12 - 7:16)
the pokemon (7:15 - 7:18)
what did they say it's like uh a (7:16 - 7:19)
collaboration (7:18 - 7:21)
but no no no but they made it sound like (7:19 - 7:23)
that this like was a (7:21 - 7:26)
very in-depth deep negotiation (7:23 - 7:30)
for pokemon go and pokemon (7:26 - 7:33)
collaboration has been finalized between (7:30 - 7:34)
the pokemon go (7:33 - 7:36)
and the pokemon trading card game as if (7:34 - 7:38)
they're not the same (7:36 - 7:43)
company oh that was hilarious (7:38 - 7:43)
for for pokemon news to finally start (7:43 - 7:48)
where pokemon go news just finally start (7:46 - 7:50)
working again on my app and for that to (7:48 - 7:52)
be the first news item that comes (7:50 - 7:53)
through (7:52 - 7:56)
okay hold on let's put a pin in the (7:53 - 7:58)
professor willow we'll come back to that (7:56 - 7:59)
because we got a that'll translate (7:58 - 8:01)
you're gonna ruin the value if you put a (7:59 - 8:02)
pin in it that's really (8:01 - 8:06)
true uh we we had an itunes review the (8:02 - 8:07)
other day (8:06 - 8:10)
that said that they liked the show but (8:07 - 8:12)
we didn't talk about the tcg (8:10 - 8:14)
and the anime enough did we not spend (8:12 - 8:15)
like (8:14 - 8:17)
three whole podcasts spending 40 some (8:15 - 8:21)
minutes talking about the tcg problem (8:17 - 8:22)
i don't know i zoned out at those parts (8:21 - 8:24)
the problem there is probably that we (8:22 - 8:25)
don't go like (8:24 - 8:28)
in depth of like what are the good cards (8:25 - 8:29)
versus what is the chaff (8:28 - 8:31)
yeah which is never going to be so you (8:29 - 8:32)
are running (8:31 - 8:35)
that's not never been our our wheelhouse (8:32 - 8:37)
yeah we also don't do that for like (8:35 - 8:39)
hey what do you what team are you (8:37 - 8:41)
bringing in the pikachu raids this (8:39 - 8:43)
weekend like (8:41 - 8:46)
we should we could we could um but there (8:43 - 8:48)
there's just better resources for (8:46 - 8:50)
i mean we all know you're bringing uh (8:48 - 8:52)
gaster down with your storm drain and (8:50 - 8:54)
then being all surprised when (8:52 - 8:56)
nobody's water moves work and blaming it (8:54 - 8:58)
on chat for ruining it that was their (8:56 - 9:00)
their problem not mine (8:58 - 9:02)
this is why people earthquake in your (9:00 - 9:04)
raids no i haven't been earthquaked in a (9:02 - 9:05)
while (9:04 - 9:07)
also even if we were to talk about what (9:05 - 9:09)
tcg decks are good the only (9:07 - 9:11)
adp that's it that's like there's no (9:09 - 9:13)
other deck you just run adp (9:11 - 9:15)
with zashian and then sometimes you run (9:13 - 9:16)
rusted shield sometimes you don't (9:15 - 9:18)
sometimes you run the air balloon i (9:16 - 9:18)
don't know (9:18 - 9:21)
there there's your tcp minute i told you (9:18 - 9:23)
all the decks that possibly exist in the (9:21 - 9:24)
tcg right now until august (9:23 - 9:28)
is there a good (9:24 - 9:31)
website to go find current meta decks (9:28 - 9:33)
if i wanted to build one from scratch (9:31 - 9:34)
gosh it used to be six (9:33 - 9:38)
prizes back in the day yeah six prizes (9:34 - 9:39)
closed down though (9:38 - 9:42)
well yeah dude um what is the one (9:39 - 9:44)
there's a subreddit that's pretty good (9:42 - 9:46)
um we're never gonna get ready nugget (9:44 - 9:47)
bridge is vgc (9:46 - 9:50)
oh they shut down a long time ago really (9:47 - 9:53)
yeah they're done nugget bridge is gone (9:50 - 9:55)
where do all the evil people congregate (9:53 - 9:55)
now (9:55 - 9:58)
[Music] (9:55 - 10:01)
we covered this it's written um well (9:58 - 10:01)
it's (10:01 - 10:04)
it's been pretty easy to get teams in (10:01 - 10:05)
general for sword and shield just (10:04 - 10:06)
honestly off twitter (10:05 - 10:11)
people will share their teams uh or (10:06 - 10:13)
um right there are there are good (10:11 - 10:15)
reddits of sharing teams or (10:13 - 10:18)
sharing decks but i mean (10:15 - 10:21)
the ptcgo you can just copy and paste (10:18 - 10:22)
the deck list and (10:21 - 10:24)
you're good to go and sort of shield you (10:22 - 10:26)
can just copy and paste the (10:24 - 10:28)
whatever that code is called and you're (10:26 - 10:29)
good to go (10:28 - 10:31)
i don't know maybe we'll circle back uh (10:29 - 10:33)
i'm not sure which which websites are (10:31 - 10:34)
good although like (10:33 - 10:36)
if anyone's thinking about getting into (10:34 - 10:37)
competitive trading card (10:36 - 10:40)
pcg like now now is not the time uh no (10:37 - 10:43)
no like tournaments going on adp is it's (10:40 - 10:45)
a joke but it's actually (10:43 - 10:47)
like the most dominant deck and nothing (10:45 - 10:48)
can really compete with it (10:47 - 10:52)
um but adp would be rotating oh sorry (10:48 - 10:54)
for the non-tcg players you're probably (10:52 - 10:56)
like what the heck is adp (10:54 - 10:59)
it's arceus dialga palkia they put all (10:56 - 11:00)
three of them on one (10:59 - 11:03)
card they need to get rid of them before (11:00 - 11:04)
the gen 4 remakes (11:03 - 11:06)
and then they can reissue it as part of (11:04 - 11:08)
the gen x (11:06 - 11:10)
into the z zone so they've been floating (11:08 - 11:11)
around in space (11:10 - 11:13)
yes uh and then they'll be broken out (11:11 - 11:16)
later you know you joke but the tcg used (11:13 - 11:16)
to have (11:16 - 11:20)
weird stuff like that i remember there (11:16 - 11:21)
was a place like the poke gym (11:20 - 11:23)
or something that i used to look up (11:21 - 11:24)
decks back back back in the day to see (11:23 - 11:26)
if there was rosalia anything that i (11:24 - 11:27)
wanted to use (11:26 - 11:28)
and then i said you know what i don't (11:27 - 11:30)
want to do this roselia has never been a (11:28 - 11:31)
good card (11:30 - 11:33)
i'm sorry rosa always playing a good (11:31 - 11:34)
card yeah they always give the good (11:33 - 11:35)
stuff the vibe (11:34 - 11:37)
yeah this is why i don't play this dumb (11:35 - 11:39)
game (11:37 - 11:42)
um yeah we'll have to circle back on (11:39 - 11:43)
what resources are good there's there (11:42 - 11:44)
there are (11:43 - 11:46)
like um tcg podcasts out the pokemon tcg (11:44 - 11:48)
podcast there are pokemon competitive (11:46 - 11:49)
podcasts out there (11:48 - 11:51)
uh like the pokesports podcast which i (11:49 - 11:53)
was on before like they're really great (11:51 - 11:54)
if you want something competitive in (11:53 - 11:55)
sword and shield (11:54 - 11:59)
um anyways uh (11:55 - 12:02)
this is off pokemon.com the tcg shining (11:59 - 12:05)
fates still exists somewhere (12:02 - 12:07)
in scalpers hands premium collection (12:05 - 12:08)
shiny crobat (12:07 - 12:12)
v-max and shiny dragopalt v-max (12:08 - 12:14)
are now available they launched marth (12:12 - 12:15)
march 5th (12:14 - 12:17)
uh they went up on pokemon center they (12:15 - 12:19)
sold out i'm not joking in about 45 (12:17 - 12:20)
seconds (12:19 - 12:24)
um each will have a (12:20 - 12:26)
promo card one obviously the shiny (12:24 - 12:28)
crowbar will have the shiny crowbar the (12:26 - 12:30)
the other one will have shiny dragopalt (12:28 - 12:32)
uh they will have the (12:30 - 12:36)
bigger promo cards that you can collect (12:32 - 12:38)
and then they have uh coins and then (12:36 - 12:40)
each come with seven (12:38 - 12:43)
booster packs so and seven shining fates (12:40 - 12:44)
booster packs (12:43 - 12:46)
and shining fates has a pretty good hit (12:44 - 12:47)
rate (12:46 - 12:50)
um so what that means is like you're (12:47 - 12:51)
more likely to (12:50 - 12:55)
pull the fancy full art cards than not (12:51 - 12:58)
but it is a smaller set the thing that (12:55 - 12:59)
people want (12:58 - 13:02)
is charizard i think eternitis is like a (12:59 - 13:02)
30 (13:02 - 13:06)
card which is pretty okay but (13:02 - 13:08)
is it like a card like a good card to (13:06 - 13:09)
use in your deck (13:08 - 13:12)
or alternatives is good if adp didn't (13:09 - 13:13)
exist (13:12 - 13:15)
uh yeah uh charizard's not good it's (13:13 - 13:16)
just (13:15 - 13:20)
charizard it's just like (13:16 - 13:21)
how much longer are we going to be under (13:20 - 13:23)
the yoke of adp (13:21 - 13:26)
do they finally get okay august and then (13:23 - 13:27)
adp will be (13:26 - 13:29)
unless for whatever reason they do some (13:27 - 13:31)
weird rules they reprint it change (13:29 - 13:34)
they could reprint it yeah so shining (13:31 - 13:36)
fates premium collection is apparently (13:34 - 13:37)
out there (13:36 - 13:41)
good luck finding it um (13:37 - 13:44)
speaking of more tcg stuff uh they (13:41 - 13:46)
showed some more cards for battle styles (13:44 - 13:48)
obviously this set is already available (13:46 - 13:49)
in japan so you could have probably (13:48 - 13:50)
looked it up (13:49 - 13:53)
but they showed off on pokemon.com tapu (13:50 - 13:54)
coco (13:53 - 13:57)
uh urshifu there's the single striker (13:54 - 13:58)
shifu v (13:57 - 14:00)
there's the rapid strike urshifu v (13:58 - 14:02)
there's the tapu coco v (14:00 - 14:04)
there's the tapu coco v max there's a (14:02 - 14:05)
flapple v (14:04 - 14:08)
max in the set uh what i'm in which is (14:05 - 14:10)
that's really great (14:08 - 14:11)
[Laughter] (14:10 - 14:15)
love me some flapple uh the the probably (14:11 - 14:17)
the chase card in the set chase card (14:15 - 14:17)
being (14:17 - 14:20)
meaning the most sought-after card would (14:17 - 14:21)
be the (14:20 - 14:25)
secret art hershey foo (14:21 - 14:26)
it's really hard to explain it's a (14:25 - 14:28)
good-looking card though uh but overall (14:26 - 14:29)
battle styles is going to launch (14:28 - 14:33)
march 19th so in about two weeks (14:29 - 14:35)
and it will have 160 cards which is not (14:33 - 14:37)
the biggest set in the world (14:35 - 14:40)
but i still do think this is going to be (14:37 - 14:43)
more of a not a collector set but more (14:40 - 14:44)
of a set for people (14:43 - 14:47)
who want to play competitively (14:44 - 14:50)
a competitive set someone say yes (14:47 - 14:51)
although it's (14:50 - 14:54)
uh nothing's good adp's still going to (14:51 - 14:55)
be good (14:54 - 14:58)
but it's setting the foundation for a (14:55 - 14:59)
new (14:58 - 15:02)
sort of new new mechanic yes which is (14:59 - 15:04)
battle styles (15:02 - 15:06)
do you know what that mechanic does yet (15:04 - 15:08)
what no you just pick which (15:06 - 15:09)
battle style and then the cards that you (15:08 - 15:11)
use in your deck (15:09 - 15:14)
support that battle style yeah so (15:11 - 15:16)
like you you if you do single strike (15:14 - 15:18)
battle style then you build your deck (15:16 - 15:20)
with single strike (15:18 - 15:22)
cards and do they have like a new (15:20 - 15:23)
synergy together (15:22 - 15:27)
or is it just that so for example (15:23 - 15:30)
it'll the so some cards won't be single (15:27 - 15:31)
striker rapid strike they'll just be (15:30 - 15:32)
your normal cards right (15:31 - 15:34)
like adp doesn't say single striker (15:32 - 15:36)
rapid strike in the corner but (15:34 - 15:38)
if you have like a single strike or (15:36 - 15:40)
shifu (15:38 - 15:42)
and then maybe you have a single strike (15:40 - 15:44)
uh (15:42 - 15:47)
esper and then i i don't think that's (15:44 - 15:49)
for a single strike i'm just aiming (15:47 - 15:52)
but then you had a single strike machamp (15:49 - 15:54)
the machampa might have an ability (15:52 - 15:57)
that says any single strike card in play (15:54 - 15:58)
will get (15:57 - 16:01)
20. okay plus damage boost (15:58 - 16:02)
so adp wouldn't get that because it (16:01 - 16:04)
doesn't say single strike but any card (16:02 - 16:05)
that does (16:04 - 16:08)
would get that boost yeah (16:05 - 16:11)
so i would encourage you to build decks (16:08 - 16:14)
around the single strike slash rapid (16:11 - 16:15)
strike mechanic but since this is the (16:14 - 16:16)
first set (16:15 - 16:18)
none of that will really be good until (16:16 - 16:20)
three months later when a (16:18 - 16:22)
more single strike rapid strike will be (16:20 - 16:24)
introduced (16:22 - 16:26)
yeah but the thing is like also that (16:24 - 16:28)
they may introduce (16:26 - 16:31)
core cards for this mechanic that may (16:28 - 16:33)
not get reprinted in the future so it's (16:31 - 16:35)
kind of like buy in (16:33 - 16:38)
now so that you have those cards that (16:35 - 16:39)
are going to be important (16:38 - 16:41)
in a year from now i think that this (16:39 - 16:43)
will be the first thing that you will be (16:41 - 16:45)
able to walk into target (16:43 - 16:49)
and buy off the shelf maybe not right (16:45 - 16:51)
away how many charizard are in the set (16:49 - 16:53)
zero charizards zero people how many (16:51 - 16:55)
pikachus europeans (16:53 - 16:56)
how many rows rates are in the set i (16:55 - 16:58)
don't think any (16:56 - 16:59)
one but if you want to know how many (16:58 - 17:01)
hershey's are in this set probably like (16:59 - 17:02)
six (17:01 - 17:04)
if you like hershey food i i mean i (17:02 - 17:05)
haven't looked at the (17:04 - 17:08)
the card list so this is completely off (17:05 - 17:10)
the top of my head but my suspicion is (17:08 - 17:11)
that it's (17:10 - 17:15)
probably weighted heavily towards (17:11 - 17:18)
fighting types oh yeah (17:15 - 17:22)
we're looking at a (17:18 - 17:22)
website that is showing japanese (17:24 - 17:27)
versions and (17:26 - 17:30)
viper and zangoose are shown and they (17:27 - 17:32)
are not those two pokemon like to fight (17:30 - 17:34)
each other that's what i've heard so (17:32 - 17:37)
okay here's a quiz (17:34 - 17:38)
which one is single strikes and which (17:37 - 17:40)
one is rapid strikes do you (17:38 - 17:42)
i would have i know the answer assume (17:40 - 17:44)
that (17:42 - 17:47)
the viper's rapid and the xangoose is (17:44 - 17:48)
single (17:47 - 17:51)
oh wait wait wait wait snakes can go (17:48 - 17:55)
yeah yes i i agree with this (17:51 - 17:59)
you're wrong well it's a viper is the (17:55 - 18:00)
single strike it just (17:59 - 18:03)
and then only once only once it's gone (18:00 - 18:04)
it's (18:03 - 18:06)
one and done one and then goose has to (18:04 - 18:07)
scratch a whole bunch apparently (18:06 - 18:09)
i guess that makes sense it was it was (18:07 - 18:11)
50 50. (18:09 - 18:14)
it was and you got it wrong (18:11 - 18:17)
uh also pokemon.com the pokemon tcg (18:14 - 18:20)
top deck academy episode 5 is available (18:17 - 18:21)
i feel like the last time we talked (18:20 - 18:23)
about this was episode one (18:21 - 18:25)
so they are continuing to put out (18:23 - 18:26)
episodes (18:25 - 18:30)
on their youtube so if you are (18:26 - 18:31)
trying to learn how to play the pokemon (18:30 - 18:34)
trading card game top deck academy is (18:31 - 18:36)
probably what you want to watch i guess (18:34 - 18:37)
how many (18:36 - 18:39)
did we say they were doing 10 i think we (18:37 - 18:42)
guessed are we halfway (18:39 - 18:45)
yeah cause what is five cover uh it (18:42 - 18:45)
covers (18:45 - 18:49)
five covers energy cards tool cards (18:45 - 18:52)
recovery search cards (18:49 - 18:53)
gives you a deck here gives you a (18:52 - 18:55)
cottony uh greedan (18:53 - 18:59)
crobat deck not sure what recovery means (18:55 - 19:04)
that's like healing yourself i i guess (18:59 - 19:06)
step one was the main deck step two was (19:04 - 19:08)
tools step figures recovery cards (19:06 - 19:11)
four draw in search cards and step five (19:08 - 19:12)
okay energy cards in this (19:11 - 19:15)
instance the recovery is using an (19:12 - 19:16)
ordinary rod (19:15 - 19:17)
to get the whimsicott out of your (19:16 - 19:19)
discard pile that's what i was going to (19:17 - 19:21)
say recovering things from discard (19:19 - 19:26)
a very stable eye type mechanic yes (19:21 - 19:29)
okay and then the last bit of tcg news (19:26 - 19:32)
was a collaboration has been finalized (19:29 - 19:33)
between (19:32 - 19:37)
pokemons yeah but you see the transition (19:33 - 19:38)
was like (19:37 - 19:41)
we we we start with the tcg and then we (19:38 - 19:43)
do the tcg slash pokemon go and then it (19:41 - 19:45)
transitions into pokemon go (19:43 - 19:48)
see as a host in my head i had a (19:45 - 19:48)
structure (19:48 - 19:50)
yeah one of these days as the host you (19:48 - 19:52)
might want to put an outline for (19:50 - 19:54)
us yeah you could reveal that to the (19:52 - 19:55)
rest of us (19:54 - 19:57)
the master plan is even though this (19:55 - 20:01)
program is completely scripted (19:57 - 20:03)
anybody's watching the video like i can (20:01 - 20:05)
my eyes keep darting to the side to (20:03 - 20:08)
look at the screen description okay so (20:05 - 20:11)
what does this mean (20:08 - 20:11)
part one of the collaboration is (20:13 - 20:16)
professor willow will appear in the (20:14 - 20:18)
pokemon trading card game in the summer (20:16 - 20:19)
of 2021 (20:18 - 20:21)
which marks the five-year anniversary of (20:19 - 20:23)
pokemon go we plan (20:21 - 20:26)
for this card to be attained obtainable (20:23 - 20:28)
in regions around the world where tcg is (20:26 - 20:29)
sold (20:28 - 20:32)
starting in late may of 2021 (20:29 - 20:35)
we plan to announce art and content of (20:32 - 20:37)
the professor willow card and details on (20:35 - 20:38)
how (20:37 - 20:40)
the card will look in each area does (20:38 - 20:41)
this mean that willow will have a (20:40 - 20:43)
different design for each language (20:41 - 20:45)
um we will then make announcements for (20:43 - 20:47)
further collaborations (20:45 - 20:49)
uh to be determined so we hope you look (20:47 - 20:50)
out for those (20:49 - 20:51)
and then if you didn't know the pokemon (20:50 - 20:53)
trader card game is a two-player game (20:51 - 20:54)
head-to-head card game place in the (20:53 - 20:55)
pokemon video game series you can (20:54 - 20:57)
experience the fun and collecting of the (20:55 - 20:58)
pokemon trading card game building your (20:57 - 20:58)
own decks (20:58 - 21:00)
buying cards from scalpers and using (20:58 - 21:02)
pokemon in battles (21:00 - 21:03)
weird that they included that part on (21:02 - 21:05)
the website yeah scalpers yeah (21:03 - 21:07)
uh i can already tell you what the (21:05 - 21:09)
professor willow card like (21:07 - 21:11)
mechanic is gonna be it's gonna be (21:09 - 21:13)
supporter number one (21:11 - 21:18)
it's gonna be discard your hand trust us (21:13 - 21:18)
what if it's discard your hand to get (21:23 - 21:29)
five candies from a judge what if it was (21:26 - 21:31)
and then the judge brings over a (21:29 - 21:33)
selection of candies for you to take (21:31 - 21:35)
and then you're just down but you have a (21:33 - 21:36)
snack what it was discard your hands (21:35 - 21:38)
searching your deck for three (21:36 - 21:41)
raspberries (21:38 - 21:41)
um yeah i think that i think this is (21:42 - 21:47)
exciting i i think people genuinely do (21:45 - 21:49)
like professor willow i think we could (21:47 - 21:51)
all agree that like when pokemon (21:49 - 21:54)
go came out no one really actually cared (21:51 - 21:54)
about (21:54 - 21:58)
willow or the three (21:54 - 22:01)
team leaders and they're kind of really (21:58 - 22:03)
give them the character we care about (22:01 - 22:05)
sparky yeah we care about sparky i don't (22:03 - 22:06)
think people cared about that dude until (22:05 - 22:08)
he dabbed (22:06 - 22:11)
no everybody cared about that dude (22:08 - 22:12)
because he was awesome because (22:11 - 22:15)
team instinct is amazing right nobody (22:12 - 22:16)
cared about your other boring (22:15 - 22:18)
leaders because they did nothing but (22:16 - 22:20)
stand there and look judgy (22:18 - 22:22)
did they even give them names yeah yeah (22:20 - 22:23)
yes there's (22:22 - 22:26)
spark and then um there's lady blue and (22:23 - 22:26)
lady red (22:26 - 22:28)
gosh what is their name it's not cool (22:26 - 22:30)
yeah exactly (22:28 - 22:34)
blanche blanche her name is the black (22:30 - 22:37)
it is blanche what is the the red lady's (22:34 - 22:38)
name (22:37 - 22:41)
exactly lady red and lady blue no her (22:38 - 22:43)
name is blanche (22:41 - 22:47)
which means white so oddly (22:43 - 22:49)
god choice for names i'm pretty sure (22:47 - 22:51)
it's blanche (22:49 - 22:54)
uh team mystic leader is bland it is (22:51 - 22:56)
blanche (22:54 - 22:58)
but who's the other one i want to say (22:56 - 23:00)
it's (22:58 - 23:00)
uh i do (23:00 - 23:07)
i'm going to say it's victoria because v (23:04 - 23:10)
for valor (23:07 - 23:10)
i don't think that's true i don't think (23:10 - 23:14)
that's how it works either because (23:12 - 23:15)
sparky is (23:14 - 23:18)
not starting with a y yeah but it has a (23:15 - 23:19)
y at the end (23:18 - 23:22)
correct no his name is spark it's not (23:19 - 23:23)
sparky (23:22 - 23:25)
sure i mean it's sparky to his friends (23:23 - 23:27)
exactly (23:25 - 23:30)
those of us okay so it is (23:27 - 23:34)
candela oh candy and spark (23:30 - 23:37)
big fan of the chandelier i bet (23:34 - 23:41)
i guess okay so i think if i (23:37 - 23:44)
i do think it would be cool and i guess (23:41 - 23:47)
let me reread the sentence again (23:44 - 23:49)
starting in late may of 2021 we plan to (23:47 - 23:50)
announce the (23:49 - 23:52)
art and content of the professor willow (23:50 - 23:54)
card and details how the card will look (23:52 - 23:55)
in each area (23:54 - 23:57)
that's such a vague sentence i'm (23:55 - 24:00)
assuming each area is like (23:57 - 24:02)
each different area of where the (24:00 - 24:04)
language changes so like the german (24:02 - 24:07)
cards the italian cards the spanish (24:04 - 24:09)
cards (24:07 - 24:11)
the japanese cards so you have to make a (24:09 - 24:13)
correction (24:11 - 24:16)
what blanche is non-binary they have (24:13 - 24:17)
confirmed (24:16 - 24:20)
oh i thought i thought um candela was (24:17 - 24:22)
non-binary no i just had to look at i (24:20 - 24:24)
just looked this up (24:22 - 24:28)
i didn't know all right (24:24 - 24:31)
i mean i'm into this now i'm into the (24:28 - 24:33)
deep lore i've gone down (24:31 - 24:35)
i've gone down their biographies now (24:33 - 24:36)
this is like when i was telling my (24:35 - 24:38)
friend the other night i was like oh do (24:36 - 24:40)
you know gibraltar is gay in apex (24:38 - 24:41)
legends and he was like what now i'm (24:40 - 24:44)
super into gibraltar and i was like (24:41 - 24:46)
i thought everyone knew this it was like (24:44 - 24:47)
the thing that i didn't (24:46 - 24:49)
i didn't even know there were characters (24:47 - 24:51)
in apex legends yeah yeah there's a (24:49 - 24:54)
non-binary there's a bisexual there's a (24:51 - 24:56)
gay character they got they got lore for (24:54 - 24:57)
every single character it's pretty great (24:56 - 25:00)
i thought gibraltar was an island (24:57 - 25:00)
between (25:00 - 25:03)
spain and africa that is true i didn't (25:00 - 25:04)
know that until (25:03 - 25:07)
after i learned who gibraltar was why (25:04 - 25:08)
would you know (25:07 - 25:11)
basic world geography gibraltar is a (25:08 - 25:12)
sweet name (25:11 - 25:14)
and then i was like oh wait i didn't (25:12 - 25:16)
also didn't know mozambique is like a (25:14 - 25:16)
place (25:16 - 25:19)
i just thought mozambique was a gun and (25:16 - 25:21)
i was like ah mozambique's a bad gun and (25:19 - 25:22)
then i was like (25:21 - 25:24)
look apex elections has taught me a lot (25:22 - 25:26)
the apex legends has (25:24 - 25:27)
taught me more about the world than (25:26 - 25:30)
anything that i did in mps milwaukee (25:27 - 25:31)
public schools (25:30 - 25:33)
it didn't because you thought these (25:31 - 25:35)
things were guns and people (25:33 - 25:39)
but now i know because of apex legends (25:35 - 25:41)
[Music] (25:39 - 25:45)
i this like hurts because (25:41 - 25:48)
i did my whole senior thesis in when i (25:45 - 25:49)
was graduating (25:48 - 25:52)
from university on mozambique (25:49 - 25:56)
and i can tell you (25:52 - 26:00)
so much about mozambique (25:56 - 26:02)
well let's start a new section (26:00 - 26:04)
mozambique cast (26:02 - 26:07)
that's a podcast within a podcast okay (26:04 - 26:10)
so again going back to the center is (26:07 - 26:11)
terrible it's not telling me anything (26:10 - 26:12)
about (26:11 - 26:15)
gibraltar's actual life it just says (26:12 - 26:17)
a gentle giant with a wild side that (26:15 - 26:18)
tells me nothing (26:17 - 26:20)
oh um i think it's just like apex (26:18 - 26:23)
legends.com isn't it (26:20 - 26:24)
then it shows like all the characters (26:23 - 26:25)
and you click on them and it gives you (26:24 - 26:27)
like a three paragraph summary of all of (26:25 - 26:28)
them (26:27 - 26:31)
um okay so starting in late may we plan (26:28 - 26:32)
to announce the art and content of the (26:31 - 26:33)
professor willow card (26:32 - 26:35)
and details on how the card will look in (26:33 - 26:36)
each area they didn't say cards they (26:35 - 26:38)
said card (26:36 - 26:42)
for me if each card if each willow card (26:38 - 26:44)
has different art based on like german (26:42 - 26:45)
english japanese etc (26:44 - 26:47)
i would want to actually collect them (26:45 - 26:49)
all that would be pretty cool (26:47 - 26:51)
uh but i'm going to assume they're not (26:49 - 26:52)
doing that (26:51 - 26:55)
so a card is coming to the tcg based off (26:52 - 26:56)
pokemon go so (26:55 - 27:00)
are we assuming that pokemon go is then (26:56 - 27:01)
getting something tcg (27:00 - 27:05)
based i mean it's a collaboration (27:01 - 27:08)
yeah it doesn't have to go one yeah i (27:05 - 27:10)
i actually i don't think so they could (27:08 - 27:11)
have like uh (27:10 - 27:14)
what in the tcg would come to go that (27:11 - 27:16)
would even make sense (27:14 - 27:20)

bad let's talk about some drama (30:16 - 30:24)
first i like drama where the drama came (30:21 - 30:25)
from (30:24 - 30:28)
so this was awesome (30:25 - 30:28)
also i'll talk about go canto tour (30:29 - 30:35)
due to a technical issue that occurred (30:32 - 30:36)
from the pokemon go (30:35 - 30:39)
kantho tour some trainers will be were (30:36 - 30:42)
able to access the ticketed portion of (30:39 - 30:44)
the event without purchasing a ticket we (30:42 - 30:46)
talked about this (30:44 - 30:49)
this was uh no we didn't we didn't talk (30:46 - 30:50)
about this (30:49 - 30:53)
this is news to me buddy so when we were (30:50 - 30:55)
playing the go canto tour (30:53 - 30:56)
remember when we were walking around the (30:55 - 31:00)
mall avoiding covid yeah um (30:56 - 31:02)
uh there were there was people people (31:00 - 31:04)
brought to our attention that there were (31:02 - 31:04)
some people (31:04 - 31:05)
had issues and there were going to be a (31:04 - 31:07)
makeup event right (31:05 - 31:08)
but we didn't really talk about the (31:07 - 31:10)
issues we just knew that there was going (31:08 - 31:11)
to be a makeup event like two hours (31:10 - 31:12)
i heard that there was a makeup event (31:11 - 31:14)
but i thought the issue was that it just (31:12 - 31:15)
didn't get turned on for them (31:14 - 31:17)
no they were stupid you know that people (31:15 - 31:19)
oh okay so so why (31:17 - 31:21)
so one issue was people bought tickets (31:19 - 31:23)
but they couldn't pick red or green (31:21 - 31:24)
and so they couldn't actually start the (31:23 - 31:26)
day oh (31:24 - 31:28)
i had that problem a little bit yeah (31:26 - 31:29)
they couldn't they could (31:28 - 31:31)
pick a team so they couldn't start the (31:29 - 31:32)
day until they picked a team but it (31:31 - 31:34)
wasn't letting them pick a team (31:32 - 31:35)
but i think that was only like new (31:34 - 31:38)
zealand like the first early ones (31:35 - 31:40)
the second issue was some people just (31:38 - 31:42)
had the ticket they didn't buy it or (31:40 - 31:43)
anything but they had the whole quest (31:42 - 31:44)
line (31:43 - 31:46)
everything showed up in their profile (31:44 - 31:47)
they were able to do the (31:46 - 31:50)
catch the pallet town hour the viridian (31:47 - 31:50)
hour the (31:50 - 31:52)
fuchsia hour they didn't do anything (31:50 - 31:54)
they just had it (31:52 - 31:57)
um so niantic said they're gonna do (31:54 - 31:58)
makeup event they announced what the (31:57 - 32:01)
makeup event here is um and it's not (31:58 - 32:04)
really an event uh so from friday march (32:01 - 32:04)
5th (32:04 - 32:06)
so you should have it in your game right (32:04 - 32:08)
now to monday march (32:06 - 32:12)
5th uh that's not how time works (32:08 - 32:15)
friday march 5th april oh in april (32:12 - 32:19)
not march friday march 5th to april (32:15 - 32:23)
5th uh you will have timed research and (32:19 - 32:24)
the timed research will give you 30 (32:23 - 32:25)
ultra balls (32:24 - 32:27)
one lure module one poffin one super (32:25 - 32:28)
incubator (32:27 - 32:30)
one lucky egg three pin apps one star (32:28 - 32:31)
piece one (32:30 - 32:34)
elite fast tm which i guess is pretty (32:31 - 32:35)
good one (32:34 - 32:38)
charged elite fast t it's the elite (32:35 - 32:39)
charge tm (32:38 - 32:41)
another a regular charge tm that's (32:39 - 32:43)
useless a fast tm (32:41 - 32:46)
and a hundred mew candy and (32:43 - 32:49)
you will get a bundle for three free (32:46 - 32:51)
remote raid passes (32:49 - 32:54)
in the game shop and (32:51 - 32:57)
that's it so (32:54 - 33:02)
um people were upset because (32:57 - 33:07)
they wanted an actual like time (33:02 - 33:09)
an event where they could go out for x (33:07 - 33:10)
amount of time catch pokemon (33:09 - 33:12)
and have a second chance at you know (33:10 - 33:15)
what was given to us during the canto (33:12 - 33:15)
event (33:15 - 33:17)
instead they there's giving us some (33:15 - 33:19)
items (33:17 - 33:24)
in a field research like format (33:19 - 33:25)
and there are no spawns there are no (33:24 - 33:28)
more hitmonchans in the wild or (33:25 - 33:29)
hitmonlees in the wild there's no (33:28 - 33:31)
laprases you know that's what (33:29 - 33:34)
i think from the majority of what people (33:31 - 33:34)
wanted was (33:34 - 33:36)
pokemon spawns not necessarily just (33:34 - 33:40)
items to make up for it (33:36 - 33:43)
greg you're thinking hard i'm confused (33:40 - 33:43)
as to (33:43 - 33:47)
why we're getting an a month of stuff (33:43 - 33:50)
because some people oh this is not a (33:47 - 33:52)
month of stuff i already finished the (33:50 - 33:53)
first (33:52 - 33:56)
10 research i mean i've sort of looked (33:53 - 33:57)
at it but whatever (33:56 - 34:00)
but i don't get why (33:57 - 34:01)
why because some people got access (34:00 - 34:03)
without purchasing a ticket we're (34:01 - 34:05)
getting (34:03 - 34:05)
more stuff well no it's for the people (34:05 - 34:08)
who didn't get access (34:07 - 34:10)
even though they had purchased a ticket (34:08 - 34:13)
rather than giving them a refund (34:10 - 34:14)
because that's not mentioned on their (34:13 - 34:16)
website (34:14 - 34:17)
because it says due to technicians that (34:16 - 34:19)
occurred during pokemon go to or cantos (34:17 - 34:21)
some trainers were able to access the (34:19 - 34:22)
ticketed portion of it without (34:21 - 34:24)
purchasing a ticket we apologize for (34:22 - 34:25)
this issue (34:24 - 34:26)
to help trainers who purchase a ticket (34:25 - 34:29)
feel like they're receiving its value (34:26 - 34:30)
paid ticket holders will be able to (34:29 - 34:33)
participate in a bonus event (34:30 - 34:36)
so oh so the people who (34:33 - 34:38)
didn't pay but got a ticket won't get (34:36 - 34:41)
this bonus event yeah (34:38 - 34:44)
he kind of so i i (34:41 - 34:46)
okay hold on okay so why is this even (34:44 - 34:47)
happening okay so okay (34:46 - 34:50)
so non so people who didn't spend (34:47 - 34:52)
twilight let's break this down (34:50 - 34:56)
people who didn't spend 12 got into the (34:52 - 34:57)
event (34:56 - 35:00)
for free and so not on their own accord (34:57 - 35:03)
it just it just happened right they (35:00 - 35:04)
there was no (35:03 - 35:06)
nothing malicious they just they woke up (35:04 - 35:08)
they had the event they were able to (35:06 - 35:10)
participate in it niantic wasn't going (35:08 - 35:11)
to remove it (35:10 - 35:12)
good on niantic for not removing it from (35:11 - 35:14)
these players just you you messed up (35:12 - 35:16)
niantic just give it to them they did (35:14 - 35:20)
so for whatever reason (35:16 - 35:26)
people were upset that they paid to 12 (35:20 - 35:30)
and these people over here didn't (35:26 - 35:33)
that sounds like human beings and the (35:30 - 35:34)
internet (35:33 - 35:37)
both eyes personally (35:34 - 35:38)
because we all come to the show for my (35:37 - 35:41)
opinion apparently i don't care we do (35:38 - 35:44)
those well you're all of our opinion (35:41 - 35:47)
but like if you want my opinion (35:44 - 35:49)
somebody accidentally get somebody who (35:47 - 35:51)
didn't do anything (35:49 - 35:53)
accidentally got into the event didn't (35:51 - 35:56)
ruin or affect my enjoyment of what i (35:53 - 35:57)
paid for (35:56 - 36:00)
like good on them hey they got in cool (35:57 - 36:03)
sometimes things happen in life whatever (36:00 - 36:04)
so when niantic was like we're gonna (36:03 - 36:05)
give you something (36:04 - 36:08)
because we messed up (36:05 - 36:11)
my day wasn't messed up i get that some (36:08 - 36:12)
people they had issues (36:11 - 36:14)
they couldn't connect some people (36:12 - 36:16)
couldn't log in right away some people (36:14 - 36:20)
like i can honestly say from the 12 (36:16 - 36:20)
hours (36:20 - 36:22)
i played or 10 hours i don't know how (36:20 - 36:23)
long it played (36:22 - 36:27)
um it was flaw free like i think even my (36:23 - 36:28)
app only crashed like once and i just (36:27 - 36:30)
had to swipe up and then reload and it (36:28 - 36:31)
was fine like that's just (36:30 - 36:33)
that has nothing that didn't even crash (36:31 - 36:36)
at all which is amazing (36:33 - 36:39)
so like i i can't in good conscious sit (36:36 - 36:40)
on this program or sit in front of an (36:39 - 36:41)
audience and be like (36:40 - 36:44)
man these these rewards suck their (36:41 - 36:45)
niantic (36:44 - 36:47)
owes me more because like i my event was (36:45 - 36:49)
fine like (36:47 - 36:51)
they delivered exactly what they said it (36:49 - 36:53)
was flaw free i had a good time like if (36:51 - 36:53)
they're giving (36:53 - 36:56)
giving me extra items cool but like i i (36:53 - 36:57)
have nothing to complain about the event (36:56 - 36:59)
itself was good (36:57 - 37:02)
like i can't i don't (36:59 - 37:04)
anyways so now here's the problem here's (37:02 - 37:05)
the drama (37:04 - 37:07)
well that that was drama in itself (37:05 - 37:09)
here's the second drama kataku (37:07 - 37:10)
i'm just going to read the headline it's (37:09 - 37:12)
going to explain everything (37:10 - 37:14)
pokemon go holds a makeup event for (37:12 - 37:16)
letting (37:14 - 37:20)
players without tickets sorry pokemon go (37:16 - 37:22)
makeup event for letting players without (37:20 - 37:23)
tickets (37:22 - 37:27)
lets in players without tickets (37:23 - 37:27)
so niantic pushed the makeup event to (37:28 - 37:31)
all the people who (37:30 - 37:34)
bought a ticket but all of those people (37:31 - 37:36)
that accidentally got the ticket in the (37:34 - 37:36)
first (37:36 - 37:40)
place got this event as well (37:36 - 37:44)
oh now i want a double makeup event (37:40 - 37:44)
[Applause] (37:45 - 37:50)
you'd think that (37:48 - 37:59)
[Laughter] (37:50 - 37:59)
[Music] (38:00 - 38:03)
during february's celebration of the (38:03 - 38:07)
25th anniversary pokemon go featured a (38:05 - 38:08)
pretty (38:07 - 38:10)
a pretty pricey of special event that's (38:08 - 38:12)
what kataku is saying i don't know 12 (38:10 - 38:15)
i thought was okay but i'm an adult (38:12 - 38:17)
celebrating the monsters original (38:15 - 38:19)
homeland the kanto region they charged a (38:17 - 38:21)
hefty 12 dollars to play (38:19 - 38:23)
so people found they could join without (38:21 - 38:25)
having bought a ticket others became (38:23 - 38:26)
angry (38:25 - 38:28)
niantic reacted quickly to and (38:26 - 38:30)
apologized and announced it would hold a (38:28 - 38:31)
special bonus quest (38:30 - 38:34)
chain to make it up uh that started (38:31 - 38:35)
yesterday in australia in new zealand (38:34 - 38:38)
and with just perfect script writing as (38:35 - 38:40)
eurogamer reports it was briefly (38:38 - 38:42)
available to people who haven't paid (38:40 - 38:44)
so you have to think whoever is (38:42 - 38:45)
responsible for switching on the event (38:44 - 38:47)
sat at a computer with 80 different (38:45 - 38:49)
sticky notes around their monitor that (38:47 - 38:51)
says don't make it open to everyone (38:49 - 38:53)
while various colleagues and bosses (38:51 - 38:55)
popped in their hood (38:53 - 38:56)
to say remember don't make it open to (38:55 - 38:59)
everyone then came the moment (38:56 - 39:02)
and it just went into pieces uh and then (38:59 - 39:03)
it talks about how niantics (39:02 - 39:07)
has had issues in the past (39:03 - 39:07)
the the pro okay so yeah i don't i don't (39:07 - 39:11)
know what they do at this point like do (39:10 - 39:13)
they just refund people 12 bucks do they (39:11 - 39:15)
give people a makeup event for the (39:13 - 39:16)
makeup event i (39:15 - 39:19)
i don't know they call all of these (39:16 - 39:20)
people's moms (39:19 - 39:23)
so that their moms can call them and say (39:20 - 39:25)
just because somebody else got something (39:23 - 39:27)
doesn't take away from your experience (39:25 - 39:30)
stop being a mean person just (39:27 - 39:33)
like (39:30 - 39:33)
it it clearly wasn't everybody it was (39:34 - 39:37)
just like (39:36 - 39:40)
so people got it some people got the (39:37 - 39:41)
ticket (39:40 - 39:43)
and then some people who got the ticket (39:41 - 39:45)
that was didn't buy the ticket (39:43 - 39:50)
also got the makeup event as well (39:45 - 39:50)
i mean i do i i side with the people (39:52 - 39:56)
that are like how does niantic keep (39:55 - 39:57)
messing this (39:56 - 39:59)
up i'm not sure well that's (39:57 - 40:01)
understandable i mean that that is (39:59 - 40:02)
quality control is (40:01 - 40:05)
like i know consistent like like it is (40:02 - 40:07)
frustrating when (40:05 - 40:09)
things just get shut off like there was (40:07 - 40:11)
like six months where paris wasn't even (40:09 - 40:12)
in the game anymore yeah (40:11 - 40:14)
um there was an instance you know nobody (40:12 - 40:16)
complained about that (40:14 - 40:18)
somebody didn't complain they added it (40:16 - 40:20)
back that person's literally the worst (40:18 - 40:23)
bug and grass type that exists (40:20 - 40:26)
and then like last week somebody found a (40:23 - 40:27)
shiny paris (40:26 - 40:28)
and they caught it and then it turned (40:27 - 40:31)
into a regular ditto (40:28 - 40:34)
which is frustrating um (40:31 - 40:36)
like i don't understand how you know (40:34 - 40:38)
shinies get turned off i don't (40:36 - 40:40)
understand how pokemon go missing (40:38 - 40:42)
this seems a little bit more complicated (40:40 - 40:43)
than that how are we (40:42 - 40:47)
pushing an event to people who paid when (40:43 - 40:48)
probably in the system it says that (40:47 - 40:49)
these people also i (40:48 - 40:52)
i don't know i get the frustration on (40:49 - 40:53)
that (40:52 - 40:56)
end but i i (40:53 - 40:58)
don't know what they would do to make (40:56 - 41:00)
people happy at this point and i don't (40:58 - 41:01)
know if (41:00 - 41:03)
you can right because those people are (41:01 - 41:05)
already upset that they pay 12 (41:03 - 41:07)
and somebody else didn't pay 12 and they (41:05 - 41:08)
feel like their experience is (41:07 - 41:12)
worse because they i don't know um (41:08 - 41:14)
this is the same issue i have when (41:12 - 41:15)
people say (41:14 - 41:18)
a remake ruins their childhood it's like (41:15 - 41:20)
the remake of your favorite movie (41:18 - 41:22)
did not go back in time and obliterate (41:20 - 41:23)
correct (41:22 - 41:25)
that timeline you still have that (41:23 - 41:27)
experience (41:25 - 41:29)
because somebody else got something for (41:27 - 41:31)
free (41:29 - 41:33)
okay good on them it was a fluke it's (41:31 - 41:34)
like (41:33 - 41:37)
i paid a dollar at a chance at winning (41:34 - 41:40)
the lottery i didn't win (41:37 - 41:40)
it's not a big deal somebody else (41:41 - 41:44)
sometimes went it's not a huge i (41:42 - 41:46)
the fact that people are upset and that (41:44 - 41:49)
this was deliberately to give them (41:46 - 41:53)
give us a month of makeup stuff (41:49 - 41:55)
for people who got for an unknown (41:53 - 41:57)
percentage of people (41:55 - 42:00)
who got free access to an event (41:57 - 42:04)
in error it's been five years they have (42:00 - 42:06)
added a lot to these games (42:04 - 42:10)
code gets wonky over years (42:06 - 42:13)
like something somebody wrote five years (42:10 - 42:13)
ago (42:13 - 42:15)
that somebody didn't fully understand or (42:13 - 42:17)
see or a little bit of weird code got (42:15 - 42:19)
left somewhere (42:17 - 42:21)
causes problems it just happens there's (42:19 - 42:23)
stuff that happens in mmos (42:21 - 42:26)
all the time any sort of constantly (42:23 - 42:28)
updating game where (42:26 - 42:31)
old code still exists when they add (42:28 - 42:32)
something new (42:31 - 42:35)
sometimes something breaks (42:32 - 42:38)
that is what happens it's weird to me to (42:35 - 42:39)
be (42:38 - 42:41)
upset to still learn somebody else got (42:39 - 42:43)
in for free (42:41 - 42:45)
and be like i demand this be made up (42:43 - 42:47)
well i i think the upset (42:45 - 42:51)
part is and i i i really think that it (42:47 - 42:53)
ties back to the thing that i keep (42:51 - 42:55)
saying about pokemon go (42:53 - 42:59)
is when when you're paying for a pokemon (42:55 - 43:00)
go event (42:59 - 43:02)
you're paying for the experience you're (43:00 - 43:04)
not paying for the pokemon that you (43:02 - 43:05)
catch (43:04 - 43:06)
right you're paying i mean that's how (43:05 - 43:08)
we've come to terms with (43:06 - 43:10)
how wacky and weird these events are but (43:08 - 43:12)
yes and (43:10 - 43:15)
and now it's kind of like the the (43:12 - 43:16)
related (43:15 - 43:18)
argument that the complainers are making (43:16 - 43:19)
is (43:18 - 43:23)
i was paying for exclusivity (43:19 - 43:25)
and you failed to exclude these other (43:23 - 43:26)
people (43:25 - 43:30)
right and that's just like what what a (43:26 - 43:31)
what a wrong way (43:30 - 43:35)
to think of the world honestly (43:31 - 43:37)
to go back to the first complaint of (43:35 - 43:38)
well niantic (43:37 - 43:40)
just they're just giving us a bunch of (43:38 - 43:42)
items which is funny because i (43:40 - 43:44)
i've always said on this program like (43:42 - 43:46)
like the mr mime event right (43:44 - 43:48)
if you add up the items you go like (43:46 - 43:49)
that's more than (43:48 - 43:51)
what was mr mime eight dollars like (43:49 - 43:52)
that's more than eight dollars and then (43:51 - 43:54)
greg's argument was like some people (43:52 - 43:55)
don't care about the items so that (43:54 - 43:56)
doesn't mean anything to them (43:55 - 43:57)
which is funny because they release a (43:56 - 44:00)
bunch of items and people went (43:57 - 44:01)
i don't care about the items i care (44:00 - 44:04)
about the pokemon which (44:01 - 44:06)
i kind of now see that point of like (44:04 - 44:07)
yeah those people (44:06 - 44:09)
want pokemon spawns they don't want a (44:07 - 44:11)
bunch of items that (44:09 - 44:14)
you know that as as a makeup event this (44:11 - 44:15)
choices (44:14 - 44:18)
that i agree like i don't think the the (44:15 - 44:20)
the thing that they've listed where we (44:18 - 44:22)
get items (44:20 - 44:26)
makes up for having (44:22 - 44:29)
those spawns who are only supposed to (44:26 - 44:31)
spawn for me (44:29 - 44:34)
although but like we're putting weird we (44:31 - 44:36)
put weird values on chinese anyways (44:34 - 44:40)
like i i get i get like (44:36 - 44:41)
that i get the complaint that there's a (44:40 - 44:43)
weird disconnect that a month (44:41 - 44:44)
that's just giving me a bunch of items (44:43 - 44:46)
that i probably won't use (44:44 - 44:49)
doesn't make up for the fact that i was (44:46 - 44:51)
supposed to get access to these limited (44:49 - 44:52)
things (44:51 - 44:54)
where it falls apart is i still got (44:52 - 44:56)
access to those limited things (44:54 - 44:59)
for the appropriate amount of time but (44:56 - 45:01)
i will tell you this a lawyer and an (44:59 - 45:04)
accountant got into a room together (45:01 - 45:07)
and said how do we (45:04 - 45:10)
provide sufficient monetary value so (45:07 - 45:12)
that when somebody sues us for not (45:10 - 45:14)
making this exclusive event exclusive we (45:12 - 45:15)
can say (45:14 - 45:18)
we actually actually compensated you (45:15 - 45:20)
with monetary value pokemon in pokemon (45:18 - 45:21)
go strangely enough (45:20 - 45:24)
have zero monetary value items (45:21 - 45:27)
that you can purchase in the shop have a (45:24 - 45:29)
designated monetary value (45:27 - 45:30)
well the other problem is they can now (45:29 - 45:32)
say we gave you the opportunity (45:30 - 45:35)
to get twenty dollars worth of items (45:32 - 45:36)
yeah for your twelve dollar ticket (45:35 - 45:39)
yeah yeah there might be legal implic (45:36 - 45:40)
implications i mean there (45:39 - 45:43)
there's not might be there are legal (45:40 - 45:45)
implications for that (45:43 - 45:46)
there's there's no might in that whole (45:45 - 45:49)
thing um legally (45:46 - 45:51)
if they're going to make it up they do (45:49 - 45:53)
have to do something that they (45:51 - 45:56)
can avoid getting sued over through (45:53 - 45:57)
weird closets (45:56 - 45:58)
yeah i would be in the camp where i (45:57 - 46:00)
would want like a three-hour event they (45:58 - 46:01)
did this for (46:00 - 46:03)
the go fest right they were like okay we (46:01 - 46:05)
messed up go fest here's a three-hour (46:03 - 46:07)
saturday event the problem with that (46:05 - 46:07)
though (46:07 - 46:11)
is people can't (46:07 - 46:13)
make that event even if even if you say (46:11 - 46:14)
the event is a month out (46:13 - 46:16)
some people can't get off work they (46:14 - 46:18)
might be traveling a family thing might (46:16 - 46:19)
come up and then you get the compliance (46:18 - 46:21)
of like well they did a makeup event but (46:19 - 46:21)
i couldn't do it (46:21 - 46:24)
or they do the makeup event and you know (46:21 - 46:26)
rng is rng and they go well i did the (46:24 - 46:27)
three-hour makeup event and i didn't get (46:26 - 46:28)
a single shiny (46:27 - 46:31)
so it was completely worthless like this (46:28 - 46:34)
everyone is getting the same rewards in (46:31 - 46:36)
the and in this instance (46:34 - 46:38)
but i do agree with people that like i (46:36 - 46:41)
really did expect (46:38 - 46:43)
like three hours of spawns like i did (46:41 - 46:45)
expect that but (46:43 - 46:47)
we got a bunch of items but also again (46:45 - 46:49)
going back to my start (46:47 - 46:51)
uh that was fine for me i didn't have (46:49 - 46:52)
any issues i (46:51 - 46:54)
i'm not a person to complain but if you (46:52 - 46:56)
had a if you were one of those people (46:54 - 46:57)
where like half the day the game didn't (46:56 - 46:58)
work (46:57 - 47:01)
i do feel bad for you because that sucks (46:58 - 47:04)
it really really sucks that like you (47:01 - 47:05)
spent 12 bucks and (47:04 - 47:07)
you couldn't even play some of the event (47:05 - 47:09)
like that is unfortunate and i (47:07 - 47:11)
like i wish that i think it was a valid (47:09 - 47:13)
that that i think is valid (47:11 - 47:15)
like if you were barred from the thing (47:13 - 47:16)
that you purchased (47:15 - 47:20)
you should either get a refund or (47:16 - 47:24)
something to actually make up the day (47:20 - 47:26)
depending on how it blocked you out like (47:24 - 47:28)
how long were you locked out (47:26 - 47:31)
how long like could you just not play at (47:28 - 47:32)
all (47:31 - 47:35)
i mean there are issues with timing and (47:32 - 47:39)
whatever um i mean at this point niantic (47:35 - 47:39)
should just give (47:39 - 47:42)
everyone who bought a ticket like 1200 (47:39 - 47:43)
coins or whatever (47:42 - 47:45)
just deposit they did this for the first (47:43 - 47:47)
go fest well they gave everyone 100 (47:45 - 47:50)
worth of coins but at this point like (47:47 - 47:52)
just give people 1200 worth of coins let (47:50 - 47:53)
them buy incense or (47:52 - 47:56)
lucky eggs or incubators like (47:53 - 47:58)
because they can't is there anything (47:56 - 47:59)
they can't do another event on top and (47:58 - 48:01)
they can't do an event right for a (47:59 - 48:02)
makeup event and then do another makeup (48:01 - 48:04)
event just give people coins (48:02 - 48:08)
is there anything in this list (48:04 - 48:11)
that you can't buy in the store the at (48:08 - 48:13)
least the mew candy (48:11 - 48:15)
you can't you can't buy the mew candy (48:13 - 48:16)
you can't buy silver pin apps (48:15 - 48:20)
you cannot buy um ultra balls (48:16 - 48:23)
you can't buy um charged tv ultra balls (48:20 - 48:27)
no i don't think so you can't (48:23 - 48:30)
you can get them in the boxes like the (48:27 - 48:30)
free box (48:30 - 48:31)
maybe that's what i'm thinking about (48:30 - 48:34)
okay um you can't buy charge tms or (48:31 - 48:36)
fast charge tms but those come from (48:34 - 48:38)
raids the thing that is actually of (48:36 - 48:39)
value here (48:38 - 48:42)
and of value is (48:39 - 48:42)
depending on how you play dubious yes is (48:43 - 48:48)
the elite fast and elite charge tms (48:46 - 48:50)
those are only available at high levels (48:48 - 48:51)
of go battle league (48:50 - 48:53)
and those are only available during (48:51 - 48:55)
community days (48:53 - 48:57)
where you spend the 12 on that community (48:55 - 48:59)
day scam box (48:57 - 49:00)
and they're only available like once a (48:59 - 49:03)
month to buy and they're minimum like 12 (49:00 - 49:04)
bucks (49:03 - 49:08)
and they're pretty rare (49:04 - 49:08)
i mean that's interesting as far as (49:08 - 49:13)
how they've decided to make this up (49:11 - 49:15)
because (49:13 - 49:18)
as i mean i get it as much as they would (49:15 - 49:20)
love to turn (49:18 - 49:23)
on shinies for a day i'm sure it's not (49:20 - 49:25)
that simple because they have to get (49:23 - 49:26)
clearance and they have to do all the (49:25 - 49:29)
things and look at community days (49:26 - 49:32)
this at least i mean like the list (49:29 - 49:37)
i'm sure this is this is more (49:32 - 49:37)
this would cost you more in the store (49:37 - 49:41)
plus (49:40 - 49:44)
time than the 12 cost you for the event (49:41 - 49:47)
like in that yeah and that viewpoint (49:44 - 49:48)
these (49:47 - 49:51)
these rewards make sense the elite fast (49:48 - 49:53)
and the elite charge is (49:51 - 49:55)
in itself is one of those is worth like (49:53 - 49:57)
the 12 bucks and they're giving you two (49:55 - 49:57)
technically (49:57 - 49:59)
theoretically i mean they're covering (49:57 - 50:01)
they're covering their bases (49:59 - 50:04)
i i get the complaints that it would be (50:01 - 50:06)
better to be able to access the shinies (50:04 - 50:07)
that should have happened during that (50:06 - 50:09)
day (50:07 - 50:11)
i i could see the only way i could see (50:09 - 50:13)
around this is just saying they would (50:11 - 50:16)
turn those shinies on and have them (50:13 - 50:17)
spawn (50:16 - 50:19)
at normal odds throughout this month and (50:17 - 50:20)
just say (50:19 - 50:23)
good luck you have a month to find them (50:20 - 50:24)
but (50:23 - 50:25)
i mean there are people who are never (50:24 - 50:27)
gonna find them but (50:25 - 50:30)
at least that could be a way to sort of (50:27 - 50:30)
negate (50:30 - 50:34)
the i did get my pokemon like you you (50:30 - 50:36)
have a month to try to find them (50:34 - 50:37)
so if it's really really important to (50:36 - 50:40)
use your own time to hunt them down (50:37 - 50:43)
um but like these rewards at least (50:40 - 50:47)
make up for the cost of that ticket (50:43 - 50:49)
i mean granted provided the people who (50:47 - 50:51)
didn't get the ticket (50:49 - 50:52)
are also not getting these but like (50:51 - 50:54)
that's a whole separate issue yeah (50:52 - 50:57)
like there's just that's just it's it's (50:54 - 50:57)
just (50:57 - 51:00)
a buggy code thing um (50:57 - 51:03)
this whole thing is just weird i i mean (51:00 - 51:05)
i i don't hate the items (51:03 - 51:07)
i go i'll eventually do it this month (51:05 - 51:09)
i'm sure i wasn't even aware it was (51:07 - 51:10)
happening until i looked at my page i'm (51:09 - 51:11)
like (51:10 - 51:15)
why is this a thing why are these uh (51:11 - 51:18)
why am i getting new events i did well (51:15 - 51:20)
and also the fact that we haven't been (51:18 - 51:20)
receiving (51:20 - 51:23)
news alerts yeah at all for like a (51:20 - 51:24)
couple of weeks (51:23 - 51:27)
my newsletters have all been code and (51:24 - 51:30)
code i don't understand (51:27 - 51:30)
yeah well we'll find out probably (51:31 - 51:38)
next week what they do to rectify this i (51:34 - 51:39)
guess (51:38 - 51:42)
um there's nothing to do (51:39 - 51:45)
here's the thing you're never going to (51:42 - 51:47)
be happy with somebody's solution (51:45 - 51:50)
period yeah like there are always going (51:47 - 51:51)
to be people who are fine with it and (51:50 - 51:52)
there's always going to be people who (51:51 - 51:53)
are (51:52 - 51:56)
unhappy about it the only person that (51:53 - 51:57)
can close (51:56 - 52:00)
the gap is you so (51:57 - 52:02)
figure out how you make peace with the (52:00 - 52:04)
solution that they came up with (52:02 - 52:07)
because they have a set of criteria that (52:04 - 52:09)
one they're never going to tell you (52:07 - 52:11)
about because they're a corporation (52:09 - 52:13)
two that their legal team is never going (52:11 - 52:16)
to allow them to tell you about (52:13 - 52:18)
because they don't want to get sued and (52:16 - 52:19)
three (52:18 - 52:22)
is hitting as many points as they feel (52:19 - 52:23)
they need to cover (52:22 - 52:26)
both legally and as a corporate good (52:23 - 52:27)
name-wise (52:26 - 52:29)
without breaking the bank without (52:27 - 52:33)
setting weird precedent (52:29 - 52:37)
welcome to corporations and capitalism (52:33 - 52:39)
shake hands with it this is the bed (52:37 - 52:41)
we're sleeping in (52:39 - 52:44)
walk across the bridge also stop (52:41 - 52:47)
bringing agrons to raids i don't want to (52:44 - 52:48)
see your egg right (52:47 - 52:50)
it's one of my best pokemon in a raid (52:48 - 52:51)
what about my (52:50 - 52:54)
mega aggro yeah yeah fine good (52:51 - 52:57)
yeah bring that i don't know just before (52:54 - 52:58)
we go to break (52:57 - 53:02)
psa i've done five to six maybe ten (52:58 - 53:03)
tornadoes (53:02 - 53:05)
i have seen some wild pokemon being (53:03 - 53:06)
brought to tornadoes i saw somebody (53:05 - 53:08)
bring a tauros (53:06 - 53:11)
i saw somebody bring a dodrio i've (53:08 - 53:14)
seen people bring lugia tornadoes is (53:11 - 53:16)
just a flying type pokemon (53:14 - 53:19)
it's weak to rock it's weak to electric (53:16 - 53:20)
it's weak to (53:19 - 53:24)
ice what i'm maybe sure that that tauros (53:20 - 53:25)
has like wild charge (53:24 - 53:28)
i am confident though i am so confident (53:25 - 53:31)
that you probably have an electric type (53:28 - 53:32)
pokemon (53:31 - 53:34)
with electric type moves that you can (53:32 - 53:36)
bring over that tauros (53:34 - 53:38)
i don't understand pokemon go you have (53:36 - 53:39)
become that guy (53:38 - 53:42)
i go to the raid pokemon go picks six (53:39 - 53:46)
and says use these six and those are the (53:42 - 53:46)
six that i use (53:46 - 53:49)
because (53:46 - 53:49)
look i got you in these two situations (53:50 - 53:54)
where i saw these like (53:52 - 53:57)
that when i saw these lugias and i saw (53:54 - 53:58)
these tauros (53:57 - 54:01)
we were in a raid with four me the (53:58 - 54:02)
person who invited me (54:01 - 54:04)
and then in both instances there were (54:02 - 54:05)
different people who invited me i'm not (54:04 - 54:06)
gonna name any names (54:05 - 54:08)
but when somebody invites me to a raid (54:06 - 54:10)
and go i think you know me (54:08 - 54:13)
i'm sporting a mega ampharos right now (54:10 - 54:15)
you better believe i'm showing this bad (54:13 - 54:16)
boy off (54:15 - 54:18)
i join i see there's three other people (54:16 - 54:19)
i go okay (54:18 - 54:21)
that's all right we can do it with four (54:19 - 54:23)
two of those people (54:21 - 54:26)
in both the raids we're 25. (54:23 - 54:28)
we're we're we're working with low-level (54:26 - 54:29)
people here that's fine (54:28 - 54:31)
why are you even playing pokemon go with (54:29 - 54:33)
anybody who's under level 40. it's true (54:31 - 54:35)
that's very true i graced my presence (54:33 - 54:37)
with my mega ampharos (54:35 - 54:40)
um look we (54:37 - 54:42)
both raids went to like 10 seconds left (54:40 - 54:44)
which is fine we were able to do my boy (54:42 - 54:45)
my boy ampharos carried (54:44 - 54:50)
they great but this is this is the (54:45 - 54:52)
this is the the problem which i've (54:50 - 54:53)
always talked about my twitch stream (54:52 - 54:54)
where people (54:53 - 54:56)
don't evolve or they power up pokemon (54:54 - 54:57)
because they are (54:56 - 55:00)
under this mindset like oh the people at (54:57 - 55:01)
the raid told me (55:00 - 55:03)
not to evolve uh anything that isn't a (55:01 - 55:04)
98 (55:03 - 55:07)
or a higher geodude no look the kanto (55:04 - 55:09)
event just happened (55:07 - 55:11)
you probably caught a million geodudes (55:09 - 55:14)
literally whatever the highest cp one is (55:11 - 55:15)
evolve it you don't have to spend any (55:14 - 55:17)
extra stardust any just evolve the (55:15 - 55:19)
highest cp one (55:17 - 55:22)
you'll have a beefy chunky (55:19 - 55:24)
graveler whatever graveler evolves into (55:22 - 55:25)
golem (55:24 - 55:27)
you'll have a beefy chunky golem that (55:25 - 55:29)
will be great against tornadoes you (55:27 - 55:30)
don't have to spend any stardust you (55:29 - 55:31)
don't have to worry about ivs (55:30 - 55:34)
just in a situation if you're thinking (55:31 - 55:35)
to yourself (55:34 - 55:37)
i'm gonna do a couple tornadoes or what (55:35 - 55:38)
what's after tornadoes thunderous i'm (55:37 - 55:40)
gonna do a couple thunderous (55:38 - 55:43)
just evolve your highest cp1 you'll have (55:40 - 55:44)
good rate counters (55:43 - 55:47)
and then down the line when you have a (55:44 - 55:49)
bunch of stardust and a bunch of candy (55:47 - 55:52)
then you can evolve your 98 uh (55:49 - 55:56)
perfect attack geodude but (55:52 - 55:59)
i am frustrated because you're bringing (55:56 - 56:01)
tauros to a raid and you're probably (55:59 - 56:02)
frustrated (56:01 - 56:05)
because you're not doing a lot of damage (56:02 - 56:06)
and i get this all the time where people (56:05 - 56:07)
are like (56:06 - 56:08)
i don't i don't like to join raids i (56:07 - 56:09)
feel embarrassed i don't have anything (56:08 - 56:10)
good (56:09 - 56:11)
yeah you're right you don't have (56:10 - 56:12)
anything good you got thoros evolve a (56:11 - 56:14)
geodude it's fine (56:12 - 56:16)
you know rock is weak you know flying's (56:14 - 56:17)
weak to rock (56:16 - 56:19)
but all of this time people are so (56:17 - 56:21)
scared to evolve pokemon because of this (56:19 - 56:22)
mindset that (56:21 - 56:24)
has existed in pogo just evolve just (56:22 - 56:26)
catch a high cp one (56:24 - 56:29)
evolve it use it it's fine it'll work (56:26 - 56:30)
it's good (56:29 - 56:31)
you'll be able to go through raids (56:30 - 56:33)
faster no one's gonna no one no one (56:31 - 56:34)
knows (56:33 - 56:36)
when they see your geodude when they see (56:34 - 56:38)
your golem whether it's perfect or not (56:36 - 56:39)
but they'll be like at least they (56:38 - 56:41)
brought the right counter (56:39 - 56:44)
not a tauros (56:41 - 56:47)
people think about this stuff way too (56:44 - 56:48)
much (56:47 - 56:50)
barely notice what the other things are (56:48 - 56:52)
in the ring 100 (56:50 - 56:54)
because i am not looking at my phone i (56:52 - 56:56)
am literally tapping my thumb (56:54 - 56:58)
over the button until it's done look if (56:56 - 56:59)
there's 20 people (56:58 - 57:02)
i just love people who go to raids uh (56:59 - 57:04)
and i'm pretty sure there's people (57:02 - 57:06)
in this conversation right now who are (57:04 - 57:08)
in that set who don't even like try to (57:06 - 57:08)
hit (57:08 - 57:11)
the like big attack button they just (57:08 - 57:13)
like tap everywhere else on the screen (57:11 - 57:15)
except for the big attack button and i'm (57:13 - 57:17)
like i only tap the big attack button (57:15 - 57:19)
because i want it to go (57:17 - 57:22)
off the second it's available you are in (57:19 - 57:22)
a raid with (57:22 - 57:25)
20 people by all means bring sixth (57:22 - 57:26)
antler (57:25 - 57:29)
i encourage it it'll be fine if all 20 (57:26 - 57:30)
people brought (57:29 - 57:32)
six stantler each i guarantee you the (57:30 - 57:34)
raid will be able to be complete (57:32 - 57:36)
i'm just saying when there's only four (57:34 - 57:38)
people and we're down to timer (57:36 - 57:39)
i don't want to see that tauros or that (57:38 - 57:42)
egg around across me (57:39 - 57:43)
maybe they already went through their (57:42 - 57:45)
golem and they're down to what they (57:43 - 57:48)
didn't they started with a loop and (57:45 - 57:50)
lugia is not even super effective (57:48 - 57:51)
against tornadoes i mean (57:50 - 57:53)
look at you taking notes on other (57:51 - 57:56)
people's business (57:53 - 57:58)
playing with you because the reason i (57:56 - 58:00)
took notes is because i had to actually (57:58 - 58:02)
look at the video game to play it (58:00 - 58:04)
normally i'm just like tap tap tap tap (58:02 - 58:06)
tap we're good i'll see you guys in 60 (58:04 - 58:07)
seconds when it's over (58:06 - 58:09)
i'm gonna look ahead in this instance (58:07 - 58:11)
i'm like i have to optimize (58:09 - 58:12)
i'm gonna wipe right here i'm gonna end (58:11 - 58:14)
the game early i gotta revive (58:12 - 58:17)
six get back in uh that's fine (58:14 - 58:20)
look if you need pogo help let let me (58:17 - 58:21)
know in the (58:20 - 58:23)
in the discord or the slack i'll help (58:21 - 58:27)

the gym with no dynamics (62:16 - 62:22)
the rule is you can't dynamax in this in (62:19 - 62:23)
this online competition (62:22 - 62:26)
so unfortunately as it turns out it's (62:23 - 62:28)
singles not doubles (62:26 - 62:30)

battle points for participating (62:44 - 62:47)
no shirt or anything just 50 battle (62:45 - 62:49)
points i'm out the whole gimmick (62:47 - 62:52)
is you don't dynamics i saw some people (62:49 - 62:53)
being like (62:52 - 62:55)
oh they're listening to us we hate (62:53 - 62:56)
dynamaxx (62:55 - 62:58)
first off that's a small majority of (62:56 - 63:00)
people secondly that's the majority of (62:58 - 63:00)
people (63:00 - 63:03)
third (63:00 - 63:03)
um thirdly did they not play the game (63:05 - 63:10)
do they not did they not just re like i (63:08 - 63:12)
instantly little and i saw (63:10 - 63:15)
the title spike month cup i the first (63:12 - 63:16)
thing i thought was oh this is going to (63:15 - 63:18)
be no dynamics because that is the whole (63:16 - 63:20)
gimmick of his gym (63:18 - 63:24)
yes is he doesn't believe in dynamics (63:20 - 63:26)
the talking about minorities and (63:24 - 63:27)
majorities (63:26 - 63:31)
the majority of competitive vgc players (63:27 - 63:34)
play enough of the game to the point (63:31 - 63:35)
where they can do everything they need (63:34 - 63:37)
to do to get their vgc team (63:35 - 63:40)
and then stop playing which is probably (63:37 - 63:42)
gym number three (63:40 - 63:45)
so they never got to spikeness you're (63:42 - 63:46)
right (63:45 - 63:49)
no the uh i feel like yeah maybe (63:46 - 63:51)
probably gym three actually (63:49 - 63:53)
maybe jim like one maybe they don't even (63:51 - 63:55)
need to get to a gym i i (63:53 - 63:57)
well willa said a lot of competitive (63:55 - 63:59)
players will just (63:57 - 64:00)
get to the point of the game where they (63:59 - 64:02)
can build up daycare's right after that (64:00 - 64:03)
first gym (64:02 - 64:07)
so you i mean you would get (64:03 - 64:07)
yeah you would have to get past the (64:07 - 64:10)
first ship you'd have to get past milo (64:09 - 64:13)
to get to (64:10 - 64:14)
the majority of competitive players (64:13 - 64:17)
aren't even breeding their own pokemon (64:14 - 64:20)
true look true cheer look look give them (64:17 - 64:21)
give some of them the benefit of the (64:20 - 64:24)
doubt (64:21 - 64:24)
okay yeah sure um (64:24 - 64:31)
i was excited well i'm not excited (64:28 - 64:32)
singles i was excited they were doing (64:31 - 64:34)
this just because i do like weird (64:32 - 64:37)
dynamac i do like weird battle formats (64:34 - 64:39)
like they did us back in ultrasound (64:37 - 64:41)
ultramoon they did like a spooky cup you (64:39 - 64:41)
were all (64:41 - 64:43)
allowed to use like ghost type pokemon (64:41 - 64:45)
and that was really cool (64:43 - 64:47)
uh and they've kind of been even though (64:45 - 64:49)
they've been really good at like (64:47 - 64:53)
changing the rules every season um (64:49 - 64:55)
and putting out these competitions which (64:53 - 64:56)
you know and this is the first time we (64:55 - 64:57)
had a (64:56 - 64:59)
we have had a real change in like every (64:57 - 65:01)
whatever two three months (64:59 - 65:04)
because we're on rule we're on eight (65:01 - 65:07)
the rule version eight uh (65:04 - 65:09)
and the game's been out a little over a (65:07 - 65:11)
year (65:09 - 65:11)
this just like they kind of there's not (65:13 - 65:16)
been anything (65:16 - 65:18)
zany or wacky (65:16 - 65:20)
[Laughter] (65:18 - 65:22)
like give me only grass pokemon or give (65:20 - 65:24)
me only (65:22 - 65:28)
a lowland slash galleria forums or (65:24 - 65:31)
that one competition where it was like (65:28 - 65:32)
you had to have a pikachu (65:31 - 65:34)
on your team or it was like all electric (65:32 - 65:35)
types (65:34 - 65:38)
competition this was a long time ago (65:35 - 65:41)
because i was still living in dc (65:38 - 65:43)
so i don't remember that one i feel like (65:41 - 65:44)
there was like a holiday one where it (65:43 - 65:46)
was like you're allowed to do (65:44 - 65:48)
like deliberate and stantler and jinx (65:46 - 65:50)
and pikachu (65:48 - 65:53)
and cherubi (65:50 - 65:56)
pikachu is for every yeah event (65:53 - 65:58)
uh pikachu is forever every holiday is a (65:56 - 66:02)
pikachu holiday if you try hard enough (65:58 - 66:04)
i felt like there was like one didn't (66:02 - 66:06)
they do one where it was like pokemon (66:04 - 66:08)
standing on all fours (66:06 - 66:10)
am i imagining this where like they had (66:08 - 66:12)
to be like no that sounds familiar (66:10 - 66:14)
where like they couldn't be bipedal they (66:12 - 66:16)
had to just be on like all four legs (66:14 - 66:20)
i don't remember i pedal bipedal (66:16 - 66:21)
doesn't matter okay i know what you're (66:20 - 66:24)
trying to say (66:21 - 66:24)
that's all the news i'm actually very (66:26 - 66:30)
sure we're missing something (66:28 - 66:31)
it's been a long week i mean i looked (66:30 - 66:33)
around i'm not seeing much (66:31 - 66:35)
we can talk about masters if we really (66:33 - 66:37)
wanted oh yeah we are missing masters uh (66:35 - 66:39)
yeah there's not a lot to talk about (66:37 - 66:41)
leon is in the game (66:39 - 66:44)
you pulled leon i did (66:41 - 66:48)
i did too well congrats i have not (66:44 - 66:51)
called marnie marnie has eaten all of my (66:48 - 66:52)
gems (66:51 - 66:56)
i got leon in my first set and then (66:52 - 66:58)
uh still no marty and marnie's at two (66:56 - 66:59)
percent (66:58 - 67:02)
uh leanne is what (66:59 - 67:05)
literally the most overpowered pair they (67:02 - 67:07)
put in the game (67:05 - 67:10)
leon yeah i think red is still (67:07 - 67:13)
better i think so what happens when you (67:10 - 67:15)
dynamics charizard because that was the (67:13 - 67:16)
big (67:15 - 67:18)
question last week nothing yeah okay so (67:16 - 67:21)
dynamaxx isn't in the game yet (67:18 - 67:22)
uh they said they were gonna have that (67:21 - 67:25)
happens they okay yeah you when you use (67:22 - 67:26)
the sync move which is (67:25 - 67:30)
ultimately like a z move um (67:26 - 67:33)
it does the explosion exploding (67:30 - 67:35)
animation but there is no dynamics (67:33 - 67:37)
i believe they talked they said that (67:35 - 67:39)
dynamics is coming right this is not (67:37 - 67:42)
a pipe dream of mine for full disclosure (67:39 - 67:44)
i am partnered with dna so i do know (67:42 - 67:47)
that some some stuff you would know more (67:44 - 67:47)
than i (67:47 - 67:49)
yeah but i don't know what i'm allowed (67:47 - 67:51)
to say and not say i'm pretty sure they (67:49 - 67:54)
said dynamics is coming (67:51 - 67:54)
i'm pretty sure we all filled out a (67:54 - 67:58)
survey that said that (67:56 - 68:02)
we want dynamaxx and dynamics is coming (67:58 - 68:02)
i mean that's i don't know where leon (68:03 - 68:07)
falls in the actual power (68:05 - 68:09)
power list he's number two i believe (68:07 - 68:10)
grid (68:09 - 68:14)
uh so the top two are are charizard (68:10 - 68:16)
put them both on your team char it up (68:14 - 68:18)
you can technically have (68:16 - 68:20)
three charizards if you want because you (68:18 - 68:23)
can get a charizard from the egg (68:20 - 68:25)
and you can assign it but then who is it (68:23 - 68:27)
partnered with okay you just pick (68:25 - 68:29)
who you partner with you partner with (68:27 - 68:31)
yourself (68:29 - 68:33)
yeah you partner with your main (68:31 - 68:35)
character (68:33 - 68:35)
yeah they did say this okay sweating for (68:35 - 68:40)
a second (68:38 - 68:40)
okay this is uh this is really expecting (68:41 - 68:46)
i always say this i was really expecting (68:44 - 68:50)
when i used sync when i would sync move (68:46 - 68:54)
leon for dynamaxx what i would see the (68:50 - 68:56)
dynamics thing and it would cut back to (68:54 - 68:57)
the three pairs and we would just (68:56 - 68:59)
see charizard's giant foot and nothing (68:57 - 69:01)
else on screen (68:59 - 69:04)
that was my wish that did not happen i (69:01 - 69:04)
was (69:04 - 69:08)
very disappointed in this game (69:04 - 69:08)
okay this is uh this is from january (69:11 - 69:15)
14th (69:14 - 69:18)
dynamaxx in development for our two year (69:15 - 69:20)
anniversary we're working to bring you (69:18 - 69:22)
to bring you battles that have dynamax (69:20 - 69:24)
pokemon with this feature we hope to (69:22 - 69:26)
provide a new way for players to enjoy (69:24 - 69:28)
battles for more details (69:26 - 69:30)
it'll be available at a later date so (69:28 - 69:32)
stay tuned so they they did say that (69:30 - 69:36)
um there's like no one no one (69:32 - 69:38)
in the entire world would not think that (69:36 - 69:40)
leon charizard wouldn't be the first (69:38 - 69:43)
pair to dynamax (69:40 - 69:43)
like like they're not gonna put leon (69:44 - 69:48)
into the game and be like uh well we (69:47 - 69:50)
gave him charizard but also he can't (69:48 - 69:50)
dynam (69:50 - 69:53)
like he is going to be able to dynamex (69:50 - 69:55)
um and that would make his charizard (69:53 - 69:56)
different than reds charizard because (69:55 - 69:59)
red's charizard can mega evolve (69:56 - 70:02)
um and your charizard can your if you (69:59 - 70:04)
get an egg charizard (70:02 - 70:07)
that cannot mega evolve or dynamics it's (70:04 - 70:09)
just can it z move (70:07 - 70:11)
well yeah well when you use the z move (70:09 - 70:13)
in masters that's what mega evolves you (70:11 - 70:15)
so you do the move and then you make (70:13 - 70:17)
evolve after them yes (70:15 - 70:22)
you sync move the sync move (70:17 - 70:22)
uh there's some cool events going on (70:26 - 70:29)
masters right now there's the the yell (70:27 - 70:29)
event (70:29 - 70:33)
which is pretty okay you can get yeah um (70:29 - 70:35)
and then there's the champion event yeah (70:33 - 70:37)
the champion event (70:35 - 70:39)
with this with the going through the map (70:37 - 70:41)
although (70:39 - 70:43)
i felt like the first half of the (70:41 - 70:45)
storyline for the champion event was (70:43 - 70:46)
good and then they were just like (70:45 - 70:49)
we have eight more things to fill in for (70:46 - 70:50)
conversations (70:49 - 70:54)
so let's just have people talk to each (70:50 - 70:55)
other (70:54 - 70:58)

that is currently my favorite (71:12 - 71:18)
conversation (71:16 - 71:21)
in the game they have a very good (71:18 - 71:24)
conversation about a very very important (71:21 - 71:26)
topic to two of them (71:24 - 71:31)

blissful (72:11 - 72:14)
bonanza it's coming back it's where you (72:12 - 72:16)

and then you get lucky tickets to like (72:27 - 72:31)
change your skills (72:28 - 72:31)
oh it's just to get the lucky cookies (72:32 - 72:36)
right yeah yeah yeah yeah the lucky (72:34 - 72:37)
cookies cause the lucky cookies are (72:36 - 72:38)
random (72:37 - 72:40)
yeah but you you but the blissey gives (72:38 - 72:42)
you a ton of them (72:40 - 72:44)
and then you spend you spend your rng (72:42 - 72:46)
re-rolling your abilities and then (72:44 - 72:47)
you spend them all and then you go i (72:46 - 72:48)
didn't get the good one so i guess i'll (72:47 - 72:50)
wait for the next [ __ ] banana what are (72:48 - 72:51)
the good ones (72:50 - 72:54)
i don't know like like a lot of people (72:51 - 72:54)
like um (72:54 - 72:56)
gosh i can't remember what it's called (72:54 - 72:58)
on stephen but it's it's it's something (72:56 - 72:59)
where (72:58 - 73:01)
you get health back depending on damage (72:59 - 73:04)
you do cause metagross metagross has no (73:01 - 73:05)
recovery (73:04 - 73:08)
so when you but but metagross has high (73:05 - 73:09)
flinch (73:08 - 73:11)
so you like flinched all of them and (73:09 - 73:12)
then you get health back that's really (73:11 - 73:13)
good (73:12 - 73:14)
i can't remember what ability that's (73:13 - 73:16)
called (73:14 - 73:16)
uh and then finally we're adjusting your (73:17 - 73:21)
sync pair grids to be (73:20 - 73:23)
easier than ever players will (73:21 - 73:25)
automatically be able to convert (73:23 - 73:26)
co-op sync orbs that's because they (73:25 - 73:28)
don't do co-op anymore (73:26 - 73:30)
create present synchroid builds and (73:28 - 73:31)
reset (73:30 - 73:33)
individual tiles instead of in resetting (73:31 - 73:34)
your entire sync grid (73:33 - 73:36)
these new features are available in the (73:34 - 73:38)
upcoming select multiple feature (73:36 - 73:40)
that will let players allow multiple (73:38 - 73:43)
sync grids at a time (73:40 - 73:43)
and then they yeah so that's (73:45 - 73:48)
iris is coming diantha is coming dynomax (73:49 - 73:53)
is coming (73:51 - 73:55)
i don't know i think pogba masters is (73:53 - 73:56)
still what it is (73:55 - 73:58)
if you haven't tried it probably a good (73:56 - 74:00)
time to log in because there's a bunch (73:58 - 74:00)
of (74:00 - 74:02)
free gems if you have tried it and you (74:00 - 74:05)
didn't like it (74:02 - 74:06)
probably this update's not going to (74:05 - 74:08)
convince you (74:06 - 74:11)
it's still the same game now we'll see (74:08 - 74:16)
how we'll see how much dynamics changes (74:11 - 74:16)

it's gonna be the one where you schooled (75:15 - 75:19)
all the kids at the mall of america (75:16 - 75:21)

to be on my list of like favorite things (76:57 - 76:59)
i did (76:59 - 77:03)
i got a bunch of my co-workers this (76:59 - 77:05)
you know the moment where you like you (77:03 - 77:07)
know the moment in pokemon where (77:05 - 77:09)
you are out of pokemon and you want to (77:07 - 77:10)
get back into pokemon but you have to (77:09 - 77:12)
like convince somebody else to get into (77:10 - 77:13)
pokemon with you (77:12 - 77:15)
this is like this is like somebody (77:13 - 77:16)
somebody listening to this would be like (77:15 - 77:17)

secretly both know that pokemon wasn't (77:28 - 77:31)
lame it was just like (77:30 - 77:32)
right you needed that person to go to (77:31 - 77:34)
the bathroom with you that kind of (77:32 - 77:35)
situation (77:34 - 77:38)
um okay sure (77:35 - 77:42)
no no okay so like that that's what (77:38 - 77:42)
happened (77:42 - 77:44)
with my co-workers when black and white (77:42 - 77:46)
came out because i was already into (77:44 - 77:47)
pokemon i was already doing a pokemon (77:46 - 77:49)
podcast at the time (77:47 - 77:52)
and then they were like kind of kind of (77:49 - 77:53)
getting into pokemon they were like (77:52 - 77:55)
getting interested because black and (77:53 - 77:56)
white was very new (77:55 - 77:57)
and it appealed to a lot of people that (77:56 - 77:59)
you know haven't played pokemon in a (77:57 - 77:59)
while (77:59 - 78:02)
and i i i wouldn't say i (77:59 - 78:05)
alone convinced them but together as a (78:02 - 78:06)
group not only did i (78:05 - 78:08)
not only did the four of us agree to get (78:06 - 78:10)
black and white together (78:08 - 78:13)
but we also agreed to rent a hotel (78:10 - 78:16)
outside of mall america drive six hours (78:13 - 78:18)
to there and attend (78:16 - 78:20)
this the mall the black and white tour (78:18 - 78:22)
um which i would have never done (78:20 - 78:25)
solo like there's no way i would have (78:22 - 78:26)
just gotten in the car and drove to mall (78:25 - 78:28)
of america by myself to like walk around (78:26 - 78:30)
the mall and be like i like pokemon (78:28 - 78:33)
i mean i think now i would but 10 years (78:30 - 78:34)
ago no (78:33 - 78:37)
so anyways we there's a there was a (78:34 - 78:38)
pop-up pokemon center (78:37 - 78:39)
at the mall of america was in the first (78:38 - 78:42)
floor and there was a huge line (78:39 - 78:44)
but it wasn't as long as the line to (78:42 - 78:46)
play the wii because they had the (78:44 - 78:48)
nintendo wii on display (78:46 - 78:50)
and that was insane like it was like a (78:48 - 78:52)
five hour wait to play like 10 minutes (78:50 - 78:55)
of nintendo wii um (78:52 - 78:56)
so we got a line for the pokemon center (78:55 - 78:58)
because we were there the day before (78:56 - 79:01)
the games launched so it was open (78:58 - 79:06)
and i can't remember um (79:01 - 79:07)
the line wasn't terribly long but (79:06 - 79:09)
somebody behind us i don't know where (79:07 - 79:10)
greg was but they were they were (79:09 - 79:12)
literally the couple behind us (79:10 - 79:16)
um they just like fainted and no one (79:12 - 79:17)
caught them (79:16 - 79:19)
so their head hit the ground and then (79:17 - 79:20)
they just started (79:19 - 79:23)
bleeding um and i believe they had a (79:20 - 79:25)
seizure i wasn't i'm not 100 sure but i (79:23 - 79:26)
believe (79:25 - 79:28)
that's what it was uh and then (79:26 - 79:29)
paramedics and everything came and then (79:28 - 79:30)
there was this really (79:29 - 79:34)
awkward situation of like (79:30 - 79:37)
do we leave the line like what because (79:34 - 79:39)
we weren't like blocking them like they (79:37 - 79:39)
they (79:39 - 79:41)
because we were in the roped off part (79:39 - 79:42)
they were in like the open before the (79:41 - 79:43)
roped off part (79:42 - 79:46)
and then everyone at the pokemon center (79:43 - 79:48)
just kept working (79:46 - 79:50)
and so we yeah what else are you gonna (79:48 - 79:52)
do we bought our plushes and then we (79:50 - 79:53)
watched them get carried away and it was (79:52 - 79:54)
like a really sad (79:53 - 79:57)
moment this one also for the record it (79:54 - 79:58)
says what is your favorite experience (79:57 - 79:59)
like that's not (79:58 - 80:00)
my why because it was favorite it's just (79:59 - 80:02)
i remember it but now i'm (80:00 - 80:04)
i didn't know that greg also saw that (80:02 - 80:05)
same thing because like (80:04 - 80:07)
what is the likelihood of that that you (80:05 - 80:08)
had to be there on that day (80:07 - 80:11)
and it's not like it's one person (80:08 - 80:13)
fainting in a in a huge time (80:11 - 80:16)
i was there with my friend uh nursey (80:13 - 80:18)
who's a doctor (80:16 - 80:20)
and when the p we we were aware that the (80:18 - 80:21)
paramedics arrived (80:20 - 80:24)
and i remember saying shouldn't you go (80:21 - 80:25)
over there and (80:24 - 80:27)
help and he's like no that's why the (80:25 - 80:29)
paramedics are here (80:27 - 80:32)
uh so we weren't waiting in line we were (80:29 - 80:34)
just in the area we i just remember the (80:32 - 80:35)
paramedics arriving (80:34 - 80:37)
[Music] (80:35 - 80:40)
what was going on yeah but it was what (80:37 - 80:42)
2000 and (80:40 - 80:44)
it was whatever was that it was (80:42 - 80:45)
literally the year that black and white (80:44 - 80:46)
came out (80:45 - 80:49)
yeah but it had been 2010 (80:46 - 80:52)
uh wait no black and white came out in (80:49 - 80:53)
2011 because i (80:52 - 80:57)
recently had a social media memory of (80:53 - 80:59)
i'm going to start i'm going to gamestop (80:57 - 81:00)
to get pokemon white when did you get (80:59 - 81:02)
married greg 2012 (81:00 - 81:05)
2014 oh okay so yeah you were you (81:02 - 81:06)
probably weren't even listening to the (81:05 - 81:07)
podcast then (81:06 - 81:11)
no i wasn't um (81:07 - 81:12)
uh because i don't think i started i (81:11 - 81:15)
started listening to the podcast at (81:12 - 81:19)
i want to say it was episode (81:15 - 81:19)
and the line was probably for the (81:20 - 81:27)
eu which came out in 2012 not (81:23 - 81:29)
oh yeah you're right 2006. yeah you're (81:27 - 81:30)
right it was for the wii u (81:29 - 81:32)
yes because because i cuz you could at (81:30 - 81:33)
the mall of america (81:32 - 81:35)
you could go up to like the second or (81:33 - 81:37)
third floor and you could look down (81:35 - 81:40)
because they they built like um they (81:37 - 81:42)
built like a castle or whatever (81:40 - 81:43)
and you could look down and people were (81:42 - 81:45)
doing the golf game where (81:43 - 81:48)
um like you put the wii on the ground (81:45 - 81:50)
and then you like tee it off with the (81:48 - 81:52)
wemo oh yeah yeah yeah so you could like (81:50 - 81:53)
see people playing the wii from the (81:52 - 81:54)
inside but if you were on the ground (81:53 - 81:56)
floor you couldn't see because they (81:54 - 81:58)
built walls up like a castle (81:56 - 82:00)
uh but that's why mall america is kind (81:58 - 82:01)
of cool because (82:00 - 82:03)
you go up floors and then you look down (82:01 - 82:04)
you can but that whole tour (82:03 - 82:07)
they're doing that whole tour gosh i (82:04 - 82:08)
remember like going in getting the games (82:07 - 82:10)
and then like walking over to like a (82:08 - 82:11)
restaurant in the restaurant hallway and (82:10 - 82:12)
then like sitting down and like (82:11 - 82:14)
redeeming the victini code (82:12 - 82:15)
i remember like yesterday they had like (82:14 - 82:18)
blown-up restaurants and (82:15 - 82:20)
they did and then you got pictures and (82:18 - 82:22)
then they had an area where (82:20 - 82:24)
you could um just literally sit down and (82:22 - 82:25)
they had movies going (82:24 - 82:28)
they had like a projector yep i remember (82:25 - 82:28)
um (82:28 - 82:30)
and then they had multiple stamp (82:28 - 82:32)
stations this was the like (82:30 - 82:36)
yeah this is like the this i i do always (82:32 - 82:37)
hate when people say like oh pokemon is (82:36 - 82:39)
for kids (82:37 - 82:41)
uh but like this thing was specifically (82:39 - 82:43)
for kids it was (82:41 - 82:46)
like it was like eight stamps (82:43 - 82:48)
it was like a little book and then um (82:46 - 82:49)
you would have to go (82:48 - 82:51)
to different places in the mall and then (82:49 - 82:53)
like you had to go to the restaurants (82:51 - 82:54)
that graham and get (82:53 - 82:55)
your stamp and then you had to go damn (82:54 - 82:57)
rambling yeah you had to go to the movie (82:55 - 82:57)
get your stamp (82:57 - 82:59)
well i don't know stamp rallies are like (82:57 - 83:00)
really big in japan but i would assume (82:59 - 83:02)
that was like all ages for japan (83:00 - 83:04)
but then they i don't know maybe they (83:02 - 83:05)
negotiated but one of them (83:04 - 83:07)
you had to go into like macy's and (83:05 - 83:08)
another one you had to actually like go (83:07 - 83:10)
in in nordstrom to get the stamps (83:08 - 83:12)
yeah you did uh you had to go to a bunch (83:10 - 83:14)
of places in the mall which is why i (83:12 - 83:16)
just wasn't doing it i remember we went (83:14 - 83:18)
i was there for (83:16 - 83:21)
a couple of hours i we we're gonna wait (83:18 - 83:23)
for the wii u and decided no we'll just (83:21 - 83:25)
get we'll just get it i don't wanna it's (83:23 - 83:26)
fine (83:25 - 83:30)
uh i bought a sniper plush (83:26 - 83:33)
uh what did i get i think i got a (83:30 - 83:35)
jirachi and a ted pig (83:33 - 83:36)
i don't know where that ted pig is (83:35 - 83:39)
anymore oh (83:36 - 83:43)
the love uh and then (83:39 - 83:46)
the thing happened and then (83:43 - 83:48)
we were just like uh do we want to do (83:46 - 83:49)
the stamp thing (83:48 - 83:52)
and then like no i didn't stamp thing uh (83:49 - 83:53)
we looked at the movie for a bit then we (83:52 - 83:55)
just went shopping and had food and then (83:53 - 83:55)
we left (83:55 - 83:58)
i don't think i think it was there for a (83:55 - 83:59)
chunk of time but not uh (83:58 - 84:02)
not the entire day but yeah we were (83:59 - 84:04)
because we talked later and when you (84:02 - 84:05)
said you're there i'm like oh yeah (84:04 - 84:09)
we probably saw each other because i was (84:05 - 84:11)
generally i'm always generally aware of (84:09 - 84:13)
the age demographic (84:11 - 84:17)
like like are there people around my age (84:13 - 84:19)
and just i generally look i just i (84:17 - 84:20)
generally watch people because i'm a (84:19 - 84:22)
people watcher (84:20 - 84:25)
uh just out of habit as i like for (84:22 - 84:26)
acting reasons picking up what other (84:25 - 84:28)
people do and how they hold themselves (84:26 - 84:30)
so i probably saw you and had no clue (84:28 - 84:32)
who you were i don't think (84:30 - 84:34)
i might have still no i was i was out of (84:32 - 84:38)

well i still have to figure out what was (84:59 - 85:01)
ten years i think okay i'm gonna go with (85:00 - 85:03)
10 years i will say the go fest that we (85:01 - 85:05)
all went to in chicago that was pretty (85:03 - 85:07)
had a lot of fun at that one (85:05 - 85:10)
that's not a great musical i saw a bunch (85:07 - 85:10)
of (85:10 - 85:14)
people i liked uh the day was nice (85:10 - 85:17)
uh i would say in the last 10 years (85:14 - 85:18)
that's the most (85:17 - 85:21)
memorable uh (85:18 - 85:23)
well i don't have it 20 years because i (85:21 - 85:25)
didn't go to any (85:23 - 85:29)
pokemon events at all until (85:25 - 85:32)
2012. uh (85:29 - 85:36)
my favorite pokemon event (85:32 - 85:36)
boy (85:39 - 85:42)
i mean i've done a bunch of stuff with (85:40 - 85:44)
you guys yeah (85:42 - 85:46)
it's like what does that count yeah that (85:44 - 85:48)

11 o'clock at night (85:50 - 85:52)
no no no no we need to we didn't leave (85:51 - 85:55)
until 1am what are you talking about (85:52 - 85:59)
the second one with me was great (85:55 - 85:59)
no we you went to the third one because (86:00 - 86:03)
this is the second (86:02 - 86:05)
second one was the one where you had to (86:03 - 86:08)
walk up and down uh was it lincoln park (86:05 - 86:11)
and it was it was raining in the morning (86:08 - 86:12)
when it was the third one (86:11 - 86:13)
it was raining in the morning and then (86:12 - 86:16)
it was just like this brutal heat wave (86:13 - 86:16)
at like (86:16 - 86:20)
3 p.m it was awful uh but i think we got (86:16 - 86:22)
raisin canes after that (86:20 - 86:24)
but yeah that did become our tradition (86:22 - 86:26)
to get keynes after (86:24 - 86:29)
pokemon go event which i love me some (86:26 - 86:29)
canes (86:29 - 86:33)
um so i guess out of other things that (86:29 - 86:35)
i've done with you guys (86:33 - 86:38)
uh i did go to a (86:35 - 86:41)
pokemon regional like a vgc competition (86:38 - 86:44)
in dumfries virginia (86:41 - 86:48)
with like dumbfruit dumfries dumfries (86:44 - 86:50)
d-u-m-f-r-i-e-s (86:48 - 86:52)
right uh (86:50 - 86:52)
is it wasn't something skepticism about (86:53 - 86:56)
a place that exists yeah yeah for (86:55 - 86:59)
somebody who lives next to like waukesha (86:56 - 87:02)
oh yes i can tell you the worst pokemon (86:59 - 87:03)
event i've been to (87:02 - 87:06)
was in [ __ ] rapids minnesota oh boy that (87:03 - 87:07)
was awesome (87:06 - 87:08)
nothing good happens including why were (87:07 - 87:11)
you in [ __ ] rapids minnesota okay (87:08 - 87:14)
oh boy either way i went with my buddy (87:11 - 87:14)
john (87:14 - 87:17)
we had a nice day i have a picture of me (87:14 - 87:18)
with a blow up (87:17 - 87:21)
zekrom and resharam and that was like my (87:18 - 87:21)
first (87:21 - 87:25)
time ever going to like a pokemon event (87:21 - 87:27)
so that was a lot of fun for me uh that (87:25 - 87:30)
was that was when irene and i were very (87:27 - 87:32)
into competitive pokemon (87:30 - 87:35)
and we were visiting uh (87:32 - 87:38)
i believe we were doing a christmas and (87:35 - 87:39)
it was like (87:38 - 87:41)
june it was january like 12th or (87:39 - 87:42)
something right (87:41 - 87:44)
you're doing christmas no no we went to (87:42 - 87:45)
irene's parents (87:44 - 87:47)
they couldn't like christmas was always (87:45 - 87:49)
like the weekend of (87:47 - 87:51)
new year's but somebody was out of town (87:49 - 87:52)
so we pushed it one week so it was like (87:51 - 87:54)
january 12th (87:52 - 87:56)
and so we did christmas friday night and (87:54 - 87:57)
then saturday we hung out with her (87:56 - 87:59)
family and then sundays normally when we (87:57 - 88:00)
come back to milwaukee (87:59 - 88:03)
and then we just checked the like oh (88:00 - 88:05)
sundays we normally play pokemon (88:03 - 88:07)
at some tournament we saw that there was (88:05 - 88:09)
like a tournament in [ __ ] rapids that (88:07 - 88:09)
weekend (88:09 - 88:11)
and we're like oh cool [ __ ] rapids is (88:09 - 88:13)
literally on the way back from st (88:11 - 88:16)
cloud minnesota i mean not exactly in (88:13 - 88:18)
the way but it's it's not out of the way (88:16 - 88:20)
so we're like we should stop the (88:18 - 88:22)
tournament starts at noon (88:20 - 88:23)
i mean we could leave your parents house (88:22 - 88:25)
at like 10 it takes 90 minutes to get (88:23 - 88:26)
there (88:25 - 88:27)
um and of course they'd like did the (88:26 - 88:29)
minnesota goodbye (88:27 - 88:31)
so that took like an hour so we're like (88:29 - 88:34)
okay so we got there at like (88:31 - 88:36)
11 59 or whatever and the tournament (88:34 - 88:37)
started at 12. (88:36 - 88:39)
we're like hey we're all the way from (88:37 - 88:42)
milwaukee can we register (88:39 - 88:43)
and they were they like kind of threw (88:42 - 88:45)
like a hissy fit they were like oh well (88:43 - 88:46)
you know it starts in a minute and i was (88:45 - 88:47)
like yeah that's (88:46 - 88:48)
if you want to give us a round one loss (88:47 - 88:50)
that's fine like (88:48 - 88:53)
no big deal and they're like no no no (88:50 - 88:55)
you were technically here on time (88:53 - 88:57)
and they like redid the player matching (88:55 - 88:58)
sheets which i don't think they really (88:57 - 88:59)
did (88:58 - 89:02)
so round one uh they paired (88:59 - 89:06)
me against irene so it's like cool (89:02 - 89:09)
glad we drove all this way so we can (89:06 - 89:10)
verse each other (89:09 - 89:14)
in this tournament um so we played our (89:10 - 89:15)
match and then i think we played one or (89:14 - 89:17)
two other matches (89:15 - 89:20)
uh that day and then just the people (89:17 - 89:23)
there were like really rude (89:20 - 89:26)
um (89:23 - 89:26)
and irene was like i'm the only black (89:26 - 89:31)
person here and i was like yeah let's go (89:28 - 89:33)
that sucks (89:31 - 89:33)
yeah um yeah they're just like really (89:34 - 89:39)
like i that was my only time in [ __ ] (89:37 - 89:41)
rapids but i don't think i'd ever go (89:39 - 89:41)
back (89:41 - 89:46)
what a weird city i mean (89:41 - 89:47)
there's nothing there so you don't (89:46 - 89:49)
really need to go back yeah (89:47 - 89:52)
that's probably the worst uh favorite (89:49 - 89:54)
pokemon event i've been to in the last (89:52 - 89:55)
10 years (89:54 - 89:57)
i don't know i like to go fast a lot no (89:55 - 89:58)
one brought up the pokemon symphonic (89:57 - 89:59)
evolution stuff (89:58 - 90:03)
that was pretty sweet the concerts (89:59 - 90:06)
oh yeah i went with joe that was really (90:03 - 90:08)
good well actually i saw it like (90:06 - 90:11)
twice because i saw it at (90:08 - 90:13)
the the world championships the first (90:11 - 90:15)
time they were in dc (90:13 - 90:17)
because that's where they debuted it and (90:15 - 90:18)
then i saw it (90:17 - 90:22)
at the um wolf trap with joe (90:18 - 90:24)
i think i went to one i think it went to (90:22 - 90:25)
the one that was that was here (90:24 - 90:28)
but i saw it in dc it was really bad (90:25 - 90:30)
that was such a bad experience (90:28 - 90:33)
the dc one i wonder oh the (90:30 - 90:36)
because the person who i was sitting (90:33 - 90:37)
next to (90:36 - 90:41)
that was just the most obnoxious person (90:37 - 90:45)
there i i think her friends i think her (90:41 - 90:46)
friends escorted her (90:45 - 90:50)
out halfway through but (90:46 - 90:52)
she insisted on talking to me even (90:50 - 90:54)
though it's never met her before in my (90:52 - 90:54)
life (90:54 - 90:56)
throughout the concert while the music (90:54 - 90:59)
was going on she insisted on talking to (90:56 - 91:01)
me (90:59 - 91:02)
were they playing like trainers eyes (91:01 - 91:04)
meet (91:02 - 91:08)
no but it was like they played music (91:04 - 91:10)
from pokemon crystal and she was like oh (91:08 - 91:12)
this was the first game where you could (91:10 - 91:13)
play as a girl and (91:12 - 91:15)
i just remember when i was you know (91:13 - 91:16)
whatever years old and i was (91:15 - 91:18)
so excited that i could finally play i'm (91:16 - 91:22)
like i don't know you and i don't care (91:18 - 91:24)
i'm trying to enjoy the performance (91:22 - 91:25)
ahead of me i (91:24 - 91:28)
went to the one in milwaukee and (91:25 - 91:31)
uh that team the sephonic evolution team (91:28 - 91:34)
actually reached out to me before they (91:31 - 91:36)
came to milwaukee and they offered me (91:34 - 91:38)
free tickets (91:36 - 91:40)
and i think mr fans they offered i think (91:38 - 91:42)
on the show we played a couple samples (91:40 - 91:43)
because they were like hey can you (91:42 - 91:45)
advertise it for us (91:43 - 91:48)
this was before like the fdc got real (91:45 - 91:49)
strict about (91:48 - 91:52)
ads and stuff um so i think we played a (91:49 - 91:53)
few samples and then (91:52 - 91:57)
i like i met up with them (91:53 - 91:59)
because they like the the guy who ran it (91:57 - 92:00)
was like hey just you know (91:59 - 92:03)
shoot me a text when you're here uh and (92:00 - 92:04)
then they (92:03 - 92:05)
asked if i wanted to get dinner with the (92:04 - 92:08)
staff afterwards so like irene and i (92:05 - 92:10)

musicians and like the staff (92:12 - 92:16)
and the programmer and the director and (92:14 - 92:18)

so we like the next day we drove down to (92:22 - 92:26)
chicago we saw the same exact show (92:24 - 92:28)
although it was better in chicago i mean (92:26 - 92:30)
like when you're comparing milwaukee (92:28 - 92:32)
musicals to chicago's musical chicago (92:30 - 92:35)
way way better it was exactly the same (92:32 - 92:36)

minneapolis to go to orchestra hall (92:54 - 92:59)
where you can crumple a dollar bill on (92:56 - 93:02)
stage without a microphone and hear it (92:59 - 93:04)
all the way at the top in the third (93:02 - 93:06)
balcony they showed us this (93:04 - 93:09)

years ago exactly ten years ago you know (93:50 - 93:53)
what they say (93:53 - 93:55)
for you that was the greatest day in (93:53 - 93:56)
your life (93:55 - 94:00)
like it was a tuesday ah i i'm sure i (93:56 - 94:02)
have the match of me against wolf glick (94:00 - 94:03)
somewhere (94:02 - 94:05)
that'd make good youtube comment content (94:03 - 94:08)
i'll give my commentary of a 12 year old (94:05 - 94:10)
match against wolf click (94:08 - 94:12)
uh where i beat him with a basketland (94:10 - 94:14)
and maractus (94:12 - 94:16)
because it was a gimmick it was it was (94:14 - 94:17)
the two out of three you would have (94:16 - 94:18)
gotten stumped (94:17 - 94:20)
it was two i think we did do two out of (94:18 - 94:22)
three oh now the (94:20 - 94:23)
now the whole everything you just keep (94:22 - 94:25)
changing everything yeah well (94:23 - 94:26)
yeah i think it was i think it was best (94:25 - 94:28)
i think it was best seven out of ten (94:26 - 94:33)
i think so you know (94:28 - 94:38)
uh pokemon of the week all right (94:33 - 94:41)
all right last week's pokemon of the (94:38 - 94:43)
week (94:41 - 94:43)
a sea creature that you have to take up (94:44 - 94:49)
on a mountain to evolve what is it (94:46 - 94:49)
it's (94:50 - 94:52)
krabby you almost said the right thing (94:53 - 95:02)
the most forgettable pokemon out there (95:04 - 95:08)
you know (95:07 - 95:12)
you're not wrong but but the (95:08 - 95:14)
thing is too like what really struck me (95:12 - 95:15)
about cremitable (95:14 - 95:20)
is it was in alola (95:15 - 95:24)
end of sentence yeah (95:20 - 95:27)
it has never never existed before has (95:24 - 95:30)
not existed was not brought into galler (95:27 - 95:33)
yes for you know fighting ice (95:30 - 95:36)
no shell like that don't even come don't (95:33 - 95:37)
even come at me (95:36 - 95:38)
it's or does it have a shovel like him (95:37 - 95:40)
it should it's a it's a cool book (95:38 - 95:43)
it does oh it's bad that's okay (95:40 - 95:45)
weird like who who would have thought (95:43 - 95:47)
hey let me take this (95:45 - 95:50)
little crab thing up on a mountain and (95:47 - 95:52)
use it to battle oh wait now it's (95:50 - 95:54)
evolved yeah (95:52 - 95:55)
i feel like it's one of those pokemon (95:54 - 95:56)
where they're just like giving a nice (95:55 - 95:59)
stone in the future and call it a day (95:56 - 96:02)
yeah no they will never it will never (95:59 - 96:02)
it'll (96:02 - 96:05)
never be moving abominable trivia will (96:02 - 96:06)
be (96:05 - 96:09)
this was in one game two games (96:06 - 96:10)
technically (96:09 - 96:12)
and never again never heard it was one (96:10 - 96:14)
of the first fighting types you got (96:12 - 96:15)
though right (96:14 - 96:17)
brawler was so there was like cor (96:15 - 96:19)
brawler is fighting (96:17 - 96:21)
only and then credominable is ice (96:19 - 96:22)
fighting right (96:21 - 96:24)
rommel is the only ice type pokemon (96:22 - 96:26)
introduced in gen 7. (96:24 - 96:27)
no other pokemon has the same type (96:26 - 96:29)
combination uh (96:27 - 96:33)
cr crab ah ah bull i can't ever say it (96:29 - 96:35)
crab ominable (96:33 - 96:37)
has the longest english name of any (96:35 - 96:39)
pokemon with 12 letters (96:37 - 96:43)
because they dropped the e for alligator (96:39 - 96:48)
still mad about that i talk about (96:43 - 96:49)
lazy you want to talk about game freak (96:48 - 96:50)
being lazy couldn't even figure out how (96:49 - 96:51)
to fit an e (96:50 - 96:54)
for alligator's name look there were (96:51 - 96:55)
data limits (96:54 - 96:59)
that had to be respected they had in (96:55 - 97:01)
okay this is the truth they when they (96:59 - 97:03)
dropped the e they found room to put all (97:01 - 97:08)
of kanto (97:03 - 97:08)
copy and paste the charizard (97:15 - 97:25)
carbohy and its pre-evolved (97:21 - 97:27)
form are the only fighting type pokemon (97:25 - 97:30)
to have an insectoid body is that (97:27 - 97:34)
is does buzzwell not count (97:30 - 97:36)
[Music] (97:34 - 97:39)
hmm because i don't think that (97:36 - 97:42)
i don't think brawler is an insect i i (97:39 - 97:43)
think it's more of a (97:42 - 97:46)
um crustacean or a (97:43 - 97:49)
what is a spider (97:46 - 97:53)
what what is that a (97:49 - 97:56)
arachnid (97:53 - 97:56)
the only ice type pokemon to have an (97:56 - 97:59)
inside body (97:57 - 98:01)
i think they're talking about how like (97:59 - 98:03)
the pokemon games have like (98:01 - 98:06)
the little uh icons (98:03 - 98:07)
and you know how like tyranitar looks (98:06 - 98:11)
like a little like dragon and (98:07 - 98:13)
like the snake icon and the head icon i (98:11 - 98:16)
think that's what they're talking about (98:13 - 98:19)
i don't remember how the game uses those (98:16 - 98:21)
icons though (98:19 - 98:23)
oh yeah it's the shape it's the shape (98:21 - 98:24)
the shape (98:23 - 98:27)
and buzzwole has like an octopus looking (98:24 - 98:28)
shape (98:27 - 98:31)
where chrominable has like a little (98:28 - 98:34)
caterpillar-looking shape got it (98:31 - 98:36)
yeah don't i can't say where in the (98:34 - 98:38)
games you actually ever see them (98:36 - 98:41)
there was one okay kerbominable card (98:38 - 98:44)
that was introduced in the tcg i think (98:41 - 98:44)
it was (98:44 - 98:46)
maybe around the time of crimson (98:44 - 98:49)
invasion and it was like a very cheap (98:46 - 98:52)
budget deck that people ran um (98:49 - 98:56)
and that's the gist of it (98:52 - 98:56)
it was like it was like an okay cheap (98:56 - 99:00)
budget deck that (98:58 - 99:02)
worked pretty consistently um but it (99:00 - 99:03)
wasn't oh it was like a b (99:02 - 99:05)
maybe like a b or c tier deck it wasn't (99:03 - 99:08)
like an a that is like (99:05 - 99:12)
75 of pokemon tcg decks that exist (99:08 - 99:15)
that they're just like for okay and then (99:12 - 99:16)
25 (99:15 - 99:20)
are meta yeah or like uh 99 (99:16 - 99:23)
or adp it came full circle the whole (99:20 - 99:24)
podcast was full circle (99:23 - 99:26)

family that includes members that are (99:30 - 99:33)
every type other than fighting flying (99:32 - 99:35)
poison ground rock bug go steel and (99:33 - 99:38)
dragon in most games it required access (99:35 - 99:40)
to a specific location to evolve (99:38 - 99:42)
i guess they didn't originally have (99:40 - 99:45)
these in kanto johto or hoen (99:42 - 99:47)
in one episode of the pokemon cartoon it (99:45 - 99:48)
is revealed that (99:47 - 99:51)
cynthia has this pokemon as she has it (99:48 - 99:54)
used the ice beam attack to freeze some (99:51 - 99:55)
river water to aid in (99:54 - 99:58)
ailing mellowetta this pokemon has only (99:55 - 100:00)
ever been catchable in the wild in (99:58 - 100:03)
galler which is also the first place (100:00 - 100:05)
where evolving into this pokemon (100:03 - 100:08)
relied on a held item rather than a (100:05 - 100:11)
specific location (100:08 - 100:14)

confuse the heck out of me so if they (100:46 - 100:49)
