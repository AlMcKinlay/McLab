[Music] (0:02 - 0:26)
what's up everyone welcome to the 450 (0:27 - 0:33)
episode of the pokemon podcast it's (0:30 - 0:35)
super effective i'm your host (0:33 - 0:38)
spj with me is greg hello (0:35 - 0:42)
happy discounted chocolate day it's the (0:38 - 0:43)
best day (0:42 - 0:46)
it's monday all the chocolate goes on (0:43 - 0:48)
discount (0:46 - 0:50)
i need to make a trip to target to get (0:48 - 0:51)
my discounted chocolate (0:50 - 0:55)
yeah strawberry uh jellybean (0:51 - 0:58)
straw straw star bursts (0:55 - 1:02)
not strawberries well star burst jelly (0:58 - 1:04)
beans (1:02 - 1:04)
those are good they're good i think the (1:04 - 1:09)
jolly rancher jelly beans are better (1:06 - 1:12)
no people have had those jelly belly (1:09 - 1:12)
jelly beans (1:12 - 1:14)
oh we have well we have a whole bunch of (1:12 - 1:16)
jelly belly jelly beans because we had a (1:14 - 1:17)
giant container at (1:16 - 1:20)
the costco because they didn't have a (1:17 - 1:22)
giant container of twizzlers (1:20 - 1:26)
so instead we got a giant container of (1:22 - 1:28)
uh jelly bellies choices we have to make (1:26 - 1:29)
in life true (1:28 - 1:31)
but there are so many flavors of jelly (1:29 - 1:32)
belly that i (1:31 - 1:35)
don't like that i just like my husband (1:32 - 1:37)
just grabs a handful and just eats (1:35 - 1:39)
whatever and i think that's madness (1:37 - 1:42)
well i'm i'm more in your husband's (1:39 - 1:45)
line but you are aware that if you shop (1:42 - 1:47)
at places other than costco you can (1:45 - 1:48)
actually buy (1:47 - 1:51)
single flavor bags of jelly belly (1:48 - 1:54)
jelly beans and then mix and match for (1:51 - 1:55)
whatever taste sensation you would like (1:54 - 1:57)
to create for your handful of jelly (1:55 - 1:58)
beans (1:57 - 2:01)
nobody does that that's madness will is (1:58 - 2:02)
there (2:01 - 2:09)
yeah i still don't have a house (2:02 - 2:13)
it is so weird to me i am like literally (2:09 - 2:15)
like running around the streets of (2:13 - 2:16)
minneapolis with (2:15 - 2:18)
money in my hands like take my money (2:16 - 2:20)
take my money please let me have a house (2:18 - 2:21)
and (2:20 - 2:24)
i have seen places with you i know that (2:21 - 2:26)
looked at places that was not that place (2:24 - 2:27)
was not (2:26 - 2:29)
not cutting the not making the grade (2:27 - 2:31)
there no (2:29 - 2:35)
i mean price was right price right (2:31 - 2:37)
if i wanted to have my bedroom in the (2:35 - 2:39)
living room because i can't fit an (2:37 - 2:41)
actual bed in the bedroom (2:39 - 2:45)
yes the bedrooms are a little odd my (2:41 - 2:48)
super large size love sack would take up (2:45 - 2:50)
the entirety of one of those rooms (2:48 - 2:52)
you're gonna lived in the basement the (2:50 - 2:54)
basement was nice i feel like greg in (2:52 - 2:56)
another life is like a real estate agent (2:54 - 2:57)
and (2:56 - 2:59)
you know greg's mom is a real estate (2:57 - 3:00)
agent (2:59 - 3:04)
so every house we see greg is like sees (3:00 - 3:07)
the positive in it (3:04 - 3:07)
okay so i i have never rented a house (3:08 - 3:13)
before right and this is literally my (3:11 - 3:15)
first time renting this part well (3:13 - 3:18)
whatever that whole concept of (3:15 - 3:20)
the house doesn't come with a washer and (3:18 - 3:22)
dryer you can bring your own or (3:20 - 3:26)
grab one from us i'm like no no that was (3:22 - 3:26)
bad (3:26 - 3:29)
a little bit we walked in i had a lot of (3:26 - 3:31)
i had a lot of okay this could be nice (3:29 - 3:33)
until we walked into the bedrooms of (3:31 - 3:33)
that (3:33 - 3:37)
place and i was like oh no yes (3:33 - 3:41)
no this is not this is not an (3:37 - 3:43)
actual house these are after well it was (3:41 - 3:44)
a house (3:43 - 3:47)
in like the 1850s when people were about (3:44 - 3:48)
two feet (3:47 - 3:50)
shorter than they currently are and they (3:48 - 3:52)
lived in smaller (3:50 - 3:55)
homes correct and it had a nice sized (3:52 - 3:56)
bathroom (3:55 - 4:00)
at the sake of everything bedroom yes (3:56 - 4:04)
what are you doing well speaking of (4:00 - 4:04)
afterthoughts (4:04 - 4:07)
uh this is the 25th anniversary of (4:04 - 4:09)
pokemon yeah (4:07 - 4:09)
and there's not right now a lot of (4:10 - 4:14)
pokemon (4:13 - 4:15)
news but we do have some we always have (4:14 - 4:17)
some luck when i say (4:15 - 4:18)
there's not a lot of pokemon news i mean (4:17 - 4:20)
we got a two-hour show instead of a (4:18 - 4:21)
five-hour show (4:20 - 4:24)
yes i mean if there's (4:21 - 4:27)
even on the least pokemon news (4:24 - 4:29)
week of the year we can dig up something (4:27 - 4:31)
even if we have to go out and make it (4:29 - 4:32)
ourselves (4:31 - 4:35)
remember uh sbj has gone (4:32 - 4:38)
to articles from the past i haven't (4:35 - 4:41)
brought them back forward so there is (4:38 - 4:41)
nothing (4:41 - 4:44)
there is nothing off the table i'm half (4:41 - 4:46)
expecting him to say well i expect this (4:44 - 4:47)
article (4:46 - 4:49)
to be written at some point so let's (4:47 - 4:50)
spend an hour talking about (4:49 - 4:53)
hypothetical future news i have an xy (4:50 - 4:56)
interview that i dug up that is very (4:53 - 4:57)
good (4:56 - 4:59)
but we have even though it's a slow new (4:57 - 5:01)
news week we have enough news where we (4:59 - 5:02)
don't have to (5:01 - 5:04)
dig up that x wire it's it's there it's (5:02 - 5:05)
we're saving it (5:04 - 5:08)
why are we saving it i play the long con (5:05 - 5:10)
it's like when travis was on the show (5:08 - 5:11)
and (5:10 - 5:13)
they gave me permission to read the (5:11 - 5:15)
email they wrote in (5:13 - 5:19)
and i saved it for like 17 weeks before (5:15 - 5:23)
we're saving the xy news article for (5:19 - 5:26)
the remakes yeah yeah yeah yeah (5:23 - 5:29)
um we do have some pokemon news uh not a (5:26 - 5:30)
lot but we do have some (5:29 - 5:32)
ranging from a variety of topics here we (5:30 - 5:35)
got some tcg we got some masters we got (5:32 - 5:37)
some go we got somebody breaking in and (5:35 - 5:38)
stealing pokemon cards you know the (5:37 - 5:42)
the plethora of things to to cover this (5:38 - 5:45)
this show but let's (5:42 - 5:49)
start off with um some tcg news (5:45 - 5:53)
which is uh from psa psa (5:49 - 5:56)
is a grading service (5:53 - 5:56)
psa i would say at this point psa is (5:57 - 6:01)
like the kleenex (5:59 - 6:04)
of grading services there are multiple (6:01 - 6:05)
grading services (6:04 - 6:09)
there's psa there's beckett there's like (6:05 - 6:10)
the other one i can't remember that no (6:09 - 6:11)
one uses and then there's another one (6:10 - 6:13)
that no one really uses but there's a (6:11 - 6:14)
bunch of them (6:13 - 6:16)
uh but everyone just defaults and says (6:14 - 6:17)
psa (6:16 - 6:21)
even though i feel like this is rep (6:17 - 6:23)
like good i think becca is fancier yeah (6:21 - 6:24)
when i was (6:23 - 6:29)
working in a card shop in my youth (6:24 - 6:31)
it was always about becca everyone's (6:29 - 6:32)
coming in to get the beckett book (6:31 - 6:34)
and everybody always talked about (6:32 - 6:35)
beckett and they would ask me questions (6:34 - 6:37)
about baseball cards and i'd looked at (6:35 - 6:37)
them (6:37 - 6:39)
like they had they were insane and then (6:37 - 6:41)
i would call over the sports card (6:39 - 6:43)
person and then he would talk to them (6:41 - 6:46)
about beckett this psa thing (6:43 - 6:48)
it's like a public service announcement (6:46 - 6:49)
yeah exactly (6:48 - 6:51)
i don't know i don't why is public (6:49 - 6:53)
service announcements raiding cards (6:51 - 6:55)
i mean it does not benefit the public to (6:53 - 6:57)
say that this charizard has bad (6:55 - 7:01)
edges whatever that means i think (6:57 - 7:02)
i think there's like two things here (7:01 - 7:04)
number one is psa is like easier to say (7:02 - 7:05)
than beckett (7:04 - 7:07)
kind of rolls off the tongue is it (7:05 - 7:09)
because it has more syllables (7:07 - 7:12)
yeah and psa is a bunch of letters well (7:09 - 7:13)
that's why i say it's like the kleenex (7:12 - 7:14)
because (7:13 - 7:15)
you could just call everything tissue (7:14 - 7:17)
but people just call everything kleenex (7:15 - 7:17)
at this point (7:17 - 7:21)
ah i see what you're saying (7:17 - 7:23)
and then the second thing is psa (7:21 - 7:25)
partnered with logan paul (7:23 - 7:28)
and so uh no i know i'm so (7:25 - 7:30)
caught by we talked about this before (7:28 - 7:33)
how logan paul bought like all these (7:30 - 7:37)
first edition original booster boxes (7:33 - 7:40)
and he then sent them in to psa (7:37 - 7:42)
and psa does their grading and they (7:40 - 7:44)
graded them but they also put logan paul (7:42 - 7:47)
on the grading so when when he (7:44 - 7:50)
resells them whether that's for personal (7:47 - 7:52)
gain or charity i think he's done some (7:50 - 7:53)
for charity look i'm trying to see the (7:52 - 7:54)
positive of (7:53 - 7:57)
some sort of light here um you could be (7:54 - 7:58)
like well this is a psa charizard this (7:57 - 8:00)
is a psa charizard but this is a psa (7:58 - 8:02)
charizard that was open from logan paul (8:00 - 8:05)
it's a logan paul psa charisma so it's (8:02 - 8:07)
tainted with racism (8:05 - 8:10)
all kinds of issues a lot of issues (8:07 - 8:10)
there (8:10 - 8:12)
i'm just saying i'm just giving you the (8:10 - 8:15)
reason why psa might be popular and (8:12 - 8:17)
which comes to the article (8:15 - 8:21)
psa customer update april 2021 which was (8:17 - 8:24)
published on march 30th (8:21 - 8:27)
hello psa customers since my wait wait (8:24 - 8:28)
wait can i just say (8:27 - 8:32)
it's a psa psa yep okay thank you (8:28 - 8:34)
go ahead (8:32 - 8:34)
let's skip skip something this uh i'll (8:35 - 8:40)
try to illustrate what has happened with (8:38 - 8:41)
the sheer (8:40 - 8:43)
volume of orders that psa received in (8:41 - 8:44)
early march (8:43 - 8:46)
has fundamentally changed our ability to (8:44 - 8:47)
service the hobby (8:46 - 8:49)
in reality is that we've recently (8:47 - 8:51)
received more cards in the last three (8:49 - 8:52)
days than we have in the last three (8:51 - 8:53)
months (8:52 - 8:55)
even after the surge submissions (8:53 - 8:57)
continue at a never before seen level (8:55 - 8:59)
given our growth i'm not a hundred (8:57 - 9:01)
percent what caused (8:59 - 9:03)
that specifically the three more cards (9:01 - 9:05)
in three days in the last three months (9:03 - 9:09)
um given our growing backlog it would be (9:05 - 9:09)
dangerous for (9:09 - 9:11)
disingenuous i think it's dangerous (9:09 - 9:14)
works disingenuous for us to continue (9:11 - 9:14)
and accept (9:14 - 9:16)
submissions for cards that we are unable (9:14 - 9:19)
to process for the foreseeable future (9:16 - 9:20)
it is an unpleasant conclusion (9:19 - 9:22)
especially after march 1st is (9:20 - 9:24)
price increase they increased how much (9:22 - 9:26)
they cost to grade (9:24 - 9:27)
i think it was like eight dollars before (9:26 - 9:29)
it might be like 14 or something (9:27 - 9:32)
um but it is necessarily to properly (9:29 - 9:34)
serve the customers who have already (9:32 - 9:35)
submitted to psa (9:34 - 9:37)
effective immediately psa is temporarily (9:35 - 9:39)
suspending our value (9:37 - 9:41)
regular and expressed service levels (9:39 - 9:43)
which will allow us to fully unbox and (9:41 - 9:45)
receive recent surge of orders to focus (9:43 - 9:46)
on (9:45 - 9:48)
our most impactive service lines we are (9:46 - 9:49)
taking a tiered approach to (9:48 - 9:51)
reintroducing these service levels back (9:49 - 9:52)
on july (9:51 - 9:55)
1st um and then they are talking about (9:52 - 9:57)
how they have bought a (9:55 - 10:00)
60 000 square foot california operation (9:57 - 10:03)
on top of adding another 62 000 square (10:00 - 10:03)
foot (10:03 - 10:07)
warehouse a couple months ago (10:03 - 10:07)
and that they have uh as of right now (10:07 - 10:13)
783 people working for them (10:09 - 10:16)
and back in january of 2020 they only (10:13 - 10:20)
had 420 employees working for them (10:16 - 10:20)
and so yeah you can't uh i actually did (10:21 - 10:25)
a youtube video about this (10:23 - 10:28)
in february and in that youtube video (10:25 - 10:30)
i talked about how psa put out an (10:28 - 10:31)
article in december (10:30 - 10:32)
saying that they were falling (10:31 - 10:34)
dramatically behind and if you sent in (10:32 - 10:35)
cards (10:34 - 10:37)
in december or january you probably (10:35 - 10:38)
wouldn't get them back until (10:37 - 10:42)
june or july unless you paid for express (10:38 - 10:43)
and express you weren't even getting (10:42 - 10:46)
back quickly uh (10:43 - 10:47)
and now you can't send anything to psa (10:46 - 10:49)
so uh (10:47 - 10:52)
this is not even regular no everything (10:49 - 10:53)
is closed for people so hard is it to (10:52 - 10:55)
look at a card (10:53 - 10:57)
yeah oh yeah come on they're providing a (10:55 - 11:01)
quality service here they're not just (10:57 - 11:01)
[Music] (11:04 - 11:07)
it's just like how magnitude works in (11:08 - 11:12)
pokemon they just roll and i pick a (11:10 - 11:14)
number and send it back (11:12 - 11:16)
are you going to argue with them who's (11:14 - 11:17)
going to argue who are you going to go (11:16 - 11:18)
to you're going to go to beckett (11:17 - 11:20)
apparently not according to steve (11:18 - 11:22)
well you know well no i would go to (11:20 - 11:24)
becky i think it is (11:22 - 11:26)
because i'm pretty sure beckett has like (11:24 - 11:29)
beckett breaks down all four categories (11:26 - 11:32)
on the top part of it or psa doesn't psa (11:29 - 11:33)
just gives you a number beckett is like (11:32 - 11:35)
centering a 10. (11:33 - 11:40)
edge is a 9.5 hollow of 10. (11:35 - 11:44)
but also i've seen psa tens where the (11:40 - 11:45)
centering is way off and then (11:44 - 11:47)
somebody's always like ah well so-and-so (11:45 - 11:49)
is very generous on the centering and (11:47 - 11:51)
it's like (11:49 - 11:53)
what do you what do you mean isn't this (11:51 - 11:55)
supposed to be a standard (11:53 - 11:57)
no why would it be a standard it's (11:55 - 11:59)
literally people looking at it it's not (11:57 - 12:01)
like they have a computer program if (11:59 - 12:03)
they did this whole thing would be done (12:01 - 12:04)
that's what they need they need to put (12:03 - 12:07)
these 783 people (12:04 - 12:10)
on a computer program yes the artificial (12:07 - 12:11)
intelligences can (12:10 - 12:13)
be scanned you can rate these cards much (12:11 - 12:15)
faster than pitiful (12:13 - 12:18)
hitting cards is dumb it really is like (12:15 - 12:22)
yes but like because look i have i have (12:18 - 12:24)
where is it i have it buried on my desk (12:22 - 12:25)
i have (12:24 - 12:27)
this if you're if you're if you're (12:25 - 12:28)
losing the podcast i'm i'm (12:27 - 12:30)
showing your ego that's money right (12:28 - 12:32)
there shiny (12:30 - 12:34)
charizard yeah this whole article was an (12:32 - 12:40)
excuse for him to fight yeah (12:34 - 12:40)
what set is this from shining led (12:40 - 12:44)
shining face shining legendary fates (12:42 - 12:48)
shining legends leafy i pulled this (12:44 - 12:48)
look look look very very cool right (12:49 - 12:55)
and i can already tell you it's not a (12:54 - 12:57)
psa 10. why because i (12:55 - 12:59)
one i have eyes number two is there's (12:57 - 13:00)
like a small little white (12:59 - 13:02)
speckle here in the bottom corner you (13:00 - 13:03)
can barely see it you gotta bust out (13:02 - 13:04)
your detective pikachu (13:03 - 13:07)
magnifying glass to see it but i know if (13:04 - 13:08)
i send it to psa (13:07 - 13:10)
or beckett or whatever the other company (13:08 - 13:12)
are they're going to see that little dot (13:10 - 13:13)
that i see (13:12 - 13:15)
and they're going to be like it's a 9.5 (13:13 - 13:17)
it's a 9.2 it's a not (13:15 - 13:20)
like it's not a 10. so i even send it (13:17 - 13:22)
why would you send a card (13:20 - 13:24)
that you know is not going to be a 10. (13:22 - 13:27)
can you paint over that dot though (13:24 - 13:30)
nah and and look i i (13:27 - 13:33)
i open the pack very carefully like i do (13:30 - 13:35)
all my packs but (13:33 - 13:38)
buying pokemon cards is dumb (13:35 - 13:42)
yes because you can you can buy like (13:38 - 13:44)
a thousand packs of shining fates and (13:42 - 13:45)
they could all have bad edges (13:44 - 13:47)
there's nothing you can do to prevent it (13:45 - 13:49)
because no one knows until you open the (13:47 - 13:49)
pack (13:49 - 13:53)
and pokemon is has whatever quality (13:49 - 13:54)
control issues that they have (13:53 - 13:56)
and they're pumping them out the door as (13:54 - 13:58)
fast as possible so edges are always bad (13:56 - 14:01)
like centering is always mostly off (13:58 - 14:03)
sketch (14:01 - 14:06)
it's it's a dumb hobby so yes what are (14:03 - 14:07)
they going to do with all these people (14:06 - 14:10)
once the surge is over (14:07 - 14:13)
uh seasonal hiring yeah with a whole (14:10 - 14:14)
other factory (14:13 - 14:17)
target at christmas no you've you fire (14:14 - 14:18)
them (14:17 - 14:20)
and you say your time your usefulness (14:18 - 14:22)
has been yeah (14:20 - 14:24)
uh and then we're gonna close down this (14:22 - 14:26)
california operation because we aren't (14:24 - 14:27)
getting (14:26 - 14:29)
pokemon cards from logan paul anymore (14:27 - 14:31)
yeah but i mean the answer (14:29 - 14:33)
if you want an answer to your question (14:31 - 14:34)
it's once again (14:33 - 14:37)
not everybody is you and (14:34 - 14:41)
you you yes i don't send anything to psa (14:37 - 14:45)
exactly but but the thing is our (14:41 - 14:48)
average person who has just started (14:45 - 14:51)
buying up pokemon cards because they saw (14:48 - 14:53)
mr famous do it and they think it's a (14:51 - 14:55)
real thing (14:53 - 14:58)
is now also believes that for those (14:55 - 15:02)
pokemon cards to have any real value (14:58 - 15:05)
psa has to rate them yes (15:02 - 15:08)
so it's like they are literally going (15:05 - 15:10)
pack to hopefully top loader (15:08 - 15:13)
yeah without without even giving the (15:10 - 15:14)
card a (15:13 - 15:18)
a decent look just to get it graded (15:14 - 15:20)
yeah i i don't have anything i have one (15:18 - 15:22)
graded card and it was sent to me as a (15:20 - 15:23)
gift (15:22 - 15:26)
it's a first edition team rocket (15:23 - 15:27)
squirtle (15:26 - 15:29)
now the time it was sent to me as a gift (15:27 - 15:30)
because i was like (15:29 - 15:33)
i've never gotten a graded card before (15:30 - 15:34)
and the time it was sent for me as a (15:33 - 15:35)
gift (15:34 - 15:38)
i opened it on my twitch stream we they (15:35 - 15:38)
they (15:38 - 15:39)
said they like thank you for making (15:38 - 15:41)
content i really appreciate you here's a (15:39 - 15:42)
bunch of stuff (15:41 - 15:45)
and i was like wow like the first (15:42 - 15:46)
thought was like wow you sent me a psa (15:45 - 15:48)
card it must be worth something and i (15:46 - 15:49)
looked it up and it was like an eight (15:48 - 15:50)
dollar squirtle right (15:49 - 15:52)
but now that same squirtle card is worth (15:50 - 15:54)
five hundred dollars (15:52 - 15:56)
because prices have gone up so yeah i (15:54 - 15:58)
should sell it because no (15:56 - 16:00)
because when i got it was five dolla (15:58 - 16:01)
eight dollars but it was a gift and it (16:00 - 16:03)
feels very weird (16:01 - 16:06)
when you got it you got it for zero um (16:03 - 16:09)
and now you sell it like gamestop well (16:06 - 16:10)
my problem with psa (16:09 - 16:13)
cards is you can't put them in a binder (16:10 - 16:14)
there's like (16:13 - 16:17)
they just take up this extra space (16:14 - 16:18)
you've got to frame them (16:17 - 16:21)
yeah no they they are they're in the the (16:18 - 16:21)
no no (16:21 - 16:25)
you and then you buy a nice frame (16:21 - 16:28)
too so you can display it on your wall (16:25 - 16:32)
like the piece of art that it is (16:28 - 16:32)
yeah i guess i would only get something (16:33 - 16:37)
psa if i was to sell it because (16:35 - 16:39)
you're right it does increase like you (16:37 - 16:41)
can sell psa parts more for (16:39 - 16:42)
them yeah yes but i don't plan on (16:41 - 16:44)
selling my like i collect my carts to (16:42 - 16:45)
collect my carts like if i sold this (16:44 - 16:47)
charizard (16:45 - 16:50)
now i got a hole in my collection well (16:47 - 16:52)
but what's also even more bizarre to me (16:50 - 16:55)
is so you don't sell the extras well if (16:52 - 16:56)
i had two charizards yeah i would (16:55 - 16:58)
probably sell one of them but i only got (16:56 - 16:59)
one charizard (16:58 - 17:01)
it's a hard life only having one (16:59 - 17:02)
charizard oh (17:01 - 17:04)
here so here's the thing that's like (17:02 - 17:06)
even more bizarre to me is (17:04 - 17:09)
once you get a card psa rated you can't (17:06 - 17:13)
play with it anymore and i buy trading (17:09 - 17:14)
cards to play (17:13 - 17:18)
trading card games and it's like now it (17:14 - 17:20)
has zero value for me because i can't (17:18 - 17:23)
put it in a deck (17:20 - 17:23)
that's why i and they call me the (17:24 - 17:27)
oddball this is what we gotta do (17:25 - 17:29)
we gotta start collecting digimon cards (17:27 - 17:31)
get them graded now (17:29 - 17:34)
no no no that digimon game is (17:31 - 17:36)
that is like a disaster waiting to (17:34 - 17:39)
happen i heard it's good (17:36 - 17:41)

impossible to find i i now have an (24:27 - 24:30)
incineroar amiibo (24:29 - 24:33)

anyone else (24:40 - 24:45)
you're you're going out the door i i'm (24:41 - 24:46)
i'll have to figure out how to get rid (24:45 - 24:48)
of them you like (24:46 - 24:51)
wheels i want these monster hunter (24:48 - 24:53)
amiibos they're impossible to find (24:51 - 24:56)
yeah you just can't find them (24:53 - 24:59)
although first clue uh (24:56 - 25:02)
buying them as individual amiibos i hate (24:59 - 25:04)
that these words are about to come out (25:02 - 25:06)
of my mouth (25:04 - 25:09)
gamestop exclusive yep (25:06 - 25:12)
so first off i'm not following amiibo (25:09 - 25:15)
news on twitter so when they tweet about (25:12 - 25:17)
amiibos being up i can click the link (25:15 - 25:17)
and then (25:17 - 25:21)
oh dang what what (25:17 - 25:22)
what are they even what what are the (25:21 - 25:24)
amiibos of the one's a dog (25:22 - 25:27)
one's the dog get one palamu one magnolo (25:24 - 25:29)
and one palico obviously (25:27 - 25:31)
and then once you have the the new (25:29 - 25:33)
monster and i think they give you (25:31 - 25:33)
exclusive (25:33 - 25:35)
outfits in the game when you scan them (25:33 - 25:38)
correct that are really cool (25:35 - 25:39)
okay that i was like and then you can (25:38 - 25:41)
use them in mario kart (25:39 - 25:43)
like yes the diddy kong amiibo and get (25:41 - 25:44)
me anything (25:43 - 25:46)
and try it i don't think it's ever got (25:44 - 25:48)
on there (25:46 - 25:48)
you could have got a diddy kong outfit (25:49 - 25:52)
you could have gotten a special diddy (25:50 - 25:54)
kong hunt where you hunt down the kong (25:52 - 25:55)
family (25:54 - 25:56)
kill them and carve them up for their (25:55 - 25:58)
pieces and then you wear (25:56 - 26:01)
funky kong's hat as a helmet you know i (25:58 - 26:02)
think monster hunter would sell (26:01 - 26:06)
even more if you could skin a funky kong (26:02 - 26:08)
and wear him as your outfit (26:06 - 26:12)
man if i could kill kongs (26:08 - 26:14)
get that good kong hunting okay can i i (26:12 - 26:15)

location they like closed down two of (27:13 - 27:17)
their stores hard times (27:14 - 27:17)
i talked about like two weeks ago i (27:18 - 27:21)
walked in they had battle styles and (27:19 - 27:22)
they were charging (27:21 - 27:26)
75 for an etb supply and demand (27:22 - 27:27)
so i went back into board game barrister (27:26 - 27:29)
this weekend i was like i need some more (27:27 - 27:30)
penny sleeves (27:29 - 27:32)
they didn't have any penny sleeves fine (27:30 - 27:33)
no big deal they had plenty of other (27:32 - 27:33)
sleeves (27:33 - 27:36)
i was only looking for penny um and then (27:33 - 27:37)
i saw they had (27:36 - 27:40)
uh uh uh an older sun and moon set (27:37 - 27:43)
on their shelf it was a three pack it (27:40 - 27:45)

steve in (29:40 - 29:47)
msu scam yes (29:43 - 29:51)
exactly uh the s is for (29:47 - 29:54)
suggested suggested not actual (29:51 - 29:59)
it's not mar or map (29:54 - 29:59)
they charged me 30 dollars (29:59 - 30:07)
triple the price wasn't even double (30:03 - 30:09)
it wasn't even 20. it wasn't 50 oh you (30:07 - 30:10)
know in my head when i was like give me (30:09 - 30:12)
one of those i was like i found it i (30:10 - 30:13)
don't have to worry about finding it (30:12 - 30:14)
online don't have to worry about (30:13 - 30:16)
shipping get the instant satisfaction (30:14 - 30:17)
like i know it's going to be more (30:16 - 30:17)
expensive (30:17 - 30:21)
maybe 15 maybe 20. 30 (30:17 - 30:23)
i'm taking it i'm returning it i haven't (30:21 - 30:24)
opened it i got the receipt i'm (30:23 - 30:28)
taking it back i can't but in the moment (30:24 - 30:32)
when they bring it to to get them where (30:28 - 30:34)
where no he doesn't really want them he (30:32 - 30:36)
was trying to be kind and generous and (30:34 - 30:38)
now he's going to get his money back and (30:36 - 30:39)
spend that money at mcdonald's where (30:38 - 30:41)
he'll get real value for his (30:39 - 30:44)
i want uh i want the alolans the (30:41 - 30:46)
the pack but when i but somebody was (30:44 - 30:48)
like oh my target had a bunch i i got a (30:46 - 30:52)
couple i'll send you one okay cool (30:48 - 30:52)
this is an issue though i agree because (30:52 - 30:56)
this is also an issue (30:54 - 30:58)
with the latest release for magic the (30:56 - 31:00)
gathering where (30:58 - 31:04)
the if you go to target you can get a (31:00 - 31:04)
pack for (31:04 - 31:06)
the pack price which i think for that (31:04 - 31:08)
one is six dollars and fifty cents if (31:06 - 31:10)
you go to your local game store you're (31:08 - 31:10)
not getting it (31:10 - 31:12)
if they even have any less for less than (31:10 - 31:15)
ten dollars and it's the same pack (31:12 - 31:18)
it's the same cards the barnes and noble (31:15 - 31:19)
which is (31:18 - 31:22)
like the same hallway as the barrister (31:19 - 31:24)
because again when will saw me in june (31:22 - 31:26)
we went to barnes noble (31:24 - 31:27)
it's in the same mall it's like less (31:26 - 31:29)
than 45 seconds they have tons of (31:27 - 31:32)
pokemon cards behind the counter (31:29 - 31:35)
msr actual msrp you you know limit two (31:32 - 31:37)
you know go back to your car put a wig (31:35 - 31:38)
on come back in get another two i mean (31:37 - 31:39)
it's fine (31:38 - 31:41)
um just wait till the employees rotate (31:39 - 31:42)
it doesn't matter (31:41 - 31:47)
but they got they have (31:42 - 31:49)
yeah i'm eager to see your collection of (31:47 - 31:52)
wigs so you can scan the bars noble (31:49 - 31:55)
i have all these wigs and glasses and (31:52 - 31:57)
noses that i put on so i can get (31:55 - 32:00)
more than my two packs of pokemon (31:57 - 32:00)
walking (32:00 - 32:03)
in two blister packs is more than enough (32:00 - 32:03)
for me (32:03 - 32:06)
i it is it is (32:03 - 32:11)
bold to charge three times the price (32:06 - 32:14)
of ultimately like there is nothing of (32:11 - 32:15)
value (32:14 - 32:17)
in this they just get value of any of (32:15 - 32:19)
them well (32:17 - 32:20)
you put it in there yeah in shining (32:19 - 32:22)
fates you can pull 500 (32:20 - 32:24)
charizard right no no no but still no no (32:22 - 32:26)
no in shining fates at least you have (32:24 - 32:27)
cards you can play (32:26 - 32:29)
these extra large cards you can't even (32:27 - 32:31)
play them unless you're playing (32:29 - 32:33)
a large card you're saying that i didn't (32:31 - 32:35)
want to pay extra for collector's items (32:33 - 32:37)
a thing that i can't even use (32:35 - 32:40)
a thing that is in high demand i think (32:37 - 32:42)
that larger chains get (32:40 - 32:44)
uh more access to apply to so barnes (32:42 - 32:45)
noble has a completely different (32:44 - 32:47)
distribution method than a local game (32:45 - 32:48)
store does (32:47 - 32:50)
so they have to eke out what's left (32:48 - 32:52)
after the giant corporations get it and (32:50 - 32:53)
you're waltzing in here saying (32:52 - 32:56)
i'm down with my local store that is (32:53 - 32:59)
fighting to survive against these giant (32:56 - 33:01)
corporations like dartmouth (32:59 - 33:03)
paris has darris has been overcharging (33:01 - 33:04)
people for years (33:03 - 33:06)
yeah but they had to close two locations (33:04 - 33:07)
you just said it (33:06 - 33:09)
was over here way in packs as well (33:07 - 33:11)
that's why i can't (33:09 - 33:14)
look if they want (33:11 - 33:16)
look what what am i looking at i'm (33:14 - 33:18)
looking at a scam artist with wigs in (33:16 - 33:20)
his car so you can rip off of barnes and (33:18 - 33:21)
noble is what i'm looking at (33:20 - 33:23)
i'm not ripping off bar i'm not buying (33:21 - 33:25)
poor mr yeah (33:23 - 33:28)
mr noble doesn't have food for his table (33:25 - 33:31)
when when oh me when i guess it's just (33:28 - 33:33)
how i would resell stuff like when (33:31 - 33:36)
when animal crossing was real hot don't (33:33 - 33:38)
you laugh at me when animal crossing was (33:36 - 33:38)
real hot (33:38 - 33:41)
remember this back a year ago a year ago (33:38 - 33:41)
exactly (33:41 - 33:44)
a year ago it was it was hot and sweaty (33:41 - 33:45)
people were all over (33:44 - 33:48)
animal crossing i was sitting on a gold (33:45 - 33:49)
mine of animal crossing tcg (33:48 - 33:53)
carts the amiibo cards i had i had all (33:49 - 33:54)
the good ones too (33:53 - 33:57)
i had the marshalls i had the the (33:54 - 33:57)
julians (33:57 - 33:59)
i had i had everything that people (33:57 - 34:01)
wanted and (33:59 - 34:05)
i had zero desire to use these cards (34:01 - 34:07)
like i i collected them i didn't have (34:05 - 34:09)
the full set i was like you know what (34:07 - 34:12)
and then and then people who like my (34:09 - 34:14)
content (34:12 - 34:16)
they were like can we buy these off you (34:14 - 34:17)
and i was like i don't even know how (34:16 - 34:18)
much they are (34:17 - 34:20)
and like the marshall card at the time (34:18 - 34:23)
was going for 80 on ebay (34:20 - 34:26)
and i couldn't in good faith (34:23 - 34:29)
sell these cards at what ebay was (34:26 - 34:29)
charging (34:29 - 34:32)
to people who support my content and i (34:29 - 34:33)
think i ended up selling marshall for (34:32 - 34:35)
like half the cost i was like (34:33 - 34:39)
i'm like i just felt awful (34:35 - 34:42)
and so like my mindset of going into a (34:39 - 34:42)
barrister (34:42 - 34:45)
i don't mind paying a little bit extra (34:42 - 34:47)
for something to get it right now (34:45 - 34:51)
but three times the price for (34:47 - 34:53)
ultimately just a silly collector's item (34:51 - 34:54)
that will not be worth (34:53 - 34:57)
anything oh it is that's all it is (34:54 - 34:59)
like i understand the the like it's hard (34:57 - 35:01)
to keep shining fates on shelves (34:59 - 35:04)
it is not hard right now to keep battle (35:01 - 35:05)
styles on shelves because this is what i (35:04 - 35:07)
said battle styles is not a particularly (35:05 - 35:08)
good set (35:07 - 35:10)
when when you open up this galler (35:08 - 35:11)
starter pack (35:10 - 35:12)
you get two booster packs you don't know (35:11 - 35:14)
what booster packs you are one of them (35:12 - 35:15)
is guaranteed sun and moon (35:14 - 35:17)
there's nothing in sun and moon that is (35:15 - 35:19)
worth more than like ten dollars there's (35:17 - 35:20)
like a full art lily that's maybe worth (35:19 - 35:21)
like 16 (35:20 - 35:23)
everything in this booster pack you're (35:21 - 35:25)
better off keeping this booster pack (35:23 - 35:26)
sealed and then putting it next to your (35:25 - 35:28)
hmu because if you open it (35:26 - 35:30)
you're gonna get 45 cents worth of value (35:28 - 35:32)
out of this and that comes in this (35:30 - 35:35)
so there the 30 for whatever the alolan (35:32 - 35:36)
i don't even know where it is it's my (35:35 - 35:38)
floor right now the the lowland starter (35:36 - 35:40)
i'm sure it comes with another sun and (35:38 - 35:42)
moon because they got to get rid of (35:40 - 35:42)
these (35:42 - 35:46)
it's all bad i can't like you're paying (35:42 - 35:47)
thirty dollars for ultimately two (35:46 - 35:49)
booster packs and three oversized jumbo (35:47 - 35:50)
cards that aren't worth anything (35:49 - 35:52)
and you paid it well he's going to (35:50 - 35:54)
return it because i hate it (35:52 - 35:57)
the problem is he didn't ask this is the (35:54 - 36:00)
problem that's real problem to learn (35:57 - 36:03)
is ask how much something costs before (36:00 - 36:05)
you make the purchase (36:03 - 36:08)
but you've like you've also just made me (36:05 - 36:09)
a salty customer (36:08 - 36:12)
of the audacity of charging (36:09 - 36:15)
that much you are only a salty customer (36:12 - 36:16)
because (36:15 - 36:17)
you have a group of people that are (36:16 - 36:19)
saying i have all of these others you (36:17 - 36:21)
have a group of people that said i got (36:19 - 36:22)
one at target for free (36:21 - 36:25)
if you had been spending all day (36:22 - 36:27)
searching your targets and you didn't (36:25 - 36:28)
find one (36:27 - 36:29)
and they finally had when you this is (36:28 - 36:31)
the last place you went and you really (36:29 - 36:32)
wanted this (36:31 - 36:34)
he'd be like yeah 30 bucks sounds (36:32 - 36:37)
reasonable for the amount of time (36:34 - 36:38)
i can go on cool stuff thinking get it (36:37 - 36:40)
right now for 20. the only difference is (36:38 - 36:41)
i gotta wait for like four four days for (36:40 - 36:43)
it to arrive (36:41 - 36:47)
yeah you're paying for instant now (36:43 - 36:49)
that's the thing they have it in stock (36:47 - 36:50)
taking up their space (36:49 - 36:52)
right now and that's the thing i think (36:50 - 36:54)
it's not the it's not like the base (36:52 - 36:55)
value (36:54 - 36:57)
it's it's the fact that it's three times (36:55 - 36:59)
the price so it was like a (36:57 - 37:03)
like i got news for you about clothing (36:59 - 37:06)
you know like if it was if it was (37:03 - 37:08)
even even something like uh the etb (37:06 - 37:09)
which is forty dollars and they're (37:08 - 37:11)
charging seventy five dollars for that's (37:09 - 37:12)
not technically double the price it's (37:11 - 37:14)
close (37:12 - 37:17)
but three times the price for this is is (37:14 - 37:19)
i don't know it's unbelievable well it's (37:17 - 37:20)
too far for you but it's not (37:19 - 37:22)
unbelievable for a lot of you yeah (37:20 - 37:24)
just you gotta you gotta believe it (37:22 - 37:26)
because that's where we are in the world (37:24 - 37:28)
right now we won't be here in a year (37:26 - 37:28)
from now (37:28 - 37:31)
yeah i mean they're they are in a tough (37:28 - 37:32)
spot (37:31 - 37:34)
hustling as best they can what if (37:32 - 37:35)
they're fighting against (37:34 - 37:37)
online vendors who are willing to cut (37:35 - 37:39)
things in half because online vendors (37:37 - 37:40)
have a vast (37:39 - 37:42)
network of people that they can get (37:40 - 37:44)
cards from that small (37:42 - 37:46)
shops generally don't have i don't think (37:44 - 37:47)
they're a small shop though i think they (37:46 - 37:47)
get (37:47 - 37:50)
i think they get plenty of how many (37:47 - 37:51)
locations are there (37:50 - 37:54)
in the in the united states right now (37:51 - 37:56)
they had three in the milwaukee look at (37:54 - 37:59)
that and how many are left (37:56 - 38:01)
one so what is your definition of a (37:59 - 38:04)
small shop if it's not a single shop (38:01 - 38:07)
in one city in america i mean as long as (38:04 - 38:08)
they're (38:07 - 38:09)
as long as they're treating their (38:08 - 38:12)
distributors like like (38:09 - 38:14)
this distribution is is more so like (38:12 - 38:16)
having a long relationship with somebody (38:14 - 38:18)
and then fulfilling the orders (38:16 - 38:20)
like you can yeah but the amount that (38:18 - 38:23)
you can order (38:20 - 38:23)
still even the same distribute (38:24 - 38:28)
distributor will give different prices (38:26 - 38:29)
to a much larger chain because (38:28 - 38:31)
they can they can order more so they get (38:29 - 38:32)
a better discount (38:31 - 38:36)
than a single shopkin like diamond (38:32 - 38:36)
comics (38:36 - 38:38)
can sell cheaper to a chain than the (38:36 - 38:41)
local mom and pop store no no (38:38 - 38:44)
i understand all of that right i (38:41 - 38:46)
understand that they may only get (38:44 - 38:50)
you know 200 etbs versus a target which (38:46 - 38:51)
gets (38:50 - 38:53)
you know 2 million etbs not all their (38:51 - 38:55)
stores i get that (38:53 - 38:59)
my complaint my core complaint is (38:55 - 39:00)
they're blatantly ripping off the (38:59 - 39:03)
customers that keep coming to that store (39:00 - 39:04)
instead of just being like put up a (39:03 - 39:06)
limit of like (39:04 - 39:10)
one pokemon per item and lower the price (39:06 - 39:12)
instead of trying to make a huge profit (39:10 - 39:13)
off the people who (39:12 - 39:17)
are trying to support you but they have (39:13 - 39:20)
that they have they have four they are (39:17 - 39:23)
counting on hopefully getting (39:20 - 39:25)
four people to come into their shop (39:23 - 39:27)
which may not happen (39:25 - 39:30)
to limit that product i mean they may (39:27 - 39:31)
only sell one a week (39:30 - 39:34)
because one person stops by their store (39:31 - 39:35)
and they have made an investment that (39:34 - 39:36)
they need to move (39:35 - 39:39)
at a price they need to price it at to (39:36 - 39:40)
to still make a profit (39:39 - 39:43)
because traffic is down and they don't (39:40 - 39:45)
have a thousand people going to a target (39:43 - 39:46)
who might buy it on impulse they have (39:45 - 39:48)
people who are specifically (39:46 - 39:50)
going out of their way to go to a board (39:48 - 39:51)
game store (39:50 - 39:53)
in a pandemic where there is one (39:51 - 39:55)
location (39:53 - 39:57)
they have to make the choices they have (39:55 - 40:00)
to make you don't have to buy it (39:57 - 40:02)
but i'm not going to knock them for the (40:00 - 40:03)
business price of their own price for (40:02 - 40:05)
charging and ripping off their core (40:03 - 40:07)
customers that's true that's (40:05 - 40:08)
that's kind of true that's kind of where (40:07 - 40:10)
my thoughts were going is like (40:08 - 40:12)
maybe they need to keep in mind that if (40:10 - 40:14)
they (40:12 - 40:16)
have better prices they would have more (40:14 - 40:17)
traffic through their store (40:16 - 40:20)
i mean their location is in a mall (40:17 - 40:24)
it's not out of the way good mall (40:20 - 40:27)
it's not a bad mall i mean i mean we're (40:24 - 40:29)
not talking brookfield square we're (40:27 - 40:30)
talking right yeah (40:29 - 40:32)
exactly we're talking mayfair here is (40:30 - 40:34)

being associated with (40:44 - 40:50)

skateboarding anime that's actually not (44:44 - 44:46)

like hard mewtwo or zero aura or is it a (50:48 - 50:52)
little tricky (50:51 - 50:53)
but that's pretty easy those aren't (50:52 - 50:55)
bunnies (50:53 - 50:57)
i mean you're right you couldn't catch (50:55 - 51:01)
you couldn't catch the cinder race (50:57 - 51:03)

it gave 6xl (51:03 - 51:07)
and then 6l and the other rewards it (51:04 - 51:08)
normally gave (51:07 - 51:10)
so it was it was quick it like i would (51:08 - 51:11)
say the cinder race was easier than the (51:10 - 51:13)
azumarill zoomer was real (51:11 - 51:16)
thick it took a took a while to knock (51:13 - 51:18)

thought of you the entire time yeah (53:12 - 53:19)
uh i mean i got i got iris and i have (53:15 - 53:21)
i got diantha twice which brings you (53:19 - 53:22)
know power (53:21 - 53:26)
oh you got iris nice uh and then (53:22 - 53:30)
who did i get just randomly (53:26 - 53:32)
oh i got bianca for i'm like oh i didn't (53:30 - 53:34)
have bianca okay (53:32 - 53:38)
this is literally one that nobody uses (53:34 - 53:39)
yeah but now you got it for your (53:38 - 53:40)
collection yeah well that's right (53:39 - 53:42)
digital collection (53:40 - 53:46)
i pulled a lot on may i ended up getting (53:42 - 53:47)
peers (53:46 - 53:50)
which is cool um but no may (53:47 - 53:52)
so i'll pull again like a week or two i (53:50 - 53:55)
gotta i gotta save some more (53:52 - 53:58)
uh the easter event is (53:55 - 54:01)
fine yeah it's i guess (53:58 - 54:04)
okay is diantha the easter event no (54:01 - 54:05)
she's the (54:04 - 54:12)
1.5 anniversary event uh the (54:05 - 54:16)
i'm not a huge fan of the fact that (54:12 - 54:17)
like in previous events you could just (54:16 - 54:19)
go to the lower levels and get all the (54:17 - 54:20)
eggs (54:19 - 54:22)
all you needed and you know they use (54:20 - 54:24)
them in various combinations (54:22 - 54:27)
this time they added a high-end lucario (54:24 - 54:29)
rate that you can only get from the (54:27 - 54:31)
ultra hard battle or you can trade in (54:29 - 54:33)
lower ones at a really bad (54:31 - 54:36)
rate lower lucario's (54:33 - 54:38)
yeah so there's different eggs there's (54:36 - 54:41)
beniri eggs and torchic eggs and togepi (54:38 - 54:42)
eggs (54:41 - 54:45)
and you can combine them to make lucario (54:42 - 54:47)
eggs (54:45 - 54:49)
are we talking about masters yeah what (54:47 - 54:50)
where (54:49 - 54:53)
what what what do you mean where (54:50 - 54:56)
okay are you talking about the easter (54:53 - 54:57)
event they just added (54:56 - 54:59)
yeah oh i haven't done that yet i (54:57 - 55:00)
thought you were talking about the like (54:59 - 55:02)
iggly buff eggs that they added we (55:00 - 55:03)
talked about like last week is that (55:02 - 55:05)
where like everybody puts in (55:03 - 55:07)
one egg and then you like spin it and (55:05 - 55:08)
then it keeps (55:07 - 55:10)
hitting the spin and then everybody gets (55:08 - 55:11)
a random egg out of it (55:10 - 55:13)
i wish because you're talking about (55:11 - 55:15)
remember when pokemon was fun (55:13 - 55:18)
yeah yeah it was when things were (55:15 - 55:20)
reasonably repriced and not triple (55:18 - 55:24)
is it oh is this who we've become yeah (55:20 - 55:29)
they are old pokemon complainers (55:24 - 55:29)
bringing back mini games in pokemon (55:29 - 55:33)
games man (55:32 - 55:35)
are we talking about passions egg (55:33 - 55:36)
explorers (55:35 - 55:39)
yes okay i haven't done that yet and you (55:36 - 55:40)
said it's okay (55:39 - 55:41)
uh i mean the event is fine like the (55:40 - 55:43)
story is (55:41 - 55:47)
fine it's a it's it's a it's it's (55:43 - 55:48)
i think it's one of their weaker (55:47 - 55:50)
storylines but do me do me a favor and (55:48 - 55:54)
go into the exchange items (55:50 - 55:54)
um (55:54 - 55:57)
i see togepi egg banary egg oh yeah (55:59 - 56:05)
okay i see that exchange items is under (56:03 - 56:07)
store right yep (56:05 - 56:10)
gotta go to trisha real quick wait till (56:07 - 56:12)
they give her a pokemon (56:10 - 56:16)
yeah why doesn't she have a pokemon (56:12 - 56:20)
50 lucario eggs gets you okay (56:16 - 56:23)
300 lucario eggs gets you the tech move (56:20 - 56:23)
candy (56:23 - 56:27)
yeah or the support move candy (56:23 - 56:30)
or the strike move candy but if you go (56:27 - 56:32)
down (56:30 - 56:34)
you'll see that you can get lucario eggs (56:32 - 56:36)
by doing an exchange at a terrible (56:34 - 56:39)
terrible rate (56:36 - 56:39)
oh i see so you can do 40 togepi and 20 (56:39 - 56:45)
banary for 10 lucario (56:43 - 56:48)
yep doesn't seem uh (56:45 - 56:51)
did you see how much it costs to get (56:48 - 56:54)
the tech move it's 300 or karaoke to get (56:51 - 56:55)
a coin (56:54 - 56:57)
yeah but the coins are bad you want the (56:55 - 56:58)
candy the candy is good right (56:57 - 57:02)
the candies 200 yeah but 200 is not (56:58 - 57:05)
that bad (57:02 - 57:05)
how long does it take to get a lucario (57:05 - 57:10)
egg uh i've been doing this let me see (57:07 - 57:13)
let me try to do an exchange uh (57:10 - 57:16)
18 days that's a lot of time right now (57:13 - 57:18)
i've been playing since this event was (57:16 - 57:18)
done (57:18 - 57:20)
doing just the bare minimum and i can (57:18 - 57:22)
get exactly (57:20 - 57:27)
20 lucario eggs from my time put in (57:22 - 57:30)
so just do that ten more times yeah and (57:27 - 57:33)
then you got eight days left over (57:30 - 57:33)
don't give me that look that's logic (57:34 - 57:37)
greg (57:37 - 57:39)
logic we'll figure it out i'll do it (57:37 - 57:41)
i'll do it we'll come we'll circle back (57:39 - 57:43)
on it next week (57:41 - 57:46)
sometimes i feel like masters is by the (57:43 - 57:46)
way (57:46 - 57:49)
full disclosure uh partnered with dna (57:46 - 57:52)
i feel like some times masters is too (57:49 - 57:54)
generous with their exchange rates (57:52 - 57:58)
uh i have never seen that what the last (57:54 - 58:01)
event it was like super easy to do it (57:58 - 58:04)
it was the um it was like the gallery (58:01 - 58:05)
event (58:04 - 58:06)
the gallery event was like super easy to (58:05 - 58:08)
get everything (58:06 - 58:11)
yeah but why is that a bad thing i mean (58:08 - 58:13)
you still had to play it every day to be (58:11 - 58:14)
able to get everything on that list (58:13 - 58:16)
oh i did it well i don't want everything (58:14 - 58:17)
on the list i only want like the top (58:16 - 58:19)
four items because everything else on (58:17 - 58:20)
the list is like stuff i have a million (58:19 - 58:21)
of (58:20 - 58:24)
yeah but that's not everybody okay yeah (58:21 - 58:25)
but if you just want the top (58:24 - 58:27)
items it took me like three days to get (58:25 - 58:28)
everything okay (58:27 - 58:31)
i don't want to spend why is that a bad (58:28 - 58:32)
thing (58:31 - 58:34)
no that that because then you're then (58:32 - 58:36)
you're like i have nothing to do (58:34 - 58:38)
you don't have nothing to do you have a (58:36 - 58:40)
lot of other things to do in that game (58:38 - 58:41)
if you want (58:40 - 58:43)
like what you're saying is i don't want (58:41 - 58:44)
to i (58:43 - 58:46)
i want to spend all of my time playing (58:44 - 58:48)
this special event in this special event (58:46 - 58:50)
only and not doing any of the other (58:48 - 58:51)
things in that game (58:50 - 58:54)
um i would say that's what it feels like (58:51 - 58:55)
with this egg (58:54 - 58:58)
with the exploration event i would say (58:55 - 59:00)
like a lot of the masters events (58:58 - 59:02)
aren't compelling enough for two weeks (59:00 - 59:04)
of repetition (59:02 - 59:06)
i would say they're compelling enough (59:04 - 59:08)
for like a week of repetition (59:06 - 59:10)
but i don't mind them lasting two weeks (59:08 - 59:12)
because (59:10 - 59:14)
because i might miss the first like five (59:12 - 59:17)
days but i mean repetition is (59:14 - 59:18)
with an asterisk because once you (59:17 - 59:20)
complete it once you just skip ticket it (59:18 - 59:21)
and you have (59:20 - 59:24)
at this point i have five thousand skips (59:21 - 59:26)
i mean i'm literally not spending any of (59:24 - 59:27)
my time (59:26 - 59:30)
doing these events but saying skip (59:27 - 59:32)
ticket it ten times (59:30 - 59:34)
so that gets back to my fundamental (59:32 - 59:36)
question of (59:34 - 59:39)
are you actually playing this game or (59:36 - 59:43)
uh i mean i play the event the first (59:39 - 59:44)
time to (59:43 - 59:46)
complete it and then once i've completed (59:44 - 59:48)
it i don't need to prove to the game (59:46 - 59:51)
500 more times that i know how to defeat (59:48 - 59:52)
their puzzle (59:51 - 59:56)
i don't get it look this isn't a garden (59:52 - 59:58)
scapes where they repeat puzzles and it (59:56 - 59:58)
doesn't (59:58 - 60:01)
like they don't (59:58 - 60:01)
there's only so many ways the jewels can (60:03 - 60:06)
fall (60:06 - 60:09)
you'd be surprised and it's not (60:06 - 60:12)
jewels what is it flowers i think i (60:09 - 60:13)
think the thing you might be missing (60:12 - 60:15)
about masters will (60:13 - 60:18)
is there's there's always like four (60:15 - 60:20)
levels of difficulty (60:18 - 60:22)
there's like the easy that you do once (60:20 - 60:24)
and then never again there's the normal (60:22 - 60:25)
that you do once and then never again (60:24 - 60:26)
and then there's the (60:25 - 60:29)
hard that you do once and then you then (60:26 - 60:32)
you pour your skip tickets into it (60:29 - 60:35)
and then there's like a very hard (60:32 - 60:36)
there's ultra hard (60:35 - 60:38)
or whatever it's called that i almost (60:36 - 60:40)
never do i never (60:38 - 60:43)
do it because it is super hard and it (60:40 - 60:45)
requires you to like (60:43 - 60:48)
plan because instead of like one battle (60:45 - 60:48)
of (60:48 - 60:51)
three v three which is mo like which is (60:48 - 60:52)
not 99 (60:51 - 60:55)
of masters it's a nine verse nine battle (60:52 - 60:57)
yeah so you will get knocked out with (60:55 - 60:59)
your three (60:57 - 61:02)
and then you're allowed six more and you (60:59 - 61:03)
have their remaining team (61:02 - 61:05)
so you go back in for a second time and (61:03 - 61:07)
then so you (61:05 - 61:09)
actually have to like strategize what (61:07 - 61:10)
nine pokemon (61:09 - 61:12)
you're gonna bring who is going to open (61:10 - 61:14)
yep and then (61:12 - 61:16)
if you get knocked out you need to like (61:14 - 61:18)
strategize okay i need to bring in a (61:16 - 61:20)
pokemon to clear these statuses (61:18 - 61:21)
because they'll remember all their (61:20 - 61:23)
boosts from last time and i'm going in (61:21 - 61:23)
fresh (61:23 - 61:27)
yeah so that whole battle takes a a lot (61:23 - 61:28)
of planning and (61:27 - 61:30)
it it's very grindy and there's there is (61:28 - 61:31)
trial and error you're probably going to (61:30 - 61:33)
fail the first three words must be (61:31 - 61:33)
tremendous (61:33 - 61:36)
they aren't that it's they're okay (61:33 - 61:37)
they're okay (61:36 - 61:39)
i mean they are they are hard to get (61:37 - 61:41)
rewards (61:39 - 61:43)
i mean the other thing that they do is (61:41 - 61:45)
that you have to have nine (61:43 - 61:47)
a lot of times you have to have them at (61:45 - 61:50)
the very top level so the 130 (61:47 - 61:53)
level cap so you need to find nine that (61:50 - 61:56)
you have dumped all your resources in (61:53 - 61:59)
that like if you picked your knife to do (61:56 - 62:00)
that too because that's a lot of (61:59 - 62:02)
resources (62:00 - 62:05)
they may not be worth anything when (62:02 - 62:07)
you're fighting this particular ultra (62:05 - 62:09)
hard one so (62:07 - 62:10)
the ultra hard stuff is very much a (62:09 - 62:12)
grind that i am not into (62:10 - 62:15)
i just i i don't want to have to sit (62:12 - 62:16)
down and (62:15 - 62:19)
like plan out half an hour of (62:16 - 62:21)
what night i mean i don't know what it (62:19 - 62:24)
sounds like playing in the game (62:21 - 62:26)
yeah that's 100 playing the game but it (62:24 - 62:28)
is like (62:26 - 62:31)
i mean it's not (62:28 - 62:31)
it it's like saying that savage (62:31 - 62:36)
difficulty raids in final fantasy 14 (62:33 - 62:38)
is playing the game it's not like you (62:36 - 62:41)
can still get that exact same experience (62:38 - 62:44)
from the normal encounter raids savage (62:41 - 62:46)
has (62:44 - 62:48)
improved difficulty but that's not (62:46 - 62:49)
playing the game (62:48 - 62:52)
any better or more so this is my issue (62:49 - 62:53)
playing the difficult (62:52 - 62:56)
is playing the ultra difficult for (62:53 - 62:57)
questionable rewards (62:56 - 63:01)
so this this is kind of my my approach (62:57 - 63:03)
to kind of looking at this kind of a (63:01 - 63:05)
thing for (63:03 - 63:07)
games like doom where i want to play (63:05 - 63:08)
them for the story (63:07 - 63:11)
then i do them on the lowest difficulty (63:08 - 63:12)
that's something of a joke because (63:11 - 63:15)
obviously doom has no story (63:12 - 63:19)
for games like pokemon masters which (63:15 - 63:22)
has no story it has a story everywhere (63:19 - 63:23)
has a story (63:22 - 63:26)
sorry it has a story mode (63:23 - 63:26)
really it does it does first story (63:27 - 63:34)
runs away during the egg event and it's (63:31 - 63:36)
mixed in with all the eggs (63:34 - 63:38)
i will i will never fault masters for (63:36 - 63:39)
having (63:38 - 63:41)
like actually the best silver and (63:39 - 63:43)
giovanni storyline (63:41 - 63:46)
that the main series game couldn't even (63:43 - 63:46)
bother (63:46 - 63:48)
telling the interact one of the best (63:46 - 63:51)
part of masters is the storyline and the (63:48 - 63:53)
interactions that they have between the (63:51 - 63:53)
trainers (63:53 - 63:57)
the rest is okay to get the story (63:53 - 63:58)
without really trying (63:57 - 64:00)
how yeah yeah you just look at (63:58 - 64:01)
screenshots (64:00 - 64:04)
well i mean so all of the the stories (64:01 - 64:05)
are always (64:04 - 64:07)
just getting through the low-level (64:05 - 64:09)
content and the low-level content is (64:07 - 64:10)
really easy to get through (64:09 - 64:13)
so you just do the normal difficulties (64:10 - 64:15)
to just get the storyline out of the way (64:13 - 64:18)
and then to collect the rewards it's the (64:15 - 64:20)
hard and ultra hard content (64:18 - 64:22)
if you want the rewards and the rewards (64:20 - 64:23)
part (64:22 - 64:27)
that's questionable like each each event (64:23 - 64:29)
may or may not give you things of worth (64:27 - 64:31)
that are (64:29 - 64:35)
that are easy or fun to get so (64:31 - 64:39)
yeah we'd know that diantha is our lgbtq (64:35 - 64:40)
queen she is (64:39 - 64:44)
if it wasn't for pokemon story she doubt (64:40 - 64:47)
and she is and she's amazing and also (64:44 - 64:48)
how do we know (64:47 - 64:50)
about wallace and steve on their (64:48 - 64:51)
honeymoon (64:50 - 64:54)
out in out looking for stones if it (64:51 - 64:57)
wasn't for the storyline (64:54 - 65:00)
how would we know about how capes (64:57 - 65:03)
and champions work if it wasn't for the (65:00 - 65:04)
storyline (65:03 - 65:07)
one of the best storyline moments in the (65:04 - 65:08)
game (65:07 - 65:10)
how will we know hilbert's secret hobby (65:08 - 65:11)
if it wasn't for the halloween event and (65:10 - 65:12)
pokemon (65:11 - 65:15)
secret hobby (65:12 - 65:15)
secret hobby you know he dressed up as a (65:16 - 65:19)
werewolf and (65:18 - 65:21)
oh that's right living the dream he's (65:19 - 65:24)
living the dream as a werewolf (65:21 - 65:24)
there's a lot of stream the stories the (65:25 - 65:29)
stories are the stories of masters (65:27 - 65:31)
are absurd and they're the greatest (65:29 - 65:32)
thing of that game it's the one thing (65:31 - 65:34)
that keeps me coming back (65:32 - 65:37)
because you just have no idea this most (65:34 - 65:37)
current (65:37 - 65:39)
the easter story line is not great (65:37 - 65:41)
there's no real great moments in there (65:39 - 65:44)
well i mean they're using berg and he's (65:41 - 65:46)
well they're using mate the story (65:44 - 65:48)
centers are on may and brandon being all (65:46 - 65:51)
dramatic with each other and wally shows (65:48 - 65:54)
up for not enough time (65:51 - 65:54)
man that cyrus story line was pretty (65:54 - 65:58)
awesome the cyrus storyline was great (65:56 - 65:59)
like okay (65:58 - 66:01)
you're still a person that wants to (65:59 - 66:03)
murder everybody in the world but why (66:01 - 66:04)
don't you work out with us (66:03 - 66:08)
i guess i'll destroy the world later (66:04 - 66:12)
shouldn't he be taken somewhere (66:08 - 66:14)
he literally states multiple times that (66:12 - 66:16)
he wants to blow up the entire universe (66:14 - 66:19)
he was taken somewhere passio yeah (66:16 - 66:20)
i didn't pass you i was like i'm still (66:19 - 66:23)
gonna blow everything up but i i guess (66:20 - 66:24)
i'll hang out (66:23 - 66:26)
for a while (66:24 - 66:26)
uh okay last bit of news here (66:31 - 66:39)
is pokemon go uh so the referral program (66:35 - 66:43)
is available now it's worldwide (66:39 - 66:46)
um you can refer a friend by going to (66:43 - 66:47)
your friend's stream (66:46 - 66:51)
a friend screen or stream maybe i don't (66:47 - 66:52)
know (66:51 - 66:54)
you tap the invite and then you share (66:52 - 66:55)
the code (66:54 - 66:58)
with somebody who has never played pogo (66:55 - 67:02)
or somebody who hasn't played in 90 days (66:58 - 67:06)
my only response to that is thanks irene (67:02 - 67:06)
i'm going to be letting her not in 90 (67:07 - 67:11)
days she hasn't opened it since the (67:09 - 67:11)
kanto (67:11 - 67:15)
event so set that timer (67:11 - 67:18)
uh once they import the code either (67:15 - 67:19)
during the sign up process or in the (67:18 - 67:21)
front screen later you will both receive (67:19 - 67:23)
rewards as your friends reach milestones (67:21 - 67:24)
on their journey you'll both receive (67:23 - 67:26)
more rewards make sure to help them all (67:24 - 67:27)
out (67:26 - 67:31)
out along the way what are the rewards (67:27 - 67:36)
um they're pretty good (67:31 - 67:36)
did they specify somewhere because i (67:36 - 67:39)
didn't look but (67:38 - 67:42)
not online in the news article yeah (67:39 - 67:43)
because it says the receive rewards (67:42 - 67:45)
like pokemon encounters rare candy and (67:43 - 67:47)
incubators and (67:45 - 67:49)
more (67:47 - 67:49)
incubators i could use (67:50 - 67:58)
i don't have a list of the rewards but (68:02 - 68:05)
there are (68:04 - 68:08)
youtubers and websites that (68:05 - 68:10)
have the list of all they are like one (68:08 - 68:12)
of them is gibbel i know (68:10 - 68:14)
gibbel will spawn for both people i (68:12 - 68:15)
hatched a gibble the other day (68:14 - 68:16)
there's like stardust there's like (68:15 - 68:19)
exclusive stickers stardust i do not (68:16 - 68:24)
need stickers oh here we go (68:19 - 68:27)
so if you referred somebody so you would (68:24 - 68:29)
be inviting somebody else (68:27 - 68:31)
uh one you would get a gallerian (68:29 - 68:33)
farfetch you would get a bag on a (68:31 - 68:34)
darmaka (68:33 - 68:37)
charizard dino gibble 50 mega energy (68:34 - 68:39)
raid pass three incense two super (68:37 - 68:42)
incubators 30 rare candy (68:39 - 68:44)
five super incubators uh 10 pikachu (68:42 - 68:46)
stickers 10 pidgey stickers (68:44 - 68:49)
and then if you were the person that was (68:46 - 68:51)
referred (68:49 - 68:52)
if you were the one new to pokemon go (68:51 - 68:54)
you would get a raid pass a super (68:52 - 68:56)
incubator charizard chansey (68:54 - 68:59)
mega energy fiverr candy lapras three (68:56 - 69:01)

raid passes a snorlax a lapras (69:01 - 69:06)
um 10 pikachu stickers 10 pidgey (69:03 - 69:08)
stickers so i think the rewards are (69:06 - 69:09)
pretty all right (69:08 - 69:12)
yeah it's pretty good i mean i don't (69:09 - 69:13)
think anyone's going to complain for (69:12 - 69:15)
getting a gimbal by recommending (69:13 - 69:21)
somebody seems pretty good (69:15 - 69:24)
and then uh the easter event is (69:21 - 69:28)
happening in pogo right now (69:24 - 69:28)
is it because i only saw a mana this (69:30 - 69:36)

that's speaking of events that's (69:58 - 70:05)
just another event they'll (70:02 - 70:09)
they'll all seem fine but that's your (70:05 - 70:11)
pokemon go minute (70:09 - 70:11)
i think that's all our news we're (70:14 - 70:18)
probably forgetting something but uh (70:15 - 70:19)
we need to save something for next week (70:18 - 70:21)
so that's fine (70:19 - 70:26)
that's true yeah we need to store it up (70:21 - 70:26)
oh did we call for question of the week (70:27 - 70:31)
yes oh yeah yeah yeah (70:28 - 70:34)
what's the question of the week (70:31 - 70:37)
won't you give us something to talk (70:34 - 70:40)
about (70:37 - 70:40)
i almost kind of maybe (70:41 - 70:48)
[Laughter] (70:44 - 70:48)
almost kind of maybe yeah i'm not quite (70:48 - 70:53)
sure what it was (70:51 - 70:53)
brandon says what are your favorite and (70:54 - 70:57)
least favorite puzzles in mainline (70:56 - 70:58)
series (70:57 - 71:02)
games i dislike (70:58 - 71:07)
most of the pushing rock puzzles (71:02 - 71:07)
oh those are bad i just they're either (71:07 - 71:12)
they're (71:11 - 71:15)
on multiple levels which just is just a (71:12 - 71:16)
pain (71:15 - 71:20)
to to remember where you are and then (71:16 - 71:21)
if you didn't do it right they reset or (71:20 - 71:24)
they don't reset (71:21 - 71:26)
i all the rock pushing puzzles are my (71:24 - 71:28)
least favorite puzzles (71:26 - 71:30)
period also they're always in caves so (71:28 - 71:32)
it's like zubat central (71:30 - 71:34)
it's just it's just annoying from (71:32 - 71:35)
beginning to end (71:34 - 71:40)
i do not like them uh favorite (71:35 - 71:43)
i liked the cannon i don't think it was (71:40 - 71:44)
a puzzle though (71:43 - 71:45)
remember when you got shout out to (71:44 - 71:47)
cannons in skyler's gym you had a point (71:45 - 71:49)
you had to go to the campus (71:47 - 71:52)
yes yeah cause you had to like (71:49 - 71:55)
get the right ones (71:52 - 71:55)
that was funny what is that black and (71:56 - 72:01)
white one (71:59 - 72:03)
because in black and white too skyla's (72:01 - 72:05)
gym is you have to hide behind the (72:03 - 72:10)
walls when the wind blows yeah (72:05 - 72:10)
this yeah yeah yeah and then there's (72:21 - 72:25)
that you step on the ice and it cracks (72:23 - 72:27)
and then if you step on it again you (72:25 - 72:28)
fall (72:27 - 72:30)
i like the slighty ice puzzles better (72:28 - 72:32)
than the cracky ice puzzles (72:30 - 72:34)
i like both i mean they're both better (72:32 - 72:35)
than rock puzzles (72:34 - 72:39)
oh 100 that's not a high bar uh yeah i (72:35 - 72:40)
like the sliding puzzles (72:39 - 72:41)
a lot i think i like the sliding puzzles (72:40 - 72:44)
more but i like the the steppy puzzles (72:41 - 72:48)
i wish the quiz (72:44 - 72:51)
puzzles were more interesting because it (72:48 - 72:52)
was blaine (72:51 - 72:55)
and clement both had neither one of them (72:52 - 72:56)
were all that interesting i was actually (72:55 - 72:57)
going to say (72:56 - 73:01)
that clements was my favorite puzzle (72:57 - 73:05)
because in order to (73:01 - 73:09)
register every pokemon in pokemon xy as (73:05 - 73:12)
seen with only one game you actually had (73:09 - 73:12)
to get (73:12 - 73:16)
clemont's puzzle wrong oh (73:12 - 73:20)
to be able to see the other pokemon (73:16 - 73:23)
otherwise you would come out with an (73:20 - 73:26)
incomplete scene pokedex what other (73:23 - 73:27)
puzzles are there i mean (73:26 - 73:30)
my least favorite puzzle (73:27 - 73:34)
i would have to say is uh the (73:30 - 73:36)
the rayquaza tower i've said it before (73:34 - 73:37)
just like the (73:36 - 73:41)
having to go use your bike to get over (73:37 - 73:42)
the cracked floor (73:41 - 73:44)
fast enough and like make the turns and (73:42 - 73:45)
everything (73:44 - 73:48)
is that a puzzle or is that like a skill (73:45 - 73:49)
challenge well (73:48 - 73:50)
because it was pretty basic yeah (73:49 - 73:52)
straight forward i mean also like the (73:50 - 73:54)
ultra worm holes right do you count them (73:52 - 73:56)
as a puzzle because i also find those to (73:54 - 73:58)
be quite terrible (73:56 - 74:00)
whatever wolf wolf is that's a puzzle i (73:58 - 74:01)
don't know what that's called (74:00 - 74:04)
the spinny ice gym the mechanics where (74:01 - 74:05)
you step out yeah (74:04 - 74:07)
you spin it line it up i guess that (74:05 - 74:08)
would be similar to like (74:07 - 74:12)
claire's also rotate like (74:08 - 74:13)
in hard cold soul silver you have to (74:12 - 74:15)
like rotate those platforms and then (74:13 - 74:17)
push them over the line oh yeah yeah (74:15 - 74:17)
yeah (74:17 - 74:19)
it's like very similar to wolf rick's (74:17 - 74:20)
just there's just nothing to do with (74:19 - 74:23)
complexity in pokemon game puzzles (74:20 - 74:24)
because it is an all ages game (74:23 - 74:26)
so it's like you don't want to have your (74:24 - 74:28)
kid handing the yes (74:26 - 74:31)
over and saying hey could you could you (74:28 - 74:34)
solve this for me it's duke confusing (74:31 - 74:36)
didn't fantina's gym have two puzzles (74:34 - 74:38)
between the two games (74:36 - 74:40)
yeah but i don't remember them different (74:38 - 74:41)
because when was he had to go through (74:40 - 74:43)
the doors in the dark (74:41 - 74:45)
oh you know what puzzles the worst (74:43 - 74:46)
sabrina slash (74:45 - 74:50)
valerie's puzzle the teleporting (74:46 - 74:52)
ones are just dumb they're just (74:50 - 74:54)
frustrating (74:52 - 74:56)
there's not like a strategy to them (74:54 - 74:58)
there's just you remember which ones (74:56 - 74:59)
take you where (74:58 - 75:00)
yeah and then you're good right there's (74:59 - 75:02)
not like uh no (75:00 - 75:04)
i think it's i mean this is like the (75:02 - 75:06)
team rocket gym based puzzle too (75:04 - 75:08)
the teleporters take you and then you (75:06 - 75:10)
use the elevator for certain things well (75:08 - 75:11)
team flare was the same thing (75:10 - 75:14)
yeah they're just not that interesting i (75:11 - 75:15)
find them very interesting i still find (75:14 - 75:17)
them better than rock puzzles (75:15 - 75:20)
the mystery house was always fun because (75:17 - 75:22)
you had to keep coming back (75:20 - 75:24)
yeah the trap house the mystery tap (75:22 - 75:25)
house yeah yeah (75:24 - 75:28)
i like the trap house (75:25 - 75:28)
omega ruby alpha sapphire rubies (75:28 - 75:33)
it was in ruby yeah ruby sapphire and (75:32 - 75:35)
emerald yeah it's (75:33 - 75:38)
just outside of slateport you go north (75:35 - 75:39)
and there's the guy that's like welcome (75:38 - 75:40)
to (75:39 - 75:42)
yeah well you go in and you don't see (75:40 - 75:44)
anybody and he's like i'm hiding can you (75:42 - 75:45)
find me (75:44 - 75:47)
and then you kind of just click around (75:45 - 75:48)
and then you eventually find him and (75:47 - 75:49)
he's like (75:48 - 75:52)
tomorrow and then he's like come into my (75:49 - 75:53)
trap (75:52 - 75:54)
come into my trap house and you walk in (75:53 - 75:55)
the back and then you have to go through (75:54 - 75:56)
the (75:55 - 75:58)
the ever-changing rooms cocos was pretty (75:56 - 76:00)
okay (75:58 - 76:02)
the like invisible walls that was pretty (76:00 - 76:03)
all right (76:02 - 76:07)
yeah i can't believe they've only done (76:03 - 76:08)
skyler's thing once (76:07 - 76:11)
like the the the air pushing you back (76:08 - 76:13)
like that that is actually a pretty cool (76:11 - 76:15)
puzzle (76:13 - 76:16)
yeah but there's not been another really (76:15 - 76:18)
good flying gym (76:16 - 76:19)
you know just copying like look we (76:18 - 76:21)
literally copy and paste in sabrina's to (76:19 - 76:22)
valerie's it is (76:21 - 76:24)
the only thing different is there's a (76:22 - 76:26)
reason for that though (76:24 - 76:29)
so there was yeah yeah you're in a house (76:26 - 76:30)
you had to teleport around the house (76:29 - 76:32)
because they're fairy tapes well (76:30 - 76:35)
but also if you notice the x and y had a (76:32 - 76:36)
lot of (76:35 - 76:40)
like copy and paste yeah yeah yeah (76:36 - 76:42)
i mean i thought there was like a lore (76:40 - 76:43)
reason not an original (76:42 - 76:45)
forest that you go through i think the (76:43 - 76:47)
layout was exactly the same (76:45 - 76:50)
it uh what what (76:47 - 76:52)
olympia's gym is that do we consider (76:50 - 76:53)
that a puzzle that's really no it's (76:52 - 76:56)
walking at a path yeah (76:53 - 76:56)
oh wait catching the fur fro in the in (76:59 - 77:03)
the gardens (77:02 - 77:05)
oh yeah oh that's like the like the (77:03 - 77:06)
farfetch'd thing (77:05 - 77:10)
too yeah those are okay (77:06 - 77:13)
there's they're way too they're way too (77:10 - 77:14)
short and simple to be (77:13 - 77:17)
like that engaging you like you look at (77:14 - 77:18)
that that's (77:17 - 77:21)
pokemon puzzles really apparently (77:18 - 77:24)
we all know the best pokemon puzzles (77:21 - 77:26)
were (77:24 - 77:31)
shuffle no pokemon shuffle (77:26 - 77:32)
yeah you gotta wait till saturday (77:31 - 77:34)
morning so you can do the meowth one (77:32 - 77:38)
yeah get all the coins yeah oh man (77:34 - 77:41)

literally what got me into the practice (77:41 - 77:45)
of like when i first wake up in the (77:43 - 77:46)
morning playing (77:45 - 77:49)
a video game for like 15 minutes before (77:46 - 77:52)

get through for it huh (78:04 - 78:08)
damn probably have like one more trailer (78:05 - 78:09)
for it (78:08 - 78:12)
all right where's my last week's pokemon (78:09 - 78:13)
last week's pokemon (78:12 - 78:15)
was one that some people could guess but (78:13 - 78:17)
obviously (78:15 - 78:19)
not greg because he tried to cheat and (78:17 - 78:20)
ask me (78:19 - 78:22)
who was the pokemon look i couldn't i (78:20 - 78:27)
couldn't find my sheet i found it (78:22 - 78:29)
there was a lot of uh fluff in here (78:27 - 78:31)
because i was (78:29 - 78:35)
very distracted last week and (78:31 - 78:38)
uh the pokemon is not featured in (78:35 - 78:40)
pokemon generations (78:38 - 78:44)
um it looks basically (78:40 - 78:46)
like if you stare at the actual pokemon (78:44 - 78:47)
it looks like (78:46 - 78:49)
the ends of its upper arms look like (78:47 - 78:51)
fangs and then its knees kind of look (78:49 - 78:52)
like teeth (78:51 - 78:54)
and then it's kind of middle section (78:52 - 78:56)
looks like a open (78:54 - 78:59)
mouth tongue thing uh (78:56 - 79:00)
so it looks like it could be a (78:59 - 79:02)
pre-evolution to guzzlord (79:00 - 79:06)
um you can only find it in nature on (79:02 - 79:07)
victory road in sinnoh (79:06 - 79:10)
in a dragon friend safari if you count (79:07 - 79:12)
that as finding it in nature (79:10 - 79:14)
and in the haina desert through an sos (79:12 - 79:16)
battle (79:14 - 79:22)
and you can't find it in pokemon masters (79:16 - 79:23)
all right who is it (79:22 - 79:25)
[Music] (79:23 - 79:28)
hip hop no (79:25 - 79:31)
it's gabayt gabite (79:28 - 79:34)
yes correct that is correct yes it's (79:31 - 79:36)
funny that it looks like an open mouth (79:34 - 79:39)
kind of like if you i like pretty much (79:36 - 79:42)
all of that lines designs yes (79:39 - 79:44)
i think all the designs of the whole (79:42 - 79:46)
gibbel line are really cute (79:44 - 79:49)
well that also that it's like nibble (79:46 - 79:49)
bite (79:49 - 79:52)
chomp yup it's always fun when they do (79:49 - 79:54)
those kinds of things (79:52 - 79:57)
uh i mean gabae and garchomp both look (79:54 - 79:58)
like (79:57 - 80:00)
airplanes i mean and it doesn't really (79:58 - 80:02)
set off my shark fear (80:00 - 80:05)
so interesting interesting um (80:02 - 80:07)
but it's funny that they look like (80:05 - 80:09)
airplanes even though they're not (80:07 - 80:12)
flying in any way or shape or form (80:09 - 80:14)
one of the pokemon that looks like it (80:12 - 80:16)
could be a monster hunter monster (80:14 - 80:21)
true true uh shuffle icon good (80:16 - 80:21)
uh gabbite shares the same category with (80:22 - 80:25)
drudging (80:24 - 80:29)
they're both known as cave pokemon (80:25 - 80:29)
gabites scales were stated to (80:29 - 80:35)
