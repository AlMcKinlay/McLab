one F tune in to find out which app (0:32 - 0:41)

I&#39;m in a in I&#39;m in a garage but uh but (0:44 - 0:50)
I&#39;m here part of the the terms of (0:47 - 0:52)
service for Hannah and Bobby is one of (0:50 - 0:53)
them has to be in a different location (0:52 - 0:56)
at all times when we&#39;re recording this (0:53 - 0:58)
episode any (0:56 - 1:01)
episode those are the rules (0:58 - 1:04)
uh we have uh kind of like three topics (1:01 - 1:09)
this week uh and I&#39;m I&#39;m traveling so (1:04 - 1:11)
fun if you&#39;re listening this on Monday (1:09 - 1:15)
morning I should be on the TW twitch.tv (1:11 - 1:17)
pookemon the official Pokemon Channel I (1:15 - 1:19)
wasn&#39;t able to announce this until (1:17 - 1:22)
Friday and I think the Pokemon company (1:19 - 1:24)
tweeted it today on Saturday the day (1:22 - 1:25)
we&#39;re recording this uh they&#39;re flying (1:24 - 1:29)
me out to their offices uh CU they want (1:25 - 1:32)
me to show the holiday merch that&#39;s what (1:29 - 1:35)
they told me um so that&#39;s cool that&#39;s (1:32 - 1:38)
exciting that was all very last minute (1:35 - 1:39)
if you&#39;ve listened to this podcast for (1:38 - 1:42)
more than 10 episodes you have slowly (1:39 - 1:44)
maybe realized that the Pokemon company (1:42 - 1:47)
loves to do everything last (1:44 - 1:47)
minute I I don&#39;t I think that&#39;s like (1:47 - 1:53)
most big companies though where like (1:50 - 1:57)
things just get stuck you waiting for (1:53 - 2:02)
everything but yeah that happens yeah (1:57 - 2:02)
um so I don&#39;t know maybe me slamming (2:02 - 2:08)
merchandise for Instagram reels and then (2:05 - 2:11)
opening them was like we need this guy (2:08 - 2:14)
to come out here to open some (2:11 - 2:16)
merchandise um it&#39;s really flattering (2:14 - 2:18)
it&#39;s super it&#39;s always weird to be like (2:16 - 2:21)
tweeted out by the Pokemon company or to (2:18 - 2:23)
be on they told me that this is like the (2:21 - 2:25)
first ever live stream they&#39;re doing (2:23 - 2:27)
from their (2:25 - 2:30)
offices um wow so that&#39;s cool I&#39;m sure (2:27 - 2:33)
my LinkedIn profile will love that (2:30 - 2:36)
information just (2:33 - 2:39)
soaring so uh I&#39;ll report back from that (2:36 - 2:42)
so uh anyways our three topics for the (2:39 - 2:44)
show are we&#39;re going to revisit (2:42 - 2:46)
gigantamax since Bobby is here and also (2:44 - 2:49)
Gengar just happened um find out in five (2:46 - 2:51)
minutes whether Hannah or not did a (2:49 - 2:53)
Gengar (2:51 - 2:57)
uh and then uh there&#39;s a brand new TCG (2:53 - 3:00)
set which Bobby has more details than I (2:57 - 3:02)
do on that and probably a lot of (3:00 - 3:05)
thoughts on that uh and then a brand new (3:02 - 3:07)
mobile app just came out which is TCG (3:05 - 3:10)
pocket which I played in New York a (3:07 - 3:11)
couple months ago and now it&#39;s out here (3:10 - 3:15)
for everyone and uh we&#39;re g to spend the (3:11 - 3:16)
majority of the episode talking about (3:15 - 3:21)
that so that&#39;s that&#39;s exciting um so (3:16 - 3:24)
gigantamax uh we had a very mixed (3:21 - 3:28)
episode last week with uh (3:24 - 3:32)
comments and reactions (3:28 - 3:34)
Hannah did not get to do any Al (3:32 - 3:36)
surprisingly very positive I didn&#39;t (3:34 - 3:39)
think Al would be so positive but uh you (3:36 - 3:42)
know he went out he he got it done uh I (3:39 - 3:44)
loved it I got called to shill for that (3:42 - 3:46)
that&#39;s cool that&#39;s fine (3:44 - 3:49)
I I bring up Destiny raids and Final (3:46 - 3:51)
Fantasy raids and sword and shield (3:49 - 3:52)
scarlet and violet raids consistently I (3:51 - 3:55)
like love raid content it&#39;s just like (3:52 - 3:59)
something I like so I&#39;m like I&#39;m not (3:55 - 4:03)
surprised I like The Raid content um (3:59 - 4:06)
Bobby did you get any gigantamax raids (4:03 - 4:12)
done I did not no uh I I was last couple (4:06 - 4:13)
weeks have been pretty busy uh so I did (4:12 - 4:15)
not have a chance to get out there I (4:13 - 4:18)
will say I agree with Hannah&#39;s point (4:15 - 4:21)
last week about it just being there for (4:18 - 4:24)
a day was a little bit of a bummer for (4:21 - 4:26)
the three for the first three for Venus (4:24 - 4:28)
or Charizard Blastoise oh the week it (4:26 - 4:30)
was two days two days sorry for the (4:28 - 4:32)
weekend weend for the one weekend I (4:30 - 4:33)
think it would have been cool if they (4:32 - 4:37)
would have done it like a second weekend (4:33 - 4:39)
or maybe like if maybe they will like (4:37 - 4:40)
maybe next month there&#39;s like a weekend (4:39 - 4:42)
that they do it again where it&#39;s like (4:40 - 4:44)
pretty close um where you could do it (4:42 - 4:47)
you know have another shot at it but uh (4:44 - 4:49)
no I didn&#39;t have a chance to do those uh (4:47 - 4:52)
I did read a lot about it like I was (4:49 - 4:53)
because I was like I was really (4:52 - 4:55)
interested in how these things were (4:53 - 4:56)
going to work and how it was going to be (4:55 - 5:01)
different from the Dynamax raids which (4:56 - 5:03)
obviously we now know how different it (5:01 - 5:06)
is from the Dynamax raid but uh so I was (5:03 - 5:09)
very interested in it in that way but (5:06 - 5:11)
between just being busy (5:09 - 5:15)
and not really wanting to go find a (5:11 - 5:18)
group of 20 or more to do it with last (5:15 - 5:20)
weekend I did not get anything (5:18 - 5:23)
done did you (5:20 - 5:26)
feel the fomo that I believe Hannah (5:23 - 5:31)
really stressed that she felt (5:26 - 5:31)
no actually like so the thing about (5:31 - 5:40)
Dynamax and gigantamax Pokemon for me (5:35 - 5:43)
is uh one of the things that I love (5:40 - 5:45)
doing in Pokemon go aside from catching (5:43 - 5:48)
Pokemon um is the taking the pictures of (5:45 - 5:51)
Pokemon and for the at the moment you (5:48 - 5:53)
can&#39;t take a picture like you can&#39;t take (5:51 - 5:55)
a picture of a gig a gigantamax (5:53 - 5:58)
Charizard or a Dynamax Pokemon you know (5:55 - 6:00)
that only happens in battle right so for (5:58 - 6:03)
that it kind of allows me or at least (6:00 - 6:05)
I&#39;m telling myself this to not feel like (6:03 - 6:09)
I want to go do them at the moment uh so (6:05 - 6:12)
that&#39;s been okay but the more that I was (6:09 - 6:15)
hearing about it over this last week (6:12 - 6:16)
like the more I was hearing you guys (6:15 - 6:17)
talk about it the more I was hearing I (6:16 - 6:20)
was watching a couple um YouTube videos (6:17 - 6:23)
about it I was more intrigued just (6:20 - 6:25)
because it&#39;s nice to have a different (6:23 - 6:28)
way to battle that isn&#39;t just mashing (6:25 - 6:31)
the attack button over and over and not (6:28 - 6:32)
including PVP but like a different we&#39;ve (6:31 - 6:34)
done it for seven years we can keep on (6:32 - 6:36)
mashing for another seven years and (6:34 - 6:38)
that&#39;s fine we have the regular raids (6:36 - 6:40)
for all the mashing attack we want but (6:38 - 6:43)
like it&#39;s nice to have a way like a a (6:40 - 6:46)
different strategy and it kind (6:43 - 6:50)
of uh like gives me reason (6:46 - 6:52)
to actually (6:50 - 6:55)
invest resources into things like to I (6:52 - 6:57)
think it was Steve pointed this out like (6:55 - 6:59)
I don&#39;t spend my Stardust on anything (6:57 - 7:00)
because I don&#39;t PVP (6:59 - 7:02)
and I&#39;ve got raids I&#39;ve got raid Pokemon (7:00 - 7:05)
that have been set up for years now that (7:02 - 7:08)
just work to do regular raids and (7:05 - 7:11)
legendary raids so it is nice to have (7:08 - 7:14)
something else to build up or something (7:11 - 7:16)
else to work toward um I think that is (7:14 - 7:18)
pretty cool have you been investing in (7:16 - 7:22)
the Dynamax at all so far I I was (7:18 - 7:24)
because I wasn&#39;t doing a whole lot of (7:22 - 7:26)
Dynamax raids to begin with I did a few (7:24 - 7:29)
and got some good Dynamax Pokemon and (7:26 - 7:30)
then I was investing in those Pokemon (7:29 - 7:34)
with like the particles and as far as (7:30 - 7:35)
like candy I know a lot of people are (7:34 - 7:37)
like the candy and everything but all (7:35 - 7:38)
the ones that I&#39;ve invested in are the (7:37 - 7:40)
Pokemon who had like Community Days (7:38 - 7:43)
right so like the Charmander Bulbasaur (7:40 - 7:46)
the Beldum you know those uh so it&#39;s (7:43 - 7:48)
been fun to just like invest in that (7:46 - 7:53)
stuff um so yeah I like it I mean I (7:48 - 7:55)
think it&#39;s cool I think that the only (7:53 - 7:57)
issue which I know was echoed multiple (7:55 - 8:00)
times last week is that no one was (7:57 - 8:02)
prepared for how to do these raids (8:00 - 8:04)
because they never prepped anyone for (8:02 - 8:06)
how to use the other moves that they (8:04 - 8:08)
gave us yeah there was no you know there (8:06 - 8:11)
was no in between where we were like (8:08 - 8:13)
let&#39;s have a Dynamax Pokemon that you (8:11 - 8:15)
have to use max guard or Max Spirit (8:13 - 8:16)
against and have a few more people than (8:15 - 8:19)
just like soloing it you know I mean (8:16 - 8:22)
failinks nobody was doing a failinks (8:19 - 8:23)
with like five or six people for the (8:22 - 8:24)
most part people were figuring out how (8:23 - 8:26)
to solo failings or maybe do it with (8:24 - 8:30)
like one other but yeah it was easy to (8:26 - 8:32)
failing yeah you didn&#39;t need to Max (8:30 - 8:34)
guard or Max spirit for that so it would (8:32 - 8:37)
have been nice if they would have maybe (8:34 - 8:41)
just told people that like maybe tell (8:37 - 8:43)
told people to like hey maybe look at (8:41 - 8:45)
actually using or powering up those (8:43 - 8:46)
other (8:45 - 8:48)
moves well they can tell you as much as (8:46 - 8:50)
they want they can tell you how many (8:48 - 8:52)
people they&#39;re going to need to do this (8:50 - 8:55)
raid and I really think people just (8:52 - 8:57)
needed to (8:55 - 9:01)
experience the potential failure well (8:57 - 9:04)
I I 100% agree I I&#39;m not against that (9:01 - 9:07)
but then but then for these three (9:04 - 9:09)
starters again give it another weekend (9:07 - 9:12)
like give another shot at some time (9:09 - 9:14)
that&#39;s in a closer proximity to when (9:12 - 9:17)
you&#39;re first doing it because it is and (9:14 - 9:19)
I guess I I feel like I&#39;m just echoing (9:17 - 9:20)
some of the points you guys said last (9:19 - 9:22)
week but no it&#39;s okay I your opinion is (9:20 - 9:26)
valid it is um disheartening to like go (9:22 - 9:30)
out to do the work of going out finding (9:26 - 9:32)
a group especially if you&#39;re not in a (9:30 - 9:33)
place where that&#39;s easy to do I mean (9:32 - 9:35)
again Steve you know you live in a big (9:33 - 9:38)
city I live in a big city it&#39;s not hard (9:35 - 9:40)
like it wouldn&#39;t be hard for me to go (9:38 - 9:41)
find a I live in the eighth biggest city (9:40 - 9:43)
in the country like it wouldn&#39;t be hard (9:41 - 9:45)
for me to go find a group if I really (9:43 - 9:47)
wanted to but there are so many places (9:45 - 9:50)
where it takes work to like know okay (9:47 - 9:52)
I&#39;m gonna go find a group I&#39;m gonna go (9:50 - 9:54)
meet up with them for the for whatever (9:52 - 9:56)
for everything it takes to do these (9:54 - 9:57)
raids as well it&#39;s like we&#39;re going to (9:56 - 10:01)
go through all of that and then to f (9:57 - 10:05)
and not have the time to like or the (10:01 - 10:07)
potential resources in that moment to (10:05 - 10:10)
get everything switched up to do it (10:07 - 10:14)
correctly is a bummer and so it&#39;s like (10:10 - 10:15)
if they would have been like okay here&#39;s (10:14 - 10:17)
the first weekend people would have done (10:15 - 10:19)
it failed they oh man that&#39;s such a (10:17 - 10:20)
bummer and then here&#39;s the second (10:19 - 10:21)
weekend and you know you have that (10:20 - 10:24)
second chance to go and get those three (10:21 - 10:26)
starters I mean to your point like (10:24 - 10:28)
they&#39;re going to come back right it&#39;s (10:26 - 10:29)
the Kanto starters they&#39;re going to come (10:28 - 10:31)
back back 50 times and we&#39;re all going (10:29 - 10:35)
to be sick of it in like a year but you (10:31 - 10:37)
know it&#39;s a bad first impression right (10:35 - 10:38)
you don&#39;t want to have that bad first (10:37 - 10:41)
impression of gigantamax raids and then (10:38 - 10:42)
have people just like well I&#39;m not going (10:41 - 10:44)
to go do Gengar these were terrible I (10:42 - 10:46)
had a terrible experience I&#39;m not going (10:44 - 10:48)
to go do any more of this of this (10:46 - 10:50)
feature uh you don&#39;t want to have that (10:48 - 10:53)
and that is what it feels like a lot of (10:50 - 10:56)
people came away with this last weekend (10:53 - 10:58)
to me and I think that&#39;s why they made (10:56 - 11:01)
Gengar and so far only gangar quote (10:58 - 11:04)
unquote easier right slightly easier n (11:01 - 11:07)
stressed to me and other creators to say (11:04 - 11:10)
slightly easier yeah I have quote and (11:07 - 11:14)
make sure you we when we say slightly we (11:10 - 11:17)
mean (11:14 - 11:19)
slightly yeah I mean I do think there (11:17 - 11:22)
were groups of four taking it down right (11:19 - 11:25)
yes uh but Blastoise was completed with (11:22 - 11:28)
a group of eight last last weekend okay (11:25 - 11:32)
yeah but I think the other thing that (11:28 - 11:34)
was a bit odd (11:32 - 11:37)
is not maybe odd just maybe not the (11:34 - 11:40)
right move don&#39;t introduce three at once (11:37 - 11:43)
like introduce one Pokemon for people to (11:40 - 11:46)
focus on you know like not all three (11:43 - 11:48)
because there&#39;s so much to have to use (11:46 - 11:50)
so many resources you have to use to get (11:48 - 11:52)
and I know that once you got the (11:50 - 11:53)
Charizard then you could use the (11:52 - 11:55)
Charizard against the Venusaur and then (11:53 - 11:57)
the Venusaur against the Blastoise and I (11:55 - 11:58)
understand that but going into it (11:57 - 12:01)
initially like if I&#39;m going to prep my (11:58 - 12:03)
teams for what&#39;s going to potentially (12:01 - 12:05)
happen just if you&#39;re introducing the (12:03 - 12:08)
mechanic just just give us one Pokemon (12:05 - 12:10)
at a time to start like this is the (12:08 - 12:11)
company that has still hasn&#39;t given us (12:10 - 12:14)
mimikyu like how many years later and (12:11 - 12:16)
they want to give us three gigantamax (12:14 - 12:20)
Pokemon right off the bat like it&#39;s just (12:16 - 12:20)
surprising yeah I (12:21 - 12:26)
I I think there were a lot of people (12:24 - 12:30)
emotionally charged last week of well (12:26 - 12:32)
multiple reasons right there there is (12:30 - 12:34)
the I will never have 40 people or I (12:32 - 12:37)
will never have 20 people or I I can&#39;t (12:34 - 12:38)
even get 10 people and those are that&#39;s (12:37 - 12:42)
like a completely valid complaint I (12:38 - 12:45)
think where I was trying to speak from (12:42 - 12:47)
last week was from a gameplay (12:45 - 12:50)
perspective I think that if you have the (12:47 - 12:51)
people (12:50 - 12:56)
there the actual raid is really cool mhm (12:51 - 12:58)
in a perfect world if you can get 40 (12:56 - 13:00)
people together and those 40 people are (12:58 - 13:02)
broken up into 10 groups of four and in (13:00 - 13:05)
that 10 in that group of four you have a (13:02 - 13:07)
Healer you have a tank you have two DPS (13:05 - 13:08)
it is (13:07 - 13:11)
so much more interesting than just (13:08 - 13:14)
tapping your screen yeah it it is like (13:11 - 13:17)
this endgame content it&#39;s new content (13:14 - 13:19)
it&#39;s also content that is completely (13:17 - 13:22)
ignorable if if if you don&#39;t care about (13:19 - 13:24)
gigantamax um if you were like I already (13:22 - 13:26)
got a shiny charizard I already got a (13:24 - 13:27)
Shiny Gengar I don&#39;t care if this one (13:26 - 13:31)
can get bigger it is in its own pocket (13:27 - 13:32)
of the game that you can completely (13:31 - 13:35)
ignore um and maybe there will be like a (13:32 - 13:37)
mythical Quest down the line like I (13:35 - 13:39)
think what is it like Shaman is like get (13:37 - 13:41)
like 10 best buddies or something and (13:39 - 13:42)
people have ignored the best buddy (13:41 - 13:46)
system like that could for a long (13:42 - 13:48)
time I I&#39;m sure there&#39;s tons of players (13:46 - 13:51)
that ignore the best buddy system I like (13:48 - 13:53)
it I think it&#39;s like I don&#39;t know I (13:51 - 13:57)
enjoy it um yeah but that&#39;s that&#39;s where (13:53 - 13:59)
I was like really coming from I also (13:57 - 14:01)
think that (13:59 - 14:04)
like this is not unique to like there (14:01 - 14:06)
are some things unique to Pokémon go (14:04 - 14:10)
like getting 40 people in person that is (14:06 - 14:13)
unique to that game right yeah um but I (14:10 - 14:14)
don&#39;t think (14:13 - 14:18)
the The Raid culture is honestly that (14:14 - 14:23)
unique right like (14:18 - 14:23)
um understanding roles and understanding (14:24 - 14:29)
that there might be failure and then (14:27 - 14:32)
adjusting to that failure exists in a (14:29 - 14:34)
lot of games that have raids if you were (14:32 - 14:37)
to play Final Fantasy 14 or World of (14:34 - 14:40)
Warcraft people are not clearing bosses (14:37 - 14:42)
on their first try they are failing (14:40 - 14:45)
bosses 20 30 times in a row and they are (14:42 - 14:48)
adjusting and they&#39;re and I can I can (14:45 - 14:50)
say this as somebody who has 3,000 hours (14:48 - 14:53)
in Final Fantasy 14 it like the only way (14:50 - 14:54)
you&#39;re clearing them the first time is (14:53 - 14:56)
if everyone exactly knows what they&#39;re (14:54 - 14:58)
doing but all it takes is one or two (14:56 - 15:01)
people in a in a raid of like eight to (14:58 - 15:03)
not stand in the right position and then (15:01 - 15:05)
all of a sudden that whole raid fails (15:03 - 15:06)
and everyone&#39;s like okay no big deal we (15:05 - 15:09)
can just do it again and I don&#39;t think (15:06 - 15:12)
Pokemon players have enough of that (15:09 - 15:15)
experience because raids are relatively (15:12 - 15:18)
new in both main series Pokemon games (15:15 - 15:21)
right and I would argue this in Pokemon (15:18 - 15:24)
go because the current raid system was (15:21 - 15:28)
just tap tap tap but I will say there (15:24 - 15:30)
was a point in time and I think Pokémon (15:28 - 15:34)
go players maybe forgot this where we (15:30 - 15:37)
were struggling to get 8 to 12 people to (15:34 - 15:40)
do a Tyranitar raid (15:37 - 15:43)
yes and now and and and because the game (15:40 - 15:45)
is so old we don&#39;t even think about that (15:43 - 15:47)
anymore it&#39;s like oh a three or four (15:45 - 15:49)
star raid here I&#39;ll just bring in my (15:47 - 15:51)
Kyogre I&#39;ll just bring in my Groudon (15:49 - 15:53)
I&#39;ll just bring in my shadow Mewtwo raid (15:51 - 15:55)
is done but there was a point in time (15:53 - 15:58)
where raids were difficult and we worked (15:55 - 16:01)
our way up and we got through it and in (15:58 - 16:02)
this (16:01 - 16:06)
case really the Charizard again ignoring (16:02 - 16:09)
that you need you know 20 to 40 people (16:06 - 16:11)
there was that it kind of did remind me (16:09 - 16:14)
of like that Tyranitar situation of like (16:11 - 16:16)
I don&#39;t know I we get like we&#39;re going (16:14 - 16:17)
to have enough people to do this (16:16 - 16:18)
Tyranitar everyone really wants (16:17 - 16:20)
Tyranitar because Tyranitar is really (16:18 - 16:22)
good for raids like these gigantamax (16:20 - 16:26)
Pokemon are really good for other G xres (16:22 - 16:28)
so well yes there&#39;s two things I&#39;ll will (16:26 - 16:32)
say to that one is I agree like I&#39;m look (16:28 - 16:34)
thinking back seven years when we had (16:32 - 16:38)
Articuno and Lugia spawn and I was not (16:34 - 16:41)
beating Articuno and Lugia every time (16:38 - 16:42)
that I was going out and raiding because (16:41 - 16:44)
that was not we were not we did not get (16:42 - 16:46)
enough people to raid them or we were (16:44 - 16:48)
figuring out what minimum we needed and (16:46 - 16:49)
how we needed to power up our Pokemon to (16:48 - 16:52)
do it and all of that and that&#39;s that&#39;s (16:49 - 16:54)
totally true and it was the same it&#39;s (16:52 - 16:55)
kind of the same as what we&#39;re seeing (16:54 - 16:58)
now there&#39;s two differences one is that (16:55 - 17:01)
was all happening when this game like (16:58 - 17:05)
pre-2020 the game has changed and it&#39;s (17:01 - 17:07)
changed people&#39;s like way they play the (17:05 - 17:10)
game since the introduction of remote (17:07 - 17:12)
raids and just playing the game (17:10 - 17:13)
differently like I understand that (17:12 - 17:16)
Niantic their goal is to get people out (17:13 - 17:18)
and get them into a community and (17:16 - 17:19)
playing the game together and I don&#39;t (17:18 - 17:21)
have any problem with the fact that (17:19 - 17:24)
that&#39;s what they want to do but I think (17:21 - 17:27)
that people were so used to and I know (17:24 - 17:29)
there were people that complained about (17:27 - 17:31)
like the the legendary raids being too (17:29 - 17:33)
hard at that time too but we were all (17:31 - 17:38)
used to going to do raids at a place (17:33 - 17:40)
together like you know you you knew you (17:38 - 17:42)
were going to have to go to a place and (17:40 - 17:46)
do raids and there wasn&#39;t ever an option (17:42 - 17:47)
obviously of doing them remotely or (17:46 - 17:49)
anything like that and I think once they (17:47 - 17:52)
introduced remote raids it changed a lot (17:49 - 17:54)
of perspectives on like going and doing (17:52 - 17:57)
things or and people not going out to go (17:54 - 17:59)
and be a social for a lot of other (17:57 - 18:02)
reasons as well um for a period of time (17:59 - 18:05)
and that&#39;s not fully like I I don&#39;t (18:02 - 18:06)
think we&#39;re ever going to get to a point (18:05 - 18:09)
where the game is like it was before all (18:06 - 18:12)
of that so I like and I&#39;m not saying (18:09 - 18:14)
that they need to make remote raids like (18:12 - 18:16)
remote gigantamax raids or anything I&#39;m (18:14 - 18:19)
just saying that I don&#39;t it&#39;s different (18:16 - 18:21)
like it&#39;s just it&#39;s different than it (18:19 - 18:23)
was so I can (18:21 - 18:25)
see even though it feels the same in the (18:23 - 18:27)
sense of like this is the thing that (18:25 - 18:28)
happened and now it&#39;s kind of happening (18:27 - 18:31)
again the the game the way the game is (18:28 - 18:33)
played is just different than it was at (18:31 - 18:36)
that point in time um so that&#39;s one (18:33 - 18:38)
thing and the second (18:36 - 18:41)
is even though these will potentially (18:38 - 18:44)
get easier over time for people because (18:41 - 18:46)
that&#39;s just the way that these things go (18:44 - 18:49)
it&#39;s still a first impression and you (18:46 - 18:51)
don&#39;t want that first impression to feel (18:49 - 18:53)
so negative and the difference between (18:51 - 18:56)
like doing raids in a game like World of (18:53 - 18:58)
Warcraft or Destiny or things like that (18:56 - 19:01)
is that you know you can do them 30 or (18:58 - 19:02)
40 times you can redo them you can do (19:01 - 19:04)
things like that in this I think what a (19:02 - 19:07)
lot of people may have had a problem (19:04 - 19:08)
with or what I could from what I could (19:07 - 19:11)
see is that they were told okay you&#39;re (19:08 - 19:13)
GNA go and you can do these raids today (19:11 - 19:15)
and or Saturday and (19:13 - 19:19)
Sunday and bring your Pokemon and power (19:15 - 19:22)
things up but they didn&#39;t nobody knew (19:19 - 19:24)
how what to like nobody knew that there (19:22 - 19:27)
was a difference of what they should be (19:24 - 19:29)
doing like even like you were saying (19:27 - 19:30)
like people have to fail experience the (19:29 - 19:33)
failure to like fully get it but MH they (19:30 - 19:36)
didn&#39;t try to explain to people that hey (19:33 - 19:38)
these Gigan X raids are going to be (19:36 - 19:39)
different than anything that you&#39;ve (19:38 - 19:41)
dealt with over the last seven years (19:39 - 19:44)
well to an extent they did the gigant (19:41 - 19:46)
max raids function similarly to the (19:44 - 19:48)
Dynamax raids and they did tell us that (19:46 - 19:50)
we would need a lot of people and they (19:48 - 19:53)
did tell us this was endgame content so (19:50 - 19:55)
I I I agree with I agree with you Bobby (19:53 - 19:57)
I totally agree that like they they (19:55 - 19:59)
didn&#39;t tell us what to do it how to do (19:57 - 20:02)
it I agree that this is a bad first (19:59 - 20:06)
impression but when a company says hey (20:02 - 20:08)
this is AME (20:06 - 20:10)
content and people are showing up with (20:08 - 20:13)
Sables and score bunnies and (20:10 - 20:16)
charmanders you could tell them what to (20:13 - 20:18)
you you told them this is endgame (20:16 - 20:20)
content and they couldn&#39;t even evolve (20:18 - 20:23)
their Gastly but okay but but beside (20:20 - 20:25)
that beside the the fact that like (20:23 - 20:26)
you&#39;re always going to have people who (20:25 - 20:28)
are bringing in Sables and gastes and (20:26 - 20:30)
and Anders that&#39;s not my point I&#39;m not (20:28 - 20:33)
I&#39;m not saying that like my point isn&#39;t (20:30 - 20:35)
like people are going to be people my (20:33 - 20:37)
point is that the company that makes the (20:35 - 20:39)
game and is making the experience for (20:37 - 20:41)
people should be doing everything in (20:39 - 20:43)
their power to make that a positive (20:41 - 20:45)
positive experience for people you have (20:43 - 20:47)
introduced a mechanic and then in the (20:45 - 20:49)
mechanic that you&#39;ve introduced you&#39;ve (20:47 - 20:51)
never made it so that people actually (20:49 - 20:53)
have to use the other moves or (20:51 - 20:55)
understand that there is a strategy (20:53 - 20:57)
aside from Mash attacking in those (20:55 - 20:59)
Dynamax raids and then you bring bring (20:57 - 21:01)
them out for one weekend to get the (20:59 - 21:04)
three Kanto starters which are obviously (21:01 - 21:06)
some of the most popular Pokemon that (21:04 - 21:10)
exists and are and then aren&#39;t telling (21:06 - 21:12)
anybody like oh you know those other two (21:10 - 21:13)
moves that we introduced but like you&#39;ve (21:12 - 21:16)
never had to touch before they&#39;re really (21:13 - 21:19)
actually really important and you need (21:16 - 21:20)
to actually I mean they&#39;re the two (21:19 - 21:22)
they&#39;re easily the two best moves ever (21:20 - 21:25)
right like Max and Max Spirit are so (21:22 - 21:27)
powerful but like and the point is but (21:25 - 21:29)
my point isn&#39;t that like yeah people are (21:27 - 21:30)
going to be people people are still (21:29 - 21:32)
going to not do the thing but as the (21:30 - 21:34)
company I feel like you should be trying (21:32 - 21:37)
to allow people to understand that in (21:34 - 21:39)
some way and there was no communication (21:37 - 21:42)
they should have released a fourstar or (21:39 - 21:45)
a five star raid where you might have (21:42 - 21:48)
felt compelled to teach Max guard like I (21:45 - 21:50)
think trainer tips had probably one of (21:48 - 21:53)
the best videos about it yeah uh and I (21:50 - 21:55)
can sum it up in like one sentence he (21:53 - 21:58)
said that Niantic gave us more than (21:55 - 22:01)
enough time to be ready they just didn&#39;t (21:58 - 22:06)
tell us how to be ready and a million (22:01 - 22:09)
agree with that I I still (22:06 - 22:11)
think um here I I know I always use (22:09 - 22:13)
Destiny and I always use Final Fantasy (22:11 - 22:15)
I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m going to compare this to (22:13 - 22:18)
Pokemon when Mewtwo came to scar sword (22:15 - 22:19)
and (22:18 - 22:23)
shield people joined that raid with like (22:19 - 22:26)
siny or their shiny groi or like (22:23 - 22:29)
whatever Pokemon because five star raids (22:26 - 22:32)
which was the max raid at the time in (22:29 - 22:35)
sword in Scarlet in sword and shield (22:32 - 22:38)
were the hardest content and the problem (22:35 - 22:40)
with raids it&#39;s not really a problem but (22:38 - 22:41)
how those raids were designed in sword (22:40 - 22:43)
and shield were it didn&#39;t matter if you (22:41 - 22:45)
use sword dance it didn&#39;t matter if you (22:43 - 22:46)
used acid spray because you were going (22:45 - 22:49)
to hit a damag threshold that damag (22:46 - 22:51)
threshold was going to trigger a shield (22:49 - 22:54)
you could literally use tackle against (22:51 - 22:56)
that Shield but you had to do it you had (22:54 - 22:58)
to just hit three moves anyways or five (22:56 - 23:00)
moves to break that Shield to then hit (22:58 - 23:03)
the second damage threshold MH and so (23:00 - 23:07)
because people were so accustom to just (23:03 - 23:09)
bringing their favorite Shiny Pokemon at (23:07 - 23:11)
level 100 they would they would lock (23:09 - 23:14)
into this Mewtwo raid with just their (23:11 - 23:17)
favorite shinies and they got absolutely (23:14 - 23:19)
destroyed and it wasn&#39;t until you know (23:17 - 23:23)
it it took I don&#39;t know what an hour (23:19 - 23:24)
before people figured out okay like (23:23 - 23:26)
marshadow is really good or like this (23:24 - 23:29)
Pokemon is really good or we need we (23:26 - 23:31)
need something else and then they they (23:29 - 23:34)
eventually did that and that happened in (23:31 - 23:37)
Pokémon go right like people are like ah (23:34 - 23:39)
you know when you&#39;re joining Al Lugia (23:37 - 23:41)
and there&#39;s 20 people joining Al Lugia (23:39 - 23:43)
it is literally like I&#39;m just going to (23:41 - 23:47)
Auto recommend okay chansy Stantler the (23:43 - 23:49)
the score Bunny raboot and people are (23:47 - 23:52)
are have seven years of just being like (23:49 - 23:54)
I just I just tapped the button and (23:52 - 23:57)
that&#39;s what happened here so (23:54 - 24:01)
like I I I I am agreeing with you 100% (23:57 - 24:02)
yeah but (24:01 - 24:04)
like and I am agreeing that Niantic (24:02 - 24:06)
should have done more and I&#39;m agreeing (24:04 - 24:07)
that probably should have been a four (24:06 - 24:11)
and five star raid but I am also saying (24:07 - 24:13)
that that that they&#39;re just even this (24:11 - 24:16)
weekend even with gar there are still (24:13 - 24:17)
people showing up with gastley there are (24:16 - 24:19)
still people showing up with score (24:17 - 24:21)
bunnies I don&#39;t like did they miss the (24:19 - 24:24)
message that this is endgame content (24:21 - 24:27)
that this is like you don&#39;t have like (24:24 - 24:29)
you don&#39;t have to be like Max you don&#39;t (24:27 - 24:30)
have to be level 50 you don&#39;t have to (24:29 - 24:33)
have level 50 Pokemon but maybe you (24:30 - 24:35)
should like evolve your Gastly I don&#39;t (24:33 - 24:38)
know like like they&#39;re still not making (24:35 - 24:40)
it super I feel like they&#39;re still not (24:38 - 24:42)
making it super clear that this is quote (24:40 - 24:44)
unquote endgame content and along with (24:42 - 24:47)
that a lot of people only come out to (24:44 - 24:50)
the bigger events to get the special (24:47 - 24:53)
Pokemon and so if you are only going out (24:50 - 24:54)
to the bigger events and you&#39;re not (24:53 - 24:56)
playing the game as much on the other (24:54 - 24:58)
days but you want to go and get this (24:56 - 25:01)
drag anom Max Pokémon and then you open (24:58 - 25:04)
up the game and there are literally no (25:01 - 25:08)
Dynamax Pokémon you can catch to build (25:04 - 25:10)
up a new team or get other Pokemon that (25:08 - 25:12)
are stronger than the ones you currently (25:10 - 25:14)
have you literally can&#39;t improve on your (25:12 - 25:17)
team unless you already have those (25:14 - 25:20)
Pokemon on that day you can&#39;t iterate (25:17 - 25:22)
and get better in the same day you have (25:20 - 25:24)
to be able to come back at the next (25:22 - 25:28)
event on the next weekend yeah which is (25:24 - 25:29)
kind of (25:28 - 25:31)
it feels like there&#39;s more at stake (25:29 - 25:33)
because you&#39;re actually like you (25:31 - 25:35)
actually have to go somewhere like you (25:33 - 25:37)
you have to leave your house and (25:35 - 25:39)
actually like plan out a portion of your (25:37 - 25:44)
day to go like somewhere whereas in like (25:39 - 25:47)
sword and shield or Scarlet Violet like (25:44 - 25:50)
you can do that at home like if they (25:47 - 25:52)
remote raid the gigantamax and you could (25:50 - 25:54)
like do it I just think there&#39;s more it (25:52 - 25:57)
feels all I&#39;m saying is all I&#39;m saying (25:54 - 25:59)
is I I do understand where people were (25:57 - 26:03)
coming from last week in their anger but (25:59 - 26:06)
I I actually I will say I do like the (26:03 - 26:08)
way that the Gigan Max raids work I (26:06 - 26:10)
think this is a great mechanic and it&#39;s (26:08 - 26:12)
GNA like down the line it&#39;s great to see (26:10 - 26:16)
a change in how all of this works I just (26:12 - 26:18)
think it was a very messy execution to (26:16 - 26:20)
start that&#39;s all you know and I just and (26:18 - 26:22)
I understand it was not messy because it (26:20 - 26:25)
was broken it was messy because well (26:22 - 26:29)
yeah yeah yeah true it actually went off (26:25 - 26:31)
yeah well other than a ton of people (26:29 - 26:34)
getting banned for potentially no reason (26:31 - 26:35)
I don&#39;t think we figured that out but (26:34 - 26:38)
that is true but I (26:35 - 26:41)
mean the the raids are as broken as like (26:38 - 26:43)
any other raids like sometimes Dodge (26:41 - 26:45)
doesn&#39;t fully work where sometimes it (26:43 - 26:48)
doesn&#39;t feel like you never Dodge oh I&#39;m (26:45 - 26:50)
I&#39;m I&#39;m an expert of dodging at the max (26:48 - 26:53)
raid battles uh I think again I think (26:50 - 26:56)
this is a problem I want to do like a I (26:53 - 26:57)
think I want to do like a longer YouTube (26:56 - 26:59)
video on this I I I think this is just a (26:57 - 27:02)
problem with Pokemon fans Not and (26:59 - 27:04)
there&#39;s nothing wrong with this I just (27:02 - 27:05)
think it&#39;s a problem with Pokemon fans (27:04 - 27:08)
not playing other games and not (27:05 - 27:11)
experiencing like raid culture cuz like (27:08 - 27:14)
yeah it is a lot of work to go to a (27:11 - 27:17)
place and get 40 people together and do (27:14 - 27:20)
something no one is denying that but on (27:17 - 27:22)
the other hand it&#39;s super cool to show (27:20 - 27:24)
up to a place and see 200 people doing (27:22 - 27:26)
the same thing as you do like that&#39;s (27:24 - 27:29)
super cool yeah in raid culture (27:26 - 27:31)
though and World of Warcraft has existed (27:29 - 27:35)
for like what 15 years it was a common (27:31 - 27:37)
thing to be like Tuesday nights are raid (27:35 - 27:41)
nights I am I am blocking off all of (27:37 - 27:43)
Tuesday night to do a raid when I did (27:41 - 27:48)
raids in in destiny that would be like I (27:43 - 27:52)
am blocking off four hours of my time (27:48 - 27:55)
because I that&#39;s how long this raid (27:52 - 27:58)
might be and those will come those come (27:55 - 28:00)
in Pokémon go that like that we&#39;re (27:58 - 28:02)
talking about the future though right (28:00 - 28:04)
we&#39;re talking about the future versus (28:02 - 28:06)
what it is right now we have a raid hour (28:04 - 28:08)
every week and you you can get groups of (28:06 - 28:11)
people together to go out hours I raate (28:08 - 28:13)
on the raid hour because I know people (28:11 - 28:16)
will show up and I I know what time it (28:13 - 28:18)
is and Wednesdays seem to work for me so (28:16 - 28:21)
like right um ex and that so that will (28:18 - 28:22)
happen we will get stronger Pokemon it (28:21 - 28:24)
will not take 40 people to do these in (28:22 - 28:27)
time and people will get used to the (28:24 - 28:29)
fact that this is the way it&#39;s done done (28:27 - 28:30)
and those things will (28:29 - 28:33)
happen and it&#39;s just that that&#39;s not (28:30 - 28:35)
happening right now but in a year from (28:33 - 28:37)
now I guarantee it will be much more (28:35 - 28:39)
like oh we all know how to do it and (28:37 - 28:40)
we&#39;re going out to do this one and the (28:39 - 28:42)
next one comes out we all know how to do (28:40 - 28:44)
it we all know what you need and people (28:42 - 28:46)
will go out and do it and it&#39;ll be fine (28:44 - 28:49)
but yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s just like week (28:46 - 28:55)
one you know was not the best week for (28:49 - 28:59)
them yeah totally I the the thing just (28:55 - 29:00)
real quick the thing that nitic said (28:59 - 29:03)
they did here is for Gengar they said (29:00 - 29:06)
they added a 25,000 Stardust reward for (29:03 - 29:08)
Gengar that&#39;s nice they said they (29:06 - 29:09)
increased the catch (29:08 - 29:13)
rate uh and then they said they adjusted (29:09 - 29:15)
the difficulty slightly compared to (29:13 - 29:18)
other gigantamax encounters that I&#39;m I&#39;m (29:15 - 29:20)
just reading what they literally told me (29:18 - 29:24)
we want gigantamax to be the high Bar (29:20 - 29:26)
for a meaningful challenge in Pokémon go (29:24 - 29:28)
but we also want to make sure players (29:26 - 29:30)
have a good chance of catching Gengar we (29:28 - 29:32)
want to make sure that trainers are (29:30 - 29:35)
strategizing and coordinating and uh (29:32 - 29:38)
going in powered up to a degree they&#39;re (29:35 - 29:40)
say they&#39;re literally saying you don&#39;t (29:38 - 29:42)
need to be level 50 your Pokemon don&#39;t (29:40 - 29:46)
need to be level 50 um uh we are (29:42 - 29:50)
slightly tuning this raid specifically (29:46 - 29:53)
Gengar and they are saying please update (29:50 - 29:55)
and clarify your post to say that these (29:53 - 30:01)
changes are only for Gengar and we may (29:55 - 30:04)
change future I don&#39;t know how to reword (30:01 - 30:06)
this they don&#39;t like when I copy and (30:04 - 30:07)
paste they&#39;re just saying like other (30:06 - 30:09)
raids might have other bonuses is (30:07 - 30:11)
ultimately what they&#39;re saying so like (30:09 - 30:14)
you know toxcity might not have 25,000 (30:11 - 30:17)
Stardust maybe it has 10,000 which I (30:14 - 30:19)
think would be bad for the record I (30:17 - 30:20)
actually really like the one of the best (30:19 - 30:22)
things they changed from all of this was (30:20 - 30:25)
the 25,000 Stardust yeah the Stardust (30:22 - 30:27)
and the catch rate increase both of (30:25 - 30:29)
those are important yeah yeah absolutely (30:27 - 30:31)
fantastic changes did when you at the (30:29 - 30:33)
end of The Raid when you can like pay a (30:31 - 30:35)
dollar to get double you end up with (30:33 - 30:37)
50,000 (30:35 - 30:40)
Stardust uh no because a stardust is 1.5 (30:37 - 30:41)
so it&#39;s like (30:40 - 30:44)
37 sure right right right whatever yeah (30:41 - 30:47)
cuz I I did I did a handful uh and then (30:44 - 30:49)
they they literally a day later they (30:47 - 30:51)
said we want to make sure we&#39;re setting (30:49 - 30:54)
right expectations when we say Gengar (30:51 - 30:57)
will be slightly easier it really is (30:54 - 31:01)
just slightly EAS EAS here see they (30:57 - 31:03)
learned here&#39;s what I here&#39;s what I (31:01 - 31:04)
think is actually going to happen and (31:03 - 31:07)
this is separate from what I Antica said (31:04 - 31:08)
I do think they like I don&#39;t think they (31:07 - 31:11)
lied I think they did make Gengar easier (31:08 - 31:13)
right but I I don&#39;t think they need to (31:11 - 31:17)
make future raids easier or (31:13 - 31:19)
they I don&#39;t think like future raids (31:17 - 31:21)
would be easier because now people (31:19 - 31:24)
have Charizards Blastoise (31:21 - 31:27)
Venusaur um and idea of how to actually (31:24 - 31:28)
do the battle (31:27 - 31:31)
yes and they know how to actually play (31:28 - 31:33)
the battles um I also think that there (31:31 - 31:35)
will be harder raids like there&#39;s no (31:33 - 31:39)
doubt in my mind a gmax melmetal is (31:35 - 31:41)
going to be harder than what we&#39;ve (31:39 - 31:43)
experienced there&#39;s no doubt in my mind (31:41 - 31:45)
that a gmax eternus will be harder than (31:43 - 31:49)
what we experience and (31:45 - 31:53)
um I I think that&#39;s fine too (31:49 - 31:58)
like like at one point Tyranitar (31:53 - 32:02)
was destroying groups of 12 people and (31:58 - 32:05)
now we could now you could easily do a (32:02 - 32:07)
Tyranitar Maybe by yourself or with one (32:05 - 32:11)
other person right Steve is scred from (32:07 - 32:11)
Tyranitar um like I don&#39;t think (32:12 - 32:18)
toxtricity in (32:16 - 32:22)
Fukuoka will be easier than Gengar or as (32:18 - 32:25)
easy as Gengar but also Fukuoka has the (32:22 - 32:27)
advantage of those people will be there (32:25 - 32:29)
in Fukuoka (32:27 - 32:33)
mhm doing that and you would assume that (32:29 - 32:35)
those people willing to travel and pay (32:33 - 32:37)
for a Pokemon event are slightly more (32:35 - 32:42)
hardcore than not are they doing Dynamax (32:37 - 32:44)
and gigantamax raids together for tox (32:42 - 32:47)
like can you do a Dynamax toxcity and (32:44 - 32:50)
not a gigantamax one yes so the the the (32:47 - 32:52)
Dynamax toxcity should be in four star (32:50 - 32:55)
raids we don&#39;t know how hard those are (32:52 - 32:58)
um the gigantamax will be in six (32:55 - 32:59)
we don&#39;t know what a fivestar raid looks (32:58 - 33:01)
like yet we don&#39;t know what a fourar (32:59 - 33:02)
raid looks like but they&#39;re also doing (33:01 - 33:06)
toxitricity just in regular raids and I (33:02 - 33:09)
think that&#39;s like a good I think that&#39;s (33:06 - 33:11)
honestly a good system of like here&#39;s (33:09 - 33:14)
your old raid style that you can remote (33:11 - 33:17)
into with your friends then tap tap tap (33:14 - 33:19)
turn your brain off don&#39;t have to think (33:17 - 33:20)
you already have counters because you&#39;ve (33:19 - 33:23)
had counters for seven years here is (33:20 - 33:25)
your um four star that you could (33:23 - 33:28)
probably do with like four people right (33:25 - 33:30)
right or three people and then here&#39;s (33:28 - 33:33)
your six-star where you do (33:30 - 33:38)
need 23 24 40 people to do I think (33:33 - 33:40)
that&#39;s great yeah um and before we get (33:38 - 33:43)
to break I think the one thing that also (33:40 - 33:45)
made people upset which I completely (33:43 - 33:47)
understand is powering (33:45 - 33:51)
up starters that will eventually have (33:47 - 33:54)
gmax forms so when you look at a Pokemon (33:51 - 33:56)
like greedent I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s (33:54 - 33:58)
like really upset to be like I&#39;m going (33:56 - 34:01)
power up a greedent because there is no (33:58 - 34:03)
gigantamax greedent so it doesn&#39;t feel (34:01 - 34:08)
like you&#39;re doing the cycle I I will say (34:03 - 34:11)
like at one point we all powered up (34:08 - 34:14)
vaporeons and we no one&#39;s using Vaporeon (34:11 - 34:16)
anymore CU we&#39;re all using kyogre&#39;s now (34:14 - 34:19)
so it is kind of that same Loop so it&#39;s (34:16 - 34:22)
like again kind of yeah it&#39;s kind of (34:19 - 34:26)
that same loop I do sincerely think that (34:22 - 34:29)
Max soup will come and I think we talked (34:26 - 34:30)
about this last (34:29 - 34:32)
week yeah like there&#39;s not a doubt in my (34:30 - 34:34)
mind (34:32 - 34:36)
that (34:34 - 34:37)
a (34:36 - 34:40)
whatever Charizard you powered up before (34:37 - 34:42)
this Gigan Max Charizard there&#39;s not a (34:40 - 34:43)
doubt in my mind that you won&#39;t be able (34:42 - 34:45)
to Max soup it in the next two years for (34:43 - 34:49)
only $10 per (34:45 - 34:52)
Pokemon yeah I it&#39;s it&#39;s not just the (34:49 - 34:54)
starters either I mean the the whole (34:52 - 34:57)
gigantamax Gengar being out right at the (34:54 - 34:59)
same time all the Dynamax Gastly are out (34:57 - 35:02)
I was able to do it Gastly uh that&#39;s one (34:59 - 35:04)
of my strongest Dynamax Pokemon now that (35:02 - 35:07)
I have for my teams well is it still a (35:04 - 35:09)
Gastly or did you evolve it I evolved it (35:07 - 35:11)
but I only evolved it and powered it up (35:09 - 35:14)
a little bit because I know that the gar (35:11 - 35:16)
that the gigantamax Gengar is out there (35:14 - 35:18)
and I was not able to do one of those (35:16 - 35:22)
this weekend well keep in mind that (35:18 - 35:25)
fun to be fair there is a difference (35:22 - 35:28)
like gigantamax Charizard can only gmax (35:25 - 35:32)
Wildfire that&#39;s all it can do my my (35:28 - 35:35)
Dynamax Charizard can Max Airstream so (35:32 - 35:39)
it&#39;s better against failinks than gmax (35:35 - 35:41)
Wildfire because one is hitting super (35:39 - 35:43)
effective so there there is like a (35:41 - 35:45)
slight difference it&#39;s not (35:43 - 35:47)
like I don&#39;t know I I talked about this (35:45 - 35:49)
again last week where like I don&#39;t feel (35:47 - 35:51)
bad powering up these Pokemon because (35:49 - 35:52)
they can learn different moves which (35:51 - 35:54)
gives them different gmax moves right (35:52 - 35:58)
like um Blastoise can only hydro cannon (35:54 - 36:00)
or whatever it&#39;s called canonade gmax (35:58 - 36:02)
canonade where the other ones can do a (36:00 - 36:04)
different move right like I think the (36:02 - 36:06)
dark if you teach a bite you can do Max (36:04 - 36:09)
Darkness yeah um but again you can leave (36:06 - 36:13)
these Pokemon in raid dens and assuming (36:09 - 36:15)
you live in an area where other people (36:13 - 36:16)
are doing raids you can get free candy (36:15 - 36:19)
so it&#39;s like I&#39;ll use you again (36:16 - 36:21)
eventually I don&#39;t need you this week so (36:19 - 36:22)
just sit in this gym and get candy for (36:21 - 36:27)
me um so (36:22 - 36:27)
wait Hannah did you do any gengars no I (36:28 - 36:32)
did not do any (36:31 - 36:35)
gengars I wanted to just couldn&#39;t get (36:32 - 36:39)
people around me uh I am up to 58 (36:35 - 36:43)
Dynamax raids and 33 gigantamax raids (36:39 - 36:46)
done how many Gengar did you (36:43 - 36:48)
do uh (36:46 - 36:54)
12 wow I did three on Friday night all (36:48 - 36:57)
for free and then I think I think I (36:54 - 37:02)
spent like $8 today and I did nine yeah (36:57 - 37:06)
cuz I said 12 yeah three and N yeah (37:02 - 37:10)
math yeah I did nine I I was just gonna (37:06 - 37:11)
I was going for something that was like (37:10 - 37:13)
decent because I was getting a lot of (37:11 - 37:15)
two stars um and then I got a shiny (37:13 - 37:17)
which wasn&#39;t like that great but I&#39;ll (37:15 - 37:19)
probably power it up and then I was like (37:17 - 37:21)
well on my way out I just kept getting (37:19 - 37:22)
stopped I was like well this one&#39;s (37:21 - 37:24)
filling up so I&#39;ll jump in this one (37:22 - 37:26)
honestly it was because it was because (37:24 - 37:28)
of the Stardust is why I was like I&#39;ll (37:26 - 37:29)
do a couple more because the Stardust (37:28 - 37:32)
was just so good yeah was this Mall of (37:29 - 37:34)
America yeah yeah okay I&#39;m just (37:32 - 37:35)
wondering like where you&#39;re going where (37:34 - 37:36)

drant yeah all America had 200 people (37:39 - 37:47)
rsvped for today they had 50 rsvpd for (37:43 - 37:50)
Friday night um and then there was a (37:47 - 37:52)
park I think it was downtown Minneapolis (37:50 - 37:53)
I don&#39;t remember what park it was they (37:52 - 37:56)

some people who live on like three Poké (38:11 - 38:15)
stops and a gym that is also (38:13 - 38:18)
significantly unfair I understand I wish (38:15 - 38:20)
I lived on like three Poké stops I would (38:18 - 38:23)
run my Plus+ nonstop it would never not (38:20 - 38:26)

ritual would be throwing away the 500 (38:26 - 38:32)
Pokemon I caught when I was sleeping I (38:28 - 38:34)
Pokemon go is unfair I understand I live (38:32 - 38:35)
in a big (38:34 - 38:38)
city the Plus+ doesn&#39;t work when it&#39;s (38:35 - 38:39)
plugged into the (38:38 - 38:42)
wall I&#39;m sure somebody will figure out (38:39 - 38:44)
oh wait I&#39;m sure I&#39;m sure somebody (38:42 - 38:46)
opened it up and cut a wire to make it (38:44 - 38:46)

this set has (41:05 - 41:10)
32 so they know what the people want I&#39;m (41:07 - 41:12)
assuming we&#39;re going to definitely get a (41:10 - 41:14)
special illustration rare of every (41:12 - 41:18)
evolution yeah I don&#39;t know maybe (41:14 - 41:19)
multiple maybe I don&#39;t know what else (41:18 - 41:21)
like they&#39;re going to do there with 32 (41:19 - 41:24)
of them uh that includes Pokemon and (41:21 - 41:26)
supporter cards um for the special (41:24 - 41:29)
illustration rares but mhm yeah I think (41:26 - 41:30)
overall this is going to be a great set (41:29 - 41:33)
this is the Japanese version of this set (41:30 - 41:36)
is called terrial festival and it comes (41:33 - 41:41)
out in December so I believe this set (41:36 - 41:43)
Prismatic Evolutions will be that set as (41:41 - 41:48)
well as there are nine Decks that are (41:43 - 41:51)
coming out in Japan in either November (41:48 - 41:53)
or December they each feature like one (41:51 - 41:56)
Legendary Pokémon along with uh (41:53 - 41:59)
non-legendary Pokemon so like except for (41:56 - 42:01)
Kanto it&#39;s Snorlax and Pikachu but each (41:59 - 42:03)
of these decks it&#39;s like Kyogre and blaz (42:01 - 42:06)
again or uh I think it was like tapu (42:03 - 42:08)
Coco and like mimikyu or something like (42:06 - 42:09)
that so each of the decks is like a (42:08 - 42:13)
separate one of those though some of the (42:09 - 42:14)
cards from those decks will also be (42:13 - 42:17)
featured in Prismatic evolutions on the (42:14 - 42:20)
international side uh so those two (42:17 - 42:25)
things make up that set um and yeah I&#39;m (42:20 - 42:26)
excited it comes out like five days (42:25 - 42:28)
before my birthday it&#39;s like perfect (42:26 - 42:30)
perfect birthday uh early birthday (42:28 - 42:33)
present for myself that I will (42:30 - 42:37)
buy so uh yeah this this went up on (42:33 - 42:39)
Friday on the Pokemon Center if I (42:37 - 42:43)
remember MH uh and I I don&#39;t know if (42:39 - 42:45)
this true or not I saw I saw one Tik Tok (42:43 - 42:48)
of somebody that said that it sold out (42:45 - 42:51)
within 10 hours yep that is which true (42:48 - 42:55)
because it&#39;s I tried to buy the ETB like (42:51 - 42:58)
about 8 hours after it came out and it (42:55 - 43:00)
was sold out uh on the Pokemon Center (42:58 - 43:02)
that was it looks like they only had the (43:00 - 43:04)
ETB though they didn&#39;t have any other (43:02 - 43:07)
boxes yeah and and to be fair there will (43:04 - 43:09)
be the ETB that is not Pokemon Center (43:07 - 43:11)
exclusive that will be available (43:09 - 43:13)
everywhere else right at the big box (43:11 - 43:15)
stores local card shops the only (43:13 - 43:16)
difference with the Pokemon Center (43:15 - 43:19)
exclusive one is you get the extra promo (43:16 - 43:21)
card you get a second promo card that (43:19 - 43:25)
has the Pokemon Center stamp on it um (43:21 - 43:27)
and you also the exclusive ETB had like (43:25 - 43:30)
one more just normal booster it has two (43:27 - 43:31)
more packs as well it&#39;s got 11 packs (43:30 - 43:33)
instead of nine so two more packs and (43:31 - 43:35)
then you get the extra promo card the (43:33 - 43:38)
promo card is an Eevee and it is (43:35 - 43:41)
incredibly cute so uh if you have a (43:38 - 43:42)
chance go look at the Pokemon Center (43:41 - 43:45)
website you will see that Eevee very (43:42 - 43:48)
cute there was a playm that went up card (43:45 - 43:50)
sleeves and a deck box that went up as (43:48 - 43:53)
well those all sold (43:50 - 43:56)
out yep of course they did (43:53 - 43:58)
understandable uh it&#39;s almost like they (43:56 - 44:01)
know that the Eevee line is incredibly (43:58 - 44:04)
popular so one thing that&#39;s interesting (44:01 - 44:07)
about this set is the box sets that they (44:04 - 44:11)
have for it are um very similar to the (44:07 - 44:12)
box sets that came out for (44:11 - 44:15)
151 so when 151 came out they had like a (44:12 - 44:18)
poster collection which came with three (44:15 - 44:20)
packs of cards and then a poster this (44:18 - 44:23)
has that as well they came with a binder (44:20 - 44:25)
collection so there was like a I don&#39;t (44:23 - 44:27)
know 10 page binder as well as five (44:25 - 44:30)
packs this has that there that&#39;s here as (44:27 - 44:32)
well uh the only difference is that that (44:30 - 44:35)
Eevee pouch collection thing that&#39;s new (44:32 - 44:36)
but that sounds like the coolest thing (44:35 - 44:40)
honestly yeah it looks looks interesting (44:36 - 44:41)
um and then there&#39;s of course there&#39;s (44:40 - 44:43)
booster bundles which if you&#39;re just (44:41 - 44:45)
looking for packs you&#39;re not looking for (44:43 - 44:47)
anything extra the booster bundles do (44:45 - 44:50)
come with six packs those usually sell (44:47 - 44:52)
out pretty quick since it&#39;s just six (44:50 - 44:54)
packs of (44:52 - 44:54)
cards uh other TCG news is uh this (44:56 - 45:01)
apparently launched yesterday the (44:59 - 45:05)
Greninja ex Ultra premium (45:01 - 45:09)
collection uh which is uh similar to (45:05 - 45:13)
like that 151 Mew collection they did (45:09 - 45:15)
okay uh this I I didn&#39;t even know that (45:13 - 45:18)
this was coming but it came out (45:15 - 45:21)
yesterday uh you get the fighting Terra (45:18 - 45:26)
type Greninja ex you get uh one etched (45:21 - 45:29)
foil card that&#39;s the metal one you get (45:26 - 45:32)
one fo you just get one regular (45:29 - 45:35)
card uh you (45:32 - 45:38)
get oh sorry you get the etched foil you (45:35 - 45:40)
get the regular foil you get the etched (45:38 - 45:41)
metal card that I just said you get a (45:40 - 45:44)
playmat a deck box a coin featuring (45:41 - 45:46)
ginja six damage dice they don&#39;t look (45:44 - 45:47)
that great they just they&#39;re just orange (45:46 - 45:48)
damage dice they&#39;re actually not that (45:47 - 45:52)
cool um two plastic condition markers (45:48 - 45:54)
and then 16 booster packs and then a (45:52 - 45:58)
code card for TCG live um (45:54 - 46:00)
I&#39;m sure this will sell well I mean the (45:58 - 46:04)
Charizard one did not though right (46:00 - 46:07)
charizarding but they I think they over (46:04 - 46:09)
printed they printed the Charizard one (46:07 - 46:12)
to the Moon Yeah well that was because (46:09 - 46:14)
the one before the Charizard one was the (46:12 - 46:18)
25th anniversary Pikachu one and that (46:14 - 46:22)
went so quick and then I think they were (46:18 - 46:23)
like well we should print more Charizard (46:22 - 46:25)
ones because these Pikachu ones sold out (46:23 - 46:27)
so quick and then everybody it was like (46:25 - 46:30)
no I&#39;m good well I mean there was a lot (46:27 - 46:31)
of like resellers that sat on the (46:30 - 46:34)
Charizard ones mhm yeah and then they (46:31 - 46:37)
kind of got I mean they kind of deserved (46:34 - 46:39)
it but they got kind of screwed over (46:37 - 46:40)
because uh you know you could walk into (46:39 - 46:42)
a Target and see a Charizard one at like (46:40 - 46:44)
80 bucks didn&#39;t they retail for like (46:42 - 46:47)
what 100 120 120 but they were literally (46:44 - 46:49)
on sale at Target or Walmart for like 80 (46:47 - 46:53)
bucks after a month or two you still see (46:49 - 46:55)
him from time to time the Charizard on (46:53 - 46:56)
still from time to time you&#39;ll you&#39;ll (46:55 - 46:57)
see him (46:56 - 47:00)
in in the store I think I have one (46:57 - 47:03)
unopen somewhere yeah cuz the sword the (47:00 - 47:05)
sword and shield packs themselves are (47:03 - 47:07)
starting to rise in price just because (47:05 - 47:10)
it&#39;s becoming a little bit older but (47:07 - 47:12)
yeah I mean I would say like this summer (47:10 - 47:14)
you were you were still seeing Charizard (47:12 - 47:17)
upcs sitting in stores so not nearly as (47:14 - 47:20)
popular I think there&#39;s also the (47:17 - 47:22)
Greninja one just came out and there&#39;s a (47:20 - 47:24)
tagos one that either came out already (47:22 - 47:28)
or is coming out I feel like that one is (47:24 - 47:31)
coming out okay I do remember that I (47:28 - 47:33)
thought that was going to be around the (47:31 - 47:36)
Stellar Crown time frame but maybe (47:33 - 47:38)
not (47:36 - 47:42)
um yeah not sure why they&#39;re doing so (47:38 - 47:44)
many of them like I don&#39;t know why (47:42 - 47:45)
there&#39;s no way they&#39;re not doing these (47:44 - 47:47)
because they&#39;re just super good holiday (47:45 - 47:50)
gifts right I guess (47:47 - 47:53)
maybe like a kid ripping open like that (47:50 - 47:55)
Charizard box on Christmas and then the (47:53 - 47:57)
dad crying cuz they bought it from a (47:55 - 48:00)
reseller for 200 and then crying again (47:57 - 48:01)
after Christmas when they see it in (48:00 - 48:04)
Target for 80 (48:01 - 48:04)
bucks the emotional roller coaster that (48:04 - 48:12)
is buying Pokemon cards such is (48:07 - 48:12)
life um yeah those are those are the new (48:14 - 48:21)
sets and did surging Sparks comes out (48:18 - 48:24)
next week comes out on Friday yeah yes (48:21 - 48:26)
this this coming Friday as we record I (48:24 - 48:28)
think um (48:26 - 48:30)
the Embargo on that is lifted not that I (48:28 - 48:33)
always think embargo on English cards is (48:30 - 48:36)
funny because they&#39;re just Japanese ones (48:33 - 48:38)
are already (48:36 - 48:41)
Japanese like I understand it I totally (48:38 - 48:45)
get it I I that&#39;s still funny um I (48:41 - 48:47)
opened up some surging Sparks uh and (48:45 - 48:49)
then that&#39;s that&#39;s on YouTube right now (48:47 - 48:51)
if you want to see me open they they I I (48:49 - 48:53)
I guess I can give some behind the (48:51 - 48:54)
scenes I kind of sa this in the the (48:53 - 48:59)
video they we did the Stellar maze thing (48:54 - 49:01)
and then they shut down the Stellar maze (48:59 - 49:02)
they kicked everyone out and then there (49:01 - 49:04)
was like six of us where they were like (49:02 - 49:07)
here&#39;s 20 packs of surging Sparks you (49:04 - 49:10)
can open it and make a video and like (49:07 - 49:11)
that&#39;s not my normal content I just (49:10 - 49:13)
don&#39;t like rip open packs and throw it (49:11 - 49:15)
up on YouTube not that there&#39;s anything (49:13 - 49:17)
wrong with it it&#39;s just not what I do it (49:15 - 49:19)
doesn&#39;t ever do well on my YouTube this (49:17 - 49:20)
is me telling you to please watch that (49:19 - 49:22)
video (49:20 - 49:26)
um but I was like slightly unprepared (49:22 - 49:29)
and like some content creators went off (49:26 - 49:30)
and they like did their own thing where (49:29 - 49:32)
they did like a group thing and I was (49:30 - 49:34)
like ah I don&#39;t like doing group stuff (49:32 - 49:39)
anyways uh anyways as they they give (49:34 - 49:41)
they pair us all up with a Pokemon (49:39 - 49:43)
employee so the Pokemon employee there&#39;s (49:41 - 49:46)
one Pokemon employee per content creator (49:43 - 49:48)
and the job of the Pokemon employee was (49:46 - 49:50)
to just make sure that they got all the (49:48 - 49:52)
cards back because the rule (49:50 - 49:56)
was you couldn&#39;t keep the cards and I (49:52 - 49:59)
opened 20 packs and I got 10 hits out of (49:56 - 50:03)
20 packs which is wild crazy good and (49:59 - 50:06)
there were cards keep I know there were (50:03 - 50:08)
cards that I like genuinely liked I was (50:06 - 50:10)
like oh my gosh I wanted this card and (50:08 - 50:13)
then it&#39;s just here you go I don&#39;t know (50:10 - 50:15)
where they&#39;re gonna end up not not in my (50:13 - 50:20)
hands did um did do you know when they (50:15 - 50:22)
handed you the packs did they just hand (50:20 - 50:24)
you a stack of 20 packs or did they pull (50:22 - 50:27)
it from like a booster box or something (50:24 - 50:29)
I&#39;ve I I didn&#39;t see a booster box I saw (50:27 - 50:31)
them open just like a backpack and just (50:29 - 50:34)
pull out all these packs from this (50:31 - 50:37)
backpack it seemed real shady (50:34 - 50:39)
honestly they should sell that they (50:37 - 50:41)
should sell like backpacks full of packs (50:39 - 50:43)
that would be great like that would be (50:41 - 50:45)
that would be good it&#39;s like that (50:43 - 50:46)
mystery (50:45 - 50:49)
box except it&#39;s a backpack and you don&#39;t (50:46 - 50:51)
know what&#39;s (50:49 - 50:53)
inside speaking of that mystery box (50:51 - 50:55)
before we take one more break and switch (50:53 - 50:57)
over to TCG pocket (50:55 - 51:02)
um I saw two people get the same exact (50:57 - 51:06)
mystery box one person I saw just on a (51:02 - 51:07)
Tik Tok I was like oh somebody got on (51:06 - 51:09)
Tik Tok I watched them open it I was (51:07 - 51:11)
like okay cool like exactly what you (51:09 - 51:15)
expect it was like two plushes a hat the (51:11 - 51:18)
F was the image were they from the image (51:15 - 51:20)
uh one was a taguri and then one was (51:18 - 51:21)
like a Charizard plush so both of those (51:20 - 51:23)
were in the image (51:21 - 51:27)
yes um I&#39;m saying and then somebody (51:23 - 51:29)
tweeted at me I&#39;m super sorry I can&#39;t (51:27 - 51:30)
remember they tweeted at me and they (51:29 - 51:32)
were like I got the box here&#39;s what was (51:30 - 51:35)
inside and it was identical to the one (51:32 - 51:39)
on Tik Tok oh no crazy oh be and it (51:35 - 51:42)
would make sense if it was identical if (51:39 - 51:44)
there was a very limited number of (51:42 - 51:46)
things that were in them like the images (51:44 - 51:49)
showed yeah that&#39;s no okay okay so (51:46 - 51:51)
somebody opened it and they had like (51:49 - 51:53)
they got like a small of in their box I (51:51 - 51:55)
don&#39;t think oh also the trapos box is (51:53 - 51:58)
out um good uh I don&#39;t think there was (51:55 - 52:01)
ever a small live in the special like I (51:58 - 52:02)
can&#39;t even find out I&#39;m looking at I&#39;m (52:01 - 52:04)
looking right now was there there was no (52:02 - 52:06)
small in the in the (52:04 - 52:09)
art it there was a small of somewhere (52:06 - 52:12)
was there taguri because I saw a lot of (52:09 - 52:14)
people getting tasu there was a tatary (52:12 - 52:15)

Bobby was right I saw one person get a (52:58 - 53:04)
Meowth the statue of the Meowth and then (53:01 - 53:06)

meow of f f PE statue those are both in (53:06 - 53:14)
the image those are both in the image (53:10 - 53:17)
yep um um we need to take a break I&#39;m (53:14 - 53:19)
just reading descriptions I&#39;m just (53:17 - 53:20)
reading descriptions it&#39;s (53:19 - 53:24)
all how dare they do honest marketing on (53:20 - 53:27)
this podcast (53:24 - 53:28)
if you got something that is not in the (53:27 - 53:33)
image we need to know I there&#39;s no way (53:28 - 53:35)
they didn&#39;t have extra Kakuna plushes (53:33 - 53:38)
that they weren&#39;t putting in those (53:35 - 53:38)
boxes there&#39;s no (53:38 - 53:43)
way (53:41 - 53:45)
okay when we come back we&#39;re going to (53:43 - 53:48)
talk about TCG pocket so we&#39;ll be right (53:45 - 53:53)
back and we are back from our break TCG (53:48 - 53:56)
pocket is here came out on October 30th (53:53 - 53:58)
for most well I depending on where you (53:56 - 54:01)
live it came out at some time uh it&#39;s (53:58 - 54:03)
here uh it (54:01 - 54:06)
is it&#39;s it&#39;s an app I I I played it (54:03 - 54:08)
early I played it while I was in New (54:06 - 54:11)
York uh I shared all my thoughts I think (54:08 - 54:13)
we did a podcast and then I think I did (54:11 - 54:15)
like two videos on it or something like (54:13 - 54:21)
that but um let&#39;s start with with Hannah (54:15 - 54:26)
what did I overhype it uh maybe a little (54:21 - 54:28)
bit but it really depends on who&#39;s (54:26 - 54:29)
playing it really depends on who&#39;s (54:28 - 54:32)
playing I am clearly not the TCG person (54:29 - 54:35)
on this podcast I buying Pokemon cards (54:32 - 54:37)
like I get Pokemon cards for Christmas (54:35 - 54:38)
and that makes me happy but other than (54:37 - 54:41)
that buying Pokemon cards is not (54:38 - 54:42)
something that&#39;s been in my budget for (54:41 - 54:45)
very much of the time even as an adult (54:42 - 54:49)
for me there&#39;s a Greninja ex box in your (54:45 - 54:52)
future under the (54:49 - 54:54)
tree just because they&#39;ve got to sell (54:52 - 54:58)
out of them oh but I&#39;m enjoying opening (54:54 - 55:00)
two packs a day I&#39;m not going to pay for (54:58 - 55:03)
this I unless they come out with (55:00 - 55:05)
something I really really really want I (55:03 - 55:07)
am definitely not planning on paying for (55:05 - 55:11)
this I&#39;ve done two battles one with Auto (55:07 - 55:13)
on and one with auto off and I think (55:11 - 55:18)
they&#39;re fine it&#39;s a little Snappy um (55:13 - 55:19)
there are a couple of the animations (55:18 - 55:21)
that are a little offputting just a (55:19 - 55:24)
little too fast but other than that I (55:21 - 55:26)
like opening the cards and I got really (55:24 - 55:28)
lucky with one of my packs this (55:26 - 55:31)
week yeah you got a you got a God pack (55:28 - 55:34)
yes yeah yes I (55:31 - 55:37)
did which is I think like a one in 2,000 (55:34 - 55:39)
chance or something it&#39;s pretty and it (55:37 - 55:41)
was all different Pokemon and they were (55:39 - 55:44)
all full art it was a very very good (55:41 - 55:46)
pack it was like an it was an amazing (55:44 - 55:47)
God pack on top of it just being a God (55:46 - 55:49)
pack Bobby you want to explain what a (55:47 - 55:52)
God pack is to they exist in real life (55:49 - 55:55)
they&#39;re not exclusive yeah they exist in (55:52 - 55:58)
Japanese uh in like special sets in (55:55 - 56:01)
Japanese where um let&#39;s say for instance (55:58 - 56:04)
you have a set that has Shiny Pokemon a (56:01 - 56:06)
God pack it&#39;s like every card in the (56:04 - 56:09)
pack is a is a hit quote unquote hit so (56:06 - 56:11)
like is like the shiny Pokemon or like (56:09 - 56:12)
an EX card or something along those (56:11 - 56:15)
lines so rather than get like the common (56:12 - 56:19)
uncommon cards you&#39;re just getting the (56:15 - 56:21)
double rare or higher for every single (56:19 - 56:24)
card in the pack and so that is a God (56:21 - 56:26)
pack and Hannah you got like the best (56:24 - 56:30)
God pack I&#39;ve seen so far I had a Cubone (56:26 - 56:32)
I don&#39;t know how to describe any of them (56:30 - 56:34)
I can say full art or not but I don&#39;t (56:32 - 56:37)
Know full art Cubone yeah Cubone a (56:34 - 56:41)
Mewtwo EX a Dragonite and two different (56:37 - 56:42)
Articuno (56:41 - 56:45)
ex I thought you got the gold Pikachu am (56:42 - 56:47)
I misremembering no I got the gold (56:45 - 56:50)
Mewtwo oh the gold Mewtwo oh that&#39;s the (56:47 - 56:52)
that&#39;s the rare one yeah that&#39;s the (56:50 - 56:54)
that&#39;s like the hyper rare right there (56:52 - 56:55)
yeah I guess you have the full art and (56:54 - 56:57)
then you have like almost like the (56:55 - 56:59)
illustration rare so like you got like I (56:57 - 57:00)
think you got like the full art Articuno (56:59 - 57:02)
and then you got like the illustration (57:00 - 57:05)
rare Articuno two different yeah so I (57:02 - 57:06)
guess it&#39;s like special illustration (57:05 - 57:08)
rare Cubone technically yeah because (57:06 - 57:10)
it&#39;s like an illustration of Cubone (57:08 - 57:12)
illustration yeah I think that&#39;s I don&#39;t (57:10 - 57:13)
know how they&#39;re expl I don&#39;t know how (57:12 - 57:15)
they&#39;re explaining it for like (57:13 - 57:17)
officially but I would I would imagine (57:15 - 57:20)
like if it&#39;s a regular Pokemon like (57:17 - 57:22)
Cubone that&#39;s like an illustration rare (57:20 - 57:25)
and then if it&#39;s an ex like Articuno ex (57:22 - 57:27)
that&#39;d be like a special illustration (57:25 - 57:29)
that&#39;s how it goes in back in my day we (57:27 - 57:33)
had common uncommon (57:29 - 57:33)
rare that was (57:33 - 57:40)
it uh Bobby did I overhype this app no (57:35 - 57:44)
you did not you did not uh this app is (57:40 - 57:47)
amazing so I will (57:44 - 57:51)
say that Pokemon (57:47 - 57:54)
go while I love Pokemon go I think it (57:51 - 57:57)
has dropped to maybe my third Pokemon (57:54 - 58:00)
mobile game because sleep sleep is sleep (57:57 - 58:03)
is second but I think pocket has like (58:00 - 58:08)
just it quickly jumped up for me uh it (58:03 - 58:12)
like I I love opening packs is great (58:08 - 58:14)
just as someone who loves opening packs (58:12 - 58:18)
um I have spent money on the game um not (58:14 - 58:21)
not a lot but I have spent money um (58:18 - 58:23)
opening packs is great and then the (58:21 - 58:27)
battling is the battling is ex exactly (58:23 - 58:31)
what I have always wanted the TCG online (58:27 - 58:33)
to be like and I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s (58:31 - 58:35)
anything wrong with the TCG it&#39;s just (58:33 - 58:39)
that when I&#39;m wanting to play the TCG I (58:35 - 58:41)
don&#39;t want to play like a 30 or four I (58:39 - 58:43)
don&#39;t want to sit down and like not know (58:41 - 58:44)
if it&#39;s going to take 30 or 40 minutes (58:43 - 58:46)
to play a (58:44 - 58:48)
match and the way that the battling (58:46 - 58:51)
Works in Pocket (58:48 - 58:55)
is wonderful for me like it&#39;s just quick (58:51 - 58:57)
matches and but but it still gives you (58:55 - 59:00)
that same feeling of playing the (58:57 - 59:03)
TCG similar strategies like obviously (59:00 - 59:04)
the game is different smaller decks (59:03 - 59:07)
things like that but it&#39;s just I think (59:04 - 59:10)
the battling is really fun and it&#39;s just (59:07 - 59:12)
cool to be able to do that so it&#39;s like (59:10 - 59:14)
yeah you can open packs and you&#39;re (59:12 - 59:16)
collecting your stuff which is wonderful (59:14 - 59:18)
and then on the times when you can&#39;t (59:16 - 59:19)
open your packs you know you can still (59:18 - 59:21)
just pop in and you know you can do a (59:19 - 59:23)
couple battles you can build a new deck (59:21 - 59:25)
try new decks out things like that it&#39;s (59:23 - 59:28)
uh I just think it&#39;s really fun I&#39;m (59:25 - 59:29)
loving it so (59:28 - 59:33)
far yeah uh I have to give a disclosure (59:29 - 59:36)
here the Pokemon company sent me a $100 (59:33 - 59:39)
iTunes gift card nice I guess I could (59:36 - 59:41)
have spent it on anything hon now that (59:39 - 59:42)
I&#39;m thinking about it I could have put (59:41 - 59:43)
it into Pokemon (59:42 - 59:46)
sleep I think they they they said we (59:43 - 59:50)
hope you enjoy Pokemon (59:46 - 59:50)
pocket but I now that I&#39;m thinking of it (59:50 - 59:55)
ah I could have put 50 in a sleeve 50 in (59:53 - 59:57)
a pocket that&#39;s okay I (59:55 - 59:59)
it&#39;s (59:57 - 60:04)
fine um yeah there&#39;s no uh there&#39;s no (59:59 - 60:06)
place to enter codes this is what I said (60:04 - 60:08)
you know two months ago there there&#39;s (60:06 - 60:11)
just no code spot like unite or like TCG (60:08 - 60:14)
live or Pokemon go even though Pokemon (60:11 - 60:17)
go uses like a website to enter code (60:14 - 60:19)
cards um yeah there there&#39;s not it&#39;s (60:17 - 60:21)
just like well I mean it&#39;s a DNA game so (60:19 - 60:23)
just like Pokemon Masters just no place (60:21 - 60:25)
to redeem (60:23 - 60:26)
anything um (60:25 - 60:27)
it (60:26 - 60:31)
is exactly what I played uh the little (60:27 - 60:34)
trading button is is grayed out the the (60:31 - 60:39)
sets are the same um Wonder pick is more (60:34 - 60:40)
interesting than I thought it was going (60:39 - 60:42)
to be it was like really hard to like (60:40 - 60:45)
Wonder pick while I played it because (60:42 - 60:46)
you just wonder picked once and then (60:45 - 60:48)
that was kind of it and we only had the (60:46 - 60:50)
app for like two three hours it&#39;s not (60:48 - 60:52)
like we saw it refreshing also wonder (60:50 - 60:54)
pick is based off of other people wonder (60:52 - 60:58)
picking so when you have (60:54 - 61:01)
so there wasn&#39;t like a lot of options (60:58 - 61:05)
um otherwise I played like a Lapras (61:01 - 61:07)
event uh that&#39;s actually what I did I (61:05 - 61:09)
did a lot of battles at the New York (61:07 - 61:11)
thing because I like Bobby this the (61:09 - 61:14)
battle system is exactly what I want in (61:11 - 61:17)
a mobile battle system (61:14 - 61:22)
um and that Lapras event is not there uh (61:17 - 61:23)
although I (61:22 - 61:25)
think I saw on Twitter that like it was (61:23 - 61:27)
coming soon or it was like announced on (61:25 - 61:28)
like a Japanese thing that the Lapras (61:27 - 61:32)
event was coming I saw that too (61:28 - 61:34)
so it&#39;s everything I want like it&#39;s it&#39;s (61:32 - 61:38)
great uh like I&#39;m still very high on it (61:34 - 61:40)
I&#39;m still very positive about it I I I (61:38 - 61:43)
still think it&#39;s such a cool thing and (61:40 - 61:48)
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s made a ton of money so (61:43 - 61:51)
far I think I think um it&#39;s just like (61:48 - 61:53)
the nature (61:51 - 61:55)
of I want to open a couple more packs (61:53 - 61:58)
let me just put like $10 into the game (61:55 - 62:00)
cuz like ultimately like $10 gets you 10 (61:58 - 62:01)
packs it&#39;s like realistically it&#39;s like (62:00 - 62:05)
$12 cuz it&#39;s 60 it&#39;s six gold per pack (62:01 - 62:07)
yeah you need 120 gold to open it so (62:05 - 62:09)
it&#39;s it&#39;s (62:07 - 62:12)
$112 (62:09 - 62:12)
um I think complaint wise I don&#39;t want (62:12 - 62:16)
to be like okay here&#39;s all the (62:15 - 62:19)
complaints I I knew that this was going (62:16 - 62:22)
to be a complaint it&#39;s people being like (62:19 - 62:23)
well I opened my two packs I did my (62:22 - 62:25)
wonder trade I&#39;ve done the test I&#39;ve (62:23 - 62:28)
done the like C battles there&#39;s nothing (62:25 - 62:29)
else to (62:28 - 62:34)
Doh and that&#39;s 100% valid but that is (62:29 - 62:36)
the TCG I mean that that is the that is (62:34 - 62:38)
the TCG right like you can go to Target (62:36 - 62:40)
you can buy a bunch of packs you can rip (62:38 - 62:41)
them (62:40 - 62:44)
open and you&#39;re done like that&#39;s what (62:41 - 62:48)
it&#39;s been for 20 29 years like you can (62:44 - 62:50)
put those together and play against (62:48 - 62:53)
somebody mhm you can totally do that and (62:50 - 62:54)
you can do that in this game you can (62:53 - 62:56)
just jump online and play against (62:54 - 62:59)
somebody there is no ladder which I (62:56 - 63:03)
think will add longevity to the game mhm (62:59 - 63:05)
um but I (63:03 - 63:08)
I I think it was smart for them not to (63:05 - 63:10)
release a (63:08 - 63:12)
ladder um I think it was ethical for (63:10 - 63:14)
them not to release a ladder I think if (63:12 - 63:17)
the game launched with a ladder it would (63:14 - 63:20)
pressure people into spending money to (63:17 - 63:23)
then try to get a competitive deck to (63:20 - 63:28)
then go on ladder since there is no risk (63:23 - 63:30)
or there there there is no like penalty (63:28 - 63:33)
for going online and losing to somebody (63:30 - 63:36)
there&#39;s just not so it it the whole (63:33 - 63:38)
thing feels so low risk of like it (63:36 - 63:42)
legitimately at this point in the stages (63:38 - 63:45)
feels like I&#39;m just playing somebody at (63:42 - 63:47)
a league or I&#39;m just playing my (63:45 - 63:51)
significant other uh on the couch and we (63:47 - 63:54)
had fun and that was and that&#39;s okay um (63:51 - 63:56)
but I think for long term there does do (63:54 - 63:58)
need to be a ranked but I think it was (63:56 - 64:00)
smart for them to be like well if we do (63:58 - 64:03)
a ranked at launch people are going to (64:00 - 64:06)
feel people even if you even if you&#39;re (64:03 - 64:08)
okay with spending money you&#39;re going to (64:06 - 64:10)
turn off the people that don&#39;t want to (64:08 - 64:12)
spend money because they&#39;re literally (64:10 - 64:14)
going to say this is pay to (64:12 - 64:17)
win I can&#39;t afford to open 20 booster (64:14 - 64:19)
packs I don&#39;t have a mew2 ex I don&#39;t (64:17 - 64:22)
have a gavor I don&#39;t have a Pidgeot like (64:19 - 64:24)
I don&#39;t want to do this anymore you know (64:22 - 64:28)
what&#39;s pay to win the TCG (64:24 - 64:28)
I mean to be very Frank yeah it (64:28 - 64:35)
it it is always able to open being able (64:32 - 64:37)
to open two free packs a day is a big (64:35 - 64:41)
step up from that yes yeah I wish I (64:37 - 64:42)
could go to Target and just pull two (64:41 - 64:44)
packs off the rack be like these are my (64:42 - 64:47)
two free Pokemon packs today I&#39;m sure (64:44 - 64:48)
there&#39;s somebody out there getting two (64:47 - 64:50)
free packs a day at Target well yeah I (64:48 - 64:53)
mean yes (64:50 - 64:53)
unfortunately um yeah I I there is a big (64:53 - 65:03)
money aspect behind competitive TCG in (64:59 - 65:07)
person for sure 100% like I remember (65:03 - 65:10)
doing the last chance qualifier back in (65:07 - 65:14)
uh was it 2010 or 2011 where it was like (65:10 - 65:17)
the best deck right now is four meww and (65:14 - 65:19)
four dark four meww EXs four dark cry (65:17 - 65:23)
EXs meww ex is $80 dark cry ex is (65:19 - 65:26)
$65 do I I have two of each (65:23 - 65:29)
but the best deck is four of each I I do (65:26 - 65:32)
I spend the money for these cards or do (65:29 - 65:34)
I just go in with what I&#39;m currently (65:32 - 65:36)
using right um when sun and moon came (65:34 - 65:39)
out the best card at the time was tapu (65:36 - 65:42)
Lele was an 80 card and most Deb almost (65:39 - 65:44)
every single deck out there required two (65:42 - 65:47)
to three tapu Lele (65:44 - 65:51)
um now I do (65:47 - 65:54)
think they need to introduce trading (65:51 - 65:56)
which does have a little button that (65:54 - 65:59)
says coming soon I do think they need to (65:56 - 66:01)
do that before A ranked ladder I think (65:59 - 66:03)
that does alleviate a lot of that where (66:01 - 66:06)
it&#39;s like Bobby I got three (66:03 - 66:09)
meww you can just have one like you if (66:06 - 66:11)
you&#39;re missing it I don&#39;t care here just (66:09 - 66:13)
take it you can trade me whatever (66:11 - 66:15)
although we don&#39;t know how trading works (66:13 - 66:16)
because there&#39;s (66:15 - 66:18)
nothing there&#39;s nothing you can do with (66:16 - 66:19)
your with your duplicates at this point (66:18 - 66:22)
right they&#39;re just you just have them I (66:19 - 66:25)
mean you get rewards for some of them (66:22 - 66:27)
true true (66:25 - 66:29)
but you can crush (66:27 - 66:32)
them sad and turn them into (66:29 - 66:35)
dust it it is like ctstone and whatnot (66:32 - 66:37)
you you can you can crush your (66:35 - 66:39)
duplicates cuz I saw people would buy a (66:37 - 66:41)
bunch of like pokeballs with the tickets (66:39 - 66:43)
and then crush the pokeballs to then (66:41 - 66:45)
make their Pokeball Sparkle I think it&#39;s (66:43 - 66:48)
called like flare flare yeah yeah add (66:45 - 66:51)
flare so okay uh unrelated question but (66:48 - 66:55)
I have not played Marvel snap how much (66:51 - 66:59)
like that game is this it&#39;s less like it (66:55 - 67:00)
than I thought it was going to be like I (66:59 - 67:03)
I played Marvel Snap I&#39;ve played it for (67:00 - 67:05)
a good week or two not as long as I (67:03 - 67:08)
expected um for just kind of in (67:05 - 67:10)
preparation for this game so that I (67:08 - 67:12)
could (67:10 - 67:16)
compare I mean Marvel snap is not the (67:12 - 67:19)
same sort of trading card game in (67:16 - 67:22)
battles that Pokemon is these are very (67:19 - 67:26)
much very clearly Pokemon TCG (67:22 - 67:27)
battles (67:26 - 67:31)
matches that is kind of I mean they&#39;re (67:27 - 67:34)
not the same as outside of the app but (67:31 - 67:37)
it&#39;s very clearly a Pokemon (67:34 - 67:41)
TCG game uh Marvel snap is a totally (67:37 - 67:42)
different kind of almost reminds me more (67:41 - 67:46)
of a tabletop game um okay where there&#39;s (67:42 - 67:50)
just I don&#39;t want to say less going (67:46 - 67:52)
on you heard it here first Marvel snap (67:50 - 67:56)
is boring no (67:52 - 67:59)
it&#39;s just it it plays very very (67:56 - 68:02)
differently and it is almost entirely uh (67:59 - 68:05)
focused on the matches whereas this app (68:02 - 68:07)
is a lot more focused on the collection (68:05 - 68:10)
which I like a lot yeah yeah they did (68:07 - 68:13)
say that this was a card collecting app (68:10 - 68:16)
first I I still think if you go to the (68:13 - 68:19)
Pokemon uh TCG pocket website there (68:16 - 68:22)
isn&#39;t a mention of battling on the (68:19 - 68:25)
website (68:22 - 68:25)
yeah I I think the battling is super (68:26 - 68:33)
good yeah um like it&#39;s very it&#39;s (68:29 - 68:37)
definitely in the very early stages of (68:33 - 68:38)
there&#39;s only (68:37 - 68:41)
263 cards or something like that so of (68:38 - 68:44)
course and of course with any card game (68:41 - 68:46)
competitive game whatever there&#39;s always (68:44 - 68:48)
going to be a meta there&#39;s always going (68:46 - 68:49)
to be cards that are better than other (68:48 - 68:51)
cards so there&#39;s already like some Decks (68:49 - 68:54)
that are better than others just there (68:51 - 68:57)
just how these things work right um but (68:54 - 69:00)
I think as they add more cards that like (68:57 - 69:04)
will rotate some cards in some cards out (69:00 - 69:08)
um so I I think that&#39;s cool I anytime (69:04 - 69:09)
somebody has ever been like Steve I want (69:08 - 69:11)
to learn how to play the trading card (69:09 - 69:13)
game I would always say like go play (69:11 - 69:16)
ptcgo or go play ptcg live because I I (69:13 - 69:19)
sincerely think that the way those games (69:16 - 69:23)
teach you is really good interface wise (69:19 - 69:28)
live is very ugly cow just not a (69:23 - 69:31)
aesthetically looking good game it&#39;s (69:28 - 69:34)
very ugly but at least they have figured (69:31 - 69:36)
out like the proper way to teach people (69:34 - 69:39)
and I think pocket also is really good (69:36 - 69:42)
at teaching you how to play yeah and I (69:39 - 69:44)
do like how the missions are set up to (69:42 - 69:47)
be like hey maybe you should build a (69:44 - 69:49)
grass deck here okay maybe you should (69:47 - 69:51)
build an electric deck okay maybe you (69:49 - 69:53)
should build a metal deck maybe you (69:51 - 69:56)
should build a Darkness deck so and the (69:53 - 69:58)
auto (69:56 - 70:02)
build I think is pretty good honestly (69:58 - 70:04)
yeah again it helps that there&#39;s not (70:02 - 70:07)
that many cards in the (70:04 - 70:09)
game right but I think I think the Auto (70:07 - 70:11)
Battle is really good I think the auto (70:09 - 70:15)
build is really good I think (70:11 - 70:18)
that it is a really good way to get (70:15 - 70:22)
people interested so when they do (70:18 - 70:24)
introduce a I&#39;m really banking on them (70:22 - 70:25)
introducing a ladder like I sincerely (70:24 - 70:26)
think they do they&#39;ve never confirmed (70:25 - 70:29)
this for the record like when we asked (70:26 - 70:32)
them in person they were like we know (70:29 - 70:34)
that people would be interested in a (70:32 - 70:36)
ranked (70:34 - 70:36)
mode it would add a lot more to the game (70:37 - 70:43)
for sure yeah but but it would also (70:41 - 70:46)
change the entire focus of the app right (70:43 - 70:49)
because to my point from a few minutes (70:46 - 70:51)
ago the website doesn&#39;t even mention the (70:49 - 70:53)
battling they&#39;re going to add ranked (70:51 - 70:54)
they&#39;re going to have to mention (70:53 - 70:56)
battling on the website if they&#39;re going (70:54 - 70:58)
to do something like that right like (70:56 - 71:02)
their focus is very much very heavy on (70:58 - 71:05)
hey you&#39;re here to collect cards you&#39;re (71:02 - 71:06)
here to I mean just the fact that you (71:05 - 71:09)
can do the little dis you can put a card (71:06 - 71:12)
in a display or you can set up a binder (71:09 - 71:14)
which is Awesome by the way you can (71:12 - 71:17)
search by artist so you can have like (71:14 - 71:19)
you can set up a binder and then just (71:17 - 71:21)
have like your favorite artist&#39;s cards (71:19 - 71:23)
in the binder and everything like that (71:21 - 71:26)
like ah this app is so good it&#39;s great I (71:23 - 71:27)
love (71:26 - 71:30)
it uh there is an event going on right (71:27 - 71:32)
now their first event uh which is the (71:30 - 71:35)
Wonder pick event part one is the (71:32 - 71:38)
official a really bad title to the event (71:35 - 71:42)
but uh it literally called Wonder event (71:38 - 71:46)
Wonder pick event part one um it&#39;s it (71:42 - 71:48)
features chansy and (71:46 - 71:53)
Meowth and um every hour for my (71:48 - 71:55)
understanding of how it works there&#39;s a (71:53 - 71:57)
chance that you either get like a chansy (71:55 - 71:59)
pick or a Meowth pick or just a free (71:57 - 72:02)
pick so it encourages you to open the (71:59 - 72:04)
app frequently I believe it goes until (72:02 - 72:06)
November 22nd and then ideally there&#39;s (72:04 - 72:08)
two promo cards there&#39;s the chansy promo (72:06 - 72:10)
card and the meth promo card if if (72:08 - 72:12)
you&#39;re a collector you probably want two (72:10 - 72:13)
of each because you&#39;re allowed two of (72:12 - 72:17)
each in your deck um and then there&#39;s uh (72:13 - 72:20)
three Cosmetics you can buy with the (72:17 - 72:23)
event tickets uh another slight problem (72:20 - 72:25)
with the game there&#39;s like 7 million (72:23 - 72:26)
currenc (72:25 - 72:28)
it&#39;s really hard to keep track of like (72:26 - 72:31)
what is doing what yeah but you can (72:28 - 72:33)
they&#39;re three each so you just need nine (72:31 - 72:35)
tickets alt together to get it but it&#39;s (72:33 - 72:38)
like two meowths and then like a plant (72:35 - 72:40)
like a flower pink planter thing that (72:38 - 72:42)
you can get (72:40 - 72:45)
um so that that&#39;s cool like it it is (72:42 - 72:47)
smart that they did an event right away (72:45 - 72:50)
because it does get you to check the app (72:47 - 72:54)
um right did you Hannah doesn&#39;t sound (72:50 - 72:56)
like you&#39;re doing the the the premium (72:54 - 72:58)
pass (72:56 - 73:01)
no Bobby I&#39;m sure instantly signed up (72:58 - 73:03)
instant that the first thing that I did (73:01 - 73:05)
before I did anything else I was let me (73:03 - 73:08)
get the premium pass and start that so (73:05 - 73:11)
that I got everything there is speaking (73:08 - 73:13)
of promo cards I don&#39;t know if you have (73:11 - 73:17)
to be premium but there&#39;s a Pikachu (73:13 - 73:19)
promo as well and I believe it costs (73:17 - 73:22)
like One Premium ticket so I think you (73:19 - 73:24)
have to premium pass but you can go into (73:22 - 73:26)
the shop or whatever and there&#39;s a (73:24 - 73:28)
there&#39;s like a full art illustration (73:26 - 73:31)
Pikachu in there too yeah if you if (73:28 - 73:33)
you&#39;re the offense of spending money in (73:31 - 73:34)
this (73:33 - 73:37)
game (73:34 - 73:40)
um what I would recommend is if you&#39;re (73:37 - 73:43)
going to give this game up to $10 a (73:40 - 73:45)
month or if you&#39;re just thinking about (73:43 - 73:47)
giving it $10 I think the premium pass (73:45 - 73:51)
is where you spend your money $10 like I (73:47 - 73:53)
said earlier gets you about nine booster (73:51 - 73:55)
packs again realistically you have to (73:53 - 73:58)
$12 to get 10 booster packs uh whereas (73:55 - 74:02)
if you got the premium pass you would (73:58 - 74:04)
get one extra booster pack a day for 30 (74:02 - 74:06)
days so it&#39;s it do you want to spend $10 (74:04 - 74:08)
to get 30 booster packs or do you want (74:06 - 74:12)
to spend $12 to get 10 right um so it it (74:08 - 74:14)
is worth it if you are thinking of (74:12 - 74:16)
spending any money obviously if you&#39;re (74:14 - 74:17)
free to play Stay free to play that&#39;s (74:16 - 74:19)
totally I&#39;m not trying to convince you (74:17 - 74:21)
I&#39;m just trying to tell you where your (74:19 - 74:23)
money is best (74:21 - 74:27)
going um you also so I will convince you (74:23 - 74:30)
uh premium pass you get the first two (74:27 - 74:32)
weeks for free it&#39;s a it&#39;s a two-e trial (74:30 - 74:35)
so you can use the premium pass just to (74:32 - 74:38)
try it out and then you can cancel it (74:35 - 74:40)
and not pay anything but it is a it is a (74:38 - 74:43)
two-e trial I don&#39;t think I actually I (74:40 - 74:44)
didn&#39;t actually realize that because I (74:43 - 74:46)
didn&#39;t even go and look at the premium (74:44 - 74:48)
pass because I wasn&#39;t intending to spend (74:46 - 74:52)
money very good to know it is um and so (74:48 - 74:53)
I don&#39;t know about Android but like for (74:52 - 74:56)
iOS when you go to sign up it will show (74:53 - 74:58)
you you know here&#39;s the date you signed (74:56 - 75:01)
up you won&#39;t be charge your $9.99 until (74:58 - 75:03)
you know 14 days from now and then I&#39;m (75:01 - 75:05)
sure you I&#39;m curious if it&#39;s one of the (75:03 - 75:07)
ones you can cancel right away some of (75:05 - 75:09)
them you can I think I think you can (75:07 - 75:11)
cancel it right away I think you can (75:09 - 75:16)
yeah nice so um I will say once trading (75:11 - 75:19)
is added to this game I may actually (75:16 - 75:22)
become someone who&#39;s willing to maybe (75:19 - 75:24)
buy the premium or at least put some (75:22 - 75:26)
money into this game because like being (75:24 - 75:28)
able to do things for people and make (75:26 - 75:30)
people happy with cards they like and so (75:28 - 75:32)
being able to have more cards that I (75:30 - 75:34)
could trade to friends I think is (75:32 - 75:36)
something that I would potentially be (75:34 - 75:39)
interested in but as the game is (75:36 - 75:42)
now not for me I&#39;ll stay free to play (75:39 - 75:46)
for now not for you and just to confirm (75:42 - 75:48)
yeah you can go in at least on iOS you (75:46 - 75:49)
can go into the App Store and your (75:48 - 75:51)
subscriptions you can cancel the free (75:49 - 75:53)
trial and it does say that you&#39;ll still (75:51 - 75:56)
have access to the subscription until (75:53 - 75:58)
the end of your 14 days wonderful but (75:56 - 76:02)
you can cancel it right in the App Store (75:58 - 76:02)
there so yeah (76:02 - 76:08)
there there&#39;s like a lot of neat things (76:05 - 76:11)
about it like completing certain sets or (76:08 - 76:13)
like how they put different sets (76:11 - 76:16)
together yeah um what I mean by sets is (76:13 - 76:18)
like little like just collections (76:16 - 76:21)
subsets yeah yeah like I noticed today (76:18 - 76:23)
it was a it was like you completed the (76:21 - 76:26)
Safari Zone subset and I was like huh (76:23 - 76:27)
and I went and looked and then it showed (76:26 - 76:28)
me like 11 cards that they had made up (76:27 - 76:30)
this little subset that was the Safari (76:28 - 76:33)
Zone subset and I was like that&#39;s a (76:30 - 76:35)
really nice touch like that&#39;s cool to (76:33 - 76:37)
see to then see them all together and (76:35 - 76:40)
see that that&#39;s like some little I love (76:37 - 76:43)
collecting things so you know it&#39;s like (76:40 - 76:45)
it works really well for how I like (76:43 - 76:47)
to there there are some like secret (76:45 - 76:49)
things you can do like if you got like (76:47 - 76:52)
three of the yarn electrodes you can (76:49 - 76:56)
unlock the electrode profile pick m M um (76:52 - 76:58)
so there there&#39;s like a bunch of like (76:56 - 77:00)
little stuff I don&#39;t know how that would (76:58 - 77:02)
affect when there&#39;s so many questions (77:00 - 77:06)
when trading comes of like if I only had (77:02 - 77:08)
two electrodes and Hannah trades me a a (77:06 - 77:10)
third electrode does that unlock it or (77:08 - 77:12)
do do I have to pull it okay so one (77:10 - 77:14)
thing that&#39;s interesting someone brought (77:12 - 77:16)
this up today in the slack it just may (77:14 - 77:18)
may go along with this is that they&#39;re (77:16 - 77:20)
pretty uh exact about how they want you (77:18 - 77:23)
to complete missions so I think somebody (77:20 - 77:25)
was saying that in one of like the (77:23 - 77:30)
master rank battles you have to beat it (77:25 - 77:33)
with like the three Diamond (77:30 - 77:35)
Dragonite and or like two of like (77:33 - 77:37)
something like it was like you had to be (77:35 - 77:38)
with the three diamond or two of The (77:37 - 77:39)
Three diamond ones or something and they (77:38 - 77:41)
had a three Diamond Dragonite and they (77:39 - 77:43)
had like a two Diamond Dragonite which (77:41 - 77:45)
functionally they&#39;re the same card like (77:43 - 77:48)
the move is the same the HP is the same (77:45 - 77:50)
all the stuff is the same but because (77:48 - 77:52)
one of them wasn&#39;t the three Diamond (77:50 - 77:54)
Dragonite they didn&#39;t complete the (77:52 - 77:55)
mission right so I think think that (77:54 - 77:58)
they&#39;ll be very precise on their wording (77:55 - 78:00)
of how you complete a mission it might (77:58 - 78:04)
be like you know open three of these (78:00 - 78:07)
versus like obtain three right so it&#39;s (78:04 - 78:08)
like oh this way I have to open three (78:07 - 78:10)
rather than like get one in a trade I I (78:08 - 78:13)
could see them having just the the (78:10 - 78:16)
precise wording on those missions when I (78:13 - 78:18)
did the special Lapras mission that is (78:16 - 78:21)
not in the game right now uh one of them (78:18 - 78:24)
was defeat the Lapras deck so like right (78:21 - 78:27)
now I I I completed all the like the (78:24 - 78:28)
beginner and then I think I completed (78:27 - 78:30)
all the novice which is like all of (78:28 - 78:33)
those missions plus all the the mini (78:30 - 78:35)
tasks which I think is really like neat (78:33 - 78:37)
it gives like a replayability of like I (78:35 - 78:39)
was stuck on one where I kept beating it (78:37 - 78:40)
in 15 turns and it was like beat it in (78:39 - 78:43)
14 turns and it was like I&#39;m I&#39;m one (78:40 - 78:45)
turn away every time like I&#39;m still (78:43 - 78:47)
winning it&#39;s just like I need to win one (78:45 - 78:50)
turn sooner uh so like super neat like (78:47 - 78:54)
love it um but when I was doing the (78:50 - 78:55)
Lapras ones and it was getting hard hard (78:54 - 78:57)
and harder and harder one of them was (78:55 - 78:58)
like beat this Lapras deck without using (78:57 - 79:01)
any EX Pokemon and it was like uh beat (78:58 - 79:03)
this deck without Lapras knocking you (79:01 - 79:06)
out at all uh and then I saw one of them (79:03 - 79:08)
which I don&#39;t remember if it was Lapras (79:06 - 79:10)
or something else where it was like win (79:08 - 79:12)
without taking any (79:10 - 79:15)
damage what um (79:12 - 79:17)
wow (79:15 - 79:20)
so like I think those missions are (79:17 - 79:23)
really cool and I think that they will (79:20 - 79:27)
help people get better at the TCG or at (79:23 - 79:29)
least like think of it differently like (79:27 - 79:32)
yeah I can win this match over and over (79:29 - 79:34)
and over again but it&#39;s asking me to win (79:32 - 79:37)
this match faster and now I have to (79:34 - 79:41)
adjust how I approach this like oh I&#39;m (79:37 - 79:42)
I&#39;m winning consistently I&#39;m just not (79:41 - 79:44)
doing enough damage so I have to like (79:42 - 79:46)
take these Pokemon out they&#39;re a little (79:44 - 79:47)
slower and try to risk it with a little (79:46 - 79:50)
bit harder hitters that take a little (79:47 - 79:52)
bit longer to set up um I think that (79:50 - 79:56)
stuff is really neat and you can think (79:52 - 80:00)
of it more as like a puzzle game than um (79:56 - 80:02)
like a TCG match almost of like how can (80:00 - 80:05)
I solve this puzzle uh and the Auto (80:02 - 80:07)
Battle I don&#39;t know how good it is I (80:05 - 80:09)
don&#39;t know how good it will be later on (80:07 - 80:12)
but it&#39;s like really good for all that (80:09 - 80:14)
intro stuff and it&#39;s really good if (80:12 - 80:15)
you&#39;re it&#39;s just like if your daily task (80:14 - 80:17)
is like play one match you just like (80:15 - 80:19)
okay I&#39;ll just Auto Battle and not worry (80:17 - 80:22)
about it yeah I really like that (80:19 - 80:25)
honestly it may make me build more decks (80:22 - 80:27)
because sometimes I just want to build a (80:25 - 80:29)
deck but not have to go through the (80:27 - 80:32)
experience of using it (80:29 - 80:35)
myself and so the Auto Battle may (80:32 - 80:37)
actually help with that that&#39;s like that (80:35 - 80:40)
reminds me of like Pokemon Quest you (80:37 - 80:41)
like you build out your little three (80:40 - 80:43)
person your three Pokemon Team Quest is (80:41 - 80:45)
so good and then you could like have it (80:43 - 80:47)
just Auto Battle so I&#39;d build out my (80:45 - 80:48)
team because that was the part I like (80:47 - 80:50)
the most about Quest is like building (80:48 - 80:52)
out that team and getting right attacks (80:50 - 80:55)
and everything and then just Auto Battle (80:52 - 80:57)
let set my phone up there Auto Battle go (80:55 - 80:59)
do my thing and then come back and do (80:57 - 81:02)
the next Quest you know so yeah uh other (80:59 - 81:05)
thing about premium is so premium you (81:02 - 81:08)
get three booster packs a day so how the (81:05 - 81:09)
current booster packs work this even (81:08 - 81:11)
works with premium so this is for people (81:09 - 81:13)
who don&#39;t have premium maybe don&#39;t (81:11 - 81:14)
understand how it works you&#39;ll see a (81:13 - 81:17)
timer up there and it will say uh you (81:14 - 81:20)
have 11 hours till your booster pack and (81:17 - 81:22)
once that 11 hours is there you get that (81:20 - 81:24)
booster pack and then the second timer (81:22 - 81:26)
starts ticker ticking of like 12 hours (81:24 - 81:29)
for the next one so you can hold as a (81:26 - 81:31)
free player two booster packs and then (81:29 - 81:33)
once you get that second booster pack no (81:31 - 81:36)
more timers exist you have to open one (81:33 - 81:39)
of them to start the next (81:36 - 81:40)
timer and (81:39 - 81:43)
then obviously the next one is 12 hours (81:40 - 81:46)
later how the how the paid works is you (81:43 - 81:49)
get a separate track and that one is (81:46 - 81:54)
every 24 hours MH and so that doesn&#39;t (81:49 - 81:55)
affect (81:54 - 81:58)
your two free ones it&#39;s on a whole (81:55 - 82:01)
different timer you can hold two of (81:58 - 82:05)
those packs so if you don&#39;t play the (82:01 - 82:09)
game for like 48 Hours you will have (82:05 - 82:10)
four booster packs you will have your (82:09 - 82:13)
two free ones and then your paid one can (82:10 - 82:17)
hold an extra one in reserve um do I (82:13 - 82:20)
recommend that uh sometimes life gets (82:17 - 82:24)
busy but like don&#39;t feel like like every (82:20 - 82:28)
night at 10 p.m. I need to open my my (82:24 - 82:29)
premium one because otherwise it won&#39;t (82:28 - 82:32)
start the track it will start uh it will (82:29 - 82:33)
start a track (82:32 - 82:36)
so you don&#39;t have to like it doesn&#39;t (82:33 - 82:38)
feel like a full-time job because you (82:36 - 82:40)
paid for premium of like oh my gosh I (82:38 - 82:43)
need to open this app exactly 10 o&#39;clock (82:40 - 82:46)
every night take my medication brush my (82:43 - 82:49)
teeth turn on my Pokeball plus yeah not (82:46 - 82:50)
like Pokemon sleep asking you to open it (82:49 - 82:52)
for breakfast lunch and dinner although (82:50 - 82:56)
I will say Pokemon TCG pocket has a very (82:52 - 82:59)
good notification sound mhm that is very (82:56 - 83:02)
clearly Pokemon that I had never heard (82:59 - 83:04)
it before and I heard it go off one time (83:02 - 83:06)
and my brain went yep that&#39;s that&#39;s (83:04 - 83:08)
Pokemon I know what that is just based (83:06 - 83:12)
off the sound yeah speaking of sounds (83:08 - 83:15)
the music in dcg Pocket is it&#39;s good as (83:12 - 83:18)
well it&#39;s not Pokemon sleep levels good (83:15 - 83:22)
but it is uh it&#39;s enjoyable I I do like (83:18 - 83:25)
uh I hadn&#39;t listened with the with the (83:22 - 83:27)
sound on at first and then I think I had (83:25 - 83:28)
my headphones on or something and I (83:27 - 83:30)
opened the app and the music came on and (83:28 - 83:33)
I was like oh this is this is kind of (83:30 - 83:35)
nice this is is nice nice music and uh (83:33 - 83:38)
nice sound (83:35 - 83:38)
effects yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s (83:38 - 83:42)
good it&#39;s (83:41 - 83:46)
[Laughter] (83:42 - 83:50)
great I (83:46 - 83:50)
uh I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s like fully worth (83:50 - 83:56)
putting a bunch of money (83:54 - 83:58)
in like as as somebody who was given (83:56 - 84:01)
$100 which I disclosed uh I bought the (83:58 - 84:03)
Erica (84:01 - 84:07)
set um which was with coins so that gave (84:03 - 84:09)
me the playmat and then the sleeves and (84:07 - 84:11)
then the the rainbow (84:09 - 84:15)
coin and then if I do want (84:11 - 84:17)
to I think it&#39;s the gavor set where you (84:15 - 84:21)
can&#39;t buy it with gold but you buy it (84:17 - 84:24)
with money but you get gold yes and then (84:21 - 84:27)
there&#39;s $22 or (84:24 - 84:31)
$23 uh USD but you get like $25 worth of (84:27 - 84:32)
gold (84:31 - 84:35)
plus yeah you get a bunch of gold um you (84:32 - 84:37)
get gold and then yeah and you get the (84:35 - 84:38)
gardav (84:37 - 84:42)
war um set and then there&#39;s uh there&#39;s (84:38 - 84:44)
like the three special offers of like 99 (84:42 - 84:47)
Cents $4.99 and then I think $9.99 which (84:44 - 84:48)
gives you bonus stuff I don&#39;t think (84:47 - 84:50)
those have end dates I don&#39;t know if (84:48 - 84:52)
those are just Forever Until you (84:50 - 84:54)
eventually buy them yeah I don&#39;t know if (84:52 - 84:55)
there&#39;s any (84:54 - 84:57)
away when you buy them yeah ideally you (84:55 - 85:01)
buy those first um yes (84:57 - 85:04)
so yeah I I&#39;ve I&#39;ve opened more than a (85:01 - 85:06)
100 packs I think because I think the (85:04 - 85:09)
game tells you you&#39;ve opened 100 packs (85:06 - 85:12)
but you get so many free packs like the (85:09 - 85:13)
first like day you play it because it&#39;s (85:12 - 85:16)
just like checking off missions and (85:13 - 85:19)
stuff yeah uh so it it it makes sense to (85:16 - 85:23)
me like somebody who would get this game (85:19 - 85:25)
live in this game for like two to three (85:23 - 85:28)
hours have such a good time and then all (85:25 - 85:31)
of a sudden go well there&#39;s nothing to (85:28 - 85:35)
do yep well and it&#39;s just you&#39;re not (85:31 - 85:37)
opening packs consistently anymore maybe (85:35 - 85:39)
you&#39;re maybe you&#39;ve done all the AI (85:37 - 85:40)
battles and you&#39;re not like interested (85:39 - 85:43)
in those anymore like I totally get it (85:40 - 85:46)
um but like what the other content they (85:43 - 85:48)
can add is like the Wonder pick stuff (85:46 - 85:50)
which isn&#39;t a lot to do it does get you (85:48 - 85:53)
to open the the app more frequently um (85:50 - 85:55)
but even that&#39;s like gated (85:53 - 85:57)
uh with time and then they can add like (85:55 - 86:00)
that Lapras event and another event (85:57 - 86:02)
after that but that stuff goes back to (86:00 - 86:06)
battling so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know how (86:02 - 86:09)
that is different than any other game (86:06 - 86:11)
though I mean like no I Pokemon sleep (86:09 - 86:15)
yeah I like feed Snorlax I uh you know (86:11 - 86:18)
go in and overthink what teams or what I (86:15 - 86:20)
need to you know power up or do whatever (86:18 - 86:22)
with and then there&#39;s nothing else to do (86:20 - 86:25)
for now I close the app and I go on into (86:22 - 86:28)
my day you know I I (86:25 - 86:31)
that&#39;s I think why I like it right (86:28 - 86:32)
that&#39;s the that&#39;s the thing it&#39;s like (86:31 - 86:33)
I&#39;m not sitting in it for I don&#39;t want (86:32 - 86:36)
to sit in it for six hours yeah I want (86:33 - 86:37)
to you know that&#39;s what Pokemon go is (86:36 - 86:40)
for I&#39;ll go out and take a giant walk (86:37 - 86:43)
but like I I like the fact that I can go (86:40 - 86:46)
complete tasks uh do a couple battles if (86:43 - 86:49)
I want to do a couple battles uh I could (86:46 - 86:50)
you know spend money and open more packs (86:49 - 86:53)
if I want to or not uh and then I can (86:50 - 86:55)
close the app and (86:53 - 86:57)
you know move on to the (86:55 - 87:01)
day yeah I think I had this I had this (86:57 - 87:04)
with unite I have this with a lot of (87:01 - 87:08)
games uh whether this is like uh Apex (87:04 - 87:11)
Legends or Pokemon unite or or whatever (87:08 - 87:15)
where like I want everything ironically (87:11 - 87:16)
I really like Pokemon games where it&#39;s (87:15 - 87:20)
like I want to catch everything right I (87:16 - 87:22)
I have a very collector&#39;s mindset I (87:20 - 87:23)
think people who listen to the show (87:22 - 87:26)
probably can relate they play Pokemon (87:23 - 87:27)
they probably have a collector&#39;s mindset (87:26 - 87:32)
as well with Pokemon unite it was pretty (87:27 - 87:34)
quickly broken also with Apex Legend it (87:32 - 87:35)
was pretty quickly broken because it was (87:34 - 87:37)
like I don&#39;t care about these characters (87:35 - 87:39)
these Skins are too expensive this (87:37 - 87:40)
applies to both of these games Pokemon (87:39 - 87:42)
unite in Apex Legends where it&#39;s like (87:40 - 87:44)
I&#39;m never going to play this character I (87:42 - 87:46)
don&#39;t want to pay $20 for a skin I think (87:44 - 87:47)
in Pokemon unite some of the Skins are (87:46 - 87:50)
like $40 yeah I&#39;m never going to play (87:47 - 87:52)
Ninetales I&#39;m not going to pay $40 for a (87:50 - 87:54)
skin and at at a certain point it just (87:52 - 87:57)
breaks that for me where it&#39;s like I&#39;m (87:54 - 87:59)
never going to get everything in the (87:57 - 88:02)
game now I&#39;ve met people who play Apex (87:59 - 88:05)
Legends or play Pokemon unite that own (88:02 - 88:08)
every single character every single skin (88:05 - 88:12)
every single like special seasonal (88:08 - 88:12)
event that&#39;s awesome I don&#39;t have that (88:13 - 88:18)
kind of money even if I did have that (88:16 - 88:19)
kind of money I don&#39;t know if I would (88:18 - 88:22)
give it to unite or give it to respawn (88:19 - 88:26)
over at for Apex Legends uh and I I had (88:22 - 88:27)
that feeling (88:26 - 88:30)
today uh with pocket so obviously (88:27 - 88:32)
Pokemon gave me a hundred bucks I was (88:30 - 88:35)
like dang that&#39;s cool cool I I can guilt (88:32 - 88:38)
free spend it but even when I was like (88:35 - 88:40)
looking at the Erica (88:38 - 88:43)
stuff I was like I don&#39;t care about a (88:40 - 88:45)
binder cover I don&#39;t care about like the (88:43 - 88:48)
little placeholder card and when am I (88:45 - 88:51)
ever going to use the green coin when I (88:48 - 88:53)
bought the rainbow coin which looks (88:51 - 88:55)
significant like I&#39;m never going to (88:53 - 88:59)
equip this green coin ever um and I (88:55 - 89:04)
think what also helped trigger that was (88:59 - 89:07)
I think the Erica playmat is gorgeous I (89:04 - 89:09)
think it&#39;s such a cool playmat I love (89:07 - 89:12)
her card sleeves when I switched to the (89:09 - 89:14)
Eevee playmat I was like I don&#39;t like (89:12 - 89:16)
this I think it&#39;s too busy it&#39;s super (89:14 - 89:20)
busy and it&#39;s kind of hard to look at (89:16 - 89:23)
um and it really broke it for me to be (89:20 - 89:25)
like you know what (89:23 - 89:28)
because I think the I think the (89:25 - 89:30)
Erica binder cover green coin and (89:28 - 89:32)
whatever I think if you do the gold math (89:30 - 89:36)
it&#39;s like $10 it&#39;s like $9 or50 or $10 I (89:32 - 89:40)
was like that&#39;s just $10 I don&#39;t need to (89:36 - 89:43)
spend and I think and even with the (89:40 - 89:45)
gardav war thing I&#39;m thinking I don&#39;t (89:43 - 89:48)
love gavor I think I think I think he&#39;s (89:45 - 89:50)
a good good Pokemon I&#39;m saying he cuz (89:48 - 89:53)
gavor is a 50% male 50% female I think (89:50 - 89:57)
gavor I think he&#39;s fantastic (89:53 - 90:00)
um but I don&#39;t think I would use that (89:57 - 90:03)
playmat more than like the Erica playmat (90:00 - 90:06)
right now and I think that&#39;s like a good (90:03 - 90:08)
problem to have because I can easily see (90:06 - 90:10)
somebody just like in unite or somebody (90:08 - 90:12)
in Apex legends that that has that (90:10 - 90:14)
mindset of like I need everything I need (90:12 - 90:17)
both Erica sets I need the gavor I need (90:14 - 90:19)
the Mewtwo I need the meow set whenever (90:17 - 90:21)
that comes out I need the Lapras set (90:19 - 90:23)
whenever that comes (90:21 - 90:25)
out and (90:23 - 90:27)
I just don&#39;t (90:25 - 90:29)
feel like I need to give that money that (90:27 - 90:31)
way I I think it&#39;s cool I think it&#39;s (90:29 - 90:32)
very cool to have options where you can (90:31 - 90:35)
be like I love Ninetails I&#39;m definitely (90:32 - 90:37)
going to buy the $40 ninetail skin I (90:35 - 90:38)
don&#39;t like karant I have no desire to (90:37 - 90:41)
spend the $40 karant skin I think that&#39;s (90:38 - 90:44)
great to have options um but I I&#39;m glad (90:41 - 90:46)
that at least for me it feels like I&#39;ve (90:44 - 90:50)
already broke that uh want to have (90:46 - 90:53)
everything in this game yeah (90:50 - 90:55)
cosmetically broke it right nice and (90:53 - 90:57)
early (90:55 - 91:00)
yeah because right now like I I think (90:57 - 91:02)
it&#39;s easy to to to commit to that very (91:00 - 91:05)
early on of like oh there&#39;s only like (91:02 - 91:06)
three things to buy it&#39;s only the gardav (91:05 - 91:09)
war the Erica and the Erica and so like (91:06 - 91:12)
I own it all like you can like slowly (91:09 - 91:14)
work up to like the Mewtwo playmat or (91:12 - 91:16)
whatever in the in the shop but (91:14 - 91:18)
obviously I know as the game goes on (91:16 - 91:20)
it&#39;s going to be like it&#39;s just going to (91:18 - 91:23)
add up yep so like why am I going to (91:20 - 91:25)
spend $10 on (91:23 - 91:26)
like the game&#39;s been out for a couple (91:25 - 91:28)
days and it&#39;s like I really don&#39;t care (91:26 - 91:30)
about the display thing and I really (91:28 - 91:32)
don&#39;t care about binder covers right (91:30 - 91:36)
now maybe I will I don&#39;t think so but I (91:32 - 91:40)
really like the playmats I (91:36 - 91:42)
think plays and coins are are up there (91:40 - 91:48)
for me but yeah I think that there just (91:42 - 91:50)
isn&#39;t enough and this is okay like (91:48 - 91:52)
there&#39;s not there&#39;s not a lot of variety (91:50 - 91:55)
yet so it&#39;s like yeah you&#39;re not like (91:52 - 91:57)
into the binder covers there could be a (91:55 - 91:59)
time when it&#39;s like karant month and (91:57 - 92:01)
you&#39;re like oh you know what I would (91:59 - 92:03)
like to have like a like theme of like (92:01 - 92:05)
you go to my profile you look at my (92:03 - 92:07)
stuff it&#39;s all crar an themed right and (92:05 - 92:09)
like that may be something that gets you (92:07 - 92:12)
to buy a crar binder cover or a cramar (92:09 - 92:14)
display at that point in time but you (92:12 - 92:17)
know I think it&#39;s I think that&#39;s okay (92:14 - 92:20)
and I think that I I like all the (92:17 - 92:25)
options that they have and it just I (92:20 - 92:26)
don&#39;t know when I look at it and we&#39;re (92:25 - 92:27)
just different how we think like I (92:26 - 92:30)
definitely don&#39;t look at it like oh I (92:27 - 92:32)
need to get that that and the other it&#39;s (92:30 - 92:34)
more like oh well do I like that yeah I (92:32 - 92:36)
like that I&#39;m gonna be looking at that (92:34 - 92:38)
so I want to make sure that like I like (92:36 - 92:41)
it I&#39;m not going to go buy every playmat (92:38 - 92:42)
because I&#39;m not going to use every (92:41 - 92:45)
playmat just realistically you know um (92:42 - 92:48)
yeah but it&#39;s you know I think that if (92:45 - 92:49)
you (92:48 - 92:52)
are a person who likes to collect (92:49 - 92:55)
everything uh that&#39;s great it&#39;s there (92:52 - 92:57)
for you and then if you&#39;re just want to (92:55 - 92:59)
like choose what you like then it&#39;s (92:57 - 93:00)
perfect because there are so many (92:59 - 93:01)
different (93:00 - 93:03)
options and if you just want to do the (93:01 - 93:05)
collecting but well on free to play you (93:03 - 93:07)
have plenty of cards to collect without (93:05 - 93:10)
having to worry about the accessories (93:07 - 93:13)
yeah though I do hope to see more of the (93:10 - 93:14)
accessories and things like that because (93:13 - 93:17)
I if there&#39;s one I like I think it would (93:14 - 93:19)
be neat I think they&#39;re oh once there&#39;s (93:17 - 93:21)
a ra accessory Hannah&#39;s all (93:19 - 93:26)
in $22 down the for that that rainbow ra (93:21 - 93:30)
coin very possibly (93:26 - 93:34)
yep um did they ever say I can&#39;t (93:30 - 93:38)
remember if they answered uh how often (93:34 - 93:40)
new sets would come out yeah we asked (93:38 - 93:43)
them that question and they said (93:40 - 93:45)
genuinely we don&#39;t have a road map for (93:43 - 93:47)
that they said we we have we are working (93:45 - 93:50)
on new sets but we don&#39;t want to release (93:47 - 93:52)
them too soon or too late so they were (93:50 - 93:54)
like we&#39;re just waiting until the comes (93:52 - 93:56)
out we&#39;re seeing how fast people get (93:54 - 93:57)
through (93:56 - 94:02)
sets Okay which I think is a good answer (93:57 - 94:04)
yeah I think it is too it&#39;s it&#39;s (94:02 - 94:06)
interesting (94:04 - 94:11)
because unlike a company where so like (94:06 - 94:15)
because all the cards are actually drawn (94:11 - 94:18)
by TCG artists right like you&#39;ll see (94:15 - 94:21)
artists that are like that draw cards (94:18 - 94:22)
the real card like the physical cards as (94:21 - 94:26)
well and so I just wonder like if (94:22 - 94:29)
they&#39;re like not sure how they&#39;re going (94:26 - 94:30)
to like how they&#39;re going to do that (94:29 - 94:31)
like I wonder if they have I wonder if (94:30 - 94:34)
they have a few sets already like set up (94:31 - 94:37)
that they&#39;ll drop at some point just (94:34 - 94:39)
because I would imagine those all those (94:37 - 94:42)
artists are doing the work to draw those (94:39 - 94:44)
cards and so they (94:42 - 94:46)
must be there (94:44 - 94:48)
somewhere yeah also they&#39;re pulling from (94:46 - 94:50)
old cards too right they definitely are (94:48 - 94:52)
some stuff some stuff is yeah there&#39;s (94:50 - 94:53)
definitely but there are a lot of cards (94:52 - 94:57)
that I look at them and it&#39;s like why (94:53 - 94:58)
aren&#39;t you why can&#39;t you be a physical (94:57 - 95:01)
card yeah artwork is (94:58 - 95:04)
beautiful uh the other thing I think the (95:01 - 95:06)
last thing I&#39;ll say I don&#39;t know if you (95:04 - 95:08)
guys have anything else is I know that (95:06 - 95:11)
some people play with no sound on I (95:08 - 95:14)
totally understand I get if you pull an (95:11 - 95:16)
immersive card turn your sound on (95:14 - 95:19)
there&#39;s four immersive cards in the game (95:16 - 95:21)
Charizard Mewtwo Pikachu and there&#39;s a (95:19 - 95:22)
secret one I don&#39;t want to spoil it for (95:21 - 95:25)
people um each one of those immersive (95:22 - 95:28)
cards not only are they like really cool (95:25 - 95:29)
the ones you like dive into and like the (95:28 - 95:32)
card expands they all have their own (95:29 - 95:36)
music track to it and it&#39;s it blows (95:32 - 95:39)
Pokemon sleep away the music is so good (95:36 - 95:40)
per (95:39 - 95:43)
card it&#39;s just a really nice touch on (95:40 - 95:45)
top of like obviously they&#39;re working (95:43 - 95:47)
with all these artists to make these (95:45 - 95:49)
cards but they must be working with (95:47 - 95:52)
specific composers to like make a a (95:49 - 95:54)
melody and I&#39;m not a music person I (95:52 - 95:58)
don&#39;t know a Melody a tune a song to the (95:54 - 96:02)
card itself yeah that&#39;s so cool yeah (95:58 - 96:04)
they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re great they&#39;re (96:02 - 96:05)
great you can also just replay it like (96:04 - 96:07)
if you miss it or like you already (96:05 - 96:08)
opened a Mewtwo and you&#39;re like oh I (96:07 - 96:10)
didn&#39;t know there was sound to it you (96:08 - 96:12)
can just go back to the card and tap and (96:10 - 96:15)
hold and it will like bring you into it (96:12 - 96:17)
again and just turn your sound up it&#39;s (96:15 - 96:20)
they&#39;re they&#39;re all super (96:17 - 96:24)
cool yeah that&#39;s definitely uh it yeah (96:20 - 96:27)
that&#39;s pretty awesome uh there&#39;s um also (96:24 - 96:31)
in the settings of the app uh there is (96:27 - 96:33)
you can have it be 30 frames per second (96:31 - 96:36)
or 60 frames per second so is it default (96:33 - 96:40)
30 I think the I don&#39;t remember changing (96:36 - 96:41)
it and when I went and looked today it (96:40 - 96:45)
was 60 on my app so but then there&#39;s (96:41 - 96:49)
also uh three settings that are one is (96:45 - 96:51)
high performance one is balanced and (96:49 - 96:54)
then one is high quality (96:51 - 96:57)
and I was going through I didn&#39;t see a (96:54 - 96:59)
huge difference like I did high (96:57 - 97:01)
performance versus high quality and like (96:59 - 97:04)
just looking at like a card I didn&#39;t see (97:01 - 97:05)
any difference but I didn&#39;t do I haven&#39;t (97:04 - 97:07)
had a chance to do like a match and (97:05 - 97:10)
stuff and see what the difference is (97:07 - 97:12)
when they&#39;re set between the three (97:10 - 97:14)
different settings but those are in (97:12 - 97:17)
there so um you can kind of go into your (97:14 - 97:19)
settings and and and mess with a couple (97:17 - 97:23)
of things there as well (97:19 - 97:23)
uh anything (97:24 - 97:27)
else it&#39;s a great app I I don&#39;t know (97:27 - 97:32)
it&#39;s it&#39;s wonderful I love it it&#39;s (97:30 - 97:33)
everything that I expect that I was (97:32 - 97:35)
hoping it would be like and when you (97:33 - 97:38)
explained it a couple months ago to us (97:35 - 97:42)
uh I it was you know I was surprised (97:38 - 97:43)
right at the time we were like whoa (97:42 - 97:46)
Steve really likes this app this sounds (97:43 - 97:49)
really good uh you know and then New (97:46 - 97:51)
Zealand I like that people that listen (97:49 - 97:53)
to The Show for a long time know that (97:51 - 97:54)
I&#39;m historically negative so that&#39;s why (97:53 - 97:56)
I thought it was so funny last week when (97:54 - 97:58)
I was positive on the ghost Stu people (97:56 - 98:02)
were like Ah that&#39;s what same cuz I&#39;m (97:58 - 98:03)
like do the people who say that you&#39;re a (98:02 - 98:05)
shill last week not ever listen to any (98:03 - 98:07)
other episode of this show cuz where I&#39;m (98:05 - 98:09)
like so critical like Niantic literally (98:07 - 98:12)
sent me to Jakarta and I was like yeah (98:09 - 98:14)
the Pokemon Go stuff kind of sucked but (98:12 - 98:16)
everything else was (98:14 - 98:21)
good yeah um but you really liked this (98:16 - 98:23)
game when you played it and we were all (98:21 - 98:26)
surprised and I think the community at (98:23 - 98:29)
large was surprised and uh and then when (98:26 - 98:31)
it came out in New Zealand for like the (98:29 - 98:34)
early release you know like we were (98:31 - 98:36)
saying when we said that before it&#39;s (98:34 - 98:37)
like usually they do that kind of thing (98:36 - 98:39)
because they&#39;re worried like it&#39;s not (98:37 - 98:41)
going to be good or we&#39;ve seen like in (98:39 - 98:42)
the past where like they&#39;ve released (98:41 - 98:44)
something early and it&#39;s not good and (98:42 - 98:46)
there was there was no comments about (98:44 - 98:48)
that right in that month it was seemed (98:46 - 98:49)
like people were just having a good time (98:48 - 98:53)
with it and so that tracks I don&#39;t know (98:49 - 98:54)
like I it&#39;s (98:53 - 98:56)
yeah I still don&#39;t really understand why (98:54 - 98:59)
they did the early release but we can (98:56 - 99:01)
all play it now so yeah it&#39;s not like (98:59 - 99:03)
they did any like card balances or (99:01 - 99:06)
anything yeah no and the people who who (99:03 - 99:07)
were able to do the early release and (99:06 - 99:10)
spent money luckily didn&#39;t get anything (99:07 - 99:12)
reset so they didn&#39;t like lose yeah lose (99:10 - 99:14)
the cards that they had pulled or lose (99:12 - 99:15)
the money that they had spent or (99:14 - 99:17)
anything like that which was obviously (99:15 - 99:20)
the right move since people spent (99:17 - 99:23)
money yeah I think I think as like a a a (99:20 - 99:25)
game that you can spend money in I don&#39;t (99:23 - 99:28)
think it&#39;s unreasonable I don&#39;t think (99:25 - 99:31)
like 10 packs for $12 it&#39;s cheaper than (99:28 - 99:33)
I I think I said this when I initially (99:31 - 99:35)
played it because I laid out the pricing (99:33 - 99:37)
it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely cheaper than like (99:35 - 99:39)
Masters or or I feel like a lot of (99:37 - 99:41)
gotcha games in general like hongkai (99:39 - 99:45)
Star rail get an impact walking waving (99:41 - 99:47)
weathering waves whatever that other one (99:45 - 99:51)
is I almost said walking wake uh that&#39;s (99:47 - 99:54)
my walking wake is my favorite got you (99:51 - 99:57)
game love them (99:54 - 99:59)
uh I (99:57 - 100:02)
think I think this game is cheaper to (99:59 - 100:05)
like just pull on in general um it (100:02 - 100:07)
definitely cheaper than Pokemon Masters (100:05 - 100:09)
Pokemon Masters a single poll is 300 (100:07 - 100:14)
gems um and 10 poles is 3,000 (100:09 - 100:16)
gems (100:14 - 100:21)
so but the only actual complaint I&#39;ve (100:16 - 100:25)
seen is I ran out of things to do (100:21 - 100:30)
MH but it&#39;s like not the worst complaint (100:25 - 100:32)
I mean it is a Val to be (100:30 - 100:34)
all-encompassing it is a valid complaint (100:32 - 100:35)
and I&#39;m really looking forward to (100:34 - 100:39)
trading being a thing and I I think I (100:35 - 100:42)
hope ladders become a thing in the game (100:39 - 100:43)
or at least some sort of competition (100:42 - 100:45)
around the game it doesn&#39;t have to be an (100:43 - 100:47)
in-game ladder I feel like plenty of (100:45 - 100:49)
competitions could be built outside of (100:47 - 100:51)
the game as well kind of like Pokémon go (100:49 - 100:54)
did for a while um (100:51 - 100:56)
but yeah not every game has to be (100:54 - 100:59)
all-encompassing do you do you get a (100:56 - 101:02)
record like would do you even though it (100:59 - 101:03)
doesn&#39;t nothing happens to you if you (101:02 - 101:05)
lose is there a place where you can (101:03 - 101:07)
actually just see like a total of your (101:05 - 101:09)
wins and losses for any like all the (101:07 - 101:10)
matches you&#39;ve played not for the AI (101:09 - 101:13)
matches it doesn&#39;t record those yeah for (101:10 - 101:15)
the other one for the yeah if you just (101:13 - 101:17)
play a person like your friend it will (101:15 - 101:20)
under your profile picture where you can (101:17 - 101:22)
like pick your little catchphrase it&#39;ll (101:20 - 101:24)
have a button for (101:22 - 101:26)
with your win loss ratio okay got it (101:24 - 101:29)
then yes then and I don&#39;t know if like (101:26 - 101:31)
resets otherwise yeah I don&#39;t know if (101:29 - 101:32)
you&#39;d be able to do it if you didn&#39;t (101:31 - 101:35)
have a way to like see those ratios or (101:32 - 101:39)
something but um yeah I (101:35 - 101:42)
mean yeah I hope we get a ladder at some (101:39 - 101:44)
point but this right now it&#39;s like it&#39;s (101:42 - 101:47)
just fun to learn the game play the game (101:44 - 101:50)
open packs build decks and be able to do (101:47 - 101:55)
that I really do think that this can (101:50 - 102:00)
also push people into playing the TCG (101:55 - 102:03)
whether that&#39;s physical or online like I (102:00 - 102:05)
think this is a great stepping stone (102:03 - 102:08)
into that because it (102:05 - 102:13)
is so much like the TCG in a lot of ways (102:08 - 102:14)
and in ways it&#39;s in certain ways it&#39;s (102:13 - 102:17)
not obviously but I think it&#39;s a great (102:14 - 102:20)
stepping stone if people do eventually (102:17 - 102:21)
or if they&#39;re like on the fence about (102:20 - 102:23)
wanting to play the TCG or try it out (102:21 - 102:26)
it&#39;s like this is a great way to start (102:23 - 102:29)
uh I I do I will say the other complaint (102:26 - 102:30)
I have (102:29 - 102:32)
heard and I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t feel the (102:30 - 102:34)
same way but like I know people were (102:32 - 102:37)
saying that they weren&#39;t as happy with (102:34 - 102:40)
like how random things are with when it (102:37 - 102:43)
comes to the supporter cards and stuff (102:40 - 102:45)
so in order to make the game no coin (102:43 - 102:47)
flips in my (102:45 - 102:50)
decks but like in order to make the uh (102:47 - 102:52)
game quicker rather than like in the (102:50 - 102:55)
regular TCG you know if you have I Think (102:52 - 102:56)
It&#39;s Pokeball allows you to go search (102:55 - 102:59)
your deck and pull out a basic Pokemon (102:56 - 103:02)
where in this game you randomly get a (102:59 - 103:03)
basic Pokemon from your deck and it gets (103:02 - 103:05)
put into your hand right and I know some (103:03 - 103:08)
people had a little bit of not it&#39;s not (103:05 - 103:10)
really a complaint more so just like oh (103:08 - 103:12)
this is different like I&#39;d rather be (103:10 - 103:14)
able to go pick the Pokemon that I&#39;m (103:12 - 103:16)
pulling out rather than it randomly get (103:14 - 103:17)
pulled but I think that&#39;s just the (103:16 - 103:22)
nature of making it a quicker match so (103:17 - 103:24)
I&#39;m okay with that cuz like I I said the (103:22 - 103:28)
matches are a good speed for me uh but (103:24 - 103:30)
that is one other uh complaint that I (103:28 - 103:33)
heard yeah I mean it&#39;s a valid complaint (103:30 - 103:35)
I don&#39;t know if I agree with it because (103:33 - 103:40)
it&#39;s it is a different game yeah (103:35 - 103:43)
um uh I I think it&#39;s it&#39;s more people (103:40 - 103:45)
who&#39;ve like played the TCG and play it a (103:43 - 103:47)
certain way and then they come and (103:45 - 103:49)
they&#39;re like oh this is it&#39;s different (103:47 - 103:51)
more random in that way which is fine (103:49 - 103:55)
like it&#39;s understandable (103:51 - 103:55)
um yeah it&#39;s almost like like the (103:55 - 103:58)
traditional raids verus the max raid (103:57 - 104:02)
battles they&#39;re similar but they&#39;re (103:58 - 104:05)
different maybe kind of I don&#39;t know (104:02 - 104:07)
this isn&#39;t there wasn&#39;t a whole weekend (104:05 - 104:10)
of first you got get 40 people together (104:07 - 104:14)
then we all open packs at the same (104:10 - 104:14)
time (104:14 - 104:19)
uh yeah I I I really like it I&#39;m I I (104:15 - 104:22)
think that uh I think for sure it it (104:19 - 104:24)
will have legs (104:22 - 104:27)
and I&#39;m I I imagine that it will be very (104:24 - 104:29)
much like a Pokemon go situation where (104:27 - 104:31)
people will be like oh people still play (104:29 - 104:35)
that it&#39;s like yeah yep yep we we still (104:31 - 104:38)
do uh did I just open my two packs a day (104:35 - 104:41)
like very you know the bar is very low (104:38 - 104:43)
to play this game and I think that&#39;s a I (104:41 - 104:47)
think that&#39;s a good thing yeah doesn&#39;t (104:43 - 104:48)
doesn&#39;t you know speaking of games that (104:47 - 104:50)
take a lot of your time Pokemon go is (104:48 - 104:53)
one of them so it&#39;s nice to (104:50 - 104:56)
not have a game and that&#39;s cool that&#39;s (104:53 - 104:57)
like super cool for people who like (104:56 - 104:59)
Pokémon Go I mean I love Pokémon go but (104:57 - 105:01)
it&#39;s like have we had a weekend I can&#39;t (104:59 - 105:03)
even remember the last weekend where (105:01 - 105:06)
there wasn&#39;t something Pokemon go (105:03 - 105:09)
related right yeah that&#39;s it&#39;s been a (105:06 - 105:12)
while but and to your point I think (105:09 - 105:14)
that&#39;s a good thing and as someone who (105:12 - 105:17)
like was always a completionist for that (105:14 - 105:18)
stuff like I was always like oh I&#39;ve got (105:17 - 105:19)
to go do the event I&#39;ve got to make sure (105:18 - 105:21)
to get the timed research done I got to (105:19 - 105:23)
make sure to do this I think at some (105:21 - 105:25)
point I missed a couple and it was (105:23 - 105:27)
almost like a weight off my shoulders (105:25 - 105:30)
where I was like you know I love this (105:27 - 105:31)
game but if I don&#39;t want to play on (105:30 - 105:33)
Saturday and and complete that timed (105:31 - 105:35)
research that&#39;s okay there&#39;s going to be (105:33 - 105:37)
another event next weekend that I can do (105:35 - 105:39)
because they&#39;re all over the place and I (105:37 - 105:44)
I actually love Pokemon go for that yeah (105:39 - 105:46)
yeah there&#39;s uh there&#39;s always like the (105:44 - 105:48)
a week after like goest or something or (105:46 - 105:51)
it&#39;s like oh they&#39;re repeating something (105:48 - 105:52)
I&#39;m going to skip this entire week (105:51 - 105:55)
perfect yeah yeah yep like cool they (105:52 - 105:57)
repeating it for the people that missed (105:55 - 106:01)
it I didn&#39;t so I can skip yeah but (105:57 - 106:02)
unlike what&#39;s happening now where we had (106:01 - 106:04)
the Halloween event until like tomorrow (106:02 - 106:07)
and then jumping into some Harvest (106:04 - 106:10)

November I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re getting (106:35 - 106:41)
any Za news at all I think at this point (106:37 - 106:43)
we are we are pushing for Pokemon day I (106:41 - 106:46)
don&#39;t think we are getting a January Za (106:43 - 106:48)
release you know I said this earlier in (106:46 - 106:51)
the year people didn&#39;t believe me you (106:48 - 106:54)
know at this point the T the TCG lineup (106:51 - 106:56)
looked a certain way earlier this year (106:54 - 107:00)
it looks very different now so you know (106:56 - 107:03)
our opinions change it&#39;s (107:00 - 107:05)
okay yeah yeah I I think if we are (107:03 - 107:08)
getting anything Za I think it&#39;s (107:05 - 107:10)
