I am (0:00 - 0:03)
recording what&#39;s up everyone welcome to (0:14 - 0:17)
the (0:16 - 0:20)
640th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:17 - 0:22)
it&#39;s super effective there&#39;s too many of (0:20 - 0:25)
these uh I&#39;m your host Steve with me is (0:22 - 0:29)
Hannah I am here I have been doing (0:25 - 0:32)
chores since 7:30 D and not Pokemon (0:29 - 0:33)
things (0:32 - 0:36)
but yeah I caught some drifloon this (0:33 - 0:41)
week oh and sleep yes oh okay (0:36 - 0:45)
okay uh Al is also here I am I am here (0:41 - 0:47)
despite the weather trying to stop me (0:45 - 0:52)
getting here multiple times but I&#39;m (0:47 - 0:52)
here flights don&#39;t like wind apparently (0:52 - 0:58)
so yeah yeah you you were traveling (0:55 - 1:01)
today yeah yeah so I was in I was in (0:58 - 1:06)
Portugal for a a work event so my my (1:01 - 1:08)
company&#39;s fully remote and once a year (1:06 - 1:10)
we meet up somewhere and this time it (1:08 - 1:12)
was in Portugal and my CL my flight to (1:10 - 1:14)
Portugal got cancelled so I had to (1:12 - 1:16)
redirect via (1:14 - 1:18)
Ireland (1:16 - 1:20)
ah and then coming back there was a (1:18 - 1:22)
storm but thankfully we still got (1:20 - 1:25)
through all right I&#39;m here I like how (1:22 - 1:27)
like European countries are like we&#39;ll (1:25 - 1:28)
just go to a different country and (1:27 - 1:32)
America&#39;s like we go (1:28 - 1:32)
Disney I will say the funny thing about (1:33 - 1:37)
Ireland is so I went through passport (1:35 - 1:39)
control because it&#39;s an airport but (1:37 - 1:41)
technically you don&#39;t have to show a (1:39 - 1:43)
passport to get into Ireland from the UK (1:41 - 1:44)
so it was the most chill passport (1:43 - 1:46)
control ever he like asked for the (1:44 - 1:48)
passport saw it was a UK one just (1:46 - 1:49)
checked the image and was like yeah (1:48 - 1:52)
that&#39;s fine and it was like he he barely (1:49 - 1:55)
looked at the passport was so (1:52 - 1:55)
chill okay uh we have I also traveled my (1:56 - 2:03)
transition I also traveled uh to New (2:00 - 2:06)
York uh and we&#39;ll talk about the Stellar (2:03 - 2:08)
maze uh because that&#39;s where I went um (2:06 - 2:10)
but we do have a show we have the (2:08 - 2:12)
Stellar Maze We have some Pokemon sleep (2:10 - 2:15)
uh we have some new content for scarlet (2:12 - 2:16)
and violet although it might be just (2:15 - 2:19)
content that you are redoing for scarlet (2:16 - 2:22)
and violet and then there are some (2:19 - 2:23)
tournaments happening as well so that&#39;s (2:22 - 2:27)
our show for today um let&#39;s uh let&#39;s (2:23 - 2:29)
start off with the Stellar maze full (2:27 - 2:32)
disclosure as always uh the Pokemon (2:29 - 2:34)
company paid for my flight and my hotel (2:32 - 2:37)
to the Stellar maze which in my head was (2:34 - 2:39)
like oh maybe this is (2:37 - 2:43)
something uh and it was okay it (2:39 - 2:49)
was okay it was okay yes it was okay I (2:43 - 2:51)
you know when when they don&#39;t require me (2:49 - 2:54)
to like ever make content from this it&#39;s (2:51 - 2:55)
not like we&#39;re flying you out but we (2:54 - 2:58)
expect one YouTube video or like one in (2:55 - 3:01)
like they they don&#39;t ask for the only (2:58 - 3:04)
time they asked asked me to do something (3:01 - 3:08)
was for this past worlds which was they (3:04 - 3:11)
wanted one live stream one YouTube video (3:08 - 3:13)
two tweets but like I was going to do (3:11 - 3:16)
all that anyways so it was it was easy (3:13 - 3:19)
so I I&#39;m not not required to like talk (3:16 - 3:22)
highly about the Stellar maze but I (3:19 - 3:25)
don&#39;t think it was bad it was a free (3:22 - 3:28)
event it was anyone who was there yeah (3:25 - 3:30)
it was completely free how I think about (3:28 - 3:33)
events is is it good enough where Al (3:30 - 3:38)
would regret not booking a flight (3:33 - 3:38)
to and the answer is wait that question (3:39 - 3:43)
is (3:42 - 3:47)
complicated would Al so would I wouldn&#39;t (3:43 - 3:50)
regret not picking a flight presumably (3:47 - 3:52)
in this case I think that&#39;s right yeah (3:50 - 3:54)
you yes (3:52 - 3:59)
yes so like like Al came to uh cotour (3:54 - 4:00)
yeah (3:59 - 4:03)
and and for the people who maybe didn&#39;t (4:00 - 4:04)
listen to that episode because it was (4:03 - 4:06)
earlier this year did you was that worth (4:04 - 4:09)
the trip to America for you I think so I (4:06 - 4:11)
think if you were just going on your own (4:09 - 4:13)
probably not but like because I was (4:11 - 4:16)
meeting up with with you and some others (4:13 - 4:18)
as well quite a lot of people at one (4:16 - 4:22)
point um you know I think it&#39;s worth it (4:18 - 4:24)
for that and obviously the event still (4:22 - 4:26)
has to be enjoyable right because (4:24 - 4:27)
otherwise you&#39;re just going you&#39;re (4:26 - 4:28)
seeing some people and then you&#39;re going (4:27 - 4:31)
to an event you don&#39;t like uh (4:28 - 4:34)
so yeah I guess it&#39;s always hard to say (4:31 - 4:37)
is an event worth (4:34 - 4:40)
,000 and I feel like the answer to that (4:37 - 4:43)
is probably no on a like purely cost (4:40 - 4:46)
benefit analysis but if if you&#39;re going (4:43 - 4:49)
to do a trip then it was a good one to (4:46 - 4:52)
do but you&#39;re right booking a flight to (4:49 - 4:55)
New York for for what a popup Shop with (4:52 - 4:58)
a a mirror maze in it and some pictures (4:55 - 5:01)
of some cards probably not the most (4:58 - 5:03)
sensible thing for someone from Europe (5:01 - 5:04)
anyway (5:03 - 5:06)
yeah well I would I would assume there (5:04 - 5:08)
were a lot of (5:06 - 5:11)
people some people that came from Europe (5:08 - 5:13)
for New York Comic Con I was going to (5:11 - 5:15)
say that that was on that&#39;s on just now (5:13 - 5:17)
isn&#39;t it so if you&#39;re there already then (5:15 - 5:19)
it it it makes sense you know it was an (5:17 - 5:22)
event definitely coinciding like I am (5:19 - 5:24)
certain they made that event (5:22 - 5:25)
specifically to overlap with (5:24 - 5:28)
Comic-Con yeah they did not so Pokemon (5:25 - 5:31)
did not have a presence at Comic Con (5:28 - 5:33)
although I think in past years or maybe (5:31 - 5:34)
at this definitely at the San Diego (5:33 - 5:37)
Comic Con they had a presence right so (5:34 - 5:40)
uh I remember one person in the group of (5:37 - 5:41)
like (5:40 - 5:45)
creators was as asked asked Mr Mr (5:41 - 5:47)
Pikachu uh actually in this case it was (5:45 - 5:50)
Miss Pikachu they asked Miss Pikachu if (5:47 - 5:52)
uh they could get them into Comic-Con (5:50 - 5:55)
and they were like no no we don&#39;t we&#39;re (5:52 - 5:57)
not in Comic Con we&#39;re we&#39;re next to (5:55 - 5:59)
Comic conon but we&#39;re not in affiliation (5:57 - 6:02)
with him so (5:59 - 6:06)
uh the hotel they put us at was like (6:02 - 6:07)
it&#39;s a hotel that like Pokemon or (6:06 - 6:09)
Nintendo has used in the past but it (6:07 - 6:11)
it&#39;s Midtown so it&#39;s relatively close to (6:09 - 6:13)
the convention center I want to say it (6:11 - 6:14)
was like a 12 minute walk to the (6:13 - 6:16)
convention center and then from the (6:14 - 6:17)
convention center it was like only (6:16 - 6:20)
another like three minute walk to the (6:17 - 6:23)
Stellar maze so you if you&#39;re coming (6:20 - 6:24)
from the Center of Midtown you&#39;re going (6:23 - 6:25)
to (6:24 - 6:28)
walk past ComicCon (6:25 - 6:32)
itself uh which (6:28 - 6:35)
was a ComicCon it was like a very busy a (6:32 - 6:37)
lot of foot traffic a lot of like (6:35 - 6:40)
there&#39;s a a lot going on (6:37 - 6:42)
um (6:40 - 6:44)
I they brought us in on Friday night (6:42 - 6:47)
with like an early preview group um and (6:44 - 6:49)
there were there were the content (6:47 - 6:51)
creators of course and I&#39;m assuming (6:49 - 6:55)
there was media but there was also other (6:51 - 6:59)
people and I I don&#39;t I said this to real (6:55 - 7:01)
breaking was there I said this T Nate it (6:59 - 7:04)
was like I wonder how or why these other (7:01 - 7:07)
people are here not saying that like I&#39;m (7:04 - 7:09)
or we are better than these people but (7:07 - 7:12)
we&#39;re here because the Pokemon company (7:09 - 7:15)
brought us here for their event so like (7:12 - 7:19)
I&#39;m just curious of like what they do to (7:15 - 7:22)
be brought here like are they are they (7:19 - 7:24)
friends and family are they just people (7:22 - 7:27)
with money are they part of another (7:24 - 7:29)
group that&#39;s always interesting to me (7:27 - 7:31)
not because (7:29 - 7:34)
like just because of (7:31 - 7:36)
like some people there were obviously (7:34 - 7:39)
not content creators or or maybe not (7:36 - 7:41)
even Media or maybe they just didn&#39;t (7:39 - 7:42)
give that impression but there were (7:41 - 7:44)
definitely like a couple kids not a lot (7:42 - 7:45)
of kids actually I want to say I maybe (7:44 - 7:48)
like saw there&#39;s probably like 70 80 (7:45 - 7:50)
people like Early Access and I only saw (7:48 - 7:53)
like three or four kids but the kids (7:50 - 7:54)
were like excited that there were (7:53 - 7:58)
content creators there that&#39;s the day (7:54 - 8:00)
and age we live in these days (7:58 - 8:03)
um I would guess friends and family but (8:00 - 8:05)
it being in New York makes me feel like (8:03 - 8:07)
that&#39;s less likely just because so much (8:05 - 8:11)
of Pokemon is in (8:07 - 8:13)
Washington yeah I mean it&#39;s possible it (8:11 - 8:16)
was like ComiCon people or something (8:13 - 8:17)
like that like I know they weren&#39;t doing (8:16 - 8:20)
it with them but it it&#39;s possible they (8:17 - 8:22)
might have included some of them just to (8:20 - 8:26)
kind of get the buzz around it more oh (8:22 - 8:30)
sure or like um (8:26 - 8:31)
or I could think it because it was at it (8:30 - 8:34)
was it at Event Hall I think it was lean (8:31 - 8:38)
van I wonder if there are just like (8:34 - 8:41)
owners of that event Hall that are they (8:38 - 8:42)
can go to like any event they want (8:41 - 8:44)
because they own that event Hall so if (8:42 - 8:46)
they have like friends and family that (8:44 - 8:48)
are like super into Pokemon they&#39; be (8:46 - 8:50)
like well this is our this is our (8:48 - 8:53)
building so we can get you into set (8:50 - 8:56)
event that also potentially sounds (8:53 - 8:59)
likely I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know how how (8:56 - 9:01)
disconnected one would be from all the (8:59 - 9:02)
events that are happening in their (9:01 - 9:05)
building but possibly the other thing uh (9:02 - 9:08)
that could possibly be is there is a (9:05 - 9:10)
there&#39;s a Nintendo store in New York (9:08 - 9:13)
isn&#39;t there yeah could it be employees (9:10 - 9:15)
from there like just a par of working (9:13 - 9:17)
there I don&#39;t know I (9:15 - 9:20)
don&#39;t I wonder if any Nintendo store (9:17 - 9:22)
employees listen to this podcast I have (9:20 - 9:26)
no clue what like their benefits (9:22 - 9:30)
are like I&#39;m like I&#39;m they get a (9:26 - 9:31)
discount at the Nintendo store right I (9:30 - 9:33)
don&#39;t know what their discount is like (9:31 - 9:35)
10% off or something (9:33 - 9:39)
like um like dude Nintendo employees at (9:35 - 9:41)
the New York Nintendo store get like (9:39 - 9:46)
early access to alarmo is that like a (9:41 - 9:49)
thing like I like I would I would be C (9:46 - 9:51)
if you work at the Nintendo store in New (9:49 - 9:53)
York or you are a past employee you (9:51 - 9:55)
should you should email us because I&#39;d (9:53 - 9:57)
be very curious what your what Your (9:55 - 10:00)
Benefits are and also St Ally wants to (9:57 - 10:02)
know if any of you bought (10:00 - 10:05)
alarm yeah that&#39;s true that&#39;s true I was (10:02 - 10:08)
I was with a friend that weekend uh (10:05 - 10:09)
because so so I had like a breakfast (10:08 - 10:13)
meeting with with Mrs Pikachu uh which (10:09 - 10:15)
wasn&#39;t really a meeting it was just like (10:13 - 10:17)
thanks for coming here&#39;s breakfast and (10:15 - 10:20)
then they were like and then they were (10:17 - 10:22)
like you have three hours (10:20 - 10:25)
before you need to be at the Event Hall (10:22 - 10:27)
so you can do whatever you want and the (10:25 - 10:30)
way the table was talking they were like (10:27 - 10:31)
we want to go here we want to go to the (10:30 - 10:33)
Nintendo store and I was like I want to (10:31 - 10:35)
do none of that every time I&#39;ve been to (10:33 - 10:38)
New York like seven times this year I do (10:35 - 10:40)
not want to go to the Nintendo store I (10:38 - 10:42)
do not want to go to Time Square I (10:40 - 10:45)
please I just I can&#39;t handle any more of (10:42 - 10:47)
it I&#39;ve never been to New York but 3 (10:45 - 10:49)
hours doesn&#39;t sound like a lot of time (10:47 - 10:52)
to see the sites should we say you&#39;d be (10:49 - 10:54)
surprised yeah you get around pretty (10:52 - 10:56)
quickly so (10:54 - 11:00)
um I saw that there was a uh we&#39;ll get (10:56 - 11:02)
back to the Pokemon in a second but uh (11:00 - 11:05)
so I so I I left I left the the (11:02 - 11:07)
breakfast and we we just grabbed a (11:05 - 11:10)
coffee and then um my friend was like do (11:07 - 11:11)
you want to go to the Nintendo store to (11:10 - 11:15)
see if they have a larma and I was like (11:11 - 11:19)
no a second of me was like oh that would (11:15 - 11:21)
be cool if they were in stock but then (11:19 - 11:22)
I&#39;m like but I why would I buy I (11:21 - 11:24)
wouldn&#39;t use it I would buy it for the (11:22 - 11:27)
sake of buying it and then not do (11:24 - 11:28)
anything with it yeah I&#39;m not going to (11:27 - 11:31)
set it up on my bedside table you don&#39;t (11:28 - 11:32)
think it would look lovely on your (11:31 - 11:33)
shelves behind you (11:32 - 11:37)
no yeah put it next to my $100 Pokéballs (11:33 - 11:38)
exactly that&#39;s where you need an alarm (11:37 - 11:43)
clock in your office that&#39;s true F (11:38 - 11:46)
finally so (11:43 - 11:50)
I I I saw that there was a pop store in (11:46 - 11:51)
New (11:50 - 11:54)
York and I was like oh can we like just (11:51 - 11:56)
go down to the pop store and what was (11:54 - 11:57)
cool about the pop store is it was like (11:56 - 11:59)
right next to the World Trade Centers (11:57 - 12:01)
and I was like oh I&#39;ve never been like (11:59 - 12:02)
I&#39;ve been to New York so many times I&#39;ve (12:01 - 12:06)
never been to the World Trade Center (12:02 - 12:09)
Memorial like that whole thing so that (12:06 - 12:10)
was like a twoin one I was like We&#39;ll go (12:09 - 12:12)
to the pop store they&#39;ll be sold out of (12:10 - 12:14)
everything that&#39;s cool we&#39;ll go to the (12:12 - 12:15)
World Trade Center I&#39;m sure there&#39;s (12:14 - 12:16)
other stuff to see around there because (12:15 - 12:20)
New York is Big it&#39;s like you go to Time (12:16 - 12:22)
Square and you could you could waste (12:20 - 12:25)
your entire day in Time Square easily I (12:22 - 12:26)
have I never want to do that again but (12:25 - 12:29)
you could uh but even even during New (12:26 - 12:32)
York Fest I never made it down to the (12:29 - 12:35)
World Trade Center uh not that it&#39;s far (12:32 - 12:36)
like it is big but if you get in the (12:35 - 12:39)
subway it&#39;s only like 15 minutes from (12:36 - 12:40)
Time Square to to get down to World (12:39 - 12:44)
Trade Center so we we we get to World (12:40 - 12:45)
Trade Center and then I was like okay it (12:44 - 12:47)
looks like the pop store is in this mall (12:45 - 12:49)
over here um which is like literally (12:47 - 12:50)
across the street from World Trade (12:49 - 12:55)
Center and I was looking for uh laboos (12:50 - 12:58)
which is if you&#39;re on Tik Tok and you (12:55 - 13:00)
may have heard of this they&#39;re like (12:58 - 13:02)
going crazy right now they&#39;re it&#39;s just (13:00 - 13:06)
like a designer toy like a labit or a (13:02 - 13:07)
trying to think of other designer toys I (13:06 - 13:08)
used to (13:07 - 13:11)
collect anyways they&#39;re called La booos (13:08 - 13:13)
they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re just they&#39;re (13:11 - 13:15)
whatever they&#39;re just a toy they&#39;re like (13:13 - 13:17)
you giving no helpful description yeah (13:15 - 13:19)
you you described something else that (13:17 - 13:21)
I&#39;ve also not heard (13:19 - 13:24)
of okay what do they&#39;re kind of like (13:21 - 13:27)
fuzzy little monsters that are keychains (13:24 - 13:29)
okay and they&#39;re blind boxes so you&#39;re (13:27 - 13:31)
like like oh I got a pink one I got a (13:29 - 13:33)
brown one I got a blue one right they&#39;re (13:31 - 13:36)
just designer toys they&#39;re a big fad (13:33 - 13:38)
right now who knows how long the last (13:36 - 13:42)
but I was like designer toys yeah like (13:38 - 13:43)
like Beanie (13:42 - 13:47)
Babies more (13:43 - 13:47)
expensive no well I mean depends which (13:47 - 13:54)
ones like you know bear brick (13:51 - 13:57)
nope what there was a Pikachu bear brick (13:54 - 14:00)
Oh yes okay like those are designer toys (13:57 - 14:02)
right you just buy them you set them up (14:00 - 14:04)
or what what&#39;s that other thing (14:02 - 14:07)

would be the same like yeah I don&#39;t know (14:12 - 14:16)
how many of these I don&#39;t know because (14:14 - 14:18)
I&#39;m not American or or just because I&#39;m (14:16 - 14:20)
I&#39;m not aware of those things I don&#39;t (14:18 - 14:21)
know well clearly I don&#39;t know most of (14:20 - 14:23)
them either I know the one that there (14:21 - 14:26)
was a Pikachu of yeah bear brick yeah (14:23 - 14:30)
there was never a Pikachu claws (14:26 - 14:30)
anyways I was like laoo are like they&#39;re (14:31 - 14:36)
like 25 bucks right they&#39;re a little box (14:34 - 14:39)
25 bucks buy it they&#39;ve been sold out (14:36 - 14:41)
everywhere okay so I was like cool (14:39 - 14:43)
there&#39;s there&#39;s like a pop store in La (14:41 - 14:44)
there&#39;s a pop store in New York there&#39;s (14:43 - 14:46)
a pop store in Chicago that&#39;s kind of it (14:44 - 14:47)
I was like I&#39;m just going to go to pop (14:46 - 14:50)
store they&#39;re going to be sold out I&#39;m G (14:47 - 14:52)
to be like oh I tried and then I&#39;m going (14:50 - 14:53)
to go to the World Trade Center and see (14:52 - 14:57)
some sites uh I get there and pop store (14:53 - 14:59)
is empty there&#39;s two employees standing (14:57 - 15:02)
out front I go they go oh are you here (14:59 - 15:05)
for the LA booos I was like H yeah (15:02 - 15:07)
that&#39;s why I&#39;m here they&#39;re like oh (15:05 - 15:09)
we&#39;re just doing a brand new drop of LA (15:07 - 15:12)
booos but you have to wait in (15:09 - 15:15)
line and the line is over by like the (15:12 - 15:17)
Apple store which is on the other side (15:15 - 15:19)
of the ball I was like okay so we go (15:17 - 15:20)
there there&#39;s only like 10 people in (15:19 - 15:23)
line I was like oh perfect like this is (15:20 - 15:25)
what what convenient and great timing (15:23 - 15:27)
did you even ask how long it was until (15:25 - 15:29)
you yeah I didn&#39;t ask how I didn&#39;t ask (15:27 - 15:31)
how long it was we get to the line and (15:29 - 15:34)
they say um Yep this is the line for La (15:31 - 15:36)
booos we&#39;re doing a new drop it was (15:34 - 15:37)
super hectic this morning they had call (15:36 - 15:40)
Mall Security so we&#39;re doing it this way (15:37 - 15:41)
um which this all makes sense it&#39;s a (15:40 - 15:44)
very American thing where like sought (15:41 - 15:46)
after products needs (15:44 - 15:48)
security so they were like we&#39;re only (15:46 - 15:50)
letting 10 people stand in this line (15:48 - 15:52)
before they move we move them to the (15:50 - 15:55)
line in front of the store and it&#39;s (15:52 - 15:57)
capped so you need to just wait around (15:55 - 16:00)
the store but don&#39;t wait here which is (15:57 - 16:02)
like another American thing I feel like (16:00 - 16:04)
I&#39;ve dealt with at other stuff this is (16:02 - 16:06)
like a thing if you&#39;ve ever gone to a (16:04 - 16:08)
Pax this is what they do at packs too (16:06 - 16:10)
they&#39;ll cap the line and they&#39;ll say you (16:08 - 16:14)
can&#39;t get in line but don&#39;t form a line (16:10 - 16:15)
outside of the line to get in the line (16:14 - 16:17)
so you kind of have to like Pace back (16:15 - 16:18)
and (16:17 - 16:22)
forth and we s like a terrible system it (16:18 - 16:24)
it&#39;s it&#39;s awful it&#39;s awful but they said (16:22 - 16:26)
they they explained that the mall didn&#39;t (16:24 - 16:28)
want long line so that&#39;s why they were (16:26 - 16:30)
capping at 10 (16:28 - 16:33)
so we like go into the Apple Store and (16:30 - 16:34)
you could tell that the Apple store (16:33 - 16:35)
employees knew that half of us were (16:34 - 16:38)
waiting to get into this (16:35 - 16:38)
lauo anyways 45 minutes pass we get into (16:39 - 16:44)
the line of labubu where a bunch of (16:42 - 16:46)
people just sprinted towards the line (16:44 - 16:48)
and I didn&#39;t Sprint I&#39;m not a sprinter (16:46 - 16:50)
but the my friend who I was with she was (16:48 - 16:52)
determined to get this lauo for me just (16:50 - 16:54)
hearing about labubu for the first time (16:52 - 16:57)
of you guys hearing about labubu has no (16:54 - 17:00)
clue so she sprinted got in line so we (16:57 - 17:02)
got in line for the lauo we waited (17:00 - 17:05)
another 30 minutes and then while I&#39;m in (17:02 - 17:08)
line they&#39;re like get your list ready (17:05 - 17:09)
you need to know exactly what you want (17:08 - 17:11)
when you get in have your QR code ready (17:09 - 17:14)
as a pop member have your ticket ready (17:11 - 17:15)
because they gave us a little ticket to (17:14 - 17:17)
so no one could like squeeze in because (17:15 - 17:18)
you had to have the (17:17 - 17:20)
ticket and they got to me and I was like (17:18 - 17:22)
I&#39;m super sorry I know nothing about (17:20 - 17:26)
this except I want one I don&#39;t know what (17:22 - 17:28)
I want cuz you won&#39;t let me into the (17:26 - 17:30)
store and like oh that&#39;s fine some (17:28 - 17:32)
people just have a list of things they (17:30 - 17:34)
want you&#39;re like allowed to buy like one (17:32 - 17:35)
thing when you get in there so when I (17:34 - 17:38)
went in there I could either buy one lab (17:35 - 17:41)
boooo or I could buy a box of lab boooo (17:38 - 17:43)
which was six (17:41 - 17:46)
laboos so I was like I guess I&#39;m buying (17:43 - 17:48)
the box (17:46 - 17:50)
cuz like realistically in my head I was (17:48 - 17:52)
like oh I would buy two but I&#39;m only (17:50 - 17:56)
allowed to buy one so that&#39;s like (17:52 - 17:59)
$150 of I (17:56 - 18:01)
it was (17:59 - 18:05)
$136 of laoo that I have so so an alarm (18:01 - 18:07)
clock that you won&#39;t use of $100 that&#39;s (18:05 - 18:12)
too much but $150 of monster (18:07 - 18:15)
keychains if it makes someone happy I&#39;m (18:12 - 18:18)
not sure well I well I was going I was (18:15 - 18:19)
going (18:18 - 18:22)
for I was going for somebody else but I (18:19 - 18:23)
also wanted one that&#39;s why I wanted two (18:22 - 18:26)
like one for me one for her um but then (18:23 - 18:30)
I ended up getting six laboos uh anyways (18:26 - 18:32)
that whole process took two hours of my (18:30 - 18:35)
three-hour free time in New York which I (18:32 - 18:37)
wasn&#39;t again I was expecting to get to (18:35 - 18:38)
the pop store them being like we&#39;re sold (18:37 - 18:41)
out and be like yep that makes sense uh (18:38 - 18:43)
but I happened to arrive just as they (18:41 - 18:45)
were doing a new release of lauo and (18:43 - 18:47)
then I saw the World Trade Center and (18:45 - 18:49)
then I got yelled at because I was like (18:47 - 18:52)
leaning to take a photo and they were (18:49 - 18:54)
like you can&#39;t lean on the thing because (18:52 - 18:56)
that&#39;s where the memorial names are and (18:54 - 18:58)
then I felt bad but I was just trying to (18:56 - 19:00)
get a good photo (18:58 - 19:01)
so don&#39;t if you go to the World Trade (19:00 - 19:03)
Center Memorial do not (19:01 - 19:06)
lean on the memorial even though (19:03 - 19:08)
everyone else is leaning but I was the (19:06 - 19:09)
one that got (19:08 - 19:14)
killed lesson learned there yeah lesson (19:09 - 19:19)
learned classic um so after my La boooo (19:14 - 19:20)
Journey there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s going to (19:19 - 19:22)
be at least like two people in our (19:20 - 19:24)
YouTube comments being like I can&#39;t (19:22 - 19:27)
believe you got laoo it&#39;s gonna be great (19:24 - 19:29)
shout out to the laoo people (19:27 - 19:34)
um the Stellar maze was not a maze (19:29 - 19:37)
that&#39;s that&#39;s really what it it (19:34 - 19:39)
was they I I looked up on the website (19:37 - 19:43)
and they explicitly said a mirror maze (19:39 - 19:45)
they used the word maze outside of the (19:43 - 19:47)
title I can&#39;t believe they would (19:45 - 19:49)
advertise falsely like that if I want a (19:47 - 19:53)
miror maze I expect a miror maze uh I (19:49 - 19:56)
mean it was a maze in the fact that (19:53 - 19:59)
there was like two turns you had to do (19:56 - 20:01)
there were (19:59 - 20:04)
the there were dead ends there were (20:01 - 20:06)
there were like four dead ends and then (20:04 - 20:07)
like there was the one way to get out of (20:06 - 20:10)
the maze (20:07 - 20:14)
it I don&#39;t know like they defin like (20:10 - 20:15)
there was like like I said there was (20:14 - 20:17)
like 80 of us maybe and they were only (20:15 - 20:18)
letting like four people in at a time (20:17 - 20:20)
and then they would wait like two full (20:18 - 20:21)
minutes and they would let another four (20:20 - 20:24)
people in so it went relatively quickly (20:21 - 20:26)
um it&#39;s like the thing you get with a a (20:24 - 20:29)
mirror maze though is like you see (20:26 - 20:30)
somebody come out of a dead end and (20:29 - 20:33)
you&#39;re like well I know that&#39;s the dead (20:30 - 20:35)
end because why would you be (20:33 - 20:38)
backtracking (20:35 - 20:42)
yeah uh maybe Mires has got much (20:38 - 20:45)
better but I did think the mirrors were (20:42 - 20:48)
set up in a way where it (20:45 - 20:50)
was (20:48 - 20:53)
almost it was it it seemed easy to walk (20:50 - 20:54)
into a (20:53 - 20:58)
mirror and I I I would say that if you (20:54 - 21:01)
were maybe the underage of under the age (20:58 - 21:04)
of like 10 and you were running some kid (21:01 - 21:06)
was running face first into a (21:04 - 21:09)
mirror like there&#39;s like and again maybe (21:06 - 21:10)
it was cuz like the there wasn&#39;t that (21:09 - 21:13)
many people or it was brand new or maybe (21:10 - 21:15)
there just wasn&#39;t smudges on the mirror (21:13 - 21:16)
because people weren&#39;t like touching (21:15 - 21:17)
them yet because we were like the first (21:16 - 21:21)
people in but mirr Clarity was at an (21:17 - 21:24)
alltime (21:21 - 21:26)
high that sounds maybe a little bit (21:24 - 21:29)
better than I had thought the event was (21:26 - 21:32)
that&#39;s kind of neat yeah (21:29 - 21:35)
um and then if you looked directly up (21:32 - 21:36)
you it would it was very obvious once (21:35 - 21:39)
you like looked up to be like oh I know (21:36 - 21:42)
I know how to get out of here um I don&#39;t (21:39 - 21:45)
know I anytime I hear like a corn maze (21:42 - 21:48)
or a mere maze or any sort of (21:45 - 21:50)
maze I always think of like those mazes (21:48 - 21:53)
in movies where people are lost for like (21:50 - 21:55)
20 30 minutes (21:53 - 21:58)
right like a like an actual like like (21:55 - 21:59)
the gosh I hateing up Harry Potter cuz I (21:58 - 22:01)
can&#39;t stand Harry Potter anymore but (21:59 - 22:02)
like the Harry Potter Goblet of Fire (22:01 - 22:06)
maze as a kid and you&#39;re reading that (22:02 - 22:08)
book you&#39;re like man I would love to go (22:06 - 22:12)
through one of those mazes were you all (22:08 - 22:14)
right maybe without the dragons and the (22:12 - 22:16)
Scorpions but like and everything trying (22:14 - 22:19)
to kill you um yeah just like a hedge (22:16 - 22:22)
maze just go to a corn maze it&#39;s the (22:19 - 22:24)
right time of year I&#39;m sure they exist (22:22 - 22:25)
nearby you but I feel like the corn (22:24 - 22:27)
mazes are never good either I feel like (22:25 - 22:29)
the cor no the corn mazes can be great (22:27 - 22:34)
maybe this is maybe in wait (22:29 - 22:34)
wait oh (22:34 - 22:40)
no we found a uniquely American thing (22:36 - 22:44)
maybe do your country even grow corn Al (22:40 - 22:46)
oh I don&#39;t know probably we grw a bunch (22:44 - 22:48)
of stuff I I I mean we probably call (22:46 - 22:50)
some like because I think what you call (22:48 - 22:55)
Corin is we call maze which is (22:50 - 22:55)
amaz but I&#39;m thinking of so like (22:56 - 23:02)
I know about what like a hay maze would (22:59 - 23:03)
be right like I&#39;ve seen that in like (23:02 - 23:05)
Gilmore Girls where they had like the (23:03 - 23:07)
big bales of hay and they made a maze (23:05 - 23:10)
out of that but how do you do that with (23:07 - 23:12)
corn is it just the same thing or it&#39;s (23:10 - 23:14)
it&#39;s more like a like a hedge maze (23:12 - 23:16)
except instead of green bushes it&#39;s just (23:14 - 23:20)
corn oh like growing in the field yeah (23:16 - 23:23)
yeah oh how dense are they can you not (23:20 - 23:27)
see through they&#39;re pretty well the the (23:23 - 23:28)
different routes are pretty spread out (23:27 - 23:30)
so you usually can&#39;t see through unless (23:28 - 23:32)
there&#39;s like a U-turn right there what (23:30 - 23:34)
I&#39;ve seen I&#39;ve been to one that was like (23:32 - 23:36)
kind of okay but again it was like you (23:34 - 23:38)
see somebody com out you see somebody (23:36 - 23:39)
backtracking you just know that&#39;s a dead (23:38 - 23:41)
end you just have to be spread out (23:39 - 23:43)
enough there have to be few enough (23:41 - 23:44)
people (23:43 - 23:46)
there but I&#39;ve seen it where when they (23:44 - 23:49)
cut the the corn to make the maze they (23:46 - 23:51)
take that leftover and then they stick (23:49 - 23:53)
it in between and then they use ropes to (23:51 - 23:56)
make it like more densely (23:53 - 23:59)
packed how tall does Maze grow sorry (23:56 - 24:02)
tall corn corn like six like six feet (23:59 - 24:04)
five five six feet really I don&#39;t think (24:02 - 24:07)
I&#39;ve ever seen it (24:04 - 24:10)
growing yeah most of the farms near me (24:07 - 24:14)
are animal farms so you should look up (24:10 - 24:18)
what a corn maze looks like I promise in (24:14 - 24:18)
theak yeah I mean if there if there were (24:20 - 24:23)
no other people I think it would be a (24:22 - 24:25)
better experience but the problem is (24:23 - 24:27)
that capitalism they got to get as many (24:25 - 24:29)
people um people through as fast as (24:27 - 24:30)
possible to make as much money and then (24:29 - 24:32)
all of a sudden it&#39;s like just follow (24:30 - 24:33)
the people in front of you because they (24:32 - 24:34)
keep (24:33 - 24:36)
backtracking Steve just trying to Mid (24:34 - 24:39)
Max (24:36 - 24:39)
mazes um so before we went into the maze (24:40 - 24:46)
they they they did have like a photo (24:44 - 24:48)
opportunity place where you could stand (24:46 - 24:50)
in front get a photo (24:48 - 24:52)
um with with with what looked like like (24:50 - 24:54)
an infinity background behind you and (24:52 - 24:56)
then they had like little desserts and (24:54 - 24:58)
appetizers which obviously wouldn&#39;t have (24:56 - 24:59)
been their Saturday or Sunday because it (24:58 - 25:02)
was like an early preview event um and (24:59 - 25:05)
then they said while supplies last they (25:02 - 25:08)
had little gift bags so you could uh in (25:05 - 25:09)
the gift bag I think was two or three (25:08 - 25:13)
booster packs um a deck box I think a (25:09 - 25:15)
coupon for Pokemon Center which is (25:13 - 25:16)
really great because I the Christmas (25:15 - 25:17)
collection just came out on Pokemon (25:16 - 25:20)
Center um I think it was like a five or (25:17 - 25:22)
10% off Pokemon Center your Pokemon (25:20 - 25:25)
Center purchase um and then like an (25:22 - 25:28)
advertisement for like Stellar Crown so (25:25 - 25:29)

packs a deck box a coupon and a little (25:29 - 25:36)
like bag that you get to keep just a (25:33 - 25:37)
wait in line for this maze like a pretty (25:36 - 25:40)
good free gift where the while supplies (25:37 - 25:42)
last I don&#39;t were they Stell maze or (25:40 - 25:45)
were they a different set uh they were (25:42 - 25:47)
the the set that&#39;s currently out right (25:45 - 25:50)
okay Stellar Crown was the booster packs (25:47 - 25:56)
in the pack and then the the S surging (25:50 - 25:57)
Sparks is the set that they&#39;re (25:56 - 26:00)
advertising so sorry in case I (25:57 - 26:04)
misspoke so when you got through the (26:00 - 26:08)
maze uh then they had jumbo cards of the (26:04 - 26:11)
EXE the alolan exeggutor the the the the (26:08 - 26:13)
Stellar Pikachu Latios laas I think (26:11 - 26:16)
there was one more card um but all of (26:13 - 26:17)
that was like photo opportunities so (26:16 - 26:19)
each one of those giant cards with the (26:17 - 26:21)
crystals had like a person there to like (26:19 - 26:26)
take a photo um it was there was lights (26:21 - 26:28)
and everything everywhere and there was (26:26 - 26:31)
like a lot of like Pikachu electric (26:28 - 26:33)
noises happening in the background and (26:31 - 26:35)
then there was a a wall that had like (26:33 - 26:38)
maybe 10 or 12 iPads where you could (26:35 - 26:40)
like look through the card list of (26:38 - 26:42)

generous I feel like and then just more (26:54 - 26:59)
photo opportunities with jump Pokemon (26:57 - 27:02)
cards do I think Al should have flown (26:59 - 27:04)
out or anyone else should have flown out (27:02 - 27:06)
for this event no but I think if you (27:04 - 27:08)
flew out for Comic-Con and you liked (27:06 - 27:10)
Pokemon I think it was like a perfect (27:08 - 27:13)
addition to that um and it does make (27:10 - 27:15)
sense that it wouldn&#39;t be in Comic-Con (27:13 - 27:18)
because it was an entire event Hall like (27:15 - 27:20)
even though the maze was relatively tiny (27:18 - 27:22)
you still need a kind of a big space to (27:20 - 27:24)
set up a bunch of mirrors to have people (27:22 - 27:27)
walk through (27:24 - 27:29)
yeah yeah sounds like if you sounds like (27:27 - 27:31)
if you were in New York and obviously (27:29 - 27:32)
when people are hearing this it&#39;s over (27:31 - 27:34)
it was just this weekend right but if (27:32 - 27:36)
you were in New York sounds like it was (27:34 - 27:39)
a fun thing to do but yeah not a not a (27:36 - 27:42)
traveling thing to do yeah no and I mean (27:39 - 27:44)
it was free so how can you like the only (27:42 - 27:45)
thing I guess you could complain about (27:44 - 27:47)
is like the wait time like I don&#39;t know (27:45 - 27:50)
how long an average person waited in (27:47 - 27:54)
line for this experience um I guess my (27:50 - 27:55)
feedback I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s (27:54 - 27:57)
feedback I would like to see more of (27:55 - 28:00)
these in relation to like a Gen Con a (27:57 - 28:03)
San Diego Comic Con even like a twitch (28:00 - 28:05)
con or something just like because (28:03 - 28:08)
Pokemon is so (28:05 - 28:11)
infused in media like Disney or Star (28:08 - 28:15)
Wars or Harry Potter um it just like (28:11 - 28:18)
makes sense for them to be at these (28:15 - 28:22)
events uh in some (28:18 - 28:26)
capacity so yeah but I I don&#39;t think (28:22 - 28:27)
they could get away with like charging (28:26 - 28:29)
like well I mean they could I mean the (28:27 - 28:30)
Pokemon they could get away with (28:29 - 28:33)
charging people to do this but uh it (28:30 - 28:34)
would have to be (28:33 - 28:38)
more more to it but I think for a free (28:34 - 28:39)
event it was like kind of perfect they (28:38 - 28:42)
they did have like three exclusive Poké (28:39 - 28:43)
stops there that had like you could get (28:42 - 28:46)
Stellar maze gifts from the Poké stops (28:43 - 28:48)
obviously um and they weren&#39;t obviously (28:46 - 28:50)
they weren&#39;t there before because they (28:48 - 28:55)
were Stellar maze Pok stops yeah um but (28:50 - 28:56)
there was like nothing Pokemon go (28:55 - 28:58)
related I know sometime I think there (28:56 - 29:00)
was a Comic-Con where Pokémon go did a (28:58 - 29:03)
couple unknown letter letters um a (29:00 - 29:05)
couple of them I think but I don&#39;t think (29:03 - 29:07)
any of them have been New York ComicCon (29:05 - 29:09)
I could be wrong there yeah I think they (29:07 - 29:11)
were San Diego yeah because I think (29:09 - 29:12)
Bobby went to one (29:11 - 29:14)
for (29:12 - 29:16)
something um yeah there was like no (29:14 - 29:19)
Pokemon go or anything obviously they (29:16 - 29:20)
didn&#39;t they didn&#39;t have a (29:19 - 29:23)
booth inside Comic-Con although Pokemon (29:20 - 29:26)
has had a booth at packs where they&#39;ve (29:23 - 29:28)
had like the learn to play the TC or (29:26 - 29:30)
learn to play the VGC (29:28 - 29:33)
or um demos of the game so there were (29:30 - 29:35)
like nothing game related it it was like (29:33 - 29:36)
a (29:35 - 29:40)
TCG Showcase of the cards and stuff but (29:36 - 29:43)
yeah it was it was cool it sounds like (29:40 - 29:45)
it was a good way for them to be a part (29:43 - 29:47)
of Comic Con without actually being a (29:45 - 29:50)
part of Comic Con that they had to (29:47 - 29:52)
because they weren&#39;t actually a part of (29:50 - 29:54)
the convention they had to be in a (29:52 - 29:55)
separate location which means they had (29:54 - 29:57)
to have something good enough that (29:55 - 30:00)
people would take the time to go to it (29:57 - 30:03)
hence being a big event space with a (30:00 - 30:07)
mirror maze but also still free just (30:03 - 30:09)
like anything once you are in ComicCon (30:07 - 30:11)
you can participate in a lot of things (30:09 - 30:13)
not not everything is free definitely um (30:11 - 30:15)
but lots of things (30:13 - 30:18)
are kind of like any of the panels I saw (30:15 - 30:21)
pictures of people like I saw a picture (30:18 - 30:23)
I think it was in Time Square of an (30:21 - 30:25)
advertisement for the Stellar (30:23 - 30:28)
maze I didn&#39;t see any of those myself (30:25 - 30:30)
but there were definitely advertisements (30:28 - 30:32)
in New York for it and like I said if (30:30 - 30:34)
you were at ComicCon it was literally (30:32 - 30:37)
three blocks over yeah it was such a (30:34 - 30:40)
simple walk (30:37 - 30:42)
um but yeah i&#39; I&#39;d (30:40 - 30:45)
be I I I (30:42 - 30:48)
liked I like the concept of just Pokemon (30:45 - 30:51)
being at these events um there was like (30:48 - 30:53)
no merch store or anything like that (30:51 - 30:54)
although I don&#39;t know if that would have (30:53 - 30:56)
been good or bad there&#39;s like nothing to (30:54 - 30:59)
buy h (30:56 - 31:00)
um I feel like that would massively (30:59 - 31:03)
increase the complexity right because I (31:00 - 31:06)
think having a couple thousand booster (31:03 - 31:09)
packs is much smaller than also having (31:06 - 31:14)
plushies and yeah tops and you know (31:09 - 31:15)
never mind if you&#39;re going to have any (31:14 - 31:16)
of the bear worker skateboards or (31:15 - 31:18)
anything like that you know it it&#39;s (31:16 - 31:21)
suddenly the increase in how much space (31:18 - 31:23)
you need for that is is and how much (31:21 - 31:25)
Transportation you need for the event (31:23 - 31:27)
and all of the things in it plus the (31:25 - 31:30)
Nintendo stores in the same City so I (31:27 - 31:32)
guess I&#39;m not too surprised but I am a (31:30 - 31:33)
little surprised that there wasn&#39;t a (31:32 - 31:36)
shop yeah I mean I think of like the go (31:33 - 31:37)
Fest in (31:36 - 31:41)
Seattle and they underestimated how the (31:37 - 31:43)
merch and that merch store was massive (31:41 - 31:44)
the one in Seattle I don&#39;t know if you (31:43 - 31:47)
remember that or I guess you guys didn&#39;t (31:44 - 31:48)
go to that (31:47 - 31:52)
one wrong people here it was a very big (31:48 - 31:56)
merch store in for for the for Seattle (31:52 - 31:59)
go Fest and from what I I heard from (31:56 - 32:02)
employees that were working in the store (31:59 - 32:04)
uh because NCH doesn&#39;t tell me anything (32:02 - 32:07)
is that they literally had to call (32:04 - 32:12)
in more merch than what they originally (32:07 - 32:14)
had in the back and they had to like fly (32:12 - 32:17)
in overnight more merch in because they (32:14 - 32:19)
just didn&#39;t realize the supply and (32:17 - 32:22)
demand yeah I can&#39;t believe they would (32:19 - 32:23)
kind wouldn&#39;t realize by this point (32:22 - 32:26)
right like they but um I I just feel (32:23 - 32:28)
like no matter how much merch they bring (32:26 - 32:30)
to any of these events they will always (32:28 - 32:32)
sell out like it&#39;s just kind (32:30 - 32:35)
of just a thing that happens with them (32:32 - 32:37)
now and I also they&#39;re playing a game of (32:35 - 32:39)
they they want to sell (32:37 - 32:41)
out they don&#39;t want to have to transport (32:39 - 32:43)
any of it back yeah but they also don&#39;t (32:41 - 32:44)
want to sell out too quickly because (32:43 - 32:46)
that&#39;s where you get the negative presss (32:44 - 32:47)
so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they were (32:46 - 32:49)
saying this is just a weekend thing it&#39;s (32:47 - 32:51)
just to talk about the TCG we don&#39;t want (32:49 - 32:53)
to have to deal with the negative price (32:51 - 32:54)
that comes from selling out on the (32:53 - 32:56)
Friday you (32:54 - 32:58)
know I don&#39;t know well it&#39;s the negative (32:56 - 33:00)
press and it&#39;s the missed opportunity of (32:58 - 33:02)
more sales so there&#39;s a lot of things to (33:00 - 33:03)
balance there (33:02 - 33:05)
yeah yeah I think I think though if (33:03 - 33:08)
you&#39;re like a if you&#39;re like a family of (33:05 - 33:10)
four (33:08 - 33:13)
um whether you went to Comic-Con or not (33:10 - 33:15)
I think like waiting online for all of (33:13 - 33:16)
you to get like two free booster packs (33:15 - 33:19)
and some other stuff again I don&#39;t I (33:16 - 33:22)
mean I waited 90 minutes for a stuffed (33:19 - 33:25)
keychain more than 90 (33:22 - 33:27)
minutes six yeah six of them I haven&#39;t (33:25 - 33:30)
even opened any of them yet (33:27 - 33:32)
um (33:30 - 33:34)
uh I don&#39;t know there&#39;s there I think (33:32 - 33:37)
the thing I think about is is it ever is (33:34 - 33:40)
it worth your time waiting in a (33:37 - 33:45)
line for the labubu (33:40 - 33:45)
unsure for for anything Pokemon you know (33:45 - 33:51)
also unsure right like when we talked (33:48 - 33:54)
about worlds in Hawaii like how many (33:51 - 33:57)
people like I did I did wait in line (33:54 - 33:59)
like I I I get it I got the content (33:57 - 34:01)
creator thing I went in early but I I (33:59 - 34:04)
wanted to see what that experience was (34:01 - 34:05)
like for somebody who wasn&#39;t a content (34:04 - 34:08)
creator and I waited with my friend Lee (34:05 - 34:12)
and that&#39;s where I told the parking lot (34:08 - 34:13)
we like we waited in a parking garage in (34:12 - 34:15)
Hawaii and I wouldn&#39;t have gotten that (34:13 - 34:18)
experience if I didn&#39;t go with my friend (34:15 - 34:19)
Lee to be like I want to see what your (34:18 - 34:24)
experience is like and the common (34:19 - 34:24)
folk but like (34:26 - 34:30)
I did feel bad for the people who waited (34:28 - 34:33)
in a parking garage to get inside the (34:30 - 34:34)
store to be like oh all the good stuff (34:33 - 34:37)
is sold out like that (34:34 - 34:40)
sucks um so like to wait like if you (34:37 - 34:42)
waited in line 30 40 minutes for some (34:40 - 34:45)
free booster packs to then get a photo (34:42 - 34:47)
do the maze get more photos I think (34:45 - 34:51)
that&#39;s worth it um but if somebody was (34:47 - 34:53)
like no I waited in the seller line for (34:51 - 34:55)
three hours like I don&#39;t know it sounds (34:53 - 34:59)
a little long it also depend what you&#39;ve (34:55 - 35:01)
got going on that day and you know if (34:59 - 35:02)
you&#39;re if you&#39;ve not got anything else (35:01 - 35:03)
planned and you&#39;re just happy to chill (35:02 - 35:06)
on the street for a couple of hours you (35:03 - 35:08)
know yeah I think at that point if you (35:06 - 35:10)
were someone who had a ticket to New (35:08 - 35:12)
York Comic Con 3 hours may not have been (35:10 - 35:14)
worth it in line for the Pokemon thing (35:12 - 35:16)
but if you weren&#39;t and you were just in (35:14 - 35:19)
New York could have been worth it yeah (35:16 - 35:23)
yeah yeah I the again this my own my (35:19 - 35:25)
last feedback would be like it was cool (35:23 - 35:27)
that they put three Poké stops there cuz (35:25 - 35:29)
then you can get like the Stellar maze (35:27 - 35:31)
gifts and like while I was in line as (35:29 - 35:33)
they were still like setting up um I (35:31 - 35:37)
like kept spinning them to get gifts but (35:33 - 35:40)
put a gym there just (35:37 - 35:40)
like like put a (35:41 - 35:47)
Dynamax gym there like nanta can place (35:43 - 35:49)
them wherever they want so if there&#39;s a (35:47 - 35:50)
specific Pokemon it&#39;s the only Pokemon (35:49 - 35:53)
event happening that well besides the (35:50 - 35:55)
the tournament but like you know what I (35:53 - 35:56)
mean like it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a (35:55 - 36:00)
ComicCon every weekend (35:56 - 36:00)
like the Pokemon company could just be (36:01 - 36:06)
like Niantic we need Poké stops and (36:03 - 36:09)
whatever your newest thing is put a (36:06 - 36:11)
Dynamax Bulbasaur here so at least when (36:09 - 36:14)
people are standing in line they can do (36:11 - 36:17)
something like it&#39;s it&#39;s one of the few (36:14 - 36:21)
games in the world where you (36:17 - 36:24)
can do real life activations for people (36:21 - 36:27)
waiting in lines yeah and you could do (36:24 - 36:28)
them together with the other people who (36:27 - 36:30)
are waiting in line with you which can (36:28 - 36:36)
be a fun thing yeah totally um all right (36:30 - 36:38)
uh because we are the premier Pokemon (36:36 - 36:41)
sleep podcast in the world we did not (36:38 - 36:42)
forget about Pokemon sleep we&#39;ll take a (36:41 - 36:45)
quick break and when we come back we (36:42 - 36:48)
will talk about mimiku coming to Pokemon (36:45 - 36:50)
sleep before it is coming to Pokemon (36:48 - 36:54)
go so we we&#39;ll be right (36:50 - 36:58)
back and we are back from our break (36:54 - 36:59)
Pokemon (36:58 - 37:01)
sleep wait hold on Al are you playing (36:59 - 37:04)
Pokemon sleep I am C now that it works (37:01 - 37:06)
with the you were a Fitbit person right (37:04 - 37:08)
I am a Fitbit person yeah so the moment (37:06 - 37:09)
the moment I saw that I was like right (37:08 - 37:11)
I&#39;m back on I&#39;m back on the train if I (37:09 - 37:14)
don&#39;t have to do anything to make this (37:11 - 37:16)
sleep work which is great because my (37:14 - 37:18)
problem is right so I started the game (37:16 - 37:21)
when it started uhuh and you&#39;re a day (37:18 - 37:23)
one player I&#39;m a day one player I yeah (37:21 - 37:25)
yeah I I downloaded the APK before it (37:23 - 37:27)
was available in my country I was like (37:25 - 37:29)
I&#39;m I&#39;m (37:27 - 37:32)
not so yeah I was I was right back even (37:29 - 37:34)
though I was like I was at a I was (37:32 - 37:36)
leading a a kids camp at that point so I (37:34 - 37:38)
was like and I didn&#39;t obviously have the (37:36 - 37:40)
Plus+ so I was like trying to figure out (37:38 - 37:42)
how to get my phone to charge in a tent (37:40 - 37:45)
overnight so that I can actually track (37:42 - 37:47)
it was a whole thing anyway do you not (37:45 - 37:49)
have an external battery for Pokémon go (37:47 - 37:51)
well I I do of course but it&#39;s pretty (37:49 - 37:53)
big like I don&#39;t have a small one I have (37:51 - 37:55)
like one of these massive ones so it&#39;s (37:53 - 37:57)
like trying to figure out a place in the (37:55 - 37:58)
bed where not going to knock it off (37:57 - 38:01)
anyway it doesn&#39;t matter so day one (37:58 - 38:03)
player and then I started I was like (38:01 - 38:05)
playing for like 3 months straight and (38:03 - 38:07)
then one night I just forgot and that (38:05 - 38:11)
was it I was was it that was it and I (38:07 - 38:12)
tried I tried a couple of times to come (38:11 - 38:15)
back but it&#39;s just trying to remember to (38:12 - 38:18)
set that up at night um because it&#39;s one (38:15 - 38:20)
of these things where I really even (38:18 - 38:22)
because that was like three months right (38:20 - 38:23)
like that&#39;s the ideal amount of time for (38:22 - 38:25)
creating a routine and making sure that (38:23 - 38:28)
you&#39;re actually do sticking to something (38:25 - 38:32)
I just forgot it&#39;s like yeah uh so being (38:28 - 38:33)
able to actually use because I I wear my (38:32 - 38:37)
Fitbit in night every night um and so (38:33 - 38:40)
being able to just log that is fantastic (38:37 - 38:42)
is great I love (38:40 - 38:46)
it still if on the game but so your (38:42 - 38:49)
Fitbit Hannah is Apple watch yep still (38:46 - 38:52)
using my Apple watch Still Loving It for (38:49 - 38:54)
the same reasons Al is enjoying the (38:52 - 38:56)
Fitbit not having to remember to press a (38:54 - 38:59)
button at night other than the ones I&#39;m (38:56 - 39:01)
already pressing for all my other sleep (38:59 - 39:04)
apps is really (39:01 - 39:06)
helpful uh it&#39;s funny it&#39;s funny that (39:04 - 39:08)
the the Fitbit brought you back out (39:06 - 39:11)
because the my friend who went on my La (39:08 - 39:15)
booo Journey with me is a fiit (39:11 - 39:18)
person and they were like oh I think the (39:15 - 39:19)
the fitbit&#39;s going to get me back in it (39:18 - 39:21)
was kind of the same reason like (39:19 - 39:24)
literally the same reasons as you Al of (39:21 - 39:27)
like I don&#39;t want to do it every night I (39:24 - 39:28)
just want to kind of be (39:27 - 39:31)
automated um it&#39;s just not always easy (39:28 - 39:33)
to remember something when you&#39;re trying (39:31 - 39:35)
to fall (39:33 - 39:39)
asleep yeah I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m on the pre (39:35 - 39:41)
pregame (39:39 - 39:41)
lifestyle I think I think I think for me (39:43 - 39:48)
I&#39;ve said this before but I think for me (39:46 - 39:51)
it it has helped with routine because (39:48 - 39:53)
like I&#39;ll hit the button and then I&#39;ll (39:51 - 39:55)
be like okay I&#39;m going to go brush my (39:53 - 39:56)
teeth I&#39;m going to wash my face and then (39:55 - 39:59)
when I get back and then I move it to (39:56 - 40:01)
the bed because it&#39;s been like 10 (39:59 - 40:03)
minutes doesn&#39;t take me 10 minutes to (40:01 - 40:05)
brush my teeth but you know the routine (40:03 - 40:08)
of just like getting ready for (40:05 - 40:11)
bed I think yeah I mean it&#39;s one of (40:08 - 40:12)
these things where everybody&#39;s different (40:11 - 40:15)
right I I struggle to have any sort of (40:12 - 40:17)
bedtime routine and you know I feel like (40:15 - 40:20)
it&#39;s probably a large part due to the (40:17 - 40:23)
ADHD right but it&#39;s just even even (40:20 - 40:25)
remembering to brush my teeth is (40:23 - 40:27)
sometimes difficult right like I&#39;ll be (40:25 - 40:28)
lying in bed (40:27 - 40:30)
nearly dropping off and I&#39;ll be like oh (40:28 - 40:32)
I didn&#39;t brush my teeth you know and (40:30 - 40:34)
then and then it&#39;s like the worst time (40:32 - 40:35)
the worst time to remember is when (40:34 - 40:36)
you&#39;re already in (40:35 - 40:39)
bed so yeah it&#39;s even even stuff like (40:36 - 40:42)
that that obviously I do every day I (40:39 - 40:44)
still forget half the time before (40:42 - 40:47)
remembering later (40:44 - 40:47)
on uh well you&#39;ll have to remember (40:48 - 40:54)
playing Pokemon sleep on October (40:51 - 40:57)
28th uh cuz mimiku will make its debut (40:54 - 40:58)
it will appear at Green Grass and the (40:57 - 41:01)
old gold power (40:58 - 41:05)
plant mimikyu is the dozing type uh and (41:01 - 41:07)
then it will have a brand new main skill (41:05 - 41:09)
which is called disguise Berry burst it (41:07 - 41:11)
will get a set amount of berries plus a (41:09 - 41:13)
few berries from other Pokemon on your (41:11 - 41:16)
team to collect on rare occasion you&#39;ll (41:13 - 41:17)
get a great success and receive a (41:16 - 41:19)
greater number of (41:17 - 41:22)
berries although it is saying after a (41:19 - 41:25)
great success no more great successes (41:22 - 41:27)
will occur until the next sleep research (41:25 - 41:30)
or manual sleep data entry so you can (41:27 - 41:34)
only really do it once a day um but that (41:30 - 41:36)
will be October 28th so in about a week (41:34 - 41:38)
of this (41:36 - 41:41)
podcast and the (41:38 - 41:45)
event will also start on October 28th uh (41:41 - 41:47)
but even though it said that mimiq will (41:45 - 41:50)
appear on green grass or old Power Plant (41:47 - 41:53)
this event is only on green (41:50 - 41:56)
grass uh (41:53 - 41:59)
so sure I guess uh certain Pokemon are (41:56 - 42:01)
more likely to appear each time a ghost (41:59 - 42:02)
type Pokemon helper brings you an (42:01 - 42:05)
ingredient it will have one extra the (42:02 - 42:08)
chance of Ghost type help our Pokemon (42:05 - 42:10)
main skill be triggered by (42:08 - 42:13)
1.5 main skills of Ghost type Pokemon (42:10 - 42:15)
are boosted by one this is actually (42:13 - 42:18)
really similar to like a legendary event (42:15 - 42:20)
yeah I was about to say that it&#39;s very (42:18 - 42:23)
similar to what we&#39;ve seen the legendary (42:20 - 42:24)
events (42:23 - 42:27)
become uh Snorlax will have in the event (42:24 - 42:30)
area will have B bluck berries which are (42:27 - 42:32)
the Ghost type berries the other two (42:30 - 42:33)
will be (42:32 - 42:36)
random many different sleep Pokemon will (42:33 - 42:38)
appear regardless of sleep type (42:36 - 42:40)
researchers will gain three times the (42:38 - 42:42)
usual number of candies for the first (42:40 - 42:45)
sleep of the day researchers will gain (42:42 - 42:48)
two times the number two times the usual (42:45 - 42:51)
number of candies for the first sleep of (42:48 - 42:55)
the day oh sorry sorry for for (42:51 - 42:58)
Halloween and the day and the last day (42:55 - 43:00)
you will get three times for the other (42:58 - 43:02)
days you will get two (43:00 - 43:04)
times you will have a greater appearance (43:02 - 43:07)
of Pikachu wearing a Halloween hat and (43:04 - 43:10)
mimiq uh then a great appearance of (43:07 - 43:12)
Gastly Haunter Gengar Shuppet Banette (43:10 - 43:16)
drifloon driam and skele (43:12 - 43:19)
durge and the Pikachu will be wearing a (43:16 - 43:24)
new hat which will be a purple hat last (43:19 - 43:28)
year&#39;s Pikachu was an orange hat (43:24 - 43:29)
by I mean orange and purple it&#39;s just (43:28 - 43:33)
the stripe on the hat amazing it&#39;s the (43:29 - 43:34)
same (43:33 - 43:38)
hat the stripe is different they&#39;re not (43:34 - 43:39)
very invested in the hats and I&#39;m kind (43:38 - 43:42)
of happy about (43:39 - 43:48)
that I love hats I love the the Pikachu (43:42 - 43:51)
hat wait have you ever do you have the (43:48 - 43:53)
Pikachu with the hat on your team I love (43:51 - 43:58)
the Pikachu hats in Pokemon go (43:53 - 43:58)
I&#39;ve corrected myself (43:58 - 44:01)
there two times uh yeah um it&#39;s cool (44:04 - 44:12)
that they&#39;re doing like the legendary (44:09 - 44:15)
kind of bonuses of like the main skill (44:12 - 44:17)
and the multipliers and the the (44:15 - 44:18)
guaranteed (44:17 - 44:21)
Barry I just read all the Ghost Pokemon (44:18 - 44:24)
there are not a lot no there aren&#39;t you (44:21 - 44:27)
have the Gengar line the banet line the (44:24 - 44:30)
drift Blum line which is still very new (44:27 - 44:34)
and then you just have skele durge (44:30 - 44:36)
yep (44:34 - 44:39)
uh I don&#39;t have a good skeler I don&#39;t I (44:36 - 44:42)
I have yet to find a good F Coco I might (44:39 - 44:45)
have one but again I don&#39;t sort my (44:42 - 44:48)
Pokemon in Pokemon sleep so I could have (44:45 - 44:51)
three I could have zero I have like 300 (44:48 - 44:53)
Pokemon in there I&#39;m going to start a (44:51 - 44:55)
new business where you can purchase my (44:53 - 44:58)
services of me cleaning out your Pokemon (44:55 - 45:00)
sleeve storage and telling you which (44:58 - 45:02)
ones to evolve and not I&#39;m good at (45:00 - 45:04)
telling which ones are really good and (45:02 - 45:06)
which ones are really bad but when there (45:04 - 45:08)
is a Pokemon that I don&#39;t have a really (45:06 - 45:11)
good version of telling which one is (45:08 - 45:13)
better in the kind of mid tiers is (45:11 - 45:17)
really difficult in this game (45:13 - 45:17)
yeah so Al you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re now (45:17 - 45:23)
playing every day because of the Fitbit (45:20 - 45:26)
I mostly I will sometime I will some (45:23 - 45:28)
days still forget actually do the (45:26 - 45:30)
research and then do two the next day (45:28 - 45:31)
but at least it&#39;s logging it that&#39;s the (45:30 - 45:35)
important thing um I yeah I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m (45:31 - 45:37)
really bad at sorting out my Pokemon as (45:35 - 45:39)
well thankfully because of how little (45:37 - 45:40)
I&#39;ve been playing the game other than (45:39 - 45:43)
the first three months I haven&#39;t hit the (45:40 - 45:47)
cap of Pokemon yet so wow um yeah (45:43 - 45:50)
without buying more bag space uh I think (45:47 - 45:52)
I bought one so I&#39;m at (45:50 - 45:57)
120 okay uh but yeah I mean I have trans (45:52 - 45:59)
a few of them I went (45:57 - 46:01)
through it&#39;s one of these things where (45:59 - 46:03)
you go right it&#39;s time to organize (46:01 - 46:04)
everything and you go through and I (46:03 - 46:06)
organize I like I I go into the sleep (46:04 - 46:08)
calculator and I do 10 of them and then (46:06 - 46:11)
I get completely bored out of my nut and (46:08 - 46:14)
just close it down but I&#39;ve transferred (46:11 - 46:15)
the ones that are the lower ones and I (46:14 - 46:20)
keep the best one um yeah I it&#39;s one of (46:15 - 46:25)
these things where I suspect I the same (46:20 - 46:27)
complexity I am fine Within go in (46:25 - 46:30)
Pokémon go purely because it&#39;s just part (46:27 - 46:33)
of my everyday life all the time now (46:30 - 46:35)
right like there&#39;s not a day I don&#39;t (46:33 - 46:39)
spend like two hours playing Pokémon go (46:35 - 46:42)
um whereas with sleep I just never got (46:39 - 46:44)
to that point so it&#39;s the complexity in (46:42 - 46:46)
the same level just (46:44 - 46:49)
becomes a chore rather than something (46:46 - 46:53)
you do as part of the game you know (46:49 - 46:55)
mhm I&#39;ve found because I think that Al (46:53 - 46:57)
you and I have some of the same issues (46:55 - 46:59)
with keeping with staying consistent (46:57 - 47:01)
with the game and all of that and not (46:59 - 47:03)
being as invested in it as say Pokémon (47:01 - 47:06)
go um I have found that once you get a (47:03 - 47:10)
good solid team that is kind of all (47:06 - 47:14)
around solid at supporting any (47:10 - 47:17)
Island it is very very helpful to have (47:14 - 47:19)
that and be able to just stick with that (47:17 - 47:21)
so that if you don&#39;t feel like you want (47:19 - 47:24)
to make a new team to start a new week (47:21 - 47:26)
you know that you have a team to fall (47:24 - 47:29)
back on what I&#39;ve been doing recently is (47:26 - 47:31)
is just going into the list and (47:29 - 47:33)
selecting the ones that have the berries (47:31 - 47:35)
that Snorlax likes and then because then (47:33 - 47:36)
it means if I&#39;m not playing the game (47:35 - 47:37)
much I still get that you know the (47:36 - 47:41)
sneaky snacking I see so yeah I I think (47:37 - 47:43)
that&#39;s been my focus and it&#39;s been much (47:41 - 47:46)
better not to like overthink these (47:43 - 47:47)
things and be like (47:46 - 47:50)
well yeah because as soon as I start (47:47 - 47:51)
thinking about the other things like oh (47:50 - 47:52)
I need to figure out what meals I want (47:51 - 47:55)
and it just I just get tired and I close (47:52 - 47:58)
the game you know (47:55 - 48:01)
it&#39;s like I just want to collect Pokemon (47:58 - 48:05)
that&#39;s I&#39;m at the point where because (48:01 - 48:07)
we&#39;re we&#39;re pretty much done with the (48:05 - 48:11)
power plant debut or whatever where (48:07 - 48:15)
Grubb and shins and Aon or more boosted (48:11 - 48:20)
for the the the two weeks and when I (48:15 - 48:22)
went to (48:20 - 48:25)
delete uh last after last week&#39;s podcast (48:22 - 48:29)
I deleted like 24 Pokemon so in that one (48:25 - 48:31)
week I caught 24 Pokemon the the shines (48:29 - 48:33)
and like that&#39;s a lot that&#39;s a lot most (48:31 - 48:34)
people just catch like one Pokemon a (48:33 - 48:37)
night but I like stocked up on on on (48:34 - 48:39)
biscuits and I had the good camp ticket (48:37 - 48:41)
and I was like I&#39;m going to catch every (48:39 - 48:45)
grubbing shins and Aon I see uh and (48:41 - 48:51)
throwing away 22 23 however many Pokemon (48:45 - 48:54)
was frustrating of like none of these (48:51 - 48:58)
are even remotely good and if it was (48:54 - 48:59)
like like oh like they&#39;re all ingredient (48:58 - 49:02)
Pokémon so like if I even if I got uh (48:59 - 49:05)
like a shins that was you know (49:02 - 49:07)
ingredient medium and helping speed up (49:05 - 49:10)
or something like I would have kept (49:07 - 49:14)
it but none of them fit anything good (49:10 - 49:17)
like it was all like ingredient down or (49:14 - 49:20)
speed of help down or just like none of (49:17 - 49:23)
these are even be Pokemon for me like I (49:20 - 49:25)
have no problem leveling a b (49:23 - 49:29)
Pokemon or like a like an A minus or (49:25 - 49:30)
something right like they don&#39;t need to (49:29 - 49:32)
be perfect s tier Pokemon for me to (49:30 - 49:35)
level it up uh but I just got (49:32 - 49:38)
unfortunately unlucky with there&#39;s just (49:35 - 49:41)
everything uh and this past week no good (49:38 - 49:43)
camp ticket but kind of the same thing I (49:41 - 49:46)
think probably caught like 12 Pokemon (49:43 - 49:50)
and still nothing good so I don&#39;t know (49:46 - 49:53)
it&#39;s (49:50 - 49:56)
uh it&#39;s like it I have a goal to work (49:53 - 49:58)
towards (49:56 - 50:00)
but going two weeks without getting like (49:58 - 50:03)
one of the three in a decent way is is (50:00 - 50:05)
is a bit like I I totally understand why (50:03 - 50:07)
people were like I wish they would (50:05 - 50:08)
introduce (50:07 - 50:10)
mints but I I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t even have (50:08 - 50:12)
any of those Pokemon that was like oh a (50:10 - 50:15)
mint would save this I was like no this (50:12 - 50:16)
I don&#39;t know if a mint would save this I (50:15 - 50:19)
do wish they would introduce mints but (50:16 - 50:21)
there&#39;s not a mechanic in Pokemon sleep (50:19 - 50:24)
like there is in Pokémon go where (50:21 - 50:26)
finding a Pokemon in a certain way like (50:24 - 50:28)
through or through hatching an egg will (50:26 - 50:32)
get you a guaranteed better Pokemon you (50:28 - 50:34)
just don&#39;t have that in Pokemon sleep (50:32 - 50:37)
yeah so Steve you&#39;re here looking for (50:34 - 50:41)
basically what is 80% to 100% Pokemon in (50:37 - 50:43)
Pokemon go but you don&#39;t have the (50:41 - 50:45)
mechanic where you can do a raid to get (50:43 - 50:47)
that almost pretty much (50:45 - 50:49)
guaranteed oh I see what you&#39;re saying (50:47 - 50:52)
yeah yeah rolling it fresh every single (50:49 - 50:56)
time and more likely than not you&#39;re (50:52 - 50:58)
going to get a bad Pokémon (50:56 - 51:00)
I think I think there&#39;s also a thing (50:58 - 51:03)
where in with Pokémon go even if you (51:00 - 51:05)
don&#39;t have a good Pokemon because it&#39;s (51:03 - 51:08)
primarily a collection game you&#39;re (51:05 - 51:11)
you&#39;re fine with that right and it (51:08 - 51:13)
people play Pokémon go different ways (51:11 - 51:15)
some people want hundreds hundos of (51:13 - 51:18)
every single no I&#39;m not I&#39;m not I&#39;m not (51:15 - 51:20)
saying they don&#39;t but I feel like the (51:18 - 51:23)
way that it&#39;s designed is the point is (51:20 - 51:26)
to collect as many Pokémon as possible (51:23 - 51:28)
whereas the point in sleep is much more (51:26 - 51:31)
curated than that right you can&#39;t just (51:28 - 51:33)
go out you can&#39;t like if I want to go (51:31 - 51:35)
catch Pokemon just now and sleep I can&#39;t (51:33 - 51:37)
if I want to go catch Pokemon and go I (51:35 - 51:39)
can&#39;t you can always be getting more (51:37 - 51:41)
Pokemon and go whereas in sleep you are (51:39 - 51:45)
limited to two sessions a day if you nap (51:41 - 51:47)
right and so that&#39;s the kind of a (51:45 - 51:50)
because of that you&#39;re less likely (51:47 - 51:54)
to give this Pokemon a pass well I am (51:50 - 51:56)
I&#39;m less likely to give a Pokemon a pass (51:54 - 51:57)
because it&#39;s a a bad Pokemon because (51:56 - 51:59)
it&#39;s like everything has to (51:57 - 52:02)
be they&#39;re all they all have to justify (51:59 - 52:03)
their (52:02 - 52:06)
existence because this is this is a game (52:03 - 52:09)
where the the Pokemon are give a (52:06 - 52:11)
restricted resource yeah they&#39;re they&#39;re (52:09 - 52:13)
restricted resource but it&#39;s also that (52:11 - 52:15)
you use them to catch more Pokemon right (52:13 - 52:16)
like you can&#39;t get the good Pokemon (52:15 - 52:18)
unless you have good Pokemon giving you (52:16 - 52:20)
the stuff whereas in go if I don&#39;t have (52:18 - 52:23)
any Pokemon I can still (52:20 - 52:25)
get good Pokemon of some kinds obviously (52:23 - 52:27)
you can&#39;t do raids and stuff although (52:25 - 52:29)
even in that situation you still could (52:27 - 52:32)
if you have other people to to work with (52:29 - 52:37)
so yeah I think I think the other thing (52:32 - 52:39)
about (52:37 - 52:42)
um poke like like the thing about sleep (52:39 - 52:48)
is I once you get a a minus A+ whatever (52:42 - 52:49)
Pokemon once you get a Pokemon that&#39;s (52:48 - 52:52)
good enough you kind of can ignore every (52:49 - 52:55)
future Pokemon right like I have a (52:52 - 52:57)
really good Venusaur a really good (52:55 - 52:59)
Charizard and a really good Blastoise (52:57 - 53:02)
are they like s tier no but like I think (52:59 - 53:05)
I would they&#39;re probably like a minus or (53:02 - 53:07)
a all of them and they they have the (53:05 - 53:09)
candy investment I&#39;m out of Venusaur (53:07 - 53:12)
candy I&#39;m out of Charizard candy like (53:09 - 53:14)
even if I had the candy the dream Shard (53:12 - 53:18)
cost would be so expensive that I would (53:14 - 53:20)
like I have no reason to start over I (53:18 - 53:22)
don&#39;t need to catch another Squirtle to (53:20 - 53:23)
be like maybe the Squirtle will be (53:22 - 53:26)
better because my blasto is already (53:23 - 53:27)
really good (53:26 - 53:32)
uh so in sleep there is this once I get (53:27 - 53:34)
the Godlike (53:32 - 53:37)
grubbin I kind of don&#39;t have to worry (53:34 - 53:39)
like I could catch grubbin for more (53:37 - 53:41)
candy but I don&#39;t have to like wake up (53:39 - 53:43)
being like man I hope I get a grubbin (53:41 - 53:44)
and I hope if I I hope it&#39;s hungry and I (53:43 - 53:46)
hope I catch it and I hope it&#39;s better (53:44 - 53:49)
than what I have sleep has this just (53:46 - 53:51)
kind of I don&#39;t know core comp concept (53:49 - 53:56)
of like once I have the good one I don&#39;t (53:51 - 53:59)
need any anymore and it takes so long to (53:56 - 54:01)
get a good one you could maybe apply (53:59 - 54:04)
that for Pokemon go you can&#39;t apply it (54:01 - 54:06)
for Pokemon go but the barrier to catch (54:04 - 54:09)
a Pokemon is much smaller so and the (54:06 - 54:11)
barrier to power one up to a certain (54:09 - 54:13)
extent yeah but it&#39;s like if you if you (54:11 - 54:16)
see a one in the wild in Pokémon go and (54:13 - 54:18)
you&#39;re playing Pokémon go you&#39;re not (54:16 - 54:21)
going to go oh I have 100% Charizard I&#39;m (54:18 - 54:22)
not going to bother catching that (54:21 - 54:24)
Charmander if you like catching Pokemon (54:22 - 54:25)
you&#39;re going to you&#39;re going to do that (54:24 - 54:27)
oh you&#39;re yeah you&#39;re catch it yeah (54:25 - 54:28)
whereas in sleep you&#39;re like am I going (54:27 - 54:31)
to use one of my biscuits on (54:28 - 54:34)
this right and I in my in my video that (54:31 - 54:36)
I did I talked about how the biscuit was (54:34 - 54:39)
such a rare (54:36 - 54:43)
resource uh and I think if you were just (54:39 - 54:44)
playing Pokémon go you&#39;re just like oh (54:43 - 54:46)
pokeballs are just pokeballs like I&#39;ll (54:44 - 54:48)
just spin stops and get more and there&#39;s (54:46 - 54:50)
like there&#39;s really no way to get more (54:48 - 54:53)
biscuits without buying them I mean you (54:50 - 54:56)
get your free biscuit every day but um (54:53 - 54:59)
not like they&#39;re just the Poke biscuits (54:56 - 55:01)
uh like I did buy the I mean I had free (54:59 - 55:03)
gems but I did buy like the the first (55:01 - 55:06)
bundle and then the second bundle and if (55:03 - 55:07)
I used real money that would have been (55:06 - 55:09)
like (55:07 - 55:11)
$20 for it for (55:09 - 55:14)
that the other thing where I feel like (55:11 - 55:17)
Pokemon go I&#39;m not saying Pokemon go is (55:14 - 55:19)
better I&#39;m just saying they&#39;re different (55:17 - 55:21)
in the games is like I saw a lot of (55:19 - 55:23)
people in regards to like Max raid (55:21 - 55:28)
battles be like why would I do this why (55:23 - 55:33)
would I catch a Max a Dynamax Bulbasaur (55:28 - 55:36)
to then power it up to then know that (55:33 - 55:39)
gigantamax Venusaur is coming out or why (55:36 - 55:42)
would I do a Dynamax sore bunny when I (55:39 - 55:44)
know that eventually a shiny sore bunny (55:42 - 55:45)
will come out and then I know eventually (55:44 - 55:47)
a shiny score bunny that will be able to (55:45 - 55:51)
gigant Max to um cinderace will come out (55:47 - 55:54)
which are fair (55:51 - 55:57)
complaints or Fair reservations to have (55:54 - 55:59)
but I think unlike Pokemon sleep in (55:57 - 56:04)
Pokemon go those tools still are tools (55:59 - 56:09)
right like I have two different (56:04 - 56:13)
Charizards that are 2500 CP that are max (56:09 - 56:17)
level two whatever Dynamite Max flare or (56:13 - 56:19)
Max Airstream but one is Max Airstream (56:17 - 56:21)
and one is Max flare so they&#39;re doing (56:19 - 56:24)
different things they&#39;re easy to power (56:21 - 56:26)
up because Charmander has been in the (56:24 - 56:27)
game for eight (56:26 - 56:30)
ears like so most people who have been (56:27 - 56:32)
playing for a long time have enough (56:30 - 56:36)
candy to power them up and raids involve (56:32 - 56:39)
three Pokemon so I can do Charizard (56:36 - 56:41)
Charizard and something else and then I (56:39 - 56:42)
can do a (56:41 - 56:45)
failings and now I have a (56:42 - 56:47)
failings and I could have two fail Ines (56:45 - 56:50)
I could have one failings with (56:47 - 56:52)
Max whatever the fist one is called I (56:50 - 56:54)
can&#39;t remember Max (56:52 - 56:56)
punch uh and then like one with with (56:54 - 56:59)
like Max flutter or whatever the bug one (56:56 - 57:01)
is actually I don&#39;t know if it can get (56:59 - 57:03)
the bug one I&#39;m thinking of sword and (57:01 - 57:05)
shield uh but you know what I mean you (57:03 - 57:06)
could have two failings do different (57:05 - 57:09)
things on top of that even if for (57:06 - 57:11)
whatever reason you have three Dynamax (57:09 - 57:14)
Charizards and a gigantamax Charizard is (57:11 - 57:17)
coming out you can still leave (57:14 - 57:20)
those Dynamax Pokemon (57:17 - 57:24)
in raid dens to then get more candy and (57:20 - 57:28)
to also help out people so I so sleep is (57:24 - 57:30)
very much like I got the perfect Pokemon (57:28 - 57:32)
I never need it again but I really do (57:30 - 57:34)
think go (57:32 - 57:37)
is I can have multiple of those Pokemon (57:34 - 57:39)
because I can do more with (57:37 - 57:42)
them um and I know some people are (57:39 - 57:45)
really like hesitant on the like I&#39;m not (57:42 - 57:47)
going to H I I I&#39;ve seen like two (57:45 - 57:49)
conversations one is like three stars (57:47 - 57:50)
are too (57:49 - 57:53)
hard like (57:50 - 57:57)
failings um but one it&#39;s like well it&#39;s (57:53 - 57:59)
like a new system and we start it over (57:57 - 58:01)
and then there are some people that are (57:59 - 58:03)
like well I&#39;m not going to be able to do (58:01 - 58:07)
gigantamax because it requires 10 to 40 (58:03 - 58:09)
people which I feel like not enough (58:07 - 58:10)
people are talking about where like a (58:09 - 58:12)
current rate is only 20 people and this (58:10 - 58:17)
is saying it can hold 40 people so in my (58:12 - 58:19)
head I&#39;m thinking well if you think that (58:17 - 58:23)
failen is too hard but this is supposed (58:19 - 58:26)
to be up to 40 people does this make the (58:23 - 58:29)
failings raid significantly easy and now (58:26 - 58:32)
you have this tool going forward in the (58:29 - 58:36)
future of like gigantamax (58:32 - 58:38)
Charizard which is a tool you&#39;ll have (58:36 - 58:39)
going forward for all these Max raids (58:38 - 58:41)
and all these Dynamax raids are going to (58:39 - 58:44)
make three star raids much easier for (58:41 - 58:45)
you to (58:44 - 58:47)
solo (58:45 - 58:50)
um I don&#39;t know at the end of the day (58:47 - 58:52)
it&#39;s just a huge gameplay Loop like all (58:50 - 58:53)
games have (58:52 - 58:56)
this yeah I think that that&#39;s a fair (58:53 - 58:57)
point how ever I think if you&#39;re able to (58:56 - 58:59)
get 10 people together to do a gigant (58:57 - 59:01)
Max Charizard you&#39;re probably able to (58:59 - 59:04)
get two people together to do a failinks (59:01 - 59:05)
right (59:04 - 59:08)
like you know my my sometimes you&#39;re (59:05 - 59:09)
alone in like a parking lot and there&#39;s (59:08 - 59:11)
a failings there and you want sure sure (59:09 - 59:15)
okay right fine yeah sure it&#39;s not the (59:11 - 59:17)
most efficient way to like gather any of (59:15 - 59:20)
your resources for failings right like (59:17 - 59:23)
it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s particularly inefficient (59:20 - 59:26)
for that because it&#39;s slow like if you (59:23 - 59:27)
the moment they have another event where (59:26 - 59:29)
Felix is in the wild you can get (59:27 - 59:33)
infinitely more failing (59:29 - 59:36)
candy so quickly right so it&#39;s not like (59:33 - 59:39)
nobody&#39;s doing Dynamax raids to get (59:36 - 59:40)
failing candy to power it up like that&#39;s (59:39 - 59:42)
just such an inefficient way of (59:40 - 59:46)
doing um I think the the the problem is (59:42 - 59:48)
and it&#39;s the same problem we had with (59:46 - 59:53)
raids before remote ra remote passes and (59:48 - 59:55)
the the problem is purely just that (59:53 - 59:58)
people who are unable to get around (59:55 - 60:00)
people will just be unable to do this (59:58 - 60:03)
feature and I guess the good thing about (60:00 - 60:05)
go is that&#39;s fine you can just ignore it (60:03 - 60:08)
right like I have never done a shadow (60:05 - 60:11)
raid like I just never done I I think I (60:08 - 60:14)
tried one once and went this isn&#39;t Fun (60:11 - 60:17)
and I&#39;ve just never done it again right (60:14 - 60:20)
so and I and I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s part of (60:17 - 60:22)
the problem is Pokemon is a collection (60:20 - 60:24)
game fundamentally yes you can play it (60:22 - 60:26)
in different ways but it started out and (60:24 - 60:28)
will always have a core part of it being (60:26 - 60:30)
a collection game and that is the thing (60:28 - 60:33)
that I you know we&#39;re going to talk more (60:30 - 60:34)
about collections later on in the (60:33 - 60:37)
episode um you know that is a core thing (60:34 - 60:39)
that a lot of people like and personally (60:37 - 60:41)
that&#39;s something that I really like but (60:39 - 60:44)
that does become or it can become a (60:41 - 60:46)
little bit obsessive when you have these (60:44 - 60:49)
different ways of collecting and it&#39;s (60:46 - 60:52)
like oh do I need all of the Shadow (60:49 - 60:54)
Pokémon and all of the normal Pokemon (60:52 - 60:57)
and all of the Dynamax (60:54 - 60:59)
or is it okay for me to just go I&#39;m just (60:57 - 61:01)
going to ignore that and just continue (60:59 - 61:03)
doing the things I&#39;m actually enjoying (61:01 - 61:06)
which is sometimes a hard thing to (61:03 - 61:10)
accept personally right (61:06 - 61:12)
like but the fact that I did it with (61:10 - 61:14)
Shadow raids means that if I&#39;m not (61:12 - 61:16)
enjoying Dynamax raids and if you (61:14 - 61:18)
literally can&#39;t do them because you (61:16 - 61:20)
don&#39;t have the people well that&#39;s the (61:18 - 61:22)
thing and it&#39;s it is another thing of (61:20 - 61:26)
like if I put in the time you know on an (61:22 - 61:28)
evening during the weekdays could I (61:26 - 61:31)
drive into Edinburgh and find people (61:28 - 61:33)
probably but that&#39;s a lot of effort you (61:31 - 61:35)
know especially for someone who you know (61:33 - 61:37)
has kids I don&#39;t want to go out in the (61:35 - 61:40)
evenings on a weekday I want to want to (61:37 - 61:43)
go to bed you know so it&#39;s it&#39;s (61:40 - 61:45)
complicated but I think sometimes you (61:43 - 61:47)
just need to accept that sometimes (61:45 - 61:50)
you&#39;re not going to do every part of the (61:47 - 61:50)
game yeah I mean like I I do feel like (61:51 - 61:57)
I&#39;m in such this weird minority like (61:54 - 61:58)
like there so many people complain about (61:57 - 62:00)
so many things in Pokémon go I like get (61:58 - 62:03)
it right like you&#39;re just so used to it (62:00 - 62:05)
but like I feel like I&#39;m in such a weird (62:03 - 62:08)
minority because I genuinely like how (62:05 - 62:11)
Niantic has done the Dynamax stuff which (62:08 - 62:13)
if this is your first time listen this (62:11 - 62:17)
podcast I am very critical of (62:13 - 62:20)
N I have been for eight years I have (62:17 - 62:23)
been incredibly critical of this company (62:20 - 62:24)
and sometimes they bring me out to (62:23 - 62:27)
events and sometimes they pay for travel (62:24 - 62:30)
uh but I I know I am not a favorite at (62:27 - 62:34)
Niantic as that company is so I know I (62:30 - 62:37)
am not one of their favorites um and (62:34 - 62:39)
that&#39;s fine because I will I will always (62:37 - 62:41)
I will always lean into my honesty about (62:39 - 62:43)
these events and how I feel about them (62:41 - 62:45)
and you know even with the Stellar maze (62:43 - 62:47)
I&#39;m like it was okay because in reality (62:45 - 62:50)
it it was just okay like it was it was (62:47 - 62:52)
cool and I think for a free event it was (62:50 - 62:54)
it was okay like I don&#39;t think (62:52 - 62:57)
like Pokemon putting me on a plane and (62:54 - 62:58)
bringing me out there has swayed my (62:57 - 63:01)
opinion to be like oh my gosh like (62:58 - 63:03)
Hannah you really missed out on this (63:01 - 63:06)
mirr like it was Crystal Clean like (63:03 - 63:07)
would it be would Hannah have a good (63:06 - 63:10)
time if she was there yeah sure but (63:07 - 63:13)
like it was an okay event uh but I I (63:10 - 63:17)
genuinely like the (63:13 - 63:19)
Dynamax (63:17 - 63:21)
thing (63:19 - 63:23)
um like (63:21 - 63:26)
I I liked like when I was at the air (63:23 - 63:29)
yesterday I did three I did three raids (63:26 - 63:31)
didn&#39;t need anyone they were super easy (63:29 - 63:32)
I was able to like roll to see if they (63:31 - 63:34)
were slightly better didn&#39;t cost me any (63:32 - 63:36)
money and then when I was done with (63:34 - 63:38)
those three raids I spun them all got my (63:36 - 63:40)
points did my little walking thing got (63:38 - 63:42)
my points and now I&#39;m I&#39;m back at a th (63:40 - 63:45)
and today I can do another three raids (63:42 - 63:47)
and (63:45 - 63:51)
like I can do failing solo I could do (63:47 - 63:54)
matens uh yeah it was Beldum I could do (63:51 - 63:57)
Beldum solo and all I did was I just (63:54 - 63:59)
took two charmanders that were (63:57 - 64:01)
relatively decent I got them to 2500 CP (63:59 - 64:04)
I leveled up their Max move once and (64:01 - 64:06)
then the third Pokemon was just a filler (64:04 - 64:08)
Pokemon that I would swap in so I could (64:06 - 64:11)
just like gain Max things is it slow yes (64:08 - 64:14)
could I level up a third Pokemon to 2500 (64:11 - 64:19)
and would it be easier yes (64:14 - 64:19)
um but like I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know I like (64:19 - 64:25)
it a lot um and I haven&#39;t spent any (64:22 - 64:27)
money on it (64:25 - 64:31)
but like for this weekend that is the (64:27 - 64:34)
Dynamax Venusaur or sorry gigantamax (64:31 - 64:36)
Venus or Blastoise and Charizard I will (64:34 - 64:38)
probably spend money because I&#39;m going (64:36 - 64:40)
to I&#39;ll go to the mall America I know (64:38 - 64:42)
there will be people playing Pokemon (64:40 - 64:44)
there because it&#39;s m America and I&#39;ll be (64:42 - 64:47)
able to do what like two for (64:44 - 64:50)
free and then I don&#39;t know I&#39;ll I&#39;ll (64:47 - 64:53)
spend like 10 bucks and I&#39;ll do another (64:50 - 64:56)
five six raids and I&#39;ll probably never (64:53 - 64:57)
have to do them (64:56 - 65:00)
again and then I&#39;ll have gigantamax (64:57 - 65:02)
Venusaur Blastoise and Charizard going (65:00 - 65:05)
forward for more raids yeah like (65:02 - 65:09)
eventually they&#39;re going to release (65:05 - 65:12)
eternus and eternus will be featured in (65:09 - 65:14)
this and eternus will probably be the (65:12 - 65:16)
hardest one out of all of them and I&#39;ll (65:14 - 65:21)
have the resources for it yeah I think I (65:16 - 65:22)
I I mean personally I think there&#39;s (65:21 - 65:24)
there are a lot of good things about (65:22 - 65:25)
Dynamax so I&#39;m not going to say it&#39;s (65:24 - 65:27)
like purely (65:25 - 65:29)
right like if if you even think of like (65:27 - 65:30)
the fact (65:29 - 65:34)
that I have my issues with the limits on (65:30 - 65:37)
the max particles but if you compare it (65:34 - 65:40)
to raids you get more free for the (65:37 - 65:42)
Dynamax than you do for the (65:40 - 65:45)
rat I think part of the issue is that (65:42 - 65:48)
you&#39;re using the same currency to do the (65:45 - 65:51)
battles as you are to power up the (65:48 - 65:54)
Pokemon with the max moves um which is (65:51 - 65:57)
obviously a bit of an issue but (65:54 - 65:58)
if you once you get as you say like (65:57 - 66:00)
that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of a limited time (65:58 - 66:01)
thing like I spent the first week of (66:00 - 66:03)
Dynamax like going out and doing (66:01 - 66:04)
everything I possibly could and like (66:03 - 66:07)
powering them all up um funnily enough (66:04 - 66:08)
when I could actually do it myself I was (66:07 - 66:10)
enjoying it (66:08 - 66:14)
but you know you can do easily if you&#39;re (66:10 - 66:15)
want if you&#39;re wanting to do the onear (66:14 - 66:18)
ones you can easily do three or four in (66:15 - 66:19)
a day and you can probably do more if (66:18 - 66:21)
you didn&#39;t do any the day before or (66:19 - 66:23)
something like that right whereas with (66:21 - 66:26)
raids you get if you haven&#39;t done one (66:23 - 66:27)
before and you have your pass you can do (66:26 - 66:32)
two um and that&#39;s only if you&#39;re in that (66:27 - 66:34)
situation and I think this is the one (66:32 - 66:36)
thing I complained about for what seven (66:34 - 66:39)
years is and and it brings me back to (66:36 - 66:41)
the people who like love remote raids I (66:39 - 66:43)
get why they love remote raids I was (66:41 - 66:45)
never huge on remote raids like I would (66:43 - 66:46)
do it every now and then like if (66:45 - 66:49)
somebody invited me and well there was (66:46 - 66:51)
two thought processes one is if I got (66:49 - 66:54)
invited and there was like four people I (66:51 - 66:56)
would almost always back outz and like (66:54 - 66:58)
to me the time was more important like I (66:56 - 67:00)
just don&#39;t want to be here for the full (66:58 - 67:03)
what 3 four minutes and like maybe fail (67:00 - 67:05)
at the end but if it was 20 I&#39;d be like (67:03 - 67:07)
oh easy I don&#39;t I could bring I could (67:05 - 67:09)
bring six Pikachu&#39;s like I don&#39;t I don&#39;t (67:07 - 67:10)
even have to look at my screen it&#39;ll be (67:09 - 67:12)
done yeah (67:10 - 67:14)
but the thing that always bothered me (67:12 - 67:17)
about the current raid system was why (67:14 - 67:21)
would I spend a dollar on a one star (67:17 - 67:24)
Pikachu raid when I got so much more (67:21 - 67:28)
value spending a dollar on a five-star (67:24 - 67:31)
landeras raid like not only do I get a (67:28 - 67:34)
more rare Pokemon but I get better Shiny (67:31 - 67:36)
chances because the Pikachu isn&#39;t one in (67:34 - 67:39)
20 shiny chance the landeras is and I (67:36 - 67:41)
get way more rewards I get more rare (67:39 - 67:44)
candy more experience more uh chance of (67:41 - 67:48)
TMS or whatever like it just never made (67:44 - 67:50)
sense like I would never remote into a (67:48 - 67:53)
one uh a one star or a three star raid (67:50 - 67:56)
ever cuz the like maybe I will remote (67:53 - 67:58)
into a festar raid but never a one and (67:56 - 68:00)
two star raid um and even with my free (67:58 - 68:01)
raid pass I would never use it because (68:00 - 68:04)
it was like I could use it here on this (68:01 - 68:09)
like Mankey but then what if what if I&#39;m (68:04 - 68:10)
at the grocery store and all of a sudden (68:09 - 68:13)
like five people jump into a landeras (68:10 - 68:15)
now it&#39;s like (68:13 - 68:18)
ah system is so much better because I (68:15 - 68:22)
can just I can do four onear raids or I (68:18 - 68:24)
can do like two three star raids and it (68:22 - 68:27)
just feel I don&#39;t know to me it&#39;s just (68:24 - 68:30)
like this is a way better system and (68:27 - 68:31)
seeing so many people being like I hate (68:30 - 68:34)
this I I do yeah so I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s (68:31 - 68:35)
that&#39;s the thing I think that is best (68:34 - 68:37)
about it I think that is a really good (68:35 - 68:39)
change but as I say I&#39;m not a huge fan (68:37 - 68:41)
of how they then combine the max (68:39 - 68:43)
particles as two things it&#39;s both the (68:41 - 68:46)
cost for the raid itself but also you (68:43 - 68:48)
have to use it to power up the Pokemon (68:46 - 68:52)
to get it and then you also then this is (68:48 - 68:55)
this is my real issue with with Dynamax (68:52 - 68:59)
is that you have have to use like four (68:55 - 69:01)
different currencies to power up your (68:59 - 69:05)
Pokemon for Dynamax right so I I think (69:01 - 69:07)
it would be a lot better if it just (69:05 - 69:10)
focused on the max particles and you&#39;re (69:07 - 69:12)
the P you know the the standard level of (69:10 - 69:13)
your Pokemon didn&#39;t affect how the (69:12 - 69:16)
battle was going um I understand why it (69:13 - 69:17)
does because of how they&#39;ve done things (69:16 - 69:19)
right you&#39;re in your normal mode until (69:17 - 69:22)
you Dynamax but I I suspect that would (69:19 - 69:24)
remove a lot of the issues that people (69:22 - 69:28)
have purely because it&#39;s like (69:24 - 69:28)
Stardust depending on how you play the (69:28 - 69:32)
game Stardust can be really hard to come (69:30 - 69:36)
by um and I will accept that a lot of (69:32 - 69:38)
this is my own making because I like to (69:36 - 69:40)
power up Pokemon purely to have a bigger (69:38 - 69:42)
number and I know that&#39;s a problem but (69:40 - 69:44)
I&#39;ve been doing it for eight years right (69:42 - 69:46)
and it&#39;s hard to you know I can&#39;t change (69:44 - 69:49)
the past I can&#39;t suddenly have the 10 (69:46 - 69:52)
million Stardust that I spent on things (69:49 - 69:55)
um but combining that with the fact that (69:52 - 69:56)
Stardust is used for so many different (69:55 - 69:57)
things it&#39;s used for powering up Pokemon (69:56 - 70:00)
it&#39;s used for trades you know and you (69:57 - 70:01)
have to you know use it for both your (70:00 - 70:04)
raid Pokemon and your Dynamax Pokemon (70:01 - 70:07)
but I guess my point is like it&#39;s it&#39;s (70:04 - 70:08)
there are definitely good things and (70:07 - 70:10)
there are definitely bad things and I (70:08 - 70:12)
think we would all be very surprised if (70:10 - 70:15)
this is exactly the same in a year um (70:12 - 70:18)
yeah we&#39;ll see how things go with it but (70:15 - 70:21)
yeah I&#39;m not I&#39;m not I&#39;ve not I&#39;ve still (70:18 - 70:22)
not done a feelings right because I&#39;ve (70:21 - 70:25)
I&#39;ve just I&#39;ve never been at a place (70:22 - 70:28)
where there&#39;s two people go and I don&#39;t (70:25 - 70:30)
part of my problem is that I stopped (70:28 - 70:32)
catching Charmander at one point so I (70:30 - 70:33)
just don&#39;t have the candy to power up a (70:32 - 70:37)
second Charizard how dare you I know I (70:33 - 70:39)
know (70:37 - 70:42)
um I also think it would be better if (70:39 - 70:44)
like there had an event going where you (70:42 - 70:45)
could catch Charmander in the wild to (70:44 - 70:47)
get the candy to power up your Pokemon (70:45 - 70:50)
to get the anyway what wor I&#39;m sure (70:47 - 70:52)
there will be another the the third (70:50 - 70:54)
annual classic Charmander Community (70:52 - 70:57)
absolutely Ely and then how long to wait (70:54 - 70:58)
till failing is back around in the (70:57 - 71:00)
Dynamax rates it&#39;s just one of these (70:58 - 71:02)
problems where it&#39;s like I like to (71:00 - 71:04)
minmax things and that&#39;s a problem when (71:02 - 71:06)
you don&#39;t have everything you want and (71:04 - 71:08)
that&#39;s a me problem when it&#39;s still yeah (71:06 - 71:09)
when it&#39;s still a fairly new feature and (71:08 - 71:12)
you don&#39;t have the Pokemon that you can (71:09 - 71:13)
use and that&#39;s one of the things that I (71:12 - 71:16)
know they were optimizing for in raid (71:13 - 71:18)
battles because they would often have (71:16 - 71:20)
Pokemon in three star raids that you (71:18 - 71:21)
could use specifically to counter the (71:20 - 71:23)
Pokemon that were in five star rid so (71:21 - 71:25)
even if you&#39;re a relatively new player (71:23 - 71:28)
without that collection you could still (71:25 - 71:31)
get the Pokemon that you might need to (71:28 - 71:32)
help take down the five stars and I (71:31 - 71:34)
don&#39;t think they&#39;ve done that with the (71:32 - 71:35)
Dynamax quite (71:34 - 71:37)
yet uh I mean I guess you would you (71:35 - 71:39)
would do the charmanders like I prepped (71:37 - 71:41)
on Charmander to (71:39 - 71:43)
get (71:41 - 71:46)
Beldum yes and then Beldum and (71:43 - 71:49)
Charmander are both good against (71:46 - 71:51)
failinks although F then you need to (71:49 - 71:54)
have been playing it that whole time (71:51 - 71:55)
yeah yeah yeah yeah the thing with the (71:54 - 71:56)
five star and the three star matching up (71:55 - 71:58)
is that those are available at the same (71:56 - 72:02)
time yeah yeah yeah totally I I (71:58 - 72:05)
do I think about when Pokémon go was (72:02 - 72:07)
first shown and I (72:05 - 72:10)
think everyone remembers to this day (72:07 - 72:12)
even if they don&#39;t play Pokemon go they (72:10 - 72:15)
remember Mewtwo appearing in Time Square (72:12 - 72:18)
and they see all of these trainers and (72:15 - 72:21)
that has never really happened there was (72:18 - 72:24)
an event in Japan where they rented out (72:21 - 72:26)
a baseball stadium and they had three (72:24 - 72:28)
gyms and that was when Mewtwo originally (72:26 - 72:30)
debuted and the people in the stadium (72:28 - 72:35)
could do it and that was cool but I do (72:30 - 72:37)
think Niantic deserves a little bit of (72:35 - 72:41)
credit for what I think is what they&#39;re (72:37 - 72:43)
laying this foundation for which are (72:41 - 72:45)
these big (72:43 - 72:48)
events where they&#39;re Gathering all these (72:45 - 72:50)
people (72:48 - 72:53)
because for gigant X Charizard Blastoise (72:50 - 72:56)
Venusaur it is it is that weekend right (72:53 - 72:59)
they are making a big deal about the I I (72:56 - 73:01)
just did a video about this I think it&#39;s (72:59 - 73:05)
the 27th and the the 26th and the 27th (73:01 - 73:06)
they&#39;re making a big deal about that (73:05 - 73:08)
weekend right and I think they know I (73:06 - 73:10)
think they know (73:08 - 73:14)
that you know we can&#39;t always you can&#39;t (73:10 - 73:16)
always just pull up to uh a Walmart and (73:14 - 73:19)
be like ah 15 people are here to to to (73:16 - 73:21)
to do this (73:19 - 73:24)
blastway on this random like Tuesday (73:21 - 73:25)
afternoon right like that&#39;s not a (73:24 - 73:27)
reality a lot maybe unless you live in (73:25 - 73:30)
like Japan and you&#39;re at like a (73:27 - 73:32)
McDonald&#39;s or something (73:30 - 73:35)
um but I think they they know that like (73:32 - 73:38)
okay these big tent B tent pole Pokemon (73:35 - 73:41)
I&#39;m using tent pole as like gigantamax (73:38 - 73:44)
Pokemon are going to be a weekend event (73:41 - 73:46)
and people will be out that weekend to (73:44 - 73:48)
do it and that is realistically where (73:46 - 73:50)
you could get 10 plus people to do it (73:48 - 73:51)
and then it will go away and then when (73:50 - 73:53)
we bring it back and I think they were (73:51 - 73:56)
trying that I I think they were doing (73:53 - 74:00)
that a little bit with Shadow Pokemon (73:56 - 74:03)
um and I it very much reminds me of the (74:00 - 74:06)
original big Shadow raids yeah yeah and (74:03 - 74:08)
I think the only one that was like super (74:06 - 74:10)
kind of successful with that was like (74:08 - 74:13)
Mewtwo because people just love Mewtwo (74:10 - 74:17)
me brings everyone back um but I do (74:13 - 74:21)
think of like the wild area event (74:17 - 74:24)
where uh like we we&#39;re going to see (74:21 - 74:27)
gigant Max toxcity right like gigantamax (74:24 - 74:28)
tox did they announce this on the (74:27 - 74:30)
website like gigant Max I don&#39;t even (74:28 - 74:31)
know if they announced it but like (74:30 - 74:32)
there&#39;s no way that gigantamax toxcity (74:31 - 74:35)
is not at the wild area in right um like (74:32 - 74:38)
it&#39;s in the trailer yeah uh but like (74:35 - 74:41)
when you&#39;re there like if Al and I were (74:38 - 74:45)
at sin tour I&#39;m trying to think of a CNO (74:41 - 74:46)
gigantum X Pokemon I don&#39;t think there (74:45 - 74:49)
is one there probably is one let&#39;s say (74:46 - 74:52)
Al and I go to the Unova tour and (74:49 - 74:56)
gigantic Max scarbo does its debut (74:52 - 74:58)
none of this is confirmed but I&#39;m just (74:56 - 75:00)
making I&#39;m just making things up this (74:58 - 75:03)
just hypothetical (75:00 - 75:05)
scenarios Alan I go to New York in (75:03 - 75:08)
February for the the the Unova tour (75:05 - 75:11)
gigantamax gar Garbo makes its deut you (75:08 - 75:15)
need 10 to 40 people there&#39;s everyone at (75:11 - 75:17)
that event will get it hands down easy (75:15 - 75:20)
right like so it&#39;s almost like these (75:17 - 75:23)
gigantamax Pokemon are not like a (75:20 - 75:26)
landeras or are not like a Latios or (75:23 - 75:28)
whatever other legendary Pokemon they (75:26 - 75:30)
want to make it feel (75:28 - 75:34)
like more memorable or more event worthy (75:30 - 75:37)
than just like I was sitting on my couch (75:34 - 75:40)
and I got a shiny latas and I it took me (75:37 - 75:42)
$32 cuz my name is Bobby but I (75:40 - 75:45)
eventually got it right like they&#39;re (75:42 - 75:48)
they&#39;re putting the barriers to getting (75:45 - 75:51)
those Pokemon at those memorable event (75:48 - 75:53)
worthy levels but they really have to (75:51 - 75:55)
make sure they are actually getting the (75:53 - 75:57)
players interested enough to get out (75:55 - 76:00)
there and and catch them because (75:57 - 76:04)
otherwise people aren&#39;t going to be very (76:00 - 76:04)
successful yeah you could you could (76:04 - 76:08)
maybe argue that that they&#39;re doing it a (76:06 - 76:10)
little too fast but at the same time I (76:08 - 76:12)
feel like they&#39;ve been drip feeding so (76:10 - 76:14)
much that it&#39;s actually kind of crazy (76:12 - 76:17)
that they&#39;re not drip feeding this where (76:14 - 76:20)
like how how long do we need Charmander (76:17 - 76:22)
Squirtle Bulbasaur squore bunny groy (76:20 - 76:25)
sabble in raids for cuz once you get a a (76:22 - 76:27)
good one you just need maybe one or two (76:25 - 76:29)
good ones and you just power it up and (76:27 - 76:31)
now you&#39;re you&#39;re ready to go you use (76:29 - 76:34)
the the the the water starter for the (76:31 - 76:36)
fire one you use the fire starter for (76:34 - 76:37)
the grass (76:36 - 76:40)
one I don&#39;t know I again I feel like I&#39;m (76:37 - 76:42)
in the minority I feel like I genuinely (76:40 - 76:45)
think it&#39;s really great like even I was (76:42 - 76:47)
I took my one whe to Mall of America (76:45 - 76:50)
which you know I&#39;m 15 minutes in the car (76:47 - 76:52)
from All America so it&#39;s it&#39;s maybe like (76:50 - 76:55)
40 minutes on my one wheeel or a bike (76:52 - 76:56)
but but the amount of times I literally (76:55 - 76:58)
stopped and I was like oh there&#39;s (76:56 - 77:00)
there&#39;s a raid here or like I&#39;m just (76:58 - 77:02)
going to do this cuz I&#39;m I&#39;m on I&#39;m on (77:00 - 77:05)
my way and like I wouldn&#39;t do that with (77:02 - 77:07)
normal onear (77:05 - 77:09)
raids because one they cost money but (77:07 - 77:14)
two like I don&#39;t need I don&#39;t need that (77:09 - 77:16)
I don&#39;t know I no I yeah I&#39;m not (77:14 - 77:18)
disagreeing with you I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I&#39;m (77:16 - 77:20)
not saying that Dynamax is bad and you (77:18 - 77:23)
know I I it must have been two weeks or (77:20 - 77:26)
something where I was doing all the (77:23 - 77:28)
Dynamax rates because it was it wasn&#39;t I (77:26 - 77:29)
was enjoying it and the one stars were (77:28 - 77:31)
easy to do and as you say they were (77:29 - 77:33)
cheap you could easily do four or five (77:31 - 77:36)
in a day if you were doing doing it (77:33 - 77:40)
properly uh efficiently if you will (77:36 - 77:42)
um it&#39;s just one of those things with (77:40 - 77:46)
they are always trying to get people (77:42 - 77:48)
together and get people out and together (77:46 - 77:52)
and that is always going to conflict (77:48 - 77:56)
with people who are not in the either (77:52 - 78:00)
location or the social ability to get (77:56 - 78:04)
out there uh you know I have kids I (78:00 - 78:06)
can&#39;t just go out and do stuff you know (78:04 - 78:09)
it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the combination of it&#39;s (78:06 - 78:11)
like with the I forget was it the elite (78:09 - 78:13)
raids that (78:11 - 78:16)
were the newer ones or was the ex that (78:13 - 78:18)
were newer ones I lose I completely (78:16 - 78:19)
can&#39;t remember Elite is the newer ones (78:18 - 78:21)
El leite the newer ones right okay um (78:19 - 78:24)
those are were an example of the same (78:21 - 78:26)
sort of thing right it&#39;s we&#39;re trying to (78:24 - 78:29)
do these more limited things at a (78:26 - 78:32)
specific time with more time to tell you (78:29 - 78:33)
that it&#39;s happening so that people can (78:32 - 78:35)
come together but the problem is if (78:33 - 78:38)
you&#39;re busy that day you can&#39;t do it (78:35 - 78:42)
whereas uh an event where this legendary (78:38 - 78:44)
is in raids for two weeks it&#39;s harder to (78:42 - 78:46)
get people together because it&#39;s a (78:44 - 78:49)
longer period of time but there&#39;s also (78:46 - 78:51)
more opportunities to do it so if I&#39;m (78:49 - 78:54)
busy next weekend I can&#39;t do those (78:51 - 78:56)
gigant to Max ones and we don&#39;t I mean (78:54 - 78:57)
obviously they&#39;ll come back everything (78:56 - 79:01)
comes back in Pokemon um but I won&#39;t get (78:57 - 79:04)
it until the next time but also as you (79:01 - 79:06)
say having the shorter period of time (79:04 - 79:08)
does mean that it&#39;s easier to get a (79:06 - 79:11)
group together so it it&#39;s a constant (79:08 - 79:14)
difficult thing I I I&#39;m not willing to (79:11 - 79:15)
say there is no solution to it because I (79:14 - 79:17)
think there is a solution to it and that (79:15 - 79:18)
was remote raid passes and I think it (79:17 - 79:21)
worked really well um I understand why (79:18 - 79:23)
they try and get away from that as much (79:21 - 79:26)
as possible now because of the uh (79:23 - 79:28)
wanting to get people physically (79:26 - 79:31)
together but it it just it is a a fact (79:28 - 79:34)
of life that there those two things (79:31 - 79:37)
conf it&#39;s hard to get people (79:34 - 79:39)
together yeah it&#39;s hard enough to get (79:37 - 79:41)
people together for a board game night (79:39 - 79:45)
um getting people together for a raid is (79:41 - 79:48)
maybe even more difficult sometimes I (79:45 - 79:50)
will say the one thing that just keeps (79:48 - 79:52)
bothering me is that I don&#39;t know I (79:50 - 79:55)
don&#39;t necessarily have a problem with (79:52 - 79:57)
the idea that this is kind of starting (79:55 - 79:58)
over with a new collection you have to (79:57 - 80:00)
catch the Pokemon all over again to do (79:58 - 80:02)
these (80:00 - 80:04)
raids it&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s (80:02 - 80:08)
Dynamax and that&#39;s not how Dynamax (80:04 - 80:11)
works yeah that still bothers (80:08 - 80:14)
me that&#39;s going to probably continue to (80:11 - 80:15)
oh that you could just put particles (80:14 - 80:17)
into what you already have and the (80:15 - 80:21)
Dynamax everything yeah yeah yeah (80:17 - 80:24)
that new system if it was if it was a (80:21 - 80:26)
totally new system that wasn&#39;t Dynamax I (80:24 - 80:27)
would probably have less of an issue (80:26 - 80:30)
with it but because it&#39;s Dynamax and we (80:27 - 80:33)
know how Dynamax works there&#39;s still (80:30 - 80:35)
that little still that little annoyance (80:33 - 80:37)
look we know that Niantic are willing to (80:35 - 80:39)
bend the rules of what the lore Behind (80:37 - 80:41)
these things are you know do you do I (80:39 - 80:45)
have to go over zygard again (80:41 - 80:47)
yeah I mean to be fair if we&#39;re if nitic (80:45 - 80:49)
is following rules they are following (80:47 - 80:51)
the rules on gigantamax technically (80:49 - 80:56)
properly gigantamax yeah but not Dynamax (80:51 - 80:57)
except for the (80:56 - 80:59)
soup yeah but the soup came later in the (80:57 - 81:01)
main Series games anyway right yeah yeah (80:59 - 81:03)
yeah exactly if we were just not having (81:01 - 81:05)
the max soup that wouldn&#39;t be an issue (81:03 - 81:07)
but Dynamax Works a different way it (81:05 - 81:08)
doesn&#39;t work like (81:07 - 81:10)
this yeah I mean I&#39;m very excited for (81:08 - 81:13)
when the 299 Max soup appears in the (81:10 - 81:15)
store under the poffin for 300 poke (81:13 - 81:18)
coins and you can give the max soup to (81:15 - 81:20)
multiple Pokemon except for Mel metal (81:18 - 81:23)
because melmetal will be exclusive to (81:20 - 81:28)
Ray J melmetal will be like the 30 to 60 (81:23 - 81:31)
like it is thematically it is cool to (81:28 - 81:32)
think about it is cool to think about (81:31 - 81:34)
like one day there will probably be a (81:32 - 81:37)
Max eternus in raids which we never got (81:34 - 81:40)
in sword and shield and that it will be (81:37 - 81:43)
cool that like at some event at like a a (81:40 - 81:44)
Galler (81:43 - 81:47)
tour uh in Las Vegas that 40 of us will (81:44 - 81:49)
be standing there to get this Pokemon (81:47 - 81:51)
for the cool first time I I do think (81:49 - 81:53)
those are genely genuinely cool (81:51 - 81:54)
experiences and I totally get it not (81:53 - 81:56)
everyone can go every event right like I (81:54 - 81:58)
would love to see Fallout Boy and my (81:56 - 82:00)
krance this past weekend at where we (81:58 - 82:02)
were young like can&#39;t be there couldn&#39;t (82:00 - 82:03)
afford the flight couldn&#39;t afford the (82:02 - 82:06)
hotel couldn&#39;t afford the the the the (82:03 - 82:10)
$450 weekend pass but I&#39;m sure everyone (82:06 - 82:11)
was there they&#39;ll remember for the rest (82:10 - 82:13)
of their (82:11 - 82:16)
life look right okay I just have to I (82:13 - 82:17)
like I understand why you make this (82:16 - 82:18)
argument but every time you make it it (82:17 - 82:21)
annoys me just a little bit and that is (82:18 - 82:25)
because Pokemon as a game as a ser iies (82:21 - 82:27)
has always well okay not always they did (82:25 - 82:29)
remove the tagline for a while but I (82:27 - 82:32)
believe it is back have focused around (82:29 - 82:33)
the idea of catching everything right (82:32 - 82:36)
like that is their thing it&#39;s you know (82:33 - 82:38)
we&#39;re going to talk later about the fact (82:36 - 82:40)
that they&#39;ve got another thing for (82:38 - 82:42)
catching everything again um yeah talk (82:40 - 82:44)
about starting (82:42 - 82:44)
over and so yes I understand that not (82:45 - 82:50)
everybody can go to everything and if (82:49 - 82:52)
they do physical events they can&#39;t do (82:50 - 82:53)
them everywhere but that doesn&#39;t mean (82:52 - 82:56)
that everyone shouldn&#39;t be able to get (82:53 - 82:59)
every Pokemon and it&#39;s just a little bit (82:56 - 83:02)
like that is Pokemon and certainly to me (82:59 - 83:04)
that has always been Pokemon is catching (83:02 - 83:07)
everything and so I still I know I can&#39;t (83:04 - 83:09)
I I go back to it I talked about it (83:07 - 83:12)
earlier done catching everything yeah I (83:09 - 83:14)
think the one exception of that is like (83:12 - 83:17)
trading like when I see you Al I can (83:14 - 83:19)
trade you the Indonesian Pikachu wearing (83:17 - 83:22)
the btic shirt (83:19 - 83:24)
like not everyone can have the Pikachu (83:22 - 83:27)
wearing the btic shirt I have way too (83:24 - 83:31)
many please find me and trade them I I (83:27 - 83:33)
will take anything you can send me a (83:31 - 83:35)
Pidgey just I don&#39;t I want to I want you (83:33 - 83:38)
to have them they&#39;re taking up my (83:35 - 83:40)
storage and I don&#39;t want to give Niantic (83:38 - 83:42)
any more money I don&#39;t I have I have so (83:40 - 83:46)
many Pikachus from Indonesia and I (83:42 - 83:48)
please if you find me in a (83:46 - 83:52)
Target I you can have it but then we get (83:48 - 83:53)
back to the problem of I I don&#39;t have (83:52 - 83:55)
very much Stardust (83:53 - 83:56)
Trad C (83:55 - 83:58)
started although that&#39;s probably not (83:56 - 84:00)
going to be an issue it&#39;s probably yeah (83:58 - 84:01)
that&#39;s that it&#39;s not going to be an (84:00 - 84:02)
issue when trading with Steve because (84:01 - 84:04)
we&#39;re back to best friends again but uh (84:02 - 84:06)
yeah luckily I don&#39;t think Pikachu&#39;s are (84:04 - 84:09)
that expensive so (84:06 - 84:12)
no um all right speaking of starting (84:09 - 84:16)
over if you want a specific special uh (84:12 - 84:19)
shiny mythical Pokemon you kind of have (84:16 - 84:21)
to start over uh but we will get to that (84:19 - 84:24)
after our break so we will be right back (84:21 - 84:27)
and and we are back from our break a new (84:24 - 84:30)
Pokemon home update and a opportunity to (84:27 - 84:33)
earn shiny moweta this s pokemon.com the (84:30 - 84:36)
latest Pokemon home update adds the (84:33 - 84:39)
Pokemon guide book feature and a way to (84:36 - 84:42)
be rewarded for completing the games (84:39 - 84:44)
pokedexes uh Pokemon home is now up to (84:42 - 84:46)
version (84:44 - 84:49)
3.2.2 the guide book if you have not (84:46 - 84:51)
looked at that yet which I think that (84:49 - 84:52)
kind of got overshadowed by the shiny (84:51 - 84:55)
Metta news is players can view basic (84:52 - 84:56)
information about Pokémon such as their (84:55 - 84:59)
Pokédex entries types size forms more (84:56 - 85:01)
this information is even available if (84:59 - 85:03)
that Pokemon has not been registered in (85:01 - 85:05)
your national decks and Pokemon home you (85:03 - 85:07)
can also discover which games Pokemon (85:05 - 85:08)
can be encountered in to help you (85:07 - 85:10)
complete your (85:08 - 85:15)
Pokedex so uh funny because uh I made a (85:10 - 85:17)
shiny what can what is allowed to be (85:15 - 85:20)
shiny or not shiny little guide on (85:17 - 85:23)
Instagram like a week ago and shiny mowa (85:20 - 85:27)
has locked since the debut of black and (85:23 - 85:32)
white uh no longer no long is now (85:27 - 85:36)
available so you can get mowa normally (85:32 - 85:40)
in scarlet and violet that was the you (85:36 - 85:43)
know spin three times in the area nor (85:40 - 85:45)
you can get it normally you can (85:43 - 85:48)
technically yes I wouldn&#39;t call it (85:45 - 85:52)
normal exactly yes if something takes a (85:48 - 85:54)
month for anybody in the world to figure (85:52 - 85:57)
it out it&#39;s it&#39;s non normal just look at (85:54 - 86:00)
the code right well even looking at the (85:57 - 86:01)
code they still couldn&#39;t figure out how (86:00 - 86:03)
it work was well this is the whole thing (86:01 - 86:06)
where Victini was like technically in (86:03 - 86:08)
the code for scarlet and violet and (86:06 - 86:10)
people were like I must be here in the (86:08 - 86:12)
game but in reality Victini just ended (86:10 - 86:16)
up being the giveaway at London worlds (86:12 - 86:18)
and it wasn&#39;t actually like an event or (86:16 - 86:21)
anything but you can get a non shiny (86:18 - 86:25)
mellow weda if you purchase the DLC (86:21 - 86:28)
of scarlet and violet (86:25 - 86:33)
which is not particularly new to this (86:28 - 86:37)
like franchise of like purchase the (86:33 - 86:39)
extra content that isn&#39;t the base (86:37 - 86:41)
whether that&#39;s like a third version or (86:39 - 86:42)
now what they&#39;re doing DLC to get like (86:41 - 86:44)
more stuff (86:42 - 86:46)
right (86:44 - 86:49)
um I will remind people because people (86:46 - 86:51)
still do not know this if you bought the (86:49 - 86:55)
sword and shield DLC there is a CIO you (86:51 - 86:58)
can get he is there you can get him uh (86:55 - 87:01)
he&#39;s part of the crown Tundra all you (86:58 - 87:05)
need to do is Catch verian coelan and (87:01 - 87:08)
Teran and then go to little cooking pot (87:05 - 87:13)
with on the island by the big tree in (87:08 - 87:15)
the crown Tundra and then he&#39;ll appear (87:13 - 87:17)
he&#39;s you can&#39;t shiny hunt him but you (87:15 - 87:20)
can Mark hunt him which is really cool (87:17 - 87:22)
um so CIO is (87:20 - 87:27)
there uh yeah so shiny Meloetta you can (87:22 - 87:29)
get through the mobile device of Pokemon (87:27 - 87:30)
home don&#39;t go to your switch version of (87:29 - 87:31)
Pokemon home that is the worst version (87:30 - 87:33)
of Pokemon home I don&#39;t even know why it (87:31 - 87:36)
exists at this point it&#39;s (87:33 - 87:38)
just the the because you got to put the (87:36 - 87:41)
Pokemon in home in the first place right (87:38 - 87:44)
why exists yeah it just like the fact (87:41 - 87:47)
that it&#39;s such (87:44 - 87:49)
a bad version of Pokemon home compared (87:47 - 87:50)
to the mobile version you can&#39;t see (87:49 - 87:53)
marks you can&#39;t see ribbons you can&#39;t (87:50 - 87:55)
yeah there is a perfect version of home (87:53 - 87:57)
that could exist that is a combination (87:55 - 88:00)
of the two versions of home correct and (87:57 - 88:03)
maybe one day we&#39;ll get it I don&#39;t know (88:00 - 88:04)
the one thing I found was funny the (88:03 - 88:08)
other uh you can&#39;t you can see the the (88:04 - 88:09)
national decks on the switch version but (88:08 - 88:12)
you can&#39;t see the game Dees on the (88:09 - 88:14)
switch version which is obviously what (88:12 - 88:17)
you need to know to get this Meloetta so (88:14 - 88:20)
if you&#39;re copying Pokémon over and then (88:17 - 88:21)
double checking what else you&#39;ve got to (88:20 - 88:23)
do you have to copy over on the switch (88:21 - 88:24)
and then open up home on your phone (88:23 - 88:26)
because of course you can&#39;t have them (88:24 - 88:27)
both open at the same time because it (88:26 - 88:29)
will log you out if you log into your (88:27 - 88:33)
switch which like also makes sense it (88:29 - 88:35)
also makes sense like the mobile version (88:33 - 88:37)
is the better version since like the (88:35 - 88:39)
switch won&#39;t be the device (88:37 - 88:41)
forever and there will be another (88:39 - 88:43)
version of whatever Nintendo decides to (88:41 - 88:45)
put out I can&#39;t wait to access Pokemon (88:43 - 88:48)
home on my alarmo um that&#39;s really going (88:45 - 88:51)
to be when the tides change in order to (88:48 - 88:53)
receive this Meloetta you need to (88:51 - 88:57)
complete all three pokedexes in home and (88:53 - 89:00)
then confirm the completion on the game (88:57 - 89:02)
tab in the mobile version of home if (89:00 - 89:04)
you&#39;ve already completed these you will (89:02 - 89:07)
still be eligible to receive it uh the (89:04 - 89:10)
mystery gift must be linked must be (89:07 - 89:11)
aware to receive the mystery gift you (89:10 - 89:13)
must have a linked Nintendo account each (89:11 - 89:16)
Mystery Gift can only be received (89:13 - 89:19)
once and then what was the other thing I (89:16 - 89:21)
was going to (89:19 - 89:24)
say uh (89:21 - 89:26)
I don&#39;t (89:24 - 89:28)
remember but they have (89:26 - 89:33)
to have they have to be from gen n (89:28 - 89:36)
specifically so every I don&#39;t know when (89:33 - 89:39)
origin marks started I think X and Y is (89:36 - 89:43)
when they started no black and white no (89:39 - 89:44)
yeah it (89:43 - 89:48)
was X and Y it was X and Y yeah um and (89:44 - 89:50)
then there was the Game Boy Mark for the (89:48 - 89:52)
Virtual Console (89:50 - 89:55)
Pokemon and the gold so (89:52 - 89:56)
the origin Mark like in let&#39;s go Pikachu (89:55 - 89:57)
let&#39;s go Eevee it&#39;s like a little (89:56 - 90:02)
Pikachu head in X and Y is that the (89:57 - 90:04)
Clover or is that sun and moon no X Y is (90:02 - 90:07)
the hexagon CU oh yeah hexagon sun and (90:04 - 90:10)
moon I think is clover yeah uh sword and (90:07 - 90:12)
shield is like a little Pokeball with (90:10 - 90:15)
like a slash through it anyways uh (90:12 - 90:16)
Scarlet Violet has its own origin Mark (90:15 - 90:18)
you need the origin Mark there so it&#39;s (90:16 - 90:19)
funny because we just spent 20 minutes (90:18 - 90:21)
talking about how Pokémon go was like (90:19 - 90:24)
you need to start over and you kind of (90:21 - 90:26)
literally have to do that here like if (90:24 - 90:29)
you have a Bellsprout weep and (90:26 - 90:32)
Bell Victory Bell from let&#39;s go Pikachu (90:29 - 90:34)
let&#39;s go Eevee in your living decks if (90:32 - 90:37)
you have a living decks they&#39;re like (90:34 - 90:40)
nope that&#39;s not good enough you need (90:37 - 90:43)
a victory bell weeping Bell and bell (90:40 - 90:48)
sprout caught in Pala yep (90:43 - 90:49)
um (90:48 - 90:53)
which is a very Pokemon thing yeah and I (90:49 - 90:55)
think the other thing to to in mind that (90:53 - 90:56)
might trip up a lot of people is you (90:55 - 91:00)
have to either have all three of them or (90:56 - 91:03)
copy them over before you evolve because (91:00 - 91:05)
the the game will not tell Pokemon home (91:03 - 91:07)
that you have you have done that uh and (91:05 - 91:10)
you&#39;ll just end up with just a victory (91:07 - 91:12)
bell at the end if you only yeah it is (91:10 - 91:14)
not reading the Pokedex that you have in (91:12 - 91:15)
your games it is reading the Pokemon (91:14 - 91:17)
that you&#39;re transferring over to (91:15 - 91:21)
home this is this is also a really funny (91:17 - 91:24)
timing cuz I before I took like this two (91:21 - 91:26)
we break off twitch and before I was (91:24 - 91:29)
like in 17 other countries I was (91:26 - 91:32)
organizing my Pokemon home so I had like (91:29 - 91:35)
a full living decks but some of my (91:32 - 91:38)
living decks was Shiny Pokemon so I was (91:35 - 91:41)
like ah like I don&#39;t have a non shiny (91:38 - 91:43)
Jinx like I need to move the shiny Jinx (91:41 - 91:45)
out and then I need to go back to let&#39;s (91:43 - 91:47)
go and I just need to catch a regular (91:45 - 91:49)
Jinx because I was I&#39;m at the point (91:47 - 91:52)
where I like I I need to start a shiny (91:49 - 91:56)
living decks which I have like 500 of (91:52 - 91:57)
wait more more than 500 you&#39;re (91:56 - 91:59)
definitely going to be more than 500 (91:57 - 92:01)
like I&#39;m at I&#39;m at 850 you&#39;ll be higher (91:59 - 92:03)
than me yeah I I keep thinking there&#39;s (92:01 - 92:06)
like 700 (92:03 - 92:06)
Pokemon long past that at this point I (92:06 - 92:11)
know yeah I would I would I would guess (92:09 - 92:14)
I would be at like 800 of 1,025 Pokemon (92:11 - 92:16)
Shiny Pokemon so I was like I need I (92:14 - 92:19)
need to I&#39;m I I need to fill in the non (92:16 - 92:21)
Shiny Pokemon and then move the shiny (92:19 - 92:23)
Pokemon into its own area in Pokemon (92:21 - 92:25)
home (92:23 - 92:28)
uh so I was working on that and then of (92:25 - 92:30)
course people were asking me how I (92:28 - 92:32)
organize or what marks I use to like (92:30 - 92:33)
track them properly and stuff so I was (92:32 - 92:36)
like making a whole video about that but (92:33 - 92:41)
in terms in in I I&#39;m not even close to (92:36 - 92:45)
doing the shiny or the the living decks (92:41 - 92:47)
of scarlet and (92:45 - 92:51)
violet because interesting if I had a (92:47 - 92:53)
victory (92:51 - 92:57)
bell it it was a it was uh originally a (92:53 - 93:00)
bell sprout but now it&#39;s a victory bell (92:57 - 93:02)
and so it didn&#39;t count the first two so (93:00 - 93:04)
now I have to like so I have I have like (93:02 - 93:06)
the whole thing completed except for (93:04 - 93:08)
like the pre-evolutions so I have to go (93:06 - 93:09)
back and get like a Bells Sprout or an (93:08 - 93:13)
Atkins or a a small live because all of (93:09 - 93:15)
those Pokemon have been evolved at this (93:13 - 93:17)
point yeah small is a bad example (93:15 - 93:19)
because it&#39;s already gen9 so the the (93:17 - 93:22)
annoying thing about this is I did have (93:19 - 93:24)
a living Dex for I did (93:22 - 93:28)
I did and then my switch broke and this (93:24 - 93:31)
was like a week after home came out for (93:28 - 93:34)
for Gen n so I hadn&#39;t copied it all over (93:31 - 93:36)
so that all disappeared (93:34 - 93:39)
uh I&#39;m now working on it again but yeah (93:36 - 93:42)
I had a living deex too but I started (93:39 - 93:44)
throwing Pokemon away because I was like (93:42 - 93:45)
I (93:44 - 93:47)
don&#39;t like because you didn&#39;t think you (93:45 - 93:49)
needed them right cuz they they were (93:47 - 93:51)
already registered in home right like oh (93:49 - 93:53)
this this fenin is from X and Y I don&#39;t (93:51 - 93:54)
need a (93:53 - 93:56)
I don&#39;t need a sword and shield I don&#39;t (93:54 - 93:57)
need a scarlet and violet fenin I (93:56 - 93:59)
already have fenin registered so I threw (93:57 - 94:02)
it away yeah this I have all the tools (93:59 - 94:04)
worst time for them to be doing this (94:02 - 94:06)
thing right so they they added the the (94:04 - 94:09)
game dexes and the completion of that uh (94:06 - 94:13)
I think just with the support for bdsp (94:09 - 94:19)
and uh um Legends archus right so (94:13 - 94:21)
there&#39;s only been one Pokemon switch (94:19 - 94:23)
game that has come out since they added (94:21 - 94:25)
that Fe (94:23 - 94:27)
uh so like if they&#39;d added that feature (94:25 - 94:28)
right at the beginning I feel like more (94:27 - 94:30)
people would have started doing that (94:28 - 94:32)
then um especially as the first switch (94:30 - 94:34)
game was like only 150 right so it&#39;s (94:32 - 94:38)
much easier to do than 400 which is both (94:34 - 94:40)
you know sarden shield and Scarlet (94:38 - 94:43)
what&#39;s also funny about this timing is I (94:40 - 94:45)
was literally doing this for let&#39;s go (94:43 - 94:47)
cuz if you go into home there will be (94:45 - 94:50)
little crowns so how you know you get (94:47 - 94:52)
the Metta you have the three crowns in (94:50 - 94:53)
scarlet and violet so I have all the (94:52 - 94:56)
crown for sword and shield and I was (94:53 - 94:58)
four Pokemon away from let go and it was (94:56 - 95:01)
literally like Haunter (94:58 - 95:04)
graer uh whatever the middle ones were (95:01 - 95:06)
because when you trade (95:04 - 95:10)
them they&#39;re no longer that so so I was (95:06 - 95:12)
like before I went on all my trips I was (95:10 - 95:14)
like oh I&#39;m going to go back to let go (95:12 - 95:16)
because I&#39;m like missing four Pokemon (95:14 - 95:17)
and I want the little Crown next to my (95:16 - 95:20)
let&#39;s go which I now have so the only (95:17 - 95:23)
games I don&#39;t have crowns next to are (95:20 - 95:26)
Legend (95:23 - 95:28)
which I&#39;m only missing a handful bdsp (95:26 - 95:32)
which is like 80 out of 400 or whatever (95:28 - 95:34)
because and then scarlet and (95:32 - 95:37)
violet uh because of the evolution stuff (95:34 - 95:40)
and because I needed space but like (95:37 - 95:41)
realistically I could probably get (95:40 - 95:44)
mowett in in a day like if I if I woke (95:41 - 95:46)
up at like 10:00 a.m. and I was like (95:44 - 95:47)
okay I need to breed I need to breed (95:46 - 95:49)
Victory Bell I need to go catch a Atkins (95:47 - 95:54)
I need a like I I&#39;m not like I have have (95:49 - 95:56)
all the tools to be like oh the this (95:54 - 95:58)
needs to go in with a ditto okay two (95:56 - 96:00)
eggs hatch okay this needs to go in with (95:58 - 96:01)
a ditto two eggs hatch like I have all (96:00 - 96:04)
the tools to do it uh I&#39;m I think I&#39;m (96:01 - 96:08)
GNA save it for Christmas because I I (96:04 - 96:10)
okay I think getting mowa on like I&#39;ll (96:08 - 96:12)
probably do like everything except like (96:10 - 96:15)
one Pokemon and then on that final on (96:12 - 96:16)
Christmas I&#39;ll move that one Pokemon (96:15 - 96:18)
over I tried to do sure it&#39;s an actual (96:16 - 96:21)
Christmas one and not a boxing day one (96:18 - 96:22)
yes cuz I tried to do this with the (96:21 - 96:25)
original color MC (96:22 - 96:28)
and I did it at like 6:30 central time (96:25 - 96:31)
but that was technically 12:30 (96:28 - 96:32)
a.m. (96:31 - 96:34)
UTC so then my (96:32 - 96:38)
mca&#39;s Boxing Day Boxing Day not actual (96:34 - 96:41)
Christmas I also I have a conspiracy (96:38 - 96:43)
about this a theory about why they&#39;ve (96:41 - 96:45)
done this just (96:43 - 96:48)
now I think we&#39;re in the we&#39;re in the (96:45 - 96:50)
year with no Pokemon game no Pokemon (96:48 - 96:52)
game no Pokemon DLC so this is just (96:50 - 96:54)
getting people back to actually play the (96:52 - 96:56)
games they need to fill the time they (96:54 - 96:58)
need to get people playing the game (96:56 - 97:01)
still they don&#39;t have seemingly a lot to (96:58 - 97:04)
fill in at this point in (97:01 - 97:06)
time and it&#39;s but it&#39;s also it&#39;s the (97:04 - 97:08)
same time of year as the games have (97:06 - 97:10)
typically come out right so it&#39;s keeping (97:08 - 97:12)
you in that habit of it&#39;s October it&#39;s (97:10 - 97:14)
November I play Pokemon that&#39;s that&#39;s (97:12 - 97:16)
what we (97:14 - 97:20)
do I I think this is such a cool way to (97:16 - 97:23)
give you a shiny mythical yes like I did (97:20 - 97:26)
see as obvious because I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m (97:23 - 97:28)
chronically online you know I saw the (97:26 - 97:30)
amount of people that are like this is (97:28 - 97:32)
too much work I&#39;m not interested (97:30 - 97:34)
whatever but I feel like that&#39;s the same (97:32 - 97:36)
energy or maybe even the same people (97:34 - 97:38)
that are like oh I have to go to (97:36 - 97:40)
GameStop to get a shiny Zygarde I know (97:38 - 97:41)
zygarde&#39;s not mythical but like that was (97:40 - 97:42)
a big complaint about zygard and it&#39;s (97:41 - 97:44)
like or complaining that all of the (97:42 - 97:47)
shinies come from go these days yeah (97:44 - 97:50)
like shiny Mew in Pokémon go (97:47 - 97:54)
um which I the people complain that that (97:50 - 97:56)
was too much work too to like get the (97:54 - 97:59)
Mew and it&#39;s like maybe maybe it is a (97:56 - 98:01)
different audience but you have so many (97:59 - 98:04)
vocal people being like I wish Pokemon (98:01 - 98:06)
were harder to get or you had to work (98:04 - 98:07)
for them or they had to be like (98:06 - 98:09)
memorable or or whatnot and then you (98:07 - 98:12)
have other people being like this is too (98:09 - 98:14)
much get this this is too much I&#39;m never (98:12 - 98:16)
gonna get this I I don&#39;t particularly I (98:14 - 98:17)
don&#39;t particularly mind right like I (98:16 - 98:19)
think it&#39;s fine whatever they decide to (98:17 - 98:22)
do and I think I understand when people (98:19 - 98:24)
are like oh that&#39;s a lot of work to do (98:22 - 98:26)
but I will say if you&#39;re not willing to (98:24 - 98:32)
catch what 600 Pokemon to get a Shiny (98:26 - 98:34)
Pokemon that has never been released as (98:32 - 98:36)
a Shiny Pokemon before can you really (98:34 - 98:38)
call yourself a Pokemon master I don&#39;t (98:36 - 98:41)
think you can like ash would be so (98:38 - 98:43)
disappointed this is not this is not a (98:41 - 98:46)
situation with like go or sleep where (98:43 - 98:48)
it&#39;s like a limited time event or it&#39;s (98:46 - 98:50)
like really hard to get specific Pokemon (98:48 - 98:52)
if you have the game you can get (98:50 - 98:54)
everything and like as Steve said is (98:52 - 98:56)
actually if you&#39;ve got a completed game (98:54 - 98:57)
and you&#39;ve been doing like especially if (98:56 - 98:59)
you&#39;ve been doing like the Seven Star (98:57 - 99:01)
rage you probably have a lot of (98:59 - 99:04)
like uh candy for powering them up as (99:01 - 99:05)
well so you don&#39;t even really need to do (99:04 - 99:07)
much effort into evolving them and (99:05 - 99:09)
Scarlet and violet like so I&#39;ve done (99:07 - 99:13)
quite a few um like uh Professor Oak (99:09 - 99:14)
challenges which is where you&#39;re like (99:13 - 99:15)
catching all the Pokemon you can before (99:14 - 99:17)
you do a gym and different games are (99:15 - 99:20)
very different in how they work that way (99:17 - 99:22)
but actually scarlet and violet I found (99:20 - 99:24)
has been one of the best for that s of (99:22 - 99:26)
thing because there are so many Pokemon (99:24 - 99:28)
that you can catch without having to (99:26 - 99:33)
evolve like you can just go and get (99:28 - 99:35)
a h a (99:33 - 99:38)
um a Garchomp for example there&#39;s a (99:35 - 99:40)
Garchomp standing around you can go (99:38 - 99:41)
battle him and catch him you don&#39;t have (99:40 - 99:43)
to catch a Gibble and evolve it like you (99:41 - 99:46)
can do that for almost all the Pokemon (99:43 - 99:48)
you can catch in the wild somewhere (99:46 - 99:51)
which is a really fun different way of (99:48 - 99:52)
doing it compared to previous games (99:51 - 99:55)
right yeah as somebody who was trying to (99:52 - 99:57)
complete my pokedex in Black to White 2 (99:55 - 99:58)
cuz that&#39;s the first Pokemon game with (99:57 - 100:00)
the shiny charm it&#39;s like cool I caught (99:58 - 100:03)
a Gibble now I have to battle like 800 (100:00 - 100:06)
odino to get this to a Garchomp yeah (100:03 - 100:08)
whereas I think Al makes a great point (100:06 - 100:10)
if you&#39;ve been playing and you&#39;ve you (100:08 - 100:12)
even if you&#39;ve just beat these (100:10 - 100:16)
games and you stepped away you have (100:12 - 100:18)
already unlocked almost every single (100:16 - 100:20)
tool in the game whether that&#39;s like (100:18 - 100:23)
flight or money or (100:20 - 100:26)
the just the entire map to be like okay (100:23 - 100:28)
cool I&#39;m missing Garchomp I&#39;m going to (100:26 - 100:29)
fly here I&#39;m going to catch him I&#39;m (100:28 - 100:30)
missing haxus I&#39;m going to fly here I&#39;m (100:29 - 100:33)
going to catch them uh I&#39;m too lazy to (100:30 - 100:35)
look for fracture I&#39;m just going to put (100:33 - 100:38)
haxus and AD ditto together two eggs (100:35 - 100:41)
here&#39;s a bunch of rare candy done (100:38 - 100:45)
like I will say though to that point the (100:41 - 100:47)
breeding in this game is the worst for I (100:45 - 100:49)
just want one of a Pokemon right okay (100:47 - 100:51)
all right that&#39;s fair that&#39;s fair it&#39;s (100:49 - 100:53)
very easy to get Pokemon the other ways (100:51 - 100:54)
but if you&#39;re trying get Pokemon by (100:53 - 100:56)
getting eggs that&#39;s not not as quick as (100:54 - 100:58)
you got you got to be really efficient (100:56 - 100:59)
with it right get all the Pokemon you (100:58 - 101:02)
want to breed make your sandwich and (100:59 - 101:04)
just you got to just spend that half an (101:02 - 101:06)
hour doing as many as you possibly can (101:04 - 101:08)
oh I don&#39;t even make a sandwich anymore (101:06 - 101:10)
in these games I I go to like the little (101:08 - 101:12)
like ice cream shop that sells like egg (101:10 - 101:14)
level two and I just buy that it&#39;s it&#39;s (101:12 - 101:16)
like a ham sandwich you don&#39;t even need (101:14 - 101:19)
to do anything throw some ham on it and (101:16 - 101:21)
then watch the table like Shake (101:19 - 101:23)
violently as like you&#39;re trying to like (101:21 - 101:26)
place the it yeah I&#39;m falls through to (101:23 - 101:29)
the floor I I I I think this is this is (101:26 - 101:30)
really cool there&#39;s no time that&#39;s what (101:29 - 101:31)
I was going to say earlier there&#39;s no (101:30 - 101:33)
time limit on this just like there&#39;s no (101:31 - 101:35)
time limit on a geara I have heard some (101:33 - 101:37)
people say I cannot confirm this because (101:35 - 101:40)
I haven&#39;t done it that you do not need (101:37 - 101:46)
petun uh or the the um dinosaur Paradox (101:40 - 101:49)
Pokemon how like kind of legendary kind (101:46 - 101:52)
of paradox it&#39;s specifically the two (101:49 - 101:54)
that are not (101:52 - 101:55)
through (101:54 - 101:58)
events the walking wake and what&#39;s Theon (101:55 - 102:00)
leaves I think it&#39;s walking wake iron (101:58 - 102:02)
leaves gorging fire I don&#39;t think you (102:00 - 102:04)
need those I think you do need gorging (102:02 - 102:07)
fire because you can catch that in not (102:04 - 102:10)
oh yeah I say gorging he Gorge it&#39;s only (102:07 - 102:13)
the ones that you can&#39;t if you buy a (102:10 - 102:15)
game just now and you play through it so (102:13 - 102:17)
walking away iron leaves yeah it&#39;s just (102:15 - 102:19)
it&#39;s just those two and pit everything (102:17 - 102:22)
else you have to (102:19 - 102:24)
get yeah there&#39;s also like the (102:22 - 102:26)
conversation of like this being pay to (102:24 - 102:27)
win (102:26 - 102:30)
which I think people are maybe not (102:27 - 102:32)
realizing what pay to win actually means (102:30 - 102:35)
because I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re what (102:32 - 102:37)
are youn not sure I&#39;m not sure what (102:35 - 102:39)
you&#39;re winning yeah unless like putting (102:37 - 102:41)
shiny Metta on your LinkedIn profiles (102:39 - 102:42)
winning at life (102:41 - 102:45)
possibly (102:42 - 102:50)
um these games are not free so (102:45 - 102:54)
like Scarlet Violet is a $60 gift (102:50 - 102:56)
unless you&#39;re filling up your Pokemon (102:54 - 103:00)
home solely from Pokemon go um so win is (102:56 - 103:01)
kind of (103:00 - 103:06)
any yeah so I I I I it&#39;s really weird (103:01 - 103:09)
when people apply pay to win to $60 (103:06 - 103:13)
games um because like mowa is free I (103:09 - 103:15)
mean there there are arguments where yes (103:13 - 103:17)
there for sure are $60 games that are (103:15 - 103:20)
pay to win but here what are you winning (103:17 - 103:21)
it&#39;s yeah I think I think people don&#39;t (103:20 - 103:22)
understand the difference between pay to (103:21 - 103:25)
win and pay to access which is just (103:22 - 103:29)
called buying a game uh because like you (103:25 - 103:30)
have to you have to buy the game and you (103:29 - 103:32)
have to buy the DLC but that&#39;s have to (103:30 - 103:34)
buy the DLC though to be fair you don&#39;t (103:32 - 103:36)
have to buy the DLC oh I guess you could (103:34 - 103:38)
trade with people yeah you could trade (103:36 - 103:40)
and also you can access all you can (103:38 - 103:42)
still access those (103:40 - 103:46)
raids MH like if if you did an um Sina (103:42 - 103:49)
raid Al and I don&#39;t have the DLC I can (103:46 - 103:52)
join your raid and get the Sina yeah (103:49 - 103:54)
yeah yeah so like (103:52 - 103:56)
you you can trade and also like um (103:54 - 103:58)
Victory Bell is I keep using Victory (103:56 - 103:59)
Bell because it&#39;s a really good example (103:58 - 104:02)
Victory Bell is in the DLC not in the (103:59 - 104:05)
base game so I can get a victory bell (104:02 - 104:07)
from let&#39;s go Pikachu let&#39;s go Eevee (104:05 - 104:10)
breed it and now I&#39;ve got that line done (104:07 - 104:12)
without purchasing the DLC so like I (104:10 - 104:14)
don&#39;t even agree with the people that (104:12 - 104:16)
are like I have to buy the DLC to get (104:14 - 104:19)
this you don&#39;t uh is it going to be (104:16 - 104:21)
harder and more annoying yeah sure of (104:19 - 104:23)
course like the the base game got (104:21 - 104:25)
significantly better when you were able (104:23 - 104:27)
to fly everywhere right like yes do you (104:25 - 104:30)
need to fly everywhere no but it it (104:27 - 104:32)
makes helps a whole lot it does help a (104:30 - 104:36)
whole lot um so but yeah I mean like (104:32 - 104:39)
again this (104:36 - 104:43)
is I I do really dislike when people (104:39 - 104:44)
because there there is this distaste for (104:43 - 104:46)
scarlet and violet and I think some of (104:44 - 104:47)
it is warranted right like the frame (104:46 - 104:49)
rate being bad like the graphics being (104:47 - 104:51)
not great like I I think some of the (104:49 - 104:54)
distaste is is very warrant for scarland (104:51 - 104:56)
Violet and I&#39;ve always pointed that that (104:54 - 104:58)
stuff out but I think there is like this (104:56 - 105:00)
revisionist history that like Pokemon (104:58 - 105:01)
this was the first game Pokemon has ever (105:00 - 105:03)
done this or like look at these (105:01 - 105:05)
behaviors Pokemon is doing now and it&#39;s (105:03 - 105:07)
like this has existed forever and that&#39;s (105:05 - 105:09)
not to defend it&#39;s just pointing out (105:07 - 105:12)
that these are not new behaviors if you (105:09 - 105:16)
bought uh if you bought Ruby and (105:12 - 105:19)
Sapphire which had what almost 300 (105:16 - 105:21)
Pokemon I think 300 and some Pokemon (105:19 - 105:23)
that game had breeding in it you know (105:21 - 105:26)
what that game didn&#39;t have ditto ditto (105:23 - 105:29)
was not in that game at all if you (105:26 - 105:32)
wanted a Ditto in that game which could (105:29 - 105:33)
be moved into that game you would have (105:32 - 105:36)
to find somebody who had fire red and (105:33 - 105:39)
leaf green two $40 games and one of (105:36 - 105:41)
y&#39;all had to have a $15 Link cable or (105:39 - 105:44)
the $20 Wireless Link cable or somebody (105:41 - 105:47)
had to buy a $60 version I think of (105:44 - 105:48)
Coliseum it was either Coliseum or Gale (105:47 - 105:50)
of darkness ditto&#39;s in one of those and (105:48 - 105:53)
then again have another Link cable and (105:50 - 105:55)
get those games so I&#39;m not saying that (105:53 - 105:57)
like I&#39;m not saying that to defend what (105:55 - 105:59)
they&#39;ve been doing I&#39;m just pointing out (105:57 - 106:01)
that scarlet and violet is not the first (105:59 - 106:03)
game to do this they have been doing (106:01 - 106:06)
this for years decades they have been (106:03 - 106:08)
doing this for decades I&#39;d also argue (106:06 - 106:10)
it&#39;s getting better right because back (106:08 - 106:13)
then you had to find somebody to do it (106:10 - 106:17)
right whereas now you can get on trading (106:13 - 106:19)
you can go on Reddit you can just add (106:17 - 106:22)
something to the the GTS you know it&#39;s (106:19 - 106:24)
so much especially like let me tell you (106:22 - 106:27)
something see if you have a 100 Shiny (106:24 - 106:30)
Bulbasaur from the three Community Days (106:27 - 106:31)
we&#39;ve had for (106:30 - 106:33)
Bulbasaur stick one of them into home (106:31 - 106:36)
stick it on the GTS you will get (106:33 - 106:38)
anything you ask for people will trade (106:36 - 106:41)
anything for a shiny I promise you right (106:38 - 106:44)
I have like five in Amorous I have not (106:41 - 106:47)
played Legends AR archus 3 five times I (106:44 - 106:50)
have just put a random Community shiny (106:47 - 106:52)
on the GTS and gotten an Amorous back it (106:50 - 106:54)
is so (106:52 - 106:57)
easy yeah for the record you don&#39;t need (106:54 - 106:58)
an Amorous for (106:57 - 107:00)
this oh yeah yeah just using that as an (106:58 - 107:02)
example right because that&#39;s one of the (107:00 - 107:06)
hardest Pokemon still to get um I think (107:02 - 107:08)
this is really cool (107:06 - 107:10)
I you know you don&#39;t have to rush out (107:08 - 107:12)
and do it now if you have like time over (107:10 - 107:15)
Thanksgiving or whatever good time to do (107:12 - 107:17)
it maybe a good time to organize your (107:15 - 107:18)
boxes maybe you should maybe organize (107:17 - 107:21)
your boxes before you start this because (107:18 - 107:24)
this could be a mess uh maybe you can do (107:21 - 107:26)
both at the same time I just think in (107:24 - 107:28)
general this is a cool way to get a (107:26 - 107:30)
mythical that (107:28 - 107:34)
isn&#39;t um play Pokemon go which I think (107:30 - 107:37)
is a valid complaint like it&#39;s cool that (107:34 - 107:38)
as a Pokemon go player I could get shiny (107:37 - 107:42)
me for the first time but I totally (107:38 - 107:45)
understand not everyone plays that game (107:42 - 107:47)
um and I think Mew is technically like (107:45 - 107:50)
the easiest mythical to probably get out (107:47 - 107:52)
of the the ones they&#39;ve introduced since (107:50 - 107:55)
then (107:52 - 107:55)
uh uh but yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s happening (107:59 - 108:03)
right (108:02 - 108:06)
now and and when I say right now I mean (108:03 - 108:08)
it&#39;s it&#39;s not going anywhere so it is it (108:06 - 108:11)
is live and you can get it and uh this (108:08 - 108:13)
event will be over but as long as you (108:11 - 108:15)
don&#39;t connect to the internet it will (108:13 - 108:17)
stay they did version exclusive Pokemon (108:15 - 108:19)
so they put Stone Jer iceq armor sured (108:17 - 108:22)
in raids just what Al was saying earlier (108:19 - 108:25)
like you don&#39;t need to catch a Char (108:22 - 108:27)
Cadet and then evolve it you could (108:25 - 108:29)
Scarlet Violet has been really good at (108:27 - 108:31)
just letting you get Evolutions I don&#39;t (108:29 - 108:34)
think I&#39;ve ever done that Evolution ever (108:31 - 108:36)
I don&#39;t even know what to do for charet (108:34 - 108:39)
it&#39;s like you give it a shield (108:36 - 108:42)
and I&#39;ve only ever caught the evolutions (108:39 - 108:45)
in raids I&#39;ve never just it&#39;s just an (108:42 - 108:46)
item Evolution it&#39;s like a it&#39;s like a (108:45 - 108:48)
stone it&#39;s one of them is like (108:46 - 108:50)
auspicious armor is one of them and I (108:48 - 108:52)
cannot remember the name of the other (108:50 - 108:55)
one but the it&#39;s that that item is (108:52 - 108:57)
exclusive to the games so you have you (108:55 - 108:59)
go to some random person in one of the (108:57 - 109:01)
towns and you give them something I (108:59 - 109:03)
can&#39;t even remember what it is you give (109:01 - 109:06)
them I did it once yeah I&#39;ve never done (109:03 - 109:08)
I like I know that person exists I&#39;ve (109:06 - 109:10)
never talked to them yeah you have to (109:08 - 109:12)
give them an item that actually isn&#39;t (109:10 - 109:14)
easy to come by in the beginning of the (109:12 - 109:16)
game so I remember farming that item but (109:14 - 109:18)
I don&#39;t remember what it is I feel like (109:16 - 109:20)
it&#39;s a Pokemon material I think I think (109:18 - 109:23)
you&#39;re right yes (109:20 - 109:25)
it was I&#39;ve only I&#39;ve caught Char Cadet (109:23 - 109:27)
and then I did a raid for armor Rouge I (109:25 - 109:29)
did a raid for cill Edge I never never (109:27 - 109:31)
thought about it again you just made me (109:29 - 109:34)
realize because they announced the (109:31 - 109:38)
uh um the outbreaks as well which are (109:34 - 109:41)
the verion exclusive thing Pokemon but (109:38 - 109:43)
they announced that before the Pokemon (109:41 - 109:45)
home Stu there&#39;s no way that&#39;s a (109:43 - 109:46)
coincidence right they&#39;ve done that to (109:45 - 109:49)
make it easier to collect complete 100% (109:46 - 109:50)
yeah that&#39;s why I was bringing this up (109:49 - 109:51)
even though this event was over they did (109:50 - 109:55)
the I got exclusive raids and then the (109:51 - 109:59)
or oranguru Pimon in Pala kakami was (109:55 - 110:01)
crar morco and then blueberry was (109:59 - 110:04)
sandrew and Vulpix the alolan versions (110:01 - 110:06)
um they did not do a shiny boost or a (110:04 - 110:09)
mark boost which was weird at first (110:06 - 110:11)
because when they announced it they were (110:09 - 110:13)
like they usually say like Mark boost or (110:11 - 110:15)
shiny boosted and then the meloetta news (110:13 - 110:18)
dropped and now it kind of made sense (110:15 - 110:19)
they were probably like we don&#39;t want (110:18 - 110:22)
you to focus on shiny and Mark we just (110:19 - 110:24)
want you to catch the for your Pokedex (110:22 - 110:26)
so you can then get this (110:24 - 110:28)
Meloetta (110:26 - 110:31)
um would it have been nice yes 100% I (110:28 - 110:34)
really like I think Mark boost is to me (110:31 - 110:37)
Mark boost is more exciting than shiny (110:34 - 110:41)
boost uh because shiny&#39;s or I don&#39;t want (110:37 - 110:43)
to say easier to get but like if you&#39;ve (110:41 - 110:45)
been doing Seven Star raids you&#39;ve (110:43 - 110:46)
probably been swimming in urbom mystica (110:45 - 110:49)
at this point so yeah they&#39;re also quite (110:46 - 110:51)
often like one and done whereas with (110:49 - 110:53)
Mark boost you can try and get different (110:51 - 110:55)
ones and try and get a shiny with a mark (110:53 - 110:57)
and stuff like that yeah yeah yeah yeah (110:55 - 111:01)
so um kind of makes sense I think why (110:57 - 111:02)
they didn&#39;t do the mark boost it was (111:01 - 111:05)
mostly like hey complete your Pokedex I (111:02 - 111:07)
would not now that we&#39;re getting like (111:05 - 111:09)
closer to (111:07 - 111:12)
Christmas I am betting walking wake and (111:09 - 111:15)
iron leaves is going to come back like (111:12 - 111:16)
like not before Christmas but probably (111:15 - 111:19)
like maybe the week or so after like (111:16 - 111:21)
it&#39;s been kind of long enough where they (111:19 - 111:24)
need to like cycle that again (111:21 - 111:27)
yeah yeah maybe a little ways into the (111:24 - 111:29)
new year I wonder if they might actually (111:27 - 111:34)
focus on the other uh the the other DLC (111:29 - 111:38)
um Paradox not Legends maybe Legends (111:34 - 111:39)
because of I think that&#39;s because they (111:38 - 111:41)
count to the (111:39 - 111:45)
meoa yeah I don&#39;t know if they do that (111:41 - 111:47)
like I think eventually they do that in (111:45 - 111:49)
general right the other Paradox I think (111:47 - 111:50)
that would be a really exciting rid (111:49 - 111:52)
event we talked about this last week how (111:50 - 111:55)
like Di and Pia were like so popular (111:52 - 111:56)
even though (111:55 - 111:59)
they&#39;re but like I I do think they have (111:56 - 112:02)
to wait till after Christmas for that (111:59 - 112:03)
yeah because I can&#39;t if they did if they (112:02 - 112:04)
did gouging (112:03 - 112:08)
fire uh or raging bolt like two weeks (112:04 - 112:09)
before (112:08 - 112:11)
Christmas and you just get the game for (112:09 - 112:13)
Christmas like that kind of sucks that (112:11 - 112:15)
would be miserable yeah I guess so I I (112:13 - 112:17)
guess part of the problem right is like (112:15 - 112:21)
I we we&#39;re not normal people right like (112:17 - 112:24)
we buy the game straight away and (112:21 - 112:26)
like I mean Steve I presume you don&#39;t (112:24 - 112:29)
even have your second game like do you (112:26 - 112:31)
do you have your second game finished or (112:29 - 112:32)
you just yeah yeah yeah you have it (112:31 - 112:35)
finished right okay yeah um because yeah (112:32 - 112:38)
I think we&#39;re we&#39;re C presuming Hannah (112:35 - 112:40)
doesn&#39;t I didn&#39;t finish the DLC in my (112:38 - 112:42)
second game but I finished the main (112:40 - 112:45)
story line fair enough oh yeah IC in my (112:42 - 112:47)
second game yeah the games are are P (112:45 - 112:50)
I&#39;ve done them what am I up to five (112:47 - 112:53)
times now uh they&#39;re they&#39;re p for once (112:50 - 112:55)
you get to that many but yeah I I (112:53 - 112:56)
realize that I&#39;m not the normal sort of (112:55 - 112:58)
person right like most people don&#39;t have (112:56 - 113:00)
both games most people don&#39;t have both (112:58 - 113:03)
games completed uh so the the exclusives (113:00 - 113:05)
are quite often harder for people to get (113:03 - 113:08)
than uh some of (113:05 - 113:10)
us (113:08 - 113:12)
yeah (113:10 - 113:14)
um as somebody who&#39;s played through (113:12 - 113:17)
Scarlet Violet multiple times I never (113:14 - 113:18)
want to do it again not that I think (113:17 - 113:22)
they&#39;re like bad games but they&#39;re just (113:18 - 113:25)
big I yeah what I would say though is if (113:22 - 113:28)
you have both games or you want to have (113:25 - 113:29)
both games by the end and you only have (113:28 - 113:31)
one of them (113:29 - 113:35)
complete legitimately doing a Professor (113:31 - 113:37)
Oak Run on one of them is actually (113:35 - 113:40)
really fun because you end up compared (113:37 - 113:42)
to like other games where if you do it (113:40 - 113:43)
and you&#39;re like oh I&#39;ve got like 20 (113:42 - 113:45)
Pokemon to get before the first gym and (113:43 - 113:47)
then I&#39;ve got like another 30 or (113:45 - 113:49)
whatever uh bdsb are terrible because (113:47 - 113:50)
you end up with (113:49 - 113:53)
like getting up to level 40 before the (113:50 - 113:57)
first gym it was not fun um it&#39;s (113:53 - 114:00)
actually you you have you catch like 350 (113:57 - 114:02)
Pokemon before you do the first (114:00 - 114:05)
gym and then it&#39;s just such a weird way (114:02 - 114:08)
of playing the game it&#39;s so different um (114:05 - 114:10)
that it feels quite fun so if you don&#39;t (114:08 - 114:11)
have all the Pokemon and you&#39;re going to (114:10 - 114:13)
catch them all anyway doing it in a way (114:11 - 114:15)
that also means you then have the second (114:13 - 114:18)
game completed um is quite a handy fun (114:15 - 114:22)
thing to do (114:18 - 114:22)
I don&#39;t think you could pay me to play (114:23 - 114:26)
through those games again yeah but this (114:24 - 114:28)
is what I&#39;m saying I&#39;m talking about (114:26 - 114:29)
people who&#39;ve only done it once right (114:28 - 114:32)
like I&#39;m not talking about you I&#39;m not (114:29 - 114:34)
doing it again I have done it enough (114:32 - 114:36)
times there there&#39;s there&#39;s definitely a (114:34 - 114:39)
honeymoon period with like any game like (114:36 - 114:41)
when I when I first played through (114:39 - 114:43)
scarlet and violet besides like the (114:41 - 114:46)
issues like it just felt like Not only (114:43 - 114:48)
was there a lot to do but you were just (114:46 - 114:50)
seeing new stuff over and over and you (114:48 - 114:51)
were going through it and you&#39;re like oh (114:50 - 114:54)
my gosh there&#39;s five team Star members (114:51 - 114:58)
and there&#39;s five uh Titans and then (114:54 - 115:00)
there&#39;s the eight gems and then there&#39;s (114:58 - 115:01)
the Elite Four and then there&#39;s the (115:00 - 115:04)
stuff afterwards and when you go through (115:01 - 115:08)
it the second time you just kind of (115:04 - 115:09)
realize (115:08 - 115:13)
like there&#39;s a lot in between (115:09 - 115:16)
this and it&#39;s not like bad but like that (115:13 - 115:19)
honeymoon period is off at that point (115:16 - 115:21)
and you&#39;re just like I know where the (115:19 - 115:25)
ending is and I&#39;m not close to (115:21 - 115:25)
it that&#39;s fair my second run through was (115:26 - 115:31)
very focused on the story which these (115:29 - 115:33)
games do have a very intriguing (115:31 - 115:36)
potential storyline they just (115:33 - 115:41)
never completed it they dropped it so (115:36 - 115:43)
it&#39;s it&#39;s fine hey that dog survived (115:41 - 115:45)
Hannah that dog is alive we saved it (115:43 - 115:49)
with sandwiches what more do you (115:45 - 115:51)
want I want to know more about the (115:49 - 115:54)
turtle dog is (115:51 - 115:56)
alive (115:54 - 116:00)
uh turtle is also alive I&#39;m (115:56 - 116:00)
sure all right last bit of news uh there (116:01 - 116:06)
is the (116:04 - 116:08)
Latin American International (116:06 - 116:11)
Championship live stream that is going (116:08 - 116:12)
to (116:11 - 116:15)
happen uh where are the dates for (116:12 - 116:19)
that uh I will get the dates in a second (116:15 - 116:20)
but the reason I&#39;m bringing this up is (116:19 - 116:23)
because Connor&#39;s peler Pat Connor&#39;s (116:20 - 116:25)
peler uh will debut during that live (116:23 - 116:27)
stream Patrick won the Masters division (116:25 - 116:29)
for the North America international (116:27 - 116:32)
championship and Patrick used a shiny (116:29 - 116:34)
peler which means we will all get a (116:32 - 116:37)
shiny peler uh that will happen so I&#39;ll (116:34 - 116:40)
post that code on like Instagram and and (116:37 - 116:43)
blue sky and threads and whatever is (116:40 - 116:45)
better than Twitter at this point um (116:43 - 116:47)
it&#39;s not a (116:45 - 116:49)
gastrodon it&#39;s not a gastron and it is (116:47 - 116:54)
shiny so when (116:49 - 116:57)
uh that tournament is it&#39;s the same (116:54 - 116:59)
weekend as the wild area so uh November (116:57 - 117:03)
15th 16th and 17th is when that (116:59 - 117:05)
tournament is happening so the code (117:03 - 117:08)
should debut around the 15th Friday the (117:05 - 117:10)
15th uh they&#39;re saying that the code (117:08 - 117:13)
will expire on November 21st so you do (117:10 - 117:15)
have a couple days after the event to (117:13 - 117:18)
redeem it um for TCG live they&#39;re doing (117:15 - 117:21)
Pikachu EX so you&#39;ll be able to get that (117:18 - 117:24)
card um which is from surging Sparks the (117:21 - 117:26)
new expansion they&#39;re saying that will (117:24 - 117:29)
be able to be redeemed until November (117:26 - 117:33)
25th uh and then there will be TCG TCG (117:29 - 117:36)
drops until December (117:33 - 117:40)
14th I am assuming that there&#39;s probably (117:36 - 117:43)
going to be anyone who streams the TCG (117:40 - 117:45)
live will have those drops on because (117:43 - 117:48)
that&#39;s usually how twitch Works um I (117:45 - 117:49)
don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to be like (117:48 - 117:52)
special streamers privileges of like go (117:49 - 117:54)
here to get your scuba Pikachu and (117:52 - 117:56)
Pokémon go like they did for worlds (117:54 - 118:00)
maybe I don&#39;t know um they are also (117:56 - 118:03)
saying uh out of pocket who was a go (118:00 - 118:07)
player won the go North America (118:03 - 118:08)
international championships with (118:07 - 118:11)
feraligator so you&#39;ll be able to get (118:08 - 118:14)
your own for alligator in Pokemon go (118:11 - 118:16)
which is I think brand new this is the (118:14 - 118:18)
first time they&#39;re giving away yeah (118:16 - 118:21)
that&#39;s new uh Pokemon specific in (118:18 - 118:23)
Pokemon go which I think Hannah and I (118:21 - 118:25)
have talked about for like the last like (118:23 - 118:27)
year plus on this podcast of like why (118:25 - 118:28)
don&#39;t they do this for go they don&#39;t (118:27 - 118:30)
usually do Pokemon distributions like (118:28 - 118:34)
that and go yeah well now they&#39;re I I (118:30 - 118:36)
want I want to correct you I&#39;m pretty (118:34 - 118:38)
sure they&#39;ve done one before they did an (118:36 - 118:39)
alaria (118:38 - 118:42)
alaria uh at some point in the same way (118:39 - 118:44)
because I I was just it&#39;s just timed (118:42 - 118:45)
research it&#39;s not like a mystery gift or (118:44 - 118:47)
something like that but they&#39;ve (118:45 - 118:50)
definitely done an Al Al I can&#39;t see (118:47 - 118:53)
that alaria the swbl (118:50 - 118:55)
um I can&#39;t remember when they but I have (118:53 - 118:57)
a very distinct memory of that happening (118:55 - 119:01)
uh and it was earlier this year I think (118:57 - 119:03)
you might be right about this but it was (119:01 - 119:06)
at the end of like a research so what (119:03 - 119:08)
they&#39;re saying is enable your (119:06 - 119:11)
Twitch yes enable twitch drops on your (119:08 - 119:13)
Twitch watch stream to receive unique (119:11 - 119:15)
time to research and go so you&#39;re just (119:13 - 119:16)
not getting the (119:15 - 119:20)
feraligator um you will get your own (119:16 - 119:22)
unique for alligator to get the most of (119:20 - 119:24)
this Pokemon used in oh they&#39;re not even (119:22 - 119:26)
giving it hydr Cannon to get the most (119:24 - 119:28)
out of this Pokemon use okay never mind (119:26 - 119:31)
this is bad this is bad take back (119:28 - 119:33)
everything I said about Dynamax (119:31 - 119:36)
earlier just give us the feraligator he (119:33 - 119:39)
used they can&#39;t that&#39;s not how Pokémon (119:36 - 119:41)
go works well they can&#39;t they&#39;ve not (119:39 - 119:42)
implemented that feature they could (119:41 - 119:44)
Implement that feature if they wanted to (119:42 - 119:45)
but (119:44 - 119:48)
yes I that Lugia from the Chicago go (119:45 - 119:51)
Fest that they forced into our account (119:48 - 119:53)
yeah I I double check it was North (119:51 - 119:55)
America uh International earlier this (119:53 - 119:59)
year that um we got the area (119:55 - 120:02)
carry this but yeah to get the most out (119:59 - 120:04)
of this Pokemon use an elite charge TM (120:02 - 120:05)
to teach a signature charge attack (120:04 - 120:07)
hydroc Cannon it will be worth it to (120:05 - 120:08)
demolish your Pokemon yes you&#39;re right (120:07 - 120:10)
Al they they did do this with alaria (120:08 - 120:12)
because I remember getting the alar (120:10 - 120:15)
alaria and it being just bad yeah but (120:12 - 120:17)
also I didn&#39;t think of the player who (120:15 - 120:20)
won with it I just thought like oh an (120:17 - 120:23)
Altaria encounter oh it&#39;s bad (120:20 - 120:26)
like they could do this they could be (120:23 - 120:27)
like here (120:26 - 120:29)
are I don&#39;t even know what this for (120:27 - 120:33)
alligator was like two h two attack 15 (120:29 - 120:35)
defense 15 (120:33 - 120:39)
HP with the exact moves he (120:35 - 120:44)
used at 1498 CP or whatever the CP (120:39 - 120:46)
was they wouldn&#39;t even necessar they (120:44 - 120:48)
couldn&#39;t do you the exact IVs obviously (120:46 - 120:50)
with the current game but they (120:48 - 120:53)
could presumably (120:50 - 120:55)
have an event where the Pokemon that you (120:53 - 120:56)
get from that research has the same (120:55 - 121:00)
moves and they could they have boosted (120:56 - 121:02)
IVs in some things so they could boost (121:00 - 121:04)
the IVs and you wouldn&#39;t get the exact (121:02 - 121:07)
IVs but you&#39;d get good IVs at least they (121:04 - 121:10)
could absolutely (121:07 - 121:12)
do there&#39;s some developer at antic going (121:10 - 121:15)
no we can&#39;t for this very specific (121:12 - 121:20)
technical reason I understand I&#39;m (121:15 - 121:20)
sorry I think it&#39;s a good start to be (121:20 - 121:24)
like this is what won here&#39;s the (121:23 - 121:27)
research to get it but like you could (121:24 - 121:28)
easily do this research and be like my (121:27 - 121:31)
for alligator is not good it&#39;s not the (121:28 - 121:32)
it&#39;s and a lot of people aren&#39;t going to (121:31 - 121:34)
even get the research because it&#39;s a (121:32 - 121:36)
twitch drop (121:34 - 121:38)
yeah are you saying that because twitch (121:36 - 121:39)
drops never (121:38 - 121:42)
work the Pokemon ones are kind of (121:39 - 121:44)
particularly bad having gotten twitch (121:42 - 121:46)
drops in multiple games at this point (121:44 - 121:50)
the Pokemon ones are kind of buggy I (121:46 - 121:52)
it&#39;s also compated to do mhm for the (121:50 - 121:54)
Pokemon ones cuz you have to have like (121:52 - 121:56)
uh your account connected to it and then (121:54 - 121:57)
you have to make sure you&#39;re on the (121:56 - 122:01)
right one and then yeah a yes I I did (121:57 - 122:02)
after (122:01 - 122:06)
the disaster that was (122:02 - 122:09)
Hawaii well like I I went to like when (122:06 - 122:11)
when it wasn&#39;t working I like told (122:09 - 122:13)
Pokemon I messaged Mr Pikachu and I was (122:11 - 122:15)
like drops aren&#39;t working and they&#39;re (122:13 - 122:18)
like we know we&#39;re trying to fix it and (122:15 - 122:20)
but that was like several hours of my (122:18 - 122:22)
stream I&#39;m like walking around Hawaii (122:20 - 122:25)
with a with a backpack on it&#39;s like 95 (122:22 - 122:27)
degrees out I&#39;m like trying to play go (122:25 - 122:28)
I&#39;m trying to like show people and it&#39;s (122:27 - 122:31)
just I got 4,000 people being like it&#39;s (122:28 - 122:34)
not working and what I told Mr Pikachu (122:31 - 122:35)
was (122:34 - 122:37)
like you you have multiple issues here (122:35 - 122:40)
right you have you have the issue of (122:37 - 122:43)
like I don&#39;t know what&#39;s not working is (122:40 - 122:46)
it the trainer Club account is it twitch (122:43 - 122:49)
because like let&#39;s be real here twitch (122:46 - 122:51)
historically has never done things right (122:49 - 122:54)
either like there&#39;s a lot of issues that (122:51 - 122:56)
happen on Twitch just in general so is (122:54 - 122:59)
it like is this a twitch problem is this (122:56 - 123:01)
a trainer Club problem or the third (122:59 - 123:04)
entity of Pokemon of Niantic is this a (123:01 - 123:07)
Niantic problem because like also not a (123:04 - 123:09)
great history of getting things right (123:07 - 123:11)
the first time just talk to anybody in (123:09 - 123:15)
New Zealand just you know so you like I (123:11 - 123:18)
don&#39;t know which one it is and so when (123:15 - 123:22)
and then you have you have uh a c (123:18 - 123:24)
customer problem of these people coming (123:22 - 123:26)
into my stream and not just knowing how (123:24 - 123:28)
they work and they don&#39;t need to know (123:26 - 123:30)
how they work but there are so there (123:28 - 123:32)
were so many people that were like why (123:30 - 123:38)
are you just walking around fix it like (123:32 - 123:41)
no not how that works right right and so (123:38 - 123:44)
it&#39;s like explaining like the only thing (123:41 - 123:48)
I do as a Creator is say yes turn this (123:44 - 123:51)
on or no turn this off there&#39;s no like (123:48 - 123:53)
button I can hit on the back end it&#39;s (123:51 - 123:55)
not like let me put my backpack down and (123:53 - 123:57)
let me like toggle some twitch settings (123:55 - 123:59)
there&#39;s nothing I can do on the back end (123:57 - 124:01)
to fix it so it&#39;s like explaining that (123:59 - 124:03)
to somebody who just doesn&#39;t know right (124:01 - 124:05)
because it&#39;s like well it&#39;s your channel (124:03 - 124:08)
you must it must be your fault that it&#39;s (124:05 - 124:10)
not working or they&#39;ll be like do who (124:08 - 124:12)
whose channel can I go to where it&#39;s (124:10 - 124:13)
working it&#39;s like that&#39;s not how it (124:12 - 124:16)
works buddy so it&#39;s like I had a meeting (124:13 - 124:19)
with Mr Pikachu of like explaining like (124:16 - 124:22)
if there was like a status page that I (124:19 - 124:23)
could send them to like (124:22 - 124:26)
status. pookemon rewards.com to be like (124:23 - 124:28)
hey we&#39;re currently experiencing issues (124:26 - 124:31)
but also there there are there were also (124:28 - 124:32)
people that were like this isn&#39;t working (124:31 - 124:34)
and it&#39;s like well did you link your (124:32 - 124:36)
trainer Club account like well that (124:34 - 124:37)
that&#39;s the that&#39;s the other thing is (124:36 - 124:39)
like I found the even when the drops are (124:37 - 124:43)
working people don&#39;t read and so any any (124:39 - 124:45)
stream I&#39;m in whether it&#39;s yours or (124:43 - 124:48)
someone else&#39;s or whatever like the chat (124:45 - 124:50)
is just full of people going I don&#39;t (124:48 - 124:51)
understand or like they&#39;re doing like (124:50 - 124:53)
the slash drop because they think that&#39;s (124:51 - 124:56)
somehow going to make it work people are (124:53 - 124:59)
obsessed with right and and it&#39;s just (124:56 - 125:02)
trying to you know you see the host just (124:59 - 125:04)
constantly being like you need to go and (125:02 - 125:06)
do this you need to go it&#39;s like or they (125:04 - 125:07)
just ignore them and the chat just (125:06 - 125:08)
becomes completely (125:07 - 125:11)
useless right or like with the Hawaii (125:08 - 125:13)
thing they would they would say like (125:11 - 125:15)
Drop completed where&#39;s my Pikachu and (125:13 - 125:17)
it&#39;s like you don&#39;t get the Pikachu you (125:15 - 125:20)
get a quest line now you have to go do (125:17 - 125:21)
that quest line but that&#39;s not where (125:20 - 125:22)
they&#39;re looking they&#39;re not looking in (125:21 - 125:24)
the quest line area they&#39;re looking in (125:22 - 125:27)
their inventory for a Pikachu were the (125:24 - 125:29)
quests not also because they had one day (125:27 - 125:30)
was meant to be Pikachu and one day was (125:29 - 125:32)
meant to be Sab ey but I think they end (125:30 - 125:34)
up accidentally swapping the days so (125:32 - 125:36)
it&#39;s like people were like where is my (125:34 - 125:39)
Pikachu I&#39;ve just got Sab ey yep so (125:36 - 125:40)
maybe we&#39;ll be getting this research (125:39 - 125:44)
with alaria instead of her alligator (125:40 - 125:46)
Alia one worked great it worked great (125:44 - 125:48)
when it happened I don&#39;t know what they (125:46 - 125:53)
did between niic and worlds but it (125:48 - 125:55)
yeah (125:53 - 125:58)
so who who knows it but it&#39;s it&#39;s like (125:55 - 125:59)
it&#39;s cool that they do these things but (125:58 - 126:01)
it&#39;s part of the reason why sometimes (125:59 - 126:03)
watching twitch chat is just unbearable (126:01 - 126:06)
because it&#39;s like like even using me as (126:03 - 126:08)
an example like I&#39;m sure people want to (126:06 - 126:09)
come in they want to see Hawaii they (126:08 - 126:10)
want to see worlds they want to see (126:09 - 126:13)
Pokemon go and it&#39;s like half the time (126:10 - 126:16)
I&#39;m just answering questions of like and (126:13 - 126:17)
I can&#39;t imagine as a viewer you&#39;re (126:16 - 126:20)
sitting there for like four hours being (126:17 - 126:24)
like I know all of these questions too (126:20 - 126:28)
like like gosh like like Yep this is the (126:24 - 126:31)
300th time I&#39;ve heard Steve say did you (126:28 - 126:34)
properly link your trainer Club (126:31 - 126:39)
account yeah um so uh I don&#39;t know I (126:34 - 126:41)
gave I gave Mr Pikachu feedback I I (126:39 - 126:42)
think it&#39;s cool that there&#39;s a quest (126:41 - 126:45)
line for like for alligator but I wish (126:42 - 126:47)
it was like closer to the scarlet and (126:45 - 126:49)
violet thing where it&#39;s like this is (126:47 - 126:52)
this person&#39;s exact for alligator that (126:49 - 126:55)
you can use um but the other option as (126:52 - 126:57)
well as they could do cuz cuz I think (126:55 - 126:59)
one of the the other problems with it (126:57 - 127:02)
being in go is that as we talked about a (126:59 - 127:04)
lot of people have a feraligator and (127:02 - 127:06)
they&#39; probably powered up quite people (127:04 - 127:07)
that care anyway would have it powered (127:06 - 127:10)
up they could do instead of like here&#39;s (127:07 - 127:12)
the specific Pokemon they could do (127:10 - 127:14)
here&#39;s a bunch of candy for that Pokemon (127:12 - 127:15)
to help you power up your existing one (127:14 - 127:19)
and also they talk about using the elite (127:15 - 127:22)
TM here&#39;s a TM for you to use in instead (127:19 - 127:24)
you know that sort of thing there are (127:22 - 127:26)
other options for them to do these (127:24 - 127:29)
things I think for worlds they did give (127:26 - 127:30)
an elite TM I think one of the (127:29 - 127:33)
researches was an elite TM right for (127:30 - 127:36)
worlds that wouldn&#39;t surprise me I I (127:33 - 127:37)
lost track there were so many different (127:36 - 127:38)
things at Worlds I lost there were a lot (127:37 - 127:41)
of drops for worlds I know because they (127:38 - 127:45)
weren&#39;t working and I had to hear about (127:41 - 127:45)
them um that&#39;s fine (127:46 - 127:53)
uh cool though so keep an eye out for (127:50 - 127:57)
the shiny peler um uh I&#39;ll I&#39;ll post on (127:53 - 127:59)
social media when that code goes live uh (127:57 - 128:01)
