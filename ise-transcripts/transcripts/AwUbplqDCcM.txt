you what's up everyone welcome to the 250 first episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective is this is this generation 3 is this where we are is 251 gen 3 2 51 is Celebi no oh yeah 250 don't get ahead of yourself sir i was getting i got too excited with me today we still have one good episode i'm your host this bj don't know if i said that but with me today i have Travis yeah I have realized that people take what I say in the show way too seriously because there was a joking but still have furnace discussion of whether or not I should keep keep that dog clean in 2017 for the entire year or whether that would get old and frankly I promise you I'll forget it in like two weeks two more times two more times holding you to that this week we plan on reading Travis's email from I'm just giving tips I'm gonna I'm just gonna keep teasing that for for two more episodes who will is also two episodes when Travis forgets uh keeping the dog cloning all right Will's here yeah insert goof here I'm not we're out of our regular time zone dude I'm not in phase yeah yeah I normally we record this on Sunday mornings but travis has some things to do tomorrow and I amo quote quote things thing things to do I just need to go to work it's not that exciting it actually so I have no problem waking up early to do things and moving things around but i'm actually watching Japanese wrestling tonight which is live at midnight my time which means it probably won't end till 4am my time so normally I'm cool with waking up early to record stuff but when I already have something that's going to keep me up til 4am I'm not so not so on that bandwagon of getting up early so you're going to be watching boat race sponsored new japan pro sling a fine bushiroad product you are correct the the finest of boat racing products we got a show for you guys today but let me let me lay out the show real quick before we get off topic are we got some pokemon news and then we have actually the show will probably be just poked by news because there's actually quite a bit of it and then we'll move on to a couple emails and then we're going to do our pokemon of the week so no dedicated middle topic but i think there are some talking points in this news and we just did a two-hour live show last week which is kind of what I wanted to talk about because we don't do live shows that often and whatnot but let's let's start there what do you what did you guys think of last week two hours of our faces on on the internet and then I took that into took that into post and you know brought down some stuff that might have not been audio only that might not have worked on an audio-only stuff so I took some stuff out I probably cut 20 minutes from the live show into the audio version but overall overall what are you guys his thoughts on on what we did well my mom had a lot of criticisms your mom wrote in she gave you a call let you know that she didn't approve my chest been hat hey talk to my mom every day and I was not the one she was disapproving of boy I was Travis in such a dark room I don't have a very good can make everything look very dark I can't i'm not i'm not gonna buy a new computer for the two times a year we do a live show I don't even know you're doing video Steve just said we'll do a live show oh yeah now here's a skype video call which I guess I should have just assumed as if we do video as if we're a video podcast or something I wasn't prepared the turning on and off the light didn't do anything so it was dead I'm sorry wills mom mrs. Anderson you mrs. Anderson are truster you were you using your your computer's webcam was that yeah I don't have another webcam I don't I don't any video products with well I mean I do but if I do I'm using like what I don't have any like did I don't I don't use that webcam for anything I cha I I have a bunch of logitech c920 s laying around i should just send you one i should tell you a lot of stuff i have a lot of stuff that you probably benefit from that I have extra of but I should probably send you that stuff before you go to Canada before you get deported because that's not still not funny because I don't want to pay the shipping to Canada there's a significant price difference from [Music] Wisconsin to Michigan than Wisconsin to Canada even though they're correct remotely like the same distance away a little farther up to Winnipeg but sure but where are we on on the the Canadian endeavors same as we were last week waiting for a group of people to decide whether or not the university I went to is reputable all right you know which accreditation agency accredits Sweet Valley College oh I went to Grand Valley State University the acrid ation association i guess is how you would say it is the international creational can't even say international credit Association know something it's icas it's like I cas Canada I forget what the for what let you know which u.s. accreditation agency manages Sweet Valley State no I do not mmm you think every college student would know which accreditation agency accredits their school hmm I don't kids out there do your research I'm just getting I the show isn't even been going for a full ten minutes and I am are just getting lamb basted whether it's the lighting of my room or it's the legitimacy of my bachelor's degree I can't catch a break we haven't even been on for 10 minutes now and I'm feeling so attacked yes that is a great recapitulation of what i feel and said Steve yeah yeah have a good time poor me so back to topic 250 quite a milestone six almost seven years seven years in july 250 episodes i do have some minor changes to the not not so much the form up but how we do the podcast more behind the scenes than actually maybe stuff that might not be noticed offhand recently the last couple episodes we've been trying a different way of recording so it sounds a bit better and a couple people on twitter notice and asked if travis and will got new mics and they they didn't not yet i do plan on getting them even even different mics from the last time we did last time we did a hardware upgrade but just a different way of recording which takes more time to to edit but we're working on that we're working through the kinks so if if you did notice any audio if you didn't notice differences in audio and the last couple episodes we are trying a different different way of doing things so providing any feedback good or bad if you've noticed that yeah i don't i don't know 250 episodes is a big one I is a big milestone and I enjoyed the live episode and it seemed like like the chat really enjoyed the live episode even though we didn't really focus on chat that much but you guys have any is that something you two would be willing to do more of in the future or just what are your thoughts on that I mean I'll have to ask wills I'll have to ask mrs. Anderson if she's okay with it well she lets just have to approve all lighting and backgrounds before it occurs I mean she didn't like Steve either so don't worry too much what my lighting was like on point she wasn't complaining about your lighting sir oh she complaining about the amount of Soylent I drink during a show no gotta stay hydrated just your general temperament listen along those lines yet general opinions alright well you know if your mom should leave a review in itunes let us know how I think she has all right well let's let's dive into spoke my news here I'm sure I'm forgetting a bunch of stuff but uh I'm really I'm really thrown off off here but suppose my news first bit of news is there is a new Pikachu themed new Nintendo 3ds XL going on sale starting on februari 24th at one hundred ninety nine dollars fifty dollars left's in the switch you heard it here first right right around the pokemons 21st birthday nothing really special about it it's is it the one with the cute like it's got the full Pikachu like it's kind of like like it's gonna pounce on you that one it's the one with Pikachu like laying down and it's more of like chalk art than it is lineart more of an outline and yeah but it like a rough outline like it was used with like a cha like a chalk stick or a color pencil or a paint brush that loses ink loses paint too fast paintbrush that I'm gonna lose it ain't too fast well this is riveting I need to get one of these I may be getting one will see why you already have a new Nintendo 3ds yeah but my see stick is not working too well all right as I monster hunter dit too much but you could 49 day if you waited nine days and paid 50 more dollars you could get the latest and greatest in Nintendo's portable handheld systems but that doesn't have Monster Hunter on it that's true or does it have pokemons on it that's both are valid points but you gotta you gotta buy the hardware when it does it does have the Zelda's on it but let's be real I'm not a big zelda fan I is getting the puyo puyo tetris though that's like in a year once no no that's gross spring of 2007 ring spring so April 33rd yeah puyo puyo tetris will show up on the switch get that I know your I know you're a big Mario Kart 8 fan will oh yeah oh yeah definitely played tons of that yep yep second bit of news here is Pokemon Sun and Moon incredible success means the 3d esas future is bright I don't really agree with this headline but it's more so this is off polygon it has to do with the UH this was let me get the date right January 31st nintendo announced that it sold 14.6 9 million copies of pokemon sun and moon by the end of 2016 that span was between november 18 through the december 31st so only 44 days which means on average they were selling three hundred and thirty-four thousand copies each day I think it is already outsold x and y and no I outsold Omega Ruby alpha sapphire I think it's on its way to outselling x and y if i'm not mistake more pokemon than they've added i only like the hearse first 150 after that they kind of ran out of ideas am i right haha up top there's actually quite a quite a bit in this article currently the best-selling 3ds game of all time is pokemons previous Pokemon adventure 2013 copy uh 2,000 to the the 2013 pokemon X&Y with 16 point 06 million copies pretty sure Sun and Moon is going to pass that next on the list was Mario Kart 7 with 14.8 2 million copies that debuted in 2011 poet Langston was that for 3ds oh did I get that I don't think you got seven Pokemon games like I know wills 3ds I mean I brenna mario kart but maybe it was mario kart DS that was that's easily one of the best mario karts I'll go on record saying that Pokemon games aren't the only 3ds titles that are performing well Nintendo said that 3ds 3ds software sales were up twenty percent year-over-year in the third quarter Super Mario maker for 3ds and Kirby planet row boat 0 robo-bot both were released in 2016 are also million sellers two thousand two million copies for Super Mario maker 1.3 million copies for planet robobot this bodes well for the future of Nintendo's 3ds which Nintendo said will stick around as a dedicated handheld platform I know they said that but that's not true this year's 3d software lineup it will include two entries from the popular Fire Emblem series as well as a Pikmin game the franchise first handheld title that means Pikmin not fire emblem third-party games including Square Enix Dragon Quest a portable version of Dragon Quest 8 will be coming as well as well as Dragon Quest 11 it says Nintendo also reported sales of 6.4 million 3ds units in its third fiscal quarter year which is up ten percent year-over-year this includes both editions of the 3ds just say it doesn't say to do so I'm not sure with with that but there you go after this after 2017 though the 3ds will be on the on the cutting board of the food cutting board of life which means going into the garbage because when you cut a strawberry top you only keep the bottom of the strawberry which is then attend a switch and then you throw away the top of the strawberry which is the 3ds so at the end of him the 2d s and the studious so at the end of 2 sot 2017 the top of the strawberry is going in the garbage did you follow me Travis oh no I mean I you know how quickly it it takes for me to just stop paying attention to what you're saying and you're throwing out all these numbers about like fire emblem and console sales I I mean I'm with the listener here I tuned out ages ago oh no our listeners love numbers and our listeners love lists yeah that that those are facts those are i guess i'm not a listener of this program hey did you all speaking of fire of them did you i'll try the fire emblem iOS game a hands we know when i'm too busy to you i'm too busy with my brand loyalty I've been playing pokemon duel wait didn't last week you didn't play pokemon do no i did play pokemon duel last week but i didn't get to play a lot of it because i got through the tutorial and then I kind of had to like record the show or something I can't remember why I stopped playing okay tutorial but I hear you I hear a tutorial give me give me my give me the pokemon duel update what are you out here the game itself is fun the UI is still bad is it does it crash a lot is it slow a sluggish it is slow it is sluggish I don't I haven't had experience with crashes um but a lot of the time if you've suspended the app for a long time and then go back into it it does require that you close out of the app and relaunch it which is unfortunate but the actual playing of the game itself doesn't have to be that sluggish it's generally just navigating through the menus and accepting your login bonuses that can be a hassle but the game itself is fun I heard it's very are and i have not played it yet because i wanted to stream it i heard there were a lot of issues with the slowish in the sluggishness so i haven't opened it yet but i heard that it's very luck based more luck so than the actual like video game competition I mean speak to that yes I would say there is more luck involved than in VGC but I so the way it works is I think I mentioned this before but you've got a grid and you have a set of Pokemon you and each Pokemon has a different number of movement points by which they move the number of movement points is equal to the number of squares that they can move in a turn and the goal is to get to your opponent's goal square which is on the opposite side of the field from you unless your Pokemon has some specific abilities you generally cannot just walk through opponents and need to engage them in combat to defeat them in order to continue on your quest to getting to your opponent's square that combat is completely determined by RNG your Pokemon have essentially a move set and a wheel spins to determine what move you use and same for your opponent and then while there are exceptions like status moose function differently and there are moves with essentially increased priority but other than those extraneous factors generally the Pokemon who rolls the higher number within their moveset wins and the other Pokemon is knocked out so that it's completely random and can be very frustrating but more of the strategy and more of the time you spend playing is is actually in the placement and positioning rather of your pieces so it's less about you're not really even engaging in combat a return and in fact it's more about like making sure your units are placed in such a way that you're defending your base while also having ones that can sort of advance on your opponent's squares and r square rather um and it's really more about where you move your pieces then is about the combat the combat just happens to be how it resolves I guess stalemates in a way hmm it sounds slightly similar to fire emblem minus the Fire Emblem the iOS version minus the whole orangey stuff fire emblem is just like moving your your pieces in a way where you're going to have the biggest advantage and it's the whole green is good against blue blue is good against red red is good against green kind of thing I have never played a fire emblem there well I don't know how different the iOS version is from a main Fire Emblem is there there's no type advantage in duel is there I don't think so there is not okay but there are matchups between Pokemon that are better than others based on abilities and move sets for example latios is a very strong piece so a lot of people will put specific pokemon in their squad that are able to defeat latios that um that have a higher chance of being able to defeat that specific Pokemon so there are their matchups that are more favorable but it doesn't fall on type advantage ya know that's like that's similar in fire emblem where is if you have somebody if you have a unit that is like floaty that is on a Pegasus a flying horse they're more likely to you they can easily be defeated by any of the archer units or if there is like somebody who is wearing armor they only move one space at a time where other pieces can move like for three or four spaces that time but the there are certain units that can like breakthrough are more easily so depending on the matchup you would want to bring in different units they they both like how you're describing duelin again I haven't played it and I've only played a couple hours of the the Fire Emblem iOS game they seem like games that appeal to the same types of players that like that strategy game that just sounds like Pokemon is a little more rng based and of course the theme matters a lot because if you've never played a fire emblem that might not do it for you and of course if you're not into Pokemon why would you ever download pokemon duel but but both those games serve the purpose of you know getting people more involved outside of the series right like that's what pokemon go did really well was and microtransactions right do you have you spent any money in duel no do you know what the price things are off off the bat like what are you buying in duel I'm sure you looked at it there is a second as with many free-to-play games there's a secondary currency called jewels gems jewels and they're called jewels that you you can receive them just naturally through primarily through login bonuses where if you log in every day you get a certain number of jewels and there are a few things that you can buy with Jules I think you can there might be some way of buying figures purely with jewels although I'm not sure about that I haven't seen that particularly the one thing I know that you can use jewels for is to speed up the unlock of your prize chests so the way it works is when you win a match you are rewarded with a booster box and most of the and so the booster boxes you received our time so a rarer one will take a full 24 hours to unlock a common one will take one hour to unlock you can spend gems to open them aamir jewels to open them immediately that's the only thing for sure I know you can spend jewels on but I think there might also be some way to exchange your jewels for material which then you can use to buy specific pieces but there are other ways of generating material as well I have not felt the need to spend any money on it most I mean I don't ever plan on doing it but I really don't have any incentive now because I haven't played the game enough to really know what pieces I should be going for which pieces I should be upgrading because I just don't know that the the meta enough to know if I'm wasting all of my all of my rare rare metal see or my ingot ours or my uh there's also a third one I forget there's a lot of strange currencies and resources that it takes a while to learn the yellow ones you sell for coins the blue ones give you experience the green ones upgrade your sea level and I know I don't know what that is like ocean level no the letter C but I don't see how you would find that misunderstanding well what were you gonna say I wasn't going to say anything except that I have never had any compelling reason to play any fire emblem anything and people have like described the game to me and the more they describe the game to me the less interested I become it just doesn't sound like fun that's the doc that's the Doctor Who effect hey doctor who is greater the morphe I've watched a lot of Doctor Who in my day but you would be lying if you said the more someone talks about Doctor Who the less you want to think about Doctor Who Doctor Who's pretty terrible um what I I couldn't even make has its ups and downs the first episode which was something with a garbage can and like somebody turned into a garbage can or their they came out of a garbage can okay there's we all like different things let's just leave it right there fire emblem I just don't understand so I was a big fan of the advanced War series which is made by the same team that makes fire emblem and I think a lot of my bitterness for the Fire Emblem series despite the fact that Nintendo likes to make a million fire emblems I think there are like beside with this iOS game that just came out there three more Fire Emblem games planned and I feel like we just got a hundred other Fire Emblem games in the last two years well yeah they did the one that was like you could do the one side or the other side and then you could get the third one that was the other side's other side yeah faiths are awake in the end like that for a for fruit game obviously there's besides my time investment there's it's not costing me anything to play and I have played fire emblems in like a long long long long long time ago like when it was super nintendo or wherever it was I can't even remember somebody's gonna write in a very angry email that I don't know I'm talking about that's fine because I don't I just remember I played a really old fireman game and I enjoyed it but I really enjoyed the advanced war series that being said I think Fire Emblem heroes which is the iOS game is really fun and I see why people like it so much and I'll just say this before we move on I think the the big appeal is it has the same appeal of Pokemon of instead of really liking a certain pokemon or certain creatures or you know evolutionary lines you end up really liking certain characters or fighters and that's why somebody like Roy or Marth who are in the smash brothers games are very popular because they're just characters that people can relate to just like people really like vanilluxe or Charizard or Lucario and I don't understand the love of Luke re I do what I actually do understand the lover Lucario but for joking purposes I don't understand the love of Lucario just like I don't understand the love of Mars but those two are the same where people can relate to it in some way and they just end up being favorites so when you're playing fire emblem heroes at least for me somebody who is not into that series it's very easy to start getting these new characters and then instantly starting to like certain characters just based on their outfits or the way they look or all the characters do have a personality where you can click on them and tap them to make them say something and the two or three lines of dialogue the two or three lines of dialogue they say is very easy to get a feel of what kind of personality they have which then plays in part of why you might find yourself liking that character more and just like in Pokemon you have all these characters at your disposal but you pick for to go into battle with you at a time and then you level up and they learn new moves and stuff so it it it does fit this it does fit in a way that Pokemon fits in a way of those two audiences crossing over with each other it's like in a kitchen if you take a cup of milk and a bottle of chocolate syrup and you mix it together those cross over into each other just like I'm done with these food analogies what else do we have for now it's like are you sending secret messages to some foreign spy Confederacy with these batteries charged middle just get activated valentine's Day is coming up and Pokemon Center has updated their their lineup of merchandise I don't know why this is news but I think sometimes we forget that Pokemon Center exists and they do add a lot of stuff but for valentine's day there is a a slowpoke shirt there are SPN and Umbreon coffee mugs and i know those are two very popular Pokemon there are some Valentine's Day heart / note cards with envelopes and then there is a five pack pin set that you can get which features Pikachu Evie umbreon s pre espy on and slow poke so those are all in the Pokemon Center the other bit of news I wanted to piggyback off that is they are adding plushies from Sun and Moon to Pokemon Center I'm sure a lot of listeners or just Pokemon fans in general or waiting for a mimic you plush which I don't think exists yeah I know it exists but it doesn't exist in the English Pokemon Center but they did just add kamala togi Dimauro rock rough and pika peck in plush form in the Pokemon Center so I know that that is that is exciting in itself because I think those pokemon are great and I think Pokemon Center is great and it is good if you if money's no good in the bank so if you need to find a way to dispose of it Pokemon Center is a good outlet for that other better news here is the Pokemon advanced complete collection is going to be released in north america speaking of generation 3 the complete DVD boxset because we still are on that technology of the sixth english dubbed pokemon series pokemon advanced will be released in north america on May sixteenth this box set contains five discs those will be considered region 1 which means they can only be played in blah blah according to the back image cover on Amazon the set contains 23 hours of

different name but I'm not gonna look it up for you all right good it is the Paleozoic Pokemon really it's a more appropriate that doesn't sound is interested in diving jetta sec school and has a good look good theme ah that's that's all i have for news i don't know if i'm missing anything i believe there was a pokemon go update and it made some fixes for apple watch but i have not tried it yet so we I'm being a recent owner of an Apple watch as opposed to last weekend you said you don't have the series to right correct i have series 1 which is different than series 0 which was the original apple watch and but yours doesn't have GPS built in right correct mine doesn't have GPS and it doesn't have the waterproofing but i don't know how to swim so i didn't need the waterproofing also i didn't find the gps to be that beneficial because i can never imagine going outside my house for a run without my phone because what i can imagine that but um so my question is possibly all of the issues you were having were because of the lack of GPS so I've got to give it a try since I've got the I've got the series to know it has nothing to do with sufficient it has to do with the fact that the app would crash after 20 seconds because behind because crashing as it was trying to access a GPS no because it pulls off your phone though the only difference between the GPS and the watch and the GPS without the watch is it pulls from your phone's GPS and let me tell you my phone's GPS is fine you have it used to also also always complain about delete getting delays in getting notifications for things and I've never had that problem either I've never had that problem will you talk about somebody used to complain about that check your Twitter history all right give you an update out of my 74 thousand tweets well what we'll do now is we'll take a quick break when we come back we're going to talk about we're going to cover some emails and we're going to give you your Pokemon of the week done a Sun Dance a big dan dance I've done a dud dance Big Damn dance I've done a flood dance a Big Damn dance abundance Sundance up done done games I'm done damn abundance [Music] damn David abundance [Music] Oh [Music] and we are back from our break we are a couple emails go through and our poke amount of the week I do really like the email segment so I wanted to make sure that we try to at least do a handful especially since I have such a backlog of emails but if you want to email us anything pokemon or non pokemon related will definitely try to tackle it on the show here that email is SBJ at pkmn cast calm or just go to pokemon podcast calm hit that contact button either way the emails go to the same place so the first email is from matt from webster matchy-matchy xuxa seeeeee massachusetts hey guys I love the show and listen every week usually with my girlfriend who finds the show hilarious with banter my question that i have is looking to do a podcast about magic the gathering lower and i was wondering how you managed the time to do everything in the podcast and everything related to it and any advice you could all give me i'm a huge fan of the host but wills will shines above the rest in my house even with my six year olds laughs at the sarcasm he adds thank you for your hard work and entertainment my favorite pokemon is Umbreon without a doubt i would a pokemon center has some stuff for you also good luck to Travis with their Canadian move thanks the thing about will sarcasm I appreciate the luck wishes the thing about will sarcasm is that when he dragged me through the dirt he's not being sarcastic I'm a very disappointed aunty I can only be as I am you you both have other podcasts which rack which you should pit pimp ugh so go ahead pimp your pimp your podcast and then you know give me give me what you do to maybe prepare or just set that show up well Travis you go first because yours is much less niche than my okay yeah I do a show called arbitrary archive it's a culture of you show we take a random well in the fiction we receive a thematic suggestion from a sentient AI named Jeff but in reality we're just taking a random word generator and then using that random word as our theme for the following week were like for example this upcoming episode the word that was randomly generated was demolish meant so we both had to pick a piece of media that fit within that category and then we talked about why it's worthwhile or not worthwhile and we do that every week the thing that I came down to with the process with that show is because unlike it's super effective where there's a sense in which we're covering news or any like breaking content the keys to just record in advance right so it doesn't matter when we recorded the show for arbitrary archive because the content is the same regardless of whether we recorded at a week ago or not so generally it's actually not true of right now but generally our process is to have at least one episode recorded in advance so if something comes up we only need to edit and instead of having to add a and record in case we get busy and I think that really helps with being able to fit your release schedule and be consistent with it not that we've been perfectly consistent but you know we haven't we've only missed one week I think and and I think that's the key right is to have that sort of buffer there and it sounds like if you're just covering magic lord that it would be a similar circumstance for you that you wouldn't necessarily need to be covering the latest magic the gathering news because that's not your subject matter so that would be my suggestion are you sure they don't want the latest magic the gathering news as part of the program well I mean the email writer said they're covering lower so that we don't like storing information and lore and like this stuff about a like Jase I think is a magic the gathering character or the one like angel or lack notice that is a magic the guidance Black Lotus that's a that's a thing in magic together the probably the problem with your argument is that as they come out with new cards that adds to the lore so they'll want to discuss those cards and sure my reason I mean they even then that's that's not happening every week so you know you might sometime need to have an episode like well I'm even then okay so you might need to have have an episode that's current if they just announced all of the new cards for the new set and then you want to talk about them or whatever but you could also have a few episodes recorded unlike lore from purses legacy and it doesn't matter when you recorded that because it's already old well that's true I I don't have Steve I don't know the the podcast space that involves magic the gathering but I would assume that a lot of podcast in that space are probably about the metagame and the most recent stuff so I would assume that there aren't a lot of podcasts specifically about the lore so if that is the case i feel like matt has a slight advantage and that's something that it's super effective had the advantage in back in back when we started and and something that will spot cast drive check has an advantage in because that market wasn't at the time when it's super effective started that market wasn't saturated yet which is which is kind of my advice which is let me let me explain a bit I might have explained this before but just to like recap before it's super effective I had a video game only podcast because at the time I only listen to video game podcast like general video game podcast where they talk about everything what's new coming up what they're playing and what not and that space is extremely crowded it's very hard to stand up just like it's very hard to stand out as like a twitch streamer or YouTube streamer the same thing in podcast and I it's it's harder nowadays than it was back in you know 2010 we're not a lot of people knew what podcasts were I wasn't satisfied with the game coverage with the game the generalized game coverage kind of skipping pokemon that's when I went out and I sought to find a podcast that would talk about Pokemon which ended up being not a lot of podcasts and I've said there were there were Pokemon specific podcast of the time but they were either on hiatus or they weren't burning out they weren't putting out weekly episodes or whatnot and that's when I decided to make my own show and that really fit that void of okay no one else is really doing this and even though I'm not doing it very well and I can assure you the first you know dozens of episodes of its super fective were bad they were not good ah but I was doing it weekly and I was trying to do something that no one else was consistently at the time like I said there were other Pokemon podcast but might the key word i was using there is consistency and so that's kind of my advice is if there are no other magic the gathering lower podcast then you're already in or you're already in a good place the the second key to that equation is to do that consistently and I a lot of people can look at a list of podcast and go oh this podcast only have has like 10 episodes 10 episodes is a lot like 10 episodes is over two months of content if you're doing it weekly and you should and you should make sure you hit a schedule it wasn't it's not until you have a good listener ship under your belts and and good as good as relative to what you want to achieve if a good listener ship to you is a hundred people listening a week that's awesome if a good listener ship to you as a thousand people listening the week that that that metric is just up to you and what you you want to get out of it but once you feel like you have it you have a good number if you have a good listener ship that's when you can you know take a week off because it's Christmas or delay an episode of day because you know you're you're just sick and you can't bed but i think it is what to piggyback off what Travis said maybe record one or two episodes in advance in case you're sick in case an emergency comes up in case you're you're swamped at work because consistency in the podcast field is really important and I think being different is also really important you could go out right now and start a Nintendo podcast but I don't know how that podcast is going to be different than other Nintendo podcasts that have already been doing it that have proven and had a track record of consistency an established audience base you gotta remember that people only have a specific amount of time in a week to listen to shows and as much as I love podcasts I have cut a lot of podcasts out of my life just because I didn't like one of the hosts and maybe that's why a lot of people who listen to the superfecta visitor like I can't stand Steve but um and I say I don't like one of the hosts and I mean that because if I don't like one of the hosts or I don't like one of the personalities I can find another podcast that talks about that topic that I do like the hosts on and that's what I mean when I say that but yeah so find finally finding or doing something that stands out than other shows does help there was a time where I thought about doing a splatoon podcast because I did believe that there was enough information and community there to do that weekly and even with splatoon like not doing there like they're there mending their their monthly events or stop releasing weapons every week I do think that there was a good five or six months where I could have done a split splatoon podcast which is about like 25 30 episodes and it probably would have done pretty well because that community in itself is pretty active i'm sure the Magic the Gathering community for lower is pretty active so I think you have something there but like look what's what's not being done and try to fill that void and if that's the case for you then you're on a good start but just like Travis said I think consistency is a big part I gave you a really long answers all that will talk now well so you know drive check is also about a collectible card game so in some ways I can relate in there is a ton of lore in cardfight Vanguard you know primarily because it derives first off from somebody who wanted it to be like manga and anime so it has all those tropes built into the actual game and then there's an actual manga and an actual anime that go along with the card game but the three things i would add on to what Steven Travis said are if if you want to do a podcast it is not a one night a week thing you're probably going to need to dedicate at least a portion of three nights a week number one figure out what you're going to be talking about when you actually do record and document that you want you know for a drive check we do a what we call the program notes every week where we put together the actual topics that we're going to be talking about so that when everybody gets together we all know what we're actually going to be talking about and then if any of those require research and if you are doing a lower podcast you probably want to do some research into the background of where things come from people can take the time to do that research then you need a night where you're actually going to record and if you're recording like if your goal is to say record half an hour to 45 minutes then you know always double the amount of time that you're planning especially when you're first starting out because it just takes that time especially if you're recording with people in different locations across the country to get the people all in the same place at the same time and up and ready to record and prepared and everything like that and then your third night is actually editing what you record which really involves listening to what you recorded over again not sped up and actually catching anything that needs to be cut out any silences that go on for too long if there's some clicking in the background that you need to cut out anything like that and then if you want to add any audio effects that's the time when you do that so you know like recently in drive check there were two card games that have died so i added in you know a trumpet playing taps as we were discussing those card games dying but you know i had to find that audio file and integrated into the recording and make sure that that just asked me i play the trumpet i did not know that you know playtex i need next time I need a recording of taps I will ask you to submit also but yet but then you have to adjust the audio levels for that recording make sure that's not overpowering the voices and everything and then of course you know if you are doing people who are recording over skype then you've got multiple tracks to manage and you have to have an audio editing software package that you use or two or three I wait I only use two at this point in time but yeah I mean it's you're gonna it takes time right it's not oh my buddies are gonna sit down for half an hour a week and we're just gonna plop that on the internet because you guess what nobody's gonna listen to that also get good microphones yeah dad don't don't skip on the microphones absolutely the your iphone headphones microphone no bueno don't don't go down that path so yeah just you know be prepared to make a time commitment and then when you combine that time commitment with consistency boy it becomes actual work so be prepared yeah the work of it the last thing I'll say which will validate will which might be a what might be a first on the show is the time know which is the time thing I think for it's super effective there there is that exception because we've been doing this for so long with so Travis and will and no offense to you guys but you guys do little to no work besides showing up correct that is very true and so you show up I I lay out the ILA at the game plan and and we go we normally do that sunday morning and then I I'll actually edit it at night before I go to bed on Sunday I usually wait till Irene goes to bed I edit it and then I go to bed and then that way when I wake up it's hit all the RSS feeds and it's it's out first thing on Monday that's that's the rhythm there but with with the tuesday night podcast which is my board gaming podcast if you were to ask me over a year ago if doing a podcast was easy i probably would have said yes because I'm so used to Travis and will and I'm so used to the rhythm that we we've come to and I think we see that a lot in reviews and comments of people saying that we sound just like like friends in reality when we're not friends we hate each other so true so true but no we do have we do have this chemistry and that that didn't that wasn't apparent 150 episodes ago why bring up the tuesday night podcast is because i was doing I was hosting another podcast which I would have told you I've done that I've done i have two hundred fifty episodes under my belt I know how to host the podcast but doing that with like two new people that you know aren't familiar with podcasts but aren't familiar in like doing podcasts but are very good talkers and they can talk that that's for sure I I just felt like I wasn't achieving what I was achieving so easily with it's super effective and it was something that Brent me out and something that I've had a conversation with Sean and Alan about of like hey I loved doing the show but like this show is taking up too much time and I'm feeling burnt out and I don't even have time to play board games and no offense to you guys but like doing it's super effective is my priority it is like my baby of a podcast and I have to make sure that I have the energy to do that show and they were completely on your understanding and I've stepped away from that show now for for a little bit and I think that show is in a good place and I think Alan and Sean will handle that show well as I'm away yeah it's it I you know I did 60 60 some episodes of the tuesday night podcast and that's a lot that's like a that's a year straight and honestly I felt burnt out I felt like I can't do this again and and that that's still my show and that's still something that like I care about but I will eventually go back to that but I don't know what my original point is I think my original point was like podcasting is a lot more work than it just seems on paper it's it's l it's a lot more than three people sitting around and talking and that's not to say it's bad like if you want podcast go go podcast but it's it's not a it it's not free it's not it's not oh oh oh wait wait thank you for bringing that up it is not free you gotta pay that soundcloud monthly fee you're gonna have our very or Lisbon or wherever you decide to go by that we all do soundcloud uh you you want a website for your podcast you're paying the squarespace dudes ain't free and can I can I offer one more piece of advice yeah be very trepidatious if your co-hosts are going to be college students because college students who are in classes lack two things one a consistent schedule because even if you know what their class schedule is they might have a lot of homework to do that night that you were planning to record and all of a sudden there are no longer available to record and two college students don't have a lot of privacy so it's hard for them to have a quiet room to themselves where they won't have some other person walk in the room and start talking to them and they're like dude I'm recording and you like huh one more thing to edit out when I was in college and a part of the show I would go to like an abandoned wing of the of the housing building that I lived in and found just a very dark vacant room and would record from there I remember that remember that and then occasionally people would run by like playing hide and seek after they wandered into the the darkness that was that part of the building and that would ruin things but yeah it is it is a that is a concern make sure you have a place to record that is nice and and I would also mention that eventually you're going to figure out your and this is I mean I realized that question asker was asking mostly how to find the time to be able to do the show but we've sort of transitioned into just giving general advice I would say also eventually I think you'll find and your co-hosts if you have them will find their what their podcast persona or or voice is and I think it's okay to lean into that I certainly have a different personality on this show than I do in person it's sort of an exaggerated version of me I think that's important to do because you're supposed to be entertaining people and I think it's okay to be a little outrageous if that is the tonality of your show because at first you might think no I want to be the genuine real me sometimes and I mean this is me included people are kind of boring so it's okay to be a bit of a cartoon character if you need to be one hundred percent agree if your real-life personality is a stake and your podcast personality is on the cutting board of a salted steak and you grill that for an hour and 45 minutes you have yourself one heck of a podcast but thank you Matt for writing in that was a very long-winded answer second question second email here is from derek from los angeles california hey SBJ and the rest of the Pokemon crew I've been meaning to email you for a long time now but as with many things in life I haven't seemed to have the time to sit down and send an email after just listening to the 250th episode special I felt inspired to sit down and send in this email first off I wanted to say thank you for regularly putting out a high quality entertaining podcast I am 27 years old and some of the best childhood memories revolve around playing the first two generations of Pokemon games I took a decade and a half hiatus from Pokemon this ended on pokemon Day 2016 why when I felt inspired to go out to a local gamestop and pick up a 2d s that I could download and play through pokemon red again after flying through the game I decided I wanted to go back and play through all the different generations that I missed I guess that once you hit your once you hit your mid-20s you no longer care playing pokemon is cool anymore we have this a lot and I've expressed my same opinions for that in the year that has passed since Pokemon Day 2016 I've picked up and played through heartgold alpha sapphire X and both Sun and Moon most of these have played through two or three times your podcast has helped me fill huge gaps in my pokemon knowledge as well as inspired me to reach into the Pokemon back catalog and experience all these games for the first time I'm at a point now where it isn't a weekly episode I'm at a point now where there isn't a weekly episode that comes out that I don't listen to I teach middle school and Pokemon is an awesome way for me to connect with my students also my goal for 2017 is to have played through every main series Pokemon game which means I have some awesome new first ahead of me SBJ there's something you said during the 2015 special episode live episode that struck a chord with me you mentioned that will and Travis always tend to be fan favorites and you don't get many people who connect with you well SBJ I connect with you one of the things that got me interested in your podcast was finding out your twitter handle which seemed to be based off of abacus dragging the lake compilation albums from back in the day the first Atticus dragon-like album introduced me to bands that are still some of my favorites today including alkaline trio glass jaw the starting line the movie life which tracks based off the dragging Lake compilations are your favorite i'm now off to become a patreon backer cheers Derek long email thank you so much for writing in ah glad that our show has inspired you that that means a lot uh going off my twitter handle you might be the first person who's ever written in that like understood that reference which is great I don't listen to a lot of that music anymore but like punk pop growing up was a big influence to me especially the movie life know that I grew out of pop punk and I moved into hip-hop and then I grew out of that moved into just muse music with no lyrics and then I like went back to hip-hop and then I'm all over the place right now I listen to like like brain music like music that's supposed to help you focus which is like really weird and goes off on my whole like mindfulness and meditation thing but yeah I don't know do you guys have anything to piggyback off his email the easiest way to get your letter read on the program is to praise Steve obviously yeah I don't think this person is real i think this i think this is a plant also it is worth it is worth mentioning that probably the reason it's difficult for people to get the reference of your username is because dragging a lake is just a general term meaning looking at the bottom of a lake for an object usually in a criminal investigation and that would be why they might not make the action to whatever obscure pop punk thing that you're referencing that's true honestly I thought it was a reference to Elvis Costello's watching the detectives you know me I commit myself and I know I commit crimes and throw weapons and the lakes but no thank you for writing in no no no no you drag a lake if you're if you're looking for bodies dude no you can also direct I just don't want to get into the gruesome detail you could drag a like for weapons to Wikipedia it Google out if you are not a fan of or if you've never heard Elvis Costello is watching the detectives it is possibly one of his greatest song so I do recommend that everybody go out and give that song listen and see if it brings you to tears like it does me out of all I will show a mars volta song that references dragging little dragging a lake i think it's um yeah I don't like a little marble so no no mars volta is one of the greatest bands of all time no I don't think so but what are you one of those dudes who's like at the drive-in I don't listen to mars volta cuz i will take mars volta over at the drive-in no I don't I don't I don't care for at the drive-in either let's i had the drive-in live in their reunion tour and like their most recent reunion tour and that was like a religious experience I mean enjoy that but delousing the coma torium is one of the greatest albums that we've gotten Eric yeah I like deal aust more than like relationship of command but I would also say that because at the drive-in is so closely so ciated with that one record relationship of command as opposed to the previous more like emo work that they did that I think they can you can sort of feel like at the drive and never made bad music even though they did because they made some bad stuff before relationship of command but with mars volta like delouse is their best album Francis them you is pretty dang good no one should ever talk about am patek sure ah bedlam in goliath is pretty decent and then it really goes downhill from there so it's like Mars yet mars volta like in recent memory it hasn't been as good as like d lost in the coma torium I mean that's okay and everybody can't be at their best at all times the the dragging dragging the leak albums I think there were three of them if if my memory serves me right they were they were compilations of like a bunch of POC pop punk bands and I know it was started by the the guys from blink 182 let me tell you a BAM that doesn't actually hold up very well blink-182 wrong I did like Tom and Mark or they just cannot sing they're just not good as I could sing yeah exactly my 16 year old me would have told you differently but boy that music doesn't really hope I'm inai I have no shame and saying like I still think fall out boys really good and I know a lot of people don't like fall out boy and that's fine I whatever music like music is music but out of like out of that era of pop punk music like fall that boy is something I can still listen to and enjoy and really like blink way to I listened to and I go ah some of these songs are good right like all the small things are like there-there hits but like their albums through and through just there's a lot of junk going through that we don't need to go on music no no more ah Jackson writes in and says hi writing back again I'm I have three questions first off which professor is your favorite also which games do you think of the best starters and lastly give me eat your dream team of from Pokemon sun and moon by that i mean your six favourite pokemon but remember it has to be a strategical and your team could actively get you through the main story i hope you guys have a great day thank you for all the work sent from my zune I didn't realize you're gonna get a homework assignment I know I feel like that last question might take a lot of time but I will say my favorite professor is Kakui that's pretty easy and which games has the best starters I'd actually probably say Jen seven I eat like rowlett Lytton and pop Leo plop-plop-plop-plop Leo popular pop Leo I like them all equally and I like every stage of their evolution like generation 5 I liked a pic a lot but I don't like em Bor I don't think emboar is that great i love oshawa i think asha wats super adorable super great but i don't care for samurott so i would say gen7 that last question those very time consuming let me think about it will do your thing I'm still picking ah I think my favorite professor is probably Sycamore just big because I prefer a more mature gentleman I think he's got a little more you know he's got it more together not so foolish and of course he's not married so potentially available for dates and such a favorite starters I'd have to say Jen too because that's where you get your sin de quills and your todo dials and the good stuff yeah but you got an Chikorita dude it ain't nothing wrong with chiquita I mean ain't nothing right with Chikorita either but there ain't nothing rights just like right in that perfect mellow zone of green blob i would i would argue that's chicka rate is fine i would well in a in a contest of all the starter pokemon chikorita is very low on that list chikorita losses hahaha like I don't know what other starter money or starters than Chikorita name one starter worse than Chikorita k fender won the second ok Lytton no wow not now you're raw I was gonna say like that turtle turtle just Oh laughter what it turns into it cuz uh cuz torterra is really cool he's like a bonsai bonsai tree thing twice every I would argue pure junk like I don't want to argue that Treecko is worse than chikorita all right I could see that I okay so anyways gentoo I Travis professor and generation starters professor Sycamore is also my favorite I think he has more personality than the rest of them and he's also cuter then I guess probably gen-6 honestly I think has the best starters you know I just made fun of fennekin but I think in the scheme of things I think Jen's sixes starters feel cohesive like I like John seven starters a lot but they do not look like they like belong together and I feel like Jen's six and actually gen3 do a really good job of having the designs feel like they have a lot of similar elements gen5 as well but i'll just say gen-6 cuz froakie and Trestman are two of my favorites and while i don't really love fennekin it's not that far down in my writings even though I was just trashing him the last question i mean i would i would probably still go with the same team that i had i mean i had criminal I had to canon I had in sinaa roar I had a low and raichu I had a genetic I can't say its name [ __ ] tonic shin addiction otic is fine Shin attic is fine and all right what was my last one I don't remember my last one but oh oh oh uh Palos and there you go yeah i would i would still go with those I I got me through the main story fine i think they were all great like when I go through the main Pokemon story or just any Pokemon game I like to have pokemon that that are either new or just are exciting to me and I knew from the moment I saw sandy gasps and Palace and I like I was like oh I definitely want those dudes I don't care how good or not good or how meta or not meta they are I just want a sand castle on my team and then you had one then everything was right in the world at that point in time what about you guys it's a tough call I mean I definitely want to keep a ribbon because that's super cute i wantcha nautic cuz it's super cute I want I want to do bitter back I don't want to evolve it anymore please and have my little spider with the water bubble on his head I want to sell assets as Ozil hey so am i rosy a lot fun you will it's just and I can't remember what order the words go it's a little like jazz hands I want one of those uh I want what's my it's a good throw back i will give me one of them psychic right shoes lullaby to you as real gray that'd be a good time fun time dude and then probably you can't have volcarona in sun and moon I would need what is my birdie dude called to can anybody now my birdie buddy picolet sling fletchinder and Tala flame hahaha like for the rest of all Pokemon history any team that I build myself if I have like the full menu of options is either gonna have volcarona or talonflame or volcarona and talonflame so since in this option I had the option to have talonflame I don't get me a talonflame all right all right Travis I would give a similar answer to you Steven that my answer is just going to be the team that I had in sun and moon because well I pick the pokemon that I think are cool and want to have on my team so it ends up essentially asking the same question my team was mimicked you rob um be a lowland Persian a lowland raichu pre bominable the situation a dark-type and that's really redundant type coverage but hey those are the pokemon i like all right thanks for reading in last question here is from Don add time to weigh in on an old topic you guys ready for this I'm probably not alright living in Canada we don't have access to red vines as you do in the south but recently I tried some can finally end the debate when comparing red vines to Twizzlers it's no contest Twizzlers win every time red vines don't have the right consistency to be considered licorice but if you classify red vines as a chewy candy they do have a unique texture and an amazing cream soda flavor red vines are an amazing candy but Twizzlers are the ultimate licorice agreed so here's the real kicker I have no recollection of red vines or Twizzlers being relevant to this program at all which just goes to show how long we have been doing this garbage piece of it may have been an immediate segments that Travis was not involved in it no now Travis was here Travis what let's start it now what side are you on licorice is terrible universally the head bad that's all right so I first off red vines are superior no yes second ad in has declared I also like how he considers us the south because the three of us live in northern states and so today like technically them below Macy Dixie yeah yeah we'll doesn't make the cut will definitely makes the cut he's like right next to the White House that's the cut the one hell of the cut is the mason-dixon line we made that for a reason it's a real thing it has has a pretty nasty history associated with it but that is the wreath that is the official thing that separates the north of the United States from the south I just think it's funny because I've never been like referred to as the south but I guess Canada has priority on the North everything south of somewhere that being said I will concede red vines do fall in unconsidered usually the 299 American dollar bag of red vines gets you the most consistency for for your purchasing habits because if the bags are bigger or smaller I feel like sometimes they don't hit peak Red Vine taste the only spent only be a thing this would normally be a type of statement that I would find flabbergasting that you're making because it just seems like very wild claims although I have similar experiences with cheezits I feel like the size of the box of cheez-its you buy like the very large boxes have very bad cheez-its yeah I think it's the same with with soda to like I and and that's it that has to do with how it bottles it right like I think a can of soda tastes way better than a bottle of soda I think there's like more crisps crispness and like the way the carbonation like it it feels more bubbly in a can and I like that a lot uh and so maybe it's how they like bag / package red vines or the cheezits in this case yeah I I feel like there's a certain bag of red vines you have to buy to get the best flavor and so I will admit that red vines can taste bad but that's only in the the way they're packaged and I don't know about that I don't know honestly I don't know that about Twizzlers because i don't buy Twizzlers enough like why would I buy Twizzlers when when when red vines are there but red vines are good the religion you you buy Twizzlers because you want something that you can bite into and like I mean I am obviously the one who's constantly you know stop feeling things with your mouth for people who complain about foods because of the way it has a mouth filled stop don't taste food don't feel it but but red twizzlers you bite and there's a chew and and there's consistency to them that red vines just completely lacking I'm starting to realize why I have no memory of this it's because I just I mean it as as listeners know there's a lot of there a lot of things that will do this to me but just I'm gone you start arguing about which piece of garbage candy tastes butter and I'm just so what's the good candy yeah well I can't refuse candy no I mean candy is just bad i don't like sweets so I'm sort of biased anyway like I don't just generally like candy so if you're arguing about like reeses versus whatever is a competitor to that I would be similarly bored if if you had to buy a candy though if if you walked in and said hey you were you were on uh you were on a date with Professor Sycamore and mm-hmm attention and they said listen I want you to pick out a candy that both of us can enjoy what do you buy event I mean that's the kicker right is because I I know that the typical human being enjoys garbage candy but I I so I probably I mean well actually no professor Sycamore is um a cultured individual so he would probably also enjoy dark chocolate like I do all right I do enjoy a dark choc I'm not gonna argue with a chocolate eighty percent ninety percent what's your what's your pitch the the darker the better generally all right what about white chocolate how I feel about that no the battle that's not even chocolate no I'm react I'll eat a white chocolate but i would i would take out your granite I'll take a a milk chocolate probably over a dark chocolate but i'm not i'm not going to shy away dark chocolate I'll tell you what though there's this chocolate I think it's made by godiva that has cayenne pepper is that that is a pupper yes it has cayenne pepper on the inside and I didn't ever think that spicy chocolate would be a thing I would enjoy but boy spicy chocolate is a thing I enjoy my brother lives in Columbus Ohio and there is there well there's actually a bit of an ice cream rivalry in Columbus Ohio between a place that I believe it's called graders and a place called Jenny's graders is the more traditional ice cream like you you know chocolate vanilla strawberry or your traditional flavors and I think a lot of the purists tend to like graders but then there's another institution called Jenny's which is a much more hipstery and they have a lot of strange flavors stuff like head lavender there once um which uh you know it tasted like lavender smells my mom's favorite at jenny's is an ice cream that's chocolate and cayenne pepper and she adores the stuff and I think you can actually order it online so if you like that Steve I think you should order Jenny's Queen City Cayenne cuz all right it is quite good ice cream I'm gonna look into that cuz yeah I uh I never thought I'd like it but it's really really good well there you go the debate is the debate is the debate let's wrap up this episode Travis give us our pokemon of the week and we'll go from there oh yeah that oh yeah so our pokemon of the week this week is Wigglytuff it was sent in by a listener and Twitter they asked I don't have their twitter handle real quick but i'll get that as travis goes Wigglytuff doesn't get a lot of usage in VGC 2017 but because it's because of its ability competitive which is the same ability that melodic has access to which we mentioned a few weeks ago it isn't completely unusable competitive is very great because of all of the pokemon namely arcanine that have intimidate competitive as we mentioned before will increase your special attack by two stages any time any of your stats are lowered which includes one the pokemon with competitive is subjected to intimidates loss of attack so you get intimidated and then your special attack goes up by two stages I'm going to feature to move sets here the first is from Gabe Brown and its Wigglytuff with assault vest the ability competitive the EV spread is for and HP 188 in defense 236 and special attack 12 and special defense 68 and special defense I don't see justification here for why that EV spread is useful it's actually kind of strange that you would invest that much in defense over HP because I'm very precise though yeah yes I'm sure it's there for very specific reasons like to live a very specific thing that would normally one hit KO it so I'm not sure what we're trying to avoid there but timid nature with Thunderbolt hyper Thunderbolt Thunderbolt hyper voice dazzling gleam and Fire Blast now as we've talked about assault vest before which increases the special defense of a Pokemon but prevents them from using any nondamaging moves that's why V set is an all-out attacking set moveset gives you your to stab types in hyper voice and dazzling gleam to give you the same type attack bonus and then coverage of stuff like cart Anna or um the occasional magnezone with Fire Blast and then Thunderbolt covers flying types and water type stuff like a rack wanted or pelipper um that sort of thing and generally this is less of a specific counter to arcanine as melodic is we talked about how melodic is specifically a counter to arcanine and some other pokemon like guard Trump I'm Wigglytuff because we're not running you know like a water-type move you're basically trying to get the benefit out of the pokemon with intimidate without necessarily being a specific counter to that Pokemon you just want to be able to go in with a boosted special attack and just be generally good um the other alternate here comes to us from I don't really know how to pronounce this user name is it Dame cog a dom Academy comi gamma Chi get yet Kamehameha sends us Wigglytuff with citrus Barry and I mentioned before on an episode that I didn't know why people use Sitrus berry over the berries like I Appa berry and those sorts of things and I realize it's because those ones trigger at a lower HP reservoir then does Sitrus berry so anyway Wigglytuff with Sitrus berry the ability again it's competitive this EV spread is 252 and HP for and special attack and 252 in special defense this is a much more defensive Wigglytuff and this is a calm nature with hyper voice dazzling gleam disabled and wish um disabled in which are interesting choices especially for doubles in disables case because there's a lot less switching when there are only for pokemon that you can bring into a battle so whereas in singles where disabled you don't really end up using because they can just switch out and get rid of the disabled you end up harming your opponent a little more in a doubles scenario with access to disable especially because you can end up disabling important stuff like protect or that sort of thing yeah I mean similar similar thing it's it's you accept it in this case instead of being a little more offensive in this case you're very defensive so you're banking on getting the special attack boost from competitive not so that you're like an offensive powerhouse but so that you have very good bulk and a decent offensive output and the ability to hit multiple multiple opponents with stuff like hyper voice and dazzling gleam wish if you don't know is a move that well after if after two turns heel whatever Pokemon is in that spot a considerable amount so you can sort of use it to recover HP another move people are talking about in slack that's worth considering is the move heal pulse which is a move that as it suggests heals your partner Pokemon and a lot of occasions people use that if the Pokemon partnered with the heal pulse user is like a setup sweeper something's like a snorlax with like curse or belly drum or even trying shenanigans with like speed swap with Farah mosa or something being able to constantly heal the pokemon that's been bulked up by those sorts of stat increases can be pretty devastating if you get it set up and that's you know usually a big if so that's another consideration I think that's enough for Glee tough right yeah there you go Wigglytuff and its evolutionary relatives share the same category name as qwilfish and drifloon they're all known as the balloon Pokemon Wigglytuff has the highest HP of all fairy-type pokémon and in its earlier appearance wigglytuff's white stomach did Alton did not always extend above its map mouth but however it does always in modern appearances it looks like after crystal they change that by going by the sprites here and a shiny wiggly puff is more of a purple than instead of a pink instead of bluish eyes the eyes are more greenish so if ya care about Chinese there you go it's a decent looking shiny really tough is twenty-five percent male 75% female and it is normal fairy one of the pokemon that got their types changed once generation six rolled around was I the only one who was i I know I'm not the only one but where the two of you disappointed when chancy and bliss II didn't get fairy type a little bit yeah I guess I don't really think about it are they just normal yep Quran that's weird yeah I just hadn't really think about it hmm interesting uh by the way that request was sent in by at Boulder snap on Twitter they asked if we could make a competitive move set for Wigglytuff so
