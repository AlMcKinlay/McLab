segments sprinkled throughout that (2:49 - 2:54)
interview for you to watch the ISE break (2:51 - 3:00)

some of the people who are driving now (3:00 - 3:04)
and not passengers in cars yeah help the (3:01 - 3:06)
help ring I've been left right now (3:04 - 3:08)

right ready (3:08 - 3:13)
hey Siri search Kickstarter for Johto (3:09 - 3:17)
legends all right doesn't hate Siri only (3:13 - 3:19)
work if you have your voice was it (3:17 - 3:20)
supposed to work like that (3:19 - 3:25)
oh no no hay series dumb haha Alexa we (3:20 - 3:29)
add Soylent to my wish list wait no no (3:25 - 3:31)
no Alexa search Kickstarter for Johto (3:29 - 3:33)
legends there I've already helped out a (3:31 - 3:34)
whole other group of people who are (3:33 - 3:36)
totally like it I'll help out I has a (3:34 - 3:39)
web browser I don't think they can like (3:36 - 3:42)
the integration okay cuz isn't Alexa (3:39 - 3:44)
just like a tube that talks to you yeah (3:42 - 3:46)
yeah it's like two to two who likes from (3:44 - 3:51)
Kansas tube but I never never asked it (3:46 - 3:52)
to search for something I'm usually like (3:51 - 3:55)
I like so what's the weather or Alexa (3:52 - 3:58)
what's the news or Alexa how Alexa how (3:55 - 3:59)
long will it take for me to get to work (3:58 - 4:02)
it could do that but it knows where you (3:59 - 4:02)
work (4:02 - 4:05)
well yeah you originally tell it you (4:02 - 4:06)
tell it where you work (4:05 - 4:08)
it knows where it is so then it will say (4:06 - 4:10)
like it takes thirty four minutes with (4:08 - 4:12)
current traffic I don't think that would (4:10 - 4:14)
work for me I think it would (4:12 - 4:16)
I don't see why now because uh the name (4:14 - 4:18)
of the place that I work is most (4:16 - 4:20)
commonly associated with a set of (4:18 - 4:22)
buildings it's about a mile away from (4:20 - 4:24)
where I actually work and when you're in (4:22 - 4:27)
the district that's a significant (4:24 - 4:29)
distance I hear the kids call it the D (4:27 - 4:32)
not the district they do not okay (4:29 - 4:34)
they're from the right are gonna call it (4:32 - 4:35)
anything they'll call it the DMV but (4:34 - 4:39)
they do not call it the D nobody no no (4:35 - 4:41)
you can tell if somebody you can tell us (4:39 - 4:44)
somebody's actually from DC is if they (4:41 - 4:47)
say DC or if they say the district if (4:44 - 4:48)
somebody says I'm from Washington DC (4:47 - 4:51)
then you know they're not okay all right (4:48 - 4:54)
good to know we got we allowed to talk (4:51 - 4:55)
about today we got some Pokemon news (4:54 - 4:59)
some regarding Pokemon go the new (4:55 - 5:03)
movie magic carp of course and that'll (4:59 - 5:05)
probably be what we spend a lot of time (5:03 - 5:07)
on is Magikarp jump then we have the (5:05 - 5:10)
interview with Braxton very Pokemon (5:07 - 5:13)
focused he also gives us some behind the (5:10 - 5:15)
scenes of Pokemon symphonic evolutions (5:13 - 5:18)
which was the official Pokemon music (5:15 - 5:21)
tour that happened and so he has some (5:18 - 5:25)
insight on that and then after that (5:21 - 5:27)
that's a very Pokemon heavy interview so (5:25 - 5:29)
really really great one Braxton's are (5:27 - 5:31)
really great dude then after that we (5:29 - 5:34)
have some emails which one email might (5:31 - 5:37)
spark the anime debate again I know that (5:34 - 5:38)
was a hot topic and slacked this past (5:37 - 5:41)
week and then we have our Pokemon of the (5:38 - 5:42)
week so that's our show for you guys (5:41 - 5:44)
today we can just dive right into (5:42 - 5:47)
Pokemon news first bit of news being (5:44 - 5:50)
Pokemon the movie I choose you to debate (5:47 - 5:54)
to debate to debut in Paris on July 6 (5:50 - 5:57)
Pokemon the movie I choose you will (5:54 - 6:01)
debut at the Japan Expo in Paris on July (5:57 - 6:04)
6 the movie will not air in Japan until (6:01 - 6:09)
July 15th the movie's director Japanese (6:04 - 6:11)
name that I would butcher and Ash's (6:09 - 6:16)
Japanese voice actor Rika masu Tomo it's (6:11 - 6:18)
a little bit easier than that first name (6:16 - 6:21)
will be at the event the announcement (6:18 - 6:23)
also states that Pikachu will be present (6:21 - 6:26)
presumably referring to an entertainer (6:23 - 6:29)
in a Pikachu costume the airing will use (6:26 - 6:31)
Japanese audio but include French (6:29 - 6:34)
subtitles that news is off Bulbul pedia (6:31 - 6:37)
Pikachu will be present a I think this (6:34 - 6:41)
is the first movie that is not debuting (6:37 - 6:44)
in Japan I think you're right but I (6:41 - 6:46)
don't know for certain I'll be curious (6:44 - 6:49)
how good that movie is compared to past (6:46 - 6:51)
movies because this is the first movie (6:49 - 6:53)
that has I don't know source material (6:51 - 6:55)
it's based off of something that's (6:53 - 6:59)
already existed it is but it I mean it (6:55 - 7:01)
just generally the the trailers have (6:59 - 7:03)
looked like it's going to be better but (7:01 - 7:04)
it's probably just gonna be the same (7:03 - 7:07)
formula as usual right at least be (7:04 - 7:10)
everybody goes into a panic dark-eyed (7:07 - 7:12)
shows machine goes wild somebody turns (7:10 - 7:13)
into a licking ton (7:12 - 7:16)
lick lick eat Ungh looky look no they (7:13 - 7:17)
don't turn into a lick a tongue they (7:16 - 7:18)
turn into a lickilicky (7:17 - 7:20)
don't isn't it a shiny like a lucky - (7:18 - 7:25)
this isn't a yellow not is this ah I (7:20 - 7:27)
might be making that up maybe it's just (7:25 - 7:28)
cuz I really like shiny lickilicky it's (7:27 - 7:30)

so tourists will have a lot of photo (9:41 - 9:46)
opportunities during this time what an (9:43 - 9:47)
event (9:46 - 9:49)
yeah I'm very confused about what (9:47 - 9:51)
Pikachu's have to do with splashing (9:49 - 9:53)
other than the little Pikachu who sits (9:51 - 9:56)
by my pool and Magikarp jump but how (9:53 - 9:57)
many males do you think we're gonna get (9:56 - 9:59)
where people are gonna say it's supposed (9:57 - 10:01)
to be Pikachu not Pikachu's because the (9:59 - 10:04)
plural of Pikachu is Pikachu probably (10:01 - 10:06)
like two okay I was just wondering what (10:04 - 10:07)
the over-and-under was on that (10:06 - 10:10)
let me recheck the article I mean I (10:07 - 10:12)
Betty I bet the Arctic (10:10 - 10:14)
I bet the article adds an S that's not (10:12 - 10:16)
I'm not seeing any asses in the article (10:14 - 10:17)
I probably got carried away (10:16 - 10:20)
my Japanese tongue was taking over and (10:17 - 10:22)
mixing and matching there's only there's (10:20 - 10:26)
like there's only two photos in this (10:22 - 10:28)
article one photo is what looks to be a (10:26 - 10:31)
parade like the Macy's Day Parade just (10:28 - 10:33)
with nothing but Pikachu's mean Macy's (10:31 - 10:36)
Thanksgiving Day Parade yes yes yes (10:33 - 10:38)

holiday yeah it's where we all eat (10:43 - 10:51)
designer shirts the second photo is 20 (10:45 - 10:53)
or so Pikachu in a boat I don't know (10:51 - 10:54)
who's operating this boat I don't know (10:53 - 10:56)
if any of these peaches have license a (10:54 - 10:59)
water license but they fit a lot of them (10:56 - 11:01)
in a boat the boating license test was (10:59 - 11:03)
like the only test I ever failed in (11:01 - 11:06)
grade school I mean I failed other tests (11:03 - 11:08)
but that was like the only important (11:06 - 11:10)
test I ever failed I was really sad (11:08 - 11:11)
because everybody else got their boating (11:10 - 11:13)
license and I didn't I don't know if (11:11 - 11:16)
that's a true story or not oh it's true (11:13 - 11:18)
why wouldn't it be true (11:16 - 11:22)
I don't know mmm boating big in Michigan (11:18 - 11:25)
and there's a lot of water and not a lot (11:22 - 11:28)
else yeah you guys got the good side we (11:25 - 11:29)
got the we got the polluted side over (11:28 - 11:30)
here in Milwaukee (11:29 - 11:32)
yeah Lake Michigan on this end is pretty (11:30 - 11:34)
beautiful friend of the show Allegra (11:32 - 11:38)
Frank she never seems to disappoint here (11:34 - 11:40)
with Pokemon news articles if there's (11:38 - 11:41)
one thing we can (11:40 - 11:43)
count on from Allegra she pumps out (11:41 - 11:46)
pokemon news like no one else she has (11:43 - 11:49)
the deep cut here titled the Pokemon (11:46 - 11:51)
anime just aired its most ridiculous (11:49 - 11:53)
episode yet (11:51 - 11:55)
baseball brings out the best and worst (11:53 - 11:58)
in all of us there have been plenty of (11:55 - 11:59)
silly Pokemon episodes throughout the (11:58 - 12:01)
years but Pokemon Sun and Moon latest (11:59 - 12:04)
may be the best of them all the series (12:01 - 12:06)
28th episode aired in Japan earlier (12:04 - 12:08)
today and Twitter is having a field day (12:06 - 12:11)
over how weird it is so just a spoiler (12:08 - 12:14)
if if you're you know if you want that (12:11 - 12:16)
deep animail or not so yeah you don't (12:14 - 12:17)
want you don't want the twist ending (12:16 - 12:21)
spoiled okay the basic plot of the (12:17 - 12:23)
episode according to fansite Pokemon (12:21 - 12:26)
master goes recap is that Ash's Pokemon (12:23 - 12:28)
School in the Aloha region is visited by (12:26 - 12:32)
a baseball master naturally this leads (12:28 - 12:34)
to some extremely intense Pokemon (12:32 - 12:36)
infused ball games Pokemon Sun and moons (12:34 - 12:39)
new animation style has been polarizing (12:36 - 12:41)
with longtime fans for the Pokemon anime (12:39 - 12:43)
franchise and the reasons for that are (12:41 - 12:45)
displayed throughout this episode (12:43 - 12:48)
episode 28 is no has no interest in (12:45 - 12:50)
playing it straight as a parody of one (12:48 - 12:51)
of Japan's biggest sports this (12:50 - 12:54)
installment installments modus operandi (12:51 - 12:57)
that's probably something I die I notice (12:54 - 12:59)
operon die there have you heard people (12:57 - 13:02)
say like oh that's my mo that's what I (12:59 - 13:05)
stands for I never knew that and I like (13:02 - 13:08)
a bird mo but I didn't know right good (13:05 - 13:12)
for that seems to be go big or go home (13:08 - 13:15)
the scene goes straight up Dragon Ball Z (13:12 - 13:18)
with how into the game ash and kiwami (13:15 - 13:21)
one of the olala trial and trials get (13:18 - 13:24)
that's one thing I will say about these (13:21 - 13:26)
Sun and Moon anime is they are not (13:24 - 13:29)
afraid to put a lot of facial animations (13:26 - 13:31)
and face summations as we call them in (13:29 - 13:34)
the bits got it yes there's a bunch of (13:31 - 13:37)
screenshots here from it and then the (13:34 - 13:39)
article here closes personally we are (13:37 - 13:41)
also big fans of Sun and moons jokey (13:39 - 13:44)
tone this beta this baseball episode is (13:41 - 13:47)
the is what makes everything so fun it (13:44 - 13:48)
doesn't take itself too seriously (13:47 - 13:50)
Pokemon is fun the anime isn't in the (13:48 - 13:52)
wrong for reminding us of that (13:50 - 13:54)
definitely knows how to get serious when (13:52 - 13:55)
it needs (13:54 - 13:58)
and the theme song the English theme (13:55 - 14:00)
song is growing at me I hated it at (13:58 - 14:03)
first the Japanese one is as I loved (14:00 - 14:05)
from the start and it continues to be (14:03 - 14:08)
really great and the ending song is so (14:05 - 14:11)
adorable I can't say one way or the (14:08 - 14:13)
other the black and white has pretty (14:11 - 14:15)
good theme song yeah (14:13 - 14:19)
also bad I can't a yell Pikachu not (14:15 - 14:22)
giving Patrat a high five really good I (14:19 - 14:26)
never even noticed that in the for those (14:22 - 14:28)
who want to go back and watch the (14:26 - 14:30)
pokemon black and white anime in the (14:28 - 14:33)
theme song which is pretty enjoyable you (14:30 - 14:34)

you don't just watch the whole yeah you (14:34 - 14:37)
don't have to you don't have to suffer (14:36 - 14:39)

whole bunch of basic black and white (14:39 - 14:44)
Pokemon like Pat rat and whatever else (14:41 - 14:45)

doubt in my mind that's like that's like (15:03 - 15:10)
in real life when you're going for a (15:08 - 15:12)
high five and the other person doesn't (15:10 - 15:14)

always know what's right (15:31 - 15:37)
screw the heart Pikachu is busy alright (15:32 - 15:39)
you talk about the new main series (15:37 - 15:42)
Pokemon game that just came out Magikarp (15:39 - 15:44)
trump no not yet not yet we got we got (15:42 - 15:46)
to talk about last year's Pokemon game (15:44 - 15:49)
Pokemon go Allegra Frank blessing us (15:46 - 15:51)
with two articles this week Pokemon goes (15:49 - 15:55)
anti-cheating update hides rare finds (15:51 - 15:57)
from view Cyril has been updated since (15:55 - 16:00)
it's been originally published but I (15:57 - 16:01)
want to bring this up because this (16:00 - 16:03)
addresses the the cheating in Pokemon go (16:01 - 16:05)
several Pokemon players are reporting (16:03 - 16:07)
they can no longer find anything but the (16:05 - 16:08)
most common monsters (16:07 - 16:11)
in their game the reason the antic has (16:08 - 16:13)
flagged accounts that use unofficial (16:11 - 16:15)
trackers or other software resulting in (16:13 - 16:18)
a widespread shadow ban that's the term (16:15 - 16:20)
that several Pokemon NGO communities are (16:18 - 16:23)
using for the action Yantic appears to (16:20 - 16:25)
have taken to curb cheaters for the (16:23 - 16:28)
mobile game a player doesn't know that (16:25 - 16:30)
they've been flagged by the developer as (16:28 - 16:32)
they are still able to play the game and (16:30 - 16:34)
find Geodude Pidgey Ekans or other (16:32 - 16:36)
common pokemon let me stop you right now (16:34 - 16:39)
Allegra Atkins is not common I've seen (16:36 - 16:42)
like one but I'm Garrett's read I'm sure (16:39 - 16:43)
there's a there regional differences (16:42 - 16:47)
like apparently if you live in like like (16:43 - 16:50)
the west side of the us like Sandshrew (16:47 - 16:52)
is like the most common thing you will (16:50 - 16:54)
ever find and that's just not the case (16:52 - 16:56)
here up in the chilly Midwest (16:54 - 16:58)
yeah I'm sure like New Mexico Ekans or (16:56 - 17:01)
Arizona Ekans are everywhere that'd be (16:58 - 17:03)
my guess at least but more uncommon (17:01 - 17:06)
Pokemon finds no longer show up in the (17:03 - 17:07)
in-game tracker (17:06 - 17:08)
according to players who admit from (17:07 - 17:11)
using BOTS or third-party tools in the (17:08 - 17:13)
past nyet ik has outright banned Pokemon (17:11 - 17:14)
go players who relied on outside (17:13 - 17:16)
trackers while playing the game the (17:14 - 17:19)
difference this time around is that it (17:16 - 17:21)
appears to be evidence of new automated (17:19 - 17:24)
banning systems quote it is our opinion (17:21 - 17:26)
that we may be witnessing the beginning (17:24 - 17:28)
of a machine learning approach to bot (17:26 - 17:31)
detection wrote eight wrote a user from (17:28 - 17:34)
the Silk Road subreddit quote if the (17:31 - 17:36)
parameters for a shadow ban are (17:34 - 17:38)
consistently adjusted server size as (17:36 - 17:41)
they can now easily be then the antics (17:38 - 17:42)
machine learning engineers can train (17:41 - 17:45)
their their detection algorithms in ever (17:42 - 17:48)
approving ever more aggressive ways and (17:45 - 17:51)
bottlers will consistently sorry (17:48 - 17:54)
bottlers those people recycling and both (17:51 - 17:57)

to reevaluate what factors may be (17:57 - 18:02)
triggering the detection bahding not (17:59 - 18:04)
bottling and independent trackers have (18:02 - 18:06)
been long have been a long polarizing (18:04 - 18:08)
subject with pokemon go players while (18:06 - 18:11)
bots use to poach rare pokemon level up (18:08 - 18:13)
quickly and campout gems are typically (18:11 - 18:16)
revealed there are some who find them (18:13 - 18:18)
essential to getting the enjoyment out (18:16 - 18:18)
of the game (18:18 - 18:20)
afternoon antic disabled the own games (18:18 - 18:22)
tracker last summer third-party (18:20 - 18:24)
mapping services cropped up and many (18:22 - 18:26)
players rely on them to find a more (18:24 - 18:28)
Pokemon the developer has cracked down (18:26 - 18:30)
on these tools however furthering (18:28 - 18:33)
angering further angering fans there's (18:30 - 18:35)
some more to the article but I just want (18:33 - 18:36)
to read the update here update knee (18:35 - 18:38)
antic didn't confirm that this method is (18:36 - 18:40)
currently in effect but the company has (18:38 - 18:42)
told polygon in a statement that it is (18:40 - 18:44)
consistently working on anti cheat (18:42 - 18:47)
measures quote knee antic is committed (18:44 - 18:49)
to maintaining the state of Pokemon go (18:47 - 18:50)
and our community of trainers a (18:49 - 18:52)
representative said quote people who (18:50 - 18:55)
violate the Pokemon go terms the service (18:52 - 18:57)
including by using third-party software (18:55 - 18:58)
or the other cheats may have their (18:57 - 19:00)
gameplay affected and may not be able to (18:58 - 19:03)
see all the Pokemon around them while we (19:00 - 19:04)
cannot discuss the systems implemented (19:03 - 19:07)
we can confirm there are consistently (19:04 - 19:09)
that we are consistently refining new (19:07 - 19:10)
ways to ensure the integrity of the (19:09 - 19:13)
games in order to keep it fun and fair (19:10 - 19:16)
for all players end quote so I don't (19:13 - 19:18)
know if you both are playing Pokemon go (19:16 - 19:22)
I've played so much go in the last two (19:18 - 19:24)
weeks because of adventure week and (19:22 - 19:27)
because your watch works now because a (19:24 - 19:28)
my watch works which is just incredible (19:27 - 19:31)
it's so great to mow the lawn and turn (19:28 - 19:33)
on the watch and get the steps and hatch (19:31 - 19:35)
the eggs ah it's fantastic I love it so (19:33 - 19:39)
much but I I've always been on the (19:35 - 19:42)
stance of liking games that have (19:39 - 19:45)
server-side restrictions obviously there (19:42 - 19:48)
will always be somebody who gets through (19:45 - 19:50)
and that has to be adjusted that has to (19:48 - 19:51)
be fixed I've talked about in the past (19:50 - 19:54)
where games like overwatch or Diablo 3 (19:51 - 19:57)
or World of Warcraft destiny Final (19:54 - 19:59)
Fantasy 14 these are all games that rely (19:57 - 20:02)
on servers that makes it very hard to (19:59 - 20:04)
cheat I've been told that people have (20:02 - 20:07)
cheated in overwatch and and Blizzard is (20:04 - 20:08)
really good on getting rid of those (20:07 - 20:10)
cheaters removing from the game banning (20:08 - 20:13)
them patching that fixing of course this (20:10 - 20:14)
applies for Pokemon go since that stuff (20:13 - 20:16)
is server base as well (20:14 - 20:19)
no one's orangey or software setting for (20:16 - 20:21)
Pokemon Pokemon go (20:19 - 20:24)
no one's encountering a Charizard not (20:21 - 20:26)
being able to catch it powering off (20:24 - 20:28)
their iPhone turning it back on to try (20:26 - 20:31)
to recap that Charizard again I think (20:28 - 20:33)
that's why I like Pokemon go so much is (20:31 - 20:36)
it feels like there is that that (20:33 - 20:37)
opportunity for something to get away (20:36 - 20:41)
from you like a Skarmory that I saw and (20:37 - 20:43)
through a Pokeball and then it ran away (20:41 - 20:46)
and I was legit upset because that's the (20:43 - 20:47)
only Skarmory I've ever seen (20:46 - 20:49)
the only scrubber you've ever seen in (20:47 - 20:51)
your entire life in my entire life (20:49 - 20:53)
but I've been I've been told Pikachu (20:51 - 20:55)
in-person will be at the Paris event (20:53 - 20:59)
yeah true so it my curate correctly the (20:55 - 21:01)
direction so it when they say (20:59 - 21:02)
third-party tracking software they're (21:01 - 21:06)
talking about like those websites that I (21:02 - 21:09)
access like I guess some sort of API and (21:06 - 21:11)
then show where all of the Pokemon in (21:09 - 21:12)
your vicinity are like they're not (21:11 - 21:15)
talking about like for example the Silk (21:12 - 21:19)
Roads Nest Almanac or whatever they call (21:15 - 21:21)
it are they no no they're not talking (21:19 - 21:24)
about nest charts because that's just a (21:21 - 21:26)
website you go to people report that you (21:24 - 21:29)
know squirrel or spawning here maybe in (21:26 - 21:32)
two weeks that nest changes - Geodude (21:29 - 21:34)
yeah they're not talking about that I (21:32 - 21:36)
would because if if that were the case (21:34 - 21:38)
and they were banning people just for (21:36 - 21:40)
like going to a lot of nests that would (21:38 - 21:44)
seem ludicrous to me but it I yeah I I (21:40 - 21:47)
mean it's like sure I get the argument (21:44 - 21:52)
that the game was it was it was easier (21:47 - 21:54)
to find specific Pokemon when the game (21:52 - 21:56)
had stronger tracking functionality and (21:54 - 22:00)
I get that third-party websites and (21:56 - 22:02)
things like that make it can sort of (22:00 - 22:05)
replace that old tracking system but to (22:02 - 22:07)
me it's like you're using a third-party (22:05 - 22:11)
thing that makes it way easier for you (22:07 - 22:13)
than other people I get it and botting (22:11 - 22:17)
like gosh of course that would warrant (22:13 - 22:21)
some sort of action as an iphone user (22:17 - 22:23)
and also somebody who doesn't jailbreak (22:21 - 22:26)
or modify software I can't really speak (22:23 - 22:30)
to this as as well as people on Silk (22:26 - 22:32)
Road or people that are actually botting (22:30 - 22:35)
or trying to buy it trying to pop but (22:32 - 22:38)
for my understanding which is very which (22:35 - 22:40)
is not a lot a lot of this is on the (22:38 - 22:43)
Android side side of routing and (22:40 - 22:47)
installing extensions or however the (22:43 - 22:48)
extension is probably the wrong word but (22:47 - 22:50)
installing something too (22:48 - 22:53)
you modify and help the software just (22:50 - 22:57)
like how Android has most people who put (22:53 - 23:00)
Pokemon go on YouTube are on Android (22:57 - 23:02)
phones because Android has that built in (23:00 - 23:04)
that the Android has those apps that can (23:02 - 23:05)
record your screen as you play and (23:04 - 23:09)
record everything in and whatnot so yeah (23:05 - 23:10)
I was I was going to say I don't think (23:09 - 23:12)
this is a problem for iPhone users at (23:10 - 23:14)
all because I don't think there's unless (23:12 - 23:16)
you you do route your iPhone which (23:14 - 23:19)
depite are people even able to route (23:16 - 23:21)
iPhones anymore is have a silly thing (23:19 - 23:23)
yeah yeah the the I think there's a (23:21 - 23:25)
jailbreak for ten point oh I don't think (23:23 - 23:27)
for the latest version of ten point O (23:25 - 23:28)
which is ten point three point two I (23:27 - 23:30)
think by edit that just came out I think (23:28 - 23:32)
if you're if you're before if you don't (23:30 - 23:34)
upgrade near before ten point three I (23:32 - 23:36)
think there is a jailbreak for it but (23:34 - 23:38)
yeah I mean Android it's much easier to (23:36 - 23:40)
do this kind of thing on Android than it (23:38 - 23:45)
is in the iPhone iOS environment so the (23:40 - 23:46)
majority of the people who are going to (23:45 - 23:48)
be taking advantage of these hacks are (23:46 - 23:51)
going to be Android users and here's the (23:48 - 23:55)
thing if cheating in some way helps you (23:51 - 23:57)
enjoy the game more and I think we've (23:55 - 24:01)
all been there I I think that I think as (23:57 - 24:06)
as a kid or a teen or or maybe somebody (24:01 - 24:09)
now that I owned a game genie you you (24:06 - 24:11)
better believe people put in cheat codes (24:09 - 24:14)
for you know a hundred lives or to skip (24:11 - 24:17)
levels big head mode we've all there is (24:14 - 24:20)
fun to that the problem with something (24:17 - 24:24)
like Pokemon go or even stuff like world (24:20 - 24:26)
Warcraft or overwatch is you have people (24:24 - 24:30)
paying real money consistently so if I'm (24:26 - 24:30)
paying (24:30 - 24:32)
and I'm not saying cheaters you're doing (24:30 - 24:34)
this this is just an example but if I'm (24:32 - 24:37)
paying six dollars to get three egg (24:34 - 24:38)
incubators which I might have done this (24:37 - 24:40)
past week because I'm so addicted to (24:38 - 24:41)
hatching eggs now I'm getting I'm (24:40 - 24:43)
getting those steps in and somebody else (24:41 - 24:45)
modifies their software to get unlimited (24:43 - 24:48)
egg incubators sure that might be fun (24:45 - 24:50)
for them but they're kind of like (24:48 - 24:52)
ruining it for the rest of us now you (24:50 - 24:54)
could say like well no their game (24:52 - 24:56)
doesn't really affect anyone else but as (24:54 - 24:59)
Pokemon go grows in the edge and they (24:56 - 25:01)
add training trading which is you know (24:59 - 25:02)
they said they're supposed to do this (25:01 - 25:03)
year and they (25:02 - 25:05)
and legendary Pokemon which are supposed (25:03 - 25:08)
to come this year it also affects how (25:05 - 25:11)
gyms operate too because if one person (25:08 - 25:14)
is using a bot and the other isn't that (25:11 - 25:15)
person with a bot is a distinct (25:14 - 25:18)
advantage on right maintaining that gym (25:15 - 25:20)
so I mean you don't even have to talk (25:18 - 25:23)
about features coming in the future to (25:20 - 25:24)
talk about ways in which this affects (25:23 - 25:27)
the player base as a whole yeah online (25:24 - 25:30)
games like this have an ecosystem it's (25:27 - 25:32)
hard for me not to not to have empathy (25:30 - 25:36)
for these people of like you cheated you (25:32 - 25:39)
didn't agree to the terms and services (25:36 - 25:42)
you originally agreed to and Sony antic (25:39 - 25:44)
has every right to remove you from that (25:42 - 25:47)
ecosystem but you you violated the terms (25:44 - 25:50)
of sir yes is what you did get the legal (25:47 - 25:54)
jargon in here overall though I'm still (25:50 - 25:56)
having a great time with Pokemon go I've (25:54 - 25:59)
haven't missed a one of the two streaks (25:56 - 26:02)
in the last two weeks or so hatching (25:59 - 26:04)
eggs I'm thinking about going to the (26:02 - 26:05)
mall later today and like power walk in (26:04 - 26:07)
the mall and hitting the five polka dots (26:05 - 26:11)
in the mall it while hatching eggs man (26:07 - 26:15)
one goes really good huh like I am more (26:11 - 26:19)
compelled to finish my pokedex in (26:15 - 26:22)
Pokemon go than I have been in any main (26:19 - 26:26)
series game wow yeah interesting good (26:22 - 26:28)
idea I've been working on my living (26:26 - 26:30)
decks lately and Wow yeah and I don't (26:28 - 26:33)
know I don't know why that is like I (26:30 - 26:36)
cannot explain that feeling but like (26:33 - 26:39)
when I'm at work I'm fall I'm far enough (26:36 - 26:41)
from a park where I can't hit any of the (26:39 - 26:44)
Pogo stops or see most of them but I'm (26:41 - 26:45)
on the I'm on the edge so I can see like (26:44 - 26:48)
three of the six polka stops in the park (26:45 - 26:50)
and so I consistently check that once an (26:48 - 26:53)
hour at work to be like is there (26:50 - 26:54)
something over there I don't have is (26:53 - 26:56)
there something over there I don't have (26:54 - 26:58)
and then when I go to lunch I take the (26:56 - 26:59)
long way to lunch because there's also (26:58 - 27:02)
two other parks and so like every day (26:59 - 27:04)
when I'm going to get lunch I was like (27:02 - 27:05)
okay we'll stop at this park I'm just (27:04 - 27:06)
going to park in the parking lot pull up (27:05 - 27:08)
Pokemon go ok nothing really here I'll (27:06 - 27:09)
just hit the stop and I'll keep going (27:08 - 27:12)
but I like (27:09 - 27:14)
okay here's a good example so across the (27:12 - 27:16)
street from me at work as a post office (27:14 - 27:19)
so I over this past week I mailed a (27:16 - 27:20)
bunch of the stickers and buttons for (27:19 - 27:22)
all the patreon backers who signed up (27:20 - 27:24)
for that so thank you so much to our (27:22 - 27:26)
patreon backers finally got those mailed (27:24 - 27:29)
out this week I said before June before (27:26 - 27:31)
June so I at least hit that deadline so (27:29 - 27:32)
I was mailing one or two more I had (27:31 - 27:34)
international so I can only mail (27:32 - 27:35)
international mail during the day I (27:34 - 27:37)
can't mail it at night so I walked over (27:35 - 27:39)
to the post office had my Pokemon watch (27:37 - 27:41)
I had my Pokemon go on my watch I headed (27:39 - 27:44)
up post offices also polka stop so (27:41 - 27:45)
that's my polka stop for the day (27:44 - 27:48)
hit the poke stop catch my Pokemon mail (27:45 - 27:50)
mail the last couple letters check (27:48 - 27:52)
Pokemon go and I was like oh man there's (27:50 - 27:55)
a dratini that is about a half mile away (27:52 - 27:58)
I can see it and I was like well I can (27:55 - 28:00)
walk a half mile like that's not a big (27:58 - 28:02)
deal and so I walked that to get the (28:00 - 28:04)
dirty knee which I've already had but I (28:02 - 28:05)
want to get dragon there so I need more (28:04 - 28:07)
dirty knee so I get there (28:05 - 28:09)
catch the dratini look at the polka (28:07 - 28:12)
stops and then I see it a Stantler which (28:09 - 28:13)
is another half mile away (28:12 - 28:17)
hahaha this is all opposite of my work (28:13 - 28:20)
and I go I don't have that I'll just (28:17 - 28:21)
walk it I'll just walk it so I'm walking (28:20 - 28:24)
to get the Stantler and I get there and (28:21 - 28:26)
then I check again and I was like uh hop (28:24 - 28:28)
it I don't have enough hop it to get (28:26 - 28:30)
skip loom yet I can walk that I can walk (28:28 - 28:33)
that so now like 30 minutes later I'm (28:30 - 28:36)
over a mile away from work have you ever (28:33 - 28:39)
heard Zeno's paradox of SBJ in the (28:36 - 28:42)
Stantler it's a really good joke and (28:39 - 28:43)
maybe like four of our listeners are (28:42 - 28:46)
enjoying it yeah yeah I would hope I (28:43 - 28:48)
don't know what it is about Pokemon go (28:46 - 28:51)
that like I want it's so much harder to (28:48 - 28:53)
complete a pokedex in Pokemon go than it (28:51 - 28:55)
is in the main series game but I'm just (28:53 - 28:58)
so compelled to do it and maybe it's (28:55 - 29:00)
just maybe it's just like adventure week (28:58 - 29:03)
and seeing all these new Pokemon like I (29:00 - 29:05)
got a golem I got it I got a Kabutops I (29:03 - 29:10)
got an omastar I got a mega cargo I can (29:05 - 29:12)
whatever that dumb fire slugs name is (29:10 - 29:17)
mad cargo its magcargo I got Meg cargo (29:12 - 29:21)
shorts like I got so many Pokemon I (29:17 - 29:23)
didn't have before and I I don't know (29:21 - 29:24)
why that feels different than a main (29:23 - 29:26)
series game I don't know (29:24 - 29:29)
I will dive into that deeper next week (29:26 - 30:00)
on it's supernatural equations got (29:29 - 30:02)
started some some thoughts on Sun and (30:00 - 30:04)

but I want to I want to get a little a (32:08 - 32:12)
little more information about you before (32:10 - 32:15)
we talk about this cool project you're (32:12 - 32:17)
doing but yeah let's just talk about (32:15 - 32:19)
your history with Pokemon to begin with (32:17 - 32:22)
it seems you know I've been following (32:19 - 32:25)
you on Twitter for I don't know four or (32:22 - 32:28)
five years at this point and to me you (32:25 - 32:31)
it's me you've always seemed like a (32:28 - 32:32)
hardcore Pokemon fan (32:31 - 32:35)
most of the Secchia most the stuff you (32:32 - 32:38)
do is music related but where where did (32:35 - 32:41)
that love of Pokemon stem from I (32:38 - 32:44)
so yeah I've first of all thank you for (32:41 - 32:47)
for being such a fan for a long time (32:44 - 32:51)
I've been doing Pokemon arrangements for (32:47 - 32:53)
yeah probably about four or five years (32:51 - 32:57)
and my love for pokémon and doing (32:53 - 32:59)
arrangements from the series kind of (32:57 - 33:02)
stem from my love of well the first time (32:59 - 33:04)
I ever picked up a bokken Pokemon game (33:02 - 33:10)
which was I think in 2001 or 2002 um I (33:04 - 33:13)
was I had just like moved to a new town (33:10 - 33:16)
and I knew literally no one (33:13 - 33:18)
and my mom was like go make friends (33:16 - 33:22)
you're bugging me get out the house so I (33:18 - 33:25)
I went to the bus stop and she (33:22 - 33:27)
encouraged me to talk to some of the (33:25 - 33:29)
kids there that were my age and I met (33:27 - 33:31)
one kid who was super into Pokemon and (33:29 - 33:36)
was trying to show me a gold gold (33:31 - 33:39)
version and I I told him like I don't oh (33:36 - 33:41)
I don't have a game I can't trade with (33:39 - 33:43)
you or anything and so then after school (33:41 - 33:46)
he invited me over to his house and (33:43 - 33:49)
literally just gave me a gameboy color (33:46 - 33:53)
and a copy of bullets yeah this kid was (33:49 - 33:56)
I mean he had like three gameboy colors (33:53 - 33:59)
he had all three versions you know gold (33:56 - 34:02)
silver and crystal so but yeah I was (33:59 - 34:05)
just totally dumbfounded by his his (34:02 - 34:07)
generosity and then after that I was I (34:05 - 34:09)
was pretty much hooked I would play (34:07 - 34:12)
pokemon every single day after school (34:09 - 34:16)
during school I mean I would say that's (34:12 - 34:18)
that's kind of like a common theme with (34:16 - 34:21)
Pokemon players they just want other (34:18 - 34:22)
people to experience what they're (34:21 - 34:26)
experiencing yeah and then there's the (34:22 - 34:29)
whole fostering friendships aspects of (34:26 - 34:31)
Pokemon both in game and out of game (34:29 - 34:34)
like you have to literally talk to other (34:31 - 34:36)
people in the old the older generations (34:34 - 34:38)
yak came back in my day you had to go (34:36 - 34:40)
out and you had to find a friend with a (34:38 - 34:45)
trading cable in yeah all that yeah but (34:41 - 34:48)
I still play Pokemon to this day so (34:45 - 34:53)
yeah it's not like I'm like oh these (34:48 - 34:56)
youngsters with their newfangled Wi-Fi (34:53 - 35:00)
yeah yeah speaking of Pokemon today have (34:56 - 35:03)
you played Sun our Sun and Moon yeah I (35:00 - 35:07)
have moon and I granted I haven't (35:03 - 35:09)
touched it in a while because I've been (35:07 - 35:12)
so busy working on this album but I (35:09 - 35:15)
really really enjoyed playing through (35:12 - 35:21)
the Lola region it's just so fun I the (35:15 - 35:23)
story the characters are so likable I (35:21 - 35:26)
love how for example yeah and his and (35:23 - 35:29)
his love for malasadas he is a man after (35:26 - 35:33)
my own heart for I mean I always asked (35:29 - 35:36)
people this like what was your favorite (35:33 - 35:37)
thing that Sun and Moon did what was (35:36 - 35:39)
your least favorite thing that Sun and (35:37 - 35:43)
Moon did that is a tough question um I'd (35:39 - 35:45)
say my favorite thing that Sun and Moon (35:43 - 35:48)
did was environmental storytelling which (35:45 - 35:51)
was something I you you only saw a (35:48 - 35:54)
little bit in previous gens maybe like (35:51 - 35:57)
black and white but like for example in (35:54 - 35:59)
the beginning near the beginning of the (35:57 - 36:01)
game and Sun and Moon you go into this (35:59 - 36:04)
person's house on a route it's one of (36:01 - 36:07)
the first ones and there's it's like (36:04 - 36:08)
home to this father who is really (36:07 - 36:14)
dejected and sad about his son who has (36:08 - 36:18)
left home and it seems like they have a (36:14 - 36:21)
fractured relationship and you can find (36:18 - 36:26)
remnants of his sons his son like living (36:21 - 36:28)
in the house and he's kind of like in (36:26 - 36:31)
shrines there but it seems like they (36:28 - 36:33)
they haven't spoken to each other in a (36:31 - 36:35)
long time and that to me was just like (36:33 - 36:38)
super real it like whoa Pokemon has (36:35 - 36:41)
complex characters in this world even if (36:38 - 36:44)
they're not you know at the for a (36:41 - 36:46)
they're not Anna the main cast or (36:44 - 36:48)
anything so I just like those little (36:46 - 36:51)
bits of immersiveness professor Kukui (36:48 - 36:54)
slab I just love that he has like a gym (36:51 - 36:58)
in the basement his lab so cool (36:54 - 37:01)
um so yeah definitely environment design (36:58 - 37:04)
um something I didn't like about sunny (37:01 - 37:10)
moon I had sort of wished the story was (37:04 - 37:14)
a little stronger I I loved all of the (37:10 - 37:18)
characters um but I think just by the (37:14 - 37:20)
end of it I was looking for something (37:18 - 37:24)
more uh I can't really like put it into (37:20 - 37:27)
words but yeah it wasn't bad (37:24 - 37:30)
no and I think we said that in the past (37:27 - 37:32)
that we liked the story it wasn't bad it (37:30 - 37:35)
wasn't good I think kind of what I don't (37:32 - 37:36)
want to I don't want to speak for other (37:35 - 37:36)
people on the show (37:36 - 37:40)
but there was like this it almost felt (37:36 - 37:43)
like it was Lily's story and not your (37:40 - 37:43)
story (37:43 - 37:48)
yeah and they they kind of I don't I (37:43 - 37:51)
personally don't feel like it was uh as (37:48 - 37:54)
bad as black and white where I felt like (37:51 - 37:56)
that story was so focused on n even (37:54 - 38:00)
until the very end of that game mm-hmm (37:56 - 38:02)
whereas at least Lily's Ark wraps up and (38:00 - 38:05)
then they kind of like let you be your (38:02 - 38:08)
own pokemon trainer again and get gear (38:05 - 38:10)
you up for the Elite Four and the the (38:08 - 38:12)
mountain climb and everything yeah (38:10 - 38:16)
life goes on right (38:12 - 38:21)
[Music] (38:16 - 38:22)
I (38:21 - 38:29)
[Music] (38:22 - 38:31)
switching gears a little bit Pokemon go (38:29 - 38:33)
was a phenomenon was that something that (38:31 - 38:37)
stuck with you uh I'm sure it was (38:33 - 38:40)
popular in your city but was was that (38:37 - 38:42)
something happening that sunk its teeth (38:40 - 38:46)
into you yeah initially okay now it's (38:42 - 38:49)
you know the craze has died down a (38:46 - 38:51)
little bit I mean I still see people out (38:49 - 38:56)
there trying to get groups together and (38:51 - 38:58)
building communities around Pokemon go (38:56 - 39:02)
which is super cool and I was more of (38:58 - 39:05)
that in Seattle initially when it came (39:02 - 39:07)
out it was so big like the first day I (39:05 - 39:10)
went to the park and I was already like (39:07 - 39:14)
talking to strangers trying to find rare (39:10 - 39:17)
Pokemon and asking them questions and we (39:14 - 39:20)
would walk side-by-side just like me and (39:17 - 39:22)
someone I'd literally met two minutes (39:20 - 39:24)
ago and we would like be catching (39:22 - 39:26)
pokémon together and was was pretty (39:24 - 39:29)
magical and the fact that it got me out (39:26 - 39:33)
of my room where basically my my studio (39:29 - 39:37)
is my room so it's a it's a bit of a (39:33 - 39:41)
claustrophobic cave sometimes so I had I (39:37 - 39:43)
have to get outside and Pokemon go was a (39:41 - 39:47)
great excuse to leave my room it was (39:43 - 39:51)
also it also really contributed to a (39:47 - 39:54)
like my music got way more popular after (39:51 - 39:57)
Pokemon go to I I was seeing the number (39:54 - 39:59)
of streams some of my tracks were (39:57 - 40:00)
getting on Spotify and a lot of people (39:59 - 40:03)
were adding my music to Pokemon go (40:00 - 40:05)
playlist so they could you know mute the (40:03 - 40:09)
music in game and just play my stuff on (40:05 - 40:10)
their phone while they were walking (40:09 - 40:14)
around which was super cool and kind of (40:10 - 40:18)
flattering yeah yeah yeah I would I (40:14 - 40:20)
would also say that my podcast got (40:18 - 40:22)
really popular after Pokemon go to oh (40:20 - 40:26)
yeah people wanted they just wanted that (40:22 - 40:29)
that that news that information which is (40:26 - 40:32)
I don't I don't know is is that like the (40:29 - 40:35)
age we live in where you see it with (40:32 - 40:36)
like Walking Dead or Game of Thrones (40:35 - 40:38)
it's like as soon as an (40:36 - 40:40)
it is over people want to jump on forums (40:38 - 40:42)
or people want to listen to podcast like (40:40 - 40:45)
people want just more of that and I feel (40:42 - 40:47)
like that didn't exist when gold and (40:45 - 40:50)
silver came out no it was well as (40:47 - 40:52)
definitely more isolated especially if (40:50 - 40:56)
you like grew up without much internet (40:52 - 40:58)
or you had like a bad connection it was (40:56 - 41:02)
hard to connect with people and you'd (40:58 - 41:04)
have to you know actually talk to people (41:02 - 41:07)
at school or something figure out tips (41:04 - 41:11)
and secrets I like though that games are (41:07 - 41:14)
trending more towards putting secret (41:11 - 41:17)
things in that players have to discover (41:14 - 41:19)
later and not including everything in (41:17 - 41:22)
you know a comprehensive guide so that (41:19 - 41:25)
those kinds of discussions can occur (41:22 - 41:28)
same with TV shows and stuff you never (41:25 - 41:30)
know what's coming or even if you do (41:28 - 41:32)
it's really fun to hear other people's (41:30 - 41:35)
input watching reaction videos to those (41:32 - 41:39)
specific scenes I know when I'm gonna go (41:35 - 41:42)
on a tangent slightly okay tangent away (41:39 - 41:45)
when force awakens came out because I'm (41:42 - 41:50)
a huge Star Wars nerd um I literally (41:45 - 41:53)
just like would spend a whole day (41:50 - 41:56)
watching reaction videos of people (41:53 - 41:58)
watching the first teaser trailers and (41:56 - 42:00)
just that people like bursting into (41:58 - 42:02)
tears and then I would start I would (42:00 - 42:08)
like burst into tears so yeah I really (42:02 - 42:11)
like that connection building that goes (42:08 - 42:16)
on online / geeky things like Pokemon go (42:11 - 42:18)
or our Wars or what-have-you (42:16 - 42:22)
yeah what about your favorite franchises (42:18 - 42:25)
so you brought up your music earlier (42:22 - 42:27)
let's let's actually talk about that (42:25 - 42:29)
because that's that's kind of what (42:27 - 42:32)
you're known for yeah so I started (42:29 - 42:36)
learning to write music probably around (42:32 - 42:41)
2010 I I had no like traditional (42:36 - 42:44)
classical musical training I took a few (42:41 - 42:46)
piano lessons when I was in high school (42:44 - 42:47)
but that was about it (42:46 - 42:49)
so I'm pretty much I pretty much (42:47 - 42:52)
self-taught in piano (42:49 - 42:55)
and then later I started doing remixes (42:52 - 42:57)
and arrangements of Pokemon music for (42:55 - 43:01)
fun and by doing that and playing other (42:57 - 43:03)
video game music on the piano I started (43:01 - 43:06)
to learn how to write my own music and (43:03 - 43:08)
eventually that led to me applying to (43:06 - 43:14)
music school and doing more ambitious (43:08 - 43:16)
projects like my first Pokemon album (43:14 - 43:19)
Kanto Symphony which came out the same (43:16 - 43:21)
year that I started music school you (43:19 - 43:23)
went from you know teaching your stuff (43:21 - 43:26)
music to putting out an album yeah I (43:23 - 43:28)
guess there was a lot that happened (43:26 - 43:34)
in-between so when I was in college at (43:28 - 43:38)
public university um my first two years (43:34 - 43:41)
of undergrad I was messing around with (43:38 - 43:44)
music well while I was I was getting (43:41 - 43:46)
ready to major in international studies (43:44 - 43:49)
but I was doing a lot of music stuff on (43:46 - 43:51)
the side and started doing Pokemon (43:49 - 43:58)
remixes with Orchestra vsts and (43:51 - 44:00)
eventually I started getting good enough (43:58 - 44:02)
that I felt like oh maybe I should (44:00 - 44:05)
invest in some higher quality vsts so I (44:02 - 44:07)
I picked up some sample libraries using (44:05 - 44:11)
some financial aid money or at least (44:07 - 44:15)
money that I'd saved after having my (44:11 - 44:19)
housing covered for a quarter sure so (44:15 - 44:21)
being a responsible adult and all that (44:19 - 44:27)
and then I started doing like hey you (44:21 - 44:28)
gotta you got to spend money to make (44:27 - 44:29)
money (44:28 - 44:32)
yeah exactly at the time though I wasn't (44:29 - 44:35)
even making money so it was it was (44:32 - 44:40)
definitely a sunken cost but I mean (44:35 - 44:42)
eventually it it paid off yeah so I was (44:40 - 44:46)
I was just doing a lot of orchestral (44:42 - 44:49)
arrangements and learning how to write (44:46 - 44:52)
convincing sounding um orchestral music (44:49 - 44:55)
while I was in undergrad and then I kind (44:52 - 44:59)
of realized oh man I don't know if this (44:55 - 45:01)
is like International Studies is really (44:59 - 45:05)
what I want to do so I ended up (45:01 - 45:09)
dropping out and applying to several (45:05 - 45:13)
music schools while owning my music (45:09 - 45:17)
skills and that eventually led me to (45:13 - 45:21)
tackling music from the first Pokemon (45:17 - 45:23)
games red and blue and arranging them (45:21 - 45:28)
for full orchestra which was my first (45:23 - 45:31)
choice I would have probably been to (45:28 - 45:35)
arrange gold and silver oh yeah because (45:31 - 45:36)
those were the games I started with but (45:35 - 45:40)
I saw so many people responding (45:36 - 45:43)
positively to some other red and blue (45:40 - 45:45)
arrangements that I was doing and (45:43 - 45:48)
uploading to youtube and stuff and I I (45:45 - 45:50)
started getting excited about working on (45:48 - 45:54)
gen1 music and wanted to do something (45:50 - 45:58)
that was like you know a full-scale (45:54 - 46:01)
orchestral arrangement of the original (45:58 - 46:03)
soundtrack the whole soundtrack to red (46:01 - 46:06)
and blue I thought I can do it because (46:03 - 46:09)
it was um it was a lot shorter than (46:06 - 46:12)
golden sulfur so there was less less (46:09 - 46:14)
music to orchestrate but I thought it (46:12 - 46:17)
would also be a fun way to go back to my (46:14 - 46:20)
roots so to speak as a Pokemon fan and (46:17 - 46:23)
rediscover what made you know the (46:20 - 46:26)
original franchise so magical with the (46:23 - 46:30)
very first game so I I revisited the (46:26 - 46:33)
world of red and blue through my (46:30 - 46:38)
arrangements and that I finished a about (46:33 - 46:41)
a year later after dropping out of (46:38 - 46:46)
undergrad and then um it was released (46:41 - 46:48)
and a bunch of people really liked it I (46:46 - 46:53)
guess yes thank you let me let me back (46:48 - 46:56)
up a little bit uh for our listeners and (46:53 - 46:59)
for you Braxton I have I am the most (46:56 - 47:03)
music I I can't do anything with music I (46:59 - 47:05)
can't play an instrument I can't dance I (47:03 - 47:09)
can't follow a beat so that's totally (47:05 - 47:11)
fine this understanding of I don't know (47:09 - 47:14)
how people make this stuff like I get (47:11 - 47:17)
the concept but oh sure it's like people (47:14 - 47:18)
who like the (47:17 - 47:20)
understand drawing but they they can't (47:18 - 47:22)
draw anything past a sick person so you (47:20 - 47:25)
you said you played a little piano and (47:22 - 47:27)
then you went from making a whole album (47:25 - 47:29)
you so you're telling me you didn't (47:27 - 47:31)
really play any other instruments or (47:29 - 47:34)
anything like that you just sat down and (47:31 - 47:36)
wrote music which is like this like a (47:34 - 47:40)
Spanish to me yeah have no clue how to (47:36 - 47:43)
understand this written language yeah I (47:40 - 47:45)
guess I could break it down a little bit (47:43 - 47:48)
like what my how I actually taught (47:45 - 47:50)
myself because I know there are a lot of (47:48 - 47:53)
people out there who maybe feel the same (47:50 - 47:57)
way like they're maybe not as musical or (47:53 - 48:01)
not sure if they have the proper skills (47:57 - 48:05)
to like go into music but like when I (48:01 - 48:07)
started out I guess my background (48:05 - 48:10)
actually started when I did choir in (48:07 - 48:12)
high school I couldn't actually sight (48:10 - 48:14)
read music at all so I would just (48:12 - 48:17)
literally I think I'm saying literally a (48:14 - 48:21)
lot when I was in choir I actually would (48:17 - 48:24)
just listen to my section leader sing (48:21 - 48:27)
the part and then I would parrot him and (48:24 - 48:30)
just blend in so I got really good at (48:27 - 48:34)
picking out parts by ear so I guess that (48:30 - 48:36)
really helped me when I started to learn (48:34 - 48:39)
piano because I could sort of hear where (48:36 - 48:41)
the music was going even if I couldn't (48:39 - 48:43)
even if it took me forever to read music (48:41 - 48:46)
and I also bought a children's piano (48:43 - 48:50)
book like piano learning book uh to (48:46 - 48:53)
teach myself because that's it was (48:50 - 48:55)
honestly the best way to learn because (48:53 - 48:58)
it teaches you the proper thing finger (48:55 - 49:00)
technique which fingers to play with (48:58 - 49:04)
first for what notes how to play scales (49:00 - 49:07)
and I would play dinky stuff like (49:04 - 49:10)
twinkle twinkle little star and that's (49:07 - 49:13)
how I learned how to become more agile (49:10 - 49:16)
on the piano and then I think the first (49:13 - 49:19)
actual video game track that I learned (49:16 - 49:21)
to play that I was really excited about (49:19 - 49:23)
was to Zanarkand (49:21 - 49:26)
from Final Fantasy 10 by Nobuo Uematsu (49:23 - 49:29)
which is a beautiful beautiful piano (49:26 - 49:32)
piece and simple enough that I could (49:29 - 49:32)
play it (49:32 - 49:34)
it took me two months to like learn how (49:32 - 49:37)
to play it with both hands and I had to (49:34 - 49:39)
like learn how to play one part on one (49:37 - 49:42)
hand one part on the other and then try (49:39 - 49:45)
putting them together and it's it's (49:42 - 49:48)
really hard work just learning in the (49:45 - 49:51)
beginning how to play piano pieces (49:48 - 49:53)
because you do have to play with both (49:51 - 49:56)
hands so once you once you become agile (49:53 - 49:59)
enough and once you learn to like split (49:56 - 50:00)
your brain into two to play the bass (49:59 - 50:05)
line and melody and all that stuff you (50:00 - 50:08)
just practice and practice over and over (50:05 - 50:11)
my parents got real sick of my playing (50:08 - 50:15)
after a while yeah honestly it just it's (50:11 - 50:19)
hours of repetition slowing down your (50:15 - 50:22)
pace so playing a piece a lot slower (50:19 - 50:26)
than it actually is when you perform it (50:22 - 50:30)
at full speed because that that helps (50:26 - 50:33)
you to ingrain muscle memory and your (50:30 - 50:34)
fingertips (50:33 - 50:36)
you know you'll you'll just memorize (50:34 - 50:39)
through muscles where your fingers need (50:36 - 50:40)
to land when you're playing so (50:39 - 50:42)
eventually you're not even thinking (50:40 - 50:46)
about oh I need to play this note here (50:42 - 50:48)
and then I need to play this next on (50:46 - 50:52)
this beat yeah learning piano is if you (50:48 - 50:55)
if you invest the time it's it's not too (50:52 - 50:59)
bad but that's is you just gotta put in (50:55 - 51:03)
the time as far as working with like (50:59 - 51:07)
remixes and playing with instruments on (51:03 - 51:09)
the computer I I started with GarageBand (51:07 - 51:12)
honestly and a lot of people I know (51:09 - 51:17)
still use GarageBand and video edited in (51:12 - 51:21)
GarageBand for probably the first 150 (51:17 - 51:23)
some episodes hahaha (51:21 - 51:26)
I mean GarageBand is pretty solid it's a (51:23 - 51:29)
it's a really good digital audio (51:26 - 51:32)
workstation most people you know don't (51:29 - 51:35)
need all the bells and whistles of a lot (51:32 - 51:38)
of other sequencers so and I use (51:35 - 51:41)
GarageBand forever too until I started (51:38 - 51:43)
getting more sophisticated with my (51:41 - 51:44)
arrangements and (51:43 - 51:48)
but like professional orchestral sample (51:44 - 51:53)
libraries which cost a pretty penny but (51:48 - 51:55)
as a college student I had disposable (51:53 - 51:58)
income from my job and I didn't have any (51:55 - 52:02)
debt yet yet yes you were there yeah (51:58 - 52:03)
exactly (52:02 - 52:06)
so yeah IIIi invested in better (52:03 - 52:09)
instruments as I got better at writing (52:06 - 52:13)
and um was listening to a lot of (52:09 - 52:16)
orchestral music I'm such a huge like (52:13 - 52:20)
soundtrack freak I love movie scores and (52:16 - 52:22)
video game music so I'm constantly (52:20 - 52:26)
listening to um some kind of orchestral (52:22 - 52:30)
thing when I'm not working and all of (52:26 - 52:32)
that helped me and develop my ear for (52:30 - 52:34)
what sounds natural for an orchestra and (52:32 - 52:37)
eventually when I went to school that (52:34 - 52:39)
was all kind of like solidified and I (52:37 - 52:42)
built like an infrastructure for (52:39 - 52:45)
learning orchestration through like a (52:42 - 52:49)
you know formal training tying music (52:45 - 52:52)
theory to orchestration and so it all (52:49 - 52:55)
started being more cohesive and my music (52:52 - 53:00)
got a lot better after I was in school (52:55 - 53:00)
[Music] (53:04 - 53:11)
tell me about your first Kickstarter (53:15 - 53:20)
here it's Pokemon reorg straited (53:17 - 53:24)
presents double team you had 937 backers (53:20 - 53:29)
$21,000 this was early 2013 yeah that (53:24 - 53:32)
sounds about right yeah it was um just (53:29 - 53:35)
hearing those numbers again is like so (53:32 - 53:40)
cool I I'm just astounded at how many (53:35 - 53:43)
Pokemon fans really love the orchestral (53:40 - 53:46)
arrangements that me and my friend Eric (53:43 - 53:49)
who was co-producer on the album did (53:46 - 53:52)
yeah double team was sort of born out of (53:49 - 53:57)
a desire to work with live players like (53:52 - 54:00)
before going to music school I'd work (53:57 - 54:03)
exclusively with virtual instruments and (54:00 - 54:07)
synthesized orchestral instruments so (54:03 - 54:09)
I'd never actually talked to a live (54:07 - 54:11)
player and asked them hey is this (54:09 - 54:14)
actually playable okay I was just kind (54:11 - 54:16)
of going off of what sounded right to my (54:14 - 54:19)
ear so Phaedra can do it better than you (54:16 - 54:23)
yeah i exact well yeah in some cases and (54:19 - 54:25)
a lot a lot of my music that I write is (54:23 - 54:27)
even it's still pretty difficult for (54:25 - 54:30)
live players uh I've gotten good enough (54:27 - 54:33)
where I can like write a part that is (54:30 - 54:37)
literally it's playable but you know (54:33 - 54:41)
might be best played by a professional (54:37 - 54:45)
orchestra like the London Symphony but (54:41 - 54:49)
um like yeah top tier yeah a lot of my (54:45 - 54:52)
early music suffered from clunkiness and (54:49 - 54:58)
awkward instrumentation non idiomatic (54:52 - 55:01)
writing that just sounded super fake so (54:58 - 55:04)
going to school I formed the small (55:01 - 55:06)
ensemble to perform a Nintendo medley (55:04 - 55:09)
and I invited Eric to come rehearse with (55:06 - 55:11)
us cuz that was my first time in front (55:09 - 55:13)
of live human beings trying to like (55:11 - 55:16)
conduct an ensemble and so he was there (55:13 - 55:18)
he he'd worked with he's worked with (55:16 - 55:19)
live musicians before he's a (55:18 - 55:22)
percussionist so he's played in various (55:19 - 55:26)
bands and ensembles and we rehearsed (55:22 - 55:27)
together and then when we went home (55:26 - 55:30)
later that night we were talking about (55:27 - 55:34)
how cool it would be to actually book a (55:30 - 55:39)
professional orchestra to play stuff (55:34 - 55:41)
like Pokemon music which was what I was (55:39 - 55:46)
doing and at the time and and he Erica's (55:41 - 55:49)
is pretty much a go-getter and said well (55:46 - 55:51)
why not let's just do a Kickstarter (55:49 - 55:53)
we've done Kickstarter's in the past and (55:51 - 55:58)
I was like oh okay so yeah then we (55:53 - 56:01)
launched a Kickstarter to work with a (55:58 - 56:03)
bunch of Seattle Symphony players in (56:01 - 56:08)
studio X in downtown Seattle and yeah I (56:03 - 56:11)
was all crowd funded and got all of the (56:08 - 56:14)
music prepped and performed and recorded (56:11 - 56:18)
with live steering players live piano (56:14 - 56:22)
it was the most harrowing experience in (56:18 - 56:26)
my entire life just learning it was (56:22 - 56:28)
definitely a trial by fire I learned (56:26 - 56:32)
very quickly how to notate music how to (56:28 - 56:35)
write for a live ensemble what things (56:32 - 56:37)
worked what things didn't after hearing (56:35 - 56:41)
them perform stuff and so it at the same (56:37 - 56:44)
time as scary as it was it was an (56:41 - 56:50)
invaluable lesson in writing music so it (56:44 - 56:53)
was um I was very grateful to our (56:50 - 56:54)
backers and I'm so grateful to everyone (56:53 - 56:58)
who made that album a reality because it (56:54 - 57:03)
it really improved my own music and we (56:58 - 57:05)
got to write cool Pokemon arrangements (57:03 - 57:08)
well you wrote you wrote more after that (57:05 - 57:09)
you launched (57:08 - 57:14)
hoenn summer yeah I miss Hoenn yeah I (57:09 - 57:16)
feel like no one no one mentions Hoenn (57:14 - 57:20)
summer as much as say TT more canto (57:16 - 57:23)
symphony cuz or aza just come out when I (57:20 - 57:26)
really tell in summer and so I was I was (57:23 - 57:30)
on all aboard the hype train but uh yeah (57:26 - 57:33)
I I tried to throw in as many trumpets (57:30 - 57:35)
in there as I could you know if the (57:33 - 57:37)
hoenn fans what they want I don't know (57:35 - 57:39)
how to phrase this question so you did (57:37 - 57:41)
all that you did double-team you did (57:39 - 57:43)
albums before you did Hoenn summer and (57:41 - 57:46)
then big Papa Pokemon company came along (57:43 - 57:49)
and they were like let's do Pokemon (57:46 - 57:52)
symphonic evolutions and let's tour the (57:49 - 57:55)
world yeah which you know they have (57:52 - 57:57)
every right to write it's their (57:55 - 57:59)
franchise but yeah there they were (57:57 - 58:01)
definitely kind of stepping on a niche (57:59 - 58:05)
that you and Eric I don't say I don't (58:01 - 58:07)
know how much involvement Eric has (58:05 - 58:10)
besides oh well on double team yeah he (58:07 - 58:13)
was he was co-producer every every other (58:10 - 58:16)
Pokemon ray or castrated release was me (58:13 - 58:19)
but I've also I also include a lot of (58:16 - 58:21)
the musicians we've worked with under (58:19 - 58:24)
the Pokemon reor castrated umbrella so (58:21 - 58:27)
oh I understand the confusion there okay (58:24 - 58:29)
that makes sense so you know they're (58:27 - 58:31)
kind of stepping on that this niche that (58:29 - 58:33)
you had and I'm sure other artists have (58:31 - 58:36)
done Pokemon music remixes you know all (58:33 - 58:39)
other stuff so how like was that (58:36 - 58:40)
exciting for you was that frustrating (58:39 - 58:44)
for you was that did they did they even (58:40 - 58:46)
talk to you not that they need to talk (58:44 - 58:48)
to you but were they like hey we like (58:46 - 58:51)
your music no yeah actually I'm I'm good (58:48 - 58:54)
friends with Jaron more the producer of (58:51 - 58:57)
Pokemon symphonic evolutions he also (58:54 - 58:59)
produced Legend of Zelda symphony of the (58:57 - 59:03)
goddesses and I attended both shows (58:59 - 59:06)
multiple times in my city and even other (59:03 - 59:09)
cities when I was traveling and I (59:06 - 59:11)
absolutely love the work that Jaron and (59:09 - 59:15)
Chad do Chad the arranger for both Zelda (59:11 - 59:19)
Symphony and Pokemon Symphony it was (59:15 - 59:22)
actually I was actually really (59:19 - 59:24)
flattered to be approached by Jaron (59:22 - 59:28)
before they had proposed the idea of the (59:24 - 59:32)
symphony to the Pokemon company and he (59:28 - 59:34)
actually consulted with me and Eric on (59:32 - 59:38)
some of our favorites from our favorite (59:34 - 59:41)
tunes from the Pokemon franchise and got (59:38 - 59:43)
a lot of feedback from us we worked with (59:41 - 59:46)
him to kind of develop a program for the (59:43 - 59:51)
concert and give a we gave him you know (59:46 - 59:54)
our opinions on what pieces worked what (59:51 - 59:57)
didn't for a live show and then the rest (59:54 - 60:01)
was all them they ran with all of the (59:57 - 60:03)
pieces that they come up with and (60:01 - 60:05)
arranged them all and orchestrated (60:03 - 60:08)
everything and honestly it was it having (60:05 - 60:12)
a Pokemon concert IRL that people could (60:08 - 60:14)
attend and listen to yeah I was super (60:12 - 60:20)
stoked so it may have seemed to on the (60:14 - 60:21)
outside that they might have been (60:20 - 60:24)
stepping on my toes but honestly it was (60:21 - 60:26)
it was super I thought it was super (60:24 - 60:28)
awesome that they were doing it and it (60:26 - 60:29)
was something I'd dreamed up for awhile (60:28 - 60:34)
and I actually hope that it pushed the (60:29 - 60:38)
Pokemon company towards doing more live (60:34 - 60:40)
recordings for the games themselves in (60:38 - 60:42)
the future after they've seen the (60:40 - 60:44)
reception to the the concerts you know (60:42 - 60:48)
it would be super neat to see them do (60:44 - 60:51)
more recording with live orchestra for (60:48 - 60:54)
future soundtracks so I think it's all (60:51 - 60:57)
progress what I do what symphonic (60:54 - 61:00)
evolutions is doing and I sort of see (60:57 - 61:03)
that as the concert series as an (61:00 - 61:06)
extension of kind of what I do but more (61:03 - 61:10)
for an act like a concert going (61:06 - 61:13)
experience versus something where you're (61:10 - 61:15)
like sitting down and my albums have a (61:13 - 61:18)
narrative to them which is not the case (61:15 - 61:20)
with symphonic evolutions there are a (61:18 - 61:22)
couple of movements like the black and (61:20 - 61:24)
white movement that you're very (61:22 - 61:27)
cinematic and story driven but for the (61:24 - 61:29)
most part it's like you know the best (61:27 - 61:31)
hits of the Pokemon series where as I (61:29 - 61:34)
like to I like to take you know music (61:31 - 61:35)
from a single gen (61:34 - 61:39)
and focus in on that and try to distill (61:35 - 61:41)
the essence of a particular game like (61:39 - 61:44)
red and blue or right now gold and (61:41 - 61:47)
silver and develop a listening (61:44 - 61:51)
experience that has a kind of story as a (61:47 - 61:54)
the backbone for all of the tracks (61:51 - 61:57)
before we get to your current (61:54 - 62:00)
Kickstarter which has about a week left (61:57 - 62:06)
ah how do you get maybe maybe there's a (62:00 - 62:08)
really simple answer maybe it's really (62:06 - 62:10)
complicated and we'll take too much time (62:08 - 62:12)
but you're selling pretty much pokemon (62:10 - 62:17)
music and tcpi knows that you're doing (62:12 - 62:19)
it obviously mm-hmm (62:17 - 62:22)
how is that not a conflict of interest (62:19 - 62:23)
of like yeah you changed the music (62:22 - 62:25)
slightly well not slightly I'm sure (62:23 - 62:28)
there's so much work oh yeah no it's not (62:25 - 62:31)
slightly but again what you're saying (62:28 - 62:34)
yeah how is how is there not like hey (62:31 - 62:36)
take this music down you're making money (62:34 - 62:39)
off off what what was originally (62:36 - 62:42)
something we created right and the whole (62:39 - 62:45)
legality of releasing covers whether (62:42 - 62:48)
it's video game music or covers of pop (62:45 - 62:50)
songs things like that those can be (62:48 - 62:54)
licensed which is exactly what we've (62:50 - 62:58)
done for my past releases we've so we (62:54 - 63:00)
have what is called a compulsory license (62:58 - 63:03)
and I'm working with Sebastian wool from (63:00 - 63:06)
the materia collective which releases a (63:03 - 63:10)
bunch of original and cover albums of (63:06 - 63:14)
video game music and basically he and my (63:10 - 63:18)
past labels handle the licensing where (63:14 - 63:22)
we take a composition that is featured (63:18 - 63:26)
in a song of mine so say I have like the (63:22 - 63:28)
main theme the main pokemon theme from (63:26 - 63:32)
red and blue and I want to you know (63:28 - 63:34)
release that and sell that on iTunes and (63:32 - 63:37)
put it on Spotify and stuff so the (63:34 - 63:40)
compulsory license mechanical license (63:37 - 63:46)
allows you to cite one composition for (63:40 - 63:49)
nine cents per sale digital sale of the (63:46 - 63:53)
album or the track getting into like (63:49 - 63:57)
complex business e copyright stuff but (63:53 - 64:00)
yeah so for nine cents per composition (63:57 - 64:03)
featured in a track you can then license (64:00 - 64:06)
that track and release it and so (64:03 - 64:09)
basically what we do is we list all of (64:06 - 64:11)
the compositions we're licensing that (64:09 - 64:13)
have been published by the Pokemon (64:11 - 64:17)
company already on iTunes because as you (64:13 - 64:19)
might know they they actually have all (64:17 - 64:21)
of the soundtracks or most of the (64:19 - 64:23)
soundtracks on iTunes for the Pokemon (64:21 - 64:26)
games yeah to eat we cite those (64:23 - 64:30)
compositions and license all of those (64:26 - 64:33)
add up the total amount of royalties (64:30 - 64:35)
owed to the Pokemon company and then (64:33 - 64:37)
basically cut them a check every month (64:35 - 64:40)
after all of the sales from the music (64:37 - 64:42)
comes and I would I would hope that (64:40 - 64:44)
somebody does that for you like you're (64:42 - 64:46)
not yeah you're not sitting there in (64:44 - 64:49)
your studio going well we sold three of (64:46 - 64:51)
the title screen for red and blue so (64:49 - 64:55)
that's 27 cents it's uh ya know um (64:51 - 64:58)
my previous label louder handled all of (64:55 - 65:01)
my licensing for me and Sebastian who (64:58 - 65:05)
was a co-founder of louder is now (65:01 - 65:07)
handling licensing for me he is a (65:05 - 65:11)
spreadsheet wizard so it's a and he's (65:07 - 65:14)
got everything automated so he he's the (65:11 - 65:15)
one who kind of handles all of that he (65:14 - 65:17)
he doesn't weigh more efficiently than I (65:15 - 65:20)
could and most people know musicians are (65:17 - 65:24)
probably not great accountant so the as (65:20 - 65:28)
if everything is legally licensed and (65:24 - 65:31)
available for sale with all proper (65:28 - 65:32)
royalties paid to the Pokemon company (65:31 - 65:36)
got it I'm just I guess I'm kind of (65:32 - 65:40)
surprised that you know other composers (65:36 - 65:43)
is that the right word other composers (65:40 - 65:45)
don't do that with other video games (65:43 - 65:49)
like you don't see halo remixes or (65:45 - 65:52)
destiny remixes or final phantom a B I'm (65:49 - 65:54)
just not looking hard enough but mmm if (65:52 - 65:56)
it's that easy of saying hey I just want (65:54 - 65:58)
to license this and I'm going to cut you (65:56 - 66:00)
a check for you know nine cents of the (65:58 - 66:03)
dollar per song you would think that (66:00 - 66:03)
more of (66:03 - 66:05)
those would be popping up yeah and I (66:03 - 66:07)
think for a while it was just about (66:05 - 66:11)
accessibility to the kinds of labels and (66:07 - 66:16)
partners publishers that gave artists (66:11 - 66:19)
the ability to license songs for covers (66:16 - 66:22)
louder was one of the first really big (66:19 - 66:27)
online retailers and labels that allowed (66:22 - 66:31)
musicians to do video game covers and so (66:27 - 66:34)
it was it's I think it's becoming a lot (66:31 - 66:37)
more prevalent now and before it was (66:34 - 66:41)
pretty unheard of so yeah it's uh it's (66:37 - 66:43)
pretty cool actually seeing all of the (66:41 - 66:46)
kinds of covers that come out for video (66:43 - 66:48)
games nowadays like I'm playing persona (66:46 - 66:51)
5 right now when I'm not working on the (66:48 - 66:52)
album like I'll take breaks to play (66:51 - 66:55)
persona and I'll go on Twitter and see (66:52 - 66:58)
people like posting vocal covers of (66:55 - 67:02)
persona songs and it's really cool to (66:58 - 67:06)
now see this thriving community of video (67:02 - 67:10)
game artists and Rangers and cover bands (67:06 - 67:14)
and things doing interpretations of all (67:10 - 67:17)
this video game music in various genres (67:14 - 67:20)
not just you know orchestral things yeah (67:17 - 67:21)
it's it's pretty awesome (67:20 - 67:38)
[Music] (67:21 - 67:42)
speaking of Awesome Johto legends music (67:38 - 67:45)
from pokemon gold and pokemon silver (67:42 - 67:48)
currently on Kickstarter we're recording (67:45 - 67:50)
we're recording this a little early so (67:48 - 67:51)
right now it says nine days left you (67:50 - 67:54)
have 574 backers you're at 20,000 (67:51 - 67:58)
dollars out of 30,000 so goal goal is (67:54 - 68:00)
definitely obtainable here but tell me (67:58 - 68:03)
tell me about this Kickstarter so this (68:00 - 68:06)
is a project that is near and dear to my (68:03 - 68:09)
heart like I mentioned earlier I my (68:06 - 68:12)
first choice if I was going to you know (68:09 - 68:18)
exclude the opinions of other people and (68:12 - 68:20)
be really super selfish I would have (68:18 - 68:23)
tackled the music of gold and silver (68:20 - 68:26)
first because it was such an important (68:23 - 68:29)
it was such an integral part of my (68:26 - 68:32)
childhood exploring the johto region and (68:29 - 68:35)
encountering the legendaries like ho-oh (68:32 - 68:37)
and lugia and all the you know the beast (68:35 - 68:42)
trio they raikou and suicune and up (68:37 - 68:46)
until this point I actually didn't feel (68:42 - 68:48)
competent enough in my musical abilities (68:46 - 68:52)
to pull off an album of gold and silver (68:48 - 68:54)
orchestrations that really did the music (68:52 - 68:58)
justice so now I feel like I'm ready and (68:54 - 69:00)
I've written I'm almost done with the (68:58 - 69:03)
album now and what I want to do is take (69:00 - 69:05)
it to the next level not just have (69:03 - 69:08)
virtual instruments like I've used in (69:05 - 69:10)
the past but kind of do something (69:08 - 69:13)
in-between say canto symphonies virtual (69:10 - 69:15)
instruments and double-teams all live (69:13 - 69:18)
ensemble where it's a mix so this (69:15 - 69:21)
Kickstarter is to raise funds for live (69:18 - 69:26)
musicians to perform parts for Johto (69:21 - 69:28)
legends all music from pokemon gold and (69:26 - 69:32)
silver and it's also to raise funds to (69:28 - 69:35)
produce a physical CD copies of the (69:32 - 69:37)
album when it's released so people can (69:35 - 69:40)
get these really beautiful albums with (69:37 - 69:42)
it's going to feature some stunning (69:40 - 69:46)
album artwork by the double-team cover (69:42 - 69:49)
designer Franz Anthony (69:46 - 69:56)
and are also super excited to just you (69:49 - 69:59)
know be um sorry I lost my train of (69:56 - 70:01)
thought so the met the mastering of (69:59 - 70:03)
cutting and editing I'll make you sound (70:01 - 70:06)
real good actually speaking of mastering (70:03 - 70:08)
and editing that's that's also part of (70:06 - 70:13)
the Kickstarter uh good segue actually (70:08 - 70:16)
for the first time in my musical career (70:13 - 70:20)
we want to raise funds to hire a (70:16 - 70:22)
professional sound engineer to mix and (70:20 - 70:26)
master the album as opposed to me just (70:22 - 70:29)
like slapping a compressor and a you (70:26 - 70:33)
know limiter and calling it good for I (70:29 - 70:35)
that might be lost on some people but (70:33 - 70:38)
like a hundred percent know what you (70:35 - 70:41)
need in that aspect it's just kind of a (70:38 - 70:43)
quick and dirty like oh yeah the album's (70:41 - 70:45)
done sure it's like peaking meaning like (70:43 - 70:48)
there's some distortion in the audio but (70:45 - 70:51)
like I'll just turn it down a little bit (70:48 - 70:56)
it's all good it's good right no no so (70:51 - 70:58)
we're we want to get it professionally (70:56 - 71:02)
mixed and mastered so the whole album is (70:58 - 71:05)
produced to the highest quality (71:02 - 71:07)
possible-- so when you put on your (71:05 - 71:09)
headphones you really get sucked into (71:07 - 71:12)
the music the the stereo field is wide (71:09 - 71:15)
and everything is rich in detail then (71:12 - 71:18)
it's it's nothings fuzzy and or (71:15 - 71:20)
compressed so yeah basically make it (71:18 - 71:23)
sound as good as possible do physical (71:20 - 71:25)
CDs and higher live players to perform (71:23 - 71:29)
along side orchestral really high (71:25 - 71:32)
quality orchestral samples well that's (71:29 - 71:34)
awesome well that is currently on (71:32 - 71:37)
Kickstarter probably just my advice (71:34 - 71:39)
would probably be searching for Johto (71:37 - 71:41)
legends that will probably get you right (71:39 - 71:44)
there on Kickstarter I'll have a link to (71:41 - 71:47)
the Kickstarter in the show notes thank (71:44 - 71:50)
you so much yeah we're uh we're coming (71:47 - 71:54)
down to the wire on this one yeah yeah (71:50 - 71:57)
totally but but we'll make sure that our (71:54 - 71:59)
Twitter and everything gets gets us (71:57 - 72:01)
promoted for your last week it's always (71:59 - 72:02)
like the first like couple days (72:01 - 72:04)
is another last couple days those are (72:02 - 72:07)
the most important yeah I'm not too (72:04 - 72:09)
worried honestly because most people do (72:07 - 72:11)
kind of like pledge at the last minute (72:09 - 72:14)
so I'm that guy I used to pledge first (72:11 - 72:16)
minute and I have now completely I will (72:14 - 72:19)
wait till last minute every time oh yeah (72:16 - 72:22)
oh I do it too I'm totally guilty so (72:19 - 72:25)
it's it's understandable to when people (72:22 - 72:28)
and I think it's part of Kickstarter (72:25 - 72:30)
statistics or something - when every (72:28 - 72:33)
project that kind of reaches half of its (72:30 - 72:36)
goal you know within a week or two of (72:33 - 72:39)
its a deadline is usually going to get (72:36 - 72:42)
funded is the statistic or something (72:39 - 72:45)
like that yeah it's because people you (72:42 - 72:49)
know want to see if the project is (72:45 - 72:51)
worthwhile and if it's going somewhere (72:49 - 72:53)
and if it hits the 50 percent mark (72:51 - 72:56)
that's kind of like a signal to people (72:53 - 72:57)
like oh yeah (72:56 - 72:59)
this this is something we really really (72:57 - 73:01)
want to push through but couldn't make (72:59 - 73:04)
up their mind before it hit super-sized (73:01 - 73:09)
totally I got one measure of faith yeah (73:04 - 73:11)
I got one more question for you Braxton (73:09 - 73:13)
before we wrap it up here uh what is (73:11 - 73:17)
your favorite Pokemon ah how dare you (73:13 - 73:21)
there I asked these hard questions this (73:17 - 73:24)
is you're pitting me against all the (73:21 - 73:27)
other Pokemon fans out there who like (73:24 - 73:31)
how specific gens are your favorite oh (73:27 - 73:34)
god like I don't want to say this (73:31 - 73:36)
because it'll make it sound like I'm a (73:34 - 73:39)
gen 1 or when I'm really a Gen 2 ha ha (73:36 - 73:43)
but I I really love Charizard I've been (73:39 - 73:45)
like wow yeah I've been drawing (73:43 - 73:48)
Charizard fan art since I was a little (73:45 - 73:50)
kid since I could like I watched the (73:48 - 73:52)
Pokemon anime before I ever played the (73:50 - 73:54)
games in Charizard was probably my (73:52 - 73:57)
favorite Pokemon back then too so oh (73:54 - 73:59)
yeah definitely (73:57 - 74:02)
Charizard I was on bad choice I mean the (73:59 - 74:04)
atleast didn't pick like Lucario or (74:02 - 74:08)
something ah no hating on Lucario yeah (74:04 - 74:11)
we have a long-running joke where the (74:08 - 74:12)
whole show hates Lucario but in reality (74:11 - 74:16)
currently in reality he's okay he's (74:12 - 74:19)
he puts ia market if I had to pick a (74:16 - 74:22)
newer Pokemon that was my favorite I (74:19 - 74:26)
would probably say beware oh yeah beware (74:22 - 74:28)
is really great it's like one of the few (74:26 - 74:30)
things the anime does really good is (74:28 - 74:32)
like give gives justice to certain (74:30 - 74:36)
Pokemon oh my gosh yeah beware is one of (74:32 - 74:40)
those the Sun in Moon anime is so good I (74:36 - 74:42)
love the animation and like yeah like (74:40 - 74:45)
you said the the Pokemon characters (74:42 - 74:47)
themselves they actually like feel alive (74:45 - 74:50)
and have personalities beware is the (74:47 - 74:54)
greatest part of the anime and they're (74:50 - 74:56)
the team rocket's relationship would be (74:54 - 75:00)
we're just like oh it's so cute I'm a (74:56 - 75:01)
little behind on the end of my have to (75:00 - 75:03)
catch up I've only done the I've only (75:01 - 75:05)

come back we will do some emails and our (76:17 - 76:22)
Pokemon of the week we will be right (76:20 - 76:23)
back (76:22 - 76:28)
[Music] (76:23 - 76:29)
[Applause] (76:28 - 76:59)
[Music] (76:29 - 76:59)
[Applause] (76:59 - 77:07)
[Music] (76:59 - 77:07)
and we are back from our break let's (77:08 - 77:17)
let's talk about the hit mobile game (77:13 - 77:20)
Magikarp jump which I might attempt like (77:17 - 77:24)
I might call splash Magikarp because (77:20 - 77:27)
that's what it was in Japan I actually (77:24 - 77:28)
like I like that name better I realize (77:27 - 77:32)
why it's so awkward because isn't splash (77:28 - 77:34)
itself the original move a (77:32 - 77:36)
mistranslation wasn't it always supposed (77:34 - 77:37)
to be jump and that's why things like (77:36 - 77:40)
hoppip know it but it was mistranslated (77:37 - 77:43)
as splash and so that the whole joke of (77:40 - 77:46)
the game sort of gets lost because why (77:43 - 77:48)
is Magikarp jumping well it's because it (77:46 - 77:49)
always has we just didn't know it's (77:48 - 77:52)
weird whatever yeah so in Japan (77:49 - 77:54)
magikarps movies jump in America they (77:52 - 77:57)
translated it to splash which is wait (77:54 - 77:58)
would you like me to read the official (77:57 - 78:00)
Bubba paediatrician yeah go ahead (77:58 - 78:03)
while it's English name suggests in (78:00 - 78:04)
association with water it's Japanese (78:03 - 78:07)
name squiggly squiggly squiggly Janero (78:04 - 78:11)
can mean both splash and hop but usually (78:07 - 78:14)
the latter this explains why the move (78:11 - 78:16)
can be learned by Pokemon such as spoink (78:14 - 78:18)
and hop it species who have no (78:16 - 78:20)
association with water but are known for (78:18 - 78:22)
hopping or jumping and why it is (78:20 - 78:24)
disabled by gravity it's somewhat (78:22 - 78:26)
misleading English name is likely due to (78:24 - 78:30)
its initial exclusivity to Magikarp it's (78:26 - 78:31)
almost like that's exactly what I (78:30 - 78:34)
already said yes but I just read the (78:31 - 78:36)
official word that's not official media (78:34 - 78:41)
video yeah okay so I also I I take (78:36 - 78:43)
umbrage with your describing this as a (78:41 - 78:46)
game it's certainly fun and cute it is (78:43 - 78:48)
just a skinner box though right it's (78:46 - 78:50)
just I mean it's a temper that's the (78:48 - 78:52)
buttons you press the buttons that the (78:50 - 78:54)
game tells you to press and you get (78:52 - 78:58)
rewarded for it and there's no skill or (78:54 - 79:01)
anything of the sort involved except for (78:58 - 79:04)
the occasional decision to play it safe (79:01 - 79:06)
or have your Magikarp die like other (79:04 - 79:10)
than that it's just I think you press (79:06 - 79:12)
the buttons the game tells the (79:10 - 79:14)
quote-unquote game tells you to press I (79:12 - 79:16)
like it a lot but I don't really know (79:14 - 79:18)
that it's a game you're not you're not (79:16 - 79:21)
wrong it is a game in a sense that it's (79:18 - 79:22)
a (79:21 - 79:25)
capper like shrimps we're very big I was (79:22 - 79:28)
very big shrimps for a very long time at (79:25 - 79:30)
I still playing still will and half (79:28 - 79:34)
later we'll still playing but in shrimps (79:30 - 79:35)
don't you have to make like a lot of (79:34 - 79:37)
decisions there's not really a lot of (79:35 - 79:39)
decisions to even be made and so the (79:37 - 79:43)
thing about Pritam is and most other (79:39 - 79:44)
tapper I've played a lot of tappers like (79:43 - 79:47)
eggs ink is another one that stands out (79:44 - 79:49)
to me the thing about those games is you (79:47 - 79:52)
can usually brute-force them with time (79:49 - 79:56)
Magikarp jump doesn't do anything on its (79:52 - 80:01)
own which is a little annoying in that (79:56 - 80:03)
aspect like I don't like I'm already (80:01 - 80:05)
pointing out negatives and I'm very high (80:03 - 80:08)
on this game don't get me wrong but at (80:05 - 80:11)
least in like trims you can your trims (80:08 - 80:12)
don't do anything at the start and then (80:11 - 80:14)
you hire like two trims and then you're (80:12 - 80:16)
clicking to make them do stuff and then (80:14 - 80:19)
eventually with women I say eventually I (80:16 - 80:20)
mean like the first five minutes of the (80:19 - 80:23)
game the trims are self efficient to (80:20 - 80:25)
work on their own and what you're doing (80:23 - 80:27)
at that point is is once they're (80:25 - 80:30)
bringing back resources you're hiring (80:27 - 80:33)
more trips or building more buildings or (80:30 - 80:37)
or you're spending those resources so as (80:33 - 80:39)
you spend the resources they accomplish (80:37 - 80:42)
those goals faster which gets you more (80:39 - 80:45)
trims and more resources and then that (80:42 - 80:48)
builds but you even let those games idle (80:45 - 80:51)
and get reward for it yeah but you can't (80:48 - 80:53)
do that in Magikarp jump because (80:51 - 80:55)
everything for which you get a reward (80:53 - 80:58)
requires a tap yes and just like in (80:55 - 81:01)
shrimps you well you could let it idle (80:58 - 81:04)
and eventually get to your goal I mean (81:01 - 81:06)
if you were applying for a straight day (81:04 - 81:07)
you'd probably get there but you could (81:06 - 81:09)
let it idle for like two weeks and then (81:07 - 81:11)
get there without actually clicking the (81:09 - 81:12)
thing about shrimps is you do hit a wall (81:11 - 81:16)
and you go through a portal and when you (81:12 - 81:17)
come out of that portal you're starting (81:16 - 81:19)
over sounds familiar right (81:17 - 81:21)
but you're getting some of the benefits (81:19 - 81:24)
that you did on your last run those go (81:21 - 81:27)
into your new run and it makes it easier (81:24 - 81:29)
to then get past that brick wall hit a (81:27 - 81:31)
new brick wall go through the portal (81:29 - 81:33)
come back around the same thing for eggs (81:31 - 81:34)
ink the same thing for other tappers (81:33 - 81:35)
magic (81:34 - 81:38)
Karp jump exactly like that your (81:35 - 81:40)
Magikarp can only jump so high once (81:38 - 81:43)
that's over you start over and a little (81:40 - 81:45)
bit goes into that new Magikarp and I (81:43 - 81:49)
mean there there are the the game part (81:45 - 81:52)
comes with I would say the game part (81:49 - 81:55)
comes with the the spending of okay (81:52 - 81:57)
where am I going to put my coins yeah (81:55 - 81:59)
that's true or where what am I going to (81:57 - 82:01)
buy with my diamonds which is a little (81:59 - 82:04)
more rare what decoration do I want to (82:01 - 82:06)
go in because I definitely think some (82:04 - 82:08)
decorations are way better than other (82:06 - 82:11)
decorations yeah that's true and really (82:08 - 82:12)
some of the first decorations that you (82:11 - 82:14)
can afford off the bat while you can (82:12 - 82:17)
afford them and put them down I think (82:14 - 82:19)
that you hurt yourself in the long run (82:17 - 82:22)
of like Oh instead of 150 you should (82:19 - 82:24)
have saved to 250 because this (82:22 - 82:27)
decoration will benefit you way more (82:24 - 82:29)
than the other decorations yeah and if (82:27 - 82:31)
for those maybe that are still at the (82:29 - 82:32)
beginning I think the two best (82:31 - 82:36)
decorations are the shame and planter (82:32 - 82:39)
yeah got that one and the whimsicott (82:36 - 82:43)
cushion I don't have that one yet the (82:39 - 82:45)
whimsicott cushion I think is the best (82:43 - 82:48)
one to buy first because it increases (82:45 - 82:51)
your trainer XP points by 9% that's the (82:48 - 82:53)
only thing that increases your overall (82:51 - 82:57)
trainer XP and as you know your Magikarp (82:53 - 83:01)
level is based off your trainer XP right (82:57 - 83:03)
faster you can get that up because there (83:01 - 83:04)
have been some runs where I got my (83:03 - 83:08)
trainer level up twice yeah am I on that (83:04 - 83:10)
s-s-san model though I just think it (83:08 - 83:13)
looks cool huh you guys are so much (83:10 - 83:15)
further in this game than I have gotten (83:13 - 83:17)
what race what rank are we all education (83:15 - 83:21)
yeah look I'm I'm level 3 rank 3 for (83:17 - 83:24)
your trainer yeah okay Travis what rank (83:21 - 83:26)
are you 21 (83:24 - 83:30)
I am rank 22 woo which I can see cuz I (83:26 - 83:34)
linked my leaderboard to Facebook and (83:30 - 83:36)
then had the Wall of shame thrown up in (83:34 - 83:38)
front of me yeah that's that's such a (83:36 - 83:40)
like that's such a mobile gimmick tactic (83:38 - 83:42)
of like here's what your friends are (83:40 - 83:44)
doing and it's like ah I just played (83:42 - 83:46)
here so how much better your friends are (83:44 - 83:49)
then you write as you feel (83:46 - 83:52)
bed in the morning well your last on my (83:49 - 83:55)
list just let you know yeah I believe it (83:52 - 83:57)
because I'm trainer level three and I've (83:55 - 84:00)
played this game for like a max of like (83:57 - 84:03)
an hour maybe I don't know it sounds (84:00 - 84:06)
like you don't like it though well as (84:03 - 84:08)
somebody who has you've played a lot of (84:06 - 84:10)
trims you're still playing trims cracked (84:08 - 84:13)
so I feel like this game would be in (84:10 - 84:15)
your wheelhouse this game requires far (84:13 - 84:18)
too much interaction for me trims I can (84:15 - 84:20)
let it sit on my work computer it's (84:18 - 84:21)
running on my work computer right now (84:20 - 84:24)
without me being there and you know what (84:21 - 84:26)
those little trips are making food then (84:24 - 84:27)
they're making metal and they're making (84:26 - 84:30)
wood and I had to do anything about it (84:27 - 84:33)
my grandfather magikarps just slack and (84:30 - 84:35)
he doesn't he doesn't even know how to (84:33 - 84:38)
eat unless I put the food Chomp here's (84:35 - 84:41)
uh well I think we recognize those (84:38 - 84:43)
berries it's uh is it a chest oh and uh (84:41 - 84:45)
now what's the bliz a lot of oh I mean (84:43 - 84:48)
you got you got your orange you got your (84:45 - 84:50)
oh that's right because I haven't bought (84:48 - 84:52)
the more berries I've only got the two (84:50 - 84:55)
basic berries like Oran and citrus to (84:52 - 84:56)
start and then you can buy Pecha and (84:55 - 85:00)
then eventually you get like Rostand I (84:56 - 85:02)
think oh there's a link lebas well and (85:00 - 85:04)
then a raw roster berries what I'm on I (85:02 - 85:07)
think you can get it when you're 22 we (85:04 - 85:09)
pull it up little on the list you know (85:07 - 85:10)
what I'd really like to talk about how I (85:09 - 85:12)
solo captured a Suresh seven star (85:10 - 85:14)
Sergius this morning but that's just not (85:12 - 85:16)
the topic I had no idea what that even (85:14 - 85:20)
means so good so the berries that you (85:16 - 85:21)
have access to start with Oran berry and (85:20 - 85:24)
Sitrus berry and then you can buy petra (85:21 - 85:26)
berries window berries walk and berries (85:24 - 85:28)
those are the ones that make it so that (85:26 - 85:30)
electric-type moves super-effective (85:28 - 85:33)
moves are their damages have a lepa (85:30 - 85:34)
berries (85:33 - 85:36)
Rost berries and then and that's how far (85:34 - 85:39)
I am in terms of my berry access but (85:36 - 85:42)
then you get a spare batteries batteries (85:39 - 85:43)
I don't know I said it like a human's (85:42 - 85:48)
name berry raspberry blackberry and then (85:43 - 85:50)
finally it's a lava cookie when you hit (85:48 - 85:52)
that a la streaming or t2 wouldn't the (85:50 - 85:54)
lava cookie get real soggy underwater I (85:52 - 85:58)
mean it's uh it's it's it's baked so (85:54 - 86:01)
crispy by the lava that okay you need (85:58 - 86:02)
that SOG (86:01 - 86:04)
maybe like a dunking an Oreo and milk (86:02 - 86:07)
yeah yeah but you're on a pretty strict (86:04 - 86:09)
time limit with that evening imagine (86:07 - 86:11)
your cares about the sogginess of a lava (86:09 - 86:13)
cookie probably not but you don't know (86:11 - 86:14)
about that Piplup you don't know if that (86:13 - 86:17)
Piplup stealing food you didn't get (86:14 - 86:20)
Piplup eating my food I didn't agree to (86:17 - 86:22)
this Piplup to be in my tank whoo that's (86:20 - 86:24)
a good point haven't gotten the Piplup (86:22 - 86:27)
yet I think you got a B is it the first (86:24 - 86:29)
or second tournament that gives you the (86:27 - 86:31)
Piplup I think it's the first tournament (86:29 - 86:34)
you you do I mean I've done I've done (86:31 - 86:37)
the first league okay so let me got to (86:34 - 86:38)
be the second let me let me give you a (86:37 - 86:40)
pro tip here so if you go under (86:38 - 86:41)
achievements there's a bunch of (86:40 - 86:43)
achievements for like number of times (86:41 - 86:46)
you log in times fed times trained (86:43 - 86:48)
events triggered patterns collected (86:46 - 86:51)
there's one that says social media (86:48 - 86:54)
shares okay so I'm not doing that here (86:51 - 86:57)
here's the pro tip here's the pro tip (86:54 - 86:59)
because I want to I want to get all the (86:57 - 87:00)
achievements did you make a Twitter (86:59 - 87:03)
account just for Magikarp jump shares no (87:00 - 87:06)
no I have a better way Travis I am this (87:03 - 87:12)
is breaking news no one you're hearing (87:06 - 87:14)
this first this is something I tested (87:12 - 87:16)
last night I was so excited to report on (87:14 - 87:19)
this the social media I've not seen this (87:16 - 87:22)
anywhere and and for the record I have (87:19 - 87:24)
looked up very little information on (87:22 - 87:28)
Magikarp jump because I I do like just (87:24 - 87:31)
like trips you can say that shrimps or (87:28 - 87:34)
eggs Inc are there games that play (87:31 - 87:36)
themselves right but there are still (87:34 - 87:39)
things that you don't know what happens (87:36 - 87:42)
and that like that's exciting like going (87:39 - 87:43)
through the portal for the first time (87:42 - 87:46)
and trips is like whoa I did not expect (87:43 - 87:47)
this and then getting new items and trim (87:46 - 87:49)
sub like oh I can get a mansion now I (87:47 - 87:50)
never had a mansion before like those (87:49 - 87:52)
are exciting and I think the same thing (87:50 - 87:53)
applies here too (87:52 - 87:57)
Magikarp jump of Oh something happens (87:53 - 88:00)
when bah bah bah like the first time you (87:57 - 88:02)
do one of the training events that you (88:00 - 88:03)
just unlocked it was like oh this is (88:02 - 88:05)
cool or even like I don't know what a (88:03 - 88:08)
Charizard does until I buy it or at (88:05 - 88:09)
least I think it doesn't tell you what (88:08 - 88:11)
they do yes for you yeah them it doesn't (88:09 - 88:13)
yeah that doesn't tell you what you do (88:11 - 88:16)
so I'm looking through the list you see (88:13 - 88:16)
a lot like I (88:16 - 88:18)
items use magikarps forced to retire (88:16 - 88:21)
social media shares so the first one I (88:18 - 88:23)
think you need to do three the second (88:21 - 88:27)
one you need to do 10 the third one you (88:23 - 88:30)
need to do 50 or not 20 the fourth one (88:27 - 88:32)
you need to do 50 so I'm assuming the (88:30 - 88:36)
last one is you need to do a hundred so (88:32 - 88:39)
you can tweet those to get one point (88:36 - 88:42)
now I tested if you cannot do the same (88:39 - 88:44)
event twice so if you want a gym battle (88:42 - 88:47)
you can't tweet that like four times it (88:44 - 88:50)
only works for the first one so if (88:47 - 88:51)
you're going through a gym and there's (88:50 - 88:53)
15 spots in the gym and you always lose (88:51 - 88:56)
at 16 you can do every single one of (88:53 - 88:58)
those gyms even if you've done them (88:56 - 89:01)
before as long as your Magikarp is wiped (88:58 - 89:03)
and you got a new Magikarp so that's 15 (89:01 - 89:07)
chairs but no way am i spamming either (89:03 - 89:08)
of my Twitter's Pokemon podcast or (89:07 - 89:10)
dragging a lake with it with over a (89:08 - 89:14)
hundred Magikarp notifications like I (89:10 - 89:17)
might do one a day but here's the trick (89:14 - 89:22)
you can text yourself or another person (89:17 - 89:26)
and that counts as a share what fYI I (89:22 - 89:30)
just texted both of you hahahahahahaha (89:26 - 89:33)
so Irene is going to wake up this (89:30 - 89:35)
morning and she's going to see about 20 (89:33 - 89:38)
Magikarp text from me but I tested and (89:35 - 89:40)
it counted every single time and then at (89:38 - 89:42)
that point I went I should probably stop (89:40 - 89:45)
texting her so I tested myself I texted (89:42 - 89:49)
myself and it worked so every time you (89:45 - 89:53)
do a gym battle or even a special event (89:49 - 89:56)
just text yourself that because you have (89:53 - 89:58)
to do over a hundred to complete that (89:56 - 90:01)
part of the achievements so there you go (89:58 - 90:03)
you heard it here first I was so excited (90:01 - 90:05)
when I discovered that last night I (90:03 - 90:07)
couldn't wait to podcast they will (90:05 - 90:10)
probably fix that hole soon enough well (90:07 - 90:13)
I mean texting is sharing so I don't see (90:10 - 90:15)
why it wouldn't take why that my (90:13 - 90:18)
precious Magikarp just jumped 34 meters (90:15 - 90:20)
and won hashtag Magikarp (90:18 - 90:23)
Travis you didn't play have you played (90:20 - 90:25)
any tapper prior to this I played games (90:23 - 90:27)
similar to this I played a tiny bit of (90:25 - 90:28)
tramps cookie clicker (90:27 - 90:30)
I played cookie clicker (90:28 - 90:32)
there's the one what's the is it (90:30 - 90:34)
adventure capitalist is that what that (90:32 - 90:36)
one's yeah yeah yes I games pretty all (90:34 - 90:38)
right I played a little that I didn't (90:36 - 90:40)
like that I played the more like I (90:38 - 90:42)
played them were I'm not sure I (90:40 - 90:44)
I think cookie clicker met it might have (90:42 - 90:45)
come out when I was like in high school (90:44 - 90:48)
or early college and I was a slacker so (90:45 - 90:51)
you know like some of that in class but (90:48 - 90:52)
I mean they're not (90:51 - 90:54)
they've it's never been a genre that (90:52 - 90:56)
engages me heavily (90:54 - 90:59)
but magikarp jump is cute and it has (90:56 - 91:02)
Pokemon in it so a lot of the times (90:59 - 91:03)
that's enough for me to forgive a lot of (91:02 - 91:06)
other things I wouldn't like another (91:03 - 91:08)
game so I'm playing it having a good (91:06 - 91:10)
time have you put em either of you put (91:08 - 91:13)
any money into it uh hello oh my gosh (91:10 - 91:17)
okay I have this I have this like when I (91:13 - 91:19)
like something I have zero problem (91:17 - 91:22)
giving it money and so when I logged in (91:19 - 91:24)
and I saw oh like for 72 hours I don't (91:22 - 91:26)
know if you guys saw this for 72 hours (91:24 - 91:28)
here's X amount of diamonds and a bunch (91:26 - 91:32)
of items for $4.99 and then for 72 hours (91:28 - 91:34)
because it's our special launch thing (91:32 - 91:37)
here's X amount of diamonds and some (91:34 - 91:40)
more items for $0.99 so right off the (91:37 - 91:43)
bat I was like somebody made this game (91:40 - 91:46)
and it's free and they have to get paid (91:43 - 91:49)
somehow and this is giving me item so (91:46 - 91:51)
this is my way of supporting the people (91:49 - 91:54)
who made said you let you do that for me (91:51 - 91:57)
also six dollars is cheaper than a meal (91:54 - 91:59)
at five guys so that's Jerry and (91:57 - 92:01)
everything that's cheaper than a meal at (91:59 - 92:04)
five guys your you should buy you should (92:01 - 92:06)
be buying money is no good in the bank (92:04 - 92:09)
yeah my problem is one I mean I just I (92:06 - 92:12)
don't like the game very much and - I (92:09 - 92:14)
only get paid once a month and this is (92:12 - 92:16)
what we call fifth week we're in it's (92:14 - 92:18)
the fifth week of the month since I've (92:16 - 92:20)
been paid and I'm getting hungry and (92:18 - 92:22)
it's either that meal at five guys are (92:20 - 92:25)
some Magikarp jumping maybe June will be (92:22 - 92:27)
Magikarp jumps month to make some cash (92:25 - 92:30)
off me this is a non sequitur but it's (92:27 - 92:32)
rowdy tackle is there a pun there (92:30 - 92:34)
there's a man in the game named rowdy (92:32 - 92:37)
tackle yeah and I realize tackle like (92:34 - 92:42)
tackle box rod fishing rod I am (92:37 - 92:45)
yeah the other thing I want to point out (92:42 - 92:48)
is what what it's the second it's not (92:45 - 92:50)
the sandbag it's the second one with the (92:48 - 92:53)
the counter yeah that counter is the (92:50 - 92:55)
same counter that's in pokemon stadium (92:53 - 92:59)
oh remember the minigame where you have (92:55 - 93:01)
to make Magikarp jump and whoever can (92:59 - 93:07)
hit a I didn't notice that that's cool (93:01 - 93:10)
like there's a lot of really like subtle (93:07 - 93:14)
things that I really enjoy about this (93:10 - 93:15)
game (93:14 - 93:18)
I don't maybe I'm misunderstanding the (93:15 - 93:22)
the manaphy when manaphy shows up you (93:18 - 93:24)
tap it and then it starts fever rush (93:22 - 93:27)
right and then all the love discs come (93:24 - 93:32)
and corsola yeah do you tap the love dis (93:27 - 93:34)
and corsola to get the food to drop or (93:32 - 93:37)
do you happen do you eat the food (93:34 - 93:39)
because you can only have so much food (93:37 - 93:41)
on your screen do you eat the food so (93:39 - 93:43)
when they're passing by they're dropping (93:41 - 93:46)
more food now I think food rush allows (93:43 - 93:51)
you to pass your cap of food production (93:46 - 93:54)
so you just have as many of the Pokemon (93:51 - 93:58)
as you can I think it seems like it's I (93:54 - 94:01)
always just tap the Pokemon and then eat (93:58 - 94:03)
the food that's there when I'm when it's (94:01 - 94:05)
over and I'm pretty dang sure there's (94:03 - 94:07)
more food than what there's more food (94:05 - 94:11)
than my current tanks cap would normally (94:07 - 94:14)
allow yes wildly tapping all the time (94:11 - 94:16)
tap tap tap tap tap tap tap (94:14 - 94:17)
I've never even paying attention to what (94:16 - 94:21)
I hit on I put a lot of my most of my (94:17 - 94:23)
coins are going straight into food (94:21 - 94:27)
because I'm checking so often that it's (94:23 - 94:29)
more of a payoff a fresh if you if (94:27 - 94:34)
you're checking at least twice a (94:29 - 94:37)
half-hour I would say if you're checking (94:34 - 94:42)
even once every half hour you get way (94:37 - 94:45)
more out of the food at least in my (94:42 - 94:48)
experience than you do from the training (94:45 - 94:50)
yeah if you if you check enough the (94:48 - 94:51)
other that but there are other (94:50 - 94:53)
strategies right like if you like you (94:51 - 94:55)
said if you don't check that often (94:53 - 94:56)
probably the training (94:55 - 94:58)
about our investment but then there's (94:56 - 95:01)
also the consideration of and I mean it (94:58 - 95:03)
would take someone to actually crunch (95:01 - 95:06)
the math on this but I would guess that (95:03 - 95:09)
there's also an argument to be had for (95:06 - 95:12)
buying your upgrades not necessarily for (95:09 - 95:14)
the specific thing you're buying but to (95:12 - 95:17)
just get things to rank 25 so that you (95:14 - 95:20)
get the support candy that upgrading (95:17 - 95:23)
something to that extent gets you so (95:20 - 95:25)
then your support Pokemon or butter like (95:23 - 95:27)
I think there's multiple ways to do it (95:25 - 95:29)
and I'm sure one of them is optimal but (95:27 - 95:30)
I'm not gonna bother figuring out what (95:29 - 95:33)
that is yeah yeah yeah the one thing I (95:30 - 95:35)
have that's a little outside of that is (95:33 - 95:37)
one time I did the training where it's (95:35 - 95:41)
the jump up and hit the counter and for (95:37 - 95:43)
some reason my Magikarp went absolutely (95:41 - 95:45)
wild and broke the counter and I got in (95:43 - 95:48)
2000 JP yes from one training session (95:45 - 95:52)
which is like much much more than you (95:48 - 95:54)
would at any other time yeah that's but (95:52 - 95:56)
here's the thing if you don't ever (95:54 - 95:59)
upgrade that the counter and you hit (95:56 - 96:03)
that again 2,000 JP is like nothing once (95:59 - 96:06)
you hit like level 15 or 16 like it's (96:03 - 96:10)
like I can eat one berry there are there (96:06 - 96:11)
are two berries out of the six I have (96:10 - 96:13)
that when I eat that berry it's a (96:11 - 96:17)
thousand JP or well whatever it is so (96:13 - 96:19)
that yet to answer your question well (96:17 - 96:23)
every one of the training games games (96:19 - 96:26)
who every one of the training cutscenes (96:23 - 96:28)
has one of three results the most common (96:26 - 96:30)
result is just your basic so I think the (96:28 - 96:31)
counter one is a great example because (96:30 - 96:34)
it's very easy to see the basic result (96:31 - 96:36)
for counter is you get a hundred jumps (96:34 - 96:39)
the I think it's called a good result a (96:36 - 96:42)
great result is 500 jumps and then (96:39 - 96:45)
amazing effort just all nines (96:42 - 96:48)
overflowing yes green as as you (96:45 - 96:49)
mentioned and every one of those (96:48 - 96:52)
training cutscenes has its own variation (96:49 - 96:55)
of that like the dwell or bold or pushes (96:52 - 96:57)
it's just like how far the double or (96:55 - 96:59)
bold or gets pushed and then the (96:57 - 97:02)
punching bag is punched and off the (96:59 - 97:04)
chain bit yeah (97:02 - 97:07)
that timber one you either don't really (97:04 - 97:09)
make a dent in the tree or you do that's (97:07 - 97:09)
sort of (97:09 - 97:12)
and it Awards you larger amounts of JP (97:09 - 97:14)
as you note I think you break the trade (97:12 - 97:16)
down but they I don't think I've ever (97:14 - 97:19)
got an amazing effort on timber but yeah (97:16 - 97:21)
I think the tree is broken in half (97:19 - 97:22)
couple more things I want to talk about (97:21 - 97:25)
how many shiny gold magikarps have you (97:22 - 97:30)
guys gotten zero two or three and in (97:25 - 97:31)
what generation Magikarp are you on oh (97:30 - 97:35)
let me see it's a generation 23 okay so (97:31 - 97:38)
I'm at generation 21 that's interesting (97:35 - 97:42)
because I did the I did the wind XP you (97:38 - 97:44)
did the exp thing so you're probably (97:42 - 97:45)
right that I should have bought that (97:44 - 97:49)
yeah I'm also bought diamonds so yes I (97:45 - 97:51)
was it was very easy for me to afford (97:49 - 97:53)
that pretty quickly because I think it's (97:51 - 97:55)
one of the more expensive ones have you (97:53 - 97:57)
lost one of magikarps to Pidgeot or (97:55 - 97:58)
Voltorb ah (97:57 - 98:00)
I want to say four or five that's that's (97:58 - 98:02)
what I want to talk about so I only had (98:00 - 98:05)
one gold Magikarp since then it seems (98:02 - 98:07)
that everyone in slack has gotten at (98:05 - 98:09)
least one gold Magikarp but a couple (98:07 - 98:11)
people have gotten two or three and I (98:09 - 98:13)
believe the golden Magikarp correct me (98:11 - 98:16)
if I'm wrong when you have it every time (98:13 - 98:18)
it collects coins it collects more coins (98:16 - 98:20)
yeah that's I mean each Magikarp has an (98:18 - 98:22)
individual bonus in addition to the (98:20 - 98:24)
motivation bonus that's tied to your (98:22 - 98:26)
trainers rank and the individual bonus (98:24 - 98:28)
changes depending on you know which (98:26 - 98:30)
Magikarp you have but the gold magic (98:28 - 98:32)
hearts individual bonus is always an (98:30 - 98:34)
increase in the percentage of coins that (98:32 - 98:36)
you receive yeah the most of the bonuses (98:34 - 98:39)
are like oh you get your 150 bonus for (98:36 - 98:42)
being on Magikarp number 16 or whatever (98:39 - 98:44)
but then you this Magikarp has amassed (98:42 - 98:47)
no not like ever eat even your average (98:44 - 98:49)
Magikarp has yeah in addition at the (98:47 - 98:51)
motivation that's the number below it (98:49 - 98:53)
right there are a lot of events in the (98:51 - 98:55)
game there's the event where Magikarp (98:53 - 98:56)
gets lost (98:55 - 98:59)
there's the event where Magikarp can eat (98:56 - 99:01)
the food off the tree there's the event (98:59 - 99:03)
where Magikarp sees something in the (99:01 - 99:03)
water (99:03 - 99:06)
sees a poker ball on the ground that (99:03 - 99:09)
we're tag-team battle that like always (99:06 - 99:11)
goes the same way every single time and (99:09 - 99:14)
I have again I haven't looked much up so (99:11 - 99:16)
I mostly because I'm enjoying the (99:14 - 99:19)
surprises that come to me let's talk (99:16 - 99:21)
about the tree so (99:19 - 99:24)
the tree Magikarp can jump to eat the (99:21 - 99:27)
fruit and that usually pays out pretty (99:24 - 99:31)
good JP and that event does scale with (99:27 - 99:35)
your level so if your level 20 you're (99:31 - 99:38)
going to get a ton of JP compared to (99:35 - 99:40)
when you're level 2 I mean you get a lot (99:38 - 99:43)
of JP for being level 2 but that event (99:40 - 99:46)
scales with your level you run the risk (99:43 - 99:48)
of Pidgeot taking your Magikarp and (99:46 - 99:52)
losing and start I wonder what the rate (99:48 - 99:54)
for that if maybe I just have really bad (99:52 - 99:57)
luck but it seems like more often I get (99:54 - 100:00)
the rond the deal in the Voltorb and (99:57 - 100:03)
Pidgeot events I've never I think I did (100:00 - 100:05)
I think I went for it three times with (100:03 - 100:09)
the tree always got Pidgeot or Pidgeotto (100:05 - 100:11)
I can't remember which it is and then (100:09 - 100:13)
for the Voltorb one I was just curious (100:11 - 100:15)
if it ever actually gave you coins so I (100:13 - 100:17)
just did every time it came up presuming (100:15 - 100:19)
I wasn't at my Magikarp wasn't like a (100:17 - 100:21)
super-high level and that thing exploded (100:19 - 100:26)
in my face I think like five or six five (100:21 - 100:28)
times before I actually got coins out of (100:26 - 100:32)
it Wow yeah I feel like for me all of (100:28 - 100:35)
them feel feel pretty 5050 feel pretty (100:32 - 100:36)
heads and tails will have you (100:35 - 100:39)
experienced the the pidgeotto Pidgeot (100:36 - 100:42)
event nope okay where the Voltorb event (100:39 - 100:43)
don't know what they are okay so (100:42 - 100:45)
sometimes after you finish a training (100:43 - 100:49)
session your guy will go oh Magikarp (100:45 - 100:50)
let's take the long way home and then (100:49 - 100:53)
that sparks one of these events and one (100:50 - 100:55)
I've gotten that for the like let's swim (100:53 - 100:57)
home and then it's like all the the (100:55 - 101:00)
glitters yes one okay that is not (100:57 - 101:00)
dangerous (101:00 - 101:03)
yeah the the so the glitter one will (101:00 - 101:06)
give you diamonds and the punishment is (101:03 - 101:09)
it reduces JP from you it'll say like oh (101:06 - 101:11)
you lost mm JP and it's like okay that's (101:09 - 101:15)
30 seconds of my time lost the the that (101:11 - 101:19)
ones always do it always always do that (101:15 - 101:22)
one I would say that the tree is never (101:19 - 101:25)
worth doing I don't think it's ever (101:22 - 101:27)
worth jumping for the fruit because (101:25 - 101:29)
again you can usually eat that fruit (101:27 - 101:32)
within like wait five minutes wait for (101:29 - 101:33)
your fruit to fill up in the water eat (101:32 - 101:35)
all that and that (101:33 - 101:38)
usually equals the fruit you could have (101:35 - 101:40)
got from the tree that's how I feel (101:38 - 101:42)
about it I'll have to take your word for (101:40 - 101:45)
it I will not jump for fruit in the tree (101:42 - 101:48)
the only way I would jump for fruit is (101:45 - 101:50)
if like my magic like if it's I just got (101:48 - 101:52)
the magic harp and it's a basic magic (101:50 - 101:55)
harp and it's like level 15 or something (101:52 - 101:57)
where it's like okay this is my very (101:55 - 101:59)
first day with this magic harp I ate I (101:57 - 102:01)
don't have any training or I have one (101:59 - 102:03)
training I decided that might be the (102:01 - 102:06)
only way because of its like if if my (102:03 - 102:09)
magic harp gets taken I would be back at (102:06 - 102:12)
the beginning and it's possible that I (102:09 - 102:14)
could get a better magic harp than just (102:12 - 102:16)
the basic magic harp that I was just (102:14 - 102:19)
given 30 seconds ago that would be the (102:16 - 102:22)
only reason why I would jump (102:19 - 102:25)
now the Voltorb I think the volt herbs (102:22 - 102:27)
always worth doing so what happens is (102:25 - 102:28)
like you're mad (102:27 - 102:32)
your magic harp will see a pokeball and (102:28 - 102:34)
it will say like investigate or not (102:32 - 102:35)
investigate and if you hit investigate (102:34 - 102:38)
it's like are you sure yes or no and (102:35 - 102:40)
then it could either be a volt or which (102:38 - 102:41)
will explode and kill your magic harp (102:40 - 102:43)
just like Pidgeotto takes your magic (102:41 - 102:46)
harp away or it pays out coins and (102:43 - 102:49)
usually a lot of coins and again just (102:46 - 102:51)
like the tree the coins scale with your (102:49 - 102:53)
level so when you're at level 2 you (102:51 - 102:58)
would get maybe 20 or 30 coins out of I (102:53 - 103:01)
should say your trainer level or (102:58 - 103:03)
generation level not your actual magic (103:01 - 103:07)
harp level your rank so your rank so if (103:03 - 103:10)
you're Rank 2 or generation 3 for your (103:07 - 103:12)
magic harp you might only get 20 or 30 (103:10 - 103:16)
coins but when you rank 21 generation 20 (103:12 - 103:20)
it's going to pay out like 320 coins and (103:16 - 103:24)
besides like getting 10 to 12 coins (103:20 - 103:28)
every 5 levels in the pool and getting (103:24 - 103:32)
like 15 to 16 coins per battle the 200 (103:28 - 103:35)
coins is a lot in 200 or 300 coins is (103:32 - 103:39)
kind of a lot in compared to what you (103:35 - 103:41)
normally get from just going through the (103:39 - 103:45)
game like the only way I wouldn't know I (103:41 - 103:47)
feel like I would I feel like I would (103:45 - 103:48)
always do the voltar I don't think there (103:47 - 103:50)
a situation not because the worst the (103:48 - 103:52)
worst thing that happens is you just (103:50 - 103:54)
start over and it doesn't I guess (103:52 - 103:57)
doesn't really matter but I mean like I (103:54 - 103:59)
don't think I would do it if I had been (103:57 - 104:01)
sitting on a magic art for a long time (103:59 - 104:05)
right like if it like if like I'm at a (104:01 - 104:07)
point where takes me a while to like (104:05 - 104:12)
level 31 is the cap I can get to with (104:07 - 104:13)
this magic harp and if I were like level (104:12 - 104:16)
30 and I got the Volturi event event I (104:13 - 104:18)
probably wouldn't yeah so here's my (104:16 - 104:21)
thing so I I have a generation 21 magic (104:18 - 104:23)
harp the rank I can get to is level 32 (104:21 - 104:28)
and I have two more Jim I have two more (104:23 - 104:31)
battles left to beat the great League or (104:28 - 104:32)
whatever is whatever's after the heavy (104:31 - 104:33)
League (104:32 - 104:36)
yeah grande einen I know that this level (104:33 - 104:39)
32 magic harp can beat the (104:36 - 104:41)
second-to-last trainer but I know this (104:39 - 104:43)
magic harp can't beat the 'final trainer (104:41 - 104:46)
yeah this magic harp can go one battle (104:43 - 104:50)
further but to me seeing those coins and (104:46 - 104:53)
taking that risk isn't that big of a (104:50 - 104:56)
punishment because I know my my next (104:53 - 104:58)
magic harp can beat that trainer and the (104:56 - 105:02)
next trainer anyways yeah some deep this (104:58 - 105:04)
is very high level magic heart math (105:02 - 105:05)
that's a bit beyond me (105:04 - 105:08)
I don't think the one where magic harp (105:05 - 105:11)
gets lost there's no punishment for that (105:08 - 105:12)
you can either like search as there is (105:11 - 105:14)
there no punish you can either search (105:12 - 105:16)
for magic harp or you can wait and hope (105:14 - 105:19)
that magic harp finds its way home I've (105:16 - 105:22)
done both multiple times sure if you do (105:19 - 105:23)
wait I'm pretty sure if you do wait (105:22 - 105:26)
you're always found at least every time (105:23 - 105:27)
I've done way I've always been found by (105:26 - 105:28)
mayor (105:27 - 105:31)
by the mayor I think if you search (105:28 - 105:33)
there's a chance the I haven't seen it (105:31 - 105:36)
but I imagine there's a chance you don't (105:33 - 105:37)
get found and then maybe you lose some (105:36 - 105:39)
Jake I've never lost yeah I've never (105:37 - 105:42)
lost any when I do like my search is (105:39 - 105:45)
when mayor comes no other way around (105:42 - 105:48)
yeah if you wait then the mayor comes (105:45 - 105:49)
yes if you search then Magikarp will (105:48 - 105:52)
find you find you you're the trainer (105:49 - 105:54)
yeah and I think you get more JP if (105:52 - 105:57)
Magikarp finds you cuz your guy goes (105:54 - 105:58)
like Oh magic harp so self-sufficient (105:57 - 106:02)
right but I don't know what happens in (105:58 - 106:02)
Magikarp is (106:02 - 106:04)
unable to find you as I guess what I'm (106:02 - 106:07)
saying presuming that's an option yeah (106:04 - 106:08)
I've never had that (106:07 - 106:12)
there's the event where where you can (106:08 - 106:15)
yell at Magikarp so it's like why would (106:12 - 106:18)
you do that cuz he's slacking yeah so (106:15 - 106:22)
you can yell at Magikarp or not yell (106:18 - 106:25)
sometimes when you yell you get a (106:22 - 106:28)
training point back and then sometimes (106:25 - 106:31)
when you yell Magikarp loses JP cuz he's (106:28 - 106:35)
sad and then if you don't yell you just (106:31 - 106:38)
get JP for not yelling is what I've come (106:35 - 106:42)
to yep and tag battle I don't know how (106:38 - 106:43)
that works cuz every time I do tag (106:42 - 106:46)
battle Magikarp splashes nothing happens (106:43 - 106:49)
Pikachu Thunder shocks the video to same (106:46 - 106:50)
it's the same event time it's just you (106:49 - 106:53)
get some bonus JP for watching a cut (106:50 - 106:55)
suit I would be curious if you got like (106:53 - 106:58)
that Charizard or if you got that (106:55 - 106:59)
Bulbasaur (106:58 - 107:01)
or the kind of Lytton and Litton never (106:59 - 107:04)
shows up okay all right what does Litton (107:01 - 107:07)
do the same thing that pikachu does but (107:04 - 107:08)
but with more JP and on a higher (107:07 - 107:13)
cooldown hmm oh I mean that's just in in (107:08 - 107:15)
the pond is I guess what I'm saying (107:13 - 107:18)
yet I would but lit Litton Litton has (107:15 - 107:20)
never shown up in tag battle it's okay (107:18 - 107:23)
Pikachu okay good to know (107:20 - 107:25)
uh anything else you guys want to talk (107:23 - 107:27)
about I just need to get further in this (107:25 - 107:30)
game so people please stop asking me for (107:27 - 107:33)
answers because I ain't got them uh well (107:30 - 107:35)
get that like I said get that whimsicott (107:33 - 107:38)
plush cuz I think that one as you can (107:35 - 107:40)
tell from Travis's design an arse number (107:38 - 107:43)
are the Lola as you can tell from the (107:40 - 107:45)
numbers between Travis and I the (107:43 - 107:49)
whimsicott plush clearly matters yeah (107:45 - 107:51)
there's not a difference not that that's (107:49 - 107:53)
that big of a deal right you're just (107:51 - 107:55)
you're just going through more carp (107:53 - 107:57)
right and maybe I'm going through carp (107:55 - 108:01)
more quickly than ru because cuz voltar (107:57 - 108:03)
keeps exploding because of well that too (108:01 - 108:05)
but also maybe the items that I've (108:03 - 108:07)
bought right like let me look at the (108:05 - 108:09)
other decorations I have let's compare (108:07 - 108:14)
our aquariums fish tanks I have I have (108:09 - 108:16)
design yeah I have the octillery pot I (108:14 - 108:19)
have the sign that they give you yep um (108:16 - 108:23)
and then I have the Shaymin okay planter (108:19 - 108:26)
and then I have Litton Pikachu and (108:23 - 108:29)
obviously Piplup okay so I have (108:26 - 108:32)
octillery the sign Shaymin whimsicott (108:29 - 108:37)
and the executor planter and that I've (108:32 - 108:39)
just had Pikachu on top the executor (108:37 - 108:43)
planter gives you more coins per gym (108:39 - 108:46)
battle yeah and since I knew that I (108:43 - 108:47)
would be going through from league (108:46 - 108:50)
battles yeah 12% since I knew I would be (108:47 - 108:52)
going through that great league a (108:50 - 108:55)
hundred times because I think it's yes (108:52 - 108:59)
fifteen or twenty battles that I figured (108:55 - 109:02)
that would be a payoff there yeah but (108:59 - 109:04)
you just wait on televisions and it's (109:02 - 109:05)
it's it's tough because like I made the (109:04 - 109:08)
choice to get Litton not knowing what (109:05 - 109:10)
Litton does and I and Linton finding out (109:08 - 109:11)
that Linton does the same thing as (109:10 - 109:15)
Pikachu is like okay cool but it's like (109:11 - 109:17)
I wish I hadn't I wish I had known kind (109:15 - 109:18)
of you coming would you have done (109:17 - 109:21)
something else uh I mean I I probably (109:18 - 109:24)
would have just saved up for a different (109:21 - 109:25)
Pokemon because I like having the (109:24 - 109:28)
Pokemon pals over just a decoration that (109:25 - 109:30)
sits there passively okay I think I know (109:28 - 109:32)
what Charizard does but I don't want to (109:30 - 109:35)
spoil it for people I don't I (109:32 - 109:38)
a couple complaints about the game like (109:35 - 109:40)
I like I said earlier I I adore this (109:38 - 109:42)
game it's kind of everything I want cuz (109:40 - 109:45)
I do like tapper so much I don't like (109:42 - 109:46)
that Piplup sin the water with me I (109:45 - 109:48)
don't like it either because then when (109:46 - 109:50)
manaphy comes you accidentally tap it (109:48 - 109:52)
and then it's like oh hi there it looks (109:50 - 109:55)
like you're trying to tap a Piplup well (109:52 - 109:56)
you should check the amount of trainings (109:55 - 109:58)
you got out there store it up in your (109:56 - 110:00)
sleeve because you already got the (109:58 - 110:02)
maximum so you're gonna have to hit this (110:00 - 110:04)
ok' button and by the time you've (110:02 - 110:06)
already just dismissed this message (110:04 - 110:07)
right here that I'm reading to you all (110:06 - 110:09)
the course will have gone on their merry (110:07 - 110:11)
way and you're not getting any food out (110:09 - 110:15)
of this food fever yep that is my exact (110:11 - 110:16)
complaint like I wish Piplup was more (110:15 - 110:19)
surface area or like just get out of my (110:16 - 110:20)
way (110:19 - 110:22)
also sometimes I don't want to get out (110:20 - 110:24)
of my way to floss sometimes I don't (110:22 - 110:26)
want to use your power like sometimes (110:24 - 110:28)
I've only I like sometimes I have two (110:26 - 110:29)
out of three training sessions and I (110:28 - 110:31)
want to use those other two training (110:29 - 110:34)
sessions before I use your power Piplup (110:31 - 110:36)
because it's possible that those true (110:34 - 110:37)
training sessions can get me to max (110:36 - 110:41)
level and then I can go do my great and (110:37 - 110:43)
then you get your get my Magikarp Deb (110:41 - 110:45)
come back and then you're still active (110:43 - 110:47)
because I haven't used you yet but (110:45 - 110:49)
sometimes man if he comes and I silly (110:47 - 110:51)
click you and now I wasted that training (110:49 - 110:53)
session because I know that food fever (110:51 - 110:56)
will get me to that max level and get (110:53 - 110:58)
out of my way girl triple (110:56 - 111:00)
I'm giving Piplup no candy all my (110:58 - 111:02)
Candy's going to Pikachu because I like (111:00 - 111:04)
Pikachu's power way more than pip loves (111:02 - 111:09)
power you'll probably like Litton (111:04 - 111:12)
the other complaint I have which is a (111:09 - 111:14)
kind of a minor one is this game is (111:12 - 111:19)
really slow yet is yeah like going (111:14 - 111:22)
between training sessions to like (111:19 - 111:26)
walking home to going between even gyms (111:22 - 111:28)
you've already done it has that skip (111:26 - 111:30)
feature which is great but then it shows (111:28 - 111:32)
you the record at the end and then it (111:30 - 111:34)
closes and then your trainer slowly (111:32 - 111:38)
walks the next gym it's it's kind of (111:34 - 111:40)
hard to get in and out really quickly (111:38 - 111:42)
like I can get in and out and eat that's (111:40 - 111:44)
not a problem it's once you start doing (111:42 - 111:46)
training sessions or gym battles it just (111:44 - 111:49)
feels so sluggish and it (111:46 - 111:51)
like I know my iPhone can run this game (111:49 - 111:54)
I know it's not the limitation of the (111:51 - 111:57)
hardware it's the actual software itself (111:54 - 111:59)
yeah but that's that's really my only (111:57 - 112:01)
complaint my bag mate my man complains a (111:59 - 112:04)
Piplup needs get out of my way and I (112:01 - 112:06)
just wish the menus were a little bit (112:04 - 112:09)
faster otherwise like for a Pokemon game (112:06 - 112:12)
I think it's great I played a little bit (112:09 - 112:14)
of mola mola last week like I said I was (112:12 - 112:17)
I would and even though it's a very (112:14 - 112:20)
similar game it's it's kind of like the (112:17 - 112:24)
the comparison to ingress and Pokemon go (112:20 - 112:26)
they're pretty much the same games but (112:24 - 112:28)
that Pokemon connection just makes it (112:26 - 112:31)
feel like it has so much more character (112:28 - 112:33)
so much more depth it's just really (112:31 - 112:36)
great I'm really enjoying it I feel like (112:33 - 112:38)
I will get to rank 51 which is the max (112:36 - 112:40)
rank at this point I don't feel burnt (112:38 - 112:42)
out on it even though I've probably (112:40 - 112:44)
played it I don't even know how long I (112:42 - 112:46)
played it a lot (112:44 - 112:49)
sounds like Travis has played a lot too (112:46 - 112:52)
based on yeah your rank I didn't think (112:49 - 112:54)
we'd spend 41 minutes talking about (112:52 - 112:57)
massacre flash or just magic herb jumps (112:54 - 112:59)
sorry it's really great we'll probably (112:57 - 113:00)
have more to say next week when we get (112:59 - 113:03)
in we don't need any emails correcting (113:00 - 113:07)
us that we're wrong or you're you know (113:03 - 113:10)
telling us what things are it is very (113:07 - 113:12)
clear that we could look these things up (113:10 - 113:14)
I just think that at least Travis and I (113:12 - 113:16)
who are farthest in the game we're (113:14 - 113:18)
choosing not to look things up because (113:16 - 113:19)
of the sense of surprise like Travis (113:18 - 113:21)
could easily looked up what Litton did (113:19 - 113:22)
right (113:21 - 113:25)
I could easily look up whatever but I'm (113:22 - 113:26)
at the point where I kind of want to be (113:25 - 113:28)
surprised I'm sure that will end maybe (113:26 - 113:29)
in the next week where I just want to (113:28 - 113:31)
look stuff up and min/max stuff but at (113:29 - 113:34)
this point you know no need for emails (113:31 - 113:35)
telling us what things do like I know (113:34 - 113:37)
who I know where the resources are I'm (113:35 - 113:39)
just choosing not to look at them so if (113:37 - 113:41)
we got anything wrong apologies we got a (113:39 - 113:43)
lot of emails this last week but we're (113:41 - 113:45)
running along I don't want to run (113:43 - 113:46)
terribly long so we're only going to do (113:45 - 113:50)
two or three here if you haven't right (113:46 - 113:54)
now are you ready well I'm ready if you (113:50 - 113:55)
have an email (113:54 - 114:00)
you can write to us SBJ at pkmn cast (113:55 - 114:06)
calm or you can go to Pokemon podcast (114:00 - 114:09)
calm and hit that contact button both (114:06 - 114:12)
will get to us I said we had an email (114:09 - 114:15)
about the anime so this email is from (114:12 - 114:19)
Ben from Atlanta Georgia a little bit of (114:15 - 114:22)
a long email but here we go (114:19 - 114:25)
this is says hey guys on episode 266 you (114:22 - 114:27)
discuss the quality of the Pokemon anime (114:25 - 114:29)
and whether the Sun and Moon series was (114:27 - 114:31)
better than its previous iterations not (114:29 - 114:33)
to reopen a wound but here are some I (114:31 - 114:35)
thought here are some of my thoughts and (114:33 - 114:37)
an example of how kids may feel about (114:35 - 114:41)
the show TV shows are a storytelling (114:37 - 114:45)
medium so for some for for so far a (114:41 - 114:46)
season of a show to be considered better (114:45 - 114:48)
storytelling should be part of its (114:46 - 114:51)
evaluation now the storytelling is by (114:48 - 114:52)
all accounts terrible on the show and (114:51 - 114:55)
frankly in most of the games as well to (114:52 - 114:58)
be fair Pokemon as a franchise has never (114:55 - 115:00)
been about story but more about (114:58 - 115:03)
atmosphere and atmosphere of an imagined (115:00 - 115:06)
world where people can control actions (115:03 - 115:09)
of mystical animals and bond over their (115:06 - 115:11)
shared experiences a cool premise for an (115:09 - 115:13)
entire game definitely but since the (115:11 - 115:15)
anime is missing an interactive element (115:13 - 115:17)
that the game has you need to add a lot (115:15 - 115:19)
more in the mix to be entertaining the (115:17 - 115:23)
procedural show's follow a formula they (115:19 - 115:27)
would likely they would be impossible (115:23 - 115:29)
impossibly expensive to make them if (115:27 - 115:31)
they didn't following a formula doesn't (115:29 - 115:33)
mean you should also have bad dialogue (115:31 - 115:36)
and bland characters the people who (115:33 - 115:38)
write the Pokemon haven't really (115:36 - 115:39)
ventured beyond the basic premise the (115:38 - 115:41)
games presented until they do the show (115:39 - 115:43)
will continue to be terrible however (115:41 - 115:45)
evaluating any piece of media other (115:43 - 115:48)
elements are at play so the new season (115:45 - 115:51)
is better in some facets basically sound (115:48 - 115:54)
design art style but overall it's still (115:51 - 115:57)
an absolute piece of garbage as endo (115:54 - 115:59)
little evidence sorry about that (115:57 - 116:01)
getting got a little something my throat (115:59 - 116:04)
there I was watching the first episode (116:01 - 116:05)
of the sudden moon with my (116:04 - 116:07)
brother-in-law because my wife has a (116:05 - 116:09)
blended family he is (116:07 - 116:11)
rather young at ten years old he loves (116:09 - 116:13)
Pokemon to the point where he has all (116:11 - 116:15)
the matchup types memorized watches (116:13 - 116:17)
battle videos on YouTube constantly (116:15 - 116:19)
collects and plays the card game even (116:17 - 116:21)
plays the brick bronze version of (116:19 - 116:24)
Pokemon on his phone the third-party (116:21 - 116:27)
game he watched quite a few episodes of (116:24 - 116:30)
the show so we're watching the episode I (116:27 - 116:31)
assume he loves it since the app that (116:30 - 116:33)
he's absolutely in the target (116:31 - 116:35)
demographic for the show then around 10 (116:33 - 116:36)
minutes in the episode he says I've (116:35 - 116:39)
never been so bored he's a smart kid (116:36 - 116:41)
and says funny phrases like this a lot (116:39 - 116:44)
and I figured he just needed to be (116:41 - 116:47)
coaxed to watch a little bit more and (116:44 - 116:49)
maybe he'd get it invested into the plot (116:47 - 116:51)
we watched another five minutes and he (116:49 - 116:53)
asked if we can stop watching it and (116:51 - 116:55)
gratefully oblige his request it's just (116:53 - 116:57)
one example but even somebody completely (116:55 - 117:00)
primed to a very lease sort of liked the (116:57 - 117:03)
show found it absolutely boring in (117:00 - 117:05)
closing dear God do never talk about the (117:03 - 117:08)
anime in your podcast been all I would (117:05 - 117:10)
have to say in response to this email is (117:08 - 117:13)
that child is obviously very gifted and (117:10 - 117:16)
above average intelligence for his age (117:13 - 117:19)
and that's that's all there you go (117:16 - 117:21)
are you say that's that kid dumb kids (117:19 - 117:23)
watch Pokemon yes (117:21 - 117:26)
average kids watch Pokemon I just say (117:23 - 117:29)
that I there's nothing in that email (117:26 - 117:32)
that I'd really disagree with I think (117:29 - 117:34)
that's mainly the point I was making (117:32 - 117:38)
that sure we can concede that the (117:34 - 117:40)
storyline itself hasn't improved but (117:38 - 117:45)
other aspects of the show have and that (117:40 - 117:49)
I in the because so many people jump on (117:45 - 117:52)
the Pokemon show exclusively I think (117:49 - 117:54)
it's okay for me to be a voice that says (117:52 - 117:55)
hey these other aspects of the show (117:54 - 117:58)
other than storyline have improved (117:55 - 118:01)
that's and i think i think it's it's (117:58 - 118:04)
worth saying that I only dumped on the (118:01 - 118:06)
show (118:04 - 118:08)
I don't know I think that words dump I (118:06 - 118:10)
only dumped on the show because I do (118:08 - 118:11)
want it to be better (118:10 - 118:14)
it's only going to Magikarp because it (118:11 - 118:17)
was slacking yeah I get a yell at my (118:14 - 118:19)
Magikarp everything I want the training (118:17 - 118:21)
points I'm not gonna disparage anyone (118:19 - 118:23)
who criticizes the show I just don't see (118:21 - 118:25)
that many people saying I just don't see (118:23 - 118:29)
as many people noting like how much (118:25 - 118:33)
funnier the show is in this season than (118:29 - 118:36)
it has been so I see more voices saying (118:33 - 118:38)
continuing to criticize the story and I (118:36 - 118:39)
think they're correct (118:38 - 118:41)
I don't see that many voices saying hey (118:39 - 118:43)
look the jokes had better the characters (118:41 - 118:46)
are more well drawn like Lilly's arc (118:43 - 118:48)
actually makes has she has like a (118:46 - 118:50)
character arc in the sense that she's (118:48 - 118:52)
scared of Pokemon at first and then I (118:50 - 118:54)
won't spoil what happens later but you (118:52 - 118:58)
can guess like that like there are (118:54 - 119:01)
things that happen in this season that (118:58 - 119:02)
make me happy (119:01 - 119:06)
and I haven't felt that way for previous (119:02 - 119:08)
seasons I don't see many people talking (119:06 - 119:09)
about that so I am happy to be the (119:08 - 119:11)
apologist for those aspects of the show (119:09 - 119:14)
I don't think that that's necessarily (119:11 - 119:17)
mutually exclusive with my agreeing that (119:14 - 119:19)
the storyline itself is it very (119:17 - 119:23)
interesting although I will continue to (119:19 - 119:27)
defend to some extent the formulaic or (119:23 - 119:30)
repetition type story because that's (119:27 - 119:33)
like a there's a tradition of that in (119:30 - 119:37)
kids media so I guess those are my only (119:33 - 119:38)
points so I don't really have many (119:37 - 119:41)
disagreements with this email yeah you (119:38 - 119:43)
know the thing the thing I was voicing (119:41 - 119:47)
last week was the the actual story that (119:43 - 119:51)
that goes into Pokemon and I said last (119:47 - 119:53)
week I so said in slack like kids aren't (119:51 - 119:56)
dumb kids can follow a story pretty well (119:53 - 119:59)
they're you know I was her pretty dumb (119:56 - 120:03)
let's debate that cuz they are I was (119:59 - 120:06)
eight nine years old following you know (120:03 - 120:11)
a Dragonball Z story and Kairat you know (120:06 - 120:13)
I just do it I just do a decent Vegeta (120:11 - 120:15)
and thought I should yeah I was smart (120:13 - 120:18)
enough to realize that Dragon Ball Z is (120:15 - 120:20)
nothing but filler (120:18 - 120:22)
you remember that expire episode in the (120:20 - 120:25)
Majin Buu saga that was just Goku going (120:22 - 120:27)
super saiyan 3 and his hair grows a (120:25 - 120:30)
little bit at the end where the good (120:27 - 120:32)
like 10 minutes of the episode are just (120:30 - 120:35)
like shots of like abandoned cities as (120:32 - 120:36)
like birds are flying and then you hear (120:35 - 120:40)
Goku yelling in the distance just going (120:36 - 120:40)
and my favorite episode of the show as (120:42 - 120:48)
much filler as Dragon Ball Z is they do (120:45 - 120:50)
a really good job at like at least (120:48 - 120:52)
hooking you and making you want to watch (120:50 - 120:55)
the next one that is correct (120:52 - 120:57)
so I did my home I did my homework look (120:55 - 120:59)
I'm not gonna come on the show and (120:57 - 121:00)
complain about something without (120:59 - 121:02)
experiencing it it was like the same (121:00 - 121:04)
thing from no man's sky I knew no man's (121:02 - 121:06)
sky was garbage I bought it anyways (121:04 - 121:09)
because I needed to know I needed I (121:06 - 121:11)
wasn't gonna sit there and say no man (121:09 - 121:13)
sky is garbage without playing no man's (121:11 - 121:16)
sky like I wanted to know so I watched (121:13 - 121:18)
the Matteson Pokemon anime some Sun and (121:16 - 121:22)
Moon this week and I said I said this (121:18 - 121:24)
before I enjoyed the first two episodes (121:22 - 121:26)
my main complaint was the theme song (121:24 - 121:28)
didn't really dig it you know what I've (121:26 - 121:30)
warmed up to the theme song it's growing (121:28 - 121:31)
on me (121:30 - 121:32)
I don't think it's as good as Pikachu (121:31 - 121:36)
leaving Patrat hanging dry but it has (121:32 - 121:39)
moments and to say what Travis said (121:36 - 121:42)
there's things in the show that has made (121:39 - 121:46)
them happy in aspects I totally see that (121:42 - 121:49)
when lana saved spoiler when lana saved (121:46 - 121:53)
popular pop lido from team skull that (121:49 - 121:55)
was a very heartwarming moment of like (121:53 - 121:57)
yeah Populi (121:55 - 121:59)
that's my boy pop leo sweet I like Papa (121:57 - 122:02)
Leo a lot glad Papa yo is not getting (121:59 - 122:04)
harassed by team skull that is (122:02 - 122:06)
heartwarming that's really good (122:04 - 122:09)
beware I went back rewatch that mimic (122:06 - 122:12)
mimic you episode again beware (122:09 - 122:14)
fantastic I want to see more of you (122:12 - 122:18)
we're not uh I'm not a fan of Wobbuffet (122:14 - 122:20)
Wobbuffet has had their time to shine I (122:18 - 122:23)
can agree to that sure my (122:20 - 122:25)
the other thing is I still do care about (122:23 - 122:28)
the story and my argument against Travis (122:25 - 122:32)
was yes I'm there's no denying the (122:28 - 122:33)
animation is better (122:32 - 122:37)
there's no denying the voice-acting (122:33 - 122:40)
most of it's better I wouldn't soft I (122:37 - 122:41)
can't speak to that because I haven't (122:40 - 122:44)
seen the dub Sophocles American voice (122:41 - 122:48)
actor is is one of the most nails on a (122:44 - 122:49)
chalkboard thing I've ever heard in my (122:48 - 122:50)
life (122:49 - 122:52)
I never want that character to speak (122:50 - 122:56)
rotom Dex is extremely charming there's (122:52 - 123:00)
like a point where ash goes oh man this (122:56 - 123:02)
is so awesome and Rotom Dex is like I (123:00 - 123:04)
don't know what awesome means and Kaku (123:02 - 123:06)
is like awesome means like great and (123:04 - 123:10)
Rotom Dex is like oh so awesome means (123:06 - 123:11)
great (123:10 - 123:13)
Rotom Dex is so great and then like (123:11 - 123:15)
repeats that throughout the show or he's (123:13 - 123:18)
like I'm great and it's like all right (123:15 - 123:21)
that's that's really good so I'm going (123:18 - 123:23)
to continue to watch Sonny moon I am (123:21 - 123:26)
still going to be critical about how (123:23 - 123:29)
that story is being told and if it's if (123:26 - 123:32)
it if it breaks that form I'm not saying (123:29 - 123:33)
it needs to break the formula and it (123:32 - 123:36)
needs to be an oscar-winning show but (123:33 - 123:38)
when I think because TV shows man amis (123:36 - 123:42)
not Oscars that's the I want Pokemon to (123:38 - 123:43)
be the first TV show to win an Oscar is (123:42 - 123:47)
what I'm saying moving all right my main (123:43 - 123:49)
complaint against Travis's argument was (123:47 - 123:53)
I don't like I said I don't think that (123:49 - 123:57)
in improving while it might matter I (123:53 - 123:59)
don't think approving the animation or (123:57 - 124:02)
the voice or whatever is that much of a (123:59 - 124:05)
step and I only think about that as like (124:02 - 124:07)
look at a show like Pitt my ride I'd (124:05 - 124:08)
rather not (124:07 - 124:13)
so exhibit comes exhibits easier $1,000 (124:08 - 124:17)
beter and exhibit pimps that ride and (124:13 - 124:21)
all of a sudden your car is looking good (124:17 - 124:23)
the Pokemon Sun emit a Sun a moon anime (124:21 - 124:27)
is looking good that car probably has a (124:23 - 124:31)
toaster oven in it Pokemon Sun and Moon (124:27 - 124:35)
they have toaster ovens that beware (124:31 - 124:37)
that's my toaster oven I'm glad beware (124:35 - 124:39)
has been added to the show (124:37 - 124:41)
I'm glad a toaster oven is in my car (124:39 - 124:44)
they add a bunch of subwoofers in the (124:41 - 124:47)
back of your pimped out ride Pokemon (124:44 - 124:51)
anime adds pop leo you know anytime (124:47 - 124:55)
populo says pop leo I'm down with that (124:51 - 124:59)
but at the core your car is still a (124:55 - 125:02)
junker because exhibit doesn't touch (124:59 - 125:05)
your engine so while you might have the (125:02 - 125:07)
best-looking car while the Sun and Moon (125:05 - 125:10)
anime might look really good that story (125:07 - 125:14)
the drive of that story the drive of (125:10 - 125:17)
your car is still garbage and I'll (125:14 - 125:20)
totally agree I just I just think not as (125:17 - 125:23)
many people are out there saying oh cool (125:20 - 125:26)
it has a toaster now like I don't see (125:23 - 125:29)
many people saying that so I will be (125:26 - 125:30)
that person and I think it's important (125:29 - 125:34)
that people recognize that there are (125:30 - 125:37)
those improvements even if as you say (125:34 - 125:39)
those improvements aren't core to the (125:37 - 125:41)
experience of the show I think media (125:39 - 125:44)
when we're especially (125:41 - 125:48)
visual media and like TV and movies (125:44 - 125:50)
especially are such a composite of (125:48 - 125:52)
different elements right like so many (125:50 - 125:54)
people work on them in so many different (125:52 - 125:58)
aspects like someone who is you can have (125:54 - 126:01)
a job as like the animator right and you (125:58 - 126:04)
have you can't like touch the story at (126:01 - 126:06)
all which is so different than if you (126:04 - 126:08)
were like writing a book because the one (126:06 - 126:10)
person has control over every element (126:08 - 126:13)
but we're talking about mediums that are (126:10 - 126:15)
this collaborative I still think it's (126:13 - 126:17)
very important to eat to talk about the (126:15 - 126:19)
toaster ovens and the subwoofers because (126:17 - 126:21)
there's people whose entire job is to (126:19 - 126:23)
make that subwoofer and to make that (126:21 - 126:25)
toaster oven and I don't hear many (126:23 - 126:29)
voices that are praising the work of (126:25 - 126:31)
those folks and I think that because (126:29 - 126:33)
those aspects have improved it's (126:31 - 126:35)
important that some people praise them (126:33 - 126:38)
I'm happy to be that person I am never (126:35 - 126:40)
going to look too Pokemon as being like (126:38 - 126:43)
an amazing storytelling vehicle because (126:40 - 126:46)
I get that from other things and I'd I (126:43 - 126:49)
would be stunned if Pokemon ever got to (126:46 - 126:51)
a place where I thought this is good (126:49 - 126:54)
storytelling so I'm it would be (126:51 - 126:57)
unhealthy for my soul to constantly (126:54 - 127:00)
harbor a distaste for Pokemon storylines (126:57 - 127:02)
because it's not going to change so I'm (127:00 - 127:04)
willing to praise them for the things (127:02 - 127:06)
that are changing it are improving does (127:04 - 127:08)
that make sense yeah yeah totally (127:06 - 127:10)
it could change because it's now on (127:08 - 127:12)
Cartoon Network right you mean Disney XD (127:10 - 127:16)
Disney XD yes really I pulled this email (127:12 - 127:19)
what I only pulled this email so I could (127:16 - 127:21)
make the pimp my I wanted to bring up (127:19 - 127:22)
him my ride is really I think that's a (127:21 - 127:25)
very good analogy actually no easy yes (127:22 - 127:29)
and like I said I I'm just a happy I'm (127:25 - 127:31)
happy there's a toaster oven now (127:29 - 127:34)
yeah I've seen now four or five episodes (127:31 - 127:36)
of the Sun Moon anime I actually do want (127:34 - 127:39)
to watch more I'm critical everything so (127:36 - 127:41)
uh well you know we might bring it back (127:39 - 127:44)
up in the future who knows let's just do (127:41 - 127:46)
one more email just cuz we're running so (127:44 - 127:46)
long (127:46 - 127:49)
Richard writes in from Greater (127:46 - 127:52)
Manchester UK here's a oh here's the (127:49 - 127:56)
thing do people call it the UK or do (127:52 - 127:58)
they call it Great Britain (127:56 - 128:00)
ah they certainly call it the UK (127:58 - 128:02)
depending on which part of it they're in (128:00 - 128:05)
is UK a little bit technically those (128:02 - 128:06)
uniting two different things (128:05 - 128:09)
yeah United Kingdom includes Northern (128:06 - 128:12)
Ireland Scotland Britain and Wales polka (128:09 - 128:15)
which are like like it's kind of like if (128:12 - 128:17)
you were just saying um is it ok if (128:15 - 128:20)
people call it big Wisconsin even though (128:17 - 128:23)
it's like Minnesota I say they're (128:20 - 128:26)
they're different states so the UK is (128:23 - 128:31)
like the USA and then Britain is like a (128:26 - 128:35)
state yeah no no no no no no no no no (128:31 - 128:39)
you like like why nice because I don't I (128:35 - 128:42)
don't win let's go no Britain is a (128:39 - 128:44)
country not a state of you know but I'm (128:42 - 128:46)
just saying you know like no brittle (128:44 - 128:48)
Britain is not a country Wendling I do (128:46 - 128:51)
not a country ountry England is a (128:48 - 128:52)
country so it is written (128:51 - 128:55)
great brazen is the name of the island (128:52 - 128:58)
like the geographic island of Great (128:55 - 129:01)
Britain which contains England Scotland (128:58 - 129:06)
Wales but yeah and then Ireland's over (129:01 - 129:07)
there on Ireland because they never gave (129:06 - 129:09)
that part back so like Northern Ireland (129:07 - 129:12)
or Ireland generally is not included in (129:09 - 129:13)
Great Britain which is just the island (129:12 - 129:16)
that has England Scotland and Wales so (129:13 - 129:17)
that's why you say the United Kingdom (129:16 - 129:19)
because that includes that nation's (129:17 - 129:22)
territory in Ireland specifically (129:19 - 129:24)
Northern Ireland does that make sense so (129:22 - 129:27)
if I say I might also be wrong but I (129:24 - 129:30)
think if I say if I say UK I'm kind of (129:27 - 129:34)
covered yeah yes whereas if I say (129:30 - 129:36)
England or Great Britain (129:34 - 129:38)
I might offend people that are in (129:36 - 129:40)
Ireland yeah if someone wrote in from (129:38 - 129:42)
Glasgow and you're like oh you wrote in (129:40 - 129:44)
from England they probably wouldn't be (129:42 - 129:44)
too happy (129:44 - 129:46)
I said yeah if they wrote in from (129:44 - 129:49)
Cardiff I'm a little car if I have no (129:46 - 129:51)
clue where these places are Richard (129:49 - 129:55)
right Zebedee dear SBJ and team I have (129:51 - 129:58)
I'm a new fan have been listening since (129:55 - 130:01)
January of 2017 thank you so much (129:58 - 130:04)
Richard you have made my weekly 600 mile (130:01 - 130:07)
round-trip commute to work bearable I (130:04 - 130:09)
hope it's not like 600 mile a day now he (130:07 - 130:10)
said weakly (130:09 - 130:11)
now weekly (130:10 - 130:13)
once a week that's like 100 miles a day (130:11 - 130:15)
though pure well six days a week (130:13 - 130:19)
anyways I particularly a bla bla I (130:15 - 130:21)
particularly enjoy your live streams (130:19 - 130:23)
from conventions such as packs (130:21 - 130:25)
I've also I have also started to watch (130:23 - 130:28)
Digimon again and have been told by my (130:25 - 130:30)
girlfriend that I am cheating on Pokemon (130:28 - 130:32)
however I have room in my heart for both (130:30 - 130:35)
I am a firm believer that no one is too (130:32 - 130:37)
old for Pokemon and my team should (130:35 - 130:38)
consist of the ones you love (130:37 - 130:40)
rather than strong ones this has given (130:38 - 130:43)
me fairly poor results at online (130:40 - 130:45)
competitions however I am getting better (130:43 - 130:48)
I have a few questions for you one what (130:45 - 130:51)
is your favourite digimon mine is Kabuto (130:48 - 130:53)
Iman - will you attend any events or (130:51 - 130:57)
conventions in the UK three do you have (130:53 - 130:59)
any tips for somebody new to competitive (130:57 - 131:00)
especially if I'm trying to build a team (130:59 - 131:03)
based on Pokemon I like and four have (131:00 - 131:05)
you tried a Nuzlocke playthrough of any (131:03 - 131:06)
of the games if so what are your (131:05 - 131:09)
impressions of it in closing my (131:06 - 131:11)
favourite game is heart gold my favorite (131:09 - 131:13)
Pokemon is Gengar livid with the (131:11 - 131:16)
decision to remove its levitate ability (131:13 - 131:20)
I have no favorite for an ISE team as it (131:16 - 131:22)
makes it amazing with everyone of you (131:20 - 131:24)
being so different keep going and I'll (131:22 - 131:26)
attempt to find a wet burrito to try (131:24 - 131:31)
thanks Rick Oh skip the wet burrito dude (131:26 - 131:35)
no gotta go to the beltline bar grad I (131:31 - 131:38)
was yeah there you go I've never been to (131:35 - 131:39)
the beltline bar is the thing though I (131:38 - 131:42)
don't know enough about Digimon I've (131:39 - 131:45)
seen some of the original show what's (131:42 - 131:47)
the one where it's like floaty and (131:45 - 131:50)
doesn't digivolve into like way later (131:47 - 131:52)
Patamon probably let me see if that's (131:50 - 131:54)
the one in think it looks like the (131:52 - 131:57)
Pikachu bond Patamon is one that doesn't (131:54 - 131:59)
Padma is like the last one to digivolve (131:57 - 132:02)
in the first series yeah Patamon is my (131:59 - 132:04)
favorite yeah Patamon school pad minded (132:02 - 132:07)
evolves into Angelman that's what I said (132:04 - 132:10)
yeah ah my favourite digimon hmm I (132:07 - 132:15)
really like wizard man uh oh I really I (132:10 - 132:17)
like all the dark masters a lot which is (132:15 - 132:19)
pop-up puppetmon I think it's mega seed (132:17 - 132:24)
Ramon machined Ramon and pied Amon (132:19 - 132:26)
Pied Mons kind of the the weaker of the (132:24 - 132:28)
but puppetmon is really good and (132:26 - 132:30)
puppetmon story-arc is really really (132:28 - 132:31)
good too (132:30 - 132:36)
mm I like Zoo dome on which is the (132:31 - 132:41)
ultimate form of the cocoon Mon I like a (132:36 - 132:43)
lot of Digimon wizard mine is pretty (132:41 - 132:45)
great I problem I'll right now I would (132:43 - 132:47)
say was it mom uh will you attend any (132:45 - 132:49)
events in the UK well first we got to (132:47 - 132:53)
figure out what it is yeah I don't yeah (132:49 - 132:55)
I'm surprised there's not like a pax in (132:53 - 132:58)
the UK at this point I can I can assure (132:55 - 133:02)
you that definitely not in 2017 I have I (132:58 - 133:04)
have personally never been out of out of (133:02 - 133:06)
the United States that would be a first (133:04 - 133:06)
for me (133:06 - 133:09)
but I'm not I'm not opposed to it do you (133:06 - 133:12)
know the tips yeah that would be it do (133:09 - 133:14)
you have any tips for somebody new to (133:12 - 133:17)
the VGC based on Pokemon I like we've (133:14 - 133:19)
talked about this before I'll just give (133:17 - 133:20)
my two cents Travis and will you can (133:19 - 133:23)
chime in I would look at the meta that (133:20 - 133:28)
is currently pick one or two of those (133:23 - 133:30)
Pokemon probably like the legendary is (133:28 - 133:32)
being used or you know the garchomps of (133:30 - 133:34)
the world or they are canines and then (133:32 - 133:39)
pair that with the ones you like and try (133:34 - 133:40)
to get a good flow there that way you're (133:39 - 133:42)
not completely committing to the meta (133:40 - 133:44)
but you're also using Pokemon you like (133:42 - 133:47)
yeah I would I would basically say the (133:44 - 133:49)
same thing but in the reverse direction (133:47 - 133:53)
like look at the Pokemon you're gonna (133:49 - 133:54)
you're not going to be able to be that (133:53 - 133:56)
successful with a team unless the (133:54 - 133:59)
Pokemon you happen to like are the top (133:56 - 134:02)
is it like like and less than and let (133:59 - 134:04)
the Pokemon you like are already the (134:02 - 134:05)
meta you're probably not going to be (134:04 - 134:07)
able to use a team that's just six (134:05 - 134:08)
Pokemon that you like very much (134:07 - 134:10)
unfortunate well you can but you likely (134:08 - 134:12)
won't be very successful and I've that's (134:10 - 134:16)
a sad thing to say um but unless you're (134:12 - 134:18)
like really really good that's probably (134:16 - 134:22)
just true unfortunately so what I tend (134:18 - 134:24)
to do is pick one or two of those (134:22 - 134:26)
Pokemon that already have interest may (134:24 - 134:28)
be some interesting synergy together or (134:26 - 134:30)
maybe just one that you really really (134:28 - 134:33)
like and then build a team around it (134:30 - 134:35)
that can fit within the meta so for (134:33 - 134:37)
example the team I was using for quite a (134:35 - 134:38)
while I (134:37 - 134:41)
like vanilluxe luckily vanilluxe isn't (134:38 - 134:43)
that we actually talked about it last (134:41 - 134:46)
week for Pokemon of the week um and (134:43 - 134:48)
vanilluxe isn't that bad in the meta (134:46 - 134:50)
it's not one of the most used Pokemon (134:48 - 134:53)
but it gets some usage and then try to (134:50 - 134:56)
build out from there like vanilluxe has (134:53 - 134:58)
weaknesses so like what pokemon do i (134:56 - 134:59)
need to pair it with to shore up those (134:58 - 135:02)
shore up those holes essentially and a (134:59 - 135:05)
lot of people who are running vanilluxe (135:02 - 135:07)
run it with top affinis for a variety of (135:05 - 135:09)
reasons so sort of like figure out the (135:07 - 135:11)
people that are using the Pokemon you (135:09 - 135:13)
want to use what do they use with it (135:11 - 135:15)
figure out why that's the case a good (135:13 - 135:18)
resource there are a lot of analytics (135:15 - 135:20)
websites that can tell you for people (135:18 - 135:22)
that use say you would really like um (135:20 - 135:26)
column C you really like golem although (135:22 - 135:28)
I'm yeah so you'll really like a lowland (135:26 - 135:31)
golem I use pika Linux a lot although (135:28 - 135:33)
I'm not sure if that's the best analogy (135:31 - 135:36)
see analytics website I think I mean (135:33 - 135:38)
I've had I liked Pecola decks a lot (135:36 - 135:40)
Pecola Dexcom then I would just search (135:38 - 135:44)
I'm searching under the VGC 2017 for (135:40 - 135:46)
golem here it is it's only used by point (135:44 - 135:48)
zero nine percent of teams according to (135:46 - 135:50)
their analytics but on the column on the (135:48 - 135:53)
right it shows who are their common (135:50 - 135:56)
teammates so of the people that use a (135:53 - 135:59)
lowland golem 40% of them are paired (135:56 - 136:01)
with or enguru and then if you sort of (135:59 - 136:03)
look into why people are doing that you (136:01 - 136:05)
can sort of take a Pokemon that's maybe (136:03 - 136:07)
not that great but build a team around (136:05 - 136:09)
it that does fit in with them it up meta (136:07 - 136:11)
and does have some synergy with it so (136:09 - 136:14)
does that make sense at all certainly (136:11 - 136:17)
does no I would recommend we'll have you (136:14 - 136:19)
tried another lock game playthrough of (136:17 - 136:21)
the games and if so what are your (136:19 - 136:26)
impressions Nuzlocke yeah I can't no no (136:21 - 136:29)
I literally like my brie jacks I still (136:26 - 136:34)
have I don't ever know my Pokemon do are (136:29 - 136:36)
with me forever ever ever ever but I (136:34 - 136:38)
cannot do nuts lock I feel the same way (136:36 - 136:41)
uh so my answer to that would be I have (136:38 - 136:44)
done nas locks before I've never (136:41 - 136:46)
finished them because inevitably I lose (136:44 - 136:48)
a Pokemon I really like and then I get (136:46 - 136:49)
too sad to continue so I don't really (136:48 - 136:50)
exact more (136:49 - 136:53)
there there are so many different (136:50 - 136:57)
variations of nuzlockes I you can just (136:53 - 137:01)
look at our friend Maryland that dudes (136:57 - 137:03)
running a different Nuzlocke that I've (137:01 - 137:05)
never heard of every single week you (137:03 - 137:07)
ever think about how the that (137:05 - 137:10)
terminology comes from a cartoon that (137:07 - 137:13)
drew nuzleaf as the character John Locke (137:10 - 137:16)
from the television program lost is that (137:13 - 137:17)
think about how that's how we get the (137:16 - 137:18)
work yep (137:17 - 137:20)
so yeah the first thing about that all (137:18 - 137:22)
the time yes I'm what first thing I (137:20 - 137:26)
think of when I wake up it unlock the (137:22 - 137:30)
the person who popularized that type of (137:26 - 137:35)
challenge run I drew a comic of Prague (137:30 - 137:38)
of I don't know if this what this (137:35 - 137:39)
person's pronouns are so I'll just save (137:38 - 137:41)
that like I don't know so they drew a (137:39 - 137:46)
comic at to show their progress and one (137:41 - 137:47)
of their Pokemon was a nuzleaf because (137:46 - 137:48)
it was gen3 (137:47 - 137:52)
and they always drew it as a jaw like a (137:48 - 137:55)
nuzleaf with the face of Terry O'Quinn (137:52 - 137:59)
who played John Locke in TVs law ABC's (137:55 - 138:02)
lost and and then just the entire (137:59 - 138:04)
challenge itself stared beat to become (138:02 - 138:06)
known as Nuzlocke and that's just such a (138:04 - 138:10)
weird piece of history in the Pokemon (138:06 - 138:12)
fandom that always whenever I'm reminded (138:10 - 138:19)
of it I think huh lost uh alright uh I (138:12 - 138:21)
mean if I was to do it I was luck I (138:19 - 138:24)
would probably do one in the will you (138:21 - 138:29)
stop texting me your Magikarp and and (138:24 - 138:32)
text yourself I I was accidentally like (138:29 - 138:35)
test texting wrong people because I type (138:32 - 138:37)
I was typing in Steve too fast that I (138:35 - 138:38)
was texting wrong people Magikarp stuff (138:37 - 138:41)
anyways if I was to do a Nuzlocke I (138:38 - 138:44)
would do something of like if a if a (138:41 - 138:47)
Pokemon died which means you have to (138:44 - 138:48)
remove it from your team I would give it (138:47 - 138:52)
to somebody um instead of releasing it (138:48 - 138:54)
away trade it away it's an interesting (138:52 - 138:58)
like most people are doing like most (138:55 - 139:01)
nuzlockes now our twitch / YouTube (138:58 - 139:03)
related of people want to watch (139:01 - 139:04)
nuzlockes and (139:03 - 139:06)
people wanna play nuzlockes with other (139:04 - 139:08)
people watching you know if you were (139:06 - 139:10)
playing by it if you were playing by (139:08 - 139:15)
yourself you no one's gonna care / no if (139:10 - 139:16)
you're releasing or getting rid of (139:15 - 139:19)
pokemon but if you have an audience in (139:16 - 139:22)
some aspect they care as much as you (139:19 - 139:26)
care so to be so to like trade that to (139:22 - 139:28)
something peace Miss Beakman yeah so to (139:26 - 139:30)
like get rid of somebody to somebody (139:28 - 139:32)
who's also following along like that (139:30 - 139:34)
like that memory at least lives on and (139:32 - 139:36)
you're at least following the rules of (139:34 - 139:38)
okay I'm gonna have to get rid of this (139:36 - 139:39)
Pokemon but somebody else can enjoy that (139:38 - 139:41)
and have that forever that's at least (139:39 - 139:43)
what I would do that'll wrap it up for (139:41 - 139:46)
emails we have like I said we had a lot (139:43 - 139:47)
of emails a lot of really good ones we (139:46 - 139:50)
will get to those next week I just put (139:47 - 139:52)
the interview I didn't want to run that (139:50 - 139:54)
have a show run too long keep emailing (139:52 - 139:57)
in breaking breaking news incoming I (139:54 - 140:00)
just did the Magikarp adrift event went (139:57 - 140:02)
to search for my trainer and Magikarp (140:00 - 140:04)
has not found me it ended up wandering (140:02 - 140:06)
alone and lonely until night fell (140:04 - 140:09)
Magikarp is so tuckered out that is JP (140:06 - 140:12)
went down by three point nine seven K so (140:09 - 140:14)
that's kind that it's not too bad of a (140:12 - 140:17)
um okay ative it's not like a search on (140:14 - 140:19)
magic carpet drift it's not like a (140:17 - 140:22)
Kadabra comes and steals it like (140:19 - 140:24)
Pidgeotto or something at least not for (140:22 - 140:29)
me right then yeah so SP j @p k men cast (140:24 - 140:32)
calm or pokemon podcast calm that's when (140:29 - 140:33)
that's where you can shoot over your (140:32 - 140:36)
emails travis has your pokemon of the (140:33 - 140:39)
week a move set and I will give you some (140:36 - 140:40)
fun facts about it and then we will (140:39 - 140:44)
house clean up the show so it's all you (140:40 - 140:47)
the Pokemon of the week this week is (140:44 - 140:48)
Machamp (140:47 - 140:51)
Machamp hat I'm gonna give you two move (140:48 - 140:54)
sets coming from folks from our Pokemon (140:51 - 140:57)
of the week slack channel because the (140:54 - 140:59)
ability you choose on the champ is going (140:57 - 141:02)
to have a pretty large effect on what (140:59 - 141:05)
move set you are going to end up with (141:02 - 141:07)
Machamp Stu abilities are both pretty (141:05 - 141:09)
cool one of them is no guard which is (141:07 - 141:11)
one of my favorite abilities in the game (141:09 - 141:13)
just because of how interesting it is no (141:11 - 141:16)
guard has an effect where if a pokemon (141:13 - 141:18)
with no guard is out on the field (141:16 - 141:21)
all moves it uses and all moves used (141:18 - 141:24)
against it are treated as if they are (141:21 - 141:27)
like moves like Swift where they can't (141:24 - 141:29)
miss or magical leaf moves like that (141:27 - 141:32)
that have that are guaranteed to hit not (141:29 - 141:35)
even just 100% accuracy but like even if (141:32 - 141:37)
your accuracy is lower there still (141:35 - 141:41)
guaranteed to hit there's obviously a (141:37 - 141:44)
plus and a minus to that the the - is (141:41 - 141:47)
that your opponents never going to miss (141:44 - 141:49)
when attacking your Machamp the plus is (141:47 - 141:51)
that you can build a set around moves (141:49 - 141:54)
you wouldn't normally specifically form (141:51 - 141:56)
a champ the move dynamic punch which (141:54 - 141:59)
normally only has a 50% accuracy it's a (141:56 - 142:00)
fighting move with a hundred base power (141:59 - 142:04)
50% accuracy and a 100 percent chance on (142:00 - 142:06)
hit to confuse the target but with no (142:04 - 142:08)
guard you're going to hit every time and (142:06 - 142:10)
confuse every time and deal a lot of (142:08 - 142:12)
damage the other ability is that ability (142:10 - 142:14)
that comes up I feel like a lot in (142:12 - 142:17)
Pokemon of the week which is guts guts (142:14 - 142:19)
this is an ability where your attack is (142:17 - 142:21)
going to be boosted if you are affected (142:19 - 142:24)
by a non volatile status effect so your (142:21 - 142:29)
paralysis your poison or burn and so in (142:24 - 142:32)
that case you're going to put a flame (142:29 - 142:34)
orb on there to inflict a burn on (142:32 - 142:38)
yourself so that your moves will be the (142:34 - 142:40)
power of your moves will be increased so (142:38 - 142:43)
let's go with the no guard set first (142:40 - 142:46)
this one comes to us from slack user (142:43 - 142:48)
Brandon this is Machamp with assault (142:46 - 142:50)
vest and no guard assault vest (142:48 - 142:52)
I think we've mentioned before as an (142:50 - 142:54)
item that increases your special defense (142:52 - 142:57)
if well it increases your special (142:54 - 142:58)
offense and prevents you from using (142:57 - 143:02)
moves that don't deal damage directly so (142:58 - 143:04)
your set is going to be all direct (143:02 - 143:06)
damage dealing moves the V's are going (143:04 - 143:09)
to be 252 and HP 252 and attack with (143:06 - 143:12)
your remaining 4 in defense this goes to (143:09 - 143:15)
show that you're trying to make them a (143:12 - 143:18)
champ as bulky as possible and then (143:15 - 143:21)
Brandon also recommends to team this up (143:18 - 143:23)
with Pokemon with trick room and so (143:21 - 143:25)
because of that you're going to use (143:23 - 143:27)
brave nature and put zero IVs in speed (143:25 - 143:29)
the move set is going to be dynamic (143:27 - 143:31)
punch as we mentioned because it's so (143:29 - 143:32)
great with no guard (143:31 - 143:34)
knock off just because it's one of the (143:32 - 143:37)
best moves in the game stone edge for (143:34 - 143:39)
coverage and then either bullet punch (143:37 - 143:42)
for priority or poison jab for more (143:39 - 143:45)
coverage and then Brandon recommends (143:42 - 143:47)
pairing with a porygon - or a mimic you (143:45 - 143:50)
as a user to set up trick room yep (143:47 - 143:53)
trick room is can be kind of powerful so (143:50 - 143:53)
yeah (143:53 - 143:57)
the second set slack user Steven with (143:53 - 144:00)
some assistance from select user Gabe (143:57 - 144:04)
and this is also a trick room set but (144:00 - 144:06)
this is with the ability guts using the (144:04 - 144:08)
item flame orb as I mentioned to (144:06 - 144:10)
activate that ability it's going to be (144:08 - 144:16)
252 EVs and HP and 252 in attack with (144:10 - 144:19)
the remaining 4 in special defense and (144:16 - 144:21)
then the same way you're going to do 0 (144:19 - 144:24)
speed IVs and a brave nature with the (144:21 - 144:27)
moves protect close combat knock off and (144:24 - 144:28)
either bullet punch your poison jab so (144:27 - 144:30)
actually quite similar movesets just (144:28 - 144:33)
swapping out close combat for dynamic (144:30 - 144:35)
punch and then using protect because (144:33 - 144:37)
you're not having assault vest on this (144:35 - 144:39)
set but they function kind of (144:37 - 144:41)
differently because with the dynamic (144:39 - 144:43)
punch set you're really relying on being (144:41 - 144:45)
able to confuse a lot of things whereas (144:43 - 144:47)
with the gut set you're just trying to (144:45 - 144:49)
one at Ko as many things as possible (144:47 - 144:53)
with a very strong close combat and then (144:49 - 144:55)
the the pairing recommendation is (144:53 - 144:57)
actually the same for the first set so a (144:55 - 145:00)
porygon - or a mimic you to setup trick (144:57 - 145:04)
room there you have it Machamp if you (145:00 - 145:08)
are blessed with a shiny Machamp you're (145:04 - 145:11)
gonna get a good old Teenage Mutant (145:08 - 145:14)
Ninja Turtle green instead of the I (145:11 - 145:17)
don't know blueish grey that like stone (145:14 - 145:19)
washed gray color that Machamp already (145:17 - 145:22)
is in the pokémon red and blue beta (145:19 - 145:24)
Machamp was originally known as jeux (145:22 - 145:28)
d'eau this name is accomodate corruption (145:24 - 145:31)
of Judo a fighting style the champ could (145:28 - 145:33)
be seen as a counterpart to Alakazam (145:31 - 145:35)
they are both last stage of a three part (145:33 - 145:37)
evolutionary family both were introduced (145:35 - 145:39)
in Gen 1 they will reach their final (145:37 - 145:42)
stage by trading they both have a 75% (145:39 - 145:46)
male gender ratio also al exam (145:42 - 145:48)
sells at the Special Attack step while (145:46 - 145:50)
Machamp excels at the attack set (145:48 - 145:54)
moreover the girl in our burg city will (145:50 - 145:57)
trade her Abra for a Machop who the chap (145:54 - 145:59)
can also be the counterpart to (145:57 - 146:01)
Conkeldurr or evolutionary line both of (145:59 - 146:03)
them are fighting types Pokemon who (146:01 - 146:05)
whose attack is the highest stat they (146:03 - 146:08)
both have below average speed they both (146:05 - 146:10)
share the same base stat total they have (146:08 - 146:14)
the same gender ratio they both have 3 (146:10 - 146:16)
evolutionary stages they both reach (146:14 - 146:18)
their respective final evolutionary (146:16 - 146:20)
stage through trading it's fun to know (146:18 - 146:23)
Machamp 2 is seems to be based on a (146:20 - 146:26)
bodybuilder or a wrestler let me correct (146:23 - 146:28)
you boba pedia clearly Machamp is a (146:26 - 146:31)
wrestler look at the title around its (146:28 - 146:31)
waist (146:31 - 146:34)
come on exactly but don't uh don't like (146:31 - 146:37)
bodybuilder weightlifting champions also (146:34 - 146:39)
have really big belts they win trophies (146:37 - 146:44)
mmm not not belts / titles seeing as it (146:39 - 146:47)
has more than two arms and blue skin (146:44 - 146:49)
Machamp might also be based on a Hindu (146:47 - 146:54)
god perhaps Shiva or Vishnu Vishnu (146:49 - 146:58)
Vishnu Vishnu I would say the champs a (146:54 - 147:01)
wrestler the Shiva and Vishnu connection (146:58 - 147:04)
seems like a stretch to me ah isn't (147:01 - 147:06)
cheapo like an ice goddess definitely is (147:04 - 147:09)
in final fantasy a place that lets yet (147:06 - 147:11)
know her depiction in final minutes down (147:09 - 147:14)
that path VII is the destroyer Wow he (147:11 - 147:16)
destroys the final an exact tell you (147:14 - 147:20)
that she was not Shiva isn't uh like (147:16 - 147:24)
there's so much depth there it's you (147:20 - 147:26)
can't even scratch the surface so don't (147:24 - 147:29)
even try yeah okay (147:26 - 147:30)
that's that's that's that is that is (147:29 - 147:34)
very strong westernization and sort of a (147:30 - 147:37)
generalization of a principle that is is (147:34 - 147:40)
much more deeper than then we have time (147:37 - 147:44)
to go into true um and a lot of deities (147:40 - 147:46)
in Hinduism are represented with (147:44 - 147:47)
multiple arms but that's just to show (147:46 - 147:50)
different aspects of their what they (147:47 - 147:54)
represent in a single you know it's it's (147:50 - 147:55)
a it's a what-do-you-call-it (147:54 - 147:59)
trick that you use in art that you you (147:55 - 148:00)
know it's just function it doesn't mean (147:59 - 148:02)
that they actually think of the deities (148:00 - 148:05)
as having multiple arms hmm all right (148:02 - 148:07)
I'll take your word for it let's do some (148:05 - 148:11)
