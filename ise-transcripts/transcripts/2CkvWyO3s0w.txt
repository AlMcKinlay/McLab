[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the four what episode is this 400 453 453rd episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective and look i lost track at 4 50. uh i'm here you stopped caring after 40's what you said you had your height of popularity later like i'm out that's it no one cares about 500 they only care about 450 i guess i'm your host sbj will here with me i am prepared to once again launch intense internet drama over the most meaningless factors of human life once again but i do have a food challenge for steve this week oh oh are we saving that for later i was gonna let greg go first okay greg greg is here i am here i'm starting a new podcast a loop hero podcast uh there will only be one episode you will it will be deleted from your feed after you listen to it and then a week later the exact same episode will be starting oh fun interesting sounds like time travel i'm sure somebody's actually already done that right what you are still my idea i'm adding you to the lawsuit the hero is such a good game though i am is it a place it is it is a huh it's really hard to classify it is a rogue-like game but not really out i'm out it's a deck builder it's more of a deck builder oh but i love deck builders but like roguelike once you've decided to leave your loop you only keep x amount of what you discovered in that loop and then you can build new decks with what you unlock it's hard to really compartmentalize but i love that game so much so it's card-based programming where you are programming the actions of your character to survive in an environment yes okay sort of you're i have so many games to play yeah i know but look this one hooked me and it's really really good and and the graphics are really cute if i ever finish puzzle quest remind me to add game provides infinite joy so that's that's a hard one okay food challenge for steve the food challenge welcome to it's super food challenge we are going to the fantastic restaurant in eagan minnesota called bay leaf indian cuisine which has an extensive and delicious menu what do you order when you go for indian food um i've been to indian food restaurants [Laughter] that's never happened i i i'm pretty sure i know what the answer is but i'm eager to see if i'm right you could you could get a a chat i would like a chat a vindaloo a tikka masala a tandoori maybe some delicious biryani i i apologize for my ignorance i when i was at twitchcon uh i got roped into going to a restaurant where i i was not familiar with the menu and you had to sit on the floor on pillows and then you washed your hands they like washed your hands in front and then there was supposed to be belly dancing and again i'm not sure what kind of restaurant this was and that didn't happen like they didn't do it on friday or i'm not sure if we went on friday or saturday but they were like oh we do those on sundays or something like that and uh i'm not sure what i ordered but i didn't love it i want to say there was rice involved and there was chicken involved which is probably what i would order at an indian restaurant i would say point me to whatever chicken because every restaurant has chicken um i mean it's extensive when you're having non-vegetarian indian food yes i would say that most likely he got a chicken biryani yeah but probably would have also potentially gotten a tandoori chicken because there's not a lot of spices it's just it's just grilled chicken with indian spices on it really it is the most safe entry into indian food i i can see steve as a tandoori chicken yeah a little shout out if if the uh the fine owners of bay leaf indian cuisine and egan are listening uh could could you add a little more spice to the medium spicy because i got nothing off that i i don't want to have to go to full hot [Laughter] you got to keep some spice at home so you can i mean spice it up yourself just so the next time you go for indian food steve because when you move out here we're going for indian at least once a month um the the biryani is the fried rice of indian food i mean which is i mean you're good you're you're starting internet drama with that one so you're on your own i'm not even gonna try to correct it i'm just gonna be like greg what's your what's your go-to for indian food uh so it depends on how rice based i'm feeling uh so if i really just want a rice just i'm going to get uh biryani uh i will get uh i usually will get a korma i like kormas a lot um a vindaloo if i'm feeling i'm feeling it but usually i'm a cormo i'm usually into the korma i yeah i usually myself just roll the dice and anything that i can get with either goat or lamb that's that's what i'm gonna go for yeah i mean i often go chicken but like if i have a lot if i've eaten a lot of chicken then i will branch out into a wide variety whatever's on the menu really like that sounds good uh there's a really good place that does a buffet that um sadly we have not been able to do said buffet all right we're taking steve there uh but i will say this last sunday prior to this recording we ordered a bunch of food from them and created our own buffet in our house we ordered way too much food uh set it all out of the counter and pretended we were at a restaurant well speaking of pretending we got some pokemon news and to pretend no more greg this has been a bad 25 year the news is slow and dumb no no this is the perfect transition to pretend no more following me no deantha has been added to pokemon map well i get it i get it now and i understand this is the biggest news of the past like two years right masters has been around for two years uh they just celebrated one point five one one and a half okay uh we're gonna start we're gonna start off with the pokemon master news this is off pocketgamer.com uh pokemon masters ex latest update welcomes champion iris with high dragon uh tapasio and alongside the duos they can expect another event battle which is the impending kalos champion deanthe and gardevoir which will um when is when is she she's supposed to arrive on the 31st i think yeah the banner is not up yet and i've been saving my gems to pull onset banner yes iris is available now who cares i okay i have recently gotten into regularly playing a gotcha game it is pokemon answers gunshin impact okay so i have begun to start to understand some of these terms that you guys use because there are banners in denture impact and it's like because it shows you a little rectangle and it's like if you do this one these are the things you won't get you will not get them there is a minor chance you'll get them and it's minor at best well and then like venti is promoted and it's like i keep pulling on that one i don't understand why it's called pulling because i'm not pulling anything but buying that banner um it's pulling like a physical card game term like you're pulling from a pack oh that's true yeah i mean i think the slot machine you're pulling oh man oh you're right you're pulling it out that's impossible but i had now that you say that because i bought two packs of uh i bought three packs of adventure time yesterday i didn't get any good pulls right now that's well how much money have you put in the uh ginger impact zero greg how much money did you put in against an impact zero uh i didn't play for very long because the controls bothered me like oh i was playing on the ipad and it was just like 100 secret get yourself an xbox controller pair it to your ipad play it through the xbox controller it's a whole other okay but fantastic experience that is putting money into the game you're buying an xbox controller use that xbox controller for other stuff i never finished my question you could use a playstation controller too true true he also doesn't have one of those um why why are there like 30 different currency things 400 hey masters only has two and they named them exactly the same yeah i mean masters is the worst by far but what's the point so i mean in general the point is mostly it's one currency is is paid and one you can get for free and then depending on the game the currencies will break down to what you can pull in game from the banner based on that well that's all right okay so genji impacted right it has like these two kinds of fates or whatever yep and it's like some banners you get with uh intertwined faint and some banners you can get with the acquaint fate and you have to like do different things to get the two different can i just why so masters has what's called a fair scout banner which is what iris is under right now and all that means so normally a banner in masters is a seven percent chance of getting a five star and when it's fair scout it's a ten percent chance of getting a five star and if you they change this at the year anniversary if you do a 10-pole you get a bonus 11th poll which greg and i speculated that we weren't sure they were gonna keep back in the day and they did decide to keep it which was nice they did because they did not guarantee a four star because their pull system is still pretty garbage but at least if you pull ted there's now at least a reason to pull 10 whereas there just wasn't any reason to pull attend before um iris is a five-star tech sync pair and it has access to breaking swipe which lowers the opponent's attack uh snarl which lowers the pokemon's special attack and then hydrogen's sync move which is triple threat dragon rush which does more damage based on how many how much the target's stats have been lowered i've been told that iris is good um and iris is really good if you also have blue with blastoise because uh blastoise is very bulky and defensive and iris lowers everything so you live forever is the is the pairing i i would assume that people would want to probably save for deantha and gardevoir is that just because diana has been on the loading screen for since day one and it's now a year and a half later is the best champion well i mean iris was also a great champion spoiler champion but not the best champion oh that's like my favorite story that's ever come from this podcast is when you were getting black and white too and you were in the checkout line and irene picked up the guide and like scrolled through it and you saw that iris was the champion as a spoiler that was like the one pokemon the one pokemon game i tried to like not look at any spoilers for and it really hit me in the butt at this point i just look at all the spoilers now i'm not safe anyways um there's also so the the the other hype around diana is there's not a lot of fairy type attackers no in the game um and so dianth has also been uh speculated i'm sure data mined at this point that she's going to be the best fairy type attacker but we'll we'll wait till she arrives yeah because like xerneas is just a tank it will keep it just stays alive that thing rex house so in competitive pokemon where what category does fairy type typically fall into in like vgc sure oh it's it's up there it's very very good so the reason why is it like is it like uh is it a a tank more of a tanky is it more of a support is it more of uh what does they call adp is that is that a term is it more of a more changing um well there was there was togekiss in the early seasons of vgc which was uh just critical hit non-stop and it either critical hit either flying type moves or fairy type moves and then early vgc there was sylveon which was an attacker the dominant fairy right now is probably tapu finney which i would say is more support um it would be like setting up misty terrain it would be like uh usually call mind and getting health back it would be i was just thinking like when people talk about pokemon types and like one of the things i may get the words wrong but i think that i frequently hear is people are like ice type is a very defensive type right so nice type was a very fragile type what i would say ice types were more world glass cannons okay so what would fairy type be um fairy tape is just well-rounded i would say okay i would say i would say well-rounded i will i'll have to pull up my i did a spreadsheet once because i was going to make an rpg once uh a mystery dungeon rpg to be effect and i took the average stats of every of that type where it was the primary type and did a spreadsheet to find out which in which average to always be higher and i don't remember what it came out to be but i have it i have i have the spreadsheet one day i will finish my mystery dungeon rpg and in mystery dungeon of uh what pokemon masters in pokemon masters do you have duel types yes yes okay so gardevoir can be psychic fairy yes but the only part we actually care about is the fairy part because psychics overdone well it depends what the moves are and uh what how how garter bar is going to be built because you only get four moves one is usually one there's always one that's at least like the i will increase or i will do something because of the bond between me and my trainer so it usually has like a fancy name like like your main character with pikachu has jumpstart which makes you go faster uh somebody has is it professor oak that's like dreams come true or something yeah something like that yeah where are you like you hit that instead of actually doing a move so it depends on how many moves they actually make very how many moves next like champion time or whatever yeah well but steve just said we need a good fairy attacker and pokemon masters and you're assuming that gardevar is going to be an attack based i think i think when they added iris the anthem was in the data mine i guess that's not a big secrets that's not official how dare you but yeah i think uh speaking of hacking yes speaking of hacking uh pokemon zoroark the masters of illusions is on pokemon tv i love that movie i am watching that two nights it is available until april 2nd free to watch what what level of hot dog cart is in this where would where would we rank zoroark masters of illusion number one best pokemon movie ever oh wait wait let me let me rephrase i left out some words number one best pokemon movie ever that also features celebi there's a lot of celebrity in a lot of pokemon movies as this is the best one about any of the pokemon i will say i will say zoroark masters of illusion better than power of us oh well everything's better than power of us uh i will say that zoroac master positions in the top five top five power yeah power of us is literally the worst movie um i think i would put at the bottom of my list too it's just i would probably say that the zoroark movie is not as good as the genesect movie the general movie is pretty alright yeah i think that things are works better than the dynastic movie it is definitely not as bad as the location movie but canadian is pretty pretty down oh yeah yeah this is better than that okay that one's garbage well candy on might be second worst movie i don't know i choose you is in there no it's pretty alright that's a good movie i saw that movie in hawaii i will never forget seeing i choose you in theaters and then like the whole theater was very well behaved you know you didn't have anyone talking or anyone screaming um and as soon as the credits were over i just remember this this like redneck dad standing up going i still don't get it are they all pikachu [Music] i mean i do remember seeing in the film in the theater because we were in the back and there was maybe 10 people total in the theater uh and during the one part almost everybody laughed so oh yeah yeah yeah that's one of those situations i find where it's like if people have heard about a movie and then it's like they hear everybody says oh well this part is going to happen and then they feel like they have to laugh even if they didn't really feel it in their heart to laugh at that point in time because i certainly didn't laugh uh i was more confused like the second day and people hadn't been talking about it and people still laughed so i'm glad that that part wasn't spoiled for me um i kind of wish it was fine for me because it's been long we could talk about it right it's been long enough no you can't get there okay what five years four years oh no when did i choose you come out hold on oh i was i was in hawaii so it was five years anniversary 20th anniversary right no 2017 the 2017 film pokemon the movie i choose you well if somebody's man that seems like a very long time ago they have not seen it by now because they're six years old yeah they're waiting for six year olds listening to an audio podcast of three 30 plus year olds arguing about we are about to get a thousand emails the kindergarten grasses spoiler alert for i choose you stop listening at this point if you do not want to know skipping my second point in that film what am i the one that's supposed to say what happened yes you are you are the the person that brought up the spoilage so you are the spoiler so near the end of the movie uh a bunch of pokemon hyper beam ash into oblivion is it a bunch of pokemon or just one pokemon it's like the like queen yeah it was like it was like the bunch of pokemon and then um ash wakes up and then pikachu explains why the entire time through their journey they never went like pikachu talks which is the part where everyone laughs at and says like the reason i didn't go into my pokeball is because i wanted to be with you outside the pokeball and for any of our uh really diligent listeners i mentioned this like two weeks ago and so people laughed and made fun of it because i guess maybe they didn't understand what happened which was no i think a lot of people didn't understand what happened honestly no like i disagree like ash dies right ash dies which which a lot of people didn't get they just thought he got blown up because he gets electrocuted in like every anime he dies he dies he like pikachu just doesn't suddenly doesn't talk it's like the afterlife i compared a lot to when harry sees his like self when voldemort does the thing i don't that he was resurrected at that point it's not in his look i don't remember that harry potter that well but there's a weird part that's very similar to the end of harry potter ash wasn't dead when that part happened what what the pikachu yeah yes he was because it hadn't hit yet it hadn't hit yet because ash was like getting the ball getting the ball you'll be safe if you're getting the ball no he he gets hit he gets hit and then pikachu talks we're gonna have to i'll contact my netflix dvd subscription and then we'll see and then because ho-oh is there and ho is the resurrection pokemon ho brings ash back to life that is actually what happens but it happened so fast that i i think people just were like oh pikachu just straight up talked for like five seconds the problem is is that the majority of the people in this world have zero imagination and couldn't postulate anything as a answer to the question of why is pikachu talking other than he could talk the entire time and was just choosing not to say anything okay being weakened by martial on the other pokemon ash tells pikachu to get in his pokeball but pikachu refuses because he always wants to stay by ash's side however ash finally forces him into his pokeball as pokemon attacks ash causing his body to disappear yes see in despair but he said i want to be by your side before the attacks hit yes really yes yes i don't know i'm going to watch that i see it right here in the thing i just said it to you i still think that it's uh more that like it was like a the power of the connection between ash and pikachu allowed them in this very intense moment to have why are we looking for a logical answer i'm a cartoon i stand by the fact that moment came too early that moment would have worked after death resurrection and coming back and they had much more time to sort of be in the after effects than right in the middle of all that and it felt weird it felt weird where it was placed and that is still why people laughed because i i i don't disagree it definitely was like weird i get what they were going for though like they had to like but it would have been more effective post everything else post all of it and it would it would have it wouldn't have cut the tension so weirdly and it wouldn't have felt so out of place people laughed and i always say like well people have different reactions like if one third of your audience laughs one-third doesn't understand what happened and one-third is like into it your moment didn't land correctly you didn't you didn't set it up properly yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you gotta get 80 of the people that is my biggest issue with when that happens it's not weird that people laughed at it because like i said i i get why people laughed at it it's it it is weird though when you think about the first pokemon movie where like pokemon literally cried and the tears that floated into the air yeah brought ash back to life like that is also pretty weird but i think that moment no no no no tears have amazing resurrection tears have powers that people at hospitals are always crying the the reason why that worked is because the tension was at its breaking point and everybody needed that release the reason why this didn't work is because we were in the middle of the tension and they broke it at the wrong time they broke the sense of tension that everybody had was something that was so out of place that also the phrase itself didn't match up to what pikachu had been doing when they hadn't met like you weren't friends and you didn't want to get in the pokeball then so saying i wasn't wanting to get into the pokeball this entire time is because we were good friends when the first half of the movie was you becoming friends made that whole the whole thing felt weird and it came at the wrong time if it had come after post death then it would have been much more sense why did you not go in the ball that line would have hit you now we're both dead at least one of us could have survived also when the first pokemon movie came out in 1990 whatever uh [Music] we we did not know at that point in time how often well that yeah ash is fundamentally immortal and can never be destroyed he is like matter energy and ash in this universe he converted one to the other but you can never destroy do you think do you think that scene ruined that movie i don't think so i think no i think it's like i don't think anyone was like oh that movie sucks because of that scene i think people just no i think i have i have many other reasons why that why i was not a fan of that movie that is just that is the one that people point to i would argue that the structure of a lot of the film uh fails uh i still like as much as i criticized the movie i still think it was a good movie um but there were a number of things that i felt were fundamentally wrong with that film and i still think they're not as good as this movie no but it still thinks there aren't better man i don't i will say probably bottom of the barrel worst pokemon movie is definitely the uh reshiram zekron movie that is so oh so bad is that the one with the giant organ at the end that's the one where golurk flies for the first time and yeah that one's awesome no which is the one that has the giant musical organ or pipe or we should just turn this podcast into continual reviews of the very few pokemon movies that exist because we always go down this hole no there are like 23 pokemon movies yeah there are 453 episodes of this program where we continually review 23 pokemon movies okay we'll have one final special episode where we all have to watch all 23 movies and then rate them in a row no breaks that is a five hour podcast right there when we're all in the same location we'll all set aside a week exist at the same spot and torture ourselves watching all 23 movies uh all right there was some new pokemon center merchandise added there was a kitchen collection added oh no that butter dish is sweet and you know it no no no no they added a ceramic utensil holder a ceramic treat jar i don't know why they just didn't call it a cookie jar it's literally what it is no because you can put cookies anymore you can put dog treats in it it's not just for cookies i guess uh ceramic mixing bowls i'm not i'm not one to hang out in the kitchen too often do people want ceramic bowls or do i thought they wanted like plastic or glass or nobody wants plastic plastic is the wrap seems like power of us of kitchen materials but if you drop ceramic it breaks right well that's what makes it so precious yeah oh if you drop plastic it bounces okay people do not give value based on drop ability yeah but if it was stainless steel it would also it would dent but it would still be good i mean once again determine value by bouncibility all of the materials behave differently and are used for different reasons but as a collection they made the molotow ceramic ah there's they said like everything else is ceramic it's it'll be weird to be like here's five ceramic pieces for your kitchen set and these three are plastic oh really probably be cheaper if they're plastic pikachu ceramic baking dishes a pikachu ceramic pie dish and a pikachu ceramic serving plate and then they they released pikachu ceramic salt and pepper shakers which i ordered oh you did i did already but did you get the most important one i oh i don't know a pikachu the last one is the pikachu kitchen ceramic butter dish this gives me so many issues it just gives me i i mean obviously i was moved to the point of texting you both and saying why does this exist this should not exist i mean why should it not exist because i do like about 2021 no don't put butter on the table yes yes where are you supposed to put it keep it in the refrigerator to be used as an ingredient not a condiment butter is not a condiment i can i can get i can see the taste and the discord messages you know how many negative reviews we've had okay i hate butter so you can send your hate mail to me however i live in a butter loving home who does already have a butter dish out and i did send this text to my husband should i get this as our new butter dish and the response was yes question mark which is not a definitive answer so i have not purchased the butter dish i will say my for my background and reasoning behind this number one i grew up in a tupperware house where the majority of the stuff was plastic thank you everything okay i cannot stand tupperware number two what is wrong with tupperware farts there was always a butter dish on the table and that thing because it perpetually had a stick of butter in it was never cleaned oh so it just has like years worth of butter residue in there because like butter doesn't go bad yeah but obviously kind of but also okay butter is an ingredient in things not on things look as somebody who doesn't spend a lot of time in the kitchen there's very few things i know how to make one of them is toast and by putting two pieces of bread into a toaster and then having access to not solid butter yeah it is if we remove the butter from the counter then that's one less thing i can keep your butter in the refrigerator we have we have the butter as the person that will make toast and not put butter on it what are you putting on your toast hold on a little what are you putting on your toast if it's not butter peanut butter jelly butter jelly or nothing like cream cheese oh you know what's real good bread i do how dare you look at me with this shot look try this i say i want the pure taste of toasted bread unaltered by your strange outside influence no but here i got i got i i've got key for you and for anybody who's like spent their life just like under the strong arm of big dairy butter holding you down yeah this is what you got to do because cows deserve a better life get yourself some ricotta cheese when you make your toast you spread that ricotta cheese on the toast get one of those like coarse salt grinders grind yourself some coarse sea salt on top of that ricotta cheese and just a little sprinkle of pepper little tiniest sprinkle of pepper that is the best way to have toast i'm not on board with ricotta cheese i think like i don't like so i don't like cream i'm very picky about my cheese textures i don't like cream cheese because i hate the sourness uh and i'm trying to remember if i've had ricotta cheese recently enough to say i would do that and that's don't be flavorless i okay so okay i'm living my pokemon life right we can if you're watching on youtube you can see a bunch of pokemon stuff behind me it's for the most part stays to my office uh and we have pokemon stuff throughout the house right like we have like a pokemon blanket uh like a throw blanket on our bed uh in the in the kitchen we have like the pokemon apron in the living room we have like one or two pokemon plushies that we like rotate out every now and then so i i have pokemon sprinkled throughout the house and there's a good balance i think sometimes people have way too much of something you ever walk into somebody's kitchen and they like have a theme going on and you're like and then they walk into the bathroom and they have a whole nother theme going on yes my parents are like terrier decoration and the no like not into that any like not into like the rooster bathroom that my parents have were like look if your room doesn't have a theme how do you know what to do in there that's true that's true but uh so i like i like a little subtlety you know so i i felt like the pikachu butter dish was like too much but the salt and pepper shakers were like cute like cute enough no no so but see the thing is now like if you're gonna go in you gotta go in at least in a set right it's like if i'm gonna have the pikachu salt and pepper shakers on the table and i'm going to have a butter dish because i live in greg's house then i might as well have the pikachu butter dish all right okay go ahead i was gonna say the the thing like out of all these items that i would buy would be the pikachu pie dish yeah because it's like this is good if i'm gonna make a pie let me make a cute pie for you this is my worry and maybe the maybe the cost should make me feel better but i don't think so i got the moo moo milk collection it was remember that two plates and then two bottles i think there's actually a bottle behind me um and i kept one sealed right and put it next to my ancient mew gotta let it appreciate in value so i can pay for my kids college and then i use the other one as like hey we're actually gonna use the i mean they're plate like their plates right like let's use them as like little plates and that design is no longer on the plate was this a pokemon center yes it was the little it was the mill tank with the blue lines and the red circle around it and was it ceramic i'm not sure if they were it wasn't plastic not i don't think they were plastic all right i have a fundamental question you have you have pikachu [Music] salt and pepper shakers in your house do you know which one you are supposed to put the pepper in um i figured it would probably tell you no there's no mercenaries there's no s p there is one clue and i am testing you yeah because any of us from the 70s we know this answer oh wait okay so to describe because this is an audio podcast uh for most people there's a pikachu with both eyes open and then there's a pikachu with one eye winking winky winky i would assume that the winking one is the salt incorrect no incorrect what would you make your judgment based on what how do you make your choice because it's thinking at you that you're being unhealthy by having no no no no no no no there is like every shaker out there is marked by this so that you know which one's the salt and which one's the pepper what is this it's the number of holes on top number one no i can't see the number of holes in this picture you can you can't you can't just one of the pictures look at the uh last picture oh the last picture yeah the pepper always has more holes yep you failed you're you're i thought we were going off the eyes i thought you were saying like if we had like uh like like a woody woodpecker salt shaker one woody woodpecker would be winking and one would not take these particular i had mentioned i was you guys you guys sold it as like the 70s there was always like one salt shaker winking at you and one nut no there was in the 70s always the one that had the most hole at the top we were literally taught this in elementary school so we didn't fill our shakers incorrectly but talking about incorrectly inappropriate it now that you have forced me to look at the images of these items on pokemon center store dot com dot com dot org why did they have to feature how you fill the salt and pepper shaker why did that have to be an image that will never leave my brain ever it's a little pikachu booty there like certainly it is little pikachu booty to get you going i have the cookie jar seems all right the cookie jar looks cute the utensil holder is a waste of space are we going to talk about the new parade scam yeah yeah yeah we could talk about that scam this would be the last thing we talked about before we go to break there is a pokemon celebration parade grand marshall pikachu uh figure if you can't if you want to picture what it looks like imagine a arcanine with a pikachu riding it and uh a eevee leading it both pikachu and evie have a top hat arcanine is carrying a pikachu banner it is purchase limit two it has not sold out yet as it's been up for a week now uh uh it says here they come the pokemon celebration parade is on our way to commemorate 25 years of pokemon this detailed figure features some cheerful pokemon marching in uniform grand marshal pikachu leads the parade with its silver and blue outfit arcanine is giving pikachu a ride like a parade float and evie walks ahead smiling as his friends and smiling at its friends and fans joining the fun of the celebration of past present and future pokemon combined all the figures to make a full pokemon celebration parade other figures sold separately protective pads at the bottom help keep this piece steady on most smooth surfaces each figure is hand painted to highlight the details of the scene natural variations in paint may occur a pokemon center original it's made out of resin not ceramic the country of origin is china it is four and a half by nine by six inches and they said there are more they didn't say how many more and they didn't show what the other ones look like but it's that you're gonna have a parade of pokemon throughout the year look i don't know i'm strangely attracted to this thing and i hate like every one of these figurines that they've ever made and yet strangely looking at this one i kind of want it i just know it's going to be as bad as the train set it's going to feel cheap they didn't even say how many there are the train said they at least said there was four well this isn't limited quantity this is limited purchase oh oh oh oh oh you were saying number of uh participants in the parade yeah hmm they're really good they they must have figured out that this just works they like oh yeah they did the the pikachu one which i which i did which was the the 12 pikachus with funko and i actually greg you got some of those didn't you no you didn't get oh i think they're great quality they're awesome like i didn't get any of the funkos i also don't really like funko they're i did get the train and i hated the train quality yeah the the pikachu funkos when they did that for whatever year that was they did a different pikachu every it's not the funkos with the big black eyes because funko makes toys they they make other things besides the big but they're really really great and i got all of them and i think they were 16 each and they came out once every month and i got the wholesale collection and then they did the train the train was forty dollars there was four of them and i got the first one and it was bad and i was like i'm not i can't if it was good quality i would have paid 40 every month or not every month whenever they released it then they did another set of four trains this past year and i don't know they sold out like instantly or something because i don't remember them ever being up on the website but there were like two people in our slack that said they got the trains um and then they did the eevee stuff which was also through funko um where they did the 12 evs 12. no that was like nine ten something like that there was not twelve ev evolutions no yeah they yeah they had one for every each they were like and then they did the four uh haunted houses which were bad quality because they were the same as the train and i don't know how i feel about this it looks like it's better than the train and better than the haunted houses but not as good as the funko but also more expensive the train looked good on the one picture they did but if you zoom in on these pictures you can see the same issues i had with the train which is there it just painted usually the paint is bad like if you look at in their promo picture the transition of pikachu's feet to the saddle that he's wearing like already the paint looks bad there yeah it's like the second picture and same with the back oh and his little shirt and tie that's not so great they just they always just like you expect a level of crispness in these products that you aren't getting because they are hand painted you can get better painters or just let a machine do it better just let a machine do it and say it's hand painted as long as it looks good i don't care i don't know attempted i don't like the ground they're walking on i think it looks well it looks like a pebbled street yeah it does look like yeah you can see a little confetti on it which kind of looks cool yeah it just looks like the the demarcations between the cobblestones look like rivers of tartany and i'm not into that maybe arkanis is a little hot a little hot melting the melting the cobblestone in the air the asphalt i feel like i would be almost more willing to okay so this is this is my thought process if they showed all five let's say there's five of them and they showed all five and the other four are cooler than this i would then feel in in uh i would then feel like i would need to buy this even though i don't love this because i want to complete the set yeah but now my worry is what if the second one has like chimecho and cramer ant and aromatees everyone's three favorite pokemon this one sells out and then you can you can you can't get the second one now because you didn't get the first one and now it's like i don't have a leader of the parade i got an aromatise here and it's like what's happening like i don't know well maybe maybe aromatisse is the head of your parade maybe you showed up late maybe maybe you should be happy with the ones that you get and not worry about being a completionist well with the eevee and with the pikachu funko stuff they they didn't show all of them but they at least showed like silhouettes so you at least knew how many there were you could at least kind of guess what's happening with this parade the parade will last as long as the money holds up [Applause] [Laughter] they're like we got the start of the parade done we got the end of the train then if it keeps selling we'll keep making the middle of the parade the middle is just like schroedinger's parade until you look at it you don't know what's gonna happen i it's not forty dollars it's 30. it's 30. it's also not a house i'm kind of mad that the pokemon magikarp fitted tank top is already sold out yeah i was going to send that to you too but it sold out so that's so fast and it's super cute although i i don't know who gave the art direction to the model's faces the model that may haven't make the faces in these pictures because they are oh you know that's stock photography and they just cut and paste the clothes onto them [Laughter] do you think our great grandparents had these kinds of discussions about yeah nothing else to do i just posted a link to a yadro uh porcelain dragon like chinese style dragon which would be you know comparable to the pikachu leader of the porcelain dragon costs 29 645 this thing is gorgeous is it hand painted though oh i i mean it's got to be designed man-made how's the paint quality on that greg it's amazing also it's porcelain so i mean this thing is incredible now that i've been watching the great pottery throwdown i understand how hard it is to make these things all right let's take a break real quick when we come back we got some uh pokemon go news and some bug news so we will be right back [Music] [Applause] this is the year of miraculous some could argue that 2019 is the year of practice [Music] [Music] and we are back uh we got some pokemon go news uh we this is a off pokemon go live.com celebrate the festival of colors in india with pokemon go

black one with a color explosion and then there's a white one with a different color explosion which i feel i feel like i've seen these designs before like unlike eyestock photo that you pay for for 40 bucks but maybe maybe they're unique i'm not sure they look like i've seen them before i mean they're fireworks and a cloud like yeah how much you're gonna do what are you so creative i guess what do you what do you expect i mean they're nice i think i would i like the black one quite a bit um i think this is cool for india it's cool that they get their own event i'm sure plenty of trainers around the world complain that you know go fest was in chicago and they can't travel to go fest and blah blah so it's cool that they got their own event there was the um mexican event a little bit ago uh i'm sure germany will eventually get their safari zone or whatever probably later this year it seems likely we were talking on the break about how pax is announcing dates for conventions and gen con is announcing dates it's probably very likely that in yeah in weeks or months that niantic will start doing their hey we're doing events they're all outdoor we're limiting the amount of people we have hand santana's sand sanitizations everywhere i am i'm sure niantic will probably uh say something sooner rather than later honestly which i feel like i would rather do a niantic outdoor event than to go to a convention inside a building i think this year i am still with you on that yes as i just as a preference for how my events are handled yes yeah i mean as a preference but i'm really eager to get back to seeing people so yeah you know i i got i got i am prepping for it i'm prepping to be inside i got my things going on i got you know uh the other thing here pokemon go related is niantic updated the all-in-one 151 master research pokestop task that was a mouthful um so after you complete the catch 30 of every type and catch for 31 days in a row which i think some people are still on it's like step two i believe i'm still on the first step yeah uh the third step which was the one revealed earlier so this is a whole conversation and it's kind of taken us a while to get to talking about it but when they announced the kanto tour that we did the three of us safely well safe as we could be at mall of america um i'm so happy i got a hotel room that we were able to grab food eat in the hotel room not near anyone yeah that was a good call so they announced the the kanto tour it was 12 right or 11 anyways uh and then there it was the 12-hour event it was the there was worries prior to this of what if i can't catch all 151 i won't be able to get mew that wasn't the case which i assured people the way they worded it was the mew quest was going to be separate um you got a shiny ditto you got 12 hours of stuff you got the tray you have whatever you got all the rewards and then there are some people that only wanted the shiny mew they spent the 12.99 and then they were very upset that they had to work for the shiny me i mean we talked about this at length we talked about this and the biggest thing that people were definitely upset about was you had to be level 40 to get the shiny mu which is still the case it is the third step and i on this program the positive beacon i am the negative one yeah said level four is the last thing you have to worry about because because at the time we didn't know the other steps but there are the other steps are there's a lot there's a lot to them there's a lot so i would argue that catching 30 dragon times is way harder than getting to level 40 right now uh there so the first the first task i don't remember it that well but it was like uh i'm still on it oh yeah yeah yeah let's go let's go through all the time yeah i'm still on number one it was uh make 151 great throws which i've got 79. you could do that if you're a hardcore player you could do that in a day technically uh 751 gifts which i mean you technically would have to do that in two days if you're a hardcore player because the game only limits you of sending a hundred gifts a day yes i've completed that one and when you guys left after mall of america um i walked around the mall empty because the mall closes at nine but you can be in it until 10. so i walked around the mall like three times and i was able to send like 50 gifts that night um to like get a little head start on that so it was send 150 gifts 150 great throws what were the other two 151 151 great throws i can't see it because i already oh the other one was uh complete your poke was completely canto pokedex pokedex which i didn't have until the canter tour right but that wasn't exactly right that wasn't no you didn't have to do it without 12 hours i mean it caught them so it was just me being lazy i never got a poly breath and i never got a vile poop i just never did it so i just finally did it yeah and then step two was catch a pokemon 30 days in a row so there was a 30 day minimum to even get shiny mankind if you missed a day you would have to start over and then it was catch 30 of every single type and as of right now i have completed all of that except i am missing i need 25 more dragons and it's been 30 days for me uh i need uh 19 more dark type and i need 17 more ferry which i kind of slept on ferry there was at one point there was jigglypuff's non-sp spawning non-stop and i was like ah that's i don't have to worry about that but now i'm not seeing any fairies so if i okay do double duel types count as yeah i mean they're cruel but they're not evil and so then after that you would have to get to level 40 you would have to walk 151 kilometers easily done you would have to um don't walk that much you would have to uh what was the other one you have to get to level 40 walk 151 kilometers spin 151 unique stops unique stops which they changed oh yeah and now it's just you have to spend 151 poke stops yep but i don't think the 151 the 151 unique stock stops would definitely be a problem for people who live not in a city because you would have to travel for it yeah so the question that i had before they changed it was could you have visited that stop before like does it just happen that was the question because because i have visited i could i could maybe get to 151 unique stops i mean they've really cut down victory road but i've visited all of those before so if they didn't count i was gonna be up a creek road trip to saint cloud yeah let's go to let's go to duluth for the weekend hey i still haven't been i'll go yeah let's go to the aquarium um so let's get to yeah and so they changed it to just spin 151 stops which yeah i guess you could do that in like a day or if you lived in a big city or you need to travel to a big city you could probably do that in a day but i don't know if you can walk 151 kilometers in a day well does yeah easily no we talked about this i think you said you'd do like what you said you'd do like 40 kilometers a week now i do about 80 a week okay 40 kilometers i do 40 kilometers in a day come on now uh yeah i mean i i don't know i personally didn't have a problem with shiny mu being behind the level 40. but i also feel like everything this mew quest is asking for is is for like a hardcore player oh definitely oh absolutely it's it's shiny mew this is like the impossible pokemon it should be an achievement for hard work well done yes yeah i mean i i agree i'm gonna complete it in like five years so i just don't interact with the game that much yeah i'm sure i'm sure that will be a drag i like i am i'm sure if if the game told me it was windy it's actually windy right now and i turned on an incense and i probably played for the next 12 hours i'm sure because of his windy which makes dragon type spawn because of an incense and because i'm actively playing i'm sure i could probably make a dent in my dragon stuff yeah but also i mean i will say like this this quest does not entice me to because of the length that i know is going to take so long to get to i am not more enticed to play the game more often or more than i do now like yeah i don't think there's a problem with like i just you know you'll eventually get there i eventually get it yeah i'll eventually get there just like i eventually got to 40 and suffered through december like there should be a balance between time limited quest where you're like okay i gotta go out this this sunday evening because the quest is ending and i know i can do it i just gotta set aside two hours and that's fine but i um i guess um the the other side of the coin here is i'm glad that this quest doesn't feel like i need to like do it asap yeah there's no there's no rush because it feels like it feels like a marathon like the things they're asking for feel like a marathon yeah and it and if you're not 40 by the time you get through most of this quest you'll probably be 40. we can only hope and there's enough events where like if you're missing dragon or you're missing ice or you don't have enough experience like right now if you're getting what like bonus xp on raids if you do raids and you can do one free ride a day um so if if you're missing like ice pokemon i'm sure there will be some sort of fire and ice event of air apparently have they announced the next community today no they have not yet uh final bit of news here is uh researchers named newly discovered insects after legendary pokemon this is off to kotaku this was sent in by our slack community um let me just give credits to who sent that in that was james sent that in and then stephen also provided some insight here uh they provided some some a lot of science stuff that i don't know uh but if you guys didn't hear two intimal entomologists close close uh decided to name it ologists they study m m's uh they discovered a new species of australian beetles and they named them after articuno multrace and zapdos i'm gonna ruin this it is been burum yeah i think that's close yeah so that sounds right to me ben burham articuno the ben burham multrace and the bin burum zapdos is it still the thing if you discover is it like when you discover like a comet you get to name it you discover a bug you get to name it yes generally yeah if you if you discover it you get to name it okay it is the general rule i i think there might be some limits but generally if you found it you name it okay uh in the world of scientific research those who do the hard work of delivering new findings get to name it and in the case of eastern new mexico university and at entomology and australian national university phd student yun hasio that meant immortalizing their beatles discoveries using the names of three of the pokemon's most famous powerful birds well nerds why didn't they name them after pokemon's famous powerful beatles yeah why isn't it cast cooned how is it caterpie beetle what is wrong with you a heracross okay what other beetles do we have oh oh remove you from this program there's not a beer sure it is it is or beetle okay all right it's gotta name it dude i mean one could throw genesect in there true uh quote the choice of the name for a new species is not trivial it must be different than other described species pollock said one way to ensure this is to make a name that no one would happen to come up with before except for the pokemon company you're right you went on and say yun says that he was an aspiring pokemon trainer when he was young and so because of the rarity of specimen of the three new species he suggested we name him after the three legendary bird pokemon naturally i thought it was a great ideal and so the new species which were unveiled to the world in 2020 are burburum articuno multrace and zeptos all with hacio and pollock as the authors we already planned to describe more new species of the genus that have turned up since we finished the paper and perhaps with more pokemon names perhaps next ones will be anti-raiku and sweet the legendary dogs uh i mean the bugs are i mean they're bugs they're bugs yeah looking at the bugs and like they sure are bugs they're not exciting to look at i mean they're kind of exciting to look at well there are people who are into bugs i mean i mean i sort of get like the i think the coloring is very cool like i can see a little bit why they picked the name for each of them because like the articuno has the like the bluish eyes and the bluish head and like the moltres one is much more golden than the zapdos has more like it's got only go on top and you kind of see the gold through the wings like i kind of see why they picked the names for them but they sure are bugs greg give us our question of the week all right hold on just for will taking a big time yeah still offended but go right ahead i see you looking in slack looking for what to ask osbj what's the question of the week don't know what song it was it must be like a show tune or something i don't know that one for the worst hercules oh i should do hercules uh this is from robert in our slack will there be a significance to the 1000th pokemon yes next question isn't every pokemon significant it's gonna be the millennial pokemon it's gonna have a pokemon that's got tick tock and a phone in his hand and it's gonna have a bad attitude they kind of made a digimon kind of like that actually did they really yeah i'm still mad at you for not telling about rosamund rosemond yeah somebody needed to tell me nobody did i thought it ended at lilymon no there was nothing cool about digimon keeps going keep going keep going oh well the digimon card game looks so good no no no no no axe no but they got the digimon card game has like ladies in it too i know you like that in the vanguard look no and i have been paying attention to digimon tcg which i believe is either the fifth or sixth digimon tcg to come out a lot which also i mean if you want to go down this road we can talk about the fact that the current release is version 1.5 which was i believe delayed because they can't figure out how they actually want to release this horrible horrible game they also released it and like banned the card right now that's bad uh uh how many versions does cole own oh no coal is getting into the new digimon the cars i mean okay let me see if i can get this as like short as possible because i could literally talk for hours on this particular topic but it's like vanguard players yes because the company that makes vanguard and new japan pro wrestling same company has been playing games with us for a couple of years now are always like i'm i'm quitting i'm moving to a better card game yu-gi-oh players that's been since the life of yu-gi-oh they're always looking for something better than yu-gi-oh because yukio is bottom of the barrel so now it's like when digimon the latest digimon tcg was announced last year they were everybody was like well vanguard is is junk and yugioh is junk so i'm going to digimon because that's going to be a great game and they're going to support it and they're going to make it blah but no and it has turned out to be just like every other digimon tcg that has ever been made a hot pile of trash plus anything with digimon on it is garbage oh my gosh i hate digimon i love i hate it i hate it they're the champion i hate the i watched the digimon i watched several seasons of the digimon cartoon do not like you didn't get heights when they started digivolving and they did the did no did you mind it's good i don't understand why those small children were abducted to another universe no it was the digital world it was the digital world that is also aka another universe i made i used to i used to have digimon based nicknames for my old dog okay it was a thing irene and i irene actually mentioned this the other day to me she was like they must be close to a thousand and i was like yes they're at 898 pokemon which the actual i think more interesting question is are they going to get to a thousand so add 102 pokemon in generation nine or are they going to milk it and only do like 30 50 and then would they hold the thousands up to the 30th anniversary yeah yeah i bet they hold it till gen 10. i probably i bet they go i actually bet they go 99999 999 for gen 9. and then the 1000th will be the first introduce introducing pokemon of gen 10. that would be mine the only way that they would do that is if they do it in the same way that they did with victini i bet they would teeny was pokemon zero in the you know pokemon pokedex i bet they do i mean that doesn't matter it's gonna be mythical right like it's going to be a mythical bulk yeah it's not going to be a starter because those things are garbage yeah um yeah i would assume it would be mythical like victini but the victini thing was really confusing back in the day because they made it a big deal that it was zero yeah but it it wasn't it's like victini's pokedex number is like what like 586 or something it's just it's zero in the unova decks which isn't really that big of a deal but it was the first time that a mythical would be before the stars before the starters number one and number two it was i believe the first time that you could obtain the mythical like at the beginning of the game you needed i think just two badges but yes as opposed to having to wait until the game was over for a distribution victini's actual pokedex number is 494. it's a good highway but yeah i i personally think they they save the 494 is garbage yeah from bloomington to eagan how exciting is that i was waiting welcome to minneapolis highway cast we're here in slow 485 literally rang on the highway systems [Laughter] hey do you think they put a lot of thought into like the does japan have meme numbers yeah yeah yeah 1000 is important to everybody yeah but i mean they have important numbers like like every culture has important significant numbers like 666 which you would argue is like a number everyone knows the number they played up in digimon as well so they have to that's the it's the wrong number fyi um but they they played up 666 in digimon but uh 666 obviously like devil uh or bad wrong number uh but that's vivian yeah yes the devil bad the devil the devil 777 which i would assume japan would also consider be lucky because they got slot machines there right no no that's just us they don't i don't think seven is the same american lucky number yeah seven's a very western seven seven seven ended up being together which maybe they planned that no no it's a pikachu clone they love them they love 150. they love 150 and 151 i mean seven is important in chinese numerology i think i think seven is a lucky number in china and in america maybe i i bet they save a thousand for gen 10 though i i bet they said they're going to have another region they're going to do this thing where they do the form so they'll be like they'll introduce 150 pokemon but 60 of them are new forms so that it's technically not getting yeah a thousand which is like so garbage together it would be like a podcast holding off numbering their episodes in a specific way to avoid hitting a major milestone it's that level of garbage um wasn't certain shield just like 16 new pokemon and then it was like 20 gallerian yeah how many i mean there's no i don't i don't i'm not a pokemon entomologist here i don't know right right right right these creatures in their forms are the pokemon of the week ologist yes which it's time for you ready for that yeah that was my transition that was smooth last week's pokemon which somebody somebody guessed something and it was like you realize that doesn't fly the key clues were that it has a universe all of its own um you can never meet it unless you have other pokemon in your party uh in unova i like to reference the dream radar because i made extensive use of that for completing my pokedex which was a fun weird 3ds only type thing yes so also one of the pokemon that you can encounter if you're flying around above hoen because there were those random encounters of only flying things that you could come across uh ultra space wilds from alola now you can get it in a dynamax adventure which would really make you think that it's a legendary or uh ultra beast and then i said it's immune to normal fighting and ground which really made it difficult for some people i also said it's sometimes immune to normal fighting and ground which would mean it's not always immune to normal fighting and ground but either ways and then i said some pokemon make use of a mostly light-colored modeled with black and brown globular item that might be given to you apocryphally by striat and city gym leaders alternate forms to swap their attack and defense stats to translate that into common english uh some pokemon use the grizzius orb to which could be given to you by i don't remember who the three bad guys was i knew it last week but i don't remember the shadow triad which some people argued were the striatum city gym leaders yes they are the deep lore and bad fan theory you use the grizziest orb to change the form of what pokemon it's groupie oh a good nice it's giratina look they were people that was my reference it's our beetle yeah they should have named the beatles karupi it's fun it's more fun to say than articuno except skarupi is a scorpion not a beetle not a beetle it has scorpions aren't even insects it has it can sting you i have an abdomen but beetles don't sting they pinch you can pinch and sting at the same time you've got to have a stinger beetles don't have stingers let me say it this way most beetles don't have stingers i can't speak for all beetles because i believe actually out of all creatures on this earth there are actually more beetles than any other type of creature out there but still you made it too easy by saying the orb should have left the orbs i didn't say orb i said globular item yeah globular item uh origin form giratina is the tallest generation four pokemon guarana has many differences from the other members of the trio it is the uh it's the only member with a form uh it is the only member without double resistance it has the highest hp stat rather than special attack it does not have a time space orb in diamond and pearl but it has the the other orb in platinum grizziest grizzius it is met at level 70 in diamond and pearl while the other ones were met at 47. this is reversed in platinum uh it is separated by the other members in the group by the in the pokedex by heatran and reggie giggis this is not new i think kiram was also separated um out what that actually mean this is some really dumb pokemon trivia but what that literally means is like in the pokedex like articuno zapdos and mole trace are all next to each other um but like russia ram zekram and kiram are not next to each other because kiram has like two pokemon in between it's the same for dialga palkia and yeah but kobalian varisian and turakian are all nice yeah they are all nice but keldio's not next to them ah ha ha cause kelio came later uh guarantee killed where do we rank the kelvium we cannot we already did we are we are going to do a week-long 23 movie marathon save save it for them okay guarantina is tied with lunala dawn wings necrozma shadow rider calorics of having the highest base stat total of all ghost type pokemon giratino's tied with driftblim of having the highest hp based out of all ghost type pokemon giratina in pokemon platinum giratina is the only pokemon to come out of above the screen with this trivia's out of control yeah this is very this is why hey this this trivia is more than most of the rest of the page uh in pokemon platinum when in the distortion world it does not have a shadow unless it uses a shadow force or breaks out of a pokeball um giratina is the only legendary pokemon that can be obtained in all five generation four core series handheld games well there you go all five okay that would that would be diamond platinum pearl park gold soul silver yes in pokemon heart gold soul silver the second frame jeez jeez the second frame of guarantina's altered form sprite was changed but the static sprite remained the same uh in pokemon platinum when encountering in the distortion world the unique message this distortion world's giratina appeared is displayed however it is still uh considered a wild pokemon in black 2 white 2 in the battle between legendary pokemon fantina has origin form giratina without the gracious orb altered form guaranteeing as the heaviest ghost type pokemon origin form giratina is the tallest ghost type pokemon that's there you go that's a lot how's that shiny it's good but the shiny is sweet the two shuffle icons because it does have two are both very good although i would argue altered form is much more like hey hey we're gonna play we're gonna play and uh origin form is definitely judging you real hard hot take the distortion world is not great it's like three bad rock puzzles and then you're done uh okay most pokemon puzzles most people aren't being like man i love the ice path and getting our gold soul silver which is like let's here question of the week we might have to save this for next week but which is the worst pokemon puzzle out there and i'll give you the answer the thing where you had to use the two types of bikes to get around oh the sky pillar that one's pretty bad i don't have yeah that one's pretty bad dexterity and control sorry worse puzzle the geratina puzzle is so easy though i mean what are we defining as worse like hardest to get past poorly designed just easy i like the ice puzzles i like them a lot like i like that i like was it i like the ice puzzles that you slide and you have to like figure out how to slide right because you have no momentum and i like the ice puzzles where when you step on it it cracks so you can't double step on it i'm a fan of or what about teleport puzzles which gym head those are bad was it are you thinking wolf rick yeah wolf rick well fricks is good with the spinny yeah those i would consider those like mechanical puzzles because you have to like hit a button to change things that's yes yes like claire's gym and heart gold soul silver also one of those where you have to like step on a button to rotate it and then step on a butt another button to make it go left or right all right this week's pokemon okay this is not going to be any fun for greg unfortunately anyone who follows me on snapchat will know the answer to this week's pokemon already but do you know why i am shiny hunting that's pokemon i haven't seen you send me a thing out okay fine you gotta go look at my story and whatever with the announcement of pokemon brilliant diamond and pokemon shining pearl i have decided to begin creating a shiny sinnoh regional pokedex as is widely known i prefer to generate my shiny pokemon the old-fashioned way through breeding at the pokemon nursery in the wild area unfortunately decisions made at the highest levels within the pokemon organization have impacted my ability to accomplish this from sinnoh pokemon number one to twig it turns out only one pokemon evolution line in regional pokedex order before a pokemon evolution line that had been available in an older game appears can be bred using my preferred method even worse if i had started this endeavor prior to june 17 2020 i would have had to begin with magikarp all right well that has been our episode thank you for listening uh this is our last week for our nintendo switch light giveaway i think it ends on the 26th of march if i'm not correct where this podcast comes out on the 22nd i mean it's your contest you can pick and choose whenever you want that's true um so if you want if you're interested in winning a nintendo switch uh the details are on my pin on twitter at pkmencast or they'll be in the show notes of the podcast completely free to enter and stuff like that uh i am continuing my heart gold soul silver nuzlocke we are on our way to the elite four and uh the plan is to beat the elite for this week so if you are watching on if you are interested in watching the end of that or just hanging out on twitch twitch.tv pkmencast same for instagram same for youtube same for uh tiktok pkmncast i did put out a video on friday talking about if shinies actually matter for games and just the thought process behind that so like a sample would be like people that are like oh if this game doesn't have shine this game didn't do well because it didn't have shinies or um i would be interested in this game if it did have shinies but we can point at games that do exist like pokemon masters which didn't launch with shinies but they added chinese so the question is if you were one of those people saying those two statements did you run out and play pokemon masters when they added chinese the answer you probably didn't um so i did like a 10 minute video on that if you're interested in that conversation on youtube um and i think that's it i think that's our show greg is at white wing on twitter will is at wash in the sink on twitter i'm at dragging a lake we will be back next week this has been another episode of the pokemon podcast and we are super effective super golden crips are one of the best cereals we're going to bring it back hold it chris can't get enough of them super golden crisps [Music] you
