am prepared to once again launch (0:54 - 1:00)
intense internet drama over the most (0:58 - 1:03)
meaningless (1:00 - 1:06)
factors of human life once again but (1:03 - 1:08)
i do have a food challenge for steve (1:06 - 1:11)

gonna let greg go first okay (1:15 - 1:20)
greg greg is here i am here i'm starting (1:17 - 1:21)
a new podcast (1:20 - 1:24)
a loop hero podcast uh there will only (1:21 - 1:26)
be one episode (1:24 - 1:28)
you will it will be deleted from your (1:26 - 1:29)
feed after you listen to it and then a (1:28 - 1:31)
week later the exact same episode will (1:29 - 1:33)
be starting oh fun (1:31 - 1:35)
interesting sounds like time travel i'm (1:33 - 1:36)
sure somebody's actually already done (1:35 - 1:39)
that right (1:36 - 1:42)
what you are still my idea (1:39 - 1:45)
i'm adding you to the lawsuit the hero (1:42 - 1:47)
is such a good game though i am (1:45 - 1:51)
is it a place it is it is (1:47 - 1:54)
a huh (1:51 - 1:57)
it's really hard to classify it is a (1:54 - 1:58)
rogue-like (1:57 - 2:00)
game but not really out i'm out it's a (1:58 - 2:01)
deck (2:00 - 2:04)
builder it's more of a deck builder (2:01 - 2:07)
oh but i love deck builders but like (2:04 - 2:08)
roguelike (2:07 - 2:10)
once you've decided to leave your loop (2:08 - 2:11)
you only (2:10 - 2:14)
keep x amount of what you discovered in (2:11 - 2:15)
that loop (2:14 - 2:17)
and then you can build new decks with (2:15 - 2:18)
what you unlock (2:17 - 2:22)
it's hard to really compartmentalize but (2:18 - 2:23)
i love that game (2:22 - 2:26)
so much so it's card-based programming (2:23 - 2:29)
where you are programming the actions of (2:26 - 2:30)
your character to survive (2:29 - 2:33)
in an environment yes okay (2:30 - 2:37)
sort of you're (2:33 - 2:39)
i have so many games to play yeah i know (2:37 - 2:40)
but (2:39 - 2:43)
look this one hooked me and it's really (2:40 - 2:44)
really good and (2:43 - 2:46)
and the graphics are really cute if i (2:44 - 2:48)
ever finish puzzle quest remind me (2:46 - 2:50)
to add (2:48 - 2:50)
game provides infinite joy so that's (2:51 - 2:56)
that's a hard one okay food challenge (2:54 - 2:57)
for steve the food challenge welcome to (2:56 - 2:59)
it's super food (2:57 - 3:03)
challenge we are going to the fantastic (2:59 - 3:06)
restaurant in eagan minnesota called (3:03 - 3:09)
bay leaf indian cuisine which has an (3:06 - 3:10)
extensive (3:09 - 3:14)
and delicious menu what do you (3:10 - 3:18)
order when you go for indian food um (3:14 - 3:20)
i've been to indian food restaurants (3:18 - 3:24)
[Laughter] (3:20 - 3:27)
that's never happened i i i'm pretty (3:24 - 3:29)
sure i know what the answer is but i'm (3:27 - 3:31)
eager to see if i'm right you could you (3:29 - 3:34)
could get a a chat i would like a chat (3:31 - 3:37)
a vindaloo a tikka masala (3:34 - 3:41)
a tandoori maybe some delicious biryani (3:37 - 3:45)
i i apologize for my ignorance (3:41 - 3:49)
i when i was at twitchcon (3:45 - 3:52)
uh i got roped into going to a (3:49 - 3:55)
restaurant where i i was not familiar (3:52 - 3:56)
with the menu (3:55 - 3:59)
and you had to sit on the floor on (3:56 - 4:02)
pillows and then you washed your hands (3:59 - 4:03)
they like washed your hands in front and (4:02 - 4:05)
then there was supposed to be (4:03 - 4:09)
belly dancing and again i'm not sure (4:05 - 4:11)
what kind of restaurant this was (4:09 - 4:14)
and that didn't happen like they didn't (4:11 - 4:15)
do it on (4:14 - 4:17)
friday or i'm not sure if we went on (4:15 - 4:18)
friday or saturday but they were like oh (4:17 - 4:20)
we do those on sundays or something like (4:18 - 4:21)
that (4:20 - 4:25)
and uh i'm not sure what i (4:21 - 4:27)
ordered but i didn't love it i want to (4:25 - 4:28)
say there was rice involved and there (4:27 - 4:30)
was chicken involved which is probably (4:28 - 4:31)
what i would order at an indian (4:30 - 4:32)
restaurant (4:31 - 4:34)
i would say point me to whatever chicken (4:32 - 4:36)
because every restaurant has chicken (4:34 - 4:39)
um i mean it's extensive when you're (4:36 - 4:44)
having non-vegetarian indian food yes (4:39 - 4:44)
i would say that most likely he got a (4:45 - 4:48)
chicken biryani (4:47 - 4:52)
yeah but probably (4:48 - 4:55)
would have also potentially gotten a (4:52 - 4:56)
tandoori chicken (4:55 - 4:58)
because there's not a lot of spices it's (4:56 - 5:00)
just it's just grilled chicken (4:58 - 5:03)
with indian spices on it really it is (5:00 - 5:04)
the most (5:03 - 5:07)
safe entry into indian food i i can see (5:04 - 5:11)
steve as a tandoori chicken yeah (5:07 - 5:13)
a little shout out if if the uh the fine (5:11 - 5:15)
owners of bay leaf indian cuisine and (5:13 - 5:17)
egan are listening (5:15 - 5:19)
uh could could you add a little more (5:17 - 5:21)
spice to the medium spicy because i got (5:19 - 5:22)
nothing (5:21 - 5:24)
off that i i don't want to have to go to (5:22 - 5:26)
full hot (5:24 - 5:28)
[Laughter] (5:26 - 5:30)
you got to keep some spice at home so (5:28 - 5:32)
you can i mean (5:30 - 5:34)
spice it up yourself just so the next (5:32 - 5:35)
time you go (5:34 - 5:37)
for indian food steve because when you (5:35 - 5:39)
move out here we're going for indian at (5:37 - 5:40)
least once a month (5:39 - 5:45)
um the the biryani is the fried rice (5:40 - 5:50)
of indian food i mean which is (5:45 - 5:51)
i mean you're good you're you're (5:50 - 5:54)
starting internet drama with that one so (5:51 - 5:56)
you're on your own i'm not even gonna (5:54 - 5:59)
try to correct it i'm just gonna be like (5:56 - 6:00)
greg what's your what's your go-to for (5:59 - 6:03)
indian food (6:00 - 6:06)
uh so it depends on how (6:03 - 6:09)
rice based i'm feeling uh so if i really (6:06 - 6:11)
just want a rice just i'm going to get (6:09 - 6:14)
uh biryani uh i will get (6:11 - 6:16)
uh i usually will get a korma i like (6:14 - 6:21)
kormas a lot um (6:16 - 6:25)
a vindaloo if i'm feeling (6:21 - 6:25)
i'm feeling it but usually i'm a cormo (6:26 - 6:32)
i'm usually into the korma i yeah i (6:29 - 6:32)
usually (6:32 - 6:35)
myself just roll the dice and anything (6:32 - 6:37)
that i can get with either goat or lamb (6:35 - 6:39)
that's that's what i'm gonna go for yeah (6:37 - 6:40)
i mean i (6:39 - 6:43)
often go chicken but like if i have a (6:40 - 6:45)
lot if i've eaten a lot of chicken then (6:43 - 6:46)
i will (6:45 - 6:48)
branch out into a wide variety (6:46 - 6:50)
whatever's on the menu really like (6:48 - 6:52)
that sounds good uh there's a really (6:50 - 6:55)
good place that does a buffet that (6:52 - 6:59)
um sadly we have not been able to do (6:55 - 7:00)
said buffet (6:59 - 7:02)
all right we're taking steve there uh (7:00 - 7:03)
but i will say this (7:02 - 7:07)
last sunday (7:03 - 7:09)
prior to this recording we ordered a (7:07 - 7:11)
bunch of food from them and created our (7:09 - 7:13)
own buffet (7:11 - 7:16)
in our house we ordered way too much (7:13 - 7:17)
food (7:16 - 7:19)
uh set it all out of the counter and (7:17 - 7:22)
pretended we were at a restaurant (7:19 - 7:24)
well speaking of pretending we got some (7:22 - 7:26)
pokemon news (7:24 - 7:32)
and to pretend no more greg (7:26 - 7:32)
this has been a bad 25 year (7:32 - 7:39)

pretend (7:42 - 7:46)
no more following me no deantha (7:43 - 7:50)
has been added to pokemon map well i get (7:46 - 7:50)

around for two years (7:56 - 7:59)
uh they just celebrated one point five (7:57 - 8:01)
one one and a half okay (7:59 - 8:03)
uh we're gonna start we're gonna start (8:01 - 8:04)
off with the pokemon master news this is (8:03 - 8:05)
off (8:04 - 8:08)
pocketgamer.com uh pokemon masters ex (8:05 - 8:11)
latest update welcomes champion iris (8:08 - 8:13)
with high dragon (8:11 - 8:16)
uh tapasio and (8:13 - 8:19)
alongside the duos they can expect (8:16 - 8:20)
another (8:19 - 8:23)
event battle which is the impending (8:20 - 8:27)
kalos champion deanthe and gardevoir (8:23 - 8:31)
which will um (8:27 - 8:33)
when is when is she she's supposed to (8:31 - 8:35)
arrive on the 31st i think (8:33 - 8:37)
yeah the banner is not up yet and i've (8:35 - 8:39)
been saving my (8:37 - 8:42)
gems to pull onset banner (8:39 - 8:45)
yes iris is available now who cares (8:42 - 8:49)
i okay i have recently gotten into (8:45 - 8:51)
regularly playing a gotcha game (8:49 - 8:54)
it is pokemon answers gunshin impact (8:51 - 8:55)
okay (8:54 - 8:58)
so i have begun to start to understand (8:55 - 9:00)
some of these terms that you guys use (8:58 - 9:01)
because there are banners (9:00 - 9:04)
in denture impact and it's like because (9:01 - 9:06)
it shows you a little rectangle and it's (9:04 - 9:08)
like if you do this one these are the (9:06 - 9:09)
things you won't (9:08 - 9:12)
get you will not get them (9:09 - 9:15)
there is a minor chance you'll get them (9:12 - 9:17)
and it's minor at best (9:15 - 9:19)
well and then like venti is promoted and (9:17 - 9:20)
it's like i keep (9:19 - 9:21)
pulling on that one i don't understand (9:20 - 9:23)
why it's called pulling because i'm not (9:21 - 9:24)
pulling anything (9:23 - 9:28)
but buying that banner um (9:24 - 9:30)
it's pulling like a physical card game (9:28 - 9:32)
term like you're pulling from a pack (9:30 - 9:35)
oh that's true yeah i mean i think the (9:32 - 9:36)
slot machine you're pulling (9:35 - 9:38)
oh man oh you're right you're pulling it (9:36 - 9:40)
out that's impossible (9:38 - 9:42)
but i had now that you say that because (9:40 - 9:44)
i bought two (9:42 - 9:47)
packs of uh i bought three packs of (9:44 - 9:49)
adventure time yesterday i didn't get (9:47 - 9:51)
any good pulls right now that's (9:49 - 9:53)
well how much money have you put in the (9:51 - 9:54)
uh (9:53 - 9:57)
ginger impact zero greg how much money (9:54 - 9:59)
did you put in (9:57 - 10:02)
against an impact zero uh i didn't play (9:59 - 10:04)
for very long because the (10:02 - 10:06)
controls (10:04 - 10:06)
bothered me like oh i was playing on the (10:07 - 10:11)
ipad and it was just like (10:10 - 10:14)
100 secret get yourself an xbox (10:11 - 10:16)
controller pair it to your ipad play it (10:14 - 10:18)
through the xbox controller it's a whole (10:16 - 10:20)
other okay but fantastic experience that (10:18 - 10:22)
is putting money into the game (10:20 - 10:24)
you're buying an xbox controller use (10:22 - 10:26)
that xbox controller for other stuff i (10:24 - 10:27)
never finished my question (10:26 - 10:29)
you could use a playstation controller (10:27 - 10:31)
too true (10:29 - 10:33)
true he also doesn't have one of those (10:31 - 10:34)
um (10:33 - 10:38)
why why are there like 30 different (10:34 - 10:42)
currency things 400 (10:38 - 10:44)
hey masters only has two and they named (10:42 - 10:45)
them exactly the same yeah i mean (10:44 - 10:47)
masters is the worst (10:45 - 10:52)
by far but what's the point (10:47 - 10:52)
so i mean in general the point is (10:52 - 10:58)
mostly it's one currency is is paid and (10:56 - 11:01)
one you can get for free (10:58 - 11:04)
and then depending on the game (11:01 - 11:06)
the currencies will break down to what (11:04 - 11:07)
you can (11:06 - 11:11)
pull in game from the banner based on (11:07 - 11:12)
that well that's all right (11:11 - 11:14)
okay so genji impacted right it has like (11:12 - 11:16)
these two kinds of fates or whatever yep (11:14 - 11:18)
and it's like some banners you get with (11:16 - 11:20)
uh intertwined faint (11:18 - 11:22)
and some banners you can get with the (11:20 - 11:24)
acquaint fate and you have to like do (11:22 - 11:27)
different things to get the two (11:24 - 11:28)
different (11:27 - 11:33)
can i just why (11:28 - 11:36)
so masters has what's called a fair (11:33 - 11:37)
scout banner (11:36 - 11:39)
which is what iris is under right now (11:37 - 11:41)
and all that means so normally a (11:39 - 11:44)
banner in masters is a seven percent (11:41 - 11:45)
chance of getting (11:44 - 11:49)
a five star and when it's fair scout (11:45 - 11:52)
it's a ten percent chance of getting a (11:49 - 11:53)
five star (11:52 - 11:55)
and if you they change this at the year (11:53 - 11:58)
anniversary if you do a 10-pole (11:55 - 12:00)
you get a bonus 11th poll which greg and (11:58 - 12:02)
i speculated that we weren't sure they (12:00 - 12:02)
were gonna keep (12:02 - 12:05)
back in the day and they did decide to (12:02 - 12:06)
keep it which was nice they did (12:05 - 12:08)
because they did not guarantee a four (12:06 - 12:09)
star (12:08 - 12:12)
because their pull system is still (12:09 - 12:13)
pretty garbage (12:12 - 12:15)
but at least if you pull ted there's now (12:13 - 12:17)
at least a reason to pull 10 whereas (12:15 - 12:17)
there just (12:17 - 12:20)
wasn't any reason to pull attend before (12:17 - 12:21)
um (12:20 - 12:25)
iris is a five-star tech sync pair (12:21 - 12:26)
and it has access to breaking swipe (12:25 - 12:29)
which lowers the opponent's attack (12:26 - 12:31)
uh snarl which lowers the pokemon's (12:29 - 12:33)
special attack (12:31 - 12:35)
and then hydrogen's sync move which is (12:33 - 12:36)
triple threat (12:35 - 12:39)
dragon rush which does more damage based (12:36 - 12:40)
on how (12:39 - 12:42)
many how much the target's stats have (12:40 - 12:45)
been lowered (12:42 - 12:48)
i've been told that iris is good um (12:45 - 12:50)
and iris is really good if you also have (12:48 - 12:52)
blue with blastoise (12:50 - 12:56)
because uh blastoise is very bulky and (12:52 - 12:58)
defensive and iris lowers everything so (12:56 - 12:58)
you live (12:58 - 13:02)
forever is the is the pairing (12:58 - 13:04)
i i would assume that people would want (13:02 - 13:06)
to probably save for deantha (13:04 - 13:09)
and gardevoir (13:06 - 13:09)
is that just because diana has been on (13:10 - 13:13)
the (13:12 - 13:16)
loading screen for since day one and (13:13 - 13:19)
it's now a year and a half later is the (13:16 - 13:20)
best (13:19 - 13:23)
champion well i mean iris (13:20 - 13:26)
was also a great champion spoiler (13:23 - 13:29)
champion but not the best champion oh (13:26 - 13:31)
that's like my favorite story that's (13:29 - 13:32)
ever come from this podcast is when you (13:31 - 13:34)
were getting black and white too and you (13:32 - 13:36)
were in the checkout line and irene (13:34 - 13:38)
picked up the guide and (13:36 - 13:39)
like scrolled through it and you saw (13:38 - 13:43)
that iris was the champion as a spoiler (13:39 - 13:45)
that was like the one pokemon the one (13:43 - 13:47)
pokemon game i tried to like not look at (13:45 - 13:48)
any spoilers for and it really (13:47 - 13:51)
hit me in the butt at this point i just (13:48 - 13:53)
look at all the spoilers now (13:51 - 13:57)
i'm not safe anyways um (13:53 - 13:59)
there's also so the the the other hype (13:57 - 14:01)
around diana is there's not a lot of (13:59 - 14:02)
fairy type attackers (14:01 - 14:06)
no in the game um and so dianth has also (14:02 - 14:09)
been uh speculated (14:06 - 14:11)
i'm sure data mined at this point that (14:09 - 14:13)
she's going to be the best (14:11 - 14:16)
fairy type attacker but we'll we'll wait (14:13 - 14:16)
till (14:16 - 14:19)
she arrives yeah because like (14:16 - 14:22)
xerneas is just a tank it will keep it (14:19 - 14:24)
just stays alive (14:22 - 14:27)
that thing rex house so in competitive (14:24 - 14:28)
pokemon (14:27 - 14:30)
where what category does fairy type (14:28 - 14:33)
typically fall into (14:30 - 14:36)
in like vgc sure (14:33 - 14:37)
oh it's it's up there it's very very (14:36 - 14:39)
good so the reason why is it like (14:37 - 14:43)
is it like uh is it a a tank (14:39 - 14:46)
more of a tanky is it more of a support (14:43 - 14:47)
is it more of uh (14:46 - 14:50)
what does they call adp is that is that (14:47 - 14:51)
a term (14:50 - 14:56)
is it more of a more changing um (14:51 - 14:59)
well there was there was togekiss in the (14:56 - 15:00)
early seasons (14:59 - 15:03)
of vgc which was uh just critical hit (15:00 - 15:05)
non-stop and it either critical hit (15:03 - 15:06)
either (15:05 - 15:09)
flying type moves or fairy type moves (15:06 - 15:10)
and then (15:09 - 15:12)
early vgc there was sylveon which was an (15:10 - 15:14)
attacker (15:12 - 15:17)
the dominant fairy right now is probably (15:14 - 15:20)
tapu finney which i would say is more (15:17 - 15:21)
support (15:20 - 15:23)
um it would be like setting up misty (15:21 - 15:25)
terrain it would be like (15:23 - 15:28)
uh usually call mind and (15:25 - 15:32)
getting health back it would be (15:28 - 15:33)
i was just thinking like when people (15:32 - 15:35)
talk about pokemon types and like one of (15:33 - 15:36)
the things (15:35 - 15:39)
i may get the words wrong but i think (15:36 - 15:40)
that i frequently hear is people are (15:39 - 15:41)
like (15:40 - 15:45)
ice type is a very defensive type right (15:41 - 15:49)
so nice type was a very fragile type (15:45 - 15:49)
what i would say ice types were more (15:50 - 15:54)
world glass cannons (15:52 - 15:58)
okay so what would fairy type be (15:54 - 16:00)
um fairy tape is just well-rounded i (15:58 - 16:02)
would say okay (16:00 - 16:05)
i would say i would say well-rounded i (16:02 - 16:07)
will i'll have to pull up my i did a (16:05 - 16:08)
spreadsheet once (16:07 - 16:11)
because i was going to make an rpg once (16:08 - 16:11)
uh (16:11 - 16:14)
a mystery dungeon rpg to be effect and i (16:11 - 16:18)
took the average stats (16:14 - 16:21)
of every of that type (16:18 - 16:23)
where it was the primary type and did a (16:21 - 16:25)
spreadsheet to find out (16:23 - 16:28)
which in which average to always be (16:25 - 16:29)
higher (16:28 - 16:31)
and i don't remember what it came out to (16:29 - 16:33)
be but i have it (16:31 - 16:35)
i have i have the spreadsheet one day i (16:33 - 16:37)
will finish my mystery dungeon rpg (16:35 - 16:40)
and in mystery dungeon of (16:37 - 16:43)
uh what pokemon masters in pokemon (16:40 - 16:44)
masters (16:43 - 16:48)
do you have duel types yes yes (16:44 - 16:51)
okay so gardevoir can be psychic fairy (16:48 - 16:53)
yes but the only part we actually care (16:51 - 16:55)
about is the fairy part because (16:53 - 16:58)
psychics overdone (16:55 - 16:58)
well it depends what the moves are and (16:59 - 17:06)
uh what how how garter bar is going to (17:03 - 17:06)
be built (17:06 - 17:09)
because you only get four moves one is (17:06 - 17:10)
usually (17:09 - 17:12)
one there's always one that's at least (17:10 - 17:14)
like (17:12 - 17:17)
the i will increase or i will do (17:14 - 17:19)
something because of the bond between me (17:17 - 17:21)
and my trainer so it usually has like a (17:19 - 17:22)
fancy name (17:21 - 17:25)
like like your main character with (17:22 - 17:27)
pikachu has jumpstart which makes you go (17:25 - 17:29)
faster (17:27 - 17:29)
uh (17:31 - 17:35)
somebody has is it professor oak that's (17:33 - 17:36)
like dreams come true (17:35 - 17:38)
or something yeah something like that (17:36 - 17:39)
yeah (17:38 - 17:41)
where are you like you hit that instead (17:39 - 17:42)
of actually doing a move (17:41 - 17:44)
so it depends on how many moves they (17:42 - 17:46)
actually make very how many moves next (17:44 - 17:49)
like champion time or whatever yeah (17:46 - 17:51)
well but steve just said we need a good (17:49 - 17:53)
fairy attacker and pokemon masters and (17:51 - 17:55)
you're assuming (17:53 - 17:58)
that gardevar is going to be an attack (17:55 - 17:58)
based (17:58 - 18:01)
i think (17:58 - 18:05)
i think when they added iris the anthem (18:01 - 18:07)
was in the data mine (18:05 - 18:09)
i guess that's not a big secrets that's (18:07 - 18:11)
not official how dare you (18:09 - 18:14)
but yeah i think (18:11 - 18:14)
uh speaking of (18:16 - 18:20)
hacking yes speaking of hacking (18:20 - 18:26)
uh pokemon zoroark the masters of (18:23 - 18:27)
illusions (18:26 - 18:30)
is on pokemon tv i love that movie i am (18:27 - 18:32)
watching that two (18:30 - 18:35)
nights it is available until april 2nd (18:32 - 18:36)
free to watch (18:35 - 18:40)
what what level of hot dog cart is (18:36 - 18:42)
in this where would where would we rank (18:40 - 18:44)
zoroark masters of illusion (18:42 - 18:48)
number one best pokemon movie ever (18:44 - 18:48)
oh wait wait let me let me rephrase i (18:48 - 18:52)
left out some words (18:50 - 18:55)
number one best pokemon movie ever that (18:52 - 18:58)
also features celebi (18:55 - 18:59)
there's a lot of celebrity in a lot of (18:58 - 19:02)
pokemon movies as this is the best one (18:59 - 19:02)
about (19:02 - 19:05)
any of the pokemon i will say i will say (19:02 - 19:07)
zoroark masters of illusion (19:05 - 19:11)
better than power of us oh well (19:07 - 19:13)
everything's better than power of us uh (19:11 - 19:15)
i will say that zoroac master positions (19:13 - 19:16)
in the top five (19:15 - 19:20)
top five power yeah power of us is (19:16 - 19:23)
literally the worst movie um i think i (19:20 - 19:25)
would put at the bottom of my list too (19:23 - 19:29)
it's just i would probably say (19:25 - 19:31)
that the zoroark movie is not as good as (19:29 - 19:34)
the genesect movie (19:31 - 19:40)
the general movie is pretty alright (19:34 - 19:40)
yeah i think that things are works (19:42 - 19:44)
better than the dynastic movie it is (19:43 - 19:47)
definitely not (19:44 - 19:47)
as bad as the location movie but (19:48 - 19:53)
canadian is pretty pretty down (19:51 - 19:54)
oh yeah yeah this is better than that (19:53 - 19:55)
okay that one's garbage well candy on (19:54 - 19:59)
might be second worst movie (19:55 - 19:59)
i don't know i choose you is in there (20:00 - 20:05)
no it's pretty alright that's a good (20:03 - 20:09)
movie i saw that movie in hawaii (20:05 - 20:09)
i will never forget seeing i choose you (20:10 - 20:14)
in theaters (20:12 - 20:17)
and then like the whole theater was very (20:14 - 20:19)
well behaved you know you didn't have (20:17 - 20:22)
anyone talking or anyone screaming (20:19 - 20:24)
um and as soon as the credits were over (20:22 - 20:25)
i just remember this (20:24 - 20:28)
this like redneck dad standing up going (20:25 - 20:33)
i still don't get it are they all (20:28 - 20:33)
pikachu (20:33 - 20:39)
[Music] (20:35 - 20:41)
i mean i do remember seeing in the film (20:39 - 20:42)
in the theater because we were in the (20:41 - 20:42)
back (20:42 - 20:46)
and there was maybe 10 people total in (20:42 - 20:47)
the theater (20:46 - 20:51)
uh and during the one part almost (20:47 - 20:52)
everybody laughed (20:51 - 20:56)
so oh yeah yeah yeah (20:52 - 20:57)
that's one of those situations i find (20:56 - 21:00)
where it's like if people have heard (20:57 - 21:01)
about a movie and then (21:00 - 21:03)
it's like they hear everybody says oh (21:01 - 21:05)
well this part is going to happen (21:03 - 21:06)
and then they feel like they have to (21:05 - 21:08)
laugh even if they didn't really feel it (21:06 - 21:10)
in their heart to laugh at that point in (21:08 - 21:11)
time (21:10 - 21:14)
because i certainly didn't laugh uh i (21:11 - 21:15)
was more confused (21:14 - 21:17)
like the second day and people hadn't (21:15 - 21:20)
been talking about it and people still (21:17 - 21:22)
laughed so i'm glad that that part (21:20 - 21:24)
wasn't spoiled for me (21:22 - 21:27)
um i kind of wish it was fine for me (21:24 - 21:28)
because (21:27 - 21:30)
it's been long we could talk about it (21:28 - 21:32)
right it's been long enough no you can't (21:30 - 21:33)
get there okay (21:32 - 21:35)
what five years four years oh no when (21:33 - 21:38)
did i choose you come out hold on (21:35 - 21:40)
oh i was i was in hawaii so it was five (21:38 - 21:41)
years (21:40 - 21:44)
anniversary 20th anniversary right (21:41 - 21:49)
no 2017 the 2017 film (21:44 - 21:52)
pokemon the movie i choose you (21:49 - 21:52)
well if somebody's man that seems like a (21:53 - 21:56)
very long time ago they have not seen it (21:55 - 22:00)
by now (21:56 - 22:00)
because they're six years old yeah (22:00 - 22:04)
they're waiting for six year olds (22:03 - 22:05)
listening to an (22:04 - 22:08)
audio podcast of three 30 plus year olds (22:05 - 22:10)
arguing about we are about to get a (22:08 - 22:11)
thousand (22:10 - 22:15)
emails the kindergarten grasses (22:11 - 22:18)
spoiler alert for i choose you stop (22:15 - 22:19)
listening (22:18 - 22:21)
at this point if you do not want to know (22:19 - 22:22)
skipping (22:21 - 22:27)
my second point in that film (22:22 - 22:28)
what am i the one that's supposed to say (22:27 - 22:30)
what happened yes you are you are the (22:28 - 22:32)
the person that brought up the spoilage (22:30 - 22:33)
so you are the spoiler (22:32 - 22:37)
so near the end of the movie (22:33 - 22:43)
uh a bunch of pokemon hyper beam ash (22:37 - 22:43)
into oblivion is it a bunch of pokemon (22:43 - 22:48)
or just one pokemon it's like the like (22:45 - 22:51)
queen yeah it was like it was like the (22:48 - 22:53)
bunch of pokemon and then (22:51 - 22:56)
um ash wakes up and then (22:53 - 23:00)
pikachu explains why the entire time (22:56 - 23:02)
through their journey they never (23:00 - 23:04)
went like pikachu talks which is the (23:02 - 23:06)
part where everyone laughs at (23:04 - 23:08)
and says like the reason i didn't go (23:06 - 23:10)
into my pokeball is because i wanted to (23:08 - 23:10)
be (23:10 - 23:14)
with you outside the pokeball and for (23:10 - 23:15)
any of our (23:14 - 23:17)
uh really diligent listeners i mentioned (23:15 - 23:18)
this like (23:17 - 23:20)
two weeks ago (23:18 - 23:20)
and so people laughed and made fun of it (23:22 - 23:26)
because (23:25 - 23:27)
i guess maybe they didn't understand (23:26 - 23:29)
what happened which was (23:27 - 23:31)
no i think a lot of people didn't (23:29 - 23:33)
understand what happened honestly no (23:31 - 23:37)
like i disagree like ash dies (23:33 - 23:39)
right ash dies which which a lot of (23:37 - 23:40)
people didn't get they just thought he (23:39 - 23:41)
got (23:40 - 23:42)
blown up because he gets electrocuted in (23:41 - 23:44)
like every anime he dies (23:42 - 23:47)
he dies he like pikachu just doesn't (23:44 - 23:48)
suddenly doesn't talk (23:47 - 23:50)
it's like the afterlife i compared a lot (23:48 - 23:51)
to (23:50 - 23:54)
when harry sees his like self when (23:51 - 23:57)
voldemort does the thing (23:54 - 24:00)
i don't that he was resurrected at that (23:57 - 24:02)
point it's not in his (24:00 - 24:04)
look i don't remember that harry potter (24:02 - 24:05)
that well but there's a weird part (24:04 - 24:07)
that's very similar to the end of harry (24:05 - 24:07)
potter (24:07 - 24:10)
ash wasn't dead when that part happened (24:07 - 24:11)
what what the pikachu (24:10 - 24:15)
yeah yes he was because (24:11 - 24:15)
it hadn't hit yet it hadn't hit yet (24:15 - 24:18)
because (24:17 - 24:20)
ash was like getting the ball getting (24:18 - 24:21)
the ball you'll be safe if you're (24:20 - 24:22)
getting the ball (24:21 - 24:26)
no he he gets hit he gets hit (24:22 - 24:28)
and then pikachu talks we're gonna have (24:26 - 24:30)
to i'll contact my (24:28 - 24:33)
netflix dvd subscription and then we'll (24:30 - 24:34)
see (24:33 - 24:37)
and then because ho-oh is there and ho (24:34 - 24:41)
is the resurrection pokemon ho (24:37 - 24:43)
brings ash back to life that is actually (24:41 - 24:45)
what happens (24:43 - 24:47)
but it happened so fast that i i think (24:45 - 24:49)
people just were like oh pikachu just (24:47 - 24:51)
straight up talked for like five seconds (24:49 - 24:52)
the problem is is that the majority of (24:51 - 24:54)
the people in this world have (24:52 - 24:56)
zero imagination and couldn't postulate (24:54 - 24:57)
anything (24:56 - 25:00)
as a answer to the question of why is (24:57 - 25:02)
pikachu talking other than he could talk (25:00 - 25:03)
the entire time (25:02 - 25:05)
and was just choosing not to say (25:03 - 25:07)
anything (25:05 - 25:09)
okay being weakened by martial on the (25:07 - 25:11)
other pokemon ash tells pikachu to get (25:09 - 25:13)
in his pokeball but pikachu refuses (25:11 - 25:15)
because he always wants to stay by ash's (25:13 - 25:17)
side however ash finally forces him into (25:15 - 25:18)
his pokeball (25:17 - 25:21)
as pokemon attacks ash causing his body (25:18 - 25:22)
to disappear (25:21 - 25:25)
yes see in despair but he said i want to (25:22 - 25:27)
be by your side before the attacks hit (25:25 - 25:28)
yes really (25:27 - 25:32)
yes yes i don't know (25:28 - 25:34)
i'm going to watch that i see it right (25:32 - 25:36)
here in the thing i just said it to you (25:34 - 25:36)
i still (25:36 - 25:40)
think that it's uh more that (25:36 - 25:43)
like it was like a the power of the (25:40 - 25:46)
connection between ash and pikachu (25:43 - 25:48)
allowed them in this very intense moment (25:46 - 25:51)
to have why are we looking for a logical (25:48 - 25:52)
answer (25:51 - 25:57)
i'm a cartoon i stand by the fact (25:52 - 25:57)
that moment came too early that moment (25:59 - 26:06)
would have worked after death (26:03 - 26:07)
resurrection and coming back (26:06 - 26:09)
and they had much more time to sort of (26:07 - 26:11)
be in the after effects (26:09 - 26:14)
than right in the middle of all that and (26:11 - 26:15)
it felt (26:14 - 26:17)
weird it felt weird where it was placed (26:15 - 26:19)
and that is still why people laughed (26:17 - 26:20)
because (26:19 - 26:22)
i i i don't disagree it definitely was (26:20 - 26:24)
like weird i get what they were going (26:22 - 26:24)
for though (26:24 - 26:26)
like they had to like but it would have (26:24 - 26:28)
been more effective (26:26 - 26:31)
post everything else (26:28 - 26:33)
post all of it and it would it would (26:31 - 26:35)
have it wouldn't have cut (26:33 - 26:38)
the tension so weirdly and it wouldn't (26:35 - 26:40)
have felt so out of place (26:38 - 26:41)
people laughed and i always say like (26:40 - 26:43)
well people have different reactions (26:41 - 26:44)
like (26:43 - 26:47)
if one third of your audience laughs (26:44 - 26:48)
one-third (26:47 - 26:50)
doesn't understand what happened and (26:48 - 26:52)
one-third is (26:50 - 26:54)
like into it your moment didn't land (26:52 - 26:55)
correctly you didn't (26:54 - 26:57)
you didn't set it up properly yeah yeah (26:55 - 26:58)
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you (26:57 - 26:58)
gotta get 80 (26:58 - 27:00)
of the people that is my biggest issue (26:58 - 27:02)
with when that happens it's not weird (27:00 - 27:04)
that people laughed at it because like i (27:02 - 27:04)
said i (27:04 - 27:06)
i get why people laughed at it it's it (27:04 - 27:08)
it is weird though when you think about (27:06 - 27:09)
the first pokemon movie (27:08 - 27:13)
where like pokemon literally cried (27:09 - 27:16)
and the tears that floated into the air (27:13 - 27:16)
yeah (27:16 - 27:18)
brought ash back to life like that is (27:16 - 27:20)
also pretty weird (27:18 - 27:22)
but i think that moment no no no no (27:20 - 27:24)
tears have amazing resurrection (27:22 - 27:26)
tears have powers that people at (27:24 - 27:28)
hospitals are always crying (27:26 - 27:30)
the the reason why that worked is (27:28 - 27:32)
because the tension (27:30 - 27:35)
was at its breaking point and everybody (27:32 - 27:37)
needed that release (27:35 - 27:39)
the reason why this didn't work is (27:37 - 27:40)
because we were (27:39 - 27:42)
in the middle of the tension and they (27:40 - 27:44)
broke it at the wrong time (27:42 - 27:46)
they broke the sense of tension that (27:44 - 27:48)
everybody had (27:46 - 27:50)
was something that was so out of place (27:48 - 27:51)
that also (27:50 - 27:54)
the phrase itself didn't match (27:51 - 27:56)
up to what pikachu had been doing when (27:54 - 27:58)
they hadn't met like you weren't (27:56 - 27:59)
friends and you didn't want to get in (27:58 - 28:01)
the pokeball then so saying i wasn't (27:59 - 28:04)
wanting to get into the pokeball (28:01 - 28:07)
this entire time is because we were good (28:04 - 28:08)
friends when the first half of the movie (28:07 - 28:10)
was you becoming friends made that whole (28:08 - 28:13)
the whole thing felt weird and it came (28:10 - 28:14)
at the wrong time (28:13 - 28:17)
if it had come after post death then it (28:14 - 28:19)
would have been much more sense why did (28:17 - 28:21)
you not go in the ball (28:19 - 28:24)
that line would have hit you now we're (28:21 - 28:26)
both dead at least one of us could have (28:24 - 28:28)
survived also (28:26 - 28:31)
when the first pokemon movie came out in (28:28 - 28:32)
1990 (28:31 - 28:34)
whatever uh (28:32 - 28:36)
[Music] (28:34 - 28:39)
we we did not know at that point in time (28:36 - 28:42)
how often well that yeah ash is (28:39 - 28:43)
fundamentally (28:42 - 28:46)
immortal and can never be (28:43 - 28:49)
destroyed he is like matter energy (28:46 - 28:52)
and ash in this universe he converted (28:49 - 28:55)
one to the other but you can never (28:52 - 28:55)
destroy (28:57 - 29:01)
do you think do you think that scene (28:58 - 29:03)
ruined that movie i don't think so i (29:01 - 29:04)
think no i think it's (29:03 - 29:06)
like i don't think anyone was like oh (29:04 - 29:08)
that movie sucks because of that scene i (29:06 - 29:09)
think people just (29:08 - 29:12)
no i think i have i have many other (29:09 - 29:13)
reasons why that (29:12 - 29:15)
why i was not a fan of that movie that (29:13 - 29:16)
is just that is the one that people (29:15 - 29:17)
point to (29:16 - 29:19)
i would argue that the structure of a (29:17 - 29:21)
lot of the film (29:19 - 29:25)
uh fails uh i still like (29:21 - 29:26)
as much as i criticized the movie i (29:25 - 29:28)
still think it was a good movie (29:26 - 29:31)
um but there were a number of things (29:28 - 29:32)
that i felt were (29:31 - 29:34)
fundamentally wrong with that film and i (29:32 - 29:35)
still think they're not as good as this (29:34 - 29:37)
movie no but it still thinks there (29:35 - 29:39)
aren't better man i don't (29:37 - 29:41)
i will say probably bottom of the barrel (29:39 - 29:43)
worst pokemon movie (29:41 - 29:46)
is definitely the uh (29:43 - 29:51)
reshiram zekron movie that is so (29:46 - 29:54)
oh so bad is that the one with the giant (29:51 - 29:55)
organ at the end (29:54 - 29:57)
that's the one where golurk flies for (29:55 - 29:59)
the first time and yeah that one's (29:57 - 30:00)
awesome (29:59 - 30:02)
no which is the one that has the giant (30:00 - 30:03)
musical organ (30:02 - 30:05)
or pipe or we should just turn this (30:03 - 30:07)
podcast into continual reviews of the (30:05 - 30:09)
very few pokemon movies that exist (30:07 - 30:10)
because we always (30:09 - 30:13)
go down this hole no there are like 23 (30:10 - 30:14)
pokemon movies (30:13 - 30:17)
yeah there are 453 episodes of this (30:14 - 30:19)
program where we continually review (30:17 - 30:23)
23 pokemon movies (30:19 - 30:25)
okay we'll have one final special (30:23 - 30:27)
episode where we all have to watch all (30:25 - 30:29)
23 movies and then rate them (30:27 - 30:33)
in a row no breaks that is a five hour (30:29 - 30:35)
podcast right there when we're all in (30:33 - 30:36)
the same location (30:35 - 30:40)
we'll all set aside a week (30:36 - 30:42)
exist at the same spot and torture (30:40 - 30:46)
ourselves watching all 23 movies (30:42 - 30:50)
uh all right there was some new pokemon (30:46 - 30:51)
center merchandise added there was a (30:50 - 30:53)
kitchen collection added (30:51 - 30:56)
oh no (30:53 - 30:56)
that butter dish is sweet and you know (30:57 - 31:00)
it no no no no (30:59 - 31:03)
they added a ceramic utensil holder a (31:00 - 31:04)
ceramic (31:03 - 31:06)
treat jar i don't know why they just (31:04 - 31:07)
didn't call it a cookie jar it's (31:06 - 31:08)
literally what (31:07 - 31:10)
it is no because you can put cookies (31:08 - 31:12)
anymore you can put dog treats in it (31:10 - 31:12)
it's not (31:12 - 31:15)
just for cookies i guess uh ceramic (31:12 - 31:16)
mixing bowls (31:15 - 31:19)
i'm not i'm not one to hang out in the (31:16 - 31:21)
kitchen too often do people want ceramic (31:19 - 31:23)
bowls or do i thought they wanted like (31:21 - 31:26)
plastic or glass or nobody wants plastic (31:23 - 31:29)
plastic is the wrap seems like power of (31:26 - 31:30)
us of (31:29 - 31:32)
kitchen materials but if you drop (31:30 - 31:34)
ceramic it breaks right (31:32 - 31:36)
well that's what makes it so precious (31:34 - 31:39)
yeah oh if you drop plastic it bounces (31:36 - 31:42)
okay people do not give value based on (31:39 - 31:43)
drop ability (31:42 - 31:45)
yeah but if it was stainless steel it (31:43 - 31:46)
would also it would dent (31:45 - 31:50)
but it would still be good i mean once (31:46 - 31:51)
again (31:50 - 31:54)
determine value by bouncibility all of (31:51 - 31:56)
the materials behave (31:54 - 31:57)
differently and are used for different (31:56 - 32:00)
reasons but as a collection they made (31:57 - 32:03)
the molotow ceramic (32:00 - 32:03)
ah there's they said like everything (32:03 - 32:06)
else is ceramic it's it'll be weird to (32:04 - 32:08)
be like here's (32:06 - 32:10)
five ceramic pieces for your kitchen set (32:08 - 32:11)
and these three (32:10 - 32:15)
are plastic oh really probably be (32:11 - 32:16)
cheaper if they're plastic (32:15 - 32:19)
pikachu ceramic baking dishes a pikachu (32:16 - 32:23)
ceramic pie dish and a pikachu (32:19 - 32:26)
ceramic serving plate and then they (32:23 - 32:30)
they released pikachu (32:26 - 32:33)
ceramic salt and pepper shakers which i (32:30 - 32:37)
ordered oh you did i did already (32:33 - 32:39)
but did you get the most important one i (32:37 - 32:40)
oh i don't know (32:39 - 32:43)
a pikachu the last one is the pikachu (32:40 - 32:46)
kitchen ceramic butter dish this gives (32:43 - 32:46)
me (32:46 - 32:50)
so many issues it just gives me i (32:46 - 32:52)
i mean obviously i was moved to the (32:50 - 32:53)
point of texting you (32:52 - 32:57)
both and saying why does this exist this (32:53 - 32:58)
should not exist (32:57 - 33:01)
i mean why should it not exist because i (32:58 - 33:01)
do like about (33:01 - 33:05)
2021 no don't put butter on the table (33:01 - 33:10)
yes yes where are you supposed to put it (33:05 - 33:12)
keep it in the refrigerator to be used (33:10 - 33:14)
as an ingredient not a condiment butter (33:12 - 33:17)
is not a condiment i can i can get i (33:14 - 33:20)
can see the taste and the discord (33:17 - 33:22)
messages you know how many negative (33:20 - 33:26)
reviews we've had (33:22 - 33:26)
okay i hate butter so you can send your (33:28 - 33:34)
hate mail to me (33:32 - 33:37)
however i live in a butter loving home (33:34 - 33:40)
who does already have a butter dish out (33:37 - 33:43)
and i did send this text (33:40 - 33:46)
to my husband should i get this as our (33:43 - 33:47)
new butter dish (33:46 - 33:51)
and the response was yes question mark (33:47 - 33:54)
which is not a definitive answer so (33:51 - 33:57)
i have not purchased the butter dish i (33:54 - 33:58)
will say (33:57 - 34:00)
my for my background and reasoning (33:58 - 34:02)
behind this number one i grew up in a (34:00 - 34:03)
tupperware house where the majority of (34:02 - 34:04)
the (34:03 - 34:07)
stuff was plastic thank you (34:04 - 34:11)
everything okay i cannot stand (34:07 - 34:12)
tupperware (34:11 - 34:15)
number two what is wrong with tupperware (34:12 - 34:15)
farts (34:15 - 34:18)
there was always a butter dish on the (34:15 - 34:19)
table (34:18 - 34:22)
and that thing because it (34:19 - 34:25)
perpetually had a stick of butter in it (34:22 - 34:29)
was never cleaned oh so it just has like (34:25 - 34:32)
years worth of butter residue in there (34:29 - 34:35)
because like butter doesn't go bad yeah (34:32 - 34:36)
but obviously (34:35 - 34:40)
kind of but also okay butter is (34:36 - 34:43)
an ingredient in things not (34:40 - 34:47)
on things look as somebody who doesn't (34:43 - 34:48)
spend a lot of time in the kitchen (34:47 - 34:50)
there's very few things i know how to (34:48 - 34:51)
make (34:50 - 34:54)
one of them is toast (34:51 - 34:57)
and by putting two pieces of bread into (34:54 - 34:58)
a toaster (34:57 - 35:01)
and then having access to not (34:58 - 35:06)
solid butter yeah it is (35:01 - 35:08)
if we remove the butter from the counter (35:06 - 35:10)
then that's one less thing i can (35:08 - 35:12)
keep your butter in the refrigerator we (35:10 - 35:18)
have we have the butter (35:12 - 35:18)
as the person that will make toast and (35:22 - 35:25)
not put butter on it (35:23 - 35:27)
what are you putting on your toast hold (35:25 - 35:29)
on a little what are you putting on your (35:27 - 35:30)
toast if it's not butter peanut butter (35:29 - 35:34)
jelly butter jelly or nothing like (35:30 - 35:36)
cream cheese oh you know what's real (35:34 - 35:37)
good bread i do (35:36 - 35:40)
how dare you look at me with this shot (35:37 - 35:40)
look (35:40 - 35:44)
try this i say i want the pure taste of (35:40 - 35:46)
toasted bread (35:44 - 35:49)
unaltered by your strange outside (35:46 - 35:50)
influence no (35:49 - 35:52)
but here i got i got i i've got key for (35:50 - 35:54)
you and for anybody who's like spent (35:52 - 35:55)
their life just like (35:54 - 35:59)
under the strong arm of big dairy butter (35:55 - 36:02)
holding you down yeah this is what you (35:59 - 36:03)
got to do (36:02 - 36:06)
because cows deserve a better life (36:03 - 36:09)
get yourself some ricotta cheese (36:06 - 36:12)
when you make your toast you spread that (36:09 - 36:12)
ricotta (36:12 - 36:15)
cheese on the toast get one of those (36:12 - 36:16)
like coarse (36:15 - 36:19)
salt grinders grind yourself some coarse (36:16 - 36:20)
sea salt on top of that ricotta cheese (36:19 - 36:22)
and just a little sprinkle of pepper (36:20 - 36:24)
little tiniest sprinkle of pepper that (36:22 - 36:26)
is the best way to have toast i'm not on (36:24 - 36:27)
board with (36:26 - 36:29)
ricotta cheese i think like i don't like (36:27 - 36:31)
so i don't like cream i'm very picky (36:29 - 36:32)
about my (36:31 - 36:34)
cheese textures i don't like cream (36:32 - 36:36)
cheese because i hate the sourness (36:34 - 36:38)
uh and i'm trying to remember if i've (36:36 - 36:40)
had ricotta cheese recently enough (36:38 - 36:42)
to say i would do that and that's don't (36:40 - 36:45)
be flavorless (36:42 - 36:49)
i okay so okay i'm living my pokemon (36:45 - 36:50)
life right (36:49 - 36:52)
we can if you're watching on youtube you (36:50 - 36:53)
can see a bunch of pokemon stuff behind (36:52 - 36:54)
me (36:53 - 36:57)
it's for the most part stays to my (36:54 - 36:58)
office (36:57 - 36:59)
uh and we have pokemon stuff throughout (36:58 - 37:00)
the house right like we have like a (36:59 - 37:03)
pokemon blanket uh like a throw blanket (37:00 - 37:04)
on our bed (37:03 - 37:06)
uh in the in the kitchen we have like (37:04 - 37:07)
the pokemon apron (37:06 - 37:09)
in the living room we have like one or (37:07 - 37:11)
two pokemon plushies (37:09 - 37:13)
that we like rotate out every now and (37:11 - 37:16)
then so i i have pokemon sprinkled (37:13 - 37:17)
throughout the house (37:16 - 37:19)
and there's a good balance i think (37:17 - 37:21)
sometimes people have (37:19 - 37:23)
way too much of something you ever walk (37:21 - 37:24)
into somebody's kitchen and they like (37:23 - 37:26)
have a theme going on (37:24 - 37:28)
and you're like and then they walk into (37:26 - 37:29)
the bathroom and they have a whole (37:28 - 37:30)
nother theme going on (37:29 - 37:32)
yes my parents are like terrier (37:30 - 37:33)
decoration and (37:32 - 37:37)
the no like not into that any like not (37:33 - 37:38)
into like (37:37 - 37:40)
the rooster bathroom that my parents (37:38 - 37:41)
have were (37:40 - 37:44)
like look if your (37:41 - 37:46)
room doesn't have a theme how do you (37:44 - 37:48)
know what to do in there that's true (37:46 - 37:49)
that's true (37:48 - 37:50)
but uh so i like i like a little (37:49 - 37:52)
subtlety you know (37:50 - 37:55)
so i i felt like the pikachu butter dish (37:52 - 37:56)
was like (37:55 - 37:59)
too much but the salt and pepper shakers (37:56 - 38:00)
were like (37:59 - 38:02)
cute like cute enough no no so but see (38:00 - 38:03)
the thing is (38:02 - 38:05)
now like if you're gonna go in you gotta (38:03 - 38:06)
go in at least (38:05 - 38:10)
in a set right it's like if i'm gonna (38:06 - 38:10)
have (38:10 - 38:13)
the pikachu salt and pepper shakers on (38:10 - 38:15)
the table and i'm going to have a butter (38:13 - 38:17)
dish because i live in greg's house (38:15 - 38:19)
then i might as well have the pikachu (38:17 - 38:20)
butter dish (38:19 - 38:23)
all right okay go ahead (38:20 - 38:25)
i was gonna say the the thing like out (38:23 - 38:27)
of all these items (38:25 - 38:31)
that i would buy would be the pikachu (38:27 - 38:34)
pie dish yeah because it's like this is (38:31 - 38:34)
good (38:34 - 38:38)
if i'm gonna make a pie let me make a (38:34 - 38:39)
cute pie for you (38:38 - 38:43)
this is my worry and maybe the maybe the (38:39 - 38:44)
cost (38:43 - 38:46)
should make me feel better but i don't (38:44 - 38:48)
think so i got the (38:46 - 38:51)
moo moo milk collection it was (38:48 - 38:54)
remember that two plates and then two (38:51 - 38:55)
bottles i think there's actually a (38:54 - 38:57)
bottle behind me (38:55 - 39:00)
um and i kept one (38:57 - 39:02)
sealed right and put it next to my (39:00 - 39:03)
ancient mew (39:02 - 39:05)
gotta let it appreciate in value so i (39:03 - 39:07)
can pay for my kids college (39:05 - 39:09)
and then i use the other one as like hey (39:07 - 39:11)
we're actually gonna use the i mean (39:09 - 39:13)
they're plate like their plates right (39:11 - 39:14)
like let's use them as like little (39:13 - 39:17)
plates and (39:14 - 39:23)
that design is no longer on the plate (39:17 - 39:23)
was this a pokemon center yes it was the (39:24 - 39:27)
little (39:26 - 39:29)
it was the mill tank with the blue lines (39:27 - 39:31)
and the red circle around it and was it (39:29 - 39:32)
ceramic (39:31 - 39:35)
i'm not sure if they were it wasn't (39:32 - 39:36)
plastic (39:35 - 39:39)
not i don't think they were plastic (39:36 - 39:42)
all right i have a fundamental question (39:39 - 39:44)
you have you have pikachu (39:42 - 39:46)
[Music] (39:44 - 39:50)
salt and pepper shakers in your house (39:46 - 39:52)
do you know which one you are supposed (39:50 - 39:54)
to put the pepper in (39:52 - 39:57)
um i figured it would probably tell you (39:54 - 40:00)
no there's no mercenaries there's no s p (39:57 - 40:00)
there is (40:00 - 40:03)
one clue and i am testing you (40:00 - 40:05)
yeah because any of us from the 70s we (40:03 - 40:08)
know this answer oh wait okay so (40:05 - 40:09)
to describe because this is an audio (40:08 - 40:11)
podcast (40:09 - 40:13)
uh for most people there's a pikachu (40:11 - 40:14)
with both eyes open (40:13 - 40:17)
and then there's a pikachu with one eye (40:14 - 40:18)
winking (40:17 - 40:20)
winky winky i would assume that the (40:18 - 40:21)
winking one (40:20 - 40:25)
is the salt (40:21 - 40:29)
incorrect no incorrect (40:25 - 40:31)
what would you make your judgment based (40:29 - 40:32)
on what how do you make your choice (40:31 - 40:34)
because it's thinking at you that you're (40:32 - 40:36)
being unhealthy by having no no (40:34 - 40:40)
no no no no no there is like every (40:36 - 40:43)
shaker out there is marked by this (40:40 - 40:45)
so that you know which one's the salt (40:43 - 40:48)
and which one's the pepper (40:45 - 40:48)
what is this (40:49 - 40:55)
it's the number of holes on top number (40:53 - 40:58)
one (40:55 - 40:59)
no i can't see the number of holes in (40:58 - 41:01)
this picture you can you can't you can't (40:59 - 41:02)
just one (41:01 - 41:05)
of the pictures look at the uh (41:02 - 41:09)
last picture oh the last picture (41:05 - 41:11)
yeah the pepper always has more holes (41:09 - 41:13)
yep (41:11 - 41:15)
you failed you're you're i thought we (41:13 - 41:17)
were going off the eyes i thought you (41:15 - 41:19)
were saying like if we had like (41:17 - 41:21)
uh like like a woody woodpecker salt (41:19 - 41:23)
shaker one woody woodpecker would be (41:21 - 41:24)
winking and one would not (41:23 - 41:28)
take these particular i had mentioned (41:24 - 41:30)
i was you guys you guys sold it as like (41:28 - 41:32)
the 70s there was always like one (41:30 - 41:35)
salt shaker winking at you and one nut (41:32 - 41:36)
no (41:35 - 41:38)
there was in the 70s always the one that (41:36 - 41:41)
had the most hole at the top (41:38 - 41:41)
we were literally taught this in (41:42 - 41:46)
elementary school so we didn't (41:45 - 41:50)
fill our shakers incorrectly but talking (41:46 - 41:50)

pokemon center store dot com dot com dot (41:56 - 42:00)
org (41:59 - 42:03)

other figures sold separately protective (43:36 - 43:40)
pads at the bottom help keep (43:38 - 43:43)
this piece steady on most smooth (43:40 - 43:44)
surfaces (43:43 - 43:47)
each figure is hand painted to highlight (43:44 - 43:48)
the details of the scene (43:47 - 43:52)
natural variations in paint may occur a (43:48 - 43:53)
pokemon center (43:52 - 43:56)
original it's made out of resin not (43:53 - 43:57)
ceramic (43:56 - 44:01)
the country of origin is china it is (43:57 - 44:04)
four and a half by nine by six (44:01 - 44:08)
inches and they said there are more (44:04 - 44:11)
they didn't say how many more and they (44:08 - 44:12)
didn't show (44:11 - 44:15)
what the other ones look like (44:12 - 44:17)
but it's that you're gonna have a parade (44:15 - 44:20)
of pokemon throughout the year (44:17 - 44:20)
look i don't know i'm strangely (44:21 - 44:25)
attracted to this thing and i hate like (44:23 - 44:26)
every one of these figurines that (44:25 - 44:28)
they've ever made and yet strangely (44:26 - 44:31)
looking at this one i kind of want it (44:28 - 44:32)
i just know it's going to be as bad as (44:31 - 44:34)
the train set (44:32 - 44:36)
it's going to feel cheap they didn't (44:34 - 44:38)
even say how many there are (44:36 - 44:39)
the train said they at least said there (44:38 - 44:41)
was four well this isn't limited (44:39 - 44:42)
quantity (44:41 - 44:44)
this is limited purchase oh oh oh oh oh (44:42 - 44:45)
you were saying (44:44 - 44:47)
number of uh participants in the parade (44:45 - 44:49)
yeah (44:47 - 44:52)
hmm they're really good they they must (44:49 - 44:54)
have figured out that this just works (44:52 - 44:56)
they like oh yeah they did the the (44:54 - 44:58)
pikachu one which i which i did (44:56 - 45:01)
which was the the 12 pikachus with funko (44:58 - 45:01)
and i (45:01 - 45:03)
actually greg you got some of those (45:01 - 45:04)
didn't you no (45:03 - 45:06)
you didn't get oh i think they're great (45:04 - 45:07)
quality they're awesome like i didn't (45:06 - 45:09)
get any of the funkos i also don't (45:07 - 45:10)
really like funko (45:09 - 45:12)
they're i did get the train and i hated (45:10 - 45:13)
the train quality (45:12 - 45:16)
yeah the the pikachu funkos when they (45:13 - 45:17)
did that for (45:16 - 45:18)
whatever year that was they did a (45:17 - 45:20)
different pikachu every it's not the (45:18 - 45:21)
funkos with the big black eyes because (45:20 - 45:23)
funko makes toys they they make (45:21 - 45:26)
other things besides the big but they're (45:23 - 45:27)
really really great (45:26 - 45:29)
and i got all of them and i think they (45:27 - 45:30)
were 16 (45:29 - 45:34)
each and they came out once every month (45:30 - 45:36)
and i got the wholesale collection and (45:34 - 45:37)
then they did the train (45:36 - 45:40)
the train was forty dollars there was (45:37 - 45:41)
four (45:40 - 45:44)
of them and i got the first one and it (45:41 - 45:44)
was (45:44 - 45:47)
bad and i was like i'm not i can't (45:44 - 45:48)
if it was good quality i would have paid (45:47 - 45:50)
40 every month or (45:48 - 45:52)
not every month whenever they released (45:50 - 45:54)
it then they did another set of four (45:52 - 45:54)
trains (45:54 - 45:57)
this past year and i don't know they (45:54 - 45:58)
sold out like instantly or something (45:57 - 45:59)
because i don't remember them ever being (45:58 - 46:00)
up on the website (45:59 - 46:02)
but there were like two people in our (46:00 - 46:05)
slack that said they got the trains (46:02 - 46:08)
um and then they did the eevee stuff (46:05 - 46:10)
which was also through funko (46:08 - 46:13)
um where they did the 12 evs 12. no that (46:10 - 46:15)
was like nine (46:13 - 46:16)
ten something like that there was not (46:15 - 46:18)
twelve ev evolutions (46:16 - 46:20)
no yeah they yeah they had one for every (46:18 - 46:22)
each they were like (46:20 - 46:25)
and then they did the four uh haunted (46:22 - 46:26)
houses (46:25 - 46:29)
which were bad quality (46:26 - 46:32)
because they were the same as the train (46:29 - 46:34)
and i don't know how i feel about this (46:32 - 46:36)
it looks like it's better than the train (46:34 - 46:38)
and better than the haunted houses but (46:36 - 46:40)
not as good as the funko but (46:38 - 46:42)
also more expensive the train looked (46:40 - 46:44)
good on the one picture they did but if (46:42 - 46:46)
you zoom in on these pictures you can (46:44 - 46:48)
see the same issues i had with the train (46:46 - 46:51)
which is there it just painted (46:48 - 46:53)
usually the paint is bad like if you (46:51 - 46:55)
look at in their promo picture (46:53 - 46:59)
the transition of pikachu's feet to the (46:55 - 47:01)
saddle that he's wearing like already (46:59 - 47:03)
the paint looks bad there (47:01 - 47:06)
yeah it's like the second picture (47:03 - 47:10)
and same with the back oh (47:06 - 47:13)
and his little shirt and tie that's not (47:10 - 47:14)
so great (47:13 - 47:17)
they just they always just like you (47:14 - 47:18)
expect (47:17 - 47:21)
a level of crispness in these products (47:18 - 47:23)
that you aren't getting because they are (47:21 - 47:26)
hand painted (47:23 - 47:26)
you can get better painters or just let (47:27 - 47:34)
a machine do it better (47:30 - 47:35)
just let a machine do it and say it's (47:34 - 47:37)
hand painted as long as it looks good i (47:35 - 47:38)
don't care (47:37 - 47:41)
i don't know attempted i don't like the (47:38 - 47:43)
ground they're walking on (47:41 - 47:46)
i think it looks well it looks like a (47:43 - 47:47)
pebbled street (47:46 - 47:49)
yeah it does look like yeah you can see (47:47 - 47:50)
a little confetti on it which kind of (47:49 - 47:51)
looks cool (47:50 - 47:54)
yeah it just looks like the (47:51 - 47:57)
the demarcations between the (47:54 - 48:01)
cobblestones look like rivers of tartany (47:57 - 48:03)
and i'm not into that maybe arkanis is a (48:01 - 48:05)
little hot (48:03 - 48:06)
a little hot melting the melting the (48:05 - 48:08)
cobblestone in the air the asphalt i (48:06 - 48:09)
feel like i would be (48:08 - 48:12)
almost more willing to okay so this is (48:09 - 48:14)
this is my thought process (48:12 - 48:16)
if they showed all five let's say (48:14 - 48:17)
there's five of them (48:16 - 48:20)
and they showed all five and the other (48:17 - 48:22)
four are cooler than this (48:20 - 48:26)
i would then feel in in uh i would then (48:22 - 48:27)
feel like i would need to buy this (48:26 - 48:30)
even though i don't love this because i (48:27 - 48:31)
want to complete the set (48:30 - 48:34)
yeah but now my worry is what if the (48:31 - 48:35)
second one has (48:34 - 48:39)
like chimecho and cramer ant (48:35 - 48:43)
and aromatees everyone's three favorite (48:39 - 48:45)
pokemon (48:43 - 48:47)
this one sells out and then you can you (48:45 - 48:49)
can you can't get the second one now (48:47 - 48:50)
because you didn't get the first one (48:49 - 48:52)
and now it's like i don't have a leader (48:50 - 48:54)
of the parade i got an aromatise here (48:52 - 48:54)
and (48:54 - 48:58)
it's like what's happening like i don't (48:54 - 48:58)
know (48:58 - 49:01)
well maybe maybe aromatisse is the head (48:58 - 49:04)
of your parade maybe you showed up late (49:01 - 49:06)
maybe maybe you should be happy with the (49:04 - 49:07)
ones that you get (49:06 - 49:08)
and not worry about being a (49:07 - 49:10)
completionist well (49:08 - 49:12)
with the eevee and with the pikachu (49:10 - 49:13)
funko stuff they (49:12 - 49:15)
they didn't show all of them but they at (49:13 - 49:17)
least showed like silhouettes (49:15 - 49:18)
so you at least knew how many there were (49:17 - 49:21)
you could at least kind of guess (49:18 - 49:23)
what's happening with this parade the (49:21 - 49:25)
parade will last as long as the money (49:23 - 49:26)
holds up (49:25 - 49:27)
[Applause] (49:26 - 49:29)
[Laughter] (49:27 - 49:30)
they're like we got the start of the (49:29 - 49:32)
parade done we got the end of the train (49:30 - 49:32)
then (49:32 - 49:34)
if it keeps selling we'll keep making (49:32 - 49:36)
the middle of the parade (49:34 - 49:38)
the middle is just like schroedinger's (49:36 - 49:39)
parade (49:38 - 49:41)
until you look at it you don't know (49:39 - 49:44)
what's gonna happen i (49:41 - 49:48)
it's not forty dollars it's 30. it's 30. (49:44 - 49:50)
it's also not a house i'm kind of mad (49:48 - 49:53)
that the pokemon magikarp fitted tank (49:50 - 49:54)
top is already sold out (49:53 - 49:55)
yeah i was going to send that to you too (49:54 - 49:58)
but it sold out so that's so (49:55 - 50:01)
fast and it's super cute although (49:58 - 50:06)
i i don't know who (50:01 - 50:08)
gave the art direction to the model's (50:06 - 50:09)
faces (50:08 - 50:12)
the model that may haven't make the (50:09 - 50:13)
faces in these pictures because they are (50:12 - 50:15)
oh you know that's stock photography and (50:13 - 50:16)
they just (50:15 - 50:18)
cut and paste the clothes onto them (50:16 - 50:20)
[Laughter] (50:18 - 50:22)
do you think our great grandparents had (50:20 - 50:25)
these kinds of discussions about yeah (50:22 - 50:28)

645 this thing is (50:46 - 50:53)
gorgeous is it hand painted though oh i (50:49 - 50:58)

like (55:31 - 55:36)
yeah how much you're gonna do (55:33 - 55:36)
what are you so creative i guess what do (55:36 - 55:41)
you what do you expect (55:39 - 55:43)
i mean they're nice i think i would i (55:41 - 55:44)
like the (55:43 - 55:47)
black one quite a bit um (55:44 - 55:49)
i think this is cool for india it's cool (55:47 - 55:51)
that they get their own event i'm sure (55:49 - 55:52)
plenty of trainers around the world (55:51 - 55:54)
complain that you know go fest was in (55:52 - 55:55)
chicago and they can't travel to go fest (55:54 - 55:57)
and blah blah so it's cool that they got (55:55 - 55:59)
their own event there was the um (55:57 - 56:03)
mexican event a little bit ago uh (55:59 - 56:05)
i'm sure germany will eventually get (56:03 - 56:06)
their (56:05 - 56:08)
safari zone or whatever probably later (56:06 - 56:10)
this year (56:08 - 56:12)
it seems likely we were talking on the (56:10 - 56:13)
break about how (56:12 - 56:16)
pax is announcing dates for conventions (56:13 - 56:17)
and gen con is (56:16 - 56:19)
announcing dates it's probably very (56:17 - 56:21)
likely that (56:19 - 56:24)
in yeah in weeks or months that niantic (56:21 - 56:26)
will start doing their (56:24 - 56:28)
hey we're doing events they're all (56:26 - 56:30)
outdoor we're limiting the amount of (56:28 - 56:30)
people (56:30 - 56:32)
we have hand santana's sand (56:30 - 56:35)
sanitizations everywhere (56:32 - 56:38)
i am i'm sure niantic will probably (56:35 - 56:41)
uh say something sooner rather than (56:38 - 56:43)
later honestly (56:41 - 56:43)
which i feel like i would rather do a (56:44 - 56:47)
niantic (56:46 - 56:50)
outdoor event than to go to a convention (56:47 - 56:54)
inside a building i think this year (56:50 - 56:57)
i am still with you on that yes (56:54 - 56:59)
as i just as a preference for how my (56:57 - 57:00)
events are handled yes (56:59 - 57:02)
yeah i mean as a preference but i'm (57:00 - 57:04)
really eager to get back to (57:02 - 57:08)
seeing people so yeah you know (57:04 - 57:11)
i i got i got i am prepping for it i'm (57:08 - 57:13)
prepping to be inside i got my things (57:11 - 57:16)
going on i got you know (57:13 - 57:16)
uh the other thing here pokemon go (57:17 - 57:21)
related is niantic updated the (57:19 - 57:25)
all-in-one 151 master research pokestop (57:21 - 57:27)
task that was a mouthful (57:25 - 57:31)
um so after you complete the (57:27 - 57:35)
catch 30 of every type and catch for (57:31 - 57:37)
31 days in a row which i think some (57:35 - 57:39)
people are still on (57:37 - 57:40)
it's like step two i believe i'm still (57:39 - 57:42)
on the first step (57:40 - 57:45)
yeah uh the third step which was the one (57:42 - 57:47)
revealed earlier so this is a whole (57:45 - 57:49)
conversation and it's kind of taken us a (57:47 - 57:52)
while to get to talking about it but (57:49 - 57:55)
when they announced the kanto (57:52 - 57:59)
tour that we did the three of us (57:55 - 58:01)
safely well safe as we could be at mall (57:59 - 58:02)
of america (58:01 - 58:06)
um i'm so happy i got a hotel room that (58:02 - 58:07)
we were able to grab (58:06 - 58:09)
food eat in the hotel room not near (58:07 - 58:10)
anyone (58:09 - 58:13)
yeah that was a good call (58:10 - 58:16)
so they announced the the kanto tour it (58:13 - 58:17)
was (58:16 - 58:20)
12 right or 11 (58:17 - 58:24)
anyways uh and then there (58:20 - 58:28)
it was the 12-hour event it was the (58:24 - 58:32)
there was worries prior to this of (58:28 - 58:34)
what if i can't catch all 151 i won't be (58:32 - 58:35)
able to get mew (58:34 - 58:38)
that wasn't the case which i assured (58:35 - 58:40)
people the way they worded it was (58:38 - 58:42)
the mew quest was going to be separate (58:40 - 58:43)
um (58:42 - 58:45)
you got a shiny ditto you got 12 hours (58:43 - 58:46)
of stuff you got the tray you have (58:45 - 58:49)
whatever you got all the rewards (58:46 - 58:52)
and then there are some people that only (58:49 - 58:53)
wanted the shiny mew (58:52 - 58:56)
they spent the 12.99 and then they were (58:53 - 58:58)
very upset that they had to work (58:56 - 59:00)
for the shiny me i mean we talked about (58:58 - 59:02)
this at length we talked about this and (59:00 - 59:03)
the biggest thing (59:02 - 59:06)
that people were definitely upset about (59:03 - 59:07)
was you had to be level (59:06 - 59:09)
40 to get the shiny mu which is still (59:07 - 59:12)
the case it is the third step (59:09 - 59:16)
and i on this program (59:12 - 59:19)
the positive beacon i am (59:16 - 59:23)
the negative one yeah said level four (59:19 - 59:24)
is the last thing you have to worry (59:23 - 59:26)
about (59:24 - 59:28)
because because at the time we didn't (59:26 - 59:30)
know the other steps but there are (59:28 - 59:33)
the other steps are there's a lot (59:30 - 59:34)
there's a lot to them (59:33 - 59:37)
there's a lot so (59:34 - 59:37)
i would argue that catching 30 dragon (59:38 - 59:41)
times (59:40 - 59:44)
is way harder than getting to level 40 (59:41 - 59:45)
right now (59:44 - 59:48)
uh there so the first the first task i (59:45 - 59:50)
don't remember it that well but it was (59:48 - 59:50)
like (59:50 - 59:53)
uh i'm still on it oh yeah yeah yeah (59:50 - 59:54)
let's go let's go through all the time (59:53 - 59:54)
yeah (59:54 - 59:57)
i'm still on number one it was uh make (59:54 - 60:01)
151 great throws which i've got 79. (59:57 - 60:02)
you could do that if you're a hardcore (60:01 - 60:04)
player you could do that in a day (60:02 - 60:04)
technically (60:04 - 60:07)
uh 751 gifts which (60:04 - 60:09)
i mean you technically would have to do (60:07 - 60:11)
that in two days if you're a hardcore (60:09 - 60:12)
player because the game only (60:11 - 60:16)
limits you of sending a hundred gifts (60:12 - 60:18)
a day yes i've completed that one and (60:16 - 60:21)
when you guys left after mall of america (60:18 - 60:24)
um i walked around the mall empty (60:21 - 60:26)
because the mall closes at nine but (60:24 - 60:29)
you can be in it until 10. so i walked (60:26 - 60:30)
around the mall like three times and i (60:29 - 60:32)
was able to send like 50 gifts that (60:30 - 60:33)
night (60:32 - 60:35)
um to like get a little head start on (60:33 - 60:36)
that (60:35 - 60:40)
so it was send 150 gifts 150 great (60:36 - 60:41)
throws what were the other two (60:40 - 60:46)
151 151 great throws (60:41 - 60:48)
i can't see it because i already oh the (60:46 - 60:50)
other one was uh (60:48 - 60:52)
complete your poke was completely canto (60:50 - 60:54)
pokedex (60:52 - 60:56)
pokedex which i didn't have until the (60:54 - 60:58)
canter tour right but that wasn't (60:56 - 60:58)
exactly (60:58 - 61:00)
right that wasn't no you didn't have to (60:58 - 61:02)
do it without 12 hours (61:00 - 61:05)
i mean it caught them so it was just me (61:02 - 61:06)
being lazy i (61:05 - 61:08)
never got a poly breath and i never got (61:06 - 61:10)
a vile poop i just never did it (61:08 - 61:12)
so i just finally did it yeah and then (61:10 - 61:14)
step two was (61:12 - 61:18)
catch a pokemon 30 days in a row (61:14 - 61:21)
so there was a 30 day minimum to even (61:18 - 61:24)
get shiny mankind if you missed a day (61:21 - 61:25)
you would have to start over (61:24 - 61:29)
and then it was catch 30 of every single (61:25 - 61:33)
type and as of right now (61:29 - 61:36)
i have completed all of that except (61:33 - 61:42)
i am missing i need 25 more dragons (61:36 - 61:45)
and it's been 30 days for me (61:42 - 61:48)
uh i need uh 19 more dark type and i (61:45 - 61:50)
need 17 more ferry which i (61:48 - 61:52)
kind of slept on ferry there was at one (61:50 - 61:54)
point there was jigglypuff's non-sp (61:52 - 61:55)
spawning non-stop and i was like ah (61:54 - 61:57)
that's i don't have to worry about that (61:55 - 61:59)
but now i'm not seeing any fairies (61:57 - 62:03)
so if i okay do (61:59 - 62:07)
double duel types count as (62:03 - 62:07)
yeah i mean they're cruel but they're (62:07 - 62:11)
not (62:10 - 62:15)
evil and so then after that (62:11 - 62:17)
you would have to get to level 40 you (62:15 - 62:19)
would have to walk (62:17 - 62:21)
151 kilometers (62:19 - 62:26)
easily done you would have to um (62:21 - 62:29)
don't walk that much (62:26 - 62:29)
you would have to uh what was the other (62:29 - 62:36)
one (62:33 - 62:36)
you have to get to level 40 walk 151 (62:36 - 62:40)
kilometers (62:39 - 62:44)
spin 151 unique stops unique stops which (62:40 - 62:44)
they (62:44 - 62:48)
changed oh yeah and now it's just you (62:44 - 62:50)
have to spend 151 (62:48 - 62:55)
poke stops yep but i don't think the 151 (62:50 - 62:56)
the 151 unique stock (62:55 - 62:58)
stops would definitely be a problem for (62:56 - 63:00)
people who live (62:58 - 63:02)
not in a city because you would have to (63:00 - 63:03)
travel for it (63:02 - 63:05)
yeah so the question that i had before (63:03 - 63:08)
they changed it was (63:05 - 63:08)
could you have visited that stop before (63:08 - 63:12)
like does it just happen (63:10 - 63:15)
that was the question because because i (63:12 - 63:16)
have visited (63:15 - 63:19)
i could i could maybe get to 151 unique (63:16 - 63:21)
stops i mean they've really cut down (63:19 - 63:24)
victory road but i've visited all of (63:21 - 63:25)
those before (63:24 - 63:28)
so if they didn't count i was gonna be (63:25 - 63:28)
up a creek (63:28 - 63:30)
road trip to saint cloud yeah let's go (63:28 - 63:33)
to let's go to duluth for the weekend (63:30 - 63:36)
hey i still haven't been i'll go yeah (63:33 - 63:37)
let's go to the aquarium (63:36 - 63:41)
um so let's get to yeah (63:37 - 63:43)
and so they changed it to just spin 151 (63:41 - 63:45)
stops which (63:43 - 63:46)
yeah i guess you could do that in like a (63:45 - 63:48)
day or if you lived in a big city or you (63:46 - 63:49)
need to travel to a big city you could (63:48 - 63:50)
probably do that in a day but (63:49 - 63:52)
i don't know if you can walk 151 (63:50 - 63:55)
kilometers in a day (63:52 - 63:58)
well does yeah easily (63:55 - 63:59)
no we talked about this i think you said (63:58 - 64:01)
you'd do like what you said you'd do (63:59 - 64:02)
like 40 kilometers a week now (64:01 - 64:06)
i do about 80 a week okay 40 kilometers (64:02 - 64:10)
i do 40 kilometers in a day come on now (64:06 - 64:10)
uh yeah i mean i i don't know i (64:11 - 64:15)
personally (64:14 - 64:17)
didn't have a problem with shiny mu (64:15 - 64:19)
being behind the level 40. (64:17 - 64:21)
but i also feel like everything this mew (64:19 - 64:22)
quest is asking for is (64:21 - 64:25)
is for like a hardcore player oh (64:22 - 64:27)
definitely oh absolutely (64:25 - 64:30)
it's it's shiny mew this is like the (64:27 - 64:32)
impossible pokemon it (64:30 - 64:36)
should be an achievement for hard work (64:32 - 64:37)
well done (64:36 - 64:40)
yes yeah i mean i (64:37 - 64:44)
i agree i'm gonna complete it in like (64:40 - 64:45)
five years (64:44 - 64:48)
so i just don't interact with the game (64:45 - 64:49)
that much (64:48 - 64:51)
yeah i'm sure i'm sure that will be a (64:49 - 64:53)
drag i like i am i'm sure if (64:51 - 64:55)
if the game told me it was windy it's (64:53 - 64:56)
actually windy right now and i turned on (64:55 - 64:57)
an incense (64:56 - 64:59)
and i probably played for the next 12 (64:57 - 65:01)
hours i'm sure because of his windy (64:59 - 65:03)
which makes dragon type spawn because of (65:01 - 65:04)
an incense and because i'm actively (65:03 - 65:05)
playing (65:04 - 65:07)
i'm sure i could probably make a dent in (65:05 - 65:09)
my dragon stuff yeah but also i mean i (65:07 - 65:10)
will say like this (65:09 - 65:13)
this quest does not entice me to (65:10 - 65:15)
because of the length that i know is (65:13 - 65:17)
going to take so long to get to i am not (65:15 - 65:21)
more enticed to play the game more often (65:17 - 65:22)
or (65:21 - 65:24)
more than i do now like yeah i don't (65:22 - 65:27)
think there's a problem with like (65:24 - 65:29)
i just you know you'll eventually get (65:27 - 65:30)
there i eventually get it yeah i'll (65:29 - 65:31)
eventually get there (65:30 - 65:34)
just like i eventually got to 40 and (65:31 - 65:36)
suffered through december (65:34 - 65:38)
like there should be a balance between (65:36 - 65:40)
time limited quest (65:38 - 65:41)
where you're like okay i gotta go out (65:40 - 65:44)
this this sunday evening because the (65:41 - 65:45)
quest is ending and i know i can do it i (65:44 - 65:47)
just gotta set aside two hours (65:45 - 65:50)
and that's fine but i um (65:47 - 65:52)
i guess um the the other side of the (65:50 - 65:54)
coin here is i'm glad that this quest (65:52 - 65:55)
doesn't (65:54 - 65:58)
feel like i need to like do it asap (65:55 - 66:01)
yeah there's no there's no rush because (65:58 - 66:02)
it feels like (66:01 - 66:04)
it feels like a marathon like the things (66:02 - 66:08)
they're asking for feel like a marathon (66:04 - 66:08)
yeah and it and if you're not 40 by the (66:09 - 66:13)
time you get through most of this quest (66:11 - 66:19)
you'll probably be 40. we can only hope (66:13 - 66:21)
and there's enough events where like if (66:19 - 66:22)
you're missing dragon or you're missing (66:21 - 66:23)
ice (66:22 - 66:25)
or you don't have enough experience like (66:23 - 66:26)
right now if (66:25 - 66:29)
you're getting what like bonus xp on (66:26 - 66:31)
raids if you do raids (66:29 - 66:34)
and you can do one free ride a day um (66:31 - 66:36)
so if if you're missing like ice pokemon (66:34 - 66:39)
i'm sure there will be some sort of (66:36 - 66:41)
fire and ice event of air apparently (66:39 - 66:42)
have they announced the next community (66:41 - 66:43)
today (66:42 - 66:47)
no they have not yet (66:43 - 66:49)
uh final bit of news here is uh (66:47 - 66:50)
researchers named (66:49 - 66:53)
newly discovered insects after legendary (66:50 - 66:55)
pokemon this is off to kotaku this was (66:53 - 66:56)
sent in by our slack (66:55 - 67:00)
community um let me just give credits (66:56 - 67:03)
to who sent that in that was james sent (67:00 - 67:04)
that in and then stephen also (67:03 - 67:07)
provided some insight here uh they (67:04 - 67:08)
provided some (67:07 - 67:09)
some a lot of science stuff that i don't (67:08 - 67:12)
know uh (67:09 - 67:17)
but if you guys didn't hear two intimal (67:12 - 67:20)
entomologists close (67:17 - 67:24)
close uh decided to name it (67:20 - 67:29)
ologists they study m m's (67:24 - 67:32)
uh they discovered a new species of (67:29 - 67:34)
australian beetles (67:32 - 67:36)
and they named them after articuno (67:34 - 67:38)
multrace and zapdos (67:36 - 67:43)
i'm gonna ruin this it is been burum (67:38 - 67:45)
yeah i think that's close yeah so that (67:43 - 67:47)
sounds right to me ben burham articuno (67:45 - 67:48)
the ben burham (67:47 - 67:52)
multrace and the bin burum zapdos (67:48 - 67:52)
is it still the thing if you discover is (67:53 - 67:56)
it like when you discover (67:55 - 67:58)
like a comet you get to name it you (67:56 - 68:00)
discover a bug you get to name it (67:58 - 68:02)
yes generally yeah if you if you (68:00 - 68:04)
discover it you get to name it okay (68:02 - 68:07)
it is the general rule i i think there (68:04 - 68:08)
might be some limits (68:07 - 68:10)
but generally if you found it you name (68:08 - 68:13)
it okay (68:10 - 68:16)
uh in the world of scientific research (68:13 - 68:17)
those who do the hard work of delivering (68:16 - 68:19)
new findings get to name it and in the (68:17 - 68:20)
case of eastern (68:19 - 68:26)
new mexico university and at entomology (68:20 - 68:26)
and australian national university phd (68:31 - 68:38)
student yun hasio that meant (68:34 - 68:41)
immortalizing their beatles discoveries (68:38 - 68:42)

of the pokemon's most famous powerful (68:42 - 68:45)
birds (68:45 - 68:48)

after (68:48 - 68:52)
pokemon's famous powerful beatles yeah (68:49 - 68:53)
why isn't it (68:52 - 68:56)
cast cooned (68:53 - 68:56)
how is it caterpie beetle what is wrong (68:57 - 69:01)
with you (69:00 - 69:05)
a heracross okay (69:01 - 69:07)
what other beetles do we have oh oh (69:05 - 69:11)
remove you from this program (69:07 - 69:15)
there's not a beer sure it is it is (69:11 - 69:18)
or beetle okay all right it's gotta name (69:15 - 69:19)
it dude (69:18 - 69:22)
i mean one could throw genesect in there (69:19 - 69:24)
true (69:22 - 69:24)
uh quote the choice of the name for a (69:28 - 69:31)
new species (69:30 - 69:33)
is not trivial it must be different than (69:31 - 69:36)
other described species pollock said (69:33 - 69:38)
one way to ensure this is to make a name (69:36 - 69:40)
that no one would happen to come up with (69:38 - 69:42)
before (69:40 - 69:44)
except for the pokemon company you're (69:42 - 69:45)
right (69:44 - 69:48)
you went on and say yun says that he was (69:45 - 69:50)
an aspiring pokemon trainer when he was (69:48 - 69:51)
young (69:50 - 69:53)
and so because of the rarity of specimen (69:51 - 69:55)
of the three new species he suggested we (69:53 - 69:57)
name him after the three legendary bird (69:55 - 69:58)
pokemon (69:57 - 70:00)
naturally i thought it was a great ideal (69:58 - 70:02)
and so the new species which were (70:00 - 70:05)
unveiled to the world in 2020 are (70:02 - 70:08)
burburum articuno multrace and zeptos (70:05 - 70:10)
all with hacio and pollock as the (70:08 - 70:11)
authors (70:10 - 70:13)
we already planned to describe more new (70:11 - 70:15)
species of the (70:13 - 70:17)
genus that have turned up since we (70:15 - 70:19)
finished the paper (70:17 - 70:22)
and perhaps with more pokemon names (70:19 - 70:24)
perhaps (70:22 - 70:24)
next ones will be anti-raiku and sweet (70:25 - 70:33)
the legendary dogs uh (70:29 - 70:36)
i mean the bugs are i mean they're bugs (70:33 - 70:37)
they're bugs yeah (70:36 - 70:38)
looking at the bugs and like they sure (70:37 - 70:41)
are bugs they're not exciting to look at (70:38 - 70:42)
i mean they're kind of exciting to look (70:41 - 70:43)
at well there are people who are into (70:42 - 70:45)
bugs i mean i mean i sort of get like (70:43 - 70:46)
the (70:45 - 70:48)
i think the coloring is very cool like i (70:46 - 70:50)
can see a little bit why they picked the (70:48 - 70:52)
name for each of them (70:50 - 70:53)
because like the articuno has the like (70:52 - 70:56)
the bluish eyes and the bluish head and (70:53 - 70:56)
like (70:56 - 70:59)
the moltres one is much more golden (70:56 - 71:02)
than the zapdos has more like it's got (70:59 - 71:04)
only go on top and you kind of see the (71:02 - 71:05)
gold through the wings like (71:04 - 71:07)
i kind of see why they picked the names (71:05 - 71:08)
for them but (71:07 - 71:12)
they sure are bugs (71:08 - 71:15)
greg give us our question of the week (71:12 - 71:18)

hercules oh i should do hercules (71:42 - 71:49)
uh this is from robert in our slack (71:45 - 71:51)
will there be a significance to the (71:49 - 71:53)
1000th pokemon (71:51 - 71:57)
yes next question (71:53 - 71:57)
isn't every pokemon significant (71:57 - 72:04)
it's gonna be the millennial pokemon (72:01 - 72:05)
it's gonna (72:04 - 72:07)
have a pokemon that's got tick tock and (72:05 - 72:09)
a phone in his hand and it's gonna have (72:07 - 72:10)
a bad attitude (72:09 - 72:12)
they kind of made a digimon kind of like (72:10 - 72:14)
that actually (72:12 - 72:16)
did they really yeah i'm still mad at (72:14 - 72:18)
you for not telling about rosamund (72:16 - 72:22)
rosemond yeah somebody needed to tell me (72:18 - 72:22)
nobody (72:22 - 72:25)
did i thought it ended at lilymon no (72:22 - 72:26)
there was nothing (72:25 - 72:28)
cool about digimon keeps going keep (72:26 - 72:29)
going (72:28 - 72:31)
keep going oh well the digimon card game (72:29 - 72:32)
looks so good (72:31 - 72:36)
no no no no no axe (72:32 - 72:40)
no but they got the digimon card game (72:36 - 72:41)
has like ladies in it too (72:40 - 72:43)
i know you like that in the vanguard (72:41 - 72:45)
look no (72:43 - 72:48)
and i have been (72:45 - 72:51)
paying attention to digimon tcg which i (72:48 - 72:51)
believe (72:51 - 72:55)
is either the fifth or sixth digimon tcg (72:51 - 72:57)
to come out (72:55 - 73:00)
a lot which also i mean if you want to (72:57 - 73:02)
go down this road we can talk about the (73:00 - 73:05)
fact that the current release is version (73:02 - 73:06)
1.5 (73:05 - 73:09)
which was i believe delayed because they (73:06 - 73:10)
can't figure out how they actually want (73:09 - 73:12)
to release this horrible horrible game (73:10 - 73:14)
they also released it and like banned (73:12 - 73:16)
the card right now (73:14 - 73:20)
that's bad uh uh how many (73:16 - 73:23)
versions does cole own oh no coal (73:20 - 73:26)
is getting into the new digimon the cars (73:23 - 73:29)
i mean okay let me see if i can get this (73:26 - 73:30)
as like (73:29 - 73:32)
short as possible because i could (73:30 - 73:34)
literally talk for (73:32 - 73:37)
hours on this particular topic but (73:34 - 73:40)
it's like vanguard players yes because (73:37 - 73:42)
the company that makes vanguard and new (73:40 - 73:44)
japan pro wrestling same company has (73:42 - 73:45)
been playing (73:44 - 73:47)
games with us for a couple of years now (73:45 - 73:49)
are always like (73:47 - 73:52)
i'm i'm quitting i'm moving to a better (73:49 - 73:53)
card game (73:52 - 73:56)
yu-gi-oh players that's been since the (73:53 - 73:57)
life of yu-gi-oh they're always looking (73:56 - 73:59)
for something better than yu-gi-oh (73:57 - 74:01)
because yukio is bottom of the barrel so (73:59 - 74:02)
now it's like (74:01 - 74:05)
when digimon the latest digimon tcg was (74:02 - 74:08)
announced last year they were (74:05 - 74:11)
everybody was like well vanguard is is (74:08 - 74:12)
junk and (74:11 - 74:14)
yugioh is junk so i'm going to digimon (74:12 - 74:15)
because that's going to be a great game (74:14 - 74:16)
and they're going to support it and (74:15 - 74:18)
they're going to make it blah but (74:16 - 74:21)
no and it has turned out to be just like (74:18 - 74:22)
every other (74:21 - 74:25)
digimon tcg that has ever been made a (74:22 - 74:29)
hot pile of trash plus (74:25 - 74:32)
anything with digimon on it is garbage (74:29 - 74:35)
oh my gosh i hate digimon i love i hate (74:32 - 74:35)
it (74:35 - 74:38)
i hate it they're the champion i hate (74:35 - 74:38)
the (74:38 - 74:41)
i watched the digimon i watched several (74:38 - 74:43)
seasons of the digimon cartoon (74:41 - 74:45)
do not like you didn't get heights when (74:43 - 74:47)
they started digivolving and they did (74:45 - 74:48)
the (74:47 - 74:52)
did no did you mind it's good (74:48 - 74:52)
i don't understand why those small (74:53 - 74:56)
children (74:56 - 75:00)
were abducted (74:56 - 75:00)
to another universe no it was the (75:00 - 75:04)
digital world (75:02 - 75:06)
it was the digital world that is also (75:04 - 75:07)
aka (75:06 - 75:11)
another universe i made i used to (75:07 - 75:13)
i used to have digimon based nicknames (75:11 - 75:15)
for my old dog (75:13 - 75:18)
okay it was a thing irene and i irene (75:15 - 75:20)
actually mentioned this the other (75:18 - 75:22)
day to me she was like they must be (75:20 - 75:24)
close to a thousand and i was like yes (75:22 - 75:27)
they're at 898 pokemon (75:24 - 75:30)
which the actual i think more (75:27 - 75:33)
interesting question is are they going (75:30 - 75:34)
to get to a thousand so (75:33 - 75:38)
add 102 pokemon in generation nine (75:34 - 75:41)
or are they going to milk it (75:38 - 75:41)
and only do like 30 50 (75:42 - 75:47)
and then would they hold the thousands (75:45 - 75:49)
up to the 30th anniversary (75:47 - 75:51)
yeah yeah i bet they hold it till gen (75:49 - 75:52)
10. (75:51 - 75:55)
i probably i bet they go i actually bet (75:52 - 75:57)
they go 99999 (75:55 - 76:00)
999 for gen 9. (75:57 - 76:02)
and then the 1000th will be the first (76:00 - 76:04)
introduce introducing pokemon of gen 10. (76:02 - 76:05)
that would be mine (76:04 - 76:08)
the only way that they would do that is (76:05 - 76:09)
if they do it in the same way that they (76:08 - 76:11)
did with victini i bet they would (76:09 - 76:13)
teeny was pokemon zero in the you know (76:11 - 76:15)
pokemon pokedex (76:13 - 76:18)
i bet they do i mean that doesn't matter (76:15 - 76:20)
it's gonna be mythical right like it's (76:18 - 76:22)
going to be a mythical bulk yeah (76:20 - 76:23)
it's not going to be a starter because (76:22 - 76:26)
those things are garbage (76:23 - 76:26)
yeah um yeah i would assume it would be (76:26 - 76:31)
mythical like victini (76:29 - 76:32)
but the victini thing was really (76:31 - 76:34)
confusing back in the day because they (76:32 - 76:37)
made it a big deal that it was zero (76:34 - 76:39)
yeah but it it wasn't it's like (76:37 - 76:41)
victini's pokedex number is like what (76:39 - 76:43)
like 586 or something (76:41 - 76:45)
it's just it's zero in the unova decks (76:43 - 76:46)
which isn't really (76:45 - 76:48)
that big of a deal but it was the first (76:46 - 76:50)
time that a mythical would be (76:48 - 76:53)
before the stars before the starters (76:50 - 76:55)
number one and number two (76:53 - 76:58)
it was i believe the first time (76:55 - 77:01)
that you could obtain the mythical like (76:58 - 77:02)
at the beginning (77:01 - 77:05)
of the game you needed i think just two (77:02 - 77:08)
badges but yes (77:05 - 77:09)
as opposed to having to wait until the (77:08 - 77:12)
game was over for a distribution (77:09 - 77:18)
victini's actual pokedex number is 494. (77:12 - 77:20)
it's a good highway but yeah i i (77:18 - 77:22)
personally think they they save the 494 (77:20 - 77:23)
is (77:22 - 77:26)
garbage yeah from bloomington to eagan (77:23 - 77:32)
how exciting is that i was waiting (77:26 - 77:34)
welcome to minneapolis highway cast (77:32 - 77:35)
we're here (77:34 - 77:38)
in slow 485 literally rang on the (77:35 - 77:40)
highway systems (77:38 - 77:43)
[Laughter] (77:40 - 77:45)
hey do you think they put a lot of (77:43 - 77:48)
thought into like (77:45 - 77:51)
the does japan have meme (77:48 - 77:55)
numbers yeah yeah yeah 1000 is important (77:51 - 77:56)
to everybody (77:55 - 77:58)
yeah but i mean they have important (77:56 - 78:00)
numbers like like every culture has (77:58 - 78:02)
important significant numbers like 666 (78:00 - 78:04)
which you would argue is like a number (78:02 - 78:05)
everyone knows (78:04 - 78:07)
the number they played up in digimon as (78:05 - 78:08)
well so they have to (78:07 - 78:11)
that's the it's the wrong number fyi um (78:08 - 78:14)
but they they played up 666 in digimon (78:11 - 78:16)
but uh 666 obviously like (78:14 - 78:19)
devil uh or bad wrong number uh but (78:16 - 78:20)
that's (78:19 - 78:23)
vivian yeah (78:20 - 78:27)
yes the devil bad the devil the devil (78:23 - 78:27)
777 which i would assume (78:28 - 78:33)
japan would also consider be lucky (78:31 - 78:34)
because they got slot machines there (78:33 - 78:35)
right (78:34 - 78:36)
no no that's just us they don't i don't (78:35 - 78:38)
think seven is the same (78:36 - 78:40)
american lucky number yeah seven's a (78:38 - 78:42)
very western seven seven seven ended up (78:40 - 78:42)
being (78:42 - 78:45)
together which maybe they planned that (78:42 - 78:46)
no (78:45 - 78:50)
no it's a pikachu clone (78:46 - 78:50)
they love them they love 150. they love (78:52 - 78:58)
150 and 151 (78:55 - 78:58)
i mean seven is important in chinese (78:59 - 79:03)
numerology i think (79:02 - 79:05)
i think seven is a lucky number in china (79:03 - 79:07)
and in america (79:05 - 79:12)
maybe i i bet they save a thousand for (79:07 - 79:13)
gen 10 though (79:12 - 79:17)
i i bet they said they're going to have (79:13 - 79:18)
another region they're going to do this (79:17 - 79:20)
thing where they do (79:18 - 79:22)
the form so they'll be like they'll (79:20 - 79:23)
introduce 150 (79:22 - 79:27)
pokemon but 60 of them are new forms (79:23 - 79:29)
so that it's technically not getting (79:27 - 79:31)
yeah a thousand which is like (79:29 - 79:35)
so garbage together it would be like a (79:31 - 79:38)
podcast holding off numbering their (79:35 - 79:40)
episodes in a specific way (79:38 - 79:43)
to avoid hitting a major milestone (79:40 - 79:48)
it's that level of garbage um (79:43 - 79:48)
wasn't certain shield just like 16 new (79:48 - 79:52)
pokemon and then it was like (79:50 - 79:56)
20 gallerian yeah how many (79:52 - 79:58)
i mean there's no i don't i don't i'm (79:56 - 80:01)
not a pokemon entomologist here i don't (79:58 - 80:03)
know right right right right these (80:01 - 80:04)
creatures in their forms (80:03 - 80:09)
are the pokemon of the week ologist (80:04 - 80:12)
yes which it's time for you ready for (80:09 - 80:14)
that yeah that was my transition (80:12 - 80:17)
that was smooth (80:14 - 80:22)
last week's pokemon which somebody (80:17 - 80:22)
somebody guessed something and it was (80:23 - 80:29)
like you realize that doesn't fly (80:25 - 80:29)
the key clues were that it has a (80:30 - 80:34)
universe all of its own (80:32 - 80:37)
um you can never meet it unless you have (80:34 - 80:38)
other pokemon (80:37 - 80:41)
in your party uh in (80:38 - 80:43)
unova i like to reference the dream (80:41 - 80:45)
radar because i made extensive use of (80:43 - 80:46)
that for (80:45 - 80:48)
completing my pokedex which was a fun (80:46 - 80:50)
weird 3ds only type (80:48 - 80:53)
thing yes so (80:50 - 80:55)
also one of the pokemon that you can (80:53 - 80:57)
encounter if you're flying (80:55 - 80:58)
around above hoen because there were (80:57 - 81:01)
those random encounters of only flying (80:58 - 81:04)
things that you could come across uh (81:01 - 81:08)
ultra space wilds from alola (81:04 - 81:10)
now you can get it in a dynamax (81:08 - 81:12)
adventure which would really make you (81:10 - 81:14)
think that it's a legendary or uh ultra (81:12 - 81:16)
beast (81:14 - 81:18)
and then i said it's immune to normal (81:16 - 81:19)
fighting and ground which (81:18 - 81:21)
really made it difficult for some people (81:19 - 81:22)
i also said it's (81:21 - 81:25)
sometimes immune to normal fighting and (81:22 - 81:26)
ground which would mean (81:25 - 81:29)
it's not always immune to normal (81:26 - 81:30)
fighting and ground (81:29 - 81:32)
but either ways and then i said some (81:30 - 81:34)
pokemon make use of a mostly (81:32 - 81:36)
light-colored modeled with black and (81:34 - 81:38)
brown globular item that might be given (81:36 - 81:40)
to you apocryphally by striat and city (81:38 - 81:41)
gym leaders (81:40 - 81:42)
alternate forms to swap their attack and (81:41 - 81:44)
defense stats (81:42 - 81:47)
to translate that into common english uh (81:44 - 81:51)
some pokemon use the grizzius orb (81:47 - 81:54)
to which could be given to you by i (81:51 - 81:56)
don't remember who the three bad guys (81:54 - 81:56)
was (81:56 - 81:58)
i knew it last week but i don't remember (81:56 - 81:59)
the shadow (81:58 - 82:03)
triad which some people argued (81:59 - 82:06)
were the striatum city gym leaders yes (82:03 - 82:07)
they are (82:06 - 82:11)
the deep lore and bad fan theory you use (82:07 - 82:14)
the grizziest orb to (82:11 - 82:17)
change the form of what pokemon (82:14 - 82:21)
it's groupie (82:17 - 82:25)
oh a good nice it's (82:21 - 82:28)
giratina look they were people (82:25 - 82:28)
that was my reference it's our beetle (82:29 - 82:35)
yeah they should have named the beatles (82:33 - 82:36)
karupi it's fun (82:35 - 82:38)
it's more fun to say than articuno (82:36 - 82:40)
except skarupi is a (82:38 - 82:42)
scorpion not a beetle not a beetle it (82:40 - 82:43)
has (82:42 - 82:47)
scorpions aren't even insects it has (82:43 - 82:50)
it can sting you i have an abdomen but (82:47 - 82:53)
beetles don't sting they pinch (82:50 - 82:56)
you can pinch and sting at the same time (82:53 - 82:57)
you've got to have a stinger (82:56 - 82:59)
beetles don't have stingers let me say (82:57 - 83:01)
it this way most (82:59 - 83:02)
beetles don't have stingers i can't (83:01 - 83:04)
speak for all beetles because i believe (83:02 - 83:07)
actually out of all creatures on this (83:04 - 83:08)
earth (83:07 - 83:10)
there are actually more beetles than any (83:08 - 83:12)
other type of creature out there but (83:10 - 83:12)
still (83:12 - 83:15)
you made it too easy by saying the orb (83:12 - 83:18)
should have left the orbs i didn't say (83:15 - 83:19)
orb i said globular item (83:18 - 83:22)
yeah globular item (83:19 - 83:26)
uh origin form giratina (83:22 - 83:30)
is the tallest generation four pokemon (83:26 - 83:32)
guarana has many differences from the (83:30 - 83:34)
other members of the trio it is the uh (83:32 - 83:36)
it's the only member with a form (83:34 - 83:39)
uh it is the only member without double (83:36 - 83:40)
resistance (83:39 - 83:42)
it has the highest hp stat rather than (83:40 - 83:44)
special attack (83:42 - 83:46)
it does not have a time space orb in (83:44 - 83:47)
diamond and pearl but it has (83:46 - 83:50)
the the other orb in platinum grizziest (83:47 - 83:52)
grizzius (83:50 - 83:53)
it is met at level 70 in diamond and (83:52 - 83:55)
pearl while the other ones were met at (83:53 - 83:59)
47. this is reversed in platinum (83:55 - 84:02)
uh it is separated by the other members (83:59 - 84:02)
in the group (84:02 - 84:05)
by the in the pokedex by heatran and (84:02 - 84:07)
reggie giggis this is not new i think (84:05 - 84:08)
kiram was also separated (84:07 - 84:12)
um out what that actually mean this is (84:08 - 84:14)
some really dumb pokemon trivia but what (84:12 - 84:15)
that literally means is like in the (84:14 - 84:16)
pokedex (84:15 - 84:18)
like articuno zapdos and mole trace are (84:16 - 84:20)
all next to each other (84:18 - 84:24)
um but like russia ram zekram and kiram (84:20 - 84:25)
are not next to each other because kiram (84:24 - 84:27)
has like two pokemon in between it's the (84:25 - 84:28)
same for (84:27 - 84:31)
dialga palkia and (84:28 - 84:31)
yeah but kobalian varisian and (84:31 - 84:36)
turakian are all nice yeah they are all (84:34 - 84:38)
nice but keldio's not next to them (84:36 - 84:41)
ah ha ha cause kelio came later (84:38 - 84:44)
uh guarantee killed where do we rank the (84:41 - 84:46)
kelvium (84:44 - 84:49)
we cannot we already did (84:46 - 84:53)
we are we are going to do a week-long 23 (84:49 - 84:56)
movie marathon save (84:53 - 84:59)
save it for them okay guarantina is tied (84:56 - 85:00)
with lunala (84:59 - 85:03)
dawn wings necrozma shadow rider (85:00 - 85:05)
calorics of having the highest base stat (85:03 - 85:06)
total of all (85:05 - 85:10)
ghost type pokemon giratino's tied with (85:06 - 85:11)
driftblim of having the highest (85:10 - 85:15)
hp based out of all ghost type pokemon (85:11 - 85:17)
giratina in pokemon platinum giratina is (85:15 - 85:19)
the only pokemon to come out of (85:17 - 85:22)
above the screen with this trivia's out (85:19 - 85:22)
of control (85:22 - 85:25)
yeah this is very this is why hey this (85:22 - 85:27)
this trivia is (85:25 - 85:29)
more than most of the rest of the page (85:27 - 85:31)
uh in pokemon platinum when in the (85:29 - 85:32)
distortion world (85:31 - 85:34)
it does not have a shadow unless it uses (85:32 - 85:35)
a shadow force (85:34 - 85:38)
or breaks out of a pokeball (85:35 - 85:41)
um giratina is the only legendary (85:38 - 85:42)
pokemon that (85:41 - 85:45)
can be obtained in all five generation (85:42 - 85:46)
four (85:45 - 85:50)
core series handheld games well there (85:46 - 85:52)
you go (85:50 - 85:55)
all five okay that would that would be (85:52 - 85:58)
diamond platinum pearl park gold (85:55 - 86:02)
soul silver yes in pokemon heart gold (85:58 - 86:03)
soul silver the second (86:02 - 86:06)
frame jeez jeez (86:03 - 86:09)
the second frame of guarantina's altered (86:06 - 86:10)
form sprite was (86:09 - 86:13)
changed but the static sprite remained (86:10 - 86:15)
the same (86:13 - 86:18)
uh in pokemon platinum when encountering (86:15 - 86:20)
in the distortion world the unique (86:18 - 86:20)
message (86:20 - 86:22)
this distortion world's giratina (86:20 - 86:23)
appeared is displayed (86:22 - 86:26)
however it is still uh considered a wild (86:23 - 86:27)
pokemon (86:26 - 86:31)
in black 2 white 2 in the battle between (86:27 - 86:34)
legendary pokemon fantina has (86:31 - 86:36)
origin form giratina without the (86:34 - 86:40)
gracious orb (86:36 - 86:40)
altered form guaranteeing as the (86:41 - 86:44)
heaviest ghost type pokemon (86:42 - 86:46)
origin form giratina is the tallest (86:44 - 86:50)
ghost type pokemon (86:46 - 86:53)
that's there you go that's a lot how's (86:50 - 86:54)
that shiny (86:53 - 86:57)
it's good but the shiny is sweet the two (86:54 - 87:00)
shuffle icons because it does have two (86:57 - 87:02)
are both very good although i would (87:00 - 87:04)
argue altered form (87:02 - 87:06)
is much more like hey hey we're gonna (87:04 - 87:08)
play we're gonna play (87:06 - 87:11)
and uh origin form is definitely judging (87:08 - 87:13)
you real hard (87:11 - 87:15)
hot take the distortion world is not (87:13 - 87:16)
great it's like three (87:15 - 87:20)
bad rock puzzles and then you're done (87:16 - 87:25)
uh okay most pokemon puzzles (87:20 - 87:25)
most people aren't being like man i love (87:25 - 87:28)
the ice path (87:28 - 87:31)
and getting our gold soul silver which (87:28 - 87:32)
is like (87:31 - 87:34)
let's here question of the week we might (87:32 - 87:36)
have to save this for next week but (87:34 - 87:38)
which is the worst pokemon puzzle out (87:36 - 87:39)
there and i'll give you the answer (87:38 - 87:42)
the thing where you had to use the two (87:39 - 87:44)
types of bikes to get (87:42 - 87:46)
around oh the sky pillar that one's (87:44 - 87:47)
pretty bad (87:46 - 87:49)
i don't have yeah that one's pretty bad (87:47 - 87:51)
dexterity and control (87:49 - 87:54)
sorry worse puzzle (87:51 - 87:58)
the geratina puzzle is so easy though (87:54 - 88:00)
i mean what are we defining as worse (87:58 - 88:02)
like hardest to get past poorly designed (88:00 - 88:05)
just easy i like the ice puzzles i like (88:02 - 88:07)
them a lot (88:05 - 88:10)
like i like that i like was it i like (88:07 - 88:12)
the ice puzzles that you slide and you (88:10 - 88:13)
have to like figure out how to slide (88:12 - 88:15)
right because you have no momentum (88:13 - 88:17)
and i like the ice puzzles where when (88:15 - 88:18)
you step on it (88:17 - 88:21)
it cracks so you can't double step on it (88:18 - 88:23)
i'm a fan of or what about (88:21 - 88:25)
teleport puzzles (88:23 - 88:28)
which gym head those are bad was it are (88:25 - 88:29)
you thinking wolf rick (88:28 - 88:32)
yeah wolf rick well fricks is good (88:29 - 88:35)
with the spinny yeah those i would (88:32 - 88:39)
consider those like mechanical puzzles (88:35 - 88:39)
because you have to like hit a button to (88:40 - 88:44)
change things (88:42 - 88:48)
that's yes yes like claire's gym and (88:44 - 88:50)
heart gold soul silver also one of those (88:48 - 88:51)
where you have to like (88:50 - 88:54)
step on a button to rotate it and then (88:51 - 88:55)
step on a butt another button to make it (88:54 - 88:58)
go left or right (88:55 - 88:58)
all right this week's pokemon okay (89:01 - 89:05)
this is not going to be any fun for greg (89:05 - 89:10)
unfortunately (89:07 - 89:12)
anyone who follows me on snapchat will (89:10 - 89:14)
know the answer to this week's pokemon (89:12 - 89:15)
already (89:14 - 89:18)
but do you know why i am shiny hunting (89:15 - 89:21)
that's pokemon i haven't seen you send (89:18 - 89:23)
me a thing out (89:21 - 89:26)
okay fine you gotta go look at my story (89:23 - 89:27)
and whatever (89:26 - 89:29)
with the announcement of pokemon (89:27 - 89:31)
brilliant diamond (89:29 - 89:34)
and pokemon shining pearl i have decided (89:31 - 89:35)
to begin (89:34 - 89:38)
creating a shiny sinnoh regional (89:35 - 89:41)
pokedex as is widely known (89:38 - 89:44)
i prefer to generate my shiny pokemon (89:41 - 89:46)
the old-fashioned way (89:44 - 89:48)
through breeding at the pokemon nursery (89:46 - 89:50)
in the wild area (89:48 - 89:53)
unfortunately decisions made at the (89:50 - 89:55)
highest levels within the pokemon (89:53 - 89:56)
organization (89:55 - 89:59)
have impacted my ability to accomplish (89:56 - 90:00)
this (89:59 - 90:04)
from sinnoh pokemon number one to twig (90:00 - 90:07)
it turns out only one pokemon evolution (90:04 - 90:08)
line (90:07 - 90:11)
in regional pokedex order before a (90:08 - 90:13)
pokemon evolution line that had been (90:11 - 90:14)
available in an (90:13 - 90:17)
older game appears can be bred (90:14 - 90:21)
using my preferred method even worse (90:17 - 90:24)
if i had started this endeavor prior to (90:21 - 90:25)
june 17 (90:24 - 90:28)
2020 i would have had to begin (90:25 - 90:31)
with magikarp (90:28 - 90:31)
all right well that has (90:32 - 90:38)
been our episode thank you for listening (90:35 - 90:41)
uh this is our last week for our (90:38 - 90:41)
nintendo (90:41 - 90:44)
switch light giveaway i think it ends on (90:41 - 90:46)
the 26th (90:44 - 90:48)
of march if i'm not correct where this (90:46 - 90:49)
podcast comes out on the 22nd (90:48 - 90:52)
i mean it's your contest you can pick (90:49 - 90:53)
and choose whenever you want (90:52 - 90:55)
that's true um so if you want if you're (90:53 - 90:57)
interested in winning a nintendo switch (90:55 - 91:00)
uh the details are on my pin on twitter (90:57 - 91:02)

notes (91:02 - 91:05)
of the podcast completely free to enter (91:03 - 91:08)
and stuff like that (91:05 - 91:11)
uh i am continuing my heart gold (91:08 - 91:14)
soul silver nuzlocke we are on our way (91:11 - 91:17)
to the elite four and uh the plan is to (91:14 - 91:18)
beat the elite for (91:17 - 91:21)
this week so if you are watching on if (91:18 - 91:22)
you are interested in watching the end (91:21 - 91:24)
of that or just hanging out on twitch (91:22 - 91:28)
twitch.tv pkmencast same for instagram (91:24 - 91:29)
same for youtube (91:28 - 91:33)
same for uh tiktok pkmncast (91:29 - 91:37)
i did put out a video on friday talking (91:33 - 91:39)
about if shinies actually (91:37 - 91:44)
matter for games and just (91:39 - 91:48)
the thought process behind that (91:44 - 91:49)
so like a sample would be like people (91:48 - 91:51)
that are like oh if this game doesn't (91:49 - 91:52)
have shine (91:51 - 91:53)
this game didn't do well because it (91:52 - 91:55)
didn't have shinies or (91:53 - 91:57)
um i would be interested in this game if (91:55 - 91:59)
it did have shinies but we can point at (91:57 - 92:01)
games that do exist like pokemon masters (91:59 - 92:01)
which (92:01 - 92:03)
didn't launch with shinies but they (92:01 - 92:05)
added chinese (92:03 - 92:07)
so the question is if you were one of (92:05 - 92:09)
those people saying those two statements (92:07 - 92:11)
did you run out and play pokemon masters (92:09 - 92:12)
when they added chinese (92:11 - 92:17)
the answer you probably didn't um (92:12 - 92:17)
so i did like a 10 minute video on that (92:18 - 92:22)
if you're interested in that (92:21 - 92:25)
conversation on youtube (92:22 - 92:28)
um and i think that's it i think that's (92:25 - 92:29)
our show (92:28 - 92:32)
greg is at white wing on twitter (92:29 - 92:35)
