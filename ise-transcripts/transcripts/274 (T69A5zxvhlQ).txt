[Music] (0:02 - 0:23)
what's up everyone welcome to the 270 (0:20 - 0:26)
fourth episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:23 - 0:30)
it's super effective I am your host s BJ (0:26 - 0:34)
and with me today on this Thursday night (0:30 - 0:35)
when we're recording so hopefully no (0:34 - 0:39)
news comes out this weekend is will yeah (0:35 - 0:41)
that's real scary cuz something real (0:39 - 0:42)
bigs gonna drop this weekend and did you (0:41 - 0:48)
know half of 274 is 137 I didn't a (0:42 - 0:50)
little-known fact yeah (0:48 - 0:52)
so we're recording early because I'm (0:50 - 0:54)
gonna be gone all weekend I get back on (0:52 - 0:57)
Sunday night I'm just going to Minnesota (0:54 - 1:00)
for Irene's family so hopefully nothing (0:57 - 1:05)
drastic or event worthy happens Pokemon (1:00 - 1:07)
news wise over the weekend but I can't (1:05 - 1:09)
imagine so but who knows (1:07 - 1:11)
recording on Thursday night instead of (1:09 - 1:14)
Sunday morning it is myself its will no (1:11 - 1:18)
Travis they are off working the job (1:14 - 1:20)
working the one that pays them with the (1:18 - 1:20)
money (1:20 - 1:23)
the man has them working Oh (1:20 - 1:28)
the man's got us all down I probably (1:23 - 1:31)
would have asked Mycah to be on but I (1:28 - 1:35)
think he's probably exhausted from all (1:31 - 1:37)
the recording and prep work we had to do (1:35 - 1:39)
this week plus all that gourmet cooking (1:37 - 1:42)
that he does all the beautiful meals so (1:39 - 1:44)
if you're a new listener to it's super (1:42 - 1:46)
effective welcome this is a Pokemon (1:44 - 1:48)
podcast I'm gonna do a little bit of (1:46 - 1:50)
housecleaning before we jump in but (1:48 - 1:52)
besides the housecleaning that we're (1:50 - 1:53)
gonna do right off the bat we have some (1:52 - 1:55)
Pokemon news regarding Pokemon God (1:53 - 1:57)
regarding this really weird unknown (1:55 - 2:01)
video that was shown and about xx the (1:57 - 2:03)
Pokemon movie then we got some emails (2:01 - 2:04)
and then we got a Pokemon of the week (2:03 - 2:08)
which we are revamping based on some (2:04 - 2:09)
feedback from our slack community so our (2:08 - 2:11)
Pokemon of the week is gonna be a little (2:09 - 2:13)
bit different really different this time (2:11 - 2:14)
just because there's no Travis I'll fill (2:13 - 2:16)
in the void they're a little bit (2:14 - 2:17)
different Pokemon of the week so stay (2:16 - 2:19)
tuned for that it will be neato King (2:17 - 2:21)
this week probably should start (2:19 - 2:23)
announcing the POC run of the week early (2:21 - 2:25)
I don't know why it's never a secret (2:23 - 2:27)
because it's in the show notes which (2:25 - 2:29)
leads into our housecleaning if you're a (2:27 - 2:32)
new listener or your current listener (2:29 - 2:33)
normally the the first (2:32 - 2:37)
couple minutes of the episode is usually (2:33 - 2:39)
off-topic stuff like what happened in (2:37 - 2:41)
the week that's not Pokemon related and (2:39 - 2:43)
I think that's very important to our (2:41 - 2:44)
show not only because the majority of (2:43 - 2:46)
our listeners liked that segment the (2:44 - 2:49)
best but I think it really does showcase (2:46 - 2:52)
our personalities if you're listening to (2:49 - 2:54)
this most of this Pokemon news you've (2:52 - 2:56)
probably already heard through Twitter (2:54 - 3:00)
or on video game websites or bubble (2:56 - 3:02)
pedia or Sarah B or you know wherever (3:00 - 3:05)
you get news I've always said that most (3:02 - 3:07)
people listening the show don't come to (3:05 - 3:10)
get breaking news they just come to get (3:07 - 3:11)
our opinions on the news that just (3:10 - 3:14)
happens to be a little bit late yeah (3:11 - 3:17)
snarky sassy attitude with your news (3:14 - 3:19)
that's what you get here but the last (3:17 - 3:21)
couple episodes I think the last five or (3:19 - 3:24)
six episodes there are more detailed (3:21 - 3:26)
show notes so if there's a certain (3:24 - 3:29)
segment you don't like to listen to (3:26 - 3:30)
let's say you don't care about Pokemon (3:29 - 3:32)
go let's say you don't care about the (3:30 - 3:35)
Pokemon TCG which we we talk about from (3:32 - 3:36)
time to time maybe you don't like (3:35 - 3:38)
Pokemon of the week you can look at the (3:36 - 3:40)
show notes now and see exactly one (3:38 - 3:42)
segment start and new segments begin so (3:40 - 3:44)
if Pokemon of the week is at you know an (3:42 - 3:47)
hour twenty minutes and housecleaning (3:44 - 3:49)
starts at an hour thirty minutes you (3:47 - 3:51)
know that Pokemon weeks ten minutes long (3:49 - 3:52)
and if that's something you don't care (3:51 - 3:54)
about you could easily skip over that so (3:52 - 3:56)
just that's just for people who have (3:54 - 3:58)
been listening for a long time and or (3:56 - 4:00)
new people that the show notes are more (3:58 - 4:03)
detailed so if that's something you like (4:00 - 4:05)
cool if not you know just continue (4:03 - 4:08)
listening as always well some more (4:05 - 4:09)
housecleaning so the reason Mike is not (4:08 - 4:11)
on and because I said that he's probably (4:09 - 4:14)
exhausted is because we just launched a (4:11 - 4:15)
new podcast together (4:14 - 4:18)
did you really we did I think I (4:15 - 4:22)
completely missed that yeah I know (4:18 - 4:26)
you're you're you haven't well you know (4:22 - 4:30)
I'm lying yeah I was the first person to (4:26 - 4:34)
love it we launched a monster hunter (4:30 - 4:36)
podcast this is something that I've (4:34 - 4:38)
wanted to do for for quite a long time (4:36 - 4:41)
I'm a huge huge monster hunter fan and I (4:38 - 4:45)
probably talk slash read about Monster (4:41 - 4:46)
Hunter more than I actually play it (4:45 - 4:47)
which (4:46 - 4:49)
kind of how Pokemon is for me I podcast (4:47 - 4:52)
and and read about Pokemon more than I (4:49 - 4:55)
then I get to play it Mike and I've (4:52 - 4:57)
wanted a podcast for awhile it's it's (4:55 - 4:58)
really convenient that we live very (4:57 - 5:00)
close to each other I I have so much (4:58 - 5:02)
audio gear and so much audio setup that (5:00 - 5:05)
it's appealing to be able to sit in a (5:02 - 5:07)
room with people or in this case one (5:05 - 5:10)
other person podcast together I know I (5:07 - 5:11)
wanted to I knew I wanted to do a (5:10 - 5:13)
Monster Hunter podcast and I knew that (5:11 - 5:15)
the last couple months wasn't the right (5:13 - 5:18)
time to do that I don't even I wouldn't (5:15 - 5:19)
even say that when generations launched (5:18 - 5:22)
last fall I wouldn't even say that that (5:19 - 5:25)
was the right time to do it and I kind (5:22 - 5:27)
of missed the boat when if master (5:25 - 5:30)
hundred for you was was hot but now with (5:27 - 5:32)
Monster Hunter world coming out early (5:30 - 5:36)
2018 and with it being on ps4 and PC and (5:32 - 5:39)
Xbox one I think it's a really great (5:36 - 5:41)
time to start building that community of (5:39 - 5:44)
hunters and both Myka and I plan to (5:41 - 5:47)
import double cross which is a the (5:44 - 5:51)
expansion quote-unquote expansion two (5:47 - 5:53)
generations except it will only be you (5:51 - 5:56)
it will only be in Japanese so we'll (5:53 - 5:59)
have to finagle through that but with (5:56 - 6:01)
double cross coming out next month and (5:59 - 6:03)
the big game Monster Hunter 5 aka (6:01 - 6:05)
Monster Hunter world coming out early (6:03 - 6:08)
2018 I think I think it's a perfect (6:05 - 6:10)
opportunity to start building that (6:08 - 6:13)
community and being able to be a (6:10 - 6:15)
resource to welcome new hunters or know (6:13 - 6:16)
new people that are interested in (6:15 - 6:19)
Monster Hunter and so there are three (6:16 - 6:21)
episodes out in iTunes and SoundCloud (6:19 - 6:24)

wherever in Google Play and wherever you (6:24 - 6:29)

find it on any of those cert (6:32 - 6:37)
services by searching the carve or by (6:34 - 6:38)

enjoy Monster Hunter (6:50 - 6:54)
well then uh thanks for sitting through (6:51 - 6:57)
two minutes of me telling you about it (6:54 - 7:00)
now it's a good podcast even if you like (6:57 - 7:01)
have (7:00 - 7:03)
played monster hunter before because (7:01 - 7:05)
it's kind of just talking about like (7:03 - 7:08)
what does monster hunter mean to me and (7:05 - 7:11)
what has that his not to me because I (7:08 - 7:13)
wasn't invited to be part of this even (7:11 - 7:15)
though I play monster hunter every (7:13 - 7:17)
single day but like about the history of (7:15 - 7:20)
Monster Hunter so far and like what (7:17 - 7:21)
versions there have been and where (7:20 - 7:24)
they've been and like I like Micah's (7:21 - 7:26)
heartwarming stories about him and his (7:24 - 7:29)
brother and it's about family and love (7:26 - 7:31)
and killing things and chopping them up (7:29 - 7:33)
and using their parts to make armor and (7:31 - 7:37)
weapons I'm I am sure there will be an (7:33 - 7:41)
opportunity for for will to be on when I (7:37 - 7:43)
was originally like I said earlier I (7:41 - 7:46)
think there there is a different kind of (7:43 - 7:49)
dynamic and a different feel when two (7:46 - 7:50)
people are sitting in the same room I (7:49 - 7:52)
suppose to what we do here it's a (7:50 - 7:55)
perfective which three of us are in (7:52 - 7:58)
different states recording and not (7:55 - 8:00)
seeing each other and and I think I do a (7:58 - 8:02)
pretty good job of making that show or (8:00 - 8:04)
the show sound sound alright and feel (8:02 - 8:06)
good and apparently you guys like it (8:04 - 8:08)
that's why you're here but I just wanted (8:06 - 8:10)
to take a moment and talk about Monster (8:08 - 8:12)
Hunter and to everyone who has (8:10 - 8:13)
downloaded and listened to it thank you (8:12 - 8:14)
so much (8:13 - 8:17)
I can't kinda it's it's weird going from (8:14 - 8:21)
like zero like a zero base of like okay (8:17 - 8:22)
we have no episodes we have this brand (8:21 - 8:25)
new Twitter we have we don't have a (8:22 - 8:27)
website yet and I'm working on that and (8:25 - 8:30)
kind of building that up and starting (8:27 - 8:32)
all over again because at the end of the (8:30 - 8:34)
month it's super effective will be seven (8:32 - 8:37)
years old seven years old seven does (8:34 - 8:39)
that mean seven years old I was in my (8:37 - 8:43)
30s from when you started old man will (8:39 - 8:47)
over here let's jump into some Pokemon (8:43 - 8:52)
news first bit of news will you're going (8:47 - 8:55)
to Pokemon go fast this is very true I (8:52 - 8:58)
am going to I mean I don't want to say (8:55 - 9:01)
it again but but you know what I'm gonna (8:58 - 9:05)
Chicago - Pokemon go fast haha that's (9:01 - 9:08)
bad that's bad as is the city of Chicago (9:05 - 9:11)
but I will make the sacrifice of going (9:08 - 9:14)
there once again to celebrate Pokemon go (9:11 - 9:15)
fast (9:14 - 9:18)
as I speculated earlier my sister no (9:15 - 9:20)
longer wandered her ticket so it was (9:18 - 9:23)
either sell the ticket for I don't even (9:20 - 9:25)
know how much they're going for probably (9:23 - 9:26)
still three to four hundred dollars I'm (9:25 - 9:29)
assuming I haven't checked but let's (9:26 - 9:30)
just pretend that they're still going (9:29 - 9:32)
for three to four hundred dollars on (9:30 - 9:34)
eBay or I could give that ticket to you (9:32 - 9:37)
and make no money wait a minute I gave (9:34 - 9:38)
you five hundred dollars for that ticket (9:37 - 9:41)
you don't lied in the pentacle and I (9:38 - 9:42)
can't believe you sold it to me for five (9:41 - 9:43)
hundred dollars when it was only worth (9:42 - 9:46)
three hundred dollars on eBay somebody (9:43 - 9:49)
if somebody asked the I don't know I was (9:46 - 9:51)
going with hey wait for this podcast to (9:49 - 9:55)

I haven't seen once last time we saw (9:55 - 9:59)
each other December what's it really (9:57 - 10:02)
that long ago yeah and it's funny cuz (9:59 - 10:05)
like had three weeks after Pokemon go (10:02 - 10:06)
fest we'll be seeing each other again (10:05 - 10:11)
yeah that's real sad too no that's true (10:06 - 10:13)
cuz I usually do like a spring trip to (10:11 - 10:17)
the area and yeah I didn't this year but (10:13 - 10:19)
time has been going by so fast yeah (10:17 - 10:21)
2017 s been flying by because you're (10:19 - 10:23)
coming to Pokemon go fest you probably (10:21 - 10:25)
care about the Pokemon code news that (10:23 - 10:28)
dropped recently so we'll go over this (10:25 - 10:31)
real quick here this is the press (10:28 - 10:33)
release I got on the antic and the (10:31 - 10:35)
Pokemon company international have (10:33 - 10:38)
unveiled the new details for Pokemon (10:35 - 10:40)
goes global events and real world (10:38 - 10:43)
activities for trainers around the world (10:40 - 10:45)
to participate together Pokemon go fest (10:43 - 10:47)
Chicago will feature a variety of (10:45 - 10:50)
activities for trainers including unique (10:47 - 10:53)
ways for players at the event and across (10:50 - 10:56)
the globe to work together to compete (10:53 - 10:58)
unique challenges and earn special (10:56 - 11:01)
in-game rewards so if you're not going (10:58 - 11:04)
to put more go fest still some rewards (11:01 - 11:07)
for you here still some team work to do (11:04 - 11:11)
on July 22nd so do I need to bring a (11:07 - 11:13)
smartphone to Pokemon go fest (11:11 - 11:16)
you would you know I was thinking what (11:13 - 11:21)
if somebody like me or anyone else let's (11:16 - 11:22)
just say they're from California though (11:21 - 11:24)
like the longest possible distance in (11:22 - 11:27)
the United States to travel from maybe (11:24 - 11:28)
Washington (11:27 - 11:31)
but they've booked a hotel room they (11:28 - 11:33)
booked a flight they fly all the way out (11:31 - 11:35)
to Pokemon go fast they get through the (11:33 - 11:39)
gate with their wristband and their (11:35 - 11:41)
iPhone or their Android device or (11:39 - 11:43)
whatever they're using just completely (11:41 - 11:46)
dies I don't know if I'm more horrified (11:43 - 11:48)
by your story or the fact that you (11:46 - 11:50)
forgot that like Micronesia is part of (11:48 - 11:52)
the United States so I'm thinking cuz (11:50 - 11:54)
I'm an iPhone user that okay what if (11:52 - 11:58)
this happens to me I know that the north (11:54 - 12:01)
of Michigan Avenue Apple store is what (11:58 - 12:04)
2025 minutes walking distance from Grant (12:01 - 12:06)
Park all right now that only takes me (12:04 - 12:08)
about 15 to 17 minutes you got longer (12:06 - 12:11)
legs now that's true so you walk over (12:08 - 12:14)
there and because I used to work at an (12:11 - 12:14)
Apple Store (12:14 - 12:16)
they're probably gonna make you wait one (12:14 - 12:20)
to two hours to get a new phone but no (12:16 - 12:22)
book your genius appointment before you (12:20 - 12:27)
leave them your phone's dead it's DOA (12:22 - 12:30)
that's right that was arrival is there (12:27 - 12:33)
an AT&T store somewhere nearby there (12:30 - 12:34)
that they're not gonna fix your iPhone (12:33 - 12:38)
I'm just I'm that would be extremely (12:34 - 12:42)
tragic to travel all the way to this (12:38 - 12:44)
one-day only event where you have to (12:42 - 12:48)
depend on a device and not everyone has (12:44 - 12:50)
two phones like you do will well I was (12:48 - 12:52)
actually just gonna ask should I bring (12:50 - 12:55)
some of my extra iPhones for people (12:52 - 12:59)
maybe because that's a question that (12:55 - 13:01)
people ask I've only got like five or (12:59 - 13:03)
six of them I was thinking about (13:01 - 13:05)
bringing my iPad and an iPod touch that (13:03 - 13:07)
I have just lying around just so if my (13:05 - 13:10)
phone did die for any odd reason I could (13:07 - 13:12)
at least use those devices and connect (13:10 - 13:15)
to Wi-Fi and I don't know it just I I am (13:12 - 13:19)
sure out of the 12,000 plus tickets (13:15 - 13:22)
Pokemon go has sold I bet one person (13:19 - 13:24)
will at least one person will have this (13:22 - 13:26)
issue they get two Pokemon go fest and (13:24 - 13:29)
their phone does not work and they don't (13:26 - 13:31)
have another solution there will be (13:29 - 13:32)
people who show up and completely have (13:31 - 13:35)
forgotten their phone at home absolutely (13:32 - 13:37)
I don't know about the Hat okay hey let (13:35 - 13:39)
me continue continue with his press (13:37 - 13:41)
release here in addition to Pokemon go (13:39 - 13:42)
fest (13:41 - 13:44)
Mainers in Europe will have the chance (13:42 - 13:47)
to team up this summer across seven (13:44 - 13:49)
cities during what is called Pokemon go (13:47 - 13:53)
safari zone events they can catch rare (13:49 - 13:56)
Pokemon obtain special rewards and take (13:53 - 13:59)
on powerful raid bosses Pokemon go Fest (13:56 - 14:01)
will take place on Saturday July 22nd in (13:59 - 14:05)
Grant Park located in the heart of (14:01 - 14:07)
downtown Chicago Oh another side note I (14:05 - 14:08)
was supposed to say this in (14:07 - 14:11)
housecleaning but if you are planning on (14:08 - 14:15)
going to Pokemon go fest or you are just (14:11 - 14:17)
in the Chicago area so you don't have (14:15 - 14:19)
tickets but you do want to attend some (14:17 - 14:22)
sort of Pokemon podcast Meetup (14:19 - 14:27)
I am getting a a soft head count for who (14:22 - 14:29)
might be interested in that ideally what (14:27 - 14:32)
I would like to do is book a nearby (14:29 - 14:34)
restaurant and I know there's I know (14:32 - 14:36)
it's it's at Chicago so either (14:34 - 14:38)
everything's expensive or everything's (14:36 - 14:41)
too far away but that's why I need the (14:38 - 14:44)
head count because if we get you know 35 (14:41 - 14:48)
people and the room costs let me do (14:44 - 14:50)
simpler math if we get 30 people in the (14:48 - 14:55)
room costs $600 to reserve you have to (14:50 - 14:57)
spend $600 in food to you know actually (14:55 - 14:59)
reserve that room that comes down to (14:57 - 15:02)
about 20 dollars a person but you're (14:59 - 15:04)
you're spending that money on drinks and (15:02 - 15:07)
food and dessert or whatever so if I get (15:04 - 15:09)
a head count of how many we have that's (15:07 - 15:13)
ideally brings down the cost so again (15:09 - 15:14)
I'm trying to find a restaurant because (15:13 - 15:16)
at least for the people that will be at (15:14 - 15:17)
Pokemon go fest (15:16 - 15:20)
we're gonna be outside all day we're (15:17 - 15:22)
going to probably be eating not so good (15:20 - 15:25)
food that is extremely overpriced and (15:22 - 15:28)
one seven o'clock hits it's going to be (15:25 - 15:30)
a disaster to try to leave that area car (15:28 - 15:33)
wise and so the simplest thing is let's (15:30 - 15:35)
go to a restaurant that is in walking (15:33 - 15:38)
distance let's sit down and get some (15:35 - 15:42)
better cooked food and let's make sure (15:38 - 15:44)
that space is air conditioning and that (15:42 - 15:48)
space is only for us so it's private and (15:44 - 15:51)
so if that ends up costing you know 10 (15:48 - 15:54)
to 15 dollars a person I'd rather have (15:51 - 15:55)
that then (15:54 - 15:58)
let's not have a place to go and stand (15:55 - 16:00)
outside and be hot and sweaty and some (15:58 - 16:02)
of us will be hungry and some of us are (16:00 - 16:04)
not and I'm not saying that if you're (16:02 - 16:05)
coming you have to spend 10 to 15 a (16:04 - 16:07)
person I'm just saying that if I get a (16:05 - 16:10)
head count I can secure a room and then (16:07 - 16:11)
we don't have to worry about that cost (16:10 - 16:14)
yeah agreed and you just reminded me (16:11 - 16:17)
that I know someone who is somewhat (16:14 - 16:20)
influential from Chicago and let me ask (16:17 - 16:22)
that person for some recommendations as (16:20 - 16:25)
well that would be great because the the (16:22 - 16:28)
rooms that Irene have has found it come (16:25 - 16:30)
with with the head count we have we have (16:28 - 16:34)
of about 25 people resort with that say (16:30 - 16:36)
they are they're coming so that comes to (16:34 - 16:41)
about $20 ish but I wasn't big on that (16:36 - 16:42)
restaurant to begin with so anyways this (16:41 - 16:45)
is this is for people in the Chicago (16:42 - 16:46)
area so don't spend too much time on it (16:45 - 16:49)
but if you're interested in coming even (16:46 - 16:50)
if you're not if you're interested in (16:49 - 16:52)
meeting other it's super effective fans (16:50 - 16:55)
and myself and will and Myka and Irene (16:52 - 16:58)
and the community we have just check our (16:55 - 17:00)
Twitter or check our facebook or check (16:58 - 17:02)
slack just fill out the form all I'm (17:00 - 17:05)
asking is an email if you're going to (17:02 - 17:05)
the fest (17:05 - 17:07)
if you're coming to the after party if (17:05 - 17:09)
you're interested in eating or not and I (17:07 - 17:10)
like I said before if you're not (17:09 - 17:13)
interested in eating no big deal and how (17:10 - 17:15)
many people are in your party so if if (17:13 - 17:18)
you are bringing a significant other or (17:15 - 17:20)
a friend we just want to know a rough (17:18 - 17:22)
headcount if you fill out the form and (17:20 - 17:23)
you decide you can't make it it's (17:22 - 17:25)
honestly no big deal again just looking (17:23 - 17:29)
for a rough headcount I and I'll be that (17:25 - 17:30)
will also be in the show notes that link (17:29 - 17:33)
it's just a Google Form and that will (17:30 - 17:35)
also be like like I said on Twitter and (17:33 - 17:36)
stuff so if you could fill that out as (17:35 - 17:38)
soon as possible that'd be great because (17:36 - 17:40)
we have a kind of finalize things the (17:38 - 17:42)
day after or so this episode comes out (17:40 - 17:46)
back to this Pokemon go Fest will take (17:42 - 17:49)
place Saturday in Grant Park located in (17:46 - 17:51)
downtown Chicago throughout the day (17:49 - 17:53)
trainers will be able to participate in (17:51 - 17:56)
three challenge window activities where (17:53 - 17:58)
they must work together to catch certain (17:56 - 18:00)
types of Pokemon in order to well unlock (17:58 - 18:02)
a variety of perks for Pokemon go (18:00 - 18:03)
players around the world (18:02 - 18:06)
trainers outside of Chicago will be able (18:03 - 18:08)
to participate in the festivities by (18:06 - 18:09)
catching as many (18:08 - 18:10)
Pokemon as possible during these (18:09 - 18:13)
challenge windows to extend the duration (18:10 - 18:17)
of bonuses unlocked by the attendees of (18:13 - 18:20)
Pokemon go fest if trainers around the (18:17 - 18:22)
world catch enough Pokemon a mystery (18:20 - 18:24)
challenge will be revealed that Pokemon (18:22 - 18:27)
go fast you two I'm assuming it has to (18:24 - 18:29)
be Mewtwo for the potential to unlock an (18:27 - 18:32)
extra special bonus across the globe (18:29 - 18:34)
which as I'm assuming for everyone else (18:32 - 18:36)
Mewtwo raids but who knows (18:34 - 18:38)
so wait they've got a we've got to (18:36 - 18:40)
unlock some things that they can then (18:38 - 18:43)
extend the unlock something and if they (18:40 - 18:45)
do that well enough it unlocks something (18:43 - 18:48)
for us which we then have to do succeed (18:45 - 18:50)
at which will then unlock for them (18:48 - 18:53)
that's exactly correct this is a huge (18:50 - 18:56)
burden I'm not coming anymore in Europe (18:53 - 18:58)
Pokemon go safari zone events will be (18:56 - 19:02)
hosted at select shopping centers (18:58 - 19:06)
Copenhagen and Prague on August 5th (19:02 - 19:09)
Stockholm and Amsterdam on August 12th (19:06 - 19:13)
and oberhaussen Harris and Barcelona on (19:09 - 19:16)
September 16th Pokemon goes safari zone (19:13 - 19:18)
events will give trainers the (19:16 - 19:20)
opportunity to catch a variety of (19:18 - 19:22)
Pokemon from special Kanto region and (19:20 - 19:25)
Johto region zones including Pokemon (19:22 - 19:28)
ever encountered in Europe you didn't (19:25 - 19:29)
see the image they used (19:28 - 19:32)
kangaskhan was on top of Europe so the (19:29 - 19:35)
obvious one of the obvious Pokemon that (19:32 - 19:37)
would be encountered would be kangaskhan (19:35 - 19:39)
which currently right now is exclusive (19:37 - 19:41)
to the Australian region players will (19:39 - 19:43)
also have a chance to team up with (19:41 - 19:46)
others to take on unique and powerful (19:43 - 19:48)
raid bosses I'm assuming again this is (19:46 - 19:50)
legendary because they used the word (19:48 - 19:53)
unique and powerful I wouldn't consider (19:50 - 19:55)
any of the rates currently unique (19:53 - 19:56)
because they've been around for three (19:55 - 20:00)
weeks now more powerful ah some of them (19:56 - 20:01)
are tough terrain Atari I think is the (20:00 - 20:04)
toughest right now so I've been catching (20:01 - 20:07)
lots of Pokemon doing the best I can to (20:04 - 20:09)
lead up to this Pokemon go fast event (20:07 - 20:12)
but I'm only level 16 am I going to be (20:09 - 20:15)
able to have fun yeah I think so I mean (20:12 - 20:18)
though the minimum rate level is level 5 (20:15 - 20:22)
so you can still raid you can still hit (20:18 - 20:22)
up (20:22 - 20:23)
poka stops I'm sure there will be tons (20:22 - 20:27)
of lers and incense and everything (20:23 - 20:28)
happening there (20:27 - 20:33)
I have no worry that you wouldn't be on (20:28 - 20:35)
the same playing field as other pokemon (20:33 - 20:38)
go players all right I do I have to (20:35 - 20:40)
bring my own lures lures is a word (20:38 - 20:42)
that's spoken with two syllable lures (20:40 - 20:46)
probably bring my lures every time you (20:42 - 20:48)
level up you get more like you get (20:46 - 20:50)
fruity ones like I think when you hit (20:48 - 20:52)
level 20 you get three or four free ooh (20:50 - 20:55)
cuz I usually the way I walk I passed by (20:52 - 20:57)
one okay stop twice in the morning so I (20:55 - 21:00)
usually set a lure there when the first (20:57 - 21:02)
time I pass it in the night pickup the (21:00 - 21:05)
rewards on them an ex pass around mmm I (21:02 - 21:07)
would save your lures for the fest all (21:05 - 21:09)
future lures will now be saved for the (21:07 - 21:11)
fest but that's how I got a growlithe (21:09 - 21:14)
the Pokemon company will also be hosting (21:11 - 21:16)
an annual Pikachu outbreak event in (21:14 - 21:19)
Yokohama Yokohama sorry Japan from (21:16 - 21:21)
August 9th through the 15th where a (21:19 - 21:24)
special Pokemon go experience will take (21:21 - 21:27)
place more details of the event will be (21:24 - 21:32)
revealed soon and that is your Pokemon (21:27 - 21:35)
Go news well no I've got Pokemon Go news (21:32 - 21:39)
I caught a Pikachu with the hat on it at (21:35 - 21:42)
Washington Circle this morning ash (21:39 - 21:46)
hat Pikachu yes I caught one of those at (21:42 - 21:47)
Washington Circle (21:46 - 21:49)
I recommend anybody who's desperate for (21:47 - 21:51)
Pokemon go action just take a walk down (21:49 - 21:54)
Pennsylvania Avenue between the Four (21:51 - 21:56)
Seasons Hotel and the White House you (21:54 - 21:58)
get all the Pokemon go you need there's (21:56 - 22:01)
like thirty gyms and 400 focus tops I'm (21:58 - 22:04)
uh I've heard I've heard on the street (22:01 - 22:06)
by the street I mean the internet that (22:04 - 22:10)
mareep is pretty common in Washington DC (22:06 - 22:13)
and not common really anywhere else but (22:10 - 22:16)
your area I have not seen a single (22:13 - 22:19)
mareep but I have probably caught a (22:16 - 22:22)
thousand not twos it was a there was a (22:19 - 22:23)
Zhou to you on Pennsylvania Avenue this (22:22 - 22:25)
morning and I did catch that as well I (22:23 - 22:28)
like I said I've heard mareep is in your (22:25 - 22:31)
area but I know as of recording this (22:28 - 22:33)
these spawns just changed they did a (22:31 - 22:36)
spawn refresh so if you're (22:33 - 22:39)
you know used to seeing I don't know (22:36 - 22:41)
piggies piggies are gonna be there (22:39 - 22:42)
regardless if you're used to seeing like (22:41 - 22:44)
main keys in your area it's possible (22:42 - 22:46)
that you may now be seeing like (22:44 - 22:47)
Sandshrew or something like that (22:46 - 22:50)
I am now seeing drowsy at my house and I (22:47 - 22:53)
haven't seen drowsy in my house in in (22:50 - 22:55)
like the past eight months I think we (22:53 - 22:58)
have one more podcast before Pokemon go (22:55 - 23:03)
Fest it yes wait no no this is the last (22:58 - 23:06)
known yes so again fill out that form we (23:03 - 23:09)
will be at pokemon go fest we will be (23:06 - 23:09)
there all day (23:09 - 23:12)
fill out the form if you are at least in (23:09 - 23:13)
the Chicago area and you plan on (23:12 - 23:16)
attending the Meetup like I said the (23:13 - 23:17)
meetup will be after seven o'clock (23:16 - 23:19)
because there are these events that are (23:17 - 23:22)
going on throughout the festival so I (23:19 - 23:24)
don't want I don't want to waste your (23:22 - 23:27)
guys's time if you're there not really (23:24 - 23:28)
waste but you know you're there for the (23:27 - 23:30)
event I want you to have the most fun (23:28 - 23:33)
that you can have at the event you (23:30 - 23:35)
should probably talk about the what the (23:33 - 23:37)
unlocks could possibly be no we should (23:35 - 23:39)
talk about whether it's worthwhile for (23:37 - 23:41)
people to stand on the outside of Grant (23:39 - 23:42)
Park and think that they're gonna be (23:41 - 23:45)
able to participate in them that's (23:42 - 23:47)
happening there's something to do with (23:45 - 23:49)
the bracelets that they tie to your (23:47 - 23:52)
trainer ID so I think that matters in in (23:49 - 23:55)
some aspects to the there are the three (23:52 - 23:58)
challenge windows so at Chicago you have (23:55 - 24:01)
11 to 11:30 12:00 to 12:30 and 3:00 to (23:58 - 24:02)
3:30 (24:01 - 24:04)
so there are 30-minute challenge windows (24:02 - 24:07)
for Chicago there are six different (24:04 - 24:10)
challenges but I believe for my (24:07 - 24:13)
understanding is you can only unlock one (24:10 - 24:16)
challenge her to the 30 minutes so even (24:13 - 24:17)
though there are six challenges the (24:16 - 24:21)
Chicago players can only unlock three of (24:17 - 24:24)
the six so during those windows you can (24:21 - 24:27)
catch if you catch enough fire pokemon (24:24 - 24:31)
you'll unlock a candy bonus if you catch (24:27 - 24:34)
enough water pokemon you unlock an XP (24:31 - 24:37)
bonus Reddit and Twitter seems to care (24:34 - 24:40)
about this one if you catch the enough (24:37 - 24:42)
grass pokemon you will unlock a Stardust (24:40 - 24:44)
bonus and I have kind of a complain (24:42 - 24:46)
about that but I'll get back to that if (24:44 - 24:49)
you collect enough electric pokemon that (24:46 - 24:49)
is an egg (24:49 - 24:53)
distance bonus I think it's just the (24:49 - 24:55)
more you walk the faster it is the hatch (24:53 - 24:58)
eggs you catch enough rock pokemon (24:55 - 25:01)
ground ground a rock I can't tell with (24:58 - 25:04)
this pixelated some bling it's the worst (25:01 - 25:05)
one it doesn't matter it's the Buddy (25:04 - 25:08)
distance bonus and then if you collect (25:05 - 25:10)
enough normal Pokemon that is an (25:08 - 25:12)
encounter rate bonus which I believe you (25:10 - 25:15)
just get more encounters if I'm not (25:12 - 25:17)
mistaken and then worldwide (25:15 - 25:21)
there's bronze silver and gold if it's (25:17 - 25:24)
bronze that increases the duration of (25:21 - 25:26)
the bonus by 24 hours if it's silver (25:24 - 25:28)
that's 48 hours and if it's gold you (25:26 - 25:30)
unlock the mystery challenge the mystery (25:28 - 25:33)
challenge if that is successful which I (25:30 - 25:35)
have to imagine has to be successful (25:33 - 25:38)
like there's no way that this is going (25:35 - 25:42)
to be a festival Plaza goal where the (25:38 - 25:46)
first two were unreachable oh it very (25:42 - 25:49)
well could be no no no because if this (25:46 - 25:51)
is the summer of legendary and the (25:49 - 25:53)
legendary Pokemon and they haven't done (25:51 - 25:54)
legendary Pokemon yet and they plan to (25:53 - 25:57)
loo do legendary Pokemon here it would (25:54 - 26:00)
make it seem like they want the goal to (25:57 - 26:02)
be obtainable so then you get people (26:00 - 26:05)
talking and you get people excited and (26:02 - 26:08)
clearly they want people to stay until (26:05 - 26:10)
six o'clock since from six to seven the (26:08 - 26:12)
mystery challenge will be available if (26:10 - 26:17)
it's succeeded and then if the Chicago (26:12 - 26:18)
people can succeed at the mystery (26:17 - 26:21)
challenge it would unlock the global (26:18 - 26:24)
reward for everyone which takes place on (26:21 - 26:27)
July 23rd and July 24th again we don't (26:24 - 26:30)
know what that is but going back to the (26:27 - 26:30)
Stardust (26:30 - 26:33)
I just want to complain real quick that (26:30 - 26:35)
all these hardcore Pokemon players on (26:33 - 26:38)
Reddit and Twitter and forums and (26:35 - 26:41)
Facebook they want more Stardust (26:38 - 26:43)
and the reason you would you start us is (26:41 - 26:46)
the level up your Pokemon and the old (26:43 - 26:48)
gym system used to give Stardust and (26:46 - 26:50)
when there's like adventure week or fire (26:48 - 26:53)
a nice week there's Stardust bonuses and (26:50 - 26:55)
the more you give candy to a Pokemon the (26:53 - 26:57)
more Stardust it requires the level of (26:55 - 27:01)
Pokemon my complaint is I get that (26:57 - 27:03)
people want to (27:01 - 27:06)
we're up there Pokemon but by giving (27:03 - 27:10)
everyone more Stardust it's going to (27:06 - 27:14)
stag it nothing changes and what I mean (27:10 - 27:17)
by that is oh now I have you know 40,000 (27:14 - 27:20)
Stardust and I can level up my golem an (27:17 - 27:23)
extra 500 CP yeah but so does your (27:20 - 27:25)
neighbor and so does everyone else (27:23 - 27:27)
playing they get they're all getting (27:25 - 27:29)
more Stardust and you're getting more (27:27 - 27:31)
Stardust and then instead of everyone's (27:29 - 27:33)
pokemon being let's just say everyone's (27:31 - 27:35)
pokemons at 1200 okay then in two days (27:33 - 27:38)
everyone's Pokemon is at 1500 so nothing (27:35 - 27:41)
changes it's just everyone's numbers (27:38 - 27:44)
went up higher and it's the same but (27:41 - 27:45)
it's not everyone it's only the people (27:44 - 27:47)
at Pokemon go fast you get the stardust (27:45 - 27:48)
bonus (27:47 - 27:50)
yeah but then in terms that would apply (27:48 - 27:53)
to everyone you're saying that a rising (27:50 - 27:57)
tide raises all boats right so no boat (27:53 - 27:59)
gets to be better than any other boat (27:57 - 28:02)
exactly and there's nothing you hate (27:59 - 28:06)
more than not being able to win no it's (28:02 - 28:09)
not even about winning it's just I would (28:06 - 28:11)
rather see for me I would I guess I (28:09 - 28:13)
would rather see like an encounter a (28:11 - 28:15)
bonus because that gives me more of a (28:13 - 28:17)
chance to possibly catch pokemon I don't (28:15 - 28:20)
have I would rather see something like (28:17 - 28:22)
an egg distance bonus because if I can (28:20 - 28:24)
go through eggs faster and I'm at the (28:22 - 28:26)
event and they're giving out more eggs (28:24 - 28:28)
and I'm planning on walking all day I (28:26 - 28:30)
think that bonus is really valuable I (28:28 - 28:32)
would rather get a candy bonus because (28:30 - 28:34)
there's a lot of Pokemon I have and the (28:32 - 28:36)
only thing I am missing is candy and I (28:34 - 28:38)
would rather fill out my pokedex at that (28:36 - 28:41)
point but Stardust bonus I have had zero (28:38 - 28:45)
issues taking over a gym if I go to a (28:41 - 28:47)
gym down the street and there it's a (28:45 - 28:51)
valor gym and there's 2,900 Pokemon in (28:47 - 28:54)
there which no one wants 3,000 Seabee (28:51 - 28:56)
Pokemon because of how they are how they (28:54 - 28:59)
work in gyms so if they're at 2999 right (28:56 - 29:02)
before 3000 and they're sitting in gyms (28:59 - 29:05)
there is nothing that is going to stop (29:02 - 29:08)
me from taking that gym solo even though (29:05 - 29:10)
my max Pokemon I think is my train car (29:08 - 29:14)
which is 6,000 2,600 as long as I sit (29:10 - 29:16)
there at that gym I will eventually take (29:14 - 29:16)
it (29:16 - 29:19)
it might take me you know 20 revives and (29:16 - 29:22)
20 hyper potions but it doesn't like I (29:19 - 29:23)
said last week it doesn't matter if the (29:22 - 29:26)
gym is full of Pokemon at 500 CP or if (29:23 - 29:30)
the gym is at 2,900 CP you can still (29:26 - 29:32)
solo it it's just gonna take you a (29:30 - 29:34)
little longer and if you're with a group (29:32 - 29:35)
if you're with one another person it (29:34 - 29:39)
just goes twice as fast for me to wanna (29:35 - 29:43)
star dust reward to power up Pokemon (29:39 - 29:45)
when CP at this point in the game (29:43 - 29:46)
doesn't matter at all (29:45 - 29:49)
it's just it feels like that is a wasted (29:46 - 29:54)
reward my highest CP Pokemon is 695 and (29:49 - 29:57)
you could do raids just fine with that (29:54 - 29:59)
and you could do gems just fine with (29:57 - 29:59)
that (29:59 - 30:03)
it's a wheezing I don't want to can I (29:59 - 30:05)
give it Stardust to make it better you (30:03 - 30:08)
can but I wouldn't because there's no (30:05 - 30:11)
point like even if you're doing a raid (30:08 - 30:15)
and you have one 600 CP and a bunch of (30:11 - 30:18)
500 CPS and let's say you're doing a try (30:15 - 30:20)
an ATAR so one of the hardest raids and (30:18 - 30:22)
you're in there with 19 other people (30:20 - 30:25)
you're still as long as Tyranitar is (30:22 - 30:27)
defeated even if you're out if even if (30:25 - 30:29)
all six Pokemon of yours get defeated (30:27 - 30:31)
you are allowed to jump back in with a (30:29 - 30:34)
new six and the raid keeps going the (30:31 - 30:37)
only contest in the raid is the time (30:34 - 30:39)
itself can you beat the timer because (30:37 - 30:41)
even if all six of your Pokemon get (30:39 - 30:43)
knocked out in a raid you just go back (30:41 - 30:45)
in with six more Pokemon if you have a (30:43 - 30:47)
group of people and I was able to do (30:45 - 30:50)
Tyranitar with with me and five other (30:47 - 30:52)
people so six people so if you're level (30:50 - 30:56)
five and all your Pokemon are maybe a (30:52 - 31:00)
hundred CP the other 19 people will get (30:56 - 31:02)
to the end of the raid and you will (31:00 - 31:04)
still get the you'll still get the 3000 (31:02 - 31:07)
cpe the 3000 xp for doing the raid (31:04 - 31:08)
you'll still get the golden raspberries (31:07 - 31:10)
you'll still get the chance at the TM (31:08 - 31:11)
you'll still get the you also get the (31:10 - 31:13)
revised and more importantly you'll (31:11 - 31:15)
still get the chance to catch the train (31:13 - 31:17)
star at the end so again it just (31:15 - 31:19)
validates my point that at this stage of (31:17 - 31:22)
the game CP doesn't really mean a lot (31:19 - 31:25)
the only reason it would mean something (31:22 - 31:28)
is if you want to try to solo those (31:25 - 31:30)
Tyranitar raids or solo those (31:28 - 31:33)
three raids sure I guess you can do that (31:30 - 31:36)
but at that point you're such a small (31:33 - 31:38)
percentage of all the players that it's (31:36 - 31:41)
you're like though you're like the 0.5% (31:38 - 31:44)
of players that want to try to solo a (31:41 - 31:46)
Machamp raid and if you can do it great (31:44 - 31:48)
what if what if I want to battle you (31:46 - 31:51)
battling is not available yet and then (31:48 - 31:52)
talked about this (31:51 - 31:54)
even if battling is available at server (31:52 - 31:56)
side and there's already enough server (31:54 - 32:00)
problems in raids and gyms that what is (31:56 - 32:01)
that battle gonna come down to who can (32:00 - 32:05)
tap faster maybe battling is about (32:01 - 32:11)
competitive dance maybe NCP and CP yeah (32:05 - 32:13)
that's just my thought on the Stardust (32:11 - 32:15)
thing I'm sure that there are people (32:13 - 32:17)
that you know are still gun hole on (32:15 - 32:19)
wanting Stardust but I think the other (32:17 - 32:20)
five rewards (32:19 - 32:23)
besides the buddy distance one I think (32:20 - 32:26)
the other four are more compelling let's (32:23 - 32:27)
talk about that's fine all the rewards (32:26 - 32:30)
can't be great right because if all the (32:27 - 32:31)
rewards were great then they'd actually (32:30 - 32:33)
all be mediocre so you have one bad (32:31 - 32:35)
reward makes all the other ones look (32:33 - 32:36)
good (32:35 - 32:40)
much like this podcast let's talk about (32:36 - 32:42)
the Pokemon mystery files video so this (32:40 - 32:46)
was a video that was posted on the (32:42 - 32:49)
official Japanese Pokemon YouTube (32:46 - 32:52)
account it looks like it was translated (32:49 - 32:55)
here but I think we'll you saw the video (32:52 - 32:57)
I saw the video do you wanna do you want (32:55 - 33:02)
to describe it well so it's like besides (32:57 - 33:04)
the I think it starts with the you known (33:02 - 33:08)
paddle pat panel am I correct in saying (33:04 - 33:11)
that where it's like whatever that that (33:08 - 33:14)
name is the words that are like what if (33:11 - 33:16)
this is real or what does it translate (33:14 - 33:19)
as it's just like it's it's a lot of (33:16 - 33:22)
questions it doesn't open yeah but what (33:19 - 33:23)
does the panel say oh the it demo it (33:22 - 33:26)
ends with the panel yeah well of the (33:23 - 33:29)
YouTube thumbnail is the unknown panel (33:26 - 33:34)
okay so it goes through like scenes from (33:29 - 33:36)
almost every generation of game at least (33:34 - 33:39)
every color generation of games and it (33:36 - 33:42)
has like Celebi (33:39 - 33:47)
and it has deoxys and all kinds of like (33:42 - 33:49)
all the outer-spacey (33:47 - 33:52)
weird and it's got weird music too and (33:49 - 33:55)
it's got like a pyramid shape and yeah (33:52 - 33:58)
it's a bunch of questions like where are (33:55 - 34:00)
these mysterious visitors from and just (33:58 - 34:05)
like it's all questions but no no (34:00 - 34:07)
answers yeah I don't know how to put it (34:05 - 34:10)
and just yet pictures and there's like (34:07 - 34:12)
clefairy is doing a Clefairy dance under (34:10 - 34:14)
the moon and there was that one scene (34:12 - 34:17)
from the pokey star studios which was (34:14 - 34:18)
the UFO movie (34:17 - 34:22)
yeah the invader movie so it's kind of (34:18 - 34:26)
like all the outer Spacey alien Pokemon (34:22 - 34:27)
stuff back although they did not (34:26 - 34:31)
specifically show LGM in BM so hmm (34:27 - 34:34)
that's a little odd to me there i think (34:31 - 34:37)
i'm the website you go to it shows them (34:34 - 34:41)
there's a website yes i have translation (34:37 - 34:43)
here from reddit the questions asked (34:41 - 34:47)
during the it's a two minute and nine (34:43 - 34:49)
second video it's all in Japanese all (34:47 - 34:50)
the questions are in Japanese I don't (34:49 - 34:52)
think there's any there's no one like (34:50 - 34:55)
talking or anything it's just question (34:52 - 34:56)
here's the scene from the Pokemon game (34:55 - 34:58)
question here's a scene from the Pokemon (34:56 - 35:01)
game and like will said starts with (34:58 - 35:03)
generation 1 and then goes all the way (35:01 - 35:05)
to the ultra beast in Sun and Moon the (35:03 - 35:08)
first question is time slip and then it (35:05 - 35:12)
says manipulating time they come from (35:08 - 35:18)
the moon space virus meeting an alien (35:12 - 35:24)
UFO sighting alien invasion the secret (35:18 - 35:28)
side of our world the secret of ancient (35:24 - 35:31)
ruins attack from another world (35:28 - 35:35)
possessing humans that's it assaults us (35:31 - 35:39)
and then it has the pyramid mmm (35:35 - 35:44)
mysterious the video just means nothing (35:39 - 35:48)
well what it means is hey there's a heck (35:44 - 35:52)
of a lot of weird stuff in Pokemon so (35:48 - 35:56)
yeah translate this into English well (35:52 - 35:59)
here's the thing the Pokemon YouTube (35:56 - 36:02)
Japanese channel has a lot of 30-second (35:59 - 36:07)
to three minute videos and most of them (36:02 - 36:13)
are just self-promotion of side games or (36:07 - 36:16)
this the stickers they do or the stamp (36:13 - 36:18)
contest we do like last week when we (36:16 - 36:19)
talked about the 7-eleven stuff where (36:18 - 36:21)
you can go to a 7-eleven and get a stamp (36:19 - 36:23)
and you get two stamps and you get a (36:21 - 36:25)
Pokemon so I did a little research and (36:23 - 36:26)
it looks like this is a teaser trailer (36:25 - 36:30)
for a pokémon fan club series called the (36:26 - 36:32)
mystery files which will come out on (36:30 - 36:35)
July 19th it looks like yes okay before (36:32 - 36:38)
the research some were saying oh that (36:35 - 36:40)
maybe this is something for Ultra Sun (36:38 - 36:43)
and ultra moon and it's possibly giving (36:40 - 36:45)
something ultra beast related but it (36:43 - 36:47)
just seems like it's a pokémon fan club (36:45 - 36:50)
series and those just those just seem to (36:47 - 36:53)
be short mini series that are japan-only (36:50 - 36:55)
kind of like I don't want to like I (36:53 - 36:56)
don't want to sound like I'm (36:55 - 36:59)
discrediting it but I think both you and (36:56 - 37:02)
I have both seen Pokemon Sunday and it's (36:59 - 37:04)
a Pokemon show that happens every Sunday (37:02 - 37:08)
but nothing ever happens during it ya (37:04 - 37:10)
know it's like a variety entertainment (37:08 - 37:15)
show with no plot direction or actual (37:10 - 37:18)
information of value distributed at all (37:15 - 37:22)
that this is along those lines that it's (37:18 - 37:24)
probably something we're not gonna get I (37:22 - 37:27)
think it's cool in the sense that (37:24 - 37:31)
sometimes we forget at least sometimes (37:27 - 37:33)
we like to sometimes we need to be (37:31 - 37:36)
reminded that not all Pokemon in the (37:33 - 37:40)
Pokemon universe are a world from the (37:36 - 37:42)
Pokemon world that Pokemon Keith (37:40 - 37:45)
yeah like D axis and star (37:42 - 37:52)
you and L gum and l GM l GM and BM (37:45 - 37:54)
they're from outer space and that's cool (37:52 - 37:56)
and I guess unknown is from outer space (37:54 - 37:58)
is that what that's referring to I don't (37:56 - 38:00)
know if that I I haven't looked at (37:58 - 38:03)
unknowns dex entry in in a while but I (38:00 - 38:06)
would assume that I don't think so but (38:03 - 38:10)
definitely like clefairy is from the (38:06 - 38:12)
moon I don't think there's much news (38:10 - 38:14)
there besides that but it is a really (38:12 - 38:16)
cool video if you wanted to check that (38:14 - 38:18)
out also more importantly there's a (38:16 - 38:22)
Magnemite video on the pokemon japan (38:18 - 38:24)
youtube channel and it's kind of like (38:22 - 38:26)
the magikarps r where it's just like (38:24 - 38:28)
it's just this Magikarp something but (38:26 - 38:29)
it's like a Magnemite song and it's (38:28 - 38:31)
really cute and it's really great and (38:29 - 38:33)
you should watch that too it's it's real (38:31 - 38:35)
good but I'd say it's a one watcher (38:33 - 38:38)
maybe two times mm-hmm I gave it three (38:35 - 38:40)
times and I still enjoyed it unless (38:38 - 38:43)
you're a really big Magnum a fan then go (38:40 - 38:44)
for it (38:43 - 38:45)
after the video I was kind of a (38:44 - 38:50)
Magnemite last bit of news here wouldn't (38:45 - 38:53)
be a Pokemon podcast without mentioning (38:50 - 38:56)
allegra frank polygon hike starring (38:53 - 38:59)
pokemons next movie reimagines (38:56 - 39:01)
reimagines the first season without (38:59 - 39:04)
Brock and Misty the upcoming 20th (39:01 - 39:06)
pokemon movie I choose you is a (39:04 - 39:09)
reimagining of the animes first season (39:06 - 39:11)
but don't expect everything to be the (39:09 - 39:14)
same Allegra writes among the biggest (39:11 - 39:16)
changes are new takes on classic moments (39:14 - 39:18)
for whatever reason the replacement of (39:16 - 39:20)
ash ketchum best friends Barack and (39:18 - 39:22)
misty I wouldn't go as far as saying (39:20 - 39:25)
best friend Zoe I was just going to say (39:22 - 39:28)
that I mean Missy was just following him (39:25 - 39:30)
around because she wanted to get her (39:28 - 39:33)
honey for her bike right and it was like (39:30 - 39:35)
almost like on did you ever see the (39:33 - 39:38)
movie better off dead mmm-hmm there's (39:35 - 39:40)
this little paperboy and he needs to (39:38 - 39:42)
collect two dollars to pay for the (39:40 - 39:44)
people's like newspaper delivery and he (39:42 - 39:46)
literally just follows the main (39:44 - 39:47)
character around the whole movie and (39:46 - 39:48)
he's like I want my two dollars (39:47 - 39:51)
and that's basically misty in the first (39:48 - 39:56)
season of Pokemon yeah Brock and misty (39:51 - 39:59)
left their posts as gym leaders early (39:56 - 40:01)
in the anime to accompany ash on his (39:59 - 40:03)
journey to becoming a Pokemon master (40:01 - 40:05)
I choose you for fits these characters (40:03 - 40:09)
in favor of two new fellow trainers (40:05 - 40:13)
there is so G whose partner is Lucario a (40:09 - 40:16)
fourth-generation Pokemon and there is (40:13 - 40:19)
Mikado whose buddy is Piplup (40:16 - 40:22)
and Mikado if I'm saying that right is (40:19 - 40:26)
the female I believe that's correct (40:22 - 40:28)
butchering these names both are (40:26 - 40:29)
prominent in the film's promotional (40:28 - 40:32)
materials check out the ex both are (40:29 - 40:34)
prominent in the film's promotional (40:32 - 40:35)
materials the jury is still out whether (40:34 - 40:39)
they're as memorable as the love lord (40:35 - 40:41)
broch and stubborn misty but we imagine (40:39 - 40:43)
that it will be hard to get nostalgic (40:41 - 40:46)
fans to warm up to them count us among (40:43 - 40:49)
the skeptics it's odd to replace Ash's (40:46 - 40:52)
best friend with two best friends with (40:49 - 40:55)
two new comers even if I choose you (40:52 - 40:57)
isn't a straight remake of the original (40:55 - 40:59)
Pokemon anime (40:57 - 41:02)
story this familiar and beloved may be (40:59 - 41:04)
able to withstand some tweaks but (41:02 - 41:05)
dropping some of the most visible (41:04 - 41:07)
characters may not be one of them (41:05 - 41:10)
I choose you premieres in Japan on July (41:07 - 41:12)
15th a Western date has not been (41:10 - 41:15)
announced correction Lucario is a fourth (41:12 - 41:17)
Jennifer come on not a third gen Pokemon (41:15 - 41:22)
yeah my biggest issue is that Marsha Doe (41:17 - 41:25)
is gonna be in there which is extra (41:22 - 41:28)
extra weird because that's no Lolan dude (41:25 - 41:32)
hi okay this this is this is nothing to (41:28 - 41:34)
do with Allegra she wrote the article (41:32 - 41:37)
I've seen I've seen people complain (41:34 - 41:39)
about Barak and Misty not being in here (41:37 - 41:41)
there's a ton of other sites I could (41:39 - 41:43)
have pulled the same exact article from (41:41 - 41:48)
here's the deal this movie is what 80 to (41:43 - 41:50)
90 minutes we already have to accept the (41:48 - 41:55)
fact that while the opening of the movie (41:50 - 42:00)
is a reimagining or the opening of the (41:55 - 42:02)
very first couple of episodes of the (42:00 - 42:06)
Pokemon anime there's no way that (42:02 - 42:08)
they're going to be able to tell that's (42:06 - 42:12)
that first season in (42:08 - 42:14)
movie timeline oh oh not the whole first (42:12 - 42:16)
season I can guarantee you there will be (42:14 - 42:18)
no Pikachu with a ketchup bottle (42:16 - 42:21)
guaranteed so you have to write a story (42:18 - 42:27)
that works in 80 to 90 minutes and the (42:21 - 42:31)
Pokemon anime as a full story is what (42:27 - 42:35)
how many episodes over 50 well but the (42:31 - 42:38)
first season would be about 26 episodes (42:35 - 42:39)
was it (42:38 - 42:42)
no when was it when does he get when (42:39 - 42:44)
does he leave for orange islands it's (42:42 - 42:46)
way more than 26 episodes that's not in (42:44 - 42:50)
the first season but still when Brock (42:46 - 42:53)
and Misty and then when he loses boiler (42:50 - 42:55)
when he loses to Richie that's kind of (42:53 - 42:57)
when everything falls apart (42:55 - 43:00)
but Brock and Misty hung out far longer (42:57 - 43:02)
than they should and then they came back (43:00 - 43:05)
well then is it misty that stays with (43:02 - 43:07)
and then Tracy joins and then Brock goes (43:05 - 43:10)
away yeah and then misty goes away and (43:07 - 43:12)
the Brock comes back in okay so here's (43:10 - 43:15)
my other problem is that this is the (43:12 - 43:18)
this it's not a problem here's here's (43:15 - 43:21)
the deal going back to the deal 82 (43:18 - 43:23)
episodes that's a lot of episodes the (43:21 - 43:28)
day the fact that I have so many (43:23 - 43:30)
thoughts okay so the first thought is I (43:28 - 43:33)
love when there's a reimagining of (43:30 - 43:36)
something and I love when when the (43:33 - 43:39)
creator when the producer whoever (43:36 - 43:42)
whoever is in charge of said reimagining (43:39 - 43:45)
product does something different with it (43:42 - 43:48)
if you're going to take the time and (43:45 - 43:50)
resources and you're going to retell a (43:48 - 43:56)
story I am one or that storyteller to (43:50 - 43:58)
make changes and I know that is hotly (43:56 - 44:00)
debated some people want it to be you (43:58 - 44:03)
know pitch perfect to the original some (44:00 - 44:05)
people want it to be dramatic but look (44:03 - 44:09)
if I want to see Ash's journey from (44:05 - 44:10)
start to finish (44:09 - 44:13)
I'll go rewatch the Pokemon anime it's (44:10 - 44:16)
very easily accessible they just redid (44:13 - 44:16)
it in HD (44:16 - 44:19)
it does look significantly better that (44:16 - 44:21)
that they're not taking that away from (44:19 - 44:23)
you but (44:21 - 44:26)
on top of that this is the first movie (44:23 - 44:29)
out of 20 movies where it doesn't fit in (44:26 - 44:33)
the actual Pokemon timeline so the last (44:29 - 44:36)
movie which was McGee erna the marvelous (44:33 - 44:39)
machine or something like that that fit (44:36 - 44:44)
in the timeline between the XY & z anime (44:39 - 44:46)
and the Sun and Moon enemy or wherever (44:44 - 44:48)
it felt it regardless it fit into the (44:46 - 44:51)
timeline this is the first movie to ever (44:48 - 44:55)
go back in time to do something not to (44:51 - 44:57)
mention there's a reason that Brock and (44:55 - 45:00)
misty aren't in this movie and the (44:57 - 45:02)
reason is because Ash never meets them (45:00 - 45:06)
he never actually encounters them when (45:02 - 45:09)
ash seized the ho-oh after the very (45:06 - 45:12)
first episode instead of going to the (45:09 - 45:15)
first gym where he would eventually meet (45:12 - 45:20)
Brock he decides to follow the HOH so he (45:15 - 45:22)
would never meet Brock because he never (45:20 - 45:26)
makes it to p-word city pewter yeah so (45:22 - 45:27)
it's a difference it's a different story (45:26 - 45:30)
altogether because of one fateful change (45:27 - 45:33)
yes they're telling me yes and I think (45:30 - 45:36)
that's really cool so I might actually (45:33 - 45:37)
be interested in seeing it rather than (45:36 - 45:41)
just a an abbreviated rehashing of (45:37 - 45:44)
something I've seen probably about 40 to (45:41 - 45:45)
50 times already yeah (45:44 - 45:48)
okay let's talk about misty because (45:45 - 45:52)
because ash doesn't make it past the (45:48 - 45:55)
Viridian Forest and I haven't seen the (45:52 - 45:56)
movie it's possible that he goes to the (45:55 - 45:58)
Viridian Forest and he goes to pure at (45:56 - 46:02)
city pewter pewter this movie isn't (45:58 - 46:05)
telling Ash's journey to collect eight (46:02 - 46:05)
badges (46:05 - 46:07)
it's collect it's telling a she's (46:05 - 46:11)
journey of following hoo so misty (46:07 - 46:13)
appears before that but to remind (46:11 - 46:15)
everyone Misty's what you said earlier (46:13 - 46:18)
will know the reason misty exists and (46:15 - 46:21)
the reason that misty sticks around as (46:18 - 46:24)
long as she does it's because she wants (46:21 - 46:26)
money for bike everything does not have (46:24 - 46:28)
to be resolved by the end of the film (46:26 - 46:31)
but still undo so I guess Pikachu's not (46:28 - 46:33)
gonna get attacked by a bunch of heroes (46:31 - 46:35)
or spiros or whatever he got attacked by (46:33 - 46:37)
either it could be (46:35 - 46:39)
and it seems in the trailer that there (46:37 - 46:41)
is there's a Butterfree moment so it (46:39 - 46:43)
seems like ash does CAPTCHA Caterpie (46:41 - 46:45)
again I haven't seen I haven't seen the (46:43 - 46:47)
movie but it looks like they're trying (46:45 - 46:50)
to retell the scene where Ash lets the (46:47 - 46:53)
butter frig go oh it's so sad it's (46:50 - 46:55)
called bye-bye butter free mmm-hmm (46:53 - 46:58)
so that's that's where that's where some (46:55 - 47:00)
of the more complaints come of okay ash (46:58 - 47:02)
goes on the separate journey they split (47:00 - 47:05)
the timeline instead of going to be (47:02 - 47:07)
instead of starting off to go get his (47:05 - 47:10)
badges he instead follows her which he (47:07 - 47:12)
never originally did in the very first (47:10 - 47:16)
episode if he follows ho and along the (47:12 - 47:18)
lines catches a Caterpie involves to a (47:16 - 47:20)
metapod and then at some point decides (47:18 - 47:22)
to release the Butterfree (47:20 - 47:24)
isn't that a story already told ya sure (47:22 - 47:28)
but it in itself is extremely memorable (47:24 - 47:32)
not only does it provide a fanservice to (47:28 - 47:35)
people like you and me well who have (47:32 - 47:37)
have been around the block we've seen (47:35 - 47:39)
the Pokemon anime especially when it (47:37 - 47:41)
originally debuted and we remember that (47:39 - 47:43)
moment of Butterfree but I do think it (47:41 - 47:45)
is an extremely powerful moment that new (47:43 - 47:47)
people should be able to experience (47:45 - 47:50)
because I think that if I was to pick a (47:47 - 47:54)
couple moments out of the thousands of (47:50 - 47:56)
hours hundreds of hours I don't know how (47:54 - 47:58)
many hours there are of the Pokemon (47:56 - 48:00)
anime that is such a strong and powerful (47:58 - 48:04)
moment to tell you that Pokemon are more (48:00 - 48:07)
than just these battling creatures that (48:04 - 48:12)
not only are they used to get badges and (48:07 - 48:14)
to earn money from preschoolers that (48:12 - 48:15)
only use zubats (48:14 - 48:19)
and to help you win championships (48:15 - 48:21)
they're also like your friends and they (48:19 - 48:24)
also represents they also represent (48:21 - 48:25)
moments in time and memories and (48:24 - 48:29)
connections and we joke about it all the (48:25 - 48:32)
time but like fans of this podcast know (48:29 - 48:34)
that I wasted a master ball on a gold a (48:32 - 48:37)
on a gold duck and that that has never (48:34 - 48:39)
lived me down and that's a good story to (48:37 - 48:43)
tell just like Butterfree leaving ash is (48:39 - 48:46)
a good story to tell so why not tell it (48:43 - 48:49)
again it's no ke story to tell it was (48:46 - 48:50)
nothing (48:49 - 48:53)
good story in the annals our canons of (48:50 - 48:57)
literature it's no Ivanhoe it's no (48:53 - 49:04)
Citizen Kane citizen gains not a book so (48:57 - 49:08)
there's my two cents I am I had I I (49:04 - 49:09)
can't remember the last time I've been (49:08 - 49:11)
so excited for a Pokemon movie though I (49:09 - 49:14)
am so excited for this movie that if it (49:11 - 49:16)
does have theatrical release I will fly (49:14 - 49:18)
to Texas to watch it I saw the black and (49:16 - 49:21)
white theatrical and I that was probably (49:18 - 49:22)
that actually that was probably the last (49:21 - 49:24)
time I was excited or a Pokemon movie (49:22 - 49:27)
see I saw that in a theater with with an (49:24 - 49:30)
on Pokemon fan and boy were they unhappy (49:27 - 49:32)
with me (49:30 - 49:35)
that movie was okay it wasn't it wasn't (49:32 - 49:37)
winning any Grammys but it was it was (49:35 - 49:40)
good I certainly hope it wouldn't win (49:37 - 49:44)
any Grammys since those are for music it (49:40 - 49:47)
is the Oscar that is for cinema cinema (49:44 - 49:49)
sometimes you got to try a little harder (49:47 - 49:53)
than that will okay I'll keep that in (49:49 - 49:53)
mind (49:53 - 49:56)
we're gonna take a quick break we I (49:53 - 49:58)
never mentioned this and I should and I (49:56 - 50:02)
feel bad but Nick Burgas Bert Burgess (49:58 - 50:04)
I'm sorry how do you say his last name (50:02 - 50:07)
it's Burgess I said it wrong I think for (50:04 - 50:09)
the first 50 episodes of my own podcast (50:07 - 50:14)
yes Nicholas Burgess does (50:09 - 50:17)
takes time out of out of his week I (50:14 - 50:21)
don't ask for these I don't send him (50:17 - 50:24)
music to do he listens to the show like (50:21 - 50:30)
any other fan if he finds humor and or (50:24 - 50:32)
pleasure in in me not being able to (50:30 - 50:36)
pronounce things and and turns them into (50:32 - 50:39)
remixes and we use them in our show (50:36 - 50:41)
because they're just fantastic and they (50:39 - 50:45)
bring a lot of joy to my Tim to me (50:41 - 50:48)
and so just a shout-out to Nick for (50:45 - 50:50)
doing these remixes again I don't ask (50:48 - 50:52)
for these he does them on their own (50:50 - 50:56)
there they're fantastic so I couldn't (50:52 - 50:57)
stop laughing when I heard the first one (50:56 - 50:59)
so if you're ever curious of where our (50:57 - 51:01)
break music comes from it comes from (50:59 - 51:04)

when there's not all three of us or at (52:34 - 52:38)
least three of us all right so first (52:36 - 52:41)
email here is from Daniel writes in and (52:38 - 52:43)
says hi SBJ have been a listener since (52:41 - 52:47)
around episode 100 ish and I'm an active (52:43 - 52:49)
member in the slack community I know (52:47 - 52:52)
this Daniel thank you thank you I am a (52:49 - 52:55)
math teacher math maths (52:52 - 52:56)
oh yeah doesn't doesn't England say (52:55 - 53:00)
maths yeah because they like like (52:56 - 53:01)
because if you were to say the full word (53:00 - 53:05)
it's mathematics Oh since that's plural (53:01 - 53:07)
there like they retain the plural on (53:05 - 53:08)
maths (53:07 - 53:13)
it just sounds awful I'm a math / math (53:08 - 53:14)
teacher whichever you prefer (53:13 - 53:17)
I don't really care despite living in (53:14 - 53:19)
England I started a club a few years ago (53:17 - 53:21)
with the aim of reaching a particular (53:19 - 53:24)
child who had just started with us and (53:21 - 53:28)
was in my house very hairy pottery and I (53:24 - 53:31)
could not believe how many closeted (53:28 - 53:33)
Pokemon players there were and how (53:31 - 53:36)
willing they were to talk and socialise (53:33 - 53:39)
together despite being different ages (53:36 - 53:41)
and from different friendship groups (53:39 - 53:43)
anyways with the help of Pokemon go my (53:41 - 53:45)
club became really popular and I was (53:43 - 53:48)
able to use it as a way to show the (53:45 - 53:51)
functional use of maths looking at (53:48 - 53:53)
probably probability of at least one (53:51 - 53:56)
flinch when firing off rock slide in (53:53 - 54:00)
doubles use of multiples of four when (53:56 - 54:02)
allocating IVs or the percentage of (54:00 - 54:05)
damage increase and decrease that occurs (54:02 - 54:08)
with stat changes and items I knew I hit (54:05 - 54:10)
the nail on the head when one kid went (54:08 - 54:14)
to me quote so if I get better at maths (54:10 - 54:17)
I get better at Pokemon - end quote (54:14 - 54:18)
that's really cute actually (54:17 - 54:21)
so anyways I have two questions one what (54:18 - 54:21)
is the (54:21 - 54:24)
probability of gaining at least one (54:21 - 54:26)
flinch when you fire off a rock slide in (54:24 - 54:29)
doubles please show all your workings (54:26 - 54:31)
Travis and we'll just need to be polite (54:29 - 54:33)
that goes for you too Steve if you're (54:31 - 54:35)
playing number two (54:33 - 54:37)
computer games often get bad press in (54:35 - 54:40)
terms of in terms of the influences they (54:37 - 54:42)
have on children but do you feel that (54:40 - 54:44)
Pokemon is different I'm assuming Peter (54:42 - 54:45)
games just means like general video (54:44 - 54:48)
games yeah thanks so much and keep up (54:45 - 54:50)
the great work as a busy teacher and dad (54:48 - 54:52)
your podcast and slack community have (54:50 - 54:54)
really kept me going when I've had to (54:52 - 54:58)
drop a lot of the more time-consuming (54:54 - 55:00)
elements of my social life (54:58 - 55:04)
Daniel slack named Steph folks staples - (55:00 - 55:06)
folks (55:04 - 55:08)
thank you for the email I wasn't (55:06 - 55:11)
rockslides probability like 30 percent (55:08 - 55:15)
flinch sort of 25 rock slides (55:11 - 55:20)
probability of causing a flinch its mm (55:15 - 55:22)
it's high enough that you use it in (55:20 - 55:25)
competitive and it's low enough that (55:22 - 55:28)
people get mad when it actually goes off (55:25 - 55:32)
alright so yeah it's Act the accuracy of (55:28 - 55:34)
rock slide to start with is 90 percent (55:32 - 55:38)
mm-hmm and then it has a 30% chance of (55:34 - 55:41)
causing flinch so ten percent that it'll (55:38 - 55:43)
miss if it does hit 30 percent chance (55:41 - 55:44)
that it will cause a flinch there's (55:43 - 55:46)
probably some math that they want us to (55:44 - 55:51)
do to the actual actual value is what is (55:46 - 55:56)
30 percent of 90 percent I don't know (55:51 - 55:58)
well 30 goes the 30 goes into 90 three (55:56 - 56:00)
times but that that that's not the (55:58 - 56:02)
message yeah not how it works let me (56:00 - 56:07)
bring out my calculator my he I you do (56:02 - 56:09)
that all into the second question (56:07 - 56:12)
computer games often get bad press in (56:09 - 56:14)
terms of influences do you feel Pokemon (56:12 - 56:14)
is different (56:14 - 56:19)
I feel like regardless of the game this (56:14 - 56:21)
question can go down so many avenues but (56:19 - 56:23)
like if I was a parent I would let my (56:21 - 56:26)
kids play video games but it wouldn't be (56:23 - 56:31)
a I think what my parents did was really (56:26 - 56:33)
rewarding and worked it worked for me as (56:31 - 56:35)
a kid when I got home from (56:33 - 56:37)
school I had to do all my homework (56:35 - 56:41)
before I could watch TV or do video (56:37 - 56:44)
games or you know go outside and play (56:41 - 56:47)
which is which was rare because I didn't (56:44 - 56:50)
enjoy going outside and I think that (56:47 - 56:53)
that's not a bad route to go down with (56:50 - 56:57)
kids to say that they get a bad rap (56:53 - 56:58)
there are plenty of games that are (56:57 - 57:02)
extremely educational and influential (56:58 - 57:06)
and I think Pokemon can be influential (57:02 - 57:09)
in the in the sense of something like (57:06 - 57:11)
Pokemon go or even the original Pokemon (57:09 - 57:13)
games where it did require you to meet (57:11 - 57:16)
other people and if I wanted to trade (57:13 - 57:18)
with somebody in pokemon red and blue I (57:16 - 57:19)
would have to you know go over to their (57:18 - 57:21)
house and bring a link cable or if they (57:19 - 57:23)
had a link cable and have a conversation (57:21 - 57:26)
with them and have some sort of fair (57:23 - 57:30)
deal of trading and trading together (57:26 - 57:31)
well I mean you could pull the link (57:30 - 57:36)
cable and cheat and but ya know I think (57:31 - 57:37)
I think those are important but that (57:36 - 57:39)
important but there are there could be (57:37 - 57:42)
situations where a kid plays pokemon red (57:39 - 57:44)
and never talks to anyone about it or (57:42 - 57:46)
goes outside or trades or do it does (57:44 - 57:48)
anything like that so I think you can (57:46 - 57:52)
apply that to most video games yeah I am (57:48 - 57:54)
I don't talk to my sister anymore (57:52 - 57:56)
because I was having a conversation with (57:54 - 57:57)
her one time (57:56 - 58:00)
and I was asking if my niece was playing (57:57 - 58:03)
Pokemon and my sister told me we don't (58:00 - 58:05)
play video games in our house I'd rather (58:03 - 58:07)
my children do things outdoors I've (58:05 - 58:09)
never spoken to her ever again so that's (58:07 - 58:10)
my opinion (58:09 - 58:13)
that's all this this really sides the (58:10 - 58:15)
side story but I think it relates the (58:13 - 58:17)
question did you figure out the the math (58:15 - 58:22)
it's 30% that the deal is right the (58:17 - 58:25)
probability of flinch is not impacted by (58:22 - 58:29)
the percentage hit percentage because (58:25 - 58:32)
technically 30% of the misses were (58:29 - 58:36)
flinches so it's 30% okay (58:32 - 58:39)
all right you did the math not me all (58:36 - 58:40)
right so this this quick side story (58:39 - 58:44)
there was a point in time where I was (58:40 - 58:47)
extremely stressed out this was probably (58:44 - 58:49)
I don't know how long ago this was (58:47 - 58:51)
probably about a year ago let's say (58:49 - 58:53)
probably about a week and a half about (58:51 - 58:57)
yesterday so Irene suggested that I (58:53 - 59:01)
should do meditation and I was like no (58:57 - 59:05)
no I was I was like I'm saying I don't (59:01 - 59:08)
have a problem thinking I don't have any (59:05 - 59:11)
issues when it comes to consistency and (59:08 - 59:13)
work I've you guys get the show every (59:11 - 59:17)
Monday regardless if I'm dying or not so (59:13 - 59:19)
I was like no no no no no I don't need (59:17 - 59:22)
to do that you know I'm saying I'm fine (59:19 - 59:27)
and as you as listeners know that you (59:22 - 59:30)
know I I do meditate now the reason I do (59:27 - 59:33)
was actually because of a video game (59:30 - 59:35)
because of the witness which I've talked (59:33 - 59:38)
about before that it was my favorite (59:35 - 59:41)
game of 2016 and I really really loved (59:38 - 59:44)
it because of that game even though I (59:41 - 59:46)
read was telling me over and over that I (59:44 - 59:47)
should do this and that I would really (59:46 - 59:49)
like it and that it would be really (59:47 - 59:52)
helpful and that there's science behind (59:49 - 59:54)
meditation and that was kind of like the (59:52 - 59:56)
big the big thing for me was like okay (59:54 - 59:57)
cool (59:56 - 59:59)
science can back this up it wasn't until (59:57 - 60:02)
I played through the witness that I (59:59 - 60:05)
realized what was actually going on I'm (60:02 - 60:07)
gonna spoil the witness by the way so (60:05 - 60:10)
strap in and if you if you don't care so (60:07 - 60:14)
the witness is a puzzle game in the (60:10 - 60:16)
sense of you have to draw you have a (60:14 - 60:18)
starting point and you have to get the (60:16 - 60:20)
starting point to the end by completing (60:18 - 60:24)
a specific rule so the rule might be on (60:20 - 60:26)
the first the first puzzles are there (60:24 - 60:27)
are these black squares and there are (60:26 - 60:29)
white squares and when you draw the line (60:27 - 60:30)
the line has to make sure that it goes (60:29 - 60:32)
between all the black and white squares (60:30 - 60:34)
so when you get to the end the black (60:32 - 60:35)
squares are on one side the white (60:34 - 60:38)
squares are on the other side it's like (60:35 - 60:39)
the black and white cookie and then (60:38 - 60:43)
there are different types of puzzles of (60:39 - 60:46)
maybe like you have to draw a line and (60:43 - 60:47)
inside those lines you have to make (60:46 - 60:49)
certain shapes so when you get to the (60:47 - 60:51)
end of the puzzle those shapes have to (60:49 - 60:54)
be formed by the line and something like (60:51 - 60:58)
that so throughout the witness you're on (60:54 - 61:00)
this giant puzzle island and there's a (60:58 - 61:03)
lot of symbols on the island and there (61:00 - 61:05)
a lot of environmental puzzles when you (61:03 - 61:06)
start playing when you're when you're (61:05 - 61:09)
playing the witness not only are you (61:06 - 61:10)
doing these line puzzles to unlock (61:09 - 61:14)
things but you're seeing line puzzles (61:10 - 61:17)
outside of the puzzles it's kind of hard (61:14 - 61:19)
to explain but you could be at the top (61:17 - 61:21)
of the mountain and when you look down (61:19 - 61:23)
you'll notice that the river looks like (61:21 - 61:25)
a puzzle you just did so you start (61:23 - 61:29)
seeing those outside of the the (61:25 - 61:31)
quote-unquote game and so then when (61:29 - 61:32)
you're walking around the witness you're (61:31 - 61:36)
seeing people's audio logs or people's (61:32 - 61:38)
notes and you're picking them up and (61:36 - 61:40)
you're you're discovering those and so (61:38 - 61:42)
when I'm playing the witness I'm (61:40 - 61:45)
thinking like not only am i doing these (61:42 - 61:47)
puzzles because I love puzzle games but (61:45 - 61:51)
now I'm like noticing how the world (61:47 - 61:54)
itself is this giant puzzle and there's (61:51 - 61:55)
these audio logs and there's these (61:54 - 61:59)
papers and they what is this like what (61:55 - 62:02)
is the story here so I'm going through (61:59 - 62:04)
the game and then at one point I'm close (62:02 - 62:06)
to the end but the puzzles are getting (62:04 - 62:10)
harder I told myself I'm just gonna look (62:06 - 62:13)
at the answers to this point I have what (62:10 - 62:17)
I have I've gotten my enjoyment out of (62:13 - 62:20)
the game like I have loved everything up (62:17 - 62:22)
to this point I just don't have anymore (62:20 - 62:24)
time to give it so I just want to look (62:22 - 62:26)
at the answers to get through the last (62:24 - 62:29)
you know 20 or 30 puzzles that red box (62:26 - 62:31)
rental was tick tock tick tock and on (62:29 - 62:34)
you and I just want to see I want to see (62:31 - 62:36)
what the island is about I want to know (62:34 - 62:38)
what happens at the at the end like (62:36 - 62:40)
everything just seems so compelling so (62:38 - 62:43)
fit like everything I love everything (62:40 - 62:45)
about this game I just don't have any (62:43 - 62:47)
more time to give it I just want to see (62:45 - 62:50)
the ending so I look I go through I look (62:47 - 62:51)
up the puzzles I do the puzzles per the (62:50 - 62:53)
rule with the guide in front of me and (62:51 - 62:55)
I'm going deeper and deeper into the end (62:53 - 62:58)
of the game you you get to the very end (62:55 - 62:59)
of the game and you do the last puzzle (62:58 - 63:02)
and this elevator comes out of the (62:59 - 63:05)
ground and you step inside the elevator (63:02 - 63:09)
and the elevator flies it's like Willy (63:05 - 63:11)
Wonka flies over the island and the (63:09 - 63:13)
credits are playing and nothing has been (63:11 - 63:16)
said nothing happens the credits finish (63:13 - 63:19)
and the elevator puts you at the very (63:16 - 63:23)
start of the game nothing is said (63:19 - 63:25)
there's no end story there's no (63:23 - 63:27)
additional dialogue you were just at the (63:25 - 63:31)
beginning of the game so now why I told (63:27 - 63:34)
the story why the witness is so (63:31 - 63:37)
important to me is because (63:34 - 63:37)
what meditation is and why I actually (63:38 - 63:42)
like it and why the witness as a game (63:39 - 63:47)
made me appreciate it is because it was (63:42 - 63:51)
never about the end it was about the (63:47 - 63:54)
journey (63:51 - 63:54)
the entire time I was playing the game I (63:54 - 63:59)
was so enthralled with it I was so in (63:56 - 64:02)
love with it I I was there hasn't been a (63:59 - 64:06)
game it's been the only game in in years (64:02 - 64:08)
where I took out a notebook and I'm (64:06 - 64:11)
writing notes and I'm drawing shapes and (64:08 - 64:13)
I'm taking pictures of my TV and I'm (64:11 - 64:16)
turning them upside down I just couldn't (64:13 - 64:17)
stop thinking about the witness (64:16 - 64:20)
and once I got to the ending and I (64:17 - 64:24)
realized that the journey was the (64:20 - 64:26)
journey I made for myself (64:24 - 64:28)
everything was were memories and (64:26 - 64:32)
feelings that I took and I experienced (64:28 - 64:33)
and it doesn't matter what the actual (64:32 - 64:36)
ending was it was the enjoyment to that (64:33 - 64:39)
point and that really was something that (64:36 - 64:41)
spoke to me and that's actually what (64:39 - 64:43)
meditation is about it's not meditation (64:41 - 64:46)
isn't about some end goal of becoming (64:43 - 64:49)
smarter or becoming more focused or B or (64:46 - 64:52)
or trying to you know clear your mind (64:49 - 64:56)
and and it can they do all that but it's (64:52 - 64:58)
about that journey and that experience (64:56 - 65:00)
meditation really is the actual journey (64:58 - 65:05)
itself and I think that games are (65:00 - 65:07)
powerful like that and I don't think (65:05 - 65:08)
that I would have experienced that (65:07 - 65:11)
without the witness there you go that's (65:08 - 65:13)
my story very off Pokemon topic but I (65:11 - 65:16)
wanted to tell it what if the journey is (65:13 - 65:18)
fraught with danger and peril I have (65:16 - 65:20)
what I would imagine that everyone would (65:18 - 65:21)
interpret that differently (65:20 - 65:25)
yes that's what meditation is for me a (65:21 - 65:28)
horrible maze full of minotaurs and (65:25 - 65:31)
other monsters this message is from Joey (65:28 - 65:34)
hello SP JM crew my question is would (65:31 - 65:37)
you want a live-action Pokemon movie and (65:34 - 65:40)
who would you cast as misty Brock and (65:37 - 65:45)
ash PS what about Gilbert Gottfried as (65:40 - 65:45)
me elf (65:45 - 65:49)
Gilbert Godfried is in disgrace and will (65:45 - 65:51)
never do anything related to Japan ever (65:49 - 65:54)
again if you don't know why probably (65:51 - 65:56)
look it up don't need to go into detail (65:54 - 65:58)
on that I would like a live-action (65:56 - 66:01)
Pokemon movie I think if it's done right (65:58 - 66:03)
that would be a lot of fun I'm really (66:01 - 66:05)
bad at like act I'm really bad at like (66:03 - 66:07)
actors and actresses and I don't (66:05 - 66:10)
I don't know I think we talked about (66:07 - 66:12)
when there were rumors of a live-action (66:10 - 66:15)
Pokemon movie would I want one yes but I (66:12 - 66:18)
would want a live-action Pokemon movie (66:15 - 66:20)
not to have ash misty and Brock in it (66:18 - 66:22)
because I do not want greedy I don't (66:20 - 66:26)
want the Harry Potter effect where you (66:22 - 66:29)
are where like I read all seven Harry (66:26 - 66:34)
Potter books I have it I had a image of (66:29 - 66:36)
what Harry Potter looked like when I was (66:34 - 66:38)
reading those books and then Daniel (66:36 - 66:40)
Radcliffe came along and he was Harry (66:38 - 66:45)
Potter and even though he's not Harry (66:40 - 66:46)
Potter anymore anymore because those (66:45 - 66:49)
movies ended it's hard to when I see (66:46 - 66:51)
like when I see Daniel Radcliffe I see (66:49 - 66:53)
Harry Potter and that's not to say he (66:51 - 66:54)
wasn't bad at his role I think he was a (66:53 - 66:58)
good Harry Potter but I know who ashes (66:54 - 67:00)
and what ash is about out of the 20 (66:58 - 67:02)
years of Pokemon anime I don't think (67:00 - 67:07)
there is a actor in the world that could (67:02 - 67:11)
fill those shoes yeah I agree and for me (67:07 - 67:14)
that it wasn't Harry Potter it was Scott (67:11 - 67:17)
Pilgrim that I read all of the Scott (67:14 - 67:19)
Pilgrim comic books and I had a vision (67:17 - 67:21)
for what Scott Pilgrim was supposed to (67:19 - 67:24)
be and then they cast Michael Cera as (67:21 - 67:27)
Scott Pilgrim and he is absolutely not (67:24 - 67:30)
what Scott Pilgrim is supposed to be so (67:27 - 67:34)
that like destroy I haven't seen the (67:30 - 67:37)
movie and I actually never read the last (67:34 - 67:39)
Scott Pilgrim I have no idea how the (67:37 - 67:41)
series resolves I'd never read the last (67:39 - 67:44)
one I was so upset that they cast (67:41 - 67:46)
Michael Cera as Scott's pilgrim when he (67:44 - 67:49)
is so not what Scott Pilgrim is supposed (67:46 - 67:52)
to be so yeah I wouldn't want to see the (67:49 - 67:54)
known characters I'd rather it be more (67:52 - 67:59)
like the the anime series that they did (67:54 - 68:01)
where it was like the retelling of (67:59 - 68:04)
red-and-blue story where those (68:01 - 68:09)
characters were or red and green where (68:04 - 68:11)
it was it was not related to previous (68:09 - 68:13)
content so they could take whatever (68:11 - 68:16)
liberties with it that they wanted the (68:13 - 68:18)
special is from Sam writes in and says (68:16 - 68:21)
hi SBJ and Friends it's (68:18 - 68:23)
I'm running in with three very important (68:21 - 68:25)
questions number one you guys could be (68:23 - 68:27)
any pokemon for a day excluding (68:25 - 68:30)
legendary Zara mythical what Pokemon (68:27 - 68:32)
would you be number two is Travis (68:30 - 68:35)
secretly a vampire and number three (68:32 - 68:37)
could you give a birthday shout-out to (68:35 - 68:39)
my sister Jillian she just started (68:37 - 68:41)
listening to this podcast and she (68:39 - 68:42)
recently got a phone for her birthday (68:41 - 68:45)
thank you for reading Sam but that's (68:42 - 68:46)
really cool (68:45 - 68:48)
shout out to Jillian I think I'm saying (68:46 - 68:51)
that right based on the spelling happy (68:48 - 68:52)
birthday (68:51 - 68:53)
let's get number two out of the way is (68:52 - 68:56)
Travis secretly a vampire no Travis goes (68:53 - 69:00)
to bed at like 8:00 p.m. but you are a (68:56 - 69:03)
vampire no secret about it mmhmm yeah (69:00 - 69:06)
that that's accurate and actually it (69:03 - 69:09)
just a zoo bat number one a Pokemon for (69:06 - 69:14)
a day well oh that's tough one (69:09 - 69:14)
can I be like bowls wall but buzz bulb (69:14 - 69:19)
eyes as well I mean technically an (69:16 - 69:23)
ultra-beam edges yeah that's why that's (69:19 - 69:24)
what I want to be bus full because I (69:23 - 69:27)
want to push the edges I'm one of my (69:25 - 69:30)
buzz will is gross yeah what's a better (69:27 - 69:32)
one first school it's all about the (69:30 - 69:34)
banging and clanging and I still haven't (69:32 - 69:37)
been able to get you in the gym or (69:34 - 69:39)
clanging and banging whatever why do you (69:37 - 69:42)
got to be an ultra beast cuz they can go (69:39 - 69:45)
through wormholes but not me like they (69:42 - 69:47)
go they could go through wormholes (69:45 - 69:49)
probably like deoxys can but I can't (69:47 - 69:51)
pick the axis because they the axis (69:49 - 69:53)
isn't classify it as an ultra beast but (69:51 - 69:56)
the axis is like a legendary also so (69:53 - 69:59)
damn so legendary or mythical it's (69:56 - 70:01)
off-limits that's why that's why I'm (69:59 - 70:03)
picking so I'm picking it all to be (70:01 - 70:06)
breaking the rules I want to be (70:03 - 70:10)
something fantastic but accessible I (70:06 - 70:13)
mean it's only for a day I know but so (70:10 - 70:15)
it's like what what can you do in that (70:13 - 70:17)
one day probably like you should be a (70:15 - 70:19)
flying-type so you can go someplace and (70:17 - 70:21)
then it's like oh I'm a human again but (70:19 - 70:26)
look I'm in British Columbia you could (70:21 - 70:30)
probably be like a gang gar and then go (70:26 - 70:34)
invisible like rob a bank (70:30 - 70:38)
well I mean probably when you say Rob it (70:34 - 70:40)
sounds so violent you just borrow the (70:38 - 70:43)
money and forget to return it (70:40 - 70:47)
hmm being a ghost type would be kind of (70:43 - 70:50)
weird though because then you're like a (70:47 - 70:53)
spirit yeah (70:50 - 70:55)
what's a Pokemon that has a really cool (70:53 - 70:58)
unique move what about a toga kiss (70:55 - 71:01)
that's such like a happy Pokemon what (70:58 - 71:04)
would you be doing flying around and (71:01 - 71:06)
being happy hmm (71:04 - 71:08)
putting Thunder Wave on people and then (71:06 - 71:11)
doing fuse ray and then flinching ma my (71:08 - 71:14)
Togekiss is more of a follow the finger (71:11 - 71:18)
I've indeed follow follow me well if (71:14 - 71:21)
you're gonna use the English term for it (71:18 - 71:24)
it's um what's something gen-5 it's like (71:21 - 71:29)
real choice Garrett betray on no bare (71:24 - 71:34)
take I want to you polar bear Pascal and (71:29 - 71:38)
Pascal and nobody likes braver Airy (71:34 - 71:42)
gravy area yeah that's legit but baby (71:38 - 71:44)
baby area is pretty sweet (71:42 - 71:47)
you could mmm you know you could carry (71:44 - 71:49)
an American flag with you but I would be (71:47 - 71:51)
the American flag yeah (71:49 - 71:53)
nice bald eagle and bald eagles are (71:51 - 71:56)
native to the Washington DC area so so (71:53 - 71:59)
you wouldn't be like poached like an egg (71:56 - 72:08)
yeah no Josh just writes in hello there (71:59 - 72:11)
s BJ will Travis Micah Irene whoever is (72:08 - 72:14)
on just us just the two of us just the (72:11 - 72:17)
two of us my name is Josh and I am from (72:14 - 72:20)
salving ttyn Connecticut shout out to (72:17 - 72:22)
Mike from South in Connecticut who wrote (72:20 - 72:26)
in on episode 273 that's really cool (72:22 - 72:28)
I've probably been through there at some (72:26 - 72:30)
point in my life a lot of time near (72:28 - 72:34)
Connecticut do you all have a Pokemon (72:30 - 72:37)
that you feel is underappreciated I mean (72:34 - 72:40)
that a I mean a Pokemon that you like (72:37 - 72:42)
that doesn't seem to get the love in (72:40 - 72:45)
general from the general community (72:42 - 72:48)
mine is snivel slash Weavile (72:45 - 72:52)
the dark /ice typing makes it pretty (72:48 - 72:55)
irrelevant in the competitive scene and (72:52 - 72:57)
the fact that it's only found in late (72:55 - 73:00)
caves and the game means people tend to (72:57 - 73:01)
already have a full team by the time (73:00 - 73:03)
they find it I think the design is (73:01 - 73:06)
really cool and sleek while the shiny is (73:03 - 73:08)
one of the biggest changes from the (73:06 - 73:10)
original color scheme I'm interested in (73:08 - 73:12)
what you all think (73:10 - 73:15)
thanks Josh for me I would say frost (73:12 - 73:20)
last probably whose ice ghost I just (73:15 - 73:25)
she's real cool and yeah nobody gets (73:20 - 73:27)
that excited for all frost laughs I (73:25 - 73:31)
think mine would probably be lotad lotad (73:27 - 73:34)
is not underrated people love Lotte I (73:31 - 73:37)
don't think so man they do like the (73:34 - 73:42)
Ludicolo though Ludo Cola that dude see (73:37 - 73:46)
it like I think here's my problem is I (73:42 - 73:50)

the sombrero I'm down but when I have a (75:12 - 75:20)
Ludicolo I just think I want lotad (75:17 - 75:24)
instead but I don't want I still want a (75:20 - 75:27)
Ludicolo lo Ted's not powerful enough (75:24 - 75:29)

in the top ten of our Kickstarter (75:37 - 75:42)
episode and you all rejected lotad (75:39 - 75:46)
instantly um you made some bad choices (75:42 - 75:49)
lotad is not in the top ten of all (75:46 - 75:53)
Pokemon no hmm I disagree (75:49 - 75:57)
Japanese named OspA I think uh I think (75:53 - 75:59)

is a neato King and because it's Pokemon (76:23 - 76:29)
the week we're gonna mix it up we are I (76:26 - 76:32)
am going to do the move set because (76:29 - 76:34)
Travis is (76:32 - 76:36)
not here but we are going to tell you (76:34 - 76:38)
about this Pokemon which we used to do (76:36 - 76:42)
and we stopped to doing but will is (76:38 - 76:45)
taking that over with my best scientist (76:42 - 76:47)
voice so we'll take it away (76:45 - 76:51)
nito king is a large bipedal purple (76:47 - 76:53)
pokemon with distinct reptilian features (76:51 - 76:57)
it has narrow eyes large spiny ears for (76:53 - 77:00)
like Tufts on its cheeks and a short (76:57 - 77:02)
snout filled with pointed teeth there is (77:00 - 77:04)
a long venomous horn on its forehead and (77:02 - 77:07)
the ridge of spines down its back grey (77:04 - 77:09)
plates cover its chest and belly and (77:07 - 77:11)
there is a gray rounded spine on each (77:09 - 77:15)
elbow each hand was three cause while (77:11 - 77:29)
foot has only a single three claws while (77:15 - 77:33)
each foot has only a single hoof like (77:29 - 77:38)
nail it has a long powerful tail this is (77:33 - 77:41)
a male only species the female (77:38 - 77:45)
counterpart is Nidoqueen it is said that (77:41 - 77:47)
neither Kings tail is capable of (77:45 - 77:49)
toppling a metal transmission tower (77:47 - 77:52)
needle King uses this tail to smash (77:49 - 77:55)
constrict or break the bones of its prey (77:52 - 77:58)
and enemies the tail can be swung to (77:55 - 78:00)
create distance between it and its foes (77:58 - 78:03)
before Neto King charges its steel like (78:00 - 78:06)
hide adds to its powerful rampaging (78:03 - 78:10)
charges Edo King lives in grasslands you (78:06 - 78:12)
said it was hard to read that wasn't so (78:10 - 78:13)
hard to read except for the part that (78:12 - 78:16)
was really poorly written (78:13 - 78:18)
all of these are poorly written though (78:16 - 78:20)
that's very true and that that's not (78:18 - 78:23)
knocking both PD it's just very it's (78:20 - 78:26)
it's not the most readable thing in the (78:23 - 78:29)
world I'm gonna give you a Pokemon go (78:26 - 78:32)
moveset mostly because we picked neato (78:29 - 78:34)
King last minute we didn't get to ask (78:32 - 78:36)
the slack community with moves that was (78:34 - 78:38)
we'll just keep it short and sweet here (78:36 - 78:42)
so yeah if you have a and we plan on (78:38 - 78:44)
doing no normal move sets in the future (78:42 - 78:46)
this is just a one-off but if you have a (78:44 - 78:48)
need o King in Pokemon go (78:46 - 78:49)
the two best moves that you can have for (78:48 - 78:54)
it is poison jab and earthquake you have (78:49 - 78:57)
a possibility of getting poison jab or (78:54 - 78:59)
iron tail as the first move and the (78:57 - 79:01)
second moves you have the possibility of (78:59 - 79:03)
getting earthquake sludge wave and (79:01 - 79:06)
megahorn to get the stab bonus on both (79:03 - 79:08)
of those you get the poison from the (79:06 - 79:10)
poison jab you get the ground from the (79:08 - 79:12)
earthquake those are gonna be the two (79:10 - 79:16)
best so hopefully your needle King or (79:12 - 79:20)
that line has those type of moves and if (79:16 - 79:21)
you're playing Pokemon go you're gonna (79:20 - 79:23)
want to avoid using needle King against (79:21 - 79:27)
Alakazam Espeon and jinx those are kind (79:23 - 79:30)
of the big three that's threatened (79:27 - 79:33)
needle King and finally we can do a (79:30 - 79:35)
little bit of trivia here I know we (79:33 - 79:37)
talked about needle King last week but (79:35 - 79:39)
needle King and its female counterpart (79:37 - 79:41)
needle queen share the same category (79:39 - 79:44)
with Rhydon and rhyperior they are all (79:41 - 79:47)
known as the drill Pokemon X to Groot (79:44 - 79:50)
the extra drill left out apparently (79:47 - 79:52)
additionally all four are partly (79:50 - 79:53)
ground-types (79:52 - 79:57)
although its female counterpart needle (79:53 - 80:01)
Queen cannot be bred nito King can be (79:57 - 80:04)
okay needle Queen and needle King are (80:01 - 80:06)
the only Pokemon with a poison ground (80:04 - 80:09)
type combination huh I don't know that (80:06 - 80:13)
seven gens and only one and finally (80:09 - 80:15)
needle King is a popular choice with the (80:13 - 80:18)
anime rivals as both Ash's main rival (80:15 - 80:23)
Gary and Paul as well as Jimmy both use (80:18 - 80:25)
are all three used needle King and (80:23 - 80:28)
actually ground type is strong against (80:25 - 80:31)
poison type what is mm needle Kings we (80:28 - 80:36)
can ice we took ground poison it's week (80:31 - 80:41)
two it's week two psychic psychic water (80:36 - 80:44)
ground and ice ground on ground violence (80:41 - 80:45)
