of your time trainers no we said take (1:23 - 1:27)
over too much of your time and you're (1:25 - 1:29)
like what does that mean what could that (1:27 - 1:31)
possibly be I think it was like Naima or (1:29 - 1:33)
whatever in the chat who was like it's (1:31 - 1:36)
obviously Team Rocket there's an ongoing (1:33 - 1:39)
relationship with me in the Attic which (1:36 - 1:44)
is how much time are you consuming it's (1:39 - 1:47)
been about four years now okay we got a (1:44 - 1:48)
show for you guys we got a little bit of (1:47 - 1:51)
good news we have some mobile news I (1:48 - 1:54)
guess it's referring to all of Nintendo (1:51 - 1:58)
stuff in general we have some TCG stuff (1:54 - 2:00)
is it some cafe mix news because I've (1:58 - 2:02)
been playing some cafe mix no but we can (2:00 - 2:05)
squeeze in some cafe mix I know score (2:02 - 2:07)
bunny is leaving and Sabha Liz coming (2:05 - 2:11)
y-yeah oh no hmm (2:07 - 2:14)
scar bunny is working at my cafe thank (2:11 - 2:16)
you very much well I guess let's jump (2:14 - 2:18)
let's just start with the cafe stuff I (2:16 - 2:21)
have I have not played it there's a (2:18 - 2:25)
reason for that but Greg you've been (2:21 - 2:27)
playing the cafe mix I haven't played (2:25 - 2:29)
the cafe mix okay here's here's the (2:27 - 2:33)
thing okay the cafe owner is clearly (2:29 - 2:36)
evil because the cafe owner is like I'm (2:33 - 2:38)
gonna get you new items that's going to (2:36 - 2:38)
really help but you're (2:38 - 2:40)
Caffe and you know what it does it makes (2:38 - 2:43)
solving the puzzles worse every (2:40 - 2:46)
everything she introduces makes the game (2:43 - 2:51)
harder that is not helping standing in (2:46 - 2:55)
the way of solid progress of me serving (2:51 - 2:59)
sandwiches pancakes waffles tea coffee (2:55 - 3:02)
lattes - sweet Pokemon friends she's (2:59 - 3:04)
like I'm gonna give you cheese I'm like (3:02 - 3:07)
cool why is cheese blocking everything (3:04 - 3:09)
that I can do because that's what cheese (3:07 - 3:13)
do yeah apparently did you get the other (3:09 - 3:17)
half of who's the electric doggie Yammer (3:13 - 3:20)
Yammer did you get the other half of the (3:17 - 3:22)
game I've only seen the uppers but I've (3:20 - 3:23)
never seen the Amber's face you only get (3:22 - 3:25)
the but cake I've only got the but cake (3:23 - 3:29)
the other I think despite it being a (3:25 - 3:30)
tomato sandwich (3:29 - 3:33)
I think the Dugtrio sandwich is my (3:30 - 3:37)
favorite I've seen the Dutch really the (3:33 - 3:39)
amber butts kind of cute too but this (3:37 - 3:41)
cafe owner is straight-up (3:39 - 3:44)
evil evil you didn't play Schieffelin (3:41 - 3:48)
rig I did oh is it better than shuffle (3:44 - 3:50)
it can't be what do you mean it can't be (3:48 - 3:52)
of course it can be that was a (3:50 - 3:56)
possibility out rifle is a masterpiece (3:52 - 4:01)
was one and it had some deterioration (3:56 - 4:04)
towards the end I'll say all good things (4:01 - 4:09)
have come to an end the game play and (4:04 - 4:12)
how the puzzles working cafe mix is (4:09 - 4:16)
vastly different then shuffle like the (4:12 - 4:19)
fact that you are drawing circles are to (4:16 - 4:21)
connect things but what else you're (4:19 - 4:24)
doing is you're trying to shove it's (4:21 - 4:26)
like you're trying to take tomatoes and (4:24 - 4:27)
push them over to this side and so (4:26 - 4:29)
you're trying to not only link but try (4:27 - 4:31)
to link things in a way to push things (4:29 - 4:34)
to where you want them makes cafe mix (4:31 - 4:38)
way more difficult than that shuffle (4:34 - 4:40)
ever was Scheffel is pretty much it was (4:38 - 4:43)
always like you know try to get you know (4:40 - 4:46)
line up the lines this is very much you (4:43 - 4:48)
have so much freedom and movement but a (4:46 - 4:51)
lot of the game is trying to move things (4:48 - 4:53)
on the puzzle (4:51 - 4:55)
or towards or away from certain other (4:53 - 4:58)
items to make them fall in certain spots (4:55 - 5:01)
that it's it's surprisingly more complex (4:58 - 5:03)
than I thought it was going to be there (5:01 - 5:07)
I have lost I have lost puzzles multiple (5:03 - 5:09)
multiple times because I can't figure (5:07 - 5:11)
out exactly how to loop things around to (5:09 - 5:14)
move the tomato over the basket because (5:11 - 5:16)
it doesn't have that much give but if (5:14 - 5:19)
you think it should it's a surprisingly (5:16 - 5:21)
complex game and then she adds more (5:19 - 5:22)
complexity (5:21 - 5:27)
I don't need honey stop it I really like (5:22 - 5:28)
this art style (5:27 - 5:31)
it's like watercolors animation to start (5:28 - 5:34)
it out Wow and that Evie it's so happy (5:31 - 5:36)
it got a little play the Evie pancakes (5:34 - 5:41)
will have you not played I just started (5:36 - 5:41)
well I guess we'll come back next week (5:41 - 5:45)
to see if it's better than garden scapes (5:44 - 5:48)
for you I mean that's a tough stretch (5:45 - 5:52)
yeah it's it's a very good game like I'm (5:48 - 5:55)
surprised that I'm just like oh I have (5:52 - 5:56)
five minutes I'm gonna go try a couple (5:55 - 5:59)
of puzzles and often in that five (5:56 - 6:01)
minutes I have not been able to figure (5:59 - 6:03)
out how to work through the puzzle that (6:01 - 6:05)
I'm currently on alright I'm confused I (6:03 - 6:07)
just walked through the door of this (6:05 - 6:09)
restaurant and the waitress Leah said (6:07 - 6:11)
hello to me and then she said you must (6:09 - 6:14)
be the owner I yeah if you work for me (6:11 - 6:16)
what make my life difficult (6:14 - 6:18)
well but also how do you not know who I (6:16 - 6:22)
am what kind of bizarre hiring profit (6:18 - 6:24)
process did we have that I didn't we (6:22 - 6:26)
didn't meet and you're already serving (6:24 - 6:30)
people at my restaurant this is a dojo (6:26 - 6:32)
situation everybody surprised that you (6:30 - 6:34)
are who you at you don't match what I (6:32 - 6:37)
thought you were hmm I'm assuming phone (6:34 - 6:40)
not switch phone I'm phoning it up right (6:37 - 6:41)
now okay (6:40 - 6:44)
can I tell you why I haven't played this (6:41 - 6:46)
game yet it's possibly the dumbest (6:44 - 6:48)
reason in the entire world because (6:46 - 6:50)
you're not sponsored by the Pokemon (6:48 - 6:51)
company international and you will play (6:50 - 6:53)
any mobile games unless that company (6:51 - 6:55)
sponsors you or has a relationship or (6:53 - 6:58)
whatever that word is that you use no (6:55 - 7:01)
that's not it if you guess the two (6:58 - 7:03)
aren't linked no that's not it either (7:01 - 7:06)
it's dumber than that it's it (7:03 - 7:10)
I think that like for people listening (7:06 - 7:13)
this podcast can relate to me here this (7:10 - 7:19)
has a huge play should go I hate any app (7:13 - 7:22)
that requires me to turn my phone (7:19 - 7:27)
sideways why I cannot stand it is this (7:22 - 7:29)
why you haven't played garden scapes yet (7:27 - 7:32)
I didn't know garden scapes was (7:29 - 7:35)
horizontal but now I'm interested how do (7:32 - 7:39)
you watch videos I just suck it up and (7:35 - 7:43)
hold it vertically I just (7:39 - 7:54)
wow you that can relate like two minutes (7:43 - 7:58)
I am NOT like swiping down turning off (7:54 - 8:00)
orientation lock turning the phone you (7:58 - 8:05)
can meditation lock on 24/7 let me tell (8:00 - 8:06)
you what's always on my phone do not (8:05 - 8:08)
disturb always on orientation lock (8:06 - 8:11)
always on forever and ever because when (8:08 - 8:14)
I'm laying in bed checking Twitter or (8:11 - 8:18)
checking a website on Safari I do not (8:14 - 8:20)
need the like phone to like decide (8:18 - 8:22)
whether it should be horizontal and not (8:20 - 8:27)
horizontal hundred-percent happens oh (8:22 - 8:31)
look what your hand I also want us to (8:27 - 8:34)
flashback to the past where he was like (8:31 - 8:36)
we have to have autosave because people (8:34 - 8:38)
drop their switches and lose all their (8:36 - 8:40)
data wallet what are you doing and do (8:38 - 8:43)
you live on an earthquake is that where (8:40 - 8:47)
you guys located in the sword and shield (8:43 - 8:49)
world I have I've had that game crash at (8:47 - 8:52)
least four times in the last you're (8:49 - 8:53)
pushing it you push the limits that's (8:52 - 8:55)
the probably no more than four probably (8:53 - 8:57)
three to four times or to save a save me (8:55 - 9:00)
I you don't want to turn my phone (8:57 - 9:11)
sideways sleeper like if you're if (9:00 - 9:14)

don't sleep because that's if I try to (9:26 - 9:30)
sleep on my stomach (9:28 - 9:33)
no I am a side sleeper but and this is (9:30 - 9:36)
the important component when I'm goofing (9:33 - 9:39)
around on my phone in bed I prop up two (9:36 - 9:42)
pillows on the headboard and I sit up in (9:39 - 9:46)
the bed and goof on my phone ready for (9:42 - 9:48)
sleep the phone goes away I turn on my (9:46 - 9:49)
side and I go to sleep (9:48 - 9:51)
like a gentle sweet little baby angel (9:49 - 9:54)
that I am it video entertainment is not (9:51 - 9:57)
for the bed that also agree you do those (9:54 - 9:59)
things away from the place that you (9:57 - 10:01)
sleeps that you are associate the bed (9:59 - 10:05)
with sleeping and not a million other (10:01 - 10:07)
things that keep you awake there's no TV (10:05 - 10:10)

the in the bedroom that is a recipe for (10:10 - 10:17)
an unhappy marriage and life this is my (10:12 - 10:19)
bedroom it's like I have a chair I have (10:17 - 10:23)
a bedside table I have a bed no TV no (10:19 - 10:26)
electronics you do not need electronics (10:23 - 10:28)
mucking up your sleep schedule you do (10:26 - 10:30)

properties brothers boring show to love (10:30 - 10:35)
you in latency and in deliciousness yes (10:33 - 10:38)
you should be sitting in a chair freely (10:35 - 10:41)
moving your arms so you can watch videos (10:38 - 10:43)
and the proper orientation (10:41 - 10:46)
oh my guess what I'm laying in bed I do (10:43 - 10:48)

movie this is off Bloomberg according to (14:50 - 14:57)
their website this is my last free (14:55 - 15:00)
article otherwise I have to pay $6 a (14:57 - 15:03)
month this is a Nintendo chills mobile (15:00 - 15:06)
ambitions after animal Crossing's (15:03 - 15:10)
success Nintendo is retreating from the (15:06 - 15:13)
77 billion dollar mobile gaming arena (15:10 - 15:16)
after disappointing results deflated (15:13 - 15:18)
once lofty ambitions entering a (15:16 - 15:20)
multi-year effort just as the market (15:18 - 15:22)
goes through an unprecedent Cova era (15:20 - 15:27)
boom president foo acara proclaimed two (15:22 - 15:29)
years ago that smartphone games would be (15:27 - 15:32)
1 billion business with personal growth (15:29 - 15:34)
potential building on the processors (15:32 - 15:37)
that promised Nintendo would release 2 (15:34 - 15:39)
to 3 mobile titles each year created (15:37 - 15:41)
hopes among investors that gaming (15:39 - 15:43)
powerhouses could carve out a (15:41 - 15:45)
substantial slice of the market in May (15:43 - 15:47)
however the president adopted a market (15:45 - 15:51)
marked differently toon saying quote we (15:47 - 15:54)
are not necessarily looking to continue (15:51 - 15:56)
to release many new applications for the (15:54 - 15:57)
mobile market (15:56 - 16:01)
end quote Nintendo's shares slid 4% (15:57 - 16:03)
day after the remark close observers (16:01 - 16:04)
might have sense that Nintendo was (16:03 - 16:06)
growing disillusioned with the mobile (16:04 - 16:09)
realm even earlier at smartphone games (16:06 - 16:11)
were projected its smartphone games (16:09 - 16:13)
project was born out of this necessity (16:11 - 16:15)
to shore up the bottom line of the we (16:13 - 16:18)
used failure now riding a surge in (16:15 - 16:19)
switch popularity and investor (16:18 - 16:22)
confidence the kyoto based company (16:19 - 16:24)
appears to have reassessed the mobile (16:22 - 16:26)
business and narrowed its focused on its (16:24 - 16:29)
own console ecosystem in a period (16:26 - 16:31)
through February through May when other (16:29 - 16:34)
studios were posting record earnings (16:31 - 16:35)
alongside Kovan lockdowns (16:34 - 16:38)
sensor tower data showed Marquis (16:35 - 16:40)
Nintendo titles like Super Mario run (16:38 - 16:43)
plummeting by double digits at the same (16:40 - 16:45)
time Nintendo's own Animal Crossing new (16:43 - 16:47)
horizons just became a quintessential (16:45 - 16:50)
haven from virus anxiety powering the (16:47 - 16:52)
switch console to new heights and of (16:50 - 16:54)
popularity and pushing the company's (16:52 - 16:57)
share price to a 12-year high last week (16:54 - 16:59)
mobile games are expected to make up 77 (16:57 - 17:02)
billion this year which would account (16:59 - 17:05)
for half the overall game industry (17:02 - 17:08)
according to research from new zoo but (17:05 - 17:10)
since the release of Mario Kart tour in (17:08 - 17:13)
fall of 2019 Nintendo's mobile pipeline (17:10 - 17:15)
is empty alright there's a little bit (17:13 - 17:17)
more to the article but we'll stop there (17:15 - 17:19)
right now cuz well how many of (17:17 - 17:21)
Nintendo's mobile games have been (17:19 - 17:23)
horizontal versus vertical because (17:21 - 17:25)
obviously that's determining your (17:23 - 17:28)
success in the marketplace I have I have (17:25 - 17:29)
a graph here this is a bunch of (17:28 - 17:32)
different games so we have drag algea (17:29 - 17:35)
lost Super Mario run Fire Emblem and (17:32 - 17:37)

gia lost Super Mario run and Fire Emblem (17:55 - 18:00)
heroes all in the negative Animal (17:57 - 18:02)
Crossing pocket camp the only Nintendo (18:00 - 18:05)
game in the positive up by about 50% and (18:02 - 18:07)

percent roblox one hundred and twenty (18:07 - 18:12)
rise of kingdoms one hundred thirty and (18:09 - 18:14)
then pub G mobile up one hundred (18:12 - 18:16)
fifty percent due to the pandemic three (18:14 - 18:18)
out of four of Nintendo's mobile games (18:16 - 18:21)
not doing too hot yeah also they don't (18:18 - 18:23)
advertise them I mean I'm sure they do (18:21 - 18:24)
they probably advertise them on Facebook (18:23 - 18:28)
and believe me I have seen (18:24 - 18:31)
advertisements for all the ones that (18:28 - 18:33)
make a lot of money and I've yet to see (18:31 - 18:37)
an advertisement for Super Mario in like (18:33 - 18:38)
it's not on my phone I don't have it I (18:37 - 18:40)
never see it I have never seen one for (18:38 - 18:42)
Animal Crossing pocket gap they don't (18:40 - 18:48)
come up and like is not a secret on my (18:42 - 18:50)
phone like they would look that I have (18:48 - 18:52)
the Nintendo stuff and send it to me I (18:50 - 18:54)
don't see them I don't see them Facebook (18:52 - 18:56)
I don't see them on Twitter I don't see (18:54 - 18:57)
them my Instagram I literally do not (18:56 - 19:00)
ever see them advertised yeah I only get (18:57 - 19:02)
the really crummy games advertised the (19:00 - 19:05)
garbage kids yeah that's one of them (19:02 - 19:08)
yeah because well the pranking raisa (19:05 - 19:11)
kingdoms all the time I got one what is (19:08 - 19:13)
that one that's always on YouTube rage (19:11 - 19:16)
shadow legends I don't get that well (19:13 - 19:17)
wait maybe I do is that the one where (19:16 - 19:18)
they have like the characters from the (19:17 - 19:20)
game are angry because they're not good (19:18 - 19:23)
at playing the game probably so the (19:20 - 19:25)
assured garden escapes and the issue (19:23 - 19:28)
with play Rick's advertisements their (19:25 - 19:30)
advertisements are fake right exactly (19:28 - 19:35)
they advertising the actual game there's (19:30 - 19:38)
I think there's like a whole reply-all (19:35 - 19:40)
episode about that yeah there's been a (19:38 - 19:41)
couple of people talking about that (19:40 - 19:44)
where it's just like well hey I think I (19:41 - 19:46)
just Apple well I guess the ads aren't (19:44 - 19:49)
coming through Apple so that's why they (19:46 - 19:52)
can't restrict it technically masters is (19:49 - 19:55)
DNA yeah and we I had a conversation (19:52 - 19:56)
with DNA about that and technically (19:55 - 20:00)
Pokemon go is knee antic so these DNA (19:56 - 20:02)
kind of danced around the bush for full (20:00 - 20:04)
disclosure I'm partnered with DNA the (20:02 - 20:05)
dance around the bush when I asked leet (20:04 - 20:07)
beat around the bush make it dance (20:05 - 20:09)
around it I don't know you don't play (20:07 - 20:12)
expression fantasy 14 we use expressions (20:09 - 20:14)
that have meaning because of the words (20:12 - 20:17)
that they are made of and the expression (20:14 - 20:19)
is beat around the bush they kind of (20:17 - 20:21)
beat around the bush but they said while (20:19 - 20:26)
they did help make the foundation - Fire (20:21 - 20:27)
Emblem Heroes (20:26 - 20:30)
they have no control they gave it to (20:27 - 20:32)
Nintendo after that and they make the (20:30 - 20:37)
decisions for Pokemon masters obviously (20:32 - 20:38)
they have to have those decisions (20:37 - 20:40)
approved by the Pokemon company but (20:38 - 20:41)
there's no Nintendo involved in that and (20:40 - 20:43)
I kind of see this all the time on like (20:41 - 20:49)
social media of when masters or or or (20:43 - 20:51)
Pokemon go do something wrong people (20:49 - 20:53)
always go well they wouldn't have done (20:51 - 20:56)
this if Nintendo was in charge but we (20:53 - 20:58)
have for Nintendo games right here that (20:56 - 21:00)
are technically run by Nintendo (20:58 - 21:02)
according to DNA they have no (21:00 - 21:03)
involvement once they made the (21:02 - 21:05)
foundation and gave it to him that was (21:03 - 21:07)
all Nintendo makes the money decisions (21:05 - 21:09)
the updates all that stuff and three of (21:07 - 21:10)
the four (21:09 - 21:12)
there's no Mario Kart on this list are (21:10 - 21:17)
not doing well compared to $0.10 games (21:12 - 21:22)
in roblox no Wow is the era of Nintendo (21:17 - 21:23)
coming to an end (21:22 - 21:26)
yep we can go a little bit in depth with (21:23 - 21:32)
this stuff so so this is global gross (21:26 - 21:36)
revenue of 2019 so revenue so that's (21:32 - 21:39)
after this is gross revenue so this is (21:36 - 21:41)
everything they've made before they (21:39 - 21:44)
would take out everything they had to (21:41 - 21:48)
pay for like ads yeah or salaries or (21:44 - 21:51)
anything that would go against how much (21:48 - 21:52)
this makes process this is just how much (21:51 - 21:55)
money they made before you take (21:52 - 21:55)
everything away (21:55 - 21:57)
that's gross revenue okay so this is (21:55 - 22:02)
2019 Super Mario run 7.5 million what (21:57 - 22:05)
which is a lot of money that's a lot of (22:02 - 22:07)
money it's more money than I have Animal (22:05 - 22:11)
Crossing 62 million dragão Gaea lost (22:07 - 22:14)
through a 63 million Fire Emblem hero's (22:11 - 22:17)
a hundred and fifty four million Borton (22:14 - 22:19)
those were all Nintendo games fortnight (22:17 - 22:21)
Mobile bye (22:19 - 22:26)
EPIK 407 million garden scapes will (22:21 - 22:32)
that's you yeah 538 million dollars some (22:26 - 22:36)
of the games way my dollars okay I have (22:32 - 22:40)
not spent more than $50 on Gardens call (22:36 - 22:44)
me yes I the soul garden scapes player (22:40 - 22:46)
and I have spent hundreds of millions of (22:44 - 22:48)
dollars on my horizontal orientation (22:46 - 22:55)
matched trash no monster strike which is (22:48 - 22:58)
by mixi what is monster strike I'm not (22:55 - 23:00)
sure but they've made nine hundred and (22:58 - 23:04)
thirty million dollars so Oh and honor (23:00 - 23:07)
of kings by $0.10 one point seven (23:04 - 23:11)
billion dollars made in 2019 also (23:07 - 23:13)
another one never heard of for the (23:11 - 23:15)
current financial year ending in March (23:13 - 23:17)
Nintendo said it would focus on already (23:15 - 23:19)
released mobile apps and doesn't foresee (23:17 - 23:21)
revenue from the business rising that (23:19 - 23:24)
much the company earned 51 billion yen (23:21 - 23:26)
the smartphone market games and other (23:24 - 23:29)
licensing in 2019 up 11% from earlier (23:26 - 23:33)
period and still only half way to the (23:29 - 23:35)
objective that its president once set (23:33 - 23:38)
Nintendo has not announced what apps it (23:35 - 23:40)
will release next but the chief of its (23:38 - 23:44)
mobile development partner DNA president (23:40 - 23:47)
moriyasu said not to expect any new apps (23:44 - 23:49)
until the end of the current financial (23:47 - 23:53)
year that suggests a long wait until (23:49 - 23:56)
Nintendo's next smartphone game so going (23:53 - 23:57)
back to the DNA conversation they pretty (23:56 - 24:02)
much said how you can tell in the app (23:57 - 24:06)
store is if who who the publisher is or (24:02 - 24:09)
Pokemon TV which isn't necessarily a (24:06 - 24:11)
game but it does say it's the publishers (24:09 - 24:14)
the Pokemon company and then for Pokemon (24:11 - 24:16)
go it says the publishers Niantic for (24:14 - 24:18)
masters it says DNA and then something (24:16 - 24:20)
like Fire Emblem Heroes or Mario Kart or (24:18 - 24:22)
it does say the publisher is Nintendo (24:20 - 24:25)
and oddly enough these ones that are (24:22 - 24:26)
published by Nintendo are the ones that (24:25 - 24:31)
seem to be floundering yeah because we (24:26 - 24:33)
have a whole other article about the (24:31 - 24:35)
crazy amount of money that (24:33 - 24:38)
the antic is making Nintendo's well the (24:35 - 24:40)
exception is Animal Crossing Nintendo's (24:38 - 24:42)
Animal Crossing mobile site 45% uptick (24:40 - 24:44)
in earnings as the switch game was (24:42 - 24:47)
released per sensor towers data but the (24:44 - 24:51)
company doesn't find the but the company (24:47 - 24:52)
doesn't find the square Enix model (24:51 - 24:55)
appear appealing unlike game studios who (24:52 - 24:58)
have to pay a platform fee whether on (24:55 - 25:00)
console or mobile Nintendo has a strong (24:58 - 25:03)
incentive to focus on all gamers all (25:00 - 25:05)
gamers spendings on its own platform (25:03 - 25:06)
where it doesn't have to share its (25:05 - 25:09)
revenue its goal is to send customers (25:06 - 25:11)
from smartphones to consoles not the (25:09 - 25:13)
other way around I skipped a paragraph (25:11 - 25:14)
where they were talking about square (25:13 - 25:16)
enix's games so yeah Animal Crossing (25:14 - 25:19)
pocket camp doing good this year (25:16 - 25:22)
dragalge I lost Super Mario run Fire (25:19 - 25:24)
Emblem not doing good nothing about (25:22 - 25:28)
Mario Cart in this article which was (25:24 - 25:31)
published June 21st probably maybe not (25:28 - 25:32)
anymore (25:31 - 25:36)
Nintendo mobile games in the future (25:32 - 25:39)
until the end of the fiscal year which i (25:36 - 25:41)
think is at it everybody's got different (25:39 - 25:43)
fiscal every different ones (25:41 - 25:45)
I think Nintendo's is or maybe it's (25:43 - 25:47)
March so I think the fiscal year just (25:45 - 25:48)
restarted for them but it also makes (25:47 - 25:50)
sense that Animal Crossing Mobile is (25:48 - 25:51)
doing good because they released an (25:50 - 25:55)
Animal Crossing game yeah is there is (25:51 - 25:57)
there anything you can get from Pocket (25:55 - 26:01)
camp into a new horizons yeah you can (25:57 - 26:05)
get like um signpost and a couple other (26:01 - 26:07)
things but once you transfer you cookie (26:05 - 26:09)
cart yeah the fortune cookie cart the (26:07 - 26:12)
banner signposts the campsite signpost (26:09 - 26:15)
but once you import them you can you'll (26:12 - 26:16)
need anymore (26:15 - 26:18)
you're good that's okay I don't play (26:16 - 26:20)
either game so I did just have (26:18 - 26:22)
Charmander join my staff though so (26:20 - 26:27)
congrats to ya a little cutie we're (26:22 - 26:29)
gonna piggyback off this article to (26:27 - 26:31)
another article that talks about Niantic (26:29 - 26:35)
s-- money and how they've kind of killed (26:31 - 26:38)
it with the revenue here despite (26:35 - 26:42)
coronavirus but we will be (26:38 - 26:46)
take a short break we will be right back (26:42 - 26:46)

community from polygon comm Pokemon go (28:44 - 28:50)
is breaking records despite coronavirus (28:47 - 28:53)
limitations mobile app tracker sensory (28:50 - 28:55)
tower said on Monday that players have (28:53 - 28:57)
spent more in Pokemon go an estimated (28:55 - 28:59)
four hundred and forty five million (28:57 - 29:02)
dollars in the first half of 2020 than (28:59 - 29:03)
in the same time frame of the previous (29:02 - 29:06)
years including the game's first year (29:03 - 29:08)
where Pokemon go took over the world (29:06 - 29:11)
knee antic did not respond for this (29:08 - 29:13)
polygon list everything they've done (29:11 - 29:15)
over (29:13 - 29:17)
kovin 19 we've talked about this before (29:15 - 29:19)
raids that can be done at home daily (29:17 - 29:24)
tasks to tuesday events but that's it (29:19 - 29:27)
that's pretty much it cool they're (29:24 - 29:30)
making a lot of money yeah maybe people (29:27 - 29:32)
are playing (29:30 - 29:36)
more pokemons go just because they have (29:32 - 29:39)
nothing better and I mean you can do it (29:36 - 29:44)
safely outside so there's value in (29:39 - 29:46)
buying the things like lucky eggs and (29:44 - 29:48)
stuff that kind of like well as you're (29:46 - 29:50)
going along help you out they also (29:48 - 29:52)
started they did the genesect event that (29:50 - 29:55)
was eight bucks and the only other big (29:52 - 29:57)
paid event they had I think was the (29:55 - 30:00)
regigigas event before yeah I think I (29:57 - 30:02)
paid for both of those still don't have (30:00 - 30:07)
a regigigas or we're doing the $1 (30:02 - 30:08)
community things (30:07 - 30:10)
yeah I've been buying those and I'm (30:08 - 30:12)
really questioning my life choices there (30:10 - 30:14)
that's only a dollar but that's how they (30:12 - 30:15)
get you right cuz then you're like I do (30:14 - 30:17)
it every time every month I'm giving (30:15 - 30:19)
them at least a dollar well you know (30:17 - 30:20)
what a dollar is gonna get you in garden (30:19 - 30:21)
scapes (30:20 - 30:25)
if it blows not very much because their (30:21 - 30:26)
lowest price item is a dollar (30:25 - 30:32)
ninety-nine yeah remote rate passes I've (30:26 - 30:35)
not bought any here's been problem with (30:32 - 30:38)
remote ray presses that I have a ton of (30:35 - 30:41)
gems but I never know somebody's gonna (30:38 - 30:44)
be in them so again it's the same (30:41 - 30:45)
problem like downtown if I don't hit it (30:44 - 30:47)
within the first two minutes if maybe (30:45 - 30:50)
catch somebody there there's no way I (30:47 - 30:51)
can do a five star rating on my own and (30:50 - 30:55)
I'm not going into a discord I'm not ya (30:51 - 30:58)
know nobody needs that discord drama in (30:55 - 30:59)
their life I think the only time I've (30:58 - 31:02)
done remote raid is when it was like a 1 (30:59 - 31:05)
2 3 star and it had it possibility of (31:02 - 31:08)
being shiny I'm sure there are tons of (31:05 - 31:11)
people that are buying remote ray passes (31:08 - 31:13)
stickers I mean it's probably stickers (31:11 - 31:16)
it's problems layers I will say the (31:13 - 31:17)
balloon thing was pretty clever (31:16 - 31:21)
the balloon thing the rocket team rocket (31:17 - 31:23)
balloons oh yeah yeah oh yeah that's (31:21 - 31:25)

person cares if you wish to stop caring (31:50 - 31:56)
about these things for a mere $14.99 a (31:53 - 31:59)
month will and I you're proud Gen Xers (31:56 - 32:01)
can teach you how to not care about (31:59 - 32:06)
anything apathy is my ingredients yeah (32:01 - 32:08)
we can teach you how to give up your (32:06 - 32:10)
hopes your dreams not care about (32:08 - 32:10)
anything (32:10 - 32:13)
it's our speciality it's why I'm so good (32:10 - 32:15)
at skateboarding I'm so I'm like yeah (32:13 - 32:17)
I've never broken an arm or leg or (32:15 - 32:19)
anything before so it's gotta happen (32:17 - 32:33)
sometime can't hurt worse than life I'm (32:19 - 32:35)
why I did my 50 throws I mean it wasn't (32:33 - 32:37)
super hard I play a lot of Pokemon go (32:35 - 32:41)
pretty pretty okay for me to do the the (32:37 - 32:42)
thing I was gonna bring up is I didn't (32:41 - 32:46)
do any of the what what is this week (32:42 - 32:48)
battle week I think yeah maybe I don't (32:46 - 32:49)
know and I think the first one I think (32:48 - 32:53)
that first task was like defeat one team (32:49 - 32:55)
rocky grunt like level up a pokémon (32:53 - 32:57)
evolve a pokemon or something so I (32:55 - 32:59)
didn't do any of that stuff and I was (32:57 - 33:01)
able to complete the entire quest line (32:59 - 33:04)
and get to the bragging right part in in (33:01 - 33:07)
like 30 minutes just by going to the (33:04 - 33:10)
park during 11 to 2 and then like all (33:07 - 33:12)
the stops were Team Rocket it was really (33:10 - 33:15)
easy to find balloons kept coming down (33:12 - 33:16)
because they boosted balloon rights (33:15 - 33:21)
during that time as well so yeah they my (33:16 - 33:23)
time was respective it was good I (33:21 - 33:25)
thought the event was fun there was (33:23 - 33:28)
literally no one at the park doing it so (33:25 - 33:30)
oh that's your favorite didn't have to (33:28 - 33:32)
talk to anybody didn't have to talk to (33:30 - 33:35)
anyone but uh I mean that Park is that (33:32 - 33:39)
Park is swamps normally when it's a (33:35 - 33:40)
community today I don't know where else (33:39 - 33:43)
players would go to play but maybe also (33:40 - 33:45)
they didn't care that much about Team (33:43 - 33:47)
Rocket compared to comedian a stuff (33:45 - 33:51)
which is probably accurate I'm assuming (33:47 - 33:52)
community is probably still the best (33:51 - 33:55)
grab everyone who's playing the game (33:52 - 33:58)
still and bring them to an it's the same (33:55 - 33:59)
populated area (33:58 - 34:02)
but I am almost done with the the (33:59 - 34:04)
bragging rights here I think it was like (34:02 - 34:08)
it was defeat Giovanni defeat 5 litres (34:04 - 34:10)
defeat 15 grunts all I got to do is I (34:08 - 34:13)
defeated Giovanni got my sweet and (34:10 - 34:16)
I have to just defeat two more rocket (34:13 - 34:17)
leaders (34:16 - 34:19)
so either Sierra cliff or Arlo I've done (34:17 - 34:23)
three out of the five but it ends three (34:19 - 34:25)
days in four hours so that'll be a (34:23 - 34:30)
checkmark off my bragging straight you (34:25 - 34:31)
can brag away and we're gonna teach (34:30 - 34:34)
everybody to not care basically yep I (34:31 - 34:38)
did I mean so I at at lunch today sat (34:34 - 34:41)
out there and hit balloons as they pass (34:38 - 34:45)
by it's just nice I felt no drive to do (34:41 - 34:49)
to do it all like I played some it was (34:45 - 34:52)
cool there were a bunch of like every (34:49 - 34:57)
stop was a Team Rocket stop I did one I (34:52 - 34:59)
was like it's the same I fight a leader (34:57 - 35:03)
like it's the same cool I don't need to (34:59 - 35:08)
do all this I my church so no press let (35:03 - 35:12)
me give you a classic Gen X tactic to (35:08 - 35:15)
deal with somebody if they do come at (35:12 - 35:16)
you with bragging rights all right you (35:15 - 35:19)
ready this is gold here people hated me (35:16 - 35:23)
for this stuff it's called demean them (35:19 - 35:27)
with relational demeaning so if somebody (35:23 - 35:29)
comes up to you and they say I got the (35:27 - 35:31)
blabbity blah blah blah and Pokemon go I (35:29 - 35:33)
did the 50 expert throws bah bah bah bah (35:31 - 35:36)
all you need to say back to them is did (35:33 - 35:38)
you get a coupon for a happy meal with (35:36 - 35:41)
that and then you've just currently just (35:38 - 35:49)
just completely destroyed them yeah more (35:41 - 35:54)
lessons go to Gen X don't care comm 15 (35:49 - 35:57)
course meal I'm sure that is a website I (35:54 - 35:59)
mean it will be as soon as I grab it (35:57 - 36:01)
through GoDaddy i I was worried that (35:59 - 36:04)
this week was gonna be like do (36:01 - 36:08)
masterball battle league stuff which is (36:04 - 36:12)
not fun to anyone and they did Team (36:08 - 36:13)
Rocket stuff it was (36:12 - 36:15)
yeah it was not gonna convince anyone (36:13 - 36:17)
who doesn't like the Team Rocket stuff (36:15 - 36:19)
to do the Team Rocket stuff but if you (36:17 - 36:20)
were indifferent about it and you want (36:19 - 36:23)
to complete these challenges the event (36:20 - 36:26)
was I think good I enjoyed it I enjoyed (36:23 - 36:30)
going out and just doing it and being (36:26 - 36:32)
outside away from people I have not (36:30 - 36:36)
found the male shaped balloon however me (36:32 - 36:38)
either know Jessie and James for me and (36:36 - 36:40)
that is actually something I have been (36:38 - 36:42)
looking for I unify both of them when (36:40 - 36:46)
the balloon comes down I did find Jessie (36:42 - 36:49)
and my Pokemon masters however oh yes (36:46 - 36:52)
look at this perfect transition what (36:49 - 36:53)
would you do without me (36:52 - 36:55)
they put Jessie and James into Pokemon (36:53 - 36:58)
go their balloon comes down they have (36:55 - 37:00)
you can catch shadow (36:58 - 37:03)
Ekans are and coughing because you fight (37:00 - 37:05)
both of them they could both be shiny (37:03 - 37:08)
I've been told that the balloon comes (37:05 - 37:10)
down more often if you don't have a (37:08 - 37:12)
rocket radar activated but it definitely (37:10 - 37:17)
I definitely got Jessie and James twice (37:12 - 37:20)
in the last four three four days with (37:17 - 37:22)
rocket radar but when I didn't have it I (37:20 - 37:24)
seem to have gotten them more but I (37:22 - 37:26)
don't know it could just be luck I think (37:24 - 37:28)
I earned a rocket Raider from some (37:26 - 37:30)
Community Day event recently yes yeah (37:28 - 37:32)
one of the events the genesect Evette I (37:30 - 37:34)
think gave one I think the Reggie event (37:32 - 37:37)
also somebody somebody gave something (37:34 - 37:39)
they added Jessie and James two masters (37:37 - 37:44)
as well and they had dialogue referring (37:39 - 37:46)
to the Koko movie which are you (37:44 - 37:49)
sponsored by the Koko movie no what no (37:46 - 37:51)
should I be can I get on this list where (37:49 - 37:53)
would I blow but you're starting to talk (37:51 - 37:55)
about Pokemon masters so you gotta (37:53 - 38:03)
insert a disclaimer more closer to where (37:55 - 38:05)
I was playing Gardens games correct (38:03 - 38:08)
ruining the show garden escapes is (38:05 - 38:09)
tearing us apart we thought it was gonna (38:08 - 38:14)
be ten cent but it's play Rex hey Rex (38:09 - 38:14)
you gotta say it right up in front (38:15 - 38:21)
proximate to when you start talking (38:19 - 38:23)
about masters otherwise it's just lost (38:21 - 38:26)
in the in what if somebody like was fast (38:23 - 38:26)
forward (38:26 - 38:28)
like I'm only interested in the (38:26 - 38:31)
mass-produce right and then they don't (38:28 - 38:34)
hear the disclaimer it's your city yeah (38:31 - 38:36)
partnered with DNA full disclosure (38:34 - 38:40)
as it turns out so Jesse James do show (38:36 - 38:42)
up in masters I've not done that (38:40 - 38:44)
storyline questline yet I don't know if (38:42 - 38:47)
Greg has done it but mouth makes a (38:44 - 38:50)
reference to trying to find Celebi and (38:47 - 38:55)
shiny Celebi and so rude are part of the (38:50 - 38:57)
new movie Coco which was supposed to (38:55 - 39:03)
debut July 7th 2020 it got delayed for (38:57 - 39:06)
coronavirus so we'll be debuting later (39:03 - 39:11)
in the winter of 2020 but tickets will (39:06 - 39:17)
go on sale in Japan on August 7th or the (39:11 - 39:19)
movie which doesn't have a date but they (39:17 - 39:22)
just went with the event anyways but (39:19 - 39:26)
that's fine I think but it is cool that (39:22 - 39:31)
masters and go like lined up for the (39:26 - 39:33)
event that would have been lined up with (39:31 - 39:35)
the movie that's all that's very very (39:33 - 39:37)
cool this is where you tell us about the (39:35 - 39:40)
Celebi event or they started the tea (39:37 - 39:41)
market stuff oh do you want me to talk (39:40 - 39:44)
about it yeah is it good is it worth it (39:41 - 39:45)
yeah it's a cute little it's a cute (39:44 - 39:46)
little storyline (39:45 - 39:51)
it's very Jessie and James though you (39:46 - 39:54)
know the disaster duo are as disastrous (39:51 - 39:57)
in masters as they are in the anime (39:54 - 40:01)
nothing goes according to plan you are (39:57 - 40:05)
chasing a shiny Celebi fYI cuz it's tied (40:01 - 40:08)
into the movie you want me just spoil (40:05 - 40:10)
what you get at the end but I doubt it's (40:08 - 40:13)
shiny Celebi no you know Jessie joins (40:10 - 40:15)
your team oh okay (40:13 - 40:17)
so she's uh she's a free sync pair yep (40:15 - 40:21)
free 3-star sync pair with Ekans (40:17 - 40:24)
or our buck I forget which I think it (40:21 - 40:27)
seconds I'd have to look again so I just (40:24 - 40:28)
didn't accept like oh sure I'll grab my (40:27 - 40:32)
free sync pair it's a very short story (40:28 - 40:34)
line it's kind of funny yeah it was (40:32 - 40:36)
enjoyable I just burned hurt real quick (40:34 - 40:39)
and then now because of that they have (40:36 - 40:40)
the poison training event (40:39 - 40:44)
going on so you can raise that sink pair (40:40 - 40:47)
it's got some pretty good moves bummer (40:44 - 40:50)
that movie get delayed well bummer 2020 (40:47 - 40:50)
exist (40:50 - 40:56)
I guess ya know every day is a gift it's (40:50 - 40:58)
what you make of it oh this is off game (40:56 - 41:02)
rant extremely rare pokemon card sells (40:58 - 41:09)
at an auction for $90,000 no it didn't (41:02 - 41:09)
if you have $90,000 you're not spending (41:10 - 41:20)
it on pokemon cards card it's like once (41:15 - 41:23)
every two months we have a card sold for (41:20 - 41:26)
a high price article the post much like (41:23 - 41:28)
it the pokemon card in question maybe (41:26 - 41:29)
it's the same person buying all these (41:28 - 41:32)
yeah the pokemon card in question is (41:29 - 41:35)
super secret battle number one trainer (41:32 - 41:38)
card it features a holographic starry (41:35 - 41:41)
sky silhouette of Mewtwo it shouldn't (41:38 - 41:44)
come as anyone of a surprise that hasn't (41:41 - 41:46)
heard of it it is a Japanese only card (41:44 - 41:48)
that was given to a winner of seven (41:46 - 41:51)
regional tournaments that was held back (41:48 - 41:55)
in 1999 as such there are only seven of (41:51 - 41:58)
these cards that ever existed and now (41:55 - 42:01)
and of course some may be damaged or not (41:58 - 42:04)
have survived the last 21 years other (42:01 - 42:05)
rare cards that we've talked about the (42:04 - 42:07)
Pikachu illustrator have sold for more (42:05 - 42:10)
money but what makes this card stand out (42:07 - 42:14)
is its condition it received the mint 10 (42:10 - 42:18)
star rating condition well the highest (42:14 - 42:20)
that can be awarded in other words it (42:18 - 42:23)
looks as good as the day it was handed (42:20 - 42:26)
out and a result as a result as a result (42:23 - 42:29)
as a result collectors scrambles to (42:26 - 42:32)
place bids on the card and ultimately (42:29 - 42:35)
push the auctions price to $90,000 even (42:32 - 42:38)
that's impressive well but you know (42:35 - 42:41)
what's really sad is the person that won (42:38 - 42:43)
the auction just bought it so that they (42:41 - 42:46)
could play flip it or rip it (42:43 - 42:46)
it's true anyone buying a $90,000 card (42:52 - 42:58)
probably not concerned about money one (42:56 - 43:00)
bit nope (42:58 - 43:02)

ending to that show and so it's going to (43:35 - 43:42)
end whether and satisfactorily that's (43:39 - 43:46)

no one's switching phones or upgrading (45:29 - 45:37)
for a shirt I hat right I know people (45:33 - 45:38)
that won't even play a game if it's (45:37 - 45:41)
horizontal yeah people are out of their (45:38 - 45:44)
mind really they are well look if you're (45:41 - 45:46)
already using a Samsung phone maybe (45:44 - 45:48)
you're that hardcore and a Pokemon go (45:46 - 45:49)
that you're like well I was gonna (45:48 - 45:50)
upgrade anyway so I might as well (45:49 - 45:52)
upgrade to one of these 5g phones where (45:50 - 45:55)
5g technically doesn't really exist (45:52 - 45:58)
except in like I am NOT gonna get into (45:55 - 46:01)
this with you one Street in Chicago I'm (45:58 - 46:04)
not gonna get into this look just (46:01 - 46:08)
because phone said 5g e18 T's been lying (46:04 - 46:10)
to us for months (46:08 - 46:15)
Wow it's all a matter of perspective if (46:10 - 46:17)
you're gonna go to a tech blog that says (46:15 - 46:20)
butts are only five jeers every every (46:17 - 46:23)
naming convention has been an ad since (46:20 - 46:26)
its started the author's interior was to (46:23 - 46:27)
G everything else has been how they've (46:26 - 46:29)
marketed it so if you're gonna say that (46:27 - 46:31)
this complete there's not enough there's (46:29 - 46:33)
not enough changes you don't get to say (46:31 - 46:36)
that you don't get to decide how a place (46:33 - 46:40)
markets their service you can say that I (46:36 - 46:41)
don't think it's fast enough to qualify (46:40 - 46:44)
for this random marketing term that they (46:41 - 46:47)
slapped on it to say it is faster than (46:44 - 46:49)
what we offered before because it is (46:47 - 46:52)
faster than they offered before because (46:49 - 46:53)
it's not a hardware change doesn't mean (46:52 - 46:55)
is that wasn't a massive software change (46:53 - 46:57)
so to sit there and say well it's not (46:55 - 46:59)
really five G because 5 G's only this (46:57 - 47:02)
type you're out of your mind (46:59 - 47:05)
it's all marketing you are getting a (47:02 - 47:06)
faster (47:05 - 47:08)
speed whether you think it's truly fast (47:06 - 47:11)
enough to qualify for whatever high bar (47:08 - 47:16)
you decided 5g is so ridiculous Wow (47:11 - 47:17)
I thought Steve was the king of the (47:16 - 47:21)
ranch boy the crown has been taken maybe (47:17 - 47:23)
some other places were getting faster (47:21 - 47:25)
speed but there was zero difference in (47:23 - 47:27)
Milwaukee Wisconsin I highly doubt that (47:25 - 47:30)
just not on the apps that you were using (47:27 - 47:32)
it was only for the horizontal apps that (47:30 - 47:34)
they spit on sup look as an AT&T (47:32 - 47:39)
customer Greg I am consistently unhappy (47:34 - 47:39)
welcome to everybody with every cell (47:39 - 47:45)
phone service that they have everybody (47:42 - 47:46)
is consistently unhappy with everything (47:45 - 47:50)
and guess what there are only four cell (47:46 - 47:52)
phone services and two of them are (47:50 - 47:56)
really not even contenders so surprise (47:52 - 47:58)
is the monopoly and they have no (47:56 - 48:00)
interest in making your life better (47:58 - 48:04)
aren't two of emerging yep so really (48:00 - 48:06)
there's three but in reality there's a (48:04 - 48:09)
legend to you there's really only two (48:06 - 48:11)
because even when they merge their (48:09 - 48:13)
slicking to be honest my favors like (48:11 - 48:15)
well I use Boost Mobile I'd like these (48:13 - 48:18)
Boost Mobile it's just a front (48:15 - 48:21)
they still use one of the twos the (48:18 - 48:23)
entire cell network yep it's all fake (48:21 - 48:26)
there are only three people that hold (48:23 - 48:29)
licenses to actually give services it's (48:26 - 48:31)
a huge problem and everybody thinks (48:29 - 48:35)
adding more I think more companies that (48:31 - 48:37)
buy off of somebody's network is a (48:35 - 48:39)
solution it will never get better (48:37 - 48:42)
it's never going to get better I mean (48:39 - 48:44)
there's only so much spectrum that can (48:42 - 48:45)
be purchased and it's been purchased (48:44 - 48:48)
it's been purchasing until they open up (48:45 - 48:51)
another spectrum which every company (48:48 - 48:53)
fights tooth and nail to be the absolute (48:51 - 48:54)
first to get there and buy up all the (48:53 - 48:57)
licenses because they're billions of (48:54 - 48:59)
dollars so though they just opened (48:57 - 49:01)
another spectrum and who bought it three (48:59 - 49:09)
companies went quality podcast we're (49:01 - 49:12)
talking about a digital t-shirt because (49:09 - 49:17)
you buy a brand new 5g phone (49:12 - 49:17)
sure it's okay it's tight I it's kind of (49:17 - 49:22)
are us there there will be Pokemon go (49:20 - 49:25)
players who find out a way to like by (49:22 - 49:28)
the phone and return whatever that (49:25 - 49:30)
already went through my head well those (49:28 - 49:32)
are the wheels were already turning bit (49:30 - 49:34)
I will you are the king of returning (49:32 - 49:37)
stuff yep you got 14 days from purchase (49:34 - 49:40)
do it quick but if it generates a code (49:37 - 49:41)
than the other the other thing is gonna (49:40 - 49:44)
happen the old eBay thing where (49:41 - 49:46)
somebody's gonna get the code they don't (49:44 - 49:47)
care about clothing but they know that (49:46 - 49:49)
there are rabid Pokemon go fans that do (49:47 - 49:54)
and they'll put it up on eBay for $5 you (49:49 - 49:56)
know at the start of this article I said (49:54 - 49:58)
no one would upgrade a phone but I'm (49:56 - 49:59)
actually I take it all back (49:58 - 50:03)
I remember at go fest people waited for (49:59 - 50:06)
plus hours for a t-shirt that then they (50:03 - 50:09)
put on eBay that then sold for like $250 (50:06 - 50:12)
I met just a t-shirt correct it was it's (50:09 - 50:15)
mind-blowing that people fool across the (50:12 - 50:17)
country to go to a go fest - then stand (50:15 - 50:19)
in line for several hours - then get a (50:17 - 50:21)
t-shirt not playing Pokemon go while (50:19 - 50:24)
they're standing in line unreal (50:21 - 50:27)
actually and yet it was too real because (50:24 - 50:30)
it was real yes it was real this is what (50:27 - 50:32)
happens when you care about things (50:30 - 50:36)
lesson to save money through apathy yep (50:32 - 50:41)
