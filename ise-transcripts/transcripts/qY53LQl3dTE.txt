what's up everyone welcome to the 417 episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your hostess bj with me will it is officially July 12th Pokemon treat yourself day I just spent $200 on cologne oh I got two colognes at there Oh de toilette actually but yes hey we have something expensive to talk about this episode but Greg is here I am here do y'all know why all these hot-air balloons are flying over cuz that's that's real that's real sketch do you have one that looks like I'm out no I'm looking for it there's all black balloon it's damaged not good it's the invasion of the emo Vader's yeah boo yeah as of recording this today was the Team Rocket takeover which we talked about last week of hopefully we don't take up too much of your time trainers no we said take over too much of your time and you're like what does that mean what could that possibly be I think it was like Naima or whatever in the chat who was like it's obviously Team Rocket there's an ongoing relationship with me in the Attic which is how much time are you consuming it's been about four years now okay we got a show for you guys we got a little bit of good news we have some mobile news I guess it's referring to all of Nintendo stuff in general we have some TCG stuff is it some cafe mix news because I've been playing some cafe mix no but we can squeeze in some cafe mix I know score bunny is leaving and Sabha Liz coming y-yeah oh no hmm scar bunny is working at my cafe thank you very much well I guess let's jump let's just start with the cafe stuff I have I have not played it there's a reason for that but Greg you've been playing the cafe mix I haven't played the cafe mix okay here's here's the thing okay the cafe owner is clearly evil because the cafe owner is like I'm gonna get you new items that's going to really help but you're Caffe and you know what it does it makes solving the puzzles worse every everything she introduces makes the game harder that is not helping standing in the way of solid progress of me serving sandwiches pancakes waffles tea coffee lattes - sweet Pokemon friends she's like I'm gonna give you cheese I'm like cool why is cheese blocking everything that I can do because that's what cheese do yeah apparently did you get the other half of who's the electric doggie Yammer Yammer did you get the other half of the game I've only seen the uppers but I've never seen the Amber's face you only get the but cake I've only got the but cake the other I think despite it being a tomato sandwich I think the Dugtrio sandwich is my favorite I've seen the Dutch really the amber butts kind of cute too but this cafe owner is straight-up evil evil you didn't play Schieffelin rig I did oh is it better than shuffle it can't be what do you mean it can't be of course it can be that was a possibility out rifle is a masterpiece was one and it had some deterioration towards the end I'll say all good things have come to an end the game play and how the puzzles working cafe mix is vastly different then shuffle like the fact that you are drawing circles are to connect things but what else you're doing is you're trying to shove it's like you're trying to take tomatoes and push them over to this side and so you're trying to not only link but try to link things in a way to push things to where you want them makes cafe mix way more difficult than that shuffle ever was Scheffel is pretty much it was always like you know try to get you know line up the lines this is very much you have so much freedom and movement but a lot of the game is trying to move things on the puzzle or towards or away from certain other items to make them fall in certain spots that it's it's surprisingly more complex than I thought it was going to be there I have lost I have lost puzzles multiple multiple times because I can't figure out exactly how to loop things around to move the tomato over the basket because it doesn't have that much give but if you think it should it's a surprisingly complex game and then she adds more complexity I don't need honey stop it I really like this art style it's like watercolors animation to start it out Wow and that Evie it's so happy it got a little play the Evie pancakes will have you not played I just started well I guess we'll come back next week to see if it's better than garden scapes for you I mean that's a tough stretch yeah it's it's a very good game like I'm surprised that I'm just like oh I have five minutes I'm gonna go try a couple of puzzles and often in that five minutes I have not been able to figure out how to work through the puzzle that I'm currently on alright I'm confused I just walked through the door of this restaurant and the waitress Leah said hello to me and then she said you must be the owner I yeah if you work for me what make my life difficult well but also how do you not know who I am what kind of bizarre hiring profit process did we have that I didn't we didn't meet and you're already serving people at my restaurant this is a dojo situation everybody surprised that you are who you at you don't match what I thought you were hmm I'm assuming phone not switch phone I'm phoning it up right now okay can I tell you why I haven't played this game yet it's possibly the dumbest reason in the entire world because you're not sponsored by the Pokemon company international and you will play any mobile games unless that company sponsors you or has a relationship or whatever that word is that you use no that's not it if you guess the two aren't linked no that's not it either it's dumber than that it's it I think that like for people listening this podcast can relate to me here this has a huge play should go I hate any app that requires me to turn my phone sideways why I cannot stand it is this why you haven't played garden scapes yet I didn't know garden scapes was horizontal but now I'm interested how do you watch videos I just suck it up and hold it vertically I just wow you that can relate like two minutes I am NOT like swiping down turning off orientation lock turning the phone you can meditation lock on 24/7 let me tell you what's always on my phone do not disturb always on orientation lock always on forever and ever because when I'm laying in bed checking Twitter or checking a website on Safari I do not need the like phone to like decide whether it should be horizontal and not horizontal hundred-percent happens oh look what your hand I also want us to flashback to the past where he was like we have to have autosave because people drop their switches and lose all their data wallet what are you doing and do you live on an earthquake is that where you guys located in the sword and shield world I have I've had that game crash at least four times in the last you're pushing it you push the limits that's the probably no more than four probably three to four times or to save a save me I you don't want to turn my phone sideways sleeper like if you're if you're on your side and your your head is on the pillow your body is awesome mattress no no no no because number one yes I am a side sleeper I if I try to sleep on my back I don't sleep because that's if I try to sleep on my stomach no I am a side sleeper but and this is the important component when I'm goofing around on my phone in bed I prop up two pillows on the headboard and I sit up in the bed and goof on my phone ready for sleep the phone goes away I turn on my side and I go to sleep like a gentle sweet little baby angel that I am it video entertainment is not for the bed that also agree you do those things away from the place that you sleeps that you are associate the bed with sleeping and not a million other things that keep you awake there's no TV in the bedroom there's two VMs watching the in the bedroom that is a recipe for an unhappy marriage and life this is my bedroom it's like I have a chair I have a bedside table I have a bed no TV no electronics you do not need electronics mucking up your sleep schedule you do not contrary to somebody's belief need properties brothers boring show to love you in latency and in deliciousness yes you should be sitting in a chair freely moving your arms so you can watch videos and the proper orientation oh my guess what I'm laying in bed I do not need I need orientation lock on all the time I do not want to turn my phone sideways like are you telling me you guys you guys like open a sixteen by nine video on Twitter that's like 20 seconds and you turn your phone sideways for that if it's 20 seconds no what 20 second video watch take a video on my watch again Twitter that I think this is worth my 20 seconds there has never been anything on Twitter me finding a shiny pokemon me opening a good pack of cards me saying something very funny that never happens I generally have watched that live on the TV downstairs yeah and if it was actually entertaining you would have texted it to us there's a when you don't we're like yep can that Garbo content oh my god I don't really honestly if if if I want to watch a video I do the thing where I like start the video on my phone and I hit the little button and then my TV comes on and the video is playing on my TV yep when it's like Monday or Tuesday morning at like 2 a.m. and I'm watching wrestling clips that are all probably 30 seconds long I do not need to watch them or I do not need to watch them in 16 by 9 because of social I have counted for poor life choices in that sentence going back to games there's I don't want to turn my phone sideways poke my Master's vertical love it Pokemon go vertical love it a clash Royale used to love it used to play it a lot vertical cafe mix not vertical you know it was vertical Magikarp jump awesome game Pokemon shuffle awesome game Pokemon duel unfortunately not the exception here but at least it was vertical I want I don't want horizontal games on my phone are garbage I told you of a bad reason going in but that is true he did advertise what's that I'm confident there is a couple people that can relate that they do want to turn their phone sideways you don't even have to press a button to make it go horizontal you can literally do the most simple hand gesture and it does it for you no I cuz I need orientation lock on I don't want that I do you don't need orientation if there's an earthquake a meteor coming down what if deoxys comes out of it I need vertical missed in my life if the axis is porous out of the sky you are not sitting in your bed on your phone I can give you one guarantee in this world universe reality if deoxys were to come to this planet deoxys is not coming to Milwaukee all right true and this is Oktoberfest in July okay this is off this is all Pokemon calm three movies up on Pokemon TV pokémon the movie Koopa and the classic clash of Ages haven't seen that one myself pokémon the movie volcanion and mechanical marvel everything sat like two weeks ago our simply the worst forms and then pokemon the movie I choose you all free Pokemon TV app of them I would say I choose you as the one to watch yeah probably I haven't seen the Hoople wasn't though so I don't know I think I've seen the one I here's the thing I don't remember it and the only thing I remember about Canion movie is ash somehow changes clothes while bound to volcania that's very true the Hupa movie features the a lot of different like mythical x' and stuff because the Hupa calls them through the hoops and it's like the little hoopla and the big hoop up both yes the entire plot at the movie this is off Bloomberg according to their website this is my last free article otherwise I have to pay $6 a month this is a Nintendo chills mobile ambitions after animal Crossing's success Nintendo is retreating from the 77 billion dollar mobile gaming arena after disappointing results deflated once lofty ambitions entering a multi-year effort just as the market goes through an unprecedent Cova era boom president foo acara proclaimed two years ago that smartphone games would be 1 billion business with personal growth potential building on the processors that promised Nintendo would release 2 to 3 mobile titles each year created hopes among investors that gaming powerhouses could carve out a substantial slice of the market in May however the president adopted a market marked differently toon saying quote we are not necessarily looking to continue to release many new applications for the mobile market end quote Nintendo's shares slid 4% day after the remark close observers might have sense that Nintendo was growing disillusioned with the mobile realm even earlier at smartphone games were projected its smartphone games project was born out of this necessity to shore up the bottom line of the we used failure now riding a surge in switch popularity and investor confidence the kyoto based company appears to have reassessed the mobile business and narrowed its focused on its own console ecosystem in a period through February through May when other studios were posting record earnings alongside Kovan lockdowns sensor tower data showed Marquis Nintendo titles like Super Mario run plummeting by double digits at the same time Nintendo's own Animal Crossing new horizons just became a quintessential haven from virus anxiety powering the switch console to new heights and of popularity and pushing the company's share price to a 12-year high last week mobile games are expected to make up 77 billion this year which would account for half the overall game industry according to research from new zoo but since the release of Mario Kart tour in fall of 2019 Nintendo's mobile pipeline is empty alright there's a little bit more to the article but we'll stop there right now cuz well how many of Nintendo's mobile games have been horizontal versus vertical because obviously that's determining your success in the marketplace I have I have a graph here this is a bunch of different games so we have drag algea lost Super Mario run Fire Emblem and Animal Crossing pocket camp all Nintendo garden escapes which is by play Rick's roblox which is by roblox rise of kingdom by lift games and pub G mobile buy 10 cent boy when we come become what when 10 cent buys us a yeah so drag out gia lost Super Mario run and Fire Emblem heroes all in the negative Animal Crossing pocket camp the only Nintendo game in the positive up by about 50% and then garden escapes is a up a hundred percent roblox one hundred and twenty rise of kingdoms one hundred thirty and then pub G mobile up one hundred fifty percent due to the pandemic three out of four of Nintendo's mobile games not doing too hot yeah also they don't advertise them I mean I'm sure they do they probably advertise them on Facebook and believe me I have seen advertisements for all the ones that make a lot of money and I've yet to see an advertisement for Super Mario in like it's not on my phone I don't have it I never see it I have never seen one for Animal Crossing pocket gap they don't come up and like is not a secret on my phone like they would look that I have the Nintendo stuff and send it to me I don't see them I don't see them Facebook I don't see them on Twitter I don't see them my Instagram I literally do not ever see them advertised yeah I only get the really crummy games advertised the garbage kids yeah that's one of them yeah because well the pranking raisa kingdoms all the time I got one what is that one that's always on YouTube rage shadow legends I don't get that well wait maybe I do is that the one where they have like the characters from the game are angry because they're not good at playing the game probably so the assured garden escapes and the issue with play Rick's advertisements their advertisements are fake right exactly they advertising the actual game there's I think there's like a whole reply-all episode about that yeah there's been a couple of people talking about that where it's just like well hey I think I just Apple well I guess the ads aren't coming through Apple so that's why they can't restrict it technically masters is DNA yeah and we I had a conversation with DNA about that and technically Pokemon go is knee antic so these DNA kind of danced around the bush for full disclosure I'm partnered with DNA the dance around the bush when I asked leet beat around the bush make it dance around it I don't know you don't play expression fantasy 14 we use expressions that have meaning because of the words that they are made of and the expression is beat around the bush they kind of beat around the bush but they said while they did help make the foundation - Fire Emblem Heroes they have no control they gave it to Nintendo after that and they make the decisions for Pokemon masters obviously they have to have those decisions approved by the Pokemon company but there's no Nintendo involved in that and I kind of see this all the time on like social media of when masters or or or Pokemon go do something wrong people always go well they wouldn't have done this if Nintendo was in charge but we have for Nintendo games right here that are technically run by Nintendo according to DNA they have no involvement once they made the foundation and gave it to him that was all Nintendo makes the money decisions the updates all that stuff and three of the four there's no Mario Kart on this list are not doing well compared to $0.10 games in roblox no Wow is the era of Nintendo coming to an end yep we can go a little bit in depth with this stuff so so this is global gross revenue of 2019 so revenue so that's after this is gross revenue so this is everything they've made before they would take out everything they had to pay for like ads yeah or salaries or anything that would go against how much this makes process this is just how much money they made before you take everything away that's gross revenue okay so this is 2019 Super Mario run 7.5 million what which is a lot of money that's a lot of money it's more money than I have Animal Crossing 62 million dragão Gaea lost through a 63 million Fire Emblem hero's a hundred and fifty four million Borton those were all Nintendo games fortnight Mobile bye EPIK 407 million garden scapes will that's you yeah 538 million dollars some of the games way my dollars okay I have not spent more than $50 on Gardens call me yes I the soul garden scapes player and I have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on my horizontal orientation matched trash no monster strike which is by mixi what is monster strike I'm not sure but they've made nine hundred and thirty million dollars so Oh and honor of kings by $0.10 one point seven billion dollars made in 2019 also another one never heard of for the current financial year ending in March Nintendo said it would focus on already released mobile apps and doesn't foresee revenue from the business rising that much the company earned 51 billion yen the smartphone market games and other licensing in 2019 up 11% from earlier period and still only half way to the objective that its president once set Nintendo has not announced what apps it will release next but the chief of its mobile development partner DNA president moriyasu said not to expect any new apps until the end of the current financial year that suggests a long wait until Nintendo's next smartphone game so going back to the DNA conversation they pretty much said how you can tell in the app store is if who who the publisher is or Pokemon TV which isn't necessarily a game but it does say it's the publishers the Pokemon company and then for Pokemon go it says the publishers Niantic for masters it says DNA and then something like Fire Emblem Heroes or Mario Kart or it does say the publisher is Nintendo and oddly enough these ones that are published by Nintendo are the ones that seem to be floundering yeah because we have a whole other article about the crazy amount of money that the antic is making Nintendo's well the exception is Animal Crossing Nintendo's Animal Crossing mobile site 45% uptick in earnings as the switch game was released per sensor towers data but the company doesn't find the but the company doesn't find the square Enix model appear appealing unlike game studios who have to pay a platform fee whether on console or mobile Nintendo has a strong incentive to focus on all gamers all gamers spendings on its own platform where it doesn't have to share its revenue its goal is to send customers from smartphones to consoles not the other way around I skipped a paragraph where they were talking about square enix's games so yeah Animal Crossing pocket camp doing good this year dragalge I lost Super Mario run Fire Emblem not doing good nothing about Mario Cart in this article which was published June 21st probably maybe not anymore Nintendo mobile games in the future until the end of the fiscal year which i think is at it everybody's got different fiscal every different ones I think Nintendo's is or maybe it's March so I think the fiscal year just restarted for them but it also makes sense that Animal Crossing Mobile is doing good because they released an Animal Crossing game yeah is there is there anything you can get from Pocket camp into a new horizons yeah you can get like um signpost and a couple other things but once you transfer you cookie cart yeah the fortune cookie cart the banner signposts the campsite signpost but once you import them you can you'll need anymore you're good that's okay I don't play either game so I did just have Charmander join my staff though so congrats to ya a little cutie we're gonna piggyback off this article to another article that talks about Niantic s-- money and how they've kind of killed it with the revenue here despite coronavirus but we will be take a short break we will be right back no turn that slap hands life I've been wearing sweat pants for a long time let's let them dance boys during that slender dance two things before we talk about the rest of the news number one is we have t-shirts I feel like I keep forgetting I mentioned this but if you want a t-shirt be in the show notes of the podcast episode number two is if you have not done your weekly reminder for the podcast awards also in the show notes but we're trying to get nominated for the 15th annual podcast Awards we tried this a long time ago we tried this like seven years ago we're trying to get in this year because I think we can do it so if you have not voted please vote there in the nomination stage so they're trying to narrow down who the finalists will be in each category we're going for people's choice and why everyone's going from People's Choice literally the People's Choice and the other one is gaming video games oh I didn't know that you were in two categories I got to go back and vote you can change your vote up to July 31st it locks it in that night and then we'll figure out who the final nominees are on August 1st and then we got to vote again that was the easier vote so if you want to vote that would super super help us out and that's your weekly reminder speaking of video games this is from James in our slack community from polygon comm Pokemon go is breaking records despite coronavirus limitations mobile app tracker sensory tower said on Monday that players have spent more in Pokemon go an estimated four hundred and forty five million dollars in the first half of 2020 than in the same time frame of the previous years including the game's first year where Pokemon go took over the world knee antic did not respond for this polygon list everything they've done over kovin 19 we've talked about this before raids that can be done at home daily tasks to tuesday events but that's it that's pretty much it cool they're making a lot of money yeah maybe people are playing more pokemons go just because they have nothing better and I mean you can do it safely outside so there's value in buying the things like lucky eggs and stuff that kind of like well as you're going along help you out they also started they did the genesect event that was eight bucks and the only other big paid event they had I think was the regigigas event before yeah I think I paid for both of those still don't have a regigigas or we're doing the $1 community things yeah I've been buying those and I'm really questioning my life choices there that's only a dollar but that's how they get you right cuz then you're like I do it every time every month I'm giving them at least a dollar well you know what a dollar is gonna get you in garden scapes if it blows not very much because their lowest price item is a dollar ninety-nine yeah remote rate passes I've not bought any here's been problem with remote ray presses that I have a ton of gems but I never know somebody's gonna be in them so again it's the same problem like downtown if I don't hit it within the first two minutes if maybe catch somebody there there's no way I can do a five star rating on my own and I'm not going into a discord I'm not ya know nobody needs that discord drama in their life I think the only time I've done remote raid is when it was like a 1 2 3 star and it had it possibility of being shiny I'm sure there are tons of people that are buying remote ray passes stickers I mean it's probably stickers it's problems layers I will say the balloon thing was pretty clever the balloon thing the rocket team rocket balloons oh yeah yeah oh yeah that's what we're gonna talk I forgot that we were gonna transition into this see what I do for you and you're like ooh I like the team rocket event today I thought it was good they did respect my time I did not do okay so did you guys finish your 50 excellent throws no brainer right oh heck no their star here finished bragging rights only matter if the probe the other person cares if you wish to stop caring about these things for a mere $14.99 a month will and I you're proud Gen Xers can teach you how to not care about anything apathy is my ingredients yeah we can teach you how to give up your hopes your dreams not care about anything it's our speciality it's why I'm so good at skateboarding I'm so I'm like yeah I've never broken an arm or leg or anything before so it's gotta happen sometime can't hurt worse than life I'm why I did my 50 throws I mean it wasn't super hard I play a lot of Pokemon go pretty pretty okay for me to do the the thing I was gonna bring up is I didn't do any of the what what is this week battle week I think yeah maybe I don't know and I think the first one I think that first task was like defeat one team rocky grunt like level up a pokémon evolve a pokemon or something so I didn't do any of that stuff and I was able to complete the entire quest line and get to the bragging right part in in like 30 minutes just by going to the park during 11 to 2 and then like all the stops were Team Rocket it was really easy to find balloons kept coming down because they boosted balloon rights during that time as well so yeah they my time was respective it was good I thought the event was fun there was literally no one at the park doing it so oh that's your favorite didn't have to talk to anybody didn't have to talk to anyone but uh I mean that Park is that Park is swamps normally when it's a community today I don't know where else players would go to play but maybe also they didn't care that much about Team Rocket compared to comedian a stuff which is probably accurate I'm assuming community is probably still the best grab everyone who's playing the game still and bring them to an it's the same populated area but I am almost done with the the bragging rights here I think it was like it was defeat Giovanni defeat 5 litres defeat 15 grunts all I got to do is I defeated Giovanni got my sweet and I have to just defeat two more rocket leaders so either Sierra cliff or Arlo I've done three out of the five but it ends three days in four hours so that'll be a checkmark off my bragging straight you can brag away and we're gonna teach everybody to not care basically yep I did I mean so I at at lunch today sat out there and hit balloons as they pass by it's just nice I felt no drive to do to do it all like I played some it was cool there were a bunch of like every stop was a Team Rocket stop I did one I was like it's the same I fight a leader like it's the same cool I don't need to do all this I my church so no press let me give you a classic Gen X tactic to deal with somebody if they do come at you with bragging rights all right you ready this is gold here people hated me for this stuff it's called demean them with relational demeaning so if somebody comes up to you and they say I got the blabbity blah blah blah and Pokemon go I did the 50 expert throws bah bah bah bah all you need to say back to them is did you get a coupon for a happy meal with that and then you've just currently just just completely destroyed them yeah more lessons go to Gen X don't care comm 15 course meal I'm sure that is a website I mean it will be as soon as I grab it through GoDaddy i I was worried that this week was gonna be like do masterball battle league stuff which is not fun to anyone and they did Team Rocket stuff it was yeah it was not gonna convince anyone who doesn't like the Team Rocket stuff to do the Team Rocket stuff but if you were indifferent about it and you want to complete these challenges the event was I think good I enjoyed it I enjoyed going out and just doing it and being outside away from people I have not found the male shaped balloon however me either know Jessie and James for me and that is actually something I have been looking for I unify both of them when the balloon comes down I did find Jessie and my Pokemon masters however oh yes look at this perfect transition what would you do without me they put Jessie and James into Pokemon go their balloon comes down they have you can catch shadow Ekans are and coughing because you fight both of them they could both be shiny I've been told that the balloon comes down more often if you don't have a rocket radar activated but it definitely I definitely got Jessie and James twice in the last four three four days with rocket radar but when I didn't have it I seem to have gotten them more but I don't know it could just be luck I think I earned a rocket Raider from some Community Day event recently yes yeah one of the events the genesect Evette I think gave one I think the Reggie event also somebody somebody gave something they added Jessie and James two masters as well and they had dialogue referring to the Koko movie which are you sponsored by the Koko movie no what no should I be can I get on this list where would I blow but you're starting to talk about Pokemon masters so you gotta insert a disclaimer more closer to where I was playing Gardens games correct ruining the show garden escapes is tearing us apart we thought it was gonna be ten cent but it's play Rex hey Rex you gotta say it right up in front proximate to when you start talking about masters otherwise it's just lost in the in what if somebody like was fast forward like I'm only interested in the mass-produce right and then they don't hear the disclaimer it's your city yeah partnered with DNA full disclosure as it turns out so Jesse James do show up in masters I've not done that storyline questline yet I don't know if Greg has done it but mouth makes a reference to trying to find Celebi and shiny Celebi and so rude are part of the new movie Coco which was supposed to debut July 7th 2020 it got delayed for coronavirus so we'll be debuting later in the winter of 2020 but tickets will go on sale in Japan on August 7th or the movie which doesn't have a date but they just went with the event anyways but that's fine I think but it is cool that masters and go like lined up for the event that would have been lined up with the movie that's all that's very very cool this is where you tell us about the Celebi event or they started the tea market stuff oh do you want me to talk about it yeah is it good is it worth it yeah it's a cute little it's a cute little storyline it's very Jessie and James though you know the disaster duo are as disastrous in masters as they are in the anime nothing goes according to plan you are chasing a shiny Celebi fYI cuz it's tied into the movie you want me just spoil what you get at the end but I doubt it's shiny Celebi no you know Jessie joins your team oh okay so she's uh she's a free sync pair yep free 3-star sync pair with Ekans or our buck I forget which I think it seconds I'd have to look again so I just didn't accept like oh sure I'll grab my free sync pair it's a very short story line it's kind of funny yeah it was enjoyable I just burned hurt real quick and then now because of that they have the poison training event going on so you can raise that sink pair it's got some pretty good moves bummer that movie get delayed well bummer 2020 exist I guess ya know every day is a gift it's what you make of it oh this is off game rant extremely rare pokemon card sells at an auction for $90,000 no it didn't if you have $90,000 you're not spending it on pokemon cards card it's like once every two months we have a card sold for a high price article the post much like it the pokemon card in question maybe it's the same person buying all these yeah the pokemon card in question is super secret battle number one trainer card it features a holographic starry sky silhouette of Mewtwo it shouldn't come as anyone of a surprise that hasn't heard of it it is a Japanese only card that was given to a winner of seven regional tournaments that was held back in 1999 as such there are only seven of these cards that ever existed and now and of course some may be damaged or not have survived the last 21 years other rare cards that we've talked about the Pikachu illustrator have sold for more money but what makes this card stand out is its condition it received the mint 10 star rating condition well the highest that can be awarded in other words it looks as good as the day it was handed out and a result as a result as a result as a result collectors scrambles to place bids on the card and ultimately push the auctions price to $90,000 even that's impressive well but you know what's really sad is the person that won the auction just bought it so that they could play flip it or rip it it's true anyone buying a $90,000 card probably not concerned about money one bit nope yeah Jeff Bezos in your Pokemon card collecting habits Episode six of twilight wings now available meaning that there is one more episode of Twilight wings to go do we is it gonna resolve are we gonna find out what happened no the little boy Tommy went a minute as you wish ah if you watch episode

thirteenth to claim a free tie-dyed t-shirt in a tie-dye hat to match your avatars this offer is only available for one week to summer of Galaxy participants there will be plenty of more go news as we closer to the event be sure to check back that's actually interesting that it's clothing but I guess like if you were I guess somebody could log I wonder how I wonder how it works doesn't really go in depth how it works what do you like log into the Samsung portal get the code redeem the code so you could give the code to somebody you have zero people in this room the u.s. Android device yeah well I wouldn't have brought up the news if it was like ten free pokeballs it's that actual shirt and hat for in-game in-game yeah miss kind of be a code right somehow no one's switching phones or upgrading for a shirt I hat right I know people that won't even play a game if it's horizontal yeah people are out of their mind really they are well look if you're already using a Samsung phone maybe you're that hardcore and a Pokemon go that you're like well I was gonna upgrade anyway so I might as well upgrade to one of these 5g phones where 5g technically doesn't really exist except in like I am NOT gonna get into this with you one Street in Chicago I'm not gonna get into this look just because phone said 5g e18 T's been lying to us for months Wow it's all a matter of perspective if you're gonna go to a tech blog that says butts are only five jeers every every naming convention has been an ad since its started the author's interior was to G everything else has been how they've marketed it so if you're gonna say that this complete there's not enough there's not enough changes you don't get to say that you don't get to decide how a place markets their service you can say that I don't think it's fast enough to qualify for this random marketing term that they slapped on it to say it is faster than what we offered before because it is faster than they offered before because it's not a hardware change doesn't mean is that wasn't a massive software change so to sit there and say well it's not really five G because 5 G's only this type you're out of your mind it's all marketing you are getting a faster speed whether you think it's truly fast enough to qualify for whatever high bar you decided 5g is so ridiculous Wow I thought Steve was the king of the ranch boy the crown has been taken maybe some other places were getting faster speed but there was zero difference in Milwaukee Wisconsin I highly doubt that just not on the apps that you were using it was only for the horizontal apps that they spit on sup look as an AT&T customer Greg I am consistently unhappy welcome to everybody with every cell phone service that they have everybody is consistently unhappy with everything and guess what there are only four cell phone services and two of them are really not even contenders so surprise is the monopoly and they have no interest in making your life better aren't two of emerging yep so really there's three but in reality there's a legend to you there's really only two because even when they merge their slicking to be honest my favors like well I use Boost Mobile I'd like these Boost Mobile it's just a front they still use one of the twos the entire cell network yep it's all fake there are only three people that hold licenses to actually give services it's a huge problem and everybody thinks adding more I think more companies that buy off of somebody's network is a solution it will never get better it's never going to get better I mean there's only so much spectrum that can be purchased and it's been purchased it's been purchasing until they open up another spectrum which every company fights tooth and nail to be the absolute first to get there and buy up all the licenses because they're billions of dollars so though they just opened another spectrum and who bought it three companies went quality podcast we're talking about a digital t-shirt because you buy a brand new 5g phone sure it's okay it's tight I it's kind of are us there there will be Pokemon go players who find out a way to like by the phone and return whatever that already went through my head well those are the wheels were already turning bit I will you are the king of returning stuff yep you got 14 days from purchase do it quick but if it generates a code than the other the other thing is gonna happen the old eBay thing where somebody's gonna get the code they don't care about clothing but they know that there are rabid Pokemon go fans that do and they'll put it up on eBay for $5 you know at the start of this article I said no one would upgrade a phone but I'm actually I take it all back I remember at go fest people waited for plus hours for a t-shirt that then they put on eBay that then sold for like $250 I met just a t-shirt correct it was it's mind-blowing that people fool across the country to go to a go fest - then stand in line for several hours - then get a t-shirt not playing Pokemon go while they're standing in line unreal actually and yet it was too real because it was real yes it was real this is what happens when you care about things lesson to save money through apathy yep Greg yes question of the week the time is he here for the question of the week this is from Brandon imagine that the ISE anniversary I see and each of you want to give a Pokemon to each of the other as a gift which one would you gift and why I already know I'm done Steve gets Steve gets to Rocchi will gets Victini Oh am I used to you thank my mythical and legendary co-hosts with all my love for all these years I give you your favorite mythical x' and a guilt trip top that that's like I mean just because you were first in line doesn't mean that you get to pour guilt over everybody else right you don't get the bucket of guilt yeah they told us out there I already yeah the bucket of guilt turned horizontal though the thoughtfulness of your gift does not make mine too thoughtless so I will give you a crow a gong and I will give Steve the best Pokemon of them all cordially there you go why shows how much
