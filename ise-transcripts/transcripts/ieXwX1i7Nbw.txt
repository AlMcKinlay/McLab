[Music] so [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 464th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i am your host sbj with me is will i sure i don't know where i am in space and time this week i feel i literally like got off of work 15 minutes ago it i'm operating a conference for work i'm hosting sessions i i got you guys are getting the last dregs of will anderson here all right usually you're cheery and positive and full of joy sunday will that's not thursday though so thursday will's a very different will we're getting we're getting the bottom of the well well the very bottom is friday but yeah we at least we're not there yet uh we are recording on a thursday evening because i will be with you two on sunday uh in what state in minnesota and you spelled that how uh my ssi ppi system uh greg here i am here welcome welcome i got my original stitch shirt today i'm very excited if you're watching the video oh they have to watch the youtube to see that yeah yeah i'm sorry or check my socials we have listeners who listen to the podcast and then when they're done they go to the youtube and watch it we love those people those are number one the true fans and number two those are the people who understand there's okay right two problems that those folks don't have number one they don't confuse me for steve and vice versa which listener only people seem to do wait really i thought it was like they confused you and greg people oh my voice is too high whatever your two voices are somewhat similar i'm at the higher end and always sound like i'm the one with the fake accent that's why i hate the fake accent so people don't yeah also number two those people have a true especially this week of all weeks have a true visual key to the difference between will and greg greg is bright colorful roserade flowers will looks like he just got back for a funeral for a hipster lp and i mean vinyl record collector yes you are it was a very casual funeral i said a hipster very casual everybody's just kids this is pretty much the day-to-day for william anderson the easy way to tell the voice between will and i is i stutter will does not have no no there there was like one time that you accused like new york city of being full of rats or something and people came after me and i'm like i am from new york and i know it's full of friends there are more rats in new york city than there are people you know you know where the rats are is dc you know where they are no chicago no did you hear they had to release feral cats onto the streets of chicago to get rid of they released feral cats and people accusing greg of like of defaming chicago all these years i'm like no no there's legit proof they did a bunch of purloin in meowth to take care of the rattata problem all right well we got a lot to talk about this week we do we do we look it's thursday i we have that we have one important news item that we had better get to that i posted last time and you said well get back to it we would we it's on the list we'd better be it's on the list we got we got a lot of talk to talk about we always do look oh we could have one news article and i'd be like we have had a news article from the past you went back 10 years to pull up an article and we still did like two hours on it i have another one but we're saving that for a slow news league how what get what is slow yeah what is slower than the 25th anniversary that's like that's the real question no we have we have a lot of little stuff this week we get last week we had two build-a-bears do we have a bill to be no no build-a-bear we have no items in the pokemon center bunny is the newest item at build-a-bear is uh really is it cute yeah it's fine it's a square buddy oh for crepe is uh what's his name evie lover what what's his name together lover yoga pillow is he back is he back i don't think i look every once in a while and i put out into the universe to run into togepi lover and it has never manifested that's why on twitch our little heart is a togepi it was a reference to togepi lover deep cuts here that is such a lie no this one that's literally why the heart that on my twitch channel is a togepi heart is to signify our love for togepi lover is that a big teeny in front of your microphone yeah it is that's the most the most joy we're getting out of will this episode i mean steve's got a munchlax i do have a munchlax i do yeah also i was this is where i failed i was going to say you need to get rid of those rolls of toilet paper and i have 30 rolls of bts toilet paper which you will never use are you seriously going to move that to minnesota no i'll probably okay we will eventually here's the here's the problem before we go they become worthless okay the h mart in chicago had like three full aisles dedicated to this toilet paper if i need more i'll go back but one they were the sh the show is secretly called two things number one first thing is uh they do sell this on ebay i'm not sure who's buying it number two is i have the world's smallest bathroom and normally irene and i 100 certified truth yes uh normally irene and i we buy like the six pack of toilet paper because that's all that fits in our closet outside the bathroom this is 30 rolls i can't put it anywhere besides this room right now i have no space for it and you're never going to open it it would devalue ebay scalpers will be like are all 30 rolls in there and you know she's like nah the truest bts fans are using the toilet paper no they're not the truest the truest bts fans are buying the meal and then freeze locking it in a case to say these were the meals they will never touch that food yeah that's probably accurate um okay well let's get into pokemon news uh happy pride uh there's a new tournament uh it is called the fair and square pokemon competition so it's only square pokemon there's no that would be a cool rule um but this is uh series nine rules for pokemon sword and shield the it is single battles so i'm already passing uh duplicate pokemon and duplicate items are allowed and legendary single yeah i don't know because some people enjoyed that i mean i know but it seems weird that this is like after all these years a lot of these like off tournaments haven't have been singles uh unlike series nine regulations duplicate pokemon duplicate items are allowed and legendary pokemon are prohibited uh you cannot use pokemon like zapdos or shifu silvally the ultra beasts um by taking part in this challenge you will earn a participation of 50 battle points that's all you get no shirt nothing fancy they made a cool graphic for it though i guess it's like pink and gal isopod is on it that's cool it's it's i they definitely have a rainbow vibe in the sound wave or sound file thing that's in the back and i'm not understanding i don't understand that i don't understand the whole i regret is it cool looking graphic i don't understand what in there says fair and square the definitely not the wav files they grabbed off google and rainbows i wish there was so in ultrasound ultra moon there was like a lot of like fun tournaments like there was like a halloween tournament where you could only use like ghost type pokemon and like pikachu because obviously you can always have you can't have a tournament that pikachu um there was like a tournament at one point in ultrasound ultramoon where you could only use pokemon that were like a certain height and if they were above that height they were disqualified oh right i remember that these these have kind of like they've been doing a great job at you know changing the rules banning pokemon adding new pokemon all that stuff but their side things have been a little lackluster i don't know somebody probably get joy out of it i'm sure somebody who likes singles are probably pretty excited maybe uh moving on to some pokemon masters news uh oh yeah yeah we we as uh we the collective pokemon community got the six thousand free gems for doing the x amount of battles in game uh almost missed it but we got it did i get maxi or archie uh i hold on let me read the i i'm gonna think about your choice i think i know what it is because there's only one right choice here but this is off pokemon.com scout archie and kyogre and maxie and groudon in pokemon masters the land and sea awaken event have subsided in pokemon masters ex but team aqua and team magma are not done with passio yet the two team leaders have stopped stormed i like stomped uh they have stormed into the singapore scouts so you can add them to your partner's legendary pokemon to your team look out for archie uh sync pair from may 31st to june 29th and then look out for team magma's groudon from may third why i don't know why they weren't just the same day okay uh you'll be able to face off against archie and maxie in the extreme battle event ancient brawl between june 2nd so should be up as this podcast is up it is i looked at it i haven't done it yet because it requires more thought than i have in me that ends on june 29th uh these battles will be tough make sure your team is ready for the challenge i hope this like fills a void i'm feeling with masters right now uh complete the battles though and uh complete the battles though and you can earn both team aqua and team magma pins and unlock archie and coyote archie and kyogre and maxine groudon's level caps players who took part in the land and see wacon event should also be on the lookout for awards through the community challenge that's what we just talked about get your 6000 gems you have until june 13th to get that um reward and then players who took part in the event will also get their five-star power-ups gems etc etc uh the only right choice here is archie and kyogre correct i did i did pull on maxi and groudon i pulled on archie and kyogre a bunch did i get any of them no so i've tossed my phone into the lake and i am walking away i mean that's not what archie would want into the water back to the water with you which lake uh spring lake oh i'm not familiar with that one i would assume they would add like courtney and um courtney is the the man have you done have you done the event no is she in it yeah there well okay master spoiler they show up at the end so they come in so most likely they will they will be can't remember the admin for aqua i can't remember her name she was cool though too yeah so all of them show up uh i pulled and wasted all my gems on many many many many many many three stars i got stelix for is my five star for no re i'm like i don't want this i want your jasmine i mean i have it i don't need it cute for you i want my i want my archie in my corner i want my my big beefy sailor boy it's pride month for crying out loud and i didn't get it and i'm out of gems because i used my rewards to pull on it was very sad i'm very mad i need to keep logging in i'm low on gems too i'm out of gems i've used them all to not get archie um yeah so pokemon master's still doing it's it's its thing uh also for pokemon masters players they've added a new battle point reward system so if you play the game a bunch uh and do their little quests you'll get battle points and the battle points will allow you to summon special bp sync pairs uh so if you haven't picked up masters a bunch of the new events have been really fun the stories have been good but now there's also an extra reward for actually completing these events you get you move up in tears the more points you get the more access to the various special bp pairs you get so i we didn't talk about it it is the thing they added it's a little confusing but once you look at the daily rewards screen there's a new bp symbol a new bp coin uh once you collect enough the entire screen forces you to look at it and says you're at 200 points and this is your new reward um so it's a pretty cool way to actually add additional reason to replay or try for the higher level stuff is to get the bp points so you can get your unique sync pairs where what is two year august september we have we're getting close i think yeah we're getting close is it going to be like pokemon masters g gx are they are they keeping the eff giganta gigantomaxics well i would assume that that's like that has to be their two-year plan right like gigantomax has to be the two-year anniversary i i kind of hope that like i am partnered with dna i have no clue what they're doing for their two years sometimes they let me know when characters are coming early so yeah they could have i don't know they got megan's they got this sort of feels like the z moves and the sink pairs sort of fill that same slot yeah i would assume gigantomax does too yeah because because they already said leon's charizard's gigantic max like like right they said they're going to do it they didn't say how yeah they well okay i guess they said gigantomax is coming they didn't specifically say leon is leon is the only one in the game we know now nessa i didn't get b either i'm so mad at that game um i didn't even get a chance to pull on pull on nessa uh i want like the thing i i guess i would want overhauled is there are a lot of characters and masters now and they're all in like every banner so it's getting harder and harder to get what you want because it's like every five star is like point zero three percent poll rate and then because that all has to equal two percent or not yeah two percent not two percent um seven percent yeah uh so they need to like i don't know they i don't know how they fix that of like this is a water grass banner this is a fire steel banner i don't i don't know how other games deal with the gotcha problem when you have however many characters they have at this point i mean so i can tell you for like dragalia lost they will run um galas so they'll say this is a light gala and so they'll still pick certain light attuned heroes like five of them that have a higher chance uh and then everybody else remains the same like in masters they just did the hoenn banner so hoenn five stars are more likely to pull on oh that's cool i miss that um it just happened today or yesterday i should i should log into masters now that we're talking about get my gems here i do like how masters keeps changing their icon it's a little thing but i kind of yeah kind of into it uh groupon and kroger fighting it out so i imagined because they're again their banners are becoming a problem um they're kind they've always been messy and there's been too many of them but i like the trend of region specific like honing it into that um like like you kind of know what you're going to end up with and like whoa i didn't know they were 12 fair chance yeah they're much higher oh but they're one percent overall what is this little icon next to it what little icon when you click on like the so it says twelve percent for five stars and then it says archie's a one percent but it has like a little metal next to it oh this probably says right here which banner are you one are she's yeah so when you go down to offering right let me get over there fascinating audio content oh we'll fill the void i here's my pokemon masters update i still don't play or log in i i believe that is the featured master sync pair so if you look on the front page of it it's got the same oh i see scsc so that's the one in that banner like if you go click over to maxi it's the same but normally they're two percent yeah so they increased it from ten percent to twelve percent but they decreased it from two percent i don't know if i like that yeah i'm a little i'm a little miffed about it because all of my things have been bad hmm i only got 8 000 gems i have 400 because i didn't get i didn't get archie i'm so mad dna give me steve's gems jerks get that stipend i have not gotten my june stipend yet maybe well give it to me maybe i'll go go crazy uh okay let's switch gears a little bit this was sent in by chris in our slack community this is the good dirt which chris uh the chris g new jersey chris yeah well i didn't want to talk some will yes because there's no there's only there's only one we're going to ignore chris christie who chris in new jersey begged us to ignore he will forever be saddled with that is the chris of new jersey that everybody knows okay so [Laughter] number one uh pokemon cards are back at target uh that's part of the news that lasted a whole solid maybe three weeks i saw that i saw that i went into target today boots on the ground first-hand reporting i walked into a target and they had a plethora of pokemon cards they had nothing but booster packs but they had battle styles and they had vivid voltage and they had blister packs which are the three packs and they were limiting two cards per people per person um so uh there was like an aracudo promo i didn't have so i picked that up um and then i didn't see any sports cards although to be fair i don't think i've ever really specifically looked at what sports cards look like but i i don't think they're i don't think they brought back sports cards i could be wrong on that they come in foil packages and they're like just like these rectangular pieces of cardboard with ink on them sometimes it's okay reflective and hollow usually like a person in a baseball uniform i would assume yeah i mean if it's that kind of a sport sure but there's other sports out there there's there's a there's the there's the one that you play with your feet okay that's very popular in europe europe european feet let's put it this way it's very popular in all of the world that's not the united states of america uh word ball number two is the one that chris sent in and this is from ebay and they are updating their policy regarding cards i'm just going to read it it's relatively short i didn't i i normally kind of so this is just a screenshot of the rules or the the changes i like google search this and no one is really reporting on this um there was like i don't know like one article that kind of mentioned it but they didn't even like mention the changes which is like ebay's doing something about pokemon cards and then like didn't mention okay but this is what it is they say we are updating our bid retraction policy for sports trading cards non-sports trading cards and collectible card game auctions starting june 30th 2021 buyers will no longer have the ability to retract bids on trading card auctions without sellers approval sellers decisions to accept or reject the auction bid retraction requests will be final how the new auction bid retraction policy will work starting on june 30th if you want to retract your auction bid you must contact the seller via messaging on ebay boy that that that's not good and it's like still the same thing from like 2007 to request a retraction the seller at their sole discretion will be able to accept or decline your retraction request if the seller does not accept your request you can bid your bid can still win or lose the auction and you will still be required to make a payment on any winning bid you submit we also inform buyers for our bid retraction policy page that a bid is a binding contract as previously communica kinda as previously communicated as april 2021 if the item goes unpaid by the fifth calendar day the seller may cancel the uh order due to non-payment regularly missed payments may impact your account check out our unpaid item policy to learn more okay so yeah theoretically if you bid on something on ebay you you have to pay but also the worst thing that happens is they just suspend your account that's it like it's not like they take you to like court they take it yeah ebay courts come into fox but this is a like like there is a thing on ebay where people will like for like ps5s or or things that are obviously scalped people will make brand new accounts they'll get the bid up really high and then they don't pay and it doesn't matter because they made this fresh account and then the seller now wasted a week and they have to relist it the seller can get around that by saying like your account must be verified through a phone number or your account must be like 60 days old or your account must have at least like 10 bids so there's like ways around it uh but you could you can still get away with it with like relatively new scalpers or scalpers that are not like super tech savvy um so are you saying that this policy change is to protect the scalpers no i i but also yes but no but yes but likely this is how we speak in the midwest if it ends on the negative then it actually means no if it ends on the positive then it means no but if there's three in there then it means yes yes yes no yes there you go i don't like this is a personal thing i don't like that rule in general on ebay of like retracting your bid you've made the bid yeah but then i like just lost my job yeah and i was like i can't yeah now i can't fulfill my wallet i can't pay i i was i was on ambien and i thought it looked good and in the morning when i woke up i realized i had been on here all night i know a podcaster who literally has told the tale of how they had like a wish list on ebay of things that they would like dream of buying but never would actually pull the trigger and buy and they were literally on ambien and went ahead and just bought the entire wish list and didn't even realize it until the things started showing up at their door oh get wrecked basically i worked for a guy who listed he he was uh an owner of a startup so he had a lot of flowing cash and he was very spendy he would buy a bunch of things and then like two to three weeks later after buying said things he would be very bored of said things uh so he would list them on ebay and he would go around the office asking people if they had ebay accounts if they could bid on his thing to drive up the price wow who's the real scammer that's scammy which is against also against ebay's terms of service no better it was me i was the one that owned a startup company i'm yeah i'm i guess i would love to dive deeper into like what because obviously something is happening here with scalpers and selling cards as quickly as possible on ebay to get their money but also people use where are those what is that other like that iphone app not not facebook marketplace meetup no not meetup there's like a couple apps that are like sell it i think sell it is one anyways i'm sure people use that as well there's like a there's like a there's a app that is for selling shoes and i can't remember its name um yeah but they like sell nikes because nikes are like really scalped and stuff uh and then pokemon cards started appearing on that app as well we legit have a few sneaker freaks who listen to this program they can probably are preparing the tweets right now to let us know yeah i like literally i just love it i go on instagram and like see a pair of let me not use not appropriate language for this program but ugly you insert the word shoes and they're like i only wear them once two thousand dollars yeah so as of this recording as well circling back to the pokemon card stuff pokemon center listed uh the sword and shield chilling rain pokemon center elite trainer box which is weird i didn't notice this till bobby pointed it out so two things number one still in stock it's been in stock for eight hours this is the etb uh the other weird thing is that this is 50 which is not the normal price of an etb normally etbs are 40 and they come with eight packs and then there's there's the special etbs like dragons exalted or shining fates or hidden legends that are 50 and they come with 10 booster packs but that's because they're special and you can't buy booster packs single for those like the ones i just named they never sold singles you can only get them in blisters or whatnot so this on pokemon center which is still in stock is 50 and it's coming with 10 booster packs and it's coming um but like if you go to like best buy or target and you want the same chilling rain booster pack it's forty dollars for eight so it's not the same is it right so i guess pokemon like also they say purchase limit of 10. why are you just what why are you why they know this isn't why are they letting people buy 10 etbs well they're not so but they're still not out of stock so maybe this is a sign and i i said this months ago that we're going to start seeing with battle styles that people are going to get not interested because battle styles doesn't have charizard does that pikachu no one knows who an urshifu is and in chilling reigns there is articuno which i guess people know but people don't really care about them as much as they care about yeah i mean nobody cares as much as charizard right also is it the original uh it's not it's the gallerian one it's the nobody cares about those ugly fire chickens and do you know how badly people don't care about those ugly fire chickens i still haven't caught them in the game there you go that's how bad they are i am not saying that crown not crown thunder chilling reigns is gonna like solve all the problems and you'll be able to walk in but hey it's been this is this right here is 10 hours you can go to pokemoncenter.com you get the etb for the exact price it has did not sell out the battle styles etb sold out in less than 10 minutes the vivid uh what was that what was before that shining the one with each of shining faiths i don't they're all blending together now that sold out in 10 minutes it's been 10 hours i'm sure when the podcast goes up maybe i'll probably be sold out but uh this is a good sign that either i don't think their like robot check has gotten better definitely asked me multiple times when i was checking out if i was a robot i'm not i just wanted one of each etb uh so we'll see we'll see going into the summer we talked about this also before that like now that people are vaccinated people are traveling people are going to events they're spending their money elsewhere maybe they already got chonky pikachu they don't need another chunky pikachu in their life maybe they gave up on charizard they're moving their money elsewhere so uh hopefully the the card stuff has gotten better target apparently was like hey three weeks was long enough we solved the world issues cards are back well are they they're still not selling sports cards yeah which which you clarified was the true issue which is the true issue barnes and noble i went in the two days ago barnes and noble barnes and noble always coming through though they had like six shiny where is there a barnes and noble no he said you and your barnes oh because i was like i could tell you where there is there's a barnes noble there's a mall of america one there's a roseville one i know my barnes and noble hey they're always coming through with pokemon cards all right uh let's take a break we got some pokemon go news we got some more merchandise news and we will be right back [Music] [Applause] [Music] and we are back from our break this is not really pokemon related news but we'll probably end up being pokemon related news nintendo announced their all virtual e3 this is off nintendo.com mark your calendars june 15th nintendo will host its e3 2021 live stream tune in at 9am pacific time for a nintendo direct featuring roughly 40 minutes of information focused exclusively on nintendo switch games really mainly releasing in 2021 immediately after the direct continue watching for three hours of deep dives on game play of the handful of nintendo switch games in nintendo treehouse live it's back the treehouse is back donkey kong is ready it doesn't say that on the website but it sounds like it because i'm still talking in this voice while this year's e3 has gone virtual everyone is invited to tune in to nintendo's digital activities on june 15th and i will be streaming their stream on twitch so if you want my bad takes live wait number one your voice was pokemon coliseum is what that was yeah number two did they retire the tree house of terror is that no longer a thing no they still did the treehouse okay remember the tree houses where they told everyone the national decks was getting cut i remember i remember last week with a thick haze so no do we think 40 minutes is for so they said 40 minutes of exclusively games software exclusively games coming out mainly for 2021 that sounds like pokemon makes that cut what else they got to fill it's 30 minutes of breath of the wild two no five minutes of switch oh wait you said not hardware switching specifically said software will be the software features of the switch pro i think so which includes some sort of me maker and background man playing on my 3ds and having those rotating backgrounds and the beautiful espeon background why can't i have that on my switch that's all black or white maybe while the c you see the switch is referencing the upcoming black and white three that's why you can't have other black and white remakes is where we're at uh there were the rumors is they're going to show off the switch pro before e3 so that when they're showing software they can then talk about why it would run better on the switch pro that's the rumor at least because it has 4ks four not just komala 1000 ps uh i can't even think of three other k pokemon kangaskhan kangaskhan and uh mega kangaskhan the 4ks the 4ks they have to show diamond pearl right yeah they like i like absolutely show so last time in treehouse they like they i think they showed like the same trailer of sword and shield but then in the tree house they were playing sword and shield they were like in the wild area right because i remember you saw a bunch of wingles i remember this very clear you saw a bunch of wingles like flying around because people got mad that the like wiggle didn't fly properly even though it did uh and then she was like and then they still have random encounters in the grass and she like snuck up and then went to the grass and then another window popped up yeah i remember that so that was on treehouse yeah i'm pretty sure that was on treehouse that was definitely on treehouse um i don't know i don't if they're saying games releasing 2021 is breath of wild 2 coming out this year i didn't think so i didn't know no idea that's just the only thing that people actually want yeah i mean that's that's probably the most anticipated is you know what i want give me a new mario kart give me those were the days man those were the days you have a mario kart already that's a remake that's a really good it's an e-makeup email i see it's a it's an e-make of a wii u game not only is mario kart 8 deluxe the best-selling switch game to date but it's just a wii u game that they kind of just spiced up which is like mario kart 8 was very good i liked it a lot it was the best wii u game for sure we played a lot but it's it's even better selling than breath of the wild and oh yeah smash bros yes mario kart's always a top contender i need a mario kart 9. with pokemon they did make that vr mario kart is that yeah the one with the rc car no it didn't satisfy what you know how they put like isabelle and lincoln mario kart why can't pikachu be one because pikachus know how to drive pikachu would short out the engine not with that attitude yeah basically that attitude pikachu was uh a rock star he was a he was a luchador he was a mad scientist pikachu gets around they've had plenty of money anything that pikachu wishes don't stifle pikachu's dreams look i'm tired of pikachu dominating the conversation it's time for charizard to take over and drive a car i don't think we get anything other poke like i don't think we get like a detective pikachu or like a sleep i feel like they still save that for something else but i feel like the diamond pro fits here i think i'm going to profit too yeah this is off pokemon go live the season of discovery june 1st during the season of legends therian forms of tornados thunderous and landorus arrived in pokemon go setting the stage for the pokemon go debuts of xerneas and evatol trainers became legendary and legends were told and made now i don't remember become legendary at all well i remember spending money that's on you you became legendary now we celebrate the next season the season of discovery which will feature our fifth anniversary of celebrations of pokemon go fest 2021 from encountering pokemon that have never appeared in pokemon go to discovering new ones that we've grown to about from encountering pokemon that have never been uh appeared in pokemon go before to discovering new things about the ones we've grown to know and love this season is about the spirit of discovery in pokemon go the season of discovery will run from june 1st to september 1st and some of the things that will happen is they will kick off with reggie rock regis and reggie steele returning to five star raids they will appear from june 1st to june 17th after that surprise pokemon will appear in five star raids keep your eyes peeled uh unexpected guests will all also make appearance to five star raids uh including exciting encounters during go fest 2021 look out for more details this season mega raids will feature only one mega of pokemon evolve of the season mega raids will feature only one mega evolved pokemon at times stay tuned for details each month to for see what's coming here's the blog there uh okay so that was all the raid stuff so reggie rock red red ice and reggie steele each have their own week and then there's a question mark week after it so like the week of june 2nd this week is reggie rock um then next week june 9th is reggie steele and then june 16th is regis and then they say june 23rd to be announced and june 30th to be announced am i dumb that's rhetorical and thinking that it's not just reggie elike and reggie drago um i think that's a reasonable consideration since they're saying this is discovery and those are two new pokemons does this mean i can finally finish the reggie event from however long ago that was yes yes i paid for what do you need for it do you need to catch a reggie rock oh that's like only knows uh it's like catch 30 some things and the problem where i always get hung up it's like give your buddy three treats i'm like ah buddy ain't earned three treats yet but buddy's gotta do some work here we go uh not a drive to investigate now a spooky message unmasked uh uh number 151 that's a long way off season of legends oh take a snapshot of landorus that would be fun uh a thousand year slumber is that it yeah cause that gets you reggie giggs at the end battle a team leader three times well we're never finishing this one win against a number another trainer seven times greg next time we get together let me beat you seven times okay okay that's that that's or wait no no no no no bringing that kind of friendship a colossal discovery yeah seven snapshots of rock type pokemon no take seven snapshots of ice type pokemon no easy take seven snaps i'm not taking no snapshots of no pokemon no they like it though look film isn't free and neither is the kodak processing i'm not gonna spend money good lord distracted by something shiny it's still what take a snapshot of gret that's not happening give your body 10 tree techno a troubling situation pure this is the one that kills me purify or fire water or grass type shadow pokemon they haven't had a fire water or grass type shot of pokemon in four years they have a guarantee they have not not in my version of pokemon go maybe in yours i feel like all these complaints are i just don't want to play this game i don't want to play it the way that the man wants to force me to play i want to play it my way sending gifts and giving gifts if it is reggie if it is reggie ella key and reggie drago oh does that mean then i gotta take seven photos of electric pokemons and seven photos of dragon pokemons i i find those two to be very exciting because there's only one way to get them through the dlc and you can only get them once and you can only pick one of the two so being able to maybe get an extra two or three through raids that you can transfer through pokemon home because you're paying 16 a year for that uh feels exciting to me it doesn't i mean i feel like it's obvious but maybe it's not obvious that it would be those two because if it was like reggie rock reggie still regis and then reggie giggis it just why would i don't know maybe i'm overthinking it uh in addition to mega raids mega low punny will be available from june 1st to june 8th mega slobro making its pokemon go debut from uh june 8th through june 17th and mega gyarados returning to raids from june 17th to july 2nd and then from june 1st on only one pokemon will be appearing in mega raids at a time i think that's fine um is this also the first appearance of galerion slowpoke yes in pokemon go yeah that was all the raid stuff that we got through and then from tuesday uh so trainers some sometimes the best adventures is a slow one i think they were talking to you will that i've already arrived here and

20 pokeballs 10 great balls and a king's rock um and going back to our merchandise conversation earlier they added a 450 life-size slowpoke to pokemon center for pre-order in both the japanese pokemon center and the english pokemon center so there is a lot of i don't know if we talk about this a lot in the show but i feel like there has been a lot of really good synergy in the last year with pokemon center pokemon go pokemon masters the anime not so much sword and shield sometimes sword and shield but at least those products have been really good at keeping things in what what's the word uh the word is just synergy i don't know harmony item harmony yeah they're all working together it was like when ash in the journeys anime got an egg oh this is maybe a spoiler look that episode came out a year ago you had time to watch it the egg hatches into a rio lou and in go that same week they boosted riolu in eggs um and there was some pokemon snap synergy with the raid bosses and some things that happened at the end of snap that was kind of cool so i feel like they've done a really good job of that recently um versus i know people always kind of like there was that there was that like uh pokemon direct where ishihara was talking and there was like an espionage umbreon behind him and then there was like the special edition let's go pikachu switch behind him and people like put two and two to get like oh that means less so go johto is coming like people do look for that kind of stuff but they they miss like the obvious stuff of like oh it's slowpoke week and pokemon go and pokemon center just put a 400 feet like that is that is like the thing that like that is what they are doing like they're not being subtle they're being very obvious about it i have a slobor related question okay i am the slowpoke master i have caught six in let's go and i defeated the other slow pokemaster for titles so yeah if you mega evolve gallerian slow bro what does does it just turn into regular mega what why not because it's it you can't make it because it's a gallerian it doesn't know how to mega but i guess it's a manga is infested by i gave it the mega stone to hold and according to genetics it's just a slow bro just like any other slow bro no according to the pokedex modified by the berries it was according to the pokedex it doesn't get a new pokedex number therefore according to science and the periodic table of the pokedex developments it should evolve into you can something you can giganta max a regular mouth but you cannot gigantomax meow meow meow a i am a a whole lot cause it's real it's real dumb looking it's nice i was at pokemon worlds when they revealed that thing and everybody was like this is the mega that we're getting seriously yeah they know what they're doing i was in the room where it happened the disappointment happened uh there is also a solstice event coming from uh june 17th through june 20th trainers in the northern hemisphere will encounter summer pokemon while trainers in the southern hem the southern hemisphere will do winter pokemon and there's question mark question mark question mark which i think that means uh johto remakes because that was the rival question mark question mark question mark true correct uh trainers will be able to sync their i don't like reading this trainers will be able to sink their two front teeth into an unexpected event from friday june 25th from 10 a.m to thursday july 1st 8 p.m sink their teeth what was that like christmas well they said two front teeth so it's like all i want for chris is my two front teeth yep there's a song no he's already in the game do people use their two front teeth to eat an apple you use all of your teeth kids don't eat apples trainers will be able to sink their two front teeth into an unexpected event i mean it's isn't it referring to slowpoke because slowpoke has two front teeth that are sticking out no because the slow poke event is over on um sunday june 13th is it like not a food based pokemon though right sink your teeth into food i mean it's i think it's teeth the teeth is the part maybe it's the tooth pokemon the uh which which which is this which press release is this where are you seeing this um june events get a free raid pass from breakthrough and more it's at the bottom it's bidoof uh you're probably right yep it is probably be doof now that you've said that yep it's teeth it's the doofer two front teeth yep from friday that's a that's a weekend yeah i could see them doing a weekend long event for bedou they people really like beedeef hmm megabitdoof if it is though i feel like b doof would have been a good candidate for community no because it only has two evolutions and that everybody knows we don't like community days that only have like that only evolve once right they've had a sandshrew they nominated sand true at one point and then and vulpix and people said i don't know what one weedle or something charmander one again yeah because it's got two evolutions magikarp was a community will come on and people were very unhappy because we already all had blue it was a community that was just two and nobody complained about suabloo community day oh people did everybody complains about everything uh yeah you're probably right it's probably b doof now that you've said that it's the doofer it's peanut butter dufourino uh well we already talked about the giant slowpoke uh so i guess it's time now to talk about the pokey plush that captures joltik eating yamper's butt but it's is a is the booty eating gel tick this is operations now this is inappropriate content i want this so much this is off polygon the pokemon company toy maker tomy are finally capturing the purest essence of the pokemon joltek and yamper and toy form the new plush combines the two in a very particular way joltik is i'm going to change some words here uh joltik is feasting on yamper's butt uh the new plush will cost you six thousand yen uh it is more than a static stuffed animal it vibrates yep this pole toy you if you yoink on the joltik end of the tomy plush and the uh the attaching pokemon will scurry right up to yamper's booty uh where it will suck the electricity out of the puppy pokemon this of course is canon in the world of pokemon as noted in joltik's pokedex entry and pokemon shield joltik josek latch on to other pokemon and suck out the electricity they are often found sticking to yamper's hindquarters and quote previous pokedex entries for joltik are less graphic simply noting that the electric bug type pokemon sticks onto large bodies of pokemon and absorbs the static electricity storing it later in its pouch and if you go to the tomy site you can see the animation of joltik scooting up on yamper and clomping on them buns this would do very well in the world of tickle me elmo my browser felt the need to place a warning that the video of the uh joltik toy writes it could possibly be sensitive or inappropriate content i mean there is something sensitive or violent content tap to display it's so good i want this thing so bad first of all i love both those pokemon and second of all the animation of it scooting across and then scooping up yampers little buns it's the greatest it's the whoever can get me one just get me one i don't just send it to me in the mail i'll be surprised it will show up at my house like oh a gift from heaven it does look pretty cute it is so cute it is so funny i was gonna thank the person who sent that into slack but that was just you greg you just you were the one that posted thank me thanks greg for sending in the yamper booty uh tonering sent in the giants by the way it's it's insufficiently harp shaped booty on that yamper i mean throw it out redo it i don't want it until it's done properly it's pretty good like i'm looking at the multiple pictures of it all right question of the week oh yeah a lot of you are ready we're here look we had a solid 30 minutes of different news it was we we went through it we fit everything in we got some sword and shields masters some go some tcg we even talked about the anime no one could possibly be upset with what we covered oh no no no one no one could all right here we go ready i wanna know the question of the week is that part of the show [Music] it is diana ross i'm coming out for pride you are the worst i'm revoking all of your badges i'm taking away your passes to our secret clubs yes done whitney who says i want to dance with somebody among other massive hits wait what was the whitney houston that i used to listen to in the gay clubs back in the 90s good gracious there were so many it was like at that time when madonna's album came out and it was like madonna and whitney up there on the screen yeah scream [Laughter] all right go question of the week get it why am i the bad ally good question steve oh boy uh let's get started from basic let's let's let's go with kevin for now i'm gonna also pull a question from youtube as well because i want to start pulling from youtube so you know because people people like to comment on youtube so give them you got to ask for the comment on youtube right you got to say like hey make sure you like make sure you hit subscribe it's been proven that bring the likes that it increases it by like 70 people are more likely to do it if you like guilt them into like hey you're you're like an hour into this episode on youtube did you hit the like button yet well i mean we have to thank the commenters on youtube because they're the only ones who realize that my accent is completely fake and made up and i just do it for attention yes also this is how i work when somebody says hey you should like this i'm like heck i will [Laughter] you should not you under the reverse cycle you should not like this video right now um so yeah we're gonna start taking one question from our youtube comments as well so if you're watching on youtube feel free to ask a question for next week and we'll do two uh but this one's far from our slack from kevin what's a non-video game business you want to see pokemon work with tesla no um what what is a non-video game business that pokemon doesn't or yeah i mean i've tried to go like fracking i want pokemon to work with frank i like how that was your first one well [ __ ] about fracking they are very good at being everywhere yes um i don't think there's like a pokemon bicycle will oh yeah yeah there is it's called the rotom bike it's in sword and shield yeah but what made it a real one what if surly made a rotom bike okay number one surly is above okay they are not they are not above that pokemon money i have a legit answer seriously legit answer okay i went to mitsuwa like two weeks ago it's a japanese marketplace um and they had hello kitty wine and they had three different types and they had little tags over them saying like this is not intended for children but it was like hello kitty like sparkling whatever and then hello kitty like red velvet sparkling and then like they had three like it was like a 40 or a 50 a dollar in like a 65 dollar bottle let's be honest and pokemon could do this no and get away with it fine apple yeah fellow kitty can do it they pikachu do it because in 2021 hello kitty is no longer none of hello kitty is for children she's a friend have you seen agret saku or whatever the death metal listening red panda have you seen gudetama the depressed egg yes yeah because they have like a netflix show right yeah yes yeah i didn't know that was hello kitty that is it hello kitty is no longer for children i mean there are aspects for children and their aspects for adults okay my realist answer is i still want an actual rpg company to work with pokemon to make an actual rpg i've got the real answer fracking no that was the joke answer the real answer is pet toys oh that was a good one or pet supplies like i i want a pokemon leash for my doggie i want like i want like a little wishy-washy that my cat can throw around exactly yeah that is a good one i signed up i signed up on that i signed up on catnip done sparse i think they can get away with wine i i'm not on board we already have a pokemon cafe if they wanted to do wine there'd be wine in the pokemon you've been to the pokemon cafe did you not get crunk my wallet was was very sad after that experience it was a very round things in my room to see what else i would want uh pokemon butter dish why steve why didn't you stress that harder i blame you we really dropped the ball we dropped that ball and then like bts came out with the butter sauce pokemon like headphones and like a mouse and computer keyboard yes about all that all of that uh this question is from our youtube this is from chloe uh they said which uh what legendary pokemons in crown punt crown tundra did you pick because there's a lot so i believe they're asking did you pick last year spectre did you pick eleki or drago uh i haven't picked my reggie yet i went with ice horse because i like ice types i went with ghost horse and that's also as far as i've gotten so far oh man i went with eyesores too because i sourced best heard yeah but you picked one first right so there was a reason i will say of the regis i'm leaning towards the dragon one draco heck yeah dragons come first dragon's coming there's too many i don't remember what everyone thought eliquid was a bad name reggie no it's good it really grew it really great i just like finland is so like it's like so it's like are you one or the other yeah are you are you communists or are you scandinavians what do you pick let's pick a side folks are are you like hungarians was there another choice no that was it there's probably another choice because you can get all the birds yeah you can get all the birds you can get all the things in the in the adventures i think those were the two main choices yeah uh urshifu or shifu did you do the what did you do rapid or uh water dang i don't even remember and i would play shield so i got the shield dog i went with uh well yeah you don't get a choice there you're kind of like yeah take take your dog and move on i mean i have sword but i played shield first that was my choice made for me there i went with rapid strike the water one yeah i did water which is the one that's like on the more east side of the not not the one that's out on an island the one near the water is the water one the one on top of the mountain is the the dark in fighting that's me that's what i got uh well thanks for the questions uh and then we will do pokemon of the week it was short it was short i'll read it again and maybe this is the week that steve gets it and greg doesn't get it because i know steve knows this oh my hair hair's out of control we'll skip number one because it literally had nothing to do with the actual pokemon of the week number two this week's pokemon has two forms one of which features either a wigglytuff or jigglypuff doll with its stuffing exposed number three another popular card introduced in 2012 this pokemon could potentially stop key components of opponent's decks from functioning but had to be used very carefully i the only other thing i could say is what what pokemon as part of the pokemon itself would feature something that somebody may say have thrown away i think i know when you said it stops other pokemon cards i i there's only two answers all right well who's that pokemon is it has a little like jigglypuff or wigglytuff doll stuck to it with the stuffing sticking out garbodor and vileplum have the same normally the same ability which is like shutting down supporters or shutting down abilities well i mean garbodor had garbo toxin specifically so if you had when did garbo get into the games some say your heart always knows what's right that's why the card was introduced in 2012 but yes if you had a tool card attached to garboda it shut down all abilities of all pokemon cards except for garbotoxin so you had to be careful because if you needed the ability of your one of your pokemons to go off you needed a tool i pronounce it scraper most people pronounce it scrapper to remove the tool from your garbodor oh so then you're on your turn you could have abilities and then return a tool to your garbodor so that your opponent could not have abilities the old tool scraper or scrapper garbodor shares similar traits to muck and wheezing all three are pure poison type pokemon with a single pre-evolved form roughly the same base stat totals and evolutions and appear to be based on different types of pollution garb order being land pollution and garb orders the only gen 5 pokemon to have a gigantomax form they're only one and gen 5 g's yeah whoever picks and chooses these things i need to talk honestly they need to include us in their meetings so that we can contribute some actual meaningful information so we can just go no bad james turner call us hmm true do we have i like our motor do we have any uh opinions on shinies shuffles shiny's good shiny is very good the is there oh i'm very torn on the shuffle icon i'm leaning more towards i really like it except it does look like he's just screaming into the air like somebody just stepped on his toe he's a vibe right there very vibey um well if uh if you made it to the end oh sorry we'll give us i have to get that they need a new pokemon to i'm sorry to complain about outside control this week i'm just distracted by this never-ending loop of a gif of a joltek sneaky [Music] yamper here all right this one is a gimme for greg because obviously he had so much trouble this past week so it's gonna be real easy for him i was recently in philadelphia with acclaimed podcast host and author greg leatherman on the occasion of his birth anniversary as we were passing the hours in the asian-themed section of the city of brotherly love we happened upon a store named asia crafts this store featured many pokemon and sanrio licensed properties of which i purchased two as gifts to honor greg's special day i also bought him dinner and dessert later that yeah one of the gifts was an alolan vulpix which he had previously held fondly as we browsed the market the other gift was a pin featuring greg's favorite and my second favorite sanrio character this week's pokemon is derived from that character you can figure it out if you rearrange the letters properly you may have to remove the c and the d though and by c i mean like on the moon or around italy that's all you get i i can't make it any easier for you guys that is so easy okay so if any news comes out on friday or saturday uh we recorded this on thursday night we recorded it early so because i'll be playing gimbal community with greg and will on sunday oh wow that have to be gibbel oh they're always picking the worst pokemon for community today
