jumping and i'm like i'm used to the (0:41 - 0:45)
papa (0:43 - 0:48)
whistle (0:45 - 0:52)
suddenly we're just in the episode (0:48 - 0:52)
good grief it was just go go go go go go (0:52 - 0:56)
go (0:55 - 1:00)
spj with me is greg hello i am your host (0:56 - 1:02)
greg with me as spj (1:00 - 1:03)
uh take that (1:02 - 1:07)
wow wow will is here so what's more (1:03 - 1:09)
important the fact that i got a sick (1:07 - 1:12)
pump at the gym this morning because i (1:09 - 1:15)
did a total bro workout yeah (1:12 - 1:17)
yeah or i it was literally just chest (1:15 - 1:19)
and arms it is like the most bro workout (1:17 - 1:20)
possible (1:19 - 1:21)
or (1:20 - 1:24)
the end of gardenscapes (1:21 - 1:25)
what (1:24 - 1:27)
i (1:25 - 1:29)
i didn't delete it but i have gotten to (1:27 - 1:30)
a level (1:29 - 1:33)
that i will never be able to get past (1:30 - 1:35)
and therefore (1:33 - 1:37)
i've installed solitaire (1:35 - 1:38)
and actually find solitaire to be that (1:37 - 1:42)
much more fun (1:38 - 1:42)
what a twist (1:42 - 1:47)
oh and you won't join me on my game (1:45 - 1:49)
though (1:47 - 1:52)
what oh no no no no because that is so (1:49 - 1:54)
much false advertising (1:52 - 1:55)
with (1:54 - 1:57)
there's so much fun (1:55 - 2:00)
gardenscapes too they actually put in (1:57 - 2:02)
those things from their ads because they (2:00 - 2:04)
got so many complaints about the false (2:02 - 2:06)
advertising project makeover i ain't not (2:04 - 2:08)
shaving anybody's head or applying it (2:06 - 2:10)
yeah yeah (2:08 - 2:11)
yeah yeah you don't even you just pick (2:10 - 2:13)
the colors they do (2:11 - 2:14)
it's super easy to get interested in (2:13 - 2:17)
other actual human beings lives to care (2:14 - 2:19)
about their well-being let alone virtual (2:17 - 2:22)
humans who can't make decisions about (2:19 - 2:24)
what clothes to wear (2:22 - 2:24)
so (2:25 - 2:28)
that animal crossing update then (2:26 - 2:30)
uh okay (2:28 - 2:33)
let's uh we'll have some pokemon news uh (2:30 - 2:34)
i (2:33 - 2:37)
well moving in less than two weeks so (2:34 - 2:38)
the (2:37 - 2:40)
sense of urgency for me might be high uh (2:38 - 2:42)
but i just want to make sure we have (2:40 - 2:44)
some good shows and if they're not 40 (2:42 - 2:47)
hours long like they normally are that's (2:44 - 2:48)
probably why (2:47 - 2:50)
also there's no news nothing is (2:48 - 2:51)
happening (2:50 - 2:53)
uh (2:51 - 2:55)
uh i can always find something i'm (2:53 - 2:55)
pretty good (2:55 - 2:57)
you can always find something that (2:55 - 2:58)
doesn't mean it's worth talking about (2:57 - 3:01)
we'll still talk about it (2:58 - 3:02)
let's let's start with pokemon go stuff (3:01 - 3:05)
first uh i do want to start off (3:02 - 3:08)
with the twitch rivals (3:05 - 3:09)
uh because i thought that was kind of (3:08 - 3:11)
cool (3:09 - 3:13)
so two things uh one i stream on twitch (3:11 - 3:17)
twitch tv slash pk mencap (3:13 - 3:18)
and two (3:17 - 3:21)
there is something called twitch rivals (3:18 - 3:23)
which is like a competitive thing that (3:21 - 3:24)
twitch puts together and then that goes (3:23 - 3:26)
on like the front page of twitch (3:24 - 3:28)
um it's like they're big esports things (3:26 - 3:30)
and normally twitch rivals is like apex (3:28 - 3:33)
legends or call of duty or (3:30 - 3:34)
valorent (3:33 - 3:36)
uh all the stuff you would expect to be (3:34 - 3:38)
competitive and they would pick (3:36 - 3:42)
um usually pros but also like (3:38 - 3:43)
bigger streamers and the ideal is like (3:42 - 3:45)
obviously the bigger bigger streamers (3:43 - 3:46)
bring in the more casual competitive (3:45 - 3:48)
people the pros (3:46 - 3:50)
it's supposed to like you know (3:48 - 3:51)
bump up it's like what worlds does for (3:50 - 3:53)
pokemon you know gets people excited for (3:51 - 3:54)
competitive (3:53 - 3:56)
and niantic and the pokemon company (3:54 - 3:59)
partnered with twitch and they did the (3:56 - 4:01)
first ever twitch rivals pokemon go (3:59 - 4:04)
thing which is highly ironic that greg (4:01 - 4:06)
and i complained about uh (4:04 - 4:09)
the pokemon go competitive thing uh (4:06 - 4:12)
he wouldn't say complained i would say (4:09 - 4:15)
poked fun app but you know what the only (4:12 - 4:16)
thing i could think of when i was (4:15 - 4:18)
listening to that whole conversation was (4:16 - 4:20)
greg has never been to a worlds (4:18 - 4:22)
nope that's true so he doesn't get the (4:20 - 4:24)
concept of sitting in the audience and (4:22 - 4:26)
watching people play a video game (4:24 - 4:29)
because you act like a headline about i (4:26 - 4:31)
have never sat in an audience watching (4:29 - 4:32)
people play video games before i just (4:31 - 4:34)
have never done it for pokemon yeah for (4:32 - 4:37)
a lot of things there's there's not a (4:34 - 4:37)
far (4:37 - 4:39)
distance between watching somebody play (4:37 - 4:41)
competitive pokemon go and watching (4:39 - 4:43)
somebody play competitive (4:41 - 4:44)
vgc (4:43 - 4:46)
pokemon just because there's battle (4:44 - 4:49)
animations doesn't make it (4:46 - 4:51)
watching the two people sit across from (4:49 - 4:53)
each other at a table with their screens (4:51 - 4:56)
projected on the large screen any better (4:53 - 4:58)
yeah but that's not new pokemon go part (4:56 - 4:59)
was new (4:58 - 5:02)
it's right for conversation right (4:59 - 5:04)
conversation twitch rivals twitch rivals (5:02 - 5:08)
so they they they broke it into (5:04 - 5:10)
um three parts which i think is cool and (5:08 - 5:13)
i think that's you know i said last week (5:10 - 5:16)
that i i felt like pokemon go battling (5:13 - 5:19)
is is kind of a coin flip and (5:16 - 5:22)
that even if (5:19 - 5:22)
even if the leg which is the biggest (5:22 - 5:26)
problem with pokemon go was fixed it's (5:24 - 5:28)
still like kind of missing something uh (5:26 - 5:30)
and i don't know what that is but i can (5:28 - 5:32)
say at least when the twitch rivals they (5:30 - 5:34)
broke it into three parts they broke it (5:32 - 5:36)
into (5:34 - 5:39)
so so niantic or i should probably say (5:36 - 5:41)
twitch so twitch sent (5:39 - 5:43)
all 15 (5:41 - 5:45)
16 18 people (5:43 - 5:47)
i was part of this by the way (5:45 - 5:49)
so they picked me they picked some other (5:47 - 5:50)
people in the pokemon go community and (5:49 - 5:53)
then they picked um (5:50 - 5:57)
they picked uh six irl streamers so it (5:53 - 5:59)
was kind of a cool concept they had six (5:57 - 6:02)
like pros i was not a pro that's okay i (5:59 - 6:04)
would never consider myself a pro in (6:02 - 6:05)
pokemon go battling please don't let me (6:04 - 6:07)
get there (6:05 - 6:11)
so they picked six pros they picked six (6:07 - 6:13)
whatever like (6:11 - 6:15)
pro high profile streamers i guess i was (6:13 - 6:18)
one of them and then they picked six irl (6:15 - 6:19)
streamers and the whole point was the (6:18 - 6:21)
iron streamers were going to go outside (6:19 - 6:24)
for an hour and catch pokemon the my (6:21 - 6:26)
people were going to sit at home and (6:24 - 6:28)
catch pokemon the coaches were going to (6:26 - 6:30)
sit at home and catch pokemon but then (6:28 - 6:31)
the coaches also had the added (6:30 - 6:33)
responsibility of like making sure (6:31 - 6:35)
their other two people the irl and then (6:33 - 6:37)
my people (6:35 - 6:38)
um (6:37 - 6:39)
would be able to build a competitive (6:38 - 6:40)
team (6:39 - 6:42)
and so that that first session was like (6:40 - 6:45)
an hour and on paper ideally good but (6:42 - 6:48)
also like irl gear is very hard to (6:45 - 6:49)
manage and get set up and they were out (6:48 - 6:51)
and about and then they had to get back (6:49 - 6:53)
and so that was a little messy but (6:51 - 6:54)
um (6:53 - 6:56)
the first hour (6:54 - 6:58)
niantic or sorry twitch sent us these (6:56 - 7:00)
phones these phones had special accounts (6:58 - 7:02)
on them all ready to go they had 300 (7:00 - 7:03)
pokeballs no berries they had like (7:02 - 7:08)
incense they had um like 1500 rare candy (7:03 - 7:11)
they had uh like elite tms and stuff so (7:08 - 7:12)
they were they were ready to go (7:11 - 7:14)
specifically for this tournament and (7:12 - 7:17)
then they gave us special spawns and (7:14 - 7:19)
they were like these like 25 pokemon (7:17 - 7:21)
will be spawning in an hour you can (7:19 - 7:23)
catch them and then those are the (7:21 - 7:24)
pokemon you'll be able to use for battle (7:23 - 7:26)
so that was actually really cool so we (7:24 - 7:27)
we i (7:26 - 7:29)
set my office chair right here i caught (7:27 - 7:31)
pokemon for an hour (7:29 - 7:33)
before we went into it my coach was like (7:31 - 7:35)
okay these are the teams i thought of (7:33 - 7:36)
who wants what team and i was like oh i (7:35 - 7:39)
want the swampert skirmery team she's (7:36 - 7:41)
like okay so obviously you know make (7:39 - 7:42)
sure you catch all the swamperts all the (7:41 - 7:44)
or the mudkips all the skirmeries and (7:42 - 7:46)
then catch these other pokemon to flush (7:44 - 7:49)
out your team and then the irl guy was (7:46 - 7:50)
like the vigoroth (7:49 - 7:52)
um charizard team because that was like (7:50 - 7:53)
a little bit easier and then she had (7:52 - 7:55)
like a more advanced team (7:53 - 7:57)
because one of the rules was if i'm (7:55 - 8:00)
using mudkip um or skarmory no my other (7:57 - 8:02)
two partners on my team cannot so that (8:00 - 8:05)
was pretty cool um that makes sense but (8:02 - 8:07)
yeah spoiler i i didn't get a scar marie (8:05 - 8:10)
so because i didn't get a skarmory um (8:07 - 8:12)
well i did but it was over 1500 cp so i (8:10 - 8:13)
couldn't use it (8:12 - 8:14)
uh (8:13 - 8:17)
i took her i think uh we traded so i was (8:14 - 8:18)
like i'll just use knocked owl because i (8:17 - 8:20)
caught hoot hoot and then you'll use the (8:18 - 8:22)
skarmory you caught and then that'll be (8:20 - 8:24)
fine so that was like the like rng (8:22 - 8:26)
because you you're playing for an hour (8:24 - 8:27)
you don't know what's spawning in front (8:26 - 8:30)
of you and also like (8:27 - 8:32)
i was lucky enough to catch like six mod (8:30 - 8:34)
kips but four of my mudkips would have (8:32 - 8:36)
been way over the 1 500 cp for a (8:34 - 8:37)
swampert (8:36 - 8:40)
um so (8:37 - 8:42)
the first hour was like (8:40 - 8:44)
very chill but like very like okay we're (8:42 - 8:46)
catching pokemon for an hour this is (8:44 - 8:47)
cool hopefully you know i get everything (8:46 - 8:49)
on my list and (8:47 - 8:51)
for not having berries and only having (8:49 - 8:54)
pokeballs catching mud kips and (8:51 - 8:56)
slack-offs was incredibly stressful (8:54 - 8:58)
because you're like (8:56 - 8:59)
i don't want them to run and i don't (8:58 - 9:01)
have like ultras and i don't have golden (8:59 - 9:04)
razzes and like obviously if i was on my (9:01 - 9:05)
own account this would i'd catch (9:04 - 9:08)
everything (9:05 - 9:09)
and then it went into the powering up (9:08 - 9:11)
right so you're going through now i (9:09 - 9:15)
ended up catching 69 pokemon in an hour (9:11 - 9:17)
uh and then i was like don't have a (9:15 - 9:19)
skarmory okay i have the hoot hoot okay (9:17 - 9:21)
which ones of these are i'm going to (9:19 - 9:23)
power up i'm going to use an elite (9:21 - 9:24)
charge tm on (9:23 - 9:27)
swamper to get a hydro cannon (9:24 - 9:29)
and then (9:27 - 9:29)
for i guess i'm very (9:30 - 9:33)
lucky or (9:32 - 9:35)
knowledgeable about pokemon go so my (9:33 - 9:36)
coach didn't have to spend too much time (9:35 - 9:38)
with me she had to spend a lot of time (9:36 - 9:40)
with the other guy who (9:38 - 9:41)
uh (9:40 - 9:43)
decided not to check any of the cp and (9:41 - 9:45)
then throw away all his slack-offs (9:43 - 9:47)
except one (9:45 - 9:48)
and then uh (9:47 - 9:52)
power up his slack off to 1500 before (9:48 - 9:54)
they evolved it (9:52 - 9:55)
ah (9:54 - 9:57)
and then um (9:55 - 9:58)
let's just say instead of having a (9:57 - 10:01)
charizard he had a 1 500 cp charmeleon (9:58 - 10:06)
going into his battles (10:01 - 10:06)
but all the irl people were at a pretty (10:06 - 10:10)
i don't think any of the ir people were (10:08 - 10:12)
were they were all like (10:10 - 10:14)
didn't play pokemon go since the launch (10:12 - 10:17)
of the game so that was a little hectic (10:14 - 10:19)
um but the coolest part that i wanted to (10:17 - 10:20)
talk about is when we did get to the (10:19 - 10:23)
battles it was you you had six pokemon (10:20 - 10:25)
that you powered up to 1500 cp and so it (10:23 - 10:28)
was just like vgc you saw six pokemon so (10:25 - 10:30)
uh twitch made like a google doc showed (10:28 - 10:32)
all six pokemon everyone was using (10:30 - 10:35)
um like i was using the the knocked owl (10:32 - 10:37)
and the ariados and the galvantula and (10:35 - 10:38)
the (10:37 - 10:39)
um (10:38 - 10:41)
swampert and the (10:39 - 10:43)
whatever the other obama snow and then i (10:41 - 10:45)
saw their six and then i narrowed it (10:43 - 10:47)
down to three and it was best two out of (10:45 - 10:49)
three so (10:47 - 10:51)
i got team preview (10:49 - 10:52)
there was tv it was just through a (10:51 - 10:55)
google doc uh but that was the most (10:52 - 10:58)
exciting part and it really felt like i (10:55 - 11:00)
built it i built a team of six i looked (10:58 - 11:03)
at their team of six and i made the (11:00 - 11:04)
correct choices (11:03 - 11:08)
going in versus (11:04 - 11:08)
i just have three they just have three (11:08 - 11:12)
whoever has the better lead is clearly (11:10 - 11:15)
at the advantage of this match um (11:12 - 11:17)
and so that felt (11:15 - 11:19)
that felt actually really fun (11:17 - 11:22)
um and so i enjoyed my time with rivals (11:19 - 11:25)
i won four of my matches only lost one (11:22 - 11:28)
uh and my team came last so (11:25 - 11:30)
oh it wasn't my fault (11:28 - 11:32)
oh that's all that matters it wasn't my (11:30 - 11:33)
fault (11:32 - 11:37)
just like in unite (11:33 - 11:39)
just like in unite so i hope they do (11:37 - 11:42)
more of that because (11:39 - 11:43)
the (11:42 - 11:44)
i think (11:43 - 11:46)
watching the process of catching (11:44 - 11:49)
building and then doing it was actually (11:46 - 11:50)
really exciting to people they don't (11:49 - 11:52)
really get to see that kind of part of (11:50 - 11:54)
pokemon go that's true seeing how the (11:52 - 11:58)
burrito is stuffed (11:54 - 11:58)
uh speaking of pokemon go there is there (12:02 - 12:06)
the halloween event is happening right (12:05 - 12:09)
now they got more hat pokemon you want a (12:06 - 12:11)
piplup with a hat they got it you want (12:09 - 12:13)
pikachu with a hat (12:11 - 12:16)
always more hat so (12:13 - 12:18)
i have a fundamental question about the (12:16 - 12:21)
piplup and the pikachu hats (12:18 - 12:24)
do they feel really christmassy to you (12:21 - 12:25)
because they feel really christmassy to (12:24 - 12:27)
me (12:25 - 12:29)
i haven't seen them (12:27 - 12:31)
i guess i can see what you're saying (12:29 - 12:33)
i think with the pikachu the bow tie (12:31 - 12:34)
throws it off because it looks like a (12:33 - 12:36)
candy cane bow tie (12:34 - 12:37)
for (12:36 - 12:39)
christmas yeah (12:37 - 12:40)
well i mean the people in my (12:39 - 12:41)
neighborhood have started putting up (12:40 - 12:43)
their christmas lights so (12:41 - 12:45)
maybe we have a very short window (12:43 - 12:48)
i just feel like (12:45 - 12:50)
both people up (12:48 - 12:52)
when i first saw it i'm like am i (12:50 - 12:54)
getting the wrong event because this is (12:52 - 12:56)
really christmassy (12:54 - 12:57)
and then i looked at the graphic i'm (12:56 - 13:00)
like no this is the right hats they just (12:57 - 13:02)
look (13:00 - 13:04)
christmasy (13:02 - 13:05)
you know it's funny it's like i'm (13:04 - 13:07)
scrolling through pokemon go live and (13:05 - 13:09)
they like revamped their website what (13:07 - 13:11)
like two months ago or something (13:09 - 13:12)
and they do the thing (13:11 - 13:14)
where they have like the little shiny (13:12 - 13:16)
symbol next to pokemon like one star (13:14 - 13:18)
raids is glaring slowpoke marcos greggy (13:16 - 13:20)
yeah mask esper and then like the little (13:18 - 13:22)
shiny symbols on marco and yamask (13:20 - 13:24)
but if you like go through the shiny (13:22 - 13:27)
symbols on more things than not and it's (13:24 - 13:29)
like that's something that like fans (13:27 - 13:31)
have always made like those like (13:29 - 13:32)
graphics of what's shiny and what's not (13:31 - 13:34)
but there's nothing the pokemon company (13:32 - 13:36)
has ever done because it was (13:34 - 13:38)
always like (13:36 - 13:40)
all or nothing (13:38 - 13:42)
uh it's like it could either be shiny or (13:40 - 13:45)
it can't so i feel like there's gonna (13:42 - 13:48)
i wonder what year or what point that (13:45 - 13:49)
it's just (13:48 - 13:51)
everything is like a chance of shiny in (13:49 - 13:52)
pogo and we don't have to have this (13:51 - 13:54)
little like (13:52 - 13:54)
well (13:54 - 13:57)
uh everything in eggs is shiny except (13:54 - 14:03)
for golet and it's it's a little silly (13:57 - 14:05)
uh there's a spooky cup (14:03 - 14:07)
which is cool uh it's or the halloween (14:05 - 14:09)
cup i should say (14:07 - 14:12)
that's happening um this the season of (14:09 - 14:15)
mischief story goes to the next part (14:12 - 14:16)
there's special time research there's (14:15 - 14:18)
some really good event bonuses this time (14:16 - 14:20)
around twice the transfer candy always (14:18 - 14:22)
on twice the catch candy always on twice (14:20 - 14:23)
the hatch candy always on and then (14:22 - 14:25)
guaranteed xl candy when walking with (14:23 - 14:27)
your buddy (14:25 - 14:29)
so (14:27 - 14:30)
really really really good bonuses (14:29 - 14:32)
happening the three costume pokemon we (14:30 - 14:35)
talked about they added a giant pikachu (14:32 - 14:37)
pumpkin head which actually looks really (14:35 - 14:39)
good in game yeah it looks pretty good (14:37 - 14:41)
like like they somebody at the modeling (14:39 - 14:43)
team figured out how to make the model (14:41 - 14:45)
and it's not clipping really weird like (14:43 - 14:46)
other things (14:45 - 14:49)
they added some more face stickers uh (14:46 - 14:51)
they added the halloween music they (14:49 - 14:53)
released gallerian slow king which i (14:51 - 14:55)
think was broken at first but i believe (14:53 - 14:57)
they fixed it they turned spinner rack (14:55 - 15:00)
shiny um that is the new shiny this (14:57 - 15:02)
event (15:00 - 15:04)
so uh (15:02 - 15:08)
don't ignore those spinner racks (15:04 - 15:08)
and i don't want a shiny spinner rack (15:08 - 15:13)
so that's okay (15:11 - 15:15)
and then on october 22nd there's a part (15:13 - 15:18)
two that's when phantom trevident (15:15 - 15:21)
pumpkin boo and gorgeys will appear for (15:18 - 15:24)
those who are unfamiliar with x and y (15:21 - 15:27)
uh and have not known anything about (15:24 - 15:29)
pumpkaboo there are four sizes of (15:27 - 15:31)
pumpkaboo which will be added to pokemon (15:29 - 15:32)
go there's the small size the average (15:31 - 15:35)
size the large size and then the (15:32 - 15:37)
supersize and so (15:35 - 15:38)
um (15:37 - 15:40)
i wonder how easy it's going to be able (15:38 - 15:41)
to tell in the game you have to listen (15:40 - 15:43)
to the cry because they have different (15:41 - 15:45)
but i mean now that's in in the regular (15:43 - 15:47)
games but it's going to be that hard and (15:45 - 15:49)
didn't go (15:47 - 15:51)
maybe i just (15:49 - 15:54)
maybe you can tell from looking at them (15:51 - 15:55)
i mean (15:54 - 15:57)
you should be able i mean the problem (15:55 - 15:58)
it's (15:57 - 16:00)
it's like you can usually tell three of (15:58 - 16:02)
the four (16:00 - 16:04)
and then it's it's unless you have all (16:02 - 16:05)
four it's like it's kind of hard to put (16:04 - 16:07)
them in what order but there's they're (16:05 - 16:10)
saying here on niantic's website small (16:07 - 16:12)
and average are easily able to find in (16:10 - 16:15)
the wild and large and supersized are (16:12 - 16:19)
going to be rare in the wild (16:15 - 16:20)
um (16:19 - 16:23)
and if you definitely a hundred percent (16:20 - 16:26)
want only average size pumpkaboo it will (16:23 - 16:27)
be in one star raids (16:26 - 16:30)
[Laughter] (16:27 - 16:32)
there will be no super size or no small (16:30 - 16:35)
it's only average in one star raids (16:32 - 16:37)
and then darkrai will be back and then (16:35 - 16:40)
mega apps will make its debut (16:37 - 16:40)
um and that's kind of it that's kind of (16:41 - 16:44)
our (16:43 - 16:47)
pokemon go minute but (16:44 - 16:48)
i don't know they kind of (16:47 - 16:50)
niatik always kind of kills it around (16:48 - 16:51)
halloween i feel like their halloween (16:50 - 16:53)
events are always no they don't they (16:51 - 16:56)
always forget to focus on ghosts and (16:53 - 16:57)
that's all giggling (16:56 - 16:59)
and nothing but giggling (16:57 - 17:02)
first time ever (16:59 - 17:02)
i i don't remember any other (17:03 - 17:09)
halloween pokemon go events so (17:06 - 17:11)
sure this this is great knock it out of (17:09 - 17:13)
the part again i could not i could not (17:11 - 17:15)
tell you (17:13 - 17:17)
at all what happened last year there are (17:15 - 17:20)
costumes weren't there people like (17:17 - 17:22)
i'm sure there were hats there are hats (17:20 - 17:24)
is that when sableye looking like a (17:22 - 17:26)
liquid came out i remember that yeah it (17:24 - 17:29)
was also when gengar had like the (17:26 - 17:30)
tim burton (17:29 - 17:32)
costume going on (17:30 - 17:35)
oh is gengar in a s uh banette (17:32 - 17:37)
yeah that was it yeah i remember that (17:35 - 17:40)
vaguely a lot of zippers and a lot of a (17:37 - 17:41)
lot of stitches what stitches this is a (17:40 - 17:44)
tim burton costume that oh you like a (17:41 - 17:46)
nightmare before christmas like (17:44 - 17:48)
stitching across the mouths of my face (17:46 - 17:50)
never seen that movie i will never see (17:48 - 17:54)
that movie i'm sure (17:50 - 17:54)
some tcg news here is mew (17:55 - 18:00)
v-max (17:58 - 18:03)
bolton v-max and more in pokemon tcg i (18:00 - 18:05)
don't know i really struggled with that (18:03 - 18:07)
headline this is pokemon.com (18:05 - 18:09)
use your tcg battle styles of the (18:07 - 18:10)
upcoming sword and shield fusion strike (18:09 - 18:12)
containing more than (18:10 - 18:16)
260 cards gosh this expansion (18:12 - 18:18)
introduces the new battle style called (18:16 - 18:20)
fusion strike (18:18 - 18:22)
embrace the fluidity (18:20 - 18:24)
of this style and the adaptability of (18:22 - 18:26)
the new pokemon v while also using (18:24 - 18:27)
powerful new single strike and rapid (18:26 - 18:30)
strike cards and don't overlook the (18:27 - 18:32)
power of several pokemon v-max appearing (18:30 - 18:34)
in giganta max form (18:32 - 18:37)
they show off mew they shot bolton they (18:34 - 18:41)
shot off huntail huntail and again (18:37 - 18:44)
look at that (18:41 - 18:48)
both of them are fused what's okay (18:44 - 18:49)
what is the difference between the (18:48 - 18:50)
strikes (18:49 - 18:54)
yeah i mean well it's (18:50 - 18:56)
correct me if i'm wrong but if i believe (18:54 - 18:59)
like you pick one of the battle styles (18:56 - 19:03)
and then you only include cards that (18:59 - 19:06)
have that same battle style in your deck (19:03 - 19:09)
so there will be cards that are tuned (19:06 - 19:11)
towards a particular battle style (19:09 - 19:14)
so is a fusion let you use that it's (19:11 - 19:15)
just a new either (19:14 - 19:17)
or is it a third category it's a third (19:15 - 19:21)
one so there's there's uh rapid single (19:17 - 19:24)
and then fusion so now there's three um (19:21 - 19:25)
i can kind of break this down a little (19:24 - 19:26)
bit better single strike pokemon are (19:25 - 19:28)
normally pokemon that just hit harder (19:26 - 19:30)
but don't do anything too special it's (19:28 - 19:31)
usually like some extra plus tens or (19:30 - 19:35)
some extra plus 20s um they they (19:31 - 19:37)
are simpler but they hit a little bit (19:35 - 19:38)
harder somebody's gonna be like well but (19:37 - 19:41)
this car yeah there are exceptions but (19:38 - 19:43)
that's like the general feel in vanguard (19:41 - 19:45)
we call that an unga bunga deck (19:43 - 19:47)
you don't have to think (19:45 - 19:50)
just unga bunga hit him hard (19:47 - 19:53)
and then rapid strike is more like (19:50 - 19:54)
uh (19:53 - 19:56)
not hitting as hard but maybe more (19:54 - 19:58)
acceleration maybe more like going into (19:56 - 20:00)
your deck more setup combos (19:58 - 20:03)
yeah more combos perfect (20:00 - 20:04)
and then i don't know what the heck (20:03 - 20:06)
fusion's trick is doing they show a (20:04 - 20:08)
fusion strike mute my confusion comes (20:06 - 20:11)
because fusion strike huntail says (20:08 - 20:13)
single strike jammer (20:11 - 20:15)
fusion strike gorbach says rapid strike (20:13 - 20:17)
canceller (20:15 - 20:19)
because they they prevent those (20:17 - 20:21)
they're specifically so they prevent (20:19 - 20:23)
those decks from working so is fusion (20:21 - 20:25)
like (20:23 - 20:28)
it's just a counter is it the blue is it (20:25 - 20:30)
hard blue magic deck (20:28 - 20:34)
controller controls shuts down (20:30 - 20:34)
yeah fusion sounds like a more control (20:34 - 20:39)
uh which is shutting down other (20:38 - 20:41)
abilities (20:39 - 20:43)
boo (20:41 - 20:45)
uh (20:43 - 20:46)
here's the thing people are really (20:45 - 20:48)
excited about the set because there's (20:46 - 20:50)
like a secret rare mew looks really (20:48 - 20:52)
great i'm sure bobby wants it (20:50 - 20:54)
is it shiny (20:52 - 20:57)
260 cards (20:54 - 20:59)
just just don't even buy packs just buy (20:57 - 21:00)
the card you want like you're not gonna (20:59 - 21:02)
pull it that's (21:00 - 21:04)
that that that's the problem with these (21:02 - 21:07)
sets the like chilling rains is enormous (21:04 - 21:09)
and so is evolving skies that it feels (21:07 - 21:10)
like you don't get anything you want (21:09 - 21:11)
because they're just (21:10 - 21:13)
so filler heavy because they have so (21:11 - 21:15)
many cards (21:13 - 21:16)
and even if you get something rare (21:15 - 21:17)
you're like oh this isn't the rare one (21:16 - 21:18)
because (21:17 - 21:20)
cool i got another graplock v what am i (21:18 - 21:22)
gonna do with the grab block the only (21:20 - 21:25)
way is to buy a case (21:22 - 21:25)
yeah and then (21:26 - 21:29)
you have (21:28 - 21:31)
seven thousand filler cards and like (21:29 - 21:35)
five seven sell the fillers exactly (21:31 - 21:37)
now buy singles kids (21:35 - 21:38)
yeah (21:37 - 21:39)
yeah i (21:38 - 21:41)
we have to see more cards from fusion (21:39 - 21:43)
striker or what they're doing but 260 (21:41 - 21:44)
cards (21:43 - 21:46)
no thank you that's so many that's a lot (21:44 - 21:47)
of cards (21:46 - 21:49)
[Laughter] (21:47 - 21:51)
it's all the cards (21:49 - 21:54)
uh also off pokemon.com the 25 pokemon (21:51 - 21:57)
25 album is now available digitally and (21:54 - 21:59)
on cd don't make my mistake go to target (21:57 - 22:01)
walk down the vinyl aisle and be like (21:59 - 22:03)
where's the vinyl that doesn't come out (22:01 - 22:06)
till february yup (22:03 - 22:07)
i did not know that (22:06 - 22:09)
and i didn't even think of getting the (22:07 - 22:11)
cd because i was like so set on like i'm (22:09 - 22:12)
just gonna get the vinyl because that's (22:11 - 22:14)
the cool thing (22:12 - 22:16)
so i gotta go back on the target cd like (22:14 - 22:18)
is there any (22:16 - 22:20)
target does have an exclusive um i think (22:18 - 22:22)
it just comes with like bonus stickers (22:20 - 22:24)
and i think the cases or the (22:22 - 22:27)
cover is different or (22:24 - 22:29)
whatever the book the thing that goes (22:27 - 22:31)
inside yeah the insert there's no like (22:29 - 22:33)
bonus songs it's just there's probably a (22:31 - 22:34)
sticker on it and then it comes with (22:33 - 22:36)
stickers did you guys listen to the jay (22:34 - 22:40)
balvin song yeah that is finally of them (22:36 - 22:42)
all finally somebody understood the (22:40 - 22:43)
assignment (22:42 - 22:46)
somebody made a pokemon song with (22:43 - 22:50)
pokemon in it i am such a huge fan now (22:46 - 22:53)
i didn't understand a word that was (22:50 - 22:55)
being said (22:53 - 22:59)
i mean it was like you'd be on fire like (22:55 - 23:01)
charizard yeah i mean i looked up a (22:59 - 23:03)
translation after but the first time i (23:01 - 23:04)
watched i'm like oh i don't know this (23:03 - 23:07)
like the song title is ten (23:04 - 23:09)
audio (23:07 - 23:12)
i think it's like be careful (23:09 - 23:14)
or it's like cuidado (23:12 - 23:17)
oh right that sounded fancy (23:14 - 23:20)
uh i believe it's beware (23:17 - 23:21)
yeah (23:20 - 23:24)
take care be careful be careful beware (23:21 - 23:26)
something like that (23:24 - 23:26)
um but that video is really good and the (23:27 - 23:32)
song actually has pokemon and i'm (23:30 - 23:33)
impressed and (23:32 - 23:34)
uh (23:33 - 23:37)
they win they win they wow (23:34 - 23:39)
they filmed the assignment (23:37 - 23:41)
they're the person in the group project (23:39 - 23:43)
that was like no this is pokemon related (23:41 - 23:45)
greg none of this none of that (23:43 - 23:47)
unfortunate thing though is that (23:45 - 23:50)
he cheated off bad bunny we all know (23:47 - 23:50)
this (23:50 - 23:52)
just bad bunny wasn't asked to be on the (23:50 - 23:53)
album (23:52 - 23:55)
um i think for our patrons for the the (23:53 - 23:57)
people that get the pa the the like (23:55 - 23:59)
event tickets that we do every month i (23:57 - 24:01)
think we'll do like a listening party (23:59 - 24:02)
for that um (24:01 - 24:03)
[Music] (24:02 - 24:04)
in the dis obviously we have to do (24:03 - 24:05)
everything through the discord because (24:04 - 24:10)
they slack has zero audio tools (24:05 - 24:11)
unfortunately i think even the paid (24:10 - 24:13)
slack doesn't have any audio tools but (24:11 - 24:15)
um (24:13 - 24:16)
i think we'll do a listening party for (24:15 - 24:18)
that because uh if i don't set aside (24:16 - 24:20)
time to listen to this album i will not (24:18 - 24:22)
listen to this album so (24:20 - 24:23)
uh (24:22 - 24:25)
i have to listen to the music you you (24:23 - 24:27)
really only listen to spoken (24:25 - 24:29)
uh i i came back i came back to music (24:27 - 24:32)
i'm in the kids came back to a (24:29 - 24:34)
music verse just say k-pop and music in (24:32 - 24:37)
the same sentence oh come on you have (24:34 - 24:40)
one person that you listen to one that (24:37 - 24:42)
is not listening to music that is (24:40 - 24:45)
standing an individual i am i'm very (24:42 - 24:47)
entertainment actually i i've listened (24:45 - 24:48)
to a lot of bts this past week only (24:47 - 24:51)
because my wife had a 10-hour bts (24:48 - 24:54)
session with our friend and uh i was (24:51 - 24:56)
there and (24:54 - 24:56)
what are you what do you do when you're (24:56 - 25:00)
working out what do you listen to oh (24:58 - 25:01)
wait (25:00 - 25:04)
i was just like when (25:01 - 25:04)
okay (25:07 - 25:09)
and when i'm washing the dishes and when (25:10 - 25:12)
i'm cleaning the house i do have (25:11 - 25:15)
podcasts on that is not listening to (25:12 - 25:16)
music and then it's not clanging and (25:15 - 25:18)
banging (25:16 - 25:20)
i understand you i understand you would (25:18 - 25:22)
need music to clang and bang that is (25:20 - 25:24)
that is true i've listened to podcasts (25:22 - 25:25)
while clanging and banging previously oh (25:24 - 25:27)
i can't i can't i can't i can't have (25:25 - 25:29)
them chatting in my ears and i'm trying (25:27 - 25:30)
to count my reps (25:29 - 25:32)
that makes sense well if you're just (25:30 - 25:34)
running you could probably if i'm on the (25:32 - 25:36)
bike yeah i'll listen i will listen to (25:34 - 25:40)
that no mark this is 2021 no cardio (25:36 - 25:42)
cardio eats gains no this is not the (25:40 - 25:44)
year of cardio sorry (25:42 - 25:46)
when i don't move i have to do some (25:44 - 25:48)
cardio because i'm literally sitting in (25:46 - 25:50)
this room for 16 hours (25:48 - 25:52)
uh they said pokemon 25 album is now (25:50 - 25:54)
available digitally or with cds are sold (25:52 - 25:56)
there is also a special cover special (25:54 - 25:58)
colored vinyl of the album coming in (25:56 - 26:00)
february in celebration of pokemon day (25:58 - 26:03)
um and i think again there is two vinyls (26:00 - 26:04)
there is (26:03 - 26:06)
the i think it's a yellow vinyl which (26:04 - 26:08)
actually looks really good and then (26:06 - 26:10)
there's a target special vinyl which is (26:08 - 26:12)
like the pokeball which oddly enough (26:10 - 26:13)
doesn't look as good i don't know they (26:12 - 26:14)
picked a really good yellow for the (26:13 - 26:17)
vinyl i don't know it's the best color (26:14 - 26:19)
what what are we at for time here uh oh (26:17 - 26:20)
we got time okay that'll just switch (26:19 - 26:22)
over to (26:20 - 26:23)
i was i was i was thinking it was like (26:22 - 26:27)
dude i split here take a break half (26:23 - 26:30)
i was half on board buying a cd then i (26:27 - 26:31)
thought i will (26:30 - 26:33)
never listen to this (26:31 - 26:36)
and i don't want it in my house (26:33 - 26:39)
next to the burger king gold-plated (26:36 - 26:41)
cards no no (26:39 - 26:43)
this is not going to make money people (26:41 - 26:44)
are going to be like this isn't even (26:43 - 26:46)
pokemon related except for the j balvin (26:44 - 26:48)
song and they're the only one that (26:46 - 26:49)
understood the assignment and it's gonna (26:48 - 26:50)
be that's why we need the listening (26:49 - 26:54)
party yeah i see i could put the cd like (26:50 - 26:56)
on this shelf (26:54 - 26:59)
but then it would block something else (26:56 - 27:01)
although something important the pikachu (26:59 - 27:04)
game boy picture frame is empty if the (27:01 - 27:07)
cd would fit in that we could do it (27:04 - 27:08)
but no (27:07 - 27:09)
um (27:08 - 27:10)
so (27:09 - 27:13)
good timing i guess and i do i do like (27:10 - 27:14)
that they're doing this even though it's (27:13 - 27:16)
like really expensive but they (27:14 - 27:18)

turntable that captures the whimsy and (28:30 - 28:34)
wonder of the pokemon world the orbit (28:32 - 28:36)
turntable produced in calibration of (28:34 - 28:38)
u-turn audio and pokemon center features (28:36 - 28:40)

powerful as blastoise hydro pump (28:44 - 28:50)
the first time you play it pretty (28:48 - 28:52)
powerful in pokemon unite (28:50 - 28:54)
if you happen to prefer a personalized (28:52 - 28:56)
experience while listening to the (28:54 - 28:58)
recently released album uh the right (28:56 - 29:00)
pair of headphones is an essential (28:58 - 29:03)
accessory pokemon center collaborated (29:00 - 29:05)
with grotto labs to produce wooden and (29:03 - 29:07)
metal headphones celebrating the spirit (29:05 - 29:09)
of pokemon enhancing your quality of (29:07 - 29:10)
music the housing of the wooden (29:09 - 29:13)

rich tonal qualities while the housing (29:13 - 29:17)
of the metal headphones are bring they (29:14 - 29:18)
don't say what metal it is bring a (29:17 - 29:22)
degree of precision to your music (29:18 - 29:22)
i still don't understand how we got back (29:22 - 29:27)
to vinyl (29:24 - 29:30)
is not bad it's it's not good bad the (29:27 - 29:31)
first (29:30 - 29:33)
three times you play it and then from (29:31 - 29:35)
then on it is (29:33 - 29:36)
hot (29:35 - 29:37)
garbage (29:36 - 29:40)
i like vinyl i do it's it's it's a (29:37 - 29:41)
warmer tone (29:40 - 29:43)
for the first three plays and then it (29:41 - 29:45)
becomes hot (29:43 - 29:48)
garbage full of crap because (29:45 - 29:49)
you naps i like the cracks and i like (29:48 - 29:51)
the snaps yeah (29:49 - 29:55)
but you but also just don't get a crappy (29:51 - 29:56)
90 (29:55 - 29:58)
80 turntable from target because that (29:56 - 30:00)
thing's gonna (29:58 - 30:01)
not be great (30:00 - 30:03)
here's the thing i do need a new (30:01 - 30:05)
turntable so i i am not one of those (30:03 - 30:08)
vinyl people that are like it sounds (30:05 - 30:10)
perfect it's it's the best way to listen (30:08 - 30:13)
because like flack audio and the the (30:10 - 30:15)
[Laughter] (30:13 - 30:17)
monitor speakers i have on my desk (30:15 - 30:18)
are (30:17 - 30:20)
are a million times better than what a (30:18 - 30:23)
vinyl record can spin out and produce (30:20 - 30:24)
for me (30:23 - 30:27)
but there is something that you can this (30:24 - 30:30)
is why i like vinyl when you got (30:27 - 30:32)
company over or it's just you and your (30:30 - 30:34)
significant other and your house is (30:32 - 30:38)
clean and you lit that candle (30:34 - 30:41)
and you put that vinyl on that is like a (30:38 - 30:43)
mood that is like a thing that you (30:41 - 30:45)
cannot buy (30:43 - 30:47)
and and the nice thing about it (30:45 - 30:50)
it's not that great i did it for 15 (30:47 - 30:52)
years (30:50 - 30:54)
i (30:52 - 30:54)
recently within the past two years have (30:54 - 30:58)
gotten back to (30:56 - 31:03)
listening to albums and not just songs (30:58 - 31:04)
and one of the nice things about vinyl (31:03 - 31:08)
is it enforces that album experience you (31:04 - 31:10)
have to listen to the songs in the order (31:08 - 31:12)
that they were selecting like four bands (31:10 - 31:15)
write album experiences anymore most (31:12 - 31:19)
bands write single experiences (31:15 - 31:19)
i don't think that's accurate (31:20 - 31:24)
like these songs don't even float (31:22 - 31:27)
together (31:24 - 31:27)
it's a lot you you cannot tell me that (31:27 - 31:32)
your pop princesses have created a (31:30 - 31:35)
concept album around pokemon (31:32 - 31:36)
let me put together a list that you'll (31:35 - 31:39)
never listen to because you don't know (31:36 - 31:41)
let me tell you there's no tame in on (31:39 - 31:45)
vinyl and i'm very upset about this (31:41 - 31:45)

look forward okay i will i will go to (31:59 - 32:04)
seoul this week i will report back i (32:01 - 32:06)

the i was told by multiple people that (33:46 - 33:53)
this turntable is incredible but that (33:49 - 33:56)
the pokemon tax on it is is pretty much (33:53 - 33:57)
double they said that you get the same (33:56 - 34:00)
turntable with no pikachu (33:57 - 34:03)
for like 220 and they're charging 380 (34:00 - 34:04)

a basement you don't love it (34:36 - 34:39)
a vinyl (34:37 - 34:41)
and i understand that it is a (34:39 - 34:44)
fundamentally flawed system it is very (34:41 - 34:47)
fly i in my basement have the greatest (34:44 - 34:49)
vinyl album (34:47 - 34:51)
bongos bongos bongos (34:49 - 34:53)

it's amazing so don't at me that i don't (34:53 - 34:58)
know about vinyl i lived it i was there (34:56 - 35:00)
when vinyl was created it was the only (34:58 - 35:02)
act like (35:00 - 35:05)
you weren't you were a child look when (35:02 - 35:07)
vital came back i was a hipster i needed (35:05 - 35:09)
to get into something i know what went (35:07 - 35:11)
wrong in my life (35:09 - 35:14)
remember the day (35:11 - 35:15)
and you have to be (35:14 - 35:18)
from a certain area of the northeast (35:15 - 35:19)
even understand all the words that will (35:18 - 35:21)
be coming out of my mouth in a minute i (35:19 - 35:25)
remember the day i went to caldor to get (35:21 - 35:28)
george michael's faith on vinyl (35:25 - 35:29)
hey (35:28 - 35:31)
okay (35:29 - 35:34)
dude did you ever have (35:31 - 35:35)
the (35:34 - 35:37)
a device on your turntable that you (35:35 - 35:38)
could stack (35:37 - 35:39)
for (35:38 - 35:42)
yes vinyls on top and they would drop (35:39 - 35:44)
yes and then usually (35:42 - 35:46)
oh yeah look we knew the tech back in (35:44 - 35:48)
the day (35:46 - 35:50)
here's the thing you would buy two (35:48 - 35:52)
copies of the album and you'd put side b (35:50 - 35:55)
face up so that after side a (35:52 - 35:58)
on the first one finished then side b (35:55 - 35:59)
would drop down and you didn't have to (35:58 - 36:01)
flip the record over (35:59 - 36:04)
that sounds like a dream (36:01 - 36:04)
i had a vinyl of a spider-man adventure (36:04 - 36:10)
that came with a comic book (36:07 - 36:12)
yeah i should uh (36:10 - 36:13)
i should (36:12 - 36:15)
drop my vinyl player off at a goodwill (36:13 - 36:18)
because it ain't it's not going with (36:15 - 36:19)
it's not making it i don't think i've (36:18 - 36:21)
ever replaced the needle on it either (36:19 - 36:22)
and that (36:21 - 36:23)
like the needle is like 40 bucks and i'm (36:22 - 36:24)
pretty sure that (36:23 - 36:28)
the player itself was 120. (36:24 - 36:29)
this is what they don't tell you about (36:28 - 36:31)
vinyl you have to replace the needle you (36:29 - 36:33)
have to place pieces on like it's it's (36:31 - 36:36)
the same as a car (36:33 - 36:38)
cars aren't great either all right (36:36 - 36:39)
all right (36:38 - 36:41)
let's take a break we come back we got (36:39 - 36:42)

ever made for collectors (37:27 - 37:30)
i'm losing my mind like this set is so (37:31 - 37:36)

pearl news uh so we're gonna talk about (37:51 - 37:55)
that (37:53 - 37:56)
this (37:55 - 37:59)
there was a couple outlets that got (37:56 - 38:02)
uh early first-hand impressions of the (37:59 - 38:04)
game obviously very controlled because (38:02 - 38:05)
the pokemon company slash nintendo (38:04 - 38:08)
always wants to control the narrative um (38:05 - 38:10)
we're gonna pull my stuff uh we're gonna (38:08 - 38:11)
pull this stuff off game informer my (38:10 - 38:12)
friend john (38:11 - 38:14)
john carson who works at game informer (38:12 - 38:15)
did this stuff so it was like really (38:14 - 38:17)
cool to see a friend (38:15 - 38:18)
be able to play the game early and then (38:17 - 38:21)
talk about it and and stuff so i know (38:18 - 38:22)
ign did some stuff i think like game (38:21 - 38:25)
spot did some stuff but we'll just do (38:22 - 38:26)
the gaming format it's all the same they (38:25 - 38:28)
all got the literally the same exact (38:26 - 38:30)
preview (38:28 - 38:30)
um but then i also i also (38:30 - 38:36)
covered this on the youtube channel (38:33 - 38:38)
youtube.comcast if you want to see my my (38:36 - 38:39)
earlier (38:38 - 38:42)
um thoughts on that too (38:39 - 38:44)
so (38:42 - 38:44)
comes out november 19th we're getting (38:45 - 38:49)
close (38:47 - 38:50)
they (38:49 - 38:54)
almost a month away (38:50 - 38:54)
they show (38:56 - 38:59)
[Music] (38:57 - 39:00)
okay before we go through this let's (38:59 - 39:02)
talk about the thing that everyone's (39:00 - 39:04)
talking about okay (39:02 - 39:06)
what is everybody talking about (39:04 - 39:08)
experience share is (39:06 - 39:10)
not a toggle (39:08 - 39:12)
once again (39:10 - 39:15)
uh but that's that's the norm now (39:12 - 39:18)
i don't know (39:15 - 39:18)
i don't know why this is such a point of (39:18 - 39:23)
contention for some people (39:20 - 39:25)
i mean i understand because i originally (39:23 - 39:27)
had the issue back in the day it's like (39:25 - 39:30)
i want to control the leveling of mine (39:27 - 39:33)
pokemon i don't want it just to be a (39:30 - 39:35)
blanket (39:33 - 39:38)
yes i i get that but when they turned (39:35 - 39:40)
the toggle off (39:38 - 39:44)
they also were they also introduced pc (39:40 - 39:45)
anywhere (39:44 - 39:46)
right (39:45 - 39:49)
and so like in let's go pikachu let's go (39:46 - 39:52)
eevee it was experience share always on (39:49 - 39:54)
but also the first game (39:52 - 39:56)
that no matter where you are take out a (39:54 - 39:59)
pokemon put in a pokemon but those are (39:56 - 40:01)
completely unrelated (39:59 - 40:02)
what what does one have to do with the (40:01 - 40:03)
other (40:02 - 40:05)
because like if you only wanted (40:03 - 40:08)
one pokemon to get experience you could (40:05 - 40:11)
just dump the other five pokemon (40:08 - 40:13)
and if you wanted to do the like the (40:11 - 40:14)
chain thing where it's like i'm gonna (40:13 - 40:16)
send out you level one i'm gonna switch (40:14 - 40:17)
right away to the level ten and then (40:16 - 40:19)
we're both going to get experience (40:17 - 40:20)
because that's how you would do it (40:19 - 40:21)
anyways (40:20 - 40:22)
um (40:21 - 40:24)
you just put the other four in the box (40:22 - 40:25)
but (40:24 - 40:27)
that doesn't work it's like i have my (40:25 - 40:28)
team (40:27 - 40:29)
i'm bringing my team (40:28 - 40:31)
[Laughter] (40:29 - 40:34)
but this is the real issue (40:31 - 40:38)
and i blame the parents of millennials i (40:34 - 40:39)
don't blame the millennials themselves (40:38 - 40:41)
yeah it's the parents problem which is (40:39 - 40:43)
basically i'm gonna say the boomers but (40:41 - 40:46)
who knows (40:43 - 40:48)
if a pokemon does not participate in a (40:46 - 40:50)
battle (40:48 - 40:53)
and i have not designated that pokemon (40:50 - 40:56)
to receive experience why is it getting (40:53 - 40:57)
experienced because they were there (40:56 - 41:02)
literally done nothing but sit in a box (40:57 - 41:04)
get this this is the problem with my (41:02 - 41:07)
shiny bug quest playthrough through (41:04 - 41:12)
pokemon shield frost moth has legit (41:07 - 41:13)
done (41:12 - 41:16)
jack duty (41:13 - 41:20)
because not has never been in a battle (41:16 - 41:21)
but (41:20 - 41:23)
since i had to catch it at level 40 or (41:21 - 41:25)
whatever in the field whatever the the (41:23 - 41:27)
base for a snowman is that you can get (41:25 - 41:30)
the lowest i didn't breed it i caught it (41:27 - 41:35)
fresh caught snow shiny in the field (41:30 - 41:37)
it is at level 50 now (41:35 - 41:39)
because it keeps getting experience for (41:37 - 41:40)
doing (41:39 - 41:44)
nothing it is observing and watching and (41:40 - 41:47)
taking notes as an educator (41:44 - 41:49)
having having (41:47 - 41:52)
examples at the front of the class is a (41:49 - 41:55)
valuable learning tool yes they don't (41:52 - 41:57)
learn as much as perhaps doing the (41:55 - 41:59)
battle but they do learn something from (41:57 - 42:03)
watching and you cannot ignore that (41:59 - 42:06)
aspect of education i i can and also i (42:03 - 42:09)
like to play pokemon games where it's (42:06 - 42:11)
like that you got the guy in the front (42:09 - 42:14)
or gal or non-binary whichever the (42:11 - 42:16)
pokemon identifies as it could be a (42:14 - 42:18)
magnemite correct (42:16 - 42:20)
and like (42:18 - 42:22)
then it gets it's it levels over the (42:20 - 42:24)
next guy or growl or non-binary and then (42:22 - 42:27)
you say you move it up the line and then (42:24 - 42:29)
you keep moving them up the line so that (42:27 - 42:32)
they level evenly but now it's like i (42:29 - 42:34)
poor larvesta (42:32 - 42:37)
is doing all the work look larvae ain't (42:34 - 42:39)
evolving until level (42:37 - 42:42)
462 anyways like nobody could give the (42:39 - 42:45)
poor kid a break (42:42 - 42:47)
yeah but okay so if you were like uh (42:45 - 42:48)
pokemon games are too easy i don't want (42:47 - 42:50)
to be over leveled (42:48 - 42:52)
that is still your choice like if you if (42:50 - 42:54)
you're going into um if you're going (42:52 - 42:57)
into ray han and reha i don't even know (42:54 - 42:59)
what level reyhon's pokemon are uh if if (42:57 - 43:01)
that dude's pokemon are level 45 and (42:59 - 43:03)
your pokemon is is 42 and you're like i (43:01 - 43:05)
don't want to be above 42 because it's (43:03 - 43:07)
gonna be just put that book by the box (43:05 - 43:09)
it's it's it's fine it's not going (43:07 - 43:11)
anywhere you access the pc anywhere this (43:09 - 43:13)
pokemon hit 42 that's where i want to be (43:11 - 43:15)
drop in the box move on it's fine (43:13 - 43:17)
like you you're still in complete (43:15 - 43:19)
control of your pokemon levels to be (43:17 - 43:20)
like oh my pokemon are getting (43:19 - 43:21)
experience too fast (43:20 - 43:24)
at any point no matter where you are you (43:21 - 43:25)
can go (43:24 - 43:29)
slide that pokemon into a box and (43:25 - 43:30)
it stops getting experience at that (43:29 - 43:31)
point (43:30 - 43:33)
i don't know it's just like it (43:31 - 43:34)
i (43:33 - 43:37)
i see the complaint and i i you're like (43:34 - 43:38)
the (43:37 - 43:40)
being able to have more control of your (43:38 - 43:42)
game is not something i would want to (43:40 - 43:44)
take away from a player (43:42 - 43:47)
i still think that control is there (43:44 - 43:50)
i am more shocked (43:47 - 43:53)
that this is just so controversial (43:50 - 43:55)
versus reversal this is so much of a (43:53 - 43:58)
controversy when (43:55 - 44:01)
almost every other jrpg (43:58 - 44:03)
this has just been a thing (44:01 - 44:07)
forever like i every final fantasy every (44:03 - 44:11)
persona octopath traveler the bravely (44:07 - 44:14)
like default it's just (44:11 - 44:14)
it was it's just a thing the fact that (44:15 - 44:20)
pokemon grinding levels isn't fun (44:17 - 44:22)
the fact that pokemon had like (44:20 - 44:24)
even earlier pokemon games people should (44:22 - 44:26)
be more mad that like in earlier pokemon (44:24 - 44:27)
games you don't get experience here (44:26 - 44:29)
until like the seventh gym and one of (44:27 - 44:31)
them it's like like the heart gold's (44:29 - 44:32)
soul's over what is it it's like after (44:31 - 44:35)
jasmine or something you don't get it (44:32 - 44:37)
so that you can do all that great kanto (44:35 - 44:40)
yeah and on top of that they're like hey (44:37 - 44:42)
dude in the little town hall uh you (44:40 - 44:45)
didn't catch 40 pokemon no experience (44:42 - 44:47)
here for you if you want to grind (44:45 - 44:49)
properly you gotta grind like (44:47 - 44:52)
that that should be the actual outrage (44:49 - 44:54)
um i i don't know i think it's fine (44:52 - 44:57)
i i feel like it's just (44:54 - 44:59)
people complaining for the sake of (44:57 - 45:01)
complaining because hello welcome to (44:59 - 45:04)
2021 welcome to the internet (45:01 - 45:08)
because like there is still control (45:04 - 45:10)
but it's not the control that they want (45:08 - 45:12)
it's not the control it's not the look a (45:10 - 45:14)
bunch of they want the boomer control (45:12 - 45:15)
back they want that little toggle switch (45:14 - 45:18)
we got more advanced zoomer control (45:15 - 45:20)
where we can do all these things over (45:18 - 45:22)
here i mean i don't think it's more (45:20 - 45:23)
advanced if you took away the toggle (45:22 - 45:27)
switch you made it less advanced like (45:23 - 45:27)
we took away features so it's more (45:28 - 45:32)
advanced (45:30 - 45:34)
they took they took it away but they did (45:32 - 45:36)
replace it with something and look if (45:34 - 45:40)
that if that was the that was the call (45:36 - 45:43)
i'll take pc anywhere anytime (45:40 - 45:47)
oh that's that's the better thing i i (45:43 - 45:49)
mean (45:47 - 45:49)
i don't get why they i still don't (45:49 - 45:53)
fundamentally understand the thought (45:51 - 45:55)
process behind getting rid of the toggle (45:53 - 45:59)
but i don't have to it's just like why (45:55 - 46:01)
yeah (45:59 - 46:02)
yeah i mean they could have both right (46:01 - 46:03)
right (46:02 - 46:05)
and they had both (46:03 - 46:08)
and then they just didn't my only guess (46:05 - 46:10)
is (46:08 - 46:10)
they still want people to finish the (46:11 - 46:15)
game (46:13 - 46:17)
and so if you give that person the (46:15 - 46:18)
option to turn it off and then they get (46:17 - 46:20)
frustrated it's it's the whole shiny (46:18 - 46:21)
lock thing (46:20 - 46:24)
if you if you don't (46:21 - 46:27)
if if if they didn't shiny lock zekram (46:24 - 46:28)
and (46:27 - 46:30)
and then people would sit there (46:28 - 46:32)
which i which there's two arguments of (46:30 - 46:34)
that it's like people will sit there and (46:32 - 46:35)
then they don't see the end of the game (46:34 - 46:36)
and (46:35 - 46:37)
as a (46:36 - 46:39)
creator of a product you want somebody (46:37 - 46:40)
to go through your entire product and (46:39 - 46:43)
consume it the way you envisioned it (46:40 - 46:45)
so i see that point of like i want you (46:43 - 46:47)
to go through this the way (46:45 - 46:49)
i designed you to go through this and (46:47 - 46:50)
then there's the other point of like who (46:49 - 46:52)
get who cares they spent the 40 let them (46:50 - 46:53)
do what they want (46:52 - 46:54)
i (46:53 - 46:55)
like (46:54 - 46:56)
that applies to a lot of things like (46:55 - 46:58)
customization we want you to play this (46:56 - 47:00)
character and only this character so (46:58 - 47:02)
there's no customization like (47:00 - 47:05)
it it is a weird mindset to be like we (47:02 - 47:07)
want you to play it this way and see the (47:05 - 47:10)
end of the game our way it is a it is a (47:07 - 47:11)
strange thing to latch onto because that (47:10 - 47:14)
can apply for a lot of things we only (47:11 - 47:16)
want this character design so you can't (47:14 - 47:19)
customize it yeah we only want these (47:16 - 47:21)
pokemon to be available so (47:19 - 47:24)
that's it like (47:21 - 47:24)
i don't see the benefit of not having (47:25 - 47:30)
the toggle (47:28 - 47:32)
it's not a deal breaker i don't really (47:30 - 47:33)
care it's just one of the it's one of (47:32 - 47:35)
the design choices that i would love to (47:33 - 47:38)
have been there for to hear the reason (47:35 - 47:39)
why (47:38 - 47:42)
why did you take away this functionality (47:39 - 47:43)
what (47:42 - 47:48)
what improvement in the game did you see (47:43 - 47:50)
by taking it away (47:48 - 47:52)
unless they held like focus groups and i (47:50 - 47:55)
mean yeah and i'm curious pokemon i mean (47:52 - 47:57)
i'm curious what (47:55 - 47:58)
what brought about the decision like i (47:57 - 48:01)
would love to know the reasons why (47:58 - 48:03)
behind these things are because i always (48:01 - 48:06)
feel like a lot of people are (48:03 - 48:07)
i mean this is the niantic thing you get (48:06 - 48:09)
upset at the thing because they don't (48:07 - 48:10)
tell you (48:09 - 48:12)
why they made the decision just that (48:10 - 48:13)
they (48:12 - 48:15)
made the decision like everybody got mad (48:13 - 48:17)
at their parents when they said no (48:15 - 48:18)
because i told you so (48:17 - 48:20)
this is sort of the same thing it's like (48:18 - 48:21)
you're not (48:20 - 48:23)
telling us the reasons (48:21 - 48:24)
why you don't make sense of these (48:23 - 48:26)
decisions and so it's going to rub (48:24 - 48:28)
people the wrong way why (48:26 - 48:31)
they put the audio settings on a random (48:28 - 48:34)
npc two gyms in like what (48:31 - 48:37)
not two gyms in but two cities in yeah i (48:34 - 48:39)
mean they just make weird decisions and (48:37 - 48:39)
they (48:39 - 48:41)
you feel like you're in a real world (48:39 - 48:44)
it's not like i can just (48:41 - 48:47)
tap my window and change the (48:44 - 48:50)
brightness it's called drapes you got (48:47 - 48:52)
well i got to go two towns over to get (48:50 - 48:54)
them to get drapes i have to drive to (48:52 - 48:56)
target two towns over to finally find (48:54 - 48:59)
drapes they don't have drapes at target (48:56 - 49:01)
yeah they do not my target off game (48:59 - 49:03)
informer it says a big question is (49:01 - 49:05)
whether these uh is is whether the remix (49:03 - 49:08)
will have hidden machines hms uh since (49:05 - 49:10)
they were cut from the variety of modern (49:08 - 49:12)
pokemon games this time around gym (49:10 - 49:14)
badges will unlock hm moves that can be (49:12 - 49:16)
used around the world you do not have to (49:14 - 49:19)
teach them to your pokemon using an hm (49:16 - 49:21)
like strength will move a boulder uh (49:19 - 49:23)
using an hm (49:21 - 49:24)
like strength to move a boulder will (49:23 - 49:26)
make a wild pokemon appear and use the (49:24 - 49:28)
move for you it doesn't really make any (49:26 - 49:30)
sense but i'll take the convenience over (49:28 - 49:32)
wasting precious move slots (49:30 - 49:34)
uh so (49:32 - 49:37)
we knew the hm thing we knew the yeah (49:34 - 49:38)
but (49:37 - 49:40)
the they unlocked through badges is i (49:38 - 49:42)
that made sense i guess but it's nice to (49:40 - 49:43)
just (49:42 - 49:46)
hear it written down (49:43 - 49:46)
uh (49:46 - 49:49)
you can call on these uh helpful and (49:47 - 49:51)
wild monsters using the new improved (49:49 - 49:54)
pokey po tech pokemon (49:51 - 49:55)
poke (49:54 - 49:57)
the watch like device from diamond and (49:55 - 50:00)
pearl apps on this new poke will include (49:57 - 50:02)
a step counter pokemon friend checker (50:00 - 50:05)
calculator item dowsing machine drawing (50:02 - 50:07)
pad so just confirming that those things (50:05 - 50:09)
are back (50:07 - 50:09)
they john writes my favorite part of the (50:10 - 50:13)
demo was when we ventured into the (50:12 - 50:15)
ground underground a massive (50:13 - 50:16)
subterrarian map that compares in the (50:15 - 50:18)
size of the above ground of sinnoh down (50:16 - 50:20)
in these depths the trainers can uh (50:18 - 50:24)
excavate the excavation escalate there (50:20 - 50:26)
we go items (50:24 - 50:27)
you can find some pokemon statues (50:26 - 50:29)
decorate your secret bases these secret (50:27 - 50:31)
bases are special customizable rooms (50:29 - 50:32)
found in the ground underground (50:31 - 50:34)
depending on (50:32 - 50:35)
which pokemon figures you decorate it (50:34 - 50:37)
will affect which pokemon you can find (50:35 - 50:39)
and catch in the larger underground (50:37 - 50:42)
called hideaways use certain bug statues (50:39 - 50:43)
you will more likely find bug in the (50:42 - 50:45)
hideaway a device in front of your (50:43 - 50:47)
secret base will let you know how the (50:45 - 50:50)
hideaways will be affected a statue (50:47 - 50:52)
statue collection is a big part of the (50:50 - 50:53)
ground underground experience and your (50:52 - 50:56)
overall pokemon collecting strategy some (50:53 - 50:59)
statues even come in a rare shiny (50:56 - 51:00)
version (50:59 - 51:02)
that gives a different effect from their (51:00 - 51:04)
standard counterpart well now they've (51:02 - 51:06)
added five more years to steve's twitch (51:04 - 51:08)
no (51:06 - 51:10)
um tiny statues (51:08 - 51:13)
which i think was what kind of hinted at (51:10 - 51:14)
when we were like why is this statue (51:13 - 51:19)
green and why is the statue like um yeah (51:14 - 51:19)
so yeah i mean i i think if you want a (51:20 - 51:24)
little bit more out of the ch (51:21 - 51:26)
out of this like preview (51:24 - 51:27)

whatnot hey speaking of misinformation (52:32 - 52:36)
just because we can't have a 90 minute (52:36 - 52:39)
episode this week and i'm super sorry (52:37 - 52:41)
for that uh speaking of this information (52:39 - 52:42)
though we'll probably cover this on my (52:41 - 52:45)
twitch stream on monday night if you if (52:42 - 52:46)
people want to come by and get the (52:45 - 52:48)
details here i'll give you the too long (52:46 - 52:49)
didn't read though (52:48 - 52:52)
back when sword and shield came out (52:49 - 52:55)
no one knew the shiny odds (52:52 - 52:56)
and (52:55 - 52:59)
for like a week sarah b just kept (52:56 - 53:01)
changing what that was (52:59 - 53:04)
and it was normal i think most people (53:01 - 53:06)
were like yep this is gonna be different (53:04 - 53:08)
and then (53:06 - 53:10)
and then um (53:08 - 53:13)
pokemon.com put out (53:10 - 53:14)
shiny hunting because they're like this (53:13 - 53:16)
is how you shiny hunt (53:14 - 53:19)
and it it hardly it very much conflicted (53:16 - 53:22)
with what cerebri said now serbia is not (53:19 - 53:24)
a data miner joe over at cereby they (53:22 - 53:26)
work with the data miners and they (53:24 - 53:29)
figure all that out and (53:26 - 53:30)
this is (53:29 - 53:32)
like it took what three weeks for let's (53:30 - 53:33)
go to be (53:32 - 53:35)
pretty much figured out and solidified (53:33 - 53:38)
shiny stuff i think for omega ruby alpha (53:35 - 53:40)
sapphire it took over a year for people (53:38 - 53:41)
to figure out (53:40 - 53:45)
uh dexnav and how dexnav worked (53:41 - 53:46)
um (53:45 - 53:48)
sos took (53:46 - 53:51)
uh like two weeks i think (53:48 - 53:53)
this is not unheard of but it has been (53:51 - 53:55)
almost two (53:53 - 53:58)
years and for some reason for (53:55 - 54:00)
the data miners decided to go back and (53:58 - 54:02)
look at the shiny odds (54:00 - 54:04)
and they have verified that serebii has (54:02 - 54:06)
been wrong for two years and the (54:04 - 54:10)
pokemon.com article has been right the (54:06 - 54:13)
entire time (54:10 - 54:13)
yet (54:14 - 54:17)
and that is (54:16 - 54:20)
what i have always said thank you to the (54:17 - 54:23)
people that like (54:20 - 54:25)
i i have never said that (54:23 - 54:28)
i've i i just found it really weird that (54:25 - 54:30)
pokemon.com would actually go to the (54:28 - 54:33)
efforts to put out a shiny article (54:30 - 54:34)
because they rarely do they they started (54:33 - 54:36)
kind of doing that around like sun and (54:34 - 54:37)
moon (54:36 - 54:40)
they went to the efforts to put it out (54:37 - 54:43)
why would they put it out wrong (54:40 - 54:43)
i don't know so (54:45 - 54:49)
there's there's a lot more to it what (54:47 - 54:52)
was sarah be saying that was wrong it's (54:49 - 54:52)
pretty much (54:52 - 54:55)
pretty much the the too long didn't read (54:52 - 54:57)
of that is brilliant pokemon are (54:55 - 54:59)
increased shinies (54:57 - 55:01)
oh (54:59 - 55:02)
um (55:01 - 55:04)
and by by (55:02 - 55:06)
knocking out you're increasing your (55:04 - 55:08)
brilliant which is increasing your (55:06 - 55:10)
chance for shinies uh what's a brilliant (55:08 - 55:13)
pokemon it's the one with the aura yeah (55:10 - 55:16)
oh the ones that the pokemons (55:13 - 55:18)
yeah the ones that give you watts okay (55:16 - 55:20)
so i'm gonna well well it's it was a (55:18 - 55:21)
data miner they had like (55:20 - 55:23)
it was like 30 tweets in a row i'll go (55:21 - 55:24)
through all that on my twitch stream and (55:23 - 55:26)
then probably just make it into a video (55:24 - 55:27)
and stuff (55:26 - 55:29)
tldr because you're gonna do an (55:27 - 55:32)
instagram a tick tock uh (55:29 - 55:36)
instagram reel i'm sure youtube vid (55:32 - 55:39)
am i wasting my time going to honeycomb (55:36 - 55:43)
see every freaking day and knocking out (55:39 - 55:45)
ten combis or is that what you're (55:43 - 55:47)
telling me where i wanna go that's (55:45 - 55:47)
getting you where you want to go what (55:47 - 55:50)
you are doing is correct okay (55:47 - 55:53)
what you what you are doing is correct (55:50 - 55:55)
it's not (55:53 - 55:57)
like me saying that it's not like well (55:55 - 55:59)
joe was wrong for two years it's just (55:57 - 56:00)
like (55:59 - 56:02)
it's a little frustrating to be like (56:00 - 56:05)
okay why didn't we look more into this (56:02 - 56:08)
like why were we just like (56:05 - 56:10)
pokemon.com is wrong this is right (56:08 - 56:12)
everyone's okay (56:10 - 56:14)
um (56:12 - 56:15)
i i don't know (56:14 - 56:17)
it's because ultimately it doesn't (56:15 - 56:19)
matter and people don't really pay (56:17 - 56:21)
attention to that you're right (56:19 - 56:22)
ultimately it doesn't matter because (56:21 - 56:25)
like even if it whether it's one in four (56:22 - 56:27)
thousand one in thirteen hundred one in (56:25 - 56:29)
eight thousand one still random you're (56:27 - 56:31)
still going to just do the same thing (56:29 - 56:34)
anyways and confirmation bias is going (56:31 - 56:37)
to allow you to to align with whichever (56:34 - 56:40)
one you pay attention to so (56:37 - 56:42)
joe being wrong for two years (56:40 - 56:44)
everybody's like no no that's exactly (56:42 - 56:46)
what happened to me because that's what (56:44 - 56:47)
they had in their brain and that matched (56:46 - 56:50)
up with the pattern (56:47 - 56:52)
ultimately shiny odds (56:50 - 56:53)
because it's still (56:52 - 56:56)
every chance is flipping a coin you (56:53 - 56:59)
unless you have a giant spreadsheet (56:56 - 57:01)
you're never going to (56:59 - 57:04)
actually like remember oh i got this one (57:01 - 57:06)
in four thousand but then this one i got (57:04 - 57:06)
greg (57:06 - 57:09)
sad thing is that a lot of these people (57:06 - 57:11)
who shiny hunt do keep count (57:09 - 57:13)
i mean because so many people ask me (57:11 - 57:15)
it's like how many combies have you gone (57:13 - 57:17)
through i'm like i know (57:15 - 57:19)
i got a lot a lot of these people that (57:17 - 57:21)
shiny hunt also they look at this stuff (57:19 - 57:24)
and i know just some shiny hunters that (57:21 - 57:25)
were very hardcore and they're like well (57:24 - 57:27)
shiny hunting's (57:25 - 57:28)
no fun in sword and shield because it's (57:27 - 57:30)
broken (57:28 - 57:31)
and it's like but it it's it's not (57:30 - 57:33)
broken it's just (57:31 - 57:36)
it's different and we didn't understand (57:33 - 57:38)
exactly how it was until now (57:36 - 57:40)
but if you were to look at syraby's (57:38 - 57:44)
numbers which seems like oh i only knock (57:40 - 57:46)
out five thousand i knock out 500 (57:44 - 57:47)
pokemon and it only works three percent (57:46 - 57:49)
of the time and that's not worth it and (57:47 - 57:50)
it's still (57:49 - 57:52)
that was wrong and but those people (57:50 - 57:54)
looked at it and was like oh this is (57:52 - 57:57)
broken they made it unfun why even do it (57:54 - 58:01)
i'm going to go to another game (57:57 - 58:01)
i get it it's like a little discouraging (58:01 - 58:06)
to be like oh this is a bad way to hunt (58:03 - 58:07)
but then it's like they go back to like (58:06 - 58:08)
crystal and they're like one in eight (58:07 - 58:10)
thousand and you're like yeah i guess (58:08 - 58:12)
yeah i'm gonna go to shiny i'm gonna go (58:10 - 58:13)
to a worse odds because i know it's (58:12 - 58:17)
worse odds yeah (58:13 - 58:19)
spinning around on a bike trying to get (58:17 - 58:22)
a shiny solosis (58:19 - 58:22)
okay but (58:22 - 58:25)
speed past it (58:25 - 58:29)

robert writes in and said (59:45 - 59:49)
boy i got a lot of thoughts about this (59:48 - 59:51)
question when did mythicals become less (59:49 - 59:53)
memorable never (59:51 - 59:55)
never i don't think they have been what (59:53 - 59:57)
does less memorable mean (59:55 - 59:58)
i think people (59:57 - 60:01)
i would assume (59:58 - 60:01)
oh no i can tell you exactly where (60:02 - 60:07)
marshado (60:05 - 60:08)
no i don't (60:07 - 60:11)
because i you know who even (60:08 - 60:13)
thinks of (60:11 - 60:16)
rabbit guy as well (60:13 - 60:18)
rabbit guys exactly (60:16 - 60:20)
no (60:18 - 60:23)
crown tundra (60:20 - 60:25)
he's not a bit oh calorics he's not a (60:23 - 60:29)
medical he's legendary oh good lord (60:25 - 60:31)
then who's the mythical for for sword (60:29 - 60:33)
and shield (60:31 - 60:35)
here's the thing that ruined it (60:33 - 60:38)
mythical for sword and shield yeah (60:35 - 60:43)
mel metal and well not met well (60:38 - 60:43)
yeah whatever (60:43 - 60:47)
when they started releasing the (60:46 - 60:49)
mythicals five years after the game came (60:47 - 60:52)
out and you forgot (60:49 - 60:52)
okay wait mcgiron is from alola wait (60:53 - 60:57)
what (60:56 - 60:59)
you're no okay i think vanguard is fine (60:57 - 61:01)
too okay (60:59 - 61:03)
they're fine they're just forgettable (61:01 - 61:04)
they're no mews they're not they're no (61:03 - 61:06)
selling not forgettable they're not your (61:04 - 61:09)
ratchet (61:06 - 61:09)
what (61:09 - 61:11)
okay i (61:09 - 61:13)
here's the thing that ruined mythicals (61:11 - 61:15)
for people and people will i will give (61:13 - 61:17)
you the mythical that ruined mythicals (61:15 - 61:19)
for people but they're they're ignoring (61:17 - 61:21)
everything else that pokemon is victini (61:19 - 61:22)
no (61:21 - 61:23)
no (61:22 - 61:26)
slander get out your mouth (61:23 - 61:28)
and this is all your guys's fault (61:26 - 61:30)
everyone who listens to this podcast all (61:28 - 61:33)
these pokemon fans on twitter this is (61:30 - 61:34)
all of your guys's fault (61:33 - 61:38)
they put extra effort into victini they (61:34 - 61:41)
gave victini his own island i know (61:38 - 61:43)
when you bought the game you didn't have (61:41 - 61:45)
to go anywhere else you walked into (61:43 - 61:47)
gamestop you got the game they handed (61:45 - 61:50)
you a code card you went back to (61:47 - 61:52)
chipotle in mall of america you sat down (61:50 - 61:54)
you entered the code card under mystery (61:52 - 61:56)
gift and then when you got to that i (61:54 - 61:58)
when you got to castellia city you could (61:56 - 62:01)
take the boat over to get victini they (61:58 - 62:03)
put so much effort into that it was and (62:01 - 62:05)
they did not do it before and they did (62:03 - 62:08)
not do it after and you know why (62:05 - 62:09)
because all these pokemon fans (62:08 - 62:12)
complained that gen 5 was bad gen 5 had (62:09 - 62:14)
so much hate compared to sword and (62:12 - 62:15)
shield and all these other games why (62:14 - 62:17)
would they do it again (62:15 - 62:19)
and to and if you want to say mythicals (62:17 - 62:22)
before then mew all you had to do was go (62:19 - 62:24)
to toys r us there was nothing special (62:22 - 62:26)
about that you had to go to toys r us (62:24 - 62:28)
you had to talk to some employee getting (62:26 - 62:32)
paid 7 25 an hour with uh high waisted (62:28 - 62:35)
pants hating their life because they're (62:32 - 62:37)
interacting with 12 year olds and (62:35 - 62:38)
parents that are probably very (62:37 - 62:41)
pretentious about their children (62:38 - 62:43)
if you wanted (62:41 - 62:44)
jirachi (62:43 - 62:47)
you got to buy a bad genius sonority (62:44 - 62:49)
game on the gamecube in order to get (62:47 - 62:50)
jirachi or go to your friend's house to (62:49 - 62:52)
trade it like let's not pretend that (62:50 - 62:54)
they were that special there was nothing (62:52 - 62:56)
special about buying a fifty dollar bad (62:54 - 62:58)
game for the nintendo gamecube to get it (62:56 - 62:59)
directly about special it's about (62:58 - 63:01)
memorable and you've already now (62:59 - 63:02)
answered the question (63:01 - 63:06)
with the actual answer the problem is (63:02 - 63:08)
you no longer if there's it's two parts (63:06 - 63:10)
number one you no longer have to go (63:08 - 63:13)
anywhere to get a mythical i got zeroed (63:10 - 63:16)
in my email inbox right now (63:13 - 63:18)
right i don't have to do any i don't (63:16 - 63:20)
have to put any effort (63:18 - 63:22)
i don't have to talk to the creepy (63:20 - 63:23)
shop (63:22 - 63:25)
but no not that's not special they're (63:23 - 63:27)
not i think they're all memorable but (63:25 - 63:28)
then i think they're all memorable (63:27 - 63:31)
they're they're talking about like (63:28 - 63:34)
i have the experience of going to this (63:31 - 63:38)
place and hooking my game boy to the guy (63:34 - 63:41)
at toys r us game boy and he transferred (63:38 - 63:43)
the mew like i had that experience so (63:41 - 63:46)
that's number one but the answer is the (63:43 - 63:47)
answer to the question (63:46 - 63:52)
is they do so many distributions now (63:47 - 63:55)
that any distribution is not (63:52 - 63:58)
exciting it's like (63:55 - 63:59)
there's something everywhere there's (63:58 - 64:03)
some code this poke pkm cast on (63:59 - 64:05)
instagram is like here's the code of the (64:03 - 64:07)
month get get this crappy pokemon that (64:05 - 64:10)
they're spitting out for free mythicals (64:07 - 64:11)
became (64:10 - 64:12)
less memorable (64:11 - 64:16)
when you became an adult (64:12 - 64:16)
mythicals have been the same since toys (64:16 - 64:22)
r us they've been the same since day one (64:19 - 64:25)
m for mythical m for marketing that is (64:22 - 64:29)
of they have always been a marketing (64:25 - 64:31)
tool to get you to buy (64:29 - 64:34)
ranger to get you to buy coliseum to get (64:31 - 64:36)
you through the door and gamestop to get (64:34 - 64:38)
you to sign up for a newsletter to (64:36 - 64:40)
convince you to play pokemon go to (64:38 - 64:43)
convince you to go to toys r us they (64:40 - 64:46)
have literally only been if you (64:43 - 64:49)
if you have not realized this in 25 (64:46 - 64:51)
years that they have been a marketing (64:49 - 64:55)
tool zarood is for you to be like i got (64:51 - 64:57)
this a rude huh maybe i should check out (64:55 - 64:59)
that movie on netflix (64:57 - 65:01)
when you became an adult and realized it (64:59 - 65:03)
was all marketing is when they became (65:01 - 65:06)
less memorable that is the actual (65:03 - 65:08)
difference between mythical pokemon and (65:06 - 65:10)
legendary pokemon legendary pokemon are (65:08 - 65:12)
the things at the end of the game that (65:10 - 65:14)
you're supposed to chase mythical (65:12 - 65:16)
pokemon are marketing materials (65:14 - 65:19)
m for marketing (65:16 - 65:22)

hmu is worthless yeah but it could still (66:01 - 66:05)
be your fate they're not that there's (66:04 - 66:08)
it's just your favorite i so i would say (66:05 - 66:10)
my top three (66:08 - 66:12)
and it's like really focused on the deck (66:10 - 66:14)
that i played the most uh darkrai is up (66:12 - 66:15)
there (66:14 - 66:17)
hydrogen is up there and then of course (66:15 - 66:19)
you had to have sableye and you had to (66:17 - 66:21)
have the good sableye (66:19 - 66:22)
you're talking about jungkook's this (66:21 - 66:25)
junk hunt say black yeah (66:22 - 66:29)
i think junk hunt sableye (66:25 - 66:32)
has got to be my favorite tcg card oh (66:29 - 66:34)
somebody gave greg some roselias because (66:32 - 66:36)
i like the art in both of these those (66:34 - 66:38)
are cute (66:36 - 66:39)
i would say (66:38 - 66:41)
i don't like the yard in this one (66:39 - 66:43)
yeah that one's not good i do i remember (66:41 - 66:44)
that card (66:43 - 66:47)
i will say i have this (66:44 - 66:50)
uh hollow flashy rose raid that i like (66:47 - 66:52)
ooh that one's good (66:50 - 66:54)
uh tropical beach is probably one of my (66:52 - 66:55)
most memorable favorite cards but it's (66:54 - 66:57)
the trainer so that feels weird but i (66:55 - 66:58)
love tropical beach (66:57 - 67:01)
mine is very similar to will's it was (66:58 - 67:04)
darkrai gx or was it the darkrai ex it (67:01 - 67:06)
was from the dark explorers darkrai and (67:04 - 67:08)
its ability was the as long as it had a (67:06 - 67:11)
dark type energy you have free retreat (67:08 - 67:12)
um (67:11 - 67:14)
and it was darkrai was part of the (67:12 - 67:16)
mewtwo wars (67:14 - 67:17)
in the (67:16 - 67:19)
black and white era which is part of the (67:17 - 67:21)
celebrations uh the mewtwo with the i (67:19 - 67:23)
think it's xball it's like a double (67:21 - 67:25)
colorless so you would play a double (67:23 - 67:27)
colorless it would do 40 but it would do (67:25 - 67:28)
80 against another mewtwo but they would (67:27 - 67:31)
play it and (67:28 - 67:33)
so it was it was the dark cry there (67:31 - 67:36)
um is this the junk hunt sable eye (67:33 - 67:38)
does it have junk hunt on it yes it has (67:36 - 67:40)
junk this artwork is incredible yes (67:38 - 67:41)
isn't it and it's a great it is (67:40 - 67:43)
incredible because junk hunt should be (67:41 - 67:45)
free right there's no energy cost for (67:43 - 67:47)
junk hunt i don't know it's got a dark (67:45 - 67:49)
thing next to it no one dark energy (67:47 - 67:50)
no is it a dark energy i thought it was (67:49 - 67:51)
free (67:50 - 67:52)
nah (67:51 - 67:54)
look i don't know what that is one dark (67:52 - 67:56)
energy wonder oh yeah it is a dark (67:54 - 67:57)
energy yeah yeah because you you get (67:56 - 67:59)
there are there are some pokemon cards (67:57 - 68:00)
that have like a free move and it's (67:59 - 68:02)
usually like an empty circle those are (68:00 - 68:04)
the only that's free those are actually (68:02 - 68:06)
i think i have some ancient pokemon (68:04 - 68:08)
cards in my basement (68:06 - 68:10)
from like when it was first released (68:08 - 68:12)
i haven't looked i haven't looked for (68:10 - 68:15)
them so my favorite meme tcg card and (68:12 - 68:16)
now i you have to forgive me because i (68:15 - 68:19)
can't remember if it was palkia or (68:16 - 68:23)
dialga but it's basically it was one (68:19 - 68:25)
where (68:23 - 68:26)
it would like attack and then (68:25 - 68:28)
immediately go back to the bench after (68:26 - 68:31)
it was done attacking and then (68:28 - 68:33)
no no no no no no kel deal was rush in (68:31 - 68:35)
oh yeah kelly was rushing yeah yeah this (68:33 - 68:37)
was it would attack and immediately go (68:35 - 68:39)
back to the bench and then there was (68:37 - 68:41)
another card that was playable at the (68:39 - 68:43)
time that was like could not take (68:41 - 68:46)
attacks from pokemon gx (68:43 - 68:50)
which like everybody had gx was like (68:46 - 68:52)
usually there was a hoopa that happens (68:50 - 68:55)
this is way way way before hoopa um (68:52 - 68:57)
so it was just like you would attack (68:55 - 68:59)
with palkia put it back to the bench and (68:57 - 69:02)
then the other one would come up yeah (68:59 - 69:04)
and then they couldn't (69:02 - 69:05)
they couldn't attack it (69:04 - 69:07)
and then you just like (69:05 - 69:10)
you keep swapping palki or dialga in it (69:07 - 69:13)
it's like so me me and stupid but i love (69:10 - 69:16)
it there was an assault a selgor card (69:13 - 69:17)
that did the same thing and that's (69:16 - 69:19)
attack i think was called deck and cover (69:17 - 69:21)
and then for two double colorless it (69:19 - 69:23)
would well no no no then it would go (69:21 - 69:25)
back it would go back into the deck the (69:23 - 69:26)
deck yeah yeah yeah and then but then (69:25 - 69:28)
you could use mu (69:26 - 69:31)
and you could copy that move yes so you (69:28 - 69:32)
could do the same thing you'd use (69:31 - 69:35)
gardevoir to thin your deck out but make (69:32 - 69:37)
sure that you didn't deck out so yeah (69:35 - 69:40)
cover was a good deck yeah but uh (69:37 - 69:42)
there needed a lot of pieces new to (69:40 - 69:44)
tropical beach so (69:42 - 69:47)
i love the tropical beach (69:44 - 69:47)
i do like the keldeo with russian calder (69:47 - 69:51)
russian was was very memorable too (69:49 - 69:53)
blastoise keldeo yeah (69:51 - 69:55)
yeah (69:53 - 69:56)
those were the good old days (69:55 - 69:58)
after matalia cards over here i could (69:56 - 70:01)
show again that's that's not not going (69:58 - 70:03)
to win you any games but what is our (70:01 - 70:06)
pokemon of the week (70:03 - 70:09)
well i screwed up (70:06 - 70:11)
i don't remember the last one (70:09 - 70:15)
so the last one i gave you five (70:11 - 70:17)
irrelevant i gotta i gotta open it up (70:15 - 70:19)
again (70:17 - 70:23)
uh five non-relevant facts one was about (70:19 - 70:25)
going to the gym one was about the (70:23 - 70:28)
jetsons one was about the roman god (70:25 - 70:30)
janus one was about a german word that (70:28 - 70:31)
was probably the most important of the (70:30 - 70:34)
clues that people ignored (70:31 - 70:36)
uh and then one was about reciprocating (70:34 - 70:38)
motion (70:36 - 70:38)
all right so if number one means that (70:39 - 70:44)
it's only a steel type so mono steel (70:41 - 70:46)
type number two references (70:44 - 70:48)
sprockets and cogs (70:46 - 70:50)
oh i remember that number three (70:48 - 70:53)
references something that has two faces (70:50 - 70:56)
number four i'm not going to tell you (70:53 - 70:58)
and number five is a (70:56 - 71:00)
method of using (70:58 - 71:03)
two sprockets together so that you would (71:00 - 71:05)
transform motion that goes up and down (71:03 - 71:08)
or in and out into rotational motion (71:05 - 71:13)
what then would you say (71:08 - 71:13)
cling clang (71:15 - 71:20)
[Music] (71:17 - 71:22)
craig you got to guess something clang (71:20 - 71:24)
greg is correct because (71:22 - 71:27)
there's no word in german that is cling (71:24 - 71:28)
clang (71:27 - 71:33)
there is a word in german that is clong (71:28 - 71:33)
tone musical tone note or timbre (71:36 - 71:41)
yeah greg hates uh mechanical pokemon i (71:39 - 71:43)
do (71:41 - 71:44)
i mean that doesn't mean he can't get (71:43 - 71:47)
the answer right (71:44 - 71:47)
i know (71:47 - 71:49)
guy what (71:48 - 71:52)
i like cling cling i like that line (71:49 - 71:54)
i do too you find him in charge (71:52 - 71:56)
stone cavern along with all the (71:54 - 71:58)
dynamos some of the best pokemon (71:56 - 72:01)

pokemon from generation five to make its (72:03 - 72:09)
debut in a main series (72:06 - 72:11)
what does that mean oh what i see what (72:09 - 72:12)
they're saying they're saying when (72:11 - 72:16)
you're going through the world (72:12 - 72:18)
clang is the last pokemon that's like a (72:16 - 72:20)
new pokemon that you can encounter in (72:18 - 72:22)
the wild (72:20 - 72:26)
in generation five how is that possible (72:22 - 72:28)
i don't think you even see buffalo until (72:26 - 72:30)
you're on victory road yeah or near (72:28 - 72:32)
victory road because you've already seen (72:30 - 72:33)
