streets yeah what kind of house is this (1:15 - 1:23)
Motorhome it's a long house that (1:19 - 1:24)

Motorhome no no no alright a trailer (1:24 - 1:29)
okay (1:29 - 1:32)
we're already off course you got a (1:29 - 1:35)
special episode for you guys so I'll (1:32 - 1:36)
just break it down there's gonna be no (1:35 - 1:39)
news no Pokemon the week and we're just (1:36 - 1:41)
gonna talk about Pokemon go fest so I (1:39 - 1:42)
don't know how long we're going to talk (1:41 - 1:43)
about that but that's gonna be the whole (1:42 - 1:46)
episode we're all it is the morning (1:43 - 1:49)
after Pokemon go fest Irene is still in (1:46 - 1:52)
her pajamas will is still in now this is (1:49 - 1:55)
literally the clothes I'm wearing okay (1:52 - 1:55)
we're gonna talk about Pokemon go fast (2:01 - 2:05)
if you didn't go to Pokemon go fast if (2:03 - 2:08)
you don't care about Pokemon go I would (2:05 - 2:10)
advise you not to turn off this episode (2:08 - 2:12)
do not change to another channel oh they (2:10 - 2:18)
will assuredly be entertained yeah even (2:12 - 2:20)
if you don't care even if you're not the (2:18 - 2:22)
biggest Pokemon go player I think it's a (2:20 - 2:23)
point important to note that this is (2:22 - 2:27)
still a Pokemon event that was clearly (2:23 - 2:28)
the Pokemon company is very involved in (2:27 - 2:30)
Pokemon go and they care about its (2:28 - 2:32)
success and how it does and how it (2:30 - 2:34)
reflects or that company (2:32 - 2:37)
this was kind of pokemons summer thing (2:34 - 2:38)
and I believe they're not talking about (2:37 - 2:40)
ultrasound and ultramoon because of all (2:38 - 2:43)
the pokemon ghost stuff and then now (2:40 - 2:44)
that this is dying down we will get (2:43 - 2:46)
ultrasound and all from and stuff but (2:44 - 2:48)
this is still important for Pokemon as a (2:46 - 2:49)
whole so I think it's important to talk (2:48 - 2:52)
about with that being said I have a (2:49 - 2:54)
bunch of tweets that I barely remember (2:52 - 2:56)
the day yesterday but I'm looking at the (2:54 - 2:59)
tweets and now I do remember myself and (2:56 - 3:02)
Irene went Myka and your wife went (2:59 - 3:04)
correct my mother was there who's (3:02 - 3:07)
probably spent more time with you and (3:04 - 3:14)
Becky yes we used the patreon money to (3:07 - 3:18)
fly will out so will was was here he (3:14 - 3:20)
arrived and I'm still here second time (3:18 - 3:21)
in Chicago (3:20 - 3:24)
ah that was yes my second time in (3:21 - 3:29)
Chicago was it better than the first hmm (3:24 - 3:31)
I don't want to ruin it for people I'm (3:29 - 3:36)
not gonna say hi I guess I guess I'll (3:31 - 3:38)
start because I I read and I got there (3:36 - 3:41)
before everyone else so truly we would (3:38 - 3:45)
no no no no I I mean in Chicago I was (3:41 - 3:47)
there at 7 a.m. yeah but you weren't at (3:45 - 3:49)
the event you were off getting breakfast (3:47 - 3:51)
that's true that's true okay okay well (3:49 - 3:54)
actually before before we start we'll (3:51 - 3:55)
start with Myka what was he (3:54 - 3:58)
what was your expectations of this event (3:55 - 4:05)
on the way down so my wife Becky plays (3:58 - 4:07)
Pokemon go with me but she plays it with (4:05 - 4:11)
me as a means to do something with me (4:07 - 4:15)
wala did she does any time yes she won't (4:11 - 4:19)
typically play on her own unless she's (4:15 - 4:22)
playing with me the only time she's ever (4:19 - 4:23)
gone out and played pokemon go on her (4:22 - 4:26)
own was the day before pokemon go fest (4:23 - 4:29)
when she wanted to get to level 20 just (4:26 - 4:31)
as like a milestone so she went out (4:29 - 4:34)
walked the dog all over and tried to (4:31 - 4:36)
solo a four star raid because she didn't (4:34 - 4:40)
know how raids worked perfect she kind (4:36 - 4:42)
of came because she wanted to see (4:40 - 4:45)
everybody she wanted to spend time with (4:42 - 4:47)
me and on the way (4:45 - 4:51)
down in the car I was thanking her and I (4:47 - 4:53)
said I'm very grateful that you're (4:51 - 4:54)
coming even though I know this is (4:53 - 4:56)
something you typically wouldn't want to (4:54 - 4:59)
do I'm really excited for this and I'm (4:56 - 5:02)
happy that you're gonna be there and I'm (4:59 - 5:03)
happy you get to meet everybody from the (5:02 - 5:05)
pod kit you know like yeah yeah like the (5:03 - 5:07)
community and stuff that'll be there and (5:05 - 5:09)
I said I've been waiting for this event (5:07 - 5:11)
for a really long time and I'm really (5:09 - 5:12)
excited and there's gonna be lots of (5:11 - 5:15)
cool stuff today and whatever so that (5:12 - 5:18)
was my expectation was it was gonna be a (5:15 - 5:22)
lot of fun with new and old people and (5:18 - 5:27)
not flawless but pretty flawless well we (5:22 - 5:29)
talked about this a little bit on a (5:27 - 5:31)
couple episodes ago but we talked about (5:29 - 5:33)
they're gonna have cell problems and (5:31 - 5:37)
issues and you talked about how when a (5:33 - 5:39)
bunch of students come over to (5:37 - 5:42)
Georgetown you deploy repeaters and well (5:39 - 5:45)
not students but like let's say the (5:42 - 5:47)
President of the United States was going (5:45 - 5:48)
to be giving a speech at Georgetown (5:47 - 5:50)
which happens from time to time right (5:48 - 5:53)
yeah we fill that room with extra (5:50 - 5:57)
capacity for wireless service in that (5:53 - 6:01)
area which I believe they stated that (5:57 - 6:03)
that was their plan they were gonna put (6:01 - 6:05)
the sites on wheels cells on wheels (6:03 - 6:13)
meals on wheels no no music on wheels so (6:05 - 6:15)
what was your expectations and prior to (6:13 - 6:18)
coming cuz really we decided to fly you (6:15 - 6:22)
out here and get you a pass like a week (6:18 - 6:24)
before the show a week and a half yeah (6:22 - 6:30)
yeah I mean I was 90% like getting to (6:24 - 6:33)
see all of you guys and do Pokemon stuff (6:30 - 6:37)
but then also like have the perspective (6:33 - 6:40)
of somebody who's not like that hardcore (6:37 - 6:43)
Pokemon go player I I came in at level (6:40 - 6:47)
15 right kind of seeing how I could (6:43 - 6:48)
interact with everything that they were (6:47 - 6:51)
going to have that's not because I (6:48 - 6:53)
wasn't at that high level 30s or (6:51 - 6:56)
whatever the max cap level is now and (6:53 - 6:58)
seeing how all that stuff would have (6:56 - 7:00)
carried out for me (6:58 - 7:02)
but yeah I was expecting to see some (7:00 - 7:04)
pokemons some pokemons I hadn't seen (7:02 - 7:10)
before and meet people from all over who (7:04 - 7:12)
enjoy Pokemon for different reasons I (7:10 - 7:16)
will say real quick is a like actual (7:12 - 7:19)
Pokemon expectations I was like Oh (7:16 - 7:22)
internationals all over the place (7:19 - 7:27)
tons of Legendary's yeah that was that (7:22 - 7:30)
was kind of my expectation I mean I I (7:27 - 7:33)
was really hoping to be able to catch a (7:30 - 7:45)
Teddy reen yes I showed you the (7:33 - 7:48)
legendary raid trailer the night before (7:45 - 7:52)
we went through the list of banned items (7:48 - 7:55)
in the list of okay items so you kind of (7:52 - 7:59)
got the four for one for 404 with 404 (7:55 - 8:03)
for one one you got the I got the four (7:59 - 8:05)
one one the night before I mean you've (8:03 - 8:07)
been playing Pokemon girl a lot but what (8:05 - 8:10)
was your expectations prior to the event (8:07 - 8:14)
well I had to deal with a lot of extra (8:10 - 8:17)
Pokemon go in the last few weeks so I (8:14 - 8:21)
that as a result got me more excited for (8:17 - 8:25)
it I was expecting a lot of people I was (8:21 - 8:28)
expecting everything to go well just (8:25 - 8:30)
because like it's the one-year (8:28 - 8:33)
anniversary of the game the launch had a (8:30 - 8:35)
bunch of issues so I was like it'll be (8:33 - 8:37)
good it'll be smooth maybe we'll get a (8:35 - 8:40)
legendary maybe we'll get Mewtwo like (8:37 - 8:43)
see I was just excited to kind of just (8:40 - 8:47)
see what was there cuz I wasn't exactly (8:43 - 8:49)
sure what to expect (8:47 - 8:51)
they definitely teased Mewtwo in that (8:49 - 8:53)
trailer did they not it was at the very (8:51 - 8:56)
end yeah yeah the focus of the trailer (8:53 - 8:59)
was the the five bird birds and just for (8:56 - 9:02)
just for clarification mu and Celebi are (8:59 - 9:06)
not legendary Pokemon their mythical so (9:02 - 9:10)
I can't imagine that as Mewtwo and hoe (9:06 - 9:14)
and the other Pokemon that weren't at (9:10 - 9:16)
the event I can't imagine that Mew and (9:14 - 9:18)
Celebi are going to be part of that in (9:16 - 9:20)
the future yeah unless they start using (9:18 - 9:24)
the word mythical yeah mm-hmm I mean are (9:20 - 9:26)
they smart enough to make that (9:24 - 9:27)
distinction it technically is a (9:26 - 9:28)
different game (9:27 - 9:29)
well the Pokemon company is involved (9:28 - 9:33)
yeah I mean during during that legendary (9:29 - 9:36)
trailer it was like neon chick it was (9:33 - 9:37)
like across a building or whatever (9:36 - 9:38)
because they'd be the pan and then it (9:37 - 9:42)
was like the Pokemon company yeah summer (9:38 - 9:50)
2017 I was sunburned all right so Irene (9:42 - 9:54)
and I drove down we left probably 6:30 (9:50 - 9:57)
in the morning he left at 6:09 a.m. I (9:54 - 10:00)
remember it's about an hour 45 minutes (9:57 - 10:02)
from Milwaukee to downtown Chicago (10:00 - 10:05)
that's taken in consideration traffic (10:02 - 10:07)
because once you're about 30 minutes out (10:05 - 10:10)
of Chicago you're moving at parking lot (10:07 - 10:12)
speeds we parked pretty easy we parked (10:10 - 10:15)
under Grant Park we got our media passes (10:12 - 10:20)
and then I decided to go in to shoot the (10:15 - 10:22)
park this this is kind of the setup for (10:20 - 10:24)
the day as my first impressions of (10:22 - 10:26)
walking into the park I walked in about (10:24 - 10:29)
8:30 a.m. into the park so there was a (10:26 - 10:31)
couple other media people there but (10:29 - 10:33)
nothing else there was no early people (10:31 - 10:35)
because I think the Sprint customers got (10:33 - 10:38)
in at 9:00 the early catch while I was (10:35 - 10:41)
in there the three tents the three team (10:38 - 10:43)
stations valor instinctive mystic they (10:41 - 10:44)
weren't even set up they didn't matter (10:43 - 10:47)
the TV's plugged in they had at what (10:44 - 10:50)
time was this was 8:30 so a half hour (10:47 - 10:52)
before the early catch whoa the only (10:50 - 10:55)
place that was really fully set up was (10:52 - 10:57)
the store they had all the merchandise (10:55 - 10:58)
and everything and they were still (10:57 - 11:00)
unboxing stuff and they were counting (10:58 - 11:02)
cash and was like okay you guys seem (11:00 - 11:04)
like you're on track there the charging (11:02 - 11:07)
station wasn't set up the main stage (11:04 - 11:10)
wasn't set up they were still they (11:07 - 11:12)
didn't even have them the two big (11:10 - 11:14)
cameras for live streaming out in front (11:12 - 11:16)
of the stage yet and again this is a (11:14 - 11:17)
half hour before the event opens and (11:16 - 11:21)
then walking through like when I walked (11:17 - 11:22)
through I was like hey where's the media (11:21 - 11:24)
tent no one knew where it was it was (11:22 - 11:26)
actually right next to the entrance it (11:24 - 11:27)
was like around the corner (11:26 - 11:31)
yeah so everyone I was like this thing (11:27 - 11:34)
opens in a half-hour and uh it doesn't (11:31 - 11:39)
seem ready on top of Chicago is expected (11:34 - 11:40)
to get thunderstorms and rain throughout (11:39 - 11:42)
the day that was a big thing following (11:40 - 11:44)
the week yeah I mean I was checking on (11:42 - 11:46)
Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and (11:44 - 11:48)
even when we were driving in it was (11:46 - 11:49)
drizzling and I was like okay it looks (11:48 - 11:51)
like it's gonna be drizzling all day and (11:49 - 11:52)
it's funny because the night before (11:51 - 11:54)
Irene we went out and we bought ponchos (11:52 - 12:00)
we did they were green and red got one (11:54 - 12:04)
not like $0.89 Poncho's at Target and I (12:00 - 12:06)
had them all in my purse I was prepared (12:04 - 12:10)
ready to go very ready yes got all my (12:06 - 12:14)
banned items out yeah no umbrellas the (12:10 - 12:19)
actual ground was just soggy and muddy (12:14 - 12:22)
and that's how I got the nickname black (12:19 - 12:28)
foot wearing real shoes he was were (12:22 - 12:30)
covered in mud what was what was at (12:28 - 12:32)
least cool for me as I was able to get (12:30 - 12:34)
something from the store right away (12:32 - 12:37)
which I figured would be the hot (12:34 - 12:39)
contention point we have wait you used (12:37 - 12:42)
your media credential to get early (12:39 - 12:44)
access to the store oh yeah you are the (12:42 - 12:48)
lowest kind of human you didn't buy me (12:44 - 12:49)
anything what the heck well there's (12:48 - 12:51)
nothing really what did you buy I bought (12:49 - 12:55)
a mystic shirt because I not that okay (12:51 - 12:57)
here's a know here's the thing I'm off (12:55 - 12:59)
the stuff that's gonna sell out fast (12:57 - 13:02)
that he's gonna sell on eBay for four (12:59 - 13:05)
times the price my stuff I saw eBay pays (13:02 - 13:09)
for the supplies yeah I like buying (13:05 - 13:11)
stuff that first off I hate buying (13:09 - 13:13)
shirts because one I don't want to pay (13:11 - 13:15)
twenty eight dollars for a shirt but (13:13 - 13:16)
that's how much the shirt was and that's (13:15 - 13:19)
how much I paid and there never slim-fit (13:16 - 13:20)
I don't know if that's yeah they're (13:19 - 13:22)
never there never slim-fit no I like a (13:20 - 13:25)
good slim fit t-shirt I wear hoodies (13:22 - 13:27)
consistently so there's no point in me (13:25 - 13:29)
buying shirts with things on them (13:27 - 13:31)
because no one ever sees them for me I (13:29 - 13:32)
wanted to buy the shirt because I (13:31 - 13:34)
figured the shirt was only at the event (13:32 - 13:35)
and at least if it's hanging in my (13:34 - 13:38)
closet I can go up that was a day that (13:35 - 13:40)
happened (13:38 - 13:44)
it certainly did happen that was my (13:40 - 13:47)
thought with the shirt too was I think (13:44 - 13:48)
they're probably only gonna sell it here (13:47 - 13:51)
I might as well but nothing else there (13:48 - 13:54)
was enticing to me with two tipet's from (13:51 - 13:56)
buying the shirt because I also bought a (13:54 - 13:58)
Magikarp mega Blok thing that they had (13:56 - 14:00)
which actually wasn't advertised what (13:58 - 14:04)
yeah Legos by the time that I got to the (14:00 - 14:06)
store everything on that board was (14:04 - 14:09)
covered in black tape okay perfect aside (14:06 - 14:12)
yeah the shirts and I think a Bulbasaur (14:09 - 14:22)
pop socket pops out so it's like a (14:12 - 14:24)
handlebar be cool by the time I got to (14:22 - 14:26)
the store it was literally one team (14:24 - 14:31)
instinct to XL t-shirt and a Pikachu (14:26 - 14:35)
Pikachu hat they called them 3d Pikachu (14:31 - 14:38)
heads as the ears came out yeah when I (14:35 - 14:40)
went to buy the shirt this isn't that (14:38 - 14:41)
great of a story when I went to buy the (14:40 - 14:42)
shirt I was like hey I'll take a team (14:41 - 14:44)
mystic shirt and the guy was like I (14:42 - 14:46)
don't know what that means and I was (14:44 - 14:50)
like I want the blue one it was okay and (14:46 - 14:52)
then I was like let me get that Magikarp (14:50 - 14:54)
mega Blok thing and he was like you're (14:52 - 14:56)
gonna help you have to help me out here (14:54 - 15:00)
no like the orange fish can I get that (14:56 - 15:03)
so what was that like mega bloks like (15:00 - 15:05)
the Legos yeah like the far-fetched (15:03 - 15:09)
thing no it's not no I I don't even I (15:05 - 15:10)
I'm gonna be honest I haven't even (15:09 - 15:11)
looked at it (15:10 - 15:14)
I bought it it was eight bucks I threw (15:11 - 15:17)
it in my bag okay when I got back to my (15:14 - 15:18)
car I threw it in the trunk of my car (15:17 - 15:21)
it's probably still in my car I haven't (15:18 - 15:23)
looked right before right at nine (15:21 - 15:25)
o'clock when the first wave opened up (15:23 - 15:27)
these were the people that went out to (15:25 - 15:29)
sprint and got a specific wristband oh I (15:27 - 15:33)
didn't say the line to get in there were (15:29 - 15:37)
two lines there's always - always - no (15:33 - 15:38)
one ever tells you which line you are (15:37 - 15:39)
supposed to be in or which line you (15:38 - 15:44)
should be in I got a story for that so (15:39 - 15:47)
what we talked about will that most of (15:44 - 15:49)
the the reasons that most of these (15:47 - 15:51)
things were probably on the ban list was (15:49 - 15:53)
to get people in faster we (15:51 - 15:56)
like a pax situation wasn't please I (15:53 - 15:58)
don't know if we told you this Michael (15:56 - 16:00)
but at PAX East it was almost like an (15:58 - 16:02)
hour to two hours to get in and it was (16:00 - 16:05)
40 degrees out because everyone had to (16:02 - 16:07)
go through this is this is every single (16:05 - 16:09)
day good time this is where will adopted (16:07 - 16:13)
the policy of island alliance so if you (16:09 - 16:15)
didn't bring a bag to PAX East you got (16:13 - 16:18)
in instantly oh okay well we got in (16:15 - 16:21)
whatever is what we got we had media (16:18 - 16:23)
passes which worked here too I don't (16:21 - 16:24)
know why I don't know why you guys are (16:23 - 16:29)
so early in the day the same thing was (16:24 - 16:30)
the case if you didn't have a bag they (16:29 - 16:35)
let you in right away yep yep one's for (16:30 - 16:36)
people who didn't have bags but people (16:35 - 16:38)
had lined up at 6 o'clock in the morning (16:36 - 16:41)
you could line up as early as 6:00 there (16:38 - 16:43)
was no battle detectors but they did (16:41 - 16:47)
have the swipe we did they really yeah (16:43 - 16:49)
they didn't have when I was there (16:47 - 16:50)
oh they use did not meet twice when I (16:49 - 16:52)
was going in and out oh well I didn't (16:50 - 16:54)
maybe they gave up on it at some point (16:52 - 16:57)
yeah I was surprised that they had a (16:54 - 16:59)
physician like literally somebody (16:57 - 17:01)
checking that the pills in bottles (16:59 - 17:04)
matched the pills (17:01 - 17:04)
well when we went in we went in the lady (17:06 - 17:12)
was like medic and he came and he looked (17:10 - 17:15)
and I had a prescription medication and (17:12 - 17:20)
I had just like advil or something and (17:15 - 17:23)
except I think I used an old pill bottle (17:20 - 17:25)
for something else I was prescribed and (17:23 - 17:27)
the medic just like looked inside he was (17:25 - 17:30)
like and then he just put it back in my (17:27 - 17:32)
purse but I was like but they don't (17:30 - 17:34)
match the label like they're both given (17:32 - 17:35)
to me but like that's not I'm sure the (17:34 - 17:38)
medic knows like these are the pills I (17:35 - 17:41)
need to look out for yeah yeah honestly (17:38 - 17:43)
what they were doing was looking for any (17:41 - 17:46)
kind of drugs that would be used as you (17:43 - 17:48)
know even prescription drugs contraband (17:46 - 17:51)
or I mean overall they were looking to (17:48 - 17:53)
prevent any kind of alcohol or illegal (17:51 - 17:56)
substances like mind-altering (17:53 - 17:59)
recreational drugs yes yeah not a (17:56 - 18:04)
successful not successful okay says (17:59 - 18:08)
evidenced by our trip to the bathroom (18:04 - 18:08)
obviously people listening to this (18:09 - 18:12)
probably saw all my tweets on Twitter (18:11 - 18:14)
they probably saw everyone else's tweets (18:12 - 18:17)
on Twitter ah there was a man with the (18:14 - 18:17)
goat (18:17 - 18:22)
there was about the man of the gun the (18:17 - 18:29)
whole show was a disaster when this goes (18:22 - 18:35)
up I expected there to be a line and for (18:29 - 18:38)
that line to you know you're back in (18:35 - 18:40)
line you might wait 30 to 45 minutes to (18:38 - 18:42)
get in can I talk about my line (18:40 - 18:44)
experience since I of the four of us I (18:42 - 18:46)
was the only one that had to stand in (18:44 - 18:48)
line you didn't get media past correct (18:46 - 18:51)
yeah easier the car credential together (18:48 - 18:55)
nope yeah they they originally only gave (18:51 - 18:57)
me one media pass and when I got there (18:55 - 18:59)
they were like oh you we can give you (18:57 - 19:01)
two more so I give it to will and I read (18:59 - 19:03)
before they started letting people in (19:01 - 19:05)
though so you were in the wrong line (19:03 - 19:08)
correct there was no sign or any kind of (19:05 - 19:10)
information you didn't what line was (19:08 - 19:12)
what I didn't see that like everyone had (19:10 - 19:14)
yellow wristbands nope because we saw a (19:12 - 19:17)
line of people that was moving and we (19:14 - 19:19)
went to the end of it or what looked (19:17 - 19:20)
like the end of it and got in line as (19:19 - 19:23)
the line it was just a stream of people (19:20 - 19:25)
walking it never stopped it anymore he (19:23 - 19:27)
wouldn't have noticed and I thought that (19:25 - 19:29)
you guys knew because I feel like I (19:27 - 19:31)
thought I said something about the two (19:29 - 19:35)
lines no I didn't know there was two (19:31 - 19:37)
lines yeah there was one that was on the (19:35 - 19:40)
left which was the early entry was the (19:37 - 19:42)
corner yeah the early entry one was the (19:40 - 19:43)
one that Becky and I got in line for (19:42 - 19:45)
yeah there was someone right at the (19:43 - 19:47)
corner where he would turn to head (19:45 - 19:49)
towards the entrance that last block (19:47 - 19:52)
that was checking people there in their (19:49 - 19:54)
wrists that was the only instance of (19:52 - 19:57)
anybody saying that there was that this (19:54 - 19:59)
line was specifically for people who had (19:57 - 20:01)
wristbands and it wasn't until you were (19:59 - 20:04)
maybe like 500 feet from the entrance or (20:01 - 20:07)
whatever so it wasn't until we got to (20:04 - 20:09)
like close to that point that the guy (20:07 - 20:11)
behind us in line said you cut in line (20:09 - 20:15)
and we went but how we got in line where (20:11 - 20:17)
if nobody else was behind us and yes (20:15 - 20:19)
that you don't have wristbands and we (20:17 - 20:20)
said wrists (20:19 - 20:22)
pants for what and he said this is the (20:20 - 20:24)
early access yeah the otherwise other (20:22 - 20:28)
side of the park so my you got so you (20:24 - 20:30)
got out oh yeah we did did you just stay (20:28 - 20:32)
in and see what happened oh no no but (20:30 - 20:36)
they weren't letting we because we (20:32 - 20:36)
turning that corner the person who was (20:38 - 20:43)
standing there telling people the Spence (20:41 - 20:45)
was also taking people out of okay got (20:43 - 20:46)
it (20:45 - 20:47)
so they would have gotten taken out of (20:46 - 20:49)
line maybe a few minutes it mattered I (20:47 - 20:50)
feel like if one or two people without (20:49 - 20:52)
wristbands just happened to wait in that (20:50 - 20:54)
line for 45 minutes they get up I would (20:52 - 20:56)
be like just go in that's you (20:54 - 20:58)
yeah you've wasted 45 minutes early no (20:56 - 21:00)
they were not super willing to let (20:58 - 21:02)
people get away with thing yeah and what (21:00 - 21:04)
they really needed was just somebody (21:02 - 21:07)
like somebody official walking past line (21:04 - 21:09)
just saying aren't respect extra (21:07 - 21:10)
wristbands only it is spring though so (21:09 - 21:12)
there's only just to let people know (21:10 - 21:13)
because I'm sure you guys weren't the (21:12 - 21:15)
only ones who me no stake because when (21:13 - 21:18)
we okay so when we got to the that point (21:15 - 21:20)
and they said that you have to go to the (21:18 - 21:23)
other line we went all the way across (21:20 - 21:26)
the other side of the park and that was (21:23 - 21:28)
the real line that was the line for (21:26 - 21:30)
people who were not really and you're (21:28 - 21:33)
saying that I know the answer that line (21:30 - 21:35)
was probably three times longer (21:33 - 21:40)
it was zigzagging in multiple angles to (21:35 - 21:41)
the point that it just looked like a (21:40 - 21:44)
massive people they were easily like (21:41 - 21:46)
they said 20,000 people showed up (21:44 - 21:49)
yesterday yeah that was easily 19,000 of (21:46 - 21:51)
the people right I can't imagine that (21:49 - 21:54)
the Sprint promotion which was Friday (21:51 - 21:57)
night and Thursday there's Thursday and (21:54 - 21:59)
Friday night I can't imagine they handed (21:57 - 22:02)
out over like a thousand wristbands fine (21:59 - 22:05)
so when we got in line probably already (22:02 - 22:08)
at that point 10 to 12,000 people in (22:05 - 22:09)
front of us I walked into the park (22:08 - 22:12)
before everyone they said come back for (22:09 - 22:15)
your QR code we're not giving them out (22:12 - 22:17)
right now and I said okay they said just (22:15 - 22:18)
come back at nine o'clock come back (22:17 - 22:19)
anyways because we want on the media (22:18 - 22:21)
people here it's just so we can give (22:19 - 22:23)
them a rundown of the show yeah okay (22:21 - 22:25)
cool come back I don't know what the QR (22:23 - 22:28)
code is for but there were stops inside (22:25 - 22:30)
the park that had a Pokemon go logo (22:28 - 22:33)
above them it said like Chicago fest or (22:30 - 22:33)
something (22:33 - 22:35)
yeah I was like yellow instead of that (22:33 - 22:38)
picture of whatever it was and I didn't (22:35 - 22:41)
think of it because my I had a game plan (22:38 - 22:44)
I had everything but I had the Poncho's (22:41 - 22:47)
I had battery packs I had my camera (22:44 - 22:50)
I had my recorder I knew going into this (22:47 - 22:52)
event how what I was gonna do when I was (22:50 - 22:54)
gonna do it and how I was gonna do it (22:52 - 22:58)
when I walked in I didn't think to swipe (22:54 - 23:01)
any of those stops because if you pop a (22:58 - 23:03)
lucky egg and then swipe the stop you (23:01 - 23:05)
get double and it's the first time (23:03 - 23:07)
you're swiping it so it's worth five or (23:05 - 23:09)
it's worth 250 instead of 50 and then (23:07 - 23:11)
with the lucky egg it's 500 so I was (23:09 - 23:14)
gonna maximize and pop the lucky egg and (23:11 - 23:16)
then hit all I think there was like 14 (23:14 - 23:19)
unique stops in there yeah so I didn't (23:16 - 23:21)
think of swiping it but when you didn't (23:19 - 23:25)
go and swipe it the first time it asked (23:21 - 23:28)
to scan a unique QR code which I found (23:25 - 23:30)
out after 9 o'clock but when I was in (23:28 - 23:33)
the park I did get my QR code a little (23:30 - 23:35)
bit early and then I scanned it and then (23:33 - 23:37)
right away there was a hair cross and I (23:35 - 23:40)
was like oh cool because when we were (23:37 - 23:42)
when Irene and I were walking past the (23:40 - 23:44)
line somebody was like hey did you they (23:42 - 23:45)
were talking to each other not to us but (23:44 - 23:47)
they're like hey did you see the hair (23:45 - 23:49)
across there's a hair across and but (23:47 - 23:51)
that in retrospect that doesn't make (23:49 - 23:52)
sense because I thought you could only (23:51 - 23:54)
see hair across when you sweat and the (23:52 - 23:57)
QR I think no I think because when we (23:54 - 23:58)
were in that line I could see spawns (23:57 - 24:01)
inside the park but you couldn't swipe (23:58 - 24:04)
the stops even though if even though you (24:01 - 24:07)
could be in range of the stops outside (24:04 - 24:09)
of the park you couldn't you couldn't (24:07 - 24:11)
swipe them at all because you kind of (24:09 - 24:14)
have the QR code in order to swipe so (24:11 - 24:16)
they did change it halfway through but (24:14 - 24:18)
technically heracross was only spawning (24:16 - 24:21)
within the gates so you didn't see hair (24:18 - 24:23)
crossed I would see like you know (24:21 - 24:26)
normals like pinyon yeah ever I saw a (24:23 - 24:29)
yogi at one point so then once you (24:26 - 24:33)
swiped the stop the all the logos above (24:29 - 24:36)
went away no no they were still up no (24:33 - 24:38)
for me they were all gone instantly so (24:36 - 24:40)
that's where I think the server issues (24:38 - 24:43)
came in because when I swiped the stop (24:40 - 24:46)
all the logos went away instantly it was (24:43 - 24:46)
like (24:46 - 24:49)
okay cool it gets all up because I (24:46 - 24:51)
originally thought oh I have to scan the (24:49 - 24:53)
QR code per each stop that's kind of a (24:51 - 24:56)
hassle but I get it cuz they want to (24:53 - 24:58)
lock these inside the park for the (24:56 - 25:00)
players and prevents poopers from (24:58 - 25:02)
showing up and doing their thing they (25:00 - 25:05)
let all the they start letting the (25:02 - 25:07)
sprint people in and they let them in (25:05 - 25:09)
fast like it went from zero people in (25:07 - 25:12)
the park to what seemed to be like seven (25:09 - 25:14)
to eight hundred people yeah pretty (25:12 - 25:18)
pretty instantly and that's when like (25:14 - 25:19)
everyone kind of spread out it was OMA (25:18 - 25:23)
it was either they went right to the (25:19 - 25:24)
Sprint kiosks cuz there was a sprint (25:23 - 25:26)
kiosk where if you showed them what (25:24 - 25:27)
level you were they would give you (25:26 - 25:30)
actual like patch that you would put on (25:27 - 25:33)
your your denim jean jacket iron that on (25:30 - 25:34)
there was no one there with the denim (25:33 - 25:37)
jean jacket Thanks I mean I was closer (25:34 - 25:39)
yeah yeah you're way overdressed but so (25:37 - 25:43)
that that line was was out of control (25:39 - 25:47)
right away there was a Boost Mobile (25:43 - 25:49)
truck kiosk that was selling batteries (25:47 - 25:51)
that filled up instantly and people were (25:49 - 25:54)
buying batteries right away boost a (25:51 - 25:56)
subsidiary of Sprint I think they were (25:54 - 25:59)
also selling phones were they not yes (25:56 - 26:01)
okay I have a story about that too and (25:59 - 26:03)
then most of the other people went to (26:01 - 26:05)
their designated tents so when they did (26:03 - 26:07)
finally get the tent set up it was (26:05 - 26:10)
probably like 15 picnic tables in each (26:07 - 26:13)
tent and then three to four TVs and then (26:10 - 26:15)
a mini concession stand in the back that (26:13 - 26:17)
sold a couple things they had those (26:15 - 26:20)
banana loungers - oh yeah then the jump (26:17 - 26:22)
bean bags yeah yeah but the concession (26:20 - 26:25)
stands only sold beverages in the tents (26:22 - 26:27)
yes everyone kind of spread out and then (26:25 - 26:28)
there was this weird middle of the park (26:27 - 26:30)
that was empty and it kind of made sense (26:28 - 26:32)
too because the ground was so muddy (26:30 - 26:34)
still and the first thing that happened (26:32 - 26:37)
it was like 9:15 9:20 so most of the (26:34 - 26:40)
Sprint customers are in somebody else (26:37 - 26:44)
unknown just people running I haven't (26:40 - 26:47)
seen people run for a Pokemon since the (26:44 - 26:50)
the first week of the game yeah and so (26:47 - 26:52)
people are just sprinting to this spot (26:50 - 26:53)
and it was actually over by the media (26:52 - 26:55)
tents and sure enough there was an (26:53 - 26:56)
unknown there and I caught it and (26:55 - 26:58)
everything seemed to be fine and then (26:56 - 27:00)
about 10 minutes later (26:58 - 27:03)
no one could connect but it didn't seem (27:00 - 27:05)
like they didn't seem like they it (27:03 - 27:07)
didn't seem like they let in more people (27:05 - 27:09)
because the rest of the people didn't (27:07 - 27:12)
get in until 10 yeah the story of the (27:09 - 27:15)
cursed you know the media tent had like (27:12 - 27:19)
media Wi-Fi where once he got in the (27:15 - 27:20)
tent there was like a password written (27:19 - 27:24)
on like a piece of paper above the free (27:20 - 27:24)
water (27:24 - 27:29)
okay so media Wi-Fi didn't work I don't (27:24 - 27:31)
think it worked all day ah absolute (27:29 - 27:34)
trash so I'm on 18 - what what are you (27:31 - 27:39)
on will Haiti Irene sprint 18 - okay it (27:34 - 27:42)
racks print if you're an 18 t customer (27:39 - 27:44)
so this is what I don't understand these (27:42 - 27:47)
parks were most of the part built and (27:44 - 27:50)
sponsored by 18 t's money are you sure (27:47 - 27:52)
like that is Millennium Park but it's (27:50 - 27:56)
all part of it now like money in parks (27:52 - 27:58)
next door the Millennium Park garage is (27:56 - 28:01)
also it says like Millennium Park grant (27:58 - 28:03)
North Millennium Park grant south yeah (28:01 - 28:05)
but they can put a sign on anything I (28:03 - 28:09)
guess either way even if even if grant (28:05 - 28:12)
park wasn't 18 t's park yes the park (28:09 - 28:15)
across the street with the giant silver (28:12 - 28:21)
bean nugget what's paid for by 18 yeah (28:15 - 28:23)
there's also have right next to that (28:21 - 28:27)
Park is a massive 18 T Tower I have a (28:23 - 28:29)
conspiracy starting to farm in my head (28:27 - 28:32)
the AT&T was a little twisted that (28:29 - 28:35)
Sprint is like getting all the attention (28:32 - 28:36)
on this particular event and they're (28:35 - 28:38)
like oh we're gonna take our toys and go (28:36 - 28:40)
home (28:38 - 28:43)
folks I don't I don't know where the 18 (28:40 - 28:45)
t Wi-Fi was but you know you go to (28:43 - 28:48)
Starbucks or an 18 T store or if you're (28:45 - 28:51)
in the mall it'll say 18 t Wi-Fi and if (28:48 - 28:53)
you're an AT&T customer you instantly (28:51 - 28:55)
connect to it you get free Wi-Fi you (28:53 - 28:56)
don't have to do anything I don't I read (28:55 - 28:58)
the Sprint have something like that (28:56 - 28:59)
where if you walk into a Sprint store (28:58 - 29:01)
you connect their Wi-Fi for free no (28:59 - 29:04)
issues you just I have absolutely no (29:01 - 29:07)
idea okay I know I can actually tell you (29:04 - 29:10)
exactly the spots in the park that the (29:07 - 29:13)
18 t Wi-Fi working and it was mostly (29:10 - 29:14)
every (29:13 - 29:18)
corner like a back corner of the event (29:14 - 29:21)
around the ID like edge parts and by the (29:18 - 29:24)
media tents there was pretty good 18 t (29:21 - 29:27)
Wi-Fi but did you notice because we were (29:24 - 29:28)
standing by the media tent the entire (29:27 - 29:32)
time that the spawns were ultimately the (29:28 - 29:34)
same and happened at the same time I (29:32 - 29:35)
noticed this throughout the day because (29:34 - 29:37)
I didn't have much else to look at but (29:35 - 29:40)
it was always a Machop Machop Machop (29:37 - 29:45)
Machop my wife called the Machop man man (29:40 - 29:47)
chomp at one point man there was always (29:45 - 29:52)
a man chomp yep a snubbull and like one (29:47 - 30:00)
other pretty common Pokemon at the same (29:52 - 30:02)
time near the main stage which the media (30:00 - 30:04)
tent was behind the main stage yeah all (30:02 - 30:06)
those kind of pop at the same time and (30:04 - 30:08)
then like once an hour we're now maybe (30:06 - 30:11)
once every half hour it was a like a (30:08 - 30:13)
cypher popped up or larva Tarr so a (30:11 - 30:16)
couple Scyther hey larvae Tarr I didn't (30:13 - 30:19)
see any love I couldn't shut up (30:16 - 30:23)
so I read and I got our first unknowns (30:19 - 30:25)
we were in the media area no we weren't (30:23 - 30:27)
we got our first unknowns when we were (30:25 - 30:31)
over in the corner yes that's how I know (30:27 - 30:34)
we were in the corner over by because I (30:31 - 30:36)
went to the restroom and then we crossed (30:34 - 30:40)
over and we were over in the shaded give (30:36 - 30:42)
me a give me a restroom update what (30:40 - 30:44)
about him there porta-potties all right (30:42 - 30:48)
I actually I will give a lot of credit (30:44 - 30:51)
to everyone who attended Pokemon go (30:48 - 30:52)
fests what they did not trash the (30:51 - 30:55)
porta-potties they actually like they (30:52 - 30:56)
were pretty decent throughout the day I (30:55 - 30:58)
used them multiple times throughout the (30:56 - 31:01)
day I also am very happy there is an (30:58 - 31:02)
option that you can get with your (31:01 - 31:04)
port-a-potty order to have a portable (31:02 - 31:07)
hand washing station which is which some (31:04 - 31:09)
people didn't know figure out understand (31:07 - 31:12)
that you pump a pump with your foot and (31:09 - 31:15)
actual water comes out of a sink and you (31:12 - 31:16)
can wash your hands with soap and water (31:15 - 31:19)
they had those which is really nice yeah (31:16 - 31:21)
they did but did people use those yes (31:19 - 31:25)
yeah no my the unknown was in the corner (31:21 - 31:27)
and then later on we went (31:25 - 31:30)
yeah okay so Mikey you got in the other (31:27 - 31:33)
line yes I was this is another thing (31:30 - 31:35)
maybe it was just my phone but I called (31:33 - 31:36)
multiple like I called Irene I called (31:35 - 31:38)
you I called my mom I think I called (31:36 - 31:40)
will a couple times and most of the (31:38 - 31:43)
conversations were hello hello hello I (31:40 - 31:46)
yeah we had a conversation at one point (31:43 - 31:49)
while I was in line for maybe five (31:46 - 31:52)
minutes and I heard you for the first (31:49 - 31:54)
like two of it without issue and then it (31:52 - 31:57)
was non-stop cutting in and out I was (31:54 - 31:58)
like struggling me and that was (31:57 - 32:00)
throughout the day where I could I (31:58 - 32:03)
couldn't even make a phone call unless I (32:00 - 32:06)
was connected to the AT&T Wi-Fi which (32:03 - 32:09)
was only like a fifty square foot radius (32:06 - 32:12)
outside the media tent and when did you (32:09 - 32:14)
actually walk through the doors and walk (32:12 - 32:19)
into the park at about 12:45 yep we were (32:14 - 32:22)
in line for almost three hours and you (32:19 - 32:24)
didn't get the room the beeping no they (32:22 - 32:26)
were rushing people through they barely (32:24 - 32:29)
looked at my bag they didn't find the (32:26 - 32:32)
medication that I had in there they (32:29 - 32:35)
barely looked in Becky's purse they just (32:32 - 32:38)
opened it moved my hoodie around and (32:35 - 32:41)
went all right whatever and gave it back (32:38 - 32:43)
to me and said go ahead and I went (32:41 - 32:45)
through so for the two hours and 45 (32:43 - 32:47)
minutes you were in line we talked a (32:45 - 32:49)
couple times so I was I called you at (32:47 - 32:51)
least probably two to three times during (32:49 - 32:53)
that yeah and I was texting I tried to (32:51 - 32:57)
draw diagrams of where I was I couldn't (32:53 - 32:59)
tell the difference between your diagram (32:57 - 33:00)
and a ziggurat that's not confusing the (32:59 - 33:04)
entire every every conversation was with (33:00 - 33:06)
with you Michael was nothing is working (33:04 - 33:09)
yeah you could and I can't catch (33:06 - 33:17)
anything I felt my mom was actually with (33:09 - 33:19)
you guys too yeah I felt terrible (33:17 - 33:20)
because you guys were in line but at the (33:19 - 33:24)
same time we were doing nothing yet we (33:20 - 33:26)
met some amazing plan and there were (33:24 - 33:28)
there were two there were two girls (33:26 - 33:31)
behind us from Colorado that flew from (33:28 - 33:34)
Colorado to be here and there was a guy (33:31 - 33:37)
from Peoria Illinois who was with us (33:34 - 33:40)
and we spent the whole time in line (33:37 - 33:41)
chatting with them and Joe (33:40 - 33:44)
they were super nice they were super fun (33:41 - 33:47)
one of the girls from Colorado had like (33:44 - 33:50)
the best attitude about everything that (33:47 - 33:53)
was happening just like really positive (33:50 - 33:55)
perspective and it it really (33:53 - 33:58)
significantly helped waiting in line for (33:55 - 34:00)
three hours but one of the jokes was I (33:58 - 34:03)
was updating them as you were updating (34:00 - 34:14)
me I was getting all the insider info at (34:03 - 34:17)
one point I told them nobody inside has (34:14 - 34:19)
any service and we were at the point (34:17 - 34:22)
where the these lines were zigzagging (34:19 - 34:24)
and any time we went around a bend that (34:22 - 34:26)
was like a milestone so we were all like (34:24 - 34:28)
we made it around another band really (34:26 - 34:30)
like we did it and so then when we got (34:28 - 34:33)
to the end and it started to just be a (34:30 - 34:35)
straight line straight to the park they (34:33 - 34:37)
were like oh we don't have any more (34:35 - 34:38)
bends now it's just a boring walk and I (34:37 - 34:41)
said it's okay when we get inside we (34:38 - 34:47)
won't have service and they said I kind (34:41 - 34:48)
of just want to stay in line then (34:47 - 34:51)
because we have service out here and we (34:48 - 34:52)
can just keep talking and have a good (34:51 - 34:54)
time and we don't have to worry about it (34:52 - 34:58)
oh that's such a nice space really it (34:54 - 35:00)
was great and then we got inside and and (34:58 - 35:05)
that was it and you never stopped what (35:00 - 35:07)
we'll do is we'll take a quick break and (35:05 - 35:10)
when we come back we'll talk about John (35:07 - 35:13)
Hanke coming out on stage and and pretty (35:10 - 35:19)
much the day ending at that point yep so (35:13 - 35:21)
we'll be right back (35:19 - 35:21)
lect (35:23 - 35:28)
tubes flag tube with leg tubes 2 flex (35:25 - 35:32)
tubes flag tube with leg tubes to (35:28 - 35:37)
warmers socks the fray isn't like it to (35:32 - 35:41)
Mike good right the phrasing black it to (35:37 - 35:44)
my (35:41 - 35:49)
like tubes leg to leg tubes to leg to (35:44 - 35:59)
leg to leg and we are back from our (35:49 - 36:03)
break let's talk about why we we know (35:59 - 36:05)
Micah spent most of the day in line but (36:03 - 36:08)
let me let me add that it was in direct (36:05 - 36:11)
sunlight the entire time and my forehead (36:08 - 36:15)
is completely burnt yes I Becky is my (36:11 - 36:18)
wife is already super pale she was (36:15 - 36:21)
completely roasted by the time last (36:18 - 36:24)
night like two tone roasted like sick (36:21 - 36:28)
burns Rosa Clara she could barely lay in (36:24 - 36:30)
bed because it hurts so much (36:28 - 36:34)
no I was completely fine now the reason (36:30 - 36:36)
that we got so sunburned though is (36:34 - 36:38)
because one of the rules one of the the (36:36 - 36:41)
prohibited items was specifically that (36:38 - 36:44)
you couldn't bring sunburned to the park (36:41 - 36:46)
or sunscreen into the parts you could (36:44 - 36:51)
bring plenty of sunburn in you couldn't (36:46 - 36:54)
bring sunscreen in unless it was sealed (36:51 - 36:57)
if we opened the sunscreen prior to (36:54 - 36:59)
getting into the park we had to just (36:57 - 37:02)
throw it out yo we were smart we would (36:59 - 37:05)
have brought two sunscreen one to open (37:02 - 37:08)
inline use and then throw away and one (37:05 - 37:10)
to bring in that was sealed yes but (37:08 - 37:12)
we're not smart (37:10 - 37:14)
yeah we're sunburned and I asked someone (37:12 - 37:15)
to add a little color because I know (37:14 - 37:18)
what Steve wants to talk about next that (37:15 - 37:22)
uh I didn't have a lot of problems (37:18 - 37:25)
connecting and staying connected when I (37:22 - 37:30)
was inside and I didn't talk to a lot of (37:25 - 37:33)
you guys at that point so well what (37:30 - 37:36)
comes next came as a little bit of a (37:33 - 37:39)
surprise to me so there were definitely (37:36 - 37:42)
people in the park playing like me the (37:39 - 37:45)
entire like the entire time and I don't (37:42 - 37:46)
know if they were playing consistently (37:45 - 37:48)
the entire time because there were there (37:46 - 37:49)
was at a point will that you had issues (37:48 - 37:52)
yeah yeah and then I put my sheet on (37:49 - 37:57)
that helps tremendously because you you (37:52 - 37:58)
VP and out (37:57 - 38:01)
correct I wonder if I wonder if a lot (37:58 - 38:03)
like the people that were playing (38:01 - 38:04)
consistently like you also did that (38:03 - 38:08)
Irene I I didn't pay attention to any of (38:04 - 38:10)
these but there were the challenge (38:08 - 38:11)
events throughout the day do you (38:10 - 38:12)
remember when the first one started (38:11 - 38:16)
first one started at 11 o'clock correct (38:12 - 38:19)
prior to this the main stage I think (38:16 - 38:22)
about 10 15 ish called everyone over (38:19 - 38:24)
they like everyone gather around the (38:22 - 38:27)
main stage so we can kick off Pokemon (38:24 - 38:29)
and go fast and at this point I'm (38:27 - 38:31)
telling Micah and my Casilla lied and (38:29 - 38:32)
he's like I'm gonna fit and miss the (38:31 - 38:34)
first challenge and I was like well I (38:32 - 38:36)
don't know if there's going to be a (38:34 - 38:38)
first challenge because unless they fix (38:36 - 38:39)
this in 45 minutes (38:38 - 38:41)
yeah all these players cannot connect (38:39 - 38:44)
and when you said that I thought you (38:41 - 38:46)
meant there's not enough people in the (38:44 - 38:49)
park yet too because like I was not (38:46 - 38:51)
aware of these other issues I was like (38:49 - 38:53)
there's not enough people in here to (38:51 - 38:57)
meet the challenge and the first time I (38:53 - 39:02)
noticed issues was actually after mate (38:57 - 39:06)
was during the main stage intro because (39:02 - 39:09)
there were technical difficulties with (39:06 - 39:13)
the screens and their sound and all of (39:09 - 39:15)
that stuff when they were trying to come (39:13 - 39:17)
out and be like hey everyone the screen (39:15 - 39:19)
was flickering and then it wasn't (39:17 - 39:21)
matching up or playing some bumpin music (39:19 - 39:24)
no and he was trying to and the lady was (39:21 - 39:27)
our DJ and it was just like actually (39:24 - 39:32)
like it was just like not working if (39:27 - 39:35)
anybody wants to go on my Instagram one (39:32 - 39:38)
of my Instagram posts was the six acog (39:35 - 39:40)
Oh house beats and it's about a two (39:38 - 39:43)
minutes the Busic we got to enjoy while (39:40 - 39:45)
we were waiting I liked it it wasn't bad (39:43 - 39:49)
no I didn't play bad music the first (39:45 - 39:52)
woman came out and I apologize I don't (39:49 - 39:54)
know her name I looked her up prior cuz (39:52 - 39:56)
they they announced the three women and (39:54 - 39:58)
then mystic seven and I know two of (39:56 - 40:01)
those two of those females were (39:58 - 40:03)
professional commentators for some (40:01 - 40:06)
eSports stuff and then the third one was (40:03 - 40:08)
a really big Pokemon like she was super (40:06 - 40:11)
into Pokemon go and then the fourth (40:08 - 40:12)
person was mystics (40:11 - 40:14)
and they brought out one of them I think (40:12 - 40:18)
it was Lindsay maybe I don't know I read (40:14 - 40:20)
it there I didn't know any of these (40:18 - 40:22)
people I barely knew who mystic 7oz I (40:20 - 40:25)
seen I read you want to describe what (40:22 - 40:29)
the crowd did when we'll call our (40:25 - 40:31)
Lindsay when Lindsay came out let me ask (40:29 - 40:33)
first when she came out did they cut (40:31 - 40:37)
those sick beats yes no more sick B I (40:33 - 40:41)
was yes that's unfortunate I think it (40:37 - 40:43)
might have been an undercurrent not like (40:41 - 40:44)
as loud but ever did they cut it (40:43 - 40:47)
completely well I wasn't yeah I wasn't (40:44 - 40:51)
really having any issues up until like I (40:47 - 40:56)
was saying when the intro came from the (40:51 - 40:59)
main stage she was trying to get (40:56 - 41:01)
everyone pumped up and she was like is (40:59 - 41:03)
everyone ready for Pokemon go fast and (41:01 - 41:09)
it was just like well they were like (41:03 - 41:13)
they did but they were chanting fix the (41:09 - 41:17)
fix the servers because she was at some (41:13 - 41:19)
point she was like let's give it up for (41:17 - 41:21)
Niantic and I think that was when that (41:19 - 41:23)
was the that was the big boo because (41:21 - 41:26)
they were like fix the game we can't (41:23 - 41:32)
play what what is happening like I don't (41:26 - 41:35)
understand I you know she stuck to her (41:32 - 41:38)
script and she none of this is her fault (41:35 - 41:41)
or any of the other presenters fault I'd (41:38 - 41:43)
actually be curious to watch that twitch (41:41 - 41:46)
stream now and like see in retrospect (41:43 - 41:49)
what happened because I heard that the (41:46 - 41:51)
twitch stream was also just a disaster (41:49 - 41:54)
and we wasn't and it wasn't fun to watch (41:51 - 41:58)
that I didn't so what I heard from (41:54 - 42:00)
people around the world like litter as (41:58 - 42:01)
it was going on people were messaging me (42:00 - 42:04)
and they're like we don't understand (42:01 - 42:06)
what's happening but it doesn't look (42:04 - 42:10)
that bad what's going on right so (42:06 - 42:13)
there's a difference in it doesn't (42:10 - 42:16)
outwardly look like there are problems (42:13 - 42:19)
as much as there probably were and what (42:16 - 42:20)
you're saying and that it wasn't (42:19 - 42:22)
enjoyable to watch is that what people (42:20 - 42:25)
know because i yeah i got like it looks (42:22 - 42:25)
like every (42:25 - 42:29)
he's havin so much fun oh I didn't see I (42:25 - 42:31)
didn't see I didn't see any of it but (42:29 - 42:34)
you're saying that people said it wasn't (42:31 - 42:36)
like an enjoyable Thank You ash yeah I (42:34 - 42:40)
think even Jo from Sara B was was like (42:36 - 42:42)
this stream as a disaster and some other (42:40 - 42:44)
people said that I I was trying to chat (42:42 - 42:45)
throughout with people throughout the (42:44 - 42:48)
day but they're pretty much chanting ik (42:45 - 42:51)
fixed the servers nothing's working we (42:48 - 42:53)
can't I think we can't play was another (42:51 - 42:56)
chance yeah and they did this throughout (42:53 - 43:00)
Lindsey's entire script hope her name (42:56 - 43:07)
was Lindsey hey well it is now like very (43:00 - 43:10)
professional for her to you know you (43:07 - 43:12)
know power through that stick to the (43:10 - 43:15)
script you what she needed to but it was (43:12 - 43:17)
a lost cause like they didn't want to (43:15 - 43:19)
hear any of what she was saying no one (43:17 - 43:22)
oh no no one did no one was listening no (43:19 - 43:25)
one was excited she was trying to you if (43:22 - 43:29)
the game was working that script (43:25 - 43:30)
probably would have went over really (43:29 - 43:33)
well yes yeah well then she introduced (43:30 - 43:36)
John Hanke which is the CEO of Niantic (43:33 - 43:39)
person directly in charge of Pokemon go (43:36 - 43:44)
and ingress he came out to boos oh yeah (43:39 - 43:46)
that that was the big one I was mistaken (43:44 - 43:49)
earlier I had heard too from someone who (43:46 - 43:50)
was watching the stream that they had (43:49 - 43:54)
saw that people also at least one or at (43:50 - 43:56)
one or two instances of people throwing (43:54 - 44:00)
stuff yeah which is not cool (43:56 - 44:02)
I didn't yeah I didn't see that I was I (44:00 - 44:04)
mean I was I was filming it the entire (44:02 - 44:05)
time so I was kind of looking at my (44:04 - 44:09)
camera screen not the not the audience I (44:05 - 44:11)
didn't see that but he opened with (44:09 - 44:13)
thanking everyone for coming and then (44:11 - 44:15)
more boos followed and more we can't (44:13 - 44:20)
play yep and then he said we know that (44:15 - 44:22)
we're having issues with our carriers (44:20 - 44:24)
and we know we're having issues with the (44:22 - 44:25)
game knee antic is working really hard (44:24 - 44:28)
to fix the game and we're working really (44:25 - 44:30)
hard with carriers to fix the server so (44:28 - 44:32)
you guys can play and that was like the (44:30 - 44:37)
first cheer yeah of just acknowledging (44:32 - 44:39)
it really put a lot of people at (44:37 - 44:42)
ease of like okay cool you know we just (44:39 - 44:45)
got in the days just starting but what (44:42 - 44:48)
what what he said what he said and I (44:45 - 44:51)
think rang very true to how the whole (44:48 - 44:52)
day should have been he said it's not a (44:51 - 44:54)
sprint it's a marathon (44:52 - 44:56)
don't worry like you'll be able to catch (44:54 - 44:59)
all the rare Pokemon there'll be plenty (44:56 - 45:01)
of spawns I think he mentioned heracross (44:59 - 45:03)
he's like if you if you missed hair (45:01 - 45:05)
cross hair across will be out throughout (45:03 - 45:07)
the day and I was like this like this (45:05 - 45:10)
feels real this doesn't feel like a (45:07 - 45:12)
script this like you were coming out (45:10 - 45:14)
anyways to say something yeah but it (45:12 - 45:16)
seemed like you adjusted and just kind (45:14 - 45:18)
of talked on the fly of like hey we know (45:16 - 45:20)
their server issues we're fixing it (45:18 - 45:20)
don't worry (45:20 - 45:24)
today will be really fun even if like to (45:20 - 45:25)
me at this at this point in time I'm (45:24 - 45:27)
thinking okay it might take him in an (45:25 - 45:29)
hour or two to get the game but even if (45:27 - 45:30)
they get it fixed by one that's still (45:29 - 45:34)
six hours of playing yeah yeah we find (45:30 - 45:35)
out that that actually doesn't happen (45:34 - 45:40)
yeah and finally you so Micah got and (45:35 - 45:42)
everyone else got in there was no line (45:40 - 45:44)
to get in anymore (45:42 - 45:48)
correct we about maybe 400 feet from the (45:44 - 45:51)
from the gate from the entrance lost (45:48 - 45:54)
service like we didn't even get in and (45:51 - 45:55)
we already didn't have service there you (45:54 - 45:59)
go once everyone was in it didn't the (45:55 - 46:01)
overall feel of the park didn't feel (45:59 - 46:05)
crowded now it felt like the amount of (46:01 - 46:07)
people they reserved and the park size (46:05 - 46:10)
they reserved felt comfortable and (46:07 - 46:12)
another thing that when John Hanke came (46:10 - 46:14)
out he said you know we were expecting (46:12 - 46:18)
rain all week and so far it's showing to (46:14 - 46:20)
be a beautiful day and it was at that (46:18 - 46:23)
moment beautiful and then about ten (46:20 - 46:25)
minutes later it just turned into like a (46:23 - 46:29)
heat wave yeah yeah significant but but (46:25 - 46:31)
also the thing that I noted when Micah (46:29 - 46:35)
finally got in was the line to get out (46:31 - 46:38)
yes not only the line to get out but (46:35 - 46:41)
also the line to the information booth (46:38 - 46:45)
with it was super long and all people (46:41 - 46:47)
who had their QR codes in their hands (46:45 - 46:49)
and looked very frustrated this is like (46:47 - 46:51)
this is jumping a little head but when (46:49 - 46:53)
in the media tent when we were talk (46:51 - 46:56)
to the producer who was probably (46:53 - 46:58)
extremely communicative he was like I (46:56 - 46:59)
don't care if you record me I don't care (46:58 - 47:02)
if you write down what I say we're (46:59 - 47:03)
giving you the information to (47:02 - 47:06)
communicate with your fan bases or with (47:03 - 47:08)
other people like that's why you guys (47:06 - 47:10)
are here to communicate our message yeah (47:08 - 47:13)
he said less than 4% of people actually (47:10 - 47:18)
had QR code issues okay way is that what (47:13 - 47:20)
he said yeah it was a real soft talker (47:18 - 47:23)
and there were some people behind me who (47:20 - 47:25)
were talking loud so I did miss some (47:23 - 47:27)
points but also we should explain to (47:25 - 47:30)
people who weren't there the QR code (47:27 - 47:33)
basically what happened is when you got (47:30 - 47:35)
into the park you would go to one of (47:33 - 47:38)
those special pokey stops spin it it (47:35 - 47:42)
opened up a QR scanner in Pokemon Go app (47:38 - 47:45)
when you scanned your QR code or (47:42 - 47:48)
tattooed him or typed in the number sure (47:45 - 47:52)
that is what basically turned on pokey (47:48 - 47:55)
got Pokemon go fest in your app and made (47:52 - 47:59)
you able to see all the special stuff (47:55 - 48:01)
that was happening inside the park so (47:59 - 48:03)
that people who were just walking around (48:01 - 48:06)
outside the park didn't see the special (48:03 - 48:08)
spawns or anything like that because (48:06 - 48:11)
they hadn't registered the QR code so I (48:08 - 48:13)
know a lot of people were aggravated (48:11 - 48:15)
because they're like I'm in but I'm (48:13 - 48:19)
still not able to do Pokemon go fests (48:15 - 48:20)
because I can't even spin app okay stop (48:19 - 48:24)
and scan my QR code I think the Oh mom (48:20 - 48:24)
actually (48:24 - 48:27)
yeah my mom's significant my mom ran it (48:24 - 48:30)
at all I think though overall the QR (48:27 - 48:33)
code was a smart system oh oh yeah (48:30 - 48:35)
absolutely if it had worked if it was (48:33 - 48:37)
lawless it would thing to do yeah I (48:35 - 48:38)
don't know I think less than four (48:37 - 48:42)
percent is pretty okay and I'm sure most (48:38 - 48:44)
of those it's not so much the issue that (48:42 - 48:46)
you couldn't scan the QR code it's that (48:44 - 48:47)
you couldn't get into the game they're (48:46 - 48:49)
just scan the QR code yeah because there (48:47 - 48:52)
was a there was a point where I couldn't (48:49 - 48:53)
even launch the game anymore (48:52 - 48:56)
yep and I I couldn't even tell if it was (48:53 - 48:58)
like okay I'm on AT&T Wi-Fi it's been (48:56 - 48:59)
working all day why isn't it working now (48:58 - 49:02)
you're so bad for you guys I don't even (48:59 - 49:04)
I don't even remember the first (49:02 - 49:07)
challenge because as soon as John Hanke (49:04 - 49:10)
got off stage because he kicked off like (49:07 - 49:12)
get ready for the first challenge and he (49:10 - 49:14)
I think he kind of explained what it was (49:12 - 49:14)
about (49:14 - 49:17)
everyone kind of walked away from that (49:14 - 49:22)
stage of like okay we'll try all right (49:17 - 49:26)
the first challenge was to catch as many (49:22 - 49:31)
normal rock electric grass fire and (49:26 - 49:34)
water pokemon as possible but that's (49:31 - 49:36)
that was the whole challenge that that (49:34 - 49:38)
was no that was the first challenge I (49:36 - 49:40)
think they originally were all supposed (49:38 - 49:42)
to be different but because of the (49:40 - 49:45)
issues they just kept it the same and (49:42 - 49:47)
there were there was a meter that yes on (49:45 - 49:50)
this screen on the stage and us and they (49:47 - 49:51)
were also in the tents if you walked (49:50 - 49:53)
into the tent the meters were there too (49:51 - 49:56)
but but also which I don't know if this (49:53 - 49:58)
is jumping ahead but they also had LEDs (49:56 - 50:00)
screens like in front outside of each of (49:58 - 50:02)
the tents I don't know if you notice cuz (50:00 - 50:04)
they didn't turn them on but I think (50:02 - 50:07)
those were supposed to track like how (50:04 - 50:10)
well each of the teams we're doing I see (50:07 - 50:13)
and like the meters would show oh you (50:10 - 50:16)
know team instinct is has caught the (50:13 - 50:19)
most fire pokemon and is leading this at (50:16 - 50:21)
one point before you guys got when when (50:19 - 50:24)
it was only like sprint early customers (50:21 - 50:26)
got in inside the tents there were (50:24 - 50:29)
meters and there were leaderboards yeah (50:26 - 50:33)
of being like a pit bull dog mom it has (50:29 - 50:35)
hatched the most eggs on insult I saw (50:33 - 50:39)
mom I saw a guy who had won a bunch of (50:35 - 50:41)
medals and like literally he had five (50:39 - 50:43)
medals at the team in sync tent for (50:41 - 50:46)
being like the team instinct player who (50:43 - 50:48)
caught the most fire pokemon and and (50:46 - 50:50)
like different things like that which is (50:48 - 50:52)
like becomes really dubious it's like (50:50 - 50:56)
yeah else could play ways but also one (50:52 - 50:57)
thing of just about this setup that I (50:56 - 51:01)
wanted to say was I was very impressed (50:57 - 51:03)
with how they did the physical setup (51:01 - 51:07)
like the tents themselves the equipment (51:03 - 51:10)
they brought the like little pokey stop (51:07 - 51:11)
models that they set up in it (51:10 - 51:14)
none of it looked cheap no right it (51:11 - 51:16)
looked like they had really put a lot (51:14 - 51:18)
into that physical structure and they (51:16 - 51:21)
had huge like (51:18 - 51:24)
photo stations where it was like a phone (51:21 - 51:28)
and the screen was like clear like clear (51:24 - 51:31)
glass with an overlay of like a Snorlax (51:28 - 51:33)
or something and you could stand behind (51:31 - 51:35)
it and I get a picture so it looked like (51:33 - 51:37)
you were in in the phone there's a (51:35 - 51:39)
picture of me with a cyndaquil in one of (51:37 - 51:41)
those pretty good I wanted to ask (51:39 - 51:46)
anybody that was playing before we got (51:41 - 51:48)
in and we couldn't get any service there (51:46 - 51:50)
were specific stations throughout the (51:48 - 51:53)
entire park where it was like this is (51:50 - 51:56)
the symbol for rock pokémon this is the (51:53 - 51:59)
symbol for electric-type yeah was that (51:56 - 52:02)
supposed to be like specific like rock (51:59 - 52:04)
pokémon would spawn there so electric (52:02 - 52:07)
pokemon there never activate I think so (52:04 - 52:09)
because what I was saying earlier that (52:07 - 52:11)
by the media tent we were getting the (52:09 - 52:14)
same Pokemon yeah like man Chomp man (52:11 - 52:18)
jumpin teddiursa teddiursa and snubbull (52:14 - 52:21)
what if I wanted different Pokemon I (52:18 - 52:23)
would before the server's went down if I (52:21 - 52:25)
walk to a different end of the park I (52:23 - 52:28)
was seeing different Pokemon yeah so I (52:25 - 52:30)
think it was designed to set up like (52:28 - 52:32)
you're always going to get at least (52:30 - 52:34)
Magikarp here you're always gonna get at (52:32 - 52:36)
least Geodude here which is really nice (52:34 - 52:39)
for people who hey I've never seen a (52:36 - 52:41)
Geodude I know at this end of the park (52:39 - 52:42)
this is where the Geodude are I can go (52:41 - 52:44)
get them and my phone doesn't connect (52:42 - 52:49)
now sinned in mind yeah never at any (52:44 - 52:53)
point until a little bit later did I (52:49 - 52:56)
have service really I I had it for maybe (52:53 - 52:58)
just a moment when we got in we were by (52:56 - 53:00)
the media tent I was able to catch a (52:58 - 53:03)
hair cross and from that point forward (53:00 - 53:06)
it was impossible for me to get service (53:03 - 53:09)
I at all I would say the worst was your (53:06 - 53:14)
wife who wouldn't get on the game (53:09 - 53:17)
download the app dude she had to use my (53:14 - 53:21)
phone and a horn it still was crashing (53:17 - 53:24)
so constantly she would get in find a (53:21 - 53:28)
Pokemon throw a Pokeball and it would (53:24 - 53:30)
just crash even before that happened (53:28 - 53:32)
sometimes she would just get into the (53:30 - 53:35)
game tap something and it would crash (53:32 - 53:38)
I left Mitch MidFirst challenge because (53:35 - 53:41)
I looked at the leaderboard and the bars (53:38 - 53:43)
weren't moving oh yeah and no one had (53:41 - 53:46)
any enthusiasm to complete the challenge (53:43 - 53:47)
mostly because they couldn't connect so (53:46 - 53:49)
I left I went back to my car I got my (53:47 - 53:53)
computer and I was like I'm just gonna (53:49 - 53:58)
upload the video of people of John Hanke (53:53 - 54:00)
coming out on stage because people were (53:58 - 54:02)
asking specifically for that and I (54:00 - 54:05)
wanted this is the first time I was (54:02 - 54:06)
using this video camera so I was like (54:05 - 54:07)
well if I'm gonna continue using this (54:06 - 54:10)
video camera I might as well look so I (54:07 - 54:13)
walked in my car got my computer went to (54:10 - 54:16)
a Starbucks I tethered my phone started (54:13 - 54:18)
I quickly edited a two-minute video it (54:16 - 54:21)
was like chop attempt to edit sound (54:18 - 54:23)
because that's just like destroyed (54:21 - 54:27)
everything sound wise and so I quickly (54:23 - 54:29)
uploaded it and then while I was there (54:27 - 54:31)
at the Starbucks there was a bunch of (54:29 - 54:34)
people with wristbands the the Pokemon (54:31 - 54:36)
girl wristbands and so while I was (54:34 - 54:39)
waiting for the upload somebody asked me (54:36 - 54:41)
what I was was doing because they saw (54:39 - 54:42)
all this equipment out on the Starbucks (54:41 - 54:45)
table and I was like oh I just uploading (54:42 - 54:47)
some video of the Pokemon go of it and (54:45 - 54:49)
they're like oh are you a reporter and I (54:47 - 54:51)
was like no no I just do a podcast and (54:49 - 54:52)
then I had to explain what a podcast was (54:51 - 54:56)
but these two older women came in and (54:52 - 54:58)
they were also talking to me and they (54:56 - 55:00)
were they had the go-fast and I was like (54:58 - 55:03)
oh did you did you guys have any luck at (55:00 - 55:05)
the fest and they were like no not at (55:03 - 55:08)
all this is terrible I was like oh (55:05 - 55:10)
that's a bummer they were like we flew (55:08 - 55:11)
all the way from California to come like (55:10 - 55:13)
we love Pokemon go and oh that's really (55:11 - 55:16)
cool and I noticed they had four phones (55:13 - 55:19)
and they were like not we we're on 18 I (55:16 - 55:21)
asked I was like what service provider (55:19 - 55:22)
on you because I'm on ATT they were like (55:21 - 55:24)
we're on 18 T we couldn't connect and I (55:22 - 55:26)
was like oh yeah 100% the same and they (55:24 - 55:29)
said we walked over to the Sprint store (55:26 - 55:31)
and bought sprint phones because they (55:29 - 55:35)
were $100 and we want to make the most (55:31 - 55:37)
of this event so another hundred dollars (55:35 - 55:39)
isn't that big of a deal because we (55:37 - 55:41)
already spent like a thousand dollars to (55:39 - 55:45)
get here yeah and Sprint assured us that (55:41 - 55:48)
we would be able to play on Sprint (55:45 - 55:49)
because their sponsor of the event and (55:48 - 55:51)
they have everything taken care of and (55:49 - 55:53)
so they bought sprint phones with sprint (55:51 - 55:56)
phone numbers to log in and they're like (55:53 - 55:58)
we can't we can't even log in sprint (55:56 - 56:01)
doesn't work either wow that's rough but (55:58 - 56:04)
as I said multiple times throughout the (56:01 - 56:08)
day right like I know what a cell on (56:04 - 56:10)
wheels a site on wheels looks like (56:08 - 56:12)
because I have brought them into (56:10 - 56:16)
Georgetown and I did not see a single (56:12 - 56:19)
one on the outside of the park or on the (56:16 - 56:22)
inside of the park so there was they (56:19 - 56:23)
were not doing anything to augment (56:22 - 56:26)
signal at one point though I pointed (56:23 - 56:28)
that that's where they I went and looked (56:26 - 56:30)
at them those were bolted into the (56:28 - 56:32)
ground it's all a like hang lights and (56:30 - 56:35)
sound equipment for the stage so they (56:32 - 56:38)
looked like a portable Tower yeah ever (56:35 - 56:40)
but I guess they weren't I was when I (56:38 - 56:42)
was walking back so many people were (56:40 - 56:45)
just pouring out of the park leaving and (56:42 - 56:50)
it's only one o'clock now yeah about get (56:45 - 56:52)
back into the park and there what you (56:50 - 56:54)
guys said earlier there there's zero (56:52 - 56:56)
line to get into the park and there's a (56:54 - 56:58)
mile long line to get out of the park (56:56 - 57:00)
because they need to deactivate your (56:58 - 57:04)
wristband properly yeah oh yeah so back (57:00 - 57:07)
in so people understand there was an NFC (57:04 - 57:12)
chip in every wristband that you had to (57:07 - 57:14)
like place against a reader when you (57:12 - 57:16)
walked in and it bleeps green so they (57:14 - 57:18)
knew you were in there you had to do the (57:16 - 57:21)
same thing when you walked out or you (57:18 - 57:23)
could not get back in which I don't (57:21 - 57:26)
understand why but when we left they (57:23 - 57:28)
also stamped your hand yeah because all (57:26 - 57:33)
the technology was family oh you know (57:28 - 57:35)
what I actually know why I didn't even (57:33 - 57:38)
think about it when we came back in and (57:35 - 57:41)
we they scanned us to get back in there (57:38 - 57:43)
were people still there with the QR (57:41 - 57:46)
codes handing them out and said I'll (57:43 - 57:48)
take a QR code and the guy handing them (57:46 - 57:51)
out said I see the stamp on your hand (57:48 - 57:55)
you're not getting another one okay (57:51 - 57:57)
that's actually really smart it's like (57:55 - 57:59)
this is the the bump this is the (57:57 - 58:01)
disappointing thing about the event (57:59 - 58:03)
almost everything was pretty well (58:01 - 58:07)
thought out yeah getting in how the park (58:03 - 58:10)
was set up where to go like the state I (58:07 - 58:10)
don't I (58:10 - 58:14)
Irene did you see even mystic 7 come out (58:10 - 58:16)

hours but that was that was the big (58:16 - 58:21)
celebrity there no not from what I could (58:19 - 58:24)
see I don't think so but we saw him (58:21 - 58:28)
about the introductions yeah but so the (58:24 - 58:29)
only people that were out on the stage (58:28 - 58:32)
itself because I think they did I felt (58:29 - 58:34)
like no one came out ever the only (58:32 - 58:35)
people that I saw on stage was John (58:34 - 58:38)
Hagee and (58:35 - 58:41)
Lindsay yeah good ol Lindsay oh that (58:38 - 58:45)

will be on a separate podcast I don't I (59:21 - 59:25)
I shouldn't say that because I haven't (59:24 - 59:27)
listened to the audio so I don't know (59:25 - 59:30)
how so just to mention trainer tips cuz (59:27 - 59:32)
I don't think you were around to see (59:30 - 59:34)
this but Irene I think you were with me (59:32 - 59:36)
it's like the we're doing like the (59:34 - 59:39)
second big everybody come to the concert (59:36 - 59:41)
platform and we're gonna do an (59:39 - 59:43)
announcement and they're like and we're (59:41 - 59:45)
gonna show this video from trainer tips (59:43 - 59:50)
and it started to play and the video was (59:45 - 59:53)
fine and the audio was incredibly (59:50 - 59:56)
distorted so they only got to play about (59:53 - 59:59)
a minute a half of it and they stopped (59:56 - 60:02)
it weird and I could I didn't see it but (59:59 - 60:04)
I could hear the audio but at some point (60:02 - 60:05)
I guess they fixed it because they (60:04 - 60:08)
probably the entire thing I didn't see (60:05 - 60:10)
yet but I was just thinking like cuz I (60:08 - 60:14)
do these kinds of events right and AV is (60:10 - 60:17)
always so tricky and I'm just amazed (60:14 - 60:19)
that they did not have that on 100% (60:17 - 60:23)
lockdown that that could not go wrong (60:19 - 60:24)
the way that it did because that was (60:23 - 60:27)
just like everybody was so excited we're (60:24 - 60:29)
gonna have a trainer tips video trainer (60:27 - 60:32)
tips is here and then it was like (60:29 - 60:37)
playing crash it came it was I believe a (60:32 - 60:40)
video about competitive gym battling (60:37 - 60:43)
what's the okay I think when they played (60:40 - 60:45)
it actually was when we were split up (60:43 - 60:49)
and because I remember hearing the audio (60:45 - 60:51)
for it but we weren't over (60:49 - 60:54)
by the area at that time so when they (60:51 - 60:56)
replayed it like I think I heard some of (60:54 - 60:59)
the audio and I was thinking that we (60:56 - 61:00)
should go back but then it was kind of (60:59 - 61:02)
like whatever I'd rather go to the (61:00 - 61:05)
bathroom Irene you were probably in the (61:02 - 61:07)
park more than at one point I thought (61:05 - 61:08)
you guys were all had at working because (61:07 - 61:10)
I was like where where is everyone and (61:08 - 61:12)
you said you were at stop eight or (61:10 - 61:15)
something on the there's like inside the (61:12 - 61:17)
park there was the main stage with the (61:15 - 61:18)
three tents and then there was like this (61:17 - 61:21)
open field of muddy grass and then there (61:18 - 61:23)
was like this more beautiful park on the (61:21 - 61:25)
other side which were like the street (61:23 - 61:28)
divided yeah and so you guys were over (61:25 - 61:30)
there and I was like oh cool it sounds (61:28 - 61:31)
like things are working now cuz it's (61:30 - 61:34)
what was that two o'clock and so I (61:31 - 61:36)
walked out I walked over there couldn't (61:34 - 61:38)
find you but did you guys walk and hit (61:36 - 61:40)
all the stops and actually catch pokemon (61:38 - 61:42)
at that point it was still I was so in (61:40 - 61:45)
and out I don't I think the best service (61:42 - 61:49)
I ended up getting was actually after we (61:45 - 61:53)
left for the day but at that time for me (61:49 - 61:58)
it was working fine I was able to catch (61:53 - 62:01)
and unknown at some point when we were (61:58 - 62:03)
over there in that corner (62:01 - 62:07)
you wanna speaking of a known unknown do (62:03 - 62:09)
you want to tell them what the unknown (62:07 - 62:11)
spelled or like what kind of unknowns (62:09 - 62:16)
there were Irene's counting with her (62:11 - 62:19)
fingers right now I think there were (62:16 - 62:21)
five six six there are six I don't know (62:19 - 62:26)
how to spell they had a C and H and I AG (62:21 - 62:31)
in a and then oh and it's spelled ACOG (62:26 - 62:35)
oh whoa when you needed another C yeah (62:31 - 62:40)
yeah yeah I think all of us I'm looking (62:35 - 62:44)
away from Steve all of us got all the (62:40 - 62:46)
available letters I could spell Chicago (62:44 - 62:52)
like three times on his face we didn't (62:46 - 62:55)
realize it spelled Chicago until I (62:52 - 62:58)
realized him as as I was leaving for the (62:55 - 63:00)
day yeah when I was still in the media (62:58 - 63:01)
tent we were all talking about the (63:00 - 63:03)
unknowns we caught and then it was like (63:01 - 63:05)
oh I think it's Belichick (63:03 - 63:08)
go and cuz at some point people were (63:05 - 63:12)
saying oh I caught a Z but yeah yes and (63:08 - 63:14)
I and I was confused cuz I caught a C (63:12 - 63:17)
and Irene told me it was an e so I was (63:14 - 63:22)
like no I haven't when I told you Micah (63:17 - 63:23)
at dinner I was like hey you know it (63:22 - 63:25)
spelled Chicago and you're like oh I (63:23 - 63:26)
want the rest of the letters well (63:25 - 63:28)
because at that point I was like if it's (63:26 - 63:31)
random and it's just any of the 26 I'm (63:28 - 63:34)
not gonna try and catch all 26 hear what (63:31 - 63:38)
they have had all 28 if only 26 and the (63:34 - 63:41)
gamut is yes because the exclamation (63:38 - 63:43)
mark and the question are we are (63:41 - 63:45)
generation 3 yep which we're in the (63:43 - 63:47)
original image so if you look at the (63:45 - 63:49)
original image I think you can use that (63:47 - 63:51)
as a really good basis for future images (63:49 - 63:54)
of they showed heracross and they showed (63:51 - 63:57)
unknown and those were the two rare (63:54 - 64:00)
Pokemon at the event the only two rare (63:57 - 64:01)
Pokemon and they were spawning pretty (64:00 - 64:04)
frequently and I think that's fine uh I (64:01 - 64:06)
don't know Irene what do you what did (64:04 - 64:09)
you think of like only having those two (64:06 - 64:11)
rare Pokemon I was expecting them to (64:09 - 64:15)
have more uh but again I don't really (64:11 - 64:18)
know what I mean like that $25 is fine (64:15 - 64:20)
to guarantee that you're walking out (64:18 - 64:23)
with Pokemon you can only get in Brazil (64:20 - 64:25)
and the southern tip of Florida and in (64:23 - 64:29)
Mexico and the rarest Pokemon in the (64:25 - 64:31)
game right now which is unknown yeah I (64:29 - 64:34)
would say I think at that point for a (64:31 - 64:36)
lot of people it was like I just want (64:34 - 64:40)
these two Pokemon so I can leave (64:36 - 64:40)
actually said I would really only be (64:41 - 64:45)
happy at that point if I could catch (64:44 - 64:47)
I had already caught a hair cross I just (64:45 - 64:49)
wanted to catch an unknown I didn't (64:47 - 64:52)
catch one until after we left at like 7 (64:49 - 64:54)
o'clock that's the other thing is when I (64:52 - 64:56)
got back after uploading the video we (64:54 - 64:58)
got another producer meeting for the in (64:56 - 65:01)
the media tent I mean I probably get my (64:58 - 65:02)
time's wrong but this was the meeting (65:01 - 65:04)
where it was just to let you know (65:02 - 65:06)
everything is still planned for the rest (65:04 - 65:09)
of the day the mystery event aka the (65:06 - 65:11)
legendary event is still planned for 6 (65:09 - 65:13)
o'clock we're still going to go through (65:11 - 65:16)
all the challenges we're still working (65:13 - 65:18)
to get the cell providers up we're still (65:16 - 65:19)
work (65:18 - 65:22)
hang on the game so you know just go (65:19 - 65:24)
through as normal we understand that (65:22 - 65:25)
this is really frustrating we're still (65:24 - 65:27)
planned for the rest of the day though (65:25 - 65:29)
and then the next conversation we had (65:27 - 65:32)
with the producer was what we're doing (65:29 - 65:34)
now is we are extending heracross and (65:32 - 65:37)
unknown in a two mile radius outside of (65:34 - 65:38)
Chicago (65:37 - 65:40)
well the way he put it was they're (65:38 - 65:42)
extending everything for the go-fast (65:40 - 65:46)
yeah whatever apply let's be honest (65:42 - 65:48)
people only cared about unknown and (65:46 - 65:50)
heracross at that but also the spinners (65:48 - 65:53)
the pokey stops that let you scan the QR (65:50 - 65:55)
you're right people were having trouble (65:53 - 65:57)
scanning the QR codes there so they (65:55 - 65:59)
could go outside the event and scan it (65:57 - 66:01)
any of the stops oh I didn't know that (65:59 - 66:03)
yeah it's kind of nice (66:01 - 66:08)
they also I believe extended the range (66:03 - 66:11)
for what activated the to hatch eggs so (66:08 - 66:14)
it made hatching them faster yeah the (66:11 - 66:16)
distance for 2k eggs ended up being (66:14 - 66:20)
point-to-point seven kilometers but I'm (66:16 - 66:23)
pretty sure that that was because there (66:20 - 66:26)
were three tiers for the challenge (66:23 - 66:29)
it was bronze silver and gold and gold (66:26 - 66:31)
was the one that unlocked the mystery (66:29 - 66:33)
challenge or whatever but I actually (66:31 - 66:35)
wanted to mention I don't think if any (66:33 - 66:37)
of you saw it I'm also not sure if it's (66:35 - 66:42)
real but um apparently they changed the (66:37 - 66:44)
numbers the milestone numbers for each (66:42 - 66:48)
tier because I wasn't working and it was (66:44 - 66:49)
up on a screen and someone got a picture (66:48 - 66:53)
of it oh I'm changing the numbers I saw (66:49 - 66:56)
it on slack but I'm not sure we talked (66:53 - 66:58)
about the the raids real quick because (66:56 - 67:01)
what was really cool and this was before (66:58 - 67:04)
the disappointment set in is at about (67:01 - 67:07)
9:45 they were Pikachu raids there were (67:04 - 67:09)
three Pikachu raids and they were 15 (67:07 - 67:11)
minutes long and I was like I think all (67:09 - 67:13)
of the raids were 15 yeah all the Razr (67:11 - 67:15)
which was really smart to be like okay (67:13 - 67:18)
15 minutes you know get 20 people every (67:15 - 67:19)
one of these raids will be accomplished (67:18 - 67:22)
because of how many people are there (67:19 - 67:23)
yeah minus the fact that nothing works (67:22 - 67:25)
so none of them were accomplished yet (67:23 - 67:27)
but there were Pikachu raids and I was (67:25 - 67:30)
like this is really cool we've never (67:27 - 67:32)
gotten a Pikachu raid it's probably just (67:30 - 67:33)
a normal (67:32 - 67:37)
breathtaking Pikachu but it because now (67:33 - 67:39)
Pokemon go shows you what ball you (67:37 - 67:41)
caught it in it would be really cool to (67:39 - 67:43)
go oh look at this Pikachu it's in a (67:41 - 67:44)
premier ball which means I did a raid (67:43 - 67:47)
that was only at this event like it is (67:44 - 67:51)
another quote-unquote hat Pikachu except (67:47 - 67:52)
now it's like a ball peeking it's just (67:51 - 67:54)
cool it would have been cool to do but (67:52 - 67:56)
nothing of that worked and I know I did (67:54 - 67:58)
see like Tyranitar raids and stuff pop (67:56 - 68:01)
up but it was outside the HMT range that (67:58 - 68:03)
I was getting serviced in but that was (68:01 - 68:05)
that was pretty much for the raids we (68:03 - 68:08)
get another chat with a producer this (68:05 - 68:11)
point it's I'm kind of jumping at all (68:08 - 68:14)
I'll jump ahead but pretty much neotec (68:11 - 68:17)
came out on stage jatt and John Hanke (68:14 - 68:20)
what let me back up again John Hanke was (68:17 - 68:24)
out there all day oh yeah yeah and you (68:20 - 68:28)
can boo that the games aren't working (68:24 - 68:32)
you can chant fix the servers they don't (68:28 - 68:34)
need to hear that they know right (68:32 - 68:38)
they're not unaware of what there's (68:34 - 68:41)
no-one at nee antic wanted this event to (68:38 - 68:43)
fail I actually said when we were (68:41 - 68:45)
walking Becky and I were walking through (68:43 - 68:48)
the muddy field and we were both very (68:45 - 68:49)
disappointed and she looked even more (68:48 - 68:52)
disappointed because she just wanted to (68:49 - 68:54)
she couldn't even get into the like yeah (68:52 - 68:57)
it was just crashing constantly I said I (68:54 - 69:01)
do kind of feel bad for everybody that (68:57 - 69:04)
was planning this because it looks like (69:01 - 69:07)
looking across the park from that field (69:04 - 69:09)
everything was so incredibly well (69:07 - 69:12)
thought out like the station's looked (69:09 - 69:14)
cool the like spawn point stations (69:12 - 69:16)
looked like they would have been cool (69:14 - 69:19)
everybody looked like they thought this (69:16 - 69:21)
was good and thinking about the trailer (69:19 - 69:22)
that we watched the night before like (69:21 - 69:24)
they really thought this was gonna be a (69:22 - 69:27)
super fun event yeah and I can't imagine (69:24 - 69:30)
the heartbreak behind the scenes when (69:27 - 69:33)
you're like oh it's actually a disaster (69:30 - 69:34)
but you know it's even better right (69:33 - 69:38)
because this is somebody's job right (69:34 - 69:42)
they put a lot of work into it as their (69:38 - 69:44)
job and they're like I'm working really (69:42 - 69:47)
hard probably people working overtime (69:44 - 69:49)
making sure like I'm gonna make sure (69:47 - 69:51)
this is the best event ever and you know (69:49 - 69:53)
what's gonna happen tomorrow they're (69:51 - 69:56)
gonna get yelled at yeah and it's like I (69:53 - 69:58)
put in all that extra work something (69:56 - 70:02)
broke and now I'm gonna get my bulbasaur (69:58 - 70:04)
handed to me here here's the thing knee (70:02 - 70:06)
antic has done dozens of these events (70:04 - 70:09)
all over the world before for ingress (70:06 - 70:10)
yes (70:09 - 70:12)
so John Hanke specifically said when I (70:10 - 70:14)
was because I got to talk to John Hanke (70:12 - 70:17)
for a little bit the person I think it (70:14 - 70:18)
might actually been Allegro that was in (70:17 - 70:20)
front of me and I forget what question (70:18 - 70:23)
she she asked but the response was we (70:20 - 70:26)
just had an event in Japan for ingress (70:23 - 70:29)
that was 10,000 people that worked (70:26 - 70:32)
flawlessly and so if you're in the attic (70:29 - 70:34)
and you do the math okay just double (70:32 - 70:36)
everything we did there we're gonna (70:34 - 70:39)
bring 20,000 people instead of 10,000 so (70:36 - 70:40)
this is what we have at the event just (70:39 - 70:43)
double that that double devil doesn't (70:40 - 70:49)
work if you want your steak cooked (70:43 - 70:51)
faster you just increase the temperature (70:49 - 70:55)
half the time oh yeah here's a trick (70:51 - 70:59)
kids if you want more Wi-Fi doubling the (70:55 - 71:01)
number of access points doubles the (70:59 - 71:03)
amount of interference between those two (71:01 - 71:05)
access points there it is doesn't work (71:03 - 71:08)
lane side tips but they've proven that (71:05 - 71:10)
they can do big events like yes between (71:08 - 71:13)
his announcements that he did he was (71:10 - 71:16)
literally sitting on stage all day just (71:13 - 71:18)
talking to fans and talking to people (71:16 - 71:22)
and that's so respectable yes so like a (71:18 - 71:26)
lot of people would hide behind the (71:22 - 71:29)
curtain or be back there yelling at (71:26 - 71:31)
their employees like fix this and even I (71:29 - 71:33)
heard him say at one point all this (71:31 - 71:36)
technical stuff I don't understand so I (71:33 - 71:38)
trust my team that they're doing the (71:36 - 71:39)
best work that they can do there's (71:38 - 71:41)
nothing more I can say what a humble (71:39 - 71:44)
slam against his team is well I didn't (71:41 - 71:48)
know anything go back there and tell (71:44 - 71:52)
them fix the internet they know I (71:48 - 71:56)
definitely have a lot of respect for (71:52 - 71:58)
that guy after yesterday after seeing (71:56 - 72:01)
him like sitting on the stage and (71:58 - 72:02)
talking to people and being involved (72:01 - 72:04)
when it was a mess and trying to like (72:02 - 72:07)
like boots on the ground talk to people (72:04 - 72:09)
who were upset and try and make them (72:07 - 72:12)
feel better about it even though it (72:09 - 72:15)
didn't really help too much I think it (72:12 - 72:17)
was cool I think it helped for those (72:15 - 72:19)
people that took the time to meet him (72:17 - 72:21)
yeah I think it some people I mean (72:19 - 72:23)
didn't help in terms of like the service (72:21 - 72:26)
didn't get any better yeah but yeah so (72:23 - 72:29)
long story short pretty much they were (72:26 - 72:31)
not able to solve the problem within the (72:29 - 72:35)
time frame of the park I think it was (72:31 - 72:37)
about 4:30 when they decided to throw in (72:35 - 72:40)
the towel completely on it so they (72:37 - 72:41)
announced this earlier but I'm just (72:40 - 72:42)
gonna sum it up all in one because (72:41 - 72:44)
pretty much they repeated the same thing (72:42 - 72:47)
at 4:30 with the with the addition of (72:44 - 72:49)
we're kind of done for the day (72:47 - 72:52)
yes exactly but the John Hanke came out (72:49 - 72:55)
in the afternoon and the first thing he (72:52 - 72:58)
said is we understand this was before (72:55 - 73:00)
they threw in the towel but we (72:58 - 73:03)
understand that we're still having (73:00 - 73:05)
connectivity issues we are still working (73:03 - 73:07)
extremely hard to fix it as fast as (73:05 - 73:09)
possible but what we're going to do is (73:07 - 73:11)
we're going to refund to everyone's (73:09 - 73:14)
ticket to get in and the crowd erupted (73:11 - 73:15)
of in Cheers (73:14 - 73:16)
they're very excited for this and I was (73:15 - 73:20)
like you know that's it's really humble (73:16 - 73:22)
like to me if they didn't refund the (73:20 - 73:25)
ticket me walking away with one unknown (73:22 - 73:29)
and one heracross and meeting all the (73:25 - 73:31)
people there like that was worth it to (73:29 - 73:32)
me (73:31 - 73:37)
I was pretty consistently like this is (73:32 - 73:40)
not worth it to me and I was prepared to (73:37 - 73:42)
put up a fight to get a refund for my (73:40 - 73:44)
shirt sure see I wasn't I wasn't in that (73:42 - 73:46)
boat Irene you didn't pay any money (73:44 - 73:48)
because I bought your ticket but how did (73:46 - 73:51)
you feel at that point I thought it was (73:48 - 73:53)
smart I felt really bad for the people (73:51 - 73:56)
that went in spent all their like they (73:53 - 73:58)
bought their tickets off eBay and stuff (73:56 - 74:00)
because it looks like well that sucks (73:58 - 74:03)
alright I don't necessarily feel it but (74:00 - 74:06)
Irene you and I saw I'm thinking you (74:03 - 74:08)
were with me this one guy who was just (74:06 - 74:14)
like furious and he said I spent 300 (74:08 - 74:17)
on my ticket I took off work today I'm (74:14 - 74:21)
gonna lose 250 dollars for my work and I (74:17 - 74:24)
paid so much for the parking and these (74:21 - 74:26)
people are messing me over and (74:24 - 74:27)
everything and I was thinking to myself (74:26 - 74:30)
it's like these are all choices you made (74:27 - 74:35)
it was a $30 ticket or you know what (74:30 - 74:38)
nine hour event yeah I still feel bad (74:35 - 74:41)
though I mean I have a hard time feeling (74:38 - 74:43)
bad for people who paid scalper prices (74:41 - 74:45)
but I mean more like the people that (74:43 - 74:48)
were the people that traveled yeah that (74:45 - 74:50)
I totally definitely I mean they like (74:48 - 74:52)
you said there was somebody who flew all (74:50 - 74:53)
the way from Germany there was a guy I (74:52 - 74:55)
talked to you that came from Brazil and (74:53 - 74:58)
he was actually one of the things he (74:55 - 74:59)
said was he was hoping that when they (74:58 - 75:02)
said they teased International Pokemon (74:59 - 75:04)
that there would be more than here he (75:02 - 75:05)
gets her cross where he lives so he (75:04 - 75:08)
didn't care yeah so what kind of what (75:05 - 75:11)
I'm saying is like be mad that are angry (75:08 - 75:15)
because things didn't work out but don't (75:11 - 75:18)
necessarily be mad at Niantic because (75:15 - 75:20)
you spend five hundred and fifty dollars (75:18 - 75:23)
or you decided not to work that day yeah (75:20 - 75:25)
because you didn't work you didn't make (75:23 - 75:26)
two hundred and fifty dollars like (75:25 - 75:29)
that's not the antics problem at all so (75:26 - 75:30)
then the second thing that John Hanke (75:29 - 75:33)
said after the refunds which seemed to (75:30 - 75:35)
go over very well with the audience is (75:33 - 75:37)
that they were going to credit everyone (75:35 - 75:40)
there with a hundred dollars worth of (75:37 - 75:43)
pokey coins in the game I think there (75:40 - 75:45)
was louder cheers yeah that was very (75:43 - 75:48)
very happy so this is kind of where the (75:45 - 75:50)
scalpers get a little bit screwed (75:48 - 75:52)
because when you got the wristband you (75:50 - 75:54)
had to go to Pokemon go live.com slash (75:52 - 75:56)
wristband and you had to register an (75:54 - 75:58)
email address your phone number and then (75:56 - 76:00)
your name um you did this right Maya (75:58 - 76:02)
and so when I did it for will and my mom (76:00 - 76:04)
and Irene I put their email addresses (76:02 - 76:06)
and their phone numbers and then (76:04 - 76:09)
everyone's emergency contact was me not (76:06 - 76:10)
that that mattered because that was only (76:09 - 76:11)
for the kids but you had to fill it out (76:10 - 76:15)
anyways yeah even if you paid $300 for a (76:11 - 76:18)
ticket which you shouldn't have yes (76:15 - 76:22)
you're getting $100 of in-game credit (76:18 - 76:24)
which i think is smart from a marketing (76:22 - 76:25)
aspect because it really doesn't cost (76:24 - 76:28)
them any money but it also ensures that (76:25 - 76:30)
they're hardcore fans 20,000 people that (76:28 - 76:33)
really liked Pokemon go kind of gives (76:30 - 76:35)
them incentive like okay today was a (76:33 - 76:38)
bummer but I have this in-game cash now (76:35 - 76:40)
and that's gonna keep me playing and (76:38 - 76:42)
while there were some people that walked (76:40 - 76:44)
away really angry and no matter what (76:42 - 76:45)
they said what they did I don't think (76:44 - 76:47)
they would have been happy regardless (76:45 - 76:51)
yeah I think those two announcements (76:47 - 76:54)
they're fixed a majority of the day for (76:51 - 76:58)
people yeah yeah yeah I think so I mean (76:54 - 77:01)
not everybody but monk but like I said (76:58 - 77:03)
there was nothing that he could have (77:01 - 77:04)
said that would have made everyone had (77:03 - 77:06)
right but every but I think also the (77:04 - 77:10)
last announcement we got at the press (77:06 - 77:12)
conference also helped a tremendous (77:10 - 77:14)
which was the extension the two-mile (77:12 - 77:19)
exception now the time extension oh yeah (77:14 - 77:21)
so originally so the third part of that (77:19 - 77:24)
was we're finding your tickets we're (77:21 - 77:26)
giving you $100 worth of pokey coins and (77:24 - 77:28)
we're extending the radius for two miles (77:26 - 77:31)
and then when we we had this (77:28 - 77:33)
conversation with the producer at like (77:31 - 77:36)
4:30 yeah it was okay here's what's (77:33 - 77:39)
happening we're pretty much done for the (77:36 - 77:42)
day everyone in the park can continue (77:39 - 77:44)
being in the park till 7:00 the event (77:42 - 77:45)
will still go keep in mind at this point (77:44 - 77:47)
there had been no discussion of the like (77:45 - 77:51)
final big challenges right we we heard (77:47 - 77:53)
around like two o'clock that the final (77:51 - 77:55)
challenge was still scheduled yes (77:53 - 77:56)
you know people can still hang out in (77:55 - 77:58)
the parks you can still enjoy what they (77:56 - 78:01)
can enjoy if they can connect we are (77:58 - 78:04)
going to extend hare cross unknown and (78:01 - 78:06)
the two-mile radius we said earlier (78:04 - 78:09)
until Monday morning which for people (78:06 - 78:12)
who are you know staying in to Chicago (78:09 - 78:14)
Saturday night into Sunday or Sunday (78:12 - 78:16)
into Monday that's really awesome there (78:14 - 78:17)
were a lot of people that left on Friday (78:16 - 78:19)
night or Saturday night I should say (78:17 - 78:22)
which don't get to take advantage of (78:19 - 78:24)
that but if you got your hair across you (78:22 - 78:26)
got your unknown it's probably I mean (78:24 - 78:28)
just playing the game at that point yeah (78:26 - 78:31)
with those Pokemon this the stops the (78:28 - 78:34)
eggs all that stuff works until Monday (78:31 - 78:35)
morning with the two hour idiots they (78:34 - 78:39)
also said we're cancelling the six (78:35 - 78:41)
o'clock challenge it was supposed to be (78:39 - 78:42)
lugia (78:41 - 78:44)
which was actually surprised I thought (78:42 - 78:46)
it was good to be Mewtwo yeah I thought (78:44 - 78:48)
for sure like I thought it was a given (78:46 - 78:50)
it was gonna be me too but Luke yes cool (78:48 - 78:52)
yeah Lukey is cool I was surprised how (78:50 - 78:54)
many people cannot say lugia right I (78:52 - 78:56)
shouldn't be talking as somebody who (78:54 - 78:58)
butchers Pokemon names but but even even (78:56 - 79:01)
the producer of the event mispronounced (78:58 - 79:04)
it yeah he called it Lucia (79:01 - 79:07)
oh really not lugia yeah that's weird (79:04 - 79:11)
that's a G GG Lu Jia yeah he was so nice (79:07 - 79:13)
though I know that's not like I like (79:11 - 79:16)
when people say Pokemon in my mom what (79:13 - 79:18)
did my mom call sudowoodo your mom (79:16 - 79:20)
called sudowoodo's (79:18 - 79:23)
Scootaloo Scootaloo she also called dodo (79:20 - 79:26)
doot doot doot oh she called Whomper (79:23 - 79:30)
robo call the Whooper Whomper yeah I (79:26 - 79:32)
think she actually nicknamed her Whooper (79:30 - 79:36)
womper alright is also really good I (79:32 - 79:38)
want to get my mom on the show one day (79:36 - 79:41)
she was not having the it should just be (79:38 - 79:44)
an hour of the two of you saying pokemon (79:41 - 79:49)
name oh she called I remember she called (79:44 - 79:52)
Vaporeon Viper man yeah Viper man yeah (79:49 - 79:55)
oh Shareen said she could what she calls (79:52 - 79:57)
I think called Scyther Slytherin and (79:55 - 79:59)
then two seconds later she was like oh (79:57 - 80:00)
no that's from Harry Potter (79:59 - 80:03)
well we were at Target she called (80:00 - 80:06)
Vaporeon vapor man which is really good (80:03 - 80:09)
really good like the best meme these are (80:06 - 80:10)
all good nicknames you can name your (80:09 - 80:13)
Pokemon and then they said they said (80:10 - 80:16)
that lugia was supposed to be the six (80:13 - 80:20)
o'clock and because team mystic won the (80:16 - 80:23)
challenges that Articuno was the other (80:20 - 80:25)
bonus Pokemon for the night there were (80:23 - 80:27)
multiple people when I was walking (80:25 - 80:28)
around at the end of the day that said (80:27 - 80:32)
the reason that mystic one is because (80:28 - 80:35)
the mystic 10th is the only spot in the (80:32 - 80:38)
park that had consistent service and I (80:35 - 80:39)
said there's no way that's true and I (80:38 - 80:42)
went over there instantly I had service (80:39 - 80:44)
in my lab it was in the I was in a (80:42 - 80:47)
Tyranitar raid I caught a Lapras it was (80:44 - 80:49)
yeah in a corner and it was that I think (80:47 - 80:52)
the corner that faces Millennium Park (80:49 - 80:54)
yeah it was the farthest tent away yeah (80:52 - 80:56)
was the mystic see I stopped going to (80:54 - 80:56)
mister (80:56 - 80:58)
because as soon as I got into that open (80:56 - 81:00)
muddy field I didn't have any service (80:58 - 81:02)
you know I had no service on my thumb it (81:00 - 81:04)
was the only spot that was consistently (81:02 - 81:06)
you could get in it I guess about what (81:04 - 81:07)
it kept walking I would have reconnected (81:06 - 81:10)
yeah the other bonus that we didn't (81:07 - 81:13)
mention is that because the legendary (81:10 - 81:15)
raid the six o'clock mystery challenge (81:13 - 81:18)
was cancelled that everyone who scanned (81:15 - 81:21)
a QR code would get lugia in their (81:18 - 81:23)
account for free which is cool which is (81:21 - 81:27)
great but also it's like I just got this (81:23 - 81:29)
I feel like a lot of moments in Pokemon (81:27 - 81:31)
go is like I remember exactly when I got (81:29 - 81:33)
hit my gym I remember my first raid I (81:31 - 81:36)
remember doing a Charizard raid I (81:33 - 81:37)
remember doing a venusaur raid and (81:36 - 81:39)
having old people threaten to call the (81:37 - 81:40)
cops on me because we parked in their (81:39 - 81:41)
parking lot (81:40 - 81:45)
I like remember getting lantern for the (81:41 - 81:46)
first time with Micah when we were on (81:45 - 81:49)
bikes like getting Pokemon at certain (81:46 - 81:53)
points in time or is like the appeal so (81:49 - 81:55)
just to have something appear doesn't (81:53 - 81:58)
feel it's not the same experience and (81:55 - 82:00)
even more than that right people were (81:58 - 82:04)
hyped up by that video yeah I was like (82:00 - 82:07)
we're gonna have 20,000 people right (82:04 - 82:11)
rating simultaneously in Tennessee B so (82:07 - 82:14)
Bob we watched the video and Irene was (82:11 - 82:16)
like this looks so cool I can't wait for (82:14 - 82:18)
this tomorrow and I said I seriously (82:16 - 82:20)
doubt that anybody's gonna be cheering (82:18 - 82:22)
and pumping their fists and she said you (82:20 - 82:29)
don't know just waiting their fists when (82:22 - 82:31)
they got unknown they were hyped all (82:29 - 82:34)
right and by the time I got unknown I (82:31 - 82:41)
was just like finally I can go home and (82:34 - 82:44)
then the the final announcement when the (82:41 - 82:45)
when they were throwing in the towel (82:44 - 82:48)
they were like we're going to roll out (82:45 - 82:51)
legendary raids globally in the next 24 (82:48 - 82:52)
to 48 hours and there were follow-up (82:51 - 82:55)
questions but the the response was this (82:52 - 82:58)
wasn't planned but because of today we (82:55 - 83:00)
just want to get these legendary raids (82:58 - 83:02)
out as soon as possible for people and (83:00 - 83:04)
that's why rolling out globally yep so (83:02 - 83:06)
I'm assuming that there was going to be (83:04 - 83:09)
like a week or two weeks where only (83:06 - 83:10)
people at Pokemon go (83:09 - 83:13)
best had these legendary Pokemon which (83:10 - 83:14)
is fine like a lot of like games do that (83:13 - 83:15)
where it's like oh you were at the event (83:14 - 83:17)
you get this early but we'll give it to (83:15 - 83:18)
everyone eventually it's just this is (83:17 - 83:21)
your little early access bonus yeah when (83:18 - 83:23)
we're leaving the park at 7 it was (83:21 - 83:25)
probably 7:05 in the first raid popped (83:23 - 83:28)
and it was there was no timer to it it (83:25 - 83:30)
just showed up it was lugia and it had a (83:28 - 83:32)
two hour countdown yeah so normally (83:30 - 83:36)
raids have an egg and that egg has a two (83:32 - 83:38)
hour countdown before you see what it is (83:36 - 83:41)
and then you have an hour to complete it (83:38 - 83:44)
yeah this was just lujah spawned and it (83:41 - 83:47)
was two hours and people were losing (83:44 - 83:48)
their minds (83:47 - 83:51)
we were it's like it's like the fest (83:48 - 83:53)
never it's like the fest just started (83:51 - 83:55)
yeah it was like this was the beginning (83:53 - 83:59)
we were on our way to the ISE Meetup and (83:55 - 84:03)
we we saw it your tweet that said this (83:59 - 84:06)
lugia raid popped here and Jeff and I (84:03 - 84:09)
you're literally 15 feet from the door (84:06 - 84:11)
to the restaurant we were there we were (84:09 - 84:14)
there and then we saw the tweet and I (84:11 - 84:17)
was like take my phone let me show the (84:14 - 84:20)
misunderstanding though was when when (84:17 - 84:24)
Jeff saw the tweet he said the loogie (84:20 - 84:27)
array just popped at the vent and I was (84:24 - 84:29)
like what we're going back right it was (84:27 - 84:31)
it's to be fair just so clarification it (84:29 - 84:33)
wasn't at the event it right near the (84:31 - 84:35)
event it was that the huge fountain from (84:33 - 84:37)
that fountain that was married with (84:35 - 84:38)
children (84:37 - 84:41)
married with children found yeah exactly (84:38 - 84:43)
so was the confusion though because when (84:41 - 84:54)
we got all the 90 show oh wow yeah (84:43 - 84:58)
so only 90 kids will remember that yeah (84:54 - 85:01)
so when we got back there I was like oh (84:58 - 85:04)
this isn't because we got a lift we we (85:01 - 85:06)
just walked all the way to this (85:04 - 85:07)
restaurant and that fire was like I'm (85:06 - 85:09)
really gonna walk we got to get over (85:07 - 85:09)
there (85:09 - 85:12)
so we took a lift that showed up the (85:09 - 85:15)
second we hit it and went back to it and (85:12 - 85:17)
I was like oh it's not at the event it's (85:15 - 85:20)
outside of the event and then I looked (85:17 - 85:22)
around in the game and I was like oh (85:20 - 85:24)
they're everywhere (85:22 - 85:26)
yeah so does what happened for me make (85:24 - 85:28)
you feel a little salty about that lift (85:26 - 85:31)
what had you not realized what happened (85:28 - 85:34)
oh what happened so Steve and I were (85:31 - 85:37)
walking from the exit right yeah and we (85:34 - 85:40)
passed the fountain lugia and I was like (85:37 - 85:42)
I was like we should do this but we (85:40 - 85:44)
should also get to the event because (85:42 - 85:46)
that's important no you said my phone is (85:44 - 85:48)
at 5% there's no way I can do this (85:46 - 85:49)
yes sure I'm just going to the (85:48 - 85:53)
restaurant but also at that point I was (85:49 - 85:55)
like we're getting lujah in a (85:53 - 85:57)
distribution so it doesn't matter that (85:55 - 86:00)
much so we kept walking down Michigan (85:57 - 86:03)
Avenue and then we noticed there was (86:00 - 86:07)
another lugia raid as we were going and (86:03 - 86:11)
I had 13% on my phone and Steve was (86:07 - 86:14)
still like I only have 5% he left I (86:11 - 86:16)
stayed I told you this day yeah I've (86:14 - 86:19)
never done a raid before so I stayed and (86:16 - 86:20)
I did it and it literally took like (86:19 - 86:23)
three minutes yeah it was very quick and (86:20 - 86:25)
got that done and so I was like oh I got (86:23 - 86:27)
lugia first out of everybody get rekt (86:25 - 86:31)
whatever you all I kept walking towards (86:27 - 86:34)
the restaurant a lugia raid popped (86:31 - 86:37)
directly across the street from the rest (86:34 - 86:41)
yeah and I got my second lugia like just (86:37 - 86:44)
sitting outside yeah I walked in and I (86:41 - 86:46)
walked that's when I had battery then (86:44 - 86:48)
and I was like okay I don't feel bad cuz (86:46 - 86:50)
I'd all these people came out to the (86:48 - 86:52)
meet out meet up yeah but I was like I (86:50 - 86:54)
told them all there's a lugia red right (86:52 - 86:56)
across the street we all just ordered (86:54 - 86:59)
food so yeah I didn't even cross the (86:56 - 87:00)
street we're still waiting for the food (86:59 - 87:02)
so we crossed the street did the loogie (87:00 - 87:04)
read it took like five minutes yeah we (87:02 - 87:05)
walked back and it was fine (87:04 - 87:07)
seemed like and there's no clarification (87:05 - 87:09)
on this as of we're recording (87:07 - 87:13)
if you scanned a QR code it was pretty (87:09 - 87:15)
much an instant catch oh it was an (87:13 - 87:17)
instant cash ball one ball that's it and (87:15 - 87:20)
it seemed people that didn't scan the QR (87:17 - 87:22)
code it was dark red for them yeah (87:20 - 87:24)
because I was we were there were people (87:22 - 87:26)
in slack from like Seattle and from like (87:24 - 87:28)
Pennsylvania and they were saying that (87:26 - 87:30)
it was almost impossible to catch and no (87:28 - 87:32)
one in their groups were catching them (87:30 - 87:34)
so it could have also wait that we ran (87:32 - 87:36)
in Chicago or Pennsylvania and Seattle (87:34 - 87:37)
Oh (87:36 - 87:40)
Neri sponsor every bubble so it could (87:37 - 87:42)
have been that it was the two-mile (87:40 - 87:45)
radius was just I don't think I don't (87:42 - 87:47)
think so because there were people at (87:45 - 87:49)
those at those raids that could yeah (87:47 - 87:51)
you're right as well no the one that we (87:49 - 87:53)
went to at Buckingham Fountain they said (87:51 - 87:55)
there was a guy there that said he (87:53 - 87:57)
couldn't catch it so right which doesn't (87:55 - 87:59)
make sense yeah unless it only makes (87:57 - 88:01)
sense if he didn't scan a QR code yeah (87:59 - 88:03)
which also then doesn't like that also (88:01 - 88:06)
kind of doesn't feel good to be like (88:03 - 88:08)
we're giving you a legendary Pokemon (88:06 - 88:11)
we're giving you lugia by the way five (88:08 - 88:13)
minutes after the event ends and I'm not (88:11 - 88:14)
I'm not saying that they shouldn't have (88:13 - 88:16)
done it because props to them for (88:14 - 88:17)
rolling it out as fast they did and it (88:16 - 88:18)
actually worked (88:17 - 88:20)
yeah to go we're giving you this really (88:18 - 88:23)
rare legendary Pokemon here are five (88:20 - 88:24)
that you can now see and that you can (88:23 - 88:26)
instantly catch there's like somehow (88:24 - 88:29)
tissue something weird about that too (88:26 - 88:31)
like okay now if I go into a future raid (88:29 - 88:34)
I'm going to have five lluvias to it i (88:31 - 88:38)
when I did the first one right there (88:34 - 88:40)
were probably a hundred people around (88:38 - 88:44)
and this dude had his camera on a selfie (88:40 - 88:46)
stick and he was like I'm doing a video (88:44 - 88:49)
it's the first lugia raid they did (88:46 - 88:49)
account (88:49 - 88:51)
they were so pumped but out of all the (88:49 - 88:54)
YouTube videos and all the people saying (88:51 - 88:58)
first lugia raid who was the real how (88:54 - 89:00)
many arrows are in that thumbnail but it (88:58 - 89:02)
doesn't matter it just it gave people (89:00 - 89:04)
the experience of the legendary raid (89:02 - 89:06)
that they didn't get in the park that's (89:04 - 89:07)
right exactly (89:06 - 89:09)
well and that's the same thing that you (89:07 - 89:11)
said and I said it went when we got to (89:09 - 89:13)
the restaurant as soon as those raids (89:11 - 89:16)
popped everybody that was upset about (89:13 - 89:19)
the fest suddenly was no longer upset (89:16 - 89:22)
yeah I do want to say is like a PSA (89:19 - 89:26)
though for that Articuno raid it was a (89:22 - 89:27)
mess (89:26 - 89:29)
like it was in it was down a street in (89:27 - 89:33)
the middle of downtown Chicago and there (89:29 - 89:35)
was traffic and people there were so (89:33 - 89:40)
many people there that had zero like (89:35 - 89:43)
mindfulness of the recipe they were (89:40 - 89:44)
standing in the street they were (89:43 - 89:46)
blocking traffic they didn't care about (89:44 - 89:48)
anything there was a truck that was (89:46 - 89:50)
trying to make a delivery they blocked (89:48 - 89:51)
the alley so he couldn't get (89:50 - 89:53)
out he was screaming at people to move (89:51 - 89:57)
everybody ignored him nobody moved no (89:53 - 89:59)
everybody was like laughing about how it (89:57 - 90:01)
was that they were blocking everything (89:59 - 90:03)
where was this spot that was blocking (90:01 - 90:05)
like how is it overflowing into traffic (90:03 - 90:09)
what was it was a side street not not (90:05 - 90:11)
where it was a side street it was at a (90:09 - 90:15)
gym that was I guess a theater right (90:11 - 90:17)
down the street from Buckingham Fountain (90:15 - 90:20)
and it was a not a like a huge Street (90:17 - 90:22)
like Michigan Avenue was it was a side (90:20 - 90:25)
street and so it was super easy for (90:22 - 90:26)
everybody to spill into the street and (90:25 - 90:29)
it was more that the attitude was look (90:26 - 90:31)
at how cool this is that we're blocking (90:29 - 90:32)
everything because there's so many of us (90:31 - 90:36)
unless look at how much of a disruption (90:32 - 90:39)
to the city were being and that doesn't (90:36 - 90:43)
bode well for like future events when (90:39 - 90:45)
the city is like you got it devolved (90:43 - 90:48)
into chaos why would we want this to (90:45 - 90:50)
happen again you don't want to be in (90:48 - 90:51)
Milwaukee County Park (90:50 - 90:54)
yeah exact start removing stops and (90:51 - 90:56)
stuff don't hit don't give the City (90:54 - 90:59)
Council a reason to get mad about the (90:56 - 91:01)
game Irene can you tell us about the (90:59 - 91:03)
meetup I mean you were you were really (91:01 - 91:05)
the one that planned the Meetup I mean I (91:03 - 91:07)
I found a bunch of places I sent them (91:05 - 91:10)
over to I was like all fun fact if (91:07 - 91:12)
there's any meetup or anything that (91:10 - 91:14)
involves a single phone call (91:12 - 91:18)
Irene's usually in charge that is true (91:14 - 91:20)
but you you were there you held on the (91:18 - 91:22)
floor of the meetup you greeted everyone (91:20 - 91:24)
you got everyone situated a lot of (91:22 - 91:26)
people actually didn't show up which is (91:24 - 91:27)
a bit of a bummer but I totally (91:26 - 91:29)
understood because there are a lot of (91:27 - 91:31)
people that left at like 4 o'clock yeah (91:29 - 91:33)
and so they went home for the day so to (91:31 - 91:35)
come back downtown Chicago for a guy I (91:33 - 91:37)
get it I understand but there were some (91:35 - 91:39)
awesome people that came out everyone (91:37 - 91:41)
was so nice but tell us about the meetup (91:39 - 91:43)
I don't know it was really good to see a (91:41 - 91:47)
bunch of people I got to meet people (91:43 - 91:49)
like Pete who I've never actually met in (91:47 - 91:51)
real life but I mean the Internet (91:49 - 91:55)
everyone there was super cool I remember (91:51 - 91:57)
Shannon was there for a little bit I (91:55 - 92:01)
think Adam I'm really bad with names (91:57 - 92:04)
yeah there are two Jeff's yeah (92:01 - 92:08)
Todd was there because we saw I kept (92:04 - 92:11)
seeing Todd in line no we were (92:08 - 92:15)
zigzagging our way we plan to yeah I see (92:11 - 92:17)
shirt yeah yep so what kind of (92:15 - 92:19)
restaurant was it it was called burger (92:17 - 92:23)
bar it was a burger bar yeah really good (92:19 - 92:27)
food so I highly recommend it it's super (92:23 - 92:30)
effective sponsored by burger why were (92:27 - 92:33)
they so willing to set aside half the (92:30 - 92:36)
restaurant for us with no down payment (92:33 - 92:42)
I guess work your magic or is it because (92:36 - 92:48)
they're AC wasn't working they said they (92:42 - 92:50)
said something about that like right (92:48 - 92:52)
they apologized and she was like I'm (92:50 - 92:57)
really sorry like this just happened I (92:52 - 92:57)
didn't really notice until like I was so (92:59 - 93:04)
hot at that I didn't notice as I started (93:02 - 93:06)
eating all right so I don't understand (93:04 - 93:08)
because I'm the only person literally (93:06 - 93:11)
who ate my entire hamburger and all of (93:08 - 93:16)
my troubles okay okay I did not like I (93:11 - 93:19)
no reason only half of his burger and (93:16 - 93:20)
none of your right but you never he (93:19 - 93:22)
always does yeah that that's about (93:20 - 93:24)
that's not usual to man stood what was (93:22 - 93:28)
your issue let's wrap up here I talked (93:24 - 93:29)
to a bunch of people have the meetup I (93:28 - 93:31)
talked to a bunch of people outside the (93:29 - 93:32)
meetup even random people and I just (93:31 - 93:34)
asked even during the lugia raid I was (93:32 - 93:36)
like did you guys feel the event was (93:34 - 93:39)
worth it and no everyone said yes while (93:36 - 93:42)
it might have seemed on Twitter being (93:39 - 93:45)
being terrible being a disaster being (93:42 - 93:48)
like fire fest being like the fest where (93:45 - 93:52)
the kids peed in the ball pit yep I (93:48 - 93:54)
don't know if s that was I just heard (93:52 - 93:55)
about the issue (93:54 - 93:59)
ganache con yes I do feel like Twitter (93:55 - 94:02)
kind of blew up in like it's not as bad (93:59 - 94:04)
as everyone's making it out to be (94:02 - 94:07)
because again I'm not saying that people (94:04 - 94:09)
didn't walk away angry I saw plenty of (94:07 - 94:11)
people walking away angry or (94:09 - 94:15)
disappointed or frustrated but a lot of (94:11 - 94:17)
people I talked to they were just like (94:15 - 94:18)
yeah this is worth it too (94:17 - 94:20)
despite the issues like getting unknown (94:18 - 94:22)
getting hair crossed the big thing I (94:20 - 94:23)
heard over and over again was just (94:22 - 94:26)
meeting all these people doing the (94:23 - 94:28)
loogie oh and doing the raids at 7:00 (94:26 - 94:31)
which was an hour after scheduled but (94:28 - 94:33)
still seemed to work pretty well like (94:31 - 94:36)
that all seemed really great for people (94:33 - 94:40)
that goes right into what how I felt (94:36 - 94:42)
about it though by two o'clock or (94:40 - 94:44)
whatever it was when we went to lunch I (94:42 - 94:48)
was furious I was in pot-bellied and if (94:44 - 94:50)
we're asking me if I was all right and I (94:48 - 94:52)
was like shouting about how mad I was (94:50 - 94:54)
about how much of a disaster this was (94:52 - 94:57)
how frustrated I was for Becky who I (94:54 - 94:59)
dragged here and I mean she came because (94:57 - 95:01)
she wanted to come but I'm so glad I (94:59 - 95:02)
missed that (95:01 - 95:04)
I was super mad and there was a guy (95:02 - 95:07)
behind us at the table who I overheard (95:04 - 95:09)
say that guy's blown up about the (95:07 - 95:11)
Pokemon thing and I was I was mad and I (95:09 - 95:13)
left and I like went and walked to (95:11 - 95:15)
Walgreens like took a break and walked (95:13 - 95:17)
it off a little bit and then at that (95:15 - 95:18)
point I talked to Becky and I was like (95:17 - 95:20)
look we paid a lot of money for this (95:18 - 95:23)
weekend we're here a lot of rice (95:20 - 95:25)
compared to people traveling you're (95:23 - 95:28)
right like you know we drove we paid (95:25 - 95:30)
thirty we paid thirty two bucks for a (95:28 - 95:33)
parking spot we paid yes we paid forty (95:30 - 95:35)
bucks to load up harder those thing 80 (95:33 - 95:37)
cent Poncho's gotta get those 80 cent (95:35 - 95:40)
Poncho's gotta get no and I mean it (95:37 - 95:43)
would yes comparatively we didn't pay em (95:40 - 95:46)
mmm we paid nothing compared to $250 cuz (95:43 - 95:49)
you took the day off work and I blew up (95:46 - 95:50)
at potbelly because they don't have (95:49 - 95:56)
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches my (95:50 - 95:58)
experience then was after after I got (95:56 - 96:00)
upset I went outside and I walked it off (95:58 - 96:02)
and I talked to Becky and I said look we (96:00 - 96:04)
we paid a lot to be here and at this (96:02 - 96:05)
point we just need to make the best of (96:04 - 96:08)
it we need to make the best of what we (96:05 - 96:11)
have left let's try to like have fun and (96:08 - 96:13)
try to catch stuff if we can't we can't (96:11 - 96:14)
let's go look at the rest of the park (96:13 - 96:17)
because up until this point we the only (96:14 - 96:20)
area of the park that I saw was outside (96:17 - 96:22)
of the media tent where I got serviced (96:20 - 96:24)
and back in the corner where the (96:22 - 96:25)
porta-potties were when wil and I walked (96:24 - 96:27)
over there just to try and get AT&T (96:25 - 96:30)
Wi-Fi and it still didn't work I walked (96:27 - 96:32)
around I saw the park that's (96:30 - 96:34)
we found out that mystic had the the (96:32 - 96:35)
mystic tent was the only place that had (96:34 - 96:38)
service which her we caught Lapras is (96:35 - 96:40)
and Becky was you know excited to (96:38 - 96:43)
actually be able to catch stuff at one (96:40 - 96:45)
point we tried to do a Tyranitar raid (96:43 - 96:46)
and it failed because it booted a (96:45 - 96:48)
million people out yeah and then from (96:46 - 96:51)
that point on when we left we found a (96:48 - 96:53)
porygon and we found an unknown and we (96:51 - 96:55)
found all this stuff we found hair (96:53 - 96:57)
crosses and we started catching stuff (96:55 - 96:59)
and then the the raids popped and that (96:57 - 97:02)
was exciting we got to the meetup and we (96:59 - 97:03)
were chatting with all these cool people (97:02 - 97:06)
and having a good time and then you know (97:03 - 97:08)
even when we went to the venusaur raid (97:06 - 97:09)
and it glitched out and I couldn't do (97:08 - 97:11)
that I was still in a really good mood (97:09 - 97:14)
again and after that then we started (97:11 - 97:16)
walking around for the rest of the night (97:14 - 97:19)
until like 11:30 or whatever it was yeah (97:16 - 97:20)
we probably walked around for about two (97:19 - 97:21)
hours (97:20 - 97:24)
trying to catch unknown and just just (97:21 - 97:26)
playing the game and that it liked (97:24 - 97:30)
hanging out with everybody and catching (97:26 - 97:32)
things and having fun that's what I (97:30 - 97:35)
expected the day to be and while I was (97:32 - 97:37)
upset that the actual fest was such a (97:35 - 97:40)
disaster the rest of the day and what we (97:37 - 97:43)
made of it was what made it worth it to (97:40 - 97:45)
me being able to see everybody and (97:43 - 97:47)
experiencing the stuff after the fact my (97:45 - 97:49)
frustration is just that it's a shame (97:47 - 97:51)
that that didn't happen earlier in the (97:49 - 97:54)
day yeah that that wasn't the festival (97:51 - 97:55)
that we had to be outside of the (97:54 - 97:57)
festival to have that kind of fun and (97:55 - 98:00)
that it wasn't taking place inside of (97:57 - 98:03)
the actual park but by the end of it I (98:00 - 98:05)
was happy I was it was a good day and (98:03 - 98:08)
for the most part so it was worth it to (98:05 - 98:11)
you it was worth it (98:08 - 98:13)
after the fact eventually it was worth (98:11 - 98:17)
it it's hard to say for sure for me at (98:13 - 98:19)
least because it's it's one thing (98:17 - 98:22)
without the other it without the fest we (98:19 - 98:24)
wouldn't have been able to do all of the (98:22 - 98:27)
the stuff that we did after the fact but (98:24 - 98:29)
we didn't do any of the thing that we (98:27 - 98:32)
did after the fact at the fest so it's (98:29 - 98:35)
like it kind of it kind of equaled out I (98:32 - 98:37)
guess but I still had a good time by the (98:35 - 98:40)
end of it give me your overall thoughts (98:37 - 98:43)
on the event um I'm so really not sure I (98:40 - 98:46)
was thinking about that earlier like I (98:43 - 98:47)
didn't have a sunburn (98:46 - 98:52)
absolutely just all read it's terrible I (98:47 - 98:55)
got so dark in the Sun yeah like I was (98:52 - 98:57)
really irritated I don't think I ever (98:55 - 99:01)
got mad during the day it was just kind (98:57 - 99:04)
of like this is a bummer uh and I felt (99:01 - 99:05)
really bad for a lot of people that (99:04 - 99:09)
weren't able to get the experience that (99:05 - 99:11)
they wanted I like as mica was saying I (99:09 - 99:14)
think that the post fest events redeemed (99:11 - 99:17)
the rest of the day even it kind of just (99:14 - 99:19)
resolved a lot of the like (99:17 - 99:21)
disappointment that I had I think I was (99:19 - 99:23)
disappointed in the fest rather than (99:21 - 99:26)
yeah anything else that's I mean that's (99:23 - 99:29)
a good way to say it like I'm not mad at (99:26 - 99:33)
Niantic I wasn't chanting you were mad (99:29 - 99:34)
but I was mad because of how (99:33 - 99:38)
disappointed I was in how shot the day (99:34 - 99:40)
was it wasn't that I was upset with (99:38 - 99:41)
Niantic because I don't know enough (99:40 - 99:43)
about it to know whose responsibility it (99:41 - 99:45)
was I do I don't think we said this but (99:43 - 99:48)
I want to be clear that the main issue (99:45 - 99:51)
was actually just connecting to your (99:48 - 99:54)
service provider there was very few (99:51 - 99:56)
instances where the game actually didn't (99:54 - 99:59)
work right unless it was crashing yeah (99:56 - 100:01)
but that could have been a dated (99:59 - 100:03)
exchange right so if you couldn't (100:01 - 100:05)
exchange the day to the games like I'm (100:03 - 100:08)
gonna give up yep it was mostly the (100:05 - 100:11)
actual cell service because when I was (100:08 - 100:13)
on Wi-Fi it worked flawlessly the entire (100:11 - 100:15)
time there was maybe only 10 minutes on (100:13 - 100:18)
Wi-Fi where it just went load and I bet (100:15 - 100:19)
that's when they were forcing or (100:18 - 100:22)
switching servers or pushing pushing the (100:19 - 100:24)
updates they were trying to do to fix (100:22 - 100:25)
the game (100:24 - 100:27)
the the clear issue seemed to be (100:25 - 100:31)
Internet service providers I don't know (100:27 - 100:34)
when I was able to connect with my LTE I (100:31 - 100:37)
am on Sprint like I was fine but then my (100:34 - 100:39)
game you know they were a cycler of the (100:37 - 100:43)
show I couldn't like my game was just (100:39 - 100:45)
bugging sometimes I would be connected (100:43 - 100:47)
to Wi-Fi in my game went load and (100:45 - 100:50)
sometimes it would be loaded but then I (100:47 - 100:51)
couldn't click on anything or I could (100:50 - 100:52)
click on something but then I would just (100:51 - 100:55)
sit there and freeze I mean it could (100:52 - 100:58)
have been 5050 the service provider the (100:55 - 101:00)
cell service providers and the (100:58 - 101:03)
authentication servers might have been (101:00 - 101:05)
at the same time yeah having issues (101:03 - 101:07)
contributing and then and that becomes (101:05 - 101:09)
exponential Irene I drag you everywhere (101:07 - 101:12)
if they do another Pokemon go fast and (101:09 - 101:19)
you know Nevada whatever Las Vegas watch (101:12 - 101:23)
them do Nevada yeah yeah would you go (101:19 - 101:26)
yeah I would definitely go alright go (101:23 - 101:29)
because I I think that it can't be as (101:26 - 101:31)
bad this is what happened yesterday I (101:29 - 101:34)
agree like I think we're on an upswing (101:31 - 101:36)
so we said that yesterday too and we're (101:34 - 101:38)
like well if they do another one who (101:36 - 101:40)
would go and I was like well this is (101:38 - 101:42)
their first one they're obviously gonna (101:40 - 101:44)
learn from this yeah well I think people (101:42 - 101:46)
are understanding enough it kind of some (101:44 - 101:49)
yeah so and if you're not like ok well (101:46 - 101:52)
well he said give me your hot take for (101:49 - 101:55)
the day uh I mean it was interesting for (101:52 - 101:58)
me especially because this is like such (101:55 - 102:01)
an abnormal travel thing for me was like (101:58 - 102:03)
it was so last-minute that I would like (102:01 - 102:07)
left I arrived in Chicago on the same (102:03 - 102:10)
day my expectations weren't too high (102:07 - 102:12)
because I'm not a hyper Pokemon go (102:10 - 102:14)
player is super casual about it I don't (102:12 - 102:16)
really am not so worried about (102:14 - 102:19)
completing my pokedex or anything like (102:16 - 102:24)
that so I recognize the disappointment (102:19 - 102:28)
in I had expectations of seeing not (102:24 - 102:31)
necessarily like special Pokemon but (102:28 - 102:33)
like that having the challenges be fun (102:31 - 102:37)
and interesting things to do you get new (102:33 - 102:40)
kind of games to play with the people (102:37 - 102:41)
that were there that would make it (102:40 - 102:43)
special and like none of that happened (102:41 - 102:46)
would I do it again it depends on the (102:43 - 102:49)
cost and the effort that it tricks right (102:46 - 102:52)
can you you've been to like Nationals (102:49 - 102:54)
and and regionals and stuff like that (102:52 - 102:57)
can you compare the two for people uh (102:54 - 103:00)
actually was talking to somebody about (102:57 - 103:03)
that and I think the big difference is (103:00 - 103:07)
at like US internationals now it's (103:03 - 103:11)
really people who are dedicated to TCG (103:07 - 103:15)
and VGC and have put a lot of time into (103:11 - 103:18)
that and it's not as diverse of a crowd (103:15 - 103:20)
I mean you're not getting a lot of older (103:18 - 103:25)
people in the TCG and BGC area we're in (103:20 - 103:28)
Pokemon go you've got that full range of (103:25 - 103:32)
Ages I mean kids - like your mom who's (103:28 - 103:34)
older than me who are really invested in (103:32 - 103:38)
it and I think that's more of a focal (103:34 - 103:40)
point for them that they've just like (103:38 - 103:45)
they are pokemons go is everything so I (103:40 - 103:47)
think that's what kind of created more (103:45 - 103:49)
of the tension for the event but also (103:47 - 103:52)
this was probably about five times (103:49 - 103:56)
larger than any national championship (103:52 - 103:58)
right national championship is about (103:56 - 104:01)
4,000 5,000 people you have to earn your (103:58 - 104:04)
way it's also really nothing to do at (104:01 - 104:06)
those events as weird as that as you say (104:04 - 104:08)
you hang out in downtown Indianapolis (104:06 - 104:12)
yeah you do but like like they don't (104:08 - 104:14)
even usually bring official Pokemon (104:12 - 104:16)
Center stuff there it's look when I talk (104:14 - 104:20)
to kid who kid Stark who went to us in (104:16 - 104:22)
or whatever they're calling it Nash (104:20 - 104:25)
major internationals I was like did they (104:22 - 104:26)
bring Pokemon Center at this time (104:25 - 104:27)
because they do bring Pokemon Center to (104:26 - 104:29)
Worlds yes and he was like no it's all (104:27 - 104:31)
third party vendors selling stuff from (104:29 - 104:34)
China and I was like why are they (104:31 - 104:38)
missing that opportunity and like I (104:34 - 104:40)
don't want to buy that stuff and then (104:38 - 104:41)
when you're there you're either (104:40 - 104:43)
competing all day and it's exhausting (104:41 - 104:45)
yeah you're lucky if you're gonna get a (104:43 - 104:47)
lunch and you're usually behind schedule (104:45 - 104:51)
and there are side events which are fine (104:47 - 104:53)
but some of those cost money to enter (104:51 - 104:56)
yes and besides that there's nothing to (104:53 - 105:00)
do so at least even it even everything (104:56 - 105:02)
was broken I still felt like there was (105:00 - 105:04)
like I could still connect to Wi-Fi I (105:02 - 105:06)
could still catch pokemon here or I or I (105:04 - 105:09)
could walk just two blocks outside the (105:06 - 105:11)
event and I could still actually play (105:09 - 105:14)
pokemon go normal yeah yeah and I think (105:11 - 105:16)
actually what I didn't get across (105:14 - 105:19)
clearly was at US Nationals or at a (105:16 - 105:22)
regional the people who go to those are (105:19 - 105:27)
Pokemon fans they just there's a lot of (105:22 - 105:31)
TCG players that don't know yeah I just (105:27 - 105:33)
because when I think of like Pokemon go (105:31 - 105:35)
there's a lot of the TCG players are (105:33 - 105:38)
like X poker players or like Magic the (105:35 - 105:40)
Gathering players and so they're like I (105:38 - 105:42)
don't I didn't know this Pokemon maybe (105:40 - 105:44)
that's a different conversation but I (105:42 - 105:46)
just think like there's a lot of people (105:44 - 105:49)
who are Pokemon go players who don't (105:46 - 105:51)
care as much about the Pokemon I would (105:49 - 105:55)
agree more about the Pokemon go game yes (105:51 - 105:58)
and that changes the nature of the crowd (105:55 - 106:00)
I would almost say that's evidenced by (105:58 - 106:02)
just playing Pokemon going Milwaukee how (106:00 - 106:04)
many moms that don't know anything about (106:02 - 106:06)
Pokemon or just hanging out at yeah it (106:04 - 106:09)
reads and that's a that's a longer (106:06 - 106:11)
conversation I think we could have and I (106:09 - 106:14)
think we all knew that that Pokemon glow (106:11 - 106:16)
players are a different type of Pokemon (106:14 - 106:20)
player and that's it good or bad I think (106:16 - 106:21)
it's good overall cuz now they're (106:20 - 106:23)
getting introduced in the franchise and (106:21 - 106:24)
hopefully that leads them down a road to (106:23 - 106:26)
you know enjoy the anime or to maybe (106:24 - 106:29)
pick up the card game or Pokemon is this (106:26 - 106:31)
franchise it's just not one single thing (106:29 - 106:33)
yes and I think that's what our show (106:31 - 106:35)
does really well is that we're (106:33 - 106:37)
acknowledging all aspects of the (106:35 - 106:40)
franchise and there are Pokemon specific (106:37 - 106:42)
shows that tackle specific topics and (106:40 - 106:44)
that's fine and that's great but we're (106:42 - 106:46)
all here because we love Pokemon as the (106:44 - 106:49)
franchise and just not because of (106:46 - 106:51)
Pokemon go not because of the main (106:49 - 106:54)
series game not because of the anime you (106:51 - 106:55)
asked that question didn't you at one (106:54 - 107:00)
point yeah so well enter with this I got (106:55 - 107:02)
to talk to the CEO of Niantic I waited (107:00 - 107:04)
in line it probably took maybe 45 (107:02 - 107:05)
minutes to get up there (107:04 - 107:07)
but I asked them two questions I got a (107:05 - 107:08)
picture with them I'm probably not gonna (107:07 - 107:10)
post the picture cuz it's kind of bad (107:08 - 107:11)
makes me look bad (107:10 - 107:13)
got like a weird neck thing going on I (107:11 - 107:15)
wasn't happy with the picture afterwards (107:13 - 107:19)
auto shop dude but I asked if this was (107:15 - 107:22)
the last Pokemon go-fast event and it's (107:19 - 107:24)
kind of a dumb question because of (107:22 - 107:26)
course it's not but I wanted to hear it (107:24 - 107:29)
from CEO if he was willing to answer it (107:26 - 107:31)
and he was he didn't hesitate he was (107:29 - 107:34)
like today was really disappointing but (107:31 - 107:36)
we're not gonna let us stop that from (107:34 - 107:38)
improving and doing this again in the (107:36 - 107:41)
future and he said you know we still (107:38 - 107:43)
have our Safari event planned in Europe (107:41 - 107:45)
we still have the event planned in Japan (107:43 - 107:49)
the Pikachu virus Pikachu absolutely out (107:45 - 107:52)
prey because you Byron I actually talked (107:49 - 107:54)
to some people who are like planning to (107:52 - 107:56)
go to Europe for the Safari zones and (107:54 - 107:58)
planning to go to the Yokohama (107:56 - 108:01)
yes--you outbreak so he's like we still (107:58 - 108:03)
have those planned earlier onstage he (108:01 - 108:05)
did say that they did plan on doing this (108:03 - 108:07)
again next year they didn't say dates or (108:05 - 108:09)
place or whatever they just said that (108:07 - 108:10)
they wanted to do it next year which (108:09 - 108:13)
leads me to believe that after the Japan (108:10 - 108:14)
event that'll probably be the rest for (108:13 - 108:17)
big events the second question I asked (108:14 - 108:21)
was how will he felt that Pokemon Go has (108:17 - 108:25)
captured a big bigger audience than the (108:21 - 108:28)
main series games could ever do and I (108:25 - 108:29)
think this important question for a lot (108:28 - 108:32)
I wasn't expecting uh you know an (108:29 - 108:34)
in-depth answer or anything but I think (108:32 - 108:36)
it's an important question for all (108:34 - 108:39)
Pokemon for the entire Pokemon fan base (108:36 - 108:43)
to think about because you have 20 years (108:39 - 108:45)
of Pokemon you have seven generations of (108:43 - 108:48)
games and of course their main goal I (108:45 - 108:49)
would assume they're met one of their (108:48 - 108:51)
main goals is to get more and more (108:49 - 108:53)
people to play pokemon with each (108:51 - 108:57)
generation generation one is easily the (108:53 - 109:00)
most popular because it was such a such (108:57 - 109:03)
a viral outbreak at that time it was a (109:00 - 109:05)
peak to outbreak at that time such a (109:03 - 109:08)
virus generation 2 very popular I think (109:05 - 109:10)
generation 3 and 4 were kind of the low (109:08 - 109:15)
points and then with 5 and then I think (109:10 - 109:17)
6 did better than 5 and I'm pretty sure (109:15 - 109:19)
7 is still on track (109:17 - 109:21)
better than six there's they still (109:19 - 109:25)
didn't capture what pokemon go has (109:21 - 109:27)
captured with you know getting my mom to (109:25 - 109:30)
play and getting you know your wife to (109:27 - 109:32)
play Micah and so what his answer was (109:30 - 109:35)
was he pointed at my phone and he said (109:32 - 109:36)
the reason we were able to accomplish (109:35 - 109:40)
that is because of this everyone has a (109:36 - 109:42)
mobile phone everyone can download this (109:40 - 109:44)
game for free anyone can play and (109:42 - 109:48)
because of that is why we're in more (109:44 - 109:49)
players hands than something like the (109:48 - 109:53)
main series game yeah hey whether you (109:49 - 109:54)
like it or not I think that's very (109:53 - 109:55)
important (109:54 - 109:58)
yeah so that is that that was the event (109:55 - 110:00)
if they do another event this year cool (109:58 - 110:02)
I would be I would love to try to go to (110:00 - 110:03)
it you know what I would love to go to (110:02 - 110:05)
the Europe stuff and the Japan stuff but (110:03 - 110:07)
that those are expensive tickets that is (110:05 - 110:09)
very funny (110:07 - 110:11)
like we said time and time again totally (110:09 - 110:12)
understand why people left that mad (110:11 - 110:14)
especially if they spent like a thousand (110:12 - 110:16)
dollars in a flight yeah for me it was (110:14 - 110:18)
spending you know thirty two dollars to (110:16 - 110:21)
park and then however my four or five (110:18 - 110:23)
dollars in gas to get down here and an (110:21 - 110:25)
hour and a half of my time (110:23 - 110:28)
maybe my my tune would be different if (110:25 - 110:30)
it was a two hundred dollar flight yeah (110:28 - 110:33)
but but even for the people that stayed (110:30 - 110:37)
I it sounded like the it sounded like (110:33 - 110:39)
the Friday night before was incredible (110:37 - 110:41)
to play pokemon go there was lose every (110:39 - 110:43)
where and people were playing all night (110:41 - 110:46)
and that would blew up social media that (110:43 - 110:49)
Chicago was just quote-unquote lit yeah (110:46 - 110:53)
so it was all for people who didn't live (110:49 - 110:54)
there it was all new stop so if you had (110:53 - 110:57)
a lucky egg it was like 500 XP s stop (110:54 - 110:59)
and they were non-stop everywhere yeah I (110:57 - 111:01)
think the I think the overall message is (110:59 - 111:04)
like while the fest itself was a (111:01 - 111:07)
disaster and bummer and nee antic was (111:04 - 111:10)
extremely apologetic for that and they (111:07 - 111:11)
were extremely upset with themselves for (111:10 - 111:13)
that and that's you know those were (111:11 - 111:16)
words right from the producer that where (111:13 - 111:17)
I was talking to will and I at the time (111:16 - 111:21)
they were so sorry this happened but for (111:17 - 111:24)
a whole weekend of the Friday night with (111:21 - 111:26)
Chicago just blowing up with lers and (111:24 - 111:27)
new people and everyone were walking (111:26 - 111:30)
around playing and then while the (111:27 - 111:32)
Saturday most of the day was a (111:30 - 111:33)
disappointment that (111:32 - 111:35)
after that evening seemed to be a big (111:33 - 111:39)
success and then if your is still in (111:35 - 111:42)
Chicago for Sunday that that event (111:39 - 111:45)
extends throughout Monday morning so (111:42 - 111:47)
it's not planning to do and I believe (111:45 - 111:49)
you are taking advantage of that correct (111:47 - 111:51)
yeah yeah I'm gonna head back to Chicago (111:49 - 111:53)
it's only it's only an hour and a half (111:51 - 111:56)
there on an audiobook yep walk around (111:53 - 111:59)
try and find that unknown oh yeah I'm (111:56 - 112:01)
missing one unknown and I think I would (111:59 - 112:04)
have better success doing a bunch of (112:01 - 112:06)
raids while all those players are down (112:04 - 112:09)
there yeah I could probably go downtown (112:06 - 112:11)
Milwaukee and maybe get one or two or or (112:09 - 112:14)
whatnot but I think because there's (112:11 - 112:16)
still so many Pokemon players there on (112:14 - 112:19)
top of just how many people are in (112:16 - 112:21)
downtown Chicago it'll be very easy to (112:19 - 112:23)
like accomplish what I want to (112:21 - 112:25)
accomplish in a shorter amount of time (112:23 - 112:27)
yeah it'll be interesting to see if (112:25 - 112:30)
raids in Milwaukee are still for people (112:27 - 112:32)
who went and scan their QR code if (112:30 - 112:34)
they're still instant caches yeah yeah (112:32 - 112:35)
yeah I guess well that doesn't really (112:34 - 112:37)
matter too much because they're gonna go (112:35 - 112:39)
away yeah yeah sorry tomorrow (112:37 - 112:42)
well that's that that is Pokemon go fest (112:39 - 112:45)
we will be we will be back next week (112:42 - 112:48)
with a normal episode and if my audio (112:45 - 112:50)
from all the interviews I captured (112:48 - 112:52)
sounds good you guys will probably get a (112:50 - 112:55)
bonus episode this week I know I talked (112:52 - 112:57)
to reversal and trainer tips and twin (112:55 - 113:00)
tendo it was funny when I talk to that (112:57 - 113:02)
guy was like be honest man I haven't (113:00 - 113:05)
seen a single one of your YouTube videos (113:02 - 113:07)
and he just laughed he was so nice he (113:05 - 113:08)
just laughed he's like totally (113:07 - 113:10)
understand there's so much content out (113:08 - 113:12)
there yeah but I find out what I plan on (113:10 - 113:14)
checking out his stuff so got a couple (113:12 - 113:15)
interviews there so hopefully that (113:14 - 113:18)
sounds good if you don't hear about it (113:15 - 113:19)
ever again in the future it's probably (113:18 - 113:21)
because the SD card got corrupt or it (113:19 - 113:23)
just sounds awful (113:21 - 113:26)
who knows I I hope though it turns out (113:23 - 113:28)
for you guys but I think that'll be it (113:26 - 113:31)
you can follow us on Twitter a little (113:28 - 113:34)
bit of housecleaning no way l-'izzat (113:31 - 113:38)
wash in the sink Micah is at Micah the (113:34 - 113:41)
