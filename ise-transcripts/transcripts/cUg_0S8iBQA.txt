underpaid laborers well underpaid when the paycheck is zero yes the paycheck is an exposure this is a quality show uh will is here strangely enough i'm in a good mood this weekend i don't know what happened i i'm trying to search within myself to figure out why where this positivity came from but there you go i'm i'm and i'm ready to announce my new podcast i'm going to be doing where i review uh flavors of energy drinks uh here's a little sample the energy drink brand is bang the flavor is miami cola and it's awful it has so much like potential it's like a little like coconut coke right or maybe like a little pineapple coke or something no no no no this just tastes like they they took like every mixer at the bar that was left at the end of you know on south beach and they just poured it into a glass and like they're like cheers miami cola doesn't have a name swill yes yeah greg here i have a new chair very exciting now i have two back support chairs for my two offices is it uh very nice offices swanky yeah well one's my work office and then this well i mean i'm calling this an office because there's not a bed in here otherwise it would be a bedroom did you get herman miller steal casemaster look i don't have streamer money steve i have to go with the amazon something something a hundred and eighteen dollars good enough yeah it's easy enough to sit on yeah actually though i bought so i had bought this style of chair when i was working from home because the one chair that i had that was 20 years old was cutting the circulation off to my legs so i bought it thinking well this is a temporary feeling until i return to the office oh ho ho ho i'm not because that's where my 800 chair is that i cannot take from the office uh so i bought it and actually really really liked it uh so when i split the two rooms finally i'm like i'll just buy that chair again only this time i'm buying it in blue instead of black fancy and it's quite good i mean i don't you know i'm not in front of a camera for eight hours so i don't have to sit here i get to move it's true wait i have an alert can i make an alert no it's too late oh but go ahead i have uh i i am doing the 2020 i don't know how to pronounce the name of this company it's s-c-h-e-e-p-j-e-s it's like dutch or something i always say sheep jizz 20 20 crochet along i tricked several other people into also doing it with me it's a crochet along it's not a crochet by yourself so you got to get other people roped in but if any of our listeners want to participate in the crochet along i'm going to do like an instagram group for talking about it then it's just look for the 2020 sheep just uh crochet along it's it's going to be a wild and fun ride are you all making something specific you all make the same thing but the the way okay so the way in a like a knit a long or crochet along works is you get two weeks worth of instructions at a time and then everybody's supposed to complete that two-week section oh you don't get the whole pattern at the beginning so what you're saying is you're going to be doing this during the pokemon masters talk exactly so if anybody wants to enjoy me i believe i mentioned last week right we're doing the pokemon masters crochet along so we're just tying it in with the 20 20 sheep just 20 20. i keep saying 20 20 twice but the that one and uh yeah i mean i've already got uh greta in norway is joining and uh maddie on the move is also doing it with us it's gonna be fun and you know when steve and greg are talking about pokemon masters and you're not listening anymore you can start getting those uh double crochets triple crochets etc etc the masters news is not very long this week well good because the crochet along doesn't start until september 23rd [Laughter] we do have pokemon news a little bit of go a little bit masters uh anime stuff and some competitive stuff let's jump into i guess let's just get the master stuff out of the way pretty short uh the anniversary event still going until the end of the month september 30th so you can still get your chance of getting blue or red or leaf sigma suit versions uh of those characters are still available in uh banners that's what they're called right banners yep this past week they just announced the story event family ties which i have not done yet i have i'm still working through my eggs but oh yeah i haven't done it yet either i have i have feelings about it but they've introduced uh lusamine and lily and gladion all as characters that you can actually pull on and get i think there were rumors or speculation that only lily would be available with clevery because she was in the trailer with clefairy but all characters are obtainable uh but they are they yes they're just doing um so lily is right or sorry lucy means right now and then i think on monday is lily and then like two days after lily's gladion so they're just spacing him out a little bit so of all the pokemon that i associate with lily which is two clefairy is not one of those two yeah what where did that come from she has a clefairy in her team inside the moon she has a team yeah because yeah she like gets all happy she becomes a trainer and she's like ready to battle and stuff and boy i don't remember any of that i just remember getting the bag and then on in the anime she had a in the lowland vulpix yes and the anime she had the vulpix uh i don't know if she had any more pokemon in the anime uh in i never finished it so i don't know yeah i never finished the anime in in the manga she had a cutie fly well i i would take a cutie fly yeah in cosmic eclipse she had a clefairy she had it at one point in the games like there's one clefairy she uses and i don't remember where i think it's ultra sun alternate i mean it's clear that they're using ultrasound ultra moon versions of all these characters for the storyline well yeah because it's just like star trek where they erase the whole like original sun and moon and they're like no no no don't look over there look at this new one i mean i will say spoiler alert spoiler alert they do at least touch on what a terrible mother listening is oh okay they do in the story yeah uh they it's it's definitely the ultrasound ultramoon uh bad mom light that was in those stories instead of bad mom regular which was on the moon but yeah there's a lot of the story is how bad lusamine was and they do have a guzma and lusamine uh cutscene of those two meeting again which was kind of cool because that there's all tents as they were like oh it's you how did you get here see the nice thing about masters is we can even if you don't even if you don't play masters you can at least listen to us argue about what characters should have which pokemon for the next 10 minutes in ultrasound ultra moon lily does have a clefairy it is kept in a heal ball and when you do a multi battle so when you and her battle together in the aether paradise she does send out clefairy and then when you if she is in the battle tree and she is your partner in the battle tree she will use rabombi or comfey as her two pokemon so that was her only pokemon besides cosmog that she has in the games so accurate i guess is is what that is i thought will you were going to complain about lusa means sink pair which i don't understand these complaints either is it not the jellyfish ultra beast it is not no it's the cockroach shelter beast yeah that's the one that she's based on exactly that looks like her right so lusamine has ferramosa and people were upset that she doesn't have nile ego but like like the eight months prior to sun and moon coming out everyone was like oh lucimine and pheramosa right it's the one that looks like her yeah i mean to be fair i mean it's not uh it's not illegal that like takes her takes over her body so i can kind of see yeah that but like isn't the fan theory though the reason niall ego looks like lily is because lusa mean dresses up lily to look like nyligo and that's like one throwaway line that lily says of like this is the first time i dressed myself my mom normally dresses me oh there's a whole cutscene about lucia mean freaking out about lily going shopping in in masters which is kind of funny i don't have a problem with loose being using feramosa no i think it's yeah i think it's fine i think as well because they gave her these that's good it's the one that looks like her yeah right like wait which which ultra beast does gladion look like i don't think people uh associated gladion with an ultra beast no he looks he's got the same spiky hair as savalai yeah well because yeah well savala is like the ultra what was it you ba i'll you be you be k ultra beast killer is that there's no killing in pokemon oh they do also touch on the fact that lucy means walking around with an ultra beast in the masters a whole slew of people are like excuse me uh we're gonna have to kill that thing they could always do uh cigna suit loosamine and give her nighly god i guess because at one point like there's zero other characters in the masters or in the pokemon universe that would get nile ego yeah i don't know where what else you would do uh i mean if you wanted to do like more ultra beasts you could have the the island like captains because they all had to fight the ultra beasts that came to their islands yeah they touched on that a little bit in the game there's a couple of guys there in depth yeah there's a bunch of scenes that really play off but the thing that i like most about the secondary storyline so the main storyline is pretty standard um and it you know it does that sort of anime of we have 10 minutes to resolve all this conflict and they take that 10 minutes and then they resolve the conflict um but the scenes after that you have to get through the events um touch on a lot of things that honestly if you're following the series you're like wouldn't so and so and so and so be kind of upset about this and then there's a scene about those people sort of approaching lusamine or the kids and being like you know this isn't great uh and then talking through that so they do they do a pretty good job of dealing with the problems of that family being together again and everybody that lusamine hurt uh has a little bit of a time to like deal with lisa means so they do they do a pretty good job at masters i think if we're looking at lusa means pokemon in the manga she has all the same as in sun and moon but she also apparently in the manga catches how do we say this neganda dell naganadal that's it naga natal like that that's it she catches a noggle nadal she catches nyligo and she catches celestila in the manga oh really how many ultra beasts are in sword and shield zero yeah exactly none until the dlc yeah i don't think all the other ultra beasts were shown in the trailer it's a surprise where the top of the showed in the trailer they're pretty sure they're coming yeah they were yeah we there was a huge argument about that because i'm on my twitch stream because because we were talking about how rilaboom was so dominant with grassy glide and i was like well if they keep it you know it probably won't be as dominant once they roll out like tapulele or tapu coco because they'll set up terrain right away and then somebody was like no that's a spoiler don't don't spoil it for me and i was like i'm pretty sure they were in the trailer and then they were like i don't remember and i was like i'm gonna pull up the official trailer and sure enough the tapus are in the trailer so but when chrysler can get more dominant because top of bulu puts down grassy terrain no because real boom puts down grassy train oh when it comes out yeah oh okay oh that's right hidden ability yeah very good i need to do some of that some of that work so taboos are for sure coming the trailer did not show ultra beasts so i don't know uh i don't know what that is october surprise we'll see it uh the last character is gladion i don't think there's much to say here i'm gladion has sevelai oh here are the dates uh so loosamine is september 9th to september 30th gladion is september 13th to september 30th and lily is september 16th through september 30th uh keep in mind if you are trying to be cautious about gem spending uh they did say there will be holiday sink pairs in october and there's been a lot of six pairs this month also i believe some people are suggesting out of the three that lily might be the best if you're only picking one but that's opinion full disclosure that i'm partnered with dna i mean i haven't seen how how are they making that decision hey cause support fairy i don't people want more supports right look your support is skyla or nothing at this point i mean the banner for it's just lucid me right now yeah september 13th for gladian's september 16th for lily it's september 13th well look i don't know when it resets september 13th at 11 pm greg i'm not gonna be awake then not with that attitude uh and they did for the family titles event give just 3 000 bonus gems so all you have to do is log in 3000 bonus gems is a 10 poll which is now an 11 poll for free you just gonna log in i pulled twice and i got lucia mean once so great i still have not pulled leaf still side but i pulled serena on leaf spanner last night so that's pretty good people like serena i think serena is very good can you trade pulls nope no did you uh greg get your rosa to six star ex yes okay the second like that's hard i mean they give it to you yeah basically yeah i just curious i just i just i just maxed her out last night i haven't used her yet though i haven't done all the leveling stuff yet but you know i will at some point i'm just trying to get all the free stuff out of the very easy family event once you've completed it and you can skip to get a bunch i'm like i want to see all the cutscenes yeah i gotta do that tonight that's what i did uh speaking of characters in the pokemon universe there is the gym leader elisa and skyla kotobukiyai figures i don't know what that word means uh that are on the pokemon center they are two of unova's most popular and memorable gym leaders do you agree with this will out of the eight they are two of them [Laughter] [Music] yes i mean they're they're certainly not the most forgettable of the gym leaders in unova so uh who's morphe berg and clay are pretty forgettable right yes yeah marlin is pretty forgettable i think if marlin should never have happened bryce bryson man bryson is amazing i will hear nothing against bryson yeah no bryson turned his back on being a gym leader no no no no he wanted to pursue what dwayne the rock johnson was you wanted anything right he did not have a true passion for being a pokemon gym leader and he should never have dabbled in those arts if he wasn't ready to commit he met the pinnacle of his gym career by picking ice he saw the path forward and said you know what i'm gonna go act your favorite pokemon isn't even an ice type pokemon right but like i'm sure he was tired of like hi everybody ruins my gym because ice has the most weaknesses i'm gonna go act yeah i just think all all of the ice type gym leaders have been pretty bottom of the barrel i think that's a nice way to put it right there are you speaking ill of candace uh mostly wolf rick what about price [Music] who there you go there's your answer on that one who's the who is it in sword shield uh melody right melody no it wasn't it wasn't in my game so yeah melanie is amazing hands down best ice gym leader posed strikingly on a pokeball base nambasa gym leader elisa and her partner pokemon imonga imoga amp up the drama of any pokemon collection this gym leader model is surrounded by lightning as befitting a trainer who works with electric type pokemon a moga rests on the sleeve of its trainer's jacket ready to spring into action when a challenger appears miss stralton i don't know how to say these yeah mr alton mr alton city the stralton city's gym leader skyla is poised for a fight or flight or battle with her partner pokemon swanna on her back skyla is a breath of fresh air a gust of wind beneath her feet and arms outstretched as i feel like i'm reading a pbs ad for like an auction right now and at the 40 level you'll get a tote bag uh ready to fight captures skyla's affinity for the air as indicated by her career as a pilot and the fact that she specializes in training flying type pokemon both figures are exclusive to pokemon center and for fans seeking premium statues to showcase their love of the pokemon world that is not me i am not seeking any premium statues ever you don't want to spend 129 on these are are they posable figurines no they're not even posable figurines no i don't know this gurky pokemon pumpkin party keychain look we're talking about katabookies here i know i've moved on to the other thing oh i think i think i think as of reading this elisa is is sold out i think she's gone i do not see her anymore skyla still there i was gonna ask which one is more popular skyla or lisa but i think we already got our answer i think we've got that answer they're both still on the website oh okay they are they are there they just weren't next to each other i was worried i mean is it a full art skyla because full art skyla is going to run you a pretty penny yeah it's full it's fuller was there ever a full art elisa was there even there had to have been an elisa supporter card i don't think there was wow i mean both the figures are really great like they're very cool looking i don't want to spend 130 to have more junk in my house yeah i just can't like the whole haunted village thing nope spoilers i said this on stream i feel like like the like if i was ever to go down the path of 100 plus figures it would have to be at like a convention it would have to be like there's one left the guy the guy is there like you know you know buddy for you i'm gonna knock 10 off the price you know these are 129 i got one left i want to move it i'll give you a discount and then you barter a little bit more you get them to knock off like 20. and then you're like well i've already been sitting here for 20 minutes looking at it and arguing with you my here's my credit card like that's the only situation i feel like i could buy a 100 figure but like you are such a sucker like because what you're saying is what you're saying is in order for me to buy this i want somebody to actively lie to me about the rarity and the price so that i feel like i'm winning in a in in this transaction so that when you leave he pops another one out and says oh this is the last one you should have seen this guy who left who was gonna buy it but didn't and then you go on ebay and see like they're selling him for four dollars each like you're just straight up saying hey everybody as long as you tell me a good story and say that you're giving me a discount i'm gonna buy it it's the thrill it's the thrill of the hunt but the hottest the hunt is the deal it's the thrill of being lied to i just i don't i what do you do with these things you there's nothing that you can do with them it's not like it's like easter comes around you're like oh let me display my elisa figurines for easter [Laughter] oh i'm gonna go on a flight i need to bring my lucky skyla i mean i can imagine if you're an internationally famous twitch streamer then there's like you you want to have some background but in me and my home where i don't even want both of you to come visit me uh you know there's nothing to look at here except some white walls that's because you don't have figurines around your house i don't want figurines yeah not with that attitude if i was making ninja money or pokeman money blind the figures up gotta put something in the background i mean you do plushes already uh yeah but plushes are like i i get maybe two plushes every three months and what is a plush like 11.99 like the last plushies they're 30 to 50 dollars i am not getting those plushies i got the sitting cutie unknown and i got the city cutie uh porygon 2. all right sitting cuties are not stuffed animals they're more like beanie babies i mean the pikachu in the halloween outfit that's currently new is 21.99 it's pretty good and the ginger outfit no no that's more pico no that's more pico the outfits confused me see they were dressed up appropriately yeah i mean at least with the at least with the haunted well i don't know the same argument could be made about the haunted village or any christmas decorations like yeah i guess you bust them out for christmas but they don't do anything either you just like set them up and they decorate your home for a lovely visit that is not happening this year exactly so like this is yeah this is my challenge greg because you'd love you're like in this way you are the opposite of me you love decorating for christmas it's like are you going to bother i'll get a tree are you going to make caramels i don't know because how do i get them to people mail i'll come to your house okay pick up a bag of them i mean i probably will because it's like the one thing i do to really get into the holidays but um i'm not mail them to you steve you have to actually come in person these are in-person gifts only i gave them to you last year you came in person the year before i brought them to you so you have no you have no reason to sit there and sigh at me i have kept you in sweet sweet sugar for two years now forty dollars a haunted village is expensive yeah well so is it though because if you go to michael's like their haunted village of of nothingness they don't have like a fee while their theme is spooky but they don't have like a brand attached to it but wait you said it's misleading to say 40 for the haunted village because it's 160 to get all four right right right forty dollars you can't just have one you can't just have miss mages i've been so horrors we're gonna talk about the spooky village uh the limex spooky village at michaels is that not wait is that brand named well yeah that's what it is spooky town is there not like competitive competitors for spooky town i don't think so i mean you said michaels i'm on michael's there is exactly one spooky town okay that i'm finding all right well and they vary in price depending on the size right well yeah because for for the michael stuff you could get like a a windmill or like a silo or just like a a wagon but there are bigger buildings so we have to compare the buildings to the building also they're made out of porcelain and not cheap plastic ah there you go they also light up and are not made out of a cheap plastic which is the problem when i bought that first train and i'm like oh it's just cheap plastic and i'm paying 40 for this nope is the train plastic i thought the train was like a porcelain it's like no it's not porcelain it's definitely that resin porcelain yeah it's not plastic plastic though is plastic resin are they the same yes they're pretty they're uh they're in the same family polly resin is what this uh haunted house on pokemon center dot com says yes now that you say they don't light up that's probably why i'm not pulling the trigger if i'm getting something spooky oh yeah it's gotta have like flash you're not flashing lights but glowing lights yeah yeah 160 dollars for the whole set i think i would gosh my limit would probably be 100 for four items but 25 would probably so how much is a building for spooky town okay so the same size well slightly bigger than what you're probably getting for these the lemax spooky town zombie jazz cafe that lights up is 35.99 the pokemon tax gets gets you again their spooky uh spooky town frightful flea feline choir which is smaller is 29.99 it is out of porcelain but there's no lights on that one the spooky town black raven manor which has uh looks like lights and sound and flying bats and ravens around the top is 71.99 yeah uh spooky town's hideous harry's toy factory oh this is an abomination no it has everything included it is 89.99 but i would not have this in my home this is this is horrible well it is supposed to be spooky i mean valid but i would not walk into the room that that thing was in oh it's the clown yep not into it i'm out it looks much it looks like the finer details are more good compared to the pokemon ones yeah this is a quality product except for the clowns these are the clown entrance and the scary bears out front oh classic michael's thing they they always like try to tell you it's on sale even though you'll never you'll never find it at 150 you just sat at a convention center if somebody did the accepting you would buy it yeah but i know what the price of the lisa is it's 129. yeah if they lit up i would be more willing to pay the 40 bucks but now that you've mentioned they don't they don't glow they don't do anything i think i'm out of poly resin which i don't even know what that is it does say limit of two which the train i don't think had a limit because the train stuff sold out really quick and i'm sure i'm sure it ended up on ebay shortly after i'm sure uh well let's take a break when we come back we got some anime news and some pokemon vgc news so we will be right back alien invasion a space [Music] uh we are back from our break yep your favorite movie greg pokemon the movie 2000 is now on pokemon tv free to watch which ones pokemon the movie 2000 it is uh with sir lawrence the third trying to get ah yeah multrace articuno and zapdos that was very good i hm i still stand by the fact that we would have gotten the announcement for crown tundra and this movie lining up and zapdos and articuna moltres coming back to pokemon go lining up i just don't think we got i just i'm thinking words back up rewind i just think because of the pandemic they are not confident with the exact release date and that's why we have not gotten the announcement exactly the state of what chronicles i thought they said november no they just said holiday yeah yeah that's november sure yeah maybe maybe it's all coincidence i mean it would probably come in replace of a holiday game right like probably like the second week in november probably because i mean it just says fall and say fall of 2021 i thought it said holiday i thought they always used the word holiday according to gamesradar.com six days ago uh sometime in fall 2020 is what they are showing well fall is to what december 21st technically technically yes okay so we know that vivid voltage is coming out the 13th of november and black friday is the 27th and so if we're assuming black friday is canceled this year if any store is foolish enough to try yeah i'm going to be picketing outside there yeah i mean they already said that like so many stores already closing like they're just not going to do that whole holiday thing they've already said that hey i'm just looking at the calendar it's all cyber just because a store is not opening for black friday doesn't mean it's still not black friday true i mean then they would do it on cyber monday sure i'm just saying we have we have three fridays before black friday we have the sixth the 13th and the 20th when did certain shield come out back my calendar up we had a party at my house greg was it that sort of chilled not memorable i remember the party i don't remember the date so richard was the 15th so we had the 1st 8th 15th 22nd 29th was black friday it's the 15th and the 16th if we remember correctly was a community day was it not it was chimchar i think no chimchar yes it was a starter pokemon we we we feel like the pokemon company has a history of putting everything on the same weekend and we always complain every time they do it i don't care it doesn't matter to me if it's the 6th the 13th the 20th the 28th 7th december 4th december 11th doesn't matter i don't care it's coming out on the 13th but that that's where i'm staking my claim i am claiming november 13th i just think it's a little weird that they're doing a bunch of articuno zapdos small trace thingies suddenly subtly and we have not gotten a trailer yet but i don't think it's that weird because of the pandemic i mean we got a trailer we just haven't gotten a crown tundra specific trailer right we saw the artwork for them like yeah well i think i think there's just one more trailer i don't think there's gonna be like two or three trailers i think there's gonna be one more trailer show crown tundra give us the date did i love armor come out on was that on a friday uh isle of armor was on a wednesday oh yeah all right now hold on we gotta go back everyone scroll your calendar back to november okay we got the fourth we got the eleventh we got the i am i am shaking my claim on the 13th and the 11th we got the 25th it's not coming out right before thanksgiving why well that would that wouldn't why would that be so bad though because it's to be swamped by thanksgiving things what thanksgiving every single adult and child goes man i wish i had something to do on thanksgiving that wasn't football i mean except for the football football oh they'll be football isn't football back sort of basketball it's back at this point yes we will see how the how it all plays out because november is a long way away yeah it is i feel like it's so close i feel like september's almost over at this point but it's it is literally the 13th day of september not even the halfway point okay speaking of anime go watch your power of us power of one movie power of one power of one not power of us do not watch power of us unless you wanna watch power of us and then please go ahead this is off pokemon.com hone your trainer skills by watching more pokemon journeys series on netflix 12 new episodes got some breaking news for you guys that was the breaking news song yeah a little urgency post-breaking news would be good uh it is pronounced squivet not squove it that's what i've been saying this whole time look not here to argue because of covet right yeah yeah yes it's squirrel covet squabbit just the correction is now the the detail we still do not know whether it's what will i think will you're on the ryan camp and i'm on the road on the ryan camp i'm on the road i mean everybody's on the ryan camp except for steve right hey i went to babynames.com and i hit the little button babymainsnames.com the authoritative source for pokemon naming babynames.com literally the only website that has that name which means somebody submitted it with no pronunciation i i don't believe in the 24 episodes we now have the dragon type gym leader has shown up and their name has been said out loud we're still on dragon watch for that it's ryan watch [Laughter] uh have either of you seen any of the pokemon journeys i saw 1-12 and it's good it's a little scattered but it's good yeah i think that's the problem when your trainers can go anywhere at any time it is very that's i that was irene's complaint too she's like where what city are we in right now yeah it's it's very scattered and it makes since they just travel it makes the world seem incredibly tiny because like i work go to gallery today and then like was that an hour flight like how are you what is distance here because like it took you 14 days to get somewhere by boat and then you're like we're gonna hop on a plane and we're there in like a half a second like it's very confusing they very much skip over how big the world is or they just have decided you know we don't we don't care about where these things are located they just hop on i think that it just it feels like it's hard to just everything is just disjointed a lot because they just end up in whatever region for whatever story and it feels real scattered does it feel like they're on a journey no um i mean they're making progress every episode yeah this is off pokemon.com as well mega evolve a bee drill and use it in battle to unlock mega houndoom celebrate the debut of mega evolution with a

battles during the event period it will receive a temporary cp boost making it eve what is this sentence remember when you use mega beedrill in battles excluding raid battles that's the only thing i want to use magnus for during them i like to battle my friends it will receive a temporary cp boost making it even more of a force finally during this time pokemon that are weak to bug type attacks and flying type attacks will appear in raids more often team rocket will also be using different shadow pokemon so be sure to evolve your bee drill before you take it into battle i have two uh leftover remote raid passes because they had like a get three remote raid passes for one coin dealing they did that twice in the last two weeks yep well i only i only did it once so when you you can start with your annoying text messages of i'm about to do some raid do you want to join cuz i i might just be in the mood so we don't know if we well we do know well there's no official announcement whether we have unlocked mega pidgeot for doing two 200 what was it like 2 100 million raids or something 2 million raids 20 million raids it doesn't matter niantic's not setting a goal we can't achieve i mean i battled a gym at brunch today twice so did my part so the reason we haven't gotten well by the time this podcast comes up we'll probably have the announcement but the reason that there wasn't an announcement the last week was because niantic gave everyone at niantic the week off for mental health oh nice um that was the week of labor day so monday would have been off anyways and then the rest four days niantic just gave the team off um so when they get they come back in the offices or i guess i don't think they're working at the office i think they're all working at home when they come back to their home office on september 14th i'm sure we'll hear about the mega pigeot and i'm sure what is this 275 million battles between team rocket trainer battles gym battles i'm sure that will be there's just not there's just not a situation where they're like well guys you only did 260 million battles no houndoom this week like we're going to get the hound and we're going to get the pidgey at and then people are going to continue not being excited about megas i guess unless they come back from their break with a new mega plan no that's not do your mega b drill stuff i don't find your ladybug finally time time to put your complaints hat on look some people never take it off so go right ahead i'm so irritated about this this is also off pokemon.com battle in the pokemon players cup 2 qualifier online competition in pokemon sword and pokemon shield complete compete against fellow sword and shield trainers to advance in the second players cup regional qualifier test your skills as a pokemon trainer well if only you could and earned the opportunity to play in the pokemon players cup 2. this event will take place september 24th through september 27th all trainers who participate will receive 50 battle points in which can be redeemed after the uh rankings have been announced players must have at least one battle to receive the battle points however pokemon players cup 2 will be open to masters division only which means you have to be at least 16 years or older competition rules will be established for rank series five and then it says you know total play time is you have 20 minutes per battle for 90 seconds for team preview 45 seconds for turn order 15 battles a day the 15 battle stacks so 45 battles for the weekend so technically you could skip friday saturday and then do 45 battles on sunday if you really wanted to there will be an announcement of who makes the finals this is the qualifier so they'll be announcement later if the top players going into the finals maybe you don't play competitive battles maybe you you were like a tournament 50 battle points maybe i'll try i have a good team i'm glad that rilla boom is gone i'm not really following the format let me let me let me tell you what's happening here we right now are in series six a couple podcasts ago i think three podcasts ago we talked about how series six introduced the first time ever mid well that's a weird sentence because technically in sun and moon there was the sun cup the moon cup and then the ultra cup and they had different rules and regulations and different pokemon were banned and not banned and but in sword and shield uh every series so far has introduced new pokemon such as you know you couldn't use gigantomax lapras in series one or series two but when series three came out people were able to use gigantomax lapras and that became very dominant for a time and then when the isle of armor came out which was series five uh you could use pokemon like hidden ability rillaboom magnazone or pouring on two because those are all pokemon introduced in the isle of armor but this is the first time since sword and shield they have said pokemon are not allowed to be used which we covered there were 16 pokemon banned some of them being the popular pokemon that you you've always heard about in competitive in cinerore rilla boom porygon 2 toga kiss all these pokemon were banned and we have been in series six ever since september first so two weeks now this announcement came originally in pokemon home where in pokemon home in the announcement in pokemon home it says series 6 rules but on pokemon.com and i think on the japanesepokemon.com it said series five so there was this conflicting of well one is the pokemon company is really good at doing this they're really good at one site saying something like for example the japanese pokemon website said that what event was it oh it was the pikachu outbreak event the japanese pokemon website said the pikachu opera outbreak event was only for the weekend and then a day later the english pokemon website said oh it was two weeks long and at that point as a standard pokemon consumer who maybe doesn't check the the japanese pokemon website because maybe you're an american and you're like why would i ever go to the japanese pokemon website i that you would think that pokemon.com the english pokemon website would be trustworthy there was clearly a communication error and this has been kind of happening a lot recently i feel like it's happening more frequently uh now that we have the japanese pokemon website which uh sarah b usually pulls from the japanese pokemon website only because the japanese pokemon website is normally first and then we have the american pokemon website and then we have the pokemon twitter and then we have pokemon home now which is also providing news and we we frequently keep getting wrong information between one of the four but this was not an error here they're sticking with the series five rules it's on pokemon.com it's on the japanese pokemon website it's updated in pokemon home and then the twitter has then play at play poke that's also confusing because there's multiple pokemon twitters there's at pokemon and then there's at pokemon underscore jp and then there's at play pokemon but the at play pokemon twitter did say sorry for the confusion we are using series 5. now you might say steve why is that this isn't a big deal a lot you know series six is only two weeks old a lot of people still have their teams from series five they still got their token kisses their rillabooms you know these pokemon just didn't disintegrate when we started the series six rules this is the problem there is no way to practice your series five teams because the game banned these pokemon i have i cannot look there's a tournament coming up most people you know practice for tournaments and you have introduced now a tournament for a rule set that you've banned so what you're telling me no no no no you're wrong because you you can do your own custom rules unless they've changed that you could so you go and the thing is like what you're saying is you can't practice against randos what i would argue with some of the best practice maybe they don't want you to have good practice you can practice with friends you can yes the pokemon company the tpci the people that work at the seattle office i know quite a few of them why aren't you introducing me to these fine folks i know i i know some of them listen to the podcast some of them follow me on twitter lawsuit oh it's it there's this lawsuit is so long 2021 going gonna be a great year for lawyers they they're probably not the ones that made this decision that's not what i'm getting at the people in the seattle office but they there's not a they know that people use outside sources right there there's smogon there's piqualytics there's pokemon showdown there's there's uh all these things outside of pokemon the game that people use to get teams ready to practice to check calculations all that stuff tpc eyes are well aware of this but it's still frustrating as a as a player to be like you're introducing an old rule set of pokemon you just banned everyone was excited i i made there maybe there was like four people out there that was like i really like the rilla boom i was very dominant with the grass and glide i'm very upset about the band i'm sure that person exists that's fine but the general feeling which you know when we when we we go out here on the internet and we we check the twitters and the reddits and the facebooks and the no one's checking facebook and the discords and there's always a general feeling of like are people happy with this or are people not happy with this and the general feeling for series 6 was people were happy and now you announced the players cup 2 which people were happy and and for for about 12 hours people were happy but slightly confused of where this typo was everyone thought series 5 is just a typo right we just flipped to series 6. just just the typo they're gonna check the the pokemon home says series six website says siri five there's no way that this is going to be series five and then they they announce that oh sorry for the confusion we're doing series five and in will is right you can go into a private battle in sword and shield i i i can send you a an eight-digit code you know four four four six nine six nine and i can battle will nice with with my rilla boom and my toga kiss and my incineroar and my porygon too but i cannot just go to the ladder and play or i can go to showdown but still i i don't i don't know what they're what are they trying to do here why why why is there just like one person in like japan making these decisions and they're just like well just siri like it's not that big of a deal just series five do they not play the video game do they not know that their players can't use rillaboom on the ladder like i i don't understand i was watching oh gosh i can't remember his name right now it's at the tip of my tongue the the dude who who uh the korean player very good pacharisu player season park yeah i was watching him the other day on twitch i watched him get to number one in the world you he was when i was when i started watching him he was like 300th in the world he kept winning he won like 17 games in a row he was using uh all he was using non-banned pokemon because he was playing the ladder he was you know he's using drift bloom he's using arcanine uh very cool to see and easy to watch even though i don't understand a lick of korean i understand what you know i don't need to know korean to understand when you use the dark type move on arcanine that's definitely snarls hitting both pokemon stuff very nice very good very nice guy and at one point he just went from korean to english and out of nowhere just goes why is it not series six for the player's cup and then everyone is typing in karina then he just switched back to korea and i was like i just oh yeah i just don't get it i just i can't i can say the other thing also is you mentioned that people go to outside sources for their like data and everything yes yeah um so maybe they just realized that everybody does all their practicing on pokemon showdown and they're like why should we bother with our stuff when people are just going to go to showdown anyways yeah but the reason i wouldn't want to so this is just a personal reason this is probably definitely not applying to a lot of competitive players i mean but sage and obviously practicing in sword and shield as they climbed the ladder right yeah but i mean he started out as a tcg player what does that dude know but the the nice thing about practicing in sword and shield is be you're getting rewarded for your time right you are getting you are getting battle points you're getting um protein you're getting uh beep you're getting bottle caps you are getting actual items for climbing the ladder even if you're already at master rink like every battle they give you something the meta might be slightly different in sword and shield than it would be on pokemon showdown and the reason i say that is because metas are different per metas are different in real life right like if i was to play a pokemon tcg tournament in milwaukee there might be a different meta than in [ __ ] rapids in minnesota and that's an actual real life example where i think in milwaukee it was very dark cry heavy and then in [ __ ] rapids when i played at a tournament it was gosh what were they playing at the time it was like electric or something but metas are different per yeah territory i i don't think that applies to showdown just because showdown would have the same international player base as if you were going into your actual game and doing practices it's the same people i just can't think of the reason why they besides somebody being like it's besides like well besides somebody be like ah no just do it series five where how is this benefiting anyone just you don't want people to practice go in fresh yeah it's a whole new world they're living in even even okay here's here's my last point before we move on even if you did not care about participating in the players cup and then there's like four people listening to this podcast being like yes say it i don't care about this at all even if you don't care about participating but you wanted just to watch other people battle right there is an appeal to watching people battle even though you don't battle yourself you've already seen all these pokemon fight before i've already seen the rilla booms do the grassy glides and the the uh toga kisses using the follow me and the porygon using the trick rooms i've already seen that i already saw the last player cup i've already saw the last two months of series five since since june when when all these pokemon got introduced like the willow boom and and porygon it would be exciting as a viewer who is not participating to be like oh cool i'm getting i'm getting like that's the reason i was watching sagen i was like i have driftwood sweet well it knows gus no one's using gust in 2020. no one was using gus in 1988 yeah but that dude uses some weird tactics [Laughter] so it's exciting to see new pokemon battle and now we're just gonna see rillaboom and incineroar and togekiss and porygon and i'm sure people are creative and they'll probably they'll probably be you know a couple cool things but it's this is just frustrating i hope that somebody is fighting hard to change this to series six before then but this i just yeah and i just i don't wanna go back to series five it's not gonna happen give up hope if they were they i guess they could have been like here's this here's it's series five but here is the thing you go into to do practice matches against other series five teams you have no option of doing that you can only just do friend matches at this point that's it that's all the pokemon is it's dumb it is exciting for a second players cup i'm assuming there will probably be a third player's cup because there you go that means we're getting we'll get another season of the uh pokemon champions podcast and i guess this is happening before we're right because crown tundra ain't coming out in the next two weeks so nope i'm assuming there will be another player's cup based off the pokemon added to crown tundra yeah after that uh brandon thank you for sending in the players cup stuff and that wasn't slack oh last bit of news is from andrew in our slack community if you go to a pokemon center in japan between september 12th and november 1st and say zhu man baruto which is thunderbolt in japanese they will give you a sticker breaking news right there no other sticker of i don't know that's a really good question it is a sticker and you have over a month to do it well we need our japanese correspondent to take pictures of said sticker and and let us know what we're getting for our thunderbolt chant this if if the sticker was that good and if i could book a flight to japan and if there wasn't a pandemic you better believe i'd be there question of the week these questions all i ever wanted these questions go and ask away this time for the question of the week is that bananarama are the bengals the go-go's the go-go's when you pick two out of three i was not a bengals fan i was okay with bananarama sometimes i was a huge go-go's fan though i mean yeah was it uh jade jane wiedland was she in the legos yeah yeah that was my first concert i got to pick for myself this is from robert what are your thoughts on automated shiny hunting automated shiny hunting they've gone too far i also don't know what that means i don't know what that means i can only think of two right now um so one would be i mean i feel like clicking the pokeball during go and just seeing if you get shiny is automated is that kind of that automatic yeah i would say that's probably automated i think that's automated i mean you're not you're not doing the action yourself for clicking the button well i mean you are pressing the button but if you wrapped a rubber band around the button so it's already being pressed then i think you're maybe i'm automating but then to do this for my bike rides you shouldn't i finally found my second pokeball thing so i can get my i can hook up to sword and shield setting up a new room is is really helpful for finding things you thought you lost so there's there's three automations i can think of the first one is the easiest one you would get a turbo controller and then in sword and shield you could have it press a over and over again and you could fossil hunt all you're doing is getting fossils from the lady right careless right there's no work involved there right you just you set up the turbo controller you press a you have you know 200 plus fossils you come back in 45 minutes you check the pokedex to see if there's a shiny that would be the fastest way instead of going through all 200. there is no one you reset and then you tell her to do it again and come back in 45 minutes so that's one way to automate another way would be that somebody this is way more complicated but somebody built a like a lego thing that would press the a button on the 3ds and then there was like was it this is really this is really complicated but i think there's a raspberry pi and it listened for the shiny sparkles uh and they would do it for chain fishing and if it heard the sparkle sound it would stop pressing the a button so then you would come you would come back to your 3ds and then you would be like oh there's a shiny rem raid on screen because the the the bot knew how to how to chain fish okay i'm not gonna give my opinions about these yet third way would be same thing as fossil hunting in in sword and shield but in let's go pikachu let's go eevee uh you could open up a joy con and then hook up a raspberry pi to hit the button over and over because you have to use a joy con you can't use a turbo controller but you would same thing you would fossil hunt uh for omanite or kabuto or or aerodactyl and then another way would be that you could buy it was again a raspberry pi but you would hook it up to your joy-con and then you would you would you would do what's called pathing so you would um drive your bike in a circle talk to the lady drive your bike in a circle talk to the lady and then the the raspberry pi would remember the motions so you could then egg hatch by not doing anything because your what you've programmed it to do just remembers the go into a circle talk to the lady throw away the pokemon go in a circle talk to a lady and then it would hatch a bunch of eggs or you would i think that might be a two-step you might have it where the first step of the automation is to get the eggs and then the second step of the once you have like a million eggs the second step is just spin in a circle let it hatch spin a circle let it hatch and then you check all of the eggs afterwards to see if there's a shiny then you delete using pokemon home so those are a couple ways you could automate pokemon hunts okay i have my thoughts on them i don't know if now that i've explained i don't know if you guys have any thoughts um i don't care like i so it's again it's the fallacy of time spent right like it's this oh i spent 15 hours hunting this and so mine is more valuable or more earned whereas you got your shiny ferramosa in one shot i did yeah does that make that any less valuable than if you had a the 5 000 chain that you had or whatever it was for wheezing no it is an alternate color that you cleverly found a way to do cool you have it people will care about it for literally half a second they'll look at it oh cool and then judge you based off of completely pointless criteria because it didn't take you 15 hours or you found a way to do it better yeah yeah it kind of reminds me of um i'm not going to say his name but a friend of mine who commented on my current snomed shiny hunt that it is my last shiny hunt that i am certainly not doing automated uh and they asked whether i was doing um hidden ability i was like no but hidden abilities better and i was like i just i'm just trying to get a shiny here i'm not trying to get good ivs or or anything i'm not trying to make competitive i just want a little shiny ice bug that's all i want yeah i just uh people put way too much thought into these things build a machine to like recognize a shiny sparkle i think that's really cool i mean that it is very clever that's very cool but i don't think i would do it myself but i wouldn't i wouldn't like i would i would know how to do it i wouldn't judge the person to be like oh well you you went to school and you came back and there was a shiny on your screen like you know you built a sweet machine to do it that sounds awesome man like cool yeah more power to you it means the same sort of weird like our chinese too common now you got a clickbait like no they're not whatever like it is an alternate color that literally does nothing who like why why do you care this much about the legitimacy of this other than you want to feel superior to somebody else i think it's just it's that weird superiority thing like i i did this in this amount of time or this natural way and mine is therefore more legitimate and it's just it's a weird thing to put on data i mean as those of us born in the 70s say you know that shiny and a coupon will get you a discount on a shamrock shake i think for the the the the easy thing that anyone can do the only thing good at mcdonald's is the shamrock shake i'm just gonna put that out there right now i had a quarter pound last night it was very good you are taste buds are i'm not gonna get into this after the after the little caesars pizza fiasco i would be more insulted if somebody didn't use a turbo controller to hunt fossils because i don't own a turbo controller if you're gonna if you're gonna sit there and press the a button a million times one your hand is gonna get tired you gotta take care of your hands and get the carpal's tunnels two your controller is only prorated for so many button presses and do you wanna waste all your button presses what if i tape a penny on the a button on my controller no because that's not pressing it over and over again oh i think if you're buying if you're using a turbo controller on fossils i just think you're a lot smarter than the average person you're protecting look a pro controller for the nintendo switch is like 69 it's very expensive you don't want to wear that out to get a slightly different colored pokemon get yourself a turbo controller here's the problem the fossils and sword and shield are garbage oh they're so shiny [Music] it's not always black and white but your heart always knows the draco fish is right yeah i like jacob i like a lot of those i don't if if somebody if somebody is arguing that you bought a turbo controller and you're not a true pokemon fan and you didn't press the a button 20 000 times to get a shiny draco fish cut ties with that person they're no longer your friend yeah i uh okay no more keeping i am fine with people building robots to do their shiny hunting for them if that's what automated shiny hunting means i am not okay with rng which i don't even know if rng is possible anymore but that old style of you know alternating the clock on your 3ds or your ds so that you would be like change the percentage chance for a shiny encounter etc not that's no good because that's just hacking the game taking i don't know manipulation yep i would i would say manipulation and automation are not the same yes agreed pokemon of the week oh boy oh boy all right last week's pokemon because we're building up well building up to this week but it was just a list of words i'll just go through those words again because i'm sure greg has it years diplodocy idea i can't pronounce that warning tyrunt ice borealis 100 monster snow amargasaurus fossil refrigerate rock million sail tundra aura and sauropod those were your words who is your pokemon it's paracosta close close uh i have written down amora amora is correct oh why is it one one of my all-time favorite fossils amorous is what well you listed all the words and it could have been amora or morris what was the word that said it was amoris and not amora versus auroras auroras oh yeah aurora sorry i kept the m in there when it evolved okay the word in there that would indicate to you that it is not the evolved version is tyrant oh okay which is the other fossil that is what you get from the fossil not from evolving the fossil i see pay attention to all the words real good shuffle like oh i didn't know it i just really liked it did you yeah the shiny is so good i said that last week that shiny is amazing the shiny is amazing i have to i i'm going to start shiny hunting in amore now because yeah i must have that there is a wasp on my window that is huge it's a bedroom mega medrill confirmed it certainly has come out um can you can you is amara in the shortened shield no dang it well i mean i still got my 3ds i mean i do too but okay some trivia here is amora was designed by hitoshi agri ar argeya they have designed ironically enough mega beedrill hey the alolan geodude line the alolan grimer line pangoro enkei and malamar uh the aegislash line uh the tyrant and the amora line the gruben vika volta line i don't know why i just didn't just say grubbin charger bug biker volt minier drampa they helped with ultra necrozma and in sword and shield they made the rickety corvus squire and corvinite line man i like pretty much everything designs yeah everything in this list is really good yeah yeah dang they gotta so they would have started with sun and moon i guess yeah right no if they did mega well mega biedra was oh mega beedrill was was old ruby omega b applesat there you go they got they got real strong pokemon yeah drampa drampa though drama's good so good yeah they're good their favorite pokemon according to bulbapedia is miss grievous really i like a mysterious i do too all right you ready for this week's pokemon uh yeah all right i mean you guys you already know what the clue is i've been saying this for over a month no that's that's an answer that's not a clue oh shout out can be a clue don't judge chat wasp no what have i been saying that the clue was gonna be one letter one letter that is the clue one letter of all the pokemon unless i am grievously mistaken there is only one that can in any language be clearly identified by one letter that's your pokemon of the week chat sure i'll repeat it in case somebody was distracted by all of your tomfoolery the clue for this week's pokemon of the week is one letter of all the pokemon unless i am grievously mistaken there is only one that can in any language be clearly identified by one letter that's our episode we'll be back next week although we'll be probably recording a little earlier than sunday because sunday is porygon day yeah we're gonna go to brunch but i don't think there's there's usually not breaking pokemon news saturday and sunday but i'm sure the one weekend where we decide not to record on sunday there will probably be the release date will hit well then you can do a do-do-do-do well we only have to we have to save that for really important news it could be like how to say squelve it right announce a new pokemon game pokemon cafe mix two pokemon v electric boogaloo what are they gonna do dream world to oh they need to bring that dream world yeah they do remakes confirmed we did a charity event this weekend for starlight uh which uh is a charity that raises money for sick kids in hospitals uh so they they use the money and get the kids like books and um video game systems like ds's they actually work they actually work directly with nintendo so they provide kids like dss and switches and stuff like nintendo switches not like internet switches i mean maybe the kid is like super into that and they want to like or light switches or light switches thank you to everyone who

polls and you want to see me lose my mind slowly because i spent 30 000 gems that is on youtube and you still didn't get leave still do not have leave i also have a video up on youtube of how i got all the vivian forms for in pokemon home so if you're trying to get there are 18 forms that you can get naturally through regions and there are two exclusive forms the fancy form and the pokeball form

work just putting up your own vivian mine was polar uh and then waiting for the other vivians to come to you and if there's any if there is anything that signifies that japan loves pokemon more than the rest of the world check out the gts and see how many elegance are on there it is nothing but elegance because japan is still trying they they love their vivian yep um so that video is up as well
