a feeling I&#39;m going to get a D in (0:40 - 0:44)
Pokemon sleep this week if not an (0:41 - 0:47)
F but I&#39;m here going on your permanent (0:44 - 0:50)
record it&#39;s gonna follow you to Pokemon (0:47 - 0:53)
sleep ex no I don&#39;t have premium it&#39;ll (0:50 - 0:57)
disappear after a month or so (0:53 - 0:57)
uh okay we got uh we got a show for you (1:01 - 1:05)
guys today we&#39;re actually going to start (1:03 - 1:07)
off with Pokemon go because the gmax (1:05 - 1:08)
stuff is here so we&#39;re going to get that (1:07 - 1:11)
out of the way and then um we have some (1:08 - 1:14)
scarlet and violet news after the break (1:11 - 1:17)
unfortunately no Pokemon sleep well look (1:14 - 1:19)
we can always talk about Pokemon sleep (1:17 - 1:22)
that&#39;s not an issue but uh when you&#39;re (1:19 - 1:24)
listening to this the Halloween event (1:22 - 1:26)
should be starting and Mimi Q should be (1:24 - 1:30)
showing up there was no Shadow drop of (1:26 - 1:34)
adding Nike fuel ban to Pokemon sleep or (1:30 - 1:35)
anything like (1:34 - 1:38)
that (1:35 - 1:40)
unfortunately that&#39;s a very specific one (1:38 - 1:42)
presumably that ties into Apple Health (1:40 - 1:43)
though (1:42 - 1:46)
right yeah but it only works with I mean (1:43 - 1:48)
I I would assume so but it only works (1:46 - 1:50)
with the Apple watch it doesn&#39;t work (1:48 - 1:51)
with the other things that tie into (1:50 - 1:53)
Apple Health they did however turn the (1:51 - 1:56)
default on so you can see what device (1:53 - 1:58)
everyone&#39;s using now I saw unless (1:56 - 2:00)
somebody opts out yeah (1:58 - 2:03)
I think it&#39;s out by default right not (2:00 - 2:06)
anymore was Chang (2:03 - 2:08)
yesterday one of the few days I opened (2:06 - 2:11)
sleep and noticed that and went not sure (2:08 - 2:13)
how I feel about changing a privacy (2:11 - 2:16)
default like that but okay yeah I I&#39;m (2:13 - 2:18)
like I am I am almost always on the side (2:16 - 2:21)
of like let me opt into something (2:18 - 2:24)
MH I don&#39;t know what the Privacy would (2:21 - 2:26)
be to be like I see Hannah&#39;s using an (2:24 - 2:29)
iPad but Al is using a (2:26 - 2:31)
Fitbit I wish love if it specifically (2:29 - 2:33)
said what device you were (2:31 - 2:37)
on not not just watch or phone like it (2:33 - 2:39)
would be like a Hannah&#39;s been lying to (2:37 - 2:41)
me for years she&#39;s told me she&#39;s never (2:39 - 2:44)
had an (2:41 - 2:44)
iPad yeah it&#39;s a that&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s (2:47 - 2:53)
a different privacy that&#39;s for (2:50 - 2:55)
sure yeah it&#39;s not the biggest thing (2:53 - 2:57)
that&#39;s why I wasn&#39;t like raging on the (2:55 - 2:59)
internet about it but it&#39;s still a (2:57 - 3:01)
little bit like it&#39;s not a great (2:59 - 3:05)
principle but anyway yeah yeah um (3:01 - 3:08)
speaking of maybe not great I I don&#39;t (3:05 - 3:12)
know uh that was my transition (3:08 - 3:16)
gigantamax Pokemon in Pokemon go uh that (3:12 - 3:20)
that that has arrived this weekend I (3:16 - 3:23)
will uh I&#39;m just just for those that (3:20 - 3:25)
maybe don&#39;t follow go I think I think (3:23 - 3:27)
this is going to be an interesting (3:25 - 3:29)
conversation but this is off (3:27 - 3:31)
pokemon.com power up your Dynamax (3:29 - 3:34)
Pokemon for the Epic gigantamax debut of (3:31 - 3:36)
Venusaur Charizard (3:34 - 3:38)
Blastoise uh we&#39;ve seen Mega Evolve (3:36 - 3:40)
we&#39;ve seen Primal we&#39;ve seen Dynamax at (3:38 - 3:43)
long last gigantamax will appear (3:40 - 3:45)
starting October 26 that was this (3:43 - 3:48)
weekend from 10 a.m. to 8:00 pm they&#39;re (3:45 - 3:51)
saying that these are six star Max raid (3:48 - 3:53)
battles and they&#39;re saying they will (3:51 - 3:57)
require between 10 to 40 (3:53 - 4:00)
trainers uh (3:57 - 4:02)
and they also say Max particles used to (4:00 - 4:04)
participate you can use max particles to (4:02 - 4:06)
teach your Dynamax Pokemon Max moves or (4:04 - 4:08)
to power up Max moves you can collect up (4:06 - 4:11)
to 800 particles per day and you cannot (4:08 - 4:15)
acquire more than 1,000 particles kind (4:11 - 4:18)
of technically yes you can&#39;t it can&#39;t (4:15 - 4:21)
get more than 800 unless you do in which (4:18 - 4:23)
case you can get up to what (4:21 - 4:26)
10,060 I think it is is yeah yeah yeah (4:23 - 4:28)
or 1,60 sorry not (4:26 - 4:32)
10,060 yeah there like a weird overflow (4:28 - 4:36)
threshold you can do mhm um okay I I (4:32 - 4:40)
went out I did gigantamax battles Al (4:36 - 4:42)
what is your status on the gigantamax (4:40 - 4:47)
weekend H I also did it uh so I guess um (4:42 - 4:48)
I I was saying on the podcast I&#39;m (4:47 - 4:49)
probably not going to do it and then (4:48 - 4:52)
afterwards I realized I haven&#39;t been I (4:49 - 4:54)
haven&#39;t tried to take my 5-year-old out (4:52 - 4:56)
to Pok√©mon event for a long time so (4:54 - 4:58)
maybe he&#39;ll be less annoying if I do it (4:56 - 4:59)
this time so he was up for that and we (4:58 - 5:02)
went out and we actually you know not (4:59 - 5:04)
trying to say I don&#39;t have issues with (5:02 - 5:05)
this I&#39;m sure we can talk about them but (5:04 - 5:07)
overall I had a fun time it was a fun (5:05 - 5:10)
event we had like over a 100 people in (5:07 - 5:13)
Edinburgh um so we got most people (5:10 - 5:15)
caught most of them I caught all three (5:13 - 5:16)
which I&#39;m happy I fact I I think I did a (5:15 - 5:18)
second Charizard at the end and caught (5:16 - 5:21)
that as well so that&#39;s why I did uh (5:18 - 5:26)
Hannah did you go out I did not but I (5:21 - 5:28)
stalked Discord I stalked all the (5:26 - 5:31)
discords I stalked all the campfires (5:28 - 5:33)
nearby I was trying to figure out (5:31 - 5:36)
exactly what everybody was feeling about (5:33 - 5:38)
all of this so my head is packed full of (5:36 - 5:42)
opinions oh okay okay okay was (5:38 - 5:46)
was I was I was with a group of people (5:42 - 5:47)
and they were like I can&#39;t wait for you (5:46 - 5:49)
to talk about this on the podcast and I (5:47 - 5:51)
was like yeah I i&#39; I heard Al had a good (5:49 - 5:53)
time and I was like I don&#39;t know if (5:51 - 5:55)
Hannah&#39;s going out or not it&#39;s but I am (5:53 - 5:56)
like I don&#39;t give you guys homework it&#39;s (5:55 - 5:59)
not like Hannah you need how dare you (5:56 - 6:02)
not go out this weekend I wish I had (5:59 - 6:05)
been able to so I I soon I will be able (6:02 - 6:09)
to more easily travel places I got uh (6:05 - 6:11)
new mode of transportation recently and (6:09 - 6:13)
soon I will be able to get to the (6:11 - 6:16)
campfire groups that are in my city but (6:13 - 6:18)
at this point in time that&#39;s still not (6:16 - 6:21)
quite an option yet okay okay but (6:18 - 6:24)
soon um I I want to get this disclosure (6:21 - 6:27)
out of the way just because I (6:24 - 6:29)
I I always feel like I need to get this (6:27 - 6:33)
disclosure Niantic paid me money to run (6:29 - 6:36)
an ad for the announcement of gigantamax (6:33 - 6:38)
Pokemon that that was on that was on (6:36 - 6:40)
Instagram and that was on Tik Tok and I (6:38 - 6:42)
think they they put money into it to (6:40 - 6:45)
make more people view it I made them (6:42 - 6:47)
like three different ads they didn&#39;t (6:45 - 6:49)
like two of them I liked the other two (6:47 - 6:52)
way more but they wanted they wanted a (6:49 - 6:54)
specific one I also just some behind the (6:52 - 6:56)
scenes it was originally 55 seconds it (6:54 - 6:58)
had a ton of information I thought it (6:56 - 7:01)
was very cohesive to me they did not (6:58 - 7:03)
want it to be 55 seconds they wanted to (7:01 - 7:07)
be under 30 seconds so anyways they paid (7:03 - 7:10)
me money to do an ad for an announcement (7:07 - 7:12)
of that I at that point have never (7:10 - 7:15)
played the gigantamax feature I did not (7:12 - 7:18)
know if it was good or bad that ad was (7:15 - 7:22)
done over a week ago so like my opinions (7:18 - 7:24)
of this feature have (7:22 - 7:27)
no like they are not really I&#39;m not (7:24 - 7:29)
getting paid whether I&#39;m saying on this (7:27 - 7:31)
show whether they&#39;re good or bad it was (7:29 - 7:34)
a specifically that 29 second ad that (7:31 - 7:38)
you saw um so that just I want to get (7:34 - 7:39)
that disclosure out of the way just so (7:38 - 7:41)
because I&#39;m I&#39;m probably going to be a (7:39 - 7:42)
little positive on this and people are (7:41 - 7:44)
gonna be like well I antic paid you no (7:42 - 7:46)
they they paid me to announce it they (7:44 - 7:47)
did not pay me to say good things about (7:46 - 7:49)
it and I&#39;m very good at saying bad (7:47 - 7:51)
things about some of the things they do (7:49 - 7:54)
in this game you are you are both (7:51 - 7:55)
negative about everything and you&#39;re a (7:54 - 8:00)
shill that&#39;s just how it work (7:55 - 8:02)
actually put that on my (8:00 - 8:05)
resume Al you said you had a 100 people (8:02 - 8:08)
in edin Edinburg is that the city is (8:05 - 8:11)
called Edinburgh yeah Edinburgh (8:08 - 8:16)
edin yeah campfire it was campfire yeah (8:11 - 8:19)
so there&#39;s I believe there are two (8:16 - 8:20)
Community ambassadors in Scotland a (8:19 - 8:24)
whole two of them uh basically one each (8:20 - 8:26)
one in each of the B country (8:24 - 8:28)
Steve you know it&#39;s not a very big (8:26 - 8:32)
country well no basically there&#39;s like (8:28 - 8:36)
if you live in the central belt you&#39;re (8:32 - 8:38)
probably like less than an hour&#39;s drive (8:36 - 8:40)
away from one of those two cities if you (8:38 - 8:44)
don&#39;t good (8:40 - 8:44)
luck there are more cities in Scotland (8:44 - 8:50)
but tough um yeah no there was a good a (8:46 - 8:52)
really good turnout and it was kind of (8:50 - 8:53)
big enough that people split up into (8:52 - 8:57)
multiple groups to do it um and uh yeah (8:53 - 8:59)
use campfire would have been nice if one (8:57 - 9:01)
was closer but but it&#39;s not I&#39;m not too (8:59 - 9:03)
far away from Edinburgh so it&#39;s yeah it (9:01 - 9:05)
was what what was the what was the (9:03 - 9:07)
commitment what was the like the drive (9:05 - 9:09)
you and you brought your son uh so I (9:07 - 9:11)
didn&#39;t actually drive uh because I&#39;m not (9:09 - 9:14)
in America um I got we got the train in (9:11 - 9:17)
that was part of the deal right Craig uh (9:14 - 9:19)
my 5-year-old he loves going on trains (9:17 - 9:21)
so it&#39;s like well we can go on the train (9:19 - 9:23)
we can get into Edinburgh we&#39;ll go do go (9:21 - 9:25)
get a McDonalds do the Pokemon thing and (9:23 - 9:27)
then you can choose something to do um (9:25 - 9:29)
so he sound very American minus the (9:27 - 9:31)
train (9:29 - 9:31)
well no because we walked when we were (9:32 - 9:36)
in the city oh yeah that&#39;s not American (9:33 - 9:38)
at (9:36 - 9:41)
all um (9:38 - 9:44)
yeah uh okay okay uh and you said you (9:41 - 9:45)
had over a 100 (9:44 - 9:48)
people yeah yeah I didn&#39;t count exactly (9:45 - 9:50)
but it was like we there was a point (9:48 - 9:54)
where I think we filled three so 340 so (9:50 - 9:54)
over (9:54 - 9:57)
120 um it kind of weighed around a (9:54 - 9:59)
little bit sometimes there were not (9:57 - 10:01)
quite enough for sometimes there were a (9:59 - 10:02)
little bit more which was I guess the (10:01 - 10:03)
most annoying bit is when you had a (10:02 - 10:05)
little bit more because one thing I will (10:03 - 10:07)
say is this feature doesn&#39;t have the (10:05 - 10:09)
private groups like raids do so you (10:07 - 10:12)
can&#39;t split people up into oh you guys (10:09 - 10:15)
you you just have to be patient you just (10:12 - 10:16)
have to wait yeah have you ever tried to (10:15 - 10:19)
organize 120 people to (10:16 - 10:23)
wait maybe possibly hey that&#39;s up to (10:19 - 10:25)
that that&#39;s up to that Community manager (10:23 - 10:28)
to community ambassador to I looked like (10:25 - 10:30)
hair and cats (10:28 - 10:32)
hon the Overflow groups with fewer than (10:30 - 10:36)
10 people in them just have no chance (10:32 - 10:39)
yeah yeah yeah yeah uh so what what (10:36 - 10:44)
would you say the the vibe was with your (10:39 - 10:46)
groups did like were there a lot of (10:44 - 10:48)
fails were people having a good time was (10:46 - 10:52)
like what was the yeah I think I think (10:48 - 10:55)
the overall Vibe was I&#39;m glad we&#39;re (10:52 - 10:56)
getting these done like most of them (10:55 - 10:59)
were succeeding right the the 40s (10:56 - 11:00)
succeeded right you didn&#39;t need a huge (10:59 - 11:02)
amount of you only needed a few people (11:00 - 11:04)
who were like properly powered up and (11:02 - 11:06)
then most people could cheer them on and (11:04 - 11:07)
get the Dynamax meter up for them and (11:06 - 11:10)
that worked out quite well um I guess it (11:07 - 11:12)
was particularly frustrating when there (11:10 - 11:16)
was a group that didn&#39;t succeed and um (11:12 - 11:18)
it&#39;s one of those things I guess where (11:16 - 11:20)
they felt a little bit kind of grumpy (11:18 - 11:22)
coming out to an event and having this (11:20 - 11:24)
many people and they couldn&#39;t actually (11:22 - 11:27)
do the battle and succeed um play (11:24 - 11:30)
scarland Violet (11:27 - 11:32)
they should do some sevenstar raids so (11:30 - 11:34)
wait there were groups of 40 that (11:32 - 11:35)
weren&#39;t succeeding not groups of 40 no (11:34 - 11:37)
no no so there were smaller groups so I (11:35 - 11:40)
think there was a group of and I suspect (11:37 - 11:42)
this happened time and time again in (11:40 - 11:44)
other places there was a group of about (11:42 - 11:46)
27 that didn&#39;t succeed which you would (11:44 - 11:49)
think probably should be able to succeed (11:46 - 11:51)
but a lot of people depend on how (11:49 - 11:52)
prepared you are well that&#39;s the thing a (11:51 - 11:55)
lot of people were not prepared at all (11:52 - 11:58)
um like I saw many people going in with (11:55 - 12:00)
Bulbasaur and gas and stuff like (11:58 - 12:03)
and we could easily finish it with them (12:00 - 12:05)
in the 40 raids but when you were less (12:03 - 12:07)
than 30 there was no chance of doing it (12:05 - 12:09)
with people like that um people like (12:07 - 12:13)
that um G how so judgy if I been able to (12:09 - 12:14)
make it out to the raids I would have (12:13 - 12:16)
been a person like (12:14 - 12:19)
that I will say so we did Charizard (12:16 - 12:22)
first uh and that was um probably the (12:19 - 12:24)
hardest one that we did once everybody (12:22 - 12:26)
had caught a Charizard the the Venusaur (12:24 - 12:29)
was super easy like we got the Venusaur (12:26 - 12:32)
done with like 40 or 50 Pokemon (12:29 - 12:33)
remaining and then everybody caught a (12:32 - 12:37)
Venusaur and the Blastoise get took (12:33 - 12:39)
about the same sort of time so having (12:37 - 12:40)
those three that all countered each (12:39 - 12:42)
other definitely helped but obviously (12:40 - 12:44)
the first one was quite difficult (12:42 - 12:47)
actually taking it down um there was one (12:44 - 12:49)
particularly exciting point and this is (12:47 - 12:51)
this is definitely the positive of it is (12:49 - 12:55)
there was a one that had about 25 people (12:51 - 12:57)
in it or something and they were getting (12:55 - 12:59)
very close they were like in the red and (12:57 - 13:01)
but they had like 15 Pok√©mon remaining (12:59 - 13:03)
or something like that and you just saw (13:01 - 13:04)
it going down and down and the number of (13:03 - 13:06)
Pokemon by the end there was literally (13:04 - 13:08)
one Pokemon remaining and they did (13:06 - 13:10)
succeed but it was like quite I mean I I (13:08 - 13:12)
I think that person felt great about (13:10 - 13:13)
themselves right last last person (13:12 - 13:16)
standing taking it down um and that was (13:13 - 13:18)
kind of like a really exciting moment (13:16 - 13:19)
because we&#39;d just done a 40 that (13:18 - 13:22)
succeeded and then there was this 25 but (13:19 - 13:24)
yeah it obviously frustrating if they (13:22 - 13:26)
hadn&#39;t done it but I think overall (13:24 - 13:27)
people were happy to do them but (13:26 - 13:29)
definitely thought they were like it (13:27 - 13:32)
feels like there&#39;s a a we we&#39;ve gotten (13:29 - 13:33)
to the point where it&#39;s Dynamax right (13:32 - 13:35)
you&#39;ve got the three you&#39;ve got the one (13:33 - 13:36)
Stars the six one star or seven one (13:35 - 13:38)
stars that we&#39;ve done and there was one (13:36 - 13:40)
three star which maybe sometimes would (13:38 - 13:41)
need two people you could do it on your (13:40 - 13:44)
own if if you had good power um there (13:41 - 13:45)
was technically two three stars there (13:44 - 13:48)
was the Beldum and failinks Beldum I (13:45 - 13:49)
forgot about Beldum that one was that (13:48 - 13:52)
one was a lot easier than failinks I (13:49 - 13:55)
thought but maybe I&#39;m (13:52 - 13:57)
misremembering yeah I think yeah cuz (13:55 - 14:00)
Charmander could like you could just (13:57 - 14:02)
bring three Charmeleon or Charizards or (14:00 - 14:05)
whatnot but it felt like the difficulty (14:02 - 14:09)
curve from solo and then maybe two (14:05 - 14:12)
people needed for the next ones up to (14:09 - 14:14)
realistically you need 30 people to get (14:12 - 14:16)
this done felt a little bit steep you (14:14 - 14:19)
need for these raids you need more than (14:16 - 14:21)
twice as many people than in our hardest (14:19 - 14:23)
raids we&#39;ve in in the hardest raids (14:21 - 14:26)
we&#39;ve ever seen before MH I think that (14:23 - 14:28)
that&#39;s I think that that&#39;s a true (14:26 - 14:29)
statement even if you have full built (14:28 - 14:31)
teams I think that you need more than (14:29 - 14:32)
twice as many people for the hardest (14:31 - 14:34)
raids we&#39;ve seen before because I would (14:32 - 14:36)
argue that the hardest rids we&#39;ve seen (14:34 - 14:38)
before could be taken down by six or (14:36 - 14:40)
fewer people I think that for these you (14:38 - 14:42)
needed more than 12 when when when you (14:40 - 14:44)
mean (14:42 - 14:48)
hard I feel like that is just their HP (14:44 - 14:51)
is bigger and that&#39;s like the only (14:48 - 14:53)
difference so like when I think of like (14:51 - 14:58)
what is hard in a non in a I&#39;m going to (14:53 - 15:00)
call them traditional raids like the mhm (14:58 - 15:03)
anything before Dynamax and gigantamax (15:00 - 15:05)
in a traditional raid it&#39;s just like (15:03 - 15:07)
Mega Latias and Mega Latios are harder (15:05 - 15:09)
because they just have more (15:07 - 15:12)
HP it&#39;s not like they&#39;re doing anything (15:09 - 15:14)
different it&#39;s not like (15:12 - 15:16)
they&#39;re like if you&#39;re bringing proper (15:14 - 15:18)
counters you&#39;re still resisting two (15:16 - 15:20)
three moves before you get knocked out (15:18 - 15:21)
and you bring another Pokemon in but (15:20 - 15:23)
it&#39;s not like your strategy is changing (15:21 - 15:24)
it&#39;s (15:23 - 15:27)
just it&#39;s you&#39;re just sitting there (15:24 - 15:30)
longer I&#39;m I&#39;m not really even (15:27 - 15:31)
counting that as when I say hard I&#39;m (15:30 - 15:33)
just talking about how many people it (15:31 - 15:35)
takes to take this down so yes I suppose (15:33 - 15:38)
it means the HP and I&#39;m not let me be (15:35 - 15:40)
clear I am not going at this from a this (15:38 - 15:44)
is a bad thing oh sure yeah um I think (15:40 - 15:46)
it&#39;s nuanced and I think there are some (15:44 - 15:48)
things that really need to be changed (15:46 - 15:50)
but I think that it being this hard and (15:48 - 15:54)
taking this many people isn&#39;t a 100% bad (15:50 - 15:56)
thing but we do need to kind of (15:54 - 15:59)
acknowledge that these raids take more (15:56 - 16:01)
than twice as many people than for any (15:59 - 16:02)
raids we&#39;ve had (16:01 - 16:07)
before yeah yeah yeah the the for me the (16:02 - 16:10)
I I did 15 I successfully did 15 I guess (16:07 - 16:13)
you could say I did like 17 raids total (16:10 - 16:16)
I failed one and so many Max particles (16:13 - 16:20)
Steve yeah I know I know I was I I was (16:16 - 16:22)
having a fantastic time I&#39;m I&#39;m not (16:20 - 16:25)
exaggerating when I say that yes like I (16:22 - 16:26)
wish I would have been able to go out (16:25 - 16:28)
today but obviously we had to record the (16:26 - 16:30)
podcast um (16:28 - 16:32)
yesterday was probably the most fun I&#39;ve (16:30 - 16:36)
had in Pokemon go in a long time and I I (16:32 - 16:38)
I went to South Korea I went to I went (16:36 - 16:41)
to Jakarta I I went to all three go Fest (16:38 - 16:43)
but there was just something about (16:41 - 16:46)
yesterday that was just so fun to me and (16:43 - 16:47)
so again I I think I said this like last (16:46 - 16:49)
week I feel like I&#39;m in the minority of (16:47 - 16:51)
being like I love these raids and seeing (16:49 - 16:55)
so many people online or just in general (16:51 - 16:58)
you know also be frustrated or not like (16:55 - 17:02)
that I I had I did (16:58 - 17:05)
campfire uh and I&#39;m I have the little (17:02 - 17:07)
campfire up here uh the campfire (17:05 - 17:10)
Ambassador said 212 people checked in to (17:07 - 17:13)
Mo MOA mall America and 80 people (17:10 - 17:16)
checked in in Chicago Avenue actually (17:13 - 17:20)
don&#39;t know where that is um (17:16 - 17:23)
and everyone there all 200 some people (17:20 - 17:27)
all seem to be having a fantastic time (17:23 - 17:29)
so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s always I always take (17:27 - 17:31)
like the online opinions with a slight (17:29 - 17:34)
grain of salt of like everyone hates (17:31 - 17:37)
this feature or they need to really (17:34 - 17:39)
rework this entire thing and there are (17:37 - 17:43)
pros and cons of it (17:39 - 17:43)
but 200 like I don&#39;t think (17:43 - 17:50)
local thing like it&#39;s clearly not dead (17:46 - 17:52)
right like 200 people showing up for an (17:50 - 17:54)
event is really impressive and I&#39;m not (17:52 - 17:56)
even in the biggest city in America I&#39;m (17:54 - 17:58)
assuming but you&#39;re in a place where (17:56 - 17:59)
it&#39;s easy to play (17:58 - 18:01)
yeah it you went to a place where it&#39;s (17:59 - 18:04)
easy to play yeah it feels a little bit (18:01 - 18:05)
like selection bias saying everybody at (18:04 - 18:07)
the event enjoyed their time because (18:05 - 18:09)
they had enough people to do it right (18:07 - 18:11)
yes like no I mean look look I went I (18:09 - 18:13)
went to the the hoen tour in Las Vegas (18:11 - 18:15)
and the people that paid money to be (18:13 - 18:18)
there were not having a good time yeah (18:15 - 18:20)
but like Al was saying both of you went (18:18 - 18:22)
to a place that had a lot of people and (18:20 - 18:23)
that meant that both of you were able to (18:22 - 18:26)
do it kind of regardless of uh how many (18:23 - 18:29)
people there were prepared mhm anybody (18:26 - 18:32)
who was part of a smaller group and I (18:29 - 18:34)
was looking around none of my local (18:32 - 18:35)
discords were even trying to do this (18:34 - 18:37)
everybody was saying if you&#39;re trying to (18:35 - 18:39)
do this just go over to the campfire so (18:37 - 18:41)
that&#39;s actually a really cool sign of (18:39 - 18:44)
how big campfire is getting because (18:41 - 18:45)
nobody was even trying to organize this (18:44 - 18:47)
in Discord I don&#39;t even consider (18:45 - 18:50)
checking Discord or Facebook or anything (18:47 - 18:54)
I I campfire has been so reliable yeah (18:50 - 18:57)
and it in the last year I think my city (18:54 - 19:00)
has gotten three groups three Community (18:57 - 19:04)
groups the the officially sponsored ones (19:00 - 19:07)
um and all of them had I think at least (19:04 - 19:11)
40 people um but definitely not 100 (19:07 - 19:13)
definitely not (19:11 - 19:16)
200 and the groups that had the easiest (19:13 - 19:18)
time were the ones that came prepared as (19:16 - 19:22)
you would expect yeah and I (19:18 - 19:27)
think my opinion on this is that it (19:22 - 19:29)
being a challenge is a really good thing (19:27 - 19:33)
that having a new big hard challenging (19:29 - 19:36)
thing to do in Pokemon go is really good (19:33 - 19:38)
potentially but that the time (19:36 - 19:42)
gating is a huge issue that keeping this (19:38 - 19:45)
to one weekend keeping this to one hang (19:42 - 19:47)
on hang on hang on hang (19:45 - 19:50)
on keeping this to one weekend (19:47 - 19:54)
where not very few people were prepared (19:50 - 19:56)
the whole Dynamax thing is still new (19:54 - 19:58)
enough and not everybody has cared (19:56 - 20:00)
enough about it that very few people (19:58 - 20:03)
were prepared for this and that along (20:00 - 20:05)
with the fact that in raids before (20:03 - 20:08)
there&#39;s an there&#39;s always been a (20:05 - 20:09)
suggested number of people for (20:08 - 20:12)
traditional raids they would and that (20:09 - 20:14)
number has always been inflated has (20:12 - 20:16)
always been above what you actually need (20:14 - 20:18)
especially for when trainers have (20:16 - 20:19)
stronger (20:18 - 20:21)
teams the number that they gave for (20:19 - 20:23)
these raids for the new gigantamax raids (20:21 - 20:24)
was a little more (20:23 - 20:27)
accurate um and so people came into this (20:24 - 20:30)
unprepared and when people come into (20:27 - 20:33)
this unprepared in smaller groups so (20:30 - 20:35)
they are learning that you need a bigger (20:33 - 20:36)
group and you need to be prepared for (20:35 - 20:41)
these and it takes too long to build a (20:36 - 20:43)
team and it takes too many Max particles (20:41 - 20:46)
to build a team in an hour or two hours (20:43 - 20:50)
or in a day then on Saturday you go and (20:46 - 20:52)
you try to do the raids and you lose and (20:50 - 20:55)
you go oh I can&#39;t spend money on this I (20:52 - 20:57)
can&#39;t build a team by tomorrow or I (20:55 - 20:59)
don&#39;t have time to do this tomorrow I (20:57 - 21:02)
guess this is the only opportunity I had (20:59 - 21:03)
to do this (21:02 - 21:05)
then I think that it would be really (21:03 - 21:08)
really helpful if these were more of a (21:05 - 21:12)
monthlong thing than a weekend event I (21:08 - 21:15)
disagree I super disagree because I (21:12 - 21:18)
think if you do a two-day event you&#39;re (21:15 - 21:20)
forcing a sense of urgency of like I (21:18 - 21:21)
need to go out this weekend and I think (21:20 - 21:24)
we&#39;ve seen this very easily with Shadow (21:21 - 21:27)
raids shadow mewt shadow me well for (21:24 - 21:29)
that size of group (21:27 - 21:31)
yeah for this size of group and this (21:29 - 21:33)
level of preparation I think that you (21:31 - 21:35)
need to coordinate and plan more and I (21:33 - 21:36)
think that you need to have more time to (21:35 - 21:39)
be able to do that so so the thing that (21:36 - 21:42)
happened in in my raids is after (21:39 - 21:45)
everyone we again 200 plus people after (21:42 - 21:48)
everyone got one of each instantly cut (21:45 - 21:51)
in half yeah that&#39;s because nobody has (21:48 - 21:52)
Max particles because you had to pay (21:51 - 21:54)
money to get more than two of these (21:52 - 21:56)
rates the max particles isn&#39;t the (21:54 - 21:58)
problem though it&#39;s part of the problem (21:56 - 21:59)
it&#39;s not part of the problem (21:58 - 22:01)
because like you go out you go out on a (21:59 - 22:03)
Wednesday night to be like oh it&#39;s (22:01 - 22:05)
landeras raid hour you get one free raid (22:03 - 22:07)
on Wednesday night but when they do (22:05 - 22:09)
events when they do weekend events like (22:07 - 22:12)
raid raid weekends they give you five (22:09 - 22:16)
free passes yep they you got if if you (22:12 - 22:19)
checked in you got essentially one pass (22:16 - 22:20)
and then if you were doing things really (22:19 - 22:22)
well and you got your max number the day (22:20 - 22:24)
before you got a second one and then you (22:22 - 22:26)
got a third one for the day so you&#39;re (22:24 - 22:29)
talking about three rather than yep more (22:26 - 22:30)
than five cuz you get your there five (22:29 - 22:32)
additional ones so compared to six like (22:30 - 22:34)
that is a big difference if you checked (22:32 - 22:36)
into an event and got the 800 particles (22:34 - 22:38)
from that you could get all three of (22:36 - 22:40)
these for free assuming you could catch (22:38 - 22:42)
them because that&#39;s the other thing is (22:40 - 22:44)
there were people not managing to catch (22:42 - 22:45)
them doing excellent I think that&#39;s a (22:44 - 22:47)
problem catch them I think these should (22:45 - 22:50)
be a guaranteed catch I this much effort (22:47 - 22:52)
they should be a guaranteed catch (22:50 - 22:54)
especially when Dynamax in the games in (22:52 - 22:56)
this main Series games are guaranteed (22:54 - 22:59)
catches right okay hold on we have we (22:56 - 23:01)
have a million conversations sorry yes (22:59 - 23:02)
yeah (23:01 - 23:05)
yeah but okay so back to the the the the (23:02 - 23:08)
time but I kind of agree with both of (23:05 - 23:10)
you um here I am sitting in the middle (23:08 - 23:14)
right I think I understand why they want (23:10 - 23:15)
them to be the time limited because I (23:14 - 23:17)
you say it&#39;s like it forces people to do (23:15 - 23:19)
it in a specific time it forces you to (23:17 - 23:22)
look for a I didn&#39;t have to go oh which (23:19 - 23:23)
day am I going to do it there was a (23:22 - 23:25)
specific day that was it I was never (23:23 - 23:27)
going to do today so I was always going (23:25 - 23:29)
to do yesterday but then obviously you (23:27 - 23:30)
do end up in that situation where if (23:29 - 23:33)
you&#39;re busy this week weekend tough like (23:30 - 23:35)
I was busy last week last weekend (23:33 - 23:37)
because I was away on a work trip (23:35 - 23:38)
therefore I just didn&#39;t get to do the (23:37 - 23:41)
yam mask research dat it didn&#39;t matter (23:38 - 23:43)
too it didn&#39;t matter because I had (23:41 - 23:44)
plenty I didn&#39;t need them so I wasn&#39;t (23:43 - 23:48)
upset but that and that&#39;s feels on a Le (23:44 - 23:51)
lower down than this yeah and and maybe (23:48 - 23:53)
if they were doing these on weekends (23:51 - 23:55)
only and just kept it being the same (23:53 - 23:57)
gigantamax Pokemon for a full month on (23:55 - 23:59)
weekends only that would kind of be a (23:57 - 24:01)
good middle ground there but I think (23:59 - 24:03)
that having this first event where (24:01 - 24:07)
people go to it and lose and go I don&#39;t (24:03 - 24:09)
have the amount of time I need to build (24:07 - 24:11)
a team for the amount of people I have (24:09 - 24:15)
in my area to win this they&#39;re just out (24:11 - 24:16)
of (24:15 - 24:19)
lock well no because it comes because (24:16 - 24:22)
everything in Pokemon go comes back (24:19 - 24:25)
uh yeah but for this to be the way the (24:22 - 24:26)
future is debuted is really (24:25 - 24:29)
disappointing for a lot of people I okay (24:26 - 24:31)
so my my biggest issue this is going to (24:29 - 24:32)
tie back into the timing because I think (24:31 - 24:34)
that I think I think the timing is a (24:32 - 24:36)
pointed I think I think my biggest issue (24:34 - 24:39)
with this weekend was debuting three (24:36 - 24:42)
different Pokemon because you need I I (24:39 - 24:43)
was like in my head I was like I need a (24:42 - 24:45)
Blastoise and an intellon for Charizard (24:43 - 24:48)
I need a reloom and a Venusaur for (24:45 - 24:52)
Blastoise right so I think for I ended (24:48 - 24:55)
up spending 2 million Stardust this week (24:52 - 24:57)
in powering up Pokemon and that&#39;s fine (24:55 - 25:00)
for me and I will say I was I (24:57 - 25:03)
was underestimating the amount of (25:00 - 25:07)
resources that a player would need uh to (25:03 - 25:09)
power things up I got but I got all my (25:07 - 25:12)
Pokemon up to level 40 uh which is more (25:09 - 25:14)
Stardust uh before that when I was doing (25:12 - 25:15)
failings most of my Pokemon were like (25:14 - 25:20)
level 25 or 30ish um (25:15 - 25:24)
so I think if they were I think what ni (25:20 - 25:27)
could have done better which I&#39;m not (25:24 - 25:28)
going to say like rework the whole thing (25:27 - 25:30)
thing cuz I can go on why I think the (25:28 - 25:32)
current format is really good I think (25:30 - 25:35)
Gengar should have just been the first (25:32 - 25:37)
gigantamax Pokemon if it that been this (25:35 - 25:40)
weekend and next weekend I think I yeah (25:37 - 25:43)
I think if because there possibly there (25:40 - 25:46)
were players that were trying to prepare (25:43 - 25:48)
and then ran out of resources because (25:46 - 25:50)
they&#39;re trying to prepare for three (25:48 - 25:53)
different raids and I really think they (25:50 - 25:55)
should have prepared for just like one (25:53 - 25:57)
yeah it does sound like if you prepared (25:55 - 25:59)
for the Charizard and one with the (25:57 - 26:00)
Charizard you could then take that (25:59 - 26:02)
Charizard in to get the Venusaur and (26:00 - 26:04)
then you could take the Venusaur in to (26:02 - 26:06)
get the Blastoise you realistically if (26:04 - 26:08)
you didn&#39;t have 40 people you need to (26:06 - 26:10)
power up as well but I think when you (26:08 - 26:13)
have 40 people you know if you have five (26:10 - 26:15)
people who have a powered up Pokemon and (26:13 - 26:17)
everyone else has the was it level 20 I (26:15 - 26:19)
think they come out of the the raids at (26:17 - 26:21)
um going into then that&#39;s that&#39;s enough (26:19 - 26:23)
to keep them alive for long enough that (26:21 - 26:25)
you do enough damage yeah cuz like level (26:23 - 26:29)
20 you&#39;re at like, 1500 CP or these like (26:25 - 26:33)
yeah so I I think I think that would (26:29 - 26:35)
have maybe alleviated some issues but I (26:33 - 26:38)
do think having just this weekend only (26:35 - 26:40)
is the raid weekend is you&#39;re pushing as (26:38 - 26:42)
many people possible to prevent the (26:40 - 26:45)
situation of okay only 14 people came (26:42 - 26:48)
out because I think going back to Shadow (26:45 - 26:50)
raids everyone came out for shadow (26:48 - 26:52)
Mewtwo and I think Shadow meww was like (26:50 - 26:55)
a what month long three weeks long and (26:52 - 26:56)
then it felt like every weekend there (26:55 - 26:58)
was a ton of people for shadow Mewtwo (26:56 - 27:00)
cuz it was only on weekends and then (26:58 - 27:02)
Shadow okuno came out and that first (27:00 - 27:05)
weekend felt exactly like Shadow meww (27:02 - 27:07)
everyone was doing Shadow okuno and then (27:05 - 27:10)
every weekend after that no one cared (27:07 - 27:12)
anymore and that&#39;s not exclusive to (27:10 - 27:15)
Articuno not to throw shade at Articuno (27:12 - 27:19)
but like you see this in other games in (27:15 - 27:21)
other especially other MMOs whether (27:19 - 27:23)
that&#39;s Destiny or World of Warcraft or (27:21 - 27:25)
Final Fantasy where people want to do it (27:23 - 27:27)
right away even Pokemon even in scarlet (27:25 - 27:29)
and violet want to do it on the Thursday (27:27 - 27:31)
night they want to do it when it debuts (27:29 - 27:33)
and as you go longer and longer those (27:31 - 27:36)
people already did it those hardcore (27:33 - 27:38)
players already did it and they don&#39;t (27:36 - 27:40)
need to do it anymore so like you&#39;re (27:38 - 27:42)
you&#39;re really separating your community (27:40 - 27:44)
out where like the hardcore players (27:42 - 27:46)
showed up and those are the players that (27:44 - 27:49)
can carry the Casual people and the (27:46 - 27:51)
Casual people show up next weekend (27:49 - 27:53)
there&#39;s no more hardcore people they all (27:51 - 27:55)
they all did it and now you have a bunch (27:53 - 27:56)
of casual people joining raids with (27:55 - 27:58)
gastley and Sables and Charmeleon and (27:56 - 28:00)
they&#39;re like I can&#39;t do it it&#39;s because (27:58 - 28:03)
your hardcore people already did it so I (28:00 - 28:05)
do think there is a validity of like (28:03 - 28:07)
maybe some of the time gating makes (28:05 - 28:10)
sense yeah so like maybe we just do it (28:07 - 28:11)
once a (28:10 - 28:14)
month so we can push as many people as (28:11 - 28:16)
possible in in favor of helping the (28:14 - 28:18)
Casual (28:16 - 28:20)
people obviously Charizard venusa or (28:18 - 28:22)
Blastoise is going to come back I still (28:20 - 28:24)
think that for the amount of time it (28:22 - 28:28)
takes to prepare a team of these Pok√©mon (28:24 - 28:30)
considering how new the feature is I (28:28 - 28:32)
think that they should have had the same (28:30 - 28:34)
event going for two weekends in a row I (28:32 - 28:38)
think that it was disappointing to a lot (28:34 - 28:41)
of people to go oh I lost I don&#39;t have (28:38 - 28:43)
enough time to build a team for this and (28:41 - 28:45)
now it&#39;s gone I think they could have (28:43 - 28:46)
done the same thing by having an (28:45 - 28:49)
intermediate step right because if you (28:46 - 28:52)
had uh another Dynamax raid that (28:49 - 28:54)
realistically needed 10 people to do it (28:52 - 28:56)
you would still have that same thing of (28:54 - 28:59)
people going oh I can&#39;t do this this is (28:56 - 29:01)
not going to work and then they have the (28:59 - 29:03)
more time to get ready for the (29:01 - 29:05)
gigantamax ones it&#39;s it&#39;s as I say it&#39;s (29:03 - 29:07)
like most people could just get away (29:05 - 29:09)
with never meeting like I this was the (29:07 - 29:11)
first time I met up with people to do (29:09 - 29:16)
Max rates because I didn&#39;t need to (29:11 - 29:16)
previous yeah (29:16 - 29:22)
I I I think part of like the the (29:19 - 29:25)
difficulty is just (29:22 - 29:27)
people I don&#39;t want to say like not (29:25 - 29:29)
accepting or not understanding I I think (29:27 - 29:32)
that&#39;s like way too harsh but people (29:29 - 29:35)
accepting that this not accepting that (29:32 - 29:37)
this is just a different system this is (29:35 - 29:40)
just all new like I think the reason I (29:37 - 29:45)
had so much fun in this weekend was (29:40 - 29:47)
because sitting there with people and (29:45 - 29:50)
being like and seeing what they are (29:47 - 29:52)
doing on the top like because you can (29:50 - 29:53)
see what they do you can see when they (29:52 - 29:55)
attack you can see when they cheat they (29:53 - 29:57)
they defend um you can you see your (29:55 - 29:59)
party of four (29:57 - 30:01)
which felt very like uh there was a game (29:59 - 30:05)
called mag which uh was it was like a (30:01 - 30:07)
kind of like a Socom Call of Duty kind (30:05 - 30:09)
of game but it was it was like what it (30:07 - 30:10)
was I think it was like 100 players (30:09 - 30:13)
versus 100 players but it would break it (30:10 - 30:15)
down into like your in a group of six (30:13 - 30:17)
and then you have little groups of six (30:15 - 30:19)
and then in that group of six there was (30:17 - 30:22)
like a commander and then um it was (30:19 - 30:24)
interesting to see it was kind of like (30:22 - 30:26)
that in Pokemon in this in this you have (30:24 - 30:28)
like your little group of four so you&#39;re (30:26 - 30:30)
you you you you&#39;re the four of you are (30:28 - 30:34)
responsible for your fight um and (30:30 - 30:36)
because you&#39;re local you could find (30:34 - 30:38)
those people standing next to you and (30:36 - 30:40)
you don&#39;t necessarily need to find all (30:38 - 30:42)
four so like I ended up being in a raid (30:40 - 30:48)
with Kyle from goast and uh who like we (30:42 - 30:51)
we had like a Charmander and a like a (30:48 - 30:52)
like a sore Bunny and they like died (30:51 - 30:55)
instantly right but because I I because (30:52 - 30:57)
Kyle was there Kyle was like okay I&#39;ll (30:55 - 30:59)
bring my gigantamax Charizard and I&#39;ll (30:57 - 31:01)
Attack I&#39;ll be like perfect I&#39;m bringing (30:59 - 31:03)
my Metagross I&#39;m going to defend and I&#39;m (31:01 - 31:04)
going to heal and even though those two (31:03 - 31:06)
teammates completely got wiped out right (31:04 - 31:08)
away we were able to keep our party (31:06 - 31:12)
alive the entire time no problem yeah um (31:08 - 31:14)
and that is that is just not something (31:12 - 31:16)
that can happen in traditional raids and (31:14 - 31:18)
I&#39;ve said on the show for for eight (31:16 - 31:20)
years or seven years I guess that when (31:18 - 31:23)
when I do a traditional raid I just go (31:20 - 31:26)
in with recommended because I&#39;ve never (31:23 - 31:27)
needed to power up a new Pokemon right (31:26 - 31:30)
like I have I have six Kyogre at max (31:27 - 31:32)
level I got six groudons at max level (31:30 - 31:35)
you haven&#39;t had to for a long time for a (31:32 - 31:37)
long time been out for a long time it&#39;s (31:35 - 31:38)
it&#39;s been out for eight years it&#39;s crazy (31:37 - 31:40)
and I go into the raid and I don&#39;t even (31:38 - 31:43)
look at my screen I have never dodged a (31:40 - 31:46)
l a single time in traditional raids I (31:43 - 31:48)
have just hit the little button and (31:46 - 31:51)
moved on right there&#39;s really even at (31:48 - 31:52)
this point not a lot of reason to give (31:51 - 31:54)
your Pokemon even a second move in raids (31:52 - 31:55)
because as long as you&#39;re hitting a (31:54 - 31:59)
super effective attack you&#39;re fine (31:55 - 32:00)
and so I think that mentality and it&#39;s (31:59 - 32:02)
not a ma bad mentality because you&#39;ve (32:00 - 32:04)
been doing it for seven plus years is (32:02 - 32:06)
like I&#39;m just going to do the same thing (32:04 - 32:07)
I&#39;m just going to go join a raid I&#39;m (32:06 - 32:10)
just going to hit attack and to me being (32:07 - 32:12)
able to coordinate being able to play A (32:10 - 32:14)
Healer being able to play a defense (32:12 - 32:16)
person being able to play an attacker (32:14 - 32:17)
literally just like scarlet and violet (32:16 - 32:19)
it&#39;s kind of funny why I like this it&#39;s (32:17 - 32:22)
just so (32:19 - 32:26)
cool and just thinking of a strategy and (32:22 - 32:28)
like switching out multiple switches out (32:26 - 32:30)
like right before you&#39;re gigantamaxing (32:28 - 32:31)
you&#39;re like or dynamaxing like I&#39;m going (32:30 - 32:33)
to switch to this because this is my (32:31 - 32:37)
actual healer here like I absolutely (32:33 - 32:40)
love it um and people just didn&#39;t (32:37 - 32:43)
realize not enough people realized that (32:40 - 32:45)
not enough people understand it yet and (32:43 - 32:49)
I think that having it just be this one (32:45 - 32:51)
weekend and people not be able to (32:49 - 32:54)
realize it one weekend and then regroup (32:51 - 32:56)
the following weekend to retry the same (32:54 - 32:59)
raids because you want to succeed at (32:56 - 33:01)
something you failed you don&#39;t want to (32:59 - 33:02)
have them go away and have to do a (33:01 - 33:06)
Gengar next weekend I think I think it&#39;s (33:02 - 33:08)
it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting because I I I (33:06 - 33:10)
sincerely thought Pokemon was going to (33:08 - 33:14)
drip feed this or I should say Niantic I (33:10 - 33:16)
think they probably still will it&#39;s just (33:14 - 33:18)
October right right right right but but (33:16 - 33:20)
what I&#39;m saying is D Dynamax made its (33:18 - 33:22)
debut on September (33:20 - 33:23)
15th (33:22 - 33:26)
so you&#39;ve had I feel like Dynamax and (33:23 - 33:29)
gigantamax so essentially go together (33:26 - 33:32)
though that gigantamax is the real (33:29 - 33:36)
feature yes that so in in my mind (33:32 - 33:40)
gigantamax is kind of like the gyms (33:36 - 33:43)
compared to the rest of the Pok√© stops (33:40 - 33:45)
and the normal catching of Pokemon (33:43 - 33:48)
throughout the rest of Pokemon go that (33:45 - 33:50)
Dynamax raids are kind of like the (33:48 - 33:53)
normal Pokemon catching equivalent takes (33:50 - 33:56)
a lot more time yes um takes a lot more (33:53 - 33:58)
time to build a team because there is (33:56 - 34:00)
you have to you can&#39;t just catch Pokemon (33:58 - 34:02)
over and over again because of the max (34:00 - 34:04)
particle thing but yes the Dynamax raids (34:02 - 34:06)
are kind of just the base catching (34:04 - 34:08)
Pokemon build a team and then the gigant (34:06 - 34:10)
max raids are the are the raids are the (34:08 - 34:12)
actual (34:10 - 34:14)
raids yes as this part of see I can see (34:12 - 34:17)
what you&#39;re saying yeah I can yeah I (34:14 - 34:19)
think what what I&#39;m saying is I&#39;m just (34:17 - 34:23)
shocked they did gigantamax so quickly (34:19 - 34:25)
because I don&#39;t think people would take (34:23 - 34:29)
di okay I I say this with so much energy (34:25 - 34:31)
because I feel strongly this way I don&#39;t (34:29 - 34:35)
think people would have taken Dynamax (34:31 - 34:37)
seriously enough without the gigantamax (34:35 - 34:39)
raids and I think that&#39;s why so many (34:37 - 34:41)
people have been failing this weekend (34:39 - 34:43)
and I feel that way because I have not (34:41 - 34:45)
been taking Dynamax seriously because I (34:43 - 34:48)
think that it on its own is boring I (34:45 - 34:50)
think that with the gigantamax raids (34:48 - 34:52)
there is something to work towards that (34:50 - 34:56)
is challenging and exciting and now I (34:52 - 34:58)
want to do all the Dynamax I almost woke (34:56 - 35:01)
up at 5 a.m. to go out and and be ready (34:58 - 35:04)
for the 6 a.m. Dynamax raids yeah yeah (35:01 - 35:06)
but because I want to do the gigantamax (35:04 - 35:10)
rates but without that I don&#39;t (35:06 - 35:13)
care I think they need the gigantamax (35:10 - 35:14)
there I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a question of (35:13 - 35:16)
them not drip feeding it I think it&#39;s a (35:14 - 35:18)
question of them releasing the rest of (35:16 - 35:19)
the (35:18 - 35:21)
feature but what but I guess I think (35:19 - 35:24)
what I&#39;m saying is what I saw some other (35:21 - 35:27)
people say is there wasn&#39;t enough time (35:24 - 35:31)
to prepare which to me is like well (35:27 - 35:33)
you&#39;ve had clearly there was because you (35:31 - 35:35)
did I did nobody knew that it was going (35:33 - 35:39)
to be this hard though I well true I (35:35 - 35:41)
didn&#39;t know either most people didn&#39;t (35:39 - 35:43)
understand how hard this was going to be (35:41 - 35:48)
I didn&#39;t either um but like I&#39;ve done 55 (35:43 - 35:51)
Dynamax raids since the debut and then I (35:48 - 35:55)
did 15 gigantamax raids um so I have a (35:51 - 35:58)
lot of Dynamax Pokemon and I even said A (35:55 - 36:00)
week ago or two weeks ago that like I&#39;ll (35:58 - 36:03)
go out and I&#39;ll do like four raids and (36:00 - 36:04)
it&#39;s great because I don&#39;t have to spend (36:03 - 36:06)
any money whereas like the old (36:04 - 36:07)
traditional system if I wanted to do (36:06 - 36:09)
four one star or three star raids that (36:07 - 36:11)
would be $3 because the first one would (36:09 - 36:13)
be free and then I&#39;d have to pay a (36:11 - 36:16)
dollar for that but I can do four raids (36:13 - 36:19)
in a day for free pretty easy um and I (36:16 - 36:22)
think that&#39;s absolutely fantastic and I (36:19 - 36:24)
I did I powered up an intellion I (36:22 - 36:26)
powered up a reloom I powered up a two (36:24 - 36:28)
Charizards one Venusaur a blast (36:26 - 36:32)
a failinks so I was pretty ready to go (36:28 - 36:37)
um and I think that like I had time to (36:32 - 36:41)
prepare because when I because uh when (36:37 - 36:43)
you get a really (36:41 - 36:46)
good Venusaur for example that&#39;s the one (36:43 - 36:49)
you&#39;re going to invest in both in candy (36:46 - 36:51)
and Stardust and Max particles so like (36:49 - 36:55)
my Venusaur was Max Vine whip level two (36:51 - 36:58)
or whatever it&#39;s called and it was (36:55 - 37:01)
uh uh defense one and then it was like (36:58 - 37:04)
Max Spirit two right because I was like (37:01 - 37:06)
this is a 98% (37:04 - 37:09)
Venusaur I don&#39;t need the 100% this (37:06 - 37:11)
one&#39;s ready to go I&#39;m going to focus on (37:09 - 37:12)
a Squirtle or I&#39;m going to focus on a (37:11 - 37:13)
Charizard so I&#39;m going to power this one (37:12 - 37:16)
up so like my Metagross also Max defense (37:13 - 37:20)
One Max Spirit 2 max meteor SM whatever (37:16 - 37:22)
psychic Zen headbutt whatever that one (37:20 - 37:26)
is like level two so in between raids I (37:22 - 37:29)
was leveling that up and I think we saw (37:26 - 37:32)
a lot of people this week being like Oh (37:29 - 37:33)
you know I&#39;ve been able to do a landeras (37:32 - 37:34)
with 20 people and I brought six (37:33 - 37:36)
Stantler and that&#39;s fine and so they (37:34 - 37:38)
they went into this going like H I&#39;ll (37:36 - 37:41)
just bring my my my six (37:38 - 37:43)
Sables and there&#39;ll be 40 other people (37:41 - 37:45)
there and that&#39;ll be fine and then they (37:43 - 37:48)
learned oh that doesn&#39;t work because (37:45 - 37:52)
again this is a brand new system and so (37:48 - 37:54)
I I think part of me I don&#39;t want to (37:52 - 37:56)
give nitic too much credit is like we (37:54 - 37:58)
need to put this out quicker (37:56 - 38:02)
to literally teach people what to expect (37:58 - 38:05)
because even before this there was no (38:02 - 38:09)
reason to Max guard or Max Spirit ever (38:05 - 38:11)
and my RAID groups or the I shouldn&#39;t (38:09 - 38:14)
say my RAID group the 200 people there (38:11 - 38:18)
once they saw in action max guard and (38:14 - 38:20)
Max Spirit people were like adding it to (38:18 - 38:21)
their Pokemon they were like I&#39;m going (38:20 - 38:23)
to I I&#39;ll just spend the particles which (38:21 - 38:24)
like not not a great you have to buy the (38:23 - 38:26)
particles right you have to buy the (38:24 - 38:27)
particles but like if they would have (38:26 - 38:30)
just they had plenty of time to unlock (38:27 - 38:32)
it and I&#39;m not BL yeah they just didn&#39;t (38:30 - 38:35)
know I&#39;m not blaming them like nobody (38:32 - 38:37)
except for Niantic and that&#39;s why I (38:35 - 38:39)
think that they should be repeating this (38:37 - 38:41)
same event next weekend and I think that (38:39 - 38:43)
that&#39;s a major Miss and I&#39;m really (38:41 - 38:46)
frustrated about but you can get Gengar (38:43 - 38:49)
next weekend and honestly gigantamax (38:46 - 38:51)
Gengar is cooler but still like I said (38:49 - 38:53)
if you fail at something you want to go (38:51 - 38:55)
be able to go back and succeed at it (38:53 - 38:58)
yeah yeah yeah I&#39;m just I&#39;m just I again (38:55 - 38:59)
I&#39;m not trying to defend them but I (38:58 - 39:00)
think (38:59 - 39:02)
like I don&#39;t think this is a bad feature (39:00 - 39:05)
I&#39;m actually really excited about it (39:02 - 39:06)
yeah yeah I just think they had to like (39:05 - 39:09)
show us how to do it because we were not (39:06 - 39:12)
getting that with failinks or or Beldum (39:09 - 39:14)
we just like why would we ever hit Max (39:12 - 39:17)
spirit and literally if you had somebody (39:14 - 39:19)
on your team that had Max gard and Max (39:17 - 39:22)
Spirit your team of four would would (39:19 - 39:28)
would just be fine um a really good sit (39:22 - 39:31)
okay failinks or your team of four as in (39:28 - 39:34)
inside the okay never mind for a second (39:31 - 39:36)
I thought you were saying you could so (39:34 - 39:39)
we had we had we had a group of 20 for (39:36 - 39:42)
Blastoise and every group of four died (39:39 - 39:44)
except one group of four and it was (39:42 - 39:47)
three Venusaur in a Metagross and all (39:44 - 39:49)
the Metagross did was Max guard Max (39:47 - 39:52)
Spirit Max Spirit Max guard Max Spirit (39:49 - 39:54)
Max Spirit and the three Venusaur never (39:52 - 39:56)
died and all they did was attack that (39:54 - 39:58)
group of four took out (39:56 - 40:03)
25% of blastoise&#39;s HP by themselves and (39:58 - 40:07)
they were never and and the one of my my (40:03 - 40:09)
my my partner who was in The Raid like (40:07 - 40:12)
they they didn&#39;t power up anything they (40:09 - 40:14)
were the Casual player that was like I&#39;m (40:12 - 40:15)
just going to use the Venusaur I caught (40:14 - 40:17)
from the pass raid I&#39;m not going to give (40:15 - 40:19)
it anything ex extra and they were F (40:17 - 40:21)
they they survived just fine the level (40:19 - 40:26)
1500 CP Venusaur just it never died (40:21 - 40:31)
so as as these raids go on right like (40:26 - 40:32)
when when Blastoise Venusaur Charizard (40:31 - 40:35)
come back (40:32 - 40:38)
imagine players with level three max (40:35 - 40:41)
spirit level three max guard level three (40:38 - 40:45)
max canonade whatever whatever Blastoise (40:41 - 40:47)
is called like I I think the numbers (40:45 - 40:51)
that Niantic said 10 to 40 is accurate (40:47 - 40:53)
if we can beat it if we can beat blasto (40:51 - 40:56)
with 20 people having only Max guard at (40:53 - 40:59)
level one and Max Spirit at level one (40:56 - 41:01)
what does that look like when our Max (40:59 - 41:02)
spirit&#39;s level three and our Max guard (41:01 - 41:04)
is level (41:02 - 41:07)
three and I again I think that&#39;s why (41:04 - 41:09)
it&#39;s like it&#39;s both a blessing and a (41:07 - 41:13)
curse that this is this was like only (41:09 - 41:15)
this weekend because I think it hurt it (41:13 - 41:17)
hurt so many communities I was seeing so (41:15 - 41:19)
many people just not be able to finish (41:17 - 41:23)
this and being really frustrated and (41:19 - 41:26)
I I think that I think that it could (41:23 - 41:27)
have been redeemed if they had had the (41:26 - 41:31)
same going on next weekend I think that (41:27 - 41:33)
this was also really important to show (41:31 - 41:35)
people that this is how the Future (41:33 - 41:37)
Works I think the other thing you have (41:35 - 41:38)
as well though is the same thing you&#39;re (41:37 - 41:40)
going to get in any situation where (41:38 - 41:44)
there are uh hard battles is that some (41:40 - 41:47)
people just don&#39;t care and they they (41:44 - 41:49)
want they want the thing but no it&#39;s (41:47 - 41:50)
true you see it in scarlet and violet (41:49 - 41:52)
all the time where people will just join (41:50 - 41:53)
with anything and they&#39;re just like I (41:52 - 41:56)
just want the Pokemon I don&#39;t care about (41:53 - 41:59)
the Battle I just want to get the thing (41:56 - 42:00)
um (41:59 - 42:02)
and that&#39;s just a difference of opinion (42:00 - 42:04)
and if you don&#39;t like that you&#39;re never (42:02 - 42:07)
going to like a hard battle and that&#39;s (42:04 - 42:09)
fine but that&#39;s just going to be an (42:07 - 42:12)
issue that that people have I will say (42:09 - 42:14)
however one thing I was thinking of if (42:12 - 42:16)
they&#39;re going to do super hard battles (42:14 - 42:19)
that require a lot of effort I&#39;m (42:16 - 42:20)
actually really glad they chose (42:19 - 42:22)
gigantamax for (42:20 - 42:25)
that because it&#39;s not a Pokemon that you (42:22 - 42:27)
can&#39;t get a different way right if they (42:25 - 42:30)
released a Pokemon that was unique to (42:27 - 42:36)
these which okay do they will sure let&#39;s (42:30 - 42:37)
let&#39;s I&#39;ll complain about that when it (42:36 - 42:40)
happens but let&#39;s forget about the (42:37 - 42:42)
future if they&#39; done this in a yeah (42:40 - 42:43)
these These are Pokemon that you can (42:42 - 42:46)
only get this way and that&#39;s the I think (42:43 - 42:49)
I think I would have (42:46 - 42:49)
been that well that&#39;s different because (42:49 - 42:53)
that&#39;s just the gigantamax form you can (42:51 - 42:54)
get oh yeah okay good point good point (42:53 - 42:55)
good point I&#39;m talking about Pokemon (42:54 - 42:58)
that you can only get in in gigantamax R (42:55 - 43:02)
which will probably only be one (42:58 - 43:05)
um yeah I just I think that if if that (43:02 - 43:07)
was the case it would be a lot more I (43:05 - 43:08)
actually am glad that they did it on (43:07 - 43:10)
something that&#39;s just a form and it&#39;s (43:08 - 43:12)
just a temporary in battle form so if (43:10 - 43:14)
you don&#39;t care about that you can just (43:12 - 43:16)
ignore it and you&#39;re fine and sure (43:14 - 43:17)
there&#39;s going to be a bit of you deep (43:16 - 43:19)
inside going I don&#39;t have FAL election (43:17 - 43:22)
but that&#39;s (43:19 - 43:24)
okay I want to keep I want to keep (43:22 - 43:26)
talking about this but uh I I need to (43:24 - 43:28)
pay the bills so we got got to take a (43:26 - 43:31)
break (43:28 - 43:31)
uh uh and when we come back uh we will (43:31 - 43:35)
we will talk about like the max (43:34 - 43:37)
particles and and the the stuff that we (43:35 - 43:42)
haven&#39;t touched on so we will be right (43:37 - 43:46)
back and we are back from our break uh (43:42 - 43:48)
okay so before (43:46 - 43:52)
the gigantamax came I was I was (43:48 - 43:54)
streaming on Twitch I was doing my (43:52 - 43:58)
Pokemon Crystal thing that&#39;s a whole (43:54 - 44:01)
other story but uh somebody came in and (43:58 - 44:03)
they were like did you see that people (44:01 - 44:05)
are failing with 40 (44:03 - 44:07)
people these seem impossible and then (44:05 - 44:09)
they gave me a little link to like the S (44:07 - 44:11)
it was no it wasn&#39;t even the sulf road (44:09 - 44:14)
it was the r pookemon go subreddit I (44:11 - 44:17)
like oh gosh not this (44:14 - 44:20)
subreddit uh and I read through it and (44:17 - 44:22)
the funniest part was like the the the (44:20 - 44:24)
person who posted it was like yeah I (44:22 - 44:26)
failed and then in in their screenshot (44:24 - 44:28)
they had like they were using a a Gastly (44:26 - 44:30)
against Charizard or something he&#39;s like (44:28 - 44:32)
brother this is why you fail why you (44:30 - 44:34)
bringing a Gastly here at least evolve (44:32 - 44:37)
it like there&#39;s no way you don&#39;t H like (44:34 - 44:38)
there&#39;s no way you just don&#39;t have (44:37 - 44:40)
enough candy to evolve to Gar there&#39;s (44:38 - 44:42)
just not this Pokemon&#39;s been in the game (44:40 - 44:44)
for eight years and it&#39;s featured all (44:42 - 44:46)
this past (44:44 - 44:50)
week just no way but (44:46 - 44:53)
uh but what Al was saying right before (44:50 - 44:55)
we got to the break which was some (44:53 - 44:58)
people just don&#39;t care or they just (44:55 - 44:59)
or they&#39;re just suck in that traditional (44:58 - 45:01)
mindset of like I&#39;ll just bring whatever (44:59 - 45:03)
everyone else will carry me that&#39;s (45:01 - 45:08)
fine and the funniest thing that I think (45:03 - 45:11)
is when you have 40 people each person (45:08 - 45:13)
has three Pokemon so you see a number in (45:11 - 45:15)
the upper corner and it says (45:13 - 45:18)
120 and when you are going against like (45:15 - 45:20)
Venusaur and you see like Venusaur is (45:18 - 45:22)
preparing for an attack Venusaur use (45:20 - 45:24)
solar beam and you see the 120 drop to (45:22 - 45:27)
like 80 Pokemon like instantly and (45:24 - 45:29)
you&#39;re like well that was every single (45:27 - 45:30)
Squirtle that somebody brought to this (45:29 - 45:35)
raid is just obliterated instantly oh (45:30 - 45:38)
gosh but I but yeah I I think there (45:35 - 45:40)
there is definitely like (45:38 - 45:43)
um there&#39;s (45:40 - 45:46)
definitely probably some balance of (45:43 - 45:49)
resources being needed because you are (45:46 - 45:52)
ultimately starting over and I don&#39;t I (45:49 - 45:54)
have no problem with starting over uh (45:52 - 45:56)
because it gives me new things to work (45:54 - 45:57)
towards it gives me a reason to go out (45:56 - 46:00)
to do raids I talked about how when you (45:57 - 46:03)
do a Dynamax raid um I I think I even (46:00 - 46:05)
like posted this on like blue sky or (46:03 - 46:07)
whatever of like six of my Sables were (46:05 - 46:11)
sitting in raid dens because I did six (46:07 - 46:13)
gas s raids and then I left six Sables (46:11 - 46:16)
and then I was getting free Sable candy (46:13 - 46:17)
which I think is a fantastic feature and (46:16 - 46:19)
it cost me no money because I was doing (46:17 - 46:21)
those rates for free and I was leaving (46:19 - 46:24)
the saes a great feature again terrible (46:21 - 46:25)
for remote people because if nobody ever (46:24 - 46:27)
goes to that Den you will get no can C (46:25 - 46:30)
for it yeah yeah yeah so obviously if (46:27 - 46:32)
you&#39;re in Tokyo or you&#39;re in New York or (46:30 - 46:35)
you&#39;re in La you&#39;re going to get more (46:32 - 46:38)
candy versus you know just doing a raid (46:35 - 46:41)
in the middle of nowhere and then no one (46:38 - 46:43)
else also going back to do that raid (46:41 - 46:46)
yeah totally (46:43 - 46:46)
um it it it is expensive to power up a (46:47 - 46:55)
Pokemon uh but evolving a Pokemon is (46:52 - 46:58)
still relatively cheap so like seeing (46:55 - 47:00)
these Charmeleon or these Squirtles or (46:58 - 47:04)
these Bulbasaur and being like okay you (47:00 - 47:06)
don&#39;t no one understood how hard these (47:04 - 47:09)
were going to be but like also did you (47:06 - 47:11)
but but but but we kind of did CU like (47:09 - 47:12)
three bubbl stur really didn&#39;t work (47:11 - 47:14)
against failinks and three charmanders (47:12 - 47:17)
didn&#39;t really work against (47:14 - 47:19)
Beldum but not everybody has invested (47:17 - 47:21)
very much into these raids so maybe they (47:19 - 47:23)
have the charmanders but they&#39;ve never (47:21 - 47:26)
even tried a failen and they (47:23 - 47:28)
just so again I again I think it&#39;s like (47:26 - 47:31)
a blessing and a curse that these (47:28 - 47:35)
raids showed people kind of what they (47:31 - 47:38)
can work towards MH um and to be fair I (47:35 - 47:40)
don&#39;t (47:38 - 47:42)
think people will have enough time for (47:40 - 47:44)
Gengar if they didn&#39;t have enough time (47:42 - 47:45)
for (47:44 - 47:49)
this but maybe the people who because (47:45 - 47:52)
Gengar is this up because yeah you have (47:49 - 47:54)
a week it is soon you have a full week (47:52 - 47:56)
though yeah yeah so I mean like my (47:54 - 47:58)
takeway way I don&#39;t know what your (47:56 - 48:00)
takeway Al is is like I was doing raids (47:58 - 48:02)
well it sounds like you did one of each (48:00 - 48:03)
but I was doing raids to get like a (48:02 - 48:06)
decent Charizard Venusaur Blastoise and (48:03 - 48:09)
then my plan this week is to level those (48:06 - 48:12)
up like I&#39;m going to get Max guard on (48:09 - 48:14)
all of them I&#39;m going to get Max Spirit (48:12 - 48:15)
on all of them I&#39;m going to try to get (48:14 - 48:18)
to level two on all of them and then put (48:15 - 48:20)
candy into (48:18 - 48:23)
them uh and now I&#39;m going to have really (48:20 - 48:25)
solid fire water counters for every (48:23 - 48:28)
single future raid MH (48:25 - 48:31)
yeah I think (48:28 - 48:31)
I one problem I guess is when if you (48:32 - 48:39)
you&#39;re powering up one of your Pokemon (48:37 - 48:40)
and if you&#39;ve not if you&#39;re not (48:39 - 48:42)
constantly catching absolutely (48:40 - 48:45)
everything and you know always using (48:42 - 48:47)
aega and always throwing on (48:45 - 48:50)
that star piece to get you and always (48:47 - 48:53)
using pin up always using pinup yeah (48:50 - 48:54)
exactly if you&#39;re not doing all of those (48:53 - 48:57)
things you do run out of these resources (48:54 - 48:59)
very quickly one of the things I&#39;ve I&#39;ve (48:57 - 49:01)
always disliked about Pok√©mon go as much (48:59 - 49:03)
as I love this game and I play it for (49:01 - 49:07)
literally hours every single day I I (49:03 - 49:09)
don&#39;t like how there are (49:07 - 49:11)
currencies first of all there seems to (49:09 - 49:13)
be so many currencies but also every (49:11 - 49:15)
currency is used for so many different (49:13 - 49:18)
things so like Stardust is used for (49:15 - 49:20)
powering up but also for trades and then (49:18 - 49:24)
it&#39;s cand is used for evolving but also (49:20 - 49:27)
powering up and also adding now the (49:24 - 49:29)
Dynamax (49:27 - 49:33)
moves and the XL candy in particular for (49:29 - 49:37)
level three is a lot of XL candy to (49:33 - 49:40)
power up even one of the moves to level (49:37 - 49:42)
three and you know you can argue you (49:40 - 49:44)
don&#39;t need level three sure (49:42 - 49:45)
fine (49:44 - 49:48)
but if you&#39;re wanting to try and do it (49:45 - 49:49)
with as few people as possible you (49:48 - 49:52)
realistically need to right so I think (49:49 - 49:53)
it&#39;s probably one of those things where (49:52 - 49:55)
the hardcore people will continue going (49:53 - 49:58)
even more hardcore the less hardcore (49:55 - 50:00)
people will just completely drop off it (49:58 - 50:02)
and then the people like me in the (50:00 - 50:04)
middle will be going I just don&#39;t have (50:02 - 50:06)
enough resources to do everything I want (50:04 - 50:09)
to do and that&#39;s frustrating but I&#39;m (50:06 - 50:11)
going to keep doing as much as I can to (50:09 - 50:13)
try and get everything I doubt I&#39;ll have (50:11 - 50:15)
the time to do Gengar this week I know I (50:13 - 50:17)
said this last week about the others but (50:15 - 50:19)
I literally don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have the (50:17 - 50:22)
time this week right because you know I (50:19 - 50:23)
can&#39;t do it after work because I need to (50:22 - 50:24)
get the kids to bed and then by the time (50:23 - 50:26)
I got the kids to bed at 7:00 there&#39;s (50:24 - 50:28)
only two hours until you can&#39;t do the (50:26 - 50:31)
battles anymore so it would take me at (50:28 - 50:34)
least half an hour if not longer to get (50:31 - 50:35)
into Edinburgh there&#39;s not enough time (50:34 - 50:37)
and then on Saturday it&#39;s my kid&#39;s (50:35 - 50:38)
birthday party so it&#39;s just this week&#39;s (50:37 - 50:43)
not going to work so I think for people (50:38 - 50:46)
who are have the time and have the the (50:43 - 50:49)
currencies in the game it&#39;s it I can see (50:46 - 50:52)
why it&#39;s great but I think it&#39;s going to (50:49 - 50:54)
continue to be just as frustrating for (50:52 - 50:57)
the the less hardcore people but I guess (50:54 - 50:58)
I mean I think I think with like (50:57 - 51:00)
Charizard Venusaur Blastoise at least (50:58 - 51:01)
because those Pokemon have been in the (51:00 - 51:03)
game because those Pokemon have had (51:01 - 51:05)
multiple Community Days right I think (51:03 - 51:06)
Bulbasaur is the only one that hasn&#39;t (51:05 - 51:09)
had two Squirtle has had certain (51:06 - 51:11)
Bulbasaur has had two think it has had (51:09 - 51:13)
two yeah I think I think all the CLE (51:11 - 51:16)
Stars I&#39;ve had two um G said had a (51:13 - 51:18)
community day I get that but somehow I (51:16 - 51:21)
have no candy left for any of them and I (51:18 - 51:23)
don&#39;t know what I did I don&#39;t know how (51:21 - 51:24)
like I&#39;ve been playing this game for (51:23 - 51:25)
eight (51:24 - 51:28)
years I don&#39;t know just it disappears (51:25 - 51:31)
yeah I mean I think it doesn&#39;t disappear (51:28 - 51:34)
there there&#39;s like you know you know I I (51:31 - 51:37)
had three million Stardust going into (51:34 - 51:41)
New York go Fest and I left New York go (51:37 - 51:45)
fest with 3 million Stardust but I spent (51:41 - 51:48)
two million Stardust during that time (51:45 - 51:52)
running palia nonstop I ran palia every (51:48 - 51:56)
second I was playing um and that&#39;s 5,000 (51:52 - 51:57)
Stardust every 10 minutes (51:56 - 52:02)
and but I was earning Stardust back by (51:57 - 52:03)
running star piece and then catching (52:02 - 52:05)
Pokemon so it was like this (52:03 - 52:09)
cycle and I I really wanted like like I (52:05 - 52:12)
spent two million Stardust this week to (52:09 - 52:15)
power up reloom Charizard Venusaur (52:12 - 52:18)
intellian Blastoise and there&#39;s part of (52:15 - 52:19)
me that&#39;s (52:18 - 52:22)
like now I only have 1.5 million (52:19 - 52:25)
Stardust that like I I burned through 2 (52:22 - 52:28)
million but now I have solid (52:25 - 52:32)
counters for Dynamax and gigantamax and (52:28 - 52:36)
that just started and there&#39;s a lot of (52:32 - 52:39)
gigantamax and Dynamax Pokemon uh and so (52:36 - 52:41)
I don&#39;t completely (52:39 - 52:44)
feel (52:41 - 52:47)
like that was a waste because the only (52:44 - 52:49)
thing I was really using Stardust on was (52:47 - 52:53)
like I I traded a kid a Char Cadet in in (52:49 - 52:57)
Korea I one I didn&#39;t understand anything (52:53 - 52:59)
said cuz he was speaking Korean but we (52:57 - 53:01)
we we came to the conclusion that this (52:59 - 53:03)
little kid just wanted Char Cadet I was (53:01 - 53:06)
like I got you man and I don&#39;t how (53:03 - 53:07)
expensive was that trade it was like (53:06 - 53:09)
200,000 or something because he he (53:07 - 53:11)
traded me something that I I didn&#39;t have (53:09 - 53:15)
either um it was like a it was like (53:11 - 53:18)
a like a gen like a seism toad or (53:15 - 53:19)
something because I just never evolved a (53:18 - 53:22)
Time pole into a seis to it was just so (53:19 - 53:24)
whatever like I I can think of so many (53:22 - 53:26)
half a million trades I did in other (53:24 - 53:27)
countries just because that person (53:26 - 53:29)
didn&#39;t have that Shiny Pokemon and I was (53:27 - 53:31)
like I don&#39;t care I what what am I going (53:29 - 53:33)
to use the Stardust for which is true (53:31 - 53:34)
what was I going to use that Stardust (53:33 - 53:36)
for nothing here&#39;s a here&#39;s a here&#39;s a (53:34 - 53:38)
shiny lattos you need one I don&#39;t need (53:36 - 53:40)
one I got like seven of them and now (53:38 - 53:42)
it&#39;s like to me it&#39;s like I have a (53:40 - 53:44)
reason to use Stardust because I didn&#39;t (53:42 - 53:46)
have to use it to power up something to (53:44 - 53:47)
take out a festar (53:46 - 53:50)
landeras some people still like to use (53:47 - 53:51)
St some people like to power up their (53:50 - 53:53)
Pokemon just in general some people like (53:51 - 53:56)
to do the PVP a lot of people run on low (53:53 - 53:57)
Stardust (53:56 - 54:00)
um yeah yeah yeah I think that the the (53:57 - 54:02)
currency I have more of an issue with is (54:00 - 54:04)
the max (54:02 - 54:08)
particles because not only were people (54:04 - 54:10)
running out in order to just do a single (54:08 - 54:12)
one of each of these gigantamax rates (54:10 - 54:15)
this weekend but also if you came in and (54:12 - 54:18)
your team wasn&#39;t fully ready and you had (54:15 - 54:21)
to use the max particles to power up the (54:18 - 54:25)
moves and get all of your team set on (54:21 - 54:28)
that side of things and get your Dynamax (54:25 - 54:30)
Pokemon set to have a team that you (54:28 - 54:33)
could use for these gigantamax raids you (54:30 - 54:35)
have to use max particles for that as (54:33 - 54:37)
well so if you came in and you realize (54:35 - 54:39)
oh I&#39;m not ready I need to power up my (54:37 - 54:42)
Pokemon I need my Pokemon to be (54:39 - 54:44)
stronger but I&#39;m using the exact same (54:42 - 54:45)
currency to power up my Pokemon that I (54:44 - 54:49)
need to literally join these (54:45 - 54:52)
raids I think that&#39;s a problem I (54:49 - 54:53)
understand there are a lot of currencies (54:52 - 54:57)
I think maybe we need one more I I think (54:53 - 55:00)
evolving your Sable to an intellion is (54:57 - 55:04)
easier than giving intellion yes Max (55:00 - 55:06)
guard yes and so that would be like the (55:04 - 55:08)
first step I would tell all these people (55:06 - 55:10)
is like no you don&#39;t have to spend Max (55:08 - 55:12)
particles Max spirit is not going to be (55:10 - 55:14)
helpful on your Charmander it will be (55:12 - 55:16)
helpful on your Charizard but you need (55:14 - 55:18)
to get to the Charizard (55:16 - 55:21)
first (55:18 - 55:21)
um but it&#39;s still a (55:22 - 55:28)
problem yes (55:24 - 55:30)
I think hopefully all the people who (55:28 - 55:32)
brought Sables and gastley and (55:30 - 55:35)
charmanders hopefully they know that (55:32 - 55:37)
going into gas Gengar or whatever else (55:35 - 55:40)
is coming that they should evolve yeah (55:37 - 55:44)
and now that they caught a (55:40 - 55:44)
gigantamax Blastoise Venusaur Charizard (55:44 - 55:51)
because EV as as far as I know no one in (55:47 - 55:54)
our group of 200 failed multiple times (55:51 - 55:56)
right there was like an instance where (55:54 - 55:58)
our group failed once (55:56 - 56:02)
and we were luckily enough everyone was (55:58 - 56:04)
positive and been like we were so close (56:02 - 56:05)
we can do it again everyone just make (56:04 - 56:07)
Minor Adjustments because like I think (56:05 - 56:09)
it was against like Blastoise or (56:07 - 56:10)
something we just didn&#39;t know it had Ice (56:09 - 56:13)
Beam so like people who brought a lot of (56:10 - 56:14)
grass they were like oh just put like (56:13 - 56:16)
one Metagross or at least something that (56:14 - 56:18)
resisted it in and that that really (56:16 - 56:19)
helped out we were able to do it the (56:18 - 56:21)
second time just with plenty of time (56:19 - 56:22)
left the second time it was just a minor (56:21 - 56:23)
adjustment which is great because that&#39;s (56:22 - 56:25)
what you see in seven star raids is like (56:23 - 56:28)
oh we almost had seti let me let me just (56:25 - 56:30)
make one adjustment here and okay cool (56:28 - 56:33)
we got it that&#39;s great um but now (56:30 - 56:36)
ideally hopefully people can spend this (56:33 - 56:40)
week instead of spinning stops or (56:36 - 56:42)
instead of catching more gas leaves (56:40 - 56:43)
maybe they want to catch gas Le I don&#39;t (56:42 - 56:46)
know uh but they can use their 800 (56:43 - 56:49)
particles to then level up the move (56:46 - 56:52)
instead of doing Gastly rids yeah but it (56:49 - 56:53)
it (56:52 - 56:56)
takes again the issue of it takes more (56:53 - 56:58)
preparation people can do on the very (56:56 - 57:00)
first weekend and people were not (56:58 - 57:02)
prepared because of that I think if we (57:00 - 57:04)
if we go back to the the point of like (57:02 - 57:07)
raid weekends give you more raid passes (57:04 - 57:09)
I feel like if they&#39;d done that it would (57:07 - 57:11)
have M like if if they&#39;d gone right the (57:09 - 57:14)
cap is 3,000 today I feel like that (57:11 - 57:15)
could have gone a long way to helping (57:14 - 57:18)
because then you would have had enough (57:15 - 57:23)
to do the three and also power up um and (57:18 - 57:24)
the other thing I&#39;ve been thinking of (57:23 - 57:26)
that would massively have helped this is (57:24 - 57:29)
if the starters that are in Dynamax (57:26 - 57:31)
raids were also spawning in the wild so (57:29 - 57:34)
you could actually get more candy that (57:31 - 57:36)
way like cuz I think I do think that (57:34 - 57:39)
that is a problem for for some people is (57:36 - 57:41)
the lack of candy and yeah sure you get (57:39 - 57:43)
candy when you do the Dynamax raids and (57:41 - 57:44)
yes you can get up to five candy if you (57:43 - 57:48)
put a Pokemon in the Dynamax in the uh (57:44 - 57:50)
the raid spot afterwards but I think (57:48 - 57:52)
just even H even just having them (57:50 - 57:53)
spawning in the wild you could you can (57:52 - 57:56)
rack up that candy really quickly you (57:53 - 57:59)
are you are on a fine line Al here (57:56 - 58:02)
asking for Kanto Pokemon to spawn in the (57:59 - 58:04)
wild in this video game well we have the (58:02 - 58:07)
Gastly Dynamax raids and we have the (58:04 - 58:09)
Gastly for the Halloween so some of that (58:07 - 58:14)
was present but yes yeah (58:09 - 58:17)
I I totally understand a million percent (58:14 - 58:19)
I understand (58:17 - 58:22)
like using MP to do raids and using MP (58:19 - 58:25)
to power up and how like on a day where (58:22 - 58:26)
you want to do both that that&#39;s (58:25 - 58:29)
incredibly hard unless you want to spend (58:26 - 58:31)
money uh and this was the first time (58:29 - 58:33)
since the system came out I spent money (58:31 - 58:35)
right but in my head I wasn&#39;t spending (58:33 - 58:36)
money (58:35 - 58:40)
to get a rare resource I was spending (58:36 - 58:42)
money as I would a raid (58:40 - 58:45)
pass because and this is why I like the (58:42 - 58:48)
system so much is the a current (58:45 - 58:50)
traditional raid pass is a (58:48 - 58:54)
dollar and that goes both ways (58:50 - 58:59)
though and I I and a remote raid pass is (58:54 - 59:02)
$2 so it&#39;s like would I spend $2 to do a (58:59 - 59:05)
landeras yes because it&#39;s a legendary (59:02 - 59:07)
Pokemon has a higher chance of being (59:05 - 59:09)
shiny I&#39;m going to get Stardust I&#39;m (59:07 - 59:11)
going to get experience I&#39;m G to get (59:09 - 59:14)
rare candy that&#39;s worth it to $2 am i g (59:11 - 59:19)
to spend $2 to do a wulu no why why why (59:14 - 59:21)
would wulu be the same cost as a as a (59:19 - 59:23)
landeras I&#39;m going to get significantly (59:21 - 59:26)
less Stardust significantly less XP it&#39;s (59:23 - 59:28)
wulu does not have a one in 20 shiny (59:26 - 59:30)
chance also I can just go for a walk and (59:28 - 59:33)
I can catch 10 wulu outside like the the (59:30 - 59:36)
traditional raid the traditional (59:33 - 59:41)
raid cost of Entry has always been (59:36 - 59:45)
unbalanced and not and didn&#39;t make sense (59:41 - 59:50)
so the fact that 800 MP is ultimately a (59:45 - 59:54)
dollar and 250 MP which is the cost of a (59:50 - 59:58)
squirtle Gastly whatever is (59:54 - 60:00)
30 cents or (59:58 - 60:03)
something like it&#39;s just fundamentally a (60:00 - 60:07)
better system especially with the cap on (60:03 - 60:10)
your MP 800 is still a lot it&#39;s a big (60:07 - 60:14)
chunk of that and you can&#39;t save it I (60:10 - 60:15)
think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s the thing (60:14 - 60:17)
it&#39;s it&#39;s (60:15 - 60:22)
it&#39;s to me it&#39;s I agree with you 100% (60:17 - 60:24)
Steve that that is better than the raid (60:22 - 60:26)
passes absolutely it is definitely (60:24 - 60:27)
better (60:26 - 60:30)
it makes more sense the problem I have (60:27 - 60:33)
is the fact that then as Hannah said (60:30 - 60:35)
that is the same thing you need to (60:33 - 60:41)
improve the Pokemon in some ways and (60:35 - 60:43)
yes but there but there are some people (60:41 - 60:45)
myself included who don&#39;t use their free (60:43 - 60:49)
Daily raid pass like I I maybe use my (60:45 - 60:51)
free daily raid pass like twice a week (60:49 - 60:53)
so that&#39;s five days of the week I&#39;m not (60:51 - 60:57)
using my free dollar raid pass (60:53 - 60:59)
um and I and I couldn&#39;t use my free (60:57 - 61:01)
daily raid pass on a landeras if I (60:59 - 61:02)
wanted to it&#39;s like oh there&#39;s a land I (61:01 - 61:03)
don&#39;t know I&#39;m using landeras as an (61:02 - 61:05)
example oh there&#39;s a landeras down the (61:03 - 61:08)
street let me go use my free raid pass I (61:05 - 61:09)
can&#39;t do that I mean I guess I could (61:08 - 61:14)
sucker people into spending $2 so I can (61:09 - 61:16)
get landeras for (61:14 - 61:19)
free that&#39;s a possibility but like the (61:16 - 61:24)
days I&#39;m not using my mp to do Gastly or (61:19 - 61:26)
failinks or whatever I can then at least (61:24 - 61:30)
least use it so I I do think (61:26 - 61:33)
there&#39;s like like once once I once I (61:30 - 61:35)
power up my gigantamax (61:33 - 61:38)
Blastoise like I&#39;m done now I&#39;m done I (61:35 - 61:39)
can go back to doing raids or I can (61:38 - 61:41)
focus on something else and I think this (61:39 - 61:43)
is the this is the both the frustrating (61:41 - 61:45)
part but also exciting part of the (61:43 - 61:48)
system is like as this system goes on in (61:45 - 61:50)
like a year people are going to be like (61:48 - 61:53)
oh did gigantamax Blastoise with 10 (61:50 - 61:56)
people because we all we&#39;ve had so so (61:53 - 62:00)
much time to prepare so much time to to (61:56 - 62:03)
I I think the other the other thing that (62:00 - 62:05)
is annoying to me is that I think if it (62:03 - 62:08)
was just max particles you were using to (62:05 - 62:11)
increase the the Dynamax levels as well (62:08 - 62:13)
would&#39; probably feel better is the fact (62:11 - 62:16)
that to actually if you want to (62:13 - 62:19)
get a move to level three you have to (62:16 - 62:21)
use max particles (62:19 - 62:26)
candy XL candy and stardust I think four (62:21 - 62:28)
Stardust no Stardust no no stard (62:26 - 62:30)
Stardust is only the yeah so it&#39;s just (62:28 - 62:31)
the three things but yeah so you&#39;re (62:30 - 62:33)
having to decide do I want to power up (62:31 - 62:35)
this Pokemon or do I want to give it a (62:33 - 62:38)
Dynamax move or improve the Dynamax move (62:35 - 62:40)
and you need both of them for your (62:38 - 62:44)
counter to be any good if it was one or (62:40 - 62:46)
the other it would feel less like you&#39;re (62:44 - 62:49)
trying to B and it&#39;s like which one is (62:46 - 62:50)
actually worth more and especially for (62:49 - 62:51)
this weekend it was like we were all (62:50 - 62:54)
trying to figure that out in real time (62:51 - 62:56)
and if you had prepared but you&#39;d (62:54 - 62:59)
prepared the wrong way you&#39;ve now used (62:56 - 63:03)
up all your candy and you&#39;ve you&#39;re (62:59 - 63:06)
useless yeah so you would you would need (63:03 - 63:10)
uh it it would take three days to (63:06 - 63:13)
do what two it would take eight days to (63:10 - 63:15)
do everything if if you want if we&#39;re (63:13 - 63:18)
just going off the free MP model um for (63:15 - 63:23)
one Pokemon for one Pokemon uh and then (63:18 - 63:27)
XL cost I&#39;m just looking at Venusaur (63:23 - 63:31)
12 XL that&#39;s a lot of XL candy it is a (63:27 - 63:33)
lot of XL candy and C is still really (63:31 - 63:36)
hard to get and I think I think even (63:33 - 63:38)
going to level two which is no XL candy (63:36 - 63:42)
at all um I I I think level two is just (63:38 - 63:46)
so D so good in general especially like (63:42 - 63:49)
Max Spirit or Max guard I don&#39;t know how (63:46 - 63:51)
Max guard actually works so like when (63:49 - 63:53)
you use it a little Shield goes up next (63:51 - 63:55)
to your your name and it does only Max (63:53 - 63:57)
guard you where Max Spirit heals your (63:55 - 64:00)
three teammates and again what&#39;s super (63:57 - 64:02)
cool about these raids and why I love (64:00 - 64:03)
them compared to traditional raids is I (64:02 - 64:05)
can see how much health my teammates (64:03 - 64:08)
have and so I I know whether I need to (64:05 - 64:11)
Max Spirit or not I can also see if they (64:08 - 64:14)
Max guard or they Max spirit I can see (64:11 - 64:16)
that too um I can see when they&#39;re (64:14 - 64:20)
attacking but I I&#39;m not 100% if (64:16 - 64:21)
somebody&#39;s watching on YouTube or in (64:20 - 64:22)
slack or in Discord if they want to (64:21 - 64:24)
leave a comment it seems like when you (64:22 - 64:27)
max guard you are are forcing The Raid (64:24 - 64:30)
boss to attack you yes I read that this (64:27 - 64:32)
morning yes okay because when the metag (64:30 - 64:34)
in that situation where I was like my (64:32 - 64:36)
partner was Venusaur just caught it (64:34 - 64:39)
didn&#39;t power anything up was was the (64:36 - 64:41)
most unprepared possible for this raid (64:39 - 64:43)
weekend they were like they literally (64:41 - 64:46)
had like a a (64:43 - 64:48)
Venusaur a dubwool and a failinks those (64:46 - 64:51)
were the only three Pokemon that (64:48 - 64:53)
hadol yeah that&#39;s more prepared than I (64:51 - 64:55)
would have been I have a d and I have a (64:53 - 64:57)
w (64:55 - 64:59)
the dub wo was evolved that&#39;s true um (64:57 - 65:01)
but that&#39;s what they had they didn&#39;t (64:59 - 65:02)
power up any moves they didn&#39;t power (65:01 - 65:04)
them up anymore they just those were the (65:02 - 65:05)
three Pokemon they had for the entire (65:04 - 65:08)
weekend and I was watching them because (65:05 - 65:09)
I got knocked out I was watching them (65:08 - 65:11)
and I was like this was literally the (65:09 - 65:14)
Venusaur you caught 10 minutes ago and (65:11 - 65:16)
you&#39;re not taking any damage when you (65:14 - 65:18)
are taking damage you&#39;re getting healed (65:16 - 65:21)
in between it was and it was just (65:18 - 65:24)
because one Metagross player was they (65:21 - 65:26)
had Max spirit level two and they Max (65:24 - 65:28)
guarding Max spiring them back to full (65:26 - 65:29)
health and it was (65:28 - 65:33)
like like you can just see in real time (65:29 - 65:36)
how cool this system is but of course (65:33 - 65:38)
like that was the first time we were (65:36 - 65:40)
able to see it because like no we didn&#39;t (65:38 - 65:44)
see that during failings yep yeah you (65:40 - 65:45)
weren&#39;t getting four people together for (65:44 - 65:47)
failinks (65:45 - 65:47)
no even though and I think this is where (65:48 - 65:54)
calling both the the the Dynamax raid (65:51 - 65:56)
battles raid battles and the the gigant (65:54 - 65:58)
max one&#39;s raid battles calling them the (65:56 - 66:00)
same thing makes them seem more similar (65:58 - 66:03)
than they are I really think they&#39;re (66:00 - 66:05)
they&#39;re more separate (66:03 - 66:07)
interesting yeah (66:05 - 66:10)
so even if they repeated the Kanto stuff (66:07 - 66:13)
this weekend which I&#39;m sure people could (66:10 - 66:15)
not play this weekend I totally get it (66:13 - 66:17)
uh I I just don&#39;t think there a week is (66:15 - 66:20)
enough time um to (66:17 - 66:24)
prepare but like I think now now that (66:20 - 66:26)
people have caught some people have (66:24 - 66:28)
caught the gigantamax they can at least (66:26 - 66:31)
start that journey of powering up their (66:28 - 66:34)
po because like for me there&#39;s no reason (66:31 - 66:36)
for me to do Gastly this week I I did (66:34 - 66:38)
probably 10 Gastly in total I got one (66:36 - 66:41)
that&#39;s like a 96% that&#39;ll be my Gengar (66:38 - 66:43)
I&#39;ll catch a gigantamax Gengar this (66:41 - 66:45)
weekend I don&#39;t need to do any more (66:43 - 66:46)
Venusaur I don&#39;t need to do any more (66:45 - 66:48)
charm randers like I need to do them I (66:46 - 66:52)
guess if I wanted more candy for them (66:48 - 66:54)
but like it feels like the system is now (66:52 - 66:57)
designed where you can chase a Pokemon (66:54 - 66:59)
ultimately for free like let&#39;s just say (66:57 - 67:02)
driller drb&#39;s coming out right um like (66:59 - 67:04)
when driller comes out driller will be (67:02 - 67:07)
good against toxcity so I&#39;m going to do (67:04 - 67:09)
a bunch of drill bur once I find a good (67:07 - 67:10)
one I can stop doing drill bur (67:09 - 67:12)
completely and now I can use that MP to (67:10 - 67:16)
power up that drill bur catch the (67:12 - 67:18)
toxcity no need to do any more raids use (67:16 - 67:21)
that toxcity to power up that toxcity (67:18 - 67:23)
this is you could argue like well what (67:21 - 67:25)
is this ultimately for it&#39;s like I don&#39;t (67:23 - 67:26)
I don&#39;t know why have you been playing (67:25 - 67:28)
this game for eight years what like it&#39;s (67:26 - 67:31)
it&#39;s just a giant Loop over it is and it (67:28 - 67:34)
ultimately it&#39;s for the reason at this (67:31 - 67:35)
point in time is just to catch the (67:34 - 67:37)
gigantamax Pokemon that&#39;s the ultimate (67:35 - 67:39)
goal I do think that possibly we could (67:37 - 67:42)
use better rewards in the gigant max (67:39 - 67:44)
raids in particular the rewards from the (67:42 - 67:47)
gigant max raids are crazy good okay (67:44 - 67:49)
they&#39;re so good you get like are you (67:47 - 67:52)
sure I am looking at Al&#39;s face here you (67:49 - 67:56)
you get they&#39;re so good you get like two (67:52 - 67:59)
okay if you if you if you had a lucky (67:56 - 68:02)
egg going you get 100,000 XP for (67:59 - 68:06)
completing that raid 100,000 x it was (68:02 - 68:08)
25,000 base so if you had a lucky egg it (68:06 - 68:09)
would be (68:08 - 68:11)
50,000 oh yeah you&#39;re right you&#39;re right (68:09 - 68:13)
the the XP is good I think the XP is (68:11 - 68:15)
good and the candy was good cuz you got (68:13 - 68:17)
like 30 candy or something but (68:15 - 68:20)
everything else felt a little bit drab (68:17 - 68:22)
it&#39;s like you&#39;d get one XL candy and (68:20 - 68:25)
then you&#39;d get like eight balls to use (68:22 - 68:28)
and maybe you&#39;d get a golden Raz or (68:25 - 68:30)
something like there&#39;s a level of it (68:28 - 68:33)
that&#39;s like it feels like it&#39;s to me it (68:30 - 68:35)
feels like it&#39;s almost kind of good like (68:33 - 68:36)
I&#39;m not going to click that button that (68:35 - 68:39)
says bye right did I did I did I did (68:36 - 68:42)
twice I need I needed to know that&#39;s (68:39 - 68:44)
where I got the 100,000 was there (68:42 - 68:46)
confirm there&#39;s a confirm there&#39;s a (68:44 - 68:49)
confirm you go through it tells you (68:46 - 68:50)
everything so it actually it it doubles (68:49 - 68:54)
your XP so I I would never hit that (68:50 - 68:56)
button if you were not running lucky egg (68:54 - 68:59)
mhm cuz it&#39;s doubling you&#39;re doubling so (68:56 - 69:01)
it&#39;s going from 25 to 50 and then when (68:59 - 69:03)
you hit the button it&#39;s going from 50 to (69:01 - 69:06)
100 uh which is just insane uh it&#39;s (69:03 - 69:09)
doubling your pokeballs so uh I was (69:06 - 69:11)
getting 10 pokeballs every raid it (69:09 - 69:13)
doubles it to 20 but you have to decide (69:11 - 69:15)
the the fun thing about that is you have (69:13 - 69:17)
to decide before or not before you start (69:15 - 69:18)
catching whether you want the extra (69:17 - 69:20)
balls or not yeah yeah yeah and it feels (69:18 - 69:22)
a little bit like maybe you could have (69:20 - 69:24)
given an option to decide after you use (69:22 - 69:27)
your last ball I still think that these (69:24 - 69:28)
should be guaranteed catches that&#39;s my (69:27 - 69:30)
other thing I think that maybe the (69:28 - 69:32)
rewards could be a little bit better (69:30 - 69:34)
that&#39;s dependent on how easy these (69:32 - 69:36)
become over time I think that maybe (69:34 - 69:37)
they&#39;re okay with with where they&#39;re at (69:36 - 69:40)
based on how as people get better they (69:37 - 69:42)
will get to be a little bit more mundane (69:40 - 69:43)
but I really think these should be (69:42 - 69:46)
guaranteed catch all of them not just (69:43 - 69:49)
the shinies yeah I mean like they&#39;re all (69:46 - 69:51)
maybe because they&#39;re so big they&#39;re (69:49 - 69:54)
really easy to get Excellence on yeah (69:51 - 69:56)
but well (69:54 - 69:58)
I I knew multiple people who who hit (69:56 - 70:00)
excellent throws every time and still (69:58 - 70:02)
didn&#39;t manage to catch them and that (70:00 - 70:04)
just feels not great when you put in all (70:02 - 70:07)
the effort and like 38 people managed to (70:04 - 70:10)
catch it so if you have like if you&#39;re (70:07 - 70:12)
going on to the ne if you&#39;re going on to (70:10 - 70:13)
the next raid and people are one and (70:12 - 70:16)
done you don&#39;t have your team anymore (70:13 - 70:18)
like that just feels not great (70:16 - 70:19)
especially considering how it is in the (70:18 - 70:22)
main Series games we can just we can (70:19 - 70:23)
just carry that (70:22 - 70:27)
over although oh did just remember I (70:23 - 70:28)
actually don&#39;t think it&#39;s not in certain (70:27 - 70:31)
Shield okay it&#39;s it Terror raid battles (70:28 - 70:34)
are guaranteed catches but I don&#39;t think (70:31 - 70:39)
I don&#39;t think L yeah there I just just (70:34 - 70:40)
before someone comments it on YouTube (70:39 - 70:42)
because I yeah I did say that earlier as (70:40 - 70:43)
well but I think I was wrong on that (70:42 - 70:46)
fair but still I think these should be I (70:43 - 70:48)
think the was it the Dynamax Adventures (70:46 - 70:50)
were guaranteed (70:48 - 70:52)
catches they were guaranted dyx (70:50 - 70:54)
Adventures were guaranteed catches but (70:52 - 70:56)
just Dynamax and gigantamax rates were (70:54 - 70:59)
not guaranteed (70:56 - 70:59)
catches uh so I 25,000 XP Al right uh (71:00 - 71:07)
that explains if you were pay if you (71:06 - 71:10)
were buying the 200 coins they&#39;re saying (71:07 - 71:12)
consumable items like golden Raz and XEL (71:10 - 71:13)
candy I wish I wish this was more (71:12 - 71:15)
detailed I thought I took a screenshot (71:13 - 71:16)
of the rewards because I wanted to talk (71:15 - 71:20)
about how I did I spent the 200 coins (71:16 - 71:25)
twice um so $4 to like test this but yes (71:20 - 71:27)
it does it does ask if you want to (71:25 - 71:29)
confirm um I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it (71:27 - 71:30)
if you&#39;re not running a lucky egg I (71:29 - 71:32)
don&#39;t know if completing these raids (71:30 - 71:34)
give you (71:32 - 71:36)
Stardust because there was no Stardust (71:34 - 71:38)
on the screen and I was running a star (71:36 - 71:40)
piece that weekend I think I think you (71:38 - 71:42)
might get Stardust just for the catch (71:40 - 71:44)
itself because the catch is just treated (71:42 - 71:48)
like a normal catch in terms of (71:44 - 71:51)
rewards uh it should give you Stardust (71:48 - 71:52)
though like I feel like you should get a (71:51 - 71:55)
bunch of Stardust for doing this (71:52 - 71:57)
but I didn&#39;t think they were I&#39;m trying (71:55 - 72:00)
to look if somebody has a list of (71:57 - 72:03)
rewards (72:00 - 72:06)
um yeah I don&#39;t know I I if if you&#39;re (72:03 - 72:09)
not willing to spend the 80 cents on the (72:06 - 72:11)
lucky egg I don&#39;t know why you would (72:09 - 72:14)
spend $2 to double (72:11 - 72:16)
it (72:14 - 72:18)
like that would be the only reason I (72:16 - 72:20)
would double it is if you were just you (72:18 - 72:23)
want the XP and you get doubles your XL (72:20 - 72:25)
candy so you go from one XL candy to 2 (72:23 - 72:27)
XL but maybe it should be a little bit (72:25 - 72:29)
higher think I don&#39;t think the rewards (72:27 - 72:30)
are that good that&#39;s the one that felt (72:29 - 72:33)
particularly bad it was one XL candy and (72:30 - 72:35)
you&#39;re like that feels not great I (72:33 - 72:37)
changed my mind the rewards are bad I&#39;m (72:35 - 72:39)
not I&#39;m not asking for 40 XL candy but (72:37 - 72:41)
like (72:39 - 72:44)
five you know like it just or even three (72:41 - 72:47)
I don&#39;t know more than one yeah you you (72:44 - 72:49)
were getting you were getting like 30 to (72:47 - 72:53)
40 candy of that Pokemon so when you (72:49 - 72:56)
doubled it it was almost 100 (72:53 - 72:59)
I think I think they changed the rewards (72:56 - 73:02)
after because I remember seeing I&#39;m (72:59 - 73:04)
seeing this screenshot again that I saw (73:02 - 73:06)
on the self Road from very like (73:04 - 73:09)
Australia and they had one rare candy (73:06 - 73:12)
One Max revive two golden Ras and then (73:09 - 73:17)
the 10 balls and the 25 uh remember (73:12 - 73:20)
uh that was not as good as what we were (73:17 - 73:22)
getting later on I think that I think (73:20 - 73:25)
they changed it I don&#39;t ever remember (73:22 - 73:28)
getting golden razes from completing (73:25 - 73:31)
it screen (73:28 - 73:33)
annoyingly it&#39;s too long ago went sh in (73:31 - 73:36)
the joural now will (73:33 - 73:36)
it uh oh yeah oh I did take a (73:37 - 73:43)
screenshot um it was 50,000 XP I was (73:39 - 73:46)
running lucky egg one rare candy One Max (73:43 - 73:48)
revive 30 Bulbasaur candy one Bulbasaur (73:46 - 73:51)
XL candy 10 premier balls so doubling it (73:48 - 73:52)
for so for (73:51 - 73:57)
$2 your two rare C XL two bubble (73:52 - 74:00)
Bulbasaur candy XL 30 or 60 Bulbasaur (73:57 - 74:03)
candy two Max revives 20 premier balls (74:00 - 74:05)
and then 100,000 (74:03 - 74:05)
XP for an extra $2 yeah I think it needs (74:06 - 74:12)
more XL (74:11 - 74:15)
candy rare (74:12 - 74:19)
candy yeah yeah because like $2 doubles (74:15 - 74:21)
all that but also doing another raid (74:19 - 74:24)
just gives you all of it yeah doing (74:21 - 74:26)
another raid but again that costs more (74:24 - 74:28)
MP (74:26 - 74:32)
so but 800 MP is only like a (74:28 - 74:35)
dollar so the really the only thing (74:32 - 74:36)
you&#39;re (74:35 - 74:39)
getting is double the pokeballs for a (74:36 - 74:41)
dollar (74:39 - 74:45)
yeah well MP MP is like (74:41 - 74:47)
a they do it in a way where you can (74:45 - 74:48)
never remember how much you&#39;re actually (74:47 - 74:52)
spending yeah it&#39;s 150 coins for 800 MP (74:48 - 74:53)
or if you buy it in a three-pack (74:52 - 74:57)
currently it&#39;s 5% off which is by the (74:53 - 75:02)
way the most offensive discount ever 5% (74:57 - 75:05)
off so that makes it instead of 150 that (75:02 - 75:09)
would make it (75:05 - 75:09)
143 so it is it is definitely cheaper to (75:09 - 75:14)
do another one but the problem is if (75:12 - 75:16)
you&#39;re not somewhere where there&#39;s (75:14 - 75:18)
enough people to do another one like (75:16 - 75:20)
after after I W after I left when I&#39;d (75:18 - 75:22)
done the four raids I think they were (75:20 - 75:25)
basically down to one group at that (75:22 - 75:26)
point (75:25 - 75:27)
pretty soon after that they wouldn&#39;t (75:26 - 75:29)
have been able to finish those raids in (75:27 - 75:32)
yeah yeah yeah the only reason we (75:29 - 75:34)
stopped doing raids was because the (75:32 - 75:37)
groups were just thinning out like so (75:34 - 75:40)
many people left after they like they (75:37 - 75:42)
caught one Charizard one Venusaur one (75:40 - 75:43)
Blastoise and then they were like okay (75:42 - 75:45)
I&#39;m good that&#39;s all I wanted and that&#39;s (75:43 - 75:48)
fine that&#39;s totally fine but like CU it (75:45 - 75:50)
cost money and they didn&#39;t provide any (75:48 - 75:53)
way for people to have more MP like they (75:50 - 75:55)
would on a raid day I think they if they (75:53 - 75:56)
want people to stick around they need to (75:55 - 75:58)
do the equivalent of giving people free (75:56 - 75:59)
raid (75:58 - 76:02)
passes more so than just the 800 for a (75:59 - 76:04)
checking (76:02 - 76:07)
in yeah which was only for Community (76:04 - 76:08)
ambassadors anyway I don&#39;t think it was (76:07 - 76:10)
for yep any Meetup if you if you had a (76:08 - 76:13)
Meetup that wasn&#39;t Community Ambassador (76:10 - 76:15)
you didn&#39;t get that yep did either of (76:13 - 76:18)
you run into anybody getting uh (76:15 - 76:21)
banned in that weird that happened after (76:18 - 76:23)
that that was like after I&#39;d gone to bed (76:21 - 76:27)
that that started so it wasn&#39;t (76:23 - 76:29)
okay I seems like a lot of it&#39;s been (76:27 - 76:31)
reversed at this point but there was (76:29 - 76:34)
some weird some (76:31 - 76:36)
of some people changed like they&#39;ve got (76:34 - 76:39)
one one day ban rather than a 7-Day ban (76:36 - 76:42)
which is an interesting change to (76:39 - 76:45)
that I don&#39;t know if any solid (76:42 - 76:47)
conclusions have come from it but just (76:45 - 76:50)
more more Niantic being Niantic and (76:47 - 76:52)
something went wrong and a ton of (76:50 - 76:54)
players were banned for seemingly no (76:52 - 76:58)
reason I think is at least my current (76:54 - 77:00)
understanding it&#39;s hard to know because (76:58 - 77:02)
Steve will probably bring up his uh (77:00 - 77:05)
point about uh the guy the people on (77:02 - 77:07)
stream that would say they had never (77:05 - 77:09)
time traveled in Animal Crossing but the (77:07 - 77:11)
thing they&#39;ve done wouldn&#39;t be possible (77:09 - 77:13)
without time time traveling right people (77:11 - 77:16)
do just lie it&#39;s true very true people (77:13 - 77:18)
do just lie 100% that a million percent (77:16 - 77:20)
of people that are like there were (77:18 - 77:21)
there&#39;s a handful of people that were (77:20 - 77:23)
like I&#39;ve never cheated before but like (77:21 - 77:26)
they they their accounts how ended up in (77:23 - 77:28)
Taiwan all of a sudden that&#39;s because (77:26 - 77:29)
they paid somebody to like log in and do (77:28 - 77:31)
raids and then send it back that&#39;s a (77:29 - 77:34)
real thing that happened um I don&#39;t know (77:31 - 77:38)
anything from the bands I saw I saw from (77:34 - 77:41)
what I saw it was a lot of children (77:38 - 77:43)
getting banned and it was because they (77:41 - 77:45)
were using a specific (77:43 - 77:48)
phone uh which the phone had its own (77:45 - 77:50)
Security on (77:48 - 77:53)
it uh and I don&#39;t know like like you (77:50 - 77:55)
know how like some children phones are (77:53 - 77:57)
only like like a specifically locked (77:55 - 78:00)
down phone that&#39;s designed for children (77:57 - 78:02)
yeah like I&#39;m thinking of like the (78:00 - 78:04)
Firefly phone which only had like four (78:02 - 78:06)
buttons it was like call Mom call Dad (78:04 - 78:09)
call emergency or like call the school (78:06 - 78:12)
or such a long time ago at this point (78:09 - 78:15)
iated than that now I don&#39;t think those (78:12 - 78:17)
phones can run Pokemon (78:15 - 78:21)
go but i&#39; but from what I saw it was it (78:17 - 78:23)
was like a lot of like my son or my (78:21 - 78:27)
child um I&#39;m not saying that that hasn&#39;t (78:23 - 78:29)
happened for non-child phones but that&#39;s (78:27 - 78:32)
just what I saw I was definitely seeing (78:29 - 78:34)
people on Reddit posting about it saying (78:32 - 78:36)
it happened to them so I would assume (78:34 - 78:40)
that it&#39;s not just children I would (78:36 - 78:40)
hope but I don&#39;t know just again more (78:40 - 78:48)
Niantic being Niantic I have one more (78:45 - 78:50)
complaint about Dynamax I have and then (78:48 - 78:51)
and then I&#39;ll stop complaining about (78:50 - 78:53)
Dynamax it&#39;s just a small (78:51 - 78:56)
thing if you go on Pokemon go and you (78:53 - 78:58)
you go into the nearby the Pokemon it&#39;s (78:56 - 79:00)
like a 9 by9 grid of Pokemon next to (78:58 - 79:03)
stops you go into the raids it&#39;s a 9 by9 (79:00 - 79:04)
grid of (79:03 - 79:08)
raids you then go on to the power spots (79:04 - 79:13)
it is a list cuz they&#39;re big they room (79:08 - 79:15)
why is it not a grid I have to scroll (79:13 - 79:17)
and the scrolling is terrible you start (79:15 - 79:18)
to scroll and you immediately move to (79:17 - 79:23)
the different tab it doesn&#39;t matter um (79:18 - 79:25)
your power spot MP whatever I I I think (79:23 - 79:27)
that&#39;s just still a little clunky to (79:25 - 79:29)
find in (79:27 - 79:32)
general yeah there&#39;s no indication as to (79:29 - 79:34)
how much you&#39;ve actually got today for (79:32 - 79:36)
example like trying to calculate how (79:34 - 79:39)
close am I to my 800 if you tap on if (79:36 - 79:42)
you tap on your it will tell you yeah (79:39 - 79:44)
how has nobody I complained about this (79:42 - 79:46)
multiple times also in the that&#39;s (79:44 - 79:49)
ridiculous in the in the gigant max (79:46 - 79:52)
raids if you just tap and hold on the (79:49 - 79:54)
four people it will show you their name (79:52 - 79:56)
and their level so you can see who (79:54 - 79:57)
you&#39;re playing with and then when you (79:56 - 80:00)
tap on the the amount of people it will (79:57 - 80:03)
show all of the people on the list and I (80:00 - 80:05)
believe the system is smart enough let&#39;s (80:03 - 80:07)
say you had (80:05 - 80:09)
like nine (80:07 - 80:11)
people it would be four four in one and (80:09 - 80:13)
that doesn&#39;t make sense right cuz that (80:11 - 80:16)
one person would be solo I have never (80:13 - 80:19)
seen it where it was 4 four in one when (80:16 - 80:22)
we had nine people it was it was like (80:19 - 80:26)
433 it moved people people around so no (80:22 - 80:28)
one was like actually (80:26 - 80:33)
solo 433 does sense it was 333 (80:28 - 80:33)
yeah um so like you I I don&#39;t think (80:33 - 80:39)
unless somebody like drops last minute (80:37 - 80:45)
or something you can be by yourself uh (80:39 - 80:47)
against (80:45 - 80:49)
whatever well like the like a failing in (80:47 - 80:53)
a matang can only be up to four so that (80:49 - 80:55)
that situation could never happen (80:53 - 80:57)
yeah I think a lot of people are coming (80:55 - 80:58)
out of this weekend being really (80:57 - 81:00)
frustrated with this feature for very (80:58 - 81:03)
valid reasons I think they didn&#39;t take (81:00 - 81:07)
it seriously a month ago like me yes (81:03 - 81:09)
because there wasn&#39;t a reason to because (81:07 - 81:12)
this is the reason to and I think that (81:09 - 81:16)
this helps us learn that and sure there (81:12 - 81:18)
are maybe some minor things that could (81:16 - 81:20)
be adjusted I still think it could use (81:18 - 81:22)
to be a guaranteed catch I also think (81:20 - 81:24)
that it needs slightly better Awards but (81:22 - 81:26)
I think (81:24 - 81:29)
this is exciting oh oh here&#39;s the thing (81:26 - 81:31)
I was going to say if they gave us more (81:29 - 81:33)
time let&#39;s say like this gigantamax (81:31 - 81:36)
stuff came out next month because I (81:33 - 81:37)
actually thought it was going to debut (81:36 - 81:40)
in Fukuoka and then Deb and then (81:37 - 81:43)
like the wild area whatever would be (81:40 - 81:45)
like the first time for everyone I think (81:43 - 81:48)
the same thing would happen yeah I I (81:45 - 81:51)
think giving players an extra month they (81:48 - 81:52)
still wouldn&#39;t have gone out to grind (81:51 - 81:54)
raids they still wouldn&#39;t have powered (81:52 - 81:56)
up Pokemon cuz there was no there was no (81:54 - 81:59)
reason to take it seriously until now (81:56 - 82:01)
yeah yeah yeah yeah so that&#39;s why going (81:59 - 82:03)
back circling all the way back that&#39;s (82:01 - 82:04)
why I was like surprised that Niantic (82:03 - 82:07)
did it so quickly within five weeks of (82:04 - 82:10)
debuting the system but I think they (82:07 - 82:12)
probably I think they probably (82:10 - 82:13)
understood that like this was going to (82:12 - 82:16)
be a wakeup call for people good or bad (82:13 - 82:17)
I think it&#39;s also probably given them (82:16 - 82:18)
lots of data to figure out if they want (82:17 - 82:21)
to change it um because obviously like (82:18 - 82:23)
we have slightly differing op opinions (82:21 - 82:25)
on how they should change it but I&#39;ll (82:23 - 82:27)
agree that there&#39;s probably some tweaks (82:25 - 82:30)
they should be doing to make it better (82:27 - 82:34)
um but what I&#39;m most interested to see (82:30 - 82:36)
is how quickly they roll out more so (82:34 - 82:39)
obviously we got three this weekend (82:36 - 82:41)
we&#39;re getting one next week and then (82:39 - 82:42)
we&#39;re getting (82:41 - 82:45)
another does it count as two technically (82:42 - 82:47)
because it&#39;s like two of the same (82:45 - 82:50)
form High (82:47 - 82:55)
yeah doesn&#39;t matter um the next month so (82:50 - 82:57)
it&#39;s nearly not quite another month cuz (82:55 - 83:02)
it&#39;s like was a month 4 days ago 23rd of (82:57 - 83:04)
November will they then continue that (83:02 - 83:06)
monthly like are we going to get one (83:04 - 83:09)
gigantamax a month because I feel like (83:06 - 83:11)
if yeah I would I would say this because (83:09 - 83:13)
if we got it every like I think it would (83:11 - 83:15)
be much harder to get people together (83:13 - 83:17)
for Gengar because it&#39;s so close (83:15 - 83:19)
together whereas if you have it once a (83:17 - 83:20)
month I could probably justify going (83:19 - 83:22)
into Edinburgh with Craig once a month (83:20 - 83:24)
right like that feels like a fun monthly (83:22 - 83:27)
thing to do with my son but every week (83:24 - 83:30)
absolutely not you know that&#39;s it&#39;s not (83:27 - 83:32)
going to happen yeah and if they do it (83:30 - 83:34)
once a month assuming that they don&#39;t do (83:32 - 83:36)
this again where they have three on the (83:34 - 83:38)
same weekend they can stretch it out (83:36 - 83:40)
over more than two (83:38 - 83:43)
years yeah oh yeah I don&#39;t think we&#39;re (83:40 - 83:46)
getting a new system at all like Z moves (83:43 - 83:48)
or terization or I don&#39;t think we&#39;re (83:46 - 83:51)
getting anything new in the sense (83:48 - 83:54)
of raids I guess mhm until the 10 year (83:51 - 83:56)
anniversary (83:54 - 83:59)
so which would be next year yeah so next (83:56 - 84:01)
year would be the (83:59 - 84:03)
the next summer would be the niney year (84:01 - 84:04)
anniversary and then after that would be (84:03 - 84:06)
10 years (84:04 - 84:08)
so um and they&#39;ll be a new gimmick in (84:06 - 84:10)
the main Series games so they&#39;re you (84:08 - 84:15)
know not catching up too quickly um uh I (84:10 - 84:19)
I I&#39;ve met the community Ambassador for (84:15 - 84:20)
in my area well there&#39;s a couple in my (84:19 - 84:23)
area I think one was one was sick or or (84:20 - 84:24)
out of town or something so they were (84:23 - 84:26)
supposed to be two there was only one um (84:24 - 84:28)
so that was really cool uh they were (84:26 - 84:31)
very nice they were the (84:28 - 84:33)
I the amount of work it takes to be a (84:31 - 84:36)
community Ambassador is just insane (84:33 - 84:39)
especially for a weekend like this yes (84:36 - 84:40)
especially when you have 200 people (84:39 - 84:43)
checking in uh I mean we Hannah and I (84:40 - 84:45)
did this in well we weren&#39;t Community (84:43 - 84:47)
ambassadors Hannah and I did this in in (84:45 - 84:50)
New York we we led a meet up it was on (84:47 - 84:53)
campfire it was on campfire we LED over (84:50 - 84:56)
a 100 people through Central Park (84:53 - 84:58)
um and that was that was cool that was (84:56 - 85:01)
awesome we did Venusaur first and then (84:58 - 85:03)
we walked to Charizard because it was (85:01 - 85:05)
the (85:03 - 85:08)
nearest wrong call we should have walked (85:05 - 85:10)
a little bit further to the Blastoise (85:08 - 85:13)
because we&#39;ve learned very quickly (85:10 - 85:15)
y (85:13 - 85:17)
soong keep those types in (85:15 - 85:19)
mind (85:17 - 85:24)
um yeah cuz we we were probably on Pace (85:19 - 85:26)
to do about for an hour and there was (85:24 - 85:29)
about seven in Mall of America so like (85:26 - 85:32)
there was one point where when we (85:29 - 85:34)
finished there was like 10 minutes left (85:32 - 85:37)
and it was like there&#39;s two here so why (85:34 - 85:38)
why would we leave the area let&#39;s just (85:37 - 85:39)
wait out the 10 minutes because people (85:38 - 85:41)
are catching anyways and then as soon as (85:39 - 85:43)
the time rolls over both will just (85:41 - 85:45)
appear right here again and we don&#39;t (85:43 - 85:48)
have to move a giant group um so I I&#39;m (85:45 - 85:49)
not again I&#39;m not trying to pick on (85:48 - 85:51)
anyone I think the community bastard was (85:49 - 85:52)
super great I&#39;m just saying that if (85:51 - 85:54)
you&#39;re in a mall where a lot of Pok√©mon (85:52 - 85:56)
go (85:54 - 85:59)
plays I I I felt a little awkward (85:56 - 86:01)
standing in the middle of a (85:59 - 86:01)
store I can understand that (86:01 - 86:06)
unfortunately M America&#39;s M America and (86:04 - 86:09)
Pacific is very big uh and they know (86:06 - 86:10)
that there&#39;s a lot of Pokemon go players (86:09 - 86:12)
that&#39;s like not a new thing to Mall of (86:10 - 86:14)
America by any means but uh there are (86:12 - 86:16)
gyms that are in the corners and it&#39;s (86:14 - 86:19)
because like one&#39;s like an LL Bean so (86:16 - 86:21)
the gym is like a giant boot in front of (86:19 - 86:23)
LL Bean so anytime I do that raid I (86:21 - 86:25)
literally walk through LL Bean and I go (86:23 - 86:27)
outside and then I do the raid outside (86:25 - 86:29)
and then I come back in because I I (86:27 - 86:31)
again I feel weird standing in (86:29 - 86:33)
somebody&#39;s store I mean just one person (86:31 - 86:36)
is a whole different uh experience than (86:33 - 86:39)
a 100 or 200 people walking through the (86:36 - 86:41)
store staring at their phones yeah I I (86:39 - 86:44)
would love to know if M of America have (86:41 - 86:46)
someone who works for them whose job it (86:44 - 86:49)
is to prepare for Pok√©mon go events CU (86:46 - 86:51)
it&#39;s like that feels like sure you (86:49 - 86:53)
probably have a lot of people just on a (86:51 - 86:55)
day-to-day basis but Sur it&#39;s a lot more (86:53 - 86:58)
when there&#39;s events and that feels like (86:55 - 87:00)
underestimating the size of Mall of (86:58 - 87:04)
America maybe maybe maybe I don&#39;t know (87:00 - 87:05)
the when M (87:04 - 87:08)
America when Pokemon go Community Day (87:05 - 87:10)
started uh and people were going to mall (87:08 - 87:12)
America more frequently for that they (87:10 - 87:15)
had signs up saying like if you&#39;re (87:12 - 87:17)
playing Pokemon go here and you are (87:15 - 87:19)
blocking people&#39;s ways in the walkway or (87:17 - 87:22)
the escalator specifically this is not (87:19 - 87:24)
this is not exclusive to like American (87:22 - 87:26)
things or just like the Mall of America (87:24 - 87:28)
where people will get to the top of an (87:26 - 87:29)
escalator or top of a staircase and then (87:28 - 87:30)
just stand there cuz they don&#39;t know (87:29 - 87:34)
where to go you get that everywhere like (87:30 - 87:35)
I I don&#39;t know why that&#39;s a thing of (87:34 - 87:38)
like even in like Tokyo where like you (87:35 - 87:39)
you&#39;re like climbing up the stairs and (87:38 - 87:40)
people are just standing at the top of (87:39 - 87:41)
the staircase like looking at their (87:40 - 87:42)
phone trying to figure out the maps it&#39;s (87:41 - 87:45)
like no just like take three steps over (87:42 - 87:47)
we&#39;re all trying to leave this train (87:45 - 87:50)
station um so there were at one point a (87:47 - 87:53)
big message to Pok√©mon go players being (87:50 - 87:55)
like we will kick you out of this mall (87:53 - 87:58)
if you are disrupting the flow of (87:55 - 88:00)
traffic in this (87:58 - 88:02)
mall yeah it&#39;s not hard to just move out (88:00 - 88:05)
people&#39;s we yeah yeah yeah yeah like we (88:02 - 88:08)
there was shout out to the one guy in (88:05 - 88:09)
Nordstrom who started playing the (88:08 - 88:12)
Pokemon theme song on a j a in a (88:09 - 88:14)
Bluetooth stereo he was definitely a (88:12 - 88:17)
ploy of a Nordstrom he knew exactly what (88:14 - 88:18)
was happening when that group of people (88:17 - 88:22)
came in we we did have one one (88:18 - 88:24)
experience where we were we were down (88:22 - 88:25)
cuz uh (88:24 - 88:27)
we mostly kind of went out of the the (88:25 - 88:29)
main shopping district in Edinburgh we (88:27 - 88:31)
were off on the side streets but that (88:29 - 88:32)
meant we were like around people&#39;s (88:31 - 88:36)
houses um their their tournaments and (88:32 - 88:37)
stuff like that and so there was a point (88:36 - 88:38)
where there were people coming out of a (88:37 - 88:41)
house to see a hundred people just (88:38 - 88:44)
standing outside their block of flats (88:41 - 88:45)
looking at them going what Earth is (88:44 - 88:47)
happening and someone just shouted (88:45 - 88:49)
Pokemon and they went oh okay I walked (88:47 - 88:51)
[Laughter] (88:49 - 88:54)
away and this is why I love Pok√©mon go I (88:51 - 88:58)
love those moments so much (88:54 - 89:02)
yeah yeah it was it was it was a good (88:58 - 89:04)
weekend long as you were in a group that (89:02 - 89:05)
could actually complete the raids well (89:04 - 89:08)
this is the thing like I I I actually I (89:05 - 89:10)
did enjoy myself but yeah if I if I (89:08 - 89:12)
hadn&#39;t managed to make it to Edinburgh I (89:10 - 89:13)
don&#39;t think it would have been possible (89:12 - 89:15)
for me I think there were two sets of (89:13 - 89:17)
people in Scotland that Managed IT and (89:15 - 89:19)
they were in the two cities to big (89:17 - 89:20)
cities no one else I think that either (89:19 - 89:23)
way it is a good new feature but it was (89:20 - 89:25)
only a good weekend if you were (89:23 - 89:27)
around people enough people or people (89:25 - 89:29)
prepared enough to actually complete (89:27 - 89:33)
these which again not everybody was MH (89:29 - 89:35)
yeah um and if there&#39;s if there&#39;s a (89:33 - 89:38)
takeaway here I think as as more of (89:35 - 89:40)
these raids come out and now we know the (89:38 - 89:43)
Baseline and now people have yeah these (89:40 - 89:44)
are good counters like once if you (89:43 - 89:47)
caught a Blastoise Venus or Charizard (89:44 - 89:50)
they&#39;re they&#39;re great even if it was (89:47 - 89:52)
like a bad three star or whatever like (89:50 - 89:54)
still worth powering up like they&#39;re (89:52 - 89:55)
still (89:54 - 89:58)
fantastic um but as people establish (89:55 - 90:00)
more and more counters going (89:58 - 90:02)
forward they should ideally get easier (90:00 - 90:04)
and easier and easier like I I I think (90:02 - 90:06)
Zoe said that she was able to do one (90:04 - 90:07)
with 14 (90:06 - 90:09)
people and so it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s (90:07 - 90:11)
realistic like we we did with one one (90:09 - 90:13)
with 20 people we almost did one with 17 (90:11 - 90:15)
people in my group that was one we (90:13 - 90:17)
failed but we wanted to try we were like (90:15 - 90:19)
legitimately like what&#39;s also cool just (90:17 - 90:20)
to heads up this is super cool we didn&#39;t (90:19 - 90:22)
talk about this at all if you fail a (90:20 - 90:25)
raid you get your 800 MP back you don&#39;t (90:22 - 90:28)
lose it at all so like when we were (90:25 - 90:30)
standing around being like Oh everyone (90:28 - 90:32)
left there&#39;s only 17 of us it was like (90:30 - 90:34)
let&#39;s just try this and we failed and (90:32 - 90:36)
we&#39;re like well okay no big deal let&#39;s (90:34 - 90:38)
go get lunch the problem is I want them (90:36 - 90:41)
to retroact add that to raids as well it (90:38 - 90:42)
now feels rubbish if you&#39;re ever in that (90:41 - 90:45)
situation with raids um I would try I (90:42 - 90:47)
would attempt I would attempt more raids (90:45 - 90:49)
on my own if if it worked that way cuz (90:47 - 90:50)
there are some three stars that are (90:49 - 90:53)
super easy and there are some that are (90:50 - 90:55)
maybe a little bit too much for you for (90:53 - 90:57)
one person um in some situations like (90:55 - 91:00)
yeah I I would try more of them if they (90:57 - 91:02)
if it only took it when you got when you (91:00 - 91:05)
add that to raids that would be (91:02 - 91:07)
fantastic all right let&#39;s take one more (91:05 - 91:09)
break and then we&#39;ll talk about we got (91:07 - 91:11)
some scarlet and violet news so we will (91:09 - 91:12)
be right (91:11 - 91:15)
back and we are back from our break (91:12 - 91:19)
celebrate the spooky system (91:15 - 91:22)
system not quite celebrate the spooky (91:19 - 91:26)
season with rare candy G L from Monday (91:22 - 91:28)
October 28th to Thursday October 31st (91:26 - 91:31)
Gengar will appear in five star raids (91:28 - 91:35)
we&#39;ll have Ghost terot type uh defeating (91:31 - 91:37)
Gengar will include a lot of festive (91:35 - 91:40)
rewards including a ton of rare (91:37 - 91:45)
candy and yeah five star Terror raids um (91:40 - 91:46)
a bit of a bummer it&#39;s not a sevenstar (91:45 - 91:48)
Gengar because I think that would have (91:46 - 91:52)
been super cool uh (91:48 - 91:55)
but thematically they just want you to (91:52 - 91:56)
knock out Gengar relatively easy to (91:55 - 91:59)
stock up on rare candy (91:56 - 92:02)
yeah which I guess is (91:59 - 92:04)
fine I mean I&#39;m happy with it because I (92:02 - 92:06)
have used up most of my candy now from (92:04 - 92:10)
the uh trying to get my my decks (92:06 - 92:11)
finished in (92:10 - 92:15)
home uh yeah got to do that now&#39;s a good (92:11 - 92:17)
time to be able to stock up on Candy to (92:15 - 92:19)
get that shiny meoa yeah that&#39;s true (92:17 - 92:20)
because you could just catch a bell (92:19 - 92:23)
sprout evolve it to a weeping Bell (92:20 - 92:24)
evolve it to a victory bell why Always (92:23 - 92:26)
bell sprout that&#39;s the one you always (92:24 - 92:28)
seem to CH because the one I&#39;m (92:26 - 92:30)
missing even though I have a Million (92:28 - 92:32)
Bell Sprouts in other games it&#39;s the (92:30 - 92:35)
what I&#39;m missing in scarlet and (92:32 - 92:35)
violet it&#39;s it&#39;s a good one to (92:36 - 92:41)
have uh they&#39;re also doing another Mass (92:39 - 92:45)
outbreak event from Monday October 28th (92:41 - 92:49)
to Thursday October 31st Gastly Mis dous (92:45 - 92:51)
Shuppet and brambling will appear in the (92:49 - 92:53)
Pala region this is a little bit of a (92:51 - 92:55)
bummer there&#39;s no nothing for kakami (92:53 - 92:57)
or uh (92:55 - 93:00)
blueberry uh these Pokemon will most (92:57 - 93:02)
likely more likely to have the crafty (93:00 - 93:05)
Mark so fun catching these opportunist (93:02 - 93:07)
opportunistic Ghost (93:05 - 93:09)
Pokemon so no increase for (93:07 - 93:12)
shiny um although if you&#39;ve been doing (93:09 - 93:14)
Seven Star raids recently you&#39;ll (93:12 - 93:16)
probably have a lot of herb mysa or if (93:14 - 93:18)
you&#39;re trying to get your Meloetta you (93:16 - 93:21)
probably have the shiny charm (93:18 - 93:24)
hopefully uh is this they did a (93:21 - 93:26)
Halloween event last year it was like um (93:24 - 93:29)
how G (93:26 - 93:29)
gri probably maybe (93:30 - 93:35)
drifloon I can&#39;t remember a year ago I (93:33 - 93:37)
can&#39;t remember but I think I think I (93:35 - 93:39)
think brin&#39;s like newer I don&#39;t think (93:37 - 93:41)
they&#39;ve done a an event with bramin (93:39 - 93:44)
maybe I&#39;m misremembering but uh when (93:41 - 93:48)
they do increased Mark it&#39;s usually 5% (93:44 - 93:50)
so you have a one in 20 chance of a (93:48 - 93:51)
Pokemon you catch to have the (93:50 - 93:55)
Mark um and that Mark takes Priority (93:51 - 93:57)
First so if it doesn&#39;t roll for that (93:55 - 94:00)
Mark then it will roll for the other (93:57 - 94:03)
marks behind it so all in all more (94:00 - 94:07)
chance of just getting a marked shiny if (94:03 - 94:08)
that&#39;s what you care about I don&#39;t there (94:07 - 94:09)
are probably people out there that just (94:08 - 94:11)
care about marks I&#39;m sure they exist (94:09 - 94:13)
where they want a Mark or a certain Mark (94:11 - 94:15)
probably not as common as shiny (94:13 - 94:18)
Hunters but there are the shiny Mark (94:15 - 94:22)
Hunters so yeah I suspect they&#39;re (94:18 - 94:24)
probably the same people (94:22 - 94:25)
like I don&#39;t think anybody cares about (94:24 - 94:27)
marks and doesn&#39;t care about shinies (94:25 - 94:29)
they&#39;ve just finished they finished on (94:27 - 94:32)
chines and now they&#39;re onto something (94:29 - 94:37)
else yeah I mean I would I would (94:32 - 94:39)
like it would be cool to have like a (94:37 - 94:42)
crar of every single (94:39 - 94:45)
Mark although that would be relatively (94:42 - 94:47)
that would be (94:45 - 94:50)
hard because even though the rare Mark (94:47 - 94:53)
is the rarest Mark there&#39;s like 20 some (94:50 - 94:55)
personality marks (94:53 - 94:59)
so trying to get all 20 you can only get (94:55 - 95:01)
one for catching on I know there&#39;s like (94:59 - 95:03)
some you can get like this the Treasure (95:01 - 95:04)
Hunter and stuff like that but you can (95:03 - 95:06)
only get one when you catch it right (95:04 - 95:08)
it&#39;s not possible to get more than right (95:06 - 95:10)
right right right so if you got like the (95:08 - 95:12)
birthday Mark that would cancel out (95:10 - 95:14)
every other Mark except for the big and (95:12 - 95:16)
small because you have to like talk to (95:14 - 95:17)
somebody to earn that you add them on (95:16 - 95:20)
later yeah so you could like the most (95:17 - 95:22)
you could get is big and small and an (95:20 - 95:24)
extra and then you would add on the (95:22 - 95:26)
treasure the (95:24 - 95:30)
cooking cooking mhm yeah sandwich one or (95:26 - 95:35)
whatever it&#39;s called Gourmand yeah yeah (95:30 - 95:36)
there&#39;s two marks that are not in (95:35 - 95:39)
scarlet and violet uh which is the dry (95:36 - 95:41)
Mark which is like intense heat because (95:39 - 95:43)
nowhere in scarlet and violet is intense (95:41 - 95:47)
heat and then the no there&#39;s three (95:43 - 95:50)
there&#39;s the the cooking the curry (95:47 - 95:53)
Mark and then the fishing Mark I don&#39;t (95:50 - 95:54)
know if you guys know this there&#39;s no (95:53 - 95:57)
fishing in scarlet and violet it&#39;s very (95:54 - 95:59)
weird I had not thought about that till (95:57 - 96:01)
now I guess I didn&#39;t miss (95:59 - 96:05)
[Laughter] (96:01 - 96:05)
it no fishing I kind of I don&#39;t know I (96:05 - 96:11)
think fishing is one of those things (96:09 - 96:14)
that I feel like need to rework too did (96:11 - 96:15)
you play you play a lot of fishing games (96:14 - 96:18)
Al well I play a lot of games that have (96:15 - 96:19)
fishing in them that doesn&#39;t mean I like (96:18 - 96:22)
fishing uh I think a I think most (96:19 - 96:25)
fishing mini games are not great (96:22 - 96:26)
um you don&#39;t like the one in stard (96:25 - 96:29)
Valley the stard valley one is fine I (96:26 - 96:31)
think it gets a bad WAP because it&#39;s (96:29 - 96:33)
very difficult to start with but as you (96:31 - 96:36)
do more of it it becomes (96:33 - 96:38)
easier um although they did improve that (96:36 - 96:42)
later on when they added uh there&#39;s like (96:38 - 96:45)
a new Rod that only works for lowlevel (96:42 - 96:47)
fish but it&#39;s much easier so you can (96:45 - 96:50)
build up your your level that way and uh (96:47 - 96:52)
compared to most other fishing mini (96:50 - 96:54)
games the Pokemon one is usually pretty (96:52 - 96:58)
uh boring but I can&#39;t actually imagine (96:54 - 97:02)
it being feeling like Pokemon if it was (96:58 - 97:04)
more complicated I don&#39;t know a rework (97:02 - 97:06)
would be interesting well the problem (97:04 - 97:08)
with have you ever built a sandwich in (97:06 - 97:10)
one of these games that&#39;s not (97:08 - 97:14)
exactly fun or easy well this is the (97:10 - 97:16)
problem right like you can either go (97:14 - 97:17)
really simple like Pokemon like Animal (97:16 - 97:19)
Crossing where it&#39;s just you&#39;re just (97:17 - 97:21)
pressing the button at the right time um (97:19 - 97:23)
or you go more complicated and then you (97:21 - 97:25)
have people complaining because it&#39;s too (97:23 - 97:29)
difficult so you I feel like there is no (97:25 - 97:32)
good balance (97:29 - 97:34)
there you&#39;re always going to have (97:32 - 97:36)
someone complaining that something&#39;s too (97:34 - 97:37)
difficult though we had a whole weekend (97:36 - 97:40)
of it actually in Pokemon (97:37 - 97:40)
go and right like that we&#39;re back on (97:41 - 97:48)
[Laughter] (97:44 - 97:48)
gigant (97:49 - 97:53)
um yeah you know there there&#39;s there&#39;s (97:51 - 97:56)
like a lot of things I feel like could (97:53 - 97:59)
be reinvented in main series Pokemon (97:56 - 98:02)
games like I I think I think eggs are (97:59 - 98:05)
not in a great space well they tried to (98:02 - 98:08)
change things up with these new games (98:05 - 98:10)
the I think the improved eggs in some (98:08 - 98:12)
ways but also made it worse in other (98:10 - 98:14)
ways I (98:12 - 98:17)
think I love being able to do eggs (98:14 - 98:19)
wherever like that I mean that&#39;s what we (98:17 - 98:21)
were asking for for years don&#39;t make me (98:19 - 98:24)
have to go to a building to do this (98:21 - 98:26)
um the problem is that they wanted to (98:24 - 98:28)
tie in sandwiches really hard to it and (98:26 - 98:30)
go well we&#39;re going to just going to (98:28 - 98:32)
make it really hard to do without a (98:30 - 98:33)
sandwich so we&#39;re going to make you have (98:32 - 98:35)
a sandwich and then he just like well (98:33 - 98:37)
I&#39;m doing the sandwich to give me half (98:35 - 98:40)
decent odds that that was the the weird (98:37 - 98:41)
thing about that I I think if they just (98:40 - 98:44)
improved the rate at which you got (98:41 - 98:48)
eggs most of the annoyances go (98:44 - 98:53)
away hear me out you build a spa and (98:48 - 98:55)
then before before you go to bed you put (98:53 - 98:58)
like 20 eggs in it and then when you (98:55 - 99:00)
wake up the next morning they&#39;re ready (98:58 - 99:02)
to go they did this in a game called (99:00 - 99:06)
Ultra Sun Ultra Moon and it was (99:02 - 99:08)
fantastic but that&#39;s still hatching eggs (99:06 - 99:11)
and not getting eggs in the first yeah (99:08 - 99:12)
yeah yeah that&#39;s true that&#39;s true yeah (99:11 - 99:13)
but having to go back and forth I think (99:12 - 99:16)
a big part of the problem in scarlet and (99:13 - 99:18)
violet is that you can&#39;t go and hatch (99:16 - 99:20)
them while you&#39;re getting the eggs you (99:18 - 99:22)
can&#39;t do it all at the same time that&#39;s (99:20 - 99:24)
fair (99:22 - 99:26)
yeah I this is coming from somebody (99:24 - 99:29)
who&#39;s just done Crystal breeding (99:26 - 99:29)
which which like is it is an interesting (99:30 - 99:36)
system and it&#39;s funny because I I I made (99:33 - 99:39)
a YouTube video on how to breed in (99:36 - 99:42)
Crystal how to shiny breed and Crystal (99:39 - 99:44)
and then I went to do it this past (99:42 - 99:48)
weekend and I forgot and I had to watch (99:44 - 99:52)
my own YouTube video to remember how to (99:48 - 99:56)
do it I mean folks that&#39;s how good it is (99:52 - 99:57)
but it it (99:56 - 100:00)
was it was really different like uh I (99:57 - 100:02)
mean there there are some changes that (100:00 - 100:05)
are that are still here like obviously (100:02 - 100:07)
in Crystal if you have a Pokemon with a (100:05 - 100:10)
different ID number trainer ID number (100:07 - 100:12)
that that helps and obviously that&#39;s (100:10 - 100:13)
like the kind of the same for massuda (100:12 - 100:16)
except Regional (100:13 - 100:18)
um but I (100:16 - 100:21)
would I would love to see a whole new (100:18 - 100:23)
breeding system I would love to see like (100:21 - 100:26)
a the whole new fishing (100:23 - 100:30)
system them adding marks to (100:26 - 100:33)
Pokemon and sizes to (100:30 - 100:37)
Pokemon give you more of a reason to (100:33 - 100:40)
catch Pokemon you&#39;ve caught (100:37 - 100:44)
before which I think is great uh there (100:40 - 100:46)
you know people argued that they didn&#39;t (100:44 - 100:48)
like some people really liked the (100:46 - 100:50)
catching an archus some people (100:48 - 100:53)
didn&#39;t I think I loved it because at the (100:50 - 100:55)
same same time if you didn&#39;t like it you (100:53 - 100:57)
could just run into said Pokemon and (100:55 - 101:00)
then do the traditional catching like it (100:57 - 101:03)
was both there which is great um I I (101:00 - 101:05)
also what one thing I loved about (101:03 - 101:10)
Legends is they not only gave you all (101:05 - 101:12)
tools to make it quicker to catch which (101:10 - 101:15)
obviously I love um but (101:12 - 101:20)
also when you released Pok√©mon you got (101:15 - 101:22)
something from that so if you spent ages (101:20 - 101:25)
shiny hunting in C I didn&#39;t even think (101:22 - 101:28)
of that Al it it was such a cuz (101:25 - 101:30)
especially in a game (101:28 - 101:32)
where you you know you need to keep (101:30 - 101:34)
getting the balls and you&#39;re not gaining (101:32 - 101:36)
money in any other way giving you (101:34 - 101:37)
because they did that in in let&#39;s go as (101:36 - 101:42)
well like you got the candy the the like (101:37 - 101:44)
the courage candy or whatever when (101:42 - 101:47)
catching which gave you the ability to (101:44 - 101:50)
then buy more balls um I think is just a (101:47 - 101:52)
a fantastic way to do it I didn&#39;t even (101:50 - 101:54)
think about throwing away all of these (101:52 - 101:55)
Pokemon in scarlet and violet and (101:54 - 101:58)
getting nothing for doing that it&#39;s so (101:55 - 102:00)
painful I mean I just don&#39;t catch (101:58 - 102:02)
Pokemon in scarlet and violet as much (102:00 - 102:03)
like I only catch the Pokemon I actually (102:02 - 102:06)
care about because the process is so (102:03 - 102:08)
tedious compared to Legends AR yeah it (102:06 - 102:10)
would be interesting if like you threw (102:08 - 102:11)
away a marked Pokemon if it would give (102:10 - 102:13)
you like a little bit more candy because (102:11 - 102:15)
it it had a mark on it or something or (102:13 - 102:17)
not Cy had Pokemon go around for a long (102:15 - 102:21)
time haven&#39;t we yeah like as much (102:17 - 102:26)
as as much as Pok√©mon go is not (102:21 - 102:27)
everyone&#39;s cup of (102:26 - 102:30)
tea I think some of the things they&#39;ve (102:27 - 102:34)
done make you rethink of like what the (102:30 - 102:36)
main series is (102:34 - 102:40)
doing and I I there are things that are (102:36 - 102:42)
make no sense like I&#39;m going to use a (102:40 - 102:44)
fast TM to hopefully get a move that I (102:42 - 102:45)
need and oh I didn&#39;t so I got to use a (102:44 - 102:47)
fast TM like four more times just to get (102:45 - 102:49)
like Sucker Punch on my Gengar or (102:47 - 102:54)
whatever that&#39;s super annoying still but (102:49 - 102:57)
yeah thankfully I have enough Elite TMS (102:54 - 103:00)
because I never used them (102:57 - 103:02)
before that I was using them for the my (103:00 - 103:05)
Dynamax Pokemon I even think about that (103:02 - 103:07)
too because I have all the gigantamax (103:05 - 103:09)
now so I could and I have like 12 Elite (103:07 - 103:11)
TMS because I&#39;ve never used them I could (103:09 - 103:15)
give them each hydr Cannon frenzy plant (103:11 - 103:19)
there you go but they&#39;re not (103:15 - 103:21)
shiny well that&#39;s the other thing oh (103:19 - 103:23)
goodness we&#39;re back on goal I I only saw (103:21 - 103:26)
one person out of our 120 or so (103:23 - 103:29)
throughout four raids only one of them I (103:26 - 103:31)
saw get a shiny really oh really I saw (103:29 - 103:34)
so many people get shinies I was jealous (103:31 - 103:36)
I think I think they were one in 20 it (103:34 - 103:39)
could be that people just weren&#39;t saying (103:36 - 103:41)
it odd oh you&#39;re playing with some (103:39 - 103:42)
Japanese (103:41 - 103:45)
players oh shiny it doesn&#39;t matter no I (103:42 - 103:46)
I feel like people would be more (103:45 - 103:48)
enthusiastic maybe they just don&#39;t care (103:46 - 103:51)
maybe I don&#39;t know I would have be maybe (103:48 - 103:52)
they weren excited because they&#39;ve (103:51 - 103:54)
already had like shiny Charizard or (103:52 - 103:57)
Blastoise or venur the shiny gigantamax (103:54 - 103:58)
looked pretty darn cool well exactly (103:57 - 104:00)
you&#39;re seeing it in gigantamax form when (103:58 - 104:02)
you&#39;re catching it (104:00 - 104:05)
yeah which is also by the way better (104:02 - 104:07)
than what raids do because if you have a (104:05 - 104:09)
raid that&#39;s in a like a mega raid it (104:07 - 104:10)
then turns not into the mega when you&#39;re (104:09 - 104:12)
catching it and it&#39;s just not as (104:10 - 104:16)
impactful MH I yeah I think I think they (104:12 - 104:18)
look so cool and that was part of the (104:16 - 104:20)
reason why I wanted to grind them out I (104:18 - 104:23)
was like I just want I just want like a (104:20 - 104:26)
90 anything over 90 really so I can (104:23 - 104:28)
invest in it and be good cuz you know (104:26 - 104:30)
you can still roll low IVs there was a (104:28 - 104:32)
couple couple that weren&#39;t super (104:30 - 104:34)
fantastic but it was like I&#39;m getting (104:32 - 104:36)
more candy I&#39;m getting more experience (104:34 - 104:38)
I&#39;m having a good time I&#39;m hopefully (104:36 - 104:41)
maybe going to get a shiny I got I got I (104:38 - 104:44)
got three that are fantastic IVs I think (104:41 - 104:47)
like 96 96 98 so but no (104:44 - 104:51)
shiny I think I I think the Kyle from (104:47 - 104:53)
goast I think they got two shinies in 15 (104:51 - 104:58)
raids um and both were like very bad IVs (104:53 - 105:01)
and it was like but if we were lucky and (104:58 - 105:03)
I got a shiny we could have traded and (105:01 - 105:05)
then they would rerolled IVs and we both (105:03 - 105:08)
have lucky Shiny gigantamax Pokemon that (105:05 - 105:09)
sounds (105:08 - 105:11)
fantastic when are they bringing bottle (105:09 - 105:14)
caps to go that&#39;s the real question yeah (105:11 - 105:16)
oh we didn&#39;t we didn&#39;t talk about that (105:14 - 105:18)
the max soup like Max soup has to be (105:16 - 105:21)
coming yeah in two (105:18 - 105:24)
years no maybe not two years a it&#39;s not (105:21 - 105:26)
yeah two years come on for money and in (105:24 - 105:28)
two years yeah maybe not maybe not in (105:26 - 105:30)
maybe not in exactly two years but it&#39;s (105:28 - 105:32)
not happening next year it&#39;ll happen I (105:30 - 105:33)
would say summer I would I would say (105:32 - 105:35)
summer they they do Max soup no I think (105:33 - 105:36)
it&#39;s (105:35 - 105:38)
2026 you don&#39;t think so you don&#39;t think (105:36 - 105:41)
summer no how well how much do you (105:38 - 105:44)
charge for a Max soup pfin is 200 Team (105:41 - 105:47)
Rocket radar is 200 how much should they (105:44 - 105:52)
charge $1 how much will they charge $2 (105:47 - 105:55)
five (105:52 - 105:57)
500 they started this system not letting (105:55 - 106:00)
us turn any of our existing Pokemon into (105:57 - 106:02)
even Dynamax Pokemon they are not going (106:00 - 106:05)
to make it easy will they have two (106:02 - 106:06)
different soups will they have Dynamax (106:05 - 106:09)
soup and gigantamax soup I don&#39;t think (106:06 - 106:11)
they&#39;re going to make it possible for us (106:09 - 106:13)
to turn on Dynamax Pokemon into Dynamax (106:11 - 106:15)
Pokemon I really hope they do One D like (106:13 - 106:17)
I understand really hope they do but I (106:15 - 106:20)
at this point I understand here&#39;s here&#39;s (106:17 - 106:22)
a question sorry sorry we&#39;re going back (106:20 - 106:25)
to Pokemon go um (106:22 - 106:28)
a master ball is ultimately like eight (106:25 - 106:31)
yeah and I I&#39;ve seen people with like (106:28 - 106:33)
four master balls in their inventory and (106:31 - 106:34)
they&#39;re like I&#39;m I&#39;m never going to use (106:33 - 106:37)
these I&#39;m stocking up I don&#39;t remember (106:34 - 106:38)
when the third master ball came through (106:37 - 106:40)
or whatever I have two master balls I&#39;ve (106:38 - 106:44)
never used a master ball I had three and (106:40 - 106:46)
I&#39;ve used all three I used them all on (106:44 - 106:47)
the Galler (106:46 - 106:50)
Birds yeah okay I was like cuz I know (106:47 - 106:52)
I&#39;m not going to use it on anything else (106:50 - 106:55)
I going to on the thing that I very (106:52 - 106:59)
rarely see mhm I I I I only have two I (106:55 - 107:00)
never got a third or a four I didn&#39;t do (106:59 - 107:01)
the fourth one cuz I didn&#39;t want to (107:00 - 107:03)
spend 8 because my thought process was (107:01 - 107:05)
what am I going to use this on I could (107:03 - 107:06)
use it on the Galler Birds but if I run (107:05 - 107:08)
into a shiny one it&#39;s it&#39;s ultimately (107:06 - 107:10)
guaranteed yeah yeah I wouldn&#39;t use it (107:08 - 107:12)
for a shiny (107:10 - 107:14)
one but this was before the shinies were (107:12 - 107:16)
released I have all three now I mean I (107:14 - 107:18)
would if if if I ran into like (107:16 - 107:21)
a wait can the gigantamax Pokemon be (107:18 - 107:25)
tiny or big (107:21 - 107:25)
can you get like a a good question (107:25 - 107:30)
presumably they have sizes right yeah (107:27 - 107:32)
assum would have (107:30 - 107:35)
sizes uh but if I ran into like (107:32 - 107:38)
100% (107:35 - 107:41)
humongo I (107:38 - 107:44)
landeras I have I have an extra small (107:41 - 107:46)
gigantamax Charizard so presumably they (107:44 - 107:48)
can also be extra extra small and extra (107:46 - 107:50)
extra large but I haven&#39;t seen whether (107:48 - 107:53)
they would have the the animation (107:50 - 107:54)
whether it would be clear on the catch (107:53 - 107:58)
screen or not (107:54 - 107:58)
yeah someone has to have encountered (108:00 - 108:04)
that right they surely will have put it (108:02 - 108:05)
on self (108:04 - 108:11)
road yeah yeah all mine are like normal (108:05 - 108:15)
sizes which is the most common size is (108:11 - 108:17)
normal um yeah so a master ball is (108:15 - 108:19)
ultimately (108:17 - 108:24)
$8 plus a lot of effort (108:19 - 108:26)
yeah but like the whole point of like (108:24 - 108:28)
spending money in Pokemon go is just a (108:26 - 108:31)
like time (108:28 - 108:36)
skip no GX Pokemon can be extra extra (108:31 - 108:38)
small there are definitely people who (108:36 - 108:40)
got that in the last day did they say (108:38 - 108:42)
whether the animation was there or not (108:40 - 108:44)
I&#39;m not seeing any pictures of the (108:42 - 108:46)
animation (108:44 - 108:46)
happening I would I would guess Max soup (108:47 - 108:51)
would probably be this is what I would (108:49 - 108:53)
guess I&#39;m looking at the the I would (108:51 - 108:56)
guess Max soup would be 600 coins (108:53 - 108:58)
because you can&#39;t buy 600 coins you can (108:56 - 109:00)
only buy 550 (108:58 - 109:04)
coins uhuh y that would make sense so I (109:00 - 109:07)
I would guess 600 coins for a Max suit (109:04 - 109:10)
it&#39;s the 10 pack in Pocket all over (109:07 - 109:12)
again or they do it where Max soup is (109:10 - 109:15)
only available in some like $10 bundle (109:12 - 109:18)
like the elite TMS (109:15 - 109:21)
mhm yeah well this is the funny thing I (109:18 - 109:24)
I ended up buying (109:21 - 109:26)
there was a bundle for was it one of the (109:24 - 109:29)
seasonal tickets I think that also (109:26 - 109:34)
included one set of Max particles so I (109:29 - 109:36)
didn&#39;t end up purchasing Max particles (109:34 - 109:38)
because I was buying the ticket anyway (109:36 - 109:39)
and it made it the same price (109:38 - 109:45)
essentially uhhuh so do you have bought (109:39 - 109:48)
some technically I purchased a bundle (109:45 - 109:51)
that had some in it yes yes although (109:48 - 109:53)
annoyingly that one did not come (109:51 - 109:57)
as the like 800 item it just immediately (109:53 - 109:59)
went into your (109:57 - 110:00)
inventory which was a bit annoying (109:59 - 110:01)
because then you have to use it all up (110:00 - 110:04)
before you can get any (110:01 - 110:04)
more (110:05 - 110:10)
yeah Max particles are the how that (110:08 - 110:12)
inventory is just how you view that (110:10 - 110:13)
inventory is just like really weird (110:12 - 110:16)
still yeah of like collecting having a (110:13 - 110:18)
limit going over your limit having some (110:16 - 110:20)
purchased yeah that that definitely (110:18 - 110:23)
needs to be redesigned M particles are (110:20 - 110:26)
I think they should have at one of those (110:23 - 110:29)
one of those limits either you have a (110:26 - 110:31)
Max on how much you can keep at once or (110:29 - 110:34)
you have a Max of how much you can do a (110:31 - 110:37)
day and I think that would make it much (110:34 - 110:41)
clearer to people and also feel (110:37 - 110:44)
better yeah I think I agree with (110:41 - 110:47)
that I see what you&#39;re (110:44 - 110:47)
saying yeah or well because you&#39;re (110:48 - 110:52)
actually you actually have three limits (110:50 - 110:54)
on what you can do (110:52 - 110:55)
because there&#39;s how many you can get in (110:54 - 110:58)
a DAT there&#39;s how many you can have (110:55 - 111:00)
which is a thousand and then there&#39;s how (110:58 - 111:03)
much you can get from one stop which is (111:00 - 111:05)
just one like 120 if you&#39;ve not been (111:03 - 111:07)
there before and 100 if you have been (111:05 - 111:09)
there before so it&#39;s actually three (111:07 - 111:10)
technically (111:09 - 111:12)
limits if we want to get because like a (111:10 - 111:14)
pok√© stop you can spin it as many times (111:12 - 111:18)
as you want right yeah in a day you just (111:14 - 111:20)
it&#39;s hard to keep track of the limits on (111:18 - 111:22)
this I get why there is a limit because (111:20 - 111:25)
they want the 800 to be equivalent to (111:22 - 111:28)
one free raid pass I understand that so (111:25 - 111:34)
that like one free 6star raid (111:28 - 111:38)
pass but yeah it&#39;s weird hitting 800 and (111:34 - 111:39)
them being like you can&#39;t earn any more (111:38 - 111:40)
and it&#39;s (111:39 - 111:45)
like but I can earn 200 more technically (111:40 - 111:47)
yeah that&#39;s the problem they tried to (111:45 - 111:49)
make it a more flexible and useful (111:47 - 111:51)
system while keeping the same (111:49 - 111:53)
restriction on it that you have when (111:51 - 111:55)
it&#39;s just one item because the Daily (111:53 - 111:58)
raid pass doesn&#39;t feel weird because (111:55 - 112:01)
it&#39;s just you have one and you can only (111:58 - 112:04)
hold one you can only hold one so once (112:01 - 112:06)
you use it you can get another one the (112:04 - 112:08)
next day right it&#39;s really simple to (112:06 - 112:10)
understand but because it&#39;s now hundreds (112:08 - 112:13)
of them it gets much more confusing plus (112:10 - 112:17)
with the Daily raid pass any not free so (112:13 - 112:20)
any of the paid raid passes that aren&#39;t (112:17 - 112:22)
remote you can hold as many of those as (112:20 - 112:23)
you want (112:22 - 112:25)
which you can do with the max particles (112:23 - 112:28)
as well except that one weird one where (112:25 - 112:29)
they gave you the particles rather than (112:28 - 112:31)
the item that is the particles because (112:29 - 112:34)
you just have the the the packs in your (112:31 - 112:36)
inventry and you use them when you want (112:34 - 112:39)
to um so that is good can you tell I (112:36 - 112:42)
haven&#39;t bought any max particles before (112:39 - 112:44)
it was it was weird it was weird for me (112:42 - 112:45)
using them for the first time because (112:44 - 112:49)
that was the first time I bought them um (112:45 - 112:52)
which they just used automatically (112:49 - 112:55)
because I only had 300 Max particles (112:52 - 112:57)
left but I couldn&#39;t earn any more so (112:55 - 112:59)
when I was going into the raid it was (112:57 - 113:00)
like the animation was like the raid (112:59 - 113:03)
pass animation and it was just like oh (113:00 - 113:06)
you&#39;re spending 800 yeah so I never (113:03 - 113:08)
really saw them in my inventory because (113:06 - 113:09)
I was already depleted and then I did (113:08 - 113:11)
three raids in a row and then it was (113:09 - 113:12)
like do you want to buy more and I was (113:11 - 113:15)
like sure (113:12 - 113:19)
do I guess this is why some it&#39;s I&#39;m not (113:15 - 113:21)
a huge fan of like the the gacha games (113:19 - 113:23)
that have the free and the paid diamond (113:21 - 113:25)
and it just ends up being a bit awkward (113:23 - 113:27)
and confusing (113:25 - 113:30)
but this I can&#39;t I can&#39;t decide which (113:27 - 113:32)
one&#39;s better I feel like this one&#39;s (113:30 - 113:37)
better where you have like packs of them (113:32 - 113:39)
and so you can use them when they want I (113:37 - 113:41)
think however you do this slightly more (113:39 - 113:44)
sense but yeah well speaking of packs (113:41 - 113:47)
TCG pocket is coming out this week so (113:44 - 113:49)
that&#39;ll be a conversation for next week (113:47 - 113:53)
everyone will get to play it uh so I (113:49 - 113:56)
guess be excited for next week if you&#39;re (113:53 - 113:59)
going to dabble in TCG pocket (113:56 - 114:02)
um I I have already committed to buying (113:59 - 114:03)
the monthly (114:02 - 114:06)
pass Hannah are you going free to play (114:03 - 114:08)
I&#39;m definitely starting free to play (114:06 - 114:10)
okay (114:08 - 114:12)
okay so we already we don&#39;t Bobby (114:10 - 114:14)
doesn&#39;t even have to be here to know (114:12 - 114:17)
that Bobby is spending easily a $100 on (114:14 - 114:20)
day one uh Al what how you feeling about (114:17 - 114:23)
pocket yeah I mean I think the game (114:20 - 114:26)
overall looks pretty great um I I it&#39;s (114:23 - 114:28)
it&#39;s much more leaning towards the (114:26 - 114:30)
collection heavy stuff that I like you (114:28 - 114:32)
know um probably going to ignore the (114:30 - 114:35)
battles most of the time you know my (114:32 - 114:37)
daily card game battling is still going (114:35 - 114:40)
to be with SNAP I think uh whether I I&#39;m (114:37 - 114:41)
undecided on the (114:40 - 114:44)
premium because I do like the idea of (114:41 - 114:49)
extra packs but I also feel like that (114:44 - 114:51)
could go up and down as time goes on (114:49 - 114:52)
right like once you get close to (114:51 - 114:56)
finishing a set maybe I stopped (114:52 - 115:00)
purchasing the premium at that (114:56 - 115:02)
point I part of the problem is we don&#39;t (115:00 - 115:03)
know how often they&#39;re going to add new (115:02 - 115:05)
stuff to this right yeah yeah well that (115:03 - 115:07)
was one of the questions I that was (115:05 - 115:09)
asked in the interview with them is we (115:07 - 115:11)
asked them what they&#39;re how often they (115:09 - 115:13)
planned it and they we&#39;re like we we (115:11 - 115:14)
don&#39;t know (115:13 - 115:16)
yet which is like a fair answer like we (115:14 - 115:18)
don&#39;t know how fast yeah people will (115:16 - 115:20)
want to (115:18 - 115:22)
consume which is probably part of the (115:20 - 115:25)
reason they&#39;ve done on this this beta um (115:22 - 115:27)
The Early Access orever you want to call (115:25 - 115:29)
it because they can see New Zealand (115:27 - 115:32)
people um although as we all know this (115:29 - 115:33)
is probably going to be quite heavily (115:32 - 115:37)
weighted towards uh enthusiastic people (115:33 - 115:39)
should we say with the (115:37 - 115:42)
vpns yeah who are more likely than than (115:39 - 115:44)
the general populace to (115:42 - 115:46)
purchase if only if only express VPN (115:44 - 115:49)
knew that they could have that would (115:46 - 115:51)
have been the time to advertise on this (115:49 - 115:53)
show (115:51 - 115:55)
I don&#39;t think I think their contract (115:53 - 115:57)
with us ended a little bit (115:55 - 115:59)
ago that was their fault not (115:57 - 116:01)
ours they could have taken advantage of (115:59 - 116:05)
the the TCG boom well I do know that (116:01 - 116:08)
there were multiple free vpns that just (116:05 - 116:11)
di their New Zealand servers just died (116:08 - 116:12)
they just weren&#39;t working because too (116:11 - 116:14)
many people were trying to connect to (116:12 - 116:15)
them amazing because who&#39;s who&#39;s (116:14 - 116:18)
connecting to New Zealand in a VPN (116:15 - 116:20)
normally not very many people yeah yeah (116:18 - 116:23)
yeah yeah only for Pokemon that&#39;s that&#39;s (116:20 - 116:24)
definitely not true but it sure seems (116:23 - 116:28)
like it sometimes yeah so anyways we (116:24 - 116:30)
will be back next week uh I&#39;m sure it (116:28 - 116:34)
will be a TCG pocket heavy episode we (116:30 - 116:36)
are recording this on Sunday so there (116:34 - 116:39)
might be I don&#39;t know if they would (116:36 - 116:41)
announce a sevenstar raid tonight (116:39 - 116:43)
knowing that there&#39;s an event this week (116:41 - 116:46)
so I don&#39;t think so I don&#39;t think so I (116:43 - 116:48)
don&#39;t think so um I don&#39;t think there&#39;ll (116:46 - 116:50)
be a sevenstar raid but of course (116:48 - 116:51)
they&#39;re going to they&#39;re going to do it (116:50 - 116:52)
now that we&#39;ve said that we don&#39;t think (116:51 - 116:53)
that&#39;s true that&#39;s true they got two (116:52 - 116:56)
left they got feraligator and tort Tera (116:53 - 116:58)
I think are left and then they&#39;re done (116:56 - 117:02)
with starters at least one November one (116:58 - 117:02)
December uh and we for sure know like (117:03 - 117:07)
there&#39;s no way that Eevee is seven star (117:05 - 117:08)
Eevee is for sure coming back for (117:07 - 117:09)
