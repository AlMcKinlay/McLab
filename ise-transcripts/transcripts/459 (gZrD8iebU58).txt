a long possibly long enough if i say (1:51 - 1:54)
it's (1:54 - 1:57)
long that means maybe how is it going to (1:54 - 1:58)
be long because sometimes it's longer (1:57 - 2:00)

news (2:09 - 2:11)
we might even not have time to talk (2:11 - 2:16)
about pokemon snap (2:13 - 2:18)
i'm just kidding there's no there's no (2:16 - 2:20)
25th well there was (2:18 - 2:23)
there was some news but well whatever (2:20 - 2:25)

way there is a meow (2:25 - 2:30)
event yeah (2:27 - 2:32)
which you were all salty about i wasn't (2:30 - 2:33)
salty (2:32 - 2:36)
you jumped early i just got in and next (2:33 - 2:37)
thing i know (2:36 - 2:39)
you're up playing snap and then i go to (2:37 - 2:40)
my first den (2:39 - 2:42)
you don't even wait you just like well (2:40 - 2:43)
it's done i didn't know you were doing (2:42 - 2:44)
the done (2:43 - 2:46)
what i was in your chat you're like (2:44 - 2:48)
let's switch over so i switched over (2:46 - 2:51)
when i say let's switch over it's it's (2:48 - 2:53)
me saying i'm switching over and (2:51 - 2:54)
understanding that twitch chat is doing (2:53 - 2:55)
nothing (2:54 - 2:57)
but what they were doing oh so you're (2:55 - 2:58)
just lumping me (2:57 - 3:01)
in when i said let's switch over i (2:58 - 3:02)
didn't know you were actively switching (3:01 - 3:03)
over (3:02 - 3:05)
yeah well i switched over and now i have (3:03 - 3:08)
three shiny gold cats (3:05 - 3:11)
let's okay play the news music we're (3:08 - 3:13)
here (3:11 - 3:13)
there people actually knew the name of (3:14 - 3:19)
that file (3:17 - 3:21)
their minds would be blown because i (3:19 - 3:24)
have it and i know what it's called (3:21 - 3:27)
um make them a ringtone (3:24 - 3:29)
because of golden week sword and shield (3:27 - 3:30)
had a shiny (3:29 - 3:33)
gallerian meowth event this weekend and (3:30 - 3:34)
what's golden week (3:33 - 3:37)
golden week is where something happens (3:34 - 3:38)
in persona 5 (3:37 - 3:40)
and then monster hunter comes out and (3:38 - 3:41)
then no one (3:40 - 3:43)
goes to work and then they all celebrate (3:41 - 3:47)
i believe (3:43 - 3:51)
this is the worst explanation (3:47 - 3:53)
i have ever heard golden week is the (3:51 - 3:55)
week where if you are (3:53 - 3:58)
a fan of japanese animation also known (3:55 - 3:58)
as (3:58 - 4:01)
anime uh there will be no episodes (3:58 - 4:03)
that's also true (4:01 - 4:05)
oh wait really that's true as well one (4:03 - 4:06)
hundred percent (4:05 - 4:08)
you i was shocked that there was a new (4:06 - 4:12)
episode of my hero this week because (4:08 - 4:14)
they got that they have that in the (4:12 - 4:15)
hopper they just have to press the (4:14 - 4:16)
button go (4:15 - 4:18)
i was told you never traveled to japan (4:16 - 4:19)
during the golden week because you'll (4:18 - 4:21)
never get anything (4:19 - 4:22)
you won't be able to see much wow (4:21 - 4:24)
everyone's like (4:22 - 4:25)
because all the japanese folks are (4:24 - 4:28)
traveling they're all crowded (4:25 - 4:30)
so what can you actually give an actual (4:28 - 4:33)
definition of what golden week is (4:30 - 4:37)
no i don't know no you even know (4:33 - 4:39)
i just i just gave it no you didn't you (4:37 - 4:41)
said it's golden and people don't do (4:39 - 4:42)
things (4:41 - 4:45)
yeah go there okay (4:42 - 4:46)
fill in the blank golden week is the (4:45 - 4:48)
collection of pokemon (4:46 - 4:52)
no will i (4:48 - 4:56)
uh i have no idea i didn't (4:52 - 4:59)
have any national holidays within seven (4:56 - 5:00)
days (4:59 - 5:03)
four four (5:00 - 5:06)
in combination with well-placed weekends (5:03 - 5:07)
the golden week becomes one of the (5:06 - 5:10)
of japan's three busiest holiday seasons (5:07 - 5:13)
besides new year's and the obon week (5:10 - 5:15)
ooh i don't know what obon is but that (5:13 - 5:18)
sounds cool yeah it does (5:15 - 5:18)
to be fair the pokemon company doesn't (5:19 - 5:23)
get (5:23 - 5:26)
to pick when golden week is so to be (5:23 - 5:27)
like (5:26 - 5:30)
shiny meals to celebrate golden week to (5:27 - 5:32)
be fair (5:30 - 5:36)
they knew when this was years in advance (5:32 - 5:39)
true it's like saying oh i didn't know (5:36 - 5:39)
that (5:39 - 5:45)
the 25th of december was christmas (5:39 - 5:45)
who knew is it on the 25th of every year (5:45 - 5:53)
so they decided to do shiny gulerian (5:50 - 5:54)
meowth (5:53 - 5:57)
and then gigantomax mouth and then (5:54 - 5:58)
regular meowth (5:57 - 6:02)
and then alolan meowth for golden week (5:58 - 6:04)
in pokemon sword and shield which is the (6:02 - 6:06)
problem we keep having (6:04 - 6:09)
time and time and time again where they (6:06 - 6:10)
like to have (6:09 - 6:12)
a million events and also release a (6:10 - 6:14)
brand new game (6:12 - 6:17)
at least with pokemon go they were like (6:14 - 6:18)
shiny smeargle (6:17 - 6:20)
you get 15 pictures a day it's not that (6:18 - 6:22)
time consuming (6:20 - 6:25)
you can't keep like there's a threshold (6:22 - 6:27)
once you get to 15 you're kind of done (6:25 - 6:28)
you can't get like a sword and shield (6:27 - 6:30)
you can just keep playing until (6:28 - 6:32)
you get it and sometimes that could be (6:30 - 6:33)
several hours (6:32 - 6:37)
i mean and the pokemon go one was tied (6:33 - 6:39)
to pokemon snap i mean the reason that (6:37 - 6:42)
we're having the pokemon go event is to (6:39 - 6:44)
celebrate the release of pokemon the new (6:42 - 6:48)
pokemon snap (6:44 - 6:53)
i think again the problem here is like (6:48 - 6:56)
they always do thursday to friday sunday (6:53 - 6:56)
but they could have (6:56 - 6:58)
pushed it up a little earlier i don't (6:56 - 6:59)
get why they just didn't like (6:58 - 7:01)
hey started on tuesday give us like a (6:59 - 7:03)
little head start because with pokemon (7:01 - 7:03)
snap (7:03 - 7:06)
i knew sorry with pokemon go i knew (7:03 - 7:08)
pokemon snap was coming out and i (7:06 - 7:10)
normally when a new pokemon game comes (7:08 - 7:12)
out i do long hours on twitch (7:10 - 7:15)
which is me being like i'm i need to hit (7:12 - 7:17)
a pokestop and i need to catch a pokemon (7:15 - 7:19)
and i need to do my dailies before i sit (7:17 - 7:20)
down to stream (7:19 - 7:22)
because i'm going till midnight but the (7:20 - 7:25)
little quest line they did (7:22 - 7:28)
came out on thursday (7:25 - 7:28)
right yeah thursday they'll like (7:28 - 7:34)
take a snapshot of a ground pokemon use (7:31 - 7:36)
seven berries (7:34 - 7:38)
like i did that on thursday when i was (7:36 - 7:40)
running my errands (7:38 - 7:44)
and also sick and then (7:40 - 7:48)
when friday came i was the quest line (7:44 - 7:49)
was done (7:48 - 7:52)
no no you finished the quest line yeah (7:49 - 7:54)
those of us who have not even started it (7:52 - 7:55)
it was not done (7:54 - 7:59)
it's not done and it won't get done (7:55 - 7:59)
to take a picture of is it the first tab (8:00 - 8:03)
or is that the (8:02 - 8:08)
yeah today today tab i think it ends (8:03 - 8:08)
tonight (8:11 - 8:16)
let's talk about pokemon what there's no (8:12 - 8:18)
other news (8:16 - 8:22)
there's got to be something buddy (8:18 - 8:25)
look it is the 25th anniversary (8:22 - 8:28)
i mean there isn't even there's like one (8:25 - 8:29)
thing to cover (8:28 - 8:31)
for masters and there's one thing to (8:29 - 8:33)
cover for go (8:31 - 8:35)
we're gonna just jump into the main (8:33 - 8:39)
event do you not know how to tease (8:35 - 8:41)
people (8:39 - 8:44)
yeah sometimes i make them listen i (8:41 - 8:46)
don't know if they made it this part of (8:44 - 8:47)
the episode they're still listening (8:46 - 8:51)
i they added (8:47 - 8:54)
ryhan to pokemon snap they did my (8:51 - 8:57)
pokemon fight me and pokemon (8:54 - 9:00)
i mean he made photobomb in (8:57 - 9:04)
go you don't know or snap maybe (9:00 - 9:07)
there there was a japanese survey that (9:04 - 9:09)
went out that like ranked all the (9:07 - 9:11)
pokemon masters sought after characters (9:09 - 9:13)
but i wanna i wanna (9:11 - 9:15)
i really do wanna talk about that (9:13 - 9:16)
because even if you don't like pokemon (9:15 - 9:17)
masters (9:16 - 9:19)
it's a very interesting like you won't (9:17 - 9:23)
believe who came in third place (9:19 - 9:25)
but we'll save that for next week (9:23 - 9:27)
because like (9:25 - 9:28)
because we got pokemon snap and i i (9:27 - 9:29)
don't want to do that in disservice (9:28 - 9:31)
because i think that survey was really (9:29 - 9:32)
interesting (9:31 - 9:34)
and fun um well you're gonna have to (9:32 - 9:36)
send it to me again because i'll close (9:34 - 9:39)
that tab and not look at it (9:36 - 9:41)
spoiler milo didn't make top 15. that's (9:39 - 9:43)
right don't even don't even (9:41 - 9:46)
so mad (9:43 - 9:46)
so the actual shocking news of the 25th (9:47 - 9:51)
anniversary (9:50 - 9:55)
is that greg bought pokemon snap i did (9:51 - 9:58)
i poke him on snap that that is the (9:55 - 10:00)
that is the show for one reason and one (9:58 - 10:01)
reason only (10:00 - 10:05)
because you had to let a mouse out (10:01 - 10:08)
what that's that's all i saw (10:05 - 10:10)
pikachu nah i don't think it was an (10:08 - 10:13)
electric mouse (10:10 - 10:13)
i mean literally what i saw was yes i (10:13 - 10:18)
have to go release a mouse i'm buying (10:16 - 10:18)
pokemon (10:18 - 10:21)
snap this is the message i said and i (10:18 - 10:23)
will tell you how those two things are (10:21 - 10:24)
related (10:23 - 10:27)
so i was watching as i as i had said i (10:24 - 10:28)
would watch the stream (10:27 - 10:31)
and see if pokemon snap looked (10:28 - 10:34)
fun i also watched steve's stream (10:31 - 10:36)
it looked fun enough steve bragging (10:34 - 10:38)
about his (10:36 - 10:41)
pictures getting sweet medals two sweets (10:38 - 10:44)
was more than enough to maybe like that (10:41 - 10:47)
uh what was it the (10:44 - 10:50)
the meganium was it meganium got like (10:47 - 10:54)
65 suites not just two yeah but him (10:50 - 10:55)
talking about that and being like i'm (10:54 - 10:57)
gonna do this (10:55 - 10:59)
spurred the competition in me and like (10:57 - 11:00)
oh i'm gonna show this dude (10:59 - 11:04)
for sure but i had no plans to leave the (11:00 - 11:05)
house (11:04 - 11:09)
but our live mouse trap suddenly had a (11:05 - 11:10)
mouse in it (11:09 - 11:12)
which meant i had to go take it to its (11:10 - 11:14)
new relocation center somewhere out in (11:12 - 11:16)
the wilderness which meant i had to (11:14 - 11:17)
leave the home (11:16 - 11:19)
is that because you had your life (11:17 - 11:20)
pokemon tricks (11:19 - 11:22)
in the basement and then the mouse (11:20 - 11:24)
figured out the tricks was down there (11:22 - 11:24)
because you were trying you (11:24 - 11:27)
didn't get the box on amazon i'm (11:24 - 11:28)
confused by the phrase (11:27 - 11:30)
live mouse trap what would be the (11:28 - 11:32)
alternative (11:30 - 11:36)
a kill mouse trap oh i prefer that (11:32 - 11:39)
yeah no we don't do that so (11:36 - 11:41)
it came to the point where i was sitting (11:39 - 11:42)
here and i could hear that (11:41 - 11:44)
there was something in the mousetrap and (11:42 - 11:45)
i'm like well i have to leave (11:44 - 11:48)
wait actual real talk yeah is the live (11:45 - 11:51)
one more expensive than the kill one (11:48 - 11:54)
no i mean they're more expensive in that (11:51 - 11:56)
you make the purchase (11:54 - 12:00)
of the trap once but they're reusable (11:56 - 12:04)
so it's like the one that snaps not (12:00 - 12:04)
reusable (12:04 - 12:07)
no because it tends to get pretty stinky (12:04 - 12:09)
full of mouse smell and all the mice are (12:07 - 12:10)
like oh that's where my stock (12:09 - 12:13)
so we're gonna avoid it i guess that (12:10 - 12:15)
makes sense (12:13 - 12:19)
uh and some of them break uh so (12:15 - 12:21)
and plus look the mouse didn't know it (12:19 - 12:23)
was breaking into my house per se (12:21 - 12:26)
i don't whatever so you saved a mouse (12:23 - 12:28)
though you're here i saved a mouse (12:26 - 12:30)
and i had to go release it into the wild (12:28 - 12:32)
which is really basically saying i kill (12:30 - 12:33)
the mouse through natural means because (12:32 - 12:36)
the bird's gonna eat it (12:33 - 12:36)
but (12:37 - 12:42)
i had to leave the house we didn't take (12:39 - 12:43)
it to the mouse (12:42 - 12:45)
sanctuary there's no mouth sanctuary but (12:43 - 12:46)
i did (12:45 - 12:50)
this wait i have just visualized (12:46 - 12:53)
greg the great i want to say (12:50 - 12:55)
humanitarian but that doesn't apply to (12:53 - 12:56)
mice (12:55 - 12:59)
so mouseketeer greg the great (12:56 - 13:01)
mouseketeer is like (12:59 - 13:04)
disney's gonna sue us now a live (13:01 - 13:06)
mousetrap so that there is no (13:04 - 13:09)
mouse death in my house and i am going (13:06 - 13:10)
to take you precious (13:09 - 13:14)
life that i have now saved to (13:10 - 13:17)
the local snake pit and dump you in (13:14 - 13:20)
i mean there are there aren't snakes in (13:17 - 13:21)
the park (13:20 - 13:23)
that i know of i took it to the park (13:21 - 13:25)
there are a lot more birds in the park (13:23 - 13:26)
and we do have a lot of owls (13:25 - 13:30)
so look after i'm done at night mouse (13:26 - 13:31)
you're on your own (13:30 - 13:33)
but because the mouse because i had to (13:31 - 13:34)
get into the car (13:33 - 13:36)
and drive to release that mouse i was (13:34 - 13:38)
like well i might as well go to target (13:36 - 13:41)
and pick up snap so i did (13:38 - 13:44)
this is how i ended up buying pokemon (13:41 - 13:45)
snap (13:44 - 13:47)
because i caught a mouse right now i now (13:45 - 13:48)
understand (13:47 - 13:52)
your your reasoning is (13:48 - 13:54)
similar to what i would use if the mouse (13:52 - 13:57)
had not been caught i would not (13:54 - 14:04)
think this is really weird okay hold on (13:57 - 14:04)
[Music] (14:04 - 14:10)
gosh there's so there's so much so for (14:07 - 14:12)
for the sake of this pokemon snap (14:10 - 14:14)
conversation (14:12 - 14:17)
there is a story to pokemon snap we (14:14 - 14:17)
won't (14:17 - 14:21)
be talking about the story (14:17 - 14:24)
one because i didn't finish the story (14:21 - 14:26)
two because i'm sure some of you guys (14:24 - 14:30)
didn't finish the story three because (14:26 - 14:32)
some there might be debate whether you (14:30 - 14:35)
would even classify it as a story (14:32 - 14:35)
um and uh (14:36 - 14:42)
if you're i feel like for the sake of (14:39 - 14:44)
the conversation (14:42 - 14:47)
i i have not unlocked all 200 some (14:44 - 14:49)
pokemon we do know there's 200 some (14:47 - 14:50)
pokemon because (14:49 - 14:52)
that's what they said in an interview (14:50 - 14:54)
but (14:52 - 14:54)
i feel like all pokemon are fair game (14:54 - 14:59)
except maybe (14:57 - 15:01)
we won't spoil the bosses besides (14:59 - 15:03)
meganium everyone knows meganium is the (15:01 - 15:04)
first like (15:03 - 15:05)
okay so you're calling that the bus sure (15:04 - 15:07)
yeah how are their bosses in a (15:05 - 15:10)
take pictures game (15:07 - 15:12)
well i can i i guess you haven't gotten (15:10 - 15:14)
to the ganium boss right i i've (15:12 - 15:15)
literally played one (15:14 - 15:18)
minute's worth of pokemon showed up at (15:15 - 15:20)
the front door (15:18 - 15:22)
and then we'll we'll ignore legendaries (15:20 - 15:23)
because i know there are legendaries in (15:22 - 15:25)
the game so we'll ignore this (15:23 - 15:27)
but if it's if it's a basic pokemon dex (15:25 - 15:29)
filler (15:27 - 15:32)
if you can put it from your hand out on (15:29 - 15:33)
the bench (15:32 - 15:37)
without evolving it it's fair game (15:33 - 15:37)
so with that being said (15:37 - 15:43)
for those that didn't know pokemon snap (15:41 - 15:44)
is was made by (15:43 - 15:46)
bandai namco namco bandai whichever (15:44 - 15:48)
order you want to pick (15:46 - 15:51)
they were the people who made pokken (15:48 - 15:52)
official order (15:51 - 15:55)
yeah there i think it's namco bandai i (15:52 - 15:57)
think it's just namco bandai yes (15:55 - 15:59)
uh they were the people who made pokken (15:57 - 16:01)
tournament and pokken tournament (15:59 - 16:04)
dx they also worked with creatures to (16:01 - 16:06)
make shadow mewtwo shadow mewtwo (16:04 - 16:07)
according to their website it's (16:06 - 16:10)
bandai namco (16:07 - 16:10)
so they they made this came out (16:12 - 16:19)
for weeks on this show myself (16:16 - 16:23)
and i would probably say greg we're like (16:19 - 16:24)
i don't think this is gonna be a sixty (16:23 - 16:26)
dollar game (16:24 - 16:29)
and i still think that really no no you (16:26 - 16:31)
don't think it should be asic we we have (16:29 - 16:34)
no it is a sixty dollar game i know it's (16:31 - 16:36)
a sixty dollar game (16:34 - 16:41)
so the i (16:36 - 16:44)
i'm about 20 hours into pokemon snap (16:41 - 16:47)
right now and prior to this conversation (16:44 - 16:47)
i (16:47 - 16:49)
i thought that i would be coming into (16:47 - 16:51)
this week's podcast being like well (16:49 - 16:54)
uh six hours later i beat pokemon snap (16:51 - 16:57)
but i'm 20 hours in um about halfway (16:54 - 16:59)
through the pokedex i have one million (16:57 - 17:01)
photo score (16:59 - 17:03)
what's your max photo score you can get (17:01 - 17:05)
no one million is like all your photos (17:03 - 17:08)
combined into the overall score because (17:05 - 17:10)
then there's the leaderboard of like (17:08 - 17:11)
it's kind of how you can tell how far (17:10 - 17:13)
somebody is you'd be like oh that person (17:11 - 17:14)
has half a million so they're probably (17:13 - 17:15)
like (17:14 - 17:17)
right before the volcano level or this (17:15 - 17:20)
person has like two million so they're (17:17 - 17:21)
like probably close to everything (17:20 - 17:24)
unlocked and ready to go (17:21 - 17:26)
so i'm 20 hours in i have a one million (17:24 - 17:29)
photo score (17:26 - 17:32)
and i'm very glad that earlier this week (17:29 - 17:32)
i played through (17:32 - 17:35)
the original pokemon snap which (17:32 - 17:38)
to be fair i played a lot as a kid so (17:35 - 17:40)
i'm pretty familiar with where the (17:38 - 17:43)
pokemon were there's 63 pokemon in that (17:40 - 17:44)
game there was supposed to be 64 pokemon (17:43 - 17:46)
in the game atkins didn't work he (17:44 - 17:49)
they had to cut him last minute so 63 (17:46 - 17:51)
and i was able to play through (17:49 - 17:54)
all of the first pokemon snap and pretty (17:51 - 17:55)
much 100 (17:54 - 17:58)
the game get all 63 pokemon in about (17:55 - 17:59)
four hours (17:58 - 18:01)
and i suppose maybe if you've never (17:59 - 18:04)
played the new the original pokemon snap (18:01 - 18:06)
maybe it would take like seven or eight (18:04 - 18:07)
hours (18:06 - 18:10)
there's (18:07 - 18:10)
maybe five i mean like i don't know i (18:11 - 18:15)
feel like if you get stumped somewhere (18:14 - 18:17)
you look up a guide as a kid (18:15 - 18:19)
i didn't have an internet and my parents (18:17 - 18:21)
wouldn't buy me a guidebook so (18:19 - 18:22)
it was a lot of like figuring out where (18:21 - 18:24)
that last pokemon was (18:22 - 18:27)
but there's a there's a pretty stark (18:24 - 18:29)
difference between the games (18:27 - 18:32)
i'm curious though at what point (18:29 - 18:35)
greg decided that it was worth buying (18:32 - 18:36)
because i think you were in stream for (18:35 - 18:39)
maybe like three or four hours (18:36 - 18:42)
but was there like a certain point where (18:39 - 18:43)
you were like i told you when you posted (18:42 - 18:45)
your picture we're getting sweet medals (18:43 - 18:47)
oh the competitive thing the competitive (18:45 - 18:49)
aspect i was like i'm gonna you know (18:47 - 18:52)
shove this into this dude's face yeah i (18:49 - 18:54)
am so big (18:52 - 18:57)
i would say right i very similarly (18:54 - 19:00)
happy birthday tan growth yep right (18:57 - 19:01)
there it's like that was it i (19:00 - 19:04)
am the bow tie in the confetti and i was (19:01 - 19:07)
like i gotta get this game (19:04 - 19:10)
uh actually the the fact that it was (19:07 - 19:13)
not just not just like (19:10 - 19:14)
take the pictures out and post them on (19:13 - 19:16)
twitter and whatever but there was like (19:14 - 19:17)
an (19:16 - 19:19)
internal see how your friends are doing (19:17 - 19:21)
see how your friend's shots (19:19 - 19:24)
are that tipped me into the (19:21 - 19:27)
okay i'm more interested in this game (19:24 - 19:29)
uh and then the mouse tipped me over (19:27 - 19:32)
into finally buying it (19:29 - 19:34)
uh but it was the fact that there was a (19:32 - 19:35)
built in (19:34 - 19:38)
internal i can see how my friends are (19:35 - 19:39)
progressing (19:38 - 19:41)
also that they did something very clever (19:39 - 19:43)
with how they post pictures (19:41 - 19:45)
like there's a lot of thought put into (19:43 - 19:47)
the online component which is a rarity (19:45 - 19:49)
for a nintendo game (19:47 - 19:53)
um and that that (19:49 - 19:56)
pushed me into okay there's enough here (19:53 - 19:58)
that i could find (19:56 - 20:01)
enjoyment i still i still have a number (19:58 - 20:02)
of complaints (20:01 - 20:06)
about the game but overall uh (20:02 - 20:10)
that was sort of like okay i can this (20:06 - 20:10)
it looks pretty which is always a big (20:10 - 20:14)
thing yeah the graphics are real nice (20:12 - 20:17)
uh and there's an online component so (20:14 - 20:18)
you can see how my friends are doing and (20:17 - 20:19)
i can see (20:18 - 20:23)
the shots that they're taking and (20:19 - 20:23)
there are enough pokemon that i like (20:24 - 20:30)
that i've seen so far that i would like (20:28 - 20:32)
to take pictures of them (20:30 - 20:35)
there there is some some ones that i (20:32 - 20:37)
have not found and i don't think i will (20:35 - 20:39)
found and i'm mad about it (20:37 - 20:40)
i mean you'll find them eventually you (20:39 - 20:42)
just keep trying yeah i keep (20:40 - 20:45)
still trying (20:42 - 20:45)
well how's your first level experience (20:45 - 20:49)
no no i have not gotten a first level (20:48 - 20:51)
i've played one minutes (20:49 - 20:54)
work at the front door i found out that (20:51 - 20:55)
i am in the lentil region (20:54 - 20:58)
there's a person named rita there who i (20:55 - 21:00)
didn't see in your stream at all so rita (20:58 - 21:00)
must go (21:00 - 21:03)
someplace else at some point pops in and (21:00 - 21:03)
out (21:03 - 21:07)
uh they introduce more characters which (21:03 - 21:10)
i don't know if that benefits the game (21:07 - 21:10)
but (21:10 - 21:14)
they exist i um i yeah so i customized (21:10 - 21:17)
did my character customization (21:14 - 21:19)
yeah uh oh i'm glad you brought that up (21:17 - 21:21)
i mean it's not that big of a deal (21:19 - 21:22)
and i was like in the in the trailers (21:21 - 21:24)
they were like here here's your (21:22 - 21:26)
standard white boy here's your white (21:24 - 21:27)
girl (21:26 - 21:29)
and i know that's important to people of (21:27 - 21:31)
color to have (21:29 - 21:33)
not white and they never showed that in (21:31 - 21:35)
any of the trailers (21:33 - 21:37)
but they but i was like well they did (21:35 - 21:38)
poke and tournament you could be black (21:37 - 21:40)
in pokemon tournament or you can (21:38 - 21:42)
um you know have a little color to your (21:40 - 21:44)
skin but there are so (21:42 - 21:47)
many like little things that i saw right (21:44 - 21:49)
away from playing pokken tournament that (21:47 - 21:49)
they (21:49 - 21:52)
just brought over copy and pasted over (21:49 - 21:53)
which is like (21:52 - 21:54)
a good good copy page am i getting hats (21:53 - 21:57)
and scarves is this what you're telling (21:54 - 21:57)
me (21:57 - 21:59)
no that would have been really great (21:57 - 22:00)
yeah there's no like fully (21:59 - 22:01)
like you pick your what your character (22:00 - 22:04)
looks like and that's kind of it no (22:01 - 22:05)
no hats or scarfs although that would (22:04 - 22:08)
have been cool yeah so i know we're in (22:05 - 22:09)
the lentil region (22:08 - 22:14)
and the island we're on where professor (22:09 - 22:18)
mirror secretly mirror bee (22:14 - 22:21)
big disappointment on my uh that they (22:18 - 22:22)
chose that but whatever (22:21 - 22:25)
uh those cameras have mirrors is (22:22 - 22:29)
yes but hi fyi (22:25 - 22:31)
in the original pokemon snap the (22:29 - 22:33)
professor was professor oak (22:31 - 22:35)
yeah that dude doesn't know how to grade (22:33 - 22:36)
a photo to save his life it doesn't (22:35 - 22:38)
matter i can argue that the current dude (22:36 - 22:39)
doesn't know how to degrade a photo (22:38 - 22:39)
either (22:39 - 22:43)
could we not have had the current (22:39 - 22:45)
a current pokemon professor why did we (22:43 - 22:47)
have to create a new pokemon professor (22:45 - 22:50)
and then do historic revision of (22:47 - 22:51)
nobody's ever (22:50 - 22:54)
done this kind of a thing before well (22:51 - 22:55)
i'm sorry (22:54 - 22:57)
21 years ago professor oak was out on (22:55 - 22:58)
this mission (22:57 - 23:01)
and oh wait no this hundred-year-old (22:58 - 23:02)
explorer in this (23:01 - 23:04)
book i i think it oh yeah captain vince (23:02 - 23:05)
i think you thought i'd (23:04 - 23:07)
play this game for one minute and it's (23:05 - 23:09)
already got me aggregated (23:07 - 23:11)
i think he's talking about not not the i (23:09 - 23:13)
think he's like no one's ever taken (23:11 - 23:15)
photos before pokemon i think he's (23:13 - 23:16)
saying no one has ever like (23:15 - 23:18)
figured out what is causing the (23:16 - 23:20)
illuminati no no no no no there was no (23:18 - 23:20)
mention (23:20 - 23:23)
they literally were just like nobody has (23:20 - 23:25)
done this kind of exploration before (23:23 - 23:28)
period yeah because okay so within an (23:25 - 23:30)
hour of the game todd shows up from the (23:28 - 23:31)
first one (23:30 - 23:33)
and so this is why rita doesn't come (23:31 - 23:34)
like rita is less (23:33 - 23:37)
used because todd who is all grown up (23:34 - 23:38)
they aged him like (23:37 - 23:40)
i don't know i don't know how old he was (23:38 - 23:42)
supposed to be in the first one (23:40 - 23:44)
but he's he's clearly an adult and he (23:42 - 23:45)
comes (23:44 - 23:47)
and then he is like wow you're a great (23:45 - 23:48)
photographer professor (23:47 - 23:50)
is doing a great job so it's they're (23:48 - 23:52)
they're not there's (23:50 - 23:54)
i'm i'm almost positive they're (23:52 - 23:55)
referring to the illuminati thing (23:54 - 23:56)
because he (23:55 - 23:58)
because todd also seems confused about (23:56 - 23:59)
the illuminati thing but they talk about (23:58 - 24:00)
how like oh (23:59 - 24:03)
todd did this and he took photos and he (24:00 - 24:04)
has a (24:03 - 24:08)
mentor for our listeners who (24:04 - 24:11)
actually read and or listen um it's (24:08 - 24:12)
illumina (24:11 - 24:14)
it's not illuminati it's not illuminati (24:12 - 24:16)
illuminati (24:14 - 24:18)
the secret society do exist so that that (24:16 - 24:19)
was that was a pretty (24:18 - 24:22)
big surprise that todd is there i don't (24:19 - 24:23)
think they i don't think that's how (24:22 - 24:25)
is that a surprise at all it's as big as (24:23 - 24:27)
the surprises everybody's making it out (24:25 - 24:27)
to me (24:27 - 24:29)
i never expected the character that (24:27 - 24:31)
appeared in the other version of this (24:29 - 24:33)
here's like here's a major character (24:31 - 24:34)
from the first game (24:33 - 24:36)
there was one character from the first (24:34 - 24:38)
game that wasn't professor oak who was (24:36 - 24:42)
also in the anime who would have guessed (24:38 - 24:44)
that he was in like three episodes at (24:42 - 24:46)
the end no no no no but if they had put (24:44 - 24:48)
tracy in this game yeah (24:46 - 24:50)
that would have that would have been (24:48 - 24:51)
like why are you (24:50 - 24:55)
pictured dude pokemon (24:51 - 24:58)
legends there is there's like a (24:55 - 25:00)
phenomenon right where people remember (24:58 - 25:02)
movies that don't exist (25:00 - 25:04)
isn't there like some shazam phenomenon (25:02 - 25:05)
where people (25:04 - 25:08)
remember that being wrong most famous is (25:05 - 25:09)
the berenstain bears (25:08 - 25:12)
oh yeah that's one of them but uh no uh (25:09 - 25:14)
it's the mandela effect because (25:12 - 25:16)
the nelson mandela one is the most (25:14 - 25:18)
famous one (25:16 - 25:21)
i don't know what that is nelson mandela (25:18 - 25:24)
dove you don't know what the effect is (25:21 - 25:26)
the recording now (25:24 - 25:30)
you know who nelson mandela is i do (25:26 - 25:34)
okay i don't know we have to move on (25:30 - 25:36)
the point we're gonna i'm gonna text (25:34 - 25:39)
irene right now (25:36 - 25:39)
the point is that i i (25:40 - 25:46)
they're constantly over the weekend (25:43 - 25:49)
people were confusing maybe it's just my (25:46 - 25:50)
twitch audience (25:49 - 25:53)
uh sorry twitch tracy sketchit (25:50 - 25:57)
and todd snap like there was like a (25:53 - 25:58)
memory blur (25:57 - 26:01)
where people were like oh yeah these are (25:58 - 26:01)
actually (26:01 - 26:04)
two different characters and i had to be (26:01 - 26:06)
like no tracy (26:04 - 26:08)
is not a photographer he is it's tracy (26:06 - 26:11)
sketch it he (26:08 - 26:14)
draws and then todd is well (26:11 - 26:16)
todd was in pokemon snap which you all (26:14 - 26:18)
remember but he wasn't (26:16 - 26:19)
he was only in like three episodes the (26:18 - 26:22)
anime he (26:19 - 26:22)
but yeah there was i people were like oh (26:22 - 26:26)
yeah they were totally two different (26:24 - 26:27)
characters (26:26 - 26:30)
although maybe they had like (26:27 - 26:34)
similar energy i mean they did (26:30 - 26:36)
they were both artistic i can explain to (26:34 - 26:37)
you 100 (26:36 - 26:41)
what it is it's folks who don't know (26:37 - 26:44)
who don't use adobe products don't (26:41 - 26:45)
understand the difference (26:44 - 26:50)
between illustrator and photoshop (26:45 - 26:52)
and to them it's like they both make (26:50 - 26:54)
pictures (26:52 - 26:57)
that's true so what is (26:54 - 26:58)
the difference between that i know the (26:57 - 27:00)
difference between illustrator photoshop (26:58 - 27:03)
uh one does ray tracing and the other (27:00 - 27:04)
does (27:03 - 27:06)
uh something with the pixels point point (27:04 - 27:07)
point vector no (27:06 - 27:09)
photo illustrator does vector yeah there (27:07 - 27:11)
you go (27:09 - 27:11)
doesn't matter they both do pictures (27:12 - 27:17)
they might as well be the same person (27:14 - 27:20)
uh i think todd being there is good i (27:17 - 27:21)
don't have any problems with professor (27:20 - 27:22)
mir (27:21 - 27:24)
uh rita is like a very cute character um (27:22 - 27:25)
she comes and goes (27:24 - 27:27)
but they do this this is the worst part (27:25 - 27:28)
of the game we're just gonna get the (27:27 - 27:30)
worst part of the game out of the way (27:28 - 27:33)
they introduced this beyblade character (27:30 - 27:36)
named billy or johnny or (27:33 - 27:40)
what what is his name greg charles bill (27:36 - 27:43)
phil is it's your is it your rival yeah (27:40 - 27:46)
they they introduce a rival and they do (27:43 - 27:47)
it really cleverly (27:46 - 27:50)
they like they have the rival come up (27:47 - 27:51)
he's like (27:50 - 27:55)
let it rip and he is very excited to (27:51 - 27:56)
like (27:55 - 28:00)
combat you in photography and then (27:56 - 28:03)
and then todd and then he (28:00 - 28:05)
yells at you he's like no todd's my (28:03 - 28:07)
mentor stop talking to todd (28:05 - 28:09)
and then todd's like you have to give (28:07 - 28:10)
your photo badge back (28:09 - 28:12)
because you're not a real photographer (28:10 - 28:14)
yet so like he (28:12 - 28:16)
he comes off very strong he's like let (28:14 - 28:17)
it rip wait (28:16 - 28:20)
phil has to give his photo badge back no (28:17 - 28:23)
phil has failed us back (28:20 - 28:24)
so that's like the most clean that's (28:23 - 28:26)
like the most clever part is like phil's (28:24 - 28:27)
very (28:26 - 28:29)
he he's like aggressively excited to (28:27 - 28:31)
combat you in photography (28:29 - 28:33)
he doesn't want you talking to todd (28:31 - 28:34)
because todd's his mentor (28:33 - 28:36)
and then he's like a fake photographer (28:34 - 28:38)
because he's just borrowing the (28:36 - 28:39)
photography medal that you get after (28:38 - 28:41)
like taking three pictures in the world (28:39 - 28:43)
and then mirrors like here's your (28:41 - 28:45)
photography medal um (28:43 - 28:47)
and then the entire rest of the game (28:45 - 28:50)
this dude is so obnoxiously annoying and (28:47 - 28:51)
useless (28:50 - 28:53)
that you're just like why are you here (28:51 - 28:55)
do you know do you know why (28:53 - 28:57)
he's obnoxious and useless he like (28:55 - 28:58)
lysander y (28:57 - 29:01)
comes you have mid mission and he's like (28:58 - 29:02)
i (29:01 - 29:04)
gotta take a picture of that's that (29:02 - 29:06)
executor and you're like get out of here (29:04 - 29:07)
man i'm trying to (29:06 - 29:10)
this is why you don't have the medal go (29:07 - 29:11)
out and take some photos buddy wait (29:10 - 29:14)
wait so you mean so he he phone calls (29:11 - 29:15)
you (29:14 - 29:18)
like todd in a previous pokemon yeah (29:15 - 29:19)
yeah (29:18 - 29:21)
just to tell you know that his rattata (29:19 - 29:23)
isn't the top percentage of what (29:21 - 29:27)
does see because todd is his mentor (29:23 - 29:30)
it's just the wrong todd (29:27 - 29:32)
correct yes yeah there are two there are (29:30 - 29:34)
two tops (29:32 - 29:38)
so he got confused because he thought (29:34 - 29:41)
phone caller todd was photographer todd (29:38 - 29:42)
and that's why he keeps calling you at (29:41 - 29:44)
the most inappropriate moments to tell (29:42 - 29:45)
you about (29:44 - 29:47)
things when you don't want to hear them (29:45 - 29:48)
but also (29:47 - 29:50)
he hates you because the minute he ran (29:48 - 29:52)
on screen and i was watching your stream (29:50 - 29:55)
you said oh here's a dude with beyblade (29:52 - 29:56)
hair and i don't know what your (29:55 - 29:57)
obsession (29:56 - 29:59)
with beyblade is that you accuse all (29:57 - 30:01)
these people of having they played hair (29:59 - 30:02)
i don't even (30:01 - 30:03)
know if you know what that is it's (30:02 - 30:06)
because you know i'm not sure what (30:03 - 30:07)
beyblade is at this point but i remember (30:06 - 30:09)
there was a beyblade (30:07 - 30:11)
i was a remember i remember there was a (30:09 - 30:13)
beyblade anime (30:11 - 30:16)
and yes and i feel like the characters (30:13 - 30:18)
in beyblade had a very distinct (30:16 - 30:20)
hairstyle and (30:18 - 30:23)
art style and so when babe when beyblade (30:20 - 30:25)
phil comes up and he's like (30:23 - 30:29)
let it rip like he just he oozes (30:25 - 30:32)
the beyblade persona big beyblade (30:29 - 30:37)
baby big baby the bbe (30:32 - 30:37)
i remember his name his name's cameron (30:44 - 30:49)
he is the spoiler for black and white (30:46 - 30:52)
he is the dude that beats ash he has (30:49 - 30:53)
five pokemon (30:52 - 30:56)
in the elite in the in the victory road (30:53 - 30:57)
or whatever (30:56 - 31:00)
and ash had six because because cameron (30:57 - 31:01)
is running (31:00 - 31:05)
bbe and he he has so much bbe (31:01 - 31:08)
he's like i forgot that i'm supposed to (31:05 - 31:09)
bring six pokemon (31:08 - 31:11)
and i only brought five and ash is like (31:09 - 31:13)
oh sucks to be you i brought six and (31:11 - 31:14)
then ash still (31:13 - 31:17)
loses to cameron uh but cameron was (31:14 - 31:20)
was let it rip as well cameron was very (31:17 - 31:22)
let it rip (31:20 - 31:23)
look there's a couple beyblade (31:22 - 31:24)
characters that exist in the pokemon (31:23 - 31:25)
world it's fine (31:24 - 31:26)
phil though is the worst part of the (31:25 - 31:29)
game he's awful i every time he talks i (31:26 - 31:30)
want to just (31:29 - 31:33)
like why are you here he's there for (31:30 - 31:33)
like (31:33 - 31:36)
a hot second but you don't even have the (31:33 - 31:37)
option at the beginning of the game to (31:36 - 31:39)
have the characters not speak (31:37 - 31:42)
yes or speak in japanese i think the (31:39 - 31:42)
problem i (31:42 - 31:46)
have with phil is so far after 20 hours (31:42 - 31:49)
phil has done nothing except that's why (31:46 - 31:50)
he got his thing (31:49 - 31:53)
revoked and sec and he he just takes (31:50 - 31:54)
away time from rita who (31:53 - 31:57)
rita like she's just excited she's ready (31:54 - 31:58)
to go (31:57 - 32:00)
she's like give me your photos no no no (31:58 - 32:02)
conflict is what drives drama it (32:00 - 32:05)
drives plot like phil's conflict (32:02 - 32:09)
is like i stubbed my toe (32:05 - 32:12)
and i you need you to hear about it it's (32:09 - 32:14)
like it's (32:12 - 32:16)
that's why you see this is this is this (32:14 - 32:17)
is the old saying you (32:16 - 32:21)
hate in others what you hate in yourself (32:17 - 32:24)
maybe i am the phil maybe you are the (32:21 - 32:26)
beyblade (32:24 - 32:29)
i was gonna say have you ever judged (32:26 - 32:29)
let it rip all the time that's part of (32:32 - 32:36)
it but it's like (32:35 - 32:37)
i've been the beyblade you've been for (32:36 - 32:40)
the place (32:37 - 32:40)
do you know what they say is if you (32:41 - 32:45)
can't (32:44 - 32:48)
find the bbe in the room you (32:45 - 32:51)
are the bbb in the room yes but (32:48 - 32:54)
very true have you never had a (32:51 - 32:54)
friendship (32:54 - 32:57)
where it's like it's a friend but yeah (32:54 - 32:59)
absolutely no i've never had a (32:57 - 33:01)
friendship whatever (32:59 - 33:03)
where you don't like really like the (33:01 - 33:04)
person (33:03 - 33:07)
so your option is to either ignore them (33:04 - 33:08)
but if you ignore them then they're not (33:07 - 33:10)
going to think that you're friends and (33:08 - 33:11)
that's going to cause a whole kind of (33:10 - 33:12)
other issue (33:11 - 33:14)
drama so what you do is you constantly (33:12 - 33:15)
call them (33:14 - 33:18)
with like very insignificant meaningless (33:15 - 33:19)
boring things (33:18 - 33:21)
so eventually they don't want to be your (33:19 - 33:23)
friend anymore and they go away on their (33:21 - 33:23)
own (33:23 - 33:26)
you drive them away phil phil drives (33:23 - 33:28)
people away it is the ultimate goal of (33:26 - 33:29)
pokemon snap (33:28 - 33:33)
to bring phil in to love your inner fill (33:29 - 33:40)
yes to let your inner fill rip (33:33 - 33:40)
we're going to take a break (33:41 - 33:45)
and when we come back we'll actually (33:44 - 33:47)
talk about the photography part of (33:45 - 33:49)
pokemon (33:47 - 33:50)
[Music] (33:49 - 33:54)
so we will be right back (33:50 - 33:54)
what is a nidoran supposed to be it's a (33:55 - 33:59)
mix of a porcupine (33:58 - 34:03)
a rabbit dinosaurs mouse whales (33:59 - 34:06)
jackalope probably a horse and hamster (34:03 - 34:07)
porcupine (34:06 - 34:11)
a rabbit dinosaur is a mountain whales (34:07 - 34:14)
jackalopes probably a horse (34:11 - 34:17)
yeah but then like what is but then what (34:14 - 34:18)
are like what is it (34:17 - 34:21)
but then what is nidoran supposed to be (34:18 - 34:22)
a porcupine (34:21 - 34:25)
a rabbit dinosaur is a mouse whale (34:22 - 34:28)
jackalope probably a horse an hamster (34:25 - 34:29)
porcupine (34:28 - 34:33)
a rabbit dinosaurs a mouse whale (34:29 - 34:35)
jackalope probably a horse in the (34:33 - 34:36)
amsterdam (34:35 - 34:39)
[Music] (34:36 - 34:39)
we are back from our break (34:41 - 34:47)
more pokemon snap we have to this is the (34:45 - 34:50)
question people want to know (34:47 - 34:51)
the question people want to know is (34:50 - 34:53)
should i go out and pay 60 (34:51 - 34:56)
for this video game and that was (34:53 - 34:59)
probably i said this earlier in the show (34:56 - 35:01)
our biggest hesitation going into this (34:59 - 35:01)
because (35:01 - 35:05)
i still don't think that back in (35:01 - 35:07)
2000 2001 when whenever pokemon snap (35:05 - 35:08)
came out (35:07 - 35:10)
as much as i loved that game as a kid (35:08 - 35:12)
one i was a dumb kid i didn't understand (35:10 - 35:13)
money (35:12 - 35:15)
but two as like an adult you guys were (35:13 - 35:16)
both adults when that game came (35:15 - 35:18)
out yep and i still bought it back then (35:16 - 35:19)
and i was still mad about the price (35:18 - 35:22)
like pokemon snap was not worth 50. (35:19 - 35:25)
it was 50 because nintendo 64 games were (35:22 - 35:26)
50. (35:25 - 35:28)
or were they 40. i think it was 40 i (35:26 - 35:29)
think i got (35:28 - 35:31)
it i think i got it on sale for 39.99 i (35:29 - 35:32)
think it was (35:31 - 35:35)
like list price was 49.99 well (35:32 - 35:37)
i think you could buy it there was a ten (35:35 - 35:38)
dollars off whatever yeah there were (35:37 - 35:40)
some 64 games that were (35:38 - 35:42)
yeah yeah i think the 60 games were like (35:40 - 35:43)
donkey kong because it came with the (35:42 - 35:45)
expansion (35:43 - 35:45)
[Laughter] (35:46 - 35:52)
pokemon snap and we we spent a whole (35:50 - 35:53)
episode about this (35:52 - 35:56)
was like a perfect go to blockbuster on (35:53 - 35:57)
friday (35:56 - 36:00)
rent it for 3.99 and then a month later (35:57 - 36:01)
be like (36:00 - 36:03)
i'm in the mood for pokemon snap and do (36:01 - 36:04)
it again that there's no way that game (36:03 - 36:05)
was worth the 40 (36:04 - 36:07)
it was unless you were that is yeah (36:05 - 36:09)
basically what i did except (36:07 - 36:12)
uh potomac video not blockbuster i will (36:09 - 36:14)
say this i bought it originally and then (36:12 - 36:17)
i bought it again on virtual console (36:14 - 36:18)
but at virtual console for the what was (36:17 - 36:20)
that virtual console 10 15 bucks (36:18 - 36:23)
yeah it feels like a yeah better price (36:20 - 36:24)
it was a better price it was like (36:23 - 36:27)
uh fine i'll buy it again it's fun (36:24 - 36:27)
enough (36:27 - 36:30)
and (36:27 - 36:30)
pokemons the new pokemon snap is fun (36:32 - 36:36)
enough it pushes me to (36:34 - 36:39)
the is this really worth the amount of (36:36 - 36:41)
money that i paid for it limit (36:39 - 36:44)
like i don't regret buying it and i (36:41 - 36:48)
i don't i am having (36:44 - 36:51)
fun with it i need to i need to (36:48 - 36:54)
put closer on some of these things uh (36:51 - 36:58)
but i think i think that asking price is (36:54 - 36:59)
a real stretch (36:58 - 37:03)
i think you are unless you get really (36:59 - 37:05)
into the gameplay and really (37:03 - 37:08)
like oh i'm in the grinding of it (37:05 - 37:10)
because there is a lot of grinding to be (37:08 - 37:11)
done (37:10 - 37:15)
um then you'll never (37:11 - 37:17)
blink about you'll never think twice (37:15 - 37:18)
about the price (37:17 - 37:20)
um and it's so i'm going to say this (37:18 - 37:22)
like your experience is very different (37:20 - 37:24)
than my experience because (37:22 - 37:26)
i'm gonna say you have a bunch of people (37:24 - 37:28)
watching and interacting with you (37:26 - 37:31)
and that helps distract from the grind (37:28 - 37:34)
quality of it so saturday morning (37:31 - 37:36)
as i'm grinding through the same levels (37:34 - 37:38)
over and over and over again (37:36 - 37:40)
to try to get this one research picture (37:38 - 37:42)
or this one thing that i need to get (37:40 - 37:45)
that perfect ducklet that (37:42 - 37:48)
began to really wear on (37:45 - 37:52)
on my enjoyment of the game uh without (37:48 - 37:52)
sort of (37:52 - 37:54)
having like i'm not going to have a new (37:52 - 37:56)
picture to post online or i'm not going (37:54 - 37:58)
to get something that i want to put up (37:56 - 38:00)
for people to interact with (37:58 - 38:02)
having to redo the levels even though (38:00 - 38:03)
they change (38:02 - 38:05)
enough every time that it feels a little (38:03 - 38:06)
bit different (38:05 - 38:09)
i'm still feeling i began to really feel (38:06 - 38:11)
the grind saturday morning and to be (38:09 - 38:12)
honest i haven't gone back and played (38:11 - 38:13)
yet (38:12 - 38:16)
uh there i i can definitely see where it (38:13 - 38:18)
coming from because day two (38:16 - 38:22)
i felt like i played for five hours and (38:18 - 38:22)
i got (38:22 - 38:25)
i didn't make progress yeah like like i (38:22 - 38:26)
made progress in (38:25 - 38:28)
like okay that picture's slightly better (38:26 - 38:30)
that picture is like slightly better but (38:28 - 38:33)
you hit a it it's like um (38:30 - 38:36)
gosh what kind of game is it where (38:33 - 38:39)
like it's it's really good it's almost (38:36 - 38:39)
like (38:39 - 38:41)
it's almost like completing a pokedex (38:39 - 38:42)
yeah (38:41 - 38:44)
when when you first start the game (38:42 - 38:46)
you're like this is new this is new this (38:44 - 38:47)
is new this is new and then you get to (38:46 - 38:50)
like 200 of 300 and you're just like (38:47 - 38:53)
oh okay well i guess like like (38:50 - 38:55)
it feels like it took me five hours to (38:53 - 38:58)
get these 200 and now it's gonna take me (38:55 - 39:00)
20 hours to get these last 100 because (38:58 - 39:02)
that's where the that's where the grind (39:00 - 39:04)
actually is like the one percent pokemon (39:02 - 39:05)
and stuff (39:04 - 39:06)
um so i definitely see where you're (39:05 - 39:09)
coming from i think though like (39:06 - 39:12)
i am so glad i was wrong (39:09 - 39:14)
leading up to this point because i just (39:12 - 39:16)
didn't think that this game was going to (39:14 - 39:17)
be (39:16 - 39:21)
like i like i i argue i'm already (39:17 - 39:22)
arguing in my head whether this is one (39:21 - 39:25)
of the best pokemon spin-off games ever (39:22 - 39:29)
um because like it's though (39:25 - 39:32)
conquest is good you you originally (39:29 - 39:33)
thought it was going to be like a four (39:32 - 39:35)
hour game and you have now played this (39:33 - 39:36)
game for like 20 hours (39:35 - 39:39)
yeah yeah and i'm like not even i i'm i (39:36 - 39:40)
don't even think i'm halfway through and (39:39 - 39:41)
i don't think i play (39:40 - 39:43)
i don't (39:41 - 39:43)
[Music] (39:45 - 39:48)
uh i will say like i'm at the point (39:49 - 39:54)
where i'm beginning to (39:53 - 39:56)
struggle with wanting to can you (39:54 - 39:58)
continue with the game (39:56 - 40:00)
it's good that new areas are opening up (39:58 - 40:03)
and i can do new things and that helps (40:00 - 40:05)
that helps reset the grind when a new (40:03 - 40:07)
area opens up and you get that first (40:05 - 40:09)
initial flush of seeing all sorts of new (40:07 - 40:11)
great things and you can (40:09 - 40:13)
kind of (40:11 - 40:13)
get excited about it again (40:14 - 40:19)
but i do agree with some of the reviews (40:17 - 40:20)
that the game is fun (40:19 - 40:23)
but then the grind sets in and you (40:20 - 40:24)
either will find the grind (40:23 - 40:28)
enjoyable or it will just be (40:24 - 40:31)
you know the peliper around your neck (40:28 - 40:32)
but (40:31 - 40:34)
that's the fundamental rule of grind (40:32 - 40:35)
yeah right if it's (40:34 - 40:38)
the game that you love right then you (40:35 - 40:39)
love the grind (40:38 - 40:41)
right it's the same with monster hunter (40:39 - 40:43)
right if i have to kill (40:41 - 40:46)
the monster that i love 30 times i it (40:43 - 40:46)
doesn't matter (40:46 - 40:49)
monster hunter i love it and i will go i (40:46 - 40:51)
will do it 40 times (40:49 - 40:54)
and and like that's just like if the (40:51 - 40:55)
grind is in the game that you love right (40:54 - 40:55)
then (40:55 - 40:58)
you love it if not then it's just grind (40:55 - 41:00)
and it's work and it's like why am i (40:58 - 41:00)
doing this (41:00 - 41:04)
yeah but like i just (41:00 - 41:06)
in watching steve stream the game which (41:04 - 41:07)
is really what (41:06 - 41:10)
pushed me to get it i was like (41:07 - 41:13)
i really like these graphics i think (41:10 - 41:14)
it's a lot of fun (41:13 - 41:16)
how you can interact with the pokemon (41:14 - 41:18)
with you know even though it is limited (41:16 - 41:20)
interaction (41:18 - 41:23)
um and i just you know i kind of like (41:20 - 41:25)
just enjoy the concept as (41:23 - 41:28)
as a fun i have paid 60 dollars for (41:25 - 41:29)
games and played them (41:28 - 41:32)
for less amount of time yeah right so (41:29 - 41:34)
i think if you okay so this is another (41:32 - 41:36)
question i got like i can get my pros (41:34 - 41:37)
and cons (41:36 - 41:38)
at some point if you want like there's (41:37 - 41:39)
things that i love about other things (41:38 - 41:41)
that i currently hate about it yeah (41:39 - 41:43)
there's only like two actual gameplay (41:41 - 41:45)
things i don't love (41:43 - 41:47)
and and i don't like phil but otherwise (41:45 - 41:48)
gosh i'm so positive on this game (41:47 - 41:50)
uh but the the thing i will say like if (41:48 - 41:53)
you didn't like the first pokemon snap (41:50 - 41:54)
i don't you're not gonna like this one (41:53 - 41:55)
yeah i don't think this game is gonna (41:54 - 41:56)
convince you (41:55 - 41:59)
anyway if you didn't play the first (41:56 - 42:00)
pokemon snap (41:59 - 42:03)
that's like a harder question to answer (42:00 - 42:03)
because (42:03 - 42:06)
pokemon snap is pretty unique in what it (42:03 - 42:08)
does (42:06 - 42:10)
but i would say it's probably closer to (42:08 - 42:11)
like (42:10 - 42:13)
a shooter like you point and shoot and (42:11 - 42:15)
you take photos (42:13 - 42:17)
um and even if you're you would be bad (42:15 - 42:19)
at shooters and you're on on rails so (42:17 - 42:20)
it's um (42:19 - 42:22)
like you're not moving again some people (42:20 - 42:23)
have never played it so maybe they (42:22 - 42:24)
maybe they're watching and they're like (42:23 - 42:27)
are you moving (42:24 - 42:30)
the game moves for you uh (42:27 - 42:33)
that is hard for me to say you should go (42:30 - 42:35)
out and get it unless you're just a huge (42:33 - 42:37)
pokemon fan i think if you're a huge (42:35 - 42:40)
pokemon fan and you're on the fence (42:37 - 42:42)
i would tell you to pull the trigger um (42:40 - 42:44)
because i think the (42:42 - 42:47)
moments in the game are still super (42:44 - 42:50)
worth it uh there's just so many (42:47 - 42:52)
interactions between pokemon and maybe (42:50 - 42:53)
like (42:52 - 42:55)
maybe the better argument is like oh (42:53 - 42:57)
well what pokemon do you like (42:55 - 42:59)
because they're in the game like i knew (42:57 - 43:01)
my i knew irene (42:59 - 43:03)
loved score bunny so when she sat down (43:01 - 43:04)
and played it (43:03 - 43:06)
oh i i do have another bad thing the (43:04 - 43:08)
tutorial in this game (43:06 - 43:11)
is bad it's bad uh it's bad i haven't (43:08 - 43:12)
gotten that far it might be worse than (43:11 - 43:14)
sun and moon's tutorial i'm not saying a (43:12 - 43:14)
lot (43:14 - 43:16)
i don't know have you have you (43:14 - 43:18)
re-watched diamond and pearl's tutorial (43:16 - 43:20)
that's like four hours long (43:18 - 43:23)
uh it's so (43:20 - 43:23)
it's not super long it just it feels so (43:24 - 43:31)
basic that it feels long like they (43:28 - 43:31)
explain (43:31 - 43:34)
things in a start stop (43:31 - 43:37)
method like did you get that point and (43:34 - 43:38)
it's like okay (43:37 - 43:42)
yeah i got it feels it doesn't feel (43:38 - 43:43)
the information they're conveying in the (43:42 - 43:45)
tutorial feels fine (43:43 - 43:49)
but it just feels so slow yeah it feels (43:45 - 43:49)
like (43:49 - 43:51)
they they go and stop they go and stop (43:49 - 43:52)
and keep in mind (43:51 - 43:54)
it's an all ages game right they (43:52 - 43:57)
probably should have (43:54 - 43:59)
at some point given you an option of do (43:57 - 44:01)
you need a lot of explanation or a (43:59 - 44:03)
little explanation (44:01 - 44:04)
and then for younger folks that they're (44:03 - 44:06)
going to need a lot of explanation (44:04 - 44:10)
but i don't think the game (44:06 - 44:13)
the game has a good pacing in the fact (44:10 - 44:16)
that like when you go out on your first (44:13 - 44:18)
mission i don't know what they call it (44:16 - 44:21)
photo photography mission (44:18 - 44:24)
you only have your camera (44:21 - 44:26)
yeah you drive at any point and you (44:24 - 44:28)
shoot and then like the second time you (44:26 - 44:28)
go (44:28 - 44:30)
you get your scanner and then the third (44:28 - 44:31)
time you go you get your apples or (44:30 - 44:32)
whatever i'm not (44:31 - 44:35)
even there maybe it's like fruit yeah um (44:32 - 44:39)
when do i get my illumina orbs and so i (44:35 - 44:42)
i felt like the tutorial was (44:39 - 44:45)
you have like a 12 week program (44:42 - 44:47)
and that you're like the tutorial felt (44:45 - 44:49)
like (44:47 - 44:52)
two whole lessons of the 12 weeks and (44:49 - 44:54)
you're like we could have just done this (44:52 - 44:54)
in like (44:54 - 44:56)
one lesson why are we stretching out why (44:54 - 44:58)
this is taking so long let me just get (44:56 - 44:59)
through it (44:58 - 45:00)
it's not the end of the world obviously (44:59 - 45:02)
you go through the tutorial and then you (45:00 - 45:04)
got 19 hours more of gameplay to do in (45:02 - 45:06)
the tutorials maybe at most like (45:04 - 45:08)
five minutes seven minutes or something (45:06 - 45:10)
it feels long um (45:08 - 45:14)
but going back to irene i (45:10 - 45:16)
knew she liked the first pokemon snap (45:14 - 45:17)
she didn't play (45:16 - 45:18)
the first time she played it was like (45:17 - 45:20)
three years ago so pretty recently (45:18 - 45:22)
she thought it was really cute she was (45:20 - 45:24)
really bad at it because she's bad at (45:22 - 45:27)
pointing and aiming on video games like (45:24 - 45:29)
doesn't have those she's not you know (45:27 - 45:31)
she's not like a halo pro (45:29 - 45:34)
very bad at shooting um but (45:31 - 45:37)
i gave her my game so no tutorial i (45:34 - 45:38)
didn't tell her about the apples i (45:37 - 45:39)
didn't tell her about the scan i didn't (45:38 - 45:41)
tell her about the illuminati balls i (45:39 - 45:43)
was like here this is the trigger you (45:41 - 45:45)
pull this is the a button you press to (45:43 - 45:47)
shoot it's just like a (45:45 - 45:49)
apex legends you know point at something (45:47 - 45:50)
take a picture (45:49 - 45:52)
but for me it was like i am going to (45:50 - 45:56)
give you the levels of pokemon you like (45:52 - 45:58)
so here's the first level with score (45:56 - 45:59)
bunny because she loves score bunny and (45:58 - 46:01)
then i was like here is the level with (45:59 - 46:02)
marine because she loves marine (46:01 - 46:05)
and both of those levels like threw her (46:02 - 46:06)
over the moon she was just so (46:05 - 46:09)
excited and it was also really (46:06 - 46:10)
interesting to see (46:09 - 46:12)
her because she always struggles to say (46:10 - 46:14)
like which pokemon she likes and doesn't (46:12 - 46:15)
like (46:14 - 46:16)
so it was really cool to like see her (46:15 - 46:18)
reaction of like (46:16 - 46:20)
pokemon that i feel like she doesn't (46:18 - 46:21)
think about all the time like she (46:20 - 46:23)
freaked out when she saw (46:21 - 46:24)
beware and i feel like she's never (46:23 - 46:26)
brought up beware in a conversation (46:24 - 46:26)
before (46:26 - 46:29)
but that was like really cute to see so (46:26 - 46:31)
i would say like maybe if you're on the (46:29 - 46:32)
fence (46:31 - 46:33)
you're a huge pokemon fan you didn't (46:32 - 46:35)
play pokemon snap you're on the fence (46:33 - 46:38)
i would maybe even look at the roster of (46:35 - 46:39)
pokemon (46:38 - 46:40)
because like seeing your favorite (46:39 - 46:42)
pokemon doing (46:40 - 46:45)
something like they they do things in (46:42 - 46:46)
this game (46:45 - 46:48)
they just don't stand there like like in (46:46 - 46:49)
store and shield they're just walking (46:48 - 46:51)
around and that's fine and that's cool (46:49 - 46:53)
but like their interactions between (46:51 - 46:54)
other pokemon (46:53 - 46:57)
right uh the music the the apples the (46:54 - 46:58)
scanny thing (46:57 - 47:01)
it's just so charming well that's one (46:58 - 47:02)
thing i was going to say is (47:01 - 47:05)
if you've ever in your life said i wish (47:02 - 47:06)
i could see pokemon (47:05 - 47:09)
going around in the world yeah this is (47:06 - 47:11)
the game for that yes (47:09 - 47:14)
this is the whole the entirety of the (47:11 - 47:16)
game is the pokemon are in the world (47:14 - 47:18)
that's probably my number one positive (47:16 - 47:19)
of the game (47:18 - 47:22)
the levels look beautiful (47:19 - 47:25)
the interactions that they have in the (47:22 - 47:27)
game are super fun (47:25 - 47:29)
super cool the things that they do and (47:27 - 47:30)
interact (47:29 - 47:34)
they're i i don't want to say that (47:30 - 47:35)
they're surprising because (47:34 - 47:37)
if you think about it's like oh yeah (47:35 - 47:39)
that's what that pokemon is and that's (47:37 - 47:40)
what that pokemon would do (47:39 - 47:44)
but i think it's like weirdly affirming (47:40 - 47:45)
because you're seeing things that you'd (47:44 - 47:46)
only (47:45 - 47:49)
necessarily imagined uh actually (47:46 - 47:50)
happening (47:49 - 47:53)
and that that part of the game is super (47:50 - 47:57)
fun and exciting and the levels (47:53 - 48:00)
change so as you do more things and more (47:57 - 48:03)
pokemon come in or out or you've altered (48:00 - 48:04)
how things work a little bit the (48:03 - 48:06)
interactions change (48:04 - 48:09)
so there is some (48:06 - 48:13)
level of newness every time you go (48:09 - 48:16)
in uh that (48:13 - 48:19)
diminishes over time like this i would (48:16 - 48:21)
say like the second time when you get to (48:19 - 48:23)
level two of a route and there's a whole (48:21 - 48:24)
bunch of changes (48:23 - 48:26)
it's as exciting as the first time (48:24 - 48:27)
you're in there but then (48:26 - 48:29)
when you're grinding through level two (48:27 - 48:31)
to try to get to level three to get the (48:29 - 48:32)
next thing (48:31 - 48:36)
the game really drags (48:32 - 48:40)
ah yeah um there's (48:36 - 48:42)
again it felt like when i was unlocking (48:40 - 48:43)
research levels (48:42 - 48:45)
i was unlocking them after two runs and (48:43 - 48:46)
last night (48:45 - 48:48)
i was like i just we did this volcano (48:46 - 48:50)
four times in a row and why (48:48 - 48:52)
why is it why did it slow down like it (48:50 - 48:53)
almost like it artificially slows down (48:52 - 48:56)
because it knows your (48:53 - 48:58)
it it knows you're grinding it over and (48:56 - 49:00)
over again it's very weird (48:58 - 49:02)
very weird like it's like i took 70 (49:00 - 49:04)
photos and you're only giving me (49:02 - 49:06)
it's 8 000 experience where in like this (49:04 - 49:09)
course i took 70 and you're giving me 50 (49:06 - 49:10)
000 it's like why (49:09 - 49:11)
is why did this suddenly change from (49:10 - 49:13)
today to yesterday that part seems (49:11 - 49:16)
weird so i mean the thing that i think (49:13 - 49:18)
is frustrating is you're only getting (49:16 - 49:18)
experience (49:18 - 49:22)
for the ones that you show and if they (49:18 - 49:24)
make a big enough difference (49:22 - 49:28)
so if you have a worse picture (49:24 - 49:32)
of a cachnia and it doesn't unlock a (49:28 - 49:33)
research test none of my cactions are (49:32 - 49:35)
bad pictures (49:33 - 49:37)
yeah they are i've saw them but if you'd (49:35 - 49:39)
like have a great picture if like you (49:37 - 49:41)
got lucky and took a perfect picture of (49:39 - 49:42)
cacne you're never gonna (49:41 - 49:44)
get better and you're never going to get (49:42 - 49:47)
experience for the subsequent (49:44 - 49:50)
ones after and that slows down the game (49:47 - 49:52)
because unless you're (49:50 - 49:53)
specifically trying to take a picture of (49:52 - 49:56)
a cac need to fulfill a research task (49:53 - 49:57)
and we'll talk about the research tasks (49:56 - 49:59)
i'm assuming (49:57 - 50:02)
um then it's like okay well i'm i've (49:59 - 50:03)
already got four perfect picture (50:02 - 50:05)
pictures of a cacnia (50:03 - 50:08)
this section of this path is useless to (50:05 - 50:09)
me (50:08 - 50:10)
or this i'm just going to sit here until (50:09 - 50:12)
i get past it that's (50:10 - 50:14)
so it's not useless just sit back and (50:12 - 50:16)
enjoy the view (50:14 - 50:18)
i think i i think i wouldn't say it's (50:16 - 50:20)
useless i would say that at a certain (50:18 - 50:22)
point (50:20 - 50:25)
when you're going back through routes (50:22 - 50:26)
you have to pick and choose (50:25 - 50:30)
you do so if if like where the cacnia is (50:26 - 50:31)
there's also (50:30 - 50:34)
heliolisk and um i think like manda buzz (50:31 - 50:35)
there's a couple others so you're you're (50:34 - 50:37)
pretty much at that point being like (50:35 - 50:39)
like i'm to the point in the game where (50:37 - 50:41)
if i'm going through park (50:39 - 50:43)
i'm like these like i know that there's (50:41 - 50:45)
these pokemon at the beginning these (50:43 - 50:46)
pokemon in the middle these pokemon at (50:45 - 50:47)
the end and i (50:46 - 50:49)
my my beginning is going to be focused (50:47 - 50:50)
on pichu my middle is going to be (50:49 - 50:51)
focused on ducklit (50:50 - 50:53)
and then my end is going to be focused (50:51 - 50:55)
on like sylveon and you have to start (50:53 - 50:57)
making those choices (50:55 - 51:02)
because it's not it's not because like (50:57 - 51:02)
you already have the pictures of (51:02 - 51:06)
everything else you probably do you (51:04 - 51:07)
probably have the (51:06 - 51:09)
torterras and the hoot hoots and the the (51:07 - 51:10)
swanos (51:09 - 51:12)
the the reason you have to make those (51:10 - 51:14)
choices is because you have to get a (51:12 - 51:15)
better shot (51:14 - 51:18)
and if you and you only have uh moments (51:15 - 51:21)
to get that shot so you kind of have to (51:18 - 51:22)
ignore everything else (51:21 - 51:24)
and i don't think that's a bad part of (51:22 - 51:25)
the game that's something you kind of (51:24 - 51:26)
had to do in the first pokemon snap (51:25 - 51:28)
where like all right this run i'm going (51:26 - 51:31)
to only focus on sand slash for this run (51:28 - 51:32)
i'm going to get the magikarp that (51:31 - 51:34)
monkey's going to hit the magikarp guard (51:32 - 51:35)
is going to come out (51:34 - 51:37)
i'm only focused on gyarados uh so i (51:35 - 51:39)
don't think that's bad but you (51:37 - 51:42)
your runs start getting very (51:39 - 51:46)
focused and that's when (51:42 - 51:50)
the grind comes out uh which is (51:46 - 51:52)
i mean you're trying to top high scores (51:50 - 51:53)
so like (51:52 - 51:55)
there's no i mean if you're playing (51:53 - 51:57)
mario you're playing pac-man playing (51:55 - 51:58)
frogger (51:57 - 52:01)
you're optimizing the best routes (51:58 - 52:03)
because you want to beat that score (52:01 - 52:05)
so you do have to you could play this (52:03 - 52:07)
game i guess two ways or both ways (52:05 - 52:08)
you play the game where you're like i (52:07 - 52:11)
don't care about (52:08 - 52:14)
getting the highest rankings i just want (52:11 - 52:16)
one photo of every pokemon (52:14 - 52:19)
and technically there's four photos of (52:16 - 52:20)
every pokemon (52:19 - 52:22)
which we haven't talked about and you (52:20 - 52:23)
could probably (52:22 - 52:25)
get a photo of not even every pokemon (52:23 - 52:27)
you don't need every pokemon to you know (52:25 - 52:29)
complete the story and see the credits (52:27 - 52:33)
and for people that i saw s speed run (52:29 - 52:33)
the game (52:33 - 52:35)
within the first weekend then by speed (52:33 - 52:36)
run i mean they try to get (52:35 - 52:39)
the credits as fast as possible joe from (52:36 - 52:40)
cereby (52:39 - 52:42)
said that he got credits for the first (52:40 - 52:44)
time in 12 hours and he was playing you (52:42 - 52:46)
know as fast as possible so he could get (52:44 - 52:50)
stuff on the site there was a youtuber (52:46 - 52:51)
that got beat the entire game in eight (52:50 - 52:53)
hours because they just wanted to see (52:51 - 52:54)
how fast they could get credits (52:53 - 52:56)
um a lot of reviewers from whether (52:54 - 52:59)
that's like ign or comicbook.com or (52:56 - 53:01)
game spot not to be confused with (52:59 - 53:02)
gamestop they said (53:01 - 53:04)
that most of their credits came at about (53:02 - 53:06)
20 hours (53:04 - 53:08)
i'm 20 hours and i haven't seen credits (53:06 - 53:10)
so if you don't care about the high (53:08 - 53:10)
score (53:10 - 53:13)
right and somebody says hey this for me (53:10 - 53:14)
personally (53:13 - 53:16)
if somebody says hey for 60 bucks you're (53:14 - 53:18)
getting a 20 hour game (53:16 - 53:20)
i think that's worth it i think that is (53:18 - 53:22)
a lot of content like i played uncharted (53:20 - 53:22)
one two (53:22 - 53:24)
three i played the last of us i don't (53:22 - 53:25)
know why i just named a bunch of naughty (53:24 - 53:26)
dog games (53:25 - 53:29)
but all of those games were 60 and i all (53:26 - 53:31)
of those games i would say were about 15 (53:29 - 53:32)
hours long (53:31 - 53:34)
and i 100 thought that like my 15 hours (53:32 - 53:36)
and the last of us or my 15 hours in (53:34 - 53:37)
uncharted 4 was (53:36 - 53:41)
super worth it um but if you want a (53:37 - 53:42)
hundred percent (53:41 - 53:45)
the game you do have to (53:42 - 53:47)
accept that you're going to do the (53:45 - 53:50)
levels over and over and the levels are (53:47 - 53:54)
the loop i think the loop is good but (53:50 - 53:57)
your uh serentona (53:54 - 54:01)
serotonin hit is like way better (53:57 - 54:04)
earlier on versus the uh the end where (54:01 - 54:06)
you're just like (54:04 - 54:07)
well i'm gonna spend three minutes just (54:06 - 54:09)
focusing on deflate (54:07 - 54:11)
i'd go with dopamine over cereal yeah (54:09 - 54:13)
okay there you go a dopamine hit (54:11 - 54:16)
is is better uh yeah i would agree with (54:13 - 54:16)
that (54:16 - 54:20)
um you know you're (54:16 - 54:23)
you're worth wildness out of time like i (54:20 - 54:24)
wouldn't a (54:23 - 54:28)
as an epic rpg player 15 hours is (54:24 - 54:31)
is a short amount of time because i (54:28 - 54:32)
expect long stories (54:31 - 54:36)
from my games granted this is a (54:32 - 54:37)
different game (54:36 - 54:40)
um but like it's it's a similar style (54:37 - 54:42)
like i don't like first person shooters (54:40 - 54:44)
but i loved bioshock bioshock was well (54:42 - 54:46)
worth my money because the story was (54:44 - 54:46)
incredible (54:46 - 54:49)
and it was a fairly long game this sits (54:46 - 54:50)
very much (54:49 - 54:53)
on the fence for me um i would agree (54:50 - 54:54)
with like (54:53 - 54:55)
if you're a big fan of pokemon and (54:54 - 54:57)
you've never played snap before or if (54:55 - 54:59)
you're just a big fan of pokemon (54:57 - 55:02)
you will find a lot of worth in this (54:59 - 55:03)
game (55:02 - 55:06)
um my complaints are i do have (55:03 - 55:08)
complaints but my complaints are (55:06 - 55:12)
relatively few compared to (55:08 - 55:12)
the fun that i've gotten out of the (55:12 - 55:16)
first levels and the (55:14 - 55:18)
and and that sort of initial rush of all (55:16 - 55:19)
of the (55:18 - 55:22)
routes that i've unlocked so far um (55:19 - 55:23)
that's super fun (55:22 - 55:25)
i think the online interaction is super (55:23 - 55:26)
fun being able to post things and see (55:25 - 55:28)
people's stuff (55:26 - 55:31)
all of those things push me more that i (55:28 - 55:33)
feel like i got my money's worth out of (55:31 - 55:35)
this game your mileage (55:33 - 55:38)
may vary um but i think if you're on the (55:35 - 55:41)
fence but you're leaning (55:38 - 55:45)
yes or you're on the fence i would say (55:41 - 55:48)
you will get a solid 20 hours (55:45 - 55:52)
credits are no of fun out of this game (55:48 - 55:55)
before you really hit any sort of (55:52 - 55:58)
grindiness or (55:55 - 55:58)
where the grind becomes unbearable (55:59 - 56:05)
yeah i don't think i got it i didn't (56:02 - 56:07)
start (56:05 - 56:07)
i guess hardcore repeating levels until (56:08 - 56:12)
about (56:10 - 56:16)
maybe 12 hours in (56:12 - 56:19)
but i haven't i also haven't unlocked (56:16 - 56:19)
everything (56:19 - 56:22)
yeah i haven't either and they do this (56:19 - 56:23)
interesting thing so in the first (56:22 - 56:25)
pokemon snap (56:23 - 56:27)
you would take a picture of a vulpix and (56:25 - 56:28)
then oak would come up and he would be (56:27 - 56:29)
like (56:28 - 56:31)
you were close or he would be like (56:29 - 56:32)
wonderful and then that was it (56:31 - 56:35)
right you you and then he remembered it (56:32 - 56:37)
and there were 63 pokemon and then you (56:35 - 56:38)
had an album where you could (56:37 - 56:41)
hold like 40 photos and that was it so (56:38 - 56:43)
you can do 40 favorites no matter what (56:41 - 56:44)
and then (56:43 - 56:46)
the best ones from oak and the best one (56:44 - 56:47)
was always going to be mu because mu was (56:46 - 56:48)
always worth the most points so once you (56:47 - 56:50)
took a picture of mu it would surpass (56:48 - 56:51)
everything else (56:50 - 56:54)
uh and then that and then in this game (56:51 - 56:57)
they do this actually really clever (56:54 - 56:58)
thing and this was one of the things i (56:57 - 57:01)
was worried about is like how do you (56:58 - 57:03)
how do you expand on the first pokemon (57:01 - 57:04)
snap it's a (57:03 - 57:06)
pretty basic game it's like you take the (57:04 - 57:08)
picture it's good or bad you move on if (57:06 - 57:09)
it's (57:08 - 57:11)
if it's if it's good like at a certain (57:09 - 57:13)
point earlier this week when i played (57:11 - 57:14)
pokemon snap (57:13 - 57:17)
i got the best dragonite picture they're (57:14 - 57:18)
like (57:17 - 57:20)
at by best i mean the best score you (57:18 - 57:22)
could possibly get on dragons four stars (57:20 - 57:24)
yeah it was it was 4 200 points and i (57:22 - 57:26)
looked it up online because there's (57:24 - 57:28)
fan-made online leaderboards of like (57:26 - 57:30)
and it's all dominated by incredible (57:28 - 57:32)
japanese players of like here's how they (57:30 - 57:33)
and then they (57:32 - 57:34)
it's it's cool it's like a fan-made site (57:33 - 57:36)
but it shows uh pokemon snap all the (57:34 - 57:37)
high scores (57:36 - 57:39)
and then some of them have pictures so (57:37 - 57:40)
you could be like wow how did you get (57:39 - 57:41)
your dratini picture that high and then (57:40 - 57:42)
you click on it and you see there's two (57:41 - 57:43)
dratini and you're like whoa i didn't (57:42 - 57:45)
even know i could get you two dratini (57:43 - 57:47)
in original pokemon snap but then you (57:45 - 57:48)
see where they did it and you're like oh (57:47 - 57:50)
i want to reproduce that (57:48 - 57:52)
so in the old pokemon snap like when i (57:50 - 57:53)
got the best (57:52 - 57:57)
dragonite picture i've had zero reason (57:53 - 57:57)
to ever (57:57 - 57:59)
focus or look at dr like i literally (57:57 - 58:00)
couldn't get a better picture of (57:59 - 58:01)
dragonite (58:00 - 58:04)
um that oak would would say and (58:01 - 58:05)
the entire time they announced this game (58:04 - 58:07)
i was like how are they going to expand (58:05 - 58:08)
on that because at a certain point like (58:07 - 58:09)
once you get a picture of vulpix what (58:08 - 58:11)
are you going to do you can but they do (58:09 - 58:12)
this thing where they have (58:11 - 58:14)
it's kind of confusing though and i kind (58:12 - 58:16)
of don't like how they did it (58:14 - 58:19)
but it's one two three (58:16 - 58:22)
and four stars but the stars the four (58:19 - 58:23)
star (58:22 - 58:26)
isn't better than the one star oh (58:23 - 58:29)
yeah they're different poses different (58:26 - 58:30)
poses and then (58:29 - 58:33)
in the stars you can get bronze silver (58:30 - 58:34)
gold and then (58:33 - 58:36)
i think the last one's either platinum (58:34 - 58:38)
or diamond it's diamond i believe (58:36 - 58:42)
so you so you have a way to so every (58:38 - 58:45)
pokemon you need four pictures of (58:42 - 58:46)
so the star thing's a little confusing (58:45 - 58:47)
because when people are watching they're (58:46 - 58:48)
like oh (58:47 - 58:50)
four star must be the best and it's like (58:48 - 58:51)
no it's just not composed it's a (58:50 - 58:52)
different pose (58:51 - 58:54)
so that's a i don't know how else you (58:52 - 58:55)
like (58:54 - 58:58)
yeah so there is like one star is them (58:55 - 58:59)
just existing (58:58 - 59:01)
two stars them existing plus three stars (58:59 - 59:03)
them existing plus doing like an attack (59:01 - 59:06)
and four star is is them doing something (59:03 - 59:08)
out of the ordinary or surprising (59:06 - 59:10)
and you have to catch one of each that (59:08 - 59:12)
brings me to one of my complaints (59:10 - 59:17)
is you can only select one picture out (59:12 - 59:20)
of the folder so if you got a one star a (59:17 - 59:20)
three star (59:20 - 59:24)
and a four star you can't pick one out (59:20 - 59:24)
of the one (59:24 - 59:27)
one out of three oh i swear before you (59:24 - 59:28)
have to just pick (59:27 - 59:30)
one which forces you to go back to (59:28 - 59:32)
recapture a picture of a one side that (59:30 - 59:33)
you already did (59:32 - 59:36)
and i i find that somewhat frustrating (59:33 - 59:37)
because i'm like (59:36 - 59:39)
i have one for each category of this (59:37 - 59:40)
pokemon (59:39 - 59:43)
just let me select them because they all (59:40 - 59:45)
go into a different spot (59:43 - 59:47)
why am i only allowed to pick one (59:45 - 59:48)
picture (59:47 - 59:52)
that that is that is that is when the (59:48 - 59:52)
game (59:52 - 59:54)
showed to me the grind and that's that (59:52 - 59:56)
was like my first like (59:54 - 60:00)
oh come on i have different categories (59:56 - 60:03)
of this pokemon like i i i didn't (60:00 - 60:04)
consider that but i can see that as a (60:03 - 60:05)
complaint (60:04 - 60:09)
that that is one of my complaints (60:05 - 60:12)
is i want to be able to submit multiple (60:09 - 60:13)
photos (60:12 - 60:15)
of a pokemon that i caught in different (60:13 - 60:16)
poses (60:15 - 60:19)
at the same time instead of having to go (60:16 - 60:20)
back (60:19 - 60:23)
and do that again i would say maybe (60:20 - 60:27)
to play devil's advocate the the (60:23 - 60:30)
okay thing that comes from that is like (60:27 - 60:32)
when i went through the the the reef (60:30 - 60:33)
level (60:32 - 60:35)
i think it is where squirtle and (60:33 - 60:37)
sharpito were there (60:35 - 60:38)
um that was like the first time i saw (60:37 - 60:40)
squirtle and (60:38 - 60:42)
sharpito's actually in quote too many (60:40 - 60:44)
levels but (60:42 - 60:46)
i i took a picture of the squirtle and (60:44 - 60:48)
then um (60:46 - 60:50)
when i was done it's that was the first (60:48 - 60:51)
pictures of squirtle (60:50 - 60:53)
it said one star and it was just like (60:51 - 60:54)
squirtle um (60:53 - 60:57)
standing there and then it three star (60:54 - 60:59)
was squirtle like getting eaten (60:57 - 61:03)
by sharpedo and my three star was really (60:59 - 61:04)
bad (61:03 - 61:07)
it was awful but the cool thing was like (61:04 - 61:09)
i know that that's how i get three star (61:07 - 61:10)
now (61:09 - 61:11)
so like that was like the good thing (61:10 - 61:13)
that i saw from it (61:11 - 61:16)
pokemon violence but that does a lot in (61:13 - 61:17)
this game (61:16 - 61:19)
that doesn't stop you from making the (61:17 - 61:20)
choice to go back and take a better (61:19 - 61:21)
three star (61:20 - 61:23)
like yeah that's true it takes that (61:21 - 61:25)
choice away from you (61:23 - 61:27)
i just knew that like this picture is (61:25 - 61:28)
bad and i'm going to do the level (61:27 - 61:30)
anyways but now i know how to get the (61:28 - 61:31)
three stars so that's the positive i saw (61:30 - 61:32)
from it but i see the point you're (61:31 - 61:33)
making (61:32 - 61:35)
so i mean that's that i think that's (61:33 - 61:37)
probably (61:35 - 61:39)
my biggest knock against the game is (61:37 - 61:41)
like you can only look at one picture of (61:39 - 61:43)
one pokemon from each folder (61:41 - 61:46)
like you you fly through rating them at (61:43 - 61:48)
the speed of light thankfully (61:46 - 61:51)
after you do your anime glasses evil (61:48 - 61:53)
glasses (61:51 - 61:56)
uh pose uh i i do find (61:53 - 61:59)
that to me was like don't don't show me (61:56 - 62:00)
the grind let me (61:59 - 62:03)
like grade it so that i know that that (62:00 - 62:04)
was a good idea but you've been playing (62:03 - 62:05)
video games for 50 (62:04 - 62:07)
some years it's very easy for you to (62:05 - 62:09)
discover where the grind is and (62:07 - 62:11)
like you know what i mean like yeah i (62:09 - 62:12)
mean i'm i've been (62:11 - 62:14)
already certain for the first five or (62:12 - 62:16)
six years video games did not (62:14 - 62:20)
exist no i got pong (62:16 - 62:24)
in what 76 (62:20 - 62:27)
no again (62:24 - 62:31)
there are again i said it's a minor (62:27 - 62:32)
complaint but it is (62:31 - 62:34)
a is a point when the game shows its (62:32 - 62:36)
grind it's a point when you're like (62:34 - 62:40)
why are you making me choose i think the (62:36 - 62:43)
i think the other i like (62:40 - 62:45)
gosh this is not a complaint it might (62:43 - 62:47)
seem like it though (62:45 - 62:48)
i have not looked anything up for this (62:47 - 62:51)
game and (62:48 - 62:53)
thankfully my twitch community is very (62:51 - 62:54)
awesome and they're very nice and they (62:53 - 62:55)
understand that (62:54 - 62:57)
i don't want to be told how to get (62:55 - 62:58)
something done (62:57 - 63:00)
so i would say this is something we (62:58 - 63:02)
haven't talked about yet pokemon snap is (63:00 - 63:03)
a puzzle game (63:02 - 63:05)
yeah and there are things that you have (63:03 - 63:08)
to do to line up and some of them kind (63:05 - 63:08)
of (63:08 - 63:11)
can be difficult because they don't (63:08 - 63:11)
exactly (63:11 - 63:15)
explain what you need to do in order to (63:11 - 63:16)
get a good picture (63:15 - 63:20)
like i have probably taken 500 pictures (63:16 - 63:21)
of buffaland (63:20 - 63:23)
because i love buffalo and i got a lot (63:21 - 63:25)
of buffalo butt pictures (63:23 - 63:27)
i got the one star the two star and the (63:25 - 63:28)
three star and i have them all in (63:27 - 63:30)
diamond or platinum or whatever like the (63:28 - 63:32)
best pictures you can get for them (63:30 - 63:35)
i have not figured out how to get (63:32 - 63:37)
whatever the four star they want from (63:35 - 63:38)
boofland and i'm sure i just could look (63:37 - 63:40)
it up i'm sure somebody figured out i'm (63:38 - 63:41)
sure within the first hour of the game (63:40 - 63:43)
somebody figured it out (63:41 - 63:47)
so like the grind for me (63:43 - 63:48)
wasn't necessarily what greg said the (63:47 - 63:50)
grind for me was like restarting that (63:48 - 63:51)
buffalo (63:50 - 63:53)
level time and time again and like (63:51 - 63:54)
playing the music and throwing the (63:53 - 63:56)
apples and throwing the illuminati and (63:54 - 63:57)
being like (63:56 - 64:01)
i don't know what needs to trigger this (63:57 - 64:02)
i don't know what it is (64:01 - 64:04)
and i might no i might be in the wrong (64:02 - 64:06)
area maybe he only does the four star (64:04 - 64:08)
during the day and i'm doing it at night (64:06 - 64:11)
and i'll never get it um (64:08 - 64:14)
and i believe in you but but i i like (64:11 - 64:14)
the (64:14 - 64:17)
i like that puzzle instance but at a (64:14 - 64:18)
certain point (64:17 - 64:19)
like the game doesn't give you any (64:18 - 64:21)
feedback of like (64:19 - 64:23)
what you are doing right or wrong right (64:21 - 64:24)
um (64:23 - 64:26)
and it's just a lot of trial and error (64:24 - 64:27)
like when you see a hair cross and you (64:26 - 64:28)
throw an apple and he doesn't do (64:27 - 64:29)
anything and you're like throwing an (64:28 - 64:30)
illuminati (64:29 - 64:31)
naughty ball and he doesn't do anything (64:30 - 64:33)
and you probably saw you throw like 30 (64:31 - 64:35)
apples at a poor sneezing (64:33 - 64:39)
turloin yeah get bogged mean yeah i (64:35 - 64:40)
bonked the heck out of that for a long (64:39 - 64:42)
time but i think about that (64:40 - 64:44)
was the same thing like i threw a bunch (64:42 - 64:46)
of apples that didn't do anything i (64:44 - 64:47)
played the music you didn't wake up (64:46 - 64:49)
like i threw the illuminati orb it just (64:47 - 64:50)
kept sleeping and (64:49 - 64:53)
that cause that's that that i can see be (64:50 - 64:54)
frustrating of like (64:53 - 64:55)
i don't know what i'm supposed to do (64:54 - 64:57)
here uh and the game doesn't give you (64:55 - 65:00)
any fee and like feedback maybe (64:57 - 65:03)
at a certain point mir or rita will step (65:00 - 65:04)
in and they'll suggest something i (65:03 - 65:07)
i haven't really paid so i have noticed (65:04 - 65:09)
that (65:07 - 65:13)
some of the potential four stars are (65:09 - 65:17)
hinted to in the requests that they make (65:13 - 65:19)
so there's that list of like hey get a (65:17 - 65:20)
picture of this (65:19 - 65:24)
um and some of my four stars that i have (65:20 - 65:25)
managed to get (65:24 - 65:27)
were because i was trying to get the (65:25 - 65:29)
picture that they were asking for (65:27 - 65:33)
um so there's a little hint but not (65:29 - 65:36)
a lot uh because there's a lot (65:33 - 65:38)
of requests up there that's a secondary (65:36 - 65:40)
complaint that i have (65:38 - 65:42)
um that request board is like (65:40 - 65:43)
overwhelming sometimes the request (65:42 - 65:46)
is overwhelming you in order to get (65:43 - 65:49)
credit for it like you can't have just (65:46 - 65:50)
taken the picture you have to show the (65:49 - 65:53)
pictures to the professor sometimes (65:50 - 65:55)
so you'll get a choice of do i fulfill (65:53 - 65:56)
the request (65:55 - 65:59)
or do i get the better photo and i don't (65:56 - 66:01)
even know if i'm fulfilling the request (65:59 - 66:04)
uh so there's there are some things that (66:01 - 66:05)
i like (66:04 - 66:07)
for as much as the game explains to at (66:05 - 66:08)
the beginning i (66:07 - 66:10)
kind of wish they explained other things (66:08 - 66:11)
more because you are sort of (66:10 - 66:15)
in the puzzle dark wondering i don't (66:11 - 66:17)
why did i get research credit for that i (66:15 - 66:19)
took the picture (66:17 - 66:21)
oh but i didn't show it to the professor (66:19 - 66:23)
so therefore i don't get (66:21 - 66:24)
credit for it even though it's in my (66:23 - 66:26)
folders (66:24 - 66:30)
i sh why are you not giving it so (66:26 - 66:32)
in those ways i'm like this is a little (66:30 - 66:33)
bit of a frustrating experience because (66:32 - 66:36)
i'm forced to make (66:33 - 66:40)
weird choices for different reasons in (66:36 - 66:41)
the game (66:40 - 66:45)
uh and i i struggle with that a little (66:41 - 66:46)
bit i mean it's good that like the (66:45 - 66:47)
research stuff (66:46 - 66:49)
does give rewards and it gives me (66:47 - 66:51)
rewards that i want which is usually (66:49 - 66:53)
unlocking stickers and things to alter (66:51 - 66:55)
my photos with so i kind of want to do (66:53 - 66:56)
those things (66:55 - 66:58)
um but i had to also because i was (66:56 - 67:00)
getting frustrated when i was playing on (66:58 - 67:01)
saturday to be like i just need to get (67:00 - 67:03)
through levels to unlock things (67:01 - 67:05)
so i see new pokemon i got to stop (67:03 - 67:06)
focusing on this because i'm getting (67:05 - 67:09)
frustrated with the lack of guidance i'm (67:06 - 67:11)
getting frustrated with having to redo (67:09 - 67:14)
levels and not understanding where this (67:11 - 67:16)
event is supposed to happen (67:14 - 67:19)
so i'm going to move on um are these the (67:16 - 67:21)
research tasks that you were talking (67:19 - 67:21)
about before (67:21 - 67:24)
okay yeah they show up so on like your (67:21 - 67:26)
main screen you have like three buttons (67:24 - 67:27)
on the left (67:26 - 67:29)
and then you have um like it's i think (67:27 - 67:31)
it's the y button in the upper right (67:29 - 67:32)
and it will say research tests and when (67:31 - 67:34)
you first start the game and you like (67:32 - 67:35)
drop that down (67:34 - 67:37)
there's like 20 of them it's like take a (67:35 - 67:39)
picture of a blossom take a picture of a (67:37 - 67:42)
the torterra find a square bunny uh get (67:39 - 67:43)
different vivi (67:42 - 67:46)
like there's a bunch yeah but you don't (67:43 - 67:47)
like you (67:46 - 67:50)
there's not a huge incentive to do them (67:47 - 67:51)
unless you just like to unlock like (67:50 - 67:54)
badges or like icons like they don't (67:51 - 67:54)
really (67:54 - 67:56)
do anything specific specifically more (67:54 - 67:58)
stickers to add to your photos (67:56 - 68:00)
they give you like stickers or frames or (67:58 - 68:02)
which i like titles because i (68:00 - 68:05)
need my online approval of my (68:02 - 68:07)
instagram account you need your what (68:05 - 68:08)
sweet but sweet awards what are they (68:07 - 68:11)
called sweet (68:08 - 68:11)
but then when you first connect to (68:11 - 68:14)
online this is this is the problem i (68:13 - 68:16)
have with it i don't have a problem with (68:14 - 68:16)
them telling me like (68:16 - 68:20)
hey take a picture of modern vivian when (68:16 - 68:21)
you connect online all of a sudden that (68:20 - 68:23)
starts filling up with like (68:21 - 68:27)
online stuff oh dlc no it's just like (68:23 - 68:29)
yeah so and so snap the new photo check (68:27 - 68:30)
it out and it's like (68:29 - 68:32)
no i don't get out of here i don't want (68:30 - 68:33)
to see that like if i want to check it (68:32 - 68:35)
out i'll go to the online one i'll i'll (68:33 - 68:37)
look at it all at the same time (68:35 - 68:40)
the online though is is better than (68:37 - 68:40)
expected (68:40 - 68:43)
it is uh they have put me over the edge (68:40 - 68:44)
to buy the game (68:43 - 68:46)
they have um actually you know what (68:44 - 68:47)
we'll we'll take a break (68:46 - 68:49)
and then we'll talk about the online (68:47 - 68:51)
stuff okay because i think (68:49 - 68:54)
that if you're slightly competitive or (68:51 - 68:54)
you (68:54 - 68:56)
have friends who are also playing the (68:54 - 68:58)
game i think that (68:56 - 69:00)
that social link makes the game very (68:58 - 69:01)
cool (69:00 - 69:07)
yeah i agree (69:01 - 69:19)
[Music] (69:07 - 69:22)
oh (69:19 - 69:22)
[Music] (69:22 - 69:42)
and we are back from our break (69:43 - 69:49)
before we talk about online stuff uh we (69:46 - 69:49)
re (69:49 - 69:53)
launched the patreon it's all (69:49 - 69:57)
did up uh so very exciting we've had the (69:53 - 69:58)
patreon for (69:57 - 70:01)
almost six years which is mind-blowing (69:58 - 70:01)
to me (70:01 - 70:03)
and over the six years i've like (70:01 - 70:05)
slightly tweaked and changed the rewards (70:03 - 70:07)
and took away things that worked and (70:05 - 70:09)
added things that i thought would work (70:07 - 70:14)
um but i overhauled all the rewards (70:09 - 70:17)
um and acted like we're (70:14 - 70:18)
launching a patreon for the very first (70:17 - 70:20)
time and i think the rewards are really (70:18 - 70:21)
great (70:20 - 70:24)
so um it starts at five dollars and five (70:21 - 70:25)
dollars will get you (70:24 - 70:28)
uh ad free version of the podcast it (70:25 - 70:29)
will get you (70:28 - 70:32)
access to slack it will get you two (70:29 - 70:33)
bonus (70:32 - 70:35)
podcast episodes a month which is (70:33 - 70:36)
probably the biggest thing that people (70:35 - 70:37)
want (70:36 - 70:40)
usually that the complaint is i wish (70:37 - 70:41)
your shows were longer or i wish you did (70:40 - 70:43)
more shows so this is your way of (70:41 - 70:43)
getting (70:43 - 70:47)
more shows um and then right now we're (70:43 - 70:48)
running a special offer (70:47 - 70:50)

be able to digitally download (70:59 - 71:02)
um if you sign up for the patreon and (71:00 - 71:04)
that'll be done probably before the end (71:02 - 71:05)
of the month and then you'll just be (71:04 - 71:06)
able to download it and if you (71:05 - 71:08)
back the kickstarter stuff that's more (71:06 - 71:10)
music you can add to the collection but (71:08 - 71:12)
i know the break music goes over really (71:10 - 71:14)
well so we want to do that seasonally (71:12 - 71:18)
so this will be like the spring (71:14 - 71:19)
technically it's not summer yet so this (71:18 - 71:22)
would be like the spring season (71:19 - 71:24)

interested in that patreon.com (71:35 - 71:42)
pcamencast uh or just ise.cash that (71:39 - 71:43)
works too but (71:42 - 71:44)
if you have any questions or you've (71:43 - 71:46)
never signed up for patreon or you're (71:44 - 71:47)
very curious (71:46 - 71:49)
uh feel free to let me know you can (71:47 - 71:51)
message me on discord or (71:49 - 71:54)
twitter or instagram i guess you can dm (71:51 - 71:56)
me there if you want to but yeah yeah (71:54 - 71:58)
instagram all the time all the time (71:56 - 72:00)
instagram is where it's at (71:58 - 72:02)
yeah it's a hot happening instagram even (72:00 - 72:04)
though it's technically just facebook (72:02 - 72:04)
messenger (72:04 - 72:08)
but we'll pretend it's not it's not it's (72:04 - 72:11)
very different but i'm super excited (72:08 - 72:13)
that we relaunched it (72:11 - 72:15)
again if you have any questions feel (72:13 - 72:16)
free to reach out (72:15 - 72:18)
um best time to sign up is the beginning (72:16 - 72:19)
of the month because patreon always (72:18 - 72:20)
charges at the first of the month so (72:19 - 72:22)
like if you sign up for patreon on like (72:20 - 72:23)
the 29th (72:22 - 72:24)
then you'll get charged in the 29th and (72:23 - 72:25)
then you get charged in the first so (72:24 - 72:27)
this is the best time to sign up (72:25 - 72:29)
um and if you don't like it if you (72:27 - 72:31)
decide that you're not using the premium (72:29 - 72:31)
feed (72:31 - 72:34)
you don't like the bonus episodes any of (72:31 - 72:35)
that stuff (72:34 - 72:36)
you just cancel any time it's pretty (72:35 - 72:39)
easy you could literally even ask for a (72:36 - 72:40)
refund if you get five dollars and you (72:39 - 72:42)
didn't feel like it was worth like (72:40 - 72:44)
you can just get your five bucks back uh (72:42 - 72:45)
it's totally cool (72:44 - 72:48)
also we're doing a brand new thing uh (72:45 - 72:50)
right now it's gonna be like the 25 (72:48 - 72:52)
tier just because we need to limit (72:50 - 72:54)
people and i don't know how much of a (72:52 - 72:56)
disaster it will be but we'll be doing (72:54 - 73:00)
um like a live group podcast (72:56 - 73:03)
so the 25 dollars gets you into that um (73:00 - 73:05)
because people want to be on the show um (73:03 - 73:06)
and some people want to (73:05 - 73:08)
give input to the show but without using (73:06 - 73:10)
a microphone so obviously you'll be able (73:08 - 73:12)
uh discord has like a new sound stage (73:10 - 73:13)
feature so people (73:12 - 73:17)
it's almost like clubhouse or um (73:13 - 73:19)
facebook rooms i think that's called (73:17 - 73:21)
it's like this new type of audio (73:19 - 73:22)
but if you want to be a part of that (73:21 - 73:24)
we'll pick a topic every month (73:22 - 73:27)
it'll be you come in uh you can either (73:24 - 73:29)
opt to raise your head it's almost like (73:27 - 73:31)
a call-in show opt to raise your hand (73:29 - 73:32)
and then we answer the call (73:31 - 73:33)
and then you either ask a question or (73:32 - 73:35)
you give your feedback and that'll be a (73:33 - 73:37)
cool thing we're trying so we're trying (73:35 - 73:37)
that this month (73:37 - 73:40)
um that's going to be for the 25 tier (73:37 - 73:42)
and if it works (73:40 - 73:43)
we'll keep doing it if it doesn't work i (73:42 - 73:45)
will completely scrap that and move on (73:43 - 73:47)
to different content but (73:45 - 73:49)
i know people want you know their voices (73:47 - 73:50)
heard they want to be part of the show (73:49 - 73:51)
so (73:50 - 73:53)
that'll be um that'll be something we're (73:51 - 73:54)
trying this month i'm really excited to (73:53 - 73:55)
try it out and (73:54 - 73:56)
get to hang out with you guys and talk (73:55 - 73:59)
to you guys because i talk a lot on the (73:56 - 73:59)
show (73:59 - 74:01)
and i'm sure you guys shake your hand (73:59 - 74:03)
and yell at your (74:01 - 74:05)
car stereo as you drive down the highway (74:03 - 74:08)
about how (74:05 - 74:11)
i what they actually do (74:08 - 74:13)
is they write to me and greg on (74:11 - 74:14)
instagram (74:13 - 74:17)
to complain about you yeah they do and (74:14 - 74:18)
then we're like totally (74:17 - 74:20)
here's the link to the lawsuit you know (74:18 - 74:22)
sometimes people write in (74:20 - 74:25)
and they they they yell at me that you (74:22 - 74:27)
guys are too gay (74:25 - 74:29)
and i don't know if they think because (74:27 - 74:30)
like (74:29 - 74:34)
like like i'm going to agree with them (74:30 - 74:36)
uh they have probably emailed you (74:34 - 74:37)
because they (74:36 - 74:39)
approached us first and got an earful so (74:37 - 74:41)
believe me we get plenty of those (74:39 - 74:45)
i don't even know what that means (74:41 - 74:47)
it's it's it's the they're the worst (74:45 - 74:49)
emails and i'm very glad when i tell (74:47 - 74:51)
those people off never to listen to my (74:49 - 74:54)
show again (74:51 - 74:54)
you can't see it on the audience in the (74:55 - 74:58)
audio version greg almost spit out his (74:57 - 75:01)
face (74:58 - 75:01)
uh anyways pokemon snap pokemon section (75:04 - 75:12)
um (75:09 - 75:12)
i found the subsequent roots lacking (75:13 - 75:20)
the leaderboard stuff is better than i (75:18 - 75:21)
thought it was going to be (75:20 - 75:25)
yes absolutely kicking your butt (75:21 - 75:27)
the the initial problem i normally have (75:25 - 75:29)
with leaderboards is it's usually easily (75:27 - 75:30)
gamed at some sys (75:29 - 75:31)
in some ways and then you know the (75:30 - 75:33)
leaderboard is just the same like (75:31 - 75:34)
picture the same whatever (75:33 - 75:36)
a million times and you know it is what (75:34 - 75:39)
it is uh but they have a cool option (75:36 - 75:41)
where you can just switch to friends (75:39 - 75:43)
so i have like 65 friends that bought (75:41 - 75:45)
pokemon snap bunch of suckers (75:43 - 75:48)
uh but i can i can see where they rank (75:45 - 75:49)
and (75:48 - 75:51)
based off the score we talked about (75:49 - 75:52)
earlier i can kind of gauge how much (75:51 - 75:55)
they've played or how far they are (75:52 - 75:58)
in the game um which like now i'm kind (75:55 - 75:59)
of stressed about because i'm not (75:58 - 76:00)
playing today (75:59 - 76:03)
and i was like ranked like 15 out of 65 (76:00 - 76:04)
people and i don't know (76:03 - 76:08)
the day's not over (76:04 - 76:08)
if you don't care about the ranking at (76:16 - 76:19)
all the game lets you (76:17 - 76:22)
upload six photos and these are photos (76:19 - 76:23)
that you can (76:22 - 76:25)
uh put stickers on write a little (76:23 - 76:27)
caption for (76:25 - 76:29)
and you can upload six photos at a time (76:27 - 76:30)
and once it's uploaded (76:29 - 76:34)
you can get two sweets on your photos (76:30 - 76:35)
so somebody can look at your photo and (76:34 - 76:37)
it's just like an instagram like they (76:35 - 76:38)
can hit the little a button to like your (76:37 - 76:39)
photo (76:38 - 76:42)
and then you get little sweet metals and (76:39 - 76:44)
if you get enough sweet metals your (76:42 - 76:46)
photo gets seen by more people which is (76:44 - 76:49)
a better chance it's literally instagram (76:46 - 76:51)
and you get a better chance of getting (76:49 - 76:52)
more (76:51 - 76:56)
sweet likes and (76:52 - 76:59)
it's both it is like the good (76:56 - 77:02)
part of instagram but also the bad part (76:59 - 77:03)
of instagram (77:02 - 77:06)
because you'll put work into a photo and (77:03 - 77:08)
you'll be like wow this is really funny (77:06 - 77:08)
i'm (77:08 - 77:10)
so clever hahaha this is gonna get a (77:08 - 77:11)
million sweets and then it gets like (77:10 - 77:13)
five sweets and you're like what did i (77:11 - 77:14)
do wrong (77:13 - 77:17)
so here's the thing i don't know what (77:14 - 77:18)
that experience is like (77:17 - 77:20)
because all of mine are banging gold (77:18 - 77:22)
well no no no greg (77:20 - 77:25)
it's i i i watched this happen (77:22 - 77:29)
on the stream steve (77:25 - 77:32)
is you know okay do you know that (77:29 - 77:33)
episode of seinfeld (77:32 - 77:36)
where costanza's like i'm going to do (77:33 - 77:38)
absolutely everything the opposite of (77:36 - 77:39)
like i normally do (77:38 - 77:40)
and then i'll be successful and it (77:39 - 77:42)
turned out when he did the opposite of (77:40 - 77:43)
everything he normally did (77:42 - 77:46)
does he was successful this is you steve (77:43 - 77:47)
yeah (77:46 - 77:50)
you literally put up the happy birthday (77:47 - 77:51)
tan growth (77:50 - 77:54)
which was an amazing photo (77:51 - 77:56)
and you said this photo's not going to (77:54 - 77:58)
get any likes this one's dumb look at (77:56 - 77:58)
this other (77:58 - 77:59)
tango and like literally there was (77:58 - 78:02)
another tang growth photo that was awful (77:59 - 78:04)
it was literally terrible and you're (78:02 - 78:05)
like oh that one's so much better than (78:04 - 78:06)
mine (78:05 - 78:08)
and then you put up happy birthday tan (78:06 - 78:10)
growth and it's like it's all the sweet (78:08 - 78:14)
likes um (78:10 - 78:14)
a great photo and it's like you (78:15 - 78:20)
it's you you stand in the way of your (78:18 - 78:23)
own success exactly i put up solid gold (78:20 - 78:24)
every time (78:23 - 78:27)
my my tank growth which (78:24 - 78:31)
is popular amongst my peoples (78:27 - 78:33)
they have reached out to me here comes (78:31 - 78:35)
the emails they have cut they've reached (78:33 - 78:37)
out to me through instagram and other (78:35 - 78:40)
other messages to say how much they've (78:37 - 78:42)
enjoyed it and laughed (78:40 - 78:46)
uh i put it up where about i knew it was (78:42 - 78:48)
i knew it was solid gold to me (78:46 - 78:50)
this is the problem is i'm getting in my (78:48 - 78:53)
own head (78:50 - 78:53)
you you don't know how to run your own (78:55 - 78:59)
sweet gram (78:58 - 79:02)
i i don't the rest of us are like i'm a (78:59 - 79:03)
social media failure (79:02 - 79:06)
i will say so the good thing that they (79:03 - 79:07)
do with the game we want to point this (79:06 - 79:10)
out is (79:07 - 79:10)
for whatever reason they figured out on (79:10 - 79:13)
this online (79:12 - 79:16)
this time if you haven't gotten to the (79:13 - 79:16)
level (79:16 - 79:19)
that the person posted a picture of it (79:16 - 79:20)
doesn't appear to you (79:19 - 79:24)
it's and it will say (79:20 - 79:26)
hey this is going to show you stuff that (79:24 - 79:28)
you haven't discovered yet (79:26 - 79:31)
are you okay with that and why they got (79:28 - 79:31)
it right (79:31 - 79:33)
in this game it's incredible it's (79:31 - 79:36)
incredible it's amazing i'm like (79:33 - 79:39)
this is how how did you know to (79:36 - 79:42)
how how did you get it right you fail at (79:39 - 79:43)
everything else (79:42 - 79:46)
but this one aspect is so good oh (79:43 - 79:48)
because bandai namco right there (79:46 - 79:50)
yeah it's crazy because like okay so for (79:48 - 79:51)
those that (79:50 - 79:54)
don't know what's happening um so there (79:51 - 79:56)
there are 200 some pokemon in the game (79:54 - 79:58)
and some pokemon are limited to specific (79:56 - 79:59)
courses right (79:58 - 80:02)
like like um spoiler charges in the game (79:59 - 80:06)
uh i think that was a given uh they they (80:02 - 80:07)
definitely showed like venusaur and i (80:06 - 80:09)
think they should blast toys in like the (80:07 - 80:10)
trailers but they never showed charizard (80:09 - 80:11)
but (80:10 - 80:14)
come on it's charizard but i didn't get (80:11 - 80:15)
charizard until (80:14 - 80:17)
like 12 hours of playing the game like (80:15 - 80:19)
he's pretty deep in the game and it's (80:17 - 80:21)
not even the first like two times you do (80:19 - 80:22)
the level it's like the third time he (80:21 - 80:24)
appears and you're like whoa charizard's (80:22 - 80:25)
here that's (80:24 - 80:27)
actually it's like it's exciting i think (80:25 - 80:28)
to me it was like exciting to see (80:27 - 80:30)
charizard finally (80:28 - 80:33)
but if somebody went to the volcano (80:30 - 80:33)
level (80:33 - 80:36)
and i'm not there yet well even even if (80:33 - 80:38)
i went to the volcano level and i played (80:36 - 80:39)
through it and they they went to the (80:38 - 80:41)
volcano level and they took a picture of (80:39 - 80:43)
charizard even though i did the volcano (80:41 - 80:45)
level and even though charizard is there (80:43 - 80:48)
but i haven't seen him yet when i go (80:45 - 80:50)
online and i look at like greg's photos (80:48 - 80:53)
it'll have like a big x through it and (80:50 - 80:55)
it'll be grayed out (80:53 - 80:59)
and i don't know which pokemon that is (80:55 - 81:02)
and if i click on it i can say like i'm (80:59 - 81:04)
okay with seeing that pokemon and it's (81:02 - 81:05)
crazy (81:04 - 81:08)
because it's just a charizard right like (81:05 - 81:11)
like it is not anything that you're like (81:08 - 81:13)
oh is it a brand new pokemon is it a (81:11 - 81:14)
legendary (81:13 - 81:17)
did they add like a it is just charizard (81:14 - 81:19)
i or i went to my friend (81:17 - 81:22)
uh catherine and she was like i really (81:19 - 81:23)
want you to check out this photo i think (81:22 - 81:24)
you would love it and i was like oh i (81:23 - 81:25)
haven't gotten there yet i don't know (81:24 - 81:26)
what pokemon it is (81:25 - 81:28)
and i was like you know what like i'm (81:26 - 81:29)
i'm going to do it because i haven't (81:28 - 81:31)
done it yet i want to see what it is and (81:29 - 81:33)
i clicked it and it was fruitish (81:31 - 81:34)
and it was like too frillish holding (81:33 - 81:36)
like little fins and it was very cute (81:34 - 81:38)
and she did like really cute hearts on (81:36 - 81:40)
it and stuff um (81:38 - 81:43)
and it was like how did you nail this so (81:40 - 81:46)
good like you have made me like you're (81:43 - 81:46)
not (81:46 - 81:50)
spoiling a frilish but also like (81:46 - 81:52)
it's kind of like will's complaints (81:50 - 81:53)
about um (81:52 - 81:55)
sword and shield like when you it was (81:53 - 81:57)
like you were kind of scared to do raid (81:55 - 81:58)
battles because you're like oh (81:57 - 82:00)
like you're using a stone journey and i (81:58 - 82:02)
didn't know that was a pokemon yet (82:00 - 82:04)
um and i i was kind of confused on like (82:02 - 82:06)
where you were coming from when you were (82:04 - 82:07)
like that because it's like well if you (82:06 - 82:08)
watch the anime you see pokemon early if (82:07 - 82:10)
you play the trading card game (82:08 - 82:13)
you might see like the game (82:10 - 82:14)
chooses when to show you pokemon but (82:13 - 82:16)
with the raid battle stuff like (82:14 - 82:17)
oh they can just bring eternities in and (82:16 - 82:18)
that might be your first right down (82:17 - 82:19)
there (82:18 - 82:23)
yeah yeah um but (82:19 - 82:26)
the fact that they like like they don't (82:23 - 82:28)
want to show you pokemon like (82:26 - 82:31)
from earlier in the game is just a super (82:28 - 82:32)
nice feature (82:31 - 82:34)
and it's like and then you can also (82:32 - 82:35)
choose (82:34 - 82:37)
for yourself whether you want to spoil (82:35 - 82:38)
it or not (82:37 - 82:41)
i think that the fact that they put that (82:38 - 82:42)
in (82:41 - 82:45)
in that choice seeing that (82:42 - 82:47)
that again seeing that section of the (82:45 - 82:50)
game is what prompted me to go release (82:47 - 82:52)
the mouse and go by the game (82:50 - 82:56)
like that that part made it like okay (82:52 - 82:59)
yeah i'm gonna go buy this game and i'm (82:56 - 83:01)
gonna go do it tonight because i was (82:59 - 83:02)
gonna wait till saturday when i had to (83:01 - 83:03)
run errands (83:02 - 83:04)
but i was like okay i'm gonna go do it (83:03 - 83:06)
tonight because i they did the online (83:04 - 83:07)
stuff (83:06 - 83:10)
so well and it's so nice to be able to (83:07 - 83:10)
sort (83:10 - 83:13)
by my friends and i can look at what the (83:10 - 83:14)
pictures they're taking (83:13 - 83:15)
and i don't have to worry about the (83:14 - 83:17)
general public and their dumb comments (83:15 - 83:19)
or their dumb captions (83:17 - 83:21)
and i can make things for my friends (83:19 - 83:24)
that my friends will get and find funny (83:21 - 83:28)
and they can easily find it it's not (83:24 - 83:31)
hidden it's not in a morass of a million (83:28 - 83:31)
people (83:31 - 83:34)
it is i can sort to my friends and i can (83:31 - 83:35)
find it (83:34 - 83:39)
and that part is so well done that that (83:35 - 83:41)
that literally convinced me to buy the (83:39 - 83:42)
game yeah (83:41 - 83:45)
the the online the the only weird part (83:42 - 83:47)
about the online it's such a minor (83:45 - 83:47)
complaint (83:47 - 83:51)
is that if you wa if you have (83:47 - 83:54)
if you're if you're in the album you can (83:51 - 83:56)
edit a photo and then if you go to (83:54 - 83:57)
upload it it will yell at you that you (83:56 - 83:59)
have too many so you have to back back (83:57 - 84:00)
out (83:59 - 84:01)
go down to the internet go into there (84:00 - 84:03)
then delete it then go back into album (84:01 - 84:05)
to hit the upload that's the only (84:03 - 84:06)
complaint is like (84:05 - 84:08)
those those should be you're limited to (84:06 - 84:10)
six and if you haven't filled up it's (84:08 - 84:10)
kind of a (84:10 - 84:12)
problem so you have to like delete (84:10 - 84:14)
before you plan to upload otherwise it's (84:12 - 84:17)
gonna yell at you um (84:14 - 84:21)
but man like the it's (84:17 - 84:21)
it's such another part of the game that (84:21 - 84:24)
you can completely ignore (84:22 - 84:27)
and still get your value out of (84:24 - 84:30)
but it's part of the reason why (84:27 - 84:33)
i haven't unlocked every level yet i (84:30 - 84:34)
think there's a snow level i haven't (84:33 - 84:35)
unlocked (84:34 - 84:38)
i would be surprised if there wasn't and (84:35 - 84:40)
there's a lot of snow pokemon (84:38 - 84:42)
but yeah it was like you i would i would (84:40 - 84:43)
take (84:42 - 84:44)
i would take a bunch of pictures and (84:43 - 84:45)
then i would be like okay these are (84:44 - 84:47)
going to these are going to go to mirror (84:45 - 84:48)
and he's going to be like (84:47 - 84:51)
hmm wow nice shot wow (84:48 - 84:53)
and then when i when i look through i (84:51 - 84:55)
always want to look through (84:53 - 84:57)
even when i'm done because i was like oh (84:55 - 84:58)
these might make good (84:57 - 85:00)
online things and then it's like oh i (84:58 - 85:01)
think this (85:00 - 85:04)
this photo has too sweet potential but (85:01 - 85:06)
uh so i'm gonna save it and i'm gonna (85:04 - 85:08)
come back to it later (85:06 - 85:12)
and it's it's so good it is (85:08 - 85:14)
uh i want to point out another thing (85:12 - 85:17)
because we touched on it a little bit (85:14 - 85:20)
um the judging criteria in this game is (85:17 - 85:23)
way better than the original snap (85:20 - 85:25)
the fact that that was that was a (85:23 - 85:27)
prediction that has been proven false (85:25 - 85:28)
because steve was like (85:27 - 85:29)
oh you're just going to get the pokemon (85:28 - 85:31)
in the middle of the photo and he's (85:29 - 85:32)
going to say (85:31 - 85:35)
that's wonderful and move on the fact (85:32 - 85:38)
that direction is a category (85:35 - 85:41)
facing or not facing the camera is its (85:38 - 85:42)
own separate category so (85:41 - 85:44)
even if you can only see the back of (85:42 - 85:46)
something you still (85:44 - 85:49)
get a decent (85:46 - 85:49)
you can still get a decent score like (85:49 - 85:52)
that (85:51 - 85:54)
that criteria is one of them but there's (85:52 - 85:56)
a lot of other criteria and that (85:54 - 85:59)
that really made the scoring feel more (85:56 - 86:01)
dynamic to me like you're not just (85:59 - 86:02)
saying (86:01 - 86:05)
it's only i mean granted i agree with (86:02 - 86:06)
some (86:05 - 86:09)
i agree professor mir isn't interested (86:06 - 86:10)
in your art (86:09 - 86:12)
professor mirror likes only what he (86:10 - 86:15)
likes don't get artsy with it get artsy (86:12 - 86:16)
for your friends (86:15 - 86:18)
what was the title of that article it's (86:16 - 86:20)
like pokemon snap does not watch your (86:18 - 86:22)
avant-garde photography (86:20 - 86:23)
i'll find it again cause it made me (86:22 - 86:26)
laugh so hard he um (86:23 - 86:29)
so it makes sense in a lower lower sense (86:26 - 86:30)
like he doesn't (86:29 - 86:31)
he doesn't care about the rule of thirds (86:30 - 86:33)
he wants to be who wants the pokemon in (86:31 - 86:35)
the center of the picture (86:33 - 86:37)
uh he wants the full pokemon and he (86:35 - 86:38)
doesn't want a close-up of justin's face (86:37 - 86:39)
he wants the full pokemon center the (86:38 - 86:40)
picture because he's using it for (86:39 - 86:41)
research (86:40 - 86:43)
research all right here's the title (86:41 - 86:44)
here's the article title that made me (86:43 - 86:45)
laugh (86:44 - 86:47)
new pokemon snap doesn't want your (86:45 - 86:52)
avant-garde photography (86:47 - 86:52)
so it it it makes sense (86:52 - 86:58)
yes that that that happens so they did (86:55 - 86:59)
they (86:58 - 87:02)
they took away some things that oak used (86:59 - 87:03)
to do and then they added some new (87:02 - 87:03)
things (87:03 - 87:06)
so in the original pokemon snap it would (87:03 - 87:06)
be (87:06 - 87:10)
it would be um whether there's a special (87:06 - 87:12)
bonus that would be the number one and (87:10 - 87:13)
that wouldn't always appear but like (87:12 - 87:16)
oak will be like wow well pikachu on a (87:13 - 87:17)
stump (87:16 - 87:19)
that's worth at least 14 000 points or (87:17 - 87:20)
he'll be like (87:19 - 87:24)
whoa a pikachu riding an articuno that's (87:20 - 87:26)
never before seen 500 points he like (87:24 - 87:28)
there's a special category (87:26 - 87:32)
um and this game doesn't have that at (87:28 - 87:34)
uh which is kind of a bummer like (87:32 - 87:35)
there's no like (87:34 - 87:37)
like mirror at never point goes like (87:35 - 87:39)
whoa a murderer of (87:37 - 87:42)
murkrow and that that feels a little (87:39 - 87:43)
sterile in this game (87:42 - 87:46)
where he doesn't like he doesn't ever (87:43 - 87:47)
think anything is like (87:46 - 87:49)
more exciting than other things like (87:47 - 87:50)
it's a man of science (87:49 - 87:54)
he is a scientist do you like the facts (87:50 - 87:54)
about a pikachu on a stump and mir is (87:56 - 88:00)
like oh i (87:59 - 88:03)
just witnessed a graveler fault his (88:00 - 88:05)
demise but like he like doesn't care (88:03 - 88:07)
he's just like cool (88:05 - 88:10)
you did it the world of nature is (88:07 - 88:13)
cruel i said grandma to his death and i (88:10 - 88:14)
know it (88:13 - 88:17)
i didn't mean it come back grappler you (88:14 - 88:19)
like have like (88:17 - 88:21)
five marina eating of course la and mir (88:19 - 88:22)
was like (88:21 - 88:25)
nice shot actually moves on hey (88:22 - 88:27)
that's disturbing but we're gonna just (88:25 - 88:28)
move past this (88:27 - 88:31)
so it is a bit of a bummer that like (88:28 - 88:32)
there's none of that (88:31 - 88:34)
it's like small flavor of like mere (88:32 - 88:36)
reacting to things that (88:34 - 88:38)
seem interesting that oak used to so (88:36 - 88:39)
they got rid of the special and then (88:38 - 88:41)
it's it's like (88:39 - 88:44)
uh oak did size and then oak did like (88:41 - 88:45)
position (88:44 - 88:49)
and then he he he yeah technique they (88:45 - 88:49)
called it (88:49 - 88:51)
and then he added on if there were more (88:49 - 88:53)
than the same pokemon in so if there was (88:51 - 88:55)
two routine or three vulpix he would (88:53 - 88:56)
give you bonus points (88:55 - 88:57)
and then he would have like a times two (88:56 - 88:59)
if it was (88:57 - 89:01)
facing you or in the center or whatever (88:59 - 89:03)
and so they got rid of the times two (89:01 - 89:05)
they adjusted it so instead of like the (89:03 - 89:06)
same pokemon (89:05 - 89:08)
mirror is just like oh there are other (89:06 - 89:09)
pokemon here (89:08 - 89:10)
which is like nice if you took a picture (89:09 - 89:13)
of a cacnia and there's like a (89:10 - 89:15)
skroopy behind it he'll be like oh cool (89:13 - 89:17)
let's see it's a groupie (89:15 - 89:18)
so it does encourage you to get other (89:17 - 89:20)
pokemon in the photo (89:18 - 89:22)
um and then he broke down the what greg (89:20 - 89:24)
said the positioning and then the (89:22 - 89:25)
centering (89:24 - 89:28)
so positioning is (89:25 - 89:30)
wait is it it's positioning and it's (89:28 - 89:32)
centering right the direction (89:30 - 89:36)
direction and position well it's pose (89:32 - 89:39)
uh direction (89:36 - 89:43)
position seven categories (89:39 - 89:46)
yeah anyways one one is like completely (89:43 - 89:47)
center in the photo (89:46 - 89:49)
and then the other is like how straight (89:47 - 89:51)
on it's looking at you (89:49 - 89:52)
which can kind of be confusing because (89:51 - 89:55)
like i got a hundred pose with magikarp (89:52 - 89:57)
being like horizontal (89:55 - 89:59)
like seeing magikarp horizontal like (89:57 - 90:01)
it's not magikarp straight on (89:59 - 90:02)
which some pokemon it is straight on but (90:01 - 90:04)
with magikarp it was like completely (90:02 - 90:05)
horizontal so that can be a little (90:04 - 90:06)
confusing (90:05 - 90:08)
like so with with some pokemon like (90:06 - 90:10)
credidly you're like (90:08 - 90:13)
where is the front of you (90:10 - 90:16)
like your heart yeah well it's like it's (90:13 - 90:17)
symmetrical at the base (90:16 - 90:19)
it's just like his head wobbles around (90:17 - 90:21)
so you're just like where's the exact (90:19 - 90:22)
front of you (90:21 - 90:23)
so that's a little confusing and then (90:22 - 90:25)
size this is maybe the most confusing (90:23 - 90:26)
one (90:25 - 90:29)
size is the entire pokemon in the (90:26 - 90:30)
picture (90:29 - 90:32)
so like it's not how big the pokemon (90:30 - 90:34)
well it is how big the pokemon is but (90:32 - 90:34)
like (90:34 - 90:37)
if you're taking a picture of vivian he (90:34 - 90:38)
wants a hundred (90:37 - 90:40)
he wants to see the entire vivian all (90:38 - 90:43)
the vivillon in there yeah so if viva (90:40 - 90:45)
viviana is super close to you and its (90:43 - 90:46)
wings are cut off (90:45 - 90:48)
that's a smaller size because you're (90:46 - 90:50)
getting less of that vivian (90:48 - 90:53)
yeah so alolan exeggutor is not in this (90:50 - 90:54)
game (90:53 - 90:56)
yeah i mean you know i don't be on the (90:54 - 90:59)
one thing and i haven't found it yet (90:56 - 91:03)
um so yeah that's it it's the grading (90:59 - 91:05)
is better there are still points where (91:03 - 91:06)
you're like yeah (91:05 - 91:07)
i don't know what you're talking about (91:06 - 91:10)
man like i i get it but man this other (91:07 - 91:11)
photo's way better (91:10 - 91:14)
shift your shifter glasses but again he (91:11 - 91:16)
doesn't want ava guard photography he (91:14 - 91:17)
wants (91:16 - 91:20)
clinical scientific by the book (91:17 - 91:21)
photography (91:20 - 91:24)
none of your fanciness and then we can (91:21 - 91:25)
talk about the first like (91:24 - 91:28)
boss battle which is meganium yeah so (91:25 - 91:30)
when you do the park level (91:28 - 91:32)
it's like park during the day then park (91:30 - 91:33)
at night and then i think they want you (91:32 - 91:35)
to do park during the day one more time (91:33 - 91:38)
and then because it's different and then (91:35 - 91:40)
the it's called was it it's called like (91:38 - 91:43)
illuminati zone or something aluminized (91:40 - 91:46)
yeah so that opens up and then that (91:43 - 91:47)
takes you through (91:46 - 91:49)
it's a it's a shorter level i would say (91:47 - 91:51)
most levels are like two minutes long (91:49 - 91:53)
and this level is closer to like maybe a (91:51 - 91:55)
minute and a half (91:53 - 91:58)
and you can replay this level and this (91:55 - 92:00)
level has like a scoring (91:58 - 92:01)
so for example there's another boss (92:00 - 92:03)
later and when you're first doing that (92:01 - 92:05)
level you only see that boss and then (92:03 - 92:05)
when (92:05 - 92:06)
if you upgrade it from level one to (92:05 - 92:09)
level two you will see pokemon (92:06 - 92:12)
off to the sides in the first boss level (92:09 - 92:16)
yeah so you there is a reason i just (92:12 - 92:17)
don't i need to go back to the boss (92:16 - 92:18)
levels (92:17 - 92:19)
yeah i just don't know what spawns (92:18 - 92:21)
around meganium because i only did the (92:19 - 92:22)
meganium one like (92:21 - 92:25)
i do because i've done it twice what (92:22 - 92:26)
spawns around meganium (92:25 - 92:29)
uh evie comes and plays with meganium so (92:26 - 92:32)
evie rides meganium's back and runs (92:29 - 92:33)
around and does a bunch of (92:32 - 92:36)
uh stuff and they interact as friends (92:33 - 92:37)
yeah boy (92:36 - 92:39)
yeah boy but you're just you just like (92:37 - 92:40)
kind of follow me (92:39 - 92:43)
through the level except this time you (92:40 - 92:44)
follow meganium and evie through the (92:43 - 92:47)
level because evie runs around and (92:44 - 92:49)
interacts with you and eats fluff fruit (92:47 - 92:50)
and stuff and (92:49 - 92:54)
later bosses you have to like (92:50 - 92:56)
so meganium is really straightforward (92:54 - 92:57)
you can just keep taking pictures of (92:56 - 92:58)
meganium and then (92:57 - 93:00)
meganium's glowing with the illuminati (92:58 - 93:02)
and then if you throw them of pester (93:00 - 93:02)
balls (93:02 - 93:03)
not pester balls they'll get rid of that (93:02 - 93:05)
if you throw the illuminati (93:03 - 93:09)
balls then it will glow even more (93:05 - 93:11)
um in later bosses and i don't want to (93:09 - 93:12)
spoil what they are (93:11 - 93:15)
um like one of them is in the water and (93:12 - 93:15)
when you (93:15 - 93:18)
you have to hit it with an apple and (93:15 - 93:19)
then it comes (93:18 - 93:21)
out of the water and then you have to (93:19 - 93:22)
illuminate it (93:21 - 93:24)
itself it's not like the the meganium is (93:22 - 93:25)
like easy mode (93:24 - 93:28)
yeah so like you have to and you have to (93:25 - 93:30)
illuminate it to the point where it's (93:28 - 93:31)
like (93:30 - 93:34)
overflowing with illuminati because when (93:31 - 93:37)
when in in the in the water level when (93:34 - 93:38)
the pokemon (93:37 - 93:39)
i don't want to spoil it when the (93:38 - 93:41)
pokemon comes out of the water and i (93:39 - 93:42)
threw the illuminati ball (93:41 - 93:45)
and then i took a picture because it was (93:42 - 93:46)
glowing (93:45 - 93:47)
and i was like okay we're good and then (93:46 - 93:49)
i got to the end of the level and that (93:47 - 93:50)
was like the one time mirror yells at (93:49 - 93:51)
you (93:50 - 93:52)
and he's like you didn't get any photos (93:51 - 93:54)
and you're like what are you i took 70 (93:52 - 93:55)
what are you talking about (93:54 - 93:58)
i've maxed out my memory card and then (93:55 - 93:59)
he's like you didn't take any photos and (93:58 - 94:00)
they didn't really make it clear but you (93:59 - 94:01)
have to hit it (94:00 - 94:04)
at least i had to hit it twice because i (94:01 - 94:04)
was like (94:04 - 94:07)
apple you're out of the water illuminati (94:04 - 94:09)
ball you're glowing snap snap snap snap (94:07 - 94:11)
snap okay you went back in the water (94:09 - 94:13)
um and it was glowing and you could see (94:11 - 94:14)
in the picture it was (94:13 - 94:16)
glowing but it wasn't there's like a (94:14 - 94:18)
there's like levels of illuminati so (94:16 - 94:19)
like after the second ball (94:18 - 94:22)
he's now like push he's like pushing out (94:19 - 94:23)
that energy and that's the (94:22 - 94:25)
that's the snap he wanted so you're (94:23 - 94:27)
saying it's masculine (94:25 - 94:30)
it's again the legend it's crazy how (94:27 - 94:31)
many basklin there are (94:30 - 94:34)
is the masculines all the way down (94:31 - 94:37)
um (94:34 - 94:37)
the game is very good yeah i mean so (94:38 - 94:44)
i have more pros than cons i do have a (94:42 - 94:45)
couple of (94:44 - 94:48)
cons one is i can't select multiple (94:45 - 94:48)
pictures (94:48 - 94:51)
my other con is a lot of the times i (94:48 - 94:52)
feel (94:51 - 94:56)
that the controls are sludgy (94:52 - 95:00)
that they feel they feel unnecessarily (94:56 - 95:01)
slow (95:00 - 95:04)
uh and the fact that i can't start or (95:01 - 95:06)
stop my stupid machine (95:04 - 95:08)
like just let me stop my machine or (95:06 - 95:10)
speed up my machine (95:08 - 95:11)
just like that there is a speed up (95:10 - 95:13)
function near the end yeah which was on (95:11 - 95:15)
the first pokemon snap (95:13 - 95:18)
there's not a stop i have to like (95:15 - 95:20)
convince a pokemon to come get hit by my (95:18 - 95:22)
car so it stops so i can (95:20 - 95:25)
stop for a minute on the thing uh (95:22 - 95:28)
but i i do find the (95:25 - 95:32)
controls sometimes very i feel there are (95:28 - 95:33)
a couple of times where i felt the (95:32 - 95:34)
controls were fighting against me and (95:33 - 95:37)
i'm like just let me (95:34 - 95:40)
center and turn around (95:37 - 95:41)
and get everything and there's not like (95:40 - 95:43)
an easy button now (95:41 - 95:44)
i mean that's the difference if you want (95:43 - 95:45)
to turn around real fast you can (95:44 - 95:47)
actually use the d-pad (95:45 - 95:50)
yeah yeah like but like (95:47 - 95:54)
they can it just feels unnecessarily (95:50 - 95:55)
sludgy sometimes (95:54 - 95:57)
uh and that's just for listeners i (95:55 - 95:59)
thought it felt very slow but just a (95:57 - 96:02)
tip and greg knows this but you can use (95:59 - 96:03)
both sticks (96:02 - 96:04)
um so if you're like looking to the left (96:03 - 96:06)
with the left stick (96:04 - 96:08)
and then you use the right stick you can (96:06 - 96:10)
push also to the left and you can go (96:08 - 96:10)
faster (96:10 - 96:12)
right there's like settings that you can (96:10 - 96:14)
go into to like increase the (96:12 - 96:16)
mouse cursor speed yeah but it doesn't (96:14 - 96:17)
feel like it actually works (96:16 - 96:18)
it doesn't feel like it does anything (96:17 - 96:20)
you like crank it up like (96:18 - 96:22)
you like crank it all the way up and (96:20 - 96:24)
you're like this like it gives i think (96:22 - 96:26)
it starts at three it's like three out (96:24 - 96:26)
of ten (96:26 - 96:28)
yeah and i went to ten out of ten and i (96:26 - 96:29)
was like nothing changed (96:28 - 96:31)
exchange i bet seven out of ten like (96:29 - 96:33)
this is exactly the same the thing is (96:31 - 96:35)
that when you do the double switch it (96:33 - 96:36)
uncenters things and you have to try to (96:35 - 96:38)
ride them up again and (96:36 - 96:40)
and the controls are sometimes just (96:38 - 96:42)
kludgy that way the controls feel (96:40 - 96:44)
sometimes clutchy when you're trying to (96:42 - 96:45)
add (96:44 - 96:49)
uh stickers to photos like i feel like (96:45 - 96:50)
there could have been a bit more (96:49 - 96:52)
smoothness in the controls again all my (96:50 - 96:54)
complaints are really minor (96:52 - 96:57)
i think like i think the the levels feel (96:54 - 96:58)
a little grindy (96:57 - 97:00)
it's not a bad thing if you like it or (96:58 - 97:02)
if you're really just wanting to be in (97:00 - 97:02)
there (97:02 - 97:04)
i think the controls feel a little (97:02 - 97:05)
clutchy (97:04 - 97:07)
and i think they over explained at the (97:05 - 97:09)
beginning and under explain (97:07 - 97:11)
what they want at later times when (97:09 - 97:13)
you're trying to get pokemon problems (97:11 - 97:13)
like (97:13 - 97:16)
yeah i'm completely lost what do you (97:13 - 97:17)
want me to do (97:16 - 97:21)
i don't understand um did i even explain (97:17 - 97:22)
like (97:21 - 97:24)
i guess they kind of do like like if if (97:22 - 97:25)
you (97:24 - 97:27)
like professor mir kept yelling at me (97:25 - 97:28)
not yelling at me but (97:27 - 97:30)
there's like a certain point where he's (97:28 - 97:31)
like you should do the reef and you (97:30 - 97:33)
should look for a glowing flower (97:31 - 97:36)
right and but they don't explain this (97:33 - 97:38)
it's such a dumb thing though like (97:36 - 97:40)
again they don't they they over explain (97:38 - 97:41)
and then underexplain (97:40 - 97:45)
so i didn't realize it was the (97:41 - 97:47)
i think it was the park level he was (97:45 - 97:49)
like look for a glowing flower and i was (97:47 - 97:50)
like oh cool found it (97:49 - 97:54)
and then i found it but like and then i (97:50 - 97:56)
didn't think of taking a picture of it (97:54 - 97:57)
and then i went through the level again (97:56 - 97:59)
and he was like yeah you need to find (97:57 - 98:00)
the glowing flower finally (97:59 - 98:02)
i've done this i found it and i took a (98:00 - 98:04)
picture of it because i didn't select (98:02 - 98:06)
the glowing flower to show him yeah yeah (98:04 - 98:06)
that was the other (98:06 - 98:08)
he didn't except like it was in the (98:06 - 98:09)
folders (98:08 - 98:11)
so he was right there he was like find a (98:09 - 98:12)
glowing flower and you're like you hit (98:11 - 98:13)
it (98:12 - 98:14)
with the illumi and then it's like i (98:13 - 98:16)
found it and then he's like (98:14 - 98:18)
find a glowing flower and you're like i (98:16 - 98:18)
don't know what you want to do so you (98:18 - 98:19)
take a picture of it (98:18 - 98:22)
and then he's like oh cool and then he (98:19 - 98:24)
was like find a glowing flower and (98:22 - 98:25)
you're like (98:24 - 98:28)
oh i have to sh i have to have to show (98:25 - 98:29)
you the picture (98:28 - 98:31)
of the flower getting your photography (98:29 - 98:32)
badge is (98:31 - 98:35)
understanding the technicalities of (98:32 - 98:36)
being a photographer (98:35 - 98:39)
they could explain that uh he could (98:36 - 98:41)
literally just say i need a picture of a (98:39 - 98:42)
glowing flower (98:41 - 98:45)
this is literally a game about taking (98:42 - 98:45)
photos (98:45 - 98:48)
for a professor if all of those pieces (98:45 - 98:50)
don't come together in your brain (98:48 - 98:52)
it's not the game that's broken it is (98:50 - 98:54)
the confusing thing is when you (98:52 - 98:56)
when you look for those that haven't (98:54 - 98:58)
played it when you but they're in there (98:56 - 98:58)
like wow (98:58 - 99:00)
maybe greg and steve are just really (98:58 - 99:02)
dumb which i i'll take (99:00 - 99:05)
taking photos for a professor okay but (99:02 - 99:06)
here's the thing (99:05 - 99:08)
so when you find the flower you have to (99:06 - 99:10)
hit the y button or the x button and (99:08 - 99:11)
then it does like a little (99:10 - 99:14)
scan thing and it scans it and then you (99:11 - 99:16)
have to hold your cursor over and then (99:14 - 99:18)
hold the x button and it fills up a (99:16 - 99:19)
gauge (99:18 - 99:21)
and when it fills up the gauge it's like (99:19 - 99:22)
scanned but that's (99:21 - 99:25)
and that what that in itself makes it (99:22 - 99:27)
think like oh i scanned it and that data (99:25 - 99:28)
went back to the paper (99:27 - 99:31)
certain things that you do scan they (99:28 - 99:32)
accept (99:31 - 99:35)
so it it like you could ex scan this and (99:32 - 99:37)
it's like oh cool you found that (99:35 - 99:40)
noted but this is one of those things (99:37 - 99:41)
where it's like okay i found it i (99:40 - 99:42)
scanned it (99:41 - 99:46)
and i took a picture of it why are you (99:42 - 99:49)
still telling me that i have to do it oh (99:46 - 99:51)
you didn't put an exclamation part on (99:49 - 99:52)
that folder to (99:51 - 99:54)
remind me to go into that folder and (99:52 - 99:55)
specifically fix pick (99:54 - 99:57)
that picture and then have you look at (99:55 - 100:00)
it like there's just little pieces that (99:57 - 100:01)
are left out and it's (100:00 - 100:04)
again minor complaints but it's like you (100:01 - 100:04)
spent (100:04 - 100:08)
4 000 years telling me how to point the (100:04 - 100:08)
camera (100:08 - 100:11)
you couldn't spend two seconds to say (100:08 - 100:14)
make sure you show me a picture of it (100:11 - 100:17)
one line of dialogue it's very weird (100:14 - 100:20)
um um i think (100:17 - 100:24)
i think the game looks (100:20 - 100:27)
beautiful i think all the pokemon look (100:24 - 100:30)
incredible i think they move so (100:27 - 100:36)
fluidly and so naturally and so (100:30 - 100:39)
comfort it's just comfortable to watch (100:36 - 100:41)
them you don't feel stressed watching (100:39 - 100:42)
it's a very (100:41 - 100:44)
zen game it's like watching uh mutual of (100:42 - 100:45)
omaha (100:44 - 100:48)
yeah all of those things i'm like yeah (100:45 - 100:52)
this is a good game uh (100:48 - 100:52)
i still feel a little on the fence (100:53 - 100:57)
because the grind about the price (100:55 - 101:00)
point but again (100:57 - 101:02)
if you i don't think that i don't think (101:00 - 101:05)
the price point is a big enough barrier (101:02 - 101:07)
to not get the game i think there's (101:05 - 101:08)
enough positives about the game to buy (101:07 - 101:09)
the game (101:08 - 101:11)
i have minor complaints but i i think (101:09 - 101:14)
the fact that i have minor complaints (101:11 - 101:17)
is is a boon to the game i thought the (101:14 - 101:19)
i thought the negative of the game was (101:17 - 101:21)
going to be it's too short (101:19 - 101:22)
i thought we i thought i was going to (101:21 - 101:24)
come into this podcast this week and be (101:22 - 101:24)
like (101:24 - 101:26)
pokemon snap is incredible it's super (101:24 - 101:28)
fun i had a smile on my face the entire (101:26 - 101:29)
time (101:28 - 101:31)
by the way it's five hours long that's (101:29 - 101:33)
what i thought i was going to say (101:31 - 101:36)
yeah like i never in the lead up to this (101:33 - 101:37)
game (101:36 - 101:40)
and they showed the same levels (101:37 - 101:42)
the same pokemon in all of these (101:40 - 101:43)
trailers (101:42 - 101:45)
and then they showed that boring (101:43 - 101:47)
corporate six minute trailer of like (101:45 - 101:50)
that that trailer so ruined the game (101:47 - 101:53)
yeah it was awful like that (101:50 - 101:55)
that seemed like something that was like (101:53 - 101:58)
internal to like nintendo staff of like (101:55 - 102:00)
all right here's that somehow i ended up (101:58 - 102:01)
on the youtube channel (102:00 - 102:03)
like some intern just hit the button it (102:01 - 102:04)
was like oh well it's out like (102:03 - 102:06)
hey hey we're selling pokemon snap in (102:04 - 102:08)
two weeks here's all the bullet points (102:06 - 102:10)
in a six minute trailer so when people (102:08 - 102:13)
call in to my nintendo support you can (102:10 - 102:16)
recite the like it was such a bad (102:13 - 102:18)
youtube video i don't know why they put (102:16 - 102:20)
it out yeah it's bad (102:18 - 102:22)
so like hearing like this game only has (102:20 - 102:24)
200 pokemon (102:22 - 102:25)
if you've already played the first (102:24 - 102:27)
pokemon snap uh (102:25 - 102:29)
like i thought i was gonna say (102:27 - 102:30)
everything i was i thought i was gonna (102:29 - 102:32)
come into the show and be like (102:30 - 102:35)
i love this game i had amazing time (102:32 - 102:37)
i don't know if it's i don't know if 60 (102:35 - 102:39)
is worth like five hours of content (102:37 - 102:41)
the but the fact that i'm 20 hours in (102:39 - 102:43)
i'm halfway through the pokedex (102:41 - 102:45)
i'm so excited to go back there are (102:43 - 102:47)
levels i i need to unlock (102:45 - 102:49)
i've only done three boss fights and i (102:47 - 102:50)
think there's (102:49 - 102:54)
a couple more i have not (102:50 - 102:56)
i haven't unlocked levels i haven't gone (102:54 - 102:58)
back to some levels i haven't maxed out (102:56 - 102:59)
my research (102:58 - 103:03)
i i i want to try to (102:59 - 103:06)
diamond slash platinum everything (103:03 - 103:08)
because i i think that is fun and (103:06 - 103:10)
and i think it is doable like once you (103:08 - 103:11)
figure out like (103:10 - 103:14)
i will say watching irene beat your (103:11 - 103:16)
score on some pictures last night (103:14 - 103:19)
was pure joy yeah and she was like it (103:16 - 103:21)
was so weird for her going through like (103:19 - 103:24)
i'm so bad at this game and then like (103:21 - 103:26)
being like oh i just got 4 (103:24 - 103:28)
500 points on this picture like it's (103:26 - 103:29)
there there is (103:28 - 103:31)
like you don't have to be good at it (103:29 - 103:33)
like the game's scoring is pretty (103:31 - 103:35)
generous in spots yeah but it's just (103:33 - 103:37)
like fine tweaking but like sometimes (103:35 - 103:39)
you just happen to (103:37 - 103:41)
click the shutter at the right time and (103:39 - 103:42)
you got a good photo (103:41 - 103:44)
and it's as simple as that like just aim (103:42 - 103:45)
at a (103:44 - 103:47)
score bunny and just keep taking photos (103:45 - 103:49)
and one of them will be good like (103:47 - 103:52)
it'll it'll be fine um so yeah it was it (103:49 - 103:54)
was cool watching her play and just (103:52 - 103:56)
like seeing how much joy she had even (103:54 - 103:57)
though i didn't tell (103:56 - 103:59)
i was like don't worry about this don't (103:57 - 104:00)
worry about the illuminati don't worry (103:59 - 104:01)
about the scans don't worry about the (104:00 - 104:03)
music just go through and (104:01 - 104:07)
she had a great time um there are (104:03 - 104:10)
some levels that feel kind of boring (104:07 - 104:12)
compared to others like there's an (104:10 - 104:14)
underwater level (104:12 - 104:16)
um and i think the reason the underwater (104:14 - 104:17)
level is kind of like (104:16 - 104:21)
meh is because by the time you get to it (104:17 - 104:23)
it's like oh there's finney on oh wow (104:21 - 104:24)
they remembered finneyon was a pokemon (104:23 - 104:26)
and put into this game (104:24 - 104:27)
and then there's like oh there's (104:26 - 104:29)
magikarp okay magikarp has been on (104:27 - 104:30)
almost every level (104:29 - 104:31)
oh here's love disc well i just saw love (104:30 - 104:33)
diss the last level (104:31 - 104:35)
uh here's the lumineon so like that (104:33 - 104:37)
level felt really like (104:35 - 104:39)
i guess credidley's new and i guess claw (104:37 - 104:40)
litters knew (104:39 - 104:43)
yeah it's when a level has repeat ones (104:40 - 104:44)
and you're only seeing (104:43 - 104:47)
a few new things that that it feels a (104:44 - 104:48)
little (104:47 - 104:51)
it feels a little bit not bad it just (104:48 - 104:52)
feels like it (104:51 - 104:55)
the excitement isn't as strong yeah and (104:52 - 104:57)
then you get to that volcano level for (104:55 - 105:00)
the first time oh my gosh i lost my mind (104:57 - 105:04)
whoever made that volcano level they're (105:00 - 105:05)
the best level programmer ever (105:04 - 105:08)
yeah the like pacing of that is is good (105:05 - 105:11)
it is like all new pokemon it is good (105:08 - 105:12)
pokemon (105:11 - 105:14)
they're the backgrounds are incredible (105:12 - 105:16)
like that volcano level is (105:14 - 105:18)
mind-blowing like the park when you (105:16 - 105:20)
first do the park level you're (105:18 - 105:21)
you're not really blown away because (105:20 - 105:23)
that's like the one they showed in the (105:21 - 105:23)
trailer (105:23 - 105:25)
and so you kind of see everything and (105:23 - 105:26)
then you go through it at night and (105:25 - 105:28)
you're like okay that's cool (105:26 - 105:29)
and then there's like a jungle level and (105:28 - 105:30)
you're like okay jungle level school you (105:29 - 105:32)
see the jungle level at night and then (105:30 - 105:34)
there's like three water levels in a row (105:32 - 105:36)
um by the way it took me like 12 hours (105:34 - 105:38)
to get the volcano level and i'm (105:36 - 105:40)
still having a great time and i'm still (105:38 - 105:41)
good and i we (105:40 - 105:43)
i get to the volcano level and i am like (105:41 - 105:45)
i i think i used all 70 photos and i (105:43 - 105:47)
wasn't even halfway through the level (105:45 - 105:49)
like i was like i had to stop taking (105:47 - 105:51)
pictures towards the end i'm like oh (105:49 - 105:53)
i'm nowhere near the exit and i'm down (105:51 - 105:55)
to nine pictures (105:53 - 105:58)
these last nine pictures have to count (105:55 - 106:03)
like that volcano level is incredible (105:58 - 106:05)
um i will say the spoiler spoiler (106:03 - 106:06)
spoiler i (106:05 - 106:09)
i was in the no column because my (106:06 - 106:11)
favorite pokemon is not in the game (106:09 - 106:13)
and that had pushed me in the no column (106:11 - 106:14)
because i was not going to buy (106:13 - 106:18)
out of protest because how dare you (106:14 - 106:20)
not have my favorite pokemon in this (106:18 - 106:21)
game yeah (106:20 - 106:25)
there is uh i guess this is our last (106:21 - 106:26)
talking point because we're going on (106:25 - 106:27)
really long (106:26 - 106:30)
there is such a good variety of pokemon (106:27 - 106:34)
and they didn't i personally don't care (106:30 - 106:34)
about this (106:34 - 106:36)
i know some people do there's always (106:34 - 106:38)
there's always going to be those vocal (106:36 - 106:41)
people that are like there's it's all a (106:38 - 106:42)
gen one pandering (106:41 - 106:44)
and there is your charizard there is (106:42 - 106:45)
your venusaur there is your squirtle (106:44 - 106:46)
there's your charmander there's your (106:45 - 106:47)
bubble star i don't think there's any (106:46 - 106:48)
middles of those (106:47 - 106:51)
um and i'm i'm 20 hours in i haven't (106:48 - 106:52)
seen venusaur yet but obviously venusaur (106:51 - 106:53)
was in the trailer (106:52 - 106:58)
um there those pokemon exist (106:53 - 107:00)
uh and there's like a pidgey pidgeot (106:58 - 107:01)
there's no pidgey (107:00 - 107:03)
uh and there there are gen one pokemon (107:01 - 107:05)
but man they picked some (107:03 - 107:08)
cool pokemon to be in this game like (107:05 - 107:08)
like (107:08 - 107:12)
archeops is in this game archeops like (107:08 - 107:14)
the the dumb fossil bird that can barely (107:12 - 107:15)
fly (107:14 - 107:17)
they put in this game and it does what (107:15 - 107:18)
you think it does (107:17 - 107:22)
it it looks like it it's so dumb looking (107:18 - 107:24)
and it tries to fly away from another (107:22 - 107:26)
pokemon and it panics and they like do (107:24 - 107:27)
the screeching (107:26 - 107:31)
it is like perfect and really good (107:27 - 107:35)
he is so cool to see um (107:31 - 107:38)
the like finian and lumineon are in this (107:35 - 107:38)
like (107:38 - 107:41)
what phinean is it like normally if it (107:38 - 107:43)
was any other pokemon game it would have (107:41 - 107:44)
been golden it would have been golden (107:43 - 107:46)
and seeking because for whatever reason (107:44 - 107:48)
the pokemon company loves putting gold (107:46 - 107:50)
they gave nessa goldeen (107:48 - 107:53)
for whatever like a brand new jenna the (107:50 - 107:53)
gym leader (107:53 - 107:56)
let's give her goldie like why it's such (107:53 - 107:57)
a boring fish (107:56 - 107:59)
there you have it you have goodies a (107:57 - 108:01)
thousand water type pokemon and you're (107:59 - 108:03)
gonna just rely on golden for (108:01 - 108:05)
like it is like refreshing that there is (108:03 - 108:06)
no golden but they put (108:05 - 108:09)
finney on and lumineon and it's like (108:06 - 108:10)
wild to me that (108:09 - 108:12)
some of the pokemon they decided to put (108:10 - 108:14)
in this game they picked a (108:12 - 108:19)
good mix from all the generations (108:14 - 108:22)
just they did they did a really good job (108:19 - 108:23)
uh (108:22 - 108:26)
apart from personally insulting me i (108:23 - 108:28)
have no other complaints (108:26 - 108:31)
about the dlc that's the dlc well there (108:28 - 108:32)
are (108:31 - 108:34)
potential dlcs i could see that (108:32 - 108:35)
happening (108:34 - 108:38)
uh i could see them adding to the game (108:35 - 108:39)
if they wanted (108:38 - 108:42)
i don't i would like a a (108:39 - 108:45)
level just for me (108:42 - 108:45)
the one thing i do think is weird though (108:46 - 108:49)
is (108:48 - 108:50)
in the very first level in the park (108:49 - 108:52)
level you see a grookie and uh square (108:50 - 108:54)
bunny (108:52 - 108:56)
um and the square bunny gets a lot of (108:54 - 108:57)
love in this game (108:56 - 109:00)
he is in like three other levels he's (108:57 - 109:01)
pretty much as (109:00 - 109:02)
if there's no water in the level he's (109:01 - 109:04)
he's showing up uh (109:02 - 109:07)
and grooky not as much uh but i (109:04 - 109:09)
i know sabal's in the game it is (109:07 - 109:11)
mind-blowing to me that like (109:09 - 109:15)
i haven't triggered sable yet uh which (109:11 - 109:16)
is (109:15 - 109:18)
weird because he's in the trailer (109:16 - 109:20)
shooting water on a venusaur (109:18 - 109:22)
but it's just a little it just feels a (109:20 - 109:25)
little lopsided that like (109:22 - 109:27)
square bunny is like right out the gate (109:25 - 109:29)
and grookie is also right out the gate (109:27 - 109:31)
and they were like yeah well sobel yeah (109:29 - 109:32)
we will get solve (109:31 - 109:36)
the puzzle solve the puzzle (109:32 - 109:36)
all right pokemon of the week let's wrap (109:38 - 109:42)
this up is appleton in the game because (109:40 - 109:45)
appleton's not in your room anymore (109:42 - 109:47)
uh appleton is not in the room right now (109:45 - 109:49)
i cannot confirm or deny if appleton is (109:47 - 109:51)
in the game (109:49 - 109:51)
i will say that there are other gen 8 (109:53 - 109:56)
pokemon (109:55 - 109:58)
but you have to they're near the end of (109:56 - 109:59)
the game (109:58 - 110:02)
uh interesting there's a there's a (109:59 - 110:04)
couple that i've seen (110:02 - 110:07)
which is yeah it is yeah there are (110:04 - 110:08)
there's some cool (110:07 - 110:11)
oh okay one last thing sorry this is (110:08 - 110:13)
this is my complaint greg complained (110:11 - 110:18)
they i am not one for storytelling (110:13 - 110:20)
either i gravitate to a story in a video (110:18 - 110:21)
game or i don't (110:20 - 110:24)
and you have a very short (110:21 - 110:26)
so like with destiny when i first played (110:24 - 110:27)
destiny i was like i love everything (110:26 - 110:29)
about destiny didn't like the story at a (110:27 - 110:30)
certain point the story clicked with me (110:29 - 110:32)
i went back and i wanted to experience (110:30 - 110:33)
the whole thing (110:32 - 110:35)
and no one is i don't think anyone is (110:33 - 110:37)
purchasing pokemon snap because they (110:35 - 110:39)
wanted a 60 (110:37 - 110:42)
amazing story coming out of it but in my (110:39 - 110:43)
opinion (110:42 - 110:47)
they do this thing where (110:43 - 110:49)
they are trying to tell a story about i (110:47 - 110:50)
remember his name it's captain vince (110:49 - 110:52)
because it's very kind of generic yeah (110:50 - 110:54)
and they're and they do this thing where (110:52 - 110:56)
they just write (110:54 - 110:58)
off the gate in my opinion assume that (110:56 - 110:59)
you (110:58 - 111:02)
care and they do nothing i do they do (110:59 - 111:03)
nothing to establish (111:02 - 111:05)
why you should care about captain vince (111:03 - 111:07)
because we all grew up (111:05 - 111:10)
on stories of captain vince yeah (111:07 - 111:13)
i mean and there's like a certain point (111:10 - 111:13)
like (111:13 - 111:16)
15 hours in where they're like here's a (111:13 - 111:18)
random picture of captain vince (111:16 - 111:20)
and they show captain vincent and they (111:18 - 111:22)
show a pokemon with captain vince (111:20 - 111:24)
and you're like well now i guess i kind (111:22 - 111:26)
of care because i know what he looks (111:24 - 111:27)
like and like (111:26 - 111:28)
like why didn't they just show that (111:27 - 111:30)
picture of the beginning like why they (111:28 - 111:32)
did you just didn't interpret the (111:30 - 111:34)
picture on the cover of the book (111:32 - 111:35)
they just they like kind of throw you (111:34 - 111:37)
into like we're doing this because (111:35 - 111:39)
captain vince found illuminati and we're (111:37 - 111:40)
trying to finish captain vince's thing (111:39 - 111:41)
and he (111:40 - 111:43)
and rita's like well captain vince (111:41 - 111:44)
didn't have any pictures they're all (111:43 - 111:45)
blurry (111:44 - 111:47)
and he's like yeah but but steve cares (111:45 - 111:49)
about captain vince and i was like (111:47 - 111:52)
bro i just got here off a train (111:49 - 111:56)
um what who is this rain (111:52 - 111:59)
what did you take to the islands (111:56 - 112:02)
geez it's just look i (111:59 - 112:04)
care about captain vince i've grown up (112:02 - 112:06)
my entire life (112:04 - 112:07)
hearing stories about the great captain (112:06 - 112:10)
vince and all of captain vince's (112:07 - 112:11)
incredible adventures (112:10 - 112:12)
they literally reminded me of that in (112:11 - 112:14)
the first minute of the game i (112:12 - 112:16)
realized that this may be a generational (112:14 - 112:18)
thing and you millennials (112:16 - 112:20)
don't care about captain vince anymore (112:18 - 112:23)
but when we were kids (112:20 - 112:25)
i mean i couldn't get enough captain (112:23 - 112:27)
ben's stories (112:25 - 112:29)
i'm sad that my parents got rid of my (112:27 - 112:30)
captain vince collection (112:29 - 112:33)
when i moved and went to college i mean (112:30 - 112:34)
it's heartbreaking and i have not been (112:33 - 112:36)
able to find those pieces (112:34 - 112:39)
since i've even friends with a person (112:36 - 112:42)
named vince in hopes of getting captain (112:39 - 112:44)
vince material (112:42 - 112:46)
the whole i thought the hope would be (112:44 - 112:47)
vince becomes the captain no (112:46 - 112:49)
i'd be like that's time that was not (112:47 - 112:51)
real no that's not gonna happen with (112:49 - 112:52)
that vince vince is not gonna become (112:51 - 112:53)
captain (112:52 - 112:56)
just i gave up on that (112:53 - 112:56)
question of the week we're not doing (112:57 - 113:01)
questions like it's too long oh yeah (112:59 - 113:03)
yeah sorry pokemon of the week (113:01 - 113:05)
all right take that slack no question (113:03 - 113:08)
for you (113:05 - 113:11)
so first off (113:08 - 113:11)
i have to admit i pulled the trick on (113:11 - 113:17)
everybody (113:14 - 113:19)
because i obviously the pokemon of the (113:17 - 113:22)
week last week was really short (113:19 - 113:23)
so i will read you the actual clue and (113:22 - 113:25)
then i will remind you of what the trick (113:23 - 113:26)
i pulled was (113:25 - 113:29)
so i said the clue was there are four (113:26 - 113:31)
pokemon games where you start the game (113:29 - 113:31)
when within (113:31 - 113:34)
a moving truck which pokemon is chasing (113:31 - 113:36)
the professor at the beginning of those (113:34 - 113:37)
games (113:36 - 113:39)
and then the trick was i interrupted (113:37 - 113:40)
myself and said (113:39 - 113:43)
wait greg were there five games where (113:40 - 113:44)
you start within a moving truck and greg (113:43 - 113:45)
said yes (113:44 - 113:50)
but the secret is (113:45 - 113:52)
in one of the five games the professor's (113:50 - 113:56)
being chased by a different pokemon (113:52 - 113:58)
and only in four of them is the (113:56 - 114:02)
professor being chased by (113:58 - 114:02)
who tell me it's (114:03 - 114:10)
chat shut up don't chase nobody (114:07 - 114:14)
no it's zigzagoon (114:10 - 114:18)
no craig (114:14 - 114:18)
in the four in the four it's (114:20 - 114:26)
puccieta pucciano one it's zigzague (114:23 - 114:28)
in emerald it's zigzag believe me people (114:26 - 114:31)

one of them's different and i'm like yes (114:31 - 114:36)
yes it's pushienna in four of them and (114:34 - 114:38)
zigzagoon and emerald the best game in (114:36 - 114:40)
the entire series (114:38 - 114:42)
possibly potentially i no not (114:40 - 114:45)
potentially they've never topped it (114:42 - 114:50)
yeah it's owen pooch hyena (114:45 - 114:53)

although potentially either more (116:42 - 116:50)
or fewer tricks involved (116:45 - 116:50)
out of my 659 instagram followers one (116:51 - 116:56)
recently commissioned a digital art (116:54 - 116:58)
piece by (116:56 - 117:01)
calgarian corsola of themselves (116:58 - 117:04)
as a pokemon gym leader in snow point (117:01 - 117:05)
city (117:04 - 117:08)

leader (117:08 - 117:11)
is ice type the picture depicts my (117:08 - 117:12)
follower (117:11 - 117:15)
as a normal type gym leader this week's (117:12 - 117:16)
pokemon (117:15 - 117:19)

this week's pokemon is one of the first (117:19 - 117:24)
three pokemon to appear when you begin (117:22 - 117:27)
playing the new pokemon snap and the (117:24 - 117:30)
only one that has not been featured as a (117:27 - 117:30)
starter in (117:30 - 117:33)
any pokemon game it is possible that (117:30 - 117:36)
this week's pokemon was excluded from (117:33 - 117:38)
the new snowpoint city gym (117:36 - 117:40)
because its evolution is actually weak (117:38 - 117:43)
to ice type attacks (117:40 - 117:44)
did you even pay attention when you (117:43 - 117:47)
first started playing pokemon snap (117:44 - 117:50)
