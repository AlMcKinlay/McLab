dollars and attempted to snatch stash (14:12 - 14:16)
them underneath a car in a parking lot (14:14 - 14:19)
new york state troopers stopped Smith (14:16 - 14:21)

reporter there sir what were you hoping (14:32 - 14:38)
to achieve by stealing 15 packs of (14:35 - 14:42)
hopefully they were fates collide uh sir (14:38 - 14:44)
what is the deck you are currently (14:42 - 14:46)
running and what cards did you plan on (14:44 - 14:49)

father an Umbreon Yanks Oh what local (14:49 - 14:57)
regional competition were you aiming for (14:53 - 15:03)
what cards are good now well I'm brioni (14:57 - 15:06)
X I know is what one of our slack dudes (15:03 - 15:10)
is trying to get um but I mean I know (15:06 - 15:16)
Vanguard carts ah 63 well you know when (15:10 - 15:18)
when you start the article saying that a (15:16 - 15:21)
man stole 15 poke 15 packs of pokemon (15:18 - 15:25)
cards you go all right like you know he (15:21 - 15:28)
had a set goal he had something in mind (15:25 - 15:29)
but then when you put the vet (15:28 - 15:33)
value of its only $63 where the cards (15:29 - 15:36)
you really second-guess his motive see (15:33 - 15:39)
my kid that's my that's why my question (15:36 - 15:41)
is how did it what was how was he trying (15:39 - 15:42)
to get away with them was it just as (15:41 - 15:44)
many as he could carry or did he go I (15:42 - 15:46)
feel like 15 is a good number that's (15:44 - 15:49)
what I'm gonna try and get away with my (15:46 - 15:51)
is that just how many you could put in (15:49 - 15:54)
his socks before he got out of there why (15:51 - 15:56)
didn't he steal yugioh cards or you know (15:54 - 15:58)
I gathering I feel like 15 is a good (15:56 - 16:04)
luck one handful there was a man for (15:58 - 16:08)
video participation Lee well dig hands (16:04 - 16:12)
man I feel like I mean well what do they (16:08 - 16:15)

the store online codes yeah maybe (16:43 - 16:53)
stealing digital pet pegs okay i so he's (16:47 - 16:54)
getting out of there with real physical (16:53 - 16:56)
cards do you think when he ran into the (16:54 - 16:59)

the tech industry they use the usually (19:02 - 19:06)

purchasing 101 pokemon jukebox if you (19:34 - 19:43)
didn't know what it did I it offered (19:40 - 19:47)
three songs uh it offered I think it was (19:43 - 19:50)
three songs for three days and then they (19:47 - 19:52)
would rotate out for different three (19:50 - 19:54)
songs that you can listen to free (19:52 - 19:55)
otherwise you could only listen to (19:54 - 19:57)
previews and then bye (19:55 - 19:59)

to a dollar twenty-nine a song I don't (19:59 - 20:03)
know if anyone actually went through (20:01 - 20:08)

least pokemon go footage showed off some (20:45 - 20:53)
pokemon evolution so I the video has (20:49 - 20:55)
since been pulled so I didn't actually (20:53 - 20:57)
watch the YouTube video how evolution (20:55 - 20:59)
has worked when we read a little bit (20:57 - 21:02)
from the article here in the new leaked (20:59 - 21:04)
footage which lasted about a minute the (21:02 - 21:07)
tester uses evolution that mean (21:04 - 21:10)
evolution shards to evolve an abra into (21:07 - 21:13)
Cadabra players collect evolution chards (21:10 - 21:16)
shards by catching pokemon of the same (21:13 - 21:17)
type meaning the trainer will need to do (21:16 - 21:19)
a bit of grinding in order to who would (21:17 - 21:21)
have thought a mobile game with grinding (21:19 - 21:24)
a Pokemon game with grinding who would (21:21 - 21:27)
have thought nude a bit of grinding in (21:24 - 21:29)
order to evolve their favorite pokemon (21:27 - 21:32)
of course this is a big deviation from (21:29 - 21:33)
normal pokemon games which use leveling (21:32 - 21:36)
up evolution storms and a few other (21:33 - 21:38)
techniques for evolving Pokemon I (21:36 - 21:42)
wishing stones yes okay you said storms (21:38 - 21:47)
the evolution storms when thunderous (21:42 - 21:51)
makes your jolteon evolved into a metric (21:47 - 21:56)
that that doesn't happen another Pokemon (21:51 - 21:59)
goes go news beta testers also notice (21:56 - 22:02)
some new variations to the x biomes (21:59 - 22:06)
biomes biodomes that determined what (22:02 - 22:08)
pokemon appear where some testers have (22:06 - 22:11)
speculated about the existence of rare (22:08 - 22:14)
rare spots which spawn rare and unusual (22:11 - 22:17)
pokémon similar to Pokemon goes gyms and (22:14 - 22:20)
pokey stops these these rare spots seem (22:17 - 22:22)
to be tied down to known landmarks and (22:20 - 22:24)
destinations other testers also recently (22:22 - 22:26)
noticed that the weather seemed to (22:24 - 22:28)
impact the spawn rate of pokemon during (22:26 - 22:31)
a recent rainstorm testers notice that (22:28 - 22:34)
water pokemon began to spawn in areas (22:31 - 22:37)
where urban pokemon like ratata and (22:34 - 22:41)
Magnemite usually appear well the slip (22:37 - 22:44)
Silk Road subreddit where if you are (22:41 - 22:47)
really if you're so excited for Pokemon (22:44 - 22:50)
go that you need consistent Pokemon good (22:47 - 22:52)
news i would suggest checking out that (22:50 - 22:58)
subreddit they have confirmed that that (22:52 - 23:00)
they confirmed exactly what i just said (22:58 - 23:03)
actually so i'm not going to repeat that (23:00 - 23:05)
pokemon go I still does not have a (23:03 - 23:08)
release date people are anticipating it (23:05 - 23:13)
coming this summer we've talked about (23:08 - 23:15)
Pokemon go a little bit here I don't (23:13 - 23:17)
know if we got in your opinions on (23:15 - 23:22)
Pokemon go Micah um I think I I can't (23:17 - 23:24)
remember I feel like i did my opinion (23:22 - 23:31)
has always been that I'm optimistically (23:24 - 23:35)
skeptical I guess is the best way to put (23:31 - 23:36)
it that's funny because I'm step (23:35 - 23:42)
skeptically optimistic I I am interested (23:36 - 23:45)
in it and I am it i will definitely be (23:42 - 23:48)
downloading it and playing it and (23:45 - 23:50)
everything but i don't i don't think (23:48 - 23:54)
that it's gonna necessarily be as (23:50 - 23:57)
amazing as everybody is hoping it's (23:54 - 23:59)
gonna be that's my opinion on it i think (23:57 - 24:03)
i think that there I've said before that (23:59 - 24:06)
there have been pokemon clones that have (24:03 - 24:09)
done this already to some extent (24:06 - 24:12)
obviously not with VR and it's not an (24:09 - 24:14)
official pokemon game so that makes a (24:12 - 24:19)
huge difference but they've existed and (24:14 - 24:22)
it hasn't been super interesting it's (24:19 - 24:24)
been really interesting for the first (24:22 - 24:25)
like (24:24 - 24:28)
you're four days and then that's pretty (24:25 - 24:31)
much it but if they can make it (24:28 - 24:34)
interesting enough that it retains that (24:31 - 24:37)
excitement over the course of you know (24:34 - 24:40)
months for me that that will be a big (24:37 - 24:44)
deal yeah I'm hoping that it being an (24:40 - 24:47)
official game gives lens some of that (24:44 - 24:51)
you know that excitement to it but yeah (24:47 - 24:52)
I think some people are going to be (24:51 - 24:54)
disappointed because they're over hyping (24:52 - 24:56)
there in their imagination what it's (24:54 - 24:59)
going to be and then some people will (24:56 - 25:01)
say well yeah it's not like the super (24:59 - 25:03)
supreme of what I wanted but it's still (25:01 - 25:05)
fun to play so I'm gonna just hang out (25:03 - 25:09)
and play it yeah but also come on Joey (25:05 - 25:13)
to where I don't see myself taking road (25:09 - 25:18)
trips to catch specific pokemon or (25:13 - 25:20)
anything like that you know like I don't (25:18 - 25:22)
I just I don't see that being maybe it (25:20 - 25:25)
it may be will be yeah it'll be a big (25:22 - 25:28)
thing but no you told me you only take (25:25 - 25:30)
one vacation a year so she'll just sit (25:28 - 25:34)
on polka was like oh I never what what (25:30 - 25:36)
about that bacon Birdman what if there's (25:34 - 25:39)
a bacon bird in the middle of my road (25:36 - 25:43)
and I gotta travel for it i mean i was i (25:39 - 25:47)
was on day one very impressed with me (25:43 - 25:50)
tomo and then i figured out how pretty (25:47 - 25:53)
shallow it is and the fact that in (25:50 - 25:55)
attendance just data mining you based (25:53 - 25:57)
off of like what's your favorite bread I (25:55 - 26:04)
don't know sourdough that's my no no no (25:57 - 26:07)
me tomo tailing there but it it runs (26:04 - 26:10)
very thin for me and obviously i've been (26:07 - 26:12)
on a clash royale kick and I could (26:10 - 26:14)
easily talk about clash Royale for an (26:12 - 26:17)
hour and that game is rotten with like (26:14 - 26:21)
timers and micro transactions but at the (26:17 - 26:24)
end of the day the reason I keep going (26:21 - 26:26)
back to clash Royale is because the (26:24 - 26:30)
actual game itself is really good yeah I (26:26 - 26:34)
like the PvP aspect of class rail and (26:30 - 26:38)
like I don't know like going to me tomo (26:34 - 26:38)
and fine (26:38 - 26:41)
being out that there's new boots or (26:38 - 26:43)
there's a cat suit I can purchase for a (26:41 - 26:46)
thousand gold is like not enough to go (26:43 - 26:50)
back and like keep going to it yes I see (26:46 - 26:53)
your me tomo you okay Steve you're going (26:50 - 26:56)

for talk about it I look challah french (27:00 - 27:09)
baguette like some sourdough tomato (27:06 - 27:14)
basil great breath by Cinco de Mayo joke (27:09 - 27:14)

what's your favorite my favorite bread (27:22 - 27:29)
oh I really like a good rye I have not a (27:25 - 27:31)
big fan all right well I feel like you (27:29 - 27:34)
have a weird favorite bread oh we ho ho (27:31 - 27:37)
it's what about honey wheat I like (27:34 - 27:38)
here's the thing though are we talking (27:37 - 27:41)
about bread this used in Sandwich format (27:38 - 27:43)
or just you're eating a piece of bread I (27:41 - 27:45)
can eat pretty much it's just a piece of (27:43 - 27:49)
bread other Pokemon are Shaymin no he's (27:45 - 27:52)
not a legendary he's a mythical mystical (27:49 - 27:57)
okay so the first two names that were (27:52 - 27:59)
trademarked were I'm gonna slaughter (27:57 - 28:05)
these names the sole Gail galiyo so (27:59 - 28:08)
Gallio ooh I like the way I said that (28:05 - 28:15)
Salah Holly oh so agua Sluggo s a legume (28:08 - 28:21)
gee al yo Gally oh that's what I just (28:15 - 28:25)
said so gather but nobody nobody would (28:21 - 28:27)
have believed that you have gotten it (28:25 - 28:29)
right on the first try so very fair uh (28:27 - 28:37)
the other name is lun a a la luna la la (28:29 - 28:45)
loo loo loo loo lala lalala lalala Allah (28:37 - 28:49)
Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah mom Allah (28:45 - 28:51)
Allah (28:49 - 28:56)
okay so so gay Leo and Louie la la Luna (28:51 - 29:06)
his name's Rebecca I cannot so what I (28:56 - 29:06)
have no doubt that these are obviously (29:06 - 29:14)
official gamefreak trademarks I I find (29:09 - 29:16)
it hard I find it hard to believe that (29:14 - 29:20)
these are like final names because (29:16 - 29:24)
usually Pokemon names are not that hard (29:20 - 29:27)
to pronounce and I'm terrible at English (29:24 - 29:30)
don't get me wrong but when we get to (29:27 - 29:33)
the other names I feel like they're just (29:30 - 29:35)
all very hard to pronounce the third (29:33 - 29:38)
name which was trademarked was Marsh (29:35 - 29:44)
shadow and AR shadow the word shadow so (29:38 - 29:46)
that's a little bit simpler I think are (29:44 - 29:51)
you sure it's not Mars I Dow I Mars head (29:46 - 29:55)
o could be one the marsh my ad down yeah (29:51 - 29:57)
it could be Margit think about spacings (29:55 - 30:00)
here this is it it's a super evolution (29:57 - 30:03)
of Marshtomp hey I mean our shadow come (30:00 - 30:06)
on NASA edition so the word i see that (30:03 - 30:08)
stands out is the words shadow and (30:06 - 30:11)
there's an MA are in front of it so if (30:08 - 30:13)
I'm looking at my name you didn't see (30:11 - 30:16)
the gear in migire nuh so right woo (30:13 - 30:20)
you're right debatable so gay leo is (30:16 - 30:25)
obviously your son pokemon with your sol (30:20 - 30:30)
as sole son right loon alia is your moon (30:25 - 30:33)
Pokemon lunar is what I'm getting from (30:30 - 30:37)
that and then mar shadow is your third (30:33 - 30:40)
that's it that's your curium shadow uh (30:37 - 30:44)
it's the in-between of Sun and Moon I (30:40 - 30:46)
guess I get I mean that makes sense in (30:44 - 30:50)
in in some logic that makes sense is (30:46 - 30:54)
Mars between the Sun and the moon no but (30:50 - 30:56)
a shadow would be like the sun is out (30:54 - 31:00)
but it forms this darkness which would (30:56 - 31:02)
be more moon and that's where you get (31:00 - 31:04)
shadowed by Mars yeah (31:02 - 31:07)
eclipse I don't understand the shadow (31:04 - 31:10)
it's um it's a Mart Marsh Marshall no (31:07 - 31:12)
that's not it I was recently at the (31:10 - 31:14)
National Air and Space Museum and they (31:12 - 31:17)
were no pokemon there so all this is (31:14 - 31:22)
fake all of this last busted bus myth (31:17 - 31:26)
busted I do like this soul so Lola I'm (31:22 - 31:29)
gonna say sole goal a 0 because it looks (31:26 - 31:33)
like they're they're putting some (31:29 - 31:36)
influence from the name Galileo into (31:33 - 31:42)
that mmm I really had I like that to me (31:36 - 31:44)
also the games can take place in Spain (31:42 - 31:51)
so where does luna la come from mmm (31:44 - 31:56)
little pony no all right fair enough (31:51 - 32:00)
yeah yeah it's it all right the the (31:56 - 32:02)
upcoming starter names again I think (32:00 - 32:06)
these names are hard to say and I'm (32:02 - 32:07)
probably saying them wrong but this (32:06 - 32:11)
these are the three names i have NY a BB (32:07 - 32:22)
y niabi nibby 999 noby noby noby noby (32:11 - 32:24)

speculating Nabi would be the water (33:35 - 33:40)
pokemon ash am already would be the fire (33:38 - 33:44)
pokemon and Mo carro would be the grass (33:40 - 33:46)
pokemon and then if you want to get into (33:44 - 33:50)
more speculation nay Abby would be I (33:46 - 33:54)
think they said water fairy a shamari (33:50 - 34:00)

grass dark or something like that grass (34:00 - 34:07)

seal and then they I was hurt I was (34:46 - 34:54)
hearing like a bowel or some sort of (34:50 - 34:57)
like bird ish pokemon for the grasp (34:54 - 35:01)
what's a good triangle with fairy fairy (34:57 - 35:06)
I mean like I I don't know the triangle (35:01 - 35:08)
area type Sun type and moon type yeah (35:06 - 35:10)
very fighting won't I are you fighting (35:08 - 35:13)
steel series strata on fighting fighting (35:10 - 35:15)
strong on steel steel strong on ferry (35:13 - 35:19)
the ego yeah i just i don't believe that (35:15 - 35:25)
the final trio would be very psychic (35:19 - 35:27)
dragon or whatever the three combination (35:25 - 35:30)
is I mean for every single pokemon game (35:27 - 35:30)
people (35:30 - 35:32)
like well it's going to be dark fighting (35:30 - 35:36)
psychic or it's going to be steel fire (35:32 - 35:40)
water like they attach like this must be (35:36 - 35:44)
the the pattern and we've seen with the (35:40 - 35:46)
three starter Pokemon that there really (35:44 - 35:49)
isn't a pattern like I think empoleon is (35:46 - 35:51)
the only water steel and the other two (35:49 - 35:53)
didn't matter and we've had how many (35:51 - 35:56)
fire Fighting's now throughout the the (35:53 - 35:59)
six games up to this point like yep why (35:56 - 36:01)
does a triangle have to be assigned to (35:59 - 36:04)
these starters like I I think people (36:01 - 36:06)
like over think that or or that (36:04 - 36:08)
something that people can understand (36:06 - 36:11)
that doesn't and I think maybe they want (36:08 - 36:18)
some is some level of long-haul usage (36:11 - 36:20)
for you know competitive play and stuff (36:18 - 36:25)
but I yeah I mean I I agree I don't what (36:20 - 36:29)
why why though why yeah I mean if it has (36:25 - 36:33)
it cool awesome but I don't think it's (36:29 - 36:37)
it's it's necessary uh yeah so I don't (36:33 - 36:42)
know if those are final names to me they (36:37 - 36:44)
seem a little more abstract than what (36:42 - 36:47)
pokemon has done in the past but well (36:44 - 36:48)
the what sticks out to me is the (36:47 - 36:51)
starters at least feel like they're (36:48 - 36:57)
probably the Japanese starter names I (36:51 - 36:59)
mean clearly if they're being (36:57 - 37:02)
trademarked in Japan but I think I think (36:59 - 37:03)
those are really hard to pronounce in (37:02 - 37:05)
English and they'd probably avoid that (37:03 - 37:07)
it's just it would be interesting to see (37:05 - 37:12)
more like japanese traditional given I (37:07 - 37:15)
you know pronunciations come to like (37:12 - 37:18)
universal names yeah just be universal (37:15 - 37:20)
names but lizard my doubt that's the (37:18 - 37:23)
case I feel like the pokemon company (37:20 - 37:25)
North America will not be able to help (37:23 - 37:30)
themselves with putting a very American (37:25 - 37:32)
and spin on whatever it is they're a (37:30 - 37:34)
very English spin on whatever it is the (37:32 - 37:36)
names are gonna be I'm trying to think (37:34 - 37:38)
of like hard poke money well every (37:36 - 37:39)
Pokemon name is pretty hard for me to (37:38 - 37:44)
say eva toe exert eous i would say those (37:39 - 37:44)
are a little bit (37:44 - 37:51)
harder um bacon bird Oshawott was pretty (37:44 - 37:55)
easy chespin hey Pig yeah I think (37:51 - 37:58)
usually the starters are way easier to (37:55 - 37:59)
pronounce and I think probably because (37:58 - 38:03)
they anticipate you know a lot of a lot (37:59 - 38:06)
of kids are gonna be saying them mm-hmm (38:03 - 38:09)
so they wanna greninja they're looking (38:06 - 38:12)
at all that hot new merch blaze it can (38:09 - 38:15)
get you you gotta go more obscure like (38:12 - 38:19)
credit I and like a lot a lot a llama (38:15 - 38:22)
yeah aloma la la la that one's really (38:19 - 38:29)
hard to say ah beautiful ditto that may (38:22 - 38:33)
not work Oh harsh to say doesn't know (38:29 - 38:36)
I'm just kidding to those times Ekans (38:33 - 38:41)
those Jen oners man far-fetched the (38:36 - 38:47)
far-fetched ah that's a yeah that's all (38:41 - 38:50)
I got I'd cook oh oh regus (38:47 - 38:55)
