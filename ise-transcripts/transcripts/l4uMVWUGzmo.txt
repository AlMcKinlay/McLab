parking lot no you gotta get already you taper piece of paper man why do they make me socialize that's my question I know because you know that when you walk into gamestop you're going to have to interrupt a very important conversation between the gamestop employee and the call of duty fan of which call of duty is better you have to interrupt that conversation it's true and say so that I can then 8 then they're going to do a heavy sigh I did not send out the overwatch beta codes please contact this email address if you need the overwatch open beta code you you should really upset about people watching baby playing blood-borne it's a better game then you're gonna have to ask for the dark rye code they're either gonna give you two answers they're gonna say we're out of codes man you should have came earlier or they're gonna say I'll do you know a Pokemon Sun and Moon are being announced you know they're coming out this hot you better pre or cuz you know pokemon games they all want to preorder I want a pre-order man also did you know that if you get a powerup rewards card I don't know if that's what they call it anymore that is what it's not it you get sick deals on everything you know except welcome to gamestop of you have he has gotten all the pokemon up to this point i think it was mu Celebi uh his last monster jirachi you ranchi uh i think i did actually i was under i assumed that i wasn't gonna get some of them just from not paying attention but i think i'm caught up currently which is a surprise to me I've got them all except the darkest of rice Darkrai I got I got the dark right code I'm on the first day I went to the gamestop on my lunch break ask for the code you only gave me one and I really kind of wanted to pressure to ask more but then I I was like gnats it's nothing makes it worth having a conversation with this game stuff employee that particular gamestop employee or any games mostly pretty much any supple mmm alright so I got some new york specific news breaking lately close to New York breaking news a man was charged with attempting to steal 15 packs of pokemon cards let you guys take that in for a minute did he weigh them first preferred the there was nothing in the article states if there was a scale being wait i have here they didn't know i need to know how they how they were being stolen like it were they in his shirt did he have a backpack I took it's a pretty short socks worth reporting detail a man was booked and charged with stealing 15 packs of pokemon cards from a local Walmart over the weekend officials say that 20 year old 21 year old Christopher Christopher Smith ran off with the cards valued just at 63 dollars and attempted to snatch stash them underneath a car in a parking lot new york state troopers stopped Smith and cuffed him after receiving a call from the walmart he faces charges of petit larceny Smith will then return to court on May ninth all right find out what courthouses will have a live court reporter there sir what were you hoping to achieve by stealing 15 packs of hopefully they were fates collide uh sir what is the deck you are currently running and what cards did you plan on pulling from these 15 packs dat pizza father an Umbreon Yanks Oh what local regional competition were you aiming for what cards are good now well I'm brioni X I know is what one of our slack dudes is trying to get um but I mean I know Vanguard carts ah 63 well you know when when you start the article saying that a man stole 15 poke 15 packs of pokemon cards you go all right like you know he had a set goal he had something in mind but then when you put the vet value of its only $63 where the cards you really second-guess his motive see my kid that's my that's why my question is how did it what was how was he trying to get away with them was it just as many as he could carry or did he go I feel like 15 is a good number that's what I'm gonna try and get away with my is that just how many you could put in his socks before he got out of there why didn't he steal yugioh cards or you know I gathering I feel like 15 is a good luck one handful there was a man for video participation Lee well dig hands man I feel like I mean well what do they come in those like cardboards oh yeah that was it hard walmart yeah so maybe 15 is two handfuls and then you're running this is again great audio quality lynching sprinting out of there this is hamburger sighs now do you think not not you not like hamburger we're not mcdonalds and you're there but i'm talking like a real burger tap & tap and shake delicious that's a good point maybe it's maybe it's maybe they're online codes maybe he was stealing online codes for do they sell those in the store online codes yeah maybe stealing digital pet pegs okay i so he's getting out of there with real physical cards do you think when he ran into the parking lot and clearly he knew the police was being called hence why he stashed the pokemon cards underneath the car do you think he like was like yeah they probably wouldn't check on that man every part story like really like you ran by a car and pitched him under it looks like i need to keep going the raf you're not gonna catch me with these packs the rav4 has too much clearance so i gotta throw it underneath a Honda Civic because the ride real low yo yo you really I mean that was that's pretty much the best news you guys are getting right now welcome back to uh put pokemon TCG dateline ah it's golden week in Japan what would we supposed to do cats I don't even know what that means but that's the excuse that's been given to me apparently they get the entire week off who is the everything Japan the entire country I mean like I'm coming yes the same we shout he says everybody's like her out of here doesn't like Dragon Quest have to come out first for that to happen dragging a bust just people play that what about Monster Hunter yeah you know that monsters I mean monsters better but we're not here to debate the hunting of monsters oh I thought this was gamestop well no could we haven't talked about overwatch yet uh the Pokemon jukebox app this is an Android exclusive this came out the same time most of the albums were hitting iTunes actually I don't know if the the soundtracks are on like Amazon or anything but for android users you got it an app called Pokemon jukebox that will not be discontinued and that will happen over the next two months from May 31st and onward the app will no longer be available to download via Google Play this includes redownloading the app so if it's not on your phone after May 31st you won't be able to redownload it a new music will no longer be available for purchase from june thirtieth onward all services of the app will be concluded in the tech industry they use the usually use the word sunsetted because apparently that just use the word closed its shut down it's done don't hurt it it's done so mad music no longer be downloaded to the app however it is still possible to listen to any music that was already been purchased and downloaded again if you purchase music and you no longer have the app you'll no longer be able to get the app to listen to the music you bought welcome to bad purchasing 101 pokemon jukebox if you didn't know what it did I it offered three songs uh it offered I think it was three songs for three days and then they would rotate out for different three songs that you can listen to free otherwise you could only listen to previews and then bye and I believe they were like a 99 cents to a dollar twenty-nine a song I don't know if anyone actually went through with that but goodbye Pokemon jukebox The Sun has set its sunsetted say it yet I mean if you're an Android user that's not even a word come on sunsetted that's not the signing of set that's not a word uh Pokemon go that's also a mobile app Sun setting sun is exciting already Moscow has resting on Pokemon go they're closing it down we're gonna be we're gonna be sun setting me tomo later this year uh no please no please no me tomo least pokemon go footage showed off some pokemon evolution so I the video has since been pulled so I didn't actually watch the YouTube video how evolution has worked when we read a little bit from the article here in the new leaked footage which lasted about a minute the tester uses evolution that mean evolution shards to evolve an abra into Cadabra players collect evolution chards shards by catching pokemon of the same type meaning the trainer will need to do a bit of grinding in order to who would have thought a mobile game with grinding a Pokemon game with grinding who would have thought nude a bit of grinding in order to evolve their favorite pokemon of course this is a big deviation from normal pokemon games which use leveling up evolution storms and a few other techniques for evolving Pokemon I wishing stones yes okay you said storms the evolution storms when thunderous makes your jolteon evolved into a metric that that doesn't happen another Pokemon goes go news beta testers also notice some new variations to the x biomes biomes biodomes that determined what pokemon appear where some testers have speculated about the existence of rare rare spots which spawn rare and unusual pokémon similar to Pokemon goes gyms and pokey stops these these rare spots seem to be tied down to known landmarks and destinations other testers also recently noticed that the weather seemed to impact the spawn rate of pokemon during a recent rainstorm testers notice that water pokemon began to spawn in areas where urban pokemon like ratata and Magnemite usually appear well the slip Silk Road subreddit where if you are really if you're so excited for Pokemon go that you need consistent Pokemon good news i would suggest checking out that subreddit they have confirmed that that they confirmed exactly what i just said actually so i'm not going to repeat that pokemon go I still does not have a release date people are anticipating it coming this summer we've talked about Pokemon go a little bit here I don't know if we got in your opinions on Pokemon go Micah um I think I I can't remember I feel like i did my opinion has always been that I'm optimistically skeptical I guess is the best way to put it that's funny because I'm step skeptically optimistic I I am interested in it and I am it i will definitely be downloading it and playing it and everything but i don't i don't think that it's gonna necessarily be as amazing as everybody is hoping it's gonna be that's my opinion on it i think i think that there I've said before that there have been pokemon clones that have done this already to some extent obviously not with VR and it's not an official pokemon game so that makes a huge difference but they've existed and it hasn't been super interesting it's been really interesting for the first like you're four days and then that's pretty much it but if they can make it interesting enough that it retains that excitement over the course of you know months for me that that will be a big deal yeah I'm hoping that it being an official game gives lens some of that you know that excitement to it but yeah I think some people are going to be disappointed because they're over hyping there in their imagination what it's going to be and then some people will say well yeah it's not like the super supreme of what I wanted but it's still fun to play so I'm gonna just hang out and play it yeah but also come on Joey to where I don't see myself taking road trips to catch specific pokemon or anything like that you know like I don't I just I don't see that being maybe it it may be will be yeah it'll be a big thing but no you told me you only take one vacation a year so she'll just sit on polka was like oh I never what what about that bacon Birdman what if there's a bacon bird in the middle of my road and I gotta travel for it i mean i was i was on day one very impressed with me tomo and then i figured out how pretty shallow it is and the fact that in attendance just data mining you based off of like what's your favorite bread I don't know sourdough that's my no no no me tomo tailing there but it it runs very thin for me and obviously i've been on a clash royale kick and I could easily talk about clash Royale for an hour and that game is rotten with like timers and micro transactions but at the end of the day the reason I keep going back to clash Royale is because the actual game itself is really good yeah I like the PvP aspect of class rail and like I don't know like going to me tomo and fine being out that there's new boots or there's a cat suit I can purchase for a thousand gold is like not enough to go back and like keep going to it yes I see your me tomo you okay Steve you're going I'm a Mariela talk what one attack about it I did ends her fresh French baguettes for talk about it I look challah french baguette like some sourdough tomato basil great breath by Cinco de Mayo joke shows a disaster all right Pete Michael what's your favorite my favorite bread oh I really like a good rye I have not a big fan all right well I feel like you have a weird favorite bread oh we ho ho it's what about honey wheat I like here's the thing though are we talking about bread this used in Sandwich format or just you're eating a piece of bread I can eat pretty much it's just a piece of bread other Pokemon are Shaymin no he's not a legendary he's a mythical mystical okay so the first two names that were trademarked were I'm gonna slaughter these names the sole Gail galiyo so Gallio ooh I like the way I said that Salah Holly oh so agua Sluggo s a legume gee al yo Gally oh that's what I just said so gather but nobody nobody would have believed that you have gotten it right on the first try so very fair uh the other name is lun a a la luna la la loo loo loo loo lala lalala lalala Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah mom Allah Allah okay so so gay Leo and Louie la la Luna his name's Rebecca I cannot so what I have no doubt that these are obviously official gamefreak trademarks I I find it hard I find it hard to believe that these are like final names because usually Pokemon names are not that hard to pronounce and I'm terrible at English don't get me wrong but when we get to the other names I feel like they're just all very hard to pronounce the third name which was trademarked was Marsh shadow and AR shadow the word shadow so that's a little bit simpler I think are you sure it's not Mars I Dow I Mars head o could be one the marsh my ad down yeah it could be Margit think about spacings here this is it it's a super evolution of Marshtomp hey I mean our shadow come on NASA edition so the word i see that stands out is the words shadow and there's an MA are in front of it so if I'm looking at my name you didn't see the gear in migire nuh so right woo you're right debatable so gay leo is obviously your son pokemon with your sol as sole son right loon alia is your moon Pokemon lunar is what I'm getting from that and then mar shadow is your third that's it that's your curium shadow uh it's the in-between of Sun and Moon I guess I get I mean that makes sense in in in some logic that makes sense is Mars between the Sun and the moon no but a shadow would be like the sun is out but it forms this darkness which would be more moon and that's where you get shadowed by Mars yeah eclipse I don't understand the shadow it's um it's a Mart Marsh Marshall no that's not it I was recently at the National Air and Space Museum and they were no pokemon there so all this is fake all of this last busted bus myth busted I do like this soul so Lola I'm gonna say sole goal a 0 because it looks like they're they're putting some influence from the name Galileo into that mmm I really had I like that to me also the games can take place in Spain so where does luna la come from mmm little pony no all right fair enough yeah yeah it's it all right the the upcoming starter names again I think these names are hard to say and I'm probably saying them wrong but this these are the three names i have NY a BB y niabi nibby 999 noby noby noby noby sounds like it's probably what it would be s nabi nabi pokemon Downton Abbey nabi mmm yep that's it that's correct second name is a sh I ma RI ash emari ashemar I shimmer I Asian run a shimmering ash greninja mmm the Luna to my National Army and the name is mo carro em okay you are Oh aah no aah and oh how many letters with that mo k you are Oh like the end of Pharaoh is what I'm getting from that so mo whoo and then the end of row so nay Abby would be if I remember what people were speculating Nabi would be the water pokemon ash am already would be the fire pokemon and Mo carro would be the grass pokemon and then if you want to get into more speculation nay Abby would be I think they said water fairy a shamari would be fire dragon and makara would be grass dark or something like that grass ghost I can't remember this is no it would say something in the Triangle uh this this article says moku row has moku in it which means tree or wood in Japanese making progress starter pokémon ash and mari is believed to be related to ashke which means sea lion okay I mixed up navya well mari is short for marine there you go yeah so one of the niabi is believed to be a cat rhymes with tabby all Sonia and Japanese Japanese from meow that's also true I just thought it firecat fire thought yeah yeah be sounded like a Naiad so that would be water water water water seal and then they I was hurt I was hearing like a bowel or some sort of like bird ish pokemon for the grasp what's a good triangle with fairy fairy I mean like I I don't know the triangle area type Sun type and moon type yeah very fighting won't I are you fighting steel series strata on fighting fighting strong on steel steel strong on ferry the ego yeah i just i don't believe that the final trio would be very psychic dragon or whatever the three combination is I mean for every single pokemon game people like well it's going to be dark fighting psychic or it's going to be steel fire water like they attach like this must be the the pattern and we've seen with the three starter Pokemon that there really isn't a pattern like I think empoleon is the only water steel and the other two didn't matter and we've had how many fire Fighting's now throughout the the six games up to this point like yep why does a triangle have to be assigned to these starters like I I think people like over think that or or that something that people can understand that doesn't and I think maybe they want some is some level of long-haul usage for you know competitive play and stuff but I yeah I mean I I agree I don't what why why though why yeah I mean if it has it cool awesome but I don't think it's it's it's necessary uh yeah so I don't know if those are final names to me they seem a little more abstract than what pokemon has done in the past but well the what sticks out to me is the starters at least feel like they're probably the Japanese starter names I mean clearly if they're being trademarked in Japan but I think I think those are really hard to pronounce in English and they'd probably avoid that it's just it would be interesting to see more like japanese traditional given I you know pronunciations come to like universal names yeah just be universal names but lizard my doubt that's the case I feel like the pokemon company North America will not be able to help themselves with putting a very American and spin on whatever it is they're a very English spin on whatever it is the names are gonna be I'm trying to think of like hard poke money well every Pokemon name is pretty hard for me to say eva toe exert eous i would say those are a little bit harder um bacon bird Oshawott was pretty easy chespin hey Pig yeah I think usually the starters are way easier to pronounce and I think probably because they anticipate you know a lot of a lot of kids are gonna be saying them mm-hmm so they wanna greninja they're looking at all that hot new merch blaze it can get you you gotta go more obscure like credit I and like a lot a lot a llama yeah aloma la la la that one's really hard to say ah beautiful ditto that may not work Oh harsh to say doesn't know I'm just kidding to those times Ekans those Jen oners man far-fetched the far-fetched ah that's a yeah that's all I got I'd cook oh oh regus Kofi Kofi graegus is hard did you even say it right I don't know yes yeah did I I know it's it's actually cough agree guys cuz it's like a cough cough like cooked cough cough Rodriguez trying to think landorus thunderous terrakion cobalion can you name all the pokemons I mean I'm sure I could like if you put pokemon in front of me I'll get its name whether I butcher or not I'll know what it is it didn't end them all in order that yep that's not happening ah yeah that's pretty much what we got for you guys just those news articles I don't think there was any other outstanding news to really report on if I did I apologize for missing it but get you anything yeah get your thigh guard before may 8th get your darkrai at gamestop as soon as possible the only reason i say that is because gamestop is known to run out of codes because it's on a it's on a piece of cardboard so get that otherwise I don't have any more pokemon news that's it this sholay something women without next week what comes out so hopefully something good comes out next week oh yeah Golden Week men all of Japan has shut down the they'll want they'll just got out of there they're fishing for all the sushis that we can have delicious sushi
