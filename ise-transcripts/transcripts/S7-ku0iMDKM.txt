question which pokemon is known as the magical pokemon hand right up there nope right here nope way in the back nope right here that was yours girl in the back yep nope this one might be tricky put one hat back there yep let me check my answers yes that is correct miss Maggie is nice job that's a hard one all right who is this Pokemon according to its pokedex entry it gains the ability to see the aura of its opponents by honing its mind through starvation right he for you to know way in the back yep no right here no I knew this guy there's a trick trip you guys up right here no uh blue

right we got one more question in the national pokedex which pokemon is 666 your hand went up right away the devil no double hands that is correct vivillon it is the butterfly pokémon from generation six there you go all right let let's get to the questions so I'm going to read what you what the person voted for and then I'm going to read the question and again Irene over here is tailing up the vote so we'll find out at the end here we got a vote for size or scissor sizer if there's anything that I can that I do correctly it's get Pokemon names wrong so the question is what is the best mega um hmm that is a good question I included I included medicham in here because I think medicham is one of those forgotten Pokemon uh and I that it would throw you guys all off with Lucario because of the aura and the pokedex entry but I think mega medicham is really really great I think it's design is one of the better ones and I think it's often overlooked so if you haven't checked out mega medicham that is one of my favorites we had another vote for size or why do some pokémon evolve and others don't hmm god you guys have put me on the spot I think that's what makes Pokemon unique I think that if if every single Pokemon had like a three step evolution like a Charmander char Malina Charizard you would kind of forget about that middle evolution a lot of people already forget about the metal evolution no one ever says that Wartortle is their favorite even though Wartortle is such a great Pokemon um but then you have Pokemon that stand out on its own like ditto or farfetch'd farfetch'd is an incredible Pokemon and so I know I don't think every Pokemon needs to evolve I also like the at first I hated it and I think maybe a lot of us hate it at the time when we first saw bouffalant and we're like oh there it is that's Taurus is evolution yeah and they're they're not related at all and then you also see miltank kind of fit in there and I think that's cool that you have three Pokemon that are really really similar but they don't evolve into each other I think that keeps them special in a way of like nature you have multiple different types of snakes they don't turn into each other we have a vote for charge a bug Magic School Bus Pokemon why did you make this pick bug Pokemon so I started doing this earlier at PAX East we did favor we did best water type Pokemon and if I'm not mistaken I believe squirtle one that a lot of votes for Magikarp though so why I did bug Pokemon is just because it's spring now so a lot of bugs are coming out and I sometimes bugs are forgotten I think Gen 4 only has four or five bug type Pokemon like they are there they're miss sometimes who would you pick as a starter all generations between all generations hmm we got somebody saying Mudkip uh I would probably say Litton right now who listen debate alright look for generation 7 let's let's see which pokemon wins here who would pick Litton let's get some Cheers but what about Rowlett our IP Litton what about my boy Papa Leo and father that was great I like letting a lot I'm a big I'm a big wrestling fan so the fact that Linton actually evolved into a wrestler uh I think that I think that's great hawlucha is also fantastic we got a vote for shuckle what is your favorite bug pokemon hmm I really like genesect I know that's kind of a a cop-out answer to pick a legendary but I think genesect is a really great bug Pokemon favorite cosplay you've seen at c2e2 oh sorry we got a vote for size or favorite cosplay I saw like four people cosplay as the squirtle squad which was pretty cool and I am a sucker for Team skull cosplay and we see a couple I see a couple in the audience teams called cosplay is really really great so that would obviously my picks are pokemon related got another vote for size or oh my gosh uh what is your favorite place to eat hmm I'm a fat that I like it cheap guys I'm a fan of Steak and Shake we don't we don't have those in Wisconsin where I'm from so it's like a luxury to go to Steak and Shake and get a meal under $4 let's look the greatest thing in the world to me these I can't read we got a vote for wimp odd that's an awesome Pokemon generation 7 what generation is your least favorite oh here we go and watch all this hate I don't like generation 3 I've talked about this before on my podcast uh generation 3 for me is a is a point in time where I fell out of Pokemon I grew up I was I was nine ten years old when red and blue came out and so of course when gold and silver came out that was even that was like the end of the world of oh my god a new Pokemon game on top of something I already love and then by the time that all rolled around I was getting into middle school and it was not cool to play Pokemon in middle school it was very much like oh I'm gonna take my lunch at this other table we're not going to talk anymore so I kept my Pokemon I kept my Pokemon in the closet then I just kind of fell out altogether and then when I was in high school that's where oh yeah Pokemon is cool again guys everyone's playing red and blue everyone's loving this Hey You Pikachu and so I took a risk and I was like I'm just gonna jump back into diamond pearl I'm in high school I'm cool I don't I don't need people telling me pokemons not cool and so generation four really sparked my love of Pokemon and that followed with heartgold SoulSilver which i think is just a fantastic game in the series and yeah ever since then I've been I've been all-in uh uh heartgold SoulSilver is when I started the podcast so I haven't stopped since we have a vote for [ __ ] ninja why do you think the online Pokemon challenges fail hmm I don't know what that's referring to okay no no clarification oh thank you yeah that the the kept challenges oh so in X&Y there's a bunch of challenges that you can do the first one was was it catching or yeah it was catching and then there was the egg hatching and then there was uh the trading and everything I don't think so they passed now like the last couple have succeeded but the ones before that I think Pokemon did a poor job in telling people how that worked there was a QR code one two I think that might have been the second one and I started doing the QR stuff and I didn't know you were supposed to talk to the person in the plaza before you signed up and so I did like twenty QR things I was like oh I guess none of these counted okay great I think it's a cool thing to get the community to you know go along with that and and do these group events I don't think the I don't think won the rewards are that great especially the the like the stretch goals they have it's like okay if you catch a twenty thousand Pokemon as a group you'll get two thousand play coins or whatever they're called but if you catch 40 thousand will give you one love ball that's like what one love ball guys come on I love a lot of Pokemon I need a lot of love balls that I think they should continue it I don't think that it's something they should get rid of but I think that that needs to be communicated better by the Pokemon company and I also think the rewards need to be better in that regard as well no vote for a Pokemon but the question is what is your favorite fairy type hmm I'm going to turn it back into a bug Pokemon and say I really like row bomb B which is bug fairy and sylveon is really cool you can't you can't you can't argue with an original the number want the very first fairy-type pokémon shown we got a vote for Scyther oh that's a great question which pokemon has been under promoted utilized / loved by the Pokemon company so obviously you have your Pikachu's in your Charizard which are kind of the four face of what Pokemon promotes then you have your Lucario which is also one of the Pokemon that gets pushed a lot and they kind of did that same thing with zoroark in generation five and I don't think Zora took off as well as as Lucario did but if you if you looked at how they did it they did they gave it the same kind of push there are just out of you know out of 700 Pokemon there are so many Pokemon not not pushed forward that should be I'm trying to think of a good one that they push Legendary's really hard it's weird though because they like push suicune and they push tend tie but they didn't push raikou like reich who got a movie afterwards but it wasn't it wasn't as like big as suicune in Pokemon forever or Raikou in Pokemon three the movie Pokemon should push a Pokemon they should push some far fetch because I can't get enough we gotta vote for Wurmple really some of you voted for whirlpool alright Star Wars or Star Trek I'm gonna get hate for this I'm gonna say Star Trek but can we get some cheers for Star Trek alright I'm worried what about Star Wars [Applause] we got a vote for a hair cross and the question is hotdog verse polish I'm an OG hotdog guy from the Gecko just ketchup and mustard I pretty sure Chicago hates ketchup haven't figured out why yet but I'm boring when it comes to that we got a vote for Beedrill mega forum is dope can't disagree with that does hare cross have a mega evolution yes it does the only question I'll get right today spinarak question is why are there so many beetles species why not spiders oh we got give at Galvin Chawla and Joel tick and ya ariados I can't say its name yeah I don't know I feel like we got most of the bugs we have a centipede yeah we got scolipede I don't like bugs so now no spiders needed we got a vote for a godless APOD I can't say that name no question speak of the devil we got to vote for scolipede what pokemon without an evolution light let me start that over what pokemon without an evolutionary line do you think deserves one man there's a lot so of course far fetch definitely so listen here what if far fetch evolved and it's leaked turned into like a samurai sword now we're talking it's already like halfway there to fit like the samurai theme especially the anime definitely teases that too episode like 21 or something when Farfetch'd debuted but far fetched deserves a mega evolution i would be opposed to seeing the the pikachu spin-offs like Emolga and denna day and Plusle minun i feel like they it's they could get evolutions at this point i mean you have you have Raichu and right you got a lot of a lot of push behind a lowland right - which I'm a big big fan of that we got a vote for Beedrill slash luck chuckle I don't know if you can vote twice uh-huh but the the question is why is Jen for the best Jen Jen Jen Thor is good that was that was like I said earlier that was the game that brought me into Pokemon I think Gen 4 is great for what it accomplished but I don't think I would love a remake first off I definitely think we should see a diamond in Pearl I think that generation 5 6 & 7 took some risks and whether or not they paid off that's debatable I don't think Gen 4 took any risk though I think it was a very safe game and that's okay that's what I needed at the time but if they were to remake Gen 4 or bring back Gen 4 do whatever they do I definitely think that there would have to be some huge gimmick that is different than everything we see and the remake of generation 3 kind of did that and they did have they did add a delta episode at the end they added the flying on Latios and latias and stuff but generation 3 also felt like two steps back whereas in generation 6 we got character customization we got changing mostly character customization I just love being able to like mean in a Pokemon game and then generation three came and they took all that away in order to tell the story that they told a decade ago and I don't know if that works I'm sure that some people love it I have a lot of fondness for Gen 4 and I've already played that game so give me Gen 4 but give me something new give me a reason to play that game again we gotta vote for Combee which I am a fan of why is life hard you got a vote for wheedle that's why I like this hard somebody's voting for weasel no wheels alright uh do you love the switch do you think Pokemon stars is a real thing great questions so I haven't intend to switch I love it I adore it I think it's everything that I wanted in in a console I don't commute through public transportation so when I Drive to work it's a 30-minute Drive in my car when I get home I'm usually playing like Wii U or ps4 or something that involves a TV so I actually don't use my 3s as much as I should but to have something like the switch and be able to play Zelda on my TV which is what I would prefer to play any game that just feels great but then to be able to take that to like c2e2 because I know that I'm going to be waiting for panels or I know there's downtime and be able to play it there or in my bed that is everything I want so if they were to bring a Pokemon game or anything like that that is the route I want to see especially I like Monster Hunter I think Monster Hunter would be perfect for the switch as for Pokemon stars Eurogamer reported on the switch and they got pretty much everything right prior to the switch being announced specs price release date your gamer was also the same publication that reported on stars so while I don't think it will be called stars I do believe that that is coming again I don't work for the put I don't work for the Pokemon company or anything but when you have a company like Eurogamer get pretty much everything right on switch and then also say hey there's making a Pokemon game okay yeah you could get it wrong but you got everything right so far so why so I guess I'd rather I want it to be true so that that seems tempting the other thing too is that people pulled the the game data from from Sun and Moon and the models and the character figures are really actually high-res and the 3ds doesn't support that obviously because the 3d S is six years old but I always I also found it weird that even on a new 3ds that Pokemon Sun and Moon didn't run that well anytime you got into an ultra beast encounter or anytime you got into a like a doubles battle the frame rate really chugged and it's weird to think that Game Freak the number two best-selling franchise in the world Pokemon only followed by Mario would make a Pokemon game that didn't run as well as it could on the new 3ds without having another plan and so if it is true that Eurogamer reported on it and it is true that all these Pokemon models all these character figures all these towns are actually way more high-res than the 3ds can prove like why would you do that extra work if you don't if if you didn't have plans for a third version or a version on a different console so this is my opinion I wouldn't be surprised though if we if we saw a Pokemon stars or a Pokemon Eclipse or whatever they're calling it I would love to see that we haven't vote for genesect why is Rowlett the weakest a lowland starter no I don't think while it's that weak just how you use it he involves into a dead ghost owl that's pretty cool I again on the road for genesect catch up on pizza yes or no no there's like a cover there's Co people saying yes no yeah no I like how the non Pokemon questions are the ones that cause debate between you guys favorite bugra bombi question please come up with an assaulting name Allah but face for Wurmple for your favorite Pokemon Thanks okay hmm yeah we're poll has like a little blood face which is it was just it's funny ah hmm man you're putting me on the spot all right so I brought up Farfetch'd a couple times so insulting name cooked duck we gotta vote for Gallo subhodh little Vlad why do you hate Pokemon snap I don't hate Pokemon snap I love Pokemon snap my girlfriend Irene who has tallied up all the votes thank you very much she played Pokemon snap for the first time and not no joke for the first probably thirty minutes of the game she was like ah I don't get why people think this is fun I'm not having fun this isn't fun and then she got to the volcano where you get the Charmander and you throw the Apple and they're all like ma ma ma there's like 30 of them incredible game of the year 2017 game of the year pokemon snap we have a vote from fortress where do you go when you go to sleep I go to my bed it's on the second floor I have to fight three cats for my spot again on the road for sighs Oh Pokemon on switch you better believe it honestly we'll probably get a spinoff first before we get anything like that got a vote for scolipede why is love dis the best Pokemon of all time Wyatt why is life hard oh this is a great question vote for a gala spot every time I said it just gets more and more butchered what pokemon would you want to be added to Super Smash Brothers why isn't Machamp in Super Smash Brothers he is four arms and a belt a championship belt he have a Pokemon tournaments not that great um hmm oh ha ha lucha I would say hawlucha hawlucha is really great we got a vote for Caterpie but I can't read the question so just Caterpie we got a vote for Butterfree that was the so that was another smash brothers question we got a vote for Butterfree again what is your favorite fire type Pokemon in sin Aurora get a vote for Scyther since pokeballs are smaller than pokemon then pokemon must shrink to fit I can't read the rest of the question but I think it's funny if we just leave it there I'm gonna vote for sizer why is there no heavy ball merch out there there's a lot of Pokemon stuff on the show for at c2e2 it's really great I didn't buy any but though cuz it's real fur priced I didn't see ya there was no heavy balls out there I saw like there was love balls and there was aa like the GS ball that I saw some being sold there was no luxury balls and there was no premier balls the two best pokeballs in the game none were being sold I got him up for Scyther we got vote for Beedrill and in all caps it says what is bug super effective I agree we gotta vote for Jenna sex can ash greninja evolve to mega ash greninja I don't think so ash greninja is a weird thing it's like man ash greninja mate just makes me want to talk about Digimon and how great the Digimon anime is compared to Pokemon met we got a vote for Metapod what is your favorite Pokemon I have a lot of favorite Pokemon I'll give you a couple Chandeleur ammonite hawlucha a mini cube he comes in and out not Charizard tore tears alright he is a bonsai tree going on oh yeah come on did you finish the tally okay oh gosh I know what the number one is we had a vote for a bomb B would it be more efficient rather 10 best Pokemon 2 9 favorite Pokemon that aren't vanilluxe that's good we did ice I feel like vanilluxe would be a shoo-in vanilluxe is really great alright I think we're out of I think we're out of questions here some of you guys have fantastic handwriting some not so much if Mewtwo there's no vote for a Pokemon here if Mewtwo can get a mega evolution why can't Darkrai Darkrai oh why was Pikachu put as the face of Pokemon okay two questions I don't I want to see more mega Pokemon so mega pokemons really great in the fact that it doesn't increase the Pokedex number so I would love to see more mega Pokemon it would be weird if they just stopped like hey here's 50 mega Pokemon guess what guys no more I could see them doing that though I also like a lull in Pokemon I like the fact again that who would have thought like a year ago people would be people would be saying executor was really cool like no one said that a year ago and then they were like hey here's executor but it's 7,000 feet tall and it's dragon and everyone lost their mind and I think that's incredible and the same for like Sandshrew and sandslash and Vulpix and nine tails of course there's going to be your yourse and true and your Vulpix lovers and they're there they're out there but not everyone was talking about those Pokemon they're not like a Lucario we're a Charizard or a Pikachu and so to be able to take a mega Pokemon or to take in a lowland form or whatever they do in the future and apply that to older Pokemon and bring them back into the spotlight I think that's I think that's fantastic and I would love to see them continuing to do that why I was Pikachu put at the face of the company why is life hard alright I don't know when we started this now remember Chicago this is your list this is not my list you voted for these pokemon so when you walk out of here upset and bitter that your bug pokemon didn't become number one you only have yourselves to blame I would have voted for fire fetch but he's not bug all right boy we're starting off great we have a four-way tie for 10th place so for 10 9 8 and 7 we have hare cross row bomb B Gallus pod and shedinja for six place yen mega like we said earlier but fantastic choice for fifth place Scyther for fourth-place genesect for third place Beedrill for second place Butterfree I'm so proud of you guys there's no Wurmple there's no Caterpie there's no wheedle and for your number one favorite bug type Pokemon size or [Applause] and yeah that's pretty much it I don't know how
