question in the national pokedex which (5:51 - 5:58)
pokemon is 666 your hand went up right (5:55 - 6:06)
away the devil no double hands that is (5:58 - 6:08)
correct (6:06 - 6:11)
vivillon it is the butterfly pokémon (6:08 - 6:16)
from generation six there you go all (6:11 - 6:23)
right let let's get to the questions so (6:16 - 6:24)
I'm going to read what you what the (6:23 - 6:26)
person voted for and then I'm going to (6:24 - 6:28)
read the question and again Irene over (6:26 - 6:30)
here is tailing up the vote so we'll (6:28 - 6:32)
find out at the end here (6:30 - 6:35)
we got a vote for size or scissor sizer (6:32 - 6:38)
if there's anything that I can that I do (6:35 - 6:41)
correctly it's get Pokemon names wrong (6:38 - 6:45)
so the question is what is the best mega (6:41 - 6:48)
um hmm that is a good question I (6:45 - 6:51)
included I included medicham in here (6:48 - 6:53)
because I think medicham is one of those (6:51 - 6:57)
forgotten Pokemon uh and I that it would (6:53 - 6:59)
throw you guys all off with Lucario (6:57 - 7:00)
because of the aura and the pokedex (6:59 - 7:03)
entry but I think mega medicham is (7:00 - 7:05)
really really great I think it's design (7:03 - 7:08)
is one of the better ones and I think (7:05 - 7:10)
it's often overlooked so if you haven't (7:08 - 7:12)
checked out mega medicham that is one of (7:10 - 7:15)
my favorites we had another vote for (7:12 - 7:18)
size or why do some pokémon evolve and (7:15 - 7:19)
others don't (7:18 - 7:22)
hmm god you guys have put me on the spot (7:19 - 7:26)
I think that's what makes Pokemon unique (7:22 - 7:29)
I think that if if every single Pokemon (7:26 - 7:31)
had like a three step evolution like a (7:29 - 7:33)
Charmander char Malina Charizard you (7:31 - 7:35)
would kind of forget about that middle (7:33 - 7:36)
evolution a lot of people already forget (7:35 - 7:38)
about the metal evolution no one ever (7:36 - 7:40)
says that Wartortle is their favorite (7:38 - 7:41)
even though Wartortle is such a great (7:40 - 7:44)
Pokemon um but then you have Pokemon (7:41 - 7:46)
that stand out on its own like ditto or (7:44 - 7:48)
farfetch'd farfetch'd is an incredible (7:46 - 7:50)
Pokemon and so I know I don't think (7:48 - 7:53)
every Pokemon needs to evolve I also (7:50 - 7:56)
like the at first I hated it and I think (7:53 - 7:58)
maybe a lot of us hate it at the time (7:56 - 7:59)
when we first saw bouffalant and we're (7:58 - 8:01)
like oh there it is that's Taurus is (7:59 - 8:04)
evolution yeah and they're they're not (8:01 - 8:06)
related at all and then you also see (8:04 - 8:08)
miltank kind of fit in there and I think (8:06 - 8:09)
that's cool that you have three Pokemon (8:08 - 8:13)
that are really really similar but they (8:09 - 8:14)
don't evolve into each other I think (8:13 - 8:16)
that keeps them special in a way of like (8:14 - 8:17)
nature you have multiple different types (8:16 - 8:19)
of snakes they don't turn into each (8:17 - 8:22)
other we have a vote for charge a bug (8:19 - 8:26)
Magic School Bus Pokemon why did you (8:22 - 8:28)
make this pick bug Pokemon so I started (8:26 - 8:31)
doing this earlier at PAX East we did (8:28 - 8:34)
favor we did best water type Pokemon and (8:31 - 8:36)
if I'm not mistaken I believe squirtle (8:34 - 8:38)
one that a lot of votes for Magikarp (8:36 - 8:42)
though so why I did bug Pokemon is just (8:38 - 8:43)
because it's spring now so a lot of bugs (8:42 - 8:46)
are coming out and I sometimes bugs are (8:43 - 8:48)
forgotten I think Gen 4 only has four or (8:46 - 8:50)
five bug type Pokemon like they are (8:48 - 8:54)
there they're miss sometimes who would (8:50 - 8:56)
you pick as a starter all generations (8:54 - 9:00)
between all generations hmm we got (8:56 - 9:02)
somebody saying Mudkip uh I would (9:00 - 9:06)
probably say Litton right now who listen (9:02 - 9:08)
debate alright look for generation 7 (9:06 - 9:10)
let's let's see which pokemon wins here (9:08 - 9:13)
who would pick Litton let's get some (9:10 - 9:15)
Cheers (9:13 - 9:15)
but what about Rowlett our IP Litton (9:17 - 9:31)
what about my boy Papa Leo and father (9:24 - 9:33)
that was great I like letting a lot I'm (9:31 - 9:35)
a big I'm a big wrestling fan so the (9:33 - 9:37)
fact that Linton actually evolved into a (9:35 - 9:39)
wrestler uh I think that I think that's (9:37 - 9:40)
great (9:39 - 9:43)
hawlucha is also fantastic we got a vote (9:40 - 9:46)
for shuckle what is your favorite bug (9:43 - 9:50)
pokemon hmm I really like genesect I (9:46 - 9:52)
know that's kind of a a cop-out answer (9:50 - 9:54)
to pick a legendary but I think genesect (9:52 - 9:57)
is a really great bug Pokemon favorite (9:54 - 10:00)
cosplay you've seen at c2e2 oh sorry we (9:57 - 10:03)
got a vote for size or favorite cosplay (10:00 - 10:05)
I saw like four people cosplay as the (10:03 - 10:07)
squirtle squad which was pretty cool and (10:05 - 10:11)
I am a sucker for Team skull cosplay and (10:07 - 10:12)
we see a couple I see a couple in the (10:11 - 10:14)
audience teams called cosplay is really (10:12 - 10:17)
really great so that would obviously my (10:14 - 10:20)
picks are pokemon related got another (10:17 - 10:22)
vote for size or oh my gosh (10:20 - 10:24)
uh what is your favorite place to eat (10:22 - 10:28)
hmm I'm a fat that I like it cheap guys (10:24 - 10:32)
I'm a fan of Steak and Shake we don't we (10:28 - 10:33)
don't have those in Wisconsin where I'm (10:32 - 10:37)
from so it's like a luxury to go to (10:33 - 10:39)
Steak and Shake and get a meal under $4 (10:37 - 10:40)
let's look the greatest thing in the (10:39 - 10:45)
world to me these I can't read we got a (10:40 - 10:47)
vote for wimp odd that's an awesome (10:45 - 10:50)
Pokemon generation 7 what generation is (10:47 - 10:53)
your least favorite oh here we go and (10:50 - 10:55)
watch all this hate I don't like (10:53 - 10:58)
generation 3 (10:55 - 10:58)
I've talked about this before on my (11:00 - 11:05)
podcast uh generation 3 for me is a is a (11:02 - 11:07)
point in time where I fell out of (11:05 - 11:11)
Pokemon I grew up I was I was nine ten (11:07 - 11:13)
years old when red and blue came out and (11:11 - 11:15)
so of course when gold and silver came (11:13 - 11:17)
out that was even that was like the end (11:15 - 11:19)
of the world of oh my god a new Pokemon (11:17 - 11:20)
game on top of something I already love (11:19 - 11:23)
and then by the time that all rolled (11:20 - 11:25)
around I was getting into middle school (11:23 - 11:28)
and it was not cool to play Pokemon in (11:25 - 11:31)
middle school it was very much like oh (11:28 - 11:33)
I'm gonna take my lunch at this other (11:31 - 11:37)
table we're not going to talk anymore so (11:33 - 11:40)
I kept my Pokemon I kept my Pokemon in (11:37 - 11:41)
the closet then I just kind of fell out (11:40 - 11:43)
altogether and then when I was in high (11:41 - 11:45)
school that's where oh yeah Pokemon is (11:43 - 11:48)
cool again guys everyone's playing red (11:45 - 11:50)
and blue everyone's loving this Hey You (11:48 - 11:53)
Pikachu and so I took a risk and I was (11:50 - 11:54)
like I'm just gonna jump back into (11:53 - 11:55)
diamond pearl I'm in high school I'm (11:54 - 11:57)
cool I don't I don't need people telling (11:55 - 11:59)
me pokemons not cool and so generation (11:57 - 12:01)
four really sparked my love of Pokemon (11:59 - 12:02)
and that followed with heartgold (12:01 - 12:04)
SoulSilver which i think is just a (12:02 - 12:08)
fantastic game in the series and yeah (12:04 - 12:09)
ever since then I've been I've been (12:08 - 12:10)
all-in (12:09 - 12:12)
uh uh heartgold SoulSilver is when I (12:10 - 12:15)
started the podcast so I haven't stopped (12:12 - 12:20)
since we have a vote for (12:15 - 12:23)
[ __ ] ninja why do you think the online (12:20 - 12:27)
Pokemon challenges fail hmm I don't know (12:23 - 12:29)
what that's referring to okay no no (12:27 - 12:33)
clarification oh thank you yeah that the (12:29 - 12:37)
the kept challenges oh so in X&Y there's (12:33 - 12:38)
a bunch of challenges that you can do (12:37 - 12:41)
the first one was was it catching or (12:38 - 12:42)
yeah it was catching and then there was (12:41 - 12:44)
the egg hatching and then there was uh (12:42 - 12:47)
the trading and everything I don't think (12:44 - 12:50)
so they passed now like the last couple (12:47 - 12:53)
have succeeded but the ones before that (12:50 - 12:55)
I think Pokemon did a poor job in (12:53 - 12:58)
telling people how that worked there was (12:55 - 13:00)
a QR code one two I think that might (12:58 - 13:01)
have been the second one and I started (13:00 - 13:04)
doing the QR stuff and I didn't know you (13:01 - 13:05)
were supposed to talk to the person in (13:04 - 13:08)
the plaza before you signed up and so I (13:05 - 13:10)
did like twenty QR things I was like oh (13:08 - 13:12)
I guess none of these counted okay great (13:10 - 13:14)
I think it's a cool thing to get the (13:12 - 13:17)
community to you know go along with that (13:14 - 13:20)
and and do these group events I don't (13:17 - 13:22)
think the I don't think won the rewards (13:20 - 13:25)
are that great especially the the like (13:22 - 13:27)
the stretch goals they have it's like (13:25 - 13:29)
okay if you catch a twenty thousand (13:27 - 13:32)
Pokemon as a group you'll get two (13:29 - 13:34)
thousand play coins or whatever they're (13:32 - 13:36)
called but if you catch 40 thousand will (13:34 - 13:39)
give you one love ball that's like what (13:36 - 13:43)
one love ball guys come on I love a lot (13:39 - 13:45)
of Pokemon I need a lot of love balls (13:43 - 13:47)
that I think they should continue it I (13:45 - 13:48)
don't think that it's something they (13:47 - 13:50)
should get rid of but I think that that (13:48 - 13:52)
needs to be communicated better by the (13:50 - 13:54)
Pokemon company and I also think the (13:52 - 13:57)
rewards need to be better in that regard (13:54 - 14:01)
as well no vote for a Pokemon but the (13:57 - 14:03)
question is what is your favorite fairy (14:01 - 14:05)
type hmm I'm going to turn it back into (14:03 - 14:07)
a bug Pokemon and say I really like row (14:05 - 14:11)
bomb B which is bug fairy and sylveon is (14:07 - 14:13)
really cool you can't you can't you (14:11 - 14:15)
can't argue with an original the number (14:13 - 14:17)
want the very first fairy-type pokémon (14:15 - 14:22)
shown we got a vote for Scyther oh (14:17 - 14:24)
that's a great question which pokemon (14:22 - 14:27)
has been under promoted utilized / loved (14:24 - 14:30)
by the Pokemon company so obviously you (14:27 - 14:31)
have your Pikachu's in your Charizard (14:30 - 14:34)
which are kind of the four face of what (14:31 - 14:37)
Pokemon promotes then you have your (14:34 - 14:40)
Lucario which is also one of the Pokemon (14:37 - 14:44)
that gets pushed a lot and they kind of (14:40 - 14:46)
did that same thing with zoroark in (14:44 - 14:48)
generation five and I don't think Zora (14:46 - 14:52)
took off as well as as Lucario did but (14:48 - 14:53)
if you if you looked at how they did it (14:52 - 14:55)
they did they gave it the same kind of (14:53 - 14:58)
push there are just out of you know out (14:55 - 15:00)
of 700 Pokemon there are so many Pokemon (14:58 - 15:04)
not not pushed forward that should be (15:00 - 15:07)
I'm trying to think of a good one that (15:04 - 15:09)
they push Legendary's really hard it's (15:07 - 15:11)
weird though because they like push (15:09 - 15:13)
suicune and they push tend tie but they (15:11 - 15:15)
didn't push raikou like reich who got a (15:13 - 15:17)
movie afterwards but it wasn't it wasn't (15:15 - 15:20)
as like big as suicune in Pokemon (15:17 - 15:23)
forever or Raikou in Pokemon three the (15:20 - 15:27)
movie Pokemon should push a Pokemon they (15:23 - 15:29)
should push some far fetch because I (15:27 - 15:31)
can't get enough we gotta vote for (15:29 - 15:32)
Wurmple (15:31 - 15:34)
really some of you voted for whirlpool (15:32 - 15:36)
alright (15:34 - 15:40)
Star Wars or Star Trek I'm gonna get (15:36 - 15:43)
hate for this I'm gonna say Star Trek (15:40 - 15:47)
but can we get some cheers for Star Trek (15:43 - 15:51)
alright I'm worried what about Star Wars (15:47 - 15:55)
[Applause] (15:51 - 15:58)
we got a vote for a hair cross and the (15:55 - 16:02)
question is hotdog verse polish I'm an (15:58 - 16:05)
OG hotdog guy from the Gecko just (16:02 - 16:07)

does hare cross have a mega evolution (16:18 - 16:23)
yes it does (16:20 - 16:23)
the only question I'll get right today (16:24 - 16:31)
spinarak question is why are there so (16:27 - 16:34)
many beetles species why not spiders oh (16:31 - 16:40)
we got give at Galvin Chawla and Joel (16:34 - 16:45)
tick and ya ariados I can't say its name (16:40 - 16:47)
yeah I don't know I feel like we got (16:45 - 16:48)
most of the bugs we have a centipede (16:47 - 16:51)
yeah we got scolipede (16:48 - 16:55)
I don't like bugs so now no spiders (16:51 - 16:57)
needed we got a vote for a godless APOD (16:55 - 16:59)
I can't say that name (16:57 - 17:02)
no question speak of the devil we got to (16:59 - 17:05)
vote for scolipede what pokemon without (17:02 - 17:07)
an evolution light let me start that (17:05 - 17:09)
over what pokemon without an (17:07 - 17:11)
evolutionary line do you think deserves (17:09 - 17:14)
one man there's a lot so of course far (17:11 - 17:18)
fetch definitely so listen here (17:14 - 17:20)
what if far fetch evolved and it's (17:18 - 17:23)
leaked turned into like a samurai sword (17:20 - 17:26)
now we're talking it's already like (17:23 - 17:27)
halfway there to fit like the samurai (17:26 - 17:31)
theme especially the anime definitely (17:27 - 17:34)
teases that too episode like 21 or (17:31 - 17:36)
something when Farfetch'd debuted but (17:34 - 17:39)
far fetched deserves a mega evolution i (17:36 - 17:43)
would be opposed to seeing the the (17:39 - 17:45)
pikachu spin-offs like Emolga and denna (17:43 - 17:48)
day and Plusle minun i feel like they (17:45 - 17:50)
it's they could get evolutions at this (17:48 - 17:53)
point i mean you have you have Raichu (17:50 - 17:56)
and right you got a lot of a lot of push (17:53 - 17:59)
behind a lowland right - which I'm a big (17:56 - 18:02)
big fan of that we got a vote for (17:59 - 18:04)
Beedrill slash luck chuckle I don't know (18:02 - 18:07)
if you can vote twice uh-huh but the the (18:04 - 18:10)
question is why is Jen for the best Jen (18:07 - 18:14)
Jen Jen Thor is good that was that was (18:10 - 18:15)
like I said earlier that was the game (18:14 - 18:18)
that brought me into Pokemon I think Gen (18:15 - 18:21)
4 is great for what it accomplished but (18:18 - 18:24)
I don't think I would love a remake (18:21 - 18:26)
first off I definitely think we should (18:24 - 18:30)
see a diamond in Pearl I think that (18:26 - 18:33)
generation 5 6 & 7 took some risks and (18:30 - 18:34)
whether or not they paid off that's (18:33 - 18:35)
debatable (18:34 - 18:37)
I don't think Gen 4 took any risk though (18:35 - 18:38)
I think it was a very safe game and (18:37 - 18:41)
that's okay that's what I needed at the (18:38 - 18:43)
time but if they were to remake Gen 4 or (18:41 - 18:45)
bring back Gen 4 do whatever they do I (18:43 - 18:47)
definitely think that there would have (18:45 - 18:49)
to be some huge gimmick that is (18:47 - 18:53)
different than everything we see and the (18:49 - 18:55)
remake of generation 3 kind of did that (18:53 - 18:57)
and they did have they did add a delta (18:55 - 18:59)
episode at the end they added the flying (18:57 - 19:02)
on Latios and latias and stuff but (18:59 - 19:04)
generation 3 also felt like two steps (19:02 - 19:06)
back whereas in generation 6 we got (19:04 - 19:10)
character customization we got changing (19:06 - 19:11)
mostly character customization I just (19:10 - 19:13)
love being able to like mean (19:11 - 19:14)
in a Pokemon game and then generation (19:13 - 19:16)
three came and they took all that away (19:14 - 19:18)
in order to tell the story that they (19:16 - 19:22)
told a decade ago and I don't know if (19:18 - 19:24)
that works I'm sure that some people (19:22 - 19:27)
love it I have a lot of fondness for Gen (19:24 - 19:29)
4 and I've already played that game so (19:27 - 19:30)
give me Gen 4 but give me something new (19:29 - 19:33)
give me a reason to play that game again (19:30 - 19:37)
we gotta vote for Combee which I am a (19:33 - 19:40)
fan of why is life hard (19:37 - 19:40)
you got a vote for wheedle that's why I (19:44 - 19:50)
like this hard somebody's voting for (19:48 - 19:56)
weasel no wheels alright uh do you love (19:50 - 19:59)
the switch do you think Pokemon stars is (19:56 - 20:03)
a real thing great questions so I (19:59 - 20:06)
haven't intend to switch I love it I (20:03 - 20:08)
adore it I think it's everything that I (20:06 - 20:13)
wanted in in a console I don't commute (20:08 - 20:15)
through public transportation so when I (20:13 - 20:17)
Drive to work it's a 30-minute Drive in (20:15 - 20:20)
my car when I get home I'm usually (20:17 - 20:23)
playing like Wii U or ps4 or something (20:20 - 20:25)
that involves a TV so I actually don't (20:23 - 20:29)
use my 3s as much as I should but to (20:25 - 20:31)
have something like the switch and be (20:29 - 20:34)
able to play Zelda on my TV which is (20:31 - 20:36)
what I would prefer to play any game (20:34 - 20:38)
that just feels great but then to be (20:36 - 20:41)
able to take that to like c2e2 because I (20:38 - 20:42)
know that I'm going to be waiting for (20:41 - 20:43)
panels or I know there's downtime and be (20:42 - 20:46)
able to play it there or in my bed that (20:43 - 20:48)
is everything I want so if they were to (20:46 - 20:51)
bring a Pokemon game or anything like (20:48 - 20:54)
that that is the route I want to see (20:51 - 20:56)
especially I like Monster Hunter (20:54 - 20:58)
I think Monster Hunter would be perfect (20:56 - 21:02)
for the switch as for Pokemon stars (20:58 - 21:04)
Eurogamer reported on the switch and (21:02 - 21:06)
they got pretty much everything right (21:04 - 21:07)
prior to the switch being announced (21:06 - 21:09)
specs price (21:07 - 21:11)
release date your gamer was also the (21:09 - 21:14)
same publication that reported on stars (21:11 - 21:17)
so while I don't think it will be called (21:14 - 21:22)
stars I do believe that that is coming (21:17 - 21:24)
again I don't work for the put I don't (21:22 - 21:26)
work for the Pokemon company or anything (21:24 - 21:28)
but when you have a company like (21:26 - 21:30)
Eurogamer get pretty much everything (21:28 - 21:32)
right on switch and then also say hey (21:30 - 21:34)
there's making a Pokemon game okay yeah (21:32 - 21:36)
you could get it wrong but you got (21:34 - 21:38)
everything right so far so why so I (21:36 - 21:41)
guess I'd rather I want it to be true so (21:38 - 21:42)
that that seems tempting the other thing (21:41 - 21:45)
too is that people pulled the the game (21:42 - 21:48)
data from from Sun and Moon and the (21:45 - 21:50)
models and the character figures are (21:48 - 21:52)
really actually high-res and the 3ds (21:50 - 21:54)
doesn't support that obviously because (21:52 - 21:57)
the 3d S is six years old but I always I (21:54 - 21:59)
also found it weird that even on a new (21:57 - 22:03)
3ds that Pokemon Sun and Moon didn't run (21:59 - 22:06)
that well anytime you got into an ultra (22:03 - 22:08)
beast encounter or anytime you got into (22:06 - 22:10)
a like a doubles battle the frame rate (22:08 - 22:13)
really chugged and it's weird to think (22:10 - 22:17)
that Game Freak the number two (22:13 - 22:18)
best-selling franchise in the world (22:17 - 22:21)
Pokemon only followed by Mario would (22:18 - 22:23)
make a Pokemon game that didn't run as (22:21 - 22:27)
well as it could on the new 3ds (22:23 - 22:31)
without having another plan and so if it (22:27 - 22:34)
is true that Eurogamer reported on it (22:31 - 22:36)
and it is true that all these Pokemon (22:34 - 22:38)
models all these character figures all (22:36 - 22:40)
these towns are actually way more (22:38 - 22:43)
high-res than the 3ds can prove like why (22:40 - 22:45)
would you do that extra work if you (22:43 - 22:48)
don't if if you didn't have plans for a (22:45 - 22:50)
third version or a version on a (22:48 - 22:52)
different console so this is my opinion (22:50 - 22:55)
I wouldn't be surprised though if we if (22:52 - 22:57)
we saw a Pokemon stars or a Pokemon (22:55 - 22:59)
Eclipse or whatever they're calling it I (22:57 - 23:01)
would love to see that we haven't vote (22:59 - 23:02)
for genesect (23:01 - 23:05)
why is Rowlett the weakest a lowland (23:02 - 23:05)
starter (23:05 - 23:08)
no I don't think while it's that weak (23:05 - 23:10)
just how you use it (23:08 - 23:13)
he involves into a dead ghost owl that's (23:10 - 23:15)
pretty cool I again on the road for (23:13 - 23:22)
genesect catch up on pizza yes or no no (23:15 - 23:24)
there's like a cover there's Co people (23:22 - 23:30)
saying yes no yeah no I like how the non (23:24 - 23:31)

rather 10 best Pokemon 2 9 favorite (27:48 - 27:54)
Pokemon that aren't vanilluxe that's (27:51 - 27:57)
good we did ice I feel like vanilluxe (27:54 - 28:00)

guys have fantastic handwriting some not (28:06 - 28:10)
so much (28:08 - 28:12)
if Mewtwo there's no vote for a Pokemon (28:10 - 28:14)
here if Mewtwo can get a mega evolution (28:12 - 28:16)
why can't Darkrai (28:14 - 28:20)
Darkrai oh why was Pikachu put as the (28:16 - 28:23)
face of Pokemon okay two questions I (28:20 - 28:26)
don't I want to see more mega Pokemon (28:23 - 28:29)
so mega pokemons really great in the (28:26 - 28:31)
fact that it doesn't increase the (28:29 - 28:35)
Pokedex number so I would love to see (28:31 - 28:38)
more mega Pokemon it would be weird if (28:35 - 28:41)
they just stopped like hey here's 50 (28:38 - 28:43)
mega Pokemon guess what guys no more I (28:41 - 28:45)
could see them doing that though I also (28:43 - 28:46)
like a lull in Pokemon I like the fact (28:45 - 28:50)
again that who would have thought like a (28:46 - 28:52)
year ago people would be people would be (28:50 - 28:55)
saying executor was really cool like no (28:52 - 28:57)
one said that a year ago and then they (28:55 - 28:59)
were like hey here's executor but it's (28:57 - 29:02)
7,000 feet tall and it's dragon and (28:59 - 29:04)
everyone lost their mind and I think (29:02 - 29:06)
that's incredible and the same for like (29:04 - 29:09)
Sandshrew and sandslash and Vulpix and (29:06 - 29:10)
nine tails of course there's going to be (29:09 - 29:12)
your yourse and true and your Vulpix (29:10 - 29:14)
lovers and they're there they're out (29:12 - 29:17)
there but not everyone was talking about (29:14 - 29:18)
those Pokemon they're not like a Lucario (29:17 - 29:21)
we're a Charizard or a Pikachu and so to (29:18 - 29:24)
be able to take a mega Pokemon or to (29:21 - 29:26)
take in a lowland form or whatever they (29:24 - 29:27)
do in the future and apply that to older (29:26 - 29:29)
Pokemon and bring them back into the (29:27 - 29:31)
spotlight I think that's I think that's (29:29 - 29:33)
fantastic and I would love to see them (29:31 - 29:36)
continuing to do that why I was Pikachu (29:33 - 29:38)
put at the face of the company why is (29:36 - 29:42)
life hard alright (29:38 - 29:46)
