we got a big show there's an (2:08 - 2:12)
announcement we're gonna talk about that (2:10 - 2:14)
there are two parts of the announcement (2:12 - 2:15)
everyone forgot the first part of the (2:14 - 2:18)
announcement and then we're gonna do (2:15 - 2:18)
that (2:18 - 2:19)
and then we're gonna take a break and (2:18 - 2:21)
then we're going to talk about the story (2:19 - 2:24)
of the sword and shield DLC so if in (2:21 - 2:26)
over two weeks we'll spend about 45 (2:24 - 2:28)
seconds on it because that's how long (2:26 - 2:31)
story is and we'll move on so if you (2:28 - 2:32)
don't want spoilers we'll give you a (2:31 - 2:34)
warning for that although I'm sure if (2:32 - 2:35)
you're listening to this podcast you (2:34 - 2:37)
probably bought the sword and shield DLC (2:35 - 2:39)
you're probably already beat the story (2:37 - 2:41)
so I'm not too worried about that but (2:39 - 2:45)
jumping right into news there was a (2:41 - 2:47)
another there was two Nintendo directs (2:45 - 2:49)
one was the one that they did the (2:47 - 2:51)
morning of the aisle of armor to (2:49 - 2:53)
announce the aisle of armor and Pokemon (2:51 - 2:56)

part of the news was cafe makes is (3:35 - 3:40)

11 minute pokemon presents I think it (3:40 - 3:43)

be the amount of misinformation in the (4:05 - 4:11)
Pokemon world is what vast and has the (4:07 - 4:13)
Pokemon world changed so much that (4:11 - 4:17)
misinformation has spread I remember (4:13 - 4:19)

truck yeah yeah we've we've we've long (4:19 - 4:25)
since come from the days of false rumors (4:22 - 4:31)
to less false rumors the second part of (4:25 - 4:34)
the announcement was a brand new game (4:31 - 4:39)
called poke Pokemon unite yeah I would (4:34 - 4:42)
probably say they spent about a solid 65 (4:39 - 4:45)
seconds on the cafe mix announcement and (4:42 - 4:48)
then the the arrest was for Pokemon (4:45 - 4:50)
unite so it's brand new gaya I'm gonna (4:48 - 4:51)
read the press release I have four other (4:50 - 4:53)
articles pulled up regarding (4:51 - 4:56)
because there's a lot of dissect here (4:53 - 4:58)
there is a reason to be upset about this (4:56 - 5:01)
game there is a reason to not like this (4:58 - 5:04)
game and then there's the bunch of (5:01 - 5:07)
people that are optimistic about this (5:04 - 5:10)
because it is a brand new type of (5:07 - 5:13)
Pokemon game for the first time so the (5:10 - 5:15)
announcement says Pokemon unite (5:13 - 5:17)
announced for the Nintendo switch and (5:15 - 5:19)

in five on five team battles during the (6:32 - 6:38)
battles players will cooperate with (6:36 - 6:41)
teammates to catch pokemon level up and (6:38 - 6:43)
evolve their own pokemon and they will (6:41 - 6:45)
need to defeat their opponents pokemon (6:43 - 6:47)

the opposing team within an allotted (6:47 - 6:52)
time oh come on unite will be free to (6:49 - 6:55)

drifters cross fires arena of Valor (7:45 - 7:52)
which is a MOBA game available on switch (7:48 - 7:55)
and mobile probably the thing that mass (7:52 - 7:58)
or unite will be closest to and most (7:55 - 8:01)
recently Call of Duty mobile now let's (7:58 - 8:03)
talk about 10-cent 10-cent was launched (8:01 - 8:06)

hundreds of millions of users (8:33 - 8:35)
cross-platform (8:34 - 8:38)
interactive some of their games would be (8:35 - 8:40)
honor of Kings (8:38 - 8:43)
Hub G mobile and League elections I (8:40 - 8:45)
don't see how League is not a direct (8:43 - 8:47)
competitor to arena valor unless you (8:45 - 8:50)
speak across platforms they are direct (8:47 - 8:52)
competitors but they're made by the same (8:50 - 8:52)
company (8:52 - 8:55)
technically I will get to what $0.10 (8:52 - 8:57)
owns and makes because there's a lot (8:55 - 9:02)
more it goes a lot deeper than that (8:57 - 9:02)
dota 2 because then that's just that (9:03 - 9:08)
they're making League League of dota (9:06 - 9:11)
furthermore 10 cents actively (9:08 - 9:13)
collaborates with overseas games such as (9:11 - 9:15)
s EA netmarble (9:13 - 9:18)
supercell and more to form strategic (9:15 - 9:20)
partnerships to launch new games and (9:18 - 9:21)
then they go on about what (9:20 - 9:23)
Nintendo we know about a Nintendo we (9:21 - 9:24)
know about Pokemon the interesting (9:23 - 9:29)
things here is time I and pen set okay (9:24 - 9:31)
there's a lot of news articles regarding (9:29 - 9:34)
this put them aside for now they should (9:31 - 9:37)
Pokemon unite what you guys think Oh (9:34 - 9:40)
I mean I'm super excited I enjoy the (9:37 - 9:42)
occasional MOBA I have played League (9:40 - 9:45)
I have played dota I have played arena (9:42 - 9:49)
of Valor and as long as all the players (9:45 - 9:51)
of those games keep playing their own (9:49 - 9:53)
games and fresh nice people play pokemon (9:51 - 9:58)
unite everything will be fine no email (9:53 - 10:02)
mains in my Pokemon unite okay I don't (9:58 - 10:05)
know your mobile history can you explain (10:02 - 10:09)
to what well you have MOBA in history (10:05 - 10:11)
right well look we got to save your (10:09 - 10:13)
dialogue for the new masters update (10:11 - 10:18)
later oh man Wow no will hit me with it (10:13 - 10:20)
what is a moba i've never played ice (10:18 - 10:22)
pokemon unite looks cool what what do i (10:20 - 10:24)
what am i doing in this game how is it (10:22 - 10:27)
similar to league arena of Valor don't (10:24 - 10:30)
exactly the same as all of them yeah (10:27 - 10:34)
there's there's so not any variation and (10:30 - 10:36)
I mean it does seem to be very similar (10:34 - 10:38)
in a valour of all of them but basically (10:36 - 10:43)
you have a map it's it's like a mirror (10:38 - 10:45)
map both sides are the same there's (10:43 - 10:46)
nothing fancy on one side that the other (10:45 - 10:50)
side's not getting everybody starts from (10:46 - 10:52)
the far end of the map so like the far (10:50 - 10:55)
corner and you head out and you have (10:52 - 10:57)
little towers but it's not a tower (10:55 - 10:59)
defense game although you do have to (10:57 - 11:01)
defend your towers and your goal is to (10:59 - 11:05)
basically keep progressing from your (11:01 - 11:07)
corner of the screen to your opponent's (11:05 - 11:09)
corner of the screen to take out their (11:07 - 11:12)
home base in the final end of glorious (11:09 - 11:16)
explosiveness and typically there are (11:12 - 11:21)
three channels three routes across the (11:16 - 11:23)
map that are Harry Mary heard the term o (11:21 - 11:26)
lanes three lanes yes and then you have (11:23 - 11:29)
somebody who's a top a mid or a bottom (11:26 - 11:31)
and you know it's basically you know (11:29 - 11:34)
which characters typically you would you (11:31 - 11:35)
know put like a support (11:34 - 11:38)
character in one lane and you know a (11:35 - 11:40)
different kind of character in another (11:38 - 11:43)
Lane and there's also the jungle which (11:40 - 11:44)
is the part of the map that's not the (11:43 - 11:47)
lanes and you can usually find other (11:44 - 11:49)
things I think in this announcement they (11:47 - 11:51)
said that you can find other Pokemon on (11:49 - 11:54)
the map that aren't part of either team (11:51 - 11:58)
and when you destroy those or make them (11:54 - 12:01)
faint you get buffs buff is a big word (11:58 - 12:05)
in them okay get buffs for your team and (12:01 - 12:07)
so probably that's what's gonna happen (12:05 - 12:09)
in the jungle as you'll have your jungle (12:07 - 12:11)
person go out there find whatever (12:09 - 12:13)
Pokemon are wandering around knock them (12:11 - 12:15)
out and then get those buffs um (12:13 - 12:19)
there's usually minions I haven't seen (12:15 - 12:22)
any minions in in Pokemon unite which (12:19 - 12:26)
are sort of NPCs that just vary (12:22 - 12:30)
single-mindedly go from one base you go (12:26 - 12:31)
heading towards the other base and they (12:30 - 12:34)
start attacking towers whenever they get (12:31 - 12:35)
close to one so I'm not sure how that's (12:34 - 12:37)
gonna work out and there's also (12:35 - 12:41)
typically a store with equipment and you (12:37 - 12:44)
as you are playing the game you generate (12:41 - 12:46)
gold or whatever currency and it's like (12:44 - 12:48)
every sets each game right every game (12:46 - 12:51)
you start from zero you set what you (12:48 - 12:53)
want to purchase from the store which (12:51 - 12:55)
are upgrades that once you hit the (12:53 - 12:56)
certain amount of gold from destroying (12:55 - 12:58)
your enemy or other characters on the (12:56 - 13:01)
map then you can purchase those upgrades (12:58 - 13:04)
and equip them and they give you more (13:01 - 13:07)
advantages as you go there's a lot a lot (13:04 - 13:10)
of moving pieces in a MOBA but it's (13:07 - 13:11)
basically go from the left to the right (13:10 - 13:13)
take out as much as you can along the (13:11 - 13:16)
way okay a couple follow-up questions (13:13 - 13:18)
here Greg Field feel free to chime in (13:16 - 13:21)
are all mobile is five verse five or is (13:18 - 13:23)
this some weird thing that Pokemon (13:21 - 13:25)
unites doing I feel like they missed an (13:23 - 13:29)
opportunity on six verse six but maybe (13:25 - 13:31)
hey not a hundred percent sure but I (13:29 - 13:34)
think that sounds right five by five is (13:31 - 13:37)
is fairly common okay I don't I can't (13:34 - 13:40)
say for sure that it's all but I mean (13:37 - 13:42)
that's pretty that's like League and (13:40 - 13:44)
we're probably Public League is the (13:42 - 13:46)
biggest mobile right I think your dota (13:44 - 13:48)
friends would disagree with yeah but (13:46 - 13:48)
sure (13:48 - 13:53)
I mean they're they're both similar I (13:48 - 13:56)
mean they're both like as high up as the (13:53 - 13:58)
other like I couldn't tell you which (13:56 - 14:01)
makes more money so I think the ranking (13:58 - 14:07)
is league is the most toxic dota is like (14:01 - 14:10)
the people who got tired of playing (14:07 - 14:12)
league but still need to get that MOBA (14:10 - 14:15)
fix and arena Valor is everybody who (14:12 - 14:17)
wants to play MOBAs but doesn't have a (14:15 - 14:18)
good PC ok (14:17 - 14:22)
I played heroes of the storm that's not (14:18 - 14:25)
a real game is - what I'm looking at (14:22 - 14:30)
right now is League is at 300,000 people (14:25 - 14:33)
watching on Twitch and dota is at a (14:30 - 14:35)
hundred and sixty seven thousand (14:33 - 14:37)
watching on twitch twitch obviously the (14:35 - 14:39)
end-all indicator of a popularity of a (14:37 - 14:41)
game of course when they did the (14:39 - 14:44)
announcement I went to twitch (14:41 - 14:46)
shortly after because people were like (14:44 - 14:49)
oh Pokemon six years late to the mobile (14:46 - 14:51)
thing and League was number one on (14:49 - 14:53)
twitch at the time and dota was number (14:51 - 14:56)
four on Twitch at the time and I was (14:53 - 14:58)
like are they really that late there's a (14:56 - 15:01)
lot of people watching these games yeah (14:58 - 15:04)
six years is not the right yeah timeline (15:01 - 15:07)
because I was playing league in 2013 (15:04 - 15:11)
which is seven years (15:07 - 15:11)
scandal is is there even there even an (15:12 - 15:16)
argument I like yeah I get it (15:14 - 15:18)
you know battle Royals are very big you (15:16 - 15:21)
know MOBAs didn't exist 20 years ago (15:18 - 15:27)
when are we gonna get a Pokemon but as (15:21 - 15:30)
long as like the game play is good and (15:27 - 15:34)
adaptive I mean like they keep making (15:30 - 15:35)
shooters every year they keep making (15:34 - 15:38)
racing games every year so I don't the (15:35 - 15:42)
idea that the expiration date on the (15:38 - 15:45)
MOBA style game has come and passed is (15:42 - 15:49)
patently false right like like man (15:45 - 15:53)
knoweth find shooters they have you know (15:49 - 15:57)
anymore I mean I'm sorry (15:53 - 16:00)
colleges and universities are are just (15:57 - 16:03)
beginning to scratch the surface of (16:00 - 16:07)
MOBAs as eSports like real college is (16:03 - 16:08)
talking about starting up an eSports (16:07 - 16:10)
program they're talking MOBAs and (16:08 - 16:12)
they're talking for tonight but yeah (16:10 - 16:15)
MOBAs are in the mix yeah those (16:12 - 16:18)
competitive league thinks heck there's (16:15 - 16:21)
so much money in that I don't understand (16:18 - 16:25)
why people love it people love the 5x5 (16:21 - 16:28)
III I don't think I've ever played a (16:25 - 16:29)
MOBA (16:28 - 16:34)
Oh shame did you know i but install (16:29 - 16:36)
heroes of the storm back in the day (16:34 - 16:39)
that's not real I went through it I went (16:36 - 16:42)
to the tutorial and it was it was to (16:39 - 16:44)
handhold II you know I was like this (16:42 - 16:46)
reminds me too much of Sun and Moon I (16:44 - 16:48)
gotta move now I'm just kidding it just (16:46 - 16:51)
it just didn't it didn't grab me and I (16:48 - 16:52)
thought you know out of all of them (16:51 - 16:54)
heroes would grab me cuz I was at the (16:52 - 16:58)
time playing a lot of Diablo 3 but that (16:54 - 17:00)
you know I just it just didn't grab me (16:58 - 17:02)
I've definitely played team-based games (17:00 - 17:04)
and I think some people would some (17:02 - 17:06)
people were arguing me with me that (17:04 - 17:08)
overwatch was very MOBA II but I was (17:06 - 17:09)
like I just thought overwatch is like a (17:08 - 17:14)
team-based shooter um there's a MOBA the (17:09 - 17:17)
MOBA feel of overwatch in that I think (17:14 - 17:19)
that over I still has five players with (17:17 - 17:20)
one side in five players on the other or (17:19 - 17:23)
is it four I have five sounds right well (17:20 - 17:26)
I mean it's it's a battle arena yeah (17:23 - 17:30)
it's not in that same you know top-down (17:26 - 17:33)
it's not the top down but it does have (17:30 - 17:35)
the similar like you're on a team you (17:33 - 17:37)
have objectives to get their points to (17:35 - 17:41)
connect to and you have to defend things (17:37 - 17:45)
I mean is it has some of the standard (17:41 - 17:49)
MOBA yeah without me being an actual (17:45 - 17:52)
MOBA I bought overwatch played it for a (17:49 - 17:54)
sum total of five minutes and said this (17:52 - 17:56)
game is not for me goodbye sixty dollars (17:54 - 17:58)
and so that's about as much as I know (17:56 - 18:01)
I've watched a lot of videos of people (17:58 - 18:04)
playing it but I knew when it wasn't (18:01 - 18:07)
when over art wasn't the next World of (18:04 - 18:11)
Warcraft MMO and that it was not at all (18:07 - 18:14)
what they had said it was going to with (18:11 - 18:15)
the type of game it was going to be and (18:14 - 18:18)
it became whatever watches would people (18:15 - 18:20)
love it but it just was absolutely not (18:18 - 18:22)
the game that I wanted I was like okay (18:20 - 18:24)
and people have people have a lot of fun (18:22 - 18:26)
with it but it just was never the game (18:24 - 18:28)
that I wanted Greg we didn't get your (18:26 - 18:30)
thoughts of the announcement I'm excited (18:28 - 18:32)
for it I think (18:30 - 18:36)
I've I've I've dabbled in the MOBA not a (18:32 - 18:40)
ton but I think any of the offshoot (18:36 - 18:42)
games where they just sort of try to (18:40 - 18:44)
expand out and see what fits and what's (18:42 - 18:46)
works it's it's certainly fun to see (18:44 - 18:48)
them playing with new ideas it could be (18:46 - 18:50)
hot garbage it could be a lot of fun (18:48 - 18:52)
there is something about playing the (18:50 - 18:53)
Pokemon and capturing at the Pokemon and (18:52 - 18:56)
sort of having a team aspect that (18:53 - 18:57)
doesn't exist in any other book of my (18:56 - 19:00)
product that has me excited to try (18:57 - 19:03)
Pokemon unite yeah that was when I saw (19:00 - 19:05)
it I was like wow this this looks cool (19:03 - 19:06)
MOBA never played a mobile that's my (19:05 - 19:08)
opportunity to play MOBA don't know if I (19:06 - 19:10)
like MOBAs but I really saw it as equal (19:08 - 19:14)
to like pokken tournament yeah when (19:10 - 19:15)
Poquelin they showed poking tournament I (19:14 - 19:16)
was like man I don't like fighting games (19:15 - 19:18)
but this looks rad I can play Chandeleur (19:16 - 19:22)
I can play suicune I can play Weavile (19:18 - 19:25)
and then I played it and I was like I'm (19:22 - 19:27)
glad they made this I'm glad you know (19:25 - 19:29)
somebody liked this I didn't like this (19:27 - 19:32)
but because I didn't like this I need to (19:29 - 19:34)
run to the Internet and let everyone (19:32 - 19:38)
know that I did not like this product I (19:34 - 19:42)
really wanted to like poke in tournament (19:38 - 19:44)
but I just don't like fighting games (19:42 - 19:46)
I enjoyed poking tearing it for what you (19:44 - 19:47)
know for what it was but fighting games (19:46 - 19:49)
don't remain Jam so I played it for as (19:47 - 19:51)
long as I played it and then left yeah I (19:49 - 19:54)
think I put probably 12 15 hours in a (19:51 - 19:58)
pokken tournament wouldn't mmm you know (19:54 - 20:03)
me if it but on Wii U we talked about (19:58 - 20:05)
how pokken tournament so let two point 1 (20:03 - 20:08)
million copies on switch which is very (20:05 - 20:10)
good yep actually as we're recording (20:08 - 20:12)
this they're doing the pokin player cup (20:10 - 20:15)
world champion this weekend and I try to (20:12 - 20:17)
watch a little bit of it and even though (20:15 - 20:19)
I like Pokemon and I understand how (20:17 - 20:21)
pokken tournament works I was not very (20:19 - 20:24)
interested in watching it hey some (20:21 - 20:26)
people like that and that's kind of (20:24 - 20:29)
where I I see I see unites right I'm (20:26 - 20:31)
gonna try unite it's free yeah I have (20:29 - 20:33)
nothing to lose you know if it was 20 (20:31 - 20:34)
bucks maybe 60 bucks I'd probably even (20:33 - 20:36)
purchase it and give it a try and then (20:34 - 20:39)
you know if I don't like it I just move (20:36 - 20:40)
on with life there's plenty of Pokemon (20:39 - 20:42)
games in my opinion that I do not like (20:40 - 20:44)
and that I've been very vocal about on (20:42 - 20:46)
the show Pokemon do (20:44 - 20:49)
for example Pokemon Rumble rush demon (20:46 - 20:52)
give that a try uh you know I didn't (20:49 - 20:55)
like auras when I first came out I've (20:52 - 20:57)
slightly changed my mind on that game (20:55 - 21:00)
over time but to me if you don't like a (20:57 - 21:03)
Pokemon game it's very easy to ignore it (21:00 - 21:06)
I think okay so let's get to the the (21:03 - 21:08)
complaint wait wait let me tell you (21:06 - 21:10)
first off before we get into that the (21:08 - 21:12)
top three things you're going to hear (21:10 - 21:15)
when you start playing pokemon unite (21:12 - 21:17)
guaranteed okay I'm not going to say (21:15 - 21:18)
it's in this order but these are the top (21:17 - 21:23)
three things number one why are you (21:18 - 21:25)
playing that Pokemon wrong okay (21:23 - 21:30)
alright number two why are you playing a (21:25 - 21:32)
Pokemon that you clearly don't know how (21:30 - 21:36)
to play okay yep number three I'm (21:32 - 21:38)
reporting you for poor sportsmanship (21:36 - 21:40)
just because you're not a good player (21:38 - 21:41)
okay (21:40 - 21:45)
what can I add a number four who's your (21:41 - 21:47)
main why are you not playing Charizard (21:45 - 21:49)
yeah and when chars learns not on the (21:47 - 21:52)
screen we need to ask where his heart is (21:49 - 21:56)
okay simpsons okay do we even know the (21:52 - 22:00)
lineup for unite yet like do we know (21:56 - 22:02)
everything that's in unite we know a (22:00 - 22:04)
handful of Pokemon I can name them for (22:02 - 22:06)
you we know that there's Blastoise Venus (22:04 - 22:10)
or Charizard timeframe okay we have (22:06 - 22:12)
Gengar Machamp and Snorlax (22:10 - 22:17)
we have Pikachu clefable which I'm into (22:12 - 22:18)
Kofi probably the weirdest one out of (22:17 - 22:19)
the bunch (22:18 - 22:21)
Lucario of course you know they don't (22:19 - 22:23)
they got to keep pushing Lucario the (22:21 - 22:26)
Roman reigns of Pokemon and talonflame (22:23 - 22:28)
is the ones we've seen so far (22:26 - 22:32)
talonflame is way overpowered Chinese we (22:28 - 22:34)
got oh here number for somebody nerf (22:32 - 22:37)
talonflame yeah nerf talonflame nerf so (22:34 - 22:40)
we have to assume given by the gameplay (22:37 - 22:43)
that we saw that they all start in their (22:40 - 22:46)
base lowest form because part of the (22:43 - 22:48)
gameplay was leveling up right you they (22:46 - 22:49)
they specifically said in the trailer (22:48 - 22:51)
you know you start out level 1 you will (22:49 - 22:52)
evolve and level up throughout they saw (22:51 - 22:55)
a Charmander evolve into a term e lien (22:52 - 22:57)
by knocking out something in the jungle (22:55 - 23:00)
I think and then (22:57 - 23:01)
eventually it was a Charizard I don't (23:00 - 23:02)
know how that works for Snorlax or (23:01 - 23:05)
Pikachu so but I mean do you think it's (23:02 - 23:08)
gonna be like munchlax to Snorlax Pichu (23:05 - 23:11)
- Pikachu's dry - yeah they're gonna be (23:08 - 23:13)
some that just start at level 1 at their (23:11 - 23:15)
full powered form which is going to (23:13 - 23:17)
create a problem I know that that's a (23:15 - 23:20)
thing in league and dota right you start (23:17 - 23:22)
at level 1 every game and you yeah you (23:20 - 23:26)
get stuff so I would assume that you (23:22 - 23:27)
start out like riolu and then you go to (23:26 - 23:31)
Luke re that's what I would guess so (23:27 - 23:33)
cleffa Clefairy kill fable that's my (23:31 - 23:35)
main I know how to play it I using (23:33 - 23:39)
unique strategy when I can finally power (23:35 - 23:41)
up and go off you will all be impressed (23:39 - 23:43)
stop harassing it's called ulting when (23:41 - 23:46)
you use your halt and we don't know that (23:43 - 23:49)
there's alt in here yet it is the R key (23:46 - 23:54)
on your keyboard they did they (23:49 - 23:56)
specifically said like each Pokemon will (23:54 - 23:58)
have like a superpower thing that will (23:56 - 24:00)
determine the Matt I'm like okay it's no (23:58 - 24:02)
it's gonna have an all alt so the (24:00 - 24:04)
complaints the the issues here there (24:02 - 24:08)
there's like three specific complaints (24:04 - 24:11)
number one I don't I've played mobos I (24:08 - 24:13)
don't like MOBAs that's a completely (24:11 - 24:15)
fair complaint if you've you know you've (24:13 - 24:19)
played League you played her the arena (24:15 - 24:22)
valor you played dota you don't like it (24:19 - 24:25)
that's a super fair complaint but what (24:22 - 24:27)
are they complaining about just that (24:25 - 24:29)
because the promise is not a fair (24:27 - 24:30)
complaint if you're saying (24:29 - 24:33)
therefore this game shouldn't exist oh (24:30 - 24:35)
it's a complaint yeah I don't want I'm (24:33 - 24:37)
not gonna play this game because I don't (24:35 - 24:40)
like them but if it's used as I've seen (24:37 - 24:42)
it a lot saying and therefore they (24:40 - 24:44)
should have never have made this game (24:42 - 24:46)
that is not a valid complaint because (24:44 - 24:48)
you don't like it doesn't mean it should (24:46 - 24:50)
have been created right yes (24:48 - 24:52)
correct but it you know if somebody came (24:50 - 24:54)
into my stream or whatever and they're (24:52 - 24:56)
like and I'm there like I'm bummed or (24:54 - 24:58)
like ah the announcement didn't do it (24:56 - 24:59)
for me and I was like oh what did you (24:58 - 25:00)
like what was the issue with the (24:59 - 25:02)
announcement they're like I you know I (25:00 - 25:03)
played a lot of League I just don't care (25:02 - 25:07)
about MOBAs anymore that's fine it's (25:03 - 25:08)
fine there's nothing wrong with that (25:07 - 25:10)
complaint number two is it wasn't (25:08 - 25:13)
whatever remake in the entire world the (25:10 - 25:16)
it wasn't let's go Merrill it wasn't hey (25:13 - 25:20)
you girafarig it wasn't Pokemon Z it (25:16 - 25:23)
wasn't sparkling diamond flashy pearl it (25:20 - 25:27)
wasn't any remake but Steve in the last (25:23 - 25:30)
week's trailer they had a chikorita and (25:27 - 25:35)
a Reiko behind Ishihara and obviously (25:30 - 25:39)
because they had gen 2 plushies and I (25:35 - 25:40)
ignore the fact that they had literally (25:39 - 25:42)
had Gen 1 plushies and gen 7 plushies (25:40 - 25:44)
and everything else but if I only focus (25:42 - 25:47)
on the gen 2 plushies Greg why am I (25:44 - 25:51)
being attacked why was there no hey you (25:47 - 25:55)
merrill to remake did you not see the (25:51 - 25:58)
suicune behind him I did and that just (25:55 - 26:02)
says that suicune is in Pokemon unite (25:58 - 26:04)
all those Pokemon that were shown back (26:02 - 26:07)
there are playable Pokemon in Pokemon (26:04 - 26:09)
unite you just drew the wrong conclusion (26:07 - 26:11)
so this is this is a huge complaint (26:09 - 26:13)
people were people set their own (26:11 - 26:16)
expectations they overhyped it I the (26:13 - 26:18)
mental gymnastics of people being like (26:16 - 26:21)
this announcement would have been better (26:18 - 26:25)
if they didn't make us wait a week is a (26:21 - 26:28)
really weird complaint of like because (26:25 - 26:30)
they made us wait a week (26:28 - 26:32)
poor you what did you did you camp (26:30 - 26:35)
outside for a week did you like not (26:32 - 26:36)
leave your house because you were so (26:35 - 26:38)
enthralled with insight like excitement (26:36 - 26:41)
that it them saying you have to wait a (26:38 - 26:44)
week for more news possibly affected (26:41 - 26:48)
your day-to-day life look I have not (26:44 - 26:52)
slept that's a week waiting for my Johto (26:48 - 26:56)
remakes Gen 20 and I didn't get them and (26:52 - 26:58)
therefore the Pokemon company hates me I (26:56 - 27:01)
just don't buy the excuse of like well (26:58 - 27:02)
if they didn't wait a week people (27:01 - 27:04)
wouldn't have been as mad like I just (27:02 - 27:07)
say what I think would have been as mad (27:04 - 27:10)
the Pokemon company needs to listen to (27:07 - 27:13)
some more Lana Del Ray hope is a (27:10 - 27:14)
dangerous thing for a woman like me (27:13 - 27:17)
right can't lie can't get people hope (27:14 - 27:20)
and then yank that rug out from under (27:17 - 27:22)
their feet I rewatched the original (27:20 - 27:25)
present and they just said we have a big (27:22 - 27:26)
announcement next week that's all they (27:25 - 27:27)
said (27:26 - 27:29)
and then all they said on Twitter they (27:27 - 27:31)
said hey just a reminder Pokemon (27:29 - 27:33)
announcement on Wednesday hey what did (27:31 - 27:35)
you like just say to go to the lengths (27:33 - 27:38)
of saying oh this is this is game freaks (27:35 - 27:40)
fault also not games freaks fault (27:38 - 27:42)
because they they had nothing to do with (27:40 - 27:44)
announcement a and announcement B but (27:42 - 27:47)
this is the Pokemon company's fault that (27:44 - 27:49)
they overhyped it and now we're upset (27:47 - 27:54)
Walt there's no even if they were even (27:49 - 27:55)
if you believe for a second they (27:54 - 27:57)
overhyped it what did you want them to (27:55 - 27:59)
say at the end of the present the (27:57 - 28:00)
conference we got a big announcement (27:59 - 28:03)
next week or hey we got some average old (28:00 - 28:05)
game made by a Chinese company next week (28:03 - 28:07)
uh some of you will like it something (28:05 - 28:08)
you won't see you then like what do you (28:07 - 28:12)
then these out zero companies in the (28:08 - 28:13)
entire world (28:12 - 28:17)
do not say is not a big announcement (28:13 - 28:20)
zero companies Amazon will say we have a (28:17 - 28:22)
big announcement next week you know what (28:20 - 28:25)
it is we put a LexA in a toaster done (28:22 - 28:28)
big animated I'm sure I am actually sure (28:25 - 28:34)
that product is the Pokemon company is (28:28 - 28:38)
the same company let me tell you 2016 (28:34 - 28:41)
the World Championship they said we have (28:38 - 28:43)
a big announcement does anyone remember (28:41 - 28:44)
what that big announcement was I (28:43 - 28:49)
remember what it is I know 2015 2016 I (28:44 - 28:51)
reverse the ground championship well (28:49 - 28:53)
didn't I I don't think they have Blatter (28:51 - 28:57)
no DC no that was to go Hawaii I think (28:53 - 29:00)
Hawaii well maybe it was after anyways (28:57 - 29:01)
it was the Year Sun and Moon came out in (29:00 - 29:05)
November Slowbro their big (29:01 - 29:06)
announcement then that's what they said (29:05 - 29:08)
they said we have a big announcement at (29:06 - 29:10)
Worlds their big announcement was they (29:08 - 29:13)
showed row brawler that was their big (29:10 - 29:15)
announcement at the World Championship (29:13 - 29:17)
they showed one new Pokemon not even (29:15 - 29:18)
that cool of a Pokemon was crew brawler (29:17 - 29:22)
this is not a new pattern or thing that (29:18 - 29:24)
the Pokemon company has done I would (29:22 - 29:27)
argue that showing a brand new Pokemon (29:24 - 29:30)
is a big announcement heads I think is (29:27 - 29:31)
pretty big they showed a brand new (29:30 - 29:33)
Pokemon never before seen at the World (29:31 - 29:33)
Championship (29:33 - 29:36)
I would also go on the record saying (29:33 - 29:39)
showing a brand new Pokemon video game (29:36 - 29:41)
is a big announcement (29:39 - 29:43)
whether or not you left it in the record (29:41 - 29:45)
put it in the record official statement (29:43 - 29:47)
and testimony this will be used against (29:45 - 29:49)
you in the court of Pokemon law I will (29:47 - 29:51)
have you know I just don't buy that like (29:49 - 29:53)
because they made us wait a week because (29:51 - 29:56)
I had to get up at 6:00 a.m. uh in (29:53 - 29:58)
California to watch this and it was 11 (29:56 - 30:00)
minutes long because it was because they (29:58 - 30:02)
used the word big announcement that this (30:00 - 30:06)
is their fault that people are mad it is (30:02 - 30:10)
not you okay life lesson (30:06 - 30:12)
you all are control of your own emotions (30:10 - 30:15)
and the stories that you tell yourselves (30:12 - 30:18)
if the story that you told yourself over (30:15 - 30:19)
a week is that you are going to get (30:18 - 30:22)
exactly what you wanted you are telling (30:19 - 30:25)
yourself a false story and therefore you (30:22 - 30:27)
are mad that you lied to yourself for a (30:25 - 30:30)
week putting that on somebody else is (30:27 - 30:32)
called projecting stop projecting your (30:30 - 30:35)
disappointment in your own manifestation (30:32 - 30:38)
of excitement that was based off of (30:35 - 30:41)
nothing on another company or another (30:38 - 30:45)
series of people also the statement that (30:41 - 30:48)
I can't believe Pokemon is wasting (30:45 - 30:50)
resources on a game that I don't want (30:48 - 30:54)
they are not making this game well gosh (30:50 - 30:55)
that we can do a whole nother podcast (30:54 - 30:59)
about how games a little like how like a (30:55 - 31:01)
half the Internet just think things (30:59 - 31:04)
making a game is so easy yeah I mean (31:01 - 31:05)
copy and paste (31:04 - 31:08)
it's just copy and paste get that what (31:05 - 31:10)
does that engine called unreal get the (31:08 - 31:13)
Unreal Engine pokemons in there and (31:10 - 31:14)
you're good to go (31:13 - 31:15)
yeah you just get the assets from (31:14 - 31:18)
Pokemon company you get the Unreal (31:15 - 31:20)
Engine from the Unreal company copy (31:18 - 31:24)
paste it prints cache we're we're also (31:20 - 31:27)
talking about the same fan base for (31:24 - 31:31)
probably the last five years the last (31:27 - 31:33)
time the Pokemon the last time Game (31:31 - 31:36)
Freak this is this is where the wording (31:33 - 31:39)
is is I this is where the wording is (31:36 - 31:41)
weird the last time Game Freak took off (31:39 - 31:47)
a year was in 2015 so 2016 with Sun in (31:41 - 31:50)
Sun and Moon 2017 ultra Sun and Moon (31:47 - 31:52)
2018 (31:50 - 31:55)
go Pikachu let's go Eevee 2019 sword and (31:52 - 31:59)
shield 2020 sword and shield DLC it took (31:55 - 32:04)
off 2015 and then in 2014 was Omega Ruby (31:59 - 32:08)
alpha sapphire in 2013 was X&Y so when (32:04 - 32:10)
we when we heard sword and shield when (32:08 - 32:11)
we when we were getting sword and shield (32:10 - 32:14)
one of the biggest complaints besides (32:11 - 32:16)
they cut my pokeman they cut my huntail (32:14 - 32:18)
I'm very upset I'm not buying this game (32:16 - 32:20)
how could they leave Clamperl and hunt a (32:18 - 32:23)
lout was there making games too fast (32:20 - 32:27)
specifically they as in Game Freak I've (32:23 - 32:28)
said that on this podcast before (32:27 - 32:31)
probably eight years ago I said I don't (32:28 - 32:33)
want Pokemon to be a Call of Duty I (32:31 - 32:35)
don't want in every I don't want Pokemon (32:33 - 32:40)
every single year if it's not quality so (32:35 - 32:43)
I've said these same words too so I also (32:40 - 32:45)
just don't understand this I feel like (32:43 - 32:47)
it's there's that there's a Venn diagram (32:45 - 32:50)
of people that vocally complained all (32:47 - 32:52)
through sword and shield that it was (32:50 - 32:53)
lazy it was rushed they're putting out (32:52 - 32:55)
games too quickly I'm more than willing (32:53 - 32:57)
to wait a year for a quality product and (32:55 - 33:00)
then I feel like the Venn diagram (32:57 - 33:09)
overlaps - so Argan shield is only like (33:00 - 33:13)
eight months old and we just got we just (33:09 - 33:19)
got brand new dlc two weeks ago slow (33:13 - 33:22)
down I don't think the Venn diagram (33:19 - 33:24)
overlaps this much this you're stating I (33:22 - 33:28)
think the general outrage when one group (33:24 - 33:30)
quiets down there is more than a happy (33:28 - 33:33)
another happy group to file right in and (33:30 - 33:35)
to continue that outrage level I don't (33:33 - 33:37)
think the people who are mad at national (33:35 - 33:39)
Ducks are suddenly like oh my gosh (33:37 - 33:41)
they're not giving me diamond and pearl (33:39 - 33:44)
remakes I think they've just gone off to (33:41 - 33:46)
sulk and then people who want their (33:44 - 33:48)
remakes who expect games every year who (33:46 - 33:50)
want that have filled in the power (33:48 - 33:53)
vacuum of complaining I mean there are a (33:50 - 33:55)
tremendous number of Pokemon fans out (33:53 - 33:57)
there rock can be cut into different (33:55 - 33:59)
groups of what we like to complain about (33:57 - 34:01)
I will I will tell you gen 3 fans might (33:59 - 34:02)
be my favorite (34:01 - 34:04)
hey they announced heartgold SoulSilver (34:02 - 34:06)
Gen 2 fans rejoice (34:04 - 34:09)
gen3 fans they came out of their cabins (34:06 - 34:11)
they looked at the sky and they said (34:09 - 34:15)
soon our time is coming and they were (34:11 - 34:17)
pretty loud they they went out they (34:15 - 34:19)
bought brand new trumpets they marched (34:17 - 34:21)
around for several years they finally (34:19 - 34:23)
got omega ruby set alpha sapphire and (34:21 - 34:25)
then they showed up we never heard from (34:23 - 34:26)
again under they went back into their (34:25 - 34:28)
cabins they put their trumpet under (34:26 - 34:31)
their bed they sat it on their their (34:28 - 34:34)
lazy boy recliner and they've been (34:31 - 34:36)
playing Omega Ruby alpha sapphire fit (34:34 - 34:38)
since we haven't seen them but the day (34:36 - 34:43)
every week the day that they announced (34:38 - 34:47)
Omega Ruby alpha sapphire every Gen 4 (34:43 - 34:50)
fanboy just shot up from their bed they (34:47 - 34:52)
put their pants on and they they they (34:50 - 34:55)
said my time is now here we go (34:52 - 34:58)
but during this time of this great war (34:55 - 35:01)
gen 3 people being happy and Gen 4 (34:58 - 35:03)
people being like it is our time now the (35:01 - 35:06)
gen 2 people go it's not good enough for (35:03 - 35:09)
us we're back we need another remake (35:06 - 35:12)
gold and silver and now we have gold and (35:09 - 35:15)
silver and diamond and pearl fans just (35:12 - 35:19)
clamoring for something new and ok I (35:15 - 35:22)
agree they need to remake gen 2 into a (35:19 - 35:25)
good game they do and the gen 5 fans are (35:22 - 35:27)
waiting but you my word (35:25 - 35:30)
they're all gonna crawl up ok know who (35:27 - 35:33)
had the underground bases that was four (35:30 - 35:36)
that's more those four Gen 4 Gen 4 needs (35:33 - 35:37)
to crawl back under the ground to the (35:36 - 35:39)
underground secret bases but at June 5 (35:37 - 35:44)
have 25 has a secret they had they had (35:39 - 35:46)
seasons they had good gameplay they had (35:44 - 35:49)
weed seas and they had the starting see (35:46 - 35:51)
ya night and day (35:49 - 35:54)
loaded TMS they had decent PC boxes man (35:51 - 35:56)
Gen 5 is a good game whoa (35:54 - 35:59)
now did now finally after all of my (35:56 - 36:02)
years of everything finally some (35:59 - 36:05)
recognition yes this is this is the (36:02 - 36:07)
thing we're gonna hear once once Gen 4 (36:05 - 36:09)
remakes are announced this gen fives are (36:07 - 36:11)
gonna be like finally you people can (36:09 - 36:14)
appreciate the depression we've been (36:11 - 36:18)
living in for it's my season so that (36:14 - 36:19)
didn't happen (36:18 - 36:22)
and you know that could have happened (36:19 - 36:25)
right they announced Ultra Sun ultramoon (36:22 - 36:29)
pretty quickly after Sun and Moon but I (36:25 - 36:31)
and I don't know if we said this last (36:29 - 36:34)
week or I said this last week could they (36:31 - 36:37)
have announced a a remake of an old game (36:34 - 36:40)
yeah sure they could literally announced (36:37 - 36:42)
a tooth-brush game last week like they (36:40 - 36:46)
could announce anything but I think it's (36:42 - 36:48)
really important from a company (36:46 - 36:51)
perspective if you're going to do DLC (36:48 - 36:54)
for the first time you don't announce (36:51 - 36:55)
another game that could possibly (36:54 - 36:58)
conflict with that right especially when (36:55 - 37:00)
you have stockholders that are looking (36:58 - 37:04)
at your at your products and they the (37:00 - 37:06)
stockholders probably would be like what (37:04 - 37:08)
about a new game because we know what (37:06 - 37:11)
that does we know that a third version (37:08 - 37:14)
of a game moves millions and millions of (37:11 - 37:16)
copies I feel like it's just very (37:14 - 37:18)
important for them to focus this year on (37:16 - 37:21)
the DLC and you know maybe and maybe (37:18 - 37:23)
tomorrow they announced diamond and pro (37:21 - 37:24)
remakes so they could do whatever they (37:23 - 37:27)
want but it's it's gonna come eventually (37:24 - 37:29)
look they're going to make Jenna they're (37:27 - 37:30)
gonna make Jen ten games they're gonna (37:29 - 37:31)
make Jen eleven games they're gonna (37:30 - 37:34)
remake Jen six they're gonna remake Jen (37:31 - 37:35)
seven they're gonna remake gen8 all of (37:34 - 37:36)
these things will eventually be coming (37:35 - 37:38)
because it's been proven time and time (37:36 - 37:41)
again that it that it works last thing I (37:38 - 37:43)
want to say before we get to 0.3 which (37:41 - 37:47)
is the ten cent issue is the the people (37:43 - 37:48)
that are like they should have switched (37:47 - 37:51)
snap and this game and I wholeheartedly (37:48 - 37:55)
disagree with that there is no way may (37:51 - 37:58)
snap will probably sell four million (37:55 - 37:59)
copies (37:58 - 38:00)
it will probably do much much better (37:59 - 38:03)
than pokken tournament but pokemon unite (38:00 - 38:05)
will probably make four million dollars (38:03 - 38:07)
in the first week didn't-didn't masters (38:05 - 38:09)
make like 23 million in the first month (38:07 - 38:11)
I think yeah even better than that let (38:09 - 38:15)
me tell you 100% what were we're not (38:11 - 38:17)
seeing this behind the curtain pokken (38:15 - 38:19)
tournament was supposed to be Pokemon (38:17 - 38:21)
eSports and nobody wanted it guess what (38:19 - 38:25)
Pokemon unite will be Pokemon eSports (38:21 - 38:27)
and they're banking on makin Jabez (38:25 - 38:31)
brazil's Dillion dillion's out of having (38:27 - 38:33)
competitive tournaments and (38:31 - 38:35)
people buying tickets and all the hype (38:33 - 38:37)
that's gonna go around that absolutely (38:35 - 38:40)
they didn't even announce like holiday (38:37 - 38:42)
2024 snap I don't think that games (38:40 - 38:45)
coming out this year no I think we wrote (38:42 - 38:48)
I think we roll into a beta slash early (38:45 - 38:51)
program for or this is this is actually (38:48 - 38:53)
what I think because there were some (38:51 - 38:54)
people saying that this shouldn't have (38:53 - 38:56)
been its own trailer and I think those (38:54 - 38:57)
people are wrong and I think those (38:56 - 38:59)
people forgot that they did like a (38:57 - 39:02)
two-minute silhouette of a bunch of (38:59 - 39:04)
people trading cards linking their game (39:02 - 39:08)
boys battling battling their cards (39:04 - 39:10)
playing pokken tournament and I don't (39:08 - 39:13)
know 18 different scenes of people (39:10 - 39:14)
cheering at world tournaments there's (39:13 - 39:17)
not a doubt in my mind that this trailer (39:14 - 39:19)
was supposed to be for the 2020 World (39:17 - 39:21)
Championship that day they showed (39:19 - 39:23)
there's not a single doubt that this (39:21 - 39:26)
wasn't that this was like some tacked-on (39:23 - 39:28)
thing that they did last-minute no I'm (39:26 - 39:30)
confident and they'll never they'll (39:28 - 39:32)
never say this the Pokemon company will (39:30 - 39:33)
never admit this that this trailer was (39:32 - 39:35)
meant for the World Championship they (39:33 - 39:36)
were going to show it to a bunch of (39:35 - 39:38)
people at the World Championship that (39:36 - 39:40)
are excited for battle and it would have (39:38 - 39:43)
went over extremely well but instead (39:40 - 39:45)
there was a bunch of crybabies that woke (39:43 - 39:47)
up at 6 a.m. and they saw the trailer (39:45 - 39:49)
and it wasn't what they wanted and now (39:47 - 39:50)
they had to scream on the internet that (39:49 - 39:52)
they had to do some sort of mental (39:50 - 39:54)
gymnastics of how how this was the worst (39:52 - 39:55)
thing in the entire world and the (39:54 - 39:57)
Pokemon company will cease to exist in (39:55 - 39:59)
two weeks because of this announcement (39:57 - 40:02)
last part of this argument of why people (39:59 - 40:07)
were maybe upset the 10 cent deal it was (40:02 - 40:10)
56,000 dislikes whatever that's worth (40:07 - 40:12)
nothing three million people watched it (40:10 - 40:15)
a hundred and fifty six million dislikes (40:12 - 40:17)
is a drop in the bucket to three million (40:15 - 40:19)
whatever doesn't none of that matters (40:17 - 40:22)
beside the talking point I guess so ten (40:19 - 40:25)
cent is it ten cent is like if you don't (40:22 - 40:27)
know ten cent I'll try to explain it as (40:25 - 40:30)
easy as possible ten cent is like Amazon (40:27 - 40:34)
and Microsoft and Disney all merged into (40:30 - 40:35)
a company and made pretty much (40:34 - 40:39)
everything music games Home Shopping (40:35 - 40:42)
Network it's just basically Disney yeah (40:39 - 40:45)
in its own right there yeah 10/7 is a (40:42 - 40:48)
very very very big Chinese company if we (40:45 - 40:52)
if we take a step out Pokemon recently (40:48 - 40:55)
made their first attempt in China with (40:52 - 40:58)
Sun and Moon that was the first games (40:55 - 41:02)
with traditional and simplified chinese (40:58 - 41:04)
mandarin and cantonese cantonese (41:02 - 41:08)
cantonese cantonese cantonese thank you (41:04 - 41:11)
that's not to say you know somebody in (41:08 - 41:15)
China didn't import a game right (41:11 - 41:18)
but right putting games on shelves there (41:15 - 41:22)
so even if you think for a second that (41:18 - 41:25)
you Knight was not made for you there (41:22 - 41:28)
there are fans in other countries (41:25 - 41:31)
besides America spoiler Japan does have (41:28 - 41:34)
internet there are Pokemon fans all over (41:31 - 41:38)
the world specifically in China so it is (41:34 - 41:40)
possible that the Pokemon company (41:38 - 41:43)
doesn't care about everyone else and (41:40 - 41:45)
specifically wants us to succeed in (41:43 - 41:48)
China that is possible but that doesn't (41:45 - 41:50)
necessarily mean it's a bad thing if (41:48 - 41:52)
Pokemon fans are still Pokemon fans (41:50 - 41:55)
regardless of where they live and there (41:52 - 41:57)
are limitations to play stuff in China (41:55 - 42:00)
and if this is their way to give those (41:57 - 42:04)
fans something more that's that's fine (42:00 - 42:06)
like that's the same thing with Pokemon (42:04 - 42:06)
smile (42:06 - 42:10)
I mean it's meant for little kids just (42:06 - 42:11)
because it's not meant for you doesn't (42:10 - 42:13)
mean it wasn't still a thing that they (42:11 - 42:17)
should have made but some people have a (42:13 - 42:20)
problem with $0.10 and I'm not here (42:17 - 42:23)
you defend $0.10 there's a lot of not (42:20 - 42:26)
great companies in the world but I can (42:23 - 42:28)
give you the history of tenza I can tell (42:26 - 42:31)
you what games they have made and they (42:28 - 42:34)
are they're the largest tech Kalama (42:31 - 42:37)
grant Kalama grant McCollum and glomer (42:34 - 42:40)
itch yes they're that in China they're (42:37 - 42:42)
the biggest one they are the world's (42:40 - 42:45)
largest video game publisher they both (42:42 - 42:47)
provide Internet and entertainment in (42:45 - 42:50)
China this ok so this is off PC gamer (42:47 - 42:54)
this was published October 4th 2019 so (42:50 - 42:56)
relatively recently we'll just go (42:54 - 42:57)
through this they are both the internet (42:56 - 42:59)
and entertainment giant in China they (42:57 - 43:01)
are the equivalent of a Facebook or a (42:59 - 43:03)
Google but gamers worldwide are probably (43:01 - 43:05)
more familiar with $0.10 investments in (43:03 - 43:07)
to a growing number of game developers (43:05 - 43:10)
and publishers they have 300 investments (43:07 - 43:11)
in their portfolio staying on top of (43:10 - 43:14)
every company that $0.10 has a stake in (43:11 - 43:17)
can be daunting so the author here is (43:14 - 43:19)
creative a list of $0.10 public (43:17 - 43:21)
investments in foreign gaming companies (43:19 - 43:23)
basically companies outside of China (43:21 - 43:26)
including where possible how much of the (43:23 - 43:28)
company Tencent owns alright so let's (43:26 - 43:32)
start with number one when I get games (43:28 - 43:36)
who makes League of Legends and they own (43:32 - 43:39)
a hundred percent of Riot Games so (43:36 - 43:41)
that's big League of Legends undoubtably (43:39 - 43:47)
a very very good game yep in 2011 10 (43:41 - 43:50)
cent went from being riots gaming (43:47 - 43:52)
publisher partner in China to the Madera (43:50 - 43:53)
and majority stake holder after paying (43:52 - 43:56)
400 million dollars for a 93 percent (43:53 - 43:58)
stake in League of Legends (43:56 - 44:01)
four years later $0.10 got the remaining (43:58 - 44:04)
7% for an undisclosed amount taking full (44:01 - 44:06)
control over Riot Games just as League (44:04 - 44:08)
of Legends was exploding as in eSports (44:06 - 44:10)
around the world and then League of (44:08 - 44:12)
Legends the most popular PC game in the (44:10 - 44:15)
world pulling an estimated 1.4 billion (44:12 - 44:19)
in revenue last year riot riot games (44:15 - 44:22)
remain remains largely free to steer the (44:19 - 44:25)
game how it pleases but that (44:22 - 44:27)
relationship has some ugly downsized (44:25 - 44:28)
wanting to cash in on the mobile game (44:27 - 44:31)
boom boom 10 cent tried to get riot to (44:28 - 44:33)
make a mobile version of lol (44:31 - 44:36)
when the developer refused $0.10 went (44:33 - 44:38)
ahead made their own mobile version (44:36 - 44:41)
clone of lol called arena of Valor that (44:38 - 44:43)
became one of the most popular mobile (44:41 - 44:46)
games in Asia riot was not happy about (44:43 - 44:47)
this (44:46 - 44:49)
that is now mostly water under the (44:47 - 44:52)
bridge now that 10-cent abandon arena (44:49 - 44:55)
valor in the West and riot is now making (44:52 - 44:58)
a mobile version of League of Legends so (44:55 - 45:00)
there's your first one now you can say (44:58 - 45:03)
Greg Steve will I don't play League of (45:00 - 45:06)
Legends this doesn't matter (45:03 - 45:09)
rod I'm never going to play a 10-cent (45:06 - 45:13)
game let's move on to number two because (45:09 - 45:15)
I guarantee you're using a 10 cent (45:13 - 45:19)
product at the end of this podcast Epic (45:15 - 45:23)
Games they own 40% 10 cent invested (45:19 - 45:25)
three hundred and thirty million dollars (45:23 - 45:29)
into Epic Games in 2012 triggering one (45:25 - 45:31)
of the most dramatic shifts in PC gaming (45:29 - 45:34)
in the last decade assuring a new era of (45:31 - 45:36)
free-to-play games (45:34 - 45:38)
epic scrapped Unreal Engine 4 monthly (45:36 - 45:40)
subscription in favor of a free version (45:38 - 45:43)
where epic earned royalties on sales the (45:40 - 45:47)
biggest epic game okay at the same time (45:43 - 45:49)
epic began experimenting with Live to (45:47 - 45:51)
services like Paragon and fortnight (45:49 - 45:54)
while both games uh or died save the (45:51 - 45:56)
world while both the games were failures (45:54 - 45:58)
save the world to put epic into a (45:56 - 46:00)
perfect spot to jump on the battle royal (45:58 - 46:02)
bandwagon almost by accident creating (46:00 - 46:03)
the biggest gaming pop-culture (46:02 - 46:05)
phenomenon since minecraft in Pokemon (46:03 - 46:08)
last year fortnight made 2.4 billion (46:05 - 46:10)
making it the most profitable game that (46:08 - 46:13)
year so now you say well Steve I don't (46:10 - 46:15)
play League of Legends I don't I don't (46:13 - 46:18)
play for it night I don't I can't even (46:15 - 46:22)
do that Flashdance Tencent owns 11.5% of (46:18 - 46:24)
blue hole which is players unknown (46:22 - 46:28)
battleground 10 cent owns both fortnight (46:24 - 46:31)
and a piece of both fortnight and pub g2 (46:28 - 46:33)
dominant battle Royales what's more (46:31 - 46:35)
amusing is that 10 cent also has the (46:33 - 46:37)
rights to publish both games in China (46:35 - 46:40)
meaning that it's actual it's an actual (46:37 - 46:42)
competition with itself not a bad place (46:40 - 46:44)
to be in 10 cents investment in Blue (46:42 - 46:47)
Hole became apparent in 2017 (46:44 - 46:50)
during 1.5% of blue hole and then (46:47 - 46:51)
increasing that for an undisclosed (46:50 - 46:55)
amount rumor to be about 10% it is (46:51 - 46:58)
rumored that $0.10 will be trying to it (46:55 - 47:00)
will is rumor that $0.10 is seeking a (46:58 - 47:02)
complete accusation of blue hole (47:00 - 47:05)
currently wait how much of Apex legends (47:02 - 47:09)
2 they own apex is EA will get there (47:05 - 47:14)
well let's go get there you look you (47:09 - 47:16)
don't like battle Royals I get it right (47:14 - 47:18)
you don't like the pup G you don't like (47:16 - 47:19)
the fortnight not interested in the (47:18 - 47:21)
League of Legends I like watching them (47:19 - 47:23)
what if I told you that $0.10 helped (47:21 - 47:27)
Ubisoft survive I don't play in a (47:23 - 47:29)
Ubisoft games that's not true (47:27 - 47:33)
they own 5% of Ubisoft at the time and (47:29 - 47:35)
they took it over from the vendee who at (47:33 - 47:37)
the time was Ubisoft's largest (47:35 - 47:40)
stakeholder for years Vivendi has (47:37 - 47:42)
steadily acquired a stake in Ubisoft (47:40 - 47:45)
hoping to aus its founders and seizing (47:42 - 47:47)
control for itself putting out thousands (47:45 - 47:49)
of jobs the situation looked grim (47:47 - 47:51)
Ubisoft struck a deal with vid than the (47:49 - 47:55)
vendee that saw the French conglomerate (47:51 - 47:58)
divest its stake in a variety of (47:55 - 48:00)
investors that included 10 cent as part (47:58 - 48:02)
of its agreement though 10 cent is just (48:00 - 48:04)
a silent partner that Inc cannot (48:02 - 48:07)
increase its voting rights in its (48:04 - 48:09)
ownership of Ubisoft making a hostile (48:07 - 48:11)
takeover by $0.10 impossible the (48:09 - 48:14)
acquisition of Ubisoft shared also the (48:11 - 48:17)
acquisition of Ubisoft shares also was a (48:14 - 48:20)
strategic partnership where $0.10 would (48:17 - 48:24)
publish Ubisoft games in China so if (48:20 - 48:26)
you're playing Assassin's Creed in China (48:24 - 48:29)
Tencent published it now Greg you stay (48:26 - 48:32)
away from all these games some would say (48:29 - 48:33)
that Ubisoft games I'm would say maybe (48:32 - 48:35)
you're a fan of the overwatch of the (48:33 - 48:37)
Diablo or the World of Warcraft even I (48:35 - 48:40)
left that I left that life behind (48:37 - 48:43)
well not 10 cents they own 5% of (48:40 - 48:46)
Activision Activision Blizzard how much (48:43 - 48:50)
have Square Enix do they own like this (48:46 - 48:52)
is a longer that's how we get Greg yeah (48:50 - 48:56)
so far so far you're batting zero years (48:52 - 48:58)
for your you deserve times that helped (48:56 - 49:00)
another company escape to the vendee act (48:58 - 49:02)
Blizzard Activision fell under vividness (49:00 - 49:05)
control back in 2007 when it merged in (49:02 - 49:06)
order to join forces with Blizzard (49:05 - 49:08)
benefiting from the enormous success of (49:06 - 49:11)
world Warcraft five years later the (49:08 - 49:12)
merged companies of Activision (49:11 - 49:15)
Blizzard's announced a deal to buy back (49:12 - 49:17)
the vendee stake in the company to (49:15 - 49:20)
become an independent and $0.10 jumped (49:17 - 49:22)
at the opportunity bought 5% of (49:20 - 49:24)
Activision Blizzard for an undisclosed (49:22 - 49:27)
amount there's another big game that I (49:24 - 49:29)
think will purse I personally think this (49:27 - 49:30)
game will get even bigger in the next (49:29 - 49:34)
year I don't think any of us play it 10 (49:30 - 49:37)
cent owns 80% of grinding Gear games (49:34 - 49:41)
which make half of Exile and I think (49:37 - 49:43)
packs of Exile hasn't exploded yet it's (49:41 - 49:45)
very very popular but I think it will (49:43 - 49:48)
get a lot bigger this year next year how (49:45 - 49:52)
much of garden escaped - they own 100% (49:48 - 49:56)
we're getting there so other investments (49:52 - 49:59)
worth noting supercell they make games (49:56 - 50:02)
like clash of clans clash royale boom (49:59 - 50:05)
beach $0.10 owns eighty four point three (50:02 - 50:08)
percent they investment leave them (50:05 - 50:10)
behind eight point six billion dollars (50:08 - 50:12)
into the finished mobile developer one (50:10 - 50:14)
of the biggest purchases in videogame (50:12 - 50:17)
history you know there's there's some (50:14 - 50:17)
fans out there (50:17 - 50:20)
they love the bayonetta they love the (50:17 - 50:23)
they love the what's the other game that (50:20 - 50:26)
people near automata they love the (50:23 - 50:27)
Platinum I hear this all the time (50:26 - 50:28)
platinum games they make good games (50:27 - 50:29)
guess what (50:28 - 50:33)
ten cents invested a undisclosed amount (50:29 - 50:36)
in platinum games ten cent owns an (50:33 - 50:37)
undisclosed amount as of February of (50:36 - 50:40)
2020 into jäger the developer of spec (50:37 - 50:44)
ops coca a South Korean entertainment (50:40 - 50:46)
enter entertainment and Internet company (50:44 - 50:50)
with the mega hit black desert online (50:46 - 50:53)
ten cent owns thirteen thirteen point (50:50 - 50:56)
five percent of that game paradox (50:53 - 50:58)
entertainment they own five percent of (50:56 - 51:03)
that they make hearts of iron to fat (50:58 - 51:06)
shark thirty / 6 percent of fat shark (51:03 - 51:09)
they make Warhammer that is the (51:06 - 51:12)
second-largest Swedish developer that's (51:09 - 51:14)
hence have invested in (51:12 - 51:17)
29% of fun come they make Conan exile as (51:14 - 51:19)
a secret world shark mob they own a (51:17 - 51:22)
hundred percent of that their studio (51:19 - 51:24)
that made they used to make the division (51:22 - 51:26)
and hitman they were fully bought by ten (51:24 - 51:28)
cent in 2019 (51:26 - 51:30)
I like the division that was a good game (51:28 - 51:32)
you're listening to this podcast you're (51:30 - 51:35)
like I hate ten cent I don't play League (51:32 - 51:36)
of Legends I don't play a supercell (51:35 - 51:40)
games I don't play path of Exile but you (51:36 - 51:41)
better believe I'm gonna complain on (51:40 - 51:46)
discord about Pokemon unite guess what (51:41 - 51:49)
discord received one hundred and fifty (51:46 - 51:51)
eight million dollars in funding (51:49 - 51:55)
including an undisclosed amount from ten (51:51 - 51:58)
cents that's where they got me that's (51:55 - 52:02)
okay I don't use discord I am on are (51:58 - 52:06)
slash are slash Pokemon complaining (52:02 - 52:09)
about ten cent (52:06 - 52:12)
hate to break it to you read it got a (52:09 - 52:13)
hundred and fifty million investment (52:12 - 52:15)
from ten seconds (52:13 - 52:20)
I thought reddit was owned by that (52:15 - 52:24)
magazine publisher they do Vogue and GQ (52:20 - 52:27)
oh goodness why did it just leap out of (52:24 - 52:30)
my brain Condon asked oh oh they're in (52:27 - 52:32)
trouble well maybe that's why they (52:30 - 52:33)
needed the investment yeah they needed (52:32 - 52:36)
the investment I have verified that (52:33 - 52:38)
garden escapes is made by play Rick's (52:36 - 52:41)
which has no involvement with ten cent (52:38 - 52:43)
so I think garden escapes is like still (52:41 - 52:46)
top ten most profitable mobile mobile (52:43 - 52:49)
games though I believe I certainly put a (52:46 - 52:52)
lot of money into it yeah so the whole (52:49 - 52:54)
point of that wasn't to like convince (52:52 - 52:57)
you that ten cents a good company you (52:54 - 52:59)
can do your own research about that a (52:57 - 53:02)
lot of fans that I saw over the week (52:59 - 53:05)
they they told me that they would never (53:02 - 53:09)
ever ever do anything that involved ten (53:05 - 53:12)
cent but ten senators surprised yeah (53:09 - 53:14)
surprised ten son is way more than just (53:12 - 53:18)
a couple very big video games they have (53:14 - 53:19)
their hand and read it they have their (53:18 - 53:23)
hand in discord and and leave they're (53:19 - 53:25)
called tendrils at this point they have (53:23 - 53:26)
long given up on the inefficiency of (53:25 - 53:30)
Hana and in five years when ten cent (53:26 - 53:31)
comes to America and they're battling (53:30 - 53:34)
Amazon Microsoft Apple and Disney for (53:31 - 53:37)
full ownership of our lives we'll (53:34 - 53:40)
remember this podcast battling is in (53:37 - 53:42)
quotes the amount of collusion that (53:40 - 53:44)
happens with all the big companies would (53:42 - 53:47)
shock you I hope that Pokemon unite is (53:44 - 53:49)
good I hope it's fun I hope it's I hope (53:47 - 53:51)
it's great I hope it's not super money (53:49 - 53:51)
grabby (53:51 - 53:54)
I believe in League of Legends and both (53:51 - 53:58)
dota there's no pay to win it's just you (53:54 - 54:00)
pay money for hats or skins I think dota (53:58 - 54:02)
is the Hat I'll get those skins man you (54:00 - 54:05)
don't get those skins I have to pick up (54:02 - 54:07)
Mane that has a bad shiny so I'm not (54:05 - 54:09)
tempted to buy it shiny skin don't know (54:07 - 54:12)
what it's like for a Rena Valor which I (54:09 - 54:13)
guess is probably the comparable one (54:12 - 54:15)
will I don't know if you played that one (54:13 - 54:17)
on switch I didn't play it (54:15 - 54:19)
enough to find out where it be throwing (54:17 - 54:21)
money but you can do all of these games (54:19 - 54:24)
you just jump into a 5v5 match right (54:21 - 54:26)
there's no like must pay a ninety nine (54:24 - 54:28)
cents to do your daily match or whatever (54:26 - 54:30)
that's correct (54:28 - 54:33)
and and to go back to the actual develop (54:30 - 54:36)
here time I you know I'm not huge a I'm (54:33 - 54:39)
not a huge Call of Duty fan but I've I (54:36 - 54:41)
heard call of duty mobile was pretty (54:39 - 54:42)
good (54:41 - 54:46)
oh those Call of Duty junkies will this (54:42 - 54:46)
remake Call of Duty what await that's (54:48 - 54:54)
our we spent a lot of time on unite (54:51 - 54:58)
there was lots of cover no date but I (54:54 - 55:00)
expected if there was to be a World (54:58 - 55:03)
Championship this year that they (55:00 - 55:05)
probably would have had kiosks kiosk is (55:03 - 55:08)
kiosks set up at the World Championship (55:05 - 55:12)
to play ah no no no if if you night came (55:08 - 55:15)
out before the World Championships I can (55:12 - 55:17)
guarantee you it would have been one of (55:15 - 55:19)
the competitive things because people (55:17 - 55:21)
are going to like the mobile folks are (55:19 - 55:23)
just gonna be like already there their (55:21 - 55:26)
fingers are on cue wer and on their (55:23 - 55:28)
Mouse there are good too although it's (55:26 - 55:30)
only mobile and switch isn't it boy (55:28 - 55:37)
arena valor is not I mean for me I died (55:30 - 55:39)
getting a long time to get the controls (55:37 - 55:42)
for destiny you like to click it so so (55:39 - 55:45)
this is this well before we take break (55:42 - 55:47)
last question so if you look at (55:45 - 55:49)
something like pokken tournament I don't (55:47 - 55:52)
know how many I don't know how many fans (55:49 - 55:55)
from like Mortal Kombat or dead or alive (55:52 - 55:58)
or Tekken I like Pokemon and I want to (55:55 - 56:00)
try new fighting game and moved over (55:58 - 56:04)
versus how many people that were like I (56:00 - 56:05)
don't really I'm not really in that (56:04 - 56:08)
scene but I like Pokemon and I'm in that (56:05 - 56:11)
scene so the same thing with unite are (56:08 - 56:15)
there going to be people who are who (56:11 - 56:18)
their life is League of Legends and they (56:15 - 56:20)
decide to try this and then just go back (56:18 - 56:23)
to League oh they'll they'll never leave (56:20 - 56:25)
Lee yeah once you're in league you don't (56:23 - 56:28)
ever get out that's that's just what I (56:25 - 56:30)
know in my example there's me who's (56:28 - 56:31)
never (56:30 - 56:34)
moba who's like I might like this and it (56:31 - 56:37)
might be a game that I play on a daily (56:34 - 56:40)
or weekly basis if I like it which is a (56:37 - 56:44)
big big if it's a big if I don't know (56:40 - 56:47)
what the crossover is though well I mean (56:44 - 56:49)
who knows like I'm sure there are people (56:47 - 56:52)
who casually play League of Legends wish (56:49 - 56:54)
they could be better at it but like it (56:52 - 56:56)
doesn't excite them and this will excite (56:54 - 56:58)
them they're getting in at the ground (56:56 - 57:00)
floor they get to be a part of the (56:58 - 57:02)
community like there'll be a certain (57:00 - 57:04)
amount of people who jump in and be like (57:02 - 57:06)
this is what I've been waiting for (57:04 - 57:08)
forever I've tried other mobile games (57:06 - 57:11)
but I'm just not yeah I'm so far but I (57:08 - 57:13)
feel like I'm so far behind because (57:11 - 57:14)
they've been out for so long like this (57:13 - 57:17)
is a fresh start for a lot of people and (57:14 - 57:19)
it could be huge it could I really tell (57:17 - 57:21)
you I'm gonna tell you what's gonna (57:19 - 57:24)
happen okay it's a cycle you're gonna (57:21 - 57:27)
get League players who and it's like (57:24 - 57:30)
every like a quarter a new fresh crop of (57:27 - 57:32)
these dudes show up where they're like (57:30 - 57:36)
I'm so tired of how toxic the league (57:32 - 57:38)
community is I can't stand I don't want (57:36 - 57:40)
to play this game II wear I've got to (57:38 - 57:42)
stop playing league and then there's but (57:40 - 57:44)
you know I can play pokemon unite (57:42 - 57:46)
because it's like League and it's not (57:44 - 57:47)
doesn't have that toxic and then they're (57:46 - 57:49)
gonna play that for three months and (57:47 - 57:50)
then they're gonna start jonesing again (57:49 - 57:54)
because you know the new skins came or (57:50 - 57:57)
they've got a new champion or something (57:54 - 57:58)
and then they're just gonna they're (57:57 - 58:01)
gonna like put Pokemon unite aside and (57:58 - 58:02)
then they're going to be back into (58:01 - 58:05)
League hardcore for six months and then (58:02 - 58:06)
they go oh my god this community is so (58:05 - 58:08)
toxic Lee players are the worst I can't (58:06 - 58:10)
leave you know again it to be six (58:08 - 58:12)
o'clock at night and all the little kids (58:10 - 58:14)
go for dinner and they're afk and I'm (58:12 - 58:16)
just like so frustrated everybody on my (58:14 - 58:18)
team sucks why are you playing a support (58:16 - 58:21)
main in that lane and why didn't you alt (58:18 - 58:23)
at that and then they but Pokemon unite (58:21 - 58:24)
is gonna be sitting there waiting for (58:23 - 58:26)
them and they're gonna be like alright (58:24 - 58:28)
here's like it's like The Children's (58:26 - 58:32)
Tylenol for you know when you've just (58:28 - 58:35)
had too much league codeine and it's (58:32 - 58:36)
just like I need to step away and get my (58:35 - 58:38)
children's Tylenol and then you play (58:36 - 58:40)
pokemon unite for a little while even if (58:38 - 58:44)
this is a failure in the West does it (58:40 - 58:45)
mean that's a failure (58:44 - 58:46)
for the Pokemon company because it could (58:45 - 58:48)
still be very very popular in China or (58:46 - 58:51)
Korea or Japan or Australia or I don't (58:48 - 58:53)
know maybe the UK players are over the (58:51 - 58:56)
moon for this I guess we just don't know (58:53 - 58:58)
but I thought they'd not so it was fine (58:56 - 59:00)
I thought the game looked cool I hope (58:58 - 59:01)
that it's good (59:00 - 59:03)
I hope the free to start isn't (59:01 - 59:06)
completely garbage I still think Pokemon (59:03 - 59:08)
masters is a little too expensive I (59:06 - 59:12)
think that Pokemon go is pretty (59:08 - 59:13)
reasonable (59:12 - 59:15)
I thought Magikarp jump was good (59:13 - 59:18)
money-wise I thought Pokemon Quest was (59:15 - 59:20)
really good out of the all of the you (59:18 - 59:23)
know quote-unquote free to start I think (59:20 - 59:25)
Pokemon quest did it perfectly it was (59:23 - 59:28)
like here's spend $25 you got everything (59:25 - 59:30)
now but you don't you don't have to (59:28 - 59:34)
spend $20 you could you could just do it (59:30 - 59:37)
I think Animal Crossing is too expensive (59:34 - 59:41)
the mobile one I thought oh yeah yep I (59:37 - 59:44)
think pocket camps a complete ripoff if (59:41 - 59:47)
it's anything like MOBAs you should just (59:44 - 59:51)
be buying hats or skins or clothes yeah (59:47 - 59:54)
it's probably a guy in the shiny yeah (59:51 - 59:56)
yeah bad Chinese at this point in time (59:54 - 60:00)
Pokemon is only flex so that doesn't (59:56 - 60:00)
that was it when we come back we're (60:01 - 60:07)
going to talk about story stuff in DLC (60:04 - 60:09)
so if you if you don't want to hear that (60:07 - 60:13)

times will all be there if you don't (60:18 - 60:20)

[Music] (60:33 - 60:41)
[Applause] (60:39 - 61:00)
[Music] (60:41 - 61:00)
we are back sword and shield dlc story (61:01 - 61:11)
talk alright five seconds here we go hop (61:07 - 61:13)
shows up story over yep (61:11 - 61:18)
thanks for the spoiler we warned you you (61:13 - 61:22)
could have skipped being in this segment (61:18 - 61:25)
really really we would have just texted (61:22 - 61:27)
you hey come back wait how far are you (61:25 - 61:29)
in the story we'll let me preface by (61:27 - 61:33)
saying I am enjoying the aisle of armor (61:29 - 61:37)
probably a hundred and fifty three times (61:33 - 61:39)
more than I liked all of sword and (61:37 - 61:43)
shield and in reflecting and wondering (61:39 - 61:44)
why that might be I think I've come to (61:43 - 61:46)
the realization that the fact that all (61:44 - 61:49)
of the Pokemon hunting you do in the (61:46 - 61:51)
aisle of armor is the same and there are (61:49 - 61:53)
no routes that are separated from the (61:51 - 61:55)
wild area and it's all wilder I love it (61:53 - 61:57)
I'm having a great time interesting (61:55 - 62:00)
still some of the same issues of like (61:57 - 62:01)
how the Pokedex tells you which ones to (62:00 - 62:05)
get and whatever that's but I'm good (62:01 - 62:08)
friends with my buddy Kapoor he hops up (62:05 - 62:10)
and down every time we have battles and (62:08 - 62:13)
he's real excited and just like yeah all (62:10 - 62:13)
that good stuff (62:13 - 62:15)
gave him a shell bail you know how to do (62:13 - 62:19)
and they said well pick a tower and I (62:15 - 62:22)
walked up to one of the towers and they (62:19 - 62:25)
were like well if you do this tower blah (62:22 - 62:28)
blah blah you can only do one you can't (62:25 - 62:31)
blah blah and then I was like well you (62:28 - 62:32)
know I'm gonna do the dark tower cuz it (62:31 - 62:34)
reminds me of that 80's game that I used (62:32 - 62:35)
to board game that I used to love to (62:34 - 62:38)
play then she's like after I've listened (62:35 - 62:40)
to her speech and everything she says (62:38 - 62:43)
make sure your cub foo is level 70 or (62:40 - 62:45)
you're not gonna have a good time and I (62:43 - 62:48)
was like me and my cub who are besties (62:45 - 62:51)
and he's only level 51 so I turned away (62:48 - 62:56)
and also ii uh it's not a preface any (62:51 - 62:58)
longer interjection and note to footnote (62:56 - 63:01)
whatever you want to call it i do not (62:58 - 63:06)
use those candies that the the pseudo (63:01 - 63:07)
rare candies i've never even used rare (63:06 - 63:09)
candies when rare candies were a thing i (63:07 - 63:13)
level up my pokemon the natural way no i (63:09 - 63:14)
say okay (63:13 - 63:16)
on battles you don't lovely yourself up (63:14 - 63:17)
the natural way but you have to do it (63:16 - 63:20)
for Pokemon I'd what what are you (63:17 - 63:23)
talking about we know about your secret (63:20 - 63:28)
steroid use I am a natural lifter sir (63:23 - 63:31)
no matter what my Instagram haters might (63:28 - 63:35)
say oh we got the real scoop we got the (63:31 - 63:38)
real scoop I got the cup foo I got it's (63:35 - 63:41)
a max friendship and then somebody in my (63:38 - 63:42)
stream was like well it's gonna take you (63:41 - 63:44)
a couple hours through the tower (63:42 - 63:46)
I said couple hours capital out words I (63:44 - 63:49)
hope I get levels with five bosses right (63:46 - 63:53)
yeah I open up my inventory I go to my (63:49 - 63:57)
900 min max l Excel candies I get Cub (63:53 - 64:00)
food in 93 in about 4 seconds (63:57 - 64:02)
no not gonna do it and as I did that to (64:00 - 64:05)
my Center scorch and I still hell hate (64:02 - 64:06)
myself for it (64:05 - 64:07)
and I said couple hours we're ready to (64:06 - 64:12)
go right now yep I love it boost it up (64:07 - 64:14)
why wait cuz I'm not a game gobbler (64:12 - 64:17)
that's why that's right all right Greg (64:14 - 64:19)
yes give me the thoughts of the story (64:17 - 64:21)
you're the story guy I am the story guy (64:19 - 64:25)
the story is boring boring yeah it's (64:21 - 64:32)
pretty boring know what I mean so it (64:25 - 64:34)
starts out like it starts out fairly (64:32 - 64:37)
promising like the the pseudo villain (64:34 - 64:39)
that you face there you know they're (64:37 - 64:42)
rising character the pseudo villain (64:39 - 64:45)
let's be real that whole thing is fine (64:42 - 64:48)
is just that never really varies off in (64:45 - 64:53)
any interesting tracks at all you you (64:48 - 64:56)
get this into this dojo where you're not (64:53 - 64:59)
supposed to because some poor some poor (64:56 - 65:01)
trainer is left at the train station (64:59 - 65:06)
forever while you take their spot oh he (65:01 - 65:09)
leaps yeah oh I thought that was a okay (65:06 - 65:12)
so they there's a spoiler this whole (65:09 - 65:14)
thing's a spoiler that dude comes back (65:12 - 65:16)
at the end and it's a super nice touch (65:14 - 65:19)
hmm yeah you you can miss that part so (65:16 - 65:21)
when you when you like get off the train (65:19 - 65:24)
there's like the professor professor (65:21 - 65:26)
scientists and she's like come back to (65:24 - 65:27)
me when you find all the Pokemon and (65:26 - 65:28)
then (65:27 - 65:29)
there's that just that NPC that's (65:28 - 65:30)
standing in the corner and I would (65:29 - 65:33)
assume most people just think he's an (65:30 - 65:35)
NPC and then just leave but if you talk (65:33 - 65:37)
to him he's like I'm too scared to go to (65:35 - 65:41)
the dojo and then they acknowledge it (65:37 - 65:43)
when you get there where honey is like (65:41 - 65:45)
oh that's not the name we have written (65:43 - 65:47)
down but you're here so let's just do it (65:45 - 65:49)
and then they make that guy come back at (65:47 - 65:53)
the end is like they actually did they (65:49 - 65:55)
actually that actually did something (65:53 - 66:00)
yeah the story serves one purpose which (65:55 - 66:02)
is to introduce you to all of the other (66:00 - 66:04)
competitive features and that's all the (66:02 - 66:06)
story does like it really doesn't expand (66:04 - 66:08)
the world that dearly doesn't do a whole (66:06 - 66:12)
lot for lore wise it's honey and mustard (66:08 - 66:15)
which just bothers me deeply their names (66:12 - 66:18)
or their caregivers their names like (66:15 - 66:20)
this (66:18 - 66:24)
um again look Melanie's name in Japanese (66:20 - 66:31)
is melon I mean I'm not saying that (66:24 - 66:34)
they're the bastions of creativity it (66:31 - 66:37)
that Sri does what it's supposed to do (66:34 - 66:42)
and that's fine it is a story driven by (66:37 - 66:46)
mechanics mainly and it's incredibly (66:42 - 66:50)
short it's not it's not particularly (66:46 - 66:54)
surprising that like you know who's (66:50 - 66:55)
gonna be at the top of the towers you (66:54 - 66:57)
know oh you know I don't know who's (66:55 - 67:00)
gonna be at the top of the tower yeah (66:57 - 67:02)
you do if you think about it for like (67:00 - 67:03)
half a second you know who's gonna be at (67:02 - 67:04)
the top of the tower (67:03 - 67:06)
well I guess I'm not thinking the same (67:04 - 67:12)
way it's just yeah it's fine it's just (67:06 - 67:15)
not very deep and then I had a little (67:12 - 67:19)
hope when the hop shows up for that (67:15 - 67:20)
sorry line to be a little bit more (67:19 - 67:23)
interesting and it just again it's just (67:20 - 67:26)
to serve the main purpose to get you to (67:23 - 67:28)
understand these mechanics that they're (67:26 - 67:30)
introducing you in the game which is a (67:28 - 67:33)
good way to introduce and get you to (67:30 - 67:35)
know the mechanics it's a good way of (67:33 - 67:38)
showing you yeah everything the game has (67:35 - 67:41)
to offer instead of being like what they (67:38 - 67:43)
did with Festival brazo was like here (67:41 - 67:45)
you go good luck figuring it out (67:43 - 67:48)
but it doesn't make a good story I I (67:45 - 67:50)
definitely agree that the story short (67:48 - 67:52)
but not unexpected like I I assumed that (67:50 - 67:55)
we were gonna get like I would probably (67:52 - 67:56)
argue that the story's like three to (67:55 - 67:59)
four hours if you get distracted yeah if (67:56 - 68:01)
you get distracted it's it's an hour (67:59 - 68:04)
tops if you don't yeah but if you don't (68:01 - 68:05)
get distracted I don't I don't know what (68:04 - 68:06)
you're really looking for in a Pokemon (68:05 - 68:08)
game I don't get how you do it like I (68:06 - 68:11)
honestly don't get how you'd not be (68:08 - 68:13)
distracted by the while there if I the (68:11 - 68:15)
Pokemon by exploring like they do the (68:13 - 68:17)
thing that people ask for we talked (68:15 - 68:20)
about this last week of just instead of (68:17 - 68:22)
crossing that Diglett bridge you can (68:20 - 68:24)
just go out to that giant whale or you (68:22 - 68:26)
can go out to these islands you can you (68:24 - 68:29)
can start doing raids you can find the (68:26 - 68:31)
hidden cave off the water and then all (68:29 - 68:32)
of a sudden you're in a cave and you're (68:31 - 68:33)
like behind (68:32 - 68:35)
you can find that yeah you can avoid it (68:33 - 68:38)
all and explore so distractions to the (68:35 - 68:41)
storyline don't enhance the storyline (68:38 - 68:43)
distractions say yes it you can easily (68:41 - 68:46)
spend a lot of time in aisle of armor (68:43 - 68:47)
that's not the issue (68:46 - 68:50)
I love armor as a DLC is good there are (68:47 - 68:53)
a lot of things to do the storyline is (68:50 - 68:57)
short and shallow if you only focus on (68:53 - 68:59)
the story if like I'm gonna knock out (68:57 - 69:01)
this story you are there for maybe an (68:59 - 69:05)
hour tops yeah that's that's it's it's (69:01 - 69:06)
it's not to say it's not saying that (69:05 - 69:08)
there's a lot of great things to do in (69:06 - 69:10)
aisle of armor because there are it's (69:08 - 69:14)
just to say the story is not it's not (69:10 - 69:17)
surprising it's not fantastic it is a (69:14 - 69:19)
mechanics driven story and that takes (69:17 - 69:22)
away from what could have been there I (69:19 - 69:25)
do think there will be much more story (69:22 - 69:27)
in the next expansion which is a lot (69:25 - 69:30)
more about exploring and this was very (69:27 - 69:32)
different I hope that story is better (69:30 - 69:33)
this one it's fine (69:32 - 69:37)
it's not it is not a revelation it is (69:33 - 69:42)
not particularly interesting I liked it (69:37 - 69:45)
or I liked to the length I liked that it (69:42 - 69:48)
was kind of short war wise which is not (69:45 - 69:51)
story wise I think like the trainer (69:48 - 69:54)
cards for mustard and honey and you know (69:51 - 69:56)
honey will even offer to battle you and (69:54 - 69:58)
stuff I think that's done really well (69:56 - 70:01)
yeah um and I think all the lore of the (69:58 - 70:04)
characters you know opal and Melanie and (70:01 - 70:06)
Gordie and B and Alastair Alec I think (70:04 - 70:08)
though they they put so much thought (70:06 - 70:09)
into these characters they just don't (70:08 - 70:11)
give them spots to shine (70:09 - 70:12)
they're like right here's your battle (70:11 - 70:15)
with them you're done the primary (70:12 - 70:18)
problem with the story of how sword and (70:15 - 70:20)
shield is presented is that to find the (70:18 - 70:23)
interesting bits you have to go find (70:20 - 70:26)
them they aren't they aren't provided to (70:23 - 70:29)
you as part of your ongoing story and (70:26 - 70:32)
that's it's it's an interesting choice (70:29 - 70:33)
there's a lot of story and lore to be (70:32 - 70:39)
had I I prefer it when you are shown (70:33 - 70:42)
those things in the world as part of the (70:39 - 70:44)
story and not like an aftereffect when I (70:42 - 70:47)
look at so-and-so's card and I realize (70:44 - 70:49)
all of these cool things that I really (70:47 - 70:52)
wish I would have seen in the story (70:49 - 70:53)
itself yeah exactly (70:52 - 70:56)
it's like show me don't tell me this is (70:53 - 70:59)
mechanics but I think the dude I guess (70:56 - 71:02)
the word is like fetch quests yeah do (70:59 - 71:04)
these fetch quests I think is better (71:02 - 71:07)
than battle these four trainers to move (71:04 - 71:09)
on to the next part of this story I (71:07 - 71:12)
don't think they were perfect no and (71:09 - 71:15)
they mixed both right like you it was (71:12 - 71:16)
definitely flipped between do these (71:15 - 71:19)
fetch quests then do these battles then (71:16 - 71:21)
do these fetch quests that do these (71:19 - 71:24)
battles like it flips between them and I (71:21 - 71:26)
think I want that more in Pokemon games (71:24 - 71:28)
of oh I guess you know we had that like (71:26 - 71:31)
when you first play like gold and silver (71:28 - 71:34)
they're like deliver this egg yeah so (71:31 - 71:35)
it's not like this is the first time (71:34 - 71:36)
they've done that kind of stuff (71:35 - 71:38)
yeah didn't they drop it halfway good (71:36 - 71:40)
then it's there's all battles but I (71:38 - 71:42)
think so it was it was definitely fun (71:40 - 71:43)
and delightful to see a bunch of (71:42 - 71:47)
slowpoke zooming around yeah that was (71:43 - 71:50)
cute they do some cute moments like (71:47 - 71:52)
there are some fun moments sure and I (71:50 - 71:54)
think they give cub few enough time to (71:52 - 71:57)
shine yeah and I think it just proves (71:54 - 72:00)
that if the Pokemon company takes time (71:57 - 72:02)
to focus on a pokemon people end up (72:00 - 72:05)
liking that Pokemon more yeah I mean (72:02 - 72:07)
there are some downsides like it's (72:05 - 72:09)
basically the island of triplets (72:07 - 72:11)
everybody in the dojo looks exactly (72:09 - 72:15)
right yeah you know there's a lot of (72:11 - 72:18)
like there's a lot of those things that (72:15 - 72:21)
make like the dojo feel a little more (72:18 - 72:23)
shallow then they could be like if they (72:21 - 72:25)
had just taken some of the models that (72:23 - 72:28)
they had used elsewhere in the game and (72:25 - 72:29)
just put them in dojo clothes like if (72:28 - 72:32)
they weren't all these fit people if (72:29 - 72:34)
there were some you know older people (72:32 - 72:35)
who were hanging around if they'd just (72:34 - 72:37)
taken other models and put them in this (72:35 - 72:40)
clothing and dumped him in there dojo (72:37 - 72:43)
would have felt more full and allied (72:40 - 72:46)
other models they have 40 hairs just (72:43 - 72:48)
change up a hair now they all had to (72:46 - 72:52)
wear at the man bun yeah I mean you're (72:48 - 72:55)
complaining about models I literally (72:52 - 72:58)
live in Stowe on side and do you buy (72:55 - 73:00)
something (72:58 - 73:02)
standing next to him who sells you (73:00 - 73:04)
something are exactly the things I (73:02 - 73:06)
believe they're brothers though to be (73:04 - 73:09)
fair they lie you're twins twins are (73:06 - 73:10)
popular in the Pokemon world sure know (73:09 - 73:11)
this that's true (73:10 - 73:14)
okay the other part of the DLC when you (73:11 - 73:16)
do fight mustard at the top of the tower (73:14 - 73:20)
spoiler and he like rips off his like (73:16 - 73:27)
Rambo hoodie and I think that I think (73:20 - 73:29)
the problem and maybe this is maybe this (73:27 - 73:31)
is what you haven't said yet Greg but (73:29 - 73:35)
you but your thinking is that mustard is (73:31 - 73:36)
such a good character they don't give (73:35 - 73:38)
him enough time and they easily could (73:36 - 73:42)
have easily like he's such a good (73:38 - 73:44)
character he is a great character that (73:42 - 73:46)
they just don't do enough with I do (73:44 - 73:48)
really enjoy that every time he sends (73:46 - 73:52)
you out for a mission and uh and like (73:48 - 73:53)
you're in the middle of doing it but you (73:52 - 73:55)
haven't finished it yet he's playing (73:53 - 73:57)
switch what yes he is he's playing (73:55 - 74:02)
Pokemon quest yeah he yells at you yeah (73:57 - 74:05)
I've done that several times like (74:02 - 74:08)
mustard has a ton of great personality (74:05 - 74:11)
and well honey and mustard both do they (74:08 - 74:14)
just there's just not enough story to (74:11 - 74:16)
let them really shine yeah I think (74:14 - 74:17)
that's a good complaint I don't know (74:16 - 74:20)
yeah I don't know if the islands like (74:17 - 74:23)
big enough to give them to give you more (74:20 - 74:27)
story though like what else I think the (74:23 - 74:28)
thing I worry about and I think why I (74:27 - 74:31)
liked this story better is because I go (74:28 - 74:32)
back and I think of Orin as his Delta (74:31 - 74:35)
episode which I felt like was twice as (74:32 - 74:38)
long as this and I hated every minute of (74:35 - 74:40)
it because it was like fly here talk to (74:38 - 74:41)
this person (74:40 - 74:43)
why here talk to this person and I was (74:41 - 74:45)
like I don't want to do that I don't (74:43 - 74:47)
want to feel like exactly what happened (74:45 - 74:49)
this what happened in this one - it's (74:47 - 74:51)
just all contained in one island and the (74:49 - 74:53)
entire know why the exact the only (74:51 - 74:55)
difference is that this is the only (74:53 - 74:57)
difference is that this is entirely a (74:55 - 75:00)
new Island is the exact same quest is (74:57 - 75:01)
the exact same quest of the Delta (75:00 - 75:04)
episode but you in the Delta episodes (75:01 - 75:05)
you are visiting places you had already (75:04 - 75:07)
seen which is not the case for this one (75:05 - 75:10)
which makes it new and exciting it's the (75:07 - 75:11)
same story look I'm not saying I'm (75:10 - 75:13)
easily tricked I'm just (75:11 - 75:16)
just I'm just like the delta episode was (75:13 - 75:18)
too long and didn't have variety and (75:16 - 75:20)
there was variety between knocking out (75:18 - 75:23)
slowpoke climbing a tower finding (75:20 - 75:26)
mushrooms and doing that vespiquen raid (75:23 - 75:29)
was you have you have the wildest (75:26 - 75:31)
remembrance you like to ignore a lot of (75:29 - 75:33)
what happened in the Delta episode oh (75:31 - 75:35)
man okay you climb a tower at the end of (75:33 - 75:36)
the Delta episode but that's also not (75:35 - 75:38)
great either it's a lot of talking to (75:36 - 75:41)
not stephen stohn that his dad I don't (75:38 - 75:45)
remember his dad or his nephew whoever's (75:41 - 75:49)
the dude in the the stone museum or (75:45 - 75:50)
whatever you got to talk to that guy (75:49 - 75:54)
like 40 times but for me it was it was (75:50 - 75:57)
like talking to that dude in the (75:54 - 76:00)
beginning having honey acknowledge it (75:57 - 76:02)
having that dude showed up put a smile (76:00 - 76:05)
on my face cuz they they they actually (76:02 - 76:08)
did the thing of acknowledging the the (76:05 - 76:10)
silly dialogue they put into games and (76:08 - 76:12)
they did the thing where they (76:10 - 76:15)
acknowledge Leon's lostness finally (76:12 - 76:19)
where mustard tells you that like you're (76:15 - 76:22)
one of the few first students in like (76:19 - 76:24)
several years that I've ever gotten this (76:22 - 76:28)
far and the reason that Leon who was (76:24 - 76:31)
like his greatest disciple or whatever (76:28 - 76:33)
doesn't have a cup foo is cuz he (76:31 - 76:35)
couldn't figure out which tower to go to (76:33 - 76:37)
like he got lost getting to the towers (76:35 - 76:39)
and I was like this is oh wait then he (76:37 - 76:41)
should have a cup for ya he just doesn't (76:39 - 76:44)
have an ear she yeah yeah probably so (76:41 - 76:46)
like them acknowledging that was like (76:44 - 76:49)
finally they like use this lostness (76:46 - 76:51)
thing yeah (76:49 - 76:56)
cleverly cleverly yeah yeah whereas it (76:51 - 76:57)
didn't really make sense in the like him (76:56 - 77:00)
getting lost like he didn't get lost to (76:57 - 77:02)
save the world he didn't get lost to (77:00 - 77:04)
like show up for a stadium match but (77:02 - 77:05)
because he got lost and couldn't find a (77:04 - 77:08)
tower was like cool you acknowledged it (77:05 - 77:11)
that's yeah that's awesome they do cute (77:08 - 77:14)
touches there are cute touches (77:11 - 77:16)
throughout the very short Channel story (77:14 - 77:17)
the music was really great especially (77:16 - 77:20)
for mustard you played with the music on (77:17 - 77:24)
oh yeah you got to oh yeah mustard I (77:20 - 77:27)
mean mustard songs a banger I mean (77:24 - 77:27)
secret (77:27 - 77:29)
the reason about he enjoys these things (77:27 - 77:31)
more is because he has an audience and (77:29 - 77:34)
he's not playing them alone ah look at (77:31 - 77:41)
was about polka music I I mean like I (77:34 - 77:43)
guess the answer is like what how do you (77:41 - 77:46)
want them to make it longer without (77:43 - 77:49)
adding pointless battles which is which (77:46 - 77:50)
it was the worry it was the word going (77:49 - 77:52)
into the dlc what are the how they gonna (77:50 - 77:54)
do this I'm not asking for more battles (77:52 - 77:56)
I'm asking for more exploration as to (77:54 - 77:58)
what the Isle of armor is let's talk (77:56 - 78:01)
about why all these wildly varying (77:58 - 78:03)
biomes are here let's talk about (78:01 - 78:05)
exploring the history of why the towers (78:03 - 78:07)
are there let's explore like I don't (78:05 - 78:10)
need more battles I need more lore and (78:07 - 78:12)
more story I mean yeah why is your (78:10 - 78:14)
valuable dress so weird like I can't (78:12 - 78:16)
like if you want me to sit down and (78:14 - 78:18)
creatively write an additional story (78:16 - 78:21)
give me a couple of weeks tonight I will (78:18 - 78:22)
I can write a ton of stories that happen (78:21 - 78:24)
I don't know what I communicate that (78:22 - 78:26)
though because we saw that they did this (78:24 - 78:27)
in Sun and Moon where they added these (78:26 - 78:30)
cut scenes and people were like ah okay (78:27 - 78:34)
cut scenes too long the game is 90% cut (78:30 - 78:36)
scenes well that's because they stacked (78:34 - 78:39)
all the cut scenes up front if you're (78:36 - 78:42)
gonna go off of one people's complaints (78:39 - 78:43)
then you're gonna have to say well then (78:42 - 78:44)
they shouldn't do this our national debt (78:43 - 78:47)
I just saying how would you do it you (78:44 - 78:49)
can say I want to write more lower and I (78:47 - 78:51)
want more story but how do you want them (78:49 - 78:52)
to put that into the game that's what (78:51 - 78:55)
I'm asking do you want like characters (78:52 - 78:57)
standing outside the tower giving you (78:55 - 78:59)
lore do you want mustard - yeah thank (78:57 - 79:01)
you more than they should do it like (78:59 - 79:03)
destiny you pick up little pieces of cry (79:01 - 79:07)
no one wants to do that cried I mean I'd (79:03 - 79:08)
rather do that than find a hundred and (79:07 - 79:12)
fifty Diglett two million Ling's like (79:08 - 79:14)
they could easily for postgame stuff (79:12 - 79:16)
have trainers from other regions come (79:14 - 79:19)
and say hey take me to this area I've (79:16 - 79:20)
never seen this I'm trying to catch this (79:19 - 79:22)
you know there's a ton of ways that they (79:20 - 79:24)
could bring other characters from the (79:22 - 79:26)
entire Pokemon universe to this that you (79:24 - 79:28)
would interact it on a daily basis or (79:26 - 79:30)
musters you could say hey we're getting (79:28 - 79:32)
a bunch of new arrivals who are coming (79:30 - 79:33)
today we're getting a new class can you (79:32 - 79:34)
go pick them up at the train station (79:33 - 79:36)
have a little bit's about that and they (79:34 - 79:38)
can talk more about a bunch of like (79:36 - 79:41)
there's a million ways you can do that (79:38 - 79:44)
like it's not it like the sky's the (79:41 - 79:46)
limit they can do whatever they wish (79:44 - 79:48)
what do I want I would love to have (79:46 - 79:50)
daily visitors I would love to have (79:48 - 79:53)
people from really visitors though that (79:50 - 79:55)
are off from the region yeah yeah yeah (79:53 - 79:57)
but they say listen theists show up or I (79:55 - 80:00)
would like to see a Wallace and Steven (79:57 - 80:02)
stone vacationing in Galler for a while (80:00 - 80:03)
and going on their second honeymoon like (80:02 - 80:06)
all of these things they could do to (80:03 - 80:08)
extend the story to give more to the (80:06 - 80:10)
story thanks like a million things they (80:08 - 80:13)
can do like if the story continued after (80:10 - 80:15)
posting like making postgame story (80:13 - 80:19)
optional is perfectly fine by me like if (80:15 - 80:22)
it was one hour but I can choose to go (80:19 - 80:24)
talk to these people to do more things (80:22 - 80:27)
to learn more about this region I would (80:24 - 80:29)
love that so what I'm hearing is you (80:27 - 80:35)
hate it then you need to real isn't it (80:29 - 80:37)
yeah no I think I think I think those (80:35 - 80:39)
are good complaints I didn't think they (80:37 - 80:41)
were gonna do it right this time (80:39 - 80:43)
and I think they got I think they got (80:41 - 80:45)
that didn't I don't think they did it (80:43 - 80:48)
wrong I stand by it's a solid B it's a (80:45 - 80:52)
solid B great you know really good way (80:48 - 80:54)
better than average I give it a fourth (80:52 - 81:00)
grade a junior year B so the part we (80:54 - 81:02)
talked about last week if you don't (81:00 - 81:04)
finish the postgame then hop doesn't (81:02 - 81:07)
show up so when you beat mustard at the (81:04 - 81:09)
top of whatever tower you choose and you (81:07 - 81:12)
go back to the dojo hop is there he's (81:09 - 81:14)
there to be his professor or to help (81:12 - 81:18)
Sonja they hint that Sonja's in a snowy (81:14 - 81:19)
area I don't know if people caught that (81:18 - 81:23)
hint yeah so she'll obviously come back (81:19 - 81:26)
for the crown Tundra unless she doesn't (81:23 - 81:28)
survive yeah that's true by the time we (81:26 - 81:29)
get there she could be frozen solid yep (81:28 - 81:32)
and so hop wants you (81:29 - 81:34)
I think the hop stuff is mostly to (81:32 - 81:36)
Giganta max you're a chief ooh yeah (81:34 - 81:39)
teach you about the soup and mustard and (81:36 - 81:42)
confirmed if you have not done all the (81:39 - 81:44)
way to (81:42 - 81:46)
hot decide hop decides to do that what (81:44 - 81:50)
after you do the battle to catch one of (81:46 - 81:52)
the wolves right or you battle him again (81:50 - 81:54)
you have to do the whole sword bird and (81:52 - 81:56)
shield Bert story yeah which is after (81:54 - 81:58)
that because I know people who people (81:56 - 82:00)
are asking me on Twitter what do I have (81:58 - 82:01)
to finish I'm like you have to finish (82:00 - 82:04)
that whole that whole and you pretty (82:01 - 82:06)
much have to fit if there's a flag on (82:04 - 82:07)
your map you have to finish all the (82:06 - 82:10)
flags is what it is that flight was (82:07 - 82:15)
bothering me for however many many (82:10 - 82:17)
months or weeks yeah you need to get to (82:15 - 82:20)
the part at the very end when he decides (82:17 - 82:22)
he's going to be a professor because (82:20 - 82:24)
that's what he really wants to do the (82:22 - 82:29)
vespiquen match yes was awesome it was (82:24 - 82:31)
everything I haven't come across that (82:29 - 82:35)
yet it's a it's a very it's a very big (82:31 - 82:37)
surprise what happens that I was not (82:35 - 82:38)
sure what the mechanics were when I got (82:37 - 82:41)
in there it's kind of like you ever play (82:38 - 82:42)
when you played red and blue for the (82:41 - 82:44)
first time then you get to cerulean city (82:42 - 82:47)
and you're like I just want to explore (82:44 - 82:50)
the town real quick and you like walk up (82:47 - 82:52)
a little bit and then your rival shows (82:50 - 82:55)
up and he's like oh we're battling and (82:52 - 82:59)
you're like no I just walked into the (82:55 - 83:03)
town that's what the vespiquen part (82:59 - 83:06)
reminded me of and it's not like I lost (83:03 - 83:07)
it the first time because I literally (83:06 - 83:12)
had one cub fool but you know if you had (83:07 - 83:14)
like a talonflame or something it's (83:12 - 83:16)
relatively easy and I always when people (83:14 - 83:18)
are always like I want Pokemon games be (83:16 - 83:19)
hard I feel like people remember that (83:18 - 83:21)
moment or like the moment where you get (83:19 - 83:23)
to the end of the SSN and you're like I (83:21 - 83:24)
just want to see what's down this (83:23 - 83:26)
hallway and then your rival pops up and (83:24 - 83:28)
it's not it's not because it's hard it's (83:26 - 83:30)
just there are these unexpected (83:28 - 83:32)
instances where you're not prepared and (83:30 - 83:34)
that's what actually like screws you (83:32 - 83:36)
over and not specifically because like (83:34 - 83:38)
you suddenly forgot how to battle it's (83:36 - 83:40)
just like oh I just wanted to see what's (83:38 - 83:40)
down this hallway (83:40 - 83:43)
and now I'm stuck in this battle and all (83:40 - 83:46)
I got is a level 30 red and sad that's (83:43 - 83:49)
yeah half health and I lose we cuz of (83:46 - 83:51)
that I will say that you know I actually (83:49 - 83:52)
know that I'm thinking back to where I (83:51 - 83:54)
am in the game that that what was super (83:52 - 83:56)
frustrating for me was I walked up to (83:54 - 83:57)
the town (83:56 - 84:01)
and the woman said you can only have cup (83:57 - 84:05)
foo in your party and so I took all the (84:01 - 84:07)
Pokemon out of my party and saved and is (84:05 - 84:10)
like okay I'm ready and then I walked up (84:07 - 84:11)
again and she's like and make sure cup (84:10 - 84:15)
foo is level seven she said that first I (84:11 - 84:18)
would have walked away and taking care (84:15 - 84:20)
of things and not spent all that time (84:18 - 84:22)
getting all the pokemons out of my party (84:20 - 84:25)
the game does though it's smart enough (84:22 - 84:27)
to know that you couldn't ever stone on (84:25 - 84:30)
the cup foo so when I finished mustard (84:27 - 84:31)
and he's like go evolve your cup food (84:30 - 84:34)
now and then I like touch it he goes oh (84:31 - 84:36)
I see you have a never stone on your cup (84:34 - 84:38)
foo I guess you want to spend more time (84:36 - 84:40)
with Cub Foods so that's fine feel free (84:38 - 84:41)
to leave come back when you're ready (84:40 - 84:43)
it was a really nice touch that they (84:41 - 84:46)
like engaged but you couldn't go back (84:43 - 84:49)
and do the other tower still right no no (84:46 - 84:51)
no no I know that choice is made it's (84:49 - 84:54)
made yeah I know they opened up there's (84:51 - 84:56)
like sparring or something that opens up (84:54 - 84:58)
when you're done done but I don't know (84:56 - 85:00)
what that is this restrictive battling (84:58 - 85:04)
yeah which is like behind the dojo not (85:00 - 85:08)
in the tower yeah I really thought they (85:04 - 85:09)
were gonna use the towers for something (85:08 - 85:12)
else but I guess they didn't yeah no no (85:09 - 85:16)
restrictive sparring not battling same (85:12 - 85:19)
thing yeah I thought I thought they (85:16 - 85:21)
would you know once you've finished the (85:19 - 85:22)
towers they were gonna use them for like (85:21 - 85:25)
some battle tower thing where you gotta (85:22 - 85:28)
go up with one Pokemon or something and (85:25 - 85:30)
that was a little bit of a letdown yeah (85:28 - 85:32)
I'm gonna try restrictive sparring at (85:30 - 85:35)
one point I just just have to figure out (85:32 - 85:37)
what type I wanna try first (85:35 - 85:42)
berry maybe alright let's get through (85:37 - 85:43)
this news real quick Pokemon masters (85:42 - 85:47)
full disclosure I'm partnered with DNA (85:43 - 85:51)
they added eggs to the game this is off (85:47 - 85:54)
their website you can receive eggs from (85:51 - 85:56)
Professor Bellis when completing areas (85:54 - 85:58)
of the main story or training areas that (85:56 - 86:01)
have featured battles Pokemon you can (85:58 - 86:03)
hatch have eggs have different roles and (86:01 - 86:05)
passive skills than other Pokemon on the (86:03 - 86:07)
same species so currently right now you (86:05 - 86:11)
can hash Poros female Meowth be (86:07 - 86:15)
Bellsprout female knitter an male Zubat (86:11 - 86:17)
and male Rattata (86:15 - 86:19)
they said other genders will appear in (86:17 - 86:23)
future eggs and tauros is allowed to be (86:19 - 86:28)
shiny edits new items you can buy so you (86:23 - 86:30)
you get a default egg box and you get a (86:28 - 86:31)
default incubator (86:30 - 86:35)
this may sound familiar from oh come on (86:31 - 86:37)
go and then there's a daycare so when (86:35 - 86:39)
you hatch an egg it will go to the (86:37 - 86:41)
daycare and then in the daycare you can (86:39 - 86:42)
select it to be your partner Pokemon (86:41 - 86:46)
there's also an egg research ticket the (86:42 - 86:50)
which will let you like auto hatch stuff (86:46 - 86:53)
but I don't know Greg if you've done any (86:50 - 86:55)
of the eggs I have done none of the eggs (86:53 - 86:58)
I have looked at the egg update but I (86:55 - 87:01)
haven't like (86:58 - 87:01)
here's my problem none none of the (87:02 - 87:08)
pokemon that are currently hatch Abul (87:05 - 87:11)
from the eggs excite me in any way so (87:08 - 87:15)
I'm like oh okay I'll get to it yeah so (87:11 - 87:19)
there's no walking like Pokemon go and (87:15 - 87:22)
they're there they do a thing where this (87:19 - 87:24)
this is kind of a complaint we've had (87:22 - 87:26)
the the real money verse the the gems or (87:24 - 87:29)
the real the money gems versus the free (87:26 - 87:31)
gems I guess which I just wish there was (87:29 - 87:33)
two different currencies I wish (87:31 - 87:36)
absolutely I just wish one was like gems (87:33 - 87:37)
and one was diamonds or something I (87:36 - 87:40)
don't know just I don't like the little (87:37 - 87:43)
tiny text that says like the paid you (87:40 - 87:47)
can so you can only do egg stuff with (87:43 - 87:50)
real money you can so your egg box can (87:47 - 87:52)
hold four eggs think of this like in (87:50 - 87:54)
Pokemon go where you can hold nine you (87:52 - 87:57)
can spend a hundred and eighty gems (87:54 - 88:00)
which is what like two bucks to expand (87:57 - 88:03)
it to hold eight (88:00 - 88:05)
and then you get one free incubator just (88:03 - 88:11)
like in Pokemon go and you can expiry (88:05 - 88:14)
the incubator is permanent though unlike (88:11 - 88:17)
Pokemon go to dollar incubator in (88:14 - 88:18)
Pokemon go I think last three times and (88:17 - 88:20)
then a bricks this incubator is (88:18 - 88:23)
permanent but you can only buy the egg (88:20 - 88:26)
upgrade box and the incubator with paid (88:23 - 88:29)
gems and this is what got me to actually (88:26 - 88:33)
spend money and this game cool but I am (88:29 - 88:35)
AI am always a sucker for permanent (88:33 - 88:37)
things you're gonna tell me my egg a box (88:35 - 88:39)
is permanently upgraded and I'm (88:37 - 88:41)
permanently with an incubator I'm into (88:39 - 88:43)
that so I ended up spending uh ten (88:41 - 88:46)
dollars in in pokemon or Pokemon masters (88:43 - 88:48)
I have two egg incubators this is pretty (88:46 - 88:50)
much how it works there's a 20% chance (88:48 - 88:53)
when you do a battle in the story or (88:50 - 88:55)
like a training battle that an egg drops (88:53 - 88:57)
they drop into your egg box there's (88:55 - 89:00)
either one star 2 star 3 star eggs they (88:57 - 89:02)
all have the same Pokemon I listed below (89:00 - 89:06)
above or in this episode and then you (89:02 - 89:07)
can pick which egg you want to put in (89:06 - 89:09)
the incubator just like Pokemon go and (89:07 - 89:12)
then a 12-hour countdown starts and then (89:09 - 89:17)
you have to do 3 of any battle to get it (89:12 - 89:19)
to hatch so if you just wait the 12 (89:17 - 89:20)
hours it doesn't hatch you got to do 12 (89:19 - 89:24)
hours plus 3 battles and that's it and (89:20 - 89:27)
if you put 2 eggs in an incubator and (89:24 - 89:29)
you do 3 battles it'll apply to both (89:27 - 89:31)
relatively easy and simple you just (89:29 - 89:34)
gotta wait 12 hours and I've hatched so (89:31 - 89:37)
far on it I ran or a tatse a meow to (89:34 - 89:39)
tauros and a Bellsprout there's no (89:37 - 89:42)
walking there's no jumping through hoops (89:39 - 89:44)
you just get your eggs you put them in (89:42 - 89:47)
you wait 12 hours you're good to go and (89:44 - 89:49)
the last thing you can buy which I (89:47 - 89:54)
didn't is an accelerator pass and that's (89:49 - 89:58)
500 gems and it says that it adds an (89:54 - 90:00)
additional limit it all adds a (89:58 - 90:01)
limited-time incubator so this one will (90:00 - 90:05)
break it will only last 14 days when all (90:01 - 90:07)
your incubators are in use you can (90:05 - 90:08)
select up to 4 eggs from your box and it (90:07 - 90:11)
will Auto it will just Auto incubate (90:08 - 90:12)
them so you don't have to like wake you (90:11 - 90:14)
don't have to like send an alarm for 12 (90:12 - 90:16)
hours wake up put (90:14 - 90:18)
more eggs and move on so that's more of (90:16 - 90:21)
like an automated thing which we've seen (90:18 - 90:22)
in other games I think clash Royale (90:21 - 90:26)
clash Royale had that where you could (90:22 - 90:28)
manually open one chest at a time but if (90:26 - 90:30)
you bought the season pass you we would (90:28 - 90:33)
like queue up a chest for you so I did (90:30 - 90:36)
not purchase that because it was not (90:33 - 90:38)
permanent I have had a couple people say (90:36 - 90:41)
they fell off masters the egg stuff (90:38 - 90:43)
brought them back they thought the egg (90:41 - 90:46)
stuff was fun and doesn't seem very (90:43 - 90:48)
money grabby I mean they can't take any (90:46 - 90:51)
more of my money I gave them the $5 to (90:48 - 90:54)
get the first incubator and the $2 to (90:51 - 90:57)
get the thing there's there's no more (90:54 - 91:00)
money for them to take from me so a (90:57 - 91:03)
place that now you oh yeah (91:00 - 91:04)
I'm sure they'll sell more if they sell (91:03 - 91:06)
more permanent incubators I'd probably (91:04 - 91:08)
buy them but I don't know what the plan (91:06 - 91:10)
is in the future like they have what six (91:08 - 91:12)
Pokemon in incubators right now or in (91:10 - 91:14)
eggs right now do they add more to that (91:12 - 91:15)
do they (91:14 - 91:19)
just swap out all six I think it would (91:15 - 91:20)
probably be more exciting if they swap (91:19 - 91:21)
out all six I would rather have a (91:20 - 91:24)
smaller pool knowing what I'm getting (91:21 - 91:27)
and then the other thing is data miners (91:24 - 91:29)
determined that the chance for shiny (91:27 - 91:34)
tauros is 1% give or take like one point (91:29 - 91:36)
one seven or point nine seven because I (91:34 - 91:37)
think it's like point nine seven in one (91:36 - 91:39)
star and then it's at one point one (91:37 - 91:42)
seven and three star so one had a (91:39 - 91:43)
hundred chance for a shiny pokemon I (91:42 - 91:46)
don't think it's awful I mean even (91:43 - 91:48)
that's not bad at all bad (91:46 - 91:49)
even if you don't pay any money you can (91:48 - 91:52)
do two eggs a day that I don't think (91:49 - 91:54)
that's bad I think it's pretty good have (91:52 - 91:56)
you played with any of the eggs eh like (91:54 - 91:58)
how is the partnering system do your (91:56 - 92:01)
moves changed your moves change with the (91:58 - 92:04)
Pokemon like are there different skills (92:01 - 92:08)
to buy with Taurus than with yes so one (92:04 - 92:10)
of my tauros is no blizzard and then (92:08 - 92:13)
another Toro snows like Thunderbolts so (92:10 - 92:14)
they do hatch with different moves and (92:13 - 92:17)
different abilities and I've the shiny (92:14 - 92:21)
one is locked to a like really good move (92:17 - 92:25)
set what I've been told so the one (92:21 - 92:27)
Taurus I have is a support and then the (92:25 - 92:29)
other Taurus I have is the what's (92:27 - 92:31)
exclamation mark Lakes strike not (92:29 - 92:34)
striker but like tech tackle yeah and (92:31 - 92:36)
then the shiny one can only be a striker (92:34 - 92:39)
which is the best for Taurus according (92:36 - 92:42)
to people who play the game way more (92:39 - 92:43)
than I do (92:42 - 92:47)
yeah I'm a little worried about like the (92:43 - 92:49)
more eggs that come in and the more like (92:47 - 92:52)
the mortar it you know it's still it it (92:49 - 92:55)
is still a way to feed into the grind of (92:52 - 92:56)
now that I've got this Taurus that I (92:55 - 92:58)
want that shiny now I have to go through (92:56 - 93:00)
the same grind to get all the things to (92:58 - 93:03)
level this pair up I'm also feeling a (93:00 - 93:06)
little weird about when they start (93:03 - 93:09)
doubling up with Pokemon that other sync (93:06 - 93:12)
pairs already have wait does somebody (93:09 - 93:16)
have Taurus currently no but there's (93:12 - 93:19)
going to come a point when that happens (93:16 - 93:21)
and so just thinking down the future of (93:19 - 93:23)
how that's gonna be managed or if (93:21 - 93:25)
they're just never going to you know (93:23 - 93:28)
they're only gonna live it - eggs - (93:25 - 93:31)
Pokemon that other don't have even (93:28 - 93:32)
though they've already done that with (93:31 - 93:34)
Charizard and stuff yeah I mean I would (93:32 - 93:36)
I would hope that the eggs just stick to (93:34 - 93:39)
Pokemon that may be somebody's favorite (93:36 - 93:41)
but you know a gym leader doesn't end (93:39 - 93:45)
abusing I hope so I'm just curious how (93:41 - 93:46)
it's gonna play out in the future (93:45 - 93:51)
I just also hope that this 1% doesn't (93:46 - 93:53)
get dramatically dropped to like point (93:51 - 93:56)
zero zero zero three percent as they add (93:53 - 94:00)
more Pokemon because I think one percent (93:56 - 94:03)
is is good like one percent is exciting (94:00 - 94:08)
to hatch eggs and I don't think DNA came (94:03 - 94:09)
out and said like hey these are the odds (94:08 - 94:12)
but because the data miners were like (94:09 - 94:15)
you know you have a you have a five (94:12 - 94:16)
percent chance of getting Toros one (94:15 - 94:19)
percent chance of that being shiny or (94:16 - 94:22)
like 5 plus 1 is 6 and then like 30% (94:19 - 94:25)
chance for attacks of 20% chance for (94:22 - 94:28)
like we know what they are and I like (94:25 - 94:30)
when loot boxes show that transparency (94:28 - 94:32)
and I think that's why I'm so frustrated (94:30 - 94:33)
with Pokemon go eggs and I've been (94:32 - 94:35)
frustrated with Pokemon go it's like uh (94:33 - 94:38)
well you know they said fossils are in (94:35 - 94:40)
here but I keep getting interests (94:38 - 94:43)
I've heard they're supposed to be our (94:40 - 94:46)
dactyls in these and I get it like the (94:43 - 94:48)
self road like they'll you know find a (94:46 - 94:49)
thousand people they'll calculate the (94:48 - 94:53)
odds but just just tell us just just (94:49 - 94:56)
what a mystery the mystery all right (94:53 - 94:58)
this podcast is going on too long (94:56 - 95:01)

poker button though it's a real good bug (101:23 - 101:28)

chata (101:38 - 101:42)
know I'm not quite this Pokemon one of (101:39 - 101:44)
the most forgettable Pokemon was only (101:42 - 101:46)
ever available in the world between (101:44 - 101:50)
April 16 2016 and through February 28th (101:46 - 101:54)
2017 we originally discovered it as part (101:50 - 101:57)
of a data miner leak in 2014 so we're (101:54 - 101:59)
really surprised when it finally (101:57 - 102:02)
appeared over two years later it is the (101:59 - 102:04)
last pokemon in the central Kalos (102:02 - 102:06)
pokedex even though it was distributed (102:04 - 102:08)
when the Hoenn region was the primary (102:06 - 102:11)
region and one month before we all (102:08 - 102:15)
started exploring the Lola there you go (102:11 - 102:15)
so forgettable (102:17 - 102:20)
you've already already forgotten what it (102:18 - 102:24)
is that is our show (102:20 - 102:26)
I don't know forgetting any breaking (102:24 - 102:29)
Pokemon news the next week hopefully man (102:26 - 102:31)
they handle this rollercoaster of (102:29 - 102:35)
emotion next week we have some Pokemon (102:31 - 102:38)
Go news regarding what they plan out for (102:35 - 102:41)
July the lead-up to Pokemon go fast (102:38 - 102:42)
they're doing some stuff for that we'll (102:41 - 102:44)
be talking about are I think by then all (102:42 - 102:46)
three of us will have played enough cafe (102:44 - 102:48)
mix I've only heard positive things (102:46 - 102:49)

about that next week (102:54 - 102:59)
I made an app record guide so if you're (102:56 - 103:01)
looking at how the scam o matic works (102:59 - 103:04)
that is on Twitter in it if you are (103:01 - 103:05)
curious about some of the walking (103:04 - 103:07)
animations I made a really good walking (103:05 - 103:11)
animation video on YouTube I'm working (103:07 - 103:14)
on trying to make a max mushroom guide (103:11 - 103:17)
right now on YouTube because the (103:14 - 103:19)
stereotypical answer is do three max (103:17 - 103:21)
raids and max mushrooms will appear and (103:19 - 103:25)
that's not the case and so I just want (103:21 - 103:26)
to clear up any confusion can you have (103:25 - 103:29)
more than one spawn can you keep doing (103:26 - 103:31)
raids what kind of raids count how many (103:29 - 103:32)
Ray's do you got to do where are they (103:31 - 103:35)
located so I'm gonna try to do some of (103:32 - 103:36)
that there should actually be a YouTube (103:35 - 103:39)
video of everything you can do daily and (103:36 - 103:40)
sword and shield that we'll be putting (103:39 - 103:42)
