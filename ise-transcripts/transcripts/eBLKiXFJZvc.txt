[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 400 in 15th episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SBJ with me Greg hello it is I here again I'm tired y'all I woke up from a nap you better not be tired we got a lot to talk about well I'm excited to talk about it you just need to give me a moment to rev back up I took a lovely nap beforehand so I could be back at full power to face the slings and arrows of the Pokemon fans outraged by the tragedy that happened on Wednesday the National nightmare can't in use oh dear angry Pokemon fan will also hear I ain't angry I love it I thought Greg just said his name is Pierre which is yeah odd we also strangely enough I'm wearing joggers for the first time ever who you join that sweatpants life I mean no no no no no no no no take a step back young excuse to Joey ah I've been wearing sweat pants for a long time these are joggers right joggers are incredibly uncomfortable sweatpants oh I love it are you wearing them cuz I had them and I just woke up from a nap and I was like I gotta throw something on the record this podcast shirts when you can tell we're serious when we put pants on high I always wear pants when I'm podcasting Thank You mm-hmm all right all right all right we got out we got a big show there's an announcement we're gonna talk about that there are two parts of the announcement everyone forgot the first part of the announcement and then we're gonna do that and then we're gonna take a break and then we're going to talk about the story of the sword and shield DLC so if in over two weeks we'll spend about 45 seconds on it because that's how long story is and we'll move on so if you don't want spoilers we'll give you a warning for that although I'm sure if you're listening to this podcast you probably bought the sword and shield DLC you're probably already beat the story so I'm not too worried about that but jumping right into news there was a another there was two Nintendo directs one was the one that they did the morning of the aisle of armor to announce the aisle of armor and Pokemon smile and those the other things cafe mix and cafe mix zero aura yeah probably one other thing I can't remember that was that was two weeks ago before the world turned upside her upside down right okay have you guys started playing cafe mix at all yeah I did I started haven't gotten there yet have we hit a million zeros well yeah it's part of the news but okay okay oh sorry boy without he gave me the outline before we start my gosh now people are gonna turn off the podcast or like how he hit the zero or oh yeah those are way news we needed all right so I needed to know they the the first part of the news was cafe makes is available worldwide of this past weeks 11 minute pokemon presents I think it was called so cafe makes available worldwide android switch iOS I've installed it I have not played it I have already am I the only person has played it in this round research all week about these silly max mushrooms nothing silly about it max mushroom my friend I think you know Semitic some of mushrooms they'll be the amount of misinformation in the Pokemon world is what vast and has the Pokemon world changed so much that misinformation has spread I remember when you could find a Mew under that truck yeah yeah we've we've we've long since come from the days of false rumors to less false rumors the second part of the announcement was a brand new game called poke Pokemon unite yeah I would probably say they spent about a solid 65 seconds on the cafe mix announcement and then the the arrest was for Pokemon unite so it's brand new gaya I'm gonna read the press release I have four other articles pulled up regarding because there's a lot of dissect here there is a reason to be upset about this game there is a reason to not like this game and then there's the bunch of people that are optimistic about this because it is a brand new type of Pokemon game for the first time so the announcement says Pokemon unite announced for the Nintendo switch and mobile devices it's a cross-platform game being developed in a partnership with $0.10 June 24th today the Pokemon presents video presentation Ishihara president and CEO of the pokemon company unveiled pokemon unite a brand a unites in all caps for whatever it's worth a new game made for the Nintendo switch system and mobile devices unite is being developed in a partnership with ten senses games I'm gonna say it's time I capital T lowercase I capital M lowercase I Studios activity that's Timmy yay Jimmy I would I'm gonna assume it's time i but why why would you in no language does that make sense T me would be more so I think it will t me no I think it's to me I think it's time e hi Mimi yeah hi me yeah well probably refer to it as $0.10 for word because that's one of the complaints here pokemon unite is the first strategic pokemon team battle game I detect no lies in that sentence players will face off against each other in five on five team battles during the battles players will cooperate with teammates to catch pokemon level up and evolve their own pokemon and they will need to defeat their opponents pokemon while trying to earn more points than the opposing team within an allotted time oh come on unite will be free to start and that's it that's the actual announcement then goes about the Pokemon company if you don't know Pokemon company International manages outside for Asia brand licensing marketing trading card game and made it serious Home Entertainment it was first launched in Japan 1996 more interesting here about time I or team Timmy or Harvey sayit tie me tie me is a subsidiary of 10 cent and it is a leading leading global video game development team headquarters in Shenzhen China has an office in Los Angeles Shanghai and Sheng Jue do China they strive to create high quality high fidelity and highly accessible games across a wide variety variety of genres founded in 2008 they have developed titles including honor of Kings speed drifters cross fires arena of Valor which is a MOBA game available on switch and mobile probably the thing that mass or unite will be closest to and most recently Call of Duty mobile now let's talk about 10-cent 10-cent was launched in 2003 and has since grown into the leading global platform for game development pushing publishing and operations as well as the operator of the largest online game community in China it is dedicated to offering engaging high quality interactive entertainment experience there's a lot of buzzwords here experiences for all players Tencent offers more than 140 self-published and licensed games across 200 countries and regions which provides hundreds of millions of users cross-platform interactive some of their games would be honor of Kings Hub G mobile and League elections I don't see how League is not a direct competitor to arena valor unless you speak across platforms they are direct competitors but they're made by the same company technically I will get to what $0.10 owns and makes because there's a lot more it goes a lot deeper than that dota 2 because then that's just that they're making League League of dota furthermore 10 cents actively collaborates with overseas games such as s EA netmarble supercell and more to form strategic partnerships to launch new games and then they go on about what Nintendo we know about a Nintendo we know about Pokemon the interesting things here is time I and pen set okay there's a lot of news articles regarding this put them aside for now they should Pokemon unite what you guys think Oh I mean I'm super excited I enjoy the occasional MOBA I have played League I have played dota I have played arena of Valor and as long as all the players of those games keep playing their own games and fresh nice people play pokemon unite everything will be fine no email mains in my Pokemon unite okay I don't know your mobile history can you explain to what well you have MOBA in history right well look we got to save your dialogue for the new masters update later oh man Wow no will hit me with it what is a moba i've never played ice pokemon unite looks cool what what do i what am i doing in this game how is it similar to league arena of Valor don't exactly the same as all of them yeah there's there's so not any variation and I mean it does seem to be very similar in a valour of all of them but basically you have a map it's it's like a mirror map both sides are the same there's nothing fancy on one side that the other side's not getting everybody starts from the far end of the map so like the far corner and you head out and you have little towers but it's not a tower defense game although you do have to defend your towers and your goal is to basically keep progressing from your corner of the screen to your opponent's corner of the screen to take out their home base in the final end of glorious explosiveness and typically there are three channels three routes across the map that are Harry Mary heard the term o lanes three lanes yes and then you have somebody who's a top a mid or a bottom and you know it's basically you know which characters typically you would you know put like a support character in one lane and you know a different kind of character in another Lane and there's also the jungle which is the part of the map that's not the lanes and you can usually find other things I think in this announcement they said that you can find other Pokemon on the map that aren't part of either team and when you destroy those or make them faint you get buffs buff is a big word in them okay get buffs for your team and so probably that's what's gonna happen in the jungle as you'll have your jungle person go out there find whatever Pokemon are wandering around knock them out and then get those buffs um there's usually minions I haven't seen any minions in in Pokemon unite which are sort of NPCs that just vary single-mindedly go from one base you go heading towards the other base and they start attacking towers whenever they get close to one so I'm not sure how that's gonna work out and there's also typically a store with equipment and you as you are playing the game you generate gold or whatever currency and it's like every sets each game right every game you start from zero you set what you want to purchase from the store which are upgrades that once you hit the certain amount of gold from destroying your enemy or other characters on the map then you can purchase those upgrades and equip them and they give you more advantages as you go there's a lot a lot of moving pieces in a MOBA but it's basically go from the left to the right take out as much as you can along the way okay a couple follow-up questions here Greg Field feel free to chime in are all mobile is five verse five or is this some weird thing that Pokemon unites doing I feel like they missed an opportunity on six verse six but maybe hey not a hundred percent sure but I think that sounds right five by five is is fairly common okay I don't I can't say for sure that it's all but I mean that's pretty that's like League and we're probably Public League is the biggest mobile right I think your dota friends would disagree with yeah but sure I mean they're they're both similar I mean they're both like as high up as the other like I couldn't tell you which makes more money so I think the ranking is league is the most toxic dota is like the people who got tired of playing league but still need to get that MOBA fix and arena Valor is everybody who wants to play MOBAs but doesn't have a good PC ok I played heroes of the storm that's not a real game is - what I'm looking at right now is League is at 300,000 people watching on Twitch and dota is at a hundred and sixty seven thousand watching on twitch twitch obviously the end-all indicator of a popularity of a game of course when they did the announcement I went to twitch shortly after because people were like oh Pokemon six years late to the mobile thing and League was number one on twitch at the time and dota was number four on Twitch at the time and I was like are they really that late there's a lot of people watching these games yeah six years is not the right yeah timeline because I was playing league in 2013 which is seven years scandal is is there even there even an argument I like yeah I get it you know battle Royals are very big you know MOBAs didn't exist 20 years ago when are we gonna get a Pokemon but as long as like the game play is good and adaptive I mean like they keep making shooters every year they keep making racing games every year so I don't the idea that the expiration date on the MOBA style game has come and passed is patently false right like like man knoweth find shooters they have you know anymore I mean I'm sorry colleges and universities are are just beginning to scratch the surface of MOBAs as eSports like real college is talking about starting up an eSports program they're talking MOBAs and they're talking for tonight but yeah MOBAs are in the mix yeah those competitive league thinks heck there's so much money in that I don't understand why people love it people love the 5x5 III I don't think I've ever played a MOBA Oh shame did you know i but install heroes of the storm back in the day that's not real I went through it I went to the tutorial and it was it was to handhold II you know I was like this reminds me too much of Sun and Moon I gotta move now I'm just kidding it just it just didn't it didn't grab me and I thought you know out of all of them heroes would grab me cuz I was at the time playing a lot of Diablo 3 but that you know I just it just didn't grab me I've definitely played team-based games and I think some people would some people were arguing me with me that overwatch was very MOBA II but I was like I just thought overwatch is like a team-based shooter um there's a MOBA the MOBA feel of overwatch in that I think that over I still has five players with one side in five players on the other or is it four I have five sounds right well I mean it's it's a battle arena yeah it's not in that same you know top-down it's not the top down but it does have the similar like you're on a team you have objectives to get their points to connect to and you have to defend things I mean is it has some of the standard MOBA yeah without me being an actual MOBA I bought overwatch played it for a sum total of five minutes and said this game is not for me goodbye sixty dollars and so that's about as much as I know I've watched a lot of videos of people playing it but I knew when it wasn't when over art wasn't the next World of Warcraft MMO and that it was not at all what they had said it was going to with the type of game it was going to be and it became whatever watches would people love it but it just was absolutely not the game that I wanted I was like okay and people have people have a lot of fun with it but it just was never the game that I wanted Greg we didn't get your thoughts of the announcement I'm excited for it I think I've I've I've dabbled in the MOBA not a ton but I think any of the offshoot games where they just sort of try to expand out and see what fits and what's works it's it's certainly fun to see them playing with new ideas it could be hot garbage it could be a lot of fun there is something about playing the Pokemon and capturing at the Pokemon and sort of having a team aspect that doesn't exist in any other book of my product that has me excited to try Pokemon unite yeah that was when I saw it I was like wow this this looks cool MOBA never played a mobile that's my opportunity to play MOBA don't know if I like MOBAs but I really saw it as equal to like pokken tournament yeah when Poquelin they showed poking tournament I was like man I don't like fighting games but this looks rad I can play Chandeleur I can play suicune I can play Weavile and then I played it and I was like I'm glad they made this I'm glad you know somebody liked this I didn't like this but because I didn't like this I need to run to the Internet and let everyone know that I did not like this product I really wanted to like poke in tournament but I just don't like fighting games I enjoyed poking tearing it for what you know for what it was but fighting games don't remain Jam so I played it for as long as I played it and then left yeah I think I put probably 12 15 hours in a pokken tournament wouldn't mmm you know me if it but on Wii U we talked about how pokken tournament so let two point 1 million copies on switch which is very good yep actually as we're recording this they're doing the pokin player cup world champion this weekend and I try to watch a little bit of it and even though I like Pokemon and I understand how pokken tournament works I was not very interested in watching it hey some people like that and that's kind of where I I see I see unites right I'm gonna try unite it's free yeah I have nothing to lose you know if it was 20 bucks maybe 60 bucks I'd probably even purchase it and give it a try and then you know if I don't like it I just move on with life there's plenty of Pokemon games in my opinion that I do not like and that I've been very vocal about on the show Pokemon do for example Pokemon Rumble rush demon give that a try uh you know I didn't like auras when I first came out I've slightly changed my mind on that game over time but to me if you don't like a Pokemon game it's very easy to ignore it I think okay so let's get to the the complaint wait wait let me tell you first off before we get into that the top three things you're going to hear when you start playing pokemon unite guaranteed okay I'm not going to say it's in this order but these are the top three things number one why are you playing that Pokemon wrong okay alright number two why are you playing a Pokemon that you clearly don't know how to play okay yep number three I'm reporting you for poor sportsmanship just because you're not a good player okay what can I add a number four who's your main why are you not playing Charizard yeah and when chars learns not on the screen we need to ask where his heart is okay simpsons okay do we even know the lineup for unite yet like do we know everything that's in unite we know a handful of Pokemon I can name them for you we know that there's Blastoise Venus or Charizard timeframe okay we have Gengar Machamp and Snorlax we have Pikachu clefable which I'm into Kofi probably the weirdest one out of the bunch Lucario of course you know they don't they got to keep pushing Lucario the Roman reigns of Pokemon and talonflame is the ones we've seen so far talonflame is way overpowered Chinese we got oh here number for somebody nerf talonflame yeah nerf talonflame nerf so we have to assume given by the gameplay that we saw that they all start in their base lowest form because part of the gameplay was leveling up right you they they specifically said in the trailer you know you start out level 1 you will evolve and level up throughout they saw a Charmander evolve into a term e lien by knocking out something in the jungle I think and then eventually it was a Charizard I don't know how that works for Snorlax or Pikachu so but I mean do you think it's gonna be like munchlax to Snorlax Pichu - Pikachu's dry - yeah they're gonna be some that just start at level 1 at their full powered form which is going to create a problem I know that that's a thing in league and dota right you start at level 1 every game and you yeah you get stuff so I would assume that you start out like riolu and then you go to Luke re that's what I would guess so cleffa Clefairy kill fable that's my main I know how to play it I using unique strategy when I can finally power up and go off you will all be impressed stop harassing it's called ulting when you use your halt and we don't know that there's alt in here yet it is the R key on your keyboard they did they specifically said like each Pokemon will have like a superpower thing that will determine the Matt I'm like okay it's no it's gonna have an all alt so the complaints the the issues here there there's like three specific complaints number one I don't I've played mobos I don't like MOBAs that's a completely fair complaint if you've you know you've played League you played her the arena valor you played dota you don't like it that's a super fair complaint but what are they complaining about just that because the promise is not a fair complaint if you're saying therefore this game shouldn't exist oh it's a complaint yeah I don't want I'm not gonna play this game because I don't like them but if it's used as I've seen it a lot saying and therefore they should have never have made this game that is not a valid complaint because you don't like it doesn't mean it should have been created right yes correct but it you know if somebody came into my stream or whatever and they're like and I'm there like I'm bummed or like ah the announcement didn't do it for me and I was like oh what did you like what was the issue with the announcement they're like I you know I played a lot of League I just don't care about MOBAs anymore that's fine it's fine there's nothing wrong with that complaint number two is it wasn't whatever remake in the entire world the it wasn't let's go Merrill it wasn't hey you girafarig it wasn't Pokemon Z it wasn't sparkling diamond flashy pearl it wasn't any remake but Steve in the last week's trailer they had a chikorita and a Reiko behind Ishihara and obviously because they had gen 2 plushies and I ignore the fact that they had literally had Gen 1 plushies and gen 7 plushies and everything else but if I only focus on the gen 2 plushies Greg why am I being attacked why was there no hey you merrill to remake did you not see the suicune behind him I did and that just says that suicune is in Pokemon unite all those Pokemon that were shown back there are playable Pokemon in Pokemon unite you just drew the wrong conclusion so this is this is a huge complaint people were people set their own expectations they overhyped it I the mental gymnastics of people being like this announcement would have been better if they didn't make us wait a week is a really weird complaint of like because they made us wait a week poor you what did you did you camp outside for a week did you like not leave your house because you were so enthralled with insight like excitement that it them saying you have to wait a week for more news possibly affected your day-to-day life look I have not slept that's a week waiting for my Johto remakes Gen 20 and I didn't get them and therefore the Pokemon company hates me I just don't buy the excuse of like well if they didn't wait a week people wouldn't have been as mad like I just say what I think would have been as mad the Pokemon company needs to listen to some more Lana Del Ray hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me right can't lie can't get people hope and then yank that rug out from under their feet I rewatched the original present and they just said we have a big announcement next week that's all they said and then all they said on Twitter they said hey just a reminder Pokemon announcement on Wednesday hey what did you like just say to go to the lengths of saying oh this is this is game freaks fault also not games freaks fault because they they had nothing to do with announcement a and announcement B but this is the Pokemon company's fault that they overhyped it and now we're upset Walt there's no even if they were even if you believe for a second they overhyped it what did you want them to say at the end of the present the conference we got a big announcement next week or hey we got some average old game made by a Chinese company next week uh some of you will like it something you won't see you then like what do you then these out zero companies in the entire world do not say is not a big announcement zero companies Amazon will say we have a big announcement next week you know what it is we put a LexA in a toaster done big animated I'm sure I am actually sure that product is the Pokemon company is the same company let me tell you 2016 the World Championship they said we have a big announcement does anyone remember what that big announcement was I remember what it is I know 2015 2016 I reverse the ground championship well didn't I I don't think they have Blatter no DC no that was to go Hawaii I think Hawaii well maybe it was after anyways it was the Year Sun and Moon came out in November Slowbro their big announcement then that's what they said they said we have a big announcement at Worlds their big announcement was they showed row brawler that was their big announcement at the World Championship they showed one new Pokemon not even that cool of a Pokemon was crew brawler this is not a new pattern or thing that the Pokemon company has done I would argue that showing a brand new Pokemon is a big announcement heads I think is pretty big they showed a brand new Pokemon never before seen at the World Championship I would also go on the record saying showing a brand new Pokemon video game is a big announcement whether or not you left it in the record put it in the record official statement and testimony this will be used against you in the court of Pokemon law I will have you know I just don't buy that like because they made us wait a week because I had to get up at 6:00 a.m. uh in California to watch this and it was 11 minutes long because it was because they used the word big announcement that this is their fault that people are mad it is not you okay life lesson you all are control of your own emotions and the stories that you tell yourselves if the story that you told yourself over a week is that you are going to get exactly what you wanted you are telling yourself a false story and therefore you are mad that you lied to yourself for a week putting that on somebody else is called projecting stop projecting your disappointment in your own manifestation of excitement that was based off of nothing on another company or another series of people also the statement that I can't believe Pokemon is wasting resources on a game that I don't want they are not making this game well gosh that we can do a whole nother podcast about how games a little like how like a half the Internet just think things making a game is so easy yeah I mean copy and paste it's just copy and paste get that what does that engine called unreal get the Unreal Engine pokemons in there and you're good to go yeah you just get the assets from Pokemon company you get the Unreal Engine from the Unreal company copy paste it prints cache we're we're also talking about the same fan base for probably the last five years the last time the Pokemon the last time Game Freak this is this is where the wording is is I this is where the wording is weird the last time Game Freak took off a year was in 2015 so 2016 with Sun in Sun and Moon 2017 ultra Sun and Moon 2018 go Pikachu let's go Eevee 2019 sword and shield 2020 sword and shield DLC it took off 2015 and then in 2014 was Omega Ruby alpha sapphire in 2013 was X&Y so when we when we heard sword and shield when we when we were getting sword and shield one of the biggest complaints besides they cut my pokeman they cut my huntail I'm very upset I'm not buying this game how could they leave Clamperl and hunt a lout was there making games too fast specifically they as in Game Freak I've said that on this podcast before probably eight years ago I said I don't want Pokemon to be a Call of Duty I don't want in every I don't want Pokemon every single year if it's not quality so I've said these same words too so I also just don't understand this I feel like it's there's that there's a Venn diagram of people that vocally complained all through sword and shield that it was lazy it was rushed they're putting out games too quickly I'm more than willing to wait a year for a quality product and then I feel like the Venn diagram overlaps - so Argan shield is only like eight months old and we just got we just got brand new dlc two weeks ago slow down I don't think the Venn diagram overlaps this much this you're stating I think the general outrage when one group quiets down there is more than a happy another happy group to file right in and to continue that outrage level I don't think the people who are mad at national Ducks are suddenly like oh my gosh they're not giving me diamond and pearl remakes I think they've just gone off to sulk and then people who want their remakes who expect games every year who want that have filled in the power vacuum of complaining I mean there are a tremendous number of Pokemon fans out there rock can be cut into different groups of what we like to complain about I will I will tell you gen 3 fans might be my favorite hey they announced heartgold SoulSilver Gen 2 fans rejoice gen3 fans they came out of their cabins they looked at the sky and they said soon our time is coming and they were pretty loud they they went out they bought brand new trumpets they marched around for several years they finally got omega ruby set alpha sapphire and then they showed up we never heard from again under they went back into their cabins they put their trumpet under their bed they sat it on their their lazy boy recliner and they've been playing Omega Ruby alpha sapphire fit since we haven't seen them but the day every week the day that they announced Omega Ruby alpha sapphire every Gen 4 fanboy just shot up from their bed they put their pants on and they they they said my time is now here we go but during this time of this great war gen 3 people being happy and Gen 4 people being like it is our time now the gen 2 people go it's not good enough for us we're back we need another remake gold and silver and now we have gold and silver and diamond and pearl fans just clamoring for something new and ok I agree they need to remake gen 2 into a good game they do and the gen 5 fans are waiting but you my word they're all gonna crawl up ok know who had the underground bases that was four that's more those four Gen 4 Gen 4 needs to crawl back under the ground to the underground secret bases but at June 5 have 25 has a secret they had they had seasons they had good gameplay they had weed seas and they had the starting see ya night and day loaded TMS they had decent PC boxes man Gen 5 is a good game whoa now did now finally after all of my years of everything finally some recognition yes this is this is the thing we're gonna hear once once Gen 4 remakes are announced this gen fives are gonna be like finally you people can appreciate the depression we've been living in for it's my season so that didn't happen and you know that could have happened right they announced Ultra Sun ultramoon pretty quickly after Sun and Moon but I and I don't know if we said this last week or I said this last week could they have announced a a remake of an old game yeah sure they could literally announced a tooth-brush game last week like they could announce anything but I think it's really important from a company perspective if you're going to do DLC for the first time you don't announce another game that could possibly conflict with that right especially when you have stockholders that are looking at your at your products and they the stockholders probably would be like what about a new game because we know what that does we know that a third version of a game moves millions and millions of copies I feel like it's just very important for them to focus this year on the DLC and you know maybe and maybe tomorrow they announced diamond and pro remakes so they could do whatever they want but it's it's gonna come eventually look they're going to make Jenna they're gonna make Jen ten games they're gonna make Jen eleven games they're gonna remake Jen six they're gonna remake Jen seven they're gonna remake gen8 all of these things will eventually be coming because it's been proven time and time again that it that it works last thing I want to say before we get to 0.3 which is the ten cent issue is the the people that are like they should have switched snap and this game and I wholeheartedly disagree with that there is no way may snap will probably sell four million copies it will probably do much much better than pokken tournament but pokemon unite will probably make four million dollars in the first week didn't-didn't masters make like 23 million in the first month I think yeah even better than that let me tell you 100% what were we're not seeing this behind the curtain pokken tournament was supposed to be Pokemon eSports and nobody wanted it guess what Pokemon unite will be Pokemon eSports and they're banking on makin Jabez brazil's Dillion dillion's out of having competitive tournaments and people buying tickets and all the hype that's gonna go around that absolutely they didn't even announce like holiday 2024 snap I don't think that games coming out this year no I think we wrote I think we roll into a beta slash early program for or this is this is actually what I think because there were some people saying that this shouldn't have been its own trailer and I think those people are wrong and I think those people forgot that they did like a two-minute silhouette of a bunch of people trading cards linking their game boys battling battling their cards playing pokken tournament and I don't know 18 different scenes of people cheering at world tournaments there's not a doubt in my mind that this trailer was supposed to be for the 2020 World Championship that day they showed there's not a single doubt that this wasn't that this was like some tacked-on thing that they did last-minute no I'm confident and they'll never they'll never say this the Pokemon company will never admit this that this trailer was meant for the World Championship they were going to show it to a bunch of people at the World Championship that are excited for battle and it would have went over extremely well but instead there was a bunch of crybabies that woke up at 6 a.m. and they saw the trailer and it wasn't what they wanted and now they had to scream on the internet that they had to do some sort of mental gymnastics of how how this was the worst thing in the entire world and the Pokemon company will cease to exist in two weeks because of this announcement last part of this argument of why people were maybe upset the 10 cent deal it was 56,000 dislikes whatever that's worth nothing three million people watched it a hundred and fifty six million dislikes is a drop in the bucket to three million whatever doesn't none of that matters beside the talking point I guess so ten cent is it ten cent is like if you don't know ten cent I'll try to explain it as easy as possible ten cent is like Amazon and Microsoft and Disney all merged into a company and made pretty much everything music games Home Shopping Network it's just basically Disney yeah in its own right there yeah 10/7 is a very very very big Chinese company if we if we take a step out Pokemon recently made their first attempt in China with Sun and Moon that was the first games with traditional and simplified chinese mandarin and cantonese cantonese cantonese cantonese cantonese thank you that's not to say you know somebody in China didn't import a game right but right putting games on shelves there so even if you think for a second that you Knight was not made for you there there are fans in other countries besides America spoiler Japan does have internet there are Pokemon fans all over the world specifically in China so it is possible that the Pokemon company doesn't care about everyone else and specifically wants us to succeed in China that is possible but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing if Pokemon fans are still Pokemon fans regardless of where they live and there are limitations to play stuff in China and if this is their way to give those fans something more that's that's fine like that's the same thing with Pokemon smile I mean it's meant for little kids just because it's not meant for you doesn't mean it wasn't still a thing that they should have made but some people have a problem with $0.10 and I'm not here you defend $0.10 there's a lot of not great companies in the world but I can give you the history of tenza I can tell you what games they have made and they are they're the largest tech Kalama grant Kalama grant McCollum and glomer itch yes they're that in China they're the biggest one they are the world's largest video game publisher they both provide Internet and entertainment in China this ok so this is off PC gamer this was published October 4th 2019 so relatively recently we'll just go through this they are both the internet and entertainment giant in China they are the equivalent of a Facebook or a Google but gamers worldwide are probably more familiar with $0.10 investments in to a growing number of game developers and publishers they have 300 investments in their portfolio staying on top of every company that $0.10 has a stake in can be daunting so the author here is creative a list of $0.10 public investments in foreign gaming companies basically companies outside of China including where possible how much of the company Tencent owns alright so let's start with number one when I get games who makes League of Legends and they own a hundred percent of Riot Games so that's big League of Legends undoubtably a very very good game yep in 2011 10 cent went from being riots gaming publisher partner in China to the Madera and majority stake holder after paying 400 million dollars for a 93 percent stake in League of Legends four years later $0.10 got the remaining 7% for an undisclosed amount taking full control over Riot Games just as League of Legends was exploding as in eSports around the world and then League of Legends the most popular PC game in the world pulling an estimated 1.4 billion in revenue last year riot riot games remain remains largely free to steer the game how it pleases but that relationship has some ugly downsized wanting to cash in on the mobile game boom boom 10 cent tried to get riot to make a mobile version of lol when the developer refused $0.10 went ahead made their own mobile version clone of lol called arena of Valor that became one of the most popular mobile games in Asia riot was not happy about this that is now mostly water under the bridge now that 10-cent abandon arena valor in the West and riot is now making a mobile version of League of Legends so there's your first one now you can say Greg Steve will I don't play League of Legends this doesn't matter rod I'm never going to play a 10-cent game let's move on to number two because I guarantee you're using a 10 cent product at the end of this podcast Epic Games they own 40% 10 cent invested three hundred and thirty million dollars into Epic Games in 2012 triggering one of the most dramatic shifts in PC gaming in the last decade assuring a new era of free-to-play games epic scrapped Unreal Engine 4 monthly subscription in favor of a free version where epic earned royalties on sales the biggest epic game okay at the same time epic began experimenting with Live to services like Paragon and fortnight while both games uh or died save the world while both the games were failures save the world to put epic into a perfect spot to jump on the battle royal bandwagon almost by accident creating the biggest gaming pop-culture phenomenon since minecraft in Pokemon last year fortnight made 2.4 billion making it the most profitable game that year so now you say well Steve I don't play League of Legends I don't I don't play for it night I don't I can't even do that Flashdance Tencent owns 11.5% of blue hole which is players unknown battleground 10 cent owns both fortnight and a piece of both fortnight and pub g2 dominant battle Royales what's more amusing is that 10 cent also has the rights to publish both games in China meaning that it's actual it's an actual competition with itself not a bad place to be in 10 cents investment in Blue Hole became apparent in 2017 during 1.5% of blue hole and then increasing that for an undisclosed amount rumor to be about 10% it is rumored that $0.10 will be trying to it will is rumor that $0.10 is seeking a complete accusation of blue hole currently wait how much of Apex legends 2 they own apex is EA will get there well let's go get there you look you don't like battle Royals I get it right you don't like the pup G you don't like the fortnight not interested in the League of Legends I like watching them what if I told you that $0.10 helped Ubisoft survive I don't play in a Ubisoft games that's not true they own 5% of Ubisoft at the time and they took it over from the vendee who at the time was Ubisoft's largest stakeholder for years Vivendi has steadily acquired a stake in Ubisoft hoping to aus its founders and seizing control for itself putting out thousands of jobs the situation looked grim Ubisoft struck a deal with vid than the vendee that saw the French conglomerate divest its stake in a variety of investors that included 10 cent as part of its agreement though 10 cent is just a silent partner that Inc cannot increase its voting rights in its ownership of Ubisoft making a hostile takeover by $0.10 impossible the acquisition of Ubisoft shared also the acquisition of Ubisoft shares also was a strategic partnership where $0.10 would publish Ubisoft games in China so if you're playing Assassin's Creed in China Tencent published it now Greg you stay away from all these games some would say that Ubisoft games I'm would say maybe you're a fan of the overwatch of the Diablo or the World of Warcraft even I left that I left that life behind well not 10 cents they own 5% of Activision Activision Blizzard how much have Square Enix do they own like this is a longer that's how we get Greg yeah so far so far you're batting zero years for your you deserve times that helped another company escape to the vendee act Blizzard Activision fell under vividness control back in 2007 when it merged in order to join forces with Blizzard benefiting from the enormous success of world Warcraft five years later the merged companies of Activision Blizzard's announced a deal to buy back the vendee stake in the company to become an independent and $0.10 jumped at the opportunity bought 5% of Activision Blizzard for an undisclosed amount there's another big game that I think will purse I personally think this game will get even bigger in the next year I don't think any of us play it 10 cent owns 80% of grinding Gear games which make half of Exile and I think packs of Exile hasn't exploded yet it's very very popular but I think it will get a lot bigger this year next year how much of garden escaped - they own 100% we're getting there so other investments worth noting supercell they make games like clash of clans clash royale boom beach $0.10 owns eighty four point three percent they investment leave them behind eight point six billion dollars into the finished mobile developer one of the biggest purchases in videogame history you know there's there's some fans out there they love the bayonetta they love the they love the what's the other game that people near automata they love the Platinum I hear this all the time platinum games they make good games guess what ten cents invested a undisclosed amount in platinum games ten cent owns an undisclosed amount as of February of 2020 into jäger the developer of spec ops coca a South Korean entertainment enter entertainment and Internet company with the mega hit black desert online ten cent owns thirteen thirteen point five percent of that game paradox entertainment they own five percent of that they make hearts of iron to fat shark thirty / 6 percent of fat shark they make Warhammer that is the second-largest Swedish developer that's hence have invested in 29% of fun come they make Conan exile as a secret world shark mob they own a hundred percent of that their studio that made they used to make the division and hitman they were fully bought by ten cent in 2019 I like the division that was a good game you're listening to this podcast you're like I hate ten cent I don't play League of Legends I don't play a supercell games I don't play path of Exile but you better believe I'm gonna complain on discord about Pokemon unite guess what discord received one hundred and fifty eight million dollars in funding including an undisclosed amount from ten cents that's where they got me that's okay I don't use discord I am on are slash are slash Pokemon complaining about ten cent hate to break it to you read it got a hundred and fifty million investment from ten seconds I thought reddit was owned by that magazine publisher they do Vogue and GQ oh goodness why did it just leap out of my brain Condon asked oh oh they're in trouble well maybe that's why they needed the investment yeah they needed the investment I have verified that garden escapes is made by play Rick's which has no involvement with ten cent so I think garden escapes is like still top ten most profitable mobile mobile games though I believe I certainly put a lot of money into it yeah so the whole point of that wasn't to like convince you that ten cents a good company you can do your own research about that a lot of fans that I saw over the week they they told me that they would never ever ever do anything that involved ten cent but ten senators surprised yeah surprised ten son is way more than just a couple very big video games they have their hand and read it they have their hand in discord and and leave they're called tendrils at this point they have long given up on the inefficiency of Hana and in five years when ten cent comes to America and they're battling Amazon Microsoft Apple and Disney for full ownership of our lives we'll remember this podcast battling is in quotes the amount of collusion that happens with all the big companies would shock you I hope that Pokemon unite is good I hope it's fun I hope it's I hope it's great I hope it's not super money grabby I believe in League of Legends and both dota there's no pay to win it's just you pay money for hats or skins I think dota is the Hat I'll get those skins man you don't get those skins I have to pick up Mane that has a bad shiny so I'm not tempted to buy it shiny skin don't know what it's like for a Rena Valor which I guess is probably the comparable one will I don't know if you played that one on switch I didn't play it enough to find out where it be throwing money but you can do all of these games you just jump into a 5v5 match right there's no like must pay a ninety nine cents to do your daily match or whatever that's correct and and to go back to the actual develop here time I you know I'm not huge a I'm not a huge Call of Duty fan but I've I heard call of duty mobile was pretty good oh those Call of Duty junkies will this remake Call of Duty what await that's our we spent a lot of time on unite there was lots of cover no date but I expected if there was to be a World Championship this year that they probably would have had kiosks kiosk is kiosks set up at the World Championship to play ah no no no if if you night came out before the World Championships I can guarantee you it would have been one of the competitive things because people are going to like the mobile folks are just gonna be like already there their fingers are on cue wer and on their Mouse there are good too although it's only mobile and switch isn't it boy arena valor is not I mean for me I died getting a long time to get the controls for destiny you like to click it so so this is this well before we take break last question so if you look at something like pokken tournament I don't know how many I don't know how many fans from like Mortal Kombat or dead or alive or Tekken I like Pokemon and I want to try new fighting game and moved over versus how many people that were like I don't really I'm not really in that scene but I like Pokemon and I'm in that scene so the same thing with unite are there going to be people who are who their life is League of Legends and they decide to try this and then just go back to League oh they'll they'll never leave Lee yeah once you're in league you don't ever get out that's that's just what I know in my example there's me who's never moba who's like I might like this and it might be a game that I play on a daily or weekly basis if I like it which is a big big if it's a big if I don't know what the crossover is though well I mean who knows like I'm sure there are people who casually play League of Legends wish they could be better at it but like it doesn't excite them and this will excite them they're getting in at the ground floor they get to be a part of the community like there'll be a certain amount of people who jump in and be like this is what I've been waiting for forever I've tried other mobile games but I'm just not yeah I'm so far but I feel like I'm so far behind because they've been out for so long like this is a fresh start for a lot of people and it could be huge it could I really tell you I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen okay it's a cycle you're gonna get League players who and it's like every like a quarter a new fresh crop of these dudes show up where they're like I'm so tired of how toxic the league community is I can't stand I don't want to play this game II wear I've got to stop playing league and then there's but you know I can play pokemon unite because it's like League and it's not doesn't have that toxic and then they're gonna play that for three months and then they're gonna start jonesing again because you know the new skins came or they've got a new champion or something and then they're just gonna they're gonna like put Pokemon unite aside and then they're going to be back into League hardcore for six months and then they go oh my god this community is so toxic Lee players are the worst I can't leave you know again it to be six o'clock at night and all the little kids go for dinner and they're afk and I'm just like so frustrated everybody on my team sucks why are you playing a support main in that lane and why didn't you alt at that and then they but Pokemon unite is gonna be sitting there waiting for them and they're gonna be like alright here's like it's like The Children's Tylenol for you know when you've just had too much league codeine and it's just like I need to step away and get my children's Tylenol and then you play pokemon unite for a little while even if this is a failure in the West does it mean that's a failure for the Pokemon company because it could still be very very popular in China or Korea or Japan or Australia or I don't know maybe the UK players are over the moon for this I guess we just don't know but I thought they'd not so it was fine I thought the game looked cool I hope that it's good I hope the free to start isn't completely garbage I still think Pokemon masters is a little too expensive I think that Pokemon go is pretty reasonable I thought Magikarp jump was good money-wise I thought Pokemon Quest was really good out of the all of the you know quote-unquote free to start I think Pokemon quest did it perfectly it was like here's spend $25 you got everything now but you don't you don't have to spend $20 you could you could just do it I think Animal Crossing is too expensive the mobile one I thought oh yeah yep I think pocket camps a complete ripoff if it's anything like MOBAs you should just be buying hats or skins or clothes yeah it's probably a guy in the shiny yeah yeah bad Chinese at this point in time Pokemon is only flex so that doesn't that was it when we come back we're going to talk about story stuff in DLC so if you if you don't want to hear that look at the podcast app where everything is timed out just it'll be it'll be DLC story just skip to the next section the times will all be there if you don't want to hear it and then we're gonna talk about Pokemon DLC new feature two masters bug off event and then that'll be it so we will be right back [Music] [Applause] [Music] we are back sword and shield dlc story talk alright five seconds here we go hop shows up story over yep thanks for the spoiler we warned you you could have skipped being in this segment really really we would have just texted you hey come back wait how far are you in the story we'll let me preface by saying I am enjoying the aisle of armor probably a hundred and fifty three times more than I liked all of sword and shield and in reflecting and wondering why that might be I think I've come to the realization that the fact that all of the Pokemon hunting you do in the aisle of armor is the same and there are no routes that are separated from the wild area and it's all wilder I love it I'm having a great time interesting still some of the same issues of like how the Pokedex tells you which ones to get and whatever that's but I'm good friends with my buddy Kapoor he hops up and down every time we have battles and he's real excited and just like yeah all that good stuff gave him a shell bail you know how to do and they said well pick a tower and I walked up to one of the towers and they were like well if you do this tower blah blah blah you can only do one you can't blah blah and then I was like well you know I'm gonna do the dark tower cuz it reminds me of that 80's game that I used to board game that I used to love to play then she's like after I've listened to her speech and everything she says make sure your cub foo is level 70 or you're not gonna have a good time and I was like me and my cub who are besties and he's only level 51 so I turned away and also ii uh it's not a preface any longer interjection and note to footnote whatever you want to call it i do not use those candies that the the pseudo rare candies i've never even used rare candies when rare candies were a thing i level up my pokemon the natural way no i say okay on battles you don't lovely yourself up the natural way but you have to do it for Pokemon I'd what what are you talking about we know about your secret steroid use I am a natural lifter sir no matter what my Instagram haters might say oh we got the real scoop we got the real scoop I got the cup foo I got it's a max friendship and then somebody in my stream was like well it's gonna take you a couple hours through the tower I said couple hours capital out words I hope I get levels with five bosses right yeah I open up my inventory I go to my 900 min max l Excel candies I get Cub food in 93 in about 4 seconds no not gonna do it and as I did that to my Center scorch and I still hell hate myself for it and I said couple hours we're ready to go right now yep I love it boost it up why wait cuz I'm not a game gobbler that's why that's right all right Greg yes give me the thoughts of the story you're the story guy I am the story guy the story is boring boring yeah it's pretty boring know what I mean so it starts out like it starts out fairly promising like the the pseudo villain that you face there you know they're rising character the pseudo villain let's be real that whole thing is fine is just that never really varies off in any interesting tracks at all you you get this into this dojo where you're not supposed to because some poor some poor trainer is left at the train station forever while you take their spot oh he leaps yeah oh I thought that was a okay so they there's a spoiler this whole thing's a spoiler that dude comes back at the end and it's a super nice touch hmm yeah you you can miss that part so when you when you like get off the train there's like the professor professor scientists and she's like come back to me when you find all the Pokemon and then there's that just that NPC that's standing in the corner and I would assume most people just think he's an NPC and then just leave but if you talk to him he's like I'm too scared to go to the dojo and then they acknowledge it when you get there where honey is like oh that's not the name we have written down but you're here so let's just do it and then they make that guy come back at the end is like they actually did they actually that actually did something yeah the story serves one purpose which is to introduce you to all of the other competitive features and that's all the story does like it really doesn't expand the world that dearly doesn't do a whole lot for lore wise it's honey and mustard which just bothers me deeply their names or their caregivers their names like this um again look Melanie's name in Japanese is melon I mean I'm not saying that they're the bastions of creativity it that Sri does what it's supposed to do and that's fine it is a story driven by mechanics mainly and it's incredibly short it's not it's not particularly surprising that like you know who's gonna be at the top of the towers you know oh you know I don't know who's gonna be at the top of the tower yeah you do if you think about it for like half a second you know who's gonna be at the top of the tower well I guess I'm not thinking the same way it's just yeah it's fine it's just not very deep and then I had a little hope when the hop shows up for that sorry line to be a little bit more interesting and it just again it's just to serve the main purpose to get you to understand these mechanics that they're introducing you in the game which is a good way to introduce and get you to know the mechanics it's a good way of showing you yeah everything the game has to offer instead of being like what they did with Festival brazo was like here you go good luck figuring it out but it doesn't make a good story I I definitely agree that the story short but not unexpected like I I assumed that we were gonna get like I would probably argue that the story's like three to four hours if you get distracted yeah if you get distracted it's it's an hour tops if you don't yeah but if you don't get distracted I don't I don't know what you're really looking for in a Pokemon game I don't get how you do it like I honestly don't get how you'd not be distracted by the while there if I the Pokemon by exploring like they do the thing that people ask for we talked about this last week of just instead of crossing that Diglett bridge you can just go out to that giant whale or you can go out to these islands you can you can start doing raids you can find the hidden cave off the water and then all of a sudden you're in a cave and you're like behind you can find that yeah you can avoid it all and explore so distractions to the storyline don't enhance the storyline distractions say yes it you can easily spend a lot of time in aisle of armor that's not the issue I love armor as a DLC is good there are a lot of things to do the storyline is short and shallow if you only focus on the story if like I'm gonna knock out this story you are there for maybe an hour tops yeah that's that's it's it's it's not to say it's not saying that there's a lot of great things to do in aisle of armor because there are it's just to say the story is not it's not surprising it's not fantastic it is a mechanics driven story and that takes away from what could have been there I do think there will be much more story in the next expansion which is a lot more about exploring and this was very different I hope that story is better this one it's fine it's not it is not a revelation it is not particularly interesting I liked it or I liked to the length I liked that it was kind of short war wise which is not story wise I think like the trainer cards for mustard and honey and you know honey will even offer to battle you and stuff I think that's done really well yeah um and I think all the lore of the characters you know opal and Melanie and Gordie and B and Alastair Alec I think though they they put so much thought into these characters they just don't give them spots to shine they're like right here's your battle with them you're done the primary problem with the story of how sword and shield is presented is that to find the interesting bits you have to go find them they aren't they aren't provided to you as part of your ongoing story and that's it's it's an interesting choice there's a lot of story and lore to be had I I prefer it when you are shown those things in the world as part of the story and not like an aftereffect when I look at so-and-so's card and I realize all of these cool things that I really wish I would have seen in the story itself yeah exactly it's like show me don't tell me this is mechanics but I think the dude I guess the word is like fetch quests yeah do these fetch quests I think is better than battle these four trainers to move on to the next part of this story I don't think they were perfect no and they mixed both right like you it was definitely flipped between do these fetch quests then do these battles then do these fetch quests that do these battles like it flips between them and I think I want that more in Pokemon games of oh I guess you know we had that like when you first play like gold and silver they're like deliver this egg yeah so it's not like this is the first time they've done that kind of stuff yeah didn't they drop it halfway good then it's there's all battles but I think so it was it was definitely fun and delightful to see a bunch of slowpoke zooming around yeah that was cute they do some cute moments like there are some fun moments sure and I think they give cub few enough time to shine yeah and I think it just proves that if the Pokemon company takes time to focus on a pokemon people end up liking that Pokemon more yeah I mean there are some downsides like it's basically the island of triplets everybody in the dojo looks exactly right yeah you know there's a lot of like there's a lot of those things that make like the dojo feel a little more shallow then they could be like if they had just taken some of the models that they had used elsewhere in the game and just put them in dojo clothes like if they weren't all these fit people if there were some you know older people who were hanging around if they'd just taken other models and put them in this clothing and dumped him in there dojo would have felt more full and allied other models they have 40 hairs just change up a hair now they all had to wear at the man bun yeah I mean you're complaining about models I literally live in Stowe on side and do you buy something standing next to him who sells you something are exactly the things I believe they're brothers though to be fair they lie you're twins twins are popular in the Pokemon world sure know this that's true okay the other part of the DLC when you do fight mustard at the top of the tower spoiler and he like rips off his like Rambo hoodie and I think that I think the problem and maybe this is maybe this is what you haven't said yet Greg but you but your thinking is that mustard is such a good character they don't give him enough time and they easily could have easily like he's such a good character he is a great character that they just don't do enough with I do really enjoy that every time he sends you out for a mission and uh and like you're in the middle of doing it but you haven't finished it yet he's playing switch what yes he is he's playing Pokemon quest yeah he yells at you yeah I've done that several times like mustard has a ton of great personality and well honey and mustard both do they just there's just not enough story to let them really shine yeah I think that's a good complaint I don't know yeah I don't know if the islands like big enough to give them to give you more story though like what else I think the thing I worry about and I think why I liked this story better is because I go back and I think of Orin as his Delta episode which I felt like was twice as long as this and I hated every minute of it because it was like fly here talk to this person why here talk to this person and I was like I don't want to do that I don't want to feel like exactly what happened this what happened in this one - it's just all contained in one island and the entire know why the exact the only difference is that this is the only difference is that this is entirely a new Island is the exact same quest is the exact same quest of the Delta episode but you in the Delta episodes you are visiting places you had already seen which is not the case for this one which makes it new and exciting it's the same story look I'm not saying I'm easily tricked I'm just just I'm just like the delta episode was too long and didn't have variety and there was variety between knocking out slowpoke climbing a tower finding mushrooms and doing that vespiquen raid was you have you have the wildest remembrance you like to ignore a lot of what happened in the Delta episode oh man okay you climb a tower at the end of the Delta episode but that's also not great either it's a lot of talking to not stephen stohn that his dad I don't remember his dad or his nephew whoever's the dude in the the stone museum or whatever you got to talk to that guy like 40 times but for me it was it was like talking to that dude in the beginning having honey acknowledge it having that dude showed up put a smile on my face cuz they they they actually did the thing of acknowledging the the silly dialogue they put into games and they did the thing where they acknowledge Leon's lostness finally where mustard tells you that like you're one of the few first students in like several years that I've ever gotten this far and the reason that Leon who was like his greatest disciple or whatever doesn't have a cup foo is cuz he couldn't figure out which tower to go to like he got lost getting to the towers and I was like this is oh wait then he should have a cup for ya he just doesn't have an ear she yeah yeah probably so like them acknowledging that was like finally they like use this lostness thing yeah cleverly cleverly yeah yeah whereas it didn't really make sense in the like him getting lost like he didn't get lost to save the world he didn't get lost to like show up for a stadium match but because he got lost and couldn't find a tower was like cool you acknowledged it that's yeah that's awesome they do cute touches there are cute touches throughout the very short Channel story the music was really great especially for mustard you played with the music on oh yeah you got to oh yeah mustard I mean mustard songs a banger I mean secret the reason about he enjoys these things more is because he has an audience and he's not playing them alone ah look at was about polka music I I mean like I guess the answer is like what how do you want them to make it longer without adding pointless battles which is which it was the worry it was the word going into the dlc what are the how they gonna do this I'm not asking for more battles I'm asking for more exploration as to what the Isle of armor is let's talk about why all these wildly varying biomes are here let's talk about exploring the history of why the towers are there let's explore like I don't need more battles I need more lore and more story I mean yeah why is your valuable dress so weird like I can't like if you want me to sit down and creatively write an additional story give me a couple of weeks tonight I will I can write a ton of stories that happen I don't know what I communicate that though because we saw that they did this in Sun and Moon where they added these cut scenes and people were like ah okay cut scenes too long the game is 90% cut scenes well that's because they stacked all the cut scenes up front if you're gonna go off of one people's complaints then you're gonna have to say well then they shouldn't do this our national debt I just saying how would you do it you can say I want to write more lower and I want more story but how do you want them to put that into the game that's what I'm asking do you want like characters standing outside the tower giving you lore do you want mustard - yeah thank you more than they should do it like destiny you pick up little pieces of cry no one wants to do that cried I mean I'd rather do that than find a hundred and fifty Diglett two million Ling's like they could easily for postgame stuff have trainers from other regions come and say hey take me to this area I've never seen this I'm trying to catch this you know there's a ton of ways that they could bring other characters from the entire Pokemon universe to this that you would interact it on a daily basis or musters you could say hey we're getting a bunch of new arrivals who are coming today we're getting a new class can you go pick them up at the train station have a little bit's about that and they can talk more about a bunch of like there's a million ways you can do that like it's not it like the sky's the limit they can do whatever they wish what do I want I would love to have daily visitors I would love to have people from really visitors though that are off from the region yeah yeah yeah but they say listen theists show up or I would like to see a Wallace and Steven stone vacationing in Galler for a while and going on their second honeymoon like all of these things they could do to extend the story to give more to the story thanks like a million things they can do like if the story continued after posting like making postgame story optional is perfectly fine by me like if it was one hour but I can choose to go talk to these people to do more things to learn more about this region I would love that so what I'm hearing is you hate it then you need to real isn't it yeah no I think I think I think those are good complaints I didn't think they were gonna do it right this time and I think they got I think they got that didn't I don't think they did it wrong I stand by it's a solid B it's a solid B great you know really good way better than average I give it a fourth grade a junior year B so the part we talked about last week if you don't finish the postgame then hop doesn't show up so when you beat mustard at the top of whatever tower you choose and you go back to the dojo hop is there he's there to be his professor or to help Sonja they hint that Sonja's in a snowy area I don't know if people caught that hint yeah so she'll obviously come back for the crown Tundra unless she doesn't survive yeah that's true by the time we get there she could be frozen solid yep and so hop wants you I think the hop stuff is mostly to Giganta max you're a chief ooh yeah teach you about the soup and mustard and confirmed if you have not done all the way to hot decide hop decides to do that what after you do the battle to catch one of the wolves right or you battle him again you have to do the whole sword bird and shield Bert story yeah which is after that because I know people who people are asking me on Twitter what do I have to finish I'm like you have to finish that whole that whole and you pretty much have to fit if there's a flag on your map you have to finish all the flags is what it is that flight was bothering me for however many many months or weeks yeah you need to get to the part at the very end when he decides he's going to be a professor because that's what he really wants to do the vespiquen match yes was awesome it was everything I haven't come across that yet it's a it's a very it's a very big surprise what happens that I was not sure what the mechanics were when I got in there it's kind of like you ever play when you played red and blue for the first time then you get to cerulean city and you're like I just want to explore the town real quick and you like walk up a little bit and then your rival shows up and he's like oh we're battling and you're like no I just walked into the town that's what the vespiquen part reminded me of and it's not like I lost it the first time because I literally had one cub fool but you know if you had like a talonflame or something it's relatively easy and I always when people are always like I want Pokemon games be hard I feel like people remember that moment or like the moment where you get to the end of the SSN and you're like I just want to see what's down this hallway and then your rival pops up and it's not it's not because it's hard it's just there are these unexpected instances where you're not prepared and that's what actually like screws you over and not specifically because like you suddenly forgot how to battle it's just like oh I just wanted to see what's down this hallway and now I'm stuck in this battle and all I got is a level 30 red and sad that's yeah half health and I lose we cuz of that I will say that you know I actually know that I'm thinking back to where I am in the game that that what was super frustrating for me was I walked up to the town and the woman said you can only have cup foo in your party and so I took all the Pokemon out of my party and saved and is like okay I'm ready and then I walked up again and she's like and make sure cup foo is level seven she said that first I would have walked away and taking care of things and not spent all that time getting all the pokemons out of my party the game does though it's smart enough to know that you couldn't ever stone on the cup foo so when I finished mustard and he's like go evolve your cup food now and then I like touch it he goes oh I see you have a never stone on your cup foo I guess you want to spend more time with Cub Foods so that's fine feel free to leave come back when you're ready it was a really nice touch that they like engaged but you couldn't go back and do the other tower still right no no no no I know that choice is made it's made yeah I know they opened up there's like sparring or something that opens up when you're done done but I don't know what that is this restrictive battling yeah which is like behind the dojo not in the tower yeah I really thought they were gonna use the towers for something else but I guess they didn't yeah no no restrictive sparring not battling same thing yeah I thought I thought they would you know once you've finished the towers they were gonna use them for like some battle tower thing where you gotta go up with one Pokemon or something and that was a little bit of a letdown yeah I'm gonna try restrictive sparring at one point I just just have to figure out what type I wanna try first berry maybe alright let's get through this news real quick Pokemon masters full disclosure I'm partnered with DNA they added eggs to the game this is off their website you can receive eggs from Professor Bellis when completing areas of the main story or training areas that have featured battles Pokemon you can hatch have eggs have different roles and passive skills than other Pokemon on the same species so currently right now you can hash Poros female Meowth be Bellsprout female knitter an male Zubat and male Rattata they said other genders will appear in future eggs and tauros is allowed to be shiny edits new items you can buy so you you get a default egg box and you get a default incubator this may sound familiar from oh come on go and then there's a daycare so when you hatch an egg it will go to the daycare and then in the daycare you can select it to be your partner Pokemon there's also an egg research ticket the which will let you like auto hatch stuff but I don't know Greg if you've done any of the eggs I have done none of the eggs I have looked at the egg update but I haven't like here's my problem none none of the pokemon that are currently hatch Abul from the eggs excite me in any way so I'm like oh okay I'll get to it yeah so there's no walking like Pokemon go and they're there they do a thing where this this is kind of a complaint we've had the the real money verse the the gems or the real the money gems versus the free gems I guess which I just wish there was two different currencies I wish absolutely I just wish one was like gems and one was diamonds or something I don't know just I don't like the little tiny text that says like the paid you can so you can only do egg stuff with real money you can so your egg box can hold four eggs think of this like in Pokemon go where you can hold nine you can spend a hundred and eighty gems which is what like two bucks to expand it to hold eight and then you get one free incubator just like in Pokemon go and you can expiry the incubator is permanent though unlike Pokemon go to dollar incubator in Pokemon go I think last three times and then a bricks this incubator is permanent but you can only buy the egg upgrade box and the incubator with paid gems and this is what got me to actually spend money and this game cool but I am AI am always a sucker for permanent things you're gonna tell me my egg a box is permanently upgraded and I'm permanently with an incubator I'm into that so I ended up spending uh ten dollars in in pokemon or Pokemon masters I have two egg incubators this is pretty much how it works there's a 20% chance when you do a battle in the story or like a training battle that an egg drops they drop into your egg box there's either one star 2 star 3 star eggs they all have the same Pokemon I listed below above or in this episode and then you can pick which egg you want to put in the incubator just like Pokemon go and then a 12-hour countdown starts and then you have to do 3 of any battle to get it to hatch so if you just wait the 12 hours it doesn't hatch you got to do 12 hours plus 3 battles and that's it and if you put 2 eggs in an incubator and you do 3 battles it'll apply to both relatively easy and simple you just gotta wait 12 hours and I've hatched so far on it I ran or a tatse a meow to tauros and a Bellsprout there's no walking there's no jumping through hoops you just get your eggs you put them in you wait 12 hours you're good to go and the last thing you can buy which I didn't is an accelerator pass and that's 500 gems and it says that it adds an additional limit it all adds a limited-time incubator so this one will break it will only last 14 days when all your incubators are in use you can select up to 4 eggs from your box and it will Auto it will just Auto incubate them so you don't have to like wake you don't have to like send an alarm for 12 hours wake up put more eggs and move on so that's more of like an automated thing which we've seen in other games I think clash Royale clash Royale had that where you could manually open one chest at a time but if you bought the season pass you we would like queue up a chest for you so I did not purchase that because it was not permanent I have had a couple people say they fell off masters the egg stuff brought them back they thought the egg stuff was fun and doesn't seem very money grabby I mean they can't take any more of my money I gave them the $5 to get the first incubator and the $2 to get the thing there's there's no more money for them to take from me so a place that now you oh yeah I'm sure they'll sell more if they sell more permanent incubators I'd probably buy them but I don't know what the plan is in the future like they have what six Pokemon in incubators right now or in eggs right now do they add more to that do they just swap out all six I think it would probably be more exciting if they swap out all six I would rather have a smaller pool knowing what I'm getting and then the other thing is data miners determined that the chance for shiny tauros is 1% give or take like one point one seven or point nine seven because I think it's like point nine seven in one star and then it's at one point one seven and three star so one had a hundred chance for a shiny pokemon I don't think it's awful I mean even that's not bad at all bad even if you don't pay any money you can do two eggs a day that I don't think that's bad I think it's pretty good have you played with any of the eggs eh like how is the partnering system do your moves changed your moves change with the Pokemon like are there different skills to buy with Taurus than with yes so one of my tauros is no blizzard and then another Toro snows like Thunderbolts so they do hatch with different moves and different abilities and I've the shiny one is locked to a like really good move set what I've been told so the one Taurus I have is a support and then the other Taurus I have is the what's exclamation mark Lakes strike not striker but like tech tackle yeah and then the shiny one can only be a striker which is the best for Taurus according to people who play the game way more than I do yeah I'm a little worried about like the more eggs that come in and the more like the mortar it you know it's still it it is still a way to feed into the grind of now that I've got this Taurus that I want that shiny now I have to go through the same grind to get all the things to level this pair up I'm also feeling a little weird about when they start doubling up with Pokemon that other sync pairs already have wait does somebody have Taurus currently no but there's going to come a point when that happens and so just thinking down the future of how that's gonna be managed or if they're just never going to you know they're only gonna live it - eggs - Pokemon that other don't have even though they've already done that with Charizard and stuff yeah I mean I would I would hope that the eggs just stick to Pokemon that may be somebody's favorite but you know a gym leader doesn't end abusing I hope so I'm just curious how it's gonna play out in the future I just also hope that this 1% doesn't get dramatically dropped to like point zero zero zero three percent as they add more Pokemon because I think one percent is is good like one percent is exciting to hatch eggs and I don't think DNA came out and said like hey these are the odds but because the data miners were like you know you have a you have a five percent chance of getting Toros one percent chance of that being shiny or like 5 plus 1 is 6 and then like 30% chance for attacks of 20% chance for like we know what they are and I like when loot boxes show that transparency and I think that's why I'm so frustrated with Pokemon go eggs and I've been frustrated with Pokemon go it's like uh well you know they said fossils are in here but I keep getting interests I've heard they're supposed to be our dactyls in these and I get it like the self road like they'll you know find a thousand people they'll calculate the odds but just just tell us just just what a mystery the mystery all right this podcast is going on too long there's a bug-out event yeah ok there's much weird thing they cancelled pincer raid day yeah June 24th Pokemon go live.com trainers the following events have been canceled postponed or change pincer raid a this event has been canceled be sure to follow social media to stay up to date that's

a worldwide game so yeah but they also aren't gonna be like America you are bad so we've cancelled it for you because that is just that is just PR they do that the PR headache they do not need but why don't they just say we're canceling it because of kovat that's what they've they've done this they said hey we're not doing Wednesday nitrides because of the current economic conditions like I don't

this week's Pokemon I'm protonated in this week so it's chata know I'm not quite this Pokemon one of the most forgettable Pokemon was only ever available in the world between April 16 2016 and through February 28th 2017 we originally discovered it as part of a data miner leak in 2014 so we're really surprised when it finally appeared over two years later it is the last pokemon in the central Kalos pokedex even though it was distributed when the Hoenn region was the primary region and one month before we all started exploring the Lola there you go so forgettable you've already already forgotten what it is that is our show I don't know forgetting any breaking Pokemon news the next week hopefully man they handle this rollercoaster of emotion next week we have some Pokemon Go news regarding what they plan out for July the lead-up to Pokemon go fast they're doing some stuff for that we'll be talking about are I think by then all three of us will have played enough cafe mix I've only heard positive things about cafe mix alright it's pretty fine I've been having come with it yeah it's our just super cute so we will talk about that next week I made an app record guide so if you're looking at how the scam o matic works that is on Twitter in it if you are curious about some of the walking animations I made a really good walking animation video on YouTube I'm working on trying to make a max mushroom guide right now on YouTube because the stereotypical answer is do three max raids and max mushrooms will appear and that's not the case and so I just want to clear up any confusion can you have more than one spawn can you keep doing raids what kind of raids count how many Ray's do you got to do where are they located so I'm gonna try to do some of that there should actually be a YouTube video of everything you can do daily and sword and shield that we'll be putting up so trying to just make more helpful guides and content most of my life on Twitch is answering questions so I
