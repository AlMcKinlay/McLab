and will is here i (0:44 - 0:49)
the opposite of everything greg just (0:48 - 0:52)
said why are you so (0:49 - 0:55)
confrontational because positive energy (0:52 - 0:57)
towards 469 dude (0:55 - 1:00)
i only got like (0:57 - 1:02)
11 hours of sleep and that's a lot of (1:00 - 1:03)
sleep (1:02 - 1:06)
not enough not enough how many how many (1:03 - 1:10)
hours of sleep do you need 20 (1:06 - 1:12)
20. that's most of them i'm just like a (1:10 - 1:14)
cat i'm awake for four hours i'm alert (1:12 - 1:16)
for four hours and the other 20 i need (1:14 - 1:18)
to be in full rest (1:16 - 1:20)
that sounds like a good life it is it's (1:18 - 1:23)
a good life if you can get it (1:20 - 1:26)
uh this is the week before go fest so (1:23 - 1:27)
with that being said there's a lot of (1:26 - 1:29)
gofest news (1:27 - 1:32)
and so we're going to cover that and (1:29 - 1:35)
i'm out of town next week and my thought (1:32 - 1:36)
process was (1:35 - 1:38)
let's just record two episodes today but (1:36 - 1:40)
i know the second we do that there's (1:38 - 1:43)
going to be a bunch of news this week (1:40 - 1:46)
so we'll play next week's episode i mean (1:43 - 1:47)
there will be an episode next week (1:46 - 1:50)
split this episode into two (1:47 - 1:54)
i thought about that too we'll go five (1:50 - 1:54)
hours (1:54 - 1:57)
and you get two no no no no no no we go (1:54 - 1:59)
the standard 90 minutes and they get two (1:57 - 2:02)
45-minute episodes i've got sleep (1:59 - 2:04)
if we went for five hours i definitely (2:02 - 2:07)
wouldn't get enough sleep (2:04 - 2:10)
the question is are they (2:07 - 2:12)
way too early for question of the week (2:10 - 2:13)
yeah (2:12 - 2:15)
but like we knowing unite is coming this (2:13 - 2:16)
month (2:15 - 2:18)
yep we don't we don't have a date yet (2:16 - 2:20)
nope it better not be next weekend (2:18 - 2:24)
because it is cinno month based on their (2:20 - 2:27)
plushies slash tcg card slash (2:24 - 2:31)
twitter slash badoof (2:27 - 2:33)
you would think that this would be the (2:31 - 2:34)
month they (2:33 - 2:37)
announced more details for the remakes (2:34 - 2:40)
but you know they've done weirder things (2:37 - 2:41)
like (2:40 - 2:43)
like nothing at all nothing they've done (2:41 - 2:45)
weirder things like ignoring that this (2:43 - 2:47)
is the 25th anniversary (2:45 - 2:49)
hey we have an audio collaboration (2:47 - 2:50)

uncle recently (3:08 - 3:12)

that could be bad could be exactly (3:14 - 3:20)
you know what you know what like and (3:18 - 3:21)
it's like that heat wave in the pacific (3:20 - 3:23)
northwest and everything this (3:21 - 3:25)
all sounds like a pokemon game yeah (3:23 - 3:26)
right some (3:25 - 3:31)

speaking of heating up (3:38 - 3:42)
[Music] (3:40 - 3:45)
the first bit of news was gigantomax (3:42 - 3:46)
charizard (3:45 - 3:49)
copper raja and more in max raid battles (3:46 - 3:50)
that's happening this (3:49 - 3:52)
that happened this weekend you missed it (3:50 - 3:54)
if you're listening on monday (3:52 - 3:57)
it's gone that's true uh so they they (3:54 - 4:00)
for anyone who don't doesn't know why (3:57 - 4:02)
these pokemon were picked or maybe they (4:00 - 4:03)
just didn't know there was an event this (4:02 - 4:04)
weekend (4:03 - 4:05)
uh there's a reason why we're bringing (4:04 - 4:07)
this up number one is (4:05 - 4:09)
because they're doing an event because (4:07 - 4:11)
they did an event this past weekend (4:09 - 4:13)
you would think that they're not going (4:11 - 4:14)
to announce you an event (4:13 - 4:17)
over go festive weekend but they've done (4:14 - 4:17)
two (4:17 - 4:20)
events in a row before you would be (4:17 - 4:23)
wrong but uh the reason that it's (4:20 - 4:25)
coughing lava fat military (4:23 - 4:27)
copper raja and charizard is because (4:25 - 4:29)
that's the cooking metals (4:27 - 4:32)
that you get coughing being the worst (4:29 - 4:34)
charizard being the best (4:32 - 4:37)
um but they promoted a shiny (4:34 - 4:40)
copper raja this event uh and it was the (4:37 - 4:40)
first time (4:40 - 4:43)
ever that you could get the opposite (4:40 - 4:48)
food 10 in your game which was a (4:43 - 4:50)
version exclusive and you would have to (4:48 - 4:52)
like attach the food tin to a pokemon (4:50 - 4:54)
and then trade the pokemon over (4:52 - 4:56)
that's how you would get it and you need (4:54 - 4:58)
all 151 different (4:56 - 5:02)
tins or not tins but meals (4:58 - 5:04)
uh in order to get the golden ladle and (5:02 - 5:06)
the golden fan (5:04 - 5:08)
so when you're cooking you can really (5:06 - 5:11)
show off to you (5:08 - 5:13)
look none other than the other people (5:11 - 5:15)
you're cooking with yeah nobody can (5:13 - 5:18)
find my camp much like the (5:15 - 5:20)
uh sit there and scream at steve i'm (5:18 - 5:22)
next to the tree (5:20 - 5:25)
and will steve ever find me no (5:22 - 5:28)
it's the same people buying the pokemon (5:25 - 5:29)
grill set (5:28 - 5:32)
valid yeah you always got to just set up (5:29 - 5:33)
camp in the (5:32 - 5:35)
best places like directly in front of (5:33 - 5:37)
the daycare or (5:35 - 5:39)
do you know how many people are in front (5:37 - 5:41)
of the daycare in that campsite there's (5:39 - 5:42)
like 50. (5:41 - 5:47)
i know that's that's the go-to place (5:42 - 5:47)
i think it's cool that (5:47 - 5:53)
i i would i would bet (5:50 - 5:56)
maybe that there was some sort of a game (5:53 - 5:57)
plan with these (5:56 - 6:01)
rollouts of raids (5:57 - 6:04)
like i don't think that like somebody (6:01 - 6:05)
i can't imagine there's somebody at game (6:04 - 6:07)
freak being like what do you want to do (6:05 - 6:09)
for a raid event this month and being (6:07 - 6:09)
like (6:09 - 6:12)
you know no one has that bach foot in (6:09 - 6:13)
yet let's put what (6:12 - 6:15)
like i feel like this is eventually part (6:13 - 6:17)
of like the things we can do (6:15 - 6:18)
i mean i think you're giving them a lot (6:17 - 6:20)
of credit but sure (6:18 - 6:23)
there has to be like one person i'm sure (6:20 - 6:24)
there is one person (6:23 - 6:27)
saying there's one person that's trying (6:24 - 6:29)
to manage the google calendar (6:27 - 6:33)
where they come up and say okay susan (6:29 - 6:35)
what's this what's what's happening this (6:33 - 6:36)
week and she's like (6:35 - 6:39)
i don't i don't i don't just do a food (6:36 - 6:40)
thing (6:39 - 6:43)
i don't know you pay me a dollar 75 an (6:40 - 6:44)
hour i'm an (6:43 - 6:47)
intern that's that's really what it is (6:44 - 6:48)
right there wait (6:47 - 6:50)
oh real question does japan have interns (6:48 - 6:52)
or is that an america thing (6:50 - 6:54)
everywhere has your turn every (6:52 - 6:56)
corporation that can get you to work for (6:54 - 6:57)
free (6:56 - 7:00)
and college experience has it (6:57 - 7:04)
it's a bad practice and it should end (7:00 - 7:05)
hey have you been around since the (7:04 - 7:07)
middle ages or medieval times it's (7:05 - 7:10)
called an apprenticeship (7:07 - 7:13)
your family sold you to the blacksmith (7:10 - 7:13)
as his (7:13 - 7:15)
apprentice apprentice and then you maybe (7:13 - 7:17)
started your own business if you didn't (7:15 - 7:18)
die of (7:17 - 7:21)
fever shiny chances aside (7:18 - 7:24)
yes i would (7:21 - 7:28)
say that sword and shield has been (7:24 - 7:31)
one of the easily the best pokemon game (7:28 - 7:34)
when it comes to a person who has no (7:31 - 7:35)
friends (7:34 - 7:38)
oh yeah yeah because in order to get all (7:35 - 7:40)
the pokemon in order to complete your (7:38 - 7:43)
curry decks in order to get whatever (7:40 - 7:46)
xyz not those games you always needed to (7:43 - 7:47)
trade (7:46 - 7:48)
and this has been a thing since red and (7:47 - 7:50)
blue and (7:48 - 7:52)
because of these raid events of mixing (7:50 - 7:55)
and matching because of the rotation (7:52 - 7:58)
of raids they have pretty much (7:55 - 8:00)
made it where like the only thing i (7:58 - 8:01)
think that you would actually need to (8:00 - 8:03)
trade for would be a legend at this (8:01 - 8:04)
point (8:03 - 8:07)
yeah but like yeah the thing ponyta (8:04 - 8:08)
farfetch (8:07 - 8:11)
all of these version exclusives have i (8:08 - 8:14)
think all been in raids up to this point (8:11 - 8:14)
yes i think so yeah it's been very loner (8:15 - 8:23)
friendly it's a very loner-friendly game (8:20 - 8:27)
it takes the the isolationist (8:23 - 8:30)
uh heart of the united kingdom and has (8:27 - 8:33)
embraced it fully (8:30 - 8:33)
was a reference to last week yes also (8:34 - 8:39)
did you get your shiny elephant (8:36 - 8:41)
no i i i was playing go all weekend so (8:39 - 8:42)
i'll (8:41 - 8:46)
have some time today hopefully i did (8:42 - 8:48)
i got it i found one damn i caught it in (8:46 - 8:50)
a repeat ball and i'm like (8:48 - 8:53)
and i'm done you know i think copperaja (8:50 - 8:56)
looks good in a safari ball (8:53 - 8:59)
uh if i found my own (8:56 - 9:01)
den i would have done that but since i (8:59 - 9:03)
was in somebody else's (9:01 - 9:06)
repeat ball away (9:03 - 9:06)
this is also off pokemon.com the 25th (9:06 - 9:11)

in double elimination bracket as they (9:39 - 9:44)
seek to prove who's the true champion (9:41 - 9:46)
you admit this is the thing where they (9:44 - 9:47)
said that (9:46 - 9:49)
i still think at the end of the day this (9:47 - 9:51)
is a little weird because all they're (9:49 - 9:52)
doing is they're taking the top eight (9:51 - 9:55)
from players cup four (9:52 - 9:55)
which they didn't say until after (9:56 - 9:59)
players cup (9:58 - 10:02)
four was on its way so like if you were (9:59 - 10:04)
like i'll just wait for players cup five (10:02 - 10:06)
or you know i'm not into player skip (10:04 - 10:08)
four and then they're like we're doing (10:06 - 10:09)
this invitational and you're like (10:08 - 10:11)

there's been four player cups wouldn't (10:18 - 10:22)
you want to take the like top (10:20 - 10:25)
four players from each of them i mean (10:22 - 10:28)
right yeah strangely it doesn't matter (10:25 - 10:29)
what i would want to do (10:28 - 10:31)
it's the person who made the decision (10:29 - 10:33)
who actually matters (10:31 - 10:37)
yep i mean i'm excited that my (10:33 - 10:40)

wreck house uh steve claims that he beat (10:47 - 10:51)
me once and that is (10:50 - 10:53)
vastly incorrect i thought wolf skip (10:51 - 10:55)
players got before (10:53 - 10:58)
you think that but i'm here dude no i i (10:55 - 10:59)
thought (10:58 - 11:00)

yeah well this is scientific twitter (14:40 - 14:45)
research this i mean (14:43 - 14:48)
okay this is not scientific this is (14:45 - 14:50)
twitter research can we leave the (14:48 - 14:51)
scientific (14:50 - 14:54)
off of this thank you uh (14:51 - 14:59)
so 6.8 percent we'll just say seven (14:54 - 15:01)
percent said they basically one hundred (14:59 - 15:02)
percent (15:01 - 15:05)
um what how what do you define 100 (15:02 - 15:06)
percent (15:05 - 15:12)
like every every photo (15:06 - 15:12)
i don't know all all stars all photos (15:12 - 15:18)
all all stars all photos but not all (15:16 - 15:20)
four star (15:18 - 15:23)
not all four star stars just all photos (15:20 - 15:27)
no 100 is all stars all photos (15:23 - 15:32)
yeah oh yeah yeah but not like four star (15:27 - 15:36)
on all but you can get a four star (15:32 - 15:39)
diamond rank diamond rank all photos (15:36 - 15:42)
diamond rank everything yes not diamond (15:39 - 15:43)
rank no (15:42 - 15:45)
yeah you have to get a one star two star (15:43 - 15:47)
three star and a four star for (15:45 - 15:49)
every pokemon yes yes that's what i (15:47 - 15:50)
would say 100 (15:49 - 15:52)
is well then you're weak and that's not (15:50 - 15:54)
100 (15:52 - 15:57)
uh beat story plus extra stuff so that's (15:54 - 16:01)
16.2 um (15:57 - 16:05)
beat the main story uh 19 (16:01 - 16:11)
and then didn't finish it 58 (16:05 - 16:11)
cheers good job we're that's where will (16:11 - 16:15)
is (16:14 - 16:17)
so i would say finish it would be i'm (16:15 - 16:19)
still on meganium (16:17 - 16:20)
i would say finish it would just be (16:19 - 16:22)
getting credits right because that's the (16:20 - 16:23)
next option (16:22 - 16:25)
like beat the main story would be (16:23 - 16:26)
getting credits (16:25 - 16:28)
oh yeah that's the main story so if (16:26 - 16:30)
you're looking at that that means you (16:28 - 16:31)
did not get (16:30 - 16:34)
you did not get the credits you did not (16:31 - 16:35)
complete the story (16:34 - 16:38)
one out of five people (16:35 - 16:38)
got credits when they bought the game (16:38 - 16:44)
according to twitter according like i (16:42 - 16:45)
said i think 5 000 people is a (16:44 - 16:48)
pretty pretty good sample size um it is (16:45 - 16:51)
i think i mean it is (16:48 - 16:55)
yeah twitter who also fought like (16:51 - 16:58)
it is a very specific audience so you (16:55 - 16:59)
cannot say that it (16:58 - 17:02)
is representative of the larger pokemon (16:59 - 17:03)
snap (17:02 - 17:06)
community because you are only getting (17:03 - 17:06)
20 (17:06 - 17:08)
of those people who actually use twitter (17:06 - 17:10)
and then a subset of them who actually (17:08 - 17:12)
follow jaywits (17:10 - 17:14)
and then a subset of them who actually (17:12 - 17:15)
bothered to take (17:14 - 17:19)
the survey true it is not (17:15 - 17:23)
representative it is indicative of what (17:19 - 17:25)
possible trends don't use big words we (17:23 - 17:27)
can't say that it is representative (17:25 - 17:30)
of the larger community we can attempt (17:27 - 17:31)
to draw conclusions (17:30 - 17:34)
from the data provided understanding (17:31 - 17:35)
that the data is (17:34 - 17:39)
not a pure controlled representative (17:35 - 17:40)
sample (17:39 - 17:42)
of people who bought pokemon snap but (17:40 - 17:43)
you're never going to get that with any (17:42 - 17:44)
survey (17:43 - 17:46)
well you are from a company was this (17:44 - 17:47)
approved by (17:46 - 17:51)
the irb even even okay so what i don't (17:47 - 17:53)
ever get about these like polls (17:51 - 17:55)
is they'll be like we went out and we we (17:53 - 17:57)
found out that like (17:55 - 17:59)
seven out of eight people like their (17:57 - 18:01)
iphone and it's like who did you (17:59 - 18:04)
i hate my iphone (18:01 - 18:04)
i mean so we can turn this into (18:05 - 18:10)
statistics (18:08 - 18:13)
this is where margin of error comes in (18:10 - 18:15)
so like you you'll always have to look (18:13 - 18:17)
at what the margin of error is which is (18:15 - 18:17)
what they were (18:17 - 18:21)
trying to control for saying uh we took (18:17 - 18:24)
random samples so they took (18:21 - 18:26)
phone book or however they picked their (18:24 - 18:28)
samples or they went out on the street (18:26 - 18:30)
into a specific location (18:28 - 18:33)
so that you aren't focusing your (18:30 - 18:35)
audience you're trying to keep it (18:33 - 18:37)
as random as possible but then you still (18:35 - 18:39)
have to build in a margin of error (18:37 - 18:39)
saying (18:39 - 18:42)
we could not control for these factors (18:39 - 18:45)
so the data may be skewed because it's (18:42 - 18:47)
more likely that iphone users will (18:45 - 18:48)
answer an (18:47 - 18:50)
iphone poll and iphone users are more (18:48 - 18:52)
likely to say yes (18:50 - 18:55)
depending on how you pull those people (18:52 - 18:58)
yeah no i understand that (18:55 - 19:03)
i feel like the best range of (18:58 - 19:05)
did like did you finish it or whatever (19:03 - 19:08)
is like the playstation trophies (19:05 - 19:09)
because those are actual people who (19:08 - 19:11)
bought the game yes (19:09 - 19:13)
because that's how they got the truth (19:11 - 19:15)
but there's no other filter (19:13 - 19:18)
right it's reportable based on solely (19:15 - 19:20)
what is reported to playstation (19:18 - 19:23)
right like nintendo knows for sure (19:20 - 19:23)
because (19:23 - 19:25)
it's connected to the internet and they (19:23 - 19:27)
can see i don't (19:25 - 19:30)
know because monster hunter stories too (19:27 - 19:32)
had a legit thing that you had to agree (19:30 - 19:34)
to that says (19:32 - 19:36)
is it okay if we monitor your gameplay (19:34 - 19:39)
experience and take reports let us know (19:36 - 19:40)
if that's not okay and it had a little (19:39 - 19:42)
checkbox that you had to sign off and (19:40 - 19:43)
say (19:42 - 19:46)
yes i agree for capcom to get my (19:43 - 19:47)
information i never seen that for (19:46 - 19:48)
anything (19:47 - 19:51)
in pokemon and if one company is doing (19:48 - 19:53)
it all companies need to be doing it (19:51 - 19:56)
need to be aren't but need to be i can (19:53 - 19:57)
tell you that much (19:56 - 20:01)
[Laughter] (19:57 - 20:02)
yeah i mean every time you connect to (20:01 - 20:04)
the internet in pogo or (20:02 - 20:06)
in pokemon certain shield they they have (20:04 - 20:08)
to know like okay this player (20:06 - 20:11)
has caught you know 70 000 pokemon (20:08 - 20:15)
yeah and on average a player catches (20:11 - 20:19)
five pokemon this guy's the exception (20:15 - 20:21)
i mean the thing is is most of most (20:19 - 20:22)
companies are not (20:21 - 20:25)
tying your you to your data usually they (20:22 - 20:26)
will only say (20:25 - 20:28)
hey can we collect it is they're going (20:26 - 20:30)
to tie it to your data (20:28 - 20:33)
so nintendo can collect averages from (20:30 - 20:37)
user data where your specific name (20:33 - 20:40)
and id have been stripped from it to get (20:37 - 20:40)
signed posts (20:40 - 20:42)
of how their game is doing all right (20:40 - 20:45)
draw your conclusions off this clearly (20:42 - 20:48)
uh biased poll i don't think it's bias (20:45 - 20:49)
it's not like it's not like (20:48 - 20:50)
the it's not like j wits is like a (20:49 - 20:52)
pokemon dude i would say he's like a (20:50 - 20:53)
nintendo dude (20:52 - 20:55)
i wouldn't say he's a pokemon dude i (20:53 - 20:57)
would think if anyone put up a poll (20:55 - 21:00)
that i think his is more his is (20:57 - 21:04)
less bias i guess (21:00 - 21:05)
maybe there should have been an option (21:04 - 21:07)
of like i didn't play it yeah (21:05 - 21:10)
uh but i think 20 of people beating the (21:07 - 21:12)
game i think that's higher than i would (21:10 - 21:13)
expect (21:12 - 21:14)
again going back to those playstation (21:13 - 21:17)
polls you'll see like destiny or (21:14 - 21:19)
something and they'll be like oh fifty (21:17 - 21:21)
percent of you didn't even get the first (21:19 - 21:21)
like (21:21 - 21:23)
boss done like what why did you even (21:21 - 21:25)
spend sixty dollars on those games i (21:23 - 21:25)
mean (21:25 - 21:27)
overwatch i think it's i think it's (21:25 - 21:30)
pretty easy to (21:27 - 21:32)
get through the game like you could get (21:30 - 21:34)
to credits in 12 hours if you (21:32 - 21:37)
didn't yeah you do a bunch of stuff so (21:34 - 21:38)
there's a lot (21:37 - 21:40)
to hold somebody's attention though i (21:38 - 21:41)
mean like if if (21:40 - 21:43)
if you're really pretty like oh the game (21:41 - 21:44)
is fun but it's not amazing (21:43 - 21:46)
like man 12 you're asking a lot for 12 (21:44 - 21:49)
hours (21:46 - 21:49)
okay i think so right (21:49 - 21:55)
it's like it's like a weekend (21:52 - 21:58)
yeah but that's dedicated right if (21:55 - 21:59)
you're just gonna sit there for 12 who (21:58 - 22:01)
has 12 hours to sit there straight (21:59 - 22:02)
that's like four aw (22:01 - 22:05)
wait three awake periods for me (22:02 - 22:08)
think of it this way though like i want (22:05 - 22:11)
to get back into final fantasy (22:08 - 22:13)
and they have the free 14-day login (22:11 - 22:16)
right now which is like perfect timing (22:13 - 22:19)
i also have a code but (22:16 - 22:22)
like like i this is how i feel like (22:19 - 22:24)
people feel when they they play games (22:22 - 22:25)
like (22:24 - 22:28)
it almost feels like a chore (22:25 - 22:30)
where you're like i gotta log in i gotta (22:28 - 22:32)
figure out where i was (22:30 - 22:35)
what am i doing next where instead (22:32 - 22:38)
and this is what i always tell people or (22:35 - 22:39)
at least how i think (22:38 - 22:43)
like when when i was a kid or even (22:39 - 22:46)
when i was late early 20s (22:43 - 22:48)
like i felt like we didn't have that (22:46 - 22:50)
many options for video games (22:48 - 22:51)
so when somebody was like oh this video (22:50 - 22:53)
game's like 40 hours long you're like (22:51 - 22:54)
heck yeah (22:53 - 22:57)
because either one one i can't afford (22:54 - 22:59)
a new game so i'm gonna get the most (22:57 - 23:01)
value out of this game (22:59 - 23:02)
or two games aren't coming out fast (23:01 - 23:05)
enough whereas in this day and age with (23:02 - 23:07)
so many free to play games (23:05 - 23:10)
so many discounted games on steam um (23:07 - 23:13)
so okay i feel like if your game doesn't (23:10 - 23:17)
ha if your game isn't solid 12 hours (23:13 - 23:19)
is asking a lot where you just go i can (23:17 - 23:20)
go back to pokemon snap (23:19 - 23:22)
or i can go back to apex because it's (23:20 - 23:24)
easy to jump in or i (23:22 - 23:25)
disagree with the fact that there were (23:24 - 23:28)
fewer games back then (23:25 - 23:31)
because you were talking for you what (23:28 - 23:34)
2000's okay when i was like 20 the only (23:31 - 23:34)
like (23:34 - 23:38)
game on iphone was like doodle jump (23:34 - 23:40)
and cut the rope the episode didn't (23:38 - 23:41)
exist until (23:40 - 23:45)
2007. but there were a lot of (23:41 - 23:48)
other there were a lot of games (23:45 - 23:50)
there were i mean there were they we (23:48 - 23:52)
need a survey how many games are there (23:50 - 23:54)
now compared to that (23:52 - 23:55)
i mean there were three there were the (23:54 - 23:57)
three game systems were all (23:55 - 24:00)
running full for plus pc (23:57 - 24:02)
yeah that i think landscape hasn't (24:00 - 24:04)
changed that has is there are a lot (24:02 - 24:08)
more free to play games yes smartphones (24:04 - 24:11)
have radically altered the game (24:08 - 24:14)
landscape so you have a fifth contender (24:11 - 24:15)
now (24:14 - 24:18)
but i don't think that that made (24:15 - 24:22)
the decisions to put time into a game (24:18 - 24:22)
any less 20 years ago you just (24:23 - 24:29)
the barrier of entry was you had to pay (24:26 - 24:32)
for a game and decided it was worth it (24:29 - 24:34)
given that there were still free-to-play (24:32 - 24:36)
games on pcs (24:34 - 24:38)
such as the ones that are people who (24:36 - 24:39)
played (24:38 - 24:42)
minecraft for thousands of hours (24:39 - 24:44)
there are people who played solitaire (24:42 - 24:47)
that came on their computer (24:44 - 24:50)
for thousands of hours pc pinball game (24:47 - 24:51)
that game was rad too (24:50 - 24:53)
mine sweeper wasn't that one that (24:51 - 24:55)
everybody played (24:53 - 24:57)
uh there was snake on your old phones i (24:55 - 24:58)
mean (24:57 - 25:01)
there were things always to distract you (24:58 - 25:01)
i (25:01 - 25:05)
i think it's got more competitive (25:01 - 25:08)
now because there are way many more (25:05 - 25:08)
cheaper (25:08 - 25:11)
options and we have a lot of living (25:08 - 25:12)
games now (25:11 - 25:15)
compared to 2007 (25:12 - 25:16)
[Laughter] (25:15 - 25:20)
i mean mmos took off right like that (25:16 - 25:24)
these games keep updating um (25:20 - 25:26)
when they sort of realize that they can (25:24 - 25:27)
make more money (25:26 - 25:30)
through a subscription model than making (25:27 - 25:32)
you make a one-time purchase (25:30 - 25:35)
games with season passes that became the (25:32 - 25:35)
new (25:35 - 25:38)
norm uh and that i think that was a (25:35 - 25:39)
result of phones (25:38 - 25:42)
because a phone will always keep you (25:39 - 25:43)
interested and updated there's always (25:42 - 25:45)
something new you can download so (25:43 - 25:48)
they just met that model yeah um in by (25:45 - 25:50)
no means do i think pokemon snap is bad (25:48 - 25:51)
i think (25:50 - 25:54)
it is yeah absolutely phenomenal (25:51 - 25:54)
incredible (25:54 - 25:57)
worth 60 dollars so glad i was wrong on (25:54 - 25:58)
it (25:57 - 26:02)
um the fact that i (25:58 - 26:05)
ended up putting 80 hours into that game (26:02 - 26:08)
still 200 pictures short of having like (26:05 - 26:09)
all the pictures (26:08 - 26:12)
because it's what like 140 times 4 or (26:09 - 26:14)
something like that (26:12 - 26:18)
140. how many pokemon in that game 214. (26:14 - 26:20)
oh yeah (26:18 - 26:20)
so it's 214 times 4. yeah so that's what (26:21 - 26:26)
like 800 photos total (26:25 - 26:30)
yeah i'm about 200 shy (26:26 - 26:32)
so i think it's absolutely incredible (26:30 - 26:33)
i'm not surprised that at least (26:32 - 26:34)
according to the 56 (26:33 - 26:37)
856 at least according to this twitter (26:34 - 26:37)
poll (26:37 - 26:41)
that like 20 of people (26:37 - 26:44)
seeing credits that makes sense to me (26:41 - 26:48)
um a bunch of people finishing it (26:44 - 26:48)
yeah i guess i want to go back to your (26:49 - 26:53)
final fantasy don't know where to get in (26:51 - 26:55)
they have fixed that issue there's a (26:53 - 26:56)
thing (26:55 - 26:58)
up in the corner that tells you your (26:56 - 26:59)
main story line (26:58 - 27:00)
where you are in the middle yeah yeah (26:59 - 27:02)
yeah yeah no i was playing the game when (27:00 - 27:04)
it did that (27:02 - 27:07)
it's easy to jump back in it tells you (27:04 - 27:10)
it says hey this is where you were (27:07 - 27:10)
what was your 14 free days till till (27:11 - 27:16)
like august or something (27:13 - 27:18)
well i mean so if you get if you (27:16 - 27:19)
download the game you can play (27:18 - 27:22)
up to level 60 for free yeah i'm already (27:19 - 27:24)
whatever i'm like 65 or whatever right (27:22 - 27:26)
because i remember when the level cap (27:24 - 27:29)
was 70 and i was like just shy of that (27:26 - 27:31)
there's a lot of learning fun the the (27:29 - 27:34)
barrier of final fantasy so high it's (27:31 - 27:35)
not (27:34 - 27:39)
it is really low for a mmo (27:35 - 27:42)
it's really streamlined (27:39 - 27:44)
look i got place i gotta play stories (27:42 - 27:47)
this week at least a little bit (27:44 - 27:51)
okay some sometime unite is coming (27:47 - 27:53)
right we'll we'll try to make it all (27:51 - 27:55)
work (27:53 - 27:58)
are you still on the bad server (27:55 - 28:00)
yeah i never when i read and activated (27:58 - 28:01)
and she moved (28:00 - 28:05)
i i still have not activated i have a 60 (28:01 - 28:06)
day game card that i bought on like (28:05 - 28:08)
clearance one day so i still have that (28:06 - 28:09)
but (28:08 - 28:12)
i can can i move servers on a free trial (28:09 - 28:14)
no we're not a free trial but like the (28:12 - 28:17)
free login period uh (28:14 - 28:20)
i think as long as you pay for it yeah (28:17 - 28:22)
because i think you have to pay to move (28:20 - 28:24)
yeah it's like 10 bucks to move (28:22 - 28:27)
yeah but i think again yeah (28:24 - 28:30)
yeah that's that's fine (28:27 - 28:34)
uh yeah i mean like pokemon snap school (28:30 - 28:36)
uh very good what was your point with (28:34 - 28:38)
this just that (28:36 - 28:40)
you were surprised at how many people (28:38 - 28:42)
finished it and went beyond (28:40 - 28:43)
yeah i i just think how many people (28:42 - 28:45)
claim to have finished it (28:43 - 28:47)
look i'm trying to keep the pokemon snap (28:45 - 28:49)
alive (28:47 - 28:50)
it's like it died it's still right there (28:49 - 28:52)
you know it would bring it back to life (28:50 - 28:56)
a dlc yeah but i don't think the 60 (28:52 - 28:57)
percent of people are (28:56 - 29:00)
to suddenly finish it to get to that dlc (28:57 - 29:01)
maybe like ten percent (29:00 - 29:02)
we'll have to have another poll i'll (29:01 - 29:05)
i'll message jay like hey (29:02 - 29:07)
which would a dlc help you finish the (29:05 - 29:08)
game (29:07 - 29:11)
we need to use your audience again to (29:08 - 29:13)
get these numbers accurate (29:11 - 29:15)
and also please provide your margin of (29:13 - 29:16)
error (29:15 - 29:19)

some starters only appear in field (32:42 - 32:45)
research (32:44 - 32:48)
um some but if you don't want to do the (32:45 - 32:50)
field research you could do the lore (32:48 - 32:50)
modules (32:50 - 32:53)
those also help attract you're (32:50 - 32:55)
you're better off using the field (32:53 - 32:56)
research though all right (32:55 - 32:58)
especially because i spent all my lure (32:56 - 33:00)
modules on the last (32:58 - 33:03)
community day wrecking that park yep (33:00 - 33:05)
root in the park for everybody involved (33:03 - 33:07)
you're welcome (33:05 - 33:09)
uh the jumpstart research is back so if (33:07 - 33:10)
you haven't played (33:09 - 33:12)
i have what what is it you haven't (33:10 - 33:13)
played by x amount of time (33:12 - 33:17)

uh they also increased the item storage (33:27 - 33:34)
limit this week by 500. (33:30 - 33:35)
so if you want to spend what is what is (33:34 - 33:37)
the math on that it's like 50 for two (33:35 - 33:39)
dollars (33:37 - 33:41)
100 for four dollars you can do that (33:39 - 33:43)
five so 20 bucks to max out your store (33:41 - 33:46)
to increase your storage some more (33:43 - 33:47)

a isn't it the collection challenge (36:08 - 36:13)
collection challenge yeah so it it you (36:09 - 36:14)
you can never win it's either people say (36:13 - 36:15)
the collection challenges are too easy (36:14 - 36:17)
or then they complain they have to leave (36:15 - 36:19)
their house (36:17 - 36:19)
my problem is part of the collection (36:21 - 36:24)
channel (36:24 - 36:27)
challenge is the balloon pikachu right (36:24 - 36:28)
yeah (36:27 - 36:31)
except the only shadow balloon pikachu (36:28 - 36:34)
that shows up on my radar is a three (36:31 - 36:34)
balloons (36:34 - 36:36)
floating the pikachu pikachu it's never (36:34 - 36:38)
a number five pikachu (36:36 - 36:40)
they're all number five well then why is (36:38 - 36:42)
the shadow a three balloon (36:40 - 36:44)
you want nine to make a new shadow for (36:42 - 36:46)
their costume pokemon well obviously i (36:44 - 36:48)
was completely confused (36:46 - 36:50)
and i was like i'm not leaving my house (36:48 - 36:52)
for the three balloon pikachu i'm gonna (36:50 - 36:54)
wait until the five pikachu shows (36:52 - 36:57)
up first off i have five balloons (36:54 - 37:02)
i get foreign (36:57 - 37:03)
because that's the balloon that he's (37:02 - 37:06)
doing no no it's three regular balloons (37:03 - 37:07)
but the five (37:06 - 37:10)
is in front of the regular balloon it's (37:07 - 37:11)
not a good design (37:10 - 37:14)
oh that's fine it's like whatever (37:11 - 37:16)
i'm not trying anyone so i was pretty (37:14 - 37:18)
excited yeah (37:16 - 37:20)
that was the first balloon pikachu the (37:18 - 37:22)
the balloon peach the balloons are fine (37:20 - 37:22)
it's (37:22 - 37:24)
that weird like brace they have around (37:22 - 37:25)
pikachu's (37:24 - 37:28)
waistline that's really weird yeah the (37:25 - 37:29)
five in the (37:28 - 37:31)
in the in the hollow torture device that (37:29 - 37:34)
they have wrapped around his middle (37:31 - 37:36)
it's not great it's like i am surrounded (37:34 - 37:39)
by these balloon pikachus right now (37:36 - 37:42)
so for like uh i think it's the i think (37:39 - 37:45)
it's the johto (37:42 - 37:45)
starters and then i think it's the (37:46 - 37:49)
sinnoh starters (37:48 - 37:52)
are limited to field research (37:49 - 37:56)
and why or you could use lures (37:52 - 37:58)
and and for the most part the field (37:56 - 38:00)
research i i guess i would see the (37:58 - 38:03)
complaints if the field research wasn't (38:00 - 38:06)
easy to get but they're the it's like (38:03 - 38:07)
one of them is (38:06 - 38:09)
get five great throws and the other one (38:07 - 38:10)
is (38:09 - 38:13)
take five snapshots of wild pokemon (38:10 - 38:14)
that's how do i trash (38:13 - 38:16)
no the snapshots is that'll get you like (38:14 - 38:17)
kanto i think (38:16 - 38:21)
canto starters i think the other one is (38:17 - 38:23)
um use five berries i think when (38:21 - 38:24)
catching (38:23 - 38:27)
they're pretty easy but i guess again i (38:24 - 38:29)
live in the city so i i have stops (38:27 - 38:30)
everywhere so if (38:29 - 38:31)
it's one i don't need i just delete it (38:30 - 38:33)
and move on but i mean they're giving (38:31 - 38:33)

following oh so (52:46 - 52:51)
sorry everything we just read doesn't (52:48 - 52:52)
does it matter if you have a ticket or (52:51 - 52:53)
not you can find your (52:52 - 52:56)
ponytas your zigzagoons your pikachus (52:53 - 52:58)
don't need a ticket for the special (52:56 - 53:00)
trades or what we just read (52:58 - 53:04)
um speaking of tickets (53:00 - 53:05)
if you're listening to this on monday (53:04 - 53:07)
niantic did give me (53:05 - 53:10)
10 tickets to give away to you guys (53:07 - 53:13)
so if you're into the slack or the (53:10 - 53:14)
discord are on twitter (53:13 - 53:17)
there'll be there'll be a way to try to (53:14 - 53:18)
earn those tickets (53:17 - 53:20)
i know not i know it's only five dollars (53:18 - 53:22)
this year i know some (53:20 - 53:23)
five dollars can be tight for some (53:22 - 53:25)
people or they could be on the fence so (53:23 - 53:28)
we got 10 tickets to give away (53:25 - 53:29)
so if you're listening to the podcast (53:28 - 53:31)
check socials at some point (53:29 - 53:32)
i'm sure i'm sure they'll be up for a (53:31 - 53:34)
way to win those tickets (53:32 - 53:35)
i want to give them to people who listen (53:34 - 53:38)
to the show so (53:35 - 53:41)
alright so if you're a ticket holder (53:38 - 53:43)
certain pokemon during the event will no (53:41 - 53:45)
special attacks please note that only (53:43 - 53:46)
ticket holders will encounter these (53:45 - 53:47)

with draining kiss (53:49 - 53:52)
rockstar pikachu with meteor mash pick (53:50 - 53:54)
one you would like (53:52 - 53:57)
as you encounter your special research (53:54 - 54:00)
i think i don't have confirmation here i (53:57 - 54:01)
thought (54:00 - 54:04)
i was told that you will get more of one (54:01 - 54:04)
of these (54:04 - 54:08)
so you could trade to the other person (54:04 - 54:08)
that makes sense um because like yeah if (54:08 - 54:12)
you (54:12 - 54:15)
lock into rockstar i mean you'll have to (54:12 - 54:18)
trade for the other one uh gardevoir (54:15 - 54:20)
will no synchronize flygon will know (54:18 - 54:21)
earth power (54:20 - 54:22)
both will potentially be wearing (54:21 - 54:24)
mellowetta inspired hats as you complete (54:22 - 54:26)
your research you'll be prompted to (54:24 - 54:27)
select which costume pokemon you would (54:26 - 54:29)

saturday looks to be a (62:10 - 62:14)
lovely day here at 80 degrees is that (62:11 - 62:15)
sarcasm (62:14 - 62:18)

that's perfect (62:18 - 62:20)
yeah that's actually real nice and it's (62:18 - 62:22)
like perfect weather (62:20 - 62:26)
um so yeah i i (62:22 - 62:28)
spent a lot of money getting like an (62:26 - 62:30)
unlimited data plan multiple modems to (62:28 - 62:31)
do this like pokemon go backpack and (62:30 - 62:33)
i've been streaming (62:31 - 62:35)
the last week and this upcoming week so (62:33 - 62:37)
the plan is to stream on saturday with (62:35 - 62:38)
greg and will (62:37 - 62:40)
um and just walk around the park and (62:38 - 62:41)
have a good time and i know other people (62:40 - 62:43)
will be playing go (62:41 - 62:45)
as well uh but obviously you could put (62:43 - 62:47)
twitch in audio only mode (62:45 - 62:50)
um and you can listen along or you know (62:47 - 62:51)
if you're playing at home (62:50 - 62:53)
it's kind of it kind of sucks to play at (62:51 - 62:55)
home but i know like not all the world (62:53 - 62:56)
is (62:55 - 62:59)
in a super great place uh (62:56 - 63:00)
some have it better than others for sure (62:59 - 63:02)
so you can have the twitch stream up if (63:00 - 63:04)
no one watches no big deal you know if (63:02 - 63:06)
five people watch and i make those (63:04 - 63:07)
the day for those five people i feel (63:06 - 63:09)
like that's worth it but uh (63:07 - 63:13)
the goal the plan is to stream go fest (63:09 - 63:17)
outside with greg and will on saturday (63:13 - 63:18)
and then sunday we'll probably be at (63:17 - 63:20)
mall of america yep because that's the (63:18 - 63:21)
best place for raids so we won't be (63:20 - 63:23)
streaming that one because that's (63:21 - 63:24)
private property (63:23 - 63:26)
uh so while i don't think mall of (63:24 - 63:27)
america would probably care (63:26 - 63:30)
the music they play in the mall would (63:27 - 63:32)
definitely make twitch care and i don't (63:30 - 63:32)
want to be (63:32 - 63:36)
dmcad for i'm pretty sure mall of (63:32 - 63:36)
america (63:36 - 63:39)
will care so i could probably get by two (63:36 - 63:42)
hours without them noticing (63:39 - 63:42)
i mean i i am obligated to report you (63:42 - 63:49)
as a as you would be that person as a (63:47 - 63:50)
citizen of minnesota (63:49 - 63:54)

ambassador to the mall of america in my (63:54 - 63:57)
home estate (63:56 - 64:00)
as much as y'all y'all minnesotans (63:57 - 64:02)
always complain about mall of america (64:00 - 64:04)
but you'll be the first people to be (64:02 - 64:05)

to be like arrest arrest this outsider (64:05 - 64:12)

drought music is playing it is it is (66:31 - 66:36)
soul crushing (66:33 - 66:36)

viola is (67:59 - 68:03)
but i would argue that aquacord town (68:00 - 68:04)
which is the one (68:03 - 68:05)
before that where nothing happens and (68:04 - 68:08)
you're just by oh is that where you (68:05 - 68:10)
you get the nickname of like little p or (68:08 - 68:11)
big d (68:10 - 68:13)
yes you have to leave your house and you (68:11 - 68:14)
go up to the first town (68:13 - 68:17)
yeah well the very very very very first (68:14 - 68:19)
town that you're in is vandeville town (68:17 - 68:23)
yeah because that's where you live (68:19 - 68:24)
and then you go to (68:23 - 68:27)
[Music] (68:24 - 68:29)
that sort of middle area and then (68:27 - 68:32)
aquacord town and then santalune city (68:29 - 68:34)
and then lumio city which is crash (68:32 - 68:37)
central (68:34 - 68:37)
was (68:37 - 68:40)
lumio city is the worst town why (68:40 - 68:47)
because that map is all like the angles (68:44 - 68:48)
that it points you at (68:47 - 68:51)
it gives you so many options yeah the (68:48 - 68:52)
only option is (68:51 - 68:55)
where's the taxi hop on they give you (68:52 - 68:59)
taxis yeah because you need them (68:55 - 69:01)
what's okay so your favorite town is (68:59 - 69:02)
goldenrod (69:01 - 69:06)
for why why what the golden rod has the (69:02 - 69:07)
radio tower (69:06 - 69:10)
it has the bullet train it has a (69:07 - 69:13)
mall it has a guy telling you the deal (69:10 - 69:14)
like (69:13 - 69:16)
he is nimbasta city has all those and (69:14 - 69:18)
ferris wheels (69:16 - 69:21)
is my favorite nambasa has it (69:18 - 69:24)
all it has a musical theater it has the (69:21 - 69:26)
gear station you want to battle (69:24 - 69:29)
ingo and all his comrades go right on (69:26 - 69:31)
it's got the ferris wheel where you can (69:29 - 69:34)
go on ambiguous dates with people (69:31 - 69:36)
i feel like the ferris wheel brings it (69:34 - 69:37)
down it has (69:36 - 69:41)
the what here's what you forgot (69:37 - 69:44)
it has the weird person where you have (69:41 - 69:45)
to find (69:44 - 69:48)
the exact spot to stand on that they (69:45 - 69:48)
call you (69:48 - 69:49)
up and they're like i'm not going to (69:48 - 69:52)
tell you who i am but keep getting my (69:49 - 69:54)
phone calls and eventually i'll (69:52 - 69:57)
change your special pokemon yeah why (69:54 - 69:59)
don't they do fun stuff like that in (69:57 - 70:01)
pokemon games (69:59 - 70:04)
a city of anymore and love yup (70:01 - 70:07)
oh it has everything and the worst (70:04 - 70:11)
city is uh i think it's for a tree (70:07 - 70:12)
is that the one where you have to like (70:11 - 70:14)
everybody lives up in the trees (70:12 - 70:16)
uh four trees are great you have to keep (70:14 - 70:18)
climbing up and then it's just (70:16 - 70:19)
it's got the castle yeah that blocked (70:18 - 70:21)
the paths the on the blocks (70:19 - 70:25)
nah not past people are too weird (70:21 - 70:27)
change city to location worst location (70:25 - 70:32)
mount cornet all right moving on (70:27 - 70:32)
i'm trying to argue with that and i'm (70:33 - 70:36)
not successful (70:35 - 70:40)
it's hard it is yeah (70:36 - 70:44)
it's certainly so bad okay what's the (70:40 - 70:46)
one in johto though what's the mountain (70:44 - 70:47)
but you don't have to go into it yeah (70:46 - 70:49)
coordinates still worse (70:47 - 70:52)
i will say the (70:49 - 70:54)
tape well i have to agree with you it's (70:52 - 70:56)
the worst it's so (70:54 - 70:59)
it's like oh zuma and psyduck this sucks (70:56 - 71:01)
wait what is the what is the kanto ship (70:59 - 71:02)
is that the ssan (71:01 - 71:05)
ssa yeah yes okay so the (71:02 - 71:09)
implementation of the ssn in (71:05 - 71:11)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee was the (71:09 - 71:12)
worst implementation (71:11 - 71:15)
of any location because if you (71:12 - 71:17)
accidentally spoke to the captain (71:15 - 71:19)
you didn't get to meet and battle any of (71:17 - 71:21)
the trainers (71:19 - 71:23)
i think that's how it worked in um fine (71:21 - 71:24)
yellow (71:23 - 71:26)
worst location because they messed it up (71:24 - 71:28)
i say yeah (71:26 - 71:29)
yeah because that was that weird thing (71:28 - 71:31)
where you could like skip everyone and (71:29 - 71:32)
then the ship (71:31 - 71:33)
leaves and you're like all that money (71:32 - 71:35)
and experience (71:33 - 71:37)
i need to fleece all these people with (71:35 - 71:39)
my high powered pokemon (71:37 - 71:42)
how am i suppected to live (71:39 - 71:42)
what's our youtube ah let's do (71:48 - 71:54)
hannah this week okay which pokemon if (71:51 - 71:55)
turned into a building would (71:54 - 71:59)
be at least structurally integra (71:55 - 72:01)
integral as an example because it's an (71:59 - 72:03)
odd question doraldon and charger bug (72:01 - 72:04)
will be (72:03 - 72:07)
very integral given their overall body (72:04 - 72:10)
shapes well they have the best integrity (72:07 - 72:12)
not integral those words mean different (72:10 - 72:15)
things uh carnivore (72:12 - 72:17)
carnivine it is a bit wiggly at the (72:15 - 72:18)
bottom isn't it (72:17 - 72:22)
it's very top-heavy and has very very (72:18 - 72:24)
very bad structure would it not be (72:22 - 72:27)
spoink (72:24 - 72:27)
see no because spoink has flow (72:28 - 72:33)
you can attach you can attach the spring (72:31 - 72:35)
also spoink (72:33 - 72:38)
is about the same shape as (72:35 - 72:42)
its uh spring (72:38 - 72:45)
it's it's balanced and the real answer (72:42 - 72:48)
is uh grimer (72:45 - 72:52)
you can't you just can't you can't (72:48 - 72:55)
you can you can't turn that into a (72:52 - 72:56)
building (72:55 - 72:58)
uh spritzy spritzy's only on two tiny (72:56 - 72:59)
tiny (72:58 - 73:01)
little legs with a really really big (72:59 - 73:03)
yeah but see like architects like to be (73:01 - 73:05)
all fancy and be like look at how big i (73:03 - 73:06)
can put this thing on top of something (73:05 - 73:08)
so spindly and small (73:06 - 73:11)
that's true (73:08 - 73:11)
what about spinda very wobbly (73:13 - 73:18)
i think that's like yeah intentionally (73:16 - 73:20)
designed to collapse at some point (73:18 - 73:22)
yeah because like at least would be good (73:20 - 73:23)
in an earthquake because don't they put (73:22 - 73:25)
springs in the bottom of like japanese (73:23 - 73:26)
buildings (73:25 - 73:28)
uh they put springs in the bottoms of (73:26 - 73:30)
lots of buildings where (73:28 - 73:32)
they places are prone to earthquakes yes (73:30 - 73:34)
although springs i don't think is the (73:32 - 73:35)
word for it (73:34 - 73:37)
i think something more like a cantilever (73:35 - 73:41)
is probably what you're thinking of (73:37 - 73:44)
uh oh god (73:41 - 73:44)
somebody call up the salesforce tower in (73:46 - 73:50)
san francisco see how they built that (73:47 - 73:53)
not a lot of balance i feel like when (73:50 - 73:54)
you think of not a lot of balance you (73:53 - 73:57)
think spinda (73:54 - 73:57)
i mean agreed but also cure them (73:58 - 74:04)
because kieran's always like half one (74:01 - 74:04)
thing (74:04 - 74:06)
never the other half yeah what about (74:04 - 74:08)
drake algae (74:06 - 74:12)
uh well see the thing is that's like (74:08 - 74:13)
a floating water platform that could (74:12 - 74:15)
actually work yeah (74:13 - 74:18)
it's got the pods it's got yeah it's got (74:15 - 74:20)
them got a lot of pods (74:18 - 74:21)
uh i'm trying to think if there's (74:20 - 74:23)
anything (74:21 - 74:27)
porygon z a porganzi would be terrible (74:23 - 74:30)
nothing in that building would work (74:27 - 74:30)
nothing (74:30 - 74:34)
no you know what uh spirit tomb (74:30 - 74:36)
because it'd be like it looks like it's (74:34 - 74:37)
a solid rock (74:36 - 74:39)
building you go in there and you never (74:37 - 74:42)
come out (74:39 - 74:45)
you're dead uh (74:42 - 74:49)
i feel like gia ju would be solid (74:45 - 74:50)
because it just has to say yeah yeah i (74:49 - 74:52)
do do probably pretty solid i feel like (74:50 - 74:55)
most rock pokemon yeah (74:52 - 74:57)
you'd be pretty all right with yeah (74:55 - 74:58)
chandelier (74:57 - 75:01)
how about lampant (74:58 - 75:01)
palace and that's a good one yeah that's (75:01 - 75:04)
a solid that's not (75:03 - 75:06)
in the anime they said they were inside (75:04 - 75:09)
the palace and it was pretty solid (75:06 - 75:10)
that's what i'm saying that would be a (75:09 - 75:12)
good one not a bad yeah yeah (75:10 - 75:16)
yeah sand is a strong yeah i think so (75:12 - 75:18)
baby would be fine (75:16 - 75:19)
because it's got that whole stem that (75:18 - 75:21)
would be fun yeah and that's another (75:19 - 75:23)
like the architect wants to prove that (75:21 - 75:25)
they can balance a top-heavy (75:23 - 75:30)
building it's kind of mine (75:25 - 75:32)
yeah probably carnivale carnivate's the (75:30 - 75:34)
worst chat top maybe (75:32 - 75:37)
nah chad chad is a rock museum rock hall (75:34 - 75:40)
of fame yeah (75:37 - 75:45)
uh well pokemon of the week (75:40 - 75:47)
all right last week's pokemon uh this (75:45 - 75:48)
was i (75:47 - 75:51)
i couldn't have made it easier for you (75:48 - 75:51)
uh (75:51 - 75:54)
i referenced it it comes it's one of the (75:51 - 75:55)
pokemon that's (75:54 - 75:58)
available as a playable character in (75:55 - 76:01)
super smash brothers ultimate so not one (75:58 - 76:03)
of the side pokemon that you can't play (76:01 - 76:03)
as (76:03 - 76:07)
um two of those characters could be say (76:03 - 76:09)
it could be said to have uh the same (76:07 - 76:10)
career (76:09 - 76:12)
possibly which i know that confused some (76:10 - 76:14)
people but whatever (76:12 - 76:17)
um but it's one of those ones (76:14 - 76:19)
and it's the one whose up special move (76:17 - 76:20)
could accidentally (76:19 - 76:22)
cause you to fall off a platform if you (76:20 - 76:25)
don't aim it properly (76:22 - 76:25)
or let me put it this way because that (76:27 - 76:31)
was all the distracting stuff that i put (76:29 - 76:32)
in (76:31 - 76:35)
to make it harder for people who don't (76:32 - 76:36)
listen to every word (76:35 - 76:39)
um the appropriate sentence was in the (76:36 - 76:41)
popular home video game series uh (76:39 - 76:43)
two of the playable characters derived (76:41 - 76:44)
from sibling nintendo based home video (76:43 - 76:46)
game series pokemon sun (76:44 - 76:50)
and pokemon moon can be said to (76:46 - 76:51)
potentially (76:50 - 76:54)
share a career (76:51 - 76:54)
you guys don't know any of the playable (76:54 - 77:03)
characters from super smash (76:56 - 77:06)
i i think i know who it is maybe (77:03 - 77:07)
incineroar (77:06 - 77:09)
yeah is it incineroar it's incineroar (77:07 - 77:10)
yes (77:09 - 77:12)
because there is a luchador pikachu in (77:10 - 77:14)
smash brothers (77:12 - 77:18)
and incineroar is a wrestler (77:14 - 77:20)
but all you had to do i think incineroar (77:18 - 77:22)
is the only sun and moon pokemon (77:20 - 77:28)
in super smash brothers uh i think so (77:22 - 77:28)
because i know greninja is in there as a (77:29 - 77:33)
playable you got the pikachu you got the (77:31 - 77:35)
jigglypuff (77:33 - 77:39)
kirby got the mewtwo (77:35 - 77:41)
yeah i love kirby my favorite pokemon (77:39 - 77:43)
[Laughter] (77:41 - 77:45)
uh i like incineroar real good real good (77:43 - 77:47)
shiny i think (77:45 - 77:48)
i have to look it up i have to see it (77:47 - 77:51)
does it even have a shuffle icon (77:48 - 77:54)
yeah sure yeah (77:51 - 77:58)
it does it's pretty good senora's all (77:54 - 77:58)
right (77:58 - 78:01)
well how do you feel about incineroar uh (77:58 - 78:05)
not my first choice for a pokemon but (78:01 - 78:07)
i mean it's not the worst of all the (78:05 - 78:09)
pokemon oh the shuffle icons are real (78:07 - 78:11)
good (78:09 - 78:14)
it's got that it's got that look on his (78:11 - 78:14)
face (78:14 - 78:16)
well because it's the heel pokemon it is (78:14 - 78:17)
the heel (78:16 - 78:19)
also the shiny is one of the better (78:17 - 78:21)
shinies that exist it's a good shiny (78:19 - 78:24)
the white tiger is outstanding i did a (78:21 - 78:28)
whole video on why instant aurora is (78:24 - 78:32)
the way incineroar is on youtube (78:28 - 78:34)
don't roll your eyes are you a trying (78:32 - 78:36)
guy to be a heel they only do it because (78:34 - 78:38)
that's where the money is (78:36 - 78:39)
for the money is insider are still the (78:38 - 78:41)
number one pokemon competitive (78:39 - 78:44)
as well it's real good got a good (78:41 - 78:45)
moveset (78:44 - 78:48)
good typing got good ability (78:45 - 78:51)
just lines up is the only evolved form (78:48 - 78:52)
of a starter pokemon we have a lower (78:51 - 78:56)
base debt than its pre-evolved forms (78:52 - 78:58)
interesting its speed set is 30 points (78:56 - 79:00)
lower than torah cats and 10 points (78:58 - 79:02)
lower than litten (79:00 - 79:09)
it's a slow slow slow tiger (79:02 - 79:12)
what about use it with trick room no you (79:09 - 79:13)
don't use the center (79:12 - 79:16)
ticker don't even sit down considering (79:13 - 79:18)
it's a combination of incinerate (79:16 - 79:21)
and roar who would have guessed uh (79:18 - 79:22)
what's next week (79:21 - 79:26)
all right here we go just plowing (79:22 - 79:27)
forward (79:26 - 79:29)
as part of the celebration of pokemon (79:27 - 79:32)
go's fifth anniversary (79:29 - 79:35)
rather than making the 555th pokemon (79:32 - 79:36)
appear in the wild (79:35 - 79:38)
they have made one of its pre-evolutions (79:36 - 79:41)
the 554th pokemon appear (79:38 - 79:43)
and is now potentially catchable as a (79:41 - 79:45)
shiny if this trend continues (79:43 - 79:48)
next year the promoted pokemon may make (79:45 - 79:52)
you feel a little sick to your stomach (79:48 - 79:52)
that's what you get that's it i think i (79:52 - 79:57)
know what it is (79:55 - 80:00)
[Laughter] (79:57 - 80:02)
