[Applause] [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 250 second episode of the Pokemon podcast i'm your host SP j it's super effective i forgot to say that we are in generation 3 of this show I suppose I guess that's something that we've accomplished with me today I have will I was just going to have a drink of water now that you mentioned that we're in generation and that uh that cunning delightful laughs you heard is from Travis I guess he does play the trumpet did she I didn't audio edit that in that is Travis playing the trumpet and let's Travis as a sound board over there no no no it was making it can you figure out why I'm playing the trumpet I remember I remember the comment last week yeah yeah yeah that's that's reason one can you remember the real reason reason to why this episode of all episodes cuz we've started gen 3 is that it yeah and what about gen 3 there's a lot of horns hey that's it I love how you are both you were both there's like a lot of like horns and trumpets and the music when when people make fun of gin threes music they say all the trumpets right and because the soundfont of generation 3 is very different than the previous games and has a lot of synthesized horns in it so that's the joke Wow both prepared with gen 3 jokes hey I was just now I'm thinking of an embossed cuz that an embosser city soundtrack is all brass but whatever nothing but your idea is what started all that though well we got a show for you guys today pretty straightforward we got a little bit of pokemon news and then I pulled some emails and then travis has their pic for Pokemon of the week and then what will what will happen is probably all that stuff will be drawn out like it always is because we ramble especially when it comes to emails but that's okay I think it'll be a great show regardless but before we get to the Monday's before we get to the emails what is new with you two well I got some really exciting news yeah let's hear I ready for it uh-huh well okay I mean you guys you guys both know I went to the doctor yesterday right yep and after an extremely thorough investigation examination with high res 4k digital photography there is in controvert able proof that my head is nowhere near up my butt so so for anybody who ever thought that will anderson had his head firmly up his own but i can get you copies of those photos to show it Julian and clear good that's a really good joke and I'm also glad that there was nothing of concern oh yeah no cancer either yay glad Willis was safe and secure from the doctor Travis what about what about you well I just got back today from watching John wick chapter 2 had I seen John wick chapter one no I had not but I knew one thing don't set him off all right what's what's your the tat that's the tagline for John wick the first one would be do you see the the video where they edited it so that instead of him goin nuts it was his dog oh it's incredible yes sweet hahaha what's your 10 second movie review was it worth seeing the second John wick it is a very hmm it is an action movie it is good at being an action movie it is little else but hey it's not really trying to be that much else and sometimes it actually becomes a little bit more but rarely but if you just want a good action movie it's pretty good do you think that without seeing the first one do you think the first one is probably better oh wait i just heard that question in my ears and then my brain heard it and it was like without having seen her so i think is but yes in my perfect imagination is the personal I was like on par with the greatest films of the 21st century that I think I I think that is a really interesting question because it poses whether I think John wick to is a good sequel to a film I haven't seen like does John wick to deliver on all of the same levels that we've come to expect for the John wick franchise that I have not seen and I think that's an interesting question i would probably say that the first one is probably people are probably gonna like the first one more i would imagine that the first one is a little more focused a little less sprawling than his John wick chapter 2 but again I have not seen John wick the chapter one so it's probably a circumstance like the godfather 2 & Aliens where the second the sequel is actually better than the first movie I thought you were suggesting the aliens was a sequel to The Godfather too so uh you know they they really stretched it out with godfather to aliens but I think they made it work game over man game over the last 15 minutes that movie really of aliens really ties back to the Godfather no I I asked that because a lot of times sequels never live up to the original so I was just curious for seeing a sequel if that sequel was enjoyable I I enjoyed myself yeah although yeah aliens and aliens and Godfather Part 2 along with I would argue the Empire Strikes Back are all examples of sequels that are better on the first film so there are some examples toy story 2 was a pretty good sequel but i would say that toy story 3 is the best out of all of them I would concur and i would say space Jumanji was much better than original juba that's a that's a that's a deep cut for a long time listener I forgot we ever talking about space Jumanji oh man alright cool John wick too I guess go see it would weigh ok I guess the last wish to set him off ok wait don't wait I got one question before you asked you asked questions so yeah sure all right did you have to wear a costume since you obviously had to go to not the MU Theater you work at to see this film dude like trench coat sunglasses and a big hat so that your fellow theater workers didn't know you're going to the popular theater here so here well yeah so here's the interesting thing one of my good friends from my hometown where I'm currently living before for a few months before i moved to winnipeg by a few it's probably gonna end up being about six but anyway one of my friends from high school and I'm you know still friends with works at the theater that works for the theater chain that's the larger conglomerate in the region so there's an interesting dynamic there where I work at the small local theater and he's a like I think he's rejectionist at the larger chain so there's a bit of a you've got mail scenario except that we're not romantically involved so we went so he got us in free because he works there and I didn't want to go see it at the place I work cuz I didn't want to go to work to watch a movie sure but also why does your indie theatre show John wick to it is interested what I say in D because that's what I knew it as when I was a kid I and and in high school because they played they were relied on independent and foreign films but their head Travis was younger now and he wrote in to the podcast and we plan on a radially email that he wrote it no I'm just kidding we're not reading at this episode so that's when I was a ute in in DC and we used to have many more movie theaters that's the one we would have called the adult theater I believe No haha alright what was your notion steve-o my question was was it worth the theatre price but Travis got in for free I knowed it was certainly worth it for me I was just saying is it worth seeing in theatres or do you feel like this could be a weight for weight for VHS or you know Betamax while there are well there's a lot that the film does visually to make you go oh really did that um I wouldn't say that it's like visually stunning in the sense of a film where like if you're not seeing it in in the full format you're not really like yeah you can just wait for it to be on streaming whatever it's funny because I talked about John wick to today on that friends podcast which will go up in a bit there's only a few episodes of that show so far it's called port of dorks I don't know when that episode that I guessed it on to talk about John wick to is going to be but i'll be on there talking about John wick 2 i'm talking about John wick to as a joke here on this podcast and I'm gonna talk about John wick to you on the arbitrary archives so I'm just I'm really spreading the gospel of Keanu across all of my channel he's selling tickets left and right to this movie which is funny because i'm not i'm just obsessed with the idea of John wick to more than i am the actual film i feel ya all right don't set him off with that being said let's jump into some pokemon news not a lot of news this week but we'll start off with the first one pokemon duel update version 3.0 point one that came out on februari ninth i believe pokemon doulas received a small update to fix some minor bugs this patch will upgrade the version and it requires 163 megabytes to install nothing really stating what it did Travis are you still dueling are you still Pokemon dueling I will admit I've been playing it less now that I've been playing the fire emblem iOS game which I'm having more fun with oh whoa ah we brought a Pokemon because it's a Pokemon show but I want to hear your thoughts on the fire emblem game and I want mostly because I want you to you know compare it because what i originally said is i believed that pok√©mon duel and Fire Emblem Duke it kind of the same core target audience and strategy games they are both top-down strategy games where you're controlling a set of four or so it's more in Pokemon duel but just for the sake of it four or so pieces that you move around a grid or battling purposes but I would say that that's where the similarities and someone I was talking to a Pokemon duel described it as a little feeling a little more like more akin to chess or something like that where it's a lot about movement of pieces which is important in Fire Emblem as well but the I would say they are kind of different games that there well not kind of they are significantly different games even though they're both strategy games I'll still play pokemon duel probably just about like once a day to get a login bonus and play a match or two but I have been investing more time into fire emblem and your first fire emblem game right yeah what are your impressions without playing any fire emblem game in the series would you say that this is the best I mean I think it's very clear that they've done down a lot of them again I like it I've always been a fan of the line I'm tackling that right there yeah I've always been a fan of the final fantasy tactics franchise so this is very similar although it doesn't have what I would argue is the best part of final fantasy tactics which is the robust job system but it's similar and enjoyable yeah I don't have a lot to say about the fire emblem heroes game other than it's pretty fun and the fan service is really troubling but you know whatever yeah you take what you can get ready I guess yeah well you are you did you play duel you're boycotting fire emblem okay not been playing any of that no duel for you nope all right although I should I well okay so here's the problem I'm at the point in Pokemon picross where the only stages i haven't crowned yet are the ones that are only used time skills which basically means you get no assistance on determining which squares need to be filled and which squares need to be left empty and since i only a lot about seven minutes for pokemon picross every day it's really hard for me to do those ones so i might just be primed to pick up dual as my daily seven minute routine yeah after i saw or that amount of time it after I saw the update I'm now more more willing to give it a shot now that it seems to you they seem to be starting to fix things with it not that I heard like clearly the game works people are playing it but I just I've heard from people I trust that it's just and I've said this before slow sluggish and whatnot and I don't have a lot of patience when it comes to that next bit of news here is the wait is over Sun and Moon expansion before the pokemon TCG has officially launched this email came to me a bit ago so we're a couple days late here the sentiment expansion comes with a hundred and forty all new cards this expansion includes three new theme decks and forty plus brand new Pokemon unique to the ole ola region including a lowland variants of classic pokemon with new art and ability pokemon GX cards are also included and rare pokemon with powerful attacks can only be used once per game for the TCG fans you guys are probably already buying those cards up more Pokemon spin-off games is Pokemon go there Valentine's Day event is going live I already went live went live on februari eighth and it will go until februari 15 during this promotion candy earned by catching hatching and transferring Pokemon is doubled buddy pokemon can also find candy twice as often additionally pink Pokemon such as chancy and clefable will appear more frequently in the wild during the event cleffa egli buff and Smoochum are more likely to hatch from eggs finally lure modules will last six hours during the event instead of their usual half hour duration man six hours is long it's pretty sweet getting the best value for your modules by both of you guys I'm pretty sure both you guys fell off Pokemon go but I could be wrong correct me if I'm wrong uh well I need to reinstall it so I can try it with my apple watch to find out if my Apple watch does better than your apple watch well I mean since my cold it is too cold since I complained they have updated the Apple watch app does it still crash I don't know I haven't tested it since I'd be lying if I said I I've been playing pokemon go go but like Travis said it's it's way too cold outside it's like 22 degrees here Wisconsin I mean it's not that much warmer here so I don't want to hear it other bit of news here is sera Ruiz Yoshida's machamp is now available in Japan I apologize for butchering that name a machamp inspired by Japanese Olympic wrestler soraya Yoshida will be distributed from gym from februari eighth to ferry 28th for Pokemon Sun and Moon Yoshida appeared in a Japanese commercial for Pokemon Sun and Moon in January featuring Machamp it will be available in Japan via 7 spot and 7-eleven stores and it will be at a couple other stores that I cannot pronounce via the 3ds stations at the store the stores operate and will also be available at pokemon center stores the Machamp will be level 34 have the ability guts have no held item and we'll know the moves double-edged bulk up strength quick guard and its original chant trainer will be Yoshida and it will be featured in a cherish ball so there you go that's pretty cool also jet Japan has 7 11 s that's pretty sweet and apparently a pan is the land of the 7-eleven you know nothing of Japan set their the land day of the 7-eleven they love convenience stores oh I know that but like 7-eleven disturbing is the king of the convenience store they didn't start in japan though that's what you made it seem like they started in texas but trust me that sounds me there's anything I've learned about Japan as they love convenience stores I'm down with a good convenience store we have a we have like one 7-eleven in Milwaukee I drove past it today closed board it up completely shut down so I don't know I'm gonna do in July eleventh when it's free slurpee day go to show so now it's 70 bro rough there no I think it's really good because of why 7-eleven is called 7-eleven when I called 7 11 cuz it was when it originally opened it was open 11 hours a day 7 days a week isn't that I think that's our suspicions yes so seven hours 7 0 7 days a week 11 hours a day I thought that's why it was called 7-eleven okay I suppose that make sense so I think my joke was was very erudite very uh it was a thinker um which might have flown over the heads of gross yeah I understand GTS updates the most used pokemon in pokemon refresh is still in cinah roar pokemon traded via the GTS is 83 million and finally the global mission trade pokemon at the GTS which ends at seven pm on februari 13th which is monday so if you're listening to this monday morning you'll still have time the goal was 1,000,000 pokemon they have successfully hit the goal at three million 222,000 pokemon traded over the GTS which I believe gives you like 2,000 bottle caps or something like that if you participate no it doesn't give you nice jobs in battle points the festival coin that's oil no it is Battle Points I think no it's festival conscious trust me yes what can i buy with busting bones can i buy buy baby too many battle points what do people want two people want coins do they want points do they want bottle caps well you use your festival coins to update your festival Plaza so that you get the lottery that gives you bottle caps correct what come on that's just basic just give me the bottle caps know there are other things that you can do in festival Plaza other than receive bottle caps look I want to have fun when I play pokemon no that's not allowed apparently not you know haven I mean the festival plazas where it's at yeah clearly it's or not so yeah if you haven't done so already trade at least one pokemon for the GTS which I plan to do after I've done recording this and then I'm going to release that Pokemon in the wild because I don't trust it's it's off that usually I can make this easy for your Steve just sign up for the global cup of the global event in your festival plaza and don't even touch the GTS just signing up get you the reward really yes sir huh alright cool I'm down with that that's easy Millennials they don't have to work for anything good they get up our dates participation trophy awesome get all my coins well I guess we'll find out next week if that works but it's not it seems like it where it would work because it's a global effort right correct all right well then uh what we'll do is we will take a quick break and when we come back we have some emails and our pokemon of the week [Music] garbage garbage garbage [Music] and we are back from our break let's tackle some emails email it up e-mail city if you have any emails for us any questions comments concerns complaints pokemon or non pokemon related do not hesitate to send us an email that email address is SB j at PK em n CA esti pok√©mon podcast.com or you go over to Pokemon podcast.com and hit the contact button and that will get yet to the same place first email here is from will well you're all you're on the show you don't write in well sometimes I like to exercise my creative energies and alternative methods mediums all right all right we'll from Indiana so it looks like you traveled to the only well in Indiana i'm sure i wish i lived in indiana do you i don't think anyone has ever said that there are so many cute guys in indiana it's just like the cute guy stayed so order dear pok√©mon podcast crew Travis you have no idea the monster magic lore has become hahahahahahahahaha chick has grown to the point where time imagine gathering and the word monster before could also be supplemented for like gigantic or huger I know without seeing the words that might not have made sense maybe it did maybe I'm just ran no I think it made perfect sense okay cut it out cut it out cut it out magic has grown to the point where there there's more lure added every week sets come out every three months each with its own world and lure that explored leading up to and after the set is released there's also two or three supplemental products each year that have that our own lower around them some of them have entire sets in addition to the main for each year and others are pre constructed decks that expand on old characters and introduce new ones it's actually gotten pretty crazy to keep up with to keep up with it as much as I can and it's only growing also yes Jase is a character and there are several angels question for all of you all right now under the pokemon stuff we'll just wanted to clear up the magic lore I just I guess I apologize for assuming there that magic Laura was only released at such a frequency that you could theoretically just backlog a lot of episodes and release them I apologize for that in some assumption about the amount of things that wizards of the coast is saying about yog moth see I no more magic things than I didn't know at the top of my head last week so I've been thinking about the things I know about magic and about a week in case this came up again yog mwah that's another name Black Lotus now Black Lotus is not a character Black Lotus is a card from the original set of the game that was too broken and therefore it costs a lot of money but it's not it's illegal to use it illegal it's not against the law you get arrested yeah uh yeah can you pull over uh ma'am is that up instead of black lotus in your passenger seat is it is that a Miss is that a deck of magic cards that you have there I'm gonna I'm gonna have to see your deck I think I see a time walk the feud cards down miss can I ask you where you got this Black Lotus he is met Mina's I actually play TCG's diamond are participating in this combat hahahahaha a question for all of you this is still from will by the way what do you think about the current methods of attaining heavily viable Pokemon game freak keeps adding new features with every release that makes the getting perfect ivs EV training and leveling easier they also take away features too as we come to expect I've never never liked that you had to breed boxes worth of Pokemon to get a single good one or having to soft reset legendaries to get a specific hidden power type it took me hours of software setting both top of cocoa and tabu ley ley to get them with HP fire hidden power fire though part of it may have to do with my compulsion to catch everything in premiere balls exclusively I don't know if I would want it to be easy as something like pokemon showdown where everything's available to you but what you have to do is still boring and tedious love the show but everyone but will hands down is my favorite this is no way influenced by him having the same name as me Steve I could take her leave will from Indiana haha that was kind of a confusing ending does he like me or does he not like me will hands down as my favorite oh okay I think you left out the hands down part oh maybe I did my mistake now I'm i like the changes i because i mean if you do notice there has been a trade-off that yes it's now much easier to get perfect ivs without having to breed breed breed till the end of days to get perfect ivs or to get a mysterious 6iv ditto from japan like everybody seems to have the same one but it they've made it now much harder to get your Pokemon up to level 100 which they have to be in order to use bottle caps to get their IVs improved but think about it this way when you're getting one Pokemon up to level 100 you are focusing all the work on that one Pokemon and not just aimlessly generating eggs and trying to get the eggs to have the right IVs does that make sense am I saying something real here ya know it does also in sun and moon there's no good place to get your pokemon level 100 unless somebody has figured that out since the first couple weeks the game somebody posted something on slack but I haven't had a chance to read it yet is it just delete for what at the time and I apologize if I'm if I'm not up to date with the information but at the time i heard that grinding the Elite Four was the best way to level grinding the elite four with a lucky egg and a rainbow but it was the bean rainbow bean this is what I've heard but I once again there was a document that I didn't read so there may be an even better method than that I think we've talked about this before and I would say that my opinion on the matter hasn't changed that much I like the the fundamental concept of Pokemon having nature's and v's and IVs and abilities and genders and all these variables that can make a single Pokemon extremely unique my problem with it is at the end of the day none of it really matters that much and what I mean by that is ash's greninja for a good exact example the one you get in the demo that you can transfer over to sun and moon i'm pretty sure there was only one nature that people wanted from that thing timid yes i spent about three hours on saturday afternoon this past saturday soft resetting for might timid ash greninja and it's so there's your example and so that's three hours to get a nature that is quote unquote the meta or the best for greninja at the time and maybe it changes you know in in in two years when they you know greninja learns a new move or something meta happens or what not but even so competitive wise it's not it stops making it special and even if you get the if everyone has the timid greninja the clear-cut route there is to get the perfect ivs for it and usually the EV spread is exactly the same and you could argue well you know this is just the most competitive viable greninja at the time and okay sure but that's still that still invalidates all the other possible EV spreads or Ivy's or nature's well not IV is because I guess you can just get perfect ivs on everything once it gets 100 in nature's of that greninja and if it's not this it doesn't matter and that is something we'll was saying well in the email was saying that you know he they never enjoyed breeding tons of boxes of Pokemon just to get one good one or software setting for legendaries and I think that is still a problem in pokemon and I don't know how they solve that obviously or at least it doesn't make sense to get rid of nature's it doesn't make sense to get rid of v's I don't know but at the same time no one's taking advantage of those unique abilities it's not like if if greninja had okay you have a timid greninja that's okay and you have a hasty greninja that's okay okay I could see more of an argument for for you know having these unique nature's but it never comes down to that it only comes out to ok this is lugia this is how these are the nature's you need to get there are no other good possibilities so software a lot of the time there are two that are good do you either want ya to agree but yeah yeah but even still your point stance it's just frustrating and it's not perfect I don't know how they fix that but I don't know I but I I I completely agree I don't know how you fix that my my whole solution back a couple years ago was hey when you go to a tournament why don't you just you know rent let like have a showdown situation where you just pick your Pokemon you pick the nature you pick the moves and call it a day the problem is philosophical because and I would argue that that's central to this issue is the philosophy of the franchise because the reason those elements exist in the first place is so when little Timmy completes his game and he's comparing his team to his friends he notices that Wow his mini or has a higher attack than special attack but Susan's mini or has a higher special attack than attack my mini or is unique mine is different than hers and there's something valuable in that the idea that that Pokemon is yours and the way in which the franchise chooses to do that is through all these systems of nature's v's and IVs and that's pretty cool but when it comes to battling like you mentioned there is often one optimal setup for that Pokemon and if not one then maybe two or in very infrequent circumstances three and that's less cool because then the game just becomes there is one perfect permutation of this Pokemon and everyone is trying to achieve it which is sort of flying in the face of this is perfectly my mini or to continue the example now your mini r is just suboptimal which isn't great for the franchise but because of those same because of that same philosophy that every Pokemon has to be yours they can't completely get rid of the mechanic and I would argue that they're even in a bind competitively for that reason because even though it is not like this they want the competitive scene to look like these are trainers who have built a relationship with their team and they're bringing in their squad of Pokemon that they have a relationship with because that's what the presentation is is all about yeah anyone who plays in VGC knows that's really not the mean there is some extent where you build the team so you feel for it but you're it you engineered those pokemon to be precisely how they are it's not like they were born with quirks and you worked around them you're never gonna do that you're always going to bring whatever the best EV spread or the most like counter meta spread for a lowland marowak that there is and bring that with you and and it's and so it's this weird circumstance of they need it to keep their philosophy that every Pokemon is unique to you alive but at the same time it also necessitates the idea that there is only one perfect version of a Pokemon and that dichotomy is strange to answer the question more directly I would say that I like that the game is making it easier and easier to be able to reach that optimal the version of the Pokemon just for the sake of making it easier to enter competitive play there is though the disillusionment of having it more and more visible how factual it is that there is an optimal permutation of any given Pokemon and that's kind of kind of breaks the fantasy of it does that make sense yeah if I was if I was to make a suggestion or I was to want to see some sort of change in this ecosystem I I would look at two other games that are competitive that I play a lot and I'll just use them as reference and hopefully I won't dwell on it too much but let's take destiny for example let's take clash Royale for example going off what was originally said by Travis in myself you fall into this pattern with Pokemon where one nature maybe another nature is the only nature you want for specific Pokemon and I think that that could be solved in at least one way I'm and I'm not saying it's perfect it's just a suggestion it's just a talking point I think there are what like 20-some nature's already I have a list up here anyways there's there's a ton of nature's what could be done in in the future and this obviously this won't happen but what could be done is you bring down the amount of you still keep all of the nature's but you don't apply all the nature's to a Pokemon so for example instead of Oshawott having 20 nature's Oshawott maybe has only four possible nature's maybe you can only get bold asha watts or timid asha watts or calm asha watts and then maybe quirky asha wats so you know now in this family that these are the four nature's they have and they benefit oshawott in a better way than how 20 nature's would benefit Oshawott and you see something like that destiny where okay this is a gun these are all the possible boring you mentioned destiny these are these are all the possible abilities the rolls the gun can have so for example this gun can have this ability but you won't see that ability on any other gun that being said those abilities are random when you pick up the gun I'll just use an example i have this hand cannon called the palindrome anyone can buy that palindrome that hand cannon has the same role because you buy it from a store vendor but it is possible to get dropped a palindrome with different roles and those roles can be better or worse depending on your play style that being said i have gotten four or five palindromes since then that don't seem better than the palindrome i bought from the vendor irene though got a palindrome with the role i wanted and it's an extremely good gun now you could say well Steve that means that Irene has the advantage on the play field because I have to rely on luck or chance to get that gun and technically in Pokemon you have to rely on luck and chance when you encounter a pokemon of course but you have options around that with breeding but with that being said just because somebody has a better role on a gun doesn't mean that automatically makes them a better player and you see that in Pokemon just because somebody has a team that is to the T meta perfect ivs perfect nature's perfect moves doesn't mean that are automatically going to win it doesn't mean they're better there's still that skill of applying yourself when playing competitive game on the same thing with clash royale somebody can spend more money than me in clash royale and have better cards they can laid out in a level 12 barbarians when my barbarians are only level 10 and by default the level 12 is going to beat the level 10 but that doesn't mean I don't have other cards to try to counter and still have the possibility and the chance to win even though I am at a disadvantage because they spent money and I didn't and I think that that that concept I'm trying to explain is something Pokemon is missing and I think it comes down to they make it very hard or they put a lot of walls up to get a Pokemon with a perfect nature or to get a Pokemon with perfect ivs or perfect v's at the end of the day you can still get there no matter what and in other games you other games are still that luck factor of like okay if I play enough maybe I'll get there and I'm not saying either one is good or bad but I'm saying at least in destiny even though I've played it for you know 1500 hours or whatever I still get excited when i get a palindrome like drop for me and I get super excited I look at it and it might be better it might be worse but it's still that excitement in pokemon i never get that and I should not have that feeling when I encounter a ha lucha in the wild for the first time I should be excited but in the back of my head all I think about is well i'm gonna add it to my pokedex but i know i know i can tell you right now that hawlucha is worthless it probably has the wrong nature it probably has one if I'm lucky one perfect IV I'm gonna have to you know find an area to EV train it and this isn't the correct area so it has to sit my box until I get there because I want to level it up because I don't want to mess up the v's there's so many things that go through your head when you encounter pokemon and none of them is oh man that's a Pokemon I want my party and that's a Pokemon that I want to take a journey with it's always it's always okay that's pokemon for my pok√©dex well I guess I'll braid 200 of them until I get the one I want that's just my thoughts on it I think that's the way you think I can counter at pokemon I'm like oh my gosh that little be guys so cute and then I keep it all the way through the Elite Four and his name is Reuben B I mean I keep I keep all my PO month delayed for because i like it i like the pokemon i catch and used throughout the game and I do form the you know quote unquote bond that Pokemon wants me to form with my team what come what person at a competitive level in the final 32 or the final 64 how many of those people have pokemon that they formed a bond with in in a story sense or an encounter sense and not everyone plays the story in the time how many of those people actually finish the entire story how many of those people have actually bred their own pokemon for themselves versus having somebody else do it and I'm not telling people how to play like if somebody doesn't like the story that's if competitive Pokemon is what brings them to if competitive Pokemon is what brings them to Pokemon and that's what they enjoy the most that's fine Pokemon has always kind of been about discovery and you know that that that chance of getting that chance or surprise of an encounter or a battle or there's like that discovery factor and when when you go down that route of okay I'm just gonna break 200 of them until I get what I want that really takes away from it I don't know maybe I'm looking more for games that like have that surprise factor like you know Fire Emblem heroes or clash royale where you know I open a chest or I I do the stupid orb thing in fire emblem and I you know I get a hero that seems really cool or you know something i wanted and in pokemon when I you know encounter or in Pokemon when you encounter shiny like that is super exciting but when you counter shining in Pokemon that goes back to my original statement of like a month in my back of my head I know okay the shiny is not going to be able to be used for battle it probably doesn't have perfect ivs it probably has the wrong nature it's just gonna sit in a box because I know that Pokemon I encounter in a while they're just not good pokemon sometimes they are sometimes but when you only have like a one in four thousand chance to get a shiny pokemon I don't know what the chances are for like five out of six IVs or what the nature's are for pokemon like one out of twenty four chances to get the nature you want it on the on the slowpoke that you encountered if you're not doing anything to make those chances easier very unlikely yeah if you're not using a synchronizer but hey who just bread fifty Abra's so they have a synchronized her in every nature mr. Will Anderson but but for me I'm not in I'm not into the competitive scene so when when it comes to EV training or IVs or the bottle cap thing I just don't care because I'm never going down that route there's no incentive for me to get a Pokemon to level 100 because anytime you battle somebody there at 50 anyways right and I don't plan on battling anyone it's just not something I really enjoy that much how about you get a Pokemon to level 100 because you love that Pokemon and you want to see it excel in every way that it possibly can okay and do what there's zero content in the game that allows for any use of level 100 Pokemon you travel around and say look at my level 100 chespin have you were to be if you were to say oh there's a couple trainers in this tower that have level 90 and 95 Pokemon and if you can beat them you get this special item okay cool you gave me an incentive you give me a goal to work towards everything does not have to be teleological sometimes you just do things just because that's fair sorry somebody wake up Travis hey sometimes you gotta think outside the box with these I want Pokemon too many were thinking squarely in the box I won't poke my to be the best possible game it can and I don't think right now the systems in place are the best possible systems Alex rights in from Grand Rapids Michigan whoa that's right we're being months ago and I'm very close to you hey spj Travis and will wanted to shout out to Travis as I am currently in my last semester at gvsu and I planted so real University I plan on moving to Grand Rapids very soon also I'm a new listener I found you during your Sun and Moon episodes sorry if these questions have been asked before wait wait can I just can we interrupt this this emailer for what for how many years have I been doing this and not once has somebody from Georgetown University for it but somebody from Sweet Valley High st. na Wey's that's not what it's called and that's not the first time someone has said to me oh I went to or go to grand valley in fact I think I can't remember if it was Jeff who was on season one of Miz ethical our side show I can't remember if he said that he knew someone from grand valley or just someone from Grand Rapids but I think he also knew someone from grand valley there was someone when I was in college who listened to the show and we both went to Grand Valley and then I forgot to ever meet up with that person whoops and now this person so there's a lot of there's a lot of gvsu representation it was a dig at Georgetown University not Grand Valley State University the sweet value you still refuse to call it anything but sweet valley high so it's not the babysitter babysitter Club books well no it's too sweet valley high books but go on a question was what would each of you be as a pokemon type you can determine this via appearance skill etc just not based on your favorite also if the Nintendo switch were to drop a Pokemon game in the future what changes would you be interested in seeing what are your predictions thanks keep up the great content Alex also in parenthesis said that they would be a fire-type from Grand Rapids I think we might have answered this question before but if you were to be a type of pokemon i guess i would be a water type why is it a question because i feel like that's what i've answered in the past and i can't think of anything else I'd want that you have to be consistent with your past selves BB you're today self my today self would say water you sound so disappointed in yourself no I just my today self would be or to do self would be water ah be ice dragon all right dual typing it up when I've answered this in the past I've said ice because i am a cold-hearted individual but because the question master asked her specifically mentioned don't just pick your favorite I shouldn't just pick ice type because ice is my favorite type so instead for fun I'll say something else and this time i will say that i am poison type because I ruin everything I touch so destructive it's not on purpose it's just everything I touch dies I've Nintendo social to drop pokemon game in the future what changes would be interested in seeing alright so let's talk about Evie's IVs and now yeah I got opinions on that what would you be interested in singing in the future I don't know I feel like some days I could think of a request that I would want and now like today I am kind of stuck on the whole EV IV the the one change that the one thing that I would want and this has kind of been a constant that I've said before if you were to ask me this question four years ago or even three years ago I would have said i want it i want a place to store my pokemon so if my cartridge dies said pokemon are safe and that thing happened which is pokemon bank what i would want for my corp a new pokemon game that wouldn't happen with the switch but what I would want is I would want an online-based pokemon game where people can't cheat and hack pokemon and that's what i would want and that won't happen probably ever but just like in like world warcraft or diablo or overwatch I just named three Blizzard games or destiny or any mobile game like Pokemon shuffle or candy crush or clash Royale you cannot cheat and I like that a lot that would by request I would like a Pokemon game with very intuitive UI and a seamless way to trade and battle with friends on the internet buzz words Travis see mother no I'm seamless his only see much would you describe what how much would you describe what what I want without using those words you know what I mean when I said what I would want a forward-thinking digitally enhanced way to commuters invented reality use it oh just going buzzwords off each other ah alright know that were you not satisfied with the UI choices in sun and moon Pokemon has had better UI then sun and moon heartgold and soulsilver is the one that constantly comes up but i would even argue that diamond and pearl has more useful you I there are some confusing choices we've mentioned how literally everyone on the planet didn't didn't that's not true a lot of people didn't know that you could pick up all of the beans by clicking and dragging until they heard that you can do it on this podcast when we told them that that was a possibility the methodology for registering one of the right Pokemon to a d-pad isn't immediately communicated and I didn't understand that until I had already beaten the game and someone told me how to do that um I mean sun and moon doesn't have the worst you i have any pokemon game but it's not the best and you would think that it would at least be as good as an average modern video game and I don't think that Pokemon always even hits that mark and we've already talked about how much more frustrating that festival plaza is to use in comparison to jen's sixes methodology for interacting with friends on the internet well so I would just like to see possibly a move especially with the switch to some sort of like a visual interactive and a move away from menu based interactive him it may be more like a HUD as opposed to a menu system for for doing things kind of more like destiny and Monster Hunters HUD then then what we get with Pokemon where the upper screen is kind of free and clear of all information and and like you know massively online interactive great question we should take another break and when we come back we got a couple more emails at a Pokemon of the week so we'll take a quick break and we will be right back [Music] [Music] and we are back next email here is from coal from New Jersey hey spj and crew I just wanted to say i love the podcast and what you are doing however when will mention that torterra will mention torterra as being a worse starter than Chikorita i instantly had a write-in to tell him how great torterra is if you need a rot if you need a ride somewhere torterra can take you there can send a quill do that not that I don't like cyndaquil however typhlosion is garbage all I'm asking is for you to reconsider your position on Terra Terra will also Travis is the best alright a number one there is a concept oh that's not a terrible I and well I guess I'm not warmed up anymore after playing at the beginning of the show wow that's awesome enjoy that you're playing taps for yourself as your celebration that's not taps amenable it's not even close to this it's the same interval but it's not even close to the same rhythm and taps is not triumphant like that little fanfare is Berber oh well in the universe that we as physical beings inhabit there is no such thing as a perpetual energy device wherein you can basically have unlimited energy to power your machinery without you know some expenditure of fuel but a cyndaquil you give a berry and you get a furnace you could power a freaking car off of the back of a cyndaquil and drive all over lavender town torterra is too big it is a symmetrical because one sides got a tree the other side's got a rock or something dumb like that asymmetrical equals bad and wrong and you're gonna have a real uncomfortable ride because you're either going to be hanging on to that tree as it lumbers along or sitting on a rock and you know how long can you sit on the rock not for very long I'll tell you that cyndaquil powers your car you sitting in luxury you're a Cadillac lap of luxury is wonderful torterra is no Cadillac dude there you go Adam from Ohio writes in probably my guess would be the only Adam in Ohio hey Pokemon podcast crew I am a longtime fan of the show I just wanted to say thanks for all the hours of entertainment that you have given me along the years I started around episode 35 or whenever Travis just started getting involved with the show just wanted to ask everyone's favorite memory of being involved with the show by the way Travis is the best whoa two in a row um you know he picks these PS if I don't that's the thing that the thing is here I do pick the emails but no one ever writes in and says I'm the best we've already gonna do your last we have one person you guys both get Travis and Will are the best like four times in episode no one's favorite character on a TV show is the main character so I see I'll just pick one of us okay all right sure yes I was looking for cities to move in the Midwest after graduating college I was looking at Milwaukee just wondering what your thoughts on the city's pros and cons are so I guess I quite or for me but going no no no no no that's for me pros of Milwaukee has a very nice arts community open very welcoming it has a lot of cute little places you can go to if you're into Harley's obviously that's a big segment of the population there and the weather is mild and comfortable all right what were you saying milwaukee is the worst but I'll get to that favorite memory of the podcast Travis you got one mmm I'll have to think a little longer either of you do you already have your answers all right you guys can think I'll complain about Milwaukee for a second oh wait no I heard I know my answer but I'm not allowed to talk about it because there's a moratorium on talking about the thing that we did oh right yep there's a really cool thing we did this fall aesthetic aunt say but other than that I would a that going to VGC with all the pals was really fun uh but would be my favorite podcast moment so I just think of like of recording in every single time we record it's incredibly uncomfortable my none of my furniture is comfortable and I have to sit in it for hours at a time or I'm sitting on the floor to record which is also very uncomfortable I think maybe when it was episode 100 and i went to let my friends dog out and I went through out the back of his house and the door locked behind me and the way that backyards are in DC you can't I mean if you're in the backyard your stock you didn't and I had to get somebody to get the keys and throw them over of church wall and then just to make it home in time to record episode 100 there you go I don't know if that's a delightful memory but that's memory nonetheless I would say one of my favorite parts of the show would just be recording with some of our guests like gaijin hunter or Austin Creed from WWE or Dan Rikard from giant Bob I think those were just really cool things that I did so back to Adams question about the Midwest and Milwaukee I think Milwaukee is a terrible city personally I've lived here for like twenty six twenty five years of the 28 years I've been alive or something like that Milwaukee has the Brewers and they have the bucks and they have whatever sports that people enjoy and that's really big and so if you're into sports that's that's a draw that Milwaukee brings the other big thing that I would say that will they mention which is probably the biggest draw would be the beer scene of having all these beer brewing companies around Milwaukee and even in the suburbs of Milwaukee like that's a big thing I think kutta hey which is a a smaller city on the south side of Milwaukee has like more bars / any other kind of building in their city there's just bars everywhere in Milwaukee and people i guess like that i don't i don't drink I've said that before I don't care for it I don't go to bars but they exist everywhere and that is what people want to do in Milwaukee and that's cool that's not for me so those are kind of the two big things there is somewhat of an art scene but that's mostly downtown Milwaukee there's not a ton of terrible like there's not a ton of like little shops and unique places that you would think kind of once you've been there once or twice that that's really all there is to it and the these problems or maybe they're not problems maybe you love sports and beer and Milwaukee's the place for you but these these things probably exist in other cities I've been to a lot of other cities I can't say that there's one that stands out as being like my favorite city to be I just don't particularly particularly like Milwaukee I don't like some of the rules and regulations they have at a city level or even a state level but that's that's just me I don't really want to pay an extra thirty dollar pothole tax on my registration license on top of my already a hundred and twenty dollar registration fee just because Milwaukee wants to charge you 30 bucks to fill your potholes and they still don't anyways but that's just me being better and renewing my license last week but my registration why do you choose to live there I choose to live here because Irene has a job that she works at and she likes a lot technically I can work anywhere because I'm salary and I can work remotely so it doesn't matter where I live I can still do my job if I got a different job whether wherever that would be I would move in a heartbeat Wow but if there were no buffalo wild wings where you moved to you know that's a tough call also a big like complaint is that a lot of my really good friends have moved out of Milwaukee to other places and the Baja now you know how I feel I used to be a flab√©b√© and then all my friends left Washington DC and I turned into a cure of Tommy from Columbus Ohio wrightson says the main reason for this emails I wanted to ask if you ever considered doing an interview of youtuber verla safai they make great content on and how-to videos and they have a strong anti-cheating stance when it comes the VGC realm I don't know if you've reached out to them in the past or if you if they wanted to be on your show will admit that they are rather diverse figure in the pokey tuber community but I do really like their content and I would hope that you would give them some thought Tommy I just pulled this email because it was more of a general question upon the youtubers and the other poke people in the pokemon community I don't know if you guys know so um I'm pretty sure the word he was looking for was not diverse but divisive because that's what wrote divisive vs if I is known for for being abrasive and caustic for sometimes possibly no reason other than to raise drama as us gay people like to say I don't know their content I've never watched them I don't watch a lot of pokey youtubers ever guess I've gotten on I am a personal fan of in some aspect or another and so that that is important to me in general though I have lease heard from our slack community that they would want to see more guests on the show that are not youtubers that's saying that we wouldn't or we're stopping having youtubers on the show that's not what I was saying at all I'm just saying that currently I am looking at people outside of the YouTube community and I haven't really focused on the YouTube community not that I spent a lot of time there but I am looking outside of that for now but i don't know i don't know if you guys were big fans of somebody else I mean Travis was a big fan of Griffin and I got Griffin on sure sure right only Travis is mcilroy fans yeah right correct I mean I'm a big fan of Stanley Kubrick can we get Stanley Kubrick on that might be a little more difficult I did I liked Steve's response better who's that only one of the greatest film directors of all time direct all right so like shining about X of 2001 Space Odyssey only if your texts go beyond the grave yep to the Overlook Hotel clockwork orange like the list goes on does it Travis yeah ill against wide shut yeah the list does go on eyes wide shut 2001 a Space Odyssey I'd it's my one yeah there's the really the one like so boring that he got bored making a half way through that's like a biography of someone that I've never seen no taxi driver did you do that one I don't oh never did the 11 film not as your Satan was Pokemon a movie 2000 taxi driver is Scorsese Stanley Kubrick did no pokemon movies yeah we should've held me down stand right up his wheelhouse and yeah but in a bit of great one he could have done the the Victini movie be good of that was there is an alternate universe or Stanley Kubrick directed the Victini movie and it's exactly the same Victini movie that we got with two alternate versions of creates my office one with the restaurant like that's the weird thing about about multiple worlds theory is that not only is every world possible but just very specific ones like that there's a world where Travis's will in Willa's Travis I believe it well no I mean deve this is this is clearly the best of all possible worlds as I think that was live knits who posited that we're in the best of all possible worlds worlds Wilhelm Gottfried Leibniz Gottfried Wilhelm lime debts it's this item this is not philosophy can be lie bets you said that next question final question from Riley from victoria australia in parenthesis not perth i knew that was good hey guys i just i recently started listening during the sun and moon episode and i've been loving it every week everyone on the show adds a positive and unique personality to the show and it only draws you in more kudos to everyone and keep up the good work will is my favorite just FYI well thank you my question is today we had just had the pokemon bank release how do you think that how do you think it will impact the current VGC mehta maybe something like stealth rock Skarmory also what will be what was or will be your first pokemon you bring across from Pokemon bank my favorite was bri loom cheers guys Riley so the in the highest level the effect on the Pokemon meta will be the ability to breed egg moves on to a lowland Pokemon that they previously have not had access to so one of the ones that I've seen as an example in our slack discussions just to bring that up again is so little sizzle Ozil getting out access to fake out as an egg move which it did not have access to before and fake out can be a very powerful move in VGC doubles so there will be other egg moves that will be discovered and will become breedable within the BGC 2017 context that will change up the meta somewhat and i don't think that we've had sufficient time to see how that's going to tumble out yet for what are going to be the top tier teams with these new egg moves but I'm sure somebody has done some predictions and thoughts on it I honestly wouldn't anticipate that much of a difference I also don't believe that the suggestion posited by the email writer will pan out the the idea of skarmory getting more usage because of stealth rock simply because that's kind of the reasons Carm rate doesn't really get used generally in VGC is because entry hazards are not that great in bring four doubles you're not really getting a lot of usage out of them there's less switching and there are fewer Pokemon so it's not as strong as it is in singles so I wouldn't see that at solas all is the one that came to mind for me immediately i'm sure people who know the format in and out would say that there's a much more obvious example but that's the one that came to mind i I mean the game is you know has has changed a little bit in that just as things have have played out like your people are using tabu ley ley and more people believe it or not are using arcanine it's big our canines become the number one most used but I don't think it's gonna be that some pokemon that wasn't even in the the running in terms of frequent usage will suddenly jump into it and for that reason I don't even think so lazl√© will make that much of a difference but now maybe some sort of at least a presence in the meta as opposed to kind of not really being in it although solazzo can ohko a car tana so i don't know what how maybe that's just as cart ama that's not it is it yet is Cortana Cortana is used yeah Cortana um yet master Chang ultimately the 2017 meta is defined by the top booze and the ultra beasts none of those are breathable so opening a Pokemon bank does nothing to change the influence of those pokemon game in the competitive scene I don't think travis has Pokemon bank that's correct so I can answer the second question of what's broken bringing up through it I brought all my pokemon from bank to sun and moon the first ones I brought over were my backs of legendaries most being the special event legendaries that they did all throughout 2016 and my pokemon bank is completely disorganized so I'm just going to dump those suckers in take them out don't matter yeah my firsties mines pretty disorganized too I have some organization I at least have like I have two boxes with legendaries I have then a box of special event Pokemon like my world scraggy the ash Pikachu that you could get for toys from toys r us and then I have a box of Pokemon that were bred for me for VGC competitions that I used in the two years I've competed and then I started organizing pokemon x type like a ghost box of water box obviously one box doesn't hold them all but i started at least organizing what I what I did have I don't know if that's the best way to do it or just do it index number and I am starting to think about what team I'm going to build for my son play through I definitely am ninety-seven percent certain it's gonna have volcarona on it but then the other five I don't know what I'm going to breed for that so why is that funny I don't know that just your volcarona dedication that's all volcarona talonflame get me all the fire types all the fire now I've got a nice cold heart um thank you everyone that wrote in if you have any emails that you want to write in SBJ at pkmn cast com or pokemon podcast calm / contact send us anything or anything anything and/or everything that you want and we will attempt to read it and talk about it thank you to everyone who wrote in today i'm going to toss it over to Travis they're gonna do the Pokemon of the week and then we'll wrap up the show I pretty arbitrarily pick mismagius I like that Pokemon it's not one of my favorites but its Pokemon that I like so I picked it we have two sets from our pokemon of the week select channel this week the first is from frequent contributor actually both these are from frequent contributors the first one comes from kevin AKA Koopa Prez we have a timid nature for Miss majus with 250 2 v's and speed 252 and HP and foreign special attack now that Evie spread should already tip you off that we are doing a sort of fast but with some bulk support set because it we're getting moves we we clearly want speed to be able to do the moves that are going to be on this move set but we want to live more than we really want to be able to deal damage items going to be leftovers the move set is thunder wave taunt hex and paint split we can see there now why that Evie spread is the one we're going to use most of these moves are simply nondamaging moves that are going to hinder the opponent in some way with the notable exception of hex which is a ghost-type move that typically has 65 base power and 100% accuracy but if the opponent is affected by a non-volatile status condition so that's anything that stays if the pokemon switches out and back in if the pokemon is afflicted by one of those status conditions its base power will double to 130 which is very strong especially for a move with 100 base 100% accuracy so the idea there is that even though most of what you're doing is applying paralysis with thunder wave taunt with taunt or dealing kind of dealing sort of weird in direct damage with pain split or healing yourself with pain split you have the ability to deal damage if in instances were like maybe mismagius is the last pokemon alive or if you're just in a spot where throwing another thunder wave out there doesn't really do anything for you you have that option to deal some damage because 130 base power is still strong regardless of how much you've invested in special attack koopa pres also mentions that will-o'-wisp and room are also options the second set comes to us from Gabe Brown and this is very different this is Miss majus with Troy specs so a very offensive SAT choice pax is an item that increases your special attack by 1.5 if memory serves let's see by fifty percent so respects boosts your special attack by fifty percent but makes it so that you can only use the first move you've selected because so the first turn you can use any move out of your four but then after that you have to keep using that move until the Pokemon switches out and back in nature is timid the evo 252 and special attack in 252 and speed the remaining for an HP and the move set is shadow ball mystical fire which is which might be a new one to some people it came out gen-6 but I'll get to it later the Shadow Ball mystical fire power gem and icy wind the Shadow Ball is obviously for the same time attack bonus power gem and icy wind well so power gem is good a type coverage icy wind is a very good move in doubles because it hits both opponents and lowers their speed I'm very strong it doesn't have a high base power but the ability to lower the speed of both opponents by one stage can be very useful it's similar to UM in that way to we were talking about snarl earlier and earlier a week where it's not a very strong move but the fact that it's guaranteed to lower um stat by a full stage of both opponents is quite good and that actually brings us to mystical fire which is very similar to snarl it's a fire-type move that is only learned by Oh what is fennekin evolved into how can I remember don't fox yeah delphox oh that's embarrassing so a mystical fire is only available to Delphic animus majus an interesting combination I suppose but Pokemon to learn it's a fire type move with 75 base power that was lower in generation 6 that was 65 and hurt yeah it was 65 and generation sex bumped up to 75 now 100% accuracy it's guaranteed to lower the Special Attack of the target by one stage it's notable that it's not quite like snarl and that it only hits one opponent but it does have significantly high higher base power so it's less about this throwing a wide net and lowering everything regardless if you know if the intended target switches or whatever your you'll hit something mystical fires is used a little differently but it's has similar effect yeah so those are two sets you have one that's more of a support set and one that's much more offensive perfect perfect we have four shiny version so where I come in shiny mismagius gets like a greenish gold going on instead of the purple pink oh that's not a golden green buddy it's like a Russian hopper no that's more like an organic mulch action it says that's not good looking uh miss megan with a puss screen miss vegas has miss pegasus base HP attack and defense are the same as misdreavus but its base special attack defense and speed are higher mismagius comes before haunch crow in the sinnoh pokedex but mismagius is pre evolution misdreavus comes after honge crows pre evolution murkrow in the Johto pokedex mismagius is based on the concept of mages witch's magic hallucinations and banshees good old ghost pokemon was miss Maggie's the first ghost only pokemon cousin Jen one it was just ghost poison well I the thing about Miss well mystery dias matches right but Miss majus is actually introduced in generation 4 that's the weird thing it's a it was a new evolution in gen 4 to the generation to pokemon mischievous so it's more accurate to say that mischievous was the first yeah that's what I meant to say like that line was the first yeah I think so all right let's uh let's clean some houses let's do some housecleaning first bit of housecleaning is that hopefully by the time you are listening to this or shortly after there should be a new it's super effective shirt up one of those services teespring represent whatever one I decide to do there they're great services because I can put the shirts really cheap you guys can get them for like twenty bucks and then I don't have to worry about shipping them that's like my biggest hassle is in the past I've ordered shirts you know you wait for them to come in yeah then sell them and then you ship them and then you get stuck with a bunch of leftovers because you think medium is the most popular and no one buys medium then you get all these mediums left over anyways there should be some new shirts if you're interested I try to price them as cheap as possible I don't look to make profits on the shirts I think the last time I sent out a shirt i made like twelve dollars after everything was said and done so I you know that gives me like four bottles of Soylent so there should be some new shirts up so if follow our Twitter or follow slack if you're in slack or follow our Facebook to keep up on those Twitter a Pokemon podcast facebook.com slash pkmn cast like I mentioned our slack if you want access into that you have to become a patreon backer patreon com it's super effective for
