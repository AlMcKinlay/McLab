[Music] (0:04 - 0:18)
what's up everyone welcome to the 250 (0:20 - 0:27)
second episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:24 - 0:32)
i'm your host SP j it's super effective (0:27 - 0:34)
i forgot to say that we are in (0:32 - 0:38)
generation 3 of this show I suppose I (0:34 - 0:40)
guess that's something that we've (0:38 - 0:44)
accomplished with me today I have will I (0:40 - 0:46)
was just going to have a drink of water (0:44 - 0:47)
now that you mentioned that we're in (0:46 - 0:53)
generation and that uh that cunning (0:47 - 0:55)
delightful laughs you heard is from (0:53 - 1:03)
Travis I guess he does play the trumpet (0:55 - 1:07)
did she I didn't audio edit that in that (1:03 - 1:09)
is Travis playing the trumpet and let's (1:07 - 1:12)
Travis as a sound board over there no no (1:09 - 1:14)
no it was making it can you figure out (1:12 - 1:16)
why I'm playing the trumpet I remember I (1:14 - 1:19)
remember the comment last week yeah yeah (1:16 - 1:20)
yeah that's that's reason one can you (1:19 - 1:22)
remember the real reason reason to why (1:20 - 1:25)
this episode of all episodes cuz we've (1:22 - 1:28)
started gen 3 is that it yeah and what (1:25 - 1:33)
about gen 3 there's a lot of horns hey (1:28 - 1:37)
that's it I love how you are both you (1:33 - 1:39)
were both there's like a lot of like (1:37 - 1:41)
horns and trumpets and the music when (1:39 - 1:44)
when people make fun of gin threes music (1:41 - 1:46)
they say all the trumpets right and (1:44 - 1:49)
because the soundfont of generation 3 is (1:46 - 1:51)
very different than the previous games (1:49 - 1:54)
and has a lot of synthesized horns in it (1:51 - 1:57)
so that's the joke Wow both prepared (1:54 - 2:02)
with gen 3 jokes hey I was just now I'm (1:57 - 2:04)
thinking of an embossed cuz that an (2:02 - 2:06)
embosser city soundtrack is all brass (2:04 - 2:09)
but whatever nothing but your idea is (2:06 - 2:12)
what started all that though well we got (2:09 - 2:14)
a show for you guys today pretty (2:12 - 2:16)
straightforward we got a little bit of (2:14 - 2:18)
pokemon news and then I pulled some (2:16 - 2:20)
emails and then travis has their pic for (2:18 - 2:23)
Pokemon of the week and then what will (2:20 - 2:25)
what will happen is probably all that (2:23 - 2:27)
stuff will be drawn out like it always (2:25 - 2:29)
is because we ramble especially when it (2:27 - 2:30)
comes to emails but that's okay I think (2:29 - 2:32)
it'll be a great show regardless but (2:30 - 2:33)
before we get to the (2:32 - 2:35)
Monday's before we get to the emails (2:33 - 2:39)
what is new with you two well I got some (2:35 - 2:41)
really exciting news yeah let's hear I (2:39 - 2:44)
ready for it uh-huh well okay I mean you (2:41 - 2:45)
guys you guys both know I went to the (2:44 - 2:49)
doctor yesterday right yep and after an (2:45 - 2:52)
extremely thorough investigation (2:49 - 2:58)
examination with high res 4k digital (2:52 - 3:02)
photography there is in controvert able (2:58 - 3:07)
proof that my head is nowhere near up my (3:02 - 3:15)
butt so so for anybody who ever thought (3:07 - 3:18)
that will anderson had his head firmly (3:15 - 3:21)
up his own but i can get you copies of (3:18 - 3:25)
those photos to show it Julian and clear (3:21 - 3:27)
good that's a really good joke and I'm (3:25 - 3:30)
also glad that there was nothing of (3:27 - 3:33)
concern oh yeah no cancer either yay (3:30 - 3:37)
glad Willis was safe and secure from the (3:33 - 3:40)
doctor Travis what about what about you (3:37 - 3:43)
well I just got back today from watching (3:40 - 3:47)
John wick chapter 2 had I seen John wick (3:43 - 3:51)
chapter one no I had not but I knew one (3:47 - 3:54)
thing don't set him off all right what's (3:51 - 3:56)
what's your the tat that's the tagline (3:54 - 3:59)
for John wick the first one would be do (3:56 - 4:02)
you see the the video where they edited (3:59 - 4:04)
it so that instead of him goin nuts it (4:02 - 4:08)
was his dog oh it's incredible yes sweet (4:04 - 4:11)
hahaha what's your 10 second movie (4:08 - 4:14)
review was it worth seeing the second (4:11 - 4:18)
John wick it is a very hmm it is an (4:14 - 4:20)
action movie it is good at being an (4:18 - 4:23)
action movie it is little else but hey (4:20 - 4:24)
it's not really trying to be that much (4:23 - 4:27)
else and sometimes it actually becomes a (4:24 - 4:29)
little bit more but rarely but if you (4:27 - 4:31)
just want a good action movie it's (4:29 - 4:33)
pretty good do you think that without (4:31 - 4:34)
seeing the first one do you think the (4:33 - 4:39)
first one is probably better oh wait i (4:34 - 4:41)
just heard that question in my ears and (4:39 - 4:43)
then my brain heard it and it was like (4:41 - 4:47)
without having seen her so i think (4:43 - 4:50)
is but yes in my perfect imagination is (4:47 - 4:53)
the personal I was like on par with the (4:50 - 4:56)
greatest films of the 21st century that (4:53 - 4:59)
I think I I think that is a really (4:56 - 5:01)
interesting question because it poses (4:59 - 5:07)
whether I think John wick to is a good (5:01 - 5:09)
sequel to a film I haven't seen like (5:07 - 5:12)
does John wick to deliver on all of the (5:09 - 5:14)
same levels that we've come to expect (5:12 - 5:16)
for the John wick franchise that I have (5:14 - 5:18)
not seen and I think that's an (5:16 - 5:19)
interesting question i would probably (5:18 - 5:22)
say that the first one is probably (5:19 - 5:24)
people are probably gonna like the first (5:22 - 5:26)
one more i would imagine that the first (5:24 - 5:28)
one is a little more focused a little (5:26 - 5:30)
less sprawling than his John wick (5:28 - 5:32)
chapter 2 but again I have not seen John (5:30 - 5:34)
wick the chapter one so it's probably a (5:32 - 5:37)
circumstance like the godfather 2 & (5:34 - 5:39)
Aliens where the second the sequel is (5:37 - 5:41)
actually better than the first movie I (5:39 - 5:43)
thought you were suggesting the aliens (5:41 - 5:47)
was a sequel to The Godfather too so uh (5:43 - 5:49)
you know they they really stretched it (5:47 - 5:51)
out with godfather to aliens but I think (5:49 - 5:53)
they made it work game over man game (5:51 - 5:56)
over the last 15 minutes that movie (5:53 - 5:58)
really of aliens really ties back to the (5:56 - 6:01)
Godfather no I I asked that because a (5:58 - 6:03)
lot of times sequels never live up to (6:01 - 6:06)
the original so I was just curious for (6:03 - 6:10)
seeing a sequel if that sequel was (6:06 - 6:12)
enjoyable I I enjoyed myself yeah (6:10 - 6:16)
although yeah aliens and aliens and (6:12 - 6:18)
Godfather Part 2 along with I would (6:16 - 6:20)
argue the Empire Strikes Back are all (6:18 - 6:22)
examples of sequels that are better on (6:20 - 6:25)
the first film so there are some (6:22 - 6:27)
examples toy story 2 was a pretty good (6:25 - 6:29)
sequel but i would say that toy story 3 (6:27 - 6:31)
is the best out of all of them I would (6:29 - 6:34)
concur and i would say space Jumanji was (6:31 - 6:38)
much better than original juba that's a (6:34 - 6:40)
that's a that's a deep cut for a long (6:38 - 6:43)
time listener I forgot we ever talking (6:40 - 6:46)
about space Jumanji oh man alright cool (6:43 - 6:48)
John wick too I guess go see it would (6:46 - 6:50)
weigh ok I guess the last wish to set (6:48 - 6:53)
him off ok wait don't wait I got one (6:50 - 6:54)
question before you asked you asked (6:53 - 6:56)
questions so yeah sure all right did you (6:54 - 6:58)
have to wear a costume since you (6:56 - 7:00)
obviously had to go to not the MU (6:58 - 7:02)
Theater you work at to see this film (7:00 - 7:05)
dude like trench coat sunglasses and a (7:02 - 7:08)
big hat so that your fellow theater (7:05 - 7:11)
workers didn't know you're going to the (7:08 - 7:15)
popular theater here so here well yeah (7:11 - 7:17)
so here's the interesting thing one of (7:15 - 7:19)
my good friends from my hometown where (7:17 - 7:23)
I'm currently living before for a few (7:19 - 7:25)
months before i moved to winnipeg by a (7:23 - 7:27)
few it's probably gonna end up being (7:25 - 7:30)
about six but anyway one of my friends (7:27 - 7:32)
from high school and I'm you know still (7:30 - 7:35)
friends with works at the theater that (7:32 - 7:37)
works for the theater chain that's the (7:35 - 7:41)
larger conglomerate in the region so (7:37 - 7:42)
there's an interesting dynamic there (7:41 - 7:44)
where I work at the small local theater (7:42 - 7:47)
and he's a like I think he's (7:44 - 7:50)
rejectionist at the larger chain so (7:47 - 7:52)
there's a bit of a you've got mail (7:50 - 7:53)
scenario except that we're not (7:52 - 7:56)
romantically involved so we went so he (7:53 - 7:58)
got us in free because he works there (7:56 - 8:01)
and I didn't want to go see it at the (7:58 - 8:03)
place I work cuz I didn't want to go to (8:01 - 8:06)
work to watch a movie sure but also why (8:03 - 8:08)
does your indie theatre show John wick (8:06 - 8:11)
to it is interested what I say in D (8:08 - 8:13)
because that's what I knew it as when I (8:11 - 8:16)
was a kid I and and in high school (8:13 - 8:20)
because they played they were relied on (8:16 - 8:22)
independent and foreign films but their (8:20 - 8:25)
head Travis was younger now and he wrote (8:22 - 8:28)
in to the podcast and we plan on a (8:25 - 8:31)
radially email that he wrote it no I'm (8:28 - 8:33)
just kidding we're not reading at this (8:31 - 8:37)
episode so that's when I was a ute in in (8:33 - 8:39)
DC and we used to have many more movie (8:37 - 8:41)
theaters that's the one we would have (8:39 - 8:44)
called the adult theater I believe No (8:41 - 8:46)
haha alright what was your notion (8:44 - 8:49)
steve-o my question was was it worth the (8:46 - 8:51)
theatre price but Travis got in for free (8:49 - 8:53)
I knowed it was certainly worth it for (8:51 - 8:55)
me I was just saying is it worth seeing (8:53 - 8:57)
in theatres or do you feel like this (8:55 - 9:00)
could be a weight for weight for VHS or (8:57 - 9:03)
you know Betamax while there are well (9:00 - 9:05)
there's a lot that the film does (9:03 - 9:09)
visually to make you go oh (9:05 - 9:09)
really did that um I wouldn't say that (9:10 - 9:16)
it's like visually stunning in the sense (9:13 - 9:17)
of a film where like if you're not (9:16 - 9:21)
seeing it in in the full format you're (9:17 - 9:23)
not really like yeah you can just wait (9:21 - 9:25)
for it to be on streaming whatever it's (9:23 - 9:28)
funny because I talked about John wick (9:25 - 9:31)
to today on that friends podcast which (9:28 - 9:33)
will go up in a bit there's only a few (9:31 - 9:34)
episodes of that show so far it's called (9:33 - 9:36)
port of dorks I don't know when that (9:34 - 9:38)
episode that I guessed it on to talk (9:36 - 9:40)
about John wick to is going to be but (9:38 - 9:41)
i'll be on there talking about John wick (9:40 - 9:43)
2 i'm talking about John wick to as a (9:41 - 9:46)
joke here on this podcast and I'm gonna (9:43 - 9:47)
talk about John wick to you on the (9:46 - 9:49)
arbitrary archives so I'm just I'm (9:47 - 9:52)
really spreading the gospel of Keanu (9:49 - 9:55)
across all of my channel he's selling (9:52 - 9:56)
tickets left and right to this movie (9:55 - 9:59)
which is funny because i'm not i'm just (9:56 - 10:01)
obsessed with the idea of John wick to (9:59 - 10:05)
more than i am the actual film i feel ya (10:01 - 10:08)
all right don't set him off with that (10:05 - 10:10)
being said let's jump into some pokemon (10:08 - 10:14)
news not a lot of news this week but (10:10 - 10:15)
we'll start off with the first one (10:14 - 10:18)
pokemon duel update version 3.0 point (10:15 - 10:22)
one that came out on februari ninth i (10:18 - 10:24)
believe pokemon doulas received a small (10:22 - 10:27)
update to fix some minor bugs this patch (10:24 - 10:29)
will upgrade the version and it requires (10:27 - 10:33)
163 megabytes to install nothing really (10:29 - 10:36)
stating what it did Travis are you still (10:33 - 10:38)
dueling are you still Pokemon dueling I (10:36 - 10:41)
will admit I've been playing it less now (10:38 - 10:43)
that I've been playing the fire emblem (10:41 - 10:46)
iOS game which I'm having more fun with (10:43 - 10:50)
oh whoa ah we brought a Pokemon because (10:46 - 10:52)
it's a Pokemon show but I want to hear (10:50 - 10:54)
your thoughts on the fire emblem game (10:52 - 10:55)
and I want mostly because I want you to (10:54 - 10:57)
you know compare it because what i (10:55 - 10:59)
originally said is i believed that (10:57 - 11:02)
pokémon duel and Fire Emblem Duke it (10:59 - 11:04)
kind of the same core target audience (11:02 - 11:06)
and strategy games they are both (11:04 - 11:08)
top-down strategy games where you're (11:06 - 11:13)
controlling a set of four or so it's (11:08 - 11:14)
more in Pokemon duel but just for the (11:13 - 11:17)
sake of it four or so pieces that you (11:14 - 11:21)
move around a grid or battling purposes (11:17 - 11:23)
but I would say that that's where the (11:21 - 11:26)
similarities and someone I was talking (11:23 - 11:28)
to a Pokemon duel described it as a (11:26 - 11:31)
little feeling a little more like more (11:28 - 11:33)
akin to chess or something like that (11:31 - 11:35)
where it's a lot about movement of (11:33 - 11:37)
pieces which is important in Fire Emblem (11:35 - 11:40)
as well but the I would say they are (11:37 - 11:42)
kind of different games that there well (11:40 - 11:44)
not kind of they are significantly (11:42 - 11:45)
different games even though they're both (11:44 - 11:48)
strategy games I'll still play pokemon (11:45 - 11:50)
duel probably just about like once a day (11:48 - 11:52)
to get a login bonus and play a match or (11:50 - 11:55)
two but I have been investing more time (11:52 - 11:58)
into fire emblem and your first fire (11:55 - 12:01)
emblem game right yeah what are your (11:58 - 12:04)
impressions without playing any fire (12:01 - 12:06)
emblem game in the series would you say (12:04 - 12:10)
that this is the best I mean I think (12:06 - 12:12)
it's very clear that they've done down a (12:10 - 12:18)
lot of them again I like it I've always (12:12 - 12:21)
been a fan of the line I'm tackling that (12:18 - 12:23)
right there yeah I've always been a fan (12:21 - 12:25)
of the final fantasy tactics franchise (12:23 - 12:28)
so this is very similar although it (12:25 - 12:30)
doesn't have what I would argue is the (12:28 - 12:32)
best part of final fantasy tactics which (12:30 - 12:35)
is the robust job system but it's (12:32 - 12:40)
similar and enjoyable yeah I don't have (12:35 - 12:42)
a lot to say about the fire emblem (12:40 - 12:45)
heroes game other than it's pretty fun (12:42 - 12:48)
and the fan service is really troubling (12:45 - 12:51)
but you know whatever yeah you take what (12:48 - 12:56)
you can get ready I guess yeah well you (12:51 - 12:57)
are you did you play duel you're (12:56 - 12:59)
boycotting fire emblem okay not been (12:57 - 13:01)
playing any of that no duel for you nope (12:59 - 13:04)
all right although I should I well okay (13:01 - 13:06)
so here's the problem I'm at the point (13:04 - 13:09)
in Pokemon picross where the only stages (13:06 - 13:11)
i haven't crowned yet are the ones that (13:09 - 13:13)
are only used time skills which (13:11 - 13:15)
basically means you get no assistance on (13:13 - 13:17)
determining which squares need to be (13:15 - 13:19)
filled and which squares need to be left (13:17 - 13:22)
empty and since i only a lot about seven (13:19 - 13:24)
minutes for pokemon picross every day (13:22 - 13:26)
it's really hard for me to do those ones (13:24 - 13:30)
so i might just be primed to pick up (13:26 - 13:32)
dual as my daily seven minute routine (13:30 - 13:36)
yeah after i saw or that amount of time (13:32 - 13:38)
it after I saw the update I'm now more (13:36 - 13:40)
more willing to give it a shot now that (13:38 - 13:43)
it seems to you they seem to be starting (13:40 - 13:45)
to fix things with it not that I heard (13:43 - 13:47)
like clearly the game works people are (13:45 - 13:49)
playing it but I just I've heard from (13:47 - 13:51)
people I trust that it's just and I've (13:49 - 13:53)
said this before slow sluggish and (13:51 - 13:55)
whatnot and I don't have a lot of (13:53 - 13:57)
patience when it comes to that next bit (13:55 - 13:59)
of news here is the wait is over Sun and (13:57 - 14:02)

does it still crash I don't know I (15:50 - 15:54)
haven't tested it since I'd be lying if (15:52 - 15:57)
I said I I've been playing pokemon go go (15:54 - 16:00)
but like Travis said it's it's way too (15:57 - 16:03)
cold outside it's like 22 degrees here (16:00 - 16:05)
Wisconsin I mean it's not that much (16:03 - 16:08)
warmer here so I don't want to hear it (16:05 - 16:11)

available in Japan via 7 spot and (16:36 - 16:43)
7-eleven stores and it will be at a (16:40 - 16:45)
couple other stores that I cannot (16:43 - 16:48)
pronounce via the 3ds stations at the (16:45 - 16:51)
store the stores operate and will also (16:48 - 16:52)
be available at pokemon center stores (16:51 - 16:55)
the Machamp will be level 34 have the (16:52 - 16:58)
ability guts have no held item and we'll (16:55 - 17:00)
know the moves double-edged bulk up (16:58 - 17:03)
strength quick guard and its original (17:00 - 17:07)
chant trainer will be Yoshida and it (17:03 - 17:09)
will be featured in a cherish ball so (17:07 - 17:11)
there you go that's pretty cool also jet (17:09 - 17:13)
Japan has 7 11 s that's pretty sweet and (17:11 - 17:16)
apparently a pan is the land of the (17:13 - 17:19)
7-eleven you know nothing of Japan set (17:16 - 17:22)
their the land day of the 7-eleven they (17:19 - 17:26)
love convenience stores oh I know that (17:22 - 17:29)
but like 7-eleven disturbing is the king (17:26 - 17:30)
of the convenience store they didn't (17:29 - 17:31)
start in japan though that's what you (17:30 - 17:33)
made it seem like they started in texas (17:31 - 17:36)
but trust me that sounds me there's (17:33 - 17:38)
anything I've learned about Japan as (17:36 - 17:40)
they love convenience stores I'm down (17:38 - 17:41)
with a good convenience store we have a (17:40 - 17:44)
we have like one 7-eleven in Milwaukee I (17:41 - 17:47)
drove past it today closed board it up (17:44 - 17:50)
completely shut down so I don't know I'm (17:47 - 17:52)
gonna do in July eleventh when it's free (17:50 - 17:54)
slurpee day (17:52 - 18:00)
go to show so now it's 70 bro rough (17:54 - 18:03)
there no I think it's really good (18:00 - 18:05)
because of why 7-eleven is called (18:03 - 18:08)
7-eleven when I called 7 11 cuz it was (18:05 - 18:11)
when it originally opened it was open 11 (18:08 - 18:14)
hours a day 7 days a week isn't that I (18:11 - 18:18)
think that's our suspicions yes so seven (18:14 - 18:21)
hours 7 0 7 days a week 11 hours a day I (18:18 - 18:23)
thought that's why it was called (18:21 - 18:25)
7-eleven okay I suppose that make sense (18:23 - 18:31)
so I think my joke was was very erudite (18:25 - 18:34)
very uh it was a thinker um which might (18:31 - 18:37)
have flown over the heads of gross yeah (18:34 - 18:44)
I understand GTS updates the most used (18:37 - 18:47)
pokemon in pokemon refresh is still in (18:44 - 18:50)

crew Travis you have no idea the monster (22:40 - 22:53)
magic lore has become hahahahahahahahaha (22:45 - 23:01)
chick has grown to the point where time (22:53 - 23:03)
imagine gathering and the word monster (23:01 - 23:05)
before could also be supplemented for (23:03 - 23:09)
like gigantic or huger I know without (23:05 - 23:12)
seeing the words that might not have (23:09 - 23:15)
made sense maybe it did maybe I'm just (23:12 - 23:17)
ran no I think it made perfect sense (23:15 - 23:19)
okay cut it out cut it out cut it out (23:17 - 23:22)
magic has grown to the point where there (23:19 - 23:25)
there's more lure added every week sets (23:22 - 23:27)
come out every three months each with (23:25 - 23:31)
its own world and lure that explored (23:27 - 23:34)
leading up to and after the set is (23:31 - 23:36)
released there's also two or three (23:34 - 23:38)
supplemental products each year that (23:36 - 23:41)
have that our own lower around them some (23:38 - 23:43)
of them have entire sets in addition to (23:41 - 23:46)
the main for each year and others are (23:43 - 23:48)
pre constructed decks that expand on old (23:46 - 23:51)
characters and introduce new ones it's (23:48 - 23:52)
actually gotten pretty crazy to keep up (23:51 - 23:55)
with to keep up with it as much as I can (23:52 - 23:58)
and it's only growing also yes Jase is a (23:55 - 24:00)
character and there are several angels (23:58 - 24:03)
question for all of you all right now (24:00 - 24:04)
under the pokemon stuff we'll just (24:03 - 24:07)
wanted to clear up the magic lore I just (24:04 - 24:10)
I guess I apologize for assuming there (24:07 - 24:13)
that magic Laura was only released at (24:10 - 24:15)
such a frequency that you could (24:13 - 24:18)
theoretically just backlog a lot of (24:15 - 24:20)
episodes and release them I apologize (24:18 - 24:22)
for that in some assumption about the (24:20 - 24:23)
amount of things that wizards of the (24:22 - 24:27)
coast is saying about yog moth see I no (24:23 - 24:29)
more magic things than I didn't know at (24:27 - 24:31)
the top of my head last week so I've (24:29 - 24:32)
been thinking about the things I know (24:31 - 24:34)
about magic and about a week in case (24:32 - 24:36)
this came up again yog mwah that's (24:34 - 24:39)
another name Black Lotus now Black Lotus (24:36 - 24:41)
is not a character Black Lotus is a card (24:39 - 24:43)
from the original set of the game that (24:41 - 24:47)
was too broken and therefore it costs a (24:43 - 24:50)
lot of money but it's not it's illegal (24:47 - 24:52)
to use it illegal it's not against the (24:50 - 24:56)
law you get arrested yeah uh yeah can (24:52 - 24:59)
you pull over uh ma'am is that up (24:56 - 25:01)
instead of black lotus in your passenger (24:59 - 25:05)
seat is it is that a Miss is that a deck (25:01 - 25:08)
of magic cards that you have there I'm (25:05 - 25:09)
gonna I'm gonna have to see your deck I (25:08 - 25:12)
think I see a time walk the feud cards (25:09 - 25:14)
down miss can I ask you where you got (25:12 - 25:17)
this Black Lotus he is met Mina's I (25:14 - 25:19)
actually play TCG's diamond are (25:17 - 25:22)
participating in this combat hahahahaha (25:19 - 25:24)
a question for all of you this is still (25:22 - 25:26)
from will by the way what do you think (25:24 - 25:29)
about the current methods of attaining (25:26 - 25:32)
heavily viable Pokemon game freak keeps (25:29 - 25:34)
adding new features with every release (25:32 - 25:37)
that makes the getting perfect ivs EV (25:34 - 25:39)
training and leveling easier they also (25:37 - 25:41)
take away features too as we come to (25:39 - 25:44)
expect I've never never liked that you (25:41 - 25:46)
had to breed boxes worth of Pokemon to (25:44 - 25:48)
get a single good one or having to soft (25:46 - 25:50)
reset legendaries to get a specific (25:48 - 25:53)
hidden power type it took me hours of (25:50 - 25:55)
software setting both top of cocoa and (25:53 - 25:58)
tabu ley ley to get them with HP fire (25:55 - 26:01)
hidden power fire though part of it may (25:58 - 26:02)
have to do with my compulsion to catch (26:01 - 26:05)
everything in premiere balls exclusively (26:02 - 26:08)
I don't know if I would want it to be (26:05 - 26:10)
easy as something like pokemon showdown (26:08 - 26:12)
where everything's available to you but (26:10 - 26:15)
what you have to do is still boring and (26:12 - 26:18)
tedious love the show but everyone but (26:15 - 26:21)
will hands down is my favorite this is (26:18 - 26:24)
no way influenced by him having the same (26:21 - 26:26)
name as me Steve I could take her leave (26:24 - 26:28)
will from Indiana haha that was kind of (26:26 - 26:30)
a confusing ending does he like me or (26:28 - 26:33)
does he not like me will hands down as (26:30 - 26:35)
my favorite oh okay I think you left out (26:33 - 26:37)
the hands down part oh maybe I did my (26:35 - 26:44)
mistake now I'm i like the changes i (26:37 - 26:46)
because i mean if you do notice there (26:44 - 26:49)
has been a trade-off that yes it's now (26:46 - 26:52)
much easier to get perfect ivs without (26:49 - 26:54)
having to breed breed breed till the end (26:52 - 26:58)
of days to get perfect ivs or to get a (26:54 - 27:01)
mysterious 6iv ditto from japan like (26:58 - 27:05)
everybody seems to have the same one but (27:01 - 27:08)
it they've made it now much harder to (27:05 - 27:10)
get your Pokemon up to level 100 which (27:08 - 27:13)
they have to be in order to use bottle (27:10 - 27:17)
caps to get their IVs improved but think (27:13 - 27:20)
about it this way when you're getting (27:17 - 27:22)
one Pokemon up to level 100 you are (27:20 - 27:23)
focusing all the work on that one (27:22 - 27:25)
Pokemon and not just aimlessly (27:23 - 27:28)
generating eggs and trying to get the (27:25 - 27:30)
eggs to have the right IVs does that (27:28 - 27:32)
make sense am I saying something real (27:30 - 27:36)
here ya know it does also in sun and (27:32 - 27:38)
moon there's no good place to get your (27:36 - 27:40)
pokemon level 100 unless somebody has (27:38 - 27:42)
figured that out since the first couple (27:40 - 27:43)
weeks (27:42 - 27:45)
the game somebody posted something on (27:43 - 27:46)
slack but I haven't had a chance to read (27:45 - 27:48)
it yet is it just delete for what at the (27:46 - 27:51)
time and I apologize if I'm if I'm not (27:48 - 27:52)
up to date with the information but at (27:51 - 27:55)
the time i heard that grinding the Elite (27:52 - 27:57)
Four was the best way to level grinding (27:55 - 27:58)
the elite four with a lucky egg and a (27:57 - 28:01)
rainbow but it was the bean rainbow bean (27:58 - 28:04)
this is what I've heard but I once again (28:01 - 28:06)
there was a document that I didn't read (28:04 - 28:07)
so there may be an even better method (28:06 - 28:09)
than that I think we've talked about (28:07 - 28:11)
this before and I would say that my (28:09 - 28:13)
opinion on the matter hasn't changed (28:11 - 28:17)
that much I like the the fundamental (28:13 - 28:20)
concept of Pokemon having nature's and (28:17 - 28:27)
v's and IVs and abilities and genders (28:20 - 28:30)
and all these variables that can make a (28:27 - 28:33)
single Pokemon extremely unique my (28:30 - 28:35)
problem with it is at the end of the day (28:33 - 28:38)
none of it really matters that much and (28:35 - 28:41)
what I mean by that is ash's greninja (28:38 - 28:44)
for a good exact example the one you get (28:41 - 28:46)
in the demo that you can transfer over (28:44 - 28:48)
to sun and moon i'm pretty sure there (28:46 - 28:51)
was only one nature that people wanted (28:48 - 28:54)
from that thing timid yes i spent about (28:51 - 28:56)
three hours on saturday afternoon this (28:54 - 28:58)
past saturday soft resetting for might (28:56 - 29:02)
timid ash greninja and it's so there's (28:58 - 29:05)
your example and so that's three hours (29:02 - 29:08)
to get a nature that is quote unquote (29:05 - 29:11)
the meta or the best for greninja at the (29:08 - 29:14)
time and maybe it changes you know in in (29:11 - 29:17)
in two years when they you know greninja (29:14 - 29:19)
learns a new move or something meta (29:17 - 29:21)
happens or what not but even so (29:19 - 29:24)
competitive wise it's not it stops (29:21 - 29:27)
making it special and even if you get (29:24 - 29:30)
the if everyone has the timid greninja (29:27 - 29:33)
the clear-cut route there is to get the (29:30 - 29:36)
perfect ivs for it and usually the EV (29:33 - 29:39)
spread is exactly the same and you could (29:36 - 29:40)
argue well you know this is just the (29:39 - 29:43)
most competitive viable greninja at the (29:40 - 29:47)
time and okay sure but that's still that (29:43 - 29:52)
still invalidates all the other possible (29:47 - 29:56)
EV spreads or Ivy's or nature's (29:52 - 29:58)
well not IV is because I guess you can (29:56 - 30:00)
just get perfect ivs on everything once (29:58 - 30:03)
it gets 100 in nature's of that greninja (30:00 - 30:06)
and if it's not this it doesn't matter (30:03 - 30:08)
and that is something we'll was saying (30:06 - 30:11)
well in the email was saying that you (30:08 - 30:14)
know he they never enjoyed breeding tons (30:11 - 30:16)
of boxes of Pokemon just to get one good (30:14 - 30:18)
one or software setting for legendaries (30:16 - 30:22)
and I think that is still a problem in (30:18 - 30:24)
pokemon and I don't know how they solve (30:22 - 30:27)
that obviously or at least it doesn't (30:24 - 30:28)
make sense to get rid of nature's it (30:27 - 30:32)
doesn't make sense to get rid of v's I (30:28 - 30:34)
don't know but at the same time no one's (30:32 - 30:36)
taking advantage of those unique (30:34 - 30:39)
abilities it's not like if if greninja (30:36 - 30:41)
had okay you have a timid greninja (30:39 - 30:43)
that's okay and you have a hasty (30:41 - 30:45)
greninja that's okay okay I could see (30:43 - 30:47)
more of an argument for for you know (30:45 - 30:49)
having these unique nature's but it (30:47 - 30:51)
never comes down to that it only comes (30:49 - 30:53)
out to ok this is lugia this is how (30:51 - 30:55)
these are the nature's you need to get (30:53 - 30:58)
there are no other good possibilities so (30:55 - 31:00)
software a lot of the time there are two (30:58 - 31:03)
that are good do you either want ya to (31:00 - 31:06)
agree but yeah yeah but even still your (31:03 - 31:08)
point stance it's just frustrating and (31:06 - 31:10)
it's not perfect I don't know how they (31:08 - 31:14)
fix that but I don't know I but I I I (31:10 - 31:15)
completely agree I don't know how you (31:14 - 31:17)
fix that my my whole solution back a (31:15 - 31:19)
couple years ago was hey when you go to (31:17 - 31:21)
a tournament why don't you just you know (31:19 - 31:24)
rent let like have a showdown situation (31:21 - 31:26)
where you just pick your Pokemon you (31:24 - 31:28)
pick the nature you pick the moves and (31:26 - 31:31)
call it a day the problem is (31:28 - 31:34)
philosophical because and I would argue (31:31 - 31:37)
that that's central to this issue is the (31:34 - 31:39)
philosophy of the franchise because the (31:37 - 31:43)
reason those elements exist in the first (31:39 - 31:47)
place is so when little Timmy completes (31:43 - 31:50)
his game and he's comparing his team to (31:47 - 31:56)
his friends he notices that Wow his mini (31:50 - 31:59)
or has a higher attack than special (31:56 - 32:02)
attack but Susan's mini or has a higher (31:59 - 32:04)
special attack than attack my mini or is (32:02 - 32:08)
unique mine is different than hers and (32:04 - 32:10)
there's something valuable in that (32:08 - 32:13)
the idea that that Pokemon is yours and (32:10 - 32:16)
the way in which the franchise chooses (32:13 - 32:18)
to do that is through all these systems (32:16 - 32:23)
of nature's v's and IVs and that's (32:18 - 32:25)
pretty cool but when it comes to (32:23 - 32:28)
battling like you mentioned there is (32:25 - 32:32)
often one optimal setup for that Pokemon (32:28 - 32:37)
and if not one then maybe two or in very (32:32 - 32:39)
infrequent circumstances three and (32:37 - 32:42)
that's less cool because then the game (32:39 - 32:45)
just becomes there is one perfect (32:42 - 32:47)
permutation of this Pokemon and everyone (32:45 - 32:48)
is trying to achieve it which is sort of (32:47 - 32:50)
flying in the face of this is perfectly (32:48 - 32:55)
my mini or to continue the example now (32:50 - 32:58)
your mini r is just suboptimal which (32:55 - 33:01)
isn't great for the franchise but (32:58 - 33:03)
because of those same because of that (33:01 - 33:05)
same philosophy that every Pokemon has (33:03 - 33:07)
to be yours they can't completely get (33:05 - 33:09)
rid of the mechanic and I would argue (33:07 - 33:11)
that they're even in a bind (33:09 - 33:14)
competitively for that reason because (33:11 - 33:17)
even though it is not like this they (33:14 - 33:19)
want the competitive scene to look like (33:17 - 33:23)
these are trainers who have built a (33:19 - 33:25)
relationship with their team and they're (33:23 - 33:28)
bringing in their squad of Pokemon that (33:25 - 33:29)
they have a relationship with because (33:28 - 33:32)
that's what the presentation is is all (33:29 - 33:34)
about yeah anyone who plays in VGC knows (33:32 - 33:37)
that's really not the mean there is some (33:34 - 33:39)
extent where you build the team so you (33:37 - 33:42)
feel for it but you're it you engineered (33:39 - 33:46)
those pokemon to be precisely how they (33:42 - 33:48)
are it's not like they were born with (33:46 - 33:51)
quirks and you worked around them you're (33:48 - 33:52)
never gonna do that you're always going (33:51 - 33:56)
to bring whatever the best EV spread or (33:52 - 33:59)
the most like counter meta spread for a (33:56 - 34:02)
lowland marowak that there is and bring (33:59 - 34:05)
that with you and and it's and so it's (34:02 - 34:08)
this weird circumstance of they need it (34:05 - 34:11)
to keep their philosophy that every (34:08 - 34:14)
Pokemon is unique to you alive but at (34:11 - 34:18)
the same time it also necessitates the (34:14 - 34:22)
idea that there is only one perfect (34:18 - 34:23)
version of a Pokemon and that dichotomy (34:22 - 34:24)
is (34:23 - 34:27)
strange to answer the question more (34:24 - 34:29)
directly I would say that I like that (34:27 - 34:32)
the game is making it easier and easier (34:29 - 34:37)
to be able to reach that optimal the (34:32 - 34:39)
version of the Pokemon just for the sake (34:37 - 34:41)
of making it easier to enter competitive (34:39 - 34:45)
play there is though the disillusionment (34:41 - 34:48)
of having it more and more visible how (34:45 - 34:52)
factual it is that there is an optimal (34:48 - 34:55)
permutation of any given Pokemon and (34:52 - 34:57)
that's kind of kind of breaks the (34:55 - 35:00)
fantasy of it does that make sense yeah (34:57 - 35:03)
if I was if I was to make a suggestion (35:00 - 35:07)
or I was to want to see some sort of (35:03 - 35:11)
change in this ecosystem I I would look (35:07 - 35:14)
at two other games that are competitive (35:11 - 35:16)
that I play a lot and I'll just use them (35:14 - 35:18)
as reference and hopefully I won't dwell (35:16 - 35:21)
on it too much but let's take destiny (35:18 - 35:24)
for example let's take clash Royale for (35:21 - 35:26)
example going off what was originally (35:24 - 35:29)
said by Travis in myself you fall into (35:26 - 35:31)
this pattern with Pokemon where one (35:29 - 35:35)
nature maybe another nature is the only (35:31 - 35:37)
nature you want for specific Pokemon and (35:35 - 35:41)
I think that that could be solved in at (35:37 - 35:43)
least one way I'm and I'm not saying (35:41 - 35:44)
it's perfect it's just a suggestion it's (35:43 - 35:47)
just a talking point I think there are (35:44 - 35:50)
what like 20-some nature's already I (35:47 - 35:53)
have a list up here anyways there's (35:50 - 35:56)
there's a ton of nature's what could be (35:53 - 35:58)
done in in the future and this obviously (35:56 - 36:01)
this won't happen but what could be done (35:58 - 36:03)
is you bring down the amount of you (36:01 - 36:05)
still keep all of the nature's but you (36:03 - 36:07)
don't apply all the nature's to a (36:05 - 36:10)
Pokemon so for example instead of (36:07 - 36:13)
Oshawott having 20 nature's Oshawott (36:10 - 36:15)
maybe has only four possible nature's (36:13 - 36:17)
maybe you can only get bold asha watts (36:15 - 36:20)
or timid asha watts or calm asha watts (36:17 - 36:23)
and then maybe quirky asha wats so you (36:20 - 36:24)
know now in this family that these are (36:23 - 36:26)
the four nature's they have and they (36:24 - 36:29)
benefit oshawott in a better way than (36:26 - 36:32)
how 20 nature's would benefit Oshawott (36:29 - 36:35)
and you see something like that destiny (36:32 - 36:36)
where (36:35 - 36:39)
okay this is a gun these are all the (36:36 - 36:42)
possible boring you mentioned destiny (36:39 - 36:45)
these are these are all the possible (36:42 - 36:49)
abilities the rolls the gun can have so (36:45 - 36:50)
for example this gun can have this (36:49 - 36:53)
ability but you won't see that ability (36:50 - 36:55)
on any other gun that being said those (36:53 - 36:57)
abilities are random when you pick up (36:55 - 36:59)
the gun I'll just use an example i have (36:57 - 37:01)
this hand cannon called the palindrome (36:59 - 37:04)
anyone can buy that palindrome that hand (37:01 - 37:06)
cannon has the same role because you buy (37:04 - 37:08)
it from a store vendor but it is (37:06 - 37:10)
possible to get dropped a palindrome (37:08 - 37:13)
with different roles and those roles can (37:10 - 37:14)
be better or worse depending on your (37:13 - 37:17)
play style that being said i have gotten (37:14 - 37:20)
four or five palindromes since then that (37:17 - 37:22)
don't seem better than the palindrome i (37:20 - 37:25)
bought from the vendor irene though got (37:22 - 37:27)
a palindrome with the role i wanted and (37:25 - 37:29)
it's an extremely good gun now you could (37:27 - 37:32)
say well Steve that means that Irene has (37:29 - 37:36)
the advantage on the play field because (37:32 - 37:40)
I have to rely on luck or chance to get (37:36 - 37:44)
that gun and technically in Pokemon you (37:40 - 37:46)
have to rely on luck and chance when you (37:44 - 37:48)
encounter a pokemon of course but you (37:46 - 37:50)
have options around that with breeding (37:48 - 37:52)
but with that being said just because (37:50 - 37:54)
somebody has a better role on a gun (37:52 - 37:57)
doesn't mean that automatically makes (37:54 - 37:59)
them a better player and you see that in (37:57 - 38:01)
Pokemon just because somebody has a team (37:59 - 38:04)
that is to the T meta perfect ivs (38:01 - 38:07)
perfect nature's perfect moves doesn't (38:04 - 38:08)
mean that are automatically going to win (38:07 - 38:10)
it doesn't mean they're better there's (38:08 - 38:12)
still that skill of applying yourself (38:10 - 38:15)
when playing competitive game on the (38:12 - 38:17)
same thing with clash royale somebody (38:15 - 38:19)
can spend more money than me in clash (38:17 - 38:23)
royale and have better cards they can (38:19 - 38:25)
laid out in a level 12 barbarians when (38:23 - 38:27)
my barbarians are only level 10 and by (38:25 - 38:29)
default the level 12 is going to beat (38:27 - 38:31)
the level 10 but that doesn't mean I (38:29 - 38:32)
don't have other cards to try to counter (38:31 - 38:36)
and still have the possibility and the (38:32 - 38:38)
chance to win even though I am at a (38:36 - 38:40)
disadvantage because they spent money (38:38 - 38:43)
and I didn't and I think that that that (38:40 - 38:44)
concept I'm trying to explain is (38:43 - 38:47)
something Pokemon is missing and I think (38:44 - 38:50)
it comes down to they make it very hard (38:47 - 38:54)
or they put a lot of walls up to get a (38:50 - 38:57)
Pokemon with a perfect nature or to get (38:54 - 38:59)
a Pokemon with perfect ivs or perfect (38:57 - 39:02)
v's at the end of the day you can still (38:59 - 39:05)
get there no matter what and in other (39:02 - 39:07)
games you other games are still that (39:05 - 39:10)
luck factor of like okay if I play (39:07 - 39:12)
enough maybe I'll get there and I'm not (39:10 - 39:15)
saying either one is good or bad but I'm (39:12 - 39:17)
saying at least in destiny even though (39:15 - 39:19)
I've played it for you know 1500 hours (39:17 - 39:21)
or whatever I still get excited when i (39:19 - 39:24)
get a palindrome like drop for me and I (39:21 - 39:26)
get super excited I look at it and it (39:24 - 39:28)
might be better it might be worse but (39:26 - 39:30)
it's still that excitement in pokemon i (39:28 - 39:33)
never get that and I should not have (39:30 - 39:35)
that feeling when I encounter a ha lucha (39:33 - 39:37)
in the wild for the first time I should (39:35 - 39:39)
be excited but in the back of my head (39:37 - 39:41)
all I think about is well i'm gonna add (39:39 - 39:44)
it to my pokedex but i know i know i can (39:41 - 39:45)
tell you right now that hawlucha is (39:44 - 39:46)
worthless it probably has the wrong (39:45 - 39:49)
nature it probably has one if I'm lucky (39:46 - 39:52)
one perfect IV I'm gonna have to you (39:49 - 39:55)
know find an area to EV train it and (39:52 - 39:57)
this isn't the correct area so it has to (39:55 - 39:58)
sit my box until I get there because I (39:57 - 40:00)
want to level it up because I don't want (39:58 - 40:01)
to mess up the v's there's so many (40:00 - 40:03)
things that go through your head when (40:01 - 40:05)
you encounter pokemon and none of them (40:03 - 40:08)
is oh man that's a Pokemon I want my (40:05 - 40:10)
party and that's a Pokemon that I want (40:08 - 40:12)
to take a journey with it's always it's (40:10 - 40:14)
always okay that's pokemon for my (40:12 - 40:16)
pokédex well I guess I'll braid 200 of (40:14 - 40:18)
them until I get the one I want that's (40:16 - 40:20)
just my thoughts on it I think that's (40:18 - 40:21)
the way you think I can counter at (40:20 - 40:23)
pokemon I'm like oh my gosh that little (40:21 - 40:26)
be guys so cute and then I keep it all (40:23 - 40:27)
the way through the Elite Four and his (40:26 - 40:29)
name is Reuben B I mean I keep I keep (40:27 - 40:31)
all my PO month delayed for because i (40:29 - 40:34)
like it i like the pokemon i catch and (40:31 - 40:36)
used throughout the game and I do form (40:34 - 40:38)
the you know quote unquote bond that (40:36 - 40:40)
Pokemon wants me to form with my team (40:38 - 40:44)
what come what person at a competitive (40:40 - 40:47)
level in the final 32 or the final 64 (40:44 - 40:50)
how many of those people have pokemon (40:47 - 40:54)
that they formed a bond with in in a (40:50 - 40:57)
story sense or an encounter sense and (40:54 - 40:59)
not everyone plays the story in the time (40:57 - 41:01)
how many of those people actually finish (40:59 - 41:03)
the entire story how many of those (41:01 - 41:05)
people have actually bred their own (41:03 - 41:07)
pokemon for themselves versus having (41:05 - 41:08)
somebody else do it and I'm not telling (41:07 - 41:09)
people how to play like if somebody (41:08 - 41:10)
doesn't like the story that's if (41:09 - 41:13)
competitive Pokemon is what brings them (41:10 - 41:16)
to if competitive Pokemon is what brings (41:13 - 41:17)
them to Pokemon and that's what they (41:16 - 41:20)
enjoy the most that's fine Pokemon has (41:17 - 41:23)
always kind of been about discovery and (41:20 - 41:26)
you know that that that chance of (41:23 - 41:29)
getting that chance or surprise of an (41:26 - 41:32)
encounter or a battle or there's like (41:29 - 41:35)
that discovery factor and when when you (41:32 - 41:37)
go down that route of okay I'm just (41:35 - 41:39)
gonna break 200 of them until I get what (41:37 - 41:41)
I want that really takes away from it I (41:39 - 41:45)
don't know maybe I'm looking more for (41:41 - 41:47)
games that like have that surprise (41:45 - 41:50)
factor like you know Fire Emblem heroes (41:47 - 41:53)
or clash royale where you know I open a (41:50 - 41:57)
chest or I I do the stupid orb thing in (41:53 - 41:59)
fire emblem and I you know I get a hero (41:57 - 42:02)
that seems really cool or you know (41:59 - 42:04)
something i wanted and in pokemon when I (42:02 - 42:08)
you know encounter or in Pokemon when (42:04 - 42:09)
you encounter shiny like that is super (42:08 - 42:12)
exciting but when you counter shining in (42:09 - 42:13)
Pokemon that goes back to my original (42:12 - 42:15)
statement of like a month in my back of (42:13 - 42:17)
my head I know okay the shiny is not (42:15 - 42:18)
going to be able to be used for battle (42:17 - 42:20)
it probably doesn't have perfect ivs it (42:18 - 42:21)
probably has the wrong nature it's just (42:20 - 42:24)
gonna sit in a box because I know that (42:21 - 42:26)
Pokemon I encounter in a while they're (42:24 - 42:29)
just not good pokemon sometimes they are (42:26 - 42:32)
sometimes but when you only have like a (42:29 - 42:34)
one in four thousand chance to get a (42:32 - 42:38)
shiny pokemon I don't know what the (42:34 - 42:40)
chances are for like five out of six IVs (42:38 - 42:43)
or what the nature's are for pokemon (42:40 - 42:46)
like one out of twenty four chances to (42:43 - 42:48)
get the nature you want it on the on the (42:46 - 42:50)
slowpoke that you encountered if you're (42:48 - 42:53)
not doing anything to make those chances (42:50 - 42:56)
easier very unlikely yeah if you're not (42:53 - 42:59)
using a synchronizer but hey who just (42:56 - 43:01)
bread fifty Abra's so they have a (42:59 - 43:04)
synchronized her in every nature mr. (43:01 - 43:07)
Will Anderson but but for me I'm not in (43:04 - 43:09)
I'm not into the competitive scene so (43:07 - 43:11)
when when (43:09 - 43:16)
it comes to EV training or IVs or the (43:11 - 43:18)
bottle cap thing I just don't care (43:16 - 43:19)
because I'm never going down that route (43:18 - 43:21)
there's no incentive for me to get a (43:19 - 43:24)
Pokemon to level 100 because anytime you (43:21 - 43:26)
battle somebody there at 50 anyways (43:24 - 43:28)
right and I don't plan on battling (43:26 - 43:30)
anyone it's just not something I really (43:28 - 43:33)
enjoy that much how about you get a (43:30 - 43:34)
Pokemon to level 100 because you love (43:33 - 43:36)
that Pokemon and you want to see it (43:34 - 43:37)
excel in every way that it possibly can (43:36 - 43:40)
okay and do what there's zero content in (43:37 - 43:43)
the game that allows for any use of (43:40 - 43:47)
level 100 Pokemon you travel around and (43:43 - 43:50)
say look at my level 100 chespin have (43:47 - 43:52)
you were to be if you were to say oh (43:50 - 43:56)
there's a couple trainers in this tower (43:52 - 43:59)
that have level 90 and 95 Pokemon and if (43:56 - 44:01)
you can beat them you get this special (43:59 - 44:03)
item okay cool you gave me an incentive (44:01 - 44:05)
you give me a goal to work towards (44:03 - 44:06)
everything does not have to be (44:05 - 44:09)
teleological sometimes you just do (44:06 - 44:12)
things just because that's fair sorry (44:09 - 44:14)
somebody wake up Travis hey sometimes (44:12 - 44:15)
you gotta think outside the box with (44:14 - 44:17)
these I want Pokemon too many were (44:15 - 44:20)
thinking squarely in the box I won't (44:17 - 44:22)
poke my to be the best possible game it (44:20 - 44:24)
can and I don't think right now the (44:22 - 44:26)
systems in place are the best possible (44:24 - 44:29)
systems Alex rights in from Grand Rapids (44:26 - 44:34)
Michigan whoa that's right we're being (44:29 - 44:37)
months ago and I'm very close to you hey (44:34 - 44:40)

semester at gvsu and I planted so real (44:42 - 44:48)
University I plan on moving to Grand (44:45 - 44:51)
Rapids very soon also I'm a new listener (44:48 - 44:53)
I found you during your Sun and Moon (44:51 - 44:55)
episodes sorry if these questions have (44:53 - 44:57)
been asked before wait wait can I just (44:55 - 44:59)
can we interrupt this this emailer for (44:57 - 45:01)
what for how many years have I been (44:59 - 45:04)
doing this and not once has somebody (45:01 - 45:07)
from Georgetown University for it but (45:04 - 45:11)
somebody from Sweet Valley High st. na (45:07 - 45:13)
Wey's that's not what it's called and (45:11 - 45:15)
that's not the first time someone has (45:13 - 45:20)
said to me oh I went to or go to grand (45:15 - 45:22)
valley in fact I think I can't remember (45:20 - 45:24)
if it was Jeff who was on season one of (45:22 - 45:25)
Miz (45:24 - 45:27)
ethical our side show I can't remember (45:25 - 45:29)
if he said that he knew someone from (45:27 - 45:31)
grand valley or just someone from Grand (45:29 - 45:33)
Rapids but I think he also knew someone (45:31 - 45:35)
from grand valley there was someone when (45:33 - 45:39)
I was in college who listened to the (45:35 - 45:41)
show and we both went to Grand Valley (45:39 - 45:43)
and then I forgot to ever meet up with (45:41 - 45:45)
that person whoops and now this person (45:43 - 45:46)
so there's a lot of there's a lot of (45:45 - 45:51)
gvsu representation it was a dig at (45:46 - 45:53)
Georgetown University not Grand Valley (45:51 - 45:56)
State University the sweet value you (45:53 - 45:58)
still refuse to call it anything but (45:56 - 46:00)
sweet valley high so it's not the (45:58 - 46:03)
babysitter babysitter Club books well no (46:00 - 46:06)
it's too sweet valley high books but go (46:03 - 46:10)
on a question was what would each of you (46:06 - 46:13)
be as a pokemon type you can determine (46:10 - 46:17)
this via appearance skill etc just not (46:13 - 46:19)
based on your favorite also if the (46:17 - 46:21)
Nintendo switch were to drop a Pokemon (46:19 - 46:23)
game in the future what changes would (46:21 - 46:25)
you be interested in seeing what are (46:23 - 46:27)
your predictions thanks keep up the (46:25 - 46:30)
great content Alex also in parenthesis (46:27 - 46:33)
said that they would be a fire-type from (46:30 - 46:35)
Grand Rapids I think we might have (46:33 - 46:38)
answered this question before but if you (46:35 - 46:41)
were to be a type of pokemon i guess i (46:38 - 46:44)
would be a water type why is it a (46:41 - 46:46)
question because i feel like that's what (46:44 - 46:48)
i've answered in the past and i can't (46:46 - 46:50)
think of anything else I'd want that you (46:48 - 46:52)
have to be consistent with your past (46:50 - 46:55)
selves BB you're today self my today (46:52 - 46:57)
self would say water you sound so (46:55 - 47:00)
disappointed in yourself no I just my (46:57 - 47:03)
today self would be or to do self would (47:00 - 47:10)
be water ah be ice dragon all right dual (47:03 - 47:12)
typing it up when I've answered this in (47:10 - 47:16)
the past I've said ice because i am a (47:12 - 47:19)
cold-hearted individual but because the (47:16 - 47:21)
question master asked her specifically (47:19 - 47:23)
mentioned don't just pick your favorite (47:21 - 47:26)
I shouldn't just pick ice type because (47:23 - 47:28)
ice is my favorite type so instead for (47:26 - 47:30)
fun I'll say something else and this (47:28 - 47:36)
time i will say that i am poison type (47:30 - 47:38)
because I ruin everything I touch so (47:36 - 47:39)
destructive (47:38 - 47:42)
it's not on purpose it's just everything (47:39 - 47:44)
I touch dies I've Nintendo social to (47:42 - 47:45)
drop pokemon game in the future what (47:44 - 47:47)
changes would be interested in seeing (47:45 - 47:50)
alright so let's talk about Evie's IVs (47:47 - 47:55)
and now yeah I got opinions on that what (47:50 - 47:58)
would you be interested in singing in (47:55 - 48:01)
the future I don't know I feel like some (47:58 - 48:05)
days I could think of a request that I (48:01 - 48:07)
would want and now like today I am kind (48:05 - 48:11)
of stuck on the whole EV IV the the one (48:07 - 48:13)
change that the one thing that I would (48:11 - 48:14)
want and this has kind of been a (48:13 - 48:16)
constant that I've said before if you (48:14 - 48:19)
were to ask me this question four years (48:16 - 48:21)
ago or even three years ago I would have (48:19 - 48:24)
said i want it i want a place to store (48:21 - 48:28)
my pokemon so if my cartridge dies said (48:24 - 48:30)
pokemon are safe and that thing happened (48:28 - 48:33)
which is pokemon bank what i would want (48:30 - 48:36)
for my corp a new pokemon game that (48:33 - 48:37)
wouldn't happen with the switch but what (48:36 - 48:39)
I would want is I would want an (48:37 - 48:42)
online-based pokemon game where people (48:39 - 48:45)
can't cheat and hack pokemon and that's (48:42 - 48:47)
what i would want and that won't happen (48:45 - 48:50)
probably ever but just like in like (48:47 - 48:52)
world warcraft or diablo or overwatch I (48:50 - 48:54)
just named three Blizzard games or (48:52 - 48:58)
destiny or any mobile game like Pokemon (48:54 - 49:00)
shuffle or candy crush or clash Royale (48:58 - 49:04)
you cannot cheat and I like that a lot (49:00 - 49:06)
that would by request I would like a (49:04 - 49:11)
Pokemon game with very intuitive UI and (49:06 - 49:16)
a seamless way to trade and battle with (49:11 - 49:18)
friends on the internet buzz words (49:16 - 49:23)
Travis see mother no I'm seamless his (49:18 - 49:25)
only see much would you describe what (49:23 - 49:27)
how much would you describe what what I (49:25 - 49:31)
want without using those words you know (49:27 - 49:32)
what I mean when I said what I would (49:31 - 49:36)
want a forward-thinking digitally (49:32 - 49:41)
enhanced way to commuters invented (49:36 - 49:46)
reality use it oh just (49:41 - 49:48)
going buzzwords off each other ah (49:46 - 49:51)
alright know that were you not satisfied (49:48 - 49:53)
with the UI choices in sun and moon (49:51 - 49:56)
Pokemon has had better UI then sun and (49:53 - 49:59)
moon heartgold and soulsilver is the one (49:56 - 50:00)
that constantly comes up but i would (49:59 - 50:02)
even argue that diamond and pearl has (50:00 - 50:06)
more useful you I there are some (50:02 - 50:08)
confusing choices we've mentioned how (50:06 - 50:11)
literally everyone on the planet didn't (50:08 - 50:13)
didn't that's not true a lot of people (50:11 - 50:15)
didn't know that you could pick up all (50:13 - 50:17)
of the beans by clicking and dragging (50:15 - 50:19)
until they heard that you can do it on (50:17 - 50:21)
this podcast when we told them that that (50:19 - 50:25)
was a possibility the methodology for (50:21 - 50:28)
registering one of the right Pokemon to (50:25 - 50:31)
a d-pad isn't immediately communicated (50:28 - 50:34)
and I didn't understand that until I had (50:31 - 50:35)
already beaten the game and someone told (50:34 - 50:38)
me how to do that um I mean sun and moon (50:35 - 50:39)
doesn't have the worst you i have any (50:38 - 50:42)
pokemon game but it's not the best and (50:39 - 50:46)
you would think that it would at least (50:42 - 50:50)
be as good as an average modern video (50:46 - 50:53)
game and I don't think that Pokemon (50:50 - 50:56)
always even hits that mark and we've (50:53 - 50:58)
already talked about how much more (50:56 - 51:01)
frustrating that festival plaza is to (50:58 - 51:04)
use in comparison to jen's sixes (51:01 - 51:08)
methodology for interacting with friends (51:04 - 51:10)
on the internet well so I would just (51:08 - 51:14)
like to see possibly a move especially (51:10 - 51:18)
with the switch to some sort of like a (51:14 - 51:20)
visual interactive and a move away from (51:18 - 51:22)
menu based interactive him it may be (51:20 - 51:26)
more like a HUD as opposed to a menu (51:22 - 51:30)
system for for doing things kind of more (51:26 - 51:32)
like destiny and Monster Hunters HUD (51:30 - 51:35)
then then what we get with Pokemon where (51:32 - 51:37)
the upper screen is kind of free and (51:35 - 51:40)
clear of all information and and like (51:37 - 51:42)
you know massively online interactive (51:40 - 51:45)
great question we should take another (51:42 - 51:48)
break and when we come back we got a (51:45 - 51:50)
couple more emails at a Pokemon of the (51:48 - 51:52)
week so we'll take a quick break and we (51:50 - 51:55)
will be right back (51:52 - 51:58)
[Music] (51:55 - 51:58)
[Music] (52:02 - 52:05)
and we are back next email here is from (52:09 - 52:19)
coal from New Jersey hey spj and crew I (52:15 - 52:21)
just wanted to say i love the podcast (52:19 - 52:24)
and what you are doing however when will (52:21 - 52:26)
mention that torterra will mention (52:24 - 52:29)
torterra as being a worse starter than (52:26 - 52:31)
Chikorita i instantly had a write-in to (52:29 - 52:34)
tell him how great torterra is if you (52:31 - 52:36)
need a rot if you need a ride somewhere (52:34 - 52:38)
torterra can take you there can send a (52:36 - 52:40)
quill do that not that I don't like (52:38 - 52:43)
cyndaquil however typhlosion is garbage (52:40 - 52:45)
all I'm asking is for you to reconsider (52:43 - 52:49)
your position on Terra Terra will also (52:45 - 52:53)
Travis is the best alright a number one (52:49 - 52:57)
there is a concept oh that's not a (52:53 - 53:00)
terrible I and well I guess I'm not (52:57 - 53:02)
warmed up anymore after playing at the (53:00 - 53:04)
beginning of the show wow that's awesome (53:02 - 53:06)
enjoy that you're playing taps for (53:04 - 53:09)
yourself as your celebration that's not (53:06 - 53:11)
taps amenable it's not even close to (53:09 - 53:13)
this it's the same interval but it's not (53:11 - 53:16)
even close to the same rhythm and taps (53:13 - 53:17)
is not triumphant like that little (53:16 - 53:24)
fanfare is Berber oh well in the (53:17 - 53:26)
universe that we as physical beings (53:24 - 53:28)
inhabit there is no such thing as a (53:26 - 53:31)
perpetual energy device wherein you can (53:28 - 53:34)
basically have unlimited energy to power (53:31 - 53:37)
your machinery without you know some (53:34 - 53:40)
expenditure of fuel but a cyndaquil you (53:37 - 53:44)
give a berry and you get a furnace you (53:40 - 53:46)
could power a freaking car off of the (53:44 - 53:49)
back of a cyndaquil and drive all over (53:46 - 53:53)
lavender town torterra is too big it is (53:49 - 53:58)
a symmetrical because one sides got a (53:53 - 54:00)
tree the other side's got a rock or (53:58 - 54:03)
something dumb like that asymmetrical (54:00 - 54:07)
equals bad and wrong and you're gonna (54:03 - 54:09)
have a real uncomfortable ride because (54:07 - 54:10)
you're either going to be hanging on to (54:09 - 54:13)
that tree as it lumbers along or sitting (54:10 - 54:14)
on a rock and you know how long can you (54:13 - 54:17)
sit on the rock not for very long I'll (54:14 - 54:19)
tell you that cyndaquil powers your car (54:17 - 54:22)
you sitting in luxury you're (54:19 - 54:25)
a Cadillac lap of luxury is wonderful (54:22 - 54:28)
torterra is no Cadillac dude there you (54:25 - 54:32)
go Adam from Ohio writes in probably my (54:28 - 54:36)
guess would be the only Adam in Ohio hey (54:32 - 54:38)
Pokemon podcast crew I am a longtime fan (54:36 - 54:40)
of the show I just wanted to say thanks (54:38 - 54:42)
for all the hours of entertainment that (54:40 - 54:45)
you have given me along the years I (54:42 - 54:47)
started around episode 35 or whenever (54:45 - 54:49)
Travis just started getting involved (54:47 - 54:51)
with the show just wanted to ask (54:49 - 54:53)
everyone's favorite memory of being (54:51 - 54:56)
involved with the show by the way Travis (54:53 - 55:00)
is the best whoa two in a row um you (54:56 - 55:04)
know he picks these PS if I don't that's (55:00 - 55:07)
the thing that the thing is here I do (55:04 - 55:09)
pick the emails but no one ever writes (55:07 - 55:12)
in and says I'm the best we've already (55:09 - 55:14)
gonna do your last we have one person (55:12 - 55:17)
you guys both get Travis and Will are (55:14 - 55:20)
the best like four times in episode no (55:17 - 55:22)
one's favorite character on a TV show is (55:20 - 55:24)
the main character so I see I'll just (55:22 - 55:29)
pick one of us okay all right sure yes I (55:24 - 55:31)
was looking for cities to move in the (55:29 - 55:33)
Midwest after graduating college I was (55:31 - 55:35)
looking at Milwaukee just wondering what (55:33 - 55:39)
your thoughts on the city's pros and (55:35 - 55:42)
cons are so I guess I quite or for me (55:39 - 55:44)
but going no no no no no that's for me (55:42 - 55:48)
pros of Milwaukee has a very nice arts (55:44 - 55:52)
community open very welcoming it has a (55:48 - 55:54)
lot of cute little places you can go to (55:52 - 55:57)
if you're into Harley's obviously that's (55:54 - 55:59)
a big segment of the population there (55:57 - 56:02)
and the weather is mild and comfortable (55:59 - 56:05)
all right what were you saying milwaukee (56:02 - 56:07)
is the worst but I'll get to that (56:05 - 56:10)
favorite memory of the podcast Travis (56:07 - 56:13)
you got one mmm I'll have to think a (56:10 - 56:14)
little longer either of you do you (56:13 - 56:16)
already have your answers all right you (56:14 - 56:17)
guys can think I'll complain about (56:16 - 56:19)
Milwaukee for a second oh wait no I (56:17 - 56:21)
heard I know my answer but I'm not (56:19 - 56:23)
allowed to talk about it because there's (56:21 - 56:26)
a moratorium on talking about the thing (56:23 - 56:29)
that we did oh right yep there's a (56:26 - 56:32)
really cool thing we did this fall (56:29 - 56:34)
aesthetic aunt say but other than that I (56:32 - 56:36)
would (56:34 - 56:39)
a that going to VGC with all the pals (56:36 - 56:43)
was really fun uh but would be my (56:39 - 56:46)
favorite podcast moment so I just think (56:43 - 56:51)
of like of recording in every single (56:46 - 56:53)
time we record it's incredibly (56:51 - 56:55)
uncomfortable my none of my furniture is (56:53 - 56:57)
comfortable and I have to sit in it for (56:55 - 56:59)
hours at a time or I'm sitting on the (56:57 - 57:02)
floor to record which is also very (56:59 - 57:05)
uncomfortable I think maybe when it was (57:02 - 57:08)
episode 100 and i went to let my friends (57:05 - 57:10)
dog out and I went through out the back (57:08 - 57:12)
of his house and the door locked behind (57:10 - 57:16)
me and the way that backyards are in DC (57:12 - 57:19)
you can't I mean if you're in the (57:16 - 57:22)
backyard your stock you didn't and I had (57:19 - 57:24)
to get somebody to get the keys and (57:22 - 57:28)
throw them over of church wall and then (57:24 - 57:30)
just to make it home in time to record (57:28 - 57:32)
episode 100 there you go I don't know if (57:30 - 57:34)
that's a delightful memory but that's (57:32 - 57:36)
memory nonetheless I would say one of my (57:34 - 57:39)
favorite parts of the show would just be (57:36 - 57:41)
recording with some of our guests like (57:39 - 57:45)
gaijin hunter or Austin Creed from WWE (57:41 - 57:48)
or Dan Rikard from giant Bob I think (57:45 - 57:52)
those were just really cool things that (57:48 - 57:54)
I did so back to Adams question about (57:52 - 57:56)
the Midwest and Milwaukee I think (57:54 - 57:58)
Milwaukee is a terrible city personally (57:56 - 58:01)
I've lived here for like twenty six (57:58 - 58:03)
twenty (58:01 - 58:03)
five years of the 28 years I've been (58:03 - 58:11)
alive or something like that Milwaukee (58:07 - 58:14)
has the Brewers and they have the bucks (58:11 - 58:16)
and they have whatever sports that (58:14 - 58:19)
people enjoy and that's really big and (58:16 - 58:22)
so if you're into sports that's that's a (58:19 - 58:26)
draw that Milwaukee brings the other big (58:22 - 58:27)
thing that I would say that will they (58:26 - 58:29)
mention which is probably the biggest (58:27 - 58:34)
draw would be the beer scene of having (58:29 - 58:37)
all these beer brewing companies around (58:34 - 58:39)
Milwaukee and even in the suburbs of (58:37 - 58:41)
Milwaukee like that's a big thing I (58:39 - 58:45)
think kutta hey which is a a smaller (58:41 - 58:47)
city on the south side of Milwaukee has (58:45 - 58:51)
like more bars / any other kind of (58:47 - 58:54)
building in their city there's just bars (58:51 - 58:56)
everywhere in Milwaukee and people i (58:54 - 58:58)
guess like that i don't i don't drink (58:56 - 59:00)
I've said that before I don't care for (58:58 - 59:03)
it I don't go to bars but they exist (59:00 - 59:06)
everywhere and that is what people want (59:03 - 59:07)
to do in Milwaukee and that's cool (59:06 - 59:11)
that's not for me so those are kind of (59:07 - 59:13)
the two big things there is somewhat of (59:11 - 59:15)
an art scene but that's mostly downtown (59:13 - 59:19)
Milwaukee there's not a ton of terrible (59:15 - 59:21)
like there's not a ton of like little (59:19 - 59:24)
shops and unique places that you would (59:21 - 59:27)
think kind of once you've been there (59:24 - 59:29)
once or twice that that's really all (59:27 - 59:32)
there is to it and the these problems or (59:29 - 59:34)
maybe they're not problems maybe you (59:32 - 59:35)
love sports and beer and Milwaukee's the (59:34 - 59:37)
place for you but these these things (59:35 - 59:39)
probably exist in other cities I've been (59:37 - 59:40)
to a lot of other cities I can't say (59:39 - 59:42)
that there's one that stands out as (59:40 - 59:44)
being like my favorite city to be I just (59:42 - 59:47)
don't particularly particularly like (59:44 - 59:49)
Milwaukee I don't like some of the rules (59:47 - 59:51)
and regulations they have at a city (59:49 - 59:53)
level or even a state level but that's (59:51 - 59:55)
that's just me I don't really want to (59:53 - 59:57)
pay an extra thirty dollar pothole tax (59:55 - 59:59)
on my registration license on top of my (59:57 - 60:01)
already a hundred and twenty dollar (59:59 - 60:03)
registration fee just because Milwaukee (60:01 - 60:05)
wants to charge you 30 bucks to fill (60:03 - 60:06)
your potholes and they still don't (60:05 - 60:08)
anyways but that's just me being better (60:06 - 60:12)
and renewing my license last week but my (60:08 - 60:14)
registration why do you choose to live (60:12 - 60:16)
there I choose to live here because (60:14 - 60:17)
Irene has a (60:16 - 60:20)
job that she works at and she likes a (60:17 - 60:23)
lot technically I can work anywhere (60:20 - 60:25)
because I'm salary and I can work (60:23 - 60:26)
remotely so it doesn't matter where I (60:25 - 60:30)
live I can still do my job if I got a (60:26 - 60:32)
different job whether wherever that (60:30 - 60:35)
would be I would move in a heartbeat Wow (60:32 - 60:37)
but if there were no buffalo wild wings (60:35 - 60:40)
where you moved to you know that's a (60:37 - 60:43)
tough call also a big like complaint is (60:40 - 60:45)
that a lot of my really good friends (60:43 - 60:46)
have moved out of Milwaukee to other (60:45 - 60:49)
places and the Baja now you know how I (60:46 - 60:53)
feel I used to be a flabébé and then all (60:49 - 60:55)
my friends left Washington DC and I (60:53 - 60:58)
turned into a cure of Tommy from (60:55 - 61:01)
Columbus Ohio wrightson says the main (60:58 - 61:03)
reason for this emails I wanted to ask (61:01 - 61:05)
if you ever considered doing an (61:03 - 61:09)
interview of youtuber verla safai they (61:05 - 61:11)
make great content on and how-to videos (61:09 - 61:13)
and they have a strong anti-cheating (61:11 - 61:15)
stance when it comes the VGC realm I (61:13 - 61:17)
don't know if you've reached out to them (61:15 - 61:20)
in the past or if you if they wanted to (61:17 - 61:23)
be on your show will admit that they are (61:20 - 61:27)
rather diverse figure in the pokey tuber (61:23 - 61:29)
community but I do really like their (61:27 - 61:30)
content and I would hope that you would (61:29 - 61:33)
give them some thought Tommy I just (61:30 - 61:35)
pulled this email because it was more of (61:33 - 61:39)
a general question upon the youtubers (61:35 - 61:40)
and the other poke people in the pokemon (61:39 - 61:42)
community I don't know if you guys know (61:40 - 61:45)
so um I'm pretty sure the word he was (61:42 - 61:47)
looking for was not diverse but divisive (61:45 - 61:50)
because that's what wrote divisive vs if (61:47 - 61:52)
I is known for for being abrasive and (61:50 - 61:56)
caustic for sometimes possibly no reason (61:52 - 62:00)
other than to raise drama as us gay (61:56 - 62:03)
people like to say I don't know their (62:00 - 62:05)
content I've never watched them I don't (62:03 - 62:09)
watch a lot of pokey youtubers ever (62:05 - 62:12)
guess I've gotten on I am a personal fan (62:09 - 62:16)
of in some aspect or another and so that (62:12 - 62:19)
that is important to me in general (62:16 - 62:21)
though I have lease heard from our slack (62:19 - 62:24)
community that they would want to see (62:21 - 62:27)
more guests on the show that are not (62:24 - 62:30)
youtubers that's saying that (62:27 - 62:32)
we wouldn't or we're stopping having (62:30 - 62:34)
youtubers on the show that's not what I (62:32 - 62:36)
was saying at all I'm just saying that (62:34 - 62:38)
currently I am looking at people outside (62:36 - 62:40)
of the YouTube community and I haven't (62:38 - 62:41)
really focused on the YouTube community (62:40 - 62:43)
not that I spent a lot of time there but (62:41 - 62:46)
I am looking outside of that for now but (62:43 - 62:47)
i don't know i don't know if you guys (62:46 - 62:49)
were big fans of somebody else I mean (62:47 - 62:51)
Travis was a big fan of Griffin and I (62:49 - 62:55)
got Griffin on sure sure right only (62:51 - 62:57)
Travis is mcilroy fans yeah right (62:55 - 63:00)
correct I mean I'm a big fan of Stanley (62:57 - 63:02)
Kubrick can we get Stanley Kubrick on (63:00 - 63:05)
that might be a little more difficult I (63:02 - 63:07)
did I liked Steve's response better (63:05 - 63:14)
who's that only one of the greatest film (63:07 - 63:16)
directors of all time direct all right (63:14 - 63:21)
so like shining about X of 2001 Space (63:16 - 63:24)
Odyssey only if your texts go beyond the (63:21 - 63:27)
grave yep to the Overlook Hotel (63:24 - 63:30)
clockwork orange like the list goes on (63:27 - 63:34)
does it Travis yeah ill against wide (63:30 - 63:37)
shut yeah the list does go on eyes wide (63:34 - 63:41)
shut 2001 a Space Odyssey I'd it's my (63:37 - 63:44)
one yeah there's the really the one like (63:41 - 63:46)
so boring that he got bored making a (63:44 - 63:48)
half way through that's like a biography (63:46 - 63:51)
of someone that I've never seen no taxi (63:48 - 63:56)
driver did you do that one I don't oh (63:51 - 63:56)
never did the 11 film not as your Satan (63:56 - 64:03)
was Pokemon a movie 2000 taxi driver is (64:00 - 64:07)
Scorsese Stanley Kubrick did no pokemon (64:03 - 64:09)
movies yeah we should've held me down (64:07 - 64:11)
stand right up his wheelhouse and yeah (64:09 - 64:13)
but in a bit of great one he could have (64:11 - 64:17)
done the the Victini movie be good of (64:13 - 64:20)
that was there is an alternate universe (64:17 - 64:22)
or Stanley Kubrick directed the Victini (64:20 - 64:25)
movie and it's exactly the same Victini (64:22 - 64:29)
movie that we got with two alternate (64:25 - 64:32)
versions of creates my office one with (64:29 - 64:35)
the restaurant like that's the weird (64:32 - 64:37)
thing about about multiple worlds theory (64:35 - 64:41)
is that not only is every world possible (64:37 - 64:44)
but just very specific ones like that (64:41 - 64:46)
there's a world where Travis's will in (64:44 - 64:48)
Willa's Travis I believe it well no I (64:46 - 64:51)
mean deve this is this is clearly the (64:48 - 64:53)
best of all possible worlds as I think (64:51 - 64:55)
that was live knits who posited that (64:53 - 64:57)
we're in the best of all possible worlds (64:55 - 65:01)
worlds Wilhelm Gottfried Leibniz (64:57 - 65:03)
Gottfried Wilhelm lime debts it's this (65:01 - 65:07)
item this is not philosophy can be lie (65:03 - 65:10)
bets you said that next question final (65:07 - 65:14)
question from Riley from victoria (65:10 - 65:17)
australia in parenthesis not perth i (65:14 - 65:22)
knew that was good hey guys i just i (65:17 - 65:24)
recently started listening during the (65:22 - 65:27)
sun and moon episode and i've been (65:24 - 65:29)
loving it every week everyone on the (65:27 - 65:31)
show adds a positive and unique (65:29 - 65:33)
personality to the show and it only (65:31 - 65:36)
draws you in more kudos to everyone and (65:33 - 65:38)
keep up the good work will is my (65:36 - 65:42)
favorite just FYI well thank you my (65:38 - 65:44)
question is today we had just had the (65:42 - 65:46)
pokemon bank release how do you think (65:44 - 65:48)
that how do you think it will impact the (65:46 - 65:52)
current VGC mehta maybe something like (65:48 - 65:55)
stealth rock Skarmory also what will be (65:52 - 65:58)
what was or will be your first pokemon (65:55 - 66:00)
you bring across from Pokemon bank my (65:58 - 66:04)
favorite was bri loom cheers guys Riley (66:00 - 66:07)
so the in the highest level the effect (66:04 - 66:10)
on the Pokemon meta will be the ability (66:07 - 66:13)
to breed egg moves on to a lowland (66:10 - 66:15)
Pokemon that they previously have not (66:13 - 66:17)
had access to so one of the ones that (66:15 - 66:20)
I've seen as an example in our slack (66:17 - 66:22)
discussions just to bring that up again (66:20 - 66:28)
is so little sizzle Ozil getting out (66:22 - 66:31)
access to fake out as an egg move which (66:28 - 66:32)
it did not have access to before and (66:31 - 66:35)
fake out can be a very powerful move in (66:32 - 66:38)
VGC doubles so there will be other egg (66:35 - 66:41)
moves that will be discovered and will (66:38 - 66:45)
become breedable within the BGC 2017 (66:41 - 66:47)
context that will change up the meta (66:45 - 66:50)
somewhat and i don't think that we've (66:47 - 66:52)
had sufficient time to see how that's (66:50 - 66:54)
going to tumble out yet for what are (66:52 - 66:57)
going to be the top tier teams (66:54 - 66:58)
with these new egg moves but I'm sure (66:57 - 67:00)
somebody has done some predictions and (66:58 - 67:02)
thoughts on it I honestly wouldn't (67:00 - 67:05)
anticipate that much of a difference I (67:02 - 67:12)
also don't believe that the suggestion (67:05 - 67:16)
posited by the email writer will pan out (67:12 - 67:18)
the the idea of skarmory getting more (67:16 - 67:20)
usage because of stealth rock simply (67:18 - 67:23)
because that's kind of the reasons Carm (67:20 - 67:24)
rate doesn't really get used generally (67:23 - 67:28)
in VGC is because entry hazards are not (67:24 - 67:31)
that great in bring four doubles you're (67:28 - 67:33)
not really getting a lot of usage out of (67:31 - 67:37)
them there's less switching and there (67:33 - 67:40)
are fewer Pokemon so it's not as strong (67:37 - 67:44)
as it is in singles so I wouldn't see (67:40 - 67:46)
that at solas all is the one that came (67:44 - 67:49)
to mind for me immediately i'm sure (67:46 - 67:51)
people who know the format in and out (67:49 - 67:53)
would say that there's a much more (67:51 - 67:54)
obvious example but that's the one that (67:53 - 67:58)
came to mind i I mean the game is you (67:54 - 68:01)
know has has changed a little bit in (67:58 - 68:04)
that just as things have have played out (68:01 - 68:07)
like your people are using tabu ley ley (68:04 - 68:10)
and more people believe it or not are (68:07 - 68:13)
using arcanine it's big our canines (68:10 - 68:15)
become the number one most used but I (68:13 - 68:16)
don't think it's gonna be that some (68:15 - 68:19)
pokemon that wasn't even in the the (68:16 - 68:22)
running in terms of frequent usage will (68:19 - 68:24)
suddenly jump into it and for that (68:22 - 68:26)
reason I don't even think so lazlé will (68:24 - 68:28)
make that much of a difference but now (68:26 - 68:31)
maybe some sort of at least a presence (68:28 - 68:33)
in the meta as opposed to kind of not (68:31 - 68:35)
really being in it although solazzo can (68:33 - 68:39)
ohko a car tana so i don't know what how (68:35 - 68:41)
maybe that's just as cart ama that's not (68:39 - 68:44)
it is it yet is Cortana Cortana is used (68:41 - 68:47)
yeah Cortana um yet master Chang (68:44 - 68:51)
ultimately the 2017 meta is defined by (68:47 - 68:54)
the top booze and the ultra beasts none (68:51 - 68:56)
of those are breathable so opening a (68:54 - 68:59)
Pokemon bank does nothing to change the (68:56 - 69:03)
influence of those pokemon game in the (68:59 - 69:05)
competitive scene I don't think travis (69:03 - 69:08)
has Pokemon bank that's correct so I can (69:05 - 69:09)
answer the second question of what's (69:08 - 69:10)
broken (69:09 - 69:12)
bringing up through it I brought all my (69:10 - 69:15)
pokemon from bank to sun and moon the (69:12 - 69:20)
first ones I brought over were my backs (69:15 - 69:23)
of legendaries most being the special (69:20 - 69:25)
event legendaries that they did all (69:23 - 69:28)
throughout 2016 and my pokemon bank is (69:25 - 69:30)
completely disorganized so I'm just (69:28 - 69:32)
going to dump those suckers in take them (69:30 - 69:35)
out don't matter yeah my firsties mines (69:32 - 69:37)
pretty disorganized too I have some (69:35 - 69:40)
organization I at least have like I have (69:37 - 69:42)
two boxes with legendaries I have then a (69:40 - 69:44)
box of special event Pokemon like my (69:42 - 69:47)
world scraggy the ash Pikachu that you (69:44 - 69:49)
could get for toys from toys r us and (69:47 - 69:52)
then I have a box of Pokemon that were (69:49 - 69:56)
bred for me for VGC competitions that I (69:52 - 69:58)
used in the two years I've competed and (69:56 - 70:02)
then I started organizing pokemon x type (69:58 - 70:04)
like a ghost box of water box obviously (70:02 - 70:06)
one box doesn't hold them all but i (70:04 - 70:08)
started at least organizing what I what (70:06 - 70:10)
I did have I don't know if that's the (70:08 - 70:12)
best way to do it or just do it index (70:10 - 70:14)
number and I am starting to think about (70:12 - 70:16)
what team I'm going to build for my son (70:14 - 70:19)
play through I definitely am (70:16 - 70:21)
ninety-seven percent certain it's gonna (70:19 - 70:24)
have volcarona on it but then the other (70:21 - 70:25)
five I don't know what I'm going to (70:24 - 70:28)
breed for that so why is that funny I (70:25 - 70:30)
don't know that just your volcarona (70:28 - 70:33)
dedication that's all volcarona (70:30 - 70:35)
talonflame get me all the fire types all (70:33 - 70:37)
the fire now I've got a nice cold heart (70:35 - 70:40)
um thank you everyone that wrote in if (70:37 - 70:43)

that you want and we will attempt to (70:54 - 70:58)
read it and talk about it thank you to (70:56 - 71:01)
everyone who wrote in today i'm going to (70:58 - 71:03)
toss it over to Travis they're gonna do (71:01 - 71:06)
the Pokemon of the week and then we'll (71:03 - 71:12)
wrap up the show I pretty arbitrarily (71:06 - 71:15)
pick mismagius I like that Pokemon it's (71:12 - 71:16)
not one of my favorites but its Pokemon (71:15 - 71:20)
that I like so I picked it we have two (71:16 - 71:23)
sets from our pokemon of the week select (71:20 - 71:24)
channel (71:23 - 71:26)
this week the first is from frequent (71:24 - 71:28)
contributor actually both these are from (71:26 - 71:30)
frequent contributors the first one (71:28 - 71:33)
comes from kevin AKA Koopa Prez we have (71:30 - 71:36)
a timid nature for Miss majus with 250 2 (71:33 - 71:40)
v's and speed 252 and HP and foreign (71:36 - 71:42)
special attack now that Evie spread (71:40 - 71:44)
should already tip you off that we are (71:42 - 71:48)
doing a sort of fast but with some bulk (71:44 - 71:52)
support set because it we're getting (71:48 - 71:54)
moves we we clearly want speed to be (71:52 - 71:56)
able to do the moves that are going to (71:54 - 71:57)
be on this move set but we want to live (71:56 - 72:00)
more than we really want to be able to (71:57 - 72:02)
deal damage items going to be leftovers (72:00 - 72:05)
the move set is thunder wave taunt hex (72:02 - 72:09)
and paint split we can see there now why (72:05 - 72:12)
that Evie spread is the one we're going (72:09 - 72:14)
to use most of these moves are simply (72:12 - 72:18)
nondamaging moves that are going to (72:14 - 72:22)
hinder the opponent in some way with the (72:18 - 72:25)
notable exception of hex which is a (72:22 - 72:28)
ghost-type move that typically has 65 (72:25 - 72:32)
base power and 100% accuracy but if the (72:28 - 72:37)
opponent is affected by a non-volatile (72:32 - 72:39)
status condition so that's anything that (72:37 - 72:41)
stays if the pokemon switches out and (72:39 - 72:44)
back in if the pokemon is afflicted by (72:41 - 72:45)
one of those status conditions its base (72:44 - 72:48)
power will double to 130 which is very (72:45 - 72:50)
strong especially for a move with 100 (72:48 - 72:55)
base 100% accuracy so the idea there is (72:50 - 72:57)
that even though most of what you're (72:55 - 73:00)
doing is applying paralysis with thunder (72:57 - 73:06)
wave taunt with taunt or dealing kind of (73:00 - 73:09)
dealing sort of weird in direct damage (73:06 - 73:11)
with pain split or healing yourself with (73:09 - 73:15)
pain split you have the ability to deal (73:11 - 73:18)
damage if in instances were like maybe (73:15 - 73:21)
mismagius is the last pokemon alive or (73:18 - 73:24)
if you're just in a spot where throwing (73:21 - 73:26)
another thunder wave out there doesn't (73:24 - 73:28)
really do anything for you you have that (73:26 - 73:30)
option to deal some damage because 130 (73:28 - 73:32)
base power is still strong regardless of (73:30 - 73:34)
how much you've invested in special (73:32 - 73:36)
attack koopa pres also mentions that (73:34 - 73:38)
will-o'-wisp and (73:36 - 73:43)
room are also options the second set (73:38 - 73:45)
comes to us from Gabe Brown and this is (73:43 - 73:47)
very different this is Miss majus with (73:45 - 73:51)
Troy specs so a very offensive SAT (73:47 - 73:54)
choice pax is an item that increases (73:51 - 73:58)
your special attack by 1.5 if memory (73:54 - 74:01)
serves let's see by fifty percent so (73:58 - 74:03)
respects boosts your special attack by (74:01 - 74:05)
fifty percent but makes it so that you (74:03 - 74:08)
can only use the first move you've (74:05 - 74:10)
selected because so the first turn you (74:08 - 74:11)
can use any move out of your four but (74:10 - 74:13)
then after that you have to keep using (74:11 - 74:16)
that move until the Pokemon switches out (74:13 - 74:20)
and back in nature is timid the evo 252 (74:16 - 74:23)
and special attack in 252 and speed the (74:20 - 74:25)
remaining for an HP and the move set is (74:23 - 74:28)
shadow ball mystical fire which is which (74:25 - 74:29)
might be a new one to some people it (74:28 - 74:31)
came out gen-6 but I'll get to it later (74:29 - 74:34)
the Shadow Ball mystical fire power gem (74:31 - 74:36)
and icy wind the Shadow Ball is (74:34 - 74:38)
obviously for the same time attack bonus (74:36 - 74:41)
power gem and icy wind well so power gem (74:38 - 74:44)
is good a type coverage icy wind is a (74:41 - 74:46)
very good move in doubles because it (74:44 - 74:48)
hits both opponents and lowers their (74:46 - 74:51)
speed I'm very strong it doesn't have a (74:48 - 74:54)
high base power but the ability to lower (74:51 - 74:56)
the speed of both opponents by one stage (74:54 - 75:00)
can be very useful it's similar to UM in (74:56 - 75:03)
that way to we were talking about snarl (75:00 - 75:06)
earlier and earlier a week where it's (75:03 - 75:10)
not a very strong move but the fact that (75:06 - 75:13)
it's guaranteed to lower um stat by a (75:10 - 75:16)
full stage of both opponents is quite (75:13 - 75:17)
good and that actually brings us to (75:16 - 75:19)
mystical fire which is very similar to (75:17 - 75:24)
snarl it's a fire-type move that is only (75:19 - 75:27)
learned by Oh what is fennekin evolved (75:24 - 75:31)
into how can I remember don't fox yeah (75:28 - 75:34)
delphox oh that's embarrassing so a (75:31 - 75:36)
mystical fire is only available to (75:34 - 75:39)
Delphic animus majus an interesting (75:36 - 75:42)
combination I suppose but Pokemon to (75:39 - 75:44)
learn it's a fire type move with 75 base (75:42 - 75:47)
power that was lower in generation 6 (75:44 - 75:51)
that was 65 and hurt yeah it was 65 and (75:47 - 75:52)
generation (75:51 - 75:55)
sex bumped up to 75 now 100% accuracy (75:52 - 75:57)
it's guaranteed to lower the Special (75:55 - 76:00)
Attack of the target by one stage it's (75:57 - 76:02)
notable that it's not quite like snarl (76:00 - 76:04)
and that it only hits one opponent but (76:02 - 76:06)
it does have significantly high higher (76:04 - 76:08)
base power so it's less about this (76:06 - 76:11)
throwing a wide net and lowering (76:08 - 76:13)
everything regardless if you know if the (76:11 - 76:15)
intended target switches or whatever (76:13 - 76:18)
your you'll hit something mystical fires (76:15 - 76:20)
is used a little differently but it's (76:18 - 76:24)
has similar effect yeah so those are two (76:20 - 76:26)
sets you have one that's more of a (76:24 - 76:29)
support set and one that's much more (76:26 - 76:34)
offensive perfect perfect we have four (76:29 - 76:38)
shiny version so where I come in shiny (76:34 - 76:42)
mismagius gets like a greenish gold (76:38 - 76:44)
going on instead of the purple pink oh (76:42 - 76:48)
that's not a golden green buddy it's (76:44 - 76:54)
like a Russian hopper no that's more (76:48 - 76:59)
like an organic mulch action it says (76:54 - 77:02)
that's not good looking uh miss megan (76:59 - 77:06)
with a puss screen miss vegas has miss (77:02 - 77:09)
pegasus base HP attack and defense are (77:06 - 77:12)
the same as misdreavus but its base (77:09 - 77:14)
special attack defense and speed are (77:12 - 77:17)
higher mismagius comes before haunch (77:14 - 77:20)
crow in the sinnoh pokedex but mismagius (77:17 - 77:23)
is pre evolution misdreavus comes after (77:20 - 77:26)
honge crows pre evolution murkrow in the (77:23 - 77:30)
Johto pokedex mismagius is based on the (77:26 - 77:32)
concept of mages witch's magic (77:30 - 77:35)
hallucinations and banshees good old (77:32 - 77:38)
ghost pokemon was miss Maggie's the (77:35 - 77:42)
first ghost only pokemon cousin Jen one (77:38 - 77:46)
it was just ghost poison well I the (77:42 - 77:48)
thing about Miss well mystery dias (77:46 - 77:52)
matches right but Miss majus is actually (77:48 - 77:54)
introduced in generation 4 that's the (77:52 - 77:56)
weird thing it's a it was a new (77:54 - 77:59)
evolution in gen 4 to the generation to (77:56 - 78:00)
pokemon mischievous so it's more (77:59 - 78:02)
accurate to say that mischievous was the (78:00 - 78:04)
first yeah that's what I meant to say (78:02 - 78:05)
like that (78:04 - 78:09)
line was the first yeah I think so all (78:05 - 78:11)
right let's uh let's clean some houses (78:09 - 78:14)
let's do some housecleaning first bit of (78:11 - 78:19)
housecleaning is that hopefully by the (78:14 - 78:20)
time you are listening to this or (78:19 - 78:24)
shortly after there should be a new it's (78:20 - 78:27)
super effective shirt up one of those (78:24 - 78:29)
services teespring represent whatever (78:27 - 78:33)
one I decide to do there they're great (78:29 - 78:36)
services because I can put the shirts (78:33 - 78:38)
really cheap you guys can get them for (78:36 - 78:40)
like twenty bucks and then I don't have (78:38 - 78:42)
to worry about shipping them that's like (78:40 - 78:45)
my biggest hassle is in the past I've (78:42 - 78:47)
ordered shirts you know you wait for (78:45 - 78:49)
them to come in yeah then sell them and (78:47 - 78:51)
then you ship them and then you get (78:49 - 78:53)
stuck with a bunch of leftovers because (78:51 - 78:56)
you think medium is the most popular and (78:53 - 78:59)
no one buys medium then you get all (78:56 - 79:02)
these mediums left over anyways there (78:59 - 79:03)
should be some new shirts if you're (79:02 - 79:06)
interested I try to price them as cheap (79:03 - 79:08)
as possible I don't look to make profits (79:06 - 79:09)
on the shirts I think the last time I (79:08 - 79:11)
sent out a shirt i made like twelve (79:09 - 79:13)
dollars after everything was said and (79:11 - 79:15)
