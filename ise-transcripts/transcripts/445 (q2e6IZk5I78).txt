yesterday driving around no bag on raids (0:57 - 1:03)
no puzzles no mynums which i see a (1:01 - 1:04)
million of (1:03 - 1:07)
none i think the possible minins were (1:04 - 1:07)
discussed (1:07 - 1:10)
on the blog they didn't wanna because (1:07 - 1:11)
people don't want (1:10 - 1:13)
plus on mind and so they just saved it (1:11 - 1:14)
for the sentence day yeah (1:13 - 1:17)
which is probably a better way of doing (1:14 - 1:18)
it (1:17 - 1:21)
yeah well well i mean today is only one (1:18 - 1:21)
coin (1:21 - 1:23)
so you get it was one coin for three (1:21 - 1:26)
incense so i think it was fine yes (1:23 - 1:27)
uh yeah well hold on before we talk (1:26 - 1:29)
about incense (1:27 - 1:32)
day uh will is also here (1:29 - 1:35)
uh i did not get my bag on unless you (1:32 - 1:37)
mean at the supermarket and then i got a (1:35 - 1:42)
paper bag (1:37 - 1:42)
we're all here we don't have uh we (1:44 - 1:48)
covered a lot of news last week (1:46 - 1:51)
uh we saved the united (1:48 - 1:51)
some stuff to talk st of course look (1:53 - 1:57)
25th anniversary (1:55 - 1:59)
there could be there could be nothing to (1:57 - 2:01)
talk about (1:59 - 2:02)
and we would still feel two hours ago (2:01 - 2:05)
we'd still show up (2:02 - 2:07)
i mean greg and i both bought pokemon (2:05 - 2:09)
themed workout gear that's an hour's (2:07 - 2:11)
worth of conversation right there (2:09 - 2:14)
that shirt is so good (2:11 - 2:16)
should i buy it how do you define good (2:14 - 2:17)
how do you fight no (2:16 - 2:19)
you won't like it how do you define good (2:17 - 2:20)
greg it's (2:19 - 2:23)
so when it's super comfortable it's soft (2:20 - 2:24)
it's lightweight (2:23 - 2:26)
it's very good for working out it fits (2:24 - 2:27)
really well (2:26 - 2:29)
i agree with all of these points it's (2:27 - 2:31)
cute now if i could only (2:29 - 2:34)
have a gym to go to that i wasn't afraid (2:31 - 2:35)
to go to (2:34 - 2:38)
ringfield i bought two i have ring fit (2:35 - 2:39)
adventure i'm level (2:38 - 2:43)
85 or 87. you there's no point in (2:39 - 2:44)
looking cute for ring fit adventure (2:43 - 2:46)
because nobody's going to see you except (2:44 - 2:52)
your husband (2:46 - 2:54)
then people work out with you nobody's (2:52 - 2:57)
going to watch me stream (2:54 - 2:59)
ring fit adventure with my dogs down in (2:57 - 3:01)
my living room (2:59 - 3:05)
i purchased two workout tank tops (3:01 - 3:08)
from pokemoncenter.com when you know it (3:05 - 3:08)
wasn't (3:08 - 3:12)
down right and yes i can agree material (3:08 - 3:14)
super soft very nice for for working out (3:12 - 3:15)
in the graphic (3:14 - 3:18)
on the pikachu that's more of a cotton (3:15 - 3:19)
tank top which is like (3:18 - 3:21)
yeah it's in between you know it's what (3:19 - 3:23)
do they call it athleisure (3:21 - 3:24)
yeah yeah you can wear it to work out (3:23 - 3:26)
but also you know you could just wear it (3:24 - 3:28)
to hang out if you'd like hanging out in (3:26 - 3:29)
tank tops and showing off your shoulders (3:28 - 3:32)
which is pretty much my only good muscle (3:29 - 3:33)
but (3:32 - 3:37)
not a single handsome gentleman (3:33 - 3:39)
has come up to me in the gym to (3:37 - 3:41)
compliment my pokemon wear (3:39 - 3:44)
so we are calling this a pokey (3:41 - 3:48)
fail 100 i am the only person at the gym (3:44 - 3:50)
wearing pokemon gear (3:48 - 3:52)
so that was their opportunity that (3:50 - 3:53)
they've missed out on (3:52 - 3:55)
i mean i'm tempted to actually buy the (3:53 - 3:57)
tank top now i definitely don't wear (3:55 - 3:57)
tank tops (3:57 - 3:59)
but i am tempted to buy it because i (3:57 - 4:01)
like that shirt so much it is so (3:59 - 4:03)
that i mean the one we're talking about (4:01 - 4:05)
is the one where actually points off (4:03 - 4:06)
because the (4:05 - 4:09)
uh logo is is tiny it's a small tiny (4:06 - 4:12)
like pikachu circle in the upper uh left (4:09 - 4:13)
breast (4:12 - 4:16)
portion of the shirt but the material (4:13 - 4:19)
is just amazingly soft and moisture (4:16 - 4:21)
wicking and it just feels so nice on (4:19 - 4:22)
your skin (4:21 - 4:24)
100 there speaking of pokemon center (4:22 - 4:26)
being down i guess that will be our (4:24 - 4:27)
first bit of news (4:26 - 4:30)
is what a disaster that skateboard was (4:27 - 4:30)
[Music] (4:30 - 4:32)
[Laughter] (4:30 - 4:36)
because our new uh thing on the show (4:32 - 4:38)
is to look up ebay prices or to search (4:36 - 4:39)
for japanese ice cream (4:38 - 4:42)
to find japanese zeroed cards pokemon (4:39 - 4:45)
skateboard i think is going for (4:42 - 4:48)
400 to 700 on ebay the pikachu (4:45 - 4:49)
skateboard (4:48 - 4:51)
specifically the 25th anniversary one we (4:49 - 4:53)
should say yes (4:51 - 4:55)
which was uh if you could buy it 250 (4:53 - 4:56)
dollars (4:55 - 4:58)
right i know last week when i was (4:56 - 4:59)
checking it was it was (4:58 - 5:01)
it was close to the high 700s i'm (4:59 - 5:03)
checking right now (5:01 - 5:05)
it looks like there's a lot of buy nows (5:03 - 5:07)
for about 500 (5:05 - 5:10)
um and there's one that's 420 with 14 (5:07 - 5:11)
bids on it (5:10 - 5:14)
another one at 405 with two bids yeah it (5:11 - 5:14)
looks like (5:14 - 5:16)
it looks like it came down a little bit (5:14 - 5:18)
in price the question that i have (5:16 - 5:20)
that it's kind of the moral quandary (5:18 - 5:22)
that i see whenever confronted with (5:20 - 5:23)
these things because my first (5:22 - 5:26)
knee-jerk reaction is anybody who bought (5:23 - 5:27)
the skateboard just because they wanted (5:26 - 5:29)
to resell it for a higher price (5:27 - 5:31)
is evil and they're keeping people who (5:29 - 5:33)
actually want the skateboard to have the (5:31 - 5:36)
skateboard from having the skateboard (5:33 - 5:37)
because they bring down the pokemon (5:36 - 5:39)
center site completely (5:37 - 5:42)
but is this an indication that they're (5:39 - 5:44)
just not charging enough (5:42 - 5:46)
they're not charging the right price for (5:44 - 5:48)
these handcrafted (5:46 - 5:51)
pokemon skateboards and okay that (5:48 - 5:54)
they should actually price them at five (5:51 - 5:56)
to seven hundred dollars (5:54 - 5:57)
and then because that's what people are (5:56 - 5:59)
going to have to end up paying anyways (5:57 - 6:01)
and kind of destroy that secondary (5:59 - 6:04)
market maybe (6:01 - 6:05)
i mean would that destroy the secondary (6:04 - 6:07)
market it would make that secondary (6:05 - 6:08)
market more expensive well i mean (6:07 - 6:10)
there's got to be a limit like (6:08 - 6:12)
nobody's going to spend two thousand (6:10 - 6:14)
dollars for a handcrafted pokemon (6:12 - 6:16)
pikachu skateboard now (6:14 - 6:19)
are they well okay i don't know so what (6:16 - 6:20)
happened was on tuesday (6:19 - 6:22)
they were supposed to go live at i think (6:20 - 6:24)
11 pacific time (6:22 - 6:27)
to easter the store was down (6:24 - 6:30)
and i got to a point where i could i (6:27 - 6:32)
could hit the add to cart button (6:30 - 6:34)
and then it would it would say like (6:32 - 6:36)
internal server error (6:34 - 6:38)
yeah that's where i got none of this is (6:36 - 6:41)
new this has happened multiple times (6:38 - 6:42)
we probably have covered it for like (6:41 - 6:44)
pokemon go fest (6:42 - 6:46)
early on and every concert that has (6:44 - 6:47)
existed (6:46 - 6:50)
playstation 5s and playstation 4s and (6:47 - 6:51)
wiis and (6:50 - 6:53)
well not wiius no one cared about that (6:51 - 6:55)
one but the other (6:53 - 6:58)
consoles that existed so it's not an (6:55 - 6:59)
issue with pokemon center (6:58 - 7:02)
specifically but if you s (6:59 - 7:04)
if you were able to get it into your (7:02 - 7:07)
cart on tuesday but not (7:04 - 7:09)
check out they sent an email tuesday (7:07 - 7:10)
evening saying like (7:09 - 7:12)
don't worry we didn't sell out of (7:10 - 7:15)
skateboards we'll have more on thursday (7:12 - 7:18)
so i don't know if they i don't know if (7:15 - 7:19)
they saw that (7:18 - 7:20)
the same people were getting through and (7:19 - 7:22)
buying the skateboards and they decided (7:20 - 7:24)
to like shut it down (7:22 - 7:26)
because on tuesday they had it set up (7:24 - 7:27)
where you (7:26 - 7:29)
before you even got or sorry on thursday (7:27 - 7:31)
before you even got to pokemon center (7:29 - 7:32)
you had to go through a capsica (7:31 - 7:34)
and you have to be you had to be like (7:32 - 7:36)
these six blocks or (7:34 - 7:38)
sidewalk and these two blocks or fire (7:36 - 7:40)
hydrant before you got there which i (7:38 - 7:42)
don't know if that completely stops bots (7:40 - 7:43)
like i'm not sure (7:42 - 7:47)
how the buying bots work to resell on (7:43 - 7:47)
ebay but (7:47 - 7:49)
at that point i'd even bother i don't (7:47 - 7:51)
know 250 was already at the high end (7:49 - 7:55)
and i feel for me it's like 250 (7:51 - 7:59)
plus two hours of your time on a website (7:55 - 8:00)
refreshing (7:59 - 8:03)
hoping something goes through is like a (8:00 - 8:04)
lot (8:03 - 8:06)
of dedication to something that you're (8:04 - 8:08)
gonna hang on your wall and be like yeah (8:06 - 8:09)
that's cool (8:08 - 8:12)
like i guess for me it would be that's (8:09 - 8:13)
correct (8:12 - 8:16)
a skateboard that you can't even ride i (8:13 - 8:18)
guess for me if if i could just (8:16 - 8:19)
spend the money get the instant (8:18 - 8:22)
gratification and not worry about (8:19 - 8:24)
refreshing a web page for two hours i'd (8:22 - 8:27)
be more inclined but even on thursday (8:24 - 8:29)
when i was like ah do i want this i was (8:27 - 8:30)
like ah the site is still loading slow (8:29 - 8:32)
and i'm still getting like (8:30 - 8:35)
temporary issues pikachu showing up (8:32 - 8:36)
there's a certain point where it's just (8:35 - 8:38)
not worth it i got the email (8:36 - 8:41)
saying i would that they were opening up (8:38 - 8:42)
on thursday (8:41 - 8:45)
but did i get as rude email no (8:42 - 8:49)
oh i still don't have that one yeah (8:45 - 8:52)
i get all your garbage come by stuff but (8:49 - 8:53)
the one time (8:52 - 8:55)
you're giving me the one thing i want i (8:53 - 8:57)
don't get the email (8:55 - 8:59)
well i especially appreciated also that (8:57 - 9:00)
i got an email saying (8:59 - 9:03)
hey this bear walker pikachu skateboard (9:00 - 9:05)
is now available on the pokemon center (9:03 - 9:09)
at 11 10 a.m that's right 10 minutes (9:05 - 9:11)
after it became available aka it's not (9:09 - 9:13)
available anymore (9:11 - 9:15)
they need to hire me as their official (9:13 - 9:17)
communications guru (9:15 - 9:19)
speaking of stuff not available anymore (9:17 - 9:20)
there was a (9:19 - 9:24)
tauros miltank in bufalant buffalotte (9:20 - 9:27)
boovalant max raid battle promoted event (9:24 - 9:28)
over the weekend (9:27 - 9:30)
which is actually the second one they (9:28 - 9:32)
did for the month this is the first time (9:30 - 9:32)
they did two (9:32 - 9:35)
they did their first ever a lot of first (9:32 - 9:37)
evers here first ever (9:35 - 9:40)
two events in one month and first ever (9:37 - 9:43)
repeat of an event so earlier (9:40 - 9:46)
this month they did the squivet repeat (9:43 - 9:47)
event (9:46 - 9:49)
um shortly after new year's they didn't (9:47 - 9:51)
really say why (9:49 - 9:53)
my suspicion would be well a bunch of (9:51 - 9:55)
people just got the game for christmas (9:53 - 9:58)
so why don't we re-run an event it was (9:55 - 9:59)
slightly different the first time they (9:58 - 10:01)
ran the school of an event you could (9:59 - 10:03)
only get shiny squavit (10:01 - 10:05)
the second time they ran it earlier this (10:03 - 10:08)
month was squivet and greed it could (10:05 - 10:09)
both be shiny i guess (10:08 - 10:11)
it doesn't really matter because you (10:09 - 10:12)
could just catch two squelve it and (10:11 - 10:13)
evolve one but (10:12 - 10:16)
they slightly changed it uh but is it (10:13 - 10:18)
chinese new year is that what it is year (10:16 - 10:19)
of the ox (10:18 - 10:21)
yeah this is about around the time of (10:19 - 10:23)
the year when chinese new year happens (10:21 - 10:25)
yeah to celebrate the year of the ox (10:23 - 10:27)
that's yeah i think that's chinese (10:25 - 10:29)
um yeah oh yeah well yes yes yes that (10:27 - 10:31)
was a chinese zodiac (10:29 - 10:32)
yeah yeah okay zodiac that's what it was (10:31 - 10:34)
i wasn't sure if it was like a (10:32 - 10:36)
constellation or something so (10:34 - 10:37)
it's the year of the ox it's technically (10:36 - 10:39)
february 12th (10:37 - 10:41)
there you go tauros military it's the (10:39 - 10:42)
year of the ox (10:41 - 10:44)
appearing in max raid battles lucky (10:42 - 10:46)
trainers can come across shiny tauros (10:44 - 10:48)
make sure you connect through mystery (10:46 - 10:50)
gift get wild area news you should see (10:48 - 10:51)
pillar of lights (10:50 - 10:54)
you can walk up to the event ends (10:51 - 10:56)
this event does not affect pokemon (10:54 - 10:57)
encounter with it within dynamics (10:56 - 10:58)
adventure (10:57 - 11:01)
anyways it was an okay event uh i found (10:58 - 11:02)
a shiny tauros (11:01 - 11:05)
i only maybe did it for like four hours (11:02 - 11:06)
i burned (11:05 - 11:10)
250 wishing pieces a lot it is a lot (11:06 - 11:11)
i gotta stock back up now for the next (11:10 - 11:13)
event how many shinies did you get just (11:11 - 11:14)
one (11:13 - 11:17)
nothing too fancy my problem with this (11:14 - 11:20)
is still as always feel like (11:17 - 11:24)
lack of communication it's like the one (11:20 - 11:25)
thing niantic does (11:24 - 11:28)
kind of okay (11:25 - 11:28)
well so niantic can push push and update (11:31 - 11:34)
in the game (11:33 - 11:37)
which is very useful because that's (11:34 - 11:38)
probably where most people would see the (11:37 - 11:40)
news in the game they're playing (11:38 - 11:42)
niantic gives you like a two week heads (11:40 - 11:44)
up at least which is (11:42 - 11:47)
also very nice to know like i mean (11:44 - 11:50)
sometimes sometimes it comes for at (11:47 - 11:51)
least community days they do (11:50 - 11:53)
like we've never had a community day (11:51 - 11:54)
that's where like oh i didn't know (11:53 - 11:55)
comedian day was (11:54 - 11:58)
now tomorrow like their community days (11:55 - 12:00)
are are pretty well established two to (11:58 - 12:02)
three weeks ahead of time (12:00 - 12:04)
we usually know when it's going to be we (12:02 - 12:06)
know the pokemon it's going to be (12:04 - 12:09)
so like at least in the sense of pokemon (12:06 - 12:10)
stuff (12:09 - 12:13)
in sorted shield if they were like hey (12:10 - 12:14)
in two weeks we're celebrating (12:13 - 12:18)
year of the ox for sword and shield (12:14 - 12:19)
it's gonna be shiny tauros you could at (12:18 - 12:22)
least be like okay i'm gonna plan (12:19 - 12:23)
this weekend off because i really like (12:22 - 12:25)
tauros or you could be like okay well i (12:23 - 12:27)
already had plans i'm not going to move (12:25 - 12:28)
them around because i don't care about (12:27 - 12:29)
toros but instead you have this like (12:28 - 12:31)
last minute thing of like (12:29 - 12:32)

surprises (12:39 - 12:43)
in video games i i do but this is not (12:40 - 12:44)
something that should be like a last (12:43 - 12:48)
minute surprise once a month (12:44 - 12:48)
it was nice the first couple times you (12:48 - 12:52)
did it now at this point (12:50 - 12:54)
you've been doing it every month just (12:52 - 12:56)
give us like a week heads up (12:54 - 12:58)
let us know and that way you can tweet (12:56 - 13:00)
it throughout the week because (12:58 - 13:02)
what happens is they put it on a blog (13:00 - 13:04)
post no one checks pokemon.com except (13:02 - 13:05)
this podcast (13:04 - 13:07)
and then they tweet it one time on like (13:05 - 13:09)
their play pokemon twitter account (13:07 - 13:12)

like i had tons of people come through (13:19 - 13:23)
my twitch stream being like is this new (13:21 - 13:25)
when did they start doing this like (13:23 - 13:26)
how do we know which like they just (13:25 - 13:28)
don't know that much about and i get (13:26 - 13:30)
some people just got the game recently (13:28 - 13:31)
for christmas but (13:30 - 13:32)
there's not even a name for it at least (13:31 - 13:34)
with community you go like oh (13:32 - 13:36)
community day that's the thing niantic (13:34 - 13:38)
does once a month for the like there's (13:36 - 13:38)
no this just (13:38 - 13:41)
encounter tauros miltank buff land but (13:38 - 13:43)
like they don't even have a clever name (13:41 - 13:46)
it's not promoted raids well that's (13:43 - 13:47)
confusing because there's promoted raids (13:46 - 13:49)
every month (13:47 - 13:51)
oh true i wonder if this year they're (13:49 - 13:52)
going to do two uh two a month (13:51 - 13:53)
i wonder if they're going to keep (13:52 - 13:55)
repeating like do one repeat do one new (13:53 - 13:57)
one which would be kind of cool because (13:55 - 13:59)
people missed earlier ones this is true (13:57 - 14:01)
i think that makes good (13:59 - 14:03)
sense to do it that way i mean they're (14:01 - 14:05)
obviously just trying to copy pokemon go (14:03 - 14:07)
and this is their version of a community (14:05 - 14:08)
day (14:07 - 14:11)
badly communicated and just read your (14:08 - 14:12)
news when you turn on your switch i saw (14:11 - 14:13)
it there this morning (14:12 - 14:15)
yeah oh yeah they do post it in the (14:13 - 14:18)
switch news area that is (14:15 - 14:20)
true i'm not sure how many people are (14:18 - 14:22)
reading that (14:20 - 14:22)
i don't get me either sometimes i (14:25 - 14:31)
vaguely acknowledge that there's (14:29 - 14:32)
something there (14:31 - 14:34)
before i just go straight into the game (14:32 - 14:36)
that i want to play like oh (14:34 - 14:40)
no there's a dot now it does have a dot (14:36 - 14:43)
normally okay this is some other uh news (14:40 - 14:44)
that probably no one (14:43 - 14:48)
knew but hey if you are looking (14:44 - 14:51)
for something to do pokemon geratina and (14:48 - 14:53)
the sky warrior is available (14:51 - 14:55)
free to watch on pokemon tv until (14:53 - 14:56)
february 5th (14:55 - 14:59)
i actually have not seen this movie in (14:56 - 15:00)
its entirety i've only seen like the (14:59 - 15:01)
first like (15:00 - 15:03)
30 minutes well guess what shaman's (15:01 - 15:05)
character doesn't improve throughout the (15:03 - 15:07)
entire film so prepared to be annoyed (15:05 - 15:08)
for the entire thing (15:07 - 15:10)
that's what i kind of liked the first 30 (15:08 - 15:12)
minutes though shaymin was real sassy (15:10 - 15:14)
i do kind of like when giratina splashes (15:12 - 15:16)
down in like the fjord or whatever it (15:14 - 15:16)
was (15:16 - 15:18)
there's an interesting kind of like (15:16 - 15:20)
visual there where would you rank this (15:18 - 15:21)
movie will (15:20 - 15:25)
in the whole pantheon of human cinema or (15:21 - 15:28)
just (15:25 - 15:28)
just in pokemon films i'm trying to (15:29 - 15:32)
remember (15:32 - 15:35)
anything about this movie i have not (15:32 - 15:37)
seen every pokemon film (15:35 - 15:40)
so that's a tough call would it be uh (15:37 - 15:40)
top (15:40 - 15:43)
half of pokemon movies or bottom half so (15:40 - 15:46)
i okay i this is the way i think i would (15:43 - 15:47)
put it (15:46 - 15:49)
it's gonna be at the at the bottom half (15:47 - 15:50)
because (15:49 - 15:53)
it is like do you know did you ever see (15:50 - 15:54)
godfather 3 (15:53 - 15:56)
no all right well godfather 3 shouldn't (15:54 - 15:57)
have been made (15:56 - 16:00)
it's like it's it's a sequel out there (15:57 - 16:02)
and it was like they they wanted to make (16:00 - 16:05)
a sequel but nobody wanted that sequel (16:02 - 16:07)
that's what this movie is it's a sequel (16:05 - 16:08)
that nobody (16:07 - 16:10)
really wanted you know er but what if (16:08 - 16:13)
you like shaman (16:10 - 16:16)
then you should see a professional (16:13 - 16:16)
because shaman is (16:17 - 16:23)
like really bottom tier pokemon out (16:20 - 16:24)
there yeah it's cute (16:23 - 16:26)
and it does some weird transformation (16:24 - 16:29)
from a hedgehog to a deer (16:26 - 16:32)
excuse and the sky forms a deer what (16:29 - 16:32)
with no (16:32 - 16:35)
wings what it's got its (16:32 - 16:39)
ears or wings or whatever oh my ears are (16:35 - 16:41)
wings whatever (16:39 - 16:42)
yeah we'll learn how to fly with them (16:41 - 16:45)
dumbo but it's not even like (16:42 - 16:47)
in the celebi movie the celebi is like (16:45 - 16:49)
oh celebi's so nice (16:47 - 16:52)
i like shaymin is not nice it it wins no (16:49 - 16:53)
points (16:52 - 16:56)
in any area i have to agree that it's in (16:53 - 16:57)
the bottom tier because (16:56 - 17:00)
i know i've seen this film and i (16:57 - 17:03)
remember nothing about it it's pollution (17:00 - 17:07)
and cleaning the pollution and (17:03 - 17:10)
happy environment land it's fern gully (17:07 - 17:11)
pokemon style (17:10 - 17:15)
does ash die uh i don't think ash dies (17:11 - 17:17)
but i i literally think it's the third (17:15 - 17:19)
in the arciest movies and it's like yeah (17:17 - 17:20)
it is (17:19 - 17:23)
serious can we can we be done now (17:20 - 17:25)
let's get through our pokemon go news (17:23 - 17:26)

yes there's absolutely no planning (18:01 - 18:05)
involved they just (18:04 - 18:08)
threw the dice no i mean i don't think (18:05 - 18:09)
they've like they could have done shiny (18:08 - 18:11)
miltank anytime in the last like three (18:09 - 18:11)
years (18:11 - 18:13)
i don't think they were saving shiny (18:11 - 18:15)

the last (19:55 - 19:59)
couple weeks slash months of pokemon go (19:56 - 20:01)
and me having these shiny legendaries (19:59 - 20:04)
and me not needing to do raids has been (20:01 - 20:07)
very good on my wallet wait what what's (20:04 - 20:10)
your current level in pokemon go 43. (20:07 - 20:12)
so you already did the 30 raids thing (20:10 - 20:14)
yeah because i got to do that and that's (20:12 - 20:17)
that um that's going to be a couple (20:14 - 20:18)
years i'm trying to think of like (20:17 - 20:21)
what like if i have a free raid pass (20:18 - 20:23)
yeah sure i'll do a sweet or i'll (20:21 - 20:24)
do a ryko or whatever (20:23 - 20:26)
i'm i'm curious how other people feel (20:24 - 20:27)
about this because i am not that (20:26 - 20:29)
collector that needs a (20:27 - 20:32)
hundred percent or a really good iv or i (20:29 - 20:33)
don't need (20:32 - 20:36)
like i'm good with a shiny and i'm just (20:33 - 20:37)
good with (20:36 - 20:39)
you know extra sweet coons like okay (20:37 - 20:40)
casual (20:39 - 20:42)
yeah i see where you're at but now that (20:40 - 20:44)
i have now that i have like (20:42 - 20:47)
a shiny reggie steel shiny red shiny (20:44 - 20:48)
reggie rock shiny (20:47 - 20:51)
entei suicune like i have them all so i (20:48 - 20:52)
have real no desire (20:51 - 20:55)
to do them like what am i gonna do with (20:52 - 20:56)
like (20:55 - 20:58)
i mean i have four shiny sweet coons (20:56 - 20:59)
because i got really lucky when we did (20:58 - 21:00)
that in dc well (20:59 - 21:03)
but i what am i well it doesn't matter (21:00 - 21:05)
why would i spend a dollar on (21:03 - 21:06)
something i don't need to do anything (21:05 - 21:08)
with see (21:06 - 21:10)
i mean i guess you need to get to the (21:08 - 21:11)
game (21:10 - 21:13)
you need to get to my level where you (21:11 - 21:15)
think why would i spend a dollar (21:13 - 21:19)
on indian list okay hold on i take it (21:15 - 21:20)
back there's there's two situations i (21:19 - 21:22)
would do it one is if i didn't have it (21:20 - 21:24)
and two if greg was like hey we're (21:22 - 21:26)
trying to do a suicune (21:24 - 21:27)
we only have three people we would (21:26 - 21:29)
really need your help i would spend the (21:27 - 21:30)
dollar to help out greg (21:29 - 21:32)
oh i see how it is (21:30 - 21:34)
[Laughter] (21:32 - 21:36)
but other than that i'm just i'm just (21:34 - 21:38)
curious of the (21:36 - 21:41)
the there are other people like me (21:38 - 21:44)
or similar to me where once they get (21:41 - 21:47)
a shiny of a pokemon in go (21:44 - 21:49)
specifically through raids they probably (21:47 - 21:51)
just don't have the desire to do the (21:49 - 21:52)
raids again (21:51 - 21:54)
but i suppose the whales probably cancel (21:52 - 21:56)
that out i suppose the whales will (21:54 - 21:57)
always (21:56 - 22:00)
cancel everything out yeah very true (21:57 - 22:02)
speaking of the (22:00 - 22:05)
these events did you guys complete your (22:02 - 22:06)
neither of you did the (22:05 - 22:08)
new unova one you didn't do the cinna (22:06 - 22:10)
one did you guys finish the hoenn one (22:08 - 22:12)
i just started the show saying i (22:10 - 22:14)
finished the hoe and one well look that (22:12 - 22:15)
wasn't (22:14 - 22:16)
look right now because there's a (22:15 - 22:18)
possibility i may (22:16 - 22:21)
have oops i have sound on for my go i (22:18 - 22:22)
know (22:21 - 22:25)
this particular program uh owen (22:22 - 22:26)
collection (22:25 - 22:29)
challenge i have zero check marks oh my (22:26 - 22:29)
god (22:29 - 22:33)
zero check marks wait greg why did you (22:29 - 22:35)
complete the hoenn challenge but you (22:33 - 22:38)
didn't complete the sinnoh or the unova (22:35 - 22:41)
because actually likes owen's the best (22:38 - 22:42)
region of course i'm gonna complete the (22:41 - 22:43)
hoenn challenge (22:42 - 22:46)
i will do none of the jodo challenge (22:43 - 22:50)
the worst region out there zero (22:46 - 22:53)
if i ha if the option presents itself to (22:50 - 22:55)
catch one of them (22:53 - 22:57)
i'll be torn on throwing that actual (22:55 - 22:58)
pokeball (22:57 - 23:00)
why is maureep featured in the incense (22:58 - 23:04)
day it's not even a hoe in pokemon (23:00 - 23:06)
oh right now because it can turn into a (23:04 - 23:07)
dragon oh yeah yeah (23:06 - 23:10)
yeah they released the the ampharos yeah (23:07 - 23:12)
mega and ferocious (23:10 - 23:15)
mega ampharos see my problem is (23:12 - 23:17)
at this point in the year let's blame it (23:15 - 23:18)
on the (23:17 - 23:20)
weather and temperatures and etc i'm (23:18 - 23:22)
only catching pokemon that throw (23:20 - 23:23)
themselves at me (23:22 - 23:25)
i'm not going out and looking for them (23:23 - 23:27)
and you know what this morning when i (23:25 - 23:29)
opened up pokemon go it was a drill bird (23:27 - 23:31)
jober is not on that list of hoe and (23:29 - 23:32)
pokemon i caught me a (23:31 - 23:35)
gilbert but that's as far as it went i (23:32 - 23:36)
mean (23:35 - 23:38)
i did go out yesterday for the sole (23:36 - 23:40)
purpose of completing the challenge (23:38 - 23:42)
also because i could not sit but not (23:40 - 23:43)
snow well (23:42 - 23:45)
it was before it started snowing because (23:43 - 23:46)
i knew the snow was coming and we had to (23:45 - 23:47)
go to costco (23:46 - 23:49)
so i went out ahead of time uh and did a (23:47 - 23:51)
bunch of (23:49 - 23:54)
hit all the weird spots that are in my (23:51 - 23:55)
neighborhood because there's a lot of (23:54 - 23:56)
them and it's a really easy driving (23:55 - 23:58)
pattern (23:56 - 24:00)
and then the few flakes started so i (23:58 - 24:01)
went i didn't (24:00 - 24:03)
complete it i completed the rest of it (24:01 - 24:04)
today but then i went home and grabbed (24:03 - 24:06)
brent and then we went to costco (24:04 - 24:07)
because we had to get to costco because (24:06 - 24:09)
i needed my giant uh (24:07 - 24:12)
jug of soy sauce and you're 16 pounds of (24:09 - 24:13)
cream cheese (24:12 - 24:15)
no we didn't do we didn't buy cream (24:13 - 24:16)
cheese there not this time (24:15 - 24:19)
we did buy way why are you buying a jug (24:16 - 24:22)
of soy sauce are you trying to murder me (24:19 - 24:25)
yes no oh i i marinate (24:22 - 24:28)
my weekly lunch your chicken your (24:25 - 24:28)
poisons (24:28 - 24:31)
in the soy sauce i do soy sauce and lime (24:28 - 24:32)
juice (24:31 - 24:34)
to marinate my chicken before i cook it (24:32 - 24:36)
for my lunch for the week (24:34 - 24:38)
plus i love soy sauce like i know not to (24:36 - 24:39)

whole lot (24:55 - 24:59)
yeah but that's like your thing (24:55 - 25:01)
catching pokemon like like you like (24:59 - 25:03)
collecting things i do (25:01 - 25:06)

issue with it (25:06 - 25:08)

a million times don't you like getting a (25:17 - 25:21)
new pokemon game like whenever (25:19 - 25:24)

but that's awesome but but also it's (25:29 - 25:34)
because that's a new game right pokemon (25:33 - 25:36)
go is not a new game (25:34 - 25:39)
this is a new event i mean (25:36 - 25:42)
some would argue with the uh pokemon (25:39 - 25:46)
go beyond update it is a new game (25:42 - 25:49)
it is not a new game it is the same game (25:46 - 25:51)
my only problem with the collection (25:49 - 25:52)
challenge (25:51 - 25:55)
i okay so i i did see a few people being (25:52 - 25:58)
like collection challenge is bad because (25:55 - 26:00)
i can't find the shadow pokemon but (25:58 - 26:01)
that's what i like (26:00 - 26:03)
they added like difficulty to it last (26:01 - 26:04)
week by (26:03 - 26:07)
you going out and exploring which is (26:04 - 26:09)
like the point of the game which is the (26:07 - 26:10)
point of the game i like (26:09 - 26:13)
and being like oh does this grunt have a (26:10 - 26:15)
cloister or do they have the (26:13 - 26:18)
snover like that is fun and exciting to (26:15 - 26:18)
me like i (26:18 - 26:20)
am the person in sword and shield that's (26:18 - 26:23)
like well there's a one percent (26:20 - 26:25)
drampa here i'm going to keep doing it (26:23 - 26:27)
until the drampa shows up (26:25 - 26:28)
and then when it should thrill of the (26:27 - 26:30)
hunt and then when it shows up i'm going (26:28 - 26:31)
to catch it (26:30 - 26:33)
where i do have like a million drama in (26:31 - 26:35)
my pc i could have just moved it over (26:33 - 26:37)
and then put it in the daycare or (26:35 - 26:39)
like i like rare stuff i like the thrill (26:37 - 26:40)
of the hunt (26:39 - 26:41)
my problem with the collection challenge (26:40 - 26:43)
is why is there only like eight or nine (26:41 - 26:45)
pokemon there are (26:43 - 26:48)
give why is what else isn't hoeing (26:45 - 26:50)
rosalia why was rosalia not on this list (26:48 - 26:52)
i got a lot of (26:50 - 26:54)
and rosetta community is coming up why (26:52 - 26:56)
is makitu not on this list (26:54 - 26:58)
why is carvana on this list i'm looking (26:56 - 26:59)
at them all right right now why are you (26:58 - 27:01)
not on this list like just giving them (26:59 - 27:02)
all no (27:01 - 27:04)
just give me more things to catch i'm (27:02 - 27:06)
seeing them anyways all the time (27:04 - 27:09)
you're giving us a whole week i had the (27:06 - 27:12)
thrill of catching it the first time (27:09 - 27:15)
and i still have that memory there's (27:12 - 27:17)
nothing (27:15 - 27:19)
it's not like ooh i caught this one (27:17 - 27:20)
outside (27:19 - 27:23)
my house unlike the 15 other times i (27:20 - 27:25)
caught it outside my house (27:23 - 27:27)
when i was in japan i was like oh (27:25 - 27:31)
japanese central i need this (27:27 - 27:33)
there's nothing different about it it (27:31 - 27:36)
says it was caught in japan (27:33 - 27:40)
yeah nobody cares no nobody cares (27:36 - 27:44)
exactly i don't care (27:40 - 27:48)
i have a japanese farfetch'd a taiwanese (27:44 - 27:52)
american farfetch i mean (27:48 - 27:54)
i like like if i'm playing the game the (27:52 - 27:55)
very first time like (27:54 - 27:59)
in shield i generally just caught things (27:55 - 28:01)
as i saw them on the route because (27:59 - 28:02)
eventually i'll need to complete that (28:01 - 28:05)
pokedex and they do the thing (28:02 - 28:08)
where they hold access to home (28:05 - 28:11)
or bank until two months after so you (28:08 - 28:12)
can't complete the pokedex anyways (28:11 - 28:15)
that's a very different experience than (28:12 - 28:16)
here's an event (28:15 - 28:18)
in the game where you can still see them (28:16 - 28:20)
in my box (28:18 - 28:24)
i can point to them i can highlight them (28:20 - 28:27)
100 agree i caught this (28:24 - 28:30)
why do i have to catch this again isn't (28:27 - 28:31)
steve the guy (28:30 - 28:34)
who's always harping about uh like (28:31 - 28:35)
respect my time (28:34 - 28:37)
yes you get this you get rewards for (28:35 - 28:39)
right disrespect (28:37 - 28:42)
my time rewards for it what about the (28:39 - 28:44)
time in the past that i spent getting (28:42 - 28:45)
these dudes (28:44 - 28:47)
yeah that's that now that's (28:45 - 28:49)
disrespecting that (28:47 - 28:51)
past time so only current time deserves (28:49 - 28:55)
respect and all the time in the past (28:51 - 28:55)
i do have you seen my bag and pokemon go (28:57 - 29:03)
i am overflowing with candy (29:00 - 29:07)
there will never be a need for me to (29:03 - 29:08)
have (29:07 - 29:10)
xl candy for a ninketa (29:08 - 29:14)
[Laughter] (29:10 - 29:17)
uh you know i can't disagree with you (29:14 - 29:18)
there (29:17 - 29:21)
there will never ever ever ever ever (29:18 - 29:21)
ever (29:21 - 29:25)
ever be a reason to have any candy (29:21 - 29:28)
for a plusel or a miner never (29:25 - 29:30)
never are you ever gonna do anything but (29:28 - 29:32)
shove them in the box and say (29:30 - 29:34)
look you two cuties why don't you go (29:32 - 29:36)
play together away from me because (29:34 - 29:38)
basically you're useless i got shiny (29:36 - 29:39)
ones (29:38 - 29:42)
i don't have shiny ones (29:39 - 29:42)
all right well let's take a break uh (29:42 - 29:47)
when we come back we're gonna talk about (29:45 - 29:48)
some (29:47 - 29:50)
i don't well we talk about leaks every (29:48 - 29:51)
now and then (29:50 - 29:54)
uh pokemon unite has been in beta in (29:51 - 29:57)
china for quite a bit of time and there (29:54 - 29:58)
are there are some leaks i think it's (29:57 - 29:59)
interesting to talk about i guess if you (29:58 - 30:01)
don't want anything spoiled for this (29:59 - 30:02)
game you can skip that segment but (30:01 - 30:03)
when we come back we're going to be (30:02 - 30:06)

electric leg tube leg tubes (30:33 - 30:39)
tube leg two leg two with leg (30:36 - 30:42)
tubes two warmers well then they're just (30:39 - 30:43)

[Music] (31:36 - 31:45)
and we are back uh before we get to the (31:41 - 31:45)
pokemon (31:45 - 31:49)
you night stuff vgc competitive (31:45 - 31:52)
stuff is changing again uh we were on (31:49 - 31:56)
series seven rules ever since (31:52 - 31:58)
november first i think cause crown (31:56 - 31:59)
tundra came out (31:58 - 32:03)
yeah the end of october so yeah (31:59 - 32:06)
series 7 was november 1st through (32:03 - 32:08)
the end of this month so three whole (32:06 - 32:09)
months of series seven (32:08 - 32:13)
which was the main change was they added (32:09 - 32:16)
you could already use legendary pokemon (32:13 - 32:17)
like kobelian (32:16 - 32:20)
and tarakian for example but because the (32:17 - 32:22)
crown tundra added the rest of the (32:20 - 32:23)
legendary pokemon (32:22 - 32:26)
uh you were allowed to use like landorus (32:23 - 32:26)
or (32:26 - 32:29)
thunderous or tornados or cresselia for (32:26 - 32:30)
example (32:29 - 32:33)
so that obviously switched up a lot as (32:30 - 32:36)
well as the introduction of glastrier (32:33 - 32:37)
and spectrier (32:36 - 32:39)
which were two very popular pokemon (32:37 - 32:41)
being used competitively as well (32:39 - 32:44)
but now series 8 rules were announced (32:41 - 32:45)
this is off (32:44 - 32:49)
daily daily esports.gg (32:45 - 32:53)
uh you are allowed to use one (32:49 - 32:56)
restricted legendary pokemon which (32:53 - 32:59)
in the sun and moon series you are (32:56 - 33:00)
allowed to use (32:59 - 33:02)
two but they're saying you're allowed to (33:00 - 33:04)
use one here (33:02 - 33:07)
there's also no blue orb or red orb so (33:04 - 33:09)
you can't get primals which is probably (33:07 - 33:11)
a good thing (33:09 - 33:12)
but uh if you want to know the (33:11 - 33:14)
restrictive legendary pokemon most of (33:12 - 33:16)
these are box pokemon (33:14 - 33:17)
um there's some exceptions here like (33:16 - 33:20)
mewtwo but we have mewtwo lugia (33:17 - 33:23)
kyogre groudon rayquaza dialga palkia (33:20 - 33:27)
giratina reshram zekram kirim (33:23 - 33:30)
xerneas yivital or yveltal (33:27 - 33:33)
zygarde cosmog cosmoam so well no one's (33:30 - 33:35)
using cosmog or cosmo but they're (33:33 - 33:38)
technically restricted so galio lunala (33:35 - 33:41)
necrozma zashian zamazenta (33:38 - 33:44)
eternius eternitus and uh (33:41 - 33:47)
calorex fused with glastrier or (33:44 - 33:48)
spectrier (33:47 - 33:51)
only the fused one unconfused is fine (33:48 - 33:54)
you could use a fused one (33:51 - 33:56)
with an unfused one so you could use (33:54 - 33:57)
this i was going to say yeah (33:56 - 33:59)
they count as two separate pokemon when (33:57 - 34:00)
it's fused it counts as (33:59 - 34:03)
one restricted one it's so you like on (34:00 - 34:04)
my team right now my series seven i have (34:03 - 34:06)
both glass tree or and spectre are on my (34:04 - 34:07)
team (34:06 - 34:10)
i call it dose horses because doses too (34:07 - 34:14)
so i could do glass deer and spectre (34:10 - 34:16)
and calorics riding on one of the two (34:14 - 34:18)
because technically it's not glassy or (34:16 - 34:19)
spectra it's (34:18 - 34:22)
calorics which is weird to think about (34:19 - 34:23)
it's like when necrozma takes over (34:22 - 34:25)
solgaleo and it's (34:23 - 34:28)
dawn wings necrozma but it's not (34:25 - 34:30)
even though it looks like sogalia not (34:28 - 34:32)
don sorry duskman (34:30 - 34:34)
i don't know which legendary is going to (34:32 - 34:35)
be (34:34 - 34:38)
super good here i mean like (34:35 - 34:40)
no no mewtwo is going to be like besides (34:38 - 34:42)
cosmog because mom no one's using me (34:40 - 34:45)
too but okay so like the reason kyogre (34:42 - 34:48)
and groudon were so good is because then (34:45 - 34:50)
one of their abilities um like kyogre (34:48 - 34:52)
has drizzle groudon has (34:50 - 34:55)
the sun one drought so those those are (34:52 - 34:57)
good in itself because of weather (34:55 - 34:58)
but they were also good because of the (34:57 - 35:00)
blue orb and the red orb (34:58 - 35:02)
xerneas has always been good because of (35:00 - 35:03)
geomancy (35:02 - 35:06)
uh yveltal has always been good so gail (35:03 - 35:08)
and elena not so much but i think the (35:06 - 35:12)
necrozma that is lunala as well dawn (35:08 - 35:13)
wings i think is really good because of (35:12 - 35:14)
their ability (35:13 - 35:16)
uh zamasunte is a garbage pokemon as (35:14 - 35:18)
much as i love zamasunta (35:16 - 35:20)
zashina is the better of the two there (35:18 - 35:22)
kazashian (35:20 - 35:25)
has a crazy high attack stat plus it (35:22 - 35:27)
boosts its attack stat once it ends up (35:25 - 35:28)
in battle plus its typing is really good (35:27 - 35:30)
it's very steel or (35:28 - 35:34)
steel fairy so i'm not i'm not sure (35:30 - 35:37)
what happens in a meta game where you (35:34 - 35:38)
can have a calorics and you can have (35:37 - 35:39)
azashian (35:38 - 35:43)
and xerneas is back (35:39 - 35:47)
in form uh so it'll be interesting uh i (35:43 - 35:48)
guess we don't know how long it will (35:47 - 35:51)
last well we do know how long it will (35:48 - 35:53)
last it will go from february 1st (35:51 - 35:57)
to april 30th and then (35:53 - 36:01)
i i don't know may 1st do they allow two (35:57 - 36:04)
legends instead of one uh do they do a (36:01 - 36:04)
ban (36:04 - 36:07)
do they ban pokemon uh we don't know (36:04 - 36:08)
what happens at that point but (36:07 - 36:11)
i feel like they would ban at that point (36:08 - 36:13)
right like okay we played with it for (36:11 - 36:14)
right now let's see what happens when we (36:13 - 36:15)
take them away (36:14 - 36:17)
and then the one after it's like you can (36:15 - 36:19)
have all the legendaries (36:17 - 36:21)
just go crazy well yeah i was gonna say (36:19 - 36:23)
they'll do like the tier thing and (36:21 - 36:25)
they'll do like the top ten (36:23 - 36:27)
get knocked out again like they've done (36:25 - 36:28)
before yeah (36:27 - 36:30)
well top 10 yeah i guess we'll have to (36:28 - 36:32)
see what top 10 is but (36:30 - 36:34)
like top 10 right now is i know top (36:32 - 36:35)
three right now are (36:34 - 36:39)
urshifu tapu finney and incineroar (36:35 - 36:41)
i'm also curious how hershey foo fits in (36:39 - 36:44)
with all these like new pokemon (36:41 - 36:46)
it'll be interesting um but hey good for (36:44 - 36:48)
them for (36:46 - 36:50)
keeping the game fresh i guess speaking (36:48 - 36:53)
of (36:50 - 36:53)
freshness (36:53 - 36:59)
pokemon unite so this is uh (36:55 - 37:03)
this is january 15th off dota (36:59 - 37:05)
dot dot esports i don't know why i said (37:03 - 37:06)
dota (37:05 - 37:08)
dot esports new leaks reportedly show (37:06 - 37:11)
off skins and other details (37:08 - 37:13)
the leaks came from centro pokemon a (37:11 - 37:14)
website (37:13 - 37:16)
known for reliably spreading early (37:14 - 37:20)
information i don't agree with that (37:16 - 37:20)
sentence (37:21 - 37:24)
i would say a website known for (37:23 - 37:26)
spreading early information i would (37:24 - 37:27)
remove the word (37:26 - 37:30)
reliably well no just change (37:27 - 37:33)
what uh what (37:30 - 37:37)
reliably is (37:33 - 37:38)
you can rely on them to spread (37:37 - 37:40)
information whether that information is (37:38 - 37:44)
true or not well okay i agree with the (37:40 - 37:45)
sentence now (37:44 - 37:47)
okay so this is kind of hard because uh (37:45 - 37:49)
this is an audio podcast but they showed (37:47 - 37:50)
some skins (37:49 - 37:52)
that are available i'm going to try to (37:50 - 37:53)
describe them to you (37:52 - 37:56)
i believe this stuff should have been uh (37:53 - 38:00)
nda just like how (37:56 - 38:03)
pokemon go was available in australia (38:00 - 38:05)
like two months early and if you took a (38:03 - 38:07)
screenshot of something it had your (38:05 - 38:09)
trainer id on it so niantic could (38:07 - 38:11)
pinpoint who was the one sharing the (38:09 - 38:12)
information and stuff (38:11 - 38:14)
but we we know a couple things from (38:12 - 38:16)
what's going on here so in the (38:14 - 38:17)
screenshot we have (38:16 - 38:20)
we see a lucario uh score but um (38:17 - 38:23)
cinderace uh greninja mr mime (38:20 - 38:26)
a talonflame and a guard chomp so i'm (38:23 - 38:27)
pretty sure at least (38:26 - 38:31)
as up to what we know mr mime was not a (38:27 - 38:33)
confirmed playable character (38:31 - 38:35)
when they originally showed the trailer (38:33 - 38:36)
so now (38:35 - 38:38)
they are and i think cinderella's was (38:36 - 38:40)
also not shown early but now they are (38:38 - 38:42)
i thought i thought cinderace was oh (38:40 - 38:44)
okay maybe um (38:42 - 38:46)
i don't yeah i don't remember but i (38:44 - 38:48)
thought cinderace was the only one yeah (38:46 - 38:50)
mr mime is the one that i thought oh (38:48 - 38:52)
okay (38:50 - 38:53)
mr bob's in this game (38:52 - 38:55)
[Laughter] (38:53 - 38:59)
the lucario is dressed as zorro (38:55 - 39:02)
i guess is probably my best bet no (38:59 - 39:03)
he's dressed in the outfit that's in (39:02 - 39:06)
that one lucario movie (39:03 - 39:10)
oh zorro yes (39:06 - 39:14)
so zoro the moment they go back in time (39:10 - 39:18)
and he matches his trainer oh the one (39:14 - 39:18)
with (39:18 - 39:21)
uh the like three million year war (39:18 - 39:25)
and stuff yeah i think it's that outfit (39:21 - 39:29)
maybe i get yeah sure (39:25 - 39:31)
i mean it's more of a reference than (39:29 - 39:32)
zorro (39:31 - 39:35)
i mean it's very fitting to lucario i (39:32 - 39:36)
would say (39:35 - 39:39)
here it's not surprising then we have a (39:36 - 39:41)
score bunny in a pirate outfit i think (39:39 - 39:43)
that's probably the best way to describe (39:41 - 39:44)
it (39:43 - 39:46)
yes pirate king score button and then we (39:44 - 39:47)
have a greninja (39:46 - 39:50)
in what i believe to be like a power (39:47 - 39:51)
ranger outfit (39:50 - 39:54)
specifically the green ranger oh (39:51 - 39:58)
sure yeah except no helmet (39:54 - 40:00)
no helmet no helmet but he has like a (39:58 - 40:02)
little he has a kind of like though (40:00 - 40:04)
it was a greninja that's true he has (40:02 - 40:05)
like kind of (40:04 - 40:08)
like the morpher on his belt it looks (40:05 - 40:08)
like (40:08 - 40:10)
well they each have a pokeball featured (40:08 - 40:13)
somewhere as part of the item (40:10 - 40:16)
yeah yeah and then we have a mr mime in (40:13 - 40:19)
circus okay yeah he's a ring master (40:16 - 40:23)
yeah a yellow ring master outfit (40:19 - 40:26)
and then we have like a newspaper (40:23 - 40:28)
delivery talent flame (40:26 - 40:31)
it's newsies talonflame that is so (40:28 - 40:33)
weird he feels like that is not as weird (40:31 - 40:34)
as the next one (40:33 - 40:36)
he has like actually the newspaper cap (40:34 - 40:38)
and then he has like a gray scarf (40:36 - 40:41)
and then finally we have beach dad (40:38 - 40:42)
garchomp (40:41 - 40:45)
it's a garchomp with a hawaiian shirt on (40:42 - 40:46)
with a (40:45 - 40:49)
what are those called pool mask it's a (40:46 - 40:53)
scuba man don't wear that in the pool (40:49 - 40:57)
unless you want to look like a fool (40:53 - 40:57)
you wear goggles instead (40:57 - 41:02)
you're in a pool you don't need to wear (41:00 - 41:08)
anything on your face (41:02 - 41:08)
if there's too much chlorine yes okay (41:12 - 41:16)
the other thing (41:15 - 41:18)
in this screenshot is that i sent y'all (41:16 - 41:20)
pictures from that movie (41:18 - 41:24)
all right i'm looking at them yeah maybe (41:20 - 41:27)
it's the same cape and bag on the side (41:24 - 41:28)
and same hat shape (41:27 - 41:32)
okay yeah okay the bag the bag does (41:28 - 41:35)
line up maybe all right (41:32 - 41:37)
it's pretty it's pretty close okay the (41:35 - 41:38)
other thing to take away from the (41:37 - 41:39)
screenshot is there's some (41:38 - 41:41)
currency as associated with it and i'm (41:39 - 41:43)
not sure what to make of this currency (41:41 - 41:46)
so it's starbursts star pieces it's it's (41:43 - 41:47)
3 (41:46 - 41:51)
100 star pieces (41:47 - 41:54)
for the lucario 3150 for the score bunny (41:51 - 41:56)
and i don't know maybe because greninja (41:54 - 41:56)
is (41:56 - 42:01)
discounted or it's a sale it's 1260. (41:56 - 42:03)
so i don't know if that's like i don't (42:01 - 42:05)
think it's 31.50 (42:03 - 42:09)
i know i doubt that but i'd be though (42:05 - 42:10)
look pokemon tax (42:09 - 42:12)
yeah i also don't think it's like three (42:10 - 42:15)
maybe it is like three dollars and (42:12 - 42:18)
15 cents i don't know probably not (42:15 - 42:21)
three dollars how much is an outfit in (42:18 - 42:23)
league of legends or (42:21 - 42:26)
dota who who are you asking (42:23 - 42:29)
one of you neither of us plays league of (42:26 - 42:30)
legends or (42:29 - 42:33)
dota so how much are hats (42:30 - 42:36)
in dota the first thing that came up is (42:33 - 42:38)
dota worth playing (42:36 - 42:40)
yes dota is fun if you enjoy that kind (42:38 - 42:41)
of a game (42:40 - 42:43)
yeah i don't know how much a hat is in (42:41 - 42:45)
dota in this article it says (42:43 - 42:48)
somebody paid 15 for a fancy jacket in (42:45 - 42:50)
battlefield heroes (42:48 - 42:52)
you know i wouldn't actually now that (42:50 - 42:53)
i'm thinking about it how (42:52 - 42:55)
like a skin in apex legend is like 20 (42:53 - 42:56)
dollars (42:55 - 43:01)
what what do the skins have magical (42:56 - 43:01)
powers (43:01 - 43:06)
no it's actually unreal how expensive (43:01 - 43:08)
like if you want a skin for a gun or a (43:06 - 43:10)
skin for a character it's like (43:08 - 43:14)
between 15 to 20 dollars per skin (43:10 - 43:17)
oh heck no no way and it's been that way (43:14 - 43:19)
for almost two years because apex is (43:17 - 43:21)
going on two years and they haven't (43:19 - 43:23)
changed it so it's clearly working right (43:21 - 43:25)
like somebody is buying these (43:23 - 43:29)
i'm not i i think young people (43:25 - 43:32)
who have misguided priorities that's (43:29 - 43:33)
your market right there (43:32 - 43:36)
what if you really like a character then (43:33 - 43:37)
play that character (43:36 - 43:40)
in its regular clothes so (43:37 - 43:44)
the recently released collegiate attire (43:40 - 43:48)
in final fantasy 14 on the mog station (43:44 - 43:51)
is 18 yep that's (43:48 - 43:54)
wait can i get georgetown gear in final (43:51 - 43:56)
fantasy 14 (43:54 - 43:59)
uh maybe (43:56 - 44:00)
i don't know what the georgetown gear (43:59 - 44:02)
looks like well i mean it would be blue (44:00 - 44:03)
and gray (44:02 - 44:05)
well you could probably dye it blue and (44:03 - 44:07)
gray and it would say georgetown on it (44:05 - 44:08)
well what's collegiate about the (44:07 - 44:10)
collegiate gear (44:08 - 44:13)
i don't even know what that word means (44:10 - 44:15)
it means (44:13 - 44:18)
representing your college yeah oh this (44:15 - 44:18)
is (44:18 - 44:21)
bunk this is not even (44:18 - 44:25)
u.s collegiate this is like if you're a (44:21 - 44:29)
fancy british person no pass (44:25 - 44:32)
no dot esports is also reporting that it (44:29 - 44:33)
wasn't shown (44:32 - 44:34)
in this screenshot but there was a (44:33 - 44:36)
machamp wearing swimming trunks (44:34 - 44:39)
and a lay if you go to the tweet you can (44:36 - 44:40)
see it (44:39 - 44:42)
oh i see it i see it i see it uh we also (44:40 - 44:44)
have some new characters that were (44:42 - 44:47)
not shown before so i think we i think (44:44 - 44:48)
they showed snorlax originally (44:47 - 44:50)
yes and i think they showed gardevoir (44:48 - 44:52)
originally yes it looks like there's an (44:50 - 44:54)
absolute being added (44:52 - 44:56)
yeah and a cr crust (44:54 - 44:59)
[Laughter] (44:56 - 45:02)
crossover oh i i know who it is i'm just (44:59 - 45:03)
not sure who uh (45:02 - 45:04)
you know there's like i don't know like (45:03 - 45:07)
800 some pokemon and somebody decided (45:04 - 45:09)
crustal was a (45:07 - 45:12)
option i guess maybe (45:09 - 45:14)
just to maintain balance man yeah very (45:12 - 45:16)
defensive pokemon i would assume (45:14 - 45:19)
you know we know about alolan nine tails (45:16 - 45:20)
no that one is also new (45:19 - 45:21)
then we have a venusaur charizard (45:20 - 45:23)
blastoise i don't think anyone's (45:21 - 45:24)
surprised about those three (45:23 - 45:27)
you gotta pander appropriately pikachu (45:24 - 45:28)
of course (45:27 - 45:30)
nine tails there's a pikachu in this (45:28 - 45:33)
game whoa whoa slow down (45:30 - 45:36)
a lot nighttime is a cool choice yeah (45:33 - 45:40)
oh so there was another tweet from pokes (45:36 - 45:41)
it looks like that tweet oh i found (45:40 - 45:43)
iphone i was like did it get deleted (45:41 - 45:47)
it shows what looks to be the (45:43 - 45:50)
probably like the switch icon which was (45:47 - 45:51)
like a score bunny and a greninja and (45:50 - 45:54)
then it said pokemon unite in the corner (45:51 - 45:56)
uh and then they also confirmed that (45:54 - 45:59)
kramer ant will be a playable character (45:56 - 46:01)
and they have it next to the crustal in (45:59 - 46:03)
another screenshot so that looks pretty (46:01 - 46:07)
pretty real i guess there was a couple (46:03 - 46:08)
not in this article but there was a (46:07 - 46:10)
couple of screenshots that showed (46:08 - 46:11)
different app icons for the nintendo (46:10 - 46:13)
switch like they were probably testing (46:11 - 46:14)
which (46:13 - 46:16)
i guess i guess you test for that you (46:14 - 46:17)
like put out (46:16 - 46:19)
yeah absolutely what is more when you're (46:17 - 46:21)
like scrolling through (46:19 - 46:24)
like the e-shop or the switch store like (46:21 - 46:28)
what icon grabs people's attention yeah (46:24 - 46:29)
very curious of how much these character (46:28 - 46:31)
skins are gonna actually cost (46:29 - 46:33)
i mean if it's free to play and that's (46:31 - 46:34)
how they're making their money yeah (46:33 - 46:36)
it's not gonna be cheap it's not gonna (46:34 - 46:38)
be cheap the real question is how cheap (46:36 - 46:40)
is the pokemon community (46:38 - 46:42)
that we actually pay for these things (46:40 - 46:44)
how cheap is the community did you not (46:42 - 46:45)
look at (46:44 - 46:49)
should not look at pokemon go sales (46:45 - 46:52)
true it was depends i mean the game had (46:49 - 46:54)
best be fun that people want to pay (46:52 - 46:54)
money (46:54 - 46:58)
so yeah i but also are pokemon go (46:54 - 46:59)
players (46:58 - 47:01)
going to be playing pokemon unite i (46:59 - 47:02)
don't know if there's an overlap with (47:01 - 47:04)
moba players (47:02 - 47:08)
um probably not but i mean if there are (47:04 - 47:10)
moba players that have already sunk in a (47:08 - 47:11)
lot of money and they like pokemon i (47:10 - 47:12)
don't see why they wouldn't sink in a (47:11 - 47:14)
lot of money here (47:12 - 47:16)
true i think pokemon go players are like (47:14 - 47:18)
the hardcore whales of pokemon go i (47:16 - 47:19)
don't think anything's going to pry them (47:18 - 47:20)
away from it (47:19 - 47:23)
no speaking of money this is our our (47:20 - 47:25)
last thing we're gonna cover for the (47:23 - 47:29)
episode uh is it was a tweet (47:25 - 47:32)
user eclipse underscore tt i'm not a (47:29 - 47:34)
hundred percent sure how accurate this (47:32 - 47:35)
is (47:34 - 47:38)
that's interesting though so take this (47:35 - 47:39)
with a grain of salt (47:38 - 47:42)
they're not a verified twitter they're (47:39 - 47:43)
from italy (47:42 - 47:45)
but they said pokemon earnings have (47:43 - 47:46)
leaked (47:45 - 47:49)
they have no source for this i'm not (47:46 - 47:51)
sure how trustworthy they are (47:49 - 47:54)
it seems it seems believable so and it's (47:51 - 47:55)
i don't think it's (47:54 - 47:57)
that harmful to cover here it just says (47:55 - 47:59)
uh the (47:57 - 48:03)
merchandise part of pokemon has made (47:59 - 48:06)
67 billion dollars the (48:03 - 48:09)
video game part has made 19 billion (48:06 - 48:10)
dollars (48:09 - 48:15)
the card game tcg has made 12 (48:10 - 48:18)
billion dollars the box office movies (48:15 - 48:20)

anime 863 million (48:23 - 48:30)
and the manga 72 (48:27 - 48:32)
million dollars how does the cartoon (48:30 - 48:33)
make money (48:32 - 48:36)
oh commercials commercials wait does (48:33 - 48:38)
that exist anymore (48:36 - 48:42)
uh i mean in canada it's on regular tv (48:38 - 48:44)
and i think on the uk it's on regular tv (48:42 - 48:47)
in the united states it's on netflix (48:44 - 48:49)
yeah i mean my world has become so (48:47 - 48:51)
distorted that literally (48:49 - 48:53)
i was i was talking about a very (48:51 - 48:54)
exciting product that i've been (48:53 - 48:56)
using recently that i'm super excited (48:54 - 48:58)
about and she's like oh i saw the tv (48:56 - 49:00)
commercial for that and (48:58 - 49:01)
did you see the tv commercial for that (49:00 - 49:03)
and i was like what's a tv commercial (49:01 - 49:06)
yeah i what i don't even get youtube (49:03 - 49:09)
commercials anymore (49:06 - 49:11)
i only i only occasionally see youtube (49:09 - 49:12)
commercials (49:11 - 49:17)
and the streaming service that we watch (49:12 - 49:20)
uh masterchef australia and other such (49:17 - 49:21)
foreign (49:20 - 49:24)
tv shows is has (49:21 - 49:26)
ads in it but that's the only time i (49:24 - 49:27)
ever see commercials anymore i don't (49:26 - 49:29)
even know when things are on anymore (49:27 - 49:31)
like i don't know when (49:29 - 49:34)
a new episode is supposed to drop i just (49:31 - 49:35)
wait for some to be (49:34 - 49:37)

about it i'm like oh i should go watch (49:37 - 49:39)
that (49:38 - 49:42)
i guess even if this uh tweet is not a (49:39 - 49:44)
hundred percent accurate it's what (49:42 - 49:45)
these numbers are very very close to (49:44 - 49:47)
what lines up on what was reported on (49:45 - 49:48)
wikipedia (49:47 - 49:50)
uh for their earnings which the (49:48 - 49:52)
wikipedia has like different sources of (49:50 - 49:53)
what (49:52 - 49:55)
report where where they're getting those (49:53 - 49:56)
reports from (49:55 - 49:59)
well and it all translates to the same (49:56 - 50:00)
thing no matter what the numbers are (49:59 - 50:03)
and it's that uh pokemon makes a heck (50:00 - 50:04)
ton of money (50:03 - 50:08)
oh yeah huge yeah specifically the (50:04 - 50:09)
merchandise (50:08 - 50:12)

okay this question is from steven uh (51:51 - 51:54)
before you became (51:53 - 51:56)
financially independent were there any (51:54 - 51:58)
pokemon related merchandises you wish (51:56 - 51:59)
your parents (51:58 - 52:00)
relatives friends would have gotten you (51:59 - 52:02)
unfortunately they didn't (52:00 - 52:04)
oh see this is a good question because (52:02 - 52:05)
you guys were already adults when (52:04 - 52:06)
pokemon was (52:05 - 52:08)
already financially independent and i (52:06 - 52:10)
did make a ton of pokemon purchases (52:08 - 52:12)
including pokemon box (52:10 - 52:14)
all for myself is there any merch you (52:12 - 52:15)
regret (52:14 - 52:18)
missing out on greg there are a few (52:15 - 52:22)
uh gba's that (52:18 - 52:24)
were pokemon related that i didn't i've (52:22 - 52:26)

a couple more and i really really like (52:27 - 52:31)
the torchic one i really wish i would (52:29 - 52:31)
have bought (52:31 - 52:33)
the other ones it's the only one i can (52:31 - 52:34)
think of that (52:33 - 52:36)
just the special editions of the (52:34 - 52:39)
consoles that i've come and gone (52:36 - 52:42)
that i didn't purchase some i couldn't (52:39 - 52:45)
like the was it the gold one that never (52:42 - 52:46)
came here the gold (52:45 - 52:48)
yes that would that's my answer right (52:46 - 52:49)
there (52:48 - 52:52)
that one yeah the gold 3ds (52:49 - 52:54)
the gold three it had like the beautiful (52:52 - 52:56)
evaltol art on it yeah (52:54 - 52:58)
i don't remember that one because it (52:56 - 53:00)
never came to the u.s it never came to (52:58 - 53:01)
the us (53:00 - 53:03)
we got the like the black 3ds and the (53:01 - 53:06)
blue 3ds (53:03 - 53:06)
there was a gold one that had a (53:06 - 53:10)
beautiful art on it (53:08 - 53:12)
that was beautiful and i wanted that one (53:10 - 53:14)
to come and it didn't come here (53:12 - 53:17)
i i wish that 230 on ebay right now (53:14 - 53:19)
yeah well that that game system has (53:17 - 53:20)
passed (53:19 - 53:23)
so into that i know i still play my 3ds (53:20 - 53:25)
every day (53:23 - 53:27)
no box though only console how about you (53:25 - 53:28)
steve (53:27 - 53:30)
i mean i will say i could go on about (53:28 - 53:31)
all the star wars stuff i wish my (53:30 - 53:32)
parents (53:31 - 53:33)
bought me when i was a kid that they (53:32 - 53:35)
never did uh (53:33 - 53:38)
i think consoles is a good one um i had (53:35 - 53:39)
a couple of the (53:38 - 53:42)
pokemon consoles that i no longer (53:39 - 53:44)
have because at one point i was very (53:42 - 53:46)
poor in my life (53:44 - 53:49)
and i needed to sell some stuff uh there (53:46 - 53:50)
are some (53:49 - 53:53)
cards i wish i never sold but i (53:50 - 53:56)
had like i had tropical beach which i (53:53 - 53:58)
think is a very expensive card now when (53:56 - 54:00)
i bought it it was a hundred and twenty (53:58 - 54:02)
dollars but i think uh (54:00 - 54:04)
i think it's like a four hundred dollar (54:02 - 54:06)
card now not that i would sell it just (54:04 - 54:08)
be cool to have in my collection again (54:06 - 54:10)
yeah i guess yeah there's there i mean (54:08 - 54:12)
there were lots of things my parents (54:10 - 54:13)
didn't buy me (54:12 - 54:15)
pokemon related that i would would have (54:13 - 54:17)
wanted (54:15 - 54:20)
but a lot of that stuff was probably (54:17 - 54:21)
just like (54:20 - 54:24)
cheap homey slash what other what other (54:21 - 54:28)
toy companies were there back in the day (54:24 - 54:28)
uh i can't remember who used to make (54:30 - 54:33)
toys before (54:31 - 54:35)
wicked cool toys took over but i wanted (54:33 - 54:37)
a lot of that stuff (54:35 - 54:40)
hasbro oh you mean pokemon stuff yeah (54:37 - 54:43)
oh yeah yeah i'm very very upset i never (54:40 - 54:44)
got pokemon box (54:43 - 54:46)
but also when pokemon box came out that (54:44 - 54:48)
was like the that was like the short (54:46 - 54:50)
period of time where pokemon was off my (54:48 - 54:50)
radar (54:50 - 54:54)
that would have been when i was (54:50 - 54:56)
middle school like late middle school (54:54 - 54:57)
yeah nothing (54:56 - 54:59)
super super stands out like if i if i (54:57 - 55:01)
was uh (54:59 - 55:04)
if i was swimming in like ninja or (55:01 - 55:05)
pokemane or (55:04 - 55:07)
shroud money you better believe i'd be (55:05 - 55:09)
going to ebay and i'd be buying all (55:07 - 55:10)
these (55:09 - 55:13)
pokemon consoles that i missed out on i (55:10 - 55:13)
will say (55:13 - 55:17)
the one thing that i wish existed (55:13 - 55:19)
and i think that some this is gonna (55:17 - 55:20)
sound so weird (55:19 - 55:21)
i don't know how to put it out the right (55:20 - 55:23)
way my mom has (55:21 - 55:27)
a hello kitty that is literally (55:23 - 55:31)
like all diamonds and precious gems (55:27 - 55:33)
it's like a little hello kitty pendant (55:31 - 55:34)
like if there was like (55:33 - 55:37)
really really nice not somewhat (55:34 - 55:39)
potentially offensive pokemon jewelry (55:37 - 55:41)
out there (55:39 - 55:43)
i'd probably go for that like a really (55:41 - 55:45)
high quality pokemon rolex (55:43 - 55:47)
that's that's what i'd be going for at (55:45 - 55:49)
this point in my life i mean it had the (55:47 - 55:50)
fossil (55:49 - 55:54)
10th anniversary uh pikachu watch i did (55:50 - 55:56)
buy that and i wore that (55:54 - 56:00)
for a very very long time before it died (55:56 - 56:02)
high enough quality i've made a lot of (56:00 - 56:04)
poor pokemon choices (56:02 - 56:06)
in my life greg you put that pokemon box (56:04 - 56:07)
up on ebay (56:06 - 56:10)
it's going for 810.41 bids (56:07 - 56:12)
why would i get away give away my (56:10 - 56:14)
precious pokemon box (56:12 - 56:17)
i will sell it on my death bed when it's (56:14 - 56:18)
worth (56:17 - 56:21)
five thousand blocks that's true you (56:18 - 56:22)
gotta let it appreciate a little bit (56:21 - 56:23)
more and (56:22 - 56:26)
yes exactly it's so funny because the (56:23 - 56:27)
japanese version of pokemon box is like (56:26 - 56:32)
50 bucks (56:27 - 56:34)
and i finally found it so you know i (56:32 - 56:36)
found my copy again (56:34 - 56:38)
well put it in your safe deposit box man (56:36 - 56:40)
don't don't let it get lost again (56:38 - 56:43)
yeah i know where it is now i i've i've (56:40 - 56:44)
put it in a safe spot (56:43 - 56:46)
you are like actually at this point (56:44 - 56:49)
better off buying a japanese gamecube (56:46 - 56:52)
buying a japanese copy pokemon box and (56:49 - 56:53)
then being done with it (56:52 - 56:54)
yeah i don't think there's like anything (56:53 - 56:57)
specific that i like super super regret (56:54 - 56:59)
not having because most of that stuff (56:57 - 57:00)
you can find it's just like more (56:59 - 57:01)
expensive (57:00 - 57:05)
or less less expensive i remember like (57:01 - 57:07)
as a kid the burger king gold (57:05 - 57:10)
coins cards like i wanted them (57:07 - 57:14)
so badly and the only reason i think my (57:10 - 57:15)
parents (57:14 - 57:17)
got them wasn't to satisfy me but (57:15 - 57:18)
because they (57:17 - 57:20)
they sincerely thought that they were (57:18 - 57:21)
going to be worth something in the (57:20 - 57:22)
future (57:21 - 57:23)
because that was around the time where (57:22 - 57:25)
everyone in the 90s thought everything (57:23 - 57:27)
was worth something (57:25 - 57:30)
like beanie babies and baseball cards (57:27 - 57:31)
and everything (57:30 - 57:33)
but now like if you were like man i (57:31 - 57:35)
really wish i had those burger king gold (57:33 - 57:36)
coins like (57:35 - 57:40)
they're they're like 50 bucks on ebay (57:36 - 57:43)
that's 50 bucks you don't have though (57:40 - 57:43)
it's true (57:43 - 57:47)
those those will be you know (57:43 - 57:50)
when the economy collapses and we are (57:47 - 57:52)
all trading in pokemon gold coins (57:50 - 57:54)
you'll wish that you had those like i (57:52 - 57:56)
did true very true (57:54 - 57:57)
you got to buy them now put them in your (57:56 - 57:59)
safe deposit box (57:57 - 58:02)
get your kids through college yep oh (57:59 - 58:03)
yeah that was back in the time where (58:02 - 58:04)
they really (58:03 - 58:06)
pushed poliwhirl real hard on things (58:04 - 58:07)
yeah they were really pushing by polly (58:06 - 58:08)
world (58:07 - 58:10)
they pushed pollyworld real hard for a (58:08 - 58:11)
long time (58:10 - 58:13)
yeah it didn't really work out for it (58:11 - 58:15)
yeah because then polly toad came along (58:13 - 58:16)
and there was like (58:15 - 58:19)
get out of here will pokemon of the week (58:16 - 58:19)
oh (58:19 - 58:22)
oh no you guys can't handle this all (58:19 - 58:22)
right (58:22 - 58:24)
last week's pokemon of the week supposed (58:22 - 58:26)
to be easy (58:24 - 58:29)
i think it was easy compared to (58:26 - 58:32)
pokemon evolution lines from kanto if (58:29 - 58:34)
you remember that place (58:32 - 58:37)
and uh one of the clues was that one of (58:34 - 58:39)
the evolution lines kind of does what (58:37 - 58:42)
happens in the real world one doesn't (58:39 - 58:43)
one (58:42 - 58:45)
changes its type combinations for its (58:43 - 58:47)
final evolution one doesn't (58:45 - 58:49)
one it gets a gigantomax one gets a mega (58:47 - 58:51)
evolution (58:49 - 58:53)
one's a version exclusive and that's the (58:51 - 58:55)
one that we were actually looking for (58:53 - 58:58)
and then i said which pokemon has 14 (58:55 - 59:00)
feet a party hat and a clown nose (58:58 - 59:03)
[Laughter] (59:00 - 59:07)
and shows up in pokemon go way too much (59:03 - 59:07)
it's (59:07 - 59:10)
gulpin gulpin doesn't show up in pokemon (59:11 - 59:14)
go at all (59:13 - 59:18)
okay you're good weedle weedle (59:14 - 59:22)
that's right women that's a super cute (59:18 - 59:25)
shuffle icon although i do (59:22 - 59:28)
feel that the shuffle icon skimped on (59:25 - 59:30)
the party hat too much (59:28 - 59:33)
hmm party hat oh you mean it's needle (59:30 - 59:36)
yeah are you telling me that (59:33 - 59:40)
bees don't come from poisonous bugs that (59:36 - 59:44)
go into a cocoon well wasps (59:40 - 59:48)
don't cocoon that's all i can say (59:44 - 59:50)
wasps do not cocoon ah is there any (59:48 - 59:52)
weedle trivia out there (59:50 - 59:54)
oh it's been around forever the original (59:52 - 59:56)
early drawing of weedle that's listed in (59:54 - 59:58)
bulbapedia (59:56 - 60:01)
is wild to me yeah it (59:58 - 60:04)
looks like from some child (60:01 - 60:07)
storybook it looks like a twinkie with a (60:04 - 60:08)
clown's head attached (60:07 - 60:10)
so pokemon platinum weedle was (60:08 - 60:12)
completely incapable of damaging (60:10 - 60:15)
steel-type pokemon outside struggle (60:12 - 60:16)
it could only learn poison sting which (60:15 - 60:18)
steel types were immune to (60:16 - 60:21)
from platinum onward weedle could learn (60:18 - 60:22)
bug bite (60:21 - 60:26)
what a useless piece of trivia and what (60:22 - 60:29)
explains the near extinction of weedle (60:26 - 60:30)
when steel types (60:29 - 60:34)
arrived uh then wheel evolved to (60:30 - 60:36)
finally be able to defend itself at what (60:34 - 60:39)
point in the game are you being like oh (60:36 - 60:40)
man i really (60:39 - 60:43)
my wheel hasn't evolved yet my starter's (60:40 - 60:44)
dead (60:43 - 60:47)
i'm facing a magnemite (60:44 - 60:49)
a lot of things would have to line up (60:47 - 60:51)
for this to happen i don't even know how (60:49 - 60:53)
early on you could even get wheedle and (60:51 - 60:54)
platinum (60:53 - 60:55)
i don't remember it being on one of the (60:54 - 60:57)
early routes because it was like (60:55 - 60:58)
remember (60:57 - 61:01)
yeah b doof and shanks are on early (60:58 - 61:02)
routes (61:01 - 61:05)
starly weedle is the only pokemon that (61:02 - 61:08)
cannot legitimately know any normal type (61:05 - 61:10)
moves (61:08 - 61:12)
that that's a good piece of trivia oh (61:10 - 61:13)
yeah no though (61:12 - 61:16)
i don't know what legitimate means (61:13 - 61:19)
can another can you not even breed it (61:16 - 61:20)
it's weird (61:19 - 61:23)
no tms no hms nothing like that no (61:20 - 61:25)
giovanni had a weedle in the manga it (61:23 - 61:27)
evolved into a bee drill (61:25 - 61:29)
well that's what they do that's the (61:27 - 61:32)
whole nature of the weed (61:29 - 61:34)
is that all you got that's all i got (61:32 - 61:36)
that's it okay not a lot i mean there is (61:34 - 61:37)
but it's all like in this (61:36 - 61:43)
section of the anime in episode 1042 (61:37 - 61:44)
all right here we go this is just a (61:43 - 61:46)
series of questions (61:44 - 61:48)
so be prepared to answer a bunch of (61:46 - 61:50)
questions (61:48 - 61:52)
did you know twitch plays pokemon is (61:50 - 61:53)
still a thing (61:52 - 61:56)
it still exists do you remember that (61:53 - 61:58)
certain people felt that omanite was an (61:56 - 62:00)
important pokemon because of the helix (61:58 - 62:02)
fossil fetishism (62:00 - 62:03)
do you think that they were wrong or (62:02 - 62:06)
right do you remember the other members (62:03 - 62:09)
of the twitch plays pokemon team (62:06 - 62:10)
do you think that there was an accident (62:09 - 62:12)
in the finalization of pokemon red and (62:10 - 62:14)
blue (62:12 - 62:16)
do you feel magikarp should evolve into (62:14 - 62:18)
dragonite and dragonair should evolve (62:16 - 62:19)
into gyarados (62:18 - 62:21)
have you seen similar patterns in other (62:19 - 62:23)
kanto pokemon (62:21 - 62:25)
have you looked into the eyes of one bug (62:23 - 62:28)
type pokemon and wondered why its eyes (62:25 - 62:29)
change when it evolves (62:28 - 62:31)
that its eyes change to look like a (62:29 - 62:34)
different pokemon (62:31 - 62:36)
do you remember the clues to last week's (62:34 - 62:37)
pokemon of the week (62:36 - 62:40)
if they referenced two different pokemon (62:37 - 62:40)
does (62:40 - 62:44)
this week's pokemon complete the triad (62:40 - 62:50)
there you go (62:44 - 62:50)

plays pokemon because it just celebrated (62:56 - 62:59)
like (62:58 - 63:02)

pokemon that all you had to do was like (63:20 - 63:24)
connect to the internet and get them (63:22 - 63:25)
i'm trying to remember if there were (63:24 - 63:27)
some because i went to almost all the (63:25 - 63:29)
mall events i'm trying to think if (63:27 - 63:30)
there's anything given out (63:29 - 63:32)
at those that i was able to get because (63:30 - 63:34)
i actually did the (63:32 - 63:36)
pokemon rocks america i took a train to (63:34 - 63:39)
chicago by myself (63:36 - 63:41)
and went to that event pokemon rocks (63:39 - 63:42)
