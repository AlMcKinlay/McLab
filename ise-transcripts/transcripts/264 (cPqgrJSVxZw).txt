pain right now (1:02 - 1:06)

you are a new listener to the Pokemon (1:16 - 1:21)
podcast welcome Pat was outstanding that (1:18 - 1:23)
interview was last week it should be (1:21 - 1:26)
somewhat in the middle of the show if (1:23 - 1:27)
you're just looking for that interview I (1:26 - 1:30)
would check the go check the description (1:27 - 1:32)
of the episode otherwise it will (1:30 - 1:34)
probably appear right after our new (1:32 - 1:36)
segment otherwise our show is pretty (1:34 - 1:37)
straightforward we got spoke my news we (1:36 - 1:39)

week just Mike and I holding it down but (1:43 - 1:47)
I think I think we'll be able to manage (1:46 - 1:51)
as the other hosts disappear I feel (1:47 - 1:53)
myself growing stronger good it's like (1:51 - 1:56)
it can consuming their power it's like (1:53 - 1:58)
that Jet Li movie one I was gonna say (1:56 - 2:00)
it's like persona 5 we just saw that (1:58 - 2:03)
take two personas and merge them into (2:00 - 2:07)
one or the way more relevant comparison (2:03 - 2:09)
what did Jet Li one I don't know that (2:07 - 2:12)
don't know persona is way more relevant (2:09 - 2:15)
than a Jet Li movie from like 2000 ok (2:12 - 2:17)
good good for some reason I went (2:15 - 2:20)
straight to 2000 movies though mm-hmm ok (2:17 - 2:23)
alright I'll just jump into Pokemon news (2:20 - 2:26)
I guess cuz maybe I maybe I'm not (2:23 - 2:30)
getting stronger as the other day it's (2:26 - 2:33)
back up everything worse (2:30 - 2:36)

feel like Pokemon go is come is making a (3:17 - 3:25)
heavy return yep sarcasm I don't get why (3:20 - 3:26)
they just didn't make that a week yeah (3:25 - 3:29)
why like why three days I don't I don't (3:26 - 3:31)
get it but it's cool that they keep (3:29 - 3:32)
doing stuff I just wish it was longer (3:31 - 3:35)
especially since like alright now it's (3:32 - 3:37)
back to normal for however long it was (3:35 - 3:39)
so understated to that like I but by the (3:37 - 3:41)
time I realized it was a thing it was (3:39 - 3:44)

Informer Game Informer get your powerup (4:30 - 4:34)
rewards get your deals on used games (4:32 - 4:37)
don't find new games before they don't (4:34 - 4:40)
pick out of that I don't know if you I (4:37 - 4:41)
don't want to get too off-topic because (4:40 - 4:44)
again my my mouth is killing me so I (4:41 - 4:46)
feel like the more I talk the more I (4:44 - 4:47)
just (4:46 - 4:50)
endure this pain but I do have a semi (4:47 - 4:52)
good GameStop story when I worked there (4:50 - 4:55)
for about six months which was probably (4:52 - 4:57)
like 12 hours over the six months (4:55 - 4:59)
because gamestop has the worst powers (4:57 - 5:02)
slash policy of how you work ever there (4:59 - 5:04)
were a lot of people that would get the (5:02 - 5:06)
get the magazine subscription for the (5:04 - 5:08)
discount card cuz don't aren't you if (5:06 - 5:10)
you're like a Gamestop member you get (5:08 - 5:12)
like ten percent off used games or (5:10 - 5:14)
something like that I believe that's the (5:12 - 5:16)
only way you get it is you pay like (5:14 - 5:18)
fifteen bucks or whatever it is yeah you (5:16 - 5:20)
get the card and the magazine yes you (5:18 - 5:22)
get twelve months of the magazine so it (5:20 - 5:24)
I mean if you shop at games up a lot and (5:22 - 5:26)
you only buy used games it does it does (5:24 - 5:28)
pay for itself but there were there (5:26 - 5:29)
would be a lot of customers that (5:28 - 5:31)
wouldn't want the magazine at all and (5:29 - 5:35)
and this was like 2006-2007 so Meg this (5:31 - 5:37)
was before this was kinda before like (5:35 - 5:39)
iPads and stuff this was when magazines (5:37 - 5:42)
were still pretty for elevant but one of (5:39 - 5:43)
the dudes that worked there anytime (5:42 - 5:45)
somebody said they didn't want the (5:43 - 5:48)
magazine the the GameStop system still (5:45 - 5:50)
required an address you still had to (5:48 - 5:52)
send the magazine somewhere so he would (5:50 - 5:55)
just put his own address in so every (5:52 - 5:58)
month he would get like 14 to 15 Game (5:55 - 6:02)
Informer's delivered to his house (5:58 - 6:05)
credible it sounds like the the the (6:02 - 6:07)
worst layer of him (6:05 - 6:12)
yeah the worst one just endless endless (6:07 - 6:14)
supply of Game Informer magazines every (6:12 - 6:16)
month I mean if you had a fireplace you (6:14 - 6:18)
really saving on your heating bill I (6:16 - 6:20)
would assume isn't that like with the (6:18 - 6:21)
ink and everything those that is (6:20 - 6:25)
probably really bad for the environment (6:21 - 6:27)
boy it's a report about feeling that I (6:25 - 6:29)
worked at Gamestop too and it's it's (6:27 - 6:33)
it's bad it's it's not good this is off (6:29 - 6:36)
polygon comp oh c'mon stars rumor fly (6:33 - 6:38)
after new merch seems to drop a hint (6:36 - 6:41)
the Japanese Pokemon Center is adding a (6:38 - 6:42)
new line of merchandise inspired by (6:41 - 6:44)
cosmic one of the starring legendary (6:42 - 6:46)
monsters in Pokemon Sun and Moon the (6:44 - 6:48)
look upon the Stars collection is a (6:46 - 6:50)
perfect fit for any starry-eyed Pokemon (6:48 - 6:52)
but many fans also see it as an obvious (6:50 - 6:55)
nod towards the rumor Pokemon Stars the (6:52 - 6:57)
3d s's follow-up game Pokemon stars (6:55 - 7:00)
first entered the lexicon in (6:57 - 7:02)
that that's a fancy word Lexington in (7:00 - 7:05)
November right around Sun and moons (7:02 - 7:08)
launch Eurogamer reported that a (7:05 - 7:11)
director's cut of the 3ds game by that (7:08 - 7:12)
name would be heading to the Nintendo (7:11 - 7:15)
switch sometime in 2017 we have neither (7:12 - 7:18)
seen nor heard anything more about the (7:15 - 7:20)
rumor projects since then but fans are (7:18 - 7:23)
taking the series of Pokemon inspired (7:20 - 7:26)
items by the stars as a tall tale sign (7:23 - 7:30)
as it does a joke yeah you're about a (7:26 - 7:32)
lot of star puns in this so far yeah I (7:30 - 7:34)
look forward to the rest of them I (7:32 - 7:36)
believe yeah allegra frank wrote that (7:34 - 7:37)
we've had her on the show she's (7:36 - 7:39)
fantastic eurogamer's Tom Phillips (7:37 - 7:42)
helped leak the spectacle charge lifting (7:39 - 7:44)
an eyebrow at I feel like Pokemon knows (7:42 - 7:45)
what they're doing (7:44 - 7:48)
oh absolutely I say that it's either (7:45 - 7:51)
it's definitely something that they're (7:48 - 7:53)
aware of and whether or not they're (7:51 - 7:55)
actually hinting at like ooh Pokemon (7:53 - 7:57)
stars is coming here's some hints in (7:55 - 8:00)
some wordplay or they're doing it (7:57 - 8:01)
because they know that everybody is (8:00 - 8:03)
expecting stars and it's not going to be (8:01 - 8:05)
stars and they're doing it just to mess (8:03 - 8:07)
with everyone I feel like either is is (8:05 - 8:10)
possible they've messed with us before (8:07 - 8:12)
right I feel like oh we have oh yeah (8:10 - 8:13)
they definitely have because they've (8:12 - 8:15)
showed like sylveon was messing with us (8:13 - 8:17)
that was a new type they purposely (8:15 - 8:19)
teased that without saying anything (8:17 - 8:21)
yeah they know what they're doing the (8:19 - 8:23)
worst company ever (8:21 - 8:28)
I would I would out Japan gets a lot of (8:23 - 8:31)
collections that we don't get so if the (8:28 - 8:34)
looking to the stars connection comes to (8:31 - 8:36)
the US Pokemon Center I would probably (8:34 - 8:39)
give that a little more weight yeah but (8:36 - 8:40)
I wish we'll see (8:39 - 8:42)
this really isn't news kind of hard to (8:40 - 8:43)
report on but I don't know if you saw it (8:42 - 8:47)
mica there was a video slash gift going (8:43 - 8:51)
around of uh uh Pikachu getting like (8:47 - 8:54)
mugged offstage did you see this oh no (8:51 - 8:58)
oh okay excuse me at the Pokemon world (8:54 - 9:01)
festival 2017 in South Korea which (8:58 - 9:03)
happened just a couple days ago there is (9:01 - 9:05)
uh there was a bunch of Pikachu's (9:03 - 9:09)
dancing as Pikachu's do in the in the (9:05 - 9:11)
Asian continents that we don't get (9:09 - 9:12)
blessed with here in the United States (9:11 - 9:14)
so there's a (9:12 - 9:18)
for probably 14 Pikachu's dancing and (9:14 - 9:20)
one of the Pikachu's in the front row (9:18 - 9:23)
starts deflating like its head begins to (9:20 - 9:26)
sink into each other and very quickly (9:23 - 9:31)
five people in what looks to be FBI / (9:26 - 9:33)
Secret Service suits come out and (9:31 - 9:36)
quickly drag the Pikachu away as the (9:33 - 9:39)
other 13 Pikachu continue to dance oh (9:36 - 9:42)
that was real there's no news there it's (9:39 - 9:45)
just that something that happened Japan (9:42 - 9:47)
is very on top of making sure that no (9:45 - 9:51)
one sees a deflating Pikachu yeah I mean (9:47 - 9:53)
III would guess it would be really (9:51 - 9:55)
horrifying for children yeah and also (9:53 - 9:57)
like to point out real quick that you (9:55 - 9:59)
you referred to them as the Asian (9:57 - 10:02)
comments I'm gonna give you pass though (9:59 - 10:06)
cuz you're sick the continent of Asia (10:02 - 10:09)
how's that all the continents of Asia (10:06 - 10:14)
yeah I resumed a drop in the ba it's (10:09 - 10:19)
okay I would assume it so that it it's (10:14 - 10:21)
it doesn't give any children nightmares (10:19 - 10:23)
I haven't seen the image but from the (10:21 - 10:25)
description it sounds like maybe also I (10:23 - 10:27)
mean I would assume it's like the same (10:25 - 10:29)
as like a fashion show right if if (10:27 - 10:32)
somebody falls you you address that (10:29 - 10:34)
situations as quickly as possible (10:32 - 10:37)
yeah yes and they're on top of their (10:34 - 10:38)
Pikachu (10:37 - 10:41)
the fact that they had not like one or (10:38 - 10:43)
two people quickly removed the Pikachu (10:41 - 10:46)
it was like five that's some dedication (10:43 - 10:49)
to the art the sounds hilarious this is (10:46 - 10:52)
from see like the voice creek this is (10:49 - 10:55)
from CNBC halo Pokemon Street Fighter (10:52 - 10:58)
added to the video game Hall of Fame (10:55 - 11:00)
well has a lot of emotions in one sense (10:58 - 11:03)
I didn't know where it was going (11:00 - 11:06)
let's get those three away let's talk (11:03 - 11:08)
about the most part one Donkey Kong (11:06 - 11:10)
welcome to the donkey kong cast finally (11:08 - 11:13)
the love of Pokemon Donkey Kong merged (11:10 - 11:16)
together in one news article Donkey Kong (11:13 - 11:19)
released in 1981 was one of the first (11:16 - 11:21)
games directed and designed by sure Goro (11:19 - 11:24)
Mita Miyamoto who went on creating (11:21 - 11:27)
several iconic video game games at (11:24 - 11:28)
Nintendo such a super mario bro (11:27 - 11:30)
and The Legend of Zelda Donkey Kong was (11:28 - 11:32)
an arcade machine featuring the (11:30 - 11:35)
character jump man as he attempted to (11:32 - 11:36)
rescue his girlfriend Pauline from (11:35 - 11:39)
Donkey Kong a large ape who threw (11:36 - 11:41)
barrels at player jump man began (11:39 - 11:43)
inspiration for Nintendo's iconic mascot (11:41 - 11:46)
Mario who has started 200 video games (11:43 - 11:48)
really alright I could imagine that (11:46 - 11:50)
without da key yeah like Mario and Sonic (11:48 - 11:51)
at the Olympic Games (11:50 - 11:54)
without Donkey Kong there would be no (11:51 - 11:56)
Super Mario Brothers a member of world (11:54 - 12:00)
video game Hall of Fame John Paul Dyson (11:56 - 12:03)
says but Donkey Kong is much more than (12:00 - 12:05)
one character it's an overarching (12:03 - 12:07)
narrative of love and it's vibrant (12:05 - 12:09)
graphics brought a game to life that few (12:07 - 12:11)
others could in the early 1980s it (12:09 - 12:14)
captures the hearts of a generation none (12:11 - 12:16)
rest in peace hashtag donkey kong (12:14 - 12:19)
channel was well lived in our slack (12:16 - 12:22)

debacle there it is which which happened (12:38 - 12:44)
before and/or after the Mayo War but (12:41 - 12:48)
only recently active slack members will (12:44 - 12:51)
remember the donkey kong channel which (12:48 - 12:53)
is one of the happiest moments of my (12:51 - 12:54)
life (12:53 - 12:58)
it was incredible I vote that it comes (12:54 - 13:01)
back at the first sign of a new Donkey (12:58 - 13:03)
Kong game I agree with that the other (13:01 - 13:05)
news here pokemon red and green the (13:03 - 13:07)
original games first released in Japan (13:05 - 13:10)
in 1996 and later released as Pokemon (13:07 - 13:13)
Red and Blue in North America Europe (13:10 - 13:15)
Australia became a cultural phenomenon (13:13 - 13:17)
as well as several games the Pokemon (13:15 - 13:19)
franchise includes toys a trading card (13:17 - 13:22)
game a long-running television series in (13:19 - 13:25)
several films the game required players (13:22 - 13:27)
to capture train fight monsters with a (13:25 - 13:30)
main objective of collecting 151 unique (13:27 - 13:33)
Pokemon a clever element to the game was (13:30 - 13:35)
that a certain monster certain monsters (13:33 - 13:37)
were exclusive to one version of the (13:35 - 13:37)
game (13:37 - 13:39)
meaning players had to meet in real life (13:37 - 13:42)
to trade their monsters with another (13:39 - 13:44)
or on both versions of a game this (13:42 - 13:47)
continued relevance and popularity of (13:44 - 13:49)
the brand was viable last year with the (13:47 - 13:52)
Pokemon go crazy where players would use (13:49 - 13:53)
their phones to walk around real-life (13:52 - 13:55)
locations in order to find and capture (13:53 - 14:00)
monsters but uh yeah so CNBC a bunch of (13:55 - 14:02)
other sites reported on these games (14:00 - 14:04)

Space Invaders Super Mario Bros Tetris (14:21 - 14:26)
and World of Warcraft all of those (14:24 - 14:28)
before Donkey Kong is depressing yeah (14:26 - 14:32)
that's a real shame the fact that Sonic (14:28 - 14:36)
made it in before halos well at least (14:32 - 14:38)

guy in the show yeah he's no Pat Baer I (15:19 - 15:25)
gotta tell Tom that he's been hosting a (15:22 - 15:27)
pop Pokemon podcast called it's super (15:25 - 15:29)
effective from the brew city for seven (15:27 - 15:30)
years (15:29 - 15:32)
quote honestly I thought it would be big (15:30 - 15:34)
but I didn't think it would be as big as (15:32 - 15:37)
it became unquote said black jr. I can't (15:34 - 15:39)
wait to so that guy changes his last (15:37 - 15:40)
name (15:39 - 15:43)
it was huge dick the CEO of Nittany (15:40 - 15:45)
antic the developer of Pokemon go said (15:43 - 15:47)
in a speech on February that the game (15:45 - 15:50)
has been downloaded 650 million times it (15:47 - 15:52)
crushed Apple Store records in the first (15:50 - 15:53)
weeks (15:52 - 15:55)
Milwaukee's Lake Park was a primo spot (15:53 - 15:56)
for (15:55 - 15:57)
players that played last summer and fall (15:56 - 16:00)
and it kind of went on there's a video (15:57 - 16:03)
Go Go with it but might you've been to (16:00 - 16:04)
Lake Park we've talked about Lake Park (16:03 - 16:06)
in the past it's oh absolutely (16:04 - 16:10)
still exist can I just I everybody (16:06 - 16:11)
should watch that video because it has (16:10 - 16:13)
one of not because there's someone that (16:11 - 16:16)
we know in it but because it has my (16:13 - 16:18)
favorite Pokemon go Pont of all time (16:16 - 16:22)
when the reporter says will Pokemon stay (16:18 - 16:27)
or will Pokemon go and I lost it and I (16:22 - 16:29)
have a screenshot of the graphic that (16:27 - 16:30)
they made for that and I've been (16:29 - 16:33)
circulating it because I think it's (16:30 - 16:35)
hilarious it was funny cuz so that (16:33 - 16:37)
reporter uh we probably talked for like (16:35 - 16:39)
30 minutes and they ended up using (16:37 - 16:43)
twenty seconds of my audio which that's (16:39 - 16:46)
like classic news reporting right but (16:43 - 16:48)
apparently he said if like the spot got (16:46 - 16:51)
traction on TV they'd cut into a longer (16:48 - 16:53)
segment I don't know either Pokemon go (16:51 - 16:56)
is still a hot topic in Milwaukee or or (16:53 - 16:58)
News has been that slow that they had to (16:56 - 17:02)
come out and find me to report on (16:58 - 17:04)
something but I think it makes sense (17:02 - 17:06)
right now because of its on the cusp of (17:04 - 17:09)
summer games becoming it's the things (17:06 - 17:10)
that were popular last summer becoming (17:09 - 17:12)
relevant again as we get closer to (17:10 - 17:14)
summer yeah I guess that makes sense (17:12 - 17:17)
probably like the same same thing if if (17:14 - 17:19)
its nearing Christmas what toys are you (17:17 - 17:21)
gonna report on so like park I don't (17:19 - 17:23)
know if we talked about this life last (17:21 - 17:24)
week but when I was there (17:23 - 17:27)
there's the waterfall area which we (17:24 - 17:29)
talked about before the big thing there (17:27 - 17:31)
was there was three spots you people (17:29 - 17:33)
would just sit by the waterfall get all (17:31 - 17:35)
three put their lers down and then the (17:33 - 17:38)
the big debunk debunk ille de bazan de (17:35 - 17:41)
bungles the big dip uncle was that (17:38 - 17:42)
removed one of the spots so when I was (17:41 - 17:46)
there with the CBS people the spot was (17:42 - 17:48)
back and so we talked we talked about (17:46 - 17:50)
how like the polka stops now close at (17:48 - 17:53)
like 9 or 10 p.m. it would be really (17:50 - 17:57)
great if Niantic was just slowly adding (17:53 - 18:00)
just returning them and assuming that (17:57 - 18:01)
like (18:00 - 18:04)
the old out-of-touch people who were in (18:01 - 18:07)
charge of passing that law to get them (18:04 - 18:09)
removed in the first place just assuming (18:07 - 18:10)
that they're not paying attention and (18:09 - 18:12)
they're not so they're just returning (18:10 - 18:16)
them one by one I'm assuming that's not (18:12 - 18:19)
the case but well I mean like what if (18:16 - 18:21)
they did remove them back I don't think (18:19 - 18:23)
it's possible for a Pokemon go to be as (18:21 - 18:25)
big as it was last year so I don't know (18:23 - 18:27)
if they would actually notice yeah (18:25 - 18:30)
that's true I'm sure there's some cranky (18:27 - 18:34)
old dude who's like walking through the (18:30 - 18:36)
park once a week going well how many (18:34 - 18:39)
stops are here got to make sure I'm sure (18:36 - 18:41)
there's not if there's somebody (18:39 - 18:43)
Milwaukee that cares that much I would (18:41 - 18:45)
be I would want to interview that person (18:43 - 18:49)
I have very little patience for anything (18:45 - 18:51)
anybody that was involved in that at all (18:49 - 18:54)
I just want to say before you move on I (18:51 - 18:56)
will say I listened to last week's (18:54 - 18:59)
episode and I do agree with you that (18:56 - 19:02)
when it's closed it should be closed (18:59 - 19:04)
like I think that should apply to all (19:02 - 19:07)
parks if you're enforcing that the park (19:04 - 19:09)
is closed you you can't you can't (19:07 - 19:11)
complain about that you can't you can't (19:09 - 19:13)
be upset that you can't be in the park (19:11 - 19:15)
past the time that the park is supposed (19:13 - 19:18)
to be closed to play pokemon go because (19:15 - 19:21)
it's the law just don't do that I don't (19:18 - 19:23)
have my tax dollars paying for a police (19:21 - 19:26)
officer to yell at 21 year olds go home (19:23 - 19:28)
when I think it's a perfect example of (19:26 - 19:32)
like it makes it worse for everybody (19:28 - 19:35)
else when there's a group that's MIT (19:32 - 19:37)
that's just blatantly ignoring the law (19:35 - 19:40)
in that regard and I think that was part (19:37 - 19:45)
of why it got so much heat here maybe I (19:40 - 19:47)
can think it was a dumb response (19:45 - 19:49)
couldn't completely to remove it but I (19:47 - 19:52)
also think that it it was a it made (19:49 - 19:54)
sense that it went in that direction or (19:52 - 19:57)
that it got that much attention because (19:54 - 19:58)
there was so much like blatantly (19:57 - 20:01)
ignoring the law at Lake Park yeah we go (19:58 - 20:04)
on but we'll wait for more like Park (20:01 - 20:05)
nice because I'm sure there will be as (20:04 - 20:07)
I'm sure there will be summer approaches (20:05 - 20:12)

curious to see if if the tapu's are (21:46 - 21:52)
gonna be like I didn't I haven't looked (21:50 - 21:54)
at the cards but if they're gonna like (21:52 - 21:57)
dominate competitive the way they have (21:54 - 21:59)
in the games I'm sure one or two well (21:57 - 22:02)
I'm out of the loop right now but it's (21:59 - 22:05)
pretty much they make they make one of (22:02 - 22:07)
those featured Legendary's really really (22:05 - 22:10)
good weather I don't know but there are (22:07 - 22:11)
always cards that there are always (22:10 - 22:13)
Pokemon that they always make good like (22:11 - 22:16)
dark cry is always good Mewtwo is always (22:13 - 22:20)
good Mew is almost always good usually (22:16 - 22:22)
like the Charizard line or the squirtle (22:20 - 22:24)
line I know I said Charizard and (22:22 - 22:26)
squirtle those are the defining Pokemon (22:24 - 22:29)
in his line those line the ones on the (22:26 - 22:29)
box (22:29 - 22:32)

they're Pokemon that that they really (22:41 - 22:46)

curious if there are any returners where (22:46 - 22:51)

said you were a comedian so is that I (24:50 - 24:53)
want to know a little bit just about you (24:51 - 24:56)
outside of of packs and everything is (24:53 - 24:58)
that your your full-time job is that (24:56 - 25:00)
just the thing you do on the side I know (24:58 - 25:03)
yeah well so my full-time job is I work (25:00 - 25:05)
at I work in perform at The Upright (25:03 - 25:07)
Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York (25:05 - 25:10)
I've been performing here for 16 years (25:07 - 25:15)
and working here for 15 I started in the (25:10 - 25:19)
intern program became a tech person and (25:15 - 25:21)
now I'm the head tech of both of our New (25:19 - 25:23)
York venues and I my day-to-day is of (25:21 - 25:24)
being in charge of all the other tech (25:23 - 25:26)
people and then at night I am running (25:24 - 25:29)
lights and sound for shows and that's (25:26 - 25:32)
kind of my day job and then I auditioned (25:29 - 25:32)
for things (25:32 - 25:35)
look for me in Episode one of season (25:32 - 25:38)
three of difficult people that's coming (25:35 - 25:41)
out in on Hulu this year I do a little (25:38 - 25:43)
bit acting not a lot but a little bit (25:41 - 25:46)
and then I do comedy shows at night when (25:43 - 25:49)
I'm not protecting one of the shows that (25:46 - 25:51)
I used to do at UCB is actually the show (25:49 - 25:54)
that I do at pax called form foring it (25:51 - 25:58)
is a comedy panel show that looks at the (25:54 - 25:59)
best parts of the Internet and that's a (25:58 - 26:01)
show that I developed to be done onstage (25:59 - 26:05)
at UCB and then realized oh this is a (26:01 - 26:07)
show that works for anybody I could do (26:05 - 26:09)
this anywhere and pax felt like a good (26:07 - 26:12)
fit for that Pat I've been a a fan of (26:09 - 26:14)
yours for a long time I actually (26:12 - 26:17)
discovered you at PAX yeah mostly (26:14 - 26:19)
through the Giant Bomb guys since you (26:17 - 26:23)
seem to have them incorporated with your (26:19 - 26:26)
stuff yeah I'm a comedian in New York (26:23 - 26:28)
because I work at The Upright Citizens (26:26 - 26:30)
Brigade theater I've been able to kind (26:28 - 26:32)
of mash my comedy life with my video (26:30 - 26:35)
game love life like I'm just a fan of (26:32 - 26:36)
video games (26:35 - 26:38)
and also a fan of people that talk about (26:36 - 26:40)
them and so I became friends with a lot (26:38 - 26:43)
of the Harmonix social media people (26:40 - 26:45)
because they would come to New York and (26:43 - 26:48)
they would come see shows and then I had (26:45 - 26:49)
become friends with some of the Giant (26:48 - 26:52)
Bomb folks and when it came time to (26:49 - 26:54)
start doing panels at PAX it was a (26:52 - 26:57)
natural thing to be like oh well let me (26:54 - 26:59)
invite Ryan Davis to be on my panel (26:57 - 27:02)
because he's very funny and also he has (26:59 - 27:03)
a lot of Twitter followers so people (27:02 - 27:05)
will come to my panel if he tweets about (27:03 - 27:08)
it and then when it was time for legal (27:05 - 27:10)
fields which is what the bear cave (27:08 - 27:13)
references arrant rights and Eric Pope (27:10 - 27:16)
of formerly of Harmonix had decided they (27:13 - 27:18)
were going to do this big wrestling (27:16 - 27:21)
video game panel and I'm a huge (27:18 - 27:24)
wrestling fan and also a performer and (27:21 - 27:26)
someone that's good at producing things (27:24 - 27:28)
so I volunteered to kind of help out (27:26 - 27:31)
with that and now Aaron Aaron still does (27:28 - 27:34)
the brunt of the work but I'm definitely (27:31 - 27:36)
there to help him 2 to 3 times a year (27:34 - 27:40)
with what is up too much work for a (27:36 - 27:44)
panel and it's I appreciate cuz here's (27:40 - 27:45)
the thing so people didn't urban impacts (27:44 - 27:46)
but they've been to conventions they (27:45 - 27:48)
know there's a couple different kinds of (27:46 - 27:51)
panels right there's a informative (27:48 - 27:54)
panels on a very important topic that (27:51 - 27:55)
people are really interested in getting (27:54 - 27:57)
to like how to get into games industry (27:55 - 27:59)
where are we headed and stuff like that (27:57 - 28:01)
or how to speak to this kind of (27:59 - 28:04)
character how to make an RPG and then (28:01 - 28:06)
there's also like here's some people (28:04 - 28:08)
doing a thing we make fun of this thing (28:06 - 28:11)
but no one does it on the scale of (28:08 - 28:13)
league of heals the idea of getting (28:11 - 28:15)
upwards of 30 people together to play an (28:13 - 28:19)
old old video game and have personas and (28:15 - 28:22)
costumes and characters and a (28:19 - 28:25)
five-person camera crew and livestreams (28:22 - 28:28)
and it's just it's really excessive but (28:25 - 28:31)
uh still some people's favorite thing at (28:28 - 28:33)
PAX and that makes me very happy to hear (28:31 - 28:35)
that's awesome I do want to get to that (28:33 - 28:38)
a little bit more yes but let let's back (28:35 - 28:39)
up let's back up a bit (28:38 - 28:41)
this come on podcast right so we should (28:39 - 28:44)
probably talk about Pokemon how did you (28:41 - 28:47)
get into Pokemon where was the discovery (28:44 - 28:49)
of the franchise for you after (28:47 - 28:52)
me it started with the you know cartoon (28:49 - 28:55)
I've been a gamer for a long time but I (28:52 - 28:57)
was never really a portable gamer I was (28:55 - 28:59)
more of a console at home gamer so I I (28:57 - 29:02)
never had an original Gameboy uh I think (28:59 - 29:05)
my first game boy was a gameboy advance (29:02 - 29:07)
so I yeah I never had a gameboy or game (29:05 - 29:10)
break color it just never appealed to me (29:07 - 29:12)
oh yeah I had consoles on a TV so I (29:10 - 29:15)
always just played that so I would get (29:12 - 29:17)
like occasionally I would rent like a (29:15 - 29:19)
Pokemon game that was for the home (29:17 - 29:21)
system that I didn't quite understand (29:19 - 29:24)
like I remember the GameCube games were (29:21 - 29:26)
really weird in a way that I liked yeah (29:24 - 29:30)
but like their Pokemon I don't know (29:26 - 29:32)
there was like dark evil versions of (29:30 - 29:33)
Pokemon or something (29:32 - 29:35)
I think that was Gale of Darkness was (29:33 - 29:37)
the GameCube game yeah there was and I (29:35 - 29:39)
remember liking that but my friends were (29:37 - 29:41)
really into it so when I had a Game Boy (29:39 - 29:44)
Advance I got in one a Pokemon game (29:41 - 29:46)
would come out I mean it maybe it was (29:44 - 29:50)
crystal or emerald somebody somebody (29:46 - 29:52)
gemstones in the Pokemon world yeah both (29:50 - 29:55)
games yeah I all I know is it was it was (29:52 - 29:57)
the third and you know the the like they (29:55 - 29:59)
put out the two and then there was like (29:57 - 30:00)
the third one that comes out and it (29:59 - 30:02)
comes out kind of late and yeah (30:00 - 30:04)
combination of the two games I got one (30:02 - 30:06)
of those I'm just kind of on a whim and (30:04 - 30:09)
then I realized oh this is an RPG that (30:06 - 30:13)
system that I really I I like and again (30:09 - 30:16)
so I was like familiar with the Pokemon (30:13 - 30:19)
cartoon and knew about like the (30:16 - 30:21)
different kinds of Pokemon so when it (30:19 - 30:23)
when I realized like oh I actually like (30:21 - 30:26)
this kind of RPG then I kind of got (30:23 - 30:27)
really obsessed with it did that (30:26 - 30:30)
continue whichever series it was crystal (30:27 - 30:33)
emerald did you then continue getting (30:30 - 30:35)
them as it went on I have gotten a (30:33 - 30:39)
Pokemon games ever since uh yeah and so (30:35 - 30:40)
so be one of the things words like Oh (30:39 - 30:42)
new Pokemon is coming out time to (30:40 - 30:44)
upgrade my system I have to get a GS (30:42 - 30:45)
because there's a new Pokemon game (30:44 - 30:48)
coming out or I have to get a 3ds (30:45 - 30:50)
because there's a new Pokemon game and I (30:48 - 30:52)
haven't gotten that yet um I'll do (30:50 - 30:54)
everything I can in the game that that's (30:52 - 30:56)
my main thing is that like I'm a (30:54 - 30:59)
completionist so I still haven't (30:56 - 31:00)
finished my pokedex for son but I have (30:59 - 31:03)
like a lot of Pokemon (31:00 - 31:05)
and I'm like trading with people for (31:03 - 31:08)
moon and I I'm getting ready to do my (31:05 - 31:10)
trades just a trade back so that they (31:08 - 31:12)
will I'll get some evolutions out of (31:10 - 31:15)
trades and I just like that like oh I'm (31:12 - 31:18)
getting a lot I'm leveling up and and (31:15 - 31:20)
power leveling to power evolve some (31:18 - 31:24)
Pokemon and like I kind of get into that (31:20 - 31:27)
like because I don't love battle tree I (31:24 - 31:30)
don't really love like that kind of game (31:27 - 31:33)
plus yes I should describe my day so my (31:30 - 31:38)
day has a chunk of it dedicated to (31:33 - 31:41)
Pokemon which is a weird thing to say (31:38 - 31:43)
but I think once I explain it your (31:41 - 31:45)
listeners and you'll see you'll (31:43 - 31:46)
understand what I'm talking about (31:45 - 31:49)
um sure sure so I live in New York City (31:46 - 31:51)
and I have a commute that involves both (31:49 - 31:53)
walking and the subway (31:51 - 31:55)
so I walk for a couple minutes get on (31:53 - 31:58)
the subway ride that for like 10 to 15 (31:55 - 32:00)
minutes and then I walk for about 15 to (31:58 - 32:03)
20 minutes to my job and that's a 5 days (32:00 - 32:05)
a week I do that the subway ride is (32:03 - 32:08)
Pokemon Sun is out and I'm on an island (32:05 - 32:13)
you know with my level 97 Pokemon just (32:08 - 32:15)
beating Pokemon up and then my party is (32:13 - 32:17)
just all Pokemon that are like level 3 (32:15 - 32:19)
to whatever and I'm trying to level them (32:17 - 32:21)
up because I gotta get vanillish so I (32:19 - 32:24)
got a power level it that way and that's (32:21 - 32:25)
that and then when I get off the subway (32:24 - 32:28)
and then it's a 15 to 20 minute walk to (32:25 - 32:31)
work so then I open up Pokemon go and (32:28 - 32:33)
the nice thing about living in New York (32:31 - 32:35)
is there are a lot of polka stops (32:33 - 32:37)
because it's a very populated city yep (32:35 - 32:40)
on my walk from 14th Street to 3rd (32:37 - 32:44)
Street along Avenue a I'm collecting all (32:40 - 32:46)
kinds of stuff I'm getting Pokemon I'm (32:44 - 32:48)
all my eggs are getting closer to (32:46 - 32:51)
hatching I'll collect a few things and (32:48 - 32:54)
my buddies walk in so I'm getting some (32:51 - 32:58)
some candy that way and then I go to (32:54 - 33:00)
work and then I finish work and then (32:58 - 33:02)
I'll do basically the same thing and (33:00 - 33:04)
reverse on the way back you've got a (33:02 - 33:06)
system so it's a system it's a time (33:04 - 33:08)
killer and then I still I'll still like (33:06 - 33:10)
crack open like while I'm not killing (33:08 - 33:13)
time somewhere I'll crack open my 3s and (33:10 - 33:16)
like I don't know do some wonder trading (33:13 - 33:16)
or (33:16 - 33:19)
go to the pail ago and and you know see (33:16 - 33:20)
if there's any Pokemon they want to come (33:19 - 33:22)
be my friends so I can trade them away (33:20 - 33:25)
or whatever or like I've got a little (33:22 - 33:28)
time let me open up Pokemon go and and (33:25 - 33:31)
evolve some Pokemon and let me see what (33:28 - 33:33)
candies I need and should I switch out (33:31 - 33:35)
my buddy but like polka instead of like (33:33 - 33:37)
listening to audiobooks Pokemon is kind (33:35 - 33:40)
of like my commute activity totally that (33:37 - 33:43)
totally makes sense if I if I was to (33:40 - 33:45)
take public transportation that would (33:43 - 33:47)
probably be able to fit more Pokemon in (33:45 - 33:50)
my life but my commute is thirty two (33:47 - 33:53)
minute car ride that yeah I'm driving to (33:50 - 33:55)
and from work so it doesn't really work (33:53 - 33:57)
like that doesn't work like that no yeah (33:55 - 33:59)
so it's beneficial for me it's a thing (33:57 - 34:00)
we're like Pokemon go when it first came (33:59 - 34:02)
out I was like going to neighborhoods I (34:00 - 34:04)
don't normally go to because you'd be (34:02 - 34:07)
like well I hear their charm Anders over (34:04 - 34:08)
there and for whatever reason there's (34:07 - 34:12)
very few Charmander in a fire pokemon (34:08 - 34:15)
are kind of not in New York so it was (34:12 - 34:17)
like okay I got to go there and now it's (34:15 - 34:19)
just like well I'm walking in a park let (34:17 - 34:21)
me take out my phone turn on Pokemon go (34:19 - 34:24)
put in my pocket like I I'm not obsessed (34:21 - 34:27)
with can't catching them all but I'm uh (34:24 - 34:30)
I still would like to sure like I still (34:27 - 34:33)
don't have like all the dragon Pokemon (34:30 - 34:35)
and I don't have like you know there's a (34:33 - 34:37)
bunch of the evolved starters in this (34:35 - 34:39)
kid you know they released more Pokemon (34:37 - 34:41)
as you know I haven't gotten all of them (34:39 - 34:43)
but like I still like doing it it's (34:41 - 34:47)
still like gamifying walking and working (34:43 - 34:47)
out a little bit (34:47 - 34:50)
yeah which which I like I'm into I like (34:47 - 34:52)
that for somebody who who does both (34:50 - 34:55)
Pokemon go and the main series games and (34:52 - 34:57)
I feel like they've been out long enough (34:55 - 34:59)
where some people just kind of gravitate (34:57 - 35:02)
towards one is is there one that you (34:59 - 35:08)
prefer or are so I think that they they (35:02 - 35:09)
serve different purposes and they hit (35:08 - 35:12)
different parts of my brain Pokemon go (35:09 - 35:15)
is I would call Pokemon go a card (35:12 - 35:17)
collecting game more than a Pokemon game (35:15 - 35:20)
right it's just a themed Pokemon game (35:17 - 35:22)
our themed game that happens the theme (35:20 - 35:24)
is collect Pokemon but it could be (35:22 - 35:26)
almost anything like the game that it's (35:24 - 35:27)
based on which I can't remember the name (35:26 - 35:30)
of but it was a Google angrist and (35:27 - 35:32)
so yeah ingress didn't appeal to me (35:30 - 35:33)
because I don't care about taking over (35:32 - 35:36)
bases in a cyberpunk future (35:33 - 35:39)
like that's not a genre that I'm super (35:36 - 35:41)
into and I'm people are and that's (35:39 - 35:42)
awesome so I know a lot of people were (35:41 - 35:44)
really into ingress who aren't into (35:42 - 35:46)
Pokemon go but for me the idea of like (35:44 - 35:48)
there's a Pokemon gym right near my work (35:46 - 35:52)
and they're a friend of mine a co-worker (35:48 - 35:54)
still plays and so and once awhile will (35:52 - 35:56)
be like okay there it's at level seven (35:54 - 35:58)
let's let's take over that gym oh we can (35:56 - 36:00)
do it and like that's appealing to me as (35:58 - 36:03)
a Pokemon fan for for many years like (36:00 - 36:05)
walking around in the city and being (36:03 - 36:07)
like oh oh cool (36:05 - 36:11)
oh there's oh oh wow uh yeah I just got (36:07 - 36:14)
a sand slash awesome like that's fun for (36:11 - 36:16)
me in that but it's not obviously it's (36:14 - 36:19)
not a Pokemon Pokemon game you know and (36:16 - 36:23)
son one of the reasons I really like son (36:19 - 36:25)
is because it's trying to be a different (36:23 - 36:28)
Pokemon game it's not I'm sure this is (36:25 - 36:29)
well-worn territory but like they (36:28 - 36:31)
changed it up yeah they made it (36:29 - 36:34)
different you know you're you're you're (36:31 - 36:36)
sort of fighting an evil corporation but (36:34 - 36:39)
it's not a team skull isn't your like (36:36 - 36:42)
main enemy they're just they're kind of (36:39 - 36:45)
like yeah the idea of of beating that (36:42 - 36:47)
you know the this like instead of gems (36:45 - 36:49)
having it be like islands and challenges (36:47 - 36:52)
and and having to do memorization and I (36:49 - 36:54)
don't know I think the characters are (36:52 - 36:57)
more fun and the stories are interesting (36:54 - 37:00)
the idea of the idea of changing Pokemon (36:57 - 37:03)
types you know like oh you see a Persian (37:00 - 37:06)
you know what a Persian is oh nope not (37:03 - 37:08)
in this game you have to remember it you (37:06 - 37:09)
know it's a different type of Pokemon (37:08 - 37:11)
than it was in last one (37:09 - 37:13)
oh no that science slash is an ice type (37:11 - 37:16)
now it's not a ground type and like it's (37:13 - 37:18)
nothing major it doesn't really change (37:16 - 37:21)
the game but it it felt like somebody (37:18 - 37:26)
was like oh we we could just do x2 and (37:21 - 37:30)
y2 or we could do you know white and (37:26 - 37:32)
black or whatever like but what if we (37:30 - 37:34)
tried to make something a little (37:32 - 37:36)
different I like that a lot I do enjoy (37:34 - 37:38)
it so I guess I guess to answer your (37:36 - 37:42)
question I do lean more towards Sun and (37:38 - 37:44)
Moon and more traditional Pokemon games (37:42 - 37:47)
but I'm not opposed to a Pokemon game (37:44 - 37:50)
that's branded that like Pokemon go not (37:47 - 37:52)
you know I still like it I'm at yeah I'm (37:50 - 37:54)
in the same boat I like me both I I just (37:52 - 37:56)
stopped playing Pokemon shuffle which is (37:54 - 37:58)
just a match three game with Pokemon (37:56 - 38:00)
yeah but shuffle so good to shuffle is (37:58 - 38:02)
really good because it's a match three (38:00 - 38:04)
game with Pokemon you know I don't I (38:02 - 38:08)
don't play a lot of the the the dungeon (38:04 - 38:10)
games uh the puzzle dungeon kind of (38:08 - 38:12)
games because like I don't really enjoy (38:10 - 38:16)
that genre um but head Pokemon like (38:12 - 38:18)
pokemon mystery dungeon I bought because (38:16 - 38:20)
I was like well this is kind of it's (38:18 - 38:22)
kind of fun to walk around with a bunch (38:20 - 38:24)
of Pokemon and like do a different type (38:22 - 38:26)
of battling you know it's that it's like (38:24 - 38:28)
that come that that world provides sort (38:26 - 38:31)
of comfort whereas like ingress could (38:28 - 38:35)
fill the void of Pokemon go but like you (38:31 - 38:37)
said you you have no connection to a (38:35 - 38:39)
cyberpunk future yeah I don't I to me (38:37 - 38:41)
it's like Oh taking over a gym that (38:39 - 38:42)
sounds great (38:41 - 38:45)
taking over this deli because that's (38:42 - 38:47)
really all it is is it just oh this is a (38:45 - 38:49)
deli no this is the deli as a Pokemon (38:47 - 38:51)
gym this is a Starbucks where you can (38:49 - 38:54)
get Pokemon poke balls I'm like yep (38:51 - 38:57)
totally into that it's just it it's a (38:54 - 38:59)
little bit of a layer that is familiar (38:57 - 39:01)
uh in the same way that like for some (38:59 - 39:04)
people like they would never touch a (39:01 - 39:07)
Dynasty Warriors game but it's a dynasty (39:04 - 39:10)
Warriors game with Zelda okay and people (39:07 - 39:12)
will buy that because they love Zelda (39:10 - 39:14)
and they're like I can be linked and (39:12 - 39:16)
beat up a bunch of like a tire screen (39:14 - 39:20)
full of dudes okay I'm into it to touch (39:16 - 39:23)
on Pokemon go just because I haven't (39:20 - 39:24)
been I haven't been to New York in the (39:23 - 39:25)
past year or so (39:24 - 39:28)
or do you see other people playing (39:25 - 39:30)
Pokemon go on the street is it still a (39:28 - 39:32)
thing there if you go to parks you're (39:30 - 39:34)
still going to see people playing (39:32 - 39:35)
Pokemon it's not as big as it was (39:34 - 39:39)
obviously when the gen 2 Pokemon came (39:35 - 39:42)
out there was definitely a bump I live (39:39 - 39:45)
near Park in Brooklyn called McCarren (39:42 - 39:48)
Park and there's a baseball fields and (39:45 - 39:50)
tract and some parks that have there's (39:48 - 39:52)
there's one park that has two polka (39:50 - 39:56)
stops and a gym like right in the same (39:52 - 39:58)
spot of the park (39:56 - 39:59)
and so that used to be a place where (39:58 - 40:01)
you'd see because you could get to polka (39:59 - 40:04)
stops without walking anywhere you'd see (40:01 - 40:07)
like 30 people standing around and then (40:04 - 40:10)
a rare Pokemon what happened like I've (40:07 - 40:13)
been in stampedes I've been in the like (40:10 - 40:15)
Oh a rare Pokemon just showed up and (40:13 - 40:18)
then some people start running and then (40:15 - 40:19)
everyone's running and everyone's got (40:18 - 40:21)
their phones out yep and there's a (40:19 - 40:24)
little kid showing you the Pikachu that (40:21 - 40:25)
they caught and these are really proud (40:24 - 40:27)
and you like tear up just a little bit (40:25 - 40:29)
because it's just like this like cool (40:27 - 40:31)
weird experience that you're having (40:29 - 40:34)
about a thing that like is so (40:31 - 40:35)
multi-generational like there's (40:34 - 40:37)
something amazing about seeing like (40:35 - 40:39)
little kids and and their parents are (40:37 - 40:41)
their Guardians like playing the game (40:39 - 40:43)
together and couples walking around and (40:41 - 40:46)
like uh and then like everybody you know (40:43 - 40:47)
because when I first came out everyone (40:46 - 40:50)
had their like USB chargers their phone (40:47 - 40:51)
chargers in their back pocket because (40:50 - 40:55)
there was so much battery yeah and it's (40:51 - 40:57)
not it's not that as much anymore but I (40:55 - 41:02)
still see people like uh the other day I (40:57 - 41:04)
someone gave me a really dirty look um (41:02 - 41:07)
and uh when I was like walking through (41:04 - 41:10)
the city and then I realized oh they (41:07 - 41:12)
thought I was trying to take over their (41:10 - 41:14)
gym like that's what I figure it out (41:12 - 41:15)
because it was a gym right there and I (41:14 - 41:17)
my phone out and I was tapping on it and (41:15 - 41:19)
they recognized that I was trying to (41:17 - 41:20)
take over the gym that they were (41:19 - 41:22)
defending cuz suddenly there was like a (41:20 - 41:25)
yellow team there and I'll show that's (41:22 - 41:25)
hilarious (41:25 - 41:28)
that's really funny yeah so like there's (41:25 - 41:30)
it's still out there but it's it's not (41:28 - 41:32)
the phenomenon it was you're not gonna (41:30 - 41:35)
if you go to a central park on a Sunday (41:32 - 41:37)
you're still going to see people but (41:35 - 41:38)
you're not going to see all the people (41:37 - 41:40)
you would see there there was like a (41:38 - 41:42)
central park entrance kind of by the (41:40 - 41:46)
Apple Store is a that were also a lot of (41:42 - 41:48)
the Care drive horses are there were (41:46 - 41:51)
like three polka stops right there so (41:48 - 41:53)
you would see a bunch of people standing (41:51 - 41:56)
around like and you know and then you (41:53 - 41:57)
get the gyro all the lures are out and (41:56 - 42:00)
people are trying to get you know people (41:57 - 42:01)
are cracking eggs and trying to get as (42:00 - 42:03)
many Pokemon as they can you don't see (42:01 - 42:06)
that as much these days at least in New (42:03 - 42:08)
York there other big cities there might (42:06 - 42:11)
be more of a Pokemon go scene I guess (42:08 - 42:13)
the other gate switching to the other (42:11 - 42:16)
game Pokemon Sun yeah you seemed pretty (42:13 - 42:18)
happy with the the changes they made and (42:16 - 42:20)
it seems like you are still playing it (42:18 - 42:23)
even after even after the Elite Four and (42:20 - 42:25)
and the champion is that correct so (42:23 - 42:29)
there's there's the big thing about the (42:25 - 42:31)
you know the old extra stuff the noob (42:29 - 42:34)
you know new game+ like so I'm (42:31 - 42:37)
attempting to you know fill up my (42:34 - 42:40)
pokedex without having to ask someone to (42:37 - 42:41)
just trade me the things I need I'm (42:40 - 42:42)
trying to do it the right way through (42:41 - 42:45)
wonder training and through leveling and (42:42 - 42:47)
and through a little bit of the GTS (42:45 - 42:50)
store the thing I really like is being (42:47 - 42:53)
able to go back to the Elite Four though (42:50 - 42:56)
ends like it still doesn't make it (42:53 - 42:59)
distill doesn't make sense but it makes (42:56 - 43:01)
more sense in previous games yeah as you (42:59 - 43:03)
know obviously previous games you win (43:01 - 43:05)
you beat the Elite Four you beat the (43:03 - 43:07)
champion you're the new champion (43:05 - 43:08)
everything's great (43:07 - 43:10)
you go back to lead for it's as if you (43:08 - 43:12)
never went there and the champion still (43:10 - 43:14)
the old champion and you beat them again (43:12 - 43:18)
and like that's fine except now I really (43:14 - 43:20)
prefer the idea that when you go back to (43:18 - 43:22)
the Elite Four they're like oh yeah well (43:20 - 43:23)
one day I'm going to be in that spot (43:22 - 43:26)
champ and then you go and you go sit (43:23 - 43:28)
back to the champion and then you almost (43:26 - 43:29)
immediately (43:28 - 43:31)
someone has beat the Elite Four and is (43:29 - 43:33)
now trying to challenge you and you have (43:31 - 43:35)
to beat them to keep your spot I you (43:33 - 43:37)
know they never really talked about it (43:35 - 43:38)
in the Pokemon anime but I don't feel (43:37 - 43:40)
like the champion every time the (43:38 - 43:42)
champion wants to go hang out in their (43:40 - 43:45)
area they have to be do it for every (43:42 - 43:46)
time I feel like you don't have to do (43:45 - 43:51)
that so that's a little weird I like to (43:46 - 43:52)
think that like in the real Pokemon game (43:51 - 43:54)
you're out doing stuff and so it's just (43:52 - 43:55)
like hey so impede the Elite Four are (43:54 - 43:57)
you around and then you come back and (43:55 - 44:01)
then that person's there yeah but I'll (43:57 - 44:03)
and I love the random guys I just want (44:01 - 44:05)
to get to my chair yeah you're like come (44:03 - 44:09)
on come on ten are sorry taunt golf lady (44:05 - 44:11)
I know I could beat all of your Pokemon (44:09 - 44:13)
it's not that we don't have to do this (44:11 - 44:14)
my Pokemon are stronger than the last (44:13 - 44:16)
time we fought but there's something (44:14 - 44:18)
really I think really interesting about (44:16 - 44:21)
like being the champion at being the (44:18 - 44:25)
crowned known champion and then having (44:21 - 44:28)
people from other games show up or the (44:25 - 44:31)
first trainer you thought you see in the (44:28 - 44:33)
game show up or are your friends come (44:31 - 44:36)
like and be like you know even the (44:33 - 44:38)
professor being like well I don't know (44:36 - 44:40)
what if I was champion that'd be fun I (44:38 - 44:43)
did create the Elite Four so we finally (44:40 - 44:48)
add one I think that's a really fun (44:43 - 44:50)
twist on it and it to me it it makes it (44:48 - 44:53)
feel like the game world still goes on (44:50 - 44:55)
instead of being in a frozen state once (44:53 - 44:58)
you you know save the world or the (44:55 - 45:01)
universe or time itself or whatever and (44:58 - 45:06)
then also then go and beat five people I (45:01 - 45:08)
enjoy that it adds a little bit of like (45:06 - 45:10)
of the world doesn't feel as you know (45:08 - 45:12)
and of course there was all the extra (45:10 - 45:13)
stuff that came out at the end like uh (45:12 - 45:16)
catching all the ultra beasts and (45:13 - 45:18)
catching some of the legendary Pokemon (45:16 - 45:22)
and beating all the Eevee trainers and I (45:18 - 45:24)
think I've done I've done everything (45:22 - 45:26)
except like I haven't gotten far enough (45:24 - 45:29)
in the battle tree to like beat red and (45:26 - 45:32)
blue I haven't gotten that far but I've (45:29 - 45:33)
done just about everything else you can (45:32 - 45:36)
do in the game and I wish I don't know I (45:33 - 45:39)
maybe maybe I wish there was more at the (45:36 - 45:41)
end of the game but I still really (45:39 - 45:44)
enjoyed it would that lead into you (45:41 - 45:46)
wanting a third version of the game (45:44 - 45:48)
whether because there's rumors that it (45:46 - 45:50)
might be on switch or whatnot but switch (45:48 - 45:53)
3ds the new 2d s they announced what (45:50 - 45:56)
whatever would you want to see a third (45:53 - 45:59)
version of this game yeah III I always (45:56 - 46:02)
liked that I think that um having a (45:59 - 46:04)
battleground salic there's certainly (46:02 - 46:06)
battling there but having a like extra (46:04 - 46:08)
or you know if it's the 3d third (46:06 - 46:10)
dimension one or whatever it is like (46:08 - 46:12)
having some extra stuff maybe finally (46:10 - 46:14)
that maybe there's a safari zone on an (46:12 - 46:17)
island that we didn't reach or you know (46:14 - 46:20)
you have to face the couple people like (46:17 - 46:21)
there's a couple people in the game that (46:20 - 46:23)
I wouldn't mind them flushing out a bit (46:21 - 46:25)
you know like I like to know more about (46:23 - 46:29)
that weird painter a person she gives (46:25 - 46:31)
you a crystal and then later you fight (46:29 - 46:33)
her but like there's nothing like what's (46:31 - 46:34)
going on with that like yeah is there (46:33 - 46:36)
something more to Z moves that they can (46:34 - 46:38)
explore yeah I like the (46:36 - 46:40)
the lady we haven't talked about that (46:38 - 46:42)
much on the show but I kind of forgot (46:40 - 46:44)
about her until you brought her up it (46:42 - 46:46)
seemed like they created her and they (46:44 - 46:47)
were going to use her for something and (46:46 - 46:49)
then they ran out of time and then I (46:47 - 46:51)
just just give them the crystal let's (46:49 - 46:53)
move on we don't have time for this yeah (46:51 - 46:55)
and it kind of makes sense that she's so (46:53 - 46:57)
absent-minded and does it and kind of (46:55 - 47:00)
doesn't want to do this job that she's (46:57 - 47:03)
like here you go but but like okay so if (47:00 - 47:07)
they if they made a sequel then you (47:03 - 47:09)
would need new like you would need new (47:07 - 47:11)
challenged people because those people (47:09 - 47:13)
have moved up to being the Elite Four (47:11 - 47:15)
maybe there's some new leaf or maybe (47:13 - 47:20)
there's some we've seen like a couple (47:15 - 47:22)
characters that are related characters (47:20 - 47:24)
are our old characters there's the (47:22 - 47:27)
there's the there's the big mystery with (47:24 - 47:30)
not the non mystery mystery that they (47:27 - 47:32)
just say but don't really talk about the (47:30 - 47:36)
fact that like Oh clearly the dude on (47:32 - 47:38)
this island that seemingly only you know (47:36 - 47:43)
about is like the dad this missing guy (47:38 - 47:46)
yeah like for some reason land on this (47:43 - 47:48)
island lost his memory and then was just (47:46 - 47:50)
like Pokemon could go in caves and (47:48 - 47:52)
collect stuff for you and I just hang (47:50 - 47:54)
out here here's a bunch of beans yeah (47:52 - 47:56)
here's some beans (47:54 - 47:58)
I'm the bean guy and like that's (47:56 - 48:02)
definitely these people's dad and (47:58 - 48:04)
husband and he's just on this island (48:02 - 48:06)
like okay what about that like there's (48:04 - 48:10)
um there are a few things that you could (48:06 - 48:11)
explore and I bet that's going to be in (48:10 - 48:14)
the in the that'll be in the anime right (48:11 - 48:16)
cuz that's where they can do all that (48:14 - 48:16)
stuff (48:16 - 48:19)
yeah yeah like I feel like they I (48:16 - 48:20)
haven't I haven't watched the anime (48:19 - 48:23)
because I've always watched it dubbed so (48:20 - 48:25)
I have to I decide I'm gonna wait I'm (48:23 - 48:28)
not gonna watch the fansubs because that (48:25 - 48:31)
feels weird to me I agree because I'm (48:28 - 48:33)
just so used to it I also like look it's (48:31 - 48:34)
a minor thing I'm not I'm not (48:33 - 48:36)
name-dropping here but it is a fact that (48:34 - 48:38)
like my friend Sarah is a sh (48:36 - 48:40)
when they move when Pokemon moved to (48:38 - 48:42)
Comedy Central I'm sorry Cartoon Network (48:40 - 48:44)
excite when Pokemon moved to Cartoon (48:42 - 48:47)
Network and they redid the cast my (48:44 - 48:50)
friend Sarah became the voice of Ash and (48:47 - 48:52)
it's very weak it's very (48:50 - 48:56)
weird to like know that yeah that's who (48:52 - 48:58)
ashes to me and like even though they (48:56 - 49:01)
this a it from the look at the anime (48:58 - 49:04)
they like D Age gym and like it's weird (49:01 - 49:06)
and almost like a reboot yeah I don't (49:04 - 49:09)
know yeah they have the first two (49:06 - 49:11)
episodes on Disney XD and I watched them (49:09 - 49:13)
and I really liked them I like the new (49:11 - 49:16)
art style I like the animation I liked (49:13 - 49:19)
all the voices yeah but I've heard just (49:16 - 49:20)
from people who have already watched the (49:19 - 49:22)
Japanese stuff that it's more (49:20 - 49:26)
kid-friendly than ever which I thought (49:22 - 49:28)
was a little bit of a bummer again I (49:26 - 49:30)
haven't seen it but but also that makes (49:28 - 49:34)
sense like the thing with the anime was (49:30 - 49:37)
like it got dark like the movies are (49:34 - 49:39)
dark because you can do that in movies (49:37 - 49:42)
but even the anime itself it's like man (49:39 - 49:44)
the world is being threatened again and (49:42 - 49:47)
like I mean we all remember the fact (49:44 - 49:48)
that there are Pokemon that art poke (49:47 - 49:50)
there aren't from this earth that are (49:48 - 49:52)
aliens that tried to hypnotize everyone (49:50 - 49:54)
and take over the world that was like a (49:52 - 49:57)
Pokemon story arc for a long time and (49:54 - 50:00)
then that was unresolved there's like (49:57 - 50:02)
there's a bunch of being like you know (50:00 - 50:04)
freezing time taking over the world (50:02 - 50:06)
destroying the world odd stuff like (50:04 - 50:08)
ashes save the world so many times and (50:06 - 50:11)
but then still can't win like a Pokemon (50:08 - 50:14)
tournament yep and so I like the idea of (50:11 - 50:17)
kind of restarting it for maybe a (50:14 - 50:20)
younger generation because who knows if (50:17 - 50:21)
the last series (50:20 - 50:23)
you know appeal to people and like the (50:21 - 50:25)
other thing is if you kind of start (50:23 - 50:26)
fresh then you don't have to have like (50:25 - 50:28)
we don't need to have Brock come back we (50:26 - 50:31)
don't need to have like friend like (50:28 - 50:32)
Cynthia doesn't have to show up and then (50:31 - 50:34)
you have to be like a kid who just (50:32 - 50:35)
started watching Pokemon last year and (50:34 - 50:38)
you're like who is this I don't know who (50:35 - 50:40)
this is you know yeah like it I (50:38 - 50:43)
appreciate that they're restarting it a (50:40 - 50:44)
bit I don't know if it's going to be for (50:43 - 50:47)
me but I'm interested in it I like the (50:44 - 50:49)
idea of the kind of playing up the (50:47 - 50:52)
school element instead of just being (50:49 - 50:54)
like in the game where you you went to (50:52 - 50:56)
school for like a day and you beat all (50:54 - 50:58)
the kids at that school and then you (50:56 - 51:01)
beat the principal you're done like okay (50:58 - 51:04)
instead of like ash has to go to Pokemon (51:01 - 51:06)
school with his buddy Pikachu (51:04 - 51:09)
I think that's like a cool idea totally (51:06 - 51:12)
it's kind of like the when they rebooted (51:09 - 51:14)
you yo and it was completely different (51:12 - 51:17)
except it was yu-gi-oh but it was like (51:14 - 51:22)
kids in a weird school I can't (51:17 - 51:24)
understand it's like when they reboot (51:22 - 51:27)
Digimon every single season yes except (51:24 - 51:30)
that every Digimon is the same cannon as (51:27 - 51:32)
far as I can tell like I'm not I'm not (51:30 - 51:35)
hey I'm no Digimon expert but I believe (51:32 - 51:38)
that it's that it's just like a new (51:35 - 51:40)
batch of people but all the old people (51:38 - 51:41)
still have Digimon and they're all there (51:40 - 51:45)
and it's all of one universe I'm pretty (51:41 - 51:47)
sure yeah but you could you could start (51:45 - 51:49)
at season three but you're not arguing (51:47 - 51:52)
you could start - and I think Pokemon (51:49 - 51:54)
became in the same way the game is a bit (51:52 - 51:56)
of a behemoth um which is why I (51:54 - 51:58)
appreciate it like we were talking about (51:56 - 52:00)
some of the changes and I didn't mention (51:58 - 52:01)
one of my favorites which is like (52:00 - 52:04)
telling you on screen a move that is not (52:01 - 52:05)
effective are super effective or (52:04 - 52:08)
effective or no effect once you've done (52:05 - 52:10)
it once you've beaten that Pokemon type (52:08 - 52:13)
like that's idiot it's an incredible (52:10 - 52:14)
change just a quality of life because (52:13 - 52:17)
like I don't remember what beats fairy (52:14 - 52:20)
like I do but you don't I mean like when (52:17 - 52:21)
they added Pokemon type you're like and (52:20 - 52:24)
then some Pokemon or now that type but (52:21 - 52:25)
they were normal but oh we didn't (52:24 - 52:27)
realize they were a fairy type this (52:25 - 52:28)
whole time you're like well that means (52:27 - 52:30)
it different move steel was good now (52:28 - 52:33)
okay I guess I have to have a hookup (52:30 - 52:35)
with Pokemon that of Steel types because (52:33 - 52:37)
they're like art steel moves because (52:35 - 52:39)
there are fairies now or whatever it's (52:37 - 52:41)
it's nice to have that thing we're like (52:39 - 52:43)
oh I don't know what kind of Pokemon (52:41 - 52:45)
this is yet I will say this my biggest (52:43 - 52:48)
criticism of Sun and Moon is that there (52:45 - 52:51)
were too many Pokemon that early on that (52:48 - 52:54)
we already had seen for a while there my (52:51 - 52:58)
uh my main team was mostly Pokemon that (52:54 - 53:01)
I've already played another game and I (52:58 - 53:04)
think that's annoying yeah I was it was (53:01 - 53:05)
a thing I was like oh that's a well it's (53:04 - 53:08)
a bird type or a flying type and it also (53:05 - 53:10)
has water moves water flying type so I (53:08 - 53:12)
guess I'm going to use a Pokemon I would (53:10 - 53:16)
use it forever you know mm-hmm my only (53:12 - 53:18)
my only complaint with Sun and Moon was (53:16 - 53:20)
you know it's only a can (53:18 - 53:22)
when you think about it in the future (53:20 - 53:25)
they hold your hand a ton on that first (53:22 - 53:26)
island and I think that's fine (53:25 - 53:28)
especially because they're actually (53:26 - 53:31)
setting up a story too but I always (53:28 - 53:32)
thought like oh I (53:31 - 53:35)
I completed son love son I have a copy (53:32 - 53:37)
of Moon Man I don't want to do that (53:35 - 53:39)
first island again it was great the (53:37 - 53:42)
first time yeah and that's I mean that's (53:39 - 53:46)
any Pokemon game that's any that's any I (53:42 - 53:47)
mean not any game but that's a lot of (53:46 - 53:51)
RPGs like I have a every couple years I (53:47 - 53:55)
revisit I'll either play the original uh (53:51 - 53:58)
persona 4 or I'll play golden on the (53:55 - 54:04)
Vita and man it's ours you play four (53:58 - 54:07)
hours before you get to do anything like (54:04 - 54:09)
it hit it hold your hand and you can't (54:07 - 54:11)
go out at night you can't do it's like (54:09 - 54:14)
so it's so hard to get over that first (54:11 - 54:16)
hump but I love that it's one of my (54:14 - 54:18)
favorite games of all time so it's like (54:16 - 54:20)
worth getting over the hump but it's (54:18 - 54:22)
really annoying (54:20 - 54:24)
I was playing percentage to you know (54:22 - 54:25)
side track of it I smoked playing (54:24 - 54:27)
persona 5 and I'm not really into it and (54:25 - 54:30)
I miss persona 4 so much that I just (54:27 - 54:32)
watching the anime because I was like I (54:30 - 54:33)
I'm not going to go back to PS I'm not (54:32 - 54:35)
gonna play persona 4 again I played it (54:33 - 54:38)
like less than a year ago so I was like (54:35 - 54:40)
I'll watch cup ups of the anime it's (54:38 - 54:42)
like playing the game try to deal with (54:40 - 54:44)
that but yeah with Pokemon it's like (54:42 - 54:46)
yeah I wouldn't mind restarting this (54:44 - 54:47)
game it would probably hold my hand a (54:46 - 54:51)
little bit but it might be nice to start (54:47 - 54:52)
off with some other Pokemon that I (54:51 - 54:54)
didn't play right away that I kind of (54:52 - 54:56)
let sitting around the realize later (54:54 - 54:58)
it's like oh this is kind of cool but I (54:56 - 55:01)
look at my main six right now and some (54:58 - 55:03)
of them are (55:01 - 55:07)
gen1 pokemon or Gentoo pokemon like (55:03 - 55:11)
right i I don't I did not enjoy that or (55:07 - 55:13)
or if it had been those it should have (55:11 - 55:15)
been the hello a little version of the (55:13 - 55:19)
right but not just hey here's a (55:15 - 55:21)
Magnemite you caught a Magnemite and (55:19 - 55:23)
it's electric steel and you don't have (55:21 - 55:25)
either of those so you're gonna use it (55:23 - 55:28)
but it's a Magnemite and that's boring (55:25 - 55:32)
yeah totally agree yeah so I ended up (55:28 - 55:34)
like switching things out and I'm glad I (55:32 - 55:36)
did because like two cannon is one of my (55:34 - 55:39)
favorite new pokemon i love to canada to (55:36 - 55:43)
me you're just so mad he's just edited i (55:39 - 55:46)
love pokemon that changed personality (55:43 - 55:47)
when they evolved i think that's such a (55:46 - 55:49)
fun thing i wish more more of the (55:47 - 55:51)
pokemon did that so to be like i'm a (55:49 - 55:54)
tiny bird i'm a bigger bird I'm a giant (55:51 - 55:57)
toucan with the attitude it's very fun (55:54 - 56:00)
to me and but like I switched to him (55:57 - 56:02)
because I was like even though I didn't (56:00 - 56:04)
have a strong water type at the time I (56:02 - 56:07)
was I was just like I don't want (56:04 - 56:09)
pelipper or whatever like I don't I (56:07 - 56:12)
don't want this Pokemon that I used in (56:09 - 56:16)
other games uh so I kind of fought on (56:12 - 56:18)
that one instance I forced myself and (56:16 - 56:21)
then like I mean there's some Pokemon (56:18 - 56:23)
that like crab brawler I'm gonna put on (56:21 - 56:25)
my team no matter what yeah even though (56:23 - 56:28)
I think that his uh the he's evolved (56:25 - 56:30)
form when he becomes half fighting half (56:28 - 56:32)
ice I don't think it's as good I don't (56:30 - 56:34)
think he looks as cool but crab brawler (56:32 - 56:38)
is like the best the fact that he always (56:34 - 56:40)
has a black eye and that when you like (56:38 - 56:43)
that he like wants to fight and is just (56:40 - 56:45)
like ready to go he's just and we've (56:43 - 56:48)
also obviously already had a punching (56:45 - 56:51)
fighting crab that's literally like (56:48 - 56:53)
lobster crab like that's not something (56:51 - 56:56)
new in Pokemon but he still just got so (56:53 - 56:58)
much personality that I've totally loved (56:56 - 57:00)
him that's awesome (56:58 - 57:02)
yeah and you know one of the things (57:00 - 57:04)
about Sun Moon is the Pokemon have (57:02 - 57:07)
personality because you're going to you (57:04 - 57:09)
know do your they they figured out how (57:07 - 57:11)
to do face touching in a Pokemon game (57:09 - 57:12)
you know you go and take care of them I (57:11 - 57:15)
love that Snorlax is so big you have to (57:12 - 57:17)
scroll up and is like a sleep when you (57:15 - 57:19)
winning kind of wakes up every time like (57:17 - 57:22)
yeah I love the attitude that some of (57:19 - 57:24)
them have I love that like you know it's (57:22 - 57:26)
like it's like oh this Pokemon is kind (57:24 - 57:27)
of like a tea now ah (57:26 - 57:30)
so he's like real like emo looking and (57:27 - 57:32)
then like kind of doesn't love that your (57:30 - 57:34)
take care of him but he does like it's (57:32 - 57:36)
just like little weird touches that I I (57:34 - 57:40)
think are a really fun in that game and (57:36 - 57:42)
and totally like there's always (57:40 - 57:44)
something about Pokemon that were it's (57:42 - 57:46)
like hey why did you spend so much time (57:44 - 57:49)
on this weird thing which I appreciate (57:46 - 57:51)
no yeah I totally agree let's let's (57:49 - 57:54)
switch gears a little bit okay too much (57:51 - 57:57)
Pokemon no I'm just kidding though that (57:54 - 57:59)
was awesome you're going to be at PAX (57:57 - 58:02)
West yes you are going to be doing your (57:59 - 58:04)
your panel four or foreing it mm-hmm yep (58:02 - 58:07)
four oh four yeah as I mentioned is a (58:04 - 58:11)
it's a comedy on purpose funny a comedy (58:07 - 58:13)
panel that looks at the best size of the (58:11 - 58:16)
internet myself and three guests bring (58:13 - 58:20)
videos and photos and just sometimes we (58:16 - 58:22)
talk about like trending things that are (58:20 - 58:23)
like hey this is a cool thing happening (58:22 - 58:24)
in the internet and sometimes it's just (58:23 - 58:27)
like oh thank god someone on YouTube (58:24 - 58:30)
uploaded this old weird instructional (58:27 - 58:33)
video because I would have never seen it (58:30 - 58:34)
but now it's on YouTube and now we can (58:33 - 58:37)
all look at it that kind of stuff I like (58:34 - 58:39)
to say that my show is on purpose (58:37 - 58:42)
positive and I've been doing it paksas (58:39 - 58:43)
for a number of years I ran a (58:42 - 58:46)
Kickstarter which ended on May 6th for (58:43 - 58:50)
to send me out to Seattle so that go the (58:46 - 58:52)
it will be filmed I have a YouTube (58:50 - 58:56)
channel youtube.com slash Pat bear that (58:52 - 58:59)
has a playlist of all the four or four (58:56 - 59:01)
nights that I've done live so people (58:59 - 59:02)
that want to kind of check out what I do (59:01 - 59:04)
can go and watch those live panels there (59:02 - 59:08)
do you notice at those panels that you (59:04 - 59:10)
have a lot of first-timers or do you (59:08 - 59:14)
have you know a bunch of recurring fans (59:10 - 59:17)
or how does that seem to play out so it (59:14 - 59:19)
is a mix um I have some people that just (59:17 - 59:21)
come because the description sounded (59:19 - 59:23)
interesting to them which is great I (59:21 - 59:25)
have some people that come because oh (59:23 - 59:27)
I'd never heard of your thing but you (59:25 - 59:29)
have a guest like I I try to be broadly (59:27 - 59:32)
of people that look at my pain (59:29 - 59:34)
can see a pattern in which that I often (59:32 - 59:36)
almost always have someone from Giant (59:34 - 59:39)
Bomb and one that's because they're good (59:36 - 59:41)
at being presenters there they're used (59:39 - 59:43)
to it I think that some game devs and (59:41 - 59:45)
some game journalists don't have is you (59:43 - 59:47)
know public speaking skills there it's (59:45 - 59:49)
not their Forte so I find the people (59:47 - 59:50)
that are good at that and giantbomb (59:49 - 59:52)
folks are good at that (59:50 - 59:54)
but also have a huge following and that (59:52 - 59:55)
benefits me because if I'm in a room (59:54 - 59:58)
that seats 900 I'm gonna do everything I (59:55 - 60:01)
can to fill those seats but I also try (59:58 - 60:02)
to pick interesting people that maybe (60:01 - 60:05)
maybe you don't necessarily know but do (60:02 - 60:07)
cool interesting things on the internet (60:05 - 60:11)
now or are just funny fun people so I (60:07 - 60:13)
try to mix the the guests up and I do (60:11 - 60:14)
get a lot of people that are like I (60:13 - 60:16)
follow so-and-so on Twitter and they (60:14 - 60:18)
said that they're gonna be at this panel (60:16 - 60:21)
I had and then they like it generally I (60:18 - 60:24)
think I've IV view they were like oh I (60:21 - 60:26)
don't know anything about you but Mary (60:24 - 60:27)
Kish said she was gonna be here so I (60:26 - 60:32)
came and this is the best uh and so uh I (60:27 - 60:34)
didn't and I have friends who are like I (60:32 - 60:36)
go to packs a night this is one of the (60:34 - 60:38)
things I look forward to and I work my (60:36 - 60:40)
schedule around it I do have people that (60:38 - 60:42)
you know they come to PAX East in Boston (60:40 - 60:46)
and they watch the PAX West one on live (60:42 - 60:50)
or they watch my archive of it later and (60:46 - 60:51)
then vice versa I have people that are (60:50 - 60:53)
like oh I can't go to every packed or I (60:51 - 60:54)
can't go to pax anymore but I still (60:53 - 60:56)
watch your panel and that's I send them (60:54 - 60:57)
yeah like I said there are some people (60:56 - 60:59)
that are just like oh I saw that on the (60:57 - 61:02)
schedule and it looked funny and so here (60:59 - 61:03)
I am (61:02 - 61:06)
or you were at the cards and humanity (61:03 - 61:08)
booth and mentioned that you had a panel (61:06 - 61:10)
or I go i watch league of heals the (61:08 - 61:13)
wrestling show and I I guess some of the (61:10 - 61:15)
people are also on your thing so yeah (61:13 - 61:19)
I'm going to that it's nice when I only (61:15 - 61:22)
did I've done two of the three times (61:19 - 61:24)
that pack South has happened in San (61:22 - 61:26)
Antonio I've gone I didn't go this past (61:24 - 61:30)
year 2017 but I went 15 and 16 and that (61:26 - 61:33)
audience is mostly people who've never (61:30 - 61:36)
been to a pax before because they most (61:33 - 61:38)
of that audience is people that flew in (61:36 - 61:40)
from other parts of Texas because text (61:38 - 61:44)
is so stupid thing so big that it's a (61:40 - 61:45)
convention for them (61:44 - 61:48)
and it's their convention and so I had a (61:45 - 61:49)
bunch people they were just like the (61:48 - 61:51)
first year there was only two rooms (61:49 - 61:53)
added panels so my panel was on Friday (61:51 - 61:56)
at one o'clock and was like a thousand (61:53 - 61:58)
people came and I know that are you sure (61:56 - 62:01)
that that that was me because I was like (61:58 - 62:03)
there's I think that's how I discovered (62:01 - 62:05)
you to because I've you had a Giant Bomb (62:03 - 62:08)
guy it was there was really no panels it (62:05 - 62:09)
was one of the first packs I've ever (62:08 - 62:12)
been to I was like I got an hour to kill (62:09 - 62:15)
let's see this and yeah it was it was (62:12 - 62:18)
super entertaining that one I'm proud of (62:15 - 62:19)
that one that one was really fun my (62:18 - 62:20)
second pax (62:19 - 62:23)
south was good too and that one you know (62:20 - 62:26)
a little bigger a bigger venue our (62:23 - 62:28)
audience the audience had grown a little (62:26 - 62:30)
bit but yeah that first pack south (62:28 - 62:31)
people were just looking for something (62:30 - 62:33)
great and I was happy to give them (62:31 - 62:36)
something and I was so so thrilled that (62:33 - 62:38)
Jeff Gerstmann could be there of Giant (62:36 - 62:39)
Bomb um (62:38 - 62:41)
because I was like Jeff is a great (62:39 - 62:43)
panelist I just had him this year in (62:41 - 62:47)
Boston again he's one of my favorite (62:43 - 62:48)
guests to have but I also was like (62:47 - 62:51)
that's gonna be real good because people (62:48 - 62:53)
will come to see him because if they (62:51 - 62:55)
haven't been to Boston or Seattle they (62:53 - 62:58)
probably haven't seen him do a thing so (62:55 - 63:00)
I'm a producer by Nature (62:58 - 63:03)
and a performer but I you know I try to (63:00 - 63:06)
pick people that I think will be (63:03 - 63:08)
interesting I also it's very small but (63:06 - 63:10)
if you watch like a bunch of my panels (63:08 - 63:14)
you'll see four white dudes in their 20s (63:10 - 63:17)
and 30s and then I slowly branch out as (63:14 - 63:20)
I've met more cool awesome people they (63:17 - 63:23)
happen to be uh not just like me and (63:20 - 63:25)
that has been a nice thing to be able to (63:23 - 63:27)
do that and sometimes those people are (63:25 - 63:29)
very well known in the industry Austin (63:27 - 63:30)
Walker's done my panel a couple times (63:29 - 63:32)
and people will know him very well but (63:30 - 63:33)
then there's some people that I'm like (63:32 - 63:35)
you don't know how awesome this person (63:33 - 63:35)
is (63:35 - 63:37)
they're like an artist on the internet (63:35 - 63:40)
and they're amazing and you should check (63:37 - 63:42)
them out like I've been able to start (63:40 - 63:44)
doing that because I'm not as worried as (63:42 - 63:46)
I used to be about putting butts in the (63:44 - 63:48)
seats because I've I've now done it for (63:46 - 63:51)
like five years so yeah I feel like it (63:48 - 63:55)
it seems like pax kind of guarantees you (63:51 - 63:57)
in at this point you know there's always (63:55 - 63:58)
the chance that one time they'll be like (63:57 - 63:59)
we don't have room for (63:58 - 64:01)
you um I don't see that necessarily (63:59 - 64:03)
happening I have a good relationship (64:01 - 64:06)
with other people that put together from (64:03 - 64:08)
read that kind of put together the (64:06 - 64:10)
programming Jerry knows my name and my (64:08 - 64:13)
face which is nice to have it's not a (64:10 - 64:14)
garret that's not a guarantee of (64:13 - 64:17)
anything but um put the staff especially (64:14 - 64:21)
it read know me and know that I generate (64:17 - 64:24)
an audience and I do a panel that works (64:21 - 64:26)
pretty well on their twitch stream (64:24 - 64:28)
because it's very visual whereas you (64:26 - 64:30)
know some panels just are people talking (64:28 - 64:33)
and they don't they're not as awesome to (64:30 - 64:35)
be live-streamed but I think my panel (64:33 - 64:37)
works pretty well there for for (64:35 - 64:40)
audiences watching at home and we yeah (64:37 - 64:41)
we have a good relationship and then (64:40 - 64:45)
also like I am NOT a hard person to work (64:41 - 64:48)
with I try not to be anyway because well (64:45 - 64:50)
because of my comedy background because (64:48 - 64:52)
I'm the tech director and a tech person (64:50 - 64:56)
like I know what my show I know what for (64:52 - 64:58)
for any needs and so I am a broken (64:56 - 65:01)
record about that but I also know how to (64:58 - 65:02)
get it done and what I need to do to get (65:01 - 65:05)
it done I don't show up and go hey uh we (65:02 - 65:07)
have a PowerPoint on a USB I'm like (65:05 - 65:10)
here's my laptop here's my backup laptop (65:07 - 65:12)
here's here's it on a USB just in case (65:10 - 65:15)
it's on a Google Drive like because my (65:12 - 65:17)
show is a PowerPoint I have I have it on (65:15 - 65:19)
my phone I have it on my iPad Mini I (65:17 - 65:22)
have my lightning to HDMI adapter I've (65:19 - 65:25)
got a VGA adapter for a laptop like I'm (65:22 - 65:27)
not I might be a weird show to produce (65:25 - 65:30)
at PAX but I'm not (65:27 - 65:32)
I know how to get it done yeah yeah in (65:30 - 65:33)
the same thing with league of fuels our (65:32 - 65:35)
wrestling show which we were doing for a (65:33 - 65:37)
few years now yeah talk about that a (65:35 - 65:39)
little bit I know I know some listeners (65:37 - 65:41)
were all their eyes when they when they (65:39 - 65:43)
hear the word wrestling oh yeah so we're (65:41 - 65:44)
going to talk wrestling on a podcast (65:43 - 65:47)
it's not about wrestling at a K every (65:44 - 65:48)
podcast has a little bit of wrestling (65:47 - 65:52)
talk in it so here's the thing the two (65:48 - 65:55)
things I hear from fans of our panel who (65:52 - 65:57)
come to the panel I hear two things one (65:55 - 66:00)
I love wrestling I'm so glad there's (65:57 - 66:02)
some wrestling here and - I hate (66:00 - 66:06)
wrestling this show is so funny uh it I (66:02 - 66:08)
honestly feel because the so they can (66:06 - 66:10)
see it is there two versions of it (66:08 - 66:12)
because it is that um once a year we (66:10 - 66:13)
play (66:12 - 66:15)
royal rumble mode which is 30 players (66:13 - 66:18)
for at a time and you fight until you (66:15 - 66:19)
get knocked out of the ring and then (66:18 - 66:21)
someone takes over and so we get thirty (66:19 - 66:23)
video game journalists and developers (66:21 - 66:27)
and comedians and musicians that are at (66:23 - 66:29)
PAX together and some come up with (66:27 - 66:33)
characters some are you know wrestling (66:29 - 66:37)
characters some are evil witches and and (66:33 - 66:41)
Steve Kim fob washed on Twitter just (66:37 - 66:44)
played like a eSports Korean version he (66:41 - 66:46)
is Korean so you play like an eSports (66:44 - 66:48)
version of himself that was really funny (66:46 - 66:51)
um some people like have personas and (66:48 - 66:53)
some people are just like hey I'm Chris (66:51 - 66:56)
Kohler from formerly of Wired now Kotaku (66:53 - 66:58)
and I'm playing this game and I'm good (66:56 - 67:01)
at video games like there's that kind of (66:58 - 67:03)
thing and so we kind of created this (67:01 - 67:05)
mythos in the story and then also once a (67:03 - 67:07)
year we do a more of a storytelling show (67:05 - 67:10)
where we play different games and it's (67:07 - 67:12)
more about like trash talking and it's (67:10 - 67:14)
called League of heals because almost (67:12 - 67:16)
everyone is a bad guy because it's more (67:14 - 67:18)
fun it's more fun to be an evil (67:16 - 67:20)
character than it is to be a good guy (67:18 - 67:22)
it's so much so that it's very fun when (67:20 - 67:24)
we have a few people that are like oh no (67:22 - 67:26)
the audience loves you you're too nice (67:24 - 67:28)
you have to be a nice character it's (67:26 - 67:30)
it's very fun with the audiences like (67:28 - 67:33)
know your trash talk is adorable sorry (67:30 - 67:35)
and the one of the reasons I love it is (67:33 - 67:38)
because it's unlike anything else at PAX (67:35 - 67:41)
it's incredibly presentational it's a (67:38 - 67:44)
story it's character work it's a huge (67:41 - 67:46)
cast and another nice thing about League (67:44 - 67:49)
of heels is because it started with a (67:46 - 67:51)
lot of there still are a lot of Giant (67:49 - 67:52)
Bomb people in it so we kind of drew (67:51 - 67:54)
from their audience and then built our (67:52 - 67:56)
own people that love the Harmonix social (67:54 - 67:59)
media crew at the time people that loved (67:56 - 68:01)
different game developers that came in (67:59 - 68:03)
early there were early adopters but then (68:01 - 68:05)
their characters that you don't know (68:03 - 68:07)
like one of our best champions with (68:05 - 68:10)
Samantha Coleman who made centrist she's (68:07 - 68:12)
an independent he just joined up with a (68:10 - 68:14)
company I which name I can't remember (68:12 - 68:17)
where she ended up it might have been an (68:14 - 68:19)
Amazon please don't call me on that but (68:17 - 68:21)
she just got a job she's an independent (68:19 - 68:23)
that some people would never have met (68:21 - 68:25)
but because she became our champion a (68:23 - 68:27)
bunch of people were like oh let me (68:25 - 68:29)
check this out we hear that a lot like (68:27 - 68:31)
oh I never played gang beefs but then (68:29 - 68:34)
one of the guys who made gang B's showed (68:31 - 68:36)
up and he seemed so nice that I'm gonna (68:34 - 68:38)
go play that game or I don't know (68:36 - 68:41)
anything about iron galaxy but Dave Lang (68:38 - 68:42)
seems like a crazy person (68:41 - 68:46)
so let me go play some let me go play (68:42 - 68:48)
divekick because that dude seems crazy (68:46 - 68:51)
and cool and it's been a nice little way (68:48 - 68:53)
for us to take a you don't know Kate (68:51 - 68:55)
Welch but you gotta know Kate Welch (68:53 - 68:57)
because Kate Walsh is awesome and now (68:55 - 68:58)
more people will know Kate Welch because (68:57 - 68:59)
she's doing um (68:58 - 69:04)
she's on the C team for Penny arcade's a (68:59 - 69:07)
D&D game inquisitions Inc they just (69:04 - 69:10)
started like a new livestream of that (69:07 - 69:12)
like a weekly show and Kate is on that (69:10 - 69:14)
and so people are gonna fall in love (69:12 - 69:16)
with how cool and awesome Kate Welch is (69:14 - 69:18)
but also they're people were just like (69:16 - 69:21)
she had a Rocketeer mask so that girl (69:18 - 69:24)
rules you know that kind of thing and (69:21 - 69:25)
then the other people just like yeah I (69:24 - 69:27)
don't care about wrestling but I like (69:25 - 69:29)
seeing John Drake wear a suit made out (69:27 - 69:32)
of money so I'm gonna come to this weird (69:29 - 69:35)
show and the people that love wrestling (69:32 - 69:38)
get to yeah they get their fill they get (69:35 - 69:39)
a little bit of wrestling you know they (69:38 - 69:42)
get to see like z WD performer Xavier (69:39 - 69:45)
woods cut a video promo package for us (69:42 - 69:48)
and so they get to have that and there (69:45 - 69:50)
are old school wrestling references and (69:48 - 69:53)
and in jokes that we kind of pepper in (69:50 - 69:57)
for the die-hard fans and then there's (69:53 - 69:59)
people just like I played a lot of that (69:57 - 70:03)
n64 WrestleMania game so Wrestlemania (69:59 - 70:06)
2000 for the n64 so it's nice to see (70:03 - 70:10)
that terrible game being played awesome (70:06 - 70:12)
so I'm the I'm the person at least (70:10 - 70:14)
everyone is very self-deprecating about (70:12 - 70:16)
Lea heals we say it's terrible we were (70:14 - 70:17)
like oh I can't believe they keep (70:16 - 70:19)
letting us do that all that stuff (70:17 - 70:20)
I'm the guy that doesn't do that because (70:19 - 70:23)
while there are some parts that drag I (70:20 - 70:24)
honestly feel like it's a very cool (70:23 - 70:28)
weird show and the most unique thing at (70:24 - 70:31)
any pax that you're going to see I think (70:28 - 70:33)
it's a spectacle in a way that outside (70:31 - 70:35)
of the musical acts no one is doing (70:33 - 70:37)
spectacle like you know cards against (70:35 - 70:41)
humanity does pranks and stunts (70:37 - 70:43)
and and and I think that they're they're (70:41 - 70:45)
great at that but their panels are still (70:43 - 70:48)
mostly like hey pitch us cards for our (70:45 - 70:50)
game which is really fun but I think (70:48 - 70:54)
League of keels is the only truly weird (70:50 - 70:57)
unique panel at PAX and so you're gonna (70:54 - 71:00)
be at PAX West with or for in it and (70:57 - 71:04)
family meals Niels is returning League (71:00 - 71:04)
of heals (71:04 - 71:07)
I mean look like I said they can always (71:04 - 71:09)
be like we don't want to do this anymore (71:07 - 71:11)
and when it comes to league of fields (71:09 - 71:13)
they have case we had an incident that (71:11 - 71:15)
we had two years ago we had to clear out (71:13 - 71:19)
a hotel room at PAX so a hotel ballroom (71:15 - 71:24)
FX because of legal fields so there is (71:19 - 71:26)
probably justification for them like we (71:24 - 71:29)
shouldn't do this anymore but also all (71:26 - 71:30)
signs point to they're going to keep (71:29 - 71:32)
letting us do it and I'll have another (71:30 - 71:35)
panel pop possibly another comedy panel (71:32 - 71:38)
that's not for flooring it but is (71:35 - 71:41)
similar in nature that one I don't know (71:38 - 71:43)
if it'll be approved so I'm not talking (71:41 - 71:45)
vocally about it other than they say I (71:43 - 71:47)
submitted another idea for a panel and (71:45 - 71:49)
they might accept it got it (71:47 - 71:52)
cool cool well I only have one more (71:49 - 71:54)
question for you pat okay what is your (71:52 - 71:57)
favorite Pokemon you know I did I did (71:54 - 71:58)
some thinking about this because I (71:57 - 72:01)
thought you might ask you know it's a (71:58 - 72:05)
Pokemon podcast yeah yeah I have I have (72:01 - 72:09)
to UM okay and so my first answer for (72:05 - 72:11)
for years and years and years my (72:09 - 72:15)
favorite Pokemon was maka hito me (72:11 - 72:16)
makuhita (72:15 - 72:19)
um because I like Pokemon that looked (72:16 - 72:23)
like humans he's just a big I I like (72:19 - 72:24)
Pokemon like like Snorlax he's a big (72:23 - 72:27)
normal type that can learn a bunch of (72:24 - 72:29)
different moves like I like a Pokemon (72:27 - 72:31)
that can learn earthquake and surf and (72:29 - 72:35)
it looks like a goofy dummy uh so I love (72:31 - 72:38)
Tim Brown um but I will say that my new (72:35 - 72:41)
favorite Pokemon is actually Snorlax I (72:38 - 72:42)
never gave Snorlax a chance (72:41 - 72:46)
I love Snorlax in the anime and there's (72:42 - 72:48)
just something great and in Sun and Moon (72:46 - 72:51)
Sona Lux help me out in so many jams and (72:48 - 72:54)
also saw relaxants like (72:51 - 72:58)
personalized eat ritzy move is (72:54 - 73:01)
polarizing pancake it's so amazing the (72:58 - 73:03)
end like watch it on youtube if you (73:01 - 73:05)
haven't done it I encourage everyone (73:03 - 73:07)
just the from the idea that it's you're (73:05 - 73:10)
standing on a sleeping Snorlax and then (73:07 - 73:12)
he turns to the camera and his eyes (73:10 - 73:14)
light up and then it's just like and (73:12 - 73:16)
then some relax is just amazing and just (73:14 - 73:19)
like fast and jumping really high and (73:16 - 73:21)
like being incredible and to me that's (73:19 - 73:23)
like my favorite thing about thinking (73:21 - 73:24)
about that pokémon its door locks just (73:23 - 73:28)
like Solex is it lazy Snorlax is saving (73:24 - 73:30)
up its energy when you really need (73:28 - 73:34)
Snorlax to save the day uh and I love (73:30 - 73:35)
that sausage is like yeah I could run (73:34 - 73:37)
and jump around or I could just punch a (73:35 - 73:40)
thing once a day like there's something (73:37 - 73:42)
about so excited and it's similar to why (73:40 - 73:46)
I love makuhita uh is just like this (73:42 - 73:49)
like I like those kind of big Brawley uh (73:46 - 73:52)
goofy Pokemon like that sure no totally (73:49 - 73:55)
totally awesome where can our listeners (73:52 - 73:58)

and I was like okay that's a pretty good (74:45 - 74:49)
summing up I just ranted about the (74:46 - 74:51)
differences between persona 4 the (74:49 - 74:54)
persona 4 golden the anime for no one I (74:51 - 74:56)
don't know if anyone appreciated that (74:54 - 74:58)
but I had some thoughts on how weird the (74:56 - 75:01)
persona 4 golden anime is and my (74:58 - 75:03)
favorite part of the Furby persona for (75:01 - 75:06)
anime there which I'm going to say right (75:03 - 75:07)
now okay I'm going to tell you right now (75:06 - 75:08)
episode (75:07 - 75:11)
13 of the persona 4 animation is my (75:08 - 75:13)
favorite episode of that series because (75:11 - 75:16)
it is uh Nanako is trying to figure out (75:13 - 75:19)
what her big bro you the main character (75:16 - 75:21)
is has been doing at night and during (75:19 - 75:23)
the day because he's been really busy uh (75:21 - 75:25)
and it's really her discovering that he (75:23 - 75:27)
has social links with all those all (75:25 - 75:28)
those random characters from persona (75:27 - 75:30)
that like don't fight with you like the (75:28 - 75:33)
old lady and the nurse and the kid that (75:30 - 75:35)
you tutor and the kid that you babysit (75:33 - 75:37)
all those people like are interacting (75:35 - 75:40)
with you the main character and Nanako (75:37 - 75:42)
is like discovering it and the other (75:40 - 75:43)

does you have a girlfriend who's this (75:43 - 75:48)
girl like it's an it's hilarious it's (75:46 - 75:50)
like really fun it's like a two-part (75:48 - 75:53)
episode 1314 and it's adorable but it's (75:50 - 75:55)
also like world-building in a way that (75:53 - 75:58)
that anime uh it's very good at and I (75:55 - 76:00)
ranted about that and there's like few (75:58 - 76:01)

Alex writes in from so Kay in Washington (78:01 - 78:09)
hi s PJ and crew on the last episode 263 (78:05 - 78:12)
you guys talked about what Pokemon game (78:09 - 78:14)
games could do instead of the Elite Four (78:12 - 78:17)
and I've always wanted them to do more (78:14 - 78:19)
like the TV series and do a pokemon (78:17 - 78:22)
tournament of the top 16 or 20 trainers (78:19 - 78:24)
and you would face arrival in the finals (78:22 - 78:27)
but an order but the order of other (78:24 - 78:30)
trainers are random I think it would add (78:27 - 78:32)
a lot more fun and replay value to the (78:30 - 78:34)
game would love to hear your thoughts on (78:32 - 78:37)
this love this show and keep up the good (78:34 - 78:40)
job Alex didn't they do something like (78:37 - 78:43)
that black and white with the with the (78:40 - 78:45)
tournament where they brought back all (78:43 - 78:47)
Gym Leaders and people got excited and (78:45 - 78:49)
then no one cared did they do that I (78:47 - 78:51)
thought was black and white - they did (78:49 - 78:53)
something like champion tournament (78:51 - 78:55)
oh maybe it wasn't like structured like (78:53 - 78:58)
he's talking but it was like something (78:55 - 79:00)
of like in Smash Brothers you sounds (78:58 - 79:02)
read up a tournament earlier yeah and I (79:00 - 79:04)
think it Marty can you do that mark our (79:02 - 79:06)
date actually set up a legit tournament (79:04 - 79:09)
uh well the only way that you can get (79:06 - 79:11)
which it depends which one deluxe I (79:09 - 79:13)
thought no I thought that we you on you (79:11 - 79:15)
could o the we won you yeah the we you (79:13 - 79:16)
one you could set up tournaments and (79:15 - 79:19)
then people could join them once you I (79:16 - 79:22)
guess I don't know advertised it around (79:19 - 79:24)
when I say tournament I mean like a (79:22 - 79:28)
bracket tournament yeah yes like (79:24 - 79:28)
Oh (79:28 - 79:30)
not all people I don't think there was (79:31 - 79:37)
was their bracket stuff in March there's (79:35 - 79:39)
bracket stuff definitely Smash Brothers (79:37 - 79:41)
you're talking to like the least (79:39 - 79:44)
competitive play person on the planet uh (79:41 - 79:47)
I don't know if like a bracket at the (79:44 - 79:50)
end of a Pokemon game would be (79:47 - 79:53)
like that's that sounds cooler than it (79:50 - 79:56)
probably is an execution I think it (79:53 - 80:01)
would be cool to be able to do that for (79:56 - 80:04)
on line play for like play with other (80:01 - 80:07)
people as far as like an NPC are they (80:04 - 80:09)
saying like an NPC bracket that you (80:07 - 80:11)
would do yeah like everyone would be (80:09 - 80:13)
random except for you working your way (80:11 - 80:17)
up the bracket right uh yeah I don't I (80:13 - 80:19)
mean I I could see it being really fun (80:17 - 80:21)
and being something that people really (80:19 - 80:24)
enjoy if it's for multiplayer I don't (80:21 - 80:27)
necessarily know about against NPC's if (80:24 - 80:29)
it would be I do like the concept of a (80:27 - 80:32)
tournament though yeah because that is (80:29 - 80:34)
probably some of the best anime episodes (80:32 - 80:37)
as one Ash's in like a eight episode (80:34 - 80:39)
tournament and so you don't have the (80:37 - 80:42)
standard we have an issue with one (80:39 - 80:44)
Pokemon Team Rocket comes tries to steal (80:42 - 80:47)
Pikachu we solve the issue with the one (80:44 - 80:50)
pokémon ash still refuses to catch the (80:47 - 80:51)
Pokemon because he's a terrible trainer (80:50 - 80:54)
and then the episodes over and then also (80:51 - 80:57)
loses the tournament that he's in yeah (80:54 - 81:00)
yeah yeah cuz it's ash but the (80:57 - 81:01)
tournaments don't have that story they (81:00 - 81:04)
just have usually two to three battles (81:01 - 81:07)
right makes it enjoyable to watch I like (81:04 - 81:10)
the concept Alex I just don't know how (81:07 - 81:12)
you would execute that in a game without (81:10 - 81:17)
it feeling so time wasty I guess I don't (81:12 - 81:18)
know I feel like the Pokemon already is (81:17 - 81:21)
so sluggish in everything it executes (81:18 - 81:24)
yeah I like I even have a hard time (81:21 - 81:26)
doing like battle tower and stuff like (81:24 - 81:29)
that just because I don't know I don't (81:26 - 81:32)
see the personally I don't see the (81:29 - 81:35)
return on it I guess I'm not as (81:32 - 81:38)
interested in what I get in in going (81:35 - 81:40)
through it or completing it or whatever (81:38 - 81:43)
so I I could see other people liking (81:40 - 81:47)
that but me personally it's not what I'm (81:43 - 81:49)
not what I'm into Michelle writes in (81:47 - 81:54)
from West Babylon New York hey guys I (81:49 - 81:56)
just wanted to re-emphasize my (81:54 - 81:59)
appreciation for your podcast as two of (81:56 - 82:02)
the three of regular podcasts have ended (81:59 - 82:05)
with ISE being the only one left I love (82:02 - 82:07)
that I can always count on you guys for (82:05 - 82:09)
an amazing show I wonder what other (82:07 - 82:11)
podcasts threw in the towel secondly I (82:09 - 82:14)
want to add that I continue to love how (82:11 - 82:15)
the podcasts (82:14 - 82:17)
more serious subjects last week Steve (82:15 - 82:21)
shared his point of view as a part of an (82:17 - 82:23)
interracial couple and it was so amazing (82:21 - 82:25)
to hear that I am NOT alone my husband (82:23 - 82:28)
is Puerto Rican and we certainly get (82:25 - 82:30)
treated weird even though we live in New (82:28 - 82:32)
York when we show up for dinner (82:30 - 82:34)
reservations for example I definitely (82:32 - 82:37)
get weird looks I the whitest girl ever (82:34 - 82:40)
say my last name is chant Sanchez then (82:37 - 82:42)
continue to get weird looks when my (82:40 - 82:45)
husband comes in from the front parking (82:42 - 82:47)
the car and he's the only Latino in the (82:45 - 82:50)
building besides the Busboys what is sad (82:47 - 82:51)
to me as well is that my husband (82:50 - 82:53)
actually gets treated better by his (82:51 - 82:55)
Latino friends and families as well by (82:53 - 82:58)
his truck as well as by strangers (82:55 - 83:01)
because he is being seen as successful (82:58 - 83:03)
for marrying a white girl but shouldn't (83:01 - 83:05)
be like that in the end we all handle it (83:03 - 83:07)
the same way Steven the same way as (83:05 - 83:10)
Steve and Irene just by laughing it off (83:07 - 83:12)

happened to me over the weekend that (83:26 - 83:31)
that I could tell but now just same (83:28 - 83:36)

sometimes things happens though just (83:39 - 83:44)
boring well that's the ayat that's (83:41 - 83:45)
really sweet (83:44 - 83:47)
yeah I appreciate it this is from Toby (83:45 - 83:49)
just wanted to thank everyone for making (83:47 - 83:51)
the podcast a great show this is the (83:49 - 83:53)
best source of Pokemon news and I just (83:51 - 83:55)
love it overall thanks for a great year (83:53 - 83:57)
of Pokemon news and hopefully more to (83:55 - 83:59)
come I started listening about last fab (83:57 - 84:03)
February from Toby thanks man (83:59 - 84:06)
hey welcome this is from Dustin from (84:03 - 84:10)
Flagstaff Arizona a Lola I just had a (84:06 - 84:12)
couple of questions for all of you (84:10 - 84:14)
first off Steve has talked about (84:12 - 84:17)
introducing a sound type for several (84:14 - 84:18)
times of the show so I was wondering (84:17 - 84:20)
which types would be super effective (84:18 - 84:23)
against sound type which would not be (84:20 - 84:26)
very effective secondly I want to tell (84:23 - 84:27)
you guys my all-time favorite Pokemon (84:26 - 84:30)
team and what I would like to hear which (84:27 - 84:31)
of them you like the best my favorite (84:30 - 84:34)
Pokemon is veteran and the other five (84:31 - 84:36)
that I would have on a dream team would (84:34 - 84:38)
be be drill shackle Esper vespiqueen and (84:36 - 84:41)
heat more which of these six type of (84:38 - 84:43)
pokemon do you prefer thanks for your (84:41 - 84:47)
show Dustin sounds like Dustin love some (84:43 - 84:51)
bug Pokemon oh yeah man yeah here's some (84:47 - 84:53)
good choices I really like mega Beedrill (84:51 - 84:56)
but I also like vespiqueen mostly (84:53 - 84:59)
because I like cumbia hot yeah I like (84:56 - 85:03)
combi and vespiqueen just in the concept (84:59 - 85:05)
of the Pokemon heat Mars pretty cool (85:03 - 85:06)
just because heat more has that like (85:05 - 85:10)
ultimate rivalry with the Durant which I (85:06 - 85:15)
find I do love that as well it's like a (85:10 - 85:18)
weird caillou relationship (85:15 - 85:21)
ah but yeah all this although sound (85:18 - 85:23)
great I probably go with Beedrill I mean (85:21 - 85:26)
I like that vespiqueen quite a bit is it (85:23 - 85:29)
queen or court vespiquen isn't it like (85:26 - 85:32)
is it clean with 1e (85:29 - 85:36)
so that's probably skewed in some way (85:32 - 85:39)
vespiquen I don't know did we talk about (85:36 - 85:43)
we can poke my name's do you know Bidoof (85:39 - 85:46)
or Bidoof is what what what I always (85:43 - 85:50)
hear yes but it's actually Bidoof is it (85:46 - 85:53)
really that is what the anime has told (85:50 - 85:57)
me and my whole life is a lie but it (85:53 - 85:59)
makes sense if you think about it (85:57 - 86:05)
because Bidoof is a beaver oh man so why (85:59 - 86:09)
isn't it like be Edie oh oh f I guess (86:05 - 86:12)
that would be like not you've it's funny (86:09 - 86:13)
because when I go to like live shows and (86:12 - 86:16)
stuff and I and probably when people (86:13 - 86:18)
listen to this and I say Pokemon names (86:16 - 86:20)
wrong and they probably are very upset (86:18 - 86:22)
in their car that I'm pronouncing it (86:20 - 86:25)
wrong I have never ever heard a person (86:22 - 86:31)
say Bidoof nope neither and now I am I'm (86:25 - 86:32)
laying it out here I am correct like (86:31 - 86:34)
this is the name and there's going to be (86:32 - 86:36)
those listeners are gonna be like no way (86:34 - 86:38)
I'm just gonna call it Bidoof because (86:36 - 86:40)
that's what I've always called it and (86:38 - 86:42)
that's fine but if you're the ever the (86:40 - 86:44)
listener that is then correcting me when (86:42 - 86:47)
I say you know sunflora now I can't say (86:44 - 86:49)
something wrong it's pretty easy what's (86:47 - 86:51)
it the name I mess up I can best (86:49 - 86:54)
vespiquen vespiquen I don't know what (86:51 - 86:54)
that is (86:54 - 86:57)
it could be vespiqueen it could be a (86:54 - 86:59)
good one a good one that I know (86:57 - 87:01)
Arceus is what I hear a lot but it's not (86:59 - 87:04)
actually Arceus right ah that I know for (87:01 - 87:06)
sure because of the the anime and then (87:04 - 87:08)
the other one that I hear people say (87:06 - 87:10)
wrong Oh sighs are some people say (87:08 - 87:11)
scissor I'm not sure what that one is (87:10 - 87:12)
yet (87:11 - 87:14)
sighs or scissor I don't know I don't (87:12 - 87:16)
know which one it is I've always said (87:14 - 87:20)
size or and I've always said uh Arceus I (87:16 - 87:23)
know that it's wrong I just it's so (87:20 - 87:25)
engrained at this point that it's hard (87:23 - 87:27)
for me to remember to to not say it that (87:25 - 87:28)
way (87:27 - 87:31)
another one is ricotta because requires (87:28 - 87:33)
actual pronunciation is do you know what (87:31 - 87:36)
it is uh no I don't I thought it was (87:33 - 87:40)
request no its Rayquaza requisite yep (87:36 - 87:44)
I'm out of here so at the end of the day (87:40 - 87:46)
I really don't care how people pronounce (87:44 - 87:48)
Pokemon names because if you say (87:46 - 87:51)
Rayquaza or request or size or scissor I (87:48 - 87:53)
still know exactly what Pokemon you're (87:51 - 87:55)
talking about I just think it's like I (87:53 - 87:57)
think it's kind of petty when people (87:55 - 88:00)
correct on that stuff yeah of like oh uh (87:57 - 88:04)
clearly you know past the first 150 (88:00 - 88:07)
Pokemon tuned over a quaza but you said (88:04 - 88:09)
it wrong it's like chill out like we (88:07 - 88:11)
both like Pokemon it's alright just (88:09 - 88:12)
relax (88:11 - 88:15)
so just dumb character names relax (88:12 - 88:19)
buster but it is B dude uh I'm curious (88:15 - 88:21)
why they have never included in the (88:19 - 88:23)
pokedex entries pronunciations (88:21 - 88:26)
why have they never done that I would (88:23 - 88:28)
assume cuz audio files take up way more (88:26 - 88:31)
no no no no not like an audio file like (88:28 - 88:34)
a like a like for it like an enunciation (88:31 - 88:36)
break phonetic that's an kinetics (88:34 - 88:39)
like breakdown of it why don't they (88:36 - 88:41)
include that in the pokedex entry they (88:39 - 88:42)
know that everybody's saying I'm wrong (88:41 - 88:45)
maybe that's why they don't because they (88:42 - 88:49)
like they enjoy listening to everybody (88:45 - 88:52)
say them wrong yeah I mean we've had two (88:49 - 88:55)
or three voice actors from the anime on (88:52 - 88:58)
the show before and every time I've (88:55 - 88:59)
asked them (88:58 - 89:01)
I've asked them all the same question (88:59 - 89:04)
it's how accurate are you guys (89:01 - 89:06)
pronouncing the names and they have (89:04 - 89:09)
always said like they take they make (89:06 - 89:11)
sure that we are saying the right name (89:09 - 89:13)
before we you know do the episode (89:11 - 89:16)
whether that is you know let's say that (89:13 - 89:19)
are introducing I don't know Metapod (89:16 - 89:21)
this episode make sure that they say it (89:19 - 89:23)
the way that Pokemon company wants it to (89:21 - 89:25)
be said if you're listening to this (89:23 - 89:29)
podcast and you are in charge of naming (89:25 - 89:31)
the Pokemon through a through (89:29 - 89:34)
localization I have a lot of questions I (89:31 - 89:37)
want to know more about this I need to (89:34 - 89:40)
understand this process better going (89:37 - 89:42)
back to the the first question what (89:40 - 89:44)
would sound type be strong and weak (89:42 - 89:47)
against I don't know I guess I never (89:44 - 89:50)
really thought that far I thought maybe (89:47 - 89:53)
sound type would be weak to steal (89:50 - 89:56)
alright yeah I can see that steel boar (89:53 - 89:59)
and like a long against steel if is (89:56 - 90:01)
causing separation so steel is only (89:59 - 90:05)
strong against ice and rock and ferry (90:01 - 90:08)
so for steel to have another strength I (90:05 - 90:09)
think you're on to something (90:08 - 90:13)
alright now what about weakness though I (90:09 - 90:16)
would probably say that sound would be (90:13 - 90:19)
weak against electric or weight because (90:16 - 90:21)
the electric could weak to steal but (90:19 - 90:24)
strong to electric know also weak to (90:21 - 90:27)
electric Oh also weak to electric yeah I (90:24 - 90:29)
feel like you have to have two (90:27 - 90:33)
weaknesses okay so electric and steel (90:29 - 90:36)
would be its weakness what's the (90:33 - 90:38)
reasoning for electric because like (90:36 - 90:40)
electric could distort the sound waves (90:38 - 90:44)
is of too much electricity okay or speed (90:40 - 90:47)
maybe speed of light versus speed of (90:44 - 90:48)
sound that's true (90:47 - 90:51)
ah here you put a lot of thought of it (90:48 - 90:54)
I mean we're designing a new type here (90:51 - 90:57)
essentially I would say that sound would (90:54 - 91:02)
probably be strong against bug ear type (90:57 - 91:04)
because you can buy those like sound (91:02 - 91:07)
things to put in your basement to keep (91:04 - 91:10)
bugs out or other critters ooh (91:07 - 91:13)
excuse me like that thing yeah like (91:10 - 91:15)
there are these things you can plug in (91:13 - 91:17)
for I'm sure there's disposable ones (91:15 - 91:20)
that when you plug it in it emits this (91:17 - 91:23)
low-frequency noise that keeps like bugs (91:20 - 91:25)
or rodents away from your basement (91:23 - 91:30)
that's interesting I am probably strong (91:25 - 91:33)
against like flying as well I don't know (91:30 - 91:36)
how unbalanced for balance this is but (91:33 - 91:38)
or maybe flying would be strong and (91:36 - 91:43)
sound yeah this the likes weak to sound (91:38 - 91:47)
is where I'm I'm having issues well if (91:43 - 91:50)
if our listeners have any thoughts (91:47 - 91:51)
please email us (91:50 - 91:54)
well we'll share those probably much (91:51 - 91:56)
better thoughts than we've had in the (91:54 - 91:59)
last well we got two minutes I mean I (91:56 - 92:01)
read that email initially and I thought (91:59 - 92:02)
about it for a second and then I was (92:01 - 92:04)
like I'll think about it again when the (92:02 - 92:07)
podcast comes now that panned up and (92:04 - 92:09)
here we are let's jump over to our (92:07 - 92:14)
pokemon of the week based off of one of (92:09 - 92:16)
Pat's favorite Pokemon we're going to do (92:14 - 92:17)
Snorlax this week (92:16 - 92:20)
Snorlax fun fact eighty eighty seven (92:17 - 92:22)
point five percent male twelve point (92:20 - 92:24)
five percent female one of those nine (92:22 - 92:27)
fifty fifty pokemons that exist in the (92:24 - 92:30)
Pokemon universe get a move set here (92:27 - 92:32)
from Kevin and Brandon in slack looks (92:30 - 92:34)
like they work together a little bit so (92:32 - 92:36)
if you're running a competitive Snorlax (92:34 - 92:40)
in the current format you're going to (92:36 - 92:43)
want to do brave nature with six hundred (92:40 - 92:49)
move not 668 V's in HP 196 and attack (92:43 - 92:52)
244 in defense the ability gluttony (92:49 - 92:55)
holding a leper a lap a berry a leper (92:52 - 92:59)
lappa lapa Lepanto berry they exit you (92:55 - 93:02)
got it if possible you want the zero IVs (92:59 - 93:07)
and speed with the move set curse return (93:02 - 93:10)
recycle and high horse power that's (93:07 - 93:12)
actually my motto in life first you (93:10 - 93:15)
curse then you return then you recycle (93:12 - 93:17)
and then you just run high horse power (93:15 - 93:19)
all the way home Kevin writes the (93:17 - 93:21)
Snorlax uses curse to build up its (93:19 - 93:24)
attack and defense a heals up with the (93:21 - 93:27)
the la Papa berry and then can reuse it (93:24 - 93:30)
with recycle lapak lapak a berry is (93:27 - 93:32)
great because it restores 50 percent of (93:30 - 93:35)
health while the wreck with the (93:32 - 93:39)
recommended nature gluttony pairs with (93:35 - 93:42)
the with it because Nora likes eats it (93:39 - 93:45)
at 50% health instead of the normal 25% (93:42 - 93:47)
Oh eats it at 50% (93:45 - 93:51)
instead of 25% left return it is your (93:47 - 93:55)
stab move same a type attack bonus high (93:51 - 93:58)
horse powers will get your coverage for (93:55 - 94:00)
partners you're going to want to use (93:58 - 94:01)
this in a trick room team obviously (94:00 - 94:05)
Snorlax being as slow as it is new and (94:01 - 94:06)
like a fine wine you're going to want a (94:05 - 94:10)
person relax with mimic you for type cut (94:06 - 94:10)
yes (94:10 - 94:14)
porygon to is also a good Pokemon pair (94:10 - 94:16)
that with for again type coverage (94:14 - 94:19)
mothers just mimic you so there you go (94:16 - 94:22)
move set their little competitiveness in (94:19 - 94:24)
your life if you get a shiny Snorlax it (94:22 - 94:27)
is a royal blue instead of that greenish (94:24 - 94:31)
blue that you normally get any pokemon (94:27 - 94:34)
stadium series Snorlax opens their eyes (94:31 - 94:38)
when they faint in Pokemon snap Snorlax (94:34 - 94:40)
stands up and dances to them to music (94:38 - 94:42)
when the poké flute is used and (94:40 - 94:44)
HeartGold and SoulSilver if the player (94:42 - 94:47)
interacts with snarl interacts with (94:44 - 94:49)
Snorlax that is walking with them at (94:47 - 94:52)
Mount Silver the the message quote (94:49 - 94:55)
Snorlax is feeling very eager and quote (94:52 - 94:59)
will appear this is due to read who is (94:55 - 95:01)
also at mount silver also or owning a (94:59 - 95:04)
Snorlax while the player arm out (95:01 - 95:06)
Silver's unique message will also appear (95:04 - 95:08)
if the player interacts while walking (95:06 - 95:12)
with a Pikachu or a Charizard Sonic's (95:08 - 95:14)
has the highest base stat total of all (95:12 - 95:16)
pokémon that can hatch from an egg (95:14 - 95:19)
pokemon gold and silver Snorlax is (95:16 - 95:21)
programmed to be able to learn charm (95:19 - 95:23)
through breeding but no other Pokemon in (95:21 - 95:25)
the monster group can legitimately learn (95:23 - 95:27)
it to pass it down as an egg move in (95:25 - 95:30)
those games in generation 3 Snorlax (95:27 - 95:33)
inherit the move from Bulbasaur by chain (95:30 - 95:35)
breeding I'm finally Snorlax is the (95:33 - 95:37)
heaviest normal (95:35 - 95:40)
Pokemon did you say in Stadium it opens (95:37 - 95:42)
its eyes when it gets knocked out yes (95:40 - 95:45)
and then it also says in later 3d 3d (95:42 - 95:47)
games so I don't know if that applies to (95:45 - 95:50)
Sun and Moon I can't recall I don't (95:47 - 95:53)
think I've ever seen that animation I'm (95:50 - 95:54)
sure I've knocked out a snarl accident (95:53 - 95:56)
Sun and Moon but I don't remember it (95:54 - 95:59)
there had to I need to look into this (95:56 - 96:00)
